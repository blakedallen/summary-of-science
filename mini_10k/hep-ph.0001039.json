We find that these experiments could probe majoron neutrino\ninteractions with improved sensitivity.\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe solar [1] and atmospheric [2] neutrino problems have provided two milestones in\nthe search for physics beyond the Standard Model, giving strong evidence for \u03bde and\n\u03bd\u03bc conversions, respectively.\n\nAlthough flavour changing neutral current interactions\n\n(FCNC) [3, 4, 5] and/or neutrino decays [6] may play an important r\u00f4le in the interpretation of the data [7, 8, 9], we concentrate here on oscillations involving very small\nneutrino mass splittings, because they provide the simplest picture [10, 11, 12]. Moreover,\nreconciling the LSND data [13] and/or hot dark matter suggests the existence of a light\nsterile neutrino [14]. Pending the confirmation of LSND results by future experiments,\nwe choose however to use in this work just the solar and atmospheric data assuming the\nabsence of sterile neutrinos, FCNC and/or of heavier neutrinos.\nWithin the simplest extensions of the Standard Model in which neutrino masses are\nintroduced by an explicit breaking of lepton\u2013number via the seesaw mechanism there are\nneutral-current-mediated neutrino decays \u03bd \u2032 \u2192 3\u03bd [3], but these decays are extremely\n\nslow for the neutrino masses of interest for us here. If neutrino masses arise from the\nspontaneous violation of ungauged lepton number, the corresponding Goldstone boson\n[15] brings in the possibility of new, potentially faster, 2-body neutrino decays [6],\n\u03bd\u2032 \u2192 \u03bd + J .\n\n(1)\n\nHowever it is well-known that in the simplest well\u2013motivated majoron models the neutrino mass and coupling matrices are proportional, so that decays are highly suppressed in\nvacuo 1 [16]. As a result, neutrino decays become cosmologically and astrophysically irrelevant in these models. Moreover, for the small masses indicated by solar and atmospheric\nneutrino data, the annihilation channels \u03bd \u2032 + \u03bd \u2032 \u2192 J + J are also negligible.\n\nThe purpose of the present work is to discuss the possible impact of neutrino-majoron\n\ninteractions on the supernova (SN) neutrino signal. Together with the early Universe\nSN are the only site where neutrinos are in thermal equilibrium and so abundant that\nneutrino-neutrino interactions become important. Therefore, SN physics has been one of\nthe main tools to derive limits on neutrino parameters in majoron models [18, 19, 20, 21].\nThe arguments used in the literature can be divided mainly into two classes: The\nfirst uses the fact that majoron interactions violate lepton number (like in \u03bd \u2192 \u03bd\u0304 + J or\n\u03bd + \u03bd \u2192 \u03bd\u0304 + \u03bd\u0304) and, thereby, can reduce the trapped electron lepton number fraction YLe\n1\n\nThis suppression can be avoided in some models due to a judicious choice of the quantum numbers\n\n[6, 17]. In such case the effects discussed here, although important, are not essential.\n\n2\n\n\fin the SN core [18, 19]. Since in several SN simulations it was found that a minimum value\nof YLe >\n\u223c 0.38 is needed in order to have a successful bounce shock, the strength of the\n\nlepton number violating interactions can be correspondingly restricted. Unfortunately,\n\nthe older works [18] using this argument did not take into account the derivative nature\nof the coupling of a Goldstone boson calculating the scattering cross sections. Moreover,\nan approximation valid only in vacuum was used for the neutrino decay rates. In ref. [19]\nthe correct medium decay rates were used for the first time, giving the stringent limit\n\u22126\ngee <\n\u223c 5 \u00d7 10 .\nThe second argument used is a \"classical\" energy loss argument: the observed neutrino\n\nsignal of SN 1987A should not be shortened too much by additional majoron emission\n[19, 20, 21]. The most comprehensive work along this line is Ref. [21] which also uses the\ncorrect derivative coupling of the majoron. The limits found there depend on the value\n\u22125\nof the (B \u2212 L) breaking scale. For example the range 5 \u00d7 10\u22127 <\n\u223cg<\n\u223c 6 \u00d7 10 is excluded\n\n\u22125\nfor v = 20 GeV while 1 \u00d7 10\u22125 <\n\u223c 7 \u00d7 10 is excluded for v = 500 GeV. The tau\u223cg<\nneutrino masses considered in Ref. [21] are, compared to the values currently discussed,\nrather large, 100 eV <\n\u223c 30 MeV. It is therefore of certain interest to extend their\n\u223c m\u03bd\u03c4 <\n\ndiscussion to lower neutrino masses presently indicated by the solutions to the solar and\natmospheric neutrino anomalies.\nThese astrophysical limits should be confronted with the available laboratory con-\n\nstraints. While there is a stringent limit from \u03b2\u03b2 experiments [22],\nX\ni,j\n\n\u22125\ngij Uei Uej <\n\u223c 3 \u00d7 10 ,\n\n(2)\n\nthe limits from pion [23] and kaon decays [24] are rather weak,\nX\n\nl=e,\u03bc,\u03c4\n\n2 <\n\u22125\ngel\n\u223c 3 \u00d7 10\n\nand\n\nX\n\nl=e,\u03bc,\u03c4\n\n2 <\n\u22124\ng\u03bcl\n\u223c 2.4 \u00d7 10 .\n\n(3)\n\nNote also that individual couplings gij could be larger than the limit from \u03b2\u03b2 experiments\ndue to possible cancellations [25].\nThe main purpose of the present work is the study of the impact of neutrino-majoron\ninteractions on the observable neutrino signal of a supernova. Since decays of the type\n\u03bd\u0304e \u2192 \u03bdl + J reduce the \u03bd\u0304e flux, a limit on the neutrino majoron coupling constants can be\n\nderived from the observed signal of SN 1987A. In so\u2013doing one must include in the analysis\n\nthe fact that massive neutrinos may oscillate on their way from the SN envelope to the\ndetector. We do that and present the excluded regions for the three currently discussed\nsolutions of the solar neutrino problem [10, 11]. Then we estimate the discovery potential\n3\n\n\fof new experiments like Superkamiokande (SK) and the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory\n(SNO) in the case of a future galactic supernova. We find that these experiments could\n\u22125\nprobe majoron neutrino coupling constants g down to g >\n\u223c few \u00d7 10 .\n\n2\n\nMatter effect on neutrino-majoron interactions\n\nWe consider the simplest class of models in which neutrinos acquire mass from the spontaneous violation of ungauged lepton number [15]. In this case it is well-known that the\nmassless Goldstone boson J \u2013 the majoron \u2013 couples diagonally to the mass-eigenstate\nneutrinos \u03bdi to a very good approximation [16]. In other words, after rotation from the\nweak basis \u03bd\u03b1 through \u03b80 angle(s) the original coupling matrix g\u03b1\u03b2 transforms into\ngij \u2248 \u03b4ij gi .\n(hi )\n\nWe denote by \u03bdi\n\n(4)\n\nthe 4-spinor describing the majorana neutrino with mass mi and\n\nhelicity h = \u00b11.\n\nIn this section, we briefly review the effect of a thermal background on the neutrino\n\nmajoron interactions. It was first demonstrated by Berezhiani and Vysotsky in Ref. [26]\nthat the effective mass induced by the interactions of neutrinos with background matter\ncan break the proportionality between the mass matrix mij and the coupling matrix\ngij characteristic of the simplest majoron models in vacuo [16]. A thermal background\nconsists, except in the early Universe, only of particles of the first generation and, therefore\ndistinguishes the electron flavour from the other flavours.\nIn Ref. [26], the Lagrangian describing neutrino majoron interaction in a thermal\nbackground was obtained in a relativistic approximation similar to the usual treatment of\nneutrino oscillations in matter. Later, the authors of Ref. [29] solved this problem without\nusing this approximation and confirmed the results of Ref. [26] in the appropriate limiting\ncases. Here we are concerned with SN neutrinos, which have typical energies around\n10 \u2212 25 MeV. Therefore, we will take advantage of the simpler relativistic approximation\n\nand we will follow closely Ref. [26].\n\nThe Hamiltonian Htot \u2261 H(x) describing the evolution of neutrinos may be given as\nHtot = H0 + Hmed + Hint\n= H0 +\n\nX X\n\n(hi )\n\n\u03bd\u0304i\n\n(5)\nh ,hj (hj )\n\u03bdj\n\nVij i\n\ni,j hi ,hj\n\n4\n\n(hi )\n\n+ gij \u03bd\u0304i\n\n(hj )\n\n\u03b35 \u03bdj\n\nJ,\n\n(6)\n\n\fwhere the free Hamiltonian H0 describes the propagation in vacuo, Hmed describes the\neffects of matter and Hint takes into account the presence of neutrino-majoron interactions\nwhich may lead to decays. Instead of using the eigenstates of the free Hamiltonian H0\nas basis for perturbation theory, we will use the eigenstates of H0 + Hmed .

In the case of\n\nultra-relativistic neutrinos, it is well-known that a vector-like potential does not change\nthe helicity of the neutrinos - its only effect is a rotation of the eigenstates of H0 + V\nwith respect to the mass basis [30].

Finally, U is the mixing matrix relating mass and weak basis and defined through\n(h)\n\n\u03bdi = Ui\u03b1 \u03bd\u03b1 .

This fact will give rise to the following simplification, \u03b8(+) (p) \u2248\n\u2212\u03b80 and \u03b8(\u2212) (p) \u2248 \u03c0/2 \u2212 \u03b80 , which, as it will be shown later, will allow us to identify\n\nmedium and weak interaction states.\n\nIn the three-flavor neutrino case the mixing matrix U can be parametrized as U =\nU12 U13 U23 U0 , where the matrices Uij = Uij (\u03b8ij ) perform the rotation in the ij-plane by the\nangle \u03b8ij and U0 includes possible CP-violation effects [3]. In the following we will assume\nfor simplicity CP conservation and \u03b813 = 0, the latter motivated both by detailed fits of\nthe atmospheric neutrino anomaly, but also by the results of the Chooz experiment [27].\nThis simplifies the mixing matrix to \u03bdi = Ui\u03b1 \u03bd\u03b1 = U12 U23 \u03bd\u03b1 [28] and we can make the\nassignment, \u03b812 = \u03b8\u2299 and \u03b823 = \u03b8atm . Notice that for light neutrinos near the neutrino\nspheres the condition |V\u03b1\u03b1 | \u226b m2i /(2p) (\u03be \u226a 1) holds and, since in the weak basis the\n\npotential is diagonal, the medium states can be identified with the weak ones up to a\nrotation in the \u03bd\u03bc \u2212 \u03bd\u03c4 subspace. The expressions can be simplified by choosing this\n\narbitrary rotation angle to coincide with \u03b823 . Then, only one angle, \u03b8(h) , will be required\nto connect medium and mass eigenstates, and one will be able to recover the two-flavor\nneutrino case,\n(h)\n\u03bd\u0303i\n\n=\n\n(h) (h)\n\u0168ij \u03bdj\n\n= \u0168ij (\u03b8\n\n(h)\n\n(h)\n)\u03bdj\n\n=\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f3\n\n(+)\n\n= \u0168ij (\u2212\u03b812 ) \u03bdj\n\n(\u2212)\n\n= \u0168ij (\u03c0/2 \u2212 \u03b812 ) \u03bdj\n\n\u03bd\u0303i\n\n\u03bd\u0303i\n\n(+)\n(\u2212)\n\n.\n\n(14)\n\nThus the medium states can be identified with weak interaction states according to Table\n1 and the coupling matrix g\u0303ij in the medium basis can be approximated by the one in the\nweak basis, g\u03b1\u03b2 .\nAbove, we have derived the transformation matrix Uij (\u03b8(\u00b1) ) between mass and medium\neigenstates.

Obviously, only those decays\nare possible for which Vi \u2212 Vf > 0.\n\nBesides enhancing the rates for neutrino decay, the dispersive effects of the medium\n\nopen also completely new decay channels of the majoron into neutrinos [31]. The majoron\ndecays J \u2192 \u03bdi\u00b1 + \u03bdj\u00b1 have the same matrix elements like the neutrino decays \u03bdi\u2213 \u2192 \u03bdj\u00b1 + J\n\nconsidered above.

The symmetry factor S is\nS = 1/2 if the two neutrinos are identical, and S = 1 otherwise. Finally, we note that the\nneutrinos are emitted isotropically.\n7\n\n\f3\n\nSupernova neutrinos and neutrino majoron decays\n\nHere we first collect the available limits on majoron neutrino coupling constants from the\nobservation of the neutrino signal of SN 1987A and comment on their validity. Then,\nwe discuss the sensitivity of new experiments like SK or SNO to probe neutrino-majoron\ninteractions in the case of a future galactic supernova.\n\n3.1\n\nConstraints from collapsing phase\n\nMassive stars become inevitably unstable at the end of their life, when their iron core\nreaches the Chandrasekhar limit. The collapse of the iron core is only intercepted when\nnuclear density, \u03c10 \u2248 3 \u00d7 1014 g/cm3 , is reached. At this point, the implosion is turned\n\ninto an explosion: a shock wave forms at the edge of the core and moves outward. The\nstrength of this bounce shock and its successful propagation is extremely sensitive to the\ntrapped electron lepton fraction YLe = Ye + Y\u03bde , attained by the core during its infall. A\nsuccessful SN explosion occurs only if at least 90% of the initial YLe is still present [32],\nwhich translates to YL (tbounce ) >\n\u223c 0.375 [33].\nWe now use this requirement in order to derive a limit on majoron decays. Such\n\ndecays clearly change YLe either by two units (\u03bde \u2192 \u03bd\u0304e + J) or by one (\u03bde \u2192 \u03bd\u0304\u03bc + J).\n\nSince the allowed change in YL is small, we can still use the profiles Ye (t) and Y\u03bde (t) from\na \"standard\" SN simulation [34]. One can easily check from Table 1 that only the first of\nthe above decays takes place, since Ye + 3/2Y\u03bde < 1/2. Hence the deleptonization rate is\ngoverned by\ndYL,decays\n= \u22122\u0393(\u03bde \u2192 \u03bd\u0304e + J)Y\u03bde .\ndt\n\n(19)\n\nWe integrate Eq. (19) numerically from t0 , the time when neutrinos start to become\ntrapped (at \u03c1(t0 ) \u2248 5 \u00d7 1011 g/cm3 ), to the time of the bounce tbounce . Note that in the\n\nnumerical simulation [34] whose results we are using YL increases from YL (t0 ) \u2248 0.37 up\n\nto YL (tbounce ) \u2248 0.39. Requiring that YL (tbounce ) > 0.375 [32, 33], i.e. |\u2206YL,decays | < 0.015,\n\nwe obtain\n\n\u22126\ngee = g11 cos2 \u03b80 + g22 sin2 \u03b80 <\n\u223c 2 \u00d7 10 .\n\n(20)\n\n\u22126\nUsing the same argument, the limit gee <\n\u223c 5 \u00d7 10 was derived in Ref. [19].\nThis limit relies on numerical modeling of SN explosions, in particular on the success of\n\nthe explosion in specific models. However, it is probably fair to say that current supernova\nmodels have generally problems to produce successful explosions. Therefore, Eq. (20)\n8\n\n\fcannot be viewed as a trustworthy limit as long we do not have a better understanding\nof SN dynamics.\n\n3.2\n\nConstraints from majoron luminosity\n\nNumerical computations [35] of the total amount of binding energy Eb released in a supernova explosion yield, within a plausible range of progenitor star masses and somewhat\ndepending on the equation of state used,\nEb = (1.5 \u2212 4.5) \u00d7 1053 erg .\n\n(21)\n\nThis range of values is confirmed by likelihood analysis of the observed \u03bd\u0304e spectrum of\nSN 1987A under the hypothesis of small mixing of \u03bd\u0304e with other neutrino flavours [36].\nTherefore, the parameter space of models which give rise to majoron luminosity large\nenough that the observed \u03bd\u0304e signal is significantly shortened can be restricted. The most\ncomprehensive analysis of SN cooling and majoron emission using this argument was given\nin Ref. [21].\nOur following analysis has three main differences compared to Ref. [21]: First, we\n2\nare interested in relatively light neutrinos (m2 <\n\u223c eV \u226a 2pV ) as suggested by the simplest interpretation of data from solar and atmospheric neutrino experiments. Therefore,\n\nmedium effects become important not only for decays like \u03bd \u2192 \u03bd \u2032 + J but also for scat-\n\ntering processes like J + \u03bd \u2192 J + \u03bd. Second, we do not include the process J + J \u2192 J + J\n\nin the calculation of the majoron opacity. A discussion of why self-scattering processes\ndo not contribute to the opacity was given in Ref. [37] for the case of \u03bd + \u03bd \u2192 \u03bd + \u03bd\n\nscattering. Note that trapping due to J + J \u2192 J + J scattering prevented Choi and San-\n\ntamaria from excluding majoron\u2013neutrino couplings for the case of light neutrino masses,\nm\u03bd\u03c4 <\n\u223c 100 eV. Third, we calculate the majoron luminosity in the trapping regime in a\n\ndifferent way.\n\nLet us discuss first the mean free path of majorons. The main source of opacity for\nmajorons are the processes J +J \u2192 \u03bd +\u03bd, J +\u03bd \u2192 J +\u03bd, and J +\u03bd \u2192 \u03bd (cf. [21]). Taking\n\ninto account the effective mass of the neutrinos, the corresponding mean free paths inside\nthe SN core with radius r0 \u223c 10 km and density \u03c1 \u223c \u03c1nuc are given by,\n\u22121\n\n18 4\n\n\u22121\n\n18 4\n\nl (J + J \u2192 \u03bd + \u03bd) = 1.9 \u00d7 10 g\n\nl (J + \u03bd \u2192 J + \u03bd) = 1.5 \u00d7 10 g\n9\n\nkeV\nmeff\n\n!2 \u0012\n\nT\n25MeV\n\n\u00133\n\ncm\u22121\n\n(22)\n\nkeV\nmeff\n\n!2 \u0012\n\nT\n25MeV\n\n\u00133\n\ncm\u22121\n\n(23)\n\n\f4 2\n\n\u22121\n\nl (\u03bd + J \u2192 \u03bd) = 1 \u00d7 10 g\n\n\u0012\n\nT\ncm\u22121 .\n25MeV\n\u0013\n\n(24)\n\nFor the effective neutrino mass inside the SN core, m2eff \u223c 2pV , we use meff \u223c 20 keV.\nRequiring that the mean free path of the majorons is >\n\u223c 10 km, we obtain that they\n\u22126\nescape freely for g <\n\u223c 3 \u00d7 10 .\nNext, we consider the luminosity for the case that majorons are not trapped. Then\n\nthey are emitted by the whole core volume with luminosity\n!2\n\nkeV\nL(\u03bd + \u03bd \u2192 J + J) = 5.5 \u00d7 10 g\nmeff\n65 2\nL(\u03bd \u2192 \u03bd + J) = 4.8 \u00d7 10 g erg/s .\n80 4\n\nerg/s\n\n(25)\n(26)\n\nWe require now that the majoron luminosity during 10 s does not exceed the maximal\n52\ntheoretical value of the binding energy, LJ <\n\u223c 5 \u00d7 10 erg/s, and obtain the limit g <\n\u223c 3\u00d7\n10\u22127. In the trapping regime, the energy loss argument therefore excludes the band\n\u22126\n3 \u00d7 10\u22127 <\n\u223c 3 \u00d7 10\n\u223cg<\n\n(27)\n\nfor vacuum neutrino masses m \u226a meff \u223c 20 keV.\n\n\u22126\nLet us now discuss the case that majorons are trapped, g >\n\u223c 3 \u00d7 10 . We recall first\nthe standard treatment as presented, e.g., in Ref. [21]. The main assumption is that LJ\n\ncan be approximated by blackbody surface emission\n\n\u03c03 2 4\nR T\n(28)\n30 J\nof a thermal majoron\u2013sphere which radius RJ is defined to be at optical depth 2/3,\nLJ =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nRJ\n\ndr l\u22121 (r) =\n\n2\n.\n3\n\n(29)\n\nAssuming furthermore a temperature profile T (r) outside the supernova core, one can\ndetermine for which range of coupling constants LJ exceeds a certain critical value.\n\nThere are two shortcomings in this argumentation. First, the profile T (r) \u221d r \u22122\n\nused for r > r0 in [21] represents the temperature of ordinary matter (nucleons, e\u00b1 ,\nphotons). However, majorons couple mainly to neutrinos and would at best be in thermal\nequilibrium with neutrinos, if at all, but not with nucleons. Second, the use of Eqs. (2224) which were derived for isotropic distributions inside the core is not justified for the\nhighly non\u2013isotropic distributions outside the neutrino\u2013 or majoron\u2013spheres. Using for\nthe density ni (r) of a particle species i with sphere radius Ri the expression\nni (r) =\n\nLi 1\n,\nhEi i 4\u03c0r 2\n10\n\n(30)\n\n\fand introducing the additional factor h1 \u2212 cos \u03b8i \u223c (Ri /r)2 which represents the averaging\n\nover the angle \u03b8 between the momenta of the radially outgoing test majoron and the\nparticle i in the mean free path one finds that ni (r) \u221d 1/r 4 . This renders support to\nour claim that there is a sharp drop in the majoron opacity in crossing the neutrino\n\nspheres. Note also that it was recently stressed in Ref. [38] that a naive application of the\nStefan-Boltzmann law can be dangerous for the calculation of neutrino\u2013sphere radii.\nWe prefer therefore not to rely on the argumentation presented above. Instead, we\ncalculate the volume rather than the surface luminosity, but taking into account that only\nmajorons emitted from the shell [r0 \u2212 l : r0 ] can escape [19]. We find that the majoron\n\u22125\nluminosity drops below L\u03bd,tot \u223c Eb /10 s for g >\n\u223c 2 \u00d7 10 . Going even to larger values\nof g, majorons and neutrinos are becoming so strongly coupled that it is reasonable to\n\nassume that the SN core emits roughly the same luminosity in form of majorons as in\none neutrino species, ie. LJ \u223c L\u03bd,tot /6. Therefore, majoron emission in this regime is\nnot constrained at all by the energy loss argument. Combining the both limits obtained,\n\nmajoron couplings one concludes that the range\n\u22125\n3 \u00d7 10\u22127 <\n\u223c 2 \u00d7 10\n\u223cg<\n\n(31)\n\nis excluded for vacuum neutrino masses m \u226a meff \u223c 20 keV.\n\nA final remark is in order. We have been using rather loosely only one coupling\n\nconstant g in this section. More precisely, we mean by g the element of the coupling\nmatrix g\u03b1\u03b2 in the weak basis with the largest absolute value.\n\n3.3\n\nConstraints from neutrino spectra\n\nDuring the Kelvin-Helmholtz cooling phase, t \u2248 1 \u2212 10 s after core bounce, the protoneu-\n\ntron star slowly contracts and cools by neutrino emission. The neutrino luminosities are\ngoverned by the energy loss of the core and are, therefore, approximately equal for each\ntype of (anti-) neutrinos. Since the opacity of, e.g., \u03bd\u0304\u03bc,\u03c4 is smaller than of \u03bd\u0304e , due to their\n\nsmaller cross section, their energy-exchanging reactions already freeze out in the denser\npart of the protoneutron star. Hence, one expects the spectral temperatures of \u03bd\u0304e to be\nsmaller than the one of \u03bdh = {\u03bd\u03bc,\u03c4 , \u03bd\u0304\u03bc,\u03c4 }. Typically, the average energies hEi i found in\nsimulations [39] are\n\nhE\u03bde i \u2248 11 MeV ,\n\nhE\u03bd\u0304e i \u2248 16 MeV ,\n\nhE\u03bdh i \u2248 25 MeV .\n\n(32)\n\nIt is convenient to define three energy spheres RE,\u03bde , RE,\u03bd\u0304e and RE,\u03bdh , outside of which\n11\n\n\fonly energy-conserving reactions contribute to the neutrino opacity3 . These reactions,\nmainly neutral current neutrino-nucleon and neutrino-nucleus scattering, do not change\nthe neutrino spectra, although the neutrinos still undergo several scattering as they diffuse\noutward. Eventually, the neutrinos reach the transport sphere at Rt,\u03bdi , where also the\nenergy-conserving reactions freeze out, and escape freely. This sphere, i.e. the surface of\nlast scattering, is what most authors mean with \"the\" neutrino\u2013sphere.\nFor the numerical evaluation of the decay rates, we use profiles for \u03c1(r) and Ye (r) from\nWilson's SN model [40] at the time t = 6 s after core bounce. For all radii of interest,\nonly anti-neutrinos can decay into neutrinos. Correspondingly, the allowed majoron decay\nchannels can be determined from Table 1. For the average position of the various neutrino\u2013\nspheres, we use the implicit definition\n\u03c1(RE,\u03bdh ) = 2 \u00d7 1013 g/cm3 ,\n\n\u03c1(RE,\u03bde ) = 2 \u00d7 1011 g/cm3 ,\n\n\u03c1(RE,\u03bd\u0304e ) = 2 \u00d7 1012 g/cm3 ,\n\n(33)\n\nand\n\u03c1(RT,\u03bdh ) = \u03c1(RT,\u03bd\u0304e ) = \u03c1(RT,\u03bde ) = 2 \u00d7 1011 g/cm3 .\n\n(34)\n\nIn calculating the effect of majoron\u2013emitting neutrino decays on the emitted \u03bd spectra\nwe must distinguish three regions. If a \u03bd\u0304i is produced inside its own energy sphere, r <\nRE,\u03bd\u0304i , it is still in thermal and chemical equilibrium with the stellar medium. Therefore,\nthe production (or the decay) of a \u03bd\u0304i within r < RE,\u03bd\u0304i does not influence the emitted \u03bd\u0304i\nspectrum. In contrast, the spectrum of \u03bd\u0304i neutrinos is fixed for r > RE,\u03bd\u0304i and both its\ndecay or its production changes its spectra. The only difference between the two regions\nRE,\u03bd\u0304i < r < Rt,\u03bd\u0304i and r > Rt,\u03bd\u0304i is the different \"effective\" velocity v of the decaying\nneutrino. In the latter, the neutrino can escape freely (v = 1), while in the first it diffuses\noutward with v \u2248 \u03bb/(RE,\u03bd\u0304i \u2212 Rt,\u03bd\u0304i ). Here, \u03bb is the average mean free path of the neutrino\n\n\u03bd\u0304i . Hence, we can compute the survival probability N(\u03bd\u0304i ) of a \u03bd\u0304i neutrino emitted from\nits energy sphere as\n(\n\nN(\u03bd\u0304i ) = exp \u2212\n\nZ\n\nRt,\u03bd\u0304i\n\nRE,\u03bd\u0304i\n\ndr \u2032\n\u0393\u03bd\u0304i (r \u2032 ) \u2212\nv\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\nRt,\u03bd\u0304i\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\ndr \u0393\u03bd\u0304i (r )\n\n)\n\n,\n\n(35)\n\nwhere\n\u0393\u03bd\u0304i =\n\nX\n\nl=e,\u03bc,\u03c4\n3\n\n\u0393(\u03bd\u0304i \u2192 \u03bdl + J)\n\n(36)\n\nNeutrino-matter interactions are energy\u2013dependent and, therefore, the concept of a neutrino\u2013sphere\n\nis evidently an over-simplification.\n\n12\n\n\fis its total decay rate. Denoting with pij [r1 , r2 ] the probability that the decay \u03bd\u0304i \u2192 \u03bdj + J\nhappens in between r1 and r2 , it follows that\npij [r1 , r2 ] =\nand\n\nP\n\nj\n\nZ\n\nr2\n\nr1\n\ndr \u2032\n\u0393(\u03bd\u0304i \u2192 \u03bdj + J; r \u2032 )N(r \u2032 ) .\nv\n\n(37)\n\npij [r1 , r2 ] + N = 1, where N denotes the neutrino survival probability.\n\nFinally, we have to consider the effect of majoron decays J \u2192 \u03bdi + \u03bdj on the neutrino\n\u22126\nspectra. If g <\n\u223c 3 \u00d7 10 , majorons escape freely. Thus they are emitted by the core with\n\nluminosity given by Eq. (25). For their mean energy we assume hEJ i = 3T \u223c 50 MeV, so\n\nthat the number of emitted majorons per unit time is NJ = LJ /hEJ i. In the intermediate\n\u22125\nregime, 3 \u00d7 10\u22126 <\n\u223c 2 \u00d7 10 , we use the same average energy for the majorons but\n\u223cg<\n\nuse the reduced luminosity due to emission from the shell [r0 \u2212 l : r0 ]. Finally, for\n\u22125\ng>\n\u223c 2 \u00d7 10 , we identify simply the majoron\u2013sphere RJ with the energy sphere of the\n\nneutrino species which has the largest coupling to the majoron. In the following, we will\n\nuse RJ = RE,\u03bdh and we will also assume that its average energy is similar to the one of\n\u03bdh , hEJ i \u2248 hE\u03bdh i \u2248 25 MeV.\n\nThe decay probability P = 1 \u2212 N of a majoron is given by\n\u001a\n\nN(J) = exp \u2212\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nRJ\n\ndr \u2032 \u0393J (r \u2032 )\n\n\u001b\n\n(38)\n\nTogether with the majoron luminosity LJ this allows us to calculate the spectra of the\n\nproduced neutrinos.\n3.3.1\n\nNeutrino signal from SN1987A\n\nThe existing observational data on the supernova SN 1987A were already used in Ref. [41],\nin order to constrain the allowed permutation between the \u03bd\u0304e and all other types of\nneutrinos as a result of neutrino oscillations. At 99% (95%) confidence level, it was found\nthat no more than 35% (23%) of the \u03bd\u0304e flux could be converted into \u03bd\u0304\u03bc,\u03c4 or \u03bd\u03bc,\u03c4 . This limit\ncan be applied to any process which diminishes the flux of \u03bd\u0304e and is only weakly energy\ndependent, such as the case of medium-induced neutrino decays. Thus one can apply\ntheir results in order to restrict the neutrino decay models under consideration here.\nSince \u03bd\u03bc and \u03bd\u03c4 feel the same potential, the decay rates \u0393(\u03bd\u0304e \u2192 \u03bd\u03bc +J) and \u0393(\u03bd\u0304e \u2192 \u03bd\u03c4 +\n\n2\n2\n2\nJ) differ only due to their different coupling constants. We define therefore geh\n= ge\u03bc\n+ ge\u03c4\n\nand present the region excluded by the SN 1987A signal in Fig. 1 in the gee \u2212 geh plane.\n\nThe region excluded at 95% confidence level corresponds approximately to the one given\n13\n\n\fby the condition\n2\n2\n2 >\n\u22127\ngee\n+ ge\u03bc\n+ ge\u03c4\n\u223c 1 \u00d7 10 .\n\n(39)\n\nUp to now, we have neglected that massive neutrinos do not simply decay but may\nalso oscillate on their way. In the high-density region where the decays occur this approximation is legitimate because the medium states coincide essentially with the weak\nflavour eigenstates.\nHowever, the SN 1987A neutrinos must also propagate first through the SN envelope,\nthen through vacuum before they cross the Earth on the way to the detectors. Let us consider now what will be the impact of neutrino oscillations for the three popular solutions\nthe solar neutrino problem, namely small-angle (SMA) MSW, large-angle (LMA) MSW\nand the just-so or vacuum oscillations4 . These solutions are characterized by particular values of \u22060 and sin2 2\u03b80 , which define different regimes in the dynamics of neutrino\npropagation through the supernova.\nLet us first analyze the two MSW solutions. For the usual neutrino mass hierarchy,\nanti-neutrinos will not encounter an MSW resonance on their way through the SN envelope. Furthermore, they propagate adiabatically, because in both cases \u22060 \u223c 10\u22125 eV2 .\nTherefore, neutrinos that had been created as \u03bd\u03031+ (\u03c1) \u2248 \u03bd\u0304e leave the star as \u03bd\u03031+ (\u03c1 = 0) = \u03bd1+ ,\n\ni.e. as a definite mass eigenstate. Consequently, no neutrino oscillations take place on the\nway from the SN to the Earth and the probability of \u03bd\u0304e \u2192 \u03bd\u0304\u03bc transitions (permutation\n\nfactor) equals Posc = |h\u03bd\u0304\u03bc |\u03bd\u03031+ i|2 = sin2 \u03b80 , as long as matter effects in the Earth can be\nneglected. Since decays \u03bd\u0304\u03b1 \u2192 \u03bd\u03b2 and oscillations \u03bd\u0304\u03b1 \u2194 \u03bd\u0304\u03b2 are decoupled, the total survival\nprobability can be written as\n\nN = Ndecay Nosc = Ndecay (1 \u2212 Posc ) .\n\n(40)\n\nwhere Posc is the neutrino conversion probability due to oscillations.\nIn the SMA-MSW case, sin2 2\u03b80 \u2248 7 \u00d7 10\u22123 , oscillations can be neglected both in the\n\nSN envelope and in the Earth, so that Posc \u2248 0. Thus, one can use directly the results\nobtained above, shown in Fig. 1.\n\nIn contrast, the matter effect inside the Earth has to be taken into account in the\nLMA-MSW case, for which sin2 2\u03b80 \u2248 0.6 [10]. The permutation probabilities due to\n\noscillations is given by,\n\nPosc = sin2 2\u03b80 \u2212 sin 2\u03b8 sin(2\u03b80 \u2212 2\u03b8) sin2 (\u03c0d/losc ) .\n4\n\nWe follow closely the discussion given in Refs. [36, 41].\n\n14\n\n(41)\n\n\fThe distance d traveled inside the Earth by the neutrinos and the average density \u03c1 are\ndifferent for Kamiokande and IMB detectors. For Kamiokande we have d = 3900 km and\n\u03c1 = 3.4 g/cm3 while for IMB d = 8400 km and \u03c1 = 4.6 g/cm3 . As an approximation\nwe will use therefore the average value Posc = (12Posc,Kam + 8Posc,IBM )/20 according to\nthe number of events detected in each detector. In Fig. 2, we show the excluded region\nfor sin2 2\u03b80 = 0.6, \u22060 = 10\u22125 eV2 , and in addition the experimental limit Eq. (3). The\ncoupling g22 is fixed by\ns\n\ng22 = g11 1 +\n\n\u22060\n.\nm21\n\n(42)\n\nTherefore, for m1 /\u22060 \u2192 0, g22 becomes larger for constant g11 . Hence, the limit on g11\n\nbecomes stronger. Note also that we can not fix g33 by the solar neutrino data. Therefore,\nwe have set conservatively g33 = 0. As can be seen from the Fig. 2, for the range of masses\ninvolved, the values g11 > 10\u22124 are excluded at 95% C.L.\nThe remaining case to consider is the 'just-so' solution, in which \u22060 \u2248 10\u221210 eV2 . For\n\nsuch small values of the mass splitting, the neutrino propagation out of the SN is nonadiabatic. Therefore, neutrinos leave the SN envelope as flavor eigenstates which then\noscillate on their way to the Earth. Taking into account that in this case the Earth effect\nis unimportant, their averaged permutation probability due to oscillation is simply\nPosc =\n\n1\nsin2 2\u03b80 .\n2\n\n(43)\n\nLet us consider now the typical value sin2 2\u03b80 \u2248 0.9 [11]. Then, according to the analysis\n\nof Ref. [41], this case is already disfavored assuming only oscillation. In any case for\ncompleteness we have plotted in Fig. 3 the regions corresponding to P = 0.55, 0.7 and the\nexperimental limit Eq. (3).\nTo summarize, the limits we have obtained in this subsection from the observed \u03bd\u0304e\nsignal of SN 1987A are more than one order of magnitude stronger than the limit from\npion decay. They require as theoretical input some knowledge about the spectral shape\nof the emitted neutrino fluences (e.g. hE\u03bdi i) and are therefore to a certain extent model\ndependent. However this model dependence is much weaker than that implicit in the limit\nfrom the collapsing phase (20).\n3.3.2\n\nConstraints from a future galactic supernova\n\nThe neutrino signal from SN 1987A observed by Kamiokande and IBM confirmed the\ngeneral astrophysical picture of a supernova explosion. However the small number of\n15\n\n\fobserved neutrinos prevents a sensitive probe of neutrino properties or of the equation of\nstate of super\u2013dense matter. Meanwhile, several new experiments like Super\u2013Kamiokande\nor the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) have been constructed and it seems therefore\ninteresting to estimate their sensitivity to new physics, such as the majoron\u2013emitting\nneutrino decays, through their ability to determine the spectra of SN neutrinos.\nAll detectors in the near future can detect SN only in our own Galaxy and in the\nLarge and Small Magellanic Cloud, with however a much smaller rate than expected for\nthe Milky Way. Therefore, we use in the following 10 kpc as the reference distance to the\nhypothetical Supernova. Then, according to Ref. [42], the number of \u03bd\u0304e + p \u2192 n + e+\n\nevents expected in SK is 5310, compared to 220 events in all other channels. While a lightwater detector like SK acts like a \u03bd\u0304e filter, a heavy-water detector has a broad response\nto all types of neutrinos: from the total of 781 events expected at SNO, 200 events are\nneutral-current reactions of \u03bdh (=\u03bd\u03bc , \u03bd\u0304\u03bc , \u03bd\u03c4 or \u03bd\u0304\u03c4 ) with deuterium. In addition, there are\n82 charged-current reactions of \u03bde with deuterium. The combined spectral information\nof these reactions should contain the major part of the information extractable from all\ndata. In the following, we will consider therefore only the reaction \u03bd\u0304e + p \u2192 n + e+ for\n\nSK, and \u03bdh + d \u2192 \u03bdh + n + p and \u03bde + d \u2192 p + p + e\u2212 for SNO.\n\nThe predicted number of events has a rather strong dependence on how the cooling of\n\nthe SN is modeled. In Ref. [43], e.g., the expected number of \u03bdh + d \u2192 \u03bdh + n + p reactions\n\nis 485 in SNO. An important question is therefore how well different astrophysical and/or\nparticle physics processes (e.g. neutrino oscillations versus decays) can be disentangled\nusing observational data. We will comment shortly on this question at the end of this\nsection.\nThe neutrino spectrum n\u03bd (E\u03bd ) emitted by the SN can be be inferred in a rather indirect\nway from the experimentally measured energies Ei of the observed events. Let us consider\nfirst the reaction \u03bd\u0304e + p \u2192 n + e+ and \u03bde + d \u2192 p + p + e\u2212 . Experimentally, the neutrino\n\nenergy E\u03bd is reconstructed in both reactions from the number of photo-multipliers that\nhave been triggered by Cherenkov photons emitted by the e\u00b1 . The probability that a\ncertain energy Ei is ascribed to an event i where the e\u00b1 has the energy Ee depends in\nprinciple on the geometry and the details of the detector. For our purposes it is enough to\ntake into account the Poissonian nature of the emission and detection of the Cherenkov\nphotons. In this case the probability distribution function that the energy Ei is ascribed\nto an e\u00b1 with energy Ee is a Gaussian distribution,\n1\n(Ee \u2212 Ei )2\nG(Ei , Ee ) = \u221a\nexp \u2212\n2\u03c3 2 (Ee )\n2\u03c0\u03c3(Ee )\n16\n\n!\n\n(44)\n\n\fwith \u03c3(Ee ) =\n\n\u221a\n\nEe E\u03c3 , where E\u03c3 is the energy resolution. Following Refs. [44], we use\n\nE\u03c3 = 0.22 MeV for SK and E\u03c3 = 0.20 MeV for SNO. Apart from its resolution E\u03c3 , the\nother main feature of a detector is its efficiency \u01eb(E). For both experiments, we use the\napproximation \u01eb(E) = \u01eb0 \u03b8(E\u2212Ecut ) with \u01eb0 = 1 and a conservative value for Ecut = 7 MeV\nfor SK and Ecut = 5 MeV for SNO. Combining the Gaussian kernel G(Ei , Ee ) with the\ndetector efficiency \u01eb(E), the relation between the e\u00b1 energy Ee and the measured energy\nEi is\nn(Ei ) = \u01eb0\n\n\u221e\n\nZ\n\nEcut\n\ndE G(Ei , Ee )ne (Ee ) .\n\n(45)\n\nIn contrast to the two reactions considered above, the neutral-current reaction \u03bdh + d \u2192\n\u03bdh +n+p used to detect \u03bdh in SNO does not allow to measure the energy E\u03bd . Nevertheless,\n\nit is possible to reconstruct partially the \u03bdh energy spectrum comparing the observed signal\nin different detector materials with different energy responses (cf., e.g., Fig. 3 of Ref. [43]).\nAs next ingredient, we need the relation between the time\u2013integrated neutrino spectra\nni (E) and the spectra of the secondary e\u00b1 's. For the reaction \u03bd\u0304e +p \u2192 n+e+ , the positron\nspectrum is given by\n\nNp\n(46)\n\u03c3\u03bd\u0304 +p\u2192n+e+ (E + \u03bc)n\u03bd\u0304e (E + \u03bc)\n4\u03c0D 2 e\nwhere Np is the number of target protons in SK and D the distance to the supernova.\nne (Ee ) =\n\nFor the cross section, we use\n\u03c3\u03bd\u0304e +p\u2192n+e+ = \u03c30 E\n\n2\n\n\u03bc\n1\u2212\nE\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n2\u03bc \u03bc2 + m2e\n1\u2212\n+\nE\nE2\n\n!1/2\n\n(47)\n\nwith \u03c30 = 2.3 \u00d7 10\u221244 cm2 , where \u03bc = 1.227 MeV is the proton-neutron mass difference\n\nand me the electron mass. In the case of the two neutrino-deuterium reactions, we use the\n\ncross-sections tabulated in Ref. [45] and replace Np by the number of deuterium nuclei.\nNumerical simulations of the neutrino transport show that the instantaneous neutrino\nspectra can be described as Fermi-Dirac distributions with an effective degeneracy parameters \u03b7i [46, 47]. The instantaneous neutrino spectra found are pinched, i.e. their\nlow- and high-energy parts are suppressed relative to a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.\nJanka and Hillebrandt found that during the cooling process the effect of pinching becomes less important. Moreover, the pinching of the instantaneous neutrino spectra is\ncompensated by the superposition of different spectra with decreasing temperatures.\nIn the following, we assume for the time-integrated energy spectra of the different\nneutrino types\nni (E) = Ni\n\nE2\neE/Ti \u2212\u03b7i + 1\n\n17\n\n(48)\n\n\fwith hE\u03bde i = 11 MeV, hE\u03bd\u0304e i = 16 MeV and hE\u03bdh i = 25 MeV. For the degeneracy parameter, we use the values of the lower end of the range found by Janka and Hillebrandt,\nnamely \u03b7 = 3 for \u03bde , \u03b7 = 2 for \u03bd\u0304e and \u03b7 = 0 for \u03bdh . Then the relation between the effective\ntemperature Ti is given by 3T \u2248 0.751hE\u03bde i for \u03bde , 3T \u2248 0.832hE\u03bd\u0304e i for \u03bd\u0304e and 3T = hE\u03bdh i\nfor \u03bdh .\n\nWe have performed a simulation of the expected neutrino signals in SK and SNO in the\ncase of a galactic Supernova. Here have assumed g11 \u2248 g22 \u2248 g33 , as suggested by a scheme\n\nwith all three neutrino masses are quasi-degenerate, in the eV range [48]. Moreover, here\nwe have chosen the solar and atmospheric mixing angles to be maximal [49]. The resulting\naverage neutrino signals disregarding neutrino oscillations are shown for several values of\ng11 in Fig. 4 and 5. As one could expect from the discussion in Section 3.3.1, for the chosen\nvalues of g neutrino decays do not influence drastically the \u03bd\u0304e signal (Fig. 4). In contrast\nthe \u03bdh signal shown in Fig. 5 shows two main features. First, in the presence of majoron\ninteractions, the spectra show a surplus of low-energy (E <\n\u223c 18 MeV) and a deficit of\n\nhigh-energy (E >\n\u223c 18 MeV) \u03bdh compared to the reference Standard Model spectrum with\ng = 0. One sees that the decays \u03bd\u0304h \u2192 \u03bdl + J reduce the \u03bdh fluence by at most a factor\n2. Since the decays \u03bd\u0304h \u2192 \u03bdl + J and the majoron decays J \u2192 \u03bd + \u03bd \u2032 both produce also\nlow-energy \u03bd\u03c4,\u03bc , the \u03bdh signal shows a surplus of events at low energies.\n\nWe have not shown the \u03bde spectra because they are basically unchanged with respect\nto the reference spectrum with g = 0. Since the \u03bde energy sphere at RE,\u03bde is located at a\nmuch smaller density than those of \u03bd\u0304e and \u03bdh , most (\u223c 95%) \u03bd\u0304e and \u03bdh decay inside RE,\u03bde\nwhere the \u03bde are still in chemical equilibrium. Therefore, its spectrum is hardly affected\nby \u03bd\u0304e and \u03bdh decays.\nFinally, we want to comment on the dependence of our results on the assumed astrophysical parameters. First note that, an overall suppression of all three neutrino signals\ncould be explained more naturally by an astrophysical reason than by neutrino decays.\nSimilarly if a suppression with respect to the expectations of a given SN model were observed only in the \u03bdh signal, this would indicate an astrophysical explanation, since the\n\u03bdh temperature has the largest uncertainty. It is therefore of importance that part of the\nspectral information of the \u03bdh signal can be recovered by comparing the signal in different\ndetector materials. The signature for majoron neutrino decays would be two-fold. First,\na reduction of the observed \u03bdh fluence compared to the one expected from the observed\n\u03bdh temperature. Second, a non-thermal \u03bdh spectrum with a surplus of low-energy and a\ndeficit of high-energy \u03bdh .\n18\n\n\fA more quantitative study of the restrictions on the majoron\u2013neutrino couplings attainable at SK and SNO would require a detailed likelihood analysis. However, from Fig. 5\n\u22125\none expects that the sensitivity of these experiments will be restricted to g <\n\u223c 5 \u00d7 10 .\n\nTherefore, we conclude that although these experiments could narrow down the allowed\nwindow for majoron\u2013neutrino interactions, but not close it completely.\n\n4\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have reconsidered the influence of majoron neutrino decays on the neutrino signal\nof supernovae in the full range of allowed neutrino masses, in the light of recent Super\u2013\nKamiokande data on solar and atmospheric neutrinos. In the high\u2013density supernova\nmedium the effects of Majoron\u2013emitting neutrino decays are important even if they are\nsuppressed in vacuo by small neutrino masses and/or off-diagonal couplings. In contrast\nto previous works, we have considered scattering and decay processes, taking into account\nmedium effects for both kinds of processes. The dispersive effects of the dense SN core\nare particularly important since the currently favoured interpretation of the solar and\natmospheric neutrino data points towards light neutrinos.\nThe observation of SN 1987A excludes two parts of the possible range of neutrino\n\u22125\nmajoron coupling constants. In the range 3 \u00d7 10\u22127 <\n\u223c 2 \u00d7 10 , where g is the largest\n\u223cg<\n\nelement of the coupling matrix g\u03b1\u03b2 , the supernova looses to much energy into majorons,\nthereby shortening the neutrino signal too much. For larger couplings, the fluence of\nescaping \u03bd\u0304e is reduced due to decays \u03bd\u0304e \u2192 \u03bdl + J. Depending on which is the correct\n\n2\nsolution to the solar neutrino problem, different values of geff can be excluded: gee\n+\n2 >\n\u22127\n\u22124\ngeh \u223c 1 \u00d7 10 for SMA-MSW (Fig. 1) and g11 >\n\u223c 1 \u00d7 10 for LMA-MSW (Fig. 2). In the\n\ncase of vacuum oscillations, the predicted number of \u03bd\u0304e events is already disfavored (even\n\nin the absence of decays) by the observed number of events and by the current theoretical\nunderstanding of supernova explosions. The corresponding sensitivities are displayed in\nFig. 3.\nFinally, we have discussed the potential of Superkamiokande and the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory to detect majoron neutrino interactions in the case of a future galactic\nsupernova. We have found that although these experiments could narrow down the allowed window for majoron\u2013neutrino interactions, but not close it completely, reaching a\nsensitivity at the few \u00d710\u22125 level, as seen from Fig. 5.\n19\n\n\fAcknowledgements\nWe are grateful to J.F.
