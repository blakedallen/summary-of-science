The observations were made as part of the Early Release Observation (ERO)\nprogram for the newly installed ACS during service mission SM3B for the Hubble Space Telescope (HST ). Many\nyoung star clusters can be identified in the tails of UGC 10214, with ages ranging from \u223c 3 Myr to 10 Myr. The\nextreme blue V \u2212 I (F606W\u2212F814W) colors of the star clusters found in the tail of UGC 10214 can only be explained if strong emission lines are included with a young stellar population. This has been confirmed by our Keck\nspectroscopy of some of these bright blue stellar knots. The most luminous and largest of these blue knots has\nan absolute magnitude of MV = \u221214.45, with a half-light radius of 161 pc, and if it is a single star cluster, would\nqualify as a super star cluster (SSC). Alternatively, it could be a superposition of multiple scaled OB associations\nor clusters. With an estimated age of \u223c 4-5 Myr, its derived mass is < 1.3 \u00d7106 M\u2299 . Thus the young stellar knot\nis unbound and will not evolve into a normal globular cluster. The bright blue clusters and associations are much\nyounger than the dynamical age of the tail, providing strong evidence that star formation occurs in the tail long\nafter it was ejected.

Analysis of the numerous faint galaxies\nvisible in the background field will also be presented in a separate paper (Ben\u00edtez et al. 2002). The redshift of UGC 10214 is\nz = 0.03136 (Briggs et al. 2001), placing it at a distance of 125\nMpc (Ho = 75 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 ). At this distance, 1\u2032\u2032 corresponds\nto 606 pc, and 1 WFC pixel covers 30.3 pc.\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nIn 2002 April, as part of the early release observations\n(EROs) to demonstrate the new capabilities of the Advanced\nCamera for Surveys (ACS; Ford et al. 1998) installed in early\nMarch 2002 on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST ), deep images of the interacting galaxies NGC 4676 (\"The Mice\") and\nUGC 10214 (\"Tadpole\" = VV 29 = Arp 188) were obtained, using the Wide Field Channel (WFC) with the F475W (g), F606W\n(broad V ) and F814W (I) filters. NGC 4676 is a pair of galaxies caught in the act of a collision, while UGC 10214 appears\nas a disturbed spiral with a long tail of stars. In this paper, we\npresent the observations, and focus on the search and identification of very young star clusters found in the long tidal tail of\none of these galaxies, UGC 10214. In addition, we present optical spectroscopy of some of these brightest clusters obtained\nwith the Keck 10m telescope.

OBSERVATIONS AND REDUCTION\n\n2.1. ACS Imaging\nThe initial ACS observations of UGC 10214, dubbed the\nTadpole, were obtained on 2002 April 1 (UT), using the\nACS/WFC through the F475W (g), F606W (broad V ) and\nF814W (I) filters. We used POS TARG command offsets of\n3\u2032\u2032 in the Y direction to bridge the gap between the two WFC\nchips. In order to minimize the visibility of the gap, for each\nfilter, we commanded the telescope offsets to three pointings, at\n(0\u2032\u2032 , 0\u2032\u2032 ), (0.\u2032\u2032 248, 3.\u2032\u2032 001) and (\u22120.\u2032\u2032 248, \u22123.\u2032\u2032 001).

Unfortunately, there was an error\nin the telescope pointing for the first set of observations, which\ncaused part of the \"head\" of the Tadpole to get cut off from the\nfield of view. A second set of observations were subsequently\nobtained on 2002 April 9, using the identical settings and sequence of exposures as the first, but with a slight change in the\nposition and telescope orientation to include the entire head and\nbody of the \"Tadpole\" in the full WFC field of view. The total\nexposure times for the sum of both sets of observations were\n13,600s (6 orbits) in F475W, 8,040s (4 orbits) in F606W, and\n8,180s (4 orbits) in F814W.\nThe data were reduced by first calibrating with CALACS,\nwhich included bias and dark subtraction, flat fielding, and cosmic ray rejection, then processed through the ACS Investigation\nDefinition Team pipeline at Johns Hopkins University, which\nmeasured offsets and rotations between individual dithered images from both datasets and combined them while removing\ngeometric distortion, residual cosmic rays and detector defects.\nWe used the best reference files available at the time of reduction. The reader is referred to the ACS Data Handbook (Mack\net al. 2002) for details.\nIdentification of point-like objects (stars and clusters) and\ntheir photometry were performed using DAOPHOT with an\naperture radius of 3 pixels (0.\u2032\u2032 15) and sky background between\n10-15 pixels. Since the size of a WFC pixel (30.3 pc) is much\nlarger than the typical effective radius of young blue clusters\nfound in nearby galaxies (Larsen 1999), the majority of the\ncompact clusters identified in our image are not resolved. The\naperture correction was therefore calculated by measuring the\nencircled energy profiles for three isolated stars in the field. The\ncorrections applied were: 0.11 (F475W), 0.14 (F606W) and\n0.17 (F814W). All magnitudes are in AB system with the following zero points: 25.87 (F475W), 26.36 (F606W) and 25.86\n(F814W). No correction for Galactic extinction was performed,\nas it is negligible. We used the following selection criteria to\nidentify the cluster candidates: i) cluster must be present in all\nthree bands, ii) FWHM > 1 pixel in all 3 bands, iii) MV < \u22129.0,\nto exclude stars, and iv) magnitude error < 0.3 in all three\nbands.\n2.2. Keck Spectroscopy\nLong-slit spectra were obtained on 2002 May 11 with the\nEchellette Spectrograph and Imager (ESI, Sheinis et al. 2002)\non the Keck II telescope using the multiorder echellette mode\nwith an 1\u2032\u2032 wide slit. The slit was centered on a cluster or\n\"knot\" of bright blue stars in the tail of UGC 10214 [RA=16\n06 15.16, Dec= +55 25 48.74 (2000)], and oriented at PA =\n70\u25e6 along the elongation of the blue knot to include a trail of\nnearby clumps of stars (see Fig. 1). A single 900s exposure was\nobtained through variable clouds, giving a wavelength coverage\nfrom 3900 \u00c5 to 11000 \u00c5, with a two pixel spectral resolution\nof \u223c 55 km s\u22121 (FWHM). The data were reduced using standard\nIRAF tasks.\n3. RESULTS\n\nFigure 1 shows a color image of UGC 10214 and a close-up\nof the bright extended stellar association found in the tail of the\ngalaxy. We identified a total of 42 cluster candidates in this region of the tail; their F475W \u2212 F606W (g \u2212 V ) vs. F606W \u2212\nF814W (V \u2212 I) color-color diagram is shown in Figure 2.

The arrow marks the brightest stellar knot\n(red arrow in Fig. 1), which has an absolute magnitude of MV = \u221214.45 and\nqualifies as a super star cluster (SSC). The extreme blue V \u2212 I color of this and\nother clusters cannot be explained by the stellar population alone, but is due\ninstead to the presence of strong emission lines.\n\nthey cover a wider range in V \u2212 I, from zero to \u2248 2.0.\nThe brightest stellar knot (marked by an arrow in Fig. 1)\nof the extended blue clump is very blue (V \u2212 I = \u22121.18, g \u2212 V\n= \u22120.05), and has apparent AB magnitudes of F475W (g) =\n21.07, F606W (V ) = 21.12, F814W (I) = 22.30. With an absolute magnitude of MV = \u221214.45, it is most likely a very young\nmassive super star cluster (SSC). The combination of the moderate g \u2212 V color but extremely blue V \u2212 I color cannot be explained by the usual population synthesis models of Bruzual &\nCharlot (2001, hereafter BC01) or Starburst99 models of Leitherer et al. (1999, hereafter SB99), even for stars as young as\n1 Myr (see Fig. 2). The simplest way that these colors could be\nfitted is to include strong emission lines in the starburst models\nof BC01 and SB99. The alteration of colors of young compact star clusters due to the presence of strong emission lines\nhas been recognized for some time, as discussed in e.g., MasHesse & Kunth (1991), Mayya (1995), Stiavelli et al. (1998)\nand Whitmore & Zhang (2002), among others.\nShown in Figure 3 are the model spectrum of such a cluster.\nThe model was constructed from a combination of the stellar\ncontinuum of BC01 and the strongest and most common emission lines, whose strengths were derived based on the H\u03b2 equivalent width versus age relationship of SB99, and assuming typical line ratios for a starburst region. Also plotted in the figure\nare the filter bandpasses for the three filters used in the observation. As can be seen, for the redshift of UGC 10214, the F606W\nfilter would allow all of the strongest emission lines through,\nwhile they are all excluded from the F814W filter. On the other\nhand, the strong emission lines of [O III] \u03bb\u03bb4959, 5007, but not\nthe H\u03b1 + [N II] complex, are allowed through the F475W filter.\n\n\fUGC 10214 Star Clusters\n\n3\n\nF IG . 1.- Composite g, V , and I color image of UGC 10214, with a close-up of the bright blue clump in the tail. The brightest stellar knot marked by the red\narrow is a probable super star cluster (SSC). Parallel lines indicate the slit width and orientation used in the Keck spectroscopy.\n\nThis results in a V \u2212 I (F606W\u2212F814W) color that is too blue\ncompared to a stellar continuum from a pure (i.e., no emission\nline) population synthesis model, but a g \u2212V (F475W\u2212F606W)\ncolor that is not unusual. This clearly demonstrates that the\naddition of emission lines could naturally explain the extreme\nV \u2212 I observed color, while the g \u2212 V color remained relatively\n\nunchanged.\nThe color-color evolutionary tracks derived from the model\ndescribed above is shown in Figure 2. As can be seen, the model\nwith emission lines (dashed curve) appears to fit better with the\nobserved data points than that without (solid curve). Most of\nthe candidate clusters lie close to and slightly below the\n\n\f4\n\nTran et al.\n1998), yielding an estimate of 1-6 Myr, consistent with the age\nobtained from population synthesis model fits to ACS photometry. Due to the faintness of the continuum and the non-optimum\nobserving conditions, the S/N is insufficient to allow a search\nfor W-R features, such as the 4686\u00c5 bump, which is expected\nfor a young star cluster of this age. Better quality spectra would\nbe needed to confirm the existence of W-R stars and constrain\nthe star formation history of the cluster.\n4. DISCUSSION\n\nF IG . 3.- Model optical spectrum of the SSC in the tail of UGC 10214.\nOverlaid are the transmission curves of the three filters used. At the redshift of\nUGC 10214, most strong emission lines are able to pass through both F475W\nand F606W filters, while none is allowed through F814W.\n\nmodeled track, and are consistent with ages in the range 3-10\nMyr. The slightly redder g\u2212V color of most of the older clusters\ncompared to the modeled curve could be explained by a small\namount of extinction. From a comparison with the model, the\nbest age estimate for the SSC is about 4-5 Myr.\nBased on these findings, in May 2002 we obtained Keck\nspectroscopy of the blue knot (see \u00a72.2) in order to test the\nfollowing: i) confirm the presence of strong emission lines as\nrequired by the models. ii) look for the expected signatures of\nWolf-Rayet (W-R) stars which descended from the very massive O stars (& 30 M\u2299 ) in the cluster, and iii) better constrain\nthe spectral energy distribution (SED) of the star cluster and test\nthe theoretical models of BC01 and SB99.\nA Keck spectrum of the brightest blue knot is shown in\nFigure 4. As predicted, very strong emission lines are seen.\nThese lines include those of H\u03b2, H\u03b1, [O III] \u03bb\u03bb4959, 5007,\n[N II] \u03bb\u03bb6548, 6583, and [S II] \u03bb\u03bb6717, 6731. The heliocentric velocity measured from these lines is 9422 \u00b1 7 km s\u22121 .\nThis is consistent with the HI velocity measured by Briggs et\nal. (2001) at the position of this knot. The emission line widths\nare very narrow, but may be slightly resolved in our spectra.\nThe observed FWHM is \u2248 75 km s\u22121 , giving an instrumentalcorrected (subtraction in quadrature) width of \u223c 50 km s\u22121 . The\nobserved Balmer decrement H\u03b1/H\u03b2 is 2.76, indicating very little or no reddening toward the tail of UGC 10214 at the position of this blue knot. Other line ratios are: [O III] \u03bb5007/H\u03b2 =\n5.53, [N II] \u03bb6583/H\u03b1 =0.0705, [S II] (6717 + 6731)/H\u03b1 =\n0.090, [O I] \u03bb6300/H\u03b1 = 0.012, [O III] (5007 + 4959)/4363\n= 86, and [S II] 6717/6731 = 1.35. These emission-line ratios\nyield an electron temperature of about 1.36 \u00d7104 K and density\nof 60 cm\u22123 , fairly typical of photoionized gas in metal-poor H II\nregions. They also place them among areas typically occupied\nby H II regions and H II galaxies in the diagnostic diagrams of\nVeilleux & Osterbrock (1987).\nThe observed optical continuum is very faint and barely detectable. This results in a very uncertain determination of the\nequivalent width (EW) of the H\u03b2 emission line. We measure\nan H\u03b2 EW of 290 \u00b1 255 \u00c5, the error for which is dominated\nby that of the continuum level. In principle, this can be used to\nconstrain the age of the star cluster (SB99; Schaerer & Vacca\n\nIt is of interest to ask if the large knots or clumps of blue stars\nfound in the tail of UGC 10214 were created from the galactic\nencounter and whether they are precursors to the compact globular clusters (GC) that are found in our Galaxy and essentially\nall galactic halos. These star clusters are similar to those found\nin the tidal debris of the Antennae Galaxies (NGC 4038/4039,\ne.g., Whitmore et al. 1999) or of the Stephan's Quintet (NGC\n7318/7319, Gallagher et al. 2001).\nWe can estimate the mass of the brightest blue stellar \"knot\",\nor SSC in the tail of UGC 10214 from its estimated age and observed brightness by using an existing relationship between age\nand mass-to-light ratio (M/L) for young stellar clusters derived\nby Chandar et al. (1999) using Padua models (Chiosi, Vallenari,\n& Bressan 1997). With a derived age of \u223c 4-5 Myr, the correlation gives log M/LV = \u22121.6. The observed absolute magnitude\nfor the SSC in F606W is \u221214.45 or LV = 107.7 L\u2299 , yielding an\nestimated mass of 1.3 \u00d7106 M\u2299 . We note that this actually represents an upper limit of the mass since the modeled M/L does\nnot include contribution from emission lines. To correct for the\nemission-line contribution, we compared the integrated flux of\nour modeled spectrum with and without emission lines through\nthe F606W filter. The difference in cluster brightness is found\nto be 0.75 mag in F606W, giving a corrected (line-free) absolute magnitude of \u221213.70 or LV = 107.42 L\u2299 , and reducing the\nmass to 6.6 \u00d7105 M\u2299 . These values are typical for a SSC. In\nparticular, the luminosity and mass of this SSC are similar to\nthose of the \u223c 60 Myr old SSC \"F\" in M82 (Smith & Gallagher\n2001), or of the 15 Myr old SSC \"1447\" in NGC 6946 (Larsen\net al. 2001).\nThe 3 to 10 Myr ages of the clusters in the tidal tail show\nthat they formed close to their present positions. The projected\ndistance of the \u223c 4.5 Myr old SSC is 61 kpc from the center\nof UGC 10214. Assuming that the maximum ejection velocity\navailable to the cluster is comparable to the 400 km s\u22121 rotation\nspeed measured by Briggs et al. (2001) for the main galaxy, the\ndynamical age for the tail is at least 150 Myr old. Since this\nis much older than the estimated age of the SSC, we conclude\nthat the young clusters in the tail formed long after the galactic encounter that produced the tidal debris. This conclusion\nis consistent with the mechanism proposed by Wallin (1990),\nwho suggested that star formation was triggered in the tail by\ndensity enhancements produced from tidal forces in the collision. It is also consistent with the suggestion by Hibbard & van\nGorkom (1996) that \"gaps\" (region of reduced surface brightness) in tidal tails are induced by self-gravity in the tails. The\ntwo most prominent regions of star formation in UGC 10214\ntail are separated by the most conspicuous gap in the tail. In\nsitu star formation in tidal tails has also been observed in many\nother systems (e.g., Schweizer 1978; Mirabel, Dottori, & Lutz\n1992), and appears to be a common feature of such tails.\nFitting the surface brightness profiles of the SSC with a king\nmodel (King 1962) gives a core radius of about 0.\u2032\u2032 155, or 94\n\n\fUGC 10214 Star Clusters\n\n5\n\nF IG . 4.- Keck observed ESI spectrum of the brightest blue stellar knot (SSC) in the tail of UGC 10214. Strong H\u03b2 and [O III] \u03bb\u03bb4959, 5007 emission lines are\nseen to the left around 5100 \u00c5, and H\u03b1+[N II] complex is at near 6750 \u00c5.\n\npc, corresponding to a half light radius of re = 0.\u2032\u2032 266 = 161\npc. To our knowledge, the largest re measured for a SSC or a\nscaled OB association (SOBA) is 84 pc (Ma\u00edz-Apell\u00e1niz 2001).\nAs a comparison, the F-M82 SSC, which has similar mass and\nluminosity, has a half light radius of 2.8 pc. Therefore, the unusually large size of the SSC in UGC 10214 suggests that this\ncluster could be a particularly populous OB association or an\nunresolved superposition of a multiple system like that in NGC\n1569 A1-A2 (De Marchi et al. 1997). In contrast to the case\nof 30 Doradus Nebula, which has a very large emission-line region but the stellar component is largely confined to the very\ncompact R136 star cluster (Walborn, Ma\u00edz-Apell\u00e1niz, & Barb\u00e1\n2002), we can rule out the possibility of a similar significant\nnebula contribution to the large size of the UGC 10214 SSC.\nThe UGC 10214 cluster radius measured from the F814W data,\nwhere stellar continuum dominates, is not significantly different\nfrom those measured from the F475W and F606W data, where\nline emission dominates. Thus, the measured size of the SSC\nin UGC 10214 can be taken as genuinely due mostly to stars.\nThe above estimated mass of the SSC (6.6 \u00d7105 M\u2299 ) is\n\u2248 3 \u00d7 the mass of a typical globular cluster (GC; Mandushev,\nSpassova, & Staneva 1991), while its radius is approximately\n50 \u00d7 the size of a GC. This corresponds to a mass density\nthat is at least 4 orders of magnitude smaller than that of a\nGC. Assuming that the projected half-mass radius rm = 4/3 re\n\n(Spitzer 1987), the mass density within the half-mass radius is\nonly \u223c 10\u22122 M\u2299 pc\u22123 . Thus, under the assumption that the SSC\nrepresents a single cluster of young stars, it appears to be quite\n\"fluffy\" for its mass. For an isotropic, gravitationally bound\nsystem, the total cluster mass is given by the virial theorem:\nM = 3\u03c3 2 R/G, where \u03c3 is the line-of-sight velocity dispersion\nand R is the effective radius. Therefore, to remain bound like a\nGC, \u03c3 for the blue SSC has to be . 1/4 \u00d7 \u03c3GC . The velocity dispersion of a Galactic GC is typically less than 20 km s\u22121 , with\na mean of \u03c3GC = 8.4 km s\u22121 (Mandushev et al. 1991), which\nmeans that the stellar velocities in the SSC cannot be greater\nthan \u223c 5 km s\u22121 , if it is to remain bound. This cannot be the\ncase, if the stars move about like the gas (\u223c 50 km s\u22121 , \u00a73) in\nthe cluster. Thus the blue clump in the tail of UGC 10214 is\nunlikely grow up to be a GC, unless it is dynamically very cold.\nBecause we do not know the distribution of mass in UGC\n10214's halo and the geometry of the tidal tail, it is difficult to\nsay whether or not the stars and gas in the tail are gravitationally\nbound to the parent galaxy. Briggs et al. (2001) found that the\nHI velocities in the tail are only \u223c100 km s\u22121 higher than the HI\nsystemic velocity of UGC 10214, with little or no velocity gradient over the 100 kpc length of the tail. They also revealed a\npossible counter tail on the western side of the main galaxy with\nan approaching velocity of \u223c 300 km s\u22121 . Such tail kinematics\nare like those of other mergers sporting similarly long tidal tails\n\n\f6\n\nTran et al.\n\n(e.g., NGC 7252, Hibbard & Mihos 1995; Arp 299, Hibbard &\nYun 1999). Numerical simulations of NGC 7252 (Hibbard &\nMihos 1995) have indicated that most of the tail material will\nremain bound, falling back towards the merger remnant over\nseveral billion years, perhaps forming rings, shells and highvelocity streams. Similar detailed modeling for UGC 10214\nshould be very valuable in accounting for its tidal morphology\nand tail kinematics, and predicting their future evolution, but\nit seems likely that the stars and gas will remain bound in the\npoor cluster WBL 608 (White et al. 1999) to which UGC 10214\nbelongs. UGC 10214 and galaxies like it provide nearby examples of processes that contributed to the formation of halos and\nintra-cluster media in the distant and younger Universe, when\nthe density of galaxies was higher.\n5. CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe obtained ACS WFC observations of the peculiar merging galaxy UGC 10214, and presented Keck optical spectra of\na luminous, young blue stellar clump located in the tail of the\ngalaxy. The unusually blue V \u2212 I color but normal g \u2212 V color\nof the clump can be well explained by the presence of strong\n\nemission lines characteristic of H II regions embedded in a super cluster of massive, young stars. Population synthesis models indicate the age of the star cluster to be \u223c 4-5 Myr. The\nlarge size of the cluster, combined with its moderate estimated\nmass of M \u223c 6.6 \u00d7 105 M\u2299 suggest that its mass density is too\nlow to allow it to evolve into a normal globular cluster. The\nbright blue clusters and associations lie at large projected distances, with an age much younger than that of the tail, providing\nstrong evidence that star formation occurs in the tail long after\nit was ejected.\nACS was developed under NASA contract NAS5-32864, and\nthis research is supported by NASA grant NAG5-7697.
