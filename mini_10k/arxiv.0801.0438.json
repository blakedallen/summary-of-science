Motivated by results of J.E.\nMcCarthy and M. Putinar, we define a family of weighted CauchyFantappi\u00e8 pairings on the ball and establish duality relations between certain pairs of classes, and in particular we identify the\ndual of the positive Schur class. We also establish the existence\nof self-dual classes with respect to this pairing, and identify some\nextreme points of the positive Schur class.\n\n1. Introduction\nIt is well-known that a function f , holomorphic in the unit disk D,\nhas nonnegative real part if and only if there exists a finite, positive\nBorel measure \u03bc on the unit circle T such that\nZ\n1 + z\u03b6\nd\u03bc(\u03b6) + iIf (0).\n(1.1)\nf (z) =\nT 1 \u2212 z\u03b6\n\nThis expression is called the Herglotz representation of f . No such\nsimple characterization is available in higher dimensions. One may\nconsider the class M + , consisting of all functions on the unit ball Bd \u2282\nCd of the form\nZ\n1 + hz, \u03b6i\nf (z) =\nd\u03bc(\u03b6) + iIf (0)\n\u2202Bd 1 \u2212 hz, \u03b6i\n\nwhere \u03bc is a positive measure on \u2202Bd , but this does not exhaust the\nclass of holomorphic functions of positive real part. The present paper\nexamines several subclasses of functions of positive real part in Bd ,\nwhich are shown to admit what one might call a \"noncommutative\nHerglotz representation;\" that is, a representation where the integral\nof the Herglotz kernel against a measure is replaced by the value of\nDate: November 6, 2018.\nPartially supported by NSF grant DMS-0701268.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nMICHAEL T. JURY\n\nan operator-valued Herglotz kernel (taking values in a C*-algebra A)\nunder a positive functional on the C*-algebra.\nIndeed a result of this form (though not stated in quite these terms)\nwas established by McCarthy and Putinar [6] for functions in the positive Schur class S + , which consists of all holomorphic functions f on\nBd for which the Hermitian kernel\nf (z) + f (w)\n1 \u2212 hz, wi\nis positive semidefinite. In the noncommutative Herglotz formula for\nS + , the algebra C(\u2202Bd ) of continuous functions on \u2202Bd is replaced by\nthe Cuntz algebra Od , which is the universal C*-algebra generated by\na family of isometries V1 , . . . Vd satisfying the relations\nVi\u2217 Vj\n\n= \u03b4ij ,\n\nd\nX\n\nVj Vj\u2217 = I.\n\nj=1\n\nThe Herglotz kernel is replaced by the Od -valued holomorphic function\nH(z, V ) = 2(I \u2212\n\nd\nX\nj=1\n\nzj Vj )\u22121 \u2212 I.\n\nWe then have the following theorem:\nTheorem 1.1 ([6]). Let f be holomorphic in Bd . Then f \u2208 S + if\nand only if there exists a positive linear functional \u03c1 on Od and a real\nnumber t such that\n(1.2)\n\nf (z) = \u03c1(H(z, V )) + it.\n\nLetting O + denote the class of all holomorphic functions with positive real part in Bd , McCarthy and Putinar established the inclusions\nM + \u2282 S + \u2282 O+\nand showed that each is proper. They also introduced a pairing on\nO + such that M + and O + are dual to each other, and the dual of S +\nis contained in S + . The main results of this paper continue this line\nof investigation: we introduce a fourth class R+ which is shown to lie\nstrictly between M + and S + , and show that R+ and S + are dual (under\na slightly different definition of the pairing, which has more favorable\ntopological properties). We also establish an operator-valued Herglotz\nrepresentation for R+ and describe some of the extreme rays of R+ and\nS +.\n\n\f3\n\n2. Positive Classes\nLet O denote the set of all holomorphic functions on the unit ball\nB \u2282 Cd , and O + \u2282 O the functions of positive real part. We equip\nO with the topology of uniform convergence on compact subsets of Bd ,\nwhich makes O into a locally convex topological vector space. We will\nbe interested in several subclasses of O + which all satisfy a number of\nfunctional-analytic conditions, codified by the following definition.\nd\n\nDefinition 2.1. A positive class on Bd is a set of functions P \u2282 O +\nwhich is a closed, convex cone in O and is closed under dilations, that\nis, if f \u2208 P then fr \u2208 P for all 0 \u2264 r \u2264 1, where fr is defined by\nfr (z) = f (rz)\nEvidently O + is a positive class; we will discuss further examples\nbelow (the classes M + , R+ and S + ). It is also clear that the intersection\nof any collection of positive classes is a positive class, so given any\nsubset E \u2282 O + we may speak of the positive class P(E) it generates.\nWe introduce a family of Cauchy-Fantappi\u00e8 pairings analogous to\nthe classical Cauchy pairing in the disk. In the case of the disk, if\nthe functions are sufficiently smooth then the pairing is essentially the\ninner product in the Hilbert space H 2 . The analogous Hilbert space on\nBd is the Drury-Arveson space Hd2 , which is most easily defined as the\nreproducing kernel Hilbert space whose kernel is the Fantappi\u00e8 kernel\nX\n1\n|\u03b1|!\nk(z, w) =\n=\nz\u03b1 w\u03b1\n1 \u2212 hz, wi\n\u03b1!\n\u03b1\nHere we have used the usual multi-index notation:\n\u03b1 = (\u03b11 , . . . \u03b1d ) \u2208 Nd ,\n\u03b1! = \u03b11 !\u03b12 ! * * * \u03b1d !,\n|\u03b1| = \u03b11 + * * * + \u03b1d ,\nz \u03b1 = z1\u03b11 * * * zd\u03b1d .\n\nFor functions f, g \u2208 Hd2 with Taylor expansions\nX\nX\nf (z) =\nc\u03b1 z \u03b1 ,\ng(z) =\nd\u03b1 z \u03b1\n\u03b1\u2208Nd\n\n\u03b1\u2208Nd\n\nthe inner product is given by\n(2.1)\n\nhf, giHd2 =\n\nX\n\u03b1\n\nc\u03b1 d \u03b1\n\n\u03b1!\n|\u03b1|!\n\n\f4\n\nMICHAEL T. JURY\n\nWe may also express the inner product in an integral formula [1]. To\nstate in we let Rd denote the radial derivative:\n(Rd f )(z) :=\n\nd\nX\nj=1\n\nThen\n(2.2)\n\nhf, giHd2\n\n1\n= f (0)g(0) +\nd!\n\nZ\n\nzj\n\n\u2202f\n\u2202zj\n\n(Rd f )(z)g(z)\n\nBd\n\n1\nd\u03bd(z)\n|z|2d\n\nwhere \u03bd is normalized volume measure on Bd . Note that the singularity\nin the integrand of (2.2) is integrable near 0, since\n|(Rd f )(z)| \u2264 |z|kDf (z)k.\n\nNow define a family of pairings Qr (*, *) on O as follows: given function\nf, g \u2208 O with Taylor expansions\nX\nX\nf (z) =\nc\u03b1 z \u03b1 ,\ng(z) =\nd\u03b1 z \u03b1\n\u03b1\u2208Nd\n\n\u03b1\u2208Nd\n\ndefine for each 0 < r < 1\n(2.3)\n\nQr (f, g) =\n\nX\n\nc\u03b1 d \u03b1 r \u03b1\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b1!\n+ f (0)g(0)\n|\u03b1|!\n\nLemma 2.2. The series defining Qr (f, g) converges absolutely for all\nf, g \u2208 O and all r \u2208 [0, 1).\nProof. Since the pairing Qr (f, g) is formally the same (up to the extra\nf (0)g(0) term) as the Hd2 inner product of the dilated functions f\u221ar and\ng\u221ar , by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality it suffices to show that if f \u2208 O\nthen all of its dilates fr belong to Hd2 . But this is immediate from the\nintegral form of the Hd2 inner product (2.2), since fr is analytic across\nthe boundary \u2202Bd and so fr and its derivatives are uniformly bounded\n\u0003\non Bd .\nOur interest is in the duality relationships that obtain between positive classes that admit representations by a generalized Herglotz formula, more specifically, in terms of a positive functional applied to an\noperator-valued Herglotz kernel, taking values in a (generally noncommutative) C*-algebra. Using the pairings Qr we can define the dual of\na subset C \u2282 O:\nDefinition 2.3. For C \u2282 O define\n\nC \u2217 = {g \u2208 O | RQr (f, g) \u2265 0 for all f \u2208 C and all r \u2208 [0, 1)}\n\n\f5\n\nThis is slightly different from the dual C \u2020 defined in [6]; the advantage\nof the present definition is that duals of (sufficiently large) positive\nclasses are again positive classes; in particular they are always closed\nand convex.\nWe will write Q(f, g) for the pairing in the case r = 1, provided the\nseries is absolutely convergent. From the proof of Lemma 2.2, this will\nbe the case whenever either f or g is holomorphic in a neighborhood\nof the closed ball. In particular, every continuous linear functional on\nO can be represented in this way:\nTheorem 2.4. A linear map \u03c6 : O \u2192 C is continuous if and only if\nthere exists g \u2208 O(Bd ) such that\n\u03c6(f ) = Q(f, g)\n\nfor all f \u2208 O.\nProof. To prove that each Q(*, g) induces a continuous linear functional, it suffices to prove continuity at 0. Since g is holomorphic in a\nneighborhood of Bd , we can choose r < 1 so that the dilate g 1 is still\nr\n\nholomorphic in a neighborhood of Bd . We may then write\nQ(f, g) = Q(fr , g 1 )\nr\n\nfor all f \u2208 O. If now fn is any sequence of functions tending to 0\nuniformly on compact sets, for each r < 1 the dilates (fn )r converge\nto 0 uniformly on a neighborhood of Bd . It follows that this sequence\nalso converges to 0 in Hd2 . We then have by Cauchy-Schwarz\n|Q(fn , g)| \u2264 |fn (0)g(0)| + |h(fn )r , g 1 iHd2 |\nr\n\n\u2264 |fn (0)g(0)| + k(fn )r kHd2 kg 1 kHd2\nr\n\nwhich converges to 0 as n \u2192 \u221e.\nFor the converse, let \u03c6 be a continuous linear functional on O. Let\nC = C(Bd ) be the space of continuous functions on Bd equipped with\nthe topology of local uniform convergence. The dual of C is the space of\nfinite Borel measures with compact support in Bd . Since O is closed in\nC, by Hahn-Banach \u03c6 extends to a continuous functional on C. Thus\nthere exists a measure with compact support K \u2282 Bd such that\nZ\n\u03c6(f ) =\nf d\u03bc\nK\n\nfor all f \u2208 O. Now define a function g \u2208 O by\nZ\n1\n1 + hz, wi\n(2.4)\ng(z) =\nd\u03bc(w)\n2 K 1 \u2212 hz, wi\n\n\f6\n\nMICHAEL T. JURY\n\nSince K is at positive distance from boundary \u2202Bd , g is holomorphic\nin a neighborhood of Bd . Since the power series for (1 \u2212 hz, wi)\u22121\nconverges uniformly on K, we can pass the integral inside the sum to\nobtain the power series expansion for g\nZ\nX |\u03b1|! Z\n1\ng(z) =\nd\u03bc(w) +\nz\u03b1\nw\u03b1 d\u03bc(w).\n2 K\n\u03b1!\nK\n\u03b16=0\nIt is then readily verified that\nZ\n(2.5)\n\u03c6(f ) =\nf d\u03bc = Q(f, g).\nK\n\n(Indeed, the pairing Q(*, *) is defined precisely so that (2.5) holds when\ng is of the form (2.4).)\n\u0003\nWe now introduce the positive M + , which consists of functions that\ncan be written as Herglotz transforms of positive measures on \u2202Bd :\nDefinition 2.5. f \u2208 M + if and only if there exists a finite, positive\nBorel measure \u03bc, supported on \u2202Bd , such that\nZ\n1 + hz, \u03b6i\nd\u03bc(\u03b6) + iIf (0)\nf (z) =\n\u2202Bd 1 \u2212 hz, \u03b6i\n\nUnlike in one dimension, M + is a proper subclass of O + , however we\ndo have the following duality relation (compare [6, Theorem 8.2]):\nTheorem 2.6. M +\u2217 = O + and O +\u2217 = M + .\n\nProof. By a calculation similar to that in the proof of Theorem 2.4, if\ng \u2208 M + and f \u2208 O we have\nZ\nQr (f, g) =\nfr d\u03bc\n\u2202Bd\n\nThe real part of this is positive for all \u03bc and all r < 1 if and only if\nf \u2208 O + . The opposite duality will follow from Theorem 2.7 below. \u0003\n\nTheorem 2.7. If P \u2283 M + is a positive class, then P \u2217 is a positive\nclass and P \u2217\u2217 = P.\n\nProof. Since P \u2283 M + , we have P \u2217 \u2282 O + . All of the remaining properties of a positive class now follow from the definition of the pairings\nQr .\nIt is immediate from definitions that P \u2282 P \u2217\u2217 . The reverse inclusion\nis proved by a cone separation argument. If h \u2208 P \u2217\u2217 \\ P, since P is a\nclosed, convex cone we can find a linear functional \u03c6 on O such that\nR\u03c6(f ) \u2265 0 for all f \u2208 P but R\u03c6(h) < 0. By the duality theorem\nthere exist g \u2208 O such that \u03c6(f ) = Q(f, g) for all f \u2208 O. Since P\n\n\f7\n\nis a positive class, we have Qr (f, g) = Q(fr , g) = \u03c6(fr ) for all f \u2208 P;\ntaking real parts it follows that g \u2208 P \u2217 . But then RQr (h, g) < 0 for r\nsufficiently close to 1, contradicting h \u2208 P \u2217\u2217 . Thus P \u2217\u2217 \u2282 P.\n\u0003\nTheorem 2.8. Suppose P \u2283 M + is a positive class with P \u2282 P \u2217 .\nThen there exists a positive class W such that\nP \u2282 W \u2282 P\u2217\nand W = W \u2217 .\nProof. Let U denote the collection of all positive classes W such that\nP \u2282 W \u2282 P \u2217 and W \u2282 W \u2217 . The collection U is nonempty (it contains\nP) and partially ordered by inclusion. We apply Zorn's lemma to\nobtain a maximal element: if {Wj }j\u2208J is an increasing chain in U,\ndefine W\u221e = \u222aj Wj . It is clear that W\u221e is a closed, convex cone in\nO + . Moreover, if f \u2208 W\u221e and r < 1, we have a sequence fj \u2192 f locally\nuniformly, with each fj in some Wj . Since each Wj is a positive class,\n(fj )r \u2208 Wj and (fj )r \u2192 fr , so fr \u2208 W\u221e and hence W\u221e is a positive\n\u2217\nclass. It remains to check that W\u221e \u2282 W\u221e\n. But it is straightforward\n\u2217\n\u2217\nto check that W\u221e = \u2229j Wj , and from this it follows that W\u221e belongs\nto U. Thus every increasing chain in U has an upper bound, so Zorn's\nlemma gives a maximal element W.\nTo see that W = W \u2217 , we proceed by contradiction. If f \u2208 W \u2217 \\ W,\nthen we form a new positive class Wf , the positive class generated by\nW and f . We now check that Wf \u2282 Wf\u2217 , contradicting the maximality\nof W.\nThe set of functions of the form\n\ng = g0 +\n\nn\nX\n\ncj frj\n\nj=1\n\nwith g0 \u2208 W, cj > 0 and rj \u2208 [0, 1), is dense in Wf . We check that\nRQr (g, h) \u2265 0 for all g, h \u2208 Wf of the above form; positivity for all\ng, h \u2208 Wf follows by taking limits. Letting\nh = h0 +\n\nm\nX\nk=1\n\ndk fsk\n\n\f8\n\nMICHAEL T.

Operator-valued Herglotz kernels\nA row contraction is a d-tuple of operators T = (T1 , . . . Td ) on a\nHilbert space H such that\nI \u2212 T1 T1\u2217 \u2212 * * * \u2212 Td Td\u2217 \u2265 0\n\nIf T is a row contraction and z \u2208 Bd , then the operator\nhz, T i := z1 T1 + * * * zd Td\nis a strict contraction. We may then define an operator-valued Herglotz\nkernel\nH(z, T ) : = 2(I \u2212 hz, T i)\u22121 \u2212 I\n\n= (I + hz, T i)(I \u2212 hz, T i)\u22121\n\nwhich we view as an analytic function on Bd taking values in B(H). A\nstraightforward calculation shows\nRH(z, T ) = 2(I \u2212 hz, T i)\u22121 (I \u2212 hz, T ihz, T i\u2217)(I \u2212 hz, T i\u2217 )\u22121 \u2265 0\nHence if \u03c1 is a positive linear functional on the C*-algebra generated\nby T , the holomorphic function\n(3.1)\n\nf (z) = \u03c1(H(z, T ))\n\nhas positive real part on Bd . We will call such f the Herglotz transform\nof the pair (\u03c1, T ). Theorem 1.1 characterizes the positive class S + in\nterms of Herglotz transforms.\nOne may observe that it is not really necessary to assume that T\nis a row contraction for the above calculation to be valid; rather, for\n\n\f9\n\nH(z, T ) to be well-defined (and have nonnegative real part) it is only\nnecessary that\nI \u2212 hz, T ihz, T i\u2217 \u2265 0\n\nfor all z \u2208 Bd . This is easily seen to be equivalent to the condition that\n\n(3.2)\n\nkh\u03b6, T ik \u2264 1\n\nfor all \u03b6 \u2208 \u2202Bd .\n\nIt turns out, however, that there is no loss of generality in assuming\nthat T is a row contraction. More precisely, we have:\nTheorem 3.1. If T = T1 , . . . Td is a d-tuple satisfying (3.2) and \u03c1 is a\npositive linear functional on C \u2217 (T ), then the Herglotz transform\nf (z) = \u03c1(H(z, T ))\nbelongs to S + (and is hence the Herglotz transform of a pair (\u03c3, U)\nwhere U is a row contraction).\nProof. From the definition of S + , it will suffice to prove that if T satisfies (3.2), then the operator-valued kernel\nH(z, T ) + H(w, T )\u2217\n1 \u2212 hz, wi\n\nis positive semidefinite on Bd . After some algebraic manipulations we\nfind that the positivity of this kernel is equivalent to the positivity of\nthe kernel\n1 \u2212 hz, T ihw, T i\u2217\nkT (z, w) =\n1 \u2212 hz, wi\nSuppose, then, that T1 , . . . Td are operators on a Hilbert space H and\nk\n\nd\nX\nj=1\n\n\u03b6j Tj k \u2264 1\n\nfor all \u03b6 \u2208 \u2202Bd . Thus for every unit vector \u03be \u2208 H, we find\nd X\nd\nX\ni=1 j=1\n\nhTi \u03be, Tj \u03beiH\u03b6i \u03b6j \u2264 1\n\nfor all unit vectors \u03b6 \u2208 Cd . In other words, the positive semidefinite\nd \u00d7 d matrix\nA = (aij ) = hTi \u03be, Tj \u03bei\n\nis contractive on Cd . Consider now the kernel kT ; this operator-valued\nkernel is positive semidefinite if and only if the scalar-valued kernel\nhkT (z, w)\u03be, \u03beiH\n\n\f10\n\nMICHAEL T. JURY\n\nis positive for all unit vectors \u03be \u2208 H. From the definition of the matrix\nA, this kernel is equal to\n1 \u2212 hA1/2 z, A1/2 wi\n1 \u2212 hz, wi\n\nwhich is positive since kA1/2 k \u2264 1 on Cd .\n\n\u0003\n\nThree particular row contractions (and the C*-algebras they generate) will be of interest. First, we may view the commutative C*-algebra\nC(\u2202Bd ) as the universal C*-algebra generated by a d-tuple of commuting normal elements Z = (Z1 , . . . Zd ) satisfying\nI \u2212 Z1 Z1\u2217 \u2212 * * * \u2212 Zd Zd\u2217 = 0\n\n(these are called spherical operators in [2]; one should think of these\n\"universal generators\" simply as the coordinate functions \u03b61 , . . . \u03b6d in\nC(\u2202Bd )). Second, we consider the row contraction S = (S1 , . . . Sd )\nwhere Sj is multiplication by zj on the space Hd2 . These generate the\nd-variable Toeplitz algebra Td . Finally, we have the d-tuple of Cuntz\nisometries, which are isometries with orthogonal ranges whose final\nprojections sum to I. That is, d-tuples V = (V1 , . . . Vd ) such that\nVi\u2217 Vj = \u03b4ij ,\n\nI \u2212 V1 V1\u2217 \u2212 * * * \u2212 Vd Vd\u2217 = 0.\n\nThe Cuntz C* algebra Od is the universal C*-algebra generated by the\nCuntz isometries. We now have three positive classes M + , R+ and S +\nwhich can be expressed in terms of operator-valued Herglotz formulae.\nThe classes M + and S + were described in [6].\nTheorem 3.2. Each of the following is a positive class on Bd :\n\u2022 M + , consisting of all functions of the form\nf (z) = \u03c1(H(z, Z)) + iIf (0)\n\nwhere \u03c1 is a positive linear functional on C(\u2202Bd ),\n\u2022 R+ , consisting of all functions of the form\nf (z) = \u03c1(H(z, S)) + iIf (0)\n\nwhere \u03c1 is a positive linear functional on Td ,\n\u2022 S + , consisting of all functions of the form\nf (z) = \u03c1(H(z, V )) + iIf (0)\n\nwhere \u03c1 is a positive linear functional on Od .\n\nProof. We prove that R+ is a positive class; it will be clear that an\nanalogous proof works for the others.\nIt is clear from the definition that R+ is a convex cone, since the\nset of positive functionals on a C*-algebra is a convex cone. To see\n\n\f11\n\nthat R+ is closed, let fn be a sequence in R+ converging uniformly on\ncompact sets to a function f \u2208 O + (we assume for simplicity that fn (0)\nis real for all n). Then there is a sequence of positive functionals \u03c1n on\nTd such that\nfn (z) = \u03c1n (H(z, S)).\nSince the sequence k\u03c1n k = |\u03c1n (I)| = |fn (0)| is bounded, by the BanachAlaoglu theorem \u03c1n has a weak-* cluster point \u03c1. But then we have\nf (z) = \u03c1(H(z, S))\nand hence f \u2208 R+ .\nTo prove that R+ is dilation invariant, we obtain an equivalent definition of R+ (which will also be of use later). By the Gelfand-NaimarkSegal theorem applied to the functional \u03c1, there exist a Hilbert space\nH, a vector \u03be \u2208 H and a representation \u03c0 : Td \u2192 B(H) such that\n\u03c1(H(z, S)) = hH(z, \u03c0(S))\u03be, \u03beiH\nBy Arveson's dilation theorem, we conclude that f \u2208 R+ if and only if\nthere exists a Hilbert space H, a vector \u03be \u2208 H and a commuting row\ncontraction T such that (ignoring the harmless imaginary constant)\nf (z) = hH(z, T )\u03be, \u03beiH\nRepresenting f \u2208 R+ in this way, we have\n(3.3)\n(3.4)\n\nfr (z) = hH(rz, T )\u03be, \u03beiH\n\n= hH(z, rT )\u03be, \u03beiH\n\nand hence fr \u2208 R+ since rT is a commuting row contraction.\n\n\u0003\n\nOf course, since a positive linear functional on C(\u2202Bd ) is just a finite\nBorel measure \u03bc supported on \u2202Bd , the Herglotz formula for M + takes\nthe form\nZ\n1 + hz, \u03b6i\nf (z) =\nd\u03bc(\u03b6) + iIf (0)\n\u2202Bd 1 \u2212 hz, \u03b6i\nin accord with the original definition.\nAs in the proof of the theorem, by combining the GNS representation\ntheorem with appropriate dilation theorems we can obtain equivalent\ndescriptions of R+ and S + that are sometimes useful. We first recall\nthat the original definition of S + is the set of all f \u2208 O such that the\nkernel\n(3.5)\n\nf (z) + f (w)\n1 \u2212 hz, wi\n\n\f12\n\nMICHAEL T. JURY\n\nis positive. In [6] it is shown that f \u2208 S + if and only if there exists a\nCuntz isometry V acting on a space H and a vector \u03be \u2208 H such that\nf (z) = hH(z, V )\u03be, \u03bei + If (0).\nBy Popescu's dilation theorem [8], every row contraction T dilates to\na Cuntz isometry, and hence S + consists of all functions of the form\n(3.6)\n\nf (z) = hH(z, T )\u03be, \u03bei + If (0).\n\nwhere T is any row contraction. In contrast, the Arveson dilation\ntheorem [2] says that every commuting row contraction dilates to a\nrepresentation of the d-shift S, and hence R+ consists of all functions\nf admitting a representation of the form (3.6) for some commuting row\ncontraction T .\nThe formalism established thus far leads to an \"abstract Herglotz\nformula\" characterizing positive classes P contained in S + :\nTheorem 3.3. To each positive class P \u2282 S + on Bd there corresponds\nb of the state space of the Cuntz algebra\na weak-* closed, convex subset P\nb and a real\nOd , such that f \u2208 P if and only if there exists a state \u03c1 \u2208 P\nnumber \u03bb \u2265 0 such that\n(3.7)\n\nf (z) = \u03bb\u03c1(H(z, V )) + If (0)\n\nb consist of all states representing functions f \u2208 P\nProof. Given P, let P\nas in (3.7). Since P is a positive class, Pb is convex, and it is straightforward to check that if \u03c1n \u2192 \u03c1 weak-*, then fn \u2192 f uniformly on\ncompact sets, so Pb is closed.\n\u0003\n\nIt must be kept in mind, however, that in general the state \u03c1 corresponding to f may be far from unique. This is even the case in M + ,\nsince the closed linear span of the Herglotz kernels and their adjoints\nis a proper subspace of C(\u2202Bd ).\nWe now return to the particular positive classes described by Theorem 3.2. Our main goal is to establish the duality between R+ and\nS + , resolving an open question of [6].\nTo begin with we recall the \"symmetrized functional calculus\" from\n[6]. If T = (T1 , . . . Td ) is a d-tuple of operators, we can make sense of a\nmonomial z \u03b1 in T by averaging over all possible orderings of the Ti 's.\nExplicitly, for a multi-index \u03b1 = (\u03b11 , . . . \u03b1d ) we define\n\u03b1! X\n(z \u03b1 )sym (T ) =\nTi1 Ti2 * * * Ti|\u03b1|\n|\u03b1|!\nwhere the sum is taken over all permutations of \u03b11 1's, \u03b12 2's, etc.\n\n\f13\n\nWe require one more definition: if f \u2208 O, define\nf\u02c7(z) := f (z)\nIf E \u2282 O, then let \u011a denote the functions f \u2208 O such that f\u02c7 \u2208 E.\nFinally we observe from the definition (3.5) of S + that \u0160 + = S + . The\nfollowing theorem identifies the dual of S + , answering a question posed\nby McCarthy and Putinar [6].\nTheorem 3.4. R+\u2217 = S + and S +\u2217 = R+ .\nProof. By the above discussion, g belongs to R+ if and only if there\nexists a commuting row contraction T on a Hilbert space H and a\nvector \u03be \u2208 H such that\n1\n(3.8)\n[g(z) + g(0)] = h(I \u2212 hz, T i)\u22121 \u03be, \u03bei\n2\n\u221e\nX\n(3.9)\nhhz, T ij \u03be, \u03bei\n=\nj=0\n\n(3.10)\n\n=\n\nX\n\u03b1\n\nz \u03b1 h(z \u03b1 )sym (T )\u03be, \u03bei\n\n|\u03b1|!\n\u03b1!\n\nIt follows that for any f \u2208 O and r < 1,\nQr (f, g) = 2h(f\u02c7r )sym (T )\u03be, \u03bei = 2hf\u02c7r (T )\u03be, \u03bei\nsince T commutes. So RQr (f\u02c7, g) \u2265 0 for all g \u2208 R+ if and only if\nRf\u02c7r (T ) \u2265 0 for all commuting row contractions T . Taking T = S\nshows that we must have f\u02c7r \u2208 S + for all r < 1, so fr \u2208 S + for all\nr < 1 and hence f \u2208 S + . But then Rf\u02c7r (T ) \u2265 0 for all commuting row\ncontractions T by von Neumann's inequality for S + . Thus, R+\u2217 = S + .\nThe opposite duality follows from Theorem 2.7.\n\u0003\nTheorem 3.5. R+ is a proper subset of S + .\nProof. Since R+ is the dual of S + , we show that S +\u2217 ( S + . Using the\ndescription of S + given in Theorem 3.2, by a calculation similar to that\nin the proof of Theorem 3.4 we see that f \u2208 S +\u2217 if and only if\nRhfrsym (V )\u03be, \u03bei \u2265 0\n\nfor all Cuntz isometries V . Suppose by way of contradiction that this\nis the case for all f \u2208 S + . Let A denote the set of all polynomials\np(S) \u2208 Td and let S be the operator system A + A\u2217 . Our assumption\nwould then imply that for every row isometry V acting on a Hilbert\nspace H, the map from S to B(H) given by\np(S) + q(S)\u2217 \u2192 psym (V ) + q sym (V )\u2217\n\n\f14\n\nMICHAEL T. JURY\n\nis positive. Then by [7, Corollary 2.8], the map sending p(S) to psym (V )\nis contractive. But Davidson and Pitts [3, Example 3.4] give an explicit\ncounterexample showing that this map is not contractive: in particu\u221a\nlar, for the polynomial p(z) = z1 + z1 z2 we have kp(S)k < 2 but\nkpsym (V )k = 25 . Thus R+ = S +\u2217 ( S + .\n\u0003\nTheorem 3.6. The following chain of inclusions holds, and each is\nproper:\nM + \u2282 R+ \u2282 S + \u2282 O + .\nProof. The inclusion of R+ in S + is given by the previous theorem.\nThe proper inclusion of S + in O + is well known, e.g. proved in [6]. By\nTheorem 3.4 the inclusion M + ( R+ is dual to S + ( O + .\n\u0003\nTheorem 2.8 guarantees the existence of a self-dual positive class\nlying between R+ and S + , however we do not know any concrete example.\nProblem 3.7. Give an explicit example of a self-dual positive class\nlying between R+ and S + .\n4. Extreme points\nIf P is a positive class, we can normalize each function f \u2208 P so that\nf (0) = 1; we denote the resulting subclass P0 . Since O0+ is compact, it\nfollows that P0 is also compact and hence by the Krein-Milman theorem\nit is the closed convex hull of its extreme points. It would obviously\nbe desirable to identify the extreme points of the classes R0+ and S0+ .\nIt is not hard to see that the extreme points of M0+ are exactly the\nfunctions obtained as Herglotz integrals of point masses; that is the\nextreme points of M0+ are the functions\nh\u03b6 (z) =\n\n1 + hz, \u03b6i\n,\n1 \u2212 hz, \u03b6i\n\n\u03b6 \u2208 \u2202Bd .\n\nIt is known that these functions are not extreme for O + ; for example\nwhen d = 2 the functions\n1 + z1\n+ z22 h(z1 , z2 )\n1 \u2212 z1\n\nbelong to O + whenever |h| \u2264 41 [9, Section 19.2.6]. We will show\npresently that the functions h\u03b6 are extreme points for S + ; but of course\nin S + there must be others as well. As a small step towards finding\nthem, we have the following.\n\n\f15\n\nProposition 4.1. If P0 is a normalized positive class lying between\nM0+ and S0+ and f is an extreme point of P0 , then there exists a pure\nstate on the Cuntz algebra Od such that\nf (z) = \u03c1(H(z, V ))\n\nProof. The proof is a routine application of the Krein-Milman theorem:\nlet S denote the set of all states \u03c1 on Od such that \u03c1(H(z, V ) belongs\nto P0 . S is a weak-* compact, convex set in the dual of Od . Let Sf \u2282 S\ndenote those states such that \u03c1(H(z, V )) = f . Sf is again compact and\nconvex, so by Krein-Milman is the closed hull of its extreme points. It\nis now not hard to see that if f is extreme then every extreme point\nof Sf is in fact extreme in S. Indeed, suppose f is extreme and \u03c1\nis extreme in Sf . If \u03c10 , \u03c11 \u2208 S satisfy t\u03c10 + (1 \u2212 t)\u03c11 = \u03c1 for some\nt \u2208 (0, 1), then taking Herglotz transforms shows \u03c10 , \u03c11 \u2208 Sf and hence\n\u03c10 = \u03c11 = \u03c1.\n\u0003\nOf course, the converse does not hold; there are many examples of\npure states \u03c1 for which the associated f is not extreme in S0+ .\nTo prove that the functions h\u03b6 are extreme for S + , we make use of the\nfollowing strengthened Schwarz lemma for the Schur class Sd . Recall\nthat a function \u03c6 belongs to Sd if and only if the Hermitian kernel\n\n1 \u2212 \u03c6(z)\u03c6(w)\n1 \u2212 hz, wi\nis positive semidefinite. A simple calculation shows that \u03c6 \u2208 Sd if and\n1+\u03c6\nonly if its Cayley transform 1\u2212\u03c6\nbelongs to S + .\nk \u03c6 (z, w) =\n\nLemma 4.2. Suppose g \u2208 Sd , g(0) = 0 and\n\u2202g\n(0) = 1.\n\u2202z1\nThen g(z) = z1 .\nProof. To say that g \u2208 Sd means that the kernel\n(4.1)\n\n1 \u2212 g(z)g(w)\n1 \u2212 hz, wi\n\nis positive. Let G denote the restriction of g to the disk D = {(z1 , 0) :\n|z1 | < 1}. Then G(0) = 0, G\u2032 (0) = 1 and |G(z)| \u2264 1 for all |z| < 1.\nBy the one-variable Schwarz lemma, we have G(z1 ) = z1 . Thus the\nrestriction of g to D equals z1 . But since restriction of the kernel (4.1)\nto D is\n1 \u2212 G(z1 )G(w1 )\n\u22611\n1 \u2212 z1 w1\n\n\f16\n\nMICHAEL T. JURY\n\nwhich trivially has finite rank, the function g|D has a unique extension\nto an Sd function in Bd . This forces g \u2261 z1 .\n\u0003\nTheorem 4.3. For each \u03b6 \u2208 \u2202Bd , the function\nh\u03b6 (z) =\nis an extreme point of S + .\n\n1 + hz, \u03b6i\n1 \u2212 hz, \u03b6i\n\nProof. Without loss of generality we assume \u03b6 = e1 = (1, . . . 0). Suppose there exist functions f, g in the Schur class Sd and t \u2208 (0, 1) such\nthat\n1 + z1\n1 + f (z)\n1 + g(z)\nh(z) = he1 (z) =\n=t\n+ (1 \u2212 t)\n1 \u2212 z1\n1 \u2212 f (z)\n1 \u2212 g(z)\nRestrict this equation to the disk D = {(z1 , 0) : |z1 | < 1}. Since\nh(z) = h(z1 ) is extreme for O + (D), it follows that f and g must equal\nz1 when restricted to D. By the uniqueness in the Schwarz lemma for\nSd , we must have f (z) = g(z) = z1 for all z \u2208 Bd . Thus h is extreme\nin S + .\n\u0003\nBy Proposition 4.1, there exists a pure state \u03c1 on Od such that\nh\u03b6 (z) = \u03c1(H(z, V )).\nIn fact it can be shown that in this case the state \u03c1 is unique, and equal\nto the Cuntz state \u03c9\u03b6 defined by\n\u03c9\u03b6 (Vi1 * * * Vim Vj\u22171 * * * Vj\u2217n ) = \u03b6i1 * * * \u03b6im \u03b6j1 * * * \u03b6jn .\nIt seems unlikely that there would be any very concrete parametrization of the extreme points of S0+ . Nonetheless at present we do not\nknow any extreme points of S0+ besides the functions h\u03b6 , so it would\nbe desirable to find other examples.\nIn the case of R0+ , the d-variable Toeplitz algebra Td is a type I\nC*-algebra so there is more hope of classifying the extreme points.\nHowever there is still the difficulty of the non-uniqueness of the Herglotz\nrepresentation. The argument in the proof of the previous proposition\nshows that every extreme point of R0+ comes from a pure state of Td ,\nhowever as in the case of S0+ simple examples show that the converse\ndoes not hold.\nProblem 4.4. Find other extreme points of S0+ and R0+ . Can the\nextreme points of R0+ be classified? Which pure states on Td (resp. Od )\ngive rise to extreme points?\n\n\f17\n\nWe conclude with a remark on the growth of functions in S + . One\nreason for historical interest in extreme points of O + was their connection with the inner function conjecture (namely, that there were no\ninner functions on the ball Bd when d > 1); in fact it had been conjectured that functions f \u2208 O + all belonged to the Hardy space H 1\n(see [9, Chapter 19]). The inner function conjecture turned out to be\nfalse, but it is obviously of interest to ask the same questions of other\nclasses, particularly S + . Recall that for 0 < p < \u221e, a function f \u2208 O\nbelongs to the Hardy space H p if and only if\nZ\n|f (r\u03b6)|p d\u03c3(\u03b6) < \u221e,\n(4.2)\nsup\n0<r<1\n\n\u2202Bd\n\nwhere \u03c3 denotes surface measure on the sphere. When p \u2265 1 the pth\nroot of this quantity defines a norm on H p . By standard estimates,\nthe extreme points h\u03b6 belong to H p for all p < d+1\n. In fact this is\n2\n+\ncharacteristic of the growth of functions in S :\nTheorem 4.5. S + (Bd ) \u2282 H p (Bd ) for all p <\nProof. Let g \u2208 S + and write g =\nmapping \u03c8 : Bd \u2192 Bd by\n\n1+\u03c6\n1\u2212\u03c6\n\nd+1\n.\n2\n\nfor \u03c6 \u2208 Sd . Define a holomorphic\n\n\u03c8(z) = (\u03c6(z), 0 . . . 0)\nSince \u03c6 \u2208 Sd , the kernel\n1 \u2212 \u03c6(z)\u03c6(w)\n1 \u2212 h\u03c8(z), \u03c8(w)i\n=\n1 \u2212 hz, wi\n1 \u2212 hz, wi\nis positive semidefinite. It follows that the composition operator\nC\u03c8 : f \u2192 f \u25e6 \u03c8\nis bounded on H 2 [4, Theorem 5], and hence bounded on H p for all\np < \u221e [5, Corollary 1.2]. Thus\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 + z1\n1+\u03c6\n= C\u03c8\ng=\n1\u2212\u03c6\n1 \u2212 z1\nbelongs to H p for all p <\n\nd+1\n.\n2\n\n\u0003\n\nIn contrast, O + contains functions which do not belong to H 1 ; indeed\n1+\u03c6\n\u2208\n/ H 1 . As a corollary we see that\nif \u03c6 is an inner function then g = 1\u2212\u03c6\nthe Schur class Sd does not contain any inner functions when d > 1.\n\n\f18\n\nMICHAEL T.
