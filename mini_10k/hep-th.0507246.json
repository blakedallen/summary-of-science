In the plane orthogonal to their direction\nthey correspond to a nontrivial deformation of the embedded Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen\n(ANO) vortices by the current flowing through them. The new solutions bifurcate with the\nANO vortices in the limit of vanishing current. They can be either static or stationary.\nIn the stationary case the relative phase of the two scalars rotates at constant velocity,\ngiving rise to an electric field and angular momentum, while the energy remains finite.\nThe new static vortex solutions have lower energy than the ANO vortices and could be\nof considerable importance in various physical systems (from condensed matter to cosmic\nstrings).\n\nIt is difficult to overemphasize the importance of \"topological defects\" (monopoles, vortex\nlines, domain walls, etc) resulting from the spontaneous breaking of global or local symmetries\nin modern physics, we refer to the some of the numerous reviews [1]. There is an interesting class of models in which both global and local symmetries are simultaneously broken, in\nthe most economical way, with the minimal number of scalar fields. These models, dubbed\nsemilocal models, have some remarkable features, see the detailed review [2]. Perhaps the most\nremarkable point is that semilocal models exhibit vortices, despite the first homotopy group of\nthe vacuum manifold being trivial [3, 4]. The simplest example of such a model is when electromagnetism is coupled to two charged complex scalars transforming as a doublet under a global\nSU(2) symmetry (extended Abelian Higgs model). This simple case is made quite interesting\nby noting that it represents the bosonic sector of the Electroweak theory in the limit that the\nWeinberg angle, \u03b8W = \u03c0/2 [5]. Furthermore such multicomponent Ginzburg-Landau models\nare also used in condensed matter theory, for example in the description of unconventional\nsuperconductors [6], in modeling neutral two-component plasmas [7]. The Abrikosov-NielsenOlesen (ANO) vortex solutions [8], characterized by the mass ratio, \u03b2 = ms /mv (ms resp. mv\ndenoting the mass of the scalar resp. of the vector fields), are embedded into this theory. The\nparameter \u03b2 also distinguishes superconductors of type I (\u03b2 < 1) from type II (\u03b2 > 1). The\ncase \u03b2 = 1 is quite special for here, instead of there being a unique vortex solution (the ANO\nvortex), there is a family of them labelled by a complex number of the same energy, satisfying\nthe Bogomol'nyi equations [9]. The stability of the embedded ANO vortices in Abelian models\nwith an extended Higgs sector was examined in Ref. [4], and it was shown there that they are\nstable only if \u03b2 \u2264 1. The counterparts of these solutions are the Z-strings in the Standard\nmodel which have been shown to be stable for sin2 \u03b8W & 0.9 [2].\nIn this Letter we present a new class of straight flux-tube solutions (strings) of the SU(2)\nsymmetric semilocal model which are translationally symmetric along the z = x3 direction.\n1\n\n\fThe new solutions form a one parameter family for any fixed value of \u03b2 > 1. The main feature\ndistinguishing them from the previously known string or equivalently vortex solutions in the\n(x1 , x2 ) plane, is due to the presence of a relative phase between the two scalars, depending\nlinearly on z. Because of this relative phase (twist) there is also a persistent current flowing\nalong the z-direction, so in fact these new objects are not genuinely planar vortices. The\nrelative phase may also have a linear dependence on the time coordinate, x0 , in which case the\nvortices are stationary and possess a nonzero momentum, angular momentum, as well as an\nelectric field. Due to the strong (exponential) localization of the fields the vortices have finite\nenergy per unit length. The energy of the current carrying solutions is lower than that of the\ncorresponding ANO vortex, therefore they should have better stability properties. When the\ncurrent vanishes the solution bifurcates with the embedded ANO vortex. In fact the well known\n\"magnetic spreading\" instability of the embedded type II (\u03b2 > 1) ANO vortex in the semilocal\nmodel can be understood as a signal of bifurcation with a new solution branch, which carry a\nnonvanishing current. The Z-string counterparts of the new solutions should also be present in\nthe Electroweak model and they may have better stability properties because of the localizing\neffect of the current. Our solutions can also be interpreted as superconducting cosmic strings\nof the bosonic type, but without an additional U(1) gauge field as in the prototype U(1)\u00d7U(1)\nmodel [10]. There are also some important differences between the superconducting strings in\nWitten's model as compared to the semilocal ones. For example the current carrying semilocal\nstrings are strongly localized.\nThe (suitably rescaled) Lagrangian of the SU(2) semilocal theory can be written as\n\u001a\n\u001b\n\u03b22\n1\n1\n\u03bc\u03bd\n2\n2\n2\n(1)\nL = 2 \u2212 F\u03bc\u03bd F + |D\u03bc \u03a6| \u2212 (|\u03a6| \u2212 1)\n2g\n2\n4\nwhere \u03a6 = (\u03c61 , \u03c62 ), D\u03bc = \u2202\u03bc \u2212 iA\u03bc , |\u03a6|2 = \u03c6\u03041 \u03c61 + \u03c6\u03042 \u03c62 , and g is the coupling constant, which\nwill be set to 1 for simplicity. The breaking of the U(1) gauge symmetry leads to the physical\nspectrum consisting of a vector particle with mass mv = g\u03b7, two Nambu-Goldstone bosons,\nand a Higgs scalar with mass ms = \u03b2\u03b7, \u03b7 is the vacuum expectation value of the scalar fields.\nThe most general translationally symmetric (in the x3 = z direction) and stationary Ansatz\ncan be written as\nA\u03bc = (A0 (x1 , x2 ) , Ai (x1 , x2 ))\n\ni = 1, 2, 3\n\n\u03c61 = f1 (x1 , x2 ) \u03c62 = f2 (x1 , x2 )ei(\u03c90 t+\u03c93 z) ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere (\u03c90 , \u03c93 ) = \u03c9\u03b1 , are real parameters. The most important feature of the Ansatz (2) is that\nthe change in the phase of the scalar fields under an infinitesimal translation is compensated\nby a nontrivial gauge transformation. In other words a space-time translation moves the\nfields along gauge orbits. Also the Ansatz (2) reduces the global SU(2) symmetry to U(1).\nThe Noether current associated to the remaining global U(1) symmetry is then simply J\u03bc =\ni(\u03c6\u03042 D\u03bc \u03c62 \u2212 \u03c62 D\u03bc \u03c62 )/2. Therefore the solutions described by the Ansatz (2) have a conserved\nNoether charge, I0 , as well as a current, I3 , flowing along the string where\nZ\n2\nI\u03b1 = \u00b1\u03b7\nd2 x(\u03c9\u03b1 \u2212 A\u03b1 )\u03c6\u03042 \u03c62 , \u03b1 = (0, 3) .\n(3)\nThe equations of motion imply the following \"Gauss-law\" constraints on A\u03b1 = (A0 , A3 ) in the\n(x1 , x2 ) plane:\n\u25b3A\u03b1 \u2212 A\u03b1 |\u03a6|2 + \u03c9\u03b1 \u03c6\u03042 \u03c62 = 0 .\n(4)\nNow exploiting the \"constraint\" equations (4) one can establish the following lower bound on\nthe total energy per unit length:\nE \u2265 \u03c0|n|\u03b7 2 + |\u03c9\u03b1 I\u03b1 | ,\n2\n\n(5)\n\n\fwhere n is an integer determining the magnetic flux. Furthermore from Eqs. (4) it also follows\nthat for any regular solution A0 = \u03c90 A3 /\u03c93 (\u03c93 6= 0), i.e. A0 is determined by A3 . This is\nrelated to the fact that one can still perform Lorentz transformations (boosts) in the (t, z)\nplane, which mix the A0 and A3 components of the vector potential, and also transform the\nparameters (\u03c90 , \u03c93 ) of the Ansatz (2). In fact it is only their Lorentz invariant combination,\n\u03c9 2 = \u03c932 \u2212 \u03c902 , that appears in the equations of motion. Therefore if \u03c9 2 > 0, by a Lorentz boost\none can always achieve \u03c90 = 0 , A0 = 0, i.e. it is sufficient to consider the static case only. It\nshould be pointed out here that the general Ansatz (2) has been also considered by Abraham\n[11] in the same model. He considered, however, exclusively the Bogomol'nyi equations existing\nonly in the very special case \u03b2 = 1. As found in Ref. [11] this implies further \u03c93 = \u03c90 i.e. \u03c9 2 = 0,\nwhich is referred to as the chiral case, when due to the lack of localization the energy of the\nsolutions exhibited in Ref. [11] (with winding number n = 1) diverges.\nTo simplify further the problem of finding current carrying string solutions of the semilocal\ntheory Eq. (1), we also impose rotational symmetry in the (x1 , x2 ) plane, leading finally to the\nfollowing Ansatz in polar coordinates:\nA0 = a0 (r) , Ar = 0 , A\u03c6 = na(r) , A3 = \u03c9a3 (r) ,\n\u03c61 = f1 (r)ein\u03c6\n\n\u03c62 = f2 (r)eim\u03c6 ei(\u03c90 t+\u03c93 z) ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere m = 0, . . . n \u2212 1. In this Letter we shall concentrate on the simplest m = 0 case, a\nmore exhaustive investigation will be published [12].

For r \u2192 \u221e the regular solutions decay exponentially: a = 1 + O (exp [\u2212br]),\na3 = O (exp [\u2212br]), f1 = 1 + O (exp [\u2212cr]), f2 = O (exp [\u2212\u03c9r]), where the constants, b, c,\ndetermining the exponential decay are given as b = min(1, 2\u03c9), c = min(2, \u03b2, 2\u03c9), and they\nalso comprise a 4-parameter family of local solutions. From this asymptotic behaviour it is\nclear that \u03c9 > 0 is an essential parameter to ensure exponential localization.

In view\nof the mathematical complexity of Eqs. (7) we have resorted to numerical techniques to obtain\nregular solutions. Adapting a multishooting procedure [13], we have succeeded in obtaining\nnumerically families of regular solutions of Eqs. (7), representing a new class of vortices; see\nFig. 1 for a sample vortex profile. For a given value of \u03b2 > 1 our solution class is parameterized\nby \u03c9, which varies in a finite interval 0 < \u03c9 \u2264 \u03c9b (\u03b2).

This bifurcation can be understood by\nlinearizing Eqs. (7) around the ANO solution with a3 \u226a 1, f2 \u226a 1.

(9) corresponds precisely to the linearized stability problem of the embedded ANO vortex\nin the semilocal theory studied by Hindmarsh [4]. In agreement with his results1 , for any\n\u03b2 > 1 we find a single normalizable solution, f2 , with negative eigenvalue, \u2212\u03c9b2 (\u03b2). In Ref.\n[4] this bound state is a sign of instability of the semilocal ANO vortex. In our case the very\nsame bound state indicates the bifurcation of a new branch with that of the ANO solution at\n\u03c9 = \u03c9b (\u03b2). Quite importantly the energy of the new solutions (with n = 1) is always smaller\nthan that of the ANO vortex. Therefore we expect the new solutions of winding number n = 1\nwith a nonzero current to be stable.\nIt is instructive to discuss also the \u03b2 = \u221e limiting theory, when the scalar fields are\nconstrained |f1 |2 + |f2 |2 \u2261 1, (a gauged CP1 -model) whose field equations can be written as:\na\u2032\n1\n(ra\u20323 )\u2032 = a3 \u2212 sin2 \u03b8, r( )\u2032 = a \u2212 cos2 \u03b8,\nr\nr\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1 \u2032 \u2032 1 2\n2 1\u22122a\n(r\u03b8 ) =\nsin(2\u03b8) ,\n\u03c9 (1 \u2212 2a3 ) \u2212 n\nr\n2\nr2\n\n(10a)\n(10b)\n\nwhere we have introduced f1 = cos \u03b8, f2 = sin \u03b8. The profile functions of the current carrying\nvortex solution of Eqs. (10) are qualitatively similar to those of Eqs. (7) (comp. Fig. 1). The\nenergy of the current carrying solutions is finite for any value of \u03c9, whereas the energy of the\n\u03b2 = \u221e ANO vortex diverges. This difference is also reflected by the fact that \u03c9b (\u221e) = \u221e, i.e.\nthe parameter \u03c9 varies in the interval (0, \u221e).\nThe phase space of the new solution class is illustrated on Fig. 2, choosing the total\n(0)\nenergy, E, the magnitude of the condensate at the origin, f2 and \u03c9 as parameters. On Fig.\n(0)\n2 a family of solutions for a fixed value of \u03b2 corresponds to a curve in the (f2 , \u03c9) plane, and\n1\n\nNote that our \u03b2 2 corresponds to \u03b2 of Ref. [4].\n\n4\n\n\fE/\u03c0\u03b7 2\n\u03b2=3\n2\n1.8\n\n\u221a\n\u03b2= 2\n\n1.6\n\nEANO\n\n\u03b2=2\n\n1.4\n1.2\n1\n\n\u03b2=1\n\n\u03b2=\u221e\n\nPSfrag replacements\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n\nf2(0) 0.6\n0.8\n1\n\n0\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n\u03c9\n\nFigure 2: Phase space of the n = 1 superconducting vortices.\nwe have indicated the corresponding ANO vortex, located at the endpoint of the curve in the\n(0)\nf2 = 0 plane where the new family bifurcates with it. The family of solutions for \u03b2 = \u221e\n(0)\nis represented by the curve in the f2 = 1 plane. As the value of \u03c9 decreases from \u03c9b (\u03b2)\ntowards \u03c9 = 0, the energy of all superconducting solutions decreases towards the Bogomol'nyi\nbound, E = \u03c0\u03b7 2 , without ever attaining it, irrespectively of the value of \u03b2. An important point\nis that solutions with nonzero values of \u03c9 do not have a smooth \u03c9 \u2192 0 limit, i.e. the point\n(0)\n(f2 = 1 , \u03c9 = 0) does not belong to the phase space as it is indicated on Fig. 2 by a circle. In\nthe \u03b2 = \u221e theory one can obtain the following virial relation\n\u001b\n\u001a\nZ \u221e\n\u20322\n2 \u20322\n2\n2a\n(11)\nrdr n 2 \u2212 \u03c9 [a 3 + (1 \u2212 2a3 ) sin \u03b8] = 0 ,\nr\n0\nwhich immediately implies that for \u03c9 = 0 the \u03b2 = \u221e theory does not admit nontrivial finite\nenergy solutions. For finite values of \u03b2, a suitable change of scale in Eqs. (7) shows that the\neffective value of the scalar self coupling is given by \u03b2eff = \u03b2/\u03c9. It follows that the limit \u03c9 \u2192 0\nalso implies \u03b2eff \u2192 \u221e, enforcing |f1 |2 + |f2 |2 \u2192 1. This explains the universal behaviour of the\nsolutions in the \u03c9 \u2192 0 limit. A more detailed analysis shows [12] that all solutions converge\npointwise to a limiting configuration corresponding the CP1 lump analyzed in Ref. [4].\nIn the limit \u03c9 \u2192 0 the value of the current, I3 , is getting large and it even seems to\ndiverge while \u03c9I3 \u2192 0. This behaviour of the current is in sharp contrast with what is found in\nthe U(1)\u00d7U(1) model, where the current has a maximal value above which the superconducting\nstring \"goes normal\" [14]. The z-component of the current, \u01283 = I3 /(2\u03c0\u03b7 2 ), is depicted on Fig.\n3 as a function of the parameter \u03c9.\nSince our vortex solutions exist only in type II superconductors (\u03b2 > 1) it is natural\nto ask as to their interaction energy (which is well known to be repulsive for the type II\nANO vortices). Since we have superimposed vortex solutions (for n > 1) we can ask if it\nis energetically favourable for them to break up into widely separated constituents.

The graphs on Fig.\n4 indicate that the interaction is repulsive up to a certain value of \u01283 , however, at least for the\nn = 2 vortex it becomes attractive when \u01283 > 0.71. This suggest that the n = 2 superimposed\nvortex for large enough currents becomes stable with respect to breakup into n = 1 vortices\nunlike the type II ANO vortices. If the interaction for separated vortices has also an attractive\nphase this could have important physical consequences (e.g. the attraction may significatively\nchange the intercommutation of colliding strings). Let us mention here that in a somewhat\ndifferent two-component Ginzburg-Landau model similar non-monotonic behaviour of E/n has\nbeen reported in [15].\nStationary solutions (with \u03c90 6= 0) are obtained by a Lorentz boost of the static ones along\nthe z-axis. The stationary vortices obtained this way have momentum, P = \u03c90 I3 /\u03c93 , angular\nmomentum, J = \u2212\u03c90 nI3 /\u03c93 , and they are surrounded by a radial electric field Er = \u03c90 a\u20323 .\nIt is interesting that in our case the electric field is screened, and the total energy of the\nsuperconducting vortices stays finite.\n6\n\n\fIn conclusion such current carrying strings provide a new interesting class of defects\nwhich may be realized in realistic physical systems described by semilocal models and they\nmay equally find their applications in a cosmological context as cosmic strings and may even\nbe present in the Standard model of Electroweak interactions. Finally we thank G. Volovik for\npointing out that twisted vortices have also been investigated and even experimentally observed\nin superfluid 3 He [16].\n\nReferences\n[1] A. Vilenkin, E. P. S.
