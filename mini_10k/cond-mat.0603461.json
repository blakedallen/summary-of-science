INTRODUCTION\n1\n\n\fThe problem of condensation of electron-hole pairs in semiconductors have recently\nattracted a great deal of research interest1,2. The Coulomb attraction ensures the formation of\nexcitons, which may condense and obey the Bose statistics at low densities and low enough\ntemperatures. In the large density case, collectively paired electrons and holes may form\nBCS-like state that is quite similar to the ensemble of Cooper pairs in a superconductor. The\npossibility of condensation in such systems was first discussed by L.V.Keldysh with coworkers3,4. The e-h condensation has been widely studied theoretically\n\n1,2,5-14\n\n. Bose\n\ncondensation of excitons is believed to be experimentally observed in some semiconductors\nand quantum-well structures 15-17.\nIt is generally accepted that electron-hole plasma can be created in a semiconductor\nby external optical pumping. The behaviour of electrons, holes, and quasiparticles in strong\nresonant electromagnetic fields was first considered by Galitzkii et al\n\n18,19\n\n. A model of a\n\nsemiconductor driven by a strong classical monochromatic laser field was investigated by\nComte and Mahler7. It was demonstrated that the presence of the laser field resulted in a\nlarge enhancement of the order parameter. Spectra of absorption and luminescence of\nelectron-hole condensate were theoretically studied in many papers\n\n13, 20-22\n\n. Lasing effect\n\nfrom coherent excitonic states in quantum-well structures was discussed by Flatte et al 23.\nSuperradiant emission in large-density nonequilibrium e-h systems in GaAs/AlGaAs\np-i-n heterostructures was experimentally studied at room temperature\n\n24-28\n\n. The carrier\n\ndensity exceeded (2-6).1018 cm-3 in the experiments. Large intensity (~ 109 W/cm-2)\nfemtosecond superradiant emission pulses were generated. The superradiant pulses were\nemitted from a narrow spectral bandwidth corresponding to the energy of the renormalized\nband gap24,25. It was shown that extremely large peak powers (energies) generated from a\nnarrow spectral range at femtosecond pulsewidths could not be explained by the standard\nFermi-Dirac distribution of electrons and holes in the bands and the square root dependence\nof density of states\n\n27\n\n. It was directly observed\n2\n\n28\n\nhow electrons and holes moved from\n\n\fenergy levels inside the bands towards the bottom of the conduction band and top of the\nvalence band. The condensation of the carriers at the energy levels right at the band gap\nresulted in the formation of the nonequilibrium BCS-like coherent state, which finally\nrecombined in the form of a femtosecond high-power superradiant pulse. It is worth to point\nout here that it is not possible to explain the results of the experiments24-28 in terms of the\nconventional theory of semiconductor lasers.\nThe main difficulty of the interpretation of available experimental data consists in the\nfact that the estimated order parameter \u2206 ~ 1-2 meV is much smaller compared with the\nsample temperature T = 25 meV. One of the goals of the present paper is to overcome this\nproblem. Here, we demonstrate that the critical temperature of the condensation at the lowest\nenergy level is determined by the Fermi energy in case of a highly degenerate e-h system\nrather than the order parameter in case of superconductivity. Electron-hole pairs condense at\nthe bottoms of the bands. When a pair is broken up, the electron and hole must make a\ntransition to a free energy level that exists at the Fermi energy \u03bce,h (see Fig. 1). On the other\nhand, Cooper pairs in a superconductor occupy a region near the Fermi surface. It is enough\nto have a small energy about the order parameter for breaking them up. In Section 2 of this\npaper we demonstrate the existence of a low-energy state near the band gap of a bound e-h\npair (a composite boson) in the large-density case. Section 3 proceeds with a qualitative\ndescription of the process of felling up of this level with composite bosons with the\nassistance of photons of a resonant electromagnetic field. Section 4 gives a theory of the\ncondensation of e-h pairs within the framework of the mean-field approximation. An\napproximate wave function of the condensate will be given, probabilities for the destruction\nof pairs and the critical temperature will be calculated.\n\nII. LOW-ENERGY STATE OF A BOUND E-H PAIR IN A SEMICONDUCTOR\n\n3\n\n\fThe problem of the existence of a low-energy state at the band gap of a bound e-h\npair has a great importance for the consideration of the e-h condensation in a semiconductor\nin large-density case at room temperature. Excitons states close to the Fermi energy, arising\nfrom the electron-hole Coulomb attraction, in a degenerate semiconductor was studied in\nRef. 29. Let us now discuss the existence of a low-energy state.\nIn this paper we restrict ourselves by a qualitative consideration of this problem and\nuse a simplified model, in which an electron and hole attract by the Coulomb force and\nmoves in a mean field of another particles and lattice. We neglect here any spin states since\nthey are not important\n\n30,31\n\n. This problem is pretty similar to problems of a weakly bound\n\nexciton and bound states of Cooper pairs (see, for instance, Ref. 30 and 31, respectively).\nThe Hamiltonian of the electron-hole system looks like\nH = H 0e + H 0 h \u2212\n\ne2\n,\n\u03b5 s | re \u2212 rh |\n\n(1)\n\nwhere\n\nH 0e, h\n\nh2\n=\u2212\n\u2207 2re, h + U e , h (re, h ).\n2me , h\n\n(2)\n\nHere U e , h (re, h ) is the effective potential of interaction between the electron (e) and hole (h)\n\nwith the lattice and another particles, re , h is the corresponding radius vector, \u03b5 s is the\ndielectric constant of the semiconductor.\nThe wave function of the e-h pair is determined by the solution of the Schrodinger\nequation with the Hamiltonian (1), (2). If one neglects the interaction of the pair with\nanother electrons and holes, then the problem leads to the classic excitonic solutions of the\nwell-known form with the hydrogen-like atom energy spectrum 30. By contrast, in the case of\nthe large density case the Coulomb attraction energy of the pair is a small parameter. In\naccordance with the standard perturbation theory31 we find the wave function in the form\ndecomposition on the wave functions of free electrons and holes 32\n\n4\n\n\f\u03a8 (re , rh ) =\n\n1\n\u2211 Ck , k ' exp[ikre + ik ' rh ] ,\nV k ,k '\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the summing up is done over all possible states within the Fermi surface, V is the\nvolume of the crystal. Substituting (3) into the Schrodinger equation, we obtain the\ndispersion equation for the energy of the pair E as\n2\n1\n1\n\u03b5 s kTF\n=\n.\n\u2211\nV k \u03b5 e (k ) + \u03b5 h (k ) \u2212 E 4\u03c0e 2\n\n(4)\n\nHere \u03b5 e , h (k ) is the eigenvalues of the energy of electrons and holes having the wavevector k .\nWe assume that the Coulomb interaction is screened with the Thomas-Fermi wave\nnumber kTF , and an electron and hole have wavevectors k and - k.\nThe dispersion equation (4) has a solution E0 , which lies below the band gap. This\nsolution corresponds to the bound state of the electron and hole. Indeed, in the range\n\n\u03b5 e (kmax ) + \u03b5 h (kmax ) > E > \u03b5 e (kmin ) + \u03b5 h (kmin ) , with kmax and kmin are maximum and minimum\nallowed wavevectors, the left part of Eq. (4) oscillates quickly and has multiple resonances.\nBy contrast, in the range E < \u03b5 e (kmin ) + \u03b5 h (kmin ) it is positively defined and asymptotically\ndecreases when E \u2192 \u2212\u221e . This implies that the Eq. (4) do have a solution in the required\nrange.\nIn terms of a simplified model of a semiconductor with the isotropic parabolic bands\none has\n\n\u03b5 e (k ) + \u03b5 h (k ) =\n\nh 2k 2 h 2k 2\n+\n+ Eg ,\n2me 2mh\n\n(5)\n\nwhere Eg is the band gap in an infinite crystal. A ratio of heavy and light holes in intrinsic\nGaAs, used in the experiments Ref. 24-28, is around 7:1, the heavy hole mass being\nmh \u2248 0.5m0 , the effective electron mass me \u2248 0.067 m0 , with m0 being mass of the electron.\nWe neglect the movement of the holes and do summing in Eq. (4) by electron state in the\n\n5\n\n\fconduction band. Replacing the sum by the integration, we have the following form of the\ndispersion equation\n2 me3 / 2\n\u03c0 2 h3\n2 2\nwhere \u03c7 = h k\n\n2me\n\n\u03c7 max\n\n\u222b\u03c7\n\nmin\n\n\u03c7 d\u03c7\n\n2\n\u03b5 s kTF\n=\n,\n\u03c7 + Eg \u2212 E0 4\u03c0e 2\n\n(6)\n\n. The lower integration limit corresponds to the minimum possible wave\n\nnumber k min , which is determined by the dimensions of the crystal. The upper limit is\nchosen to be determined by the Thomas-Fermi wave number kTF=[16mee2/(\u03c0\u03b5s)](6\u03c02n) -1/3.\nSolutions of Eq. (6) differ strongly depending on the sign of Eg \u2212 E0 . When the\nbound e-h state lies below Eg for an infinite crystal, we have after the integration an implicit\nalgebraic equation\n1/ 2\n(18\u03c0 ) 1 / 3 \uf8eb Ry\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f6\n\u03b4\n1\n1 \u2212 \u03b4 \u2212 x \uf8efarctan\uf8ec\narctan\n,\n=\n\u2212\n\uf8ec \u03c7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\nx \uf8fa\uf8fb\nx\uf8f8\nmax \uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ed\nrs\n\uf8f0\n\nwith x =\n\n( Eg \u2212 E0 )\n\n(7)\n\n\u03c7 min\n\u03c7 max , \u03b4 =\n\u03c7 max << 1 , Ry is the exciton Rydberg and rs is the mean\n\ninterparticle distance in the units of the exciton Bohr radius.\nIt is clear that the function on the left hand side of Eq. (7) has values in the range of\n(0,1). When the e-h density increases, i.e. rs decreases, the value of the right hand side of\nEq. (7) increases, Eq. (7) being unsolvable starting from a certain value rscr . In order to\nestimate rscr let us assume that \u03c7 min ~ 0.

Figure 2(a) shows\nthe solution of Eq. (7) which is valid for densities smaller that the critical one rs > rscr . It is\nworth to mention here that the extrapolation of solutions of Eq. (7) into the range of small\ndensities does not have solutions in the form of excitons. Indeed, the dispersion equation (4)\nwas derived as a result of the decomposition on the wave functions of unbound electrons and\n7\n\n\fholes (3). This assumption is valid at large enough densities, when a perturbation, which is\nproduced by neighbour electrons and holes, substantially affects the spectrum of the bound\npair. E0 against rs at densities larger than critical is plotted in Fig. 2 (b) for different values\nof the parameter \u03b4 ~ (k TF d ) \u22122 . These dependencies illustrate a fast asymptotic approach of\nthe bound state to the bottom of the band with increasing density.\nThe present analysis has shown the existence of bound states in a dense e-h\nensemble. These states locate at energies just below the band gap Eg. Now let us discuss in\ndetails the process of filling up of this bosonic state.\n\nIII. MECHANISM OF CONDENSATION ONTO BOSONIC LEVELS\n\nHere we consider the following mechanism of the formation of the condensate. It has\nbeen proposed earlier in Ref. 27 and 28. As a result of spontaneous radiative recombination\nof electrons and holes in the active layer of a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure, a macroscopic\nelectromagnetic field develops at the narrow spectral range right at the band gap. The\ncorresponding profile of the optical gain\n\n27\n\ncan be provided by a proper reverse bias on the\n\nabsorber of the structure. This ensures the absorption of photons with shorter wavelengths.\nConsider now an electron and hole that locate at the bottom of the conduction band and top\nof the valence band, correspondingly. A photon of the electromagnetic field is a resonant one\nfor them (see the initial state in Fig. 3). The photon causes their stimulated radiative\nrecombination and one has two identical photons as an intermediate state in Fig. 3. Due to a\nvery fast intraband thermolization, the energy levels, which became free, are quickly\noccupied by an electron and hole from levels with higher energy. At the same time as a\nresult of the opposite process, one of the photons generates a bound e-h pair, which is\ncoherent for some time with the electromagnetic field. The bound pair occupies the bosonic\nlevel discussed in the previous Section (the final state in Fig. 3). The absorption of the\nphoton with the generation of unbound electron and hole does not happen since all the\n8\n\n\felectrons and holes levels at the bottom of the band are occupied. This process takes place\nagain and again.\nAn ensemble of bound e-h pairs (composite bosons), which have zero total\nwavevector, develops with the assistance of the resonant electromagnetic field. In addition,\nthis field enforces coherency throughout the forming condensate. Therefore, a photonassisted drain of particles occurs from fermionic ensemble of unbound electrons and holes to\nbosonic system of bound pairs. Once again, the process of the condensation is thought to\nhappen due to the emission of photons with recombination of carriers from fermionic states,\nwhereas the absorption of photons occurs on bosonic states of bound pairs. This leads to the\ncondensation in the phase space. Because bound e-h pairs are bosons composed with two\nfermions, they cannot occupy just one energy level. In case of larger density the energy\ndistribution of bound e-h pairs resembles that of Cooper pairs (see, for instance Ref. 24,25,\nand 27).\nThe break-up of bound pairs occurs due to their scattering by optical phonons with\ntransitions of electrons and hole to free energy levels inside the bands near the Fermi\nsurface27. Radiative recombination of a bound pair with the generation of a photon does not\nresult in the destruction of the condensate. This is because the pair is virtually a two-level\nsystem, and the photon annihilates with the generation of an identical bound pair within a\ntime interval shorter compared with the round trip time inside the crystal. In a certain time\nthe condensate coherently recombines via the generation of a high-power cooperative\n(superradiant) femtosecond pulse. The peak power and pulse width is determined by the\ngeometry of the sample and the phase relaxation time T2 24-28.\nIt should be noted that without a resonant electromagnetic field the bosonic level is\nvirtually empty because \u2206 << kT. We discuss here the crucial role of the internal resonant\nelectromagnetic field. However, it is clear that this role can be played by any external photon\nfield having a properly chosen energy (frequency) and intensity.\n\n9\n\n\fIV. CRITICAL TEMPERATURE OF THE CONDENSATE\n\nAs we mentioned above, the range of densities achieved experimentally24-28 was\n(2 \u00f7 6) \u00d7 1018 cm \u22123 , the corresponding values rs ~ 0.31 \u00f7 0.59 . Note that the value of the\nexciton Rydberg and the dielectric constant in GaAs are Ry \u2248 4 meV and \u03b5 s \u2248 13.4 ,\nrespectively. For the description of the condensate we use a standard approach based on the\nBogolubov transformation, which has been previously developed by different authors2-14.\nHowever, it is necessary to point out a substantial difference between the physical situation\ndescribed in those papers and conditions of the experiments in Ref. 24-28. It was supposed\nin the theoretical papers that electron-hole pairs were created by an external optical field\nwith the photon energy h\u03c9 L > E g . This fixes the chemical potential of the electron-hole\nplasma \u03bc * due to the relation7\n\n\u03bc * = h\u03c9 L \u2212 E g .\n\n(13)\n\nAs a result one has a) the resonant interaction of the electromagnetic field occurs with e-h\npairs that occupy energy level near the Fermi energy; b) the plasma density is determined by\nthe field amplitude and its frequency. These strict connections were absent in the\nexperiments24-28. The plasma density and consequently the chemical potential were\nconditioned by the current injection, whereas the photon energy of the resonant interaction\nwas determined by the profile of the optical gain. The latter was controlled by the voltage\nbias on the absorber section of devices 27,28. In this case the condition (13) is not fulfilled and\nwe can have the following conditions\n\n\u03bc \u2212 h\u03c9\n\nT\n\n\u03bc \u2212 h\u03c9\n\n>> 1,\n\n\u2206\n\n>> 1\n\n(14)\n\nright until the very bottoms of the bands.\nWe restrict ourselves here by consideration of electrons and heavy holes since the\nnumber of light holes is relatively small in GaAs. The full Hamiltonian is a sum of the\n10\n\n\fkinetic energy of electrons and holes, the energy of their Coulomb interaction, and the\nenergy of the resonant interaction with the electromagnetic field\nH T = H kin + H Coul + H L .\n\n(15)\n\nHere\nH kin = \u2211 Ee (k )ak+ ak + Eh (k )bk+bk ,\n\n(16)\n\nk\n\nwhere ak+ , ak , bk+ , bk are the operators of the generation and annihilation of electrons and holes\nwith the wave number k , correspondingly. Their energies are Ee , h (k ) =\n\nEg\n\n2\n\n2 2\n+h k\n\n2me , h\n\n.\n\nThe Coulomb part of Eq. (15) is\nH Coul =\n\n1\nVq [ak++ q ak+'\u2212 q ak 'ak + bk++ qbk+'\u2212 qbk 'bk \u2212 2ak++ qbk+'\u2212 qbk 'ak ],\n\u2211\n2 k , k ', q\n\n(17)\n\nwhere\n2 2\nVq = 4\u03c0e h\n\n\u03b5 sq2\n\n.\n\n(18)\n\nThe last part of Eq. (15) is given by\nH L = \u2211 (d 0 EL )(ak+b\u2212+k exp[\u2212i\u03c9t ] + ak b\u2212 k exp[i\u03c9t ]) .\n\n(19)\n\nk\n\nHere d 0 is the effective dipole matrix element of the interband transition, being weakly\ndependent on k , EL is the amplitude of the electric field, being monochromatic one with the\nfrequency \u03c9 , E = EL sin[ kl r \u2212 \u03c9t ] . Note that we keep in (19) the resonant transitions, the\nelectrons and hole have equal wave numbers k and \u2013 k (k >> k L ).\nThe great canonical transformation\n\n18,19\n\nallows us to eliminate the dependence on\n\ntime in Eq. (16). After the energy renormalization we have the Hamiltonian\nH = \u2211 ( Ee (k ) \u2212 h\u03c9 / 2)ak+ ak +( Eh (k ) \u2212 h\u03c9 / 2)bk+ bk + H Coul +\nk\n\n\u2211 (d0 EL )(ak+b\u2212+k + b\u2212 k ak )\n\n(20)\n\nk\n\nWe use the Bogolubov transformation31 for the diagonalisation of the Hamiltonian\n(20)\n11\n\n\f\u03b1 k+ = uk ak+ + vk b\u2212 k ,\n\n\u03b2 k+ = uk bk+ \u2212 vk a\u2212 k\n\nuk2 + vk2 = 1\n\n(21)\n\nThe Fermi operators \u03b1 k+ ,\u03b1 k , \u03b2 k+ , \u03b2 k describe new quasiparticles, dressed electrons and holes.\nAfter introducing (21) into (20) one gets\nH = H0 + H2 + H4 ,\n\n(22)\n\nwhere H 0 does not contain the operators of the quasiparticles,\nH 0 = \u2211 [\u03be k vk2 \u2212 2(d 0 EL )uk vk ] \u2212 \u2211Vk \u2212 k ' (uk vk uk 'vk ' + vk2vk2' ) ,\nk\n\n(23)\n\nk ,k '\n\nand represents in fact the ground state. H 2 looks like\nH 2 = \u2211 [\u03b5 k\u03b1 \u03b1 k+\u03b1 k + \u03b5 k\u03b2 \u03b2 k+ \u03b2 k ] + \u2211 [\u03b4 k uk vk \u2212 (uk2 \u2212 vk2 )\u2206 k ](\u03b1 k+ \u03b2 \u2212+k + \u03b2 \u2212 k\u03b1 k ) ,\nk\n\n(24)\n\nk\n\nH 4 has all possible quadruple multiples of the operators. It describes processes of scattering\n\nof quasiparticles. It is not essential for our treatment and will be omitted from now on. Note\nthat the Coulomb terms in H 4 correspond to scattering on large angles, whereas the\ndominant scattering on small angles is taken into account in H 2 and H 0 . In (23), (24) the\nfollowing parameters are introduced 7\n1\n2\n\n\u03b5 k\u03b1 = (\u03b5 k + \u03c2 k ) ,\n\n1\n2\n\n\u03b5 k\u03b2 = (\u03b5 k \u2212 \u03c2 k )\n\n(25)\n\nare the quasiparticle energies,\n\u22060k = 2\u2211Vk \u2212 k 'uk 'vk '\n\n\u2206 k = \u22060k + 2(d 0 EL ) ,\n\n(26)\n\nk'\n\nis the effective order parameter.

The expressions\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n(23)-(27) are the result of a simple substitution of the Bogolubov transformation into the\nHamiltonian (20). Similar expressions have been previously derived in the numerous papers\n(see, for instance, Ref. 1,2, 5-23). The dynamic Stark effect and the consequent increase of\nthe order parameter were studied by Comte and Mahler7, while the effect of a strong\nresonance field was discussed in Ref. 18 and 19.\nThe order parameter can be found as a solution of the equation\n\n\u03b4 k uk vk \u2212 (uk2 \u2212 vk2 )\u2206 k = 0 ,\n\n(28)\n\nIts numerical solutions for a wide range of parameters were studied by many authors1,2, 5-23.\nTypical values of the order parameter are in the range of a few meV. The experimentally\nestimated value was \u2206 ~ (1-2) meV 24-27. However, the experiments were carried out at room\ntemperature T \u2248 25 meV >> \u2206 .\nIn the BCS theory of the superconductivity the critical temperature is of the order of\nthe energy gap \u2206 . This is because Cooper pairs are formed by electrons, which locate near\nthe Fermi surface, where many free spaces exist. An energy about \u2206 is enough for the\ndestruction of any Cooper pair. A similar situation exists in the case of e-h condensation in a\nsemiconductor1,2,5-23, when the carrier density is not large and the photogeneration of pairs\noccurs far inside the bands near the Fermi energy (see Eq. (13)).\nThe features of the system under study are a) the interaction of e-h pairs with the\nelectromagnetic field happens within a narrow spectral band at the band gap; b) a very large\ncarrier density and strong degeneracy of the semiconductor at room temperature. Indeed, the\n2\n2/3\nFermi energy of electrons and holes are \u03b5 Fe = (3\u03c0 N )\n\nme\n\n\u2248 350 meV and \u03b5 Fh \u2248 45 meV\n\nat the carrier density ~ 6 \u00d7 1018 cm \u22123 . As a result, if a pair gets an additional energy of about\n\n\u2206 ~ 2-4 meV, it cannot break up into the electron and hole, since all states, which are\navailable for transitions, are occupied by unpaired electrons and holes 27, 28 (see Fig. 1).\n13\n\n\fFor the description of this situation, it is required to determine an approximate wave\nfunction of the condensed state. In order to do this, we use an analogy with the wave\nfunction of the vacuum state of Bogolubov quasiparticles\n| vac >= \u220f (u k \u2212 v k a k+ b\u2212+k ) | 0 > .\n\n(29)\n\nHere | 0 > is the state of intrinsic vacuum of the semiconductor, i.e. the absence of electrons\nand holes. The wave function (29) can be used as a first approximation of the ground state of\nthe e-h condensate in a semiconductor. It describes low-density plasma, when the number of\nexcitations is small 2, 5-7, 33.\nIn our case the condensed state exists in combination with a broad layer of a normal\nFermi plasma of electrons and holes having larger energies. Unpaired particles block all\npossible channels of decay of bound e-h pairs of the condensate\n\n27\n\n. It is this reason that is\n\nresponsible of a dramatically enhanced critical density of the condensed state. This fact must\nbe taken into account in the wave function of the ground state.\nBecause approximate eigenstates of the system look like \u03b1 k+i \u03b1 k+j \u03b2 k+n | vac > , it is\nworth to choose the wave function of the ground state as\n| \u03c6 0 >= \u220f \u03b1 k+ \u03b2 k+' | vac > ,\n\n(30)\n\nk ,k '\n\nwhere the multiplication is evaluated for all occupied electron k and hole k ' states, which\nare determined by the energy distribution of the injected carriers with corresponding Fermi\nenergies.\nThe destruction of e-h pairs happens due to collisions with optical phonons with\nsimultaneous transitions of electrons and holes to states with larger energies.\n\nThe\n\nHamiltonian of the interaction can be written as\nH ph = VQe a k++Q a k + VQh bk++Q bk\n\n(31)\n\n14\n\n,\n\n\fwhere VQe ,h are the operators acting on the wave function of the phonon, Q is its\ncorresponding wave number. Let consider now a probability of a transition of an electron\nwith the wave number k from the initial state (the ground state of the system | \u03c6 0 > ) to the\nfinal state\n| \u03c6 f >= \u03b1 k++Q\u03b1 k | \u03c6 0 >\n\n(32)\nwith the wave number k + Q . The amplitude of the transition is\nAk ,k +Q =< VQe > u k +Q u k < vac | \u03b1 k \u03b1 k+\u03b1 k +Q\u03b1 k++Q\u03b1 k \u03b1 k+ | vac > ,\n\n(33)\n\nwhere < VQe > is the matrix element taken for the phonon wave function. The squared matrix\nelement should be multiplied by the occupation numbers of the initial and free final states\nv k2 (1 \u2212 f ke+ Q ) .\n\nThus, the probability of the transition of an electron from the state k , which is paired\nwith a hole \u2013 k, to the state k + Q with the absorption of a phonon is\nW e (k , k + Q) =\n\n(\n\n2\u03c0\n(N Q + 1) M k ,Q 2 u k2 vk2 u k2+Q (1 \u2212 f ke+Q ) \u00d7\nh\n\u03b4 ( E e ( k + Q ) - E e ( k ) - h\u03a9 )\n\n(34)\n\n)\n\n\u22121\n\nwhere N Q = exp[h\u03a9 ] \u2212 1 is the phonon distribution number. The energy of the optical\nT\nphonon in GaAs h\u03a9 \u2248 36 meV can be considered to be practically constant for all phonons\nhaving wave numbers about Fermi one k F ~ 10 7 cm \u22121 . f ke+ Q is the Fermi function of the\nstandard distribution of unpaired electron in the state k + Q .

The values of (37) and (38) are\nrelatively small at low enough temperatures. The condensate is stable for some time. Due to\nits resonant interaction with propagating electromagnetic field, the latter establishes\ncoherency and condensation occurs faster and faster. The collective coherent e-h state finally\ndecays radiatively in a superradiant manner, and we observe the emission of large\nfemtosecond pulses\n\n24-28\n\n. As the temperature increases, the value of (38) begins to be larger\n\n16\n\n\fthan the critical value. Yet the cooperative state has no enough time to be formed, the\ncollective decay does not happen, and finally e-h ensemble recombines spontaneously. In\nthis case one see a low-intensity nanosecond output pulse.\nIt seems to be pretty obvious to determine the critical temperature of the condensate\nTc by the condition of equality of the characteristic decay time of the e-h condensate W \u22121 (T )\nto the characteristic incubation time of superradiance \u03c4 s\nW (Tc )\u03c4 s ~ 1\n\n(39)\n\nIt is well-known from the theory of superradiance 34,35 that the incubation time is determined\nby the characteristic Dicke time \u03c4 D =\n\n8\u03c0ST1\n, where S is the emission cross section, N is the\n3\u03bb2 N\n\nnumber of particles in the sample, T1 is the spontaneous relaxation time, and \u03bb is the\nemission wavelength. An approximate relation between these times gives 34,35\n\uf8eb1\n\uf8ed2\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\n\n2\n\n\u03c4 s ~ \u03c4 D \uf8ec ln N \uf8f7\n\n(40)\n\nUsing (40), one can get a generally universal dependence \u03c4 s ~ 1 / N . However, when the\nsuperradiant pulse width is much shorter that the transit time,35 the accuracy of the relation\n(40) is too poor. By the numerical solution of full system of Maxwell-Bloch equations, \u03c4s\nwas estimated to be 1-2 ps for our case.35\nFigure 5 shows dependencies of the critical temperature on the e-h density obtained\nusing the condition (39). The characteristic superradiant time \u03c4 s was taken to be 1, 1.5, and\n2 ps for the carrier density 3 \u00d7 1018 cm \u22123 . The corresponding time for other densities was\nrecalculated using the relation \u03c4 s ~ 1 / N . It is clearly seen that the critical temperature is\nmuch larger than the parameter \u2206 ~ 2 \u2212 4 meV and can exceed room temperature. The\ncritical temperature Tc increases sharply with the concentration and is relatively small at\n\ndensities\n\n< 2 \u00d7 1018 cm \u22123\n\nthat\n\ncorrespond\n\n17\n\nto\n\nlasing\n\nconditions\n\nin\n\nGaAs/AlGaAs\n\n\fheterostructures.36 Therefore, estimated values of the critical temperature are in qualitative\nagreement with available experimental data 24-28.\n\nV. CONCLUSION\n\nWe have presented in this paper the qualitative model, which can explain the results\nof the experiments\n\n24-28\n\n, where the e-h condensation was observed at room temperature. We\n\nhave shown that in case of larger carrier densities and strong degeneracy of the\nsemiconductor the critical temperature of the condensation is determined by the Fermi\nenergy of the plasma components. This is conditioned by the necessity for the electron (hole)\nof a pair to perform a transition to one of free states, which locate at the Fermi energy.27\nSuch transition needs an energy much larger compared with the order parameter \u2206 .\nThis should not be considered as a contradiction to previous theories of e-h\ncondensation because we deal here with a substantially different situation. The energy region\nof the quasiparticles interaction between each other and with the resonant electromagnetic\nfield in our case lies far below the Fermi energy.\nWe have also demonstrated that in dense degenerate e-h plasma there exists an\nenergy level for the bound e-h state, which locates right below the band gap. This level\napproaches the boundary of the quasicontinuous spectrum of unpaired particles of the\nplasma as the density increases. This low-energy level is virtually empty under normal\nconditions and at room temperature since \u2206 << kT. It is the resonant electromagnetic field,\nwhich plays a crucial role in filling the level up and the condensation of composite bosons\n(bound e-h pairs) on to it. The electromagnetic field can be either internal recombination\nfield, or an external laser field with properly chosen wavelength and amplitude.\nThe critical temperature of the condensation in the system under study is determined\nby the relation (39), which connects the probability of breaking a bound pair up with the\n\n18\n\n\fcharacteristic superradiant incubation time. The estimated values of Tc are in good\nagreement with available experimental data.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe authors would like to thank H.Kan and T.Hiruma of Hamamatsu Photonics K.K.\nfor the financial support and Yu.M.Popov of PN Lebedev Physical Institute for the helpful\ndiscussions.\n\n* Electronic address: peter@mail1.lebedev.ru\n1\n\nBose-Einstein Condensation, ed.
