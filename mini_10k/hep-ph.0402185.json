These sums are not independent but\nconnected by different kind of relations. In the\npresent paper we summarize a first class of relations recently being discussed in Ref. [16], the\nso-called algebraic relations. 1 It turns out that\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\nMultiple nested alternating and non-alternating\nharmonic sums Sa1 ,...,an (N ) [1\u20133] emerge in perturbative higher order calculations within QED\nand QCD for massless fermions,\nSa1 ,...,an (N ) =\n\nk1\nN X\nX\n\nkn\u22121\n\n...\n\nk1 =1 k2 =1\n\n...\n\nX sign(a1 )k1\n|a1 |\n\nkn =1\n\nsign(an )kn\n|a |\n\nkn n\n\n.\n\nk1\n\n(1)\n\nHere, ak are positive or negative integers and\nN is a positive even or odd integer depending on the observable under\nPn consideration. One\ncalls n the depth and\nk=1 |ak | the weight of\na harmonic sum. Harmonic sums are associated to Mellin transforms of real functions or\nSchwartz\u2013distributions f (x) \u01eb S \u2032 [0, 1] [4]\nZ 1\ndx xN fa1 ,...,an (x) (2)\nSa1 ,...,an (N ) =\n0\n\nwhich emerge in field theoretic calculations. Finite harmonic sums are related to harmonic\npolylogarithms Hb1 ,...,bn (x) [5]. Their 1/(1 \u00b1\nx)\u2013weighted Mellin transform yields harmonic\nsums. The inverse Mellin transform relates\nthe harmonic sums to functions of Nielsen integrals [6] of the variable x at least for all sums\nof weight w \u2264 4 as shown in [3], and associated\ngeneralizations for higher weight. Nielsen integrals are a generalization of the usual polylog-\n\n1 For\n\n1\n\nfurther relations see [17].\n\n\f2\nthese relations emerge from the index-structure\nand the multiplication relation of the objects considered and are widely independent of other properties of the harmonic sums. In this way an equivalence class of even more objects is defined having the same properties or can be found as special\ncases thereof. One example is the set of the harmonic polylogarithms [5].\nTo obtain manageable expressions it is of importance to apply all these relations through\nwhich the number of basic functions to be referred\nto is considerably reduced. Experience shows\nthat the Mellin space representation yields simpler expressions in general [18], which would not\nbe seen easily working in x space. To obtain as\nsimple as possible expressions it is of special importance because of the fact that data\u2013analyses\nrequire compact results in x\u2013space, which can be\nobtained using analytic continuations for the basic sums [19] and performing a single numeric\nMellin inversion [20] for the whole problem.\nSince the evaluation of precise analytic continuations needs special effort any possible reduction\ncarried out before is of help.\n2. ALGEBRAIC RELATIONS\nThe product of two finite harmonic sums (1)\nyields\nSa1 ,...,an (N ) * Sb1 ,...,bm (N )\n=\n\nN\nX\nsign(a1 )l1\n|a1 |\n\nl1 =1\n\n+\n\nl1\n\nN\nX\nsign(b1 )l2\n|b |\n\nl2 =1\n\nl2 1\n\nSa2 ,...,an (l1 ) Sb1 ,...,bm (l1 )\n\nof depth n and m, Sa1 ,...,an (N ) and Sb1 ,...,bm (N ),\nis the sum of all harmonic sums of depth m + n\nin the index set of which ai occurs left of aj for\ni < j and likewise for bk and bl for k < l. As\nan example the shuffle product of two threefold\nharmonic sums is given by\nSa1 ,a2 ,a3 (N ) \u2294\u2294 Sa4 ,a5 ,a6 (N ) =\nSa1 ,a2 ,a3 ,a4 ,a5 ,a6 (N ) + Sa1 ,a2 ,a4 ,a3 ,a5 ,a6 (N )\n+Sa1 ,a2 ,a4 ,a5 ,a3 ,a6 (N ) + Sa1 ,a2 ,a4 ,a5 ,a6 ,a3 (N )\n+Sa1 ,a4 ,a2 ,a3 ,a5 ,a6 (N ) + Sa1 ,a4 ,a2 ,a5 ,a3 ,a6 (N )\n+Sa1 ,a4 ,a2 ,a5 ,a6 ,a3 (N ) + Sa1 ,a4 ,a5 ,a6 ,a2 ,a3 (N )\n+Sa1 ,a4 ,a5 ,a2 ,a6 ,a3 (N ) + Sa1 ,a4 ,a5 ,a2 ,a3 ,a6 (N )\n+Sa4 ,a5 ,a6 ,a1 ,a2 ,a3 (N ) + Sa4 ,a5 ,a1 ,a6 ,a2 ,a3 (N )\n+Sa4 ,a5 ,a1 ,a2 ,a6 ,a3 (N ) + Sa4 ,a5 ,a1 ,a2 ,a3 ,a6 (N )\n+Sa4 ,a1 ,a5 ,a6 ,a2 ,a3 (N ) + Sa4 ,a1 ,a5 ,a2 ,a6 ,a3 (N )\n+Sa4 ,a1 ,a5 ,a2 ,a3 ,a6 (N ) + Sa4 ,a1 ,a2 ,a3 ,a5 ,a6 (N )\n+Sa4 ,a1 ,a2 ,a5 ,a3 ,a6 (N ) + Sa4 ,a1 ,a2 ,a5 ,a6 ,a3 (N )\n(5)\n\nFinally one establishes a system of linear equations in which the linear elements of the shuffle\nproducts form the variables and a polynomial out\nof harmonic sums of lower depth forms the inhomogeneity. We furthermore consider all index\npermutations. This system contains all algebraic\nrelations. In Ref. [16] all solutions for harmonic\nsums up to depth d = 6 were given. This complies\nto the level of sophistication needed to reduce the\ncorresponding relations which emerge for massless 3\u2013loop coefficient functions.\n3.

The shuffle product of two harmonic sums\n\nLet us consider the index set of a harmonic sum\nof depth d. One may consider this set as a word\nw or a non\u2013commutative product of letters of an\nordered alphabet A = {a, b, c, d, . . .}. Any word\ncan be decomposed into three parts\nw = pxs ,\n\n(6)\n\na prefix p, a suffix s, and the remainder part\nx. Among all words w the Lyndon words, cf.\ne.g. [21], are those being smaller than any of its\nsuffixes.\nAccording to a Theorem by Radford [22] the\nshuffle algebra discussed above is freely generated\n\n\f3\nby the Lyndon words, i.e. the length of its basis\nis given by the number of Lyndon words. We\nwould like to count the number of Lyndon words\nfor index sets, where the same letters can emerge\nrepeatedly. The corresponding relation is due to\nWitt [23] and will be called 2nd Witt formula\n\u0001\nn\n!\n1X\nd\n\u03bc(d) n1 \u0001\nln (n1 , . . . , nq ) =\nnq \u0001 ,\nn\nd !... d !\nd|ni\n\n(7)\n\nPq\n\nHere \u03bc(d) denotes the\nwith n =\nk=1 nk .\nM\u00f6bius function.

An even more strict relation in the inclusive case has been conjectured by Zagier [8] and\nBroadhurst and Kreimer [25] in the case of\nmultiple Zeta\u2013values and verified up to w = 12.\nLet us come back to Eq. (7). We can draw some\nimmediate conclusions out of this relation. If the\nnumbers ni have no common divisor larger than 1,\nthe number of the basis elements compared to the\nnumber of all objects equals 1/d, where d denotes\nthe depth of the index set. In case of common\ndivisors larger than 1 we checked that the basis\nis always shorter for all depths up to d = 10,\nsee [16].\nWeight\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n\n# Sums\n2\n8\n26\n80\n242\n728\n\n# Basic Sums\n0\n1\n7\n23\n69\n183\n\nFraction\n0.0\n0.1250\n0.2692\n0.2875\n0.2851\n0.2513\n\n4. CONCLUSIONS\nThe product of finite alternating or non\u2013\nalternating harmonic sums is given by the shuffle product of harmonic sums and polynomials of\n\nharmonic sums of lower depth. These representations imply algebraic relations between the harmonic sums. If one considers all harmonic sums\nassociated to an index set {a1 , . . . , ak } one may\nexpress these sums by a number of basic sums. It\nturns out that this number is given by the 2nd\nWitt formula which counts the number of Lyndon words corresponding to the respective index\nset. The set of these Lyndon words generates in\nthis sense all harmonic sums of this class freely.\nBy solving the corresponding linear equations we\nderived the explicit representation of all harmonic\nsums up to depth d = 6 without specifying the\nindices numerically and gave all expression which\nare structurally needed to express the sums up to\nweight w = 6. The counting relations for the basis of the finite harmonic sums were given up to\ndepth d = 10. The relations derived hold likewise\nfor other mathematical objects obeying the same\nmultiplication relation or a simpler one, which is\nbeing contained, as that for harmonic polylogarithms. This is due to the fact that the relations\nderived depend on the index set and the multiplication relation but on no further properties of\nthe objects considered.\nThe ratio of the number of basic sums for a\ngiven index set and the number of all sums is\nmainly determined by the depth d rather than\nthe weight of the respective sums, due to the prefactor 1/d in the Witt formula. Modifications\noccur due to common non-trivial divisors of the\nnumbers of individual indices in the set being considered. Up to d = 10 we showed that the fraction of basic sums is always \u2264 1/d compared to all\nsums. The use of these algebraic relations leads\nto a considerable reduction in the set of functions\nneeded to express the results of higher order calculations in massless QED and QCD and related\nsubjects. For practical applications such as the\ndescription of the QCD scaling violation of the\nstructure functions in deeply inelastic scattering\nthe harmonic sums occurring in the Mellin N\nspace calculation have to be translated to x\u2013space\nby the inverse Mellin transform. For this reason\nthe respective harmonic sums have to be analytically continued in the argument N to complex\nvalues, which requires a high effort using numerical procedures. It is therefore recommended to\n\n\f4\nuse as many as possible relations between the N\nspace objects before to perform the last step only\nfor the reduced set.\nAcknowledgment.
