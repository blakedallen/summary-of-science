Some limits on the string and quantum gravity scales are also discussed.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThis paper describes a study of the process e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3(\u03b3) using data [1] and\npreliminary data [2] recorded with the L3 detector at LEP at center\u2013of\u2013mass energies (CM) from 91 GeV to 202 GeV. These processes are dominated by QED even\nat high LEP energies. Since the differential cross\u2013section is well known from QED\n[3], any deviation from this expectation hints at non\u2013standard physics processes\ncontributing to the photonic final states. Any non\u2013QED effects within the general\nframework of effective Lagrangian theory are expected to increase with CM [4]. A\ncomparison of the measured photon angular distribution with the QED expectation\nhas been used to put limits on the QED cut\u2013off parameters [5], and non\u2013standard\n\u03b3e+ e\u2212 and \u03b3\u03b3e+ e\u2212 couplings [4]. The obtained limit on the QED cut\u2013off parameters put constraints on the size of the interaction area, which can be connected\nto the size of selfgravitating particlelike structure with de Sitter vacuum core [6].\nThe other application of our results is strongly related to the study of low energy\neffects of large extra dimensions [7] in the string theory framework [8].\nWe report on the measurements of total and differential cross section of the\ne+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3(\u03b3) reaction between 1991 and 1999 [1,2]. Previous results have also\nbeen published by the other groups [9].\n\n\fTHE L3 DETECTOR AND EVENT SELECTION\nThe L3 detector Fig.1 is described in details in [10]. The individual components of the detector are the vertex silicon microstrip detector (SMD), the central\ntracking chamber (TEC) working in a time expansion mode, the electromagnetic\ncalorimeter composed on bismuth germanium oxide crystals (BGO) with a barrel\nregion (42\u25e6 < \u03b8 < 138\u25e6) an two end-caps (11\u25e6 < \u03b8 < 37\u25e6 and 143\u25e6 < \u03b8 < 169\u25e6 ),\na layer of scintillation counters used for time measurements, an uranium hadronic\ncalorimeter, and a high precision muon spectrometer. All sub-detectors are located\nin a 12m diameter magnet which provides a uniform field of 0.5 T parallel to the\nbeam direction. Forward BGO calorimeter on either side of the detector measure\nthe luminosity by detecting small\u2013angle Bhabha events. Electrons and photons are\nmeasured in the electromagnetic calorimeter with an energy resolution better than\n2% for particle energies above 1GeV. Fitting a shower shape to the signals of the\nindividual crystals of the electromagnetic bump results in a spatial resolution of\nabout 2 mm in front of the calorimeter [11]. The discrimination of electrons and\nphotons depends on the track information of the central tracking chamber. This\nchamber is divided into 24 outer sectors with 54 anode wires and 12 inner sectors\nwith 8 anode wires. It detects charged particles reliably in the polar angle range\nof 18\u25e6 < \u03b8 < 162\u25e6 . The measurement of the (r, \u03c6) coordinates is performed with a\nsingle wire resolution of about 50 \u03bcm.\nFor the event selection an ideal event of type e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3(\u03b3) has a characteristic\nsignature in the detector. Almost all of its energy is deposited in the electromagnetic calorimeter (BGO) and there is no track in the TEC Fig. 1.\nTo select an event there must be at least two photon candidates with polar angles\n\nRun #\n\nOuter Cooling Circuit\n\nCr\ne-\n\n698807\n\nEvent # 111\n\nTotal Energy : 192.13 GeV\n\nInner Cooling Circuit\nMuon Detector\n\now\nn\n\noke\nel Y\nBarr\nCoil\nMain\n\ne+\n\nDoor\n\nter\nrime\nCalo\nBGO\ntor\nc\nete\non D\nSilic\n\nter\nrime\nCalo\nron\ntor\nc\nHad\nte\nx De\nVerte\n\ny\nz\n\nFIGURE 1.

These contributions are estimated from\nMonte Carlo (MC) simulations using BHWIDE for Bhabha events and KORALZ\nfor \u03c4 events, and are found to be negligible. The acceptance is computed applying\nthe same analysis to a sample of e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3(\u03b3) events generated using an order\n\u03b13 MC generator [3,1] passed through the L3 simulation (see refs. in [1]) and\nreconstruction programs. As an example, the selection efficiencies to detect at\nleast two photons inside the fiducial volume are represented in Table 1 for four\nenergies.

No events with 5 or more photons\nhave been observed.\nTo check the consistency of data and MC, the photons in the events are sorted\nwith respect to their energy E\u03b31 > E\u03b32 > E\u03b33 and compared to MC. This is shown\nin Fig. 2 together with the distribution of the collinearity angle of first two photons,\nnormalized to 200 GeV. Data and MC are in good agreement for all energies.\nThe knowledge of the number of events, luminosity and efficiencies allows us\nto calculate the differential cross section, which is shown in Fig.3 (left side) and\nnormalized to the Born level (right side). The polar angle \u0398 of event is defined as\ncos \u0398 = 12 (| cos \u03b81 | + | cos \u03b82 |), where \u03b81 and \u03b82 are the polar angles of the two most\nenergetic photons in the event. Radiative corrections are quantified in Fig. 3 (right\nside) as the difference between the differential cross section up to O(\u03b13 ) (solid line)\nand the Born level (broken line). Excellent agreement between the data and QED\npredictions is observed up to O(\u03b13 ).\nThe observed number of events in the fiducial region 20\u25e6 < \u03b8 < 160\u25e6 corresponds\nto the total cross sections, which are presented in Table. 1. The first error is\nstatistical and the second one is systematic. The statistical error dominates in the\nmeasurement of the cross section at every energy. It has been evaluated by varying\nthe selection cuts and taking into account the finite MC statistic.\nA second independent data analysis, with similar cuts, from 90GeV to 202GeV\nwas performed measuring the differential and total cross section of the e+ e\u2212 \u2192\n\n\f\u03b3\u03b3(\u03b3) reaction. Both analysis are agreed. Fig.4 shows the total cross section of\nthis analysis compared to the QED predictions up to O(\u03b13 ) level.\n\nLIMITS ON DEVIATIONS FROM QED\nIn the case of electromagnetic interaction the process e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3(\u03b3) is ideal to\ntest the QED because it is not interfered by the Z o decay. This reaction proceeds\nvia the exchange of a virtual electron in the t \u2013 and u \u2013 channels, while the s \u2013\nchannel is forbidden due to the angular momentum conservation.\nThe differential cross section for the process e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 in the relativistic limit\nof lower order QED is given by [12]:\nd\u03c3\nd\u03a9\n\n!\n\n=\nBorn\n\n\u03b12 1 + cos2 \u03b8\n*\ns 1 \u2212 cos2 \u03b8\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b1 is the electromagnetic coupling constant and \u03b8 is the polar angle of one of\nthe photons. Since two photons can not be distinguished the event angle is defined\nas positive. A possible deviation from the QED cross section for Bhabha and M\u00f6ller\nscattering are parameterized in terms of cutoff parameters \u039b. Such parameters\ncorrespond to a short range exponential term added to the Coulomb potential.\nThis ansatz together with O(\u03b13 ) radiative corrections leads to a modification of\nthe photon angular distribution (1)\nd\u03c3\nd\u03a9\n\n!\n\n=\nQED+DEV\n\nd\u03c3\nd\u03a9\n\n!\n\n(1 + \u03b4DEV ),\n\n(2)\n\nO(\u03b13 )\n\n60\n\nL3\n\n\u03c3\u03b3\u03b3(\u03b3) (pb)\n\n50\nData\nQED\n\n40\n30\n20\n10\n125\n\n150\n\u221as (GeV)\n\n175\n\n200\n\n100\n\n125\n\n150\n\u221as (GeV)\n\n175\n\n200\n\n\u2206 \u03c3 (%)\n\n100\n10\n0\n-10\n\nFIGURE 4.

In the case of an arbitrary value of s the full equation of ref. [5] is\nused to calculate \u03b4DEV = f (me\u2217 ).\nIn the case of contact interaction \u03b4DEV reads as\n\u039b2+\n\n\u03b4DEV = s2 /(2\u03b1)(1/\u039b46 + 1/\u039b\u030346 )(1 \u2212 cos2 \u03b8)\n\n(6)\n\nAt the CM under consideration, the \u03c72 fit gives for the excited electron me\u2217 >\n343 GeV with the QED cut\u2013off parameters \u039b+ > 362 GeV and \u039b\u2212 > 250 GeV\nand for non\u2013point like coupling \u039b > 1472GeV at 95% CL (we set \u039b6 = \u039b\u03036 = \u039b).\nThe \u03c72 as a function of \u039b is shown in Fig. 5 (left side) together with differential\ncross section normalized to the QED one at the O(\u03b1)3 level (right side).

The\nlimit on the contact interaction establishes the characteristic limit of the QED size\ninteraction region to R \u223c h\u0304/(me\u2217 c) <1.17 \u00d7 10\u221217 cm. The behavior of \u03c72 as a\nfunction of \u039b shows no minimum indicating that the size of the interaction region\nmust be smaller than R. We conclude that the most stringent upper limit on scale\nof the non-point like behavior of electron comes from the contact interaction term.\nWe found also that all experimental limits on sizes of fundamental particles are\nsmaller than their Compton wavelengths. This fact has been applied to estimate\nthe lower limits on particle sizes in the model of a fundamental particle as a selfgravitating structure with de Sitter vacuum core [6].\nOur results could also be applied to study TeV scale quantum gravity [7]. It is\npossible to suggest that the fundamental scale of gravitational interaction M is as\nlow as TeV [7], whereas the observed weakness of the Newtonian coupling constant\nGN \u223c MP\u22122l is due to the existence of N large (l \u226b TeV\u22121 ) extra dimensions into\nwhich the gravitational flux can spread out. At the distances larger than the typical\nsize of these extra dimensions the gravity goes to its standard Einstein form, and\nthe usual Newtonian low can be recovered via the relation MP l = M N +2 lN [7]\nbetween Plank scale and scale M. It means that, such kind of quantum gravity\nbecomes strong at the energies M, where presumably all the interactions must\nunify, without any hierarchy problem. The phenomenological implications of large\nextra dimensions is concentrated on the effects of real and virtual graviton emission.\nThe basic assumption is, that gravitons can propagate in extra dimensions [7]. The\nquantum states of such gravitons are characterized by quantized momentum in\nthe large extra dimensions. The only known framework that allows a selfconsistent\ndescription of quantum gravity is string theory. As an essential part of the structure\n\n\fof string theory [13] is that the gravitons and the particles of standard model must\nhave an extended structure. This means that, there will be additional modifications\nof standard model amplitudes due to string excitations which can compete with or\neven overwhelm the modifications due to graviton exchange [8]. An important\neffects of simple model of string theory with large extra dimensions [8] come from\nthe exchange of string Regge (SR) excitations of standard particles. In standard\nmodel scattering processes, contact interactions due to SR exchange produce their\nown characteristic effects in differential cross section, and these effects typically\ndominate the effects due to Kaluza \u2013 Klein (KK) exchange [7]. The SR excitation\neffects can be visible as contact interactions [8] well below the string scale MS . The\ndeviation from the standard model, we investigated, has been performed in the\nterms of Drell's parameterization (5). Actually, this parameterization is applicable\nto any beyond standard model at short distances. Thus, from the comparison\nof string theory result [8] to the (5) the following identification can be deduced:\n\u0010\n\n\u00111/4\n\n\u039b+ = \u03c0122\nMS . Our result \u039b+ > 415 GeV corresponds to MS > 396 GeV at\n95% C.L. Using the connection between string scale and quantum gravity scale M\n[8] we find M > 1188 GeV.\n\nREFERENCES\n1.
