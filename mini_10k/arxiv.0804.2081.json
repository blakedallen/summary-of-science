This gate is\nused to realise p-n-p structures where the conducting properties of chiral carriers are studied. The\nband profile of the structures is calculated taking into account the specifics of the graphene density\nof states and is used to find the resistance of the p-n junctions expected for chiral carriers. We show\nthat ballistic p-n junctions have larger resistance than diffusive ones. This is caused by suppressed\ntransmission of chiral carriers at angles away from the normal to the junction.\n\nGraphene, a monolayer of carbon atoms, is a new twodimensional system [1] with unusual properties: the gapless energy spectrum of electrons and holes is linear, and\nthese carriers are chiral. It is the chirality that suppresses\nthe backscattering of carriers [2] and allows them to penetrate through potential barriers without reflection (the\nKlein paradox [3]). The theory of ballistic graphene p-n\njunctions [4] predicts that the carriers propagate through\nthe barrier without scattering if their angle of incidence is\n0\u25e6 (with respect to the normal) and are partially reflected\nat other angles. This angular selectivity of the carriers\ndetermines the resistance of a ballistic p-n junction.\nTo realise ballistic transport through a graphene p-n\njunction, the mean free path of carriers l has to be larger\nthan the characteristic length of the junction 2t. A number of intriguing phenomena, such as small-field positive\nmagnetoresistance [4] and oscillating transmission probability [3], can be observed in a ballistic p-n-p structure\nwhere the total length (two junctions plus the n-region) is\nsmaller than l. Ballistic p-n and p-n-p structures can also\nbe important for a number of potential applications: for\nexample, graphene lenses [5] and filter circuits [3] where\nthe electrical current of chiral carriers is focused on or\ndirected to a desired contact. Therefore, exploring the\nways of producing high-mobility p-n-p graphene structures with large l and understanding the mechanisms of\ncarrier propagation through them is an important task.\nGraphene flakes obtained by mechanical exfoliation\n[1] are conventionally deposited on a SiO2 /Si substrate\nwhere the conducting n-Si layer forms a (back) gate acting on the whole flake. Inversion of the type of carrier\nin a part of graphene flake has been recently achieved by\nusing an additional (top) gate which is positioned above\nthe graphene layer [6, 7, 8, 9]. In the p-n junctions fabricated so far, the top gate rests on an insulating layer\nthat can decrease the mobility of graphene carriers under it [6] and hinder the realisation of ballistic p-n and\np-n-p structures. We avoid this problem by fabricating\np-n-p graphene structures using suspended 'air-bridge'\ntop gates. (Similar designs were used earlier in semiconductor nanostructures [10, 11].) The mobility of carriers\nunder the top gate in such structures is the same as in\n\nthe rest of the graphene layer.\nThe theory of ballistic graphene p-n junctions [4] considers a 'smooth' junction, 2kF t \u001d 1, where kF is the\nFermi wave vector of the particles and 2t is the tunneling\ndistance of the carriers. The transmission probability of\nsuch a junction as a function of the angle of incidence \u03b8\n(with respect to the normal to the junction) is given by\n2\n\n2\n\nw(\u03b8) = e\u2212\u03c0~vF kF sin\n\n\u03b8/F\n\n2\n\n= e\u2212\u03c0~vF ky /F .\n\n(1)\n\nHere, vF =106 ms\u22121 is the Fermi velocity of carriers and\nF/e is the electric field in the barrier which is assumed\nto be constant over the tunneling distance so that the\npotential \u03c6(x) = F x/e. The term ky is the component\nof the wavevector parallel to the junction, ky = \u03c0n/W ,\nn = 1, 2, . . ., where W is the width of the barrier. Therefore, the transmission of chiral carriers is restricted to\nthe angles \u03b8 \u2264 \u03b8c ' (F/\u03c0~vF kF2 )1/2 or, equivalently, the\ntransverse momentum values ky \u2264 (F/\u03c0~vF )1/2 . The\nconductance of a ballistic junction is then [4]\n\u22121\nRpn\n=\n\n4e2 W kF\n\u2248\nh 2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n+\u03c0\n2\n\n\u2212\u03c0\n2\n\n4e2 X\nw(ky )\nh n\n\n2e2\nw(\u03b8) cos \u03b8 d\u03b8 \u2248\nW\n\u03c0h\n\n(2)\nr\n\nF\n.\n~vF\n\nFor the calculation of the resistance of a graphene pn junction it is important to know accurately the electric field at the p-n boundary, which can be much larger\nthan that in the rest of the barrier [12]. This is caused\nby poor screening near the point of electro-neutrality\n(the Dirac point) where the density of carrier states decreases to zero. Therefore, to find the expected resistance of ballistic p-n junctions in our samples, we have\ncomputed the potential profile of the experimental p-np structures. This is done for different combinations of\nthe back and top gate voltages, taking into account the\ndensity of states in graphene which changes linearly with\nenergy.\nTo fabricate ballistic p-n junctions, one positions the\ntop gate close to graphene, which increases the field\nF and decreases the tunneling distance t(ky , F ) =\n~vF ky /F . In addition, the Fermi wavelength increases\n\n\f2\nwhen the electron diffusively approaches the junction,\nup to the distance \u223c l/2 from its centre when it passes\nthrough it ballistically. As a result, the length of the\njunction 2t can become comparable to the wavelength,\nand the assumption of [4] of a smooth barrier not applicable. To examine the validity of this approximation\nfor our structures, we have also found the transmission\nprobability w(\u03b8) by solving the Dirac equation numerically [13], using the calculated potential profile \u03c6(x).\nThis calculated potential \u03c6(x) allows us to determine\nthe resistance of the p-n-p structure expected for diffusive propagation of carriers (without taking into account\ntheir chirality) and to compare the result with experiment. The required resistivity \u03c1(\u03c6) of the sample at\ndifferent Fermi energies is found from the resistance as\na function of back-gate voltage Vbg (at top-gate voltage\nVtg = 0).\nHere, we present the results for three samples with different mobilities. The sample with the smallest mean\nfree path has a resistance in the p-n-p regime which is\nin agreement with the diffusive model, while the highermobility samples (with ballistic transport through the\np-n junctions) show an enhanced value of the resistance,\nwhich agrees with the result we expect for the chiral carriers.\ny\nx\n\n3mm\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\nFIG. 1: (a) Three stages of the air-bridge fabrication: electron beam lithography with two exposure doses; development,\nand deposition of the metal film.

(d) Positions of the resistance maxima at different Vbg , Vtg , with different regimes of\nthe device operation indicated, sample S1.\n\nTo fabricate the p-n-p structures, we have chosen\ngraphene flakes of rectangular geometry on SiO2 /Si substrates with a 300 nm oxide layer. The samples have the\nfollowing dimensions, in \u03bcm: L=5, W =0.24 (sample S1);\nL=4.3, W =0.6 (sample S2) and L=1.45, W =0.15 (sample S3). The mobility of these samples outside the region\nof electro-neutrality (at a carrier density of 3\u00d71011 cm\u22122 )\nis 13, 11 and 6 \u00d7103 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121 , respectively. The procedure of the top gate fabrication is illustrated in Fig. 1(a).\nTwo layers of PMMA with different molecular weights are\nspun on the flake: a soft resist (495K) on top of a hard\nresist (950K). They were then patterned using 10 kV ebeam lithography (to achieve larger undercut in the top\nPMMA layer). Two different exposure doses were used\nin the areas of the span and pillars of the bridge, while\nthe area outside the bridge was not exposed. The dose\nin the span is just enough to expose the soft resist, but\ntoo small to affect the underlying hard layer. Both layers are exposed at a larger dose in the areas of the pillars\n(and contacts). The structures are then developed and\ncovered with 5/250 nm of Cr/Au. The 'lift off' removes\nPMMA leaving the bridge with a span up to 2 \u03bcm supported by two pillars. Figure 1(b) shows an SEM image\nof sample S2 with a bridge top gate and two Ohmic contacts. The mean free path in our samples l \u2248 45\u2212100 nm\nand the distance between the top gate and the flakes is\n130\u2013210 nm. In the attempt to produce a p-n-p structure with ballistic properties, the top gate is made short\nin the direction of the current flow: 100\u2013170 nm.\nTwo-terminal measurements of R(Vbg ) in quantising\nmagnetic fields have confirmed that we are dealing with\nsingle-layer graphene. The grey-scale plot in Fig. 1(c)\nshows the shift with magnetic field of two resistance\npeaks corresponding to the first electron and hole Landau levels. In this experiment, the carrier concentration was varied by the back gate voltage: n/Vbg =\n7.2 \u00d7 1010 cm\u22122 V\u22121 (the relation from the known capacitance of the structure with a 300 nm SiO2 layer). A\npositive (negative) Vbg induces electrons (holes) in the\ngraphene layer, and the 0th Landau level (the bright\nvertical line) corresponds to the Dirac point. The dotted lines show the position of the 1st Landau level of\nelectrons and holes in accordance with the filling factor\n\u03bd = 4eBn/h = \u00b11 [14, 15].\nFigure 1(d) shows that, by changing the combination\nof the voltages on the back gate and top gate, one can\nget different regimes of the operation of the device, with\nboth p-n-p and n-p-n modes available. Different regions\nare separated by the resistance peaks corresponding to\nthe Dirac points under the top gate (steep line) and back\ngate (almost horizontal line). The slope dVbg /dVtg of\nthe steep line (from 0.24 to 0.4 in our samples) gives the\nefficiency of top-gate control with respect to that of the\nback gate.\nFigure 2(a) shows R(Vbg ) at Vtg = 0, where the peak\ncorresponds to the Dirac point. Figure 2(b-d) shows how\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 2: (a) Resistivity of the three samples as a function\nof the back-gate voltage, at Vtg = 0. Points indicate the\nfixed values of Vbg where the top-gate voltage was swept to\nproduce p-n-p junctions. (b) The resistance of sample S1\nas a function of top-gate voltage at different Vbg . (c,d) The\nresistance as a function of top-gate voltage at different Vbg of\nsamples S2 and S3, respectively. Points show the results of\nthe calculations of the expected resistance assuming diffusive\ntransport of carriers. (Dashed lines in b,c are guides to the\neye.)\n\nthe resistance of the samples changes (for fixed Vbg values\nshown by points in Fig. 2(a)) when a top-gate voltage is\napplied. When the main part of the sample outside the\ntop gate is p-type, applying a negative Vtg decreases the\nresistance due to the increase of the hole density under\nthe top gate. Applying a positive Vtg increases the resistance of the samples, first because of the depletion\nof electrons under the top gate and then because of inversion of the sign of carriers and formation of a p-n-p\nstructure.\nAt the onset of the formation of the p-n junction, the\nresistance shows reproducible oscillations as a function of\nVtg . They survive at high temperatures, which strongly\nsuggests that they can be due to the oscillations of the\ntransmission coefficient caused by interference of chiral\ncarriers [3] within a ballistic p-n-p structure. However,\nthis effect has to be separated from mesoscopic fluctuations of resistance [16] that can be enhanced in the Dirac\npoints of the p-n junctions. (We will discuss the separation of these effects elsewhere [17].) Here, we consider the average values of the resistance and present the\nresults obtained in a higher temperature range (T =50\u2013\n77 K) where the effect of the mesoscopic fluctuations is\nless important.\n\nFIG. 3: (a) Geometry of the top-gated structure used in the\ncalculations of the potential profile along the flake, sample\nS1. (b,c,d) Potential profile of the top-gated samples S1, S2\nand S3 along the barrier at different Vtg for a fixed Vbg . The\ncurves correspond to the position of the Dirac point and zero\nis the Fermi level. The bars show the mean free path l.\n\nThe band-structure profile along the p-n-p structure\nat different Vtg is calculated numerically for the geometry shown in Fig. 3(a), by solving the two-dimensional\nLaplace equation with the potentials of the two gates\nas boundary conditions. The presence of the flake is\nincluded as an additional boundary condition on the\njump of the normal component of the displacement\nfield at the flake: \u2206Dn = en(x), where n(x) is carrier concentration along the sample. Taking the Fermi\nlevel as zero and using the linear energy dependence of\nthe density of states in graphene, \u03bd(E) = 2E/\u03c0~2 vF2 ,\none gets the relation between the carrier concentration\nalong the junction n(x) and the electrostatic potential: n(x) = sgn(\u03c6)e2 \u03c62 (x)/\u03c0(~vF )2 , where sgn(\u03c6) reflects the fact that carriers can be both electrons and\nholes depending on the position of the Dirac point with\nrespect to the Fermi level. Examples of such calculations\nfor the three samples are shown in Fig. 3(b-d), where indeed one can see a rapid increase of the electric field at\nthe boundaries between p- and n-regions considered in\n[12]: F = (0.8 \u2212 2.4) \u00d7 106 eV/m.\nWe use the 'calibration' curves R(Vbg ) in Fig. 2(a) to\nfind the resistivity of the flake at different Fermi energies (different electrostatic potentials if the Fermi level is\ntaken as zero). We used the relation between Vbg and the\nelectrostatic potential \u03c6 known from the capacitance\nbep\ntween the flake and the back gate: \u03c6(mV) = 31 Vbg (V).\nWith the calculated distribution of the potential along\n\n\f4\np\n\nE\n\nn\nkx\n\nq\nky\n\nky\nkF\n\nkx\n\nl\n2t\n\nn\nE\n\np\n\np\n\nx\n\n2t\n\nFIG. 4: (a) Momentum of the electron approaching the junction at an angle \u03b8.

One adjustable parameter, the\ndistance h between the top gate and the graphene flake,\nwas used in plotting the calculated values: h =140, 210\nand 130 nm for samples S1, S2 and S3, respectively. The\nobtained values are close to those expected from the fabrication process and agree with observed efficiency of the\ntop gate, Fig. 2(d). With larger positive Vtg and formation of the p-n-p structures, samples S1 and S2 show\nsignificantly larger values of the resistance than expected\nfrom the diffusive model: \u2206R '4 and 2 kOhm, respectively. However, the narrowest sample S3 with the lowest\nmobility shows agreement with the diffusive model in the\nwhole range of Vtg , Fig. 2(d).\nTo explain these observations, we find the characteristic thickness of the p-n junctions in the three samples and compare it with the mean free path l. According to [4], the reason for the enhanced resistance\nof a junction is the decrease of the transmission when\nthe electron approaches the junction at an angle \u03b8 6= 0,\nFig. 4(a). Conservation of the parallel component of the\nmomentum ky produces a gap in the energy spectrum\nE(kx ) for the motion across the junction, Fig. 4(b). The\ndistance 2t is then defined as the classically inaccessible region which requires electrons to tunnel along it,\nFig. 4(c): t = ~vF kF sin \u03b8/F . The critical angle for car-\n\nrier transmission in the three samples varies in the range\n\u03b8c = 20 \u2212 30\u25e6 , assuming the length of the ballistic pn junction to be l and taking the kF -value at a point\nx = \u2212l/2 from the barrier, Fig. 4(a). As the tunneling\ndistance 2t depends on the angle of incidence, we take for\na typical value of the barrier thickness 2t(2\u03b8c ) '40 nm in\nour samples.\nThe mean free path l has been found using R(Vbg ) of\na uniform sample at Vtg = 0, Fig. 2(a), and the relation \u03c3 = 2e2 (kF l)/h. The value of l weakly depends on\nVbg , and when extrapolated to the Dirac point (Vbg = 0\nfor an undoped sample) gives l ' 100, 75 and 45 nm,\nrespectively, for samples S1, S2 and S3. Comparing the\ntunnelling length with the mean free path shows that the\np-n junctions in S1 and S2 are ballistic (l \u001d 2t), while in\nS3 they are less ballistic (l \u223c 2t). This can explain the\nagreement of the resistance of S3 with the result of the\ndiffusive model in Fig. 2(d).\nTo find the expected resistance Rpn of ballistic pn junction in samples S1 and S2 and compare it with\nthe observed difference \u2206R in Fig. 2, we first assume a\nsmooth potential barrier, 2kF t \u001d 1, and by using the\ncalculated value of electric field F we get the tunneling\nprobability w(\u03b8) from Eq. 1. Equation 2 is then used to\nobtain the resistance of the ballistic p-n junction. We\nhave found that using summation rather than integration is more appropriate in our case, as samples S1 and\nS2 have less than 12 modes (the narrowest sample S3 has\nonly three modes). The value of the Fermi momentum\nkF in these calculations is taken at a distance l/2 from\nthe barrier using the values of the mean free path found\nabove; however, the result for Rpn hardly changes if the\nvalue of l is varied by two times either way. This is clear\nas the tunneling probability w(\u03b8) in Eq. 1 depends only\non ky which takes specific, quantised values ky = \u03c0n/W .\nThe obtained values are Rpn =5 and 2 kOhm for samples\nS1 (at Vbg = \u22129 V, Vtg = 40 V) and S2 (at Vbg = \u22124 V,\nVtg = 30 V).\nTaking into account the Fermi wavelength at the distance l/2 from the barrier, we see that 2kF t '2 for the\nthree samples. To examine the applicability of a smoothbarrier approximation for this (not too large) value of\n2kF t, we have calculated w(\u03b8) directly using numerical\nmethods [13] and compared the result with that obtained\nfrom Eq. 1. It shows less than 5% difference from the\nvalue of Rpn calculated above and a significantly larger\nresistance than the one expected for a sharp, rectangular\nbarrier where w(\u03b8) = cos2 \u03b8 [4].\nIn experiment, it is not the resistance of an individual ballistic p-n junction which is measured but the resistance of the whole p-n-p structure. It can be different depending on whether its middle, n-region is long or\nshort compared with l (i.e., diffusive or ballistic). For a\ndiffusive n-region with three independent contributions\n(two junctions and middle region) Rpnp \u2265 2Rpn , while\nfor a ballistic n-region, Rpnp ' Rpn [4]. The resistance\n\n\f5\nof a ballistic p-n-p structure should not increase with\naddition of another junction as the electrons approaching the second junction have already been selected by\nthe first junction within the critical angle \u03b8c . Therefore,\nthey all will have high transmission probability w(\u03b8) going through the second junction.\nFigure 2(b,c) shows clearly that the resistance of S1\nand S2 is larger than that expected in the diffusive model\nby \u2206R, because of the ballistic transport of chiral carriers\nthrough two p-n junctions. To find their resistance, we\nassume that they are independent; that is, the n-region\nis diffusive. Then the observed difference \u2206R = 2(Rpn \u2212\nD\nD\nRpn\n), where Rpn\nis the resistance of the diffusive p-n\njunction on the length l which was taken into account\nin the diffusive-model calculation shown in Fig. 2. With\nD\nthe values l =100 and 75 nm, one finds that Rpn\n=2 and\n0.6 kOhm for samples S1 and S2, respectively. This gives\nthe corresponding resistance of the ballistic p-n junction\nRpn =4 and 1.6 kOhm, which is close to the expected\nvalues of 5 and 2 kOhm. (Even better agreement, within\n10%, is achieved if another quantisation rule for graphene\nis used [18]: ky = \u03c0(n + 1/2)/W , n = 0, 1, 2, . . .) The\nassumption of the diffusive nature of the n-region at large\nVtg is confirmed by Fig. 3, where the whole p-n-p region\nis seen to be larger than the mean free path. However,\nnear the onset of the p-n junctions, at small Vtg , the p-n-p\nregion is much shorter and can be fully ballistic.\nIn conclusion, we have fabricated p-n-p and n-p-n\ngraphene structures using non-perturbative 'air-bridge'\ntop gates. The chiral nature of charge carriers in\ngraphene has been directly demonstrated by detecting\nan increase of the resistance of p-n junctions caused by\ntheir selective effect on the propagation of chiral particles. Our detailed analysis shows that individual p-n\njunctions are ballistic and that a ballistic p-n-p structure\ncan be realised using this fabrication method.\nWe are grateful to V. Cheianov, V.
