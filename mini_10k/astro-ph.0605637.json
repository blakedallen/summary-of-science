Introduction\nThe observed discrepancy between the dynamical mass and the luminous mass of\nbounded astrophysical systems is generally attributed to the existence of an invisible\nform of matter, coined as the missing mass or dark matter. The nature of the dark\nmatter particles is unknown but extensions of the standard model of particle physics\nprovide a number of candidates [1]. The dark matter triggers the formation of largescale structures by gravitational collapse and predicts the scale-dependence of density\nfluctuations. Simulations suggest some universal dark matter density profile around\nordinary matter distributions [2]. An important characteristic of dark matter, required\nby the necessity of clustering matter on small scales, is that it should be cold or nonrelativistic at the epoch of the galaxy formation. However, the dark matter hypothesis\nhas some difficulties [3] at explaining naturally the flat rotation curves of galaxies, one\nof the most persuasive evidence for the existence of dark matter, and the Tully-Fisher\nempirical relation [4] between the observed luminosity and the asymptotic rotation\nvelocity of spiral galaxies.\nOn the other hand, the modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) has been proposed\nby Milgrom [5, 6, 7] as an alternative to the dark matter paradigm. It imputes the\nmass discrepancy not to the presence of some additional non-baryonic matter, but to\nfailure of the Newtonian law of gravity in an appropriate regime - a drastic change of\nparadigm. MOND involves a single parameter a0 being a constant acceleration scale,\nwhich delineates the specific MOND regime, corresponding to accelerations much smaller\nthan a0 , from the Newtonian regime, for which the accelerations are much larger. Several\nrelativistic extensions of MOND, assuming the existence of extra fields associated with\ngravity, besides the spin-2 metric field of general relativity, have been proposed [13, 14].\nSuch extensions have culminated in the scalar-vector-tensor theory of Bekenstein and\nSanders [15, 16, 17].\nMOND has been very successful at fitting the flat rotation curves of galaxies, and\nat recovering naturally the Tully-Fisher relation (see [8, 9, 10, 11, 12] for reviews).\nIntriguingly, the numerical value of a0 that fits the data is close to the Hubble scale,\na0 \u2248 c H0 . MOND may have also some observational problems: There are some\ncounter-examples of galaxies where MOND does not seem to account for the observed\nkinematics [18], and, most importantly, the mass discrepancy at the scale of clusters of\ngalaxies is not entirely explained by MOND [19, 20].\nIn this article and the next one [21] (hereafter paper II), we take the view that\nMOND does not represent a violation of the fundamental law of gravity, but, rather,\nprovides us with an important hint on the (probably unorthodox) nature of the elusive\ndark matter. More precisely, we interpret the phenomenology behind MOND as resulting\nfrom an effect of gravitational polarization, of some cosmic fluid made of dipole moments,\nand representing a new form of dark matter. The dipole moments get aligned in the\ngravitational field produced by ordinary masses, thereby enhancing the magnitude of\nthe field and yielding MOND. Such effect is the gravitational analogue of the usual\n\n\fGravitational polarization\n\n3\n\nelectrostatic effect, of polarization of a dielectic medium in an applied electric field [22].\nIn the present paper we imagine, as a model for the dipole, a doublet of particles,\none having a positive gravitational mass, the other having a negative and opposite\ngravitational mass, and with both particles being endowed with positive inertial masses.\nThe gravitational behavior involving masses of this type is governed by a negative\nCoulomb law - like masses attract and unlike masses repel [23]. As a result the dipole\nmoment cannot be stable: Even if we neglect the repulsive gravitational force between\nthe two particles, they will accelerate apart from each other in an exterior gravitational\nfield produced by ordinary matter. We shall therefore invoke an internal force, of nongravitational origin, between the two particles constituting the dipole, to bound them\nin a gravitational field. The MOND acceleration scale a0 will appear to be related to\nthe properties of this internal \"microscopic\" force at short distances. We find that the\nmotion of the dipolar particles violates the equivalence principle, and is driven by the\ntidal gravitational field of ordinary matter, rather than the gravitational field itself. In\nthis sense the dark matter is only weakly influenced by the distribution of ordinary\nmatter.\nSummarizing, in our approach the dark matter is described by a \"digravitational\"\nmedium, which is subject to polarization in a gravitational field, and is otherwise\nessentially static (an \"ether\"). An alternative interpretation of this dark matter is by\nthe gravitational analogue of a plasma in electromagnetism, i.e. composed of positive\nand negative gravitational masses, and oscillating at the natural plasma frequency. In\na gravitational field the mean position of the masses is displaced from equilibrium and\nthe plasma acquires a dipolar polarization. The observational predictions of the present\n(non-relativistic) model are the same as for MOND.\nIn paper II we shall propose a relativistic model of dipolar particles, based on an\naction principle in general relativity. This model will be consistent with the equivalence\nprinciple, and as a result the dynamics of dipolar particles, even in the non-relativistic\nlimit, will be different from that of the present quasi-Newtonian model. The present\npaper and paper II provide two distinct models, both of them suggest a close connection\nbetween the phenomenology of MOND and some form of gravitationally polarized\ndipolar dark matter.\nSection 2 investigates the formal analogy between the MOND equation and the\nelectrostatics of non-linear media. Sections 3 and 4 introduce a microscopic quasiNewtonian description of the gravitational dipole moment. In Sec. 5 we derive the\nexpression of the non-gravitational internal force in the MOND regime. In Sec. 6 we\npresent an alternative though equivalent formulation of the dipolar medium in terms of\na polarized gravitational plasma.\n\n\fGravitational polarization\n\n4\n\n2. Analogy with electrostatics\nThe MOND equation, in the variant derivable from a non-relativistic Lagrangian [13],\ntakes the form of the modified Poisson equation\n\u0014 \u0012 \u0013 \u0015\ng\n(1)\n\u2202i \u03bc\ng i = \u22124\u03c0 G \u03c1 ,\na0\n\nwhere \u03c1 denotes the density of ordinary matter, g i = \u2202i U is the gravitational field in the\nnon-relativistic limit (so that ai = g i is the acceleration of ordinary matter), and U is the\ngravitational potential.\u2021 In Eq. (1) the Milgrom function \u03bc depends on the ratio g/a0 ,\nwhere g = |g i | is the norm of the gravitational field, and a0 is the constant acceleration\nscale. The MOND regime corresponds to the limit of weak gravity, much below the\nscale a0 , i.e. g \u226a a0 ; in this limiting regime we have \u03bc(g/a0 ) \u2248 g/a0 [5, 6, 7]. When\ng \u226b a0 , the function \u03bc(g/a0) asymptotes to one, and we recover the usual Newtonian\nlaw. Sometimes we shall consider the formal \"Newtonian\" limit g \u2192 \u221e; however\nwe always assume that the gravitational field is non-relativistic. Various forms of the\nfunction \u03bc have been proposed (cf. [24]), but most of them appear to be rather ad hoc.\nTaking the MOND equation (1) at face, we notice a striking analogy with the usual\nequation of electrostatics describing the electric field inside a dielectric medium, namely\n\u2202i D i = \u03c1e , where the electric induction D i is proportional to the electric field E i (at\nleast for not too large electric fields): D i = \u03bce \u03b50 E i . Here \u03bce = 1 + \u03c7e is the dielectric\ncoefficient, and \u03c7e denotes the electric susceptibility of the dielectric medium, which\ndepends on the detailed microscopic properties of the medium (see e.g. [22]). In nonlinear media the susceptibility is a function of the norm of the electric field, \u03c7e (E) with\nE = |E i |. The electric polarization is proportional to the electric field, and is given by\n\u03a0ie = \u03c7e \u03b50 E i . The density of electric charge due to the polarization is \u03c1pol\n= \u2212\u2202i \u03a0ie .\ne\nGenerically we have \u03c7e > 0, which corresponds to screening of electric charges by the\npolarization charges, and reduction of the electric field inside the dielectric.\nIn keeping with this analogy, let us interpret the MOND function \u03bc entering Eq. (1)\nas a \"digravitational\" coefficient, and write\n\u03bc = 1 + \u03c7,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03c7 would be a coefficient of \"gravitational susceptibility\", parametrizing the\nrelation between some \"gravitational polarization\", say \u03a0i , and the gravitational field:\n\u03c7 i\ng .\n(3)\n\u03a0i = \u2212\n4\u03c0 G\nSince as we have seen the MOND function (2) depends on the magnitude of the\ngravitational field, \u03bc(g/a0 ), the same is true of the so defined gravitational susceptibility,\n\u03c7(g/a0 ), in close analogy with the electrostatics of non-linear media. Hence we expect\nthat \u03c7 should characterize the response of some non-linear digravitational medium to\n\u2021 Spatial indices i, j are raised and lowered using the Euclidean metric \u03b4ij ; the summation convention\nis used throughout.\n\n\fGravitational polarization\n\n5\n\nan applied gravitational field. The mass density associated with the polarization would\nthen be given by the same formula as in electrostatics,\n\u03c1pol = \u2212\u2202i \u03a0i .\n\n(4)\n\nWith those notations Eq. (1) can be rewritten as\n\u2206U = \u22124\u03c0 G (\u03c1 + \u03c1pol ) .\n\n(5)\n\nIn such rewriting of MOND, we see that the Newtonian law of gravity is not violated,\nbut, rather, we are postulating the existence of a new form of matter, to be called dark\nmatter, and which contributes in the normal way to the right-hand-side (RHS) of the\nPoisson equation (5). The dark matter consists of polarization masses with volume\ndensity \u03c1pol given by (4).\n3. Sign of the susceptibility coefficient\nFor the moment we have restated the MOND equation in the form (4)\u2013(5) and proposed\na formal interpretation. To check this interpretation, let us view the digravitational\nmedium as consisting of individual dipole moments \u03c0 i with number density n, so that\nthe polarization vector reads\n\u03a0i = n \u03c0 i .\n\n(6)\n\nWe suppose that the dipoles are made of a doublet of sub-particles, one with positive\nmass +m and one with negative mass \u2212m, the masses which we are referring here\nare the gravitational masses of these particles, i.e. the gravitational analogue of the\nelectric charges, mg = \u00b1m. Clearly the exotic nature of this dark matter shows up here,\nwhen we suggest the notion of negative gravitational masses. If the two masses \u00b1m are\nseparated by the spatial vector di , pointing in the direction of the positive mass, the\ndipole moment is\n\u03c0 i = m di .\n\n(7)\n\nLet us further suppose that the two sub-particles are endowed with inertial masses which\nare positive, and given by mi = m. The dipole moment thus consists of an ordinary\nparticle, say (mi , mg ) = (m, m), associated with an exotic particle, (mi , mg ) = (m, \u2212m).\nThe ordinary particle will always be attracted by an external mass distribution\nmade of ordinary matter; however, the other particle (mi , mg ) = (m, \u2212m) will always\nbe repelled by the same external mass. In addition the two sub-particles will repel each\nother. We see therefore that the gravitational dipole is unstable, and we shall invoke\na non-gravitational force to sustain it. We also expect that the external gravitational\nfield will exert a torque on the dipole moment in such a way that its orientation has\nthe positive mass +m oriented in the direction of the external mass, and the negative\nmass \u2212m oriented in the opposite direction. We thus find that \u03c0 i and \u03a0i should\nboth point towards the external mass, i.e. be oriented in the same direction as the\n\n\fGravitational polarization\n\n6\n\nexternal gravitational field g i . From Eq. (3) we therefore conclude that the susceptibility\ncoefficient \u03c7, in the gravitational case, must be negative:\n\u03c7 < 0.\n\n(8)\n\nThis corresponds to an \"anti-screening\" of the ordinary mass by the polarization masses,\nand enhancement of the gravitational field in the presence of the digravitational medium.\nThis simply results from the fact that, in contrast to electrostatics, alike gravitational\ncharges or masses always attract. The result (8) is nicely compatible with the prediction\nof MOND; indeed we have 0 \u2264 \u03bc < 1 in a straightforward interpolation between the\nMOND and Newtonian regimes, hence \u22121 \u2264 \u03c7 < 0. The stronger gravitational field\npredicted by MOND may thus be naturally interpreted by a process of anti-screening\nby polarization masses.\n4. Microscopic model for the dipole\nTo give more substance to the model, suppose that some interaction F i between the\ntwo constituents of the dipole is at work, and let the dipole moment be embedded\ninto the gravitational field g i = \u2202i U. The equations of motion of the sub-particles\n(mi , mg ) = (m, m) and (m, \u2212m), having positions xi+ and xi\u2212 respectively, are\n\nd2 xi+\n= m g i (x+ ) \u2212 F i (x+ \u2212 x\u2212 ) ,\n(9)\ndt2\nd2 xi\u2212\n= \u2212 m g i (x\u2212 ) + F i (x+ \u2212 x\u2212 ) .\n(10)\nm\n2\ndt\nThe internal force F i is proportional to the relative separation vector di = xi+ \u2212 xi\u2212 ,\nnamely\nm\n\ndi\n.\n(11)\nd\nThe norm of F i is a function of the separation distance, F = F (d) where d = |xi+ \u2212 xi\u2212 |,\nand is expected to also depend on the magnitude of the gravitational field, g = |g i |.\nThe force F i is assumed to be attractive, F > 0 (hence it is non-gravitational). This\nforce is indispensable if we are looking for configurations in which the constituents of\nthe dipole remain at constant distance from each other. For simplicity, we suppose that\nthe gravitational force between the two sub-particles, i.e. Fg = \u2212G m2 /d2 , which is\nrepulsive, is negligible or included into the definition of F .\nWe introduce next the centre of inertial masses, xi = (xi+ + xi\u2212 )/2, and transform\nthe system of equations (9)\u2013(10) into an equation of motion for the \"dipolar particle\",\nFi = F\n\n\u0001\nd2 xi\nj\n2\n=\n\u03c0\n\u2202\nU\n+\nO\nd\n,\nij\ndt2\nand an evolution equation for the dipole moment,\n\u0001\nd2 \u03c0 i\n= 2m g i \u2212 2F i + O d2 .\n2\ndt\n2m\n\n(12)\n\n(13)\n\n\fGravitational polarization\n\n7\n\nIn both Eqs. (12) and (13) we neglect terms of the order of the square of the separation\ndistance d, assuming that d \u226a |xi |. In the RHS of (12)\u2013(13), g i and \u2202ij U are evaluated\nat the position of the center-of-mass xi . The torque produced by the forces acting on\nthe two sub-particles in the RHS of (9)\u2013(10) is given by\nC i = \u03b5ijk \u03c0 j g k + O(d2 ) .\n\n(14)\n\nThis torque will tend to align the dipole moment with (and in the same direction of)\nthe gravitational field.\nThe prominent feature of the equation of motion (12) is the violation of the\nequivalence principle by the dipolar particle, as a result of the fact that the particle's\ninertial mass is 2m while its gravitational mass is zero. Note that Eq. (12) has a structure\ndifferent from the equation we obtain in the non-relativistic limit of the relativistic model\nof paper II - indeed, contrarily to the present quasi-Newtonian model, the relativistic\nmodel is consistent with the equivalence principle (see paper II for discussion). While the\ninertial and passive/active gravitational masses of the dipolar particle are given here by\nMi = 2m and Mp = Ma = 0, the relativistic model of paper II will have Mi = Mp = 2m\nand Ma = O(c\u22122 ) in the non-relativistic limit c \u2192 \u221e. This represents a fundamental\ndifference between the two models. In addition, of course, since the present model is\nNewtonian it does not a priori allow (in contrast to paper II) to answer questions related\nto cosmology or the motion of relativistic particles. However, despite these differences,\nwe shall recover in paper II the main characteristics of the mechanism of gravitational\npolarization.\nFrom Eq. (12) the dipolar particle is expected to accelerate slowly in a given\ngravitational field, as compared to an ordinary particle. More precisely, we find that\nthe particle is not directly subject to the gravitational field, but, rather, to its gradient,\nnamely the tidal gravitational field \u2202ij U. In the potential U \u223c 1/R (respectively the\nMOND analogue U \u223c ln R), the acceleration is typically of the order of 1/R3 (resp.\n1/R2 ).\u00a7 The observational consequence is that the dark matter consisting of a fluid\nof dipole moments is necessarily cold, and even \"colder\" than ordinary non-relativistic\nmatter. This property may be consistent with the observation of galactic structures.\nThus, the dipolar dark matter appears as a medium whose dynamics is weakly influenced\nby the distribution of ordinary galaxies.\nOn the other hand, the evolution equation (13) shows that a situation of\nequilibrium, where the distance d between the pair of particles remains constant, is\npossible. The equilibrium is realized when the internal force F i exactly compensates for\nthe gravitational force,k\n\u0001\nF i = m g i + O d2 .\n(15)\n\u00a7 This type of coupling to the tidal gravitational field is well known; for instance it corresponds to the\nnon-relativistic limit of the coupling between the spin and the Riemann curvature tensor, for particles\nwith spin moving on an arbitrary background [25, 26].\nk In Sec. 6 we shall be more precise about what is meant by equilibrium condition; see Eq. (32).\n\n\f8\n\nGravitational polarization\n\nNote that here as everywhere else, g i represents the total gravitational field, sum of the\ncontributions due to the ordinary masses and the polarization masses. Because F i is\nproportional to di , Eq. (11), we see that when the equilibrium holds, the dipole moment\nis in the direction of the gravitational field, \u03c0 i = m di \u221d g i . The polarization vector\n\u03a0i = n \u03c0 i is aligned with the gravitational field and the medium is polarized. Hence, the\nequilibrium condition (15) provides a mechanism for verifying the crucial equation (3).\nLet us now get information on the susceptibility coefficient \u03c7 as a function of\ng = |g i |. From Eq. (3) and the relation \u03a0 = n m d [see (6)\u2013(7)], we get\n\u03c7 = \u22124\u03c0 G m n\n\nd\n.\ng\n\n(16)\n\nThe condition (15) implies that d is necessarily a function of g, say d = d(g), obtained by\ninversion of the relation F (d) = m g or, rather, since as we have seen the force should\nalso depend on g, of the relation F (d, g) = m g. Thus, \u03c7 is a certain function of g,\ndepending on the properties of the internal force F i , and we are able, in principle, to\nrelate the MOND function \u03bc = 1 + \u03c7 to the internal structure of the dipolar particles.\nWe obtain\n\u0012 \u0013\ng\nd(g)\n\u03bc\n= 1 \u2212 4\u03c0 G m n\n.\n(17)\na0\ng\nNotice that such function is expected to be a complicated function of g, because it\nis made of the inverse of F (d, g) = m g, and especially because it depends on the\nspatial distribution of the dipole moments, characterized by their number density\nn. The distribution of n is determined by the gravitational field via the equation\nof motion (12), together with the Eulerian continuity equation \u2202t n + \u2202i (nv i ) = 0,\nwhere v i = dxi /dt. However, as we have seen, the motion of the dipolar particle is\nsensitive in first approximation only to the tidal gravitational field. Thus, a reasonable\napproximation is probably to consider that the velocity field v i remains small, hence the\nnumber density n is nearly constant and uniform. In the following we shall neglect the\ntidal gravitational fields, and shall treat n as a constant.\n5. Internal force law\nIn the limit g \u2192 0, we enter the deep MOND regime - a non-linear regime characterized\nby \u03bc = g/a0 + O(g 2 ).\u00b6 Comparing with Eq. (17), we deduce that the dipole separation\nd should behave in terms of the gravitational field in the MOND regime like\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0001\ng\ng\n2\n1\u2212\n.\n(18)\n+O g\nd=\n4\u03c0 G m n\na0\nThus, in first approximation, d is found to be proportional to the gravitational field\n(recall that n is assumed to be constant); this means, using F = m g, that the force\n\u00b6 For simplicity we assume a power-law expansion when g \u2192 0.\n\n\fGravitational polarization\n\n9\n\nmust be dominantly proportional to d. More precisely, we find that the force law F (d)\nthat is necessary to account for the MOND phenomenology is\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0001\n4\u03c0 G m n\n2\n2\nd+O d\n.\n(19)\nF (d) = 4\u03c0 G m n d 1 +\na0\n\nInterestingly, this force becomes weaker when the particles constituting the dipole\nmoment get closer. As we see from (19), the MOND acceleration scale a0 happens\nto parametrize, in this model, the expansion of the internal force at short distances, i.e.\nd \u2192 0 (in the regime where g \u2192 0).\nEquation (19) represents the value of the force at equilibrium, i.e. when (15) is\nsatisfied, and it depends on the number n of particles. However the internal force F i\nitself - not necessarily at equilibrium - is defined by the equations of motion (9)\u2013\n(10) for a single dipole moment without reference to n, and in this sense is intrinsic\nto the dipole moment. Nevertheless it seems unusual that the equilibrium force (19)\nshould depend on the surrounding density n of the medium. In Sec. 6 we shall show\nthat this force is actually the one corresponding to an harmonic oscillator describing the\noscillations of a \"gravitational plasma\" at its natural plasma frequency. The dependence\non n of Eq. (19) will then appear to be that involved into the usual expression [22] of\nthe plasma frequency, as given by Eq. (29) below.\nIn addition, we want to recover the usual Newtonian gravity when g \u226b a0 , and\nwe see from Eq. (17) that it suffices that d(g)/g \u2192 0 when g \u2192 \u221e. There is a large\nnumber of possibilities; many force laws F (d) do it in practice. For instance we can\nadopt d \u221d g 1\u2212\u01eb with any \u01eb > 0, which corresponds to the power force law F (d) \u221d d\u03b1\nwith \u03b1 = 1/(1 \u2212 \u01eb), and we see that any powers \u03b1, except those with 0 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 1, are\npossible. In the discussion below we shall choose \u01eb > 1 in order to ensure that d \u2192 0 in\nthe Newtonian regime. The particular case \u01eb = 3/2 gives back the 1/d2 type force law.\nIn this case we can adopt for the susceptibility function\n\u0012 \u0013\u0015\n\u0012 \u00133/2 \u0014\n1\na0\n1+O\n.\n(20)\n\u03c7=\u2212\ng\ng\nThis corresponds to the dipolar separation\n\u0012 \u00131/2 \u0014\n\u0012 \u0013\u0015\na0\n1\na0\n1+O\n,\nd=\n4\u03c0 G m n g\ng\n\n(21)\n\nand internal force\n\n\u00112 h\n\u0001i\na0\n1 + O d2 .\n(22)\n4\u03c0 G m n d\nNotice that because the expression (22) is positive, it represents a Coulombian force,\ni.e. attractive between unlike masses.\nSince d tends to zero in both the Newtonian and MOND regimes, we see that the\nfunction d \u2192 F (d) is actually two-valued. We have already noticed that F depends\nnot only on d but also on g; the expression of the force (19) is valid in the MOND\nregime where g \u2192 0, while Eq. (22) holds in the Newtonian regime where g \u2192 \u221e. An\nF = m a0\n\n\u0010\n\n\f10\n\nGravitational polarization\n\nalternative (but rather ad hoc) choice, encompassing both types of behavior, is provided\nby the susceptibility function \u03c7 = \u2212e\u2212g/a0 . In this case we have\ng\ne\u2212g/a0 ,\n(23)\nd=\n4\u03c0 G m n\nand the force law F (d) at equilibrium is obtained by substituting g = F/m in the RHS\nand looking for the two-valued inverse.\nd\nd max\n\ng =F\nm\na0\n2\n\nFigure 1.\ncondition F\nmoments is\nanalogue of\n\nThe dipolar separation distance d as a function of g. The equilibrium\n= m g is satisfied. Such graph is valid when the number density n of dipole\nconstant. More generally, for non constant n, the physically meaningful\nd would be the polarization \u03a0 = n m d (cf. Fig. 4 in paper II).\n\nThe generic form of the distance function d(g) is illustrated in Fig. 1. From the\nfigure we comment on the physical picture one might have in mind. In the absence of\ngravitational fields, i.e. in the absence of ordinary matter, the dipole moments do not\nexist (at least classically) since their separation d is zero. Indeed, when g = 0 we have\nd = 0 by Eq. (18). The dipolar ether does not produce any noticeable effect. Suppose\nthat some external mass, made of ordinary matter, is steadily approached. The dipole\nmoments start feeling a weak gravitational field and they become active. According to\nEq. (18) and Fig. 1, the dipoles open up and get aligned in the gravitational field in\norder to maintain the equilibrium (15). The medium is polarized, we are in the MOND\nregime, and the gravitational field is dominated by the contribution of the polarization\nmasses. Further approaching the ordinary mass, the dipolar separation d eventually\nreaches a maximal value. From (18) we find, approximately,\na0\n,\n(24)\ndmax \u2248\n16\u03c0 G m n\nwhich is reached for g \u2248 a0 /2. If at that point we continue to increase the gravitational\nfield (putting nearer the external mass), d will begin to decrease and the dipole moments\nwill close up. Finally, for strong gravitational fields, the dipole moments become inactive\nagain (indeed d = 0 when g \u2192 \u221e). The gravitational field is dominated by the\ncontribution of the ordinary matter, and we recover the Newtonian regime.\n6. Gravitational plasma\nThe medium of dipolar dark matter described above can also be interpreted, in an\nalternative formulation, as a polarizable \"gravitational plasma\" consisting of the two\n\n\fGravitational polarization\n\n11\n\nspecies of particles (mi , mg ) = (m, \u00b1m). Such formulation will essentially be equivalent\nto the previous one, but is simpler and more appealing physically.\nSuppose that the two types of particles (m, \u00b1m) are in equal numbers so that the\nplasma is globally neutral. There is an equilibrium point where the plasma is locally\nneutral, so the number densities of the two particle species are equal, at each point, to\nsome common constant and uniform value n. As it stands the equilibrium is unstable\nbecause the gravitational force between unlike masses is repulsive. To ensure a stable\nequilibrium we must postulate like in Eqs. (9)\u2013(10) some restoring non-gravitational\nforce F i , acting between the masses mg = \u00b1m, and superseding the gravitational force.\nWe introduce some associated internal field f i such that\nF i = \u2212mf i ,\nand assert that this field obeys a Gauss law in the non-relativistic limit,\n4\u03c0 G m\n(n+ \u2212 n\u2212 ) .\n\u2202i f i = \u2212\n\u03c7\n\n(25)\n\n(26)\n\nThe number densities of the particles species (m, \u00b1m) are denoted by n\u00b1 . We have\nintroduced here the susceptibility coefficient \u03c7 to represent a dimensionless coupling\nconstant characterizing the internal interaction. Notice that since \u03c7 is negative, Eq. (8),\nthe force law (26) is attractive between unlike particles and repulsive between like\nones. Furthermore, supposing that the plasma is bathed by an external gravitational\nfield g i , constant and uniform over some region of consideration,+ we expect that the\ncoupling constant should reflect the presence of this gravitational field, and we assume\na dependence on its norm g, namely \u03c7 = \u03c7(g).\nLet xi+ and xi\u2212 (in short xi\u00b1 ) be the displacement vectors of the masses from the\nequilibrium position characterized by the density n. The particles are accelerated by\nthe internal field f i and by the applied external gravitational field g i . The equations of\nmotion have already been given in Eqs. (9)\u2013(10) and read now\nd2 xi\u00b1\n= \u00b1 m (f i + g i ) .\n(27)\ndt2\nConsider a small departure from equilibrium, corresponding to small displacement\nvectors xi\u00b1 . The density perturbations are given by n\u00b1 = n (1 \u2212 \u2202i xi\u00b1 ) to first order\nin the displacements xi\u00b1 . Using Eq. (26) we readily integrate for f i and inject the\nsolution into (27). In this way we find that xi+ + xi\u2212 = 0 (the centre of inertial masses\nis at rest - neglecting tidal fields), together with the following harmonic oscillator for\n\u03c0 i = m di where di = xi+ \u2212 xi\u2212 ,\nm\n\nd2 \u03c0 i\n+ \u03c9 2 \u03c0 i = 2m g i .\ndt2\n\n+\n\n(28)\n\nWe adopt the frame associated with the plasma's equilibrium configuration. The gravitational field\ng i is defined in that frame.\n\n\fGravitational polarization\n\n12\n\nActually this computation is the classic derivation of the plasma frequency [22] which\nis found for the case at hands to be\ns\n8\u03c0 G m n\n.\n(29)\n\u03c9= \u2212\n\u03c7\nThe frequency depends on the density n of the plasma at equilibrium and on the strength\nof the internal interaction which is encoded into the coupling constant \u03c7. The solution\nwe get for the internal field is\n\u03c92 i\n\u03c92 i\n\u03c0\n=\u21d2 F i =\n\u03c0 ,\n(30)\n2m\n2\nso we can check that Eq. (28) is equivalent to our previous equation (13) (recall that\nhere g i is considered to be constant and uniform). The particles oscillate around some\nnon-zero mean position that is determined by the ambiant gravitational field as\n2m\n(31)\nh\u03c0 i i = 2 g i .\n\u03c9\nThe mean value of the force is\nfi = \u2212\n\nhF i i = m g i ,\n\n(32)\n\nand coincides with the equilibrium condition postulated in Eq. (15).\nThis result (31) is classical but can easily be recovered from standard quantization\nof the harmonic oscillator (28). The spectrum of \"plasmons\" is discrete (k \u2208 N) with\nenergy levels shifted by the gravitational field [27],\n\u0013\n\u0012\nm g2\n3\n~\u03c9 \u2212\n.\n(33)\nEk = k +\n2\n2\u03c9 2\n\nThe eigenstates are |\u03c8p1 p2 p3 i = |\u03c6p1 i|\u03c6p2 i|\u03c6p3 i where k = p1 +p2 +p3 ; the eigenvalues have\ndegeneracy (k + 1)(k + 2)/2. The one-dimensional eigenstate function \u03c6pi (\u03c0 i ) = h\u03c0 i |\u03c6pi i\ng i ) where (Hp being the Hermite polynomial)\nis of the form \u03c6pi (\u03c0 i \u2212 2m\n\u03c92\np\n\u03c9\n1 \u0010 \u03c9 \u00111/4\n2\nHp ( ~\u03c9m \u03c1) e\u2212 2~ m \u03c1 .\n(34)\n\u03c6p (\u03c1) = p \u221a\n2 2 p! \u03c0 ~ m\n\nThe expectation value h\u03c0 i i = h\u03c8p1 p2 p3 |\u03c0 i |\u03c8p1 p2 p3 i does not vanish due to the presence of\nR +\u221e\nthe gravitational field; it can be computed using \u2212\u221e d\u03c0 \u03c0 |\u03c6p (\u03c0 \u2212 2m\ng)|2 = 2m\ng and\n\u03c92\n\u03c92\nthe result agrees with (31).\nWe analyze the effect of the mean dipole moment vector (31) on the equation for\nthe gravitational field g i (supposed now to be generated by external sources). More\nprecisely we argue that the mean value is really a quantum expectation value as we\nhave just proved, so that by adopting a \"semi-classical\" approach this expectation value\nh\u03c0 i i should have a direct effect as the source for the classical gravitational field g i . The\npolarization readily follows from the expression of the plasma frequency (29) as\n\u03c7 i\ng .\n(35)\n\u03a0i = n h\u03c0 i i = \u2212\n4\u03c0 G\nso that we recover exactly Eq. (3). Note that the constant density n of the plasma at\nequilibrium is equal to the density of dipole moments. The polarization is automatically\n\n\fGravitational polarization\n\n13\n\nproportional to the gravitational field. This is an attractive feature of the present\nformulation based on a gravitational plasma; there is no need to invoke a mechanism to\nalign \u03a0i with g i . Following the same reasoning as in Sec. 2, the polarization (35) gives\nrize to the density of polarization masses (4), which is added to the RHS of the Poisson\nlaw, Eq. (5). The MOND equation (1) readily follows.\nLet us comment on the field equation (26) for the supposedly fundamental internal\ninteraction f i . In the absence of gravity we have \u03c7 = \u22121, hence Eq. (26) becomes\nthat of a negative Poisson equation corresponding to a negative Newtonian force (with\n\"anti-gravitational\" constant \u2212G). On the other hand, in strong gravity (g/a0 \u2192 \u221e)\nwe have \u03c7 \u2192 0 and we see that the strength of the internal field f i becomes infinite.\nTherefore the plasma gets locked in its undisturbed equilibrium state for which \u03c0 i = 0\n(strictly speaking this is true if g\u03c7 \u2192 0 when g \u2192 \u221e). In this limit the dipolar medium\nis inactive; there is no induced polarization and the Newtonian law holds.\nNote that there is clearly some amount of fine tuning in the present model (and\nthe one of paper II). Namely the function \u03c7(g) is not determined from first principles\nwithin the model but is tuned to agree with the phenomenology of MOND. In particular\n\u03c7(0) = \u22121 is not \"explained\" in the model but comes from astronomical observations.\nSimilarly \u03c7(\u221e) = 0 is imposed in order to recover the Newtonian regime where it is\nobserved to be valid.\nTo conclude, the phenomenology of MOND suggests the existence of a polarization\nmechanism at work at the scale of galactic structures, and which could be viewed as\nthe gravitational analogue of the electric polarization of a dielectric material. The\ndark matter would consist of the polarization masses associated with some gravitational\ndipole moments aligned with the gravitational field of ordinary masses. We find that\nthe properties of the dipolar dark matter are governed by the internal non-gravitational\nforce linking together the constituents of the dipolar medium. The formulation of this\nmedium in terms of an oscillating gravitational plasma polarized in the gravitational\nfield is particular attractive. In paper II we shall show how the notion of dipolar particle\ncan be made compatible with the framework of general relativity.\nAcknowledgments\nIt is a pleasure to thank C\u00e9dric Deffayet, Gilles Esposito-Far\u00e8se, Moti Milgrom and\nJean-Philippe Uzan for interesting discussions.\nReferences\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n\nBertone, G., Hooper, D., & Silk, J., 2005, Phys.
