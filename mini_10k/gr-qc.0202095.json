Planets, stars and galaxies carry fields that\nare large and extensive. The Milky Way has a magnetic field, coherent along the plane of\nthe galaxy, with strength of a few \u03bcG. Magnetic fields also permeate the intracluster region\nof galaxy clusters, extending well beyond the core region of the cluster. In addition, reports of\nFaraday rotation in high redshift Lyman-\u03b1 systems suggest that dynamically significant magnetic\nfields might have been present at high redshift condensations. In short, the more we look for\nmagnetic fields in the universe the more ubiquitous we find them to be [1]-[3]. Gravitational\nwaves, on the other hand, are as elusive as ever. An inevitable prediction of general relativity,\ngravitational waves are propagating ripples in the spacetime fabric triggered by changes in the\nmatter distribution. Their extremely weak coupling to matter, however, means that detecting\nthese ripples is a formidable task. Given the ubiquity of magnetic fields in the universe and\ntheir strong presence near some of the most promising candidates for detectable gravity wave\nsignals, understanding the interaction between the two sources becomes especially interesting.\nCosmology could provide the grounds for an exploratory first step, and recently there were two\nattempts in this direction [4, 5]. The former employed the covariant formalism to investigate the\nevolution of gravitational waves in a magnetised cosmological environment. The latter adopted\na metric based approach to study gravity wave production by stochastic large-scale magnetic\nfields.1 Here, following on the work of [4], we attempt to revisit the issue. Our geometrical\napproach brings to the fore the vector nature and the tension properties of magnetic fields and\nreveals the intricate interconnection between magnetic tension and spatial geometry. A direct\n\u2217\n\ne-mail address: ctsagas@maths.uct.ac.za\nThe issue of magnetically induced tensor (i.e. gravitational wave) signatures in the Cosmic Microwave Background spectrum has been raised and discussed in [6, 7] and also in [4].\n1\n\n1\n\n\fimplication of this coupling is that the magnetic contribution to spatial curvature deformations,\nalong the field's own direction, is always zero.\nWe begin with a brief outline of the covariant formalism and then apply it to the treatment\nof gravitational wave perturbations in a weakly magnetized, almost-FRW, cosmological environment. Our background universe is a non-magnetized, spatially flat FRW cosmology filled with\na single perfect fluid of very high conductivity. This model is perturbed by allowing for weak\ngravitational waves and a weak magnetic field and the impact of the field on the evolution of\nthe waves is analysed. We introduce no a priori relation between the wave and the magnetic\nanisotropies, which enables us to look beyond the gravity-wave production issue. Throughout the\nanalysis we employ covariantly defined tensors and use scalars that are invariantly constructed\nfrom these tensors. This means that we can account for the full spectrum of the directionally\ndependent magnetic effects, particularly those coming from the tension properties of the field\nlines. Confining to large scales we calculate the magnetic effects analytically both in the radiation and the dust dominated eras. We find that the presence of the field leaves the linear\nevolution of the waves unaffected, but modifies their magnitude. This implies that the overall\nmagnetic impact depends entirely on the initial conditions. In the absence of gravity waves, we\nfind that the anisotropic nature of the field leads to wave production. In general, however, the\nmagnetic effect is particularly sensitive to the initial curvature deformation as measured along\nthe direction of the field lines. This is where the subtle role of the magnetic tension becomes\nimportant. A negative curvature perturbation is found to boost the energy of the waves, whereas\npositive curvature leads to a damping effect. In either case the tension properties of the field\ntend to keep the spatial curvature deformation down to a minimum.\nThe layout of the paper is as follows. In Secs. 2 and 3 we provide a brief description of the\ncovariant treatment of cosmological perturbations and of cosmic magnetic fields respectively.\nSection 4 presents the necessary formalism for the study of gravitational waves within weakly\nmagnetized almost-FRW cosmologies. The equations for the linear evolution of the wave's energy\ndensity are given in Sec. 5, and in Sec. 6 we look into the magnetic effects on gravitational\nradiation during the radiation and the dust dominated eras.\nWe employ a metric with signature (\u2212 + ++), the spacetime indices take the values 0, 1, 2, 3\nand use geometrised units with c = 1 = 8\u03c0G. The Riemann and Ricci tensors are fixed by\n2\u2207[a \u2207b] uc = Rabcd ud and Rab = Rc acb respectively.\n\n2\n\nCovariant description of cosmological perturbations\n\nThe Ellis-Bruni approach to cosmological perturbations [8], follows earlier studies by Hawking [9]\nand Olson [10], and is based on Ehlers' work on covariant hydrodynamics [11]. For a detailed\nand updated presentation of the covariant formalism the reader is referred to [12]. The essence of\nthe method is to identify a set of covariantly defined variables that describe the inhomogeneity\nand the anisotropy of the universe in a transparent and gauge invariant manner. The nonlinear equations governing the dynamics of these variables are then obtained from the full field\nequations. The transparency of the covariant variables means that the physical and geometrical\ncontent of their dynamical equations is simple to extract. The non-linear formulae can be\nlinearised about a chosen background yielding a set of equations that describe deviations from\ninhomogeneity and isotropy in a straightforward way.\nIn the covariant approach all physical and geometrical quantities are decomposed with respect\nto a fundamental timelike velocity field ua . The latter is determined by the motion of the matter\n\n2\n\n\fin the universe and introduces a unique time plus space (1+3) threading of the spacetime, as\nopposed to the 3+1 ADM slicing. Every observer has an instantaneous three-dimensional rest\nspace, which is the tangent hypersurface orthogonal to ua . In a general cosmological model ua\nis chosen so that it reduces to the preferred velocity at the FRW limit, thus guaranteeing the\ngauge invariance of the formalism. The metric hab = gab + ua ub of the observer's rest space\n(gab is the spacetime metric) also defines the projected covariant derivative Da according to\nDa Tb... c... = ha d hb e . . . hc f . . . \u2207d Te... f ... . When ua is irrotational, Da reduces to the covariant\nderivative in the hypersurfaces orthogonal to the observer's world line. It is also convenient to\nintroduce the derivative \u1e6ab... c... = ua \u2207a Tb... c... along the flow lines of ua . With these definitions,\nthe covariant derivative of the fundamental velocity field decopmoses as\n\u2207b ua = \u03c3ab + \u03c9ab + 13 \u0398hab \u2212 u\u0307a ub .\n\n(1)\n\nThe above defines the shear \u03c3ab = Dhb uai , the vorticity \u03c9ab = D[b ua] , the (volume) expansion\nscalar \u0398 = Da ua and the 4-acceleration u\u0307a = ub \u2207b ua associated with the observer's motion.2 Introducing the projected totally antisymmetric tensor \u03b5abc = \u03b7abcd ud , where \u03b7abcd is the spacetime\nalternating tensor, we define the vorticity vector \u03c9a = \u03b5abc \u03c9 bc /2. The latter is also written as\n\u03c9a = \u2212curlua /2 with curlua = \u03b5abc Db uc . In addition we introduce the generalised curl of tensors\nby curlTab...c = \u03b5de(a Dd Tb...c) e . The volume expansion defines an average length scale a, namely\nthe scale factor of the universe, via \u0227/a = \u0398/3. The variables \u03c3ab , \u03c9a , and u\u0307a characterise\nanisotropy in the local expansion and vanish identically in the FRW limit. The projected gradients of scalars, vector and tensors describe local inhomogeneity in the observer's instantaneous\nrest space and also vanish in exact FRW spacetimes.\nAn additional key decomposition is that of the matter stress-energy tensor Tab . Relative to\na fundamental observer,\nTab = \u03bcua ub + phab + 2q(a ub) + \u03c0ab ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03bc = Tab ua ub is the energy density, p = hab T ab /3 is the isotropic pressure, qa = ha b Tbc uc\nis the energy flux and \u03c0ab = Thabi are the anisotropic stresses of the matter component. In\nthe FRW limit qa and \u03c0ab vanish, as the energy-momentum tensor is always of the perfect-fluid\nform.\n\n3\n3.1\n\nThe magnetic field\nCovariant description of cosmic magnetic fields\n\nThe covariant description of electromagnetic fields was given in [14], and the Ellis-Bruni approach was applied to magnetized cosmological perturbations in [15, 16]. Covariantly, the electromagnetic Faraday tensor (Fab ) decomposes into an electric (Ea ) and a magnetic (Ha ) field\nas\nFab = u[a Eb] + \u03b5abc H c ,\n\n(3)\n\n2\nRound brackets indicate symmetrization and square ones antisymmetrisation. Angled brackets indicate the\nprojected, symmetric, trace-free part (PSTF) of second rank tensors (i.e. Shabi = [h(a c hb) d \u2212 (1/3)hcd hab ]Sab ) and\nthe projected part of vectors (i.e. Vhai = ha b Vb ) [13].\n\n3\n\n\fimplying that Ea = Fab ua and Ha = \u03b5abc F bc /2. Assuming that the universe is described by\nan infinitely conductive medium during most of its lifetime, we can ignore the presence of the\nelectric field. Then Maxwell's equations reduce to one propagation equation\n\u1e22hai = \u2212 32 \u0398Ha + \u03c3ab H b + \u03b5abc H b \u03c9 c ,\n\n(4)\n\n\u03b5abc u\u0307b H c + curlHa = Jhai ,\n\n(5)\n\nand three constraints\n\n2\u03c9a H\n\na\n\n= \u03c1e ,\n\n(6)\n\nDa H\n\na\n\n= 0,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere Jhai = ha b Jb is the projected current density and \u03c1e = \u2212ua J a is the charge density [15].\nThe above determine the evolution of the magnetic field completely. Relative to the fundamental\nobserver, the stress-energy tensor of the field decomposes as\nTab = 21 H 2 ua ub + 61 H 2 hab + \u03a0ab ,\n\n(8)\n\n\u03a0ab = \u2212Hha Hbi = 13 H 2 hab \u2212 Ha Hb .\n\n(9)\n\nwhere H 2 = Ha H a and\n\nNote that in the absence of electric fields the electromagnetic Poynting vector vanishes. Thus,\nthe magnetic field behaves as a special imperfect fluid with energy density \u03bcm = H 2 /2, isotropic\npressure pm = H 2 /6 and anisotropic pressure \u03a0ab . The latter reflects the vector nature of the\nfield and carries the tension properties of the magnetic force lines.\n\n3.2\n\nThe magnetic tension\n\nMagnetic fields exert an isotropic pressure in all directions and carry a tension along their lines\nof force, with each flux tube behaving like an infinitely elastic rubber band [17, 18]. The tension\nproperties are encoded in the eigenvalues of \u03a0ab . Orthogonal to Ha there are two positive\neigenvalues equal to 1/3 each. Thus, the magnetic pressure perpendicular to the field lines is\npositive, reflecting their tendency to push each other apart. In the Ha direction, however, the\neigenvalue is -2/3 and the magnetic pressure is negative. The minus sign reflects the elasticity\nof the magnetic lines and their tendency to remain as \"straight\" as possible. It should be\nemphasized that the total magnetic pressure along the direction of the field lines is also negative\nand equals pmg = \u2212\u03bcmg = \u2212H 2 /2. In other words, the false vacuum condition is satisfied along\nthe magnetic lines of force.\nThe magnetic tension has also non-trivial implications for the geometry of a magnetised\n3-dimensional space. Consider, for example, the non-linear Gauss-Codacci equation associated\nwith a non-rotating magnetized spacetime. The Ricci curvature tensor of the spatial hypersurfaces decomposes irreducibly to [15]\nRab = 31 Rhab + 12 \u03a0ab \u2212 13 \u0398\u03c3ab + \u03c3cha \u03c3 c bi + Eab ,\n\n(10)\n\n\u0001\nR = 2 \u03bc + 12 H 2 \u2212 23 \u03982 + 2\u03c3 2 ,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere\n\n4\n\n\fis the associated Ricci scalar and we have assumed a infinitely conductive perfect fluid for\nsimplicity. Ignoring all sources but the magnetic field and then contracting twice along the field\nlines we obtain\nR \u2261 Rab \u03b7 a \u03b7 b = 13 H 2 + 21 \u03a0ab \u03b7 a \u03b7 b = 0 ,\n\n(12)\n\n\u221a\non using expression (9) for \u03a0ab . Note that \u03b7a = Ha / H 2 is the unit vector parallel to the\nmagnetic force lines (i.e. \u03b7a ua = 0 and \u03b7a \u03b7 a = 1). Hence, the tension properties of the field\nensure that the spatial curvature along the magnetic direction is unaffected by the energy input\nof the field. This result demonstrates the generic tendency of the field lines to remain straight\nand it is indicative of what one might call a natural magnetic preference flat spatial geometry. It\nis also independent of the energy density of the field, namely of how close together or far apart\nthe magnetic lines are. Thus, no matter how much energy one pumps into or removes from the\nfield the magnetic contribution to Rab \u03b7 a \u03b7 b remains zero.\nIt should be emphasised that, despite their directional dependence, the tension properties of\nthe field can affect average scalars such as the volume expansion of the universe (see [19]-[21]).\nAs it turns out, they can also affect the energy density of gravitational waves passing through a\nmagnetised region.\n\n4\n4.1\n\nCovariant description of magnetized gravitational waves\nThe background equations\n\nConsider an unperturbed non-magnetized FRW universe filled with a single barotropic fluid of\ninfinite conductivity. When the spatial sections are flat, the background model is described by\ntwo propagation equations\n\u03bc\u0307 = \u2212(1 + w)\u0398\u03bc ,\n\n\u0398\u0307 =\n\n\u2212 31 \u03982\n\n+\n\n1\n2 \u03bc(1\n\n(13)\n+ 3w) ,\n\n(14)\n\nand one constraint\n\u03bc = 13 \u03982 ,\n\n(15)\n\nwhere w = p/\u03bc. Assuming that the fluid retains the barotropic equation of state (i.e. p =\np(\u03bc) always) and remains highly conductive, we perturb the background allowing for weak\ngravitational waves and a weak magnetic field. The infinite conductivity of the medium means\nthat we can disregard any large-scale electric fields. The weakness of the magnetic field allows us\nto treat its energy density, its isotropic pressure and also the anisotropic magnetic stresses as first\norder perturbations. This automatically ensures that all three of them are gauge-independent\nvariables. Finally, we assume that the magnetic field is coherent on all scales of interest.\n\n4.2\n\nThe linear equations\n\nThe covariant description of gravitational waves, in the absence of magnetic fields, was originally\nconsidered by Hawking [9], while more recent treatments can be found in [22, 23].3 Covariantly,\n3\nAlthough the magnetic field can be treated as a viscous fluid, the approach discussed in [9] is not applicable\nhere, since we are not introducing any phenomenological relation between the shear and the anisotropic stresses.\n\n5\n\n\fwe monitor gravity waves via the electric (Eab = Ehabi ) and magnetic (Hab = Hhabi ) components\nof the Weyl (or conformal curvature) tensor Cabcd . The latter describes the locally free gravitational field, namely tidal forces and gravity waves. For a fundamental observer the Weyl tensor\ndecomposes as [24]\nCabcd = (gabqp gcdsr \u2212 \u03b7abqp \u03b7cdsr ) uq us E pr \u2212 (\u03b7abqp gcdsr + gabqp \u03b7cdsr ) uq us H pr ,\n\n(16)\n\nwhere gabcd = gac gbd \u2212 gad gbc is the de Witt supermetric and \u03b7abcd is the 4-dimensional permutation tensor. It follows that\nEab = Cacbd uc ud ,\nHab =\n\ncd e\n1\n2 \u03b5acd Cbe u ,\n\n(17)\n(18)\n\nwhere \u03b5abc = \u03b7abcd ud is the alternating tensor on the observer's 3-dimensional rest space. The\nelectric part of the Weyl tensor plays the role of the tidal tensor associated with the Newtonian\ngravitational potential, while Hab is essential for the propagation of gravitational radiation.\nGiven that the Weyl tensor vanishes in FRW spacetimes, Eab and Hab provide a covariant and\ngauge invariant description of perturbations in the gravitational field. The electric and magnetic\ncomponents of Cabcd also support the different polarisation states of propagating gravitational\nradiation and obey evolution equations remarkably similar to Maxwell's formulae [25]. In the\npresence of a weak magnetic field, the linear evolution of Eab and Hab is determined by the\nsystem\n\u0116ab = \u2212\u0398Eab + 21 \u0398\u03a0ab \u2212 21 \u03bc(1 + w)\u03c3ab + curlHab\n\n\u1e22ab = \u2212\u0398Hab \u2212 curlEab +\n\u03c3\u0307ab =\n\n\u03a0\u0307ab =\n\n\u2212 32 \u0398\u03c3ab \u2212\n\u2212 43 \u0398\u03a0ab ,\n\nEab +\n\n1\n2 curl\u03a0ab ,\n\n1\n2 \u03a0ab\n\n+ Dha u\u0307bi ,\n\n(19)\n(20)\n(21)\n(22)\n\nsupplemented by the constrains\nDb Eab =\n\n+ 41 Da H 2 \u2212 12 \u03b5abc H b curlH c ,\n\n1\n3 Da \u03bc\n\nb\n\nD Hab = \u03bc(1 + w)\u03c9a ,\nb\n\nb\n\nc\n\nD \u03a0ab = \u03b5abc H curlH \u2212\nb\n\nD \u03c3ab =\n\n2\n3 Da \u0398\n\n2\n1\n6 Da H ,\n\n+ curl\u03c9a .\n\n(23)\n(24)\n(25)\n(26)\n\nFinally, one should keep in mind that to linear order\nHab = curl\u03c3ab + Dha u\u0307bi .\n\n4.3\n\n(27)\n\nIsolating the tensor perturbations\n\nIn the absence of the magnetic field one isolates the pure tensor perturbations of Eab and Hab ,\nnamely the gravitational waves, by demanding that\n\u03c9a = 0 = Da \u03bc ,\n\n(28)\n\nat all times. The above constraints set all the linear scalar and vector perturbations to zero, while\nensuring that the remaining tensor fields are all transverse (i.e. Da Eab = Da Hab = Db \u03c3ab = 0).\nIn the magnetic presence, however, one needs to impose two additional constrains\nDa H 2 = 0 = \u03b5abc H b curlH c .\n6\n\n(29)\n\n\fIn other words, the spatial gradients of the magnetic energy density vanish and the field is also\nforce free. Restrictions (29) ensure that constraints (28) also hold in the presence of the magnetic\nfield (see Eqs. (37), (41) in [26]). Together, conditions (28), (29) imply that Da p = 0, u\u0307a = 0\nand Da \u0398 = 0. In particular, the 3-gradients of the pressure vanish as a result of the barotropic\nequation of state. The vanishing of the 4-acceleration comes from the linearised momentumdensity conservation law (see Eq. (87) in [15]). Finally, the linear propagation equation of\ngradients in the matter density guarantees that Da \u0398 = 0 to first order (see Eqs. (90), (91)\nin [15]). The same sets of constrains also guarantee the transversality of all the associated\ntensor fields, as Eqs. (23)-(26) immediately verify.\n\n5\n5.1\n\nLinear magnetized gravitational waves\nEvolution of the wave anisotropy\n\nHaving isolated the tensor modes, we drop the acceleration terms from Eqs. (21) and (27).\nMoreover, the spatial flatness of the background means that the first order relation Hab = curl\u03c3ab\ntranslates into curlHab = \u2212D2 \u03c3ab , where D2 = Da Da is the projected Laplacian operator. It\nfollows that we can eliminate the magnetic Weyl tensor from Eq. (19) in favour of the shear and\ntherefore reduce the total number of the equations by one. Thus, the linear evolution of the\nmagnetized gravity waves is monitored by\n\u03c3\u0307ab = \u2212 23 \u0398\u03c3ab \u2212 Eab + 12 \u03a0ab ,\n\n(30)\n\n\u0116ab = \u2212\u0398Eab + 12 \u0398\u03a0ab \u2212 21 \u03bc(1 + w)\u03c3ab \u2212 D2 \u03c3ab ,\n\n\u03a0\u0307ab =\n\n\u2212 43 \u0398\u03a0ab .\n\n(31)\n(32)\n\nAccording to Eqs. (30) and (31), the field acts as a source of gravitational wave perturbations.\nIndeed, even when \u03c3ab = 0 = Eab initially, \u03c3\u0307ab , \u0116ab 6= 0 because of the magnetic presence. This\nis not surprising at all, given that magnetic fields are natural sources of anisotropic stresses. As\nwe shall see later, however, the specific form of these stresses (i.e. the tension properties of the\nmagnetic field lines) means that the field presence can also suppress gravity wave distortions.\nConfining to large scales we can ignore the Laplacian term in the right-hand side of Eq. (31)\nand reduce the above given system to\n\u03c3\u0307ab = \u2212 32 \u0398\u03c3ab \u2212 Eab + 12 \u03a0ab ,\n\n\u0116ab = \u2212\u0398Eab +\n\n1\n2 \u0398\u03a0ab\n\n\u03a0\u0307ab = \u2212 34 \u0398\u03a0ab .\n\n5.2\n\n\u2212\n\n1\n2 \u03bc(1 +\n\n(33)\nw)\u03c3ab ,\n\n(34)\n(35)\n\nEvolution of the wave energy\n\nConsider the magnitudes \u03c3 2 = \u03c3ab \u03c3 ab /2 and E 2 = Eab E ab /2 of the shear and the electric\nWeyl tensors respectively. Once the pure tensor perturbations have been isolated, these are the\nonly scalars one can invariantly construct from \u03c3ab and Eab . Moreover, \u03c3 2 and E 2 provide a\ndirect measure of the wave's energy density and amplitude4 Their large-scale evolution comes\n4\nThe energy density of gravitational radiation is determined by the pure tensor (i.e. the traceless and transverse\nTT\n- TT) part H\u03b1\u03b2\nof the metric perturbation (e.g. see [5])\n\n\u03c1GW =\n\n1\n2\n\n\u03b1\u03b2 \u2032\nTT \u2032\n(H\u03b1\u03b2\n) (HTT\n)\n,\n2\na\n\n7\n\n(36)\n\n\fby contracting Eqs.

(30), (31) (or equivalently (33), (34)) the magnetic effects on \u03c3ab and\nEab propagate via \u03a0ab = \u2212Hha Hbi . Since both \u03c3ab and Eab are also trace-free tensors, the\nmagnetic effects on \u03c3 2 and E 2 propagate through the last two terms in Eqs. (38), (39), namely\nvia the contractions \u03a3 = \u03c3ab \u03b7 a \u03b7 b and E = Eab \u03b7 a \u03b7 b . The latter describe the \"squeezing\" and\nthe \"stretching\" of the space, along \u03b7a , that is caused by the propagating gravitational wave.\nCrucially, \u03b7a is the direction the magnetic tension acts along. Hence, after the scalar and the\nvector modes have been switched off, the only remaining linear magnetic effect comes from the\ntension properties of the field lines.\nThe scalars \u03a3 and E are related to spatial curvature perturbations via the Gauss-Codacci\nequation. Contracting Eq. (10) twice along \u03b7a and keeping up to first order terms we arrive at\nR = E \u2212 31 \u0398\u03a3 ,\n\n(44)\n\nwhere R is the total spatial curvature perturbation along the magnetic direction.5 Recall that\nthe total contribution of the field to R is zero (see Sec. 3.2), which explains the absence of any\nmagnetic terms in the above. Also, given that all scalar perturbations have been switched off\nand that the background geometry is flat, Eq. (44) contains no matter or expansion terms either.\nwhere a is the dimensionless scale factor, \u03b1 , \u03b2 = 1, 2, 3 and the dash indicates conformal time derivatives. In\na comoving frame the shear of the fluid flow is a 3-tensor (i.e. \u03c300 = 0 = \u03c30\u03b1 ). Also, the pure tensor part\nof the covariantly defined shear is related to the traceless ransverse component of the metric perturbation by\n\u03b1\u03b2\n\u03b1\u03b2 \u2032\nTT\nTT \u2032\n\u03c3\u03b1\u03b2\n= a(H\u03b1\u03b2\n) , with \u03c3TT\n= a\u22123 (HTT\n) (see [27, 28]). On using these relations Eq. (36) gives\n2\n\u03c1GW = \u03c3TT\n,\n\n(37)\n\n2\nTT \u03b1\u03b2\nwith \u03c3TT\n= \u03c3\u03b1\u03b2\n\u03c3TT /2.\n5\nIn [4] the scalars \u03a3 and E were related to spatial curvature distortions by twice contracting the PSTF part of\nEq. (10) along \u03b7a . Here we exploit the fact that the magnetic contribution to 3-curvature perturbations (along\nthe direction of the field lines) vanishes, and relate \u03a3 and E to the total spatial curvature perturbation R. This\nchoice does not alter the essence of the calculation, but allows for a more transparent discussion on the subtle\nrole of spatial curvature perturbations.\n\n8\n\n\f6\n6.1\n\nMagnetic effects on gravitational waves\nThe radiation epoch\n\nWhen radiation dominates w = 1/3, \u03bc = 3/4t2 and \u0398 = 3/2t (see Eqs.

Therefore, the overall magnetic impact depends entirely on the\ninitial conditions and it is sensitive to the initial value of R.

As with radiation before, the overall magnetic effect depends entirely on the initial conditions. Note\nthe magneto-curvature terms in Eqs. (54), (55) and (65), (66). Qualitatively, this magnetogeometrical effect tends to reduce the energy of the wave when the initial curvature distortion\nis positive (i.e. for R0 > 0), but increases both \u03c3 2 and E 2 if R0 < 0. Quantitatively, the effect\ngets stronger with increasing curvature distortion. We will return to this non-trivial behavior of\nthe field later.\n10\n\n\f6.3\n\nProduction of gravitational waves\n\nConsider the dust dominated era and assume that there are no gravitational waves originally\npresent. In this case the initial conditions are \u03c302 = E02 = X0 = E0 = \u03a30 = 0. Then solutions\n(62) and (63) give\n\u0012 \u00132/3\n4 2 t0\n2\n3\n,\n(67)\n\u03c3 = 102 H0 t0\nt\n\u0012 \u00138/3\n2\n4 t0\n3\nE = 102 H0\n,\n(68)\nt\n\nwith an analogous result for dust. Thus, the magnetic presence has led to gravity wave perturbations. Note that this magnetically induced production of gravitational waves results purely\nfrom the anisotropic nature of the field. Qualitatively, the tension properties of the magnetic\nfield lines are of no consequence. That is to say any other anisotropic source would have also\ntriggered gravitational wave distortions. Indeed, results (67), (68) remain unchanged when the\nminus sign of the magnetic terms in Eqs. (38)-(42) is replaced by a plus, namely when we switch\nfrom tension to ordinary positive pressure. Assuming the presence of a cosmological magnetic\nfield at recombination we may use result (67) to estimate the strength of the induced gravitational wave. Adopting an upper limit of 10\u22129 G, in today's values (see [29]), we find an\ninduced wave of the order of 10\u221270 GeV 4 also in today's values. The latter lies twelve orders of\nmagnitude bellow the energy density of the inducing magnetic field.\n\n6.4\n\nBoosting and damping of gravitational waves\n\nLet us now return to the magneto-curvature terms in Eqs. (54), (55) and (65), (66). Their\npresence allows for the possibility of a zero overall magnetic effect if R = H 2 /6 initially, namely\nif the curvature distortion along the field lines \"equals\" the isotropic magnetic pressure. Alone,\nthe magneto-curvature terms reduce the energy of the wave if R0 > 0, but lead to an increase\nwhen R0 < 0. The effect results directly from the tension properties of the magnetic force lines.\nIn fact, if tension were replaced by ordinary pressure in Eqs. (38)-(42) the effect is reversed.\nThis intricate behaviour can be seen as the field's reaction to spatial curvature deformations.\nMore specifically, the non-linear Gauss-Codacci equation (10) gives\nR = Rab \u03b7 a \u03b7 b = 23 \u03c3 2 \u2212 13 \u0398\u03c3ab \u03b7 a \u03b7 b + \u03c3cha \u03c3 c bi \u03b7 a \u03b7 b + Eab \u03b7 a \u03b7 b ,\n\n(69)\n\nfor the total perturbation in the spatial curvature along the direction of the field lines. Note\nthe absence of any magnetic terms in the above since the contribution of the field to Rab \u03b7 a \u03b7 b is\nzero (see Sec. 3.2). Also, given that both matter and volume expansion perturbations have been\nswitched off (see Sec. 3.3), 2\u03bc \u2212 \u03982 /3 = 0 due to the background flatness. The last three terms\nin the right-hand side of Eq. (69) describe the \"stretching\" and the \"squeezing\" of the space\n(in the direction of the field lines) caused by the passing gravitational wave and take positive\nor negative values. However on average, say over one oscillation period, their contribution to\nRab \u03b7 a \u03b7 b amounts to zero, leaving \u03c3 2 as the only wave input to curvature deformations. Thus, by\nincreasing \u03c3 2 when the initial curvature is negative and by decreasing it when R0 > 0, the field\ntends to minimise the curvature perturbation along its own direction. This magnetic reaction\nto curvature distortions is indicative of the tension properties of the field lines, that is of their\ntendency to remain as straight as possible. Analogous magneto-curvature effects have also been\nidentified on the expansion of magnetised cosmologies (see [19]) and might be interpreted as an\nindication of a magnetic preference for spatial flatness [20, 21].\n11\n\n\f7\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe question of how magnetic fields interact with gravitational radiation is as timely as ever in\nview of the forthcoming gravity wave detection experiments and the ubiquity of magnetic fields\nin the universe. The lack of extensive research on the subject and the unique features of magnetic\nfields make the outcome of any such study difficult to foresee, while it could also probe unknown\nas yet aspects of fundamental physics. In the present article we have considered the impact of a\nlarge-scale magnetic field on gravity waves in the cosmological context. Our starting point was a\nspatially flat FRW background which was subsequently perturbed by weak gravitational waves\nand a weak magnetic field. We adopted a geometrical approach and employed the covariant\nformalism to examine the field effects on \u03c3 2 and E 2 , the scalars that directly describe the\nenergy density of gravitational radiation. Throughout the analysis we maintained the pure\ntensor nature of the perturbed variables, employed scalars that were invariantly constructed\nfrom these tensors, and did not assume any a priori relation between the magnetic and the\ngravitational wave anisotropies. The geometrical nature of our approach brought to the fore the\ntension properties of magnetic fields and revealed their subtle interconnection with the spatial\ngeometry of the magnetised spacetime. We found that the overall impact of the field depends on\nthe initial set up and is particularly sensitive to the initial curvature deformation as measured\nalong the direction of the field. In the absence of gravitational waves the magnetic presence led\nto wave production. Given the generically anisotropic nature of magnetic fields this is not a\nsurprising result. The non-trivial effects came from the intricate coupling between the geometry\nand the tension properties of the field. The presence of the field was found to suppress the\nenergy of gravitational waves when the initial curvature perturbation was positive, but led to\na boost in the case of positive curvature deformation. Overall, the field seemed to react to the\ncurvature distortion caused by the propagating wave and tried to keep it down to a minimum\nby modulating the wave's energy accordingly.\nThe complete dependence of the magnetic effects on the initial conditions is rather unfortunate, as at this stage it is not clear what are the best physically motivated initial configurations.\nThe ambiguity stems from the fact that, to linear order, R0 depends on \u03a30 and E0 (see Eqs. (53),\n(64)) which can take either positive or negative values. Ii is likely that a non-linear analysis\nwould incorporate \u03c302 , namely the wave's original energy, thus favouring one initial configuration\nat the expense of the other. That aside, some interesting questions emerge when one is allowed\nto speculate on the basis of the linear results. Astrophysical magnetic fields, for example, are\nquite widespread and also considerably strong. Typical spiral galaxies carry extensive fields of\nfew \u03bcG and compact stars can locally support magnetic fields as strong as 1016 G. If the field\npresence were to boost gravity wave perturbations in general, then, depending on the efficiency\nof the mechanism of course, one might think that detecting gravitational waves should have\nbeen a rather straightforward task. If, on the other hand, magnetic fields can suppress gravity\nwaves, the ubiquity of cosmic magnetism could prove a considerable setback for the forthcoming\ngravity wave detection projects.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe author wishes to thank Peter Dunsby, George Ellis and Roy Maartens for helpful discussions\nand comments.
