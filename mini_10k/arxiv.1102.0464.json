Techniques: spectroscopic; Planets: atmospheres; Planets: individual: HD209458b\n\n1. Introduction\nThe first proof of the existence of an exoplanetary atmosphere\nwas given by Charbonneau et al. (2002), once they succeeded\nin the detection of sodium absorption in the transmission spectrum of the exoplanet HD209458b. This result was obtained using the S pace T elescope Imaging S pectrograph (S T IS ) on\nboard of the Hubble S pace T elescope (HS T ). In the following years several other attempts were made to detect absorption features from exoplanets atmospheres using also groundbased observatories but, until recently, they were able to place\nonly upper limits (Moutou et al. 2001; Snellen 2004; Narita et\nal. 2005). Sodium detection from the ground was first achieved\nfor HD189733b by Redfield et al. (2008) and later confirmed in\nHD209458b by Snellen et al. (2008) who found Na levels which\nmatched HS T values found by Sing et al. (2008). Additionally\nSing et al. (2010) using ground-based narrowband spectrophotometric measurements at the GTC, detected potassium absorption\nin XO-2b, while Wood et al. (2010) detected sodium absorption in WASP-17b by means of transmission spectroscopy at the\nVLT . Recently Snellen et al. (2010) presented further groundbased detection of CO absorption lines in the atmosphere of\nHD209458b. Their refined analysis allowed to isolate for the\n\nfirst time the doppler shift of the planetary spectral lines during the transit, allowing a direct determination of the masses\nboth of the star and the planet, in the same manner as done for\ndouble lined eclipsing binaries. In the course of their analysis,\nSnellen et al. (2010) also noticed that the CO planetary absoption lines appeared blueshifted with respect to the systemic velocity of the host star, a fact that was attributed to the presence\nof superwinds on the planetary surface, flowing from the day to\nthe dark side of the planet and crossing both its equatorial and\npolar regions. However, the planetary orbit of HD209458b was\nassumed to be perfectly circular. The aim of this contribution\nis to analyze which consequences has the presence of a non-null\nplanetary orbital eccentricity on transmission spectroscopy measurements. Even if a residual small orbital eccentricity is present\nthe velocity of the planet during the transit can be expected to be\noffset with respect to the systemic velocity, and by a significant\namount given the large orbital speed of the planet, as demonstrated in Sect. 2. In Sect. 3, we discuss the particular case of\nHD209458b. Finally in Sect. 4, we summarize our results and\nconclude.\n\n1\n\n\fPlease give a shorter version with: \\authorrunning and/or \\titilerunning prior to \\maketitle\n\n2. Transmission spectroscopy of an eccentric\ntransiting planet\nWe assume a two body system composed of a planet and its\nhost star. The radial velocity RV of the planet with respect to\nthe barycenter of the system is given by (e.g. Hilditch 2001):\nRV =\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n(2\u03c0)1/3\n(G)1/3 m s sin(i)\ncos(\u03c9\n+\nf\n)\n+\ne\ncos\u03c9\n, (1)\n\u221a\nP1/3\n1 \u2212 e2 (m s + m p )2/3\n\nwhere f is the true anomaly, e is the eccentricity of the orbit, and\ni is the inclination with respect to the plane of the sky, m s and m p\nare the masses of the star and of the planet, \u03c9 is the longitude of\nthe periastron of the planetary orbit, P is the orbital period, and\nG the gravitational constant. Isolating the terms dependent on\nthe eccentricity and the longitude of the periastron and grouping\nall the others in the constant K\u0303 we obtain:\nRV = K\u0303\n\ncos(\u03c9 + f ) + e cos\u03c9\n.\n\u221a\n1 \u2212 e2\n\n(2)\n\nOnce the planet crosses the line of sight of the observer the term\ndependent on the true anomaly is exactly null, then the radial\nvelocity of the planet in that moment (RV0 ), with respect to the\nbarycentric radial velocity, is given by:\ne cos\u03c9\nRV0 = K\u0303 \u221a\n.\n1 \u2212 e2\n\n(3)\n\nThis velocity is null only if the eccentricity is null or if the longitude of the periastron equals 90\u25e6 (or 270\u25e6). Assuming m s =\n1 M\u2299 , m p = 1 M jup , i = 90\u25e6 , P = 3 days and e = 0.01 we can\nderive the following upper limit for RV0 given that |cos\u03c9| \u22641:\n|RV0 | \u2264 1.48 km/s.\n\n(4)\n\nThis result is totally due to the fact that the orbital speed of the\nplanet is much larger than that one of its stellar companion, given\nits much smaller mass. Since transmission spectroscopy allows\nto sample only a small portion of the planetary orbit close to\nthe mid-transit point, all the measurements acquired during the\ntransit would appear to be offset with respect to the systemic velocity as represented in Fig. 1. Then, considering the case of an\nhot-jupiter, even a small eccentricity can produce a radial velocity offset of the order of the km/s (depending also on the\nvalue of the longitude of the periastron). This offset can be either blueshifted or redshifted. If the eccentricity of the system is\ncompletely neglected, assuming that the orbit is exactly circular,\nthis radial velocity offset may be interpreted as having a different\nphysical origin.\n\n3. The case of HD209458b\nAs reported in the introduction, transmission spectroscopy was\napplied to the case of HD209458b by several authors in the\npast placing useful constraints on the abundances of different\nelements in its atmosphere. Recently Snellen et al. (2010), presented a refined procedure by means of which the orbital motion of the planet during the transit was unveiled for the first\ntime throught the analysis of the doppler effect of CO absorption lines. The signal they detected appeared blueshifted with\nrespect to the systemic velocity of the host star by around 2 km/s\nand the uncertainty estimated by the authors was 1 km/s. The\nauthors then interpreted this blueshifted signal as the evidence\nthat superwinds are flowing on the surface of the planet, from\n2\n\nFig. 1. The continuous lines represent the planetary radial velocity during the transit for different values of the eccentricity\n(e) and the longitude of periastron (\u03c9). In this figure we assumed\nm s = 1 M\u2299 , m p = 1 M jup , i = 90\u25e6 , P = 3 days. The dotted lines\nindicate the mid-transit point and the systemic velocity. The box\nin the lower right corner is a magnified view close to the midtransit point.\nthe dayside to the darkside and crossing both the equator and the\npoles.\nThis conclusion was drawn on the basis of the assumption\nthat the orbit of HD209458b is perfectly circular. High precision\nradial velocities allow to conclude that the eccentricity of this\nsystem is consistent with zero within the uncertainties (Laughlin\net al. 2005). In particular, Laughlin et al. (2005) pointed out that:\n\"even when the orbit underpinning a data set is circular, e computed from an ensemble of bootstrap trials will have a characteristic nonzero value\". Nevertheless considering the uncertainties a residual small eccentricity cannot be ruled out a priori (Kipping 2008) and in the last years this was in fact a matter of large debate. Winn et al. (2005), analyzing high-precision\nradial velocities of the host-star, photometry and timing of the\nsecondary eclipse, obtained for the eccentricity and longitude\nof periastron of the star (\u03c9 s ) the values e = 0.0147 \u00b1 0.0053\nand \u03c9 s = 84\u25e6 \u00b1 11\u25e6 . If these mean values are used in Eq. 3,\nwe obtain an expected blueshifted signal equal to RV0 = 0.21\nkm/s. However, considering the 90% upper confidence limits\n(e cos\u03c9 = 0.0049) reported by Winn et \u221a\nal. (2005) we derive that\nRV0 could be as high as RV0 = 0.68/ 1 \u2212 e2 km/s. Similarly,\nDeming et al. (2005) derived that the secondary eclipse occurs\nat the midpoint between transits within 21 min (3-\u03c3). This translates into an upper limit\n\u221a for the expected radial velocity offset\nequal to RV0 = 0.91/ 1 \u2212 e2 km/s. These estimates appear still\nconsistent with the observed blushifted signal considering the\nuncertainties of the observations.\nThen at present, given the large sensitivity of the mechanism\nhere presented on the orbital eccentricity, and given the uncertainty of the measurements, it is questionable if other mechanisms like superwinds should be invoked to account for the ob-\n\n\fPlease give a shorter version with: \\authorrunning and/or \\titilerunning prior to \\maketitle\n\nof the periastron of the star in the first quadrant (and that one of\nthe planet in the third quadrant).\nFinally, it should be also noted that any conclusion regarding the presence of windflows on planetary surfaces coming\nfrom transmission spectroscopy measurements requires precise\nknown orbital parameters from RV.\nAcknowledgements.

(2005), even a dynamically significant eccentricity (e \u223c 0.03) could be still in agreement with their 3-\u03c3 limit, despite requiring a rather good alignment of the apsidal line with the line of sight |\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c0/2| < 12\u25e6 .\nIf totally attributed to the eccentricity, the observed blueshift\nwould imply that the longitude of the periastron of the planet\n(\u03c9 p ) should lie either in the second or in the third quadrant, and\nconsequently that one of the star (\u03c9 s = \u03c9 p + 180\u25e6 ) either in the\nfourth or in the first quadrant respectively (see Fig. 2). Despite\nthe large uncertainty, Winn et al. (2005) report \u03c9 s = 84\u25e6 \u00b111\u25e6 (1\u03c3). Taken together, the above considerations reinforce the idea\nthat the longitude of the periastron of the star should lie most\nlikely in the first quadrant (and that one of the planet in the third).\n\n4. Conclusions\nThanks to the large orbital speed of planets with respect to their\nstellar companions, transmission spectroscopy allows not only to\nconstrain the properties of the atmosphere of a transiting planet,\nbut also offers an alternative mean to refine its orbital parameters. For the eccentric planet Gj436b (P = 2.6438986 days,\ne =0.15, \u03c9 s = 351\u25e6) we expect a redshifted radial velocity offset\nequal to 11.68 km/s. For the particular case of HD209458b, nominally almost half of the blueshifted signal reported by Snellen\net al. (2010) could be explained assuming that the orbital eccentricity of the system is not exactly null (just at the percent level)\nconsidering the limits imposed by transit timing of the secondary\neclipse given by Deming et al. (2005). However, given the uncertainty of the measurements of Snellen et al. (2010), our estimates\nappear still consistent with the observations. Once attributed to\nthe eccentricity, the blueshifted signal together with radial velocity measurements of the host star, allow to confine the longitude\n3\n\n\f"}
