Such interactions may give rise to complicated spatial orderings and produce\ncomplex and rich critical behavior [1]. The transitions between ordered and disordered phases may be continuous or\nof first order with a tricritical point between them, but no general classification exists, connecting the symmetry of\nspin structures and the range of interaction with the expected critical behavior. The Ising square lattice with nearestneighbor coupling (nn) is an exactly soluble model [2] and almost all its properties are well known. With the addition\nof next-nearest-neighbor (nnn) interactions the problem is no longer exactly soluble and several approximate methods\nhave been applied to attack this more general problem and to understand the effect of adding the nnn-coupling on the\ncritical behavior of the system [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. Of particular interest is the case of competing interactions, where\nthe ground state is an arrangement with superantiferromagnetic (SAF) order in which ferromagnetic rows (columns)\nalternate with opposite oriented spins. The T = 0 phase diagram is well known [5, 6, 7] and the SAF-order can be\nobtained in both cases of a ferromagnetic or an antiferromagnetic nn-coupling. The system, in zero-field, is governed\nby the Hamiltonian:\nX\nX\nSi Sj\n(1)\nSi Sj + Jnnn\nH = Jnn\n<i,j>\n\n(i,j)\n\nwhere here both nearest-neighbor (Jnn ) and next nearest-neighbor (Jnnn ) interactions will be assumed to be positive\n(antiferromagnetic) and the system as is well known [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] develops at low temperatures superantiferromagnetic order for R > 0.5.\nSeveral previous studies have suggested that the above system may possess \"anomalous\" exponents, and a nonuniversal critical behavior with exponents depending on the coupling ratio R = Jnnn /Jnn has been the commonly\naccepted scenario for many years [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. However, recently the interest on the subject has been renewed\nand some attempts to re-examine the behavior of this model have taken place. In several papers Lopez et.al [10, 11, 12]\nhave used the cluster variation method (CVM) to study this model and have concluded that the system undergoes a\nfirst-order transition for a particular range of the coupling ratio (0.5-1.2). Thus, a different scenario predicting first\norder transitions between ordered and disordered phases, followed by continuous transitions outside the first-order\nregion has been proposed [10, 11, 12]. It appears that this scenario has been further supported by the study of Buzano\nand Pretti [13]. These authors studied the same model with an additional 4-body coupling using again the CVM\nand concluded that according to this method a first-order behavior is expected for a very large part of the parameter\nspace reproducing also the results of [10, 11, 12]. However, they also considered the limiting case (Jnn = 0), where\nthe exact solution of Baxter model [14] applies, observing again a large part of the parameter space in which the\n\n\u2217 Corresponding\n\nauthor: amalakis@cc.uoa.gr\n\n\f2\nCVM predicts first-order behavior. Thus, the CVM fails to predict the true second order critical behavior for the\nBaxter model and, this is of course, an obvious reason for suspecting the CVM. It is quite possible that the CVM, in\nany finite-order approximation, could produce misleading \"mean-field\" behavior not unlikely with other variational\nmethods [15]. Yet, the relevant questions are very important for a better understanding of the critical behavior of\nsystems with competing interactions. Notwithstanding that, a recent Monte Carlo simulation [16] of a quite \"similar\nmodel\" has provided strong evidence of first order behavior. This last model includes nn- and nnn-antiferromagnetic\ncouplings but now the model is defined on the triangular lattice. Having to deal with the same hamiltonian and a\nsimilar ground state arrangement (SAF-arrangement) one should naively expect the same critical behavior for the two\nmodels, assuming a simple universality in which the underlying lattice is immaterial in 2D. In the light of the above\ncontroversial and at the moment unsettled situation, it is of interest to follow again the traditional finite-size scaling\nanalysis to re-examine the above prediction. As a first attempt, we study here the square model for a particular value\nof the coupling ratio, R = 1, included in the above range, and using a new complementary and efficient numerical\nmethod we generate accurate finite-size data for quite large lattices. The rest of the paper is organized as follows.\nIn the next section we outline the entropic sampling technique implemented here to generate numerical estimates\naccurate in the critical region for the case R = 1. In section 3 we explain why our numerical data are not supporting a\nfirst-order transition and then we present a finite-size analysis, yielding accurate estimates for the critical exponents.\nThese are compared with estimates existing in literature and an old conjecture of K. Binder and D. P. Landau [5]\nassuming \"weak universality\" is reinforced. Our conclusions are summarized in section 4.\nII.\n\nTHE CRMES WANG-LANDAU ENTROPIC SAMPLING SCHEME\n\nTraditional Monte Carlo sampling methods have been used for many years in the study of critical phenomena [17]\nand the first Monte Carlo approaches to the present model were indeed carried out by the Metropolis method [4, 5, 6].\nOn the other hand, general flat histogram methods [17, 18, 19, 20] are alternatives to importance sampling and are\nexpected to be much more efficient for studying a complex system. A simple and efficient entropic implementation\nof the Wang-Landau(WL) method has been presented recently by the present authors. This method is based on a\nsystematic restriction of the energy space as we increase the lattice size. The random walk of this entropic simulation\ntakes place only in the appropriately restricted energy space and this restriction produces an immense speed up of all\npopular algorithms calculating the density of energy states (DOS) of a statistical system [21, 22]. For the temperature\nrange of interest, that is the range around a critical point, this scheme determines all finite-size anomalies using\nan one-run entropic strategy employing what we have called the \"critical minimum energy subspace Wang-Landau\n(CrMES WL)-entropic sampling method\". In this approach all (thermal and magnetic) properties are obtained by\nusing the high-levels (that is the levels where the detailed-balanced condition is quite well obeyed) of the Wang-Landau\nrandom walk process to determine appropriate microcanonical estimators. The method is efficiently combined with\nthe N-fold way [19] in order to improve statistical reliability but also to produce broad-histogram (BH) estimators for\nan additional calculation of the density of states (DOS).\nThe approximation of canonical averages, in a temperature range of interest, is as follows:\nhQi =\n\nP\n\nG(E)e\u2212\u03b2E \u223c\n=\n\u2212\u03b2E\nE G(E)e\n\nhQi\nE\nP E\n\nP\n\ne\n\nE\u2208(E1 ,E2 ) hQiE,W L G(E)e\n\nP\n\nE\u2208(E1 ,E2 )\n\n\u2212\u03b2E\n\n\u2212\u03b2E\ne\nG(E)e\n\n(2)\n\nThe restricted energy subspace (E1 , E2 ) is carefully chosen to cover the temperature range of interest without\nintroducing observable errors. The microcanonical averages hQiE are determined from the HW L (E, Q)-histograms,\nwhich are obtained during the high-levels of the WL-process:\nhQiE \u223c\n= hQiE,W L \u2261\n\nX\nQ\n\nQ\n\nX\nHW L (E, Q)\n, HW L (E) =\nHW L (E, Q)\nHW L (E)\n\n(3)\n\nQ\n\nand the summations run over all values generated in the restricted energy subspace (E1 , E2 ). Finally, the approximate\ne\ndensity of states used in (2) is obtained from the DOS generated after the last WL-iteration (G(E)\n= GW L (E)) or\ne\nfrom the broad-histogram (BH) approximation (G(E)\n= GBH (E)). This last approximation may be easily calculated\nfrom appropriate microcanonical averages corresponding also to the high-levels of the WL-process, since in the N-fold\nimplementation of the WL-process the necessary histograms for the application of the broad-histogram method [20]\nare also known. As mentioned above, the updating of appropriate histograms (Q may be any power of the order\nparameter or some other quantity) is carried out only in the high-levels of the WL-process. In these stages, the\nincomplete detailed-balance condition has not significant effect on the microcanonical estimators constructed from\n\n\f3\nthe cumulative histograms as shown in [22]. Thus we have used only the WL-iterations: j = 12 \u2212 24 for lattices up\nto L = 100 and the WL-iterations: j = 16 \u2212 26 for larger lattices. The p\ninitial modification factor of the WL-process\nis taken to be f1 = e = 2.718... and, as usual, we follow the rule fj+1 = fj and a 5% flatness criterion [21, 22]. The\nrest of the details and the N-fold implementation can be found in [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22].\nIn the present implementation of the CrMES method we restrict the total energy range (Emin , Emax ) to the\nminimum energy-subspace producing an accurate estimation for all finite-size anomalies. This restriction may be\ndefined by requesting a specified accuracy on a diverging specific heat (or on a diverging susceptibility) as shown in\n[22]. Alternatively, the energy density function may be used in a simpler way to restrict the energy space. Thus, if \u1ebc\ne\u00b1 ) of the\nis the value maximizing the probability density, at some pseudocritical temperature (TL\u2217 ), the end-points (E\nenergy critical subspaces (CrMES) may be located by the condition:\ne\u00b1 :\nE\n\nPEe \u00b1 (TL\u2217 )\nPEe (TL\u2217 )\n\n\u2264r\n\n(4)\n\nwhere r is chosen to be a small number, independent of the lattice size. Both r = 10\u22124 and r = 10\u22126 have been\nused in the present study to estimate the relevant extensions of critical subspaces as discussed bellow. The resulting\ne , obey the \"specific-heat\" scaling law [21]:\nfinite-size extensions of critical energy subspaces, denoted by (\u2206E)\n\u03a8\u2261\n\ne 2\n\u03b1\n(\u2206E)\n\u2248 L\u03bd\nLd\n\n(5)\n\nSince the extensions of these energy subspaces satisfy very well the above scaling law, relation (5) is a new route for\nestimating the critical exponent \u03b1/\u03bd [21, 22]. Furthermore, following a similar procedure we may also estimate the\nf be the value maximizing the order parameter density at\ncritical exponent \u03b3/\u03bd, as already shown in [22]. Again, let M\nf\u00b1 )\nsome pseudocritical temperature, for instance at the susceptibility pseudocritical temperature. The end-points (M\nof the magnetic critical subspaces (CrMMS) are located by the condition:\nf\u00b1 :\nM\n\n\u2217\nPM\nf\u00b1 (TL )\n\u2217\nPM\nf (TL )\n\n\u2264r\n\n(6)\n\nand the corresponding finite-size extensions of critical magnetic subspaces obey close to a critical point, the \"susceptibility\" scaling law [22] :\n\u039e\u2261\n\nf)2\n\u03b3\n(\u2206M\n\u2248 L\u03bd\nLd\n\n(7)\n\nEquations (equations (5) and (7)) provide additional routes for estimating the involved critical exponents.\nIII.\n\nNUMERICAL EVIDENCE. FINITE - SIZE SCALING ANALYSIS.\n\nLet us first present an illustrative graph showing that the above-described entropic scheme yields accurate data\nfor the application of finite-size scaling. We have used two different definitions for the order parameter. With the\nhelp of four sublattices of the SAF-ordering one may define a two-component order parameter and finally use its\nroot-mean-square (rms) as done in [5].\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\nMSAF = {M1 + M2 \u2212 (M3 + M4 )} /4, MSAF = {M1 + M4 \u2212 (M2 + M3 )} /4\nr\u0010\n\u00112 \u0010\n\u00112\n(rms)\n(1)\n(2)\nMSAF =\nMSAF + MSAF\n\n(8)\n\nWe have used this rms orderP\nparameter and also, as an alternative, the sum of the absolute values of the four sublattice\n4\nmagnetizations (MSAF =\ni=1 |Mi | /4). The resulting behavior is very similar and the finite size extensions of\nthe resulting CrMMS completely coincide supporting the identity of the two representations for the present system.\nTherefore, for large lattices only the second order parameter was used. For a particular temperature, T = 2.082 , close\nto the critical temperature, we have calculated using long runs of the Metropolis algorithm several thermodynamic\nproperties of the system for R = 1 and we have found good agreement with the corresponding estimates obtained via\nthe entropic scheme described in the previous section. Figure 1 provides a comparison test between the Metropolis\nalgorithm and entropic scheme. Let us consider the estimates of the Metropolis simulation for the susceptibility at the\n\n\f4\nabove mentioned temperature as being the exact values. Then figure 1 presents the variation of the \"relative errors\" of\nthe entropic scheme with lattice size and compare these with the statistical errors of the Metropolis simulation. From\nthis figure it can be seen that the CrMES-WL entropic scheme provides estimates in the expected range. We conclude\nthat similar accuracy should be expected for the temperature-range covered by the restricted energy subspaces.\ne\nNext, we search (using the approximate DOS: G(E))\nfor a double peak in the energy probability density which\nshould be expected if the system undergoes a first-order transition as predicted by CVM. For R = 1, using small\ntemperature steps close to the specific heat pseudocritical temperatures, we did not observe such double peaks. In\ncontrast when we used our algorithm to generate the appropriate DOS of the triangular (SAF) model considered by\nRasteli et. al [16], the presence of the energy double-peaks reported by these authors was very clear. The finite-size\nbehavior of the fourth-order cumulant (of the order parameter) is indicative for the order of the transition [23, 24]. We\nused this test in order to observe the behavior for the square lattice model and to examine the prediction for a firstorder transition reported by Lopez et al. [10, 11, 12]. Comparing by this test the two models we had the opportunity\nto observe that the difference in the cumulant-behavior between them was again profound. For the triangular model\nthe behavior was in very good agreement with that reported in [16] indicating a first-order transition, while for the\npresent square model a behavior characteristic of a second order critical point was observed [23]. It appears that the\nfirst-order prediction of the CVM is false at least for the case R = 1. The tricritical point, if it exists, could be in\na lower temperature and the upper bound (1.2) given by Lopez et al. [10, 11, 12] could be an overestimation of the\nCVM.\nFigure 2 presents the order-parameter cumulant behavior of the square lattice model for several lattice sizes close\nto the critical temperature. From this graph and by using the crossing method [23] we have estimated the critical\ntemperature. Taking the average of all the crossing temperatures included in figure 2 we find: Tc = 2.0823(17).\nIncluding in this averaging the smaller sizes L = 30 \u2212 60 the estimate is: Tc = 2.0821(13). Thus, Tc = 2.0823(17)\nseems quite safe and it is also in good agreement with the estimates obtained by fitting the specific heat, susceptibility\nand energy-cumulant pseudocritical temperatures to a power law behavior with a correction term:\nTL = Tc + \u03b1L\u2212\u03bb (1 +\n\nb\n)\nL\n\n(9)\n\nThe above-mentioned fits, not shown for brevity, yielded respectively: (Tc = 2.0825(5), \u03bb = 1.20(4)), (Tc =\n2.0828(8), \u03bb = 1.197(50)) and (Tc = 2.0818(8), \u03bb = 1.158(60))\nLet us now try to estimate the magnetic critical exponent \u03b3/\u03bd. We employ the commonly used route of fitting\nthe values of the susceptibility peaks and/or its values at the critical temperature (Tc = 2.0823) to observe the\nscaling exponent. Figure 3 presents three scaling fitting attempts assuming a simple power law. The peaks of the\nsusceptibility yield an estimate of the order 1.79, while the susceptibility values at the estimated critical temperature\nprovide an estimate of the order 1.71. The exponent appears to acquire a value in this wide range (\u03b3/\u03bd = 1.71 \u2212 1.79)\nif we vary the lattice sizes fitted and/or if we add corrections terms to the simple power law. Note that the estimated\nin [5] range is 1.71 \u00b1 0.15. The middle solid line in figure 3 shows that the average of the susceptibility in the two\ntemperatures (Tc and TL\u2217 (\u03c7)) gives an estimate very close to the 2D-Ising value (\u03b3/\u03bd = 1.75). These observations\nseem to favor the original view of [5] that the system may obey a kind of \"weak universality\" [25]. According to this\nhypothesis the reduced exponent \u03b3/\u03bd will have the 2D-Ising value independent of R. To further check this conjecture\nf) in equation (7). Figure 4 shows the behavior of\nlet us analyze the scaling behavior of the finite-size extensions (\u2206M\n\u2217\nthese scaled extensions in the two temperatures Tc and TL (\u03c7)) together with the behavior of their average. Fitting\nthe numerical data to a law of the form:\ny = \u03b1Lw (1 +\n\nb\n)\nL\n\n(10)\n\nwe obtain very good fits and the estimates of \u03b3/\u03bd are for the three curves in the range w = 1.75 \u00b1 0.01. Thus, the\nscenario of weak universality of \u03b3/\u03bd = 1.75 is greatly reinforced.\nFrequently, the scaling of the specific heat is a difficult task but for the present model we have discovered that the\nscaling behavior of the average of our estimates in the two temperatures (Tc and TL\u2217 (C)) is quite stable as one varies\nthe lattice size. Figure 5 shows details of the fit for the \"averaged\" specific heat values and figures 6 and 7 show the\ne appearing in equation (5). Comparing the last two fits we find a unique\nanalysis of the scaled extensions (\u03a8(\u2206E))\ncase of stability and we confidently estimate:\n\u03b1\n= 0.412 \u00b1 0.005\n\u03bd\n\n(11)\n\nThe above findings (estimate (11) and the weak universality \u03b3/\u03bd = 1.75) may now be used to determine a consistent scheme for all critical exponents. Assuming hyperscaling, the correlation length exponent is estimated as\n\n\f5\n\u03bd = 0.8292(24) and this value is consistent ( \u03bd1 = \u03bb) with the estimates of the shift exponent found from the pseudocritical temperatures. The exponent \u03b2/\u03bd should therefore be 0.125. A power law fit of our estimates of the order\nparameter at the critical temperature are in a good agreement with this value. The proposed set of exponents satisfies\nall scaling laws for a second order transition as can be easily verified.\nIV.\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nIn this paper we have considered the square-lattice Ising model with nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic interactions and found that the prediction of the cluster variation method of a first-order transition is not\nsupported by the finite size behavior of the system (R = 1). The original scenario [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] of a non-universal\ncritical behavior with exponents depending on the coupling ratio has been strongly reinforced by our numerical study\nand \"weak universality\" [5, 25] seems to be well obeyed. The idea of using scaled extensions of dominant critical subspaces to estimate the thermal exponent \u03b1/\u03bd and the magnetic exponent \u03b3/\u03bd seems to supply a quite accurate route\nfor exponent estimation. In the present case the accurate estimation by this route of the thermal exponent is almost\nunique. Furthermore, the successful application of the scaling law (7) has been a helpful guidance in observing the\n\"weak universality\" of the magnetic critical exponents. The entropic sampling scheme applied in this study provides\na better evaluation of the tail behavior of the critical distributions and this seems to be of importance for the accurate\nestimation of the finite-size extensions of the dominant subspaces used for the exponent estimation.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThis research was supported by the Special Account for Research Grants of the University of Athens under Grant\nNos. 70/4/4071.\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n[22]\n[23]\n[24]\n[25]\n\nPhase Tansitions and Critical Phenomena (ed.
