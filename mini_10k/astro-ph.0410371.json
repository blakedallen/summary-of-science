One of the major uncertainties is the exact chemical state of the star forming gas and its influence on the\ndynamical evolution. Most simulations of star forming clusters use an isothermal equation of state (EOS). We address these issues and study the effect of a\npiecewise polytropic EOS on the formation of stellar clusters in turbulent, selfgravitating molecular clouds using three-dimensional, smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations. In these simulations stars form via a process we call\ngravoturbulent fragmentation, i.e., gravitational fragmentation of turbulent gas.\nTo approximate the results of published predictions of the thermal behavior of\ncollapsing clouds, we increase the polytropic exponent \u03b3 from 0.7 to 1.1 at some\nchosen density nc , which we vary from from 4.3 \u00d7 104 cm\u22123 to 4.3 \u00d7 107 cm\u22123 .\nThe change of thermodynamic state at nc selects a characteristic mass scale for\nfragmentation Mch , which we relate to the peak of the observed IMF. We find\na relation Mch \u221d nc\u22120.5\u00b10.1 . Our investigation supports the idea that the distribution of stellar masses largely depends on the thermodynamic state of the\nstar-forming gas. The thermodynamic state of interstellar gas is a result of the\nbalance between heating and cooling processes, which in turn are determined by\nfundamental atomic and molecular physics and by chemical abundances. Given\nthe abundances, the derivation of a characteristic stellar mass may thus be based\non universal quantities and constants.\n\n\f2\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nAlthough the IMF has been derived from vastly different regions, from the\nsolar vicinity to dense clusters of newly formed stars, the basic features seem to\nbe strikingly universal to all determinations (Kroupa 2001). Initial conditions\nin star forming regions can vary considerably. If the IMF depends on the initial\nconditions, there would thus be no reason for it to be universal. Therefore a\nderivation of the characteristic stellar mass that is based on fundamental atomic\nand molecular physics would be more consistent.\nThere are many ways to approach the formation of stars and star clusters\nfrom a theoretical point of view. In particular models that connect stellar\nbirth to the turbulent motions ubiquiteously observed in Galactic molecular\nclouds have become increasingly popular in recent years. See, e.g., the reviews by Larson (2003) and Mac Low & Klessen (2004). The interplay between turbulent motion and self-gravity of the cloud leads to a process we call\ngravoturbulent fragmentation: Supersonic turbulence generates strong density\nfluctuations with gravity taking over in the densest and most massive regions\n(e.g. Larson 1981; Fleck 1982; Padoan 1995; Padoan et al. 1997; Klessen et al.\n1998, 2000; Klessen 2001; Padoan & Nordlund 2002). Once gas clumps become gravitationally unstable, collapse sets in. The central density increases\nand soon individual or whole clusters of protostellar objects form and grow in\nmass via accretion from their infalling envelopes.\nHowever, most current results are based on models that do not treat thermal\nphysics in detail. Typically, a simple isothermal equation of state (EOS) is\nused. The true nature of the EOS, thus, remains a major theoretical problem in\nunderstanding the fragmentation properties of molecular clouds.\nRecently Li et al. (2003) conducted a systematic study of the effects of a\nvarying polytropic exponent \u03b3 on gravoturbulent fragmentation. Their results\nshowed that \u03b3 determines how strongly self-gravitating gas fragments. They\nfound that the degree of fragmentation decreases with increasing polytropic\nexponent \u03b3 in the range 0.2 < \u03b3 < 1.4 although the total amount of mass\nin collapsed cores appears to remain roughly consistent through this range.\nThese findings suggest that the IMF might be quite sensitive to the thermal\nphysics. However in their computations, \u03b3 was left strictly constant in each\ncase. Here we study the effects of using a piecewise polytropic equation of\nstate and investigate if a change in \u03b3 determines the characteristic mass of the\ngas clump spectrum and thus, possibly, the turn-over mass of the IMF.\n\n2.\n\nThermal Properties of Star-Forming Clouds\n\nObservational evidence predicts that dense prestellar cloud cores show rough\nbalance between gravity and thermal pressure (Benson & Myers 1989; Myers et al.\n1991). Thus, the thermodynamical properties of the gas play an important role\n\n\fIMF from non-isothermal fragmentation\n\n3\n\nin determining how dense star-forming regions in molecular clouds collapse\nand fragment. Observational and theoretical studies of the thermal properties\nof collapsing clouds both indicate that at densities below 10\u221218 g cm\u22123 , roughly\ncorresponding to a number density of n = 2.5 \u00d7 105 cm\u22123 , the temperature\ndecreases with increasing density. This is due to the strong dependence of\nmolecular cooling rates on density (Koyama & Inutsuka 2000). Therefore, the\npolytropic exponent \u03b3 is below unity in this density regime. At densities above\n10\u221218 g cm\u22123 , the gas becomes thermally coupled to the dust grains, which then\ncontrol the temperature by far-infrared thermal emission. The balance between\ncompressional heating and thermal cooling by dust causes the temperature to\nincrease again slowly with increasing density. Thus the temperature-density\nrelation can be approximated with \u03b3 above unity in this regime (Larson this\nvolume; see also Larson 1985; Spaans & Silk 2000). Changing \u03b3 from a value\nbelow unity to a value above unity results in a minimum temperature at the critical density. As shown by Li et al. (2003), gas fragments efficiently for \u03b3 < 1.0\nand less efficiently for higher \u03b3. Thus, the Jeans mass at the critical density\ndefines a characteristic mass for fragmentation, which may be related to the\npeak of the IMF.\n\n3.\n\nNumerical Approach\n\nTo gain insight into how molecular cloud fragmentation the characteristic stellar mass may depend on the critical density we perform a series of\nsmoothed particle hydrodynamics calculations of the gravitational fragmentation of supersonically turbulent molecular clouds using the parallel code GADGET designed by Springel et al. (2001). SPH is a Lagrangian method, where\nthe fluid is represented by an ensemble of particles, and flow quantities are\nobtained by averaging over an appropriate subset of SPH particles, see Benz\n(1990) and Monaghan (1992). The method is able to resolve large density contrasts as particles are free to move, and so naturally the particle concentration\nincreases in high-density regions. We use the Bate & Burkert (1997) criterion\nthe resolution limit of our calculations. It is adequate for the problem considered here, where we follow the evolution of highly nonlinear density fluctuations created by supersonic turbulence. We replace the central high-density\nregions of collapsing gas cores by sink particles (Bate et al. 1995). These particles have the ability to accrete gas from their surroundings while keeping track\nof mass and momentum. This enables us to follow the dynamical evolution of\nthe system over many local free-fall timescales.\nWe compute models where the polytropic exponent changes from \u03b3 = 0.7 to\n\u03b3 = 1.1 for critical densities in the range 4.3 \u00d7 104 cm\u22123 \u2264 nc \u2264 4.3 \u00d7 107 cm\u22123 .\nEach simulation starts with a uniform density distribution, and turbulence is\ndriven on large scales, with wave numbers k in the range 1 \u2264 k < 2. We\n\n\f4\n\nFigure 1.\nMass spectra of protostellar cores for four models with critical densities in the\nrange 4.3 \u00d7 104 cm\u22123 \u2264 nc \u2264 4.3 \u00d7 107 cm\u22123 . We show two phases of evolution, when about\n10% and 30% of the mass has been accreted onto protostars. The vertical solid line shows the\nmedian mass of the distribution. The dotted line serves as a reference to the Salpeter (1955)\nslope of the observed IMF at high masses. The dashed line indicates our mass resolution limit.\n\nuse the same driving field in all four models. The global free-fall timescale is\n\u03c4ff \u2248 105 yr. For further details see Jappsen et al. (2004).\n\n\fIMF from non-isothermal fragmentation\n\n5\n\nFigure 2. Plot of the median mass of the protostellar cores Mmedian versus critical density nc .\nWe display results for different ratios of accreted gas mass to total gas mass Macc /Mtot , and fit\nthe data with straight lines. Their slopes take the values \u22120.43 \u00b1 0.05 (solid line), \u22120.52 \u00b1 0.06\n(dashed-dotted line), and \u22120.60 \u00b1 0.07 (dashed line), respectively.\n\n4.\n\nDependency of the Characteristic Mass\n\nTo illustrate the effects of varying the critical density, we plot in Fig. 1 the\nresulting mass spectra at different times when the fraction of of mass accumulated in protostellar objects has reached approximately 10% and 30%. This\nrange of efficiencies corresponds roughly to the one expected for regions of\nclustered star formation (Lada & Lada 2003). In the top-row model, the change\nin \u03b3 occurs below the initial mean density. It shows a flat distribution with only\nfew, but massive cores. These reach masses up to 10 M\u2299 and the minimum\nmass is about 0.3 M\u2299 . The mass spectrum becomes more peaked for higher nc\nand shifts to lower masses.\nWe find closest correspondence with the observed IMF (Scalo 1998; Kroupa\n2002; Chabrier 2003) for a critical density nc of 4.3 \u00d7 106 cm\u22123 and for stages\nof accretion around 30%. For high masses, the distribution exhibits a (Salpeter\n1955) power-law behavior. For masses about the median mass the distribution\nhas a small plateau and then falls off towards smaller masses.\nThe change of median mass Mmedian with critical density nc is quantified in\nFig. 2. As nc increases Mmedian decreases. We fit our data with straight lines.\nThe slopes take values between \u22120.4 and \u22120.6.\n\n\f6\n\n5.\n\nDiscussion and Summary\n\nUsing SPH simulations we investigate the influence of a piecewise polytropic EOS on the gravoturbulent fragmentation of molecular clouds. We study\nthe case where the polytropic index \u03b3 changes from 0.7 to 1.1 at a critical density nc , and consider the range 4.3 \u00d7 104 cm\u22123 \u2264 nc \u2264 4.3 \u00d7 107 cm\u22123 .\nA simple scaling argument based on the Jeans mass MJ at the critical density\nnc leads to MJ \u221d n\u22120.95\n(see Jappsen et al. 2004). If there is a close relation bec\ntween the average Jeans mass and the gravoturbulent fragmentation spectrum,\na similar relation should hold for the characteristic mass Mch of protostellar\ncores. Our simulations qualitatively support this hypothesis, however, with the\nweaker density dependency Mch \u221d n\u22120.5\u00b10.1\n. So indeed, the density at which \u03b3\nc\nchanges from below unity to above unity defines a preferred mass scale. Consequently, the peak of the resulting mass spectrum decreases with increasing\ncritical density. The distribution not only shows a pronounced maximum but\nalso a power-law tail towards higher masses, similar to the observed IMF.\nAltogether, supersonic turbulence in self-gravitating molecular gas generates a complex network of interacting filaments. The overall density distribution is highly inhomogeneous. Turbulent compression sweeps up gas in some\nparts of the cloud, but other regions become rarefied. The fragmentation behavior of the cloud and its ability to form stars depend on the EOS. However,\nonce collapse sets in, the final mass of a fragment depends not only on the\nlocal Jeans criterion, but also on additional processes. For example, protostars\ngrow in mass by accretion from their surrounding material. In turbulent clouds\nthe properties of the gas reservoir are continuously changing. And in addition\nprotostars may interact with each other, leading to ejection or mass exchange.\nThese dynamical factors modify the resulting mass spectrum, and may explain\nwhy the characteristic stellar mass depends on the EOS more weakly than expected from simple Jeans-mass scaling arguments.\nOur investigation supports the idea that the distribution of stellar masses\ndepends, at least in part, on the thermodynamic state of the star-forming gas.\nIf there is a low-density regime in molecular clouds where the temperature\nT sinks with increasing density \u03c1, followed by a higher-density phase where\nT increases with \u03c1, fragmentation seems likely to be favored at the transition\ndensity where the temperature reaches a minimum. This defines a characteristic mass scale. The thermodynamic state of interstellar gas is a result of the\nbalance between heating and cooling processes, which in turn are determined\nby fundamental atomic and molecular physics and by chemical abundances.\nThe theoretical derivation of a characteristic stellar mass may thus be based on\nquantities and constants that depend mostly on the chemical abundances in the\nstar-lpwh klforming cloud.\n\n\fBibliography\nBate, M.
