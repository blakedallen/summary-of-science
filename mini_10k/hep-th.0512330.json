By now it is clear that in order to understand the conjectured duality better it is\nnecessary to develop powerful approaches to study of field (string) dynamics in AdS space as well\nas conformal field theory. Light-cone approach is one of the promising approaches which might be\nhelpful to understand AdS/CFT duality better. As is well known, quantization of Green-Schwarz\nsuperstrings propagating in flat space is straightforward only in the light-cone gauge. Since, by\nanalogy with flat space, we expect that a quantization of the Green-Schwarz AdS superstring\nwith a Ramond - Ramond charge [2] will be straightforward only in the light-cone gauge [3], it\nseems that from the stringy perspective of AdS/CF T correspondence the light-cone approach to\nconformal field theory is the fruitful direction to go. Light-cone formulation of totally symmetric\nconformal fundamental fields with canonical conformal dimension and shadow fields was obtained\nin [4]. In this letter we develop light-cone formulation for conformal fundamental and shadow\nfields with arbitrary conformal dimension and arbitrary type of symmetry (totally symmetric and\nmixed symmetry).\nLet us first formulate the main problem we solve in this letter. Conformal fundamental fields in\nd\u22121 dimensional space-time are associated with representations of SO(d\u22121, 2) group labelled by\n\u2206, eigenvalue of the dilatation operator, and by h = (h1 , . . . h\u03bd ), \u03bd = [ d\u22121\n], which is the highest\n2\nweight of the unitary representation of the SO(d \u2212 1) group. The highest weights hi are integers\nand half-integers for bosonic and fermionic fileds respectively. The conformal dimension \u2206 and h\nsatisfy the restriction\n(1.1)\n\u2206 \u2265 \u22060 ,\nwhere the canonical conformal dimension \u22060 is given by1\n\n\u22060 = hk \u2212 k \u2212 2 + d ,\n\n(1.2)\n\nand a number k is defined from the relation2\nh1 = . . . = hk > hk+1 \u2265 hk+2 \u2265 . . . \u2265 h\u03bd \u2265 0,\n\n(1.3)\n\nwhere for odd d the weight h\u03bd should be replaced by |h\u03bd | (see e.g.[6]). Another representations of\nthe conformal group associated with so called shadow fields have eigenvalue of dilatation operator\n \u0303 given by\n\u2206\n \u0303 = d \u2212 1 \u2212\u2206.\n\u2206\n(1.4)\n\nBosonic (fermionic) fields with h = (h1 , 0, . . . , 0) (h = (h1 , 1/2, . . . , 1/2, h\u03bd ), h\u03bd = \u00b11/2 for\nodd d, h\u03bd = 1/2 for even d) are referred to as totally symmetric conformal fundamental and\nshadow fields 3 . In manifestly Lorentz covariant formulation the bosonic(fermionic) totally symmetric conformal and shadow fields are described by a set of the tensor (tensor-spinor) fields whose\n1\n\nUnitarity restriction (1.2) of the so(d \u2212 1, 2) algebra for the cases d = 4, 5 was studied in [5, 6] and for arbitrary\nd in [7]. For discussion of unitary representations of various superalgebras see e.g.[8, 9].\n2\nThe labels hi are the standard Gelfand-Zeitlin labels. They are related with Dynkin labels hD\ni by formula:\nD\nD\nD\n(h1 , hD\n,\n.\n.\n.\n,\nh\n,\nh\n)\n=\n(h\n\u2212\nh\n,\nh\n\u2212\nh\n,\n.\n.\n.\n,\nh\n\u2212\nh\n,\nh\n+\nh\n).\n1\n2\n2\n3\n\u03bd\u22121\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\u22121\n\u03bd\n2\n\u03bd\u22121\n\u03bd\n3\nWe note that \u2206 = d \u2212 2, h = (1, 0, . . . , 0) and \u2206 = d \u2212 1, h = (2, 0, . . . , 0) correspond to conserved vector\ncurrent and conserved traceless spin two tensor field (energy-momentum tensor) respectively. Conserved conformal\n \u0303 = 2 \u2212 s,\ncurrents can be built from massless scalar, spinor and spin 1 fields (see e.g. [10]). The shadow fields with \u2206\nh = (s, 0, . . . , 0) can be used to formulate higher derivatives conformally invariant equations of motion for spin s\ntotally symmetric tensor fields (see e.g. [11]-[14]). Discussion of conformally invariant equations for mixed symmetry\ntensor fields with discrete \u2206 may be found in [15].\n\n2\n\n\fSO(d \u2212 2, 1) space-time tensor indices have the structure of the respective Young tableauxes with\none row. Lorentz covariant description of totally symmetric arbitrary spin conformal fundamental\n \u0303 = d \u2212 1 \u2212 \u22060 is well known. Light-cone description\nfields with \u2206 = \u22060 and shadow fields with \u2206\nof such fields was developed in [4]. Bosonic (fermionic) fields with h2 > 0 (|h2 | > 1/2) are\nreferred to as mixed symmetry fields. In this paper we develop light-cone formulation of CFT [4]\nwhich is applicable to description of mixed symmetry conformal fundamental (and shadow) fields\nwith arbitrary conformal dimension \u2206 > \u22060 and for arbitrary space dimensions.\nRemarkable feature of light-cone approach to CFT we exploit is that number of physical spin\nD.o.F. of massless field in d-dimensional space-time coincides with the number of independent\nspin degrees of freedom of the corresponding conformal fundamental field (and shadow field) with\n\u2206 = \u22060 in d \u2212 1 -dimensional space-time4 . The same coincidence holds true for massive field\nin d-dimensional space and the corresponding conformal fundamental field (and shadow field) in\nd \u2212 1-dimensional space with anomalous conformal dimension, \u2206 > \u22060 . It is this fact that allows\nus to develop the representation for generators of the conformal algebra so(d\u22121, 2) acting in space\nof conformal fundamental and shadow fields in terms of spin operators which enters in light-cone\ngauge description of fields propagating in AdS space time. This is a reason why we refer to such\nrepresentation for CFT generators as AdS friendly representation.\n\n2 Light-cone from of field dynamics in AdS space\nIn order to demonstrate explicit parallel between light-cone formulation of field dynamics in AdS\nspace and that of conformal field theory we begin with discussion of light-cone formulation of field\ndynamics in AdS space developed in [4, 16]. Let \u03c6(x) be a bosonic arbitrary spin field propagating\nin AdSd space. If we collect spin degrees of freedom in a ket-vector |\u03c6i then a light-cone gauge\naction for \u03c6 can be cast into the following form[4]5\nZ\n1\n1\nSl.c. =\ndd xh\u03c6|(\u2737 \u2212 2 A)|\u03c6i ,\n\u2737 = 2\u2202 + \u2202 \u2212 + \u2202 i \u2202 i + \u2202z2 .\n(2.1)\n2\nz\nAn operator A being independent of space-time coordinates and their derivatives is referred to as\nAdS mass operator. This operator acts only on spin indices of |\u03c6i.\nWe turn now to discussion of global so(d\u22121, 2) symmetries of the light-cone gauge action. The\nchoice of the light-cone gauge spoils the manifest global symmetries, and in order to demonstrate\nthat these global invariances are still present one needs to find the Noether charges which generate\nthem. Noether charges (or generators) can be split into kinematical and dynamical generators. In\nthis paper we deal with free fields. At a quadratic level both kinematical and dynamical generators\nhave the following standard representation in terms of the physical light-cone field\nZ\n\u011c = dx\u2212 dd\u22122 xh\u2202 + \u03c6|G|\u03c6i .\n(2.2)\n4\n\nFor the case of totally symmetric tensor fields this simple fact can be checked in a rather straightforward way\n(see e.g.[4]). It is naturally to expect that light-cone matching of spin degrees of freedom is still to be case for the\ncase of mixed symmetry AdS massless fields (which are beyond scope of this paper) and corresponding conformal\nfundamental and shadow fields.\n5\nWe use parametrization of AdSd space in which ds2 = (\u2212dx20 + dx2i + dx2d\u22121 + dz 2 )/z 2 .

In Ref.[4] we have developed\nlight-cone formulation of totally symmetric conformal fundamental fields with canonical conformal dimension \u22060 and associated shadow fields starting with Lorentz covariant formulation. This\nFor the case of totally symmetric massive bosonic (fermionic) fields the |\u03c6s\u2032 i is irreducible spin |s\u2032 | (|s\u2032 | \u2212 21 )\ntensor (tensor-spinor) of the so(d \u2212 3) algebra. For mixed symmetry fields the |\u03c6s\u2032 i is reducible representation of the\nso(d \u2212 3) algebra in general.\n7\n\n5\n\n\fstrategy is difficult to realize in many cases because the Lorentz covariant formulations are not\navailable in general. One of attractive features of light-cone formalism is that it admits to formulate CFT without knowledge of Lorentz covariant formulation. The practice we have got while\nderiving light-cone formulation of totally symmetric conformal fundamental and shadow fields\nallows us to develop general light-cone formalism. In this section we construct light-cone form\nof the so(d \u2212 1, 2) conformal algebra generators for arbitrary conformal dimension \u2206 (1.1) and\narbitrary symmetry (totally symmetric and mixed symmetry) conformal fundamental and shadow\nfields. We show that these generators can be constructed in terms of the spin operators and the\nAdS mass operator which appear in light-cone gauge formulation of field dynamics in AdS space.\nWe start with discussion of bosonic fields.\nTo develop general light-cone we should make an assumption about generators. Based on\nour previous study of totally symmetric conformal fundamental and shadow fields (see Appendix\nC of Ref.[4]) we make the following two assumptions about structure of the conformal algebra\ngenerators acting on conformal fundamental and shadow fields8 .\n(i) Taking into account the form of the generators P a , J ab , D found for the case of totally\nsymmetric representations we suppose that they maintain this form for arbitrary representations\nP a = \u2202a ,\n\n(3.1)\n\nJ +i = l+i ,\n\n(3.2)\n\nJ +\u2212 = l+\u2212 ,\n\n(3.3)\n\nJ ij = lij + M ij ,\n\n(3.4)\n\nJ \u2212i = l\u2212i + M \u2212i ,\n\n(3.5)\n\nD = xa \u2202a +\n\nd\u22122\n,\n2\n\n(3.6)\n\nwhere we use the notation9\nlab \u2261 xa \u2202 b \u2212 xb \u2202 a ,\n\n(3.7)\n\n1\nK0a \u2261 \u2212 x2 \u2202 a + xa xb \u2202b ,\n2\nq\n\u2202j\nM \u2212i \u2261 M ij + + + M i ,\n\u2202\n\u2202\np\nq \u2261 \u2202a \u2202 a ,\nx2 \u2261 xa xa .\n\n(3.8)\n(3.9)\n(3.10)\n\nM ij and M i are the spin operators, i.e. they are acting only on the spin degrees of freedom of CFT\nfields.

In Appendix A by exploiting only\nthe commutation relations of the conformal algebra so(d \u2212 1, 2) we demonstrate that the above\nassumptions turn out to be sufficient to find the remaining generators and to get closed defining\nequations for the operator A.

We note also that on CFT and AdS sides these operators are realized\non fields having the same number of spin D.o.F. Because of the representation for CFT generators\n\u2032 \u2032\n\nIn this section the 'transverse' indices I = {0\u2032 , i}, J = {0\u2032 , j} are contracted by using flat metric \u03b7 IJ : \u03b7 0 0 = \u22121,\n\u03b7 ij = \u03b4 ij . This is to say that expression M 2 = M IJ M IJ takes the form M 2 = M ij M ij \u2212 2M i M i , i.e. we use the\n\u2032\nidentification M 0 i \u2261 M i .\n11\nSome differences in signs in Eqs.(2.15)-(2.18) and Eqs.(3.16)-(3.18) are related with the fact we use anti-hermitian\nspin operator M zi (2.14) on AdS side and hermitian M i (3.12) on CFT side.\n10\n\n7\n\n\fgiven in (3.1)-(3.15) is formulated in terms of the spin operators A, B, M IJ which appear in lightcone gauge formulation of field dynamics in AdS space we refer to this representation for CFT\ngenerators as AdS friendly form of CFT12 .\nLet us denote CFT field on which AdS friendly representation is realized as |OAdS i. Generators\nacting on |OAdS i (see (3.5),(3.13)-(3.15)) are non-polynomial with respect to the derivatives in\ntransverse and minus light-cone directions, \u2202 i , \u2202 \u221213 . However, these non-polynomial terms can\nbe cancelled by passing from basis of |OAdS i to the bases of conformal fundamental fields and\ne respectively. We demonstrate cancellation of\nshadow fields which we shall denote by |Oi and |Oi\ne for the simplest case of generator K + . To this end\nnon-polynomial terms in bases of |Oi and |Oi\nwe note that the AdS mass operator A being hermitian can be diagonalized on the whole space of\n|OAdS i. Being diagonalized this operator can be presented in the form given in (2.20).

Intertwining operator realization of AdS/CFT correspondence was investigated in [31]. For\nreview and complete list of references see [32]. In this Section we study AdS/CFT correspondence\nfor both the Lorentzian and Euclidean signatures.\n12\n\nThe relations (2.3)-(2.12) and (3.1)-(3.15) are applicable to the bosonic fields. Extension to the fermionic fields is\nto make replacement x\u2212 \u2192 x\u2212 + 2\u22021+ in these relations\n13\nNon-polynomial terms wit respect to light-cone derivative \u2202 + are unavoidable in light-cone formulation.\n\n8\n\n\fLorentzian signature. We begin with study of correspondence for AdS space of Lorentzian\nsignature. Discussion of this correspondence for the scalar field may be found in [33] and for\ntotally symmetric arbitrary spin massless fields in [4].\nWe demonstrate that boundary value of normalizable solution of bulk equations of motion is\nrelated to the conformal fundamental field |Oi, while that of non-normalizable solution is related\ne (see [33, 4]). To this end we consider light-cone equations of motion which\nto the shadow field |Oi\ntake the form\n\u0010\n1\n1 \u0011\n\u2212\u2202z2 + 2 (\u03ba2 \u2212 ) |\u03c6i = q 2 |\u03c6i ,\nz\n4\nand obtain the following normalizable and non-normalizable solutions\n|\u03c6norm (x, z)i = Z\u03ba (qz)|OAdS (x)i ,\n\n(4.1)\n\n(4.2)\n\n|\u03c6non\u2212norm (x, z)i = Z\u2212\u03ba (qz)|OAdS (x)i ,\n(4.3)\n\u221a\nwhere we use the notation Z\u03ba (z) \u2261 zJ\u03ba (z) and J\u03ba is Bessel function14. In (4.2) we use the\nnotation for the boundary field |OAdS i since we are going to demonstrate that this field is indeed\na carrier of AdS friendly representation discussed above. This is to say that AdS transformations\nfor bulk field |\u03c6i lead to conformal theory transformations for boundary field |OAdS i\nGAdS |\u03c6norm (x, z)i = Z\u03ba (qz)GCF T |OAdS (x)i .\n\n(4.4)\n\nHere and below we use the notation GAdS and GCF T to indicate the realization of the so(d \u2212 1, 2)\nalgebra generators on the bulk field |\u03c6i (2.3)-(2.12) and conformal theory field |OAdS i (3.1)-(3.15)\nrespectively. Let us demonstrate the matching (4.4) for the generator K + . To this end we use the\nfollowing general relation\n(K0a\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\nz2 a\n\u2202a 2 1\na\na\na\n\u2212 \u2202 + x (y + z\u2202z ))Z\u03ba (qz) = Z\u03ba (qz) K0 \u2212 2 (\u03ba \u2212 ) + x (y + z\u2202z )\n2\n2q\n4\nd\u22122\n\u2202a\n(\u2202q Z\u03ba (qz))(\n\u2212 y \u2212 z\u2202z )\n+\nq\n2\n\n(4.5)\n\nwhere K0a is given in (3.8). Adopting relation (4.5) for y = d\u22122\n, a = +, and using expressions for\n2\n+\n+\nKAdS (2.8), KCF T (3.13), and taking into account that |OAdS i in (4.2) does not depend z we get\n+\n+\nimmediately that KAdS\nand KCF\nsatisfy the relation (4.4)15 .\nT\nTaking into account relations (3.19) and (4.2),(4.3) we make sure that for small z one has the\nlocal interrelations\n1\n\n|\u03c6norm (x, z)i \u223c z \u03ba+ 2 |O(x)i ,\n\n1\ne\n|\u03c6non\u2212norm (x, z)i \u223c z \u2212\u03ba+ 2 |O(x)i\n.\n\n(4.6)\n\ne that is the boundary value of\ni.e. it is the conformal fundamental field |Oi (and shadow field |Oi)\n|\u03c6norm i (and |\u03c6non\u2212normi) as it should be. Relations (4.4),(4.6) explain desired AdS/CFT correspondence in Lorentzian signature.\n14\n\nTo keep discussion from becoming unwieldy here we restrict our attention to non-integer \u03ba. In this case the\nsolutions given in (4.2),(4.3) are independent.\n15\nFor the case of the generators P a , J +i , J +\u2212 , J ij , D matching (4.4) is obvious. This matching for the generators\n\u2212i\nJ , K i , K \u2212 can be proved following procedure explored in Section 7 of Ref.[4].\n\n9\n\n\fEuclidean signature. Now we demonstrate AdS/CFT correspondence in the Euclidean signature at the level of two point function16 . In light-cone gauge the arbitrary spin massive and massless\nfields in AdSd are described by respective so(d \u2212 1) and so(d \u2212 2) tensor fields.

The results presented here should have a number of interesting applications and\ngeneralizations, some of which are:\ni) In this paper we develop light-cone formulation for conformal fundamental fields and shadow\nfields. As is well known shadow fields can be used to formulate conformal invariant equations\nof motion. It would be interesting to apply light-cone approach to study of conformal invariant\nequations of motion for mixed symmetry conformal fields.\nii) The light-cone formulation we develop in this paper allows us to study of bosonic and\nfermionic conformal fundamental (and shadow) fields on an equal footing. It would be interesting\nto apply our approach to study of supersymmetric multiplets of superconformal algebra psu(2, 2|4)\nwhich are relevant in the study of AdS/CFT correspondence.\nAcknowledgments.

Euclidean version of the AdS/CFT correspondence for arbitrary spin massless fields\nwas studied in [20] (see also [36]).\n17\nNote that only in the remainder of this paper we use the Euclidean signature. For d = 4 the AdS mass operator is\nequal to zero for all massless fields. Here we restrict our attention to the dimensions d \u2265 5.\n\n10\n\n\fAppendix A\n\nDerivation of generators K i , K \u2212 .\n\nIn this appendix we outline procedure of derivation of representation for generators K i , K \u2212 given\nin (3.14),(3.15) and prove that the operators A, B and the spin operators M ij , M i should satisfy\nthe following equations\n[A, M ij ] = 0 ,\n\n(A.1)\n\n2{M i , A} \u2212 [[M i , A], A] = 0 ,\n\n(A.2)\n\n[M i , [M j , A]] \u2212 {M il , M lj } \u2212 {M i , M j } = 2\u03b4 ij B .\n\n(A.3)\n\nWe proceed in the following way.\ni) We note that the commutation relations of K + with the generators given in (3.1)-(3.6) imply that the operator A is independent of space-time coordinates xa and their derivatives \u2202 a and\ncommutes with spin operator M ij , i.e. we obtain (A.1).\nii) From commutator\n[K + , J \u2212i ] = K i\n(A.4)\nwe find representation for K i given in (3.14).\niii) Using expressions for K + (3.13) and K i (3.14) we evaluate the commutator\n\u2202+\n[K , K ] = 3 (\u22122{M i , A} + [[M i , A], A]) .\n4q\n+\n\ni\n\n(A.5)\n\nFrom this relation and the commutator [K + , K i ] = 0 we obtain the constraint (A.2).\niv) Making use of (3.5) and (3.14) we evaluate then the commutator\n[J \u2212i , K j ]\n\u0011\n\u0010\n1\n\u2202l\nd \u2212 2 \u2212 \u2202\u2212\nl\nx \u2212 2 A + + (M kl xk \u2202 l + M l xl q) \u2212\n[M\n,\nA]\n= \u03b4 ij K0\u2212 +\n2\n2q\n\u2202\n2q\u2202 +\n\u0011\n1 \u0010\n+ + [M i , [M j , A]] \u2212 {M il , M lj } \u2212 {M i , M j } .\n2\u2202\n\n(A.6)\n\nFrom this and the so(d \u2212 1, 2) algebra commutator [J \u2212i , K j ] = \u03b4 ij K \u2212 we find the representation\nfor the generator K \u2212 given in (3.15) provided the spin operators M ij , the operators A and B satisfy\nthe constraint given in (A.3). Note that this constraint gives definition of operator B in terms of\nbasic operators which are spin operator M ij and AdS mass operator A.\nThus we obtain representation for generators K i , K \u2212 given in (3.14),(3.15) and equations\n(A.1)-(A.3). All that remains is to prove that equations (A.1)-(A.3) are equivalent to representation\nfor operators A and B and basic defining equations given in (3.16)-(3.18). This can be done by\nfollowing a procedure explored in the Appendix A of Ref.[16].\n\n11\n\n\fReferences\n[1] J. M. Maldacena, Adv. Theor. Math. Phys. 2, 231 (1998) [Int. J. Theor.
