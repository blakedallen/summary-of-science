The occurrence of a surfactant-like stage, in which a single layer of Ag covers the\nFe film is demonstrated for films of 4-6 ML heated at 500-550 K. Evidence of a stage characterized\nby the formation of two Ag capping layers is also reported. As the annealing temperature was\nincreased beyond 700 K the surface layers closely resembled the structure of bare Ag(001) with the\nresidual presence of subsurface Fe aggregates. The data illustrate a film dissolution path which is\nin agreement with recent theoretical models [J. Roussel et al. Phys. Rev. B 60, 13890 (1999)].\nPACS numbers: 68.35.-p, 68.55.-a\n\nThe phase immiscibility and the excellent matching between Ag(001) and Fe(001) unit cells (mismatch 0.8 %)\nmake Fe/Ag growth attractive in the field of low dimensionality magnetic systems, such as ultrathin films,1\nmultilayers,2 and small aggregates3. At the nanometric scale, atomic exchange processes were found to affect the chemical sharpness of interfaces in films and\nmultilayers.4 Intermixing could be drastically limited at\ndeposition temperatures as low as 140-150 K4,5,6 at the\nexpense of a poor morphological quality of the film.7,8\nThe film structural evolution induced by post-growth annealing presents many interesting aspects involving activated atomic exchange processes and affecting magnetic\nproperties.9 Previous experiments, of He and low energy\nion scattering on films deposited at 150 K, indicated the\nformation of a segregated Ag layer upon moderate annealing (550 K). Higher temperatures led to the embedding of Fe into the Ag matrix.10 In those experiments,\ninformation on sub-surface layers was attained by ion\nerosion depth profiling, a destructive technique mainly\nsensitive to the topmost layer. Many questions remained\nopen about the film structure and morphology evolution\nduring dissolution. Here we address this issue by presenting photoelectron and x-ray diffraction experiments, performed at the ALOISA beam line (ELETTRA, Trieste).\nPED provides chemically selected data on film structure\nwith an information depth of several layers. It allows\nto characterize local order in films which are disordered\non a long range scale and possesses specific sensitivity to\nsegregation processes.11 Systematic PED measurements\nhave been accompanied with a few XRD rod scans yielding a better sensitivity to the buried interface and the\nfilm long range order. The results of this paper allow\na comparison with recent models enlightening the dissolution paths of an ultra thin metal film into a different\nmetal, when both subsurface migration of the deposit\nand phase separation between substrate and deposit are\nfavoured.17,18\n\nDetails on the ALOISA system can be found\nelsewhere.12 The Ag substrate was prepared according\nto well established procedures.7 Reflection High Energy\nElectron Diffraction was used to monitor the surface order. XPS surveys were employed to check the chemical\ncomposition of the surface. Grazing incidence XPS was\nalso used to monitor in real time Fe 2p and Ag 3p signals\nduring annealing ramps. The sample temperature was\ncontrolled by thermocouples and by an optical pyrometer. Guided by results of refs.4,10 , heating was stopped at\nprogressively higher temperatures, then cooling the system and looking at film structure. Iron was evaporated\nby electron bombardment, controlling the deposition flux\n(\u223c 1.5 \u00c5/min) by a quartz microbalance. Measurements\nwere focused on films in the 4-10 ML thickness range\ndeposited at 150 K. Grazing incidence XRD have been\napplied on a few films by measuring radial scans across\nthe (200) and (220) peaks in the in\u2013plane Ag(001) reciprocal lattice. These measurements yielded the lateral\nlattice spacing with a precision better than 0.01 \u00c5. The\nvertical structure of the Fe film has been also probed by\nout-of-plane XRD (rod scan), taken for the (20L) rod at\na photon energy of 6000 eV. PED polar scans were measured at grazing incidence (h\u03bd = 900-1300 eV) in Transverse Magnetic polarization, by rotating an electron energy analyzer in the scattering plane. The notation Ag\n(Fe) nl(\u03b8), will indicate PED scans as a function of the\npolar angle \u03b8 from the surface normal, obtained by photoemission from nl states of Ag (Fe). The photoemission\nintensity was collected at the peak energy and at suitably\nchosen energies along the peak tails in order to allow for\na subtraction of the background due to secondary electrons. FF will denote forward focusing peaks along off\nnormal nearest neighbour atomic chains. For the sake of\nsynthesis we will show only data taken with the h001i Ag\nsurface direction in the scattering plane.\nThe computational approach to PED was thoroughly described elsewhere.13 In brief, the polar\n\n\f2\n\nXPS intensity (a.u.)\n\n20x1012\n\nPED, 6 ML,\ndeposited at 150 K\n\n15\n\nFe 2p\nAg 3p\n\n10\n5\n0\n\nPED, 6 ML,\nannealed to 550 K\n\n12x1012\nXPS Intensity (a.u.)\n\nscans Iexp (\u03b8) have been compared with calculated\nIcalc (\u03b8) = ISOcalc (\u03b8) (1 + \u03c7calc )(\u03b8). The anisotropy\nterm \u03c7calc (\u03b8), carrying information on the arrangement\nof atoms around the photo-emitter, was taken proportional to the output generated by the Multiple Scattering Calculation of Diffraction (MSCD) package.14 Several\nstructural models have been considered both for the asdeposited and the annealed films. We varied the number\nof Fe planes and considered the presence of one or more\nAg layers over the Fe film; intermixed interfaces were\nalso examined. In all calculations, the in-plane lattice\nconstants of the film aF e was set to the substrate value\naAg = 2.88 \u00c5, inferred from in-plane grazing incidence\nXRD, which indicated a pseudomorphic in-plane structure, independently on the investigated thickness and annealing temperature. In fact, the formation of a non\npseudomorphic Fe film would have yielded side-peaks or\nshoulders close to the substrate in-plane XRD peaks,15\nwhich were never observed. The isotropic term ISOcalc (\u03b8)\nhas been calculated, taking into account emission matrix\nelements, electron escape path, surface roughness and instrumental factors.13 Regarding as-deposited films, systematic PED (and Auger electron diffraction) measurements, taken along several azimuthal orientations, indicated growth of Fe films with body centered cubic structure and unit cell rotated by 45\u25e6 with respect to the\nsubstrate cell (in brief R45 bcc structure). The body of\ndata resulted in close agreement with literature.4,16 For\nfilms thicker than 5 ML the ratio between the vertical\nand in-plane lattice constants cF e /aF e matched unity, as\nexpected for an ideal bcc structure. On the thinnest films\nthe FF peak was slightly shifted from the bcc position,\ngiving a value cF e /aF e = 1.06 \u00b1 0.01 for a 4 ML film.\nThis expansion of cF e , was early attributed to the influence of intermixing at the interface4,7 . Representative\nmeasurements on a 6 ML film are reported in the upper\npanel of Fig. 1.\nIn the figure, the calculations are related to a model\nwith 6 layers of Fe (R45 bcc structure) laying on the substrate mimicked by 3 layers of Ag (in brief 6Fe/Sub).\nConcerning the Fe pattern, the simulation was insensitive to the value of the interlayer distance at the intere\nface (dF\nAg ). The best simulation of the Ag 3p (\u03b8) pattern,\nshowing a strong attenuation of intensity and significant\nshape variations with respect to the bare Ag(001), was\ne\nobtained with dF\nAg = 1.70 \u00b1 0.03 \u00c5. This value, in between Ag (dAg \u223c 2.04 \u00c5) and Fe (dF e \u223c 1.43 \u00c5) bulk\ninterlayer spacings, enabled reproduction of the main features of the pattern, including the suppression of the FF\npeak typical of fcc structure, at 45\u25e6 .\nFe 2p (\u03b8) and Ag 3p (\u03b8) patterns obtained on the same\n6 \u00b10.5 ML Fe film after annealing at 550 K are shown in\nthe lower panel of Fig. 1. The shape of the Fe PED pattern was similar to the as-deposited one. The Ag 3p (\u03b8)\ndata, showing a quasi isotropic behaviour suggested the\nsimple physical model of a Ag overlayer. Continuous lines\nin the figure were calculated according to a 1Ag/6Fe/Sub\nscheme. The structure of the Fe film was the same used\n\nFe 2p\nAg 3p\n\n8\n4\n0\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\nPolar angle (deg)\nFIG. 1: Fe 2p (\u03b8) and Ag 3p (\u03b8) PED patterns obtained on a\n6\u00b10.5 ML Fe film (upper panel) deposited at 150 K and (lower\npanel) after annealing at 550 K. Measurements were taken at\n150 K along the h100i azimuth of the Ag substrate. In both\npanels continuous and dashed lines represent the calculated\nIcalc (\u03b8) and ISOcalc patterns, respectively.\n\nfor the as-deposited film. The two Fe/Ag interfaces were\nassumed sharp. The Fe/Ag distance at the top layer resulted dAg\nF e = 1.70 \u00b1 0.03 \u00c5. The simulations reproduce\nrather accurately both Fe and Ag PED patterns supporting quantitatively the assumed structural model.\nOut-of-plane XRD measurements taken on a 5 \u00b10.5\nML Fe film are consistent with the model drawn from\nPED. The XRD scans along the (20L) rod are shown in\nFig. 2, as taken for the just deposited (150 K) film and\nafter annealing at 500 K and 750 K. The absence of regular features in the pristine film was attributed to the\nlack of long range order and to the large surface roughness. After annealing to 500 K, well defined modulations\nappeared, which witnessed the formation of large Fe domains and sharp interfaces. Fitting to the rod scan of the\nannealed film yielded a model with 4.5 Fe layers covered\nby one surfactant Ag layer. Due to the reduced region of\nreciprocal space presently explored, we have reduced the\nfitting parameters by considering a simple model where\nthe three inner Fe layers were fixed to the bulk spacing. In fact, the rod modulations are mainly sensitive\nto the film interfaces, where we focussed our fitting optimization. We found an height of 1.6 and 1.8 \u00c5 for the\nAg surfactant layer above the 4th and 5th Fe layer, respectively. This discrepancy is simply due to the model\nsimplification, which does not allow the 4th Fe layer to\nrelax (see inset of Fig. 2). The width of the buried FeAg interface was found to be 1.6 \u00c5.

Fe 2p (\u03b8) continued to show bcc-like structure,\nbut with an increased anisotropy along the normal direction. The Ag 3p (\u03b8) data show faint features at 0\u25e6 , \u223c 10\u25e6 ,\n\u223c 20\u25e6 and a huge peak at 44\u25e6 , indicating the formation\nof two Ag surfactant layers. Addition of a second Ag surface layer together with optimization of the dAg\nF e distance\ndistance\nbetween\nthe first\nat the interface and of the dAg\nAg\nand second Ag layer, yielded a satisfactory simulation of\nthe Ag PED pattern. The Icalc curves, superimposed to\nthe data of Fig. 3, were calculated considering a 2Ag/7Fe\nAg\nmodel with dAg\nF e = 1.73 \u00b10.03 \u00c5 and dAg = 1.90 \u00b10.03 \u00c5.\ne\ndF\nF e was set at 1.43 \u00c5. The simulation of the Fe 2p data\nwas less satisfactory suggesting that the model oversimplifies the physical situation, where the second Ag layer\ncould be only partially filled.\nUpon further increasing the annealing temperature,\nthe Ag 3p PED patterns gradually approached the one\nobtained on bare Ag(001).

Representative data obtained on the 6 \u00b10.5 ML film after annealing at 800 K\nare shown in the lower panel of Fig. 3. The Ag pattern\nwas reproduced considering the same structural model\nused to fit the PED taken on the clean substrate (not\nshown). On the other hand models with Fe layers buried\nunder many Ag layers, could not fit Fe 2p patterns at\nall. The overall intensity of the Fe 2p pattern presented\na relevant attenuation with respect to the as-deposited\nfilm. However, a significant anisotropy is still appreciable. These findings suggested the presence of subsurface\nFe aggregates of small lateral size. Similar effects were\nalso observed from XRD, where the rod scan taken after\nannealing to 750 K (filled triangles in Fig. 2) yielded a\nsmooth decay due to the disappearance of the subsurface\nFe film. This rod scan is indicative of either Fe dissolution in the Ag matrix either fragmentation of the Fe\nfilm into small clusters of irregular size and spatial distribution. In order to get more information on such aggregates from PED data, we explored simple N Ag/M Fe\nstructural models in which M layers of Fe (for simplicity with bcc structure) were buried below N layers of Ag\n(with interlayer distance dAg\nAg ). A sharp Fe/Ag interface\n\n\f4\nwas considered with interface spacing dAg\nF e . In the case\nM = 6, i.e. assuming for aggregates the same nominal\nthickness of the as-deposited film, a qualitative agreement (not shown) could be obtained with N = 1 or 2.\nThe agreement became definitely worse with larger values of N . A fair reproduction of the pattern (including\nthe twinned PED feature at about 45\u25e6 and 55\u25e6 ) could\nbe finally obtained with a 2Ag/8Fe model, dAg\nAg = 1.87\nAg\n\u00b1 0.03 \u00c5, dF e = 1.67 \u00b1 0.03 \u00c5 (full lines in Fig. 3).\nThus, although the shape and size of the Fe subsurface\naggregates could not be determined, the analysis of PED\npattern confirms, on a quantitative ground, the residual\npresence of subsurface Fe clusters.\nOur data can be rationalized in the light of recent\ntheories on dissolution of ultra thin metal film into a\nmetal substrate which enlightened different routes depending on the physico-chemical coupling of the deposit\n(A) and substrate (B)17,18 . When A and B present a tendency to bulk ordering, the dissolution can be blocked\nby the formation of AB surface alloys. In case of tendency to A/B phase separation, dissolution paths will\ncritically depend on the A and B surface energies. The\ncase of interest here, in which B atoms show a stronger\ntendency to surface segregation than A atoms as for\nFe/Ag or Ni/Ag systems,19 was illustrated in Ref.18 on\nthe example of a 10 ML deposit (schematically indicated as A/A/. . ./A/B). According to calculations, if\nthe temperature is raised beyond a threshold TC , dissolution proceeds through the so called surfactant-layerby-layer (SLBLD) mode. In this regime, on a short\nrange time scale, the system passes through a surfactant\nlike stage, with formation of successive B/A/A/. . ./A/B,\nB/B/A/A/. . ./A/B and B/B/B/A/A/. . ./A/B profiles.\n\n\u2217\n\n\u2020\n\u2021\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n\nAlso at Physics Department, University of Ljubljana,\nSlovenia.\nAlso at Physics Department, University of Trieste, Italy.\nElectronic address: Canepa@fisica.unige.it\nW.F.

Lett. 70,\n\nThe excellent agreement between data of figs. 1 and\n2 with a 1Ag/Fe/Fe/. . ./Fe/Sub model nicely demonstrates the occurrence of the B/A/A/../A/B stage. Note\nthat the MSCD simulations provide a reliable indication\nthat the local structure of the Fe film remains substantially intact, in agreement with the model which predicts\na negligible loss of deposit matter into the bulk at this\nstage.18 In addition, XRD rod scans indicate that the\nformation of the first Ag surfactant layer does not involve a fragmentation of the Fe film. Rather the film\nis ordered to a uniform thickness in the early annealing stage and this order is preserved during the segregation of the first surfactant layer. Data of Fig. 3 (upper\npanel), representing a physical situation mimicking the\nB/B/A/. . ./A/B stage, add further confidence about the\nagreement of our results with the model. On the basis\nof these results, we feel encouraged to extend the conclusions about the surfactant stage to the larger spatial\nscale probed by He diffraction in previous experiments\nperformed under similar experimental conditions.10 Data\nof Fig. 3 (lower panel) illustrate a clear trend towards film\ndissolution, which appears in qualitative agreement with\nthe final stage predicted by theory, i.e. total disappearance of deposit species down to the tenth substrate layer,\nfor T > TC . Residual Fe clusters in the PED data for\nthe highest annealing temperature is the only deviation\nof our data from the SLBLD model, possibly due to specific details of the present system surface energies or to\nexperimental limitations. For example, Oxygen impurities tend to locally lower the surface energy of the film,\ntherefore acting as surfactant species20 competing with\nAg.\n\n10\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n1006 (1993); D.M.
