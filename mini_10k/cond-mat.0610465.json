In this letter, we now demonstrate its accuracy and efficiency for the determination of\nthe magnetic excitation spectrum. For that purpose, we calculate the spin excitations of the widely\nstudied diluted III-V magnetic semiconductor Ga1\u2212x Mnx As. Instead of the expected broadening of\nthe excitations due to disorder, it is shown that magnons exist only in a very restricted region of the\nBrillouin zone. We calculate without adjusting parameters, the spin stiffness in optimally annealed\nsystems as a function of x and compare it to recent measurements. We find a very good agreement\nfor well annealed samples and provide a plausible explanation for the very small values measured in\nas grown ones. We hope that this study will stimulate new studies as Ineslatic Neutron Scattering\nmeasurements for example.\n\nThe understanding of the influence and effects of disorder on transport and magnetic properties in magnetic\nmaterials is a key issue from both a fundamental point\nof view or in the prospect of possible technological applications. This requires the necessity to develop new\nmethods and tools which are able to treat the disorder\nin a reliable manner. The word disorder is very general and includes for example,(i) the dilution of magnetic\natoms in a non magnetic matrix, (ii) substitution of a\nnon magnetic atom by another one which has a different\nradius or/and valency as in manganites A1\u2212x Bx MnO3\nwhere A=La,Pr and B=Sr,Ca,Ba for example, (iii) intrinsic defects which may appear during the growth of\nthe material, for instance vacancies in \"d0 \" compound\nas ZrO2 , HfO2 or TiO2 . By browsing the literature, one\ncan find several examples which underline the importance\nand crucial role of the disorder. For example, in manganites one can observe after substitution, metal-insulator\nphase transition, formation of nanoscale inhomogeneities,\nor anomalies in the magnetic excitation spectrum, see for\nexample [1, 2, 3, 4]. We can also mention the high Curie\ntemperature reported in materials which, a priori, do not\ncontain any or at least a sufficient amount of magnetic\nimpurities [5, 6]. The ferromagnetism is attributed to\ndefects which can in the case of HfO2 appear close to the\ninterface between the material and the substrate. Another example is the spin wave ferromagnetic excitation\nobserved after vacancies are introduced in the cobaltate\nNa1\u2212x \u2737x CoO2 [7] (the symbol \u2737 corresponds to vacancies), thus the substitution of Na by a vacancy is more\nthan just a way to vary the carrier concentration. In\n\n\u00b6 email:bouzerar@ill.fr\n\ndiluted magnetic semiconductors as GaMnAs it is seen\nthat the magnetic moment distribution and Curie temperature are also very sensitive to the sample history and\nthus to the presence of compensating defects as Mn interstitials and As anti-sites [8].\nIn this manuscript we focus our attention on the nature\nof the magnetic excitation spectrum in dilute ferromagnetic materials. We will show that the proper and simultaneous treatment of both disorder and thermal fluctuations leads to unusual excitation spectrum in comparison\nto what is usually observed in non dilute systems. The\npaper is organized as follows. In the first part, we present\na summary of the formalism based on the Self-Consistent\nLocal Random Phase Approximation theory (SC-LRPA).\nIn the second part, using the exchange couplings calculated within first principle approach (no adjustable parameters), we calculate the spectral function, excitation\nspectrum and spin stiffness as a function of the impurity\nconcentration in optimally annealed Ga1\u2212x Mnx As. The\nterm optimally annealed means that the concentration\nof compensating defects is negligible. In the last part\nwe compare our results to available experimental data\nfor the spin stiffness and explain the large difference observed between as grown and annealed samples.\nThe Hamiltonian which describes Nimp interacting\nquantum (or classical) spins randomly distributed on a\ngiven lattice of N sites is the dilute Heisenberg model,\nX\nJij Si * Sj\n(1)\nH=\u2212\ni,j\n\nThe couplings Jij are very general (short or long\nrange), they are assumed to be given and can eventuNimp\n.\nally depend on the impurity concentration x = N\nWe will come back to this point in what follows. For a\ngiven configuration of disorder e.g. the coordinates of the\n\n\f2\nmagnetic impurities, we\ndefine the retarded spin Green's\nR +\u221e\nfunction Gcij (\u03c9) = \u2212\u221e Gcij (t)ei\u03c9t dt where Gcij (t) =\n\u2212i\u03b8(t)h[Si+ (t), Sj\u2212 (0)]i which describes the transverse\nspin fluctuations, where the subscript \u2032\u2032 c\u2032\u2032 corresponds\nto the configuration index. After performing the Local\nRandom Phase Approximation decoupling of the higher\norder Green's functions which appear in the equation of\nmotion of Gcij (\u03c9) [9, 10], we find,\n(\u03c9I \u2212 Hceff )Gc = D\n\n(2)\n\nwhere Hceff , Gc and D are Nimp \u00d7 Nimp matrices. The\nindex i runs over only the sites occupied by a localized spin. The effective Hamiltonian\nmatrix elements is\nP\n(Hceff )ij = \u2212hSiz iJij + \u03b4ij l hSlz iJlj and Dij = 2hSiz i\u03b4ij .\nThe local magnetization hSiz i has to be calculated selfconsistently\nP atc each temperature. Note also that the condition\nj (Heff )ij = 0, implies that zero is eigenvalue\nof Hceff , the SC-LRPA treatment is consistent with the\nGoldstone theorem. Note that although the matrix is\nnon Hermitian, in the ferromagnetic phase the spectrum\nis real and positive at each temperature. If a negative\neigenvalue would appear, this would indicate an instability of the ferromagnetic phase, as in the case where\nfrustration would be present. In the following, we will\ndiscuss the case of GaMnAs for which all the couplings\nare ferromagnetic, thus such instabilities will not occur.\nBecause Hceff is non Hermitian (real non symetric), we\nnow precise how the GF is expressed. Hceff , has the property to be bi-orthogonal [14]. Thus, we define right and\nleft eigenvectors of Heff denoted respectively |\u03a8R,c\n\u03b1 i and\nc\n|\u03a8L,c\n\u03b1 i, both are associated to the same eigenvalues \u03c9\u03b1 :\nc\nR,c\nc\nR,c\nt c\nL,c\nc\nL,c\nHeff |\u03a8\u03b1 i = \u03c9\u03b1 |\u03a8\u03b1 i and Heff |\u03a8\u03b1 i = \u03c9\u03b1 |\u03a8\u03b1 i. In\ngeneral, two eigenvectors belonging to the same set L or\nR are not orthogonal to each other, but when they are of\nL,c\ndifferent type they fulfill the relation h\u03a8R,c\n\u03b1 |\u03a8\u03b1\u2032 i = \u03b4\u03b1,\u03b1\u2032 .\nAfter inserting the L,R eigenvectors in eq.(2), the retarded Green's function Gcij (\u03c9) can be rewritten,\nGcij (\u03c9) =\n\nX\n\u03b1\n\n2hSjz i\nL,c\nhi|\u03a8R,c\n\u03b1 ih\u03a8\u03b1 |ji\n\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9\u03b1c + i\u01eb\n\n(3)\n\nAlthough the system is non translation invariant\nwe define\nthe Fourier transform by \u1e20(q, \u03c9) =\nP iq(r\n1\ni \u2212rj )\ne\nGcij (\u03c9)ic . The notation h....ic deh Nimp\nij\nnotes the average over the disorder configurations. We\nnow define the dynamical spectral function\nP z \u0100(q, \u03c9) =\n\u22121\n1\nz\nIm\n\u1e20(q,\n\u03c9)\nwhere\nhhS\nii\n=\ni hSi i is the av\u03c0hhS z ii\nNimp\nerage magnetization over the impurity sites. The spectral\nfunction \u0100(q, \u03c9) is the physical quantity which provides\nthe direct access to the magnetic excitation spectrum, it\nis accessible by Inelastic Neutron Scattering experiment.\nIt reads,\nX\n\u0100(q, \u03c9) = h\nAc\u03b1 (q)\u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9\u03b1c )ic\n(4)\n\u03b1\n\nP\n1\nR,c\nL,c\niq(ri \u2212rj )\nwhere Ac\u03b1 (q) = Nimp\n,\nij \u03bbj hi|\u03a8\u03b1 ih\u03a8\u03b1 |jie\nwe have introduced temperature dependent local paramhS z i\neter \u03bbj = hhSjz ii . In the following we will calculate directly \u0100(q, \u03c9). However, It is also interesting to define\nthe moments associated to it,\nmn (q) =\n\nZ\n\n+\u221e\n\n\u03c9 n \u0100(q, \u03c9)d\u03c9\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n=h\n\n1\nNimp\n\nXX\nij\n\nL,c\niq(ri \u2212rj )\n(\u03c9\u03b1c )n \u03bbj hi|\u03a8R,c\nic (5)\n\u03b1 ih\u03a8\u03b1 |jie\n\n\u03b1\n\nWe now make some general remarks.\nIt is\nstraightforward to see that the first moment can\n \u0303\n \u0303\n \u0303\nbe rewritten Pm1 (q) = J(0)\n\u2212 J(q)\nwhere J(q)\n=\n1\niq(ri \u2212rj )\nz\nic . This expression is\nhhS ii h Nimp ij \u03bbj \u03bbi Jij e\ninteresting and shows that the magnon excitation spectrum depends on the renormalized temperature depeneff\ndent couplings by Jij\n(T ) = Jij \u03bbj \u03bbi . Since \u03bbi are fluctuating from site to site, the previous expression indicates that the excitation spectrum will have a more\ncomplex temperature dependence than that obtained in\nthe non dilute case (x = 1 and \u03bbi = 1) for which\nz\n\u03c9sw (T ) = hhSS ii \u03c9sw (T = 0). In the limit of q \u2192 0, we\nimmediately find that m1 (q) \u2248 D1 q 2 where the effective\nstiffness (in the following we will\nP clarify the use of \"effective\") is D1 = hhS z ii h 2 N1imp ij \u03bbj \u03bbi Jij (ri \u2212 rj )2 ic .\nNote that, at low temperature where all spins are polarized, this expression can be simplified and does not\ndepend on the nature of the eigenstates of the effective\nHamiltonian. If we assume that all couplings are ferromagnetic (as in GaMnAs) then we get,\nD1 (x) = xD1 (x = 1)\n\n(6)\n\nP\nwhere D1 = 2SN ij Jij (ri \u2212 rj )2 , where the double sum\nruns now over all sites. This expression indicates that the\nspin stiffness extracted from the first moment calculation\nreduces only to the virtual crystal expression. The consequence of this is the following. First D1 (x) overestimates\nthe real spin stiffness. Additionally, at sufficiently low\ndilution, one expects that below the percolation threshold both TC and the spin stiffness should vanish. This\nexpression is finite below the percolation threshold and\ndoes not know about it. Thus D1 does not correspond\nto the real spin stiffness. In the following we will explain\nhow to evaluate it properly.\nThe other\np interesting quantity is the effective linewidth\n\u03b3(q) = m2 (q) \u2212 m21 (q), it measures the broadening of\nthe magnetic excitations due to the disorder (dilution)\nand thermal fluctuations. In the long wave length limit,\nwe can show that \u03b3(q) = Cq. The linewidth is larger\nthan the excitation energy. Similar results were reported\nin the study of the disordered double exchange model\n(nearest neighbor coupling) relevant for manganite compounds (x = 1) [15].

In the inset,\nare plotted the first moment, the effective linewidth and the\nposition of the peak in A(q, \u03c9) as a function of qx /\u03c0(in units\nof a\u22121\n0 ) and the y-axis is in Kelvin.\n\nto conclude that there is no well defined magnetic excitations. As it will be seen in the following, even though the\nmagnon excitations are incoherent, they appear as well\ndefined peak in A(q, \u03c9). In other words, the energy and\nwidth of the excitations calculated with the moments of\nthe spectral function do not correspond to the peak position and linewidth of the excitations directly calculated\nwith the full spectral function.\nIn the following section and to illustrate our theory we\ncalculate the magnetic excitation spectrum in the III-V\ndilute magnetic semiconductor Ga1\u2212x Mnx As as a function of the Mn2+ concentration and at T = 0 K. In\nthis case, \u03bbi = 1, the matrix Heff is real symetric and\nthus L and R eigenvectors are identical. We present a\ndetailed analysis of the excitation spectrum as a function of the M n2+ concentration. In addition, in order\nto allow a quantitative study with no fitting parameters\nand a direct comparison with the experimental measurements, the magnetic exchange coupling we use were calculated from first principle Tight Binding Linear Muffin\nTin Orbital approach. The same couplings were used successfully for example in ref.[9, 10] to calculate the Curie\ntemperature. We stress that the used exchange couplings\nextend over 62 shells.\nIn Fig.1 we have plotted \u0100(q, \u03c9) for Ga1\u2212x Mnx As as\na function of energy for different values of the momentum q in the (1,0,0) direction. We remind that GaAs\nhas a zinc blend structure, thus the magnetic impurities\nare distributed randomly on the fcc sublattice of Ga. In\naddition, periodic boundary conditions have been used.\nThe calculations were performed on a system which contains 4 \u00d7 (32)3 sites, the average over disorder was performed over 50 configurations. Note that for x = 0.03\nthe system contains approximately Nimp = 4000 impu-\n\nrities. In all cases, we have checked that the number of\ndisorder configurations was sufficient to provide accurate\nresults.Indeed, for example for the 4\u00d7(16)3 system, it was\nfound that the average over 50 configurations is already\nsufficient. Even if we increase the number of configurations \u0100(q, \u03c9) remains almost unaffected.\nIn Fig.1 we can observe well defined excitations for only\nrelatively small values of the momentum. As the momentum q increases the peak becomes broader and the\nwell defined excitation is then replaced by a very broad\nstructure. In the inset we have plotted the first moment\nm1 (q), the linewidth \u03b3(q) and the position of the peak\nwhich we denote as \u03c9(q) as a function of the momentum\nq. It is clearly seen that at low q both m1 (q) \u2248 D1 q 2\nand \u03c9(q) \u2248 Dq 2 . However the \"effective stiffness\" D1\nappears to be larger than D, typically in this case we\nfind D1 /D \u2248 2. This is in agreement with the previous discussion that D1 overestimates the real spin stiffness, especially as we approach the regime of percolation. The main consequence of this is that the accurate\ndetermination of the spin stiffness should be done by directly plotting the energy of the peak as a function of\nthe momentum instead of using the first moment dispersion. As mentioned in the previous section we indeed\nobserve that the effective linewidth \u03b3(q) is linear in q,\nbut it does not correspond to the real linewidth of the\npeak observed in \u0100(q, \u03c9). The second moment is inappropriate to evaluate the real linewidth of the magnetic\nexcitation, this is reflected by the fact that the peak observed in Fig.1 are non Gaussian-like and very asymmetric. In fact, asymmetric peaks in the magnetic excitation\nspectrum were observed in the diluted antiferromagnet\nMnx Zn1\u2212x F2 [11]. It was observed that as we approach\nthe percolation threshold xc = 0.25 the line shape of the\nlow magnetic excitation peaks becomes strongly asymmetric and develops a long tail extending towards higher\nenergy. This is clearly seen in Fig.1. It was shown that\nthe peaks can be fitted by a two component structure:\na sharp Gaussian peak which describe the magnon excitation (its energy is q-dependent) and a broad localized\nmode (weakly q dependent). The observed increase of\nasymmetry of the peak as we increase the momentum\ncorresponds to a cross over from propagating low energy\nexcitations to localized excitations (fractons) [12, 13].\nIn the next figure, Fig.2, we have plotted the spectral\nfunction in (q, \u03c9) plane. As in the previous figure the\ndensity of magnetic impurity is x = 0.03. In contrast to\nwhat is usually observed in weakly disordered magnetic\nsystems as in manganites well defined excitations exist in\nthe dilute case only in a restricted region of the Brillouin\nzone centered around the \u0393 point (q = (0, 0, 0)). This\nunusual feature shows that the nature of ferromagnetism\nin the diluted semiconductors is very different from that\nobserved in non dilute materials. As seen in the previous\nfigure the broadening of the excitation increases significantly as we move away from the \u0393 point.

In Fig.4, we have\nplotted the spin stiffness D(x) and the Curie temperature\n(from ref.[10]) as a function of the M n2+ concentration\nx. We remind that there is no adjustable parameters in\nthese calculations. We observe that the values of D(x)\nare relatively high for dilute ferromagnetic system. For\nexample for x = 0.03 for which the Curie temperature is\nTC \u2248 80 K the spin stiffness is D \u2248 210 meV \u00c52 . Interestingly this value is close to what is usually measured in\nnon dilute systems as in manganites [16, 17, 18]. When\napproaching the percolation threshold from above the\nspin stiffness decreases very fastly, faster than the Curie\ntemperature which can be fitted by TC \u2248 A(x \u2212 xc )1/2\n[10]. However we can not extract the critical power in\na reliable manner, this should require more calculations\nclose to the percolation threshold. In the inset we have\nalso plotted the ratio Tc /D, it is clearly seen that the\nCurie temperature is not proportional to the spin stiffness.\nIt is now interesting to compare these results to experimental data. In contrast to Curie temperature or\nresistivity measurements, there are only few experimental studies concerning the magnetic excitation in diluted\nmagnetic semiconductors. In our knowledge there are\ntwo papers in which the measurement of the spin stiffness\nin GaMnAs was done. In ref.[19], the authors have measured it by ferromagnetic resonance in as grown sample\nwhere x = 0.05. They have reported a value of approximately 60 meV \u00c52 . In a recent study [20], done using\nsamples of different concentrations and sample history,\nit was shown that annealed sample possess much higher\nvalues of the spin stiffness. Indeed, it was shown that the\nannealed sample (x = 0.03) which orders ferromagnetically below TCexp = 80K has a spin stiffness of the order\n\n\f5\nof Dexp \u2248 160 meV \u00c52 , whilst for as grown samples (x =\n0.05 and 0.06) Dexp was only approximately 40 meV \u00c52 .\nWe remind that our calculation are performed for optimally annealed samples. In Fig.4 for x = 0.03 we find\nTCth = 88 K and Dth (x = 0.03) = 210 meV \u00c52 , both of\nthese values agrees well with the experimental values.\nBecause the concentration of Mn is not precisely known\nin experimental samples, a value of x = 2.5% would lead\nto TCth = 75K and Dth (x = 0.025) = 175 meV \u00c52 , this\nwould significantly improve the agreement. Now the interesting question is: Why are the values of the spin stiffness is as grown sample so small? Let us assume that\nbefore annealing the main effect of compensation (for\nmore details see ref.[10]) is a reduction of the density of\nthe magnetically active Mn (xeff ). Because the measured\nTC \u2248 65 \u2212 80 K for x \u2248 5% \u2212 6% , from the theoretical\ncurve of TC we would conclude that xeff \u2265 2.5%. Thus\nthe expected stiffness should be larger than 150 meV \u00c52 .\nThis is in disagreement with the much smaller experimental values. We argue that the physical mechanism which\nappears to be responsible for such small values should\nbe the inhomogeneous nature of the as grown sample instead of the reduction of the magnetically active localized\nspins. In ref. [10], we could explain the measured TC in\nas grown sample by just estimating for each of them xeff\nbut with no need to take into account of the inhomogeneous nature. Thus D is more sensitive to the presence\nof inhomogeneities than the Curie temperature [21].\nTo conclude, we have calculated the magnetic excitation spectrum in dilute ferromagnets within a theory\nbased on the Self-consistent Local RPA. The theory is\ngeneral and allows to treat disorder and thermal fluctuations in a reliable manner. As an illustration, we have\ncalculated the spectrum in well annealed sample of GaMnAs as a function of the impurity concentration. It is predicted that well defined excitation can be observed only\nin a restricted region of the momentum space centered\naround the \u0393 point. A good agreement with experimental values of the spin stiffness was obtained for the annealed sample with concentration x = 0.03. We have also\ndiscussed and provided an explanation to the very small\nvalue of the spin stiffness measured in as grown samples.\nWe hope that this theoretical study will motivate new\nexperimental measurements for example D as a function\n\nof the impurity concentration and as a function of the\nannealing treatment.\nI would like to thank E.
