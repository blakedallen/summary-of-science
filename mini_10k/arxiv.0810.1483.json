Reinforcement is a mechanism that provides a bias to a system,\nmaking it more likely to occupy states the more often those states are visited.\nSome well-studied examples include variations on the urn of P\u00f3lya (the original\nintroduced in [4] and this and subsequent models studied, for example, in [1]\nand [9]) and reinforced random walks ([3, 15]). The infinite memory exhibited\nin these examples can force a system to spend most (or almost all) of its time\nin a small subset of its state space. Many natural phenomena exhibit similar\nbehavior; for instance, the overall pattern of erosion on a hillslope is relatively\nstable once it is established, although small details of the pattern may change\nfrequently and catastrophes that permanently alter it may occasionally occur.\n\u2217 Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, 251 Mercer St., New York, NY 10012, USA.\nEmail: damron@cims.nyu.edu; Research supported in part by NSF grant number OISE0730136.\n\u2020 National Center for Atmospheric Research, 1850 Table Mesa Dr., Boulder, CO 80305,\nUSA.

The lattice starts out smooth in the sense\nthat it has no edges initially, but it sprouts edges everywhere the instant the\nprocess starts, much as rain can start soil erosion everywhere on a hillslope at\nonce. Edges may connect an interior node to two, one, or neither of the two\nnodes directly above it. Exactly one edge descends from each interior node, and\nit points either left or right. At every node and at every time step a simple two\nparameter reinforcing law, based on the entire history of the network above a\ngiven interior node, randomly determines the direction of the nodes descending\nedge and then is updated. Obvious modifications of these statements apply to\nnodes at the top or bottom (if one exists) of the lattice.\nThe current pattern of connections among nodes represents the present state\nof the process, and the patterns stability \u2013 measured by the tendency of the same\nstate, or one similar to it, to occur on subsequent iterations of the process \u2013\nrepresents the patterns strength as a memory. The degree of reinforcement is set\nby tuning two parameters, r and \u03b1. At any given moment the current pattern\nis a collection of dendritic networks that appears similar to drainage networks\nfound in nature; indeed, lattice models have often been used to investigate the\nmorphology of natural drainage networks (e.g. [17]). We focus on the surficial\ndynamics of rill networks [10], rather than their morphology. Put in terms of\nerosion, we are more interested in the process of erosion than we are in the\nresult.\nThe analogy between our model and erosion, specifically rill erosion, is\nstraightforward: r can be interpreted as a rainfall rate (or equivalently, as the\nrate of sediment generation) and \u03b1\u22121 as the resistance of soil to erosion, while\nthe reinforcement dynamics correspond to the overland flow of water and sediment down a hill. Rills are small, ephemeral channels that transport sediment\ndown hillslopes when it rains [18]. They form when rainfall and runoff dislodge\nparticles from the soil surface and transport them along flow paths governed\nby variations in the surface roughness of soils and the soil's ability to resist\nerosion. Flow depths in rills are typically on the order of a few centimeters or\nless, while the longest channels in rill networks can be several meters long. Processes affecting rill erosion take place over timescales ranging from milliseconds\nto hours.\nThe topology of rill networks is relatively unstable when compared to larger\nscale natural drainage systems (of which rills may be a part) like gulley systems\nand river basins. Rill networks are most unstable at their tops where boundaries between rills and inter-rill areas are not well defined and shift often, but\nconnectivity can change downhill as well, usually at a slower rate than uphill.\nSome rills grow throughout a rainfall event, others are filled by sediment and\ndisappear, still others alternate. A detailed description of rill erosion 1) must\naccount for complicated interactions among rainfall, soil properties, and topography [19], and 2) often depends on obtaining a set of physical parameters that\nare difficult to measure.\nDespite the high degree of complexity of rill erosion at small scales, at macro2\n\n\fscopic scales it is principally determined by particle detachment, overland flow,\nand sediment transport ([16]). In turn, each of flow, detachment, and transport\ndepends critically on the rate of rainfall and the soils resistance to erosion. It is\nnot completely surprising that our simple two parameter model exhibits some\nimportant elements of the macroscopic behavior of rills formation. In fact, similar to rill erosion, each node in the model network switches direction infinitely\nmany times but the switching rate depends on position up or down hill. Furthermore, floods that carry unusually large amounts of water and catastrophes\nthat significantly alter the flow pattern occur occasionally in the model, as they\ndo in nature.\n\n1.2\n\nDefinition of the Model\n\nConsider the vertices in the even sub-lattice of Z2 which have second coordinate\nnon-positive. That is, the set\nZ2even = {(x, y) \u2208 Z2 : x + y is even and y \u2264 0}\nand edges\nE2even = {< (x, y), (x + 1, y \u2212 1) >: (x, y) \u2208 Z2even }\n\u222a{< (x, y), (x \u2212 1, y \u2212 1) >: (x, y) \u2208 Z2even }\nLet v = (x, y) be a node with left parent w1 = (x \u2212 1, y + 1), right parent\nw2 = (x + 1, y + 1) (for those nodes with second coordinate 0, parents will not\nexist), and with left child (x \u2212 1, y \u2212 1), right child (x + 1, y \u2212 1). We will\nuse the term depth k to refer to those nodes with y coordinate equal to 1 \u2212 k.\nConversely, for any node v the term depth(v) will denote the numerical value\nof the depth of v.\nFirst we describe the algorithm for the behavior of v heuristically. At the\nend of the 0th second, v receives Iv (0) = r units of rain (but does nothing else).\nDuring the nth second, for n \u2265 1, the following sequence occurs:\n1. v flips a coin, heads-biased with probability PvL (n), which reflects TvL (n),\nthe total \"sediment\" load v has sent to its left child by time n.\n2. If this coin shows heads (tails), v sends its current input of sediment\nIv (n \u2212 1) to its left (right) child. v adds this number to the total sediment,\nTvL (n) (TvR (n)), it has sent to the left (right) for all time.\n3. v receives sediment load from 0,1, or 2 parents and receives r units of rain.\nCall the sum of these two Iv (n). Increment time and return to step 1.\nThe evolution of the node's behavior depends on two parameters: the rainfall\nrate r > 0 and a term \u03b1\u22121 > 0 that resists change. To make this precise, we\nmake several definitions. We start by initializing variables. For each v \u2208 Z2even ,\nlet\n3\n\n\fTvL (0) = TvR (0) = Tv (0) = 0\nand\nIv (0) = r , PvL (0) = PvR (0) = 1/2\nFor each n \u2265 1, v \u2208 Z2even , we define a Bernoulli variable, DvL (n), the biased\ncoin, that is conditionally independent from vertex to vertex given the variables\n{DvL (i) : v \u2208 Z2even , i < n}, with parameter PvL (n \u2212 1). Next, let\nTvL (n) = Iv (n \u2212 1)DvL (n) + TvL (n \u2212 1)\nTv (n) = Iv (n \u2212 1) + Tv (n \u2212 1) , TvR (n) = Tv (n) \u2212 TvL (n)\nWe create the bias for the next coin:\nPvL (n)\n\nT L (n) + \u03b1\n= v\n=\nTv (n) + 2\u03b1\n\nTvL (n)\n+\u03b7\nr\nTv (n)\n+ 2\u03b7\nr\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b7 = \u03b1/r compares the effect of the rain to the system's inherent resistance\nto change. In this paper, we shall always take r = 1 so that \u03b7 = \u03b1. Last we\ndefine the input\n(\nIv (n) =\n\nr\nL\nL\nIw1 (n \u2212 1)(1 \u2212 Dw\n(n))\n+\nIw2 (n \u2212 1)Dw\n(n) + r\n1\n2\n\ndepth(v) = 1\notherwise\n\nand the filtration\nFn = \u03c3({DvL (k) : v \u2208 Z2even , k = 1, ..., n})\nSee Figure 1 for an illustration of the process at node v.\nDenote by dv = (dv (1), dv (2), ...) the sequence of directions that node v\nchooses (for example (L,R,L,...)). At the end of time t, after all nodes have\nsent loads to their children, we may update certain edge variables. Define a\nsequence of edge configurations {\u03c9n }n\u22650 , where for each n, \u03c9n is a map from\nE2even \u2192 {0, 1}, using the following rule. If the node v = (x, y) has dv (n) = L\nthen let\n\u03c9n (< x \u2212 1, y \u2212 1 >) = 1 , \u03c9n (< x + 1, y \u2212 1 >) = 0\nIf, on the other hand, dv (n) = R then let\n\u03c9n (< x \u2212 1, y \u2212 1 >) = 0 , \u03c9n (< x + 1, y \u2212 1 >) = 1\nSee Figure 1 for a realization of \u03c9n .\nWe say that nodes v and w are connected at time n if there exists a path of\ndistinct adjacent edges e1 , .., em with \u03c9n (ei ) = 1 for all i so that e1 connects v\n4\n\n\fFigure 1: Left: Input and output behavior at node v. The darkened line segments indicate paths of sediment flow. The light line represents a potential flow\npath. Right: A small piece of a visualization of \u03c9n for some n. Only edges e\nwith \u03c9n (e) = 1 are solid.\nto one of its children and em connects w to one of its parents. Denote by Cv,n\nthe set of vertices which are connected to v at time n and define the backward\n(uphill) component of v = (x, y) at time n by\n+\nCv,n\n:= Cv,n \u2229 {(x0 , y 0 ) : y 0 \u2265 y}\n\nFinally, let \u03c9n\u22121 = {e : \u03c9n (e) = 1}.\n\n1.3\n\nRegimes for \u03b7\n\nThe parameter \u03b7 plays an important role in the behavior of the model. For a\nfixed node v (at depth k) we have that for all n \u2265 1\nlim P(dv (n) = L|dv (0) = R) = 0\n\n\u03b7\u21920\n\nThis indicates that when \u03b7 is small the node v chooses a direction at time 0\nand has a high probability of sticking to this direction for most values of n \u2265 1.\nSince this is true for each node v, the evolution of {\u03c9n } is somewhat simple. In\nthe limit as \u03b7 \u2192 0, each node picks a direction and stays with that direction for\nall time. That is, for each n \u2265 1, and for each finite subset E \u2282 E2even ,\nlim P(\u03c90\u22121 (1) \u2229 E = \u03c9n\u22121 (1) \u2229 E) = 1\n\n\u03b7\u21920\n\n(2)\n\nand the dynamics has no effect on the configuration in any finite subset of Z2even .\nThe configurations at any moment are the same as those in the discrete web\n([2], [7]).\nIn the other direction, as \u03b7 \u2192 \u221e each node \"forgets\" its history. That is,\nfor each node v, the conditional probability given Fn that it chooses left at time\nn + 1 is given in (1), and the limit of this quantity is 1/2. By symmetry,\n5\n\n\fP(dv (n + 1) = L) = 1/2 = P(dv (n + 1) = R)\nand so\nlim [P(dv (n + 1) = L) \u2212 P(dv (n + 1) = L|Fn )] = 0.\n\n\u03b7\u2192\u221e\n\nTherefore the variables in any finite subset of {dv (n) : n \u2265 0} converge in\ndistribution to i.i.d. Bernoulli(1/2) variables. Furthermore, the variables in\nany finite subset of {dv (n) : n \u2265 0, v \u2208 Z2even } converge in distribution to\ni.i.d. Bernoulli(1/2) variables. Intuitively this holds because distinct nodes\nonly interact with each other through their input and output loads, and both of\nthese are eventually dominated by large \u03b7. These statements indicate that when\n\u03b7 is large, the dynamics of our erosion model are similar to those in a network\nin which each node flips a fair coin at each time n, independently from site to\nsite and from time to time, to determine in which direction to send sediment.\nThus the configurations {\u03c9n } resemble those taken from the dynamical discrete\nweb ([11], [7]).\nGiven the relation both these extreme cases have to the variables {\u03c9n }, it is\nnatural to view the present model (with 0 < \u03b7 < \u221e) as an interpolation between\nthe discrete web and the dynamical discrete web. Indeed, for each fixed n, the\ndistribution of \u03c9n is the same as that in the case of \u03b7 = 0 at time n = 0 or that\nin the case of \u03b7 \u2192 \u221e at any time n. (In both cases, all directions are chosen by\nindependent fair coin flips).\nAs we shall see in section 3.2.2, the model with 0 < \u03b7 < \u221e can be likened\nto the case \u03b7 \u2192 \u221e in the following way. Each level k is associated to a measure\n\u03b8k (defined in eq. (8)). Each node at level k samples (non-independently) from\nthis measure a value pv . For any sequence n1 , n2 , ..., nm of times and for any\nsequence x1 , ..., xm of elements from the set {L, R},\nNR\nL\nlim P(dv (n1 + T ) = x1 , ..., dv (nm + T ) = xm ) = pN\nv (1 \u2212 pv )\n\nT \u2192\u221e\n\nwhere NL (NR ) is the number of i for which di = L. Because of this fact, we\nmay view the model (for large time) as one in which each node fixes a Bernoulli\nparameter pv and flips a pv -biased coin independently each second n (but not\nindependently from site to site) to determine the direction in which to move\nsediment.\n\n1.4\n\nOutline of the Paper\n\nIn section 2 we discuss the (relatively simple) behavior of nodes at depth 1.\nSince these nodes receive constant input load over time, we can use the well\nknown model of P\u00f3lya's Urn to analyze their output. In section 3 we discuss\nthe more complicated behavior of nodes at depth at least 2. Here we make use\nof results of Pemantle [14] for the time-dependent P\u00f3lya Urn. We look more\nclosely at properties of the input load, of the output load, and of the dynamics\nof these lower-depth nodes.\n6\n\n\f2\n\nTop Level\n\nSince our top level nodes are equivalent to the model of P\u00f3lya's urn, we recall\nbasic facts of P\u00f3lya's model Start with an urn containing R0 red balls and B0\nblack balls and draw one ball from the urn. Return this ball to the urn, along\nwith another ball of the same color. After this round there are R1 red balls in\nthe urn and B1 black balls in the urn, with either R0 = R1 or B0 = B1 . Repeat\nthis process infinitely many times, creating sequences {Rn }n\u22650 and {Bn }n\u22650 so\nthat for each n,\nP(Rn+1 \u2212 Rn = 1|Rn , Bn ) =\n\nRn\nRn + Bn\n\nn\nIt is well known that the fraction FnR = RnR+B\nhas an almost sure limit and\nn\nthat this limit is distributed as \u03b2(R0 , B0 ) (see e.g. [8]).\nLet v be a node at depth 1. At the beginning of each second, v receives an\namount of sediment equal to 1 and this input load amount does not change with\ntime. The node sends this load either to the right or left, depending on the bias\nrule in (1). We are interested in the fraction of total load the node sends left\n(right) up to time n. To this end, define the load fraction\n\nLFvL (n) =\n\nTvL (n)\nT R (n)\n, LFvR (n) = v\n,n\u22651\nTv (n)\nTv (n)\n\nTheorem 2.1. The quantities LFvL (n) and LFvR (n) have limits as n \u2192 \u221e.\nThese limits are random: they are distributed as \u03b2(\u03b7, \u03b7).\nProof. We will indicate the proof only for the case LFvL (n). An easy calculation\nshows that PvL (n) is a martingale w.r.t. {Fn } and, since it is bounded for all\nn, it has an almost sure limit. Solving for the limiting distribution is similar\nto solving for the related quantity in the standard P\u00f3lya urn model. See, for\ninstance, [5]. This gives\nlim\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nPvL (n)\n\nT L (n) + \u03b7\n= lim v\n= lim\nn\u2192\u221e Tv (n) + 2\u03b7\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nTvL (n)\nTv (n)\n\n1+\n\nTvL (n)\n= lim LFvL (n)\nn\u2192\u221e Tv (n)\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n= lim\n\n\u03b7\nTv (n)\n2\u03b7\nTv (n)\n\n+\n\n(3)\n\nbecause \u03b7 is constant w.r.t. n and Tv (n) \u2192 \u221e.\nNote that the limiting distribution in Theorem 2.1 is supported on [0,1] and\nhas no atoms. This implies that with probability 1, the node v switches states\n(L,R) infinitely often and that neither of these states is transient. This is quite\nunlike the \"sticking\" associated to the dynamics in the \u03b7 \u2192 0 limit (refer to (2)).\nThe distribution from the above theorem for different values of \u03b7 is pictured in\nFigure 2. For 0 < \u03b7 < 1 the limiting load fraction has a bimodal distribution,\nand for \u03b7 > 1 the distribution is unimodal, symmetric about 12 . This means\n7\n\n\f\u03b7=\n\n1\n2\n\n\u03b7=1\n\n\u03b7=2\n\nFigure 2: Asymptotic distributions for LFvL (n): \u03b7 = .5, 1, 2 respectively.\nthat when \u03b7 is small, each node is likely to have a relatively strong preference\nfor one direction and that when \u03b7 is large, each node is likely to favor L and\nR somewhat equally. The case \u03b7 = 1 gives a uniform distribution. Here v is\nequally likely to have a strong directional preference as it is not to.\n\n3\n\nLower Levels\n\nThe simplicity of behavior at the top level comes from the fact that each node\nhas an input load which is constant w.r.t. time. This is not true at lower levels.\nEach node has an input load whose magnitude is non-trivially time dependent.\nTo make this more apparent, isolate an arbitrary node v at depth k. If at time\nt = n, v is not connected to either of its parents in \u03c9n , then its input load\nis 1 unit (coming only from rain). If, on the other hand, v is connected to\nat least one of its parents, then its input load will be strictly greater than 1\nunit. Therefore, the geometry of the connected components of \u03c9n determines\nthe behavior of each node. This relationship is complex for at least two reasons.\nFirst, not only does the geometry of the network influence node behavior, the\nnode behavior in turn determines the future geometry of the network. In this\nsense, our system generates its own randomness. Second, the method by which\nthis randomness arises involves propagation. The geometry of nodes at depth\nk \u2212 l at time m affects the behavior of nodes at depth k at time n if and only\nif m = n \u2212 l. In other words, it takes l seconds for the output load from depth\nk \u2212 l to reach nodes at depth k. In spite of these complications, we set out to\nanalyze these lower level nodes.\nThe node v has an input load sequence Iv = (Iv (1), Iv (2), ...), left output load sequence TvL = (TvL (1), TvL (2), ...), and output direction sequence\ndv = (dv (1), dv (2), ...). We are interested in analyzing the nature of this input sequence, the nature of the output sequence, and the relationship between\nthe two.\n\n3.1\n\nInput Load\n\nFigure 3 shows a histogram of input load values for all nodes at (a) depth\n5, (b) depth 7, and (c) depth 8 at t = 300s with \u03b7 = 1 (the precise value\n8\n\n\fRow 5\n\nRow 7\n\nRow 8\n\nFigure 3: Load distribution for k = 5, 7, 8 respectively.\nof \u03b7 does not matter, as a consequence of Theorem 3.1). The simulation was\nconducted with periodic boundary conditions, with 106 nodes per row, and with\n10 rows. Therefore, the histogram for depth k at time n = 300s should closely\napproximate the probability mass function of the distribution of the input load\nfor depth k at time n = 300s. One notices a few things. First, the support\nof the distribution at depth k is integers in the interval [1, 21 k(k + 1)]. Next,\nthe mass function appears to decrease from load value 1 to a local minimum\nat k \u2212 1, to increase for a bit to a local maximum, and then to decrease to\nthe edge of its support. About 1/4 of nodes are at the heads of rills, while the\nfraction of rills starting short of the top increases with depth. The \"bump\" in\nthe load distribution to the right of the value k \u2212 1 appears to travel to the right\nas depth increases. Looking at Figure 3, it is tempting to guess that the load\ndistribution at a given level is a mixture of a distribution for loads that start at\nthe top and one for loads that do not. Last, the different mass functions have\nseveral common values. For example, the probabilities for load values 1 to 4 are\nthe same in each figure, and the probabilities for load values 1 to 6 are the same\nin the center and right figures.\nWe present three structural theorems regarding the load distribution. The\nfirst gives basic information needed to make calculations, and the second gives us\nthe value of the first moment of the distribution. The third discusses a limiting\nmeasure for the family of loads that do not originate at the top. Because of the\nsimplicity of the first theorem, we state it without proof.\nTheorem 3.1. Basic properties of the load distribution. Let n0 be a fixed time\nand let v be a node at depth k.\na. All random variables dv (n0 ) are i.i.d. with probability\n\n1\n2\n\nof being L or R.\n\nb. The distribution of Iv (n0 ) is laterally translation invariant (i.e. along the\nx-axis) and is invariant in time for n0 \u2265 k.\n+\nc. The distribution of Iv (n0 ) is equal to the distribution of |Cw,n\n| for any\n0\nnode w with depth equal to min(n0 , k). Therefore Iv (n0 ) takes values in\n[1, n0 (n20 +1) ].\n\n9\n\n\fTheorem 3.2. Let v be a node at depth k. The mean of the load distribution\nis\n(\nn n\u2264k\nE(Iv (n)) =\nk n>k\nProof. We prove by induction on k. For k = 1, the statement is trivial, so\nconsider k > 1. Since the distribution of Iv (n) is constant for n \u2265 k, we assume\nn \u2264 k. Let Nv,k\u22121 be the number of nodes at level k\u22121 which send sediment to v\nat the end of time n \u2212 1. This variable takes values in {0, 1, 2} with probabilities\n{1/4, 1/2, 1/4}, respectively. Call w1 (w2 ) the left (right) parent of v.\nE(Iv (n)) =\n\n2\nX\n\nE(Iv (n)|Nv,k\u22121 = i)P(Nv,k\u22121 = i)\n\ni=1\n\n= 1/4 + 1/2 [1 + E(Iw1 (n \u2212 1))] + 1/4 [1 + E(Iw1 (n \u2212 1) + Iw2 (n \u2212 1))]\n= 1 + E(Iw2 (n \u2212 1)) = 1 + (n \u2212 1) = n\nwhere to go from the second line to the third line, we use the fact that the\nvariables Iw1 (n \u2212 1) and Iw2 (n \u2212 1) have the same distribution (see b. under\nTheorem 3.1).\nTheorem 3.1 lets us use geometric properties of clusters of a static network\n(\u03c9n0 ) to study something which is dynamic: the load at time n at node v. That\nload may have come from a pathway that no longer even exists at time n. We\nfurther exploit this relationship, but to do this we must consider the concept\nof the dual web, defined in, for example, [7], and of whose definition we remind\nthe reader. Consider the odd sublattice\nZ2odd = {(x, y) \u2208 Z2 : x + y odd and y \u2264 1}\nFor any node v \u2217 = (x\u2217 , y \u2217 ) \u2208 Z2odd we call the node (x\u2217 + 1, y \u2217 + 1) the right\nchild of v \u2217 and we call the node (x\u2217 \u2212 1, y \u2217 + 1) the left child of v \u2217 . Similarly,\nwe call the node (x\u2217 + 1, y \u2217 \u2212 1) the right parent of v \u2217 and we call the node\n(x\u2217 \u2212 1, y \u2217 \u2212 1) the left parent of v \u2217 . We define the set E2odd in the obvious\nway. The set of configurations {\u03c9n : n \u2265 0} induces a set of configurations\n2\n{\u03c9n\u2217 : n \u2265 0} \u2282 {0, 1}Eodd by the following rule. If, in the configuration \u03c9n , a\nnode v = (x, y) is connected to its left child, we form a connection between the\nnode v \u2217 = (x, y \u2212 1) and its right child in the configuration \u03c9n\u2217 by setting the\nimage under \u03c9n\u2217 of the edge in E2odd between v \u2217 and its right child to 1, and the\nimage of the edge between v \u2217 and its left child to 0. If, on the other hand, v\nis connected to its right child in \u03c9n then we set the image of the edge from v \u2217\nto its left child under \u03c9n\u2217 to 1 and the image of the edge from v \u2217 to its right\nchild to 0. See Figure 4 and notice that we construct clusters in \u03c9n\u2217 so that no\noccupied edges in \u03c9n\u2217 cross any occupied edges in \u03c9n .\n10\n\n\fFigure 4: Portion of an realization of the erosion network, along with its dual\nweb. The solid lines indicate paths of sediment flow and the dotted lines show\npaths of the dual (courtesy of [6]).\nThe upward paths in \u03c9n\u2217 now resemble the downward paths in \u03c9n . That\nis, the upward path starting at the node v \u2217 is a simple symmetric random\nwalk which is killed at depth 1. Random walks starting at different nodes are\nindependent until they meet, at which point they coalesce into one random\nwalk. (This is similar to the coalescing random walks picture of the discrete\nweb, described in [2], [11], [7].)\nThere is an obvious physical interpretation for the paths in the dual web. For\nany two adjacent paths in the configuration \u03c9n , there is a path in \u03c9n\u2217 separating\nthem. If the paths in \u03c9n represent rills or drains, the paths in \u03c9n\u2217 represent the\ndivides or ridges between them. Just as divides between rills do not cross rills,\npaths in \u03c9n\u2217 do not cross paths in \u03c9n .\nWe now characterize the load distributions for our model. For any node\n\u2217\n\u2217\n= (x \u2212 1, y) and let vR\n= (x + 1, y). Consider\nv = (x, y) (with depth k), let vL\nthe set of edges in the dual lattice contained in the paths emanating from the\n\u2217\n\u2217\nvertices vR\nand vL\nin \u03c9n\u2217 until either (a) they meet at some vertex w\u2217 or (b)\nthey reach a depth of 1. The set of nodes in Z2even in the interior of this set of\nedges is exactly the backward cluster of v in the configuration \u03c9n .\nWe now make some definitions so that we can work with this load distribution. Let {XiL : i \u2265 2} and {XiR : i \u2265 2} be independent sets of random variables (also independent of each other) which take the values 1 and -1\neach with probability 21 . For i \u2265 2 let Yi = 21 (XiR \u2212 XiL ) and for i \u2265 1, let\nWi = 1 + Y2 + ... + Yi . Consider the stopping time\n\u03c4 = min{n : Wn = 0}\nUp until the stopping time \u03c4 , the random variable Wi represents the width\n11\n\n\fof the backward cluster of the node v in the real lattice (only valleys and not\nseparating ridges), where we only consider nodes in this cluster whose depths\nare between k \u2212 i + 1 and k. Therefore the total number of nodes in this partial\ncluster should be\nLi := W1 + ... + Wi\nNow we can make an equivalent definition of the distribution of the load\nIv (n) by saying that for each fixed n, it is the same as the distribution of the\nrandom variable\nLk (n) := Lmin(\u03c4,n,k)\n\n(4)\n\nThis variable is essentially a discrete integral of the symmetric random walk\n{Wi : i \u2265 1}.\nTheorem 3.3. Let v be a node at depth kv and let w be a node at depth kw \u2265 kv .\nFor any n \u2265 kv and for any l < kv we have\nP(Iv (n) = l) = P(Iw (n) = l)\nTherefore the limit\nlim Iv (kv )\n\nkv \u2192\u221e\n\n(5)\n\nexists in distribution. This limit is a.s. finite but has infinite mean.\nProof. On the event \u03c4 \u2265 kv , i.e. the load originated from the top,\nIv (n) = Lmin(\u03c4,n,kv ) = Lkv \u2265 kv > l\nand\nIw (n) = Lmin(\u03c4,n,kw ) \u2265 Lmin(\u03c4,n,kv ) > l\nHence, we need only consider \u03c4 < kv .\nP(Iv (n) = l) = P(Iv (n) = l, \u03c4 < kv ) = P(Lmin(\u03c4,n) = l, \u03c4 < kv )\n= P(Lmin(\u03c4,n,kw ) = l, \u03c4 < kv ) = P(Iw (n) = l)\n\n(6)\n\nThe random variable Lkv (n) is constant for n \u2265 kv , so\nP(Iv (kv ) = l) = P(Iv (kw ) = l) = P(Iw (kw ) = l)\nwhere in the last equality we use (6). Consequently, for any fixed l, the limit\nlim P(Iv (kv ) = l)\n\nkv \u2192\u221e\n\n12\n\n\fexists. By the definition (4), a random variable with this limiting distribution\nis\nL\u221e := lim Lmin(\u03c4,k,k) = L\u03c4\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nSince\n\u03c4 (\u03c4 + 1)\n2\nthe third statement of the theorem will follow if we show that \u03c4 is a.s. finite and\nhas infinite mean. But since the increments {Yi } of the random walk {Wi } have\nmean zero, the walk is recurrent. In addition, it is a standard result that the\nentrance time of the set {0} has infinite mean. This completes the proof.\n\u03c4 \u2264 L\u03c4 \u2264\n\n3.2\n\nDynamics\n\nNow we investigate some aspects of the effect of \u03b7 on the stability of configurations over time. As noted, the dynamics creates an interpolation between\nthe discrete web and the discrete dynamical web. The evolution of the system\nmirrors some aspects of rill erosion, one being that nodes through which a large\namount of water passes at time n0 have a non-trivial probability to channel a\nlarge amount of water at any time n1 > n0 . The degree to which this is true\ndepends on the parameter \u03b7, as we will see.\n3.2.1\n\nLoad Correlation\n\nWe start our analysis by inspecting simulation results. For any two positive\nintegers M, N , let VM,N be an enumeration of the M N nodes in the box [0, M \u2212\n1] \u00d7 [\u2212N, \u22121] and define the load correlation coefficient at time n (for n \u2265 N )\nby\nP\n0\n0\nv\u2208VM,N Iv (N )Iv (n)\nKM,N (n) = q P\nP\n( v\u2208VM,N Iv0 (N )2 )( v\u2208VM,N Iv0 (n)2 )\nwhere Iv0 (n) = Iv (n)\u2212E(Iv (n)). This quantity is only defined for n \u2265 N because\ntwo load vectors for a box of depth N are in some sense incomparable if they are\ntaken at times n0 , n1 with n0 < N \u2264 n1 . For example, a node at depth n only\nhas a maximum possible load of n(n+1)\nat time n < N , whereas its maximum\n2\nN (N +1)\npossible load is\nfor n \u2265 N .\n2\nIn Figure 5 we have graphed simulation results for a network 49 nodes deep\nand 49 nodes wide. The x-axis represents values of the parameter \u03b7, as it\nvaries from 0 to 5. The y-axis represents values of a time averaged correlation\ncoefficient, namely the quantity\n0\n\nN\nX\n1\nKM,N (n)\nN0 \u2212 N\nn=N\n\n13\n\n\fFigure 5: Averaged load correlation (vertical axis) versus \u03b7 (horizontal axis).\nData points are taken at \u03b7-intervals of 0.1 until \u03b7 = 2, and then at intervals of\n1.\nfor M = N = 49 and N 0 = 200. Furthermore, we averaged this value over 6\nindependent trials. This quantity is meant to approximate values of KM,N (n)\nfor M, N, n large. The time averaging seemed necessary because of fluctuations,\nmost likely due to finite size conditions, in the quantity KM,N (n).\nWe can see in Figure 5 that the coefficient approaches 1 as \u03b7 \u2192 0. This\nmakes sense because, as remarked in section 1.3, the \u03b7 \u2192 0 limit of the dynamics (in any fixed box) is the same as the dynamics (or rather non-dynamics) of\nthe discrete web. Therefore the load vector for this box should be similar (if not\nthe same) at any two times. As \u03b7 increases, the correlation coefficient decreases\nand appears to approach 0. Indeed, additional simulations give the following\ndata: for \u03b7 = 10, 100, 1000, 10000, the coefficients were .2391, .0896, .0189, and\n.0101,. From the discussion of the \u03b7 \u2192 \u221e limit given in section 1.3, the correlation coefficient should approach that computed from two load vectors from\nindependent realizations of the discrete web.\n3.2.2\n\nde Finetti Measures\n\nWhereas we can compare nodes at the top level to standard P\u00f3lya urns, we can\ncompare lower level nodes to time-dependent input [14] or random input [13]\nP\u00f3lya urns. We start with an urn with R0 red balls and B0 black balls, as before,\nbut we also have a time-dependent (or random) input sequence I = (I0 , I1 , ...).\nAt time t = n we draw a ball from the urn and we return it to the urn along\nwith In balls of the same color. Notice that this process with I = (1, 1, ...) is\njust the standard P\u00f3lya urn.\nTo analyze these lower level nodes, we will also make use of a fundamental\nresult in the theory of exchangeable variables.\n\n14\n\n\fDefinition 3.4. {0, 1}-valued variables X1 , X2 , ... are exchangeable if for any\nx1 , ..., xm \u2208 {0, 1} and for any permutation \u03c3 of m elements we have\nP(X1 = x1 , ..., Xm = xm ) = P(X\u03c3(1) = x1 , ..., X\u03c3(m) = xm )\nTheorem 3.5 (de Finetti). Let (\u03a9, F, P) be a probability space and suppose that\n{Xn }n\u22650 are exchangeable {0, 1}-valued random variables defined on \u03a9. Then\nthere exists a random variable F on \u03a9 so that conditioned on F , the random\nvariables Xn are independent Bernoulli with parameter F .\nIt is easy to verify that if depth(v) = 1, then the {0, 1}-valued variables\n{DvL (n)}n\u22650 are exchangeable. In our case, the variable F from Theorem 3.5 is\nactually\npv := lim PvL (n).\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n(7)\n\nThus if we know the asymptotic fraction of left choices for a node, then our\nnode is just flipping independent coins each second with the same bias.\nAt lower levels, the variables {DvL (n)} are not exchangeable. However, they\nare asymptotically exchangeable. We use the definition of Kingman [12].\nDefinition 3.6. {0, 1}-valued random variables X1 , X2 , ... are called asymptotically exchangeable if there exists a sequence Y1 , Y2 , ... of exchangeable\nrandom variables so that for each x1 , ..., xm \u2208 {0, 1},\nlim P(X1+N = x1 , ..., Xm+N = xm )\n\nN \u2192\u221e\n\n= P(Y1 = x1 , ..., Ym = xm )\nIn the language of Theorem 3.5, let F be the random variable associated with\nthe exchangeable variables {Xn }. We call F the de Finetti measure for the\nsequence {Yn }.\nLet v be a node with depth k \u2265 1.\nTheorem 3.7. The variables {PvL (n)}n\u22650 form a bounded martingale sequence\nw.r.t. Fn . Therefore they have an almost sure limit pv .\nProof. Similar to the proof of [13, Theorem 2.1]\nRemark 3.8. Using the same equations which produce (3), the limit in Theorem\n3.7 is the same as the limit of the variables {LFvL (n)}n\u22650 .\nFor any number 0 \u2264 p \u2264 1, define the measure Qp on the set {0, 1} by\nQp ({0}) = 1 \u2212 p , Qp ({1}) = p\nLet {v1 , ..., vr } be a finite set of vertices. For any vector of real numbers\n(p1 , ..., pr ), each between 0 and 1, define\nQr the product measure Qp~ on vectors\nin {0, 1}r to be the product measure i=1 Qpi .\n15\n\n\fTheorem 3.9. For fixed v, the variables {DvL (n) : n \u2265 1} are asymptotically exchangeable with de Finetti measure equal to the distribution of pv .\nFurthermore, let ~v = (v1 , ..., vr ) be a vector of vertices and for each n, let\nD~vL (n) = (DvL1 (n), ..., Dvr (n)). If d~1 , ..., d~s are vectors in {0, 1}r , with probability one,\nlim P(D~vL (1 + T ) = d~1 , ..., D~vL (s + T ) = d~s ) = E(\n\nT \u2192\u221e\n\ns\nY\n\nQp~ (d~i ))\n\ni=1\n\nwhere p~ = (pv1 , ..., pvr ).\nProof. Similar to the proof of [13, Theorem 2.2].\nBecause of lateral translation invariance, the de Finetti measure for v depends only on the depth k. In light of this, we define\n\u03b8k = de Finetti measure for row k\n\n(8)\n\nWith this framework we will be able to study the switching rate of each node v\nonce we have the following lemma.\nLemma 3.10.

This completes\nthe proof.\n\n17\n\n\fIf pv \u2208 (0, 1) then neither of the choices L or R are transient for v. This\nprompts the question of whether or not the de Finetti measures \u03b8k have atoms\nat 0 or 1. For any fixed k, the answer is no.\nTheorem 3.12. For each k \u2265 1, the measure \u03b8k has no atoms.\nProof. In [14, Theorem 4] it is shown that a time-dependent input P\u00f3lya urn's\nde Finetti measure cannot have atoms if there is a C so that Iv (n) \u2264 C for all n.\nFor each realization of the dynamics and for each v, we have Iv (n) \u2264 kv (k2v +1)\nfor all n. The result follows.\nCorollary 3.13. Each node v has a nonzero asymptotic switching rate. Therefore, for each v, the states L and R are recurrent.\nProof. This is a direct consequence of Lemma 3.10 and Theorem 3.12.\nCorollary 3.14. With probability one, for each node v, the variable Iv (n) takes\neach value in [1, kv (k2v +1) ] for infinitely many values of n.\nProof. Let v1 , ..., vm be the m = kv (k2v +1) \u2212 1 nodes above v which can send\nsediment to v and let d~1 , ..., d~vk \u2208 {0, 1}m . Let N \u2265 1 and write D~vL (n) for the\nvector (DvL1 (n), ..., DvLm (n)).\nlim\n\nlim P(D~vL (T +jkv +1) = d~1 , ..., D~vL (T +(j+1)kv ) = d~kv for some 1 \u2264 j \u2264 N )\n\nN \u2192\u221e T \u2192\u221e\n\nequals zero almost surely, by Theorem 3.9 and Theorem 3.12. But this probability dominates the probability of the event {D~vL (n + 1) = d~1 , ..., D~vL (n + vk + 1) =\nd~vk for infinitely many n}c . The result follows.\nHere an interesting picture of our network emerges. On the one hand we may\nview the system as an infinite lattice (the lower half plane), where each node is a\nrandom input P\u00f3lya urn. The output of the urns at depth k at time n becomes\nthe input of the urns at depth k+1 at time n+1. On the other hand, as remarked\nin section 1.3, we may first sample (non-independently) values {pv : v \u2208 Z2even }\nfrom the de Finetti measures {\u03b8k : k \u2265 1} to create an infinite array. As time n\napproaches infinity, the behavior of the system approaches the behavior of the\nsame network in which each node v chooses to send its current load left with\nprobability pv and right with probability 1 \u2212 pv , independently at each second.\nTherefore this picture is of a network of two variables, a realization of values pv\nfrom the de Finetti measures, and realization of dynamics which coincides with\nthe dynamics of a much simpler network. This second network is an obvious\ngeneralization of the Dynamical Discrete Web.\nFigure 6 shows histograms for the de Finetti measures \u03b8k for k = 2, 5, 9 and\nfor values of \u03b7 = .5, 1, 2. One sees that the measures become more biased as k\nincreases (for fixed \u03b7). In other words, the mass of \u03b8k is concentrated on domains\ncloser to 0 and 1 than is the mass of \u03b8k\u22121 . This would seem to imply that the\n\n18\n\n\f\u03b7 = 12 , row 2\n\n\u03b7 = 21 , row 5\n\n\u03b7 = 21 , row 9\n\n\u03b7 = 1, row 2\n\n\u03b7 = 1, row 5\n\n\u03b7 = 1, row 9\n\n\u03b7 = 2, row 2\n\n\u03b7 = 2, row 5\n\n\u03b7 = 2, row 9\n\nFigure 6: Definetti measures for k = 2, 5, 9 (from left to right) and \u03b7 = .5, 1, 2\n(from top to bottom).\nexpected asymptotic switching rate of a node at level k (which is 2pv (1 \u2212 pv ))\nmust decrease with k. Similarly, if k is fixed and \u03b7 decreases to 0, it seems that\nthe expected switching rate should decrease.\nFigure 7 represents data given by simulations conducted with an erosion\nnetwork with width 105 , depth 50, and \u03b7 = .1, 1, or 10. The simulation ran for\nn = 1000 steps and at the end, switch rates for each node in the network were\ncomputed. In each row, each node's rate was averaged. Since two nodes v1 and\nv2 with the same depth k have independent behavior as long as they are at least\na distance of 2k apart, the ergodic theorem gives that, as the network size approaches infinity, the resulting average should resemble the expected switch rate\nfor a row. The above results results were averaged by row over 3 independent\ntrials. Finally, the data were plotted by row. Not only do the average switch\nrates appear to decrease as k increases, there appears to be a non-trivial (i.e.\nnon-zero and \u03b7 dependent) limit for the switch rate. This indicates that for at\nleast some values of \u03b7, the limit of the measures \u03b8k (if it exists) is most likely\nnot equal to 21 (\u03b40 + \u03b41 ).\n\n19\n\n\fFigure 7: Average switch rate (vertical axis) versus row (horizontal axis). The\nvalues of \u03b7 are 10 (top curve), 1 (middle curve), .1 (bottom curve).\n3.2.3\n\nCatastrophes\n\nNext, we study the following situation. Suppose a node v at a large depth k (for\nthis section we assume the depth is at least 2) starts with a small input load\nand keeps a relatively small input load until a much later time. Then v's load\nchanges dramatically. If this new load is sufficiently large, it could bring v's de\nFinetti measure much closer to 12 (\u03b40 + \u03b41 ). This analysis is from the point of\nview of the node v, whereas the analysis of the last half of the section will be\nfrom the point of view of the parent.\nLet\nTv (n \u2212 1)\n,n\u22651\nAv (n) =\nn\nDefinition 3.15. For any n \u2265 1, define the flood ratio Fv (n) =\nc \u2265 1, we say that a flood of order c occurs at time n if Fv (n) \u2265 c.\n\nIv (n)\nAv (n) .\n\nFor\n\nRemark 3.16.

Therefore,\nlim inf Fv (n) < lim sup Fv (n)\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nProof. We show the first statement by induction on depth(k). Clearly this is\ntrue if depth(v) = 1. Otherwise, let w1 be the left parent of v and assume that\n20\n\n\ffor all nodes w0 with depth equal to that of w1 , Aw0 (n) has a limit. Let NwR1 (n)\nR\nbe the number of i \u2264 n such that Dw\n(i) = 0.

A simple extension of the above proof using Theorem 3.12 shows\nthat for any level k, the distribution of the time-average of the load for level k\nhas no atoms.\nFrom the previous proposition we know that if v has an asymptotic average\ninput load Av , then v will have infinitely many floods of order k(k+1)\n2Av +\u000f for any\n\u000f > 0. This number can be quite large if Av is small. We study numerically the\nrates of these large floods as they relate to both depth(v) and \u03b7.\nFor a fixed node v, define the random measure\n\u03bcv,n =\n\nn\nX\n\n\u03b4Fv (i)\n\ni=2\n\nLet {vi }i\u22651 be an enumeration of the nodes with the same depth as that of v.\nBy the ergodic theorem, the average\nM\n1 X\n\u03bcv ,n \u2192 E(\u03bcv,n )\nM i=1 i\n\nas M \u2192 \u221e. See Figure 8. The graphs come from a simulation run for 105\nseconds on a network with a width of 104 nodes and\na depth\nof 50 nodes. \u0003We\n\u0002\nP10000\ngraphed the density function for the measure 1018 i=1 \u03bcvi ,105 \u2212 \u03bcvi ,9000 in\n1\nan attempt to approximate n\u22129000\nE(\u03bcv,n ) for n large and for v with depth 5,\n20, and 50. The reason we subtracted \u03bcvi ,9000 is to decrease the effect of small\ntimes, during which the ratio Fv (n) is likely to be an integer.\n21\n\n\f\u03b7=\n\n1\n10 ,\n\nrow 5\n\n\u03b7=\n\n1\n10 ,\n\nrow 20\n\n\u03b7=\n\n1\n10 ,\n\nrow 50\n\n\u03b7 = 1, row 5\n\n\u03b7 = 1, row 20\n\n\u03b7 = 1, row 50\n\n\u03b7 = 10, row 5\n\n\u03b7 = 10, row 20\n\n\u03b7 = 10, row 50\n\nFigure 8: Histograms approximating the measure E(\u03bcv,n ) for n large.\nAs \u03b7 \u2192 0 with a fixed row or as the row increases with fixed \u03b7, each measure\nseems to concentrate its mass at 0 and 1. In other words, the measure of any\ninterval which does not include either of these two points appears to approach 0.\nIn addition, Table 1 shows that as \u03b7 \u2192 0 with a fixed row or as the row increases\nwith fixed \u03b7, the expected fraction of time during which a large flood occurs\n(ratio above 5) increases. Since the time average of flood ratios approaches 1 as\nn \u2192 \u221e, the above facts indicate a trend that as \u03b7 \u2192 0 or as the row increases,\nthe time variance of measures increases, giving more possible variability of the\nflood ratios. Although this variance seems to increase, values near 1 (on the\nx-axis) show that the fraction of time flood ratios spend near 1 increases. In\nspirit, this is in accordance with previous results, as we explain. Figure 7 shows\nthat as the row increases, the expected switching rate of a node decreases. It\nis reasonable to believe that the same conclusion holds if the depth is fixed but\n\u03b7 decreases. Therefore the network prefers to be more static in these circumstances and we would expect a node to receive a relatively constant load, forcing\nflood ratios to be near 1.\nWe now change focus to the parent. Make the following definition.\nDefinition 3.20. For any n \u2265 2, define the right catastrophe ratio\n\n22\n\n\f\u03b7\n.1\n1\n10\n\nRow 5\n.00035\n.00136\n.00024\n\nRow 20\n.00205\n.01235\n.02356\n\nRow 50\n.00308\n.01789\n.03711\n\nTable 1: Expected fraction of time during which a large flood (ratio at least 5)\noccurs.\n\nCvR (n) =\n\nIv (n)\nwhenever DvL (n) = 0\nAR\n(n)\nv\n\nT R (n\u22121)\n\nR\nR\nv\nHere, AR\nv (n) = NvR (n\u22121) , where Nv (n) is the number of i \u2264 n such that Dv (i) =\n0. For c \u2265 1, we say that a right catastrophe of order c occurs at time\nn if CvR (n) \u2265 c. Make similar definitions for left catastrophe ratio and left\ncatastrophe.\n\nRemark 3.21. From a similar argument to that used in Proposition 3.17, we\nhave\nlim inf CvR (n) < lim sup CvR (n)\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nWe investigate the relationship between floods and catastrophes. Figure 9\nshows the expected fraction of right catastrophes from the left parent which\nresult in a flood of at least the same magnitude. The simulation was performed\nwith a network of width 1000, depth 50, \u03b7 equal to either .1, 1, or 10, and for\na duration of 105 seconds. The calculation of fractions was only made between\n9000s and 10000s and we only consider catastrophes with ratio at least 1. It is\nclear from the figure that as the row increases, this expectation decreases. As\n\u03b7 decreases for a fixed row, the expectation also decreases. As n \u2192 \u221e,\nAR\nv (n) =\n\n(n \u2212 1)TvR (n \u2212 1)\n\u2192 lim Av (n)\nn\u2192\u221e\n(n \u2212 1)NvR (n \u2212 1)\n\nby Remark 3.18 and Lemma 3.10. Therefore, we may use Remark 3.19 to show\nthat almost surely for large n a right catastrophe of order c occurs for the node\nv at time n if v has a flood of order c at time n \u2212 1. In other words, whenever\na node receives a flood of order c at a large time, it has either a left or right\ncatastrophe of the same order at the next second.\nNow we may interpret the probability that a node has a flood given that its\nleft parent has a right catastrophe as the probability that a parent's catastrophe\nincites a catastrophe in the child. This would be a step of a possible catastrophe cascade. The simulation results indicate that cascades become less present\nat lower levels (on average) but that they should never cease to exist. Two\nquestions naturally arise. Given that a node has a right catastrophe of order c,\nhow far does its catastrophe cascade travel? At each step of the cascade, the\nrelevant (right or left) catastrophe ratio will generally increase. Indeed, a child\n23\n\n\fFigure 9: Expected fraction of right catastrophes from left parent which result\nin a flood of at least the same magnitude. The values of eta are 10 (top), 1\n(middle), and .1 (bottom). The data are plotted by row.\nnode may even receive a catastrophe from both parents. How large does this\nratio become in a typical cascade?\n\n4\n\nConclusion\n\nWe have shown that the erosion model exhibits many properties of rill erosion.\nEach node chooses a random initial direction (right or left) in which to send\nsediment and further such choices become biased at a rate largely determined\nby the parameter eta. This is similar to the method by which rills are cut into\na hillslope. As more water and sediment flows through a rill, a channel is cut\ndeeper, giving reinforcement to the path, making it more likely to carry sediment\nin the future. Though the dynamics manifests itself through reinforcement, no\nfixed node can become fully biased (i.e. have a de Finetti measure equal to a\nsum of two delta masses). That is, since each node has a non-trivial asymptotic\nswitching rate, sediment flow emerging from it will take both a left and right\npath a positive fraction of time. This rate of switching appears to decrease as\nwe move further down the hill.\nThere are a number of questions which deserve careful analysis. Do the\nmeasures \u03b8k have a limit? If so, one would expect the limit to be the de Finetti\nmeasure associated with the \"infinity process\". To define this process, we start\nwith a lattice of nodes which extends infinitely far in both positive and negative\ny directions. Since the behavior of a node v at time n in the present model\ndepends only on the nodes in the n \u2212 1 levels above it we may consider the\ninput to the node v at time n in the infinity model to be a function of the\n24\n\n\foutput of this finite number of ancestors. In the same way we have analyzed in\nthis paper, it is possible to show that a de Finetti measure \u03b8\u221e for this process\nexists and that\n\u03b8\u221e = lim \u03b8n (n),\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n(14)\n\nwhere the term inside the limit is the measure given by\n\u03b8n (n)([a, b]) = P(PvL (n) \u2208 [a, b]) for depth(v) = n\nDoes the measure \u03b8\u221e have atoms for some values of \u03b7? If so, is there a critical\n\u03b7\u2217 so that for 0 < \u03b7 < \u03b7\u2217 , \u03b8\u221e has atoms? If the limit of \u03b8k (assuming it\nexists) is not the same as \u03b8\u221e , does this limit have atoms and is there a critical\n\u03b7 associated with it?\nAcknowledgments.
