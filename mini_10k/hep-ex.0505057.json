We report the\nmost precise measurements of the following eight modes: pp, \u039b\u039b, \u039e\u2212 \u039e\u2212 , \u039e0 \u039e0 (first observation),\n\u03a3+ \u03a3+ (first observation), and \u03a30 \u03a30 , and place upper limits for the modes, \u039e\u22170 \u039e\u22170 and \u03a9\u2212 \u03a9\u2212 .\n\n2\n\n\fThe study of \u03c8(2S) production in e+ e\u2212 and its subsequent decay into two hadrons\nprovides a test of the predictive power of QCD [1], including information on gluon spin, quark\ndistribution amplitudes in baryon-antibaryon pairs, and total hadron helicity conservation.\nThe decays are predicted to proceed via the annihilation of the constituent cc into three\ngluons or a virtual photon. This model leads to the prediction that the ratio of the branching\nfraction into a specific final state to the branching fraction of the J/\u03a8 into that same\nstate should be a constant value of approximately 13%, the corresponding ratio for the\ndilepton final state [2]. This rule, which was previously refereed to as the \"12% rule\", is\nroughly obeyed for several channels, but fails for others [3]. This Letter concentrates on the\ninvestigation of the two-body decays of the \u03c8(2S) into a baryon-antibaryon pair. Previous\nmeasurements [4] of the \u03c8(2S) decaying into these final states have very large statistical\nuncertainties. The CLEO [5] detector, with the advantage of good charged and neutral\nparticle detection efficiencies, together with secondary and tertiary vertex reconstruction,\ngives us the opportunity to make the most precise measurements yet of these branching\nfractions.\nThe data used in this analysis were collected at the CESR e+ e\u2212 storage ring, which\nhas been reconfigured to run near cc threshold by inserting 6 wigglers [5]. Our analysis is\nbased on 3.08\u00d7106 \u03c8(2S) decays which corresponds to the total integrated luminosity of\n5.63 pb\u22121 . Approximately half of the \u03c8(2S) data (2.74 pb\u22121 ) were taken with the CLEO III\ndetector configuration [6] and\u221athe remainder (2.89 pb\u22121 ) of the \u03c8(2S) data, and all the\ncontinuum data (20.70 pb\u22121 , s = 3.67 GeV) were taken with the reconfigured CLEO-c\ndetector [5]. We generated 10,000 Monte Carlo events using simulations of each of the two\ndetector configurations for each of the eight decay modes, using a GEANT-based [7] detector\nmodeling program. For all modes we generated Monte Carlo samples with a flat distribution\nin cos \u03b8, where \u03b8 is the angle of the decay products in the center-of-mass system (in colliding\nbeam experiments this angle is measured relative to the beam axis). For spin 1/2 baryons\nin the baryon octet, we then weighted the Monte Carlo samples with a 1 + cos2 \u03b8 angular\ndistribution, in agreement with the naive expectation. Possible deviations from these angular\ndistributions will be one source of systematic uncertainty in our measurements.\nWe begin by reconstructing the hyperons in the following decay modes (branching fractions [4] are listed in parentheses): \u039b\u2192p\u03c0 \u2212 (63.9%), \u03a3+ \u2192p\u03c0 0 (51.6%), \u03a30 \u2192\u039b\u03b3(100.0%),\n\u039e\u2212 \u2192\u039b\u03c0 \u2212 (99.9%), \u039e0 \u2192\u039b\u03c0 0 (99.5%), \u039e\u22170 \u2192\u039e\u2212 \u03c0 + (51.6%), and \u03a9\u2212 \u2192\u039bK \u2212 (67.8%). To discriminate between protons, kaons, pions, and electrons, we combined specific ionization\n(dE/dx) measured in the drift chamber [6] and log-likelihoods obtained from the RICH subdetector [6] to form a joint log-likelihood difference: L(p \u2212 \u03c0) = LRICH (p) \u2212 LRICH (\u03c0) +\n2\n2\n\u03c3dE/dx\n(p) \u2212 \u03c3dE/dx\n(\u03c0), where the more negative L(p \u2212 \u03c0), the higher the likelihood that\nthe particle is a proton compared to a pion. Our requirement on these quantities varies in\nvalue from mode to mode depending upon background considerations. Further details of\nthis procedure may be found elsewhere [8]. For protons in the pp and \u03a30 decay modes we\nrequire L(p \u2212 \u03c0) < \u22129 and L(p \u2212 K) < \u22129 (3 \u03c3 separation), and for those in the pp mode\nwe require additional criteria L(p \u2212 e) < \u22129 as, in this case alone, electrons are a potentially\nsignificant background. For protons that are the daughters of \u039b decays we make the looser\nrequirements of L(p \u2212 \u03c0) < 0 and L(p \u2212 K) < 0, which are both very efficient. Kaons from\n\u03a9\u2212 decays are strongly identified with L(K \u2212 \u03c0) < \u22129 and L(K \u2212 p) < \u22129. Pions are\nonly required to have energy loss measurements consistent with the pion identity. Photon\ncandidates were identified in the CsI calorimeter.\nThe analysis procedure for reconstructing \u039b and \u039e\u2212 closely follows that presented ear3\n\n\fFIG. 1: Inclusive hyperon invariant mass distribution in \u03c8(2S) data: (a) \u039b\u2192p\u03c0 \u2212 , (b) \u03a3+ \u2192p\u03c0 0 ,\n(c) \u03a30 \u2192\u03b3\u039b, (d) \u039e\u2212 \u2192\u039b\u03c0 \u2212 , (e) \u039e0 \u2192\u039b\u03c0 0 , (f) \u039e\u22170 \u2192\u039e\u2212 \u03c0 + , (g) \u03a9\u2212 \u2192\u039bK \u2212 .\n\nlier [8]. The \u03a9\u2212 reconstruction follows the steps of the \u039e\u2212 reconstruction by replacing a\npion by a kaon. \u03a30 hyperons are reconstructed by combining a \u039b with a photon and requiring the photon energy in the crystal calorimeter to be in excess of 50 MeV, not matched\nto a charged track, and consistent in shape to that from a photon. \u039e0 and \u03a3+ hyperon\nreconstruction is complicated by the fact that there is no direction information from the CsI\nphoton clusters for the \u03c0 0 reconstruction. A kinematic fit is made to the hypothesis that\nthe parent hyperon started at the beamspot, and decayed after a positive pathlength to a\ndecay vertex which is the origin of the \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 decay. A cut was placed on the \u03c72 of the fit\nto this topology, which includes the fit to the \u03c0 0 mass from the newly found hyperon decay\nvertex. The \u039e\u22170 candidate is reconstructed by vertexing a positively charged pion candidate, consistent with coming from the beamspot, with the already found \u039e\u2212 . All hyperon\ncandidates were required to have vertices significantly separated from the beamspot, with\nthe flight distance of the \u039b measured from the parent (\u039e0 , \u039e\u2212 , or \u03a9\u2212 ) decay vertex, to be\npositive. In Figure 1 we show the inclusive hyperon yields in the \u03c8(2S) data. We observed\n48\u00d7103 \u039b candidate events in the \u03c8(2S) data as shown in Fig 1(a) with a fitted width (\u03c3)\nfound to be 1.53 MeV/c2 , consistent with Monte Carlo estimates. The fitted yields (widths)\nin Fig. 1(b) and (c) for \u03a3+ and \u03a30 candidates are approximately 3\u00d7103 (4.0 MeV/c2 ) and\n1\u00d7103 (4.7 MeV/c2 ), respectively. Invariant mass distributions for the \u039e\u2212 and \u039e0 are shown\nin Fig. 1(d) and (e), respectively. The fit yielded approximately 2.7\u00d7103 and 1.2\u00d7103 for\nthe signal events and 2.4 MeV/c2 and 3.6 MeV/c2 for widths for the \u039e\u2212 and \u039e0 candidates,\nrespectively. The fits in Fig. 1(f) and (g) yielded 115 (4.69 MeV/c2 ) and 47 (2.69 MeV/c2 )\nevents (width) for the \u039e\u22170 and \u03a9\u2212 spin 3/2 baryons. Hyperon candidates within 3\u03c3 of their\nnominal masses are considered for further analysis. We then combined the 4-momenta of\nthese baryons with the corresponding 4-momenta of their charge conjugates and formed\n\u03c8(2S) candidates.\nWe note that baryon-antibaryon pairs produced by \u03c8(2S) decays have a back-to-back\ntopology, and each decaying baryon has exactly the beam energy. Momentum conservation\nis imposed on the reconstructed baryon-antibaryon pairs by demanding the vector sum of\n4\n\n\fthe total momentum in an event |\u03a3~p|/Ebeam be less than 0.04. This eliminates background,\nvia \u03c0\u03c0J/\u03c8 or \u03b3\u03c7cn (n = 0,1, and 2), which have extra tracks or showers.\nFor\nthe scaled visible energy,\n\u221a each baryon-antibaryon candidate event, we calculated\n\u221a\nEvis / s, where Evis is the energy observed \u221a\nin an event and s is the center of mass energy.\nWe define our signal region be 0.98 < Evis / s < 1.02, and two sideband regions of 0.94-0.98\nand 1.02-1.06 as representative of the combinatorial background.\nWe also studied the continuum data to check for a possible contribution to our \u03c8(2S)\nsignals from this source. This was found to be non-negligible for four of the decay modes as\nshown in Table I. We multiplied the yield from the continuum data by a scaling factor which\nwas calculated taking into account the differences in luminosity (0.2720), a 1/s5 correction\n(0.9572) for baryons [1], and the values of the efficiencies in the CLEO III and CLEO-c\ndetector configurations before subtracting it from the \u03c8(2S) yields. This scaling factor was\n0.2547 for the pp case and similar for the other modes.\nOther possible background sources are the daughters from the J/\u03c8 decay combined with\nthe charged or neutral transition pions which can produce possible cross-feed in the signal region. To estimate this cross-feed we generated corresponding Monte Carlo samples of 20,000\nevents and looked for events which passed our selection criteria for the modes concerned.\nFigure 2 shows the scaled energy distribution for each of the decay modes. In all cases,\nclear signals are seen, with widths as expected from Monte Carlo simulation, and very little\ncombinatorial background in the sideband regions. In each mode we calculate the number\nof \u03c8(2S) decays to each final state (\"signal yield\") NS = S\u03c8(2S) \u2212 B\u03c8(2S) \u2212 Sxf \u2212 fs * Bc\n(where S\u03c8(2S) is the total number of events in the signal region, B\u03c8(2S) events in the scaled\nsidebands, Sxf is the contribution from the cross-feeds, and fs * Bc is the scaled continuum\ncontribution with scaled sidebands subtracted). These yields are shown in Table I. The efficiencies, calculated using a weighted average of results from CLEO III and CLEO-c detector\nsimulations, are also shown.\nWe evaluated the following systematic uncertainties to our measured branching fractions:\n3% uncertainty on the number of \u03c8(2S) decays in our sample; 1% uncertainty in the simulation of our hardware trigger; 1% uncertainty in the reconstruction in each charged track\nin the event; 1% uncertainty for proton identification of tracks coming from the beamspot,\nand 2% for proton and kaon identification of tracks coming from the secondary vertices;\n1% and 2% uncertainties for photon detection and \u03c0 0 reconstruction, respectively; and 1%\nfor background subtraction in \u039b\u039b mode. The detection efficiency also depends upon the\nangular distribution of the hyperons. We find a 10% change in efficiency when we change\nfrom a flat distribution in cos \u03b8 to one of the form 1 + \u03bb cos2 \u03b8 (where \u03bb = 1). The value\nof \u03bb may not be strictly 1 because of effects due to finite charm quark mass [9] and hadron\nmass effect from O(v 2 ) and higher twist corrections to the effective QCD Lagrangian. We\ncompare the detection efficiencies for spin one-half baryon generated samples as discussed\nabove with that obtained by the E835 collaboration [10] and assign the difference, 3.3%, as\nthe systematic uncertainty. We assign a 10% uncertainty in angular distribution to spin 3/2\nbaryons, which covers all reasonable possibilities. The systematic uncertainty in the hyperon\nefficiency was estimated from a comparison of the efficiency of the various requirements in a\ndata and Monte Carlo sample. This is largest for the \u03a3+ and \u039e0 modes where the agreement\nis less satisfactory. In all modes the uncertainty in the reconstruction is doubled as there\nare two hyperons per event.\nTable II displays the breakdown of our systematic uncertainties. The last column tabulates the total systematic uncertainty added in quadrature for each mode.\n5\n\n\f\u221a\nFIG. 2: Scaled energy (Evis / s) distribution for eight \u03c8(2S) decay modes: (a) pp, (b) \u039b\u039b, (c)\n\u03a3+ \u03a3+ , (d) \u03a30 \u03a30 , (e) \u039e\u2212 \u039e\u2212 , (f) \u039e0 \u039e0 , (g) \u039e0 \u039e0 , and (h) \u03a9\u2212 \u03a9\u2212 .

The branching fractions for octet baryons are in the range of 0.02 0.035 %. Our measured branching fractions for hyperon modes are \u223c50% higher than those\nin the PDG [4] which are based on lower statistics (12 and 8 events in the \u039e\u2212 and \u03a30 modes,\nrespectively). We note that isospin partners, \u03a3+ and \u03a30 and also \u039e\u2212 and \u039e0 , have similar\nbranching ratios in agreement with naive expectations. Furthermore, we note that addition\nof strangeness does not greatly change the branching fraction, demonstrating the flavor\nsymmetric nature of gluons. The eighth column in Table I shows the ratio of these \u03c8(2S)\nresults to those from J/\u03c8 measurements [4]. Two of the results follow the 12% rule closely,\nbut two of them differ by approximately a factor of two.\u221aThe last column in Table I shows\nthe background subtracted continuum cross-section at s = 3.67 GeV. We quote upper\nlimits @90CL for the \u039b\u039b, \u039e\u2212 \u039e\u2212 , and \u039e0 \u039e0 production in continuum, owing to marginal\nsignal. A 20% correction (upward) is included to account for the initial state radiation [11].\nIn conclusion, we have analyzed CLEO III and CLEO-c \u03c8(3686) data corresponding to\n3.08\u00d7106 \u03c8(3686) decays. We have presented the first observation of the \u03c8(3686) decaying\nto \u039e0 \u039e0 and \u03a3+ \u03a3+ final states, and give improved (high statistics) branching ratios for the\n\u03c8(3686) decaying to pp, \u039b\u039b, \u039e\u2212 \u039e\u2212 , and \u03a30 \u03a30 modes. We also give new upper limits on\n\u039e\u22170 \u039e\u22170 and \u03a9\u2212 \u03a9\u2212 final states.\nWe gratefully acknowledge the effort of the CESR staff in providing us with excellent\nluminosity and running conditions.
