These fibers consist of two main types\nof protein components: a fibrous component, fibrilen,\nand an amorphous component, the globular elastin protein [1]. The essential elasticity is provided by the latter protein, elastin, which is known to have very unique\nviscoelastic properties in the water swollen state (see\nRefs. [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] for recent overviews). The insoluble elastin is an extensively crosslinked polymer of\na precursor tropoelastin. Tropoelastin is composed of\ntwo types of domains. One of them is rich in lysine\nand provides cross-linking of the individual monomers\nresulting in lysinonorleucin, desmosine and isodesmosine\nlinks, which are responsible for its typical yellow color.\nThe other is made predominantly of hydrophobic amino\nacids with the highly repetitive pentameric repeat unit\n\"VPGVG\" (amino acids V: valine, P: proline, G: glycine)\nwhich has been found to be crucial to elastin's functionality [2, 7, 8, 9].\nAn interesting peculiarity of both elastin and tropoelastin, is that they undergo folding by increasing the\ntemperature beyond typically 25\u25e6 C. The term \"inverse\ntemperature transition\" (ITT) was coined for this apparently paradoxical change from a \"disordered\" (extended)\nto an \"ordered\" (folded) conformation upon heating. A\nstriking manifestation of this phenomena is the ability to\ngrow crystalline solid state structures from a solution of\ncyclic elastin-like oligopeptides by heating [10, 11]. As\n\nsuch, tropoelastin and its synthetic analogues, have been\na subject of intense investigation in the field of biopolymers and protein engineering. Elastin-like polymers have\nthe promise of providing materials for bio-mechanical devices [2, 8, 12] as well as temperature dependent molecular switches [9]. Despite the intense research efforts, the\ndetailed structure of tropoelastin still defeats elucidation.\nHence a molecular level picture which relates the protein\nstructure to the viscoelastic properties is still a matter of\ndebate. What is beyond doubt, however, is the decisive\nrole of water as a plasticizer \u2013 dry elastin is brittle [13].\nStill, the potentially crucial aspect of the protein's hydration water remains largely unexplored with the notable\nexception of recent MD simulations [14].\nThe origin of the viscoelastic properties of elastin is\ncontroversially discussed, calling concepts such as classical rubber elasticity [15], various librational entropy\nmechanism [3, 8, 16], and multi\u2013phase models [4, 14].\nMuch of the experimental data has been summarized in\nexcellent reviews [2, 6, 17] on both elastin and elastin-like\npolypeptides. There is much data that suggest that both\nelastin and its synthetic mimics display an interesting\nconformational dynamics in solution. Early NMR studies suggest that elastin under physiological conditions is\ncomposed of highly mobile chains [18, 19], which correlated well with the observation from birefringence [20]\nmeasurements that elastin, in the same state, is isotropically distributed with the chains adopting random conformations. Studies of the thermo-mechanical properties of water swollen elastin and tropoelastin are consistent with the interpretation of elastin as a classical\n\n\f2\nrubber with heavy emphasis on the role of entropic contributions to elasticity [15]. These findings would support a single phase model where the structure of elastin\nis random and undergoes large amplitude fluctuations.\nRecent single-molecule AFM and spectroscopic measurements [7] studies have severely challenged this interpretation and suggest that, above the ITT temperature, a\nstructurally ordered model of poly(VPGVG) can also account for these elastic properties due to significant protein librational contributions to the overall entropy as\nsuggested two decades ago [21]. Other spectroscopic experiments such as FT-IR, NMR, CD and Raman measurements [9, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26] on elastin-like polypeptides suggest the presence of \u03b2- and \u03b3-turns as a common\nstructural motif which may be in dynamic equilibrium\nand very short and/or distorted antiparallel \u03b2-strands\nand disordered structures with possible dynamic sheetcoil-turn transitions. Recent NMR studies also point\nto the high mobility of the elastin chains in the water\nswollen elastins [27] and in solution multiple temperature states for poly(GVGVP), each with different dynamical behavior and peptide-water interactions, were\nobserved [28]. These later data would rather support a\nmultiphase model of elastin [4] where the fine details of\nthe protein structure and in particular its interactions\nwith water play a crucial role in understanding its elasticity. Overall, there is a wealth of data on the structure\nand properties of these systems, and although the models do not agree on their interpretation, a central ingredient is the intriguing and complex dynamical behavior of\nelastin-like polymers themselves and the crucial interplay\nwith solvating water molecules.\nAtomistic simulations on elastin or elastin-analogues\nare scarce. Early work (see Ref. [3] for a review), such as\nRef. [16], studied the elastic properties of these proteins\nby performing short MD simulations under constraints\nin order to mimic an external pulling force. Here the authors found that entropic forces from reduced librational\nmotion of the protein were indeed a main contributing\nfactor in the elastic behavior. However, the authors were\nunderstandably limited to simulation times not exceeding\none nanosecond. It is noted that, in general, short simulation times generally lead to unreliable statistics, due to\ninsufficient sampling of configuration space, and hence\nmay provide only qualitative insights. A crucial factor\nalso to be considered is the explicit atomistic treatment\nof the protein/water interface and characterization of its\nrole in determining elastin's properties. As a significant\nadvance along these lines, recent studies on solvated 90\namino acid polypeptides of sequence (VPGVG)18 , have\nbeen reported, which explicitly include water [14]. The\nimportance of the protein/water interface was worked out\nbased on thermodynamic and static structural \u2013 as opposed to dynamic \u2013 considerations. This work was successfully able to reproduce the ITT, clarify how water\nmay contribute to the entropic contribution to the elastic forces [29] as well as probe the role of elastin mimics\nas potential molecular machines [30]. Overall this work\n\nwas was successfully able to qualitatively relate its findings to much of the experimentally observed phenomena,\nthough, some debate has arisen with regards to the ability of the proposed structures to account for the temperature dependence of elastin's water content above the\nITT [7]. Despite the significant improvement these simulations have brought to our understanding of the atomic\nlevel details concerning elastins' behavior, these quite\nlong biopolymers were simulated on the order of a few\nnanoseconds for a given temperature. In view of the expected long relaxation times of proteins of that size [31]\nit would be highly desirable to have access to simulation\ntimes that allow for quantitative statistical-mechanical\nanalysis for a given number of amino acids. This is especially true for low frequency oscillations of the protein\nbackbone which play a central role in many models of\nelastin's properties. Furthermore, the dynamics and in\nparticular the kinetics of hydrogen-bonds remains unexplored up to now. Thus, questions regarding the coupling\nof the dynamics of the protein, the protein/water interface and hydrogen bonding remain open issues.\nA significant experimental finding was the recent demonstration [9] that oligopeptides of the kind\nGVG(VPGVG)n display the ITT even in the limit of\nonly one pentameric repeat unit. Using the limiting\nvalue n = 1 opens up the possibility to perform MD\nsimulations that allow for fairly long simulation times\nwith sufficiently many solvating water molecules. We\ntherefore have launched a joint experimental / simulation study of the smallest possible elastin model, the octamer GVG(VPGVG) (having only \u2248 640 Da), see the\npreceding paper [25] and Ref. [24] for a preliminary short\ncommunication. This minimal elastin model was chosen, at the expense of experimental difficulties, in order\nto allow for extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, at 12 temperatures between 280 K\u2013390 K, with\na thorough conformational sampling of 32 nanoseconds\neach (after equilibration), followed by in\u2013depth statistical mechanical analysis with a focus on dynamics. The\ncurrent approach will allow us to obtain a crucial link\nbetween the multitude of experimental results and the\natomistic simulations by directly comparing results obtained on essentially the same system under thermodynamically consistent conditions. Moreover, the detailed\nstatistical mechanical analysis which is possible on the\ncurrent MD simulations will provide a complementary\nperspective on simulation work already existing in the\nliterature.\n\nII.\nA.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nTime evolution and Temperature Dependence\nof Structural Parameters\n\nIn order to get a first impression of the dynamics of\nthe solvated octapeptide GVG(VPGVG) we consider the\ntime evolution of a few selected quantities describing the\n\n\f3\n\n(a)\n\nFIG. 1: Time evolution of selected structural quantities of\nGVG(VPGVG) in water at 330 K: (a) Distance from C\u2013 to\nN\u2013terminus, rC\u2212N , (b) Radius of gyration, rgyr , (c) Radius\nVal\nof gyration of the valine side groups, rgyr\n, (d) Number of\npeptide-peptide HBs, npp , (e) Number of waters bridging two\namino acids of peptide by HBs , nbw , (f) Number of HBs between peptide and solvating water, nps , (g) Projection of the\ntrajectory onto the first eigenvector of the covariance matrix,\nm\u03031 ; see text for definitions. Only for presentation purposes\nthe functions were denoised using the Savitzky-Golay procedure [32] where a time window of 128 ps and a polynomial\nof 6th degree was used, whereas the analysis was carried out\nbased on the original data sets.\n\nFIG. 2: Graphical representation of typical protein conformations at 330 K including only bridging waters. (a) Open\nstate, (b) Closed state.\n\noverall structure. The first parameter of interest is the\ndistance from the C\u2013 to the N\u2013terminus, rC\u2212N , which is\na measure of the extension of this short polymer chain. A\ntypical time evolution profile of this quantity is presented\nin Figure 1(a) at a temperature of 330 K. Judging from\nthis parameter there are two distinctly different types of\npeptide structure: the majority of the time rC\u2212N oscillates about a distance of 17 \u00c5 (corresponding to \"open\nstructures\") while a second, less probable configuration,\nis found when rC\u2212N \u2248 5 \u00c5 (stemming from \"closed structures\"). Representative configurations, as obtained at\n330 K for each type of conformation, are depicted in Figure 2. The presence of two types of peptide conformations is also mirrored by the radius of gyration of the\nbiopolymer, rgyr , which is a standard measure of a polymer's overall size. This parameter is strongly correlated\nwith the end\u2013to\u2013end distance rC\u2212N , see Figure 1(b), such\nthat for the extended structures rgyr \u2248 8 \u00c5 whereas for\nthe closed ones rgyr \u2248 4 \u00c5. As a simple measure of the\nproximity of hydrophobic side groups of the peptide we\nalso consider the radius of gyration of the valine side\nVal\n, see Figure 1(c). Again, this parameter\ngroups only, rgyr\nis found to be strongly, although not perfectly, correlated\nwith the end-to-end distance and, as expected, the radius\nof gyration of the entire peptide.\nThe open and closed structures have distinctly dif-\n\nferent hydrogen bond (HB) arrangements as indicated\nby changes in the numbers of HBs of different classes.\nSpecifically, we consider the number of HBs within the\npeptide that directly connect amino acid donor (NH) and\nacceptor (CO) groups, npp , the number of HBs between\nthe peptide and water molecules in its solvation shell, nps ,\nand the number of water molecules that bridge different parts of the peptide chain by simultaneously forming\nHBs to two or more non-consecutive amino acid residues,\nnbw , see Figure 2. According to Figure 1 these quantities are again found to be strongly correlated to rC\u2212N . In\nthe closed state peptide/peptide HBs and water bridges\nexhibit values of around npp \u2248 2 \u2212 3 and nbw \u2248 2, respectively, whereas peptide/solvation water interactions\namount to about nps \u2248 12 HBs. This is quite different in the extended state: there are few peptide/peptide\nHBs, npp \u2248 0, and bridging waters, nbw \u2248 0, but about\nnps \u2248 16 peptide/solvation water HBs. These simple parameters \u2013 as well as others not depicted here such as\nthe moments of inertia \u2013 indicate several opening and\nclosing events in this trajectory and thus suggest that\nthe present MD simulations are sufficiently able to sample the conformational space available to the peptide to\ndistinguish between two very different types of structure\nwhich are found to be in dynamic equilibrium.\nA similar picture where one observes two types of\nstructures, open and closed, with correlated rC\u2212N , rgyr\n\n(b)\n\n\f4\nand HB types is also found in simulations where the\nthickness of the solvating water sphere is increased as\nwell as with alternate peptide chain capping groups at selected temperatures of 280 and 320 K (see Appendix A 1).\nThis gives us confidence that this scenario is not an aberration of our computational methodology. Moreover, in\nagreement with Ref. [9], this latter finding suggests that\nthe results should depend on only the presence of the\nrepeat unit VPGVG itself. We note in passing that the\ntime scale of the peptide backbone fluctuations which interconvert open and closed conformations is on the order\nof about one nanosecond (see Sect. II B and in particular\nFigure 5(b) for details) even for this minimalistic elastin\nmodel! The implications of this time scale is that for MD\ntrajectories on the order of only a few nanoseconds statistical quantities, which depend on the conformation of\nthe peptide backbone, will be subject to large errors and\nhence should be conservatively interpreted, in particular\nif longer chains, yielding even longer relaxation times, are\ninvestigated.\nWe now consider how this dynamic equilibrium behaves as a function of temperature. Given the above\ndescription of the change in HB configuration as a function of the type of structure, it is convenient to define\nthe number of internal hydrogen bonds, nIHB as the sum\nof npp and the HB arising from the bridging waters, nbw .\nNote that both npp and nbw exist only when the structure is closed. An average over the entire trajectory will\nresult in very small numbers with large associated errors,\nwhereas, nIHB is a more statistically meaningful quantity\ncarrying similar information. The data from the time\naverages < rC\u2212N >, < rgyr >, < nIHB >, < nps >,\nVal\n> are plotted in Figure 3 as a function of\nand < rgyr\ntemperature. As expected from the above correlations\nVal\n< rC\u2212N >, < rgyr >, < nIHB >, and < rgyr\n> display a\nsimilar temperature dependence which may be classified\nin terms of two distinct \"temperature regimes\" below and\nabove a temperature close to 330 K. The average end\u2013\nto\u2013end distance increases slightly from 280 K to 310 K,\nwhere a significant decrease of < rC\u2212N > sets in with\na maximum contraction at 330 K, followed by a rise in\nvalue up to 390 K. Similarly, < nIHB > and < rgyr >\nmirror this trend. The average of the radius of gyration\nVal\nstemming from the valine groups only, < rgyr\n>, shows\nalso an initial decrease, but at variance with the total\nradius of gyration it remains small up to high temperatures subject to sizable fluctuations. Below 330 K the\nstructures have slightly larger rgyr and only a few internal HBs, which is consistent with only a small percentage of closed structures. The largest number of closed\nstructures is observed at 330 K resulting in the smallest\n< rgyr > and the largest < nIHB >. Above this temperature, < rgyr > slowly increases in parallel to a decrease\nin < nIHB >, which is consistent with a decrease in the\nnumber of closed structures. Note in passing that both\n< npp > and < nbw > also follow this same trend, although with much larger numerical noise. Overall, our\npicture not only is consistent with the interpretation of\n\n17\n16\n<rC-N>/\n15\n\u00c5\n14\n13\n280\n\n320\n\nT /K\n\n360\n\n400\n\n360\n\n400\n\n360\n\n400\n\n360\n\n400\n\n360\n\n400\n\n(a)\n6.8\n6.6\n<rgyr>/\n6.4\n\u00c5\n6.2\n6\n280\n\n320\n\nT /K\n\n(b)\n7.6\n7.4\n7.2\nVal\n\n7\n\n\u00c5\n\n6.8\n\n<rgyr >/\n\n6.6\n6.4\n6.2\n280\n\n320\n\nT /K\n\n(c)\n17\n\n<nps>\n\n16\n\n15\n\n14\n280\n\n320\n\nT /K\n\n(d)\n1.6\n\n1.4\n<nIHB>\n1.2\n\n1\n280\n\n320\n\nT /K\n\n(e)\n\nFIG. 3: Average quantities as a function of temperature: (a)\nDistance from C\u2013 to N\u2013terminus, rC\u2212N (circles), (b) Radius\nof gyration, rgyr (squares), (c) Radius of gyration of valine\nVal\nside groups, rgyr\n(triangles down), (d) Number of HBs between peptide and solvating water, nps (triangles up), (e)\nNumber internal HBs, nIHB (diamonds); see text for definitions. Dashed lines are linear connections of the data to guide\nthe eye.\n\nan ITT occurring at around 330 K but we also find a slow\ntrend reversal at higher temperatures.\nAs a measure of how the peptide/water interface behaves during these structural transitions the total number of interfacial HBs, < nps >, is considered, see Figure 3(d). There is a continuous decrease in < nps >\nobserved upon increasing the temperature with a pro-\n\n\f5\nnounced kink at around 330 K. This hints that the\npeptide/water interface also exhibits two temperature\nregimes as already observed for the structural quantities\nassociated with the peptide structure. It is noted, however, that this trend obtained from averaging the structural quantity nps is much less pronounced and is examined in greater detail in Sect. II C by dynamical analysis\nof the peptide/water interfacial HBs.\n\nOverall, these averaged structural quantities provide a\nsuggestive, though by no means comprehensive, picture\nof the atomic level details of the peptide structural transitions. The presence of two types of structures, open and\nclosed, correlates extremely well with the observation of\nan isodichroitic point in the CD spectra [9, 25] and supports the description of this small peptide as behaving\nlike a two-state system. The increase of the contribution\nof closed structures, at temperatures up to 330 K and\nits subsequent decrease at higher temperatures is consistent with the temperature dependence of more compact structures containing \u03b3 and \u03b2 turns as observed in\nthe FT-IR spectra of the complementary experimental\ninvestigation [25]. The DSC and PPC thermodynamic\nmeasurements presented in the joint experimental study\nmay also be interpreted as the peptide ultimately reverting to a structurally and thermodynamically similar state at temperatures near the boiling point of water. In addition, the above scenario is qualitatively in\naccord with that presented in Ref. [14] which describes\nthe ITT using a similar but much longer model peptide.\nSpecifically this study also finds an increasing number\nof peptide/peptide HBs, an overall average contraction\nof the peptide at the ITT, a decreasing number of interfacial water molecules and an increasing number of\nbridging waters which may be thought of as the internal\nwaters in our small elastin-like analogue. The authors\nof Ref. [14] attribute this shrinkage to a \"hydrophobic\ncollapse\" which is in agreement with our observed temVal\nperature dependence of < nps > and < rgyr\n>. However,\nthe current picture suggests the subtle but crucial difference that there is a net exchange of peptide/peptide and\nbridging water intramolecular HBs for peptide/water interfacial HBs; the energetic implications of the various\nHB types are addressed in Sect II C. At this point we\nstress that our finding and its interpretation has a striking resemblance to the recently advanced description of\nself\u2013association of methanol in water [33] whereby the\narrangement of hydrophilic\u2013hydrophilic interactions are\nassumed to determine the structure as opposed to entropic hydrophobic\u2013hydrophilic interactions. In the following two subsections these suggestive findings, which\nare based on simple descriptors, will be further scrutinized by a detailed statistical-mechanical analysis.\n\nB.\n\nPrincipal Component Analysis and Order\nParameter\n\nTo probe the above findings in a systematic but simple\nway one would ideally wish to describe these phenomena\nby a single parameter, i.e. by an order parameter or reaction coordinate. To explore this possibility we have\nemployed what is called covariance, essential dynamics, or principal component analysis (PCA) [34, 35, 36]\n(see Appendix A 3 for a short introduction). In this\napproach one computes, by time averaging, < . . . >,\nover the entire MD trajectory the covariance matrix\nC =< [x(t)\u2212 < x >] * [x(t)\u2212 < x >]T >, where x(t)\nare the Cartesian coordinates of the peptide atoms at\ntime t in a frame of reference where the overall translations and rotations of the polymer have been subtracted.\nThe 3N \u2212 6 normalized eigenvectors {mi } with nonzero\neigenvalues {\u03bbi } provide a basis in which the complex\npolypeptide motion may be decomposed; more technical details are compiled in Appendix A 3. This then\nprovides a theoretical framework which can be though\nof being analogous to harmonic normal modes that are\nof ubiquitous use to explain spectroscopic observations\nof small molecules. In practice this allows us to disentangle relevant peptide backbone folding motions from\nsmall\u2013amplitude vibrations via projecting the deviations\nof the MD trajectories from the average structure onto\nthe eigenvectors, i.e. m\u0303i = [x(t)\u2212 < x >]*mi . Ideally, for\nuncorrelated small\u2013amplitude vibrations the corresponding projections m\u0303i will simply fluctuate about an average value yielding an approximately Gaussian distribution function, P (m\u0303i ); the width might be temperature\u2013\ndependent akin to quasi\u2013harmonic molecular vibrations.\nStrong deviations from such a unimodal behavior would\nsingle out \"interesting modes\" that can be associated to\ncollective changes involving many atoms. Upon changing\nthe temperature the various modes are expected to mix,\nin particular the higher\u2013order modes. Thus, a common\nbasis {mi } has to be chosen to ensure a consistent analysis. In the following, projections {m\u0303i } will be performed\nonto the basis of eigenmodes of the low\u2013temperature trajectory at 280 K.\nUpon projecting the MD trajectories onto the eigenvector with the largest eigenvalue \u03bb1 it is found that this\nmode, m1 , actually describes the opening and closing\nmotion of the octapeptide, and is present at all temperatures, see Figure 4(a) for a graphical illustration. In\nFigure 1(g), we depict this projection m\u03031 as a function\nof time at 330 K where it can be inferred to be perfectly\ncorrelated with the other parameters already discussed\nin the previous section. The octapeptide thus exists in\na closed state m\u03031 \u2248 \u221222 \u00c5 with end\u2013to\u2013end distances\nof about 5 \u00c5 and an extended state m\u03031 \u2248 +5 \u00c5 and\nend\u2013to\u2013end distances of about 17 \u00c5. In addition, the\nprojection process yields for m\u03031 a bimodal distribution\nfunction P (m\u03031 ) at low temperatures, whereas it adopts\na unimodal, but very broad and skewed shape upon heating, see Figure 4(c).\n\n\f6\n\n(a)\n0.06\n0.04\n0.02\n0\n0.04\n0.02\n~ )\nP(m\n0\n1\n0.04\n0.02\n0.0\n0.04\n0.02\n0\n-30\n\n(b)\n\n390 K\n\n360 K\n\n330 K\n\n280 K\n\n-20\n\n-10 ~\n0\nm1/\u00c5\n\n10\n\n20\n\n0.08\n0.04\n0\n0.08\n0.04\n~ )\nP(m\n0\n2\n0.08\n0.04\n0\n0.08\n0.04\n0\n-20\n\n390 K\n\n360 K\n\n330 K\n\n280 K\n\n-10\n\n(c)\n\n10\n\n20\n\n10\n\n20\n\n(d)\n\n30\n\n30\n\n20\n\n20\n\n~ )/\nF(m\n1 -1\nkJ*mol\n10\n\n~ )/\nF(m\n2 -1\nkJ*mol\n10\n\n0\n-30\n\n~ 0/\u00c5\nm\n2\n\n0\n-20\n\n-10 ~\n0\nm1/\u00c5\n\n(e)\n\n10\n\n20\n\n-20\n\n-10\n\n~ 0/\u00c5\nm\n2\n\n(f)\n\nFIG. 4: Results of the Principal Component Analysis: (a)\nVisualization of large amplitude opening and closing mode,\nm1 (b) Visualization of large amplitude librational mode, m2\n(c) Distribution function of the projection m\u03031 at 280, 330, 360\nand 390 K.

For\npresentation purposes the free energy profiles for 330, 380\nand 390 K were shifted in energy by 5, 10 and 15 kJ*mol\u22121 ,\nrespectively.\n\nThe mode with the next largest eigenvalue, m2 , can\nbe classified as a peptide backbone librational mode,\nsee Figure 4(b) for a sketch. During this motion the\npeptide backbone undergoes twisting which is actually\nvery similar in spirit to that described for the deformation of \u03b2\u2013turns in Refs. [2, 14]. However, in contrast to the lowest\u2013order projection m\u03031 , m\u03032 as well as\nall other higher\u2013order mode projections of the peptide\nbackbone are characterized by fairly symmetric, narrow\nand unimodal distributions P (m\u0303i ) that are essentially\ntemperature\u2013independent, see Figure 4(d). This implies\nthat \u2013 as far as the interpretation of the behavior of the\nfolding transitions are concerned \u2013 we are able to neglect\nall backbone librational motions and reduce our considerations down to only a single degree of freedom: m1 .\nThus, we may confidently employ the corresponding projection m\u03031 as a \"natural\" many\u2013body collective reaction\ncoordinate, or order parameter, for investigating the folding transition dynamics of GVG(VPGVG) in water.\nHaving obtained a proper order parameter distribution\n\nfunction, P (m\u03031 ), allows one to readily define an effective\nrelative free energy profile (or \"potential of mean force\")\naccording to \u2206F (m\u03031 ) = \u2212kB T ln[P (m\u03031 )/P (m\u0303ref\n1 )] as a\nfunction of temperature; kB is the Boltzmann constant.\nThe normalizing reference value P (m\u0303ref\n1 ) is chosen such\nthat the arbitrary value at the minimum of the free energy profile is set to zero for convenience, see Figure 4(e).\nAt 280 K, the free energy shows two minima, separated\nby a small barrier, related to both open (broad global\nminimum at m\u03031 \u2248 5 \u00c5) and closed (local minimum at\nm\u03031 \u2248 \u221220 \u00c5) structures with the latter about 3 kJ/mol\nhigher in energy then the former. By 330 K the minimum associated with the closed structure, as well as, the\nbarrier become much lower in relative free energy thus\nthe entire profile of \u2206F broadens out into a flat potential energy landscape. Above 330 K the free energy of\nthe closed minimum gradually increases again and eventually disappears by 370-390 K. Performing an identical\nanalysis for the remaining modes provides approximately\nharmonic potentials of mean force, see Figure 4(f) for the\npotential derived from m\u03032 , in agreement with our use of\nonly m\u03031 as an order parameter. The trend in \u2206F (m\u03031 )\nreflects the presence of the temperature regimes observed\nfrom the average parameters, i.e. increased folding from\n280\u2013320 K, the observation of maximum folded structures around 330 K, and the unfolding at T \u2265 340 K.\nThe presence of two minima in \u2206F (m\u03031 ) in conjunction\nwith the temperature-induced changes naturally explains\nthe existence of the isosbestic and isodichroitic points observed in FT\u2013IR and CD experiments [25], respectively,\nand gives us confidence in the reliability of our simulations.\nAt 330 K, fluctuations and thus statistical errors are\nlarger then at other temperatures due to the broader\nconfiguration space which must be sampled possibly in\nconjunction with slower relaxation. This effect is similar\nto the \"slowing\u2013down problem\" occurring for statistical\nconvergence at second\u2013order phase transitions where all\nquantities, and in particular the order parameter itself,\nundergo large fluctuations. However, the finite system\nsize does not allow for a true phase transition with a\nwell defined transition temperature but rather one observes, in agreement with spectroscopic and thermodynamic measurements [9, 24, 25] the two temperature\nregimes which are bracketed about the temperature of\nmaximal folding, T \u2248 330 K.\nThe dynamical motion of the peptide itself can be analyzed by examining the time-dependence of the reaction\ncoordinate m\u03031 as described by the correlation function\ncm (t) = hm\u03031 (0)m\u03031 (t)i / hm\u03031 (0)m\u03031 (0)i, see Figure 5(a).\nThis time auto-correlation function may be well approximated in the short time limit, t < 100 ps, by an exponential function, cm (t) \u223c exp[\u2212t/\u03c4m ], with an associated\nrelaxation time \u03c4m of the peptide's opening and closing\nmotion. The temperature dependence of this important\ndynamical parameter is depicted in Figure 5(b). For temperatures below 330 K, \u03c4m \u2248 300 \u2212 350 ps is roughly constant within the accuracy of our statistics.

(c) Peptide backbone quasi\u2013harmonic\nentropy, S (down triangles), as a function of temperature; see\ntext for definitions.\n\nthere is a progressive speed-up (\u03c4m \u2248 130 \u2212 150ps) which\nreflects the steepening of the free energy surface in the\nregion of closed structures, i.e. for m\u03031 \u226a 0. From 370\u2013\n390 K, where the free energy surface contains essentially\na single minimum, m\u03031 \u2248 +5, with approximately constant curvature, the relaxation time levels off to a plateau\nvalue of about \u03c4m \u2248 150 ps. Temperature variations of \u03c4m\nthus reflect three dynamical scenarios corresponding to:\nfolding, unfolding and unfolded, which is slightly different from the observations made on the average structural\nquantities. Note, however, that the last of the three temperature regimes represent a limiting case of the unfolding transition where there effectively no longer exists a\nmimimum for closed structures. These findings correlate\nwell with larger peptide backbone fluctuations observed\nin NMR spectroscopy [27] for water swollen elastins. Unfortunately, the most directly comparable NMR measurements of 13 C relaxation times for poly(GVPGV) in solution are only obtained for the temperatures below the\nITT [28]. None the less, the authors report a mean effective correlation time for polymer motion on the order\nof about 500 ps at 298 K in astonishing agreement with\nthe 300 ps time scale reported here at the same temper-\n\nature. These facts suggest that temperature-dependent\nmeasurements of NMR 13 C relaxation times for this small\nsystem may serve as an independent verification of our\nfindings.\nPrevious MD studies on much larger poly(GVPGV)\nchains find qualitatively that the peptide becomes\n\"slightly more dynamic\" or less rigid at higher temperatures [14]. This also matches our quantified speedup of the dynamics of the peptide's backbone opening\nand closing motion. Thus despite the increase in number of peptide/peptide HBs, there must be an overall\nincrease of freedom in the motion of the peptide backbone. The question then arises: does this extra motion\nlead to favorable entropic contribution to the ITT from\nthe peptide? To address this, we consider the entropy\nchange of the peptide backbone motion as estimated\nfrom a quasi-harmonic approximation based on the principal component analysis [37, 38]. Note, this analysis\nis based on a quasi-harmonic approximation [37, 38],\nwhereas the lowest-order mode, m1 , which contributes\nabout 40% to the overall variance of the peptide backbone, is strongly anharmonic and even bimodal at low\ntemperatures. However, its contribution to the total peptide backbone entropy is fairly small with much larger\ncontributions arising from the more harmonic higherorder modes. Figure 5(c) shows the entropy of the peptide in a united\u2013atom representation (see Appendix A 3)\nas a function of temperature. We find that despite the\nvolume contraction of the peptide below 330 K the entropy is increasing with rising temperature, i. e. the entropy of the peptide itself increases upon folding. The\nassociated entropy change is also consistent in magnitude with the experimentally measured entropy increase\nof 0.15 kJmol\u22121 K\u22121 and 0.11 kJmol\u22121 K\u22121 (at 298 K\nand 1 bar) obtained from a van't Hoff analysis of equilibrium constants of both CD and FT\u2013IR data [9, 24, 25].\nThese findings are similar in spirit to various librational\nentropy models employed to explain viscoelastic properties of elastin and its synthetic mimetica [3, 7, 8]. Our\nanalysis does not, however, eliminate the possibility that\nstabilizing entropic terms from the water are also important contributors to the folding behavior. Nevertheless, our simulations clearly demonstrate that our elastin\nmimic is a very dynamical entity and that the thermodynamic consequences of this motion, in particular the\nincreasing entropy, are a key component in understanding its structural transitions.\n\nC.\n\nHydrogen Bond Dynamics and Kinetics\n\nIn order to address the role of water and in particular the influence of hydrogen bonding on the peptide's\nconformational transitions we analyze the dynamics of\nthe HB network. To this end, we employ the intermittent HB auto-correlation function [39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44],\nc(t) = hh(0)h(t)i / hhi. As usual the HB population variable h(t) is defined to be unity, h(t) = 1, if a particular\n\n\f8\nHB exists at time t and zero h(t) = 0 otherwise; the\ncriteria to define a HB are compiled and discussed in\nAppendix A 4 and the average h. . .i is taken over all HBs\nthat were present at time t = 0. This function describes\nthe probability that a HB, which was intact at t = 0, is\nintact at time t independently of possible breakings (and\nreformations) in the interim time. Similar to the average\nnumber of HBs in Sect. II A the following classes were introduced: HBs between water molecules in the bulk cw (t)\n(Figure 6(a)), between first shell protein solvation water\nand bulk water csw (t) (Figure 6(b)), between the peptide\nand first shell solvation water cps (t) (Figure 6(c)), and\ndirect HB contacts of the peptide with itself cpp (t) (Figure 6(d)). These functions provides us with a wealth of\ninsights into the complex dynamics and the associated\ntime scales of the solvated peptide in relation to e.g. relaxation dynamics in bulk water. Comparison of cw (t)\nand cps (t) nicely shows the well known trend [45, 46, 47]\nof slower dynamics for interfacial peptide water HBs then\nthose within bulk water: depending on the temperature\ncw (t) and cps (t) decay to zero between 10-20 ps and 2050 ps, respectively, at temperatures below 330 K. At the\nhighest temperatures both functions decay to zero within\n10 ps with the most pronounced speed-up of this process\noccurring at the peptide/water interface. Conversely, the\nfunction csw (t) decays to zero in only a few picoseconds\nat all temperatures indicating that only fast HB breaking dynamics occurs for this class of bonds. A curiosity\nis the function cpp (t), which instead of decaying to zero\nstill retains a finite value for upwards of 100 ps or more.\nThis behavior arises from the fact that peptide/peptide\nHBs, once broken cannot diffuse away from each other\nas they are formed involving the peptide backbone, i.e.\nthey have a finite probability to reform even after long\nelapsed times due to topology.\nTo extract further information on the processes occurring on these various time scales we make use of a more\nelaborate correlation function [40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 48],\nn(t) = hh(0)[1 \u2212 h(t)]H(t)i / hhi, This function n(t) measures the conditional probability that a HB, which was\nintact at t = 0, is broken at time t > 0 given that the\ndonor / acceptor pair that established the HB at t = 0\nis still close enough at time t > 0 to potentially form\nagain the HB. The function H(t) is unity only if the HB\npair distance is smaller than a cutoff distance of 3.6 \u00c5,\nwhich is the second nearest neighbor shell of the donor /\nacceptor pair radial distribution function. Thus, n(t) allows one to focus on the dynamics for t >\n\u223c 2 ps where\nthe HB dynamics is more complex due to its coupling to\ntranslational diffusive motion [40, 41, 48], whereas the\ntime domain for t <\n\u223c 2 ps is dominated by fast librational\nand possibly vibrational motion of water molecules. This\nfunction plays a significant role for two types of HBs considered in this work: HBs between water molecules in\nthe bulk, nw (t) (Figure 7(a)), and HBs between the peptide and water molecules in its first solvation shell, nps (t)\n(Figure 7(b)). In both cases n(t) increases from t = 0 in\nview of the formation of non-hydrogen bonded pairs re-\n\n390\n370\n350\n330 T / K\n310\n290\n1\n\n5\n10\n15\nt / ps (0,0.05,0.50)\n\n(a)\n\n390\n370\n350\n330 T / K\n310\n290\n1.7\n\n5\n10\n15\nt / ps (0,0.01,0.1)\n\n(b)\n\n390\n370\n350\n330 T / K\n310\n290\n3\n\n25\n50\n75 100\nt / ps (0,0.010,0.1)\n\n(c)\n\n390\n370\n350\n330 T / K\n310\n290\n0\n\n25\n50\n75 100\nt / ps (0,0.061,0.40)\n\n(d)\n\nFIG. 6: Temperature and time dependence of various HB\nauto-correlation functions c(t): HBs between (a) water\nmolecules in the bulk cw , (b) first shell solvation water and\nbulk water csw , (c) the peptide and first shell solvation water\ncps , and (d) direct HB contacts of the peptide with itself cpp ;\nsee text for definitions.

Comparison\nof Figure 7(b)(a) and (b) shows a more rapid decay for\nnw (t) than nps (t), which is due to the slower dynamics\nof HBs at the peptide/water interface.\nFollowing previous studies [40, 41, 48], we formulate a\nrate equation describing the kinetics of HBs as a combination of terms resulting from breaking and reforming\nHBs\n\u2212\n\ndc(t)\n= kc(t) \u2212 k\u0303n(t) ,\ndt\n\n(1)\n\nwhere k is the rate constant of HB breaking and k\u0303 is that\nfor HB reformation subsequent to breaking; note that\n\u03c4 = 1/k defines an average HB lifetime. For bulk water, see Figure 8(a) and Table I, both time constants kw\nand k\u0303w show a simple Arrhenius or classical transition\u2013\nstate\u2013theory behavior, i.e. k = A exp[\u2212E \u2021 /kB T ], at all\n\u2021\n\u2021\ntemperatures (with Ew\n\u2248 7 kJ/mol and \u1ebcw\n\u2248 5 kJ/mol).\nThus, both HB breaking and reformation increase in rate\nconstantly with temperature in the bulk, as expected for a\nsimple thermal process. Note that the bulk water value of\nkw at 300 K is close to data from simulations of pure water at room temperature [40, 41, 44, 48] whereas our value\nof k\u0303w is smaller by a factor of about one half. Although\n\nsome of this discrepancy may arise from systematic errors as discussed in Appendix A 4, it is more likely due\nto the difference in the dynamical properties of TIP3P\nwater from SPC or SPC/E models (see Ref. [49] and references therein) used in previous studies [40, 41, 44, 48].\nIn particular, TIP3P water has a larger diffusion coefficient [49] which allows the water molecules to diffuse\naway at a different rate after an HB breaking event.\nAlthough the bulk water behaves in an expected manner the same cannot be said for HBs that connect the\npeptide to its surrounding water shell. As with the average structural parameters and the peptide backbone relaxation time, both kps and k\u0303ps show two distinct Arrhenius temperature regimes bracketed around 330 K. Below\n\u2021\n320 K the activation energy Eps\n\u2248 12 kJ/mol to break an\ninterfacial HB is higher than that in the bulk, whereas\nabove 330 K it is much lower (\u2248 4 kJ/mol). Concur\u2021\nrently, HB reforming at the interface: \u1ebcps\n\u224811 kJ/mol\nis close to that for breaking, but at 330 K the apparent\n\u2021\nactivation energy (\u1ebcps\n\u2248 0 kJ/mol) vanishes. In terms of\nrates, see Figure 8, both processes to break and reform\nHBs at the peptide/water interface effectively slow down\nupon heating (w.r.t. a linear Arrhenius\u2013extrapolation of\nthe low temperature behavior) once a critical threshold,\nabout 320\u2013330 K, is surmounted. Hence, the rate to make\ninterfacial HBs essentially reaches a plateau value above\n330 K, whereas the one to break these bonds continues\nto grow with temperature, see Figure 8.\nThis observation of a profound change in the dynamics of the peptide/water interface is in qualitative accord with thermodynamic measurements [7, 24, 25]. In\nparticular, the behavior of the thermal expansion coefficient also indicates an overall decrease in the \"strength\"\nof these interactions. This is also consistent with the\nproposed hydrophobic collapse which occurs for the ITT\nof elastins [14]. However, the most intriguing aspect of\nthis observation is that the peptide/water HB dynamics,\nwhich occurs on a time scale of 1-10 ps, mirrors the dynamics of the peptide which occurs on time scales that\nare two orders of magnitude larger.\nWe now investigate the dynamics of the HBs between\ninterfacial water and bulk water as well as those involving the bridging waters. For the latter class a correlation\nfunction cbw (t) is introduced based on a HB population\nfunction hbw (t) which is unity only if a water molecule\nis simultaneously bound to two or more different residues\n\n\f10\n\n1\n0\nlog(k) -1\n-2\n-3\n0.0024\n\n0.0028\n\n0.0032\n-1\n-1\nT /K\n\n0.0036\n\n(a)\n0\n-0.5\n-1\nlog(k)\n-1.5\n-2\n-2.5\n0.0024\n\n0.0028\n\n0.0032\n-1\n-1\nT /K\n\n0.0036\n\n(b)\n-0.2\n-0.4\n-0.6\nlog(kpp)\n-0.8\n-1\n\n0.0024\n\n0.0028\n\n0.0032\n-1\n-1\nT /K\n\n0.0036\n\n(c)\n\nFIG. 8: Arrhenius plot of rate constants for HB breaking, k,\nand reformation, k\u0303, for HBs between (a) first shell protein\nsolvation water and bulk water ksw (down triangles), water\nmolecules in the bulk kw (open up\u2013triangles) and k\u0303w (filled\nup\u2013triangles); (b) the peptide and first shell solvation water\nkps (open diamonds) and k\u0303ps (filled diamonds); (c) the peptide\nwith itself kpp (circles). The symbol size covers the error\nbars and the lines are linear (i.e. Arrhenius) fits; see text for\ndefinitions and Table I for the resulting fit parameters.\n\nof the peptide. For the former of these two HB classes\nthe second term in Eq. (1) may be neglected due to the\nrelatively rapid decay of csw (t) to zero. We find that ksw\nfeatures essentially an Arrhenius behavior at all temper\u2021\natures with a similar value of Esw\n= 7 kJ/mol as bulk\nwater, see Figure 8(a) and Table I. This picture is entirely in accord with the proposition that these surface\nwater molecules have a hindered orientation which strains\nthe HBs that are formed with bulk water. This does not\nallow for HB reformation after breaking, hence the process of fast HB reformation does not occur for this class\nof HBs. More surprising is that the correlation function\nof the bridging waters, cbw (t), essentially decays to zero\nwithin 2 ps at all temperatures (not shown for that reason). For this small peptide it may thus be concluded\nfrom the dynamics that, although water\u2013mediated peptide/peptide bridges (\"internal water\") do occur, they\nplay no key stabilizing role for the folded state. As a\ncorollary for the above assertion of interchange of HBs\nto be at the heart of the folding / unfolding behavior of\nelastin, the stability of the folded state must then come\nfrom the peptide/peptide HBs.\nWe thus turn our focus to the function cpp which de-\n\nscribes the dynamics of the peptide/peptide HBs. Unfortunately, the poor statistics resulting from the few HBs\nthat exist for T < 320 K, and the relatively poor convergence for long-time decay only allow for a partial analysis. Nonetheless, we are able to make several important\nobservations. First, the short-time regime t < 4 ps can\nbe used to obtain an approximation to kpp in a similar\nfashion as above, see Figure 8. Below 330 K, kpp may be\ninterpreted as having approximately Arrhenius behavior\n\u2021\nwith Epp\n\u2248 8 kJ/mol, see Figure 8(c). This barrier is\nsimilar to that for HBs between bulk water but less then\nthose between the peptide and solvent waters; see Table I for a detailed comparison. Above 330 K, where\na larger number of peptide/peptide HBs improves the\nstatistics of cpp (t), kpp is again found to have an approximate Arrhenius behavior. At these temperatures the\npeptide/peptide HBs exhibit a slightly lower activation\n\u2021\nbarrier for breaking of Epp\n\u2248 6 kJ/mol, which is larger\nthan that for peptide/water HBs in the same temperature regime, and will thus stabilize the folded state. The\nincrease of thermal energy which allows peptide/water\nHBs to break more easily decreases the stability of the\nopen state but has less effect on the folded state which\nis in part stabilized by peptide/peptide HBs. Second, although the long time decay of the function has too much\nnumerical noise to provide a reliable fitting it is evident\nthat the probability to recover the same HB pair decreases rapidly with increasing temperature above 330 K,\nsee Figure 6(d). This is in accord with the above observation of a speed-up of the peptide's backbone motion\nin this same temperature regime. Increasing fluctuations\nof the peptide backbone above 330 K result in breaking peptide/peptide bonds more rapidly and decreasing\nthe probability with which they reform. This effect will\ncounter the stabilization from peptide/peptide HBs for\nthe folded state and will eventually lead to the unfolding\nat higher temperature.\n\nIII.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe presented study is successfully able to reproduce\nthe inverse temperature transition of a minimal elastin\nmodel at about 40-50\u25e6C. Additionally, an unfolding transition is identified at temperatures approaching the boiling point of water. Our simulations reproduce the key\nobservations obtained from FT\u2013IR, CD, DSC, and PPC\nexperiments in the companion study [25] of the same water solvated octapeptide. Due to the small size of the\nsystem two broad temperature regimes are found both\nin experiment and in the simulations: the \"ITT regime\"\n(at about 10-50\u25e6C) and the \"unfolding regime\" at about\nT > 60\u25e6 C where the structure has a maximum probability of being folded at T \u2248 50\u25e6 C. A detailed molecular\npicture involving a reaction coordinate and a free energy\nprofile for this process is presented along with a thorough\ntime-correlation function analysis of the hydrogen bond\ndynamics and kinetics within the peptide as well as at the\n\n\f11\npeptide/water interface. In particular, the two regimes\nare characterized by changes in a dynamical two-state\nequilibrium between open and closed conformations and\na change of the HB dynamics involving interfacial water\nmolecules.\nIn a nutshell, our data suggest a simple qualitative picture of the observed transitions. At low temperatures,\na relatively strong peptide/water interaction stabilizes\nopen conformations relative to closed ones. The increase\nof thermal energy however decreases the stability of the\nextended state but has less effect on the folded conformation which is in part stabilized by peptide/peptide HBs.\nThus, there is a shift in equilibrium and one observes an\nincrease in folded structures and hence the ITT. A second\nimportant contributing factor is the increase of peptide\nbackbone fluctuations above the ITT and the resulting\nentropic stability. However, the large librational amplitude motion of the peptide backbone can provide sufficient thermal excitation to break these peptide/peptide\nHBs at higher temperatures which ultimately leads to a\nsecond, unfolding, transition.\nThe current work, based upon a temperature scan using 32 ns simulations of an octapeptide, gives further\nsupport to the conclusions of previous studies employing\nmuch shorter MD simulations on longer poly(VPGVG)\npeptides [14, 17, 29, 30]. As in these studies we also observe a decrease in the peptide/water interactions around\nthe ITT and a speed-up of the peptide backbone dynamics above this transition. Although our longer simulation\ntimes do qualitatively agree with the findings of this earlier work the present study is able to provide a more quantitative analysis of the dynamical processes associated\nwith the peptide structural transitions. Novel findings related to the inter-relation of of peptide/water HB dynamics and peptide librational entropy, which are complementary aspects of the ITT and unfolding transitions as\nopposed to being alternate models, are only possible due\nto these quite long MD trajectories. Thus, the current\nwork emphasizes the importance of detailed statisticalmechanical analysis in constructing atomic level pictures\nof complex biomolecular processes.\nThe limitation of the current approach however, is that\nit is not at present clear how all of the factors, which have\nbeen isolated as key ingredients in the peptide structural\ntransitions, will apply to large polypeptides. Although it\nis highly likely that decrease in peptide/water HB interactions and peptide librational entropy will remain important ingredients the relative weights of the two factors\nin larger polymers is unknown. Most notably,the energetic/entropic contribution of bridging waters in larger\npolymers where the folded peptide may be truly said to\nhave an \"inside\" is currently an open issue. To address\nthese questions, future combined experimental and theoretical work on GVG(VPGVG)n with n = 2 and 3 including mutant structures as well as tropoelastins is currently\nunderway.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work has benefitted immensely from insightful\nand enjoyable interactions with: Amalendu Chandra,\nAlfons Geiger, Helmut Grubm\u00fcller, Matthias M\u00fcller,\nChiara Nicolini, Nikolaj Otte, Hermann Weing\u00e4rtner,\nRoland Winter, and Xiao\u2013Ying Yu.

In accordance with the experimental finding [9] that VPGVG is the minimal repeat\nunit necessary for observing the ITT irrespective of the\nend groups, the caps are not expected to change the basic scenario as found in our complementary experimental\nstudy on the zwitter ionic species [24, 25]; further checks\nare discussed below. The octapeptide is solvated with\n2127 waters and its center of mass is fixed to the center of a 50 \u00c5 diameter spherical droplet surrounded by\nstochastic boundary conditions [50]. This sphere diameter allows us to maintain at least three to four molecules\nbetween the peptide and the stochastic boundary even for\nthe configurations where elastin is at its maximum elongation of about 27 \u00c5. We employ the all atom Charmm\nforce field [51] for the peptide and the TIP3P [52] water\npotential.\n\n2.\n\nSimulations\n\nWithin the EGO molecular dynamics package [53, 54]\na weak Berendsen thermostatting scheme (coupling time\nconstant of 100 fs) was used to control the temperature\nusing a 1 fs MD time step and the Shake algorithm\nfor fixing the bonds between hydrogen and heavy atoms.\nThis conservative choice of parameters for a careful integration of the equations of motion has allowed us to\nperform stable simulations which included equilibration\ntimes of 2\u20135 ns (depending on temperature) prior to obtaining 32 ns trajectories at 12 temperatures between 280\nand 390 K. An additional run was performed at 400 K\n(not shown) in order to stretch the temperature range\nas much as possible beyond the boiling point of water.\nFor many properties, such as HB breaking and reformation rate constants, the same trend as obtained from\n\"extrapolation\" of the data from 340 to 390 K was observed. However, in particular average structural parameters showed deviations from this trend which we interpret tentatively as failures of the simulation approach.\n\n\f12\nNote that 400 K exceeds by about 100 K the temperature range for which the employed force fields for both\nwater and the peptide are optimized, i.e. ambient conditions. As a convergence check an additional 8 ns run\nwas obtained at 280 K in order to test the reliability of\nboth average and dynamical properties of the protein;\nthe results at 280 K are quoted for the 32 ns MD run\nfor statistical consistency. Internal pressures inside the\ndroplet were found to be less than about 0.1\u20130.2 kbar\ndepending on the temperature, which is well below the\npressure of the order of many kbars that is required to\nsuppress protein folding entirely [25, 55].\nIn order to cross\u2013check the possible influence of the\ncapping groups we have computed two 25 ns trajectories\nat 280 and 320 K in larger droplets (60 \u00c5 diameter with\n3700 water molecules) for both the capped and zwitterionic peptides. We obtained qualitatively identical results\nto those presented here indicating that the ITT is not significantly affected by the presence of the caps, which is in\nline with experimental findings [9], nor by the spherical\nboundary conditions for the chosen size of the solvating\ndroplet.\n3.\n\nPrinciple component analysis\n\nPrincipal component analysis (PCA) is a standard projection method in statistical data analysis, feature extraction, and data compression [36]. Given a set of multivariate data, the purpose is to find a smaller set of variables\nwith less redundancy reproducing the original data as\nwell as possible. The redundancy is measured by correlations between the data elements.\nThe starting point in PCA is a random vector x with\nn elements and a sample x(1) , . . ., x(L) from this vector.\nNo assumptions on a generative model or the probability\ndensity of the vectors are made as long as the first- and\nsecond-order statistics can be estimated from the sample.\nFirst of all the vector x is centered\nx \u2190 x\u2212 < x >\n\n(A1)\n\nand the mean < x > is estimated from the available\nsample. Geometrically this transformation corresponds\nto a translation of the entire sample so that the mean is\nnow at the origin. Next consider a linear combination\nm\u03031 =\n\nn\nX\n\nw1k xk =\n\nw1T x\n\n,\n\n(A2)\n\nk=1\n\nwhere the index goes over all elements of x. The\nweights w11 ,. . . , w1k are real numbers, elements of an ndimensional vector w1 and w1T denotes the transpose of\nw1 . The factor m\u03031 is called the first principal component\nof x, if the variance of m\u03031 is maximally large. Therefore\none has to maximize the second moment\n< m\u030321 >=< (w1T x)2 >= w1T < xxT > w1 = w1T Cx w1\n(A3)\n\nsubject to the normalization condition\n|w1 | = (w1T w1 )1/2 = 1 ,\n\n(A4)\n\nwhere | * * * | denotes the euclidian norm\n|w1 | = (w1T w1 )1/2\n\n(A5)\n\nof w1 and Cx is the n \u00d7 n covariance matrix of x. The\nmaximization problem can be rewritten\n(Cx \u2212 \u03bbI)w1 = 0\n\n(A6)\n\ndet(Cx \u2212 \u03bbI) = 0\n\n(A7)\n\nor\n\nwhich means that \u03bb is an eigenvalue of Cx and that w1\nis the corresponding eigenvector\nw1 = m 1 .\n\n(A8)\n\nTherefore the first principal component is a projection\nof the vector x onto the unit length eigenvector of it's\ncovariance matrix having the largest variance, i.e. eigenvalue.\nThis solution can be generalized to n principal components where the i-th principal component is\nm\u0303i =\n\nn\nX\n\nmik xk = mTi x\n\n(A9)\n\nk=1\n\nwith 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n and the eigenvectors are ordered in\ndescending order of the magnitude of their eigenvalues\n\u03bb1 > \u03bb2 > * * * > \u03bbn . Thus the original data set can be\nfully reproduced by the expansion\nn\nX\n\nm\u0303i mi =\n\ni=1\n\nn\nX\n\nmTi x mi .\n\n(A10)\n\ni=1\n\nThe hope is now that by considering just the first few\nprincipal components most of the data can be represented\nas\nx=\n\nn\nX\ni=1\n\nm\u0303i mi \u2248\n\nj<n\nX\n\nm\u0303i mi = xapprox\n\ni.e. xapprox \u2248 x .\n\ni=1\n\n(A11)\nIn the case of analyzing MD trajectories the variable x\ncan be an 3N -dimensional vector consisting of the cartesian coordinates of the N atoms under consideration in\nthe form\nx = (x1 , y1 , z1 , x2 , y2 , z2 , * * * , xN , yN , zN )\n\n(A12)\n\nand the sample x(1) , . . ., x(L) is given by a MD trajectory\nof finite length L, see e.g. Refs. [34, 35]. Before performing the PCA itself the data set must be corrected for overall translation and rotation. After centering according to\nEq. A1 the overall rotation of the considered system is\n\n\f13\nsubtracted. This can be done by rotating each configuration to a reference configuration by a least squares fit [56].\nThis translation-rotation correction will thus provide six\neigenvalues equal to zero, which do not refer to the purely\ninternal motion.\nSince the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix are mutually orthogonal, i.e. uncorrelated, the motions in the\ndirection of each component, i.e. along the corresponding\neigenvector, can be interpreted as a \"mode\". To visualize\nthe motion of each mode one has to calculate the coordinates including the mean of x and the fluctuations of\nthe positions described by the principal component under\nconsideration\n(l)\n\n(l)\n\nxi = m\u0303i mi + < x >\n\n(A13)\n\nwhere the index i denotes the i-th principal component\nand l the l-th timestep of the trajectory of total length\nL. Note that this yields a \"caricature\" of an important\ndynamical motif hidden in the full dynamics [34].\nFor the PCA carried out here, all heavy atoms of the\npeptide backbone were included. In addition, a united\u2013\natom representation was introduced for each side chain\nby assigning a mass equivalent to that of all its constituting atoms which was located at its center of mass.\nThis procedure effectively reduces the number of atoms\nto N = 38 and thus simplifies the analysis and its representation. In line with previous findings [57] it was\nconfirmed that this approximation does not lead to any\nsignificant alteration of the results. Tests indicate that\nPCA including all atoms provides an essentially identical picture for the low\u2013order modes that are of interest.\nThe dependence of the resulting motions upon trajectory\nlength was carefully evaluated and results were found to\nbe well converged for simulations on the order of 20 ns\nin duration. For example, the dot product between the\nslowest motion, i.e. {m1 } computed over two distinct\n20 ns trajectories and that from a 30-40 ns trajectory at\nthe lowest temperature, 280 K, is about 0.98 therefore\nindicating that the modes are essentially converged. Finally, the modes discussed in this investigation are found\nto exist also when using the zwitterionic octapeptide and\nin the simulations with a larger solvation sphere around\nthe peptide as discussed in Appendix A 2.\n4.\n\nHydrogen Bond Analysis\n\nConcerning the definition of HBs in water, and thus\nthe population variable h(t), we employ a standard structural criterion based on both the distance (ROH < 2.6 \u00c5\nas obtained from including the entire first nearest neighbor peak in the intermolecular OH radial distribution\nfunction) and the angle, 6 O\u2212H***O > 130\u25e6 for h(t) =\n1 [39, 40, 41, 42, 44, 48]. As a check we also performed\nthe analysis with only the distance criterion and yet again\nwith the distance criterion but using a tighter angular\ncriterion of 6 O\u2212H***O > 150\u25e6. Consistent with previous\nfindings [42, 44] the absolute value of rate constants, kw\n\nand k\u0303w , is sensitive to the actual choice of the parameters of the definition and was found to vary as much as a\nfactor of 2-3 between different definitions. However, we\nalways obtained the same qualitative trends that both\nHB numbers and rate constants (kw and k\u0303w ) feature a\nlinear behavior with respect to temperature. Similarly,\nfor peptide/peptide and peptide/water HBs the same criterion based on distances (RAH < 2.6 \u00c5 where the proton\nacceptor A is either an O atom of a water molecule or of\na peptide carbonyl group) and angles (6 D\u2212H***A > 130\u25e6\nwith the proton donor D being either water O or peptide backbone N) was used. As a check we varied the\ndistance to RAH < 2.4 \u00c5 keeping the angle cutoff unaltered and performed the analysis with only the distance\ncriterion. Again we found the same general behavior of\ntwo temperature regimes based on the dynamics of peptide/water HBs and the temperature dependence of npp\nand nbw to be preserved. In conclusion, although the\nHB definitions do change the reported absolute values of\nthe HB numbers and rate constants as expected [42, 44],\nthe qualitative behaviour remains the same and thus the\ntrends in the temperature dependence for these quantities are not affected.\n\n\f14\n\n[1] Pasquali-Ronchetti, I., Fornieri, C., Baccarani-Contri,\nM., & Quaglino, D.
