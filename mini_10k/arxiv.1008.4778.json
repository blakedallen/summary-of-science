In principle, it was verified experimentally in 1958 by\nSparnaay [2], although conclusive measurements had to wait until the end of the 20th century\n[3\u20135]. Even more sensational was Boyer's 1969 [6] calculation for the Casimir energy of\na perfectly conducting spherical shell, which produced a repulsive force, rather than the\nattractive force that Casimir had postulated earlier [7] for a model of the electron. Since\nthen, the question of how the sign and magnitude of the Casimir energy depend on the\ngeometry of the system has been a constant leitmotif in Casimir energy studies.\nIn this paper, we attempt to elucidate this question by calculating the Casimir energies for\nthe interiors of infinitely long cylinders of various cross sections. Such calculations have long\nbeen available for waveguides of rectangular [8, 9] and circular [10, 11] cross sections, but\nit apparently was not widely appreciated that energies for certain triangular cross sections\nwere equally well calculable. We will work with triangular (equilateral, hemiequilateral,\nand isosceles right triangles), square, and rectangular cross sections. The triangular and\nrectangular cylinders are ideal since their eigenvalues are known explicitly. We obtain results\nin a very efficient form extremely amenable to numerical evaluation by use of the ChowlaSelberg formula [12\u201314], which is far more rapidly convergent than the direct evaluation\nof Epstein zeta functions. Even better, we are able to obtain closed-form results for the\ninterior Casimir energies by use of a convenient representation found by many authors [15\u2013\n22]. These powerful methods supersede the previous method of directly summing the Epstein\nzeta function. With the obtained data, we can then relate Casimir energies for these cross\nsections with their distinguishing geometrical properties, notably the perimeter P and the\ncross-sectional area A. Our chief result is the discovery that there appears to be universal\nfunctional dependence for the Casimir energy per length multiplied by the area, EA, due\nto the interior fluctuations inside an infinitely long waveguide, in terms of a dimensionless\nquantity expressing the waveguide's cross-sectional attributes, A/P 2 . This universality class\napplies to figures based on regular polygons; for a rectangle, for example, of sides a and b a\ndifferent dependence obtains, which changes sign, as expected, when the rectangle becomes\nsufficiently elongated.\n2\n\n\fIt is interesting to note that the square and circular waveguides have been extensively\nstudied [8\u201311, 23\u201327], in contrast to the triangular case which has only partially been examined. As far as the authors can tell, this paper is the first with explicit numerical results\nfor the interior Casimir energy for infinitely long waveguides of triangular cross sections.\nEarlier work has, however, been done on plane equilateral triangular geometries [28]. For\nother work on equilateral triangular domains see Refs. [20\u201322, 29, 30]. There has been recent\nwork in which explicit eigenvalues for the equilateral triangle have been used in computing\nnumerical values for a piston of such a cross section [31].\nProbably the reason why these Casimir energies were never evaluated, although the explicit eigenvalues appear in textbooks [32, 33], is that most authors considered interior\ncalculations suspect. It is, of course, not possible by these methods to extract exterior\neigenvalues or the corresponding Casimir energies. For smooth surfaces, such as a circular\ncylinder, only the sum of the interior and exterior Casimir energies of an infinitesimally thin\nboundary shell can be calculated unambiguously. In the language of heat kernels, the a2\nheat kernel coefficient is proportional to the cube of the curvature, and cancels only when\nboth interior and exterior modes are included. When a2 6= 0 and only the interior is considered, there is a logarithmic divergence that cannot be removed, leaving an ambiguous\nCasimir energy. But, for polygonal boundaries, there is no such coefficient, and the interior\nCasimir energies seem well defined. There are divergences associated with the corners, but\nthey do not contribute to the global Casimir energy of the waveguide, because they may\nbe unambiguously subtracted off. For a review of the state of the art for self-energies of\nsmoothly bounded regions, see Ref. [34]\nThe outline of this paper is as follows. In Sec. II we formulate Casimir energies in terms\nof mode summations, which we regulate either by dimensional continuation or by a temporal\npoint-splitting cutoff. The former approach leads naturally to the use of the Chowla-Selberg\nformula, while the latter produces an expression that is summed through use of the Poisson summation formula; either approach can lead to a result that can, in special cases, be\nexpressed in closed form. These machineries are applied to cylinders with equilateral triangular cross sections in Sec. III, for both Dirichlet and Neumann scalar modes, and hence\nfor interior electromagnetic modes for a perfectly conducting boundary. The same is done\nin Sec. IV for a bisected equilateral triangular cross section, that is, a hemiequilateral or\n30\u25e6 -60\u25e6-90\u25e6 triangle. A square cylinder is reconsidered in Sec. V, as is a rectangular cylinder\n3\n\n\fin Sec. VI. The bisection of a square waveguide, one formed by a right isosceles triangle,\nis treated in Sec. VII. General right triangular cross sections are considered numerically in\nSec. VIII, showing that a finite Casimir energy is obtained even when the eigenvalues are not\nexplicitly available. All the energies for triangular Dirichlet boundaries found in this paper\nlie on a universal curve, which smoothly joins the proximity force approximation. Why the\ninterior modes of a continuous curved cross section, such as that of a circle, cannot yield a\nfinite Casimir energy is discussed in Sec. IX. The corner divergences are reflected only in\nthe a1 heat-kernel coefficient, unlike the curvature divergences which show up also in the\na2 coefficient. Again, unlike for continuously curved figures in a plane, Casimir energies for\nsquares and equilateral triangles, and figures obtained from these by bisection, are likewise\nunambiguously calculable, and given in Sec. X, along with numerical results for right triangles. Results for the cylindrical geometries considered are summarized in the Conclusions in\nSec. XI. The Appendix sketches the derivation of the Chowla-Selberg summation formula\nfrom the Abel-Plana formula.\n\nII.\n\nCASIMIR ENERGY OF A CYLINDER\nA.\n\nMode summation\n\nThe Casimir energy per length, E, for infinite cylindrical geometries can generally be\nexpressed as a sum over mode frequencies in the following form,\nZ\n1 \u221e dk Xp 2\n2\nk + \u03b3mn\n,\nE=\n2 \u2212\u221e 2\u03c0 m,n\n\n(2.1)\n\n2\n2\nwhere \u03b3mn\nare the eigenvalues of the two-dimensional Laplacian, (\u22072\u22a5 + \u03b3mn\n) \u03a6mn (r\u22a5 ) = 0,\n\nsubject to \u03a6mn (r\u22a5 ) satisfying appropriate boundary conditions on the cylinder's surface.\nHere, r\u22a5 denotes the two coordinates transverse to the longitudinal cylinder axis. For\n2\ncases where the eigenvalues have explicit formulas, \u03b3mn\nis a quadratic function of the mode\n\nnumbers m and n.\nThe form of this quadratic function depends on the geometry, and the range of the mode\nnumbers depends on the boundary conditions being applied. In the subsequent sections, we\nwill look at the cases of Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. The electromagnetic\ncase can be obtained from these two classes of modes. Because of the cylindrical geometry,\n4\n\n\fthe modes of the electromagnetic field in a perfectly conducting waveguide can be expressed\nin terms of two scalar fields satisfying separately Dirichlet (E or TM modes) and Neumann\nboundary conditions (H or TE modes) [32, 33]. It follows then that the Casimir energy for\nan electromagnetic field is simply the sum of the Casimir energies for the E and H modes.\n(This breaks down if the boundaries are imperfect, for example, for a general dielectric\ncylinder [35].)\nThe expression above for the energy is formally divergent and as usual requires a regularization technique in order to obtain physically interpretable results. Out of the many ways\nto regularize such an expression, we choose the methods of dimensional regularization and\npoint-splitting regularization.\n\nB.\n1.\n\nRegularization methods\nDimensional regularization\n\nBy extending the one dimension for the longitudinal wavevector k to d dimensions, dk \u2192\n\ndd k, we obtain the following expression for the energy per length,\n\u0393(\u2212(1 + d)/2) X 2 \u0001(1+d)/2\n\u03b3mn\n.\nE = \u2212 lim d+2 (d+1)/2\nd\u21921 2\n\u03c0\nm,n\n\n(2.2)\n\nIn the limit d \u2192 1, we obtain a \u0393(\u22121) divergence. However, one can surmount this problem\nby analytic continuation. For the cases considered in this paper, the eigenvalue expression\n2\n\u03b3mn\nis a simple quadratic form in m and n. This allows us to employ the Chowla-Selberg for-\n\nmula, an exact formula for a class of Epstein zeta functions [12, 13], proved in the Appendix,\nand thereby utilize the reflection property of the zeta function,\n\u0393(s)\u03b6(2s) = \u0393((1 \u2212 2s)/2)\u03b6(1 \u2212 2s)\u03c0 2s\u22121/2 ,\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhich allows us to continue to d \u2192 1. The technique of dimensional regularization is our\nmethod of choice throughout this paper since the Chowla-Selberg formula converges exponentially faster than the Epstein zeta functions obtained by the point-splitting regularization\nwe present below.\nIn fact, it has been known for many years that we can sum the zeta function into a\nform [15\u201321] that can yield a closed-form expression for the Casimir energy in the cases of\na square, isosceles right triangle, equilateral right triangle, and a 30\u25e6 -60\u25e6-90\u25e6 triangle.\n5\n\n\f2.\n\nPoint-splitting regularization (Cutoff )\n\nA more physical approach is to start from the general form for the quantum vacuum\nenergy in terms of the Green's function for a given frequency \u03c9,\nZ\nZ\n1\nd\u03c9 2\nE=\n(dr)\n2\u03c9 G(r, r),\n2i\n2\u03c0\nwhich for the situation of a cylindrical waveguide, gives the energy per length\nZ\nZ\ndk X\n1\n1 \u221e d\u03b6\n2\nei\u03b6\u03c4 ,\n2(\u2212\u03b6 )\nE=\n2\n2\n2\n2 \u2212\u221e 2\u03c0\n2\u03c0 m,n \u03b6 + k + \u03b3mn\n\n(2.4)\n\n(2.5)\n\nwhere in the second line we have made a Euclidean rotation, \u03c9 \u2192 i\u03b6, as well as introduced\n\na time-splitting regulator, t \u2212 t\u2032 \u2192 i\u03c4 , where we are to take \u03c4 to zero at the end of the\ncalculation. Assuming \u03c4 > 0, we do the \u03b6 integration by closing it in the upper half plane,\nwith the result\n\u221a\nX Z \u221e dk p\n1\n2\n2 e\u2212\u03c4 k 2 +\u03b3mn\nE = lim\nk 2 + \u03b3mn\n2 \u03c4 \u21920 m,n \u2212\u221e 2\u03c0\n\u0013Z \u221e\n\u0012\nd\n1\ndk X \u2212\u03c4 \u221ak2 +\u03b3mn\n2\ne\n.\nlim \u2212\n=\n\u03c4\n\u21920\n2\nd\u03c4\n\u2212\u221e 2\u03c0 m,n\n\n(2.6)\n\nJust as the dimensional regularization method was paired with the analytic continuation\nof the exponent, followed by use of the Chowla-Selberg formula, the cutoff regularization\nmethod is combined with Poisson's sum formula. After rearranging the summations to span\n\u2212\u221e to +\u221e, the summation is converted by Fourier transformation from one involving pow-\n\ners of e\u2212\u03c4 to powers of e\u22121/\u03c4 . The final expression after simplifications is similar to the\nChowla-Selberg result except for a slowly converging double sum. As noted above, in fact,\nthat double sum can in special cases be summed into an explicit closed form; both regularizations give the same answer and thus serve as somewhat independent consistency checks.\nIn addition, the cutoff regularization, unlike the dimensional-zeta-function regularization,\nexhibits the explicit divergences. We are then able to identify a \"volume\" and a \"surface\"\ndivergence, as well as a divergent term independent of the scale of the cross section. All of\nthese divergent terms can be regarded as contact terms, and, therefore, may be discarded.\nCorner divergences occur only in the constant term.\n\n6\n\n\fFIG. 1: Equilateral triangle of side a and height h =\n\nIII.\n\n\u221a\n\n3a/2.\n\nEQUILATERAL CYLINDER\n\nWe consider an infinitely long cylinder of equilateral triangular cross section with side\nlength a and height h, as shown in Fig. 1. The eigenvalues of the Laplacian on an equilateral\ntriangular surface with Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions (solved by G. Lam\u00e9 [36])\n2\nare of the form \u03b3mnp\n=\n\n2\u03c0 2\n(m2 + n2 + p2 ),\n3h2\n\nwhere m+ n+ p = 0 [32, 33]. Using this constraint,\n\nthe previous expression can be simplified resulting in\n2\n\u03b3mn\n=\n\n4\u03c0 2 2\n(m + m n + n2 ).\n3h2\n\n(3.1)\n\nHere, m and n are positive or negative integers; their allowed values depend on the boundary\nconditions, as indicated below. The eigenfunctions (which are given in Refs. [32, 33]) have\ndegeneracy under cyclic or anticylic permutations of the three indices m, n, p, so a factor\nof 1/6 must be inserted before the mode sum. One would, indeed, expect only two mode\nnumbers as it is a two-dimensional surface; however, the earlier form is more useful for\ncounting degeneracies.\n\nA.\n\nDirichlet boundary\n\nDirichlet boundary conditions require the fields to vanish on the boundary C, \u03a6(r\u22a5 )|C =\n0. The mode numbers are now restricted to m 6= 0, n 6= 0, and p 6= 0. If any index\nvanishes, the corresponding eigenfunction would likewise vanish. One can then use Eq. (2.1)\nwith Eq. (3.1), and perform the appropriate sum over m and n to obtain the Casimir energy.\nThe dimensionally regulated expression (2.2) may be evaluated by using the Chowla-Selberg\n\n7\n\n\fformula, for Re s > 1:\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n2\n\n2 \u2212s\n\n(am + bmn + cn )\n\nm,n=\u2212\u221e\n\n\u221a\n22s \u03c0as\u22121\n= 2a \u03b6(2s) +\n\u03b6(2s \u2212 1)\u0393(s \u2212 1/2)\n\u0393(s)\u2206s\u22121/2\n\u2212s\n\n\u221e\n\nX\n\u221a\n2s+5/2 \u03c0 s\ns\u22121/2\n\u221a\nn\n\u03c3\n(n)\ncos(n\u03c0b/a)K\n(n\u03c0\n\u2206/a).\n+\n1\u22122s\n1/2\u2212s\n\u0393(s)\u2206s/2\u22121/4 a n=1\n\n(3.2)\n\nHowever, it is valid only when the discriminant \u2206 = 4ac \u2212 b2 > 0.

Hence, taking an equilateral\n12\n\n\ftriangle of side length a and height h we obtain a hemiequilateral triangle of height h and\nside lengths a and a/2. This relation between the two triangles proves very useful in realizing\nthat the hemiequilateral modes are a subset of the equilateral modes [32]. (The proof that\nthere are no additional modes is given in that reference.) Therefore, one simply has to select\nthe equilateral modes that satisfy chosen boundary conditions on the bisector. It is implied\nthat the eigenvalues are of the same form as the equilateral triangle's, Eq. (3.1).\n\nA.\n\nDirichlet boundary\n\nTo satisfy Dirichlet boundary conditions for the hemiequilateral triangle, the eigenmodes\nmust vanish on all three sides of the hemiequilateral triangle. The Dirichlet modes for the\nequilateral triangle already satisfy that condition on two sides, so we are to select the ones\nthat vanish on the bisector. After a few manipulations, the Casimir energy for the Dirichlet\nhemiequilateral triangle is related to the equilateral Dirichlet result with the formula,\n(D)\n\n(D)\nE369\n\nEEq\n\u03b6(3)\n0.0567229\n+\n=\n,\n=\n2\n2\n8\u03c0h\nh2\n\n(4.1)\n\na positive energy again.\n\nB.\n\nNeumann boundary\n\nSimilarly, the Neumann modes for the hemiequilateral triangle have to be chosen from the\nNeumann equilateral modes such that their normal derivative on the bisector vanishes. With\nthis new restriction on the mode numbers, the relation between Neumann hemiequilateral\nand equilateral Casimir energies is established,\n(N )\n\n(N )\nE369\n\nEEq\n\u03b6(3)\n0.0708193\n=\n\u2212\n=\u2212\n,\n2\n2\n8\u03c0h\nh2\n\n(4.2)\n\nwhich is again negative.\n\nC.\n\nEM perfectly conducting boundary\n\nStraightforwardly, we obtain the electromagnetic Casimir energy in the interior of an\ninfinitely long cylinder of hemiequilateral triangular cross section by adding the E and H\n13\n\n\fFIG. 3: Square of side a.\n\nmodes,\n(EM)\n\nE369\n\n1 (EM)\n0.0140964\n(D)\n(N )\n= E369 + E369 = EEq = \u2212\n,\n2\nh2\n\n(4.3)\n\nwhich is, remarkably, exactly one-half that of the energy of equilateral triangle, as might\nhave been anticipated naively.\n\nV.\n\nSQUARE CYLINDER\n\nFor completeness, we consider a square of side length a, as illustrated in Fig. 3. Of course,\nthis is the geometry originally considered by Lukosz [8], and by Ambj\u00f8rn and Wolfram [9].\n2\nThe form for the eigenvalues is \u03b3mn\n=\n\n\u03c02\n(m2\na2\n\n+ n2 ) [32, 33]. It is of a simpler quadratic\n\nform than the previous two geometries, which makes the counting of degeneracies somewhat\nsimpler.\n\nA.\n\nDirichlet boundary\n\nThe Dirichlet modes for the square must vanish on all four sides, and so are products of\ntwo sine functions, a classic result in most electricity and magnetism books. The eigenvalues\nmust therefore both be positive, m > 0 and n > 0. With the appropriate summation range\nand dimensional regularization, we obtain a result consistent with that found in Refs.

Indeed, the Dirichlet Casimir energy vanishes for b/a = 1.74437,\nand is negative for larger values of b/a. See Fig. 9 below. Note that for a general rectangle,\na 6= b, a closed-form expression for the energy is apparently not achievable [19].\nThe corresponding Neumann result is simply\n\u0012\n\u0010 a \u00112 \u0013 \u03b6(3)\n(N )\n(D)\n,\nERect = ERect \u2212 1 +\nb\n16\u03c0a2\n\n(6.2)\n\nwhich again shows from Eq.

Bisecting a square produces an isosceles\n16\n\n\fright triangle, as seen in Fig. 4. The eigenmodes of the isosceles right triangle are a subset\nof the square eigenmodes satisfying the extra condition that they obey given boundary\nconditions on the corresponding square's diagonal. The eigenfrequencies are therefore of the\n2\nsame form as the square's, \u03b3mn\n=\n\nA.\n\n\u03c02\n(m2\na2\n\n+ n2 ), with different ranges for m and n [32, 33].\n\nDirichlet boundary\n\nDirichlet boundary conditions on the isosceles right triangle translate into the constraint\nm > n, and n \u2265 1. Just as in previous cases, the result follows seamlessly.

Of course, away from the special\nvalues \u03b8 = \u03c0/6, \u03c0/4, or \u03c0/3, it is not possible to obtain explicit expressions for the triangle\neigenfrequencies \u03b3n . Instead, we may employ the efficient scaling method introduced by\nVergini and Saraceno [37] and further developed by Barnett [38] to obtain numerically all\nDirichlet eigenfrequencies \u03b3n for a given triangle with high accuracy, up to some desired\nmaximum frequency \u03b3max . The sum over eigenfrequencies is then evaluated numerically\nusing point-splitting regularization as in Eq. (2.6),\nZ\n\u221a2 2\n1 \u221e dk X p 2\nEnum (\u03c4 ) =\nk + \u03b3n2 e\u2212\u03c4 k +\u03b3n ,\n2 \u2212\u221e 2\u03c0 \u03b3 <\u03b3\nn\n\n(8.1)\n\nmax\n\nwhere the error associated with terminating the sum at \u03b3max is proportional to e\u2212\u03c4 \u03b3max , and\nthus we must consider \u03c4 \u03b3max \u226b 1.\nTo extract a physical Casimir energy at small \u03c4 , we must first subtract off the known\ndivergences associated with the first three terms in the Weyl expansion for the spectral\ndensity, associated with the area, perimeter, and corners of the triangular cross section,\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\nZ\n\u221a\nC\nP\nA\u03b3\n1 \u221e dk \u03b3max p 2\n2\n2\nd\u03b3 k + \u03b3 2 e\u2212\u03c4 k +\u03b3\n+\n\u2212\n,\n(8.2)\nEdiv (\u03c4 ) =\n2 \u2212\u221e 2\u03c0 0\n2\u03c0\n4\u03c0\n48\u03c0\u03c4 2\nwhere for the right triangle A =\nis given by Eq.

(3.14).\nWe notice that even after subtracting the divergent terms, the limit \u03c4 \u2192 0 may not\nbe taken numerically due to the constraint \u03c4 \u03b3max \u226b 1, imposed by the fact that we have\nincluded only a finite part of the eigenfrequency spectrum. Instead we fix \u03b3max and fit\nEnum (\u03c4 ) \u2212 Ediv (\u03c4 ) = E + z1 \u03c4 + z2 \u03c4 2 ln \u03c4 + z3 \u03c4 2 + * * * ,\n\n(8.3)\n\n\u22121\nover a range \u03c4 \u2208 [\u03c41 , \u03c42 ], where \u03b3max\n\u226a \u03c41 < \u03c42 \u226a a, and where on the right hand side\n\nof Eq. (8.3) we have listed all non-divergent terms that may appear for a generic cavity,\nthrough order \u03c4 2 . The finite term E is the Casimir energy per unit length for the cylindrical\nwaveguide of chosen cross section.\nFor the numerical results shown in Fig. 5, we have set a = 1, \u03b3max = 400, \u03c41 = 0.05,\nand \u03c42 = 0.2. With these parameters, the numerical approach reproduces exact results for\nthe hemiequilateral and right isosceles triangles to better than 1%.

These are plotted as a function of the dimensionless ratio\nof the area A to the square of the perimeter P , A/P 2 . The points shown are for the 30\u25e6 -60\u25e6 90\u25e6 triangle, the isosceles right triangle, the equilateral triangle, the square, and the circle (which\nincludes interior and exterior contributions), as well as other right triangles evaluated numerically.\nThe curve is the PFA approximation, which should become exact when one of the angles of the\ntriangle goes to zero.\n\nDirichlet boundary conditions, but may be applied to arbitrary cavities in any dimension,\nprovided that a reliable method of numerically evaluating the spectrum is available. A very\nsimilar approach was used in Ref. [39] to evaluate the vacuum energy in quantum graphs\nwhere no explicit solution is available.\nThe graph shows the comparison of the exact and numerical data to the proximity force\napproximation (PFA) for the triangles, in which the energy is computed as though each\nopposite element of a right triangle, with the acute angle \u03b8 \u2192 0, has the interaction energy\ngiven by that for parallel plates. This gives the formula\n\u0012 \u0013\u22122\nA\n\u03c02\n.\nEA =\n368640 P 2\nThis result closely matches the numerical data for very acute triangles.\n\n19\n\n(8.4)\n\n\fIX.\n\nCIRCULAR CYLINDER AND DIVERGENCES\n\nWe have considered cylinders of polygonal shapes in this paper; we believe that we have\ncovered all cases in which the eigenvalues can be explicitly given.1 Furthermore, we have\ngiven numerical results for Dirichlet boundary conditions for a variety of right triangles. It\nwould, of course, be of great interest to consider general polygons, in particular regular polygons, but that is not possible analytically with the exception of the equilateral triangle and\nthe square. (For example, only some of the eigenmodes of a hexagon are known.) Instead,\none may use the method described in Sec. VIII to obtain good numerical approximations\nfor polygons of arbitrary shape.\nOf course, there are well-known analytic results for circular cylinders [10, 11, 27, 40].\nIn these cases, however, both interior and exterior contributions to the cylindrical shell are\nincluded, which is necessary, because otherwise a finite energy cannot be calculated. Put\nanother way, the a2 heat kernel coefficient proportional to the cube of the curvature cancels\nonly when interior and exterior modes are included [41, 42]. If a2 6= 0, the Casimir energy\ncannot be unambiguously computed, because an arbitrary logarithmic scale will add to it.\nWhy does this problem not arise here, where it is impossible to compute the exterior\nmodes? Let us consider the heat kernel for the square, where the mode sum is especially\nsimple. The heat kernel, which lies at the root of the analytic approach followed here, is\nexpressed in terms of the operator H = \u2212\u22072\n\u2212Ht\n\nK(t) = Tr e\n\n=\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u221e\n\u221e\ndk X \u2212(k2 +\u03b3mn\n1 1 X \u2212\u03b3mn\n2 )t\n2 t\ne\n= \u221a\ne\n.\n2\u03c0 m,n=1\n2 \u03c0t m,n=1\n\n(9.1)\n\nThe Poisson summation formula (3.9) converts the latter sum into a form suitable for small\nt expansion:\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u2212tm2\n\ne\n\nm=1\n\n1 1\n=\u2212 +\n2 2\n\nr\n\n\u03c0\n+\nt\n\nr\n\n\u221e\n\u03c0 X \u2212\u03c02 p2 /t\ne\n.\nt p=1\n\n(9.2)\n\nThe latter sum represents exponentially small corrections as t \u2192 0+, so by squaring this,\nwe get the heat-kernel expansion\nK(t) \u223c\n1\n\na\n1\na2\n\u221a\n,\n\u2212\n+\n8\u03c0 3/2 t3/2 4\u03c0t 8 \u03c0t\n\nWe believe that the analysis in Ref. [29] is in error.\n\n20\n\n(9.3)\n\n\fwhere the omitted terms are exponentially small. The three nonzero heat kernel coefficients,\nof course, are proportional to the area, the perimeter, and a constant (this is the generalized\nWeyl theorem):\na0 =\n\nA\n,\n8\u03c0 3/2\n\na1/2 = \u2212\n\nP\n,\n16\u03c0\n\n1\na1 = \u221a .\n8 \u03c0\n\n(9.4)\n\nThere is no a2 coefficient. Carrying out the same calculation for the equilateral triangular\n\u221a\nwaveguide, we obtain the same result except that a1 = 1/(6 \u03c0). These heat kernel coefficients reflect the divergences found in the energy, Eq. (3.14), as explained in Ref. [42].\nSomewhat mysteriously, the corner divergences, which are physically present, appear in the\nheat-kernel machinery only in the a1 coefficient, and not in the a2 coefficient. Because the\nsurfaces are flat, there are no curvature divergences as are present in the circular case. In\ngeneral, the corner angles \u03b1i appear in the coefficient a1 as\n\u0012\n\u0013\nC\n\u03b1i\n1 X \u03c0\na1 = \u221a = \u221a\n\u2212\n.\n48 \u03c0\n48 \u03c0 i\n\u03b1i\n\u03c0\n\n(9.5)\n\nSee Eq. (3.15) and Refs. [43\u201345]. Thus, the same remarks apply to the other polygonal\nshapes considered here. For a regular N-polygonal cross section,\na1 =\n\n1 N \u22121\n\u221a\n,\n12 \u03c0 N \u2212 2\n\n(9.6)\n\n\u221a\nwhich reduces to the expected result for a circle, 1/(12 \u03c0), as N \u2192 \u221e.\nX.\n\nPLANE FIGURES\n\nPerhaps it is even more surprising that finite values are obtained for Casimir energies for\npolygons in a plane, since the corresponding results for a circle are divergent, even when\ninterior and exterior contributions are included [46, 47]. Indeed, Ambj\u00f8rn and Wolfram gave\nCasimir energies for rectangles in a plane [9].\nThe d = 0 version of the Casimir energy (2.2) is of course\nE=\n\n1X\n\u03b3mn ,\n2 m,n\n\n(10.1)\n\nwhich may be immediately evaluated for the four figures considered in this paper via the\nChowla-Selberg formula, or from the Dirichlet L-series formulae.

In both the E and H mode, the results follow a smooth curve\nfor all four polygonal cross sections. Even the circle seems to follow the same pattern for the\nE modes, but deviates significantly for H modes, which is hardly surprising since exterior\nphysics is included for the circular boundary. We would speculate that if Casimir energies\nfor other regular polygonal cross sections could be evaluated numerically, they would lie on\nthis universal curve. As we have seen, for the E or Dirichlet modes, the numerical results\nfor arbitrary right triangles lie on the same universal curve, which closely approaches that\nexpected from the proximity force approximation for small angles.\nOf course, not all cross sections will do so, as illustrated in Fig. 9.

It is easy to show that\nS=2\n\n\u221e X\n\u221e\nX\n\nf (m, n) + 2\n\n\u221e\n\u221e X\nX\n\nm=1 n=0\n\nm=1 n=0\n\nf (m, \u2212n) \u2212 2a\u2212s \u03b6(2s) + 2c\u2212s \u03b6(2s).\n\n(A4)\n\nWe apply the Abel-Plana formula to the two sums in Eq. (A4), with the result\nS = 2c\u2212s \u03b6(2s) + II + III,\nwhere\nII = 2\n\n\u221e Z\nX\n\nm=1\n\nand\nIII = 2i\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\n\u221e\n0\n\ndn [f (m, n) + f (m, \u2212n)] ,\n\n\u221e\nX\n1\n{f (m, it) \u2212 f (m, \u2212it) + f (m, \u2212it) \u2212 f (m, it)} ,\ndt 2\u03c0t\ne \u2212 1 m=1\n\n(A5)\n\n(A6a)\n\n(A6b)\n\nwhere the different terms have branch points in the 2nd, 3rd, 1st, and 4th quadrants, respectively.\nIt is rather easy to evaluate the integral II in terms of the integral\n\u221a\nZ \u221e\n\u03c0\u0393(s \u2212 1/2)\n2\n\u2212s\n.\ndt(t + 1) =\n2\u0393(s)\n0\n\n(A7)\n\nThe end-point contributions cancel, with the result\nII =\n\n\u221a 22s cs\u22121\n\u0393(s \u2212 1/2)\n\u03c0 s\u22121/2 \u03b6(2s \u2212 1)\n,\n\u2206\n\u0393(s)\n26\n\n(A8)\n\n\fwhere \u2206 = 4ac \u2212 b2 .\nThe final integral III is evaluated by shifting the contour by an imaginary amount (the\nshifts along the imaginary axis vanish) and encircling the branch point, so that we obtain\n\u221a !1\u22122s\nZ \u221e\n\u221e\n\u221e\n\u221a\nX\nX\n\u0001\n\u2206\n1\u22122s\n\u2212s\nIII = 2i\n(\u22122)\nm\ndu e\u03c0is \u2212 e\u2212i\u03c0s (u2 \u2212 1)\u2212s e\u2212\u03c0 \u2206up/c\nc\n2c\n1\nm=1\nk=1\n\u0001\n\u2212imkb\u03c0/c\nimkb\u03c0/c\n\u00d7 e\n+e\n\u221e\n1/4\u2212s/2\n\u221a\n\u2206\n1 X\n= 2s+5/2 \u03c0 s \u221a\ncos(\u03c0bp/c)ps\u22121/2 \u03c31\u22122s (p)Ks\u22121/2 (\u03c0p \u2206/c),\n(A9)\nc \u0393(s) p=1\nwhich uses the representation of the modified Bessel function,\n\u221a\nZ \u221e\n\u03c0(z/2)\u03bd\nK\u03bd (z) =\ndt (t2 \u2212 1)\u03bd\u22121/2 e\u2212zt .\n\u0393(\u03bd + 1/2) 1\n\n(A10)\n\nUsing Eqs.
