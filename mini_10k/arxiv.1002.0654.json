Nuclei in this region are very different in collectivity and clustering features than the stable counterpart in the nuclear chart.\nFor example, the neutron magicity is lost for the N=8 nucleus\nfor 12 Be [1] and N=20 for 32 Mg [2]. The discovery of large\ncollectivity of 34 Mg by Iwasaki et al. [3] is another example of\nsuch properties. The deformed structures and core excitations\nof Mg and neighboring nuclei and location of drip-line in this\nmass region is an important matter [4]. On the other hand, the\nappearance of N=16 magic number for 24 O is well established\n[5]. The discovery of the two isotopes 40 Mg and 42 Al, once\npredicted to be drip-line nuclei [6, 7] gives indication that the\nneutron drip-line is located towards the heavier mass region.\nThe existence of neutron halo in 11 Li is well established and\nthe possibility of proton halo in 8 B and the neutron halo in\n14\nBe and 17 B are very interesting phenomena for the drip-line\nnuclei. In addition to these above exciting properties, the cluster structure of entire light mass nuclei and the skin formation\nin neutron-drip nuclei provide us features for the study of light\nmass drip-line nuclei. Also, the exotic neutron drip-line nuclei\nplay a role in many astrophysical studies. In this paper, our\naim is to study the neutron drip-line for Ne-S isotopic chain\nin the frame-work of a relativistic mean field (RMF) and nonrelativistic Skyrme Hartree-Fock formalism and analyse the\nlarge deformation of these isotopes.\nThe paper is organised as follows: The relativistic and nonrelativistic mean field formalisms are described very briefly\nin Section II. The results obtained from the relativistic mean\nfield (RMF) and Skyrme-Hartree-Fock (SHF) formalisms, and\na discussion of these results, are presented in Section III. Finally summary and concluding remarks are given in Section\nIV.\n\nthe nuclei near the proton and neutron drip-lines. We use here\ntwo of the successful mean field models [8, 10\u201316] (Skyrme\nHartree-Fock and the Relativistic Mean Field ) to learn about\nthe properties of drip-line nuclei N e \u2212 S.\n\nA.\n\nThere are many known parametrizations of Skyrme interaction which reproduce the experimental data for ground-state\nproperties of finite nuclei and for the observables of infinite\nnuclear matter at saturation densities, giving more or less\ncomparable agreements with the experimental or expected\nempirical data. The general form of the Skyrme effective interaction, used in the mean-field models, can be expressed as\na density functional H [10, 11], given as a function of some\nempirical parameters, as\nH = K + H0 + H3 + Hef f + * * *\n\nMean field methods have been widely used in the study of\nbinding energies and other properties of nuclei [8, 9]. Although the older version of the SHF and RMF models have\nsome limitation to reproduce some of the observables, the recent formalisms are quite efficient to predict the bulk properties of nuclei not only near the stability valley, but also for\n\n(1)\n\nwhere K is the kinetic energy term, H0 the zero range, H3\nthe density dependent and Hef f the effective-mass dependent terms, which are relevant for calculating the properties\nof nuclear matter. These are functions of 9 parameters ti , xi\n(i = 0, 1, 2, 3) and \u03b7, and are given as\n\u0003\n1 \u0002\n(2)\nt0 (2 + x0 )\u03c12 \u2212 (2x0 + 1)(\u03c12p + \u03c12n ) ,\n4\n\u0002\n\u0003\n1\n=\nt3 \u03c1\u03b7 (2 + x3 )\u03c12 \u2212 (2x3 + 1)(\u03c12p + \u03c12n ) , (3)\n24\n1\n=\n[t1 (2 + x1 ) + t2 (2 + x2 )] \u03c4 \u03c1\n8\n1\n+ [t2 (2x2 + 1) \u2212 t1 (2x1 + 1)] (\u03c4p \u03c1p + \u03c4n \u03c1n ).\n8\n(4)\n\nH0 =\nH3\nHef f\n\nII.

The subscripts n and p refer to neutron and\nproton, respectively, and m is the nucleon mass. The J~q = 0,\nq = n or p, for spin-saturated nuclei, i.e., for nuclei with major oscillator shells completely filled. The total binding energy\n(BE) of a nucleus is the integral of the density functional H.\nAt least eighty-seven parametrizations of the Skyrme interaction are published since 1972 [12] where b4 = b\u20324 = W0 , we\nhave used here the Skyrme SkI4 set with b4 6= b\u20324 [13]. This\nparameter set is designed for considerations of proper spinorbit interaction in finite nuclei, related to the isotope shifts\nin Pb region and is better suited for the study of exotic nuclei. Several more recent Skyrme parameters such as SLy110, SkX, SkI5 and SkI6 are obtained by fitting the HartreeFock (HF) results with experimental data for nuclei starting\nfrom the valley of stability to neutron and proton drip-lines\n[10, 13, 14, 17].\n\n3\n\u22121/3\n).\n4 (41A\n\nThe constant gap BCS pairing is used to add the\npairing effects for the open shell nuclei. It is to be noted that\nin the present work only intrinsic state solutions are presented.\nEach of these deformed intrinsic states is a superposition of\nvarious angular momenta states. To obtain the good angular momentum states and spectroscopic predictions for these\nnuclei near neutron drip-line we need to project out states of\ngood angular momenta. Such calculation will be considered\nas a future extension of this work. The quadrupole moment\ndeformation parameter \u03b22 is evaluated from the resulting proton\nq and neutron quadrupole moments, as Q = Qn + Qp =\n16\u03c0 3\n2\n5 ( 4\u03c0 AR \u03b22 ).\n\nThe root mean square (rms) matter raR\n\u03c1(r\u22a5 , z)r2 d\u03c4 ; here A is the\nthe deformed density. The total binding energy and other observables are also obtained by\nusing the standard relations, given in [16]. We use the well\nknown NL3 parameter set [18]. This set not only reproduces\nthe properties of stable nuclei but also well predicts for those\nfar from the \u03b2-stability valley. Also, the isoscalar monopole\nenergy agrees excellently with the experimental values for different regions of the Periodic Table. The measured superdeformed minimum in 194 Hg is 6.02 MeV above the ground\nstate, whereas in RMF calculation with NL3 set, this number is 5.99 MeV [18]. All these facts give us confidence to\nuse this older, though very much still in use, NL3 set for the\npresent investigation.\n\n1\n2\ndius is defined as hrm\ni = A\nmass number, and \u03c1(r\u22a5 , z) is\n\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nB. The Relativistic Mean Field (RMF) Method\n\nThe relativistic mean field approach is well-known and the\ntheory is well documented [15, 16]. Here we start with the relativistic Lagrangian density for a nucleon-meson many-body\nsystem, as\n1\n1\nL = \u03c8i {i\u03b3 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u2212 M }\u03c8i + \u2202 \u03bc \u03c3\u2202\u03bc \u03c3 \u2212 m2\u03c3 \u03c3 2\n2\n2\n1\n1\n1\n\u2212 g2 \u03c3 3 \u2212 g3 \u03c3 4 \u2212 gs \u03c8i \u03c8i \u03c3 \u2212 \u03a9\u03bc\u03bd \u03a9\u03bc\u03bd\n3\n4\n4\n1\n1\n+ m2w V \u03bc V\u03bc + c3 (V\u03bc V \u03bc )2 \u2212 gw \u03c8 i \u03b3 \u03bc \u03c8i V\u03bc\n2\n4\n1 ~ \u03bc\u03bd ~\n1\n~ \u03bc .R\n~ \u03bc \u2212 g\u03c1 \u03c8 i \u03b3 \u03bc~\u03c4 \u03c8i .R~\u03bc\n\u2212 B\n.B\u03bc\u03bd + m2\u03c1 R\n4\n2\n1\n(1 \u2212 \u03c43i )\n\u2212 F \u03bc\u03bd F\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 e\u03c8i \u03b3 \u03bc\n\u03c8i A\u03bc .\n(7)\n4\n2\nAll the quantities have their usual well known meanings.\nFrom the relativistic Lagrangian we obtain the field equations\nfor the nucleons and mesons. These equations are solved\nby expanding the upper and lower components of the Dirac\nspinors and the boson fields in an axially deformed harmonic\noscillator basis with an initial deformation. The set of coupled\nequations is solved numerically by a self-consistent iteration\nmethod.\nThe centre-of-mass motion energy correction is estimated by the usual harmonic oscillator formula Ec.m. =\n\nA. Ground state properties from the SHF and RMF models\n\nThere exists a number of parameter sets for the standard\nSHF and RMF Hamiltonians and Lagrangians. In some of our\nprevious papers and of other authors [16, 18\u201321] the ground\nstate properties, like the binding energies (BE), quadrupole\nmoment deformation parameters \u03b22 , charge radii (rc ) and\nother bulk properties are evaluated by using the various nonrelativistic and relativistic parameter sets. It is found that,\nmore or less, most of the recent parameters reproduce well\nthe ground state properties, not only of stable normal nuclei\nbut also of exotic nuclei which are away from the valley of\nbeta-stability. So, if one uses a reasonably acceptable parameter set the prediction of the results will remain nearly force\nindependent. This is valid both for SHF and RMF formalisms.\nHowever, with a careful inspection of these parametrizations,\nsome of the SHF and RMF sets can not reproduce the empirical data. In this context we can cite the deviation of isotopic\nshifts than the experimental data [22] for Pb nuclei while using SHF forces like, SkM* values [23]. However, the RMF\nsets reproduce the kink quite nicely [24]. On the other hand,\nmost of the RMF sets over estimate the nuclear matter incompressibility. In general, the predictive power of both the formalisms are reasonably well and can be comparable to each\nother, which can be seen in the subsequent subsections. In addition to this, the general results SHF (SkI4) and RMF (NL3)\nforces are similar for the considered region. Thus in the sub-\n\n\f3\nTABLE I: The calculated ground state binding energy obtained from\nSHF and RMF theory are compared with the experimentally known\nheaviest isotope for Ne, Na, Mg, Al, Si and S [25].\nnucleus RMF SHF Expt. nucleus RMF SHF Expt.\n30\nNe 215.1 210.6 211.2 33 Na 237.9 234.5 232.8\n34\nMg 257.7 255.1 256.2 39 Al 285.2 281.9 283.1\n41\nSi 310.1 305.1 306.6 45 S 353.5 350.2 354.2\n\nTABLE II: The predicted neutron drip-line for Ne, Na, Mg, Al, Si\nand S in RMF (NL3) and SHF (SKI4) parameter sets are compared\nwith prediction of infinite nuclear matter (INM) mass model [26],\nfinite range droplet model (FRDM) [27] and experimental data [25]\nalong with the number shown in parenthesis are the experimentally\nextrapolated values.\nnucleus RMF SHF INM FRDM Expt.\nNe\n34 34 36\n32 30 (34)\nNa\n40 37 40\n36 33 (37)\nMg\n40 40 46\n40 34 (40)\nAl\n48 48 48\n45 39 (42)\nSi\n54 48 50\n48 41 (44)\nS\n55 55 53\n50 45 (49)\n\nsequent results during our discussion we will refer the results\nof RMF (NL3) calculations, except some specific cases. Thus\nthe result of SHF (SkI4) are not displayed in Tables.\n\nB. Binding energy and neutron drip-line\n\nThe ground state binding energy (BE) are calculated for Ne,\nNa, Mg, Al, Si and S isotopes near the neutron drip-line. This\nis done by comparing the prolate, oblate and spherical solution of binding energy for a particular nucleus. For a given nucleus, the maximum binding energy corresponds to the ground\nstate and other solutions are obtained as various excited intrinsic states. In Table I, the ground state binding energy for the\nheaviest isotopes for the nuclei discussed are compared with\nthe experimental data [25]. From the Table it is observed that\nthe calculated binding energies are comparable with SHF and\nRMF results. We have listed the neutron drip-lines in Table\nII, which are obtained from the ground state binding energy\nfor neutron rich Ne, Na, Mg, Al, Si and S nuclei. The nuclei with the largest neutron numbers so far experimentally\ndetected in an isotopic chain till date, known as experimental\nneutron drip-line are also displayed in this Table for comparison. The numbers given in the parenthesis are the experimentally extrapolated values[25]. To get a qualitative understanding of the prediction of neutron drip-line, we have compared\nour results with the infinite nuclear matter (INM) [26] and finite range droplet model (FRDM) [27] mass estimation. From\nthe table, it is clear that all the predictions for neutron drip-line\nare comparable to each other.\nThe drip-lines are very important after discovery of the two\nisotopes 40 Mg and 42 Al [6] that here once predicted to be beyond the drip-line [7, 28]. This suggests that the drip-line is\nsomewhere in the heavier side of the mass prediction which\nare beyond the scope of the present mass models [7, 28].

and 42 Al\nare well within the prediction both in the SHF and RMF formalisms. Again a further comparison of the drip-line with\nRMF and SHF prediction, we find the drip-line predictions in\nboth calculations are well comparable, except for a few exceptions in Na and Si as shown in Table II.\n\nC. Neutron configuration\n\nAnalysing the neutron configuration for these exotic nuclei,\nwe notice that, for lighter isotopes of Ne, Na, Mg, Al, Si\nand S the oscillator shell Nosc = 3 is empty. However, the\nNosc = 3 shell gets occupied gradually with increase of neutron number. In case of Na, Nosc = 3 starts filling up at 33 Na\nwith quadrupole moment deformation parameter \u03b22 = 0.356\nand \u22120.179 with occupied orbits [330]1/2\u2212 and [303]7/2\u2212,\nrespectively. The filling of Nosc = 3 goes on increasing\nfor Na with neutron number and it is [330]1/2\u2212, [310]1/2\u2212,\n[321]3/2\u2212 and [312]5/2\u2212 at \u03b22 = 0.472 for 39 Na.

Quadrupole deformation\n\nThe ground and low-lying excited state deformation systematics for some of the representative nuclei for Ne, Na,\nMg, Al, Si and S are analysed. In Fig. 1, the ground state\nquadrupole deformation parameter \u03b22 is shown as a function\nof mass number for Ne, Na, Mg, Al, Si and S. The \u03b22 value\ngoes on increasing with mass number for Ne, Na and Mg\nisotopes near the drip-line. The calculated quadrupole deformation parameter \u03b22 for 34 Mg is 0.59 which compares well\nwith the recent experimental measurement of Iwasaki et al [3]\n(\u03b22 = 0.58 \u00b1 6). Note that this superdeformed states in 3.2\nMeV above than the ground band. Again, the magnitude of\n\u03b22 for the drip-line nuclei reduces with neutron number N and\nagain increases. A region of maximum deformation is found\nfor almost all the nuclei as shown in the figure. It so happens\nin cases like, Ne, Na, Mg and Al that the isotopes are maximum deformed which may be comparabled to superdeformed\nnear the drip-line. For Si isotopes, in general, we find oblate\nsolution in the ground configurations. In many of the cases,\nthe low-lying superdeformed configuration are clearly visible\nand some of them are available in the Tables.\n\nE. Shape coexistence\n\nOne of the most interesting phenomena in nuclear structure\nphysics is the shape coexistence [29\u201331]. In many of the cases\nfor the nuclei considered here near the drip-line isotopes, the\nground state configuration accompanies a low-lying excited\nstate. In few cases, it so happens that these two solutions\nare almost degenerate. That means we predict almost similar\nbinding energy for two different configurations. For example,\nin the RMF calculation, the ground state binding energy of\n24\nNe is 189.093 MeV with \u03b22 = \u22120.259 and the binding energy of the excited low-lying configuration at \u03b22 = 0.278 is\n188.914 MeV. The difference in BE of these two solutions is\nonly 0.179 MeV.

This phenomenon is clearly available in most of the isotopes near the drip-line. To show it in\na more quantitative way, we have plotted the prolate-oblate\nbinding energy difference in Figure 2. The left hand side of\nthe figure is for relativistic and the right side is the nonrelativistic SkI4 results. From the figure, it is clear that an island\nof shape coexistence isotopes are available for Mg and Si isotopes. These shape coexistence solutions are predicted taking\ninto account the intrinsic binding energy. However the actual\nquantitative energy difference of ground and excited configuration can be given by performing the angular momentum\nprojection, which is be an interesting problem for future.\n\nF. Two neutron separation energy and new magic number\n\nThe appearance of new and the disappearance of known\nmagic number near the neutron drip-line is a well discussed\ntopic currently in nuclear structure physics [5, 32]. Some of\nthe calculations in recent past predicted the disappearance of\nthe known magic number N=28 for the drip-line isotopes of\nMg and S [33, 34]. However, magic number 20 retains its\n\nmagic properties even for the drip-line region. In one of our\nearlier publications, [35] we analysed the spherical shell gap\nat N=28 in 44 S and its neighboring 40 Mg and 42 Si using NLSH [22] and TM2 parameter sets [36]. The spherical shell\ngap at N=28 in 44 S was found to be intact for the TM2 and\nis broken for NL-SH parametrization. Here, we plot the twoneutron separation energy S2n of Ne, Mg, Si and S for the\neven-even nuclei near the drip-line (fig 3). The known magic\nnumber N=28 is noticed to be absent in 44 S. On the other hand\nthe appearance of steep 2n-separation energy at N=34 both in\nRMF and SHF calculation looks quite prominent, and this is\njust two units ahead than the experimental shell closure N=32\n[37].\n\nG.\n\nSuperdeformation and Low \u03a9 parity doublets\n\nThe deformation-driving m = 1/2\u2212orbits come down in\nenergy in superdeformed solutions from the shell above, in\ncontrast to the normal deformed solutions. The occurrence of\napproximate 1/2+ 1/2\u2212 parity dobulets (degeneracy of |m|\u03c0 =\n1/2+ 1/2\u2212 states) for the superdeformed solutions are clearly\nseen in Figs. 4 and 5 where excited superdeformed configurations for 32 Mg and 34 Mg and for 46 Al and 47 Al are given.\nFor each nucleus we have compared the normal deformed\n(\u03b22 \u223c 0.1 \u2212 0.3) and the superdeformed configurations and\nanalysed the deformed orbits.\nThe 1/2+ and 1/2\u2212 states for the single particle levels are\nshown in Fig. 4 (for 32 Mg and 34 Mg). From the analysis\nof the results of this calculation, we have found a systematic\nbehaviour of the low \u03a9 (particularly 1/2+ and 1/2\u2212 ) prolate\ndeformed orbits for the superdeformed solutions.

In general, we find\nlarge deformed solutions for the neutron-drip nuclei which\nagree well with the experimental measurement. We have done\nthe calculation using the nonrelativistic Hartree-Fock formalism with Skyrme interaction SkI4. Both the relativistic and\nnon-relativistic results were found comparable to each other\nfor the considered mass region. In the present calculations\na large number of low-lying intrinsic superdeformed excited\nstates are observed for many of the isotopes and some of them\nare reported. The breaking of N=28 magic number and the\nappearance of a new magic number at N=34 appears in our\ncalculations. A proper angular momentum projection may tell\nus the exact lowering of binding energy and it may happen\nthat the superdeformed would be the ground band of some of\nthe neutron-rich nuclei. Work in this direction is worth doing\nbecause of the present interest in the topic of the drip-line nuclei. In this study we find that, for the SD shape, the low \u03a9\norbits (particularly \u03a9 = 1/2) become more bound and show a\nparity doublet structure. Closelying parity-doublet band structures and enhanced electromagnetic transition rates are a clear\npossibility for the superdeformed shapes.\n\nsentive cases, we present here results for (34 Mg \u2212 32 Mg) and\n(47 Al \u2212 46 Al) and plot the 1/2+ and 1/2\u2212 orbits for the superdeformed and normal deformed shapes of these nuclei. We\nnotice from the plot of the orbits that there is occurrence of\n1/2+ and 1/2\u2212 orbits very closeby in energy for the superdeformed (SD) shape. Two such 1/2+ and 1/2\u2212 doublet structures, marked in asterisk are shown in Figs. 4 and 5 for the\nSD solutions. Such 1/2+ 1/2\u2212 degenerate orbits occur not\nonly for the well-bound orbits but also for the unbound continuum states. As example, the doublet neutrons [220]1/2+\nand [101]1/2\u2212 states is 4 MeV apart in energy in the normal\ndeformed prolate solutions tend to become degenerate in the\nSD solution [220]1/2+ and [101]1/2\u2212 states (prolate) belonging to two different major shells, so close to each other in the\nsuperdeformed solution (shown in Figs. 4 for 34 Mg). More\nsuch doublets are easily identified (Figs. 4 and 5) for superdeformed solutions of 32,34 Mg and 46,47 Al. In fact it is noticed\nthat the \u03a9 = 1/2 states of unique parity, seen clearly well\nseparated in the normal deformed solutions, get quite close to\neach other for the SD states, suggesting degenerate parity doublet structure. This can lead to parity mixing and octupole deformed shapes for the SD structures [38]. Parity doublets and\noctupole deformation for superdeformed solutions have been\n\nThis work has been supported in part by Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (No. 03(1060)06/EMR-II) as\nwell as projects No. SR/S2/HEP-16/2005 and SR/S2/HEP037/2008, Department of Science and Technology, Govt. of\nIndia.\n\n[1] A.
