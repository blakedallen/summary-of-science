We prove that the space of Sasaki metrics is an infinite dimensional symmetric space and that the transverse scalar\ncurvature of a Sasaki metric is a moment map of the strict contactomophism\ngroup.\n\n1. Introduction\nSasaki geometry, in particular Sasaki-Einstein manifolds, has been extensively\nstudied. Readers are referred to recent monograph Boyer-Galicki [1], and recent\nsurvey paper Sparks [30] and the references in for history, background and recent\nprogress of Sasaki geometry and Sasaki-Einstein manifolds.\nSasaki geometry is often described as an odd-dimensional analogue of K\u00e4hler\ngeometry. Some important results in K\u00e4hler geometry have now a counterpart in\nthe Sasaki context. For example, Calabi's extremal problem in Kahler geometry\nhas been extended to the Sasaki manifolds and some important results have been\nobtained [2, 3, 16]. In this note we shall discuss the notion of stability of constant\nscalar curvature metrics in Sasaki context. One can see that the picture regarding\nthe stability of constant scalar curvature described by S.K. Donaldson [8, 9] can be\ncarried over to the Sasaki setting with only slight modification.\nIt is well known in K\u00e4hler geometry that there are obstructions to the existence\nof extremal metrics in general [26, 21, 15, 5]; there is now a very beautiful picture\nregarding the existence of constant scalar curvature metrics on algebraic varieties,\nwhich is conjectured to be equivalent to certain notion of stability in algebraic\ngeometry [33, 32, 11]; this picture can also be generalized to extremal metrics\n[24, 31]. There has also been important progress to understand obstructions of\ncanonical metrics in Sasaki geometry [17, 16, 2]. In particular, Gauntlett-MartelliSparks-Yau [17] has proved the Lichnerowicz obstruction and the Bishop obstruction\nto existence of Sasaki Einstein metrics. Their results provide new obstructions to\nexistence of K\u00e4hler-Einstein metrics on K\u00e4hler orbifolds. Recently Ross-Thomas\n[28] studied stability of K\u00e4hler orbifolds and constant scalar curvature metrics on\nK\u00e4hler orbifolds.\n2010 Mathematics Subject Classification.

One of the\nkey observations relating canonical metrics in K\u00e4hler geometry with the geometry\nof infinite dimensional groups and spaces is that the scalar curvature of a K\u00e4hler\nmanifold (V, \u03c9) can be interpreted as a moment map of symplectomorphism group\nof (V, \u03c9) [14, 8]. We shall show similar pictures described in [8, 9] can be extended\nto Sasaki geometry with only slight modification. Our discussion follows closely the\ndiscussion by S.K. Donaldson [8, 9] in (almost) K\u00e4hler setting. While the picture\ndescribed by Donaldson stimulates tremendous work in Kahler geometry; it might\nstill be worth to show that the similar picture holds for the Sasaki case, even though\nthere is no new idea beyond [8, 9] and there is only few modification to prove the\nresults.\nIn Section 3 we consider the space of Sasaki metrics studied in [18, 19] , which is\nthe analogue of the space of K\u00e4hler metrics as in [23, 29, 9]. Guan-Zhang [18, 19]\nstudied the geometry of the space of Sasaki metrics, in particular the geodesic equations. They proved, among others, the regularity results of the Dirichlet problem\nof the geodesic equation with applications in Sasaki geometry, parallel the results\nof Chen [7] and Calabi-Chen [6] in the space of K\u00e4hler metrics. As a consequence\nof their results, the space of Sasaki metrics is a non-postively curved metric space.\nWe observe that the space of Sasaki metrics is an infinite dimensional symmetric\nspace as in the K\u00e4hler setting [23, 29, 9]. Moreover, H can be viewed as the dual\nspace of the strict contactomorphism group G.\nIn Section 4 we show that the transverse scalar curvature of a Sasaki metric\n(K-contact metric) can be interpreted as a moment map of strict contactomorphism group; hence the \"standard picture\" described in [8, 9] can be extended to\nSasaki geometry. Thus it is not a surprise that the existence of canonical metrics\nin Sasaki geometry should also be relevant to the notion of stability, see [28] for\nrecent progress. Following [9], we shall present a problem regarding nonexistence\nof constant transverse scalar curvature metrics, using the notion of geodesic rays\nand the K-energy in Sasaki geometry [22, 19].\n2. Sasaki Geometry, the Contact Structure and the Transverse\nK\u00e4hler Structure\nA Sasaki manifold involves many interesting structures, including its underlying\ncontact structure and the transverse K\u00e4hler structure. In this section we recall these\nrelevant structures on Sasaki manifolds, or more generally, K-contact manifolds.\nLet (M, \u03b7) be a compact contact manifold of dimension 2n + 1 with a contact\n1-form \u03b7 such that \u03b7 \u2227 (d\u03b7)n is nowhere vanishing. The Reeb vector field \u03be is define\nuniquely by\n\u03b7(\u03be) = 1, \u03b9\u03be d\u03b7 = 0.\nThe 1-dimensional foliation generated by \u03be is called the Reeb foliation. The contact\nform \u03b7 defines a vector sub-bundle D of the tangent bundle T M such that D =\nker(\u03b7) and T M = D \u2295 L\u03be, where L\u03be is the trivial line bundle generalized by \u03be. A\ncontactomorphism f : M \u2192 M is a diffeomorphism which satisfies f \u2217 \u03b7 = exp(F )\u03b7\nfor some function F : M \u2192 R. The group G of contactomorphisms leaves D =\nker(\u03b7) invariant. With the 1-form \u03b7 fixed we can also define the group G of strict\n\n\fSCALAR CURVATURE ON SASAKI MANIFOLDS\n\n3\n\ncontactomorphisms by the condition f \u2217 \u03b7 = \u03b7; it is clear that G is a subgroup of G.\nWe denote the Lie algebra of G and G by h and g respectively. The Lie algebra can\nbe characterized by\nh = {X \u2208 \u0393(T M ), LX \u03b7 = F \u03b7 for some F \u2208 C \u221e (M )},\ng = {X \u2208 \u0393(T M ), LX \u03b7 = 0}.\n\nA vector field X is called contact if LX \u03b7 = F \u03b7 and it is called strict contact\nif LX \u03b7 = 0. There is a Lie algebra isomorphism between the space C \u221e (M ) of\nfunctions on M and the Lie algebra h, see [27, 1] for the details. For every function\nH : M \u2192 R, there exists a unique contact vector field X = XH : M \u2192 T M which\nsatisfies\nH = \u03b7(X), \u03b9X d\u03b7 = dH(\u03be)\u03b7 \u2212 dH.\nThe Possion bracket is then defined by\n\n2\n\n{F, H} = \u03b7([XF , XH ]).\n\nThere is also a natural L inner product on C \u221e (M ):\nZ\nhf, hi =\nf hd\u03bc,\nM\n\nn\n\n\u22121\n\nn\n\nwhere d\u03bc = (2 n!) \u03b7 \u2227 (d\u03b7) is a volume form determined by \u03b7. However this\nL2 product is not G-invariant. Instead we consider the subgroup G and the space\n\u221e\nCB\n(M ) of basic functions on M , where\n\u221e\nCB\n(M ) = {\u03c6 \u2208 C \u221e (M ) : d\u03c6(\u03be) = 0}.\n\u221e\nThen CB\n(M ) is a sub-algebra of C \u221e (M ) and it is isomorphic to the Lie algebra of\n\u221e\ng (for example, see [1] Section 6.1). The L2 inner product, restricted on CB\n(M ), is\n\u221e\n\u221e\n\u221e\nG-invariant. We can write CB (M ) = CB,0 (M ) \u2295 R, where CB,0 (M ) is the space of\nfunctions of integral zero, the L2 orthogonal complement of the constants. Now the\ngroups G has a bi-invariant metric defined by L2 inner product on its Lie algebra,\nso it furnishes an example of infinite dimensional symmetric space. When M is\na Sasaki manifold, we shall show in next section that this space has a negatively\ncurved dual.\nFirst we recall the K-contact structure. Let (M 2n+1 , \u03b7, \u03be) be a compact contact\nmanifold.\n\nDefinition 2.1. A (1, 1)-tensor field \u03a6 : T M \u2192 T M is called an almost contactcomplex structure if\n\u03a6\u03be = 0, \u03a62 = \u2212id + \u03be \u2297 \u03b7.\nIt is called an K-contact-complex structure if in addition, L\u03be \u03a6 = 0. An almost\ncontact-complex structure is compatible with \u03b7 if\nd\u03b7(\u03a6X, \u03a6Y ) = d\u03b7(X, Y ); d\u03b7(X, \u03a6X) > 0, X \u2208 D, X 6= 0.\nIf \u03a6 is compatible with \u03b7, (M, \u03b7, \u03a6) defines a Riemannian metric\n1\nd\u03b7(X, \u03a6Y ) + \u03b7(X)\u03b7(Y ),\n2\nand (M, \u03b7, \u03be, \u03a6, g) is called a contact metric structure. This metric structure is\ncalled a K-contact metric structure if L\u03be \u03a6 = 0, which corresponds to an almost\ng(X, Y ) =\n\n\f4\n\nWEIYONG HE\n\nK\u00e4hler metric on a symplectic manifold. A Sasaki structure can then be defined as\na K-contact metric structure (M, \u03b7, \u03be, \u03a6, g) where \u03a6 satisfies an integrable condition\n\u2207\u03a6(X, Y ) = g(\u03be, Y )X \u2212 g(X, Y )\u03be.\nThis definition is equivalent to the following characterization: a Riemannian metric\n(M, \u03b7, \u03be, \u03a6, g) is called Sasaki if the cone metric (C(M ) = M \u00d7 R+ , dr2 + r2 g) is\nK\u00e4hler. The complex structure J on C(M ) can be defined as\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202\n\u2202\n= \u03be, JY = \u03a6Y \u2212 \u03b7(Y )r , Y \u2208 \u0393(T M ).\nJ r\n\u2202r\n\u2202r\nFor a Sasaki structure, there are two relevant K\u00e4hler structures. One is the K\u00e4hler\ncone structure on C(M ) and the other is the transverse K\u00e4hler structure for the\nReeb foliation. For our purpose, we shall also consider the transverse almost K\u00e4hler\nstructure for a K-contact metric structure (M, \u03b7, \u03be, \u03a6, g). The discussion is similar\nas in the transverse K\u00e4hler structure [1, 16]. We shall describe the transverse almost\nK\u00e4hler structure both globally and locally.\nLet {U\u03b1 }\u03b1\u2208I \u2282 R2n+1 be an open covering of M and let \u03c0\u03b1 : U\u03b1 \u2192 V\u03b1 \u2282 R2n\nbe submersions such that d\u03c0\u03b1 (\u03be)=0 and when U\u03b1 \u2229 U\u03b2 6= \u2205\n\u03c0\u03b1 \u25e6 \u03c0\u03b2\u22121 : \u03c0\u03b2 (U\u03b1 \u2229 U\u03b2 ) \u2192 \u03c0\u03b1 (U\u03b1 \u2229 U\u03b2 )\nis diffeomorphic. On each V\u03b1 , we can define an almost K\u00e4hler metric as follows.\nLet (x1 , x2 , * * * , x2n ) be a local coordinate on V\u03b1 . We can pull this back on U\u03b1\nand still write them as x1 , x2 , * * * , x2n . Let x0 be the coordinate along the leaves\n\u2202\n0\n1\n2n\n) forms a local coordinate on U\u03b1 . Suppose we\nwith \u03be = \u2202x\n0 . Then (x , x , * * * , x\n0\ni\ncan write \u03b7 = dx \u2212 ai dx locally for some functions ai , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 2n. Since \u03b9\u03be d\u03b7 = 0,\nit is clear that dai (\u03be) = 0 and ai is a function of x1 , * * * , x2n .

We also get that D\nis spanned by the vectors of the form\n\u2202\n\u2202\n+ ai 0 , i = 1, 2, * * * , 2n.\n\u2202xi\n\u2202x\nFor any p \u2208 U\u03b1 there is an isomorphism induced by \u03c0\u03b1\nei =\n\n\u2202\n.\n\u2202xi\nAn almost contact-complex structure K can be written as\nd\u03c0\u03b1 : Dp \u2192 T\u03c0\u03b1(p) V\u03b1 ; d\u03c0\u03b1 (ei ) =\n\u03a6ei = \u03a6ji ej , \u03a6ji \u03a6kj = \u2212\u03b4ik .\nA simple computation shows that the condition \u03a6\u03be K = 0 implies that\n\u2202\u03a6ji\n= 0.\n\u2202x0\nHence we can define an almost complex structure on V\u03b1 such that\n\u03a6\u03b1\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\n= \u03a6ji\n.\n\u2202xi\n\u2202xj\n\n\fSCALAR CURVATURE ON SASAKI MANIFOLDS\n\n5\n\nIt is clear that \u03a6\u03b1 is compatible with \u03c9\u03b1 ; thus we can define an almost K\u00e4hler\nmetric g\u03b1T on V\u03b1 . By this construction,\n\u03c0\u03b1 \u25e6 \u03c0\u03b2\u22121 : \u03c0\u03b2 (U\u03b1 \u2229 U\u03b2 ) \u2192 \u03c0\u03b1 (U\u03b1 \u2229 U\u03b2 )\ngives an isometry of almost K\u00e4hler manifolds. The collection of almost K\u00e4hler\nmetrics {V\u03b1 , g\u03b1T } is called a transverse almost K\u00e4hler metric, which we denote by\ng T since they are isometric on the overlaps. We also write \u2207T , RmT , RicT , RT for\nits Levi-Civita connection, the curvature tensor, the Ricci tensor and the scalar\ncurvature. It should be emphasized that, when restricted on D, {d\u03b7/2, \u03a6, g} on\nU\u03b1 is isometric to {\u03c9\u03b1 , \u03a6\u03b1 , g\u03b1T } via d\u03c0\u03b1 : Dp \u2192 T\u03c0\u03b1 (p) V\u03b1 . So we can also define\n{D, d\u03b7/2, \u03a6|D , g|D } as an almost transverse K\u00e4hler structure via this isomorphism.\nThis isomorphism will play an important role in our computations in the following\nsections. The transverse scalar curvature RT also lifts to M as a global function.\nWhen (M, \u03b7, \u03be, \u03a6, g) is Sasaki, it is easy to see that \u03a6\u03b1 is a complex structure\non V\u03b1 , hence it defines the transverse complex structure or transverse holomorphic\nstructure on the Reeb foliation. In particular, we can choose coordinates charts\nV\u03b1 \u2282 Cn with coordinates (z 1 , * * * , z n ) such that\n\u221a\n\u2202\n\u2202\n= \u22121\n;\n\u03a6\u03b1\n\u2202zi\n\u2202zi\nthis with \u03c9\u03b1 gives its transverse K\u00e4hler structure (for example see [16] Section 3).\nThe corresponding charts U\u03b1 with coordinates (x0 , z 1 , * * * , z n ) are called foliations\ncharts.\nNow let (M, \u03b7, \u03be, \u03a6) be a compact Sasaki manifold.\nDefinition 2.2. A p-form \u03b8 on M is called basic if\n\u03b9\u03be \u03b8 = 0, L\u03be \u03b8 = 0.\nLet \u039bpB\nof \u039bpB .\n\nbe the sheaf of germs of basic p-forms and \u03a9pB = \u0393(S, \u039bpB ) the set of sections\n\nThe exterior differential preserves basic forms. We set dB = d|\u03a9pB . There is a\nnatural splitting of \u039bpB \u2297 C such that\n\u039bpB \u2297 C = \u2295\u039bi,j\nB ,\n\nwhere \u039bi,j\nB is the bundle of type (i, j) basic forms. We thus have the well defined\noperators (for example, see Section 4 [16])\ni+1,j\n\u2202B : \u03a9i,j\n,\nB \u2192 \u03a9B\ni,j\ni,j+1\n \u0304\n\u2202B : \u03a9B \u2192 \u03a9B .\n\u0001\n\u221a\nThen we have dB = \u2202B + \u2202 \u0304B . Set dcB = 12 \u22121 \u2202 \u0304B \u2212 \u2202B . It is clear that\n\u221a\ndB dcB = \u22121\u2202B \u2202 \u0304B , d2B = (dcB )2 = 0.\n\nUsing the foliation chart, we can also check that\n1 \u221a i\u2212j\ndcB =\n\u22121 \u03a6 \u25e6 dB on \u03a9i,j\nB .\n2\nAs in [18, 19], we consider the space of Sasaki metrics as follows\n\u221e\nH = {\u03c6 \u2208 CB\n(M ), \u03b7\u03c6 \u2227 (d\u03b7\u03c6 )n 6= 0, \u03b7\u03c6 = \u03b7 + dcB \u03c6},\n\n\f6\n\nWEIYONG HE\n\nwhich can be viewed as an analogue of the space of K\u00e4hler metrics in a fixed\nK\u00e4hler class studied in [23, 29, 9]. For any \u03c6 \u2208 H, we can define a new Sasaki\nmetric (\u03b7\u03c6 , \u03be, \u03a6\u03c6 , g\u03c6 ) with the same Reeb vector field \u03be such that\n\u03b7\u03c6 = \u03b7 + dcB \u03c6, \u03a6\u03c6 = \u03a6 \u2212 \u03be \u2297 dcB \u03c6 \u25e6 \u03a6.\nNote that D varies and the K-contact structure \u03a6\u03c6 varies when \u03c6 varies but\n(\u03b7\u03c6 , \u03be, \u03a6\u03c6 , g\u03c6 ) has the same transverse holomorphic structure as (\u03b7, \u03be, \u03a6, g) (Prop.\n4.1 in [16], [1]); for example, we have the relation when \u03c6 varies,\n\u03a6 \u25e6 dB = \u03a6\u03c6 \u25e6 dB .\nOn the contrary, if (\u03b7\u0303, \u03be, \u03a6\u0303, g\u0303) is another Sasaki structure with the same Reeb vector\nfield \u03be and the same transverse K\u00e4hler structure, then there exists a unique function\n\u03c6 \u2208 H up to addition of a constant (e.g. [13]) such that\n\u221a\n \u0304\nd\u03b7\u0303 = d\u03b7\u03c6 = d\u03b7 + \u22121\u2202 \u2202\u03c6.\n\n \u0304 as in [2], where J \u0304 denotes a fixed transverse\nWe shall denote this set by S(\u03be, J)\nhomomorphic structure on \u03bd(F\u03be ).

Boyer-GalickiSimanca [2, 3] proposed to seek the extremal Sasaki metrics to represent S(\u03be, J \u0304), by\nextending Calabi's extremal problem to Sasaki geometry (see [16] also). A metric is\ncalled a transverse extremal K\u00e4hler metric. To seek an extremal metric in S(\u03be, J \u0304)\nis then reduced to find a function \u03c6 \u2208 H such that the Sasaki metric (\u03b7\u03c6 , \u03be, \u03a6\u03c6 , g\u03c6 )\nis transverse extremal.\nWe conclude this section with the following proposition, which will be used in the\nfollowing sections. Let (M, g) be a Sasaki metric and g T be its transverse K\u00e4hler\nmetric. Let U\u03b1 , (x0 , z 1 , * * * , z n ) be a foliation chart and \u03c0\u03b1 : U\u03b1 \u2192 V\u03b1 such that\nd\u03c0\u03b1 : Dp \u2192 T\u03c0\u03b1 (p) V\u03b1 .\nLet\ngiTj\u0304 = g T\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\n,\n\u2202zi \u2202 z\u0304j\n\n\u0013\n\nand gTij\u0304 be its inverse.

The Space of Sasaki Metrics as a Symmetric Space\nIn this section we show that H is an infinite-dimensional symmetric space, as in\nK\u00e4hler setting [23, 29, 9]. It can be viewed as the negatively curved dual space of\nG, see [9] for the K\u00e4hler setting.\n\n\fSCALAR CURVATURE ON SASAKI MANIFOLDS\n\n7\n\nLet (M, \u03be, \u03b7, \u03a6) be a compact Sasaki manifold. We shall briefly recall the geometric structure on H introduced in [18]. For any \u03c6 \u2208 H, we can define a metric\non T\u03c6 H\nZ\nh\u03c81 , \u03c82 i\u03c6 =\n\nM\n\n\u03c81 \u03c82 d\u03bc\u03c6 , \u2200\u03c81 , \u03c82 \u2208 T H,\n\nwhere d\u03bc\u03c6 = (2n n!)\u22121 \u03b7\u03c6 \u2227 (d\u03b7\u03c6 )n is the volume form determined by g\u03c6 . If \u03c6(t) :\n[0, 1] \u2192 H is a path, the geodesic equation can be written as\n\n1\n\u03c6\u0308 \u2212 |dB \u03c6\u0307|2\u03c6 = 0.\n4\nThus \u03c8(t) is a field of tangent vectors along the path \u03c6(t) \u2208 H, the covariant\nderivative along the path is given by\nd\n1\n\u03c8 \u2212 (dB \u03c6\u0307, dB \u03c8)\u03c6 .\ndt\n4\nGuan-Zhang proved [18] that this connection is torsion free and compatible with\nthe metric\nd\nk\u03c8k2\u03c6 = 2hDt \u03c8, \u03c8i;\ndt\nThey also proved that the corresponding sectional curvature of H is nonpositive\nand there is a Riemannian decomposition\nD\u03c6\u0307 \u03c8 =\n\nH = H0 \u00d7 R,\n\nwhere H0 = H/R.\n\nTheorem 3.1. H is an infinite dimensional symmetric space; the curvature of the\nconnection D is covariant constant. At a point \u03c6 \u2208 H the curvature is given by\n1\nR\u03c6 (\u03c81 , \u03c82 )\u03c83 = \u2212 {{\u03c81 , \u03c82 }\u03c6 , \u03c83 }\u03c6 ,\n16\n\u221e\nwhere { , }\u03c6 is the Possion bracket on CB\n(M ) induced by the contact form \u03b7\u03c6 .\nProof. First we observe that (M, \u03b7\u03c6 ) are all equivalent as contact structures. Let\n\u03c6(t) be a path starting at 0 in H and consider the t dependent vector field\n1\nXt = \u2212 \u2207g(t) \u03c6\u0307,\n4\nwhere g(t) is the metric determined by (M, \u03be, \u03b7(t), \u03a6(t)). Let ft : M \u2192 M be the\n1-parameter family of diffeomorphisms obtained by integrating X(t) with f0 = 1M .\nThen we compute that\n\u0012\n\u0013\nd \u2217\nd\n(ft \u03b7(t)) = ft\u2217 LXt \u03b7(t) + \u03b7(t)\ndt\ndt\n\nFor any t, d\u03c6(t)(\u03be) = 0, we get that d\u03c6\u0307(\u03be) = 0. Hence h\u03be, \u2207g(t) \u03c6\u0307ig(t) = 0. This\nimplies that Xt \u2208 D(t) = ker(\u03b7(t)). So we can compute\nLXt \u03b7(t) = \u03b9Xt d\u03b7(t) + d(\u03b9Xt \u03b7(t)) = \u03b9Xt d\u03b7(t).\nFor each t fixed and Y \u2208 T M ,\n\u03b9Xt d\u03b7(t)(Y ) = d\u03b7(t)(Xt , Y ) = \u22122hXt , \u03a6(t)Y ig(t) =\n=\n\n1\nh\u2207\u03c6\u0307, \u03a6(t)Y i\n2\n\n1\n1\ndB \u03c6\u0307(\u03a6(t)Y ) = \u2212 (\u03a6(t) \u25e6 dB )\u03c6\u0307(Y ) = \u2212dcB \u03c6\u0307(Y ).\n2\n2\n\n\f8\n\nWEIYONG HE\n\nOn the other hand, the t-derivative of \u03b7(t) is dcB \u03c6\u0307. So we have\n\u0012\n\u0013\nd\nd \u2217\nft (\u03b7(t)) = ft\u2217 LXt \u03b7(t) + \u03b7(t) = 0,\ndt\ndt\ni.e. the diffeomorphism ft gives the desired contactomorphism from (M, \u03b70 ) to\n(M, \u03b7(t)). Now let Y \u2282 H \u00d7 Dif f (M ) be the set of pairs (\u03c6, f ) such that f \u2217 \u03b7\u03c6 = \u03b7.\nThis is a principal bundle over H with structure group G. Then the discussion\nabove shows that the connection D on the tangent space of H is induced from a G\n\u221e\nconnection on Y \u2192 H via the action of G on CB\n(M ); that is, we have a connection\npreserving bundle isomorphism\n\u221e\nT H = Y \u00d7G CB\n(M ).\n\u221e\nAnd the connection D is compatible with the metric since the L2 norm on CB\n(M )\nis G invariant. Now we compute the curvature tensor of H. To do this we consider\na 2-parameter family \u03c6(s, t) in H, and a vector field \u03c8(s, t) along \u03c6(s, t). We denote\ns and t derivatives by suffixes \u03c6s , \u03c6t etc. The curvature is given by\n\nR\u03c6 (\u03c6s , \u03c6t )\u03c8 = (Ds Dt \u2212 Dt Ds )\u03c8.\nIt is clear that R(\u03c6s , \u03c6t )\u03c8 is linear in \u03c6, \u03c8. It is also clear that all functions involved\nare basic functions. Hence we can do computation by using the transverse K\u00e4hler\nstructure defined by {D\u03c6 , \u03b7\u03c6 , \u03a6\u03c6 , g\u03c6 }. We can write, for example, in a foliation\nchart U\u03b1 \u2282 M ,\n(dB \u03c81 , dB \u03c82 )\u03c6 = (\u2207T \u03c81 , \u2207T \u03c82 )gT ,\n\nwhere \u2207T is the Levi-Civita connection of the transverse K\u00e4hler metric g T defined by {D\u03c6 , \u03b7\u03c6 , \u03a6\u03c6 , g\u03c6 }. We also consider the projection \u03c0\u03b1 : U\u03b1 \u2192 V\u03b1 and the\ncorresponding complex structure on V\u03b1 is denoted as \u03a6\u03b1\n\u03c6.\nExpanding out, we compute\n(3.1)\n\u0013\n\u2202\n\u2202\nT\nT\nT\nT\n(\u2207 \u03c8, \u2207 \u03c6s )gT \u2212\n(\u2207 \u03c8, \u2207 \u03c6t )gT\n4R\u03c6 (\u03c6s , \u03c6t )\u03c8 =\n\u2202t\n\u2202s\n\u0001\n+ (\u2207T \u03c8s , \u2207T \u03c6t )gT \u2212 (\u2207T \u03c8t , \u2207T \u03c6s )gT\n\u0001\n\u0001\n+ \u2207T (\u2207T \u03c8, \u2207T \u03c6s )gT , \u2207T \u03c6t gT \u2212 \u2207T (\u2207T \u03c8, \u2207T \u03c6t )gT , \u2207T \u03c6s gT\n\u0012\n\nOn the other hand, we can write the Possion bracket { , } as follows. For any\n\u221e\nf, h \u2208 CB\n(M ),\nT\n{f, h}\u03c6 = \u03b7\u03c6 ([Xf , Xh ]) = \u2212d\u03b7\u03c6 (Xf , Xh ) = 2(\u2207T f, \u03a6\u03b1\n\u03c6 \u2207 h)gT .\n\nHence we compute\n1\nT\n\u03b1 T\n{{\u03c6s , \u03c6t }, \u03c8}\u03c6 = (\u2207T (\u2207T \u03c6s , \u03a6\u03b1\n\u03c6 \u2207 \u03c6t )gT , \u03a6\u03c6 \u2207 \u03c8)gT .\n4\nNow we claim that the right hand side of (3.1) coincides with the right hand side\nof (3.2). Note that all the quantities above are only involved with the transverse\nK\u00e4hler structure and we can express all these quantities in terms of the Kahler\nmetric g\u03b1T on V\u03b1 . Hence this reduces the computations to the Kahler setting and\nthe same argument in [9] (Page 18) can be carried over here directly without any\nchange. The only difference is that the K\u00e4hler form of g\u03b1T is d\u03b7\u03c6 /2 while the Possion\n(3.2)\n\n\fSCALAR CURVATURE ON SASAKI MANIFOLDS\n\n9\n\nbracket is defined by \u03b7\u03c6 and d\u03b7\u03c6 . So there is difference of a constant factor 4 and\nwe get\n1\nR\u03c6 (\u03c6s , \u03c6t )\u03c8 = \u2212 {{\u03c6s , \u03c6t }\u03c6 , \u03c8}\u03c6 .\n16\nThe expression of the curvature tensor in terms of Possion brackets shows that R\u03c6\nis invariant under the action of the group G; it follows that R\u03c6 is covariant constant\nand hence H is indeed an infinite-dimensional symmetric space.\n\u0003\nRemark 3.2. It is clear that the Riemannian decomposition H = H0 \u00d7 R corre\u221e\n\u221e\nsponds to the Lie algebra decomposition CB\n(M ) = CB,0\n(M ) \u2295 R. When (M, \u03be, \u03b7)\nis quasiregular, then \u03be generates one parameter subgroup of G which lies in the center of G (in quasiregular case, the orbits of \u03be are compact, hence are all circles,\nthen \u03be generates a circle action on M which preserves \u03b7), then we have the group\nisomorphism\nG \u2248 G/S 1 \u00d7 S 1 ,\n\u221e\n\u221e\nwhich corresponds the Lie algebra decomposition CB\n(M ) = CB,0\n(M ) \u2295 R.\n\n4. Transverse Scalar Curvature as a Moment Map\nIn this section we show that the transverse scalar curvature of a Sasaki metric is\na moment map with respect to the strict contactomorphism group G. When (V, \u03c9)\nis a symplectic manifold and let J be the space of almost complex structures which\nare compatible with \u03c9. Then scalar curvature R : J \u2192 C \u221e (M ) is a moment map\nof symplectomorphism group of (V, \u03c9) which acts on J [14, 9]. This point of view of\nmoment map can be carried over to Sasaki geometry with only slight modification.\nFirst let us recall the definition of a moment map. Let (V, \u03c9) be a symplectic\nmanifold with a symplectic form \u03c9. Suppose that a Lie group G acts on V via\nsymplectomorphisms. Let g be the Lie algebra of G. Then any \u03b6 \u2208 g induces a\none-parameter subgroup {\u03c6(t)} in G, and {\u03c6(t)} induces a vector field X\u03b6 on V\nsince G acts on V . A moment map for the G-action on (V, \u03c9) is a map \u03bc : V \u2192 g\u2217\nsuch that\ndh\u03bc, \u03b6i = \u03b9X\u03b6 \u03c9.\nHere h\u03bc, \u03b6i is the function from V to R defined by h\u03bc, \u03b6i(x) = h\u03bc(x), \u03b6i. We also\nrequire that the moment map \u03bc is G-equivariant with respect to the co-adjoint\naction of G on g\u2217 .\nConsider a compact contact manifold (M 2n+1 , \u03b7). Let K be the space of Kcontact-complex structures on M which are compatible with \u03b7; we shall assume K\nis not empty. We shall show that the space K can be endowed with the structure\nof an infinite-dimensional K\u00e4hler manifold. Let G be the strict contactomorphism\ngroup which preserves the contact form \u03b7. Then G acts on K via\n(f, \u03a6) \u2192 f\u2217\u22121 \u03a6f\u2217 .\n\nFor simplicity we consider \u03a6 \u2208 K is integrable. Let Kint \u2282 K defined as\nKint = {\u03a6 \u2208 K : \u03a6 is integrable}.\nWe assume Kint is not empty. We want to identify a moment map for the action\nof G on Kint . For each \u03a6 \u2208 Kint , (M, \u03b7, \u03a6) defines a Sasaki metric g, and let\n{D, 21 d\u03b7, \u03a6|D } be its transverse K\u00e4hler metric. We have\n\n\f10\n\nWEIYONG HE\n\nTheorem 4.1. The map \u03a6 \u2192 RT (\u03a6) is an equivariant moment map for the Gaction on Kint , under the natural pairing:\nZ\nT\n(R , H) \u2192\nRT Hd\u03bc\u03b7 .\nM\n\nFirst observe that\nTK K = {A : T M \u2192 T M ; A\u03be = 0, L\u03be A = 0, A\u03a6+\u03a6A = 0, d\u03b7(\u03a6A*, *)+d\u03b7(*, \u03a6A*) = 0}.\nNote that if A \u2208 TK K, then \u03a6A \u2208 TK K; hence we can define a natural almost\nstructure JK : TK K \u2192 TK K on K such that\nJK A = \u03a6A.\nWe can define a natural metric on K. For any A \u2208 TK K, we can identify A with\nA(X, Y ) = g\u03a6 (AX, Y ), X, Y \u2208 T M.\nIt is clear that A is anti-\u03a6 invariant and symmetric. We can identify A with a\nsection of T \u2217 M \u2297 T \u2217 M . The metric g\u03a6 induces a metric on T \u2217 M \u2297 T \u2217 M . So we\ncan define a metric on T\u03a6 K by integration over M ,\nZ\nhA, Big\u03a6 d\u03bc.\ngK (A, B) =\nM\n\nFor p \u2208 M , if Dp = span{ei : 1 \u2264 i \u2264 2n}, and Ap : Dp \u2192 Dp such that Ap ei =\nAji ej . Then hA, Bip = trace(Ap Bp ) = Aji Bji . It is clear that gK is compatible with\nJK ; hence it defines an Hermitian metric on K. As in the (almost) K\u00e4hler setting,\n(K, gK , JK ) induces a natural K\u00e4hler structure on K.\nProposition 4.2. (K, gK , JK ) is K\u00e4hler and Kint is an analytic submanifold.\nNote that \u03a6 \u2208 K can be identified as an almost complex structure on D which\nis invariant under the action generated by \u03be, hence K can be viewed the space\nof sections of a fibre bundle on M with fibre the complex homogeneous space\nSp(2n, R)/U (n). Then K inherits a complex structure from that of the fibre. Indeed, there is a global holomorphic coordinate chart if we use the ball model of\nthe Siegel upper half space in the usual way, see [14] Theorem 4.2 and [9] for more\ndetails.\nNow we are in the position to prove Theorem 4.1.\nProof. Fix a K-contact-complex structure \u03a6 \u2208 Kint ; let\n\u221e\nP : CB\n(M ) \u2192 \u0393(T K)\n\nbe the operator representing the infinitesimal action of G on Kint and\n\u221e\nQ : \u0393(T K) \u2192 CB\n(M )\n\nbe the operator which represents the derivative of \u03a6 \u2192 RT (\u03a6). By the definition\n\u221e\nof a moment map we need to show that for all \u03c6 \u2208 CB\n(M ), A \u2208 \u0393(T K),\ngK (JK P(\u03c6), A) = h\u03c6, Q(A)i.\nThe operator P can be factored as P = P2 P1 , where P1 maps \u03c6 to the Hamiltonian\nvector field X\u03c6 and P2 maps a vector filed X to the infinitesimal variation given by\n\n\fSCALAR CURVATURE ON SASAKI MANIFOLDS\n\n11\n\nthe Lie derivative LX \u03a6. We choose a coordinate chart U\u03b1 = {(x0 , x1 , * * * , x2n )} as\nin Section 2, such that\n\u001a\n\u001b\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n0\ni\n\u03b7 = dx \u2212 ai dx , \u03be =\n, D = span\n+ ai 0 , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 2n .\n\u2202x0\n\u2202xi\n\u2202x\nLet V\u03b1 = {(x1 , * * * , x2n )} such that \u03c0\u03b1 : U\u03b1 \u2192 V\u03b1 is a submersion. Recall \u03c9\u03b1 =\nd\u03b7/2 = (\u03c9ij ), \u03a6\u03b1 = (\u03a6ji ) and g\u03b1T the transverse K\u00e4her structure. For simplicity\nwe suppress \u03b1 and write g\u03b1T = (gij ) = (\u03c9ik \u03a6kj ), 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 2n. It is clear that on\nU\u03b1 , we can write A = (Aji ) for some functions Aji independent of x0 , as we have\ndiscussed in Section 2. Hence we can define A\u03b1 on V\u03b1 , which we still denote as\nA\u03b1 = (Aji ). Note that all quantities involved in the computations can be written\nlocally on V\u03b1 and we have the isometry of {D, 21 d\u03b7, \u03a6|D } with g T . So we can do all\n(local) computations on V\u03b1 . Since \u03b9X\u03c6 d\u03b7 = \u2212d\u03c6, we have\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 \u2202\u03c6\n\u2202\n=\u2212\n.\n\u03c9 X\u03c6 ,\n\u2202xj\n2 \u2202xj\nIt follows that\nX\u03c6 = X i\n\n1\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2202\n= \u2212 \u03a6jk g ki\n.\n\u2202xi\n2\n\u2202xj\n\nSuppose that\nLX\u03c6 \u03a6 = Bji\n\n\u2202\n\u2297 dxj ;\n\u2202xi\n\nthen we have\nBji\n\n\u2202\n= LX\u03c6 \u03a6\n\u2202xi\n\n\u0012\n\nHence\nBji =\n\n\u2202\n\u2202xj\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202\n\u2202\n= LX\u03c6 \u03a6\n\u2212 \u03a6 LX\u03c6\n.\n\u2202xj\n\u2202xj\n\n1 k p li\n1\n\u03a6j \u03a6l g \u03c6kp \u2212 \u03a6ik g kl \u03a6pl \u03c6pj .\n2\n2\n\nIt follows that\nP(\u03c6) =\n\n\u0001\n1 k l\n\u03a6i \u03a6j \u03c6kl \u2212 \u03c6ij .\n2\n\nWe can then compute the pairing\nZ\nZ\nhP(\u03c6), JK Aid\u03bc =\ngK (JK P(\u03c6), A) = \u2212\n\ng jk g pl \u03a6ip \u03c6ij Akl d\u03bc,\n\nM\n\nM\n\n\u0001\nwhere Aij = gik Akj , 1 \u2264 i, j, k, l, p \u2264 2n. Now we compute Q(A). Since \u03b4g T ij =\n\u03c9ik Akj = \u03a6ki Akj , the well-known formula of the variation of the scalar curvature\nRT is given by\n\u0001\n\u0001\nT\n\u03b4RT = \u22122g ij g kl (\u03b4g)il Rjk\n+ g ik g jl \u03b4g T ij,kl \u2212 g ij g kl \u03b4g T ij,kl .\n\nT\nNote that the metric g T and the Ricci curvature Rij\nare \u03a6-invariant and A is anti\n\u03a6-invariant, we can get that\n\u0001\n\u0001\nT\n= 0, g ij \u03b4g T ij = 0.\ng ij g kl \u03b4g T il Rjk\n\nIt follows that\n\nQ(A) = \u03b4RT = g ik g jl \u03b4g T\n\n\u0001\n\nij,kl\n\n= g ik g jl (\u03a6pi Apj ),kl .\n\n\f12\n\nWEIYONG HE\n\nWe can compute, integration by parts,\nZ\nZ\n\u03c6g ik g jl (\u03a6pi Apj ),kl d\u03bc =\nh\u03c6, Q(A)i =\nM\n\nM\n\ng ik g jl \u03a6pi \u03c6kl Apj d\u03bc.\n\nThe integration by parts above can be justified as in Proposition 4.5 [20], by noting\nthat all the integrands involved are basic, namely, are invariant under the group\naction generated by \u03be. Hence we get the desired equality\ngK (JK P(\u03c6), A) = h\u03c6, Q(A)i.\n\u0003\nRemark 4.3. The similar results should hold for K, the space of K-contact complex\nstructures which are compatible with a fixed contact form. One should consider\nthe transverse Hermitian scalar curvature defined by the almost transverse K\u00e4hler\nstructure, but have to take the Nijenhuis tensor into account, as in [9] for the almost\nK\u00e4hler setting. We shall assume integrability for simplicity.\n5. Canonical Metrics in Sasaki Geometry\nCalabi's extremal metric problem [4, 5] in K\u00e4hler geometry are closely related\nto the geometry of the space of K\u00e4hler metrics and the space of complex structures\nwhich are compatible with a fixed K\u00e4hler form. We refer the reader to the papers of\nS.K. Donaldson [8, 9] for details. Calabi's extremal problem can also be extended\nto Sasaki geometry, see [2, 3] for example.\nWe have seen that the standard picture in [8, 9] can be applied to Sasaki geometry; hence canonical metric problems in Sasaki geometry are also closely related to\nthe geometry of H and K. We shall roughly repeat the picture described in [8, 9]\nfor Sasaki context as follows.\nIf (V, \u03c9, J) is a K\u00e4hler manifold and assume there is an action of a compact\nconnected group G on V which preserves the K\u00e4hler structure. Let \u03bc be the corresponding moment map. This induces a holomorphic action of the complexified\ngroup GC . Then the Kempf-Ness theorem relates the complex quotient by GC to\nthe symplectic reduction by G ([12]).\nNow let (M, \u03b7, \u03be) be a Sasaki manifold. The strict contactomorphism group G\nacts on the K\u00e4hler manifold Kint as holomorphic isometries, and the transverse\n\u221e\nscalar curvature RT : Kint \u2192 CB\n(M ) is an equivariant moment map of G-action\nint\nT\non K . Let m = R \u2212R, where R is the average of the transverse scalar curvature,\n\u221e\ndepending only on the basic class [d\u03b7]B . Then m : Kint \u2192 CB\n(M ) is also a moment\nc\nmap of G. If there is a complexification group G of G, then by the standard picture,\na constant transverse scalar curvature metric, which is a zero point of the moment\nmap m, corresponds to a stable complex orbit of G c action and we expect the\nidentification\nKsint /G c = m\u22121 (0)/G.\nIn general, G c might not exist. However we can complexify the Lie algebra of G\nand it acts on Kint automatically since Kint is a complex manifold. At each point\n\u03a6 \u2208 Kint we get a subspace of T\u03a6 Kint spanned by this complexification action and\nthese subspaces form an integrable, holomorphic distribution on Kint . Thus we get\na distribution of Kint which plays the role of the complex orbits. By definition,\nthe infinitesimal action of \u03c6 on Kint is given by LX\u03c6 \u03a6 for any \u03a6 \u2208 T\u03a6 Kint , then\n\u221a\n\u221e\n(M ) \u2297 C is L\u03a6X\u03c6 \u03a6, the natural\nthe infinitesimal action of a function \u22121\u03c6 \u2208 CB\n\n\fSCALAR CURVATURE ON SASAKI MANIFOLDS\n\n13\n\n\u221a\naction of \u03a6X\u03c6 on \u03a6. Thus the geometric effect of applying \u22121\u03c6 is the same as\nkeeping the transverse holomorphic structure induced by \u03a6 fixed and varying the\ntransverse symplectic form 12 d\u03b7 to\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u221a\n1\n1\n1\n1\n \u0304\nd\u03b7\u0303 = d\u03b7 \u2212 L\u03a6X\u03c6\nd\u03b7 = d\u03b7 + \u22121\u2202 \u2202\u03c6,\n2\n2\n2\n2\nwhich corresponds to the space of Sasaki metrics H.\nWe shall recall the definition of K-energy in Sasaki geometry [22, 19], which is\ndefined on H by specifying its variation\nZ\n\u03b4\u03c6(RT \u2212 R)d\u03bc\u03c6 .\n\u03b4M = \u2212\nM\n\nA critical point of M is a constant transverse scalar curvature and M is convex\nalong geodesics in H [19].\nWe can also ask the similar questions as in [9] regarding the existence of constant\ntransverse scalar curvature metrics, which can be viewed as an analogue of the\nHilbert criterion for stability in geometric invariant theory.\nProblem 5.1. The following are equivalent:\n(1). There is no critical K\u00e4hler metric in H0 .\n(2). There is an infinite geodesic ray \u03c6t \u2208 H0 , such that t \u2192 \u221e, the derivative\nof K-energy is less than zero along the geodesic ray \u03c6t ,\nZ\n\u03c6\u0307(R \u2212 RT )d\u03bc\u03c6 < 0.\nM\n\n(3).
