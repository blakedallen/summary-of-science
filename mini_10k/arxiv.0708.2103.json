Figure 1a shows a radio image of\nthe region from Yusef-Zadeh & Morris (1987a), where the labels refer to the objects discussed\nin this paper. The Radio Arc (Yusef-Zadeh et al. 1984) consists of non-thermally emitting\nlinear filaments perpendicular to the Galactic plane; the Arched Filaments and Sickle, on the\nother hand, are thermal emitters, as is seen from their production of radio recombination\nlines (e.g., Yusef-Zadeh & Morris 1987b; Morris & Yusef-Zadeh 1989; Lang et al. 1997,\n2001). Figure 1b shows a Band E (21 \u03bcm) image from the Midcourse Space Experiment,\nMSX (Egan et al. 1998; Price et al. 2001). At 21 \u03bcm, most of the emission comes from\nwarm dust.\nSgr A West is an H II region at the very center of the Galaxy, to which we assume\na distance of 8 kpc. It contains a cluster of massive stars and the black hole, which is\ncoincident with radio source Sgr A*. The other two clusters of massive stars, the Arches\nCluster and the Quintuplet Cluster, are located about 25 pc away in the plane of the sky.\nThe Arches Cluster, whose O and Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars were first discussed by Nagata et\nal. (1995) and Cotera et al. (1996), contains \u223c 104 M\u2299 (Stolte et al. 2002), emits \u223c 1051.6\nionizing photons s\u22121 (Figer et al. 2002), and is suggested to have an age of \u223c 2.5 Myr (Figer\net al. 2002). The Quintuplet Cluster, named after the five luminous near-infrared (NIR)\nobjects that may be dusty carbon WR stars (see the discussion by Moneti et al. 2001), is a\nlittle smaller (1050.9 s\u22121 ionizing photons, Figer et al. 1999b) than the Arches Cluster and\nprobably older (Figer et al. 1999a, 1999b).\nGiven that it takes . 1 Myr for a cluster to orbit the GC, it is probable that either\nor both the Arches and Quintuplet Clusters are now separated from their natal molecular\nclouds. Any interactions with the GC's massive molecular clouds come from the long range\neffects of the clusters' high ionizing luminosities and the strong winds from their massive O\nand WR stars. With discovery of the hot stars of the Arches and Quintuplet Clusters, it\nwas immediately suggested that these clusters provide the ionizing photons needed to power\nthe Arched Filaments and Sickle, respectively (e.g., Cotera et al. 1996; Figer et al. 1995;\nTimmermann et al. 1996).\nSince the thermal ionized gas was discovered before the star clusters, there were originally questions regarding the source of excitation of the gas (e.g., Erickson et al. 1991).\nWith the discovery of the two clusters, proof was sought that these are the exciting clusters\nby measuring the excitation variations (i.e., the ionization structure) as a function of distance from the clusters. To do this, far infrared (FIR) lines were observed using the Kuiper\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nAirborne Observatory (KAO) (Colgan et al. 1996; Simpson et al. 1997) and the Infrared\nSpace Observatory (ISO) (Rodr\u0131\u0301guez-Fern\u00e1ndez et al. 2001b; Cotera et al. 2005). For both\nthe Arched Filaments (Colgan et al. 1996; Cotera et al. 2005) and the Sickle (Simpson et\nal. 1997; Rodr\u0131\u0301guez-Fern\u00e1ndez et al. 2001b), the excitation decreases with distance from\nthe Arches Cluster and Quintuplet Cluster, respectively, as expected for photoionization.\nHowever, the radial velocity structure of both gas and stars in this region is complex, and\nthere could be substantial line-of-sight distances between the star clusters and the ionized gas.\nThe Arched Filaments have radial velocities ranging from \u223c \u221225 km s\u22121 at the northern end\nto \u223c \u221240 km s\u22121 closest to Sgr A with occasional VLSR \u223c 0 km s\u22121 at intermediate locations\n(Lang et al. 2001). At many locations the observed lines show more than one velocity\ncomponent. Because negative radial velocities are contrary to the direction of Galactic\nrotation, Lang et al. (2001) suggested that the gas is moving on an elongated orbit in the\nGalaxy's barred spiral potential. The gas of the Sickle has an even larger range of velocities\nwith VLSR ranging from \u223c \u221240 km s\u22121 to \u223c 140 km s\u22121 (Yusef-Zadeh et al. 1997; Lang\net al. 1997). Unlike the Arched Filaments, the average VLSR of the Sickle is positive, \u223c 35\nkm s\u22121 (Lang et al. 1997). In both the Arched Filament and the Sickle regions, there exist\nmolecular clouds with velocities similar to those of the ionized gas (e.g., Serabyn & G\u00fcsten\n1987, 1991; Lang et al. 2002). The ionized gas is most likely the photoionized edges of these\nclouds (Lang et al. 2001).\nEven though it seems likely that the thermal gas in Fig. 1a is the photoionized edges\nof molecular clouds, the morphology seen in Fig. 1 suggests that the cloud structures are\nnot randomly placed in the GC. In particular, the systems of semi-circular arcs suggest that\nthe morphology has been influenced by stellar winds or supernova explosions. The most\nnotable pair of arcs has become known as the \"Bubble\" (Levine et al. 1999) or the \"Radio\nArc Bubble\" (Rodr\u0131\u0301guez-Fern\u00e1ndez et al. 2001b). This is the circular open structure south\nof the Quintuplet Cluster whose rim is faint at radio frequencies (Fig. 1a) but prominent in\nthe 21 \u03bcm continuum produced by warm dust (Fig. 1b, Egan et al. 1998; Price et al. 2001).\nAt the same position on the plane of the sky as the Bubble, there is a dense molecular\ncloud called either G0.11\u22120.11 (Tsuboi et al. 1997) or G0.13\u22120.13 (Oka et al. 2001). The\ncolumn densities through the cloud are so high that the cloud is optically thick even at midinfrared (MIR) wavelengths (AV \u223c 640 \u2212 740, Handa et al. 2006). In fact, the G0.11\u22120.11\ncloud is so optically thick that Handa et al. (2006) suggest that the dark area of the center\nof the Bubble is the shadow of the cloud. In this scenario the Bubble rim would be the\nilluminated exterior of the G0.11\u22120.11 cloud. We note, though, that there is no hint of such\nan optically thick cloud in the Spitzer Space Telescope IRAC images of the region (Stolovy\net al. 2006, 2007), at which wavelengths (3 \u2013 8 \u03bcm) the cloud would be even more optically\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nthick. We question whether the Bubble is in fact related to the G0.11\u22120.11 cloud. We\nsuspect the Bubble is a low density, interstellar bubble of hot shocked gas, lying between the\nEarth and the optically thick G0.11\u22120.11 cloud in the GC.\nIn this paper we present Spitzer Space Telescope observations (Program 3295, all AORs)\nof MIR spectra of 38 positions along a line approximately perpendicular to the Galactic\nplane in the GC. The observed line of positions is shown in Figure 1. The emission from\nthe 2 \u2013 3 positions at each end of the line probably originate in the diffuse interstellar\nmedium (ISM) along the line-of-sight to the GC as well as in the GC itself. Our goals are to\nclarify the source(s) of excitation of the Arched Filaments and the other thermal arcs and to\ndetermine the relationship of the Bubble to the clusters and other filament structures. We\ndefer discussion of the continuum features seen in the spectra and the spectra of the Arches\nCluster stars to later papers. In \u00a72 we present the observations; in \u00a73 we describe the results,\nincluding the gas excitation and atomic abundances; in \u00a74 we present the evidence for high\nvelocity shocks in the Bubble; in \u00a75 we discuss the origins of the shocked gas in the Bubble;\nand in \u00a76 we summarize our conclusions.\n\n2.\n\nObservations\n\nWe observed the Galactic Center region with the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) (Houck et\nal. 2004) on Spitzer Space Telescope (Werner et al. 2004) with the Short-High (SH, 10 \u2013 19.5\n\u03bcm) and Long-High (LH, 19.5 \u2013 38 \u03bcm) modules on 21 \u2013 23 March 2005. The LH spectra\nwere taken in the IRS Stare mode, where a position on the sky is observed for a number of\nintegrations (\"cycles\"), in this case four, and then displaced by a third the distance along\nthe slit for a second group of integration cycles. Since the SH slit is half the size of the LH\nslit (4.7\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 11.3\u2032\u2032 vs. 11.1\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 22.3\u2032\u2032 , respectively), the same position was mapped with the SH\nmodule in a 2 by 3 position map so that essentially the same area on the sky was covered.\nAs with LH, four or eight integrations (three for the Arches Cluster map positions) were\ntaken at each telescope pointing to provide redundancy against cosmic ray hits. The Arches\nCluster was mapped over a \u223c 45\u2032\u2032 square; however, for this paper we summed all the map\npositions so that the spectra are dominated by the interstellar gas and dust and not by the\ncluster stars (the most massive stars of the Arches Cluster are largely found in the central\n10\u2032\u2032 core, and > 80% in the central 20\u2032\u2032 , Stolte et al. 2002). For each telescope pointing, the\ntotal integration times ranged from 18 \u2013 120 s for SH and 24 \u2013 56 s for LH. The positions\nand integration times were chosen such that the bright lines would not saturate the sensitive\nIRS arrays; as a result, there is no spatial agreement with positions observed with any other\nIR telescope, such as the KAO or ISO. The coordinates of each of the 38 positions are given\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nin Table 1 and are plotted in Fig. 1.\nThe data were reduced and calibrated with the S13.2 pipeline at the Spitzer Science\nCenter (SSC). The basic calibrated data (bcd images) for each telescope pointing were\nmedian-combined and cleaned of rogue pixels1 and noisy order edges (the ends of the slit).\nThe spectra were extracted using both the Spectroscopic Modeling, Analysis and Reduction\nTool (SMART, Higdon et al. 2004) and the SSC extraction routines in the Spitzer IRS\nCustom Extraction tool (SPICE2 ); we use the SMART-extracted spectra in this paper (the\nresults from both spectrum extraction tools are similar). The LH spectra were defringed\nwith SMART and IRSFRINGE3 . Because the IRS was calibrated using point sources but all\nour sources (positions) are extended, a correction for the telescope diffraction pattern as a\nfunction of wavelength is necessary; these \"slitloss\" correction factors were taken from tables\nprovided with SPICE.\n\n2.1.\n\nSpectra and Line Fluxes\n\nThree examples of the observed spectra are shown in Figure 2 (corrections for offsets\nbetween the orders will be discussed by Simpson et al., in preparation); these positions are\nof the center of the Bubble (Fig. 2a), the W Arched Filament (Fig. 2b), and the position\nat the highest Galactic latitude (Fig. 2c). The three spectra are very representative of GC\nspectra of the Bubble, H II regions, and the diffuse ISM, respectively.\nFluxes for the faintest (noisiest) and brightest lines were estimated by integrating over\nthe line profiles (e.g., Colgan et al. 1996). These integrated fluxes are probably more\naccurate than the Gaussian fits where the line/continuum ratio > 1 since they require no\nassumptions about the shape of the line profile; the differences with Gaussian fits are less\nthan \u223c 1 \u2212 2% for these bright lines: [Ne II], [Ne III], [S III], and [Si II]. Line and continuum\nfluxes of all other lines were measured by fitting Gaussian profiles plus a linear continuum\nto each of the line profiles in the spectra using both IDL's CURVEFIT procedure and the\nprocedures in SMART (Higdon et al. 2004). The Gaussian fits should be more accurate\nwhen the line/continuum ratio < 1, since the continuum is fit simultaneously with the line.\nErrors for all fluxes were estimated by computing the root-mean-squared deviation of the\ndata from the fit; because of the systematic effects of low-level, uncorrectable rogue pixels on\n1\n\nhttp://ssc.spitzer.caltech.edu/irs/roguepixels\n\n2\n\nhttp://ssc.spitzer.caltech.edu/postbcd/spice.html\n\n3\n\nhttp://ssc.spitzer.caltech.edu/archanaly/contributed/irsfringe\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nthe spectra, these errors are consistently larger than errors estimated any other way, such as\nthe statistics of median averaging or the counting statistics plus read noise from the SSC's\npipeline. The lines discussed in this paper are listed in Table 2, along with references to\nthe atomic or molecular physics parameters (wavelengths, transition probabilities, collisional\ncross sections) needed for further analysis. The measured line fluxes are given in a machinereadable Table 3 and selected continuum fluxes (wavelengths containing no PAH emission\nfeatures) are given in a machine-readable Table 4, available in the on-line edition.\n\n2.2.\n\nExtinction\n\nIt is well known that the GC has \u223c 30 mag of visual extinction (see, e.g., Cotera et al.\n2000); this corresponds to an optical depth at 9.6 \u03bcm of \u03c49.6 \u223c 3 (Roche & Aitken 1985;\nSimpson et al. 1997). However, it is clear from looking at our extracted spectra and various\nline ratios (such as the [S III] 18.7/33.5 \u03bcm ratio) that the extinction is not constant for\nall positions. Unfortunately, because the spectra do not extend to wavelengths shorter than\n10 \u03bcm, we could not estimate \u03c49.6 by fitting extinction models to the data (e.g., Simpson\n& Rubin 1990). Instead, we estimate the extinction correction by assuming that all spectra\nhave essentially the same intrinsic shape given by the ratio of the 10 and 14 \u03bcm continuum\nfluxes (where there are no strong PAH features) and fitting that ratio with a template of the\nMIR fluxes measured in the Orion Nebula (Simpson et al. 1998) in this 10 \u2013 14 \u03bcm spectral\nregion. We will discuss this in more detail in our paper on the continuum features (Simpson\net al., in preparation). The law for the extinction versus wavelength for the GC of Chiar\n& Tielens (2006) was used to correct line fluxes at longer wavelengths (see Appendix A).\nThe extinction coefficients for each line as a fraction of the coefficient at 9.6 \u03bcm are given in\nTable 2.\n\n3.\n\nResults\n\nAs can be seen in Figure 3, the strengths of the ionized lines correlate well with the\nArches and Bubble structures seen in the radio (e.g., Fig. 1) and MIR continua (Egan et al.\n1998; Price et al. 2001). This is especially true of the lines that are strong in H II regions\n([Ne II] 12.8 \u03bcm, [Ne III] 15.6 \u03bcm, [S III] 18.7 and 33.5 \u03bcm, the [S III] lines not being plotted\nbecause they are very similar to the [Ne II] line). Lines prominent in photodissociation\nregions (PDRs) ([Si II] 34.8 \u03bcm and [Fe II] 26.0 \u03bcm) also peak in the Arched Filaments\nand the Bubble rim, but there is also some contribution from the diffuse ionized gas along\nthe line-of-sight to the GC. The 2 \u2013 3 positions at the ends of the line almost certainly\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nsample substantial amounts of foreground gas; however, we do not subtract these line fluxes\nas \"background\" because (1) this diffuse ionized gas is interesting in itself and (2) the half a\ndegree in Galactic latitude with the Galactic plane in the middle almost certainly precludes\nthe \"background\" from being uniform or flat.\n\n3.1.\n\nRadial Velocities\n\nEven though the resolution of the IRS SH and LH modules is only \u223c 500 km s\u22121 , as a\nresult of our high signal/noise ratios and the IRS stability the observed radial velocities of\nthe strongest lines have uncertainties as small as 10 \u2013 20 km s\u22121 . These uncertainties are\nestimated from the dispersion of the differences in velocities of two lines that should have the\nsame velocity at the same position, such as the two [S III] lines. These velocities are plotted\nin Figure 4. Because the wavelength calibration of the IRS is still incomplete, the velocities\nof the ionized lines were normalized to the radial velocity observed at Position 31 in the E2\nArched Filament by Lang et al. (2001, VLSR = \u221215 km s\u22121 ). The dotted line is the average\nvelocity of the four strongest ionized lines ([Si II], [Ne II], and [S III]); these velocities are\nlisted in Table 1.\nThe velocities of the H2 lines were normalized as follows: The CO J = 4 \u2013 3 intensities\nas a function of velocity and Galactic latitude were extracted from the data cube of CO\nmeasurements of Martin et al. (2004) at Galactic longitude 0.121\u25e6 . Intensity-weighted\naverage velocities were calculated for each latitude; these are plotted as a solid line in Fig. 4.\nOur H2 velocities were normalized by requiring that the average of all our H2 velocities be\nequal to the average of these CO velocities sampled at the same Galactic latitudes as our\ndata.\nThe excellent agreement of the strong, ionized lines shows that Spitzer can be used to\nmeasure relative radial velocities. Velocity gradients of as much as 5 \u2013 9 km s\u22121 arcsec\u22121\ncan even be seen in the [Ne II] and [S III] lines in a few of the SH 2 by 3 maps. The velocity\nof the weaker [Ne III] line is not as consistent - the line centroid is less well determined\nand the line may include a larger percentage of high-excitation diffuse ISM gas at a different\nvelocity.\nIn fact, there are indications of multiple velocity components in Bubble Positions 15,\n16, 19, 20, 21, and Bubble Rim Position 23. Not only are these the positions with velocity\ngradients in the SH ionized lines, the individual spectra for these positions have line widths\nsignificantly (25 \u2013 90 km s\u22121 ) larger than the instrumental line width, with Position 19 being\nthe most extreme (leading to deconvolved full widths at half maximum > 250 km s\u22121 ). Most\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nlikely, Bubble Position 18, which has one of the highest positive velocities in Fig. 4, is missing\nthe negative velocity components of the other Bubble positions and thus has relatively narrow\nlines. In general, the brighter lines are dominated by strong, single-velocity components and\nthus do not show any significant line broadening over the instrumental width.\nThe observed radial velocity pattern suggests that the Arched Filaments and Bubble\nrim structure have a substantial line-of-sight component to their distances. The average\nvelocity of the ionized lines (dotted in Fig. 4) shows significant structure on scales . 2 pc,\nwhereas the VLSR profile in the Arched Filaments is quite smooth. If the negative-velocity\ngas is in front of (behind) the positive-velocity gas, the negative-velocity Arched Filaments\nare closer to (farther from) the Sun than the positive-velocity, southern rim of the Bubble\n(Positions 10, 11, and 12). Position 20, with its large negative velocity, may be part of the\nnorthern rim of the Bubble. Some of these Bubble positions have broad lines, indicative of\nan average over both positive and negative velocity components. The fact that the Bubble\npositions (14 \u2013 21) sometimes have broad lines and sometimes do not (but instead have large\nabsolute velocities) is probably due to the ionized gas being clumpy. Positions 22 and 25\nmay be the southern extension of the Sickle (\"Sickle Handle\" in Table 1), since they have\npositive velocity like the Sickle (e.g., Lang et al. 1997; Simpson et al. 1997). If the apparent\nFilaments and Bubble structures are caused by a wind or explosion some time in the past,\none would expect the foreground components to have negative velocities due to expansion.\nIt would be interesting to see a complete map at higher spectral resolution of the velocities\nin the Bubble region since surely, the structure seen here is affected by the sample locations.\n\n3.2.\n\nMolecular Hydrogen and PDRs\n\nUnlike the ionized lines, the H2 line fluxes peak (Fig. 3a) near the Galactic plane\n(latitude \u223c \u22120.05\u25e6 ) and have a relatively flat intensity distribution with Galactic latitude,\nsimilar to the distribution seen in warm CO J = 4 \u2013 3 (Martin et al. 2004). The radial\nvelocities of the H2 lines also show a distinctly different pattern from those of the ionized\nlines (Fig. 4) (correlation coefficients < 0). This suggests that the warm molecular hydrogen\nis not associated with the same Arched Filament and Bubble structures that are seen in the\natomic lines and dust continuum. The H2 lines probably arise from numerous PDRs along\nthe line-of-sight to the GC as well as molecular clouds in the GC itself (see the Appendix).\nWe will leave additional discussion of the PDR properties of the molecular clouds to a later\npaper.\nHowever, we do note that the [Si II] lines (and the [Fe II] lines, although with poorer\nsignal/noise) show the same velocity structure (Fig. 4) as the ionized lines (correlation co-\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nefficients & 0.8), in addition to showing a similar intensity pattern (Fig. 3) (correlation\ncoefficients & 0.7). Hence, we ascribe these low-excitation ionized lines to the photoionized\ngas of the GC, rather than to the largely neutral gas associated with PDRs.\n\n3.3.\n\nElectron Temperatures\n\nComputations of H II region abundances require knowing the electron temperature,\nTe . Although the infrared forbidden lines have low sensitivity to Te (the forbidden line\nemissivities range from being proportional to Te\u22120.25 to Te\u22120.45 ), recombination lines are quite\nsensitive to Te - the emissivity of the H 7 \u2013 6 line is proportional to Te\u22121.3 . Measurements\nof Te have been published for the Arched Filaments by Lang et al. (2001). A typical value\nfor our Arched Filament positions is Te \u223c 6000 K. We adopt this value for all positions and\ninclude an estimated uncertainty of 500 K. In fact, we expect variations in Te and will discuss\nthe effects of other values of Te in later sections.\n\n3.4.\n\nElectron Densities and Corrections to the Estimated Extinction\n\nElectron densities, Ne , were estimated from the flux ratios of the density-sensitive [S III]\n18.7 and 33.5 \u03bcm lines (e.g., Rubin 1989; Simpson et al. 1995). The [S III] 18.7 to 33.5 \u03bcm\nflux ratio is also sensitive to extinction. For 8 positions the corrected 18.7/33.5 \u03bcm line ratio\n(\u00a72.2) is below that produced by even the lowest possible Ne , suggesting that an additional\nextinction correction is necessary. For these positions the estimated \u03c49.6 was increased by\n0.1 \u2013 0.9 until the [S III] 18.7/33.5 \u03bcm line ratio corresponded to a minimum Ne \u223c 10 cm\u22123 .\nThe estimated values of \u03c49.6 are listed in Table 1. Since both [S III] lines are very strong,\nthe chief uncertainty for Ne is due to uncertainties in the extinction correction. In order\nto include at least some of this extinction correction uncertainty in the error analysis, we\nassumed that the one sigma uncertainty in the optical depth is 10% of the value of \u03c49.6 in\nTable 1, multiplied by the factor appropriate for the wavelength of each line (\u03c4\u03bb /\u03c49.6 ) given\nin Table 2, and propagated this uncertainty through all succeeding ionic ratio calculations.\nThe computed densities are plotted in Figure 5. The highest density is at Position 31, the\nbrightest observed knot in the Arched Filaments.\nR\nTable 1 also contains the emission measure (= Ne2 dl) needed to produce the observed\nH 7 \u2013 6 recombination lines. These emission measures when combined with the minimum\nNe \u223c 10 cm\u22123 require path lengths of ionized gas \u223c 100 \u2212 500 pc. Such long path lengths\nare not unreasonable for the three end positions (1, 2, and 3) at negative Galactic latitudes\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nbut they may be an indication that at some positions, especially Positions 14 and 15 in the\nBubble, the minimum density, and hence the extinction, should be larger. For most of the\nrest of the positions, where Ne & 50 cm\u22123 , the pathlengths are only a few pc. From this we\ninfer that the gas emitting the ionized lines is clumpy, both within the Bubble and especially\nin the Arched Filaments.\n\n3.5.\n\nIonic and Total Abundance Ratios\n\nUsing the extinction-corrected fluxes and Ne shown in Fig. 5, we computed various\nionic ratios. The ratios (Ne+ + Ne++ )/H+ and (S++ + S+3 )/H+ are plotted in Figure 6.\nAlthough we would expect the Ne/H and S/H ratios to be constant, we see that neither ratio\nis constant for all Galactic latitudes. The usual explanation for variable abundance ratios\nin a single source is that some ionization state is not being counted - this is certainly the\ncase for the S/H ratio, as estimated by the (S++ + S+3 )/H+ ratio, where there could be\nsignificant unmeasured S+ . On the other hand, for H II regions we expect & 99% of the neon\nto be either singly or doubly ionized, and even in partially-ionized diffuse ISM we expect\nneon to be essentially as ionized as hydrogen. The sizable error bars are due almost entirely\nto the measurements of the relatively weak H 7 \u2013 6 line; the 500 K uncertainty in Te adds an\nadditional \u223c 10% to the error bars. We suggest that the reason for the apparent variations\nin the Ne/H abundances is our assumption of a constant Te = 6000 K. If we assumed much\nlower Te in the diffuse ISM for the positions away from the Arched Filaments, we would\nderive a much more constant (Ne+ + Ne++ )/H+ ratio. For example, decreasing the assumed\nTe from 6000 K to 3000 K would increase the derived (Ne+ + Ne++ )/H+ abundance ratio\nby a factor of \u223c 2.1 (and the (S++ + S+3 )/H+ abundance ratio by a factor of \u223c 1.9). Since\nthe extinction coefficients for the H 7 \u2013 6 and [Ne II] lines are almost identical (Table 2), the\nNe+ /H+ ratio is not sensitive to extinction uncertainties.\nBecause of the uncertainty in Te and the need for correction for S+ in the diffuse ISM\npositions, we compute total abundances only for the Arched Filament positions. These\npositions are chosen because they should require the least correction for S+ . Here the\nSi+ /(Ne+ + Ne++ ) ratio is particularly low (Fig. 6c), from which we infer that silicon is\nmostly doubly ionized or more, as should be sulfur. For Positions 29 \u2013 34 we find the average Ne/H= 1.63 \u00b1 0.08 \u00d7 10\u22124 , the average S/H= 1.16 \u00b1 0.06 \u00d7 10\u22125, and Ne/S= 13.6 \u00b1 1.1.\nThese values of Ne/H and S/H are both about 1.6 \u00b1 0.1 times that of the Orion Nebula\n(Simpson et al. 2004, 1998). We note that with updated cross sections (Table 2; Chiar &\nTielens 2006) and extinction (Cotera et al. 2000), the S++ /H+ ratio measured by Simpson et\nal. (1995) for G0.095+0.012, which is part of the Arched Filaments, is now 1.8 \u00b1 0.3 \u00d7 10\u22125 ,\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nsuch that S/H\u223c 2.0 \u00d7 10\u22125 , after correction for S+ and S+3 .\nSimpson & Rubin (1990), Simpson et al. (1995), Afflerbach et al. (1997), and Mart\u0131\u0301nHern\u00e1ndez et al. (2002) showed that the gradients of abundances with respect to hydrogen\nextend all the way into the GC. Their observed gradients for Ne/H and S/H ranged from\n\u22120.039 to \u22120.086 dex kpc\u22121 , with a weighted average of \u22120.059 dex kpc\u22121 . However,\nthe Orion Nebula has a Galactocentric distance of \u223c 8.4 kpc, thus making our observed\nArched Filament/Orion Nebula ratio of 1.6 correspond to a gradient of only \u22120.025 dex\nkpc\u22121 . Simpson et al. (1995) suggested that the gradient is flatter in the inner Galaxy\ndue to the influence of the inner Galaxy bar producing radial mixing. On the other hand,\nthere are variations in the chemical composition of the GC that may show that the gas is\nnot well-mixed. Rodr\u0131\u0301guez-Fern\u00e1ndez & Mart\u0131\u0301n-Pintado (2005) observed the H II region\nlines at a number of positions with the ISO spectrometers. Their measured Ne/H and S/H\nratios (2 \u2212 4 \u00d7 10\u22124 and 8 \u2212 30 \u00d7 10\u22126, respectively) are mostly larger than our measured\nratios; however, their values include large uncertainties due to extinction and to the different\naperture sizes at the wavelengths of Br\u03b1 and the Ne and S lines.\n\n3.6.\n\nSources of Excitation\n\nThe H II region excitation can be estimated from the flux ratio of a doubly ionized\nline to a singly ionized line of the same element if the ionization potentials of both lines are\ngreater than that of hydrogen (13.6 eV). For Spitzer, the best line pair is the [Ne III] 15.6 \u03bcm\nand [Ne II] 12.8 \u03bcm lines, since both lines have similar extinction. The excitation determined\nfrom the [S IV] 10.5 and [S III] 18.7 and 33.5 \u03bcm lines is less reliable because of the high\nextinction at 10 \u03bcm in the GC. The excitation ratios of Ne and S are plotted in Figure 7.\nThe excitation of an H II region decreases with distance from the exciting stars, both\nbecause there is absorption of the high energy photons by gas closer to the stars (resulting in\nsmaller Str\u00f6mgren spheres for the higher ionization species) and because the radiation field\nis more dilute at larger distances. The latter effect is seen where the H II region consists of\nclumps of gas at varying distances from the star with no gas interior to absorb the high energy\nphotons. This case is usually described as having a low value of the ionization parameter\nU, where U is defined as the ratio of the photon density and the electron density and is\nproportional to the photoionization rate divided by the recombination rate. The effect of a\ndilute radiation field is that the doubly and triply ionized ions tend to recombine to lower\nionization states even if the ionizing stellar spectral energy distribution (SED) is hard enough\nthat most ions are at least doubly ionized in ordinary, compact H II regions. Good examples\nare the ions of silicon and sulfur, which are normally at least doubly ionized in H II regions\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\n(the singly ionized states commonly occur in PDRs). Noticeable amounts of the singly\nionized states of these elements occur when log U . \u22122, regardless of the exciting SED.\nConsequently, there can be gas that is simultaneously high-excitation (containing doubly\nand triply ionized atoms) due to high-energy photons of the stellar SED (or shocks) but\ncontains substantial numbers of singly-ionized atoms due to excessive recombination at low\nU.\nWe can test for changes in the excitation due to distance from the exciting stars by\nobservations of singly ionized silicon. The Si+ /Ne ratio is shown in Fig. 6c but an even\nbetter test is the [Si II] 34.8/[S III] 33.5 \u03bcm line ratio, because it has little dependence on\nNe , Te , or extinction. Simpson et al. (1997) discussed this effect for models with varying\nU, which they compared to observations of the gas in the Sickle surrounding the Quintuplet\nCluster. Figure 8 shows the [Si II] 34.8/[S III] 33.5 \u03bcm line ratio for the GC positions. For\nmodels of compact, spherical H II regions, this ratio ranges from \u223c 0.1 \u2212 0.3 (Simpson et al.\n1997), and for observed H II regions, from \u223c 0.1 to \u223c 0.6 (Simpson et al. 1997; M. R. Haas,\nprivate communication). From Figure 8 we infer that for all the positions with the [Si II]\n34.8/[S III] 33.5 \u03bcm line ratio > 0.7, the gas lies at substantial distances from the exciting\nstars.\nWe can use this apparent decrease in excitation with distance from a potential source\nof ionizing photons to help identify the actual ionizing stars. Because the Arched Filament\nPositions 29 \u2013 34 have [Si II] 34.8/[S III] 33.5 \u03bcm line ratios (Fig. 8) typical of compact H II\nregions, they must be ionized by stars relatively nearby. These stars must be the Arches\nCluster stars and not the much more distant Quintuplet Cluster stars. The neon and sulfur\nexcitation (Fig. 7a and 7b) decreases as one looks to higher Galactic latitude from the Arches\nCluster as would be expected if these filaments are ionized by the Arches Cluster and are\nphysically more distant. Because the gas at the position (28) of the Arches Cluster itself has\nlower excitation than the two positions at immediately higher Galactic latitudes, we believe\nthat the Arches Cluster lies some distance away from the gas emitting the observed lines (see\nalso Cotera et al. 2005 and Lang et al. 2001). Since the gas at Positions 22 \u2013 26 has higher\nexcitation yet (Fig. 7), we believe that this gas is excited by the Quintuplet Cluster and\nnot the Arches Cluster. These positions also have radial velocities (\u00a73.1) more in agreement\nwith the Quintuplet Cluster and Sickle than with the Arched Filaments.\nWe show now that the hot stars of the Quintuplet Cluster almost certainly ionize the\nrims of the Bubble. A question that motivated this project was whether the southern side of\nthe Bubble rim might be ionized by hot stars lying outside the G0.11\u22120.11 molecular cloud\nto the south. We find no indication of hot stars at more southerly latitudes than the Bubble\n- such stars would produce doubly ionized Si and probably Ne. However, we observed that\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nthe [Si II] 34.8/[S III] 33.5 \u03bcm line ratio is high in the rim, indicating that the exciting stars\nlie at some large distance, and the Ne++ /Ne+ ratio steadily decreases with distance from the\nQuintuplet Cluster. The region near the Sickle is probably also ionized by the Quintuplet\nCluster with the possible exception of very low-excitation Position 20, the same position\nthat has the anomalously negative radial velocity of Fig. 4. Or it may be that Position 20 is\nalso ionized by the Quintuplet Cluster but has a large line-of-sight separation from it.\nWe have used the photoionization code CLOUDY (version 07.02.00, last described by\nFerland et al. 1998) to estimate the ionization structure of clumps of gas offset from the\nQuintuplet Cluster at distances ranging from 0.01 to 25 pc. We assumed empty space\nbetween the gas clumps and the exciting stars. The models used the 36 kK supergiant\natmosphere of Sternberg et al. (2003), abundances equal to two times those of the Orion\nNebula (Simpson et al. 2004), Ne = 316 cm\u22123 , and 1050.9 ionizing photons per second. The\nresults for the integrated Ne++ /(Ne+ + Ne++ ) and S+3 /(S++ + S+3 ) ratios are plotted in\nFigure 9; also plotted are the ratios for Positions 4 \u2013 26 where the abscissa is the distance of\nthe position from the Quintuplet Cluster on the plane of the sky. We see that the observed\nNe++ /(Ne+ + Ne++ ) ratios (Fig. 9a) agree reasonably well with the models, the differences\nprobably being due to the need for some additional line-of-sight contribution to the distance.\nAlthough the S+3 /(S++ + S+3 ) ratios (Fig. 9b) also decrease with distance, the model ratios\ndecrease much more steeply than the observations. The factor of \u223c 4 discrepancy in the S+3\nfraction between the observations of positions in the Bubble rim and the models cannot be\ndue to an overcorrection for extinction, since the Bubble rim has typically \u03c49.6 . 2, which\nproduces a correction of e2\u22170.777 = 4.66 at 10.5 \u03bcm.\nThe temperature of the warm dust also decreases with distance from the Quintuplet\nCluster, as is shown in Figure 9c. Calculations of the emission from interstellar dust grains\nare usually made as a function of \u03c7, the ratio of the impinging radiation field divided by the\n\"local interstellar radiation field\". Li & Draine (2001) and Draine & Li (2007) calculated\nthe emission spectrum of dust grains under conditions where \u03c7 ranged from 0.3 to 104 . They\nfind that the spectrum . 25 \u03bcm shows little variation with changes in the radiation field\nintensity until \u03c7 > 103 , because for these wavelengths at the lower \u03c7, the emission mostly\narises from single-photon heating of very small carbon grains. For \u03c7 & 103 , the 18.7/33.5 \u03bcm\ncontinuum ratio increases substantially with increasing \u03c7 because there is now a contribution\nfrom larger, steady-state grains. Since \u03c7 is observed to be > 104 in the Sickle (Simpson et\nal. 1997), it is reasonable to expect that the positions closest to the Quintuplet Cluster are\nin the regime of high enough radiation field intensity to affect the 18.7/33.5 \u03bcm ratio. The\n18.7/33.5 \u03bcm ratio appears to flatten out at large distances from the Quintuplet Cluster\nbecause \u03c7 is now < 103 .\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nRodr\u0131\u0301guez-Fern\u00e1ndez et al. (2001b) showed that the excitation of both the nitrogen and\nneon lines decreases with distance from the Quintuplet Cluster by comparing their ISO line\nmeasurements with CLOUDY models. Most of their observations were of the Sickle region\nbetween the Quintuplet and Arches Clusters, but they did have five positions in the Bubble\nrim. Our observations, made with the great sensitivity of Spitzer, show that the influence of\nthe Quintuplet Cluster extends well beyond the inner edge of the Bubble rim and includes\nheating the dust as well as ionizing the gas.\n\n4.\n\nHigh Velocity Shocks\n\nFigure 7 shows that the highest excitation occurs in the interior of the Bubble region\nand in the diffuse ISM at the ends of the line of positions. Surprisingly, the highest excitation\ndoes not occur close to either cluster - either there is some additional source of excitation in\nthe Bubble or the gas at the positions closest to the Quintuplet Cluster actually has a large\nline-of-sight distance to the cluster. We suggest here that the source of the high excitation\ngas may be high velocity shocks in the Bubble.\n\n4.1.\n\nTriply Ionized Oxygen\n\nBecause photons that can doubly ionize helium (> 54.4 eV) are required for production\nof O+3 (IP = 54.9 eV), triply ionized oxygen should not be produced in Galactic H II\nregions except those ionized by the most massive O stars. However, the [O IV] 25.89 \u03bcm line\nis detected at almost every position that we observed. The exceptions (observed signal/noise\n< 3) occur, not where the line is weak, but where the continuum, with its noise-producing\nrogue pixels, is very strong. The normalized line profiles that show this line are plotted in\nFigure 10. Fluxes in the LH beam (248 square arcsec) with > 3\u03c3 measurements range from\n2.1 \u00d7 10\u221217 W m\u22122 to 1.5 \u00d7 10\u221216 W m\u22122 . The peak fluxes occur in Positions 19 \u2013 27 but\nthe best signal/noise is for positions in the Bubble and the diffuse ISM at high Galactic\nlatitudes where the line/continuum ratio is the largest. We plot the O+3 /(Ne+ + Ne++ )\nratio in Figure 11. Since the O/Ne ratio, which is expected to be approximately constant,\nis observed to equal \u223c 4 in Galactic H II regions and O+3 /(Ne+ + Ne++ ) is < 0.01 here, we\nsee that very little of the oxygen is O+3 and therefore very little neon should be in higher\nionization stages, too.\nAlthough triply ionized oxygen should not be produced in Galactic H II regions, it has, in\nfact, been detected in some extra-galactic H II regions. However, either these are extremely\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nlow metallicity, which hardens the stellar ionizing SED, or the exciting stars include hot\nWR stars (Schaerer & Stasi\u0144ska 1999). This is not the case in the GC - we observe no\nenhancement of the O+3 /(Ne+ + Ne++ ) ratio at the position of the Arches Cluster, indicating\nthat its WR stars are not effective at producing O+3 .\nLutz et al. (1998) discussed the [O IV] that they had observed with ISO in some galactic\nnuclei that are not low metallicity. They attempted to reproduce the [Ne III]/[Ne II] and\n[O IV]/([Ne II] + 0.44[Ne III]) line ratios using CLOUDY (Ferland et al. 1998). They\nmodeled both a weak active galactic nucleus embedded in a starburst and an H II region\nionized by main-sequence stars plus a hot (80 kK) blackbody to represent WR stars. All\ntheir models showed the same pattern: in order to produce as much [O IV] emission as\nis observed, they had to include so much of the hot component that the [Ne III]/[Ne II]\nratio was much larger than observed. They noted that if there were small regions producing\nrelatively strong [O IV] intermixed with low excitation gas, they might be able to produce the\nobserved ratios; however, they considered it unlikely because they knew of no such regions\nin the Galaxy or 30 Dor, and planetary nebulae produce too small a contribution to be\ndetected. They suggested that the high excitation of [O IV] is caused by shocks.\nWe have used most recent version of CLOUDY (07.02.00) to make similar models,\nemploying both black bodies and the supergiant SEDs of Sternberg et al. (2003), who used\nthe WM-BASIC model atmosphere code of Pauldrach et al. (2001). Supergiant models are\ndefined here as the atmosphere models with the smallest gravity, g, for each stellar effective\ntemperature, Teff . Supergiant SEDs are used because H II region models computed with these\nSEDs as input give substantially better agreement with observed Ne++ lines than the WMBASIC SEDs with other gravities or computed with other model atmosphere codes (Simpson\net al. 2004; Rubin et al. 2007). We emphasize that even though the actual stars may be\nsomething other than supergiants, the integrated cluster SEDs are similar to the calculated\nsupergiant model SEDs. The CLOUDY models have as input density = 316 cm\u22123 ; Sternberg\net al. SEDs with Teff = 32 kK to 50 kK; number of ionizing photons NLyc = 1049 , 1050 , and\n1051 s\u22121 ; and inner shell radius Ri = 0.01, 1.0, and 10 pc. The blackbody models have Teff =\n30 kK to 45 kK and similar other parameters. Many of the CLOUDY models with blackbody\nSEDs have additional blackbody components with Teff = 105 and/or 106 K to represent hot\nWR stars or the pervasive X-ray flux of the GC.\nFigure 12 shows the fraction of O+3 versus the fraction of Ne++ for both the H II region\nmodels and our observations. The only models using Sternberg et al. (2003) atmospheres\n(open circles) with enough O+3 to show up on this plot are the two models with Teff = 50\nkK, NLyc = 1049 s\u22121 , and Ri = 0.01 or 1.0 pc (since star clusters containing multiple 50 kK\nstars are not likely in the Galaxy, no models with 50 kK atmospheres and larger NLyc were\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\ncomputed). The asterisks are the blackbodies with additional hot components for WR stars\nand X-rays. As was earlier shown by Lutz et al. (1998), all the data fall to the upper left\n(larger O+3 /Ne++ ) with respect to all the models calculated with believable SEDs (asterisks\nand open circles).\nBefore leaving this topic we test whether there is any SED that could be used in an\nH II region model that would reproduce the observed ionic ratios. To do this we computed\nmodels with the Sternberg et al. (2003) SED for 36 kK, (which has a sharp drop-off at 54.4\neV), but we arbitrarily increased the flux for photon energies E > 54.5 eV (> 4.013 ryd).\nThe other inputs were Ri = 10 pc and log NLyc = 50.5. Such SEDs do not affect ionic ratios\nof low-excitation ions, unlike SEDs where the flux at 54.5 eV is increased by the addition of a\nblackbody, which has substantial photon emission at energies lower than its maximum. The\nionic ratios from these models are plotted as open triangles in Fig. 12. The lowest triangle\non this plot is from the model that has a jump in the SED of \u223c 4 orders of magnitude going\nfrom 54 eV to 54.5 eV. In this model the SED is increased by a factor of 109 over the original\nvery low flux with E > 54.5 eV found in Sternberg et al's model atmospheres. The open\ntriangles connected by the solid line have an increase of a factor of 1010 over the original\nSED; their values of Ri are 2, 5, 10, and 15 pc (top to bottom). We see that the only model\nlying in the area of the observations is the model with Ri = 10 pc and a SED with a flux\njump of a factor of \u223c 105 at 54.5 eV. SEDs with other flux jumps and Ri could probably\nfit, but if the SED represents the ionizing source of all the positions, which all have different\nRi , it would not be possible for the same SED to fit all positions. Moreover, it is difficult to\nimagine a physical process that would produce such strong emission in the He++ continuum\n> 54.5 eV when the normal stellar SED has deep absorption. We conclude that the O+3 is\nnot produced by photoionization.\nThe advantage of observing [O IV] in the GC is that we can locate the maximum of the\nhigh-excitation gas as being in a region that does not appear to contain the exciting stars.\nWe also can eliminate any possibility that the [O IV] is confined to small but high excitation\nregions as we detected it at all our positions. According to the shock models of Contini &\nViegas (2001), a shock velocity \u223c 100 km s\u22121 is adequate to produce the amount of [O IV]\nthat is observed.\n\n4.2.\n\nGas-Phase Iron Production in Shocks\n\nWhereas O+3 could be produced by high energy photons such as X-rays, high gas-phase\nabundances of elements normally depleted onto grains indicate grain destruction in shocks.\nHere we demonstrate that the gas-phase iron abundance is greatly increased in the center of\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\nthe Bubble compared to the surrounding gas. This is suggestive of shock production.\nTo compute the Fe abundance ratios we modeled the Fe+ and Fe++ ions with 36 and\n34 level statistical equilibrium calculations, respectively (see Table 2 for atomic parameters\nand references). Figure 10 shows the observed [Fe II] lines and Figure 13 shows the derived\n(Fe+ + Fe++ )/(Ne+ + Ne++ ) ratio. Here we have plotted ratios computed using both the\n[Fe II] 25.99 \u03bcm line and the [Fe II] 17.94 \u03bcm line since the former includes substantial\nemission from the low temperature PDRs along the line-of-sight (e.g., Kaufman et al. 2006)\nbut the lower level of the latter is 1873 cm\u22121 above ground and the line should arise only in\nthe H II region gas, like the [Fe III], [Ne II], and [Ne III] lines. Unfortunately, the [Fe II] 17.94\n\u03bcm line is weak and is somewhat blended with the [P III] 17.885 \u03bcm line (Fig. 10a). With\nthe Spitzer resolution of \u223c 600, the lines are separated by \u223c 1.7 resolution elements and so\ncan usually be distinguished; however, the measurements have some additional uncertainty\nbecause the 2-line-Gaussian-fit routines in SMART would converge only if the line width was\nfixed at the Spitzer IRS SH resolution. There are two other [Fe II] lines in the LH bandpass\nbut they are either in a very noisy part of the wavelength range (35.35 \u03bcm) or in a region\nwith bad fringing (24.52 \u03bcm). The latter line is usually detectable, but since its signal/noise\nratio is much worse than the 17.94 \u03bcm line, we do not use it. The [Fe III] 33.04 \u03bcm line also\nis usually detectable (Fig. 2a), but since it imparts no additional information with respect to\nNe or Te and its signal/noise ratio is so much poorer than the 22.9 \u03bcm line that the 33.0/22.9\nline ratio is not usable for extinction estimates, we do not use it either.\nWe estimate the gas-phase abundances of iron in the GC by using our observed (Fe+ +\nFe++ )/(Ne+ + Ne++ ) ratios (Fig. 13): (Fe+ + Fe++ )/(Ne+ + Ne++ )= 0.0066 \u00b1 0.0016 in the\nArched Filaments and (Fe+ + Fe++ )/(Ne+ + Ne++ )= 0.043 \u00b1 0.004 in the Bubble. Since\nFe++ is moderately-low excitation, there can be substantial Fe+3 in photoionized H II regions\n(see Rodr\u0131\u0301guez & Rubin 2005 for a discussion of the uncertainties in the measurements of Fe\nabundances in H II regions). We estimate the correction for Fe+3 using both the CLOUDY\nmodels described above and models computed with the code NEBULA (Simpson et al.\n2004; Rubin et al. 2007), noting that NEBULA and CLOUDY produce similar results for\nthe same SEDs and other input parameters. The ionization fractions computed with these\nmodels are plotted in Figure 14. As explained above, we prefer the models computed with\nthe supergiant atmospheres of Sternberg et al. (2003), which are connected with the heavy\nsolid line in the plot; from these we estimate an ionization correction factor of \u223c 20%. This\ngives the gas-phase (Fe/Ne)gas = 0.0082 and 0.054 in the Arched Filaments and Bubble,\nrespectively. Assuming that the Ne/H ratio observed in the Arched Filaments (Ne/H =\n1.63 \u00d7 10\u22124 ) is applicable to all the GC gas and that Ne is not condensed onto grains, by\nmultiplying (Fe/Ne)gas by Ne/H we estimate that (Fe/H)gas \u223c 1.3 \u00d7 10\u22126 in the Arched\nFilaments and \u223c 8.8 \u00d7 10\u22126 in the Bubble. There is an increase in the gas-phase abundance\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\nof Fe of a factor of 6.5 \u00b1 1.7 in the Bubble with respect to the surrounding gas.\nIn order to estimate the depletion factors for Fe in the GC, one first needs to know the\ntotal Fe abundance in both grains and gas. There are several ways to do this:\n(1) There are interstellar absorption lines of O, Ne, and Fe from 13.4 \u2013 23.5 \u00c5 that can\nbe observed by Chandra and XMM-Newton. The advantage of X-ray measurements is that\nthe atoms in the grains produce sufficient absorption that total abundances are measured,\nnot just gas phase abundances. Using Chandra, Juett et al. (2006) observed absorption lines\nand edges in front of 7 neutron stars, measuring averages of O/Ne = 5.4 \u00b1 1.6 and Fe/Ne\n= 0.20 \u00b1 0.03 (unfortunately, this soft X-ray wavelength range suffers too much interstellar\nextinction for observations of GC sources). They derive the expression\n(Fe/Ne)ISM = (Fe/Ne)meas /(1 \u2212 \u03b2 + f \u03b2)\n\n(1)\n\nto correct for optical depth effects in the larger grains, where (Fe/Ne)ISM is the total gas\nplus grains ratio, (Fe/Ne)meas is the measured average ratio given above, \u03b2 is the fraction of\nFe residing in grains, and f is the factor accounting for grain optical depths and the grain\nsize distribution. They derive f = 0.88 for Fe and f = 0.90 for O. Using eq. (1) we find that\n(Fe/Ne)ISM ranges from 0.20 to 0.23 and (O/Ne)ISM ranges from 5.4 to 6.1 for 0 < \u03b2 < 1.\nSo that they would not need to make corrections for grains, Yao et al. (2006) measured\nhigh ionization absorption lines of Ne and Fe in the low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1820\u2212303,\nwith the results that O/Ne = 6.2 and Fe/Ne = 0.30.\n(2) There are X-ray emission lines of Fe at 6.4 and 6.7 keV. Wang et al. (2006) measured\nthe spectra of the Arches Cluster stars with Chandra. From the 6.7 keV line - which probes\nhighly ionized gas in the shocked cluster winds - they estimated that the Fe abundance\nis 1.8 times Solar, referring to the Solar abundances of Anders & Grevesse (1989), or Fe/H\n= 8.4 \u00d7 10\u22125 . From measurements of the spectrum of the diffuse emission surrounding the\nArches Cluster with Suzaku, Tsujimoto et al. (2007) estimated that the abundance of Fe\nis Solar, again with respect to the abundance summary of Anders & Grevesse, such that\nFe/H\u223c 5 \u00d7 10\u22125 . Koyama et al. (2007), using Suzaku, estimated an average Fe column\ndensity= 9.7 \u00d7 1018 cm\u22122 for the diffuse gas in the GC, from which they calculated that\nthe iron abundance is Fe/H\u223c 1.6 \u00d7 10\u22124 , assuming that the column density of H is 6 \u00d7 1022\ncm\u22122 . For these iron abundances, we estimate Fe/Ne\u223c 0.5, 0.3, or 1.0, respectively.\n(3) By observing the spectra of cool stars in the GC, Ram\u0131\u0301rez et al. (2000) and Blum\net al. (2003) found that the abundance of iron in the GC central cluster is \u223c Solar. From\nthe spectra of hot stars in the central cluster and the Quintuplet cluster, Najarro (2006)\nalso found a Solar abundance of iron. These results are in contradiction to the computations\ngiving a steep gradient for Fe in the Galaxy (e.g., Cescutti et al. 2007). The most recent\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\ncompilation of Solar abundances is that of Asplund et al. (2005), who give Fe/H= 2.8\u00d710\u22125 .\nFrom this we estimate that the total Fe/Ne\u223c 0.17.\nIn summary, estimates of the total Fe/Ne ratio in the GC range from \u223c 0.17 to \u223c 1.0.\nWith these estimates (0.17/0.30/1.0) of the Fe/Ne ratio and our measurements, we find that\nthe fraction of Fe in the gas phase is 0.048/0.027/0.0082 and 0.32/0.18/0.054 for the Arched\nFilaments and the Bubble, respectively. Thus, in spite of the factor of 6.5 increase of gasphase iron in the Bubble with respect to the surrounding ISM, most Fe is still incorporated\nin grains and is not in the gas-phase.\nDust grains can be destroyed in shocks, both by grains shattering into smaller particles\nand being vaporized in grain-grain collisions and by removal of individual atoms by photons\nand by high-velocity gas (see Jones 2004 for a review). In high velocity shocks, Vs > 200\nkm s\u22121 , the grains are stopped in the hot gas. Since in hot gas H+ and He+ have the\nsame kinetic energies (\u223c 32 kT ) but H+ is more abundant, sputtering by protons dominates.\nIn slower shocks, however, most of the destruction is done by the betatron acceleration of\ngrains, which then move at high speeds (\u223c Vs ) through the gas. For this case, the collision\nvelocity is the same for H+ and He++ , and since the He ions have 4 times the energy of the\nprotons, they dominate the sputtering, even though they are less abundant by a factor of\nten.\nJones et al. (1994, 1996) computed grain destruction models for a variety of shock\nvelocities, initial densities n0 , and magnetic fields B0 . Both n0 and B0 in the GC are\nprobably higher than those used in any of their models (especially B0 ) but the destruction\n\u22121/2\nrate should scale as B0 n0 . The observed depletions in the Bubble correspond to shock\nvelocities \u223c 100 \u2212 50 km s\u22121 , depending on which Fe gas-phase fraction is correct. These\nvelocities are plausible if the shocks are due to the expansion of the Bubble (see the range\nof velocities in Table 1).\nWe note that there is no obvious increase in the Si+ /H+ ratio in the Bubble compared to\nthe Bubble exterior that cannot be attributed to normal H II region photoionization, where\nmost Si is Si++ or higher. In the Bubble the average Si+ /(Ne+ +Ne++ )= 0.102 \u00b1 0.003, from\nwhich we estimate that Si+ /H\u223c 1.7 \u00d7 10\u22125 . This is about 0.5 times Solar (e.g., Asplund et\nal. 2005). However, if one of the higher depletion estimates for Fe is correct, it would require\nonly a small fraction of the grains to be destroyed in the Bubble, producing a non-detectable\nincrease in the gas-phase Si abundance.\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\n5.\n\nDiscussion\n\nBubbles around hot stars and star clusters are commonly observed in other galaxies\n(e.g., Oey & Massey 1994; Oey 1996) and in the Milky Way (Churchwell et al. 2006). Early\nanalytic models were made by Weaver et al. (1977), who modeled the time-varying stellar\nwind of a main-sequence star expanding into the ISM. Later, Garc\u0131\u0301a-Segura & Mac Low\n(1995a, 1995b) made both analytic and numerical models of stellar winds from WR stars.\nWhen these winds encounter gas from previous mass-loss episodes (main-sequence and red\nsuper-giant stages) and/or interstellar gas, a shock results, producing high temperatures and\nhence high pressures. A shell is formed surrounding the high-pressure interior; the expanding\nshell sweeps up the exterior interstellar gas, shocking and heating it. The temperatures\nof the lower-density bubble interior are sufficiently high that, at least sometimes, X-rays\nare produced (Chu & Mac Low 1990). Although these models do predict the formation of\nbubbles, Oey (1996) found that the predicted bubbles are much larger than observed. Oey &\nGarc\u0131\u0301a-Segura (2004) found that numerical hydrodynamic and radiative models that include\nsubstantial pressure, P/k \u223c 105 cm\u22123 K, in the ambient ISM result in bubbles and shells\nmuch more similar in size to the observed bubbles.\nThe Bubble seen in the GC is fairly small (radius \u223c 10 pc) compared to the bubbles\nin the Large Magellanic Cloud observed by Oey (1996) and Oey & Garc\u0131\u0301a-Segura (2004).\nOn the other hand, the ambient ISM pressure in the GC is probably at least an order of\nmagnitude larger - for the GC as a whole, Spergel & Blitz (1992) estimate P/k \u223c 5 \u00d7 106\ncm\u22123 K. Rodr\u0131\u0301guez-Fern\u00e1ndez et al. (2001a) measured CO lines with the IRAM 30 m\ntelescope and H2 lines with ISO at their position M+0.16\u22120.10 in the center of the Bubble.\nThey estimated an H2 density of \u223c 104 cm\u22123 from their CO measurements and a temperature\nof 157 \u2212 900 K from their H2 line measurements, giving P/k = nT \u223c few \u00d7106 cm\u22123 K.\nThis gas is most likely found in a PDR, probably the edge of the molecular clouds in this\nregion. The turbulent pressure must be large, given that the H2 line widths (180 km s\u22121 )\nare much larger than the sound speed. Possibly the largest contributor to the ISM pressure\nis the magnetic field, B. Yusef-Zadeh & Morris (1987a) suggested that the magnetic field\nin the linear non-thermal filaments of the Radio Arc is as high as 1 mG. If so, the magnetic\n2\npressure (PB /k = 2.9 \u00d7 108 BmG\ncm\u22123 K) dominates the gas pressure, although it would be\nfound in both the interior and the exterior of the Bubble. If the linear filaments do not\nthread through the Bubble, B could be much lower. LaRosa et al. (2005) found that the\nglobal field of the GC is only of order 10 \u03bcG with an upper limit of . 100 \u03bcG. Since the\nmagnetic pressure is proportional to B 2 , the global magnetic pressure, in this case, would\nnot contribute significantly to the ambient ISM pressure.\nLooking at the models of Oey & Garc\u0131\u0301a-Segura (2004), we suspect that similar models\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\nwith ambient ISM pressure & 106 cm\u22123 K could produce bubbles with radii of order 10 \u2013\n20 pc, such as are observed in the high-pressure environment of the GC. The star clusters\nproducing the bubbles in their models have ionizing luminosities NLyc = 1049.4 \u2212 1050.2 s\u22121\n(we include here only their \"Pre-SN\" clusters because these bubbles have thicker observed\nshells like the Bubble and not the very thin shells of \"Post-SN\" clusters). The Quintuplet\nCluster lies within the Bubble, although not at its center, and has NLyc \u223c 1050.9 photons s\u22121\nand \u1e40 & 7 \u00d7 10\u22124 M\u2299 yr\u22121 (Lang et al. 2005). Since the sizes of observed expanding shells\nare always much smaller than what is expected from the kinetic energy of the stellar wind, we\nspeculate that the Bubble is produced by the Quintuplet Cluster. The Bubble asymmetry\nis probably caused by the asymmetry in the surrounding molecular clouds, such that the\nQuintuplet Cluster is close to the cloud next to the Sickle (Simpson et al. 1997). Before the\nCluster wind started creating the Bubble, there was a gradient in the gas extending from\nthe VLSR = +25 km s\u22121 G0.20\u22120.033 molecular cloud (Serabyn & G\u00fcsten 1991) through the\nlocation of the stars to lower Galactic latitudes.\nWe can ask about the extent of the shocked gas in the Galactic longitude direction.\nThe Spitzer archive includes Program 18 (PI: J. Houck), which contains SH and LH spectra\n(all short integrations) of 18 FIR sources from Galactic longitudes \u22120.96 to +3.06. We\nsearched these data for the [O IV] line and other indicators of high-velocity shocked gas.\nThere is one position in the middle of the Bubble with [O IV] at similar intensity to our own\nBubble positions; the two positions on either side, at Galactic longitude \u22120.15 and +0.24,\nhave [O IV] line fluxes factors of 4 \u2013 6 fainter. The next positions on either side have no\n[O IV]. The [Fe III] flux also peaks in their Bubble position. The relatively small extent of\nthe shocked gas in Galactic longitude is another indication that the Bubble is local to the\nQuintuplet Cluster region.\nRodr\u0131\u0301guez-Fern\u00e1ndez & Mart\u0131\u0301n-Pintado (2005) observed most of these positions with\nISO. They also found the gas in the center of the Bubble (position M+0.16\u22120.10) has the\nhighest excitation as seen by the [N III]57/[N II]122 \u03bcm and [Ne III] 15.6/[Ne II] 12.8 \u03bcm\nline ratios. They conclude that the H II region gas at this position is mainly excited by\nthe Quintuplet Cluster but the gas seen in lines-of-sight more distant from the Arches and\nQuintuplet Clusters must have their own ionizing sources since their ionization does not\ndecrease with distance from the clusters. This is in accord with our conclusion that the\nBubble is excited by the Quintuplet Cluster stars.\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\n6.\n\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nWe present Spitzer IRS spectra of the Arched Filaments, Sickle Handle, and Bubble in\nthe GC, along with spectra of the diffuse ISM at Galactic latitudes up to \u00b10.3\u25e6 from the\nGalactic plane. In this paper we concentrate on interpreting the ionic lines, using the H2\nlines and continuum mainly for estimation of the interstellar extinction.\nFrom our estimates of the radial velocities of the H2 lines, accurate to 10 \u2013 20 km s\u22121 ,\nwe infer that there are significant contributions to the H2 lines seen in our spectra from\ngas at locations along the line-of-sight other than the location of the ionized gas. The H2\nline ratios are consistent with emission from multiple components at different temperatures.\nThe low excitation ionized lines ([Si II] and [Fe II]) have both radial velocities and relative\nintensities better correlated with those of the more highly ionized H II region lines than with\nthe H2 lines. We conclude that these lines are formed in both the H II regions and in PDRs\nclosely associated with these H II regions.\nThe abundances of neon and sulfur with respect to hydrogen are a factor of \u223c 1.6 larger\nthan those of the Orion Nebula, the standard for interstellar abundance studies. We note\nthat these abundances are quite sensitive to Te because of the sensitivity of the H 7 \u2013 6 line\nemissivity to Te , which we assume equals 6000 \u00b1 500 K. The effect is such that if one assumes\na lower Te , as though there were more cooling from higher metallicity, one will as a result\ndeduce higher metallicities. This shows the importance of accurate measurements of Te .\nThe measurement positions that we chose sample both sides of various ionization structures, thereby enabling identification of the direction from which the ionizing photons originate. The south rim (b \u223c \u22120.17\u25e6 to \u22120.25\u25e6 ) of the Bubble is ionized by a source at higher\nGalactic latitude, probably the Quintuplet Cluster. This part of the Bubble rim is not the\nouter edge of the G0.11\u22120.11 molecular cloud, which lies along the same line-of-sight.\nThe Arched Filaments are ionized by the Arches Cluster. The Arched Filament positions\nare the only locations where the Si+ /H+ abundance ratio is relatively low, probably because\nsilicon is largely doubly ionized there. Such an ionization pattern can happen only when the\nionizing stars are nearby, and the Arches Cluster is much closer to the Arched Filaments\nthan any other known source that produces a substantial number of ionizing photons.\nThe highest excitation, as seen by the indicators Ne++ /Ne+ , S+3 /S++ , Si+ /S++ , and\nO+3 /(Ne+ + Ne++ ), is found in the center of the Bubble and not at the locations of the\nArches and Quintuplet Clusters. At the present time there is probably a several pc line-ofsight offset between the Arches Cluster and the ionized gas. This is not unreasonable since\nthe clusters are of ages such that they have orbited the Galaxy at least once since their\nformation.\n\n\f\u2013 23 \u2013\nThere are multiple indicators of strong shocks, peaking in the center of the Bubble.\nThis is indicated both by the presence of O+3 , which cannot be photoionized by stars with\nas large a metallicity as exists in the GC, and by the increase by a factor of 5 \u2013 8 of gas-phase\niron from Fe/H \u223c 1.3 \u00d7 10\u22126 in the Arched Filaments to Fe/H \u223c 9 \u00d7 10\u22126 in the Bubble.\nThis increase in the gas-phase iron abundance is probably produced by shock destruction of\ngrains. The strong shocks possibly indicate the location of a violent outflow in the recent\npast. We suggest that the source of this outflow is the Quintuplet Cluster. A shock velocity\n. 100 km s\u22121 is adequate to produce both the observed O+3 and Fegas .\nFinally, we note that we have observed a wide variety of conditions in the GC. These\nwould all occur in the same aperture in an observation of a distant starburst galaxy. One\ncannot assume that the highest excitation gas is associated with the most massive cluster\n- in the GC it most certainly is not.\nThis work is based on observations made with the Spitzer Space Telescope, which is operated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under a contract\nwith NASA.

With the extinction as high as it\nis in the GC, the choice of extinction law for the extinction correction obviously affects the\nvarious MIR line ratios.\nWe can test this effect using the three observed H2 lines. Figure 15 shows flux ratios of\nthe extinction-corrected H2 S(2)/S(1) and S(0)/S(2) lines plotted versus the optical depth at\n\n\f\u2013 24 \u2013\n9.6 \u03bcm, \u03c49.6 (the 10 \u03bcm silicate feature peaks at 9.6 \u03bcm in Chiar & Tielens' (2006) table for\nthe GC). Because Draine's (2003a, b) relation is substantially different, we also estimate \u03c49.6\nfor each position using his law for the diffuse ISM (R = 3.1) and then correct our observed\nH2 line fluxes for this extinction. The ratios of the fluxes thus corrected are also plotted in\nFig. 15. We see that the H2 flux ratios corrected with Draine's extinction law have a strong\ndependence on \u03c49.6 whereas the flux ratios corrected with Chiar & Tielens' GC law have a\nmuch smaller dependence on \u03c49.6 . Since the extinction at 28 \u03bcm is due to the tail of the 18\n\u03bcm silicate feature, the S(0)/S(1) flux ratio does not show any difference due to extinction\nlaw and is not plotted; the slope is slightly negative, perhaps indicating that the positions\nwith higher extinction (mostly in or near the Arched Filaments) have warmer H2 .\nFigures 16 and 17 shows the H2 S(0)/S(1) and S(0)/S(2) flux ratios plotted versus the\nS(2)/S(1) flux ratio for our observed fluxes corrected for extinction with the laws from both\nChiar & Tielens (2006) for the GC and from Draine (2003a, b). We also plot curves of the\ntheoretical equilibrium ratios for local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). The observed flux\nratios fall far above this line; in effect, the S(1) line is much weaker than would be predicted\nfrom the S(0)/S(2) ratio. The LTE curve assumes the equilibrium ortho/para ratio (an\nextra factor of 3 in the statistical weights for the odd levels) - deviations such as seen here\nhave been interpreted as non-equilibrium excitation due to shocks. However, it is not likely\nthat the observed H2 emission comes from a region of constant physical conditions along the\nline-of-sight to the GC. The dashed and dotted lines show that the observed ratios can be\nproduced by simple two-component models: a cooler molecular cloud that produces most of\nthe H2 S(0) flux and a warmer PDR that produces most of the H2 S(2) flux. However, we\nsee that the flux ratios corrected with the Draine (2003a, b) extinction law require a much\nlarger high-temperature component than the flux ratios corrected with the Chiar & Tielens\n(2006) extinction law. We conclude from Figs. 15 to 17 that the Chiar & Tielens (2006) GC\nextinction law gives a better fit to the H2 line flux ratios than does the Draine (2003a, b)\nextinction law.\n\nREFERENCES\nAfflerbach, A., Churchwell, E., & Werner, M.
