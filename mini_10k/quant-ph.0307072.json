An example\nis the children's game \"rock, scissors, paper\" (R, S, P ) where R > S > P > R.\nWe discuss the conditions under which quantum versions of R, S, P retain\nthe non-transitive characteristics of the corresponding classical game. Some\nphysical implications of non-transitivity in quantum game theory are also\nconsidered.\n\n1\n\n\fRecent years have witnessed a rapid growth of interest in quantum game theory, motivated in part by potential applications to quantum computing. Quantum games are generally derived from the corresponding classical games by introducing some inherently quantum mechanical feature (such as superposition of states [1] or entanglement [2]), which can\nbe incorporated in more than one way. In a 2-player game, where each player has two\npure strategies available, a widely discussed scheme for entanglement is that due to Eisert,\nWilkins, and Lewenstein (EWL) [3]. The object of the present paper is to discuss 2-player\ngames with three pure strategies (A, B, C) using the EWL formalism for entanglement. The\nnovel feature of such games is that they allow for the possibility of non-transitive strategies (A > B > C > A). It is well known that non-transitivity arises in classical games\n[4] and in real-world applications, and can lead to surprising -and seemingly paradoxical outcomes. This naturally leads to the question of whether similar non-transitive effects arise\nin quantum versions of classical games and, if so, whether similarly unexpected effects can\nbe present at the quantum level.\nA simple 2-player, 3-strategy game is the children's choosing game \"rock (R), scissors\n(S), paper (P )\" in which rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock\n(R > S > P > R). A payoff matrix for the 3 strategies of this zero-sum game is shown in\nTable I. (Quantum games with 3 \u00d7 3 payoff matrices and larger have have been discussed\nby Wang, et al. [5].) We can formulate a quantum analog of this game by using the EWL\nentanglement formalism. In the quantum version of this game the strategies R, S, and P are\nrepresented by three matrices which act on qubits from which payoffs are determined. The\nquantum game can be played as follows: In the absence of entanglement each player (Alice\nand Bob) is given a separate copy of the same qubit which is in one of three orthogonal\nstates denoted by |100i, |010i, or |001i. Without loss of generality we assume that the same\nqubit is used for the initial state in every game. This qubit can then be manipulated by\nany of three matrices denoted by R, S, and P , each of which rotates the initial state into\none of the three orthogonal states. Once both players have implemented their strategies (R,\nS, or P ), the final qubits for both players are compared using the payoff matrix in Table\n2\n\n\fI. An examination of this Table shows that R > S > P > R. In the EWL formalism the\nqubits are entangled by an operator before the players act on them with R, S, or P , and\nthen disentangled afterwards. Since the EWL entanglement operator commutes with any\ndirect-product combination of R, S, and P , the net effect of introducing entanglement in\nthis manner is to produce a quantum game whose outcomes are identical to those of the\ncorresponding classical game.\nIf a game is repeated many times, a competitor may elect to play any of R, S, or P in\neach game, and in such a circumstance quantum games can be formulated in which payoff\nfunctions unique to quantum mechanics may result. If the probabilities for the actions R, S,\nor P are pR , pS , and pP respectively, a player is said to be adopting a mixed strategy. Two\nways of incorporating mixed strategies in quantum games can be considered, and these lead\nin general to different outcomes. In one approach, pR , pS , and pP are simply the classical\nprobabilities of using each of the quantum operators R, S, or P . By contrast, the second\napproach combines the operators R, S, or P and the respective probability amplitudes into\na single matrix. The difference in the two constructions can be illustrated in the 2 \u00d7 2 case\n(Alice's 2 choices \u00d7 Bob's 2 choices): In the former approach each player would have only\ntwo options (N = no \u2212 f lip and F = f lip) for each game,\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\n\nN =\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n\uf8f6\n\n1 0\uf8f7\n0 1\n\n\uf8f7,\n\uf8f8\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\n\nF =\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n\uf8f6\n\n0 1\uf8f7\n1 0\n\n\uf8f7,\n\uf8f8\n\n(1)\n\nwhich act on the initial game state, either (10) or (01). Assigning a classical probability p to\nusing N and (1 \u2212 p) to using F would then define a mixed strategy. It should be noted that\nother choices for N and F are interesting to study [6], but we shall restrict our discussion\nto those given in Eq. (1). This entanglement technique requires that a player make a choice\nin each game. A maximized entanglement operation, J, can be introduced into such a game\nthat commutes with any direct-product combination of N and F but does not commute\nwith a general matrix,\ni\n1\nJ = \u221a (N \u2297 N) + \u221a (F \u2297 F ),\n2\n2\n3\n\n(2)\n\n\fwhere N \u2297 N = N(Alice) \u2297 N(Bob), etc.. Payoff functions for both players unique to\nquantum mechanics are possible if either player cheats by using neither N nor F .\nIn the second approach the actions available to each player, along with the probability\namplitudes for selecting them, are built into the single unitary matrix U,\n\u221a\np \u2212 1 \u2212 p \uf8f7 \uf8ec cos \u03b8 \u2212 sin \u03b8 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7,\n\uf8f7=\uf8ec\nU =\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\u221a\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n\u221a\nsin \u03b8 cos \u03b8\n1\u2212p\np\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\u221a\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n(3)\n\nOnce p = p(\u03b8) has been chosen, a game can be played many times without the player making\nany future decisions. An entanglement matrix for such a game was provided by EWL,\n1\ni\nJ = \u221a (N \u2297 N) + \u221a (F \u2032 \u2297 F \u2032 ),\n2\n2\n\n(4)\n\nwhere\n\uf8eb\n\nF\u2032 = \uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\n0 \u22121 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n1 0\n\n\uf8f8.\n\n(5)\n\nBefore turning to the 3-strategy case we note that although some properties of quantum\ngames are identical to those of classical games [7], the EWL entanglement technique can\nlead to payoff functions that cannot be reproduced in a classical game. Consider a situation\nwhere each player introduces an additional phase, \u03c6, to his/her play:\n\uf8eb\n\ni\u03c6\n\n\uf8ece\n\nU(\u03b8, \u03c6) = \uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n\uf8f6\n\ncos \u03b8\n\nsin \u03b8\n\n\u2212 sin \u03b8 \uf8f7\n\n\u2212i\u03c6\n\ne\n\ncos \u03b8\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n(6)\n\nThe final expected payoff function, $\u0304a , for Alice is\n$\u0304a = a11 [c2a c2b cos2 (\u03c6a + \u03c6b )]\n\n(7)\n\n+a10 (ca sb cos \u03c6a \u2212 sa cb sin \u03c6b )2\n+a01 (sa cb cos \u03c6b \u2212 ca sb sin \u03c6a )2\n+a00 [sa sb + ca cb sin (\u03c6a + \u03c6b )]2 ,\nwhere \u03c6a (\u03c6b ) is the additional phase for Alice(Bob), ca = cos \u03b8a , sa = sin \u03b8a and the \u2032 a\u2032 s\nare Alice's payoff coefficients. For non-zero but fixed values of \u03c6a and \u03c6b Alice's payoff is\n4\n\n\fnon-linear in pa = c2a , whereas a classical 2 \u00d7 2 game produces only payoff functions that are\nlinear in pa .\nThe 2 \u00d7 2 EWL entanglement formalism can be easily shown to work equally well with\neither formulation of a mixed strategy. However, in the 3 \u00d7 3 case (2 players with 3 choices\neach), these approaches require different entanglement matrices as we now discuss. We begin\nby exhibiting the 3 \u00d7 3 analog of the operators N and F in Eq. (1) which we take to be:\n\uf8eb\n\nU1 =\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n1 0 0\uf8f7\n0 1 0\n0 0 1\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7,\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\nU2 =\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n0 0 1\uf8f7\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7,\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\nU3 =\n\n\uf8ec0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n\uf8f6\n\n1 0\uf8f7\n0 1\n\n1 0 0\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7,\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n(8)\n\nwhere [U2 , U3 ] = 0. The players use these matrices in different spaces to act on initial wave\nfunctions such as |11i = (100)a \u2297 (100)b. The analog of the first approach for constructing a\nmixed strategy is for each player to assign classical probabilities pi to each of the Ui where\nP\n\npi = 1. (Other choices for these matrices lead to identical results.) The commutativity of\n\nU1 , U2 and U3 can be exploited to create a mixing matrix similar to that of EWL [3].\nIn direct analogy to Eq.

For the general N \u00d7 N case, the combination of Eqs. (16) and (20) thus leads\nto an expression for the \u03b1i in Eq. (13), and hence to an appropriate expression for J.\nThe 3\u00d73 game that we consider is \"rock, scissors, paper\" (R,S,P) shown in Table I which\nhas the interesting non-transitive property (R > S > P > R). As shown in the Table, a\npayoff of +1 has been assigned to winning, \u22121 to losing, and 0 for both in case of a tie. It is\nwell known that in a 2 \u00d7 2 game such as the \"prisoner's dilemma\", a player using a quantum\nstrategy can improve his/her expected payoff provided that his/her opponent continues to\nuse a classical strategy. The question then arises whether this can also happen in a 3 \u00d7 3\ngame which is non-transitive at the classical level. To address this question we note that\n\u02c6\nthe generic matrix, J,\nJ\u02c6 = \u03b11 U1 \u2297 U1 + \u03b12 U2 \u2297 U2 + \u03b13 U3 \u2297 U3\n\n7\n\n(21)\n\n\f\uf8eb\n\n=\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n\uf8f6\n\na 0 0 0 c 0 0 0 b\uf8f7\n0 a 0 0 0 c b 0 0\n\n0 0 a c 0 0 0 b 0\n0 0 b a 0 0 0 c 0\nb 0 0 0 a 0 0 0 c\n0 b 0 0 0 a c 0 0\n0 c 0 0 0 b a 0 0\n0 0 c b 0 0 0 a 0\nc 0 0 0 b 0 0 0 a\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\nhas no effect on the payoff matrix because it transforms eigenstates to others with identical\npayoffs. It follows from this discussion that the matrix J in Eq. (9), which satisfies all the\ncriteria for a mixing matrix in 3 \u00d7 3 games, produces outcomes for the quantum version of\nthe non-transitive game R, S, P which are identical to those for the classical game. Since\nthis conclusion also holds for the generic matrix J\u02c6 in Eq. (21) (assuming unitarity), we\ncan conclude that the quantum versions of R, S, P constructed from J or J\u02c6 will retain the\nnon-transitive behavior present in the classical game. We emphasize, however, that the\napplication of J or J\u02c6 to other 3 \u00d7 3 games can be expected to produce quantum games\nwhose outcomes are generally different from those of the corresponding classical game.\nSince the survival of non-transitivity in the quantum domain is a fundamental feature\nin 3 \u00d7 3 games, we present an alternative proof of this result which clarifies some of the\nunderlying assumptions. We assume that Alice uses a strategy (which is separable into a\nproduct of 'classical' and 'quantum' operators), Q\u2032 = Ui Q, for every game and that Bob\nuses some 'classical' strategy Uj . In this case, the final game state is\n|\u03c8f i = Jb\u2020 [Ui Q \u2297 Uj ]Jb |11i.\n\n(22)\n\nIf |\u03c8jq i \u2261 Jb\u2020 [Q \u2297 11]Jb |11i then the final state becomes\n|\u03c8f i = Ui \u2297 Uj |\u03c8jq i.\n8\n\n(23)\n\n\fNon-transitivity survives because Bob is still able to win regardless of what Alice does: he\ncan turn any advantage that Alice creates with Q into an advantage to himself simply by\nchoosing another Uj . It is important to note that, unlike the \"prisoner's dilemma\", the use\nof quantum strategies by both players cannot be mutually beneficial to both players because\nthe game is zero sum.\nIn the preceding discussion we considered non-transitive 3 \u00d7 3 games in a framework\nanalogous to that following Eq. (1) in the 2\u00d72 case. We turn next to a quantum formulation\nof 3 \u00d7 3 games analogous to that following from Eq. (3). It can be shown that the preceding\nproof of non-transitivity survives for this formulation as well. The matrix that can be used\nto transform an initial eigenstate into any other eigenstate is generated by the following\nmatrices, which are Hermitian and unitary,\n\uf8eb\n\nH1 =\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n1 0 0\uf8f7\n0 0 1\n0 1 0\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7,\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\nH2 =\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n\uf8f6\n\n0 1 0\uf8f7\n1 0 0\n0 0 1\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7.\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n(24)\n\nEach player can use the matrix U(x, y),\nU(x, y) = eixH1 eiyH2\n\uf8eb\n\n=\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n(25)\n\neix cos y\n\nieix sin y\n\ni sin y cos x cos x cos y\n\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\niy\nie sin x \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n(26)\n\n\u2212 sin y sin x i sin x cos y eiy cos x\n\nto transform an initial state, |1i = (100), into any other state to simulate a pure strategy.\nFor this choice of U(x, y) the additional phases that have been introduced have no net effect\non probabilities or payoff functions. The choices of x and y define a player's mixed strategy\nin a 3 \u00d7 3 game, just as the choice of \u03b8 [Eq. (3)] does in the 2 \u00d7 2 game. U(x, y) satisfies\nthe commutation relation 0 = [U(x, y), F \u2032\u2032 ], where\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n2 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec \u22121 2\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n1\n\u2032\u2032\n\uf8ec\nF = \uf8ec 2 \u22121 2 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7.\n3\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n2 2 \u22121\n9\n\n(27)\n\n\fBecause F \u2032\u2032 and U(x, y) commute, so do F \u2032\u2032 \u2297 F \u2032\u2032 and U(xa , ya ) \u2297 U(xb , yb), where xa and\nya (xb and yb ) define Alice's (Bob's) mixed strategy. This suggests the introduction of the\nfollowing (maximally entangled) mixing matrix,\n1\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\nJ \u0304 = e\u2212i\u03c0/4F \u2297F = \u221a [11 \u2297 11 \u2212 iF \u2032\u2032 \u2297 F \u2032\u2032 ]\n2\n\n(28)\n\nwhich commutes with any U(xa , ya ) \u2297 U(xb , yb ). The matrix J \u0304 in Eq. (28) is the exact\n3 \u00d7 3 analog of the entanglement matrix used by EWL in their discussion of the \"prisoner's\ndilemma\" [3]. There is considerable freedom on the part of each player in how he/she chooses\nto deviate from U(x, y), since a variable equivalent to \u03c6 can be introduced into a player's\ntransformation matrix in numerous ways.\nIn summary, we have developed a formalism for dealing with entanglement in 3 \u00d7 3\nquantum games, when each player adopts a mixed strategy. Although this formalism can\nbe applied to any N \u00d7 N game, our focus in this paper has been on the simplest nontransitive 3 \u00d7 3 game. As noted above, classical non-transitive games are of great interest,\nsince they can lead to seemingly paradoxical results in real-world examples [4]. One of the\ncentral results of the present paper is that non-transitivity survives in the quantum versions\nof the corresponding games. This naturally raises the question of whether similar apparent\nparadoxes can arise in physically realizable quantum systems. Although this question cannot\nbe answered definitively at the present time, physical systems exist which exhibit the nontransitive features of both the \"voter's paradox\" and the \"Penney paradox\" [4]. As we\ndiscuss elsewhere [9], tables of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients have properties similar to those\nof the magic square, whose non-transitive properties underlie the \"voter's paradox\". It is\nthus possible that interesting non-transitive effects may arise in ensembles of particles with\nnon-zero angular momenta whose behavior can be modeled by the 3\u00d73 non-transitive games\nthat we have presented here.\nThe authors wish to thank Dennis Krause for many helpful discussions.
