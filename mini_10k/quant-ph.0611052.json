Shiekh\u2217\nDin\u00e9 College, Tsaile, Arizona, U.S.A.\n\nAbstract\nAn error correcting mechanism is proposed in the context of the Quantum Interference Computer approach\n\n1 Introduction: Computing with the quantum\nThe logical bit (binary digit) is the fundamental concept in classical digital\ncomputing and can take on the state representing 0 or 1. In contrast, the\nworld on a small (atomic) scale obeys differing rules described by quantum\ntheory, which has the qubit that can be a linear superposition of these two\nstates:\n|\u03c6i = \u03b1 |0i + \u03b2 |1i\n\n(1)\n\na seemingly small change that has many profound consequences, where\nthe amplitudes \u03b1 and \u03b2 are complex numbers, and are the analog part of\nquantum theory. However, and in contrast, when we measure such a state\nwe actually get the result 0 or 1 (the state has collapsed) with probabilities\n|\u03b1|2 for |0i and |\u03b2|2 for |1i, such is the nature of the quantum world and\nthis is the digital aspect of quantum theory where conservation of the\nsystem (unitarity) demands that |\u03b1|2 + |\u03b2|2 = 1. Why the world is like\nthis, nobody really knows, and it disturbed Einstein to such an extent that\nhe stated that 'God does not play dice'; but without such a mechanism,\nwe would be denied freewill, so it is a good thing that the world is the\nway that it is.\nIn the large world such interactions are happening all the time, and\nthat is why we are not used to seeing the direct effect of these combinations. It takes a lot of care to avoid a measurement happening until one is\n\u2217 shiekh@dinecollege.edu\n\n1\n\n\fready, and this is part of the difficulty in building a quantum computing\ndevice.\nSo here we see the nature of the quantum way, where, although both\nbit types are involved, only one is seen upon measurement. There are\nfeatures of an analog system (the continuous numbers \u03b1 and \u03b2), while the\nact of measurement carries discrete, or digital, aspects.\nWe have avoided delving on the more subtle and strange aspects of\nquantum theory at this juncture, and if necessary one can adopt a pragmatic Engineering approach.\n\n1.1\n\nThe parallel nature of quantum theory\n\nBecause the quantum state carries both digits at once, unlike the classical,\nthere is the prospect of performing many calculations in parallel. This is\nseen even more clearly for a 2 qubit quantum system, whose state would\nlook like:\n|\u03c8i = \u03b100 |0i |0i + \u03b101 |0i |1i + \u03b110 |1i |0i + \u03b111 |1i |1i\n\n(2)\n\nwhile in general an n qbit system has 2n components. This exponential\ngrowth in size is at the potential core of the power implicit to quantum\ncomputing, and is of such an enormous advantage that a system with\njust 300 bits would have more states than there are atoms in the visible\nUniverse (about 1080 ). This leads one to pondering how or where all these\ncalculations are performed and held, and such questions remind us why\nPhysics once went under the name of Natural Philosophy.\nThe above state is often written more compactly as:\n\u03b100 |00i + \u03b101 |01i + \u03b110 |10i + \u03b111 |11i\n\n(3)\n\nand if one were then to apply a function (f ) to this one state, Nature's\nquantum engine would effectively apply it to all components, yielding:\n\u03b100 f (|00i) + ... + \u03b111 f (|11i)\n\n(4)\n\nThe ability to do so very much computing in one application is the\ngood part; how this is actually achieved by Nature is not known.\n\n1.2\n\nThe restrictions of measurement\n\nThe problem (or bad part) arises upon the act of measurement, when,\nas mentioned above, one only sees one of the parts with due probability.\nAs a result no advantage has been taken of the fact that the quantum\n\n2\n\n\fworld has all that computational power, and this is exactly why quantum\ncomputers seem to be so hard to program.\nRather than detour at this point into a discussion of the various restricted approaches to date known to overcome this obstacle, we consider\nan alternative proposal that might show promise of a generic way around\nthis dilemma.\n\n2 A review of the Quantum Interference\napproach\nInterference has been proposed as an amplifying mechanism for quantum\ncomputation [1, 2]. How it is supposed to work is illustrated by the\nfollowing.\nStart with the following three qubit Hadamard state for illustration\n(leaving out normalizations for clarity)\n|\u03c8i\n\n=\n\n(|0i + |1i)(|0i + |1i)(|0i + |1i)\n\n(5)\n\n=\n\n|000i + |001i + |010i + |011i + . . . + |111i\n\n(6)\n\nand like Grover's algorithm, apply the decision function to mark the invalid solutions by inverting their phase. For the sake of argument let us\nsuppose that the solutions 001 and 011 satisfy the function, which yields\nthe state:\nSolution\n\nSolution\n\nz }| {\n\nz }| {\n\n\u2212 |000i + |001i \u2212 |010i + |011i \u2212 . . . \u2212 |111i\n\n(7)\n\nwhich has got us nowhere at all, unless one were to bring in the mechanism of Young's double slit or the beam splitter interferometer, with\nthe marking function being applied to one of the two arms alone. Then\ninterference of the arms would yield:\n\u2212 |000i + |001i \u2212 |010i + |011i \u2212 . . . \u2212 |111i\n+ |000i + |001i + |010i + |011i + . . . + |111i\n\n(8)\n\nto expose the desired solutions\n|001i + |011i\n\n(9)\n\none of which will consolidate upon measurement, and can then be confirmed on a classical computer, if so desired. The two arms are brought\ninto overlap and not sent through a final beam splitter as is typical of an\ninterferometer.\n\n3\n\n\fTo locate the remaining solution, one can start over, and exclude the\nknown solution by also inverting its phase in one of the two interference\narms. Eventually all solutions will be located and removed, so the final\nrun will expose either a non-valid solution or a previously found solution\nfrom the remnants of the wave-function.\nConcerns over lost unitarity can be allayed by noting that a quantum\ncomputer typically starts by transforming a sharp (ground) state into a\nsuperposition, and that this is a unitary change. All that is happening\nhere is the inverse, and so the process is also unitary.\nIn practice, due to imperfect cancellation, this process may need to be\nrepeated a few times before the act of measurement.\n\n3\n\nError correction\n\nAs a calculation proceeds, invalid components will spontaneously appear\nin the superposition and these can be identified by adopting the classical\nchecksum technique. These invalid calculations can then be removed at\nthe end in the same manner as invalid solutions, as detailed above.\n\nReferences\n[1] A.\n\nY.\n\nShiekh,\n\nInt.\n\nJour.\n\nTheo.\n\nPhys.,\n\n45,\n\n2006,\n\n1653\n\n[arXiv:cs.CC/0507003]\n[2] Gui\n\nLu\n\nLong,\n\nCommun.\n\nTheor.\n\n[ariXiv:quant-ph/0512120]\n\n4\n\nPhys.\n\n45(5),\n\n2006,\n\n825\n\n\f"}
