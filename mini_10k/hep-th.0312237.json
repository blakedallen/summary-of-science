Introduction\nThe holographic principle appears to be a new guiding paradigm for true understanding of\nquantum gravity theories. It states that the fundamental degrees of freedom in a certain region\nof spacetime is bounded not by its volume but by its boundary area[1, 2]. Based on the earlier\nattempts[3, 4], a more precise version of the holography is proposed by Bousso[5]. In this\nproposal, one considers the \"lightsheets\" consisting of lightlike geodesic of nonpositive expansion\northogonally generated from a boundary. The entropy passing through the lightsheet should be\nbounded by the boundary area divided by the Planck area 4G. This statement is called the\ncovariant entropy bound (CEB). This proposal passes many tests so far and is widely accepted\nby now. Later, a more refined version was given by Flanagan, Marolf and Wald[6]. Here one\nconsiders the lightlike sheets consisting of lightlike geodesics orthogonally generated from one\nboundary B ending on another boundary B \u2032 . Then the proposal says that the entropy passing\nthrough the lightlike sheet should be limited by the difference of the boundary areas divided by\n4G. Hence this version is certainly stronger than the original proposal by Bousso. This is the\nformulation of the holographic principle which we shall mainly concern in this note.\nThis refined version may be proved in a semiclassical context based on two conditions. One\nis the initial condition on the lightlike sheet saying that the minus of initial expansion rate of\nthe geodesics divided by 4G should be taken to be larger than the initial entropy flux density\nthrough the lightsheet. The other is the condition on the energy flux density versus the change\nof the entropy flux density. This condition is kind of the local version of the Bekenstein bound\nof the entropy of weakly gravitating system[7],\nS \u2264 \u03c0M d\n\n(1.1)\n\nwhere M and d are respectively the energy and the linear size of the system. From the local\nentropy energy condition, the Bekenstein bound may be derived straightforwardly. In this\ncontext, we shall call the local entropy-energy condition as \"local Bekenstein bound\".\nAs discussed in detail in [8], the first condition merely puts a restriction on the choice of\nthe initial boundary surface. This is because the initial expansion rate is solely determined by\nthe choice of the surface. Hence, at least classically, the condition that leads to the proof of\nthe statement comes from the local condition on the entropy and energy densities. The local\nBekenstein bound is clearly a sufficient condition for the holography. One unsatisfactory aspect\nabout the condition is that there is no way to saturate the holography bound except some\ntrivial case where the expansion remains zero all the time[8]. One typical example is the case of\nAdS/CFT[9] where one compares the bulk gravitational entropy with the regulated boundary\narea divided 4G corresponding to the degrees of freedom of the boundary CFT[10]. According\nto the above formulation of the holography, the saturation cannot occur in the example of\nAdS/CFT because there the expansion rate is nonvanishing for the boundary surface we are\ninterested in[8]. This is disappointing because the conjectured AdS/CFT correspondence claims\nthe exact equivalence at the level of Hilbert space. This problem may disappear if the local\nBekenstein bound is modified appropriately, which we shall propose below.\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\fIn this note, we start from the CEB in D + 1 dimensions and investigate its implication upon\ndimensional reduction to the spacetime of the form M \u00d7 S 1 where S 1 is the circle and M denotes\na D dimensional geometry\u2217 . We shall first consider the case where one has vanishing KaluzaKlein gauge fields. Lightlike geodesics parallel to M in the higher dimensions remain lightlike\nviewed from lower dimensions. Assuming the local Bekenstein bound in D + 1 dimensions, the\nholography in the lower dimensions should automatically follow because the dimensional reduction does not change the statement of holography except some trivial overall factor. What we\nare asking is then the implication of the higher dimensional local Bekenstein bound. Considering\nthe KK reduction with a warping factor, we find that the D + 1 dimensional local Bekenstein\nbound leads to a new one with an order G correction from the view point of the lower dimensional spacetime. This will be our main result. We further consider the dimensional reduction\nwith a KK gauge field but with a trivial warp factor. This time we get a stronger version of\nlocal Bekenstein bound, which seems consistent with previous proposals in the presence of U (1)\ngauge field. The order G correction of the Bekenstein bound from the dimensional reduction\nshould be considered seriously because the physics behind the Bekenstein bound is not much\nunderstood now. Another virtue of this correction is that the saturation of the bound is now\npossible even with nonvanishing expansion.\nIn Section 2, we shall review the formulation of the lightlike holography of CEB. In Section 3,\nwe consider the dimensional reduction with nontrivial warping factor or with a KK gauge field.\nWe find interesting modifications of the local Bekenstein bound. Last section is devoted for the\ndiscussions.\n\n2. Review of Covariant Entropy Bound\nIn its original form proposed by Bousso[5], the covariant entropy bound states that, given a\ncodimension two spacelike hypersurface, the total entropy on a lightsheet generated by non\nexpanding null geodesics orthogonal to the hypersurface should be bounded by the area of the\nsurface in Planck unit. Null geodesics may be either future or past directed. Consider, for\nexample, a future directed focusing lightsheet, which is orthogonal to a compact surface A\nthat bounds a volume V. The covariant entropy bound dictates the total entropy flow on the\nlightsheet, which is not less than the total entropy in the volume V due to the second law of\nthermodynamics, be bounded by A/4G. Thus, the covariant entropy bound generalizes the\nold area bound. Another example would be taking a lightsheet generated by past-directed null\ngeodesics that stay on the horizon of a growing black hole. The total entropy flow on this\nlightsheet is the total entropy of infalling matter while creating the black hole. The covariant\nentropy bound dictates this be bounded by the area of the horizon, which is nothing but the\nBekenstein-Hawking entropy of the black hole. This makes a connection to the generalized\nsecond law of thermodynamics (GSL).\n\u2217\n\nThere are literatures[11, 12] considering dimensional reduction of holography in some other context. Ref.[13]\ndiscusses phenomenological implications of entropy bounds in scenarios of extra dimensions. See also Ref. [14] for\nan interesting application of the holography.\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n\fIn fact, trying to refine the connection to the GSL naturally leads to a generalization of\nthe original Bousso's proposal[6]. Imagine a situation where we have a black hole and some\nmatter is falling in it for a period of time. The GSL implies that the black hole entropy\nincrement (or equivalently, its area increment) should not be less than the infalling matter\nentropy. Consider the past-directed null geodesics staying on the horizon as described in the\nabove example, but now only during the interval of matter infalling. The GSL in this case is\nequivalent to saying that the total entropy flow on this converging lightsheet must be bounded\nby the area difference between two boundaries of the lightsheet. We may allow not only closed,\nbut also open codimension two hypersurfaces.\nMore precisely, let hypersurface orthogonal null geodesics with affine parameter \u03bb be generated by a null vector field k\u03bc , which is non expanding in the direction of k\u03bc i.e. \u03b8 \u2261 \u2207\u03bc k\u03bc \u2264 0.\nThe vector k\u03bc is either future or past directed. Denote the area of an orthogonal hypersurface\nat an affine parameter \u03bb by A(\u03bb). Then, the generalized covariant entropy bound (GCEB)\nstates that the total entropy, S(\u03bbf , \u03bbi ), on the lightsheet generated by null geodesics with affine\nparameter range [\u03bbi , \u03bbf ], should be bounded by \u2206A/4G = (A(\u03bbi ) \u2212 A(\u03bbf ))/4G,\nS(\u03bbf , \u03bbi ) \u2264\n\n\u0011\n1 \u0010\nA(\u03bbi ) \u2212 A(\u03bbf ) .\n4G\n\n(2.1)\n\nThe infinitesimal version[8] of this statement is\ns(\u03bb) \u2264 \u2212\n\n\u03b8(\u03bb)\n,\n4G\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhere s(\u03bb) \u2261 \u2212s\u03bc k\u03bc (future directed), +s\u03bc k\u03bc (past directed).\nBousso[15] showed that the GCEB actually generalizes the Bekenstein bound, S \u2264 \u03c0M d.\nThere is a heuristic way to see how the Bekenstein bound emerges from the GCEB. Consider\na weakly gravitating system with approximate spherical symmetry of mass M and radius R,\nwhose center is at the position zero of a Cartesian system {x1,2,3 }. Consider a two-surface\n{x22 + x23 \u2264 R2 } of area \u03c0R2 at x1 = R, and imagine light rays orthogonal to and coming from\nthis surface toward the system. While they are passing through the system, they are bent to\nconverge a little bit due to gravity effect. At the position x1 = \u2212R, just behind the system,\ntheir orthogonal two surface would have a reduced radius,\n1\nR\u2032 \u2248 R \u2212 g(\u2206t)2 ,\n2\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhere g = GM/R2 is the gravity acceleration at the radius R, and \u2206t = 2R\nc is the traveling\ntime of the light rays. Hence the contracted area at x1 = \u2212R is\n\u0013\n\u0012\n4\u03c0GM R\n1 GM \u0010 2R \u00112 2\n\u2032\n\u20322\n\u2248 \u03c0R2 \u2212\n,\n(2.4)\nA = \u03c0R \u2248 \u03c0 R \u2212\n2\n2 R\nc\nc2\nwhere we assumed R \u226b 2GM/c2 as usual. Thus\nA \u2212 A\u2032\n\u03c0M R\n\u2206A\n=\n\u2248\n,\n4G\n4G\nc2\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n(2.5)\n\n\fand this should bound the total entropy of the system, S \u2264 \u03c0M R (in c = 1 unit), which is\nthe Bekenstein bound. The Bousso's analysis in Ref. [15] refines the gravity effect using the\nEinstein's equation for an arbitrary shape of the system. The result is a generalization of the\nBekenstein bound, S \u2264 \u03c0M d, where d is now the smallest distance of any two parallel planes\nthat can enclose the system. This generalized Bekenstein bound may become very strong for\nthin systems.\nIn Refs.

To show that ii) leads to the usual Bekenstein bound,\nlet us consider a finite size, weakly gravitating system whose extension in x1 direction is \u2206x.\nWe call the other transverse dimensions ~y collectively. We next imagine almost parallel light\nrays (due to weak gravity) traveling along x1 direction, and normalize their affine parameter \u03bb\nsuch that\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202\n\u2202 \u03bc\nd x\u03bc\n,\n(2.11)\n+\n=\n\u00b1k\u03bc = \u00b1\nd\u03bb\u00b1\n\u2202t \u2202x1\nwhere +k\u03bc is for future-directed, while \u2212k\u03bc is for past-directed. Thus, \u03bb+ (\u03bb\u2212 ) can be identified\nto x1 (\u2212x1 ). We let \u03bb+ run from xi1 to xf1 and \u03bb\u2212 from xf1 to xi1 , where xi1 (xf1 ) is the starting\n(ending) point of the system in x1 direction. Note that ii) is independent of a normalization of\naffine parameter.

Dimensional Reduction of Covariant Entropy Bound\nIf the correct quantum theory of gravity is higher dimensional and it indeed has the GCEB as\nits fundamental aspect, we would have several extra spatial dimensions. One may expect that\nthe GCEB in higher dimensions will dimensionally reduce to the GCEB in four dimensions for\ngeneric four dimensional observers whose energy scale is much smaller than the compactification\nscale. However, some trace of the higher dimensional nature of the fundamental theory may\nmanifest itself in certain modifications of entropy bounds observed in lower dimensions. In cases\nwhere the existence of an additional dimension is only to provide some specific lower dimensional\nsituations, like a presence of a KK U (1) gauge field, the resulting modification of entropy bounds\nin lower dimensions can be naturally attributed to a necessary modification of entropy bounds\nin lower dimensions in the presence of these specific situations. Namely dimensional reduction\nplays a role of a consistent tool to derive these modifications. In this section, we study the\nGCEB in D + 1 spacetime dimensions, with one spatial dimension compactified on circle S 1 of\ncoordinate size L, and describe the covariant entropy bound that is relevant to D dimensional\nobservers. By repeating this step, we may get down to any lower dimensions from any higher\ndimensions.\nWe will consider two specific examples. In the first case, we analyze the GCEB in D + 1\ndimensions formulated in terms of two conditions i) and ii), in the space of an Einstein metric,\n1\n\nE\ndx\u03b1 dx\u03b2 + K(x)(dxD )2 ,\nds2 = g\u0303M N dxM dxN = K(x) 2\u2212D g\u03b1\u03b2\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere M, N = 0, . . . , D run over D + 1 dimensions, \u03b1, \u03b2 = 0, . . . , D \u2212 1 are noncompact D\nE\ndimensional indices, and xD is the compact S 1 direction. The warp factor K(x) as well as g\u03bc\u03bd\nE is the corresponding Einstein\nis set to be independent of xD . With the above factorization, g\u03bc\u03bd\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n\fmetric in D dimensions. Note that entropy bounds are formulated in terms of Einstein metrics.\nThe second case we are going to study is the metric,\nE\nds2 = g\u03b1\u03b2\ndx\u03b1 dx\u03b2 + (dxD + l A\u03b1 dx\u03b1 )2 ,\n\n(3.2)\n\nwhere again everything is set to be independent of xD , and G is the Newton's constant in\n\u221a\nD dimensions. Here we introduce the length scale l defined by 16\u03c0G. In D dimensions,\nour system includes a KK U (1) gauge field A\u03b1 . The above normalization of A\u03b1 produces the\nstandard gauge kinetic term. In the following, we put tilde for every relevant D + 1 dimensional\nquantity.\nWe start from the two conditions, i) and ii), in D + 1 dimensions,\ni) s\u0303(0) \u2264 \u2212\nii)\n\nds\u0303\nd\u03bb\u0303\n\n\u03b8\u0303(0)\n,\n4G\u0303\n\n\u2264 2\u03c0 T\u0303M N q M q N ,\n\n(3.3)\n(3.4)\n\nwhich lead to the D + 1 dimensional GCEB,\ns\u0303(\u03bb\u0303) \u2264 \u2212\n\n\u03b8\u0303(\u03bb\u0303)\n,\n4G\u0303\n\n(3.5)\n\nwhere q M (M = 0, . . . , D) are hypersurface orthogonal null geodesics, s\u0303 = \u2212sM q M is the entropy\nflow, \u03b8\u0303 = \u2207M q M is the codimension two area contraction, T\u0303M N is the energy-momentum tensor,\nand G\u0303 is the Newton's constant, all in D+1 dimensions. Note that \u03bb\u0303 is the affine parameter with\nrespect to the D + 1 dimensional Einstein metric. Now we take a codimension two hypersurface\nB\u0303 which is a direct product of a codimension two hypersurface in D dimensions B and S 1 in\nxD direction, i.e. B\u0303 = B \u00d7 S 1 . Then, we choose hypersurface orthogonal q M of the form,\nq M = (q \u03b1 , 0 )\n\n(3.6)\n\nwhere q \u03b1 is independent of xD and is hypersurface orthogonal to the D dimensional codimension\ntwo surface B. For the metrics we are going to consider, it is easy to check that q D = 0 is\npreserved, and moreover, q \u03b1 is a null geodesic with respect to the D dimensional Einstein metric\nwith an appropriate rescaling of its affine parameter. Thus, we may formulate a D dimensional\nGCEB derived from the D + 1 dimensional GCEB for this rescaled D dimensional hypersurface\northogonal null geodesics. We will simply rewrite the conditions i) and ii) in D + 1 dimensions\nin terms of correctly defined D dimensional quantities. These D dimensional conditions, i\u2032 ) and\nii\u2032 ), have modified expressions from the original proposal i) and ii). Then, the mathematical\nprocedure leading to s\u0303 \u2264 \u2212\u03b8\u0303/4G\u0303 from i) and ii) in D + 1 dimensions guarantees that we must\nhave a corresponding mathematical proof of the D dimensional version of the GCEB from the\nmodified conditions i\u2032 ) and ii\u2032 ) that are obtained from dimensional reduction. Noting that the\ncondition ii) (or ii\u2032 )) may be the most fundamental bound, the modifications in ii\u2032 ) we have\nobtained in this paper should be considered seriously.\n\n\u20137\u2013\n\n\f3.1 The warped metric case\nWe first consider the metric,\n1\n\nE\nds2 = g\u0303M N dxM dxN = K(x) 2\u2212D g\u03b1\u03b2\ndx\u03b1 dx\u03b2 + K(x)(dxD )2 ,\n\n(3.7)\n\nand a null geodesic vector field\nq M = (q \u03b1 (x), 0 ) ,\n\n(3.8)\n\nwhich is orthogonal to B\u0303 = B \u00d7 S 1 , and independent of xD . From the null geodesic equation of\nq M , it is easy to find that\n1\nk\u03b1 \u2261 K 2\u2212D q \u03b1 ,\n(3.9)\nE . In other words, the affine\nis a correctly normalized D dimensional null geodesic in terms of g\u03bc\u03bd\nE\nparameter \u03bb with respect to g\u03bc\u03bd is given by\n1\nd\nd\n,\n= K 2\u2212D\nd\u03bb\nd\u03bb\u0303\n\n(3.10)\n\nwhere \u03bb\u0303 is the affine parameter of q M . Thus,\n\u03b1\n\u03b8\u0303 \u2261 \u2207M q M = \u2202\u03b1 q \u03b1 + \u0393\u0303M\nM \u03b1q\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0011\n\u0010\n1\n1\nD\u22122 k \u03b1 ,\n= \u2202\u03b1 K D\u22122 k\u03b1 + \u0393\u0303M\nM\u03b1 K\n\n(3.11)\n\nE\nwhere \u0393\u0303 is the affine connection of gM N .

Also,\nwhere \u03b8 = \u2207\u03b1 k\u03b1 is the area contraction of k\u03b1 in terms of g\u03bc\u03bd\n1\n\ns\u0303 = \u2212s\u0303M q M = \u2212 s\u0303\u03b1 K D\u22122 k\u03b1\n1\n1\ns\u03b1 k\u03b1 D\u22122\ns D\u22122\nK\nK\n=\u2212\n=\n,\nL\nL\n\n(3.14)\n\nwhere s\u03b1 \u2261 L s\u0303\u03b1 is the D dimensional entropy current density.

Using these relations,\ns\u0303(\u03bb\u0303) \u2264 \u2212\n\n\u03b8\u0303(\u03bb\u0303)\n\u03b8(\u03bb)\n,\n\u2190\u2192 s(\u03bb) \u2264 \u2212\n4G\n4G\u0303\n\n(3.32)\n\nwhere L G = G\u0303. Thus, again the condition i) and the GCEB are the same as usual.\nAn interesting modification arises in the condition ii), however. Working out the Ricci tensor\nin D + 1 dimensions in terms of D dimensional quantities,\nR\u0303\u03b1\u03b2 = R\u03b1\u03b2 +\n\n\u0011 l4\nl2 \u0010\n\u2212 F\u03b3\u03b1 F \u03b3 \u03b2 + A\u03b1 \u2207\u03b3 F\u03b2 \u03b3 + A\u03b2 \u2207\u03b3 F\u03b1 \u03b3 + A\u03b1 A\u03b2 F\u03b7\u03b3 F \u03b7\u03b3 ,\n2\n4\n\n(3.33)\n\nand remembering the gauge A\u03b1 k\u03b1 = 0, we have\n8\u03c0 G\u0303 T\u0303M N q M q N = R\u0303M N q M q N = R\u03b1\u03b2 k\u03b1 k\u03b2 \u2212 8\u03c0GF\u03b3\u03b1 k\u03b1 F \u03b3 \u03b2 k\u03b2\n\u0011\n\u0010\n= 8\u03c0G T\u03b1\u03b2 k\u03b1 k\u03b2 \u2212 F\u03b3\u03b1 k\u03b1 F \u03b3 \u03b2 k\u03b2 .\n\n(3.34)\n\nThis gives us\nM N\n\n2\u03c0 T\u0303M N q q\n\n\u001a\n\u001b\n1\n\u03b1 \u03b2\n\u03b1\n\u03b3\n\u03b2\n=\n2\u03c0T\u03b1\u03b2 k k \u2212 2\u03c0F\u03b3\u03b1 k F \u03b2 k ,\nL\n\n(3.35)\n\nand the condition ii) is dimensionally reduce to\nii\u2032 )\n\nds\n\u2264 2\u03c0 (T\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 F\u03b3\u03b1 F \u03b3 \u03b2 ) k\u03b1 k\u03b2 .\nd\u03bb\n\n(3.36)\n\nWe propose that this is the correct version of the Bekenstein bound in the presence of a U (1)\ngauge interaction. This kind of correction is not new. In the presence of electromagnetic charge,\nthere appeared a proposal[18],\n\u0012\n\u0013\nQ2\nS \u2264 2\u03c0R E \u2212\n(3.37)\n2R\nwhere R is the radius of the spherically symmetric system and Q is the charge. The modification\nappearing in our bound has the same structure because one is subtracting the electromagnetic\ncontribution from the total energy-momentum tensor. It is clear that our proposal corresponds\nto the local version of (3.37).\nThe correction term is negative definite. To show this, let us work in a local Lorentzian frame\nwhere the metric becomes flat with g\u03bc\u03bd = diag(\u22121, 1, * * * , 1). It follows that,\nF\u03b3\u03b1 k\u03b1 F \u03b3 \u03b2 k\u03b2 = F0i F0i kj kj \u2212 (F0i ki )2 + Fij kj Fik kk \u2265 0 ,\n\n(3.38)\n\nwhere we used the fact k02 = ki ki . Hence this part of the correction gives a tighter bound than\nthe original proposal.\n\n\u2013 11 \u2013\n\n\f4. Physical Implication of the refined local Bekenstein bound\nIn the previous section, we obtained the refined version of local Bekenstein bound in D dimensions\nds\n4G 2\n\u2264 2\u03c0 T\u03bc\u03bd k\u03bc k\u03bd +\ns\n(4.1)\nd\u03bb\nD\u22122\n\nthrough dimensional reduction. Once we accept the conditions i) and ii) in arbitrary dimensions\nfor the lightlike holography, the above follows naturally as we have seen in the previous section.\nFirst of all, the correction is of next order in the Newton's constant G. Note that the validity\nof the original Bekenstein bound was argued mainly for weakly gravitating systems. Since our\nmodification is of order G, this new bound is quite consistent with previous investigations in\nthis respect.\nThe second point is that now the condition allows a nontrivial saturation of the holography\nbound. Consider, for example, a system with spherical symmetry, which implies that the shear,\n\u03c3\u03bc\u03bd , is vanishing. It is clear that the lightlike holography can be saturated if the new local\nentropy bound is saturated and if s(0) = \u2212\u03b8(0)/(4G). The condition of zero expansion is no\nlonger required.\nTo illustrate the above point, let us consider the AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 geometry dual to the N=4 SYM\ntheory. The AdS metric in the Poincare patch reads\n2\n\nds =\n\n2\nRAdS\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2212dt2 + dz 2 + d~y 2\nz2\n\n\u0013\n\n(4.2)\n\nwhere ~y is a D \u2212 2 dimensional coordinate with D = 5 for the AdS5 . According to the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence, the entropy of AdS bulk counted by the boundary area divided by 4G5 ought\nto saturate the maximal entropy of the boundary CFT[10]. Thus, for the maximal capacity of\nbulk entropy current, the saturation of the holography bound is necessary for the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence to hold. The boundary of interest is located at z = \u03b4, which is related to the\nUV cut-off energy scale of the SYM theory by \u039b = 1/\u03b4 via the UV/IR connection. The geodesic\northogonally generated from the boundary is described by\nk\u03bc =\n\nz2\n(1, 1, ~0)\n2\nRAdS\n\n(4.3)\n\nwith k\u03bc = (k0 , kz , ~ky ). Along the geodesic, the affine parameter \u03bb is related to the coordinate\nby\nR2\n(4.4)\nz = \u2212 AdS\n\u03bb\n2\n/\u03b4, \u22120) for z \u2208 (\u03b4, \u221e). In the transverse space of ~y, one has\nwith a range (\u2212RAdS\n\n\u2207n km =\n\n1\n\u03b4nm\nz\n\n\u2013 12 \u2013\n\n(4.5)\n\n\f2\n.\nwhere n and m are indices for the ~y directions. Hence \u03c3nm = \u03c9nm = 0 and \u03b8 = \u2212(D\u22122) z /RAdS\nTherefore the saturation of the holography bound implies\n\ns=\u2212\n\n(D \u2212 2) z\n\u03b8\n(D \u2212 2) 1\n=\n=\u2212\n2\n4G5\n4G5 RAdS\n4G5 \u03bb\n\n(4.6)\n\nSince the system is time independent, the entropy current density is then\ns\u03bc =\n\n(D \u2212 2) z\n(1, 0, ~0) ,\n2\n4G5 RAdS\n\n(4.7)\n\nwhich is consistent with the scale symmetry of the AdS geometry. One may check that the\nabove entropy density saturates our local bound (4.1) as\n4G5 2 (D \u2212 2) 1\nds\n=\ns =\n,\nd\u03bb\nD\u22122\n4G5 \u03bb2\n\n(4.8)\n\nAdS k \u03bc k \u03bd = 0 that follows from the fact T AdS \u223c g . For \u03bb \u2208 (\u03bb , \u03bb ), the integrated form\nwith T\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bc\u03bd\ni f\n\u03bc\u03bd\nof the entropy flux through the lightsheet becomes\n\nS(\u03bbf , \u03bbi ) \u2261\n\nZ\n\nd~y\n\nZ\n\n\u03bbf\n\nd\u03bb\n\n\u03bbi\n\nR\u03bb\n\u221a\nd\u03bb\u2032 \u03b8(\u03bb\u2032 )\n=\nh s e \u03bbi\n\n1\n4G5\n\nZ\n\nd~y\n\n|\u03bbi |D\u22122 \u2212 |\u03bbf |D\u22122\nD\u22122\nRAdS\n\n,\n\n(4.9)\n\nwhich agrees with (Ai \u2212 Af )/4G5 . Here h is the determinant of the induced metric for the\nboundary surface. With the choice of \u03bbf = \u22120, the lightsheet covers the whole coordinate patch\nand S = Ai /4G5 , which is the desired relation for the holography. Thus, the bulk entropy\nsurrounded by the z = \u03b4 boundary can be consistently saturated by the Bekenstein-Hawking\nentropy formula. There is a nonsupersymmetric dilatonic variation of AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 , which is called\nthe \"Janusian\" background[19]. It would be interesting to ask if saturation is again possible for\nthis background.\nWe now ask the implication of the refined local version to the Bekenstein bound. For simplicity, let us consider the case when s is uniform. Then by a similar computation leading to\n(2.15), one finds\nS \u2264 \u03c0dE +\n\nS2\n4G\n4G d2\nA s2 = \u03c0dE +\n.\nD\u22122 2\n2(D \u2212 2) A\n\n(4.10)\n\nThe condition can be further solved in terms of S by\nS \u2264 \u03c0dE\n\n2\n1+\n\nq\n\n1\u2212\n\n8G \u03c0dE\nD\u22122 A\n\n= \u03c0dE +\n\n4G\n(\u03c0dE)2\n+ *** .\n2(D \u2212 2)\nA\n\n(4.11)\n\nClearly the correction is of order G/A, which comes up to our expectation. However we do\nnot understand its physical origin. Further clarification of the refined local Bekenstein bound is\nnecessary.\n\n\u2013 13 \u2013\n\n\f5. Discussions\nIn this note, we considered dimensional reduction of the lightlike holography from D + 1 geometry of the form M \u00d7 S 1 . With a warping factor, the local Bekenstein bound in D + 1\ndimensions leads to a more refined form of the local Bekenstein bound from the view point of\nthe D dimensional geometry. With a KK gauge field, dimensional reduction leads to the stronger\nbound where the energy momentum tensor contribution is replaced by the energy momentum\ntensor with the electromagnetic contribution subtracted. This local version is consistent with\nthe previously proposed modification of the Bekenstein bound in the presence of a non-vanishing\nelectromagnetic charge.\nWith the order G correction of the refined local Bekenstein bound, we argued that saturation of the holography bound is now quite possible even for nonvanishing expansions. For the\nAdS/CFT discussed in the introduction, we showed that the regulated boundary area divided\n4G agrees with the degrees of freedom of the boundary CFT.\nThere has been some challenge in finding examples violating the Bekenstein bound. Our\nproposal suggests that one way to find a violation of the original version is to look for possible\ncorrections of order G. Further understanding of the refined version of the local Bekenstein\nbound would be very interesting.\n\nAcknowledgment\nWe are grateful to Seok Kim for the contributions at the earlier stage of this work.
