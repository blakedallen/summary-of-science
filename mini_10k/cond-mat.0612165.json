It has been\nrecognized now that coupled spin chains including spin\ntubes offer fairly richer physics compared with single spin\nchains.12 Recently, a few new spin-tube compounds such\nas a three-leg tube6 [(CuCl2 tachH)3 Cl]Cl2 and a nineleg one5 Na2 V3 O7 have been fabricated. The presence of\nthese materials has further promoted the study of spin\ntubes.\nFor nonfrustrated AF spin-S ladders\u2212namely, coupled AF chains with an open boundary condition for\nthe rung\u2212the following universal feature (generalization of Haldane's prediction) has been elucidated:13,14,15\nif both 2S and the number of chains, N , are odd,\nthe low-energy physics is described by a gapless, onecomponent Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) and no\nsymmetry breakings take place, whereas for all the other\ncases (2S\u00d7N = even), the system has a gapped spectrum\nwith conserving all symmetries. This even-odd property,\nhowever, does not always hold in frustrated coupled spin\nchains. In the three-leg AF spin- 21 tube where the rung\ntriangle induces geometrical frustration, it is known1 that\nthe one-site translational symmetry along the chain direction is spontaneously broken and a finite gap between\na ground state and the lowest excitation exists.\nIn this paper, we point out another striking difference\nbetween the three-leg nonfrustrated ladder and the frustrated tube: namely, utilizing bosonization techniques,\nwe show in a clear way that a vector chiral long-range\norder resides in the magnetic-field-induced TLL phase\nof the three-leg AF spin- 21 tube at least in the weakrung-coupling regime. In the chiral phase, the parity\nsymmetry for the rung direction is spontaneously bro-\n\nken. On the contrary, the chiral order is absent in\nthe corresponding ladder. For one-dimensional gapped\nU (1)-symmetric coupled spin chains, (i) the field-induced\nmagnon-condensed gapless state is usually described by a\nstandard TLL and conserves all symmetries and (ii) many\nphysicists have focused only on whether nontrivial magnetization plateau states exist or not. Therefore, the possibility of chirality in spin tubes has not been considered\nwell so far.16 We also show that the chiral order continues\nin the intermediate plateau state of the spin tube. These\npredictions means that the three-leg spin tube possesses\nboth gapless and gapped chiral-ordered states. We further discuss a rung-coupling modification in the three-leg\nspin tube: the strength of one bond of three rung couplings is changed. If the strength of the changed bond is\nextremely increased (decreased), the system approaches\na two-leg ladder plus single chain (a three-leg ladder).\nBoth limits possess no geometrical frustration. Interestingly, it is found that in the case of increasing the bond\nstrength, the chiral order always remains unbroken, but\nan Ising-type quantum phase transition takes place and\nthe chirality disappears at the Ising critical point in the\nother case.\nThe organization of the paper is as follows. In Sec. II,\nwe define a spin tube model and briefly explain the\nbosonization method. The next two sections are the main\npart of the paper. We show the mechanism of the vector\nchiral order in Sec. III. Section IV is devoted to investigating effects of the rung deformation. Finally, conclusions and brief discussions about our results are presented\nin Sec. V.\n\nII.\n\nMODEL AND METHOD\n\nIn this paper, we mainly consider the three-leg AF\nspin- 21 tube with a homogeneous rung coupling. The\n\n\f2\n\n\u03b82\n\nHamiltonian is defined as\nH=\n\n3 Xh\nX\n\nn=1 j\n\n~n,j is spin- 1 operator on site j of the nth chain\nwhere S\n2\n(n = 1-3), J > 0 (J\u22a5 > 0) is the AF intrachain\n~4,j = S\n~1,j is imposed.\n(rung) coupling, and the PBC S\nWe begin with the independent three chains in a field\nH. From Abelian bosonization,12 the nth chain in the\nlimit is mapped to a \u0003Gaussian model Hn =\n\u0002\nRlow-energy\ndx v2 K(\u2202x \u03b8n )2 + K \u22121 (\u2202x \u03c6n )2 , where \u03c6n is the scalar\nboson field and \u03b8n is the dual to \u03c6n . The TLL parameter K and the spin-wave velocity v depend on J and\nH; when H is changed from 0 to the saturation field 2J,\nv (K) monotonically decreases (increases) from \u03c0Ja0 /2\n(1/2) to 0 (1) [a0 : lattice constant].

We stress here that almost\nall the discussions below are applicable to other threeleg spin tubes with symmetry-conserved perturbations\n(XXZ anisotropy, further-neighbor interactions, etc.).\nIII.\n\nVECTOR CHIRAL ORDER\n\n\u221a\nP\nLet us introduce\n\u221a new boson fields \u03a60 = \u221an \u03c6n / 3,\n\u03a6 = (\u03c6\n\u221a1 \u2212 \u03c63 )/ 2, \u03a62 = (\u03c6\n\u221a1 + \u03c63 \u2212 2\u03c62 )/ 6, \u03980 =\nP1\n\u03b8\n/\n3,\n\u0398\n=\n(\u03b8\n\u2212\n\u03b8\n)/\n2, and \u03982 = (\u03b81 + \u03b83 \u2212\nn\n1\n1\n3\nn \u221a\n2\u03b82 )/ 6. The relationship between old and new bosons is\nillustrated in Fig. 1. As one will see later, these fields help\nus to detect a vector chiral order. Using these new fields,\nwe can diagonalize the boson bilinear part in Eq. (3).\nConsequently, the effective Hamiltonian is rewritten as\nHeff =\n\nn\n\ni\n\u221a\nA2\n+ 1 cos( 4\u03c0(\u03c6n \u2212 \u03c6n+1 )) + * * * ,\n2\n\n\u03980\n\n(2b)\n\nz\nwhere M (H) = hSn,j\ni, and Al and Bl are nonuniversal constants of O(1).17,18 This\nformula indicates that\n\u221a \u221a\nthe period of \u03c6n (\u03b8n ) is \u03c0 ( 4\u03c0). Using Hn and formula (2), we can straightforwardly derive the following\neffective Hamiltonian of the model (1) in the weak-rungcoupling regime:\n\nHeff =\n\nC\n\ni\nz\n~n,j * S\n~n+1,j \u2212 HSn,j\n~n,j * S\n~n,j+1 + J\u22a5 S\n,(1)\nJS\n\nZ\n\ndx\n\nwhere \u03c64 = \u03c61 , \u03b84 = \u03b81 , and we have written only the\nimportant part among all the rung-coupling terms and\nneglected terms with oscillating factors eli\u03c0Mj or (\u22121)j ,\nwhich are irrelevant.

This is strongly\nsupported by symmetries of the tube. The \u03a60 sector\nhence provides a one-component TLL. The derivative\nterm \u2202x \u03a60 can be absorbed into the Gaussian part and\nyields only a small correction of M . On the other hand,\nthe remaining \u03a61,2 sectors are subject to the effect of the\npotential V . Since the scaling dimensions of V [\u03a61 , \u03a62 ]\nand V [\u03981 , \u03982 ] are, respectively, evaluated as 2Kg and\n1/(2Kg ), the latter V [\u03981 , \u03982 ] is always dominant and\nrelevant [i.e., 1/(2Kg ) < 2] from a small M to the saturation. The phase fields \u03981 and \u03982 thus are pinned at\nthe minimum of V [\u03981 , \u03982 ], and \u03a61,2 sectors have massive spectra. Consequently, the low-energy physics of the\ntube (1) is governed by a TLL in the \u03a60 sector. The\nTLL just corresponds to the known field-induced critical\nphase.3 [For the case of M = 0, eli\u03c0Mj = 1 and relevant vertex operators with \u03a60 appear in Eq. (4). They\nare expected to cause the \u03a60 sector to obtain a gapped\nspectrum.]\nThe scenario leading to the TLL here is already known\nwell.3,19 However, as one will see below, characteristics\nof the frustrated spin tube (1) are hidden in the form\nof the potential V . Figure 2(a) and\npshow that\n\u221a Eq. (5)\nsix minimum\npoints (\u03981 , \u03982 ) = (\u00b1 2\u03c0/3, \u00b1 2\u03c0/3) and\n\u221a\n(\u00b12 2\u03c0/3, 0) lie around the origin (0, 0). [Inversely,\n(0, 0) is the unique minimum of the potential J\u22a5 V for\nJ\u22a5 < 0.] Not all, however, are physically meaningful, because phase fields \u03b8n have a period. \u221a\nProjecting\nthe phys\u221a\n\u221a\nically relevant cubic space \u03b8n \u2208 [\u2212 \u03c0, \u03c0] (mod 4\u03c0)\nonto the \u03981 -\u03982 plane (see Fig. 1), we obtain a diamond\nzone as in Fig. 2(b). Therefore, it is enough\np\n\u221a to consider\n2\u03c0/3, 2\u03c0/3)\nonly two minimum points (\u0398\u00b1\n,\n\u0398\n)\n=\n(\u00b1\n2\n1\n\u2212\nthat satisfy \u0398+\n1 = \u2212\u03981 6= 0. Since the rung-parity transformation (\u03c61 , \u03b81 ) \u2194 (\u03c63 , \u03b83 ) causes \u03981 \u2192 \u2212\u03981 , pinning\n\u03981 to these two minima implies the spontaneous breakdown of the rung-parity symmetry. As a candidate of\nthe rung-parity order parameter, we can propose a vec~n,j \u00d7 S\n~n+1,j , which changes sign via\ntor chirality ~\u03ban,j = S\nthe rung-parity operation. From the formula (2), the z\ncomponent of a chirality is evaluated as\n\u0011E\nD \u0010\u221a\n2\u03c0\u03981 + * * * = \u2213 finite,\nh\u03baz3,j i \u2248 \u2212B02 sin\n\n(7)\n\nfor \u0398\u00b1\n1 . Remarkably, the leading term of the chirality does not contain the massless fields (\u03a60 , \u03980 ). Similarly, h\u03baz1(2),j i are shown to be equivalent to h\u03baz3,j i.\nWe thus conclude that the vector chiral long-range order exists in the field-induced TLL phase. The chirality correlation function exhibits p\nan exponential decay:\nh\u03baz3,j \u03baz3,0 i \u2248 h\u03baz3,j i2 + C0 e\u2212|j|/\u03be / |j| + * * * . Since any\nartificial approximation such as a mean-field decoupling\nis not used to obtain Eq. (7), the prediction of the chiral\norder is highly reliable. Note that in the chiral phase,\nthe spontaneous breakdown of the Z2 rung-parity symmetry occurs, but the U (1) spin-rotational symmetry is\npreserved.\nFor the spin- 12 tube (1), it is predicted that the intermediate plateau state appears at M = 1/6 in the region\nc\nJ \u22a5 > J\u22a5\n(\u223c 0.1J).3 In the bosonization picture, the spin\ngap of the plateau state is interpreted as that of the \u03a60\nsector, which is \u221a\ninduced by a relevant higher-order\numk\u221a\nlapp term cos(4 3\u03c0\u03a60 + 12\u03c0M j) = cos(4 3\u03c0\u03a60 ). On\nthe other hand, the \u03a61,2 sectors are hardly influenced by\nwhether the \u03a60 sector obtains a gapped spectrum or not.\nTherefore, we predict that the chiral order still continues\nc\nin the intermediate plateau phase at least if J\u22a5 (> J\u22a5\n)\nis sufficiently small. This chiral plateau state is reminiscent of the narrow chiral phase in the classical AF XY\nmodel on a triangular lattice.20 It is noteworthy that by\ncontrolling the strength of the magnetic field, one can realize both gapless and gapped chiral states in single spin\ntube.\n\nIV.\n\nRUNG DEFORMATION\n\nIn this section, we discuss the rung deformation. Let\nus modify the coupling between the first and third chains\nas\n~1.j * S\n~3,j \u2192 J\u22a5 (1 + \u03b4)S\n~1.j * S\n~3,j .\nJ\u22a5 S\n\n(8)\n\nThis explicitly violates the rung translational symmetry, but conserves the parity symmetry between the first\nand third chains. Therefore, h\u03baz3,j i is still valid as a\nrung-parity order parameter. The cases of \u03b4 = \u22121\nand \u03b4 \u2192 +\u221e, respectively, correspond to a three-leg\nladder and a system of a two-leg ladder plus single\nchain. Note here that if we set J\u22a5 \u03b4 = const \u226a J, the\npresent weak-rung-coupling approach is available even\nfor the case of a large |\u03b4| \u226b 1. \u221aA finite \u03b4 brings new\nbosonic terms\u221a\u03b4J\u22a5 M \u2202x (\u03c61 +\u03c63 )/ \u03c0, \u03b4J\u22a5 a0 \u2202x \u03c61 \u2202x \u03c63 /\u03c0,\n\u03b4J\u22a5 B02 a0 cos( 2\u03c0\u03981 ), etc. The first term can be absorbed into the Gaussian part via the shift of \u03a6q , which\ndoes not affect dual fields \u0398q and yields a small deviation\nz\nz\nfrom the uniform magnetization, hS2,j\ni 6= hS1(3),j\ni. It is\nnot surprising because (as mentioned above) \u03b4 breaks the\nrung translational symmetry. The second boson bilinear\nterm is expected not to qualitatively influence the lowenergy physics. Actually, introducing a new basis different from (\u03a6q , \u0398q ), we can diagonalize all the bilinear\n\n\f4\n\u03b4=\u22120.3\n\n\u03982\n\n\u03b4=0.5\n4SJ+SJ\u22a5 (3/2-\u03b4/2)\n+SJ\u22a5 (1+\u03b4)2 +8\n\n2\n\n\u03981\n\n1\n0\n\nH\nsaturation\n\n4SJ+3SJ\u22a5 + SJ\u22a5\u03b4\n\n4SJ\n\n-1\n-2\n\n\u03b4=\u22120.7\n\n\u03b4=1.0\n\nTL liquid\nwithout\nchiral order\n\n2\n1\n\nTL liquid +\nvector chiral order\nIsing transition\n\n0\n-1\n\n-0.5=\u03b4gapped\ncl\n0\nphase\n\n-2\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\nFIG. 3: Deformed potential V\u03b4 [\u03981 , \u03982 ].\n\nterms. The main effect of the rung modification originates from the third cosine term which varies the form\nof the potential V [\u03981 , \u03982 ] as follows:\nV [\u03981 , \u03982 ] \u2192 V\u03b4 [\u03981 , \u03982 ] =\n(9)\n\u0010r \u03c0 \u0011\n\u0010r 3\u03c0 \u0011\n\u0010\u221a\n\u0011\n2 cos\n2\u03c0\u03981 .\n\u03981 cos\n\u03982 + (1 + \u03b4) cos\n2\n2\nThe deformed potential V\u03b4 is illustrated in Fig. 3. From\nV\u03b4 , one finds that when \u03b4 increases [decreases and reaches\n\u03b4cl = \u22120.5], the two minimum points still survive with\nkeeping \u03981 6= 0p\n[approach with each other and meet at\n(\u03981 , \u03982 ) = (0, 2\u03c0/3)]. The chirality h\u03baz3,j i is hence\nshown to be always finite when an arbitrary positive \u03b4 is\napplied. In other words, once an infinitesimal exchange\nis added between a two-leg AF ladder and single chain,\na vector chiral order immediately emerges. On the other\nhand, for the case of \u03b4 < 0, the vector chiral order is\npredicted to vanish at a certain point \u03b4 = \u03b4c and the lowenergy physics is described by the TLL of the \u03a60 sector\nfor \u03b4 < \u03b4c . The true value of \u03b4c must be renormalized\nfrom the classical value \u03b4cl by the effect of the Gaussian\npart and must depend on J\u22a5 /J and H/J.\nIn order to further understand the physics near the\nphase transition at \u03b4 = \u03b4c , it is necessary\np to go beyond\nthe semiclassical analysis of V\u03b4 . If cos( 3\u03c0/2\u03982 ) in V\u03b4\nis allowed to be replaced with its expectation value, the\neffective Hamiltonian for the \u03a61 sector is written as the\nfollowing double sine-Gordon (dSG) model21,22 :\nZ\n\u0003\n\u0002\nH[\u03a61 ,\u03981 ] \u2248 dx Kg (\u2202x \u03981 )2 + Kg\u22121 (\u2202x \u03a61 )2\nr\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u221a\n\u0001\n\u03c0 \u0001\nJ\u22a5\n\u03981 \u2212 (1 + \u03b4) cos 2\u03c0\u03981 , (10)\n\u2212 B02 C1 cos\na0\n2\np\nwhere C1 = hcos( 3\u03c0/2\u03982 )i. It is believed that for\nKg > 1/4, the dSG model exhibits a second-order Ising\ntransition by tuning the coupling constants. Indeed, as\n\u03b4 passes through a critical value \u03b4c , the potential of the\ndSG model changes from a double-well type to a singlebottom one. We thus conclude that the transition at\n\u03b4 = \u03b4c is in the Ising universality class. The semiclassical\n\n0.5 \u03b4\n\nwith translational symmetry broken\nc\n) is fixed\nFIG. 4: Phase diagram of the spin- 12 tube. J\u22a5 (< J\u22a5\nin the weak-rung-couping regime. The bosonization approach\nis less valid near both the lower and the upper critical fields.\nThe upper critical field here is evaluated by the energy dispersion of one magnon.\n\nanalysis of V\u03b4 becomes more reliable with V\u03b4 being more\nrelevant. It is hence expected that the value \u03b4c monotonically decreases and approaches \u03b4cl when Kg (\u2248 K)\nincreases\u2212i.e., when H becomes close to the upper critical field. Equation (3.11) and Fig. 12 in Ref. 22 also\nsupport this prediction.\u221a\n\u221a\nSince h\u03baz3,j i \u221d hsin( 2\u03c0\u03981 )i \u2248 2\u03c0h\u03981 i holds near\nthe transition, the chirality would play the role of the\nIsing order parameter. Comparing our dSG model (10)\nand results [Eqs. (29) and (58)] in Ref. 21, we can find\nh\u03baz3,j i \u223c (\u03b4 \u2212 \u03b4c )1/8 ,\n\n(11)\n\nnear \u03b4 \u2192 \u03b4c + 0. [The mean-field analysis of V\u03b4 leads\nto h\u03baz3,j i \u223c (\u03b4 \u2212 \u03b4c )1/2 .] The chirality correlation function behaves as h\u03baz3,j \u03baz3,0 i \u223c C2 /|j|1/4 just at the critical\npoint. Moreover, near the point, it follows the results in\nRef. 23.\nSakai et al. have recently predicted that when \u03b4 is\nadded to the spin tube in zero field, the spin gap rapidly\ndisappears.24 Combining this prediction and ours, we\nconstruct the phase diagram on the \u03b4-H plane as in\nFig. 4.\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSIONS\n\nWe have studied the three-leg AF spin- 21 tube (1) with\na weak rung coupling under a magnetic field making use\nof Abelian bosonization techniques. In Sec. III, we have\ndefinitely elucidated without the help of any artificial\napproximation that the vector chiral long-range order\noccurs in the magnetic-field-driven one-component TLL\nphase. Due to the chiral order, the discrete rung-parity\nsymmetry is spontaneously broken, but the U (1) spinrotational symmetry remains unbroken. We have also\nbeen predicted that the chiral order survives even in the\nintermediate plateau state with M = 1/6. It is remarkable that one can obtain both gapless and gapped chiral\n\n\f5\nstates by changing the strength of the magnetic field. In\nSec. IV, we have investigated effects of the rung deformation in Eq. (8). It has been shown that when a positive \u03b4 is introduced with fixing J\u22a5 \u03b4 the chiral order and\nthe TLL always continue, whereas when \u03b4 is decreased\nthe chiral order vanishes at a certain Ising critical point\n\u03b4 = \u03b4c < 0 and then a standard TLL phase appears (see\nFig. 4). This implies that vector chirality correlations are\nfavored in two-leg spin ladders25 as well as in three-leg\ntubes.\nQuite recently, based on the spin-wave picture, we have\npredicted that the same chiral order still survives a certain regime in the vicinity of saturation of the spin tube\nwith \u03b4 = 0.26 Therefore, it is inferred that the tube\npossesses the chiral order in a quite wide range of the\nmagnetic field. One immediately finds that the classical\nthree-leg spin tube always has a vector chiral order from\nthe zero field to the upper critical one. We thus may\nsay that the classical nature is strong in the weak-rungcoupling area of the quantum spin tube (1). Actually,\nas well known, the AF spin- 12 chain, which is the starting point of our analysis, has a large instability toward a\nclassical N\u00e9el ordering.\nThe discussion in this paper tells us that even without\nmagnetic fields, a vector chiral order could also occur\nif a spin tube consists of three spin chains with a large\nK(> 1/2): for instance, the condition K > 1/2 is satisfied in a chain with easy-plane XXZ anisotropy.

The chiral order\npredicted in this paper must be destroyed by an effect\nof thermal fluctuation. However, chirality correlations\nare expected to still be strong if the temperature is sufficiently low.

Four-point spin correlation functions\ninclude features of the above chiral order or strong chiral\ncorrelation. Such functions, in principle, are measured in\npolarized neutron scattering, electromagnetic-wave resonance, etc.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work is supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B) (No. 17340100) from the Ministry of\nEducation, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of\nJapan.\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\nRoncaglia, Phys.

Of course,\na spin tube Hamiltonian with such chiral terms does not\npossess the rung-parity symmetry, and the resulting finite\nexpectation value of vector chirality does not mean any\nspontaneous symmetry breaking.
