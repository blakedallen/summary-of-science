Phys.\nAndr\u00e9 Gsponer\nISRI-02-05 May 30, 2018\n\nAbstract\nRemarkably simple closed-form expressions for the elements of the\ngroups SU (n), SL(n, R), and SL(n, C) with n = 2, 3, and 4 are obtained using linear functions of biquaternions instead of n \u00d7 n matrices.\nThese representations do not directly generalize to SU (n > 4). However,\nthe quaternion methods used are sufficiently general to find applications in\nquantum chromodynamics and other problems which necessitate complicated 3 \u00d7 3 or 4 \u00d7 4 matrix calculations.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe continuous and compact groups SU(3) and SU(4) play important roles in\nphysics, especially in gauge theories of elementary particles interactions, and in\nthe classification of nuclear and hadronic states and resonances. However, while\nthe three-parameters group SU(2) is sufficiently simple to be easily formulated\nin various elegant forms using 2 \u00d7 2 matrices or quaternions [1], the published\nparametrizations of the eight-parameters group SU(3) are comparatively much\nmore complicated, e.g., references [2 \u2212 12].\nIn this paper, simple and explicit closed-form expressions for the elements of\nthe groups SU(n), SL(n, R), and SL(n, C) with n = 2, 3, and 4 are built using\nlinear functions of biquaternions instead of n \u00d7 n complex matrices.1 These expressions include \"Lie-type\" representations (in which the full set of Lie generators\nis explicitly used to write the general element of the group) and \"Euler-angles\"\n1\n\nTo avoid the frequent use of the adjective complex we will use the prefix bi- that was suggested\nby Hamilton to qualify complex numbers, vectors, and quaternions, i.e., elements of B = C \u2297 H.\n\n1\n\n\frepresentations (in which only a subset of the Lie generators is used). So far as\nwe know, our representations are new.\nSince linear biquaternion functions of biquaternions correspond to 4 \u00d7 4 complex matrices, the biquaternion representations presented in this paper are in fact\nequivalent to 4 \u00d7 4 matrix representations. This means, when representing for\nexample SU(3) with biquaternions, that the extraneous fourth dimension can be\nused as an auxiliary component to make the calculation of the group elements\neasier with quaternions than with 3 \u00d7 3 matrices. Thus, the essence of the method\napplied in this paper is equivalent to the seminal idea that lead to the discovery\nof quaternions by Hamilton in 1843, namely the concept that the multiplication\nand division of vectors (i.e., triplets of numbers) are only possible if an auxiliary\nnumber (the scalar part of the quaternion) is introduced to enable the calculation.\nAn interesting aspect of this method, i.e., using quaternions to provide a kind of\n\"algebraic continuation\" to facilitate 3\u00d73 matrix calculations, is that it is general.\nNot only are the calculations necessary to obtain the triplet representation of SU(3)\nelementary (and requiring only a basic knowledge of quaternion algebra) but the\nsame method may be used with similar efficiency to build higher dimensional\nrepresentations such as the octet, the decuplet, etc. Moreover, the method may be\napplied to various calculations in quantum chromodynamics, which are known to\nbe quite difficult, and to related problems in particle physics. Finally, as it happens\nwith the second of the two representation of SU(3) given in this paper, some\nquaternion expressions written for three-dimensional vectors keep their simplicity\nwhen generalized to four dimensions. This is how a concise expression is obtained\nfor the fifteen parameter group SU(4).\nOf course, the possibility of representing small groups such as SU(2), SO(3),\nand SO(4) with quaternions is well known. For instance, since the three parameters\ndefining a SU(2) group element can be assembled in the vector part of a real\nquaternion of unit norm exp( 21 \u03b1~a), the multiplicative group of such quaternions\nprovides a representation of SU(2). In this representation a column vector of\ncomplex numbers (x, y) is mapped onto a real quaternion q \u2208 H by the expression\n\u0001\n\u0001\nq = Re(x) + Im(x)e1 + Re(y) + Im(y)e1 e2\n(1)\nwhere e1 and e2 are any two out of the three quaternion units, and the corresponding\n2 \u00d7 2 matrix of SU(2) is represented by the real quaternion function2\n1\n\nMSU (2) ( ) = e 2 \u03b1~a [ ]\n2\n\n(2)\n\nThe round parentheses in the notation F ( ) designate that F is a function whose argument is\nconceived to occupy the place marked by ( ), while the square brackets [ ] are conceived to mark\nthe position to be occupied by a quaternion within a quaternion monomial, e.g., AB[ ]CD. This\nsuggestive notation due to Hamilton [13, p.359] was later promoted by Conway and Synge [14, 15].\n\n2\n\n\fwhere ~a =\n\nP3\n\nk=1\n\nak ek is a unit vectors and \u03b1 \u2208 R. Then\n1\n\nq \u2032 = MSU (2) (q) = e 2 \u03b1~a q\n\n(3)\n\nis an SU(2) transformation such that the invariant quaternion form q \u2032 q \u2032 = qq is\nthe counterpart of the Hermitian form (x\u2032 , y \u2032 )\u2020 (x\u2032 , y \u2032) = (x, y)\u2020 (x, y) = x\u2217 x + y \u2217 y\nwhich is invariant in the standard 2 \u00d7 2 complex matrix formalism. Unfortunately, this particularly elegant (and explicitly real) realization of SU(2) does not\ngeneralize to SU(3) and SU(4).\nIn the case of SO(3) and SO(4) one has the representations\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1 ~\n\nMSO(3) ( ) = e 2 \u03b1~a [ ]e\u2212 2 \u03b1~a ,\nand\n\nMSO(4) ( ) = e 2 \u03b1~a [ ]e\u2212 2 \u03b2 b ,\n\n(4)\n(5)\n\nwhich clearly show that these groups have three and six parameters, respectively.\nExpressions (2), (4), and (5) are elementary examples of linear functions of\nbiquaternions. As will be recalled in Sec. 2, any complex 4 \u00d7 4 matrix M can\nalways be replaced by the linear function M( ) : B \u2192 B isomorphic to M : C4 \u2192\nC4 . In such linear functions the argument is inserted in empty spaces which may\noccur (because of the noncommutativity of quaternions) anywhere within a linear\nexpression such as, e.g., M( ) = A[ ]B + [ ]C, where A, B, and C are quaternions.\nTherefore, to avoid possible confusion, a quaternion used as an operator (e.g., a\nlinear function) will always be written Q[ ] or [ ]Q, while a quaternion used as\nan operand (or a number in an expression) will always be written Q. Moreover,\nto reduce the proliferation of parentheses, and to make long expressions more\nreadable, the symbol \u2299 will be used to separate operators\u0001\u0001\naccording to the obvious\ncomposition rule, e.g., A[ ]B \u2299 C[ ] \u2299 [ ]D = A C [ ]D B = AC[ ]DB.\n\nThe representations (4) and (5) of the orthogonal groups SO(3) and SO(4)\nwill be of direct use in generalizing the well-known Euler-angles representation\nof SU(2) to SU(3) and SU(4). This will be possible because of Lanczos's\nfundamental decomposition theorem which states that any arbitrary, nonzero\nand possibly rectangular, real (complex) matrix C can be written as the product\nof an orthogonal (unitary) matrix A, a positive diagonal (phase) matrix D, and\nthe transpose (adjoint) of a second orthogonal (unitary) matrix B, i.e., [16]\nC = ADB t .\n\n(6)\n\nTherefore, any unitary matrix may be written as\nU = O1 D\u03c6 O2t\n3\n\n(7)\n\n\fwhere O1 , O2 are two general orthogonal matrices such as (4) or (5), and D\u03c6 a\ndiagonal phase matrix. However, while this decomposition is essentially unique\nbecause the two orthogonal matrices combined with the diagonal matrix have\nexactly the right number of independent parameters required to represent SU(n),\nit is not the only possible one. For instance, we will begin with a quaternionic\nparametrization of SU(3) corresponding to the decomposition\nU = OA D\u03c6 US\n\n(8)\n\nwhere OA corresponds to an orthogonal matrix and US to a particular unitary\nmatrix.\nThe outline of the paper is as follows. In Sec. 2 the linear quaternion functions\nequivalent to general symmetric, antisymmetric, and diagonal 3 \u00d7 3 and 4 \u00d7 4\nmatrices are given. In Sec. 3 the exponential maps of these functions are calculated.\nIn Sec. 4 these maps are used in a Lie-type representation of SU(3) corresponding\nto the decomposition (8). In Sec. 5 Euler-angles representations of SU(2), SU(3),\nand SU(4) are built according to the decomposition (7). Finally, in Sec. 6, the\nobtained representations are compared to various non-quaternion representations,\nsome hints for building further quaternions representations are given, and some\nadvantageous features of quaternion representations are highlighted.3\n\n2\n\nLinear functions and Conway operators\n\nThe most common language for expressing linear functions is that of matrices\nwith real or complex number elements. However, if hypercomplex numbers such\nas quaternions are used, it is possible to express any linear function corresponding\nto one 4 \u00d7 4 matrix (sixteen complex numbers) by a unique linear combination\nof sixteen elementary quaternion operators. Since the quaternion algebra is noncommutative, these so-called \"Conway operators\" are of the type en [ ]em where the\nempty space corresponds to the position of the argument, and where ek (k = 1, 2, 3)\nare the three quaternion units and e0 = 1 is the ordinary scalar unit [14, 15].\nP3\nFor instance, if the biquaternion Q =\nx with xn \u2208 C\nn=0 xn en = x0 + ~\nis used to represent a 4 \u00d7 1 column vector, the quaternion form of the general\n3\n\nThroughout this paper a number of equivalent representations of the same groups will be\nwritten. In order to simplify the notation, all the parameters, whether scalars {\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, ...} or\nvectors {~a, ~b, ~c, ...}, will be represented by the same symbols even though they may correspond to\ndifferent numerical values.\n\n4\n\n\fC4 \u2192 C4 linear function M( ) : Q 7\u2192 Q\u2032 =\nQ\u2032 = M(Q) =\n\nP3\n\n3 X\n3\nX\n\nn=0\n\nxn \u2032 en is then\n\nznm en [Q]em\n\n(9)\n\nn=0 m=0\n\nwhere znm \u2208 C, and Q, Q\u2032 \u2208 B. While this expression may seem cumbersome at\nfirst, its power stems from the fact is that many particular linear functions which\nare important in mathematics or physics have remarkably simple and elegant forms\nwhen they are expressed in terms of Conway operators.\nFor example, the linear function\n\u0010\n\u0011\nA{a1 ,a2 ,a3 } ( ) = ~a[ ] \u2212 [ ]~a ,\n1\n2\n\n(10)\n\ncorresponds to the upper-left 3 \u00d7 3 antisymmetric matrix\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n0 \u2212a3 +a2 0\n\uf8ec+a3 0 \u2212a1 0\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\u2212a2 +a1 0 0\uf8f8 .\n0\n0\n0 0\n\n(10\u2032)\n\ncorresponds to the general 4 \u00d7 4 antisymmetric matrix\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n0\n\u2212iB3 +iB2 E1\n\uf8ec+iB3\n0\n\u2212iB1 E1 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\u2212iB2 +iB1\n0\nE1 \uf8f8\n\u2212E1 \u2212E2 \u2212E3 0\n\n(11\u2032)\n\n\u0001\nThe linear function (10) directly generalizes to 21 ~a[ ] \u2212 [ ]~b which, written as\n\u0010\n\u0001\n\u0001\u0011\n1\n~\n~\n~\n~\nA{B,\n(\n)\n=\n,\n(11)\nE\n+\ni\nB\n[\n]\n+\n[\n]\nE\n\u2212\ni\nB\n~ E}\n~\n2\n\n~ \u00b1 iB\n~ for the parameters to\nwhere we have intentionally taken the combinations E\nstress that this matrix has the same form as the electromagnetic field tensor.\nSimilarly, the linear function\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1\nD{d1 ,d2 ,d3 } ( ) = 2 d1 e1 [ ]e1 + d2 e2 [ ]e2 + d3 e3 [ ]e3\n\ncorresponds to the general 4 \u00d7 4 traceless diagonal matrix\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\u2212d1 + d2 + d3\n0\n0\n0\n\uf8f7\n1\uf8ec\n0\nd1 \u2212 d2 + d3\n0\n0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n0\n0\nd1 + d2 \u2212 d3\n0\n2\n0\n0\n0\n\u2212(d1 + d2 + d3 )\n5\n\n(12)\n\n(12\u2032)\n\n\fwhich shows that (12) corresponds to an upper-left 3 \u00d7 3 traceless diagonal matrix\nwhen the three numbers dk are subject to the condition d1 + d2 + d3 = 0.\nFinally, the general diagonal-less 3 \u00d7 3 symmetric matrix can also be neatly\nexpressed in quaternions. Starting from the linear function 12 \u03bb~s[ ]~s, where ~s is a\nunit vector, one has simply to subtract a 4 \u00d7 4 diagonal function in order to remove\nthe diagonal terms. Therefore,\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u03bbS{s1 ,s2,s3 } ( ) = \u03bb 21 ~s[ ]~s \u2212 D{s21 ,s22 ,s23 } ( )\n(13)\ncorresponds to the diagonal-less symmetric matrix\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8eb\n0 t3 t2\n0 s1 s2 s1 s3 0\n\uf8ect3 0 t1\n\uf8ecs1 s2 0 s2 s3 0\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\u03bb\uf8ec\n\uf8eds1 s3 s2 s3 0 0\uf8f8 = \u03bb \uf8edt2 t1 0\n0 0 0\n0\n0\n0 0\n\n\uf8f6\n0\n0\uf8f7\n\uf8f7 .\n0\uf8f8\n0\n\n(13\u2032)\n\nThus, the components of the vector ~s can be calculated from the matrix elements\ntk by the formulas s21 = t2 t3 /t1 , s22 = t3 t1 /t2 , s23 = t1 t2 /t3 .\nUnfortunately, to obtain the quaternion equivalent of the general diagonal-less\n4 \u00d7 4 symmetric matrix, it is not enough to replace one of the vectors ~s in (13)\nby a different unit vector ~u because the resulting term 21 \u03bb~s[ ]~u would have only\nfive independent\nparameters,\njust like the electromagnetic energy-moment tensor\n\u0001\n\u0001\n1 ~\n~ [] E\n~ \u2212 iB\n~ . The correct generalization of (13) is\nE\n+\ni\nB\n2\n\u0010\n\u0011\nS{\u03c3,\u03bd,~s,~u} ( ) = D{\u03c3,\u03bd} ( ) \u2299 12 ~s[ ]~u \u2212 D{s1 u1 ,s2 u2 ,s3u3 } ( ) \u2299 D{\u03c3,\u03bd} ( )\n(14)\n\nwhere the diagonal function D{\u03c3,\u03bd} ( ) = \u03c3S[ ]+\u03bdV[ ] produces a rescaling between\nthe scalar and vector parts of the operand. As a result, equation (14) is somewhat\ncumbersome and not very useful.\n\nIn conclusion - since any matrix can be expressed by the sum of a symmetric,\nan antisymmetric, and a diagonal matrix - the general 3 \u00d7 3 traceless matrix can,\naccording to (10 \u2212 13), always be represented by the expression\nM( ) = \u03bbS{s1 ,s2 ,s3} ( ) + A{a1 ,a2 ,a3 } ( ) + D{d1 ,d2 ,d3 } ( ) .\n\n(15)\n\nMoreover, if the diagonal term in the symmetric function (13) is merged with the\ndiagonal function (12), the final expression\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1\n1\n(16)\nM( ) = 2 \u03bb~s[ ]~s + 2 ~a[ ] \u2212 [ ]~a + D{d1 \u2212\u03bbs21 ,d2 \u2212\u03bbs22 ,d3 \u2212\u03bbs23 } ( )\n\nprovides a neat quaternion representation of a traceless C3 \u2192 C3 linear function\n~v 7\u2192 v~\u2032 characterized by the parameters \u03bb, sk , ak , and dk subject to the conditions\n6\n\n\fs21 + s22 + s23 = 1 and d1 + d2 + d3 = 0. However, this expression does not\nconveniently generalize to arbitrary traceless C4 \u2192 C4 linear functions - an\nillustration of the loss of power of the quaternion method when going from a three\nto a four dimensional problem.\n\n3\n\nExponential maps of S(), A(), and D()\n\nIn order for the functions S( ), A( ), and D( ) to be useful representations of the\ngenerators of the Lie algebras corresponding to SU(3) and SU(4) it is necessary\nthat these quaternion functions lead to elementary analytical expressions when\ntheir respective exponential maps are summed to go from infinitesimal to finite\ngroup transformations. Moreover, since SU(3) and SU(4) are compact groups, it\nis necessary that these expressions are themselves \"compact,\" i.e., expressible in\nterms of trigonometric functions only.\nFor instance, in the case of the antisymmetric function A( ), we have to calculate\n\u0010\n\u0011\nEXP \u03b1A{a1 ,a2 ,a3 } ( ) = EXP 12 \u03b1 ~a[ ] \u2212 [ ]~a\n(17)\n\nwhere ~a is a unit vector, \u03b1 a real parameter, and (following the convention of\nGilmore) the symbol EXP designates the Taylor series corresponding to the Lie\nexpansion of the group near the origin [1]. Obviously, the result is well-known.\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u00012\n\u00012\nIndeed, because the commutator ~a[ ], [ ]~a = 0, and ~a[ ] = [ ]~a = \u22121[ ], we\nget\n\u0010\n\u0011\nEXP 12 \u03b1 ~a[ ] \u2212 [ ]~a = exp( \u03b12 ~a)[ ] exp(\u2212 \u03b12 ~a)\n(18)\nwhich is nothing but equation (4), the celebrated Olinde-Rodrigues formula for\nspatial rotations in quaternion form [17].\n\nThe case of the diagonal function D( ) is also trivial. In effect, since the Conway\noperators in the diagonal function (12) commute with each other, it comes\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nEXP iD{\u03b41 ,\u03b42 ,\u03b43 } ( ) =\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\ni\ni\n\u2299 exp \u03b42 2 e2 [ ]e2 \u2299 exp \u03b43 2 e3 [ ]e3\n\nexp \u03b41 2i e1 [ ]e1\n(19)\n\u00012\nwhere, because ek [ ]ek = +1[ ] instead of \u22121[ ], dk has been replaced by i\u03b4k in\norder to obtain a result that is \"compact\" when \u03b4 is real.\nThe case of the diagonal-free symmetric function S( ) is slightly more complicated. This is because the exponential map\n\u0011\n\u0010\n1~ ~\n(20)\nEXP i\u03b2S{b1 ,b2 ,b3 } ( ) = EXP i\u03b2 2 b[ ]b \u2212 D{b21 ,b22 ,b23 } ( )\n7\n\n\fdoes not lead to a simple expression. However, the first term in the exponent does\nimmediately lead to\nEXP 21 i\u03b2~b[ ]~b = exp 12 i\u03b2~b[ ]~b\n(21)\n\u00012\nwhere, because ~b[ ]~b = +1[ ] when ~b is a unit vector, the imaginary unit i has\nbeen introduced to obtain a \"compact\" result when \u03b2 is real .\nThus, while only the last two terms of (15) lead to a simple exponential map, all\nthree terms of (16) have such a property. This suggests that the later representation\nshould be used when calculating the EXPonential of a traceless linear function.\n\n4\n\nQuaternionic \"Lie-type\" representations of\nSU (3), SL(3, R), and SL(3, C)\n\nIt is evident from their matrix representations (10\u2032 \u2212 13\u2032 ) that the linear functions\nA( ), S( ), and D( ) introduced in the preceding section to obtain compact expressions for the exponential maps can be related to the Lie generators of SU(3)\nby simple algebraic expressions. These relations are given in Table 1 for the\nGell-Mann parametrization of SU(3).\nTherefore, according to the general theorem of Lie relating the generators of a\nLie algebra to the elements of its corresponding group we have the canonical map\n\u0010\n\u0011\nGC ( ) = EXP \u03b1A{a1 ,a2 ,a3 } ( ) + i\u03b2S{b1 ,b2 ,b3 } ( ) + iD{\u03b41 ,\u03b42 ,\u03b43 } ( )\n(22)\n\nwhere the exponent corresponds to the general expression (15) for a trace-less\nlinear function. Unfortunately, just like in 3 \u00d7 3 matrix representations, this map\ndoes not lead to a simple closed-form expression for the group elements. But, if\nwe use the results of the preceding section, we immediately see that if equation\n(16) is used instead of (15) we get a representation that is fully expressible in\nterms of elementary functions. In effect, if using the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorf\ntheorem [1, 18] the expression\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0001\n1~ ~\n1\nEXP i\u03b2 2 b[ ]b + \u03b1 2 ~a[ ] \u2212 [ ]~a + iD{\u03b41 \u2212\u03b2b21 ,\u03b42 \u2212\u03b2b22 ,\u03b43 \u2212\u03b2b23 } ( )\n(23)\n\nis written as the composition of three EXPonential factors\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\nEXP i \u03b22~b[ ]~b \u2299 EXP \u03b12 ~a[ ] \u2212 [ ]~a \u2299 EXP iD{\u03b41 \u2212\u03b2b21 ,\u03b42 \u2212\u03b2b22 ,\u03b43 \u2212\u03b2b23 } ( ) (24)\n\nwe get a non-canonical representation of SU(3) which, according to (18), (19),\nand (21), is simply\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u03b2 ~ ~\n\u03b1\n(25)\nGSU (3) ( ) = exp 2 ib[ ]b \u2299 exp 2 ~a[ ] \u2212 [ ]~a \u2299 exp iD{\u03b41 ,\u03b42 ,\u03b43 ,\u03b2,~b} ( )\n8\n\n\fwhere\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n2 i\nexp iD{\u03b41 ,\u03b42 ,\u03b43 ,\u03b2,~b} ( ) = exp (\u03b41 \u2212 \u03b2b1 ) 2 e1 [ ]e1 \u2299\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\nexp (\u03b42 \u2212 \u03b2b22 ) 2i e2 [ ]e2 \u2299 exp (\u03b43 \u2212 \u03b2b23 ) 2i e3 [ ]e3\n\n(26)\n\nEquations (25, 26) are final fully explicit expressions for SU(3) group elements.\nAll parameters are real and reduce to eight independent ones because of the\nconditions a21 + a22 + a23 = b21 + b22 + b23 = 1 and \u03b41 + \u03b42 + \u03b43 = 0. If the imaginary\nunits i are suppressed in (25, 26), the resulting equations give a representation\nof the non-compact groups SL(3, R) when all parameters are real, and SL(3, C)\nwhen they are complex.\nFor these representations it is important to remark that the order of the exponentials in (25) is immaterial - although every permutation gives another element\nof the group. In particular, the inverse element is not simply obtained by changing\nthe signs in the exponents, the order of the exponential factors has to be reversed\nat the same time. For instance,\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u03b2 ~ ~\n\u22121\n\u03b1\nGSU (3) ( ) = exp \u2212iD{\u03b41 ,\u03b42 ,\u03b43 ,\u03b2,~b} ( ) \u2299exp 2 [ ]~a\u2212~a[ ] \u2299exp \u2212 2 ib[ ]b . (27)\nTherefore, comparing with (25), and writing ( )+ for biconjugation (i.e., the combination of imaginary and quaternion conjugations) and ( )\u2248 for function association,4 the inverse of any SU(3) group element can be written\n\u2020\n+\u2248\nG\u22121\nSU (3) ( ) = GSU (3) ( ) = GSU (3) ( )\n\n(28)\n\nwhich implies that ( )+\u2248 is the quaternion equivalent of Hermitian conjugation ( )\u2020 .\nHence, using the definition of function association, we immediately verify that the\nrepresentation\n(25) conserves\nthe Hermitian form S[X + Y ], i.e., that\n\u0002 +\n\u0003 as expected\n+\n+\nS GSU (3) (X ) GSU (3) (Y ) = S[X Y ].\n\n5\n\nQuaternionic \"Euler-angles\" representations of\nSU (3) and SU (4)\n\nThe most common parametrizations of finite three-dimensional rotations and spin 21\ntransformations are based on the particular matrix representation\n4\n\nU{\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b3} = exp(i\u03b1J3 ) exp(i\u03b2J2 ) exp(i\u03b3J3 )\n\n(29)\n\nFunction association (called function conjugation by Hamilton [13,\n\u0001\u2248 p.555]), which reverses\nthe order of all operations in a linear\nfunction,\ne.g.,\nab[\n]cd\n\u2299\nef\n[\n]gh\n= gh[ ]ef \u2299 cd[ ]ab, is\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0003\ndefined by the scalar equation S F (X) Y = S X F \u2248 (Y ) where F \u2248 ( ) is the associate of the\nlinear function F ( ).\n\n9\n\n\fin which only two out of the three Lie generators of SU(2) appear, and where\n{\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3} are the standard Euler-angles defined in many textbooks, e.g., [19]. The\nadvantage of this representation is that the diagonal Pauli matrix J3 is used twice\nso that the resulting matrix is of maximum simplicity, i.e.,\n!\n1\n1\ne 2 i(\u2212\u03b1\u2212\u03b3) cos 21 \u03b2 \u2212e 2 i(\u2212\u03b1+\u03b3) sin 12 \u03b2\nU{\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b3} = \u00b1\n.\n(29\u2032)\n1\n1\ni(+\u03b1\u2212\u03b3)\ni(+\u03b1+\u03b3)\n1\n1\ne2\nsin 2 \u03b2 +e 2\ncos 2 \u03b2\nHowever, if the objective is to work with a representation that can be generalized\nto higher dimensional unitary groups it is better to use\n\u2032\nU{\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b3}\n= exp(i\u03b1J2 ) exp(i\u03b2J3 ) exp(i\u03b3J2 ) .\n\n(30)\n\nIf the first and the second quaternion vector coordinates are chosen to represent\nthe SU(2) doublet as q = xe1 + ye2 , and if the corresponding Pauli matrices are\nexpressed by means of formulas (10, 10\u2032) and (12, 12\u2032), the quaternion equivalent\nof (30) is\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\u0001\nU{\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b1} ( ) = e 2 \u03b1e3 [ ]e\u2212 2 \u03b1e3 \u2299 exp i \u03b22 e1 [ ]e1 \u2212 e2 [ ]e2 \u2299 e 2 \u03b3e3 [ ]e\u2212 2 \u03b3e3 (30\u2032)\n\nwhose simplicity is comparable to that of the matrix (29\u2032). But (30\u2032 ) has the\nadditional advantage to correspond to Lanczos's decomposition (7) with two orthogonal function of the form (4), and\n\u0001 a unitary phase diagonal function of the form\n(12), i.e., D\u03c6 = exp iD{\u03b2,\u2212\u03b2,0} ( ) . Hence, according to (7), the generalization\nof (30\u2032 ) to SU(3) is therefore\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1\n1 ~\n1 ~\n1\nUSU (3) ( ) = e 2 \u03b1~a [ ]e\u2212 2 \u03b1~a \u2299 exp iD{\u03b2,\u03b3,\u2212\u03b2\u2212\u03b3} ( ) \u2299 e 2 \u03b4b [ ]e\u2212 2 \u03b4b\n(31)\nwhich has eight parameters: four phase \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4, and four angles in the two unit\nvectors ~a and ~b.\n\nThe next level of generalization is also trivial: SU(4) is obtained by replacing\nthe two SO(3) factors by two SO(4) functions of the form (5), and by using for\nD\u03c6 the general trace-less diagonal function (12). It comes\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1\n1 ~\n1 ~\n1\n(32)\nUSU (4) ( ) = e 2 \u03b1~a [ ]e\u2212 2 \u03b2 b \u2299 exp iD{\u03b3,\u03b4,\u01eb} ( ) \u2299 e 2 \u03c8~c[ ]e\u2212 2 \u03b7d\nwhich has fifteen parameters: seven phases and eight angles.\n\nFinally, expression (30\u2032) can be rewritten in a general form by replacing the\nquaternion units by three orthogonal unit vectors ~u, ~v , and w\n~ = ~u \u00d7 ~v.

Moreover, if\nthe imaginary factor i is suppressed we get similar representations for the corresponding groups SL(n, R) or SL(n, C) when all the parameters are either real or\ncomplex. Finally, it is easy to generalize or specialize between these formulas, as\nwell as to isolate various unitary, orthogonal, or Abelian subgroups.\n\n6\n\nDiscussion\n\nConsidering that the groups SU(3) and SU(4) depend on eigth or fifteen parameters, it is remarquable that explicit expressions such as (25, 26) and (31, 32) are\npossible, and that only trigonometric functions and a few quaternion multiplications are needed to calculate any group element. However, due to the fact that\ninfinitely many equivalent parametrizations are possible for any Lie group, the\nmerits of our quaternionic parametrizations have to be judged in view of possible\napplications, and in comparison with other published parametrizations, that we\nwill briefly review.\n\"Lie-type\" representations\nA first class of representations comprise those which use explicitly the full\nset {\u03bbn } of the Lie generators \u0001so that any group element is expressed by a map\nG( ) = G \u03c01 \u03bb1 ( ), ..., \u03c0N \u03bbN ( ) where \u03c0n is the parameter associated with the\ninfinitesimal generator \u03bbn ( ), and N the total number of generators, i.e., N = 8\nfor SU(3).\nCanonical form: The group element is expressed as the EXPonential of the\nlinear combination \u03c0 * \u03bb ( ), i.e.,\n\u0001\n\nGC ( ) = EXP \u03c0 * \u03bb ( ) := EXP\n\nN\nX\nk=1\n\n\u0001\n\u03c0n \u03bbn ( ) .\n\n(34)\n\nUnfortunately, the infinite series of terms implied by the EXP symbol is usually\nvery difficult to be summed in closed form. In particular, while the series lead\nto expression (2) in the case of SU(2), a comparably simple formula has not yet\nbeen obtained for SU(3).\nNon-canonical forms: As a consequence of the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff\ntheorem [1, 18] it is possible to break-down the canonical form into a product of\n\n11\n\n\fEXPonentials such as\nGN ( ) = EXP\n\nm1\nX\nn=1\n\nN\nX\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03c0n \u03bbn ( ) \u2299 ... \u2299 EXP\n\u03c0n \u03bbn ( )\n\n(35)\n\nn=mk\n\nwith the hope that the EXPonentials could be summed in a closed form. This is\nwhat we have done in equation (24) in order to get a product of three EXPonentials\n(the three diagonal exponentials are counted as a single one since they are trivial).\nIn fact, the best that has been achieved so far in the case of SU(3) was to find\na closed form expression for a two EXPonentials representation in which the\nnon-diagonal generators were merged in one EXPonential that was laboriously\nevaluated using a combination of matrix recurrence relations and Laplace transform\ntechniques [9]. However, it is not impossible (by using more involved techniques\nthen those of the present paper) that a similar result could be achieved with\nquaternions - and that even the canonical form could be summed this way.\nProduct form: An extreme non-canonical form is obtained by taking advantage\n\u00012\nof the normalization \u03bbn ( ) = \u00b11( ) to factorize (34) into a product of N\nexponentials, i.e.,\nGP ( ) =\n\nN\nK\nn=1\n\nN\n\u0001 K\n\u0001\nEXP \u03c0n \u03bbn ( ) =\nexp \u03c0n \u03bbn ( ) .\n\n(36)\n\nn=1\n\nHowever, this \"brute-force\" method has the disadvantage that the corresponding\nfinite transformations's parameters \u03c0n have generally no clear physical or geometrical interpretation. This is why the product form is mostly used in application\nwhere the intrinsic meaning of the parameters is not essential, as was the case in\nthe first published parametrizations [2, 3, 4, 6].\nBasis elements (or exponential) form: An alternative to the canonical form,\nwhich is possible for matrices as well as for quaternions, is to expand the elements\nof the group into a sum over the basis elements 1( ) and \u03bbn ( ),\n\u03c0 )( ) + i\nGB ( ) = u0 (\u03c0\n\nN\nX\n\n\u03c0 )\u03bbn ( ) .\nun (\u03c0\n\n(37)\n\nn=1\n\nFor SU(2) the coefficients are simply u0 = cos( 21 \u03b1) and un = sin( 12 \u03b1)an . But\nfor SU(3) the coefficients can only be calculated after a cubic equation has been\nsolved for every group element [5].\nHamilton-Cayley form: In applications such as the quark model or strong\ninteractions, where the so-called SU(3) \"octet-vector\" \u03c0 has a direct interpretation\n12\n\n\f[20], it is useful to expand the elements of the group into a power series in \u03c0 * \u03bb ( ) .\nBecause of the Hamilton-Cayley theorem this series has three terms for SU(3),\n\u0001\n\u00012\n\u03c0 )( ) + C2 (\u03c0\n\u03c0 ) \u03c0 * \u03bb ( ) + C3 (\u03c0\n\u03c0 ) \u03c0 * \u03bb( ) ,\nGH ( ) = C1 (\u03c0\n(38)\nso that only three coefficients have to be calculated instead of nine as in the\nexponential form. These coefficients were found to be rather complicated at\nfirst [7], but it was later established that they could be expressed in terms of\nSU(3) invariants [8]. More recently, somewhat simpler formulas were obtained by\nexpressing the SU(3) group elements in terms of two orthonormal vectors instead\nof just the octet-vector [10, 11], and further progress is likely [12]. Interestingly, if\nthe octet-vector is expressed in terms of the quaternion linear functions that appear\nin the exponent of the canonical representation (23),\n\u0001\n\u03c0 * \u03bb( ) = i\u03b2 12~b[ ]~b + \u03b1 12 ~a[ ] \u2212 [ ]~a + iD{\u03b41 ,\u03b42 ,\u03b43 ,\u03b2,~b} ( ) ,\n(39)\n\nit is possible to get a quaternion equivalent of (38). However, the physical interpretation will not be the same as with the Gell-Mann octet-vector because the\nparameters (i.e., ~a, ~b, \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b4n ; see Table 1) will not relate to the quark model,\nor to the gluon creation/destruction operators of quantum chromodynamics, in the\nusual way. But this may precisely be the main interest of the quaternion approach:\nan opportunity for new interpretations.\n\"Euler-angles\" representations\nIn Euler-angles representations only a subset {\u03bbl(n) } \u2282 {\u03bbn } of the Lie generators is used to formulate the general element of the group:\nGE ( ) = EXP\n\nm1\nX\nn=1\n\nN\nX\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03c0n \u03bbl(n) ( ) \u2299 ... \u2299 EXP\n\u03c0n \u03bbl(n) ( ) .\n\n(40)\n\nn=mk\n\nFor instance, in the case of SU(n), the minimal number of generators needed\nto generated the whole set is 2(n \u2212 1), i.e., two for SU(2) as in (29 \u2212 30\u2032).\nSince that number is four for SU(3), many early parametrizations used just four\ngenerators [4, 6]. In this respect, our own Euler-angles representation (31) is\nnot minimal since it uses five different generators. But this number could easily\nbe reduced to four if the two SO(3) factors were replaced by their Euler-angles\ncounterparts. However, doing so would lead to a more complicated representation\nthat would spoil the main advantage of (31), namely to show that in line with the\nusual interpretation of Euler-angles in ordinary three-space rotations, a general\nfinite SU(3) \"rotation\" in complex three-space is obtained by making first a three\ndimensional rotation around an axis ~b, then a diagonal rotation, and finally a second\nthree dimensional rotation around an axis ~a.\n13\n\n\fSpecific advantages of quaternion representations\nAs we have just seen with the Euler-angles formulation of SU(3), quaternion\nrepresentations have a number of didactical advantages. For example, the use\nof quaternions forces a \"natural\" grouping of parameters into scalars and vectors\nwhich may have a geometrical or a physical interpretation, and which may lead to\nvarious formal or algebraic simplifications.\nIn this perspective, the grouping of the symmetrical, antisymmetrical, and\ndiagonal matrix elements into separate linear quaternion function may lead to\nfurther geometrical insight into the geometry of SU(3) transformations. For\ninstance, with regards to the representation (25), the arguments of the second and\nthird exponentials correspond to the so-called \"q-\" and \"r-\" octet-vectors of Michel\nand Radicati [20]. What is then the geometric meaning of the argument of the first\nexponential?\nConcerning the applications of the quaternion representations given in this\npaper, possibly the most obvious ones are in the field of particle and nuclear\nphysics, as already mentioned in the introduction. However, further applications in\nmathematics and physics may stem from the general need for spherical harmonics\nand their generalization to the \"complex rotations\" corresponding to SU(3) and\nSU(4), e.g., [4]. In this respect, since many practical calculations with ordinary\nspherical harmonics are linked to Euler-angles representations of the rotation\ngroup, e.g., [19], the representations (31 \u2212 33) can be of great help to generalize\nknown SU(2) results to SU(3) and SU(4).\nFinally, compared to matrices, a general advantage of quaternion representations or formulations is that they are coordinate-free. For instance, in matrix\nrepresentations, finding subgroups consists of isolating \"blocks\" or particular\ncombinations of lines and rows, and then possibly of making a change of basis\nto get the general case. On the other hand, in quaternion representations such as\n(31 \u2212 33), it is possible to \"continuously\" specialize/generalize between groups\nand subgroups, and thus to obtain, if not all, at least a large fraction of all related\ngroups and subgroups, directly in their most general form.\n\n7\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nIt is a pleasure to thank Dr. Jean-Pierre Hurni for stimulating discussions and\nmathematical guidance through the intricacies of the theory of Lie groups.\n\n14\n\n\fReferences\n[1] R.
