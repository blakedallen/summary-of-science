Introduction\nRATAN-600 [1], is the world biggest in size reflector, with resolution by two orders of\nmagnitudes higher, than it is necessary just to resolve the CMB anisotropy. As any reflector, it\nhas much higher brightness temperature sensitivity than any radio telescope with unfilled\naperture. Excess resolution helps greatly in the filtration of the atmosphere noise [2],[3] and in\nthe cleaning data from the point sources (PS). The most popular \"Transit\" mode of observation\nin the local meridian gives the unusual ability of multi-frequency observations at many\nwavelengths. Moreover, the aplanat solution with practically zero aberrations [4] may be\nrealized near local zenith, and from hundreds to several thousands receivers array may be\ninstalled along the focal line of the secondary (parabolic cylinder) mirror.\nHere we present the list of innovations of the RATAN-600 facilities, data accumulation process\nat the present state, results obtained up to now and activity connected with the next generation\nPLANCK mission related experiments at RATAN-600 [30].\nII.RATAN-600 upgrading\na.\nPanels resurfacing and optimization of the panels shape. To improve the efficiency at the\nhighest frequency, close to PLANCK LFI, we resurfaced all 900 (7.5m x 2m in size ) elements\nof the RING part of the RATAN-600 and all 80 (8.3m x 3m in size) FLAT mirror elements. Now\nthe panels have r.m.s. errors about 0.2mm., by factor 5 better, than it was before.\nb.\nPanels mean curvature was change to be optimized to the small zenith angle field, where\ntwo sources of systematic errors disappear (wrong curvature effects and wrong orientation\neffects, see [1].\nc.\nPanels adjustment process now under the full computer control and readjustment errors\nnow are below the new surface accuracy.\nd.\nTwo suppress the spillover effect, special screens (1.5m above and 1.5m below the main\npanel surface) were installed. It also increased the geometrical surface of the RING at the low\nfrequency part of the RATAN-600 band by 5400 sq.m. and the lowest frequency of the\nRATAN-600 now moved to 300 GHz (Fresnel zone limitation).\n1\n\n\f2\ne.\nMain decemetrics frequencies (0.6GHz, 1GHz, 2.4GHz with 8 sub-channels each) were\nintegrated in the non-standard single phase center feed system (ref), which simplifies the\ninterpretation of the Galactic backgrounds.\nf.\nSeveral innovations were tested to suppress the quickly increasing level of the man-made\ninterference and some of them are in the regular use. Atmosphere interference was studied\ndeeply [2], and limitation on the CMB anisotropy experiments was found in I, U, Q Stokes\nparameters. Most of the data may be used for high l scales (l>200-500) .\ng.\nMulti-frequency receiver array was improved greatly: new 0.6GHz receiver was added\nand better crio radiometers appeared at high frequencies, and all broad band decemetrics\nreceivers were subdivided by 8 channels. It increased the frequency channels number in 0.6GHz21GHz range from 7 to 28. (see http://www.sao.ru)\nh.\nNew experimental matrix HEMT MMIC receivers array at the PLANCK LFI\nfrequency, 30GHz was installed a (first version, with 6 horns), and new version is now in\nprogress, with 32 horns. [5], [6].\ni.\nNew two-channels 5GHz receiver was added recently, which is the most sensitive now,\nand it will be used efficiently for the separation of the point sources from other backgrounds, as\nwell as for many calibration purposes [7].\nFew important software improvement and the simplification of the data access process may be\nmentioned as well: quick \"stream\" data reduction algorithms appeared and optical fiber\nconnection of RATAN-600 backend with the main Observatory DATA BANK and INTERNET\nnow available. Much better understanding of the beam shape we have now, and improved theory\nwas checked by observations accurately [8]. Very distant scattering, down to -70db was\nestimated now at all frequencies, and the level of this scattering is much below the PLANCK\none. Muller matrix was calculated with real aberration effects, and it was shown that antenna\ninstrumental polarization in U,Q Stokes parameters is below 1% for l<10000 CMB\nexperiments [5].\n\nIII. DATA accumulation process.\nAbout 1/3 of the telescope time last several years was spend on the PLANCK- related\nexperiments . Before 2000 we had several CMB experiments (see [11] and references there),\nincluding COLD experiment concentrated on the DEC=5 deg., 0h<RA<24h 1 degree wide strip\nsurvey. Later we added DEC=88 deg. 0h<RA<24h strip and now the main region is connected\nwith local zenith strip survey, DEC=41deg 20min 0h<RA<24h and 10 adjacent DEC strips,\nseparated by 12.5 arcmin.\nIt was realized, that not only the CMB DEDICATED projects data, but also all data\naccumulated in long-time monitoring programs (50% of the telescope time) should be used for\nsmall scale anisotropy experiments. In the most popular TRANSIT multifrequency mode of\nobservations, all observers need to observe the field comparable with the scale of the\ncosmological horizon at the recombination epoch. About 1000 objects were observed more the\n100 times, and high pixel sensitivity was accumulated in about 1000 sq. deg. total area. This\napproach reminds the 2dF one in optical domain, and we call this type of our data flow as \"2dF\nRadio\". All observations are in the multi-frequency mode, with white noise sensitivity about few\nmK (1 sec. integration) at high frequencies (4GHz-30GHz ) and about 10mK-20mK (1 sec.\nintegration) at low frequencies (0.6GHz-2.4GHz). The HPBW at 30GHz is 0.1arcmin x\n0.6arcmin in the ZENITH field, with non-zero extension up to 6arcmin in DEC. This beam is\nscaled with frequency in the standard way. Details of the RATAN-600 facilities may be found at\nthe RATAN-600 site, http://www.sao.ru [9], [10].\nAbout 100 of 24-houres scans collected at DEC=88 deg, 300-at DEC=+5 deg, 300 in ZENITH\nfield and more than 100 scans per each of the about 1000 2dF fields. Some part of the data are\nfrom single beam experiments, some from beam switching, and at 7.7GHz and 30GHz there is\n2\n\n\f3\nbig collection of the U, Q data. Total data accumulation process at all high frequencies (4GHz,\n7.7GHz, 11GHz, 21GHz, 30HGz) is visible on the Fig.1\n\nFig.1. Total Telescope time, accumulated at RATAN-600 at 5 \"Galaxy Window\" frequencies in\nthree types of programs: DEC=5 (Cold) field, ZENITH field , POLE field and \"2dF Radio\"\n(monitoring programs).\nThe main target- to accumulate pixel S/N ratio close to the CMB anisotropy level (or to the\nlevel of the secondary anisotropy effects). As far as the white noise receiver components, we are\nnow close to the level, suggested by theory, and we recently changed the strategy, and began to\nextend the size of the ZENITH field, to avoid the \"COSMIC VARIANCE\" limitation. We hope\nto accumulate data as long as we need, may be, up to the PLANCK mission time (Feb.2007).\nWe have to compensate lower receivers NET sensitivity than WMAP, South Pole and\nPLANCK one by much longer integration time per pixel.\n\nIV. Some results.\na.\nBetter understanding of the \"Galaxy Window\" to the CMB now available. Instead of\nHASLAM 408 MHz synchrotron template (too low frequency, too low resolution, 1K\ntemperature resolution only) we spent few years to improve data on the CMB interesting l and\nfrequencies, closer to PLANCK LFI than 408MHz HASLAM map case.\nWe realized, that the GALAXY window is much wider, than suggested by Early predictions\nat least for PESSIMISTIC and close to OPTIMISTIC case ([12]). Our new data [13], [14] are\nshown at the Fig.2.\n\n3\n\n\f4\n\nFig2. Comparison of the old SREENS predictions for synchrotron, free-free noise at l=2000 with\nnew RATAN-600 data at cm. waves. PESSIMISTIC, MIDDLE and OPTIMISTIC variants are\nshown from [12 ]. It is visible, that real noise is closer to the \"optimistic\" one.\nb.\nTwo years we spent two years to check the Princeton group prediction of the noise from\nspinning dust [15] . We have frequencies, where this noise is the most intense, and found only\nthe upper level of the spinning dust noise by order of magnitudes below predicted at CMB\ninteresting scales (c.f. PESSIMISTIC case in [12]), as visible from Fig.3.\n\nFig.3. Comparison of the original \"Spinning dust\" theory [12, ] with RATAN-600 dedicated\nobservations at predicted frequency, 21 GHz [17]. Our upper limit is by order of magnitude\nbelow predictions.\n\n4\n\n\f5\nc.\nThere were many estimates of the level synchrotron polarized noise from the Galaxy.\nAgain, most suggestions were done using much lower frequencies, less resolution, and less\nsensitive than it is necessary to predict accurately enough the l=1000 noise at PLANCK\nfrequencies. We collected about 1 year data at high Galactic latitudes at 7.7GHz and realized,\nthat simple extrapolation in frequency, scales and latitudes [12], [21] does not fit our data- the\nreal polarized noise is much less, and several explanations were given [13], [17].\nd.\n\nPoint sources (PS) problem for PLANCK.\nAbout five years ago, at the beginning of the PLANCK project activity, there was\ndiscussion about the possible NEW PS POPULATION, connected with INVERTED, or even\nmm GPS objects, DUSTY objects invisible in Radio Catalogs, and about strong SZ noise at\nvery high l. Efficiency of the cleaning of the CMB experiments by RATAN-600 PS data was\ndemonstrated in [29]\nIn January, 2004, we compiled the list of PS, detected in our deep zenith survey with at 4GHz\nwith limiting flux density about 1mJy [18].\n\na)\n\nb)\nFig.4. Deep strip scan result at 4GHz at DEC=41 grad. 20 min with selection of all details\nstronger than 2-sigma noise level [18]. These details (4452 in about 15 sq.deg. area) were\nseparated from the scan before CMB and background anisotropy estimates were made. a)- all\ndetails in the 0h<RA<24h, DEC=41 grad. 20arcin +/-1.5 arcmin strip area; b)- small part of the\nscan between 9.4h<RA<9.6h are shown.\n\n5\n\n\f6\nThe surface density of these sources happened to be close to that of the best decemetrics NVSS\nand FIRST catalogs and much greater that in any cm. waves catalogs, based on the observations\nof sky area greater than 1 square degree, see Fig.5 below, were only strong (more than 5-sigma\nnoise level objects were counted.\n\nFig.5. RATAN-600 Zenith Field (RZF) strong source population surface density per square\ndegree compared with that for the best cm-waves catalogs compiled from the sky area greater\nthan 1 sq. deg. list (see CATS, http://cats.sao.ru, e.g.)\nPractically all listed objects were never observed in cm. band, 70% may be identified with\nNVSS objects, about 30% are new radio sky objects.\n\nFig.6. Simple 2-frequencies spectral indexes histogram of NVSS objects, found in our\nZENITH strip survey. Median \u03b1=-0.85, with few USS and inverted spectra objects.\n\n6\n\n\f7\n. From dm-cm spectral indexes (see Fig.6) we have tried to estimate, how many NVSS objects\nmay appear in PLANCK maps (say, above 300 mJy at 30GHz ) and realized, that this number is\nsmall. All new objects are weak, with median flux density at 4GHz about 2mJy, and even in the\nextreme cases of inverted , GPS, Black body spectrum this new population can't be dominant\none at PLANCK LFI frequencies. First data reduction of 11GHz data in the same zenith strip\nsurvey confirms this conclusion. We suggest, that most objects of the PLANCK LFI Sky will be\nNVSS objects, with some mixture with IRAS objects.\nImmediately after publication of 208 WMAP objects, with 8 new sky objects, we compiled\nthe spectra of all identified objects and reobserved some of them 19] . We do not confirm the\nreality of NEW sky objects . At the same time, it was demonstrated, that real nature of objects\nmay be better understood if spectra compilation will be based on the observations made as close\nin time to the PLANCK observations, as possible. In cooperation with Finland PLANCK group,\nwe are preparing now to the \"Quick Reaction\" mode of observations, were all 8 broad band\nRATAN-600 (with about 40 sub-channels) may be used for compilation of spectrum in the\nINTERDAY time scale. The first experience with WMAP PS list suggests, that no less\ninformative may be just coordination of the global monitoring programs, conducted now by\nseveral groups with different scientific accents, with PLANCK. With predicted BEAM\nSCANNING process, it is easy to prepare the \"time table\" for the moments, when PLANCK\nbeams cross the most interesting sky objects. PLANCK + HERSHEL common field may be\nincluded in this list as well.\ne. Jupiter as a PLANCK calibrator.\nWe were asked by TAC PLANCK group to check the stability of Jupiter radiation at\n30GHz, and how accurately it may be used as a calibrator during PLANCK mission. About\nhundred 6 arcsec resolution in R.A. and with S/N =1000 scans at 30GHz demonstrated, that the\nmean disk temperature is stable enough, (at \u201330db level). Belt emission also was barely\ndetected, at the level about or less than 1%, but this emission is also stable enough (at <10%\nlevel) [20]\n\nV. RATAN-600 next generation experiments.\nSome directions of pre-PLANCK activity in the next 4 Years are well formulated\nare in progress.\n\nand\n\na.\nFirst of all it is an escalation of the rate of data accumulation by increasing of number of\nreceivers used. Main road- 30GHz matrix array. 6 horns array now in real observations, and 32\nhorns in the construction, we hope test it in the next winter.\n256 horns matrix is waiting for the financial support, but special big secondary mirror\nwith 4.8m focal line is ready. New much better rail tracks were constructed recently which can\nguide this new 150 ton (7.4m x 11.5m ) parabolic cylinder. Instead of standard speed (square\nroot of the telescope time, T), the square root of the product T x N(t) is now the main\nparameter, and 32 horns array supply result of 1 month averaging of single horn observations in\none day.\nWe expect the rate of the data accumulation close to that, shown in fig.7. With single cannel\nin the transit mode of observations the pixel sensitivity in one scan only is about 0.4 mK for\nl=2000 scale. Accumulation of the 1000 scans (1000 days x number of channels) gives much\nbetter sensitivity.\n\n7\n\n\f8\n\nFig.7. Pixel sensitivity accumulation process at l=2000 scale. Open circles- one channel\nsensitivity, filled circles- sum of all channels in the \"Galaxy Window\" band (f>4GHz). S/N=1\nlevels are shown for T and E CMB anisotropy modes (horizontal lines); l=200 level is shown as\nwell.\nb.\n\nHigh l polarization.\nWith 30GHz matrix we begin to search small scale sky polarization, and in the limited (say,\n100 sq. deg. ) field to be close (or better) than PLANCK mission suggests, and some information\nwe expect to have up to l=5000. With S/N>1 in the small region the \"Cosmic Variance\" noise\nwill dominate, and with no resolution limitation we can expect the result shown in Fig.8.\n\nFig.8. Expected \"Cosmic Variance\" noise in E-mode of CMB polarization after accumulation of\nthe data in the ZENITH Field at 30GHz up to S/N <1, [31]. Old [12] and RATAN-600 new\nestimates [17,18 ] of the Galaxy Synchrotron noise at high l are shown by horizontal bars.\nc.\n\nSZ Cosmology\n8\n\n\f9\nSimple Thermal SZ effect (first observed in 1970, Pulkovo, with RATAN-600 type 130m-Radio\nTelescope, [22]) should dominate in the sky noise at l>3000. The present day pre-PLANCK\nactivity in this field connected with mapping of known X-Ray clusters. But the X-Ray emission\nquickly escapes from the detection at z>1-2, whereas the effect itself does not depend on the\nredshift, and may exist as early as z=5-30. That is why the \"blind SZ survey\" is sharply needed.\nWe suggest RATAN-600 as a tool for such observations. Flat mirror inside the circle in\ncombination with southern sector (see www) may be used as blind survey instrument in simple\ntransit mode with big daily field of view. With new generation cooled array with sub-mK NET,\nwe can detect hundreds SZ spots in the single day. The result of simulation of such experiments\nwith present day logN-logS data is shown at Fig.9 [5].\n\nFig.9. Transit curve of standard distant X-Ray cluster at RATAN-600 using with FLAT mirror\nmode (frequency 30GHz, 6 arcsec x 6 arcmin resolution, 0.5 seconds integration time).\nPLANCK LFI type receivers array along the focal line of the secondary parabolic cylinder\nmirror were used in simulation. Point sources may be easy separated due to high resolution.\nThey can be studied accurately with dedicated SZ instruments. Few arcsec (onedimensional) resolution results in good position and angular size measurements, and RJ specific\n(\"Black body with negative temperature\" spectrum may be confirmed at RATAN-600 or\nelsewhere. \"Sign, Size, Spectrum\" method in RJ band leaves no room for other interpretation.\nAfter simple detection much greater S/N data should be collected, and for this purpose we are\npreparing to the few hours integration mode, using special rail track inserted between FLAT\nmirror and SOUTHERN sector. This track was fully reconstructed recently to meet accuracy\nspecified by 30GHz frequency. There is also some very distant variant to transform the simple\ntotal power receivers array into the \"phased focal array\". In this case it is possible to correct\naberrations of all kinds, increase greatly the daily field of view and convert single aperture mode\nof observations into the \"multi-sub-aperture\" system, with sub-aperture size as small as size of\ntelescope panel, [23]-[25], [32].\nCMB Spectroscopy belong to the most difficult but very interesting field of cosmology, where\nonly few theoretical publications available [27] and practically no experiments ( except some\npreliminary test by Gosachinskij group. Reflector geometry is the only one which may be used\nin \"blind\" searches of spectral sky features at unknown redshift (say, 5<Z<50; 700<Z<3000). HI,\nH2O, CO, primordial moleculas, recombination lines from recombination and secondary\nionization epoch- among the candidates. Computer control of the telescope panels positions\ngives also unusual possibility of Michelson Fourier interferometry, but it was never tested at\nRATAN-600 [23]). RATAN-600 High resolution we use in the test CMB spectroscopy\nobservations to find any \"Frequency-Space structure\" and first results were published recently.\n\n9\n\n\f10\nWe are very interested in cooperation; it makes our long distant plans more reliable.\n\nAcknowledgements\nA large number of staff members of Special Astrophysical Institute and several others\ninstitutes took part in the PLANCK ground based support activity with the help of RATAN600.
