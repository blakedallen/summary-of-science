It consists of a content and the\nawareness of such content.\nConsciousness is a system which observes itself. It evaluates itself being aware at the same time of\ndoing so.\nLet x, y, z be statements describing contents of various experiences. They are (atomic) content\nstatements. Starting from such statements, other content statements may be formed by Boolean\nfunctions. z = f(x, y,.....) are methalinguistic propositions that are not content statements or\nexperience-describing statements themselves. Awareness statements a, b, c, ..., self-referential or\nautoreferential, require autoreferential definitions as\nai = Fi (a1 ,....., a n ; x1 , x 2 ,......, x n ) , (i = 1,2,...., n) where Fi are Boolean functions. As example\na = F (a, x) is the most simple definition of a single autoreferential statement a [1].\nx = the snow is white ; a = I am aware of this . We have here a logical self-reference\nmathematical model of conscious experience.\nConsciousness represents the hard problem for excellence in our scientific, epistemological and\nphilosophical knowledge [2].\nIf one day we would arrive identifying at all or in part the basic physical, scientific, philosophical\nprinciples or rules that act in our reality in order to determine consciousness and mind in humans,\nwe would have moved in the way of a new great advance in our knowledge. This paper moves in\nsuch direction and perspective.\nThe present physical theory has not a definite apparatus to describe conscious systems . However,\nwe cannot exclude that future generalizations of the present physical knowledge will be able to\napproach such basic problem. An indication arises from quantum mechanics. Quantum theory\nrepresents the most confirmed and celebrated theory of science. Started in 1927 by founder fathers\nas Bohr, Heisenberg, Schr\u00f6dinger, and Pauli [3], it has revolutionized our understanding of the\n\n\fphysical reality in both scientific and epistemological fields. It was introduced to describe the\nbehaviour of atomic systems but subsequently its range of validity has turned out to be much wider\nincluding in particular some macroscopic phenomena like superconductivity or superfluidity. There\nis a salient and crucial feature for this theory. The conceptual structure and the axiomatic\nfoundations of quantum theory repeatedly suggested from its advent and in the further eighty years\nof its elaboration that it has a profound link with mental entities and their dynamics. From its advent\nsuch theory was strongly debated but often also criticized just for its attitude to prospect a model\nof reality that results strongly linked to mental entities and their dynamics. In any manner standard\nformulation of quantum mechanics seemed to fix from its beginning the necessity to admit the\nunequivocal presence and role of mental properties to represent properties of the physical objects.\nThis statement is true. We retain that it represents an important feature of the theory instead of its\nlimit. However, there is the problem to correctly interpret such connection between quantum\nmechanics and mental properties in the sphere of our reality. It must be clear that one cannot have\nin mind a quantum physical reduction of mental processes. N. Bohr [4] borrowed the principle of\ncomplementarity, that is at the basis of quantum mechanics, from psychology. He was profoundly\ninfluenced from reading the \"Principles of Psychology \" by W. James [4]. However, N. Bohr never\nhad in mind quantum-reductionism of mind entities. Starting with 1930, there was also an important\ncorrespondence between W. Pauli and C.G. Jung [5]. It culminated in the formulation of a theory\ncalled of mind-matter synchronization. Also in this case these founding fathers as Pauli and Jung\nwere very distant to consider a quantum-reductionist perspective. V. Orlov [6] proposed to use\nquantum logic to describe functioning of brain, but also he did not look for reduction of mental\nprocesses to quantum physics. The correct way to frame the problem is not to attempt a quantum\nreduction of mental processes, the most profitable applications of quantum mechanics in cognitive\nsciences and psychology can be obtained not by any attempt of quantum physical reduction but\ngiving experimental evidence that cognitive systems are very complex information systems, to\nwhich also some laws of quantum systems can be applied. Just the reaching of such objective would\nrepresent a very great advance in the domain of knowledge. In fact, starting with such experimental\nevidence, we could elaborate some future developments knowing this time the principles to use, the\nformal criteria to follow in order to approach with higher rigour the framing of the nature of mental\nentities and of their dynamics.\nWe retain that in this perspective we give here a first contribution since we give her for the first\ntime experimental confirmation that mental states, at some stages of human perception and\ncognition, follow quantum mechanics. Thus for the first time, also if not under a reductionism\nperspective, we have the change to understand what are the principles and rules acting as counter\npart of human mind.\n2. The Theoretical Basis of the Experiment.\nTo fully agree with the present paper, the reader must take care the following crucial point:\nquantum mechanics has its unique law of transformation of probability distribution. It is well\nknown that the main feature of quantum probabilistic behaviour is the well known phenomenon of\ninterference of probabilities. Such interference regime may be obtained only in quantum systems,\ne. g., in the celebrated two slit experiment that has been confirmed at any level of experimental\ninvestigation [7]. The interference gives the experimental basis of the superposition principle and\nthis latter is the basis foundation of the physical and philosophical system of view that we call\nquantum mechanics. This is the essential peculiarity that we aim to investigate in the present paper.\nRecently, the problem of quantum probabilities was extended in the so called calculus of contextual\nprobabilities [see in detail 8] .The essential feature of this elaboration is that by it we may be able to\nascertain the presence of quantum like behaviour also in systems that exhibit context quantum like\nbehaviour as physical, cognitive, social systems. We will not enter in the detail of the method here\nfor brevity but all the features are given in the quoted literature [8]. The essence of the method is\nbased on the following step. Let A and B be two dichotomic questions which can be asked to people\n\n\fS with possible answers \"yes (+) or not (-). In our case we consider A and B two mental quantum\nlike observables of people S under investigation. We split the given ensemble S of humans in two\nsub ensembles U and V of equal numbers . To ensemble U we pose the question A with probability\nin answering, given respectively by p( A = +) and p( A = \u2212) , and p( A = +) + p( A = \u2212) = 1 .We\npose the question B immediately followed by the question A to the ensemble V. We will calculate\nconditional probabilities p( A = + / B = +) and p ( A = + / B = \u2212) and equivalent probabilities for the\ncase ( A = \u2212) . Now we have reached a no eludible feature of such experiment. In such kind of\ntransformation, by using the numerical results of the experimentation [8], we calculate\ncos \u03b8 =\n=\n\np ( A = + ) \u2212 p ( B = + ) p ( A = + / B = + ) \u2212 p ( B = \u2212) p ( A = + / B = \u2212)\n2 p ( B = + ) p ( A = + / B = + ) p ( B = \u2212) p ( A = + / B = \u2212)\n\u2206p\n\n=\n(2.1)\n\n2 p ( B = + ) p ( A = + / B = + ) p ( B = \u2212) p ( A = + / B = \u2212)\nIf it results cos \u03b8 \u2260 0 it will be certain that we are in presence of quantum like behaviour for mental\nstates owing to the presence of interference terms for the calculated probabilities. In the case\ncos \u03b8 = 0 we will conclude that quantum mechanics is absent in the dynamic regime of our mental\nstates. \u03b8 is obviously a well known angle of phase. In conclusion our experiment does not admit\nexceptions. By using the (2.1) it gives direct answer to the central problem to identify if quantum\nmechanics is involved or not in the regimes of mental states in humans. If we obtain cos \u03b8 \u2260 0 , the\nanswer is positive while instead is negative if it results cos \u03b8 = 0 .\nWe may proceed giving a quantum like framework of mental states. Let us remember that,\naccording to Born's probability rule [3, 8] , we have\n2\nP( A = \u00b1) = \u03c6 (\u00b1)\n(2.2)\n\nIn the case in which the experiment confirms quantum mechanics in dynamics of mental states, as\nusually in standard theory, we can write a quantum-like wave function \u03c6 S (\u00b1 ) relative to the mental\nstate S of the population investigated, and it will be represented by the complex amplitude as for the\nfirst time elaborated in [8] and applied in our previous papers.\n\u03c6 S ( x) = [P( B = + ) P( A = x / B = + )]1 / 2 + e i\u03b8 ( x ) [P( B = \u2212) P( A = x / B = \u2212]1 / 2 with x = \u00b1 (2.3)\nIt is only necessary to outline the importance of future studies on cognition based possibly on the\n(2.3).\n3. The Arrangement of the Experiment\nOur experiment was based on the search of quantum behaviour in mental states during human\nperception and cognition of ambiguous figures.\nOn a general plane, it is known that brain organizes the sensory input into some representation of\nthe given environment. Studies of perception indicate that the mental representation of a visual\nperceived object at any instant is unique also if we may be aware of the possible ambiguity of any\ngiven representation. The case is the Necker cube published by this author in 1832 [9] where we\nsee the cube in one of two ways but only one of such representations is apparent at any time. We\nmay be able to see the ambiguity of the design and even we may be able to switch wilfully between\nrepresentations: we can be aware that multiple representations are possible but we can perceive\nthem only one at time, that is seriatim.\nBistable perception arises whenever a stimulus can be thought in two different alternatives ways. In\nprevious papers [8] we proposed to describe bistable perception with the formalism of a two\nquantum system. In our quantum like model of mental states we admit that an individual can\npotentially have multiple representations of a given choice situation, but can attend to only one\nrepresentation at any given time. In this quantum mechanical framework we distinguish a potential\nand an actual or manifest state of consciousness. The state of the potential consciousness will be\n\n\frepresented by a vector in Hilbert space. If we indicate as example a bi dimensional case with\npotential states / 1 > and / 2 > , the potential state of consciousness will be given by\n\u03c8 = a / 1 > +b / 2 > .\n(3.1)\n2\n\nHere, a and b represent probability amplitudes so that a will give the probability that the state of\nconsciousness, represented by percept / 1 > , will be finally actualised or manifested during\n2\n\nperception . Instead b will represent the probability that state(percept) / 2 > of consciousness will\nbe actualised or manifested during perception. It will be a + b = 1 .\n2\n\n2\n\n4. The Experiment Set Up.\nGenerally speaking, the problem is to explain how, given multiple possibilities of representation, a\nparticular representation can take place over our attention. In the case of Necker cube transitions\nbetween percepts may be possibly stochastic but in more complex mental and psychological\nsituations some underlying factors may give the edge to one representation over another. Recent or\nrepeated prior use of a representation may play role in advantaging one representation on the other.\nThis is the reason to project the experiment carefully. Otherwise the study of ambiguous figures has\nintrigued and still is of valuable interest for psychologists and neuroscientists. A variety of theories\nhas been published [10]. For the purposes of our experimentation we evaluated that two types of\nobservers have been acknowledged by the experiments, fast observers having larger frequency of\nperspective reversals and slow observers whose frequency is lower. The persistent times staying one\nof the two percepts are usually in mean on the order of two seconds but may arrive also to about\nfive seconds. To further confirm our quantum model with potential and actual states of\nconsciousness, we have a further phenomenological datum. Subjects evidence uncertain time in\nstates percepts in addition to perspective reversal. Uncertain times about 1 sec were experimentally\nascertained in mean for speed subjects [11]. In conclusion, two kinds of times are identified during\nexperiments with ambiguous figures: a time persisting one of the two possible percepts that we may\ncall time persisting percept A, but it is similar to time persisting the percept B. Still we have a time\nof uncertain and neither one of the percepts nor another is certain for the subject, and this is in\nagreement with the previous quantum model on potential state of consciousness. Experiments have\nconfirmed that the distribution of the persistent time in uncertain states is quite different from those\ncorresponding to percepts A and B that result instead of the same behaviour and order. There are\nstill two basic different approaches in studies of perception of ambiguous stimuli. One is the\nbehavioural response to a stimulus based on psychological or mental processes. There are still two\nbasic different approaches in studies of perception of ambiguous stimuli. One is the behavioural\nresponse to a stimulus based on psychological or mental processes. This is obtained using the\nfrequency of reversals. The second approach looks instead to neural correlates of psychological\nprocesses triggered by stimuli.\n\nWe analyzed EEG recorded from parietal and frontal areas, focusing on gamma band phase\nsynchronization between these two areas. A recent neuroimaging study using functional magnetic\nresonance imaging (fMRI) has suggested that conscious detection of visual changes relies on both\nparietal and frontal areas [12]. The same areas also show activation in perceptual switching\nexperiments [12]. These areas, therefore, seem to play an important role in detecting changes in our\nperception, whether they are caused externally or internally [12]. The temporal characteristics of the\nrelationship between these two areas are not well understood. However, it has been proposed that\ntransient synchronization of oscillatory activity, in particular in the gamma band of the EEG, plays\nan important role in building coalitions between areas [12]. Moreover transient gamma band\nsynchronization induced by sensory stimulation is considered important for perceptual feature\nbinding of distributed representations [12]. For this reason, transient gamma band synchronization\nis important in our investigation. The time scale of 3 sec results from a state of being conscious and\n\n\fthat this time scale is also significant for cognitive processes beyond the bistable perception of\nambiguous stimuli. Experiments have been performed [12] concerning capabilities of\ndiscriminating and sequencing temporally separate perceptual events. Also for \u2206t \u03c6 30ms , two\ndifferent individual events are clearly separable and their sequence can be correctly assigned. In\nconclusion these are the two cognitive time scales that one should take in consideration in\nexperimentation on perception and cognition of ambiguous figures.\nOur experiment was planed on an accurate consideration of the data previously obtained in\nliterature. Its architecture was based on the analysis of the (2.1) with given ambiguous figures A and\nB.\nStarting with 2003 we performed our previous three experiments [8] of this kind and they were\nbased on ninety eights subjects. In the present experimentation we investigated a group of other\ntwenty six subjects. In substance, this last experimentation concludes our cycles of verification on\nthis team after two years of investigation and one hundred and twenty four subjects examined. It\nmust be clear that for The last twenty six subjects that we engaged in such final experimentation,\nwe used more restrictive conditions of experimentation in the sense that we used different tests of\nambiguous percepts, and we made any effort to use ambiguous figures giving to the subject an\nimmediate effect of visual ambiguity followed soon after by a direct and unique perception of the\nsubject. The high speed in inducing ambiguity followed from a rapid selection of percept gives the\nbest experimental conditions to examine our quantum model of consciousness. In this sense we\nretain, therefore, that the results of the present investigation must be considered more definitive\nrespect to the other results that we performed previously. In fact ,only to repeat we remember that,\naccording to our quantum model as previously given in (2.1), we admit that an individual can\npotentially have multiple representations of a given choice situation, but he can attend to only one\nrepresentation at any given time. Strong and immediate ambiguity as induced in the present case by\ntest A and B, would consequently induce the subject to suspend his potential consciousness state\nsoon after followed from actualised or manifest state of his consciousness. In conclusion, by this\nlast phase of experimentation, we retain to have performed any effort to guarantee the best final\nconditions in verifying if quantum mechanics enters in the dynamics of mental states during\nperception of ambiguous figures. All the subjects were selected with about equal distribution of\nfemales and males, aged between 19 and 22 years. All had normal or corrected-to-normal vision.\nAll they were divided by random selection in two groups (1) and (2) of thirteen subjects. The\ngroup (1) was subjected to test A (Fig.A) while the group (2) was subjected to Test B and soon after\n(about 800 msec after choice for test B) to test A. In all the cases the posed question to the subject\nwas to answer what animal he was thinking after certain identification of ambiguity when he had in\nvision the figure. It has been shown that perception and cognition in ambiguous figures is\ninfluenced by visual angle [13]. Therefore a constant visual angle V = 2arctg ( S / 2 D) = 0.33 rad .\nwas used by us in our experimentation with S object's frontal linear size and D distance from the\ncenter of the eyes for all the subjects. Each observer was seated at a table with a monitor and\ncomputer, he was told to look binocularly at the figure, no fixation point was given, and it was\nadopted a passive attitude towards the figure without any effort to hold one percept or to favour\nreversals. The observer was requested to stop by pressing a key at the computer when he was aware\nto have thought one percept and only one after direct verification of the existing ambiguity in the\nfigure. The ambiguous figures were placed in front of the eyes of the observer at a distance of 60\ncm, and illuminated by a lamp of 60 W located above and behind the observer's had. The\nexperimental room was kept under daylight illumination. The constant visual angle was realized for\neach subject using an S object's frontal linear size of about 26 cm for the figure on the monitor.\n5. Results of the Experiment\nThe results of the present experimentation confirmed that mental states follow quantum mechanics\nduring perception and cognition of ambiguous figures. They still confirm the results that on the\n\n\fsame subject we had previously obtained with some different experimental arrangements. So we\nretain that by such our final experimentation we have reached a final conclusion on this subject On\nthe basis of the (3.1) we may confirm that mental states follow quantum mechanics during\nperception and cognitive performance of human brain for ambiguous percepts and cognition. The\nengaged quantum model indicates that human beings can potentially have multiple representations\nof a given choice situation but can attend to only one representation at any given time via a\nquantum mechanical jump. In the quantum mechanical framework that we propose, we distinguish\na potential and an actual or manifest state of consciousness. The state of the potential consciousness\nwill be represented by a vector in Hilbert space. If we indicate as example a bi dimensional case\nwith states indicated by / 1 > and by / 2 > , the potential state of consciousness will be given by\n\u03c8 = a / 1 > +b / 2 > .In this case the (2.1) must be verified. The results that we obtained, are reported\nare reported in Table1. It is seen that we obtain cos \u03b8 (+) = \u22120.307 , and thus \u03b8 (+ ) = 1.882. This\nresult unequivocally confirms that mental states follow a quantum mechanical regime in presence of\nperception and cognition of ambiguous figures. In this manner , according to the (2.3) we may also\nwrite the quantum like wave function \u03c6 S (+) of the mental state S of the group of human beings\ninvestigated, and it results to be given in the following manner (see the 2.3):\n\u03c6 (+) = [0.615 \u00d7 0.750]1 / 2 + e i\u03b8 ( + ) [0.385 \u00d7 0.800]1 / 2 \u2248 0.679 + 0.554 i for mental variable A with\nassumed value +.\nAnalogous procedure we could use to calculate \u03c6 (\u2212) that is relative to the mental variable A with\nassumed valued A = \u2212.\nIn conclusion, in this paper we have reached two important results: we have given a rather\ndefinitive question that quantum mechanics enters in the dynamics of mental states during to\nperception and cognition of human beings of ambiguous features. We have also given body to some\nfundamental quantum mechanical elaboration as in particular the calculation of quantum like wave\nfunction for mental states. It cannot be excluded that this result also promises in perspective\nimportant advances on the plane of interpretation of dynamics of mind and its functions also in\ncases of normal and or subjects with pathologies.\n\nFigure A\n\nFigure B\n\n\fTab. 1\nTest A\nSubject\n\nTest B\n\nCAT (+) SWAN (-)\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n\nSTORK (+)\n\n*\n*\n\nA/B\n\nRABBIT (-)\n\n*\n*\n*\n*\n\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n\nCAT (+)\n\n*\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n*\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n*\n*\n*\n\n*\n\np(A=+)\n\np(A= -)\n\np(B=+)\n\np(B= -)\n\n0.538\n\n0.462\n\n0.615\n\n0.385\n\n*\n*\n*\n*\n\n*\n*\n\n*\n\n*\n\n\u2206p=-0.231\n\nSWAN (-)\n\ncos \u03b8=-0.307\n\n*\n*\n*\np(A=+/B=+) p(A=+/B= -)\n\n0.750\n\n0.800\n\n\u03b8=1.882\n\nTab. 2\nStatistical analysis: Student's t-test\nI\n\nII\n\nIII\n\nIV\n\nV\n\nVI\n\nVII\n\np(A=+)\n\np(A= -)\n\np(B=+)\n\np(B= -)\n\np(A=+/B=+)\n\np(A=+/B= )\n\np(B=+)p(A=+/B=+)+p(B=)p(A=+/B=-)\n\n1\n\n0.6923\n\n0.3077\n\n0.9259\n\n0.0741\n\n0.6800\n\n0.5000\n\n0.6667\n\n2\n\n0.5714\n\n0.4286\n\n1.0000\n\n0.0000\n\n0.7000\n\n0.0000\n\n0.7000\n\n3\n\n0.4545\n\n0.5455\n\n0.7000\n\n0.3000\n\n0.4286\n\n1.0000\n\n0.6000\n\n4\n\n0.5380\n\n0.4620\n\n0.6150\n\n0.3850\n\n0.7500\n\n0.8000\n\n0.7692\n\nMean Value\n\n0.5641\n\n0.4360\n\n0.8102\n\n0.1898\n\n0.6397\n\n0.5750\n\n0.6840\n\n0.0986 0.0986 0.1823 0.1823\nSt. Dev.\nnumber of examined subjects n=124.\nt-test results: P value=0.0951 (significance, P> 90%)\nt=1.979\n\n0.1437\n\n0.4349\n\n0.0704\n\nExperiments\n\n\fWe may now add the following integration of the previous results. They are summarised in\nTab.3.\nThe first time we group all the 124 subjects that we employed in all the experimentation and,\nconsidering it as only one group, independently of the nature of Tests A and B that we used, we\nproceed to the calculation of cos \u03b8 and thus of \u03b8 for the only group of subjects. As seen by Tab.3\nwe obtain the value \u03b8 = 1.6942 .In the second case, instead, we considered still the group of the four\nexperiments that we performed and on this basis we calculated \u03b8 = 1.722367 \u00b1 0.173423 (For\nsignificance we add also the t-test value that was obtained in this case).\n\nIt seems to us that the result that we obtain is of valuable interest. In brief, we confirm first of all\nthat mental states exhibit quantum like interference of probabilities in Human Subjects during their\nperception and cognition in perspective reversals of ambiguous visual patterns, but the most salient\nresult seems that the quantum like regime of mental states happen with an invariant as phase angle\ncharacterizing quantum interference of probabilities. In the case of examining the whole group of\nsubjects we had in fact \u03b8 = 1.6942 while in the case of the four considered experiments separately,\nwe had \u03b8 = 1.722367 \u00b1 0.173423 , that is very similar to the previous one. In conclusion, quantum\nlike regime of mental states could be regulated by a presently unknown mechanism signed by an\ninvariance in the phase angle expressing quantum like interference of probabilities in all normal\nsubjects as those we investigated.\nTab.3\nStatistical analysis: Student's t-test.

The Theoretical Framework.\nBell's theorem was published in a fundamental paper of physics in 1964 [1]. In 1975 Stapp defined Bell's\ntheorem \"The most profound discovery of science\" [2]. We have to observe that He speaks here respect to\nscience and not only respect to physics. Let us remember what the theorem states: it shows that the\npredictions of quantum mechanics are not intituitive and they relate the most fundamental issues of our\nphysical, physolosophical, epistemological and onthological reality. It enphasizes that no physical theory of\nlocal hidden variables may ever reproduces all of the predictions of quantum mechanics. It is the most\nfamous legacy that we encounter in physics.\nOf course it is well known that Einstein was critical respect to standard interpretation of quantum\n\nmechanics. The celebrated EPR paper [3] showed that the standard interpretation of such theory,\nimplies either its incompleteness or \"spooky action-at-a-distance\". Einstein wanted to get rid of the\n\"action-at-a-distance\" by assuming incompleteness of quantum mechanics and introducing \"local\nhidden variables.\" Bell's theorem, published in 1964, is considered to prove that it is possible to\nconstruct experiments in which it is impossible for any kind of interpretation based on \"local hidden\nvariables\" to give the same predictions as quantum mechanics, providing a means of testing whether\n\"action-at-a-distance\" actually occurs. A lot of experiments have been conducted in physics\nconfirming fully the validity of quantum heory [4].\nRather recently, on the theoretical plane, analysis has been performed of probabilistic assumptions\nof Bell's formulation. One of us [5], Andrei Khrennikov, has emphasized that J. Bell wrote about\nprobability withouth to specify the concrete axiomatics of probability theory. His analysis shows\nthat Bell did not apply the classical probability model, that, as it is well known, is based on\nKolmogorov model to describe classical physical framework.In substance he introduced his own\nprobabilistic model and compared it with quantum mechanics.The crucial point for the present\npaper is that he did not payed attention to conditional probabilities. In detail, [5], in this model it\nwas shown that the conditional probabilities in Bell elaboration cannot be defined by classical\nBayes formula. In [5] it was used the approach based on Bell- type inequalities in the conventional\n\n\fapproach of the Kolmogorov model. Khrennikov showed an analog of Wigner inequality [6] for\nconditional probabilities, and, on this basis, evidenced in detail that the predictions of the\nconventional and quantum probability models must disagree.\nThia result represents an important advance because, in addition to the important theoeretical\nelucidation that it reaches, on its basis we become finally able to perform experiments in various\nfields having in this manner the possibility to discuss the possible violation of Bell inquality in very\ndifferent fields of interest. Our aim is confined to investigation of mental states brain dynamics,\nand in paricular to perception and cognition of human beings. We will discuss in detail such featues\nof the argument within few time, but before let us add some further important considerations.\nIn particular in this moment, but the question was in some manner signed fom the starting of the\ntheory, quantum mechanics suffers of a net dichotomy. We have a group of researchers that\nstrongly is inclined to accept that quantum mechanics is a theory that speaks only about physical\nsystems. In this manner it excludes, as example, the possibility to analyze cognitive systems by this\ntheory and its basic fundations. On the contrary, there is another current of research that in\nprinciple is available to admit a larger field of pertinence of quantum mechanics, that is to say that\nit should not pertain uniquely to only physical systems but such enlarged field of reference could\nregard in particular brain dynamics, and, in particular, the sphere of the mental states in human\nbeings. We retain to have given recently a net and definitive answer to this fundamental question.\nAccumulating results for about more than five years of experimental research, we have shown in a\nconclusive paper that that mental states follow quantum mechanics during perception and cognition\nof ambiguous figures in a very large group of human subjects. The results have been published by\nus in arXiv: 0802.1835 [7] and references therein.The mentioned papers contain all the elements to\nfollow in detail the articulated experimentation that was performed.\nSome points must be outlined respect to such results:\n1) First of all, they confirm that quantum mechanics is an elaborated theory that does not\nconfines itself to analysis of physical systems only as admitted by some groups of research.\n2) For the first time we identify a physical theory that shows to have direct and fundamental\nrelevance in the sphere of mental and brain dynamics with particular relevance during\nhuman perception and cognition. This is a result that opens new perspectives in the sphere of\nscientific knowledge since it gives a decisive contributin to the important problem to\nundertsand human consciousness indicating for the first time the way in which we may\nconceive and explore it in formal terms based on a physical theory. It is rather obvious to\nexpect that , having identified for the first time the formal theory to be followed in treating\nmental states and consciousnes, new important perspectives are open with particular\nrelevance for the corresponding correlates at the level of psychological but also\nneurophysiological levels. Recently [8] studies were conducted by various authors analysing\nin detail the electrophysiological correlates of perceptual reversals in the case of three\ndifferent types of multistable images as the modified Rubin'sface/vase, the Necker cube and\nLemmo's cheetahs. The results seem to support a model of multistable perception in wich\nchanges in early partial attention modulate perceptual reversals.The link of this model with\na possible quantum mechanical framework seems rather evident.\n3) There is finally an onthological consideration. It is significant for the manner in which our\nresults must be considered. To this purpose, any reductionistic approach must be excluded.\nQuantum mechanics must not be intended as the theory to which we reduce the functioning\nof the brain as many authors outlined in the past [9]. Brain dynamics represents the most\nextensive system holding on a very complex dynamics, and it deserves to be analized and\nundestood under different profiles including also, and in particular, some approaches of\n\n\fphysiscs as chaos theory. Our results simply indicate that the principles, the epistemological\nand onthological foundations of quantum mechanics certainly enter in the so articulated\ndescription and analysis of consciousnes and of mental states of human beings. Quantum\nmechanics certainly enters in brain dynamics but it is not the only theory by which we may\nhave the presumption to explain brain complexity. This is the most promising feature of our\nrecent discovery: to have ascertained with a net degree of accuracy the real role of quantum\ntheory in brain dynamics, but any reductionistic approach is excluded by us.\nIn order to support our thesis, we would now perform a step on. It would be to analyze mental\nstates of a gropup of human subjects verifying directly the possibility and the conditions under\nwhich a violation of Bell inquality may turn out in the analysis of mental states of subjects during\ntheir perception and cognition of ambigous figures.\nTo this purpose in the present paper we have performed a first experiment on Bell inequality,\narriving to establish the conditions in which it may be violated.\nWe will indicate here the results that we have obtained and we will indicate also the\nneurophysiological basis that we must follow in order to obtain Bell violation in perception and\ncognition of human during their perception of ambigous figures.\n2. The Theoretical basis of the Experiment\n\nAs previously said, the aim of our program of experimentation was to analyse quantum-like\nbehaviour of mental states by the analysis of Bell's inequality.\nWe followed step by step the previous results obtained in [5] to which the reader is re sent for the\nrelative deepening. Let us start considering the well known Wigner inequality [6] that this author\nevidenced for Bell inequality [5].\nLet a, b, c = \u00b11 be arbitrary dichotomous random variables on a single Kolmogorov space S. Then\nthe following inequality holds true\np (a = +1, b = +1) + p(c = +1, b = \u22121) \u2265 p(a = +1, c = +1)\n(1.1)\nThe proof of this theorem and a detailed discussion on the subject may be found in [5,7].\nWe recall now that conditional probabilities in the Kolmogorov model are defined by using Bayes'\nformula and thus writing\np (a = a1 , b = b1 )\n(1.2)\np (a = a1 / b = b1 ) =\np (b = b1 )\nThe aim of the test that we perform is easily explained :\nA family of observables which does not permit such statistical realistic description will be\ncalled to follow a quantum like behaviour.\nUsing the (1.2) in the (1.1) , we obtain that\np (a = +1 / b = +1) + p(c = +1 / b = +1) \u2265 p(a = +1 / c = +1)\n(1.3)\nthat is the analogue of Bell's inequality for conditional probabilities. If this inequality is\nviolated in experiments by mental states we will conclude that in this particular experimental, the\nmind states behave quantum like violating Bell inequality with respect to questions a, b, and c.\n3. The Description of the Experiment\n\nA group S of 144 subjects was divide into two subgroups U of 72 subjects and V of 72 subjects. To\nthe group U the test B was given with possible answers B + and B \u2212 . To subject answering B + , it\nwas subsequently given the test A with possible answers A + and A \u2212 respectively. To subjects\nanswering B \u2212 , it was given instead the test C with possible answers C + and C \u2212 . To subjects\n\n\fpertaining the subgroup V , it was given test instead the test C with C + and C \u2212 as possible answers.\nTo subjects answering C + , it was finally given the test A with possible answers A + and A \u2212 .

Refinement of the previous calculations.\n\nWe must give now some comments of valuable importance.\na.\nFirst of all we must outline that such results do not invalidate the results that recently\nwe obtained in ref [7] where we showed that mental states follow quantum mechanics\nduring perception and cognition of ambiguous figures. Inequalities of Bell kind by\nthemselves have nothing to do with quantum theory. As correctly outlined by J.H. Eberly\n[10], contexts as different as downhill skiers [11] and laundered socks [12] were used to\ndemonstrate this. This is the first important point to outline.\nb.\nThere is another important feature that was recently evidenced by Pitk\u00e4nen [13]. He\noutlined that if the failure of inequality does not occur, this does not of course mean that the\nsystem is classical but only that the quantal effects, in the proper version that we\nexperienced, were not large enough.\nc.\nFinally, according to [13], the Bell inequality that we have used in the present\nexperimentation suggests that the questions we posed to human beings, and consisting in\n\n\fTests A, B, C, previously seen ,must be considered to be analogous to spins in spin pair of\nspin singlet states in an external magnetic field and determining a quantization axis. In other\nterms [13], the failure of Bell inequality is expected if the ambiguous figures were used by\nus in a manner that produced bistable percepts differing enough.\nd.\nWe arrive in this manner to the crucial conclusion of the present paper. In quantum\ntheory we have, as usually admitted, quantum observables. They are physical quantum\nobservables. Owing to the results the we obtained recently [7], and showing, we repeat, that\nmind states follow quantum mechanics during perception and cognition of ambiguous\nfigures, we must conclude under a very new perspective : we have also mental observables,\nthat as it was recently shown by us, follow quantum mechanics at least during perception\nand cognition of ambiguous figures. These mental observables are represented by the three\nabstract set ( e1 , e2 , e3 ) of the algebraic structure that we have used several times in our\npapers [14]. They may pertain to the sphere of mind activity and logic as well as also to the\nphysical sphere as it is the case of physical particles where the projections of spins in three\nperpendicular reference directions are represented by the well known Pauli matrices,\n1\n1\n1\nS1 = he1 , S 2 = he2 , S 3 = he3 . Also the projections of the magnetic moment are given\n2\n2\n2\nby physical observables as \u03bce1 , \u03bce2 , \u03bce3 . However, the ei (i = 1,2,3) , considered as\nalgebraic abstract elements in the manner discussed by us in a number of previous papers\n[14], represent mind-logical observables in a quantum like version of the theory .\ne.\nFinally, if in the present case of the experimentation, given in figure 1, we consider\nthe tests A, B, C, as expressed by the algebraic sets (e1 , e2 , e3 ) , we arrive to find cases in\nwhich Bell inequality may be violated and we find also the neurophysiological correlates to\nsuch experimental condition.\nf.\nFinally, we intend to evaluate here still the hypothesis to consider the algebraic set\n(e1 , e2 , e3 ) as mental logic observables. It is not new here. Yuri Orlov, formulating his well\nknown wave logic, in 1982, in an important paper entitled \"The Wave Logic of\nConsciousness: A Hypothesis\" at pag. 41 wrote textually [15] :\nAccording to my paper presented at the 5th Congress on Philosophy, Methodology of\nScience and Mathematical Logic, every atomic proposition of classical logic can be\nrepresented by a diagonal operator-the third component of the Pauli algebra e3 :\n\u239b1 0 \u239e\n\u239f\u239f , e32 = 1 , e3\u2217 = 1\ne3 = \u239c\u239c\n\u239d 0 \u2212 1\u23a0\nThis so authoritative affirmation represents the most convincing support to our positions.\nIt remains now to show how Bell inequality could be violated in our experiment of Figure 1, based\non mental states. Let us assume the Tests A, B, C, corresponding to mental observables, are given in\nthe following manner:\nTest A = cos \u03b81e3 + sen\u03b81e1 ; Test B= cos \u03b82 e3 + sen\u03b82 e1 ; Test C = cos \u03b83 e3 + sen\u03b83 e1 .\nThis may be now written on the basis of the previous positions that we introduced.\nWe have AB \u2260 BA , AC \u2260 CA, BC \u2260 CB\nwhere AB \u2261 Test A Test B = cos(\u03b81 \u2212 \u03b8 2 ) \u2212 isen(\u03b81 \u2212 \u03b8 2 )e2\nand B A \u2261 Test B Test A= cos(\u03b81 \u2212 \u03b8 2 ) + isen(\u03b81 \u2212 \u03b8 2 )e2\nwhere AC \u2261 Test A Test C = cos(\u03b81 \u2212 \u03b83 ) \u2212 isen(\u03b81 \u2212 \u03b83 )e2\nand C A \u2261 Test C Test A= cos(\u03b81 \u2212 \u03b83 ) + isen(\u03b81 \u2212 \u03b83 )e2\n(1.7)\nwhere BC \u2261 Test B Test C = cos(\u03b82 \u2212 \u03b83 ) \u2212 isen(\u03b82 \u2212 \u03b83 )e2\nand C B \u2261 Test C Test B = cos(\u03b82 \u2212 \u03b83 ) + isen(\u03b82 \u2212 \u03b83 )e2 .\nWe know that\n\n\fp(a= \u03b1 i / b= \u03b2 i )= < \u03c6 ia , \u03c6 ib >\n\n{ }\n\nbeing \u03c6 ia and\nWe have\n\n2\n\n{\u03c6 } normalized set of\nb\ni\n\neigenvectors, respectively.\n\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\u03c3 (\u03b8 )\u03c6 + (\u03b8 ) = \u03c6 + (\u03b8 ) with \u03c6 + (\u03b8 ) = (cos , sen )\n2\n\n2\n\nand\n\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\u03c3 (\u03b8 )\u03c6 \u2212 (\u03b8 ) = \u2212\u03c6 \u2212 (\u03b8 ) with \u03c6 \u2212 (\u03b8 ) = (\u2212 sen , cos )\n\n2\n2\nIn conclusion, instead of the (1.3) and the (1.5) we obtain now that\n\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b82\n\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b82\n; p(c=+ / b=-) = sen 2 3\n, and finally\np(a=+ / b=+)= cos 2 1\n2\n2\n\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b83\np(a=+1,c=+1) = cos 2 1\n(1.8).\n2\nIn conclusion, the (1.5), before non violated, now becomes\n\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b82\n\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b83\n\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b82\ncos 2 1\n(1.9)\n+ sen 2 3\n\u2265 cos 2 1\n2\n2\n2\nthat represents the central equation of our paper, for details see in particular ref [5 and 6].\nAccording to [5,6], a simple solution of the (1.9) may be given assuming \u03b81 = 0,\u03b82 = 6\u03b8 ,\u03b83 = 2\u03b8 .\nInstead of the (1.9), one obtains that\ncos 2 3\u03b8 + sen 2 2\u03b8 \u2265 cos 2 \u03b8\n(1.10)\nIn Figure2 we give in red the sum of the two terms on the left and in blue the term on the right of\nthe inequality (1.10).\nAs expected, we see that we have regions of \u03b8 in which Bell's inequality for mental states may be\nviolated.\n\nFigure 2: Regions of Bell's violation (eqn. 1.10 in the text)\n2\n\ncos 2(3 \u03b8)+sen 2(2\u03b8)\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\ncos 2(\u03b8)\n0\n0.00 0.31 0.63 0.94 1.26 1.57 1.88 2.20 2.51 2.83 3.14 3.45 3.77 4.08 4.40 4.71 5.02 5.34 5.65 5.97 6.28\n\n\u03b8 (rad)\n\nIn [13] a more articulated equation was obtained to solve\ncos \u03b823 \u2212 cos \u03b821 > 1 \u2212 cos \u03b813\n(1.11)\nthat deserves still consideration.\nThe conclusion of all such elaboration is that Bell's inequality may be violated also in the case of\nexperiments based on mental states during perception and cognition of ambiguous figures.\n\n\f5. Neurophysiological Correlates\nAlthough the (1.10) represents a rough approximation respect to the (1.9), it helps us in identifying\nthe correct psychological and neurphysiological procedure we must follow during experimentation\nin order to identify Bell's inequality violation.\nLet us start with the results the we recently obtained in [7]. In order to perform our Test A and the\ntests A/B we adopted always the same visual angle. We repeat here that it has been shown that\nperception and cognition in ambiguous figures is influenced by visual angle [16]. Therefore a\nconstant visual angle V = 2arctg ( S / 2d ) = 0.33 rad . was used by us in our experimentation with\nS object's frontal linear size and d distance from the center of the eyes for all the subjects. Let us\nrepresent in Figure 3 the neurophysiological condition.\n\nFigure3: visual angle and its neurophysiological correlate\nthrough the region of interested retina\n\nWe see that, among the possible stimulus variable affecting the reversal phenomenon, we have also\nthe size of the ambiguous figure. The reason is very complicated from the viewpoint of the\nphysiology but in brief we may say that, when the size of the pattern changes, the visual angle\nsubtended from the observer's eye varies and with it varies also the portion of retina involved. A\nnet relation is established among visual angle, quantities describing perceptual alternation and\nneurophysiological correlates. From the experimental point of view, we must realize figures each\ntime with different side of the figure given as Test (consider a Necker cube to simplify). Each time,\nduring the Test, we will have a different portion of retina involved and with a selected rotation of\nthe retina employed. It will represent the required relation between the neurophysyology and the\nspinlike quantization rotation that we need. Conditional probabilities will vary each time finally\nfinding those giving Bell's inequality violation.\nNo doubt may exist that in perspective the quantum mechanics will be strongly improved and\npowered. According to Orlov [15] , this is a theory that reaches a so profound state of elaboration\nand description that is able to account at the same time of the physical processes of our reality as\nwell as of the perceptive and cognitive features that pertain to our reality. A confirmation of this\nthesis resides in the fact that we may also write very simple textbooks of quantum mechanics , using\nas formal instruments only the algebraic set (e1 , e2 , e3 ) , and developing full arguments as the\nquantization, the harmonic oscillator, the orbital angular momentum, the hydrogen atom, the time\nevolution of quantum systems, the EPR and Bell's inequality and other basic foundations of such\ntheory never using the traditional methods of quantum theory but only this algebraic set (e1 , e2 , e3 ) ,\nand its isomorphic matrices [17]. Quantum mechanics is a Giano Bifronte (two-faced Giano, a\nmythological God of the past), looking from one hand to physical field and from the other hand to\nthe sphere of mental reality.\n\n\f6. Conclusion\nA conclusion seems to appear in its evidence.\nA number of statistical tests of quantum like behaviour of cognitive systems has been elaborated\nand corresponding experiments were designed and performed. In [7, 14] we presented results of our\ntheoretical and experimental research on mental probabilistic interference. In this paper we studied\n(again both theoretically and experimentally) a Bell-type test for perception of ambiguous figures.\nThis test occurs to be essentially more complicated from the point of view of experimental\nmethodology than our previous test on the interference of probabilities.. We performed detailed\nanalysis (including quantum mechanical probabilistic framework in coupling with neurophysiology)\nwhich demonstrated that, although at we have not yet been able to violate Bell's inequality in the\nambiguous - perception experiments, there are strong theoretical arguments supporting our\nexpectation to violate it. We explored the method used in quantum mechanics for description of\nspin-observables. It is well known that algebra of corresponding operators has a direct coupling to\ngeometry \u2013 via representing spin observable by trigonometric linear combinations of Pauli\nmatrices. We proceeded by identifying spin geometry with geometry given by the visual angle and\nits neurophysiological correlate through retina. We hope that our analysis provides the solid ground\nfor further investigations on quantum like behaviour of cognitive systems.\n\nReferences\n1) J.S.
