The decay of our aging\nuniverse is reviewed first. The accelerated expansion takes the decay debris into the interuniversal medium (IUM) of the multiverse, which conserves it on a 1030-years time scale.\nA prominent component of the debris and of the IUM is the enormous number of old cold\nphotons from the decaying universes among the 1019 in our Local Group of universes.\nThe numerous old photons made the accretion possible of the large mass for our protouniverse, equivalent to 1021 solar masses, without black-hole collapse. This was\naccomplished by the energy-seeking property of the old debris material, and by the\nphoton's acceleration property that counteracts some of the gravity.\nWhen a central volume of our proto-universe reached 1018 kg m-3 (proton density), and\n1013 K, the old photons and protons became fully re-energized. That was a small central\nvolume, apparently ~4.6 % of the total. Outside of that volume, the large numbers of\nremaining old photons continued their acceleration and the expansion of our universe.\nThe above accretion and expansion are described a second time with what we know\nabout dark energy, particularly its acceleration of the expansion at age 5 x 109 of our\nuniverse. Identical results are obtained; in fact, the two descriptions are complementary,\nand the conclusion is thereby made that dark energy is the acceleration energy of old\nphotons.\nThere are two confirmations of the model. First, Karl Schwarzschild's limit allows this\npossibility (but not the Big Bang), and even confirms the mass of universes of our\nuniverse. Second, the old photons from decaying universes would have choked the\nsystem if they would not have been used; we would not have been here.\nThe model is supported by 30 observations, and by 19 considerations for future work,\nand that is a precious situation in present-day cosmology.\nSubject headings: multiverse, universe, photons, dark energy, expansion.\n1. INTRODUCTION\nThis arXiv.1101.0161 paper is a sequel to five papers since 2007 that are readily\nperused by selecting their http references in www.lpl.arizona.edu/faculty/gehrels2.html.\nA popular book has the assembly of all work on this model to date (Gehrels 2011a). The\nmodel is based on several observations, and its basic equation had been discovered by\nSubrahmanyan Chandrasekhar (1910-1995). I was in his class on stellar evolution in the\n1950s and remembered how he stressed the possibility that the equation might show\ndeeper relations between atomic theory and cosmogony; he published the equation at\nleast four times (Chandrasekhar 1937, 1951, 1983, 1989). However, the time was not ripe\n\n\f2\nto do anything with the equation until there would be consistent observations and\nunderstanding of our universe (Hinshaw 2010). An example is the discovery of the\nacceleration of the expansion (Riess et al. 1998; Perlmutter et al. 1999). The expected\ndeceleration would have prevented this model, while accelerated expansion brings the\ndebris of our aging and decay into the inter-universal medium as material for new\nuniverses on a time-scale of 1030 years.\nThis paper explores if a model based on such a powerful equation can tell us the\nphysical nature of the major component of our universe, dark energy. And indeed, a\nsolution to the dark-energy problem is readily found; it is rather model independent valid for any multiverse, not just the Chandra Multiverse - as follows.\nEverything ages and decays - protons have a half-life of at least 1035 years - and the\ndebris floats on the accelerated expansion of intergalactic space into the inter-universal\nmedium (IUM), in which our universe is imbedded. When a new universe is accreted\nfrom an IUM cloud to make a proto-universe, the photons and protons eventually reach\n1013 K and proton density of 1018 kg m-3; these are parameters from atomic theory for\nthem to be completely re-energized. That is the beginning of a new universe like ours, at\n10-6 s on the old clock (1037 Planck times beyond a Big Bang); as for what happened\nearlier, the subatomic physics of <10-6 s are the domain of the multiverse.\nThis scenario is tried a second time with what we know about dark energy. The result\nof the events is the same, more complete in fact. Dark energy is therefore another name\nfor the acceleration energy by old photons; their lack of observability is in Sec. 3.1.\nSection 2 first shows the powerful physics for the model, and Sec. 3 the history of our\nuniverse; these sections are brief because their details are in the above five papers.\nSection 4 has the physics for the beginning of our universe, which leads to the discovery\nof the physics of dark energy in Sec. 5. Section 6 shows two independent confirmations.\nSection 7 summarizes 30 supporting observations and considerations, Sec. 8 lists future\nwork, and Sec. 9 has a summary. This paper is followed by arXiv.1101.0567, on the\nphysics and identity of dark matter.\n2. THE PHYSICS OF THE MULTIVERSE\nChandrasekhar (1951), in his course on the structure, the composition, and the source\nof radiation of the stars, derived an equation for masses in our quantized universe,\nM(\u03b1) = (hc/G)\u03b1 H1-2\u03b1,\n\n(1)\n\nin which h is the Planck constant, c the velocity of radiation, G Newton's gravitational\nconstant, and H the mass of the proton; it is for positive exponents \u03b1 identifying the\nobjects shown in Table 1.1. From his derivation of Eq. (1), it appears to have quantum,\nrelativity, gravity, and atomic physics unified in the cosmos, and that is awesome. Planck\n(1899) expressed such awe, and that was merely for his constant h, with,\n\"... the possibility is given to establish units for length, mass, time and temperature,\nwhich, independent of special bodies or substances, keep their meaning for all\ntimes and for all cultures, including extraterrestrial and non-human ones, and which\ntherefore can be called 'natural measurement units' \"\nThe unit we are interested in here is for mass, (hc/G)0.5, now called the Planck mass; he\nhad obtained them all by dimensional analysis, while Chandra's derivation calibrated\n\n\f3\nthem. The second term of Eq. (1) serves merely so that any mass unit can be used, such\nas kg or solar masses. A \"universal Planck mass\" appeared when I simplified Eq. (1) by\nexpressing all masses in terms of the universal unit of the proton mass, such that H = 1,\nand\nM(\u03b1) = (hc/G)\u03b1.\n(2)\nChandra had already made some comparison with observations, I pursued that, and\nalso found that the objects in Table 1.1 are the only ones participating in M(\u03b1), with the\npossible exception for planetesimals at \u03b1 = 1.00. The equations are however open to\nhigher values of \u03b1; only the first quantization step in the multiverse is shown in the Table.\nAnother way to show the quantization is in whole steps that emphasize the Planck mass,\nM(N) = (hc/G)0.5N.\n\n(3)\n\nThe Table has values computed with these three expressions, and the last column shows\nthe result of comparisons with observations.\nTABLE 1.1\nMASSES DERIVED FROM THE ABOVE EQUATIONS\n====================================================================================\n\nPredicted\nType of\nObserved\n\u03b1 N Proton masses Units shown\nObject\n\u03b1\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------2.50 5 3.68 x 1097 3.26 x 1019 un Local Group of Universes\n2.00 4 1.13 x 1078 9.52 x 1020 s. m.

THE HISTORY OF OUR UNIVERSE\n3.1. The Ending of our Universe\nThe ending is considered first because the participating components are then easily\nidentified for usage in the multiverse and proto-universe. Everything in a universe ages\nand decays; even the proton may have a limited half-life.\nOld cold protons and other particles such as neutrons and electrons are part of our\nuniverse's decay debris, as are whole galaxies (each gravitationally holding its debris),\nclusters of galaxies, and whatever other debris such as old stars. Their ensemble is\ndefined as protons etc. In addition, dark matter and dark energy are abundant in our\nuniverse.\nPhotons are especially important in this scenario; their properties are curiously unique,\nas if they evolved in the multiverse for the role we see them play (Lamb 1995). Foremost\n\n\f4\nis their acceleration: with velocity always c, they impart momentum in collisions with\nobjects they encounter; a solar sail is a special example, and we will discuss the\ninteraction with protons later. The photons seem to vanish when and only when their\nenergy has been transferred through acceleration to the charged particles or other objects.\nApparently, they keep all but one of their properties at all temperatures; the exception\nbeing the radiation depending on temperature. The declining amount of radiation of the\n\"old photons\" is observed in terms of cooling in space on the expansion of our universe;\nCOBE and other surveys observed it at 3000 K for age 380,000, and near 3 K at present.\nDuring their long stay in the multiverse, they must be near absolute zero.\n3.2. In the Chandra Multiverse\nIf our universe decays into the inter-universal medium (IUM) - and had originated\nfrom it - the IUM will have our physics. The IUM has uniformity through mixing of\ndebris from a large number of universes, which had all emerged from the IUM to begin\nwith, such that they all have that h, c, G, H physics.\nThe fundamental characteristic of the multiverse is that it is an evolutionary system\n(Gehrels 2011b). Evolution considers slightly different characteristics of nature's\ncomponents, occurring by chance, caused by the environment in natural selection. Will\nthe species survive with them, or is the difference too great so as not to survive? One\nspeaks then of trial-and-error evolution. A universe may have characteristics that deviate\ntoo much so that it will not survive, and it vanishes back into the IUM. Or, a universe\nmay emerge with slightly different characteristics.\nIn this manner, the multiverse evolved the physics of the universes, like ours, which is\nso finely tuned that it can produce stars, planets, and people. That extreme fine-tuning\nhas been a puzzle for decades for it could not have happened in a single and rapidly\ndeveloping early Big-Bang universe. Fred Hoyle's name is associated with that, how he\nwondered, in books and lectures, about the extreme fine-tuning of atomic specifications\nin stars. Now we know however that the multiverse has many samples of universes, 1019\nin the Local Group, that evolve for long times, estimated at 1030 years; they should then\nbe highly successful in evolution, as Darwin's finches and people demonstrate.\n3.3. The Beginning of our Universe\nClouds probably form in the IUM as in the interstellar medium (ISM). The supply from\nmany aging and decaying universes into the IUM is on average uniform as well as\ncontinuous, even though the universes are born at randomly different times depending on\nwhen their cloud began to form. Nothing stands still in the cosmos - the clouds continue\nto grow by sweeping the material up during their motion through space. Eventually, selfgravitation will become active, speeding the accretion of the cloud by its increasing\ngravitational cross-section.\nThere is a classical problem that a cloud of mass equivalent to 1021 solar masses would\nbe far too massive, it would get too hot and all characteristics would be melted away; it\nwould probably collapse into a black hole. Now however, there are two causes why that\nproblem may have been solved. First, the acceleration pressure of photons provides\ncounter-action to gravity, as we shall see in detail in Sec. 4. Second, the IUM\ncomposition differs from that in the ISM, namely of the above decayed energy seeking\ndebris, instead of the usual atomic and molecularly active ISM material.\n\n\f5\nThe growing proto-universe therefore has a maximum temperature of 1013 K, which is\napparently all right for the mass concentrations of galactic clusters in our debris to have\nsurvived in our universe (#14 in Sec. 7).\nImagine a gravitationally spherical cloud of about the size of the Venus orbit having\nuniformly mixed debris. Gravitational energy of compaction was used to re-energize the\nold photons and old atomic components into regular photons, protons, neutrons,\nelectrons, etc. When in accretion the central volume obtained the density of 1018 kg m-3 which is the density at which photons and protons formed in standard modeling - the old\nphotons and protons were fully re-energized. There is the peculiar fact that only 4.6% of\nthe mass of our universe is baryonic, our visible matter. Why it is so small has been a\npuzzle, but now it is seen in the simple spherical geometry of a gravitational globe. With\nhighest density at the center, a maximum-density central mass will be a small fraction of\nthe whole; it apparently was only 4.6 %.\nOutside of the 4.6% volume, the re-energizing and re-constitution did not come to\ncompletion because of insufficient density. Old photons and old protons etc. remained at\ntheir high percentages and they continued their acceleration interaction in multiple\nscattering, sustaining expansion.\nBack to the central region, it had also its old protons re-energized; 1018 kg m-3 actually\nis proton density, at 1013 K, while t ~ 10-6 s is the epoch of their formation in standard\nmodeling. The new photons interacted with the new protons in multiple scattering, also\nby electrons and neutrons. The epoch of t ~ 10-6 s is the beginning of our universe, ~1037\nPlanck times away from a Big Bang model - our universe began at the photon and proton\nlevel. Because of the difference of starting our universe, by as many as 1037 Planck times,\nthis model need not and does not consider Strings, Inflation, or early Big Bang theories.\nThe only WMAP observation supporting Inflation theory may just as well support the\nChandra Multiverse, for the sudden appearance of a Venus-orbit sized baryonic object at t\n~ 10-6 s.\nThe physics of before t ~ 10-6 s (that already had been evolved in the multiverse, over\nlong times) was maintained in the multiverse at this epoch, as it always is; this is of\ncourse the h, c, G, H physics of the Chandra Multiverse Model (Sec. 3.2).\nAfter t ~ 10-6 s, the multiple scattering and expansion continued throughout the\nuniverse as well as in the central volume. That lasted until age 380,000, when at space\ndensity of ~10-19 kg m-3 the electrons, protons, and neutrons combined to make hydrogen\nand helium atoms, which have wide internal spacing for the photons to escape through.\n4. THE CAUSE OF EXPANSION OF OUR UNIVERSE\nIn the previous section, the discussion before the epoch of t ~ 10-6 s had accretion in\nour proto-universe, and expansion afterwards. What caused the reversal? \"What caused\nthe expansion?\" is the classic question.\nAlready during the formation of our proto-universe, there was an increasing effect of\nan outward force on the protons etc. The force was due to the acceleration by the\nenormous number of old photons from the decaying universes; i.e, the photons exerted\npressure outward, a negative effect with respect to a positive direction for the inward\ndirection of gravity.\nThe effect was increasing because the scooping up of material from the IUM depended\non the cross section of the cloud. However, its pressure always lagged behind the\n\n\f6\ngravitational force (as the density increased from ~10-28 kg m-3 in the IUM to the proton\ndensity of 1018 kg m-3). This is because it brought the appropriate temperatures from 0 to\n1013 K all right, but always lagging behind, taking time because the cold material had to\nbe heated. The gravity thereby prevailed and the accretion continued, but the dominance\nof the gravity gradually slowed down.\nIt did come to a remarkable stop by a reversal from accretion into expansion when at\nthe center of the cloud the density reached 1018 kg m-3 at which in the standard model the\nbirths of photons and protons occur (Sec. 3.3). There may in fact have been a short\ninterval in which the old photons were re-energized while for the protons etc, it may have\ntaken a little longer because some of them may have had to be re-constituted as well. If\nso, there was the Photon Burst of the 1013-K fireball energetic enough to be observed by\nWMAP as a radiation signature with a wider curvature than that of the 3-K radiation; that\nis of a burst of the radiation well before age 380,000 (Hinshaw 2010).\nBoth these bursts would have pushed the accreting material away from the protouniverse; the blasts had a pressure blowing the IUM material away from the completed\nuniverse. It will be exciting to do the detailed computer modeling; in outline, it has\nalready been done in the Schwarzschild part of Sec. 6, showing the cause for all universes\nto have our universe's mass M.\nContinuing with the beginning-of-our-universe scenario, after the t ~ 10-6 s events the\nacceleration by the photons inside the 4.6-% volume sustained the expansion, as did the\nold photons outside of that volume. However, now the appropriate temperature from 1013\nK to 3,000 K was always lagging behind the decrease of the density from 1018 to 10-19 kg\nm-3, because the cooling took time. The expansion was therefore leading as the pressure\ndeclined.\nAfter t ~ 10-6 s (equal to t = 0 on the Chandra-Multiverse clock), our understanding of\nthe physical evolution appears to be on the track of the standard models for our universe\nand for atomic physics. Our universe had begun with photons and protons, to continue on\nthe path described by the standard models.\n5. THE DISCOVERY\nThis section is to describe again the events leading up to age 380,000, but now not in\nterms of old photons but with what is known about dark energy. The following\npercentages are in terms of mass (Hinshaw 2010):\n1. At the present time, the baryons amount to only 4.6%. Neutrinos have less than 1%,\nwhile 23% is not-observable dark matter. The dominant 72% is in some form of dark\nenergy.\n2. When the universe had age 380,000, it amounted to 12% atoms, 15% regular photons,\nand 10% neutrinos. Not observable but otherwise derived to be present was 63% dark\nmatter. There was little or no dark energy.\nWhile dark energy is presently dominant at the above 72 %, our decaying universe and\nthe inter-universal medium would have kept at least that percentage, and so would the\naccreting proto-universe. In contrast, the above Point 2) shows that at age 380,000 there\nwas little or no dark energy. Apparently, it had been used up.\nThat difference of the two dark-energy observations in Points 1) and 2) can therefore\nbe used to answer the question again, \"What caused the expansion of our universe?\"\nCausing the expansion has the same physical action as accelerating the expansion at age\n\n\f7\n5 x 109, which is in the literature as due to dark energy (Riess et al. 1998). The\nconclusion is therefore that the original expansion is caused by dark energy as well as is\nthe later acceleration.\nIndependent of that conclusion, we have the same course of events and results with\ndark energy as with the above old photons. \"Dark energy\" is therefore a name for what is\nthe physical action of acceleration by old photons. The discovery is that dark energy is\nthe energy of old photons.\n6. TWO CONFIRMATIONS\nThe above two sections are ideal for computer modeling, as was done for the\nChandrasekhar limit to correct it to 1.4 solar masses; presently, the entire model needs to\nbe verified.\nThe dark-energy conclusion has a simple but firm confirmation. The evolution in the\nmultiverse could not have left unused the major part of what all decaying universes\ncontribute to the IUM, namely their old photons (or, in the second interpretation, their\n72% dark energy). If these would have been left unused, the ever-increasing number of\nold-photon debris (i.e. dark energy) would have choked the multiverse.\nA confirmation comes from the warning initiated by Schwarzschild (1916). It is seen\nsimply as a limiting radius of the proto-universe, RS, for light to escape, at which the\nlocal gravity is equal to or less than the energy of the light,\nRS = 2GM c-2.\n\n(4.1)\n\nTable 6.1 shows the comparison of RS with radius R = (3M/4\u03c0\u03c3)1/3 for a sphere with\nuniform density \u03c3. M = 1.13 x 1078 proton masses, and it is noted that the Table thereby\nis a confirmation of the entire model, specifically that all universes of the multiverse have\nthe same mass, M.\nTABLE 6.1\nRADII AND SCHWARZSCHILD RADII\n\n========================\nR/RS\nt\n\u03c3\nR(ly)\n----------------------------------------1\n380,000 y\n10-23\n108\n-14\n-6\n18\n10\n10 s\n10\n10-5\n10-40\n0\n1096\n10-31\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe first line applies when the universe's radiation is known from spacecraft\nobservations to escape at t ~ 380,000 years, R/RS = 1. The modeling does not seem\nprecise because standard theories predict the density to be ~10-19 kg m-3 at that time, not\n10-23. However, the precision of these predictions is low, and their effect is small because\nif 10-19 would be used in the calibration of RS, the ratios R/RS would still be 10-14, and the\nother one 10-38 instead of 10-40.\nThe second line is for the above t ~ 10-6 s, using proton density of 1018 kg m-3 to derive\nR. Because R/RS = 10-14 is so strongly negative, the warning indicates a black hole.\n\n\f8\nHowever, our universe is not a black hole. Furthermore, for photons to escape at age\n380,000, they must have been generated much earlier; the 380,000 event must have been\nlong in preparation. In the case of the sun, escape takes a million years for a photon\ngenerated at its center. That is physically a different situation, but it may give some\nindication that the spell of 380,000 years being shorter than a million, for a body much\nmore massive than the sun, follows from the fact that its medium was expanding. Indeed,\nthe scattering density decreased rapidly with time, to as low as the above 10-19 kg m-3 at\nage 380,000.\nIn the third line, the Planck density of 1096 kg m-3 is used (as if our universe were ever\nat t = 0 on the Big-Bang clock), for obtaining R and thereby R/RS. With R/RS = 10-40, the\nwarning calls resoundingly for a black hole. However, our universe is not a black hole,\nwhile this time neither photons nor dark energy are available to save the explanation.\n7. SUPPORTING OBSERVATIONS AND CONSIDERATIONS\nHere is the list of observations used thus far in the modeling. With an asterisk * are\nindicated the ones that have not as yet been verified because that can be done only by\nexperts familiar with the data processing of the WMAP observations. On the other hand,\nwith an elevated BB are the three often-quoted proofs of the Big Bang theory, which\nsupport this model just as well because they are for epochs later than t ~ 10-6 s.\n1. The understanding of the inter-universal medium (IUM) is based on extensive\nobservations of the interstellar medium.\n2. The universes photons decay into \"old cold photons\", which are observed by WMAP\nfrom 3,000 K at age 380,000, down to 3 K now.\n3. The discovery of the acceleration of expansion at age ~5 x 109 is essential for this\nmodel; the model could not exist if deceleration had been found, while now the\nexpansion appears to move debris outward into the IUM.\n4. The Chandra equation of Eqs. (1) and (2) has at its foundation the proton and Planck\nmasses, which are observed in terrestrial laboratories.\n5. The quantization factor of 3.3 x 1019 is observed between the masses of our universe\nand its O-stars, and between Planck and proton masses.\n6. The computed mass of our universe yields the equivalent spherical radius of the\nproton, 8.2 x 10-16 m, on the mean of three sets of observations (this brings a special\nconsideration regarding the spread of the precise observations and the shape of the\nproton).\n7. The mass of O-type stars is observed near the computed 29.2 solar masses.\n8. The mass of our universe is close to the critical mass, as it must be in order to have\nsurvived in the multiverse.\n9. That there has to be an evolutionary multiverse rather than a single universe is\nsupported by inorganic evolution and its many observations (Gehrels 2007).\n10. Section 3.1 has about photons, \"their properties are curiously unique as if they\nevolved in the multiverse for the role we see them play\". This is, of course, the case, as it\nis for every property of all surviving components of the multiverse.\n11. The Supply Problem is solved: where did our universe's observed energy equivalent\nto 1021 solar masses come from?\n12. The origin of our finely tuned physics is solved, because the multiverse has the\nmany universes and long times required for finely tuned evolution.\n\n\f9\n13. The First Uniformity Problem: uniformity is observed until third-decimal precision\nin the 3-K background observations by COBE; the temperature of 1.728 K is observed in\nall directions. Here it is understood from the inputs into the IUM from many decaying\nuniverses.\n14. The Second-Order Non-Uniformity Problem: how could the fifth decimal of the\nbackground show appreciable non-uniformity with variations on a scale of galactic\nclustering, observed in the WMAP maps (Spergel et al. 2007)? This is understood\nbecause the galactic-clustering debris was input into the IUM to begin with, and the 1013\nK temperature apparently was not too high to homogenize that mass distribution.\n15. It did not make sense in the case of the old BB universe to ask where all its\nradiations went; but a surrounding multiverse conserves them.\n16. In the multiverse, the old photons cannot stay and pile up - they must be used. And\nthey are used, for there is great need for them, to make the accretion of our ProtoUniverse possible, that is of the equivalent of 1021 solar masses, without collapse into a\nblack hole.\n17. The inertness and energy-seeking properties of the old universes' debris also played\na role to make this possible, keeping the temperature down to 1013 K.\n18. The simple consideration of a small central volume at highest density in a globe\nshows why the percentage of baryons is small, only 4.6%.\n19. The timing of t ~ 10-6 s for the beginning of our baryon universe is from the standard\nmodel of atomic physics as the time of formation of photons and protons, at proton\ndensity 1018 kg m-3.\n20*. The excitement for Inflation Theory came when WMAP confirmed it in part (but\nnot for an infinite inflation), while for the present model that same confirmation might fit\nthe sudden appearance of a 0.6-AU baryonic object, of protons and neutrons at t ~ 10-6 s\n(old clock), t = 0 now.\n21*. The Photon Burst, a huge fireball of 1013 K, may be confirmed by the WMAP\nobservations of a radiation signature with a wider curvature than that of the 3-K radiation.\n22. Following the Photon Burst, if there was one, the re-energized photons were being\nscattered by re-energized and perhaps re-constituted protons, electrons, and neutrons, so\nas not to get out until age 380,000 years \u2013 the appreciation of this time period is based on\nsolar observations.\n23. The observation that at age 380,000 the universe was expanding is basic to\nunderstanding the proto-universe.\n24BB. The expansion of our universe used as a proof for the Big Bang, applies to this\nmodel for t >10-6 s just as well.\n25BB. The same applies to the 3-K cosmic background.\n26BB. The same applies to the successful prediction of the hydrogen-to-helium ratio.\n27. The Schwarzschild test confirms this model; the test's basic observation is that our\nuniverse is not a black hole.\n28. The dark energy appears from WMAP observations to have been used up by age\n380,000.\n29. Dark energy is observed as old photons.\n30. Dark matter is observed as old cold protons and other particles such as neutrons and\nelectrons as part of our universe's decay debris, as are whole galaxies (each\n\n\f10\ngravitationally holding its debris), clusters of galaxies, and whatever other debris such as\nold stars; the ensemble is referred to as \"protons etc.\"\n8. RESULTS AND FUTURE WORK\nWhenever I learned of a new observation, it always fit into the model, and this seems\nan indication of its truth, as does its aesthetics (Chandrasekhar 1987). With so many\nobservations in support \u2013 a rare case in this discipline \u2013 the model should be close to the\ncosmos' truth, and this is seen in the following 19 examples.\nThe theory is however only approximate, and the points therefore also indicate future\nwork. For example, a numerical modeling of the above scenarios would be of the greatest\ninterest, even though it is already noted with Table 6.1 that it is a confirmation of the\nentire model, and shows the same mass for all universes in the multiverse.\n\u2022 There was strict application of an equation, without anthropic assumptions. The results\nof the model indicate that observations do not affect quantum theory for the macrocosmos.\n\u2022 The quantization of our universe is demonstrated, and extended into the multiverse, as it\nis based on proton and Planck masses.\n\u2022 The M(\u03b1) equation is connected to the Planck domain and is recognized as a universal\nPlanck mass.\n\u2022 The M(\u03b1) equation uses quantum, relativity, gravity, and atomic physics together in a\nunified manner, as its derivation shows (Chandrasekhar 1951).\n\u2022 This is a specific multiverse model, namely a hierarchy of universes that have the same\nmass and physics, based on the M(\u03b1) equation.\n\u2022 The model provides a history for the beginning and ending of our universe.\n\u2022 It uniquely and specifically overcomes the Schwarzschild warnings regarding the reality\nof the early phases of Big-Bang models.\n\u2022\u2022\u2022 The Horizon Problem, Flatness Problem, and Supply Problem are presently solved by\nan ad hoc inflation (Padmanabhan 2002), while in the specific multiverse they are\nnaturally solved by the accretion of debris from many universes for our proto-universe.\n\u2022 The deviations from uniformity at higher than second-decimal precision of the Cosmic\nMicrowave Background follow naturally from the conservation of clustering of galaxy\nmasses throughout the procedures of decay, accretion, and universe formation.\n\u2022 The model brings up the origin of our physics in the multiverse.\n\u2022 The cosmological foundation of our world and its physics is in trial-and-error evolution\nwithin its hierarchy of universes.\n\u2022 The multiverse evolution found the cosmos' h, c, G, H physics.\n\u2022 The modeling found a logical origin for our universe, based on observations, that does\nnot invoke a mysterious point in time called the Big Bang.\n\u2022 The classical wondering why the baryons have only 4.6% of the composition follows\nreadily from spherical geometry of our proto-universe.\n\u2022 The treatment of this paper indicates that the Planck constant is h, not \u0127 = h/2\u03c0, or the O\nstars and universe masses would be unacceptable; a better name for \u0127 may be the Dirac\nconstant.\n\u2022 It also implies that the cosmological constants h, c, G, and H are constant with time and\nlocation.\n\n\f11\n\u2022 Fred Hoyle's fine-tuning of the nuclear transitions within stars is explained by the trialand-error evolution within the multiverse, over 1030 years and 1019 sample universes,\nproducing finely tuned universes to begin with.\n\u2022 Because the universes begin at ~ 10-6 secs instead of t = 0, all problems of the earliest\nBig Bang are avoided.\n9. CONCLUSIONS\nA universe generates many photons and old cold photons, and WMAP observes the\nlatter at 3000 and 3 K. The accelerated expansion brings the debris of our decaying\nuniverse into the Chandra Multiverse, where they are conserved cold for long times.\nEventually, there is formation for the cloud that would become our proto-universe; it\nhas the old photons still at high percentage of the total composition, ~72%. The\nacceleration property of the photons diminishes the effect of gravity through multiple\nscattering on the other components; the radiation property increases because of the rising\ntemperature. When proton density is reached in a central volume, there may be a Photon\nBurst explosion; the old protons are re-configured and they increase the multiple\nscattering of the photons. That central volume apparently has 6.4% of the volume, i.e.,\nour baryon percentage; the explosion may be the one observed by spacecraft as a\nradiation signature with a wider curvature than that of the 3-K radiation. Outside of the\n\"6.4% volume\", the old photons and protons, etc. continue their multiple scattering,\nwhich sustains the expansion.\nThe scenario is played twice, with photons and with what is known about dark energy,\nand the results are identical and even complementing. Dark energy is therefore a name\nfor the acceleration energy of photons. The statistical confirmation of this explanation is\nthat the photons from all old universes cannot have stayed in the multiverse, or our\nmultiverse would not be as we know it today. We would not have been here; we\nourselves are the supporting observation for the conclusions.\nREFERENCES\nChandrasekhar, S., 1937.
