The results of the observations have shown that it is possible to detect line profiles of circumstellar CO from late-type\nstars both within and in the direction of the Galactic bulge.

Introduction\nRapid stellar mass loss occurs at the so-called red giant and,\nin particular, the asymptotic giant branches (RGB and AGB).\nDue to high stellar density and rapid star formation, the Galactic\nbulge contains large numbers of RGB and AGB stars. It is important to measure the mass-loss rates of these stars for a picture\nof the recirculation of matter and metal enrichment in this region of the Milky Way. In addition, stars in the central bulge are\nat distances that differ from one another by merely a few percent\nleading to an accurate estimate of the mass-loss-rate distribution.\nThe most accurate method of estimating the stellar mass-loss rates is based on the CO rotational spectral lines (cf. Ramstedt et al., 2008). The first attempt\nto detect such circumstellar lines in the vicinity of the\nGalactic centre (GC) was made by Mauersberger et al.\n(1988) using the IRAM 30-m telescope. They detected the\nJ=1\u21920 and 2\u21921 CO lines from the proto-planetary nebula (PPN) OH0.9+1.3 which has a high radial velocity\n(\u2013110 km s\u22121 ) making it likely to be physically close to the\nGC. They also proposed to look for CO emission from OH/IR\nstars, since such stars are believed to be the progenitors of PPNe.\nWinnberg et al. (1991) used the same radio telescope to observe\nSend offprint requests to: A. Winnberg\n\nseveral OH/IR stars close to the GC but detected CO emission\nfrom only one star: OH0.3\u20130.2 (Baud et al., 1975). This star\nhas a very high radial velocity (\u2013341 km s\u22121 ) and therefore the\ncircumstellar emission is not affected by the interstellar background emission that covers typically the velocity range \u2013200 to\n+200 km s\u22121 . None of the other candidate stars were detected\nbecause of confusion with interstellar emission.\nThe present project employs a different observing technique\nin an attempt to detect the circumstellar CO emission in the midst\nof interstellar CO emission. A radio interferometer with suitable\nbaselines can be used as a 'spatial filter' by resolving most of the\ninterstellar background but leaving the circumstellar emission as\nunresolved point sources.\nTo determine optimal baseline lengths and the most\nfavourable CO lines, we started a pilot experiment. We chose\nthree OH/IR stars close to the position of the GC with strong\nIR fluxes and with low-to-moderate radial velocities. In 2003\n\u2013 2004 we used the Nobeyama Millimeter Array (NMA) at\n115 GHz (CO, J=1\u21920) and in 2005 we used the SubMillimeter\nArray (SMA; Mauna Kea, Hawaii) at 230 GHz (J=2\u21921).\nThis research note presents the main results of these two data\nsets and outlines the prospects for future systematic surveys of\nlate-type stars in the Galactic bulge using the Atacama Large\n\n\f2\n\nA.

The arrows indicate the velocities of OH masers.\n\n(ISO). A clear signal was obtained from OH359.971\u20130.119 (Fig.\n3, dotted line). The position of the CO line agreed with the position of the 1612-MHz OH line. However, the line width was\ntoo narrow for an unresolved circumstellar CO source and the\nradial velocity of the line was close to that of the red-shifted OH\nline component rather than to the average velocity of the two OH\ncomponents.\nData were taken using two digital correlation spectrometers\nsimultaneously. One of them consisted of 128 channels with a\nwidth of 8.0 MHz. The other one had 1024 channels of width\n31.25 kHz.\nIn June 2005 the same three stars plus the previously detected star OH0.3\u20130.2 were observed using the 8-element array\n(SMA) on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, at 230 GHz. The spectrometer was configured to give a resolution of 3.25 MHz. The test\nstar OH0.3\u20130.2 was detected and showed properties in accordance with the single-dish data (Fig. 1). In addition the stars\nOH359.762+0.120 and OH359.971\u20130.119 were detected (Figs\n2 and 3).\nTypical synthesized beam FWHM values of images produced with all baselines were 4\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 7\u2032\u2032 for the NMA and 3\u2032\u2032 \u00d7\n4\u2032\u2032 for the SMA.\n\n3.

The thick 'staircase' line is the observed\nspectrum with baseline lengths shorter than 25 k\u03bb excluded.\nThe parabola, the residuals and the OH maser velocities are\nrepresented as in Fig. 1. In addition, a thin 'staircase' line\nindicates an observed spectrum with all projected baseline\nlengths included.\n\nThe data were calibrated using the Nobeyama internal programme package and subsequently the Astronomical Image\nProcessing System (AIPS) was used in a standard way to obtain\nimages and spectra.\nWe found strong ripples in the images that could be eliminated by removing data from projected baselines shorter than\n10 k\u03bb (26 m). Due to atmospheric phase instability, we decided\nto remove all projected baselines longer than 40 k\u03bb (104 m) and\nto introduce a gaussian baseline-length taper such that baselines\nof length 40 k\u03bb got a weight of 30 %.\nMaps were made with 256 \u00d7 256 pixels of size 0.5\u2032\u2032 with\nuniform weighting. They were 'cleaned' using the standard\nH\u00f6gbom/Clark algorithm with a gain of 0.1 and a minimum flux\ndensity per clean component being the product of the beam dynamic range (1/|strongest sidelobe|) and the expected rms noise\nfluctuations. This ensured that no 'overcleaning' took place in\nthe rather noisy maps.\nData cubes were made consisting of images from the 20\ncentral channels of the low-resolution spectrometer covering\n416 km s\u22121 . For the high-resolution spectrometer similar data\ncubes were made consisting of 256 channels where each channel resulted from averaging 4 original channels. Therefore these\nspectra covered 83.2 km s\u22121 with a resolution of 0.325 km s\u22121 .\n3.2. The SMA\n\n2. Observations\nThe first observations in this project were done with the 6element array (NMA) at Nobeyama Radio Observatory, Japan, in\nNovember 2003 and in January 2004 at 115 GHz. Three OH/IR\nstars were selected for observations on the basis of strong IR\nfluxes: OH359.117\u20130.169, OH359.762+0.120 and OH359.971\u2013\n0.119 (Ortiz et al., 2002). The relevant data for these stars are\nlisted in Table 1, where F[15] denotes the flux density at a wavelength of 15 \u03bcm as measured by the Infrared Space Observatory\n\nData from this instrument were retrieved using software from\nthe Radio Telescope Data Center (RTDC) of the Center for\nAstrophysics (CfA). Calibration was performed using the image processing package IDL-MIR at Academia Sinica Institute\nof Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA). Further data reduction was made using both AIPS at Onsala Space Observatory\n(OSO) and Miriad (SMA version) at ASIAA.\nThe uv data were investigated for the presence of spatially extended emission by plotting the visibility amplitude\nas a function of projected baseline length. Based on such\nplots it was decided to exclude baselines shorter than 25 k\u03bb\n\n\fA. Winnberg et al.: CO in OH/IR stars at the Galactic centre (RN)\n\n3\n\nTable 1.

For\nOH359.117\u20130.169 no evidence of significant interstellar emission was found. No interstellar emission was found in the IF\nband of the test source OH0.3\u20130.2 as expected.\nMap-cubes were made with 256 \u00d7 256 pixels of size 0.5\u2032\u2032 ,\nhowever, this time with natural weighting. They were 'cleaned'\nusing the standard H\u00f6gbom/Clark algorithm in a manner similar\nto the treatment of the NMA data. When a compact source was\nseen in one of the channels within the OH velocity span at a\nposition close to the position of the OH source, we fitted a twodimensional elliptical Gaussian and extracted a spectrum at the\npixel closest to this position.\nAfter exclusion of the shorter baseline lengths all the maps\nare free from interstellar CO emission except for occasional\npoint sources. We interpret them as unresolved rests of interstellar emission. Since most of the emission is resolved there\nare 'negative point sources' as well, i.e. unresolved 'dips' in the\ninterstellar background. The positions of the OH/IR stars are\nknown to 1\u2032\u2032 or better, and therefore there is never any doubt\nabout the identification of a circumstellar CO source. In addition\nto the position evidence, there is the radial velocity evidence that\nstrengthens the identification case quite considerably.\n\n4.

Circumstellar CO(2\u21921) line profiles of OH359.971\u2013\n0.119. The definitions of the lines are given in the caption of Fig.\n2, except in this figure the dotted 'staircase' line is the CO(1\u21920)\nspectrum as observed with the NMA.\n\nwhere S m is the maximum flux density at the radial velocity\nVm , and Ve is half the line width at zero intensity. These three\nparameters are given in the table together with the statistical\nerrors from the fitting procedure. No CO emission associated\nwith OH359.117\u20130.169 (1\u21920 and 2\u21921) and OH359.762+0.120\n(1\u21920) was found and 3-\u03c3 upper limits are given for S m . The CO\nline profiles for OH359.971\u20130.119 (1\u21920 and 2\u21921) are incompatible with a parabola, although the CO positions are coincident\nwith the OH position, and only approximate values of the maximum flux densities are given (Fig. 3).\nOH359.117\u20130.169 was not detected at any of the two CO\nlines and we do not know the reason for it. One guess would be\nthat this is due to heavy absorption by interstellar CO clouds in\nfront of the star. Such a case could possibly occur for a star that\nis situated at a distance beyond the GC.\n\n\f4\n\nA. Winnberg et al.: CO in OH/IR stars at the Galactic centre (RN)\n\nOH359.762+0.120 was detected with a rather poor S/N.\nTherefore there are quite large errors associated with the elements of the fitted parabola (Fig. 2 and Table 2). Within these\nerrors, the mean radial velocity of the line and the line width are\ncompatible with the systemic velocity of the star and its envelope expansion velocity as measured from the OH line profile.\nNotice that the exclusion of short baselines did not improve the\ndetection of the line significantly. It merely improved the spectral baseline.\nOH359.971\u20130.119 was detected with moderate to good S/N.\nHowever, the CO line is narrow and close to the 'red-shifted'\nOH line component, i.e. the backside of the envelope (Fig. 3).\nA similar, but considerably weaker, line was observed with the\nNMA at 115 GHz (dotted line). Notice that the line profile obtained when all the uv data were included (thin solid line) shows\na much stronger and broader 'red-shifted' line and even a 'blueshifted' counterpart. The 'negative signal' near \u221220 km s\u22121 is\nprobably caused by a 'dip' in the interstellar background, as discussed above, but in this case it is resolved.\nMass-loss rates have been calculated for OH0.3\u20130.2 and\nOH359.762+0.120 (2\u21921) using a new formula based on the\noriginal equation by Knapp & Morris (1985) but containing\nconstants determined by least-squares fits to physical models\n(Ramstedt et al., 2008), and the values have been entered in\nTable 2. For these calculations a distance of 8 kpc to the GC\n(Reid, 1993) and a CO/H2 abundance ratio of 2\u00d710\u22124 (Ramstedt\net al., 2008) have been assumed for both stars. The values of Ve\nhave been taken as the expansion velocities of the CSEs. Both\nmass-loss rates are normal for OH/IR stars (we caution that the\nvalidity of the Ramstedt et al. formula has only been tested in\nthe mass-loss-rate range 10\u22127 to 10\u22125 M\u2299 yr\u22121 ).\n\ndistance would be only about 1.4 kpc. The IR properties of this\nstar also are such that it is arguable whether it belongs to the\nbulge (cf. Ortiz et al., 2002).\nAnother explanation of the line profile would be that it is\nheavily distorted through strong absorption of interstellar CO\nin front of the source. A third possibility - although improbable - is that the physical conditions in this CSE are such that\nthey favour weak maser action along radial directions (Morris,\n1980). Finally, there remains the (improbable) explanation that\nthe source is an unresolved remnant of interstellar CO emission\nthat happens to be at the same position and radial velocity as\nOH359.971\u20130.119.\nObservations of higher-energy CO lines might be a possible\nway of revealing the true nature of this source. However, given\nthe available data, we favour the first alternative, i.e. that we have\nfound a relatively nearby OH/IR star whose CO envelope is resolved by both arrays used. The salient points that support this\nconclusion are:\n\u2013 There are two CO line components whose positions and radial velocities correspond to those of the OH line components.\n\u2013 The redshifted CO line component grows stronger and the\nblueshifted line component emerges when all baselines (including the short ones) are included in the imaging.\n\u2013 There is a weak line component at 115 GHz whose radial\nvelocity coincides with that of the redshifted 230-GHz component and whose position coincides with that of the OH/IR\nstar.\n\u2013 The 115-GHz line is much weaker than the 230-GHz counterpart which mostly is the case for circumstellar CO lines in\nOH/IR stars especially those with cool CSEs (Heske et al.,\n1990).\n\n5. Discussion\n5.1. OH359.762+0.120\n\n6. Conclusions\n\nThere is little doubt, in spite of the poor S/N, that the detected\nCO source is a true circumstellar source associated with the\nOH/IR star. Because of the high bolometric magnitude of this\nstar and its strong OH emission, some people doubt the association of this star with the Galactic bulge (see discussion by\nBlommaert et al., 1998). However, as pointed out by Blommaert\net al. (1998), the OH radiation is heavily scattered by interstellar free electrons (Frail et al., 1994) making it very likely that it\nresides close to the GC. Our result of a weak CO source leading to a normal mass-loss rate for an assumed distance of 8 kpc\nsupports this conclusion.\n\nOur pilot project has shown that it is possible to detect circumstellar CO envelopes of OH/IR stars close to the GC: out of\nthree stars selected, one was detected at both 115 and 230 GHz\n(OH359.971\u20130.119) and another one was detected at 230 GHz\nonly (OH359.762+0.120). OH359.971\u20130.119 probably does not\nbelong to the Galactic bulge, but this fact is irrelevant for the issue at stake \u2013 this star too would have been hard to detect using\na single-dish telescope.\nWe would have liked to observe the same three stars at\n345 GHz (J=3\u21922) and to try out somewhat longer baselines,\nbut both these requests require excellent atmospheric conditions\nand therefore the competition for observing time is strong.\nWe have no doubt that ALMA will be able to detect a large\nnumber of OH/IR stars in the inner bulge (Olofsson, 2008).\n\n5.2. OH359.971\u20130.119\n\nThis star (as well as OH359.762+0.120) has detected 43-GHz\nSiO emission (Lindqvist et al., 1991). However, the v=2, J=1\u21920\nSiO line is much stronger than its v=1 counterpart. This suggests\na cool dust temperature and a high mass-loss rate (Nakashima &\nDeguchi, 2007).\nThe CO source associated with this star, on the other hand,\nis an enigma. The line profile is similar to that expected from a\nwell-resolved circumstellar envelope where unresolved emission\nis left at the front and back sides (see for example the central CO\nsource in U Cam, Lindqvist et al., 1999). For such a picture to be\ntrue, the star needs to be at a small distance and would not belong\nto the Galactic bulge. For example, assuming that the diameter of\nthe CO envelope is 2 \u00d7 1017 cm (which might be an overestimate\nfor the 2\u21921 transition) and that the angular diameter is 10\u2032\u2032 , the\n\nAcknowledgements.
