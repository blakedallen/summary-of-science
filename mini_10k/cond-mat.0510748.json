It is a Stoner\nenhanced paramagnet, which is characterized by the influence of spin fluctuations on the transport properties\n[1]. Replacements of Ni atoms partially by transition\nmetal elements, like Fe, Mn, Cu in CeNi5 expands the\nlattice and produces the significant changes in the magnetic properties [2, 3]. Even, by substituting with a nontransition metal elements, like Ga in CeNi5 can change\nthe magnetic properties [4]. Recently, Singh et al [5] observed that cubic CeMnNi4 (with lattice parameter of\n6.987 \u00c5, space group 216) is ferromagnetic with a large\nmagnetic moments of 4.95 \u03bcB /Mn atom, which is close to\ninteger moment. Also, this system is found to have a high\ndegree of spin polarization. This makes it potentially important material for spintronics applications, as conduction of electrons in such materials can be manipulated\nby the application of applied magnetic field. The origin\nof such large spin polarization in cubic CeMnNi4 has not\nbeen understood clearly. However, it is possible to understand it by first principles calculations. Moreover, the\nstructural phase transition from hexagonal to cubic was\nobserved in CeMnx Ni5\u2212x at higher concentration of Mn\nin range of x = 0.9 - 2.1 [6]. This indicates the possibility\nof manifestation of hexagonal structure at x = 1. Hence,\nwe embarked upon detailed first principles investigation\nof structural and magnetic properties for the hexagonal\nas well as the cubic phase of CeMnNi4 . In order to understand the magnetic phase transitions, we carried out\ncalculations on various possible magnetic configurations,\nviz. ferro-, ferri-, anti-ferro-, as well as non-magnetic\nphase. Our calculations show that the hexagonal phase\nis lower in energy compared to cubic phase, while the\nmagnetic and structural properties of cubic phase have\nexcellent matching with the experiment [5].\nWe have used ab initio projected augmented wave\nmethod [8] and a plane wave basis set within the spinpolarized density functional theory and the generalized\n\ngradient approximation (GGA) [9] for the exchangecorrelation energy. The pseudopotentials are taken as\nimplemented in the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP) [7] . For the f -band Ce, the semi-core s and\np electrons are also taken as valence. For Mn and Ni,\nthe semi-core 3d and 4s are considered as valence electrons. For representing the Brillouin zone, we use mesh\nof 8x8x8 Monkhorst-Pack k-point for cubic and 8x8x4\nincluding gamma point for hexagonal phase. Results on\nconvergence test of these phases with respect to k-point\nsampling shows them to be sufficient within an accuracy\nof 0.001 eV. The conjugate gradient technique is used\nto optimize the structures without any symmetry constraints. The structures are considered to be converged\nwhen the force on each ion becomes 0.001 eV/\u00c5 or less.\nThis high accuracy is also necessary to differentiate between closely lying magnetic phases. Various magnetic\nphases have been acheived by varying the initial magnetic moments of Mn atoms. We find that the direction\nof moment in Mn atoms is preserved after relaxations.\nThe details of the structural parameter, magnetic moments at equilibrium volume, are given in Table 1. For\nhexagonal phase we have considered a supercell of 1x1x2\ndimensions, having two Mn atom per super-cell this also\nallows us to perform anti-ferromagnetic calculations. The\nionic positions and unit-cell parameters have been relaxed completely. This include optimization of a as well\nas c/a ratio in hexagonal phase. The optimized structure remains the same with a = 4.93 \u00c5 and c/a ratio =0.835.The ground state structure is ferromagnetic\nas shown in the table. The anti-ferromagnetic phase\nlies 14 meV/formula unit higher in energy whereas nonmagnetic phase lies at 0.70 eV/formula unit, clearly\nshowing preference for magnetic phases in CeMnNi4 .\nHowever, we can not expect a higher Tc value.\nCubic phase has an optimized unit-cell of a= 6.99 \u00c5\nand is ferromagnetic, like the hexagonal phase, with a\nmagnetic moment of 4.85 \u03bcB /Mn. These are in good\n\n\f2\nTABLE I: The structural and magnetic properties of cubic\nand hexagonal phases of CeMnNi4 .\nCeMnNi4\nspace group\nlattice parameter\n\ncubic\nF43m\na=6.99 \u00c5\n\nTotal moment (\u03bcB /Mn)\nI (eV/formula unit)\nJ (meV/formula unit)\n\n4.85\n1.67\n47\n\nhexagonal\nP6/mmm\na=4.93 \u00c5\nc/a = 0.835\n3.70\n0.7\n14\n\nagreement with experimental value. Unlike hexagonal\nphase, the anti-ferromagnetic phase lies 47 meV/formula\nunit higher in energy. This value could be translated into\nTc of 148 K which is very close to reported experimental\nvalue [5]. The ferri-magnetic phase with moment of 2.49\n\u03bcB /Mn lies at 34 meV/formula unit, whereas the non\nmagnetic phase lies 1.67 eV/formula unit higher in energy. The Stoner parameter (I) defined as energy difference between non-magnetic and ferro-magnetic phases,\nfor cubic is much higher than the hexagonal phase (Table 1). Similar trend has been observed for J-exchange\nparameter defined as energy difference between ferromagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic phase. These results clearly\nshow that the higher magnetic state is well stabilized in\ncubic phase.\nFigure 2 shows the energy/formula unit vs lattice parameter for cubic and hexagonal phases. For cubic phase\nthe minima for non-magnetic case lies at different unit\ncell parameter than the other magnetic states. This\nshows that at high pressure and / or temperature the\nmagnetic moment of ferromagnetic phase can be completely quenched to a non-magnetic state. However, for\nthe hexagonal phase, we do not observe such phase transition.\nFigure 3 shows the total and partial density of states\nof cubic and hexagonal phases. Both phases are metallic\nwith finite number of states at fermi level. The origin\nof metallicity in both cases are different. In the case\nof cubic phase the metallicity is due to finite number of\nstates coming from the Ni atoms only. However, in the\ncase of hexagonal phase Mn as well as Ni atoms are contributing for the metallicity. Ce f -orbital are unoccupied\n(\u22481eV above the Fermi level) in both cases, and hence\nis not expected to affect the results of our LDA calculations. In cubic phase the up-spin states are completely\noccupied whereas down spin states is occupied with the\nfewer number of states. This also explain the observed\npolarization in Andreev reflection experiment [5]. The\noxidation state of Mn in both cubic and hexagonal phase\nis most likely +2. The local moments on Ce, Mn and Ni\nfor cubic (hexagonal) phase are -0.23 (-0.44), 3.96 (3.04),\nand 0.28 (0.26) \u03bcB , respectively. It shows that the net\nmoment on these systems mainly originates from the Mn\natoms, as expected. In the cubic phase there is possi-\n\nbility to convert it into half metallic phase by artificially\nintroducing the defects or changing the concentrations of\nMn. In that case there is possibility of cubic phase to lie\nlower in energy compare to hexagonal phase. There is finite possibility of 100 percent spin polarization if the spin\nconducts through Ce-Mn channel due to the presence of\nhalf metallicity. Moreover the bond distance between CeMn (3.03 \u00c5) is quite comparable to Ce-Ni (2.90 \u00c5) so the\nchances are more here for this channel to conduct. A detail study on possible ways to convert it into a complete\nhalf metallic phase via artificial means are currently going on and details would be published elsewhere.\nWe have also performed the magnetic phase transition\nstudy on cubic phase by changing the pressure via the\nlattice parameter (Fig. 4). We find that there is no\nphase transitions between any magnetic or non-magnetic\nphases. However, the stoner exchange parameter increases with increasing the lattice parameter (Fig. 4). In\nthe other case the J-exchange parameter decreases with\nthe increasing lattice parameter due to the larger distance between Mn and other atoms, which reduces the\nhybridization [10].\nFurther, we calculate the energy band structure of both\nphases. In the case of cubic phase there are very few\nstates (Fig. 5), which are crossing the fermi level corresponding to up-spin component. As discussed above by\nintroducing some other artificial effects these states could\nbe shifted up (valence band states) and down (conduction\nband states) to transform this system to a half metallic\nstate. However, in the case of hexagonal phase the situation near the fermi energy is more complicated as there\nare too many states crossing the fermi energy. So it may\nbe difficult to transform this hexagonal phase into half\nmetallic state even though this phase is energetically favorable. Transforming the phase to cubic would be one\nof the ways to do so as also the phase transition from\nhexagonal to cubic phase is observed in CeMnx Ni5\u2212x in\nrange of x =0.9 to 2.9.\nIn summary, we study the CeMnNi4 in both hexagonal and cubic phases considering various possible magnetic states. Our results are in very good agreement with\nthe recent transport spectroscopy experiments. We find\nferromagnetic phase to be lowest in energy for both the\nphases. The hexagonal phase lies lower in energy compare to cubic phase by 0.24 eV/formula unit. Both of\nthe phases are metallic, though the density of states and\nband structure shows a higher degree of spin polarization\nin cubic phase. There is a finite possibility of transforming it to half metallic phase by artificial means. This\ncould be a promising material for future spintronics applications.\nThe authors would like to thank the staffs of the Center for Computational Materials Science at IMR for the\nuse of the Hitachi SR8000/64 supercomputing facilities.\nWe would also like to thank Dr. P.
