Operation is demonstrated on single-walled carbon nanotubes, for\nwhich the setup was optimized.\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nRaman spectroscopy is a widespread and important\ntool in various fields of science from biology to physics.\nCommercial Raman spectrometers are usually equipped\nwith a built-in laser and a setup optimized for this single laser line, resulting in stable operation but inherently\nnarrow-band characteristics. The electronic, optical, and\nvibrational characterization of certain materials, such as\nsingle-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs)1 requires measurements with a large number of laser lines2 or with a\ntunable laser system3,4 .\nRaman spectroscopy relies on the efficient suppression\nof \"stray light\" photons with wavelengths close to that of\nthe exciting laser (e.g. from Rayleigh scattering) which\ndominate over the Raman signal by several orders of magnitude. Operation down to Raman shifts of 100 cm\u22121 is\nmade possible in modern spectrometers with the use of\ninterference Rayleigh filters (often referred to as notch\nfilters). The transmission of these filters typically exceeds 80 % for the passband, this is significantly higher\nthan for a classical subtractive double monochromator\nsystem. Although interference filters are manufactured\nfor the most common laser lines only, rotation extends\nthe range of filter operation. Thus the narrow-band constraint could be circumvented to allow broadband operation. However in most spectrometers, the interference\nfilter has a dual role: it reflects the laser light to the\nsample and it functions as a Rayleigh filter. Filter rotation changes the optical path of the excitation that can\nbe corrected for with tedious and time consuming readjustment only, effectively nullifying the advantage of the\nhigher sensitivity.\nIn particular for the radial breathing mode of SWCNTs, the presence of the low energy (\u2265 100 \u2212 150 cm\u22121 )5\nRaman modes and the narrow (FWHM \u223c 30 meV) optical transition energies3 pose several challenges to the instrumentation. A proper energy dependent Raman measurement requires a broadband spectrometer with effi-\n\ncient stray light rejection.\nHerein, we describe the modification of a commercial\nRaman spectrometer with interference Rayleigh filters,\nwhich enable broadband operation with relative ease.\nThe improvement is based on replacing the built-in interference filter with a beam splitter and a separate interference filter. Thus the two functions of the filter are\nperformed independently with no observable on influence\nthe direction of the transmitted light. The different behavior of the filter passband for the S and P 6 polarizations under rotation is overcome by the application of\npolarization filters on the spectrometer input. The setup\noperates with polarizations which are optimized when\nthe so-called antenna effect of SWCNTs is taken into\naccount, i.e. that the Raman light is polarized predominantly along the polarization of the excitation7,8 .\n\nII.\n\nSPECTROMETER SETUP\n\nA high sensitivity, confocal single monochromator Raman system with a interference Rayleigh filter-such as\ndescribed in the previous section-can be modified to enable broadband measurements with multiple laser lines\nor even with a tunable laser, which we demonstrate for a\nLabRAM commercial spectrometer (Horiba Jobin-Yvon\nInc.) as an example. The key step in achieving the broadband operation was replacing the built-in interference filter, which acts as a beam splitter and a Rayleigh filter\nat the same time, with a combination of a simple beam\nsplitter and a serarate interference filter. We note herein\nthat this modification also enables a cost effective operation with usual laser wavelengths (such as e.g. the\nlines of an Ar/Kr laser) since no complicated filter realignments are required. We have to emphasize that the\nuse of standard optical elements, which are non-specific\nto the spectrometer allows economic implementation for\nmost spectrometer designs.\nThe setup for the modified LabRAM spectrometer is\n\n\f2\n\nshown in Fig. 1. A multiline Ar/Kr laser (Coherent Inc.,\nInnova C70C-Spectrum) and a dye laser (Coherent Inc.,\nCR-590) pumped by a 532 nm 5 W solid state laser (Coherent Inc., Verdi G5) serve as excitation light sources.\nThe former operates at multiple, well defined wavelengths\nwhile the latter allows fully tunable application. In our\ncase, the dye laser is operated in the 545-580 nm, 580610 nm, and 610-660 nm wavelength ranges with three\ndyes: Rhodamin 110, Rhodamin 6G, and DCM Special,\nrespectively. The periscope allows beam alignment and\nsets the polarization of the excitation light to horizontal.\nIn the case of the dye laser, the spurious fluorescent\nbackground of the laser output is filtered with short pass\n(\"3rd Millennium filters\" for 580 and 610 nm from Omega\nOptical Inc.) and band pass (\"RazorEdge\" for 568, 633,\nand 647 nm from Semrock Inc.) filters. For the cleanup of the multiline laser excitation band pass filters are\nused at the appropriate wavelengths (\"RazorEdge\" for\n458, 488, 515, 532, 568, 633, and 647 nm from Semrock Inc.) The light is directed toward the sample with\na broadband beam splitter plate (Edmund Optics Inc.,\nNT47-240) with 30 % reflection and 70 % transmission.\nFor both excitation sources a single, long pass interference edge filter (\"RazorEdge\" for 458, 488, 515, 532, 568,\n633, and 647 nm from Semrock Inc.) performs stray light\nrejection. The use of a short pass filter for laser cleanup and long pass filters for Rayleigh photon supression\nlimits operation for the Stokes Raman range.\nThe long pass filter has double function in the original spectrometer: it mirrors the laser excitation to the\n\n1500\n1000\nCounts (arb.u.)\n\nFIG. 1. Schematic diagram of the broadband configuration\nof the LabRAM spectrometer. V and H denote vertical and\nhorizontal polarizations, respectively. The tunable source is\na dye laser pumped with a 532 nm solid state laser. The\nlaser light is aligned with the spectrometer using the periscope\nelement, which also rotates the polarization to horizontal, if\nneeded. The laser outputs are cleaned with a filter. The\nsample emits a nominally horizontally polarized light and the\nunwanted vertical polarization is filtered with the polarizer.\n\nsample and acts as a Rayleigh filter, quenching the stray\nlight. In our construction, these two tasks are performed\nindependently by a beam splitter and a long pass filter,\nrespectively. The broadband beam splitter plate has 30\n% reflection and 70 % transmission, thus only a small\nfraction of the Raman light is lost. The 70 % excitation power loss on the beam splitter can be compensated\nby reducing the attenuation of the intensive laser beam,\nmaintaining a constant irradiation density on the sample.\nThe application of an anti-reflective coating to the back\nside of the plate prohibited the emergence of higher order reflections and standing waves (whose effect is known\nas ghosts) within the plate. The beam splitter plate is\nmounted on a finely adjustable 2-axis holder (Thorlabs\nInc., VM1) with a home made mounting. The fine adjustment is required to set the light alignment properly with\nthe spectrometer. Final fine adjustment is performed\nwith the holder to maximize the Raman signal.\n\n500\n0\n1000\n500\n0\n\na.)\n\n=0\n\no\n\nb.)\n\n=30\n\no\n\n15500\n\n16000\n\n16500\n\n17000\n\n-1\n\nW avenumber (cm )\n\nFIG. 2. Transmittance of the 633 nm long pass filter using unpolarized white light; a.) at normal incidence and b.) rotated\nby 30\u25e6 . When polarization filters are used, the two parts of\nthe double step feature (solid black line) are separated according to the S- and P -polarization (dashed black and solid gray\nlines, respectively). Note the broadening of filter transition\nwidth upon rotation.\n\nIncreasing the incidence angle of the light changes the\nrange of filter operation of the interference filters without the misalignment of the light. Thus filter rotation\nenables broadband operation. In Fig. 2., we show the\nbehavior of a 633 nm long pass filter at different incidence angles. The edge of transmission blue shifts upon\nrotation with respect to normal incidence. However, the\nshift is smaller for the S than for the P polarization;\ni.e. the shift is larger for the horizontally polarized light\nwhen the filter is rotated around a vertical axis. Vertical\nrotation of the long pass filter is more practical, meaning that the setup prefers horizontally polarized scattered\n(Raman) light as it is of the P polarization, for which the\nedge shift is larger. For 1 inch apertures short and long\npass filters rotation angles up to 30\u25e6 were used, yielding\na blue shift of about 10 %; the 0.5 inch aperture of band\npass \"Razor edge\" filters limited the blue shift to about 5\n%. The width of the filter transition edge also broadens\n\n\f7,7\n\n9,3\n\nA\n\n(arb. u.)\n\n2.25\n\n100\n\n9,6\n8,8\n\n9,2\n\n10,4\n\n10\n11,2\n\n2.20\n1\n\nTEST MEASUREMENTS\n\nTest measurements of the broadband setup were carried out with the tunable dye laser on a HiPCO SWCNT\nsample (Carbon Nanotechnologies Inc., Houston, Texas),\nsuspended in a 2 weight% solution of SDBS (Sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate) and water using sonication.\nWe focused on the radial breathing mode (RBM)\nRaman range located below 400 cm\u22121 , which is commonly studied to characterize the diameter distribution\nin SWCNTs9 . Carbon-tetrachloride was used for Raman\nshift correction and Raman intensity normalization such\nas in Ref.3 . The suspended HiPCO sample was placed\nin a glass cuvette under the objective of the built-in\nmicroscope (Olympus LMPlan 50x/0.50, inf./0/NN26.5,\n\u223c 1 \u00d7 1 \u03bcm2 spot size) and the CCl4 reference sample\nwas placed into the macro cuvette holder. The LabRAM\nspectrometer allows to change between a macro and micro mode with a mirror resulting in stable and robust\nspectral shift calibration and intensity normalization as\nthere is no need for further adjustments nor for sample\nexchange.\nLaser excitation energies between 1.92 eV (648 nm)\nand 2.27 eV (545 nm) were covered with an energy resolution of about 12 meV (\u223c 100 cm\u22121 ). The spectrometer\nwas operated with a 600 grooves/mm grating and a liquid\nnitrogen cooled CCD with 1024 pixels along the spectral\ndirection. This configuration yields a \u223c 1.3 cm\u22121 Raman shift resolution and \u223c 1800 cm\u22121 spectral range for\n600 nm (both are wavelength dependent). Typical laser\npowers of 1-5 mW were used with no observable heating\neffects, due to the liquid nature of both samples.\nAn approximately 8 minute long measurement cycle\nconsists of changing the dye laser wavelength, rotating\nof the laser clean-up and the long pass filters to the\nappropriate positions, shifting the spectrometer grating,\nnulling the spectrometer. Typical measurement times of\n4 minutes for the sample and a few seconds for the reference yield an acceptable signal to noise ratio of about\n\n6,5\n\n12,0\n\n2.15\n8,4\n\n6,4\n\n2.10\n10,7\n11,5\n\n2.05\n\n9,9\n\n12,3\n\n11,1\n\n13,1\n\n2.00\n\n1.95\n\n150\n\nB\n\n10,3\n13,4\n14,2\n\n7,6\n\n11,8\n200\n15,0\n\n250\n\n7,5\n\n300\n\n350\n\n-1\n\nRaman shift (cm )\n9,5\n\nIII.\n\nRaman\nintensity\n\nLaser energy (eV)\n\nfor larger incidence angles. This is defined as the maximum difference between the laser wavelength at which\nthe attenuation exceeds optical density 6 and the filter\nedge-wavelength at the 50 % transmission point. For the\n30\u25e6 incidence, a fivefold increase in the transition width\nis observed when compared to the normal incidence, allowing operation down to 70 \u2212 140 cm\u22121 .\nFor SWCNTs, the Raman light is polarized preferentially along the polarization of the excitation, this is\ndue to a phenomenon called the antenna effect7,8 . We\nalso verified that the LabRAM spectrometer itself is\nnot polarization-sensitive in contrast to an older triple\nmonochromator system. Therefore a horizontally polarized laser excitation is preferred which explains the polarizations used in our design. The less shifted S (in our\nconstruction vertically) polarized stray light is removed\nwith a polarization filter before the spectrometer input.\n\n3\n\n8,5\n\n8,3\n\nFIG. 3.

The sample and reference measurements followed\neach other immediately without moving the grating position, which led to an accurate Raman shift measurement.\nAdditional time is needed for the filter exchange (a few\nminutes) and to change the laser dye and to readjust\nthe beam alignment (about 1 hour). We note that once\nthe dye laser is set and the light path is properly aligned\nwith the spectrometer, no further realignment is required\nwhen the wavelength is changed, even though the filters\nare rotated and the optical path is only minutely modified.\nIn total, 9 hours were required to complete the energy dependent Raman experiments with the 29 laser\nlines including 2 laser dye exchanges. Measurements of a\nsimilar scale such as published previously using a triple\nmonochromator spectrometer10 last for about 2 weeks,\nmainly due to the approximately 50 times smaller S/N\nratio and the need for a spectrometer realignment upon\nwavelength change.\nRaman shift correction, intensity normalization, and\nthe Raman map preparation was performed using a\nhome-made software. Linear baseline correction was sufficient since no fluorescent response was encountered. Raman shift was corrected for with the carbon-tetrachloride\nRaman modes at 218 and 314 cm\u22121 . Intensity normalization using CCl4 is required as it accounts for instrumental uncertainties such as a slight misalignment of\nthe scattered light upon dye exchange. We checked the\nconsistency of the normalization by measuring the same\n\n\f4\nwavelength with different laser dyes after spectrometer\nrealignment.\nFig. 3. shows the 2D contour plot of the Raman map,\ncompiled from spectra such as shown in Fig. 3.A. The\nnormalized Raman intensity is displayed on a logarithmic scale. A good agreement is observed between our\ndata and the measurements in Ref.3 , whose resonance\ntransition energies and Raman shifts are shown for the\ndifferent SWCNT chiral indexes, (n, m), with full circles.\nWe do not observe the (8,4) SWCNT in our measurement, due the low intensity of the resonant Raman process species11 . Points corresponding to the same SWCNT\nfamilies, i.e. when 2n + m is constant9 , are connected by\nsolid lines.\nVertical, i.e. energy cross section of the Raman map\nwere obtained by averaging around a given Raman shift.\nRepresentative energy cross section data are shown in\nFig. 3.B, along with fits using the resonance Raman\ntheory3,10 . Fits yield transition energies and quasiparticle scattering rates in good agreement with typical literature values, especially considering that the different\nsolvent environment slightly modifies the Raman transition energies3 . We note that no further corrections were\nmade to obtain the energy cross section data apart from\nthe normalization by the reference. The result is therefore remarkably smooth in comparison with similar data\npublished in Refs.3,4,12 . This is due to the robust and\nreproducible measurement of the reference sample and\npossibility of measuring Raman spectra at different wave-\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nM. Dresselhaus, G.

The improvement allows the use of both multiline and tunable dye lasers. The spectrometer performance is demonstrated on SWCNTs where such broadband measurements are inevitable to obtain meaningful\ninsight into vibrational and electronic properties.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWork supported by the Austrian Science Funds (FWF)\nproject Nr.
