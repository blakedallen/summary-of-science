Introduction\nThis paper is an attempt to understand topological properties of Lie\ngroup actions. Its starting point was the following theorem of McDuff\u2013\nSlimowitz [1] concerning circle subgroups of Symp(M, \u03c9), the group of symplectomorphisms of a symplectic manifold (M, \u03c9). Recall that an effective\ncircle action is semifree if the stabilizer subgroup of each point in M is either the circle itself or the trivial group. Also, we say that a circle subgroup\n\u039b of a topological group H is essential in H if it represents a nonzero\nelement in \u03c01 (H) and inessential in H otherwise.\nTheorem 1.1. Any semifree circle action on a closed symplectic manifold\n(M, \u03c9) is essential in Symp(M, \u03c9).\nThis is obvious if the action is not Hamiltonian since in this case the flux\nhomomorphism\nFlux : \u03c01 (Symp(M, \u03c9)) \u2212\u2192 H 1 (M, R)\nDate: 8 March 2005.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 53C15.\nKey words and phrases.

However, if the action is Hamiltonian with generating\nHamiltonian K : M \u2212\u2192 R then the result is not so easy: the proof in [1]\ninvolved studying the Hofer length of the corresponding paths \u03c6K\nt , t \u2208 [0, T ],\nin Ham(M, \u03c9).\nThe first result in this paper uses the theorem above to answer a question\nposed by Alan Weinstein in [4]. Let G be a semisimple Lie group with Lie\nalgebra g. Let M \u2282 g\u2217 be a coadjoint orbit, together with the Kostant\u2013\nKirillov symplectic form \u03c9. If the coadjoint action of G on M is effective,\nthen G is naturally a subgroup of Ham(M, \u03c9), the group of Hamiltonian\nsymplectomorphisms of (M, \u03c9). This inclusion induces a natural map from\nthe fundamental group of G to the fundamental group of Ham(M, \u03c9). Weinstein asks when this map is injective. We prove that this map is injective\nfor all compact semisimple Lie groups. In [3] Vina established a special case\nof this result by quite different methods.\nTheorem 1.2. Let a compact semisimple Lie group G act effectively on a\ncoadjoint orbit (M, \u03c9). Then the inclusion G \u2212\u2192 Ham(M, \u03c9) induces an\ninjection from \u03c01 (G) to \u03c01 (Ham(M, \u03c9)).\nIn view of Theorem 1.1, this is an immediate consequence of the following\nresult, which we prove in Section 2.\nProposition 1.3. Let a compact semisimple Lie group G act effectively on\na coadjoint orbit (M, \u03c9). Then every nontrivial element in \u03c01 (G) may be\nrepresented by a circle that acts semifreely on M .\nTheorem 1.1 immediately implies that if a compact Lie group G acts\neffectively on a closed symplectic manifold (M, \u03c9), then any semifree circle\nsubgroup \u039b \u2282 G is essential in G. The other results in the paper generalize\nthis claim.\nObserve that Theorem 1.1 does not immediately extend to the smooth\n(non-symplectic) category. For example, Claude LeBrun pointed out to\nus that the circle action on S 4 induced by the diagonal action of S 1 on\nC2 = R4 \u2282 R5 is semifree but gives a nullhomotopic loop since \u03c01 (SO(5)) =\nZ/2Z. Nevertheless, the semifree condition does have consequences in the\nsmooth category, even if the action is only semifree on a neighborhood of\na component of the fixed point set; we shall say that such components are\nsemifree. Further, given a circle subgroup \u039b \u2282 G we say that g \u2208 G\nreverses \u039b in G if gtg \u22121 = t\u22121 for all t \u2208 \u039b. Finally, a component F of the\nfixed point set M \u039b of \u039b is symmetric in G if there is an element g \u2208 G\nwhose action on M fixes F pointwise and which reverses \u039b.\nTheorem 1.4. Let \u039b be a circle subgroup of a compact Lie group G which\nacts effectively on a connected manifold M . If there is a semifree component\nof the fixed point set M \u039b which is not symmetric in G, then \u039b is essential\nin G.\nExample 1.5. First, let G = SU (2) act on CP2 by the defining representation on the first two copies of C, and let \u039b \u2282 G be the circle subgroup\n\n\fON NEARLY SEMIFREE CIRCLE ACTIONS\n\n3\n\ngiven by \u03bb * [z0 : z1 : z2 ] 7\u2192 [\u03bbz0 : \u03bb\u22121 z1 : z2 ]. This action has a semifree\nfixed point, namely [0, 0, 1]. Moreover, this circle subgroup is inessential in\nG. Therefore, by the theorem above, there exists g \u2208 G which reverses the\ncircle action and fixes [0, 0, 1]. In fact, we can take any g which lies in the\nnormalizer N (\u039b) but not in \u039b itself. Note that g 2 = \u22121l for any such g.\nIn contrast, consider the natural action of G = P U (3) on CP2 , and let\n\u039b \u2282 G be the circle subgroup given by \u03bb * [z0 : z1 : z2 ] 7\u2192 [\u03bb2 z0 : z1 : z2 ].\nThis action is semifree and essential, but is not reversed by any g \u2208 G. To\nsee this, note that the circle has order 3 in \u03c01 (G), whereas every circle that\ncan be reversed has order 1 or 2.\nOne can weaken the semifree hypothesis in the above theorem, at the\ncost of adding a global isotropy assumption and working once more in the\nsymplectic category. We say that a circle action has at most twofold\nisotropy if every point which is not either fixed or free has stabilizer Z/(2).\nRecall, also, that a symplectic action of G on (M, \u03c9) is Hamiltonian if it is\ngiven by an equivariant moment map \u03a6 : M \u2212\u2192 g\u2217 .\nTheorem 1.6. Let \u039b be a circle subgroup of a compact Lie group G which\nacts effectively on a connected symplectic manifold (M, \u03c9). If \u039b has at most\ntwofold isotropy and if there is no g \u2208 G which reverses \u039b, then \u039b is essential\nin G.\nExample 1.7. This theorem does not extend to circle actions which have\nat most threefold isotropy. For example, the action of S 1 on CP3 given by\n\u03bb * [x, y, z, w] = [\u03bb2 x, \u03bb\u22121 y, \u03bb\u22121 z, w] is inessential in P U (4). However, since\nFmax and Fmin are not diffeomorphic, this action has no reversor.\nWe also need the symplectic hypothesis. To see this, consider the obvious\naction of SU (3) on S 6 := C3 \u222a {\u221e}. The subgroup \u039b := diag (\u03bb2 , \u03bb\u22121 , \u03bb\u22121 )\nacts with at most twofold isotropy but has no reversor.\nRemark 1.8. If G is a simple group, we do not need to assume that (M, \u03c9)\nis symplectic in Theorem 1.6; we only need to assume that there exists a\npoint p which is fixed by a maximal torus containing \u039b but is not fixed by\nall of G. Note that, in contrast, in the example above, the only points fixed\nby \u039b are fixed by all of G.\nRemark 1.9. If \u039b is any circle subgroup of SO(3) \u2013 or indeed a subgroup\nof any simple group of type Bn , Cn , or F4 \u2013 then there exists a g \u2208 G which\nreverses \u039b. In this case, Theorem 1.6 is trivial and the force of Theorem 1.4\nis that we can choose g so that it also fixes p.\nRemark 1.10. In the proof of the above theorems, we pick a maximal\ntorus T which contains \u039b. The reversor g that we construct lies in the\nnormalizer N (T ) and has the property that g2 lies in T . However, as we\nsaw in Example 1.5, g2 may not be equal to the identity.\nTheorems 1.4 and 1.6 have the following easy corollaries:\n\n\f4\n\nDUSA MCDUFF AND SUSAN TOLMAN\n\nCorollary 1.11. Consider a Hamiltonian circle action \u039b on a closed symplectic\nmanifold (M, \u03c9) with moment map K : M \u2212\u2192 R, normalized so that\nR\nn = 0.

In particular,\n(a) K(F ) = 0.\n(b) The sum of the weights at F is zero.\nCorollary 1.12.

We make partial progress towards answering this\nquestion in [2].\nAll the results in this paper are proved by a case by case study of the\nstructure of semisimple Lie algebras.\n2. Coadjoint orbits\nIn this section, we prove Proposition 1.3. We begin with a brief review of\na few facts about Lie groups.\nEach simply connected compact semisimple Lie group is a product of\nsimple factors, and its center is the product of the centers of its simple\nfactors. Moreover, since its Lie algebra splits into a corresponding sum,\nthe coadjoint orbits also are products of coadjoint orbits of simple groups.\nTherefore, we may assume that G is simple.\ne denote the universal cover\nLet G be a compact simple Lie group.

Lie Group Actions\nThis section contains proofs of Theorems 1.4 and 1.6. We begin by stating\na lemma about root systems, that is proved at the end. We shall always\nassume that the positive Weyl chamber is closed.\nLemma 3.1. Let G be a simply connected compact simple Lie group. Let t\nbe the Lie algebra of a maximal torus T \u2282 G. Let le be the integral lattice, let\n\u2206 denote the set of roots, and let W denote the Weyl group. Use the Killing\ne Choose a positive Weyl chamber which\nform to identify t and t\u2217 .

Then the following claims\nhold:\n(a) IfP(\u03bb, \u03b4) \u2264 2, then there exist orthogonal roots \u03b71 , . . . , \u03b7k \u2208 \u2206 so that\n\u03bb = ai \u03b7i and so that (\u03bb, \u03b7i ) = ai (\u03b7i , \u03b7i ) = 2 for all i.\n(b) Let L \u2282 \u2206 be a set of roots which contains every root \u03b7 \u2208 \u2206 such that\n\u03b4 + \u03b7 or \u03b4 \u2212 \u03b7 is also a root. Assume also that L is closed under addition,\nthat is, it contains every root which can be written as the sum of roots in L.\nThen L contains all roots.\n\n\fON NEARLY SEMIFREE CIRCLE ACTIONS\n\n7\n\n(c) If (\u03bb, \u03b4) > 2 and \u2212id : t \u2212\u2192 t is not an element of the Weyl group, then\nfor every nonzero weight \u03b1 \u2208 le\u2217 there exists \u03c3 \u2208 W so that |(\u03c3 * \u03b1, \u03bb)| > 1.\n(d) If \u2212id : t \u2212\u2192 t is not an element of the Weyl group, then \u03b4 is the only\nroot which lies in the positive Weyl chamber.\nUsing this result, we can find find elements which reverse certain circle\nsubgroups of simply connected compact simple Lie groups. Note that because G is simply connected, every circle subgroup of G is inessential in\nG.\nLemma 3.2. Let \u039b be a circle subgroup of a simply connected compact\nsimple Lie group G.\n(i) Let \u03c1 : G \u2212\u2192 GL(V ) be a nontrivial representation of G. If \u039b acts\nsemifreely on V then there exists g \u2208 G that reverses \u039b.\n(ii) Let H\nG be a proper subgroup containing \u039b. If the adjoint action of\n\u039b on g/h is semifree, then there exists h \u2208 H that reverses \u039b.\n(iii) Let H\nG be a proper subgroup containing a maximal torus which\ncontains \u039b. If the natural action of \u039b on G/H has at most twofold isotropy,\nthen there exists g \u2208 G that reverses \u039b.\nThe assumption in (ii) above is a special case of (i) since the representation\nV is restricted; however, the conclusion is stronger since it asserts that the\nreversor lies in H. Statement (ii) and (iii) are also related: the former makes\na strong assumption about the action induced by \u039b on the tangent space\nto G/H at the fixed point eH, the latter makes a weaker assumption about\nthe action at all the fixed points on G/H.\nWe will now use the claims in Lemma 3.1 to prove Lemma 3.2. Let T be\na maximal torus which contains \u039b. Let le \u2282 t denote the integral lattice. Let\n\u03bb \u2208 le be the vector corresponding to \u039b. Choose a positive Weyl chamber\nwhich contains \u03bb. Let \u03b4 \u2208 \u2206 denote the highest root.\nRecall that the Weyl group W is the quotient N (T )/T , where N (T ) is\nthe the normalizer of T in G. Every root \u03b7 gives rise to an element w\u03b7 \u2208 W\nwhose action on t\u2217 is given by w\u03b7 (\u03b2) = \u03b2 \u2212 2(\u03b7,\u03b2)\n(\u03b7,\u03b7) \u03b7.\nProof of Lemma 3.2 (i). Let \u03c1 : G \u2212\u2192 GL(V ) be a nontrivial representation of G. Assume that \u039b acts semifreely on V .\nSuppose first that (\u03bb, \u03b4) P\n\u2264 2. By claim (a), there exist orthogonal roots\n\u03b71 , . . . , \u03b7k \u2208 \u2206 so that \u03bb =\nai \u03b7i . Since the roots are orthogonal, for each\n\u03b7i the associated element of the Weyl group w\u03b7i takes \u03b7i to \u2212\u03b7i and leaves\n\u03b7j fixed for all j 6= i. Hence, their product w = w\u03b71 * * * w\u03b7n takes \u03bb to \u2212\u03bb,\nand so reverses \u039b.\nSo assume instead that (\u03bb, \u03b4) > 2. If \u2212id is in the Weyl group, then\nstatement (i) is trivial. So we assume that it is not. Let T act on V via\nrestriction, and pick any nonzero weight \u03b1 \u2208 le\u2217 in the weight decomposition.\nBy claim (c), we can find some \u03c3 \u2208 W such that |(\u03c3 * \u03b1, \u03bb)| > 1. Since \u03c3 * \u03b1\n\n\f8\n\nDUSA MCDUFF AND SUSAN TOLMAN\n\nalso appears in the weight decomposition, this contradicts the assumption\nthat the action of \u039b on V is semifree.\n\u2737\nProof of Lemma 3.2 (ii). Let H \u2286 G be a proper subgroup which contains\n\u039b. Assume that the adjoint action of \u039b on g/h is semifree. Let L be the\nset of roots \u03b7 \u2208 \u2206 so that the associated weight space E\u03b7 \u2282 gC lies in hC .\nClearly, if |(\u03b7, \u03bb)| > 1, then \u03b7 \u2208 L.\nSuppose first that (\u03bb, \u03b4) P\n\u2264 2. By claim (a), there exist orthogonal roots\n\u03b71 , . . . , \u03b7k \u2208 \u2206 so that \u03bb =\nai \u03b7i and so that (\u03bb, \u03b7i ) = 2 for every i. Since\n(\u03b7i , \u03bb) = 2, \u03b7i lies in L for all i. Hence, the associated element of the Weyl\ngroup w\u03b7i lies in H for all i. Thus w = w\u03b71 * * * w\u03b7k must lie in H.\nSo assume instead that (\u03bb, \u03b4) > 2. We see immediately that \u03b4 and \u2212\u03b4 lie\nin L. If \u03b7, \u03b7 \u2032 and \u03b7 + \u03b7 \u2032 are all roots, then [E\u03b7 , E\u03b7\u2032 ] = E\u03b7+\u03b7\u2032 . Hence, since\nhC is closed under Lie bracket, if \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 are in L then \u03b7 + \u03b7 \u2032 \u2208 L also,\nthat is, L is closed under addition. Additionally, if \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 are roots such\nthat \u03b4 = \u03b7 + \u03b7 \u2032 , then either (\u03bb, \u03b7) > 1 or (\u03bb, \u03b7 \u2032 ) > 1. If the former holds,\nthen \u03b7 and \u2212\u03b7 lie in L. Since L is closed under addition, so do \u03b7 \u2032 and \u2212\u03b7 \u2032 .\nThe other case is identical. Thus, claim (b) implies that every root lies in\nL. This contradicts the claim that H is a proper subgroup.\n\u2737\nProof of Lemma 3.2 (iii). Let H ( G be a proper subgroup which\ncontains the maximal torus T , and assume that the natural action of \u039b \u2282 T\non G/H has at most twofold isotropy.\nIf (\u03bb, \u03b4) \u2264 2, then part (iii) follows by the argument used to prove part\n(i). So assume that (\u03bb, \u03b4) > 2. We may also assume that \u2212id does not lie\nin the Weyl group, because otherwise the claim is trivial. Since H \u2282 G is\nproper, there exists at least one root \u03b7 so that the associated weight space\nE\u03b7 is not contained in hC . Then there is \u03c3 \u2208 W so that the root \u03c3 * \u03b7 lies in\nthe positive Weyl chamber. Hence by (d) \u03c3 * \u03b7 = \u03b4, and so |(\u03c3 * \u03b7, \u03bb)| > 2.\nChoose \u03c3\u0303 \u2208 N (T ) which descends to \u03c3. Then \u03c3\u0303H is a fixed point for T , and\n\u03c3 * \u03b7 is one of the weights for \u039b at this fixed point. This contradicts the fact\nthat the action has at most twofold isotropy.\n\u2737\nWe are now ready to deduce Theorems 1.4 and 1.6. In both cases, we will\ndo this by proving the contrapositive, that is, we will assume that \u039b is an\ninessential circle subgroup and use this to construct a reversor.\ne denote the universal cover of G. Then G\ne is the direct product of a\nLet G\ncompact simply connected semisimple Lie group and a vector space. Since\ne Since this lift must lie in\n\u039b is inessential, it lifts to a circle subgroup of G.\ne\ne is\nthe compact part of G, we may assume without loss of generality that G\na compact simply connected semisimple Lie group.\nIn fact, it is enough to prove these claims for the universal cover of G,\nas long as we no longer insist on an effective action but instead allow a\nfinite number of elements of the group to act trivially on M . Thus we\nmay assume that G is the product of compact simple and simply connected\n\n\fON NEARLY SEMIFREE CIRCLE ACTIONS\n\n9\n\ngroups G1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Gn . Let \u039bi be the projection of \u039b to Gi . Without loss of\ngenerality, we may assume that \u039bi 6= {id} for all i.\nProof of Theorem 1.4. Let G = G1 \u00d7* * *\u00d7Gn as above. Choose p \u2208 F and\nlet H \u2282 G be the stabilizer of p. Then \u039b \u2282 H. There exists a representation\nV of H, called the isotropy representation, so that a neighborhood of\nthe G-orbit through p is equivariantly diffeomorphic to a neighborhood of\nthe zero section of G \u00d7H V . Fix some simple factor Gi , and let Hi = H \u2229 Gi .\nAssume first that Hi is a proper subgroup. Note that gi is invariant under\nthe action of \u039b. Thus, since \u039b acts semifreely on g/h via the adjoint action,\n\u039bi acts semifreely on gi /hi . Thus, by Lemma 3.2 (ii) there exists an element\nhi \u2208 Hi that reverses \u039bi .\nSo assume on the contrary that Hi = Gi . Let \u039b\u2032 be the projection of \u039b\nonto the product of all the simple factors except Gi . Since \u039bi \u2282 Gi \u2282 H\nand \u039b \u2282 H, we must have \u039b\u2032 \u2282 H. Hence \u039b\u2032 acts on V . For any integer k,\nlet Vk denote the subspace of V on which \u039b\u2032 acts with weight k. Since \u039b\u2032\ncommutes with Gi , Vk is a representation of Gi . Since only a finite number\nof elements of G act trivially on M , Gi must act nontrivially on G\u00d7H V , and\nhence also on V . Therefore, there is some k so that the representation of\nGi on Vk is nontrivial. Because Gi is simple, \u039bi must act with both positive\nand negative weights on Vk . But the weights for the action of \u039b on Vk are\nthe weights for the action of \u039bi shifted by k. Hence, because F is a semifree\nfixed point component, k = 0 and the action of \u039bi on Vk is itself semifree.\nTherefore by Lemma 3.2 (i) there exists hi \u2208 Gi = Hi that reverses \u039bi .\nSince hi reverses \u039bi for each i, g = (h1 , . . . , hn ) reverses \u039b, as required.\nMoreover, since H1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Hn \u2282 H (in general they are not equal), g lies in\nH, and hence fixes p.\n\u2737\nProof of Theorem 1.6. Fix some simple factor Gi . Let W be the Weyl\ngroup of Gi . Let T \u2282 Gi be a maximal torus of Gi containing \u039bi . Let\n\u03a6 : M \u2212\u2192 t\u2217 be the moment map for the T -action. Pick any \u03be \u2208 t so that\nthe one parameter subgroup generated by \u03be is dense in T . Let p be any\npoint which maps to the minimum value of \u03a6\u03be , the component of \u03a6 in the\ndirection \u03be. By construction, p is a fixed point for T . Assume first that\n\u03a6\u03be (p) = 0, that is, the function \u03a6\u03be is nonnegative on M . Since the moment\npolytope \u03a6(M ) is invariant under the Weyl group W , this implies that \u03a6\u03c3*\u03be\nis also nonnegative on M for all \u03c3 \u2208 W . Because Gi is simple and \u03be is a\ngeneric point of t, for any nonzero x \u2208 t\u2217 there exists an element \u03c3 \u2208 W such\nthat (\u03c3 * \u03be, x) < 0. Applying this to x \u2208 \u03a6(M )r{0}, we see that \u03a6(M ) must\nbe the single point {0}, which is impossible, because the action is effective.\nTherefore, \u03a6(p) 6= 0.\nNow let us reconsider the action of G on M . Let H be the stabilizer of p\nin G, and let Hi = H \u2229 Gi . Since \u039b acts with at most twofold isotropy on\nG/H \u2282 M , \u039bi acts with at most twofold isotropy on Gi /Hi . Since \u03a6(p) is\nnot zero, the stabilizer of \u03a6(p) in Gi . is a proper subgroup of Gi . Since \u03a6\nis equivariant, this implies that Hi is a proper subgroup of Gi . By Lemma\n\n\f10\n\nDUSA MCDUFF AND SUSAN TOLMAN\n\n3.2 (iii), this implies that there exists gi \u2208 Gi which reverses \u039bi . Then\n(g1 , . . . , gn ) reverses \u039b.\n\u2737\nProof of Lemma 3.1. We now prove claims (a)-(d) on a case by case\nbasis, using the classification of compact simple Lie groups.

Since i \u03bbi = 0 and\n\u03bbi \u2208 Z for all i, there are an equal number of +1's and \u22121's, and the rest\nare 0's. Hence, \u03bb is the sum of orthogonal roots of the form \u03b7 = ei \u2212 ej .\nSince (\u03b7, \u03b7) = 2, this proves claim (a).\nSince \u03b4 = (e1 \u2212 ek ) + (ek \u2212 en+1 ), the roots \u00b1(e1 \u2212 ek ) and \u00b1(ek \u2212 en+1 )\nlie in L for all 1 < k < n + 1. If neither i nor j is equal equal to 1, then\nei \u2212 ej = \u2212(e1 \u2212 ei ) + (e1 \u2212 ej ) is also in L. This proves claim (b).\nWe now prove (c).

Moreover, in both cases, if the final\ninequality in the sentence is an equality, so are all the preceding ones. Since\ne \u03be4 = 0 or \u03be4 = \u2212 1 . In the former case,\nn \u2265 0, 0 \u2265 \u03be4 \u2265 \u2212 64 . Since \u03bb \u2208 l,\n2\n\u03be2 = \u03be3 = \u03be4 = 0, so \u03be1 + \u03be5 + \u03be6 = 0, so n = 0. Hence, \u03bb = (\u01eb1 \u2212 \u01eb6 ). In\nthe latter case, n is odd, so \u03be4 = \u2212 21 \u2265 n\u22124\n6 implies that n = 1. In this case,\n\u03bb = (\u01eb1 \u2212 \u01eb6 ) + (\u01eb + \u01eb1 + \u01eb2 + \u01eb6 ). This proves claim (a).\nSince \u03b4 = (\u01eb1 \u2212 \u01ebi ) + (\u01ebi \u2212 \u01eb6 ), the roots \u00b1(\u01eb1 \u2212 \u01ebi ) and \u00b1(\u01ebi \u2212 \u01eb6 ) lie in L\nfor all 1 < i < 6.

Since (\u03b1, \u03bb) \u2265 (\u03b6, \u03be), it is enough to show that (\u03b6, \u03be) > 1.\nThis fact now follows from the argument from A5 , since (\u03b4, \u03bb) = (\u03b4, \u03be) > 2,\nsince the Weyl group contains the permutation group S5 , and since \u03b6 must\nsatisfy \u03b6i \u2212 \u03b6j \u2208 Z.\nFinally, \u03b4 is the only root in the positive Weyl chamber.\nP\n(V, b) Recall that for the group E7 , t = t\u2217 = {\u03be \u2208 R8 |\n\u03bei = 0}, the\nroots are \u01ebi \u2212 \u01ebj and \u01ebi + \u01ebj + \u01ebk + \u01ebl for i, j, k, and l distinct, and the integral\nlattice is le = {\u03be \u2208 t | \u03bei \u00b1 \u03bej \u2208 Z \u2200 i, j}.
