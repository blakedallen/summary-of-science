Quantum effects alter the efficiency of atom transfer by the probe\n(repumper) laser to the levels connected by the pump (cooling) laser. This, combined with\nthe double resonance condition [1], leads to velocity selection from co-propagating and counter\npropagating pump and probe beams resulting in narrow fluorescence peaks from a thermal gas\nat room temperature.\n\nIntroduction. \u2013 Multilevel atoms, under the action of multiple fields, display a variety\nof phenomena brought about by the ac Stark splitting of electronic levels and by interference\ndue to induced coherences. These manifest themselves as splitting of peaks, inhibition of\nabsorption or emission, narrow windows of transparency, etc. Theoretical work on this front\nhave considered \u039b, V and ladder type of three level systems [2]. The presence of additional\nlevels increases multifold the possibilities of interference phenomena that exist. The nested\n\u039b and the N systems have been examined to some extent [3]. In this paper we examine an\n\"inverted N\" system using the density matrix formalism. Recent experimental observations\nin 85 Rb [1] have prompted the study of this four-level system under the action of two fields.\nExperiment. \u2013 The experiment in [1] consisted of driving a collection of 85 Rb atoms\nwith two fields- a strong \"cooling\" field and a weak \"repumper\" field. One of the lasers, the\ncooling (pump) laser was held at a fixed detuning \u03b4c from the conventional cooling transition\n(1 ) (5S1/2 , F = 3 \u2192 5P3/2 , F \u2032 = 4\u2032 ) and the repumper (probe) laser was scanned with its\ndetuning (\u03b4r ) from 5S1/2 , F = 2 \u2192 5P3/2 , F \u2032 = 3\u2032 level varying over the entire manifold, F=2\n\u2192 F'=1',2',3' (See Fig. 1) (2 ). Narrow fluorescence peaks were observed at definite \u03b4r for\na given \u03b4c . While one would expect a broad fluorescence, with the width indicative of the\ntemperature of the gas, the experiment showed fluorescence peaks just 30MHz in width, much\nsmaller than their Doppler width of 500MHz. This was explained on the basis of a double\nresonance model which maximised fluorescence whenever the atom found both the cooling and\nrepumping lasers on resonance with their respective transitions. A simple analytical treatment\nbased on the above model showed that atom transfer efficiency by the repumper laser to the\n(1 )The cooling and repumper beams are used in the sense as defined in [1].\n(2 )Hyperfine levels of 5S1/2 are denoted unprimed while that of 5P3/2 are denoted primed.\nc EDP Sciences\n\n\f2\n\nEUROPHYSICS LETTERS\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n85\n\n\u2212Z\n\nRb\n\n+Z\n\nF=4 '\n5P\n\n3/2\n\n121 MHz\n63 MHz\n\n3'\n\nCooling\n\n2'\n\nA\n\nC Cooling\n\nB\n\nD\n\nCooling transition\n\nD2 line\n\n1'\n5S F=3 => 5P F= 4\n\n780 nm\n\n1/2\n\n1/2\n\n3036 MHz\n\n5S\nF=2\n\nRepumper\n\nrepumper\n'\n\nF=3\n5S\n\n3/2\n\n1/2\n\n,F=2 => 5P\n\n3/2 ,\n\nF'= 1',2',3'\n\nRepumper\n\n85\nRb atom.\n\nFig. 1 \u2013 (a): Energy level diagram of 85 Rb. (b):A one dimensional configuration (along Z) of the\ncooling and repumper beams with the 85 Rb atom taken move along +z direction\n\nlevels connected by the cooling laser was maximised under the double resonance condition\nand gave rise to narrow fluorescence peaks.\nIn this paper, we present a rigorous treatment of the same problem using a four level\ndensity matrix formalism. Our treatment differs from the earlier studies of four-level density\nmatrix [4] in that (a) it considers an inverted N system and (b) it takes into account the\nmotion of the atoms in co- and counter-propagating geometries with respect to the cooling\nand repumper beams.\nFour Level Density Matrix. \u2013 The four levels under consideration are: the two ground\nhyperfine levels F=2,3 and the two excited levels F'=3',4'. For simplicity, we have considered\nan one dimensional situation where the two driving fields are in the \u00b1z direction and the\natom is moving along the z direction with a velocity ~v . The detuning of the cooling laser\ntaking the Doppler effect into account is \u2206c = \u03b4c \u2212 k~c .~v and the repumper laser's detuning is\n\u2206r = \u03b4r \u2212 k~r .~v where, \u03b4c and \u03b4r are the detunings of the laser in the laboratory frame. The\ntotal Hamiltonian for the system consisting of the atom and the light fields is written in the\ninteraction picture as\nH = H 0 + HI\n(1)\nwhere H0 is the Hamiltonian for the bare atom and HI is the atom-light interaction Hamiltonian. They are given as\nH0 = h\u0304\u03c92 |2 >< 2| + h\u0304\u03c93 |3 >< 3| + h\u0304\u03c93\u2032 |3\u2032 >< 3\u2032 | + h\u0304\u03c94\u2032 |4\u2032 >< 4\u2032 |\nand\nh\u0304\nHI = \u2212 [\u03a934\u2032 |3 >< 4\u2032 | exp (\u2212i\u03c9LC t) + \u03a933\u2032 |3 >< 3\u2032 |exp(\u2212i\u03c9LC t) + \u03a923\u2032 exp (\u2212i\u03c9LR t)|2 >< 3\u2032 | + H.C]\n2\nHere the h\u0304\u03c9i represent the energies of the levels as represented in Figure 1, with h\u0304\u03c92 taken\nas zero, \u03c9LC and \u03c9LR the frequencies of the cooling and repumper laser beams and \u03a9ij \u2032 is\nthe Rabi frequency connecting the levels i and j \u2032 .

Thus\nfor an atom with a velocity ~v we obtain the population of each level and coherence between\nvarious levels for different values of \u03b4r and \u03b4c .

Initially let us consider the atoms to be at rest. For a\ngiven detuning \u03b4c of the cooling (pump) laser, we should get fluorescence peaks corresponding\nto the Autler-Townes (AT) dressed states of F \u2032 = 3\u2032 at the probe (repumper) detunings [5]\nq\n\u03b4c3\u2032\n2 + \u03a92 )/2\n(21)\n\u00b1 (\u03b4c3\n\u03b4r\u00b1 =\n\u2032\n2\n(4 )Peaks (a) and (b) seen in the experiment arise due to the transitions from F \u2032 = 2\u2032 level which has not\nbeen included in our density matrix\n\n\fAndal Narayanan, R.Srinivasan, Ashok Vudayagiri, Uday Kumar Khan and Hema Ramachandran: Fluorescence from dou\n\n\u22123\n\n1.8\n\n(a)\n\nx 10\n\n(b)\n0.9\n0 MHz\n\n1.6\n0.8\n\nF = 3\n\n1.4\n0.7\n\n1\n\nPopulation in levels\n\nImaginary part of \u03c123'\n\n1.2\n\n\u221241 MHz\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.4\nF = 2\n\n0.3\n0.2\n\n0\n\u2212100\n\n\u221250\n\n0\n\u03b4 (MHz)\n\n50\n\n100\n\n0.2\n\u2212100\n\n\u221250\n\nr\n\n0\n\u03b4 (MHz)\n\n50\n\nr\n\nFig. 3 \u2013 The imaginary part of \u03c123\u2032 vs the positions of the probe absorption \u03b4r showing that absorption\nof the repumper (probe) light due to Autler -Townes splitting of the level F \u2032 = 3\u2032 occurs at the\ndetunings 0M Hz and \u221241M Hz.

For\nthe specific case shown in figure 2, for a cooling laser detuning \u03b4c = \u2212162M Hz and for small\n\u03a9, the Autler-Townes peak positions for these zero velocity atoms are \u03b4r\u00b1 \u2248 0, \u221241 MHz.\nThis is confirmed from our density matrix calculations. At these detunings of the probe its\nabsorption is maximised and repumping most efficient as seen from Figs. 3(a) and 3(b) which\ngive \u03c123\u2032 , \u03c133 and \u03c122 as functions of \u03b4r .\nConsider now an atom in motion with a velocity +v, along the +z direction. If \u03b4c < 0\nthis atom predominantly absorbs from the cooling beam coming towards it (C). Since the\nrepumper laser is scanned, depending on the sign of \u03b4r the atom absorbs either from B or\nfrom D. So for a given \u03b4c , altogether we get four peaks, a Autler-Townes pair each shifted\ndue to the Doppler effect, depending upon whether absorption takes place from the repumper\nbeam B or from repumper beam D. The same holds for \u03b4c > 0 for atoms with velocity \u2212v .\nThe AT doublet positions as given in equation (21) when applied to atoms in motion and,\nfor small \u03a9 and \u03b4c < 0 are\n\u03b4r\u2212 \u2212 (\u00b1kv) \u2248 0; \u03b4r+ \u2212 (\u00b1kv) \u2248 \u03b4c3\u2032 \u2212 (\u00b1kv)\n\n(22)\n\nAs the repumper is scanned, maximum transfer of population from F =2 to F= 3 will occur\nwhen these conditions are satisfied. Now, as mentioned in [1] and as will be shown shortly,\nthe fluorescence is predominantly from 4\u2032 \u2212 > 3. However, not all atoms in F =3 will be in\nresonance with the cooling laser; only a small velocity class around vc = \u03b4c /k will give rise\nto fluorescence. This is the mechanism that gives rise to narrow velocity selection from a hot\ngas. This velocity selection effect is confirmed by our calculations and is shown in Fig. 4\nwhich gives \u03c14\u2032 4\u2032 and \u03c13\u2032 3\u2032 as functions of the velocity of the atom for \u03b4c = \u03b4r = -162 MHz.

The very low population of F \u2032 = 3\u2032 in\n(a) is shown magnified in (b).\n\nsee that the population in F'=4' (\u03c14\u2032 4\u2032 ) is two orders more than that in F'=3' (\u03c13\u2032 3\u2032 ) and it\npeaks at the critical velocity vc = 126m/sec. Therefore only for velocities around vc will the\nfluorescence from F \u2032 = 4\u2032 be maximised, showing that indeed the double resonance condition\nselects a narrow velocity class for fluorescence.\nThe Autler-Townes peak positions, as given by equations ( 22), with the constraint that\ndouble resonance should also be satisfied for maximum fluorescence, require that\n\u03b4r\u2212 = \u03b4c ; \u03b4r+ = 121M Hz + \u03b4c\n\n(23)\n\nwhen repumper absorption takes place from D and\n\u03b4r\u2212 = \u2212\u03b4c ; \u03b4r+ = 121M Hz \u2212 \u03b4c (v = vc ); \u03b4r+ = 121M Hz + \u03b4c + 2kv(v 6= vc )\n\n(24)\n\nwhen repumper absorption takes place from B.\nThe same conditions result for atoms with a velocity \u2212v, for \u03b4c > 0. It has been estimated\nin [5] that the peak at \u03b4r\u2212 is broad and the one at \u03b4r+ is narrow. The width of the AT peaks\ndecide the prominence of a fluorescence peak as it decides the number of atoms participating\nin the fluorescence. Thus for peak positions \u03b4r\u2212 = \u03b4c & \u2212\u03b4c we expect a large fluorescence\nwhereas for the peak at \u03b4r+ = 121M Hz + \u03b4c we expect a much smaller fluorescence as is\nindeed seen from experiment and from our calculations (Fig. 2). As mentioned in [1] this\npeak is well resolved only at large detunings.\nThe peak around \u03b4r+ = 121 MHz + \u03b4c +2kv is absent both in experiment and in our density\nmatrix calculation. For this case, the repumper absorption takes place from B whereas the\ncooling is absorbed from C. When the absorption takes place from counter-propagating cooling\nand repumper beams the velocity class satisfying the double resonance is severely restricted.\nIn fact only for v = vc will the double resonance condition be satisfied. Atoms with v 6= vc\nwill see the cooling and repumper to be shifted by different detunings and hence will not\ncontribute to the fluorescence. Thus the peaks resulting from this configuration will not be\n\n\fAndal Narayanan, R.Srinivasan, Ashok Vudayagiri, Uday Kumar Khan and Hema Ramachandran: Fluorescence from dou\n\n\u22123\n\n(a)\n2\n\u03b4\n\nr\n\n=\n\n\u2212\u03b4\n\nc\n\n\u03b4\n\nr\n\n0.12\n\n(b)\n\nx 10\n\n= 162 MHz\n\n=\n\n121 MHz +\u03b4\n\nc\n\n+ 2kv\n\n1.8\n\n1.6\n0.1\n\nPopulation in the level F'=4'\n\nPopulation in the level F'=4'\n\n1.4\n0.08\n\n0.06\n\n0.04\n\n1.2\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n0.02\n0.2\n\n0\n100\n\n110\n\n120\n130\nvelocity in m/sec\n\n140\n\n150\n\n0\n100\n\n110\n\n120\n130\nvelocity in m/sec\n\nFig. 5 \u2013 Population in the level F \u2032 = 4\u2032 as a function of the velocity of atoms for the Autler-Townes\npeaks at (a) \u03b4r = \u2212\u03b4c = 162M Hz (b) \u03b4r = 121M Hz + \u03b4c + 2kv.\n\nresolvable as only a very small number of atoms contribute to it. The severely restricted\nvelocity range at resonance resulting in the absence of the peak at 121M Hz + \u03b4c + 2kv is\nillustrated in Fig. 5b which is obtained from the density matrix calculation. As we see here,\nonly a small number in a very narrow velocity range contribute to population in F'=4' in\ncontrast to the case \u03b4r\u2212 = \u2212\u03b4c (Fig. 5a).\nThe peaks marked (a) and (b) in Figure 2 are the peaks corresponding to the AT levels\nof F \u2032 = 2\u2032 at \u03b4r\u2212 = \u03b4c & \u2212\u03b4c corresponding to absorption from counter and co-propagating\nrepumper beams. Our calculation has not reproduced this peak, as the level F'=2' was not\nincluded in the density matrix. Nevertheless the peak positions can be simply calculated from\nthe corresponding peaks for F'=3' by shifting them by \u221263M Hz. The peak at \u03b4c + 121M Hz\nfalls at the same \u03b4r+ for both F \u2032 = 2\u2032 and F \u2032 = 3\u2032 .\nThe theoretically calculated widths of the fluorescence peaks match the experimentally\nobserved narrow width of about 30M Hz. It should be emphasised that this does not arise\ndue to the cooling of atoms in the optical molasses like configuration but due to the velocity\nselection as discussed above. These fluorescence peaks are experimentally seen to be narrow\neven for blue detunings of the cooling beam where no cooling occurs and the atoms are at room\ntemperature. The corresponding Doppler width is several hundred MHz at this temperature.\nThe additonal effects of cooling on these fluorescent peaks in a Doppler free beam geometry\nwill be discussed elsewhere.\nConclusions. \u2013 The experimental observations of [1] has been explained using a fourlevel density matrix formalism. The theory finds that the fluorescence peaks are given rise\nby the Autler-Townes (AT) doublets of F \u2032 = 3\u2032 and F \u2032 = 2\u2032 for atoms around a particular\nvelocity class. The theory gives the three AT peaks of F \u2032 = 3\u2032 at positions borne out by the\nexperiment. The theory also explains the absence of the fourth peak. The widths and heights\nof the peaks agree quite well with the experimentally obtained widths and heights.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Uday Kumar Khan et.al to be published\n\n140\n\n150\n\n\f8\n\n[2] Harris, S.E., Phys.
