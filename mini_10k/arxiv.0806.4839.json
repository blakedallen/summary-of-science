Lyngby, Denmark.\n\nA new operating regime of the Superconducting Quantum Interference Filter (SQIF) is\ninvestigated. The voltage to magnetic field response function, V(H), is determined by a\nFraunhofer dependence of the critical current and magnetic flux focusing effect in\nJosephson junctions (F-mode). For SQIF-arrays made of high-Tc superconducting\nbicrystal Josephson junctions the F-mode plays a predominant role in the voltage-field\nresponse V(H). The relatively large superconducting loops of the SQIF are used for\ninductive coupling to the external input circuit. It is shown that the output noise of a SQIFarray measured with a cooled amplifier in the 1\u20132 GHz range is determined by the slope of\nthe V(H) characteristic. Power gain and saturation power were evaluated using low\nfrequency SQIF parameters. Finally, we consider the influence of the spread in the\nparameters of Josephson junctions in the SQIF-array on the V(H) characteristic of the\nwhole structure.\nMicrowave amplifiers based on superconducting quantum interference effect in two\nparallel connected Josephson junctions (SQUID) are characterized by a noise temperature close\nto the quantum limit (see, e.g., [1, 2]). The SQUID-amplifiers as other Josephson devices\nwithout feedback possess a low saturation power, which is proportional to the characteristic\nvoltage V0 = ICRN where IC is the critical current and RN is the normal state resistance of the\nJosephson junction (JJ). V0 is 200\u00f7300\u03bcV at temperature T = 4.2K for JJs made from low-TC\nsuperconductors (LTcS) [2], and reaches V0 = 1mV at T = 77 K for bicrystal JJs made from highTC superconductors (HTcS) [3].\nUsing an array of JJs can increase the saturation power. A series-coupled LTcS SQUID\narray amplifier reported in [4] demonstrated an increase of the output signal proportional to the\n\n\fnumber N of SQUIDs. The spread in IC and RN of the JJs significantly restricts the application of\nseries-connected JJ or SQUID arrays.\nRecently, superconducting quantum interference filters (SQIF-array) [5\u20137] forming arrays\nof series-connected SQUIDs with sophistical distribution of SQIF-loop areas in order to have a\nsingle peak in the V(H) curve was suggested and studied for microwave amplification [8, 9].\nHowever, an application of incoherent interference from different SQIF\u2013loops is also possible.\nLarge inductances of the SQIF-loops Li >>LJ = \u03a60/2\u03c0Ic (\u03a60 is magnetic flux quantum) provide\nbetter coupling with the external circuits but suppress the main peak in the V(H) function, and in\nturn eliminates the possibility of using usual SQUID mode operation (S-mode).\nAlso very sensitive V(H) magnetometers based on one-dimensional series arrays of HTcS\nbicrystal JJ has been reported [10]. Here the Fraunhofer dependence of critical current for JJ\nIc(H)=Ic(0)sin(\u03a6J/\u03a60), (where \u03a6J=\u03c0\u03bc0HaJ is magnetic flux in a JJ with effective area aJ) and\nflux focusing effect due to geometry of the bicrystal JJ were used (we call this operation regime\nF-mode). A voltage transfer function dV/dH as large as 7500 V/T was obtained with 105\njunctions in an array that is similar to the LTcS SQUID array [4].\nIn this paper we present results of an experimental investigation of series-connected SQIFarray made from HTcS bicrystal JJs operating at f = 1-2GHz in the F-mode. Unlike usual seriesconnected JJs arrays both circulating currents and induced magnetic flux contribute to the\namplification process in our SQIF-arrays. The current in the SQIF-loops induced by an external\nmagnetic field is \u2013 so to say - transformed to a current circulating in the JJ. This provides the\ngood coupling to the external circuit.\nBicrystal NdGaO3 (NGO) substrates were used for samples fabrication. NGO is\ncharacterized by a tolerable permittivity (\u03b5 = 25) and low microwave losses (tg\u03b4<10-3). The\ndevices were patterned using ion-plasma and chemical etching of YBa2Cu3Ox (YBCO) film\ndeposited by dc sputtering at high oxygen pressure. Fabrication details for the bicrystal JJ have\nbeen described elsewhere [3]. For comparison SQUIDs and series-connected SQUID- arrays [8]\nwere fabricated. Fig.1 shows the topology of a SQIF-array designed for use as microwave\namplifier: the input line (Au film) was deposited over the SiO2 insulator layer, the bottom layer\nis the YBCO film which forms the SQIF-array located inside the input line, which provides the\nRF coupling of the input signal (see Fig.1, bottom inset). The output signal is taken directly from\nthe SQIF-array.\nWe measured I\u2013V-curves and magnetic field-to-voltage response V(H) at low frequency as\nwell as the output noise power PN = kBTN\u2206f in the frequency band \u2206f = 1GHz. For the latter we\nused a cryogenic preamplifier with noise temperature TA1 = (8\u00b12)K and gain G = 21dB followed\nby a room temperature amplifier with TA2 = 130K and G = 40dB. The output signal was\n\n\fsimultaneously recorded on a spectrum analyzer and detected by a quadratic detector built into\nthe room amplifier.\nFig. 2 shows a family of V(H) characteristics plotted at different dc bias currents, Ib. The\nexperimental V(H) curves clearly show the single F-mode dip around H = 0 with small lateral\nvoltage modulation. The both the reference SQUID and the series-connected SQUID-array\nshowed a pronounced superposition of S- and F-mode resulting in a strong lateral modulation\n[8]. The residual lateral modulation of the SQIF-array was additionally suppressed by increasing\nthe bias current Ib, leading also to a smoothing of the wings of the main V(H) dip. The expected\nincrease in the height of the V(H) response, being proportional to VS = \u03a3V0i , which increases\nwith the number N of SQIF-loop each contributing with V0i = ICiRNi. However, the experimental\nVS= 8mV was smaller than the estimated \u03a3V0i= 20mV for a SQIF-array with N = 20. A\nnumerical simulation of the V(H) dependence made using the PSCAN program [11] is shown in\nFig.3. One can see that for SQIF-arrays with N > 10 (see Fig.3) the S-mode modulation is\nsuppressed. Note, the experimental width of the F-mode dip is well fitted using an effective JJ\narea Seff = 30\u03bcm2 which is considerably larger than the area w\u03bbL= 1.5\u03bcm2 where w is the JJ\nwidth and \u03bbL = 0.15\u03bcm is the London penetration depth in YBCO. This is in agreement with a\nstrong flux focusing effect in the bicrystal JJ [12] with the magnetic field applied perpendicular\nto the film. The external magnetic flux, produced by the input signal coil, induces screening\ncurrent in superconducting loops of each of the SQIF elements. Since the width of the printed\nloops (equal to the geometrical width of the bicrystal JJ) are larger than \u03bbL the current near the\nouter edge of the printed loop flows in opposite direction of the current in the inner edge. Finally,\nthe current in the loop induced by the external magnetic field is transformed to the current\ncirculating in the JJ as a differential current.\nFrom the experimental magnetic diffraction pattern, IC(H), of the reference SQUID with\nloop area S = 35\u03bcm2 we estimate a loop inductance L = (15\u00b15)pH [13], which is much larger\nthan L = 1.25\u03bc0w. The estimated spread in critical current of JJ in SQUID is \u03b4I/IC = (30\u00b110)%1.\nFor a mean value of IC = 100\u03bcA for JJs with width w = 10\u03bcm we derive the normalized\ninductances in the SQIF-array to be in the range li = Li/LJ = 4.5-91. Taking into account a 30%\nspread of the critical currents ICi of JJ in SQIF-array a digital simulation gave a decrease of the\nF-mode dip and a total smearing out of the S-mode modulation as observed in the experiments.\nBesides, the range of dV/dH linearity, determining the saturation power of the SQIF-array, is ten\ntimes larger than in the reference SQUID-array. For the SQIF-array operating in F-mode we\n1\n\nAsymmetry of the JJs parameters in a SQUID for small inductance 0.2<l<2 yields an increase of the conversion\nfactor dV/dH compared to the dependence calculated for a symmetric SQUID [15]. If l >> 1 the dV/dH approaches\nan asymptotic slope symmetric SQUID and decreases significantly.\n\n\fobtain dV/d\u0424 = 40 mV/\u04240 (and dV/dH = 270 V/T), while for SQUID in the S-mode we have\ndV/d\u0424 = 1 mV/\u04240 [8].\nThe spectral density of the output noise temperature TN(H) measured in the frequency\nrange f = 1\u20132 GHz for a SQIF-array is presented in Fig.4. The residual S-mode peaks of the\nTN(H) dependence are correlated with the dV/dH function. The output power is up to 15 dB\nabove the background noise level. The measured output noise signal from the SQIF-array can be\ninterpreted as an incoherent superposition of voltage thermal fluctuations of JJs with a spectral\ndensity of SV = \u03a3(8kTRd2/RN)[1+1/2(I/IC)2] with a flux-to-voltage conversion noise\n\nS\u0424=\n\n\u03a3(2kTLn2/RN)(dVn/d\u0424n)2 [14]. For a bias current Ib = 1.25mA and Rd = 30 \u03a9 at the TN(H) peak we\nget S\u0424>>SV. It indicates that the observed output signal is dominated by the flux-to-voltage\nconversion (\u03a3LidVi/dHi)2. For the experimental conditions dV/d\u0424=40 mV/\u04240 the SQIF-array is\ncharacterized by a maximal flux sensitivity \u03b4\u0424 = 10-4 \u04240. The lateral deviations of the TN(H)\nwaveform and the corresponding V\u0424(H) dependence could be caused by residual contributions\nfrom the S-mode2.\nM 2 (dV / d\u0424) 2\n[17] we take Rs = 50\u03a9 as the\nIn order to estimate the power gain G =\nRd Rs\nmicrowave source resistance, the dynamic resistance Rd = 30 \u03a9 , a mutual coupling inductance M\n= 2.4 10-11 H, assuming a geometrical circuits coupling coefficient \u03b1 = 0.2 (for SQIF layout\nshown in Fig.1). Using the experimental value dV/d\u0424 = 2 1013 sec-1, as obtained from\nmeasurements at low frequencies, we get a reasonable value of G = 20 dB.\nFor estimation of the saturation power of the SQIF-array in the F-mode we measured the\noutput signal at low frequencies f = 49Hz \u2013 90kHz. The expected saturation power of noncoherently operating SQIF-loops increases as the square root of N, as PS \u221d\u221aN [5-7]. An analysis\nof the 1st and the 2d harmonics an applied 900 Hz signal shows a linear dependence over 60 dB\nwith slow deviations of the 2d harmonic distortion at about 1% (see inset to Fig.4). Note, a\nsimilar harmonic distortion was observed for a LTcS SQUID-amplifier operating in the S-mode\n[18].\nSummarizing, we have fabricated and studied SQIF-arrays operating in the F-mode when\nthe magnetic flux-to-voltage transfer factor is mostly determined by a Fraunhofer dependence of\nthe critical current of the Josephson junctions. The flux-to-voltage conversion factor in the Fmode is apparently lower than the originally suggested S-mode at the single SQIF-array peak,\n\n2\n\nNote, that differences in the critical currents in large inductive SQUIDs (l >> 1) may also enhance the S-mode\n\ncontribution [16] to the resulting output signal of the SQIF-array.\n\n\fnevertheless giving a power gain G > 1 and a significant increase in saturation power and\ndynamic range. Because of the large inductances of the SQUID- loops a spread in parameters of\nJosephson junctions doesn't play a decisive role in the F-mode, leading to a decrease in the\ncontributions of the SQUIDs in the array to the total gain, but allowing at the same time a good\nsignal amplification.\nThe authors thank I.V.

Layout of SQIF-array for microwave amplifier consisting of 20 series-connected SQUID\nloops with areas in the range 35\u2013700 \u03bcm2. The width w of the Josephson junctions is 10 \u03bcm. The\ninput line circuit consists of a top Au thin film (grey color) deposited over the SiO2 buffer layer.\nThe YBa2Cu3Ox (YBCO) thin film is the bottom layer (dark color). The output circuit is a slotline YBCO film with the SQIF-array located along the bicrystal boundary. The top inset shows a\nzoomed view of the bottom layer with a part of the SQIF array. Bottom inset shows a circuit with\nSQIF-array and pick-up loop.\nFig.2 Magnetic field-to-voltage response, V(H), of a SQIF array with 20 loops for different dc\nbias currents, Ib. The measurements were made at T = 4.2K. For the structure with critical current\nIC = 500\u03bcA the maximum in V(H) is Ib = 1.1* IC.\nFig.3 Numerical simulation (PSCAN program) of V(H) for SQIF arrays with different number of\nloops. For the SQIF-array consisting of N = 20 loops the normalized inductances are in the range\nli = 4.5 \u00f7 91. F- and S-peaks are clearly seen for N>10.\nFig.4 Magnetic field dependence of the equivalent noise temperature TN(H) for SQIF-array in\nthe frequency band f = 1\u20132GHz (solid line). The dash-dot line shows the dV/dH(H) dependence.\nThe bias current is Ib = 1.25IC, T = 4.2K. The insert shows the dependence of 1-st and 2-d\nharmonics of output signal Vout vs input signal Vin at frequency fin = 900Hz.\n\n\fFig. 1.\n\n\fFig. 2.\n\n\fFig. 3.\n\n\fFig. 4.\n\n\f"}
