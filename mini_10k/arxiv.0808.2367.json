INTRODUCTION\nRecently there has been increasing appreciation of the contribution that small aperture telescopes with wide fields of\nview can make to astronomical imaging surveys. The Pan-STARRS project is one example. However, there has been less\nappreciation of smaller telescopes for wide-field multi-object spectroscopy. But the idea of \u00e9tendue applies just as much\nto spectroscopic surveys as to imaging surveys. And the cheap cost of CCD detectors makes possible a huge increase in\nthe field for spectroscopy as well as imaging. Here we describe the basic concept and preliminary design of R. Content,\nand the science case for an extreme multiplex spectrograph for wide-field 4-m telescopes. The beauty of this instrument\ndesign is that there are a number of already existing 4-m telescopes with a 1\u00b0 field or more where this instrument could\nbe cheaply implemented. With a 1\u00b0 field, a rate of ~4000 spectra an hour or ~30000 spectra per night is achievable. With\na 3 deg2 field, ~12000 spectra per hour or ~100000 spectra per night would be possible. These rates make many surveys\npossible, especially for cosmology. And the rates that are achievable may be competitive with much more expensive\ninstrument proposals like WFMOS+SKA.\nWe shall therefore begin by describing the optical design concept of our proposed wide-field spectrographs, and then\ngive some examples of the powerful science that might be addressed by these instruments, before describing our\nconclusions.\n\n2. NG1DF/XMS CONCEPT\nThe fundamental technology driver here is the cheap cost of CCDs, which now makes it possible to tile a large focal\nplane cheaply and, coupled with an efficient optical design, still retain high image quality. As noted above, imaging\nsurveys such as Pan-STARRS are already exploiting the \u00e9tendue of small aperture telescopes with wide fields of view.\nHere we propose similarly to take advantage of the large \u00e9tendue of 4-m class Ritchey-Chretien telescopes for extreme\nmultiplex spectroscopy.\n*robert.content@durham.ac.uk; phone +44-191-334-3541\n\n\f2.1 Number of slits\nThe conceptual design of the Next Generation 1\u00b0 Field (NG1dF) instrument for the AAT 4-m and the Extreme Multiplex\nSpectrograph (XMS) instrument for the Calar Alto 3.5-m exploits this promising combination of aperture and field of\nview to allow slits to be placed on ~4000 targets. This estimated number assumes 1.5\" width and 10\" length; up to 10000\nslits could be in principle targeted if the 10\" slit width was reduced to a 1.5\" aperture, with a few hundred such sky slots\nto map the sky over the whole mask. The multiplex gain of the instrument would then be even greater. The estimate of\n4000 targets also assumes that the spectra would have a length of 200 slit width images on the detector. The width and\nlength of the slits depends on the seeing so a higher spectral resolution and a larger number of sources can be achieved\nwith better seeing.\n\n1\u00b0 field: no vignetting\n1.19\u00b0 field: 50% vignetting\n1.38\u00b0 field: 100% vignetting\n\nSpectrograph field\n\nFig. 1. The field of view of NG1dF for AAT 3.9-m, similar to that to XMS for the Calar Alto 3.5-m. The 1\u00b0 field is divided\ninto four square subfields.\n\n2.2 Spectrograph at prime-focus\nTo use the large 1\u00b0 field or more, the spectrograph must be at the prime focus. This put some constrains on its\ncharacteristics, mostly putting some limits on its weight and length. A unique spectrograph would easily be too large and\ntoo heavy so an array of smaller spectrographs was chosen instead. Our design contains 4 spectrograph units in each of\nNG1dF and XMS. Each unit has its own detector. A larger number of units would be used at a site of exceptional seeing\nand/or a telescope with a larger field corrector. Figure 1 shows the present baseline design for the AAT. The subfields\nare 100 mm wide at the corrector focus which corresponds to 26' on the sky. This size was designed for 2k x 2k\ndetectors. With 4k x 4k detectors, larger subfields may be possible.\n\n\fDetector\n\nRemovable box\n(one per band)\n\nMask\n\nFig. 2. The design of a single spectrograph for the NG1dF/XMS instrument; four of these are needed to cover the 1\u00b0 field of\nclassical 4-m telescopes shown in Fig. 1. The box containing the disperser is changed when changing of band or\nspectral resolution or for imaging.\n\n\fWhile there is some vignetting outside the 1\u00b0 field, there is still a lot of light getting through in the 4 corners of the\nspectrograph so this region is not lost. With a proper tiling of the sky, some sources in the vignetted area can be observed\ntwice and the light added by software. This would increase the effective surface area of the field of view.\nOne difficulty with many spectrograph units is to place these units near each other to minimize the gaps in the field.\nIdeally, all optics in a spectrograph unit would be smaller than the subfield width. This would permit to pack the units\ntightly. This is achieved in our design by placing a field lens as near as possible to the input focal plane to bend the\nbeams toward the centre (fig. 2). Mechanically, the spectrograph can be made as one structure or each unit can be a\nseparate structure. A combination of both is also possible. While a unique structure would make the spectrograph more\nrigid for a specific weight, it makes alignments more difficult.\n2.3 Low cost spectrograph\nFor this concept to be practical, it is necessary that the price is maintained sufficiently low. A first part of the solution is\nto avoid the complex mechanism and spectrograph shape that comes with reflective gratings. A transparent disperser\ncombining a transparent grating, as a grism or a VPH, with prisms permits to make the units straight (fig. 2) and makes it\npossible to place optics very near the disperser which in turn reduces the size of the spectrograph and reduces the\naberrations. Different dispersers will have different prism angles and materials depending on the band and spectral\nresolution. For low spectral resolution, a grism or a grism plus a prism would do. For high resolution, VPH glued to\nprisms would be the preferred option.\nThe second part of the solution is to use low cost glasses. This however makes it difficult to design the spectrograph\nachromatic. To resolve this problem, we take advantage of the need to change the disperser when changing of band. In\nour solution, one or 2 lenses are changed with the disperser. These lenses can be made small and thin and would fit in a\nsmall box with the disperser (fig. 2). A special care must be taken when designing them to avoid the need of tight\nalignments of the disperser boxes which would increase the cost. One or more of the boxes can be made of lenses only\nand used for imaging; alternately, the disperser alone can be replaced by some optics in each box.\n2.4 Changing mechanism\nTo maintain a low cost, there must be as little mechanisms as possible. The basic concept is to use only one disperser per\nnight and to have it changed by hand during the day. It may however be necessary to have some imaging capability for\nacquisition. If no practical alternative method can be found, it would be necessary to have a changing mechanism with 2\npositions, most probably a slide.\nThe problem is different for the mask; many of them are necessary every night. The 2 main alternatives are a wheel or a\njukebox like mechanism as in GMOS. The wheel would support a smaller number of masks than the jukebox but is\nsimpler mechanically.\n2.5 Spectral resolution\nThe basic concept is for a resolution of 10\u01fa between wavelengths of 0.7 \u03bcm and 0.9 \u03bcm with a 1.5\" slit. We could then\nuse 2k x 2k CCDs with 24 \u03bcm pixels which gives a sampling of 2 pixels per 1.5\" slit image. This sampling does not take\nadvantage of better seeing however. For 0.9\" slits, 4k x 4k detectors are necessary. The resolution then becomes 6\u01fa with\nthe same design. Higher resolution are however possible by changing the disperser. The prisms associated with a high\nresolution disperser would need to have a larger interior angle but the present angle is quite small so it is perfectly\npossible to at least double the resolution.\nMuch higher resolutions are also possible but request some significant changes to the design. The camera and collimator\ncould not be maintained in a straight line; the camera would need to be at an angle. This is feasible with a spectrograph\nthat has no more than 6 units but would be problematic with a larger number of units where some are completely\nencircled by other units. To have a sufficiently large bandwidth at high resolution, it would probably be necessary to\nhave a camera angle that can be changed. This would of course increase the complexity and the cost of the system.\n2.6 Wavelength range\nThere is a choice of 2 bands in the present design, each with its own disperser+lenses box. Their wavelength ranges are\nrespectively 0.5 \u03bcm to 0.7 \u03bcm and 0.7 \u03bcm to 0.9 \u03bcm. There are then only 2 boxes in the basic design. It is however\npossible to have other bands. One choice is to have a range of 0.7 \u03bcm to 1.0 \u03bcm instead of 0.9 \u03bcm with a resolution of\n\n\f15\u01fa instead of 10\u01fa with 1.5\" slits. Another would be to have 3 bands between 0.42 \u03bcm and 1.0 \u03bcm, for example 0.42\n\u03bcm to 0.55 \u03bcm, 0.55 \u03bcm to 0.74 \u03bcm and 0.74 \u03bcm to 1.0 \u03bcm.\n\n3. SCIENCE CASE\nThere are many science goals for an instrument of this sort, ranging from galaxy surveys for cosmology at low resolution\n(R~400) to stellar radial velocity and abundance surveys at 10x higher resolution (R~4000). Here we concentrate on the\nlow resolution cosmological aspects which form our particular interest in the science from these instruments.\n3.1 Emission and absorption line galaxy redshift surveys at z~0.7.\nA prime cosmological goal for the NG1dF/XMS instruments is based on their ability to measure 4000 galaxy redshifts\nper hour for i<21 absorption-line and i<22 emission-line galaxies at z~0.7 (see Fig. 3). 4000 emission/absorption\nredshifts an hour means ~30000 redshifts a night or ~6 x106 galaxy redshifts in a 200 night survey. Such a survey could\ncover 1000-2000 deg2 of sky and enable powerful new investigations of the clustering of galaxies to be made over a wide\nrange of scales (0.1-1000h-1Mpc).\nA prime aim would be to measure the scale-length of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) as detected in galaxy\nclustering power spectra and correlation functions. These features are seen as an oscillation in the power spectrum and as\na spike in the galaxy correlation function. These features can be used as standard rods and allow tests of cosmological\nmodels. In particular, such observations will allow us to probe the equation of state of the vacuum energy, p=w\u03c1.\nCurrently, the spike in the correlation function is tentatively detected in the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey of 250000 z~0.1\ngalaxies [1] and also in the SDSS redshift survey of ~75000 z~0.35 Luminous Red Galaxies [2]. In future bigger galaxy\nsurveys will be needed to measure the BAO scale at higher redshifts and hence track any evolution in the vacuum energy\nequation of state with redshift. Instruments like NG1dF/XMS therefore will have a crucial role to play in the future of\nobservational cosmology.\nThere are enough galaxies at the magnitude limits quoted above to fill ~4000 NG1dF/XMS slits since galaxy count data\nsuggest that there are ~4000 galaxies per square degree at i<21 and ~9000 at i<22, 5000 of which will show emission\nlines. The ~9000 absorption and emission line galaxies available in total will make it more possible to place slits on a\nsubset of ~4000 galaxies. The future for BAO studies is to identify systematics caused by non-linearity in galaxy power\nspectra that may results in different scale-lengths being measured for different types of galaxy. The high multiplex of\nNG1dF/XMS will, for example, mean that a choice will no longer have to be made between emission-line galaxies and\nluminous red galaxies for BAO measurement since both can be observed simultaneously in the same volume and the\nBAO results compared. Similar comparisons can be made as a function of morphology and luminosity class, given the\nhigh numbers of galaxies available.\nOther cosmological applications of redshift surveys containing millions of z~0.7 galaxies will include measuring the rate\nof growth of structure using galaxy clustering redshift-space distortions. Here the flattening of galaxy clustering in\nredshift-space caused by dynamical infall is used to provide a measure of the infall parameter \u03b2=\u03a90.6/b and measuring \u03b2\nat different redshifts gives the gravitational growth rate. This provides a test of Einstein's gravity independently of\ngeometrical cosmological tests using standard candles and rods, such as BAO. Redshift distortion results can also be\nused to give an estimate of the masses and hence mass-to-light ratios of galaxy group haloes in CDM models. These\nallow new tests of the efficiency of the process of galaxy formation as a function of halo mass environment. There are\ntoo many examples of other galaxy redshift survey-based projects to detail here. These include the vast array of results\nthat will be available on the topic of the dependence of the galaxy stellar mass and luminosity function on environment\nand redshift.\n3.2 Lyman break galaxy redshift surveys at z~3.\nMore ambitiously, it may be possible for 4-m telescopes to compete effectively on surveying the Universe of galaxies at\nredshift, z~3. In 4x3hr exposures, spectra for ~4000 r<25 Lyman break galaxies at z~3 (fig. 4) can be measured,\nproducing 100000 z~3 galaxy redshifts in a 50 night survey. Although the exposure time is long, a single mask will\nproduce as many redshifts at z~3 as are currently known from larger telescopes. A prime scientific aim would then again\nbe to measure the BAO scale in the LBG clustering, allowing the first constraints on the dark energy equation of state at\nz~3. Furthermore, measuring redshift space distortions in the galaxy clustering would give constraints on the gravity\n\n\fmodel at z=3 and also allow the dependence of the halo M/L ratio on redshift to be estimated and hence the evolution\nwith time of the efficiency of the galaxy formation process. In terms of a survey plan that would include the lower\nredshift z~0.7 galaxies discussed in Section 3.1, in a total survey time of 250 nights, flexible scheduling might allow the\n50 nights with the best seeing to be used to observe fainter LBG targets with 1 arcsec wide slits and the remaining 200\nnights could be used for the z~0.7 galaxy redshift survey where 1.5-2 arcsec wide slits might be used. This 250 night\nsurvey plan might then realize redshifts for 100000 z~3 LBGs as well as for ~6 million z~0.7 galaxies.\n\nFig. 3. The exposure time of 1-2 hrs to measure spectra for i<21 galaxies is suggested from exposure times for LRGs with\nthe fibre-fed AAOmega spectrograph at the AAT. The figure shows the galaxy spectra measured by the AAOmega\nspectrographs at ~5Angstrom resolution and degraded to the ~10Angstrom NG1dF/XMS resolution [3]. These spectra\nare therefore typical of those that can be achieved with XMS/NG1dF; emission-line and absorption-line features are\nclearly visible at this resolution.\n\n\f3.3 Calibration of photometric redshifts\nA prime use of galaxy surveys like both of those above will be the calibration of photometric redshifts. These are needed\nto support satellite surveys such as SNAP and also EUCLID which is the new ESA dark energy mission resulting from\nthe merging of SPACE and DUNE [6]. For example, it has been suggested that up to ~100000 spectroscopic redshifts\nmay be needed to calibrate the large photometric redshift surveys planned in the case of the SNAP satellite. Large\nnumbers of galaxies are particularly needed where large galaxy redshift training sets are needed as in the case of\nArtificial Neural Network (ANN) photometric redshift codes [5]. The NG1dF/XMS absorption and emission line galaxy\nredshift surveys described above will be uniquely placed to satisfy this huge demand for spectroscopic redshifts for\nphoto-z calibration and would complement the work of these satellites, for example EUCLID would not observe galaxies\nat a redshift smaller than 0.7.\n3.4 Stellar velocity and abundance surveys\nIn its higher resolution mode (R~4000) NG1dF/XMS can also be used for a variety of other purposes. At low Galactic\nlatitudes and in the Galactic bulge, stars brighter than i=15 will have sky densities larger than 4000 per deg-2 and can\ntherefore be efficiently observed with this instrument. At these magnitudes, 1-2hr observations will yield an S/N per\nAngstrom > 50 and thus allow stellar radial velocities and abundances of useful accuracy to be achieved. This will allow\nGalactic archaeology projects searching for stellar streams in the Galactic bulge and thick disk to proceed. Although the\nvelocity accuracy in will not be high enough in nearby dwarf galaxies, stellar abundance studies will certainly be\npossible in the higher resolution mode of NG1dF/XMS.\n\nFig. 4. Seven spectra of Lyman break galaxies at z~3 from a VLT VIMOS survey [4]. Two faint QSO spectra from the same\nsurvey are also shown. These spectra taken with the VIMOS LR Blue grism have lower resolution (~20Angstroms) and\nshow that such surveys will be perfectly possible with the default 10Angstrom resolution of the NG1dF/XMS\nspectrographs.\n\n4. CONCLUSIONS\nClearly, spectrographs such as NG1dF/XMS have huge potential impact in terms of the significant science goals they\naddress. There are many ground-based optical and near infra-red imaging surveys coming up such as Pan-STARRS, VST\nATLAS+KIDS, ALHAMBRA/PAU, Dark Energy Survey, VISTA Hemisphere Survey and VIKING surveys and also\nLSST. These will inevitably need spectroscopic follow-up and NG1dF is ideally designed to do this. This spectroscopic\nfollow-up will include the major science programs described above including the measurement of the BAO scale and the\nmeasurement of the evolution of the gravitational growth rate. These address major science questions including the\n\n\fnature of dark energy and its evolution and whether Einstein's gravity can explain the observed growth of large-scale\nstructure. However NG1dF/XMS are not \"niche instruments\" because of the wide variety of science goals they can\npursue, of which we have only noted a few examples here.\nA major driver is that these instruments can exploit already existing 4-m telescopes with large fields of view and\ntherefore this helps keep costs low. The modular spectrograph design is also aimed at being relatively low-cost as well as\nmaintaining high throughput over a wide field of view. The exact cost is the subject of the ongoing design studies but a\npreliminary cost estimate (including manpower) is around \u00a32m. The four 4kx4k CCD detectors and associated\ncontrollers and Dewars comprise a large fraction (~1/3) of this cost.\nWe conclude that the future for classically designed 4-m telescopes with large fields may be bright if they are armed with\nspectrographs such as NG1dF/XMS. Indeed, such telescope-instrument combinations may offer a very cost-effective\nsolution to pursuing the large-scale cosmological surveys that are needed to address the fundamental questions of the\ndark energy and its evolution with redshift and one which is competitive scientifically with more ambitious projects such\nas WFMOS and SKA.\n\nREFERENCES\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n\nCole, S.M., et al., \"The 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey: power-spectrum analysis of the final data set and cosmological\nimplications\", MNRAS 362, 505 (2005).\nEisenstein, D.J., et al, \"Detection of the Baryon Acoustic Peak in the Large-Scale Correlation Function of SDSS\nLuminous Red Galaxies\", ApJ 633, 560 (2005).\nBielby, R.M, Ross, N.P., Sawangwit, U., Shanks, T., et al, in prep.
