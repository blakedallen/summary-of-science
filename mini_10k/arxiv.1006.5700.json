CALDERBANK\n\nIntroduction\nOur purpose in this work is to present a comprehensive, uniform, invariant, and selfcontained treatment of the conformal geometry of submanifolds. This paper begins the\nstudy in three parts. In the first two parts, we present the general theory of conformal\nsubmanifolds: in Part I we develop an intrinsic theory of conformal manifolds; then in\nPart II, we investigate the geometry induced on an immersed submanifold of a conformal\nmanifold. The central result is an analogue in conformal geometry of the theorem of\nO. Bonnet which characterizes submanifolds of euclidean space in terms of geometric data\nsatisfying Gauss\u2013Codazzi\u2013Ricci equations. We demonstrate, in Part III, how this theory\ngives a systematic description of three integrable systems arising in conformal submanifold\ngeometry, which describe three classes of submanifolds and their spectral deformations:\nconstrained Willmore surfaces, isothermic surfaces, and 'M\u00f6bius-flat' submanifolds, these\nlast being Guichard or channel surfaces in dimension two (and codimension one), and\nconformally flat submanifolds in higher dimension.\nThe conformal geometry of submanifolds has been of great interest to differential geometers for more than a century, and our contribution is far from being the first treatment of\nthe conformal Bonnet theorem: the ideas go back at least to E. Cartan's beautiful 1923 paper [37]. Since then, there have been many attempts to understand conformal submanifold\ngeometry, either by authors wishing to build on Cartan's work, or by those unaware of it.\nIn particular, the subject was taken up in the 1940's by K. Yano [82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88],\nwho showed (together with Y. Mut\u00f4) that m-dimensional conformal submanifolds of S n\ncould be characterized, for m > 3, by tensors gjk , MjkP and LP Qk satisfying five equations,\nthree of which are analogues of the Gauss\u2013Codazzi\u2013Ricci equations in euclidean geometry-\nthese last three are also discussed more recently by L. Ornea and G. Romani [65]. Another\nextensive account, from Cartan's point of view, was developed in the 1980's by C. Schiemangk and R. Sulanke [68, 71, 72], who obtained a conformal Bonnet theorem at least for\nthe generic case of submanifolds with no umbilic points.\nThe issue of umbilic points is an significant one. Recall that these are points where the\ntracefree part of the second fundamental form, which is a conformal invariant, vanishes.\nHowever, following ideas of T. Thomas [75], A. Fialkow [46, 47] already noticed in 1944\nthat in the absence of umbilic points, there is a unique metric in the conformal class\non the submanifold, with respect to which the tracefree second fundamental form has\nunit length. This observation allowed him to obtain a treatment of generic conformal\nsubmanifold geometry in purely riemannian terms. Around the same time J. Haantjes [51,\n52, 53] and J. Maeda [62] presented a conformal theory of curves and surfaces. Subsequent\nauthors have also obtained results in varying degrees of generality: let us mention, for\ninstance, G. Laptev [60], M. Akivis and V. Goldberg [1, 2], G. Jensen [57], C. Wang [78, 79]\nand the book [12] of R. Bryant et al. on exterior differential systems.\nIn view of all this work, we would be bold to claim that the main results of Parts I and\nII are new. However, we believe there is no complete discussion of conformal submanifold\ngeometry in the literature with all three of the following features:\n\u2022 manifest conformal invariance;\n\u2022 no restriction on umbilic points;\n\u2022 uniform applicability in arbitrary dimension and codimension.\nNevertheless, we have no quarrel with the Reader who would prefer to regard Parts I\u2013II of\nthis work as a modern gloss on Cartan's seminal paper [37]: as we shall see, recent developments in conformal geometry make such a gloss extremely worthwhile. Our approach is\nalso greatly inspired by Sharpe's significant book [70], which presents the general theory\nof Cartan geometries to a modern audience, with many applications. Unfortunately, his\n\n\fCONFORMAL SUBMANIFOLD GEOMETRY I\u2013III\n\n3\n\napplication to conformal submanifold geometry contains a technical error, which leads him\nto restrict attention to the generic case only (no umbilic points) when studying surfaces.1\nAnother motivation for the present work is the recent development of a deeper understanding of the algebraic structures underlying conformal geometry, which we wish to apply.\nThere are five aspects to this which we now explain: M\u00f6bius structures, parabolic geometries, tractor bundles, Lie algebra homology, and Bernstein\u2013Gelfand\u2013Gelfand operators.\nA central difficulty in conformal submanifold geometry lies in the description of low\ndimensional submanifolds. The problem, in a nutshell, is that curves and surfaces in a\nconformal manifold acquire more intrinsic geometry from the ambient space than simply\na conformal metric. This is closely related to the fact that in dimension one or two there\nare more local conformal transformations than just the M\u00f6bius transformations: in one\nor two dimensions, M\u00f6bius transformations are real or complex projective transformations\nrespectively. In fact, we shall see that a curve in a conformal manifold acquires a natural\nreal projective structure, whereas a surface acquires a (possibly) non-integrable version of\na complex projective structure. We call these M\u00f6bius structures-the 2-dimensional ones\nwere introduced in [24] under this name.\nOur paper might more properly be called 'M\u00f6bius submanifold geometry' (cf. [68, 78]):\nM\u00f6bius structures provide a notion of conformal geometry which applies uniformly in all\ndimensions, modelled on the n-sphere S n with its group of M\u00f6bius transformations. It is\nwell known (as observed by Darboux [38]) that this group is isomorphic to the semisimple\ngroup O+ (n + 1, 1) of time-oriented orthogonal transformations of an (n + 2)-dimensional\nlorentzian vector space: indeed the Lorentz transformations act transitively on the projective light-cone, which is an n-sphere, and the stabilizer of a light-line is a parabolic\nsubgroup of O+ (n + 1, 1). (Similarly, the model for conformal geometry in signature (p, q)\nis the projective light-cone in Rp+1,q+1 ; for notational convenience we restrict attention to\neuclidean signature, but the theory applies more generally with minor modifications.)\nCartan geometries provide a systematic way to make precise the notion of a curved\nmanifold modelled on a homogeneous space [70]. The geometries modelled on G/P , where G\nis semisimple and P is a parabolic subgroup, are called parabolic geometries [25, 31, 33, 35].\nHence (M\u00f6bius) conformal geometry is a parabolic geometry.\nOne way to provide a uniform description of conformal submanifold geometry-and this\nis the approach taken by Sharpe-is to use Cartan connections throughout. However this\nraises a subtle question of philosophy, concerning the distinction between 'intrinsic' and\n'extrinsic' geometry. The problem is that there is a lot of 'room' in a Cartan connection to\nhide extrinsic data: even in higher dimensions a conformal Cartan connection can contain\nmuch more information than just a conformal metric. However, it is well-known-and\ndue to Cartan [37] of course-that there is a preferred class of Cartan connections, the\nnormal Cartan connections which, in any dimension n > 3, correspond bijectively (up to\nisomorphism) with conformal metrics. We extend this result to dimensions one and two,\nby establishing, in a self-contained way, the existence and uniqueness of the normal Cartan\nconnection for (M\u00f6bius) conformal geometry in all dimensions.\nTo do this, we use a linear description of conformal Cartan connections, pioneered\nby Thomas [75] (although it is also implicit in [37]), and rediscovered independently by\nP. Gauduchon [48] and by T. Bailey et al. [3], then developed further by A. \u010cap and\nA.R. Gover [28, 29, 30]. A Cartan connection may be viewed as a connection on a principal\nG-bundle satisfying an open condition with respect to a reduction to P ; however, it can\n1The error is in the evaluation of the Ricci trace in the proof of [70, Proposition 7.4.9 (a)], where Sharpe\nclaims that a component of the Cartan connection does not influence the curvature of surface: in fact it\nis the case of curves, not surfaces, which is special in this respect. Hence in [70, Theorem 7.4.29] and [70,\nCorollary 7.4.30], n 6= 2 should be replaced by n 6= 1.\n\n\f4\n\nFRANCIS E. BURSTALL AND DAVID M. J. CALDERBANK\n\nbe more convenient to work with a connection on a vector bundle. Such vector bundles\nwith connection, induced by a Cartan connection, are now called tractor bundles or (local)\ntwistor bundles [3, 4, 29]. In conformal Cartan geometry, when G = O+ (n + 1, 1), the\nconformal Cartan connection on the associated Rn+1,1 -bundle is easy to characterize, and,\nfollowing [3, 48], this is what we do.\nThe existence and uniqueness of the normal Cartan connection is now known to be a\ncharacteristic feature of parabolic geometries, governed by a beautiful algebraic machine,\nLie algebra homology [4, 31, 34, 59, 64, 73]: the normality condition means that the curvature of the Cartan connection is a 2-cycle in a chain complex for this homology theory.\nIt turns out that Lie algebra homology also governs the extrinsic geometry of conformal\nsubmanifolds. A priori, there are many ways to split an ambient Cartan connection, along a\nsubmanifold, into tangential and normal parts. However, as observed by Sharpe [70], there\nis a unique choice such that the associated second fundamental form is tracefree. This\nway of normalizing the extrinsic geometry amounts to requiring that the 'extrinsic' part\nof the Cartan connection is a 1-cycle in a Lie algebra homology chain complex. (Sharpe\ndoes not then normalize the induced 'intrinsic' Cartan connection, which leads him to\nremark [70, page 266] that \"the Willmore form, while appearing to be extrinsic data from\nthe Riemannian perspective, is seen to be intrinsic data from the perspective of the M\u00f6bius\ngeometry induced on M .\" We do not agree with this viewpoint.)\nThe final ingredient of our approach, the Bernstein\u2013Gelfand\u2013Gelfand operators, reveals\nthat the Gauss\u2013Codazzi\u2013Ricci equations also have a natural homological interpretation.\nThis is a feature of parabolic geometry that has only been fully elucidated in the last ten\nyears [35, 25]. Since any tractor bundle W is equipped with a connection, there is an associated twisted deRham sequence of W -valued differential forms; these bundles also form the\nchain complex computing W -valued Lie algebra homology (where the Lie algebra boundary\noperator acts in the opposite direction to the twisted deRham differential). It turns out that\nthe twisted deRham sequence descends to give a sequence of (possibly) higher order operators between the Lie algebra homology bundles. This Bernstein\u2013Gelfand\u2013Gelfand sequence\nis a curved version of the (generalized) Bernstein\u2013Gelfand\u2013Gelfand complex on a (generalized) flag variety G/P which is a resolution of a G-module corresponding to W [5, 61]. The\ncurved analogues were introduced by M. Eastwood and J. Rice [41] and R. Baston [4] in\nspecial cases, and by \u010cap, J. Slovak and V. Sou\u010dek [35] in general. Further, it was shown\nby the second author and T. Diemer [25] that wedge products of tractor-valued differential\nforms descend to give bilinear differential operators between Lie algebra homology bundles.\nThis is the most novel aspect of our conformal Bonnet theorem: we show that the\nGauss\u2013Codazzi\u2013Ricci equations may be written in terms of the manifestly M\u00f6bius-invariant\nlinear and bilinear differential Bernstein\u2013Gelfand\u2013Gelfand operators defined on Lie algebra\nhomology. This is not just an aesthetic point, but a practical one: it reveals the minimal,\nhomological, data describing the geometry of the conformal submanifold, and shows that of\nthe five Gauss\u2013Codazzi\u2013Ricci equations appearing in other treatments (such as [88]), only\nthree are needed in each dimension-which three depends on the Lie algebra homology in\nthat dimension. This fact is tedious to check directly, but follows easily from [25].\nThis treatment of conformal submanifold geometry suggests a broader context for our\nwork: parabolic subgeometries. If we regard conformal submanifolds as being modelled\non the conformal m-sphere inside the conformal n-sphere, then we might more generally\nconsider geometries modelled on arbitrary (homogeneous) inclusions between generalized\nflag varieties. A particularly important case is the conformal n-sphere (or a hyper-quadric\nof any signature) in RP n+1 , which is the model for hypersurfaces in projective space.\nIn a subsequent work [15] (see [16] for a foretaste, and some preliminary results) we shall\nshow that our methods do indeed generalize to a wider setting, supporting the claim that\n\n\fCONFORMAL SUBMANIFOLD GEOMETRY I\u2013III\n\n5\n\nour machinery is natural. In the present work, we demonstrate that it is also effective,\nby exploring some applications. A number of classical results follow effortlessly (once the\nmachine is up and running), often in greater generality than was previously known.\nContents and results. Having set out our stall, let us explain in more detail the fruit\non offer. As we remarked at the start of this introduction, our development of conformal\nsubmanifold geometry, begins with two parts, like those of Cartan [37]: intrinsic conformal\ngeometry, and the geometry of submanifolds. In the first part of the paper, we present\nan unashamedly modern treatment of (M\u00f6bius) conformal geometry in all dimensions. We\nhave an auxiliary goal here, to show that it is perfectly possible-and indeed desirable-to\ncarry out computations in conformal geometry without introducing a riemannian metric in\nthe conformal class. Indeed, when a choice must be made, we wish to show that it is actually\nsimpler to introduce a Weyl structure, i.e., a torsion-free conformal connection. This avoids\nthe conformal rescaling arguments and logarithmic derivatives that are still prevalent in\na surprisingly (to us) large portion of the literature. We believe that conformal geometry\nis more about conformal invariance than conformal covariance (in line with the modern\ncoordinate free, rather than covariant, view of differential geometry).\nIn fact we offer the Reader two manifestly invariant approaches to conformal geometry:\na top-down, or holistic, one, the conformal Cartan connection, and a bottom-up, or reductionist, one, the M\u00f6bius structure. We develop these in parallel in the first part of the\npaper: the 'A' paragraphs (\u00a7\u00a71A\u20134A) concern conformal Cartan connections, while the 'B'\nparagraphs (\u00a7\u00a71B\u20134B) concern M\u00f6bius structures. The goal of our treatment is to prove\nthat these two notions of conformal structure are equivalent, which we reach in section 5.\nBoth approaches are motivated by the projective light-cone description of the conformal\nsphere S n , the 'flat model' for conformal geometry. The top-down approach, which consists\nof a (filtered) vector bundle V equipped with a 'conformal Cartan connection', generalizes\nthe bundle S n \u00d7 Rn+1,1 with its trivial connection. In section 1, we show how straightforward it is to prove that a manifold M with a flat conformal Cartan connection is locally\nisomorphic to S n -the same idea underlies our proof of the conformal Bonnet theorem in\nsection 10. We also show how such a conformal Cartan connection induces the most basic\ningredient in the bottom-up approach: a conformal metric.\nIn section 2, we introduce bundles of conformal algebras: first the bundle so(V ) of filtered\nLie algebras, then its associated graded algebra, which we identify with T M \u2295 co(T M ) \u2295\nT \u2217M . Here we discuss the most crucial elements of Lie algebra homology theory for the\ndevelopment. In section 3 we turn to Weyl derivatives. From the top-down approach,\nthese are equivalently complementary subspaces to the filtration of V , whereas from the\nbottom-up approach, they correspond to torsion-free conformal connections on T M .\nThe key idea in the first part of the paper is introduced in section 4. Here we reveal\nextra information hidden in a conformal Cartan connection in the form of two second order\ndifferential operators. These operators motivate our definition of M\u00f6bius structure. We\nthen define a distinguished class of 'conformal' M\u00f6bius structures, thus paving the way for\nour proof in section 5 of the following result.\nTheorem. There is a one-to-one correspondence, up to natural isomorphism, between\nM\u00f6bius structures and conformal Cartan geometries, and the conformal Cartan connection is normal if and only if the M\u00f6bius structure is conformal.\nFor manifolds of dimension at least 3, similar results have been obtained in [37, 28, 48, 75],\nand a 2-dimensional version is sketched in [24], but the above theorem covers a wider class\nof Cartan connections than in these references, a generalization which is vital for our\napplications in submanifold geometry.\n\n\f6\n\nFRANCIS E. BURSTALL AND DAVID M. J. CALDERBANK\n\nAn immediate consequence of this theorem is a canonical way to normalize a non-normal\nconformal Cartan geometry, a procedure which will be very important in the rest of the\npaper. We discuss some further ramifications in sections 6\u20137: we provide a more explicit\nanalysis of M\u00f6bius structures for curves and surfaces, relating them to the schwarzian\nderivative; we discuss the gauge theory and moduli of conformal Cartan connections; and\nwe revisit the flat model to discuss spaceform geometries and symmetry breaking.\nIn the second part of the paper, we apply the formalism of Part I to submanifolds of\nconformal manifolds. We emphasise a gauge-theoretic point of view, but use vector bundles\nand connections rather than frames and matrices of 1-forms. Although the latter are more\nelementary, the choice of frame can obscure the geometry and lead to large and complicated\nmatrices in applications. Without frames, the theory has conceptual simplicity: some\ninvestment is needed to master the abstraction, but the payoff is a uniform and efficient\ncalculus which adapts geometrically to almost any application.\nAs in Part I, we give two approaches, one emphasising bundles and connections, the\nother, more primitive homological data, and we relate these points of view. In sections 8\u20139,\nwe show how such a submanifold inherits a conformal M\u00f6bius structure from the ambient\ngeometry. We first study how M\u00f6bius structures on the submanifold are induced by a choice\nof 'M\u00f6bius reduction', then we show that Lie algebra homology distinguishes a canonical\nM\u00f6bius reduction (cf. [70]) and hence obtain a canonical induced conformal M\u00f6bius structure on the submanifold. This leads to canonical Gauss\u2013Codazzi\u2013Ricci equations relating\nthe curvature of these induced M\u00f6bius structures to the ambient space.\nIn the case of submanifolds of the conformal sphere S n , a M\u00f6bius reduction is the same\nthing as a sphere congruence enveloped by the submanifold, which are of great interest\nin their own right, although we postpone a detailed studied of sphere congruences per\nse to a sequel to this paper [14]. The canonical M\u00f6bius reduction in this case is the\ncentral sphere congruence of W. Blaschke and G. Thomsen [8] or the conformal Gauss\nmap of Bryant [10, 11]. We show that the minimal data characterizing the submanifold\n(locally, up to M\u00f6bius transformation) are certain Lie algebra homology classes satisfying\nnatural homological Gauss\u2013Codazzi\u2013Ricci equations. These equations encode the flatness\nof the ambient conformal Cartan connection of S n , meaning that the immersion can be\nreconstructed (locally, up to M\u00f6bius transformation) from the Gauss\u2013Codazzi\u2013Ricci data.\nThus we obtain, in section 10, an analogue of the classical Bonnet theorem.\nTheorem. An m-manifold \u03a3 can be locally immersed in S n with a given induced conformal M\u00f6bius structure, connection on the weightless normal bundle and tracefree second\nfundamental form (or conformal acceleration for m = 1) if and only if these data satisfy\nthe homological Gauss\u2013Codazzi\u2013Ricci equations. Moreover, in this case, the immersion is\nunique up to a M\u00f6bius transformation of S n .\nIn section 11 we introduce ambient Weyl structures along a submanifold and use them\nto give explicit formulae for the operators entering into the homological Gauss\u2013Codazzi\u2013\nRicci equations. Then, in section 12, we specialize this result first to curves, for which\nwe compute some M\u00f6bius invariants, and then to surfaces, where we relate our conformal\nBonnet theorem to the explicit approach of [21], developed by the first author and his\ncoworkers at the same time as our general theory. Finally we sketch the relation of our\napproach to the quaternionic formalism for surfaces in S 4 \u223c\n= HP 1 expounded in [18].\nThe third part of the paper concerns applications, with a view to demonstrating the\nspeed and effectiveness of our formalism once the machinery is in place. In section 13,\nwe show how the most basic aspects of conformal submanifold geometry, such as totally\numbilic submanifolds and channel submanifolds, have straightforward treatments in our\n\n\fCONFORMAL SUBMANIFOLD GEOMETRY I\u2013III\n\n7\n\napproach. We also discuss symmetry breaking and give an almost computation-free proof\nof Dupin's Theorem on orthogonal coordinates.\nIn sections 14\u201316, we apply our methods to constrained Willmore surfaces, isothermic\nsurfaces, Guichard surfaces and conformally flat submanifolds with flat normal bundle,\nwhich all find their natural home in conformal M\u00f6bius geometry and have in common an\nintegrable systems interpretation: the Gauss\u2013Codazzi\u2013Ricci data come in one parameter\nfamilies, leading to spectral deformations and a family of flat connections, which we derive straightforwardly in arbitrary codimension. For Willmore and constrained Willmore\nsurfaces, we show that the well-known relation with harmonicity of the central sphere\ncongruence has a homological interpretation. We also demonstrate easily that products\nof curves, constant mean curvature surfaces, generalized H-surfaces, and quadrics are all\nisothermic, and we compute the spectral deformation for products of curves.\nIn section 16, we turn to a class of submanifolds in in arbitrary dimension and codimension, which we call M\u00f6bius-flat: if the dimension is 3 or more and the codimension is\none, this is the well known theory of conformally-flat hypersurfaces, and in higher codimension, we simply add flatness of the normal bundle as an extra hypothesis. However,\nwe also present a new 2-dimensional theory, which unifies conformally flat submanifolds\nwith channel surfaces and the surfaces of Guichard [49, 23]. In this theory, we suppose\nthat the surface (with flat normal bundle) envelopes a sphere congruence for which the\ninduced normal Cartan connection (or equivalently, the induced conformal M\u00f6bius structure) is flat. When the sphere congruence is the central sphere congruence, this means\nthat the canonically induced M\u00f6bius curvature of the surface (which is an analogue of the\nCotton\u2013York curvature of conformal 3-manifolds) is zero, and we say the surface is strictly\nM\u00f6bius-flat, whereas in general, this curvature is the exterior derivative of a quadratic\ndifferential commuting with the shape operators, which we call a commuting Cotton\u2013York\npotential. In codimension one, the strictly M\u00f6bius-flat surfaces are Dupin cyclides (orbits\nof a two dimensional abelian subgroup of the M\u00f6bius group), and we obtain a transparent\nconformally-invariant derivation of their properties and classification. M\u00f6bius-flat surfaces\nin general have a much richer theory: in particular, as we prove, since they include the\nGuichard surfaces, they also include the surfaces of constant gaussian curvature in a spaceform, just as higher dimensional submanifolds of constant gaussian (sectional) curvature\nin a spaceform are conformally-flat. In a subsequent paper we shall show that the classical transformation theory of Guichard surfaces extends to M\u00f6bius-flat submanifolds in\narbitrary dimension and codimension.\nAcknowledgements.

Notation presents significant difficulties in this work, since there\nare many different geometric objects which can be constructed from each other in various\nways. In this paper the Reader will find the following constructions:\n\u2022 a conformal Cartan connection DV from an enveloped sphere congruence V ;\n\n\f8\n\nFRANCIS E. BURSTALL AND DAVID M. J. CALDERBANK\n\n\u2022 a M\u00f6bius structure MD from a conformal Cartan connection D;\n\u2022 a normalized Ricci curvature r D,M from a M\u00f6bius structure M and a Weyl derivative D.\n\nCombining these constructions could lead to unreadable superscripts, so we have adopted\nthe policy of omitting intermediate steps whenever this causes no confusion, leading to\nnotations such as MV and r D,V . We hope that our preference for less decorated notation\nis more a help to the Reader than a hindrance.\nPart I. Conformal M\u00f6bius Geometry\nIn the first part of our paper, we provide a complete theory of the intrinsic conformal\ngeometry that we shall use to study conformal submanifold geometry in the later parts. Although conformal geometry is well-established, our theory has many novelties, in particular\nthe notion of a M\u00f6bius structure, which allows us to describe, in intrinsic terms, the geometry of the large class of conformal Cartan connections that arise in submanifold geometry.\nWe also hope that it is a helpful treatment for several kinds of Reader, from the representation theorist to the riemannian geometer, because of the complementary approaches\nprovided by the A and B sections. Let us describe their contents in more detail.\nIn \u00a71A, we introduce conformal Cartan connections (V, \u039b, D) as curved versions of the\nmodel for conformal geometry, the celestial sphere or projective lightcone in Minkowski\nspace. The conformal structure induced by such connections motivate the first ingredient\nof the bottom-up approach, the conformal metric, which we discuss in \u00a71B, together with\nthe disarmingly simple notion of densities, which render unnecessary the use of riemannian\nmetrics in the conformal class.\nAlgebra in conformal geometry is more subtle than in riemannian geometry, because the\nstabilizer of a point (a lightline) in the model is not reductive, but a parabolic subgroup\nof the conformal (or M\u00f6bius) group, which is essentially the isometry group of Minkowski\nspace. Fortunately there is an algebraic machine, called Lie algebra homology, which relates\nrepresentations of this parabolic group to its reductive part, the Levi factor, which is here\nthe conformal linear group. We discuss this for the filtered Lie algebra so(V ) in \u00a72A, then\nfor its associated graded algebra T M \u2295 co(T M ) \u2295 T \u2217M in \u00a72B.\nWe then introduce Weyl derivatives, i.e., covariant derivatives on density line bundles.\nIn \u00a73A, we show that they induce splittings of the filtration of V and hence a curvature\ndecomposition and a gauge theory. In \u00a73B, we see that they induce torsion-free conformal\nconnections and curvature, whose dependence on the Weyl derivative we describe.\nIn \u00a74A, we introduce a natural differential lift from 1-densities to sections of V and use\nit to define two second order M\u00f6bius operators, one linear, one quadratic, associated to a\nconformal Cartan connection. In \u00a74B, we show that similar operators exist naturally on\nany conformal manifold of dimension n > 3, and introduce M\u00f6bius structures, which cover\nsuch operators in generality as well as allowing us to describe the natural ones.\nWe combine our two threads in section 5, where we construct a conformal Cartan connection from a M\u00f6bius structure and prove that this leads to an equivalence, so that the\nnatural affine structure on the space of M\u00f6bius structures can be lifted to the space of\nconformal Cartan connections, providing a way to 'normalize' such a connection.\nIn section 6, we discuss how to compute the M\u00f6bius structure from the Cartan connection, particularly in dimensions one and two, where the M\u00f6bius structure can be reinterpreted as a real or (perhaps non-holomorphic) complex projective structure, and hence\nrelated to schwarzian derivatives, cf. [21, 24].\nSection 7 is concerned with further consequences of our main result. In \u00a77.1 we describe\nthe moduli space of conformal Cartan geometries inducing a given conformal metric. In \u00a77.2\nwe revisit the model geometry of S n to relate it to the flat M\u00f6bius structure of euclidean\n\n\fCONFORMAL SUBMANIFOLD GEOMETRY I\u2013III\n\n9\n\nspace and other spaceform geometries. This sort of symmetry breaking often shows up in\nsubmanifold geometry, and in \u00a77.3 we end Part I with a general version of such phenomena.\n1. Conformal geometry\n1A. The sphere and conformal Cartan connections. The flat conformal structure on\nthe n-sphere arises most naturally by viewing it not as the round sphere S n in the euclidean\nspace Rn+1 , but as the celestial sphere S n in the lorentzian spacetime Rn+1,1 [38]. Recall\nthat Rn+1,1 is real vector space of dimension n + 2 with a nondegenerate inner product\n(* , *) of signature (n + 1, 1). Inside Rn+1,1 , we distinguish the light-cone L:\nL = {v \u2208 Rn+1,1 r {0} : (v, v) = 0},\n\nwhich is a submanifold of Rn+1,1 .\nClearly, if v \u2208 L and r \u2208 R\u00d7 then rv \u2208 L, so that R\u00d7 acts freely on L and we may take\nthe quotient P(L) \u2282 P(Rn+1,1 ):\nP(L) = L/R\u00d7 \u223c\n= {U \u2282 Rn+1,1 : U is a 1-dimensional null subspace},\n\nwhich is a smooth n-sphere. The projection q : L \u2192 P(L) is an R\u00d7 -bundle over P(L),\nwhich may be viewed as the nonzero vectors in a tautological line bundle \u039b over P(L): \u039b\nis defined to be the subbundle of the trivial bundle P(L) \u00d7Rn+1,1 whose fibre at U \u2208 P(L)\nis U itself, viewed as a null line in Rn+1,1 . It is convenient to orient \u039b, by choosing one of\nthe components L+ of L: this choice is equivalently a 'time-orientation' of Rn+1,1 .\nNote that T L \u223c\n= q \u2217 \u039b\u22a5 \u2282 L \u00d7 Rn+1,1 with vertical bundle q \u2217 \u039b. Hence the differential d\u03c3\nof a section \u03c3 of L+ \u2282 \u039b can be viewed \u039b\u22a5 -valued 1-form on P(L) such that d\u03c3 mod \u039b is\nan isomorphism T P(L) \u2192 \u039b\u22a5 /\u039b. This isomorphism is clearly algebraic and linear in \u03c3, so\nthere is a canonical isomorphism T P(L) \u039b \u223c\n= \u039b\u22a5 /\u039b. Here, and in the following, we omit\ntensor product signs when tensoring with line bundles.\nSince \u039b\u22a5 /\u039b inherits a metric from Rn+1,1 , each positive section \u03c3 defines a metric on\nP(L) by X, Y 7\u2192 (dX \u03c3, dY \u03c3). Rescaling \u03c3 evidently gives a conformally equivalent metric,\nand this equips P(L) with a conformal structure. In particular, by considering the conic\nsections of \u039b \u2282 P(L) \u00d7Rn+1,1 given by (v, \u03c3) = k for fixed v \u2208 Rn+1,1 and k \u2208 R\u00d7 , one sees\nthat this conformal structure is flat (cf. \u00a77.2).\nThe beauty of this model is that it linearizes conformal geometry. Let O + (n + 1, 1) be\nthe group of Lorentz transformations of Rn+1,1 preserving the time orientation. Then the\nlinear action of O + (n + 1, 1) on Rn+1,1 preserves L and so descends to an action on P(L).\nSince the metric on \u039b\u22a5 /\u039b is preserved, O + (n + 1, 1) acts by conformal diffeomorphisms\non P(L) and this gives an isomorphism between O + (n + 1, 1) and the group M\u00f6b(n) of\nM\u00f6bius transformations of S n = P(L) (which are the global conformal diffeomorphisms for\nn > 2 and the projective transformations of S 1 \u223c\n= RP 1 for n = 1). M\u00f6b(n) acts transitively\non P(L) with stabilizer a parabolic subgroup P \u223c\n= CO(n) \u22c9 Rn\u2217 , which identifies S n with\nM\u00f6b(n)/P , a generalized flag variety. Note that signature (k + 1, 1) linear subspaces of\nRn+1,1 give the conformal k-spheres in S n by intersecting with L-see \u00a78.3 for more details.\nA conformal manifold is a 'curved version' of S n : curved versions of homogeneous spaces\nare usually defined as Cartan connections on principal bundles; however, since we have\ndescribed the flat model linearly, using flat differentiation on P(L) \u00d7 Rn+1,1 , we shall also\ndescribe conformal Cartan connections linearly, cf. [3, 29, 48, 75].\nDefinition 1.1. A conformal Cartan connection on an n-manifold M is defined by:\n\u2022 the Cartan vector bundle V , a rank n + 2 vector bundle with a signature (n + 1, 1)\nlorentzian metric on each fibre;\n\u2022 the tautological line \u039b, an oriented (so trivializable) null line subbundle of V ;\n\n\f10\n\nFRANCIS E. BURSTALL AND DAVID M. J. CALDERBANK\n\n\u2022 the Cartan connection D, a metric connection on V satisfying the following Cartan\ncondition: the soldering form \u03b2 D : T M \u2192 Hom(\u039b, \u039b\u22a5 /\u039b), defined by\n\n(1.1)\n\nD\n\u03b2X\n\u03c3 = \u2212DX \u03c3 mod \u039b\n\nfor any section \u03c3 of \u039b and any vector field X, is a bundle isomorphism. (This makes\nsense because the right hand side is algebraic in \u03c3 \u2297 X, as it is for M = P(L), D = d.)\n\nOur data equip V and M with structures intertwined by the soldering form \u03b2 D . Our\nfirst observation is that the lorentzian metric on V induces a conformal metric on M ,\ngeneralizing the case M = P(L). For this, we denote by L+ the positive ray subbundle\nof \u039b, and a section \u03c3 of L+ (i.e., a positive section of \u039b) will be called a gauge. We then\nobtain a conformal class of metrics on M defined by X, Y 7\u2192 (DX \u03c3, DY \u03c3) for each gauge \u03c3.\nIn more invariant terms, we can write (DX \u03c3, DY \u03c3) = hX, Y i\u03c3 2 , where hX, Y i is a fibrewise\ninner product on T M with values in (\u039b\u2217)2 which is independent of the choice of gauge.\nProposition 1.2. [37] The celestial n-sphere S n = P(L) is naturally equipped with a flat\nconformal Cartan connection. Conversely, if M is equipped with a flat conformal Cartan\nconnection, then M is locally isomorphic to S n .\nProof. We take V = P(L) \u00d7 Rn+1,1 , with the constant lorentzian metric, the tautological\nnull line subbundle, and flat differentiation. We have already seen that the Cartan condition\nholds, and RD = 0 by definition.\nConversely, if D is flat, then the inclusion \u039b \u2192 V defines a map \u03a6 from each simply\nconnected open subset \u03a9 of M to the space of parallel null lines in V |\u03a9 , which is diffeomorphic to S n . By the Cartan condition, \u03a6 is a local diffeomorphism. Furthermore \u03a6 clearly\nidentifies \u039b with the tautological line bundle over S n , and D with the trivial connection on\nS n \u00d7 Rn+1,1 . In particular \u03a6 is conformal.\n\u0003\n\nThe same argument will be used later to obtain an immersion into S n in the proof of\nthe Bonnet theorem for conformal submanifolds.\n\nRemark 1.3. A Cartan connection in the usual sense (see [26, 70]), modelled on a homogeneous space G/P , is a principal G-bundle C equipped with a principal G-connection \u03c9\nand a reduction G \u2282 C to a principal P -bundle such that \u03c9|G mod p : T G \u2192 g/p is an\nisomorphism on each tangent space. When G = M\u00f6b(n) and G/P = S n , it is easy to see\nthat this induces a conformal Cartan connection on the bundle associated to the standard\nrepresentation Rn+1,1 of G \u223c\n= O + (n + 1, 1), and this linear representation suffices to recover\nthe original Cartan connection.\n1B. Densities and conformal metrics. In \u00a71A, we obtained the conformal class of\nriemannian metrics on S n from gauges, i.e., sections of L+ \u2282 \u039b. This is an entirely general\nphenomenon: a conformal structure on a manifold M is an oriented line subbundle of\nS 2 T \u2217M whose positive sections are riemannian metrics (i.e., positive definite). One small\ndifficulty with such a definition is that each conformal structure has its own line bundle.\nHowever, we can resolve this by relating any such line bundle to the density bundle of M .\nIf E is a real n-dimensional vector space and w any real number, then the oriented one\nw/n of GL(E)\ndimensional linear space Lw = Lw\nE carrying the representation A 7\u2192 | det A|\nis called the space of densities of weight w or w-densities. This space can be constructed\ncanonically from E as the space of maps\n\u03bb : (\u2227n E) r {0} \u2192 R such that \u03bb(rA) = |r|\u2212w/n \u03bb(A) for all r \u2208 R\u00d7 , A \u2208 (\u2227n E) r {0}.\n\nNote that the modulus of \u03c9 \u2208 \u2227n E \u2217 is an element |\u03c9| of L\u2212n defined by |\u03c9|(A) = |\u03c9(A)|.\nThe density line bundle Lw = Lw\nT M on an n-dimensional manifold M is the bundle whose\nw\nfibre at x \u2208 M is LTx M . This is the associated bundle GL(M ) \u00d7GL(n) Lw (n) to the frame\n\n\fCONFORMAL SUBMANIFOLD GEOMETRY I\u2013III\n\n11\n\nbundle GL(M ), where Lw (n) is the space of w-densities of Rn . The density bundles are\noriented real line bundles, but there is no preferred trivialization unless w = 0.\nProposition 1.4. Let \u039b\u2297 \u039b be a line subbundle of S 2 T \u2217M , with \u039b oriented, whose positive\nsections are nondegenerate. Then there is a canonical oriented isomorphism \u039b \u2192 L\u22121 .\n\nProof. The inclusion of \u039b2 := \u039b \u2297 \u039b into S 2 T \u2217M is a section of S 2 T \u2217M (\u039b2 )\u2217 = S 2 (T M \u039b)\u2217,\nand this defines a nondegenerate metric on T M \u039b by assumption. The modulus of the\nvolume form of this metric is a positive section of L\u2212n (\u039b\u2217 )n , and the positive nth root of\n\u0003\nthis, a section of L\u22121 \u039b\u2217 \u223c\n= Hom(\u039b, L\u22121 ), is the isomorphism we seek.\nThis proposition tells us that we may view the conformal structure as a section of\nS 2 T \u2217M L2 . The sections we obtain in this way are not arbitrary, but normalized by the condition that the modulus of their volume form is the canonical section 1 of L\u2212n Ln = M \u00d7R.\nDefinition 1.5. [75] A conformal metric on M is a normalized metric c on the weightless\ntangent bundle T M L\u22121 . It induces an inner product h* , *i on T M with values in L2 .\nThe use of densities allows a simple geometric dimensional analysis for tensors [40, 80].\nSections of L = L1 may be thought of as scalar fields with dimensions of length: a positive section l defines a length scale. The tensor bundle Lw \u2297 (T M )j \u2297 (T \u2217M )k (and any\nsubbundle, quotient bundle, element or section) will be said to have weight w + j \u2212 k.\nA conformal metric c is weightless, and we shall use it freely to 'raise and lower indices'\nwith the proviso that the weight of tensors is preserved. For example, a 1-form \u03b3 is identified\nin this way with a vector field of weight \u22121, that is, a section of T M L\u22122 . Where necessary\nfor clarity, we denote this isomorphism and its inverse by \u266f and \u266d in the usual way.\n2. Conformal algebra\n2A. The filtered Lie algebra bundle. Let (V, \u039b, D) be a conformal Cartan connection\non M . The filtration 0 \u2282 \u039b \u2282 \u039b\u22a5 \u2282 V induces a filtration of the Lie algebra bundle so(V ):\nwhere\n\n0 \u2282 so(V )\u22121 \u2282 so(V )0 \u2282 so(V )1 = so(V ),\n\nso(V )\u22121 = {S \u2208 so(V ) : S|\u039b = 0, S(\u039b\u22a5 ) \u2286 \u039b},\nso(V )0 = {S \u2208 so(V ) : S(\u039b) \u2286 \u039b}.\n\nHence so(V )0 is the stabilizer stab(\u039b) of \u039b, which is a bundle of parabolic subalgebras,\nwhereas so(V )\u22121 is the Killing annihilator stab(\u039b)\u22a5 , which is the bundle of (abelian) nilradicals of stab(\u039b). By definition, for S \u2208 stab(\u039b)\u22a5 , S|\u039b\u22a5 has image and kernel \u039b, and it\nis easy to see that this restriction defines an isomorphism stab(\u039b)\u22a5 \u223c\n= Hom(\u039b\u22a5 /\u039b, \u039b).\nThese filtrations give rise to a bundle\nso(V )gr = so(V )\u22121 \u2295 so(V )0 / so(V )\u22121 \u2295 so(V )1 / so(V )0\n\nof graded Lie algebras acting on the bundle Vgr = \u039b \u2295 \u039b\u22a5 /\u039b \u2295 V /\u039b\u22a5 of graded lorentzian\nvector spaces. Only so(V )0 / so(V )\u22121 preserves the grading, and this defines an isomorphism\nso(V )0 / so(V )\u22121 \u223c\n= so(\u039b \u2295 V /\u039b\u22a5 ) \u2295 so(\u039b\u22a5 /\u039b). On the other hand, restriction to \u039b defines\nan isomorphism from so(V )/ so(V )0 to Hom(\u039b, \u039b\u22a5 /\u039b).\nThe key point now is that the soldering form allows us to identify each graded component\nof Vgr , and hence of so(Vgr ), with a natural vector bundle on M . For this, begin by noting\nthat \u03b2 D : T M \u2192 Hom(\u039b, \u039b\u22a5 /\u039b) naturally induces an isomorphism T M \u039b \u223c\n= \u039b\u22a5 /\u039b. As in\n\u00a71B (cf. Proposition 1.4) the conformal metric induces an identification \u039b \u223c\n= L\u22121 , which\n\u22a5\n\u22121\nwe shall use freely. We thus have a projection \u03c0 : \u039b \u2192 T M L , with kernel \u039b, given by\n(2.1)\n\n\u03c0DX \u03c3 = \u2212X \u2297 \u03c3.\n\n\f12\n\nFRANCIS E. BURSTALL AND DAVID M. J.

The projections p and \u03c0 onto graded pieces, which we introduced for V , have\nanalogues for so(V ) making these identifications explicit: p : so(V ) \u2192 T M , with kernel\nstab(\u039b) is defined by (pS) \u2297 \u03c3 = \u03c0(S\u03c3) for S \u2208 so(V ); \u03c0 : stab(\u039b) \u2192 co(T M ), with kernel\nstab(\u039b)\u22a5 , is defined (\u03c0S) \u25e6 p = p \u25e6 S and (\u03c0S) \u25e6 \u03c0 = \u03c0 \u25e6 S|\u039b\u22a5 for S \u2208 stab(\u039b).

Hence (\u2227\u2022 T \u2217M \u2297 W, \u2202) is a chain complex, and we denote its cycles\nby Z\u2022 (T \u2217M, W ) and its homology, called Lie algebra homology, by H\u2022 (T \u2217M, W ).\nWe shall only be interested in the cases W = V and W = so(V ). In particular let us\ncompute Z1 (T \u2217M, V ): if \u03b1 \u2208 T \u2217M \u2297 V with \u2202\u03b1 = 0 then, in particular, from (2.7),\nP\n0 = \u03c0\u2202\u03b1 = i \u03b5i \u2297 p(\u03b1ei )\nwhence \u03b1 takes values in \u039b\u22a5 .

The graded Lie algebra bundle. On any manifold M , the Lie algebra bundle of\nendomorphisms gl(T M ) acts fibrewise on the density bundle L via A * l = ( n1 tr A)l and\nhence also on S 2 T \u2217M L2 . The stabilizer of a conformal metric c is the bundle of conformal\nlinear Lie algebras co(T M ). Thus A \u2208 co(T M ) if and only if\nhAX, Y i + hX, AY i = n2 (tr A)hX, Y i.\n\nThe Lie bracket on co(T M ) can be extended to one on T \u2217M \u2295 co(T M ) \u2295 T M : declare T M\nand T \u2217M to be abelian subalgebras and, for (\u03b3, A, X) \u2208 T \u2217M \u2295 co(T M ) \u2295 T M , set\n(2.10)\n\n[[A, X]] = AX,\n\n[[\u03b3, A]] = \u03b3 \u25e6 A;\n\nfinally define [[X, \u03b3]] = \u2212[[\u03b3, X]] \u2208 gl(T M ) by\n(2.11)\n\n[[X, \u03b3]] * Y = \u2212[[\u03b3, X]] * Y = \u03b3(X)Y + \u03b3(Y )X \u2212 hX, Y i\u03b3 \u266f .\n\nObserve that [[X, \u03b3]] \u2208 co(T M ) with tr[[X, \u03b3]] = n\u03b3(X) and [[X, \u03b3]] * Y = [[Y, \u03b3]] * X.\nDefine an inner product of signature (n + 1, 1) on L\u22121 \u2295 T \u2217M L \u2295 L by setting\n(v, v) = h\u03b8, \u03b8i \u2212 2\u03c3l,\n\nfor v = (\u03c3, \u03b8, l).

It follows that the above\ngraded Lie algebra structure on T \u2217M \u2295 co(T M ) \u2295 T M is precisely that induced by the\nfiltered Lie algebra structure on so(V ). Hence for all S\u22121 \u2208 so(V )\u22121 = stab(\u039b)\u22a5 , S0 , T0 \u2208\nso(V )0 = stab(\u039b) and T \u2208 so(V ), we have p[S0 , T ] = [[\u03c0S0 , pT ]], \u03c0[S0 , T0 ] = [[\u03c0S0 , \u03c0T0 ]],\np[S\u22121 , T ] = [[S\u22121 , pT ]] and \u03c0[S\u22121 , T0 ] = [[S\u22121 , \u03c0T0 ]]. We shall use these formulae freely.\nAs in \u00a72A, we may define Lie algebra homology, but now the operator \u2202 is also graded\nand may be restricted to graded pieces. To analyse this, we fix a length scale l and define\nan involution v 7\u2192 v \u2217 = (\u2212\u03bbl\u22122 , \u03b8, \u2212\u03c3l2 ), where v = (\u03c3, \u03b8, \u03bb) \u2208 L\u22121 \u2295 T \u2217M L \u2295 L, so\nthat hv, vi := (v \u2217 , v) = h\u03b8, \u03b8i + \u03bb2 l\u22122 + \u03c3 2 l2 is positive definite2 on V . We further define\nS 7\u2192 S \u2217 = \u2212(X \u266d l\u22122 , AT , \u03b3 \u266f l2 ), for S = (\u03b3, A, X) \u2208 T \u2217M \u2295 co(T M ) \u2295 T M , where the\nmusical isomorphisms are induced by g. We compute that (S * v)\u2217 = S \u2217 * v \u2217 and hence\n[[S, T ]]\u2217 = [[S \u2217 , T \u2217 ]]. Further, hS, Si := (S \u2217 , S) is positive definite, where (S, S) is the\ninvariant inner product of signature ( 21 n(n + 1), n + 1) on T \u2217M \u2295 co(T M ) \u2295 T M given by\n(S, S) = hA0 , A0 i \u2212 \u03bc2 \u2212 2\u03b3(X)\n\nfor S = (\u03b3, A, X) and A = \u03bc id + A0 with A0 \u2208 so(T M ). It follows that S 7\u2192 S \u2217 is a Cartan\ninvolution of the graded Lie algebra, as in Kostant's celebrated paper [59]. Following this\n2For indefinite signature conformal structures, we further need a choice of maximal positive definite\n\nsubbundle of T M to define such an involution.\n\n\f14\n\nFRANCIS E.

This is a special case of the operator w 7\u2192 id \u2227* w :=\nP\n\u2217\ni \u03b5i \u2227 (ei * w), defined on any representation W of T M \u2295 co(T M ) \u2295 T M , independently of\nany choice of length scale. Note however, that it is not naturally defined on representations\nof the filtered Lie algebra so(V ).\nWe shall be particularly interested in the Ricci contraction \u2202 : \u22272 T \u2217M \u2297 co(T M ) \u2192\n\u2217\nT M \u2297 T \u2217M given by \u2202 : R 7\u2192 ric, with\nP\nP\nric X (Y ) = i [[\u03b5i , Rei ,X ]](Y ) = i \u03b5i (Rei ,X Y ),\nand the Ricci map r 7\u2192 [[id \u2227 r]] : T \u2217M \u2297 T \u2217M \u2192 \u22272 T \u2217M \u2297 co(T M ), where [[id \u2227 r]]X,Y =\n[[X, rY ]] \u2212 [[Y, rX ]]. As a special case of the above theory, the Ricci contraction is minus\nthe adjoint of the Ricci map (using any fixed length scale l). In particular, the kernel\nof the Ricci contraction and the image of the Ricci map (and vice versa) are orthogonal\ncomplements with respect to h, i. Moreover, \u2202[[id \u2227 r]] is readily computed to be\n\u0001\n(2.13)\n(n \u2212 2) sym0 r + 2(n \u2212 1) n1 tr c r c + n2 alt r\n\nfrom which we see that the Ricci map is injective when n > 3, has kernel S02 T \u2217M when\nn = 2, and is zero for n = 1. (Here (alt r)X Y = rX Y \u2212 rY X.)\n3. Weyl geometry\n\nA popular approach in conformal geometry is to work with a riemannian metric in the\nconformal class. This amounts to fixing a length scale l, or equivalently, in the context of\nconformal Cartan connections, a gauge \u03c3. However, choosing a different metric leads to\ncomplicated transformation formulae, so we find it convenient to use a more general notion.\nFor this, note that a length scale is parallel with respect to a unique connection on L.\nDefinition 3.1. A Weyl derivative on M is a connection on L. It induces a covariant\nderivative D on Lw for each w \u2208 R, whose curvature is a real 2-form wF D , the Faraday\ncurvature. If F D = 0 then D is said to be closed: then there are local length scales l with\nDl = 0; if such an l exists globally then D is said to be exact. Any two Weyl derivatives\ndiffer by a 1-form so that Weyl derivatives are an affine space modelled on \u03a91 (M, R).\nIn this section we relate Weyl derivatives to conformal Cartan connections and conformal\nmetrics, cf. [25, 26, 27, 32, 40, 48, 80].\n3A. Weyl structures.\nDefinition 3.2. Let (V, \u039b, D) be a conformal Cartan connection. Then a Weyl structure\nis a null line subbundle \u039b\u0302 of V complementary to \u039b\u22a5 (i.e., distinct from \u039b).\nObserve that \u039b\u22a5 \u2229 \u039b\u0302\u22a5 is a complementary subspace to \u039b in \u039b\u22a5 . Conversely given such a\ncomplement U , there is a unique null line subbundle \u039b\u0302 orthogonal to U and complementary\nto \u039b\u22a5 . Thus a Weyl structure is given equivalently by a splitting pr \u039b\u0302 of the inclusion\n\u039b \u2192 \u039b\u22a5 . It follows that Weyl structures form an affine space modelled on the space of\nsections of Hom(\u039b\u22a5 /\u039b, \u039b) \u223c\n= stab(\u039b)\u22a5 , with pr \u039b\u0302+\u03b3 (v) = pr \u039b\u0302 (v)+\u03b3 * v. This affine structure\nhas a gauge-theoretic interpretation that we wish to emphasise: \u039b\u0302 + \u03b3 = exp(\u2212\u03b3)\u039b\u0302.\nA Weyl structure defines a covariant derivative D = pr \u039b\u0302 \u25e6D|\u039b on \u039b, and so a Weyl\nderivative via the usual identification \u039b \u223c\n= L\u22121 provided by the conformal structure. Conversely, given a Weyl derivative and so a covariant derivative D on \u039b, we take U to be the\nimage of DD i\u039b : T M \u2297 \u039b \u2192 \u039b\u22a5 , where i\u039b : \u039b \u2192 V is the inclusion and DD is the induced\n\n\fCONFORMAL SUBMANIFOLD GEOMETRY I\u2013III\n\n15\n\nconnection on Hom(\u039b, V ): this is a complement to \u039b since \u03c0 \u25e6 DD i\u039b = \u2212id T M \u039b . Thus we\nhave a bijection D 7\u2192 \u039b\u0302D between Weyl derivatives and Weyl structures which, in view of\nthe soldering identification T \u2217M \u223c\n= Hom(\u039b\u22a5 /\u039b, \u039b) enunciated in (2.3), is easily seen to be\nD+\u03b3\nD\naffine: \u039b\u0302\n= \u039b\u0302 + \u03b3.\nRemark 3.3. There is yet another (equivalent) definition of Weyl structure that really gets\nto the Lie-theoretic heart of the matter. The decomposition V = \u039b \u2295 U \u2295 \u039b\u0302 is equivalently\ngiven by an element \u03b5 \u2208 so(V ) which acts by \u22121 on \u039b, 0 on U and 1 on \u039b\u0302. It is easy to\nsee that \u03b5 \u2208 stab(\u039b) is a lift of the identity in co(T M ) \u223c\n= stab(\u039b)/ stab(\u039b)\u22a5 and conversely\nany such lift splits the filtration of V . See [26] for more on this approach.\nThe decomposition V = \u039b \u2295 U \u2295 \u039b\u0302 induced by a Weyl structure identifies V with Vgr so\nthat we have an isomorphism V \u223c\n= L\u22121 \u2295 T \u2217M L \u2295 L. Hence we also obtain an isomorphism\n\u2217\n\u223c\nso(V ) = T M \u2295co(T M )\u2295T M between the Lie algebra bundles of section 2. (Note however,\nthat different Weyl structures give rise to different isomorphisms!)\nThese decompositions (a reduction of the structure group of V to CO(n)) induce a\ndecomposition of the connection D into a T \u2217M -valued 1-form r D,D, a CO(n)-connection D D\n(restricting to the Weyl derivative D on L and L\u22121 and a metric connection on T \u2217M L), and\na T M -valued 1-form. This last is minus the soldering form which, with our identifications,\nis minus the identity. To summarize, if we write (\u03c3, \u03b8, l) for the components of v, we have\n\"\n#\nD,D\n(\u03b8)\nDX \u03c3 + rX\nD,D\nD\nD,D\nD\u03b8 + r\n(3.1)\nDX v = rX * v + DX v \u2212 X * v = DX\nl \u2212 \u03c3X .\nX\nDX l \u2212 \u03b8(X)\nIt is natural to ask how these components transform under a change \u039b\u0302 7\u2192 exp(\u2212\u03b3)\u039b\u0302 of\nWeyl structure. We first examine how D changes under gauge transformation by exp(\u03b3):\n(exp \u03b3 * D)X v = exp(\u03b3)DX (exp(\u2212\u03b3)v) differs from DX v by the right logarithmic derivative\nof the exponential map at \u03b3, in the direction DX \u03b3, applied to v. Using the standard formula\nd(Rexp(\u2212\u03b3) )exp \u03b3 \u25e6 d exp\u03b3 (\u03c7) = F (ad \u03b3)(\u03c7),\n\nF (t) = 1t (et \u2212 1) = 1 + 21 t + * * *\n\nfor this logarithmic derivative (see [58]), we then obtain\n\nexp \u03b3 * D = D \u2212 D\u03b3 \u2212 12 [[\u03b3, \u03c0D\u03b3]],\n\n(3.2)\n\nsince D\u03b3 is in stab(\u039b), on which ad \u03b3 is 2-step nilpotent, and hence F (ad \u03b3)(DX \u03b3) =\nDX \u03b3 + 12 [\u03b3, DX \u03b3]. We can expand [[\u03b3, \u03c0DX \u03b3]] = \u22122\u03b3(X)\u03b3 + h\u03b3, \u03b3iX \u266d explicitly as needed.\nThis computation provides the required transformation formulae by switching from the\nactive to passive view of gauge transformations: in the former, the connection is transformed but the 'gauge' (here a Weyl structure \u039b\u0302 \u2282 V ) is fixed; in the latter, the opposite\nprocess is performed. Since exp(\u03b3) acts trivially on so(V )gr , we deduce that the components\nr D,D and D D transform as follows:\n(3.3)\n(3.4)\n\n(D + \u03b3)D = D exp \u03b3*D = D D \u2212 [[\u03b3, *]]\n\nr D+\u03b3,D = r D,exp \u03b3*D = r D,D \u2212 D\u03b3 + \u03b3 \u2297 \u03b3 \u2212 21 h\u03b3, \u03b3ic.\n\nCurvature. We now compute the curvature of a conformal Cartan connection D with respect to a Weyl structure \u039b\u0302 \u2282 V . Using (3.1), i.e., D = r D,D + D D \u2212 id, we have\n(3.5)\n\nD\n\nD\n\nD\n\nRD = d D r D,D + RD \u2212 [[id \u2227 r D,D ]] \u2212 d D id.\nD\n\nThe last component, \u2212d D id, i.e., minus the torsion of D D , is equal to p(RD ), hence\nindependent of the Weyl structure, so we call it the torsion of D. We refer to W D :=\nD\nRD \u2212 [[id \u2227 r D,D ]] as the Weyl curvature of D (with respect to D or \u039b\u0302); if the torsion\nD\nof D is zero, W D = \u03c0(RD ), independently of \u039b\u0302. Finally C D,D := d D r D,D is called the\n\n\f16\n\nFRANCIS E. BURSTALL AND DAVID M. J. CALDERBANK\n\nCotton\u2013York curvature of D (with respect to \u039b\u0302); it is the full curvature (independent of \u039b\u0302)\nif both the torsion and Weyl curvature vanish.\nWe shall be interested in the following natural conditions on the curvature of D.\nDefinition 3.4. Let (V, \u039b, D) be a conformal Cartan connection. Then\n\u2022 D is torsion-free if p(RD ) = 0, i.e., RD \u2208 \u03a92 (M, stab(\u039b)), or equivalently RD \u039b \u2286 \u039b;\n\u2022 D is strongly torsion-free if RD |\u039b = 0;\n\u2022 D is normal if \u2202RD = 0.\nIn fact, a normal conformal Cartan connection is strongly torsion-free. For this, note\nthat \u0393 7\u2192 [[id \u2227 \u0393]] defines an isomorphism T \u2217M \u2297 so(T M ) \u2192 \u22272 T \u2217M \u2297 T M (this amounts\nto the familiar algebra that determines a metric connection from its torsion). Thus [[id \u2227(*)]]\nsurjects so that \u2202 : \u22272 T \u2217M \u2297 T M \u2192 T \u2217M \u2297 co(T M ) injects. Furthermore, it is easy to see\nthat also \u2202 : \u22272 T \u2217M \u2297 co(T \u03a3) \u2192 T \u2217M \u2297 T \u2217M injects on \u22272 T \u2217M \u2297 <id T M >.\nIf D is torsion-free, \u03c0(RD ) = W D . Thus D is normal iff it is torsion-free and \u2202W D = 0.\nWe can now single out the conformal Cartan connections that will be of interest to us.\nDefinition 3.5. A conformal Cartan geometry is a conformal Cartan connection (V, \u039b, D)\nwith D strongly torsion-free. It is said to be normal if D is normal.\n3B. Weyl connections.\nDefinition 3.6. Let c be a conformal metric on M . Then a Weyl connection is a torsionfree connection D on T M which is conformal in the sense that Dc = 0.\nIf l is a length scale, then the Levi-Civita connection D g of the metric g = l\u22122 c is a Weyl\nconnection: since g is parallel and l is parallel (with respect to the induced connection on L),\nso is c = l2 g. Any Weyl connection induces a Weyl derivative and Levi-Civita connections\ninduce exact Weyl derivatives. The existence and uniqueness of the Levi-Civita connection\nassociated to a length scale admits the following generalization [40, 48, 80].\nProposition 3.7. The affine map sending a connection on T M to the induced covariant\nderivative on L induces a bijection between Weyl connections and Weyl derivatives.\nIndeed, if D is a given Weyl connection (for example, the Levi-Civita of a compatible\nmetric), then any other such is of the form D + \u0393 where \u0393 is a co(T M )-valued 1-form with\n[[id \u2227 \u0393]] = 0. A standard argument shows that all such \u0393 are of the form \u0393 = [[id, \u03b3]] for a\nsection \u03b3 of T \u2217M and then the corresponding Weyl derivative on L is D + n1 tr \u0393 = D + \u03b3.\nOne of the reasons why Weyl derivatives can be more convenient than length scales is\nthat they form an affine space, modelled on \u03a91 (M, R). When we construct a geometric\nobject using a Weyl derivative D, we often want to know how it depends upon this choice.\nWe view such an object as a function F (D) and say that it is conformally-invariant if and\nonly if this function is constant (i.e., independent of D). For this, it is often helpful to use\nthe fundamental theorem of calculus: F (D) is constant iff its derivative with respect to\nD is zero. This amounts to checking that \u2202\u03b3 F (D) = 0 for all Weyl derivatives D and all\n1-forms \u03b3, i.e., that for any one parameter family D(t) with\nd\n=\u03b3\nD(t)\nD(0) = D and\ndt\nt=0\nd\n\u2202\u03b3 F (D) := F (D(t))\nwe have\n= 0.\ndt\nt=0\nk+1 F (D) = 0 for all D and \u03b3 then\nMore generally, Taylor's theorem implies that if \u2202\u03b3,...\u03b3\n2\nF (D) + * * * +\nF (D + \u03b3) = F (D) + \u2202\u03b3 F (D) + 12 \u2202\u03b3,\u03b3\n\n1 k\nk! \u2202\u03b3,...\u03b3 F (D).\n\nThis approach often simplifies the calculation of nonlinear terms.\n\n\fCONFORMAL SUBMANIFOLD GEOMETRY I\u2013III\n\n17\n\nFor example, for any section l of L, \u2202\u03b3 DX l = \u03b3(X)l and for any vector field Y , \u2202\u03b3 DX Y =\n[[X, \u03b3]] * Y . Similarly, if s is a section of a bundle associated to the conformal frame bundle,\nthen \u2202\u03b3 DX s = [[X, \u03b3]] * s where the dot denotes the natural action of co(T M ). This expresses\nthe obvious fact that all first covariant derivatives depend affinely on D.\nFor the second derivative, we obtain\n\u0001\n2\n\u2202\u03b3 DX,Y\ns = [[X, \u03b3]] * DY s \u2212 D[[X,\u03b3]]*Y s + DX [[Y, \u03b3]] * s \u2212 [[DX Y, \u03b3]] * s\n= [[Y, DX \u03b3]] * s + [[X, \u03b3]] * DY s + [[Y, \u03b3]] * DX s \u2212 D[[X,\u03b3]]*Y s\n\nIn particular, for any section l of L we have\n(3.6)\n\n2\nl = (DX \u03b3)(Y )l + hX, Y ih\u03b3, Dli.\n\u2202\u03b3 DX,Y\n\nCurvature. We now apply the transformation formula for the second derivative to the\ncurvature RD of the Weyl connection D, which is the co(T M )-valued 2-form such that\n2\n2 s = RD * s for any section s of any bundle associated to the conformal\nDX,Y\ns \u2212 DY,X\nX,Y\nframe bundle. We deduce that\n(3.7)\n\nD\n= \u2212[[X, DY \u03b3]] + [[Y, DX \u03b3]] = \u2212[[id \u2227 D\u03b3]]X,Y ,\n\u2202\u03b3 RX,Y\n\ni.e., \u2202\u03b3 RD = \u2212[[id \u2227 D\u03b3]]. Hence the part of RD orthogonal to the image of the Ricci\nmap is conformally-invariant: this is the Weyl curvature W of the conformal metric, and\nit has vanishing Ricci contraction: W itself vanishes for n < 4 since the Ricci map is then\nsurjective. On the other hand, for n > 3, the Ricci map is injective, and so we can write\nRD = W + [[id \u2227 r D ]],\n\n(3.8)\n\nwith r D uniquely determined by D and, in view of (3.7),\n\u2202\u03b3 r D = \u2212D\u03b3.\n\n(3.9)\n\nLet ric D be the Ricci contraction \u2202RD of RD , so that, by (2.13), we have\n(3.10)\n\nric D = (n \u2212 2) sym0 r D + 2(n \u2212 1)\n\n1\nn\n\ntr c r D )c +\n\nn\n2\n\nalt r D .\n\nA simple application of the Bianchi identity [[id\u2227RD ]] = 0 gives alt ric D = \u2212 tr RD = \u2212nF D\nand hence we deduce r D is the normalized Ricci curvature, defined by\nr D = r0D + n1 s D c \u2212 12 F D ,\n\nwhere we set\n\n1\n1\nsym0 ric D ,\nsD =\ntr c ric D .\nn\u22122\n2(n \u2212 1)\nWhen n = 3, d D r D is independent of D, and known as the Cotton\u2013York curvature of c.\nWhen n = 2, s D is still defined and the Ricci map is still injective on L\u22122 so that\nr0D =\n\n(3.11)\n\n\u2202\u03b3 s D = \u2212 tr c D\u03b3.\n\nWe wish to bring the cases n = 1 and n = 2 in to line with the higher dimensional case.\nOne way to do this uses a pair of differential operators, which we call a M\u00f6bius structure.\n4. M\u00f6bius manifolds\n4A. The differential lift and M\u00f6bius operators. A conformal Cartan connection\n(V, \u039b, D) induces more structure on M than just a conformal metric. This additional\nstructure arises from the following differential operator, cf. [25, 35].\nProposition 4.1. There is a unique linear map j D : C\u221e (M, L) \u2192 C\u221e (M, V ) such that\n\u2022 p(j D l) = l, i.e.,\nj D l is a lift of l with respect to the projection p : V \u2192 L;\nP\n\u2022 \u2202D(j D l) := i \u03b5i * Dei j D l = 0, i.e., Dj D l is a section of Z1 (T \u2217M, V ).\n\n\f18\n\nFRANCIS E. BURSTALL AND DAVID M. J. CALDERBANK\n\nThe components of j D l, relative to a Weyl structure with Weyl derivative D, are\n(4.1)\n\n( n1 tr c \u03c8, Dl, l)\n\nwhere\n\n\u03c8 = D D Dl + r D,D l.\n\nIn particular j D is a second order linear differential operator. Furthermore \u03c0Dj D l =\n\u03c8 \u2212 n1 (tr c \u03c8)c \u2208 T \u2217M \u2297 T \u2217M L.\nProof. With respect to any Weyl structure, a lift of l has components (\u03c3, \u03b8, l) and, using\n(2.12) and (3.1), we readily compute\n\" # \"\n#\n\u03c3\n\u2212n\u03c3 + tr c (D D \u03b8 + r D,D l)\nX\n\u03b5i * Dei \u03b8 =\nDl \u2212 \u03b8\nl\ni\n0\nwhich vanishes precisely when \u03b8 = Dl and \u03c3 =\n\n1\nn\n\ntr c \u03c8. The last part follows from (3.1). \u0003\n\nWe refer to j D l as the differential lift of l. Using this, we now define two second order\ndifferential operators on L, one linear, one quadratic.\nDefinition 4.2. Let (V, \u039b, D) be a conformal Cartan connection. Define HD : C\u221e (M, L) \u2192\nC\u221e (M, S02 T \u2217M L) and SD : C\u221e (M, L) \u2192 C\u221e (M, R) by\nHD l = sym \u03c0Dj D l,\n\nSD l = (j D l, j D l).\n\nUsing (4.1) and (3.1), we obtain the explicit formulae\n\u0001\nHD l = sym0 D D Dl + r D,D l\n(4.2)\n\u0001\nSD l = hDl, Dli \u2212 n2 l tr c D D Dl + r D,D l\n\nrelative to a Weyl structure with Weyl derivative D. When D is torsion-free, D D is the\nWeyl connection on T M induced by D. (Also in this case, the skew part of \u03c0Dj D l is\nF D + alt r D,D = n1 tr W D so that HD l = \u03c0Dj D l precisely when D is strongly torsion-free.)\nOur goal, achieved in the next section, is to recover the conformal Cartan connection\n(up to isomorphism) from the underlying conformal metric and these two operators.\nThe differential lift in general. For later use we remark that the above is a special case of\na more general construction [25, 35], which, for any representation W of so(V ), provides\na differential lift of any section of a Lie algebra homology bundle Hk (T \u2217M, W ) to give a\nrepresentative section of Zk (T \u2217M, W ). The key ingredient in this construction is the first\norder quabla operator \u0003 D := \u2202 \u25e6 d D + d D \u25e6 \u2202 on Ck (T \u2217M, W ) and the following observation.\nProposition 4.3. [25] \u0003 D is invertible on the image of \u2202.\nThis result is not difficult: using a Weyl structure, one shows that \u0003 D differs from an\ninvertible algebraic operator (Kostant's \u0003 [59]) by a nilpotent first order operator; the\ninverse is then given by a geometric series, and is a differential operator of finite order.\n\u22121\nD\nD\nWe then define \u03a0 = id \u2212 \u0003 \u22121\nD \u25e6 \u2202 \u25e6 d \u2212 d \u25e6 \u0003 D \u25e6 \u2202, and note the following properties:\n\u2022 \u03a0 vanishes on the image of \u2202;\n\u2022 \u03a0 maps into the kernel of \u2202;\n\u2022 \u03a0|ker \u2202 \u223c\n= id mod im \u2202.\nIt follows that there is a canonical differential lift j D : [\u03b1] 7\u2192 \u03a0\u03b1 from Lie algebra homology to cycles\u0002 [35]. \u0003 According to [25], j D [\u03b1] is characterized by the following properties:\n\u2202j D [\u03b1] = 0, j D [\u03b1] = [\u03b1] and \u2202d D j D [\u03b1] = 0. This generalizes the characterization of the\ndifferential lift in Proposition 4.1.\nThe differential operators HD , SD also have a homological interpretation and generalization. For n > 2, HD is the Bernstein\u2013Gelfand\u2013Gelfand operator [\u03b1] 7\u2192 [D\u03a0\u03b1]\nfrom C\u221e (M, H0 (T \u2217M, V )) to C\u221e (M, H1 (T \u2217M, V )), which is part of the general theory\n\n\fCONFORMAL SUBMANIFOLD GEOMETRY I\u2013III\n\n19\n\nof \u010cap\u2013Slov\u00e1k\u2013Sou\u010dek [35], whereas (for all n) SD (l) = l \u2294 l, \u2294 : C\u221e (M, H0 (T \u2217M, V )) \u00d7\nC\u221e (M, H0 (T \u2217M, V )) \u2192 C\u221e (M, R) being the bilinear operator of Calderbank\u2013Diemer [25]\ninduced by the metric pairing V \u00d7 V \u2192 R. We shall discuss this further in section 10.\n4B. M\u00f6bius structures. We are now going to define a class of linear and quadratic\ndifferential operators on any manifold with a conformal metric. First, for l a section of L\nand D a Weyl connection, define:\n(4.3)\n\nHD l = sym0 D 2 l\nSD l = hDl, Dli \u2212 n2 l \u2206D l\n\n\u2208 C \u221e (M, S02 T \u2217M L),\n\u2208 C \u221e (M, R),\n\nwhere \u2206D l = tr c D 2 l, a section of L\u22121 . A fundamental feature of HD and SD is that\nreplacing D by D + \u03b3 only alters them by zero-order terms. Indeed from (3.6), we have\n(4.4)\n\n\u2202\u03b3 HD (l) = (sym0 D\u03b3)l,\n\u2202\u03b3 SD (l) = 2h\u03b3l, Dli \u2212 n2 nlh\u03b3, Dli \u2212 n2 l(tr c D\u03b3)l = \u2212 n2 (tr c D\u03b3)l2 .\n\nThis observation will allow us to make a key definition. Before this, though, we compare\nthese variations with (3.9) and (3.11) to deduce that the formulae\nHc l = HD l + r0D l\nSc l = SD l \u2212 n2 s D l2\n\n(n > 3)\n(n > 2)\n\ndefine conformally-invariant second order differential operators, one linear, one quadratic.\nRemark 4.4. These operators, when they exist, may be defined in a manifestly invariant\nway on positive sections of L by associating to such a length scale l the normalized Ricci\ncurvature r D of the unique Weyl connection D with Dl = 0 (this is the Levi-Civita connection of the metric g = l\u22122 c, and r D is the normalized Ricci curvature of g). Then, by\ndefinition, since Dl = 0 we have Hc l = r0D l and Sc l = \u2212 n2 s D l2 , cf. [48]. Hence positive\nsolutions of Hc are sometimes called Einstein gauges and Sc is sometimes called the scalar\ncurvature metric. Hc itself is often called the conformal (tracefree) Hessian.\nRemark 4.5. We also note that differentiating (4.4) again, using \u2202\u03b3 D\u03b3 = \u22122\u03b3 \u22970 \u03b3 +\nn\u22122\n2\n2\nD\n2\nD\n2\nn h\u03b3, \u03b3ic, gives \u2202\u03b3,\u03b3 H (l) = \u22122\u03b3 \u22970 \u03b3 l and \u2202\u03b3,\u03b3 S (l) = \u2212 n (n \u2212 2)h\u03b3, \u03b3il , which are\nD\nD\nboth independent of D so that H and S depend quadratically on D:\nHD+\u03b3 l = HD l + (sym0 D\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b3 \u22970 \u03b3)l,\nSD+\u03b3 l = SD l \u2212\n\n1\nn\n\n\u0001\n2 tr c D\u03b3 + (n \u2212 2)h\u03b3, \u03b3i l2 .\n\nWe are now motivated to make our definition, cf. [24, 66].\n\nDefinition 4.6. A M\u00f6bius structure on a conformal manifold (M, c) is a pair M = (H, S)\nof differential operators such that\n\u2022 H : C\u221e (M, L) \u2192 C\u221e (M, S02 T \u2217M L) is a linear differential operator with H l \u2212 HD l zero\norder in l for some (hence any) Weyl connection D.\n\u2022 S : C\u221e (M, L) \u2192 C\u221e (M, R) is a quadratic differential operator with S l \u2212 SD l zero order\nin l for some (hence any) Weyl connection D.\nLet us summarize two basic motivations leading to this definition.\nProposition 4.7. First, if c is a conformal metric on a manifold M of dimension n > 3,\nthen there is a canonical M\u00f6bius structure Mc := (Hc , Sc ). on (M, c).\nSecond, if (V, \u039b, D) is a torsion-free conformal Cartan connection over a manifold M of\nany dimension, then MD := (HD , SD ) is a M\u00f6bius structure on M .\n\n\f20\n\nFRANCIS E. BURSTALL AND DAVID M. J. CALDERBANK\n\nM\u00f6bius structures form an affine space modelled on C\u221e (M, S 2 T \u2217M ). Indeed, for Q a\nsection of S 2 T \u2217M , let Q0 be its tracefree part, tr c Q its trace, and define, for M = (H, S),\n\u0001\n(4.5)\nM + Q := l 7\u2192 H l + Q0 l, l 7\u2192 S l \u2212 n2 (tr c Q)l2 .\n\nIn particular if we define MD := (HD , SD ), then for any M\u00f6bius structure M, M \u2212 MD\nsatisfies (for fixed M):\n\u2202\u03b3 (M \u2212 MD ) = \u2212 sym D\u03b3,\n\n(4.6)\n\nwhich is the origin of the choice of coefficient of tr c Q in our definition of M + Q. By\nadding \u2212 12 F D to this, we obtain a generalized notion of normalized Ricci curvature and an\nassociated decomposition of RD .\nDefinition 4.8. Let c, M be a M\u00f6bius structure. Then the M\u00f6bius Ricci curvature of a\nWeyl derivative D with respect to M is defined by r D,M := M \u2212 MD \u2212 12 F D . The Weyl\ncurvature W M of M is given by W M := RD \u2212 [[id \u2227 r D,M ]] for any Weyl derivative D. The\nCotton\u2013York curvature C M,D of M with respect to D is given by C M,D := d D r D,M .\nNote that W M is independent of the choice of D and thus is an invariant of the M\u00f6bius\nstructure: indeed, using (4.6) and \u2202\u03b3 F D = d\u03b3, we have \u2202\u03b3 r D,M = \u2212D\u03b3, which cancels\nwith (3.7). (We remark that we can differentiate once more to find\nr D+\u03b3,M = r D,M \u2212 D\u03b3 + \u03b3 \u2297 \u03b3 \u2212 12 h\u03b3, \u03b3ic,\n\n(4.7)\n\nso that r D,M has the same transformation law (3.4) as r D,D .)\nWe now fix a distinguished class of M\u00f6bius structures by requiring W M to coincide with\nthe Weyl curvature W of the underlying conformal metric. In general, we have RD =\nW M + [[id \u2227 r D,M ]], with the second term in the image of the Ricci map, so W is the\ncomponent of W M orthogonal to this image, i.e., in ker \u2202. Hence\n(4.8)\n\nWM = W\n\n\u21d4\n\nW M is in the kernel of the Ricci contraction, i.e., \u2202W M = 0.\n\nWhen n > 3, this amounts to requiring that the M\u00f6bius Ricci curvature with respect to M\nof each Weyl connection D coincides with the normalized Ricci curvature: r D,M = r D . More\ngenerally, by (2.13) and (3.10), we see that this is equivalent to requiring that sym0 r D,M =\nsym0 r D for n > 3 and that n1 tr c r D,M = s D for n > 2 (note that alt r D,M = alt r D by\ndefinition). In other words, when n > 3, a conformal metric alone is sufficient to fix a\ncanonical choice of M\u00f6bius structure; when n = 2, we still have a canonical choice Sc of\nquadratic operator but lack the linear operator; when n = 1, the linear operator necessarily\nvanishes but we lack the quadratic operator. To obtain a uniform approach, we impose the\nmissing data as extra structure as follows.\nDefinition 4.9. A conformal M\u00f6bius structure on a 1-manifold M is a second order quadratic differential operator Sc from L to R such that Sc \u2212 SD is zero order (for any D); c\nis the canonical section of S 2 T \u2217M L2 and Hc = 0.\nA conformal M\u00f6bius structure on a 2-manifold M is a conformal metric, together with\na second order linear differential operator Hc from L to S02 T \u2217M L such that Hc \u2212 HD is\nzero order (for any D); Sc is the canonical M\u00f6bius operator of c.\nIn higher dimensions a conformal M\u00f6bius structure is just a conformal metric; Hc , Sc are\nthe canonical M\u00f6bius operators of c.\nA M\u00f6bius manifold is a manifold equipped with a conformal M\u00f6bius structure (c, Hc , Sc ).\nWe now summarize the situation.\nProposition 4.10. (c, M) is a conformal M\u00f6bius structure if and only if \u2202W M = 0.\n\n\fCONFORMAL SUBMANIFOLD GEOMETRY I\u2013III\n\n21\n\nRemark 4.11. In the presence of a conformal M\u00f6bius structure, we define the normalized\nc\nRicci curvature of a Weyl derivative D to be r D,M . When n = 2, this provides a hitherto\nunavailable tracefree part of the normalized Ricci curvature. This idea was exploited in [24]\nto do Einstein\u2013Weyl geometry on M\u00f6bius 2-manifolds.\n5. The conformal equivalence problem\nIt is our contention that conformal Cartan geometries are the same as M\u00f6bius structures\nand that normal conformal Cartan geometries are the same as conformal M\u00f6bius structures.\nFor this, a common setting is provided by the bundle J 2 L of 2-jets of sections of L.\nA M\u00f6bius structure M = (H, S) is defined by a linear bundle map H : J 2 L \u2192 S02 T \u2217M L\nand a quadratic form S : J 2 L \u2192 R. The kernel of H is a rank n + 2 subbundle V of J 2 L, on\nwhich we have a quadratic form by restricting S. We easily see that this polarizes to give\na nondegenerate inner product of signature (n + 1, 1) on V and that the line L\u22121 of pure\ntrace elements of S 2 T \u2217M L is a null line subbundle. We shall exploit the jet structure of\nJ 2 L to find a canonical choice of strongly torsion-free conformal Cartan connection on V.\nConversely, a conformal Cartan geometry (V, \u039b, D) gives rise to a M\u00f6bius structure MD =\n(HD , SD ) and so we obtain a subbundle V of J 2 L with a conformal Cartan connection. We\nshall see that the differential lift, viewed as a bundle map J 2 L \u2192 V , restricts to give an\nisomorphism from V to V intertwining the conformal Cartan connections.\n5.1. The jet derivative and M\u00f6bius bundles. Recall (see [58] for further details) that\nfor any vector bundle E over M , the k-jet bundle J k E is the bundle whose fibre at x is\nJxk E := C\u221e (M, E)/Ixk where Ixk is the subspace of sections which vanish to order k at x.\nThus Jxk E may be regarded as the space of kth order Taylor series, at x, of sections of\nE, and there is a kth order differential operator j k : C\u221e (M, E) \u2192 C\u221e (M, J k E) sending a\nsection s to its equivalence class jxk s (the k-jet or kth order Taylor series) at each x \u2208 M .\nSince I k \u2282 I k\u22121 , there is, for each k, a natural surjective bundle map \u03c0k = \u03c0kE : J k E \u2192\nJ k\u22121 E, whose kernel is the bundle of kth derivatives S k T \u2217M \u2297 E. Note that \u03c0k \u25e6 j k = j k\u22121\nand j 0 identifies E with J 0 E.\nDefinition 5.1. The (semiholonomic) jet derivative on J k E is the first order differential\noperator dk : C\u221e (M, J k E) \u2192 \u03a91 (M, J k\u22121 E) defined by dk s = j 1 (\u03c0k s) \u2212 s.\nThis requires a brief explanation: j 1 (\u03c0k s) is a section of J 1 (J k\u22121 E). On the other hand,\nis a subbundle of J 1 (J k\u22121 E): the inclusion sends jxk s to jx1 j k\u22121 s. The difference\nk\u22121\nj 1 (\u03c0k s) \u2212 s lies in the kernel of \u03c01J E and hence defines a section of T \u2217M \u2297 J k\u22121 E.\nThe jet derivative is thus given by the difference between formal and actual differentiation: it measures the failure of a kth order Taylor series to be the first derivative of the\n(k \u2212 1)st order Taylor series obtained by truncation; note dk \u25e6 j k = 0. Our main use for it\nis to distinguish a preferred class of connections on subbundles of jet bundles.\nJ kE\n\nDefinition 5.2. Let F be a subbundle of J k E, let d and \u03c0 be the restrictions to F of the\njet derivative and the projection J k E \u2192 J k\u22121 E. Following [48], a connection \u2207 on F is\nsaid to be symmetric if \u03c0 \u25e6 \u2207 = d. The space of symmetric connections, if it is nonempty,\nis an affine space modelled on \u03a91 (M, Hom(F, ker \u03c0)).\nWe shall only need this formalism on J 2 L, where the jet derivative is a differential\noperator C\u221e (M, J 2 L) \u2192 \u03a91 (M, J 1 L). We next define the subbundles we shall use.\n\nDefinition 5.3. A M\u00f6bius bundle on a manifold M is a subbundle V of J 2 L with a\nnondegenerate metric such that ker \u03c0 \u2229 V \u2282 S 2 T \u2217M \u2297 L is a null line subbundle.\nThe following result explains the canonical nature of our forthcoming constructions.\n\n\f22\n\nFRANCIS E. BURSTALL AND DAVID M. J. CALDERBANK\n\nProposition 5.4. [48] Let V be a M\u00f6bius bundle on M . Then there is at most one symmetric metric connection on V.\nProof. We shall show that Hom(V, ker \u03c0) \u2229 so(V) = 0. Indeed a skew map V \u2192 ker \u03c0\nmust factor through the projection V \u2192 V/ ker \u03c0 \u22a5 . However, ker \u03c0 and V/ ker \u03c0 \u22a5 are one\ndimensional, and the maps V \u2192 V/ ker \u03c0 \u22a5 \u2192 ker \u03c0 \u2192 V are symmetric, not skew.\n\u0003\n5.2. M\u00f6bius structures induce conformal Cartan geometries. Let M = (H, S) be\na M\u00f6bius structure and define V = ker H \u2282 J 2 L. We wish to show that V is a M\u00f6bius\nbundle and that there is a symmetric metric connection on V.\nIn order to do this, we use a Weyl derivative D to decompose J 2 L compatibly with M:\ngiven M, D, identify J 2 L with S 2 T \u2217M L \u2295 T \u2217M L \u2295 L by sending j 2 l to (\u03c8, \u03b8, l) where\n\u03c8 = D 2 l + r D,M l,\n\n\u03b8 = Dl.\n\nThis induces an identification of J 1 L with T \u2217M L \u2295 L sending j 1 l to (Dl, l). Observe that\n\u03c8 is symmetric, since the skew part of r D,M is \u2212 12 F D so that \u03c8 = sym(D 2 l + r D,M l).\nWe have H(\u03c8, \u03b8, l) = \u03c80 (the tracefree part of \u03c8) so that V is identified with\n{(\u03c8, \u03b8, l) : \u03c8 = \u03c3c for \u03c3 \u2208 L\u22121 }.\n\nWe thus have an isomorphism L\u22121 \u2295 T \u2217M L \u2295 L \u223c\n= V sending (\u03c3, \u03b8, l) to (\u03c3c, \u03b8, l) \u2208 J 2 L.\n2\nNow S(\u03c8, \u03b8, l) = h\u03b8, \u03b8i \u2212 n (tr c \u03c8)l so that on V we have\nS(\u03c3, \u03b8, l) = h\u03b8, \u03b8i \u2212 2\u03c3l\n\nwhich is a metric of signature (n + 1, 1) for which L\u22121 is null. Hence V is a M\u00f6bius\nbundle. Furthermore, we have identified V with L\u22121 \u2295 T \u2217M L \u2295 L and so we are in the\nalgebraic setting of \u00a72B. In particular, the Lie bracket on so(V) is identified, under this\ndecomposition, with the bracket [[* , *]] defined there.\nThe jet derivative on J 2 L reads in our components\nd2 (\u03c8, \u03b8, l) = (D\u03b8 + r D,M l \u2212 \u03c8, Dl \u2212 \u03b8)\n\n(5.1)\nso that on V we have\n\nd(\u03c3, \u03b8, l) = (D\u03b8 + r D,M l \u2212 \u03c3c, Dl \u2212 \u03b8).\n\nNow define a connection \u2207 on V by\n\" #\n\" # \"\n#\nD,M\n\u03c3\n\u03c3\nDX \u03c3 + rX\n(\u03b8)\nD,M\nD,M\n(5.2)\n\u2207X \u03b8 = (rX + DX \u2212 X) \u03b8 = DX \u03b8 + rX l \u2212 \u03c3X\nl\nl\nDX l \u2212 \u03b8(X)\nD,M\nwhere rX\n\u2208 T \u2217M , X \u2208 T M are viewed as elements of so(L\u22121 \u2295 T \u2217M \u2295 L) via (2.12). It\nis clear that \u2207 is symmetric. Moreover, \u2207 is metric since D is metric and differs from \u2207\nby an so(V)-valued 1-form. Further, with \u039b = L\u22121 , \u2207 is a conformal Cartan connection\nwhose soldering form is precisely the 'musical' isomorphism T M L\u22121 \u2192 T \u2217M L \u223c\n= \u039b\u22a5 /\u039b\n(which is the origin of our choice of sign in the definition of the soldering form).\nWe have \u2207 = r D,M + D \u2212 id so that\n\nR\u2207 = d D r D,M + RD \u2212 [[id \u2227 r D,M ]] \u2212 d D id = C M,D + W M\n\nsince D is torsion-free. Furthermore,\ntr[[id \u2227 r D,M ]] = nF D = tr RD\n\nso that W M has vanishing trace, from which we conclude that R\u2207 |L\u22121 = 0, i.e., \u2207 is\nstrongly torsion-free. We therefore have the following result, cf. [37, 48, 75] when n > 3.\n\n\fCONFORMAL SUBMANIFOLD GEOMETRY I\u2013III\n\n23\n\nProposition 5.5. Let M = (H, S) be a M\u00f6bius structure. Then the M\u00f6bius bundle V =\nker H has a unique symmetric metric connection \u2207 and (V, L\u22121 , \u2207) is a conformal Cartan\ngeometry with curvature given (in components) by\nR\u2207 = C M,D + W M .\nWhen is \u2207 normal? The answer is immediate: since T \u2217M is abelian, \u2202R\u2207 = \u2202W M and\nso, in view of Proposition 4.10, we have the following conclusion.\nProposition 5.6. (V, L\u22121 , \u2207) is a normal conformal Cartan geometry if and only if M is\na conformal M\u00f6bius structure.\n5.3. Conformal Cartan geometries are M\u00f6bius structures. We have seen already\nthat any conformal Cartan geometry (V, \u039b, D) on M determines a M\u00f6bius structure in a\ncanonical way: we saw already in \u00a71A that a conformal Cartan connection determines a\nconformal metric c on M ; then, in \u00a74A we defined differential operators HD l = sym \u03c0Dj D l\nand SD l = (j D l, j D l) on L, using the differential lift l 7\u2192 j D l, which define a M\u00f6bius structure MD = (HD , SD ) if D is torsion-free. It remains to show that these two constructions\nare mutually inverse up to natural isomorphism.\nIn one direction, this is straightforward: the M\u00f6bius structure associated to the conformal\nCartan connection (V, L\u22121 , \u2207) in this way is (c, M) itself. This is clear for the conformal\nstructure. For the rest, we recall that for any conformal Cartan connection (V, \u039b, D), a\nWeyl structure determines an isomorphism between V and L\u22121 \u2295 T \u2217M L \u2295 L, with respect\nto which the Cartan connection may be written:\n\" #\n\" # \"\n#\nD,D\n\u03c3\n\u03c3\nDX \u03c3 + rX\n(\u03b8)\nD,D\nD,D\n(5.3)\nDX \u03b8 = (rX + DX \u2212 X) \u03b8 = DX \u03b8 + rX\nl \u2212 \u03c3X .\nl\nl\nDX l \u2212 \u03b8(X)\nIn the case that (V, \u039b, D) = (V, L\u22121 , \u2207), this decomposition coincides with that of \u00a75.2,\nand we have r D,D = r D,M , so that MD = M.\nIt remains to prove that the constructions are inverse the other way around, i.e., that\nwe recover (V, \u039b, D) as the canonical Cartan connection of (c, MD ). We can only expect to\ndo this up to isomorphism, since V is an abstract bundle. Furthermore, since the canonical\nCartan connection of (c, MD ) is strongly torsion-free, we must suppose that D is strongly\ntorsion-free also. In this case alt r D,D = \u2212F D , so that r D,D is the M\u00f6bius Ricci curvature\nD\nr D,M of D with respect to MD .\nProposition 5.7. Let (V, \u039b, D) be a conformal Cartan geometry and let V \u2282 J 2 L be the\nM\u00f6bius bundle of the induced M\u00f6bius structure (c, MD ). Then the differential lift j D , as a\nbundle map J 2 L \u2192 V , restricts to an isomorphism from (V, L\u22121 , \u2207) \u2192 (V, \u039b, D).\nD\n\nProof. We choose a Weyl derivative D and compute in components. Since r D,D = r D,M ,\nthe bundle map j D : J 2 L \u2192 V is then given by (\u03c8, \u03b8, l) 7\u2192 ( n1 tr c \u03c8, \u03b8, l). Hence it is an\nisometry when restricted to V and maps L\u22121 to \u039b. Comparing (5.2) with (5.3) we see that\nthis isomorphism identifies the connections \u2207 and D.\n\u0003\nLet us combine Propositions 5.5, 5.6 and 5.7 to summarize our results so far.\nTheorem 5.8. Let c and M = (H, S) define a M\u00f6bius structure on a manifold M . Then\nthere is a unique symmetric metric connection on the M\u00f6bius bundle V = ker H \u2282 J 2 L\nand this is a conformal Cartan geometry compatible with the same M\u00f6bius structure. Any\nconformal Cartan geometry arises in this way up to natural isomorphism, and is normal if\nand only if the M\u00f6bius structure is conformal.\n\n\f24\n\nFRANCIS E. BURSTALL AND DAVID M. J. CALDERBANK\n\nRemark 5.9. It is straightforward to extend this equivalence to general torsion-free conformal Cartan connections by extending the notion of a M\u00f6bius structure to include a 2-form\nF. In order to make room for this 2-form in the jet bundle picture, it is necessary to work\nwith semiholonomic jets-or equivalently, to extend the jet derivative to J 2 L\u2295(\u22272 T \u2217M \u2297L).\nBy this device it is even possible to consider arbitrary conformal Cartan connections, but\nthe notion of a M\u00f6bius structure must be modified further in the presence of torsion. Since\nwe do not see any advantage in this generality, and it would have clouded the exposition\nconsiderably, we have restricted attention to the strongly torsion-free case.\n5.4. Normalization of conformal Cartan geometries. M\u00f6bius structures compatible\nwith a fixed conformal metric on a manifold M form an affine space modelled on sections\nof S 2 T \u2217M . We now exploit Theorem 5.8 to lift this affine structure to conformal Cartan\ngeometries. Let (V, \u039b, D) be a conformal Cartan geometry and Q \u2208 C\u221e (M, S 2 T \u2217M ). We\nview Q as an so(V )-valued 1-form via (2.3) so that\n(5.4)\n\nQX \u03c3 = 0,\n\nQX DY \u03c3 = \u2212QX (Y )\u03c3,\n\nQX (V ) \u2286 \u039b\u22a5 .\n\nIn particular, D + Q is a conformal Cartan connection with the same soldering form as D\nand so induces the same conformal metric on M . In fact, more can be said.\nLemma 5.10. If D is strongly torsion-free, so is D + Q and MD+Q = MD + Q.\nProof. Since T \u2217M \u2282 so(V ) is abelian, we have\nRD+Q = RD + d D Q + 12 [Q \u2227 Q] = RD + d D Q,\nso D + Q is strongly torsion-free iff d D Q|\u039b = 0. Now, using (5.4), we have\n(d D Q)X,Y \u03c3 = (DX Q)Y \u03c3 \u2212 (DY Q)X \u03c3 = \u2212QY DX \u03c3 + QX DY \u03c3 = (QY X\u2212QX Y )\u03c3 = 0.\nFor the second assertion, we must compute j D+Q l: using (2.7) and (2.6), we see that this\ndiffers from j D l by a section of \u039b and then the definition of the differential lift, along with\n(2.9), shows that j D+Q l = j D l+ n1 (tr c Q)l. Thus (j D+Q l, j D+Q l) = (j D l, j D l)\u2212 n2 (tr c Q)l2 .\nFinally, for any section \u03c3 of \u039b,\n\u03c0(D + Q)X (v + \u03c3) = \u03c0DX v + QX \u2297 p(v) \u2212 X \u2297 \u03c3\nfrom which we deduce that \u03c0(D + Q)j D+Q l = \u03c0Dj D l + (Q \u2212 n1 (tr c Q)c)l and the result\nimmediately follows.\n\u0003\nThis procedure allows us to 'normalize' a conformal Cartan geometry, which will be\nimportant later. For this we use the fact, cf. Proposition 5.6 and Proposition 4.10, that a\nconformal Cartan geometry is normal iff the Weyl curvature of the corresponding M\u00f6bius\nstructure has zero Ricci contraction. Now for any M\u00f6bius structure M, we have W M+Q =\nW M \u2212 [[id \u2227 Q]] and so\n(5.5)\n\n\u2202W M+Q = \u2202W M \u2212 (n \u2212 2)Q0 \u2212 2(n \u2212 1)( n1 tr c Q)c.\n\nSince \u2202W M is symmetric (and is tracelike for n = 2 and vanishes for n = 1) we have:\nProposition 5.11. Let (V, \u039b, D) be a conformal Cartan geometry. Then there is a unique\nsection Q of S 2 T \u2217M such that\n(i) D \u2212 Q is normal;\n\n(ii) Q0 = 0 if n = 2 and Q = 0 if n = 1, i.e., Q is in the image of the Ricci contraction \u2202.\n\n\fCONFORMAL SUBMANIFOLD GEOMETRY I\u2013III\n\n25\n\n6. M\u00f6bius structures in low dimensions\nThe low dimensional cases dim M = 1 or dim M = 2 merit special attention for two\nrelated reasons. First, any such M admits conformal coordinates so that any conformal\nmetric is flat. On the other hand, our theory introduces a new ingredient in addition\nto the conformal metric for, in this case, M supports many conformal M\u00f6bius structures\ncompatible with a given conformal metric. We now discuss the geometrical meaning of\nthese data and explain how to compute them from a normal conformal Cartan connection.\nIn all this we shall make use of a further feature of low dimensional geometry. As we\nnoted in Remark 1.3, our conformal Cartan connections are a linear representation of the\nusual notion. We chose the standard representation for simplicity, but other choices are\npossible. If we take G = Spin0 (n + 1, 1) (which is a double cover of the identity component\nof M\u00f6b(n)) we can use the spin representation. Such a choice is particularly effective\nfor n 6 4, when special isomorphisms of G with more familiar Lie groups give concrete\nrealizations of spinors.\n6.1. Computing the M\u00f6bius structure. Let us consider in general how to compute\nthe M\u00f6bius structure MD associated to a conformal Cartan geometry (V, \u039b, D) via the\ndifferential lift: \u00a74A provides formulae for this, but they can be difficult to use since\none must decompose D with respect to a Weyl structure. Instead, we shall write MD =\nMD + sym r D,D relative to a Weyl derivative D, and compute sym r D,D directly.\nRecall that if i\u039b : \u039b \u2192 V is the inclusion, we can define DD i\u039b : T M \u2297 \u039b \u2192 \u039b\u22a5 \u2282 V .\nDifferentiating again using (3.1), we find that\n\u0001\nD,D\n(6.1)\n(DD )2 i\u039b X,Y \u03c3 + rX,Y\n\u03c3 = X * Y * \u03c3,\n\nfor vector fields X, Y and any section \u03c3 of \u039b. In other words, (DD )2 i\u039b + r D,D i\u039b = c \u2297 i\u039b\u0302 ,\nwhere i\u039b\u0302 : \u039b\u0302 \u2192 V is the inclusion of the Weyl structure corresponding to D. The tracefree\npart of this formula then yields:\n\u0001\n(6.2)\nsym0 (DD )2 i\u039b + r D,D i\u039b = 0.\n\nThe trace part is still difficult to use because of the appearance of i\u039b\u0302 . To get around this, we\nnote that if ei \u2297 \u03c3 is an orthonormal frame of T M \u039b, and \u03c3\u0302 \u2208 C\u221e (M, \u039b\u0302) with (\u03c3, \u03c3\u0302) = \u22121,\nthen \u03c3, (DD\nei i\u039b )\u03c3 and \u03c3\u0302 form a frame of V relative to which we have, for any v \u2208 V ,\n(v, v) =\n\nn\nX\n(v, (DD\nei i\u039b )\u03c3) \u2212 2(v, \u03c3)(v, \u03c3\u0302).\ni=1\n\nCombining this with the trace of (6.1), using X * Y * \u03c3 = hX, Y i\u03c3\u0302, we then have\n(6.3)\n\nn n\nX\ni=1\n\nv, (DD\nei i\u039b )\u03c3\n\n\u00012\n\n\u2212 n2 (v, \u03c3) v, ((DD )2ei ,ei i\u039b )\u03c3\n\n\u0001o\n\n\u2212 n2 s D,D (v, i\u039b )2 = (v, v).\n\nIf we take v = \u03c3\u0302, this formula simplifies, because v is then null and orthogonal to (DD\nei i\u039b )\u03c3.\nHowever, the computational advantage of (6.3) is the explicitness of the dependence on D.\nRemark 6.1. The formulae (6.2)\u2013(6.3) have a conceptual explanation: viewing i\u039b as a\nsection of L \u2297 V , the D-coupled differential lift of i\u039b is minus the metric in V \u2297 V . This\nlast is parallel, so that the D-coupled M\u00f6bius operator HD,D gives zero when applied to\ni\u039b . On the other hand SD,D (i\u039b ) is a partial contraction of this differential lift with itself,\nwhich reproduces the metric.\n\n\f26\n\nFRANCIS E. BURSTALL AND DAVID M. J. CALDERBANK\n\nNow specialize to the case where D is exact with gauge \u03c3 (i.e., D\u03c3 = 0), so that F D = 0.\nAssume also that v is null.

M\u00f6bius 1-manifolds and projective structures. A conformal Cartan connection\n(V, \u039b, D) on a 1-manifold M is automatically flat, hence a normal conformal Cartan geometry. Further, by Proposition 1.2, there is a distinguished family of local immersions\nof M into P(L) (here a circle), which cover M and are related on overlaps by elements of\nM\u00f6b(1) = O+ (2, 1).\nNow Spin0 (2, 1) \u223c\n= SL(2, R), corresponding to the realization of S 1 as the real projective\n1\n2,1\nline RP . Thus R = S 2 R2 , the set of symmetric matrices on R2 , where the quadratic\nform is minus the determinant. More precisely, fix a symplectic form \u03c9R \u2208 \u22272 R2\u2217 and\nconsider R2 \u2297 R2 with the metric\n(v1 \u2297 v2 , w1 \u2297 w2 ) = \u2212\u03c9R (v1 , w2 )\u03c9R (v2 , w1 )\n\nThe symmetric tensors form a subspace on which the metric has signature (2, 1). The\nquadratic map x 7\u2192 x \u2297 x : R2 \u2192 R2,1 then induces a diffeomorphism RP 1 \u2192 P(L).\nThe trivial R2 bundle and tautological line subbundle O(\u22121)R \u2282 RP 1 \u00d7 R2 may be\nabstracted as follows: a 'spin Cartan connection' is a real rank 2 symplectic vector bundle\n(VR , \u03c9R ) \u2192 M with symplectic connection \u2207 and a line subbundle \u039bR such that \u2207|\u039bR mod\n\u039bR defines an isomorphism T M \u2297 \u039bR \u2192 VR /\u039bR . This is a one dimensional projective\nstructure and is always flat. Given such a spin Cartan connection, we obtain a conformal\nCartan connection on V = S 2 VR with \u039b = \u039b2R : the induced connection preserves the bundle\nmetric defined pointwise as above.\nIt follows that a conformal Cartan connection carries the information of a projective\nstructure on M , and it is natural to enquire how this arises in explicit geometric terms.\nWe do this now by showing how projective coordinates, Hill operators and schwarzian\nderivatives arise from D.\nFirst, let x be a coordinate on M and D x the unique connection on T M with D x \u2202x = 0,\nwhere \u2202x is the vector field with dx(\u2202x ) = 1. (Any connection on a 1-manifold is a LeviCivita connection, hence a Weyl connection: D x is the Levi-Civita connection of the metric\ndx2 induced by x.) If \u03c3x = |dx| and v is a null section of V with (v, \u03c3x ) 6= 0, then (6.5)\nyields a formula for the only nontrivial datum of the M\u00f6bius structure:\n\u0001\nv, D\u2202x D\u2202x \u03c3x\n(v, D\u2202x \u03c3x )2\nD x ,D\n2\n\u2212\ns\n|\u2202x | =\n2(v, \u03c3x )2\n(v, \u03c3x )\nSuppose now that w is another coordinate with dw = w\u2032 dx and assume for simplicity that\nw\u2032 > 0 so that \u03c3w := |dw| = w\u2032 \u03c3x . Then D\u2202w \u03c3w = D\u2202x \u03c3x + w\u2032\u2032 /w\u2032 and hence\n\u0010 w\u2032\u2032 \u0011\u2032 1 \u0010 w\u2032\u2032 \u00112\nw\nx\n(6.6)\ns D ,D |\u2202w |2 = s D ,D |\u2202x |2 \u2212\n+\n.\nw\u2032\n2 w\u2032\nx\nx\nWe define a projective coordinate to be a coordinate x with s D ,D = 0, so that SD = SD .\nSuch coordinates can be found by solving a nonlinear ODE.\n\nProposition 6.2. Let (M, MD ) be a M\u00f6bius 1-manifold. Then there are (local) projective\ncoordinates on M , and if x is such a coordinate, then another coordinate w(x) is projective\nif and only if the schwarzian Sx (w) := (w\u2032\u2032 /w\u2032 )\u2032 \u2212 12 (w\u2032\u2032 /w\u2032 )2 of w with respect to x is zero.\nAnother approach to one dimensional projective structures is via Hill (or Hill's) operators\n\u2206, i.e., second order differential operators on C\u221e (M, L1/2 ) which differ from a second\nderivative D 2 by a zero order term. For this we view D as a spin Cartan connection on VR\n\n\fCONFORMAL SUBMANIFOLD GEOMETRY I\u2013III\n\n27\n\n(with S 2 VR = V ) preserving a symplectic form \u03c9R and such that X \u2297 \u03bb 7\u2192 \u2212DX \u03bb mod \u039bR\ndefines an isomorphism from T M \u2297 \u039bR to VR /\u039bR \u223c\n=\u03c9R \u039b\u2217R = L1/2 .\nAs in Proposition 4.1 any section f of L1/2 has a differential lift j D f which is the unique\nsection of VR that projects onto f and satisfies Dj D f \u2208 ker \u2202 \u2229 \u03a91 (M, VR ) = \u03a91 (M, \u039bR ). If\nwe choose a Weyl connection D, then the derivative DD i\u039bR of the inclusion i\u039bR : \u039bR \u2192 VR\ndetermines a splitting VR = \u039bR \u2295 \u039b\u2217R , and using this decomposition we find\nD(\u03bb, f ) = (D\u03bb + 12 s D,D f, Df \u2212 \u03bb).\nIt follows that j D f is essentially the 1-jet of f and f 7\u2192 \u2206D f := Dj D f is a Hill operator:\nwith respect to any Weyl derivative D, we have j D f = (Df, f ), and \u2206D f = D 2 f + 21 s D,D f .\nThis provides another way of computing the M\u00f6bius structure, and it is well known that\nthe zero order term of a Hill operator transforms by schwarzian derivative under changes\nof coordinate.\nThe two approaches are related in a simple way.\nProposition 6.3. The quadratic operator SD (l) is related to the Hill operator \u2206D f , when\nl = f 2 , by SD (l) = \u22124f 3 \u2206D f .\nProof. This is straightforward to prove using a Weyl derivative. Alternatively, observe that\nj D l = (j D f )\u2297(j D f )+\u03c3, where \u03c3 = \u2202D((j D f )\u2297(j D f )). (This follows because \u2202D\u03c3 = \u2212\u03c3.)\nWe then compute, using dual frames e, \u03b5 (i.e., \u03b5(e) = 1), that SD (l) = 2(j D f \u2297 j D f, \u03c3) =\n4\u03c9R (j D f, De j D f )\u03c9R (j D f, \u03b5 * j D f ) = \u22124f 3 Dj D f .\n\u0003\nWe have already noted that VR can be identified the 1-jet bundle of L1/2 ; its parallel\nsections are 'affine with respect to D', i.e., 1-jets of solutions of \u2206D f = 0. Similarly,\nV = S 2 \u039bR is the 2-jet bundle of L, and L is the tangent bundle if M is oriented; the\nparallel sections are 2-jets of projective vector fields, i.e., vector fields X with LX \u2206D = 0.\nRemark 6.4. The interpretation of s D as a one dimensional analogue of scalar curvature\nsuggests the following Yamabe-like problem: given a projective structure \u2206 on M = R/Z,\nis there a gauge of constant scalar curvature? This amounts to solving R\u2206\u03bc = c\u03bc\u22123 for\na constant c and a positive section \u03bc of L1/2 which we normalize via M \u03bc\u22122 = 1: if\nD\n\u22122\nD\u03bc = 0, we\nhave\nfunctional\nR then\nR s = c\u03bc . Solutions are critical points of the Yamabe-like\n\u22122\nY (\u03bc) = ( M \u03bc )( M \u03bc \u2206\u03bc). Given a solution \u03bc, we have \u2206(f \u03bc) = (f \u2032\u2032 + cf )\u03bc\u22123 for any\nf \u2208 C \u221e (M, R), from which it is straightforward to determine the developing map \u03b4 from\n\u221a\nM\u0303 = R to RP 1 \u223c\n= R \u222a {\u221e}: \u03b4(x) = \u221a1c tan( cx) for c > 0, \u03b4(x) = x for c = 0 and\n\u221a\n\u03b4(x) = \u221a1\u2212c tanh( \u2212cx) for c < 0. The constant c determines the conjugacy class of the\nholonomy and, for c > 0 (when the developing map surjects), the winding number of the\nfundamental domain [0, 1): the fundamental domain injects for c 6 4\u03c0 2 . Any such data\narise for some (unique) c \u2208 R, and so any projective structure admits a constant scalar\ncurvature gauge. Without the geometric interpretation, the existence of critical points\nfor Y is not obvious, since Y is unbounded: if \u03bc\u03b5 (x) = (1 + \u03b5 + cos(2\u03c0x))dx\u22121/2 , where\nR\n\u223c\n=\nx : M \u2192 R/Z, then M \u03bc\u22122\n\u03b5 can be arbitrarily large for \u03b5 > 0.\n6.3.

The quadratic map x 7\u2192 x \u2297 x\u0304 : C2 \u2192 R3,1 then induces a\nconformal diffeomorphism CP 1 \u2192 P(L).\nThe trivial C2 -bundle and the tautological complex line subbundle O(\u22121)C \u2282 CP 1 \u00d7 C2\nmay be abstracted as follows: a 'spin Cartan connection' as a complex rank 2 symplectic\nvector bundle (VC , \u03c9C ) \u2192 M with complex symplectic connection \u2207 and a complex line\nsubbundle \u039bC such that the linear bundle map \u2207|\u039bC mod \u039bC : T M \u2297 \u039bC \u2192 VC /\u039bC is\nan isomorphism. A spin Cartan connection induces a conformal Cartan connection via\nV = (VC \u2297 V\u0304C )R and \u039b = (\u039bC \u2297 \u039b\u0304C )R (the fixed points of the conjugation involution): the\ninduced connection preserves the bundle metric defined pointwise as above.\nThe conformal M\u00f6bius structures compatible with a given conformal metric form an affine\nspace modelled on C \u221e (M, S02 T \u2217M ). To compute this extra datum, we compare a given\nM\u00f6bius structure with that provided by a holomorphic coordinate z: given this, dz d z\u0304 is a\nflat metric compatible with c and so arises from a length scale l which is parallel for the (flat)\nz\nLevi-Civita connection D z of this metric. Contemplate the M\u00f6bius structure Mz := MD :\nz\nz\nz\nz\nz\nz\nz\nsince F D vanishes, r D ,M = 0 so that, first, C D ,M = 0 and, second, W M = RD = 0,\nwhence the corresponding Cartan connection Dz is flat by Proposition 5.5.\nSince S02 T \u2217M \u2297 C \u223c\n= \u03a92,0 M \u2295 \u03a90,2 M , where \u03a92,0 M = (T 1,0 M )\u22122 , \u03a90,2 M = (T 0,1 M )\u22122 ,\n1,0\nand T M \u2297 C = T M \u2295 T 0,1 M is the \u00b1i-eigenspace decomposition of the complex structure J : T M \u2192 T M , we can identify C \u221e (M, S02 T \u2217M ) with the space of smooth quadratic\nz\ndifferentials and write r0D ,D = q dz 2 + q\u0304 d z\u0304 2 . We now take D = D z in equation (6.4) and\nnote that D\u2202zz \u2202z = 0 to conclude:\nD\u2202z D\u2202z \u03c3 + q\u03c3 = 0.\nThis gives an effective method to compute r0D\n\nz ,D\n\n.\n\nProposition 6.5. Let (V, \u039b, D) a conformal Cartan geometry on a 2-manifold M with a\nz\nholomorphic coordinate z for the induced conformal metric. Let M = Mz + r D ,D be the\nz\ninduced M\u00f6bius structure and write r0D ,D = q dz 2 + q\u0304 d z\u0304 2 . Then\n(6.7)\n\nD\u2202z D\u2202z \u03c3 + q\u03c3 = 0\n\nwhere \u03c3 is the (unique) positive section of \u039b with (D\u03c3, D\u03c3) = dz d z\u0304.\nIt is instructive to apply this analysis to the M\u00f6bius structure Mw where w is another\nholomorphic coordinate. Let Dw be the corresponding Cartan connection and \u03c3w the\nsection of \u039b with (Dw \u03c3w , Dw \u03c3w ) = dw d w\u0304 = |w\u2032 |2 dz d z\u0304, where \u2032 denotes differentiation\nwith respect to z.

We thus have the following transformation law.\n\nProposition 6.6. Mw = Mz + Re(Sz (w)dz 2 ).\nThis prompts us, with [24], to define the schwarzian derivative Sz (M) of a M\u00f6bius\nstructure M with respect to z by\n(M \u2212 Mz )2,0 = 12 Sz (M)dz 2 .\n\nFor coordinate M\u00f6bius structures, we have seen that Sz (Mw ) = Sz (w), and in all cases, it\nhas the classical transformation law: M \u2212 Mw = (M \u2212 Mz ) + (Mz \u2212 Mw ) giving\nSw (M) = Sz (M)(dz/dw)2 + Sw (z).\n\n\fCONFORMAL SUBMANIFOLD GEOMETRY I\u2013III\n\n29\n\nNote that the holomorphicity of Sz (M) is independent of the coordinate z and amounts to\nz\nthe flatness of M: if M is flat then, since D z is flat and M is canonical, r D ,M = QD\n0 ; hence\nz\nD\nD\nd Q0 = 0, i.e., Sz (M) is holomorphic. Conversely, if Sz (M) is holomorphic, solving a\nholomorphic ODE yields a coordinate w with Sw (M) = 0, i.e., M = Mw , which is flat. In\nparticular, any flat M is locally of the form Mw for some holomorphic coordinate w.\nz\n(Alternatively, note that since D z is flat, a canonical M has r D ,M = QD\n0 while, since\nz\nD\nM\nD\ndim M = 2, W = 0 whence M is flat if and only if d Q0 = 0 which last amounts to the\nholomorphicity of Sz (M).)\nAs in the one dimensional case, we relate the schwarzian derivative appearing here to\nHill operators and projective structures using the spin representation \u039bC \u2282 VC of D above.\nA Weyl derivative D provides a decomposition VC = \u039bC \u2295 \u039b\u2217C with respect to which the\ndifferential lift of f \u2208 \u039b\u2217C may be written j D f = (\u2202 D f, f ), where \u2202 D f is the complex linear\npart of Df , i.e., \u2202 D f = Df \u2212 \u2202f . (For D = D z , this was denoted by a prime above.)\nIt follows that [Dj D f ] = ((\u2202 D )2 f + q D,D f, \u2202f ) and the first component is a complex Hill\noperator, where q D,D = (r0D,D )2,0 : if D = D z , this may be written f \u2032\u2032 + qf , explaining the\nappearance of the complex schwarzian derivative above.\nIt is easy to relate the two pictures: the 'real' M\u00f6bius operator Hl = sym0 D 2 l + r0D,D l\nis obtained from the complex Hill operator (\u2202 D )2 f + q D f , when l = f \u2297 f \u0304, by coupling the\nlatter to the antiholomorphic structure \u2202 on \u039b\u0304C and taking the real part.\n6.4.

The quaternionic realization of S 4 has proved to be\nvery effective in the conformal geometry of surfaces in S 3 and S 4 [18, 56], and we shall\ndiscuss this briefly later. The conformal Cartan connection may be recovered using the\nreal structure j \u2227 j on \u22272C VH .\nThe case n = 3 is similar: Spin0 (4, 1) \u223c\n= Sp(1, 1) corresponds to the realization of S 3\n1\nas a real quadric in HP . The 'spin Cartan connections' are therefore similar to the four\ndimensional case, except that VH is equipped with a signature (1, 1) quaternion-hermitian\nmetric with respect to which \u039bH is null. We leave the details to the interested Reader.\nIn three and four dimensions, a normal Cartan connection is determined by the conformal\nmetric, so there is no additional data to compute.

It acts on A is the usual way: for\ng \u2208 G we have\n\n(7.1)\n\ng * D := g \u25e6 D \u25e6 g \u22121 = D \u2212 (Dg)g \u22121 .\n\nSince g acts orthogonally on V and preserves \u039b+ , g * D and D induce the same conformal\nmetric on M . Hence if Ac \u2282 A denotes the subset of connections inducing a fixed conformal\nmetric c, Ac is preserved by G. We next ask when gauge equivalent conformal Cartan\nconnections induce the same soldering form.\nProposition 7.1. Let D be a conformal Cartan connection and g a gauge transformation.\nThen D and g * D have the same soldering form iff g = exp \u03b3 with \u03b3 \u2208 T \u2217M \u2282 stab(\u039b).\n\nProof. g * D has the same soldering form as D if and only if g commutes with \u03b2 D , i.e.,\ng\u03b2 D \u03c3 = \u03b2 D g\u03c3. However, g\u039b+ \u2282 \u039b+ so that g\u03c3 = eu \u03c3 for some function u and now\ng\u03b2 D \u03c3 = eu \u03b2 D \u03c3 implies, by the Cartan condition, that\ng|\u039b\u22a5 = eu id + \u03b3 \u25e6 \u03c0\n\nwith \u03b3 : \u039b\u22a5 /\u039b \u2192 \u039b. Now g acts orthogonally so, for v \u2208 \u039b\u22a5 ,\n(v, v) = (gv, gv) = e2u (v, v)\n\nwhence eu = 1. In particular, g|\u039b\u22a5 = id + \u03b3 \u25e6 \u03c0. However, it is not difficult to see that any\northogonal g is determined by its values on \u039b\u22a5 and so we conclude that g = exp \u03b3 under\nthe usual soldering identification of Hom(\u039b\u22a5 /\u039b, \u039b) with T \u2217M . Certainly any g of this form\npreserves \u03b2 D .\n\u0003\nWe now combine this gauge theory with the normalization of conformal Cartan connections discussed in \u00a75.4. Let D be a fixed strongly torsion-free connection inducing the\nconformal metric c. Then Lemma 5.10 assures us that any other strongly torsion-free connection induces the same M\u00f6bius structure as one of the form D + Q, and is therefore\ngauge equivalent to it by Proposition 5.7. In fact the connections of the form D + Q provide a slice to the gauge action: it just remains to show that D and D + Q are only gauge\nequivalent if Q = 0. However, since they have the same soldering form, Proposition 7.1\nand equation (3.2) show that Q = \u2212D\u03b3 \u2212 12 [[\u03b3, \u03c0D\u03b3]]. Therefore 0 = \u2212QX \u03c3 = (DX \u03b3)\u03c3 =\n\u2212\u03b3 * DX \u03c3 = \u03b3(X)\u03c3 for any vector field X. Thus \u03b3 = 0 and Q = 0.\nTheorem 7.2. Let Acstf be the set of strongly torsion-free conformal Cartan connections\ninducing the conformal metric c. Then G acts freely on Acstf and, if D is a fixed element of\nAcstf , there is a unique connection of the form D + Q in each G-orbit.\n7.2. Constant vectors, spaceform geometries and stereoprojection. If (V, \u039b, D)\nis a conformal Cartan geometry on M , then we have seen that the compatible riemannian\nmetrics correspond to sections \u03c3 of L+ \u2282 \u039b via g\u03c3 (X, Y ) = (DX \u03c3, DY \u03c3). This induces a\nWeyl structure \u039b\u0302 \u2282 V spanned by \u03c3\u0302 with (\u03c3\u0302, \u03c3\u0302) = 0 and (\u03c3\u0302, DX \u03c3) = 0.\nWhen D is flat, a particularly important class of sections of L+ are the conic sections:\nthese sections are given by the intersection of L+ with an affine hyperplane, i.e., {\u03c3 \u2208 L+ :\n\u22a5 on M .\n(v\u221e , \u03c3) = \u22121}, where v\u221e is a parallel section of V and we assume that \u039b 6\u2286 v\u221e\nSince (DX \u03c3, v\u221e ) = 0 and (DX \u03c3, \u03c3) = 0, the corresponding Weyl structure is spanned by\n(7.2)\n\n\u03c3\u0302 = v\u221e + 12 (v\u221e , v\u221e )\u03c3.\n\nThe length scale l dual to \u03c3 (with h\u03c3, li = 1) is the homology class v\u221e mod \u039b\u22a5 , and v\u221e\nis the differential lift j D l of Proposition 4.1. In this case the corresponding metric g is an\nEinstein metric (since H l = 0) of constant curvature n2 s g l2 = \u2212S l = \u2212(v\u221e , v\u221e ), and is\nthe metric of a spherical, euclidean or hyperbolic spaceform.\n\n\fCONFORMAL SUBMANIFOLD GEOMETRY I\u2013III\n\n31\n\nTo see this explicitly, suppose that M is simply connected, so we may assume V =\nM \u00d7 Rn+1,1 with D = d and v\u221e constant. Then x 7\u2192 \u039bx defines a local diffeomorphism\n\u22a5 \u2229 L)-which is P(L), P(L) r {<v >} or P(L) with a hypersphere\nfrom M to P(L) r P(v\u221e\n\u221e\nremoved, according to whether v\u221e is timelike, null, or spacelike, cf. \u00a71A.\n\u2022 If v\u221e is non-null, then define v = \u03c3 + v\u221e /(v\u221e , v\u221e ). Then (v, v\u221e ) = 0 and (v, v) =\n\u22a5 : (v, v) =\n\u22121/(v\u221e , v\u221e ), so that x 7\u2192 v(x) is a local diffeomorphism from M to {v \u2208 v\u221e\n2\n2\n\u00b1r }, where 1/r = |(v\u221e , v\u221e )|, which is a hyperboloid or a sphere of radius r according to\nwhether (v\u221e , v\u221e ) is positive or negative. Since dX v = dX \u03c3, this local diffeomorphism is\nan isometry.\n\u2022 If v\u221e is null, let v0 be another constant null vector with (v0 , v\u221e ) = \u22121 and identify\n{v0 , v\u221e }\u22a5 with euclidean Rn . Then the stereographic projection or stereoprojection\n(7.3)\n\n\u03c3 7\u2192 v = pr Rn \u03c3 = \u03c3 \u2212 v0 + (\u03c3, v0 )v\u221e\n\nis a local diffeomorphism from M to Rn with inverse\n(7.4)\n\nv 7\u2192 \u03c3 = exp(v \u2227 v\u221e ) * v0 = v + v0 + 21 (v, v)v\u221e .\n\nSince (dX \u03c3, v\u221e ) = 0, we have (dX v, dY v) = (dX \u03c3, dY \u03c3) = g(X, Y ) and so stereoprojection\nis also an isometry for the metric g induced by \u03c3. This proves that flat conformal Cartan\ngeometries are conformally flat in the usual sense, the charts given by stereoprojection\nbeing conformal. Furthermore, these charts are not just conformal, but M\u00f6bius (which is\nonly an issue for curves and surfaces): since Hc l = 0 = Sc l (i.e., r g = 0), the flat M\u00f6bius\nstructure given by the flat metric on Rn pulls back to the flat M\u00f6bius structure on S n .\n7.3. Symmetry breaking. The introduction of a constant vector v\u221e \u2208 Rn+1,1 breaks\nsymmetry from the M\u00f6bius group of S n to the isometry group Stab(v\u221e ) of a spaceform\n(or the homothety group in the flat case). Such constant vectors sometimes arise naturally\nin conformal submanifold geometry. Let us study, more generally, a constant (k + 1)-plane\nW (or equivalently a constant decomposable (k + 1)-vector \u03c9 up to scale) for 0 6 k 6 n.\n\u2022 If the induced metric on W is nondegenerate, then replacing W by W \u22a5 and k by n \u2212 k if\nnecessary, we may assume that W has signature (k, 1) and W \u22a5 has signature (n \u2212 k + 1, 0).\nNow any null vector \u03c3 not in W can be scaled so that \u03c3 = w + x where w is a positively\noriented timelike unit vector in W and x is spacelike unit vector in W \u22a5 , both uniquely\ndetermined. This defines an isometry from (Hk + W \u22a5 ) \u2229 L to Hk \u00d7 S n\u2212k , where Hk is\n(the positive sheet of) the hyperboloid in W , and Hk \u00d7 S n\u2212k is equipped with a product\nof constant curvature metrics. Hence we obtain a conformal diffeomorphism from P(L) r\nP(W \u2229 L), i.e., S n r S k\u22121 , to Hk \u00d7 S n\u2212k .\n\u2022 If the induced metric on W is degenerate, i.e., W has signature (k, 0) and W \u22a5 has\nsignature (n \u2212 k, 0), then W \u2229 W \u22a5 = W \u2229 L = W \u22a5 \u2229 L is a null line spanned by a null\nvector \u0175. If w0 is another null vector with (\u0175, w0 ) = \u22121 then any null vector \u03c3 not in\nthe span of W is a constant multiple of w0 + \u03bb\u0175 + x + y for unique x \u2208 W \u2229 \u01750\u22a5 and\ny \u2208 W \u22a5 \u2229 \u01750\u22a5 , identifying (w0 + W + W \u22a5 ) \u2229 L isometrically with a product Rk \u00d7 Rn\u2212k of\neuclidean spaces. Up to translation and scale this isometry is independent of the choice of\nw0 and \u0175, we have a conformal diffeomorphism from S n r {pt } to Rk \u00d7 Rn\u2212k .\n\nAs in the case of vectors, the choice W induces a Weyl structure \u039b\u0302, hence a compatible\nmetric (up to homothety), on the open subset of S n where \u039b 6\u2286 W, W \u22a5 such that \u039b \u2295 \u039b\u0302 is\nthe (1, 1)-plane (\u03a3 \u00d7 W \u2295 \u039b) \u2229 (\u03a3 \u00d7 W \u22a5 \u2295 \u039b) on this open subset: in the nondegenerate\ncase, \u039b\u0302 = \u03c1W \u039b where \u03c1W = id W \u2212 id W \u22a5 ; in the degenerate case \u039b\u0302 = W \u2229 W \u22a5 = <\u0175> is\nconstant. Since \u03a3 \u00d7 W \u22a5 \u2229 (\u039b \u2295 \u039b\u0302) is a constant line inside \u03a3 \u00d7 W \u2295 \u039b\u0302 (and similarly for\n\u03a3 \u00d7 W \u2229 (\u039b \u2295 \u039b\u0302) inside \u03a3 \u00d7 W \u22a5 \u2295 \u039b\u0302), \u039b\u0302 is the Weyl structure of the product of constant\ncurvature metrics.\n\n\f32\n\nFRANCIS E. BURSTALL AND DAVID M. J. CALDERBANK\n\nIf we view the representative \u03c9 \u2208 \u2227k+1 W as a constant (k + 1)-vector on S n , then its Lie\nalgebra homology class [\u03c9] defines a section of H0 (T \u2217S n , S n \u00d7 \u2227k+1 Rn+1,1 ), which turns out\nto be the bundle \u2227k (T S n \u039b) L \u223c\n= \u2227k T \u2217S n Lk+1 and [\u03c9] is a decomposable section tangent\nto one of the factors of the product structure. The equation d\u03c9 = 0, viewed as an equation\non [\u03c9] implies that the latter is a conformal Killing form in the sense of [69].\nThis symmetry breaking is particularly straightforward when k = 1: a decomposable 2form \u03c9 identifies S n r S n\u22122 , S n r {pt} or S n r S 0 with S 1 \u00d7 Hn\u22121 , R \u00d7 Rn\u22121 or H1 \u00d7 S n\u22121\nrespectively, according to whether \u03c9 is spacelike, null, or timelike, respectively (i.e., whether\nthe corresponding 2-plane is euclidean, degenerate, or lorentzian respectively). Note that \u03c9\nmay also be viewed as an element of so(n+1, 1), i.e., an infinitesimal M\u00f6bius transformation\nof S n , its Lie algebra homology class [\u03c9] being the vector field generating this action. Since\n\u03c9 is a wedge product of two vectors in W , it follows that [\u03c9] generates of the obvious S 1\nor R action on S 1 \u00d7 Hn\u22121 , R \u00d7 Rn\u22121 or H1 \u00d7 S n\u22121 .\nPart II. Submanifolds and The Conformal Bonnet Theorem\nNow we come to the heart of the matter: an immersed submanifold of a M\u00f6bius manifold\ninherits a conformal M\u00f6bius structure in a canonical way. In particular, a curve or surface\nimmersed in a conformal n-manifold with n > 3 acquires more intrinsic geometry from the\nambient space than merely a conformal metric.\nThe key ingredient of our theory is the notion of a M\u00f6bius reduction, introduced in \u00a78.2\nas a reduction of structure group along a submanifold \u03a3 immersed in a M\u00f6bius manifold\nM . In \u00a78.3, we show that this generalizes the classical notion of an enveloped sphere\ncongruence. In \u00a79.1 we compute the data induced on \u03a3 by a M\u00f6bius reduction, and then\nin \u00a79.2, using a gauge theoretic interpretation of M\u00f6bius reductions, we show how these\ndata depend on the choice of M\u00f6bius reduction.\nOne of these data is an analogue of the second fundamental form (or shape operator) in\nriemannian geometry (we make the analogy precise in \u00a711.3) and this datum only depends\non the M\u00f6bius reduction through its trace, a generalized mean curvature conormal vector.\nThis allows us to achieve our first goal in \u00a79.3, where we show that there is a unique M\u00f6bius\nreduction whose second fundamental form is tracefree. By normalizing the induced Cartan\nconnection, we thus obtain a canonical conformal Cartan geometry on \u03a3.\nFor submanifolds of the conformal n-sphere, the canonical M\u00f6bius reduction is the central\nsphere congruence [8]. In this case, we show in \u00a710.2 that the primitive data induced\non \u03a3 by the reduction suffice to recover the ambient flat conformal Cartan connection.\nAs we show in \u00a710.3, this leads at once to a conformal Bonnet theorem, and we present\ntwo approaches to the Gauss\u2013Codazzi\u2013Ricci equations characterizing conformal immersions.\nThe first, introduced in \u00a710.4, is an unashamedly abstract treatment using Lie algebra\nhomology and the Bernstein\u2013Gelfand\u2013Gelfand machinery of [25]. The second, presented\nin \u00a711.5, uses the decomposition with respect to a Weyl structure (described and studied\nin in \u00a7\u00a711.1\u201311.4) to give a more explicit formulation.\nIn \u00a712.1, we specialize our theory to curves and study their M\u00f6bius invariants. We turn\nto surfaces in \u00a712.2, where, with an eye on the applications in Part III, we study quadratic\ndifferentials and the relation between the differential lift and the Hodge star operator. We\nalso relate our theory to the work of [18, 21].\n8. Submanifolds and M\u00f6bius reductions\n8.1. Submanifolds of M\u00f6bius manifolds. Let \u03c6 : \u03a3 \u2192 M be an immersion of an mmanifold \u03a3 into a M\u00f6bius n-manifold M , with n = m + k and m, k > 0. Thus, for n > 3,\nour assumption is no more than that M be a conformal manifold: it is only for the case\n\n\fCONFORMAL SUBMANIFOLD GEOMETRY I\u2013III\n\n33\n\nof curves immersed in surfaces that we are imposing extra structure on the ambient space.\nIn any case, M is equipped with a normal conformal Cartan geometry (VM , \u039b, DM ).\nThe conformal metric on M restricts to give a conformal metric on \u03a3. At first we obtain\na section of S 2 T \u2217\u03a3 (LM |\u03a3 )2 , but then Proposition 1.4 identifies LM |\u03a3 with the density\nbundle L\u03a3 of \u03a3. (To generalize our theory to indefinite signature metrics we need to\nassume that the induced conformal metric on \u03a3 is nondegenerate.) Henceforth, we write\nL and \u039b = L\u22121 for both the intrinsic and ambient line bundles, and often omit restriction\nmaps (pullbacks to \u03a3). Thus (VM , DM ) will be viewed as a vector bundle with connection\nover \u03a3. Along \u03a3, we have an orthogonal decomposition\nT M = T \u03a3 \u2295 N \u03a3,\nwhere N \u03a3 is the normal bundle to \u03a3 in M . Further, the operators \u03c0 and p, defined by\nthe soldering isomorphism of M , restrict to operators along \u03a3, so that in particular, we\nhave \u03c0 : \u039b\u22a5 \u2192 T M \u039b(\u223c\n= T \u2217M L) over \u03a3. We thus obtain two subbundles \u03c0 \u22121 (N \u03a3 \u039b) and\n\u22121\n\u03c0 (T \u03a3 \u039b) of VM with sum \u039b\u22a5 and intersection \u039b. We denote the latter subbundle by\n\u039b(1) : it is the smallest subbundle of \u039b\u22a5 containing \u039b and its tangential first derivatives,\n(1) for all sections \u03c3 of \u039b and X \u2208 T \u03a3.\ni.e., DM\nX\u03c3 \u2208\u039b\nOur approach to M\u00f6bius submanifold geometry is to forget about M and study only\n(VM , \u039b, DM ) along \u03a3. This will be particularly effective in the case M = S n , since then\nVM (restricted to \u03a3) is \u03a3 \u00d7 Rn+1,1 with DM just the flat derivative d, and the immersion\nof \u03a3 into S n = P(L) can be recovered from the subbundle \u039b \u2282 \u03a3 \u00d7 Rn+1,1 (whose fibres\nare null lines in Rn+1,1 , hence points in P(L)).\n8.2. M\u00f6bius reductions. We regard (VM , \u039b, DM ) as a generalized conformal Cartan\ngeometry on \u03a3. It is not actually a conformal Cartan geometry, since VM has rank n + 2 >\nm + 2 so a reduction of structure group is required. This prompts the following definition.\nDefinition 8.1. A signature (m + 1, 1) subbundle V \u2282 VM (over \u03a3) is called a M\u00f6bius\nreduction iff V contains the rank m + 1 bundle \u039b(1) (so that \u039b(1) = \u039b\u22a5 \u2229 V ).\nOtherwise said, V \u22a5 is a complement to \u039b in \u03c0 \u22121 (N \u03a3 \u039b) \u2282 \u039b\u22a5 , or equivalently, an\northogonal complement to \u039b(1) in \u039b\u22a5 . From this, it is clear that M\u00f6bius reductions exist\nand that V \u22a5 is a rank k bundle on which the metric is definite. Also \u03c0 : \u039b\u22a5 \u2192 T M \u039b\nrestricts to a metric isomorphism from V \u22a5 onto the weightless normal bundle N \u03a3 \u039b.\nA M\u00f6bius reduction V determines and is determined by a bundle map IV : N \u03a3 \u039b \u2192\n\u03c0 \u22121 (N \u03a3 \u039b) \u2282 \u039b\u22a5 with \u03c0 \u25e6 IV = id N \u03a3 \u039b via V \u22a5 = im IV . It follows that M\u00f6bius reductions\nform an affine space modelled on the sections of Hom(N \u03a3 \u039b, \u039b) \u223c\n= N \u2217\u03a3. We write V 7\u2192\n\u221e\n\u2217\nV + \u03bd for this affine structure, where \u03bd \u2208 C (\u03a3, N \u03a3): explicitly, IV +\u03bd = IV \u2212 \u03bd \u2297 id \u039b .\n(The sign here is for consistency with our sign convention for Weyl structures.)\n8.3. Sphere congruences. When M = S n , M\u00f6bius reductions admit a classical interpretation. In this case, VM \u2192 \u03a3 is just the trivial Rn+1,1 bundle, DM is flat differentiation\nd, and the line bundle \u039b \u2192 \u03a3 is the pullback of the tautological bundle by the immersion\n\u03c6 : \u03a3 \u2192 S n . Positive sections of \u039b are precisely the lifts f : \u03a3 \u2192 L+ of \u03c6 with q \u25e6 f = \u03c6.\nRecall from \u00a71A that l-spheres in the conformal sphere S n = P(L) correspond bijectively\nto signature (l + 1, 1) subspaces of Rn+1,1 (or equivalently to the orthogonal spacelike\n(n \u2212 l)-planes) via W 7\u2192 P(W \u2229 L). Hence the space of l-spheres in S n is identified with\nthe grassmannian of signature (l + 1, 1) subspaces of Rn+1,1 , and a signature (l + 1, 1)\nsubbundle of \u03a3 \u00d7 Rn+1,1 is the same as a map of \u03a3 into this space.\nDefinition 8.2. A l-sphere congruence parameterized by an m-manifold \u03a3 is a signature\n(l + 1, 1) subbundle V of \u03a3 \u00d7 Rn+1,1 . It is said to be enveloped by an immersion \u03c6, i.e.,\n\n\f34\n\nFRANCIS E. BURSTALL AND DAVID M. J. CALDERBANK\n\na null line subbundle \u039b satisfying the Cartan condition, iff \u039b(1) \u2282 V , i.e., V contains the\nimage of every lift f and its first derivatives dX f , X \u2208 T \u03a3.\nGeometrically, the enveloping condition means that each l-sphere P(Vx \u2229 L) has first\norder contact with \u03c6(\u03a3) at \u03c6(x). When l = m, this is exactly the condition that V be a\nM\u00f6bius reduction for \u039b. To summarize:\nM\u00f6bius reductions are the same as m-sphere congruences enveloped by \u03a3.\n9. Geometry of M\u00f6bius reductions\n9.1. Splitting of the ambient connection. Let V a M\u00f6bius reduction of VM along \u03a3.\nThe orthogonal decomposition VM = V \u2295 V \u22a5 induces a decomposition of DM : we have\nmetric connections DV , \u2207V on V , V \u22a5 , respectively, given by composing the restriction of\nDM with orthoprojection. The remaining, off-diagonal, part of DM is the following.\nDefinition 9.1. The M\u00f6bius differential N V : T \u03a3 \u2192 Hom(V, V \u22a5 ) \u2295 Hom(V \u22a5 , V ) of a\nM\u00f6bius reduction V is defined by\n\u22a5\nNXV v = (DM\nX v) ,\n\n\u22a4\nNXV \u03be = (DM\nX \u03be) ,\n\nfor v \u2208 V , \u03be \u2208 V \u22a5 , where \u22a4 , \u22a5 denote the orthoprojections onto V, V \u22a5 respectively.\n\nNote that N V is zero order in v, \u03be, and (NXV \u03be, v) = \u2212(\u03be, NXV v) since DM is a metric\nconnection. In Lie-theoretic terms, we have a fibrewise symmetric decomposition\ng := so(VM ) = hV \u2295 mV ,\n\n(9.1)\nwhere\n\nhV = so(V ) \u2295 so(V \u22a5 ),\n\nAccordingly DM decomposes as\n\n\u0001\nmV = g \u2229 Hom(V, V \u22a5 ) \u2295 Hom(V \u22a5 , V ) .\n\nDM = D\u2207,V + N V ,\n\n(9.2)\n\nwhere D\u2207,V = DV + \u2207V is the direct sum connection and N V is a mV -valued 1-form.\nThe fundamental tools in submanifold geometry are the equations which give the curvature of DM in terms of this decomposition:\nM\n\n\u2207,V\n\n(9.3a)\n\n(RD )h = RD\n\n(9.3b)\n\n(RD )m = d D\n\nM\n\n\u2207,V\n\n+ 12 [N V \u2227 N V ];\n\nNV .\n\nWe shall see that the so(V ) and so(V \u22a5 ) components of (9.3a) are generalized versions of the\nGauss and Ricci equations respectively, while (9.3b) is a Codazzi equation. As they stand,\nthese equations are conceptually simple and general: VM could be any vector bundle with\ng connection and V any nondegenerate subbundle. However, they depend on the choice of\nM\u00f6bius reduction and we need to understand this dependence. First, though, there is a lot\nof information hidden in the interaction with the tautological line bundle \u039b, which we now\nbegin to unravel.\nLet V a M\u00f6bius reduction of (VM , \u039b, DM ) along \u03a3. Then \u039b(1) \u2282 V , so that DM\nX\u03c3 \u2208 V\nand thus\nNXV \u03c3 = 0,\nDVX \u03c3 = DM\nX \u03c3,\nfor all sections \u03c3 of \u039b and X \u2208 T \u03a3. This has several consequences for the components\nDV , \u2207V and N V of DM . First, DV is a conformal Cartan connection for the conformal\nstructure on \u03a3 inherited from M : the soldering form of DV is the pullback of that of DM .\nIn particular, \u03c0|\u039b(1) is the operator \u03c0\u03a3 : \u039b(1) \u2192 T \u03a3 \u039b defined by the soldering form of DV ,\nand we shall drop the subscript henceforth.\nDV\nDM\nMoreover, DVX \u03c3 = DM\nX \u03c3 implies that RX,Y \u03c3 is the projection onto V of RX,Y \u03c3 which\nvanishes since DM is strongly torsion-free. We summarize this as follows.\n\n\fCONFORMAL SUBMANIFOLD GEOMETRY I\u2013III\n\n35\n\nProposition 9.2. (V, \u039b, DV ) is a conformal Cartan geometry on \u03a3 whose induced conformal metric is the restriction of the conformal metric on M .\nV\n\nThus in addition to a conformal metric, \u03a3 acquires a M\u00f6bius structure MV := MD .\nWhen dim \u03a3 6 2, this packs a punch as we shall see.\nNow contemplate N V : since N V |\u039b vanishes, N V takes values in stab(\u039b) \u2229 mV so that\n\u03c0N V is a tensorial object: a 1-form with values in co(T M ).\nDefinition 9.3. The second fundamental form and shape operator of a M\u00f6bius reduction\nV are the bundle maps IIV : T \u03a3 \u2297 T \u03a3 \u2192 N \u03a3 and SV : T \u03a3 \u2297 N \u03a3 \u2192 T \u03a3 defined in terms\nof the M\u00f6bius differential N V by the following formulae:\n\u0001\nIIVX Y \u03c3 = \u2212\u03c0 NXV (DM\nhSVX U, Y i\u03c3 2 = (NXV IV (U \u2297 \u03c3), DM\nY \u03c3) ,\nY \u03c3);\n\nthus SV \u2208 \u03a91 (\u03a3, Hom(N \u03a3, T \u03a3)) is the transpose of IIV \u2208 \u03a91 (\u03a3, Hom(T \u03a3, N \u03a3)) and\n\u03c0N V = IIV \u2212 SV . The mean curvature covector H V \u2208 C\u221e (\u03a3, N \u2217\u03a3) of V is given by\n1\n1\ntr SV = m\nhtr c IIV , *i.\nHV = m\nProposition 9.4. Let V be a M\u00f6bius reduction of VM on \u03a3. Then IIV is symmetric, i.e.,\nis a section of S 2 T \u2217\u03a3 \u2297 N \u03a3. (Equivalently SV is a section of N \u2217\u03a3 \u2297 Symc (T \u03a3).)\nProof. We have\nM\n\nV\nM\nD\n\u22a5\n(IIVY X \u2212 IIVX Y )\u03c3 = \u03c0(NXV (DM\nY \u03c3) \u2212 NY (DX \u03c3)) = \u03c0((RX,Y \u03c3) ) = 0\n\nsince DM is torsion-free.\n\n\u0003\n\nFinally \u2207V induces a metric connection \u2207 = \u03c0 \u25e6 \u2207V \u25e6 IV on N \u03a3 \u039b.\nWe now see how all these data depend on the choice of reduction V which will require a\ncloser look at the space of M\u00f6bius reductions.\n9.2. Gauge theory of M\u00f6bius reductions. The affine structure on the space of M\u00f6bius\nreductions may be usefully understood in terms of gauge transformations of VM : we have\nV + \u03bd = exp(\u2212\u03bd)V . Indeed, for v \u2208 VM , U \u2297 \u03c3 \u2208 N \u03a3 \u039b, we compute\nexp(\u2212\u03bd)IV (U \u2297 \u03c3) = IV (U \u2297 \u03c3) \u2212 \u03bd * IV (U \u2297 \u03c3) = IV (U \u2297 \u03c3) \u2212 h\u03bd, U i\u03c3 = IV +\u03bd (U \u2297 \u03c3)\n\nso that exp(\u2212\u03bd) \u25e6 IV = IV +\u03bd . Thus if v \u2208 V + \u03bd, exp(\u03bd)v \u2208 V .\nProposition 9.5. Let V be a M\u00f6bius reduction of VM on \u03a3. Then, for \u03bd \u2208 C\u221e (\u03a3, N \u2217\u03a3),\n(9.4)\n\nexp(\u03bd) * DV +\u03bd = DV + [[\u03bd, \u03c0N V ]] \u2212 12 [[\u03bd, \u03c0D\u2207,V \u03bd]],\n\nexp(\u03bd) * N V +\u03bd = N V \u2212 D\u2207,V \u03bd,\nexp(\u03bd) * \u2207V +\u03bd = \u2207V ,\n\nand [N V , \u03bd] \u2212 12 [\u03bd, D\u2207,V \u03bd], D\u2207,V \u03bd take values in stab(\u039b)\u22a5 \u2229 hV , stab(\u039b) \u2229 mV respectively.\nProof. From (3.2), we have exp(\u03bd) * DM = DM \u2212DM \u03bd \u2212 21 [[\u03bd, \u03c0DM \u03bd]]. Now DM \u03bd = D\u2207,V \u03bd +\n[N V , \u03bd] = D\u2207,V \u03bd \u2212[[\u03bd, \u03c0N V ]], since N V takes values in stab(\u039b). In particular, \u03c0[N V , \u03bd] = 0.\nSince V + \u03bd = exp(\u2212\u03bd)V , exp(\u03bd) * D\u2207,V is the reduction of exp(\u03bd) * DM to hV , whence\n\u0001\nexp(\u03bd) * D\u2207,V +\u03bd = exp(\u03bd) * DM h = D\u2207,V + [[\u03bd, \u03c0N V ]] \u2212 12 [[\u03bd, \u03c0D\u2207,V \u03bd]],\nV\n\u0001\nV +\u03bd\nM\nexp(\u03bd) * N\n= exp(\u03bd) * D m = N V \u2212 D\u2207,V \u03bd.\nV\n\n(9.4) follows after restricting the first of these formulae to V and V \u22a5 .\n\n\u0003\n\nWith this in hand, we can determine the dependence of our data on the M\u00f6bius reduction.\n\n\f36\n\nFRANCIS E. BURSTALL AND DAVID M. J. CALDERBANK\n\nProposition 9.6. The conformal structure c on \u03a3 and connection \u2207 on N \u03a3 \u039b are independent of V , whereas\n(9.5)\n(9.6)\n\nMV +\u03bd = MV + \u03bd(IIV ) \u2212 21 h\u03bd, \u03bdic,\n\nIIV +\u03bd = IIV \u2212 c \u2297 \u03bd,\n\nSV +\u03bd = SV \u2212 \u03bd \u2297 id.\n\nProof. The independence of the conformal structure is immediate from Proposition 9.2.\nMoreover, since \u03c0 \u25e6 exp(\u03bd) = \u03c0, we have \u03c0 \u25e6 \u2207V +\u03bd \u25e6 IV +\u03bd = \u03c0 \u25e6 exp(\u03bd) * \u2207V +\u03bd \u25e6 IV which is\n\u03c0 \u25e6 \u2207V \u25e6 IV by Proposition 9.5. Thus \u2207 is independent of V .\nSimilarly, \u03c0N V +\u03bd = \u03c0(exp(\u03bd) * N V +\u03bd ) = \u03c0N V \u2212 \u03c0D\u2207,V \u03bd by Proposition 9.5. Moreover\n(9.7)\n\n\u03c0D\u2207,V \u03bd = \u2212[[id, \u03bd]] = id \u2297 \u03bd \u2212 c \u2297 \u03bd\n\nand so (9.6) follows since IIV \u2212 SV = \u03c0N V .\nFinally, for (9.5), note that DV +\u03bd is gauge-equivalent to DV + [[\u03bd, \u03c0N V ]] \u2212 12 [[\u03bd, \u03c0D\u2207,V \u03bd]]\nby Proposition 9.5, so that these connections induce the same M\u00f6bius structures, namely\nMV + [[\u03bd, \u03c0N V ]] \u2212 12 [[\u03bd, \u03c0DhV \u03bd]]. Moreover,\n[[\u03bd, \u03c0N V ]] = [[\u03bd, IIV \u2212 SV ]] = \u03bd(IIV ),\n\n[[\u03bd, \u03c0D\u2207,V \u03bd]] = \u2212[[\u03bd, [[id, \u03bd]]]] = h\u03bd, \u03bdic,\n(using (9.7)), whence (9.5) follows.\n\n\u0003\n\n9.3. Normalization and the primitive data. The submanifold geometry developed\nthus far is not a pure theory of conformal submanifolds as it depends on the choice of\na M\u00f6bius reduction. Furthermore, there is no reason for the induced conformal Cartan\ngeometry to be normal. The key to rectifying this is equation (9.6), which shows that the\ntracefree part II0 of the second fundamental form IIV (or equivalently the tracefree part S0\nof the shape operator SV ) is independent of the choice of V , whereas the mean curvature\ndepends on V via H V +\u03bd = H V \u2212 \u03bd. Hence there is a unique M\u00f6bius reduction with\ntracefree second fundamental form-i.e., vanishing mean curvature-given by V + H V =\nexp(\u2212H V )V for any M\u00f6bius reduction V .\nDefinition 9.7. The unique M\u00f6bius reduction V\u03a3 with H V\u03a3 = 0 will be called the canonical\nM\u00f6bius reduction. We denote the M\u00f6bius differential of V\u03a3 by N and identify V\u03a3 with\nN \u03a3 \u039b so that \u2207V\u03a3 = \u2207. We also write h for hV\u03a3 and m for mV\u03a3 so that g = h \u2295 m.\nThe canonical M\u00f6bius reduction is picked out by a homological condition: for any reduction V , N V is a 1-chain in the complex defining the Lie algebra homology H\u2022 (T \u2217\u03a3, mV )\n(where the standard action on V and the trivial action on V \u22a5 are used to define the\nso(V )-module structure on mV ). Applying the boundary operator to this 1-chain gives\nP\nP\nP\n\u2202N V = i [\u03b5i , NeVi ] = i [[\u03b5i , \u03c0NeVi ]] = i [[\u03b5i , IIVei \u2212 SVei ]] = \u2212 tr SV .\n\nThus V\u03a3 is the unique reduction whose M\u00f6bius differential is a 1-cycle. When m = 1, N\nis a section of T \u2217\u03a3 \u2297 N \u2217\u03a3, which we shall call the conformal acceleration A of the curve.\nWe now have a canonical choice (V\u03a3 , \u039b, DV\u03a3 ) of conformal Cartan geometry on \u03a3. The\nremaining problem is that the associated M\u00f6bius structure need not be a conformal M\u00f6bius\nstructure, that is, DV\u03a3 need not be normal (when m > 2). But now Proposition 5.11 comes\nto the rescue and assures us of a unique section Q of S 2 T \u2217\u03a3 such that\n\u2022 DV\u03a3 \u2212 Q is a normal Cartan connection;\n\u2022 Q0 = 0 when m = 2 and Q = 0 when m = 1 (i.e., Q is in the image of \u2202).\nWe denote the normal Cartan connection so defined by D\u03a3 = DV\u03a3 \u2212 Q and the induced\nconformal M\u00f6bius structure by M\u03a3 = MV\u03a3 \u2212 Q.\n\n\fCONFORMAL SUBMANIFOLD GEOMETRY I\u2013III\n\n37\n\nTheorem 9.8. Let \u03c6 : \u03a3 \u2192 M be an immersion of an m-manifold \u03a3 into a M\u00f6bius nmanifold M . Then \u03c6 equips \u03a3 canonically with the following primitive data:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\na\na\na\na\n\nconformal M\u00f6bius structure (c, M\u03a3 );\nrank n \u2212 m euclidean vector bundle N \u03a3 \u039b with a metric connection \u2207;\nsection II0 of S02 T \u2217\u03a3 \u2297 N \u03a3 for m > 2;\nsection A of T \u2217\u03a3 \u2297 N \u2217\u03a3 for m = 1.\n\nIn addition there is an affine bijection V 7\u2192 \u2212H V from M\u00f6bius reductions to sections of\nN \u2217\u03a3 such that the inverse image of zero is the canonical M\u00f6bius reduction.\nIt is not immediately apparent that these data suffice to recover the connection DM =\n+ \u2207 + Q + N on VM = V\u03a3 \u2295 V\u03a3\u22a5 , but we shall see that they do when DM is flat.\nThe primitive data can be computed from an arbitrary M\u00f6bius reduction V by writing\nV = V\u03a3 \u2212 H V and applying Proposition 9.6 to see that V gives the same conformal metric\nand normal connection as V\u03a3 , whereas the remaining data are related by\n\nD\u03a3\n\n(9.8)\n(9.9)\n(9.10)\n(9.11)\n\nII0 = IIV \u2212 c \u2297 H V ,\n\nA = N V \u2212 D\u2207,V H V\n\nS0 = SV \u2212 id \u2297 H V\n\nM\u03a3 = MV\u03a3 \u2212 Q = MV \u2212 QV ,\nV\n\nV\n\nV\n\nQ : = Q \u2212 H (II ) +\n\nV 2\n1\n2 |H | c\n\n(m > 2)\n(m = 1)\nwhere\n\nV\n\n0\n\n= Q \u2212 H (II ) \u2212\n\nV 2\n1\n2 |H | c.\n\nWe can also decompose DM on V \u2295 V \u22a5 as DM = D\u03a3,V + \u2207V + QV + N V , where D\u03a3,V =\nDV \u2212 QV is the normal Cartan connection exp(H V ) * D\u03a3 on V .\nTo summarize, given a submanifold \u03c6 : \u03a3 \u2192 M and a M\u00f6bius reduction V , we have a\ndecomposition of the ambient Cartan connection\nD M = D h V + QV + N V\n\n(9.12)\n\nwhere DhV := D\u03a3,V +\u2207V for a normal conformal Cartan connection D\u03a3,V . By the formulae\nabove, this decomposition induces the primitive data of Theorem 9.8. The curvature of\nDM with respect to this decomposition is given by:\n(9.13a)\n(9.13b)\n\nM\n\n(RD )hV = RhV + d hV QV + 12 [N V \u2227 N V ];\nM\n\n(RD )mV = d hV N V + [QV \u2227 N V ].\n\nHere d hV is the exterior derivative coupled to DhV , and RhV is the curvature of DhV .\n10. Lie algebra homology and the conformal Bonnet theorem\nWe now specialize to the case that the ambient manifold M is the conformal sphere S n\nso that VM is the trivial Rn+1,1 -bundle over \u03a3 and DM = d. In this setting, we will see\nthat the immersion \u039b of \u03a3 is completely determined by the primitive data of Theorem 9.8.\nIt follows that the equations of (9.13), with V = V\u03a3 , are equations on these data, the\nGauss\u2013Codazzi\u2013Ricci equations. Furthermore, we shall see that one can recover (locally)\nan immersion of \u03a3 into S n from an arbitrary solution of these equations. In all this, we\nmake substantial use of the machinery of Lie algebra homology and the associated theory\nof Bernstein\u2013Gelfand\u2013Gelfand operators. The Reader with no taste for such abstraction is\ndirected to section 11 where Weyl structures are used to provide a more explicit formulation.\nBefore all this, however, we show that the canonical M\u00f6bius reduction is an object wellknown to conformal submanifold geometers.\n\n\f38\n\nFRANCIS E. BURSTALL AND DAVID M. J. CALDERBANK\n\n10.1. The central sphere congruence. For M = S n , we identified M\u00f6bius reductions\nwith the classical notion of enveloped sphere congruences in \u00a78.3. The canonical M\u00f6bius\nreduction is also known classically: it is central sphere congruence or conformal Gauss\nmap [10, 76] which may be defined in terms of a lift f : \u03a3 \u2192 L+ by\nVcent = <f, df, tr Ddf >.\nHere D is the Levi-Civita connection of (df, df ), which is also used to compute\nP the trace.\nEquivalently, if ei \u2297 f is an orthonormal basis of T \u03a3 \u039b, Vcent = <f, df, i dei dei f >.\nP\nP\n\u22a5\nNow\ni dei dei f to be\ni Nei (dei f ), \u03c0 of which is\nP we0 compute the V\u03a3 component of\n\u2212 i IIei ei f = 0. Thus Vcent = V\u03a3 .\nMore geometrically, \u03a3(x) := P((V\u03a3 )x \u2229 L) is the mean curvature sphere, i.e., the unique\nsphere tangent to \u03a3 at x, which has the same mean curvature covector as \u03a3 with respect\nto some (hence any) enveloped sphere congruences V of \u03a3 and V(x) of \u03a3(x) which agree\nat x. Indeed, the central sphere congruence of \u03a3(x) is clearly constant, equal to (V\u03a3 )x\n(the M\u00f6bius differential is zero, which is certainly a cycle). Hence \u03a3 and \u03a3(x) have central\nsphere congruences which agree at x. As we shall in \u00a711.3, it follows that \u03a3 and \u03a3(x) have\nthe same mean curvature covector at x with respect to some (hence any) ambient metric.\n10.2. Lifting the primitive data. Consider an immersion \u03c6 : \u03a3 \u2192 S n with central\nsphere congruence (i.e., canonical M\u00f6bius reduction) V\u03a3 . Then, using the decomposition\ng = h \u2295 m induced by \u03a3 \u00d7 Rn+1,1 = V\u03a3 \u2295 V\u03a3\u22a5 , (9.12) specializes to give\n(10.1)\n\nd = Dh + Q + N ,\n\nwhere Dh is the h-connection D\u03a3 + \u2207, N \u2208 \u03a91 (\u03a3, m), and Q is the unique section of\nS 2 T \u2217\u03a3 \u2229 im \u2202 for which D\u03a3 is normal.\nh\nWrite d h for d D and Rh for the curvature of Dh . Then (9.13) specializes as follows:\n(10.2a)\n(10.2b)\n\n0 = Rh + d h Q + 12 [N \u2227 N ];\n0 = d h N + [Q \u2227 N ].\n\nRecall that our normalization conditions on the M\u00f6bius reduction V\u03a3 and the M\u00f6bius\nstructure M\u03a3 amount to the requirement that Rh and N are cycles in Z2 (\u03a3, h) and Z1 (\u03a3, m)\n\u03a3\nrespectively (the former condition is equivalent to RD being a cycle). Moreover, we see\nthat the homology class of N yields primitive data:\n(\nII0 \u2212 S0 for m > 2;\n[N ] =\nA\nfor m = 1.\n(\n\u0001\nS02 T \u2217\u03a3 \u2297 N \u03a3 \u2295 Symc (T \u03a3) \u2297 N \u2217\u03a3 \u2229 \u03a91 (\u03a3, co(T M )) for m > 2;\n\u2217\nH1 (T \u03a3, m) =\nT \u2217\u03a3 \u2297 N \u2217\u03a3 \u2282 \u03a91 (\u03a3, T \u2217M )\nfor m = 1.\n\u03a3\n\nThis is analogous to the primitive data given by the homology class [RD ], which is the\nWeyl curvature of (\u03a3, c) when m > 4 and the Cotton\u2013York curvature of (\u03a3, c) or (\u03a3, c, M\u03a3 )\nwhen m = 3 or m = 2 respectively.\nWe now show that both N and Q can be recovered from these homology classes, from\nwhich it will follow that the Gauss\u2013Codazzi\u2013Ricci equations (10.2) are equations on these\ndata. In \u00a710.4, we shall realize these equations in terms of Bernstein\u2013Gelfand\u2013Gelfand\n(BGG) differential operators on Lie algebra homology bundles. A key ingredient is the\ndifferential lift [25, 35] associated to D\u03a3 that we introduced in \u00a74A. We let \u0003 h denote \u0003 D\u03a3\ncoupled to the connection \u2207 on V\u03a3\u22a5 , to obtain a generalized differential lift j h which can\nbe applied to homology classes, such as [N ], with a normal component.\n\n\fCONFORMAL SUBMANIFOLD GEOMETRY I\u2013III\n\n39\n\nProposition 10.1. Let (V\u03a3 , \u039b, D\u03a3 ) be a normal conformal Cartan geometry on \u03a3, let\n(V\u03a3\u22a5 , \u2207) be a euclidean vector bundle with metric connection, let N be a m-valued 1-form\nin ker \u2202, and let Q be a h-valued 1-form in im \u2202.\nSuppose that these data satisfy the full Gauss\u2013Codazzi\u2013Ricci equations (10.2). Then\nh\n1\nQ = \u2212 21 \u0003 \u22121\nh \u2202[[[N ] \u2227 [N ]]] and N = j [N ]. Furthermore, N \u2208 \u03a9 (\u03a3, m \u2229 stab(\u039b)) and \u03c0N\nis symmetric and tracefree, whereas Q \u2208 \u03a91 (\u03a3, T \u2217\u03a3) and is symmetric.\nProof. Since \u2202Rh = 0, (10.2a) implies that \u0003 h Q = \u2202d h Q = \u2212 21 \u2202[N \u2227 N ], so that Q =\n\u2212 12 \u0003 \u22121\nh \u2202[N \u2227 N ] since it is in the image of \u2202. Now since \u2202N = 0, N takes values in\nstab(\u039b) \u2229 m and \u03c0N is tracefree. Thus Q takes values in stab(\u039b)\u22a5 \u2229 h = T \u2217\u03a3, and hence\n[Q \u2227 N ] is a 2-form with values in stab(\u039b)\u22a5 \u2229 m \u2282 Hom(V\u03a3 /\u039b\u22a5 , V\u03a3\u22a5 ) \u2295 Hom(V\u03a3\u22a5 , \u039b). Since\n\u2202 vanishes on \u039b, \u2202[Q \u2227 N ] = 0, so that (10.2b) implies \u2202d h N = 0 and hence N = j h [N ].\nWe also deduce \u2202[[id \u2227 \u03c0N ]] = 0, and then [[id \u2227 \u03c0N ]] = 0, i.e., \u03c0N is symmetric.\nIt remains to establish the symmetry of Q. Since \u0003 h Q = \u2202[[id \u2227 Q]], \u0003 h is an algebraic\nisomorphism on im \u2202, so it suffices to show that \u2202[N \u2227 N ] is symmetric. This equals\n\u2202R where R = [[\u03c0N \u2227 \u03c0N ]], which is in \u03a92 (\u03a3, so(T \u03a3)). By the Jacobi identity and the\nsymmetry of \u03c0N , R satisfies the algebraic Bianchi identity [[id \u2227 R]] = 0. It follows that its\nassociated Ricci contraction \u2202R is symmetric.\n\u0003\nWe end by noting that since Q and N are determined by the primitive data, then, given\nH V , so are QV = Q\u2212H V (II0 )\u2212 21 |H V |2 c and N V = exp(H V ) * N +DhV H V . This generality\nturns out to be convenient in applications, so we digress from the homological theory to\ngive a general formulation of the conformal Bonnet theorem.\n10.3. The conformal Bonnet theorem for enveloped sphere congruences. Let \u039b\nbe an immersion of \u03a3, and V an enveloped sphere congruence with mean curvature covector\nH V . Then (9.12) gives a decomposition of the flat connection on \u03a3 \u00d7 Rn+1,1 = V \u2295 V \u22a5 as\n(10.3)\n\nD h V + QV + N V ,\n\nwhere QV \u2208 \u03a91 (\u03a3, T \u2217\u03a3) is the unique section of S 2 T \u2217\u03a3 such that DhV restricts to the\nnormal conformal Cartan connection on V inducing the conformal M\u00f6bius structure M\u03a3 of\nthe central sphere congruence V\u03a3 = V + H V . It follows from \u00a710.2 that the primitive data\nof Theorem 9.8, together with H V , determine QV and N V . These data then satisfy Gauss\u2013\nCodazzi\u2013Ricci equations, which are equivalent to the flatness of the connection (10.3):\n(10.4a)\n(10.4b)\n\n0 = RhV + d hV QV + 12 [N V \u2227 N V ];\n0 = d hV N V + [QV \u2227 N V ].\n\nA converse is therefore available: the conformal immersion and enveloped sphere congruence\ncan be recovered from the data they induce (i.e., the primitive data of Theorem 9.8 and\nthe mean curvature covector H V ). Our goal now is to establish such a converse.\nTo this end, let \u03a3 be an m-manifold with conformal M\u00f6bius structure (c, M\u03a3 ). Suppose\nthat N \u03a3 \u2192 \u03a3 is a rank n \u2212 m vector bundle with a metric and metric connection \u2207 on\nN \u03a3 L\u22121 , and that II0 is a section of S02 T \u2217\u03a3 \u2297 N \u03a3 for m > 2 (with transpose S0 ) and A is\na section of T \u2217\u03a3 \u2297 N \u2217\u03a3 for m = 1. Finally let H V be a section of N \u2217\u03a3.\nDenote by (V, \u039b, D\u03a3,V ) the induced normal conformal Cartan geometry (which identifies\n\u039b with L\u22121 ) and set V \u22a5 = N \u03a3 \u039b, \u2207V = \u2207 and DhV = D\u03a3,V + \u2207V . Let N V = j hV (II0 \u2212\nS0 ) + DhV H V for m > 2 and N V = A + DhV H V for m = 1, where j hV is the differential\nlift operator defined by D\u03a3,V and \u2207V . Last of all, let QV be given by (9.11), where\n0\n0\n0\n0\nQ = \u2212 12 \u0003 \u22121\nh \u2202[[(II \u2212 S ) \u2227 (II \u2212 S )]].\nThen the connection (10.3) given by these data is flat iff (10.4) hold.\n\n\f40\n\nFRANCIS E. BURSTALL AND DAVID M. J. CALDERBANK\n\nTheorem 10.2. Let \u03a3 be an m-manifold with conformal M\u00f6bius structure (c, M\u03a3 ), let\n(N \u03a3 L\u22121 , \u2207) be a rank n \u2212 m euclidean vector bundle on \u03a3 with metric connection, and\nlet N V , QV be determined as above by these data together with a section H V of N \u2217\u03a3 and\na section II0 of S02 T \u2217\u03a3 \u2297 N \u03a3 (for m > 2) or A of T \u2217\u03a3 \u2297 N \u2217\u03a3 (for m = 1).\nThen there is locally an immersion of \u03a3 into S n with enveloped sphere congruence V\ninducing these data if and only if the equations of (10.4) hold. If so, then the immersion\nand enveloped sphere congruence are unique up to M\u00f6bius transformations of S n .\n(Obviously, when m = 1, the equations of this theorem are vacuous, so the theorem\nthen shows that a projective curve can be embedded into S n with arbitrary conformal\nacceleration A, and that H V parameterizes the possible enveloped circle congruences.)\nProof. It remains to recover the immersion, assuming (10.4) holds. The bundle V \u2295 V \u22a5 has\na metric of signature (n + 1, 1)-given by the sum of the metrics on the summands-for\nwhich \u039b is null, and the connection DhV +QV +N V on V \u2295V \u22a5 is a metric connection, which\nis flat by (10.4). Thus, locally, we have a parallel metric isomorphism V \u2295V \u22a5 \u223c\n= \u03a3 \u00d7Rn+1,1 ,\nunique up to constant gauge transformations, and the inclusion \u039b \u2192 V\u03a3 \u2295 V\u03a3\u22a5 induces a\nmap \u03c6 : \u03a3 \u2192 P(L); x 7\u2192 \u039bx \u2282 Rn+1,1 . The Cartan condition on D\u03a3 ensures that \u03c6 is an\nimmersion and N V |\u039b = 0 ensures that (the image in \u03a3 \u00d7 Rn+1,1 of) V is an enveloped\n1\ntr IIV = H V .\n\u0003\nsphere congruence, with mean curvature m\nThe above theorem is very general, but depends on a choice of enveloped sphere congruence and so it is not truly conformal: as we shall see in \u00a713.2, it includes, as a special\ncase, the Bonnet theorem for submanifolds of spaceforms. However, if we set H V = 0\nso that V = V\u03a3 is the central sphere congruence, then (10.4) reduces to (10.2) and this\nspecialization of Theorem 10.2 is purely conformal. In the next paragraph, though, we see\nthat such a formulation of the conformal Bonnet Theorem is not optimal.\n10.4. The abstract homological conformal Bonnet theorem. The normalization\nconditions used to fix the M\u00f6bius reduction and M\u00f6bius structure on \u03a3 have the homologi\u03a3\ncal interpretation that N and RD are cycles, in Z1 (\u03a3, m) and Z2 (\u03a3, so(V\u03a3 )) respectively.\nWe now show that the Gauss\u2013Codazzi\u2013Ricci equations also have a homological description,\nin terms of Bernstein\u2013Gelfand\u2013Gelfand (BGG) operators associated to the representations\nh = so(V\u03a3 ) \u2295 so(V\u03a3\u22a5 ) and m of SO(V\u03a3 ), where V\u03a3\u22a5 carries the trivial representation.\nBGG sequences of invariant linear differential operators were first introduced on curved\ngeometries by Eastwood\u2013Rice [41], for 4-dimensional conformal geometry, and by Baston [4]\nand \u010cap\u2013Slovak\u2013Sou\u010dek [35] in more general contexts. These constructions were simplified\nand extended to invariant multilinear differential operators in [25]. We need this generality\nhere, and in particular, we need the operators \u0003 h = \u2202 \u25e6 d h + d h \u25e6 \u2202 and \u03a0 = id \u2212 \u0003 \u22121\nh \u25e6\u2202 \u25e6\n\u25e6\n\u2202\nof\n\u00a74A,\nbut\nhere\ncoupled\nto\nthe\nnormal\nconnection\n\u2207\n(if\nrequired).\nd h \u2212 d h \u25e6 \u0003 \u22121\nh\nUsing this, we can define linear and bilinear BGG operators between sections of Lie\nalgebra homology bundles, closely related to the differential lift j h . We shall only need\nthem on H1 (T \u2217\u03a3, m), where, for sections [\u03b1] and [\u03b2], we have\ndBGG [\u03b1] = [\u03a0d h \u03a0\u03b1],\n\n[\u03b1] \u2294 [\u03b2] = [\u03a0([\u03a0\u03b1 \u2227 \u03a0\u03b2])],\n\nwhich are sections of H2 (T \u2217\u03a3, m) and H2 (T \u2217\u03a3, h) respectively.\nWe now have all the ingredients to establish our homological formulation of the Gauss\u2013\nCodazzi\u2013Ricci equations. These equations are simpler than the full equations since they\n\u03a3\nonly involve the homological objects [N ] and [Rh ] = [RD ] + R\u2207 . The Bernstein\u2013Gelfand\u2013\nGelfand operators provides a conceptually elegant formulation of these equations, and the\nassociated homological machinery yields a remarkably efficient proof.\n\n\fCONFORMAL SUBMANIFOLD GEOMETRY I\u2013III\n\n41\n\nTheorem 10.3. Let (V\u03a3 , \u039b, D\u03a3 ) be a normal conformal Cartan geometry on \u03a3, let (V\u03a3\u22a5 , \u2207)\nbe a euclidean vector bundle with metric connection, let N be a m-valued 1-form in ker \u2202,\nand let Q be a T \u2217\u03a3-valued 1-form in im \u2202.\nThen the data (Dh , N , Q) satisfy the full Gauss\u2013Codazzi\u2013Ricci equations (10.2) if and\nonly if N = j h [N ], Q = \u2212 12 \u0003 \u22121\nh \u2202[N \u2227 N ], and the following homological Gauss\u2013Codazzi\u2013\nRicci equations hold:\n(10.5a)\n\n0 = [Rh ] + 21 [N ] \u2294 [N ]\n\n(10.5b)\n\n0 = dBGG [N ].\n\nProof. We first observe that \u2202Rh = 0 and d h Rh = 0, so that Rh = j h [Rh ]. By Proposition 10.1, we also know that (10.2) imply that N = j h [N ] and Q = \u2212 12 \u0003 \u22121\nh \u2202[N \u2227 N ].\nIt remains to show that under these conditions, the equations (10.2) are equivalent\nto (10.5). By the uniqueness of the canonical differential representative, the latter are\nequivalent to\n0 = Rh + 21 \u03a02 [N \u2227 N ] = Rh + 12 \u03a0[N \u2227 N ]\n\nh\n= Rh + 21 [N \u2227 N ] + d h Q \u2212 12 \u0003 \u22121\nh \u2202d [N \u2227 N ]\n\nh\n0 = \u03a0d h N = d h N \u2212 \u0003 \u22121\nh \u2202[R \u2227 N ].\n\nHere we have expanded the definition of \u03a0: for the first equation we have used the fact\n\u22121\nh\nh\nh 2\nh\n\u0003\u22121\nthat \u03a0d h Q = d h Q \u2212 d h\u0003 \u22121\nh \u2202[R \u2227 Q] = 0, since [R \u2227 Q] has\nh \u2202d Q \u2212 \u0003 h \u2202(d ) Q = \u2212\u0003\nvalues in T \u2217\u03a3, hence is in the kernel of \u2202. Now the second equation implies that d hN has\nh\nvalues in V\u03a3\u22a5 \u2297 \u039b and hence \u0003 \u22121\nh \u2202d [N \u2227 N ] = 0. By substitution of the first equation into\nthe second, the equations (10.5) are therefore equivalent to\n0 = Rh + d h Q + 12 [N \u2227 N ]\n\nh\n0 = d hN + \u0003 \u22121\nh \u2202[d Q \u2227 N ],\n\nsince [N \u2227 [N \u2227 N ]] = 0 by the Jacobi identity. Now note that [Q \u2227 d h N ] = 0 since the Lie\nh\nbracket of T \u2217\u03a3 with V\u03a3\u22a5 \u2297 \u039b is trivial. Hence the last term is equal to \u0003 \u22121\nh \u2202d [Q \u2227 N ].\nWe noted in the proof of Proposition 10.1 that [Q \u2227 N ] is in the kernel of \u2202. The\nequivalence of the full and homological Gauss\u2013Codazzi\u2013Ricci equations now rests on the\nfact that it is actually in the image of \u2202. For m > 3 this follows easily from the fact\nthat [Q \u2227 N ] is a 2-form with values in V\u03a3\u22a5 \u039b, since \u2202 : \u22273 T \u2217\u03a3 \u2297 \u039b\u22a5 \u2192 \u22272 T \u2217\u03a3 \u2297 \u039b is\nthen surjective. The result is vacuous for m = 1, so it remains to prove that for m = 2,\n[Q \u2227 N ] = 0. For this, it suffices to show that (Q \u2227 N )X,Y \u03bd = 0 for any normal \u03bd and vector\nfields X, Y . Now Q vanishes on \u039b, so this reduces immediately to QX (S0Y \u03bd) \u2212 QY (S0X \u03bd),\nwhich vanishes because (for m = 2) Q \u2208 im \u2202 is tracelike and S0 is symmetric.\n\u0003\nRemark 10.4. The subtle point in the above proof was the fact that [Q \u2227 N ] \u2208 im \u2202. If\nthis had not worked out, the homology class would be h[N ], [N ], [N ]i, where h*, *, *i is one\nof the trilinear differential operators defined in [25]. It is thus a homological fluke that the\nGauss\u2013Codazzi\u2013Ricci equations are quadratic in II0 and S0 . In more general circumstances,\none should anticipate the appearance of multilinear differential operators of higher degree.\nAlthough elegant, this theorem is quite abstract at the present, and we have already\nsuggested that the Reader who prefers direct calculations to abstract machinery should\nturn to the next section, where we make the above equations and computations more\nexplicit. For this reason, we postpone the statement of the homological conformal Bonnet\ntheorem until we have understood the homological Gauss\u2013Codazzi\u2013Ricci equations more\nexplicitly. However, for the Reader with no taste for the nitty-gritty, we note that the\n\n\f42\n\nFRANCIS E. BURSTALL AND DAVID M. J.

Weyl structures and the conformal Bonnet theorem\nWe have seen that Weyl derivatives and the associated apparatus of Weyl structures and\nconnections provide an efficient computational tool in conformal geometry. The same is\ntrue in conformal submanifold geometry.\n11.1. Decomposition with respect to a Weyl structure. Let \u03a3 be an immersed\nsubmanifold of M . A M\u00f6bius reduction V provides a decomposition so(VM ) = hV \u2295mV over\n\u03a3 (9.1). On the other hand, a choice of Weyl structure on M may be restricted (pulled back)\nto \u03a3 to give a decomposition VM \u223c\n= \u039b\u2295 UM \u2295 \u039b\u0302, and hence so(VM ) \u223c\n= T \u2217M \u2295 co(T M )\u2295 T M\n(\u00a73A). (Here, as before, we omit pullbacks to \u03a3.)\nIf these data are compatible (i.e., \u039b\u0302 \u2282 V ) then V \u223c\n= \u039b \u2295 U \u2295 \u039b\u0302 with UM = U \u2295 V \u22a5 , so\nthat\n(11.1)\n\nhV\nT \u2217\u03a3 \u2295 h0 \u2295 T \u03a3\n\u223c\n\u2295\nso(VM ) = \u2295 \u223c\n=\n= T \u2217M \u2295 co(T M ) \u2295 T M,\n\u2217\nmV\nN \u03a3 \u2295 m0 \u2295 N \u03a3\n\nwhere h0 = so(T \u03a3) \u2295 so(N \u03a3) \u2295 R id T M \u2282 co(T M ) and m0 = co(T M ) \u2229 Hom(T \u03a3, N \u03a3) \u2295\n\u0001\nHom(N \u03a3, T \u03a3) . In the top line, hV = so(V ) \u2295 so(V \u22a5 ), and the isomorphism identifies\nh0 with co(T \u03a3) \u2295 so(V \u22a5 ), and so(V ) with T \u2217\u03a3 \u2295 co(T \u03a3) \u2295 T \u03a3. In the bottom line,\nN \u2217\u03a3 (\u223c\n= V \u22a5 \u039b), m0 and N \u03a3 are identified with the intersections of mV with Hom(\u039b, V \u22a5 ) \u2295\nHom(V \u22a5 , \u039b\u0302), Hom(U, V \u22a5 ) \u2295 Hom(V \u22a5 , U ) and Hom(\u039b\u0302, V \u22a5 ) \u2295 Hom(V \u22a5 , \u039b) respectively.\nFor the M\u00f6bius reduction V , (9.12) gives\nD M = D h V + QV + N V ,\nwhere DhV = D\u03a3,V + \u2207V and D\u03a3,V is a normal conformal Cartan connection on V . We\nnow apply (11.1) in two ways.\nFirst, \u039b\u0302 \u2282 VM is the restriction (pullback) to \u03a3 of a Weyl structure on M , and so\nM\nM\nDM = r D + D M \u2212 id, where the normalized Ricci tensor r D and the identity map id\n\u2217\nare viewed, by restriction, as 1-forms on \u03a3 with values in T M and T M respectively.\nSecond, \u039b\u0302 \u2282 V is a Weyl structure on \u03a3, so D\u03a3,V = r D,\u03a3 + D V \u2212 id, where D is\nthe corresponding Weyl derivative, r D,\u03a3 is the normalized Ricci curvature of the induced\nconformal M\u00f6bius structure, D V is the induced conformal connection, and id = id T \u03a3 .\nPutting these together using (11.1), we have\n\uf8f1\nM\n+\nDM\n\u2212 id = (DhV + QV ) + N V\nDM\n=\nrD\n\uf8f2\nV\nD,\u03a3\nV\nV\nV\nh\n(11.2)\n= r\n+Q\n+ D +\u2207\n\u2212 id\nD V +Q\n\uf8f3\nV\nV\nD,V\nV\nN\n=\nA\n+ II \u2212 S ,\n\nwhere we note that the m0 -component of N V is given by the second fundamental form and\nM\nshape operator of V . Comparing coefficients, we deduce that r D = (r D,\u03a3 + QV ) + AD,V\nand D M = (D V + \u2207V ) + (IIV \u2212 SV ).

On the other hand, RD \u2212 [[id \u2227 r D,\u03a3 ]] = W \u03a3 ,\n\u03a3\nthe Weyl curvature of M\u03a3 , and d D r D,\u03a3 = C \u03a3,D := C M ,D , the Cotton\u2013York curvature of\nM\u03a3 with respect to D.\nUsing this, and expanding the algebraic brackets, we can rewrite (11.3) as follows. First,\nin (11.3a) and (11.3d), the algebraic brackets are simply contractions. Second, in (11.3b),\nthe algebraic bracket is just the commutator, while in (11.3e) we have\n[[id \u2227 AD,V ]] * Z = (AD,V )\u266f \u2227 c(Z, *),\n\n[[id \u2227 AD,V ]] * U = id \u2227 AD,V (U )\n\nfor tangent vectors Z and normal vectors U .

BURSTALL AND DAVID M. J. CALDERBANK\n\n11.3. M\u00f6bius reductions, ambient Weyl structures and riemannian metrics. We\nnow discuss the relationship between M\u00f6bius reductions and Weyl structures on M , and\nhence describe the conformal geometry of submanifolds in the more familiar context of\nsubmanifolds in riemannian geometry.\nFor this, recall from section 3 that a Weyl derivative on M is a covariant derivative on\nL or \u039b = L\u22121 ; using DM and the induced conformal metric, this datum is equivalently a\ntorsion-free conformal connection on T M or a null line subbundle \u039b\u0302 \u2282 VM complementary\nto \u039b\u22a5 . This last definition makes sense along a submanifold \u03a3, i.e., we define an ambient\nWeyl structure along \u03a3 to be such a complement \u039b\u0302 in VM |\u03a3 . Thus any ambient Weyl\nstructure is the restriction to \u03a3 of some Weyl structure on M .\nAn ambient Weyl structure \u039b\u0302 along \u03a3 determines a M\u00f6bius reduction V = \u039b(1) \u2295 \u039b\u0302,\ntogether with a Weyl structure \u039b\u0302 \u2282 V for the conformal Cartan geometry (V, \u039b, DV ), or\nequivalently, a Weyl derivative D on \u03a3. The map sending \u039b\u0302 to the pair (V, D) is an affine\nbijection. Indeed, since ambient Weyl structures are equivalently complements (\u039b\u2295 \u039b\u0302)\u22a5 \u2229V\nto \u039b in \u039b\u22a5 (along \u03a3), they form an affine space modelled on C\u221e (\u03a3, Hom(\u039b\u22a5 /\u039b, \u039b)) \u223c\n=\n\u221e\n\u2217\nC (\u03a3, T M ): \u039b\u0302 + \u03b3 = exp(\u2212\u03b3) * \u039b\u0302 and one readily checks that this affine structure is\ninduced by the natural affine structure (V, D) + \u03b3 = (V + \u03b3\u22a5 , D + \u03b3\u22a4 ).\nRemark 11.1. An ambient Weyl structure can be regarded as an operator\nVM \u2192 T \u2217M L = T \u2217\u03a3 L \u2295 N \u2217\u03a3 L\nvanishing on \u039b, whose restriction to \u039b\u22a5 /\u039b is the soldering isomorphism. Identifying VM mod\n\u039b with the restriction to \u03a3 of J 1 L on M , such operators arise as restrictions to \u03a3 of the jet\nbundle map induced by a Weyl derivative on M . The T \u2217\u03a3 L component of this operator\ngives the jet bundle map J 1 L \u2192 T \u2217\u03a3 L induced by the induced Weyl derivative on \u03a3, while\nthe N \u2217\u03a3L component is the operator PV : VM \u2192 N \u2217\u03a3L with PV (v) = \u03c0(v\u22a5 ) induced by the\nM\u00f6bius reduction V . This provides another way to see the affine bijection between ambient\nWeyl structures and pairs (D, V )-furthermore, since D V is the pullback to \u03a3 of a Weyl\n\u22a5\nconnection on M , it transforms as a Weyl connection should: (D + \u03b3\u22a4 )V +\u03b3 = D V + [[*, \u03b3]].\nAs a special case of this, the canonical M\u00f6bius reduction may be described by a natural\ndifferential operator, just like the canonical M\u00f6bius structure (Hc , Sc ), cf. Remark 4.4.\nIndeed, a positive section l of LM on a neighbourhood of \u03a3 in M provides a metric with\nrespect to which we can compute the mean curvature covector H l of \u03a3 in M . Now if D is the\nWeyl derivative and Levi-Civita connection of the metric l2 c, then PV\u03a3 = PD +H D p, where\nPD defines the M\u00f6bius reduction associated to D. Since (PD mod \u039b)(j 1 l) = (Dl)|\u03a3\u22a5 = 0\nand H D = H l , we have (PV\u03a3 mod \u039b)(j 1 l) = H l l.\nIf D M is a Weyl connection on (a neighbourhood of \u03a3 in) M , it induces an ambient\nWeyl structure along \u03a3, hence a M\u00f6bius reduction V and a Weyl structure on \u03a3, and any\nM\u00f6bius reduction and Weyl structure arise in this way. Further, the second fundamental\nM Y )\u22a5 \u2208 N \u03a3.\nform is given by the familiar expression IIVX Y = (DX\nIn particular, let g be a compatible riemannian metric on (a neighbourhood of \u03a3) in M .\nThen, using the Levi-Civita connection of g, we obtain:\n\u2022 a M\u00f6bius reduction Vg along \u03a3 with H Vg = H g , i.e., IIVg = IIg , where IIg and H g are the\nusual riemannian second fundamental form and mean curvature covector respectively;\n\u2022 a Weyl structure \u039b\u0302g \u2282 Vg on \u03a3 corresponding to the Levi-Civita connection D of the\ninduced metric on \u03a3.\nThe other quantities associated with this reduction and Weyl structure are:\n(11.9)\n\nr D,Vg = (r g )\u22a4 ,\n\nAD,Vg = (r g )\u22a5 ,\n\n\fCONFORMAL SUBMANIFOLD GEOMETRY I\u2013III\n\n45\n\ni.e., the components of the ambient normalized Ricci curvature r g after the latter is pulled\nback to give a T \u2217M -valued 1-form on \u03a3. (See \u00a711.1.)\nAccording to \u00a79.3, we can then compare Vg with the canonical M\u00f6bius reduction V\u03a3 by\nwriting V\u03a3 = Vg + H g , and hence relate the riemannian and conformal quantities. We have\n(11.10)\n\nII0 = IIg \u2212 (H g )\u266f \u2297 g,\n\nS0 = Sg \u2212 id \u2297 H g\n\nand the pullback D g of the Levi-Civita connection of M to \u03a3 is related to the intrinsic\nLevi-Civita connection D by\n(11.11)\n\nD g = D + (IIg \u2212 Sg ) + \u2207D = D V\u03a3 + [[*, H g ]],\n\nwhere \u2207D is the induced connection on N \u03a3 and D V\u03a3 = D+(II0 \u2212S0 )+\u2207D is the connection\non T M |\u03a3 induced by D and the canonical M\u00f6bius reduction V\u03a3 . We also have\n(11.12)\n(11.13)\n\nr D,\u03a3 = (r g )\u22a4 \u2212 Qg\n\nAD := AD,V\u03a3 = (r g )\u22a5 \u2212 \u2207D H g ,\n\nwhere Qg = Q \u2212 H g (II0 ) \u2212 12 hH g , H g ic. Substituting into (11.4)\u2013(11.8), with V = V\u03a3 , the\nconformally invariant equations (11.4), (11.6) and (11.8) can be viewed as trace-free parts\nof the riemannian Gauss\u2013Codazzi\u2013Ricci equations.\nWhen g is an Einstein metric, (r g )\u22a4 is a multiple of c and (r g )\u22a5 = 0. As we have seen in\n\u00a77.2, such metrics arise when M = S n , and we shall discuss this further in \u00a713.2 and \u00a713.3.\nWe emphasise that M\u00f6bius reductions (or Weyl structures) do not all arise from from\nambient metrics.\n11.4.

We now specialize\nonce more to immersions of \u03a3 into the conformal n-sphere M = S n , when VM = \u03a3 \u00d7Rn+1,1\nand DM is flat differentiation d. Our goal is to illuminate the abstract aspect of the\nhomological conformal Bonnet theorem by describing the homological Gauss\u2013Codazzi\u2013Ricci\nequations in a more explicit way. We shall see that there really are fewer homological than\nfull Gauss\u2013Codazzi\u2013Ricci equations: although the Ricci equation is unaffected, the Gauss\nand Codazzi equations simplify. We also indicate how to show this by direct computation.\nTo this end, we let V = V\u03a3 be the central sphere congruence and introduce an arbitrary\ncompatible Weyl structure V\u03a3 = \u039b \u2295 \u039b T \u03a3 \u2295 \u039b\u0302 (with induced Weyl derivative D)\n\n\fCONFORMAL SUBMANIFOLD GEOMETRY I\u2013III\n\n47\n\nThe Gauss\u2013Codazzi\u2013Ricci equations (10.4), with DM = d and V = V\u03a3 (hence H V = 0)\nspecialize to the following:\n(11.21a)\n(11.21b)\n(11.21c)\n(11.21d)\n(11.21e)\n\n0 = W \u03a3 \u2212 [[id \u2227 Q]] \u2212 S0 \u2227 II0\n\n0 = C \u03a3,D + d D Q + AD \u2227 II0\n\n0 = d \u2207,D II0 \u2212 (AD )\u266f \u2227 c,\nD\n\n0 = d \u2207,D S0 + id \u2227 AD ;\n\n0 = d \u2207 AD \u2212 (r D,\u03a3 + Q) \u2227 S0\n\n0 = R\u2207 \u2212 II0 \u2227 S0 .\n\nNow the homological formulation shows that of the first four equations, only two are relevant\nin each dimension.\n\u2022 If m = 2, there are no Weyl tensors or Codazzi tensors on \u03a3: (11.21a) and (11.21c) are\ntrivial, while (11.21b) and (11.21d) are independent of D.\n\u2022 If m = 3, there are still no Weyl tensors on \u03a3: (11.21a) is trivial, while (11.21d) is an\nautomatic consequence of the others, which are independent of D,\n\u2022 If m > 4, (11.21b) and (11.21d) follow from the others, which are independent of D.\nIt is possible to check these facts directly, without recourse to the general theory of [25]\nused above: it is straightforward that (11.21a) and (11.21c) are trivial in low dimensions,\nbut rather more difficult to check (by differentiating) that (11.21b) and (11.21d) are consequences of these in higher dimensions. In fact these relations follow easily from the theory\nof the differential lift [25]: one must check that the right hand sides of the above equations\nsatisfy d D (11.21a) = [[id \u2227 (11.21b)]] and d D,\u2207 (11.21c) = [[id \u2227 (11.21d)]].\nInstead of doing this, we shall instead concentrate on the fact that the relevant equations\nin each dimension are M\u00f6bius-invariant, i.e., independent of D. This is clear for the Ricci\nequation (11.21e) and for (11.21a) (which is only relevant when m > 4). We now look at\nthe other equations, and describe explicitly the M\u00f6bius-invariant operators involved.\nWe first note that (11.21c) (which is only relevant when m > 3) may be rewritten\nCCoda\u2207 S0 = 0,\nwhere CCoda is the conformal Codazzi operator\n1\nid \u2227 (div D S)\u266d\n(11.22)\nCCoda S = d D S +\nm\u22121\non symmetric tracefree endomorphisms S of weight \u22121. It is easy to check that CCoda\nis a conformally-invariant first order differential operator (see [44] for the general theory),\nwhich is identically zero for m = 2. Coupling to the connection \u2207 on LN \u2217\u03a3 gives CCoda\u2207 .\nWe next consider (11.21d) when m = 2. Applying the Hodge star operator, we have\ndiv D,\u2207 div D,\u2207 JII0 + hJII0 , r0D,\u03a3 i = 0,\n\nwhere we have used the fact that only the symmetric tracefree part r0D,\u03a3 of r D,\u03a3 + Q can\ncontribute to the second term, and the definition h(JII0 )X , \u03bei = \u2217hII0X , \u03bei of the complex\nstructure on S02 T \u2217\u03a3 \u2297 N \u03a3. We can rewrite this as\n(H\u2207 )\u2217 (JII0 ) = 0,\n\nwhere (H\u2207 )\u2217 is the formal adjoint of the M\u00f6bius structure coupled to \u2207, i.e., H\u2207 \u03bd =\nsym0 (D \u2207 )2 \u03bd + r0D,\u03a3 \u03bd. This is a M\u00f6bius-invariant second order differential operator.\nFinally we must consider (11.21b) when m = 2 or 3.

Again one can check (by differentiating with respect\nto D) that B is conformally-invariant for m = 2, 3.

Submanifold geometry in the conformal sphere\n12.1. Projective geometry of curves. In this section we briefly review the geometry\nof curves in M = S n . In this case the primitive data on the curve is a projective structure\n\u2206 : J 2 L1/2 \u2192 L\u22123/2 (equivalently given by the bilinear operator M\u03a3 ), metric connection\n\u2207 on a metric vector bundle N \u03a3\u039b of rank n \u2212 1, and the conformal acceleration A, a\nN \u2217\u03a3-valued 1-form. Any such data give rise to a local conformal immersion of \u03a3, unique\nup to M\u00f6bius transformation. The M\u00f6bius invariants of \u03a3 can be computed in terms of\nan ambient Weyl connection D M . This induces an intrinsic Weyl structure D with respect\nM\nto which \u2206 = D 2 + 12 s D,\u03a3 , where s D,\u03a3 = r D (T, T ) + 12 |H|2 for a weightless unit tangent\nvector T and (mean) curvature vector H = DTM T .

Surfaces, the conformal Bonnet theorem, and quaternions. Let \u03a3 be a\nsurface in S n . Then the Hodge star operator on \u03a91 (\u03a3, T \u2217\u03a3) restricts to give a complex\nstructure on S02 T \u2217\u03a3. As we have noted already, this identifies S02 T \u2217\u03a3 with the bundle\n\u03a92,0 \u03a3 of quadratic differentials. More precisely the \u00b1i eigenspace decomposition of this\ncomplex structure may be written S02 T \u2217\u03a3 \u2297 C \u223c\n= \u03a92,0 \u03a3 \u2295 \u03a90,2 \u03a3, where \u03a92,0 \u03a3 = (T 1,0 \u03a3)\u22122 ,\n0,2\n0,1\n\u22122\n1,0\n\u03a9 \u03a3 = (T \u03a3) , and T \u03a3 \u2297 C = T \u03a3 \u2295 T 0,1 \u03a3 is the \u00b1i eigenspace decomposition\nof the complex structure on the tangent bundle into the two null lines of the complexified\nconformal metric. The isomorphism S02 T \u2217M \u2192 \u03a92,0 \u03a3 is the projection q 7\u2192 q 2,0 with\nrespect to this decomposition.\nWe now note that the exterior derivative d D : \u03a91 (\u03a3, T \u2217\u03a3) \u2192 \u03a92 (\u03a3, T \u2217\u03a3) coupled to\na Weyl connection D restricts to give the holomorphic structure on S02 T \u2217\u03a3: (d D q)2,1 =\n\u2202(q 2,0 ) \u2208 \u03a91,1 (\u03a3, (T 1,0 \u03a3)\u2217 ). Since this is independent of the choice of Weyl structure, we\ndenote d D q by dq. Similarly, (dq)1,2 = \u2202(q 0,2 ). We therefore have\ndq = \u2202(q 2,0 ) + \u2202(q 0,2 )\ndiv q = \u2217(\u2202(q 2,0 ) \u2212 \u2202(q 0,2 )),\n\nthe second line being obtained from the first via d\u2217q = \u2217div q, showing that the divergence\nis also a conformally invariant operator on quadratic differentials. Thus dq = 0 iff div q = 0\niff \u2202(q 2,0 ) = 0 iff \u2202(q 0,2 ) = 0, in which case we say q is holomorphic quadratic differential.\nApplying similar ideas to the M\u00f6bius differential N yields the following fact.\nProposition 12.1. Let \u039b be an immersion of a surface \u03a3 in S n whose central sphere\ncongruence V\u03a3 has M\u00f6bius differential N . Then \u2202\u2217N = 0 and \u2217N is the differential\nrepresentative of its homology class JII0 \u2212 JS0 .\n\nProof. The fact that \u2202\u2217N = 0 follows easily from the symmetry of the second fundamental\nform (or shape operator). To show \u2217N is the differential representative, we need to show\nthat \u2202d h \u2217N = 0, i.e., d h \u2217N |V \u22a5 \u2208 \u03a92 (\u03a3, Hom(V\u03a3\u22a5 , \u039b)). For this we write \u039b(1) \u2297C = \u039b(1,0) +\n\u03a3\n\u039b(0,1) , where \u039b(1,0) \u2229 \u039b(0,1) = \u039b\u2297 C, \u039b(1,0) /(\u039b\u2297 C) \u223c\n= \u039bT 1,0 \u03a3 and \u039b(0,1) /(\u039b\u2297 C) \u223c\n= \u039bT 0,1 \u03a3.\n1,0\n0,1\n1,0\n0,1\nNow N = N + N\nand \u2217N = i(N \u2212 N ), where\nN 1,0 |V \u22a5 \u2208 \u03a91,0 (\u03a3, Hom(V\u03a3\u22a5 , \u039b(1,0) )),\n\u03a3\n\nN 0,1 |V \u22a5 \u2208 \u03a90,1 (\u03a3, Hom(V\u03a3\u22a5 , \u039b(0,1) )).\n\u03a3\n\nSince the (1, 0) and (0, 1) directions are null, D1,0 \u039b(1,0) \u2282 \u039b(1,0) and D0,1 \u039b(0,1) \u2282 \u039b(0,1) . It\nfollows that\nd h (N 1,0 )|V \u22a5 \u2208 \u03a91,1 (\u03a3, Hom(V\u03a3\u22a5 , \u039b(1,0) )),\n\u03a3\n\nNow\n\nd h N |V \u22a5\n\u03a3\n\nd h \u2217N |V \u22a5 .\n\ntakes values in\n\nHom(V\u03a3\u22a5 , \u039b),\n\nd h (N 0,1 )|V \u22a5 \u2208 \u03a91,1 (\u03a3, Hom(V\u03a3\u22a5 , \u039b(0,1) )).\n\u03a3\n\nhence so do d h (N 1,0 )|V \u22a5 , d h (N 0,1 )|V \u22a5 and\n\u03a3\n\n\u03a3\n\n\u0003\n\n\u03a3\n\nThere is a conceptual explanation for the above result: in complexified conformal geometry (or in signature (1, 1)), II0 does not lie in an irreducible homology bundle and its\ndifferential lift is the sum of the differential lifts of the two irreducible components.\nThere is another fact we shall need: note that if \u03b7 \u2208 \u03a91 (\u03a3, T \u2217M ) then \u2202\u03b7 = 0 and [\u03b7] is\na quadratic differential q given by the trace-free symmetric tangential part of \u03b7.\nProposition 12.2. Suppose [\u03b7] = q and and \u2202d h \u03b7 = 0. Then \u03b7 = q (i.e., \u03b7 is trace-free,\nsymmetric and tangential), d h\u03b7 = 0 if and only if q is holomorphic (i.e., dq = 0), and\n[N \u2227 \u03b7] = 0 if and only if q commutes with the shape operators (i.e., q \u2227 S0 = 0).\n\nProof. If 0 = \u2202d h \u03b7 = \u2202[[id \u2227 \u03b7]] then by adjointness 0 = [[id \u2227 \u03b7]], from which it easily follows\nthat \u03b7 is tangential and trace-free symmetric. Then d h \u03b7 = 0 if and only if d D \u03b7 = 0 for\nsome (hence any) Weyl derivative d, i.e., q is holomorphic. The last part is immediate. \u0003\n\n\f50\n\nFRANCIS E. BURSTALL AND DAVID M. J.

Surfaces are conformally flat, i.e.,\nlocally, we can introduce a holomorphic coordinate z = x + iy, so that (x, y) are conformal\n(aka. isothermal) coordinates. Hence we can refer everything to the flat M\u00f6bius structure\nMz determined by z and, in this setting, the Gauss\u2013Codazzi\u2013Ricci equations have a very\nn\ndown-to-earth flavour. Recall that the flat connection d = DS on \u03a3 \u00d7 Rn+1,1 may be\nwritten d = D\u03a3 + Q + \u2207 + N with Q pure trace so that, for \u03c3 a section of \u039b,\n\u03a3\n\u03a3 \u03a3\n\u2202z2 \u03c3 = (D\u03a3 + Q)\u2202z (D\u03a3 + Q)\u2202z \u03c3 + N\u2202z (D\u03a3\n\u2202z \u03c3) = D\u2202z D\u2202z \u03c3 + N\u2202z (D\u2202z \u03c3).\n\nFix \u03c3 by demanding that (d\u03c3, d\u03c3) = dz d z\u0304 so that \u03c3 is parallel for the (flat) Weyl derivative\nD z .

Define \u03ba, a section of V\u03a3\u22a5 by \u03ba = \u2212II0 (\u2202z , \u2202z )\u03c3 so that\n\u2202z2 \u03c3 + q\u03c3 = \u03ba.\n\nThe remaining ingredients of the Gauss\u2013Codazzi\u2013Ricci equations are now readily expressed\nin terms of q, \u03ba, \u2207:\nQ(\u2202z , \u2202z ) = (\u03ba, \u03ba\u0304)\n\nand\n\nz\n\nAD = 2(\u2207\u2202z \u03ba)\u03c3.\n\nAn easy computation then gives the following form of the Gauss\u2013Codazzi\u2013Ricci equations:\n\u2202z\u0304 q = 3(\u2207\u2202z \u03ba\u0304, \u03ba) + (\u03ba\u0304, \u2207\u2202z \u03ba)\nIm(\u2207\u2202z\u0304 \u2207\u2202z\u0304 \u03ba + q\u0304\u03ba) = 0\n\nR\u2202\u2207z\u0304 ,\u2202z \u03be = 2(\u03ba, \u03be)\u03ba\u0304 \u2212 2(\u03ba\u0304, \u03be)\u03ba.\n\nThis formulation of the Gauss\u2013Codazzi\u2013Ricci equations and the Bonnet theorem was developed in [21] using a bare-hands approach.\nSurfaces in the 4-sphere and quaternions. For surfaces in S 4 , \u00a76.4 reveals an alternative\napproach to submanifold geometry, using the spin representation of Spin(5, 1) \u223c\n= SL(2, H)\nand quaternions. This is the setting for the book [18], in which quaternionic holomorphic\nstructures are used to study the global theory of conformal immersions. We shall content\nourselves here with a consideration of the local invariants from a quaternionic point of view.\nLet \u039bH \u2282 H := \u03a3 \u00d7 H2 be an immersion of a surface \u03a3 into S 4 \u223c\n= HP 1 . The differential\n4\n\u223c\nof this immersion is \u03b2 : T \u03a3 \u2192 HomH (\u039bH , H/\u039bH ) = T S |\u03a3 . It follows that there are unique\nquaternion linear complex structures on \u039bH and H/\u039bH up to sign which preserve, and agree\non, the image of \u03b2 (geometrically, they act by selfdual and antiselfdual rotations on T S 4 ).\nWe denote these complex structures by J: in symbols \u2217\u03b2 = J \u25e6 \u03b2 = \u03b2 \u25e6 J, where \u2217 is the\nHodge star operator of the induced conformal metric on \u03a3. The normal bundle of \u03a3 then\nconsists of the elements of HomH (\u039bH , H/\u039bH ) which anticommute with J, and we equip it\nwith the complex structure given by precomposition with J.\nAn enveloped sphere congruence in this language is a complex structure JV on H which\npreserves \u039bH and induces J on \u039bH and H/\u039bH . Flat differentiation then splits as d =\nDV + N V , where DV JV = 0 and N V anticommutes with JV . The enveloping condition\nmeans equivalently that N V preserves \u039bH . The second fundamental form IIV arises from\nthe induced endomorphisms of \u039bH and H/\u039bH by restricting pre- and post-composition to\n\n\fCONFORMAL SUBMANIFOLD GEOMETRY I\u2013III\n\n51\n\nthe image of \u03b2, yielding 1-forms with values in Hom(T \u03a3, N \u03a3), one J-linear, the other\nJ-antilinear. The central sphere congruence condition that IIV is tracefree may then be\ninterpreted as saying that (IIV )1,0 is J-linear and (IIV )0,1 is J-antilinear (or vice versa).\nThese are the objects are referred to as A and Q in [18].\nPreview of Part IV\nIn this second part of our work, sphere congruences have been used as a tool to define\nhomological invariants which characterize conformal immersions into S n up to M\u00f6bius\ntransformation. Part III is devoted to some applications of this homological machinery to\nintegrable conformal submanifold geometries.\nSphere congruences in conformal geometry (i.e., maps from an m-manifold \u03a3 into the\ngrassmannian of k-spheres in S n ) may also be studied in their own right, and were of\nconsiderable interest classically [8, 38]. There is a rich interplay between sphere congruences\nand submanifolds: for example, sphere congruences may have enveloping submanifolds\n(which we have studied here for k = m) or orthogonal submanifolds (which are of particular\ninterest for k = n \u2212 m).\nIn Part IV of our work, we develop an approach to sphere congruences using the bundle\nformalism, in which a sphere congruence is studied as a signature (k + 1, 1) subbundle V of\nthe trivial Rn+1,1 bundle over \u03a3. This theory is essentially self-contained, since it depends\nonly on the straightforward idea to write d = DV + N V , where DV is the induced direct\nsum connection on \u03a3 \u00d7Rn+1,1 = V \u2295 V \u22a5 , and N V is the remaining, off-diagonal, part of d.\nWe have already seen, for example, that an enveloping submanifold is a null line subbundle\n\u039b of V on which N V vanishes (i.e., \u039b(1) := d\u039b \u2286 V ). Similarly, an orthogonal submanifold\nis DV -parallel null \u039b \u2286 V (so \u039b(1) \u2286 \u039b \u2295 V \u22a5 ).\nWe focus in particular on Ribaucour sphere congruences (with k = m) and spherical systems (with k = n \u2212 m-known as cyclic systems when n \u2212 m = 1). For Ribaucour sphere\ncongruences, we establish the well-known Bianchi permutability of Ribaucour transformations. Although Lie sphere geometry provides a more general setting for these [19], extra\ninformation is available in the conformal approach, leading to additional applications.\nFor spherical systems, we devote our attention to flat spherical systems (for which DV\nis a flat connection-for a general spherical system, it is only assumed to be flat on V \u22a5 ).\nThese are examples of \"curved flats\" arising in conformal geometry [45, 74]. Darboux\npairs of isothermic surfaces provide another example, in which a 2-dimensional 0-sphere\ncongruence is a curved flat [20].\nIt is well-known that curved flats admit B\u00e4cklund transformations which can be derived\nfrom a loop-group formalism, but we develop instead a direct approach. This has (at least)\ntwo advantages: first, we do not need to introduce frames; second, the definition of the\nB\u00e4cklund transformations does not involve dressing (i.e., Birkhoff factorization)-this is\nonly needed (and then only implicitly and in a very simple form) for the permutability of\nB\u00e4cklund transformations. We also introduce a theory of polynomial conserved quantities\nfor such curved flats, which has several applications.\nPart III. Applications and Examples\nWe now explore some applications of our conformal submanifold geometry theory. We\nbegin in \u00a713.1 with the simplest examples, the totally umbilic and channel submanifolds,\nand we discuss the curvature spheres which can be used to describe them. In \u00a7\u00a713.2\u201313.3 we\nstudy the interaction of submanifolds with the symmetry breaking induced by a constant\nvector or (k + 1)-plane (cf. \u00a7\u00a77.2\u20137.3) and find homological characterizations of minimal\n\n\f52\n\nFRANCIS E. BURSTALL AND DAVID M. J. CALDERBANK\n\nsubmanifolds in a spaceform and submanifolds splitting across a product decomposition.\nThen, in \u00a713.4, we give a fast analysis of orthogonal systems and Dupin's Theorem.\nWe next turn to Willmore and constrained Willmore surfaces. On any compact surface\n\u03a3 in S n , the square norm (with respect to the conformal metric and the metric on the\nweightless normal bundle), |II0 |2 , of the tracefree second fundamental form is a section of\n\u22122\nthe Willmore integrand), and so may be invariantly integrated. The integral\nRL (called\n0 2\n|II\n|\nis\ncalled\nthe Willmore functional W.\n\u03a3\nA compact Willmore surface is a critical point for W on the space of all immersions\nof a fixed compact surface \u03a3, while a compact constrained Willmore surface is a critical\npoint restricted to immersions inducing a fixed conformal structure on \u03a3. It is usual to\nextend the definition of Willmore and constrained Willmore surfaces to arbitrary surfaces\nby requiring that the Euler\u2013Lagrange equations hold, with a Lagrange multiplier (which is\na holomorphic quadratic differential) in the constrained case. We take this as our starting\npoint in \u00a714.1, where we derive the classical equation in codimension one, and obtain a\nspectral deformation in arbitrary codimension. Then, in \u00a714.2, we derive the (constrained)\nWillmore equation from the functional, using the relation with the harmonic map equation\nfor the central sphere congruence. Although this is well-known, our machinery does not\nget in the way the key idea, and reveals the homological nature of this theory.\nWe next turn to isothermic surfaces, which were of great classical interest partly because\nthey are the only surfaces which admit a deformation which does not alter the induced\nconformal metric, normal connection and tracefree second fundamental form. This is of\nparticular interest in our theory, because in this situation the induced M\u00f6bius structure\nM\u03a3 is the key invariant. We give a manifestly conformally-invariant definition in \u00a715.1,\nthen describe the deformations and associated family of flat connections. In \u00a715.2 we give\nexamples: products of curves in spaceforms, CMC and generalized H-surfaces, and quadrics\n(previously considered as 'mysterious' examples). We end with an intrinsic equation for\nisothermic surfaces in codimension one \u00a715.3.\nIn any type of submanifold geometry, it is natural to ask when the induced intrinsic\ngeometry is flat. In conformal submanifold geometry this has an unambiguous meaning for\nm > 3: the induced conformal metric should be (conformally) flat. For m = 1, flatness\nis automatic, so it remains to consider the case m = 2. Using only conformal structures,\nflatness would also be automatic, but the theory of M\u00f6bius structures provides an obvious\nnontrivial condition: flatness of the induced conformal M\u00f6bius structure or equivalently\nof the normal Cartan connection (on the central sphere congruence). However, a more\ngeneral condition turns out to be more natural: that there is some enveloped sphere congruence V inducing a flat conformal M\u00f6bius structure on \u03a3. Imposing also flatness of\nthe weightless normal bundle (which is automatic in codimension one), we thus develop,\nin section 16, a new unified theory of \"M\u00f6bius-flat submanifolds\". In dimension m > 3\nthese are the conformally-flat submanifolds, while in dimension m = 2 and codimension\none, they turn out to be the classical Guichard surfaces [23, 49]. Using this theory we show\nthat channel submanifolds and constant Gaussian curvature surfaces are M\u00f6bius-flat, as are\ncertain extrinsic products. We rederive results of Cartan and Hertrich-Jeromin[36, 54] on\nconformally-flat hypersurfaces and Guichard nets [50], and end this part by placing Dupin\ncyclides in this context.\n13.

A curvature sphere is an enveloped m-sphere congruence V such that\nIIV is degenerate (as an N \u03a3-valued bilinear form on T \u03a3). Let TV denote the subbundle of\n\n\fCONFORMAL SUBMANIFOLD GEOMETRY I\u2013III\n\n53\n\nT \u03a3 on which IIV degenerates: we assume for simplicity that its rank, called the multiplicity\nof V , is constant on \u03a3.\nCurvature spheres are a convenient way of describing the eigenspaces and eigenvalues of\nthe shape operator. Indeed if V is any enveloped sphere congruence and E is a simultaneous\neigenspace for the normal components of the shape operator SV such that SV (U ) has\neigenvalue \u03bd(U ) for all normal vectors U , then V + \u03bd is a curvature sphere with TV +\u03bd = E.\nThe existence of simultaneous eigenspaces is facilitated by the following well-known fact.\nProposition 13.2. The normal components of SV commute with each other if and only if\n\u03a3 has flat (weightless) normal bundle.\nProof. By the Ricci equation (9.3a) and the symmetry of the shape operator, we have\n\u2207\nhRX,Y\nU1 , U2 i = h(IIVX SVY \u2212 IIVY SVX )U1 , U2 i = hSVY U1 , SVX U2 i \u2212 hSVX U1 , SVY U2 i\n\n= hSVSV U2 U1 , Y i \u2212 hSVSV U1 U2 , Y i.\nX\n\nThe result follows.\n\nX\n\n\u0003\n\nRemark 13.3. Since QV (viewed as an \u039b2 -valued endomorphism) is a linear combination\nof id with normal components of S0 and II0 \u25e6 S0 , we have that QV \u2227 S0 = 0 if the normal\nbundle is flat.\nWe deduce from the proposition that if \u03a3 has flat normal bundle, then the normal\ncomponents of SV are simultaneously diagonalizable, since they are symmetric. Thus if\nV1 , . . . Vl are the curvature spheres, then T \u03a3 is the orthogonal direct sum of the TVi . The\nsubbundles TVi are the (simultaneous) eigenspaces of the shape operator, and the conormal\neigenvalues \u03bdi give the curvature spheres via Vi = V + \u03bdi .\nProposition 13.4. If a curvature sphere V has multiplicity greater than 1 then TV is an\nintegrable distribution and V is constant (i.e., a parallel subbundle of \u03a3 \u00d7 Rn+1,1 ) along\nthe leaves of the corresponding foliation.\nProof. The Codazzi equation for V implies that\n(13.1)\n\nD,V\n0 = (\u2207D IIV )X,Y \u2212 (\u2207D IIV )Y,X + AD,V\nX Y \u2212 AY X\nD,V\n= IIV[X,Y ] + AD,V\nX\nX Y \u2212 AY\n\nfor X, Y in TV . Thus IIV[X,Y ] is in TV , but it is also in TV\u22a5 by the symmetry of IIV ,\nand therefore IIV[X,Y ] = 0 and [X, Y ] is in TV . Now contracting (13.1) with Y , we get\nD,V\nD,V\nAD,V\n=0\nX hY, Y i\u2212AY hX, Y i = 0, and taking hX, Y i = 0, hY, Y i 6= 0, we deduce that AX\nfor all X in TV . Hence NXV = 0 for all X in TV , i.e., V is parallel in the TV directions. \u0003\n\nThe first conclusion of this proposition is automatic for curvature spheres of multiplicity\none, but the second is not.\nDefinitions 13.5. Let \u03a3 be a submanifold of S n of dimension m > 2 with flat normal\nbundle. Then \u03a3 is said to be:\n(i) a Dupin submanifold iff its curvature spheres are all constant along their foliations;\n(ii) a totally umbilic submanifold iff II0 = 0, i.e., it has only one curvature sphere;\n(iii) a channel submanifold iff it is the envelope of a 1-parameter family of m-spheres, i.e.,\nit admits an enveloped sphere congruence V whose derivative N V : T \u03a3 \u2192 mV has rank\none (so that V is, in particular, a curvature sphere of multiplicity m \u2212 1).\nThe following well-known observations are immediate consequences of Proposition 13.4.\n\n\f54\n\nFRANCIS E. BURSTALL AND DAVID M. J. CALDERBANK\n\nCorollary 13.6. A totally umbilic m-submanifold (m > 2) of S n is an open subset of its\ncurvature sphere (hence is a Dupin submanifold).\nCorollary 13.7. Suppose \u03a3 has flat normal bundle and exactly two curvature spheres.\nThen \u03a3 is either a surface, a channel submanifold, or a Dupin submanifold.\n13.2. Constant vectors and tangent congruences in spaceform geometries. In\n\u00a711.3 we showed how to break the conformal invariance of our theory by introducing a\ncompatible riemannian metric on M . When M is an open subset of S n = P(L), such\na metric is given by a section of the positive light-cone L+ \u2282 \u039b over M . As we have\ndiscussed in \u00a77.2, a particularly important class of such sections are the conic sections\n{\u03c3 \u2208 L+ : (v\u221e , \u03c3) = \u22121} associated to nonzero vectors v\u221e \u2208 Rn+1,1 . We have seen\nthat such a section induces a constant curvature metric g on M , with Weyl structure\n\u039b\u0302g = <v\u221e + 21 (v\u221e , v\u221e )\u03c3> in M \u00d7 Rn+1,1 (where (v\u221e , \u03c3) = \u22121).\nAlong a submanifold \u03a3 of M , \u039b\u0302g defines an ambient Weyl structure, inducing the sphere\ncongruence Vg = \u039b(1) \u2295 \u039b\u0302g = \u039b(1) \u2295 <v\u221e >. We refer to a sphere congruence containing a\nconstant vector v\u221e as the tangent congruence to \u03a3 in the spaceform given by v\u221e . When\nv\u221e is null and the geometry on M \u2286 S n r <v\u221e > is euclidean, the tangent spheres pass\nthrough the point at infinity, and so they stereoproject to tangent planes in the usual sense.\nProposition 13.8. For a sphere congruence V and Weyl structure \u039b\u0302 \u2282 V (with associated\nWeyl derivative D), the following are equivalent:\n(i) V = Vg and \u039b\u0302 = \u039b\u0302g for a conic section of L+ ;\n\n(ii) V is a tangent congruence and is enveloped by \u039b\u0302 (i.e., N |\u039b\u0302 = 0);\n(iii) r D,V = 1 sc for a section s of \u039b2 \u223c\n= Hom(\u039b\u0302, \u039b), and AD,V = 0.\nn\n\nProof. By (11.9), r D,Vg = (r g )\u22a4 = n1 s g c and AD,Vg = (r g )\u22a5 = 0. Thus (i)\u21d4(ii) and these\nimply (iii). For the converse implication, if r D,V = n1 sc and AD,V = 0, the Gauss equation\nimplies that s is D-parallel. Let \u03c3\u0302 be a D-parallel section of \u039b\u0302 and s(\u03c3\u0302) the induced section\nof \u039b; then v\u221e = \u03c3\u0302 + n1 s(\u03c3\u0302) is a constant vector.\n\u0003\nIf v\u221e is null, \u039b\u0302g is constant, so the submanifold it defines is a point, but otherwise, it is\nimmersed. The Gauss\u2013Codazzi\u2013Ricci equations in this case are equivalent to the riemannian\nGauss\u2013Codazzi\u2013Ricci equations in the corresponding spaceform geometry and the Bonnet\ntheorem reduces to the riemannian one.\nWe now consider the relation between v\u221e and V\u03a3 . Since Vg = exp(H g )V\u03a3 contains v\u221e ,\nit follows that V\u03a3 component of v\u221e is H g l, where l is dual to \u03c3. In particular\n\u03a3 is a minimal submanifold in the spaceform iff v\u221e \u2208 V\u03a3 iff V\u03a3 = Vg ,\n\ni.e., the tangent congruence and the central sphere congruence agree. We remark that in\ngeneral the homology class of v\u221e is the pair (l, H g l) in L \u2295 L N \u2217\u03a3, and so the minimal\nsubmanifolds are precisely those for which the homology class of v\u221e is tangential.\nFinally, we ask when the Weyl structure of g provides a second envelope of the central\nsphere congruence, i.e., AD = 0 for the induced Weyl derivative D: equation (11.13)\nhere reads AD = \u2212\u2207D H g , i.e., the submanifold has parallel mean curvature in the given\nspaceform geometry.\n13.3. Symmetry breaking for submanifolds. We study again the metrics considered\nin \u00a77.3, associated to a (k + 1)-plane W in Rn+1,1 , with orthogonal (n \u2212 k + 1)-plane W \u22a5 ,\nwhere 0 6 k 6 n, which identify an open subset of S n with a product of spaceforms of\ndimension k and n \u2212 k. For an m-dimensional submanifold \u039b \u2192 \u03a3 of this open subset, let\n\n\fCONFORMAL SUBMANIFOLD GEOMETRY I\u2013III\n\n55\n\n\u039b\u0302 be the ambient Weyl structure along \u03a3 with \u039b \u2295 \u039b\u0302 = (\u03a3 \u00d7 W \u2295 \u039b) \u2229 (\u03a3 \u00d7 W \u22a5 \u2295 \u039b),\nand V the corresponding enveloped sphere congruence.\nIt is natural to ask when \u03a3 is a local product of immersions of a p-manifold and an (m\u2212p)manifold into the spaceforms associated to W and W \u22a5 (where 0 6 p 6 k, 0 6 m\u2212p 6 n\u2212k).\nIt is clear that this implies that the lines \u2227k+1 W and \u2227n\u2212k+1 W \u22a5 lie in \u2227p+1 V \u2297 \u2227k\u2212p V \u22a5\nand \u2227m\u2212p+1 V \u2297 \u2227n\u2212k\u2212(m\u2212p) V \u22a5 respectively. Hence a unit vector \u03c9 in \u2227k+1 W may be\nwritten \u03c9 = \u03b8 \u2227 v \u2227 \u03c7 with \u03b8 \u2208 \u2227p \u039b(1) , v \u2208 V and \u03c7 \u2208 \u2227k\u2212p V \u22a5 (all decomposable). Since\nwe require that \u039b 6\u2286 W \u222a W \u22a5 , we must have \u03b8 \u2208\n/ \u039b \u2227 \u2227p\u22121 \u039b(1) and v \u2208\n/ \u039b\u22a5 . On the other\nhand, \u039b \u2295 \u039b\u0302 has nontrivial intersection with W , so without loss, we can take v \u2208 \u039b \u2295 \u039b\u0302\nand \u03b8 \u2208 \u2227p U , where U := (\u039b \u2295 \u039b\u0302)\u22a5 \u2229 V\nSimilarly \u2227n\u2212k+1 W \u22a5 contains a unit vector of the form \u03c9 \u22a5 = \u03b8 \u22a5 \u2227 v \u22a5 \u2227 \u03c7\u22a5 with \u03b8 \u22a5 \u2208\nm\u2212p\n\u2227\nU , v \u22a5 \u2208 \u039b \u2295 \u039b\u0302 and \u03c7\u22a5 \u2208 \u2227n\u2212k\u2212(m\u2212p) V \u22a5 (all decomposable).\nObserve that the central sphere congruence may be written V\u03a3 = \u039b \u2295 U \u2295 \u039b\u0302\u03a3 , where\n\u039b\u0302\u03a3 = exp(\u2212H V )\u039b\u0302 is the null complement to \u039b in U \u22a5 \u2229 V\u03a3 . It follows that for nontrivial\nsplittings (0 < p < m), the conditions on W, W \u22a5 that we have obtained have a homological\nconsequence: [\u03c9]S n |\u03a3 = [\u03c9]\u03a3 = \u03b8 \u2297 (v mod \u039b\u22a5 ) \u2297 \u03c7 and is a decomposable section of\nH0 (T \u2217\u03a3, \u2227p+1 V\u03a3 ) \u2297 \u2227k\u2212p V\u03a3\u22a5 = \u2227p (T \u03a3 \u039b) L \u2297 \u2227k\u2212p V\u03a3\u22a5\n\n\u2282 \u2227k (T S n \u039b) L|\u03a3 = H0 (T \u2217S n , S n \u00d7 \u2227k+1 Rn+1,1 )|\u03a3 ,\n\nand similarly for [\u03c9 \u22a5 ]S n |\u03a3 . This turns out to be a characterization.\n\nTheorem 13.9. Let W \u2282 Rn+1,1 be a (k + 1)-dimensional subspace with orthogonal space\nW \u22a5 . Then an immersed submanifold of S n r (P (W ) \u222a P (W \u22a5 )) splits locally across the\ninduced product structure as a product of a p-submanifold and an (m \u2212 p)-submanifold (0 <\np < m) if and only if the homology class [\u03c9]S n of some (hence any) nonzero \u03c9 \u2208 \u2227k+1 W\nis a section of \u2227p (T \u03a3 \u039b) L \u2297 \u2227k\u2212p V\u03a3\u22a5 along \u03a3.\nProof. It remains to show that the homological condition implies the splitting. For this\nrecall from \u00a77.3 that [\u03c9]S n and [\u03c9 \u22a5 ]S n are sections of the top exterior powers of the two\ndistributions tangent to the spaceform factors (up to a line bundle), so the homological\ncondition means that one of these distributions meets T \u03a3 \u2295 N \u03a3 (along \u03a3) in the sum of\na tangential p-plane and a normal (k \u2212 p)-plane. The other distribution, being orthogonal,\nthen meets T \u03a3 \u2295 N \u03a3 in a tangential (m \u2212 p)-plane and a normal (n \u2212 k \u2212 (m \u2212 p))-plane.\nNow the tangential planes are integrable, and this locally splits \u03a3.\n\u0003\nIn the case k = 1, the above theorem has an intuitively clear meaning.\nCorollary 13.10. The vector field K on S n associated to a 2-dimensional subspace W of\nRn+1,1 is tangent to \u03a3 if and only if \u03a3 is an open subset of a revolute, a cylinder or a\ncone, over a submanifold of the same codimension in Hn\u22121 , Rn\u22121 or S n\u22121 respectively. In\nthis case the homology class of \u03c9\u221e along \u03a3 is the corresponding tangent vector field.\nThe properties of these submanifolds can easily be read off from the data on \u03a3 by\nimposing the condition that \u03c9, here equal to \u03b8 \u2227 v, with \u03b8 \u2208 U and v \u2208 \u039b \u2295 \u039b\u0302, is parallel.\nWe obtain immediately that N V \u03b8 = 0 = N V v, so that V is a curvature sphere, constant\nalong the curvature lines in the direction of K = \u03b8 \u2297 (v mod \u039b\u22a5 ), \u039b\u0302 is another envelope,\nand N V (hence IIV ) preserves the decomposition T \u03a3 = <K> \u2295 K \u22a5 \u2229 T \u03a3 induced by the\nproduct metric on S 1 \u00d7 Hn\u22121 , R \u00d7 Rn\u22121 or H1 \u00d7 S n\u22121 .\n\nExample 13.11. Recall that a (Dupin) cyclide in S 3 is an orbit of a two dimensional abelian\nsubgroup of the M\u00f6bius group M\u00f6b(3). Dupin's classification of the cyclides can be read\noff easily from the above. In the span of a two dimensional abelian subalgebra of so(4, 1)\n\n\f56\n\nFRANCIS E. BURSTALL AND DAVID M. J. CALDERBANK\n\nwe can always find a basis of decomposable elements (just consider the Jordan normal\nform). These decomposables define two orthogonal 2-planes in R4,1 , reducing the geometry\nto H2 \u00d7 S 1 , R2 \u00d7 R, or S 2 \u00d7 H1 , and the cyclide as a surface of revolution, a cylinder,\nor a cone, according to whether the 2-plane is spacelike, degenerate, or timelike. At most\none of the planes can be degenerate or timelike. Therefore a cyclide, if not totally umbilic,\nis a channel surface in two ways, and is either a circular torus of revolution, a cylinder of\nrevolution, or a cone of revolution.\nIf the splitting is trivial (i.e., p = 0 or p = m), then [v\u221e ] is no longer a pure tangential\nclass in general. Indeed, as we have seen in the case k = 0 (or k = n) of the spaceform\ngeometries of the previous paragraph (\u00a713.2), [v\u221e ] is tangent to \u03a3 if and only if the\nimmersion (into the spaceform factor) is minimal.\n13.4. Orthogonal systems and Dupin's Theorem. An extreme form of symmetry\nbreaking is given by n-tuply orthogonal systems. Suppose Q\nthat we have a local diffeomorphism \u039b \u2282 \u03a3 \u00d7 Rn+1,1 of a product of 1-manifolds \u03a3 = ni=1 \u03a3i with S n = P(L), such\nthat the factors are orthogonal for the induced conformal metric. Let Ui = dXi (\u039b), where\nXi is a nonvanishing tangent vector field to \u03a3i pulled back to the product. Thus the Ui are\nmutually orthogonal rank 2 bundles with sum \u039b\u22a5 and intersection \u039b. For each i we have\na one parameter family of hypersurfaces \u03a3xi in S n by fixing the ith coordinate xi \u2208 \u03a3i as\na parameter. Dupin's Theorem is the following one.\nTheorem 13.12. For i 6= j, the families \u03a3xi and \u03a3xj meet each other in curvature lines.\n0(i)\n\nProof. It suffices to show that Xj is tangent to a curvature line on \u03a3xi , i.e., IIXj Xk = 0\nfor k \u2208\n/ {i, j}. This is a multiple of (dXj dXk \u03c3k , ui ) where ui is a unit section of Ui and \u03c3k\nis a section of \u039b pulled back from \u03a3k . Now we simply observe that dXj dXk \u03c3k = dXk dXj \u03c3k\nsince [Xj , Xk ] = 0, which is a section of Uk , since dXj \u03c3k is a section of \u039b (for j 6= k). As\nUk is orthogonal to Ui (for i 6= k), we are done.\n\u0003\nThe proofs in the literature take a euclidean point of view of this result. Ours is quite\ndifferent, and thus avoids computing the Levi-Civita connection of the induced metric.\n14. Constrained Willmore surfaces\n14.1. Definition and spectral deformation.\nDefinition 14.1. An immersion \u039b of a surface \u03a3 in S n is said to be constrained Willmore\nif there is a holomorphic quadratic differential q \u2208 C \u221e (\u03a3, S 2 T0\u2217\u03a3) (i.e., dq = 0) such that\n(H\u2207 )\u2217 (II0 ) = hq, II0 i. We refer to such a holomorphic quadratic differential q as a Lagrange\nmultiplier for the constrained Willmore immersion. If (H\u2207 )\u2217 (II0 ) = 0 the surface is said to\nbe Willmore or conformally minimal.\nLet g be an ambient metric of constant curvature, and let D be the induced exact Weyl\nconnection on \u03a3. Then, by (11.16) and (11.12)\u2013(11.13), we have\n(H\u2207 )\u2217 (II0 ) = \u2212 div \u2207,D AD + hr0D,\u03a3 , II0 i = \u2206\u2207,D H g + hH g (II0 ), II0 i\n\nso that the constrained Willmore equation in a spaceform may be written\n\u2206\u2207,D H g + hH g (II0 ), II0 i = hq, II0 i.\n\nIn codimension one, hH g (II0 ), II0 i = |II0 |2 H g = 2(|H g |2 \u2212 K g )H g , where K g is the gaussian\ncurvature det IIg . This yields the usual form of the Willmore equation when q = 0 and g is\nflat [81].\nAn immediate consequence of this formulation is the well known fact that surfaces with\nparallel mean curvature in a spaceform are constrained Willmore (including CMC surfaces\n\n\fCONFORMAL SUBMANIFOLD GEOMETRY I\u2013III\n\n57\n\nin codimension one), while minimal surfaces are Willmore. For this, we take q = H g (II0 ) and\nobserve that q is holomorphic by virtue of the Codazzi equation (11.21c), equation (11.13),\nand the fact that \u2207D H g = 0.\nThe following proposition provides a more general class.\nProposition 14.2. Let \u03a3 be a surface in a spaceform with ambient metric g. Suppose\nthat H g = H+ + H\u2212 where H\u00b1 are complex conjugate sections of N \u2217\u03a3 \u2297 C such that\n(\u2207D H\u2212 )0,1 = 0 and h\u2207D H\u2212 , H\u2212 i = 0. Then \u03a3 is constrained Willmore.\nProof. Since (\u2207D H\u2212 )0,1 = 0 = (\u2207D H+ )1,0 , we have\n\u2206\u2207,D H g = div \u2207,D (\u2207D H+ )1,0 + (\u2207D H\u2212 )1,0 + (\u2207D H+ )0,1 + (\u2207D H\u2212 )0,1\n\n\u0001\n\n= div \u2207,D \u2212(\u2207D H+ )1,0 + (\u2207D H\u2212 )1,0 + (\u2207D H+ )0,1 \u2212 (\u2207D H\u2212 )0,1\n= i div \u2207,D \u2217\u2207D (H+ \u2212 H\u2212 )\n\n\u0001\n\n= i\u2217R\u2207 * (H+ \u2212 H\u2212 ).\n\nHence, using the Ricci equation (11.29), we have\n\u2206\u2207,D H g + hH g (II0 ), II0 i = hq, II0 i\nwhere q = 2H\u2212 (II0 )2,0 + 2H+ (II0 )0,2 . It remains to see that q (or equivalently q 2,0 ) is\n\u2207\nholomorphic. Since (\u2207D H\u2212 )0,1 = 0, it suffices to show that the contraction of \u2202 (II0 )2,0\n\u2207\nwith H\u2212 is zero. But \u2202 (II0 )2,0 = (d \u2207,D II0 )2,1 , which is a multiple of (\u2207D H g )1,0 \u2227 c\nby (11.21c) and (11.13). Since (\u2207D H g )1,0 = \u2207D H\u2212 , the contraction with H\u2212 vanishes by\nthe second equation on H\u2212 .\n\u0003\nCorollary 14.3. Let \u03a3 be cooriented codimension two surface in a spaceform with ambient\nmetric g, and suppose H g is holomorphic with respect to the natural complex structure on\nN \u2217 \u03a3 induced by its conformal structure and orientation, and the holomorphic structure\ninduced by \u2207D . Then \u03a3 is constrained Willmore.\nProof. Let H+ = (H g )0,1 and H\u2212 = (H g )1,0 be the projections of H g onto the eigenspaces\nin N \u2217 \u03a3 \u2297 C of the complex structure. Since H g is holomorphic, (\u2207D H\u2212 )0,1 = 0. On the\nother hand, these eigenspaces are null, so 0 = dhH\u2212 , H\u2212 i = 2h\u2207D H\u2212 , H\u2212 i. Hence we can\napply the proposition.\n\u0003\nIn the case that g is flat, this result is due to Bohle [9].\nOne reason to be interested in constrained Willmore surfaces is that they admit a spectral\ndeformation (in arbitrary codimension) and hence an integrable systems interpretation.\nTheorem 14.4. Let \u039b \u2282 \u03a3 \u00d7 Rn+1,1 be an immersed surface in S n with Gauss\u2013Codazzi\u2013\nRicci data (c, M\u03a3 , \u2207, II0 ), and quadratic differential q \u2208 C \u221e (\u03a3, S02 T \u2217\u03a3). Then the following\nconditions are equivalent.\n(i) \u03a3 is constrained Willmore with Lagrange multiplier q.\n(ii) (c, M\u03a3 + 21 (e2tJ \u2212 1)q, \u2207, etJ II0 ) satisfies the Gauss\u2013Codazzi\u2013Ricci equations for some\nt\u2208\n/ \u03c0Z.\n\n(iii) (c, M\u03a3 + 12 (e2tJ \u22121)q, \u2207, etJ II0 ) satisfies the Gauss\u2013Codazzi\u2013Ricci equations and defines\na constrained Willmore immersion of \u03a3 in S n for all t \u2208 R.\n\n\f58\n\nFRANCIS E. BURSTALL AND DAVID M. J. CALDERBANK\n\nProof. The Gauss\u2013Codazzi\u2013Ricci equations hold for the data in (ii)\u2013(iii) iff\n0 = C \u03a3 + 21 (e2tJ \u2212 1)dq + hB\u2207 (II0 )i\n\n0 = (H\u2207 + 12 (e2tJ \u2212 1)q)\u2217 (etJ JII0 )\n\n= cos t(H\u2207 )\u2217 (JII0 ) \u2212 sin t(H\u2207 )\u2217 (II0 ) + 21 h(e2tJ \u2212 1)q, etJ JII0 i\n\n0 = R\u2207 \u2212 II0 \u2227 S0\n\n(using (11.24)), and we observe that 12 h(e2tJ \u2212 1)q, etJ JII0 i = sin thq, II0 i. Hence the\nGauss\u2013Codazzi\u2013Ricci equations hold for all t iff they hold for some t \u2208\n/ \u03c0Z iff dq = 0\nand (H\u2207 )\u2217 (II0 ) = hq, II0 i.\n\u0003\nOne way to realize this integrable system is to lift the spectral deformation to a family\nof flat connections. This yields an alternative definition of constrained Willmore surfaces.\nTheorem 14.5. Let \u039b \u2282 \u03a3 \u00d7 Rn+1,1 and (c, M\u03a3 , \u2207, II0 , q) be as in the previous Theorem.\nThen the following conditions are equivalent.\n(i) \u03a3 is constrained Willmore with Lagrange multiplier q.\n(ii) There is a T \u2217M -valued 1-form \u03be \u2208 \u03a91 (\u03a3, stab(\u039b)\u22a5 ) \u2282 \u03a91 (\u03a3, so(VM )) with [\u03be] = q\nh\nsuch that d h \u03be = 0 and d D \u2212\u03be,\u2207 \u2217N = 0.\n(iii) There is a T \u2217\u03a3-valued 1-form \u03be \u2208 \u03a91 (\u03a3, stab(\u039b)\u22a5 \u2229 so(V\u03a3 )) \u2282 \u03a91 (\u03a3, so(V\u03a3 )) with\n[\u03be] = q such that d + (etJ \u2212 1)N + 21 (e2tJ \u2212 1)\u03be is flat for all t \u2208 R.\nProof. The constrained Willmore equation may be written 0 = (H\u2207 \u2212 q)\u2217 II0 = \u2212(H\u2207 \u2212\nq)\u2217 J 2 II0 . Now by Proposition 12.1, \u2217N is the differential lift of JII0 with respect to D\u03a3 ,\nhence also with respect to D\u03a3 \u2212 \u03be provided \u03be is a T \u2217M -valued 1-form. It follows that the\nh\nconstrained Willmore equation is equivalent to d D \u2212\u03be,\u2207 \u2217N = 0, where \u03be is the differential\nlift of q (with respect to D\u03a3 ), the equation d h \u03be = 0 then being equivalent to dq = 0.\nThe rest follows by computing the curvature of the connections in (iii), and applying\nProposition 12.2.\n\u0003\n14.2. Harmonicity, the functional and duality. Theorem 14.5, with q = \u03be = 0,\nhas two more-or-less immediate corollaries. It also provides a simple way to obtain the\nconstrained Willmore equation from the functional. These results are all well known [18, 10],\nbut they are derived with particular ease in our formalism.\nCorollary 14.6. A immersed surface in S n is Willmore if and only if its central sphere\ncongruence is harmonic.\n\u2207\n\nProof. The central sphere congruence is harmonic if and only if d D \u2217N = 0. However,\n\u2207\n\u0003\nsince Q is tracelike and II0 is trace-free, d D \u2217N = d h \u2217N .\nCorollary 14.7. If the central sphere congruence of a Willmore surface has a second envelope (which is generic in codimension one) then this envelope is also a Willmore surface.\nProof. Since d h N = 0 and d h \u2217N = 0 we have that r D,V\u03a3 \u2227 S0 = 0 and r D,V\u03a3 \u2227 JS0 = 0.\nAway from umbilics (i.e., on a dense open set because \u03a3 is not totally umbilic, since it has\na second envelope, and II0 is analytic) it follows that the symmetric trace-free part of r D,V\u03a3\nis zero. Hence the second envelope has the same conformal structure and the same central\nsphere congruence. Since this is harmonic, the second envelope is also Willmore.\n\u0003\nTheorem 14.8. A compact surface is (constrained) Willmore, as in Definition 14.1, if\nand only if it is a critical point of W for immersions of \u03a3 (inducing the same conformal\nmetric on \u03a3 in the constrained case).\n\n\fCONFORMAL SUBMANIFOLD GEOMETRY I\u2013III\n\n59\n\nR\nR\nProof. Since N vanishes on \u039b, W = \u03a3 |N |2 = \u03a3 |dS|2 , where S is the central sphere\ncongruence (viewed as a map from \u03a3 into the grassmannian of (3, 1)-planes in S n ). The\nR\n\u2207\nfirst variation of this functional is dW(\u1e60) = \u03a3 hd D \u2217N , \u1e60i, where \u1e60 : \u03a3 \u2192 m denotes\n\u2207\nthe variation of S. Now d D \u2217N = d h \u2217N and, by Proposition 12.1, \u2202d h \u2217N = 0, so that\nN \u2208 \u03a92 (\u03a3, m \u2229 stab(\u039b)\u22a5 ) and hence dW(\u1e60) vanishes automatically when \u1e60 takes values\nin C \u221e (\u03a3, m \u2229 stab(\u039b)) = im \u2202 (this is really\nduality for\nR justh a special case\nR of Poincar\u00e9\n0\nLie algebra homology). Hence dW(\u1e60) = \u03a3 h[d \u2217N ], [\u1e60]i = \u03a3 hdBGG (JII ), [\u1e60]i, with\n[\u1e60] \u2208 C \u221e (\u03a3, N \u03a3) and dBGG (JII0 ) is \u2217(H\u2207 )\u2217 (II0 ), up to a sign.\nFor variations of S coming from variations of the immersion, [\u1e60] is essentially the normal\nvariation vector field. For general variations, [\u1e60] can therefore be arbitrary, whereas for\nconformal variations are characterized by S0 [\u1e60] \u2208 C \u221e (\u03a3, sym0 (T \u03a3)) being in the image of\nthe conformal Killing operator X 7\u2192 LX c. This last is adjoint to d on quadratic differentials.\nThe result now follows.\n\u0003\n15. Isothermic surfaces\n15.1. Definition and spectral deformation. The classical definition of an isothermic\nsurface is a surface admitting a conformal curvature line coordinate, i.e., a conformal\ncoordinate z = x + iy with respect to which the second fundamental form is diagonal. This\nis a conformally-invariant condition, and there is a manifestly invariant way to state it,\nwhich we take as our fundamental definition.\nDefinition 15.1. An immersion \u039b of a surface \u03a3 in S n is said to be isothermic if there\nis a nonzero quadratic differential q \u2208 C \u221e (\u03a3, S 2 T0\u2217\u03a3) \u2282 \u03a91 (\u03a3, T \u2217\u03a3) which is holomorphic\n(i.e., dq = 0) and commutes with shape operators in the sense that q \u2227 S0 = 0.\nRemarks 15.2. Thus q (2,0) = dz 2 for some conformal curvature line coordinates z = x + iy.\nThis definition has the merit of using just the Gauss\u2013Codazzi\u2013Ricci data, which only\ndetermine \u03a3 locally up to M\u00f6bius transformation. Hence, in this approach, one can develop\na theory of isothermic surfaces modulo M\u00f6bius transformation.\nAlso note that because the normal components of S0 commute with q, they commute\nwith each other, and so the weightless normal bundle is flat by the Ricci equation.\nWe now show that the new Gauss\u2013Codazzi\u2013Ricci data (c, M\u03a3 + rq, \u2207, II0 ) also define\nan isothermic surface for any r, with the same quadratic differential q (up to a constant\nmultiple). The new surfaces are sometimes called the T-transforms of \u03a3: note that only\nthe M\u00f6bius structure has changed here.\nTheorem 15.3. Let \u039b \u2282 \u03a3 \u00d7 Rn+1,1 be an immersed surface in S n with Gauss\u2013Codazzi\u2013\nRicci data (c, M\u03a3 , \u2207, II0 ), and quadratic differential q \u2208 C \u221e (\u03a3, S02 T \u2217\u03a3). Then the following\nconditions are equivalent.\n(i) \u039b is isothermic with holomorphic commuting quadratic differential q.\n(ii) (c, M\u03a3 + rq, \u2207, II0 ) satisfies the Gauss\u2013Codazzi\u2013Ricci equations for some r 6= 0.\n(iii) (c, M\u03a3 +rq, \u2207, II0 ) satisfies the Gauss\u2013Codazzi\u2013Ricci equations and defines a isothermic\nimmersion of \u03a3 in S n for all r \u2208 R.\nProof. The Gauss\u2013Codazzi\u2013Ricci equations hold for the data in (ii)\u2013(iii) iff\n0 = C \u03a3 + rdq + hB\u2207 (II0 )i\n\n0 = (H\u2207 )\u2217 (JII0 ) + rhq, JII0 i\n0 = R\u2207 \u2212 II0 \u2227 S0\n\n\f60\n\nFRANCIS E. BURSTALL AND DAVID M. J. CALDERBANK\n\n(using (11.24)). Clearly these equations hold for all r iff they hold for r = 0 and some\nnonzero r, since then div q = 0 and q is orthogonal to JII0 : since S02 T \u2217\u03a3 has rank 2 this\nlast condition means that every component of II0 commutes with q.\n\u0003\nThe T-transforms give rise an integrable systems interpretation of isothermic surfaces:\nthe Gauss\u2013Codazzi\u2013Ricci data (c, M\u03a3 + rq, \u2207, II0 ) defines a pencil of flat connections on\nV\u03a3 \u2295 V\u03a3\u22a5 . It also yields an alternative definition of an isothermic surface.\n\nTheorem 15.4. Let \u039b \u2282 \u03a3 \u00d7 Rn+1,1 and (c, M\u03a3 , \u2207, II0 , q), be as in the previous Theorem.\nThen the following conditions are equivalent.\n(i) \u039b is isothermic with holomorphic commuting quadratic differential q.\n(ii) There is a T \u2217M -valued 1-form \u03b7 \u2208 \u03a91 (\u03a3, stab(\u039b)\u22a5 ) \u2282 \u03a91 (\u03a3, so(VM )) with [\u03b7] = q\nsuch that d\u03b7 = 0.\n(iii) There is a T \u2217\u03a3-valued 1-form \u03b7 \u2208 \u03a91 (\u03a3, stab(\u039b)\u22a5 \u2229 so(V\u03a3 )) \u2282 \u03a91 (\u03a3, so(V\u03a3 )) with\n[\u03b7] = q such that d + r\u03b7 is flat for all r \u2208 R.\n\nProof. Since d is flat and T \u2217M is abelian, d + r\u03b7 is flat if and only if d\u03b7 = 0. This condition\ncertainly implies that \u2202d h \u03b7 = 0 so that \u03b7 = j h q = q by Proposition 12.2. Now d\u03b7 = 0 if\n\u03a3\n\u0003\nand only if d D \u03b7 = 0 and [N \u2227 \u03b7] = 0, i.e., if and only if dq = 0 and q \u2227 S0 = 0.\nIn subsequent work, we shall focus on (ii) above as our main definition of an isothermic\nsurface (this definition also generalizes [17]). The classical definition of isothermic surfaces\nis essentially a homological version of this 'integrable systems' definition. In the formulation\ngiven by (iii), the T-transform of \u039b, with parameter r, is \u039b itself, but viewed as a (local)\nimmersion in the space of (d + r\u03b7)-parallel null lines in \u03a3 \u00d7 Rn+1,1 . The corresponding\nmap into the space of d-parallel null lines is obtained from this via a gauge transformation.\n15.2. Examples and symmetry breaking. The examples of isothermic surfaces which\nare easy to describe fall into three classes, all of which exhibit some sort of symmetry\nbreaking in the sense of \u00a7\u00a713.2\u201313.3.\nCones, cylinders, revolutes and their generalizations. The simplest examples of isothermic\nsurfaces in S 3 are cones over a curve in S 2 , cylinders over a curve in R2 , and revolutes\n(surfaces of revolution) over a curve on H2 . These are the 2-dimensional case of the\nsubmanifolds described in \u00a713.3. In higher codimension, we obtain a larger class than\njust the cones, cylinders and revolutes in this way. We focus on the nondegenerate case\n(generalizing cones and revolutes), but the degenerate case is similar.\nSuppose that\nRn+1,1 = Rk,1 \u2295 Rn\u2212k+1\nand so S n r S k\u22121 = Hk \u00d7 S n\u2212k . We claim that any Cartesian product of curves \u03b31 (s) in\nHk and \u03b32 (t) in S n\u2212k is isothermic. The product surface \u03a3 = \u03a31 \u00d7 \u03a32 has a natural lift\n\u03c3(s, t) := \u03b31 (s) + \u03b32 (t) into the light-cone. Clearly s and t are curvature line coordinates,\nand if \u03b31 and \u03b32 are parameterized by arc-length, then, differentiating \u03c3(s, t), we see that\nthey are also conformal.\nWe observe that we can take \u03b7 = \u03c3 \u25b3 (d\u03b31 \u2212 d\u03b32 ), where \u25b3 denotes the pairing Rn+1,1 \u00d7\nRn+1,1 \u2192 so(n + 1, 1) with (u \u25b3 w)(v) = (u, v)w \u2212 (u, w)v. Indeed \u03b7 takes values in the\nnilradical of \u039b, so it remains to show that it is closed. Well:\nd\u03b7 = (d\u03b31 + d\u03b32 ) \u2227\n\u25b3 (d\u03b31 \u2212 d\u03b32 )\n\n(wedge product, using \u25b3 to multiply coefficients). Now d\u03b3i \u2227\n\u25b3 d\u03b3i = 0 since these are wedges\nof (pullbacks of) 1-forms on 1-manifolds so we are left with \u2212d\u03b31 \u2227\n\u25b3 d\u03b32 + d\u03b32 \u2227\n\u25b3 d\u03b31 , which\nvanishes because the wedge product of 1-forms and \u25b3 are both skew.\n\n\fCONFORMAL SUBMANIFOLD GEOMETRY I\u2013III\n\n61\n\nThis class of surfaces is stable under T-transform: for this we need to find (d + r\u03b7)stable subspaces U1 and U2 = U1\u22a5 of \u03a3 \u00d7 Rn+1,1 with ranks k + 1 and n \u2212 k + 1, such\nthat \u03c3 induces the same splitting of \u03a3 = \u03a31 \u00d7 \u03a32 . To do that we make an Ansatz that\nU1 = im d\u03b31 \u2295 <\u03b31 + a(r)(\u03b31 + \u03b32 )> and hence U2 = im d\u03b32 \u2295 <\u03b32 + a(r)(\u03b31 + \u03b32 )> (with\na(r) a constant for fixed r). Let X1 and X2 be vector fields on \u03a31 and \u03a32 respectively,\npulled back to the product. Then we compute\n(d + r\u03b7)X2 (\u03b31 + a(r)(\u03b31 + \u03b32 )) = a(r)dX2 \u03b32 \u2212 r(\u03b31 , \u03b31 )dX2 \u03b32 .\n\nThis lies in U1 iff it is zero, which (assuming (\u03b31 , \u03b31 ) = \u22121) gives a(r) = \u2212r. For the\nstability of U1 , it remains to consider v \u2208 im d\u03b31 :\n(d + r\u03b7)v\n\nmod im d\u03b31 = \u2212(dv, \u03b31 )\u03b31 \u2212 r(d\u03b31 , v)(\u03b31 + \u03b32 ) = (v, d\u03b31 )(\u03b31 \u2212 r(\u03b31 + \u03b32 )),\n\nwhich lies in U1 as required. The stability of U2 follows by orthogonality. Notice that U1\nand U2 become degenerate and intersecting at r = 1/2, then change signature, so that at\nr = 1 we recover the original product in reverse order.\nWe remark that Tojeiro's definition [77] of isothermic submanifolds of higher dimension\ngeneralizes these examples: his submanifolds are extrinsic products of curves in spaceforms.\nCMC surfaces in spaceforms. Another well-known (and classical) class of isothermic surfaces are the CMC surfaces in R3 (i.e., surfaces of constant mean curvature H with respect\nto the induced metric, also called H-surfaces) or in 3-dimensional spaceforms [7, 6]. The\ninduced metric identifies II0 with a quadratic differential called the Hopf differential, and\nthe Codazzi equation (in the spaceform) shows that this is holomorphic (and of course, it\ncommutes with itself).\nIn higher codimension, the mean curvature is a conormal vector, and the most natural\nnotion of 'constant mean curvature' is parallel mean curvature (using the connection on the\nconormal bundle induced by the spaceform metric), but this essentially forces \u03a3 to have\ncodimension one or two; however, as shown in [13], a more general class of surfaces, called\ngeneralized H-surfaces, are isothermic. We present a novel analysis of this case.\nSuppose the spaceform geometry in S n is defined by v\u221e \u2208 Rn+1,1 and let \u03c3 \u2208 C \u221e (\u03a3, \u039b)\nbe the spaceform lift of a submanifold of S n (so (\u03c3, v\u221e ) = \u22121), which is the gauge induced\nby the spaceform metric g. Let \u03be be a parallel unit section of V\u03a3\u22a5 . Now set \u03b7 = \u03c3 \u25b3 d\u03be.\nThis clearly takes values in the nilradical of \u039b, so it remains to determine when it is closed,\ng\ni.e., when d\u03c3 \u2227\n\u25b3 d\u03be = 0. For this, let Vg = exp(H )V\u03a3 be the tangent sphere congruence\ng\nin the spaceform, so that \u03beg = exp(H )\u03be = \u03be + hH g l, \u03bei\u03c3, where l is dual to \u03c3. Thus\nd\u03be = d\u03be g \u2212 d(hH g l, \u03bei\u03c3) and d\u03be g = N g \u03be = \u2212Sg \u03be = \u2212S0 \u03be \u2212 hH g l, \u03beid\u03c3, since Ag = 0.\n0\ng\nNow d\u03c3 \u2227\n\u25b3 S \u03be is identically zero, so d\u03c3 \u2227\n\u25b3 d\u03be = 0 if and only if dhH l, \u03bei = 0, i.e., the \u03be\ng\ncomponent of the mean curvature covector H is constant.\nThese are the generalized H-surfaces. The quadratic differential q is the corresponding\n(\u03be) component of II0 , although it is not so obvious to see directly that this commutes with\nthe other components. Observe that by construction \u03b7 * v\u221e + d\u03be = 0. It follows that for all\nr \u2208 R, v\u221e + r\u03be is parallel with respect to d + r\u03b7. This conserved quantity provides another\nway to characterize generalized H-surfaces, and we shall explore this further in the sequel\nto this paper.\nQuadrics. Quadrics are natural generalizations of spheres in euclidean space. After the\nstudy of surfaces of constant nonzero gaussian curvature (K-surfaces), which are isometric\nto spheres or their hyperbolic analogues, surfaces isometric to quadrics were of great interest\nin classical differential geometry. An important classical observation is that quadrics are\nisothermic (see [43]), and this was generalized to conformal quadrics by Darboux [39, pp.\n212\u2013219]. This is often considered to be surprising [13, 56], since quadric surfaces live most\nnaturally in the projective geometry of RP 3 , not the conformal geometry of S 3 . Darboux's\n\n\f62\n\nFRANCIS E. BURSTALL AND DAVID M. J. CALDERBANK\n\nargument fits well into our formalism, so we sketch it here: in fact Darboux restricts\nattention to diagonal quadrics, so we complement his analysis by describing some of the\ngeometry in the general case.\nA quadric Q in S 3 is determined by a matrix A \u2208 sym(R4,1 ), which is not a multiple\nof the identity: then Q = {<\u03c3> \u2208 P(L) : (\u03c3, \u03c3) = 0 = (A\u03c3, \u03c3)}. Conversely, the quadric\nQ only determines A up to affine transformations A 7\u2192 aA + bI (a, b \u2208 R, a 6= 0). The\ngeometric idea behind Darboux's construction is to extend this affine action to a projective\none: the matrices (aA + bI)(cA + dI)\u22121 (a, b, c, d \u2208 R, ad \u2212 bc 6= 0) determine a one\nparameter family of quadrics. (In fact these quadrics are confocal, but we do not need this\nhere.) Given A, we can parameterize the family by the matrices A(I \u2212 uA)\u22121 .\nNow observe that for fixed \u03c3, det(I \u2212 uA)(A(I \u2212 uA)\u22121 \u03c3, \u03c3) = 0 is a quartic in u, whose\nleading coefficient vanishes if (\u03c3, \u03c3) = 0. The roots u1 , u2 , u3 of this cubic determine three\nquadrics in the family passing through <\u03c3> \u2208 P(L). Now observe that the conditions\n(A(I \u2212 u1 A)\u22121 \u03c3, \u03c3) = 0 = (A(I \u2212 u2 A)\u22121 \u03c3, \u03c3)\n\nimply that\n0=\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\nA(1 \u2212 u2 A) \u2212 A(1 \u2212 u1 A) (I \u2212 u1 A)\u22121 (I \u2212 u2 A)\u22121 \u03c3, \u03c3\n\n= (u1 \u2212 u2 )(A(I \u2212 u1 A)\u22121 \u03c3, A(I \u2212 u2 A)\u22121 \u03c3)\n\nso that distinct quadrics in the family meet each other orthogonally at <\u03c3> \u2208 P(L). By\nDupin's Theorem, they therefore meet in curvature lines.\nTo see that this gives rise to conformal curvature line coordinates, we now follow Darboux\nand assume A is diagonalized, with distinct eigenvalues (1/a0 , 1/a1 , 1/a2 , 1/a3 , 1/a4 ) in\ncoordinates x = (x0 , x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 ) on R4,1 such that (x, x) = \u2212x20 + x21 + x22 + x23 + x24 .\nThus A(I \u2212 uA)\u22121 has eigenvalues 1/(ai \u2212 u). Then, for x null, we can solve for xi in\nterms of the parameters (u1 , u2 , u3 ) of the three quadrics passing through that point to get\nx20 = \u2212c(u1 \u2212 a0 )(u2 \u2212 a0 )(u3 \u2212 a0 )/f \u2032 (a0 ) and x2i = c(u1 \u2212 ai )(u2 \u2212 ai )(u3 \u2212 ai )/f \u2032 (ai ) for\ni = 1, . . . 4, where f (u) = (u \u2212 a0 )(u \u2212 a1 )(u \u2212 a2 )(u \u2212 a3 )(u \u2212 a4 ) and c is an overall scale.\nBy differentiating these formulae for xi , it follows that the conformal metric on S 3 has\na representative metric\n(15.1)\n\n(u2 \u2212 u1 )(u3 \u2212 u1 ) 2 (u3 \u2212 u2 )(u1 \u2212 u2 ) 2 (u1 \u2212 u3 )(u2 \u2212 u3 ) 2\ndu1 +\ndu2 +\ndu3\nf (u1 )\nf (u2 )\nf (u3 )\n\nin these coordinates. Thus (u1 , u2 ) are conformal curvature line coordinates on the quadrics\nwith u3 constant, which are therefore isothermic.\nIf A is not diagonalizable as above, the coordinates (u1 , u2 , u3 ) are still well defined,\nand so a continuity argument gives the same representative metric (15.1) for the conformal\nstructure on S 3 , where f (u) is the characteristic polynomial of A\u22121 .\nThis argument almost provides the conceptual explanation sought in [13]: it shows that\nconformal geometry equips a quadric with a natural conjugate net; then, perhaps not so\nsurprisingly, this net is orthogonal, and gives rise to the conformal curvature line coordinates\nwhich show that the quadric is isothermic.\nWe end by remarking that the eigenvectors of A can be used to break the symmetry\nto that of a spaceform, and then the quadric is realized as a quadric in a spaceform. In\nparticular, for matrices with a null eigenvector, we recover the quadrics in euclidean space.\n15.3. When is a surface isothermic? The definition we have given of an isothermic\nsurface has the disadvantage that it does not characterize when a surface admits such a\nquadratic differential q. There is also a subtle global issue here: q might exist locally (near\nany point, perhaps only in a dense open set), but not globally on \u03a3. However, q is unique\nup to a constant multiple away from umbilic points: it must be a pointwise multiple of\n\n\fCONFORMAL SUBMANIFOLD GEOMETRY I\u2013III\n\n63\n\nany nonvanishing component hII0 , \u03bei of II0 and this multiple is determined up to a constant\nsince q is holomorphic. Hence q is globally defined on the universal cover of the open subset\nU where II0 is non-vanishing (or equivalently it may be viewed as a holomorphic quadratic\ndifferential with values in a flat line bundle L on U ).\nIn the case that the central sphere congruence has a second envelope, i.e., there is a\n0\n0\nWeyl derivative D 0 with 0 = AD = \u2212 div \u2207,D S0 , an intrinsic characterization is available.\nWriting S0 = S \u2297 \u03be for a weightless unit normal vector \u03be we first see that such a second\nenvelope can only exist if \u03be is parallel, and then D 0 is the Weyl derivative of a second\n0\nenvelope iff div D S = 0. If the weightless normal bundle is flat, it follows that V \u2295 <\u03be>\nis constant, and so can assume without loss that we are in codimension one, with S = S0 .\nSince AD+\u03b3 = AD + \u03b3 \u25e6 S0 , it then follows that such a second envelope exists precisely\non the set where either N = 0 or S0 6= 0. In the latter case, the second envelope is unique,\nand D 0 can be determined from an arbitrary Weyl structure D via D + (S0 )\u22121 div D S0 .\nNow any commuting quadratic differential may be written q = \u03c3S0 , and it is holomorphic\nif and only if D 0 \u03c3 = 0. Such a (nonzero) \u03c3 exists if and only if D is exact. This turns out\nto be the classical assertion that\na surface is isothermic iff its central sphere congruence is Ribaucour.\nFurthermore, this gives an equation for isothermic surfaces. Let D be the unique Weyl\nderivative with D(|S0 |2 ) = 0. Then D is exact and so, since (S0 )\u22121 = 2S0 /|S0 |2 , D 0 =\nD + 2S0 div D S0 /|S0 |2 , which is locally exact if and only if d(S0 div D S0 /|S0 |2 ) = 0. This\nmay be written in a conformally invariant way as d(\u2217hB \u2207 (II0 )i/|II0 |2 ) = 0 (simply expand\nthe definition of B using the Weyl derivative D).\n16. M\u00f6bius-flat submanifolds\n16.1. Definition and spectral deformation. Let \u03a3 be a submanifold of S n with flat\nweightless normal bundle. We wish to impose the condition that there is a enveloped sphere\ncongruence V inducing a flat conformal M\u00f6bius structure on \u03a3. For m > 3, all enveloped\nsphere congruences induce the same conformal M\u00f6bius structure on \u03a3, since they induce\nthe same conformal structure. On the other hand by equation (9.10), when m = 2, the\nconformal M\u00f6bius structure induced by V has HV = H\u03a3 \u2212 q with q = H V (II0 ), hence it is\nflat iff q is a Cotton\u2013York potential, i.e., dq = C \u03a3 . Since the weightless normal bundle is\nflat q commutes with the shape operators in the sense that q \u2227 S0 = 0. (Conversely, if q is\nnonzero, the flatness of \u2207 follows from this.)\nThis motivates the following definition.\nDefinition 16.1. An immersion \u039b of \u03a3 (dim \u03a3 > 2) in S n is called M\u00f6bius-flat if it has\nflat weightless normal bundle, and either m > 3 and \u03a3 is conformally flat, or m = 2 and \u03a3\nadmits a commuting Cotton\u2013York potential (CCYP), i.e., there exists q \u2208 C \u221e (\u03a3, S 0 T \u2217\u03a3)\nwith dq = C \u03a3 and q \u2227 S0 = 0. (For m > 3, we set q = 0.)\nConversely, if \u03a3 is M\u00f6bius-flat, then for m > 3 any enveloped sphere congruence induces\nthis flat conformal structure; for m = 2, an enveloped sphere congruence V induces the\nflat conformal M\u00f6bius structure H\u03a3 \u2212 q iff q = H V (II0 ). If q = 0, we can take V to be\nthe central sphere congruence; otherwise, on the open set where q is nonzero, we can write\nII0 = q \u2297 U for a normal vector U and set H V = hU, *i/hU, U i. In codimension one the\nenveloped sphere congruence inducing H\u03a3 \u2212 q is clearly unique. (Note that H V extends\nby zero to the zeros of q unless II0 is also zero there.)\nM\u00f6bius-flat submanifolds admit a spectral deformation and hence an integrable systems\ninterpretation.\n\n\f64\n\nFRANCIS E. BURSTALL AND DAVID M. J. CALDERBANK\n\nTheorem 16.2. Let \u039b \u2282 \u03a3 \u00d7 Rn+1,1 be a submanifold of S n of dimension m > 2 with\nGauss\u2013Codazzi\u2013Ricci data (c, M\u03a3 , \u2207, II0 ) and a quadratic differential q \u2208 C \u221e (\u03a3, S02 T \u2217\u03a3)\nwith q = 0 if m > 3. Then the following conditions are equivalent.\n(i) \u03a3 is M\u00f6bius-flat (with CCYP q if m = 2).\n(ii) (c, M\u03a3 + (t2 \u22121)q, \u2207, tII0 ) satisfies the Gauss\u2013Codazzi\u2013Ricci equations for some t \u2208\n/\n{0, \u00b11}.\n(iii) (c, M\u03a3 + (t2 \u22121)q, \u2207, tII0 ) satisfies the Gauss\u2013Codazzi\u2013Ricci equations and defines a\nM\u00f6bius-flat immersion of \u03a3 in S n (with CCYP t2 q if m = 2) for all t \u2208 R.\nProof. The Gauss\u2013Codazzi\u2013Ricci equations hold for the data in (ii)\u2013(iii) iff\n0 = W \u03a3 \u2212 t2 [[id \u2227 Q]] \u2212 t2 S0 \u2227 II0\n\nm>4\n\n0 = C \u03a3 + (t2 \u2212 1)dq + t2 hB\u2207 (II0 )i\n\u2207\n\nm = 2, 3\n\n0\n\n0 = t CCoda II\n\u2207 \u2217\n\n0\n\n2\n\nm>3\n\n0\n\n0 = t(H ) (JII ) + t(t \u2212 1)hq, JII i\n\nm=2\n\n0 = R\u2207 \u2212 t2 II0 \u2227 S0\n\n(using (11.24)). These hold for all t iff they hold for t = 1, W \u03a3 = 0, C \u03a3 = dq, R\u2207 = 0\nand q \u2227 S0 = 0, and it suffices that the equations hold for t = 1 and some t \u2208\n/ {0, \u00b11}. \u0003\nAs in the isothermic case, the integrable systems viewpoint is made most transparent in\nterms of an associated family of flat connections. This also reveals an alternative definition\nwhich will be very useful to us in the sequel to this paper.\nTheorem 16.3. Let \u039b \u2282 \u03a3 \u00d7 Rn+1,1 and (c, M\u03a3 , \u2207, II0 , q) be as in the previous Theorem.\nThen the following conditions are equivalent.\n(i) \u03a3 is M\u00f6bius-flat (with CCYP q if m = 2).\n(ii) There is a sphere congruence V enveloped by \u039b and a 1-form \u03c7V \u2208 \u03a91 (\u03a3, stab(\u039b)\u22a5 )\n\u2207,V\nsuch that d\u03c7V = RD .\n(iii) For any sphere congruence V enveloped by \u039b, there is \u03c7V \u2208 \u03a91 (\u03a3, stab(\u039b)\u22a5 \u2229 so(V ))\nsuch that dtV := D\u2207,V + tN V + (t2 \u2212 1)\u03c7V is flat for all t \u2208 R (or equivalently, since d1 is\nflat, D\u2207,V \u2212 \u03c7V is flat and [N V \u2227 \u03c7V ] = 0).\nWhen m = 2, \u03c7V is a lift of q\u2212H V (II0 ) for a CCYP q. (Notice that the condition in (ii) only\nneeds to be verified for one sphere congruence V ; then the-apparently stronger-condition\nin (iii) holds for all V .)\nProof. We prove (i)\u21d2(iii)\u21d2(ii)\u21d2(i). Clearly (iii)\u21d2(ii) by taking t = 0 and observing that\n\u2207,V\n\nd\u03c7V = d D\n\n\u03c7V + [N V \u2227 \u03c7V ],\n\n\u2207,V\n\n\u2207,V\n\n\u2212 d D \u03c7V .\nwhereas the curvature of D\u2207,V \u2212 \u03c7V is RD\n\u2207,V\nV\nV\nD\nwith \u03c7 as in (ii). By considering the m-component of this\nSuppose d\u03c7 = R\nequation, we see that [\u03b2 \u2227 (\u03c7V )\u22a5 ] = 0, hence \u03c7V \u2208 so(V ) and DV \u2212 \u03c7V is a flat connection\non V . Since exp(\u2212HV ) * (DV \u2212 \u03c7V ) is a flat (hence normal) Cartan connection on V\u03a3\ninducing the same soldering form as D\u03a3 , it must equal D\u03a3 \u2212 q, where q = 0 if m > 3 and\nq is a quadratic differential for m = 2. Hence \u03c7V = QV + q and q is the given quadratic\ndifferential by assumption when m = 2.\nConversely, given (i) we can define \u03c7V = QV + q so that exp(HV ) * (D\u03a3 \u2212 q) = DV \u2212 \u03c7V .\nTo complete the proof of (ii)\u21d2(i)\u21d2(iii), we note that QV \u2227 S0 = Q \u2227 S0 = 0 since the\nweightless normal bundle is flat (the latter equality follows either from the explicit formula\nfor Q or by computing that \u0003 h [Q \u2227 N ] = 0 so that [Q \u2227 N ] is the differential lift of its\n\n\fCONFORMAL SUBMANIFOLD GEOMETRY I\u2013III\n\n65\n\nhomology class, which is zero because [Q \u2227 N ] \u2208 im \u2202). Now it is clear that [N V \u2227 \u03c7V ] = 0\niff q \u2227 S0 = 0, and D\u2207,V \u2212 \u03c7V is flat iff the normal bundle is flat and D\u03a3 \u2212 q is flat, i.e.,\nm > 3 and \u03a3 is conformally-flat or m = 2 and dq = C \u03a3 . Since\n\u0001\nV\n\u2207,V\nV\n\u2212 d D \u03c7V \u2212 t[N V \u2227 \u03c7V ] ,\nRdt = (1 \u2212 t2 ) RD\nthe equivalence of these conditions with the flatness of dtV is immediate.\n\n\u0003\n\n16.2. General theory and examples. The following observation makes precise the idea\nthat M\u00f6bius-flat submanifolds are those with a enveloped sphere congruence inducing a flat\nM\u00f6bius structure, and leads to many examples of M\u00f6bius-flat submanifolds.\nTheorem 16.4. Let \u03a3 be an m-submanifold of S n with flat weightless normal bundle.\nThen \u03a3 is M\u00f6bius-flat (with CCYP q if m = 2) if and only if* there is an enveloped sphere\ncongruence V (with q = H V (II0 ) if m = 2) such that SV \u2227 IIV + [[id \u2227 QV ]] = 0 (which is\nautomatic for m 6 3) and for some (hence any) Weyl derivative D, we have\n(16.1)\n(16.2)\n\nd D QV + AD,V \u2227 IIV = 0\nV\n1\n2 DK\n\n\u2227 c = AD,V \u2227 IIV\n\n(m = 3),\n(m = 2).\n\nFor m > 3, it then follows that any enveloped sphere congruence satisfies these conditions.\n(*The 'only if ' part holds only away from umbilic points when m = 2.)\nProof. Let V be an enveloped sphere congruence. Then \u03a3 is M\u00f6bius-flat if and only if\nit has flat weightless normal bundle, W \u03a3 = 0 (this equation is vacuous for m 6 3) and\nC \u03a3 = dq for m 6 3. Now W \u03a3 = SV \u2227 IIV + [[id \u2227 QV ]] by the Gauss equation (11.4), so it\nis zero if and only if SV \u2227 IIV + [[id \u2227 QV ]] = 0. When m 6 3, the Gauss equation (11.5)\ninstead gives C \u03a3 = \u2212AD,V \u2227 IIV \u2212 d D QV (with respect to any Weyl derivative D). For\nm = 2 we have QV = \u2212H V (II0 ) \u2212 12 K V c. The result easily follows.\n\u0003\nCorollary 16.5. Channel submanifolds are M\u00f6bius-flat.\nProof. By definition, a channel submanifold admits an enveloped sphere congruence V\nsuch that N V : T \u03a3 \u2192 Hom(V, V \u22a5 ) \u2295 Hom(V \u22a5 , V ) has codimension one kernel. Hence\nSV \u2227 IIV = 0 (so the weightless normal bundle is flat), IIV \u2227 SV = 0 (and so QV = 0 for\nm = 3 and K V = 0 for m = 2) and AD,V \u2227 IIV = 0 for any Weyl derivative D. Hence \u03a3 is\nM\u00f6bius-flat.\n\u0003\nThe gaussian (sectional) curvature of a 2-plane U \u2286 T \u03a3 is defined to be KU =\nhdet IIV |U i. It is a section of \u039b2 . We say that a submanifold of S n has constant gaussian\ncurvature with respect to a compatible metric g on S n if KU = K g for all U and D g K g = 0.\nCorollary 16.6. A submanifold of a spaceform with flat weightless normal bundle and\nconstant gaussian curvature is M\u00f6bius-flat and the induced metric has constant curvature.\nProof. Take V = Vg , the tangent congruence, and D = D g , the induced Weyl derivative,\ng\n= 2 we then have K Vg = K g , hence D g K Vg = 0. More\nso that AVg ,D = 0. For m\nP\ngenerally, Sg \u2227 IIg = \u2212 21 K g i,j \u03b5i \u2227 \u03b5j \u2297 [[\u03b5i , ej ]] with D g K g = 0 where ei is a local frame\nof T \u03a3 \u039b with dual frame \u03b5i . (This can be seen, for instance by viewing both sides as\n\u039b2 -valued quadratic forms on \u22272 (T \u03a3 \u039b).) Therefore for m > 3, QVg = \u2212 21 K g c, hence\ng\nr D ,\u03a3 = r D,Vg \u2212 QVg = ( n1 s g + 21 K g )c. The result easily follows.\n\u0003\nOf course, it is well-known that for m > 3, m-manifolds of constant sectional curvature\nare conformally-flat, so the point of the above Corollary is to take a submanifold point of\nview on this result, via gaussian (sectional) curvature in a spaceform, and extend it to the\ncase m = 2.\n\n\f66\n\nFRANCIS E. BURSTALL AND DAVID M. J. CALDERBANK\n\nIt is also well known that for m > 3, a product of a p-manifold and an (m\u2212p)-manifold of\nconstant sectional curvatures cp and cm\u2212p is conformally flat provided cp + cm\u2212p = 0. Note\nthat the sectional curvature of a 1-manifold is undefined, and a product of a 1-manifold\nand an (m \u2212 1)-manifold of constant sectional curvature is always conformally flat.\nLet us consider the case that this product is an extrinsic product of submanifolds of\nspaceforms inside S n , as in \u00a713.3. As usual we focus on the nondegenerate case S n rS k\u22121 =\nHk \u00d7 S n\u2212k , but the degenerate case is similar. We thus obtain the following submanifold\nanalogue of the m > 3 result, together with an extension to the case m = 2.\nTheorem 16.7. Let \u03a31p \u2192 Hk and \u03a32m\u2212p \u2192 S n\u2212k be immersed submanifolds of spaceforms\n(with 1 6 p 6 k, 1 6 m\u2212p 6 n\u2212k). Then the product embedding \u03a31 \u00d7\u03a32 \u2192 S n is M\u00f6biusflat if and only if \u03a31 and \u03a32 have flat normal bundles and constant gaussian curvatures\nK1 and K2 (the latter condition being automatic on a 1-dimensional manifold) such that\nK1 + K2 = 0 if p > 1 and m \u2212 p > 1.\nProof. Pulling back by the obvious projections we carry out all computations on \u03a3 = \u03a31 \u00d7\n\u03a32 , and let \u03c31 , \u03c32 be the induced maps \u03a3 \u2192 Hk , \u03a3 \u2192 S n\u2212k . Then \u03a3 \u00d7 Rn+1,1 = V \u2295 V \u22a5 ,\nwith V = <\u03c31 , d\u03c31 > \u2295 <\u03c32 , d\u03c32 >, V \u22a5 = V1\u22a5 \u2295 V2\u22a5 (corresponding to the normal bundles\nof \u03a31 and \u03a32 ), and \u039b = <\u03c31 + \u03c32 >. \u039b\u0302 := <\u03c31 \u2212 \u03c32 > is the Weyl structure induced by\nthe product geometry. Clearly DV , N V and \u2207V split across the decomposition of V and\nV \u22a5 . We deduce two things: first, \u2207V is flat if and only if \u03a31 and \u03a32 have flat normal\nbundle; second, V is enveloped by both \u039b and \u039b\u0302, so AD,V = 0 (for the Weyl derivative D\ninduced by \u039b\u0302) and N V = IIV \u2212 SV , with IIV = II1 + II2 being the (direct) sum of the second\nfundamental forms of the factors (and SV similarly). Now\nSV \u2227 IIV = S1 \u2227 II1 + S2 \u2227 II2\n\nand the equation SV \u2227IIV +[[id \u2227QV ]], which is necessary for M\u00f6bius-flatness and determines\nQV for m > 3, implies that m = 2 or QV = f (c1 \u2212 c2 ) for some function f : indeed we first\nobserve that QV must split as Q1 + Q2 , with no cross term, but then we obtain\n[[id \u2227 QV ]] = [[id 1 \u2227 Q1 ]] + [[id 2 \u2227 Q2 ]] + [[id 1 \u2227 Q2 ]] + [[id 2 \u2227 Q1 ]]\nand the last two terms can only cancel with Q1 = f c1 , Q2 = \u2212f c2 . For m > 4, f is\nconstant, while for m = 3, d D QV = 0 if and only if f is constant. By Theorem 16.4, this\ncompletes the proof for m > 3.\nFor m = 2, we write II1 = e21 \u2297 \u03bd1 and II2 = e22 \u2297 \u03bd2 with respect to a weightless\northonormal basis e1 , e2 . Then K V = hdet IIV i = h\u03bd1 , \u03bd2 i = 0, so our product surface is\nalways M\u00f6bius-flat (provided the normal bundles are flat), with CCYP q = H V (II0 ) =\n1 2\n2\n2\n2\n\u0003\n4 (e1 \u2212 e2 ) \u2297 (|\u03bd1 | \u2212 |\u03bd2 | ).\nRemark 16.8. There is a fast way to see that these submanifolds are M\u00f6bius-flat, using\n\u2207,V\nthe equation d\u03c7V = RD : simply take \u03c7V = c(\u03c31 + \u03c32 ) \u25b3 (d\u03c31 \u2212 d\u03c32 ). When m = 2,\n\u2207,V\n= 0. In\nd\u03c7V = 0 (as we have seen, these product manifolds are isothermic) and RD\nV\n\u2227\n\u2227\nhigher dimensions d\u03c7 = cd\u03c31 \u25b3 d\u03c31 \u2212 cd\u03c32 \u25b3 d\u03c32 , and so we take c proportional to the\n\u2207,V\ngaussian curvatures of the factors to get d\u03c7V = RD .\nWe now give a more explicit description of M\u00f6bius-flat submanifolds. For this, recall that\nthe flatness of the weightless normal bundle means that the components of S0 commute,\nand so they are simultaneously diagonalizable. This means we can locally write\nS0 =\n\nm\nX\ni=1\n\n\u03b5i \u2297 ei \u2297 \u03bdi\n\n\fCONFORMAL SUBMANIFOLD GEOMETRY I\u2013III\n\n67\n\nwhere \u03bdi P\nare conormal vectors (whose components are the eigenvalues of the components of\nS0 ) with i \u03bdi = 0, and ei , \u03b5i are dual orthonormal frames of T \u03a3 \u039b and T \u2217\u03a3 L (the ei being\nP\n\u266f\n2\n2 \u2217\n\u223c\nthe eigenvectors of S0 ). (Thus II0 = m\ni=1 \u03b5i \u2297 \u03bdi , using the identification S0 T \u03a3 \u2297 N \u03a3 =\n\u266f\nS02 (T \u2217\u03a3 \u2297 L) \u2297 (\u039b2 N \u03a3), where \u03bd(\u03bdi ) = h\u03bd, \u03bdi i.) When m = 2, q is also diagonalized in\nthis frame, and we write q = \u03bc2 (\u03b521 \u2212 \u03b522 ) with \u03bc a section of \u039b. (Up to reordering we can\nassume \u03bc is real.)\nWe can now extend results of Cartan and Hertrich-Jeromin to arbitrary dimension and\ncodimension for m > 3, and a result of [21] to a much broader context for m = 2.\nTheorem 16.9.

For m > 4 M\u00f6bius-flatness is equivalent to the vanishing of the Weyl curvature\nW \u03a3 , i.e., using\n(11.25), to the equation S0 \u2227 II0 + [[id \u2227 Q]] = 0.

(These conditions are vacuous for m 6 3.) The sum over i (i 6= j) of the left\nhand sides is zero, so it suffices to consider the differences between pairs of equations, i.e.,\nh\u03bdj \u2212 \u03bdk , (m \u2212 2)\u03bdi + \u03bdj + \u03bdk i = 0\nfor all i 6= j, k. Again summing the left hand sides over i (for i 6= j, k) gives zero, so again\nthe equations are equivalent to their differences, which proves the theorem for m > 4.\nFor m = 2, 3, M\u00f6bius-flatness is instead expressed by the equation C \u03a3 = dq. By (11.26),\nthe Cotton\u2013York curvature C \u03a3 = \u2212hB\u2207 (II0 )i is given by a first order quadratic differential\n0 \u2207,D 0\noperator applied to II0 : hB\u2207 (II0 )i = d D Q+hII\n,d\nII i and Q is Cartan's tensor hII0* , II0* i\u2212\n1 0 2\n1P\n\u2212 4 j h\u03bdj , \u03bdj i for 1 6 i 6 m.

Locally\nwe can write \u03b1i = dxi for coordinates xi which form a principal curvature net wherever\nthey are functionally independent, since their differentials are orthogonal with respect to\nboth c and II0 :\nP\nP\n\u22122\n2\n\u22122\n2\nc= m\nII0 = m\ni=1 \u03bbi dxi ,\ni=1 \u03bbi dxi \u2297 \u03bdi .\n\nWhen m = 2, \u03bb21 = h\u03bd, \u03bdi + \u03bc2 and \u03bb22 = h\u03bd, \u03bdi \u2212 \u03bc2 , with \u03bd = \u03bd1 = \u2212\u03bd2 , whereas for m = 3,\n\u03bb21 = h\u03bd12 , \u03bd13 i, \u03bb22 = h\u03bd23 , \u03bd21 i, \u03bb23 = h\u03bd31 , \u03bd32 i, with \u03bdij = \u03bdi \u2212 \u03bdj .\nWe end this paragraph by relating the case m = 2 to Guichard surfaces. Suppose that\nh\u03bd, \u03bdi =\n6 \u03bc2 , and write \u03bd \u266f = \u03bb\u03be for a weightless unit normal \u03be.

By\n\u00b1E1 E2 (\u03ba1 \u2212\u03ba2 ) =\nallowing\nx\nto\nbe\nreal\nor\npure\nimaginary,\nwe\ncan\nreduce\nto\nthe\ncondition\n2\np\n\u00b1(E1 + E2 ). Now, up to reordering of (x1 , x2 ), this is equivalent to its square, which\nyields (\u03ba1 \u2212\u03ba2 )2 = E1\u22121 +E2\u22121 . This is exactly the condition satisfied by metrics of the form\nl\u22122 c in (16.5). The sign of x22 distinguishes between cases known by Calapso as Guichard\nsurfaces of the first and second kind.\n16.3. Conformally-flat hypersurfaces. Conformally-flat hypersurfaces in S m+1 have\nbeen classified (for m > 3 in [36, 54, 55]. From the Theorem 16.9 we can easily reobtain\nthis classification entirely within the realm of (M\u00f6bius) conformal geometry as follows.\nFor m > 4, the equations (\u03bdi \u2212 \u03bdj )(\u03bdk \u2212 \u03bdl ) = 0 force m \u2212 1 of the eigenvalues \u03bdi of II0 to\ncoincide (and conversely, these equations are then satisfied). Therefore \u03a3 has a curvature\nsphere of multiplicity m \u2212 1 > 3 and hence is a channel submanifold by Proposition 13.4.\nFor m = 3 there are two cases. First, if one of the conformal fundamental 1-forms\nvanishes, then two of the \u03bdi coincide and \u03a3 is again a channel submanifold. Otherwise,\ntwo of the conformal fundamental 1-forms are nonzero and real, the third is nonzero\nand\nP\nimaginary (so that x = (x1 , x2 , x3 ) are really coordinates on R2,1 ). Furthermore, i \u03bb\u22122\ni =\n(\u03bd12 \u03bd13 )\u22121 + (\u03bd23 \u03bd21 )\u22121 + (\u03bd31 \u03bd32 )\u22121 = 0 (multiply by \u03bd12 \u03bd23 \u03bd31 ), so that the principal\ncurvature net satisfies a condition studied by Guichard: the sum of the squares of its Lam\u00e9\nfunctions is zero. Conversely, if the principal curvature net is Guichard, with the \u03bdi given\n\n\fCONFORMAL SUBMANIFOLD GEOMETRY I\u2013III\n\n69\n\nby 3\u03bd1 = \u03bb1 \u03bb2 /\u03bb3 \u2212 \u03bb1 \u03bb3 /\u03bb2 and cyclic permutations thereof, then the Guichard condition\nensures that the conformal fundamental forms are the dxi , so that \u03a3 is conformally-flat.\nFor m = 2, there are again two cases: if \u03bc2 = h\u03bd, \u03bdi then q = \u03bd(II0 ) and V = V\u03a3 + \u03bd is\na sphere congruence with K V = 0 which induces the given flat M\u00f6bius structure, so that\nIIV is degenerate. It follows from Theorem 16.4 that AD,V \u2227 IIV = 0 and hence \u03a3 is a\nchannel submanifold enveloping the sphere-curve defined by V . Otherwise, as we saw in\nthe previous paragraph, \u03a3 is a Guichard surface of the first or second kind (given by (16.5))\naccording to whether \u03bc2 > h\u03bd, \u03bdi or \u03bc2 < h\u03bd, \u03bdi.\n\u2022 When m > 4, a conformally-flat hypersurface in S m+1 is a channel submanifold, i.e.,\nm \u2212 1 of the eigenvalues of II0 coincide.\n\u2022 When m = 3, a conformally-flat hypersurface in S 4 is a either a channel submanifold or\nis Guichard isothermic in the sense that the principal curvature net is a Guichard net.\n\u2022 When m = 2, a M\u00f6bius-flat surface in S 3 is either a channel surface or is a Guichard\nsurface as described by Calapso [23].\nWe have a little more to say on the cases m = 3 and m = 2.\nGuichard nets and the Gauss\u2013Codazzi\u2013Ricci equations. In [56], Hertrich-Jeromin observes\nthat any Guichard net arises from a conformally flat hypersurface in S 4 . We have already\nseen that Guichard nets provide solutions to the Gauss equation for such conformally-flat\nhypersurfaces, so it remains to verify the Codazzi equation. We then apply the conformal\nBonnet theorem, thus bypassing some of the computations in [56].\nConsider a Guichard net with coordinates (x1 , x2 , x3 ) and Lam\u00e9 functions 1/\u03bbi , as in the\nprevious paragraph.\nDefine (\u03bd1 , \u03bd2 , \u03bd3 ) by 3\u03bd1 = \u03bb1 \u03bb2 /\u03bb3 \u2212\u03bb1 \u03bb3 /\u03bb2 and cyclic permutations\nP\nand set II0 = i (dxi /\u03bbi ) \u2297 \u03bdi (dxi /\u03bbi ). To verify the Codazzi equation, we need to show\nthatP\nd D II0 = \u03b1 \u2227 g for some 1-form \u03b1, where D is the Levi-Civita connection of the metric\ng = i (dxi /\u03bbi )2 .\nWe compute\nP D via Cartan's method using the orthonormal frame \u03c9i = dxi /\u03bbi and find\nthat D\u03c9i = j Aij \u2297 \u03c9j with Aij = \u2212(\u2202i \u03bbj )\u03c9j /\u03bbj + (\u2202j \u03bbi )\u03c9i /\u03bbi (and \u2202i is shorthand for\nP\n\u2202/\u2202xi ): we just need to check that Aij = \u2212Aji and d\u03c9i = j Aij \u2227 \u03c9j . Then\nX\nD\u03c9i \u2227 (\u03bdi \u03c9i ) + \u03c9i \u2297 d\u03bdi \u2227 \u03c9i + \u03c9i \u2297 (\u03bdi d\u03c9i )\nd D II0 =\ni\n\n=\n\nX\ni,j\n\n=\n\nX\ni\n\n\u03c9j \u2297 Aij \u2227 (\u03bdi \u03c9i ) + \u03c9i \u2297 (\u2202j \u03bdi )\u03c9j \u2227 \u03c9i + \u03c9i \u2297 \u03bdi Aij \u2227 \u03c9j\n\n\u0001\n\u03c9i \u2297 (\u2202j \u03bdi )\u03c9j \u2212 (\u03bb\u22121\ni \u2202j \u03bbi )(\u03bdi \u2212 \u03bdj )\u03c9j \u2227 \u03c9i ,\n\nwhere the last line follows by relabelling the indices in the first term and substituting for Aij .\nWe thus need the term in brackets to be independent of i (modulo \u03c9i ). It is straightforward\nto verify the three conditions this entails, once one appreciates the following identity for\nthe quantities entering into the definition of the \u03bd's:\n\u0010 d\u03bb\n\u0010\u03bb \u03bb \u0011\nd\u03bbk \u0011\nj\nj k\n+\n= \u2212\u03bbi\nd\n\u03bbi\n\u03bbk\n\u03bbj\nP\nfor i, j, k distinct. This in turn is an easy consequence of the Guichard condition i \u03bb\u22122\ni =\n0. Hence the Codazzi equation holds, and the data ([g], II0 ) define a local conformally-flat\nimmersion into S 4 .\nStrictly M\u00f6bius-flat surfaces and Dupin cyclides. We turn now to M\u00f6bius-flat surfaces with\nCCYP q = 0: in this case, or more generally when q is divergence-free (i.e., q 2,0 is holomorphic), the conformal M\u00f6bius structure induced by the central sphere congruence is flat,\n\n\f70\n\nFRANCIS E. BURSTALL AND DAVID M. J. CALDERBANK\n\nand we shall say \u03a3 is strictly M\u00f6bius-flat. We obtain the M\u00f6bius structure by setting\n\u03bc = 0 in (16.5) (we may use this formula away from umbilic points). However, it follows\nfrom these formulae that any strictly M\u00f6bius-flat surface carries a nonzero holomorphic\nquadratic differential commuting with II0 , namely \u03bb2 S, and hence is also an isothermic\nsurface. Also g = \u03bb2 c is flat, so these surfaces are very special. We now show that they are\nin fact Dupin cyclides. Although this result is presented in [21], we discuss it in more detail\nhere to show how the properties of Dupin cyclides can be seen explicitly in this setting.\nProposition 16.11. Away from umbilic points, a strictly M\u00f6bius-flat surface \u03a3 in the\nconformal 3-sphere has conformal metric and tracefree second fundamental form given by\nequation (16.5) with \u03bc = 0 (for some coordinates x1 , x2 , a weightless unit normal \u03be and a\ngauge \u03bb), and the M\u00f6bius structure given by\nH = sym0 (D g )2 + 2t (dx1 2 \u2212 dx2 2 )\n\nfor a constant t \u2208 R, D g being the Levi-Civita connection of the flat metric g = \u03bb2 c.\nFurthermore, \u03a3 is isothermic with holomorphic quadratic differential q0 = dx1 2 \u2212 dx2 2 ,\nand is Willmore iff t = 0.\nProof. We have already obtained the formulae for c and II0 and the conformal M\u00f6bius\nstructure is determined by H = sym0 (D g )2 + q\u0303 for some quadratic differential q\u0303. However,\nboth H and sym0 (D g )2 are flat, so q\u0303 2,0 must be holomorphic, and the Codazzi equation\ngives 0 = (H\u2207 )\u2217 (JII0 ) = hq\u0303, JII0 i, so that q\u0303 commutes with II0 , and is therefore a constant\nmultiple of q0 = dx1 2 \u2212 dx2 2 . Since q0 is holomorphic and commutes with II0 , the surface\n\u0003\nis isothermic. It is Willmore iff 0 = (H\u2207 )\u2217 II0 = h 2t q\u0303, II0 i, i.e., t = 0.\nSince the vector fields \u2202/\u2202x1 and \u2202/\u2202x2 leave the Gauss\u2013Codazzi\u2013Ricci data invariant,\nthey induce symmetries of the surface. More precisely, with respect to the decomposition\n\u03a3 \u00d7 R4,1 = \u039b \u2295 Ug \u2295 \u039b\u0302g \u2295 <\u03be>, where Ug is orthogonal to \u039b \u2295 \u039b\u0302g \u2295 <\u03be>, we have\n(16.6)\n\nd = id + D g + \u2207 + II0 \u2212 S0 +\n\n2\n1+t\n2 dx1\n\n+\n\n2\n1\u2212t\n2 dx2 ,\n\n(which, incidently, shows that \u039b\u0302g is immersed unless |t| = 1; furthermore, it is also strictly\nM\u00f6bius-flat). Here we have use the fact that the Weyl structure \u039b\u0302g induced by g is the secg\nond envelope of the central sphere congruence (since Ag = \u2212 div \u2207,D II0 = 0).

Thus we have two elements of so(4, 1) which\ncommute and induce vector fields on S 3 (their homology classes) which are tangent to \u03a3.\nIt follows that \u03a3 is an open subset of a Dupin cyclide, cf. \u00a713.3. Furthermore \u03b81 and \u03b82 are\nthe decomposable vectors in their span: identifying so(n + 1, 1) with \u22272 Rn+1,1 , we have\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u03b82 =\n\u03bb\u22121 , \u03be, t\u22121\n\u03b81 = \u2212\u03bb\u22121 , \u03be, t+1\n2 \u03bb \u2227 (0, \u2212\u03bb dx1 , 0),\n2 \u03bb \u2227 (0, \u03bb dx2 , 0).\n\nThe two planes defined by these decomposables are both spacelike for |t| < 2, while for\n|t| = 2 one is spacelike, the other degenerate, and for |t| > 2 one is spacelike, the other\nhas signature (1, 1). Accordingly, \u03a3 is (M\u00f6bius equivalent to) an open subset of a circular\ntorus of revolution, a cylinder of revolution, or a cone of revolution.\nThus strictly M\u00f6bius-flat surfaces in S 3 form a very restricted class, in contrast to the\n3-dimensional case, where there is a rich supply of conformally flat hypersurface in S 4 from\ncones, cylinders or revolutes over surfaces of constant gaussian curvature in S 3 , R3 or H3\nrespectively. This was one of our motivations for broadening the notion of M\u00f6bius-flat\nsurface: the broader class includes arbitrary cones, cylinders, or revolutes.\n\n\fCONFORMAL SUBMANIFOLD GEOMETRY I\u2013III\n\n71\n\nPreview of Part V\nThe machinery of this paper reduces the theory of conformal immersions to its homological essence, and we have seen the efficiency of this in some applications. Nevertheless,\nit is often more expedient to work with the bundle formalism of sphere congruences, which\nwe develop further in Part IV. One reason for this is simplicity: the calculus of bundles\nand connections is more straightforward and familiar than that of BGG operators. Another\nreason is that the homological approach emphasises the central sphere congruence, whereas\nother enveloped sphere congruences my be better adapted to the problem at hand.\nIn Part V of our conformal submanifold geometry project, we return to (constrained)\nWillmore surfaces, isothermic surfaces and M\u00f6bius-flat submanifolds to study their transformation theory. For this, sphere congruences take centre stage, with the homological viewpoint as a backdrop. In particular, we relate Ribaucour sphere congruences and B\u00e4cklund\ntransformations of curved flats to Darboux and Eisenhart transformations of isothermic\nsurfaces and M\u00f6bius-flat submanifolds respectively. In the isothermic case, these links are\nwell-known, but they are less well understood for M\u00f6bius-flat submanifolds.\nM\u00f6bius-flat submanifolds arise as orthogonal submanifolds to flat spherical systems and\nhave a rich transformation theory, generalizing the transformations of Guichard surfaces,\ndeveloped by C. Guichard [49], P. Calapso [23] and L. Eisenhart [42] in dimension two\nand codimension one. In dimension 3 or more and codimension one, conformally flat\nhypersurfaces were known to be related to flat cyclic systems [55]. We provide a uniform\ntheory in arbitrary dimension and codimension, both of transformations of M\u00f6bius-flat\nsubmanifolds, and of the relation with curved flat spherical systems, providing further\njustification for the definition given in this part.\nWe also apply the notion of polynomial conserved quantities to isothermic surfaces\nand M\u00f6bius-flat submanifolds. The former application has been developed extensively\nin [22, 67]-in particular affine conserved quantities provide a conformal approach to constant mean curvature surfaces in arbitrary spaceforms (by regarding them as isothermic\nsurfaces). Similarly, affine conserved quantities for M\u00f6bius-flat submanifolds provide a\nconformal approach to constant gaussian curvature submanifolds in arbitrary spaceforms\n(cf. [42]).\nReferences\n[1] M. A. Akivis, On the conformal differential geometry of multidimensional surfaces, Mat. Sb. 53 (1961)\n53\u201372.\n[2] M. A. Akivis and V. V.
