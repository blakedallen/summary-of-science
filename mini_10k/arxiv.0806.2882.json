INTRODUCTION\n\nMost of the satellites of the four giant planets in the solar\nsystem can be divided into two groups, usually called the regular and irregular satellites. Regular satellites orbit close to\nthe planet (within \u223c 0.05rH , where rH is the Hill radius1 ), and\nmove on nearly circular, prograde orbits that lie close to the\nplanetary equator. Irregular satellites are found at distances\n\u223c 0.05rH \u2212 0.6rH , with large orbital eccentricities and inclinations, on both prograde and retrograde orbits. An alternative division between regular and irregular satellites is given\nby the critical semi-major axis (e.g., Goldreich 1966; Burns\n1986), acrit = (2\u03bcJ2 R2 a3p )1/5 ; those with a > acrit are classified\nas irregular satellites. Here J2 is the planet's second zonal harmonic coefficient (augmented by any contribution from the inner regular satellites) and R is the planet's radius. This critical\nradius marks the location where the precession of the satellite's orbital plane is dominated by the Sun rather than by the\nplanet's oblateness. The current number ratios of irregular to\nregular satellites are 55/8 for Jupiter, 35/21 for Saturn, 9/18\nfor Uranus, and 7/6 for Neptune (e.g., Jewitt & Haghighipour\n2007). The regular satellites are likely to have formed within\na circumplanetary disk of gas and solid bodies. The kinematic differences between regular and irregular satellites suggest that the latter must have formed through a quite different\nmechanism, most likely capture from the circumstellar disk\n(for a recent review, see Jewitt & Haghighipour 2007).\nThe search for irregular satellites of the giant planets has\nbeen fruitful in recent years, owing mainly to modern highsensitivity, large-scale CCDs (e.g., Gladman et al. 1998, 2000,\n2001; Holman et al. 2004; Kavelaars et al. 2004; Sheppard\n& Jewitt 2003; Sheppard et al. 2005, 2006). Up to 2007,\n106 irregular satellites of the giant planets had been discov1 The Hill radius is defined as r = a (\u03bc/3)1/3 , where a is the semi-major\np\np\nH\naxis of the planet orbit and \u03bc \u2261 m p /(m p + M\u2299 ) with m p the planet mass.\n\nered, compared to 53 regular satellites. Two features stand\nout in the distributions of orbital parameters of these irregular satellites. First, retrograde irregular satellites extend to\nlarger semi-major axes than prograde ones (\u223c 0.6rH compared\nto \u223c 0.4rH ); second, satellites with orbital inclination in the\nrange \u223c 60\u25e6 \u2212 130\u25e6 relative to the ecliptic are absent.\nA number of authors have shown that these features can be\nexplained reasonably well by the requirement that the satellite\norbits be stable. H\u00e9non (1969, 1970) studied the planar circular restricted three-body problem in Hill's (1886) approximation, where the mass ratio \u03bc \u2192 0 while the radii of interest\nshrink to zero as \u03bc1/3 . He showed that prograde satellite orbits are stable up to a mean distance from the planet \u223c 0.4rH ,\nwhile retrograde satellite orbits can be stable at much larger\ndistances from the planet. Thus it is not surprising that retrograde satellites are found at larger distances than prograde\nones. Hamilton & Krivov (1997) studied the dynamics of\ndistant satellites of asteroids in heliocentric orbits using a\n\"generalized Tisserand constant\" and, among other conclusions, confirmed that retrograde orbits are more stable than\nprograde ones. Carruba et al. (2002) used a combination of\nanalytic arguments and numerical integrations to show that\nhigh-inclination orbits inside the Hill sphere exhibit large eccentricity oscillations (Kozai oscillations; Kozai 1962) due to\nsecular solar perturbations. They found that orbits with inclinations (relative to the planetary orbital plane) between 55\u25e6\nand 130\u25e6 are generally unstable, thus explaining the absence\nof irregular satellites on high-inclination orbits. Nesvorn\u00fd et\nal. (2003) performed detailed orbital integrations of the four\ngiant planets plus a grid of test-particle satellites for intervals\nof 106 \u2013108 yr. They confirmed that retrograde satellites can\nbe stable at larger radii than prograde ones, and that highly inclined orbits are unstable. They argued that the largest semimajor axes at which satellites of the four giant planets could\nsurvive for times comparable to the lifetime of the solar sys-\n\n\f2\n\nSHEN & TREMAINE\n\ntem were \u223c 0.7rH for retrograde satellites and \u223c 0.4rH for\nprograde ones, and that these upper limits were achieved only\nfor nearly circular orbits close to the plane of the ecliptic.\nOther authors have examined the possibility that stable\nsatellite orbits exist with mean distance from the planet & rH .\nIn the planetocentric frame, the dominant force on such satellites is due to the Sun, rather than the planet2 . Nevertheless, the satellite remains close to the planet because it is in\na 1:1 resonance in the sense that its heliocentric mean longitude librates around that of the planet; the resulting orbit\nrelative to the planet is a retrograde ellipse with axis ratio\n2:1, the short axis pointing towards the Sun, and synodic period equal to the planet's orbital period. The analytical theory of such orbits is described by Jackson (1913), Lidov &\nVashkov'yak (1994a,b), Mikkola & Innanen (1997), Namouni\n(1999), Mikkola et al. (2006), and others. H\u00e9non's (1970) numerical analysis of Hill's approximation to the planar circular\nrestricted three-body problem suggests that stable retrograde\nsatellites can exist at arbitrarily large distance from the planet.\nBenest (1971) confirmed that stable retrograde orbits at large\ndistances persist in the elliptic restricted three-body problem,\nwhere the mass ratio and eccentricity were chosen to match\nthose of Jupiter. Wiegert et al. (2000) demonstrated that retrograde satellites of Uranus and Neptune could be stable for\nup to 109 yr at distances up to \u223c 10rH , suggesting that primordial objects of this type could still exist in the solar system\nalthough none are currently known.\nDespite the number and quality of these investigations,\nthere are several unanswered questions that lead us to revisit\nthe problem of orbital stability of satellites at large distances\nfrom the host planet. (i) Wiegert et al. (2000) found stable\nsatellite orbits beyond the Hill radius only for Uranus and\nNeptune, not Jupiter or Saturn. What is the reason for this\ndifference? The possibilities include differences in the planetary masses and orbital eccentricities, or different perturbations from neighboring planets. (ii) Wiegert et al. (2000) explored orbits outside the Hill radius, while Nesvorn\u00fd et al.\n(2003) explored orbits inside the Hill radius (indeed, in the\nformer paper the integrations were terminated when the particles entered the Hill sphere of radius rH around the planet,\nwhile in the latter paper the integrations were terminated when\nthe particles exited the Hill sphere). Are there stable satellite\norbits that cross the Hill sphere? (iii) As we shall describe\nfurther in \u00a72, the grids of initial conditions used by Nesvorn\u00fd\net al. and Wiegert et al. do not provide a complete exploration\nof the phase space in which stable satellite orbits exist.\nThe primary goal of this paper is to map out the entire stability region in phase space-both inside and outside the Hill\nsphere-in which satellite orbits that can survive around the\nfour giant planets for times comparable to the age of the solar system (our main integrations last for up to 100 Myr). We\ndescribe our setup in \u00a72, and present the results in \u00a73. We\nconclude and discuss our results in \u00a74.\nFollowing Fabrycky (2008), we shall define a \"satellite\" of\na planet to be a small body whose distance from the planet\nnever exceeds the semi-major axis of the planet, a p . This definition excludes bodies on Trojan orbits around the triangular Lagrange points, bodies on horseshoe orbits, and objects\nsuch as asteroid 2003 YN107 (Connors et al. 2004), which\noscillates between a horseshoe orbit and an orbit centered on\nEarth. This definition seems simple and reasonable to us, but\n2 Hence these are sometimes called \"quasi-satellites\" (Lidov &\nVashkov'yak 1994a,b; Mikkola & Innanen 1997).\n\nother definitions are common in the literature. Many authors\ndefine \"satellite\" to be an object that always remains within\nthe Hill sphere of the planet or whose Jacobi constant constrains it to remain within the last closed zero-velocity surface around the planet. Benest (1971) defines a satellite to\nbe a body whose heliocentric orbital frequency is the same as\nthe planet's, but whose synodic frequency around the planet\nis non-zero. Wiegert et al. use the term \"quasi-satellite\" for\nan object that remains outside the Hill sphere but whose heliocentric longitude difference from the planet never exceeds\n120\u25e6 and regularly passes through zero. However, the term\n\"quasi-satellite\" is confusing because it is also used for objects such as 2003 YN107 that spend part of their time on\nhorseshoe orbits and thus are only temporarily satellites in\nour sense.\n2. METHODS\n\nAlthough all of our results are based on direct numerical\nintegrations of the N-body problem (Sun, one or four giant\nplanets, plus a test particle orbiting one planet), we shall find\nit useful to interpret our results in terms of the coordinates and\nnotation used by H\u00e9non (1970) in the exploration of satellite\norbits in Hill's approximation.\n2.1. Hill's approximation\n\nWhen studying satellite motions near a planet (r \u226a rH ) it\nis conventional to employ a non-rotating planetocentric coordinate system, which we denote as (xyz). However, in Hill's\napproximation to the circular restricted three-body problem,\nit is more convenient to use a rotating planetocentric coordinate system (\u03be\u03b7\u03b6), where \u03be, \u03b7 and \u03b6 are scaled coordinates\nin the rotating frame in which the planet is at the origin, the\n\u03be axis is along the direction opposite the Sun and the \u03b6 axis\nis perpendicular to the Sun-planet orbital plane. In Hill's formulation the unit of length is \u03bc1/3 a p , and the unit of time is\nn\u22121 where n \u2261 [G(M\u2299 + m p )/a3p ]1/2 is the mean motion of the\nplanet. As usual, the orbit of the planet in the inertial frame\nis counter-clockwise as viewed from the positive z or \u03b6 axis.\nIn Hill's coordinate system the collinear Lagrangian points L1\nand L2 are located at \u03b7 = \u03b6 = 0, \u03be = \u00b13\u22121/3 \u2243 0.6934, and the\nHill radius is rH = 3\u22121/3 . Similar definitions are used in this\npaper when the planet orbit is eccentric and/or perturbed by\nother planets; in this case the \u03be axis points away from the instantaneous position of the Sun, the \u03b6 axis is perpendicular to\nthe instantaneous orbital plane of the planet around the Sun,\nand a p is the initial semi-major axis of the planet.\nIn the circular restricted three-body problem, Hill's approximation is achieved by taking the limit \u03bc \u2192 0, where the equations of motion reduce to (e.g., H\u00e9non 1974; Murray & Dermott 1999):\n\u03b7\n\u03be\n\u03be\u0308 = 2\u03b7\u0307 + 3\u03be \u2212 2 2 2 3/2 , \u03b7\u0308 = \u22122\u03be\u0307 \u2212 2 2 2 3/2 ,\n(\u03be + \u03b7 + \u03b6 )\n(\u03be + \u03b7 + \u03b6 )\n\u03b6\n(1)\n\u03b6\u0308 = \u2212\u03b6 \u2212 2 2 2 3/2 .\n(\u03be + \u03b7 + \u03b6 )\nThere exists an integral of motion for these equations,\n2\n(2)\n\u0393 = 3\u03be 2 + 2 2 2 1/2 \u2212 \u03b6 2 \u2212 (\u03be\u0307 2 + \u03b7\u0307 2 + \u03b6\u0307 2 ) ,\n(\u03be + \u03b7 + \u03b6 )\nwhich corresponds to the Jacobi constant in the circular restricted three-body problem.\nFor the moment let us restrict ourselves to motion in the\nSun-planet orbital plane, so \u03b6 = \u03b6\u0307 = 0 at all times.

The Lagrange points L1 and L2 are marked by\n\u2217. The horizontal dashed line at \u03be = 0 separates retrograde orbits from prograde ones (as defined in the rotating planetocentric frame). Left: The region shaded\nby vertical lines is an approximate reproduction of the stable region as estimated in H\u00e9non (1970). The dotted region is where the osculating Kepler elements\ncorrespond to bound elliptical orbits (a > 0, e < 1). Right: Curved lines represent the initial conditions derived using osculating elements in the high-resolution\nsurvey of Nesvorn\u00fd et al. (2003), color-coded according to eccentricity. Solid and long-dashed lines represent orbits which are prograde and retrograde in\nthe non-rotating planetocentric frame respectively. There are two sets of lines for each eccentricity corresponding to argument of pericenter \u03c9 = 0\u25e6 and 180\u25e6\nrespectively. The short segments at the lower right below L1 are extensions of the e = 0.50 and 0.75 branches which are prograde in the non-rotating frame. Thus\norbits that are retrograde in the rotating frame can be prograde in the non-rotating frame. The initial conditions for zero-inclination orbits sampled by Wiegert et\nal. (2000) are shown as filled circles for Uranus and open circles for Jupiter.\n\nstudy orbital motions we may use a surface of section defined by \u03b7 = 0, \u03b7\u0307 > 0. The trajectory in the four-dimensional\n(\u03be, \u03b7, \u03be\u0307, \u03b7\u0307) phase space is then represented by a set of points in\nthe (\u03be, \u03be\u0307) plane, and for a given value of the Jacobi constant \u0393\nthe other two phase-space coordinates can be derived from\n\u0012\n\u00131/2\n2\n2\n2\n\u03b7 = 0,\n\u03b7\u0307 = 3\u03be \u2212 \u03be\u0307 +\n\u2212\u0393\n.\n(3)\n|\u03be|\nWe define \"prograde\" and \"retrograde\" in the rotating frame\nunless otherwise noted. Thus retrograde orbits have \u03be < 0 in\nthis surface of section and prograde orbits have \u03be > 0.\nA drawback of this surface of section is that a different plot\nis needed for each value of the Jacobi constant \u0393. To obtain a\nglobal view of the dynamics, we use a different surface of section defined by \u03b7 = 0, \u03be\u0307 = 0, \u03b7\u0307 = (3\u03be 2 + 2/|\u03be| \u2212 \u0393)1/2. A trajectory is represented by a point in the (\u0393, \u03be) plane. This surface\nof section was introduced by H\u00e9non (1969; 1970), and we\nshall call it the H\u00e9non surface of section or H\u00e9non diagram.\nThe H\u00e9non diagram, like any surface of section, will not show\norbits that do not cross it; the usefulness of the H\u00e9non diagram\nderives from the observation that most stable orbits periodically pass close to the point \u03b7 = \u03be\u0307 = 0-for example, this occurs for nearly Keplerian orbits close to the planet when their\nline of apsides precesses past the Sun-planet line. The orbits\nnot shown on the H\u00e9non diagram include those confined to\nsome resonant islands, which should occupy a small fraction\nof phase space, and escape orbits, which we are not interested\nin anyway.\nFig. 1 (left panel) is a H\u00e9non diagram modeled on Figure 12 of H\u00e9non (1970). The Lagrange points are at (\u0393, \u03be) =\n(34/3 , \u00b13\u22121/3 ) = (4.32675, \u00b10.69336). Forbidden regions, in\nwhich \u03b7\u0307 2 = 3\u03be 2 + 2/|\u03be| \u2212 \u0393 would be negative, are shaded in\ngray. The stable regions of phase space, as estimated by\n\nH\u00e9non, are denoted by vertical stripes. The diagram shows\nthat retrograde satellites (\u03be < 0) have a larger stable region\nthan prograde satellites (\u03be > 0), a conclusion consistent with\nthe numerical studies described in \u00a71. Moreover, the stable\nband in this diagram that begins at (\u0393, \u03be) = (\u22121.4, \u22121.2) and\nstretches downward to the left shows that retrograde satellites\ncan be stable at distances much larger than the Hill radius; in\nfact, this band continues to arbitrarily large negative values of\n\u0393 and \u03be (see Figure 13 of H\u00e9non 1970), so retrograde satellites\ncan be stable at arbitrarily large distances from the planet, at\nleast in Hill's approximation to the planar circular restricted\nthree-body problem.\nIn future discussions we divide the stable regions in Fig. 1\ninto three branches: the inner prograde branch (\u03be > 0), the\ninner retrograde branch (\u03be < 0 and \u0393 > 0), and the outer retrograde branch (\u03be < 0 and \u0393 < 0).\nA simple and rather complete way to sample initial conditions in the planar three-body problem is to use the H\u00e9non\ndiagram, i.e., to sample uniformly in the (\u0393, \u03be) plane. As described above, this approach is based on the assumption that\nmost stable orbits periodically have their apocenter or pericenter on the Sun-planet line. Note that even without invoking Hill's approximation the question of which initial conditions on the H\u00e9non diagram correspond to stable orbits is\nwell-posed. Accordingly, we may present our stability results\nin terms of the H\u00e9non diagrams, even though our orbit integrations do not use Hill's approximation.\nWe may compare this approach to the grids of initial conditions used in other investigations of the stability of satellite orbits. The initial conditions for Nesvorn\u00fd et al.'s \"highresolution survey\" were chosen from a grid of planet-centered\nosculating Keplerian orbital elements, with semi-major axis\na given typically by a/rH = 0.1\u20131, eccentricity e = 0\u20130.75,\ninclination i = 0\u25e6 \u2013180\u25e6, argument of pericenter \u03c9 = 0\u25e6 , 90\u25e6 ,\n\n\f4\n\nSHEN & TREMAINE\n\nand the other elements distributed uniformly between 0\u25e6 and\n360\u25e6 . The right panel of Fig. 1 shows similar initial conditions on the H\u00e9non diagram (i = 0\u25e6 or 180\u25e6 and \u03c9 = 0\u25e6 or\n180\u25e6 ). The conversions from osculating elements to (\u0393, \u03be)\nwere done using equations (8) and (10) in H\u00e9non (1970). It\nis clear that the initial conditions sampled in Nesvorn\u00fd et al.\ndo not provide a complete exploration of the phase space in\nwhich stable satellite orbits could exist; in particular, they\ncompletely missed the stable region that extends beyond the\nHill sphere (of course, such orbits are also excluded from their\nstudy by their artificially imposed escape criterion r > rH ). In\nfact, most of the stable orbits beyond the Hill sphere have hyperbolic osculating elements. In Fig. 1 we plot the boundaries\nthat separate regions of hyperbolic osculating elements from\nthose with elliptical osculating elements, where the latter are\nshaded by a dotted pattern. The functional forms of these\nboundaries are:\n\u0393 = 2\u03be 2 \u2212 23/2 |\u03be|1/2 ,\n\u0393 = 2\u03be + 2\n\n3/2\n\n\u0393 = 2\u03be + 2\n\n3/2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n|\u03be|\n\n1/2\n\n|\u03be|\n\n1/2\n\n(\u03be < 0) ,\n\n(4)\n\n,\n\n(0 \u2264 \u03be \u2264 2\n\n,\n\n(\u03be < \u22122\n\n1/3\n\n1/3\n\n).\n\n),\n\n(5)\n(6)\n\nThe initial conditions explored by Wiegert et al. (2000)\nwere chosen from a grid of heliocentric osculating Keplerian\nelements, these being the same as the elements of the host\nplanets except for the eccentricity and inclination. The eccentricity was typically chosen in the range e = 0\u20130.5 and\ninclination in the range 0\u25e6 \u201330\u25e6 . With this procedure, zeroinclination orbits appear in the H\u00e9non diagram along the locus\n\u0393 = 2/|\u03be| \u2212 \u03be 2\nwith\n\u03be = \u2212e\u03bc\u22121/3 ,\n(7)\nwhere the expression for \u0393 is evaluated using Hill's approximation. The grid sampled by Wiegert et al. for i = 0 is also\nshown in the right panel of Fig. 1, converted from the heliocentric frame using Hill's units (but without Hill's approximation); for clarity, only Jupiter and Uranus are shown. Although Wiegert et al.'s initial conditions do probe the stability\nregion found by H\u00e9non beyond the Hill sphere, the coverage\nis far from complete.\nTo extend our study to three-dimensional orbital motions\nwe use a surface of section at \u03b7 = \u03b6 = \u03be\u0307 = 0, \u03b7\u0307 > 0. In the\nrotating frame, we define the initial inclination angle I by\ntan I =\n\n\u03b6\u0307\n\u03b7\u0307\n\n,\n\n(8)\n\nt=0\n\nsuch that the initial \u03b7 and \u03b6 component velocities are\n\u00131/2\n\u00131/2\n\u0012\n\u0012\n2\n2\n, \u03b6\u0307 = sin I 3\u03be 2 + \u2212 \u0393\n. (9)\n\u03b7\u0307 = cos I 3\u03be 2 + \u2212 \u0393\n|\u03be|\n|\u03be|\nSince \u03b7\u0307 > 0, the inclination is restricted to the range \u221290\u25e6 <\nI < 90\u25e6 .\nTherefore each point in the (\u0393, \u03be) plane represents a unique\nset of initial conditions for a given inclination. The usefulness\nof the H\u00e9non diagram in this case is based on the assumption\nthat most stable orbits periodically have their line of apsides\nand their line of nodes simultaneously on the Sun-planet line.\nThis assumption is not always valid: it requires that the argument of pericenter \u03c9 is periodically 0 or \u03c0, while a satellite\ntrapped in the Kozai resonance has an argument of pericenter that librates around 12 \u03c0 or 32 \u03c0 (Kozai 1962; Carruba et al.\n2002). We estimate the incompleteness in our survey due to\nsuch orbits in \u00a73.2.\n\nBecause the equations of motion are symmetric around the\n\u03b6 = 0 plane, we may further restrict the inclination to the range\n0\u25e6 \u2264 I < 90\u25e6 . As in the two-dimensional case, we define \"prograde\" and \"retrograde\" in the rotating frame unless otherwise\nnoted. Thus retrograde orbits have \u03be < 0 and prograde orbits\nhave \u03be > 0 at this surface of section \u03b7 = \u03b6 = \u03be\u0307 = 0, \u03b7\u0307 > 0.\n2.2. Numerical orbit integrations\n\nEven in the two-dimensional case, we expect that the stable regions for distant satellites of the giant planets will be\nsomewhat different from those derived by H\u00e9non (1970) and\nshown in Fig. 1, since (i) H\u00e9non's results are based on Hill's\napproximation \u03bc \u2192 0, while the giant planets have \u03bc in the\nrange 0.00096 (Jupiter) to 0.000044 (Uranus); (ii) H\u00e9non's\nresults assume that the planet orbit is circular, while the giant planets have eccentricities between 0.0086 and 0.056; (iii)\nboth the satellites and their host planets are subject to perturbations from the other planets. We must carry out long-term\nnumerical integrations of the satellite orbits to assess the influence of these effects on the stability region shown in Fig.\n1.\nWe sample the initial conditions using a fine grid on the\nH\u00e9non diagram, with d\u0393 = 0.1 and d\u03be = 0.06. This is shown\nas the dotted grid in Fig. 2. We then convert them to the nonrotating (xyz) planetocentric coordinate system where we do\nthe integrations of satellite orbits. We require that in the rotating frame the Sun is always located at the \u2212\u03be axis, and the\nangular velocity of the rotating frame equals the instantaneous\nangular velocity of the Sun relative to the planet in the nonrotating planetocentric frame; thus the angular speed of the\nrotating frame is time-varying if the planet's orbit is eccentric, and the direction of the \u03b6 axis may vary if the planet's\norbit is perturbed by other planets. We use a unit of length\n\u03bc1/3 a p and unit of time n\u22121 to scale the coordinates/velocities\nbetween the two frames, where a p is taken to be the initial\nsemi-major axis of the planet.\nThe system to be numerically integrated is composed of\nthe four outer giant planets (or sometimes just one of them),\nthe Sun, and a satellite around one of the planets; the satellite is treated as a massless test particle. We use a secondorder Wisdom-Holman symplectic scheme (Wisdom & Holman 1991), as implemented in the Swift package (Levison &\nDuncan 1994). Following Nesvorn\u00fd et al. (2003), we have\nmodified the Swift code such that the integration of the planets is done in the Jacobi coordinate system while that of the\nsatellites is done in the non-rotating planetocentric coordinate system. We tried different timesteps to optimize between\nspeed and accuracy, and found dt = 20 days is short enough\nto produce the correct results with reasonable computational\ncost, for all four planets.\nOne potential concern is that the Wisdom-Holman symplectic scheme, as we have implemented it, is designed for\nnearly Keplerian orbits relative to the planet and might break\ndown at large distances from the planet, where the orbits are\nnearly Keplerian relative to the Sun. However, the characteristic orbital period at large distances is equal to the planetary\norbital period, and this is much longer than the orbital periods of satellites inside the Hill radius that the integrator is\ndesigned to follow, so even a crude integrator should work\nwell. Moreover, our ability to reproduce the H\u00e9non diagram\n(compare Fig. 1 and the lower right panel of Fig. 2), the longterm stability of many of our orbits, and the similarity of the\ncharacteristic orbit shapes to those found by H\u00e9non (see \u00a73.1),\n\n\fDynamics of Distant Satellites\n\n5\n\nF IG . 2.- H\u00e9non diagrams for Jupiter under various circumstances (see \u00a73.1 for details). The satellite orbital plane initially coincides with Jupiter's. In each\npanel, the dotted region is the grid of initial conditions in the (\u0393, \u03be) plane. The two blank regions in the upper-right corner are forbidden. The filled circles in\ndifferent colors represent the initial conditions of orbits that survive for various times.\n\nall indicate that even at the largest distances probed here, the\nsymplectic integrator seems to work pretty well. As a further check, we have used the Bulirsch-Stoer integrator to follow satellite orbits around Uranus for 106 yr and found almost\nidentical results to the Wisdom-Holman integrator.\nWe terminate the integration if the distance of the satellite from the planet exceeds the semi-major axis of the planet\nsince at this point the satellite has escaped according to our\ndefinition at the end of \u00a71, or if the distance is less than\nthe semi-major axis of the outermost regular satellite of each\nplanet (being Callisto, Iapetus, Oberon and Triton respectively), since at this point the satellite lifetime against ejection\nor collision with the regular satellite or the planet is likely to\nbe short. Any test particles that cross either of these two radii\nare considered lost. We have experimented with including the\nquadrupole moment J2 of the planet (including the contribution from the inner regular satellites) but this has no detectable\n\neffect on our results.\n3. RESULTS\n3.1. Two-dimensional H\u00e9non diagrams\n\nWe first study cases in which the initial velocity vectors of\nsatellites lie in the planet orbital plane, i.e., \u03b6 = \u03b6\u0307 = 0. As\nwe have described, this is different from H\u00e9non's problem because: (i) we do not use Hill's approximation; (ii) planets such\nas Jupiter have non-zero eccentricity; and (iii) there are gravitational perturbations from other planets.\nAs an illustration we show how the stable region changes\nunder various conditions in Fig. 2, for satellites around Jupiter\nand an integration time 106 yr. We consider four situations:\n(a) Jupiter moves on its actual (slightly eccentric) orbit, including perturbations from the other three giant planets (upper\nleft); (b) the planar restricted three-body problem, in which\nJupiter travels on an orbit with its current eccentricity of 0.048\n\n\f6\n\nSHEN & TREMAINE\n\nF IG . 3.- Two-dimensional H\u00e9non diagrams for the four planets. Each orbit is integrated up to 108 yr under the gravitational influence of its host planet, the\nSun, and the other three giant planets. Notations are the same as Fig. 2.\n\nand the other planets are absent (upper right); (c) the planar\ncircular restricted three-body problem, in which Jupiter travels on a circular orbit with its current semi-major axis (bottom\nleft); (d) same as (c) except that the planet mass is 1/100 of\nthe Jupiter mass (bottom right).\nBy comparing Figs. 1 and 2 it is clear that case (d) in the\nbottom right panel best reproduces the original H\u00e9non diagram; this is not surprising since \u03bc \u2243 10\u22125 is smallest so\nHill's approximation is satisfied best, and the other conditions\nassumed in H\u00e9non's problem (circular planet orbit, no other\nplanets) are also satisfied. When using the actual Jupiter mass\nin (c), the outer retrograde stable region (i.e., the lower-left\nbranch) shifts and shrinks. The overall stability region shrinks\nfurther-but does not vanish-when Jupiter's orbit is eccentric as in case (b), and for the most realistic case (a).\nNote that 106 yr is only a small fraction of the lifetime of\nthe solar system, and possible erosion of the stable region over\nlonger times is somewhat indicated by the presence of a few\n\nred and blue dots in the upper panels of Fig. 2, indicating\norbits that are unstable on timescales of 104 and 105 yr.\nThese illustrative calculations show that some Jovian satellites orbiting well outside the Hill radius can survive for at\nleast 106 yr, although the stable region is substantially smaller\nthan in Hill's approximation to the circular restricted threebody problem and appears to erode slowly with time. They\nalso show that the stable region is larger (relative to the Hill radius) if the planet mass \u03bc is smaller, suggesting that the stable\nregions of the other giant planets may be larger than Jupiter's.\nWe now extend these calculations in the following ways:\n(i) we examine satellite orbits around all four giant planets,\nusing the actual planetary orbits including perturbations from\nthe three other planets; (ii) since stable orbits are found at the\nmost negative Jacobi constant (\u0393 = \u22126) examined in Fig. 2, we\nextend the grid of initial conditions to \u0393 = \u221216; (iii) we extend\nthe integration time from 106 yr to 108 yr.\nThe results are shown in Fig. 3. There are large regions\n\n\fDynamics of Distant Satellites\n\n7\n\nF IG . 4.- Two-dimensional H\u00e9non diagrams for Saturn only (left) and Uranus only (right); the effects of the other three planets are not included in the\nintegrations. In contrast to the results in Fig. 3, Saturn can host stable outer retrograde orbits, and most of the satellites that survive for 106 yr also survive for\n108 yr around both planets.\n\nof inner retrograde/prograde orbits that are stable for 108 yr.\nFor Jupiter, there are a few outer retrograde orbits that survive\nfor 108 yr; Wiegert et al. (2000) found no orbits that survived\nfor & 107 yr, but this may reflect their less complete coverage of phase space. For Saturn, the outer retrograde stable\nregion completely disappears in less than 106 yr, a conclusion\nalready reached by Wiegert et al. For Uranus and Neptune,\nin contrast, there is a large stable region of outer retrograde\norbits remaining after 108 yr. We expect that the stable regions around Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune will shrink somewhat further between 108 yr and 5 \u00d7 109 yr, the approximate\nage of the solar system, so we integrated some outer retrograde satellite orbits around these three planets for 109 yr. We\nfound that about a third of the Jovian orbits and over half of\nthe outer retrograde orbits for Uranus and Neptune shown in\nFig. 3 still survive. Thus it is very likely that Uranus and\nNeptune could still host primordial satellites on such orbits to\nthe present time. It is likely, but not certain, that similar satellites could survive around Jupiter, at least in small volumes of\nphase space.\nThe shrinkage of the stable region of the outer retrograde\nbranch between 106 and 108 yr, as well as the lack of stable\nouter retrograde orbits around Saturn, appear to be mainly due\nto perturbations from the other planets. To demonstrate this,\nwe ran two 108 yr integrations for Saturn only and Uranus\nonly. The results are shown in Fig. 4; in this case, Saturn can\nhost stable outer retrograde satellites for at least 108 yr, and\nthere is almost no difference in the size of the stable region\nbetween 106 and 108 yr for either planet.\nThe stable region around Uranus is larger than the one\naround Saturn in Fig. 4, and the stable regions around Uranus\nand Neptune are larger than the one around Jupiter in Fig. 3.\nThese differences are probably caused mostly by their different planet-to-Sun mass ratios \u03bc. As \u03bc increases, the outer\nretrograde stability branch in the lower left of the H\u00e9non diagram shrinks, and shifts upward (see H\u00e9non 1965; 1970, or\ncompare the two lower panels of Fig. 2).\nWe also notice in Figs. 2d and in the right panel of 4 that\nthere is a little tail or branch to the stable region around\n\n(\u0393, \u03be) = (\u22125, \u22122.5). We suspect this comes from H\u00e9non's periodic family g3 , which bifurcates from the periodic retrograde orbits at (\u0393, \u03be) = (\u22122, \u22121.2) and passes close to the point\n(\u0393, \u03be) = (\u22125, \u22122.5) (see H\u00e9non 1970, Fig. 13).\nWhat do these stable orbits look like? In Hill's approximation, the stable (outer and inner) retrograde and inner prograde orbits are generated from the periodic f and g families\nrespectively using the terminology of H\u00e9non (1969). We show\nexamples of stable orbits (i.e., those that survived for 108 yr)\naround Uranus in Fig. 5. For each example orbit, we plot the\ninstantaneous locations for the first one million years as dots\nwith the two stars marking the starting and ending locations.\nWe also plot the trajectory for several revolutions. Each orbit is plotted in both the non-rotating planetocentric x-y plane\n(left column) and the rotating \u03be-\u03b7 plane (right column). In the\nrotating frame, the inner prograde orbit (top panel) is elongated along the Sun-planet axis while the inner retrograde\norbit (middle panel) is elongated perpendicular to the Sunplanet axis. The outer retrograde orbit (bottom panel) is also\nelongated perpendicular to the Sun-planet axis and oscillates\nabout the planet as an ellipse with an axis ratio of approximately 2:1 (compare Fig. 11 of H\u00e9non 1970), as one would\nexpect from epicycle theory.\nNote that the stable retrograde orbits with \u03be close to\n\u22120.6934 in Fig. 3 regularly cross the Hill radius. Hence such\norbits are missed by the surveys of both Wiegert et al. and\nNesvorn\u00fd et al., who terminate their integrations if r < rH or\nr > rH , respectively.\n3.2. Three-dimensional H\u00e9non diagrams\n\nWe now extend the initial conditions in \u00a73.1 to three dimensions by including the scaled vertical coordinate \u03b6. As discussed in \u00a72.1, we consider a surface of section \u03b7 = \u03b6 = \u03be\u0307 = 0,\n\u03b7\u0307 > 0 at t = 0. Similar to the two-dimensional case, we\nsample the initial conditions using a fine grid in the (\u0393, \u03be)\nplane, and use equation (9) to generate initial velocities. We\nchoose a sequence of inclinations in the rotating frame, I =\n15\u25e6 , 30\u25e6 , 45\u25e6 , 60\u25e6 , 75\u25e6 . Each satellite orbit is then integrated\nfor 108 yr along with the four giant planets and the Sun.\n\n\f8\n\nSHEN & TREMAINE\n\nF IG . 5.- Examples of stable orbits around Uranus.

The notation is the same as in Fig. 8.\n\nThe general behavior when incorporating inclination is the\nerosion of stable regions in the H\u00e9non diagram. As an example, we show the results for Uranus in Fig. 6. The outer\nretrograde orbits quickly become unstable when the initial inclination exceeds \u2248 20\u25e6 . The inner retrograde stable region\nerodes with increasing inclination and disappears at I & 75\u25e6 .\nThe inner prograde stable region can survive even at I \u2248 75\u25e6 .\nThis asymmetry between inner retrograde and prograde orbits is due in part to the definition of inclination in the rotat-\n\ning frame3 . However, even when inclination is defined in the\nnon-rotating frame such an asymmetry may still be present\n(see \u0106uk & Burns 2004 for a discussion of the dynamical reasons for the asymmetry).\nTo separate the destabilizing effects of inclination from the\neffects of perturbations from other planets, we also ran these\n3 When translated into the non-rotating planetocentric frame, the inclinations of \"prograde\" (\"retrograde\") orbits are actually smaller (larger) than\nin the rotating frame. As we already noted in Fig. 1, under certain circumstances retrograde orbits in the rotating frame can even be prograde in the\nnon-rotating frame.\n\n\fDynamics of Distant Satellites\n\n13\n\nF IG . 12.- Left: Heliocentric angular velocities of the stable outer irregular satellites as a function of angular distance from the planet, as viewed from the\nSun in the non-rotating frame. Middle: Histograms of the difference between the heliocentric satellite semi-major axis and the planet semi-major axis for the\nstable outer irregular satellites, where the peaks of these distributions are arbitrarily scaled. Right: Histograms of the heliocentric eccentricity for the stable outer\nirregular satellites. The sampling of points is the same as we used to produce the spatial stability regions in \u00a73.3.\n\nthree-dimensional simulations for Uranus without the other\nplanets. We found that for I . 20\u25e6 , perturbations from other\nplanets do play a major role in eroding the region of stable\nouter retrograde orbits, as illustrated by comparing the upper\nleft and lower right panels of Fig. 6, which show the H\u00e9non\ndiagram for I = 15\u25e6 with and without the other planets. However, for I = 30\u25e6 , 45\u25e6 , 60\u25e6 , 75\u25e6 the results for Uranus alone are\nalmost identical to the realistic case which includes perturbations from the three other planets. This result suggests that\nbound retrograde orbits outside the Hill sphere may not exist\nat all for I & 20\u25e6 . This is expected because the Coriolis force,\nwhich stabilizes outer retrograde orbits by bending their trajectory towards the planet in the rotating frame, is reduced\nwhen the inclination angle I increases. This shrinkage of the\nstable outer retrograde branch with inclination is already noticed by comparing the right panel of Fig. 4 (I = 0) and the\nbottom-right panel of Fig. 6 (I = 15\u25e6 ).\nNote that the inclinations I are planetocentric and measured\nin the rotating frame. For low-inclination orbits along the\nouter retrograde branch they can be converted to heliocentric\ninclinations i using the approximate formula for small e\ni \u2248 2eI ,\n\n(10)\n\nwhere e is the heliocentric eccentricity. Thus our stability\nregion I . 20\u25e6 corresponds roughly to i . 4\u25e6 for e \u2248 0.1,\nthe typical heliocentric eccentricity of surviving satellites\nfor Uranus and Neptune (see Fig. 12); this is in reasonable\nagreement with Wiegert et al.'s estimate that most of their\nlong-lived orbits had i . 2\u25e6 , especially considering that our\nsampling of initial conditions is more complete than theirs.\nMikkola & Innanen (1997) and Mikkola et al. (2006) estimate analytically that the outer retrograde orbits are unstable\nif i > e (for a circular planet orbit), which implies instability\nif I & 30\u25e6 . Our own results show that all the test particles with\ninitial positions outside the Hill sphere cross the escape radius\na p well before 104 yr for I \u2265 30\u25e6 .\nAs described at the end of \u00a72.1, a limitation of these results\nis that the H\u00e9non diagram we have used will not display orbits trapped in a Kozai resonance, or other stable orbits whose\nargument of pericenter does not periodically pass through 0\nor \u03c0. To estimate the contribution of such orbits, we have\nconstructed a different set of three-dimensional H\u00e9non diagrams in which the initial conditions are changed from our\nusual choice \u03b7 = \u03be\u0307 = \u03b6 = 0, \u03b7\u0307 > 0 to \u03b7 = \u03be\u0307 = \u03b6\u0307 = 0, \u03b7\u0307 > 0 (i.e.,\n\nwhen the orbit is at its maximum height above the planet's\norbital plane, rather than crossing the orbital plane). In this\ncase, we define the initial inclination I \u2217 in the rotating frame\nby\n\u03b6\n.\n(11)\ntan I \u2217 =\n\u03be t=0\nThe results are shown in Figure 7, which should be compared\nto Figure 6. Each point in either set of H\u00e9non diagrams corresponds to a unique orbit, but orbits appearing in the H\u00e9non\ndiagrams of one figure at a given value of (\u0393, \u03be, I) may or\nmay not appear in the other figure, where they will have the\nsame value of \u0393 but possibly different values of \u03be and inclination. The stable regions are somewhat larger in Figure 7\nat a given inclination-for example, a few outer retrograde\nsatellites survive for 108 yr at I \u2217 = 30\u25e6 -but the conclusions\ndescribed above are not significantly altered. In the following discussion, we neglect stable orbits that do not appear in\nour fiducial H\u00e9non diagrams (i.e., using the surface of section\n\u03b7 = \u03be\u0307 = \u03b6 = 0, \u03b7\u0307 > 0); thus we may slightly underestimate the\nsize of the stable regions. More discussion on orbits trapped\nin the Kozai resonance inside the Hill sphere can be found in\nCarruba et al. (2002).\n3.3. Spatial stability regions\n\nWe now project the phase-space volume that hosts stable\norbits onto coordinate space, to explore where stable satellites\nmight be found.\nWe plot the positions\u0002of stable orbits\n\u0003 in the two-dimensional\nplane with coordinates (x2 + y2 )1/2 , z (non-rotating frame) or\n\u0002 2 2 1/2 \u0003\n(\u03be + \u03b7 ) , \u03b6 (rotating frame). Prograde and retrograde orbits are plotted separately on the left and right sides of a given\nfigure panel, where \"prograde\" and \"retrograde\" are defined\nin the frame used. We plot the position of each stable (up to\n108 yr) point in the H\u00e9non diagram at uniformly spaced times\n(every Myr) between 5 \u00d7 107 and 108 yr in Figs. 8 (Jupiter) to\n11 (Neptune).\nThe stability regions within the Hill sphere are very similar\nto those shown in Figs. 9-12 of Nesvorn\u00fd et al. (2003), though\nslightly larger because we show instantaneous position rather\nthan semi-major axis. For Jupiter and Saturn, the stable prograde orbits generally extend to \u223c 0.5rH ; the stable retrograde\norbits can extend further to \u223c 0.7rH , and nearly coplanar retrograde orbits even extend to \u223c rH for Jupiter. For Uranus and\n\n\f14\n\nSHEN & TREMAINE\n\nNeptune, both the prograde and retrograde stable orbits can\nextend a little bit further relative to the Hill sphere. No stable orbits exist at high latitudes, presumably because of Kozai\noscillations (Kozai 1962; Carruba et al. 2002; Nesvorn\u00fd et al.\n2003).\nIt is also notable that there are stable regions beyond the\nHill sphere for Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune, as we discussed in previous sections. This is particularly the case for\nUranus and Neptune. Most of these distant stable satellites\nare concentrated close to the orbital plane of the planet as\nfor Jupiter, although the appearance of a very thin layer in\nFigs. 8 (Jupiter)- 11 (Neptune) is somewhat an artifact of\nthe coarse sampling of inclinations in our initial conditions\n(I = 15\u25e6 , 30\u25e6 , 45\u25e6 , 60\u25e6 , 75\u25e6 ). Stable satellites can be found as\nfar as \u223c 5rH from Jupiter and even \u223c 10rH for Uranus and\nNeptune, and as high as 2.5rH above the orbital plane for the\nlatter two planets. In the following section we discuss briefly\nthe strategy of searches for these distant satellites.\n4. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have conducted a systematic survey of the stable regions\nof satellites around giant planets in the solar system, using numerical orbital integrations that include gravitational perturbations from the other planets. We confirm previous results\nfor satellites within the Hill sphere: stable retrograde satellites can exist further out than prograde satellites (e.g., H\u00e9non\n1970; Hamilton & Krivov 1997; Nesvorn\u00fd et al. 2003); and\nstable orbits cannot exist at high inclinations (e.g., Carruba et\nal. 2002; Nesvorn\u00fd et al. 2003).\nWe also confirm and extend the conclusions of Wiegert et\nal. (2000) that distant retrograde satellites (\"retrograde\" as defined in the rotating frame) can survive well beyond the Hill\nsphere for at least 108 \u2013109 yr, and probably for the lifetime of\nthe solar system. Uranus and Neptune are the most promising\nhost planets for such distant satellites, since their stability regions have the largest extent (e.g., Fig. 10-11). Jupiter has a\nsmaller stable region (Fig. 8), and Saturn appears to have no\nstable regions beyond the Hill radius (Fig. 9).\nRemarkably, there is a gap between the inner and outer stability zones for retrograde satellites, extending from about rH\nto 2rH , in which almost no stable orbits exist.\nTo check whether any of the proposed distant satellites have\nalready been discovered as Centaurs, we take the positions\n4\n\nand velocities of the known Centaurs from the IAU Minor\nPlanet Center4 that have planetocentric distances smaller than\nthe semi-major axes of each of the four giant planets at the\nlast observed epoch. There are 31 Centaurs (Jupiter 1; Uranus\n16; Neptune 14) that satisfy the criterion. We numerically\nintegrated these objects along with the Sun and giant planets\nfor 108 yr, but none of them survived as satellites according\nto the definition in \u00a71.\nSearches for satellites far beyond the Hill radius can be\ncarried out either with dedicated deep, wide-angle surveys\naround the giant planets, or through all-sky surveys such as\nPan-STARRS and LSST. The most promising search areas\nare close to the orbital plane of the planet, since only lowinclination orbits survive (e.g., compare Fig. 3 and Fig. 6).\nIn Fig. 12 (left panel) we show the heliocentric angular velocity of the stable outer retrograde satellites as a function of\nangular distance from the planet as viewed from the Sun, for\nJupiter (black), Uranus (blue) and Neptune (red) respectively,\nsampled every Myr between 5 \u00d7 107 and 108 yr.\nIn the middle and right panels of Fig. 12 we show histograms of the difference in heliocentric semi-major axis from\ntheir host planet and heliocentric eccentricities for the stable\nouter retrograde satellites. These distributions can be used to\ncull a large sample for potential satellites. Once a candidate\nis identified with reliable orbit elements, a long-term orbital\nintegration should be run to confirm its satellite nature.\nThe discovery and characterization of satellites beyond the\nHill sphere would provide rich information about the early\nformation of the solar system. Fabrycky (2008; also see Kortenkamp 2005) recently performed simulations of capture of\nneighboring planetesimals from the circumstellar disk during\nslow planet growth, and found that such distant satellites are\na natural outcome for Uranus and Neptune. Thus an inventory of this potential population of bodies would enhance our\nunderstanding of the formation of planets and their satellites\nin the early solar system, and the properties of the primordial\nplanetesimal disk.\n\nThis research was supported in part by NASA grant\nNNX08AH83G.
