These structures show up not only\nin mathematics, where they form a useful generalization of nonabelian gerbes\n[10], but also in physics, where they can be used to describe parallel transport\nof strings [31, 32].\nThe concepts of '\u010cech cohomology' and 'classifying space' play a well-known\nand fundamental role in the theory of bundles. For any topological group G,\nprincipal G-bundles over a space M are classified by the first \u010cech cohomology\n\u2217 Department of Mathematics, University of California, Riverside, CA 92521, USA.

Furthermore, under some mild conditions, these\n\u010cech cohomology classes are in 1-1 correspondence with homotopy classes of\nmaps from M to the classifying space BG. This lets us define characteristic\nclasses for bundles, coming from cohomology classes for BG.\nAll these concepts and results can be generalized from bundles to 2-bundles.\nBartels [6] has defined principal G-2-bundles where G is a 'topological 2-group':\nroughly speaking, a categorified version of a topological group. Furthermore, his\nwork shows how principal G-2-bundles over M are classified by \u021e 1 (M, G), the\nfirst \u010cech cohomology of M with coefficients in G. This form of cohomology,\nalso known as 'nonabelian cohomology', is familiar from work on nonabelian\ngerbes [9, 19].\nIn fact, under mild conditions on G and M , there is a 1-1 correspondence\nbetween \u021e 1 (M, G) and the set of homotopy classes of maps from M to a certain\nspace B|G|: the classifying space of the geometric realization of the nerve of\nG. So, B|G| serves as a classifying space for the topological 2-group G! This\npaper seeks to provide an introduction to topological 2-groups and nonabelian\ncohomology leading up to a self-contained proof of this fact.\nIn his pioneering work on this subject, Jur\u010do [22] asserted that a certain space\nhomotopy equivalent to ours is a classifying space for the first \u010cech cohomology\nwith coefficients in G. However, there are some gaps in his argument for this\nassertion (see Section 5.2 for details).\nLater, Baas, B\u00f6kstedt and Kro [2] gave the definitive treatment of classifying\nspaces for 2-bundles. For any 'good' topological 2-category C, they construct a\nclassifying space BC. They then show that for any space M with the homotopy\ntype of a CW complex, concordance classes of 'charted C-2-bundles' correspond\nto homotopy classes of maps from M to BC. In particular, a topological 2-group\nis just a topological 2-category with one object and with all morphisms and 2morphisms invertible - and in this special case, their result almost reduces to\nthe fact mentioned above.\nThere are some subtleties, however. Most importantly, while their 'charted\nC-2-bundles' reduce precisely to our principal G-2-bundles, they classify these 2bundles up to concordance, while we classify them up to a superficially different\nequivalence relation. Two G-2-bundles over a space X are 'concordant' if they\nare restrictions of some G-2-bundle over X \u00d7 [0, 1] to the two ends X \u00d7 {0}\nand X \u00d7 {1}. This makes it easy to see that homotopic maps from X to the\nclassifying space define concordant G-2-bundles. We instead consider two G-2bundles to be equivalent if their defining \u010cech 1-cocycles are cohomologous. In\nthis approach, some work is required to show that homotopic maps from X to\nthe classifying space define equivalent G-2-bundles. A priori, it is not obvious\nthat two G-2-bundles are equivalent in this \u010cech sense if and only if they are\nconcordant. However, since the classifying space of Baas, B\u00f6kstedt and Kro\nis homotopy equivalent to the one we use, it follows from our work that these\nequivalence relations are the same - at least given G and M satisfying the\ntechnical conditions of both their result and ours.\nWe also discuss an interesting example: the 'string 2-group' String(G) of a\nsimply-connected compact simple Lie group G [4, 20]. As its name suggests,\n2\n\n\fthis 2-group is of special interest in physics. Mathematically, a key fact is that\n|String(G)| - the geometric realization of the nerve of String(G) - is the 3connected cover of G. Using this, one can compute the rational cohomology of\nB|String(G)|. This is nice, because these cohomology classes give 'characteristic\nclasses' for principal G-2-bundles, and when M is a manifold one can hope to\ncompute these in terms of a connection and its curvature, much as one does for\nordinary principal bundles with a Lie group as structure group.\nSection 2 is an overview, starting with a review of the classic results that\npeople are now categorifying. Section 3 reviews four viewpoints on topological\n2-groups. Section 4 explains nonabelian cohomology with coefficients in a topological 2-group. Finally, in Section 5 we prove the results stated in Section 2,\nand comment a bit further on the work of Jur\u010do and Baas\u2013B\u00f6kstedt\u2013Kro.\n\n2\n\nOverview\n\nOnce one knows about 'topological 2-groups', it is irresistibly tempting to generalize all ones favorite results about topological groups to these new entities.\nSo, let us begin with a quick review of some classic results about topological\ngroups and their classifying spaces.\nSuppose that G is a topological group. The \u010cech cohomology \u021e 1 (M, G) of\na topological space M with coefficients in G is a set carefully designed to be in\n1-1 correspondence with the set of isomorphism classes of principal G-bundles\non M . Let us recall how this works.\nFirst suppose U = {Ui } is an open cover of M and P is a principal G-bundle\nover M that is trivial when restricted to each open set Ui . Then by comparing\nlocal trivialisations of P over Ui and Uj we can define maps gij : Ui \u2229 Uj \u2192 G:\nthe transition functions of the bundle. On triple intersections Ui \u2229Uj \u2229Uk , these\nmaps satisfy a cocycle condition:\ngij (x)gjk (x) = gik (x)\nA collection of maps gij : Ui \u2229 Uj \u2192 G satisfying this condition is called a '\u010cech\n1-cocycle' subordinate to the cover U. Any such 1-cocycle defines a principal\nG-bundle over M that is trivial over each set Ui .\nNext, suppose we have two principal G-bundles over M that are trivial over\n\u2032\neach set Ui , described by \u010cech 1-cocycles gij and gij\n, respectively. These bundles\nare isomorphic if and only if for some maps fi : Ui \u2192 G we have\n\u2032\ngij (x)fj (x) = fi (x)gij\n(x)\n\non every double intersection Ui \u2229 Uj . In this case we say the \u010cech 1-cocycles\nare 'cohomologous'. We define \u021e 1 (U, G) to be the quotient of the set of \u010cech\n1-cocycles subordinate to U by this equivalence relation.\nRecall that a 'good' cover of M is an open cover U for which all the nonempty finite intersections of open sets Ui in U are contractible. We say a space\nM admits good covers if any cover of M has a good cover that refines it. For\n3\n\n\fexample, any (paracompact Hausdorff) smooth manifold admits good covers, as\ndoes any simplicial complex.\nIf M admits good covers, \u021e 1 (U, G) is independent of the choice of good cover\nU. So, we can denote it simply by \u021e 1 (M, G). Furthermore, this set \u021e 1 (M, G) is\nin 1-1 correspondence with the set of isomorphism classes of principal G-bundles\nover M . The reason is that we can always trivialize any principal G-bundle over\nthe open sets in a good cover.\nFor more general spaces, we need to define the \u010cech cohomology more carefully. If M is a paracompact Hausdorff space, we can define it to be the limit\n\u021e 1 (M, G) = lim \u021e 1 (U, G)\n\u2212\u2192\nU\n\nover all open covers, partially ordered by refinement.\nIt is a classic result in topology that \u021e 1 (M, G) can be understood using\nhomotopy theory with the help of Milnor's construction [14, 28] of the classifying\nspace BG:\nTheorem 0. Let G be a topological group. Then there is a topological space\nBG with the property that for any paracompact Hausdorff space M , there is a\nbijection\n\u021e 1 (M, G) \u223c\n= [M, BG]\nHere [X, Y ] denotes the set of homotopy classes of maps from X into Y . The\ntopological space BG is called the classifying space of G. There is a canonical\nprincipal G-bundle on BG, called the universal G-bundle, and the theorem\nabove is usually understood as the assertion that every principal G-bundle P\non M is obtained by pullback from the universal G-bundle under a certain map\nM \u2192 BG (the classifying map of P ).\nNow let us discuss how to generalize all these results to topological 2-groups.\nFirst of all, what is a '2-group' ? It is like a group, but 'categorified'. While a\ngroup is a set equipped with functions describing multiplication and inverses,\nand an identity element, a 2-group is a category equipped with functors describing multiplication and inverses, and an identity object. Indeed, 2-groups are also\nknown as 'categorical groups'.\nA down-to-earth way to work with 2-groups involves treating them as 'crossed\nmodules'. A crossed module consists of a pair of groups H and G, together\nwith a homomorphism t : H \u2192 G and an action \u03b1 of G on H satisfying two\nconditions, equations (4) and (5) below. Crossed modules were introduced by\nJ. H. C. Whitehead [38] without the aid of category theory. Mac Lane and\nWhitehead [24] later proved that just as the fundamental group captures all the\nhomotopy-invariant information about a connected pointed homotopy 1-type, a\ncrossed module captures all the homotopy-invariant information about a connected pointed homotopy 2-type. By the 1960s it was clear to Verdier and others\nthat crossed modules are essentially the same as categorical groups. The first\npublished proof of this may be due to Brown and Spencer [12].\n\n4\n\n\fJust as one can define principal G-bundles over a space M for any topological\ngroup G, one can define 'principal G-2-bundles' over M for any topological 2group G. Just as a principal G-bundle has a copy of G as fiber, a principal\nG-2-bundle has a copy of G as fiber. Readers interested in more details are\nurged to read Bartels' thesis, available online [6]. We shall have nothing else to\nsay about principal G-2-bundles except that they are classified by a categorified\nversion of \u010cech cohomology, denoted \u021e 1 (M, G).\nAs before, we can describe this categorified \u010cech cohomology as a set of\ncocycles modulo an equivalence relation. Let U be a cover of M . If we think\nof the 2-group G in terms of its associated crossed module (G, H, t, \u03b1), then a\ncocycle subordinate to U consists (in part) of maps gij : Ui \u2229 Uj \u2192 G as before.\nHowever, we now 'weaken' the cocycle condition and only require that\nt(hijk )gij gjk = gik\n\n(1)\n\nfor some maps hijk : Ui \u2229 Uj \u2229 Uk \u2192 H. These maps are in turn required to\nsatisfy a cocycle condition of their own on quadruple intersections, namely\n\u03b1(gij )(hjkl )hijl = hijk hikl\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03b1 is the action of G on H. This mildly intimidating equation will be easier\nto understand when we draw it as a commuting tetrahedron - see equation\n(6) in Section 4. The pair (gij , hijk ) is called a G-valued \u010cech 1-cocycle\nsubordinate to U.\n\u2032\n, h\u2032ijk ) are cohomologous\nSimilarly, we say two cocycles (gij , hijk ) and (gij\nif\n\u2032\nt(kij )gij fj = fi gij\n(3)\nfor some maps fi : Ui \u2192 G and kij : Ui \u2229 Uj \u2192 H, which must make a certain\nprism commute - see equation (7). We define \u021e 1 (U, G) to be the set of cohomology classes of G-valued \u010cech 1-cocycles. To capture the entire cohomology\nset \u021e 1 (M, G), we must next take a limit of the sets \u021e 1 (U, G) as U ranges over\nall covers of M . For more details we refer to Section 4.\nTheorem 0 generalizes nicely from topological groups to topological 2-groups.\nBut, following the usual tradition in algebraic topology, we shall henceforth work\nin the category of k-spaces, i.e., compactly generated weak Hausdorff spaces. So,\nby 'topological space' we shall always mean a k-space, and by 'topological group'\nwe shall mean a group object in the category of k-spaces.\nTheorem 1. Suppose that G is a well-pointed topological 2-group and M is a\nparacompact Hausdorff space admitting good covers. Then there is a bijection\n\u021e 1 (M, G) \u223c\n= [M, B|G|]\nwhere the topological group |G| is the geometric realization of the nerve of G.\nOne term here requires explanation. A topological group G is said to be 'well\npointed' if (G, 1) is an NDR pair, or in other words if the inclusion {1} \u0592\u2192 G\n5\n\n\fis a closed cofibration. We say that a topological 2-group G is well pointed\nif the topological groups G and H in its corresponding crossed module are well\npointed. For example, any 'Lie 2-group' is well pointed: a topological 2-group is\ncalled a Lie 2-group if G and H are Lie groups and the maps t, \u03b1 are smooth.\nMore generally, any 'Fr\u00e9chet Lie 2-group' [4] is well pointed. We explain the\nimportance of this notion in Section 5.1.\nBartels [6] has already considered two examples of principal G-2-bundles,\ncorresponding to abelian gerbes and nonabelian gerbes. Let us discuss the\nclassification of these before turning to a third, more novel example.\nFor an abelian gerbe [7], we first choose an abelian topological group H -\nin practice, usually just U(1). Then, we form the crossed module with G = 1\nand this choice of H, with t and \u03b1 trivial. The corresponding topological 2group deserves to be called H[1], since it is a 'shifted version' of H. Bartels\nshows that the classification of abelian H-gerbes matches the classification of\nH[1]-2-bundles. It is well-known that\n|H[1]| \u223c\n= BH\nso the classifying space for abelian H-gerbes is\nB|H[1]| \u223c\n= B(BH)\nIn the case H = U(1), this classifying space is just K(Z, 3). So, in this case, we\nrecover the well-known fact that abelian U(1)-gerbes over M are classified by\n[M, K(Z, 3)] \u223c\n= H 3 (M, Z)\njust as principal U(1) bundles are classified by H 2 (M, Z).\nFor a nonabelian gerbe [9, 18, 19], we fix any topological group H. Then\nwe form the crossed module with G = Aut(H) and this choice of H, where\nt : H \u2192 G sends each element of H to the corresponding inner automorphism,\nand the action of G on H is the tautologous one. This gives a topological 2-group\ncalled AUT(H). Bartels shows that the classification of nonabelian H-gerbes\nmatches the classification of AUT(H)-2-bundles. It follows that, under suitable\nconditions on H, nonabelian H-gerbes are classified by homotopy classes of\nmaps into B|AUT(H)|.\nA third application of Theorem 1 arises when G is a simply-connected compact simple Lie group. For any such group there is an isomorphism H 3 (G, Z) \u223c\n=\nZ and the generator \u03bd \u2208 H 3 (G, Z) transgresses to a characteristic class c \u2208\nH 4 (BG, Z) \u223c\n= Z. Associated to \u03bd is a map G \u2192 K(Z, 3) and it can be shown\nthat the homotopy fiber of this can be given the structure of a topological group\n\u011c. This group \u011c is the 3-connected cover of G. When G = Spin(n), this group\n\u011c is known as String(n). In general, we might call \u011c the string group of\nG. Note that until one picks a specific construction for the homotopy fiber,\n\u011c is only defined up to homotopy - or more precisely, up to equivalence of\nA\u221e -spaces.\nIn [4], under the above hypotheses on G, a topological 2-group subsequently\ndubbed the string 2-group of G was introduced. Let us denote this by\n6\n\n\fString(G). A key result about String(G) is that the topological group |String(G)|\nis equivalent to \u011c. By construction String(G) is a Fr\u00e9chet Lie 2-group, hence\nwell pointed. So, from Theorem 1 we immediately conclude:\nCorollary 1. Suppose that G is a simply-connected compact simple Lie group.\nSuppose M is a paracompact Hausdorff space admitting good covers. Then there\nare bijections between the following sets:\n\u2022 the set of equivalence classes of principal String(G)-2-bundles over M ,\n\u2022 the set of isomorphism classes of principal \u011c-bundles over M ,\n\u2022 \u021e 1 (M, String(G)),\n\u2022 \u021e 1 (M, \u011c),\n\u2022 [M, B \u011c].\nOne can describe the rational cohomology of B \u011c in terms of the rational\ncohomology of BG, which is well-understood. The following result was pointed\nout to us by Matt Ando [1], and later discussed by Greg Ginot [17]:\nTheorem 2. Suppose that G is a simply-connected compact simple Lie group,\nand let \u011c be the string group of G. Let c \u2208 H 4 (BG, Q) = Q denote the transgression of the generator \u03bd \u2208 H 3 (G, Q) = Q. Then there is a ring isomorphism\nH \u2217 (B \u011c, Q) \u223c\n= H \u2217 (BG, Q)/hci\nwhere hci is the ideal generated by c.\nAs a result, we obtain characteristic classes for String(G)-2-bundles:\nCorollary 2. Suppose that G is a simply-connected compact simple Lie group\nand M is a paracompact Hausdorff space admitting good covers. Then an equivalence class of principal String(G)-2-bundles over M determines a ring homomorphism\nH \u2217 (BG, Q)/hci \u2192 H \u2217 (M, Q)\nTo see this, we use Corollary 1 to reinterpret an equivalence class of principal\nG-2-bundles over M as a homotopy class of maps f : M \u2192 B|G|. Picking any\nrepresentative f , we obtain a ring homomorphism\nf \u2217 : H \u2217 (B|G|, Q) \u2192 H \u2217 (M, Q).\nThis is independent of the choice of representative. Then, we use Theorem 2.\nIt is a nice problem to compute the rational characteristic classes of a principal String(G)-2-bundle over a manifold using de Rham cohomology. It should\nbe possible to do this using the curvature of an arbitrary connection on the\n2-bundle, just as for ordinary principal bundles with a Lie group as structure\ngroup. Sati, Schreiber and Stasheff [31] have recently made excellent progress\non solving this problem and its generalizations to n-bundles for higher n.\n7\n\n\f3\n\nTopological 2-Groups\n\nIn this section we recall four useful perspectives on topological 2-groups. For a\nmore detailed account, we refer the reader to [3].\nRecall that for us, a 'topological space' really means a k-space, and a 'topological group' really means a group object in the category of k-spaces. A\ntopological 2-group is a groupoid in the category of topological groups. In\nother words, it is a groupoid G where the set Ob(G) of objects and the set\nMor(G) of morphisms are each equipped with the structure of a topological\ngroup such that the source and target maps s, t : Mor(G) \u2192 Ob(G), the map\ni : Ob(G) \u2192 Mor(G) assigning each object its identity morphism, the composition map \u25e6 : Mor(G) \u00d7Ob(G) Mor(G) \u2192 Mor(G), and the map sending each\nmorphism to its inverse are all continuous group homomorphisms.\nEquivalently, we can think of a topological 2-group as a group in the category\nof topological groupoids. A topological groupoid is a groupoid G where\nOb(G) and Mor(G) are topological spaces (or more precisely, k-spaces) and\nall the groupoid operations just listed are continuous maps. We say that a\nfunctor f : G \u2192 G \u2032 between topological groupoids is continuous if the maps\nf : Ob(G) \u2192 Ob(G \u2032 ) and f : Mor(G) \u2192 Mor(G \u2032 ) are continous. A group in\nthe category of topological groupoids is such a thing equipped with continuous\nfunctors m : G \u00d7 G \u2192 G, inv : G \u2192 G and a unit object 1 \u2208 G satisfying the usual\ngroup axioms, written out as commutative diagrams.\nThis second viewpoint is useful because any topological groupoid G has a\n'nerve' N G, a simplicial space where the space of n-simplices consists of composable strings of morphisms\nf1\n\nfn\u22121\n\nf2\n\nfn\n\nx0 \u2212\u2192 x1 \u2212\u2192 * * * \u2212\u2192 xn\u22121 \u2212\u2192 xn\nTaking the geometric realization of this nerve, we obtain a topological space\nwhich we denote as |G| for short. If G is a topological 2-group, its nerve inherits\na group structure, so that N G is a topological simplicial group. This in turn\nmakes |G| into a topological group.\nA third way to understand topological 2-groups is to view them as topological crossed modules. Recall that a topological crossed module (G, H, t, \u03b1)\nconsists of topological groups G and H together with a continuous homomorphism\nt: H \u2192 G\nand a continuous action\n\u03b1: G \u00d7 H \u2192 H\n(g, h) 7\u2192 \u03b1(g)h\nof G as automorphisms of H, satisfying the following two identities:\nt(\u03b1(g)(h)) = gt(h)g \u22121\n\u2032\n\n\u2032 \u22121\n\n\u03b1(t(h))(h ) = hh h\n8\n\n.\n\n(4)\n(5)\n\n\fThe first equation above implies that the map t : H \u2192 G is equivariant for the\naction of G on H defined by \u03b1 and the action of G on itself by conjugation. The\nsecond equation is called the Peiffer identity. When no confusion is likely to\nresult, we will sometimes denote the 2-group corresponding to a crossed module\n(G, H, t, \u03b1) simply by H \u2192 G.\nEvery topological crossed module determines a topological 2-group and vice\nversa. Since there are some choices of convention involved in this construction,\nwe briefly review it to fix our conventions. Given a topological crossed module\n(G, H, t, \u03b1), we define a topological 2-group G as follows. First, define the group\nOb(G) of objects of G and the group Mor(G) of morphisms of G by\nOb(G) = G,\n\nMor(G) = H \u22ca G\n\nwhere the semidirect product H \u22ca G is formed using the left action of G on H\nvia \u03b1:\n(h, g) * (h\u2032 , g \u2032 ) = (h\u03b1(g)(h\u2032 ), gg \u2032 )\nfor g, g \u2032 \u2208 G and h, h\u2032 \u2208 H. The source and target of a morphism (h, g) \u2208\nMor(G) are defined by\ns(h, g) = g\n\nand\n\nt(h, g) = t(h)g\n\n(Denoting both the target map t : Mor(G) \u2192 Ob(G) and the homomorphism\nt : H \u2192 G by the same letter should not cause any problems, since the first is\nthe restriction of the second to H \u2286 Mor(G).) The identity morphism of an\nobject g \u2208 Ob(G) is defined by\ni(g) = (1, g).\nFinally, the composite of the morphisms\n\u03b1 = (h, g) : g \u2192 t(h)g\n\n\u03b2 = (h\u2032 , t(h)g) : t(h)g \u2192 t(h\u2032 h)g \u2032\n\nand\n\nis defined to be\n\u03b2 \u25e6 \u03b1 = (h\u2032 h, g) : g \u2192 t(h\u2032 h)g\nIt is easy to check that with these definitions, G is a 2-group. Conversely, given\na topological 2-group G, we define a crossed module (G, H, t, \u03b1) by setting G\nto be Ob(G), H to be ker(s) \u2282 Mor(G), t to be the restriction of the target\nhomomorphism t : Mor(G) \u2192 Ob(G) to the subgroup H \u2282 Mor(G), and setting\n\u03b1(g)(h) = i(g)hi(g)\u22121\nIf G is any topological group then there is a topological crossed module\n1 \u2192 G where t and \u03b1 are trivial. The underlying groupoid of the corresponding\ntopological 2-group has G as its space of objects, and only identity morphisms.\nWe sometimes call this 2-group the discrete topological 2-group associated to\nG - where 'discrete' is used in the sense of category theory, not topology!\n\n9\n\n\fAt the other extreme, if H is a topological group then it follows from the\nPeiffer identity that H \u2192 1 can be made into topological crossed module if and\nonly if H is abelian, and then in a unique way. This is because a groupoid with\none object and H as morphisms can be made into a 2-group precisely when H\nis abelian. We already mentioned this 2-group in the previous section, where\nwe called it H[1].\nWe will also need to talk about homomorphisms of 2-groups. We shall\nunderstand these in the strictest possible sense. So, we say a homomorphism of topological 2-groups is a functor such that f : Ob(G) \u2192 Ob(G \u2032 )\nand f : Mor(G) \u2192 Mor(G \u2032 ) are both continuous homomorphisms of topological groups. We can also describe f in terms of the crossed modules (G, H, t, \u03b1)\nand (G\u2032 , H \u2032 , t\u2032 , \u03b1\u2032 ) associated to G and G \u2032 respectively. In these terms the data\nof the functor f is described by the commutative diagram\nH\n\nf\n\nt\u2032\n\nt\n\n\u000f\nG\n\n/ H\u2032\n\nf\n\n\u000f\n/ G\u2032\n\nwhere the upper f denotes the restriction of f : Mor(G) \u2192 Mor(G \u2032 ) to a map\nfrom H to H \u2032 . (We are using f to mean several different things, but this makes\nthe notation less cluttered, and should not cause any confusion.) The maps\nf : G \u2192 G\u2032 and f : H \u2192 H \u2032 must both be continuous homomorphisms, and\nmoreover must satisfy an equivariance property with respect to the actions of\nG on H and G\u2032 on H \u2032 : we have\nf (\u03b1(g)(h)) = \u03b1(f (g))(f (h))\nfor all g \u2208 G and h \u2208 H.\nFinally, we will need to talk about short exact sequences of topological groups\nand 2-groups. Here the topology is important. If G is a topological group and\nH is a normal topological subgroup of G, then we can define an action of H\non G by right translation. In some circumstances, the projection G \u2192 G/H\nis a Hurewicz fibration. For instance, this is the case if G is a Lie group and\nH is a closed normal subgroup of G. We define a short exact sequence of\ntopological groups to be a sequence\n1\u2192H \u2192G\u2192K\u21921\nof topological groups and continuous homomorphisms such that the underlying\nsequence of groups is exact and the map underlying the homomorphism G \u2192 K\nis a Hurewicz fibration.\nSimilarly, we define a short exact sequence of topological 2-groups to be\na sequence\n1 \u2192 G \u2032 \u2192 G \u2192 G \u2032\u2032 \u2192 1\n\n10\n\n\fof topological 2-groups and continuous homomorphisms between them such that\nboth the resulting sequences\n1 \u2192 Ob(G \u2032 ) \u2192 Ob(G) \u2192 Ob(G \u2032\u2032 ) \u2192 1\n1 \u2192 Mor(G \u2032 ) \u2192 Mor(G) \u2192 Mor(G \u2032\u2032 ) \u2192 1\nare short exact sequences of topological groups. Again, we can interpret this\nin terms of the associated crossed modules: if (G, H, t, \u03b1), (G\u2032 , H \u2032 , t\u2032 , \u03b1\u2032 ) and\n(G\u2032\u2032 , H \u2032\u2032 , t\u2032\u2032 , \u03b1\u2032\u2032 ) denote the associated crossed modules, then it can be shown\nthat the sequence of topological 2-groups 1 \u2192 G \u2032 \u2192 G \u2192 G \u2032\u2032 \u2192 1 is exact if and\nonly if both rows in the commutative diagram\n1\n\n/ H\u2032\n\n/H\n\n/ H \u2032\u2032\n\n/1\n\n1\n\n\u000f\n/ G\u2032\n\n\u000f\n/G\n\n\u000f\n/ G\u2032\u2032\n\n/1\n\nare short exact sequences of topological groups. In this situation we also say we\nhave a short exact sequence of topological crossed modules.\nAt times we shall also need a fourth viewpoint on topological 2-groups: they\nare strict topological 2-groupoids with a single object, say \u2022. In this approach,\nwhat we had been calling 'objects' are renamed 'morphisms', and what we had\nbeen calling 'morphisms' are renamed '2-morphisms'. This verbal shift can be\nconfusing, so we will not engage in it! However, the 2-groupoid viewpoint is\nvery handy for diagrammatic reasoning in nonabelian cohomology. We draw\ng \u2208 Ob(G) as an arrow:\ng\n/\u2022\n\u2022\nand draw (h, g) \u2208 Mor(G) as a bigon:\ng\n\n\u2022\n\u0013\n\nh\n\n%\n9\u2022\n\ng\u2032\n\nwhere g \u2032 is the target of (h, g), namely t(h)g. With our conventions, horizontal\ncomposition of 2-morphisms is then given by:\ng1 g2\ng1\n\n\u2022\n\nh1\n\n\u0013\ng1\u2032\n\n%\n\ng2\n\n9\u2022\n\nh2\n\n\u0013\n\n%\n\n9\u2022\n\n=\n\ng2\u2032\n\n\u2022\n\nh1 \u03b1(g1 )(h2 )\n\n\u0013\ng1\u2032 g2\u2032\n\n11\n\n$\n\n:\u2022\n\n\fwhile vertical composition is given by:\ng\ng\nh\n\n\u0013\n\n\u2022\n\n/\u2022\nC\n\nh\u2032\n\n\u0013\ng\n\n4\n\n\u001b\n\n=\n\n\u2022\n\u0013\n\nh\u2032 h\n\n%\n9\u2022\n\ng\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nNonabelian Cohomology\n\nIn Section 2 we gave a quick sketch of nonabelian cohomology. The subject\ndeserves a more thorough and more conceptual explanation.\nAs a warmup, consider the \u010cech cohomology of a space M with coefficients\nin a topological group G. In this case, Segal [33] realized that we can reinterpret\na \u010cech 1-cocycle as a functor. Suppose U is an open cover of M . Then there\nis a topological groupoid \u00db whose objects are pairs (x, i) with x \u2208 Ui , and with\na single morphism from (x, i) to (x, j) when x \u2208 Ui \u2229 Uj , and none otherwise.\nWe can also think of G as a topological groupoid with a single object \u2022. Segal's\nkey observation was that a continuous functor\ng : \u00db \u2192 G\nis the same as a normalized \u010cech 1-cocycle subordinate to U.\nTo see this, note that a functor g : \u00db \u2192 G maps each object of \u00db to \u2022, and\neach morphism (x, i) \u2192 (x, j) to some gij (x) \u2208 G. For the functor to preserve\ncomposition, it is necessary and sufficient to have the cocycle equation\ngij (x)gjk (x) = gik (x)\nWe can draw this suggestively as a commuting triangle in the groupoid G:\n\ngij (x)\n\n\u2022\n\nF \u2022 11\n11\n11\n11gjk (x)\n11\n11\n\u0018\n/\u2022\n\ngik (x)\n\nFor the functor to preserve identities, it is necessary and sufficient to have the\nnormalization condition gii (x) = 1.\n\u2032\nIn fact, even more is true: two cocycles gij and gij\nsubordinate to U are\ncohomologous if and only if the corresponding functors g and g \u2032 from \u00db to G\nhave a continuous natural isomorphism between them. To see this, note that gij\n\u2032\nand gij\nare cohomologous precisely when there are maps fi : Ui \u2192 G satisfying\n\u2032\ngij (x)fj (x) = fi (x)gij\n(x)\n\n12\n\n\fWe can draw this equation as a commuting square in the groupoid G:\n\u2022\n\ngij (x)\n\n/\u2022\nfj (x)\n\nfi (x)\n\n\u000f\n\u2022\n\n\u2032\ngij\n(x)\n\n\u000f\n/\u2022\n\nThis is precisely the naturality square for a natural isomorphism between the\nfunctors g and g \u2032 .\nOne can obtain \u010cech cohomology with coefficients in a 2-group by categorifying Segal's ideas. Suppose G is a topological 2-group and let (G, H, t, \u03b1) be\nthe corresponding topological crossed module. Now G is the same as a topological 2-groupoid with one object \u2022. So, it is no longer appropriate to consider\nmere functors from \u00db into G. Instead, we should consider weak 2-functors, also\nknown as 'pseudofunctors' [23]. For this, we should think of \u00db as a topological\n2-groupoid with only identity 2-morphisms.\nLet us sketch how this works. A weak 2-functor g : \u00db \u2192 G sends each object\nof \u00db to \u2022, and each 1-morphism (x, i) \u2192 (x, j) to some gij (x) \u2208 G. However,\ncomposition of 1-morphisms is only weakly preserved. This means the above\ntriangle will now commute only up to isomorphism:\n\ngij\n\n\u2022\n\nF \u2022 11\n11\n11\n1 gjk\nhijk 11\n11\n1\u0018\n\u0013\n/\u2022\n\ngik\n\nwhere for readability we have omitted the dependence on x \u2208 Ui \u2229 Uj \u2229 Uk .\nTranslated into equations, this triangle says that we have continuous maps\nhijk : Ui \u2229 Uj \u2229 Uk \u2192 H satisfying\ngik (x) = t(hijk (x))gij (x)gjk (x)\nThis is precisely equation (1) from Section 2.\nFor a weak 2-functor, it is not merely true that composition is preserved up\nto isomorphism: this isomorphism is also subject to a coherence law. Namely,\n\n13\n\n\fthe following tetrahedron must commute:\n\ngjk\nhijk\n\nhjkl\n\ngik\ngij\n\nhikl\n\ngkl\ngjl\n\nhijl\n(6)\ngil\nwhere again we have omitted the dependence on x. The commutativity of this\ntetrahedron is equivalent to the following equation:\n\u03b1(gij )(hjkl )hijl = hijk hikl\nholding for all x \u2208 Ui \u2229 Uj \u2229 Uk \u2229 Ul . This is equation (2).\nA weak 2-functor may also preserve identity 1-morphisms only up to isomorphism. However, it turns out [6] that without loss of generality we may\nassume that g preserves identity 1-morphisms strictly. Thus we have gii (x) = 1\nfor all x \u2208 Ui . We may also assume hijk (x) = 1 whenever two or more of the\nindices i, j and k are equal. Finally, just as for the case of an ordinary topological group, we require that g is a continuous weak 2-functor We shall not\nspell this out in detail; suffice it to say that the maps gij : Ui \u2229 Uj \u2192 G and\nhijk : Ui \u2229 Uj \u2229 Uk \u2192 H should be continuous. We say such continuous weak\n2-functors g : \u00db \u2192 G are \u010cech 1-cocycles valued in G, subordinate to the cover\nU.\nWe now need to understand when two such cocycles should be considered\nequivalent. In the case of cohomology with coefficients in an ordinary topological\ngroup, we saw that two cocycles were cohomologous precisely when there was\na continuous natural isomorphism between the corresponding functors. In our\ncategorified setting we should instead use a 'weak natural isomorphism', also\ncalled a pseudonatural isomorphism [23]. So, we declare two cocycles to be\ncohomologous if there is a continuous weak natural isomorphism f : g \u21d2 g \u2032\nbetween the corresponding weak 2-functors g and g \u2032 .\nIn a weak natural isomorphism, the usual naturality square commutes only\nup to isomorphism. So, f : g \u21d2 g \u2032 not only sends every object (x, i) of \u00db to some\nfi (x) \u2208 G, but also sends every morphism (x, i) \u2192 (x, j) to some kij (x) \u2208 H\nfilling in this square:\ngij\n/\u2022\n\u2022\nfi\n\n\u000f\n\u2022\n\n\u007f\u007f\u007f\n{\u0003 \u007f\u007f\u007fkij\n\u2032\ngij\n\n14\n\nfj\n\n\u000f\n/\u2022\n\n\fTranslated into equations, this square says that\n\u2032\nt(kij )gij fj = fi gij\n\nThis is equation (3).\nThere is also a coherence law that the kij must satisfy: they must make the\nfollowing prism commute:\n\ngij\n\ngjk\n\nhijk\n\ngik\nfj\nkij\nkjk\n\nkik\nfi\n\nfk\n\n\u2032\ngij\n\n\u2032\ngjk\n\nh\u2032ijk\n\n(7)\n\u2032\ngik\nAt this point, translating the diagrams into equations becomes tiresome and\nunenlightening.\nIt can be shown that this notion of 'cohomologousness' of \u010cech 1-cocycles\ng : \u00db \u2192 G is an equivalence relation. We denote by \u021e 1 (U, G) the set of equivalence classes of cocycles obtained in this way. In other words, we let \u021e 1 (U, G)\nbe the set of continuous weak natural isomorphism classes of continuous weak\n2-functors g : \u00db \u2192 G.\nFinally, to define \u0124 1 (M, G), we need to take all covers into account as follows.\nThe set of all open covers of M is a directed set, partially ordered by refinement.\nBy restricting cocycles defined relative to U to any finer cover V, we obtain a\nmap \u021e 1 (U, G) \u2192 \u021e 1 (V, G). This allows us to define the \u010cech cohomology\n\u021e 1 (M, G) as a limit:\nDefinition 3. Given a topological space M and a topological 2-group G, we\ndefine the first \u010cech cohomology of M with coefficients in G to be\n\u021e 1 (M, G) = lim \u021e 1 (U, G)\n\u2212\u2192\nU\n\n15\n\n\fWhen we want to emphasize the crossed module, we will sometimes use the\nnotation \u021e 1 (M, H \u2192 G) instead of \u021e 1 (M, G). Note that \u021e 1 (M, G) is a pointed\nset, pointed by the trivial cocycle defined relative to any open cover {Ui } by\ngij = 1, hijk = 1 for all indices i, j and k.\nIn Theorem 1 we assume M admits good covers, so that every cover U of M\nhas a refinement by a good cover V. In other words, the directed set of good\ncovers of M is cofinal in the set of all covers of M . As a result, in computing\nthe limit above, it is sufficient to only consider good covers U.\nFinally, we remark that there is a more refined version of the set \u021e 1 (M, G)\ndefined using the notion of 'hypercover' [9, 11, 21]. For a paracompact space M\nthis refined cohomology set H 1 (M, G) is isomorphic to the set \u021e 1 (M, G) defined\nin terms of \u010cech covers. While the technology of hypercovers is certainly useful,\nand can simplify some proofs, our approach is sufficient for the applications\nwe have in mind (see also the remark following the proof of Lemma 2 in subsection 5.4).\n\n5\n5.1\n\nProofs\nProof of Theorem 1\n\nFirst, we need to distinguish between Milnor's [28] original construction of a\nclassifying space for a topological group and a later construction introduced by\nMilgram, Segal and Steenrod [27, 33, 36] and further studied by May [25]. Milnor's construction is very powerful, as witnessed by the generality of Theorem 0.\nThe later construction is conceptually more beautiful: for any topological group\nG, it constructs BG as the geometric realization of the nerve of the topological\ngroupoid with one object associated to G. But, here we are performing this\nconstruction in the category of k-spaces, rather than the traditional category of\ntopological spaces. It also seems to give a slightly weaker result: to obtain a\nbijection\n\u021e 1 (M, G) \u223c\n= [M, BG]\nall of the above cited works require some extra hypotheses on G: Segal [34]\nrequires that G be locally contractible; May, Milgram and Steenrod require that\nG be well pointed. This extra hypothesis on G is required in the construction\nof the universal principal G-bundle EG over BG; to ensure that the bundle is\nlocally trivial we must make one of the above assumptions on G. May's work\ngoes further in this regard: he proves that if G is well pointed then EG is a\nnumerable principal G-bundle over BG, and hence EG \u2192 BG is a Hurewicz\nfibration.\nAnother feature of this later construction is that EG comes equipped with\nthe structure of a topological group. In the work of May and Segal, this arises\nfrom the fact that EG is the geometric realization of the nerve of a topological 2group. We need the group structure on EG, so we will use this later construction\nrather than Milnor's. For further comparison of the constructions see tom Dieck\n[37].\n16\n\n\fWe prove Theorem 1 using three lemmas that are of some interest in their\nown right. The second, as far as we know, is due to Larry Breen:\nLemma 1. Let G be any well-pointed topological 2-group, and let (G, H, t, \u03b1) be\nthe corresponding topological crossed module. Then:\n1. |G| is a well-pointed topological group.\n2. There is a topological 2-group \u011c such that |\u011c| fits into a short exact sequence of topological groups\np\n\n1 \u2192 H \u2192 |\u011c| \u2192 |G| \u2192 1\n3. G acts continuously via automorphisms on the topological group EH, and\nthere is an isomorphism |\u011c| \u223c\n= G \u22c9 EH. This exhibits |G| as G \u22c9H EH,\nthe quotient of G \u22c9 EH by the normal subgroup H.\nLemma 2. If\np\n\nt\n\n1\u2192H \u2192G\u2192K\u21921\nis a short exact sequence of topological groups, there is a bijection\n\u021e 1 (M, H \u2192 G) \u223c\n= \u021e 1 (M, K)\nHere H \u2192 G is our shorthand for the 2-group corresponding to the crossed\nmodule (G, H, t, \u03b1) where t is the inclusion of the normal subgroup H in G and\n\u03b1 is the action of G by conjugation on H.\nLemma 3. If\np\n\nf\n\n1 \u2192 G0 \u2192 G1 \u2192 G2 \u2192 1\nis a short exact sequence of topological 2-groups, then\nf\u2217\n\np\u2217\n\n\u021e 1 (M, G0 ) \u2192 \u021e 1 (M, G1 ) \u2192 \u021e 1 (M, G2 )\nis an exact sequence of pointed sets.\nGiven these lemmas the proof of Theorem 1 goes as follows. Assume that\nG is a well-pointed topological 2-group. From Lemma 1 we see that |G| is a\nwell-pointed topological group. It follows that we have a bijection\n\u021e 1 (M, |G|) \u223c\n= [M, B|G|]\nSo, to prove the theorem, it suffices to construct a bijection\n\u021e 1 (M, G) \u223c\n= \u021e 1 (M, |G|)\nBy Lemma 1, |G| fits into a short exact sequence of topological groups:\n1 \u2192 H \u2192 G \u22c9 EH \u2192 |G| \u2192 1\n17\n\n\fWe can use Lemma 2 to conclude that there is a bijection\n\u021e 1 (M, H \u2192 G \u22c9 EH) \u223c\n= \u021e 1 (M, |G|)\nTo complete the proof it thus suffices to construct a bijection\n\u021e 1 (M, H \u2192 G \u22c9 EH) \u223c\n= \u021e 1 (M, G)\nFor this, observe that we have a short exact sequence of topological crossed\nmodules:\n1\n/1\n/H\n/H\n/1\n1\nt\n\n1\n\n\u000f\n/ EH\n\n\u000f\n\n\u000f\n/G\n\n/ G \u22c9 EH\n\n/1\n\nSo, by Lemma 3, we have an exact sequence of sets:\n\u021e 1 (M, EH) \u2192 \u021e 1 (M, H \u2192 G \u22c9 EH) \u2192 \u021e 1 (M, H \u2192 G)\nSince EH is contractible and M is paracompact Hausdorff, \u021e 1 (M, EH) is easily\nseen to be trivial, so the map \u021e 1 (M, H \u2192 G \u22c9 EH) \u2192 \u021e 1 (M, H \u2192 G) is\ninjective. To see that this map is surjective, note that there is a homomorphism\nof crossed modules going back:\n1\n\ny\n\n1\n\n/1\n\n/H\n\n1\n\n\u000f\n/ EH\n\n\u000f x\n/ G \u22c9 EH\n\n1\n\ni\n\n/H\n\n/1\n\nt\n\n\u000f\n/G\n\n/1\n\nwhere i is the natural inclusion of G in the semidirect product G \u22c9 EH. This\nhomomorphism going back 'splits' our exact sequence of crossed modules. It\nfollows that \u021e 1 (M, H \u2192 G \u22c9 EH) \u2192 \u021e 1 (M, H \u2192 G) is onto, so we have a\nbijection\n\u021e 1 (M, H \u2192 G \u22c9 EH) \u223c\n= \u021e 1 (M, H \u2192 G) = \u021e 1 (M, G)\ncompleting the proof.\n\n5.2\n\nRemarks on Theorem 1\n\nTheorem 1, asserting the existence of a classifying space for first \u010cech cohomology with coefficients in a topological 2-group, was originally stated in a\npreprint by Jur\u010do [22]. However, the argument given there was missing some\ndetails. In essence, the Jur\u010do's argument boils down to the following: he constructs a map \u021e 1 (M, |G|) \u2192 \u021e 1 (M, G) and sketches the construction of a map\n\u021e 1 (M, G) \u2192 \u021e 1 (M, |G|). The construction of the latter map however requires\nsome further justification: for instance, it is not obvious that one can choose a\n18\n\n\fclassifying map satisfying the cocycle property listed on the top of page 13 of\n[22]. Apart from this, it is not demonstrated that these two maps are inverses\nof each other.\nAs mentioned earlier, Jur\u010do and also Baas, B\u00f6kstedt and Kro [2] use a different approach to construct a classifying space for a topological 2-group G.\nIn their approach, G is regarded as a topological 2-groupoid with one object.\nThere is a well-known nerve construction that turns any 2-groupoid (or even\nany 2-category) into a simplicial set [15]. Internalizing this construction, these\nauthors turn the topological 2-groupoid G into a simplicial space, and then take\nthe geometric realization of that to obtain a space. Let us denote this space\nby BG. This is the classifying space used by Jur\u010do and Baas\u2013B\u00f6kstedt\u2013Kro. It\nshould be noted that the assumption that G is a well-pointed 2-group ensures\nthat the nerve of the 2-groupoid G is a 'good' simplicial space in the sense of\nSegal; this 'goodness' condition is important in the work of Baas, B\u00f6kstedt and\nKro [2].\nBaas, B\u00f6kstedt and Kro also consider a third way to construct a classifying\nspace for G. If we take the nerve N G of G we get a simplicial group, as described\nin Section 3 above. By thinking of each group of p-simplices (N G)p as a groupoid\nwith one object, we can think of N G as a simplicial groupoid. From N G we can\nobtain a bisimplicial space N N G by applying the nerve construction to each\ngroupoid (N G)p . N N G is sometimes called the 'double nerve', since we apply\nthe nerve construction twice. From this bisimplicial space N N G we can form an\nordinary simplicial space dN N G by taking the diagonal. Taking the geometric\nrealization of this simplicial space, we obtain a space |dN N G|.\nIt turns out that this space |dN N G| is homeomorphic to B|G| [8, 30]. It can\nalso be shown that the spaces |dN N G| and BG are homotopy equivalent - but\nalthough this fact seems well-known to experts, we have been unable to find a\nreference in the case of a topological 2-group G. For ordinary 2-groups (without\ntopology) the relation between all three nerves was worked out by Moerdijk and\nSvensson [29] and Bullejos and Cegarra [13]. In any case, since we do not use\nthese facts in our arguments, we forgo providing the proofs here.\n\n5.3\n\nProof of Lemma 1\n\nSuppose G is a well-pointed topological 2-group with topological crossed module\n(G, H, t, \u03b1), and let |G| be the geometric realization of its nerve. We shall\nprove that there is a topological 2-group \u011c fitting into a short exact sequence\nof topological 2-groups\n1 \u2192 H \u2192 \u011c \u2192 G \u2192 1\n(8)\nwhere H is the discrete topological 2-group associated to the topological group\nH. On taking nerves and then geometric realizations, this gives an exact sequence of groups:\n1 \u2192 H \u2192 |\u011c| \u2192 |G| \u2192 1\nRedescribing the 2-group \u011c with the help of some work by Segal, we shall show\nthat |\u011c| \u223c\n= (G \u22c9 EH)/H. Then we prove that the above\n= G \u22c9 EH and thus |G| \u223c\n19\n\n\fsequence is an exact sequence of topological groups: this requires checking that\n|\u011c| \u2192 |G| is a Hurewicz fibration. We conclude by showing that |\u011c| is wellpointed.\nTo build the exact sequence of 2-groups in equation (8), we construct the\ncorresponding exact sequence of topological crossed modules. This takes the\nfollowing form:\n1\n\n/1\n\n1\n\n\u000f\n/H\n\n/H\n\n1\n\n/H\n\nt\u2032\nf\n\n\u000f\n/ G\u22c9H\n\n/1\n\nt\nf\u2032\n\n\u000f\n/G\n\n/1\n\nHere the crossed module (G \u22c9 H, H, t\u2032 , \u03b1\u2032 ) is defined as follows:\nt\u2032 (h) = (1, h)\n\u03b1\u2032 (g, h)(h\u2032 ) = \u03b1(t(h)g)(h\u2032 )\nwhile f and f \u2032 are given by\nf: H\nh\n\n\u2192 G\u22c9H\n7\u2192 (t(h), h\u22121 )\n\nf\u2032 : G \u22c9 H \u2192 G\n(g, h) 7\u2192 t(h)g\nIt is easy to check that these formulas define an exact sequence of topological\ncrossed modules. The corresponding exact sequence of topological 2-groups is\n1 \u2192 H \u2192 \u011c \u2192 G \u2192 1\nwhere \u011c denotes the topological 2-group associated to the topological crossed\nmodule (G \u22c9 H, H, t\u2032 , \u03b1\u2032 ).\nIn more detail, the 2-group \u011c has\nOb(\u011c) = G \u22c9 H\nMor(\u011c) = (G \u22c9 H) \u22c9 H\ns((g, h), h\u2032 ) = (g, h),\ni(g, h) = ((g, h), 1),\n\nt((g, h), h\u2032 ) = (g, h\u2032 h)\n((g, h\u2032 h), h\u2032\u2032 ) \u25e6 ((g, h), h\u2032 ) = ((g, h), h\u2032\u2032 h\u2032 )\n\nNote that there is an isomorphism (G \u22c9 H) \u22c9 H \u223c\n= G \u22c9 H 2 sending ((g, h), h\u2032 )\n\u2032\n2\nto (g, (h, h h)). Here by G \u22c9 H we mean the semidirect product formed with\nthe diagonal action of G on H 2 , namely g(h, h\u2032 ) = (\u03b1(g)(h), \u03b1(g)(h\u2032 )). Thus\nthe group Mor(\u011c) is isomorphic to G \u22c9 H 2 .\nWe can give a clearer description of the 2-group \u011c using the work of Segal\n[33]. Segal noted that for any topological group H, there is a 2-group H with\n\n20\n\n\fone object for each element of H, and one morphism from any object to any\nother. In other words, H is the 2-group with:\nOb(H) = H\nMor(H) = H 2\ns(h, h\u2032 ) = h,\ni(h) = (h, h),\n\nt(h, h\u2032 ) = h\u2032\n(h\u2032 , h\u2032\u2032 ) \u25e6 (h, h\u2032 ) = (h, h\u2032\u2032 )\n\nMoreover, Segal proved that the geometric realization |H| of the nerve of H\nis a model for EH. Since G acts on H by automorphisms, we can define a\n'semidirect product' 2-group G \u22c9 H with\nOb(G \u22c9 H) = G \u22c9 H\nMor(G \u22c9 H) = G \u22c9 H 2\ns(g, (h, h\u2032 )) = (g, h),\nt(g, (h, h\u2032 )) = (g, h\u2032 )\n(g, (h\u2032 , h\u2032\u2032 )) \u25e6 (g, (h, h\u2032 )) = (g, (h, h\u2032\u2032 ))\n\ni(g, h) = (g, (h, h)),\n\nThe isomorphism (G \u22c9 H) \u22c9 H \u223c\n= G \u22c9 H 2 above can then be interpreted as an\n\u223c\nisomorphism Mor(\u011c) = Mor(G\u22c9H). It is easy to check that this isomorphism is\ncompatible with the structure maps for \u011c and G\u22c9H, so we have an isomorphism\nof topological 2-groups:\n\u011c \u223c\n=G\u22c9H\nIt follows that the nerve N \u011c of \u011c is isomorphic as a simplicial topological group\nto the nerve of G\u22c9H. As a simplicial space it is clear that N (G\u22c9H) = G\u00d7N H.\nWe need to identify the simplicial group structure on G \u00d7 N H.\nFrom the definition of the products on Ob(G \u22c9 H) and Mor(G \u22c9 H), it is\nclear that the product on N (G \u22c9 H) is given by the simplicial map\n(G \u00d7 N H) \u00d7 (G \u00d7 N H) \u2192 G \u00d7 N H\ndefined on p-simplices by\n\u0001\n(g, (h1 , . . . , hp )), (g \u2032 , (h\u20321 , . . . , h\u2032p )) 7\u2192 (gg \u2032 , (h1 \u03b1(g)(h\u20321 ), . . . , hp \u03b1(g)(h\u2032p )))\n\nThus one might well call N (G \u22c9 H) the 'semidirect product' G \u22c9 N H. Since\ngeometric realization preserves products, it follows that there is an isomorphism\nof topological groups\n|\u011c| \u223c\n= G \u22c9 EH.\nHere the semidirect product is formed using the action of G on EH induced\nfrom the action of G on H. Finally note that H is embedded as a normal\nsubgroup of G \u22c9 EH through\nH\nh\n\n\u2192 G \u22c9 EH\n7\u2192 (t(h), h\u22121 )\n\n21\n\n\fIt follows that the exact sequence of groups 1 \u2192 H \u2192 |\u011c| \u2192 |G| \u2192 1 can be\nidentified with\n1 \u2192 H \u2192 G \u22c9 EH \u2192 |G| \u2192 1\n(9)\nIt follows that |G| is isomorphic to the quotient G \u22c9H EH of G \u22c9 EH by the\nnormal subgroup H. This amounts to factoring out by the action of H on\nG \u22c9 EH given by h(g, x) = (t(h)g, xh\u22121 ).\nNext we need to show that equation (9) specifies an exact sequence of topological groups: in particular, that the map G \u22c9 EH \u2192 |G| = G \u22c9H EH is\na Hurewicz fibration. To do this, we prove that the following diagram is a\npullback:\n/ EH\nG \u22c9 EH\n\u000f\nG \u22c9H EH\n\n\u000f\n/ BH\n\nSince H is well pointed, EH \u2192 BH is a numerable principal bundle (and hence a\nHurewicz fibration) by the results of May [25] referred to earlier. The statement\nabove now follows, as Hurewicz fibrations are preserved under pullbacks.\nTo show the above diagram is a pullback, we construct a homeomorphism\n\u03b1 : (G \u22c9H EH) \u00d7BH EH \u2192 G \u22c9 EH\nwhose inverse is the canonical map \u03b2 : G \u22c9 EH \u2192 (G \u22c9H EH) \u00d7BH EH. To do\nthis, suppose that ([g, x], y) \u2208 (G \u22c9H EH) \u00d7BH EH. Then x and y belong to\nthe same fiber of EH over BH, so y \u22121 x \u2208 H. We set\n\u03b1([g, x], y) = (t(y \u22121 x)g, y)\nA straightforward calculation shows that \u03b1 is well defined and that \u03b1 and \u03b2 are\ninverse to one another.\nTo conclude, we need to show that |G| is a well-pointed topological group.\nFor this it is sufficient to show that N G is a 'proper' simplicial space in the sense\nof May [26] (note that we can replace his 'strong' NDR`\npairs with NDR pairs).\np\nFor, if we follow May and denote by Fp |G| the image of i=0 \u2206i \u00d7 N Gi in |G|, it\nthen follows from his Lemma 11.3 that (|G|, Fp |G|) is an NDR pair for all p. In\nparticular (|G|, F0 |G|) is an NDR pair. Since F0 |G| = G and (G, 1) is an NDR\npair, it follows that (|G|, 1) is an NDR pair: that is, |G| is well pointed.\nWe still need to show that N G is proper. In fact it suffices to show that\nN G is a 'good' simplicial space in the sense of Segal [35], meaning that all the\ndegeneracies si : N Gn \u2192 N Gn+1 are closed cofibrations. The reason for this\nis that every good simplicial space is automatically proper - see the proof of\nLewis' Corollary 2.4(b) [16]. To see that N G is good, note that every degeneracy\nhomomorphism si : N Gn \u2192 N Gn+1 is a section of the corresponding face homomorphism di , so N Gn+1 splits as a semidirect product N Gn+1 \u223c\n= N Gn \u22c9 ker(di ).\nTherefore, si is a closed cofibration provided that ker(di ) is well pointed. But\nker(di ) is a retract of N Gn+1 , so ker(di ) will be well pointed if N Gn+1 is well\n22\n\n\fpointed. For this, note that N Gn+1 is isomorphic as a space to G \u00d7 H n+1 . Since\nthe groups G and H are well pointed by hypothesis, it follows that N Gn+1 is\nwell pointed. Here we have used the fact that if X \u2192 Y and X \u2032 \u2192 Y \u2032 are closed\ncofibrations then X \u00d7 X \u2032 \u2192 Y \u00d7 Y \u2032 is a closed cofibration.\n\n5.4\n\nProof of Lemma 2\n\nSuppose that M is a topological space admitting good covers. Also suppose\np\nt\nthat 1 \u2192 H \u2192 G \u2192 K \u2192 1 is an exact sequence of topological groups.\nt\nThis data gives rise to a topological crossed module H \u2192 G where G acts\non H by conjugation. For short we denote this by H \u2192 G. The same data also\ngives a topological crossed module 1 \u2192 K. There is a homomorphism of crossed\nmodules from H \u2192 G to 1 \u2192 K, arising from this commuting square:\n/1\n\nH\nt\n\n\u000f\nG\n\np\n\n\u000f\n/K\n\nCall this homomorphism \u03b1. It yields a map\n\u03b1\u2217 : \u021e 1 (M, H \u2192 G) \u2192 \u021e 1 (M, 1 \u2192 K).\nNote that \u021e 1 (M, 1 \u2192 K) is just the ordinary \u010cech cohomology \u021e 1 (M, K). To\nprove Lemma 2, we need to construct an inverse\n\u03b2 : \u021e 1 (M, K) \u2192 \u021e 1 (M, H \u2192 G).\nLet U = {Ui } be a good cover of M ; then, as noted in Section 4 there is a\nbijection\n\u021e 1 (M, K) = \u021e 1 (U, K)\nHence to define the map \u03b2 it is sufficient to define a map \u03b2 : \u021e 1 (U, K) \u2192\n\u021e 1 (U, H \u2192 G). Let kij be a K-valued \u010cech 1-cocycle subordinate to U. Then\nfrom it we construct a \u010cech 1-cocycle (gij , hijk ) taking values in H \u2192 G as\nfollows. Since the spaces Ui \u2229 Uj are contractible and p : G \u2192 K is a Hurewicz\nfibration, we can lift the maps kij : Ui \u2229 Uj \u2192 K to maps gij : Ui \u2229 Uj \u2192 G.\nThe gij need not satisfy the cocycle condition for ordinary \u010cech cohomology,\nbut instead we have\nt(hijk )gij gjk = gik\nfor some unique hijk : Ui \u2229 Uj \u2229 Uk \u2192 H. In terms of diagrams, this means we\nhave triangles\nF \u2022 11\n11\n11\ngij\n11gjk\nhijk\n11\n11\n\u0013\n\u0018\n/\u2022\n\u2022\ngik\n23\n\n\fThe uniqueness of hijk follows from the fact that the homomorphism t : H \u2192 G\nis injective. To show that the pair (gij , hijk ) defines a \u010cech cocycle we need\nto check that the tetrahedron (6) commutes. However, this follows from the\ncommutativity of the corresponding tetrahedron built from triangles of this\nform:\nF \u2022 11\n11\n11\nkij\n11kjk\n11\n1\n11\n\u0013\n\u0018\n/\u2022\n\u2022\nkik\n\nand the injectivity of t.\nLet us show that this construction gives a well-defined map\n\u03b2 : \u021e 1 (M, K) = \u021e 1 (U, K) \u2192 \u021e 1 (M, H \u2192 G)\n\u2032\nsending [kij ] to [gij , hijk ]. Suppose that kij\nis another K-valued \u010cech 1-cocycle\n\u2032\nsubordinate to U, such that kij and kij are cohomologous. Starting from the\n\u2032\n\u2032\ncocycle kij\nwe can construct (in the same manner as above) a cocycle (gij\n, h\u2032ijk )\n\u2032\n\u2032\ntaking values in H \u2192 G. Our task is to show that (gij , hijk ) and (gij , hijk ) are\n\u2032\ncohomologous. Since kij and kij\nare cohomologous there exists a family of maps\n\u03bai : Ui \u2192 K fitting into the naturality square\n\n\u2022\n\nkij (x)\n\n/\u2022\n\u03baj (x)\n\n\u03bai (x)\n\n\u000f\n\u2022\n\n\u2032\nkij\n(x)\n\n\u000f\n/\u2022\n\n\u2032\nChoose lifts fi : Ui \u2192 G of the various \u03bai . Since p(gij ) = p(gij\n) = kij and\np(fi ) = \u03bai , p(fj ) = \u03baj there is a unique map \u03b7ij : Ui \u2229 Uj \u2192 H\n\u2032\nt(\u03b7ij )gij fj = fi gij\n.\n\nSo, in terms of diagrams, we have the following squares:\n\u2022\n\ngij\n\n/\u2022\n\u0002\u0002\n\u0002\n\u0002\n\u03b7ij \u0002\u0002\u0002\nfj\nfi\n\u0002\u0002\u0002\n\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\n\u0002\n\u000f |\u0004 \u0002\n\u000f\n/\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2032\ngij\n\nThe triangles and squares defined so far fit together to form prisms:\n\n24\n\n\fgij\n\ngjk\n\nhijk\n\ngik\nfj\n\u03b7ij\n\u03b7jk\n\n\u03b7ik\nfi\n\nfk\n\n\u2032\ngjk\n\n\u2032\ngij\n\nh\u2032ijk\n\u2032\ngik\nIt follows from the injectivity of the homomorphism t that these prisms com\u2032\nmute, and therefore that (gij , hijk ) and (gij\n, h\u2032ijk ) are cohomologous. Therefore\nwe have a well-defined map \u021e 1 (U, K) \u2192 \u021e 1 (U, H \u2192 G) and hence a welldefined map \u03b2 : \u021e 1 (M, K) \u2192 \u021e 1 (M, H \u2192 G).\nFinally we need to check that \u03b1 and \u03b2 are inverse to one another. It is\nobvious that \u03b1 \u25e6 \u03b2 is the identity on \u021e 1 (M, K). To see that \u03b2 \u25e6 \u03b1 is the identity\non \u021e 1 (M, H \u2192 G) we argue as follows. Choose a cocycle (gij , hijk ) subordinate\nto a good cover U = {Ui }. Then under \u03b1 the cocycle [gij , hijk ] is sent to the\nK-valued cocycle [p(gij )]. But then we may take gij as our lift of p(gij ) in the\ndefinition of \u03b2(p(gij )). It is then clear that (\u03b2 \u25e6 \u03b1)[gij , hijk ] = [gij , hijk ].\n\nAt this point a remark is in order. The proof of the above lemma is one\nplace where the definition of \u021e 1 (M, H \u2192 G) in terms of hypercovers would lead\nto simplifications, and would allow us to replace the hypothesis that the map\nunderlying the homomorphism G \u2192 K was a fibration with a less restrictive\ncondition. The homomorphism of crossed modules\n/1\nH\nt\n\n\u000f\nG\n\np\n\n\u000f\n/K\n\ngives a homomorphism between the associated 2-groups and hence a simplicial\nmap between the nerves of the associated 2-groupoids. It turns out that this\n25\n\n\fsimplicial map belongs to a certain class of simplicial maps with respect to which\na subcategory of simplicial spaces is localized. In the formalism of hypercovers,\nfor M paracompact, the nonabelian cohomology \u021e 1 (M, G) with coefficients in a\n2-group G is defined as a certain set of morphisms in this localized subcategory.\nIt is then easy to see that the induced map \u021e 1 (M, H \u2192 G) \u2192 \u021e 1 (M, K) is a\nbijection.\n\n5.5\n\nProof of Lemma 3\n\nSuppose that\np\n\nf\n\n1 \u2192 G0 \u2192 G1 \u2192 G2 \u2192 1\nis a short exact sequence of topological 2-groups, so that we have a short exact\nsequence of topological crossed modules:\n1\n\u000f\n1\n\n/ H0\n\nf\n\n/ H1\n\nt0\n\nt1\n\n\u000f\n/ G0\n\n\u000f\n/ G1\n\nf\n\np\n\n/ H2\n\n/1\n\nt2\np\n\n\u000f\n/ G2\n\n\u000f\n/1\n\nAlso suppose that U = {Ui } is a good cover of M , and that (gij , hijk ) is a\ncocycle representing a class in \u021e 1 (U, G1 ). We claim that the image of\nf\u2217 : \u021e 1 (M, G0 ) \u2192 \u021e 1 (M, G1 )\nequals the kernel of\np\u2217 : \u021e 1 (M, G1 ) \u2192 \u021e 1 (M, G2 ).\nIf the class [gij , hijk ] is in the image of f\u2217 , it is clearly in the kernel of p\u2217 .\nConversely, suppose it is in kernel of p\u2217 . We need to show that it is in the image\nof f\u2217 .\nThe pair (p(gij ), p(hijk )) is cohomologous to the trivial cocycle, at least after\nrefining the cover U, so there exist xi : Ui \u2192 G2 and \u03beij : Ui \u2229 Uj \u2192 H2 such\nthat this diagram commutes:\n\n26\n\n\fp(gij )\n\np(gjk )\n\np(hijk )\n\np(gik )\nxj\n\u03beij\n\u03bejk\n\n\u03beik\nxi\n\nxk\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\nSince p : G1 \u2192 G2 is a fibration and Ui is contractible, we can lift xi to a\nmap x\u0302i : Ui \u2192 G1 . Similarly, we can lift \u03beij to a map \u03be\u02c6ij : Ui \u2229 Uj \u2192 H1 . There\nare then unique maps \u03b3ij : Ui \u2229 Uj \u2192 G1 giving squares like this:\ngij\n\n/\u2022\n\u0002\n\u0002\n\u0002\n\u03be\u0302ij \u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\n\u0002\nx\u0302j\nx\u0302i\n\u0002\u0002\u0002\u0002\n\u0002\n\u0002\n\u000f |\u0004 \u0002\u0002\n\u000f\n\u2022 \u03b3ij / \u2022\n\u2022\n\nnamely\n\n\u02c6\n\u03b3ij = x\u0302i gij x\u0302\u22121\nj t(\u03beij )\n\nSimilarly, there are unique maps cijk : Ui \u2229 Uj \u2229 Uk \u2192 H1 making this prism\ncommute:\n\n27\n\n\fgij\n\ngjk\n\nhijk\n\ngik\nx\u0302j\n\u03be\u0302ij\n\u03be\u0302jk\n\n\u03be\u0302ik\nx\u0302i\n\nx\u0302k\n\n\u03b3ij\n\n\u03b3jk\n\ncijk\n\n\u03b3ik\nTo define cijk , we simply compose the 2-morphisms on the sides and top of the\nprism.\nApplying p to the prism above we obtain the previous prism. So, \u03b3ij and cijk\nmust take values in the kernel of p : G1 \u2192 G2 and p : H1 \u2192 H2 , respectively. It\nfollows that \u03b3ij and cijk take values in the image of f .\nThe above prism says that (\u03b3ij , cijk ) is cohomologous to (gij , hijk ), and\ntherefore a cocycle in its own right. Since \u03b3ij and cijk take values in the image\nof f , they represent a class in the image of\nf\u2217 : \u021e 1 (M, G0 ) \u2192 \u021e 1 (M, G1 ).\nSo, [gij , hijk ] = [\u03b3ij , cijk ] is in the image of f\u2217 , as was to be shown.\n\nProof of Theorem 2\nThe following proof was first described to us by Matt Ando [1], and later discussed by Greg Ginot [17].\nSuppose that G is a simply-connected, compact, simple Lie group. Then the\nstring group \u011c of G fits into a short exact sequence of topological groups\n1 \u2192 K(Z, 2) \u2192 \u011c \u2192 G \u2192 1\nfor some realization of the Eilenberg-Mac Lane space K(Z, 2) as a topological\ngroup. Applying the classifying space functor B to this short exact sequence\n28\n\n\fgives rise to a fibration\n\np\n\nK(Z, 3) \u2192 B \u011c \u2192 BG.\nWe want to compute the rational cohomology of B \u011c.\nWe can use the Serre spectral sequence to compute H \u2217 (B \u011c, Q). Since BG\nis simply connected the E2 term of this spectral sequence is\nE2p,q = H p (BG, Q) \u2297 H q (K(Z, 3), Q).\nBecause K(Z, 3) is rationally indistinguishable from S 3 , the first nonzero differential is d4 . Furthermore, the differentials of this spectral sequence are all\nderivations. It follows that d4 (y \u2297 x3 ) = (\u22121)p y \u2297 d4 (x3 ) if y \u2208 H p (BG, Q).\nIt is not hard to identify d4 (x3 ) with c, the class in H 4 (BG, Q) which is the\ntransgression of the generator \u03bd of H 3 (G, Q) = Q. It follows that the spectral\nsequence collapses at the E5 stage with\n(\n0\nif q > 0\np,q\np,q\nE5 = E\u221e =\nH p (BG, Q)/hci if q = 0.\nOne checks that all the subcomplexes F i H \u2217 (B \u011c, Q) in the filtration of H \u2217 (B \u011c, Q)\np,0\nare zero for i \u2265 1. Hence H p (B \u011c, Q) = E\u221e\n= H p (BG, Q)/hci and so Theorem\n2 is proved.\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank Matthew Ando and Greg Ginot for showing us the proof\nof Theorem 2, Peter May for helpful remarks on classifying spaces, and Toby\nBartels, Branislav Jur\u010do, and Urs Schreiber for many discussions on higher gauge\ntheory.
