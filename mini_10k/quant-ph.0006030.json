China.\nNovember 10, 2018\n\nAbstract\nA theoretical scheme for controlled quantum teleportation is presented,\nusing the entanglement property of GHZ state.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the field of quantum computation and communication, quantum channel plays\nan important role. In 1993, Bennet et.al.[1] presented the theory of quantum\nteleportation, which provides a theoretical basis for the construction of quantum\nchannels. The first experiment of quantum teleportation was accomplished by\nBoumeester et.al.[2] in 1997, which was generally acknowledged as a milestone\nin the field of quantum information. In that work, the technique of Bell-state\nanalysis[3, 4] was utilized. In 1999, the first three-photon entangle state(GHZ\nstate[5] ) was experimentally realized[6, 7] .\nIn this paper, the entanglement property of GHZ state is utilized to design\na theoretical scheme for controlled quantum teleportation. According to the\nscheme, a third side is included, so that the quantum channel is supervised by\nthis additional side. The signal state cannot be transmitted unless all three sides\nagree to cooperate.\n\u2217\n\nThe project supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China.\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nControlled quantum teleportation\n\nSuppose Alice, Bob and Charlie share a GHZ state[5] ,\n1\n|\u03c8iABC = \u221a (|000i + |111i)ABC\n2\nand Alice is to teleport an unknown signal state to Bob. The signal was originally\ncarried by qubit D,\n|\u03c8iD = \u03b1 |0iD + \u03b2 |1iD\nThe state for the whole system(four qubits) can be expressed as:\n\n1\n|\u03c8iDABC = (\u03b1 |0i + \u03b2 |1i)D \u2297 \u221a (|000i + |111i)ABC\n2\n1 1\n=\n* \u221a (|00i + |11i)DA \u2297 (\u03b1 |00i + \u03b2 |11i)BC\n2\n2\n1 1\n+ * \u221a (|00i \u2212 |11i)DA \u2297 (\u03b1 |00i \u2212 \u03b2 |11i)BC\n2\n2\n1 1\n+ * \u221a (|01i + |10i)DA \u2297 (\u03b2 |00i + \u03b1 |11i)BC\n2\n2\n1 1\n+ * \u221a (|01i \u2212 |10i)DA \u2297 (\u2212\u03b2 |00i + \u03b1 |11i)BC\n2\n2\nNow Alice perform a Bell-state measurement[3, 4] on qubits DA. After that,\nshe will broadcast the result of her measurement, so that qubits BC can be transformed(According to the four possible results \u221a12 (|00i + |11i)DA , \u221a12 (|00i \u2212 |11i)DA ,\n\u221a1 (|01i + |10i)\n\u221a1\nDA and 2 (|01i \u2212 |10i)DA , the corresponding transformations are\n2\nIB \u2297IC , IB \u2297(|0i h0| \u2212 |1i h1|)C , (|0i h1| + |1i h0|)B \u2297(|0i h1| + |1i h0|)C and (|0i h1| + |1i h0|)B \u2297\n(|0i h1| \u2212 |1i h0|)C , respectively.) by Bob and/or Charlie to a common form:\n|\u03c8iBC = (\u03b1 |00i + \u03b2 |11i)BC\nConsidering this state, we can see that, at this moment, neither Bob nor\nCharlie can obtain the original signal state \u03b1 |0i + \u03b2 |1i without the cooperation\nof the other one.\nIf Charlie would like to help Bob for the teleportation, he should just measure his portion of BC, namely qubit C, on the bases of \u221a12 (|0i + |1i)C and\n\u221a1 (|0i \u2212 |1i) , and transfer the result of his measurement to Bob via a classical\nC\n2\nchannel. Here the state of qubits BC can be written as:\n|\u03c8iBC = (\u03b1 |00i + \u03b2 |11i)BC\n1\n1\n= \u221a * (\u03b1 |0i + \u03b2 |1i)B \u2297 \u221a (|0i + |1i)C\n2\n2\n1\n1\n+ \u221a * (\u03b1 |0i \u2212 \u03b2 |1i)B \u2297 \u221a (|0i \u2212 |1i)C\n2\n2\n2\n\n\fAs soon as Bob is informed Charlie's result, he can perform an appropriate\nunitary transformation(According to the two possible results \u221a12 (|0i + |1i)C and\n\u221a1 (|0i \u2212 |1i) , the corresponding transformations are IB and (|0i h0| \u2212 |1i h1|) ,\nC\nB\n2\nrespectively.) on qubit B to obtain the original signal state,\n|\u03c8iB = \u03b1 |0iB + \u03b2 |1iB\nThe feature of this scheme is that teleportation between two sides depends\non the agreement of the third side. It is therefore named \"Controlled Quantum\nTeleportation\".\n\n3\n\nConclusion\n\nThe difference of the scheme presented in this paper with the original quantum teleportation scheme[1] is that a third side(Charlie) is included, who may\nparticipate the process of quantum teleportation as a supervisor. Without the\ncooperation(permission) of Charlie, Bob cannot get the signal state from Alice\nby himself.\nThis property of the scheme can be utilized to construct controlled quantum\nchannels, which may be useful in the future quantum computers.\n\nReferences\n[1] C.H.
