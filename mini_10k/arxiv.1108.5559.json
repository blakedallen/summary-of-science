Under the effect of even simple optical\ncomponents, the spatial properties of these beams can vary over the duration of the light pulse [1].\nIn this letter, we show how such spatio-temporally coupled electromagnetic fields can be exploited\nto produce an attosecond lighthouse, i.e. a source emitting a collection of isolated attosecond pulses,\npropagating in angularly well-separated light beams. This very general effect not only opens the way\nto a new generation of attosecond light sources, particularly suitable for pump-probe experiments,\nbut also provides a powerful new tool for ultrafast metrology, for instance giving direct access to\nfluctuations in the phase of the laser field oscillations with respect to the pulse envelop, right at the\nfocus of even the most intense ultrashort laser beams.\nPACS numbers:\n\nTo demonstrate this idea, we consider a particular\napplication of STC to attosecond pulse generation (1\nas=10\u221218 s), which has been the key issue in the development of attosecond Science [4]. All attosecond light\nsources demonstrated so far are based on high-order\nharmonic generation (HHG) of intense femtosecond laser pulses in different media [4, 5]. Since many-cycle\nlong pulses naturally produce trains of attosecond pulses,\nconsiderable efforts had to be deployed in the last fifteen years for the development of 'temporal gating' techniques, to isolate single attosecond pulses, more readily\nusable for time-resolved measurements of electron dynamics in matter. A variety of experimentally-challenging\ntechniques have now been demonstrated for HHG in gases\n[6, 7]. In contrast, the problem is still unsolved experimentally for HHG on plasma mirrors [8\u201310], one of the\npromising processes to obtain the next generation of attosecond light sources [11, 12]. We describe here how STC\nprovide a new approach to this problem, of unprecedented simplicity, generality and potential : one of the most\nbasic types of STC, wavefront rotation [1] (WFR), can\nbe exploited to generate a collection of single attosecond\npulses in angularly well-separated light beams -an attosecond lighthouse- even with relatively long laser pulses.\nLet us first briefly summarize the concept of WFR at\nthe focus of a femtosecond laser beam.

The importance\nof STC has been largely overlooked in most laser-matter\ninteraction experiments, until recently [2]. In strong-field\nscience, STC are even considered as highly detrimental,\nbecause they systematically decrease the peak intensity\nat focus [3]. In this letter, we show that on the opposite, moderate and controlled STC provide a powerful\nmeans of controlling high-intensity laser-matter interactions, and pave the way to a whole range of new experimental capabilities.\n\nPosition xi / \u03bb L\n\narXiv:1108.5559v1 [physics.optics] 29 Aug 2011\n\nCEA, IRAMIS, Service des Photons Atomes et Mol\u00e9cules, F-91191 Gif-sur-Yvette, France\n\n-6\n0,9\n\n1\n\n\u03c9 / \u03c9L\n\n1,1\n\n-10\n\n0\nt / TL\n\n10\n\nFigure 1: Pulse front tilt and wavefront rotation of\na femtosecond laser beam.

Laser pulse of duration before focusing \u03c4i = 25 f s,\nwith wi = 70 mm, f = 200 mm, \u03be = \u03c4i /wi = 0.36 f s/mm,\nleading to wf = 2.6\u03bbL and \u03c4f = 35 f s and vr = 7 mrad/f s.\nThese parameters are typical of a state-of-the-art high-power\nfemtosecond laser.\n\nSTC takes a different form, called pulse front tilt [1],\nwhich corresponds to an E-field of the form (assuming\nGaussian profiles in time and space) :\n!\n\u00152\n\u0014\nx2i\nt \u2212 \u03bexi\n\u2212 2 2 \u00d7 exp (i\u03c9L t)\nE(xi , t) = E0 exp \u22122\n\u03c4i\nwi\n(1)\nwhere xi is one of the transverse spatial coordinate, \u03c4i is\nthe Fourier-transform limited pulse duration at a given\nposition in the beam, wi the beam diameter before focusing, \u03be the pulse front tilt parameter, and \u03c9L the laser\ncentral frequency. All widths are defined as full widths at\n1/e of the intensity profile. Pulse front tilt occurs whene-\n\n\f2\nver \u03be 6= 0, i.e. when the line formed by the pulse maxima\nin the (xi , t) space -the pulse front- is tilted with respect\nto the wavefronts (see Fig. 1(a) and (b)).\nFor instance, pulse-front tilt can be induced upon diffraction on a grating [13] : since the incidence angle \u03b1i\nand diffraction angle \u03b1d are not equal (Fig. 1(a)), the\naccumulated optical path length varies with transverse\ncoordinate xi , resulting in a varying delay between the\nwavefront and pulse front across the beam. In ChirpedPulse Amplification lasers, residual pulse front tilt thus\noccurs whenever some of the gratings used in the compressor are not exactly parallel (see Fig. 1(a)).\nThis example provides a straightforward way of understanding the E-field configuration once a beam with\ninitial pulse front tilt is focused. Indeed, a grating followed by a focusing element acts as spectrometer. At focus,\nsuch a beam thus presents a spectrum which depends on\nspace (see Supplementary Information), as illustrated in\nFig. 1(c). This effect is known as spatial chirp in the\n(xf , \u03c9) space , where xf is the transverse spatial coordinate at focus, and \u03c9 the light frequency. As \u03be increases,\nthe focal spot becomes more and more elliptical, with\na long axis along the direction of spatial chirp (see Fig.\n1(c)).\nIn the (xf , t) domain, such a spatial chirp implies that\nthe time spacing between successive wavefronts varies\nwith the transverse coordinate xf : as a result, the wavefronts rotate in time (see Fig. 1(d)). Indeed, Fouriertransforming Eq.(1) with respect to xi leads to the field\n\u1ebc(xf , t) at the focus of an optics of focal length f :\n!\nx2f\nt2\n\u1ebc(xf , t) \u221d exp \u22122 2 \u2212 2 2 \u00d7 exp(i\u03c6(xf , t))\n\u03c4f\nwf\n\u03c6(xf , t) = 4\n\nwi \u03be\nxf t + \u03c9L t\nwf \u03c4f \u03c4i\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the pulse duration at focus, \u03c4f , and the effective\nbeam waist along the xf axis, wf , are given by\np\n\u03c4f = \u03c4i 1 + (wi \u03be/\u03c4i )2\np\nwf = w0 1 + (wi \u03be/\u03c4i )2\n(3)\n\nwith w0 = 2(\u03bbf /\u03c0wi ) the usual beam waist at focus when\n\u03be = 0. The instantaneous direction of propagation of light\n\u03b2 is given by \u03b2 \u2248 k\u22a5 /kL , where kL = \u03c9L /c is the laser\nwave vector, and k\u22a5 = \u2202\u03c6/\u2202xf its transverse component.\nThe xf t term in \u03c6 implies that \u03b2, and hence the instantaneous wavefront direction, vary in time, with a rotation\nvelocity vr = d\u03b2/dt deduced from Eq. (2) :\nvr =\n\n\u03be\nwi2\nf \u03c4i2 1 + (wi \u03be/\u03c4i )2\n\n(4)\n\nFor given duration \u03c4i and numerical aperture \u03b8L = wi /f\nof the beam, vr reaches its maximum possible value\nvrmax = wi /2f \u03c4i = \u03b8L /2\u03c4i for \u03be0 = \u03c4i /wi . Intuitively,\n\nthis maximum is achieved when light roughly sweeps the\nangular width \u03b8L of the beam, in the shortest achievable\nduration for this pulse. This optimum case corresponds\nto a pulse front delay of \u03c4i across the laser beam\ndia\u221a\nmeter\u221awi before focusing, while at focus wf = 2w0 and\n\u03c4f = 2\u03c4i , leading to a reduction of the peak intensity by\na factor of 2 only compared to the case when \u03be = 0. For a\n25 fs laser pulse focused with \u03b8L = 0.35 rad (wi \u2248 f /3),\nvrmax reaches the considerable value of 7 mrad/f s, i.e.\n\u2248 1012 revolutions per second.\nWFR has an immediate and far-reaching interest in\nthe context of attosecond pulse generation. When a usual\nlaser pulse is used to drive HHG in gases or plasmas,\nthe generated train of N attosecond pulses is generally\nproduced within a collimated beam, with a divergence\nsmaller than that of the initial laser beam. In contrast,\nin the presence of WFR, due to the coherence of HHG,\nthese N attosecond pulses are all emitted in slightly different directions, which correspond to the instantaneous\ndirections of propagation of the laser field at the times of\ngeneration.\nThis attosecond lighthouse effect can be exploited\nto produce N angularly well-separated short-wavelength\nbeams, each one containing a single attosecond pulse. To\nachieve such a result, the rotation \u2206\u03b2 = vr \u2206t of the wavefront in the time interval \u2206t between the emissions of\ntwo successive attosecond pulses has to be larger than the\ndivergence \u03b8n of the short-wavelength light beam around\nfrequency n\u03c9L . Since the maximum achievable value of\nvr is vrmax = \u03b8L /2\u03c4i , this is only possible provided the\nfollowing general condition is fulfilled :\n1\n\u03b8n\n\u2264\n\u03b8L\n\u03b1pNc\n\n(5)\n\nwhere Nc \u2265 N is the number of optical cycles in the driving laser pulse, p the number of attosecond pulses generated every laser optical cycle, and \u03b1 = O(1) a prefactor\nwhich depends on the intensity contrast required between\na given attosecond pulse and its first satellites (see Supplementary Information). The key issue to exploit this\neffect is thus to achieve a sufficiently small divergence of\nthe harmonic beam, which critical value increases as the\nduration of the driving laser pulse decreases, according\nto Eq.(5).\nTo validate the basic physics previously described, we\nnow focus on the case of HHG on plasma mirrors in the\nrelativistic interaction regime. As an intense laser field\nreflects on a dense plasma with a sharp surface, it induces an oscillation of the plasma surface, which generates through the Doppler effect high-order harmonics\nin the reflected beam, associated to trains of attosecond\npulses. We first describe this process with the simple Relativistic Oscillating Mirror (ROM) model described in\nref.

The right panels show instantaneous snapshots of the intensity of the attosecond pulses corresponding to harmonic\norders 70 to 80, as a function of transverse and longitudinal spatial coordinates x and z, at a distance from the source larger\nthan the Rayleigh length of the corresponding harmonics. Note that assuming constant laser intensity, the peak spectral signal\ndecreases by a factor N 2 between panels ((b) and (h) (while the total integrated signal increases), due to (1) the dispersion of the\nN attosecond pulses in different directions, and (2) the resulting absence of constructive interferences at harmonic frequencies\nof the laser.\n\n2, for different WFR velocities, from 0 to vrmax . As expected, in the absence of WFR, harmonics of the laser\nfrequency are emitted in a single collimated beam (Fig.\n2(b)), with a divergence weaker than that of the fundamental frequency, and are associated in the time domain\nto a train of 5 attosecond pulses (Fig. 2(c)). As vr increases, this single beam progressively splits into a set of\ndifferent beams (Fig. 2(e,h)). At the optimum rotation\nvelocity, these beams are angularly well-separated (Fig.\n2(h)), each of them carries a continuous electromagnetic\nspectrum, and is associated to a single attosecond pulse\n(Fig. 2(i)).\nTo confirm the predictions of this simple model, we\nhave performed 2D Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations\nof HHG on plasma mirrors, in the ROM regime [12]\n(a0 = 6), including WFR (see the Methods section). The\nresults of such simulations are displayed in Fig. 3(a) and\n(b), with and without WFR. The attosecond lighthouse\neffect is clearly observed (see also movie in Supplementary Information), and the rotation velocity is large enough, and the short-wavelength light beam divergence\n\nsmall enough, to isolate a single attosecond pulse by simply setting a slit in the far field (Fig. 3(b)). This shows\nthat fulfilling Eq.(5) is physically realistic for plasma mirrors.\nSince the attosecond lighthouse effect relies on the universal relationship between the laser phase \u03c6 and the harmonic phases \u03c6n , \u03c6n = n\u03c6, it in principle applies to any\nHHG mechanism. It will however be particularly relevant in the case of plasma mirrors, since its implementation only requires a slight rotation of one of the gratings\nof the compressor, or introducing a prism in the beam\n(see Supplementary Information). This is by no means\ncomparable to the experimental complexity of the gating\ntechniques proposed so far for plasma mirrors [8\u201310].\nCompared to all other gating methods in any generation medium, the attosecond lighthouse effect also provides an ideal optical scheme for attosecond pump-probe\nexperiments, which avoids critical temporal jitter issues\nrelated to the use of multiple laser pulses. Indeed, two or\nmore perfectly synchronized single attosecond pulses can\nbe generated with a single laser pulse, in spatially sepa-\n\n\f4\n\nIntensity (a.u)\n\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\nAttosecond\nLighthouse\n\nFigure 3: Particle-in-Cell simulation of the attosecond\nlighthouse effect. The left panels shows the far-field intensity distribution of the attosecond pulses (harmonic orders\n15 to 30) generated when an intense laser field (a0 = 6,\nwf = 8\u03bbL , \u03c4f = 22 f s, \u03b8L = 56 mrad), with a WFR velocity vr = vrmax = 1.3 mrad/f s, reflects on a plasma mirror\nwhere it induces the ROM effect. These physical parameters\nare experimentally realistic, and the obtained ratio of harmonic and laser divergences consistent with experimental data\n[15]. The right panel shows the angularly-integrated temporal\nintensity profile of this field (red curve), after filtering by the\ndiaphragm displayed in red on the left panel, which selects\n\u2248 60 % of the main pulse energy. The blue curve corresponds\nto the temporal profile obtained from a PIC simulation in the\nsame interaction conditions, but without WFR. Both curves\nhave been normalized by the peak intensity of the train without WFR. Panel (c) shows a schematic layout of an attosecond pump-probe experiment that uses a lighthouse source.\n\nrated beams, by setting adequate spatial masks in the far\nfield (Fig. 3(c)). These multiple pulses can then be manipulated with a few independent optics, and recombined\nwith a variable delay on a target.\nThis effect also has great potential in terms of metrology. First, it provides a direct way to study the properties of all individual attosecond pulses generated along a\nlaser pulse. By measurements on the different beams, the\nspectrum, divergence, relative energy of each of these individual pulses can be determined. This will particularly\nuseful in experiments that exploit HHG as a probe of the\ngenerating medium, since it provides a stroboscope that\nfor instance registers the temporal evolution of molecular\norbitals [16, 17] with attosecond resolution over the whole\nlaser pulse duration , without the need to scan any delay. Second, with WFR, the propagation directions of the\nN attosecond pulses depend on their times of emission,\nand thus provide direct information on the physics of the\ngeneration process. Besides, since these emission times\ndepend linearly on the Carrier-Envelop relative Phase\n\nCEP=\u03c0\nCEP=0\n\n\u221220\n\n0\n\n\u03b8 (mrad)\n\n20\n\nFigure 4: Sensitivity to the Carrier-Envelop relative\nPhase of the driving laser. The curves display the spatial profile of the spectrally-integrated harmonic signal (from\norders 25 to 30) in the far-field, for two values of the drivinglaser pulse CEP differing by \u03c0, obtained from PIC simulations, for the same physical parameters as in Fig. 3.\n\n(CEP) [18] of the driving laser pulse, changes in the CEP\nresult in shifts of the emission angular pattern under the\nbeam spatial envelop, as illustrated in Fig. 4. On the one\nhand, this implies that CEP stabilization is still required\nto achieve shot-to-shot reproducibility of this source. But\non the other hand, when CEP is not stabilized, measuring\nthe harmonic beam angular pattern provides a straightforward means of tracking CEP variations right at focus,\nand of binning any experimental data obtained on different laser shots as a function of its actual value. This\nfor instance opens the way to CEP-resolved experiments\nin the relativistic interaction regime.\nIn conclusion, wavefront rotation constitutes a very powerful tool for attosecond Science, and provides an ideal\nscheme to isolate highly-collimated attosecond pulses in\nthe X-ray range from beams reflected on plasma mirrors\n[19\u201321]. More generally, while spatio-temporal couplings\nof ultrafast laser beams have so far mostly been considered as detrimental, this paper illustrates how shaping\nlight fields in both time and space can provide new degrees of freedom to manipulate matter with intense light,\nleading to new experimental capabilities.\nMethods\nThe oscillating mirror model : The model we use\nis similar to the one developed in ref.[14], adapted to a\n2D case with WFR. The position Z(xf , t) of the mirror surface at the transverse position xf follows an harmonic oscillation at the \u221a\nlaser frequency, with peak velocity vm (xf , t)/c = a/ 1 + a2 , where a(xf , t) is the\nspatio-temporal envelope of the incident laser. This leads\nto Z(xf , t) = (vm /\u03c9L ) cos \u03c6(xf , t), with \u03c6 given by\nEq.(2). The reflected field Er (xf , t) is then proportional\nto \u1ebc(xf , tret )eikL Z(tret ) , where tret (xf ) is the solution of\nZ(xf , tret ) = c(t \u2212 tret ).\n\n\f5\nParticle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations : We use the\nPIC code CALDER in 2D. The plasma has a maximum\ndensity of 100nc , an initial density gradient of \u03bbL /200,\nan initial electronic temperature of 0.1 keV , and ions are\nmobile. The incidence angle is 45 \u030a, and the laser field is\np-polarized. This field is injected in the simulation box\nthrough boundary conditions, in the form of Eq. (2). The\nsize of the simulation box is 40\u03bbL \u00d7 75\u03bbL , with a mesh\nsize of 2.9 \u00d7 10\u22123 \u03bbL , the time step is 2 \u00d7 10\u22123 TL , and\nwe use 20 particles/cell. A typical calculation requires 48\nhours on 512 CPUs.\nPropagation of the reflected field : Once the reflected field Er (xf , z = 0, t) right after the target is obtained (either from the model or from PIC simulations),\nwe calculate its propagation in vacuum using plane\nwaves decomposition (i.e. by applying the phase term\nexp(icky2 z/2\u03c9) to the 2D Fourier-Transforms \u00ca(ky , \u03c9)\nof Fig. 2(b-e-h), and then calculating the 2D inverse\nFourier-transform), in order to determine its structure\nEr (x, z, t) at arbitrary distance z from the target.\n\n[1] S.

For given laser parameters, the maximum possible value of \u2206\u03b2 is determined by the maximum value\nvrmax = \u03b8L /2\u03c4i of vr , and is given by \u2206\u03b2 max = \u03b8L /2pNc,\nwhere Nc is the number of optical cycle in the laser pulse\nbefore focusing.

We used Mathematica to invert it and determine the\nvalue of \u03b8L /\u03b8n required to reach given values of \u03b3 and f .\nThe result of this calculation is plotted in Fig. S -8(a),\nfor a pulse with Nc = 9 optical periods and for p = 1\n(corresponding to HHG on plasma mirrors).\n\n\u03b3 =\n\n13 11 9,4\n\n20\n10\n\nZ\n\n3\n25\n\nFactor \u03b1\n\n% retained energy f\n\nLet's note E1 the energy of the main attosecond pulse\nafter the slit (yellow area in Fig. S -7), and E2 the energy\nof one of the satellites (blue or orange shaded area in\nFig. S -7(a), assumed to be identical). We assume that\nall attosecond pulses are Gaussian, with the same total\nenergies ET and full width at 1/e, \u03b8n . The main attosecond beam is supposed to be centered on \u03b8 = 0, so that\nits satellites are then centered at \u00b1\u2206\u03b2 max .\n\n2\n\u03c7(z) = \u221a\n\u03c0\n\n2\n/\u03b8n\n\nd\u03b8\n\n2\n2\ne\u22124\u03b8 /\u03b8n d\u03b8\n\n(23)\n\nThe numbers displayed on this graph for \u03b8L /\u03b8n can\nbe interpreted in a different way. Indeed, physically, the\nsmallest divergence that can be achieved for a given harmonic order is \u03b8n = \u03b8L /n, when the harmonic source\nhas a size matching the laser spot size and a flat spatial\nphase. Therefore, the displayed numbers can alternatively be interpreted as the minimum possible harmonic\norder, beyond which given values of f and \u03b3 can be obtained by the attosecond lighthouse effect.\nFinally, we relate this result to the \u03b1 parameter that\nappears in Eq.(5) of the Letter. The value of \u03b1, required\nto reach given values of f and \u03b3, can be deduced from a\ngraph such as the one in Fig. S-8(a), through the equation\n\u03b1 = \u03b8L /\u03b8n pNc . The curve in Fig. S - 8(b) thus shows the\nevolution of \u03b1, for a retained energy fraction f = 60 %,\nas a function of the required contrast \u03b3.\n\n\f"}
