Introduction\nAs seen in many examples over the years, there is an intriguing interplay between the\ngeometry of string theory compactifications (in the presence of branes, or near singularities) and the dynamics of supersymmetric quantum field theories in various dimensions.\nThe geometry of Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds and their moduli spaces can determine the nonperturbative vacuum manifold and the spectrum of BPS particles of a field theory. Extremal\ntransitions in the geometry can map to transitions between different branches of low-energy\nsupersymmetric gauge theories. Examples with 8 supercharges include transition between\nHiggs and Coulomb branches of abelian [1,2,3] and non-abelian [4,5,6] four-dimensional\nN = 2 gauge theories, three-dimensional N = 4 theories [7] and five-dimensional N = 1\ntheories [8,9,11]. For theories with four supercharges, i.e., N = 1 in four or N = 2 in\nthree dimensions, an essential new ingredient is needed to match between deformations of\na Calabi\u2013Yau geometry and field theory dynamics: a choice of background fluxes or background branes in needed on top of the geometry, which induces an N = 1 superpotential\nin the field theory. An example is the fluxed conifold transition in a Calabi\u2013Yau threefold,\nleading to confining glueball superpotentials in the associated non-abelian gauge theories\n[12,13].\nIn this paper, we study extremal transitions in M- and F-theory compactifications\non Calabi\u2013Yau fourfolds, whose low energy theories are described by a certain class of\nsupersymmetric theories with four supercharges. The three-dimensional N = 2 theories\nhave again Coulomb and Higgs branches meeting at singular points of the moduli space, as\ndiscussed e.g. in ref. [14]. This turns out to have a nice parallel description in the fourfold\ngeometry, where a set of four-cycles shrinks and another set of four-cycles grows, e.g.:\nflop transition: S1\u266f \u2192 S2\u266f\n\n\u2243\n\nCoulomb1 \u2192 Coulomb2\n\nconifold transition: S \u266f \u2192 S \u266d\n\n\u2243\n\nCoulomb \u2192 Higgs\n\n(1.1)\n\nHere S \u266f denotes an algebraic four-cycle, whereas S \u266d has a generically non-zero volume with\nrespect to the holomorphic (4, 0)-form \u03a9. The spectrum of additional light BPS particles\nnear the transition locus arises on the S \u266f side from M2 branes wrapping small 2-cycles\nin the local geometry. It can eventually be computed in the topologically twisted theory\nassociated with M-theory compactification on the local geometry by counting the number\nof holomorphic sections of certain line bundles, similarly as in ref. [4].\n2\n\n\fAs mentioned above, a key element for four supercharges is the dependence of the\nspectrum and the superpotential obstruction on background flux. In an M-theory compactification on the fourfold one has to specify on top of the fourfold geometry X the\nbackground four-form flux G, which induces the geometric GVW superpotential [15]. Interestingly enough, a quantization condition for G enforces a non-zero flux on a four-cycle\nS \u2208 H4 (X, Z) \u2013 and a non-zero superpotential \u2013 if the second Chern class c2 (X) evaluated\non a S is not even [16]. The local aspects of this quantization condition have not been\nstudied systematically so far. We identify a set of canonical, minimal flux quanta which\nsolve the quantization condition for a given four-cycle geometry.\nAs a consequence of the flux superpotential one expects that topology changing transitions between Calabi\u2013Yau fourfolds will generally be obstructed, except when a judicious\nchoice of flux quanta has been made that solves the quantization condition. If a four-cycle\nS with minimal flux is affected by a transition with a 3d field theory interpretation, these\nflux quanta should correspond to choices in the field theory and the superpotential obstruction should be matched by the 3d spectrum and vacuum structure. Both expectations turn\nout to be true via a beautiful correspondence between sections of certain line bundles in\nthe geometry and meson operators in the field theory.\nIf X is elliptically fibered and a four-dimensional F-theory limit exists, the G-flux\nis replaced by, amongst others, gauge flux on 7-branes wrapping algebraic four-cycles D\nin X. In this case one can resort to the detailed results on the field theory spectra and\npotentials obtained from a local computation in refs. [17,18,19]. As expected, after a circle\ncompactification these results match with those obtained from M2 branes in M-theory as\ndiscussed in this note. The perhaps new point on F-theory obtained here from the Mtheory analysis are local solutions to the flux quantization condition and the interplay of\nspectra, flux quanta and superpotential obstructions near the transition point. These are\nneeded to determine the dynamics on Higgs-branches and recombination of 7-branes in a\nlocal model. Our solutions have a number of parallels to some recent discussions in the\nliterature of flux quanta in F-theory [20,21,22].\nThe low-energy gauge theory gauge fields that we consider all arise from the eleven\ndimensional M-theory 3-form C field on two-cycles, with electrically charged matter from\nM2 branes wrapped on two-cycles. Many early works have already explored aspects of\nconnecting M-theory on fourfolds with three-dimensional N = 2 gauge theory dynamics\nwith M-theory on fourfolds. To cite one example, ref. [23] explored connecting the threedimensional N = 2 gauge theory non-perturbative results, including instanton-generated\n3\n\n\fsuperpotentials [24] and the higher Nf SQED and SQCD results of [14], with M-theory\nrealizations from euclidean M5 branes wrapping six-cycles. Other early works explored aspects of the connection between M-theory background G-flux (which spontaneously breaks\nparity) and three-dimensional Chern-Simons terms, as well as type II or M-theory realizations of 3d mirror symmetry [25], and gauge theory moduli space or phase transitions via\ngeometric transitions, see, e.g., refs. [15,26,27].\nIn this paper we mostly focus on singularities which, when approached through the\nmoduli space of K\u00e4hler structures, arise in codimension one. The light M2-brane states\narise from two-cycles in one homology class and their charge singles out a U (1) gauge\ngroup. To decouple the dynamics of these degrees of freedom we work in the limit in which\nall other cycles are large, including the curve C to which S \u266f shrinks at the transition.\nMuch of the literature on string or M-theory realizations of three-dimensional gauge\ntheories uses spacetime filling D2 or M2 branes at special points in the geometry. That is\nnot our focus here. Including M spacetime filling M2 branes introduces additional fields\nand dynamics in the low-energy three dimensional quantum field theory. In particular,\nthere are moduli fields for varying the points where the M2 branes are located in the\nfourfold. We here focus on small M and, when M is non-zero, on the regions of the moduli\nspace where the M2 branes are not near the fourfold singularity, and hence they do not\nparticipate in or affect the conifold transitions. In terms of the three dimensional field\ntheory, the degrees of freedom coming from the M2 branes are, in this region of moduli\nspace, decoupled from those that we study, associated with the geometric singularity.\nInteresting new degrees of freedom will become light when the M2 branes are near the\nsingularity, and can potentially participate in the conifold transitions; we will not discuss\nthat here in detail, leaving it for future work. We will also not discuss here the interesting\nlarge M limit, where the backreaction of the M2 branes on the geometry leads to M-theory\non AdS4 \u00d7 H7 . We will see here that, even without including M2 branes in the conifold\ntransition dynamics, there is already a lot of rich structure.\nThe organization of this paper is as follows: In Section 2 we set the stage for the subsequent analysis and collect various aspects of G-flux of M-theory on Calabi\u2013Yau fourfold\ngeometries. In Section 3 we set up local Calabi\u2013Yau fourfold geometries so as to model\nthe extremal fourfold transitions of interest. We analyze consistency conditions for Gfluxes imposed by the quantization and tadpole cancellation conditions. We examine the\nstructure and the flat directions of the flux-induced potentials. In Section 4 we embed the\n4\n\n\flocal fourfold geometries into global Calabi\u2013Yau fourfolds, for which we again examine the\nbehavior of (consistently quantized) G-fluxes together with their flux-induced scalar potentials, as we go through extremal M-theory transitions. We discuss our findings both for\ngeneric Calabi\u2013Yau fourfolds with a genus g curve of conifold singularities and for explicit\nCalabi\u2013Yau fourfold examples. In particular we find particular flux configurations with\nflat directions through the extremal transition. Finally, we comment on the relationship of\nour M-theory configurations to similar F-theory compactifications. In Section 5 we discuss\nthe associated three-dimensional low energy theory, which reproduces the M-theory phase\nstructure obtained by geometric means in the previous sections.\n\n2. Preliminaries: M-theory on Calabi\u2013Yau fourfolds\n\nIn a compactification of M-theory on a Calabi\u2013Yau fourfold X to three dimensions,\none has to specify the background flux for the four-form G. We first collect a few basic facts\non G and the superpotential induced by it.

Minimization with respect to the complex\n\nstructure deformations and K\u00e4hler deformations requires G to be of Hodge type (2,2) and\nprimitive, i.e., J \u2227 G = 0, which in turn implies that G is self-dual, \u2217G = G [15].\n\nThe superpotential W (\u03a9) vanishes if G is dual to an algebraic cycle and the twisted\nf (J) vanishes if G is Poinar\u00e9 dual to a special Lagrangian cycle. There is\nsuperpotential W\n\na decomposition of H4 (X, Z) into 'vertical' and 'horizontal' sublattices with the property\nf (J) always vanishes\nthat W (\u03a9) always vanishes if G is in the vertical sublattice and W\nif G is in the horizontal sublattice. (See Appendix A for a thorough discussion of these\nsublattices.) It is therefore tempting to decompose G into these pieces\nGV\nGH\nG\n=\n+\n,\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n\n(2.4)\n\nand treat the pieces separately. Unfortunately, this decomposition does not work within the\nlattice H 4 (X, Z) \u2013 rational coefficients must be introduced (except perhaps in exceptional\ncases).3 The generic solution to the quantization condition (2.2) will therefore arise from\na mixed G flux, where the decomposition (2.4) of GZ is not defined over the integers.\nAs will be studied in some detail below, G fluxes of mixed type also give a new\nimportant class of supersymmetric vacua. The standard solution to (2.1) is to shift G by\n2\n\nAs we will review and discuss in Section 5, W (\u03a9) is a true superpotential, for Higgs branch\n\nfields in \u03a9, whereas f\nW (J ) is not a superpotential but rather gives Chern-Simons terms and masses\n\nfor Coulomb branch moduli in J . Given the different nature of W (\u03a9) and W (J ), adding then\ntogether in W is perhaps curious; W, though, can contribute to the central charge of 1/4-BPS\nobjects. Moreover, as in [15], it is tempting to introduce an additional massive field, \u03a6, with\nW(\u03a9, J, \u03a6) having various h\u03a6i minima that give W(\u03a9, J ) for the various allowed G fluxes.\n3\n\nIt has been suggested in ref. [30] that any missing cycle classes might be provided by Cayley\n\nsubmanifolds calibrated by the form \u03a90 + 21 J 2 (see (2.3)), where \u03a90 a fixed representative for the\nclass of \u03a9. Note that if calibrated cycles do not provide a basis for H4 (X, Q), the superpotential (2.3) is only valid on the sublocus of deformation space, where G is dual to a sum of calibrated\ncycles with rational coefficients, including the special case of a split flux G = GV + GH .\n\n6\n\n\fa class \u03c9 dual to an algebraic cycle, with \u03c9 \u2212 c2 (X)/2 \u2208 H 4 (X, Z). This flux of a split\nf (J) for the K\u00e4hler moduli and the condition\ntype generates a twisted superpotential W\nf (J) = 0 = dW\nf (J) would exclude supersymmetric vacua for h1,1 (X) = 1 and greatly\nW\nreduce the number of vacua in general. On the other hand, a mixed flux allows to cancel\n\nthe c2 (X)/2 anomaly locally on each cycle in H4 (X, Z), as required, while at the same time\n\nthe twisted superpotential can be identically zero and there is no restriction on the K\u00e4hler\nmoduli at all.\nIn the following we will study topology changing transitions between two Calabi\u2013Yau\nfourfolds X \u266f and X \u266d , where a number of algebraic four-cycles Si\u266f shrink on the X \u266f side,\nand a number of new, generically non-algebraic cycles Sk\u266d appear on the X \u266d side.4 As\nindicated in Appendix A, all of the Hodge numbers of X \u266f and X \u266d are determined by three\nspecific ones (which also determine the Euler characteristic \u03c7, the signature \u03c3, and the\ndecomposition of h2,2 into self-dual and anti-self-dual parts). The changes are:\n\u03b4\u03c7\n\u03b4\u03c3\n=\n= \u03b4h1,1 \u2212\u03b4h1,2 +\u03b4h1,3 ,\n6\n2\n\n1,1\n\u03b4h2,2\n,\n\u2212 = \u03b4h\n\n1,1\n\u03b4h2,2\n\u22122\u03b4h1,2 +4\u03b4h1,3 . (2.5)\n+ = 3\u03b4h\n\nIf \u03b4\u03c7 is not a multiple of 24, integrality of the M2 brane charges M (X \u266d ) and M (X \u266f )\nrequires a jump of flux quanta during the transition. (In fact, if we keep locations of the\nspace-filling M2-branes far away from the transition, any change in \u03c7 will require a jump\nof flux quanta.) A priori it is not obvious whether this prohibits the transition or whether\nthere is a physical effect that causes this jump. As argued below, transitions are possible\nif there are appropriate new massless states at the transition point that induce a jump of\nflux by a one-loop effect.\nSince the quantization condition (2.2) implies a local constraint on each four-cycle, the\nnon-zero jump of flux must appear on four-cycles that take part in the transition. A simple\nintersection argument shows that if T \u266f is any four-cycle which transversally intersects a\nvanishing four-cycle S \u266f , the value of c2 jumps as\nZ\nZ\nZ\n(T \u266f .S \u266f )\n\u266d\n\u266f\nc2 (X ) + \u03b4c2 ,\n\u03b4c2 = \u266f \u266f\nc2 (X ) =\nc2 (X \u266f ) .\n(S .S ) S \u266f\nT\u266d\nT\u266f\n\n(2.6)\n\nHere T \u266d is a cycle which replaces the T \u266f after the local surgery that describes transition\nfrom X \u266f to X \u266d ; detailed examples in local and global geometries will be considered in\nSections 3 and 4.4. If \u03b4c2 is odd, quantization will require a non-zero flux on either T \u266f or\non T \u266d .\n4\n\nVarious aspects of transitions of this type have been previously studied in refs. [28,31,21,22].\n\n7\n\n\f3. Conifold transitions in local Calabi\u2013Yau fourfolds\nAfter these preliminaries, we turn to a detailed study of the local model for the\ngeneric transition, which describes a higher-dimensional analogue of the familiar extremal\ntransitions at isolated conifold points in Calabi\u2013Yau threefolds [1,2]. The double point of\na threefold is given by the equation\nx1 x2 \u2212 x3 x4 = 0 ,\n\n(3.1)\n\nin terms of the complex coordinates xl of C4 . The fourfold analog of a conifold point\narises from fibering this conifold singularity over a genus g curve C. To accomplish that,\nthe coordinates xl are taken to be sections of line bundles Ll over the curve C, and the\ne sing is given by the hypersurface (3.1) in the fivesingular local Calabi\u2013Yau fourfold X\n\ndimensional complex variety L1 \u2295 L2 \u2295 L3 \u2295 L4 \u2192 C.

In addition, the transitions may be obstructed\ndynamically by the flux induced scalar potential for the deformations. Naturally, these\nobstructions cannot solely be phrased in terms of topological data, but depend on the\nactual values of the deformation 'moduli'. In the next section we therefore examine the\nflux-induced scalar potentials and exemplify their role in the context of these geometric\nphase transitions.\n3.5.

As explained and spelled out in ref. [37], in order to get a handle on the C-field in\nthe presence of non-trivial background fluxes, we consider the pair (C, G) as an element of\n\nCheeger-Simons cohomology [38,39]\n\u0013\n\u0012\nG\n\u2208 C 4 (X, Z) \u00d7 C 3 (X, R) \u00d7 \u03a94 (X) ,\ngZ , C,\n2\u03c0\n\n(3.46)\n\nThis triple consists of a closed integral four-cocycle gZ , a real three cochain C and a closed\nfour-form\n\nG\n2\u03c0\n\nsuch that\ndgZ = 0 ,\n\ndG = 0 ,\n\nG\n\u2212 gZ = dC ,\n2\u03c0\n\n(3.47)\n\nmodulo\n(gZ , C) \u223c (gZ + d\u039b, C \u2212 \u039b \u2212 d\u03c1) ,\n\n(3.48)\n\nwith (\u039b, \u03c1) \u2208 C 3 (X, Z) \u00d7 C 2 (X, R).15\nIn this triple the integral cocycle gZ contains the topological information of the background flux, while the four-form G is a solution to the M-theory equations of motion, which\nto leading order is a harmonic four-form. Finally, the real three-cocycle C, which corresponds to the expectation value of three-form M-theory gauge field, captures the deviation\nof the dynamical flux G from the rigid topological integral cocycle flux gZ .\n15\n\nThis description has to be appropriately adjusted for four-form background fluxes with shifted\n\nquantization conditions according to eq.

The non-zero flux po-\n\ntential describes a N = 1 superpotential which drives the theory to loci in the deformation\nspace with extra massless dyon states, which condense in the N = 1 vacuum [41]. The\nspectrum of massless states corresponds to a particular factorization of the Seiberg-Witten\ncurve in the parent N = 2 theory, which supports these states on vanishing cycles. The\nbeautiful interplay between the factorization of the defining equations of the effectively\none-dimensional geometry, a complex curve, and the minimization of the quantum superpotential computed by periods integrals is provided by the Abel-Jacobi theorem, which\nlinks the zeros of a linear combination of periods to the existence of a certain meromorphic\nfunction in the factorized geometry [40].\nIn the following we find a similar structure for the present minimization problem by\nreducing the superpotential for the complex structure moduli to Abel-Jacobi integrals on\n23\n\n\fthe curve C.16 The Abel-Jacobi theorem then relates the minima of the superpotential to\nthe existence of line bundles with global holomorphic sections, with the latter associated to\nthe massless 3d states that are the building blocks of the meson operators.

Since the deformations \u01eb exhibit these 2k\nspaces Def(X\nC\n1/2\n\ndouble points, there are 2k vanishing B-cycles in the deformed geometry and the fourfold\nf\u266d remains singular at the fibers over these Weierstrass points.

The above arguments based on the superpotential are however not restricted to the hyperelliptic case (and not even to spin structures,\nas they apply to more general line bundles, i.e., tensor products with the flat bundle L0 ).\nIt would be interesting to study the classification of spin structures on non-hyperelliptic\ncurves from this perspective.\nIn this context note that the Z2 symmetry, which asserts the cancellation of the two\ncontributions to W+ in the configuration a), arises here from the hyperelliptic involution,\nbut can be interpreted more generally as a Z2 symmetry acting on the SU (2g \u2212 2) lattice\n(3.30), which asserts the coincidence of the volumes of two subgroups of four-cycles (roots)\nwith identical intersections. A natural ansatz for a systematic construction of critical\nsubsets is therefore to classify and study those loci in the deformation space of SU (2g \u2212 2),\nwhich are invariant under discrete symmetries acting on the group lattice.\nGenus 6 curves with a maximal spin structure\nf\u266d built upon a genus 6 curve that\nf\u266f and X\nWe now discuss the dynamics of the phases X\n\narises as the zero locus of a (generic) homogeneous degree five polynomial p5 in P2\nC = {p5 (x1 , x2 , x3 ) \u2261 0} \u2282 P2 ,\n\n(3.87)\n\nwith homogeneous coordinates x1 to x3 .\nIn order to have dynamical transitions we focus on a scenario with vanishing flux\nf\u266f .

A\n\u0003\n\u0002\nglobal sections, which\nspin structure of a genus g curve is called maximal, if it has g+1\n2\nis the maximal number of sections for a spin structure of a curve [43]. However, a spin\nstructure can only be maximal if the curve C is either hyperelliptic or it is of genus four\nor genus six [46,45]. The curve (3.87) is not hyperelliptic, and therefore we encounter here\nan example of a maximal spin structure for the exceptional case g = 6. In the subsequent\nexamples, we come back to maximal spin structures of hyperelliptic curves.\nf\u266d\nVanishing G-flux on the local fourfold X\n\nIn our first scenario, we take a generic genus g curve C (g > 1) with the background fluxes\nG\u266f\n1\n= \u00b1 [S \u266f ] ,\n2\u03c0\n2\n\nG\u266d\n= 0,\n2\u03c0\n\n(3.89)\n\nin the resolved and in the deformed phase, respectively.

Conifold transition in global Calabi\u2013Yau fourfolds\nIn this section we study the embedding of the local transitions into global fourfolds.\nThe globalization of the locally consistent fluxes identified above leads us to consider fluxes\nsupported on integral homology cycles of a mixed type which give a new class of solutions\nto the local anomaly conditions. We study the flat directions of the superpotential for these\nsolutions and show that these are often the only solutions which give rise to supersymmetric\nvacua and dynamically realized phase transitions.\nAt the critical points the local condition captured by the Abel-Jacobi theorem translates to the appearance of new algebraic four-cycle classes at special complex structure\n36\n\n\fwhere the polynomial of the global hypersurface allows for reducible algebraic cycles. Reducible algebraic four-cycles supporting G-flux have been already studied in the context of\nF-theory and elliptic fibrations in ref. [21].21 The correspondence between reducible algebraic cycles in Calabi\u2013Yau threefolds and its dual fourfolds and the critical points of N = 1\nsuperpotentials via an Abel-Jacobi argument is also prominent in the works [50,51,48,52]\non N = 1 mirror symmetry.\nTo avoid being too technical from the beginning, we first consider the sextic fourfold\nas a simple example, as it illustrates already some of the distinct features of the new class\nof mixed fluxes emerging from the local discussion.\n4.1. A simple example: Extremal transition for the sextic\nBefore we delve into the general discussion of extremal M-theory transitions in Calabi\u2013\nYau fourfolds, we first present an instructive example. Let us consider the sextic hypersurface Calabi\u2013Yau fourfold X \u266d \u2261 P5 [6] in the projective space P5 , given in terms of a general\nhomogeneous polynomial of degree six in the projective coordinates x1 , . . . , x6 of P5 . The\nfourfold X \u266d has Hodge numbers and Euler characteristic\n= 1,\nh1,1\nX\u266d\n\n= 0\nh2,1\nX\u266d\n\n= 1 752 ,\nh2,2\nX\u266d\n\n= 426 ,\nh3,1\nX\u266d\n\n\u03c7(X \u266d ) = 2 610 .\n\n(4.1)\n\nAs the defining sextic polynomial degenerates to x5 g(x) + x6 h(x) with two degree-five\npolynomials g(x) and h(x), it develops along the codimension two locus x5 = x6 = g(x) =\nh(x) = 0 a genus 76 curve C of conifold singularities. A small resolution of this singular\ncurve yields the Calabi\u2013Yau fourfold X \u266f with Hodge numbers and Euler characteristic22\nh1,1\n= 2,\nX\u266f\n\nh2,1\n= 0,\nX\u266f\n\nh3,1\n= 350 ,\nX\u266f\n\nh2,2\n= 1 452 ,\nX\u266f\n\n\u03c7(X \u266f ) = 2 160 .\n\n(4.2)\n\nWe observe that the Euler characteristic changes by \u03b4\u03c7 = \u03c7(X \u266d ) \u2212 \u03c7(X \u266f ) = 450 =\n6 \u2212 6 g(C), in agreement with the change in Euler characteristics deduced from eqs. (3.6)\n21\n\nA dual spectral cover description for G-fluxes supported on algebraic four-cycles has been\n\ngiven in refs. [47,48,19,49].\n22\n\nWe obtain the small resolution as follows (c.f., [53,2]). The curve C lies within P3 defined\n\nby x5 = x6 = 0. We blow up P3 within P5 , which may be realized in P5 \u00d7 P1 as the locus\ns1 x5 \u2212 s2 x6 = 0 with the projective coordinates s1 , s2 of P1 . The resolved Calabi\u2013Yau fourfold\nX \u266f is the locus 0 = s1 x5 \u2212 s2 x6 = s1 g(x) + s2 h(x) within P5 \u00d7 P1 . Alternatively, we will give a\n(related) toric hypersurface realization of X \u266f in Section 4.4.\n\n37\n\n\fand (3.16) in the context of the local extremal transitions. Furthermore, the Hodge numbers change as anticipated in eq. (2.5), which we will show in general in Section 4.2 and\nSection 4.3 for such extremal transitions.\nTo describe dynamical phase transition between X \u266d and X \u266f , let us now turn to the\nbackground fluxes. Firstly, we observe that the Euler characteristic \u03c7(X \u266f ) is divisible by 24\nand the second Chern class c2 (X \u266f ) is even in H 4 (X \u266f , Z). As consequence, the Calabi\u2013Yau\nfourfold X \u266f together with MX \u266f =\n\n2 160\n24\n\n= 90 space-time filling M2 branes fulfills both the\n\ntadpole constraint (2.2) and the quantization condition (2.2) in the absence of background\nfluxes G\u266f = 0. Thus, such a scenario represents a consistent M-theory background. Due\nto the absence of background fluxes, there are no potentials (2.3) and we arrive at a\nsupersymmetric M-theory vacuum on X \u266f with\nMX \u266f = 90 ,\n\nG\u266f = 0 .\n\n(4.3)\n\nFrom a local perspective in the vicinity of the curve C \u2013 that is to say from the vantage\nf\u266f of a resolved genus 76 curve C as discussed in Section 3\npoint of the local fourfold X\n\n\u2013 the vacuum (4.3) describes a local configuration with vanishing torsion class k \u266f = 0.\nFurthermore, due to the absence of homologically non-trivial three-cycles, i.e, h2,1\n= 0,\nX\u266f\n\nthe phase factors \u03bdn\u266f are set to zero due to the embedding into the global geometry X \u266f .\nLet us now examine dynamical phase transitions into the fourfold X \u266d . The Euler\ncharacteristic of \u03c7(X \u266d ) is not divisible by 24 and the second Chern class c2 (X \u266d ) = 15H 2\nis odd, where the class H is induced from the hyperplane class of the ambient P5 .23 Thus,\nconsistency of M-theory on the fourfold X \u266d requires a half-integrally quantized background\nflux G\u266d such that the quantization condition (2.1) is met. Then the tadpole condition (2.2)\ncan be fulfilled with an integral number of space-time filling M2 branes MX \u266d .\nFor a dynamical phase transition into X \u266d , the required background flux G\u266d must\nbe supersymmetric for an unobstructed deformation into X \u266d . In the discussed global\nsetting these deformations are parametrized by homogeneous polynomials of degree six\n\u01eb(x) according to\nx5 g(x) + x6 h(x) = \u01eb(x) .\n23\n\nSince\n\nR\n\nX\u266d\n\n(4.4)\n\nH 2 \u2227 H 2 = 6, the four form class H 2 is not divisible by two in H 4 (X \u266d , Z). Hence,\n\nc2 (X \u266d ) is not divisible by two.\n\n38\n\n\fThe deformation \u01eb(x) restricts on the genus g curve C to a section of the canonical bundle\nf\u266d . The analysis of the superpotential\nK , as discussed in the context of the local fourfold X\nC\n\nin the local geometry of Section 3.6 told us that \u2013 for vanishing phase factors \u03bdn\u266f and for\nvanishing torsion classes k \u266f = k \u266d = 0 \u2013 the section of the canonical bundle \u01eb must factor\n1/2\n\ninto sections of an appropriate spin structure KC\n\nas \u01eb = \u01eb+ \u01eb\u2212 .24\n\nWhen the local geometry is embedded into a global fourfold X \u266d , the two local algebraic\ncycles defined by x5 = x6 = \u01ebi (x) = 0 must extend to globally defined algebraic cycles.\nThe easiest way to achieve this is to assume that the factorization condition globalizes, i.e.,\nthe sextic deformation \u01eb(x) in eq. (4.4) has to factor into two homogeneous polynomials\nof degree three, which is a constraint on the complex structure of X \u266d . The new aspect\nin the global geometry is that for this complex structure there is a new integral algebraic\nfour-cycle class. Indeed if we set x5 = x6 = 0 in eq. (4.4), then \u2013 contrary to the generic\nsextic fourfold X \u266d near the transition \u2013 we get a reducible algebraic four-cycle with two\ncomponents T\u00b1\u266d : x5 = x6 = \u01eb\u00b1 (x) = 0. By construction the integral four-form classes\n[T\u00b1\u266d ] add up to the square of the hyperplane class, namely H 2 = [T+\u266d ] + [T\u2212\u266d ].\nA global version of the local result (3.77) obtained for k \u266f = 0 in Sect. 3.6 is the flux\n\u0011\n1\u0010 \u266d\nG\u266d\n[T+ ] \u2212 [T\u2212\u266d ] .\n=\n2\u03c0\n2\n\n(4.5)\n\nAs expected from the local analysis, this satisfies the quantization condition (2.1):\n\u0011 15\nG\u266d\nc2 (X \u266d )\n1\u0010 \u266d\n[T+ ] \u2212 [T\u2212\u266d ] \u2212 H 2 = \u22127[T+\u266d ] \u2212 8[T\u2212\u266d ] .\n\u2212\n=\n2\u03c0\n2\n2\n2\n\n(4.6)\n\nFurthermore, with the help of the intersection numbers T+\u266d .T+\u266d = T\u2212\u266d .T\u2212\u266d = 39 and\nT\u2212\u266d .T+\u266d = \u221236 of the four-cycles T\u00b1\u266d ,25 we determine for the flux (4.6) a tadpole-free Mtheory configuration with space-time filling M2 branes that is unchanged from (4.3)\nMX \u266d =\n\n1\n2 610\n\u2212\n(2 * 39 + 2 * 36) = 90 .\n24\n2*4\n\n(4.7)\n\nNote that the classes [T\u00b1\u266d ] continue to exist, and provide a solution to the local anomaly\ncancellation on each integral four-cycle, for any complex structure away from the factorization locus. For generic complex structure the representatives for [T\u00b1\u266d ] are neither algebraic\n24\n\nExcept for the critical configurations related to An singularities.\n\n25\n\nWe calculate the Euler number of the normal bundle N T\u00b1\u266d , which determines the self-\n\nintersections of T\u00b1\u266d to be 39. Then we infer T\u2212\u266d .T+\u266d = \u221236 from 6 =\n\n39\n\nR\n\nX\u266d\n\nH 2 \u2227 H 2 = (T+\u266d + T\u2212\u266d )2 .\n\n\fnor special Lagrangian and the flux (4.5) is of a mixed type. For the special complex\nstructure the lattice vectors in H 4 (X, Z) associated with the classes [T+\u266d ] and [T\u2212\u266d ] become\northogonal to the class represented by \u03a9 (see also the discussion in App. A.)\nThe flux discussed above gives rise to an unobstructed phase transition between X \u266d\nand X \u266f . As for the K\u00e4hler moduli, the mixed G-flux G\u266d in eq. (4.5) is primitive because\nf is zero. This feature\nof J \u2227 G\u266d \u223c (T+\u266d + T\u2212\u266d )(T+\u266d \u2212 T\u2212\u266d ) = 0. The twisted superpotential W\n\nof the new mixed solution to the anomaly constraint should be compared to the other\nobvious solution of the split type:\n\n\u0011\nG\u266dsplit\n1 2\n1\u0010 \u266d\n\u266d\n[T+ ] + [T\u2212 ] .\n= H =\n2\u03c0\n2\n2\n\n(4.8)\n\nIn distinction to the flux (4.5), this choice of flux generates a twisted superpotential for\nthe K\u00e4hler modulus of the sextic. Note that the two configurations (4.5) and (4.8) are\nconnected by a five-brane domain wall wrapped on T\u2212 .\nOn the other hand, the mixed G-flux generates the superpotential W for the complex\nstructure deformations studied in Section 3.6. As argued there, the critical points of\nthis superpotential are precisely the complex structures for which \u01eb factorizes as \u01eb(x) =\n\u01eb+ (x)\u01eb\u2212 (x). These deformations will keep both cycles T\u00b1\u266d as cycles of type (2, 2), as\nexpected from the results of [29,15]. Hence, moving along factorized deformation directions,\nwe find a dynamically unobstructed phase transition from X \u266f into the deformed phase X \u266d .\nMore precisely, the 150 zeros of \u01eb(x) on the genus 76 curve C split into the g \u2212 1 = 75\nzeros pl \u2208 Z\u00b1 of \u01eb\u00b1 (x), defining the four-cycles Tl\u266d that appear with positive/negative\ncoefficients in (3.77). In the global embedding these two sets of four-cycles in the local\ngeometry add up to the four-cycle classes T\u00b1\u266d in X \u266d . Thus the analyzed phase transition\nrepresents a global embedding of the local transition discussed in eq. (3.43).\nExtremal transitions for other torsion classes correspond to other classes of factorizations of \u01eb(x) and these again give rise to (different) new algebraic four-cycle classes in\nthe global fourfold X \u266d for special complex structures. For the sextic, a globally consistent factorization requires \u01eb\u00b1 to be of degree 3, 2, 1, corresponding to the torsion classes\nk \u266f = 0, 25, 50 and a net number of M2 branes 90, 92, 98, respectively. Note that the flux\ncontribution to the M2 brane charge on X \u266f has the wrong sign for k \u266f > 0 (see (2.2)) and\nindicates an obstruction towards the transition to X \u266f . These obstructed cases are similar\nto the transitions in elliptic fourfolds considered in [21], where the flux contribution on the\nresolved phase appears to have always the wrong sign.\n40\n\n\fAs a concrete example consider the factorization of \u01eb(x) = \u01eb5 (x)\u01eb1 (x) into a degree\nfive and a degree one polynomial. In this case the G-flux becomes\n\u0011\nG\u266d\n1\u0010 \u266d\n\u266d\n[T5 ] \u2212 [T1 ] ,\n=\n2\u03c0\n2\n\n(4.9)\n\nin terms of the corresponding algebraic cycles with H 2 = [T5\u266d ]+[T1\u266d ]. By similar arguments,\nthis flux is again consistent with the quantization constraint (2.1) and yields M \u266d = 98 due\nto the tadpole condition (2.2) (because T5\u266d .T5\u266d = 25, T1\u266d .T1\u266d = 21 and T5\u266d .T1\u266d = \u221220).\nFrom the 125 and 25 zeros of \u01eb5 (x) and \u01eb1 (x), respectively, we obtain 125 non-vanishing\nflux-quanta b\u266dl of charge one, which yield the torsion class k \u266d = 50 according to eq. (3.36).\nR\nHowever, the flux G\u266d is not primitive anymore, because the intersection X \u266d G\u266d \u2227 H 2 = 2\n\ngives rise to a twisted superpotential\n\nf\u266d = 1\nW\n2\n\nZ\n\nX\u266d\n\nG\u266d\n2\n\u2227 J \u2227 J = JH\n,\n2\u03c0\n\n(4.10)\n\nin terms of the K\u00e4hler form J = JH H with K\u00e4hler parameter JH . In the resolved fourfold\nX \u266f the corresponding background flux G\u266f is given by26\nG\u266f\n1\n1\n= [S \u266f ] + H\u0303 2 \u2208 H 4 (X \u266f , Z) ,\n2\u03c0\n3\n3\n\n(4.11)\n\nexpressed in terms of the four-form [S \u266f ] dual to the surface (3.2) and the two-form class\nH\u0303 induced from the hyperplane class H in P6 . As [S \u266f ] is orthogonal to H\u0303 2 , the tadpole\ncondition (2.2) yields again the M2 brane number M \u266f = 98. Furthermore, the flux (4.11)\ngenerates a twisted superpotential of the form\nf\u266f = 1\nW\n2\n\nZ\n\nX\u266f\n\nG\u266f\n2\n\u2227 J \u2227 J = JH\n+ 10JH JF ,\n2\u03c0\n\n(4.12)\n\nwith the K\u00e4hler form J = JH H\u0303 + JF [F ], where JF is the volume of the P1 fiber F of the\nfibration S \u266f . The first term corresponds to the twisted superpotential (4.10) also appearing\nin the fourfold X \u266d . The second term arises in the extremal transition in the vicinity of the\ngenus 76 curve C, as discussed in the context of the local geometries in Section 3. This is\nthe contribution in (3.54) for the torsion class k \u266f = 50.\n26\n\nDespite the overall factor of\n\n1\n,\n3\n\na closer analysis reveals that\n\ncompatible with the quantization condition (2.1).\n\n41\n\nG\u266f\n2\u03c0\n\nis actually integral and thus\n\n\fHence, the factorization \u01eb(x) = \u01eb5 (x)\u01eb1 (x) realizes a local extremal M-theory transition\nscenario along a genus 76 curve C with torsion class k \u266d = k \u266f = 50. However, in addition\nf\u266d and\nto the potential terms arising in the vicinity of the local transition geometries X\nf\u266f , we find an additional overall twisted superpotential term, which we attribute to the\nX\n\nchosen realization of the global embedding fourfolds X \u266d and X \u266f . As we review and discuss\n\nin section 5, twisted superpotentials yield Chern-Simons terms in the 3d field theory, and\nmixed terms, involving one dynamical and one background field, have the interpretation\n2\nof a FI term in the low-energy field theory. Then, in (4.12), the first term \u223c JH\nis a\n\ngenuine global effect present on both sides of the transition, while the second term has an\ninterpretation as a non-zero FI-term in the 3d field theory. For the above choice of global\nflux, the transition will therefore be obstructed, even in the field theory sense. This is in\naccord with the fact that again one needs 8 more M2 branes on X \u266f with flux (4.11) as in\nthe vacuum with zero flux.

M-theory transitions via the Clemens\u2013Schmid exact sequence\nWe will now compare the topology and Hodge structures on X \u266f and X \u266d using the\nClemens\u2013Schmid exact sequence, which is reviewed in Appendix D.1 and demonstrated\nfor Calabi\u2013Yau threefold conifold transitions in Appendix D.2. To apply this to our fourfold extremal transition, we must first construct a semistable degeneration. Here, such a\ndegeneration is a certain (smooth) fibration of Calabi\u2013Yau fourfolds over a disk \u2206, where\na normal-crossing component of the singular central fiber is birational equivalent to the\nresolved fourfold X \u266f , while the non-central (smooth) fourfold fibers describe the deformed\nCalabi\u2013Yau fourfold X \u266d . With the constructed semistable degeneration the Clemens\u2013\nSchmid exact sequence allows us to calculate the change in Hodge structure as we go\nthrough the extremal fourfold transition. The details of this computation are relegated to\nAppendix D.3, and we now summarize the result of this analysis.\nBy transitioning from the central fiber of the constructed semi-stable degeneration (D.10) to deformed Calabi\u2013Yau geometry X \u266d of the generic smooth fiber, we arrive\nat the Hodge diamond (D.14) of the fourfold X \u266d :\n1\n0\n\n0\n1,1\n\nhX \u266f \u2212 1\n\n0\n2,1\n\ndim H p,q (X \u266d ) =\n\n3,1\n\n2,1\n2,2\n\n2,1\n\n2,1\n\n2,1\n\n3,1\n\n2,1\n\nhX \u266f \u2212 h\u0303\n\n2,1\n1,1\nhX \u266f\n\n0\n\n0\nhX \u266f \u2212 h\u0303 +g\n\n2,1\n\nhX \u266f \u2212 h\u0303\n\n0\n\n2,1\n\nhX \u266f \u2212 2h\u0303 +4g \u2212 4\n\nhX \u266f \u2212 h\u0303 +g\n\n1\n\n2,1\n\nhX \u266f \u2212 h\u0303\n\nhX \u266f \u2212 h\u0303\n\n0\n\n0\n\n2,1\n\n\u22121\n\n0\n\n1\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n(4.14)\n44\n\n\fHere we express the Hodge diamond of X \u266d in terms of the Hodge numbers hp,q\nof the\nX\u266f\nresolved Calabi\u2013Yau fourfold X \u266f . The number h\u03032,1 refers to the number of harmonic (2, 1)forms participating in the extremal transition. They are in the image of the canonical map\nH 2,1 (X \u266f ) \u2192 H 2,1 (S \u266f ) and therefore disappear with the cycle S \u266f , as we go through the\nextremal transition form X \u266f to X \u266d . By comparing with the topological properties of the\nconifold transition we can now also identify the number b\u03033 of non-trivial three-cycles \u03a3\u266fk\nof X \u266f in Fig. 5 with the number h\u03032,1 of participating (2, 1)-forms according to\nb\u03033 = h\u03032,1 + h\u03031,2 = 2 h\u03032,1 .\n\n(4.15)\n\nFurthermore, we can associate the remaining (h2,1\n\u2212 h\u03032,1 ) three-forms as part of the comX\u266f\nplementary space X c (c.f., eq. (4.13)). Hence, they arise as non-trivial three-forms in both\nfourfold geometries X \u266d and X \u266f . Finally, we note that the determined Hodge diamond\n(4.14) yields the characteristic change of Hodge numbers advertised in eqs. (2.5).\n4.4. G-flux quantization condition\nIn the following we consider the change of G-flux quantization during an extremal\ntransition X \u266f to X \u266d , where the four-cycle S \u266f with self-intersection S \u266f .S \u266f = 2 \u2212 2g < 0\nshrinks and disappears from H4 (X \u266f , Z).27 The algebraic cycle S \u266f need not be a generator of\nthe homology lattice H4 (X \u266f , Z), but instead it could be homologous to a linear combination\nof generators of H4 (X \u266f , Z). However, for the considered transition S \u266f is the only fourcycle vanishing in the resolved geometry X \u266f (see Fig. 5). As a result, for the extremal\n\u266f\n\u266f\nwith S \u266f \u223c l S1/l\ntransitions under consideration S \u266f can only be a multiple of generator S1/l\n\nin homology. As result the self-intersection of S \u266f must factor as 2 \u2212 2g = l2 m, and we have\n\u266f\n\u266f\n= m. Furthermore, as the intersection pairing of H4 (X \u266f , Z)\n.S1/l\nintersection numbers S1/l\n\u266f\n= 1, and we can write the dual\nis unimodular, there is always a dual cycle T \u266f with T \u266f .S1/l\n\nintegral four-form as\n[T \u266f ] =\n\n1\n([S \u266f ] + \u0398) \u2208 H 4 (X \u266f , Z) ,\nm 1/l\n\n(4.16)\n\nwhere \u0398 is a four-form such that [T \u266f ] is integral. Firstly, \u0398 is integral itself because\nR\n\u266f\n\u266f\nbecause S \u266f [T \u266f ] =\n] are integral. Secondly, \u0398 is orthogonal to S1/l\nboth m[T \u266f ] and [S1/l\n1/l\n\n\u266f\n= 1.\nT \u266f .S1/l\n27\n\nFor a discussion of the quantization condition in F-theory on elliptic fibrations, see\n\nrefs. [49,54,20,55].\n\n45\n\n\fIn order to determine consistent G-flux, we need to look at the second Chern class of\n\u266f\n\nX . The second Chern class of X \u266f takes the following form\n\u266f\n] \u2212 l \u0398 + \u2206c2 ,\nc2 (X \u266f ) = \u2212l m [T \u266f ] + \u2206c2 = \u2212l [S1/l\n\nwhere the integral piece \u2206c2 must be orthogonal to S \u266f to yield\n\nR\n\nc (X\nS\u266f 2\n\u266f\n\n(4.17)\n\u266f\n\n)=\n\nR\n\n2g \u2212 2 in agreement with eq. (3.12). Then we make for the G-flux G the ansatz\nG\u266f\n\u2206G\n= \u03ba [T \u266f ] +\n,\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n\nf\u266f ) =\n\nc (X\nS\u266f 2\n\n\u03ba\u2208Z,\n\n(4.18)\n\nwith \u2206G orthogonal to T \u266f such that the quantization condition (2.1) is fulfilled. Note that\n\u03ba is integrally quantized because l m in eq. (4.17) is even.\nf\u266f the cycle T \u266f reduces to l copies of the non-compact cycles\nIn the local geometry X\n\n(3.26). Therefore, the flux G\u266f corresponds to the local torsion class k \u266f = \u03ba l, whereas the\nf\u266f . As a\nflux \u2206G is attributed to the complement X c of the non-compact local geometry X\n\nside remark, we observe here that the global embedding geometry X \u266f restricts the globally\npossible torsion classes to multiples of l where l must obey l2 | \u03c7(C).\n\nAs we go through the extremal transition to X \u266d the second Chern class (4.17) becomes\nc2 (X \u266d ) = \u2212l \u0398 + \u2206c2 ,\n\n(4.19)\n\nbecause the contributions \u0398 and \u2206c2 are associated to the complementary geometry X c ,\nand, as we transition to X \u266d , we (generically) do not generate any new holomorphic fourforms that could contribute to the the second Chern class c2 (X \u266d ).

Its structure, however, is constraint by the local tadpole\ncondition (3.36) examined in detail in Section 3. In particular, requiring no change in the\nnumber of space-time filling M2 branes along the transition, we get further constraints on\nthe choice of [B\u266d ].\n4.5. Non-Abelian gauge groups and relation to F-theory\nThe topology changing transitions considered in the previous sections proceed via Higgsing of a U (1) factor in the gauge group, with the gauge field arising from the three-form\nreduced on the P1 fiber over the curve C on the resolved side. This can be generalized in a\nstraightforward way to phase transitions that involve singularities with several intersecting\nP1 , leading to non-Abelian gauge groups with various matter representations.29\nA comprehensive study of the relevant fourfold singularities in the context of F-theory\nand twisted 8-dimensional SYM has appeared in refs. [17,18,19]. The essential local geometry is that of an ADE singularity (possibly with monodromy) over a surface SG \u2208 X \u266f ,\nwhich is enhanced over a matter curve C \u2282 SG . For the F-theory compactification on\n28\n\nUsing long exact Mayer-Vietoris singular homology sequences for the topological surgeries\n\nf\u266d , we can argue that we can always find a form B\u266d such that T\u00b1\u266d\nf\u266f and X \u266d = X c \u222a X\nX = Xc \u222a X\n\u266f\n\nbecomes integral.\n29\n\nParallel discussions for the case of Calabi\u2013Yau threefold singularities can be found e.g. in\n\nrefs. [4,5,56,57,58,59,10]\n\n47\n\n\fa fourfold X to four dimensions, X has to be elliptically fibered and this is related to\nM-theory on X by S 1 compactification. The existence of an elliptic fibration in the compactification of the normal bundle to SG restricts the possible gauge and matter content,30\nbut is otherwise inessential to the local analysis of the gauge theory engineered by the\nlocal singularity. The results of our M-theory analysis is therefore slightly more general,\nbut directly applicable to the F-theory compactification to four dimensions, if the 3d spectrum fulfills the four-dimensional anomaly constraints and an elliptic fibration exists. In\nparticular the M-theory picture must reproduce the results of refs. [17,18] in this case and\nwe will indeed see explicitly in Section 5 that this is the case for the spectrum obtained\nfrom a topological twist in M-theory.\nAs discussed above, a topological transition to a deformed manifold X \u266d in the presence\nof consistently quantized fluxes describes a motion along a flat direction in the parameter\nspace of the non-Abelian space-time gauge theory associated with this local geometry.\nAlternatively, this can be viewed as a microscopic engineering of a G bundle over the\nsurface SG in the internal Calabi\u2013Yau space.\nAs is clear from the analysis of [17,18], the spectrum and the superpotential couplings\nwill depend very much on the details of a concrete geometry, and in particular on the\nchoice of quantized G-flux, which captures topological data of the gauge bundle on SG\nin the F-theory picture. Instead of trying to be general we restrict here to illustrate the\napplication of the results of the M-theory analysis on topological transitions in a simple\nnon-Abelian example.\nOur non-Abelian example is a SU (6) gauge theory that repoduces the sextic compactification of Section 4.1 as the end point of a chain of topology changing transitions. For\nthe engineering of the SU (6) gauge group, we need an A5 surface singularity with local\nequation\nxy + z 6 = 0 .\n\n(4.25)\n\nThe engineering of global elliptic fibrations with the appropriate singularities is wellunderstood, but the requirement of X being elliptic leads to slightly more complicated\ngeometries then needed for our purposes. To study the 3d physics associated with the\ntransition it suffices to study the case without elliptic fibration. Since the difference is not\n30\n\nAs is expected from the fact that the constraints from four-dimensional anomalies are more\n\nrestrictive then those from Z2 anomalies in three dimensions.\n\n48\n\n\fessential for the local physics we will anyway often comment on the F-theory picture and\nheavily borrow from the results of [17,18].31\nTo make contact with the sextic example, we identify x and z with the homogeneous\ncoordinates x5 , x6 on P6 and y with a degree 5 polynomial p5 (xi ) depending only on the\nother coordinates xi , i = 1, ..., 4. Equation (4.25) then describes an A5 singularity over a\nquintic hypersurface SG : p5 (xi ) = 0 in P3 (x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 ) with Hodge numbers\nh0,0 (SG ) = 1 ,\n\nh1,0 (SG ) = 0 ,\n\nh1,1 (SG ) = 45 ,\n\nh2,0 (SG ) = 4 ,\n\n\u03c7(SG ) = 55 . (4.26)\n\nMore generally, an Ak\u22121 singularity over SG gives rise to a G = SU (k) gauge theory\nin 3d with h2,0 = 4 chiral multiplets in the adjoint representation [60][17].

As alluded to above, the local geometry is almost identical to the\nmatter curves representing intersecting 7-branes in an F-theory compactification, except\nfor the absence of a global elliptic fibration. The topological twist and the spectrum for this\nlocal geometry has been computed in ref. [17], and is reproduced by the results reported\nin Sections 5.3 and 5.5.\nIn the M-theory compactification on Xk , a generic point in the K\u00e4hler moduli corresponds naively to a Coulomb branch of G, where the gauge symmetry is broken to\n50\n\n\fG = U (1)rk G . Moreover there is a common bare mass for the fundamentals proportional\nto the volume of the single extra P1 in the resolution of the Ak singularity over Ck , which\nagain represents a Coulomb vev for the U (1) associated with the single mass parameter.\nExcept for a possible obstruction from the flux configuration, the moduli spaces of two\nmanifolds Xk+1 and Xk can be connected by a topology changing transition, where the\nextra P1 over Ck+1 \u2282 Xk+1 shrinks, each step giving rise to a local conifold transition of\nthe type described in Section 3. The change in the Hodge numbers in (4.30) in each step\nis of the expected form\n\u2206h1,1 = +1 ,\n\n\u2206h3,1 = \u2212g ,\n\n\u2206h2,2 = \u22124(g \u2212 1) ,\n\n\u2206\u03c7 = \u22126(g \u2212 1) .\n\n(4.33)\n\nIn F-theory language, transitions of this type describes a process, where a stack of parallel\n7-branes is deformed to a set of intersecting branes, which recombine under addition of\nfluxes [17,21].\nThe spectrum of the 3d theory obtained from the local A5 singularity over SG in X6\nis that of an SU (6) theory with 4 adjoint chiral multiplets. Giving a vev to scalars in\nthe Cartan subalgebra breaks SU (6) \u2192 U (1)5 . There are two different types of Coulomb\nbranches depending on whether the scalars J a in the 3d vector multiplet or the scalars\nz \u03b1 in the chiral multiplet get a vev. The second branch is also available in the F-theory\ncompactification (if the global embedding X would be chosen to be elliptic) and then\ndescribes a deformation of parallel 7-branes to intersecting 7-branes [17].\nIn the partial resolutions (4.30), the Cartan part of the adjoint fields correspond to\nthe non-polynomial deformations h3,1\nnp , which are frozen in the hypersurface representation\nand can not be represented by coefficients in Pk in the given representation of Xk as a\nhypersurface in P[\u2206k ]. The number of non-polynomial deformations h3,1\nnp in (4.30) matches\nthe number 4 * rk(G) of neutral components of the four adjoint hypermultiplets. Indeed\nthe difference in the hypersurface equations for X6 and X5 is that the 4 coefficients of the\n(0)\n\npolynomial p1\n\n\u2208 \u0393(KSG ) are set to zero in X6 . Since the adjoint chiral multiplet are\n\nsections of the canonical bundle KSG , these coefficients should be identified with a vev\nfor the 4 chiral multiplets lying in a U (1) \u2282 SU (6) subgroup. Thus the moduli of the\nhypersurface X6 with 20 frozen deformations describes a pure 3d Coulomb-branch U (1)5\nwith vev's only of the 3d vector multiplet J a , while the transition to X5 describes moving\nfrom a pure 3d C-branch to a mixed U (1)4 \u00d7 U (1)z Coulomb-branch, where the subscript\nz denotes a non-zero vev of a neutral scalar in the chiral multiplet.\n51\n\n\f(0)\n\nThe zero locus of the section p1\n\ndefines a genus six curve C5 \u2282 X5 above which the\n\nsingularity enhances to A5 ; the local deformation theory for the genus six case was one of\nthe examples treated in detail in Section 3.7. M2 Branes wrapping the extra node account\nfor the charged components of the adjoint chiral multiplets with a 3d mass proportional\nto the vev in the vector multiplet. In the F-theory context, a SU (6) stack of parallel\nD7-branes is deformed to a SU (5) stack intersected by a single brane [17].\nStarting from X5 the partial resolutions are related successively by conifold transitions\nXk+1 \u2243 X \u266f \u2192 Xk \u2243 X \u266d , upon condition of appropriate background flux. Some or all of\nthe Coulomb and/or Higgs branches will be lifted, depending on the choice of consistent\nG-flux and C-fields analyzed in Section 3, leading to many components of the N = 1\ndeformation space with different spectra and disconnected in the field theory limit.

It would be interesting to work out more details for a concrete\nmodel with a phenomenological perspective. This will require also a further study of nongeneric configurations. E.g. note that if we start with zero flux on X5 and blow down\n(1)\n\n(0)\n\nthe first P1 fiber over C5 : p5 = 0 = p1 , the critical points of the superpotential on X4\ndescribe the local singularity\nX5 \u2192 X4 : xy + z 6 + p1 z 5 \u2192 xy + z 6 + p1 z 5 + p2 z 4 ,\n\n(4.38)\n\nwith p2 factorized into two linear polynomials as p2 = t1 .s1 .

The intersection points may induce further superpotential\ncouplings, as described in [17].\n\n5. M-theory phases in the effective N = 2 three-dimensional field theory\n\nIn this section, we first review aspects of N = 2 three-dimensional U (1) gauge theories with charged matter fields. We discuss the interplay among global symmetries, phase\nstructures, Chern-Simons terms and parity anomalies of such field theories. By constructing such theories by dimensional reduction of certain five-dimensional field theories with\neight supercharges, we associate the resulting three-dimensional field theories with the analyzed conifold transitions in M-theory. While completing this manuscript, the paper [63]\nappeared, which has a certain overlap with the aspects discussed in this section.\n53\n\n\f5.1. N = 2 three-dimensional field theory\nWe briefly review a few aspects, mostly following the notation of ref. [14]. The algebra\nof three dimensional N = 2 (four supercharges) admits a U (1)R symmetry32 and a real\n\u03bc\ncentral term Z, {Q\u03b1 , Q\u0304\u03b2 } = 2\u03c3\u03b1\u03b2\nP\u03bc + 2i\u01eb\u03b1\u03b2 Z, with all other anticommutators vanishing.\n\nThe matter multiplets are in chiral33 superfields X, similar to those of 4d N = 1, [Q\u0304\u03b1 , X] =\n0, with CPT conjugate anti-chiral superfields X\u0304, with [Q\u03b1 , X\u0304] = 0.\nConsidering, say a U (1)r Abelian34 gauge theory, with vector multiplets V a ,\na = 1, . . . , r, one can form associated linear multiplets \u03a3a = \u01eb\u03b1\u03b2 D\u0304\u03b1 D\u03b2 V a , with D2 \u03a3a =\nD\u03042 \u03a3a = 0, i.e. the same as for a conserved current, D2 J = D\u03042 J = 0. Indeed, abelian\ngauge fields lead to U (1)J global conserved currents, j \u03bc = \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 F\u03bd\u03c1 , that shifts the scalar\ndual of the photon, with \u03a3 the corresponding superspace conserved current. The bottom\ncomponents of \u03a3a are the real scalars of the Coulomb branch, \u03a3a | = J a .35\nThe lagrangian terms involving the gauge multiplet include\nLN=2 \u2283\n\nZ\n\n\u0012\n\nkab a b\nd \u03b8 \u03c4ab \u03a3 \u03a3 + V Ja +\n\u03a3 V\n4\u03c0\n4\n\na\n\nb\n\na\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(5.1)\n\n(summing repeated indices) where \u03c4 \u223c g \u22122 give the gauge kinetic terms, and kab give the\nN = 2 supersymmetric Chern-Simons terms:\n1\nkab \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 a b\n1\na\nF b \u03bc\u03bd + 12 \u03c4ab \u2202\u03bc J a \u2202 \u03bc J b +\n\u01eb A\u03bc F\u03bd\u03c1 \u2212 2 kac kbd \u03c4 cd J a J b .

Also similar to 4d, the coupling of the\nreal scalar in the N = 2 vector multiplet (the A4 component in reducing from 4d) distinguishes\nbetween 3d chiral superfield matter in representations r vs r\u0304. So, much as in 4d, we can distinguish\nbetween vector-like (real or r \u2295 r\u0304) vs chiral matter representations in 3d N = 2 theories.\n34\n\nThe non-Abelian case is similar, since the gauge group is anyway broken to the Cartan U (1)r\n\non the Coulomb branch. We will briefly remark about the differences for the non-Abelian case.\nOne difference, for the case of non-Abelian N = 2 pure Yang-Mills, with no matter, is that\ninstantons generate a non-perturbative, runaway superpotential that lifts the Coulomb branch\n[24]. For non-Abelian gauge theories with matter, instantons have too many fermion zero modes\nto generate a superpotential, though there can be other non-perturbative effects, see e.g. [14].\n35\n\nNote that we refer to the bottom component of \u03a3 by the roman letter J , whereas we use the\n\ncalligraphic letter J for the conserved currents.\n\n54\n\n\fThe Chern-Simons terms give masses \u223c kab to the gauge fields, and the last term in\n(5.2) give supersymmetry-preserving superpartner masses to the J a , lifting the Coulomb\nbranch. The N = 2 Chern-Simons terms in (5.1) can be expressed in terms of the \"twisted\nf (\u03a3) = 1 kab \u03a3a \u03a3b ,36 where the term in Lagrangian is\nsuperpotential\" W\n2\n\nLN=2 \u2283\n\nZ\n\nf (\u03a3) V a .\nd4 \u03b8 \u2202a W\n\n(5.3)\n\nThe V a Ja sum in (5.1) can include both dynamical gauge fields coupled to gauge\ncurrents, and also background gauge fields coupled to any global currents; for background\ngauge fields, \u03c4ai \u2192 \u221e, and \u03a3i \u223c m\u0303 coupling to a global symmetry gives the real mass\nR\nterm parameters, m\u0303. Fayet-Iliopoulous terms d4 \u03b8 \u03bea V a can be regarded as mixed ChernSimons couplings between the dynamical field V a and a background field \u03a3i , \u03bea \u223c kai \u03a3i .\nThe central term Z can get contributions from real mass terms or FI terms,\nZ =\n\nX\n\nqi m\u0303i ,\n\n(5.4)\n\ni\n\nwhere qi is the charge of the field under a global U (1)i symmetry, m\u0303i is the real mass that\ncan be regarded as a U (1)i background field, m\u0303i = \u03a3i |, and the sum includes U (1)J , with\nmJ = \u03be the FI parameter.\nThe N = 2 supersymmetric Chern-Simons term coefficients kab in (5.1) to (5.3) include\nboth classical and one-loop contributions,\ntotal\ncl\nkab\n= kab\n+\n\n1X\n(qf )a (qf )b sign(Mf ) ,\n2\n\n(5.5)\n\nf\n\nwhere f runs over all fermions, (qf )a is its charge under U (1)a and Mf is its real mass,\nincluding the contribution from the J a expectation values on the Coulomb branch, Mf =\nP\ntotal\nm\u0303f + a (qf )a J a . There is a quantization condition kab\n\u2208 Z or 12 Z.37\n36\n\nAgain, f\nW (\u03a3) is not a superpotential in 3d, since \u03a3 is real, but reduces in 2d to a superpo-\n\ntential for twisted chiral superfields.\n37\n\nFor non-Abelian groups, gauge invariance quantizes k total , independent of any details. For\n\nAbelian groups, the quantization relies on having compact U (1)s, and considering the theory on\na compact spacetime X3 , with the normalization of the gauge field specified via\n\nH\n\nA \u2208 2\u03c0 Z. The\n\nquantization condition depends on X3 : if X3 is restricted to be spin, as is required for compactification of M -theory (or having fermions for that matter), one gets k \u2208\n\n1\n2\n\nZ; the half-integer\n\ncase is is referred to as Abelian spin-Chern-Simons [64,65]. This is similar to compactification of\nM-theory to 5d, where the spin restriction on X5 gives ctotal \u2208 Z (rather than c \u2208 6Z).\n\n55\n\n\fIf the charged matter spectrum representation is vector-like, with all matter chiral\nsuperfields in real or r \u2295 r\u0304 representations, the induced Chern-Simons term vanishes. For\nexample, for U (1) with chiral matter of charge +1 and \u22121, the conjugate fields have\nopposite sign(Mf ) and make canceling contributions to (5.5). This can also be understood\nin terms of the non-renormalization theorems given in ref. [14] related to the non-coupling\nof chiral vs linear multiplets: the Chern-Simons term cannot depend on chiral multiplets, so\nit cannot depend on complex masses which is a background chiral multiplet. So vector-like\nmatter can be decoupled with arbitrarily large complex mass mC , with (5.5) unaffected. In\nthe non-Abelian case, the induced Chern-Simons term on the Coulomb branch is related to\nP\nthe cubic Casimir, essentially k = k cl + 21 f d3 (rf ) [14], where the sum runs over all chiral\n\nsuperfields. See ref. [66] for a detailed discussion and the more precise statement. The\n\nupshot is a connection between the one-loop induced Chern-Simons terms of the 3d theory\nand the 4d Tr F 3 gauge anomaly: the 3d induced Chern-Simons term vanishes precisely if\nthe matter content would be gauge anomaly free in 4d.\n5.2. Effective N = 2 field theory for M-theory on smooth fourfolds with flux\nM-theory compactified on a smooth Calabi\u2013Yau fourfold (with or without flux) yields\nat low energies three-dimensional N = 2 \u2013 i.e., four supercharges \u2013 supergravity coupled\nto matter and vector multiplets. As shown in refs. [29,15,67], reducing eleven-dimensional\nsupergravity, along with the additional eleven-dimensional M-theory C \u2227 G \u2227 G and C \u2227 X8\nand purely gravitational interactions, leads to the N = 2 three-dimensional supergravity\nLagrangian for the U (1)h\n\n1,1\n\nCoulomb branch moduli J a , with gauge kinetic terms and\n\nChern-Simons terms as in (5.1). In particular, three-dimensional Chern-Simons terms\narise from the reduction of the M-theory eleven-dimensional Chern-Simons term C \u2227 G \u2227 G\non fourfold compactifications with non-trivial four-form background fluxes G [68,67]\nZ\nG\nf\n\u2227 \u03c9a \u2227 \u03c9b ,\n(5.6)\nkab = \u2202a \u2202b W =\nX 2\u03c0\nwhere \u03c9a is a basis for H 1,1 (X, Z). The quantization condition is kab \u2208 Z or kab \u2208 Z +\n\n1\n2\n\nwhere the latter possibility is because, as discussed in the above footnote, the 3d spacetime\nis necessarily a spin manifold.

Singularities, charged matter, and the 5d \u2192 3d reduction\nThe smooth-fourfold theory of the previous subsection is a three dimensional abelian\ngauge theory, without charged matter. Geometric singularities are needed to obtain nonAbelian groups or charged matter. In our construction of the fourfold as coming from\na threefold that is fibered over a genus g curve C, we can take the shrinking P1 in the\nthreefold fiber to be very small compared with the curve C, i.e. writing the K\u00e4hler class\nJ = JF + JC for the sizes of the threefold fiber and the curve C, respectively, we can\nconsider the limit JF \u226a JC , which leads to the mass hierarchy M11d\u21925d \u226b M5d\u21923d . The\nthree-dimensional matter spectrum can then be analyzed by first reducing M-theory on\nthe threefold, which yields a low-energy five dimensional N = 1 (eight supercharge) theory.\nThe five dimensional gauge theory is next reduced (fibered) over the curve C to reduce to\nthe three-dimensional N = 2 (four supercharge) theory.\nLet us briefly outline how the latter reduction works, for a general five-dimensional\nN = 1 gauge theory, reduced to three dimensions on a genus g curve C. The fivedimensional theory in flat spacetime would have SO(4, 1) \u00d7 SU (2)R isometry group, and\nreduction on C breaks SU (4, 1) \u2192 SO(2, 1) \u00d7 U (1)L , where the eight supercharges of\nfive-dimensions transform in the (2s , \u00b1 21 , 2) of SO(2, 1) \u00d7 U (1)L \u00d7 SU (2)R . Four of these\nsupercharges are preserved if the theory is twisted, modifying the U (1)L factor of the\nLorentz group to U (1)\u2032L , with generator\nJL\u2032 = JL + J3\nwhere JL is the 2d U (1)L generator, J3 =\n\n1\n2 \u03c33\n\n(5.7)\n\nis the Cartan generator of SU (2)R , and\n\nthe preserved supercharges have JL\u2032 = 0. The four preserved supercharges have a threedimensional U (1)R symmetry, with generator given by R3d = 2JL , so the four supercharges\ntransform under SO(2, 1) \u00d7 U (1)R as (2s , \u00b11).\nThe five-dimensional N = 1 (eight supercharge) fields are\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nA\u03bc\n5d-vector = \uf8ed \u03bb\n\u03c8\uf8f8 ,\n5d-hyper = \uf8ed q+\n\u03c6R\n57\n\n\u03c8q +\n\u03c8q\u2020\u2212\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\u2020 \uf8f8\n,\nq\u2212\n\n(5.8)\n\n\fwhere SU (2)R acts on the rows, with J3 = \u00b1 12 . All 5d spinors in (5.8) reduce as \u03c8 d=5 \u2192\n\u2032\n\nd=2\nd=2\nd=3\nd=2\n(\u03c8\u03b1d=3 \u2297 \u03c8+\n) \u2295 (\u03c8\u03b1d=3 \u2297 \u03c8\u2212\n), where \u03c8\u03b1=1,2\nis a two-component 3d spinor and \u03c8\u00b1\nis\n\na 2d spinor of U (1)L Lorentz charge JL = \u00b1 12 .\nConsider first reducing the 5d-vector multiplet in (5.8) on C. Collecting the fields\naccording to their U (1)L\u2032 spin (5.7), there are fields with JL\u2032 = 0, which assemble into a\n3d N = 2 vector multiplet. There are also fields with JL\u2032 = \u00b11, which assemble into a\n3d N = 2, adjoint valued chiral multiplet. Reducing on C, the U (1)L\u2032 = 0 fields yield a\nmassless 3d, N = 2 vector multiplet, from the constant mode on C (along with a massive\ntower from the other modes of the laplacian on C). The JL\u2032 = \u00b11 fields are 1-forms on\nthe curve C, e.g. Az,z\u0304 = A4 \u00b1 iA5 , and thus the C laplacian zero modes are given by the\ng holomorphic and g anti-holomorphic 1-forms on C. We thus obtain, in addition to the\n3d N = 2 massless vector multiplet, g additional massless, 3d N = 2 chiral multiplets,\n\u03c6i=1...g , in the adjoint representation of the gauge group G. The scalar components of\nthese g chiral multiplets \u03c6i come from the g holomorphic 1-form Az components of the\nfive dimensional gauge field on C.39 The coupling of Az to charged matter implies that\n\u03c6i have superpotential couplings to charged matter in three dimensions. For g = 1,\nthe supersymmetry is enhanced to three dimensional N = 4 and \u03a6 is the adjoint chiral\nsuperfield of the N = 4 vector multiplet.\nNow consider reducing a five dimensional matter hypermultiplets in (5.8) on C. Collecting the fields according to their U (1)L\u2032 spin, we find a 3d N = 2 chiral superfield, q+ ,\nin some representation r of the gauge group, with U (1)L\u2032 spin JL\u2032 = + 12 , and a 3d N = 2\nchiral superfield q\u2212 , in conjugate representation r of the gauge group, with U (1)L\u2032 spin\nJL\u2032 = 12 . Upon reducing on C, we get massless 3d chiral superfields from the zero modes\nof the two-dimensional Dirac operator on C with U (1)L\u2032 spin \u00b1 12 . The five-dimensional\nhypermultiplet thus reduces to massless three-dimensional chiral multiplets as:\nf =1...N+\n\n(5d \u2212 hyper) \u2192 q+\n\nf \u0303=1...N\u2212\n\n\u2295 q\u2212\n\n,\n\n(5.9)\n\nwhere N\u00b1 are the numbers of U (1)L spin \u00b1 21 fermion zero modes of the two-dimensional\nDirac operator in representation r:\nf =1...N+\n\nD\n/ 2 \u03c7+\n39\n\nf \u0303=1...N\u2212\n\n= 0,\n\nD\n/ 2 \u03c7\u2212\n\n= 0.\n\nIndeed, the 2g real scalars in these multiplets are the 2g Wilson loops\n\nthe 2g one-cycles associated with the four-cycles An in Fig. 1.\n\n58\n\n(5.10)\nH\n\n\u03b1n\n\nA, where \u03b1n are\n\n\fFor example, for a U (1) gauge group and a 5d hypermultiplet of charge 1, the reduction\non a genus g curve C yields the three-dimensional spectrum given by:\n3d N = 2 multiplet\nVector multiplet V\n\nneutral chiral\nmultiplets \u03c6i\ni = 1, . . . , g\ncharged chiral\nf\nmultiplets q+\nf = 1, . . . , N+\n\n3d field\n\u03c6\n\u03bb0\n\u03bb\u20320\nA\u03bc\ni\n\u03c6 = Aiz\n\u03bbiz\n\u03bbiz\u0304\nf\nq+\n\u03c8qf+\nf\n\u03c8 \u2032 q+\n\nSO(2, 1)\n1\n2s\n2s\n3\n1\n2s\n2s\n1\n2s\n2s\n\nU (1)g\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n+1\n+1\n+1\n\ncharged chiral\n\nf\nq\u2212\n\n1\n\n\u22121\n\n0\n\n \u0303\n\u03c8qf\u2212\nf \u0303\n\u03c8 \u2032 q\u2212\n\n2s\n\n\u22121\n\n\u22121\n\n2s\n\n\u22121\n\n1\n\n \u0303\n\nf \u0303\nq\u2212\n\nmultiplets\nf \u0303 = 1, . . . , N\u2212\n\nU (1)R\n0\n+1\n\u22121\n0\n2\n1\n\u22121\n0\n\u22121\n1\n\n(5.11)\n\nThe multiplicities N\u00b1 of the charged chiral multiplets are governed by the zero-modes\nof the two-dimensional Dirac operator on C twisted by the background flux FC . Note also\nthat the gauge covariant derivatives in (5.10) contain the gauge connection on C, so the\nfermion zero modes are affected by the expectation values of the g, gauge adjoint chiral\nmultiplets \u03c6i=1...g that came from the 5d vector multiplet. Non-zero expectation values of\n \u0303\n\nf\nf\nthe \u03c6i=1...g can give 3d complex masses to pairs q+\n, q\u2212\n. In terms of the 3d gauge theory\n\nobtained by dimensional reduction on C, this effect is accounted for by a superpotential,\nW =\n\ng N+ N\u2212\nXX\nX\n\n \u0303\n\nf i f\ncif f \u0303 Tr q+\n\u03c6 q\u2212\n\n(5.12)\n\ni=1 f =1 f \u0303=1\n\nwith Tr over the gauge indices. For the case of g = 1, where supersymmetry is enhanced,\nthis is the expected superpotential of 3d N = 4 supersymmetric gauge theories. The\nconstants cif f \u0303 can be determined by a topological calculation (independent of the metrics),\nas we will exhibit shortly in the connection with M-theory. The 3d complex masses obtained\nfrom (5.12) for non-zero h\u03c6i i affects the phase structure of the 3d field theory, for example\nlifting Higgs branch moduli.\n59\n\n\fWhile the solutions (5.10) and the numbers N\u00b1 depend on the \u03c6i moduli, the difference\nN+ \u2212 N\u2212 is the topological index that's independent of the \u03c6i moduli (since h\u03c6i i gives\ncomplex masses to pairs, q+ and q\u2212 in pairs). This index is that of the two-dimensional\nDirac operator on C twisted by the background flux FC . In particular, for the case of a\nU (1) gauge theory,\nindex(/\nD2 ) = N+ \u2212 N\u2212 =\n\nZ\n\nC\n\nFC\n= n(1 \u2212 g) .\n2\u03c0\n\n(5.13)\n\nThe FC flux in (5.13) corresponds to a magnetic monopole and is thus quantized (see e.g.\nsection 14.4 in ref. [69]) as A\u03b1 = 12 n\u03c9\u03b1 , where \u03c9\u03b1 is the U (1)L spin connection on C and\nn is an integer unit of flux. For g = 1 there is enhanced supersymmetry and the theory is\nnecessarily vector-like, fitting with the vanishing index (5.13). For g 6= 1 and n 6= 0 flux\nunits, the three-dimensional theory has chiral matter, N+ 6= N\u2212 .\n5.4. The dynamics of 3d U (1) gauge theories for general matter fields of charge \u00b11\nThe analysis in [14] focused on the vectorlike matter case, N+ = N\u2212 = Nf , noting the\nbranched moduli space of vacua, with the Higgs branch, and two distinct quantum Coulomb\nbranches, all meeting at the origin. We here generalize this to allow for N+ 6= N\u2212 .\nf =1...N+\n\nConsider a U (1) gauge theory with N+ chiral superfields q+\nN\u2212 chiral superfields\n\nf \u0303=1...N\u2212\nq\u2212\n\nq+\nq\u2212\nM\nV\u00b1\n\nof charge +1, and\n\nof charge \u22121.

The U (1)R is an R-symmetry and we could just as well have\ne (1)R = U (1)R + rU (1)A . The charges of V\u00b1\nchosen a different basis of the U (1)s, e.g. U\n\nunder the global symmetries follow from a one-loop diagram coupling the global currents\nto the gauge fields [14], and here Nf \u2261 21 (N+ + N\u2212 ).\n\nFor N+ N\u2212 6= 0, there is a N+ +N\u2212 \u22121 complex dimensional Higgs branch moduli space\nof classical vacua when Wtree = 0. The Higgs branch can be parameterized by expectation\n60\n\n\fvalues of the N\u2212 N+ meson gauge invariants, subject to their classical constraint coming\nf g\u0303\nfrom M f g\u0303 = q+\nq\u2212 :\n\nMHiggs : hM f g\u0303 i\n\nwith\n\nrank(M ) = 1.\n\n(5.15)\n\nThe case N+ = N\u2212 was discussed in [14,70]. As in that case, the moduli space generally\nseparates into three branches: The Higgs branch (5.15) with hJi = 0, and two distinct\nCoulomb branches, Coulomb\u00b1 with hM i = 0, and sign(J) = \u00b11. The quantum Coulomb\nbranches are parameterized by the chiral superfields V\u00b1 in (5.14).\nThe q+ and q\u2212 fields get real masses on the Coulomb branch, m\u0303+ + J and m\u0303\u2212 \u2212 J,\nrespectively, where m\u0303\u00b1 are in the adjoint of SU (N\u00b1 ) \u00d7 U (1)A . For vanishing real masses,\nthe Chern-Simons term on the branch Coulomb\u00b1 is given by (5.5) to be\n1\ntotal\nk\u00b1\n= k cl \u00b1 (N+ \u2212 N\u2212 )\n2\n\n(5.16)\n\nwith \u00b1 21 (N+ \u2212 N\u2212 ) the quantum contribution from integrating out the massive fields q+\nand q\u2212 fields. When N+ 6= N\u2212 , generally k total 6= 0, lifting both Coulomb branches. It\nis possible to tune k cl to leave one of the two Coulomb branches unlifted. Note that k cl\ncancels if we consider the difference of the Chern-Simons coefficient on the two Coulomb\nbranches, which is given by the topological index:\ntotal\ntotal\nk+\n\u2212 k\u2212\n= N+ \u2212 N\u2212 .\n\n(5.17)\n\nRecall first the case N+ = N\u2212 = Nf > 0, with kcl = 0 so the two Coulomb branches\nare unlifted and meet the Higgs branch at the origin. The theory at the origin flows to\nan interacting SCFT [14] that can be described by a dual effective theory of the gauge\ninvariant moduli fields in (5.14), with\nW = \u2212Nf (V+ V\u2212 det M )1/Nf .\n\n(5.18)\n\nFor Nf = 1 the dual theory (5.18) is non-singular and provides a complete dual description\nof the low-energy theory and interacting SCFT at the origin. For Nf > 1, the superpotential (5.18) is singular, corresponding to the fact that additional degrees of freedom are\nneeded to describe the interacting SCFT at the origin.\nSCFTs are generic in 3d, so anything pointing toward additional degrees of freedom\nbeyond the moduli fields can be regarded as some evidence for an interacting SCFT.\n61\n\n\fIn particular, singular moduli spaces or moduli spaces with branches are some general\nevidence pointing toward an interacting SCFT at the singularity.\nLet us now discuss the N+ 6= N\u2212 cases. For kcl = 0, the Coulomb branches are lifted\ntotal\nby the Chern-Simons terms k\u00b1\n6= 0, so the moduli space consists only of the Higgs\n\nbranch (5.15). Whenever both N+ > 1 and N\u2212 > 1, the Higgs branch (5.15) is singular\nat the origin (the classical singularity can not be smoothed by quantum effects), which\nsuggests an interacting SCFT there.\nOn the other hand, for N+ > 1 and N\u2212 = 1, the N+ dimensional Higgs branch is\ni\nsmoothly parameterized by the mesons M i = q+\nq\u2212 , so it is possible that the theory with\n\nk cl = 0, and hence lifted Coulomb branches for N+ 6= 1, is an IR free smoothly confined\ntheory of the mesons M i , without additional SCFT degrees of freedom at the origin. A\nweak test of such a scenario is the Z2 parity anomaly matching [14] analog of 't Hooft\ni\nanomaly matching for the global symmetries. The microscopic fields (q+\nand q\u2212 and the\n\nU (1) multiplet) in (5.14) give kRR = 12 N+ , kRA = kAA = 12 (N+ + 1) mod integers. The\nMi low energy fields give kRR =\n\n1\nN ,\n2 +\n\nkRA = 0, kAA = 0 mod integers. So the parity\n\nanomalies involving U (1)A do not match for N+ even, suggesting again an interacting\nSCFT at the origin in that case. Only N+ odd and N\u2212 = 1 might have an IR free theory\nof mesons, rather than a SCFT.\ntotal\ntotal\nIf N+ 6= N\u2212 and k cl is tuned so that k+\nor k\u2212\nin (5.16) vanishes, then there is\n\nan unlifted Coulomb branch, intersecting the Higgs branch (5.15) at the origin, and there\nagain we expect an interacting SCFT at the intersection point on the moduli space.\n5.5. Comparing M-theory conifold transitions with 3d field theory phase structure\nReducing M-theory on the ruled surface S \u266f \u2013 as analyzed in Section 3 \u2013 actually\nleads to two three-dimensional U (1) gauge fields, U (1)F and U (1)C , coming from reducing\nC3 on either P1 or C in (3.2). In terms of the 11 \u2192 5 \u2192 3 reduction, C 11d \u2192 A5d \u2227\n3d\n3d\nJF + C 5d \u2192 A3d\nF \u2227 JF + AC \u2227 JC . The U (1)F gauge field AF comes from the five-\n\ndimensional gauge field A5d , while U (1)C comes from the five-dimensional C 5d 3-form\ngauge field. We are interested in the JF \u226a JC limit where the interesting dynamics is\nin the U (1)F gauge theory, and we can take a low-energy limit where the U (1)C gauge\ntheory essentially decouples, together with the gravity multiplet (it comes from C 5d , in\nthe five-dimensional gravity multiplet). The point is that U (1)F has light charged matter,\nfrom M2 branes wrapping the small P1 , whereas all matter charged under U (1)C is much\n62\n\n\fheavier for JC \u226b JF , as it gets a large real mass m\u0303 \u223c JC on the Coulomb branch. It is\nin this limit that we make contact with the three-dimensional field theory associated to\nthe spectrum (5.11). Let us know discuss how this correspondence between the M-theory\ngeometry and the discussed 3d field theory comes about.\nAs we discussed above, the numbers N\u00b1 of massless 3d chiral superfields, coming from\nthe solutions of the Dirac operator zero modes (5.10), are determined by the number of\nflux units, with index given by (5.13). Lifting the 5d gauge theory results to M -theory on\nS \u266f , the background flux FC arises from integrating out the P1 -fibers. We therefore identify\nthe index (5.13) with the torsion classes in eq. (3.41)\nZ\n\nS\u266f\n\nG\u266f\n=\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nC\n\nFC\n2\u03c0\n\n\u21d2\n\nk \u266f = k \u266d = N+ \u2212 N\u2212 = index(/\nD2 ) .\n\n(5.19)\n\nThe moduli dependence of zero modes (5.10) enters in the M-theory transition through\nthe dynamical obstructions induced form the flux superpotential (3.56). In particular, the\ndeformation sections (3.74), which are the global sections of the line bundles E\u00b1 in (3.72),\nare in one-to-one correspondence with the zero mode structure of the Dirac operators\n(5.10). Identifying the U (1) line bundle L with the line bundle L in eq. (3.73) arising in the\n1/2\n\nM-theory transition and using the previous definitions E+ = KC\n\n1/2\n\n\u2297 L and E+ = KC\n\n\u2297 L\u2217\n\nin eq. (3.72), we get a 1-1 correspondence\n1:1\n\nf =1,...,N\u00b1\n\nH 0 (C, E\u00b1 ) \u2190\u2192 { \u03c7\u00b1\n\n},\n\nwhich implies for the multiplicities N+ and N\u2212 of the charged chiral fields q+ and q\u2212\nN+ = h0 (C, E+ ) ,\n\nN\u2212 = h1 (C, E\u2212 ) .\n\nAs discussed in the previous sections, interacting SCFTs are generic at the origin\nof 3d N = 2 gauge theories with non-zero matter content, and in particular occur at the\ntransition point in the moduli space between Higgs and Coulomb branches. The interacting\nSCFT at the transition point has additional degrees of freedom. In the M-theory geometry\ndescription, M2 branes give a natural source for the additional degrees of freedom. Indeed,\nthere are tensionless domain walls located at the singularity, which is another tell-tale sign\nof an interacting SCFT, where the number of M2 branes can change. This is because at\nthe origin of the Higgs branch the SU (N+ ) \u00d7 SU (N\u2212 ) flavor symmetry is restored, which\n63\n\n\fimplies that there are vanishing cycles supporting tensionless domain walls with \u03b4M 6= 0\ncomputed by eq. (3.85).\nIf the 3d theory is related to a 4d theory by a circle compactification, we recover\nthe result ref. [17] in the four-dimensional theory from F-theory compactification on the\nfourfold. As in that case, the index of the charged chiral matter fields q+ and q\u2212 can be\nwritten, using Serre duality and the Riemann-Roch theorem, as\n1/2\n\nN+ \u2212 N\u2212 = h0 (C, KC\n\n1/2\n\n\u2297 L) \u2212 h1 (C, KC\n\n\u2297 L)\nZ\nFC\n1/2\n= (1 \u2212 g) + c1 (L \u2297 KC ) =\n.\nC\nC 2\u03c0\nZ\n\n(5.20)\n\nThe latter equality in the second line of (5.20) can again be directly understood as the\nstatement of the index theorem for the two-dimensional twisted Dirac operator (5.13).\nThe spectrum obtained form the dimensional reduction of the 5d multiplets (5.8) upon\nC and their associated geometric sections are summarized in the following table:\nfields\nSupercharge\nVector multiplet\n\nHypermultiplet\n\n\u2032\n\n(Q, Q )\n\u03c6\n(\u03bb, \u03c8)\nA\u03bc\nAz\n\u2020\n(q+ , q\u2212\n)\n\u03c8q +\n\u03c8q \u2212\n\nSO(2, 1)\n\nU (1)L\n\nU (1)g\n\nSU (2)R\n\nsections of\n\n2s\n1\n2s\n3\n1\n1\n2s\n2s\n\n+1/2\n0\n+1/2\n0\n+1\n0\n+1/2\n+1/2\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n+1\n+1\n\u22121\n\n2\n1\n2\n1\n1\n2\n1\n1\n\nKC\nOC\n1/2\nKC\nOC\nKC\nL\n1/2\nKC \u2297 L\n1/2\nKC \u2297 L\u2217\n\n1/2\n\n(5.21)\n\nHere (Q, Q\u2032 ) is the pair of pseudo-real spinorial supercharges of five-dimensional N = 1\nsupersymmetry. Performing the topological twist (5.7), which corresponds to tensoring\nthe sections of the fields in table (5.21) with KCJ3 according to their quantum number of\nthe Cartan generator J3 of SU (2)R , we obtain the 3d N = 2 supercharges with U (1)L\u2032\nspin J3\u2032 = 0 and arrive at the 3d spectrum of table (5.11).\nIn the geometry, the coefficients cif f \u0303 in (5.12) are determined by the integrals\nci f f \u0303 =\n\nZ\n\nC\n\n \u0303\n\n(\u01ebf+ \u01ebf\u2212 ) \u2227 \u03bc\u0304i ,\n\n(5.22)\n\nwhere \u01eb\u00b1 are the sections of E\u00b1 associated with the matter fields, and \u03bc\u0304i the (0, 1)-form\nfor the i-th Wilson line, see eq. (4.105) in ref. [17].\n64\n\n\fWith these identifications at hand we can now compare the phase structure of the discussed 3d field theory with the local M-theory geometries of Section 3. The two resolved\nf\nf\nphases X1\u266f and X2\u266f map to the two Coulomb branches with sign(\u03c6) > 0 and sign(\u03c6) < 0.\nIndeed, as computed explicitly in Appendix B, the flop transition (3.45) induces the discontinuous jump in the Chern-Simons term according to the flux-induced twisted super-\n\npotentials integrated over the two flopped volumes (3.9) and (3.14). This matches the\nexpected jump as induced form the chiral spectrum (5.5), in agreement with (5.17)\n\u2206k = index(/\nD2 ) = N+ \u2212 N\u2212 .\nIn the context of both the M-theory geometry and the associated 3d field theory, the\npresence of non-vanishing Chern-Simons couplings from twisted superpotentials lift those\nbranches geometrically in the former and field theoretically the latter description.\nf\u266d is identified with the Higgs branch of the 3d\nThe deformed M-theory geometry X\n\nfield theory. The dimension of this Higgs branch (5.15) agrees with the dimension of the\nunobstructed deformation space (3.75). In particular the factorized deformations \u01eb = \u01eb+ \u01eb\u2212\nin eq. (3.74) get mapped to the gauge invariant mesonic operators M f g\u0303 .\n\nLet us emphasize that this correspondence holds not only on the level of multiplicities\nand of dimensionality of moduli spaces, but also on the level of moduli spaces itself. In\nthe local M-theory transition the moduli of the background fluxes FC are mapped to the\nmoduli of the line bundle (3.73), while both in the 5d-to-3d reduction and in the geometric\nM-theory conifold transition, the moduli of the curve C enter through their dependence on\nthe structure of global sections. The underlying reason for this correspondence is that the\nAlbanese map of the ruled surface S \u266f gets identified with the Abel Jacobi map of the curve\nC [42], which in turn encods both the dynamically unobstructed deformation directions in\nSection 3 and the field-theoretic spectrum (5.11).\nAccordingly, as discussed in Section 3, non-zero C-field backgrounds correspond to\nnon-zero Wilson lines \u03c6i and also lift massless fields via the couplings (5.12),(5.22). If\nh2,1 (X \u266f ) = h2,1 (X \u266d ) = 0, all the fields \u03c6i are non-dynamical and their expectation values\nare fixed by the global embedding geometry. A very explicit example is provided by the\nhyperelliptic cases studied in Section 3.7, where a choice of half-integer C-field values corre1/2\n\nsponds to a choice of a particular spin structure KC . The latter will be fixed in a global\nembedding and in turn determine the actual number of holomorphic sections/massless\nfields given in eqs (3.84),(3.86). Similarly, the fields \u03c6i associated to (2, 1)-forms participating in the M-theory transition (c.f. eq. (4.15)) are dynamical and further reduce the\nHiggs branch dimension by their equations of motion, e.g., setting F\u03c6i = 0.\n65\n\n\f6. Conclusions\nWe examine topological changing transition for M-theory compactification on CalabiYau fourfolds, which give rise to three-dimensional theories with four supercharges. Compared to extremal transitions of M-theory/type II string compactifications on Calabi-Yau\nthreefolds, which result in low energy effective theories with eight supercharges, a crucial\nnew ingredient emerges due to the presence of non-trivial background G-fluxes. Therefore, the central theme of this work is the interplay among the quantization conditions of\nG-fluxes, the contribution of G-fluxes to the tadpole cancellation condition and the flat\ndirections of the flux-induced scalar potential in the effective three-dimensional description.\nTo model the conifold transitions of interest, we first analyze non-compact local\nCalabi-Yau fourfolds with a genus g curve of conifold singularities. Geometrically, we\nfind three phases \u2013 two small resolutions and one deformation \u2013 that smooth the singular\nfourfold geometry.40 By including the M-theory G-flux we find a rich structure of consistent flux configurations governing the dynamics along such a conifold transition. The\nflux configurations at the boundary constrains and determines the dynamics in the interior. We argue that finding the flat directions of the flux-induced superpotential in the\nM-theory description is mapped to the classical problem of studying global holomorphic\nsections of divisors on Riemann surfaces: Namely, the canonical line bundle of the genus\ng curve factorizes into the two line bundles E\u00b1 as determined by the background G-flux\ndata. The global holomorphic sections of the factors E\u00b1 then give rise to flat directions of\nthe flux-induced superpotential. We illustrate our findings for particular curves of genus\ng (mainly for hyperelliptic curves), but as our result holds more generally, it would be\ninteresting to apply our techniques so as to study linear systems of line bundles on generic\nRiemann surfaces.\nThe geometrically derived factorization condition enjoys a beautiful interpretation\nin the associated three-dimensional U (1) gauge theory. The M-theory phase structure\nmatches with the phase structure of such gauge theories, i.e., the two resolved phases\ncorrespond to the two Coulomb branches whereas the deformed phase maps to a Higgs\nbranch. Moreover, the global sections of the factored bundles E\u00b1 are in one-to-one correspondence with the \u00b11 charged chiral spectrum of the U (1) gauge theory. The products\n40\n\nNote the interesting distinction from the familiar case of type II string theories on a Calabi\u2013\n\nYau threefold: in that case, the two small resolutions unify into a single branch of the moduli\nspace [32].\n\n66\n\n\fof such sections \u2013 realizing the flat directions of M-theory in the deformed phase \u2013 correspond in the field theory to gauge invariant mesonic condensates, which parametrize the\nHiggs branch of the three-dimensional U (1) gauge theory. Moreover, in the two Coulomb\nbranches these charged multiplets become massive, they are integrated out and generate\n(for a non-vanishing index of the chiral spectrum) a Chern-Simons coupling at one loop.\nWe demonstrate that the characteristic structure of such one-loop Chern-Simons terms is\nreproduced by the M-theory phases attributed to the two small resolutions.\nAt the transition point itself, the structure of the global symmetries together with\ntheir anomaly structure of the U (1) gauge theory signal the emergence of new degrees of\nfreedom giving evidence for a non-trivially interacting three-dimensional N = 2 SCFT.\nClearly, it would be interesting to further investigate such a N = 2 SCFT at the transition\npoint. To make direct contact with the M-theory description we believe that a detailed\nanalysis of the quantum effects is necessary.\nBy embedding the local Calabi-Yau fourfold geometries into compact Calabi-Yau fourfolds, we realize conifold extremal transitions in the context of global M-theory compactification. A consistent choice of G-flux also specifies the boundary conditions of the associated\nlocal M-theory geometry. The quantization condition imposed by the global Calabi-Yau\nfourfold imposes further constraints on the possible realization of G-flux in the local Mtheory geometries. In order to realize a dynamically unobstructed conifold transition in\nthis global setting, we find a consistently quantized background G-flux of \"mixed type\".\nAs explained, these flux backgrounds of mixed type include G-flux quanta, which reside\nin both the vertical and horizontal cohomology of the Calabi-Yau fourfold. Such G-flux\nconfigurations reflect the factorization condition discovered for flat directions in the local\nCalabi-Yau fourfold transitions. In the global fourfold the factorization condition signals\nthe appearance of non-generic algebraic four-cycle supported with G-flux and extremizing\nthe flux-induced superpotential.\nThe class of local geometries for the conifold transitions studied here comprises geometries of \"matter curves\" in gauge theories from F-theory, studied in depth in refs. [17,18,19].\nThe local solutions to the quantization and flatness conditions for the G flux (potential)\nencountered in our M-theory analysis thus carry over to solutions for the 7-brane dynamics\nin F-theory compactifications, provided the 3d spectrum is anomaly free in the 4d sense\nand the normal bundle allows for an elliptic fibration. The extension to non-Abelian SU (n)\ngauge theories is demonstrated at the hand of an explicit example of a chain of topologically distinct fourfolds with An\u22121 surface singularities, connected by extremal conifold\n67\n\n\ftransitions along curves of varying genera. We discuss consistency of G-fluxes for the individual fourfolds in the transition chain, but we do not examine the implications of the\nflux-induced potentials at the level of the underlying non-Abelian phase structure, and we\nhope to return to this analysis elsewhere.\nThe M-theory analysis again parallels the F-theory discussion in [17,18] and we hope\nthe results on the M-theory classification of consistent fluxes and the flat directions of their\npotential also prove useful in the context of F-theory in the future.\nA somewhat curious observation that deserves further study is the relation between\nthree different objects, namely the phase transitions in (possibly interacting superconformal) 3d field theory on one hand, the fluxes for the associated extremal fourfold transition consistent with the local quantization condition on the other hand, and finally\nthe close connection of these fluxes to 2d Kazama-Suzuki models based on the group\nG = SU (M )/(SU (M \u2212 l) \u00d7 SU (l) \u00d7 U (1)) described in refs. [15,35]. In the present context, M = 2g \u2212 2 was related to the genus g of the curve C of conifold singularities and the\ninteger l = ||k \u266f | \u2212 (g \u2212 1)| is related to the index k \u266f of the 3d field theory. This connection\nmight be interesting from the point of a possible group theoretical classification of the\ncomponents of the vacuum space as well as for a better understanding of the field theory\nspectrum at the 3d conformal fixed points.\n\nAcknowledgements:\nWe would like to thank Mina Aganagic, Murad Alim, Andr\u00e9s Collinucci, Thomas Grimm,\nSergei Gukov, Jonathan Heckman, Christoph Mayrhofer, Sakura Sch\u00e4fer-Nameki, and\nTimo Weigand for useful discussions and correspondence.

Calabi\u2013Yau fourfolds and collection of (co)homology data\nIn this appendix we collect some information on the cohomology groups of the global and\nlocal fourfolds used in the text.\nHodge numbers\nA compact Calabi\u2013Yau fourfold X has Hodge numbers hp,q satisfying the usual Hodge\nsymmetry hq,p = hp,q , Poincar\u00e9 duality hn\u2212p,n\u2212q = hp,q and the Calabi\u2013Yau condition\nh0,0 = h4,0 = 1, h1,0 = h2,0 = h3,0 = 0. This apparently leaves four independent Hodge\nnumbers h1,1 , h2,1 , h3,1 , and h2,2 , but as shown in [28] they are not independent:\n\u2212h1,1 + h2,1 \u2212 h3,1 = 8 \u2212\n\u22122h2,1 + h2,2 = 12 +\n\n\u03c7\n6\n\n2\u03c7\n3\n\n(where \u03c7 is the Euler characteristic of X), from which it follows that\nh2,2 = 44 + 4h1,1 \u2212 2h2,1 + 4h3,1 .\nThe K\u00e4hler form J of the Calabi\u2013Yau fourfold also determines a Lefschetz decomposition of the cohomology. The second cohomology has a one-dimensional imprimitive\npart spanned by [J] and the orthogonal complement (J 3 )\u22a5 \u2282 H 2 (X) is the primitive part\n2\nHprim\n(X). The fourth cohomology has two imprimitive parts: one spanned by [J 2 ] and\n2\nthe other of the form J \u2227 Hprim\n(X).\n\nHomology four-cycles and H 4 (X, Z): global case\nFor a compact Calabi\u2013Yau fourfold X, Poincar\u00e9 duality asserts that if Ei is a basis of fourcycles for H4 (X, Z), then there exists another basis of four-cycles Ei\u2217 such that Ei \u2229 Ej\u2217 =\n\u03b4ij . Thus H 4 (X, Z) \u2243 H4 (X, Z) is an unimodular lattice of rank b4 = 2 + 2h1,3 + h2,2 . The\nsignature of the lattice is the pair (n+ , n\u2212 ), with the (anti-)self-dual forms contributing\nto the positive (negative) part of dimension n+ (n\u2212 ). From the Hodge index theorem\n(working over C), the forms of type (4,0) and (0,4) and primitive (2,2)-forms contribute to\nn+ , forms of type (3,1) and (1,3) to n\u2212 . Of the imprimitive (2,2) forms, those coming from\n1,1\nJ \u2227 Hprim\n(a space of dimension h1,1 \u2212 1) contribute to n\u2212 while the form J 2 contributes\n\n1 to n+ . Putting these together, we find\n(n+ , n\u2212 ) = (2 + h2,2 \u2212 (h1,1 \u2212 1), 2h3,1 + (h1,1 \u2212 1)).\n69\n\n\fOn the other hand, from the Hirzebruch signature theorem it follows that [15]\n\u03c3 = n+ \u2212 n\u2212 = 8(\n\n\u03c7\n+ 4),\n24\n\n(A.1)\n\nwhich also follows from the relations above:\nn+ \u2212 n\u2212 = 4 + h2,2 \u2212 2h1,1 \u2212 2h3,1 = 48 + 2h1,1 \u2212 2h2,1 + 2h3,1 = 32 +\n\n\u03c7\n.\n3\n\nIf c2 (X) is even, H 4 (X, Z) is even [16], and the lattice \u0393n+ ,n\u2212 \u2243 H 4 (X, Z) is unique\nup to isometry [71], with inner product\n(e\u2217i , e\u2217j )\n\n\u2243 H\n\n\u2295\n\nb4 \u2212\u03c3\n2\n\n\u2295\n\n\u2295\u03c3\nE8 8\n\n,\n\nH=\n\n\u0012\n\n0\n1\n\n1\n0\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(A.2)\n\nHere E8 denotes the Cartan matrix of E8 and we write the formula for \u03c3 > 0, with the\nobvious changes for \u03c3 < 0. If c2 (X) is odd, then H 4 (X, Z) is odd [16] and the lattice is\nagain unique up to isometry [71], this time taking the form\n(e\u2217i , e\u2217j ) \u2243 (1)\u2295n+ \u2295 (\u22121)\u2295n\u2212 .\n\n(A.3)\n\nVertical and horizontal cohomology\nSlightly modifying the construction in [72,73,30], we decompose the even cohomology of X\ninto \"vertical\" and \"horizontal\" parts. The vertical cohomology is the subring of H \u2217 (X, Z)\ngenerated by H 2 (X, Z). That is, the vertical cohomology consists of all linear combinations\nof expressions Ji1 \u2227 * * * \u2227 Jik for integral K\u00e4hler classes Ji\u03b1 . These classes are always of\ntype (k, k), no matter what complex structure is chosen on X, and can be thought of as\n\"complete intersections\" of divisors on X.\nOn the other hand, the horizontal cohomology is the subset of H 4 (X, Z) which is\northogonal to Ji \u2227 Jj for every pair of K\u00e4hler classes Ji and Jj . These classes are always\nprimitive, no matter what K\u00e4hler structure is chosen on X.\nFinding appropriate supersymmetric four-cycles to represent a given integral cycle\nclass is a challenging problem. When the class has type (2,2), the celebrated Hodge\nconjecture asserts that there should be an algebraic cycle representing the class (which\nwould provide a supersymmetric cycle). A class which is not in the vertical cohomology\ncan only be of type (2,2) for a proper subset of the complex structures on X.\nOn the other hand, when the class is primitive, it has all of the cohomological properties one expects of a special Lagrangian cycle (although unfortunately we have no general\n70\n\n\fexistence results which would guarantee that it is a special Lagrangian cycle. A special\nLagrangian representative would be supersymmetric. Note that a class which is not in the\nhorizontal cohomology can only satisfy this primitivity assumption (the \"cohomological\nspecial Lagrangian\" assumption) for a proper subset of the K\u00e4hler structures on X.\nThere is a third possibility for a supersymmetric representative, described in [30]:\nthere could be a representative for the cohomology class which is a Cayley cycle, which\nwould give a 1/4-BPS cycle.\nNote that the intersection form restricted to the horizontal cohomology will not in\ngeneral be unimodular. Thus, the decomposition of H 4 (X, Z) into vertical and horizontal\npieces cannot in general be done over the integers: one needs rational coefficients. We refer\nto a four-cycle with components in both spaces as a mixed four-cycle.\nMoreover, although a basis of integral cycles for these vertical/horizontal subspaces\ncan be determined by fourfold mirror symmetry as described in [68,74], these will not\ngenerate H 4 (X, Z), which is the relevant group for the (appropriately shifted) G-flux.\nAs a simple example consider the sextic X in P5 with h1,1 (X) = 1 generated by the\nR\nhyperplane H with X H 4 = 6. The generator of non-primitive four-forms in HV2,2 (X)\nR\nis the dual of an irreducible sextic in P3 of class H 2 with X (H 2 )2 = 6. The primitive\npart is expected to be generated (over the rationals) by duals of special Lagrangian cycles.\n\nThe basis of algebraic and special Lagrangian cycles generates a finite index sublattice of\nH4 (X, Z). A basis of H 4 (X, Z) necessarily includes a mixed class of the form e = 61 H 2 + \u03b8,\nwith \u03b8 a rational multiple of a form dual to a special Lagrangian cycle, possibly dual to a\nCayley cycle.\nMirror symmetry and the Hodge conjecture\nWe have identified certain cycles \u2013 the integral (p, p) cycles \u2013 as being suitable for fluxes that\nminimize the superpotential, and other cycles \u2013 the integral primitive cycles \u2013 as being\nsuitable for fluxes that minimize the twisted superpotential. Mirror symmetry between\npairs of Calabi\u2013Yau fourfolds should exchange several things: the horizontal and vertical\ncohomologies should be exchanged, the integral (p, p) cycles (which may include more\ncycles than just the vertical cohomology) should be exchanged with the integral primitive\ncycles (which may include more cycles than just the horizontal cohomology).\nTo get supersymmetric representatives of cycles, calibrated cycles should be used, and\nthe two natural calibrations for Calabi\u2013Yau fourfolds \u2013 the K\u00e4hler calibration and the\n71\n\n\fspecial Lagrangain calibration \u2013 should also be exchanged under mirror symmetry (since\nthey lead to different types of branes). Since the Hodge conjecture can be interpreted as\nasserting that any integral (p, p) cycles is, up to torsion, a rational linear combination of\nK\u00e4hler-calibrated cycles (i.e., algebraic cycles), it is tempting to formulate the following:\nMirror Hodge Conjecture. If G is a middle-dimensional cycle on a compact Calabi\u2013\nYau manifold such that [G] \u2227 J is an exact form, then, up to torsion, G is a rational linear\ncombination of special Lagrangian cycles.\nAlthough not as well motivated by mirror symmetry, one can go on to formulate the:\nSymplectic Hodge Conjecture. If G is a middle-dimensional cycle on a compact symplectic manifold such that [G] \u2227 \u03c9 is an exact form (where \u03c9 is the symplectic form), then,\nup to torsion, G is a rational linear combination of Lagrangian cycles.\nCohomology groups of local fourfolds\ne of the local fourfolds X\ne \u266f and X\ne \u266d is\nAs described in the text, the common boundary \u2202 X\ne Z) can\na S 3 bundle with base S \u266f .

In the following we collectively\nfr .\ndenote the geometry of these three phases by X\n\nIn addition to their U (1) charges the fields s1 to s4 transform as sections of line bundles\nfr is realized as the non-trivial\nS1 to S4 over the curve C, and therefore the local fourfold X\n\nfibration\n\n/X\nfr .\n\nV //U (1)\n\n(B.2)\n\n\u03c0\n\n\u000f\nC\n\nThe coordinates x1 to x4 in eq.

Note, however, that the line bundle P cancels\nout in the symplectic quotient V //U (1).\n\n74\n\n\fFurthermore, we define the divisor class Dl = {sl = 0} and Dp = \u03c0 \u22121 (p) in terms of a\npoint p on the curve C. Note that these divisor classes do not depend on the parameter r\nfr is a normal variety for all values of r (as the conifold singularities\nbecause the fourfold X\nfr for r = 0 at codimension two). As a consequence, we can also define the\narise in X\nfr ) (because H 2,0 (X\nfr ) = 0) in a r-independent way by means\ncohomology elements H 2 (X\nof Poincar\u00e9 duality. Thus, we define the (1, 1)-forms \u03c9l and \u03c9p as duals of the divisors Dl\nand Dp .\n\nLet us first concentrate on the phase r > 0. The surface S1\u266f intersects Dp at a generic\nP1 -fiber F1 , i.e.,\nF1 = S1\u266f .Dp .\n\n(B.6)\n\nThe generic fiber F1 yields according to ref. [34] the intersection numbers\nF1 .D1/2 = S1\u266f .Dp .D1/2 = 1 ,\n\nF1 .D3/4 = S1\u266f .Dp .D3/4 = \u22121 ,\n\nF1 .Dp = S1\u266f .Dp .Dp = 0 .\n(B.7)\n\nThe vanishing intersection is a consequence of the fact that two generic fibers F1 are nonintersecting. Furthermore, S1\u266f intersects the divisors D1/2 in the two sections C1\u2032 and C1 ,\ni.e.,\nC1 = S1\u266f .D2 ,\n\nC1\u2032 = S1\u266f .D1 ,\n\n(B.8)\n\nand we arrive at their intersections\nC1 .Dp = 1 ,\n\nC1 .D1 = 0 ,\n\nC1 .D2 = deg L4 \u2212 deg L1 = \u2212n ,\n\nC1\u2032 .Dp = 1 ,\n\nC1\u2032 .D2 = 0 ,\n\nC1\u2032 .D1 = deg L1 \u2212 deg L4 = n ,\n\n(B.9)\n\nand the self-intersection\nS1\u266f .S1\u266f = 2 \u2212 2g .\n\n(B.10)\n\nThe vanishing intersections are a consequence of the fact that the two sections C1 and C1\u2032\nare disjoint in S1\u266f . The intersections C1 .D2 = S1\u266f .D2 .D2 and C1\u2032 .D1 = S1\u266f .D1 .D1 and the\nself-intersection of S1\u266f are calculated by using eqs. (B.4) and the fact that \u2013 on the level of\nthe performed intersection calculus \u2013 we have the relations D1 +D3 \u223c (deg S1 +deg S3 )Dp ,\nD2 + D3 \u223c (deg S2 + deg S3 )Dp and so on. By inspecting the resulting intersection numbers (B.7) and (B.9), we readily identify the curves C1 and F1 with the curves C and F (and\nC1\u2032 with C \u2032 ) of eq. (3.5). The K\u00e4hler form is again given by J(S1\u266f ) = J1F (\u03c92 + n \u03c9p ) + J1C \u03c9p\n(c.f., eq. (3.9)), and, as before, we find the K\u00e4hler volume\nZ\nn\n1\nJ(S1\u266f ) \u2227 J(S1\u266f ) = (J1F )2 + J1F J1C ,\n2 S1\u266f\n2\n75\n\n(B.11)\n\n\fwhere J1F and J1C measure the volumes of the curves F1 and C1 .\nWe now turn to the phase r < 0. In particular, we are interested how the volume\nintegral (B.11) behaves as we traverse from the r > 0 phase to the r < 0 phase. The divisors\nand their dual (1, 1)-forms remain invariant, but we need to recalculate the intersection\nnumbers. Using similar arguments as for the intersection numbers in the phase r > 0, we\nfind for r < 0\nS2\u266f .Dp .D1/2 = \u22121 ,\n\nS2\u266f .Dp .D3/4 = 1 ,\n\nS2\u266f .D3 .D4 = 0 ,\n\nS2\u266f .D2 .D2 = n \u2212 (2g \u2212 2) ,\n(B.12)\n\nand\nS2\u266f .S2\u266f = 2 \u2212 2g .\n\n(B.13)\n\nWith these intersection numbers we immediately infer the volume integral (3.14) of the\nsurface S2\u266f expressed in terms of the K\u00e4hler coordinates J1F and J1C .\n\nAppendix C. The quarternionic Hopf fibration and the Milnor fibration\nf\u266d , we must\nIn order to control the intersection properties of the four-cycles Bl\u266d on X\n\ntake some care in how they are defined. Our main tools are the Milnor fibration [75] and\nthe quaternionic Hopf fibration.\n\nLocally near a zero of \u01eb, we can use \u01eb as a local coordinate on the curve C, and regard\nf\u266d \u2192 C. The fiber of the map over 0 has a singular point,\n\u01eb as locally describing the map X\nf\u266d with respect to\nand locally near that singular point, there are four coordinates x on X\nl\n\nwhich the function \u01eb takes the form\n\n\u01eb = x1 x2 \u2212 x3 x4 .\nWe will use these coordinates to describe the fourfold near such a zero, which is isomorphic\nto a neighborhood of the origin in C4 .\nThe function \u01eb = \u01eb(xl ) : C4 \u2192 C defines an isolated hypersurface singularity, and\nMilnor found a very elegant way to describe the topology near such a singularity. Let\nSr7 = {kx1 k2 + kx2 k2 + kx3 k2 + kx4 k2 = r 2 } be the sphere of radius r in C4 . The Milnor\nfibration is the map\n\u01eb\nk\u01ebk\n\n: Sr7 \u2212 (Sr7 \u2229 {\u01eb = 0}) \u2192 S 1 ,\nSr7 \u2212(Sr7 \u2229{\u01eb=0})\n\n76\n\n\fand its fibers, the Milnor fibers, are in general homotopic to a wedge of 3-spheres. In\nour case, the function \u01eb describes the simplest isolated hypersurface singularity, and the\nMilnor fiber is diffeomorphic to T \u2217 S 3 , the cotangent bundle of the 3-sphere. A 3-sphere\nin the Milnor fiber is a vanishing cycle, since there is a four-chain whose boundary is the\n3-sphere, given by taking the cone over S 3 \u2282 Sr7 to get a bounding four-chain \u03a34 \u2282 B8r ,\nwhere B8r is the 8-ball of radius r.\nAs we will show momentarily, a generating 3-sphere in the Milnor fiber can be deformed to a 3-sphere contained in the fiber of the map \u01eb. Our strategy for giving an explicit\ndescription of the four-cycles Bl\u266d is as follows. We have a path joining p0 to pl on C. In\nf\u266d \u2192 C. Near\nthe middle of this path, we follow a 3-sphere within the fiber of the map X\n\neach endpoint, though, we stop following the path, and follow instead the deformation of\nthe 3-sphere in the fiber of \u01eb to a 3-sphere in the Milnor fiber of small radius, concluding\nby using the bounding four-chain \u03a34 to close off the four-cycle.\nIn order to describe the behavior explicitly near the origin, we use the quaternionic\n\nHopf fibration. Let us introduce quaternion variables q1 = x1 + x4 j and q2 = x3 + x2 j\nwhich allow us to regard C4 as H2 . Note that the quaternionic conjugate q1 = x\u03041 \u2212 x4 j\nsatisfies q1 q1 = kq1 k2 = kx1 k2 + kx4 k2 .\nThere is a natural map H2 \u2192 HP1 \u223c\n= S 4 defined by (q1 , q2 ) 7\u2192 [q1 , q2 ]. If q1 6= 0 then\nq2\nq2 q1\n(x3 + x2 j)(x\u03041 \u2212 x4 j)\n] = [1,\n] = [1,\n]\n2\nq1\nkq1 k\nkx1 k2 + kx4 k2\n(x\u03041 x3 + x2 x\u03044 ) + (x1 x2 \u2212 x3 x4 )j\n= [1,\n].\nkx1 k2 + kx4 k2\n\n[q1 , q2 ] = [1,\n\nIf we restrict this map to the sphere Sr7 \u2282 H2 of radius r, we get the quaternionic Hopf\nfibration S 7 \u2192 S 4 whose fibers are 3-spheres. More explicitly, if we fix \u03c3 + \u03c4 j \u2208 H \u2282 S 4 ,\nthen the quaternionic Hopf fiber over \u03c3 + \u03c4 j defined by\nx\u03041 x3 + x2 x\u03044\n= \u03c3,\nkx1 k2 + kx4 k2\n\nx1 x2 \u2212 x3 x4\n= \u03c4 ,\nkx1 k2 + kx4 k2\n\nkx1 k2 + kx2 k2 + kx3 k2 + kx4 k2 = r 2\n\nis a three-sphere.\nWe have chosen our coordinates very carefully, to insure that \u03c4 /k\u03c4 k = \u01eb/k\u01ebk. Thus,\nthe three-spheres in the quaternionic Hopf fibration are contained in the Milnor fibers for\nthe function \u01eb = x1 x2 \u2212 x3 x4 . (Note that the complex variable \u03c3 labels a real 2-parameter\n77\n\n\ffamily of such 3-spheres within a fixed Milnor fiber labeled by \u03c4 . We denote that 3sphere by S\u03c33 if we need to emphasize this dependence on parameters.) The advantage\nof this description is that we can immediately see that the bounding four-chains \u03a34 are\nquaternion-linear subspaces of H2 , and so are nonsingular four-manifolds with boundary.\nMoreover, any two such bounding four-chains meet transversally in a single point, with\nintersection number +1 (using the natural orientation of the quaternions). This reflects a\nwell-known property of the quaternionic Hopf fibration, analogous to the same property\nof the ordinary Hopf fibration: any two fibers Sj3 \u2282 S 7 (j = 1, 2) of the quaternionic Hopf\nfibration have linking number 1 in the 7-sphere.\nTo finish our story, we must show that the Hopf fiber S\u03c33 in the Milnor fiber over\n\u03c4 /k\u03c4 k can be naturally deformed to a 3-sphere in the fiber \u01eb\u22121 (\u03c4 ) of the holomorphic map\n\u01eb. Assume that \u03c3 6= 0, which imples that x1 and x4 do not simultaneously vanish on S\u03c33 .\nWe rescale, defining\n\nxl\n,\nx\nbl = p\nkx1 k2 + kx4 k2\n\nl = 1, 2, 3, 4 .\n\nThe defining equations for the fiber of the Hopf fibration become\nx\nb\u03041 x\nb3 + x\nb2 x\nb\u03044 = \u03c3 ,\n\nx\nb1 x\nb2 \u2212 x\nb3 x\nb4 = \u03c4 ,\n\nkb\nx1 k2 + kb\nx4 k 2 = 1 .\n\nc3 is contained in \u01eb\u22121 (\u03c4 ). (Note that kb\nThat is, the rescaled 3-sphere S\nx1 k2 + kb\nx2 k 2 +\n\u03c3\nkb\nx3 k2 + kb\nx4 k2 = r 2 (kx1 k2 + kx4 k2 ) does not constrain the variables, but rather, allows the\ndefinition\n\nkx1 k2 + kx4 k2 =\n\nkb\nx1 k2 + kb\nx2 k2 + kb\nx3 k2 + kb\nx4 k 2\n,\nr2\n\nwhich can be used to construct the inverse transformation.)\nLet us now consider the intersection number of two such cycles Bl\u266d .Bl\u266d\u2032 . Near each\npoint pj , the bundle of 3-spheres in fibers is an oriented bundle, so we can fix a consistent\norientation of the 3-spheres throughout a neighborhood of pj . We can also fix a common\norientation for all paths emanating from pj , either pointing towards the point or pointing\naway from the point. Note that changing the orientation of all of the 3-spheres changes\nthe orientations of both Bl\u266d and Bl\u266d\u2032 , and thus does not change the intersection number.\nSimilarly, changing the orientation of all of the paths emanating from pj does not change\nthe intersection number.\nWe computed a local contribution to the intersection number at a point pj by using\nthe natural orientation of the quaternions. Given a choice of how to orienting paths\n78\n\n\femanating from pj , the quaternion orientation determines an orientation of all of the 3spheres. Whichever orientation it is, it is the same orientation for both four-cycles, so the\nlocal contribution of + 1 to the intersection number is correct.\nGlobally, if l 6= l\u2032 then Bl\u266d and Bl\u266d\u2032 are given by paths from p0 to pl and pl\u2032 , respectively.\nIf we choose the tangent directions of those two paths at p0 to be different, then we can\nuse the computation above to conclude that the intersection number is 1.\nOn the other hand, if l = l\u2032 , we can choose two different paths from p0 to pl , and\nwe can take them to have differnt tangent directions at p0 and also at pl . Thus, at each\nendpoint we get a contribution of 1, for a total intersection number of 2.\n\nAppendix D. The Clemens-Schmid exact sequence\nD.1. Triple-point-free Clemens-Schmid exact sequences\nThe original sources for the Clemens\u2013Schmid exact sequence are refs. [76,77]; we follow\nthe exposition in ref. [78], which is based in part on refs. [79,80,81].\nA semistable degeneration is a K\u00e4hler manifold X of dimension d + 1 together with\na map X \u2192 \u2206 to the unit disk such that the fibers Xt := \u03c0 \u22121 (t) for t 6= 0 are compact\nS\ncomplex manifolds of dimension d and X0 = Xi is reduced divisor with each Xi a compact\ncomplex manifold of dimension d, such that all intersections of distinct components Xi1 ,\n\n. . . , Xik are transverse. (\"Reduced\" means that the function t has a simple zero along\neach Xi .)\nWe will consider a special case of this, in which Xi meets Xj transversally for i 6= j,\nbut all triple intersections Xi \u2229 Xj \u2229 Xk (i, j, k distinct) are empty. In this case, we call\nthe degeneration triple-point-free following refs. [82,83].\nFor a triple-point-free degeneration, define X [0] to be the disjoint union of the components Xi , and X [1] to be the disjoint union of the intersections Xij := Xi \u2229 Xj . There\nare restriction maps\nH m (X [0] ) \u2212\u2192 H m (X [1] ) ,\nand we define\n\nE20,m := Ker(H m (X [0] ) \u2212\u2192 H m (X [1] )) ,\nE21,m := Coker(H m (X [0] ) \u2212\u2192 H m (X [1] )) .\n79\n\n(D.1)\n\n\fAs the notation suggests, these are the E2 terms in a spectral sequence, which degenerates\nat E2 and converges to the cohomology of X0 . In practice, this means that there are short\nexact sequences\n0 \u2212\u2192 E21,m\u22121 \u2212\u2192 H m (X0 ) \u2212\u2192 E20,m \u2212\u2192 0 .\n\n(D.2)\n\nFor brevity, we denote H m (X0 ) by H m . It turns out that this is also isomorphic to\nthe cohomology of the total space H m (X ). (For general semistable degenerations, the\nconstruction involves more strata X [k] , and is much more complicated.)\nThese cohomology groups carry mixed Hodge structures. This means that there is a\n\"weight\" filtration on cohomology whose graded pieces carry Hodge structures of the given\nweight.42 In the triple-point-free case, the weight filtration has only two non-trivial terms:\nWm\u22121 H m = E21,m\u22121 , and Wm H m = H m (with Wm\u22122 H m = {0}); the corresponding\nW\nW\ngraded pieces Grm\u22121\nH m := Wm\u22121 H m and Grm\nH m := Wm H m /Wm\u22121 H m carry Hodge\n\nstructures of weights m \u2212 1 and m, respectively.\nThere is an induced filtration, with induced Hodge structures of negative weight, on\nthe homology Hm . The weights of the Hodge structures are \u2212m and \u2212m + 1.\nOn the other hand, the cohomology of the general fibers H m (Xt ) admit a monodromy\ntransformation T with a logarithm N , and the limit as t \u2192 0 of the Hodge structures on\nm\n. The monH m (Xt ) gives another mixed Hodge structure. Let us denote this limit by Hlim\n\nodromy weight filtration is in general a somewhat complicated linear algebra construction\nusing N , but in the case that N 2 = 0 (which corresponds to our triple-point-free situation)\nit takes a simple form:\nm\nWm\u22121 Hlim\n= Im(N ) ,\n\nm\nWm Hlim\n= Ker(N ) ,\n\nm\nm\nWm+1 Hlim\n= Hlim\n.\n\n(D.3)\n\nSo there is a Hodge structure of weight m \u2212 1 on Im(N ), a Hodge structure of weight m\nm\non Ker(N )/Im(N ) and a Hodge structure of weight m + 1 on Hlim\n/Ker(N ).\n\nThe Clemens\u2013Schmid exact sequence is an exact sequence of mixed Hodge structures:\n\u03b1\n\ni\u2217\n\n\u03b2\n\nN\n\n\u03b1\n\nm\nm\n\u2212\u2192H2n\u2212m \u2212\u2192H m+2 \u2212\u2192 * * * .\n\u2212\u2192Hlim\n* * * \u2212\u2192 H2n\u2212m+2 \u2212\u2192H m \u2212\u2192Hlim\n42\n\nA Hodge structure of weight k on a vector space V is a decomposition V \u2297 C \u223c\n=\n\nwith V q,p = V p,q .\n\n80\n\nL\n\n(D.4)\np+q=k\n\nV p,q\n\n\fLet us describe the various maps in this sequence.

Conifold transition in Calabi\u2013Yau threefolds\nThe Clemens\u2013Schmid exact sequence can be used to study three-dimensional conifold\ntransitions [53,2] in the general geometric setting of refs. [84,85,86,87]. This has previously\nbeen worked out in ref. [88]; we review it here to establish notation and familiarity with\nour setup.\nWe take a family Xe of Calabi\u2013Yau threefolds Xs depending on s \u2208 \u2206 which acquires\n\n\u03b4 nodes at s = 0. Our key assumption is that the \u03b4 vanishing cycles for these nodes\n\nonly span a subspace of dimension \u03c3 := \u03b4 \u2212 \u03c1 within H 3 (Xs ). Since the vanishing cycles\n3\n3\nspan the image of N on Hlim\n, this implies that W2 Hlim\n= Im(N ) has rank \u03c3, and so that\n3\nGr2W H 3 \u223c\nalso has rank \u03c3.\n= Gr2W Hlim\n\nTo obtain a semistable degeneration, we would like to blowup the nodes, but a simple\ncomputation shows that the resulting central fiber would not be reduced (i.e., the function\ns would have a double zero along the exceptional divisor). The way forward is pointed to\nby Mumford's semistable reduction theorem [89], and we make the \"basechange\" s = t2\nbefore blowing up the nodes.\nIt is worth making the local computation to see what is going on. We have\nx 1 x 2 \u2212 x 3 x 4 = t2 ,\nand we are blowing up the origin in that space. At t = 0 we see two (local) components:\none of them, X, is the blowup of the original fiber Xe0 at the node. Note that this is\n\nthe not the familiar small blowup which replaces the node by a P1 but rather a bigger\n\nblowup which replaces it by a quadric surface P1 \u00d7 P1 . The other local component Y is\nthe exceptional divisor of the blowup, isomorphic to a nonsingular quadric hypersurface in\nP4 . Note that X \u2229 Y = E \u223c\n= P1 \u00d7 P1 .\nMore globally, we will have X and \u03b4 exceptional divisors Y1 , . . . , Y\u03b4 , one for each node,\nS\nwith X0 = X \u222a Yi . X is the blowup of X \u266f along the rational curves Si\u266f with exceptional\n\ndivisors Ei \u2282 X, and Xt coincides with X \u266d .\n\nTo compute the cohomology of X0 and its weight filtration, we must study the maps\nH m (X [0] ) \u2192 H m (X [1] ), which in this case can be written as\nH m (X \u266f ) \u2295 Blm \u2295\n\nM\n\nH m (Yi ) \u2212\u2192\n82\n\nM\n\nH m (Ei ) ,\n\n\fwhere Blm represents the addition to the cohomology of X \u266f caused by the blowup. ExL\nL\nZ[Ei ] and Bl4 =\nZ[ei ].\nplicitly, if ei \u2282 Ei is the fiber of Ei \u2192 Si\u266f , then Bl2 =\n\nIn the cases m = 1 and m = 5, all of the constituents of the cohomology vanish, so we\n\nconclude that W1 H 1 , W1 H 2 , W5 H 5 , and W5 H 6 all vanish. In the case m = 3, the only\nnonvanishing constitutent is H 3 (X \u266f ), so W3 H 3 = H 3 (X \u266f ) and W3 H 4 vanishes.\nIn the case m = 0, the maps H 0 (Yi ) \u2192 H 0 (Ei ) are isomorphisms, so the kernel is\njust W0 H 0 = H 0 (X \u266f ) and the cokernel W0 H 1 vanishes. In the case m = 6, the right side\nL 6\nvanishes and we simply get W6 H 6 = H 6 (X \u266f ) \u2295\nH (Yi ) = Z\u03b4+1 .\nIn the case m = 4, since Gr4W H 5 vanishes, the map\nH 4 (X \u266f ) \u2295\n\nM\n\nZ[ei ] \u2295\n\nM\n\nH 4 (Yi ) \u2212\u2192\n\nM\n\nH 4 (Ei )\n\nis surjective, and its kernel must be W4 H 4 = H 4 (X \u266f ) \u2295 Z\u03b4 .\n\nFinally, in the case m = 2, since Gr2W H 3 has rank \u03c3 and it is the cokernel of the map\nH 2 (X \u266f ) \u2295\n\nM\n\nZ[Ei ] \u2295\n\nM\n\nH 2 (Yi ) \u2212\u2192\n\nthe kernel of that map is W2 H 2 = H 2 (X \u266f ) \u2295 Z\u03c3 .\n\nM\n\nH 2 (Ei ) ,\n\nNow we can use the Clemens\u2013Schmid exact sequence to relate the cohomology and\nHodge structures of X \u266f and X \u266d . We focus on the \"interesting\" part of the sequence. If\nm = 4, this reads\n2\nW\n4\n0 \u2212\u2192 Gr2W Hlim\n\u2212\u2192 Gr\u22124\nH4 \u2212\u2192 Gr4W H 4 \u2212\u2192 Gr4W Hlim\n\u2212\u2192 0 .\n\nNote that there is no monodromy here, so the first and last terms coincide with H 2 (X \u266d )\nand H 4 (X \u266d ), respectively. Since the middle two groups have the same rank, the kernel\nand cokernel must also have the same rank. This simply expresses Poincar\u00e9 duality for\nH \u2217 (X \u266d ), and we learn nothing new.\nIf m = 3, our sequence reads\n1\nW\n3\n0 \u2212\u2192 Gr1W Hlim\n\u2212\u2192 Gr\u22125\nH5 \u2212\u2192 Gr3W H 3 \u2212\u2192 Gr3W Hlim\n\u2212\u2192 0 .\n\nThe first two terms vanish, so this gives an isomorphism between the last two terms. The\nlast term is only part of H 3 (X \u266d ), and in fact we have\n3\nH 3 (X \u266d ) = Gr3W Hlim\n\u2295 Z2\u03c3 = H 3 (X \u266f ) \u2295 Z2\u03c3 .\n\n83\n\n\fNote that at the level of Hodge structures, the limit of the Hodge structures on H 3 (Xt )\nas t \u2192 0 retains a piece of smaller rank which coincides with H 3 (X \u266f ) and has a Hodge\nstructure of weight 3, while the other part of the cohomology goes to parts of the limiting\nmixed Hodge structure of weights 2 and 4.\nFinally, if m = 2, our sequence reads\n0\nW\n2\n0 \u2212\u2192 Gr0W Hlim\n\u2212\u2192 Gr\u22126\nH6 \u2212\u2192 Gr2W H 2 \u2212\u2192 Gr2W Hlim\n\u2212\u2192 0 .\n\nThe first two terms have ranks 1 and \u03b4 + 1, respectively, and the third term is isomorphic\nto H 2 (X \u266f ) \u2295 Z\u03c3 . Thus,\n2\nH 2 (X \u266f ) = Gr2W Hlim\n\u2295 Z\u03b4\u2212\u03c3 = H 2 (X \u266d ) \u2295 Z\u03b4\u2212\u03c3 .\n\nD.3. Conifold transition along a genus g curve in global Calabi\u2013Yau fourfolds\nTo apply the Clemens\u2013Schmid exact sequence to our fourfold extremal transition\nbetween the Calabi\u2013Yau fourfolds X \u266f and X \u266d , we must first construct a semistable degeneration, which relates one to the other.\nOur deformed Calabi\u2013Yau fourfold has a local equation of the form\nx1 x2 \u2212 x3 x4 = \u01eb ,\nwhere x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , and \u01eb are sections of the bundles L1 , . . . , L4 , and KC over C,\nrespectively. We make a one-parameter deformation of this for t \u2208 \u2206 (the unit disk),\napproaching the singular Calabi\u2013Yau space at t = 0, as follows. For that purpose, we use\nthe equation\nx 1 x 2 \u2212 x 3 x 4 = t2 \u01eb ,\n\n(D.10)\n\nwhere t is the coordinate on the disk \u2206. We will resolve singularities by blowing up\nx1 = . . . = x4 = t = 0, which gives a variety that is still fibered over C. (We can treat \u01eb as\na local coordinate on C.)\nWe can in fact regard eq. (D.10) as defining the deformation more globally. When we\ndo the blowup, on the central fiber we don't get the usual \"small\" blowup X \u266f , but rather,\nthe proper transform in that blowup is a variety X which is the blowup of X \u266f along S \u266f .\nThere is also an exceptional divisor Y of this blowup map in the ambient space, and all\n84\n\n\ftogether the blown up total space gives a family X mapping to the disk via t, such that\nthe central fiber is X0 = X \u222a Y .\nTo see the structure more clearly, we blow up in the ambient space in terms of the\nlocal coordinates z0 to z4 with z0 =\n\nt\nx1 ,\n\nz1 = x1 , z2 =\n\nx2\nx1 , . . . , z4\n\n=\n\nx4\nx1 .\n\n(These local\n\ncoordinates are again appropriate sections over the curve C.) Then the equation (D.10)\nbecomes\nz2 \u2212 z3 z4 \u2212 z02 \u01eb = 0 ,\n\n(D.11)\n\nwhile the reduced form of the resulting semistable degeneration reads\nt = z0 z1 .\nThe components z0 = 0 and z1 = 0 intersect the (local) hypersurface equations (D.11)\ntransversly and gives rise to the varieties X and Y , respectively.\nIntrinsically, we can describe Y \u2013 locally given as z1 = 0 \u2013 as a quadratic hypersurface\ninside a P4 bundle over C. More precisely, the bundle is P(L1 \u2295 L2 \u2295 L3 \u2295 L4 \u2295 O) (spanned\nby x1 , . . . , x4 , and t) when \u01eb giving a coefficient in the equation. As a consequence, the\nfibers of Y \u2192 C are quadrics of rank 5 for generic points of C, dropping to rank 4 precisely\nat the 2g \u2212 2 zeros of the section \u01eb of the canonical bundle.\nWe let E = X \u2229 Y , which locally is given by z0 = z1 = 0. This is a P1 \u00d7 P1 bundle\nover C; more precisely, it is the fibration {x1 x2 \u2212 x3 x4 = 0} \u2282 P(L1 \u2295 L2 \u2295 L3 \u2295 L4 ).\nThe cohomology of the central fiber X0 is governed by the short exact sequence (D.2),\nwhich \u2013 together with the relations (D.1) for the disjoint union X [0] of X and Y ,\nW\nand for X [1] \u2261 E \u2013 results into the (non-vanishing) graded pieces Grm\u22121\nH m (X0 ) and\nW\nGrm\nH m (X0 ). The for us relevant graded cohomology groups together with their mixed\n\nHodge structures \u2013 carrying weight and Hodge filtrations \u2013 are recorded here43\nGr1W H 2 (X0 ) =\n\nM\n\nV1p,q ,\n\ndim V1p,q = (0, 0) ,\n\nV2p,q ,\n\ndim V2p,q =\n\np+q=1\n\nGr2W H 2 (X0 ) =\n\nM\n\np+q=2\n43\n\n\u0010\n\n0, h1,1\n,0\nX\u266f\n\n\u0011\n\n(D.12)\n,\n\nTo derive the mixed Hodge structure of the central fiber X0 , we need further cohomology\n\ndata of the component varieties X and Y , which we have collected in Appendix A.\n\n85\n\n\fand\nGr3W H 4 (X0 ) =\n\nM\n\nV3p,q ,\n\ndim V3p,q =\n\nV4p,q ,\n\ndim V4p,q =\n\np+q=3\n\nGr4W H 4 (X0 ) =\n\nM\n\np+q=4\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\n0, g \u2212 h\u03032,1 , g \u2212 h\u03032,1 , 0 ,\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\n2,2\n3,1\n1, h3,1\n,\nh\n+\n2g\n\u2212\n1,\nh\n,\n1\n.\n\u266f\n\u266f\n\u266f\nX\nX\nX\n\n(D.13)\n\nThese graded cohomology groups are expressed in terms of the Hodge numbers hp,q\nof the\nX\u266f\nCalabi\u2013Yau fourfold X \u266f . h\u03032,1 denotes the number of harmonic (2, 1)-forms participating\nin the extremal transition. That is to say, 0 \u2264 h\u03032,1 \u2264 g refers to the number of (2, 1)-forms\nthat are in the image of the canonical map H 2,1 (X \u266f ) \u2192 H 2,1 (S \u266f ) and therefore disappear\ntogether with the cycle S \u266f in the extremal transition to the fourfold X \u266d .\nFirst, let's see how the vanishing cycles of the family behave. The limiting mixed\nHodge structure on H 4 (Xt ) as t \u2192 0 will have Hodge structures of three weights (c.f.,\neqs. (D.3)), determined by the behavior of N , the logarithm of monodromy. The vanishing\ncycles are in Im(N ), and give a Hodge structure of weight 3, which, according to the\nClemens\u2013Schmid exact sequence (c.f., eq. (D.6)), is identified with Gr3W H 4 (X0 ) in (D.13).\nThus, there is no (3, 0) part of this Hodge structure; the (2, 1) and (1, 2) parts of dimension\n3,1\n2,2\n(g \u2212 h\u03032,1 ) contribute to Hlim\nand Hlim\n, respectively.\n\nThe cokernel of N gives a Hodge structure of weight 5. This cokernel is isomorphic to\nIm(N ) due to eq. (D.5). The non-vanishing (g \u2212 h\u03032,1 )-dimensional (3, 2) and (2, 3) parts\n2,2\n1,3\ncontribute to Hlim\nand to Hlim\n, respectively.\n4\n\u2013 corresponding to a Hodge structure of weight 4 \u2013\nThe remaining portion of Hlim\n\ngoes over to H 4 (X0 ), and we shall see how much of it matches with H 4 (X \u266f ). The Clemens\u2013\nSchmid exact sequence tells us together with (D.13) (by evaluating the cokernel (D.9) in\nthe sequence (D.8)) that the weight 4 contribution of the limiting mixed Hodge contains\n(4, 0), (3, 1), (2, 2), (1, 3) and (0, 4) pieces. The the two one-dimensional (4, 0) and (0, 4)\nparts are associated to the holomorphic (4, 0)-form and the anti-holomorphic (0, 4)-form\nof X \u266f . The h3,1\ndimensional (3, 1) and (1, 3) pieces are identified with the complex\nX\u266f\nstructure deformations of the fourfold X \u266f . Finally, the (2, 2) part is (h2,2\n+ 2g \u2212 4)X\u266f\ndimensional. Only (h2,2\n\u2212 1) of these forms are associated with (2, 2)-forms of X \u266f . The\nX\u266f\nremaining (2g \u2212 3) (2, 2)-pieces, which go over to H 4 (X0 ), are associated with the (2g \u2212 3)\nfour-forms [Bl\u266d ] and map to forms in H 4 (Y ).\n86\n\n\fThus, in summary the Hodge diamond of X \u266d expressed in terms of the Hodge numbers\n4\nof X \u266f and decomposed into the pieces of the limiting mixed Hodge structure of Hlim\nreads\n\nH p,q (X \u266d ) =\n\nM\n\np,q\nW\nGrm\nHlim\n,\n\n(D.14)\n\nm\n\nwith\n\n0\n0\n0\np,q\nW\ndim Grm\nHlim\n=\n\n0\n1\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n\ng \u2212 h\u0303\n3,1\nhX \u266f\n0\n\n2,1\n\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n1\n0\n\n0\n2,1\n2,1\nhX \u266f \u2212 h\u0303\n0\n\n0\n1,1\nhX \u266f \u2212 1\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n2,1\n2,1\nhX \u266f \u2212 h\u0303\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n\ng \u2212 h\u0303\n2,2\nhX \u266f +2g \u2212 4\n2,1\ng \u2212 h\u0303\n\n0\n3,1\nhX \u266f\n2,1\ng \u2212 h\u0303\n\n0\n1,1\nhX \u266f \u2212 1\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n2,1\n2,1\nhX \u266f \u2212 h\u0303\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n\n2,1\n\n0\n1\n0\n\n0\n2,1\n2,1\nhX \u266f \u2212 h\u0303\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n1\n0\n\n.\n\n(D.15)\n\nThe triplet at a position (p, q) in the Hodge diamond corresponds to the three weights\nW\n\nwith respect to the limiting monodromy weight filtration, i.e.,\n\np,q\n\ndim Grp+q\u22121 Hlim\np,q\nW\ndim Grp+q Hlim\nW\np,q\ndim Grp+q+1 Hlim\n\n.
