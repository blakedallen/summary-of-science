Typical luminosity distribution [2,3] in \u03b3\u03b3 collisions\nhas a high energy peak and some low energy part. The peak has the width at half\nof maximum about 15%, photons here can have high degree of circular polarization.\nThis region is the most valuable for experimentation. Comparing event rates in \u03b3\u03b3\nand e+ e\u2212 collisions we will use the value of \u03b3\u03b3 luminosity in this peak.\nIn this talk I briefly discuss physics, possible parameters of the photon collider at\nTESLA and a lasers\u2013optics scheme.

However, reactions are different and can give complementary\ninformation. Some phenomena can best be studied at photon colliders due to better\naccuracy (larger cross-sections) or larger accessible masses (a single resonance (in\n\u03b3\u03b3 and \u03b3e) or a pair of light and heavy particles (in \u03b3e).

In \u03b3\u03b3 collisions these effects are absent, therefore\none can use beams with much smaller cross section. At present TESLA beam\nparameters the \u03b3\u03b3 luminosity is determined only by the attainable geometric Lee\nluminosity.\nRecently it was found that horizontal emittance at TESLA damping ring can\nbe reduced by a factor of 4 in comparison with the previous design. The resulting\nparameters of the photon collider at TESLA for 2E=500 GeV and H(130) are\npresented in Table 2 [3].\nFigures for the luminosity distribution in \u03b3\u03b3 and \u03b3e collisions can be found\nelsewhere [3].\n\n\fTABLE 2.

Having beams with smaller emittances one can get higher \u03b3\u03b3 luminosity,\nwhile e+ e\u2212 luminosity is restricted by beam collision effects.\nTypical cross sections of interesting processes in \u03b3\u03b3 collisions are higher than\nthose in e+ e\u2212 collisions by about one order of magnitude [2\u20134], so the number of\nevents in \u03b3\u03b3 collisions will be more than that in e+ e\u2212 collisions. For example, the\ncross section for production of H + H \u2212 pairs in collisions of polarized photons is\nhigher than that in e+ e\u2212 collisions by a factor of 20 (not far from the threshold);\nthis means 8 times higher production rate for the luminosities given above.\n\nIV\n\nLASERS, OPTICS\n\nA key element of photon colliders is a powerful laser system which is used for e\u2192 \u03b3\nconversion. Lasers with the required flash energies (several J) and pulse duration\n\u223c 1 ps already exist. The main problem is the high repetition rate, about 10\u201315\nkHz, with a pulse structure repeating the time structure of the electron bunches.\nThe most attractive and reliable solution at this moment is an \"optical storage\nring\" (fig.1), with a diode pump laser injector. This approach can be considered as\na base-line solution for the TESLA photon collider [3].\nThe laser pulses are send to the interaction region where they are trapped in an\noptical storage ring. Each bunch makes about 6 round trips (12 collisions with the\n\n\fP\n\nTFP\n\n\u2206 T(loop)= 337 ns\n\n11\n00\n\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n\ne\n\ne\n12\n\n2\n\n11\n00\n00\n11\n00\n11\n\n2 ps\n\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n\n\u2206 T(loop)= 337 ns\n\n111\n000\n111\n000\n\nin\n\n1\n0\n\n\u03bb/4\n\nc)\n\nout\n\nmulti-pass scheme 1\n\n1\n0\n0\n1\n\n\u03bb/4\n\nFIGURE 1.

All these tricks can be done by\nswitching one Pockels cell (2 round trips are possible without Pockels cell).\nA laser system required for a such optical storage ring can consist of about 8\nlasers of 1.5 kW average power each. Due to the high average power and reliability\nthe lasers should be based on diode pumping. This technology is developed very\nactively for a inertial fusion. Present cost of diodes for such laser system is about\n25 M$ and it is expected that their cost will be further decreased several times.\nSuch system can be done now: all technologies exist.\n\nV\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe luminosity in \u03b3\u03b3 collisions (in the high energy peak) can reach about 40%\nof e+ e\u2212 luminosity. Since cross sections in \u03b3\u03b3 collisions are typically higher by\none order of magnitude than those in e+ e\u2212 collisions and because of access to\nhigher masses for some particles, the photon collider now has very serious physics\nmotivation. There is good scheme for the laser system, which, it seems, can be\nbuild now.\n\nREFERENCES\n1. I. Ginzburg, G. Kotkin, V. Serbo, V. Telnov,Nucl.Instr. & Meth. 205 (1983) 47\n(Prepr.
