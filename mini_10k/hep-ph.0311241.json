Giuria 1, I\u201310125 Torino, Italy\n\nTalk presented at IFAE 2003, Lecce, 23-26 April 2003\n\nThe standard theory of neutrino oscillations has been formulated in the\nmiddle 70's (see Ref. [1]) on the basis of some assumptions that we are going\nto review critically. The main assumptions are four:\n(A1) Neutrinos are ultrarelativistic particles.\n(A2) Neutrinos produced or detected in CC weak interaction processes are\ndescribed by the flavor states\nX\n\u2217\n|\u03bd\u03b1 i =\n|\u03bdk i ,\n(1)\nU\u03b1k\nk\n\nwhere U is the unitary mixing matrix, \u03b1 = e, \u03bc, \u03c4 , and |\u03bdk i is the state\nof a neutrino with mass mk .\n(A3) The propagation time T is equal to the source-detector distance L.\n(A4) The massive neutrino states |\u03bdk i in Eq. (1) have the same momentum,\npk = pq\u2243 E (\"equal momentum assumption\"), and different energies,\nEk = p2 + m2k \u2243 E+m2k /2E, where E is the neutrino energy neglecting mass effects and the approximations are valid for ultrarelativistic\nneutrinos.\n\n1\n\n\fThe assumption (A1) is correct, because neutrino masses are smaller\nthan about one eV (see Refs. [2, 3]) and only neutrinos with energy larger\nthan about 100 keV can be detected (see the discussion in Ref. [4]). As we\nwill see, the ultrarelativistic character of neutrinos implies the correctness of\nthe assumptions (A2) and (A3) and the irrelevance of the assumption (A4),\nwhich is not realistic.\nIn Ref. [5] it has been shown that the assumption (A2) is not exact,\nbecause the amplitude of production and detection of the massive neutrino\n\u2217 (see also Ref. [4]). In the ultrarelativistic\n\u03bdk is not simply given by U\u03b1k\napproximation the characteristics of the production and detection processes\nthat depend on the neutrino mass can be neglected, leading to a correct\napproximate description of flavor neutrinos through the states (1) (see also\nRef. [6]).\nThe assumption (A3) follows from the ultrarelativistic approximation,\nbecause ultrarelativistic particles propagate almost at the velocity of light.\nHowever, in the standard theory of neutrino oscillations massive neutrinos\nare treated as plane waves, which are limitless in space and time. In order to\njustify the assumption (A3) it is necessary to treat massive neutrinos as wave\npackets [7], which are localized on the production process at the production\ntime and propagate between the production and detection processes at a\nvelocity close to the velocity of light. Such wave packet treatment [7, 8, 4,\n9] yields the standard formula for the oscillation length. In addition, the\ndifferent group velocities of different massive neutrinos imply the existence\nof a coherence length for the oscillations, beyond which the wave packets of\ndifferent massive neutrinos do not jointly overlap with the detection process\n[10, 11].\nThe wave packet treatment of neutrino oscillations is also necessary for\na correct description of the momentum and energy uncertainties necessary\nfor the coherent production and detection of different massive neutrinos\n[12, 13, 9], whose interference generates the oscillations.\nLet us discuss now the assumption (A4), which has been shown to be unrealistic in Refs. [14, 9] on the basis of simple relativistic arguments. Indeed,\nthe relativistic transformation of energy and momentum implies that the\nequal momentum assumption cannot hold concurrently in different inertial\nsystems. On the other hand, the probability of flavor neutrino oscillations is\nindependent from the inertial system adopted for its measurement, because\nthe neutrino flavor is measured by observing charged leptons whose character is Lorentz invariant (e.g. an electron is seen as an electron in any system\nof reference). Therefore, the probability of neutrino oscillations is Lorentz\ninvariant [15, 16] and must be derived in a covariant way. In fact, the oscil-\n\n\flation probability has been derived without special assumptions about the\nenergies and momenta of the different massive neutrino components both\nin the plane wave approach [17, 15, 6] and in the wave packet treatment\n[7, 8, 14, 9].\nLet us briefly describe the covariant derivation of the neutrino oscillation\nprobability in the plane wave approach, in which the massive neutrino states\nin Eq. (1) evolve in space and time as plane waves:\n|\u03bdk (x, t)i = e\u2212iEk t+ipk x |\u03bdk i .\n\n(2)\n\nSubstituting Eq. (2) in Eq. (1) and P\nexpressing the |\u03bdk i on the right-hand\n\u2217 |\u03bd i), we obtain\nside in terms of flavor states (|\u03bdk i = \u03b2=e,\u03bc,\u03c4 U\u03b2k\n\u03b2\n!\nX\nX\n\u2217\n|\u03bd\u03b2 i ,\n(3)\nU\u03b1k e\u2212iEk t+ipk x U\u03b2k\n|\u03bd\u03b1 (x, t)i =\n\u03b2=e,\u03bc,\u03c4\n\nk\n\nwhich shows that at a distance x and after a time t from the production of\na neutrino with flavor \u03b1 the neutrino is a superposition of different flavors.\nThe probability of flavor transitions in space and time is given by\n2\n2\n\nP\u03bd\u03b1 \u2192\u03bd\u03b2 (x, t) = |h\u03bd\u03b2 |\u03bd\u03b1 (x, t)i| =\n\nX\n\n\u2212iEk t+ipk x\n\nU\u03b1k e\n\n\u2217\nU\u03b2k\n\n,\n\n(4)\n\nk\n\nwhich is manifestly Lorentz invariant.\nConsidering ultrarelativistic neutrinos, we apply now the assumption\n(A3), t \u2243 x = L, where L is the distance traveled by the neutrino between\nproduction and detection. The phase in Eq. (4) becomes\nEk t \u2212 pk x \u2243 (Ek \u2212 pk ) L =\n\nm2k\nm2\nEk2 \u2212 p2k\nL=\nL \u2243 k L.\nEk + pk\nEk + pk\n2E\n\n(5)\n\nIt is important to notice that Eq. (5) shows that the phases of massive\nneutrinos relevant for the oscillations are independent from any assumption\non the energies and momenta of different massive neutrinos, as long as the\nrelativistic dispersion relation Ek2 = p2k + m2k is satisfied. This is why the\nstandard derivation of the neutrino oscillation probability gives the correct\nresult, in spite of the unrealistic equal momentum assumption (A4).\nUsing the phase in Eq. (5), the oscillation probability as a function of\nthe distance L has the standard expression\n!\n2 L\nX\nX\n\u2206m\nkj\n\u2217\n\u2217\n,\nP\u03bd\u03b1 \u2192\u03bd\u03b2 (L) =\n|U\u03b1k |2 |U\u03b2k |2 + 2Re\nU\u03b1k U\u03b2k\nU\u03b1j\nU\u03b2j exp \u2212i\n2E\nk\n\nk>j\n\n(6)\n\n\fwhich depends on the squared-mass differences \u2206m2kj = m2k \u2212 m2j . Let us\nnotice that the expression (6) is still Lorentz invariant, as shown in Ref. [16],\nbecause L is not the instantaneous source-detector distance but the distance\ntraveled by the neutrino between production and detection.\nIn conclusion, the standard expression for the probability of neutrino\noscillations is robust and can be derived starting from realistic assumptions\nin the plane wave approach [17, 15, 6], in a quantum mechanical wave packet\ntreatment [7, 8, 14, 9] and in the framework of Quantum Field Theory (see\nRef. [13] and references therein).\n\nReferences\n[1] S.M. Bilenky and B. Pontecorvo, Phys. Rept. 41 (1978) 225.\n[2] S.M. Bilenky, C. Giunti, J. A. Grifols and E. Masso, Phys.
