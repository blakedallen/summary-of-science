On the basis of a model for higher-order terms in the perturbative series, which\nincorporates well-known structure from renormalons, it is found that FOPT smoothly approaches the Borel sum\nfor the \u03c4 hadronic width, while CIPT is unable to account for the resummed series. An example for the behaviour\nof QCD spectral function moments, displaying a similar behaviour, is presented as well.\n\nThe dispersion in these results dominantly originates from different treatments of the renormalisation group (RG) resummation of the perturbative series, namely fixed-order perturbation theory (FOPT), or contour-improved perturbation\ntheory (CIPT) [9,10], being systematically larger\nthan the last included term in the expansion,\nwhich often in asymptotic series provides an estimate of the uncertainty due to higher-order terms\nnot included in the partial sum. This points to\nthe necessity of investigating the influence of different RG resummations in more detail, which\ncan for example be performed within exactly resummable models for the perturbative series.\nMost suitable for the \u03b1s determination is the\n\u03c4 decay rate into light u and d quarks R\u03c4,V /A\nvia a vector or axialvector current, since in this\ncase power corrections are especially suppressed.\nTheoretically, R\u03c4,V /A takes the form [1]\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\nHadronic decays of the \u03c4 lepton provide an excellent playground for the study of QCD at low\nenergies. Its mass of M\u03c4 \u2248 1.8 GeV is in an energy region where perturbation theory is still applicable, but also non-perturbative effects come\ninto play and need to be included. These may\narise from vacuum-condensate terms in the framework of the operator product expansion (OPE)\nand from so-called duality-violating contributions\nclose to the physical, Minkowskian energy axis.\nIn the seminal article [1], the strategy for a precise determination of the QCD coupling \u03b1s from\nthe total \u03c4 hadronic width\nR\u03c4 \u2261\n\n\u0393[\u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 hadrons \u03bd\u03c4 (\u03b3)]\n= 3.640(10) , (1)\n\u0393[\u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 e\u2212 \u03bd e \u03bd\u03c4 (\u03b3)]\n\nwas developed, while in the subsequent years moments of spectral \u03c4 -decay distributions were incorporated into the analyses as well [2,3,4].\nThe analytical computation of the perturbative\norder \u03b14s correction [5] has recently revived the\ninterest in \u03b1s analyses from hadronic \u03c4 decays\nwhich after evolution to the Z boson mass scale\nresulted in the following determinations:\n\uf8f1\n0.1202 (6)exp(18)th [5] ,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 0.1212 (5) (9)\n[6] ,\nexp\nth\n\u03b1s (MZ2 ) =\n(2)\n\uf8f4 0.1180 (4)exp(7)th [7] ,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n0.1187 (6)exp(15)th [8] .\n\nR\u03c4,V /A =\n\nh\nNc\nSEW |Vud |2 1 + \u03b4 (0)\n2\ni\nX (D)\n\u2032\n+ \u03b4EW\n+\n\u03b4ud,V /A ,\n\n(3)\n\nD\u22652\n\n\u2032\nwhere SEW = 1.0198(6) [11] and \u03b4EW\n=\n0.0010(10) [12] are electroweak corrections, \u03b4 (0)\ncomprises the perturbative QCD correction, and\n(D)\nthe \u03b4ud,V /A denote quark mass and higher Ddimensional operator corrections which arise in\nthe framework of the OPE.\n\n1\n\n\f2\n2. PERTURBATIVE CORRECTION \u03b4 (0)\nBelow, only the purely perturbative correction\n\u03b4 (0) shall be considered, which gives the dominant\ncontribution to R\u03c4,V /A . In FOPT it takes the\ngeneral form\n(0)\n\u03b4FO\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n=\n\na(M\u03c42 )n\n\nn=1\n\nn\nX\n\nk cn,k Jk\u22121 ,\n\n(4)\n\nk=1\n\n(0)\n\nwhere a(\u03bc2 ) \u2261 a\u03bc \u2261 \u03b1s (\u03bc)/\u03c0, and cn,k are the\ncoefficients which appear in the perturbative expansion of the vector correlation function,\n\u03a0V (s) = \u2212\n\nNc\n12\u03c0 2\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nan\u03bc\n\nn=0\n\nn+1\nX\n\nThus, all contributions proportional to the coefficient cn,1 which in FOPT appear at all perturbative orders equal or greater than n are resummed\ninto a single term.\nNumerically, the two approaches lead to significant differences. Employing the recent average \u03b1s (MZ ) = 0.1184 [13], leading to \u03b1s (M\u03c4 ) =\n0.3186, in eqs. (4) and (8), one finds\n\ncn,k lnk\n\nk=0\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2212s\n\u03bc2\n\n\u0013\n\n.

Further details can for example be found\nin ref. [7]. Finally, the Jl are contour integrals in\nthe complex s-plane, which are defined by\nI\ndx\n1\n(1 \u2212 x)3 (1 + x) lnl (\u2212x) .

Inspecting the individual contributions from each order, up to O(\u03b15s )\nthe CIPT series appears to be better convergent.\nHowever, around the seventh order, the contour\nintegrals Jna (M\u03c42 ) change sign and thus at this order the contributions are bound to become small.\nTherefore, the faster approach to the minimal\nterm does not necessarily imply that CIPT gives\nthe closer approach to the true result for the resummed series.\n\n|x|=1\n\nThe first three, being required up to O(\u03b13s ), take\nthe numerical values\nJ0 = 1 ,\n\nJ1 = \u2212\n\n19\n12\n\n,\n\nJ2 =\n\n265\n72\n\n1\n3\n\n2\n\n\u2212 \u03c0 .

A PHYSICAL MODEL\nTo investigate whether FOPT or CIPT results\nin a better approximation to \u03b4 (0) , one requires a\nphysically motivated model for its series. Such a\nmodel was constructed in ref. [7] and is based on\nthe Borel transform of the Adler function DV (s):\nDV (s) \u2261 \u2212 s\n\n\u0003\nNc \u0002\nd\nb\n\u03a0V (s) \u2261\n1+D(s)\n. (12)\n2\nds\n12\u03c0\n\nIn the following discussion it is slightly more conb\nvenient to utilise the related function D(s).\nIts\nb\nBorel transform B[D](t)\nis defined by the relation\nb\nD(\u03b1)\n\u2261\n\nZ\u221e\n0\n\nb\ndt e\u2212t/\u03b1 B[D](t)\n.\n\n(13)\n\nb\nThe integral D(\u03b1),\nif it exists, gives the Borel sum\nof the original divergent series. It was found that\nb\nthe Borel-transformed Adler function B[D](t)\nobtains infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) renor-\n\n\f3\nmalon poles at positive and negative integer values of the variable u \u2261 9t/(4\u03c0), respectively\n[14,15,16]. (With the exception of u = 1.)\nApart from very low orders, where a dominance\nof renormalon poles close to u = 0 has not yet set\nin, intermediate orders should be dominated by\nthe leading IR renormalon poles, while the leading UV renormalon, being closest to u = 0, dictates the large-order behaviour of the perturbative expansion. Assuming that only the first two\norders are not yet dominated by the lowest IR\nrenormalons, one is led to the ansatz\n\nIR2\nIR3\nUV1\n\nTable 1\nRelative contributions (in %) of the different IR\nand UV renormalon poles to the Adler-function\ncoefficients c2,1 to c6,1 for the Borel model (14).\npole to the coefficients c2,1 to c6,1 is tabulated.\nThe sum of the contributions to c2,1 is close to\n100%, implying again that the polynomial term is\nalready small. Then, from c3,1 to c6,1 the leading\nIR pole at u = 2 is dominating the coefficients,\nbefore the leading UV pole at u = \u22121 takes over\nat even higher orders. (For the central model (14)\nthis happens around the 10th order [7].)\n\nb\nb 1UV ](u) + B[D\nb 2IR ](u) +\nB[D](u)\n= B[D\n\nb IR ](u) + dPO + dPO u , (14)\nB[D\n3\n0\n1\n\nIR\ndUV\n= \u2212 1.56*10\u22122 , dIR\n1\n2 = 3.16 , d3 = \u2212 13.5 ,\n\ndPO\n= 0.781 , dPO\n= 7.66 * 10\u22123 .\n0\n1\n\n(15)\n\nThe fact that the parameter dPO\nturns out to be\n1\nsmall implies that the coefficient c2,1 is already\nreasonably well described by the renormalon pole\ncontribution, although it was not used to fix the\nresidua. Therefore, one could set dPO\n= 0 and\n1\nactually work with a model which only has four\nparameters. The predicted value c5,1 = 280 then\nturns out very close to the estimate, which can be\nviewed as one test of the stability of the model.\nThis is also corroborated in table 1, where\nthe relative contributions of a certain renormalon\n\n0.26\n0.24\n\n(0)\n\n0.22\n0.2\n\n\u03b4\n\nwhich includes one UV renormalon at u = \u22121, the\ntwo leading IR renormalons at u = 2 and u = 3,\nas well as polynomial terms for the two lowest perturbative orders.

[7].\nB[D\np\nand dIR\nApart from the residues dUV\np , the full\np\nstructure of the renormalon pole terms is dictated by the OPE and the RG. Therefore, the\nmodel (14) depends on five parameters, the three\nIR\nIR\nresidua dUV\n1 , d2 and d3 , as well as the two polyPO\nnomial parameters d0 and dPO\n1 . These parameters can be fixed by matching to the perturbative\nb\nexpansion of D(s)\nup to O(\u03b15s ). Thereby, also the\nestimate for c5,1 is used.

The straight line represents the\nresult for the Borel sum of the series.\nThe implications of the model (14) for \u03b4 (0) in\nFOPT and CIPT is graphically represented in fig(0)\nure 1. The full circles denote the result for \u03b4FO\n(0)\nand the grey circles the one for \u03b4CI , as a function of the order n up to which the perturbative\nseries has been summed.

The order at which the series\nhave their smallest terms is indicated by the grey\ndiamonds. As is obvious from figure 1, FOPT\ndisplays the behaviour expected from an asymptotic series: the terms decrease up to a certain\norder around which the closest approach to the\nresummed result is found, and for even higher orders, the divergent large-order behaviour of the\nseries sets in. For CIPT, on the other hand, the\nasymptotic behaviour sets in earlier, and the series is never able to come close to the Borel sum.1\n\nIR3\nIR4\nUV1\n\nhand for low coefficients there are huge cancellations between the IR renormalon poles and also\nc2,1 is not well described at all. This entails that\na large, additional polynomial term is required.\nBesides, it appears unnatural that the residue of\nthe first IR renormalon pole at u = 2 is small, and\nstill there should be a natural size contribution of\nthe gluon condensate to the Adler function.\nA graphical account of the model with dIR\n2 = 0\nis presented in figure 2. As anticipated, now\nCIPT provides a good description of the Borel\nsum, while FOPT is able to come reasonably close\nto it around its minimal term, but generally is\nrather badly behaved.2 Nonetheless, again, the\nbehaviour observed in table 2 and figure 2 appears unnatural from the perspective of the structure of the Borel transform of the Adler function\nand should be considered less likely than the behaviour of the model (14) with the residues (15).\n\nc2,1\nc3,1 c4,1\nc5,1 c6,1\n\u2212743.3 \u2212140.5 49.1 98.9 99.1\n662.8\n244.2 47.7\n6.3 \u22127.2\n7.5\n\u22123.7 3.2 \u22125.2\n8.1\n\nTable 2\nRelative contributions (in %) of the different IR\nand UV renormalon poles to the Adler-function\ncoefficients c3,1 to c6,1 for the Borel model with\ndIR\n2 = 0.\n\n1 The\n\nsame conclusions had already been drawn in ref.

These would generally\nbe models where dIR\n2 is much smaller than the\nvalue quoted in eq. (15). While such models can\nat present not be excluded, the pattern of the\nindividual contributions appears more unnatural\nthan in the main model (14): the known cn,1 can\nonly be reproduced when one allows for large cancellations between the individual terms. Thus,\nthe behaviour generally expected from the presence of renormalon poles, namely dominance of\nleading IR poles at intermediate orders, would be\nlost.\nThis is apparent from table 2, which is the analog of table 1, but for a model where dIR\n2 is forced\nto be zero and an additional IR pole at u = 4\nis added, in order to be able to reproduce the\nknown Adler function coefficients.

Historically, the so-called\n2A\n\nsimilar behaviour was found in ref.

In the analyses [2,3],\nmoments with k = 1 and l = 0, 1, 2, 3 were taken\ninto account, such that also condensate contributions up to dimension-8 could be extracted in\naddition to \u03b1s . Therefore, it is of interest to analyse the behaviour of these moments in models of\nhigher orders of perturbation theory as well.\n0.014\n0.012\n\n0.008\n\n\u03b4\n\n(0)\n\n0.01\n\n0.006\n0.004\n0.002\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n8\n\n6\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\nPerturbative order n\n\n(0,12)\n\nFigure 3.

The straight\nline represents the result for the Borel sum of the\nseries.\nAn example of such an analysis is shown in figure 3 for the moment (1, 2). It is observed that,\nlike for \u03b4 (0) , CIPT is unable to provide a reasonable account of the full Borel sum. In contrast, FOPT comes close to the resummed result\nfor perturbative orders around the minimal term,\nthough it is obvious that this particular moment\ndisplays a very bad behaviour of the asymptotic\nseries, with only unsatisfactory convergence up\nto its minimal term. The example of the (1, 2)moment should motivate an exhaustive investigation of the moments employed in previous \u03b1s\nanalyses from hadronic \u03c4 decays, which will be\npresented in the near future.\n4. CONCLUSIONS\nModels of higher orders of perturbation theory allow for the study of different resummation\n\nprescriptions in the computation of the total \u03c4\nhadronic width, as well as related moments of\n\u03c4 decay spectral distributions. The most prominent methods are fixed-order perturbation theory\n(FOPT) and the so-called contour-improved perturbation theory (CIPT), which performs a partial resummation of running effects of the QCD\ncoupling \u03b1s in the integration along the complex\ncontour in the s-plane.\nA physically motivated model for the higherorder behaviour of the Adler function was presented in ref. [7], and is given in eq. (14). The\nmodel was based on the general structure of the\nBorel transform of the Adler function and the\nrenormalisation group equation. Furthermore,\nknowledge on the first four analytically available\ncoefficients c1,1 to c4,1 , as well as an estimate for\nthe fifth coefficient c5,1 , were incorporated.\nResults for \u03b4 (0) in the main model (14) were displayed in figure 1, and it is observed that while\nFOPT provides a good account of the full Borel\nsummation, CIPT is never able to come close to\nthe resummed value.3 This general behaviour\nhinges on the size of the residue of the first IR\nrenormalon pole at u = 2. In a model in which\nthis residue is set to zero by hand, on the contrary CIPT well describes the Borel sum, whereas\nFOPT, though approaching the resummed value\naround its minimal term, generally is rather badly\nbehaved. Models in which dIR\n2 \u2248 0, however, are\nonly able to reproduce the known Adler function\ncoefficients through large cancellations between\ndifferent IR renormalon contributions, which appears unnatural.\nIn the standard experimental extractions of \u03b1s\nfrom hadronic \u03c4 decays, also moments of the decay spectra are employed [2,3]. An example of\nthe behaviour of such a moment was shown in\nfigure 3. The repeatedly unacceptable behaviour\nof CIPT in this case and the also unsatisfactory\nconvergence of FOPT, suggest that such moments\nshould be investigated systematically, before their\n3 The\n\ngeneral behaviour of the Borel model is also supported by an independent approach where the perturbative series is conformally transformed into a series which\ndisplays better convergence properties than the original\nseries in powers of \u03b1s [19], though in this case a modified\nCIPT better converges towards the full result.\n\n\f6\nusefulness in \u03b1s determinations from hadronic \u03c4\ndecays is corroborated.\nA final topic, not touched upon at all so far,\nare violations of quark-hadron duality [20,21,22].\nLike the perturbative expansion in \u03b1s , also the\nOPE in inverse powers of s may be only asymptotic, and thus exponentially suppressed terms\ncould be relevant close to the Minkowskian axis\nwhere the bound states are situated. This was\ninvestigated in a model in [21] and the possible\ninfluence of duality violations in \u03c4 decay spectra\nwas studied in refs. [22]. Also here a more systematic investigation seems to be in order which\nwas initiated in [23] and will be continued in the\nfuture.\nHadronic \u03c4 decays have proven to be a very\nfruitful laboratory for the study of low-energy\nQCD and the extractions of fundamental QCD\nparameters like the coupling \u03b1s . However, there\nremain unresolved theoretical issues which taint\nthe precision of these determinations. Numerically the two most relevant appear to be the resummation of QCD running effects in the computation of the \u03c4 hadronic width and related decay\nmoments as well as duality violations. As far as\nthe former topic is concerned, a physically motivated model of the QCD Adler function favours\nthe use of FOPT, since generally it is better able\nto represent the fully resummed series.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe author would like to thank Martin Beneke\nfor a most enjoyable collaboration.
