We define a class of\n(\u01eb, p)-regular hypergraphs, that includes random hypergraphs, for which we can prove\nthe existence of a decomposition of almost all edges into type l Hamilton cycles, where\nl < k/2.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis paper follows a line of work initiated by Frieze and Krivelevich [1] and continued by\nFrieze, Krivelevich and Loh [3]. We are given a k-regular hypergraph H (k-graph) with\ncertain pseudo-random properties and we show that almost almost all of the edges of H can\nbe packed into edge disjoint Hamilton cycles of a particular type.\nThe paper [3] begins with a good survey of this question which we will only give a sketch\nhere. When k = 2 we are dealing with graphs. Frieze and Krivelevich [2] showed that the\nedge set of dense graphs with a certain pseudo-random structure typified by random graphs\ncould be almost decomposed into edge disjoint Hamilton cycles. Knox, K\u00fchn and Osthus [4]\ntightened the implied result when restricted to random graphs.\nThe paper [1] extended this to hypergraphs. There are various definitions of a Hamilton\ncycle in a hypergraph. We will use the following: Let H = (V = [n], E) be a k-graph i.e.\nE = {e1 , e2 , . . . , em } where ej is a k-subset of V for j = 1, 2, . . . , m. and let l < k be\ngiven where l | n. A Hamilton cycle of type l is a sequence f1 , f2 , . . . , f\u03bdl , \u03bdl = n/l of edges\nSl\ngi . The paper [1]\nwhere |gi = fi+1 \\ fi | = l for i = 1, 2, . . . , \u03bdl (f\u03bdl +1 = f1 ) and V = \u03bdi=1\ndeals with the case l \u2265 k/2 and described conditions under which almost all of the edges\nof a hypergraph could be partitioned into Hamilton cycles. The case l < k/2 could not be\n\u2217\n\nResearch supported in part by NSF award DMS-0753472.\n\n1\n\n\fhandled by the methods in [1], but [3] shows how to deal with the case k = 3, l = 1. The\npurpose of this paper is to extend the analysis of [3] to the case where k \u2265 4 and l < k/2.\nWe first give our notion of pseudo-randomness: We use the following notation throughout.\n\u0018\n\u0019\nk\u2212l\n2\u2264z=\nand q = lz\nsatisf ies k/2 < k \u2212 l \u2264 q < k.\nl\nDefinition 1. We say that an n-vertex k-graph H, is (\u01eb, p)-regular if the following holds. Let\nd \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , l} and let s \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , 2z + 2}. Given any s distinct (k \u2212 d)-sets, A1 , . . . , As ,\nS\nd\nsuch that | i Ai | \u2264 k + 2q, there are (1 \u00b1 \u01eb) nd! ps sets of d vertices, D, such that all of\nA1 \u222a D, . . . , As \u222a D are edges of H. 1\nWe now give our main theorem:\n\n2\n\nTheorem 1. Let k and l < k/2 be given. Let \u03b1 =\nlarge multiple of 2q and that \u01eb, n and p satisfy\n\n1\n.\n9+7z 3\n\nSuppose that n is a sufficiently\n\n\u01eb16z+12 np8z \u226b log8z+5 n.\nLet H be an (\u01eb, p)-regular k-graph with n vertices. Then H contains a collection of edge\ndisjoint Hamilton cycles of type l that contains all but at most \u01eb\u03b1 -fraction of its edges.\nOur bounds on parameters \u01eb, p are unlikely to be tight and it would be interesting to\nsharpen our bounds. In which case, we will not fight too hard for our bounds. In particular,\nwe will replace products (1 \u00b1 a\u01eb)(1 \u00b1 b\u01eb) and (1 \u00b1 a\u01eb)(1 \u00b1 b\u01eb)\u22121 by (1 \u00b1 (a + b + 1)\u01eb) without\nfurther comment. Furthermore, we are really only interested in the case where \u01eb is small and\nso we will always assume that \u01eb is sufficiently small for all such simplifications.\n\n2\n\nProof overview and organization\n\nThe key insight in the proof of Theorem 1 is the following connection between type l Hamilton\ncycles in H and Hamilton cycles in an associated digraph.\nDefinition 2. Given two ordered q-tuples of vertices v1 = (v1 , . . . , vq ), v2 = (vq+1 , . . . , v2q )\nof a k-uniform hypergraph H, we define\nei = ei (v1 , v2 ) = {vil+1 , vil+2 , . . . , vil+k }\n\nfor all i = 0, . . . , z \u2212 1.\n\n(1)\n\nWe say that v1 precedes v2 if the edges e0 , e1 , . . . , ez\u22121 are all present in H. We say that\n(v1 , v2 ) owns these edges.\n1\n2\n\nA = (1 \u00b1 \u01eb)B if (1 \u2212 \u01eb)B \u2264 A \u2264 (1 + \u01eb)B\nThe notation an \u226b bn is short for an /bn \u2192 \u221e as n \u2192 \u221e.\n\n2\n\n\fNotice that the edges e0 , . . . , ez\u22121 are all contained in {v1 , v2 , . . . , v2q }. e0 consists of the\nfirst k vertices of v1 v2 . We shift l places to the right to get e1 . We continue shifting by l\nplaces until a further shift would take us outside v1 v2 .\nFor a permutation \u03c3 = (v1 , v2 , . . . , vi = \u03c3(i), . . . , vn ) of the vertices of H, define a \u03bdq =\nn/q-vertex digraph D\u03c3 with vertex set V\u03c3 = {vi = (v(i\u22121)q+1 , . . . , viq ) : i = 1, 2, . . . , \u03bdq }.\nPlace an arc (directed edge) from vi to vj if and only if vi precedes vj . In this construction,\nHamilton cycles in D\u03c3 give rise to type l Hamilton cycles in H. Indeed the Hamilton cycle\n(w1 , w2 , . . . , wn/q ) of D\u03c3 where wi = (w(i\u22121)q+1 , . . . , wiq ) yields a Hamilton cycle in H made\nup from the edges owned by the arcs (wi , wi+1 ), i = 1, . . . , \u03bdq . This cycle is (e1 , e2 , . . . , e\u03bdl )\nwhere eaz+b = {w((a\u22121)z+b)l+1 , . . . , w((a\u22121)z+b)l+k } for a \u2208 [\u03bdq ] and b \u2208 {0, . . . , z \u2212 1}.\nWe want disjoint Hamilton cycles in D\u03c3 to yield disjoint cycles in H. This follows from the\nfact that the sets of edges owned by distinct arcs (va , vb ) and (vc , vd ) are disjoint. Suppose\nthen that some edge e of H is owned by both pairs. It follows from the definition of precedes\nthat the first element of e (in the order defined by \u03c3) is in va and vb and so a = b. The\nq + 1st element of e is in vc and vd and so c = d, contradiction.\nThe basic idea of the proof is to take a large number of random permutations \u03c31 , \u03c32 , . . . , \u03c3r\nand construct the digraphs D\u03c31 , D\u03c32 , . . . , D\u03c3r . Then take subgraphs D\u03c3\u2032 i \u2286 D\u03c3i for i =\n1, 2, . . . , r so that the edges of H owned by D\u03c3\u2032 i , D\u03c3\u2032 j are disjoint for i 6= j. It will be argued\nthat each D\u03c3\u2032 i has certain regularity properties implying that its arc set can be almost\ndecomposed into edge disjoint Hamilton cycles. We then take the edges owned by the arcs\nof all the Hamilton cycles in all the D\u03c3\u2032 i and remove them to create a new hypergraph H \u2032 .\nWe then argue that whp H \u2032 is (\u01eb\u2032 , p\u2032 )-regular. We repeat this process until we have covered\nalmost all of the edges of H by Hamilton cycles.\nWe now give the regularity properties that we require of our digraphs:\nDefinition 3. We say that a \u03bd-vertex digraph is (\u01eb, p)-regular if it satisfies the following\nproperties:\n(i) Every vertex a has out-degree d+ (a) = (1 \u00b1 \u01eb)\u03bdp and in-degree d\u2212 (a) = (1 \u00b1 \u01eb)\u03bdp.\n(ii) For every pair of distinct vertices a, b, all three of the following quantities are (1\u00b1\u01eb)\u03bdp2 :\nthe number of common out neighbors d+ (a, b), the number of common in neighbors\nd\u2212 (a, b), and the number d+\u2212 (a, b) of out-neighbors of a which are also in-neighbors of\nb.\n(iii) Given any four vertices a, b, c, d, which are all distinct except for the possibility b = c,\n\u2212 \u2212\n\u2212\n\u2192\n\u2192 \u2192\nthere are (1 \u00b1 \u01eb)\u03bdp4 vertices x such that \u2212\nax,\nxb, \u2192\ncx, xd are all directed edges.\nIn this context, we have the following Theorem of Frieze, Krivelevich and Loh [3]:\nTheorem 2. Suppose that \u01eb11 np8 \u226b log5 n, and n is a sufficiently large even integer. Then\nevery (\u01eb, p)-regular digraph can have its edges partitioned into a disjoint union of directed\nHamilton cycles, except for a set of at most \u01eb1/8 -fraction of its edges.\n3\n\n\fWe next describe our procedure for generating the D\u03c3\u2032 i :\nProcedure 1. This takes as input an (\u01eb, p)-regular k-graph H with number of vertices\ndivisible by q and an integer parameter r.

If Ie 6= \u2205, independently select a uniformly\nrandom index in Ie to label e with.\n(4) For each i, define the subgraph D\u03c3\u2032 i as follows: For each arc e = (v, v\u2032 ) of D\u03c3i , keep the\narc e if and only if all z of the edges owned by e are labeled with i.\n(5) For each i, let Hi\u2032 be the k-graph containing all hyperedges which are owned by the arcs\nof D\u03c3\u2032 i .\nOur main task is to prove\nLemma 1.

So we use the next two Lemmas to compute a first order estimate and a second order\nupper bound on several quantities.\nGiven a hyperedge e and a digraph Di from Procedure 1, edge e is owned by at most\none directed edge in Di . If this edge exists, let it be denoted ui (e). Now ui (e) owns exactly\nz hyperedges in Hi . If e is is an edge of Hi , let \u03c6i (e) be the set of z hyperedges owned by\nui (e). Note that \u03c6i (e) includes the edge e. We call \u03c6i (e)\\ {e} the partner edges of e in Hi .\nLemma 6. Condition on |Ie | = (1 \u00b1 (z + 2)\u01eb) \u03ba for each edge of H. Fix d \u2208 {1, . . . , l} and\nany set of k \u2212 d vertices, A = {a1 , . . . , ak\u2212d } \u2282 V (H). Fix a family B of d-sets of vertices\nsuch that A \u222a B is a hyperedge of H for all B \u2208 B. Suppose \u01eb2 |B| /\u03ba2z\u22121 \u226b log n.

Let B = {B1 , . . . , Bt } . Because we are conditioning on |Ie |, e \u2208 E(H), the relevant\nprobability space is the choice of labels in Step 3 of Procedure 1. Define F = F (A), the set\nof relevant edges, as follows: For each j such that A \u222a Bi \u2208 E(Hj ) there are exactly z \u2212 1\npartner edges Fi,j such that A \u222a Bi \u2208 E(Hj\u2032 ) if and only if all of these edges as well as A \u222a Bi\nS\nreceive label j. Let F = i,j Fi,j . Since we assume that each edge is in (1 \u00b1 (z + 2)\u01eb) \u03ba of\nthe Hj , we have that |F | \u2264 2z\u03ba |B|. The labels outside of F do not affect the count N, so\nwe may condition on an arbitrary setting of those labels leaving only the labels of F to be\nexposed.\nNow\n\"\n#\n[\nE(Hj\u2032 ) = [(1 \u00b1 (z + 2)\u01eb) \u03ba]\u2212(z\u22121) .\nPr A \u222a Bi \u2208\nj\n\nTo see this, expose the label of an edge A \u222a Bi . Suppose that it receives label j. Then all\nof its partner edges must also receive label j. Each of them is an edge of (1 \u00b1 (z + 2)\u01eb) \u03ba of\nthe Hk , and since their labelings are independent, the probability that each of them receive\nlabel j is as claimed above. So\n\u0001 |B|\nE [NB ] = |B| [(1 \u00b1 (z + 2)\u01eb) \u03ba]\u2212(z\u22121) = 1 \u00b1 (z 2 + z \u2212 1)\u01eb z\u22121\n\u03ba\n12\n\n\fOur probability space is a product space of dimension |F |. We use the Hoeffding-Azuma\ninequality to show that NB is concentrated. Suppose the label of an edge e \u2208 F is changed\nfrom i to j. Suppose that e is owned by the edge (v1 = (v1 , . . . , vq ), v2 = (vq+1 , . . . , v2q )) of\u0001\nDi . Let S = {v1 , . . . , v2q }. The definition of F implies that S \u2287 A. So at most 2q\u2212(k\u2212d)\nd\nsets from\u0001 B will be removed from the count NB by this switch in labels. Similarly,\nat\nmost\n\u0001\n2q\u2212(k\u2212d)\n2q\u2212(k\u2212d)\nsets from B will be added to the count NB .

Fix a set of k + t vertices S = {x1 , x2 , . . . , xk+t } = e1 \u222a e2 where e1 , e2 are edges of\nH.

Let \u03bat =\nnk\u22122 ql\n\n6(k+1) log n\n\u01eb2t\n\nand\n\nr = k!pz\u22121 \u03bat and consider Procedure 1 applied to Ht with these parameters. This produces\nt\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\ndigraphs Dt,i\nand k-graphs Ht,i\nwith all Ht,i\ndisjoint. Let Ht+1 be the k-graph which results\n\u2032\nfrom the deletion of all Ht,i from Ht . In order to apply Lemma 1 at each step, we must\n4z+1\ncheck that \u01eb8z+2\nnp8z\nn. This condition follows from our assumptions on \u01eb, n, p\nt\nt \u226b log\n1 \u03b1\nsince \u01ebt \u2265 \u01eb and pt \u2265 2 \u01eb p. So we have, with probability 1 \u2212 o(n\u22121 ), Procedure 2 results in\nthe following properties:\n\u2032\n\u2022 Every Dt,i\nis (12z 2 \u01ebt , (pt /\u03bat )z )-regular.\n\n\u2022 Ht+1 is (\u01ebt+1 , pt+1 )-regular.\nSince T = o(n), we may condition on this holding at each step. In order to apply the\n5\n\u2032\nz\nz 8\nresult on packing cycles in digraphs to each Dt,i\n, we must verify that \u01eb11\nt \u03bdq (pt /\u03bat ) \u226b log n.\nWe have\n\u0012 11+8z\u03b1+16z 8z \u0013\n\u0012 \u00138z\n\u01eb\nnp\npt\n11\n\u2265\u0398\n\u226b log5 n\n\u01ebt \u03bdq\n8z\n\u03bat\nlog n\n8z+5\n16z+12\n8z\n\u2032\nby our assumption that \u01eb\nnp \u226b log\nn since 8z\u03b1 \u2264 1. So every Dt,i\ncan be packed\n2\n1/8\nwith Hamilton cycles missing only (12z \u01ebt ) -fraction of its edges. As observed already,\n\u2032\nthese edge-disjoint Hamilton cycles in Dt,i\ncorrespond to edge disjoint Hamilton cycles in\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nHt,i . Hence the packing in Dt,i gives a packing in Ht,i\nmissing the same fraction of edges\n\u2032\n\u2032\nsince there is a z-to-1 correspondence between edges in Ht,i\nand Dt,i\n.\nThe above procedure is carried out until HT is created. Then Hamilton cycles have been\npacked in H\\HT , up to an error of (12z 2 \u01ebT \u22121 )1/8 -fraction. Let us estimate the fraction of\nedges present in HT itself. By applying (\u01eb, p)-regularity to H, we see that H had at least\n(1 \u2212 \u01eb)\n\nnk\nnk\np\u2265\np\nk!\nk! + 1\n17\n\n\fedges to begin with.\nSimilarly, we see that HT has at most\nnk\nnk \u03b1\nnk\n(1 + \u01ebT ) pT \u2264 (1 + \u01ebT )\n\u01eb p\u2264\np\u01eb\u03b1\nk!\n2 * k!\n2 * k! \u2212 1\nedges. Since k \u2265 3, we have that\n|HT |\n\u2264 c\u01eb\u03b1\n|H|\nwhere c < 1 is some constant.\nHence the fraction of edges of H not covered is at most\n(12z 2 \u01ebT \u22121 )1/8 * (1 \u2212 c\u01eb\u03b1 ) + c\u01eb\u03b1 \u2264 (12z 2 \u01ebT \u22121 )1/8 + c\u01eb\u03b1 \u2264 \u01eb\u03b1 ,\n1/8\n\nsince \u01ebT \u22121 \u226a \u01eb\u03b1 .\n\nReferences\n[1] A.M.
