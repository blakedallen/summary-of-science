Here we report data on\nJ/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c9K + K \u2212 . Earlier data on this channel with lower statistics have been\npublished by Mark I [2], DM2 [3] and Mark III [4].\nThe BES II detector is a large solid-angle magnetic spectrometer that is described in detail in Ref. [5]. Charged particles are measured in a vertex chamber and Main Drift Chamber (MDC); these are surrounded by a solenoidal\nmagnet providing a nearly uniform field of 0.4T. Photons are detected in a\nBarrel Shower Counter (BSC) made of gas proportional tubes interleaved with\n12 radiation lengths of lead sheets. A time-of-flight (TOF) hodoscope immediately outside the MDC provides separation between pions, kaons, and protons.\nThe time resolution of the TOF measurement is 180 ps. Further separation is\nobtained using dE/dx in the MDC.\nThe point of closest approach of a charged track to the beam is required to be\nwithin 2 cm of the beam axis and within 20 cm of the centre of the interaction\nregion along the beam axis. Both photons are required to be isolated from\ncharged tracks by demanding an angle > 8\u25e6 to the nearest charged track. Any\nphoton with an energy deposit < 30 MeV in the shower counter is rejected.\nAll particles are required to lie well within the acceptance of the detector,\nwith charged tracks having laboratory polar angles \u03b8 satisfying | cos \u03b8| < 0.84\nand with transverse momenta > 60 MeV/c.\nThe \u03c9 is observed decaying to \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 , so events are selected initially by\ndemanding two photons and four charged tracks with total charge zero. If\nthere are more than two photons, all are tried; an extra photon can arise from\ninteractions of charged particles in the detector. Kaons can be identified up to\nmomenta of 800 MeV/c by TOF and dE/dx measurements. The two slowest\nparticles always have energies < 800 MeV. The first step is to identify one\nkaon and one pion using TOF and dE/dx. The other two tracks often have\nmomenta too high to be identified by TOF and dE/dx, so a four-constraint\nkinematic fit is made for the K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3\u03b3 hypothesis. The kinematic fit\nrequires \u03c72 (K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3\u03b3) < 40.\nThe \u03c0 0 is selected by requiring |M\u03b3\u03b3 \u2212 M\u03c00 | < 0.020 GeV/c2 ; the \u03c0 0 mass\nresolution is \u223c 15 MeV/c2 . The resulting \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 mass distribution is shown\nin Fig. 1. The \u03c9 signal is then selected requiring |M\u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212 \u03c00 \u2212M\u03c9 | \u2264 40 MeV/c2 .\nThe background is fitted by a second order polynomial in M(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 ). A\nbackground of (22.9 \u00b1 2.0)% is estimated from \u03c9 sidebands, defined by 80 \u2264\n|M\u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212 \u03c00 \u2212 M\u03c9 | \u2264 160 MeV/c2 ; the error allows for small variations when the\nlocation and width of the sidebins are changed.\nFor a given \u03c9 momentum, the mass of the accompanying K K\u0304 pair is unique.\n3\n\n\fThe decay angles of \u03c0\u03c0 and K K\u0304 in the lab frame are very different except\nnear 0 or 180\u25e6 . There, the backward \u03c0 or K differ strongly in momentum and\nare easily distinguished by momentum, TOF, and dE/dx. As a result, there\nis a clean separation between \u03c9\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and \u03c9K + K \u2212 .\n\nEvents/(2MeV/c2)\n\nMost background originates from K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 . The other sources of background are KS0 in final states KS0 K \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 \u03c0 0 and KS0 K \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 \u03b3. Most KS events are\nrejected as follows. If \u03c72 (KS0 K \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 \u03b3\u03b3) < \u03c72 (K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3\u03b3) or \u03c72 (KS0 K \u00b1 \u03c0 \u2213 \u03b3) <\n\u03c72 (K + K \u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b3\u03b3), events are discarded if any K\u03c0\u03c0\u03c0 combination has M(\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 )\nin the interval 497 \u00b1 25 MeV/c2 and rxy > 3 mm; here rxy is the distance from\nthe beam axis to the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 vertex. This avoids rejecting too many signal\nevents; surviving KS background is too small to be visible. The beam spot\nhas a \u03c3x of 0.6 mm, and the resolution of the second vertex is 1.2 mm in\nxy. After the background subtraction, there are 3438 signal events. From the\nMonte Carlo simulation, the average detection efficiency is 4.0%.\n\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n0.9\n1\n+ - 0\n2\nMass(\u03c0 \u03c0 \u03c0 ) (GeV/c )\n\nFig. 1.

[6].\nFor spin 0 in K K\u0304, two transitions from J/\u03c8 are allowed with orbital angular\nmomenta l = 0 and 2 in the production process. For spin 2, there are five\namplitudes: one with l = 0, three with l = 2 and one with l = 4. In fitting\nthese, Blatt-Weisskopf centrifugal barrier factors are included with a radius of\n0.8 fm, though results are insensitive to this choice. In the amplitude analysis,\ninformation from the \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 decay is included in the tensor expressions.\nThe polarisation vector of the \u03c9 lies along the normal to its decay plane. The\ncorrelation between this polarisation vector, the production plane, and the\ndecay of the fJ to K + K \u2212 is sensitive to the spin of fJ and also to the helicity\namplitudes for its production. This correlation cannot readily be displayed,\nsince it depends on five angles; however, tests with different J P demonstrate\nthe sensitivity to quantum numbers.\nFig. 2(b) shows the Dalitz plot from the log likelihood fit described below.\nHistograms on Figs. 2(e) and (f) show projections of f0 and f2 contributions\nto this fit.\nThe \u03c9\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 data of Ref. [1] determine all helicity amplitudes for production\nof f2 (1270) well. In fitting present data, the relative magnitudes of these amplitudes are fixed to values from \u03c9\u03c0\u03c0. Contributions from f0 (980) are likewise\nfixed from the signal observed in \u03c9\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ; its branching ratio K K\u0304/\u03c0\u03c0 is taken\nfrom the Flatt\u00e9 formula fitted to J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and \u03c6K + K \u2212 [7], where there\nare conspicuous f0 (980) signals. Phases for f2 (1270) and f0 (980) amplitudes\nare fitted freely, since they arise from multiple scattering, which is different in\nK K\u0304 and \u03c0\u03c0 final states.\nFor other components, there is a general problem in isolating f0 from possible\nf2 for two reasons. Firstly, five 2+ amplitudes can simulate two 0+ amplitudes\nclosely; amplitudes with J P = 2+ may be identified if they give rise to decay\nangular distributions which are non-isotropic. Secondly, fitted 2+ amplitudes\ncan fluctuate for angles outside the acceptance. For high K + K \u2212 mass above 2\nGeV/c2 , this latter problem is somewhat reduced, because the l = 4 amplitude\nis suppressed by the strong centrifugal barrier for production.\nWe use \u03c3 to denote a broad K + K \u2212 S-wave contribution. We find that it peaks\ntowards the lower K K\u0304 masses as shown by the dashed curve of Fig. 2(e).\nHowever, the dependence on mass above 1 GeV is somewhat uncertain. Many\nalternative fits have been tried with similar results. A component peaking\n6\n\n\ftowards threshold is required; without it, the fit to the K K\u0304 mass distribution\nof Fig. 2(c) is bad. We have therefore tried parametrisations using the \u03c3 pole\nof Ref. [1], and a coupling constant of the form G1 + G2 s or G1 + G2 /s.\nThe optimum fit requires a slightly more rapid fall with s than the \u03c3 pole,\nin order to fit four points at the lowest K K\u0304 masses. However, we regard\nthis as unphysical and therefore eventually choose to use the \u03c3 pole of Ref.\n[1] unchanged, with G2 = 0. Note that there is a substantial constructive\ninterference in present data between f0 (980) and \u03c3 amplitudes at masses close\nto threshold.\nA dominant feature is f0 (1710); the present data are consistent with earlier\nstudies which identify J = 0 [8,9]. They are also consistent with the absence of any significant J = 2 contribution. The fitted f0 (1710) optimises at\nM = 1738 \u00b1 30 MeV/c2 , \u0393 = 125 \u00b1 20 MeV/c2 . The error in the mass is\nmostly systematic, and arises from uncertainty in the \u03c3 amplitude with which\nf0 (1710) interferes; the error in \u0393 is mostly statistical, but includes allowance\nfor interference with the remaining 0+ amplitude. Earlier BES II data on\n2\nJ/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03b3K + K \u2212 and \u03b3KS0 KS0 gave M = 1740 \u00b1 4(stat)+10\n\u221225 (syst) MeV/c and\n+15\n2\n\u0393 = 166+5\n\u22128 \u221210 MeV/c [8].\nA fit to the 1738 MeV/c2 peak with spin 2 uses five amplitudes and gives log\nlikelihood worse than spin 0 by only 15; the fit is shown in Fig. 3. However,\nthe fit with spin 0 uses only two production amplitudes with l = 0 and 2. The\nfit with spin 0 requires an l = 0 amplitude which is completely dominant over\nl = 2. However, for spin 2 the l = 2 amplitudes dominate over l = 0. The\nphase space available in the process J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c9fJ (1710) is rather limited, and\nthe l = 2 and 4 centrifugal barriers for the production process should suppress\nthose amplitudes strongly. If the l = 2 and 4 amplitudes are removed, spin 0\ngives a fit better than spin 2 by 90 in log likelihood.\nThis pattern of behaviour is symptomatic of what is required for spin 2 to\nsimulate spin 0. The spin 2 amplitude with l = 0 has a unique dependence\non angles; it contains a distinctive term 3 cos2 \u03b1K \u2212 1, where \u03b1K is the decay\nangle of the K + in the resonance rest frame, with respect to the direction of\nthe recoil \u03c9. Simulation of spin 0 requires large J = 2 l = 2 and 4 amplitudes\nto produce compensating terms in sin2 \u03b1K . Although this is suspicious, the\nJ = 2 possibility cannot be ruled out from present data.\nWe discuss next the branching ratio of f0 (1710) between K K\u0304 and \u03c0\u03c0, using information from J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c9\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 [1], where statistics of \u223c 40K events\nare available. In those data, there is no definite evidence for the presence of\nf0 (1710) ; if its mass is scanned, there is no optimum around 1710 MeV/c2 ,\nand the fitted f0 (1710) is only 0.43 \u00b1 0.21% of \u03c9\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 . In the \u03c9K + K \u2212 data\npresented here, the f0 (1710) intensity is (38 \u00b1 6)% of the data within the\nsame acceptance as for \u03c9\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ; the error is almost entirely systematic, and\n7\n\n\f2\n\nEvents/(25MeV/c )\n\n200\n\n200\n\n150\n\n150\n\n100\n\n100\n\n50\n\n50\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n0\n\n2\n+ -\n\n1\n\n2\n\nM(K K ) (GeV/c )\n\n1.5\n\n2\n+ -\n\n2\n\nM(K K ) (GeV/c )\n\nFig. 3.

The branching fraction for J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c9f0 (1710), f0 (1710) \u2192 K + K \u2212\nis (6.6 \u00b1 1.3) \u00d7 10\u22124 . We find at the 95% confidence level\nBR(f0 (1710) \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0)\n< 0.11,\nBR(f0 (1710) \u2192 K K\u0304)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere all charge states for decay are taken into account.\nOne caveat is necessary. In our study of J/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 and \u03c6K + K \u2212 [7], definite evidence is found for an f0 (1770), distinct from f0 (1710) and decaying to\n\u03c0\u03c0 (and possibly weakly to K K\u0304). There is a remote possibility that f0 (1710)\nand f0 (1770) are both present in \u03c9\u03c0\u03c0 data but cancel by destructive interference. Such a cancellation would require that they have the same magnitudes\nbut opposite phases. Even then, the cancellation is incomplete, because they\nhave different masses and widths. Allowing for this possible cancellation, the\nupper limit of the branching ratio given in eqn. (1) could increase to 0.16 if\nthe magnitudes happen to be equal, which is unlikely.\nThe peak in Fig. 2(c) at \u223c 1550 MeV/c2 may be fitted with either f2\u2032 (1525)\nor f2 (1565), or both. Spin 2 is required by non-isotropic decay angular distributions; a fit with an f0 with the same mass and width gives a worse log\nlikelihood by 64. Also no f0 (1500) is visible in the \u03c9\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 data of Ref. [1].\nIf the peak is fitted with f2\u2032 (1525), the branching fraction is close to that for\nf2 (1270) \u2192 K K\u0304. However, because of interferences between helicity amplitudes, the branching fraction could be a factor 2 larger or smaller. If the peak\nis fitted with f2 (1565), the branching fraction is similar to that of f2 (1565)\nin \u03c9\u03c0\u03c0 data, but again could be a factor 2 larger or smaller. The fit shown\nin Fig. 2 uses f2\u2032 (1525). The branching ratio of f2 (1270) between K K\u0304 and \u03c0\u03c0\n8\n\n\fis (5.2 \u00b1 2.5)%, consistent with the range of values quoted by the Particle\nData Group [9]; again the error arises from flexibility in interferences between\nhelicity amplitudes.\n\nEvents/bin\n\nThere is a further feature at \u223c 2150 MeV/c2 in the K + K \u2212 mass spectrum.\nSome spin \u2265 2 component is required by non-isotropic decay angular distributions. An optimum fit to present data may be achieved with a mass of\n2150 \u00b1 20 MeV/c2 and a width \u0393 = 150 \u00b1 30 MeV/c2 ; these values are within\na few MeV/c2 of PDG values. Errors are mostly statistical but also cover\nchanges when the small amplitudes are omitted from the fit. The data do not\nrule out the possibility of spin 4, but the fit is consistent with the known\nf2 (2150) [9].\n\n150\n100\n\n100\n\n50\n\n50\n\n0\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n0\n\n\u03c7\n\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\ncos\u03b8\u03c9\n\n150\n100\n100\n\n75\n50\n\n50\n25\n0\n\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\ncos\u03b1K\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\ncos\u03b2\u03c9\n\nFig. 4.

The dashed histograms show the acceptance.\n\nFig. 4 shows distributions for four angles after selecting MKK > 2000 MeV/c2 .\nThe angle \u03c7 is the angle between the decay plane of \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 and the\ndecay plane X \u2192 K K\u0304; \u03b8\u03c9 is the production angle of the \u03c9 in the J/\u03c8 rest\n9\n\n\fframe. The angle \u03b1K is the decay angle of the K in the rest frame of X,\ntaken with respect to the direction of the recoil \u03c9; \u03b2\u03c9 is the angle between\nthe normal to the \u03c9 decay plane and the beam direction. The distribution for\ncos \u03b1K is distinctly non-isotropic, although after integrating over all but one\nof the angles, much of the spin information is lost; the full amplitude analysis\nis much more reliable than projections on to individual angles. The dashed\ncurves illustrate the acceptance.

The projection on to M (\u03c9K \u00b1 ) omitting the \u03c9K signal at 1945 MeV/c2 .\n\nThe \u03c9K mass distribution is fitted poorly unless a component decaying to\n\u03c9K is included with M \u223c 1945 MeV/c2 , \u0393 \u223c 270 MeV/c2 . Fig. 5 shows the\npoor fit without this additional amplitude; no background appears capable\nof explaining this effect. The optimum fit is obtained with orbital angular\nmomentum l = 0 in the \u03c9K system, i.e. J P = 1+ ; this improves log likelihood\nby 113, and contributes 9.4% of all events. The observed isotropic decay can be\nfitted not only by J P = 1+ , but through conspiracy between several production\namplitudes for J P = 2\u2212 and 0\u2212 . The known K2 (1820) with J P = 2\u2212 and\nK(1830) with J P = 0\u2212 [9] do not alone give an adequate fit but may make\nsome contribution. Our conclusion is that some \u03c9K contribution is needed in\nthis mass range, but cannot be identified cleanly and could be a superposition\nof more than one resonance with J P = 1+ , 0\u2212 and 2\u2212 . Conclusions about f0\nand f2 components are insensitive to this ambiguity. At lower masses, inclusion\nof K1 (1400) \u2192 \u03c9K also gives a significant improvement of 81 in log likelihood.\nIn summary, the main features of the data are peaks which may be attributed\nto f0 (1710), f2 (2150), f2 (1270) and either f2\u2032 (1525) or f2 (1565). An upper limit\nof 0.11 is set on the ratio BR[f0 (1710) \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0]/BR[f0 (1710) \u2192 K K\u0304]. This\n10\n\n\fupper limit could rise to 0.16 if there is a fortuitous cancellation of f0 (1710)\nand f0 (1770) in \u03c9\u03c0\u03c0 data in both magnitude and phase.\n\nThe BES collaboration thanks the staff of BEPC for their hard efforts.
