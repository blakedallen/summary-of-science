Calculation of the dynamic spin response for stripes in\nthe diagonal phase yields the characteristic hour glass dispersion with the crossing of low energy\nGoldstone and high-energy branches at a characteristic energy Ecross at the antiferromagnetic wavevector QAF .

From these experiments it turns\nout that above doping nh = 0.055 the stripes are oriented along the Cu-O bond direction ('vertical stripes')\nand the incommensurability \u03b4 (defined as the deviation\nof the magnetic peak from QAF ) linearly increases up to\nnh \u2248 1/8 [3]. Above nh \u2248 1/8, \u03b4 stays essentially constant but the intensity of the low energy spin fluctuations\ndecreases and vanishes at the same concentration where\nsuperconductivity disappears in the overdoped regime\nthus suggesting an intimate relation between both phenomena [4].\nUpon lowering the doping below nh \u2248 0.055 the incommensurability \u03b4 rotates by 450 [5, 6, 7, 8] to the diagonal\ndirection and the orthorhombic lattice distortion allows\none to conclude that the elastic diagonal magnetic scattering is one-dimensional with the associated modulation\nalong the orthorombic b\u2217 -axis. When \u03b4 is measured in\nunits of reciprocal tetragonal lattice units in both the vertical and diagonal phase it turns out that the magnitude\nof the incommensurability numerically coincides across\nthe rotation leading to a linear relation \u03b4 = x.

Our\nresults suggest that in the spin glass phase incommensurate scattering is due to a disordered mixture of bond\ncentered and site centered diagonal stripe configurations.\nCalculations are based on the one-band Hubbard model\n(on-site repulsion U ) with hopping restricted to nearest\n(\u223c t) and next nearest (\u223c t\u2032 ) neighbors. We first treat\nthe model within an unrestricted Gutzwiller approximation (GA) which leads to the stripe textures[11]. On top\nof this we obtain the spin excitations within the time\ndependent Gutzwiller approximation[12, 13]. Parameters are U/t = 7.5, t\u2032 /t = \u22120.2 and t = 340meV [14].\n\n\f2\n0.07\n\nincommensurability \u03b5 (r.l.u.)\n\nIn previous papers we have shown that our approach\ncan reproduce both, the magnon excitations of undoped\nLCO[14] as revealed by neutron scattering[15] and the\ndoping dependent incommensurability in the vertical\nstripe phase[16, 17]. In addition, the formalism leads to\nquantitative agreement with the dispersion of spin excitations in LBCO[14, 18, 19] and can reproduce the doping\ndependence of the optical conductivity[20].\nFig. 1 shows the charge and magnetization profile for\nthe diagonal stripe structures we have obtained as stable\nsaddle-point solutions within the GA. The first is a site\ncentered diagonal (DSC) stripe where the doped holes\nare confined to nonmagnetic sites which simultaneously\nconstitute the antiphase boundary for the AF order parameter.\nThe second stable texture (Fig. 1, right panel) can be\nconsidered as the diagonal counterpart to vertical bondcentered (VBC) stripes. However, due to the diagonal\norientation the stripe acquires a net ferromagnetic moment. Moreover, the magnetization points in the same\ndirection (i.e. the whole layer becomes ferromagnetic)\nwhen the BC stripes are separated by an odd number of\nlattice constants in x- (or y-) direction. They can be considered as the smallest 'staircase' variant as discussed by\nGranath [21]. We have found that more extended 'staircase' structures are higher in energy and do not yield\nstable magnetic excitations.\nThe approximate linear relation between incommensurability and filling at low doping[3, 5, 6, 7, 8] implies\nthat isolated stripes are self-bounded linear aggregations\nof holes with a well defined number of holes per Cu along\nthe stripe given by \u03bdopt \u2261 nh /\u01eb. Indeed as for vertical\nstripes[16, 17] we find an optimum filling, however, an\nimportant difference here is that \u03bdopt depends substantially on the texture. DSC are insulating (the Fermi level\nfalls in a gap) with \u03bdopt \u2248 1, thus \u01eb \u2248 nh . Diagonal BC\n(DBC) stripes are metallic and have an optimum filling\nat \u03bdopt \u2248 0.75 implying \u03b4 \u2248 nh [22].\nWhile DBC stripes are practically (accidentally) degenerate in energy with low doping VBC, the energy of\nthe DSC texture is \u2248 0.02t per hole above [22]. We believe that these small energy differences are not significant given the simplicity of the model. A precise determination of the relative stability of the different phases\nwould require at least multiorbital effects, inclusion of\nboth long-range Coulomb interactions and coupling of\nthe holes to the tilts of the CuO4 octahedra. The latter\nhave been shown to play a major role in the stabilization\nof vertical vs. diagonal stripes[23]. On the other hand\nwe believe that results within one phase are much more\nreliable. For example we have checked that the different\noptimum \u03bd for DSC and BSC stripes for a 3-band hamiltonian do not differ from those found for the one-band\nmodel so that we consider this as a robust feature of our\ncalculation.\nIn the present case the more important extrinsic effect\n\n0.06\n0.05\n0.04\n\nRef. 9\nRef. 6\nRef. 7\nRef. 24\ndiagonal SC stripes\ndiagonal BC stripes\n\nZn0.03\nZn0.05\n\n0.03\n0.02\n0.01\n0\n\n0\n\n0.01\n\n0.02\n\n0.03\n\n0.04\n\n0.05\n\n0.06\n\nSr concentration x\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) Doping dependence of the magnetic\nincommensurability \u01eb in the diagonal phase as deduced from\nthe referenced elastic neutron scattering experiments.

For vertical stripes the correlation length can\nreach 150atetra or around 20 times the magnetic stripe\nperiodicity while for diagonal stripes the correlation is of\nthe same order or even smaller than the periodicity[6].\nThis should be kept in mind while comparing with our\nresults which correspond to perfectly ordered stripes arrays. Fig. 2 compares the doping dependence of the magnetic incommensurability \u01eb in the diagonal phase as seen\nin elastic neutron scattering experiments [6, 7, 9, 24] together with the predicted dependence for DSC and DBC\nstripes. For non-codoped samples the experimental incommensurability is in between the theoretical ones for\nDBC and DSC, with a stronger tendency for DBC close\nto the metal-insulator transition which shifts to DSC at\nlow doping. An interesting effect occurs upon substitution of Cu2+ by nonmagnetic Zn2+ which has a filled 3d10\nshell[24]. This should favor DSC stripes which are forced\nto have zero magnetic moments in the core and indeed\nthe incommensurability shift to the computed DSC line\n(c.f. Fig. 2) is in accord with our expectation. All this\nsupggests that the system is made of a disordered mixture of DSC and DBC configurations with a gradual shift\nfrom the former to the latter as doping is increased.\nIn the following we discuss the spin excitations for\ndoping nh = 0.05. For DSC stripes we have \u01eb = 0.05\n(i.e. charged stripes separated by 20a along the x-, or\ny-direction and for DBC stripes with \u01eb = 0.071 (i.e. separated by 14a along x-, or y-direction).

The \u03c9 factor makes visible the high\nenergy features which would appear much faint in the\nexperimentally accessible S(\u03c9, q).

The momentum scale is the distance\nfrom QAF measured in units of 2\u03c0/aortho .\n\nParallel to the stripe the dispersion is dominated by\nmodes very similar to the ones of the undoped AF as\ncould be expected from the real space structure. Due to\nthe large unit cell and the small extension of the reduced\nBrillouin zone in the perpendicular direction excitations\nconsist of a large number of folded bands. These are\ngenerally silent when plotted in the extended Brillouin\nzone but acquire a large spectral weight in proximity to\nthe modes of the parent antiferromagnet (shown with a\ndashed line) giving rise to the horizontal segments in the\nright panel. This is analogous to the effect reported in\nphotoemission where spectral weight is maximized when\nintersecting the free electron dispersion relation[21]. This\nclarifies the evolution of the spectrum at very low doping: As doping decreases the dynamical structure factor\ngradually tends to the one of the antiferromagnet by increasing the number of bands and modulating the spectral weight.\nAt low energies the spectrum is determined by the\nGoldstone excitations belonging to an inwards (i.e. in the\ndirection of [\u03c0, \u03c0]) and an outwards dispersing branch.\nFor DSC stripes upon increasing energy the inwards dispersing branch dominates in weight and reaches the AF\nwave-vector QAF at Ecross \u2248 35meV where it connects\nto the dispersion along the stripe. In contrast to the vertical excitations [14] the saddle-point structure is very\nsmall and barely resolved due to finite size effects. For\nDBC stripes a small gap appears between the Goldstone\nmode and the saddle point in strong resemblance with\nlinear spin-wave theory (LSWT) results by Carlson et al.\n[25].

Interestingly for DSC stripes in our itinerant\napproach the analogous gap is not resolved resulting in\npractice in a continuous dispersion of the Goldstone mode\nup to the saddle with energy Ecross . We expect that in\nboth cases the gap will be washed out by disorder and\ndamping effects.\nIn Fig. 4 we show cuts of the dispersion for the DSC\nstripes. At low frequencies the excitations at the two incommensurate wave-vectors carry the dominant weight\nwhich start to form spin-wave cones upon increasing energy. The cones merge at Ecross = 0.12t where it is apparent that the weight of the cones is strongly anisotropic\nand enhanced close to QAF . Similar to our previous findings for vertical stripes [14, 18] the response well above\nEcross becomes two-dimensional forming a ring shaped\npattern around QAF .\nFig. 5 reports the doping dependence of Ecross for both\nSC (main panel) and BC (lower right panel) textures in\n\n\f4\n100\n\nExperiment\nVBC\nDBC\nDSC\n\nEcross [meV]\n\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n0\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\n0.1\n\n0.12\n\nscattering is compatible with a mixture of SCD and BCD\nstripes.

Since for the undoped system one recovers the spin excitations of the AF, Ecross extrapolates\ndown to zero frequency at nh = 0 (dotted line) for both\nDSC (main panel) and DBC (lower right panel) stripes.\nDue to the large supercells involved we could not access\nthe doping regime nh < 0.04.\nBelow x = 0.08 our computations overestimate Ecross .\nOne should keep in mind that we are working with a\nfixed set of parameters determined in Ref. 14. For example reduction of t improves considerable the agreement\nbut spoils the fitting of the undoped dispersion relation.\nDue to the complexity of the computations we have not\nperformed intense optimization of the parameter set, so\nit may be that for different choices of U and t\u2032 and t\nwe could also achieve a better fit of the overall doping\ndependence. However, we believe the main reason for\nthe disagreement is the strong disorder character of the\nstripes in this doping range. Indeed quite generally one\nexpects a softening of excitations as the magnetic configuration becomes more disordered. This becomes evident\nin the Ising limit comparing the dispersion relation of\nan Ising ferromagnet (or AF) with that of an Ising spin\nglass in which the exchange constant J is the same but\nthe sign is random. In the ordered case the spin flip excitation energy is 2zJ with z the coordination, whereas in\nthe glassy case it is smaller in average due to frustrated\nconfigurations. We have checked for an array of stripes\non a finite cluster that the inclusion of random local impurity potentials leads to a softening of Ecross , whereas\na variation of the stripe spacing induces a broadening of\nthe corresponding excitation.\nTo conclude, we have shown that the doping dependence of the incommensurability of diagonal magnetic\n\nG.S. acknowledges financial support from the Vigoni\nfoundation.\n\n[1] J.
