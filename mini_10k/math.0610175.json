Flores, M. S\u00e1nchez\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the last years, an intensive research on the problem of geodesic connectedness in stationary spacetimes (i.e., the question whether any two points in\na Lorentzian manifold admitting a timelike Killing vector field, can be joined\nby a geodesic) has been carried out. Even though there are geometric and\nphysical reasons - no analog to Hopf\u2013Rinow theorem exists for a Lorentzian\nmanifold, stationary spacetimes include typical physical spacetimes, as Kerr's\nor Schwarzschild's - the main interest comes from the analytical viewpoint.\nIn fact, given a Lorentzian manifold (M, h*, *iL ), geodesics connecting two fixed\npoints p, q \u2208 M are, among the C 1 curves connecting them, the critical points\nof the (energy) action functional\nf (z) =\n\n1\n2\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n1\n\nh\u017c, \u017ciL ds,\n\n(1.1)\n\nwhich becomes strongly indefinite in the Lorentzian setting. Moreover, authors\nhave mainly followed an extrinsic approach based on the assumption that the\nspacetime is standard stationary, i.e. (M, h*, *iL ) splits globally as M = M0 \u00d7\nR, with (M0 , h*, *i) a finite dimensional connected Riemannian manifold, and\nmetric h*, *iL written as\nh*, *iL = h*, *i + 2h\u03b4(x), *idt \u2212 \u03b2(x)dt2\n\n(1.2)\n\nfor each Tz M \u2261 Tx M0 \u00d7 R, z = (x, t) \u2208 M, where \u03b4 and \u03b2 are a smooth vector\nfield and a smooth strictly positive scalar field on M0 , respectively. In this case,\nthe lack of boundedness of f can be overcome by means of a suitable variational\nprinciple, stated in [4, 5, 13], which shows that looking for critical curves of\naction functional f connecting p = (xp , tp ) to q = (xq , tq ) becomes equivalent\nto the study of critical points for a new functional J on the Riemannian part,\nnamely\nJ (x)\n\n=\n\nZ\n1 1 h\u03b4(x), \u1e8bi2\nds\nh\u1e8b, \u1e8bi ds +\n2 0\n\u03b2(x)\n0\n\u0012Z 1\n\u00132 \u0012Z 1\n\u0013\u22121\n1\nh\u03b4(x), \u1e8bi\n1\nds \u2212 \u2206t\nds\n\u2212\n2\n\u03b2(x)\n0\n0 \u03b2(x)\n\n1\n2\n\nZ\n\n1\n\n(1.3)\n\n(\u2206t = tq \u2212 tp ), which is defined on a suitable set of \"spatial\" curves joining xp\nto xq in M0 (for more details, see Proposition 4.1) and may also be bounded\nfrom below.\nSince then, such a functional has been widely studied. Considering only\nthe case h*, *i complete (without boundary), the known main results can be\nsummarized as follows:\n1. Benci, Fortunato and Giannoni [4, 5] studied the geodesic connectedness\nin a standard static spacetime (\u03b4 \u2261 0) and introduced functional J for\nthis case. Giannoni and Masiello [13] extended this study to the standard\n\n\f3\n\nGlobal hyperbolicity and Palais\u2013Smale condition\n\nstationary case. From these results (see also [17, Theorem 3.4.3]), the existence of critical points of J is ensured when \u03b2 and |\u03b4(x)|2 = h\u03b4(x), \u03b4(x)i\nhave an upper bound and some \u01eb \u2208 R exists so that\n0 < \u01eb \u2264 \u03b2(x)\n\nfor all x \u2208 M0 .\n\n(1.4)\n\n2. Pisani [21] used a different approach based on the direct study of action\nfunctional f . He obtained that under assumption (1.4) a sublinear growth\nfor \u03b2 and \u03b4 suffices for the existence of critical points, i.e., it is enough to\nassume that some \u03b1 < 1 exists so that\n\u03b2(x), |\u03b4(x)| \u2264 \u03bcd\u03b1 (x, x\u0304) + k\n\nfor all x \u2208 M0 ,\n\n(1.5)\n\nwhere d(*, *) is the canonical distance associated to h*, *i, x\u0304 \u2208 M0 is fixed,\nand \u03bc \u2265 0, k \u2208 R (see [21, Theorem 1.2] and also [10] for a multiplicity\nresult).\n3. Remarkably, Giannoni and Piccione [14] studied the existence of critical\npoints for action f from a more intrinsic viewpoint. In principle, they\nassume only the existence of a complete timelike Killing vector field K.\n1\nThen, for each p, q \u2208 M, they introduce a natural space of curves CK\n(p, q)\nassociated to K, and consider the restriction of f to this space. Then,\nthey define a notion of pseudo\u2013coercivity for f , and show that, under this\ncondition, p and q can be joined by a geodesic. However, there are two\nimportant limitations on this result: (a) pseudo\u2013coercivity implies global\nhyperbolicity and, thus, the spacetime must be isometric to a standard\nstationary one (see next section), and (b) more unpleasantly, pseudo\u2013\ncoercivity is a very technical analytical condition. So, in order to give a\nmore concrete result, they fix a Cauchy temporal function (which becomes\nequivalent to choose a splitting (1.2)), and reprove Pisani's result (at least\nwhen \u03b2 = \u2212g(K, K) is bounded).\n4. R. Bartolo and the authors [2] have applied very accurate estimates (some\nof them coming from [9]) to functional J in the standard static case, i.e.,\nwhen the functional in (1.3) is simplified by \u03b4 \u2261 0. As a consequence,\nthe exponent \u03b1 = 2 in (1.5) is shown to be enough and optimal for the\nexistence of critical points of J . Recently, Bartolo, Candela and Flores\n[1] have extended this result to the stationary case, showing that it is\nsufficient to assume\n0 < \u03b2(x)\n|\u03b4(x)|\n\n\u2264\n\n\u2264\n\n\u03bc1 d2 (x, x\u0304) + k1\n\u03bc2 d(x, x\u0304) + k2\n\nfor all x \u2208 M0 ,\n\nfor all x \u2208 M0\n\n(1.6)\n(1.7)\n\n(with x\u0304 \u2208 M0 fixed, and \u03bc1 , \u03bc2 \u2265 0, k1 , k2 \u2208 R). We must emphasize that\nthese hypotheses correspond to the rough bounds in order to ensure the\nglobal hyperbolicity of the spacetime (see Appendix A.1).\n\n\f4\n\nA.M. Candela, J.L. Flores, M. S\u00e1nchez\n\nThe study of the standard stationary case hides an important fact: the same\nspacetime can split as (1.2) in very different ways (with very different \u03b2, \u03b4)\nbecause just one such splitting is not intrinsic to the spacetime. As a simple\nand extreme example, Minkowski spacetime can be written as (1.2) either with\nan arbitrary growth of |\u03b4| or with an incomplete h*, *i (see Appendix A.2). More\ndeeply, the bounds for \u03b2, |\u03b4| do not have a geometric meaning on M, except as\nsufficient (but neither necessary nor intrinsic) conditions for global hyperbolicity.\nMotivated by this type of objections, here we focus on Giannoni and Piccione's approach. The main limitation of their results is that pseudo\u2013coercivity\ncondition is analytical and very technical. In fact, it can be regarded as a tidy\nand neat version of Palais\u2013Smale condition for the stationary ambient. But\nnow the question is how to translate this technical condition in terms of the\n(Lorentzian) geometry of the manifold.\nThe aim of this paper is to answer this question by showing that, essentially,\nthe geometrical meaning of pseudo\u2013coercivity is global hyperbolicity with a complete Cauchy hypersurface. In fact, we prove the following result (which extends\nall the previous ones), discussing carefully all the hypotheses:\nTheorem 1.1 Let (M, h*, *iL ) be a stationary spacetime with a complete timelike Killing vector field K. If M is globally hyperbolic with a complete (smooth,\nspacelike) Cauchy hypersurface S, then it is geodesically connected.\nEven more, well\u2013known standard arguments in previous references (based on\nLjusternik\u2013Schnirelman category) allow one to prove also some multiplicity results when M is not contractible in itself. Concretely: (i) each two points\np, q \u2208 M can be joined by a sequence of spacelike geodesics (zn )n with diverging (f (zn ))n , (ii) given p \u2208 M and an integral curve \u03b3 of K, the number of\n(future-directed) timelike geodesics which connect p and \u03b3(s), diverges when\ns \u2192 +\u221e.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we introduce the necessary\nLorentzian tools, emphasizing the interplay between stationarity and global hyperbolicity. In Section 3 Giannoni\u2013Piccione's intrinsic approach is revisited, and\nthe relevant aspects for our problem are stressed. As the hypotheses of Theorem\n1.1 will imply the existence of a splitting as in (1.2), in Section 4 we explain how\nthe functional approach is simplified when one chooses one such splitting (but\nthe results will be independent of the chosen one). The proof of Theorem 1.1\nis carried out in Section 5. Previous discussion translates it into Theorem 5.1,\nand the crucial step for its proof is Proposition 5.2. Essentially, this proposition\nshows that, because of the existence of a complete Cauchy hypersurface, one\nmust check Palais\u2013Smale condition only for sequences of curves with bounded\nRiemannian norm. In the Appendix A we give exhaustive examples and discussions which show the accuracy of Theorem 1.1 and explain the meaning of\nthe involved hypotheses. In general, we try to minimize the technicalities in\nthe interplay between Causality Theory and Variational Methods (see Remark\n3.3). Nevertheless, one of these technicalities, which regards the relation between continuous and H 1 causal curves is interesting in its own right, and is\nstudied in Appendix B.\n\n\fGlobal hyperbolicity and Palais\u2013Smale condition\n\n2\n\n5\n\nTools in Lorentzian Geometry\n\nIn this section we briefly recall some basic notions in Lorentzian Geometry\nwhich will be used along the paper (for more details on Lorentzian manifolds,\nsee [3, 15, 19, 20, 23]).\nBy a Lorentzian manifold (M, h*, *iL ) we mean a smooth1 (connected) finite\ndimensional manifold equipped with a semi\u2013Riemannian metric of index 1 on\neach tangent space Tz M, z \u2208 M. A tangent vector \u03b6 \u2208 Tz M is called timelike\n(respectively lightlike; spacelike; causal) if h\u03b6, \u03b6iL < 0 (respectively h\u03b6, \u03b6iL = 0\nand \u03b6 6= 0; h\u03b6, \u03b6iL > 0 or \u03b6 = 0; \u03b6 is either timelike or lightlike). In what\nfollows the Lorentzian manifold (M, h*, *iL ) will be also a spacetime, that is,\n(M, h*, *iL ) is connected and time\u2013orientable, with a prescribed time\u2013orientation\n(a continuous choice of a causal cone at each p \u2208 M, which is called the future\ncone, in opposition to the non\u2013chosen one or past cone).\nA C 1 curve \u03b3 : I \u2192 M (I real interval) is called timelike, lightlike, spacelike\nor causal when so it is \u03b3\u0307(s) for all s \u2208 I. For causal curves, this definition is\nextended to include piecewise C 1 curves: in this case, the two limit tangent\nvectors on the breaks must belong to the same causal cone. Accordingly, causal\ncurves are called either future or past directed depending on the cone of \u03b3\u0307(s).\nA smooth curve \u03b3 : I \u2192 M is a geodesic if its acceleration vanishes, i.e.,\n\u2207L\ns \u03b3\u0307(s) = 0\n\nfor all s \u2208 I,\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere \u2207L\ns denotes the covariant derivative along \u03b3 induced by the Levi\u2013Civita\nconnection of metric h*, *iL . In this case, the product\nE\u03b3 \u2261 h\u03b3\u0307(s), \u03b3\u0307(s)iL\n\nfor all s \u2208 I\n\nis necessarily constant. The spacetime (M, h*, *iL ) is geodesically connected if,\ngiven any two points p, q \u2208 M, there exists a geodesic z \u2217 : [0, 1] \u2192 M such\nthat z \u2217 (0) = p and z \u2217 (1) = q. This property is equivalent to the existence of\na critical point of the action functional defined in (1.1) in the set of all the C 1\ncurves z : [0, 1] \u2192 M such that z(0) = p and z(1) = q (and also in the extended\ndomain of H 1 curves below).\nA vector field K in (M, h*, *iL ) is said complete if its integral curves are\ndefined on the whole real line. On the other hand, K is said Killing if the Lie\nderivative of the metric tensor h*, *iL with respect to K vanishes everywhere,\nor, equivalently, if the stages of all its local flows are isometries (i.e., h*, *iL is\ninvariant by its flow).\nA well\u2013known characterization of Killing vector fields is the following: K is\na Killing vector field if and only if for each pair Y , W of vector fields, it is\nL\nh\u2207L\nY K, W iL = \u2212 h\u2207W K, Y iL .\n\n1 As a simplification, smooth will mean C \u221e as usual. But this hypothesis can be relaxed.\nIn fact, one can assume that smooth means only C 4 for the spacetime and, consequently, C 3\nfor the elements which depend on first derivatives, as hypersurfaces. This allows one to apply\nNash Embedding Theorem (in the spirit of most previous references on this topic) to some\nhypersurfaces, and no new problem will appear in our case, because the existence of smooth\nCauchy hypersurfaces has been proved in [6] (see discussion below).\n\n\f6\n\nA.M. Candela, J.L. Flores, M. S\u00e1nchez\n\nThus, if z : I \u2192 M is a C 1 curve and K is a Killing vector field it is\nh\u017c, \u2207L\ns K(z)iL \u2261 0\non I. If z is only absolutely continuous, this holds almost everywhere in I. In\nparticular, if z is a geodesic this property implies the existence of a constant\nCz \u2208 R such that\n(2.2)\nh\u017c, K(z)iL \u2261 Cz for all s \u2208 I.\nA spacetime is called stationary if it admits a timelike Killing vector field\nK. Locally, any stationary spacetime looks like a standard stationary one, i.e.,\nthe spacetime in (1.2). For these spacetimes, without loss of generality it can\nbe assumed K = \u2202t so to define the (future) time\u2013orientation. If, in addition,\nK is also irrotational (i.e., its orthogonal distribution K \u22a5 is involutive), the\nstationary spacetime is called static; in this case, locally it looks like a standard\nstatic one (i.e., its spacetime metric is the product one obtained in (1.2) with\n\u03b4 \u2261 0). Notice that a static spacetime may be standard stationary but not\nstandard static (see Remark 2.4 below).\nGiven p, q \u2208 M the causality relation p < q (respectively chronological relation\np \u226a q) means that there exists a future\u2013directed causal (respectively timelike)\ncurve from p to q. Denote by p \u2264 q indistinctly either p < q or p = q. Then, for\neach p \u2208 M the causal future J + (p) and the causal past J \u2212 (p) are defined as\nJ + (p) = {q \u2208 M : p \u2264 q}\n\nand\n\nJ \u2212 (p) = {q \u2208 M : q \u2264 p}.\n\nTaking into account these relations, the space of piecewise C 1 causal curves can\nbe extended in a way appropriate for convergence of curves (cf. [12, pp. 442] or\nalso [3, pp. 54]):\nDefinition 2.1 A (non\u2013necessarily smooth) future-directed causal curve \u03b3 :\nI \u2192 M is a (continuous) curve which, for each convex2 neighbourhood U ,\nsatisfies that, given t, t\u2032 \u2208 I, t < t\u2032 with \u03b3([t, t\u2032 ]) \u2282 U , necessarily \u03b3(t) <U \u03b3(t\u2032 ),\nwhere <U is the causal relation in U , regarded as a spacetime (i.e., \u03b3(t) and\n\u03b3(t\u2032 ) can be joined by a future\u2013directed C 1 \u2013causal curve contained entirely in\nU ).\nRemark 2.2 Causal curves, even if non\u2013necessarily smooth, must be at least\nlocally Lipschitzian and, thus, a.e. differentiable with finite integral of their\nlength (see [20, Remark 2.26]). Notice that a continuous curve, a.e. differentiable, with timelike gradient (in the same time\u2013orientation at each differentiable\npoint) and finite integral of its length, is not necessarily a causal curve. A counterexample in Lorentz\u2013Minkowski spacetime L2 can be constructed as follows.\nConsider a \"devil's staircase\" type function t \u2208 [0, 1] 7\u2192 x(t) \u2208 R (the typical\nexample is Cantor's function) which is continuous, with 0 derivative a.e., and\nconnects x(0) = 0, x(1) = 2. Now, the curve in natural coordinates of L2 ,\n2 i.e.,\n\nU is a (starshaped) normal neighbourhood of all its points (see [19, pp. 129]).\n\n\fGlobal hyperbolicity and Palais\u2013Smale condition\n\n7\n\n\u03b3(t) = (x(t), t), satisfies all the required properties, but it connects the non\u2013\ncausally related points (0, 0), (2, 1).\nRecall also that causal curves are absolutely continuous and, thus, they lie in\nthe spaces of H 1 type defined below.\nThere are some equivalent definitions on what means to be globally hyperbolic for a spacetime:\n(1) The spacetime is strongly causal (i.e., no \"almost\u2013closed\" causal curves\nexist) and J + (p) \u2229 J \u2212 (q) is compact for any p, q \u2208 M. Even more, it\nis worth pointing out that the assumption of being strongly causal can\nbe weakened in only causal (absence of closed causal curves, see [18] for\ndetailed explanations).\n(2) The space of causal curves joining any two fixed points p, q \u2208 M (defined from [0, 1] to M, but identified up to a strictly increasing monotonic\nreparametrization) is compact. The definition of the topology in such\nspace of causal curves is somewhat subtle (see [16, 20]). Essentially, a\npriori we will exclude the existence of closed causal curves (otherwise,\nparametrizing one such a curve by giving more and more rounds, a sequence of non\u2013equivalent causal curves would be obtained, and the compactness of the space of causal curves would be violated) and, then, the\nC 0 topology of curves is used.\n(3) There exists a Cauchy hypersurface, that is, a subset which is crossed\nexactly once by any inextendible timelike curve.\nA Cauchy hypersurface is necessarily a closed subset of M and an embedded\ntopological hypersurface. A long\u2013standing folk question has been if any globally\nhyperbolic spacetime must also admit a smooth Cauchy hypersurface which is\nspacelike (at all its points). Recently, this question has been answered affirmatively in [6] and, thus, we can take as a characterization of global hyperbolicity\nthe existence of a (smooth) spacelike Cauchy hypersurface S \u2282 M. This characterization has the following remarkable consequence for stationary spacetimes:\nTheorem 2.3 A globally hyperbolic stationary spacetime is a standard stationary one, if some of its timelike Killing vector fields K is complete.\nProof. Let S be a spacelike Cauchy hypersurface, and consider the map\n\u03a8 : (x, t) \u2208 S \u00d7 R 7\u2192 \u03a6t (x) \u2208 M,\nwhere \u03a6 is the flow of the complete vector field K. As each point of M is\ncrossed by one integral curve of K, which crosses S at exactly one point, \u03a8 is a\ndiffeomorphism. As K is Killing, the pull\u2013back metric \u03a8\u2217 h*, *iL is independent\nof t and, thus, it makes S \u00d7 R be a standard stationary spacetime.\n\n\f8\n\nA.M. Candela, J.L. Flores, M. S\u00e1nchez\n\nRemark 2.4 (1) If K is also irrotational, Theorem 2.3 does not yield the standard static splitting, as an integral manifold of K \u22a5 may be non\u2013Cauchy. A\ncounterexample would be\nM = S 1 \u00d7 R,\n\nh*, *iL = d\u03b82 + 2dtd\u03b8 \u2212 dt2 ,\n\nwhere (S 1 , d\u03b82 ) is the standard unit circumference, and K = \u2202t .\n(2) Function t on M obtained from \u03a8\u22121 is a Cauchy temporal function, that\nis, the levels t = constant are Cauchy hypersurfaces, and t is smooth with a past\u2013\ndirected timelike gradient (in particular, t is a time function, i.e. a continuous\nfunction which increases on any future\u2013directed causal curve). As proved in [7],\nwhen such a temporal function exists the spacetime admits a global orthogonal\nsplitting as in (1.2) with \u03b4 \u2261 0 but with \u03b2 and h*, *i depending on t. This splitting\nis obtained by flowing through the integral curves of \u2207t (which, of course, are\nnot equal to the integral curves of K \u2261 \u2202t in general) and, thus, it has a different\nnature from the splitting in Theorem 2.3.\n(3) Under the hypotheses of Theorem 1.1, S can be chosen complete and,\nthus, so it is h*, *i in the splitting (1.2).\nFinally, the following well\u2013known property of globally hyperbolic spacetimes is\nstated for reference below (see, for example, [15, Proposition 6.6.6]):\nProposition 2.5 If M admits a Cauchy hypersurface S then J \u2212 (p) \u2229 S is\ncompact, for any p \u2208 M.\n\n3\n\nAbstract intrinsic functional framework\n\nThroughout this section we will assume that (M, h*, *iL ) is a finite dimensional\nstationary spacetime with Killing vector field K. Next, geodesic connectedness of (M, h*, *iL ) will be studied by using an intrinsic approach and, so, the\nframework introduced by Giannoni and Piccione in [14] is revisited.\nIn order to define notions as uniform convergence of curves or H 1 spaces, fix\nany auxiliary Riemannian metric h*, *iR on M. This metric can be chosen by\nleaving h*, *iL unaltered on the orthogonal bundle of K, and reversing the sign\non K, explicitly:\nh\u03b6, \u03b6 \u2032 iR = h\u03b6, \u03b6 \u2032 iL \u2212 2\n\nh\u03b6, K(z)iL h\u03b6 \u2032 , K(z)iL\nhK(z), K(z)iL\n\n(3.1)\n\nfor all \u03b6, \u03b6 \u2032 \u2208 Tz M, z \u2208 M (this is the canonical choice in [14]). But recall\nthat, on a standard stationary spacetime, i.e., when M is equipped with metric\n(1.2), metric (3.1) does not agree with h*, *i on M0 , and may be incomplete on\nM. Nevertheless, the results on this section are independent of the particular\nchoice of h*, *iR .\nAs noticed in the previous section, the conservation law (2.2) is a natural\nconstraint for geodesics in stationary spacetimes. Therefore, it results natural\n\n\f9\n\nGlobal hyperbolicity and Palais\u2013Smale condition\n\nto look for critical points of action functional f in (1.1) defined on the set of\ncurves\n1\nCK\n(p, q) = {z \u2208 C 1 ([0, 1], M) : z(0) = p, z(1) = q, and Cz \u2208 R exists\nsuch that h\u017c, K(z)iL \u2261 Cz }.\n\nAs a first variational principle, we have (see [14, pp. 2]3 ):\n1\n1\nTheorem 3.1 If z \u2208 CK\n(p, q) is a critical point of f restricted to CK\n(p, q) then\nz is a geodesic connecting p and q.\n1\nEven if functional f is defined in CK\n(p, q), it cannot be managed only in\nthis space, as this space is \"too small\" for problems of convergence. So, the\n\"natural\" setting of this variational problem is a suitable submanifold of the\nspace of H 1 curves from [0, 1] to M, named H 1 ([0, 1], M).\nThus, we define the infinite dimensional manifold\n\n\u03a91 (p, q) = {z : [0, 1] \u2192 M : z is absolutely continuous and such that\nZ 1\nz(0) = p, z(1) = q,\nh\u017c, \u017ciR ds < +\u221e},\n0\n\n1\n\nwhose tangent space in each z \u2208 \u03a9 (p, q) can be identified with\nTz \u03a91 (p, q) =\n\n{\u03b6 : [0, 1] \u2192 T M : \u03b6(s) \u2208 Tz(s) M for all s \u2208 [0, 1], \u03b6 is\nabsolutely continuous and \u03b6(0) = 0 = \u03b6(1), k\u03b6k\u2217 < +\u221e},\n\nbeing its Hilbert norm\nk\u03b6k2\u2217 =\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n1\n\nR\nh\u2207R\ns \u03b6, \u2207s \u03b6iR ds,\n\nwhere \u2207R\ns denotes the covariant derivative along z relative to metric tensor h*, *iR\n(nevertheless, we are not interested in its concrete value, which depends on the\nchosen h*, *iR , but only in the finiteness of the norm). Recall that functional\nf in (1.1) is well defined and finite on all \u03a91 (p, q) (for example, notice that,\nfor the choice (3.1) of h*, *iR , h\u03b6, \u03b6iR \u2265 |h\u03b6, \u03b6iL |).

Standard calculations allow one to prove\nthat the critical points in \u03a91 (p, q) are smooth curves which satisfy geodesic\nequation (2.1).\n1\nAnalogously, the set CK\n(p, q) can be extended to a new subset of \u03a91 (p, q)\ndefined as\n\u03a91K (p, q) = {z \u2208 \u03a91 (p, q) : Cz \u2208 R exists such that\nh\u017c, K(z)iL = Cz a.e. on [0, 1]}.\n\n(3.2)\n\n3 In [14, pp. 2] this results is actually stated for C 1 curves (not necessarily in C 1 (p, q)).

For simplicity, denote the restriction of action functional f on \u03a91K (p, q) still with f . Thus, the following variational principle can\nbe stated (for a complete proof, see [14, Theorem 3.3]).\nTheorem 3.2 A curve z \u2208 \u03a91 (p, q) is a geodesic in M if and only if z \u2208\n\u03a91K (p, q) and z is a critical point of functional f in \u03a91K (p, q).\nRemark 3.3 An essential step in the proof of Theorem 1.1 will be to construct\ncausal curves from certain curves which connect two fixed points. If these curves\nbelong to a general H 1 \u2013space, then we should extend the notion of C 1 causal\ncurve to H 1 ones. When one makes this extension some subtleties appear (recall\nRemark 2.2), and the space of causal curves is reobtained (see Appendix B).\nNevertheless, we will skip such technicalities by using sequences of curves in\n1\nCK\n(p, q) and their limits in \u03a91K (p, q) \u2282 \u03a91 (p, q).\nNow, let us introduce the following definition which, essentially, translates\nclassical \"condition (C) of Palais\u2013Smale\" to our ambient.\nDefinition 3.4 Fixed c \u2208 R the set \u03a91K (p, q) is c\u2013precompact for f if every sequence (zn )n \u2282 \u03a91K (p, q) with f (zn ) \u2264 c has a subsequence which converges weakly in \u03a91 (p, q) (hence, uniformly in M). Furthermore, the restriction of f to \u03a91K (p, q) is pseudo\u2013coercive if \u03a91K (p, q) is c\u2013precompact for all\nc \u2265 inf f (\u03a91K (p, q)).\nThe geodesic connectivity between each p and q will be a consequence of the\nfollowing theorem (see [14, Theorem 1.2]).\n1\n1\nTheorem 3.5 If CK\n(p, q) is not empty and there exists c > inf f (CK\n(p, q)) such\n1\nthat CK (p, q) is c\u2013precompact then there exists at least one geodesic joining p to\nq in M.\n\n1\nThe assumption CK\n(p, q) non\u2013empty must be imposed, because even if the\nstationary spacetime is globally hyperbolic it may not hold (see Appendix A.3\n1\n(a) for an explicit counterexample). Nevertheless, the possibility of CK\n(p, q) = \u2205\ncan be ruled out if K is complete (compare with [14, Lemma 5.7]).\n\nProposition 3.6 Under the hypotheses of Theorem 2.3, for each p, q \u2208 M, it\n1\nis CK\n(p, q) 6= \u2205.\n\nProof.

Let us remark that, in what follows, the hypotheses of\nTheorem 1.1 are always assumed, as well as the standard stationary splitting\nassociated to the complete K and S, and the notations\nR 1 introduced in Sections 3\nand 4. In particular, for any curve x in S, k\u1e8bk2 = 0 h\u1e8b, \u1e8bids, where the metric\nh*, *i is just the induced Riemannian metric on S.\n1\nProposition 5.2 Let (zn )n , zn = (xn , tn ), be a sequence of curves in CK\n(p, q)\nsuch that f (zn )(= J (xn )) is upper bounded for all n. Then, (k\u1e8bn k)n is bounded,\ntoo.\n\nNow, let us state some lemmas useful in the proof of Proposition 5.2 in\nwhich, for simplicity, we define C 1 (xp , xq ; S) = \u03a91 (xp , xq ; S) \u2229 C 1 ([0, 1], M).\nFirstly, let us point out that when the xn 's lie in a compact subset of S,\nProposition 5.2 is just a consequence of Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality.\nLemma 5.3 Let (xn )n \u2282 C 1 (xp , xq ; S). If a compact subset C of S contains all\nthe elements of the sequence (xn )n and k\u1e8bn k \u2192 +\u221e, then J (xn ) \u2192 +\u221e.\nProof. Consider definition (1.3).

But first notice that, given the\nspacelike parts (xn )n , a sequence of future\u2013directed lightlike curves from p =\n(xp , tp ) to the integral curve of K through q = (xq , tq ) can be constructed. More\nprecisely:\nLemma 5.4 Fixed any x \u2208 C 1 (xp , xq ; S) (x non\u2013constant if xp = xq ) there\nexists a unique lightlike curve \u03b3 l = (xl , tl ) : [0, 1] \u2192 M joining (xp , tp ) to\n{xq } \u00d7 R in a time T (x) = tl (1) \u2212 tl (0) > 0 such that xl = x.

Fixing x \u2208 C 1 (xp , xq ; S), the tl part of the curve \u03b3 l = (x, tl ) : [0, 1] \u2192 M\nis characterized by the equalities h\u03b3\u0307 l , \u03b3\u0307 l iL = 0, tl (0) = tp and the inequality\n\u1e6bl > 0 a.e. on [0,1].

The second one is just a simple consequence of the completeness\nof S, but this property also turns out to be essential.\nLemma 5.5 Let (xn )n \u2282 C 1 (xp , xq ; S) and, for each n \u2208 N, denote Tn =\nT (xn ). If no compact subset of S contains all the elements of sequence (xn )n ,\nthen, up to a subsequence, it is:\n(i) Tn \u2192 +\u221e, and\n(ii) k\u1e8bn k \u2192 +\u221e.\nProof. (i) Arguing by contradiction, let T + be an upper bound for all Tn , and\nput p = (xp , tp ), q + = (xq , T + ). The lightlike curves \u03b3nl = (xn , tln ) obtained\nfrom Lemma 5.4, can be prolongued with the integral curve of K from (xq , Tn )\nto (xq , T + ); so, a piecewise smooth future\u2013directed causal curve from p to q +\nis obtained and all the \u03b3nl lie in J \u2212 (q + ). By Proposition 2.5, J \u2212 (q + ) \u2229 S is\ncompact, but this is a contradiction because this subset contains all the xn 's.\n(ii) As S is complete, no bounded subset can contain all the xn 's. So, there is a\nsequence of points (xn (sn ))n at arbitrary large distance from xp , and the result\nfollows.\n\n\f15\n\nGlobal hyperbolicity and Palais\u2013Smale condition\n\nLemma 5.6 Fixed any sequence (xn )n \u2282 C 1 (xp , xq ; S) such that\nk\u1e8bn k \u2192 +\u221e\n\nand\n\nTn \u2192 +\u221e\n\n(5.4)\n\nthen\nJ (xn ) \u2192 +\u221e.\n\n(5.5)\n\nProof.

As S is complete, then x \u2208\n\u03a91 (xp , xq ; S), and all the xn 's lie in a compact subset. Thus, (5.2) holds, and,\nby (4.4) and Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality, sequence (Cn )n has to be bounded.\nHence, (4.3) and, again, Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality imply that (tn )n is bounded\nin H 1 ([0, 1], R) too, and thus, t \u2208 W (tp , tq ) exists so that tn \u2192 t uniformly in\n[0,1] (up to subsequences).\n\nAppendix A: Discussion on the hypotheses and\nsome counterexamples\n\u00a71. Estimates for the global hyperbolicity of a standard stationary\nspacetime. As proven in [24], the spacetime (1.2) is globally hyperbolic if h*, *i\nis complete, \u03b2 is at most quadratic and \u03b4 at most linear, that is (1.6) and (1.7)\nhold. This is a \"rough estimate\": it is easy to find counterexamples when the\nexponent of d in any of the inequalities is increased a bit, but these inequalities\nare only sufficient conditions. In fact, in the standard static case \u03b4 \u2261 0, the\nspacetime is globally hyperbolic if and only if the conformal metric\nh*, *i\u2217 =\n\nh*, *i\n\u03b2(x)\n\n(5.9)\n\nis complete (see [25] for more details). Notice that it is not relevant for h*, *i to be\ncomplete or not. In fact, classical Schwarzschild spacetime is globally hyperbolic\nwith incomplete h*, *i. Nevertheless, when a standard static spacetime is globally\nhyperbolic the slices at constant t are Cauchy hypersurfaces. Moreover, such\na spacetime admits a complete spacelike Cauchy hypersurface S if and only if\n\n\fGlobal hyperbolicity and Palais\u2013Smale condition\n\n17\n\nh*, *i is complete (the non\u2013trivial implication to the right can be proven because\nthe projection S \u2192 M0 is a diffeomorphism which increases the distances).\n\u00a72. Arbitrariness of standard stationary splittings. As explained in the\nIntroduction, essentially all the previous results in the literature on geodesic\nconnectedness of stationary spacetimes rely in the behaviour of h*, *i, \u03b2, \u03b4. Nevertheless, these elements are not canonical for the spacetime, in the sense that\nmany such splittings are possible with a very different behavior for them. For example, L2 can be written as R2 endowed with the metric dx2 +2\u03b4\u0304(x)dxdt\u2212dt2 for\nany function \u03b4\u0304. This can be checked because the spacetime is a flat spaceform,\ni.e., its Gauss curvature is 0, it is simply connected and geodesically complete.\nThe last property follows because, as a consequence of [22, Proposition 2.1],\none has just to prove that the metric h*, *iR in (3.1) is complete. But this is\nstraightforward because, in the natural coordinates, the matrix of this metric\nhas eigenvalues greater than a positive constant (see also [22, Example 2.4]).\nThus, vector field \u03b4 = \u03b4\u0304\u2202x may not satisfy the (at most) linear condition (1.7)\nabove. Even more, it is also easy to construct incomplete Cauchy hypersurfaces\nin L2 and, then, by using the natural Killing vector field K = \u2202t , Theorem 2.3\nyields a stationary splitting with incomplete h*, *i.\n\u00a73. Accuracy of the hypotheses of Theorem 1.1. Let us check this with\ntwo counterexamples:\n(a) Stationary + Globally hyperbolic with complete S 6\u21d2 geodesically connected. Consider the spacetime obtained by removing in Lorentz\u2013Minkowski Ln+1 , n \u2265 1, the causal future of the points with x1 = 0 = t, in natural\ncoordinates (x1 , . . . , xn , t). Clearly, the spacetime admits the hyperplane\nt \u2261 \u22121 as a complete Cauchy hypersurface, but it is not geodesically\n1\nconnected. Moreover, CK\n(p, q) = \u2205 for p = (\u22121, 0, . . . , 0), q = (1, 0, . . . , 0).\n(b) Stationary with complete K + Globally hyperbolic 6\u21d2 geodesically connected. Let (S, h*, *i) be a non\u2013geodesically connected Riemannian manifold. Take \u03b2 such that h*, *i\u2217 in (5.9) is complete. Then, the standard static\nspacetime (S \u00d7 R, h*, *i \u2212 \u03b2(x)dt2 ) is globally hyperbolic and not geodesically connected, because the slice t = 0 is totally geodesic (the family of\nstatic spacetimes given in [2, Section 7] also stresses the importance of\nglobal hyperbolicity).\n\u00a74. Accuracy of pseudo\u2013coercivity from a technical viewpoint. As\n1\nshown in Theorem 3.5, pseudo\u2013coercivity of functional f (on CK\n(p, q) for all\np, q \u2208 M) yields a technical natural condition for the geodesic connectedness\nof the spacetime. Let us discuss the relation between this condition and others\ninvolved in Theorem 1.1 as well as in [14]. Along this discussion, (M, h*, *iL )\nis a stationary spacetime with a given timelike Killing vector field K, and we\nemphasize that, in the point (c), the Riemannian metric h*, *iR on M will be\nchosen as the one associated to h*, *iL and K by formula (3.1).\n(a) Functional f pseudo\u2013coercive \u21d2 M globally hyperbolic (and, thus, the\nspacetime admits a splitting as standard stationary if K is complete). A\n\n\f18\n\nA.M. Candela, J.L. Flores, M. S\u00e1nchez\n\nproof (valid in the case K complete) can be seen in [14, Proposition B.1].\nAn alternative argument based on the definitions of global hyperbolicity\nin Section 2 is the following. Arguing by contradiction, if the space of\ncausal curves joining two points p \u2264 q is not compact, then there exists\na sequence (zn )n of such future\u2013directed causal curves with no converging subsequence. As each zn can be approximated by piecewise smooth\nlightlike curves, we can assume that the zn 's are in fact lightlike curves.\nThus, f (zn ) = 0 for any reparametrization of zn . As h\u017cn , K(z)iL < 0, we\ncan choose this reparametrization (and smooth the possible finite number\n1\nof breaks of zn ) in order to make zn to belong to CK\n(p, q) with bounded\nf (zn ). So, a converging subsequence of (zn )n has to exist, which yields\nthe contradiction.\nEven more, if M is standard static then the pseudo\u2013coercivity also implies h*, *i complete (notice that this does not hold in the stationary case,\nas explained at the end of \u00a72). In fact, otherwise an incomplete geodesic\nx : [0, 1) \u2192 M0 exists. The curve in M, z = (x, 0) will be a geodesic too,\nwith Cz = 0. Now, consider the sequence of curves zn = (xn , 0), where\neach xn is a loop obtained by reparametrizing the restriction x|[0,1\u22121/n]\nin such a way that p = x(0) = xn (0) = xn (1), xn (1/2) = x(1 \u2212 1/n) for\nall n > 1. Again, Czn = 0, and (zn )n violates the pseudo\u2013coercivity of\n1\nCK\n(p, p).\n(b) Functional f pseudo\u2013coercive 6\u21d2 K complete. A simple counterexample is\nany strip M0 \u00d7 (a, b), (a, b) R of any standard static spacetime M =\nM0 \u00d7 R with a complete Cauchy hypersurface (for example, M = Ln ).\nIn fact, f is pseudo\u2013coercive for the full M (from the proof of Theorem\n1\n1.1), and the strip is still pseudo\u2013coercive, as any curve (x, t) \u2208 CK\n(p, q)\nhas t either non\u2013decreasing or non\u2013increasing.\nNevertheless, recall that this is the unique example in the standard static\ncase, and it does not yield new interesting examples in the stationary one.\n1\nIn fact, in the stationary case, when there exists a curve (x, t) \u2208 CK\n(p, q)\n(for example, a geodesic) such that t admits either a strict maximum or\nminimum, then no strip M0 \u00d7 (a, b) with \u2212\u221e < a < b < +\u221e is pseudo\u2013\ncoercive.\n(c) Functional f pseudo\u2013coercive + K complete \u21d2 h*, *iR in (3.1) complete\n(in particular, h*, *iR will be complete under the hypotheses of Theorem\n1.1). From the final discussion in (a), the result is obvious in the standard\nstatic case, because then h*, *i becomes complete and h*, *iR becomes the\nRiemannian warped product h*, *iR = h*, *i + \u03b2(x)dt2 , which is complete,\ntoo (see [19, Lemma 7.40]). For the general case, choose any incomplete\nh*, *iR \u2013geodesic \u03b3 : I \u2192 M and consider the map \u03c8 : I \u00d7 R \u2192 M,\n(s, t) 7\u2192 \u03a6t (\u03b3(s)), where \u03a6 denotes the flow of K. Then, I \u00d7 R, with the\ninduced metric \u03c8 \u2217 h*, *iL , is static (\u2202t is a timelike Killing vector field and,\nin dimension 2, any such vector field is irrotational). Moreover, \u03c8 \u2217 h*, *iR\ncoincides with the Riemannian metric on I \u00d7R obtained from \u03c8 \u2217 h*, *iL and\n\u2202t in (3.1). Recall also that f becomes pseudo\u2013coercive for this spacetime;\n\n\fGlobal hyperbolicity and Palais\u2013Smale condition\n\n19\n\nthus, I \u00d7R becomes globally hyperbolic and (as I \u00d7R is 2\u2013dimensional and\nsimply connected) standard static. But, then, the standard static case is\napplicable, and the metric \u03c8 \u2217 h*, *iR must be complete, a contradiction.\nIt is worth pointing out that the completeness of h*, *iR implies the completeness of K (if an integral curve of K escapes any compact subset, it must\nhave infinite length by the completeness of h*, *iR and will be complete as it\nhas constant h*, *iR \u2013speed). Nevertheless, the completeness of h*, *iR and global\nhyperbolicity are independent: any compact stationary spacetime is a counterexample for the implication to the right, and Schwarzschild spacetime is a\ncounterexample for the converse.\nFinally, we can wonder if both conditions together, the completeness of h*, *iR\nand the global hyperbolicity of M, would imply the existence of a complete\nCauchy hypersurface (and, thus, geodesic connectedness, by Theorem 1.1). Nevertheless, this type of questions involves completely different techniques (see, for\nexample, [8]) and goes beyond the scope of the present article.\n\nAppendix B: H 1 causal curves are causal curves\nThe most general notion of causal curve is the one for continuous curves (see\nDefinition 2.1). Necessarily, such a causal curve is H 1 (see Remark 2.2) with\na.e. causal gradient, in the same time\u2013orientation. Now, our purpose is to prove\nthe converse, which becomes natural when properties of completeness of the set\nof causal curves are considered (see Remark 3.3). In the proof, the absolute\ncontinuity of H 1 curves will be essential (recall the Cantor\u2013type counterexample\nin Remark 2.2). So, our final result can be stated as follows.\nTheorem 5.7 Let (M, h*, *iL ) be a spacetime, and \u03b3 : [0, 1] \u2192 M, I = [0, 1], a\ncontinuous curve. Then, the following items are equivalent:\n(i) \u03b3 is future\u2013directed causal (according to Definition 2.1);\n(ii) \u03b3 is H 1 and \u03b3\u0307(s) is a future\u2013directed causal vector for a.e. s \u2208 I.\nProof. According to Remark 2.2, we have only to prove that (ii) \u21d2 (i). Thus,\ntaken \u03b3 so that (ii) holds, it is enough to show that, chosen any s0 \u2208 I and\nany convex neighborhood U of z0 = \u03b3(s0 ), there exists 0 < \u03b4 < 1 such that if\n0 < s1 \u2212 s0 < \u03b4 then z0 <U z1 = \u03b3(s1 ).\nFirstly, notice that, in a neighbourhood V \u2286 U of z0 , the spacetime can be\nwritten as S \u00d7 (t\u2212 , t+ ) with\nh*, *iL [x, t] = gt [x] \u2212 dt2 ,\n\nwhere gt is a Riemannian metric on S for any t \u2208 (t\u2212 , t+ ) and \u2202t is future\u2013\ndirected (for example, see [20, pp. 53]). Then, we can choose \u03b4 > 0 such that\n\u03b3([s0 , s0 + \u03b4]) \u2282 V .\nPut zi = (xi , ti ), i = 0, 1. Clearly, it is z0 <U z1 if there exists a C 1 curve\ny : t \u2208 [t0 , t1 ] 7\u2192 y(t) \u2208 S such that y(ti ) = xi , i = 0, 1, and\ngt (\u1e8f(t), \u1e8f(t)) \u2264 1\n\nfor all t \u2208 [t0 , t1 ]\n\n\f20\n\nA.M. Candela, J.L. Flores, M. S\u00e1nchez\n\n(notice that t 7\u2192 (y(t), t) would be future\u2013directed causal).\nTo this aim, we need the following lemmas.\nLemma 5.8 If there exists a sequence of C 1 curves t \u2208 [t0 , t1 ] 7\u2192 yn (t) \u2208 S\nsuch that yn (ti ) = xi , i = 0, 1 and, for some sequence \u01ebn \u0581 0,\ngt (\u1e8fn (t), \u1e8fn (t)) \u2264 1 + \u01ebn\n\nfor all t \u2208 [t0 , t1 ],\n\nthen z0 <U z1 .\n\u221a\nProof. The curves t 7\u2192 (yn (t),\u221at0 + 1 + \u01ebn (t\u2212t0 )) are future\u2013directed and causal;\nthus, z0 <U z1,n = (x1 , t0 + 1 + \u01ebn (t1 \u2212 t0 )). As U is convex, the relation \u2264U\nis closed and the result follows passing to the limit as n \u2192 +\u221e.\nLemma 5.9 Writing the H 1 curve \u03b3 as \u03b3(s) = (x(s), t(s)), if s \u2208 [s0 , s0 + \u03b4],\nthen function s 7\u2192 t(s) is strictly increasing.\nProof. As \u03b3 is absolutely continuous, then\nZ s3\n\u1e6b(s)ds\nfor all s2 , s3 \u2208 [s0 , s0 + \u03b4].\nt(s3 ) = t(s2 ) +\ns2\n\nBut \u03b3\u0307(s) is a.e. future\u2013directed, so \u1e6b(s) > 0 a.e. in I; hence, t(s2 ) < t(s3 ) if\ns2 < s3 .\nBy Lemma 5.9 it follows that the x\u2013component of \u03b3 can be reparametrized by\nt, and this reparametrized curve still belongs to H 1 . In fact, it is enough\nto prove\nRt\nthat t 7\u2192 x(t) \u2261 x(s(t)) satisfies Barrow's rule x(t) = x(t0 ) + t0 (dx/dt)(t\u0304)dt\u0304,\nand this is obvious because dx/dt = (dx/ds)(ds/dt) a.e., the change of variable\ntheorem for a.e. differentiable functions is applicable (see, for example, [26,\nTheorem 6.94]), and function s 7\u2192 x(s) does satisfy Barrow's rule. Moreover, as\n\u03b3\u0307 is future\u2013directed, it has to be\n\u0013\n\u0012\ndx dx\n,\n\u22641\na.e. in [t0 , t1 ].\n(5.10)\ngt\ndt dt\nNow, take any sequence (\u1ef9n )n of C 1 curves in S with \u1ef9n (ti ) = xi , i = 0, 1, which\napproach t 7\u2192 x(t) in the H 1 norm. In particular, (\u1ef9n\u2032 )n also go to x\u2032 strongly\nin L2 norm. In order to check that the sequence of C 1 curves (yn )n formed\nby the reparametrizations of \u1ef9n to constant speed, falls necessarily under the\nhypotheses of Lemma 5.8, firstly notice that the lengths Ln = length(\u1ef9n ) =\nlength(yn ) satisfy Ln \u2192 L = length(x). Thus,\nLn\nL\ndyn\n=\n\u2192\n\u22641\ndt\nt1 \u2212 t0\nt1 \u2212 t0\n(the last inequality from (5.10)), and Lemma 5.8 applies.\n\n\fGlobal hyperbolicity and Palais\u2013Smale condition\n\n21\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors would like to acknowledge the International Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger\nInstitute for Mathematical Physics (ESI) in Vienna, where this work started,\nfor its kind hospitality during the Special Research Semester on \"Geometry\nof pseudo\u2013Riemannian Manifolds with Application in Physics\" organized by\nDmitri Alekseevski, Helga Baum and Jerzy Konderak.\n\nReferences\n[1] R.
