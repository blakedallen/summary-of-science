The calculations of the electronic properties reveal that no sign\nof an impurity band is observed, and that the Fermi level lies in the valence band of Germanium.\nMoreover, the calculation of the phonon frequencies shows that a new mode associated to the Ga\natom is appearing, around 175 cm\u22121 .\nPACS numbers: 71.15.Mb, 74.78.-w, 71.20.Nr\n\nThe surprising discovery of the superconductivity of\nMgB2 1 , with a critical temperature of about 40 Kelvins,\nhas revived the interest of the scientific community for\nthe systems presenting strong covalent bonds. Later\non, the superconductivity phenomenon was observed\nin related systems like (among others) boron-doped\ndiamond2 , silicon3 , and silicon-carbide4,5 . These findings are explained by the fact that strong covalent bonds\nand light elements give rise to high phonon frequencies\nand large electron-phonon coupling, leading sometimes\nto superconductivity. In the framework of the standard\nelectron-phonon coupling mechanism, ab-initio calculations are particularly useful, since it is possible to draw\nan almost complete picture of what is occurring, through\nthe calculations of the electronic structure, the phonons\nspectra, and even an estimation of the critical temperature with the help of the McMillan formula6 . Therefore,\nsuperconductivity has been well explained7 for example\nin the case of MgB2 8,9 or boron doped diamond10 . This is\nin contrast with the situation on copper oxides11 or ironbased superconductors12 , for which ab-initio calculations\ncan reveal the electronic structure13,14,15 , but are limited\nconcerning the description of the mechanism leading to\nsuperconductivity.\nVery recently, a new member of the superconducting\nsemiconductors has been found16 , by doping germanium\nwith gallium atoms. The critical temperature was found\nto be 0.5 K at ambient pressure, and a very low Cooperpair density was observed. However, the information concerning the electronic structure of this material are still\nvery limited. It is the aim of this publication to report\nresults obtained by ab-initio calculations on Ga-doped\ngermanium, in particular the electronic density of states,\nthe bandstructure, and the phonon spectra.\nTo perform the calculations, we have used the code\nVASP (Vienna Ab-initio simulation package)17,18 , implementing the projector augmented waves method19 within\ndensity functional theory (DFT)20,21 . The Perdew Burke\nErnzerhof22 variant of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) was used for the exchange-correlation\n(XC) potential. We have built a germanium 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 su-\n\npercell (containing 16 atoms), with one Ga atom substituting a germanium atom. This corresponds to a 6.25%\ndoping, which is close to the percentage used in the experiments (6%)16 . Then, the system was allowed to relax\ncompletely. In this case, a 6 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 6 k-points23 mesh was\nused, whereas to obtain the density of states and bandstructures, a denser 18 \u00d7 18 \u00d7 18 mesh was used. The\nplane wave cut-off was set to 500 eV.\nDue to the doping, the crystal structure is modified to\naccommodate the gallium atom in the cell. In pure germanium, the Ge-Ge bond length is about 2.50 \u00c5 (when\nrelaxed with PBE), while upon doping, the Ga-Ge distance is 2.47 \u00c5, and the Ge-Ge distance is maintained\nto almost 2.50 \u00c5. Therefore, the crystal structure is only\nslightly affected by the replacement of a Ge atom by a\nGa atom, and these structural changes remain localized\naround the Ga impurity.\nIn Fig. 1, we present our calculated total and partial\ndensity of states (DOS, PDOS) projected on the gallium\natom and on one of the germanium atom neighbouring\nit. A metallic regime is clearly observed, with the Fermi\nlevel now being approximately 0.6 eV below the valence\nband maximum of pure Ge (we are referring to a valence\nband maximum although here the density of states has\nalways a finite value, due to the well known underestimation of the band gap with standard XC functional such\nas GGA). Also, a Fermi surface with three sheets (not\nshown here) emerges around the center of the Brillouin\nzone. Moreover, there is no sign of an impurity band\nin the electronic gap, so at first sight the model of rigid\nbands doping seems likely, but this is not confirmed by\nthe bandstructure calculations: in Fig. 2, the bandstructures of pure (upper plot) and Ga-doped (lower plot) germanium are presented, for the 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 supercell. Due\nto the doping, some degeneracies are left, the bandstructure is significantly modified, and therefore the picture\nof a simple rigid band model is not valid.\nThe phonons DOS (\u0393 point only) of pure and Ga-doped\nGermanium are presented in Fig. 3. As expected, some\ndegeneracies are lifted upon the introduction of the Ga\natom, and the spectra is changed in comparison with\n\n\f2\n\nDensity of states (states/eV)\n\n14\n\nlier for boron doped diamond10 . However, this can be\nensured only by the calculation of the Eliashberg function, since on the contrary, for B-doped SiC, it was found\nthat the superconducting behaviour is controlled by the\nwhole vibrational density of states24 .\nIn summary, we have computed the electronic and vibrational properties of Ga-doped Germanium. We observed that the effect of doping is to shift the Fermi level\n\nTotal\n\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n\n2\n\n2\n1\n\n0.5\n\ns\np\n\nEnergy (eV)\n\nPartial density of states (states/eV)\n\n0\n\nGa\n\n0.4\n\n-1\n\n0.3\n0.2\n\n-2\n\nL\n\n2\n\ns\np\n\nGe\n\n0.4\n\nW\n\n\u0393\n\n\u0393\n\nX\n\nW\n\n\u0393\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n0.3\n0.2\n\n-2\n\nL\n\n0.1\n\n-10\n\n-8\n\n-6\n\n-4\n\nEnergy (eV)\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\nFIG. 1: Total (upper plot) and partial (middle and lower\nplots) density of states.

By inspection of the\neigenvectors, the new modes at 175 cm\u22121 are associated\nwith a large displacement of the Ga atom.
