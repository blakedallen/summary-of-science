For a finitely generated graded commutative K-algebra R, let cmdef R := dim R\u2212depth R denote the Cohen-Macaulay\ndefect of R.

The symbol G will always denote a linear\nalgebraic group over the algebraically closed field K of characteristic p \u2265 0, and V will\nalways denote a finite dimensional rational G-module. Then G acts on the ring K[V ] of\npolynomial functions V \u2192 K by \u03c3 * f := f \u25e6 \u03c3 \u22121 , where f \u2208 K[V ], \u03c3 \u2208 G, so we have\nK[V ] \u223c\n= S(V \u2217 ), the symmetric algebra of the dual V \u2217 = HomK (V, K). We will always\nassume that the algebra K[V ]G of invariants is finitely generated, which due to Nagata [18]\nis always true if G is reductive. We are interested in how far the invariant ring K[V ]G is from\nbeing Cohen-Macaulay. To this end we define the Cohen-Macaulay defect cmdef K[V ]G to\nbe dim K[V ]G \u2212 depth K[V ]G . Then cmdef K[V ]G \u2265 0 and K[V ]G is Cohen-Macaulay\nprecisely when cmdef K[V ]G = 0. By Hochster and Roberts [12], the invariant ring K[V ]G\nis Cohen-Macaulay if G is linearly reductive.\nSeveral papers have dealt with the depth of invariant rings of finite groups, see for\nexample [4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14, 19, 21], but there are up to today no quantitative results for\nthe depth of invariants of (infinite) algebraic groups.\nThe goal of this paper is to make a first step in this direction. To have a context for the\nresults of this paper, we mention three results from the literature explicitly: Every overview\nhas to start with the celebrated theorem of Ellingsrud and Skjelbred [6], who proved that for\n\u0001\np > 0 and G a cyclic p-group, we have cmdef K[V ]G = max dimK (V ) \u2212 dimK (V G ) \u2212 2, 0 .\nThe main part of our paper is about bringing the following two results together:\n\n1\n\n\f2 The depth of graded algebras\n\nTheorem 1.1 (Gordeev, Kemper [10, Corollary 5.15]) Let G be finite and p||G|. Then\nfor every faithful G-module V , we have\niG\nh\nlim cmdef K V \u2295k = \u221e.\n\nk\u2192\u221e\n\n(Where V \u2295k denotes the k-fold direct sum of V .)\nTheorem 1.2 (Kemper [13, Theorem 7]) Let G be reductive, but not linearly reductive. Then there exists a G-module V such that K[V ]G is not Cohen-Macaulay.\nThese two theorems should be compared with the following theorem, which is the main\nresult of our paper:\nTheorem 1.3 Let G be reductive, but not linearly reductive. Then there exists a faithful\nG-module V (that will be given explicitly in the proof ) such that\niG\nh\ncmdef K V \u2295k \u2265 k \u2212 2\n\nfor all k \u2265 1.\n\nOn the other hand, if G = SLn acts on V = K n by left multiplication, then V is a faithful\nSLn -module, and if n \u2265 2 and p > 0, then SLn is not linearly reductive. But by Hochster\n\u0002\n\u0003SL\n[11, Corollary 3.2], we have cmdef K V \u2295k n = 0 for all k \u2208 N, so Theorem 1.1 can not\nbe generalized to reductive groups that are not linearly reductive.\n\u0002\n\u0003G\nIt would be interesting to know if cmdef K[V ]G > 0 implies limk\u2192\u221e cmdef K V \u2295k =\n\u221e, but we have neither a proof nor a counterexample for this.\nAcknowledgment. This paper contains the main result of my \"Doktorarbeit\" (Ph.D.\nthesis) [16] (in German). I want to take the opportunity to thank my advisor Gregor\nKemper for his constant support.\n\n2 The depth of graded algebras\nFor the convenience of the reader, we have collected some standard facts about the depth\nof graded algebras that can be looked up in any better book on commutative algebra\nlike [2, 5]. The given references generally only treat the local case, but this case carries\nover to our graded situation. L\nFor this paper, R will denote a finitely generated\nL\u221e graded\n\u221e\nR\nwhere\nR\n=\nK.\nWe\ncall\nR\n:=\ncommutative K-algebra R =\n0\n+\nd=1 Rd the\nd=0 d\nmaximal homogeneous ideal of R. A sequence of homogeneous elements a1 , . . . , ak \u2208 R+ is\ncalled a partial homogeneous system of parameters (phsop) if height(a1 , . . . , ak )R = k. If\nk = dim R, then the sequence is called a homogeneous system of parameters (hsop), and\nthen R is finitely generated as a module over A := K[a1 , . . . , ak ]. Due to the Noether\nnormalization theorem, hsops always exist.\nThe following lemma makes it easier to find phsops in an invariant ring.\nLemma 2.1 (Kemper [13, Lemma 4]) Let G be reductive. If a1 , . . . , ak \u2208 K[V ]G form\na phsop in K[V ], then they also form a phsop in K[V ]G .\n\n2\n\n\f2 The depth of graded algebras\n\nLet M always denote a nonzero, finitely generated Z-graded R-module (the most important case is M = R). Then a sequence of homogeneous elements a1 , . . . , ak \u2208 R+\nis called a homogeneous M -regular sequence of length k if for each i = 1, . . . , k we have\nthat ai is not a zero divisor of M/(a1 , . . . , ai\u22121 )R M . If I \u2286 R+ is a proper homogeneous\nideal, then a homogeneous M -regular sequence a1 , . . . , ak \u2208 I is called maximal (in I), if\nit can not be extended to a longer M -regular sequence lying in I. Due to the theorem of\nRees, two such maximal M -regular sequences have the same length (which is finite in our\nsetup), and we write depth(I, M ) for that common length (the I-depth of M ). We call\ndepth M := depth(R+ , M ) the depth of M . In the case of M = R, every regular sequence\nis a phsop, and R is Cohen-Macaulay if and only if every phsop is a regular sequence. We\nwrite depth I := depth(I, R) for the depth of I. We always have depth I \u2264 height I, so for\nthe Cohen-Macaulay defect of I, cmdef I := height I \u2212depth I, we always have cmdef I \u2265 0.\nTheorem 2.2 ([2, Exercise 1.2.23]) Let I \u2286 R+ be a proper homogeneous ideal. Then\ndepth R \u2264 depth I + dim I.\nIn particular we have cmdef R \u2265 cmdef I.\nTo apply this theorem in order to get a good lower bound for cmdef R, one has to find\nideals I \u2286 R+ of which one knows the depth. The following lemma, which is inspired by\nShank and Wehlau [21, Theorem 2.1] is the proper tool.\nLemma 2.3 Let I \u2286 R+ be a proper homogeneous ideal of R, and a1 , . . . , ak \u2208 I be a\nhomogeneous M -regular sequence. Then depth(I, M ) = k if and only if there exists a\nm \u2208 M with m \u2208\n/ (a1 , . . . , ak )M and Im \u2286 (a1 , . . . , ak )M .\nProof. First assume that there exists a m \u2208 M with m \u2208\n/ (a1 , . . . , ak )M and Im \u2286\n(a1 , . . . , ak )M . Then obviously I only consists of zero divisors of M/(a1 , . . . , ak )M , hence\na1 , . . . , ak is a maximal M -regular sequence in I, hence depth(I, M ) = k.\nConversely assume depth(I, M ) = k. Then a1 , . . . , ak \u2208 I is a maximal homogeneous\nM -regular sequence. Then I only consists\nof zero divisors of N := M/(a1 , . . . , ak )M , so\nS\nby [5, Theorem 3.1.b] we have I \u2286 \u2118\u2208AssR (N ) \u2118, and by prime avoidance [5, Lemma 3.3]\nthere is a \u2118 \u2208 AssR N with I \u2286 \u2118. Since \u2118 is an associated prime ideal of N , there is a\nn \u2208 N \\ {0} with \u2118 = AnnR n, and for a m \u2208 M with n = m + (a1 , . . . , ak )M we have\nm 6\u2208 (a1 , . . . , ak )M and Im \u2286 (a1 , . . . , ak )M .\n\u2737\nWe will apply this lemma only in the case k = 2, since it is difficult to check if k \u2265 3\nelements form a regular sequence. To check if two elements form a regular sequence, we\nhave the following lemma.\nLemma 2.4 Let a1 , a2 \u2208 K[V ]+ be homogeneous. Then the following are equivalent:\n(a) a1 , a2 form a phsop in K[V ].\n(b) a1 , a2 form a regular sequence in K[V ].\n(c) a1 , a2 are coprime in K[V ].\nIf one (hence all) of the above conditions is satisfied and we additionally have a1 , a2 \u2208\nK[V ]G , then a1 , a2 also form a regular sequence in K[V ]G .\n\n3\n\n\f3 First cohomology of groups and the depth of invariants\n\n3 First cohomology of groups and the depth of invariants\nThe results of this section are a quantitative extension of the qualitative results of Kemper [13]. Let H be an arbitrary group and W be a KH-module (not necessarily finite\ndimensional). A map g : H \u2192 W, \u03c3 7\u2192 g\u03c3 is called a (1)-cocycle, if we have g\u03c3\u03c4 = \u03c3g\u03c4 + g\u03c3\nfor all \u03c3, \u03c4 \u2208 H. The sum of two cocycles is again a cocycle, so the set of all cocycles Z 1 (H, W ) is an additive group. For any w \u2208 W , the map H \u2192 W given by\n\u03c3 7\u2192 (\u03c3 \u2212 1)w := \u03c3w \u2212 w is also a cocycle, and we call a cocycle which is given by such\na w a (1)-coboundary. The set of all coboundaries B 1 (H, W ) is obviously a subgroup of\nZ 1 (H, W ), and we write H 1 (H, W ) := Z 1 (H, W )/B 1 (H, W ) for the corresponding factor\ngroup. We call a cocycle g non-trivial, if it is not a coboundary, and we will often confuse an element g \u2208 Z 1 (H, W ) with its image (also denoted g) in H 1 (H, W ). Thus g is\nnon-trivial if and only if g 6= 0 in H 1 (H, W ). If H is a linear algebraic group and W a\nrational (not necessarily finite dimensional) H-module, then by Z 1 (H, W ) we will always\nmean the cocycles that are given by morphisms of H to W (this is automatic for B 1 ). Now\nlet a \u2208 K[V ]G be an invariant. Then for any g \u2208 Z 1 (G, K[V ]), we can define an element\nag \u2208 Z 1 (G, K[V ]) by (ag)\u03c3 := ag\u03c3 for all \u03c3 \u2208 G. Obviously, multiplication with a gives a\ngroup homomorphism Z 1 (G, K[V ]) \u2192 Z 1 (G, K[V ]), and induces a group homomorphism\nH 1 (G, K[V ]) \u2192 H 1 (G, K[V ]). Now for any g \u2208 H 1 (G, K[V ]), we define its annihilator as\n\b\nAnnK[V ]G (g) := a \u2208 K[V ]G : a * g = 0 \u2208 H 1 (G, K[V ]) \u2702 K[V ]G .\nThis ideal is proper if and only if g 6= 0 \u2208 H 1 (G, K[V ]). We call a 0 6= g \u2208 Z 1 (G, K[V ])\nhomogeneous of degree d \u2265 0, if g\u03c3 \u2208 K[V ]d for all \u03c3 \u2208 G. An element of H 1 (G, K[V ]) \\ {0}\nis called homogeneous of degree d \u2265 0, if it can be represented by a homogeneous element\nof degree d of Z 1 (G, K[V ]) \\ B 1 (G, K[V ]) (this is well defined). If g \u2208 H 1 (G, K[V ]) is\nhomogeneous, then its annihilator AnnK[V ]G (g) is also homogeneous.\nThe proof of the following proposition has some overlap with the one of Kemper [13,\nProposition 6], but we get a sharper result here.\nProposition 3.1 Let 0 6= g \u2208 H 1 (G, K[V ]) be homogeneous, and assume there exist two\nhomogeneous elements a1 , a2 \u2208 AnnK[V ]G (g) of positive degree that are coprime in K[V ].\nThen\ndepth(AnnK[V ]G (g)) = 2.\nProof. Because of Lemma 2.4, a1 , a2 form a K[V ]G -regular sequence in AnnK[V ]G (g). Since\nai g = 0 \u2208 H 1 (G, K[V ]) (i=1,2), there are elements b1 , b2 \u2208 K[V ] such that\nai g\u03c3 = (\u03c3 \u2212 1)bi\n\nfor all \u03c3 \u2208 G, i = 1, 2.\n\nNow set m := a1 b2 \u2212 a2 b1 \u2208 K[V ]G . We will show that m fulfills the hypotheses of\nLemma 2.3 with R = M = K[V ]G , I = AnnK[V ]G (g) and k = 2, i.e. m 6\u2208 (a1 , a2 )K[V ]G and\nm AnnK[V ]G (g) \u2286 (a1 , a2 )K[V ]G . Then Lemma 2.3 yields depth(AnnK[V ]G (g)) = 2.\nAssume by way of contradiction m \u2208 (a1 , a2 )K[V ]G . Then there are f1 , f2 \u2208 K[V ]G with\nm = a1 b2 \u2212 a2 b1 = f1 a1 + f2 a2 .\nThen a1 (b2 \u2212 f1 ) = a2 (f2 + b1 ), and a1 , a2 being coprime in K[V ] yields that a1 is a divisor\nof f2 + b1 , hence f2 + b1 = a1 * h with h \u2208 K[V ]. Now\na1 * (\u03c3 \u2212 1)h = (\u03c3 \u2212 1)(a1 h) = (\u03c3 \u2212 1)(f2 + b1 ) = (\u03c3 \u2212 1)b1 = a1 g\u03c3\n\n4\n\nfor all \u03c3 \u2208 G,\n\n\f4 Invariant rings with big Cohen-Macaulay defect\n\nhence g\u03c3 = (\u03c3 \u2212 1)h for all \u03c3 \u2208 G. But then g = 0 \u2208 H 1 (G, K[V ]) contradicting the\nhypotheses of the proposition. Hence we really have m \u2208\n/ (a1 , a2 )K[V ]G . Now we show\nm AnnK[V ]G (g) \u2286 (a1 , a2 )K[V ]G . Let a3 \u2208 AnnK[V ]G (g). Then there is a b3 \u2208 K[V ] with\na3 g\u03c3 = (\u03c3 \u2212 1)b3 for all \u03c3 \u2208 G. Let\nuij := ai bj \u2212 aj bi \u2208 K[V ]G for 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 3.\nObviously, m = u12 and we have\nu23 a1 \u2212 u13 a2 + ma3 =\n\na1 a2 a3\na1 a2 a3\nb1 b2 b3\n\n= 0,\n\nhence ma3 \u2208 (a1 , a2 )K[V ]G . Since a3 \u2208 AnnK[V ]G (g) was arbitrary, we have m AnnK[V ]G (g) \u2286\n\u2737\n(a1 , a2 )K[V ]G .\nTechnically, the following theorem is our main result.\nTheorem 3.2 Assume there is a 0 6= g \u2208 H 1 (G, K[V ]). Let a1 , . . . , ak \u2208 K[V ]G with\nk \u2265 2 and ai g = 0 \u2208 H 1 (G, K[V ]) for i = 1, . . . , k. If one of the following two conditions\n(a) G is reductive and a1 , . . . , ak form a phsop in K[V ].\n(b) a1 , a2 are coprime in K[V ], and a1 , . . . , ak form a phsop in K[V ]G .\nis true, then\ncmdef K[V ]G \u2265 k \u2212 2.\nIn the case of (a) and k = 3, this is Kemper [13, Proposition 6].\nProof. Condition (a) implies condition (b) by Lemma 2.4 and Lemma 2.1, so let us assume\ncondition (b). By hypothesis, height AnnK[V ]G (g) \u2265 k, and by Proposition 3.1, we have\n\u2737\ndepth AnnK[V ]G (g) = 2. Thus cmdef K[V ]G \u2265 cmdef AnnK[V ]G (g) \u2265 k \u2212 2.\n\n4 Invariant rings with big Cohen-Macaulay defect\nIn this section, given a reductive, but not linearly reductive group G and a k \u2208 N, we\nwill explicitly construct a G-module V that fulfills the hypotheses of Theorem 3.2, hence\ncmdef K[V ]G \u2265 k \u2212 2. The main step is the construction of a G-module U with a 0 6=\ng \u2208 H 1 (G, U ). For some classical groups, this has been done in Kohls [15] by explicit\ncalculation. With the help of a result of Nagata, we can give a general construction.\nDefinition 4.1 Let W, V be G-modules with W \u2286 V . Then\nHomK (V, W )0 := {f \u2208 HomK (V, W ) : f |W = 0}\nis a submodule of HomK (V, W ), and we have\nHomK (V, W )0 \u223c\n= W \u2297 (V /W )\u2217 .\n\n5\n\n\f4 Invariant rings with big Cohen-Macaulay defect\n\nProposition 4.2 (Kohls [15, Proposition 6]) Let W be a submodule of a G-module\nV and \u03b9 \u2208 HomK (V, W ) with \u03b9|W = idW . Then \u03c3 7\u2192 g\u03c3 := (\u03c3 \u2212 1)\u03b9 is a cocycle in\nZ 1 (G, HomK (V, W )0 ), which is a coboundary if and only if there exists a G-invariant complement for W .\nRegarding this proposition, we see that in order to construct a non-trivial cocycle, one has\nto find a G-module V that contains a submodule which has no complement. By definition,\nsuch a G-module V exists if and only if the group G is not linearly reductive. Next, we\nwill show how to find such a V .\nDefinition 4.3 Assume p > 0.We call the G-submodule\nF p (V ) := {f \u2208 S p (V ) : there exists a v \u2208 V with f = v p }\nof S p (V ) the p-th Frobenius power of V .\nRecall that every linear algebraic group G is isomorphic to a closed subgroup of a suitable\nGLn (K) ([22, Theorem 2.3.6]). Then K n is a faithful G-module.\nTheorem 4.4 (Nagata [17, Proof of Theorem 1]) Let p > 0, G be a connected linear\nalgebraic group, and V be a faithful G-module. The following are equivalent:\n(a) G is linearly reductive.\n(b) G is a torus.\n(c) The submodule F p (V ) of S p (V ) has a complement in S p (V ).\nCorollary 4.5 Let p > 0, G be a linear algebraic group such that the connected component\nof the unit element G0 is not a torus, and V be a faithful G-module. Then the submodule\nF p (V ) of S p (V ) has no complement in S p (V ). In particular, G is not linearly reductive.\nCorollary 4.5 together with Proposition 4.2 explicitly leads to the construction of a Gmodule U and a non-trivial cocycle g \u2208 Z 1 (G, U ). All we need to start is a faithful\nG-module (which always exists). So the next step is to find annihilators of g. If W is\nanother G-module and w \u2208 W G , then for a g \u2208 Z 1 (G, U ) we can define in an obvious\nmanner w \u2297 g \u2208 Z 1 (G, W \u2297 U ), and we also get a map w\u2297 : H 1 (G, U ) \u2192 H 1 (G, W \u2297 U ).\nLet g \u2208 Z 1 (G, V ). Then the K-vector space \u1e7c := V \u2295 K can be turned into a G-module\nwith the G-action given by \u03c3 * (v, \u03bb) := (\u03c3v + \u03bbg\u03c3 , \u03bb) for all (v, \u03bb) \u2208 \u1e7c , \u03c3 \u2208 G. Up to\nG-module isomorphism, \u1e7c only depends on g + B 1 (G, V ). We call \u1e7c the (corresponding)\nextended G-module of V (by g).\nProposition 4.6 (Kemper [13, Proposition 2]) Let U be a G-module, g \u2208 Z 1 (G, U )\nbe a cocycle, and let \u0168 = U \u2295 K be the extended G-module corresponding to g. Let further\nbe \u03c0 : \u0168 \u2192 K, (u, \u03bb) 7\u2192 \u03bb (with u \u2208 U, \u03bb \u2208 K). Then \u03c0 is invariant, \u03c0 \u2208 \u0168 \u2217G , and\n\u03c0 \u2297 g = 0 \u2208 H 1 (G, \u0168 \u2217 \u2297 U ).\nTheorem 4.7 Let G be a reductive group, U be a G-module such that there\nL is a 0 6= g \u2208\nH 1 (G, U ) and \u0168 be the corresponding extended G-module. If V := U \u2217 \u2295 ki=1 \u0168 , then we\nhave cmdef K[V ]G \u2265 k \u2212 2.\n\n6\n\n\f4 Invariant rings with big Cohen-Macaulay defect\n\nProof. Since U is a direct summand of K[V ] = S(V \u2217 ), we have (after an embedding)\n0 6= g \u2208 H 1 (G, K[V ]). Let a1 , . . . , ak \u2208 K[V ]G be the k copies of the element \u03c0 \u2208 \u0168 \u2217G of\nProposition 4.6 in the k summands \u0168 \u2217 of K[V ]. Then a1 , . . . , ak form a phsop in K[V ] and\nwe have ai g = 0 \u2208 H 1 (G, K[V ]) for i = 1, . . . , k. Now the result follows from Theorem 3.2,\ncase (a).\n\u2737\nTheorem 4.8 Under the hypotheses of Theorem 4.7, with V := U \u2217 \u2295 \u0168 , we have\niG\nh\ncmdef K V \u2295k \u2265 k \u2212 2 for all k \u2208 N.\n\nIf W is any faithful G-module, then V := W \u2295 U \u2217 \u2295 \u0168 is faithful, and the theorem\nabove remains valid with this V . Now let G be a reductive group that is not linearly\nreductive. Then by definition, there exists a G-module M with a submodule N \u2286 M\nwithout complement. By Proposition 4.2, the module U := HomK (M, N )0 satisfies the\nhypotheses of Theorem 4.7 or 4.8, so we have proved Theorem 1.3. Together with the\ntheorem of Hochster and Roberts, this immediately leads to the following characterization\nof linearly reductive groups:\nCorollary 4.9 A reductive group G is linearly reductive if and only if there is a global\nCohen-Macaulay defect bound, i.e. a number b \u2208 N with cmdef K[V ]G \u2264 b for all Gmodules V .\nBringing all construction steps together, we get the following explicit result. We will\nrestrict ourselves to the case that G0 is not a torus. See [16, Satz 4.2] for the other case.\nTheorem 4.10 Let p > 0 and G be a reductive group such that G0 is not a torus, and V\nbe a faithful G-module. Let\nU := HomK (S p (V ), F p (V ))0 \u223c\n= F p (V ) \u2297 (S p (V )/F p (V ))\u2217 ,\n(see Definition 4.1) and \u03b9 \u2208 HomK (S p (V ), F p (V )) with \u03b9|F p (V ) = idF p (V ) . Then with\ng : G \u2192 U, \u03c3 7\u2192 (\u03c3 \u2212 1)\u03b9 we have a 0 6= g \u2208 H 1 (G, U ). Let \u0168 be the corresponding extended\nG-module. Then the G-module\np\n\n\u2217\n\np\n\np\n\nMk := F (V ) \u2295 (S (V )/F (V )) \u2295\n\nk\nM\n\n\u0168\n\ni=1\n\nis faithful, and we have\ncmdef K [Mk ]G \u2265 k \u2212 2\n\nfor all k \u2265 0.\n\nProof. By Proposition 4.2 and Corollary 4.5, we have 0 6= g \u2208 H 1 (G, U ). The direct\nsummand F p (V )\u2217 of Mk is faithful since V is, hence Mk is faithful. Since the module U = F p (V ) \u2297 (S p (V )/F p (V ))\u2217 is a direct summand of the second symmetric power\nS 2 (F p (V ) \u2295 (S p (V )/F p (V ))\u2217 ), it is also a direct summand of K[Mk ] = S(Mk\u2217 ), hence after\nan embedding we have 0 6= g \u2208 H 1 (G, K[Mk ]). Now the proof proceeds like the one of\nTheorem 4.7.\n\u2737\nRemark. Comparing with Theorem 4.7, we see that in the definition of Mk we replaced\nthe summand U \u2217 = F p (V )\u2217 \u2297 (S p (V )/F p (V )) by F p (V )\u2217 \u2295 (S p (V )/F p (V )). This makes\nMk faithful and leads in most cases to a lower dimension of Mk .\n\n7\n\n\f5 Examples for SL2 and Ga invariants in positive characteristic\n\n5 Examples for SL2 and Ga invariants in positive characteristic\nThe group SL2 acts faithfully by left multiplication on U := K 2 . Let {X, Y } be the standard\nbasis of U , so we have U = hX, Y iK . We use the notation like S 2 (U ) =: hX 2 , Y 2 , XY i and\nF p (U ) =: hX p , Y p i. Explicit calculations of the modules Mk of Theorem 4.10 lead to the\nfollowing examples. These calculations can be found in Kohls [15, section 3], where we had\nto restrict ourselves to the case k = 3 since we did not have Theorem 3.2.\nExample 5.1 Let p = 2. Then\n#SL2\nk\nM\n2\n2\nhX , Y , XY i\n\u2265 k \u2212 2 for all k \u2208 N.\ncmdef K hX , Y i \u2295\n\"\n\n2\n\n2\n\ni=1\n\nExample 5.2 Let p = 3. Then with\nMk := hX 3 , Y 3 i \u2295 hX, Y i \u2295\n\nk\nM\n\nS 4 (hX, Y i)\n\ni=1\n\nor\n\nk\nM\nhX 2 , Y 2 , XY i\nMk := hX 3 , Y 3 i \u2295 hX, Y i \u2295\ni=1\n\nwe have cmdef K[Mk ]SL2 \u2265 k \u2212 2 for all k \u2208 N. In the second case, Mk is self-dual and\ncompletely reducible, since its summands are.\nOne can use Roberts' isomorphism [20] to turn an example for the group SL2 into an\nexample for the additive group Ga = (K, +): Every SL2 -module V can\nas a\n\u0013\n\u0012 be regarded\n1 t\n. Roberts'\nmodule of the additive group Ga by the embedding Ga \u0592\u2192 SL2 , t 7\u2192\n0 1\nisomorphism (see [3, Example 3.6]) says we then have\nK[hX, Y i \u2295 V ]SL2 \u223c\n= K[V ]Ga .\nIt is probably worth remarking that in positive characteristic, it is not known if for every\nGa -module V the invariant ring K[V ]Ga is finitely generated, while in characteristic zero\nthis is Weitzenb\u00f6ck's Theorem [23]. If V is a SL2 -module and we have used Theorem 3.2 in\ncase (a) to show cmdef K[V ]SL2 \u2265 k \u2212 2, then we also have cmdef K[hX, Y i\u2295 V ]SL2 \u2265 k \u2212 2,\nbecause all the hypotheses of the theorem made for K[V ] will still hold for K[hX, Y i \u2295 V ].\nThen by Roberts' isomorphism, we also have cmdef K[V ]Ga \u2265 k \u2212 2. In the case that\nhX, Y i already is a direct summand of V , so V \u223c\n= hX, Y i \u2295 V \u2032 with a SL2 -module V \u2032 , then\nRoberts' isomorphism directly tells us cmdef K[V \u2032 ]Ga \u2265 k \u2212 2. In particular, the examples\n5.1 and 5.2 for the group SL2 can easily be turned into examples for the group Ga - e.g.\nh\niG a\nL\nfor p = 3 we have cmdef K hX 3 , Y 3 i \u2295 ki=1 hX 2 , Y 2 , XY i\n\u2265 k \u2212 2 for all k \u2265 1.\nIf G is a non-trivial, connected unipotent group, there is a surjective algebraic homomorphism G \u2192 Ga (see [3, last paragraph before section 3] for a proof of this well-known\nresult). So if V is any Ga -module, it can be regarded as a G-module with the same invariant\nring. In particular, we have\n\n8\n\n\fReferences\n\nTheorem 5.3 For every non-trivial, connected unipotent group G over an algebraically\nclosed field K of characteristic p > 0, there exists a G-module V such that K[V \u2295k ]G is\nfinitely generated and cmdef K[V \u2295k ]G \u2265 k \u2212 2 for all k \u2265 1.\nThe modules Mk of Theorem 4.10 often are not very \"nice\", in particular they have big\ndimensions. With some more effort, we succeeded to construct \"nicer\" modules for the\ngroups SL2 and Ga such that the invariant rings have big Cohen-Macaulay defect. We just\nstate the result here, and refer to my thesis [16, pp. 113-126] for the proof.\nTheorem 5.4 Let hX, Y i be the natural representation of SL2 and p > 0. Let\np\n\np\n\nV := hX , Y i \u2295\n\nk\nM\n\nhX, Y i.\n\ni=1\n\nThen we have\ncmdef K[V ]Ga \u2265 k \u2212 2\n\nand\n\ncmdef K[V ]SL2 \u2265 k \u2212 3.\n\nAs a direct sum of self dual Ga - or SL2 - modules, V is self-dual, too. Regarded as SL2 module, V is completely reducible as a direct sum of irreducible SL2 -modules. Furthermore,\ndim K[V ]Ga = 2k + 1\nGa\n\ndepth K[V ]\n\n\u2264k+3\n\nand\nand\n\ndim K[V ]SL2 = 2k \u2212 1,\nSL2\n\ndepth K[V ]\n\nso we have\n\n\u2264 k + 2.\n\nWe have the conjecture that all inequations in this theorem in fact are equations if\nk \u2265 2 and k \u2265 3 for Ga and SL2 respectively. We were able to verify this conjecture\nwith computational methods using Magma [1] for the group Ga in the cases (p, k) \u2208\n{(2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 3)} - then by Roberts' isomorphism, the conjecture is also true\nfor SL2 and the corresponding pair (p, k + 1). See [16, pp. 129-140] for the computational\ndetails. It is interesting to compare this theorem with the result of Hochster that we\nmentioned in the text below Theorem 1.3.\n\nReferences\n[1] Wieb Bosma, John Cannon, and Catherine Playoust.
