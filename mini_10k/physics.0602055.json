In the present work, we display our\npredictions about absolute magnitude of daily fluctuations of the Dow Jones Industrials\nAverage (DJIA), utilizing the original theory of conservation of total energy, for the coming\n500 days.\nIntroduction\nOne may define total energy (ET) for prices \u03c7(t) (taking mass equal to unity) as\nET= 1\u20442 v2 + U ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere v is the usual speed, i.e., v(t)=d\u03c7(t)/dt, and U is the potential energy. In literature a few\nnumber of references, which utilize the idea of potential energy is found [1-10]. J-P.\nBouchaud, and R. Cont [1] developed a quadratic form within a Langevin approach, and in\n[2], J-P. Bouchaud studied a more complex expression involving a term with power three\nbesides a quadratic one. In [3, 4] a potential energy corresponding to some states of random\nmotion is phrased. An angle dependent potential is utilized to describe equilibrium and off\nequilibrium price states in [5]. K. Ide and D. Sornette studied oscillatory finite-time\nsingularities in finance [6, 7], where the time derivative of speed was written in terms of a\nn\n\nm\n\nlinear combination of \u03c7 and v , with arbitrary powers (See Eqs. (11)-(13), (32), (33), in [6],\nand Eqs. (1)-(3) in [7].) There, no assumption about the conservation of the sum of kinetic and\npotential energies was made. They have obtained oscillations and up (down) trends by\nneglecting the speed and restoring terms, respectively. Recently, we described some aspects\nof potential energy for price oscillations in [8], in terms of buying and selling processes\nwithin a herding mechanism. More recently, we proposed and utilized conservation of sum of\npotential and kinetic energy to make some predictions on several world indices [9, 10], where\na linear potential energy (U=g\u03c7) was also proposed for the current epoch of DJIA, S&P500,\nand NASDAQ. The corresponding equations of motion (obtained by taking the time time\nderivative of Eq. (1) and equating it to zero as d2\u03c7(t)/dt2 = -g, and integrating afterwards)\n\u03c7(t) = \u03c70 + v0t \u2013 1\u20442 g t2\n\n(2)\n\n\fsurvived as valid for the behavior of the DJIA, S&P500, and NASDAQ[8,10], within the last\nnine months after we proposed it, as shown for DJIA in Fig. 1. Unit for price (value) is taken\nas local currency unit (lcu), and for time as (day).\nIn the present work DJIA will be focused on, because its time domain is the longest and\nvolume is largest of all the world indices. One may see Fig. 1. and its caption for the explicit\nform of Eq. (2) and the parameters therein, where (and in other related figures and\ncomputations) real data in [11] is utilized up to 30 Dec 2005.\n\nConservation of total energy and predicting daily fluctuations for future\nAs shown empirically in [10], the general trends averaged over months or years gave a\nroughly conserved total energy. The corresponding equation of motion for the current epoch,\nEq. (2), may be decorated for future's probable behavior of the price as\n\u03c7future(t) = \u03c7(t) (1 \u2013 \u03b1(0.5-\u03b4(t)) ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03c7(t) is the expression in Eq (2), and \u03b4(t) is the random function with 0\u2264\u03b4(t)<1. In Eq(4)\n\u03b1 is any scaling factor, which controls the maximum value of deviation of the probable future\nvalue of the index from Eq. (2), where the shape remains independent of \u03b1. In reality \u03b1 may\nalso depend on the regulations of the exchange, since in some countries arbitrary fluctuations\nare not allowed and limited by law. \u03b1 maybe taken as 0.3 for DJIA for reasonable results with\n\u00b115% daily variations (probable) at maximum. It is clear that perfection can never be reached\nwith any prediction, yet one may try better randomization processes for better\napproximations. Utilizing Eq. (9) of [8], we obtained the results displayed in Figs. 2. a., b.,\nwhere the initial date (i.e. the first day) is taken as 02 Jan 1998. In the upper part of Fig. 2. b.,\nthe original (one of the probable) results are displayed with a shifted vertical axis, in order to\nseperate the upper curve from the lower one. In the lower curve of Fig. 2. b., which involves\nresults of the real data, fluctuations after t=1251 (day) have become smaller than they were\nbefore. For the term 1< t < 625 (day) the same effect is also present but less visible, where\nsome fluctuations have occured with big amplitudes at a few number of days.\n\nSummary and conclusion\nWith a linear potential energy for the current epoch of DJIA, energy conservation theory\nyields in equations of motion for the index in terms of long-term moving averages, which may\nbe utilized by some random decoration processes for future. Then the resulting decorated\nindex value may be used for short-term (day to day) fluctuations and for their averages. As\npredicted within the present formalism, the index will fall to 8,000's and below within the\ncoming 500 days, as a result the fluctions will increase accordingly, as shown on the right\nhand side bottom corner of Fig 2. a.\n\nAcknowledgement\nThe author is thankful to Dietrich Stauffer for his friendly discussions and corrections, and\nsupplying some references.\n\n\fReferences\n[1] J-P.
