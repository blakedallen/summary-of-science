The recent first good localizations of short bursts\nby the Swift and Hete satellites were interpreted as a possible confirmation of this hypothesis [6, 7, 8, 9, 10], because\nthe bursts have observational characteristics which are different from those of long GRBs, but which are in agreement\nwith expectations from compact object mergers as e.g. the energetics and the association with old stellar populations.\nThe central engines of such bursts are still poorly understood and observationally undetermined. But it seems unlikely\nthat the energies required for typical short GRBs are set free during the dynamical phase of the merging of two NSs.\nInstead, the following secular accretion phase in a postmerger system consisting of a central BH and a surrounding\ntorus seems to be a much more promising source (see e.g., [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]) provided the torus is sufficiently\nmassive. Thermal energy release preferentially above the poles of the BH by the annihilation of neutrino-antineutrino\n(\u03bd \u03bd\u0304 ) pairs can lead to collimated, highly relativistic jets of baryonic matter [16]. The gamma radiation is then produced\nin internal shocks when different blobs of ultrarelativistic matter in the jet collide with each other. When the jet hits\nthe ambient interstellar medium, the less energetic afterglow radiation is produced.\nTorus mass as well as BH mass and rotation are thus crucial parameters that determine the energy release from the\nmerger event. Here, we summarize results from our recent 3D relativistic hydrodamics simulations of BNS mergers\n[17, 18] to investigate the dependence of the torus and BH properties on the initial BNS parameters like the nuclear\nEoS, the NS masses and mass ratio and the NS spins.\nIn the following, we define the torus by the condition that the specific angular momentum of a fluid element in\nthe torus has to be larger than the innermost stable circular orbit of a Kerr black hole with the mass and the rotation\nparameter of the remnant. The latter in turn is defined as all the matter which is not in the torus.\n\nRESULTS FROM RELATIVISTIC HYDRODYNAMICS SIMULATIONS OF BNS\nMERGERS\nUsing our relativisic smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code [18], we have simulated a large set of BNS merger\nmodels, varying the EoS, the initial neutron star mass ratio, the total mass and the NS spins.\nWe have used two realistic, non-zero temperature EoSs whose supranuclear parts base upon two fundamentally\ndifferent approaches to determine the nuclear interaction. The EoS of Shen et al. [19, 20] (\"Shen-EoS\") bases on the\nphenomenological relativistic mean field (RMF) approach, while the EoS of Lattimer and Swesty [21] (\"LS-EoS\")\nemploys the finite-temperature compressible liquid droplet model for the nucleus [22]. In addition, we consider an\nideal gas EoS whose adiabatic index \u0393 is adjusted to fit the Shen-EoS in the supranuclear regime.\n\n\fTABLE 1. Setup parameters and characteristic data of our considered models. M1 and M2 denote the individual gravitational masses in isolation while Msum = M1 + M2 stands for the sum of the two (Note that the total gravitational mass M is\nslightly smaller than Msum because M also involves the negative gravitational binding energy between the two stars.). M0 is\nthe total baryonic mass, whereas q = M1 /M2 and qM = M0,1 /M0,2 is the gravitational and baryonic mass ratio, respectively.\n'Shen' stands for the full, finite temperature Shen-EoS, 'Ls' denotes the Lattimer-Swesty-EoS and 'ideal gas' means ideal\ngas EoS. The NS spin states are denoted as 'irrot' for irrotating, 'corot' for corotating, 'counter' for counterrotating, 'oppo'\nfor oppositely oriented spins and 'tilted' for a spin orientation tilted relative to the orbital spin. More specifically, we choose\nin model S1414t1 \u03a91 = 0 and \u03a92 = 0.041 \u2217 (0, 1, 0) (in cartesian coordinates) which corresponds to a spin period of the second NS of \u223c 1 ms, while in model S1414t2, \u03a91 = 0.01 \u2217 (0, 1, 1) and \u03a92 = 0.01 \u2217 (0, \u22121, 1) is chosen. Tmax is the maximum\ntemperature in MeV reached in the system during the whole evolution. It is obtained by averaging the particle temperatures\n2\non a grid of 1.5km side length. amerging = Jmerging /Mmerging\nis the (total) spin parameter measured immediately after merger\nand Mtorus denotes the estimated (baryonic) torus mass. Note that in model LS1216 the maximal temperature and the torus\nmass cannot be determined because the merger remnant collapses immediatedy after merging.\nModel\nM1\nM2\nMsum\nM0\nq\nqM\nEoS\nSpin\nTmax amerging Mtorus\nS1414\nS138142\nS135145\nS1315\nS1216\nS1515\nS1416\nS1317\nS119181\nS107193\nS1313\nS1214\nS1115\n\n1.4\n1.38\n1.35\n1.3\n1.2\n1.5\n1.4\n1.3\n1.19\n1.07\n1.3\n1.2\n1.1\n\n1.4\n1.42\n1.45\n1.5\n1.6\n1.5\n1.6\n1.7\n1.81\n1.93\n1.3\n1.4\n1.5\n\n2.8\n2.8\n2.8\n2.8\n2.8\n3.0\n3.0\n3.0\n3.0\n3.0\n2.6\n2.6\n2.6\n\n3.032\n3.032\n3.034\n3.037\n3.039\n3.274\n3.274\n3.279\n3.289\n3.306\n2.800\n2.799\n2.807\n\n1.0\n0.97\n0.93\n0.87\n0.75\n1.0\n0.88\n0.76\n0.66\n0.55\n1.0\n0.86\n0.73\n\n1.0\n0.97\n0.93\n0.86\n0.73\n1.0\n0.86\n0.75\n0.63\n0.52\n1.0\n0.85\n0.71\n\nShen\nShen\nShen\nShen\nShen\nShen\nShen\nShen\nShen\nShen\nShen\nShen\nShen\n\nirrot\nirrot\nirrot\nirrot\nirrot\nirrot\nirrot\nirrot\nirrot\nirrot\nirrot\nirrot\nirrot\n\n\u00d7\u00d7\n\u00d7\u00d7\n\u00d7\u00d7\n\u00d7\u00d7\n\u00d7\u00d7\n\u00d7\u00d7\n\u00d7\u00d7\n\u00d7\u00d7\n\u00d7\u00d7\n\u00d7\u00d7\n\u00d7\u00d7\n\u00d7\u00d7\n\u00d7\u00d7\n\nP1315\n\n1.3\n\n1.5\n\n2.8\n\n3.064\n\n0.87\n\n0.86\n\nideal gas\n\nirrot\n\n\u00d7\u00d7\n\nLS1414\nLS1216\n\n1.4\n1.2\n\n1.4\n1.6\n\n2.8\n2.8\n\n3.077\n3.087\n\n1.0\n0.75\n\n1.0\n0.73\n\nLs\nLs\n\nirrot\nirrot\n\n\u00d7\u00d7\n\u00d7\u00d7\n\nS1414co\nS1414ct\nS1414o\nS1414t1\nS1414t2\nS1216co\nS1216ct\n\n1.4\n1.4\n1.4\n1.4\n1.4\n1.2\n1.2\n\n1.4\n1.4\n1.4\n1.4\n1.4\n1.6\n1.6\n\n2.8\n2.8\n2.8\n2.8\n2.8\n2.8\n2.8\n\n3.032\n3.032\n3.032\n3.032\n3.032\n3.039\n3.039\n\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n0.75\n0.75\n\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n0.73\n0.73\n\nShen\nShen\nShen\nShen\nShen\nShen\nShen\n\ncorot\ncounter\noppo\ntilted\ntilted\ncorot\ncounter\n\n\u2191\n\u2193\n\u2191\n\u2190\n\u0580\n\u2191\n\u2193\n\n\u2191\n\u2193\n\u2193\n\u00d7\n\u057f\n\u2191\n\u2193\n\n52\n50\n50\n50\n54\n67\n55\n65\n57\n70\n52\n43\n50\n\n0.91\n0.90\n0.90\n0.90\n0.89\n0.89\n0.89\n0.88\n0.87\n0.84\n0.93\n0.93\n0.92\n\n0.06\n0.06\n0.09\n0.15\n0.23\n0.05\n0.17\n0.23\n0.24\n0.26\n0.08\n0.20\n0.23\n\n0.90\n\n0.15\n\n175\n\n0.86\n0.85\n\n0.03\n-\n\n40\n74\n46\n59\n39\n48\n73\n\n0.98\n0.85\n0.92\n0.95\n0.98\n0.98\n0.84\n\n0.24\n0.04\n0.11\n0.20\n0.26\n0.30\n0.20\n\nInitial data is obtained using a relaxation technique which drives the system into an equilibrium velocity field which\nis given by the orbital separation, the NS spins \u03a91 and \u03a92 , respectively and the orbital angular velocity \u03a9. The latter is\niteratively determined such that an orbital equilibrium state between gravitational and centrifugal force is established\n(see [18] for an extensive description). The NS spins are chosen either to be zero (irrotating NSs), or to be equal\n(corotating NSs) or opposed (counterrotating NSs) to the orbital spin. A few cases with non-aligned NS spins have\nalso been considered (see Tab. 1).\nIn addition, we assume the initial NSs to be cold and to be in neutrino-less beta-equilibrium which determines the\ninitial distribution of the internal energy u and the electron fraction Ye (In the ideal gas case, the polytropic relation\nu = K \u03c1 \u0393\u22121 , with K fitted to the Shen-EoS, is employed to initialize the internal energy). In Tab. 1, we summarize the\nparameters of our models. The simulations are carried out with typically 400'000 SPH particles from slightly outside\nthe innermost stable circular orbit, through the late inspiral, merging and torus formation until either the collapse of\nthe merger remnant sets in, or a quasi-stationary torus-remnant state has formed.\nIn models with a mass ratio considerably different from unity, e.g. in models S107193, S1216 or S1317, the less\nmassive but larger star is tidally elongated and disrupted to form a long spiral arm which is largely accreted onto\nits more massive merger partner. This leads to a non-axisymmetric, differentially rotating central object and a thick\nmassive torus around it. The core of the central remnant forms out of the more massive NS while the accreted material\nfrom the less massive partner is wound up to end in the outer shells of the remnant. The material sitting in the spiral\narm tip receives enough angular momentum due to a 'sling-shot-effect' to escape accretion and to contribute to the\n\n\fmain part of the future torus. This carries a significant amount of the angular momentum from the remnant out into the\ntorus (see Fig. 2). On the other hand, in case of a mass ratio near unity, as eg. in S1414 or S138142 the two partners\nsmoothly plunge together without any disruption and formation of a primary spiral arm. The two original NS cores are\nkept mostly intact during merging and form together a rotating twin-core, bar-like structure at the center of the merger\nremnant. This rotating bar drives the formation of secondary spiral arms at the remnant surface after the dynamical\nmerger phase and leads to ejection of material into a small torus. Note that primary spiral arms and large torus masses\nmay still form in these systems, if the initial NS spin setup is favourable, e.g. in case of corotating NSs.\nFor fixed EoS and NS spin, we find, that the torus mass depends roughly linear on the mass ratio for q-values larger\nthat about 0.8, whereas below that point, the torus mass saturates at about Mtorus \u2243 0.25M\u2299 . In total, the torus masses\nrange from about 0.05M\u2299 at q = 1 to 0.25M\u2299 at q = 0.55 (see Fig. 1, panel (b)).\nThe NS spin setup mainly determines the total amount of angular momentum in the system and thus directly\ninfluences the large-scale postmerger evolution, the amount of material carried into the torus and the spin parameter\nof the merger remnant. The latter particularly influences the torus mass via our definiton of the torus. If the NS are\ninitially corotating, the increase in total angular momentum is about 8% compared to the irrotating case. Similarly,\ncounterrotating NSs decrease the total angular momentum by the same amount.\nWe find, for fixed EoS (Shen-EoS) and mass ratio (q = 1), that the torus mass is indeed mainly determined by\nthe amount of total angular momentum available in the system whereas details in the merger dynamics are of minor\nimportance. Models with a different spin setup, but a similar total angular momentum yield comparable torus masses.\nThis is the case for models S1414co (corotating) and S1414t2 (Tilted spins summing up to a total spin in z-direction),\nand, to a smaller extent, for models S1414 (no spins) and S1414o (oppositely oriented spins). This suggests that\nthe torus mass dependence on the NS spin setup can be approximately reduced to a single parameter, the total angular\nmomentum in the system (see Fig. 1, panel (a)). In total, we find torus mass values between 0.04M\u2299 for counterrotating\nNSs and 0.3M\u2299 for corotating NSs.\nThe EoS influences the merger dynamics and postmerger outcome in different ways. Initially more compact NSs,\nas obtained with a soft or compressible EoS, lead to a longer inspiral phase because the tidal instability sets in at a\nsmaller orbital separation. Therefore, more angular momentum is carried away by gravitational wave radiation and\nthe angular momentum in the post-merger system is reduced which favours a smaller torus. On the other hand, the\nangular momentum transport through non-axisymmetric motion, as e.g. a rotating bar-like core, or through numerical\nviscosity is found to be more efficient if the remnant is more compact and more rapidly rotating. This in turn favours a\nlarger torus. In model LS1414 (see Fig. 1, panel (c)), about twice as much of the angular momentum is radiated away\n( 15% compared to 8% in model S1414) and the torus mass shortly ( 3ms) after merger is about half as large ( 0.03M\u2299\nversus 0.06M\u2299 ). During the following post-merger evolution the torus grows continously. The ideal gas model P1315\nleads almost to the same torus mass as the Shen-EoS model S1315. This suggests that the torus mass is determined by\nthe supranuclear part of the EoS.\n\nIMPLICATIONS FROM OBSERVATIONS OF SHORT GRBS\nIn this section we discuss the implications to the postmerger system properties from the recent observations and\nlocations of six short GRBs by the Swift and HETE satellites. Several observational results suggest, that at least part\nof the short GRBs may come from binary NS mergers. Short GRBs seem to be partially associated with elliptical\ngalaxies where star formation has stopped long ago. They also seem not to be associated with supernovae. This is\nconsistent with the long inspiral evolution of binary NS systems prior to merger (see e.g. [23]).\nFrom the measured isotropic equivalent energy E\u03b3 ,iso , we can now estimate, within the merger model, the mass\nwhich is accreted onto the central BH:\nE\u03b3 ,iso = f1 f2 f3 f4 f\u03a9\u2212 1Maccreted\nHere, f1 is the efficiency at which the accreted rest mass energy is converted to neutrino emission, f2 is the conversion\nefficiency of neutrino-antineutrino annilihation to e\u00b1 pairs, f3 is the fraction of the e\u00b1 -photon fireball energy which\ndrives the ultrarelativistic outflow with Lorentz factors \u0393 > 100 as required by GRBs, f4 is the fraction of the energy\nin ultrarelativistic jet matter which can be converted to gamma radiation in dissipative processes that occur in internal\nshocks in the jet and f\u03a9 = 2\u03a9jet /(4\u03c0 ) = 1 \u2212 cos \u03b8jet denotes the jet collimation factor defined as the fraction of the sky\ncovered by the two polar jets (with semi-opening angles \u03b8jet and solid angles \u03a9jet ).\n\n\f0.3\n\n0.35\nsymmetric, q=1\nasymmetric, q=0.75\n\n0.25\n\nsol\n\n[M ]\n\n0.2\n\n0.15\n\ndisc\n\n0.2\n0.15\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.05\n\n0.05\n0.85\n\n0.9\na\n\n0.95\n\n0\n0.5\n\n1\n\nMsum=3.0Msol\nMsum=2.8Msol\nMsum=2.6Msol\n0.6\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n0.1\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n0\n\u22125\n\n1\n\nq\n\nmerger\n\n(a)\n\nS1414\nS1216\nLS1414\nLS1216\nS1315\nP1315\n\n0.4\n\nM\n\nM\n\ndisc\n\nsol\n\n[M ]\n\n0.25\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\nMdisc [Msol]\n\n0.3\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\nt [ms]\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n2\nFIGURE 1.

Three different values of the total gravitational mass are chosen and marked with 'x'-sigs (Msum = 2.6M\u2299 ),\ncircles (Msum = 2.8M\u2299 ) and '+'-signs (Msum = 3.0M\u2299 ). These models use the Shen-EoS and are initially irrotating. (c) Torus\nmasses for different EoSs. The Shen-EoS models are plotted in red, while the LS-EoS models are colored in blue and the ideal gas\nEoS model in black. The more compact LS-EoS model LS1414 leads to a significantly smaller torus mass then the corresponding\nShen-EoS model S1414 shortly after merger. During the subsequent evolution, angular momentum transport by non-axisymmetric\ntidal interaction and numerical viscosity increases the torus mass. Note that the peaks initially after merger are an artifact of the\nnon-linear feedback between torus mass, remnant mass and the angular momentum of the last stable orbit in our torus-determination\nalgorithm.\n\nTABLE 2.

To estimate the accreted mass, we use the set\n( f1 , f2 , f3 , f\u03a9 , f4 ) = (0.1, 0.01, 0.1, 0.01, 0.1)\n\n(1)\n\nto obtain the values in Tab. 2. In addition, we can calculate the average accretion rate \u1e40acc = Macc /tacc & Macc /t\u03b3\nassuming that the observed GRB duration t\u03b3 is an upper limit to the accretion time tacc [16]. Despite of the crude\nassumption in (1), we find in nearly all cases values for the torus mass in the range obtained from our theoretical\nmodels. In addition, the estimated mass accretion rates lie in the ballpark of the results from postmerger accretion\ndisk simulations [12, 28, 24, 15]. Note however that all the f-factors have large uncertainties and are likely not to be\nconstant but to depend on the torus mass. For example, the neutrino annilihation efficiencies sensitively depend on the\ntemperature which in turn depends on the fluid density and thus on the torus mass. Therefore, the large values for the\ntorus mass and the accretion rate from the very luminous burst GRB051221 are not astonishing but suggest different\nvalues for the f-factors or, alternatively, a NS+BH merger as a source. Newtonian simulations of NS+BH mergers\n[29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35] suggest that, for certain mass ratios and EoSs, large torus masses in the range of 0.1 ... 1M\u2299\nmay be formed.\n\n\f40\n\n30\n\n30\n\n20\n\n20\n\n10\n\n10\ny [km]\n\ny [km]\n\n40\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u221210\n\n\u221210\n\n\u221220\n\n\u221220\n\n\u221230\n\n\u221230\nt=2.6274ms\n\n\u221240\n\u221240\n\n\u221230\n\n\u221220\n\n\u221210\n\n0\nx [km]\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\nt=1.5836ms\n\n(a)\n\n\u221230\n\n\u221220\n\n\u221210\n\n0\nx [km]\n\n10\n\n20\n\n\u221230\n\n\u221220\n\n\u221210\n\n0\nx [km]\n\n10\n\n20\n\n40\n\n30\n\n30\n\n20\n\n20\n\n10\n\n10\n\n0\n\n40\n\n0\n\n\u221210\n\n\u221210\n\n\u221220\n\n\u221220\n\n\u221230\n\n\u221230\nt=2.9293ms\n\n\u221240\n\u221240\n\n(c)\n\n30\n\n(b)\n40\n\ny [km]\n\ny [km]\n\n\u221240\n\u221240\n\n40\n\n\u221230\n\n\u221220\n\n\u221210\n\n0\nx [km]\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\nt=1.6824ms\n40\n\n\u221240\n\u221240\n\n30\n\n40\n\n(d)\n\nFIGURE 2. Characteristic snapshots of four representative models. Plotted is every 10th SPH particle in a slice around the\nequatorial plane. The matter of the two NSs is color-coded by green and blue particles. Particles ending up in the torus are plotted\nin red while the yellow circles represent particles which currently have an angular momentum larger than the angular momentum\nof the last stable orbit of the merger remnant at the end of the simulation. (By definition, the yellow and red particles coincide at\nthe end of the run.). Panel (a) shows the development of secondary spiral arms in model S1414. Panel (b) shows the large, primary\nspiral arms in model S1414co. Panel (c) shows the post-merger evolution of model L1414. The merger remnant in much more\ncompact and no secondary spiral arms are forming. As a consequence, the torus is much smaller and is developing on a longer\ntimescale. In panel (d), we see the formation of the large primary spiral arm in model S1216\n\nREFERENCES\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n\nS. Blinnikov, I. Novikov, T. Perevodchikova, and A. Polnarev, Soviet.
