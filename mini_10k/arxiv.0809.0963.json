Such transitions may be realized, e.g., in\nastrophysical environments where strong magnetic fields\nare present. Oscillations of Dirac neutrinos in an external magnetic field were studied in Ref. [1]. In this\nscenario one has a transition to the sterile neutrino state\n\u03bdR . While considering oscillations of Majorana neutrinos\nwith transition magnetic moments in an external magnetic field (see, e.g., Refs. [2, 3, 4]), one has transitions\nbetween active neutrino states since \u03bd\u03b1R = (\u03bd\u03b1L )c for a\nMajorana particle.\nNeutrino spin-flavor oscillations in solar magnetic fields\nhave been earlier studied in connection to the solar neutrino problem (see, e.g., Ref. [5]). It was thought that this\nneutrino oscillations channel could explain at least partly\nthe deficit of the electron neutrinos in the measured solar\nneutrino flux. It is now clear that such spin-flavor oscillations cannot play any significant role and the deficit can\nbe satisfactorily explained in terms of active-active conversions and the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein matter\neffect [6].\nThe influence of strong magnetic fields of neutron stars\non neutrino oscillations was studied in Refs. [7, 8, 9]. It\nwas shown that spin-flavor transition may have important effects in the neutron star environment. In these\ninvestigations neutrino spin-flavor oscillations were described for realistic profiles of matter densities and magnetic fields and the appearance of resonances in neutrino\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\u2020 Electronic\n\naddress: maxim.dvornikov@usm.cl\naddress: maalampi@cc.jyu.fi\n\noscillations was examined. For further details on the neutrino oscillations in electromagnetic fields as well as neutrino electromagnetic properties the reader is referred to\nthe recent review [10].\nIn this paper we shall return to the question of the spinflavor oscillations using an approach that differs from\nthe one usually followed. It is usual to describe neutrino oscillations, including the spin-flavor transitions, on\nthe basis of the quantum mechanical evolution equation.\nInstead of this Schr\u00f6dinger picture, we will apply relativistic quantum mechanical picture based on the Dirac\ntheory. In this approach, we will study spin-flavor oscillations of Dirac and Majorana neutrinos in matter and\nin an external magnetic field, extending our earlier use\nof the method [11, 12, 13, 14] to this new problem. We\nshould also mention that the majority of the previous\nstudies of neutrino spin-flavor oscillations are restricted\nto the case of Majorana neutrinos. We will investigate\nboth the Dirac and Majorana cases as the nature of neutrinos is still an open question [15].\nThe plan of this paper is as follows. We will start by\nwriting down the relativistic wave equations that take\ninto account the background matter and external magnetic field. We formulate the initial condition problem for\nthese systems (see also Refs. [11, 12, 13, 14]). We then\nderive for both Dirac and Majorana neutrinos a Hamiltonian analogous to that of the standard quantum mechanical approach and solve exactly the resulting evolution equation for relativistic neutrinos. We then analyze\nthe behavior of the transition probability for Dirac and\nMajorana neutrinos at various magnetic field strengths\nand matter densities. Our results will be summarized\nand their applications to some astrophysical situations\ndiscussed in Sec. V.\n\n\f2\nII.

We assume that the mass eigenstates \u03c8a , a = 1, 2, are related\nto the flavor eigenstate neutrinos through the transformation\n\u0013\n\u0012\nX\ncos \u03b8 \u2212 sin \u03b8\n, (2.1)\n\u03bd\u03bb =\nU\u03bba \u03c8a , (U\u03bba ) =\nsin \u03b8 cos \u03b8\na=1,2\n\nwhere \u03b8 is a mixing angle. In this section we shall assume\nthat the mass eigenstates are Dirac particles. We set the\nfollowing initial conditions (see also Refs. [11, 12, 13, 14]):\n\n\u0013\nf\u03b1 cos2 \u03b8 + f\u03b2 sin2 \u03b8 \u2212 sin \u03b8 cos \u03b8[f\u03b1 \u2212 f\u03b2 ]\n.\n=\n\u2212 sin \u03b8 cos \u03b8[f\u03b1 \u2212 f\u03b2 ] f\u03b1 sin2 \u03b8 + f\u03b2 cos2 \u03b8\n\u0012\n\nWe will denote gaa = ga and g12 = g21 = g. If we\nidentify the flavor \u03b1 as \u2261 \u03bd\u03bc or \u03bd\u03c4 and the flavor \u03b2 as\n\u2261 \u03bde , the effective potentials f\u03bb , \u03bb = \u03b1, \u03b2, are given by\n(see Ref. [17]):\nX\n\u221a\n(\u03bb)\nnf qf ,\nf\u03bb = 2GF\nf =e,p,n\n\n(\u03b1)\nqf\n(\u03b2)\n\nqf\n\n(f )\n=(I3L\n(f )\n\n\u2212 2Q(f ) sin2 \u03b8W ),\n\n=(I3L \u2212 2Q(f ) sin2 \u03b8W + \u03b4ef ),\n\n(2.5)\n\n(f )\n\n\u03bd\u03b1 (r, 0) = 0,\n\n(0)\n\n\u03bd\u03b2 (r, 0) = \u03bd\u03b2 eikr ,\n\n(2.2)\n(0)T\n\nwhere k = (k, 0, 0) is the initial momentum and \u03bd\u03b2\n=\n(1/2)(1, \u22121, \u22121, 1) (see below). This corresponds to a\nrelativistic neutrino of the flavor \u03b2, with its spin directed\noppositely to the particle momentum, i.e. a left-handed\nneutrino \u03bd\u03b2L . The system is taken not to contain the other\nneutrino flavor \u03bd\u03b1 initially.\nNote that from the physical point of view it would be\nmore realistic to choose a localized in space initial condition rather than that in Eq. (2.2). It is well known,\nhowever, that from the point of view of oscillations the\nplane wave and wave packet approaches in practice lead\nto equivalent results [16]. Moreover the initial condition problem (2.2) for the cases of flavor and spin-flavor\noscillations in various external fields was solved in our\nprevious publications [11, 12, 13, 14].\nThe Dirac equation for the mass eigenstates wave functions is of the form (see Refs. [13, 14]),\ni\u03c8\u0307a = Ha \u03c8a + (Vm + VB )\u03c8b ,\n\na 6= b,\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhere Ha = (\u03b1p) + \u03b2ma + ga (1 \u2212 \u03b35 )/2 is the massdiagonal part of the Hamiltonian, ma are the masses associated with the states \u03c8a , and \u03b1 = \u03b3 0 \u03b3, \u03b2 = \u03b3 0 , and \u03a3 =\n\u03b3 5 \u03b3 0 \u03b3 are Dirac matrices. The term Vm = g(1 \u2212 \u03b35 )/2\ndescribes the interaction of neutrinos with particles in\nthe background matter. The matrix (gab ), given below,\nis not diagonal in the mass eigenstate basis. The term\nVB = \u2212\u03bcB\u03b2\u03a33 is the energy operator associated with the\ninteractions of neutrinos with the magnetic field, and the\nmagnetic moment matrix (\u03bcab ) is, like (gab ), in general\nnondiagonal. The magnetic field is taken to be transversal with respect to the initial neutrino momentum, i.e.,\nB = (0, 0, B). The Vm and VB terms are responsible\nfor the possible mixing between different neutrino mass\neigenstates.\nThe matrix (gab ) that describes the interactions of neutrinos with matter is in the mass eigenstates basis of the\n\nwhere nf is the number density, I3L the third isospin\ncomponent and Q(f ) the electric charge of the background particle of the type f , \u03b8W is the weak mixing\nangle, and GF is the Fermi constant. It is assumed in\nEq. (2.5) that matter consists of electrons, protons, and\nneutrons and that it is unpolarized and at rest.\nAs to the interactions of neutrinos with the magnetic\nfield, we have assumed when writing Eq. (2.3) that the\nmagnetic moment matrix in the mass eigenstates basis is\nantidiagonal, i.e., \u03bcaa = 0 and \u03bc12 = \u03bc21 = \u03bc 6= 0. Magnetic moment matrices of this type were studied in our\nprevious works [13, 14]. The situation with the values\nof Dirac neutrino magnetic moments is disputable [18];\nhowever, the existence of large off-diagonal magnetic moments of Dirac neutrinos is not excluded. Let us note\nthat the solution to the Dirac-Pauli equation for a neutrino with \u03bcaa 6= 0 propagating in an arbitrary moving\nand polarized medium was recently obtained in Ref. [19].\nHowever in that work the case of only one neutrino flavor\nwas studied.\nThe general solution of Eq. (2.3) has the form [12, 13,\n14],\nZ\nd3 p ipr\n\u03c8a (r, t) = exp (\u2212iga t/2)\ne\n(2\u03c0)3/2\nh\nX\n(\u03b6)\n(\u03b6)\n\u00d7\na(\u03b6)\na (t)ua exp (\u2212iEa t)\n\u03b6=\u00b11\n\ni\n(\u03b6)\n(\u03b6)\n+ b(\u03b6)\na (t)va exp (+iEa t) ,\n\n(2.6)\n\nwhere the energies are given by (see, e.g., Ref.

(2.13), which we obtained to in our approach\n\n\f4\nbased on Dirac equation, with the one obtained in the\nconventional quantum mechanical formalism. To this end\nlet us introduce a quantum mechanical wave function\nL\nL\nR\nR\n\u03a8T\nQM = (\u03c81 , \u03c82 , \u03c81 , \u03c82 ) for the neutrino mass eigenL,R\nstates. Here \u03c8a are one-component objects. This wave\nfunction obeys the Schr\u00f6dinger equation with the following effective Hamiltonian (see, e.g., Ref. [3]):\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nK1 + g1\ng\n0 \u2212\u03bcB\nK2 + g2 \u2212\u03bcB 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec g\nHQM = \uf8ed\n,\n(2.14)\n0\n\u2212\u03bcB\nK1\n0 \uf8f8\n\u2212\u03bcB\n0\n0\nK2\np\nwhere Ka =\nk 2 + m2a \u2248 k + m2a /(2k) is the kinetic\nenergy of a massive neutrino. It is easy to see that this\nmatrix leads to the same dynamics as the Hamiltonian in\nEq. (2.13). Indeed, without changing the dynamics one\ncan make the following replacement HQM \u2192 HQM \u2212\ntr(HQM )/4 * I, where I is the 4 \u00d7 4 unit matrix. The\nresulting Hamiltonian is exactly the same Hamiltonian\nwe have derived in our approach.\nTo describe the evolution of the system (2.13) in a\ngeneral case, one has to solve a secular equation which is\nthe fourth-order algebraic equation (see also below). Although one can express the solution to such an equation\nin radicals, its actual form appears to be rather cumbersome for arbitrary parameters. If we, however, consider the case of a neutrino propagating in the electrically neutral isoscalar matter, i.e. ne = np and np = nn ,\na reasonable solution is possible to find. We will demonstrate later that it corresponds to a realistic physical\nsituation. As one can infer from Eq. (2.5) for the case\nof the \u03bdeL \u2192 \u03bd\u03bcR oscillations channel, in a medium with\nthis property \u221a\none has the effective potentials \u221a\nf\u03b1 \u2261 f\u03bc =\nV\u03bc = \u2212GF n/ 2 and f\u03b2 \u2261 fe = Ve = GF n/ 2, where\nn \u2261 ne = np = nn . Using Eq. (2.4) we obtain that\ng1 = \u2212g2 =\n\u221ag0 , where g0 = \u2212V cos 2\u03b8, g = V sin 2\u03b8, and\nV = GF n/ 2.\nLet us point out that background matter with these\nproperties may well exist in some astrophysical environments. The matter profile of presupernovae is poorly\nknown, and a variety of presupernova models with different profiles exist in the literature (see, e.g. Ref. [21]).\nNevertheless, electrically neutral isoscalar matter may\nwell exist in the inner parts of presupernovae consisting\nof elements heavier than hydrogen. Indeed, for example,\nthe model W02Z in Ref. [21] predicts that in a 15M\u2299\npresupernova one has Ye = ne /(np + nn ) = 0.5 in the\nO+Ne+Mg layer, between the Si+O and He layers, in\nthe radius range (0.007\u20130.2)R\u2299.\nIn this kind of background matter the effective Hamiltonian in Eq. (2.13) is replaced by\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\u03a6 + g0\ng\n0 \u2212\u03bcB\n\u2212(\u03a6 + g0 ) \u2212\u03bcB 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec g\n.\n(2.15)\nH=\uf8ed\n0\n\u2212\u03bcB\n\u03a6\n0 \uf8f8\n\u2212\u03bcB\n0\n0\n\u2212\u03a6\nWe now look for the stationary solutions of the\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation with this Hamiltonian.

(2.16) is the general solution\nof Eq. (2.13) satisfying the initial condition \u03a8(0) = \u03a80 .\nNote that we received the solution (2.16)-(2.19) of the\nevolution Eq. (2.13) under some assumptions on the external fields such as isoscalar matter with constant density and constant magnetic field. We mentioned above\nthat our method is equivalent to the quantum mechanical description of neutrino oscillations [3] which is valid\nfor a more general case of coordinate dependent external fields. The advantage of our approach consists in the\nfact that one can derive neutrinos' wave functions for arbitrary initial momenta, as it was made in Refs. [11, 12],\nand study the propagation of low-energy neutrinos. The\nassumption of constant matter density and magnetic field\nis quite realistic for certain astrophysical environments\nlike a shock wave propagating inside an expanding envelope after a supernova explosion (see also Sec. V).\nConsistently with Eqs. (2.1) and (2.2), we take the initial wave function \u03a8(0) \u2261 \u03a80 in Eq.

In the case of rapid oscillations the physically relevant quantities, rather than the\nmaxima, are the averaged values of the transition probability, which are also plotted in these figures.\nAs Figs. 1(d)-3(d) show, the interplay of the matter\neffect and the magnetic interaction can lead, for a given\nmagnetic moment \u03bc, to an enhanced spin-flavor transition if the magnetic field B has a suitable strength relative to the density of matter \u03c1. In our numerical examples\nthis occurs at \u03bcBmax = 1.1 \u00d7 10\u221212 eV for \u03c1 = 10 g/cc,\nat \u03bcBmax = 6.6 \u00d7 10\u221213 eV for \u03c1 = 50 g/cc, and at\n\u03bcBmax = 8 \u00d7 10\u221213 eV for \u03c1 = 100 g/cc. For these values\nof \u03bcB both the maxima and the average of the transition probability become considerably larger than for any\n\nother values of \u03bcB. Figures 1(b)-3(b) correspond to the\nsituation of maximal enhancement, whereas Figs. 1(a)3(a) and Figs. 1(c)-3(c) illustrate the situation above and\nbelow the optimal strength Bmax of the magnetic field.\nIt is noteworthy that the enhanced transition probability is achieved towards the lower end of the \u03bcB region\nwhere substantial transitions all occur, that is, at relatively moderate magnetic fields. At larger values of \u03bcB\nthe maximum of the transition probability approaches towards cos2 (2\u03b8). Indeed, if \u03bcB \u226b max(\u03a6, V ), the transition probability can be written in the form (see Ref. [13])\nP (t) = cos2 (2\u03b8) sin2 (\u03bcBt). It was found in Ref. [22] that\nneutrino spin-flavor oscillations can be enhanced in a very\nstrong magnetic field, with the transition probability being practically equal to unity. This phenomenon can be\nrealized only for Dirac neutrinos with small off-diagonal\nmagnetic moments and small mixing angle. As we can\nsee from Figs. 1(d)-3(d) the situation is completely different for big off-diagonal magnetic moments.\nOne should notice that for long propagation distances\n\n\f7\n0.7\n\n0.8\nP(x)\nP (x)\n\n0.6\n\nP(x)\nP (x)\n\n0.7\n\nu\n\nu\n\nP (x)\n\nP (x)\n\nd\n\nP (x)\n\n0.5\n\nd\n\n0.6\n\nP (x)\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.4\n\nP(x)\n\nP(x)\n\n0.5\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n0\n0\n\n0.1\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n4\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nx, 103 km\n\nx, 10 km\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n0.16\n\n0.8\n(max)\n\nP(x)\nP (x)\n\n0.14\n\nPd(x)\n\n0.12\n\nPu\n\n0.7\n\nu\n\n(max)\n\nP0\n\n0.6\n\nP (x)\n0\n\n0.5\n\nmax\n\n0.08\n\n0.4\n\nP\n\nP(x)\n\n0.1\n\n0.06\n\n0.3\n\n0.04\n\n0.2\n\n0.02\n\n0.1\n\n0\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n3\n\nx, 10 km\n\n0\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n\u03bc B, 10\u221211 eV\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\nFIG. 2: The same as in Fig. 1 for the density \u03c1 = 50 g/cc; (a) \u03bcB = 3.5 \u00d7 10\u221213 eV, (b) \u03bcB = 6.6 \u00d7 10\u221213 eV, (c) \u03bcB =\n5 \u00d7 10\u221212 eV.\n\nconsisting of several oscillation periods of the envelope\nfunctions, the enhancement effect would diminish considerably due to averaging.

[23]). Thus the enhanced spinflavor transition could take place when neutrinos traverse\na shock wave.\nLet us recall that the above analysis was made by assuming neutrinos to be Dirac particles. We will see below\n(see Sec. IV) that the corresponding results are quite different in the case of Majorana neutrinos.\n\nIII.\n\nEVOLUTION OF MAJORANA NEUTRINOS\nIN VACUUM\n\nMajorana neutrino states through\nX\n\u03bd\u03bbL =\nU\u03bba \u03b7a ,\n\n(3.1)\n\na\n\nwhere \u03bb = \u03b1, \u03b2 is the flavor index and \u03b7a , a = 1, 2,\ncorrespond to a Majorana particle with a definite mass\nma . In the simplest case the mixing of the flavor states\narises purely from Majorana mass terms between the lefthanded neutrinos, and then the mixing matrix U\u03bba is a\n2 \u00d7 2 and unitary matrix, i.e., a = 1, 2 and, assuming no\nCP violation, it can be parametrized in the same way as\nin Eq. (2.1).\nWe study the evolution of this system with the following initial condition [see also Eq.

(3.13) have the same order of magnitude\n\u223c m2a /|k|2 .\nBefore moving to consider Majorana neutrinos in magnetic fields we make a general comment concerning the\nvalidity of our approach based on relativistic classical\nfield theory. It has been stated [2] that the dynamics of\nmassive Majorana fields cannot be described within the\nclassical field theory approach due to the fact that the\nmass term of the Lagrangian, \u03b7 T i\u03c32 \u03b7, vanishes when \u03b7 is\nrepresented as a c-number function. Note that Eq. (3.3)\nis a direct consequence of the Dirac equation if we suggest that the four-component wave function satisfies the\nMajorana condition. Therefore a solution to Eq. (3.3),\ni.e., wave functions and energy levels, in principle does\nnot depend on the existence of a Lagrangian resulting\nin this equation. The wave equations describing elementary particles should follow from the quantum field\ntheory principles. However quite often these quantum\nequations allow classical solutions (see Ref. [29] for many\ninteresting examples). We have also demonstrated in\nRefs. [11, 12, 13, 14] that oscillations of Dirac neutrinos in vacuum and various external fields can be described in the framework of the classical field theory. The\nmain result of this section was to show that the quantum\nEq. (3.3) for massive Majorana particles can be solved\n[see Eq. (3.11)] in the framework of the classical field\ntheory as well.\n\n\f10\nIV.

[2]), supposing that the\n\n(4.5)\n\nspinors \u03b7a are expressed via anticommuting operators.\nThis quantum field theory treatment is important to explain the asymmetry of the magnetic moment matrix.\nHowever, it is possible to see that the main Eq. (4.1)\ncan also be reduced to the standard Schr\u00f6dinger evolution Eq. (4.5) for neutrino spin-flavor oscillations if we\nsuppose that the wave functions \u03b7a are c-number objects. That is why one can again conclude that classical\n\n\f11\nand quantum field theory methods for studying Majorana\nneutrinos' propagation in external fields are equivalent.\nLet us again consider the situation when ne = np =\nnn = n, which results in g1 = \u2212g2 .

(3.2), we have taken the initial\nwave function as\n\u03a8T\n0 = (sin \u03b8, cos \u03b8, 0, 0).\n\n(4.12)\n\nWith help of Eqs. (4.9) and (4.11) it is easy to check that\nC+ + C\u2212 = 0 guaranteeing P (0) = 0.\nNote that formally Eq. (4.10) corresponds to the transitions \u03bd\u03b2L \u2192 \u03bd\u03b1R . However, virtually it describes oscillations between active neutrinos \u03bd\u03b2L \u2194 (\u03bd\u03b1L )c since\n\u03bd\u03b1R = (\u03bd\u03b1L )c for Majorana particles.\nAs in the previous case of Eq. (2.21), Eq. (4.10) can\nbe treated analytically for relatively small values of the\neffective potential\np V . The ensuing envelope functions\nPu,d = P0 \u00b1 Pc2 + Ps2 depend on the coefficients C\u03b6\nand S\u03b6 in the same way as in Eq. (2.24). The transition\nprobabilities at various values of the matter density and\nthe magnetic field are presented in Fig. 4.\nDespite the formal similarity between Dirac and Majorana transition probabilities (see Eqs. (2.22) and (4.11))\nthe actual dynamics is quite different in these two cases,\nas one can see by comparing Figs. 1(d)-3(d) and Fig. 4,\npanels (b), (d) and (f). In particular, in the Majorana\n(max)\ncase Pu\n= 4|C+ C\u2212 | for arbitrary B, to be compared\n(max)\nwith Eq. (2.26), while the function P0\nhas the same\nform as in the Dirac case given in Eq. (2.27). In contrast\nwith the Dirac case, the averaged transition probability\ndoes not achieve its maximal value at some moderate\nmagnetic field Bmax value, but both Pumax and P0max are\nmonotonically increasing functions of the strength of the\nmagnetic field with 1 and 1/2 as their asymptotic values,\nrespectively. We can understand this behavior when we\nrecall that, at \u03bcB \u226b max(\u03a6, V ), the effective Hamiltonian Eq. (4.5) becomes\n\nH\u221e = i\u03bcB\u03b3 2 ,\n\n0\n\uf8ec0\n2\ni\u03b3 = \uf8ed\n0\n1\n\uf8eb\n\n0\n0\n\u22121\n0\n\n0\n\u22121\n0\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n1\n0\uf8f7\n.\n0\uf8f8\n0\n\n(4.13)\n\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation with the effective Hamiltonian (4.13) has the formal solution\n\u03a8(t) = exp(\u2212iH\u221e t)\u03a8(0)\n=[cos(\u03bcBt) + \u03b3 2 sin(\u03bcBt)]\u03a8(0).\n\n(4.14)\n\nUsing Eqs. (3.1), (4.12) and (4.14) we then immediately arrive to the following expression for the transition\nprobability, P (t) = |\u03bd\u03b1R |2 = sin2 (\u03bcBt), which explains\n(max)\nthe behavior of the function Pu\nat strong magnetic\nfields. Note that the analogous result was also obtained\nin Ref. [22].\nFinally, it is worth of noticing that in contrast to the\nDirac case, the behavior of the transition probability in\nthe Majorana case is qualitatively similar for different\nmatter densities and different magnetic fields [see Fig. 4,\npanels (a), (c), and (e)].\nThe problem of Majorana neutrinos' spin-flavor oscillations was studied in Refs. [8, 9] with help of numerical codes. For example, in Ref.

The neutrino parameters\nhave the same values as in Figs. 1-3, E\u03bd = 10 MeV, \u03b4m2 = 8 \u00d7 10\u22125 eV2 and \u03b8 = 0.6. The magnetic energy is equal to\n\u03bcB = 10\u221212 eV.

Although our analytical\ntransition probability formula (4.10) is valid only for the\nconstant matter density and magnetic field strength, it\n\nis interesting to compare our results with the numerical simulations of Ref. [8]. In those calculations the authors used magnetic fields B \u223c 1010 G and magnetic\nmoments \u223c 10\u221212 \u03bcB that give us the magnetic energy\n\n\f13\n\u03bcB \u223c 10\u221211 eV. This value is the maximal magnetic\nenergy used in our work.\nIt was found in Ref. [8] that spin-flavor conversion\nis practically adiabatic for low-energy neutrinos corresponding to E\u03bd \u223c 5 MeV inside the region where Ye \u2248 0.5\nand the averaged transition probability for the channel\n\u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u0304e is close 0.5. This big transition probability is\ndue to the RSF-H and RSF-L resonances at the distance\n\u2248 0.01R\u2299. Even so that we study two neutrino oscillations scheme, we obtained the analogous behavior of\n(max)\n(see Fig. 4). However, in our case this big tranP0\nsition probability is due to the presence of the strong\nmagnetic field (see Refs. [10, 22]). We cannot compare\nour transition probability formula (4.10) with the results\nof Ref. [8] for higher energies, E\u03bd > 25 MeV, since spinflavor oscillations become strongly nonadiabatic for these\nkinds of energies and one has to take into account the coordinate dependence of the matter density which should\ndecrease with radius as 1/r3 [32].\nV.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nWe have studied in this work the propagation of massive flavor-mixed Dirac and Majorana particles in matter under the influence of an external magnetic field in\nan approach based on relativistic quantum mechanics.\nThe magnetic moment matrix is assumed to be both in\nthe Dirac and Majorana case nondiagonal in the mass\neigenstate basis. Starting with Lorentz invariant wave\nequations, the interactions of neutrinos with matter and\nmagnetic fields included, we derived the effective Hamiltonians and solve the evolution equations for the electrically neutral matter with nn = np . We then found\nthe probabilities for the spin-flavor oscillation \u03bd\u03b2L \u2192 \u03bd\u03b1R\n(\u03bd\u03b2L \u2192 (\u03bd\u03b1L )c for Majorana neutrinos) and examined their\ndependence on the matter density and the strength of the\nmagnetic field.\nWe also studied in our approach the evolution of mixed\nmassive Majorana neutrinos in vacuum, which is an exactly solvable problem. We derived the wave functions\nof the neutrinos and the transition probabilities for the\nprocess \u03bd\u03b2 \u2192 \u03bd\u03b1 . We included the terms quadratic in\nneutrino masses and discussed the origin of these corrections of the standard formula for the probability.\nThese corrections to the Pontecorvo formula, see\nEq. (3.12), are rapidly oscillating functions suppressed by\nthe ratio ma /|k|, which is small for the relativistic neutrinos. It was revealed in our previous works [11, 12, 13, 14]\nthat the analogous terms originate from the accurate account of the Lorentz invariance in the study of oscillations of Dirac neutrinos. It is also known that in describing of evolution of Majorana neutrinos in vacuum\nthe transitions of the types \u03bd\u03b2L \u2192 \u03bd\u03b1L and \u03bd\u03b2L \u2192 (\u03bd\u03b1L )c\nare possible [33], with the transition probability of the\nlatter case being suppressed by the factor ma /|k|. The\ntransitions \u03bd\u03b2L \u2192 (\u03bd\u03b1L )c can be interpreted as neutrinoto-antineutrino oscillations and manifest in the possible\n\nneutrinoless double beta decay [34]. In our work on the\nbasis of the relativistic quantum mechanics we derived\nthe transition probability for neutrino-to-antineutrino oscillations which is consistent with the results of Ref. [33].\nOur results can be used for analyzing the behavior of\nneutrinos in supernovae, in particular in the so-called\nzero metallicity presupernovae, where the condition nn =\nnp is fulfilled [21] outside the Si+O layer. It is known that\nthese stars can possess very strong magnetic fields, up to\n1015 G, or even stronger [35].\nWe found that large rates of transitions that change\nneutrino flavors and chiralities are possible both in the\nDirac and Majorana cases with a typical oscillation\nlengths of the order of 103 \u2212 104 km for matter densities of the order of 10 \u2212 100 g/cc, for typical supernova\nneutrino energies of 10 MeV and for \u03bcB of the order of\n10\u221213 \u2212 10\u221212 eV. The parameters of a shock wave, the\ndensity and width, can vary in a rather wide range, but\ntypically they fit with the parameter values we used in\nour analysis [36]. In particular, the width of the shock\nwave can be of about the same size as the oscillation\nlength of the spin-flavor oscillations. It would thus be\npossible that the transition probability achieves its maximum value (can be as high as 0.8 in some cases) when\nneutrinos pass through the shock wave on their way towards the outer layers of the star. If the flight distance\nwere many oscillation lengths, the probability would be\naveraged to a smaller value. The results of our work\ncan have the implication to the r-process nucleosynthesis\nsince it is sensitive to the amount of neutrinos of various\nspecies emitted in a supernova [37].\nIn the Dirac case the maximum value of the transition\nprobability is achieved for a specific value of \u03bcB, while\nin the Majorana case the transition probability can be\nlarge for a wide range of \u03bcB values. Supposing that the\nneutrino magnetic moment is 3 \u00d7 10\u221212 \u03bcB , allowed by\nthe present astrophysical and cosmological data [38], the\nlargest transition in the Dirac case would occur when\nthe strength of the magnetic field is in the range 108 \u2212\n109 G. Although a magnetic field on the surface of a\nneutron star is typically stronger, 1012 \u2212 1013 G, at outer\nparts of the envelope it may have a suitable value for\na large transition to take place. The difference between\nthe dynamics of Dirac and Majorana particles under the\ninfluence of the same external fields can be a smoking\ngun to reveal the nature of neutrinos.\nNote that in the majority of the previous works devoted to the spin-flavor oscillations the analytical transition probability formulae were obtained only for Majorana neutrinos. The case of Dirac particles was studied only in connection with small off-diagonal magnetic\nmoments. Our work studies the opposite situation of\nbig off-diagonal elements of the magnetic moments matrix. The effect of the appearance of the big transition probability at moderate magnetic field strength has\nnever been described earlier. As for Majorana neutrinos\nthe enhancement of the transition probability in strong\nmagnetic fields is in agreement with the previous stud-\n\n\f14\nies [10, 22]. Note that spin-flavor oscillations of Majorana\nneutrinos can be also resonantly enhanced in the moderate magnetic field, see Ref. [5]. However this effect does\nnot happen in isoscalar matter with ne = np = nn . The\ncondition for the resonant spin-flavor precession reads [7],\nGF (ne \u2212 nn ) = \u00b1\u03b4m2 cos 2\u03b8/4k, which is not fulfilled in\nisoscalar matter.\nThe obtained analytical formulae for the transition\nprobabilities, Eqs. (2.21) and (4.10), are valid in the\nimportant case when Ye = 0.5, which is realized in\nthe zero metallicity presupernova stars. These kinds of\nstars were quite common for early stages of the galaxies\nformation. We obtained that spin-flavor oscillations of\nDirac neutrinos can be strongly influenced by the moderate magnetic field of a neutron star and the big transition probability can exist not only for Majorana neutrinos [8, 9]. Thus spin-flavor oscillations of Dirac neutrinos can significantly change the relic supernova neutrino background [39]. Although now no signal of relic\nneutrinos was observed [40], there are still some efforts\n\nto calculate the flux of relic \u03bd\u0304e for the KamLAND and\nSuper-Kamiokande detectors [41]. The reliable simulation of the supernova explosion does not exist yet. For\nexample, the propagation of a shock wave can significantly change magnitude and shape of the magnetic field\nwhich are very important in our calculations. Nevertheless it is believed that the future galactic supernova neutrino burst might give some clues to the physics of relic\nsupernova neutrinos [9].\n\n[1] A. Cisneros, Astrophys.
