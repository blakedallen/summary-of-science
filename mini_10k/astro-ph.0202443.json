By the\nRelativity Principle, the same limit must then apply to the accuracy of all clocks which\nregister time of events in their own frames. Further, it implies that the ordinary meaning\nof distance also ceases in the same manner beyond a scale lP = ctP . We demonstrate\nthat quantum space-time, if real, may be made manifest by observing very energetic\ncollisions, defined as interactions which occurred with the center-of-mass frame \u03a3\u2032 (of\nthe participating bodies) moving at a high speed v relative to our laboratory frame \u03a3.\nIn such situations, the initial conditions of the interaction are determined from direct\nmeasurements of the ultra-energetic particles or photons by instruments aboard \u03a3: they\ngather a raw dataset S which are subject to the limiting uncertainties \u223c (tP , lP ). Yet\na meaningful (i.e. experimentally verified) version of the interaction is one where the\ninteraction is viewed from frame \u03a3\u2032 . Since no instruments aboard \u03a3\u2032 have taken any data,\nthe way we proceeded is by a Lorentz transformation of S from \u03a3 to \u03a3\u2032 . Beware however\nthat the resulting S \u2032 no longer consists of raw data, i.e. Lorentz distortions of probability\ndistributions render the uncertainties non-Planckian - in fact, it will be shown that as\nv \u2192 c they are \u226b (tP , lP ), and are no longer negligible. Examples will given to indicate\nhow a proper interpretation of the most current high energy cosmic and gamma-ray data\nnecessitates incorporation of the said effect.\n\n1\n\n\fAt present no one knows the design of the most precise clock. There is nonetheless a\nbroad agreement that the unsurpassable limit is \u223c tP (see, e.g. Wilczek 2001), because\nto achieve such an accuracy a large amount of energy (hence mass) has to be confined\nwithin a small region of space - the result is a black hole. We shall therefore begin with\na standard deviation \u03c3t , which is \u223c tP , and postulate that all clocks which keep time\naboard their respective inertial platforms carry the same intrinsic uncertainty of \u03c3t (cf\nPrinciple of Relativity). The measurement of space by an inertial observer must then be\nsubject to an error \u03c3x = c\u03c3t , since by special relativity this simply involves light beams\nand synchronized clocks. Scale sizes like tP and lP , though extremely small, may soon\nbe probed by interferometric experiments (Camelia 2001, Abramovici 1996). Here we\npropose another way of testing the discreteness of time, by observing the behavior of\nultra-energetic particles and photons.\nLet us now consider the effect of frame transformation on space-time data. Suppose\ntwo inertial observers \u03a3 and \u03a3\u2032 construct their own frames of reference having spatial\naxes oriented in the same way, and that \u03a3\u2032 moves relative to \u03a3 with a speed v along\nthe +x direction1 . Suppose further that \u03a3 and \u03a3\u2032 used instruments aboard their own\nplatforms to locate an event, with the results (x, y, z, t) and (x\u2032 , y \u2032, z \u2032 , t\u2032 ) respectively,\nwhich we shall henceforth refer to as raw data (to distinguish them, in particular, from\ndata which emerge from frame transformations). According to our postulate, intrinsically\nboth sets of coordinates are equally inaccurate to within \u00b1c\u03c3t for x, y, z (and x\u2032 , y \u2032 , z \u2032 )\nand \u00b1\u03c3t for t (and t\u2032 ). This indicates the absence of a preferred frame, and remains valid\nso long as the two observers measure the event by their own clocks and light beams. The\nsymmetry will be broken, however, if e.g. \u03a3\u2032 fails to take his own data, but monitors the\nevent solely from the data taken by \u03a3. In that case, the original raw data of \u03a3 would\nappear meaningless to \u03a3\u2032 until they are processed by the Lorentz transformation L which\nnecessarily alters the uncertainties.\nFor a quantitative estimation of the effect, we note that according to L:\nx\u2032 = \u03b3(x \u2212 vt) , y \u2032 = y , z \u2032 = z , t\u2032 = \u03b3(t \u2212\n\nvx\n),\nc2\n\n(1)\n\n1\n\nwhere \u03b3 = (1\u2212v2/c2)\u2212 2 . Obviously, then, y \u2032 and z \u2032 remain uncertain by c\u03c3t . To calculate\nthe uncertainies of x\u2032 and t\u2032 one must add those of x and t in quadrature, because these\ntwo coordinates were directly and separately measured by \u03a3 their errors are independent\n(and, for the same reason, of magnitude c\u03c3t and \u03c3t respectively). Thus we have:\n\u03c3x2\u2032 = \u03b32(\u03c3x 2 + v2\u03c3t 2) = c2\u03c3t 2\n\n1+\n1\u2212\n\nv2\nc2\nv2\nc2\n\n; \u03c3t2\u2032 = \u03b32(\u03c3t 2 +\n\n1+\nv2\n\u03c3x 2) = \u03c3t 2\nc4\n1\u2212\n\nv2\nc2\nv2\nc2\n\n.\n\n(2)\n\nIn general, Eq. (2) indicates that \u03c3x\u2032 \u2265 \u03c3x , \u03c3t\u2032 \u2265 \u03c3t . Further, \u03c3x\u2032 and \u03c3t\u2032 are no longer\nindependent errors. Unlike \u03c3x and \u03c3t , they cannot be added in quadrature.\n1\n\nFor uniform motion we assume that the uncertainty in v due to space-time fluctuations may be made\narbitrarily small by adopting a large interval for the measurement of v\n\n2\n\n\fIt should be emphasized that, among the consequences which may ensue from Eq. (2),\nviolation of the Principle of Relativity is not one of them. The coordinates x\u2032 and t\u2032 carry\ncorrelated errors larger than the intrinsic values because they are not raw data. Had \u03a3\u2032\nperformed his own measurements, the results would fundamentally have been limited by\nthe quantum space-time fluctuations (\u03c3t , c\u03c3t ) in exactly the same way as those of \u03a3. Any\nsuch data taken directly by \u03a3\u2032 , when compared with the transformed data of \u03a3 (which by\nEq (2) carry larger errors) could lead to disagreement. Conversely, if \u03a3\u2032 were to transform\nby L\u22121 his own data to the \u03a3 frame, the results would likewise be subject to the same\nerror amplification and correlation as depicted in Eq (2), and could disagree with the\nmeasurements done by \u03a3 himself. Moreover, the symmetry imposed by the Principle of\nRelativity tells us that the two observers could continue to argue about 'who is correct'.\nNeither in fact is on a privileged platform. Rather, the source of the discrepancy lies with\nthe fact that when raw data are processed L they inevitably emerge with larger than\nintrinsic (Planckian) uncertainties. This is a feature of L which we have hitherto ignored.\nThe significance of Eq (2) depends on the situation it applies to. As an example, let \u03a3\nmeasure the decay time of a fast-moving particle, which we assume to be at rest relative\nto \u03a3\u2032 . The result, denoted by \u03c4 , is simply obtained by taking the difference between two\ntime coordinates, each of which\nto the same random uncertainty\n\u221a is subject independently\n\u2032\n\u03c3t , i.e. \u03c4 = t2 \u2212 t1 and \u03c3\u03c4 = 2\u03c3t . Likewise,\nif \u03a3 were to measure this particle directly\n\u221a\nhis result \u03c4 \u2032 will also be accurate to \u00b1 2\u03c3t . Now suppose no data were ever gathered\naboard \u03a3\u2032 , and the only information available concerning the rest lifetime \u03c4 \u2032 of the particle\nis the measurement of \u03a3 after Lorentz transformation to\u221athe \u03a3\u2032 frame. From Eq (2) we\nsee that L enlarges intrinsic uncertainties by the factor 2\u03b3 when v \u2192 c. This means,\nhad \u03a3\u2032 done his own measurement and compared it with the transformed data of \u03a3 there\nmay, in the case \u03b3 \u226b 1, be substantial discrepancies on the value of the rest life \u03c4 \u2032 . One\ncould insist upon a shorter lifetime than the other, which renders it inevitable that they\ncould disagree with each other in a random manner on whether the decay has taken place\nor not (the 'time sequencing' problem which will not be discussed in detail here). The\ntransformed data of \u03a3 carry a relative (percentage)\nof 2\u03b3\u03c3t /\u03c4 \u2032 , which exceeds\n\u221a uncertainty\n\u221a\n\u2032\nthat for the raw data of \u03a3 and \u03a3 by a factor of 2\u03b3 and 2\u03b32 respectively. The reliance\nof \u03a3\u2032 on the measurement of \u03a3 can no longer be justified when this relative error 2\u03b3\u03c3t /\u03c4 \u2032\nis \u2265 1, which happens for sufficiently large \u03b3.\nIn the present work we pursue to some depth the impact of the above development\non another common usage of L. Often the physics of ultra-energetic quanta cannot at\nall be perceived in our laboratory frame \u03a3 - we must transform its parameters which we\nmeasured aboard \u03a3 to another frame \u03a3\u2032 before any sensible conclusions on the nature and\nfate of the subject can be drawn. As an example, consider a 1020 cosmic ray proton in the\nvicinity of a 3K microwave background photon. While we may have data about the two\nbodies taken by laboratory detectors working in the \u03a3 frame, no experiments done aboard\n\u03a3 have ever directly witnessed how they may interact. However, from the viewpoint of\nthe proton rest frame \u03a3\u2032 a 3K photon appears, according to our laboratory data of the\ntwo particles after transformation by L, as having sufficient energy to cross the photopion production threshold. This reveals a familiar occurence in our own environment\n3\n\n\f(viz. pions from photon-proton interactions) which, by the Principle of Relativity, must\nhappen aboard \u03a3\u2032 as well. Thus we conclude that aboard \u03a3 one necessarily encounters\npions, and the required energy is now drawn from the fast proton. The logic of the above\nreasoning is sound except for one point: it presumes that L remains highly accurate when\nthe relative motion between \u03a3 and \u03a3\u2032 involves a Lorentz factor as large as \u03b3 \u223c 1011 .\nIn order to address this point, we must realize that once time and space fluctuate intrinsically the components of all four-vectors will behave similarly. The following example\nshows how to quantitatively secure the connection. Consider a plane light wave. If by\nsome means the wave frequency \u03bd is very precisely known in the regime \u03bd > 1/\u03c3t we will\nbe able to use the wave as a 'super-clock' to overcome quantum limitations - which by\nassumption is impossible. An equivalent manner of expression would state that any value\nof \u03bd can only be determined to an accuracy \u03c3\u03bd /\u03bd \u223c \u03bd\u03c3t .\nA more rigorous approach to the problem, with something similar to the above as an\noutcome, is afforded by the following abstraction of the measurement procedure. Let the\nwave phase be written as \u03c6 = (\u03c9t \u2212 kxcos\u03b8)/c where \u03b8 is the angle which the wavevector\nk makes w.r.t. +x. All the basic information about the wave have to do with one cycle\nof oscillation when:\n\u03c6 \u2192 \u03c6 + 2\u03c0 as x \u2192 x + \u2206x and t \u2192 t + \u2206t.\n\n(3)\n\nDenoting any possible variations in the \u2206's by the \u03b4's, we have:\n0 = \u03b4\u03c6 = \u03c9\u03b4t \u2212 kcos\u03b8\u03b4x + \u2206t\u03b4\u03c9 \u2212 \u2206x\u03b4(kcos\u03b8)\n\n(4)\n\nEq (4) embodies the manner by which space-time fluctuations lead to limitations in our\nknowledge of the wave properties. To elucidate this, we examine the simplest case \u03b8 = 0,\nand note that the angular frequency is by definition \u03c9 = 2\u03c0/\u2206t where \u2206t refers to the\ntime interval (cf. the aforementioned \u03c4 ) satisfying Eq (3) in the limit of vanishing space\ninterval, \u2206x = 0, during which Eq (4) reduces to \u03b4\u03c9/\u03c9 = \u2212\u03b4t/\u2206t + cos\u03b8(\u03b4x/c\u2206t). The\nlimiting \u03c9 uncertainty\n\u221a\n\u221a is obtained, by treating (\u03b4t, \u03b4x) as independent random errors of\nmagnitude ( 2\u03c3t , 2c\u03c3t ), to be:\n1\n\u03c3t \u03c92\n\u03c3\u03c9 = \u221a (1 + cos2\u03b8) 2 ,\n2\u03c0\n\n(5)\n\nor simply \u03c3\u03bd /\u03bd \u223c \u03bd\u03c3t , as before.\nLikewise, the quantity kcos\u03b8, defined as = 2\u03c0/\u2206x where \u2206x refers to the value satisfying Eq. (3) in the case \u2206t = 0. Thus, using again Eq (4) and arguments similar to\nthose which follow this equation lead to the result:\n\u03c3kcos\u03b8 =\n\n1\n\u03c3t \u03c92|cos\u03b8|\n\u221a\n(1 + cos2\u03b8) 2\n2\u03c0c\n\n(6)\n\nwhere in deriving Eq (6) it is also assumed that a real (on-shell) photon satisfying \u03c9/k = c\nis detected in our laboratory.\n4\n\n\fOnce the original data of \u03a3 are Lorentz transformed to the \u03a3\u2032 frame the frequency\nwill assume a value \u03c9 \u2032 given by:\n\u03c9 \u2032 = \u03b3[\u03c9 \u2212 v(kcos\u03b8)]\n\n(7)\n\nFrom the foregoing treatment it is plain that our laboratory 'energy-momentum' measurements of \u03c9 and (kcos\u03b8), like those of t and x, must be regarded as independent. Thus\nwhen \u03c9 \u2032 is inferred from \u03c9 and kcos\u03b8 by means of Eq (7), the result carries an error \u03c3\u03c9\u2032\nof magnitude:\n\u03c3\u03c9\u2032\n\n1\n\u03b3\u03c92\u03c3t\nv2\n= \u03b3(\u03c32\u03c9 + v2\u03c32kcos\u03b8 ) = \u221a\n(1 + cos2\u03b8) 2 1 + cos2\u03b8(1 + cos2\u03b8)\nc2\n2\u03c0\n\n\u0014\n\n1\n2\n\n\u00151\n\n2\n\n,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere the final form of Eq (8) was obtained with the help of Eqs (5) and (6). Then it\nfollows from Eq (7) that:\n\u03c3\u03c9\u2032\n\u03c9\u03c3t\nvcos\u03b8\n\u221a\n=\n1\n\u2212\n\u03c9\u2032\nc\n2\u03c0\n\n!\u22121\n\n(1 + cos2\u03b8)\n\n1\n2\n\n\u0014\n\nv2\n1 + cos2\u03b8(1 + cos2\u03b8)\nc2\n\n\u00151\n2\n\n(9)\n\nWe now apply our results to the special case of \u03b8 = 0 (\u03a3\u2032 moving relative to \u03a3 in the\nsame direction as the photon wavevector) and v \u2192 c (\u03b3 \u226b 1) Eqs (7) and (9) simplify to:\n\u221a\n\u03c9\n\u03c3\u03c9\u2032\n2 3\n\u2032\n\u03c9 =\nand\n=\n\u03b32\u03c9\u03c3t\n(10)\n2\u03b3\n\u03c9\u2032\n\u03c0\nAs can be seen in Eq (10), there is an accuracy deterioration when the measurement of \u03a3\nis referred to a frame \u03a3\u2032 where the frequency \u03c9 \u2032 is \u226a \u03c9. More precisely, upon comparison\nof Eq (10) with Eq (5) it is apparent\nthat \u03c3\u03c9\u2032 /\u03c9 \u2032 exceeds the relative error \u03c3\u03c9 /\u03c9 intrinsic\n\u221a\nto raw data of \u03a3 by a factor 2 3\u03b32. It is also important to assess the ultimate quality of\nany measurement directly performed aboard \u03a3\u2032 . Had such been available, one would have\nrepeated the reasoning which led to Eq (5), with (\u03c9 \u2032 , \u03b8\u2032 = 0) now replacing (\u03c9, \u03b8 = 0),\nto conclude upon a relative error \u223c \u03c9 \u2032 \u03c3t /\u03c0 = \u03c9\u03c3\u221a\nt /(2\u03c0\u03b3), which is less than that of the\ntransformed data of \u03a3, Eq (10), by the factor 4 3\u03b33. This means what we believe as\nthe frequency seen by observer \u03a3\u2032 could differ very substantially from the actual value\nwitnessed by that observer. In fact, Eq (10) indicates that the point at which we cannot\nmeaningfully predict \u03c9 \u2032 using our laboratory measurement of \u03c9 occurs when:\n\u03c3\u03c9\u2032\n\u223c \u03b32\u03c9\u03c3t \u2265 1.\n\u03c9\u2032\n\n(11)\n\nA similar calculation reveals that in the limit of Eq (11) the 'momentum' parameter\nk \u2032 cos\u03b8\u2032 will also undergo large excursions (yet correlated with those of \u03c9 \u2032).\nFurther, the argument can be repeated, with similar conclusions, to a situation where\nthe energy of an ultra-relativistic particle is measured in the laboratory frame \u03a3 and transformed to the particle rest frame \u03a3\u2032 . For the purpose of calculating intrinsic uncertainties,\nthe laboratory 4-momentum (E, p) of such a particle may be treated in the same way as\n5\n\n\f1\n\nthat of the photon h\u0304(\u03c9, k), with an on-shell relation2 of E = (p2 c2+m2 c4) 2 \u2248 pc(\u226b mc2).\nThen the transformed energy E \u2032 carries a relative uncertainty \u221a\n\u03c3E \u2032 /E \u2032 which likewise exceeds that of the original measurement of \u03a3, viz. \u03c3E /E, by 2 3\u03b32 times. Again, analogous to Eq (11), our own data become irrelevant towards predicting actual rest frame\nexperiences when:\n\u03b32E\u03c3t\n\u03c3E \u2032\n\u223c\n\u2265 1.\n(12)\n\u2032\nE\nh\u0304\nWhen the limit given by Eq (12) is reached the particle energy E \u2032 fluctuates substantially\nabout mc2. Here and beyond, a key identifying characteristic of the particle, viz. its rest\nmass, ceases to be meaningful, nor can one assign a special status to the rest frame.\nWe now consider two applications. In each case presented, we point out the interesting\nphenomenon of an observational anomaly occurring at a parameter regime where the effect\ndiscussed in this paper is non-negigible. We then provide a qualitative yet compelling\nargument to explain why the anomaly may be a manifestation of quantum space-time.\nTo proceed, a value for the basic parameter \u03c3t is necessary. As discussed earlier, it makes\nsense to adopt the Planck time tP \u2248 5.4 \u00d7 10\u221244 s as a conservative estimate.\nOur first example concerns the laboratory frame detection of \u223c 25 TeV (\u03c9 \u223c 4 \u00d7 1028\nHz) gamma rays from the blazar Mkn 501 (Aharonian et al 1999). This is an unexpected\nresult: the gamma radiation should have severely been attentuated by photons from the\nisotropic infra-red background which exists along the intervening line-of-sight, because of\npair production in the center-of-mass frame \u03a3\u2032 where both photon populations appear to\nbe > 1 MeV in energy and undergoing essentially head-on collisions.\nNote however a caveat in the logic: while all the relevant data are collected only aboard\nthe \u03a3 frame the interaction between 25 TeV and infra-red photons has never directly been\nstudied experimentally in any detail from this frame. Rather, we simply relied on L to\navail ourselves a view of the situation from frame \u03a3\u2032 where the physics of the interaction\nbecomes well established but the input parameters for the two colliding photons assume\nvalues as derived from the transformed data of \u03a3. To scrutinize the performance of L, let\nus focus on the \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c9 \u2032 operation. Since the two frames are connected by a Lorentz factor\nof \u03b3 > 107, subsitution of the above value of \u03c9 and \u03c3t \u2248 tP into Eq (11) reveals that\n\u03c3\u03c9\u2032 /\u03c9 \u2032 > 0.2, i.e. intrinsic uncertainties in the transformed energy of the original gamma\nrays have become significant. Thus, with respect to \u03a3\u2032 , those 1 MeV photons from the\nblazar may assume quite different energies than our prediction based upon the laboratory\ndata and L. Owing to the sensitivity of the pair production rate to input energies (\nparticularly the presence of a low energy threshold, below which the reaction cannot\nproceed) we can no longer insist that the process has necessarily played the expected\nrole in attenuating the source radiation. In fact it is obvious that when h\u0304\u03c9 \u223c 25 TeV\nthe photon can be transmitted without undergoing pair production (because its actual\nenergy in frame \u03a3\u2032 turns out to be sub-threshold). Moreover the probability of such an\n2\n\nThe relative error in the E \u2248 pc approximation is O(1/\u03b32) for \u03b3 \u226b 1. As long as this is \u226a the relative\nerror in E caused by space-time fluctuations, viz. \u03c3E /E \u223c E\u03c3t /h\u0304 (which is the case in our example of a\n1020 eV proton) the approximation is valid.\n\n6\n\n\foccurence increases as as h\u0304\u03c9 exceeds 25 TeV.\nIn our second example attention is drawn to an expected cutoff in the cosmic ray\n(CR) spectrum at energies above E = 1020 eV, as when this laboratory frame energy\nmeasurement is transformed along with the cosmic microwave background measurements\nto \u03a3\u2032 , the rest frame of the particle (presumed to be a proton), the familar scene of\nphoto-pion production becomes apparent (Greisen 1966). In reality, no such cutoff was\nobserved (e.g. Takeda et al 1998). Note, however, that the relevant Lorentz factor here is\n\u03b3 \u223c 1011 , and if we substitute such a value of \u03b3 and the above value of E into Eq (12) we\nwill arrive at \u03c3E \u2032 /E \u2032 \u223c 1014 . Such an absurd uncertainty renders obsolete any theoretical\nexpectations of the fate of the particle which is based upon a Lorentz transformation to\nthe rest frame (another manner of expression is to say that because the rest frame cannot\nat all be identified the incident photon energy in this frame is unknown). Certainly 50 %\nof the particles can avoid an interaction: for these particles the energy of the microwave\nphoton relative to \u03a3\u2032 is below the pion production threshold. Moreover, the colossal value\nof \u03c3E \u2032 prevents any modification of our conclusion even when multiple in-situ interactions\nand the improbable scenario of \u03c3t < tP are invoked.\nFor very high energy cosmic rays we wish to inquire the value of the 'critical energy'\nEc beyond which the notion of a unique rest frame is no longer tenable. By means of\nEq (12), one readily deduces that Ec \u2248 2 \u00d7 1015 eV for protons, and \u2248 3 \u00d7 1013 eV for\nelectrons.\nAn earlier work (Lieu 2001) presented a plausibility argument for the existence of space\nand time units which vary randomly both in magnitude and direction, by showing that\nsuch a model can interpret relativity as the macroscopic (aggregate) behavior of a microscopic ensemble. The above discussion provides a direct means of testing (a) the existence\nof Planck scale space-time fluctuations and (b) the validity of the Principle of Relativity\nas applied to ultra-relativistic speeds. If both hypotheses are upheld the reaction rates for\nthe two processes considered should exhibit an anomaly in the forementioned situations.\nThe gamma ray and cosmic ray data gathered to date suggest that the said anomaly is\nindeed in place.\nIt is also worth mentioning that the phenomenon discussed has implications on the\ntheory of General Relativity. Since in the framework of this theory gravity is a sequence\nof local Lorentz frames \u03a3\u2032 moving at varying speeds relative to the laboratory frame \u03a3,\nour everyday perception of physical laws are to be applied to \u03a3\u2032 and then transformed to\n\u03a3 - a transformation which again exaggerates the space-time uncertainties beyond their\nPlanck scale values. Effectively this means that space and time in a gravitation field must\nfluctuate more severely than the levels given by lP and tP . Obviously the consequences\nin the case of strong fields are very interesting.\nAuthor thanks W.I. Axford and Y. Takahashi for helpful discussions.\nReferences\n7\n\n\fAbramovici, A. et al, Phys.
