Its applications\nrange from micro- to macro-scales, including models of\naerodynamics structures, near-field scanning microscopy\n[6] and the measurement of gravity accelerations [7]. The\ncentral goal of interferometry is to estimate phases with\nthe highest possible confidence [8, 9, 10] while taking into\naccount sources of noise. Recent technological advances\nmake it possible to reduce or compensate the classical\nnoise to the level where a different and irreducible source\nof uncertainty becomes dominant: the quantum noise.\nGiven a finite energy resource, quantum uncertainty principles and back reactions limit the ultimate precision of\na phase measurement. In the standard configuration of\nthe MZ interferometer, a coherent optical state with an\naverage number of photons n\u0304 = |\u03b1|2 enters input port\na and the vacuum enters input port b, as illustrated in\nFigure (1). The goal is to estimate the value of the phase\nshift \u03b8 after measuring a certain number of photons Nc\nand Nd at output ports c and d, which, in the experiment discussed in this Letter, is made possible by two\nnumber-resolving photodetectors.\nThe conventional phase inference protocol estimates\nthe true value of the phase shift \u03b8 as [11, 12, 13]:\n\u0010M \u0011\np\n\u0398est = arccos\n,\n(1)\nn\u0304\nPp\n(k)\n(k)\nwhere Mp = k=1 (Nc \u2212 Nd )/p is the photon number\ndifference detected at the output ports, averaged over p\nindependent measurements. The phase uncertainty of\nestimator (1) is\n1\n\u2206\u0398 = \u221a\n,\np n\u0304 sin \u03b8\n\n(2)\n\nwhich follows from a linear error propagation theory.\nEq.(2) predicts an optimal working point at a phase shift\n\u03b8 = \u03c0/2, where the average photon number difference\nvaries most quickly with phase. As \u03b8 approaches 0 or \u03c0,\nthe confidence of the measurement becomes very low and\n\nFIG. 1: (a) Schematic of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. A\nphase sensitive measurement is provided by the detection of\nthe number of particles Nc and Nd at the two output ports.\n(b) Pulse height distribution for a visible light photon counter\n(VLPC) used in the experiment. The power incident on the\ndetector is 144 fW at a wavelength of 780 nm. The vertical\nlines show the decision thresholds [23].\n\neventually vanishes. As a consequence, this interferometric protocol does not allow the measurement of arbitrary\nphase shifts. This can be a serious drawback for applications like laser gyroscopes, the synchronization of clocks,\nor the alignment of reference frames. Furthermore, to estimate small phase shifts with the highest resolution, the\ninterferometer has to be actively stabilized around \u03c0/2.\nThis generally requires the addition of a feedback loop,\nwhich can be quite costly in terms of time and energy\nresources.\nIt was first noticed by Yurke, McCall and Klauder\n(YMK) in [14] that the estimator (1) does not take into\naccount all the available information, and, in particular,\nthe fluctuations in the total number of photons at the\noutput ports. The possibility to improve Eq.(2) is confirmed by the analysis of the Cramer-Rao lower bound\n(CRLB) [15, 16], which provides, given an input state\nand choice of observables, the lowest uncertainty allowed\nby Quantum Mechanics.\nFor a generic, unbiased, estimap\ntor, \u2206\u0398CRLB = 1/ pF (\u03b8), where F (\u03b8) is the Fisher information [17], which, in general, can depend on the true\nvalue of the phase shift \u03b8 and the number of independent\n\n\f2\n0.4\n\nA\n\n0.2\n\n(i)\n\n0.1\n\nB\n\n0.3\n\nPp ( \u03c6 | {Nc , Nd } i=1...p )\n\n0.1\n0\n\n0\n0.5\n\n0.3\n\nD\n\nC\n\n0.4\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n0\n\n(i)\n\nprobability distribution\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n0\n1\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n\u03c6/\u03c0\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n0.8\n\nA\n\n0.8\n\n0.4\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0\n5\n4\n\n0\n\nC\n\n1\n\nD\n\n12\n\n3\n\n8\n\n2\n\n4\n\n1\n0\n0\n\n\u03c6/\u03c0\n\nB\n\n1.2\n\n0.6\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n\u03c6/\u03c0\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n\u03c6/\u03c0\n\nFIG. 2: (color online).

A direct calculation of the Fisher information for the coherent \u2297 vacuum input state, gives\nF (\u03b8) = n\u0304. Therefore, the Cramer-Rao lower bound is\n\nvides both an estimate on the phase and the uncertainty\nin this estimate.\nThere are several advantages to using a Bayesian protocol. Notably, it can be applied to any number p of\nindependent measurements, it does not require statistical convergence or averaging, and it provides uncertainty\nestimates tailored to the specific measurement results.\nFor instance, with a single measurement, p = 1, it predicts an uncertainty that scales as \u2206\u0398 \u2248 \u221aN 1+N . Since\nc\nd\nEq.(4) does not depend on n\u0304, the estimation is insensitive\nto fluctuations of the input laser intensity. Most importantly, its uncertainty, in the limit p >> 1, is \u2206\u0398 = \u221a1p n\u0304\nwhich coincides with the CRLB.\nTo implement the proposed protocol we have realized a polarization Mach-Zehnder interferometer with\nphoton-number-resolving coincidence detection. In a recent paper we reported on the analysis of a coherent\nstate using a single photon-number-resolving detector\n[23]. We have extended this experimental capability to\ntwo simultaneously operating visible light photon counters (VLPCs) [24], cryogenic photodetectors that provide\na current pulse of approximately 40,000 electrons per detected photon. The VLPCs were maintained at 8 K in a\nhelium flow cryostat, and their photocurrent was amplified by low-noise, room temperature amplifiers. We measured a detection efficiency of 35% and a dark count rate\nof 3 \u00d7 105 for each detector under our operating conditions. Custom electronics processed the amplified VLPC\ncurrent pulses to perform gated, fast coincidence detection. We were thus able to determine, for each pulse, how\nmany photons were detected at both ports c and d. A\nTi:sapphire pulsed laser, attenuated such that n\u0304 = 1.08\nphotons, provided the input state. Since a coherent state\nmaintains its form under linear loss [11], the presence of\nloss after the interferometer is completely equivalent to\na lossless interferometer fed by a weaker input state. We\nuse n\u0304 to signify the average number of photons in the\ndetected state per pulse, after all losses. We were limited by the amplifiers to measuring up to four photons\n\n1\n\u2206\u0398CRLB = \u221a ,\np n\u0304\n\n(3)\n\nwhich, in contrast with the result of Eq.(2), is independent of the true value of the phase shift. The only assumption here is that the observable measured at the output ports is the number of particles. It is well known (see\nfor instance [18]) that the Maximum Likelihood (ML)\nestimator, defined as the maximum, \u0398ML , of the Likelihood function P (Nc , Nd |\u03c6) (see below), saturates the\nCRLB, but only asymptotically in the number of measurements p. In the current literature there have been\nalternative suggestions to obtain an unbiased estimator and a phase independent sensitivity with a MachZehnder interferometer [10, 14, 19, 20, 21]. They will be\nspecifically addressed at the end of this Letter.\nHere we develop a protocol based on a Bayesian\nanalysis of the measurement results [8, 9, 18,\n19].\nThe goal is to determine P (\u03c6| Nc , Nd ),\nthe probability that the phase equals \u03c6 given\nthe measured Nc and Nd .\nBayes' theorem provides this: P (\u03c6|Nc , Nd ) = P (Nc , Nd |\u03c6) P (\u03c6)/P (Nc , Nd ),\nwhere P (Nc , Nd |\u03c6) is the probability to detect Nc and\nNd when the phase is \u03c6 [22], P (\u03c6) quantifies our prior\nknowledge about the true value of the phase shift, and\nP (Nc , Nd ) is fixed by normalization. Assuming no prior\nknowledge of the phase shift, P (\u03c6) = 1/\u03c0. In the ideal\ncase, the Bayesian phase probability distribution can be\ncalculated analytically for any value of Nc and Nd ,\n\u0010\n\u03c6 \u00112Nd\n\u03c6 \u00112Nc \u0010\nsin\n,\nP (\u03c6|Nc , Nd ) = C cos\n2\n2\n\n(4)\n\nc )\u0393(1/2+Nd )\nwhere C = \u0393(1/2+N\nis a normalization con\u0393(1+Nc +N d)\nstant.

The result \u03c3est \u226b (\u03b8 \u2212 \u0398est )\nproves that our protocol provides an unbiased experimental\nphase estimation.\n\nper pulse Fig. 1(b), but at n\u0304 = 1.08 the probability of\ndetecting five or more photons is negligible. The phase\nshift \u03b8 was changed by tilting a birefringent crystal inside\nthe interferometer.\nThe first part of the experiment consists of the calibration of the interferometer. At different, known, values\nof the phase shift, we measured Nc and Nd for each of\n200, 000 laser pulses. This procedure allows us to determine experimentally both P (Nc , Nd |\u03c6) and P (\u03c6|Nc , Nd ).\nIn Fig.(2) we compare the ideal and the experimental\nphase distributions. The agreement is quite good, and\nthe discrepancies can be attributed to imperfect photonnumber discrimination by the detectors. To fit the data\nin Fig.(2), we introduce the probability P (Nc , Nd |Nc\u2032 , Nd\u2032 )\nto measure Nc and Nd when Nc\u2032 and Nd\u2032 photons were really present. Taking this into account, the experimental\nphase probability distribution is\nPfit (\u03c6|Nc , Nd ) =\n\nX\n\nNc\u2032 ,Nd\u2032\n\nP (\u03c6|Nc\u2032 , Nd\u2032 )P (Nc\u2032 , Nd\u2032 |Nc , Nd ),\n\n(5)\nwhere P (\u03c6|Nc\u2032 , Nd\u2032 ) are the ideal probabilities Eq.(4). The\nweights P (Nc\u2032 , Nd\u2032 |Nc , Nd ) can be retrieved from a fit of\nthe experimental calibration distributions P (\u03c6|Nc , Nd ),\nsee Fig.(2). The quantity P (Nc , Nd |Nc , Nd ), equal to one\nin the ideal case, is 0.54 in Fig.(2A) (corresponding to\nthe worst case among all distributions), 0.67 in (2B) and\n(2C), and 0.87 in (2D).\nAfter the calibration, we can proceed with the\nBayesian phase estimation experiment. For a certain\nvalue of the phase shift, we input one laser pulse and\ndetect the number of photons Nc and Nd . We repeat\nthis procedure p times obtaining a sequence of indepen(i)\n(i)\ndent results {Nc , Nd }i=1...p . The p photon-number\nmeasurements comprise a single phase estimation. The\noverall phase probability is given by the product of the\n\n0\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n\u03b8/\u03c0\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nFIG. 5: (color online).

Since the average number of\nphotons of the coherent input state is small, for p \u223c 1 the\nphase uncertainty is of the order of the prior knowledge,\n\u2206\u0398 \u2243 \u03c0. As p increases, the probability distribution be\u221a\ncomes Gaussian and the sensitivity scales as \u2206\u0398 \u221d 1/ p,\nin agreement with the central limit theorem.\nIn Fig.(4), we show the difference between the mean\nvalue of the phase estimator h\u0398est i, obtained from 150\nphase estimations, each with p = 1000, and the true value\nof the phase shift. The bars are the mean square fluctuation. The important result is that our protocol provides\nan experimentally unbiased phase estimation over the entire phase interval.\nThe main result of this Letter is presented in Fig.(5).\nWe show the phase sensitivity for different values of the\nphase shift \u03b8, calculated from the distribution Eq.(6)\nwith p = 1000 photon-number measurements. The\ncircles are the mean value of \u2206\u0398, and the bars give\nthe corresponding mean square fluctuation, obtained\nfrom 150 independent phase measurements. The dashed\nblue line is the CRLB calculated withpthe experimental probability distributions, \u2206\u03b8fit = 1/ pFfit (\u03b8), where\nP\n\u2202Pfit (N1 ,N2 |\u03b8) 2\n1\nFfit (\u03b8) =\n) [26].

Around\n\u03b8 = 0, \u03c0, where the photons have higher probability to\nexit through the same output port, \u2206\u03b8fit increases as a\nconsequence of the decreased sensitivity of our detectors\nto higher photon number states. Even though the phase\nsensitivity of our apparatus becomes worse near \u03b8 = 0, \u03c0,\nit never diverges. Triangles show the phase uncertainty\nobtained with Eq.(1), but taking into account the experimental noise. The estimator is obtained by inverting\nthe equation Mp = n\u0304 cos(a + \u03b8) + b [25]. This strategy\nprovides an unbiased estimation with a sensitivity close\nto the one predicted by Eq.(2) (dotted red line). The\nreason for the superior performance of the Bayesian protocol can be understood by noticing that, in Eq.(2), the\nphase estimate is retrieved only from the measurement\nof the photon number difference, which, simply does not\nexploit all of the available information.\nIn [14] YMK first proposed a generalization of the\nestimator Eq.(1) to take into account the whole information in the output measurements. Their estimator,\n\u0398YMK = arccos[(Nc \u2212 Nd )/(Nc +\u221aNd )], gives a phase independent sensitivity, \u2206\u0398 = 1/ Nc + Nd . Notice that\n\u0398YMK coincides with the Maximum Likelihood estimator in the ideal, noiseless, MZ interferometer. However,\nit is not obvious how to generalize \u0398YMK for real interferometry, where classical noise is present and the YMK\nestimator is different from \u0398ML . In general, because of\ncorrelations between Nc \u2212 Nd and Nc + Nd , this estimator becomes strongly biased in the presence of noise as\nwe have verified using our experimental data [27]. Moreover, the YMK estimator cannot be extended when both\ninput ports of the interferometer are illuminated. Conversely, the Bayesian analysis holds for general inputs\nand, in particular, it predicts a phase-independent sensitivity when squeezed vacuum is injected in the unused\nport of the MZ [27], which reaches a sub shot-noise sensitivity [13]. It should be noted that detection losses again\nbecome important when attempting to use nonclassical\nlight to overcome the shot-noise limit Eq.(3).\nIn [19], Hradil et al. used a Bayesian approach for\na Michelson-Morley neutron interferometer (single output detection) and discussed theoretically the MZ. Their\nanalysis was based on specific assumptions about the interferometric classical noise which are not satisfied in the\ncase discussed in this Letter. Different approaches with\nadaptive measurements [20] and positive operator value\nmeasurements [10] have been also suggested. While these\nstrategies might be important for interferometry at the\nHeisenberg limit, they are not necessary in our case.\nIn conclusion, we have presented a Bayesian phase estimation protocol for a MZ interferometer fed by a single\ncoherent state. The protocol is unbiased and provides\na phase sensitivity that saturates the ultimate CramerRao uncertainty bound imposed by quantum fluctuations. We have been able to implement the protocol\nwith two photon-number-resolving detectors at the out-\n\nput ports of a weakly-illuminated interferometer. Yet,\nthe method can be generalized to the case of high intensity laser interferometry and photodiode detectors. In\nthis case, the limit Eq.(3) becomes harder to achieve because of larger electronic noise and lower photon number\nresolution, however it should still be possible to demonstrate a phase independent sensitivity. Our results are of\nimportance to quantum inference theory and show that\nthe MZ interferometer does not require phase-locking in\norder to reach an optimal sensitivity.\nAcknowledgment.
