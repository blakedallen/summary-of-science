The combination of the first two ingredients\nmakes the theory equivalent to a model in classical statistical\nmechanics: indeed, in Euclidean space a path integral for the\nquantum theory is equivalent to a thermodynamic average for\nthe corresponding statistical mechanical system. For QCD,\nthe square of the bare coupling constant g0 of the field theory\ncorresponds directly to the temperature 1/\u03b2 of the statistical\nmechanical model.\nThe third ingredient - the lattice discretization - represents an ultraviolet regularization. In fact, the lattice spacing a corresponds to a high-momentum cutoff, since momenta\nhigher than \u223c 1/a cannot be represented on the lattice. In this\nway the ultraviolet divergences, appearing in the calculation\nof physical quantities, are suppressed and the theory is well\ndefined. Of course, in order to recover the continuum-space\ntheory we must take the limit a \u2192 0. In this process it is necessary to \"tune\" the bare parameters of the theory in such a\nway that physical quantities converge to finite values, which\ncan then be compared to experiment. In particular, in the limit\na \u2192 0, a correlation length \u03be measured in units of the lattice\nspacing, i.e. \u03be/a, must go to infinity. In other words, the lattice theory considered must approach a critical point, i.e. a\nsecond-order phase transition. Thus, the study of the continuum limit in quantum field theories on the lattice is analogous to the study of critical phenomena in statistical mechanics. The correspondence between Euclidean field theories and\nclassical statistical mechanics allows the application of usual\nstatistical-physics methods to the study of QCD. In particular, one may perform numerical simulations by Monte Carlo\nmethods, which are based on a stochastic description of the\nsystems considered [3].\nDespite the similarity of the methods, the Monte Carlo simulation of gauge theories is much more complex than in the\ncase of the usual statistical mechanical models, requiring great\ncomputational effort and specific numerical techniques for the\nproduction of the data. Moreover, we must consider three limits in order to obtain the desired physical results from the simulation data: 1) the infinite-volume limit (or thermodynamic\nlimit), 2) the continuum limit (i.e. the value of a must be sufficiently small when compared to the relevant distance for the\nproblem) and 3) the chiral limit (in order to consider physical\nvalues for the masses of the light quarks). The above limits\nare not independent, since to get to the continuum limit and\nto be able to consider small masses for the quarks one needs\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe strong force - one of the four fundamental interactions of nature along with gravity, electromagnetism and the\nweak force - is the force that holds together protons and\nneutrons in the nucleus. The strong interaction is described\nby Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) [1]. This description\nis based on a model of elementary particles - the quarks\n- possessing \"color charge\" and interacting through the exchange of gauge fields - the gluons (equivalent to the photons in the electromagnetic interaction). QCD is a quantum\nfield theory, with local SU(3) gauge symmetry, corresponding to three possible colors. The fact that the gauge group\nof QCD is non-Abelian implies that the gluons possess color\ncharge and therefore interact with each other, as opposed to\nthe photons. The only parameters of the theory are the masses\nof the various types (called \"flavors\") of quarks considered\nand the value of the strong coupling constant.\nA unique feature of the strong force is that the particles\nthat feel it directly - quarks and gluons - are completely\nhidden from us, i.e. they are never observed as free particles.\nThis phenomenon, known as confinement, makes QCD much\nharder to handle theoretically than the theories describing the\nweak and electromagnetic forces. Indeed, the coupling constant \u03b1s of the strong interaction becomes negligible only in\nthe limit of small distances, or equivalently in the limit of high\nenergy or momentum. This property is called asymptotic freedom. At larger distances (i.e. smaller energies) there is an increase in the intensity of the interaction and it is believed that\nthe force of attraction between quarks is constant, for sufficiently large distances, determining the confinement of quarks\nand gluons inside the hadrons. The fact that \u03b1s is not negligible at low energies makes the study of important phenomena such as the mechanism of quark and gluon confinement,\nthe hadron mass spectrum and the deconfining transition at\nfinite temperature inaccessible to calculations using perturbation theory. These phenomena must therefore be studied in a\nnonperturbative way.\nThe nonperturbative study of QCD is possible in the lattice\nformulation of the theory, introduced by Wilson in 1974 [2].\nThis formulation offers a convenient nonperturbative regularization, preserving the theory's gauge invariance. The essential ingredients for the lattice formulation are: 1) path-integral\nquantization, 2) continuation to imaginary or Euclidean time\n0\n\n\f1\na sufficiently large number of lattice points (corresponding to\na small enough lattice spacing and to a large enough physical\nsize of the lattice), which increases considerably the computational effort.\nThe study of lattice QCD constitutes a so-called Grand\nChallenge computational problem [4]. Indeed, simulations\nof full QCD - i.e. including effects of dynamical fermions\n- for quark masses in the region of physical values are\nstill extremely slow and they are in general carried out\non supercomputers, involving the effort of large collaborations such as the UKQCD in the United Kingdom and the\nJLQCD in Japan. Also, several research groups have built\nQCD-dedicated computers, using parallel architecture. Examples are the Hitachi/CP-PACS machine at the University\nof Tsukuba in Japan [5], the QCDSP and QCDOC machines at\nColumbia University in the USA [6], and the APE machines\n[7] at various research centers in Europe. These computers\nrange from about 1 to 10 teraFLOPS. In addition to these\nlarge projects, many groups base their simulations on clusters of workstations or personal computers (PC's) [8]. These\nsystems do not yet provide the same efficiency in parallelization as the machines with parallel architecture, but their cost\nis much lower. In addition to the computational power, the\nnumerical and analytical techniques used in the simulations\nand in the interpretation of the produced data are of great importance in the field. Significant progress has been achieved\nthrough the development of more efficient simulation algorithms, new methods for interpolation and extrapolation of\nthe numerical data and a better understanding of the systematic effects to which the simulation may be subject, such as\nfinite-volume effects and discretization errors. Progresses in\nthe field are reported annually at the Lattice conference [9].\nDespite the great computational difficulty, numerical studies of QCD have already provided important contributions to\nthe study of the strong force [10]. In particular, numerical\nsimulations of QCD are now able to produce calculations of\nthe strong coupling constant \u03b1s (\u03bc0 ), taken at a fixed reference\nscale \u03bc0 , with precision comparable to the experimental one or\nbetter [11]. These results are presently included in the world\naverage for this quantity [12]. Also, the mass spectrum of the\nlight hadrons (including the two light quarks and the strange\nquark) has been determined (with great precision) [13] for the\nquenched case, in which the configurations are produced without considering effects of dynamical quarks. One does not\nobtain complete agreement with the experimental spectrum,\nbut the observed discrepancies are of at most 10%. Similar\ncalculations are now being performed for the full-QCD case.\nFinally, lattice simulations constitute the only known evidence\nfor the quark-deconfining transition at finite temperature [14]\nand its predictions are of direct interest for the current experiments in search of new states of matter in the laboratories\nBrookhaven and CERN.\nThere is presently great interest in the results of the simulations described above and one hopes to be able to solve many\ntheoretical questions about QCD and the standard model\n[15]. Indeed, lattice-QCD simulations are now able to provide quantitative predictions with errors of a few percent.\nThis means that these simulations will soon become the main\n\nsource of theoretical results for comparison with experiments\nin high-energy physics [16], enabling a much more complete\nunderstanding of the physics of the strong force.\n\nA. Lattice QCD at the IFSC\u2013USP\n\nSince the beginning of 2001 we have been carrying out a\nproject on numerical simulations of lattice gauge theories at\nthe Physics Department of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo in S\u00e3o\nCarlos (IFSC\u2013USP), funded by FAPESP [17]. The project\nincluded the installation of 2 PC clusters (with a total of 28\nprocessing nodes). The resulting computer power is of approximately 40 gigaFLOPS for peak performance. We have\nperformed production runs since July of 2001 and have started\nintensive parallel simulations in November 2002. Our main\nresearch topic (see Sections II\u2013VII below) is the investigation\nof the infrared behavior of various propagators and vertices in\nLandau gauge with the goal of verifying the so-called GribovZwanziger confinement scenario [18, 19]. In order to reduce\nthe computational cost of the simulations, we consider the\npure SU(2) gauge theory, including studies in three (instead\nof the usual four) space-time dimensions.\nBesides the topics described below, we also carry out numerical studies of: gauge-fixing algorithms [20], Gribov-copy\neffects [21], the chiral phase transition of QCD with two dynamical fermions [22], the equation of state of spin models\nwith Goldstone modes [23], cluster percolation [24] and shorttime dynamics for spin models [25].\n\nII.\n\nCONFINEMENT SCENARIOS IN LANDAU GAUGE\n\nAs said above, the study of the infra-red (IR) limit of QCD\nis of central importance for understanding the mechanism of\nconfinement and the dynamics of partons at low energy. Despite being non-gauge-invariant, gluon and ghost propagators\nare powerful tools in the (non-perturbative) investigation of\nthis limit [26, 27]. In fact, according to the Gribov-Zwanziger\n[18, 28, 29] and to the Kugo-Ojima [30] confinement scenarios in Landau gauge, the ghost propagator must show a divergent behavior in the IR limit - stronger than p\u22122 - for vanishing momentum p. This strong IR divergence corresponds\nto a long-range interaction in real space, which may be related to quark confinement. At the same time, according to\nthe former scenario, the gluon propagator must be suppressed\nand may go to zero in the IR limit [18, 28, 29, 31]. This would\nimply that the real-space gluon propagator is positive and negative in equal measure, i.e. reflection positivity is maximally\nviolated [32, 33]. As a consequence, the Euclidean 2-point\nfunction cannot represent the correlations of a physical particle. This result may be viewed as an indication of gluon\nconfinement [26].\nThese theoretical predictions have been confirmed by studies using Dyson-Schwinger equations (DSE's) [26, 27]. In\nparticular, studies of DSE's in Landau gauge have found\n[34, 35, 36] an IR behavior of the form G(p) \u223c p\u22122\u03ba\u22122 =\np\u22122aG \u22122 for the ghost propagator and of the form D(p) \u223c\n\n\fp4\u03ba\u22122 = p2aD \u22122 for the gluon propagator with the same exponent \u03ba (i.e. with aG = aD /2). In 4d one usually finds \u03ba & 0.5\nfor pure SU(Nc ) gauge theory. Note that \u03ba > 0.5 implies\nD(0) = 0. For the 3d case the exponents are aG \u2248 0.4 and\naD \u2248 1.3. Note that in the d dimensional case [34, 35] the\nrelation between aD and aG is given by aD = 2aG + (4 \u2212 d)/2,\nimplying for the quantity \u03b1s (p) = (g2 /4\u03c0)D(p)G2(p)p6 the\nIR behavior p2(aD \u22122aG ) = p4\u2212d . Thus, in the 4-dimensional\ncase the running coupling \u03b1s (p) displays and IR fixed point.\nNumerical studies of lattice gauge theories confirm the IR\ndivergence of the Landau ghost propagator [21, 37, 38] and\nan IR suppression of the gluon propagator. More precisely, a\ndecreasing gluon propagator at small momenta has been obtained for the 3d SU(2) Landau case using very large lattices\n[39] and - recently - in the 4d SU(3) Landau case with the\nuse of asymmetric lattices [40]. Similar results has also been\nobtained for the the equal-time three-dimensional transverse\ngluon propagator in 4d SU(2) Coulomb gauge [41]. In this\nlast case, one also obtains an excellent fit of the transverse\npropagator by a Gribov-like formula. Finally, direct support\nto the Gribov-Zwanziger and to the Kugo-Ojima scenarios has\nbeen presented in [42] and in [43], respectively.\nThus, the two nonperturbative approaches above seem to\nsupport the Gribov-Zwanziger and the Kugo-Ojima confinement scenarios in Landau gauge. However, the agreement between the two methods is still at the qualitative level. Moreover, recent lattice studies [44, 45] seem to indicate a null IR\nlimit for \u03b1s (p), instead of a finite nonzero value. At the same\ntime, a study based on DSE's [46] showed that torus and continuum solutions are qualitatively different. This suggests a\nnontrivial relation between studies on compact and on noncompact manifolds and could have important implications for\nlattice studies. Also, the nonrenormalizability of the ghostgluon vertex - proven at the perturbative level [47], confirmed on the lattice [45, 48] (for p & 200 MeV) and used\nin DSE studies to simplify the coupled set of equations -\nhas been recently criticized in Ref. [44]. Thus, clear quantitative understanding of the two confinement scenarios is still an\nopen problem.\n\nIII.\n\nINFINITE-VOLUME LIMIT\n\nThe study of the IR behavior of propagators and vertices,\ni.e. for momenta smaller than 1 GeV, requires careful consideration of the infinite-volume limit. Indeed, since the smallest non-zero momentum that can be considered on a lattice\nis given by pmin \u2248 2\u03c0/L - where L is the size of the lattice\nin physical units - it is clear that one needs to simulate at\nvery large lattice sizes in order to probe the small-momentum\nlimit. The consideration of very large lattice sizes requires\nparallelization and high efficiency of the code in order to obtain good statistics in the Monte Carlo simulation. Thus, an\noptimized parallel code is of great importance [49]. Our numerical code is parallelized using MPI; for the random number generator we use a double-precision implementation of\nRANLUX (version 2.1) with luxury level set to 2.\n\na D(p) / Z(a) (GeV-1)\n\n2\n1.2\n1.15\n1.1\n1.05\n1\n0.95\n0.9\n0.85\n0.8\n0.75\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\np/a (GeV)\n\nFIG. 1: Plot of the rescaled gluon propagator aD(0)/Z(a) as a function of the momentum for V = 803 and \u03b2 = 4.2 (\u00d7), 5.0 (\u0003), 6.0 (\u2666).\nError bars are obtained from propagation of errors.\n\nA. Very large lattice side\n\nIn Ref. [39] we have evaluated the lattice gluon propagator\nD(k) and study it as a function of the momentum p(k) in the\n3d SU(2) Landau case, using data from the largest lattice side\nto date, i.e. up to 1403. This allowed us to consider momenta\nas small as 51 MeV (in the deep IR region) and physical lattice\nsides almost as large as 25 fm.\nIn order to compare lattice data at different \u03b2's, we apply the\nmatching technique described in [50], i.e. the propagators are\nmultiplied by a factor Z(a) depending on \u03b2 or, equivalently,\non the lattice spacing a. The method works very well (see\nFig. 1); indeed, data obtained using different \u03b2 values nicely\ncollapse into a single curve. We find that the gluon propagator decreases in the IR limit for momenta smaller than pmax ,\nwhich corresponds to the mass scale M in a Gribov-like propagator D(p) = p2 /(p4 + M 4 ). From the plot we can estimate\n\u221a\n+100\npmax = M = 0.8+0.2\n\u22120.1 \u03c3 = 350\u221250 MeV, in agreement with\nRef. [51]. (Here \u03c3 is the string tension.)\nIn Fig. 2 we plot the rescaled gluon propagator at zero momentum, namely aD(0)/Z(a), as a function of the inverse lattice side L\u22121 = 1/(aN) in physical units (fm\u22121). We see that\naD(0)/Z(a) decreases monotonically as L increases, in agreement with Ref. [52]. It is interesting to notice that these data\ncan be well fitted using the simple Ansatz d + b/Lc both with\nd = 0 and d 6= 0 (see Figure 2). In order to decide for one\nor the other result one should go to significantly larger lattice\nsizes.\nAlso, in Ref. [39] we have shown that the data for the gluon\npropagator are well fitted by Gribov-like formulae, yielding\nan IR critical exponent \u03ba \u2248 0.65 in agreement with recent analytic results (see Section II). Recently [53] we have extended\nthis analysis to the ghost propagator, considering lattice volumes up to 803 for the coupling \u03b2 = 4.2. A fit to the data\nusing the fitting function b/pa (in the interval p \u2264 0.5 GeV)\ngives a = 2.40(2). This result would imply aG \u2248 0.4, also in\nagreement with the results reported in Section II above.\n\n\f3\nB. Asymmetric lattices\n\na D(0) / Z(a) (GeV-1)\n\nRecently, very asymmetric lattices [40, 54] have been considered in order to explore the IR limit od QCD. As a test\nof this method, we have extended [55] the gluon propagator\nstudy presented in [39] [for the 3d SU(2) case in minimal\nLandau gauge], by including results for the ghost propagators\nfrom very large lattices. At the same time, we evaluated the\npropagators using also asymmetric lattices, in order to verify\npossible systematic effects related to the use of asymmetric\nlattices (as suggested in [45]), by comparing the results to the\nones obtained for symmetric lattices.\nWe find, for both propagators, clear evidences of system\u221a\natic effects at relatively small momenta, i.e. p . 1.5 \u03c3 \u2248\n650MeV. In particular, the gluon (respectively, ghost) propagator is less suppressed (respec. enhanced) in the IR limit\nwhen considering asymmetric lattices than for the case of\nsymmetric lattices (see Fig. 3). This implies that the estimates for the IR critical exponents aG and aD are systematically smaller in the asymmetric case compared to the symmetric one.\nAlso, for the gluon propagator and considering the asymmetric lattices, one would estimate a value M . 0.25/a \u2248 0.22\nGeV as a turnover point in the IR, i.e. the momentum pmax =\nM for which the propagator reaches its peak. On the other\nhand, considering the largest (symmetric) lattice volumes, i.e.\nV = 1403 (see the top plot in Fig. 3), the gluon propagator is\nclearly a decreasing function of p for p . 0.5/a, corresponding to M . 0.435 GeV. This is in agreement with the result\nreported in Section III A above. We thus see a difference of\nalmost a factor 2 between the momentum-turnover point in the\nsymmetric and asymmetric cases.\nFinally, we have seen that the extrapolation to infinite volume of results obtained using asymmetric lattices is also most\nlikely affected by systematic errors. We conclude that, even\n\nFIG. 3: Plot of the gluon propagator D(p) (top) and of the ghost\npropagator G(p) (bottom) as a function of p for lattice volumes V =\n82 \u00d7 140 (\u00d7), 122 \u00d7 140 (\u0003), 162 \u00d7 140 (\u2666) and V = 1403 ( ). All\nquantities are in lattice units. Note the logarithmic scale on the y axis\nin the bottom plot. Errors represent one standard deviation.\n\nthough using an asymmetric lattice does not modify the qualitative behavior of the two propagators, one should be careful\nin extracting quantitative information from such studies.\n\n1.2\n1\n0.8\n\nIV. REFLECTION-POSITIVITY VIOLATION\n\n0.6\n\nThe relation between reflection positivity and Euclidean\ncorrelation functions can be made explicit by considering the\nspectral representation [26, 56]\n\n0.4\n0.2\n\nD(p) =\n\nZ \u221e\n\ndm2\n\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\n\n0.2\n1/L (fm-1)\n\nFIG. 2: Plot of the rescaled gluon propagator at zero momentum as\na function of the inverse lattice side.

Then, the\nstatement of reflection positivity is equivalent to a positive\nspectral density \u03c1(m2 ).

Errors have been evaluated\nusing bootstrap with 1000 samples. All quantities are in lattice units.\n\nClearly, a positive density \u03c1(\u03c92 ) implies that C(t) > 0 . Notice that having C(t) positive for all t does not ensure the positivity of \u03c1(\u03c92 ). On the other hand, finding C(t) < 0 for some t\nimplies that \u03c1(\u03c92 ) cannot be positive, suggesting confinement\nfor the corresponding particle.\nOn the lattice, the real-space propagator can be evaluated\nusing\nC(t) =\n\n1 N\u22121 \u22122\u03c0 ik0t/N\ne\nD(k0 , 0) ,\nN k\u2211\n=0\n\n(3)\n\n0\n\nwhere N is the number of points per lattice side and D(k) is\nthe propagator in momentum space. If the lattice action satisfies reflection positivity [57], then we can write the spectral\nrepresentation\nC(t) = \u2211 rn e\u2212Ent ,\n\nFIG. 5: Fit of C(t) as a function of t (in f m) using a sum of two\nGribov-like propagators for lattice volume V = 1403 and coupling\n\u03b2 = 4.2. We also display the two Gribov-like propagators separately.\n\n\u221a\n438 MeV = 0.995 \u03c3, where \u03c3 is the string tension. Let us\nalso recall that the momentum-space Gribov-like propagator has its maximum at pmax = M (see Section III A above).\nMoreover, we find that finite-size effects seem to become\nimportant only at t & 3 f m. This means that our data for\nt \u2208 [0, 3] f m are essentially infinite-volume continuum results.\nIn the scaling region, the data are well described by a sum\nof Gribov-like\nformulas (see Fig. 5), with a light-mass scale\n\u221a\nm \u2248 0.74 \u03c3 = 325 MeV .\nIt has been suggested [60, 61] that the violation of spectral\npositivity in lattice Landau gauge be related to the quenched\nauxiliary fields used for gauge fixing. We note that the fitting\nform proposed for C(t) in [61] describes reasonably well our\ndata \u221a\nup to t = 3 f m - yielding a light-mass scale of about\n1.14 \u03c3 = 500 MeV - but cannot account for the oscillatory\nbehavior observed at very large separations.\n\n(4)\n\nn\n\nwhere rn are positive-definite constants. Clearly, this implies\nthat C(t) is non-negative for all values of t.\nNumerical indications of a negative real-space lattice Landau gluon propagator have been presented in the 3d SU(2)\ncase [58], in the magnetic sector of the 4d SU(2) case at finite\ntemperature [59] and, recently, in the 4d SU(3) case for one\n\"exceptional\" configuration [33].\nUsing data from the largest lattice sides to date, we verify explicitly (in the 3d case) [32] the violation of reflection\npositivity for the SU(2) lattice Landau gluon propagator (see\nFig. 4). In particular, the propagator becomes negative at\nt \u2248 0.7 f m and the minimum is reached at tmin \u2248 1 f m (see\nFig. 5). Note that the Gribov-like propagator\n\u221a\n\u0013\n\u0012\ne\u2212Mt/ 2\n\u03c0\nMt\nC(t) =\n(5)\ncos \u221a +\n2M\n4\n2\n\u221a\nhas its minimum at tmin = \u03c0/(M \u221a\n2 ). Thus, the above result for tmin would imply M \u2248 \u03c0/ 2 f m\u22121 \u2248 2.22 f m\u22121 =\n\nV.\n\nGHOST-GLUON VERTEX\n\nIn the framework of quantum field theory, Faddeev-Popov\nghosts are introduced in order to quantize non-Abelian gauge\ntheories. Although the ghosts are a mathematical artifact and\nare absent from the physical spectrum, one can use the ghostgluon vertex and the ghost propagator to calculate physical\nobservables, such as the QCD running coupling \u03b1s (p), using\nthe relation\n\u03b1s (p) = \u03b10\n\nZ3 (p) Ze32 (p)\n.\nZe2 (p)\n\n(6)\n\n1\n\nHere \u03b10 = g20 /4\u03c0 is the bare coupling constant and Z3 (p),\nZe3 (p) and Ze1 (p) are, respectively, the gluon, ghost and ghostgluon vertex renormalization functions. The above formula\ngets simplified if one considers the Landau gauge. Indeed,\nin this case the vertex renormalization function Ze1 (p) is finite\n\n\f5\n\nFIG. 6: Results for Ze1\u22121 (p) for the lattice volume V = 164 as a\nfunction of p = p\u0302/a in GeV, considering symmetric momenta, i.e.\nwith 4 equal components. We show data obtained using two different gauge-fixing methods (with and without the so-called smearing\nmethod [64]). Error bars were evaluated using the bootstrap method\nwith 250 samples.\n\nand constant, i.e. independent of the renormalization scale p,\nat least to all orders of perturbation theory [47, 62]. Of course,\nit is important to verify in a non-perturbative way that this result really holds. If it does, one can consider in the Landau\ngauge a definition of the running coupling constant that requires only the calculation of the gluon and ghost propagators\n[63].\nIn Refs. [48] we have studied the reduced ghost-gluon vertex function \u0393\u03bcabc (0, p) and the renormalization function Ze1 (p)\nin minimal Landau gauge at the asymmetric point (0; p, \u2212p)\nin the SU(2) case. We find that the vertex function has the\nsame momentum dependence of the (lattice) tree-level vertex\n- i.e. \u223c p\u0302 cos(\u03c0 pea/L) \u223c sin(2 \u03c0 pea/L) - and that Ze1 (p) is\napproximately constant and equal to 1, at least for momenta\np & 1 GeV (see Fig. 6). This is a direct non-perturbative verification of the perturbative result reported above. In particular,\nusing the result obtained at the largest value of \u03b2 considered\n(i.e. \u03b2 = 2.4) we obtained Ze1\u22121 (p) = 1.02+6\n\u22127 , where errors include Gribov-copy effects and discretization errors related to\nthe breaking of rotational invariance.\nRecently, this study has been extended (in the 3d case) [65]\nto other kinematical configurations, including in particular the\nsymmetric point p2 = q2 = k2 . We find that the vertex is essentially constant and of order one, for all momentum configurations (see Fig. 7), confirming the results obtained in the\n4d case [45, 48]. This result is also in agreement with predictions from functional methods in the 3d case [66]. In the\nsame reference we also present the first numerical study of the\nLandau-gauge three-gluon vertex in the 3d case and results for\nthe spectrum of the Faddeev-Popov operator, which plays an\nimportant role in the Gribov-Zwanziger scenario [18, 28, 67].\n\nFIG. 7: The scalar quantity Gcc\u0304A (q, k, \u03c6), defined in Eq. (27) of Ref.\n[65], as a function of the magnitude of the incoming anti-ghost momentum q. Full symbols correspond to \u03b2 = 4.2 and open symbols to\n\u03b2 = 6.0; circles are used for V = 203 and triangles for V = 303 . We\nplot data for the case with the three momenta equal.\n\nIn particular we have shown that (see Fig. 7 in Ref. [65])\nthe smallest non-zero eigenvalue of the Faddeev-Popov matrix goes to zero when the infinite-volume limit is approached.\nAs a consequence, in the continuum limit, the average lattice\nLandau configuration should belong to the first Gribov horizon, supporting the Gribov-Zwanziger mechanism of confinement (see also [42]).\n\nVI. GHOST CONDENSATES\n\nThe QCD vacuum is known to be highly non-trivial at\nlow energies [68]. This non-trivial structure manifests itself\nthrough the appearance of vacuum condensates, i.e. vacuum\nexpectation values of certain local operators. In perturbation theory these condensates vanish, but in the SVZ-sumrule approach [69] they are included as a parametrization of\nnon-perturbative effects in the evaluation of phenomenological quantities. The two main such operators are \u03b1s F\u03bc\u03bd F \u03bc\u03bd and\nmq \u03c8q \u03c8q ; their vacuum expectation values are the so-called\ngluon and quark condensates. Both of these operators have\nmass dimension four.\nIn recent years, (gauge-dependent) condensates of mass dimension two have also received considerable attention [29,\n70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82]. In particular, the gauge condensate hAb\u03bc Ab\u03bc i has been largely studied, since it should be sensitive to topological structures such\nas monopoles [70] and it could play an important role in\nthe quark-confinement scenario through monopole condensation [83]. Moreover, the existence of a gauge condensate\nwould imply a dynamical mass generation for the gluon and\nghost fields [29, 71]. Possible effects of the gauge condensate hAb\u03bc Ab\u03bc i on propagators and vertices (in Landau gauge)\nhave been studied through lattice simulations in Refs. [44, 84],\n\n\f6\nyielding hAb\u03bc Ab\u03bc i \u2248 3 GeV2 .\nOther vacuum condensates of mass dimension two considered by several groups are the ghost condensates. These\ncondensates were first introduced in SU(2) gauge theory in\nmaximally Abelian gauge (MAG) [72, 73, 74, 85]. More\nrecently, the same condensates have been studied in other\ngauges [75, 76], such as the Curci-Ferrari and the Landau\ngauges. In all cases it was found that the ghost condensates\nare related to the breakdown of a global SL(2, R) symmetry\n[26, 76]. In MAG the diagonal and off-diagonal components\nof the ghost propagators are modified [72, 77] by ghost condensation. Similar results have been obtained in other gauges\n[75, 78]. In particular, in Landau gauge it was shown [78] that\nthe off-diagonal (anti-symmetric) components of the ghost\npropagator Gcd (p) are proportional to the ghost condensate\nv.\nFinally, a mixed gluon-ghost condensate of mass dimension\ntwo has also been studied by several authors [73, 75, 79, 80,\n81], using various gauges. This mixed condensate is of particular interest when considering interpolating gauges [80]. Indeed, it allows to generalize and relate results obtained in different gauges for the gauge condensate hAb\u03bc Ab\u03bc i and the ghost\ncondensates. Moreover, in MAG this mixed condensate would\ninduce a dynamic mass for the off-diagonal gluons [81], giving support to the Abelian-dominance scenario [86]. Thus, the\nvarious gauge and ghost condensates could all play an important role in the dual superconducting scenario of quark confinement [87], being related to monopole condensation and to\nAbelian dominance.\nIn Ref. [88] we carried out a thorough investigation of ghost\n\ncondensation in the so-called Overhauser channel for pure\nSU(2) Yang-Mills theory in minimal Landau gauge. In particular, we evaluate numerically the off-diagonal components\nof the ghost propagator Gcd (p) as a function of the momentum p. We find that h\u03c6b (p)i = \u03b5bcd hGcd (p)i/2 is zero within\nerror bars, but with large fluctuations. At the same time, we\nsee clear signs of spontaneous breaking of a global symmetry,\nusing the quantity \u03c6b (p) as an order parameter. As in the case\nof continuous-spin models in the ordered phase (see for example [89]), spontaneous symmetry breaking is supported by two\n(related) observations: 1) by comparing the statistical fluctuations for the quantities \u03c6b (p) and |\u03c6b (p)|; 2) from the nonGaussian shape of the statistical distribution of \u03c6b (p), which\ncan be observed by considering a histogram of the data or by\nevaluating the so-called Binder cumulant (see Fig. 8). Since,\nin Landau gauge, the vacuum expectation value of the quantity \u03c6b (p) should be proportional (in the Overhauser channel)\nto the ghost condensate v [78], it seems reasonable to conclude\nthat the broken symmetry is the SL(2, R) symmetry, which is\nrelated to ghost condensation [26, 76]. This interpretation has\nbeen recently criticized in Ref. [90]. There, the nonzero value\nobtained for the Binder cumulant has been explained by considering multi-dimensional Gaussian distributions and a modified definition for the Binder cumulant. We note however\nthat the order parameter considered in our study, i.e. the magnitude of \u03c6b (p), is a scalar quantity. Therefore, in analogy\nwith studies of O(N)-vector models (see for example [91]),\nthe standard definition of the Binder cumulant should apply to\nour study as well.\nLet us note that, from our data, the Binder cumulant U\nseems to be approximately null at small lattice volume and to\nconverge to a value U \u2248 0.45 for physical lattice side L & 15\nGev\u22121 \u2248 3 fm, corresponding to a mass scale of less than 100\nMeV.\nIn Ref. [88] we have also shown that the sign of \u03c6b (p) is\nrelated to the sign of the Fourier-transformed gluon field come\nponents A(q)\nand that \u03c6b (p) has discretization effects similar\nto those obtained for the ghost-gluon vertex [48]. Then, using the rescaled quantity | L2 \u03c6b (p)/ cos(\u03c0 p\u0303a/L) |, we find (at\nsmall momenta) a behavior p\u2212z with z \u2248 4, in agreement with\nanalytic predictions [78]. On the other hand, from our fits\nwe find that the ghost condensate v is consistent with zero\nwithin error bars, i.e. the quantity | L2 \u03c6b (p)/ cos(\u03c0 p\u0303a/L) |\ndoes not approach a finite limit at small momenta, at least for\np \u2265 0.245 GeV.

More precisely, our data rule out values of v greater\nthan 0.058 GeV2 \u2248 (240 MeV)2 but would still be consistent with a ghost condensate v . 0.025 GeV2 \u2248 (160 MeV)2 .\nLet us note that, in analytic studies [73, 78, 82, 92] one finds\nthat the ghost\u221acondensate induces a tachyonic gluon mass proportional to v, which modifies the dynamic gluon mass related to the gauge condensate hAb\u03bc Ab\u03bc i. Thus, one should expect a relatively small ghost condensate v in order to obtain\na global (non-tachyonic) gluon mass.

A similar mass scale was also obtained in numerical studies of the\ngluon propagator in Landau gauge [32, 39, 51].\n\nVII.\n\nRUNNING COUPLING\n\nOf great importance for phenomenological purposes is the\nrunning coupling strength \u03b1s (p) [63] defined in Eq. (6) above.\nIn particular, this quantity enters directly the quark DysonSchwinger equation (DSE) and can be interpreted as an effective interaction strength between quarks [94]. Let us note that,\nworking in Landau gauge and in the momentum-subtraction\nscheme, the running coupling (6) can be written as [63]\n\u03b1s (p) = \u03b10 F(p) J 2 (p) ,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere F(p) and J(p) are, respectively, the gluon and the ghost\nform factors and we used the result Ze1 (p) = 1. As explained\nin Sec. II above, studies using DSE's have found that, if the IR\nsum rule 2aG \u2212 aD = 0 is satisfied, then this running coupling\ndevelops a fixed point in the IR limit (see for example [35])\nlim \u03b1s (p) = \u03b1c = constant,\n\np\u21920\n\n(9)\n\nwith \u03b1c \u2248 8.92/Nc in the SU(Nc ) case for \u03ba \u2248 0.596.\nThis quantity has been studied numerically by several\ngroups (see for example [33, 44, 95]). In Ref. [96] we have\nevaluated this running coupling constant and tried a fit to the\ndata using the fitting function\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03b1s (p) = C p4 / (p4 + m) s(a)\n(10)\n\nwhere s(a) = (11/24\u03c02) log [1 + (p2/\u039b2 )a ].

All quantities are in lattice units\n(here a \u2248 1 GeV\u22121 ). Errors represent one standard deviation. The\nlarger value at p = 0 is probably due to an insufficient number of\ngauge-fixing iterations.\n\n24\u03c02C\u039b4 /11m. Also, this fitting functions satisfies the leading ultraviolet behavior \u223c 1/ log [(p2 /\u039b2 )] for the running\ncoupling. Results are reported in Fig. 9; we find a = 1.9(3)\nand \u03b1c = 24\u03c02C\u039b2 /11m \u2248 4.6, in agreement with the result\nreported above. Similar results have also been obtained in\n[38]. We stress that in Refs. [38, 96] we have compared results obtained using two slightly different lattice formulations,\nyielding consistent results in all cases considered.\nAs said in Section II above, recent lattice studies [44, 45]\nseem to indicate a null IR limit for \u03b1s (p), instead of a finite nonzero value \u03b1c . We should stress, however, that in\nthese studies special care must be taken in order to eliminate\nfinite-size effects, especially when the IR region is considered. Indeed, we know that, if the the gluon propagator is\nnot suppressed at small momenta, the true infrared regime is\nsurely not reached yet. This is a difficult numerical task since\nwe have checked that in the 4d SU(2) case a lattice volume\nV = 524 at \u03b2 = 2.2, corresponding to a physical lattice side of\nabout 10 fm, is still not sufficient to show a decreasing propagator in the limit of small momenta (see Fig. 10). We note\nthat in Fig. 1 of [44] and in Fig. 3 of [45] the running coupling starts to decrease for a momentum p \u2248 0.5 GeV. Thus,\nfrom our discussion in Section III A above, considering the results shown in Fig. 10 and also the results reported in [50, 52],\nwe can say that the data considered in [44, 45] for momenta\np . 500 MeV are most likely affected by strong finite-size\neffects.\n\nVIII. CONCLUSIONS\n\nThe Gribov-Zwanziger and the Kugo-Ojima confinement\nscenarios in Landau gauge are well supported, at the qualita-\n\n\f8\ntive level, by several studies based on different analytical and\nnumerical approaches. On the other hand, as we have shown\nhere, a comprehensive analysis of these confinement scenarios at the quantitative level using lattice numerical simulations\ncould represent a very challenging task.\n\ntado de S\u00e3o Paulo (FAPESP) (under grant # 00/05047-5).\nPartial support from Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento\nCient\u0131\u0301fico e Tecnol\u00f3gico (CNPq) is also acknowledged.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe authors thank the organizers for the invitation.
