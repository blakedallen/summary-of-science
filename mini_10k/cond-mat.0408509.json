The high value of dielectric\nconstant at lower frequencies is shown to be due to the barrier layer\nformation. The resistivity of the PFN-xPT ceramics, obtained by\ncomplex impedance analysis, initially decreases with temperature and\nthen shows an upward trend beyond the ferroelectric Curie point\nreminiscent of BaTiO3 based thermistors with PTCR effect.\nKeywords:\n\nBarrier Layer; PTCR; Diffuse Ferroelectric Transition.\n\nINTRODUCTION:\nIt is well known that the donor-doped BaTiO3 ceramics exhibit an\nanomalous increase in resistivity by 3 to 7 orders of magnitude near the\nferroelectric Curie point. This behaviour is commonly known as\npositive temperature coefficient of resistivity (PTCR) [1]. The PTCR\neffect is utilized in thermistors, which have many technological\napplications such as temperature sensor, fluid flow and liquid level\nsensors and power regulators in electronic circuits. Besides doped\n\n\f2\n\nBaTiO3, PTCR effect is also observed in several other ferroelectric\nmaterials like KNbO3 [2], NaBiTi2O6 [3] and KBiTi2O6 [3]. PTCR effect\nhas also been reported in Pb(Fe1/2Nb1/2)O3 (PFN), which exhibits a\ndiffuse non relaxor type transition [3,4]. Recently we [5] studied the effect\nof PbTiO3 (PT) substitution on the structure and dielectric behaviour of\nPFN. It was shown that the high dielectric constant of these mixed (1-x)\nPb(Fe1/2Nb1/2)O3-xPbTiO3 (PFN-xPT) ceramics at low frequencies is\ndue to the formation of barrier layers. The barrier layer formation was\nshown to be independent of the pyrochlore phase content. It was also\nshown that with increasing PT content, or decreasing sintering\ntemperature the barrier layer effect is diminished. In the present work,\nwe have studied the temperature dependence of real and imaginary\nparts of the dielectric constant (\u03b5\u2032, \u03b5\u2032\u2032) and impedance (Z\u2032, Z\u2032\u2032) of PFN0.13PT ceramics sintered at 1200 \u00b0C. It is shown that the resistivity of\nthese ceramics exhibits negative temperature coefficient (NTC) up to\nthe Curie point after which it shows positive temperature coefficient\n(PTCR effect). The redox reactions responsible for the PTCR effect are\ndiscussed.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL:\nMulti-step mixed oxide route was used for the synthesis of PFN-xPT\npowders the details of which are described elsewhere [5]. The powders\nwere sintered at 1200 \u00b0C in closed PbO atmosphere with about 1.8%\ngain in weight after sintering. The pyrochlore phase content after\nsintering was found to be 0.6% as estimated using the relative\nintensities of the pyrochlore 222 and perovskite 110 peaks. For the\ndielectric and impedance measurements, the surface of sintered pellets\nwas first gently polished with 0.25\u03bcm diamond paste and then silver\npaste was applied on both sides of the pellets. The pellets were dried at\n100 \u00b0C in an oven and then cured by firing at 500 \u00b0C for about 10\nminutes. High temperature dielectric measurements and impedance\nanalysis were carried out using an LCR meter (Hioki 3532 LCR\nHitester). Temperature was recorded using an Indotherm programmable\ntemperature controller and chromel alumel thermocouple with an\naccuracy of \u00b11 \u00b0C. The impedance analysis was carried out using ZPlot software provided by Solartron.\n\n\f3\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION:\nFig. 1 shows the variations of real (\u03b5\u2032) and imaginary (\u03b5\u2032\u2032) parts of the\ndielectric constant with temperature at various frequencies for PFN0.13PT. It is evident from this figure that the phase transition is very\ndiffuse and shows very strong frequency dispersion at all temperatures.\nHowever it does not correspond to a relaxor ferroelectric behaviour\nsince the peaks in \u03b5\u2032 and \u03b5\u2032\u2032 occur at the same Curie point which is\nfrequency independent also. For relaxors, the two peak temperaturs are\nnon-coincident and both are frequency dependent [6,7,8]. Thus the\ndielectric response shown in Fig. 1 is due to a non-relaxor type diffuse\nferroelectric transition.\n\n4\n\n\u03b5' (x 10 )\n\n20\n15\n\n100Hz\n1kHz\n10kHz\n100kHz\n1MHz\n\n10\n\n150\n\n\u03b5 ''\n\u03b5 ''\n\u03b5 ''\n\u03b5 ''\n\u03b5 ''\n\n(b)\n\n120\n\n4\n\n\u03b5'\n\u03b5'\n\u03b5'\n\u03b5'\n\u03b5'\n\n(a)\n\n\u03b5'' (x 10 )\n\n25\n\n5\n\n90\n\n100Hz\n1kHz\n10kHz\n100kHz\n1MHz\n\n60\n30\n\n0\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n0\n\n250\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\no\n\nTemperature ( C)\n\nFIGURE 1, Variation of the (a) real (\u03b5') and (b) imaginary (\u03b5'') parts\nof dielectric constant of 0.87PFN-0.13PT sintered at 1200 oC with\ntemperature in the frequency range 100Hz -1MHz.\n10\n8\n4\n\n\u03b5' (x 10 )\n\nThe measured dielectric\nconstant decreases to rather very\nlow values for frequencies greater\nthan 10kHz as shown in Fig.2 at\nroom temperature. Such a drastic\ndecrease in the value of the\ndielectric constant at higher\nfrequencies can be explained in\nterms\nof\nthe\ninterfacial\npolarization.\nInterfacial\npolarizability results due to the\ndifference in the conductivity of\nthe grains and the grain\n\n6\n4\n2\n0\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1000\n\nFrequency (kHz)\n\nFIGURE 2, Variation of room\ntemperature dielectric constant\nwith frequency.\n\n\f4\n\nboundaries. This difference in the conductivity arises due the loss of\noxygen during sintering and its reintake during cooling at the grain\nboundaries. The semiconducting behaviour of the grains in PFN\nceramics is believed to be due to the loss of oxygen during firing at\nhigher temperatures in accordance with the reaction [9] (1) where all the\nspecies are written in accordance with Kr\u00f6ger Vink notation of defects.\nElectrons released in reaction (1), may be captured by Fe3+ leading to\nthe formation of Fe2+ according to the reaction (2).\nOo\n\n\u21d4\n\n1\nO2 +Vo\u2022\u2022 + 2e/,\n2\n\nFe3+ + e/ \u2192 Fe2+\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\nThis leads to hopping of electrons between the Fe2+ and the Fe3+ ions,\nand increases the conductivity [9]. During cooling after sintering, the\nreverse reaction of (1)\noccurs.\nBut\ndue\nto\ninsufficient time available\nduring cooling and the\nfalling temperature, the\nreoxidation process is\nrestricted to the grain\nboundaries only[10] which\nrestores the insulating\nbehaviour to the grain\nboundary regions only.\nThe grain-grain boundary\ninterface layer is usually\ncalled as 'barrier layer'. In\norder to confirm the\nformation of barrier layers\nin\nthe\nPFN-0.13PT\nceramics,\nwe\nhave\nanalyzed the complex\nimpedance using ColeCole impedance plots. Fig.\n3 (a-f) depicts the Cole- FIGURE 3, Cole-Cole impedance plots for\nCole impedance plots at 0.87PFN-0.13PT at various temperatures\nvarious\ntemperatures (a) 25 \u00b0C (b) 100 \u00b0C (c) 130 \u00b0C (d) 140 \u00b0C\nbelow and above the Curie (e) 210 \u00b0C (f) 240 \u00b0C\n\n\f5\n\n\u03c1(\u03a9-m)\n\npoint. Cole-Cole plots in Fig. 3(a-e) clearly show the presence of two\ndepressed circles. These two circles represent the contributions of\ngrains and the grain boundaries and confirm the formation of barrier\nlayers [10] responsible for the extremely high dielectric constant in PFNxPT. There was no contribution from the electrode-specimen interface,\nas the third circle on low frequency side was not observed. The two\ncircles in the Cole-Cole plot merge into one circle with increasing\ntemperature as can be seen from Fig. 3(f) for 240 \u00b0C. The relaxation\ntimes for the two polarization processes representing the grain and the\ngrain boundary contributions seem to change in different fashion\nbecause of the difference in their activation energies. However, at\nhigher temperatures both the processes seem to have comparable\nrelaxation time giving rise to one semicircle in the Cole-Cole plots.\nFigure 4. shows the variation in\n1600\nthe resistivity with temperature, as\nobtained from the intersection of the\n1200\nlower frequency semicircle with the Z\u2032\n800\naxis shown in Fig. 3. The resistivity is\nfound to decrease with increasing\n400\ntemperature upto 125 \u00b0C and exhibits a\nnegative temperature coefficient of\n0\n0\n50 100 150 200 250\nresistivity (NTC effect). Beyond the\no\nTemperature ( C)\nCurie point, the resistivity increases\nwith increasing temperature and shows\na positive temperature coefficient of\nFIGURE 4, Variation of the\nresistivity (PTCR effect). Unlike doped\nresistivity of 0.87PFN-0.13PT\nBaTiO3 ceramics, where the PTC\nwith temperature.\nresistivity jumps by 3 to 7 orders of\nmagnitude, the effect here is rather very\nweak and the increase is by only one order of magnitude. This may be\ndue to the difference in the schottky barrier height '\u03c6' [11; 12] formed at\nthe grain boundaries for BaTiO3 and PFN-0.13PT ceramics,\n\u03c6 =\n\nN D d 2e 2\n,\n2\u03b5 r \u03b5 o\n\n(3)\n\nThe barrier height depends on the width of the depletion layer (d),\ndonor concentration (ND) due to oxygen vacancies in the grains and the\ndielectric constant (\u03b5r). The resistance per square centimeter of the\nbarrier is proportional to exp (\u03c6 / KT) [11,12,13]. If \u03c6 is small, PTCR jump\n\n\f6\n\nwould also be small. Further studies are in progress to modify the\nbarrier height (\u03c6) in PFN-xPT ceramics so as to get larger PTCR jump.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nA high value of dielectric constant is obtained at lower frequencies in\nthe PFN-0.13PT ceramics. The extremely high dielectric constant at\nlow frequencies is shown to be due to the formation of barrier layers.\nThe temperature dependence of resistivity shows PTCR behaviour due\nto the creation of oxygen vacancies in the grain during sintering at high\ntemperatures.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT:\nIt is a pleasure to acknowledge the interactions with Professor D.\nKumar, Professor Om Parkash and Dr. H.
