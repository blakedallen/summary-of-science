Given the transient nature of their observed disturbances, these galaxies probably become active in radio soon after\nthe accretion event when sufficient molecular gas agglomerates in their\nnuclei.\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nBright radio sources served as the first signposts for highly energetic\nactivity in galaxies. The nature of these galaxies, and the reason for their\nluminous radio activity, have since been subjects of detailed investigation. Although the vast majority resemble luminous elliptical galaxies,\nobservations (Smith & Heckman 1989) showed that a significant fraction of the most powerful radio galaxies at low redshifts exhibit peculiar\noptical morphologies suggestive of close encounters or mergers between\ngalaxies. Nevertheless, all of the powerful radio galaxies examined by\nSmith et al. (1990), mostly selected from the 3C catalog, lie within the\nfundamental plane of normal elliptical galaxies.\nSome radio galaxies possess so much dust that they can be detected\nin the far-infrared by IRAS. This discovery has motivated many subsequent searches for molecular gas in radio galaxies, in all cases by selecting\nthose with known appreciable amounts of dust. At low redshifts, eleven\nradio galaxies have so far been detected in 12 CO. The detected galaxies\nspan nearly three orders of magnitude in radio luminosity, and comprise those exhibiting core-dominated radio sources as well as classical\ndouble-lobed FR-I (edge darkened) and FR-II (edge brightened) radio\nsources. All have inferred molecular-gas masses between 109 M\u2299 and\n1011 M\u2299 , except for the very nearby radio galaxy Centaurus A which\nhas a molecular-gas mass of \u223c2 \u00d7 108 M\u2299 (Eckart et al. 1990). In four\nof the five cases the CO gas is found to be concentrated in a compact\n(diameter of a few kpc or smaller) ring or disk around the center of the\ngalaxy. The molecular gas in radio galaxies may therefore comprise the\nreservoir for fueling their central supermassive black holes.\nAt low redshifts, the only other type of galaxy to commonly exhibit molecular gas masses as high as \u2265 1010 M\u2299 are infrared-luminous\ngalaxies. These gas and dust rich galaxies exhibit vigorous star formation thought to be triggered by galaxy-galaxy interactions, and indeed the majority of ultraluminous infrared galaxies (i.e., those with\nL(60\u03bcm) \u2265 1012 L\u2299 ) are found to be merging systems of gas-rich disk\ngalaxies. In the latter systems, the CO gas is found to be preferentially concentrated in a ring or disk around the nuclear regions of the\nmerging galaxies (e.g Bryant & Scoville 1999). The observed similarities\nhave prompted the suggestion that radio galaxies also originate from the\nmergers of two gas-rich disk galaxies, and in many cases comprise their\nstill disturbed E/SO merger products (Mirabel et al. 1989, Evans et al.\n1999a, 1999b).\n\n\f3\nGiven the predisposition of the abovementioned surveys towards relatively dust-rich objects, are the radio galaxies so far detected biased\ntowards those with unusually large amounts of molecular gas? It is\nnot clear whether the IR-bright radio galaxies so far detected represent\nthe most gas-rich members of a population that all possess substantial\namounts of dust and gas, or extreme members of a population that possess a broad range of dust and gas masses. This issue is of importance\nfor a proper understanding of the nature of radio galaxies, and what\nfuels their supermassive black holes.\nTo address this issue, we have initiated a deep survey of all the previously undetected radio galaxies at redshifts z \u2264 0.031 in the revised 3C\ncatalog (Spinrad et al 1985). The objects in this catalog represent the\nmost luminous radio galaxies at their particular redshifts in the northern\nhemisphere. At low redshifts the vast majority can be clearly seen to be\nluminous elliptical galaxies, which in most cases comprise first ranked\ngalaxies in poor clusters of roughly ten members although a number reside in much richer environments (Zirbel 1997). Only a small minority\nhave been detected in the infrared by IRAS; indeed, only three objects\nin this catalog have previously been detected in CO, one of which lies in\nthe redshift range of our survey.\n\n2.\n\nMolecular gas\n\nOut of the 21 sources observed, 8 have been detected in 12 CO(1 \u2192 0)\nand 3 in 12 CO(2 \u2192 1) (see Table 1). The line profiles of the 12 CO(1 \u2192 0)\nand 12 CO(2 \u2192 1) emission are shown in Fig. 1. Because of the halfpower beam of the IRAM-30m, we are mainly sensitive to emission from\nthe central part of the radio-galaxies, typically the inner 10/5 kpc for the\n(1 \u2192 0)/(2 \u2192 1) transitions. We emphasize nevertheless that the CO\nbeam sizes are larger than the dust features seen in these radio-galaxies\n(Martel et al. 1999).\nThe double-horned line profile is clearly observed in 5 radio-galaxies\nand is characteristic of an inclined rotating disk with a central depression\nin CO emission at the rising part of its rotation curve (Wiklind et al.\n1997). The rotational velocities observed are quite high and if they\nare corrected for the inclination of the dust disk they reach high values\nwhich are more typical of the nuclear molecular-gas disks or rings in\nIR-luminous galaxies. Using a standard CO-to-H2 conversion factor we\nestimate the molecular content (see Table 1) within these galaxies. In\nthe case of 3C253, where we have only a detection in 12 CO (2 \u2192 1, we\ncompute the molecular mass using the mean average line ratio.\n\n\f4\n\nFigure 1.\nCO(1-0) spectra (solid line) with CO(2-1) spectra (dotted line) towards\na sample of 3CR radio galaxies detected in, at least, one of the both transition lines.\nThe vertical arrows show the optical velocity.\n\nThe line ratio of 12 CO(2 \u2192 1/12 CO(1 \u2192 0) , with the individual line\nintensities measured provides information on the opacity and excitation\nof the gas. Line ratio less than 0.7 imply that the gas has different\nfilling factor in the two transitions or is subthermally excited, whereas\nline ratio greater than unity imply that the gas is optically thin. If\nboth transitions originitate from a region comparable in size with their\nindividual dust features, as is the case in all the galaxies so far mapped\nin CO, the line ratios are between 0.6 and 0.8. These values are close to\nthe extreme upper limits measured for many inactive elliptical galaxies\n(Wiklind et al. 1995), but close to the average value of 0.9 measure at\nthe centers of both inactive and active disk galaxies (Braine & Combes\n1992).\n\n3.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe total/upper-limit molecular mass found in this 3CR sample of\nradio galaxies is well below the molecular mass found in a typical galaxy\nlike the Milky Way (several 109 M\u2299 ) for most of the case. We detected only 4 \u00d7 106 M\u2299 molecular gas in the nearby radio-galaxy 3C272.1\n(M84) and an upper-limit of 3.4 \u00d7 106 in 3C270 (M87).

On the Fig. 2 the distribution of the molecular gas mass in\nthe radio galaxies show the dichotomy bettween the IRAS-selected sample of radio-galaxies and our 3C sample: a clear cut appears at 109 M\u2299\nbetween both samples. Compared to a sample of radio-quiet elliptical\ngalaxies (Knapp & Rupen 1996, Wiklind et al. 1997) the 3C sample exhibits a statiscally significant lower gas mass content than the elliptical\ngalaxy sample.\nA possible link between Ultra-Luminous Infrared Galaxies (ULIRGs)\nand radio-galaxies has been proposed (Evans et al. 1999b). Some case\nexhibits properties that place them in both categories. The question is\nif major mergers are responsible for the AGN phase in radio galaxies.\nBy comparison with ULIRGs, however, radio galaxies exhibit a much\nbroader range of molecular gas masses. Moreover the host galaxies of\nthe 3C sample appear to be very well relaxed and lie in the fundamental plane. The timescale for relaxation after a merging is about 1-2 Gy.\nNevertheless the radio emission phase is very short, few 107 years. Given\nthe accretion rate for the AGN (< 1 M\u2299 .yr\u22121 ), only few massive GMCs\n(106 M\u2299 ) would be sufficient to fuel the AGN. Indeed in the nearby radio\ngalaxies (M84, M87) observed, the detection or upper-limit of molecular gas are lower than 107 M\u2299 . In our survey only low molecular gas\ncontent has been detected. Major mergers require radio galaxies to be\nvery old merger remnants that have only recently become active after\nthe remnant has relaxed and much of the gas disappeared. But minor\nmergers present a simpler alternative to the dust and molecular gas seen\nin many 3CR radio galaxies. Furthermore they can explain the presence\n\n\f6\nRQs\nRLs\n\nFigure 2.\nLeft: Molecular gas content vs. radiocontinuum (1.4 GHz).
