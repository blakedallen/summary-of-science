Mani Roja\nDepartment of Electronics & Telecommunication\nThadomal Shahani Engineering College\nMumbai, INDIA\n\nAbstract- In recent times, communication through the internet\nhas tremendously facilitated the distribution of multimedia data.\nAlthough this is indubitably a boon, one of its repercussions is\nthat it has also given impetus to the notorious issue of online\nmusic piracy. Unethical attempts can also be made to deliberately\nalter such copyrighted data and thus, misuse it. Copyright\nviolation by means of unauthorized distribution, as well as\nunauthorized tampering of copyrighted audio data is an\nimportant technological and research issue. Audio watermarking\nhas been proposed as a solution to tackle this issue. The main\npurpose of audio watermarking is to protect against possible\nthreats to the audio data and in case of copyright violation or\nunauthorized tampering, authenticity of such data can be\ndisputed by virtue of audio watermarking.\nKeywords- watermarking; audio watermarking; data hiding; data\nconfidentiality.\n\nI.\nINTRODUCTION\nOver the years, there has been tremendous growth in\ncomputer networks and more specifically, the internet. This\nphenomenon, coupled with the exponential increase of\ncomputer performance, has facilitated the distribution of\nmultimedia data such as images, audio, video etc. Data\ntransmission has been made very simple, fast and accurate\nusing the internet. However, one of the main problems\nassociated with transmission of data over the internet is that it\nmay pose a security threat, i.e., personal or confidential data\ncan be stolen or hacked in many ways. Publishers and artists,\nhence, may be reluctant to distribute data over the Internet due\nto lack of security; copyrighted material can be easily\nduplicated and distributed without the owner\u201fs consent.\nTherefore, it becomes very important to take data security into\nconsideration, as it is one of the essential factors that need\nattention during the process of data distribution. Watermarks\nhave been proposed as a way to tackle this tough issue. This\ndigital signature could discourage copyright violation, and may\nhelp determine the authenticity and ownership of an image.\nWatermarking is \"the practice of imperceptibly altering a\nWork to embed a message about that Work\" [1]. Watermarking\ncan be used to secretly transmit confidential messages, for e.g.,\nmilitary maps, without the fact of such transmission being\ndiscovered. Watermarking, being ideally imperceptible, can be\nessentially used to mask the very existence of the secret\nmessage [6]. In this manner, watermarking is used to create a\ncovert channel to transmit confidential information [5].\nWatermarking is an effective means of hiding data, thereby\nprotecting the data from unauthorized or unwanted viewing.\n\nWatermarking is becoming increasingly popular, especially for\ninsertion of undetectable identifying marks, such as author or\ncopyright information to the host signal. Watermarking may\nprobably be best used in conjunction with another data-hiding\nmethod such as steganography, cryptography etc. Such datahiding schemes, when coupled with watermarking, can be a\npart of an extensive layered security approach.\nTo combat online music piracy, a digital watermark could\nbe added to all recordings prior to release, signifying not only\nthe author of the work, but also the user who has purchased a\nlegitimate copy. Audio watermarking is defined as \"the\nimperceptible, robust and secure communication of data related\nto the host audio signal, which includes embedding into, and\nextraction from, the host audio signal\" [4]. Digital audio\nwatermarking involves the concealment of data within a\ndiscrete audio file. Intellectual property protection is currently\nthe main driving force behind research in this area. Several\nother applications of audio watermarking such as copyright\nprotection, owner identification, tampering detection,\nfingerprinting, copy and access control, annotation, and secret\ncommunication, are in practice. Other related uses for\nwatermarking include embedding auxiliary information which\nis related to a particular song, like lyrics, album information, or\na hyperlink etc. Watermarking could be used in voice\nconferencing systems to indicate to others which party is\ncurrently speaking. A video application of this technology\nwould consist of embedding subtitles or closed captioning\ninformation as a watermark [7].\nII.\n\nIDEA OF THE PROPOSED SOLUTION\n\nA. Process of Watermarking\nThe block diagram for watermarking is as shown below:\n\nFigure 1. General watermarking block diagram\n\nWe can summarize the entire process of hiding and\nretrieving data as follows:\n\n113 | P a g e\nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org\n\n\f(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,\nVol. 2, No. 9, 2011\n\n\uf0b7\n\nRead the data to be hidden.\n\n\uf0b7\n\nRead the cover, i.e., host, in which data is to be hidden.\n\n\uf0b7\n\nApply watermarking methods on the host.\n\n\uf0b7\n\nHide the data in the host.\n\n\uf0b7\n\nRetrieve the original data at the receiver end.\n\nIII.\n\n1) Simplicity: It is parameter-free and inexpensive to\ncompute, with a complexity of only one multiply and two\nadditions per sample. It is also memory less, i.e., MSE can be\nevaluated at each sample, independent of other samples.\n2) Clear physical meaning: It is the natural way to define\nthe energy of the error signal. Such an energy measure is\npreserved even after any orthogonal or unitary linear\ntransformation. The energy preserving property guarantees that\nthe energy of a signal distortion in the transform domain is the\nsame as that in the signal domain.\n3) Excellent metric in the context of optimization: The\nMSE possesses the properties of convexity, symmetry, and\ndifferentiability.\n4) Used as a convention: It has been extensively\nemployed for optimizing and assessing a wide variety of signal\nprocessing applications, including filter design, signal\ncompression, restoration, reconstruction, and classification.\nMSE is essentially a signal fidelity measure [14],[15]. The\ngoal of a signal fidelity measure is to compare two signals by\nproviding a quantitative score that describes the degree of\nsimilarity/fidelity or, conversely, the level of error/distortion\nbetween them. Usually, it is assumed that one of the signals is a\npristine original, while the other is distorted or contaminated by\nerrors.\nSuppose that x = {xi | i = 1, 2, . . . , N} and y = {yi | i = 1, 2,\n. . . , N} are two finite-length, discrete signals, for e.g., visual\nimages or audio signals. The MSE between the signals is given\nby the following formula:\nMSE ( x, y) \uf03d\n\n1 N\n\uf0e5 ( xi \uf02d yi )2\nN i \uf03d1\n\nWhere,\nN is the number of signal samples.\nxi is the value of the ith sample in x.\nyi is the value of the ith sample in y.\n\nAudio Watermarking can be implemented in 3 ways:\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\uf0b7\n\nB. Mean Square Error\nMean Square Error (MSE) [2], first introduced by C. F.\nGauss, serves as an important parameter in gauging the\nperformance of the watermarking system. The following\nfactors justify the choice of MSE as a convenient and extensive\nstandard for performance assessment of various techniques of\naudio watermarking:\n\n(1)\n\nIMPLEMENTATION STEPS\n\nAudio in Audio\nAudio in Image\nImage in Audio\n\nA. Audio in Audio\nIn this method, both the cover file and the watermark file\nare audio signals. The watermark signal must have fewer\nsamples as compared to those of the cover audio signal.\nFurther, this method can be implemented with the help of two\ntechniques, namely, Interleaving and DCT.\n1) Using Interleaving: It is a way to arrange data in a\nnon-contiguous way so as to increase performance [3]. The\nfollowing example illustrates the process of interleaving:\nOriginal signal:\nInterleaved signal:\n\nAAAABBBBCCCCDDDDEEEE\nABCDEABCDEABCDEABCDE\n\nIn this technique, the samples of watermark audio are\ninserted in between the samples of the cover audio file [9],[10].\nIn terms of complexity, this is the simplest method of audio\nwatermarking.\n2) Using Discrete Cosine Transform: This technique is\nbased on the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) [11]-[13]. In\nthis technique, we take the DCT of both the cover audio and\nthe watermark audio signals. Upon zigzag scanning, the high\nfrequency DCT coefficients of the cover audio file are replaced\nwith the low frequency DCT coefficients of the watermark\naudio file. During transmission, the Inverse Discrete Cosine\nTransform (IDCT) of the final watermarked DCT is taken. In\nthis particular technique, since both the host, i.e., cover and\nwatermark signal are in the audio format, we implement this\nmethod using a 1D DCT which is defined by the following\nequation:\nF (u ) \uf03d\n\n2 N \uf02d1\n\uf0e6 u (2i \uf02b 1)\uf070\nA(i) \uf02a cos \uf0e7\n\uf0e5\nN i \uf03d0\n\uf0e8 2N\n\n\uf0f6\n\uf0f7 \uf02a f (i)\n\uf0f8\n\n(2)\n\nWhere,\n\uf0ec 1\nfor u \uf03d 0\n\uf0ef\nA(i) \uf03d \uf0ed 2\n\uf0ef 1 otherwise\n\uf0ee\nf(i) is the input sequence.\n\nB. Audio in Image\nThis watermarking implementation uses DCT for\nembedding audio file in an image. Here we take DCT of both\nthe cover image and the watermark audio files. The low\nfrequency coefficients of both the DCT\u201fs are taken. The high\nfrequency coefficients of the DCT of the image are replaced\nwith the low frequency coefficients of the DCT of the\n\n114 | P a g e\nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org\n\n\f(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,\nVol. 2, No. 9, 2011\n\nwatermark audio file. During transmission, the IDCT of the\nfinal watermarked DCT is taken. This technique involves both\nan audio signal (watermark) and an image (host). Hence, we\nimplement this method using a 1D DCT for the audio signal\nand a 2D DCT for the image. Equation (2) defines a 1D DCT\nwhile the corresponding equation for a 2D DCT is defined by\nthe following equation:\nF (u, v) \uf03d\n\n2\nN\n\n2\nM\n\n\uf0e6 u (2i \uf02b 1)\uf070 \uf0f6 M \uf02d1\n\uf0e6 v(2 j \uf02b 1)\uf070 \uf0f6\n\uf0f7 \uf02a \uf0e5 A( j ) \uf02a cos \uf0e7\n\uf0f7 \uf02a f (i, j )\n2N\n\uf0f8 j \uf03d0\n\uf0e8 2M\n\uf0f8\n\nN \uf02d1\n\n\uf0e5 A(i) \uf02a cos \uf0e7\uf0e8\ni \uf03d0\n\n(3)\n\nWhere,\n\nFigure 3.

Image in Audio\nIn this implementation, as deployed previously, DCT is\nused for embedding an image in an audio file. Here we take the\nDCT of both the cover audio and the watermark image files.\nThis is followed by zigzag scanning so as to ascertain the low\nfrequency and high frequency DCT coefficients. The high\nfrequency DCT coefficients of the audio signal are replaced\nwith the low frequency DCT coefficients of the watermark\nimage file. While transmitting, the IDCT of the final\nwatermarked DCT is taken.\n\nFigure 4. Watermarked audio signal\n\nSince this method is similar to the \u201eAudio in Image\u201f\ntechnique with respect to the parameters involved, i.e., this\ntechnique also involves both an audio signal (watermark) and\nan image (host), hence, we may implement this method using a\n1D DCT for the audio signal and a 2D DCT for the image.\nEquation (2) defines a 1D DCT while, (3) defines a 2D DCT.\nIV.\n\nRESULTS\n\nA.

Recovered audio signal with Hamming Code\n\nERROR CORRECTION USING HAMMING CODES\n\nDuring transmission, when data travels through a wireless\nmedium over a long distance, it is highly probable that it may\nget corrupted due to fluctuations in channel characteristics or\nother external parameters. Hence, hamming codes, which are\nForward Error Correction (FEC) codes, may be used for the\npurpose of error correction in audio watermarking.\nHamming codes can detect up to two simultaneous bit\nerrors and correct single bit errors; thus, reliable\ncommunication is possible when the \"hamming distance\"\nbetween the transmitted and received bit patterns is less than or\nequal to one [8]. In contrast, simple parity codes cannot correct\nerrors and can only detect an odd number of errors. In this\napplication, we are using the (15, 11) form of the hamming\ncode. The improvement in the quality of received signal is\nclearly visible from the following waveforms:\n\nThe corresponding results for Audio Watermarking with\nnoise have been tabulated as follows:\nTABLE II.\n\nCALCULATION OF MSE WITH NOISE\nMSE\n\nTypes\n\nWatermarked with noise\n\nWatermark with noise\n\nAudio in Audio\n(Interleaving)\n\n0.010\n\n0.010\n\nAudio in Audio\n(DCT)\n\n0.002\n\n0.008\n\nImage in Audio\n\n0.003\n\n1.92 \uf0b4 103\n\nAudio in Image\n\n323.3\n\n0\n\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nDCT is an effective and robust algorithm for audio\nwatermarking as the audio signal retrieved is clearly audible.\nHamming Codes enable data correction in case of data\ncorruption during transmission and help in recovering the\noriginal audio signal.\nREFERENCES\n[1]\n\n[2]\nFigure 16.
