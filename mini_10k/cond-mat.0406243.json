Ihn).\n\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier Science\n\n1 November 2018\n\n\fregime as realizations of quantum bits (qubits) within quantum information\nprocessing schemes has become a strong motivation for research on these systems. Spin states in dots lend themselves for the realization of spin qubits.\nIt has been demonstrated theoretically [1] that experimental control over a\ntime-dependent spin Hamiltonian of the form\n\u0124 =\n\nX\ni,j(<i)\n\n~i S\n~j +\nJij (t)S\n\nX\n\n~ i (t)S\n~i\n\u03bcB gi (t)B\n\n(1)\n\ni\n\nwould allow the realization of all quantum logic operations required for quantum information processing. In eq. (1), the first term describes the exchange\n~i , S\n~j ) with the exchange coupling constants\ninteraction between pairs of spins (S\n~i in an\nJij (t) and the second term describes the Zeeman splitting of spin states S\n~ i (t) weighted with the Land\u00e9-factor gi (t). Apart from\nexternal magnetic field B\nits importance for qubit applications, the Hamiltonian (1) describes fundamental spin physics present in any quantum dot with negligible spin-orbit interaction. Owing to the fact that the spin states of quantum dots have been experimentally far less investigated than orbital (charge) states, a large number of experiments were reported in recent years [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17].\nAmong them are studies of the Zeeman splitting in a parallel magnetic field\n[2,3,4,5], ground state spins in a perpendicular field [6,7], spin pairing [8,9],\nsinglet\u2013triplet transitions as a function of magnetic field [10,11,12,17] and gate\nvoltages [13], and spin-blockade effects [7,14,15]. Many of these studies focus\non single or coupled few-electron quantum dots [5,16,17], in which the physics\ndescribed by the above Hamiltonian is expected to appear in its simplest form.\nIn this paper, we focus on a Coulomb-blockaded many-electron quantum ring.\nAlthough many-electron systems are typically analyzed with statistical approaches [18], we were able to show previously that the level spectrum of\n2\n\n\fhigh quality many-electron quantum ring structures in the Coulomb blockade\nregime can be understood in great detail [19]. Here we report experiments that\nexhibit the physics of the Hamiltonian (1), namely, the Zeeman effect and exchange interaction effects in this system. Furthermore, we demonstrate how a\nsinglet\u2013triplet transition based on exchange can be induced using appropriate\ngate voltages [13].\nThe ring-shaped quantum dot sample has been fabricated on an AlGaAs-GaAs\nheterostructure containing a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) 34 nm below the surface, with density 5 \u00d7 1015 m\u22122 and mobility 90 m2 /Vs at 4.2\nKelvin. The quantum ring has been defined by room temperature local anodic\noxidation with a scanning force microscope (SFM) which allows to write oxide\nlines on a semiconductor surface that locally deplete the 2DEG underneath\n[20]. Figure 1a shows an SFM image of the quantum ring with average radius\nr0 = 132 nm containing of the order of 100 electrons. The number of electrons\non the ring is tuned by applying voltages Vpg1 and Vpg2 to the plunger gates.\nAdditional in-plane gates and a top gate (not labeled in Fig. 1(a)) control the\ncoupling of the ring to source and drain contacts. Experiments were carried\nout in a dilution refrigerator with a base temperature of 80 mK using dc and\nlow-frequency ac lock-in techniques.\n\n1\n\nZeeman splitting and ground state spins\n\nFor the observation of clear Zeeman splitting in a quantum dot it is crucial\nto eliminate orbital effects of the magnetic field that can be orders of magnitude larger. The magnetic field can be applied normal or parallel to the\nplane of the electron gas. Figure 1b shows the conductance of the ring (gray\n3\n\n\fFig. 1. (a) SFM image of the sample. Dark lines represent the oxide lines. The\nquantum ring is coupled to source and drain via quantum point contacts in the\ntunneling regime. Plunger gates left and right of the ring tune the electron number\nin the Coulomb-blockade regime of the ring one by one. (b) From left to right:\nSpectrum as a function of perpendicular magnetic field and as a function of in-plane\nmagnetic field. The peaks for the in-plane field measurement were all offset by the\nsame small amount in order to match the spectrum before rotation of the sample.\n(c) Peak spacing of neighboring conductance peaks from the parallel field data in\n(b). The three expected slopes labeled a (ascending), f (flat), and d (descending)\nare shown at the top.\n\nscale) as a function of plunger gate voltage Vpg = Vpg1 = Vpg2 (vertical axis)\nand magnetic field (horizontal axis). The latter was applied normal to the\nplane of the electron gas for the left panel and parallel for the right panel. In\nboth cases, conductance peaks are visible as dark stripes, separated by bright\nregions of very small conductance. Conductance peaks are numbered consis4\n\n\ftently throughout this paper. If the magnetic field is oriented normal to the\nplane of the ring, conductance peaks show Aharonov\u2013Bohm-type oscillations\nperiodic with each additional flux quantum h/e penetrating the ring [19,21].\nStates that move up and down in plunger gate as a function of magnetic field\nare extended around the ring, while those with a weak magnetic field dispersion tend to be localized in one ring arm [19,21]. Neighboring peaks oscillating\nexactly in parallel are strong candidates for spin pairs [8,9], i.e. the same orbital state is successively occupied by spin-up and spin-down. An example of\nsuch a pair is peak 10 and 11. Raw data showing this pair together with its\nZeeman splitting was published in Ref. [9].\nWhen the magnetic field is oriented parallel to the plane of the ring (right panel\nin Fig. 1(b)), individual conductance peaks show a weak parabolic diamagnetic shift to higher plunger gate voltages. Considering the different magnetic\nfield scales for the two orientations it is apparent from Fig. 1(b) that the diamagnetic shift of levels in Bk is about an order of magnitude smaller than\nthe level shift in B\u22a5 . In addition it is found here, in agreement with previous investigations [4,22], that the diamagnetic shift of levels is, with sufficient\naccuracy, the same for neighbouring conductance peaks. This property allows\nthe elimination of the diamagnetic shift, if peak spacings are analyzed rather\nthan absolute peak positions. This is necessary because the expected Zeeman\nsplitting in GaAs is tiny compared to the orbital effects discussed so far: an\nestimate using the GaAs bulk g-factor gives g\u03bcB = 25 \u03bceV/T, where \u03bcB is\nBohr's magneton. The peak spacings determined from the parallel field data\nin Fig. 1(b) are shown in Fig. 1(c). These peak spacings can be interpreted\nusing [4]\n(N +1)\ne\u03b1pg \u2206Vpg\n(Bk ) = (sN +1 \u2212 2sN + sN \u22121 )g\u03bcB Bk + const.,\n\n5\n\n\fwhere sN is the spin quantum number of the dot along Bk and \u03b1pg is the\nlever arm of the plunger gate. Differences of successive ground state spins\n\u03b4N = sN \u2212 sN \u22121 take on half-integer values that can be interpreted as the\n'spin of the added electron'. The second difference \u03b6N = sN +1 \u2212 2sN + sN \u22121\ntakes on integer values. The slopes of peak spacings observed in Fig. 1(c) can\nbe classified in the range between 2 and 4 T (shaded region) by the three\ninteger values -1, 0 and 1 as descending, flat and ascending. The results of an\nexperimental evaluation of the slopes g\u03b6N and the \u03b6N values are tabulated in\nTable 1. Some of the slopes, e.g., (11-10) and (6-5), are in excellent agreement\nwith the GaAs bulk g-Factor of -0.44, and most of them fall into the gray\nshaded areas d,f,a indicated at the top of Fig. 1(c). The only exceptions are\n(5-4) and (13-12). The origin of these fluctuations in the slopes that are also\nreported by other authors [3] remain to be investigated. In our case, part of\nthe fluctuations could arise due to small differences in lever arms for different\nstates (< 10%) or due to other states with different spin that are close in\nenergy.\n\nFrom the knowledge of a series of values \u03b6N , series of ground state spins can\nbe generated. Table 1 shows the ground state spins sN and the added electron\nspins \u03b4N for the data shown in Fig. 1(c). It is reassuring to notice that the \u03b4N\nvalues are in agreement with two families of Bk -dispersions in the raw data in\nFig. 1(b). Peaks with \u03b4N = 1/2 tend to curve upwards, while those with \u03b4N =\n\u22121/2 tend to stay flat. This direct analysis is possible, because the diamagnetic\nshift of peaks is small in our sample. The sN -series in Table 1 is not unique.\nOther series can be generated by adding a constant integer or half integer to all\nthe given sN values. Additional information is therefore required to pinpoint\nthe ground state spins uniquely. It is known from numerical calculations of\n6\n\n\fquantum dots in a similar regime [23] that ground state spins with |sN | > 3/2\nare extremely unlikely. It turns out that this restriction reduces the number\nof possible ground state spin series to only four, i.e. the one given in Table 1\nand those where 1/2, 1 or 3/2 is added to all the given sN -values.\n\npeak\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\ng\u03b6N\n\n0.18\n\n-0.44\n\n-0.13\n\n0.5\n\n-0.55\n\n0.01\n\n\u03b6N\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1/2\n\n\u03b4N\nsN\n\n1/2\n\n-1\n\npeak\n\n-1/2\n\n-1/2\n\n10\n\n0\n\n11\n\n-1/2\n-1/2\n\n12\n\n1/2\n\n-1/2\n\n-1\n\n13\n\n-1/2\n14\n\n15\n\ng\u03b6N\n\n0.42\n\n-0.17\n\n-0.26\n\n0.52\n\n-0.12\n\n\u03b6N\n\n1\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n\u03b4N\n\n-1/2\n\nsN\n\n1/2\n-3/2\n\n1/2\n-1\n\n-1/2\n-1/2\n\n1/2\n-1\n\n-1\n\n1/2\n-1/2\n\nTable 1\nGround state spins sN and added electron spins \u03b4N for the data shown in Fig. 1(c).\nThe values g\u03b6N were determined from average slopes of lines in Fig. 1(c) between 2\nand 4 T.\n\n7\n\n\f2\n\nSpin-paired orbital levels\n\nAdditional information about the states in the ring can be obtained by applying a finite voltage difference between the two plunger gates to the left and\nthe right of the ring [13,24]. The level spectrum plotted as a function of this\n'asymmetry' \u03b1 is shown in Fig. 2(a). Two types of states can be recognized:\nstates that are extended around the ring have a weak dependence on \u03b1 (e.g.,\nstates 6,8,10,11) while those localized in one arm of the ring depend strongly\non \u03b1 (e.g., states 4,7,9). This spectrum allows, together with the B\u22a5 -data in\nFig. 1(b), to identify spin pairs. For example, the extended states 10 and 11\nrun exactly in parallel as a function of \u03b1 (Fig. 2(a)) and as a function of B\u22a5\n(Fig. 1(b)) and are therefore identified as a spin pair. The same is true for extended states 6 and 8 which do not lead to neighboring conductance peaks at\nzero asymmetry. It can be verified in the \u03b4N -row of Table 1 that each of these\nspin pairs indeed has one spin-up (1/2) and one spin-down (-1/2) assigned for\nthe tunneling electron. Among the more localized states, 2 and 4 can be called\na spin pair owing to their identical slope in Fig. 2(a) and their B\u22a5 behavior\nin Fig. 1(b). In contrast, states 7 and 9 have different slopes (Fig. 2(a)), the\nsame spin (Table 1) and are therefore not a spin pair. However, 7 pairs up\nwith 12 and probably also 9 with 14. All the spin pairs have the property\nthat \u03b4N = \u22121/2 is occupied before \u03b4N = 1/2, because the former is lower in\nenergy. The only remaining unpaired level in the range of our measurement is\n5. Taking the typical spacing between spin pairs into account and considering\nthat state 5 has \u03b4N = 1/2, we conclude that the missing partner for state 5 is\nlower in energy. It is therefore reasonable to assume that all states below 5 are\npaired and that therefore the ground state spin in valley (6-5) is zero. With\n8\n\n\fFig. 2. (a) Energy levels in the ring as a function of asymmetry. Plotted are the\npositions of conductance peaks with an energy of 270 \u03bceV subtracted between neighboring peaks. (b) Corresponding spin configuration as described in the text.\n\nthis assumption, the ground state spin series given in Table 1 is the one that\nwe favorize among the four possible. Figure 2b shows the resulting ground\nstate spin states for the data in Fig. 2(a).\n\n3\n\nExchange interactions and singlet\u2013triplet transition\n\nIt is interesting to note that the phase diagram in Fig. 2(b) predicts transitions from sN = 0 to sN = 1 at constant electron number, driven by gate\nvoltages. Such singlet\u2013triplet transitions are interesting in view of the Hamiltonian (1) because the triplet state becomes the ground state due to exchange\ninteractions. The quantum ring with its states classified as 'extended' or 'localized' is in certain respects comparable to a double quantum dot system\nwith states, e.g., classified as 'left' or 'right'. It has been shown that the magnitude of exchange matrix elements can be extracted from such experiments\n[10,13]. It turns out, however, that in the data shown above, the exchange energy is smaller than the broadening of energy levels and cannot be observed.\n9\n\n\fFig. 3. (a) Energy levels in the ring as a function of asymmetry. Plotted are the\npositions of conductance peaks with an energy of 270 \u03bceV subtracted between neighboring peaks. Data are adapted from Ref. [13]. (b) Corresponding spin configuration.\n\nHowever, in another cooldown of the same sample, a gate-voltage induced\nsinglet\u2013triplet transition was identified and the exchange energy was extracted\n[13]. Figure 3a shows the measured energy spectrum as a function of plunger\ngate asymmetry \u03b1 with localized states (steep ascending slope) and extended\nstates (weakly ascending slope). The spectrum can be interpreted as the crossing of two spin-paired levels. The corresponding spin filling extracted from a\nsimilar analysis as that discussed above is depicted in Fig. 3(b). Tuning the\nsystem with gate voltages along the line indicated by the dashed arrow leads\nto a singlet\u2013triplet\u2013singlet transition for the uppermost two electrons. The\nextracted exchange energy matrix element of 25 \u03bceV is larger than kT , but\nabout an order of magnitude smaller than the corresponding Hartree energies\nfor extended states (360 \u03bceV), localized states (530 \u03bceV) and the Hartree energy matrix element for a pair of an extended and a localized state (335 \u03bceV)\nthat can be extracted [13]. Singlet\u2013triplet transitions have been observed in\nstrong magnetic fields before [10,11,12].\n10\n\n\fIn conclusion, we have shown how the spin states of a Coulomb blockaded\nmany-electron quantum ring system can be investigated in great detail. Zeeman splitting of energy levels was observed in an in-plane magnetic field and\npossible series of spin ground-states were found. Using the energy shift of orbital states as a function of perpendicular magnetic field and asymmetric gate\nvoltages, pairs of states with identical orbital wave functions but opposite\nspins were identified. Using this knowledge, the number of plausible sequences\nof ground state spins could be reduced to only one. Knowing the spin ground\nstates of the ring as a function of experimental parameters, it was possible\nto identify a gate-voltage induced singlet\u2013triplet transition. The magnitude of\nthe exchange matrix element could be extracted.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] D. Loss, D. P. DiVincenzo, Phys. Rev. A 57, 120 (1998).\n[2] D.S. Duncan, D. Goldhaber-Gordon, R.M.
