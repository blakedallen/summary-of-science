Introduction\nThe observation of very-high energy \u03b3-rays (VHE; E > 100 GeV) from distant\nsources offers the unique possibility to probe the density of the meta-galactic radiation field at ultraviolet (UV) to infrared (IR) wavelengths, which is commonly\nlabeled the extragalactic background light (EBL; typically 0.1-100 \u03bcm). The VHE\n\u03b3-rays interact with the low energy EBL photons via the pair production process\n(\u03b3VHE \u03b3EBL \u2192 e+ e\u2212 ) and the flux is attenuated [1, 2]. This attenuation can leave\ndistinct signatures in the measured VHE spectra. With assumptions about the\nsource physics and the spectrum emitted at the source location (intrinsic spectrum), constraints on the density of the EBL can be derived [e.g. 3, 4].\nThe current generation of VHE instruments (H.E.S.S., MAGIC, VERITAS)\nsignificantly increased the number of known extragalactic VHE sources from 4\nin the year 2003 to more than 25 today. These discoveries, combined with the\nadvanced spectral resolution of these instruments and the wide energy range they\ncover, led to new strong constraints on the EBL density, in particular at optical to\nnear-IR (NIR) wavelengths [5, 6, 7]. Since these limits depend on assumptions\nabout the source physics, the strong constraints also sparked intense discussions\non the validity of the assumptions and possible caveats [e.g. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13].\nThis discussion has not yet converged and there are interesting arguments for both\nsides.\nCurrent generation systems have recently been upgraded (MAGIC-II) or the\nupgrades are under construction (H.E.S.S. II). These upgrades are mainly aimed\nto improve the overall sensitivity by a factor two to three and extend the energy\nrange toward the lower energy regime of 20 to 100 GeV. This will lead to some\nimprovements, but a quantitative difference or a breakthrough compared to the\nperformance of the existing facilities will only be achieved with an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity. The Next Generation Cherenkov Telescope\nSystems (NGCTS) are in the advanced planing phase aiming to achieve this order\nof magnitude improvement: the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA1 ) [14] and the\nAdvanced Gamma-ray Imaging System (AGIS2 ) [15]. Whereas CTA envisions\nto improve the sensitivity over a wide energy range from the few tens of GeV to\nthe multi TeV regime, AGIS mainly concentrates on energies above 100 GeV, an\nextended field of view and an improvement of the angular resolution.\nThe potential of these upcoming experiments to probe the EBL is the topic of\n1\n2\n\nhttp://www.cta-observatory.org/\nhttp://www.agis-observatory.org/\n\n2\n\n\f\u03bd I\u03bd (nW m-2 sr -1)\n\n102\nStecker et al. - fast evolution\nRaue & Mazin - generic\nFranceschini et al.\n\n10\n\n1 -1\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n\u03bb (\u03bcm)\n\nFigure 1: Present day (z = 0) EBL density of the EBL models/shapes utilized in this study (Stecker\net. al: [16]; Raue & Mazin: [17]; Franceschini et al.

While an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity for an astronomical instrument will always lead to new and unexpected results, this article\nwill - as a first step - focus on known results and their extrapolation according\nto the sensitivities of the next generation instruments. Emphasis will be on new\ntechniques enabled by the performance features (extended sensitivity and energy\nrange) of the upcoming instruments.\nFor the calculations in the paper a standard \u039bCDM cosmology with h = \u03a9\u039b =\n0.7 and \u03a9M = 0.3 is adopted.\n2. Basic assumptions and simulation details\nEBL models and attenuation. The precise level of the EBL density is not well\nknown. Solid lower limits from integrated deep galaxies counts at optical and\ninfrared wavelengths do exist [e.g. 19, 20, 21, 22], but direct measurements are\nhampered by dominant foregrounds [23]. Over a large wavelength region in the\ninfrared the best upper limits on the EBL density are derived from VHE observations of distant sources [e.g. 5, 6, 7]. To account for the uncertainty in the EBL\ndensity two different approaches are followed here: (i) To illustrate the effect of\n3\n\n\fAttenuation\n\n1\n\nz = 0.03\n10-1\n\nz = 0.2\n\nSteckerFE\nGen\nFran08\n\n10-2\n10-1\n\n1\n\n10\nEnergy (TeV)\n\nFigure 2: Attenuation for VHE \u03b3-rays for the EBL models utilized in this study for sources at\nredshift z = 0.03 (thin lines) and z = 0.2 (thick lines).\n\nthe different EBL densities two extreme EBL models are used: for the low EBL\ndensity case the model from [18] (Fran08 in the following) is adopted, for the high\nmodel the fast evolution case from [16] (SteckerFE in the following) is used. It\nshould be noted that the later model is already disfavored by several VHE observations. (ii) Detailed studies of the effect of different EBL densities are carried out\nby scaling the EBL density presented in [17] (Gen in the following) and Fran08.\nThe present day EBL densities (z = 0) for the EBL models utilized in this work\nare displayed in Fig. 1\nFig. 2 displays the resulting attenuation for VHE \u03b3-ray sources at 2 different redshifts (z = 0.03 and 0.2) for the models utilized. Several features can be\nidentified:\n\u2022 At low energies (< 80 GeV) the spectrum is practically not attenuated.\nSince this energy range will be sampled by the NGCTSs with high precision, it will be possible to measure the unabsorbed spectrum.\n\u2022 At energies between 80 GeV and 2 TeV the attenuation is increasing due\nto the EBL photons in the optical to near-infrared range peak of the EBL\ndensity.\n4\n\n\f\u2022 At energies between 2 to 10 TeV a flattening of the attenuation is expected,\ndue to the \u223c \u03bb\u22121 behavior of the EBL density in the near to mid-infrared,\nresulting in a constant attenuation. Such a modulation of the EBL attenuation has been considered as a possible key signature for EBL attenuation\n[e.g. 24, 25]. Unfortunately, the intrinsic weakness of the sources combined\nwith the sensitivity of the instruments make it very difficult to probe such\na feature with previous or current generation experiments. For the SteckerFE model the EBL density in this wavelength range is flatter, resulting in\na smoother attenuation from 100 GeV to 10 TeV, suppressing such a feature.\n\u2022 At energies around 10 TeV the turnover in the EBL density towards the farinfrared peak of the EBL results in a strong attenuation, effectively resulting\nin a cut-off in the measured spectra.\nThe strength and the position of these features vary with the distance of the VHE\nsources, the assumed EBL model, and the overall EBL density.\nEBL limits from VHE observations. So far, VHE sources used to derive limits on\nthe EBL density belong to a single source class, active galactic nuclei (AGNs),\nand the majority of them to the Blazar sub-class, which are AGNs with strong jet\nactivity and the jets are closely aligned to the line of sight of the observer. Up\nto now, mainly two different methods - and thereby assumptions about the source\nintrinsic spectrum - have been utilized to derive limits on the EBL density:\n\u2022 Spectral concavity. It is assumed that the overall intrinsic source spectrum\nat high energies will follow a concave shape, or at least will not show an\nexponential rise towards the highest energies. These assumptions are well\nmotivated by the common leptonic modeling of the sources under investigation (blazars), although different (maybe more exotic models) can possibly\nreproduce such a feature [e.g. 8]. Limits on the EBL density are derived by\nexcluding EBL densities that would lead to such features in the observed\nsources. This method naturally probes the EBL at wavelengths from the\nmid to the far-infrared.\n\u2022 Maximum spectral hardness. To probe the EBL in the optical to nearinfrared, it is assumed that the intrinsic source spectrum cannot exceed\na certain absolute hardness. While somewhat similar in spirit to the first\nmethod the underlying assumptions are stronger, since in the energy range\nof interest (100 GeV to several TeV) the spectral shape of the intrinsic spectrum is more uncertain. While most of the basic models used to describe the\n5\n\n\fIntegral flux limit ( s-1 cm-2 )\n\nNGCTS\nHESS I\nMAGIC I\nMAGIC II\nCTA (Bernloehr '08)\nFermi/LAT 1/10 yrs\n\n10-10\n10-11\n10-12\n\n10\n\n%\n\n-13\n\n1%\n\nCr\n\nab\n\n10-14\n\n0.1\n\n%\n\n-15\n\nCr\n\nab\n\n10\n\n10-16 -2\n10\n\nCr\n\nab\n\n10\n\n10-1\n\n1\n\n102\n10\nEnergy (TeV)\n\nFigure 3: Integral flux sensitivity (5\u03c3 in 50 h) of the NGCTS used in this study in comparison to the sensitivity of existing observatories (H.E.S.S.: [26]; MAGIC: [27]; Fermi:\nhttp://www-glast.slac.stanford.edu/software/IS/glast lat Performance.htm).\n\nsource spectra indeed imply that the VHE spectrum does not exceed a certain hardness, the absolute value is less certain3 and possible source intrinsic\neffect (e.g. internal absorption [11]) could complicated the situation.\nIn this paper two different methods to derive limits on the EBL density will be\nexplored: (i) utilizing the unabsorbed part of the VHE spectrum and (ii) searching\nfor attenuation modulation signatures. While not completely new, it will be shown\nthat with the NGCTS's extended energy range paired with its vastly improved\nsensitivity it will be possible to utilize these methods effectively for the first time.\nMethod (i) holds the potential to derive limits on the EBL density with a minimal\nset of assumptions, while method (ii) enables to not only derive upper limits on\nthe EBL density but to probe the absolute level.\nEffective area, background rate and sensitivity. To simulate the spectra, which\nwill be detected by the NGCTS, assumptions about the sensitivity of the instru3\n\ne.g. \u0393 = 1.5 \u2212 0.6 for dN/dE \u223c E \u2212\u0393 and simple leptonic models.\n\n6\n\n\fment have to be made. As baseline sensitivity, the sensitivity of the \"4 large +\n85\" CTA array presented in [26] is taken and the sensitivity is derived assuming\nan effective detector area (effective area) and a background rate. For the effective\narea the post cut MAGIC effective area at 20 deg zenith angle ([28]) scaled up\nby a factor 20 is adopted to reach an effective area exceeding 106 m2 at energies\nabove a few hundred GeV. In addition, the MAGIC effective area is shifted by a\nfactor of 2 to lower energies to reflect the improved sensitivity at low energies. 4\nThe resulting effective area ANGCT S versus energy E in the energy range 20 GeV\nto 20 TeV is well described by the function\nANGCT S = 2.5 * 1016 m2 (E/1 TeV)6 (1 + (E/(1 TeV * 0.02))0.9 )\u22126/0.9\n\n(1)\n\nThe differential background rate after event selection cuts is approximated by a\nbroken power law function with photon index 3.6 below and 2.7 above the break\nenergy of 300 GeV, similar to what is seen in current generation instruments. The\nabsolute level of the background flux rate is chosen so that the resulting sensitivity\nmatches the sensitivity of the CTA \"4 large + 85\" array from [26]. The integral\nsensitivity adopted in this study for the NGCTS in comparison to current generation and future HE/VHE instruments is displayed in Fig. 3. In the overlap region\nit follows very well the CTA sensitivity for the \"4 large + 85\" array from [26]\nup to 10 TeV. Compared to current instruments (H.E.S.S., MAGIC, VERITAS)\nthe sensitivity in the core energy range between 100 GeV and 10 TeV is improved\nby about one order of magnitude. In addition, the energy range is extended toward lower and higher energies. With the chosen parameters for the effective area\nand the background rate at low energies significant sensitivity is reached down\nto energies below 20 GeV, which enables a large overlap region in energy with\nthe Large Area Telescope (LAT) onboard Fermi satellite. For this energy region,\nwhere there is no overlap with the published CTA sensitivity (<40 GeV), there is\nof course a certain degree of freedom in the choice of parameters and therefore\nthe sensitivity is not very well constrained. In this study only energies between\n40 GeV and 10 TeV will be used.\nSpectrum simulation method. To calculate the simulated spectrum the number of\n\u03b3-photon events NS (signal) and background events NBG per energy bin need to be\n4\n\nThe energy threshold approximately scales linearly with 1/Area of the mirror area of the single\ntelescope. For a CTA type NGCTS instruments the largest telescopes are expected to have mirror\ndiameter in the order of 24 m which gives a factor two larger area compared to 17m for the MAGIC\nmirror.\n\n7\n\n\fdetermined: the NGCTS effective area folded with the assumed intrinsic source\nflux is integrated over the energy bin; the same is done for the background events\nintegrating over the background rate in the bin. Both numbers are multiplied\nwith the effective observation time. Different functions are utilized to describe\nthe intrinsic flux and they will be discussed further in the section where they first\nappear. The attenuation of the source flux due to the EBL is calculated following\nthe recipe given in [6, 13]: the attenuation is directly folded into the intrinsic\nspectrum and then the attenuated intrinsic flux function folded with the effective\narea is integrated over the energy bin. The number of signal events is randomly\nvaried assuming a Poisson distribution. It is assumed that the background is well\ndetermined (e.g. via background measurements in a large sky area compared to\nthe signal region). The error on the number of photons N\u03c3 in a bin is derived\nutilizing equation 17 from [29] assuming 5 background regions (i.e. an alpha\nfactor of 0.2). The signal in an energy bin is considered significant when all\nof the following criteria are met: (1) the signal significance exceeds 3 standard\ndeviations, (2) there are at least 10 excess events in the bin, (3) the number of\nexcess events in the bin exceeds 3% of the number of background events. This last\ncondition takes into account a systematic error in the determination of the number\nof background events. These are rather conservative assumptions, since e.g. in\ncurrent publications on VHE \u03b3-astronomy often energy bins with significances\ndown to 1.5 \u03c3 or less are included in the analysis.\nIACT experiments have a limited energy resolution which, for current generation instruments, is in the order of <15% for energies above 100 GeV [e.g. 30]\nand <40% down to 70 GeV [28]. For MAGIC-II an energy resolution of <25%\nfor energies down to \u223c 50 GeV is achievable [see Fig. 3 of 31]. Due to the, on\naverage, higher number of telescopes participating in each event and the increased\nmirror size of the large telescopes the energy resolution for an NGCTS is expected\nto improve further. Such an energy resolution paired with an energy spectrum unfolding method [e.g. 32] will enable to robustly reconstruct smooth spectral shapes\n(e.g. power law or log parabola) even down to low energies. The reconstruction\nof an EBL attenuation structure at mid-energies is possibly more affected by the\nlimited energy resolution and this will be further discussed at the end of Sect. 4.\nSimulation example. Fig. 4 displays simulated spectra for two sources and two\nassumed EBL densities for an observation time of 20 h. The intrinsic spectrum\nis assumed to follow a simple power law (\u03a6(E) = \u03a60 \u00d7 (E/1 TeV)\u2212\u0393 ), with the\nparameters adopted so that the EBL attenuated simulated spectrum matches the\nmeasured one.

In the case of 1ES 1101-232 the hard measured spectrum in combination\nwith the larger distance leads to a very hard intrinsic spectrum (i.e. harder than\nanticipated by simple leptonic and hadronic models), even for the low EBL model.\nSuch a hard intrinsic spectrum coupled with the relative weakness of the source\n(\u223c2% Crab) leads to a simulated spectrum which does not largely increase the\nenergy range covered compared to the H.E.S.S. measurement of 1ES 1101-232:\nneither at low energies (due to the hard spectrum) nor at high energies (the strong\nEBL attenuation suppresses the signal below the NGCTS sensitivity). Even for\nthe case of the two very different assumed EBL models, no strong difference in\nthe simulated spectra is apparent, which could be used to differentiate between\nthe models. This is different in the case of PKS 2155-304, where, for the different\nEBL models, very different spectra are expected to be measured at lower energies.\nThe behavior at low energies will be discussed further in the next section.\n3. Utilizing the unabsorbed part of the spectrum\nOne of the main features of a NGCTS will be a high sensitivity in the energy\nrange between 20 and 100 GeV, an energy range which holds the possibility to\ndirectly sample parts of the energy spectrum of a source, which are not affected\nby the EBL attenuation. In this section it will be explored how this energy range\ncan be utilized to derive limits on the EBL density, and what are possible problems\nand caveats.\nSimulation & analysis chain. The following simulation and analysis chain is utilized:\n1. Calculate EBL attenuation for a specific EBL density and source distance.\n2. De-attenuate a measured spectrum and fit with power law (dN/dE = \u03a60 *\nE \u2212\u0393 ). The fit results serve as input flux function for the simulated spectrum.\n3. Simulate spectrum as measured by an NGCTS with calculated input flux\nfunction.\n4. Fit simulated spectrum in a low energy regime (intrinsic spectrum) and high\nenergy regime (absorbed spectrum). Again, a simple power law function is\nused in each energy regime.\n10\n\n\f\u03bd F\u03bd ( erg cm-2 s-1 )\n\n10-10\n\n10-11\n\n10-12\n\n10-13 -4\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n10-2\n\n10-1\n\n1\n10\nEnergy (TeV)\n\nFigure 5: Example of simulated spectra for different EBL densities.

An observation time of 20 h has been assumed, which\ncould easily be extended given that this is a steady flux state. As EBL model the\nFran08 model is used, scaled in steps of 0.1 from 0.7 to 1.7 (Fig. 6).\nFit-range & source intrinsic break. The resulting EBL attenuations for the scaled\nmodels are shown in Fig. 7 upper left panel. The energy ranges used to fit the\npower laws are marked by colored boxes. In the high energy range the attenuation follows approximately a power law and since the input spectrum is also a\npower law, the resulting attenuated spectrum will follow a power law as well. In\nthe low energy range no significant absorption is present. As recent Fermi/LAT\nobservations show, a spectral break is observed between the GeV and the TeV\nenergy range [34]. For many sources this break can be attributed to a break expected from EBL attenuation. For these sources an NGCTS would be able to\nsample the intrinsic spectrum down to very low energies. In other cases, e.g.\nPKS 2155-304, the break between GeV and TeV range is stronger than expected\nfrom EBL attenuation, therefore an additional, source intrinsic break is expected\nsomewhere between the two energy bands. Currently, the statistics for this energy\nrange for the sources considered here is not yet sufficient to correctly model the\nbreak.

Fig. 7 upper middle panel shows the spectral\nindex resulting from the power law fit for the two energy bands for the different\nscalings of the EBL model. The markers show the mean spectral index of the fits,\nwith the error given as the RMS of the mean spectral index distribution (shaded\nbands). As alternative error definition the mean error on the spectral index from\nthe fit could be used which gives similar results. The black crosses mark the\nspectral index utilized for the input source spectrum. It can be seen that the fit in\nthe low energy band reproduces very well the assumed intrinsic spectral indices.5\nFor the highest scaled EBL densities the effect of attenuation becomes relevant\nin the low energy band and the spectral index from the fit is steeper (larger) than\nthe one from the input spectrum. This effect will be discussed in more detail\nbelow. The right panel of the figures displays the strength of the spectral break\nbetween the two power laws \u0393LOW \u2212 \u0393HIGH , with the error bands calculated via\nerror propagation. An EBL density scale factor of 0.1 corresponds to one to two\nstandard deviations difference in the strength of the break. 6 Note that a scaling\nof 0.1 corresponds to an EBL density of \u223c1 nW m\u22122 sr\u22121 at 2 \u03bcm which is of the\nsame order as the error on the lower limits from integrated source counts at this\nwavelength. The detection of a break with certain strength can be converted into\nan upper limit of the EBL density (thick dashed line). In principal, a single well\nmeasured spectrum is sufficient to derive such limits. Since EBL attenuation is a\nglobal, redshift dependent phenomenon, in general, a combined fit to all available\nVHE data should be used to derive limits on the EBL density [see e.g. 6]. This is\ndiscussed in more details in Sect. 5.\nEBL attenuation at low energies. The same analysis has been performed utilizing the Gen EBL model and the results are displayed in Fig. 7 lower row. The\nGen EBL density in the ultraviolet to optical is higher than in the Fran08 model\n(Fig. 1), therefore resulting in a non negligible attenuation in the low energy band\n5\n\nThe correlation between the EBL density and the spectral index in the low energy band is a\nresult of the methodology i.e. for each EBL density a corresponding intrinsic spectrum is constructed.\n6\nI.e. if the Fran08 EBL model is correct and the intrinsic spectrum follows a power law in the\nenergy range considered a 1.3 scaling of the model could be excluded with 3 standard deviations.\n\n14\n\n\fAttenuation\n\nAttenuation\n\n1\n\n10-1\n\n1\n\n10-1\n\n10-1\n\n1\n\n10-1\n\n10\nEnergy (TeV)\n\n1\n\n10\nEnergy (TeV)\n\nFigure 8: Energy dependent upper limits on the attenuation for the Fran08 (left) and the Gen (right)\nEBL models derived utilizing the PKS 2155-304 quiescence spectrum. Shown are the limits taking\ninto account the 1\u03c3 error on the flux points (orange filled squares), with the addition of the 1\u03c3 error\non the spectral index of the low energy power law (red filled triangles), and no errors (purple filled\ncircles). The black line shows the attenuation for the EBL model utilized, grey lines show the\nattenuation for the EBL model scaled in steps of 0.1.\n\n(Fig. 7 lower left panel). Consequently, the power law fit in the low energy band\nresults in a too soft spectrum compared to the input source spectrum (Fig. 7 lower\nmiddle panel). This mis-reconstruction, if taken at face value, would lead to an\noverestimated upper limit on the EBL density (Fig. 7 lower right panel). To be\nable to utilize the low energy part of the spectrum as proxy for the intrinsic spectrum it is therefore crucial to carefully examine the spectral shape in the energy\nrange for signs of curvature. A conservative approach would be to correct the flux\npoints in the fit energy range for the attenuation from a maximum EBL before\nperforming the fit. On the other hand, if a high statistic VHE spectrum from a\ndistant source does not show any indication of curvature in this energy regime,\ntight limits on the EBL density in the ultraviolet to optical EBL can be derived.\nEnergy dependent attenuation limits. The power law fit to the low energy region,\nif taken as proxy for the intrinsic spectrum, can also be used to derive energy\ndependent upper limits on the attenuation. Such limits can be extremely useful:\nthe EBL attenuation is an energy dependent process, where certain wavelength\nregions of the EBL spectrum are connected to certain VHE energy ranges. Features in the EBL density, as e.g. expected from the first stars [see e.g. 35], could\n15\n\n\ftherefore also produce features in the attenuation. The resulting energy dependent\nEBL attenuation limits from such an analysis for the Fran08 and the Gen EBL\nmodel utilizing the PKS 2155-304 quiesent spectrum are shown in Fig. 87 . As can\nbe seen from the figure, the dominant source of errors in such an analysis are the\nuncertainties on the spectral index from the power law fit in the low energy range,\nsince the statistical errors on individual flux points are comparably small. Again,\nthe rejection power is in the order of 1-2 \u03c3 per 0.1 scaling of the EBL density at\nenergies > 1 TeV, when utilizing a simple and ad-hoc error definition. In the case\nof the Gen EBL model again the effect of the attenuation \"spill over\" in the low\nenergy fitting band is visible: due to the EBL attenuation the power law fit is too\nsoft, resulting in an underestimated EBL attenuation and too strong limits.\nFlaring states. Up to here only the quiescent flux state of sources has been considered, since its observation is guaranteed. AGNs do also show extreme flaring\nbehavior with high fluxes, unfortunately usually only for short periods of time.\nHere, the VHE spectrum recorded during the extreme flux outburst of PKS 2155304 in 2006 [36] is investigated. The spectrum is an averaged spectrum of 1.5 h\nof observations, in which the source showed several strong flares with time-scales\ndown to a few minutes. While no strong spectral variations in the VHE spectrum\nhave been observed during this flare, for the analysis only short observations of\n6 min length have been considered, demonstrating the power of the NGCTS to\nderive high quality spectra even on such short time-scales. In addition, the EBL\nattenuation is a \"stationary\" effect in the spectrum, therefore a temporally fine\nresolved flaring state might enable to distinguish between intrinsic and EBL effects. The resolution of the EBL density achieved for such a 6 min observation\nof the source in a flaring state is comparable with the one achieved for 20 h of\nquiescence observations (Fig. 9 top row).\nNearby sources. Strong flux outbursts in the VHE regime have also been observed\nin the two nearby sources Mkn 421 and Mkn 501. While the smaller distances\nresult in less EBL attenuation and therefore a weaker signature, the overall higher\nflux levels of these two sources enable to derive spectra with high event statistics.\nHere, the time-averaged VHE spectrum of Mkn 501 during the 1997 high state is\ninvestigated, assuming an observation time of 20 h. As can be seen from Fig. 9\nbottom row, while the overall strength of the break between the two power laws is\n7\n\nFor this investigation only a single simulated spectrum without applying the statistical dicing\nof the event numbers is used.\n\n16\n\n\fAttenuation\n\n\u0393 FIT\n\n3.4\n3.2\n\n1\n\n3\n2.8\n2.6\n2.4\n\n10-1\n\n2.2\n2\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n1.4\n1.6\n1.8\nEBL density scale factor\n\n10-1\n\nAttenuation\n\n\u0393 FIT\n\n1.8\n0.6\n\n2.3\n\n1\n\n10\nEnergy (TeV)\n\n1\n\n2.2\n\n2.1\n\n2\n\n1.9\n0.2\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n1.4\n1.6\n1.8\nEBL density scale factor\n\n10-1\n\n1\n\n10\nEnergy (TeV)\n\nFigure 9: EBL limit results from power law fits to low and high energy bands of the VHE spectrum\nusing scaled version of the Fran08 EBL model (see Fig. 7 and 8 for detailed description).

In addition, the problem of\nattenuation in the low energy band is less severe. One caveat - at least for the case\nof Mkn 421 - is the fact that there are strong indications for an intrinsic (not EBL\nrelated) break between the GeV and TeV range at relatively high energies (around\n100 GeV) [34], which would make it difficult to define a proper low energy region\nvoid of any curvature. A different method, discussing the possibilities of how such\nhigh quality spectra with a wide energy range produced by a nearby source can be\nused to test the EBL density, is discussed in the next section.\n4. Attenuation modulation at mid-energies\nThe NGCTS will achieve an unprecedented sensitivity in the intermediate energy range, i.e., between 100 GeV and few TeV. For nearby sources, this energy\nrange is most sensitive for the EBL density in the optical to infrared regime (\u223c115 \u03bcm), which can, thus, be probed very efficiently with an NGCTS measurement\nof an AGN energy spectrum.\nSmoothness of AGN spectra. The measured energy spectra of AGNs in the energy\nrange between 100 GeV and few TeV follow usually a smooth shape. For most\nof the measured sources, a simple power law fit is sufficient to describe the available data well, whereas for sources in a flare state (like the flare of PKS 2155-304\nin 2006) or with a generally high emission state (like Mkn 421), either a curved\npower law or a power law with a cut-off are successfully used. The curved power\nlaw (also known in the literature as the double-log parabola) is expected to describe the spectra well at energies close to the position of the Inverse-Compton\npeak. The power law with a cut-off instead is the expected behavior of a source\nwhich does not provide necessary conditions for acceleration of charged particles to sufficiently high energies. All scenarios do have one common feature: the\nmeasured spectra can be described by smooth functions,i.e., no features, wiggles\nor pile-ups are expected, especially after de-convolving the spectra for the effect\nof the EBL absorption. This property can, therefore, be used to distinguish between different overall EBL levels in the optical to infrared regime: whereas the\n\"correct\" EBL model and level will produce a smooth intrinsic AGN spectrum, an\n\"incorrect\" EBL level would result in a signature (in form of well defined wiggles)\nin the reconstructed intrinsic spectrum.\nThe strength of the method is that the EBL signatures in the reconstructed\nAGN spectra will not only be visible (measurable) in the case where the assumed\n18\n\n\fEBL level is higher than the real one, but also in case the assumed EBL level is\nlower than the real one. It is, therefore, the first indirect method to really measure\nthe EBL density at z=0.\nSimulation & analysis chain. The utilized methodology is sketched below:\n1. Assume an intrinsic spectral shape and the flux level of a known strong\nextragalactic gamma-ray source.\n2. Simulate NGCTS spectrum assuming the absorption due to the standard\nEBL, i.e., with the scaling factor of 1.\n3. Reconstruct intrinsic spectrum of the source assuming a scaled EBL level.\nFor a scaling, which is different enough from the standard EBL, the reconstructed AGN spectrum will show distinct wiggles.\n4. To characterize the presence of the wiggles, a fit by a smooth source function (spectral shape) \u0010is performed. \u0011The chosen fit shape is the curved power\nlaw: dN/dE = N0 \u00d7 E \u2212\u03b1+\u03b2 log(E/E0 )\n5. The resulting \u03c72 of the fit is then used to judge if the change in the EBL\nlevel results in an improbable reconstructed intrinsic spectrum.\n6. Repeat the simulation 1000 times for the given EBL scaling and compute\nthe mean and the RMS of \u03c72 values from the fits to the reconstructed intrinsic spectrum.\nSimulation example. The steps 1\u20134 of the method are illustrated in Fig. 10 for the\nVHE spectrum of Mkn 501. The assumed spectral shape and the flux level of the\nintrinsic spectrum are adapted to the flux measured by HEGRA [37] during the\noutburst of the source in 1997: the original data are shown by grey open squares\nin the upper panel of the figure. The simulated NGCTS spectrum calculated using\nthe 'correct EBL' (Gen EBL model; scale factor 1) is shown in red, whereas the\nassumed intrinsic spectrum of Mkn 501 is shown by the solid grey line and the reconstructed intrinsic spectrum is shown by the blue filled circles. The effect of the\nmis-reconstruction of the intrinsic spectrum is shown for the example of an EBL\nscaled by a factor of 1.3: the reconstructed intrinsic spectrum (green filled triangles) clearly shows wiggles in the fit range. The effect of the wiggles is more visible in the lower panel of the figure where the residuals to the best fit function are\nshown. The wiggles are quantified by a fit in the energy range between 100 GeV\nand 7 TeV, well before a possible pile-up in the spectrum arises. The choice of\nthe fit range is made in order not to bias the result by the level of the EBL above\n\n19\n\n\fEnergy density (ergs cm-2 s-1)\n\nMkn 501, HEGRA, measured\nExpected spectrum to be observed\nReconstruced intrinsic spectrum with 'correct EBL'\nReconstruced intrinsic spectrum with EBL\u00d71.3\nCrab (MAGIC)\n\n-9\n\n10\n\n-10\n\n10\n\n10-11\n\nObservation time: 50.0 hours\n- \u03b1 + \u03b2 log (E/E )\n\nResiduals (\u2206 F/F)\n\nResiduals (\u2206 F/F) Residuals (\u2206 F/F)\n\nAGN spectral form: dN/dE = N0 \u00d7 (E\n\n10\n\n0\n\n)\n\n0.1\n0\n-0.1\n-0.2\n\nUsing correct EBL and HEGRA data, \u03c72/NDF = 13.6/8, fit probab: 9.4e-02\n2\nUsing EBL \u00d7 1.3 and HEGRA data, \u03c7 /NDF = 14.0/8, fit probab: 8.1e-02\n\n0.02\n0\n-0.02\n\nUsing correct EBL and NGCTS data, \u03c72 /NDF = 13.4/12, fit probab: 3.4e-01\n\n0.02\n0\n-0.02\n0.01\n\nUsing EBL \u00d7 1.3 and NGCTS data, \u03c7 /NDF = 51.4/12, fit probab: 7.9e-07\n2\n\n0.02\n\n0.1\n\n0.2 0.3\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3 4 567\n\n10\n\n20 30 40\n\n100\n\nEnergy (TeV)\n\nFigure 10: Search for signatures at mid-VHE in the Mkn 501 spectrum.

The black\nhorizontal lines correspond to fit probabilities as labeled.\n\n10 \u03bcm, to which the VHE spectra are very sensitive due to a super exponential dependency of the attenuation with the wavelength in that range. Using the correct\nEBL level to reconstruct the intrinsic spectrum, the intrinsic spectrum is well described by a smooth function (Fig. 10, middle lower panel). Instead, when using\na \"wrong\" scaled EBL density characteristic deviations (wiggles) from a smooth\nfunction are visible (Fig. 10, lower panel). The wiggles are quantified by a reduced\n\u03c72 value of 51.4/12, corresponding to a fit probability of 7.9 * 10\u22127 . The small fit\nprobability for the assumed scaled EBL level implies (under used assumptions)\nsignificant presence of the unphysical wiggles and, therefore, an exclusion of that\nparticular EBL realization. For comparison, HEGRA measured spectrum is also\nde-absorbed using the same two EBL models and the results are shown by grey\nfilled and open circles in the upper panel. The residuals to the best fits are shown\nin the middle upper panel. The difference between the two curves (represented by\ngrey filled and open circles) is not significant and is difficult to see. The similar\nreduced \u03c72 values of 13.6/8 and 14.0/8 underline that the HEGRA measurement\nwas not sensitive to the method.\nResults of the analysis. This procedure is repeated 1000 times for every scaled\nEBL density in order to achieve a solid statistical mean and a 1 \u03c3 (68%) coverage of the reduced \u03c72 values. The results are shown in Fig. 11 for two different\nNGCTS exposures (20 and 50 hours) plotting the mean reduced \u03c72 values in21\n\n\fcluding 68% error bars versus the EBL scaling factor. As a result one can see a\nparabola-like curve with the minimum at EBL scaling factor of 1.0, which is via\nconstruction the correct EBL model. The expected mean reduced \u03c72 values are\nshown by the blue filled squares and the green filled circles for the exposures of\n20 hr and 50 hr, respectively. The corresponding fit probabilities of P=50%, 1%\nand 0.01% are shown by the dotted, short-dashed and long-dashed lines, respectively. An EBL scaling is considered to be excluded when the mean reduced \u03c72\nvalue including its 68% error exceeds the \u03c72 value for P=0.01%. For the case\nconstructed here this means that in case of 50 hours observation, the EBL scalings\nbelow 0.65 and above 1.35 are excluded. In the case of 20 hours observation, the\nEBL scalings above 1.50 are excluded.\nCaveats of the method. The method presented above is not only sensitive in constraining the EBL density but it is also a first attempt to resolve the actual EBL\nlevel. Still, the method has several caveats: (i) There is a possibility that the intrinsic VHE spectrum is not smooth for some AGNs. For example, several emission regions or several generations of charged emitting particles (e.g., electrons)\nmay produce spectral features which would mimic the signature from a wrong\nEBL model. Though neither the AGNs observed at low energies with Fermi/LAT,\nnor the extragalactic VHE \u03b3-ray sources observed so far with IACTs have shown\nstructured spectra, such wiggles can be interpreted as the result of a wrong EBL\nmodel only if found to exist in several spectra of different sources consistently.\n(ii) The spectral signature shown in Fig. 10 can only be recognized well after a\nlong exposure of a source being in a flare state. The data of the Mkn 501 flare\nfrom 1997 used for the study remains unique so far. This means that it cannot\nbe expected that a study with such precision can be done on many sources with\nfuture NGCTS. Still, the indirect EBL measurement based on few strong flares\nwill be of high importance. (iii) The limited energy resolution of IACTs (\u223c10%)\ncould affect the possibility of detecting such a signature. The overall shape of\nthe attenuation effect is broad enough in energy to not strongly be affected by the\nsmoothing of an energy resolution of < 10%. For nearby sources, however, the\nwiggle structure produced by the wrongly assumed EBL model is only of order of\na few per cent of the total flux level. An additional spread introduced by the spillover effects due to events with mis-reconstructed energy may enhance or alter the\nwiggles. Therefore, an efficient and precise spectral unfolding technique will be\nkey to overcome these problems for nearby sources. For more distant sources the\nattenuation signatures get quickly stronger. It will be, therefore, highly interesting\nto study a strong flaring state from a source at redshift & 0.1 with the NGCTS.\n22\n\n\f5. Summary & Conclusions\nIn this paper the potential of a Next Generation Cherenkov Telescope System (NGCTS) to study the EBL through observations of VHE spectra from distant sources is explored. In the focus of the study lies the energy range between 40 GeV and 10 TeV, where a factor 10 improvement in sensitivity over\ncurrent generation experiments is expected. Two different methods are investigated: (i) utilizing the unabsorbed part of the VHE spectrum in the energy range\n40-100 GeV and (ii) searching for attenuation modulation signatures at energies\nbetween 100 GeV to 7 TeV. While some caveats, like e.g. the exact shape of the\nintrinsic spectra, do exist, overall the two methods show promising results, clearly\ngo beyond what is possible with current generation instruments.\nEBL attenuation is a global phenomenon that affects the spectra of all sources\nin the same way. It is therefore quite natural to expand the studies on the EBL by\ncombining the results from different methods, sources or source flux states. This\ncan e.g. be done by utilizing log-likelihood methods to combine the constraints\nfrom different sources and methods. In addition only the low and mid-VHEs have\nbeen investigated. At energies > 10 TeV further signatures from EBL attenuation\n(\"cut-off\") are expected, which have been used extensively in the past to derive\nlimits on the EBL density in the FIR.\nIn this paper only data from a single instrument - a NGCTS - and minimal\nassumptions about intrinsic spectrum have been used to derive constraints on the\nEBL density. AGNs are observed all across the electromagnetic spectrum and\nthe theory predicts connections between the observations at different energies. A\nwealth of multi-wavelength information is therefore accessible, which - in combination with a theoretical model - can be used to constrain the spectrum at VHE.\nA first model-dependent approach to determine the EBL level using a consistent\nSED modeling of detected blazars was discussed recently by [38]. While a detailed discussion of this topic is beyond the scope of this paper, as an example it\nshould only be mentioned the power of combining the Fermi observations at MeV\nto GeV energies with observations from an NGCTS: such observations will cover\nover 9 decades (!) in energy with high precision.\nThe sources under study show strong flux variability in the VHE band. The\nhigh sensitivity of a NGCTS will enable to study the energy spectrum on very\nshort time-scales in great detail. The time resolution will enable stronger constraints on the theoretical modeling of the source spectra since the experimental\ndata will be available on shorter scales than the relevant changes in the emission\nregions. This will further help to disentangle source intrinsic effects and EBL\n23\n\n\fattenuation.\nIn this study only the VHE spectra of a few selected known sources have been\ninvestigated. The NGCTS will bring new discoveries. With the high sensitivity in\nthe 20 to 100 GeV range it will be possible to detect fainter sources and sources\nat higher redshift. A (sufficiently) large sample of sources will serve a two-fold\npurpose: (1) help to improve the understanding of the intrinsic source physics and\n(2) enable statistical studies of the EBL effects, e.g. by investigating the EBL\nattenuation features versus redshift. This will also enable to not only probe the\npresent day EBL but to study its evolution with redshift. How such a study can be\nperformed with the help of an NGCTS will be the topic of a second paper.\nAcknowledgments\nMR and DM would like to thank M. Persic and M.
