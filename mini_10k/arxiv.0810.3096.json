The fourmomentum squared transferred at the proton vertex, t, provides a relevant scale to investigate\nthe application of perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD) for |t| \u226b \u039b2QCD [1]. In\nthis Letter, the first measurement at large t (|t| > 4 GeV2 ) of diffractive photon-proton scattering, \u03b3p \u2192 \u03b3Y , where Y is the proton dissociative system, is presented. The measurement\nis performed at HERA by studying the reaction e+ p \u2192 e+ \u03b3Y in the photoproduction regime\nwith a large rapidity gap between the final state photon and the proton dissociative system Y\n(as illustrated in figure 1a). The centre of mass energy of the system formed by the exchanged\nphoton and proton is in the range 175 < W < 247 GeV. This process constitutes an extension\nof Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering [2] into the large |t| and small Q2 regime.\nDiffractive photon scattering can be modelled in the proton rest frame by the fluctuation of\nthe incoming photon into a q q\u0304 pair at a long distance from the proton target. The q q\u0304 pair is then\ninvolved in a hard interaction with the proton via the exchange of a colour singlet state. In the\nleading logarithmic approximation (LLA), the colour singlet exchange is modelled by the effective exchange of a gluon ladder (figure 1b). For sufficiently low values of Bjorken x (i.e. large\nvalues of W ), the BFKL [3] approach is expected to be appropriate for describing the gluon\nladder. In the LLA BFKL model the gluon ladder couples to a single parton (predominantly a\ngluon) within the proton. The cross section depends therefore linearly on the parton distribution in the proton. Due to the quasi-real nature of the incoming photon (Q2 < 0.01 GeV2 ), the\ntransverse momentum of the final state photon, PT\u03b3 , is entirely transferred by the gluon ladder\nto the parton in the proton. The separation in rapidity between the parton scattered by the gluon\nladder and the final state photon is given by \u2206\u03b7 \u2243 log(\u015d/(PT\u03b3 )2 ), where \u015d is the invariant mass\nof the system formed by the incoming photon and the struck parton. The proton remnant and\nthe struck parton hadronise through fragmentation processes to form the hadronic system Y .\nAssuming parton-hadron duality, hadrons originating from the struck parton correspond to the\nparticles with the largest transverse momenta and hence are the closest in rapidity to the scattered photon.\nThe present analysis complements the measurements of exclusive production of \u03c1, \u03c6 and\nJ/\u03c8 mesons at large |t| [4\u20137]. The measured W and t dependences of their cross sections were\nfound to be in agreement with LLA BFKL based calculations [8\u201312]. For the process studied\nhere, theoretical calculations are simplified by the absence of a vector meson wave function: the\nonly non-perturbative part of the calculation is the parton distribution functions of the proton.\nHowever, the cross section is suppressed relative to that of vector meson production by the\nelectromagnetic coupling of the q q\u0304 pair to the final state photon, making the measurement more\nchallenging.\nIn the following, measurements of the photon-proton cross sections are presented as a function of W and differentially in |t| and are compared to predictions based on LLA BFKL calculations [12].\n\n4\n\n\fe (k \u2032 )\n\ne (k)\n\n\u03b3\n\n\u03b3 (p\u03b3 )\n\n\u03b3\n\n(*)\n\n\u03b3(*)(q)\n\u2206\u03b7\nxIP , t\n\np (p)\n\np\n\n}\n\n}\n\nY(pY )\n\na)\n\nY\n\nb)\n\nFigure 1: a) Schematic illustration of the ep \u2192 e\u03b3Y process. b) Illustration of the \u03b3 (\u2217) p \u2192 \u03b3Y\nprocess in a LLA BFKL approach.\n\n2 The H1 Detector\nA detailed description of the H1 detector can be found elsewhere [13]. The following briefly\ndescribes the detector components relevant to this analysis. A right handed coordinate system\nis defined with the origin at the nominal ep interaction vertex, such that the positive z axis\n(forward direction) corresponds to the direction of the outgoing proton beam. The polar angle\n\u03b8 and transverse momentum PT are defined with respect to the z axis. The pseudorapidity is\ndefined as \u03b7 = \u2212 ln tan(\u03b8/2).\nA liquid argon (LAr) calorimeter covers the polar angle range 4\u25e6 < \u03b8 < 154\u25e6 with full\nazimuthal coverage. The LAr calorimeter consists of both an electromagnetic section and a\nhadronic\nmeasured in a test beam is \u03c3E /E =\np section. The energy resolution for single particles p\n12%/ E/GeV \u2295 1% for electrons and \u03c3E /E = 50%/ E/GeV \u2295 2% for hadrons [14].\nThe polar angle region 153\u25e6 < \u03b8 < 177\u25e6 is covered by a lead-scintillating fibre calorimeter,\nthe SpaCal [15], with both electromagnetic and hadronic\npsections. The SpaCal has an energy\nresolution for electromagnetic showers of \u03c3E /E = 7%/ E/GeV \u2295 1%.\nCharged particles are detected in the polar angle ranges 15\u25e6 < \u03b8 < 165\u25e6 by the Central Track\nDetector (CTD) and 5\u25e6 < \u03b8 < 25\u25e6 by the Forward Track Detector (FTD). The CTD comprises\ntwo large cylindrical jet drift chambers, providing precise track measurements in the r \u2212 \u03c6\nplane, supplemented by two z-chambers and two multi-wire proportional chambers arranged\nconcentrically around the beam-line. The CTD is complemented by a silicon vertex detector\n[16] covering the range 30\u25e6 < \u03b8 < 150\u25e6 . The FTD consists of layers of planar and radial drift\nchambers to provide measurement of the \u03b8 and \u03c6 angles of forward tracks, respectively. The\ntrackers and the calorimeters are operated within a solenoidal magnetic field of 1.16 T.\nThe luminosity is determined from the rate of Bethe-Heitler events, ep \u2192 ep\u03b3, measured\nusing a \u010cerenkov crystal calorimeter, the Photon Detector (PD), situated near the HERA beam\npipes at z = \u2212103 m. A second \u010cerenkov\np crystal calorimeter, the Electron Tagger (ET), with\nan energy resolution of \u03c3E /E = 17%/ E/GeV \u2295 1%, is located at z = \u221233 m. The ET\nmeasures the energy of the positron when scattered through an angle of less than 5 mrad in the\nenergy range 8 < E < 20 GeV. The detection of the scattered positron in the ET ensures that\nthe exchanged photon is quasi-real with Q2 < 0.01 GeV2 .\n5\n\n\f3 Event Kinematics and Selection\nFollowing the notation introduced in figure 1a, the scattering process, e+ p \u2192 e+ \u03b3Y , is described by the usual Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) kinematic variables:\nQ2 = \u2212q 2 = \u2212(k \u2032 \u2212 k)2 ,\n\ny=\n\np*q\n,\np*k\n\nwhere k, p, k \u2032 and q are the four-momentum of the incoming positron, the incoming proton,\nthe scattered positron and the exchanged photon, respectively. The variable Q2 is the virtuality\nof the exchanged photon and y is the inelasticity of the ep interaction, corresponding to the\nrelative energy loss of the scattered positron in the proton rest frame. The ep centre of mass\nenergy squared is given by s = (k + p)2 and the \u03b3p centre of mass energy squared is W 2 =\n(q + p)2 \u2243 ys. In addition, the longitudinal momentum fraction of the diffractive exchange\n(called the Pomeron in the Regge model [17]) with respect to the proton is defined as:\nxIP =\n\nq * (p \u2212 pY )\n,\nq*p\n\nwhere pY is the four-momentum of the Y system. The elasticity of the \u03b3p interaction, which can\nbe seen as the fractional energy of the exchanged photon transferred to the final state photon, is\ngiven by 1 \u2212 yIP , where:\np * (q \u2212 p\u03b3 )\n,\nyIP =\np*q\np\u03b3 being the four-momentum of the final state photon. Finally the square of the four-momentum\ntransfer across the diffractive exchange is given by:\nt = (q \u2212 p\u03b3 )2 = (p \u2212 pY )2 .\nThe data used in this analysis were collected with the H1 detector during the 1999 \u2212 2000\nrunning period, when positrons of energy Ee = 27.6 GeV collided with protons of energy Ep =\n920 GeV in the HERA accelerator. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of\n46.2 pb\u22121 . More details on the present analysis can be found in [18].\nThe data were recorded using a combination of two triggers. Both triggers select an electromagnetically interacting particle in the SpaCal which corresponds to the scattered photon\ncandidate. One of the triggers requires in addition an energy deposit in the ET, corresponding\nto the scattered positron. The effective trigger efficiency, including time dependent downscale\nfactors, amounts to approximately 50%.\nThe reconstruction of the kinematic quantities used in the following are approximations\nvalid in the limit of small scattering angles of the positron and small transverse momentum\nof the Y system compared to its longitudinal momentum. The quantity y, and hence W , is\ncalculated from the scattered positron energy, Ee\u2032 , measured in the ET using the relation y =\n1 \u2212 Ee\u2032 /Ee . The relative resolution of W is 4%. To avoid regions of low ET acceptance, the\nenergy of the scattered positron is limited to 11 < Ee\u2032 < 19 GeV, corresponding to 175 <\nW < 247 GeV. In addition, to suppress backgrounds from processes occurring in coincidence\n6\n\n\fwith Bethe-Heitler events, it is required that no energy deposits above the noise threshold are\nmeasured in the PD.\nPhoton candidates are selected from energy clusters with small radii detected in the electromagnetic section of the SpaCal. If significant energy is measured behind the cluster in the\nhadronic section of the SpaCal, the event is rejected. Events with more than one cluster above\nthe noise level in the SpaCal are also rejected. To reduce the background from charged particles, the cluster of the photon candidate must have no associated track in the CTD. The photon\ncandidates are furthermore required to have an energy E\u03b3 > 8 GeV and a transverse momentum\nPT\u03b3 > 2 GeV.\nThe hadronic final state Y is reconstructed using a combination of tracking and calorimetric information. The difference between the total energy E and the longitudinal component of\nthe total momentum Pz , as calculated from the scattered positron, the final state photon and\nthe hadronic system Y , is restricted to 49 < \u03a3(E \u2212 Pz ) < 61 GeV. This requirement suppresses non-ep induced background and background due to the overlap during the same bunch\ncrossing of a Bethe-Heitler event with a DIS event. For a fully contained ep event the relation\n\u03a3(E \u2212 Pz ) = 2Ee = 55 GeV holds.\nIn the case that charged particles from the final state are detected by the tracking detector,\nallowing the primary vertex to be reconstructed, the z coordinate of the vertex has to satisfy\n|z| < 35 cm. For 25% of the selected events, all charged particles of the final state lie outside\nthe detector acceptance and no event vertex is reconstructed. In this case, the time averaged\nvertex position is used for the kinematic reconstruction.\nThe kinematic variable |t| is reconstructed as:\n|t| = (PT\u03b3 )2 ,\nwith a relative resolution of 11%. The longitudinal momentum fraction of the diffractive exchange with respect to the proton is reconstructed using the formula:\nxIP \u2243\n\n(E + Pz )\u03b3\n,\n2Ep\n\nwhere (E + Pz )\u03b3 is the sum of the energy and longitudinal momentum of the final state photon.\nThe event inelasticity of the \u03b3p interaction is reconstructed as:\nP\n(E \u2212 Pz )\n,\nyIP \u2243 Y\n2(Ee \u2212 Ee\u2032 )\nwhere the summation is performed on all detected hadronic final state particles in the event, i.e.\nall measured particles except the scattered positron and the final state photon. This reconstruction method has the advantage that the loss of particles along the forward beam pipe only has\na marginal effect on the reconstruction of yIP . Diffractive events are selected by requiring that\nyIP < 0.05. The cut value ensures a large pseudorapidity gap, \u2206\u03b7, between the photon and the\nproton dissociative system Y , since yIP \u2243 e\u2212\u2206\u03b7 .\nFinally, to reduce contamination of the signal by non-diffractive background, it is required\nthat the difference in pseudorapidity between the photon and the closest final state hadron satisfies \u2206\u03b7 > 2. This rapidity gap is inferred from the absence of activity in the relevant detector\n7\n\n\fparts, i.e. absence of any track or a cluster of energy deposits above the noise threshold of 400\nMeV in the LAr calorimeter. 1\nAfter applying all selection criteria, 240 events remain in the data sample.\n\n4 Monte Carlo Simulations and Comparison to Data\nMonte Carlo (MC) simulations are used to correct the data for effects of detector acceptance\nand efficiency, to estimate the background and to compare model predictions to the data. All\ngenerated MC events are passed through the full GEANT [19] based simulation of the H1\ndetector and are reconstructed using the same analysis chain as is used for the data.\nThe HERWIG 6.4 [20] MC event generator is used to simulate the diffractive high |t| photon scattering using the LLA BFKL model [10\u201312]. At leading logarithmic accuracy there are\ntwo independent free parameters in the BFKL calculation: the value of the strong coupling \u03b1s\nand the scale, c, which defines the leading logarithms in the expansion of the BFKL amplitude,\nln(W 2 /(c |t|)). In exclusive production of vector mesons, the scale parameter c is related to the\nvector meson mass. In the case of diffractive photon scattering, the unknown scale results in\nthe absence of a prediction for the normalisation of the cross section [21]. In the calculations\nconsidered here [12], the running of \u03b1s as a function of the scale is ignored. In order to distinguish the \u03b1s parameter of the LLA BFKL model from the usual strong coupling constant this\nparameter will henceforth be referred to as \u03b1sBF KL . The choice of \u03b1sBF KL = 0.17 is used for\nthe simulation in this Letter.\nIn the asymptotic approximation of the calculations [12], the W distribution follows a\npower-law:\n\u03c3(W ) \u223c W 4\u03c90 ,\nwhere the exponent, also called the Pomeron intercept, is given directly by the choice of \u03b1sBF KL\nwith \u03c90 = (3\u03b1sBF KL /\u03c0) 4 ln 2. Using the HERWIG simulation this approximation is found\nto be justified given the current experimental statistical precision. The LLA BFKL model predicts an approximate power-law behaviour for the t dependence of the cross section of the form\nd\u03c3/d|t| \u223c |t|\u2212n , where n, also predicted by the model, depends only on the parton density functions (PDFs) of the proton and the value of \u03b1sBF KL . Running coupling effects, not considered\nhere, would in principle allow n to depend on t.\nThe GRV94 PDFs [22] are used for the proton PDFs in the HERWIG prediction. A comparison with the CTEQ5 [23] and MRST PDFs [24] shows little dependence of the HERWIG\nprediction on the input proton PDFs.\nIn order to describe the data, the t dependence of the diffractive photon scattering simulated\nusing HERWIG (predicting a value of n = 3.31 for \u03b1sBF KL = 0.17) was weighted by a factor\n|t|0.73 , i.e. the |t| power is modified from \u22123.31 to \u22122.58. This weighted HERWIG prediction\nis used to correct the data for resolution and acceptance effects.\n1\nThe noise level of the LAr calorimeter is about 10 MeV per cell and the average number of cells per cluster\nis typically 60.\n\n8\n\n\fPossible sources of background are estimated using MC simulations. The background from\ninclusive diffractive photoproduction events (ep \u2192 eXY , where the two hadronic final states\nare separated by a rapidity gap) is simulated using the PHOJET MC event generator [25]. This\nbackground contributes when a single electromagnetic particle fakes the photon candidate in the\nSpaCal. It is estimated to amount to 3% of the measured cross section. The background from\nelectron pair production (ep \u2192 ee+ e\u2212 X) is modelled using the GRAPE event generator [26].\nThis process contributes to the selection if one lepton is detected in the ET, a second lepton fakes\nthe photon within the SpaCal and the remaining lepton escapes detection. This background\ncontributes 4% of the measured cross section.\nIn order to investigate the background from high |t| diffractive exclusive \u03c9 production,\nwhere the \u03c9 decays through the \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 or \u03c0 0 \u03b3 channel, a sample was generated using the\nDIFFVM Monte Carlo generator [27]. The contribution from this background process is found\nto be negligible. The background from DIS events, in which the scattered positron fakes the\nphoton candidate and an overlapping photoproduction or Bethe-Heitler event gives a positron\ndetected in the ET, has been studied and was also found to be negligible.\nIn figure 2 the data, corrected for trigger efficiency, are compared to the Monte Carlo simulations. The background predictions from GRAPE and PHOJET are normalised to the integrated\nluminosity of the data sample. The weighted HERWIG prediction is normalised to the number\nof events obtained after the subtraction of the predicted background from the data. A good\ndescription of the data by the combined Monte Carlo simulations is observed.\n\n5 Cross Section Measurement\nThe ep \u2192 e\u03b3Y differential cross sections are defined using the formula:\nd2 \u03c3ep\u2192e\u03b3Y\nNdata \u2212 Nbgr\n=\n,\ndW dt\nLA \u2206W \u2206t\nwhere Ndata is the number of observed events corrected for trigger efficiency, Nbgr the expected\ncontribution from background events as estimated using the PHOJET and GRAPE Monte\nCarlos simulations, L the integrated luminosity, A the signal acceptance and \u2206W and \u2206t the\nbin widths in W and t, respectively. The acceptance, estimated using the weighted HERWIG\nsimulation, is the ratio of the number of events accepted after reconstruction to the number of\nevents generated in the defined phase space on hadron level. It accounts for all detector effects,\nincluding bin-to-bin migrations, as well as geometrical acceptance and detector efficiencies.\nQED radiative correction effects are estimated to be less than 1% [28] and are neglected.\nThe \u03b3p \u2192 \u03b3Y differential cross section is then extracted from the ep cross section using:\nd\u03c3\u03b3p\u2192\u03b3Y\nd2 \u03c3ep\u2192e\u03b3Y\n= \u0393(W )\n(W ),\ndW dt\ndt\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the photon flux, \u0393(W ), is integrated over the range Q2 < 0.01 GeV2 according to the\nmodified Weizs\u00e4cker-Williams approximation [29]. The \u03b3p cross section is obtained by modelling \u03c3\u03b3p\u2192\u03b3Y as a power-law in W , whose parameters are iteratively adjusted to reproduce the\n9\n\n\fmeasured W dependence of the ep cross section. The differential \u03b3p cross section in |t| is then\nextracted from the ep cross section by correcting for the effect of the photon flux over the visible\nW range (175 < W < 247 GeV). The \u03b3p cross section as a function of W is obtained by first\nintegrating equation (1) over the |t| range, and then correcting for the effect of the photon flux\nin each bin in W . More details on the extraction procedure of the \u03b3p cross section can be found\nin [18].\nThe systematic error on the measurement stems from experimental uncertainties and from\nmodel dependences. They are calculated using the weighted HERWIG simulation of the signal\nprocess. The sources of systematic error are listed below. For each of them the typical effect on\nthe cross section measurement is indicated.\nThe experimental systematic errors are:\n\u2022 The energy scale uncertainty of \u00b11% for an electromagnetic cluster measured by the\nSpaCal gives errors in the range of 2% to 4%.\n\u2022 The uncertainty of \u00b12.5 mrad for the measurement of the photon candidate polar angle\nresults in an error of up to 3%.\n\u2022 The hadronic final state energy scale uncertainty of \u00b14% leads to an error of less than\n1.5%.\n\u2022 The energy scale uncertainty of \u00b11.5% of the ET produces an error ranging from 1% in\nthe highest |t| bin to 10% in the lowest W bin.\n\u2022 The uncertainty of \u00b125% on the noise threshold from the calorimeters gives an error\nvarying from 5% at low |t| to 11% at the highest |t| value.\n\u2022 The luminosity is measured with an accuracy of \u00b11.5% which enters as an overall normalisation uncertainty.\nThe systematic errors due to uncertainty of model parameters are:\n\u2022 The uncertainty due to the xIP dependence, estimated by weighting the xIP distribution\nby the form (1/xIP )\u00b10.4 , yields an error varying from 3% in the central |t| bin up to 9% in\nthe lowest W bin. This weight would correspond to changing \u03b1sBF KL to the values 0.02\nand 0.31.\n\u2022 The uncertainty due to the |t| dependence, estimated by weighting the |t| distribution by\nthe form (1/|t|)\u00b10.2, leads to an error ranging from 1.5% to 4%.\n\u2022 The uncertainty in the modelling of the proton remnant system Y , estimated by weighting\nthe MY distribution by the form (1/MY2 )\u00b10.3 , results in a typical error of 1% to 4%.\n\u2022 The uncertainty of 100% assumed on the normalisation of the subtracted inclusive diffractive background (from the PHOJET Monte Carlo simulation) leads to an error of approximately 3% in the highest W bins decreasing to 1% in the highest |t| bin.\n10\n\n\f\u2022 The propagation of the uncertainty on the power-law parameter \u03b4 in the \u03b3p cross section\nextraction procedure leads to an error of 4% on d\u03c3\u03b3p\u2192\u03b3Y /d|t|, independent of |t|, and is\nbelow 1% on \u03c3\u03b3p\u2192\u03b3Y .\nThe uncertainty on the PHOJET MC normalisation and the model uncertainties from the\nunknown xIP , |t| and MY dependences are estimated from data comparisons and defined by\nthe range where the model describes the data. Each source of systematic error is varied in the\nweighted HERWIG Monte Carlo within its uncertainty. In each measurement bin, the corresponding deviation of the normalised cross section from the central value is taken as systematic\nerror. The total systematic error is obtained by adding the individual contributions in quadrature, on a bin-by-bin basis. The largest systematic error on the cross sections comes from the\nuncertainty on the xIP and MY dependences in the MC simulation. The total systematic error\non the W dependence of the cross section varies from 10% in the central bins to 17% in the\nlowest bin. The systematic error on the |t| dependence of the cross section varies from 8% in\nthe lowest bin to 14% in the highest bin. An additional global uncertainty of 4% arises from the\n\u03b3p cross section extraction procedure. The total systematic errors are comparable to or smaller\nthan the statistical errors.\n\n6 Results\nThe cross sections measured for the domain 175 < W < 247 GeV, 4 < |t| < 36 GeV2 ,\nyIP < 0.05 and Q2 < 0.01 GeV2 are presented in table 1.\nThe \u03b3p \u2192 \u03b3Y cross section as a function of W is shown in figure 3. A power-law dependence of the form \u03c3 \u223c W \u03b4 is fitted to the measured cross section. The fit yields \u03b4 =\n2\n2.73 \u00b1 1.02 (stat.)+0.56\n\u22120.78 (syst.) with \u03c7 /n.d.f. = 2.7/2. The contributions from the systematic\nerrors are calculated by shifting the data points according to each source of uncertainty, taking\ncorrelations into account, and repeating the fit. The errors are then added in quadrature to obtain\nthe total systematic error.\nThe steep rise of the cross section with W is usually interpreted as an indication of the presence of a hard sub-process in the diffractive interaction and of the applicability of perturbative\nQCD. The present \u03b4 value, measured at an average |t| value of 6.1 GeV2 , is compatible with that\nmeasured by H1 in diffractive J/\u03c8 photoproduction of \u03b4 = 1.29 \u00b1 0.23(stat.) \u00b1 0.16(syst.) [6]\nat an average |t| of 6.9 GeV2 . The Pomeron intercepts associated with these \u03b4 values correspond\nto the strongest energy dependences measured in diffractive processes.\nThe \u03b3p cross section differential in |t|, at W = 219 GeV, is shown in figure 4. Figure 4\nalso shows the comparison of the cross section to a fit of the form d\u03c3/dt \u223c |t|\u2212n . The fit result\n2\nis n = 2.60 \u00b1 0.19 (stat.)+0.03\n\u22120.08 (syst.) with \u03c7 /n.d.f. = 1.6/1. The |t| dependence is harder\nthan that measured by H1 in the diffractive photoproduction of J/\u03c8 mesons at large |t| [6]\ncorresponding to n = 3.78 \u00b1 0.17(stat.) \u00b1 0.06(syst.).\nIn figures 3 and 4 the measured cross sections are compared to predictions of the LLA BFKL\nmodel, using the HERWIG Monte Carlo, as described in section 4, with no |t| weighting.

The lower table presents\nthe measured cross sections differential in |t| at W = 219 GeV. The first errors are statistical,\nthe second systematic. The photon flux \u0393 and corresponding ranges in W and |t| used for the\nmeasurements are also given.\n\nnot predicted by the LLA BFKL calculation [21]. The W dependence of the cross section\nis well described by the LLA BFKL prediction, as shown in figure 3. The sensitivity of the\nmeasurement to the free parameter \u03b1sBF KL in the theoretical prediction is illustrated in figures 3\nand 4. Using \u03b4 = 4 \u03c90 = 4 (3\u03b1SF it /\u03c0) 4 ln 2, the measured W dependence leads to \u03b1SF it =\nBF KL\n= 0.14\n0.26 \u00b1 0.10 (stat.)+0.05\n\u22120.07 (syst.). Predictions are shown in figure 3 for the values \u03b1s\nBF KL\nand 0.37. The LLA BFKL curve corresponding to \u03b1s\n= 0.26 coincides with the solid fit\nline.\nPrevious measurements of diffractive scattering at HERA are well described by BFKL\npredictions with \u03b1sBF KL values similar to the value measured in this Letter. ZEUS measurements of exclusive \u03c1, \u03c6 and J/\u03c8 production at large |t| are best described with the value of\n\u03b1sBF KL = 0.20 [4]. The H1 measurement of high |t| \u03c1 production [5] is compatible with\n\u03b1sBF KL = 0.20 and the H1 measurement of high |t| J/\u03c8 production [6] is described using\n\u03b1sBF KL = 0.18. The LLA BFKL prediction with \u03b1sBF KL = 0.17 gives a good description of the\ndouble dissociation process with a rapidity gap between jets measured by H1 [30]. Events with\nrapidity gaps between jets were also measured by ZEUS [31] and are found to be compatible\nwith a model which uses \u03b1sBF KL = 0.11. Note, however, that for these measurements the hard\nscale, corresponding to the jet transverse momentum squared, is of the order of or larger than\n20 GeV2 .\nAs shown in figure 4, the LLA BFKL calculation for \u03b1sBF KL = 0.14, 0.26 and 0.37, all of\nwhich give a reasonable description of the W dependence, predict steeper |t| distributions than\nis measured in the data. The same effect cannot be established for the exclusive \u03c1 measurement\n[5], where the measured t range is limited to |t| < 8 GeV2 , although an underestimate of the\ncross section was observed at the largest values of |t|. The present situation is in contrast with\nthe analysis of J/\u03c8 production [4, 6], where the |t| dependence was found to be well described\n12\n\n\fby the LLA BFKL prediction over a similar range in t.\n\n7 Conclusions\nUsing the H1 detector, diffractive photon scattering, \u03b3p \u2192 \u03b3Y , where the final state photon\ncarries a large transverse momentum and is well separated from the proton dissociative system Y , is measured for the first time at HERA. The measurement provides a unique test of the\nunderlying QCD dynamics of the diffractive exchange.\nCross sections are presented as a function of W and differentially in |t|. A fit of the form W \u03b4\nperformed on the cross section gives \u03b4 = 2.73 \u00b1 1.02 (stat.)+0.56\n\u22120.78 (syst.). This strong energy\ndependence is compatible with that measured for the exclusive diffractive J/\u03c8 production at\nhigh |t|. A fit of the form |t|\u2212n yields n = 2.60 \u00b1 0.19 (stat.)+0.03\n\u22120.08 (syst.), corresponding to a\nharder |t| dependence of the cross section than measured for high |t| diffractive J/\u03c8 production.\nThe measured cross sections are compared to the predictions of an LLA BFKL model. A\ngood description of the W dependence of the cross section is found, whereas the LLA BFKL\nmodel predicts a |t| dependence that is too soft and hence unable to describe the data.\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe are grateful to the HERA machine group whose outstanding efforts have made this experiment possible.
