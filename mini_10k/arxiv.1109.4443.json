Introduction\nRecent neutrino oscillation experiments have driven quite a few nuclear theorists to study\nneutrino-nucleus interaction. Theoretical study of coherent pion productions (coh\u03c0) has been\nalso on the trend. The charged-current (CC) coh\u03c0 + is \u03bdl + Ag.s. \u2192 l\u2212 + Ag.s. + \u03c0 + , while the\nneutral-current (NC) coh\u03c0 0 is \u03bdl + Ag.s. \u2192 \u03bdl + Ag.s. + \u03c0 0 , where \u03bdl is the neutrino of l = e, \u03bc, \u03c4 ,\nand Ag.s. is a nucleus in its ground state. The process takes place under small momentum\ntransfer from the lepton. The NC coh\u03c0 0 needs to be understood for the \u03bde appearance event,\nbecause when one of two photons from \u03c0 0 \u2192 2\u03b3 is not detected, the NC coh\u03c0 0 can fake the \u03bde\nappearance event. Theoretically, there are two main approaches to coh\u03c0. One of them is based\non the partially conserved axial current (PCAC) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], and the other is based on a\nmicroscopic dynamical model [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. In the following, I discuss both of the\napproaches, and then comparison among them and with recent experimental data.\n2. PCAC-based models\nThe prominent PCAC-based model was proposed by Rein and Sehgal [1] (RS model). The\nmodel is based on the fact that a coh\u03c0 amplitude is proportional to the divergence of the axialcurrent in the limit of q 2 \u2192 0 where q is the momentum transfer from the lepton. The PCAC\ndictates that the divergence of the axial-current is proportional to the pion field. Thus, the coh\u03c0\namplitude and the elastic \u03c0-nucleus scattering amplitude is related. Continuation of the cross\nsection to q 2 6= 0 is parametrized solely by a dipole-type function. The elastic pion-nucleus cross\nsection is simply given by the product of the pion-nucleon elastic cross section, the square of the\nnuclear form factor, and the pion absorption factor. The RS model works well for high energy\nneutrino (E\u03bd >\n\u223c 2 GeV), from medium to heavy nuclei [15]. The RS model has been used in\nmany analyses of neutrino experiments because of its success and simplicity.\nHowever, recent neutrino experiments use neutrino beam of E\u03bd <\n\u223c 2 GeV and relatively light\n12\nnuclei (e.g., C) as a target, for which the validity of the RS model is questionable. Indeed,\nrecent experiments [16, 17] found that CC coh\u03c0 + cross section of the RS model is significantly\nlarger than their data. Rein and Sehgal corrected the RS model by taking account of the finite\nmuon mass whose effect can be significant for low E\u03bd [2]. They found 25% reduction of the CC\ncoh\u03c0 + cross sections for E\u03bd = 1.3 GeV. Further improvements were attempted by Hern\u00e1ndez et\n\n\fal. [3] They pointed out that the elastic pion-nucleus scattering model in the RS model is rather\noff data. They improved the model by considering previously ignored t-dependence of the pionnucleon cross sections, and by using a more realistic pion absorption factor. It was found that,\nalthough the pion-nucleus elastic scattering is significantly improved, the coh\u03c0 cross sections\nfrom the improved RS model are still rather different from those of microscopic calculations.\nMeanwhile, another avenue for the PCAC-based model was explored [4, 5, 6]. There, the\nPCAC relation was used to relate the axial current-nucleus interaction to the pion-nucleus\ninteraction (nuclear PCAC), rather than the axial current-nucleon interaction to the pionnucleon interaction (nucleon PCAC); the latter was employed in the RS model. Thus, they\ncan use the pion-nucleus cross section data directly to calculate the coh\u03c0 cross sections. They\nfound that this change yields a drastic reduction (\u223c 1/2) of the coh\u03c0 cross sections, now the size\nis comparable to those of the microscopic calculations. Strictly speaking, however, the nuclear\nPCAC relates a coh\u03c0 amplitude to the half off-shell pion-nucleus scattering amplitude [18].\nTherefore, the use of pion-nucleus cross section may call for some justification.\n3. Dynamical microscopic models\nA description of coh\u03c0 with a dynamical microscopic model consists of three basic ingredients:\nelementary amplitudes (neutrino-induced pion production off a single nucleon); nuclear medium\neffect on the \u2206-propagation; pion-nucleus final state interaction. In the following, I will discuss\neach of them used in the previous works.\nElementary amplitude : The most important mechanism for the pion production is the \u2206excitation. Thus Refs. [7, 8, 9] used only the s-channel \u2206 diagram for the elementary amplitude.\nAmong the AN \u2206 (A:axial-current; N :nucleon) form factors, the so-called C5A (q 2 ) gives a\nRefs. [7, 8, 9],\ndominant contribution so that the coh\u03c0 cross section is roughly \u03c3coh\u03c0 \u221d |C5A |2 . In\u221a\nthe Goldberger-Treiman (GT) value for C5A (0) was taken: C5A (0) = g\u03c0N \u2206 f\u03c0 / 6mN = 1.2.\nMartini et al. [12] used s- and u-channel nucleon and \u2206 mechanisms as the elementary\namplitudes; the value of C5A (0) is the GT value. Meanwhile, elementary amplitudes used in\nRefs. [10, 11, 14] consists of s- and u-channel nucleon and \u2206 mechanisms, t-channel \u03c0-exchange\nmechanism, a contact and a pion pole terms [19]. Because of the background terms, the value\nof C5A (0) has to be smaller than the GT value by 20% in order to fit neutrino data. So far,\nall elementary amplitudes are based on tree-level calculations. On the other hand, Sato et al.\nproposed a model (SL model [20]) in which tree-level weak pion production mechanisms, which\nare similar to those of Ref. [19], are dressed by multiple \u03c0N rescattering to yield a unitary\nelementary amplitude. The SL amplitude contains significant pion cloud effect, which is unique\nin this model. Bare AN \u2206 couplings were fixed using the constituent quark model. Our group\nused the elementary amplitudes from the SL model [13]. All elementary amplitudes used in\nvarious groups fairly reproduce available data. Unfortunately, available data are rather limited,\nand not enough to test each elementary amplitude model. More good quality data would help.\nMedium effect on \u2206 : In the vacuum, the \u2206 propagates by repeating the decay into \u03c0N state\nand formation of \u2206 (self energy). In a nuclear medium, this process becomes more complicated.\nSome \u03c0N states are forbidden by the Pauli blocking so that the \u2206 decay is suppressed. A\npion emitted from the \u2206 can be absorbed by another nucleon, forming multiparticle-multihole\nconfigurations or RPA(random phase approximation)-type processes. The \u2206 mass and width\ncan shift due to these medium effects. Oset et al. calculated the medium effects on the \u2206\npropagation using a many-body approach [21], and parametrized the shift of the \u2206 mass and\nwidth as a function of the density. Their result has been employed by many people for calculating\nthe coh\u03c0 cross sections [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14]. However, non-locality due to the recoil of the \u2206\nwas not explicitly taken into account in these calculations of coh\u03c0. Leitner et al. [22] pointed\nout this, and showed that the non-local effect can reduce the total coh\u03c0 cross sections by half.\n\n\f0.8\n\n0.8\n\ncm /GeV)\n\n1\n\n2\n\n2\n\ncm /GeV)\n\n1\n\n0.6\n\n-38\n\nd\u03c3/d\u03b7 (10\n\nd\u03c3/dp\u03c0 (10\n\n-38\n\n0.6\n\nconvoluted\nMiniBooNE\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\np\u03c0 (GeV)\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\nFigure 1.

Our group [13] considered\nthe non-locality of the \u2206-propagation as well as several medium effects explicitly. Multiparticlemultihole effects are simulated by a phenomenological spreading potential, parameters of which\nwere fitted to pion-nucleus elastic and total (elastic+inelastic) cross sections. It is important to\nfit the total cross sections because the spreading potential describes pion absorptions.\nFinal state interaction (FSI) : In Refs. [7, 9, 10, 11, 14], pion-nucleus FSI is considered in\ndistorted pion wave function obtained by solving the Klein-Gordon equation with an optical\npotential. The optical potential is based on the \u2206-hole model and the Lorentz-Lorentz correction,\nand reproduces spectra of pionic atoms and low-energy pion-nucleus elastic cross sections [23].\nIn Martini et al.'s approach [12], the elastic pion-nucleus cross section is obtained by solving a\nRPA equation with a bare polarization propagator as the driving term. The bare polarization\npropagator contains various nuclear excitation such as multiparticle-multihole configurations.\nThe model well describes the elastic total cross sections in the \u2206 region. Our group constructed a\npion-nucleus optical potential from \u03c0N amplitudes of the SL model, combined with the medium\neffects on the \u2206. A pion-nucleus scattering amplitude is obtained by solving the LippmannSchwinger equation with the optical potential. The model well describes the elastic differential\ncross sections and the total cross sections in the \u2206 region.\nCoherent pion production : Combining the above-discussed three ingredients, one can calculate\ncoh\u03c0 cross sections. First let us discuss a photo-coh\u03c0 0 . This is a great testing ground for\nmicroscopic models of coh\u03c0 because data of good quality are available. Also, some dynamical\nmodels like ours [13] can predict coh\u03c0 cross sections without any adjustable parameters; all\nparameters have been fitted to pion-nucleus scattering data. Thus we have tested our prediction\nfor photo-coh\u03c0 with data, and found a good agreement [13]. It is noteworthy that the medium\neffects on \u2206 and FSI reduce the cross sections by about half to reach the good agreement. This\nsuccess serves as a good basis to apply our model to the neutrino-coh\u03c0. The pion momentum\ndistribution in CC coh\u03c0 + at E\u03bd = 1 GeV is shown in Fig. 1. Significant medium effects are\nobserved here. The dashed curve contain neither the \u2206 spreading potential nor the FSI. Including\nthese nuclear effects lowers the dashed curve into the solid curve. The dash-dotted curve contains\nonly resonant amplitude, showing significant contribution from non-resonant unitary amplitude.\nThis is in contrast with calculations with tree-level elementary amplitude [19], because the\nnon-resonant amplitude hardly contributes.\n\n\f4. Comparison among models and data\nAt NUINT09, CC and NC coh\u03c0 cross sections from many theoretical models and Monte\nCarlo (MC) codes were compared [24]. Although details are different, recent theoretical\nmodels [4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14] give fairly similar CC and NC coh\u03c0 cross sections. However,\nthe MC code outputs, which are based on the RS model with different modifications, are very\ndifferent from those of the recent theoretical models.\nThere have been large discrepancies between experimental data and theoretical calculations\non the coh\u03c0 cross sections. The latest data from SciBooNE [25] gave the ratio between CC coh\u03c0 +\nand NC coh\u03c0 0 : \u03c3CC /\u03c3N C = 0.14+0.30\n\u22120.28 . On the other hand, all recent theoretical calculations\ngave \u03c3CC /\u03c3N C = 1.5 \u223c 2, which is expected from the isospin factor.\nOne may suspect that this unsatisfactory situation is due to using the RS model in the\nanalyses of the NC data. In fact, several authors [11, 13, 14] have shown that \u03b7-distribution\n(\u03b7 \u2261 E\u03c0 (1 \u2212 cos \u03b8\u03c0 )) of the RS model rather deviates from those of their microscopic models\n(Fig. 2). The \u03b7-distribution has been used in the analyses of the NC data in order to decompose\n\u03c0 0 events into each production mechanism. The use of the RS model in the analyses could have\noverestimated the NC coh\u03c0 0 cross sections. It is very interesting to re-analyze the data with a\nmore realistic coh\u03c0 model.\nAcknowledgments\nI thank the NUFACT11 organizers for the invitation and the financial support for my\nparticipation in the workshop.
