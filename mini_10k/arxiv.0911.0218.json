This curvature is positive, for a sphere, zero for a torus\nand negative for any surface of genus (handles numbers) g \u2265 2. Arnold and Khesin [2]\nshowed that geodesic flows on every Riemann surface whose curvature is negative, and\nconstant provides us with an example of a fast kinematic dynamo [2] with dissipation\nwhere the magnetic field differential closed (dB=0) 2-form B = dA, where A = Ai dxi\n(i,j=1,2,3), does not depend on velocity. This non-geodesic flow defines a dynamical\nsystem in R3 endowed with exponential stretching of particles. In this paper it is shown\nthat non-geodesic magnetic flows embedded in a special type of Riemannian manifold of\nconstant negative curvature 2D manifold called Lobachevsky plane, provides an example\nof a slow dynamo, where dynamo action cannot be supported in the absence of diffusion.\nThe self-induction magnetic flow is solved, in the background of this hyperbolic space.\nIn this case it is shown that the magnetic vector potential grows in one direction and\ndecays in the other, showing some sort of anisotropy. On the other hand, an important\none of the most important problems in geodynamos is the magnetic field reversal of the\nEarth [3]. In this paper a forcing kinematic dynamo is used as a model for magnetic\nfield reversal in hyperbolic manifold of negative constant Riemannian curvature. Another\nsort of flat embedding, that of Moebius strip into the 3D real Euclidean space E3 , has\nbeen used by Shukurov et al [4] as a dynamo flow in a torus liquid sodium device in\nthe Perm dynamo experiment. Actually the advantage of using the cartesian coordinates\nof the Lobachevsky plane is to simplify the computation and the solution of the selfinduction equation instead of using the radial and angular coordinates of the paraboloid\nor hyperbolic space of constant Riemann negative curvature. Here it is also shown that\nnon-Moebius thin surface flow with ellipsoidal cross-section the magnetic field embedded\nin the R3 laboratory, decays in a non-dynamo profile. Unfortunately in some of these\nbeautiful mathematical models of physical systems one main difficult is the embedding\nproblems of the 2D negative constant Riemann curvature surfaces in 3D Euclidean space.\nRecently accomplished by Klebanov and Maldacena [5] applied the idea of flat embedding\n\n2\n\n\fof the 1 + 1-D spacetime into a 2D negative constant curvature Riemannian hyperbolic\nspace. This suggests that a fast or at least slow dynamo can be embedded in cosmological\nspatial section of the Friedmann-Goedel metric [6]. Also recently the author has shown\n[7] that the AdS anti-de Sitter spacetime leads to a slow dynamo when flat embedding is\nused in cosmology. The paper is organized as follows: Section II presents the fast dynamo\nin Lobachevsky plane. In this same section the non-geodesic equation is computed and\nthe non-geodesy of the dynamo flow is characterized by the presence of an external force\non the LHS of the geodesic equation. Section III, presents for the forcing dynamos and\ncomputation of topological entropy bounds for both examples is given in section IV.\nFuture prospects and conclusions are presented in section V.\n\n3\n\n\fII\n\nGeodesic deviation of stretched particles in fast\ndynamo hyperbolic flow\n\nIn this section, one shall be concerned with the embedding of Lobachevsky plane given\nby the metric\nds2 = y \u22122[dx2 + dy 2]\n\n(II.1)\n\nwhere \u039b2 = (w = x + iy; y > 0) is the hyperbolic plane in its half-upper part. Here\n\u221a\n\u22121 = i is the imaginary unit of the complex plane C. Previously Sunada [8] has given\nan example of a magnetic uniform (non-dynamo) field solution\nB0 = y \u22122 dx\u2227dy\n\n(II.2)\n\nwhere dx and dy are differential forms, on the Lobachevsky plane. Here one shall be concerned with the issue of a non-uniform time dependent magnetic flow on the Lobachevsky\nplane giving rise to a force-free dynamo flow. General dynamo hyperbolic flows can be\nuseful to build spatial sections of cosmological models, as recently pointed out by Klebanov and Maldacena [5] and Marteens et al [9]. To shown that Klebanov and Maldacena\nAnti-de Sitter metric\nds2 = \u2212e\u22122z dx0 2 + dz 2\n\n(II.3)\n\ncan be transformed into the Lobachevsky plane one simply consider the following transformation\nz = lny\n\n(II.4)\n\nx = ix0\n\n(II.5)\n\nNote that the magnetic flow can be defined as\n\u03a6t : S 1 (\u039b2 )\u2192S 1 (\u039b2 )\n\n(II.6)\n\nwhere S 1 is the sphere bundle with the group SL2 (R). The geodesic deviation (or nongeodesic) equation is given by\nd2 J\n+ K(s)J = 0\nds2\n\n4\n\n(II.7)\n\n\fThus since this equation, according to Arnold et al [2] represents dynamo stretching of\nparticles in the flow in the Riemannian spaces of negative curvature, a simple computation\nof the Gaussian curvature in terms of the Riemann curvature tensor component R1212\nK=\n\nR1212\ng\n\n(II.8)\n\nSince for the Lobachevsky plane\nR1212 = \u2212y \u22124\n\n(II.9)\n\nand the determinant of the metric g = y \u22124 one obtains a Gaussian curvature K = \u22121\nwhich yields a simple geodesic deviation solution\n\u221a\nJ(s) = J0 sinh( \u2212Ks) = J0 sinh(s)\n\n(II.10)\n\nwhich shows that as s \u2192 \u221e this particles separation J on the hyperbolic flow \"explodes\"\nin the form of a chaotic dynamo. In the next section one shall find an explicitly solution\nfor the stretched magnetic field lines in the hyperbolic flow and the respective external\nforce to support the slow dynamo action.\n\nIII\n\nNon-geodesic force-free fast dynamo hyperbolic\nflow and magnetic field reversal\n\nAs is well-know the simple presence of magnetic fields guarantees the non-geodesic motion\nof the particles of the flow. After reviewing the state of the art of the dynamo problem\nin hyperbolic flows in the last section, now let us consider a simple new solution of the\nself-induction equation\n\u2202A\n+ \u03b7\u22072 A = U \u00d7 \u2207A\n\u2202t\n\n(III.11)\n\nwhere A is the magnetic vector potential whose magnetic field is given by\nB=\u2207\u00d7A\n\n(III.12)\n\nSince the frame of reference in this case is Euclidean this equation reduces to the following\ncomponent equation\n\u2202Ai\n+ \u03b7\u22072 Ai = [Uj (Ai,j \u2212 Aj,i )]\n\u2202t\n5\n\n(III.13)\n\n\fwhere \u03b7 \u2248 Rm\u22121 is the diffusion related with the magnetic Reynolds number Rm. Note\nthat the Laplacian term is given in covariant coordinates by\n\u22072 Ai = \u03b7Ai;k ;k\n\n(III.14)\n\nwhere the Riemannian covariant derivative Laplacian Ai;k ;k is given by\nAi;k ;k = [g jk (Ai ,k + \u0393i lk Al )],j + g jl\u0393i kj (Ak ,l + \u0393k lm Am ) + g kl \u0393j kj (Ai ,l + \u0393i lm Am ) (III.15)\none also considers here that the Coulomb gauge\n\u2207.A =\n\n\u03c6\n=0\n\u03b7\n\n(III.16)\n\nsince the electric field potential \u03c6 is assumed to vanish. Expansion of the equation in\nterms of the Riemann-Christoffel symbols \u0393ijk above, and assumption that Az vanishes,\nreduces the self-induction equation to\n\u2202Ax\n= [Uy (Ax,y \u2212 Ay,x )] \u2212 \u03b7\u03bb2 Ax\n\u2202t\n\n(III.17)\n\n\u2202Ay\n= [Ux (Ay,x \u2212 Ax,y )] \u2212 \u03b7\u03bb2 Ay\n\u2202t\n\n(III.18)\n\nand\n\nTo simplify the above solenoidal divergence-free equation\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u2202x ( gAx ) + \u2202y ( gAy ) = 0\n\n(III.19)\n\none considers Ax = Ax (y, t), which yields\n\u221a\n\u2202y ( gAy ) = 0\n\n(III.20)\n\nAy = A0 (t)y 2\n\n(III.21)\n\nand the solution for Ay is\n\n\u2202\n, has been used. Substitution of these solutions into the\nwhere a velocity flow as v = V y \u2202y\n\nself-induction equation, (III.18) one obtains\n2t\n\nAy (y, t) = A0 y 2e\u2212\u03b7\u03bb\n\n6\n\n(III.22)\n\n\fand\nAx (y, t) = A0 e\u03b3t+Ky\n\n\u22122\n\n(III.23)\n\nwhere \u03b3(\u03b7) = V0 K \u2212 \u03bb2 \u03b7, which shows that the dynamo is fast since lim\u03b7\u21920 \u03b3(\u03b7) \u2265 0.\nHere the magnetic field two-form [2] is given by\nB = Bz dx\u2227dy = \u2212\u2202y Ax (y, t)dx\u2227dy = 2A0 [\u22122y \u22123 +y \u22124][sinh(Ky \u22122 )+cosh(Ky \u22122 )]e\u03b3t dx\u2227dy\n(III.24)\nOne might take special attention to the boundary conditions of this field, which is spatially\nbounded at \u221e and grows without bound at the origin of the Lobachevsky plane. Note\nthat if one compare the uniform magnetic field strength above, one observes that solution\n(III.24) is a linear combination of uniform strengths in the form\nB = Bz dx\u2227dy = 2A0 [\u22122y \u22121 + y \u22122 ][sinh(Ky \u22122 ) + cosh(Ky \u22122 )]e\u03b3t B0\n\n(III.25)\n\nNote that the minus sign inside the brackets allows us to see that there is a magnetic field\nreversal below and above the line\n\u22122y \u22121 + y \u22122 = 0\nwhich is equivalent to the line y0 =\n\n1\n2\n\n(III.26)\n\n, parallel to the x-axis, as can be seen in any simple\n\nplotting of Bz versus y. In the next section one shall compute the topological entropy of\nthis example of fast dynamo along with the other forcing dynamo in 2D hyperbolic space.\nActually Bz goes to zero as one goes \u221e. Now let us show that a non-geodesic equation,\nwith an external force F (y) can be obtained from this dynamo as\ndxB dxC\nd2 xA\nA\n+\n\u0393\n= F (y)\nBC\nds2\nds ds\n\n(III.27)\n\nwhere (B,C=1,2). Let us now use the following Riemann-Christoffel \u0393i jk components as\n\u03931 12 = \u03932 22 = \u2212\n\u03932 11 =\n\n1\ny\n\n1\ny\n\n(III.28)\n(III.29)\n\ninto (III.26), with V x vanishing, to obtain the following non-geodesic equation\ndV y\n+ \u03932 22 (V y )2 = F y (y)\nds\n7\n\n(III.30)\n\n\fwhere the equation for V x is trivial. Together with the divv = 0 equation this yields\nV y = y2\n\n(III.31)\n\nF (y) = \u2212y\n\n(III.32)\n\nwhose corresponding external force is\n\nwhich is a restoring type force on the dynamo flow. Note that expression (III.31) reflects\nthe parabolic or negative constant curvature nature of the flow.\n\nIV\n\nRestoring forces in non-geodesic dynamo flow in\nhyperbolic manifold\n\nIn this section one shall drop the relation curl(curlB) = \u2212\u03bb2 B used in the last section,\nand favor the forced non-geodesic dynamo flow in Lobachevsky plane. From this point\nof view one is led to use the expression (III.17), and to compute the Laplacian \u2206 = \u22072\noperator applied to the magnetic vector field, in terms of the above Riemann-Christoffel\nconnection. Let us then expand these expressions in terms of the equation by\nAx;k ;k = [g jk (Ax ,k + \u0393x lk Al )],j + g jl\u0393x kj (Ak ,l + \u0393k lm Am ) + g kl\u0393j kj (Ax ,l + \u0393x lm Am ) (IV.33)\nwhich from the Riemann-Christoffel symbols yields\n(\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b7)Ax = [\u03b7y \u2212 V) y \u22124 ]Ax ,y + \u03b7y 2Ax ,yy\n\n(IV.34)\n\nwhere to simplify matters and obtain a very simple equation one assumed that Ay and\nV x vanish identically. The divergence-free solenoidal incompressible flow condition yields\nAx (x, y, t) = y 2A0 (x, t)\n\n(IV.35)\n\nwhich upon substitution into the self-induction equation determines the function A0 (x, t)\nas\nAx (x, y, t) = y 2 ex(\u03b3y\n\n8\n\n\u22121 \u2212V y \u22122 )+\u03b3t\n0\n\n(IV.36)\n\n\fwhere one has used the following flow profile\nV =Vx\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\n=V0\n\u2202x\n\u2202x\n\n(IV.37)\n\nFinally the magnetic field closed 2-form is given by\n1\nB = Bz dx\u2227dy = 2y \u22122xAx (\u03b3 \u2212 V0 y \u22121 )dx\u2227dy\n2\n\n(IV.38)\n\nThis magnetic field vanishes at the straight line \u03b3y0 = 12 V0 and since \u03b3 has to be negative,\notherwise the dynamo would be fast, the region y0 = constant \u2265 0 would gives us a\nnegative V0 and vice-versa. This shows that y0 = 0 is an strange attractor for the magnetic\nflow and the field is also reversed. Note as well that when y0 \u2265 V0 2\u03b3 the magnetic field is\npositive, otherwise it is negative inverting its sign as in geodynamos.\n\nV\n\nFast dynamo topological entropies in Lobachevsky\nplane\n\nTopological entropy is a fundamental ingredient in the construction of fast dynamo action\n[10]. In this section one shall review the subject before stating and prove the main theorem\nof the paper. Two important theorems on dissipative and non-dissipative dynamos can\nbe stated as [10]:\nTheorem 1:\n(Kozlov [11], Klapper and Young [10]) Let v be a div(v) = 0 C \u221e vector field on a compact\n3D manifold M, and \u03bc the Riemannian volume form on M. Assume that a magnetic\nfield B0 is transported by the flow gv t of the field v: B(t) = g t v \u2217 B0 . Then for every\ncontinuos field B0 on M, the increment of the fast dynamo growth rate \u03b3 has an upper\nbound given by the topological entropy htop (v) of the field v:\n1\nlimt\u2192\u221e sup ln\nt\n\nZ\n\n||B(t)||\u03bc \u2264 htop (v)\n\n(V.39)\n\nThis theorem for non-dissipative dynamos and mainly the next one on dissipative dynamos\nshall be used below to prove theorem 3. Theorem 2:\nLet us be given a hyperbolic metric g \u2208 M on a Riemannian manifold M, and a closed\n9\n\n\fmagnetic two-form B as B = dA (dB=0) where A is a magnetic vector potential one-form.\nIf g is a Lobachevski Riemannian conformally flat metric whose line element is\nds2 = y \u22122[dx2 + dy 2]\n\n(V.40)\n\nThus a force-free non-geodesic dissipative dynamo flow associated with that magnetic\nflow possesses a positive topological entropy and topological entropy bounds non-geodesic\ndissipative dynamos in hyperbolic compact manifolds of negative constant Riemannian\ncurvature.\nProof: By assuming the last theorem and applying it to the force-free solution of the\nforce-free fast dynamos of the last section yields\nhtop \u2265 \u03b3(\u03b7) = V0 K \u2212 \u03b7\u03bb2 \u2265 0\n\n(V.41)\n\nsince the last inequality implies the fast dynamo action, this implies that the component\n\u03b7\u03bb2\n.\nK\n\nV0 be bound by the relation, V0 \u2265\n\nNote also that when the topological entropy\n\nvanishes. The computation of the magnetic energy where \u03bc is the Riemannian volume\nelement, is given by\nE(B) =\n\nZ\n\nB2\u03bc\n\n(V.42)\n\nwhich by approximating the integral for y \u2192 0, yields\nE(B) =\n\nZ\n\n1\nB 2 \u03bc \u2248 \u2212 xy \u22123 ze\u03b3t\n3\n\n(V.43)\n\nwhich shows that the magnetic energy also grows spatially.\n\nVI\n\nConclusions\n\nGeodynamo studies for the explanation of the magnetic field reversals of the magnetic field\nof the Earth has been one of the most important challenges in physics and mathematics.\nIn this paper one makes use of a restoring force model of kinematic fast dynamo model\nin 2D manifolds of negative constant Riemannian curvature to explain magnetic field\nreversals. To easy the computations one makes use of the Lobachevsky hyperbolic plane.\nBesides the importance of the subject to physics and geophysics, from the mathematical\n10\n\n\fside one also computes the topological entropy of the dynamo, so important for dynamical\nsystem theory. Turbulent dynamos in hyperbolic spaces, can be derived from this simple\ntoy model and computer simulations by the PENCIL CODE [12].\n\nVII\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nSeveral discussions with A Brandenburg, D Sokoloff and Yu Latushkin are highly appreciated.
