Alexander theorem, pseudoellipsoids, localization principle.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nMARIO LANDUCCI AND ANDREA SPIRO\n\nshare many useful properties with B n for what concerns the global automorphisms\nand the proper holomorphic maps (see f.i. [We, La, LS, DS]), some simple examples\nshow that Alexander's theorem cannot be true in full generality for a pseudoellipsoid\nn\nE(p)\ndifferent from B n (see e.g. Example 3.4 below).\nn\nNonetheless, for each E(p)\n, it is possible to determine, precisely and in an efficient\nway, the class of local automorphisms that can be extended to global ones. In this\nshort note we give a characterization of such local automorphisms by means of the\nfollowing generalization of Alexander's theorem.\nn\nn\nTheorem 1.2. Let f : U1 \u2282 E(p)\n\u2192 U2 \u2282 E(p)\nbe a local automorphism of a pseun\ndoellipsoid E(p) , with p = (p1 , . . . , pk ), and satisfying the following two conditions:\n\ni) there exists a sequence {xi } as in (b) of Definition 1.1, whose limit point\nxo \u2208 \u2202E(p) is Levi non-degenerate;\nii) for any n \u2212 k + 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, the intersection U1 \u2229 { zi = 0 } is not empty.\nn\nThen f extends to a global automorphism f \u2208 Aut(E(p)\n).\n\nSn\nn\nWe point out that the set \u2202E(p)\n\u2229 i=n\u2212k+1 { zi = 0 } coincides with the set of\nn\npoints of Levi degeneracy of \u2202E(p)\n. So, Theorem 1.2 can be roughly stated saying\nthat f is globally extendible as soon as it admits an holomorphic extension to some\nn\n, which intersects each of the hyperplanes containing the Levi\nopen subset U \u2282 E(p)\nn\ndegeneracy set of \u2202E(p) and, at the same time, the boundary \u2202U contains an open\nn\nset of strongly pseudoconvex points of \u2202E(p)\n.\nFrom next Example 3.4, it will be clear that such hypotheses can be considered\nas optimal.\nThe properties of the pseudoellipsoid used in the proof are basically just two:\n(1) It admits a finite ramified covering over the unit ball; (2) Its automorphisms\nare \"lifts\" of the automorphisms of the unit ball that preserve the singular values\nof the covering. Since (2) is a consequence of (1), it is reasonable to expect that a\nsimilar result should be true for any arbitrary ramified covering of the unit ball.\nAbout this more general problem, we refer to [KLS, KS] for what concerns the\nclassification of the domains in C2 that admit a ramified holomorphic covering over\nB2.\n\n2. On the automorphisms of the unit ball\nFirst of all, we need to recall some basic facts on the automorphisms of the unit\nball. Let us denote by \u0131\u0302 : Cn \u2192 CP n the canonical embedding\n\uf8ee \uf8f9\nz1\n\uf8ef .. \uf8fa\n\uf8ef \uf8fa\n\u0131\u0302 : Cn \u2192 CP n ,\n\u0131\u0302(z) = \uf8ef . \uf8fa\n\uf8f0 zn \uf8fb\n1\nand let \u0108n = \u0131\u0302(Cn ) = CP n \\ {[w] : wn+1 = 0 }. We recall that, via the embedding,\nB n corresponds to the projective open set B\u0302 n = { [w] \u2208 CP n : < w, w >< 0 }\n\n\fON THE LOCALIZATION PRINCIPLE FOR PSEUDOELLIPSOIDS\n\n3\n\nwhere we denote by <, > the pseudo-Hermitian inner product on Cn+1 defined by\n\u0012\n\u0013\n0\ndef In\n< w, z >= w\u0304t * In,1 * z ,\nwhere In,1 =\n(2.1)\n0 \u22121\nIt is also known that a holomorphic map F : B n \u2192 B n is an automorphism of B n\nif and only if the corresponding map F\u0302 = \u0131\u0302 \u25e6 F \u25e6 \u0131\u0302\u22121 : B\u0302 n \u2192 B\u0302 n is a projective\nlinear transformation which preserves the quadric \u2202 B\u0302 n = { [w] : < w, w >= 0 }\n(see e.g. [Ve]). This means that F\u0302 is of the form\nF\u0302 ([z]) = [A * z] ,\n\n(2.2)\n\nt\n\nwhere A is a matrix in SUn,1 , i.e. such that A In,1 A = In,1 and with det A = 1.\nThe correspondence F 7\u2192n F\u0302 = \u0131\u0302 \u25e6 F \u25e6\u0131\u0302\u22121 gives an isomorphism\nbetween Aut(Bn )\no\n2\u03c0k\n\nand SUn,1 /K, where K =\nei n+1 In+1 , 0 \u2264 k \u2264 n .\nThe identification of the elements of Aut(B n ) with the corresponding projective\nlinear transformations is often quite useful, for instance in order to establish the\nfollowing fact (see also [We], \u00a76).\nLemma 2.1. Let F = (F1 , . . . , Fn ) \u2208 Aut(B n ) be an automorphism such that\nF (B n \u2229 { zi = 0 }) \u2282 { zi = 0 }\n\n(2.3)\n\nfor all n \u2212 k + 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n. Then the components Fi are of the following form\nPn\u2212k l\nAj zl + bj\nFj (z) = Pl=1\n,\nfor 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n \u2212 k ,\n(2.4)\nn\u2212k l\nl=1 c zl + d\nFj (z) = ei\u03b8j zj Pn\u2212k\n\n1\n\n,\nfor n \u2212 k + 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n ,\n(2.5)\ncl z l + d\nfor some \u03b8j \u2208 R and where A = (Aij ), b = (bj ), c = (cl ) and d are so that\n\u0012\n\u0013\nA b\n\u2208 SUn\u2212k,1 . In particular, the maps Fj , 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n \u2212 k, coincide with the\nc d\nPn\u2212k j\ncomponent of an element of Aut(B n\u2212k ), while j=1\nc zj + d 6= 0 for any z \u2208 B n .\nl=1\n\nProof. By hypothesis, the corresponding automorphism F\u0302 = \u0131\u0302 \u25e6 F \u25e6\u0131\u0302\u22121 \u2208 Aut(B\u0302 n )\nmaps all hyperplanes Hi = { [w] \u2208 CP n : wi = 0 } into themselves and hence\nfixes their poles relative to the quadric \u2202 B\u0302 n , i.e. fixes all the points\n[ei ] = [0 : . . . : 0 :\n\n1\n\ni\u2212th place\n\n: 0 : . . . : 0] ,\n\nn\u2212k+1\u2264i\u2264n .\n\nThis implies that the matrix A which determines the projective transformation F\u0302\nis of the form\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n0 ... 0\nA\nb\n\uf8ec0\n0\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nei\u03b8n\u2212k+1\n0\n\uf8ec ..\n.. \uf8f7\n..\nA=\uf8ec.\n.\uf8f7\n.\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ed0\n0\nei\u03b8n\n0\uf8f8\n0 ... 0\nc\nd\n\u0012\n\u0013\nA b\ndef\nwhere A, b, c and d \u2208 C are such that A\u2032 =\nbelongs to SUn\u2212k,1 . From\nc d\nthis, (2.4) and (2.5) follow immediately.

Proof of Theorem 1.2\nFirst of all, we need to introduce the following notation. For any p = (p1 , . . . , pk ),\nwe will use the symbol \u03c0 (p) to denote the map\n\u03c0 (p) : Cn \u2192 Cn ,\n\np1\n, . . . , znpk ) .\n\u03c0 (p) (z) = (z1 , . . . , zn\u2212k , zn\u2212k+1\n\nWe recall that the restriction \u03c0 (p)\nn\nE(p)\n\u2212\u2192 B n .\n\nn\nE(p)\n\ngives a proper holomorphic map \u03c0 (p) :\n\nSecondly, we need to recall a useful theorem by Forstneric and Rosay ([FR]).\nGiven a domain D \u2282 Cn , we say that a boundary point zo \u2208 \u2202D satisfies the\ncondition (P ) if:\n\u2013 \u2202D is of class C 1+\u03b5 near zo for some \u03b5 > 0;\n\u2013 there exist a continuous negative plurisubharmonic function \u03c1 on D and a\nneighborhood U of zo so that \u03c1(z) \u2265 \u2212c d(z, \u2202D) at all points of U \u2229 D for\nsome constant c > 0.\nTheorem 1.1 and some related remarks of [FR] can be summarized as follows.\nTheorem 3.1. Let h : D \u2192 D\u2032 be a proper holomorphic map between two domains\nof Cn and let zo \u2208 \u2202D be a point that satisfies the condition (P).\nIf there exists a sequence {zj } \u2282 D so that limj\u2192\u221e zj = zo and limj\u2192\u221e h(zj ) =\n\u1e91o for some \u1e91o \u2208 \u2202D\u2032 at which \u2202D\u2032 is C 2 and strictly pseudoconvex, then h extends\ncontinuously to all points of neighborhood V of zo in D.\nWe may now prove the following lemma.\nn\nn\nLemma 3.2.

Then, by Lemma 3.2 and the fact that \u03c0 (p) E(p)\nB n \u2229 { zi = 0 }, the equality (3.3) implies that, up to a suitable permutation of\ncoordinates, f \u0303 satisfies (2.3) for any n \u2212 k + 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n.\nn\nn\nis a local\n\u2192 U2 \u2282 E(p)\nConversely, assume that f = (f1 , . . . , fn ) : U1 \u2282 E(p)\nn\nautomorphism of E(p) such that (up to a suitable permutation of coordinates) the\nassociated automorphism f \u0303 = (f \u03031 , . . . , f \u0303n ) \u2208 Aut(B n )) satisfies (2.3) for any n \u2212\nk + 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n.
