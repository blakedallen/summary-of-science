By studying the relations between the radii and\nseparation energies, the new scaling laws and necessary conditions for neutron halos\nand proton halos are established, respectively.

It is found that the effects of short-distance behaviours\nof valence nucleons at the edges of interaction potentials can not be disregarded.\nMoreover, by means of the radii of interaction potentials, the contributions of outer\nparts are estimated as the criterions of halos.\nKey words: Scaling laws for valence neutron and proton distributions in halo\nnuclei; Single-particle potential model; Criterion for halo occurrence.\nPACS: 21.10.-k; 21.60.-n; 27.20.+n; 27.30.+t\n\nThe exotic properties of halo nuclei have been extensively investigated since\nthis phenomena were found by Tanihata et al. [1,2]. So far, a number of\nlight, unstable nuclei are experimentally found to be halo states, i.e., the oneneutron halo nuclei, 11 Be [3] and 19 C [4]; the two-neutron halo nuclei, 6 He,\n11\nLi [1,2,5], 14 Be [6,7], and 17 B [6]; the four neutron structure, 8 He [1,2,8];\nthe proton halo nuclei, 8 B [9\u201311], 17 F, 17 Ne [12], 20 Mg [13], and 26,27,28 P [14];\nand the one-neutron halo structures in excited states of 12 B and 13 C [15,16];\nand so on. Meanwhile, the general properties of halo nuclei have been gradually understood [17\u201320]. Nowadays, ones have recognized that in principle\nhalo is a threshold effect when the state close to the continuum [18]. The\nnecessary conditions to form halos are weak bound, low angular momentum,\nand short-range interaction. And these conditions are formulated as general\nscaling rules [19,20]. The general properties of halos in the above works, for\nexample the scaling laws, are extracted by means of the square well potentials, because the Sch\u00f6rdinger equations have the analytic solutions. Fedorov\net al. [19] found that some results of Gaussian and surface potentials obey\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier Preprint\n\n26 October 2018\n\n\fthe scaling laws of square potentials. Moreover, Hansen et al. [18] drew two\nqualitative conclusions by studying the asymptotic behaviours of radial wavefunctions for two-body systems, i.e. (1) the states with l = 2 can not form\nthe halo structures due to the affections of the centrifugal barriers; (2) the\nproton halos do not exist due to the affections of the long-range Coulomb\npotentials. Nevertheless, we often find that the experimental findings are not\nin agreement with these scaling laws. Of course, the asymptotic behaviours\nare the same for different potentials. But the short-distance behaviors of the\nvalence nucleons at the edges of the interaction potentials should affect these\nconclusions. In other words, the results depend on the potential shapes. In\nthis letter, we re-focus on the scaling laws of valence nucleon distributions:\nAccording to the experimental findings, adopt the more real shapes, such as\nWoods-Saxon forms, to get the more realistic scaling laws, and to reveal the\naffections of the short-distance behaviours.\n\nFor the sake of simplicity, the two-body systems are considered and the\nsingle-particle potential model[19,21] is employed presently. In principle, it\nsupposes that the nucleus is configurated by a core with a valence nucleon outside. In present work, the configuration of certain single-particle bound state is\nassigned by the experimental results, for example, the binding energy, angular\nmomentum, spin, etc.. The Sch\u00f6rdinger equation of this state can be solved\nby the numerically analytic method. Then the radial wavefunction, the density distribution, and root-mean-square (rms) radius etc., can be calculated.\nThe following points need to be mentioned: (1) Adopt the more real shape for\nthe nuclear potential, i.e. Woods-Saxon shape, f (x) = [1 + exp(x/a)]\u22121 with\nx = r \u2212 r0 A1/3\nc , r0 = 1.25 fm, and a = 0.65 fm; (2) For the cases of which\nvalence nucleons are protons, the Coulomb potential of a uniformly charged\nsphere with radius r0C Ac1/3 and r0C = 1.30 fm is added in the interaction potential; (3) The spin-orbit-coupling potential with Thomas form \u03bb = 25 [22]\nis also considered, because it is influential for some states with high angular\nmomenta (l > 2)and spins. Furthermore, the nuclear potential depth V is\ndetermined by the binding energy and the spin-orbit-coupling potential, Vs.o.\nis varied with V , i.e. Vs.o. = (\u03bb/45.2)V . All the parameters mentioned above\nare commonly used as 'standard parameters'. Sherr [21] pointed out that the\npredicted radii are insensitive to moderate changes of these parameters. It\nascribes to the gross results of integrations of radial wavefunctions. Whereas\nthe wavefunctions, describing the detail behaviours of the valence nucleons,\nare sensitive to some extent. Fig. 1 illustrates the single-particle wavefunctions for two bound states 2s1/2 and 1p1/2 of 11 Be with Woods-Saxon form\nfactors with the standard parameters (solid lines) and with the other parameters (r0 = 1.05 fm, a = 0.45 fm; dashed lines), respectively. The results of the\nsquare well with r0 = 1.25 fm (dotted lines) are also shown. The dash-dotted\nline indicates the position of the radius of interaction potential between core\nand valence nucleon.\n2\n\n\fFor the neutron cases, the current scaling laws [18,19] of the square well are,\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n10.44MeV f m2 /(Sn Rcn\n)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\n< rn2 >\n2 1/2\n\u2243 3.65MeV 1/2 f m/(Sn Rcn\n)\n2\n\uf8f4\nRcn\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 1.40\n\nl=0\nl=1 ,\n\n(1)\n\nl=2\n\nwhere Rcn is the radius of interaction potential (core + nucleon), < rn2 >\nand Sn are the rms radius and separation energy of the valence neutron,\nrespectively. According to the halo definition, i.e. the probability of finding\nthe valence nucleon is larger than 50% outside the range of the interaction\n2\npotential [18\u201320], these states with < r 2 > /Rcn\n> 2 are the true halo states\nin strict meaning. The existence condition of neutron halo is derived form the\nabove equation as yet. Obviously, no halo can be formed in the l = 2 state.\nUsing the single-particle potential model mentioned above, we calculated\nthe rms radii of the valence neutrons for the neutron-rich nuclei from 4 He to\n22\nC, including some excited states. All the states calculated are dominated\nby single-particle states and their configurations are determined by the experiments. As the results, the solid symbols shown in the Fig. 2 illustrate\n2\n2\nthe < rn2 > /Rcn\nversus Sn Rcn\nfor these states. Where the interaction po1/3\n1/3\ntential radius is taken as, Rcn = 1.25(Acore\n+ Aval ), with Acore and Aval are\nthe mass numbers of the core and valence nucleon, respectively. It is worthy\nof being pointed out that such Rcn definition is consistent in value with its\n2\nin the Eq. 1, i.e. Rcn\n= 5/3(< r 2 >core +4f m2 ). For example, for the 11 Be\nnucleus, < r 2 >1/2\ncore = 2.37 fm [21] then Rcn = 4.00 fm, and Rcn = 3.95 fm in\nour case. In the Fig. 2, the solid lines are the fit results for the different orbit\nangular momenta. The forms of the fits are y = a/xb , where a and b are the\nparameters. So the scaling laws given by the Woods-Saxon shapes are,\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n2 0.667\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4 13.5/(Sn Rcn\n)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\n< rn2 >\n2 0.446\n\u2243 4.38/(Sn Rcn\n)\n2\n\uf8f4\nRcn\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 1.43/(Sn R2 )0.180\ncn\n\nl=0\nl=1 .\n\n(2)\n\nl=2\n\nCompared with Eq. 1, it is immediately clear that they are quite different. In\norder to show the discrepancy, the scaling laws given by the square potentials\nare plotted as the dashed lines in the Fig. 2. Then the necessary conditions\n3\n\n\ffor the formations of neutron halos are,\n\n2\nSn Rcn\n<\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n17.6MeV f m2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\n2\n\n5.79MeV f m\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 0.153MeV f m2\n\nl=0\nl=1 .\n\n(3)\n\nl=2\n\nThe actual conditions are more looser than those given by the square potentials. For example, there exist the possibilities of halo occurrences in the l = 2\nstates, although the conditions are too rigour. Without doubts, the conditions\nexpressed by Eq. 3 have the realistic meanings for searching the unknown\nneutron halo states.\nBy introducing the Coulomb potentials, the density distributions of valence\nprotons are calculated for some typical proton-rich nuclei, for example 8 B,\n17\nF, and some proton-rich isotopes of Z=15, 16, etc., also including some\nexcitation states with configuration ascertained. As same as the Fig. 2, the\nFig. 3 shows the relations between the rms radii of valence protons, < rp2 >\nand the separation energies, Sp . The solid symbols are calculation results. The\nsolid lines are the fit results,\n< rp2 >\n2 0.246\n\u2243 1.73/(Sp Rcn\n)\n2\nRcn\n\nl = 0, 1.\n\n(4)\n\nFor the l = 2 states, the data points are too few to get a assurable fit, i.e. the\ndotted lines shown in the Fig. 3. So we do not discuss it here. It is found that\nthe scaling laws are the same for the l = 0 and l = 1 states. We think it is just\nan accident, because of the affections by the long-range Coulomb potentials at\nthe edges of the nuclei. Directly judging form Eq. 4, The necessary condition\n2\nfor the formation of proton halo is Sp Rcn\n< 0.551 MeV. It should be noted that\ndue to the existence of Coulomb barrier, some resonance states of which the\nenergies are positive but lower than the barrier heights have enough surviving\ntime and are able to form the halo structures. In other words, the proton\nhalos could exist in these states. Hence, the actual necessary condition for the\nformation of proton halo is,\n2\n\u2212 0.551/Rcn\nMeV < Ep < VB ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere Ep is the proton energy, VB the height of Coulomb barrier. The shadow\narea in the Fig. 4 shows the region of proton halos occurrence. According to\nthis condition, the existing findings figured as proton halos are in fact the\nproton skins. The location of 17 F(2s1/2 ) state, the most close to the proton\nhalos region, is also illustrated in the figure. The actual conditions and the\noccurrence region should be useful to find out the true proton halos.\n4\n\n\fAlthough the halo phenomenon is well studied, it is still confusion to judge\nthat a nuclear state is a halo state or not experimentally. In general, when the\ndistribution of a valence particle has a long tail, ones say that this nucleus\nhas the halo structure. Such judgment is too ambiguous. Someone may think\nit is no meaning to make a strict definition for halo. But recent investigation\nindicates that because of the occurrence of neutron halo, there universally\nexists the overturn of the sequence of energy levels predicted by the shell\nmodel. It is well known that the shell model with harmonic-oscillator potential\npredicts that the 2s1/2 energy level is higher than the 1d5/2 . But due to the\nhalo state occurs in the 2s1/2 state, in fact its energy is lower than the 1d5/2 .\nAs an example, the first excited state of 13 C is 2s1/2 state, not 1d5/2 . Such\noverturn phenomenon is the signature of halo occurrence and results in the\nemergence of new magic number, N=16 [23]. So it is necessary to define a\nhalo state. Clearly, the nucleon distributions outside the nuclear cores are\nimportant for halo structures. The contributions of the outer part can be\nestimated by [15,16,24]\nD\u03bb =\n\nh\n\nR\u221e\nR\n\ncn\nR\u221e\n\n0\n\nr 2\u03bb \u03a62nlj (r)dr i1/\u03bb\nr 2\u03bb \u03a62nlj (r)dr\n\n(6)\n\nwith \u03bb = 1, 2, where \u03a6nlj is the radial wavefunction of valence nucleon in the\norbital (nlj). The D1 represents the probability of the valence nucleon outside\nthe range of the interaction radius Rcn , and D2 gives the contribution of the\nouter part to the rms radius. Here we suggest to use the strict halo definition,\ni.e. D1 > 50%. Moreover, D2 are usually larger than 90% in the halo cases.\nIt means that the uncertainty caused by the inner part is quite small. Very\nrecently, Carstoiu et al. [24] calculated the density distribution of last proton\nin 8 B and extracted its rms radius. They found that D 1 (2) = 0.29(0.85) for\nRN = 4 fm whereas D 1 (2) = 0.64(0.90) for RN = 2.5 fm. Taking the latter\ncase, they judged that 8 B is a proton halo nucleus. Obviously, D1(2) values\nvary with RN . In order to avoid the arbitrariness, RN should be fixed to the\nradius of interaction potential, i.e. RN \u2261 Rcn . With the same procedure of\nCarstoiu et al., we gained < r 2 >1/2 = 4.5 fm and D 1 (2) = 0.40(0.80) with\nRcn = 3.6 fm. Thus, 8 B is the nucleus with thick skin in nature.\nWith the experimental binding energies, angular momenta, spins, etc., the\nSch\u00f6rdinger equations are numerically solved and the rms radii are calculated for a number of single-particle states by means of the single-particle\npotential model. In this model, the shapes of nuclear potentials are adopted\nWoods-Saxon form and the Coulomb and spin-orbit-coupling potentials are\nconsidered. The relations between the rms radii and separation energies are\nillustrated for different angular momenta. The new scaling laws and necessary\nconditions for neutron halos and proton halos are established, respectively.\nThe actual conditions are more looser than those extracted by the square\n5\n\n\fwell, due to the effects of short-distance behaviours of the valence nucleons\nat the edges of interaction potentials. Because of the existence of Coulomb\nbarrier, some resonant states possibly have proton halo structures. The region\nof true proton halos existence is pointed out. Moreover, the contributions of\nouter parts are estimated by the radii of interaction potentials. The halo state\ncan be strictly judged by this estimation.\nThis work was supported by the Major State Basic Research Development\nProgram under Grant No. G200077400, and the National Natural Science\nFoundation of China under Grant Nos. 19875087, 10075077 and 10105016.\nOne of us, C.J.
