Krakoviack\n\narXiv:cond-mat/0409598v2 [cond-mat.dis-nn] 31 Jan 2005\n\nLaboratoire de Chimie, \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon,\n46, All\u00e9e d'Italie, 69364 Lyon Cedex 07, France\n(Dated: October 30, 2018)\nWe derive an extension of the mode coupling theory for the liquid-glass transition to a class of\nmodels of confined fluids, where the fluid particles evolve in a disordered array of interaction sites.\nWe find that the corresponding equations are similar to those describing the bulk, implying that the\nmethods of investigation which were developed there are directly transferable to this new domain\nof application. We then compute the dynamical phase diagram of a simple model system and show\nthat new and nontrivial transition scenarios, including reentrant glass transitions and higher-order\nsingularities, can be predicted from the proposed theory.\n\nSince the mode coupling theory (MCT) of the liquid-glass transition was proposed in the mid-eighties [1, 2], it has\nacquired a central role in this field of research [3, 4, 5]. Indeed, on the experimental or numerical side, it is very often to\nthe predictions of the MCT that new data are first confronted [4, 5], and on the theoretical side, models of increasing\ncomplexity are regularly investigated within the MCT framework as a means to unveil potential new phenomena [6].\nThe reason for this strong influence of the MCT lies in its ability to reproduce important phenomenological aspects\nof the dynamics of supercooled liquids: First, of course, the slowing down of the structural relaxation when density\nis increased or temperature decreased, but other more specific features as well, like the two-step relaxation scenario.\nMoreover, it makes a number of precise universal predictions especially suitable for comparisons with experiment or\nsimulation results, and, for simple enough systems for which the MCT is tractable as a first principle theory, it provides\ndetailed predictions concerning nonuniversal aspects of the dynamics as well, allowing thus extensive quantitative tests\nof the theory [4, 5].\nIn the past few years, a rapidly growing interest for the dynamics of liquids under confinement has built into the\nglass transition community [7], with the aim of clarifying the concept of cooperativity, a key ingredient of many\nglass transition theories [8]. Indeed, confinement has appeared as a means to impose to a glassforming system a new\ncharacteristic lengthscale (pore size, film thickness. . . ), which should interact with any correlation or cooperativity\nlength developing in it, possibly leading to indirect informations on the nature and evolution with temperature of\ncooperativity. In the course of these investigations, at least for some systems studied by computer simulation [9, 10, 11],\nmany features of the dynamics of bulk glassforming liquids which had found an interpretation in the framework of\nthe MCT have been uncovered. It then appeared natural to compare the corresponding data with the predictions of\nthe MCT, even if the theory had been designed for bulk fluids, and, because the tests were quite successful, the idea\nemerged that a mode coupling scenario was at work in confined fluids as well.\nIt seems thus that there is a clear need for an extension of the MCT to confined glassforming liquids. First, if\nthis theory turned out to be similar enough to the theory for the bulk, this would put the studies of simulation\ndata mentioned above on firmer grounds, and more generally this would provide a framework for the analysis of\nexperimental or numerical data on confined fluids. Second, and maybe more importantly, by applying the new theory\nto various models, as it was done with its bulk counterpart, a thorough exploration of the phenomenology of confined\nglassforming systems would become possible, potentially allowing to disentangle the different physical effects which\ninterplay in these systems.\nIt is the aim of this Letter to provide such an extension of the MCT for a particular class of confined systems,\nthe so-called \"quenched-annealed\" (QA) binary mixtures. In these systems, first introduced by Madden and Glandt\n[12], the fluid molecules equilibrate in a matrix of particles frozen in a disordered configuration sampled from a given\nprobability distribution. The models studied in Refs. [10, 13, 14] belong to this class of systems, as does the Lorentz\nmodel, which corresponds to a zero fluid density limit. Besides the proposed theory will borrow ideas from the mode\ncoupling approaches to the diffusion-localization transition in this model [15, 16, 17].\nThe theory is derived using the projection operator method described in Ref. [3]. In the present problem, the inner\nproduct of two arbitrary dynamical variables A and B is given by hAB \u2217 i, where \u2217 denotes complex conjugation, h* * * i\na thermal average taken for a given realization of the matrix and * * * a subsequent average over the matrix realizations.\nWe thus consider a fluid made of Nf particles of mass m, adsorbed in a homogeneous disordered matrix consisting of\nNm immobile sites. The system has volume V , hence the fluid and matrix densities are respectively nf = Nf /V and\nnm = Nm /V . As in the bulk MCT, the dynamical variables of interest are the Fourier components of the microscopic\nPNf iqrj (t)\nfluid density, \u03c1fq (t) = j=1\ne\n, where q denotes the wavevector and rj (t) is the position of the fluid particle\nj at time t. But, before proceeding with the dynamical theory, one has to take care of certain peculiarities of the\n\n\fstatics of QA systems. Indeed, because of the presence of the quenched component, for a given matrix realization, the\ntranslational invariance of the system is broken. This implies that, at variance with bulk fluids, time-persistent density\nfluctuations exist at equilibrium, i.e., h\u03c1fq i 6= 0. This fact is well known from the derivation, using the replica method,\nof the Ornstein-Zernike (OZ) equations describing this type of systems [18, 19, 20], where it leads to the splitting of\nthe total and direct correlation functions of the fluid, respectively hf f (r) and cf f (r), into two contributions, connected\n[hc (r) and cc (r)] and blocked or disconnected [hb (r) and cb (r)]. A similar splitting occurs for the structure factor of the\nfluid Sqf f = h\u03c1fq \u03c1f\u2212q i/Nf = 1 + nf \u0125fq f , leading to Sqf f = Sqc + Sqb with Sqc = h(\u03c1fq \u2212 h\u03c1fq i)(\u03c1f\u2212q \u2212 h\u03c1f\u2212q i)i/Nf = 1 + nf \u0125cq\nand Sqb = h\u03c1fq ih\u03c1f\u2212q i/Nf = nf \u0125bq , where f\u02c6q denotes the Fourier transform of f (r). For future reference, we define\nthe matrix-matrix and fluid-matrix structure factors and total correlation functions as well, which are given by\np\nPNm iqsj\n\u221a\nmm\nm\nand Sqf m = h\u03c1fq \u03c1m\n, where sj is the\nnf nm \u0125fq m ; \u03c1m\nSqmm = h\u03c1m\nq =\nq \u03c1\u2212q i/Nm = 1 + nm \u0125q\n\u2212q i/ Nf Nm =\nj=1 e\nfixed position of the matrix particle j, is the q Fourier component of the quenched microscopic matrix density.\nIt thus follows that, if one is only interested in the relaxing part of the fluid density fluctuations, one has to consider\nthe dynamical variable \u03b4\u03c1fq (t) = \u03c1fq (t) \u2212 h\u03c1fq i rather than \u03c1fq (t) itself. Using the standard method, a generalized\nLangevin equation for the time evolution of the normalized autocorrelation function of the connected density fluctuations \u03c6q (t) = h\u03b4\u03c1fq (t)\u03b4\u03c1f\u2212q i/(Nf Sqc ) can then be derived, which is formally identical to the equation for bulk fluids,\ni.e.,\nZ t\n\u03c6\u0308q + \u03a92q \u03c6q + \u03a92q\nd\u03c4 Mq (t \u2212 \u03c4 )\u03c6\u0307q (\u03c4 ) = 0,\n(1)\n0\n\n\u03a92q\n\n2\n\nkB T /(mSqc ),\n\nwith\n= q\nwhere T is the temperature and kB the Boltzmann constant. The memory function is\n2\ngiven by \u03a9q Mq (t) = hRq (t) R\u2212q i/(Nf mkB T ), where Rq (t) = exp[i(1 \u2212 P)L (1 \u2212 P)t]i(1 \u2212 P)L gqf is the projected\nrandom force obtained from the longitudinal fluid momentum density fluctuation gqf (t). L is the Liouville operator\nof the system and P is the projector onto the subspace of dynamical variables spanned by \u03b4\u03c1fq and gqf .\nWe now obtain the slow decaying portion of the memory kernel with a mode coupling approach, assuming that\nthe slow decay of the projected random force autocorrelation function is dominated by couplings to two types of\n(1)\n(2)\nquadratic dynamical variables, Bq,k = \u03b4\u03c1fk \u03b4\u03c1fq\u2212k , in analogy with the bulk MCT, and Bq,k = \u03b4\u03c1fk \u03c1m\nq\u2212k , following\nprevious work on the Lorentz gas [15, 16, 17]. Defining the projector P on the subspace spanned by the Bq,k 's, the\n(MC)\nmode coupling part of the memory function is then expressed as \u03a92q Mq\n(t) = hPRq (t) PR\u2212q i/(Nf mkB T ). To\n(MC)\n\ncomplete the calculation of Mq\n, two steps remain. First, a factorization approximation is required to express\nfour-point density correlations into products of two-point density correlations. Following the usual mode coupling\nprescription then leads to (we note Q = 1 \u2212 P)\nc\nh(eiQL Qt \u03b4\u03c1fk \u03b4\u03c1fq\u2212k )\u03b4\u03c1f\u2212k\u2032 \u03b4\u03c1f\u2212q+k\u2032 i \u2243 (\u03b4k,k\u2032 + \u03b4k,q\u2212k\u2032 )Nf2 Skc S|q\u2212k|\n\u03c6k (t)\u03c6|q\u2212k| (t),\nf\nc mm\nm\nh(eiQL Qt \u03b4\u03c1fk \u03c1m\nq\u2212k )\u03b4\u03c1\u2212k\u2032 \u03c1\u2212q+k\u2032 i \u2243 \u03b4k,k\u2032 Nf Nm Sk S|q\u2212k| \u03c6k (t),\n\nh(eiQL Qt \u03b4\u03c1fk \u03b4\u03c1fq\u2212k )\u03b4\u03c1f\u2212k\u2032 \u03c1m\n\u2212q+k\u2032 i \u2243 0.\nf\nm\nA crucial point here is that, since the matrix is quenched, \u03c1m\nq shows no thermal fluctuations: h\u03b4\u03c1q (t)\u03c1\u2212q i is thus\nf\nf\nf\nidentically zero [remember that \u03b4\u03c1q (t) = \u03c1q (t) \u2212 h\u03c1q i].\n(l)\n\n(l)\n\n(l)\n\nSecond, one needs to calculate hRq B\u2212q,\u2212k i = hiL gqf B\u2212q,\u2212k i \u2212 hiPL gqf B\u2212q,\u2212k i. The first term is readily handled\nby application of the Yvon theorem, just as in the bulk MCT. The second one is far more delicate, since it involves\nthree-point connected static correlations of the QA system. Usually, such terms are estimated using the so-called\nconvolution approximation [21] which leads to remarkable simplifications in the resulting mode coupling equations.\nAn extension of the convolution approximation to QA systems has thus been developed which gives\nc\n,\nh\u03b4\u03c1fq \u03b4\u03c1f\u2212k \u03b4\u03c1f\u2212q+k i = Nf Sqc Skc S|q\u2212k|\np\nfm\nh\u03b4\u03c1fq \u03b4\u03c1f\u2212k \u03c1m\nNf Nm Sqc Skc S|q\u2212k|\n.\n\u2212q+k i =\n(MC)\n\nEventually, assuming that the contributions to the memory kernel not included in Mq\ncan be replaced by a\nwhite noise term \u0393q \u03b4(t), we obtain the mode coupling equations for the collective dynamics of a QA mixture, Eq.

Like in the bulk, they involve static quantities\nonly, and, more crucially, they retain the mathematical structure of the typical mode coupling equations which have\nbeen extensively studied in Ref. [3]. Thus, all the known properties of the solutions of MCT equations, in particular\ntheir universal behaviors, apply a priori unchanged to QA mixtures. This means that, in principle, the analysis\nperformed in Ref. [10] is as legitimate as all the analogous ones done on bulk systems.\nAs one would expect, the present theory integrates the previously known mode coupling theories as limiting cases:\nIn the limit of vanishing matrix density, the bulk MCT [2] is recovered, while in the limit of vanishing fluid density,\nthe MCT equations for the Lorentz gas [17] are obtained. Since both limits show ergodicity-breaking transitions\n(ideal glass transitions in the first case, diffusion-localization transitions in the second), the present theory, which\n\"interpolates\" between them, is bound to display such phenomena.\nTo illustrate this point and as a first demonstration of the potentialities of the theory, we have computed the\ndynamical phase diagram of a simple QA system (the models of Refs. [10, 13] would be quite complex for a preliminary\nstudy). This is the one studied in Ref. [14], which consists of a fluid of hard spheres confined in a matrix of hard\nspheres frozen in an equilibrium configuration. Both the fluid and matrix particles have diameter \u03c3, and the system is\ncharacterized by two volume fractions \u03c6f = \u03c0nf \u03c3 3 /6 and \u03c6m = \u03c0nm \u03c3 3 /6. The Percus-Yevick approximation [18, 22]\nis used to compute the required structural quantities. Since we are confronted to basically the same equations as\nin bulk systems, the numerical procedures to track ergodicity-breaking transitions signalled by the appearance of a\nnonzero infinite time limit to \u03c6q (t) do not differ from those used there. We have applied the method which is described\nin Ref. [23].\nThe corresponding dynamical phase diagram is reported in Fig. 1. It consists of two transition lines. On the one\nhand, starting from the bulk fluid (\u03c6m = 0) transition point and increasing \u03c6m , one follows a line of discontinuous\n\n\for type B transitions, where fq = limt\u2192\u221e \u03c6q (t) jumps discontinuously from zero to a nonzero value when moving\nfrom the ergodic liquid phase to the nonergodic glassy phase. Along this line, as \u03c6m is increased, the amplitude of\nthe jump decreases to zero and the exponent parameter \u03bb, which determines many properties of the solutions of the\nmode coupling equations [3, 4, 5], increases from its bulk value (of about .73) to one, its largest allowed value. On the\nother hand, moving away from the diffusion-localization (\u03c6f = 0) transition point by increasing \u03c6f , one follows a line\nof continuous or type A transitions, from which fq grows continuously from zero when the system enters in the glassy\ndomain. Here, as \u03c6f is increased, \u03bb grows continuously from zero to one, the allowed interval for type A transitions.\nBoth lines connect smoothly at a common endpoint E, where \u03bb = 1 for both. Point E corresponds to a degenerate\nA3 singularity, a generic type of topologically stable singularities already known from the so-called F12 model [24]. To\nour knowledge, this widely studied one equation toy model had never found any physical realization until now. This\nresult has important physical implications, since, in the vicinity of such a higher-order singularity, the dynamics are\nknown to display very specific features, most significantly logarithmic decay laws and subdiffusive behaviors [3, 6, 25].\nBeside this specific bifurcation scenario, and formally not related to it, another remarkable prediction of the present\ntheory lies in the shape of the phase diagram. Indeed, starting from the zero fluid density limit and increasing \u03c6f ,\nthe matrix density at which the system becomes frozen first increases, reaches a maximum and then decreases until\nthe bulk limit is reached. The last behavior can be easily understood from simple free volume arguments: Because of\nthe volume excluded by the matrix particles, the larger the matrix density is, the smaller the fluid density has to be\nfor structural arrest to occur. The first regime however is quite unexpected and might be due to a partial relaxation\nof the dynamical correlations which lead to the localization of a single particle moving in the porous medium by the\nintroduction of collective density fluctuations at a finite but small fluid density. Overall, this nonmonotonic behavior\nof \u03c6m at the dynamical transition leads to reentrant type A transitions, i.e., for a given matrix density, ergodicity can\nbe broken both by an increase or a decrease of the fluid density.\nAll these predictions (bifurcation scenario, logarithmic decay laws, shape of the transition lines, evolutions of fq and\n\u03bb along these lines) can be tested by computer simulations to judge of the validity of the present theory. Unfortunately,\nthe focus of the work of Ref. [14] was not on a putative mode coupling scenario and thus only indirect and not so\nconvincing comparisons in favor of the theory can be made. For instance, these authors found that at the lowest\ninvestigated fluid density (\u03c6f = 0.05), the dependence of the diffusion coefficient on \u03c6m was different from the one\nfound at higher fluid densities. This might be a signature of the nonmonotonicity of the transition line in this low fluid\ndensity regime. Another of their observations, made in Ref. [13] as well and not so surprising, is that the inclusion\nof matrix particles slows down the dynamics more efficiently than the inclusion of the same amount of fluid particles.\nHere, this is reflected in the fact that the total compacity \u03c6tot = \u03c6f + \u03c6m at the transition is a decreasing function\nof \u03c6m in the top part of the phase diagram of Fig. 1. Thus, at a transition point, the corresponding value of \u03c6tot\nbeing held fixed, an increase of \u03c6f at the expense of \u03c6m leads to an ergodic system, while the reverse change drives\nthe system deeper into the nonergodic domain. This looks encouraging, but clearly more simulation work is needed.\nIn summary, we have developed an extension of the MCT to the QA mixture model of confined fluids. The\ncorresponding equations turn out to be similar to those of the MCT for the bulk, so that all the applications of the\ntheory which have been conceivable for the bulk, like tests of its universal predictions or quantitative comparisons\nwith computer simulations for simple models, are transposable to the present class of systems. The calculation of the\ndynamical phase diagram of a simple system shows that new and complex bifurcation scenarios can be predicted and\nthat a rich phenomenology could be unveiled by a systematic study of models of increasing complexity. Such a work\nis under way.\nThis of course does not exhaust the question of a general mode coupling description of confined glassforming fluids.\nIndeed, the QA mixture has the simplifying feature that it corresponds to a statistically homogeneous confinement,\nwhile many studies have been done for slit, cylindrical or spherical geometries of the confining medium. The present\ndevelopment should nevertheless represent a valuable means to improve our general understanding of the slow dynamics\nof confined glassforming liquids.\nAcknowledgments\n\nIt is a pleasure to thank W.
