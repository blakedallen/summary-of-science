The key ingredients in the proof are Thurston's spinning construction and a volume rigidity\nresult attributed by Dunfield to Thurston, Gromov and Goldman. As an application, we show that\nthis gives a new algorithm to detect hyperbolic structures on closed 3\u2013manifolds.\nAMS Classification 57M25, 57N10\nKeywords hyperbolic 3\u2013manifold, triangulation, parameter space, Thurston's gluing equations\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn his Princeton notes [29], Thurston introduced a system of algebraic equations -called the\nhyperbolic gluing equations- for constructing hyperbolic metrics on orientable 3\u2013manifolds\nwith torus cusps. He used solutions to the hyperbolic gluing equations to produce a complete\nhyperbolic metric on the figure-eight knot complement in the early stages of formulating his\ngeometrization conjecture. On a closed, triangulated, oriented 3\u2013manifold M, the hyperbolic\ngluing equations can be defined in the same way: We assign to each edge of each oriented\ntetrahedron in the triangulation a shape parameter z \u2208 C \\ {0, 1}, such that\n(a) opposite edges of each tetrahedron have the same shape parameter;\n(b) the three shape parameters assigned to the three pairs of opposite edges in each tetra1\nand z\u22121\nhedron are z, 1\u2212z\nz subject to an orientation convention; and\n(c) for each edge e in M, if z1 , ..., zk are the shape parameters assigned to the tetrahedron\nedges identified with e, then we have\nk\nY\n\nzi = 1.\n\n(1)\n\ni=1\n\nThe equations (1) are termed the hyperbolic gluing equations, and the set of all solutions is\nthe parameter space P(M ). The space P(M ) depends on the triangulation of M. We will\nstudy the solutions using a volume function and representations of the fundamental group.\nIn order to to produce the representations, we need the following topological hypothesis.\nThe edge e in M is termed essential if it is not a null-homotopic loop in M. This is clearly the\ncase if it has distinct end-points, but we allow the triangulation of M to be semi-simplicial (or\n1\n\n\fsingular), so that some or all edges may be loops in M. We will always assume that all edges\nare essential. In this case, to each solution Z \u2208 P(M ), there is an associated representation\n\u03c1Z : \u03c01 (M ) \u2192 P SL2 (C).\nGiven Z \u2208 P(M ), the volume of Z, denoted Vol(Z), is defined using the Lobachevsky-Milnor\nformula [19] as the sum of the signed volumes of the oriented ideal hyperbolic tetrahedra\nspecified by Z.\nSuppose that M is hyperbolic and denote Vol(M ) the hyperbolic volume of M. Using results\nabout representation volume, we show that for each Z \u2208 P(M ), Vol(Z) \u2208 [\u2212 Vol(M ), Vol(M )],\nand it is a consequence of Stokes' theorem that Vol : P(M ) \u2192 R is constant on the topological\ncomponents of P(M ).\nOur main observation is that, just as in the case of hyperbolic manifolds with cusps, we can\nrecover the hyperbolic structure on a closed hyperbolic 3-manifold from any solution of the\nhyperbolic gluing equations with maximal volume:\nTheorem 1.1 Let M be a closed, oriented, triangulated, hyperbolic 3\u2013manifold with the\nproperty that all edges in M are essential. Then there exists Z\u221e \u2208 P(M ) such that\nVol(Z\u221e ) = Vol(M ). Moreover, for any such Z\u221e , the associated holonomy representation\n\u03c1\u221e : \u03c01 (M ) \u2192 P SL2 (C) is discrete and faithful, and M is isometric with H3 /\u03c1\u221e (\u03c01 (M )).\nThe existence statement in the proof of Theorem 1.1 is constructive and makes crucial use of\nThurston's spinning construction from [30]. The remainder is proved using a volume rigidity\nresult attributed by Dunfield to Thurston, Gromov and Goldman (see [7], Theorem 6.1).\nThe only known algorithmic detection and description of hyperbolic structures on closed\n3\u2013manifolds is due to Casson and Manning [17] and uses the automatic structure of the\nfundamental group. As an application, we show that the above results allow the algorithmic\nconstruction of the hyperbolic structure without having to find a solution to the word problem\nand, moreover, we show that the recognition of small Seifert fibred spaces is also within the\nscope of our approach:\nTheorem 1.2 (Casson-Manning [17] & Rubinstein [27]) There exists an algorithm, which\nwill, given a triangulated, closed, orientable 3\u2013manifold M decide whether or not it has\na hyperbolic structure or a small Seifert fibred structure. Moreover, if M has a hyperbolic\nstructure or a small Seifert fibred structure, then the structure is algorithmically constructible.\nThis paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, we summarise some background material\non hyperbolic geometry and prove a technical lemma which will be used in the spinning\nconstruction. Thurston's spinning construction is reviewed in Section 3, and basic properties\nof the parameter space are given in Section 4. The proofs of Theorems 1.1 and 1.2 are given\nin Section 5.\n\n2\n\nThe straightening map for hyperbolic simplices\n\nIn this section, we will prove a technical result (Lemma 2.3) that will be used in the subsequent\nsections. The proof of Lemma 2.3 makes use of both the hyperboloid and Klein models of\nn-dimensional hyperbolic space which are now briefly reviewed.\n2\n\n\f2.1\n\nThe hyperboloid and Klein models of Hn\n\nLet En,1 be the Minkowski space which is Rn+1 with inner product <, > defined by\nhx, yi =\n\nn\nX\n\nxi yi \u2212 xn+1 yn+1 ,\n\ni=1\n\nwhere x = (x1 , ..., xn+1 ) and y = (y1 , ..., yn+1 ). The hyperboloid model H n of Hn is\nH n = {x \u2208 En,1 | hx, xi = \u22121, xn+1 > 0},\nand the light cone L is defined to be\nL = {x \u2208 En,1 | hx, xi = 0, xn+1 > 0}.\nGeodesics in the hyperboloid model H n are of the form H n \u2229 L, where L is a 2-dimensional\nlinear subspace in En,1 .\nThe open unit disc D n \u2282 Rn is identified with a subset of En,1 via the natural maps\nD n \u2282 Rn \u0592\u2192 Rn \u00d7 {1} \u2282 En,1 .\n1\n(x1 , ..., xn+1 ), is a\nThe radial projection \u03c0 : H n \u2192 D n , defined by \u03c0(x1 , ..., xn+1 ) = xn+1\nbijection, and the Klein model of the n-dimensional hyperbolic space is D n with the Riemannian metric induced from H n via \u03c0. Since \u03c0 maps geodesics in H n to line segments,\ngeodesics in the Klein model D n are Euclidean straight lines. The boundary \u2202D n of the\nn\u22121 , and D n = D n \u222a S n\u22121 is\nKlein model D n is called the sphere at infinity, denoted by S\u221e\n\u221e\ncalled the compactification of D n . We see that D n naturally inherits a smooth structure from\nRn \u00d7 {1} \u2282 En,1 .\n\nWe will denote\n\nn,1\nEn,1\n| hx, xi < 0, xn+1 > 0}\n<0 = {x \u2208 E\n\nand\nn,1\n| hx, xi \u2264 0, xn+1 > 0}.\nEn,1\n\u22640 = {x \u2208 E\nn,1\nn\nn\nWe have H n \u2282 En,1\n<0 \u2282 E\u22640 and the radial projection \u03c0 : H \u2192 D can be viewed as the\nn,1\nrestriction to H n of the radial projection \u03c0 : E\u22640 \u2192 D n .\n\n2.2\n\nThe straightening map for hyperbolic simplices\n\nLet\n\u2206k = {(t0 , ..., tk ) \u2208 Rk+1 | ti > 0, i = 0, ..., k and\n\nX\n\nti = 1}\n\nbe the standard k -simplex with vertex set {ei }. Following [30], any k + 1 points v0 , ..., vk ,\n1 6 k 6 n, in D n determine a straightening map (or straight k -simplex ) \u03c3v0 ,...,vk : \u2206k \u2192 D n ,\nwhose image is the convex hull of v0 , ..., vk . It is defined as follows. In the Minkowski space\nEn,1 , the k + 1 points ui = \u03c0 \u22121 (vi ) \u2208 H n , i \u2208 {0, . . . , k}, determine an affine k -simplex\n\u03c3 : \u2206k \u2192 En,1\n<0 by the barycentric coordinates\n\u03c3(t0 , ..., tk ) =\n\nk\nX\ni=0\n\n3\n\nt i ui .\n\n\fDefinition 2.1 The straightening map \u03c3v0 ,...,vk : \u2206k \u2192 D n is defined by \u03c3v0 ,...,vk = \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03c3,\nand \u03c3 : \u2206k \u2192 En,1\n<0 is called the affine simplex of \u03c3v0 ,...,vk .\nA straight ideal simplex is defined similarly. In this case, the vertices v0 , ..., vk are in \u2202D n =\nn\u22121 . Choose u , ..., u in the light cone L so that \u03c0(u ) = v for all i. Let the affine simplex\nS\u221e\n0\ni\ni\nk\nbe\ndefined\nby\n\u03c3 : \u2206k \u2192 En,1\n\u22640\nk\nX\nt i ui .\n\u03c3(t0 , ..., tk ) =\ni=0\n\nThen a straight ideal simplex with vertices v0 , ..., vk is defined to be\n\u03c0 \u25e6 \u03c3 : \u2206k \u2192 D n .\nNote that, unlike the compact case, the points ui are not unique since \u03c0 \u22121 (vi ) = {t*ui | t > 0}.\nThus, a straight ideal simplex is not uniquely determined by its set of vertices {v0 , ..., vk }. Instead, given {v0 , ..., vk } in \u2202D n , the set of all straight ideal simplices with vertex set {v0 , ..., vk }\nis bijective to Rk+1\n>0 . In Penner's language [22], a straight ideal simplex is a decorated hyperbolic ideal simplex with a positive number assigned to each vertex. If a subsimplex of a\nstraight ideal simplex is viewed as a simplex in its own right, it will always inherit the same\ndecoration unless stated otherwise.\nProposition 2.2 The straight simplex (and straight ideal simplex) is natural in the following\nsense.\n(1) If \u2206\u2032 is an m-face of \u2206k so that \u03c3v0 ,...,vk (\u2206\u2032 ) has vertices vi0 , ..., vim , then\n\u03c3v0 ,...,vk |\u2206\u2032 = \u03c3vi0 ,...,vim .\n(2) If g \u2208 Isom(Hn ), the group of isometries of Hn , then\ng \u25e6 \u03c3v0 ,...,vk = \u03c3g*v0 ,...,g*vk .\nProof The first part is true since both sides of the equation equal \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03c3|\u2206\u2032 . To see the\nsecond part, if \u03c3 is the affine simplex of \u03c3v0 ,...,vk , then g * \u03c3 is the affine simplex of \u03c3g*v0 ,...,g*vk .\nTherefore, \u03c0\u25e6g*\u03c3 = \u03c3g*v0 ,...,g*vk . Since the radial projection commutes with each g \u2208 Isom(Hn ),\ng * \u03c3v0 ,...,vk = g * (\u03c0 \u25e6 \u03c3) = \u03c0 \u25e6 g * \u03c3 = \u03c3g*v0 ,...,g*vk .\n\u0004\nLemma 2.3 Let {\u03c3t : \u2206k \u2192 D n | t \u2208 R>0 } be a family of straight k -simplices so that the\ni-th vertex vi,t of \u03c3t lies on the geodesic ray li and vi,t moves toward the end point vi\u2217 of li\nat unit speed, i.e., d(vi,0 , vi,t ) = t. If v0\u2217 , ..., vk\u2217 are pairwise distinct, then as t tends to \u221e the\nfamily {\u03c3t } converges pointwise to an ideal straight k -simplex \u03c3\u221e : \u2206k \u2192 D n whose vertices\nare v0\u2217 , ..., vk\u2217 . Furthermore, limt\u2192\u221e Vol(\u03c3t ) = Vol(\u03c3\u221e ).\nProof The proof is based on the following observation. Suppose \u03b3(t) = (\u03b31 (t), ..., \u03b3n+1 (t)),\nfor t \u2208 R is a geodesic in the hyperboloid model H n , which is parameterised by unit speed.\nThen\n\u03b3n+1 (t)\n(2)\nlim\nt\u2192\u221e cosh(t)\nexists and is in R>0 .\n4\n\n\fIndeed, the result is obvious for the specific geodesic \u03b4(t) = (sinh(t), 0, ..., 0, cosh(t)). Now\nany other geodesic \u03b3(t) is the image of \u03b4(t) under a linear transformation A (independent of\nt) preserving H n .\nTo prove the proposition, for \u03c3t , let \u03c3et be the affine simplex in En,1 with the same set of\n1\n* \u03c3et be a new affine\nvertices as that of \u03c3t . Then by definition \u03c3t = \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03c3et . Let \u03c4t = cosh(t)\nsimplex. By the choice of vertices of \u03c3et and (2), the family of maps \u03c4t converges pointwise to\nan affine map \u03c4\u221e : \u2206k \u2192 En,1 . It follows that \u03c3t = \u03c0(\u03c3et ) = \u03c0(\u03c4t ) converges pointwise to an\nideal straight k -simplex.\nTo see the convergence of the volume of \u03c3t to \u03c3\u221e , we observe that since the vertices converge,\nthe corresponding dihedral angles of \u03c3t converge to those of \u03c3\u221e . Now by the solution of\nMilnor's conjecture on the volume of hyperbolic simplices [12], we conclude that the volumes\nconverge.\n\u0004\n\n3\n\nThurston's spinning construction\n\nLet M be a closed hyperbolic 3-manifold, and T be a (possibly semi-simplicial) triangulation\nof M with the property that all edges are essential. We denote M (k) the k \u2013skeleton in M.\nf \u2192 M be the universal cover of M and Te be the triangulation of M\nf induced by\nLet p : M\nT . Since all edges in M are essential, it follows that if \u03c3 is a 3\u2013simplex in M, then any lift\nf has four distinct vertices. We may identify M\nf with the Klein model D 3 using\n\u03c3\ne of \u03c3 to M\nthe hyperbolic metric, and the natural action of \u03c01 (M ) by deck transformations on D 3 is by\nisometries. Thurston's spinning construction in our context is summarized as follows.\nProposition 3.1 Let M be a closed, triangulated, hyperbolic 3-manifold with the property\nthat all edges in M are essential.

Suppose that for every 3-simplex \u03c3\ne in M\nany two lifts of geodesics in L which pass through different vertices of \u03c3\ne have no endpoints\nin common. We parameterize li : (\u2212\u221e, \u221e) \u2192 M by li (0) = vi and kli\u2032 (t)kH3 = 1 for all\n5\n\n\ff \u2192 D 3 , for each i \u2208 {1, ..., |M (0) |}, pick\ni \u2208 {1, ..., |M (0) |} and t \u2208 R. To construct Fet : M\n\u22121\ne\nvei \u2208 p (vi ) and a lift li of li passing through vei , and define\n\u2032\nFet (vei ) = expvei (t * lei (0)),\n\nwhere expv is the exponential map at v .\nWe define Fet : p\u22121 (M (0) ) \u2192 D 3 by\nFet (\u03b3 * ve) = \u03b3 * Fet (e\nv ), ve \u2208 p\u22121 (M (0) ) and \u03b3 \u2208 \u03c01 (M ),\nf and D 3 by deck transformations.\nusing the action of \u03c01 (M ) on M\n\n(3)\n\nThe map Fet is now extended to the 3\u2013simplices in Te by straightening maps. By part (1)\nf \u2192 D 3 since the straightening maps\nof Propositon 2.2, this gives a well-defined map Fet : M\nf. By part (2) of Proposition 2.2, the map Fet is\nagree on intersections of 3\u2013simplices in M\n\u03c01 (M )\u2013equivariant.\nBy equivariance, Fet descends to a piecewise smooth map\nFt : M \u2192 M.\n\nFor any t0 \u2208 R+ , the map Ht0 : M \u00d7 [0, 1] \u2192 M defined by\nHt0 (x, t) = Ft0 t (x)\nprovides a homotopy between F0 and Ft0 .\nTake the homotopy between idM and F0 to be the straight line homotopy. Namely, for\nf\u223c\nx\ne\u2208M\ne and\n= D 3 , there is a unique geodesic segment lxe : [0, 1] \u2192 D 3 such that lxe (0) = x\nlxe (1) = Fe0 (e\nx). The map H0 : M \u00d7 [0, 1] \u2192 M defined by\nH0 (x, t) = p \u25e6 lxe (t),\n\nf is any lift of x, provides a homotopy from idM to F0 . This proves parts (1)\nwhere x\ne\u2208M\nand (2).\nWe now define a \u03c01 (M )-equivariant map\nFe\u221e : p\u22121 (M (0) ) \u2192 D 3\n\nas follows. For each v \u2208 M (0) , choose a lift ve \u2208 p\u22121 (M (0) ) and let e\nl be the corresponding lift\nof the associated element of L. As t tends to infinity, Ft (e\nv ) = expev (t * e\nl\u2032 (0)) approaches an\n2 of e\nv ) to be ve\u2217 and\nend-point ve\u2217 \u2208 S\u221e\nl.

By Part (1) of Proposition 2.2,\nf, and hence on M\nf. Since each Fet is\nFe\u221e is well-defined on intersections of 3\u2013simplices in M\n\u03c01 (M )-equivariant, so is Fe\u221e . This completes the proof of part (3).\nBy the assumption on the end-points of the set of lifted geodesics, the vertices of Fe\u221e (e\n\u03c3 ) are\ndistinct. Therefore Fe\u221e (e\n\u03c3 ) is an ideal tetrahedron with four distinct vertices in D 3 . This\nproves (4), and (5) is a direct consequence of (4).\n\u0004\nRemark 3.2 The hypothesis on L avoids the situation in [29], where simplices of higher\ndimension may be mapped into the sphere at infinity. In the language of [29], our subcomplex\nat infinity consists merely of the 0\u2013skeleton.\n6\n\n\f4\n\nThe parameter space\n\nThroughout this section, we suppose that M is a triangulated, oriented, closed 3\u2013manifold.\nWe denote \u03a3k the set of all k \u2013simplices of the triangulation in M. As above, the triangulation\nmay be semi-simplicial, so an element of \u03a3k may not be an embedded k \u2013simplex in M.\nNevertheless, elements of \u03a31 will be termed edges and elements of \u03a33 are termed tetrahedra.\n\n4.1\n\nThe hyperbolic gluing equations\n\nLet \u22063 be the standard 3\u2013simplex with a chosen orientation. Suppose the edges from one\nvertex of \u22063 are labeled by e1 , e2 and e3 so that the opposite edges have the same labeling.\nThen the cyclic order of e1 , e2 and e3 viewed from each vertex depends only on the orientation\nof the 3\u2013simplex, i.e. is independent of the choice of the vertices. It follows that, up to\norientation preserving symmetries, there are two possible labelings, and we will fix one of\nthese labelings.\nEach pair of opposite edges corresponds to a normal isotopy class of quadrilaterals (normal\nquadrilateral for short) in \u22063 . There is a natural cyclic order on the set of normal quadrilaterals induced by the cyclic order on the edges from a vertex, and this order is preserved by\nall orientation preserving symmetries of \u22063 .\nIf \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a33 , then there is an orientation preserving map \u22063 \u2192 \u03c3 taking the k \u2013simplices in \u22063\nto elements of \u03a3k , and which is a bijection between the sets of normal quadrilaterals. This\nmap induces a cyclic order of the normal quadrilaterals in \u03c3, and we denote the corresponding\n3\u2013cycle \u03c4\u03c3 . It follows from the above remarks, that this order is independent of the choice of\nthe map. We define\nY\n\u03c4\u03c3 .\n\u03c4=\n\u03c3\u2208\u03a33\n\nLet e \u2208 \u03a31 , and q be a normal quadrilateral in \u03c3. The index i(q, e) is the integer 0, 1 or 2\ndefined as follows: i(q, e) = 0 if e is not an edge of \u03c3, i(q, e) = 1 if e is the only edge in \u03c3\nfacing q, and i(q, e) = 2 if e are the two edges in \u03c3 facing q.\nDefinition 4.1 The parameter space P(M ) is the set of all points Z = (zq ) \u2208 (C \\ {0, 1})Q ,\nwhere Q is the set of all normal quadrilaterals, satisfying the following two conditions:\n(a) for each edge e in M,\n\nY\n\nzqi(q,e) = 1,\n\n(4)\n\n1\n.\n1 \u2212 zq\n\n(5)\n\nq\u2208Q\n\n(b) for each q \u2208 Q\nz\u03c4 q =\n\nEquation (4) is the hyperbolic gluing equation of e, and (5) is the parameter relation of q.\nLet z\u03c3 = (zq , z\u03c4 q , z\u03c4 2 q ) be the triple of complex numbers assigned to the three normal quadrilaterals in the tetrahedron \u03c3. We will often write Z \u2208 P(M ) as Z = (z\u03c3 ).\n7\n\n\f4.2\n\nThe (lack of) geometry of solutions\n\nUnlike in the case of cusped hyperbolic 3\u2013manifolds, solutions to the hyperbolic gluing equations cannot be used to directly construct a hyperbolic metric on a closed 3\u2013manifold, as\nhighlighted by the following result.\nProposition 4.2 Let M be a triangulated, closed, oriented 3\u2013manifold, and Z \u2208 P(M ).\nThen there is at least one 3\u2013simplex \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a33 such that z\u03c3 \u2208 \u2212H, the closure of the lower half\nplane.\nProof Suppose for all \u03c3, z\u03c3 \u2208 H, then by taking arguments, we would have got an angle\nstructure on M, which is an assignment of real numbers, termed angles, in the range (0, \u03c0) to\neach edge of each 3\u2013simplex such that the sum of all angles at each vertex of each 3\u2013simplex\nis \u03c0, and such that around each edge e of T the sum of angles is 2ke \u03c0 with ke \u2265 1. This\ninduces a combinatorial angle structure on the link of each vertex in M, that is, a function\na : {all corners in the link} \u2192 R. Since all 2\u2013cells in the induced triangulation of the vertex\nlink are triangles and have angle sum \u03c0, the total combinatorial area A(a) of the angle\nstructure is zero. The combinatorial curvature Kv at vertex v of the induced triangulation is\n2\u03c0 minus the sum of angles at v, which equals 2(1 \u2212 ke )\u03c0, where e is the edge containing v.\nWhence Kv is non-positive. Since the link of each vertex in M is a sphere, the combinatorial\nGauss\u2013Bonnet formula (see [14], Proposition 13) now implies that\nX\n4\u03c0 = 2\u03c0\u03c7(S 2 ) = A(a) +\nKv \u2264 0,\nwhich gives a contradiction.\n\n\u0004\n\nThe above result is sharp in the sense that there may not be any negatively oriented tetrahedra.\nFor instance, the one-tetrahedron triangulation of L(4, 1) yields the unique solution (\u22121, 21 , 2).\nWe remark that taking the arguments of Z \u2208 P(M ) defines an S 1 \u2013angle structure on the\nclosed 3-manifold M, which is the counterpart of an angle structure on a 3\u2013manifold with\ntorus cusps (see [13] for results on S 1 \u2013angle structures).\n\n4.3\n\nThe volume of solutions\n\nRecall that the Lobachevsky function is defined by:\nZ \u03b1\nln |2 sin t|dt\n\u039b(\u03b1) = \u2212\n0\n\nfor any \u03b1 \u2208 R.\nDefinition 4.3 The volume of z\u03c3 is defined to be the sum of the Lobachevsky functions\nVol(z\u03c3 ) = \u039b(arg(zq )) + \u039b(arg(z\u03c4 q )) + \u039b(arg(z\u03c4 2 q )),\nand the volume of (z\u03c3 ) = Z \u2208 P(M ) is defined by\nX\nVol(Z) =\nVol(z\u03c3 ).\n\u03c3\u2208\u03a33\n\nThe hyperbolic gluing equations are defined over the integers, so Z \u2208 P(M ) implies Z \u2208\nP(M ), where the latter point is obtained by taking the complex conjugates of all coordinates.\nIt follows from the properties of the Lobachevsky function (see [19]) that Vol(Z) = \u2212 Vol(Z).\n8\n\n\f4.4\n\nThe shape parameters of an ideal tetrahedron\n\n2 , i = 1, ..., 4.

Suppose \u03c3 3 = [w0 , w1 , w2 , w3 ], and\n\u03c3 2 = [w0 , w1 , w2 ]. Then define DZ (w3 ) \u2208 \u2202D 3 such that the cross ratio\n(DZ (w0 ), DZ (w1 ); DZ (w2 ), DZ (w3 ))\nequals the edge invariant of \u03c3 3 at [w0 , w1 ].

This is well-defined since the hyperbolic gluing equations are satisfied.\nany 3-simplex in M\nWe therefore have an associated representation \u03c1Z : \u03c01 (M ) \u2192 P SL2 (C). This representation\nis uniquely determined by the map DZ . The only choice in the construction of DZ is the\ninitial placement of a 3\u2013simplex, and it is easy to see that a different choice results in a\nrepresentation which is conjugate to \u03c1Z by an orientation preserving isometry of H3 .\n10\n\n\f4.6\n\nRepresentation volume\n\nGiven the closed 3\u2013manifold M and any representation \u03c1 : \u03c01 (M ) \u2192 P SL2 (C), the volume\nof \u03c1 is defined as follows (see Dunfield [7] for details). Choose any piecewise smooth \u03c1\u2013\nf \u2192 H3 . The form f \u2217 (VolH3 ) descends to a form on N. The volume of\nequivariant map f : M\n\u03c1 is the value of the integral of this form over M :\nZ\nf \u2217 (VolH3 ).\nVol(\u03c1) =\nM\n\nThe volume is independent of f as any two such maps are equivariantly homotopic by a\nstraight line homotopy (cf. the proof of Proposition 3.1). The above is a slight modification\nof Dunfield's definition in that he takes the absolute value of the integral, whilst we maintain\ndependence on the orientation of M.\nWith the notation of the previous subsection, we have the following result:\nLemma 4.6 Let M be a closed, oriented, triangulated 3\u2013manifold with the property that\nall edges in M are essential. Then Vol(\u03c1Z ) = Vol(Z) for each Z \u2208 P(M ).\nThe proof of the lemma is given in Section 5 below. Dunfield [7] proves the following rigidity\nresult for representation volume, which he attributes to Thurston, Gromov and Goldman:\nTheorem 4.7 (Thurston-Gromov-Goldman) If M is a compact hyperbolic 3\u2013manifold, and\n\u03c1 : \u03c01 (M ) \u2192 P SL2 (C) a representation with Vol(\u03c1) = Vol(M ), then \u03c1 is discrete and faithful.\nDunfield [7] in fact proves slightly more (see also [9] for a further generalisation), namely:\nProposition 4.8 Let M be a compact hyperbolic 3-manifold, and \u03c1 : \u03c01 (M ) \u2192 P SL2 (C)\nbe a representation of the fundamental group of M. Then \u2212 Vol(M ) \u2264 Vol(\u03c1) \u2264 Vol(M ).\nMoreover, if Vol(\u03c1) = \u00b1 Vol(M ), then \u03c1 is discrete and faithful.\nPutting Lemma 4.6 and Proposition 4.8 together, we have:\nCorollary 4.9 Let M be a closed, oriented, triangulated, hyperbolic 3\u2013manifold with the\nproperty that all edges in M are essential. Then \u2212 Vol(M ) \u2264 Vol(Z) \u2264 Vol(M ) for each\nZ \u2208 P(M ), and if Vol(Z) = \u00b1 Vol(M ), then \u03c1Z is discrete and faithful.\nIf M is not hyperbolic, the range of Vol depends on both the pieces of the JSJ decomposition\nof M and the way they glue up. The proof of Theorem 1.3 in [8] implies the following:\nLemma 4.10 (Francaviglia [8]) Suppose the closed, orientable 3\u2013manifold M is a graph\nmanifold.

One then extends the map over the\nwhole 0\u2013skeleton \u03c1Z \u2013equivariantly, and over the 3\u2013skeleton by straight maps. This is clearly\nwell-defined given our rigid set-up.\nf, and suppose DZ (\u03c3 0 ) = v. Then let l\u03c30 be the geodesic ray from\nLet \u03c3 0 be a vertex in M\nf. Since both maps, F0\nF0 (\u03c3 0 ) to v. This gives a set of geodesic rays, one for each vertex in M\nand DZ , are \u03c1Z \u2013equivariant, the set of rays is also \u03c1Z \u2013equivariant.\nf \u2192 D 3 as follows. If \u03c3 0 is a vertex in M\nf, then let\nFor each t \u2208 (0, \u221e), define the map Ft : M\nFt (\u03c3 0 ) be the point on the ray l\u03c30 which is distance t from F0 (\u03c3 0 ).

For any 3\u2013simplex \u03c3 in M, we assign the shape parameters zqi of \u03c3\ne\u2217 to the\nQ\ncorresponding qi \u2282 \u03c3, and get an assignment Z\u221e = (z\u03c3 ) \u2208 (C \\ {0, 1}) . We claim that Z\u221e\nis a solution to hyperbolic gluing equation, i.e., Z\u221e satisfies (a) and (b) of Definition 4.1.\nIndeed, by (2) of Proposition 4.5, (b) is obvious.

The fact that this can be\ndone follows from the work of Haken; see Jaco and Tollefson [11] for a complete exposition.\nSo we may suppose that M is a triangulated, closed, irreducible, atoroidal and oriented 3\u2013\nmanifold. It follows from Thurston's Geometrisation Conjecture (which now is a complete\ntheorem due to Perelman et al. [4, 15, 20, 21, 23\u201325]) that M is either hyperbolic or a small\nSeifert fibred space. By passing to a barycentric sub-division, we may assume that all edges\nare essential.\nThe parameter space has finitely many Zariski components and the volume function is constant\non each component. (In fact, it is constant on topological components.) Hence pick one point\nfrom each component. If Vol vanishes on each, or if the parameter space is empty, then it\nfollows from Theorem 1.1 that M is not hyperbolic. Whence it is a small Seifert fibred space.\nIn this case, Sela [28], Section 10, describes an effective algorithm to recognise the Seifert\nfibred structure using the fundamental group, and the classification of Seifert fibred spaces\ncan be used to construct the structure.\nHence suppose that there is a point Z with Vol(Z) 6= 0. It follows from Lemma 4.10 that\nM cannot be a small Seifert fibred space and hence is hyperbolic. Theorem 1.1 implies that\nthe values of Vol lie in [\u2212 Vol(M ), Vol(M )] and that both bounds are attained. Then a\ndiscrete and faithful representation of \u03c01 (M ) into P SL2 (C) is the holonomy representation\ndetermined by a point of maximal volume. The structure can now be constructed as described\nby Manning (see [17], Section 4).\nIt remains to address how to turn the above outline into a rigorous algorithm. The first part,\nchecking that M is irreducible and atoroidal using normal surface theory, is clearly rigorous\nand the routines are implemented in Regina [3].\nThe algorithms from algebraic geometry which are needed involve computations with algebraic\nnumbers over the rationals. Manning (see [17], Section 2) has summarised most of what we\n14\n\n\fneed using results from [1] and [16]; including prime decomposition and determining the\ndimension of an ideal. The ability to pick a point from each Zariski component of positive\ndimension using exact arithmetic follows from the fact that in order to determine dimension,\none finds a maximally independent set of coordinates. Each is a non-constant function on\nthe variety, and one can therefore use standard elimination theory (see for instance [6]) to\ndetermine a point on the Zariski component algorithmically.\nHaving one point from each Zariski component, say {Z1 , . . . , Zk }, it suffices to compute\nVol(Zi ) up to high enough precision in order to determine the maximum point as follows.\nFirst compute Vol(Zi ) up to a pre-determined precision. If each Vol(Zi ) is estimated to be\nless than 0.9, then the maximum must be equal to zero, since recent work of Gabai, Meyerhoff\nand Milley [10, 18] has shown that the Weeks manifold (which has volume approximately\n0.9427) is the orientable hyperbolic 3\u2013manifold of smallest volume. Otherwise, compare the\nvalues to determine the maximum. In the event that two or more values are equal at the\npre-determined precision, one can compute the characters of the associated representations\nin exact arithmetic. If they agree, either of the points will be the desired maximum. If\nthey don't, the procedure of incrementally increasing the precision will eventually terminate.\nThis algorithm is to a point not only theoretical, but also practical: computing volume up\nto any given precision (but subject to hardware limitations) is implemented in the software\nsnap [5].\n\u0004\n\nAcknowledgements\nResearch of the first and the third author is partially supported by the NSF.\nResearch of the second author is partially funded by a UQ New Staff Research Start-Up Fund\nand under the Australian Research Council's Discovery funding scheme (DP1095760).\nThe third author would like to thank Ren Guo, Jingzhou Sun and Yuan Yuan for helpful\ndiscussions.\n\nReferences\n[1] Thomas Becker and Volker Weispfenning: Gr\u00f6bner Bases: A Computational Approach to Commutative Algebra, SpringerVerlag, New York (1993)\n[2] Riccardo Benedetti and Carlo Petronio: Lectures on hyperbolic geometry.
