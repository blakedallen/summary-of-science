Using Galactic models,\nwe construct mock catalogues of microlensing light curves towards the bulge, allowing for the\nuneven sampling and observational error bars of the OGLE-II experiment. As a working definition of a parallax event, we require the improvement \u2206\u03c72 on incorporating parallax effects\nin the microlensing light curve to exceed 50. This enables us to carry out a fair comparison\nbetween our theoretical predictions and observations. The fraction of parallax events in the\nOGLE-II database is around \u223c1 per cent, though higher fractions are reported by some other\nsurveys. This is in accord with expectations from standard Galactic models. The fraction of\nparallax events depends strongly on the Einstein crossing time tE , being less than 5 per cent\nat tE \u2248 50 days but rising to 50 per cent at tE & 1 yr. We find that the existence of parallax signatures is essentially controlled by the acceleration of the observer normalised to the\nprojected Einstein radius on the observer plane divided by tE2 . The properties of the parallax\nevents \u2013 time-scales, projected velocities, source and lens locations \u2013 in our mock catalogues\nare analysed. Typically, \u223c 38 per cent of parallax events are caused by a disk star microlensing\na bulge source, while \u223c 33 per cent are caused by a disk star microlensing a disk source (of\nthese disk sources, one sixth are at a distance of 5 kpc or less). There is a significant shift\nin mean time-scale from 32 d for all events to \u223c 130 d for our parallax events. There are\ncorresponding shifts for other parameters, such as the lens-source velocity projected onto the\nobserver plane (\u223c 1110 km s\u22121 for all events versus \u223c 80 km s\u22121 for parallax events) and\nthe lens distance (6.7 kpc versus 3.7 kpc). We also assess the performance of parallax mass\nestimators and investigate whether our mock catalogue can reproduce events with features\nsimilar to a number of conjectured 'black hole' lens candidates.\nKey words: gravitational lensing \u2013 Galaxy: bulge \u2013 Galaxy: centre \u2013 Galaxy: kinematics and\ndynamics.\n\n1 INTRODUCTION\nThousands of microlensing events in the Local Group have been\ndiscovered by various collaborations, such as MACHO (e.g., Alcock et al. 2000), OGLE (e.g., Wo\u017aniak et al. 2001, Udalski 2003),\nMOA (e.g., Sumi et al. 2003), EROS (e.g., Afonso et al. 2003) and\nPOINT-AGAPE (e.g., Paulin-Henriksson et al. 2003). The vast majority of these are toward the Galactic centre, many of which were\ndiscovered in real-time.1 The database of microlensing events provides a unique mass-selected sample to probe the mass function\n\n\u22c6\n\nmsmith@astro.rug.nl,\nvasily@ast.cam.ac.uk,\nnwe@ast.cam.ac.uk,\nsmao@jb.man.ac.uk, jin@ast.cam.ac.uk\n1 For example, see http://www.astrouw.edu.pl/ \u0303ogle/ogle3/ews/ews.html\nand http://www.roe.ac.uk/ \u0303iab/alert/alert.html\n\nof lenses and the mass distribution and dynamics of the Galaxy\n(see Paczy\u0144ski 1996 and Evans 2003 for reviews). Unfortunately,\nthe mass of the lens can not be unambiguously determined for\nmost microlensing events because of degeneracies. However, for\nthe so-called exotic microlensing events, which include the finite\nsource size events (Witt & Mao 1994; Gould 1994) and parallax\nmicrolensing events (Gould 1992), the degeneracies are partly or\nwholly broken. Astrometric microlensing offers another exciting\npossibility to determine the lens mass (e.g., Walker 1995). Astrometric measurements may become feasible with the VLT interferometer (Delplancke, G\u00f3rski & Richichi 2001) and future satellite missions such as the Space Interferometry Mission (Paczy\u0144ski\n1998) and GAIA (Belokurov & Evans 2002).\nThe standard microlensing light curve follows a characteristic\nsymmetric curve (e.g., Paczy\u0144ski 1986). However, this is based on\n\n\f2\n\nSmith et al.\n\nthe assumption that the relative motions among the observer, lens\nand source are all uniform and linear. This assumption is clearly\nwrong in principle as we know the Earth revolves around the Sun,\nand furthermore, the lens and source may be in binary systems\nof their own. However, as most microlensing events last of the\norder of weeks, the effects of acceleration are not noticeable in\nmost events. Nevertheless, for some events, the resulting departures\nfrom the standard curve are clearly visible. They can range from a\nslight asymmetry to dramatic multiple peak behaviour (Smith et\nal. 2002a). The significance of these so-called parallax events is\nthat they allow an additional constraint to be placed on the lens\nmass. The parallax events are biased towards (i) more massive, (ii)\nslow-moving or (iii) closer lenses. The first of these biases means\nthat parallax events offer a powerful way to detect stellar remnants,\nsuch as neutron stars and stellar mass black holes (Agol et al. 2003).\nCombined with other exotic effects, such as finite source size effect,\none can derive the lens mass uniquely (e.g., Jiang et al. 2005).\nA systematic survey of parallax events of the MACHO\ndatabase was performed by Becker (2000). Bennett et al. (2002a)\nsubsequently published the most convincing long-duration events\nfrom this survey. Smith, Mao & Wo\u017aniak (2002b) have searched\nsystematically for the parallax events in the 3-yr OGLE-II database.\nParallax events have also been found serendipitously in the MOA\n(Bond et al. 2001) and EROS databases (Afonso et al. 2003). Table\n1 is a compendium of the good and marginal parallax candidates in\nthe direction of the Galactic bulge. The fraction of parallax events\nin the microlensing database ranges from around \u223c1\u201310 per cent,\nalthough some events are more convincing than others. Additional\nparallax events have been identified by Popowski et al. (2004), although no model fits were presented for these candidates. Important\nadvances not listed in this table include the detection of the parallax\neffect in the binary lens events EROS BLG-2000-5 (An et al. 2002)\nand OGLE-2002-BLG-069 (Kubas et al. 2005), and in the Large\nMagellanic Cloud single-lens event MACHO LMC-5 (Gould, Bennett & Alves 2004). For all of these events, the parallax effect leads\nto an accurate determination of the mass of the lens, when combined with the other astrometric or photometric data.\nThe question naturally arises whether the observed fraction is\nconsistent with theoretical expectations. This is an important question as the number of parallax events depend on the mass function\nand kinematics of lenses. There have been several previous studies\n(Buchalter & Kamionkowski 1997; Bennett et al. 2002a). However,\nthese studies have some deficiencies. For example, they all used\nregular samplings and uniform simulated errors. Even sampling is\nclearly a gross simplification as there are significant gaps in the\nobservational data, in particular, the annual period (\u223c late-October\n\u2013 mid-February) during which the bulge cannot be observed. This\ngap can be especially important for events of sufficiently long duration, since the asymmetric nature of the parallax signal will be\nmore difficult to detect if a significant part of the event lies within\nthis gap.\nThe purpose of this paper is to conduct a study of parallax\nevents using Monte Carlo simulations for the OGLE-II experiment.\nWe will explicitly account for the uneven sampling, simulate realistic error bars and adopt the same event selection criteria as Wo\u017aniak\net al. (2001), in order to make a much better comparison between\nobservations and theoretical predictions. The outline of the paper\nis as follows. We first present the details of our simulations in Section 2. We then make mock catalogues of microlensing events towards the Galactic bulge and compute the fractions of observable\nparallax events in Section 3. We analyse the properties of the parallax events in our mock catalogues in Section 4. This section in-\n\ncludes a number of subsections dealing with event parameters (4.1\n\u2013 4.3), mass estimators (4.4) and long duration black-hole candidate events (4.5). We finish with a summary and discussion of\nstrategies for future parallax surveys in Section 5.\n\n2 MONTE CARLO SIMULATIONS\n2.1 Parallax Microlensing Events\nThe observable quantities for parallax events are the Einstein radius\ncrossing time tE and the projected velocity \u1e7d on the observer plane.\nThe former quantity is,\ntE =\n\nrE\n,\nv\u22a5\n\nrE2 =\n\n4GM\nDS x(1 \u2212 x),\nc2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere rE is the Einstein radius, M is the mass of the lens, v\u22a5 is the\nspeed of the lens transverse to the observer-source line of sight, DS\nis the source distance, DL is the lens distance, while x = DL /DS is\nthe ratio of the distance of the lens to the source. The latter quantity\nis (Gould 1992),\nv\u22a5\nvL \u2212 xvS\n\u1e7d =\n=\n\u2212 v\u2299\n(2)\n1\u2212x\n1\u2212x\nwhere vL , vS and v\u2299 are the velocities of the lens, source and the\nSun transverse to the line of sight. The Einstein radius crossing\ntime tE is always measurable for well-sampled microlensing events;\nhowever, the projected velocity is only measurable if the magnification fluctuations caused by the motion of the Earth are substantial. The observables (tE , \u1e7d) can be used to construct another useful\nquantity, namely the Einstein radius projected on the observer plane\nr\u0303E = \u1e7dtE .\n\n(3)\n\n2.2 The Galactic Model\nWe assume that the sources and lenses may lie either in the Galactic disk or the bulge. In practice, there may be some contamination from sources in the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (e.g., Evans 1995;\nCseresnjes & Alard 2001). Bennett et al. (2002a) have argued that\nthis may be particularly important for the long duration events.\nNonetheless, the structure of the disrupting Sagittarius dwarf is too\nirregular and uncertain for reliable modelling and so we do not include it as a source population.

Two events (OGLE-1999-BUL-32/MACHO-99-BLG-22 and MACHO-96-BLG12/EROS-BLG-12) have two separate sets of best-fit parameters since they have been observed and modelled by two different collaborations. Errors are not\ngiven, but can be found in the relevant reference. Values in parenthesis indicate the presence of two degenerate parallax fits.

This is the E2 model, as suggested by\nDwek et al. (1995) and subsequently modified by Stanek (1997). It\nis a good fit to the near-infrared photometry of the bulge as seen\nby the COBE. The normalisation \u03c10 is set to be 4.46 M\u2299 pc\u22123 ,\nwhich is obtained by setting the total mass within 2.5 kpc of the\nGalactic centre to be 1.5\u00d7 1010 M\u2299 . The velocity distribution of the\nbulge stars is a Gaussian about zero mean. The velocity dispersion\ntensor is diagonal in the Cartesian coordinates along the axes of\nthe triaxial bulge with \u03c3 x\u2032 x\u2032 = 114 km s\u22121 , \u03c3y\u2032 y\u2032 = 86 km s\u22121 and\n\u03c3zz = 70 km s\u22121 (c.f., Han & Gould 1995; Evans & Belokurov\n2000).\nThe mass function \u03c6(M) \u2013 or the number of stars per unit mass\n\u2013 is the multi-part power-law taken from equation (4) of Kroupa\n(2002). This is an initial mass function and so coincides with the\npresent-day mass function below \u2248 1M\u2299 . Above 1M\u2299 , the index of\n\nthe power-law is adjusted to give a good representation of the luminosity function in the OGLE-II fields; this gives a steep power-law\nof \u22127. The luminosity function corresponding to the mass function is computed in the following way. Baraffe et al. (1998) provide mass-to-light coefficients in different bands for stars of different ages with different chemical abundances. We assume a stellar\nage of 5 Gyr and solar metallicity, then compute the transformation\nfrom mass function to luminosity function by numerical differentiation of this data. In our simulations, masses are generated between\n0.05M\u2299 and 5M\u2299 . We do not generate masses above 5M\u2299 , as the\nprobability distribution is a sharply decreasing function of mass.\nAll the stars with mass below 0.08M\u2299 are treated as dark.\n2.3 Simulation Algorithm\nTo simulate microlensing events, we must pick the event parameters from the probability distribution\nP(l, b, DS , m) \u221d D2S \u03c1S (l, b, DS )\u03a8(m, l, b, DS )\u0393(l, b, Ds )\n\n(6)\n\nHere, \u03c1S is the density of sources, \u03a8 is the luminosity function and\n\u0393 is the microlensing rate at the source location (l, b, DS ). We ascribe the source population to the bulge or disk according to the\ndensity at this (l, b, DS ) and choose random velocity components\naccording to the source population. We note that the source velocity probability distributions are separable.\nThe luminosity function \u03a8 depends on position because of extinction. The V-band extinction at any location is calculated using\n\n\f4\n\nSmith et al.\n\nFigure 1. Four sample light curves from our mock catalogues. These light curves illustrate the different cuts that are applied to the catalogue to differentiate\nbetween no-, weak-, moderate-, and strong-parallax signatures (top left, top right, bottom left and bottom right, respectively). By our definitions, a no-parallax\nevent is one with \u2206\u03c72 < 10. The solid line denotes the true light curve, while the dotted and dashed lines correspond to the best-fitting standard and parallax\nmodels, respectively. For each light curve we also plot the residuals from the true light curve (top panels). The error-bars have been omitted to aid clarity,\nalthough a typical error bar has been included \u2013 note that this is not an actual data point from the event.\n\nDrimmel & Spergel's (2001) extinction law and translated into Iband extinction using AV /E(V \u2212 I) = 2.1 (e.g., Popowski 2001).\nWe generate sources within the magnitude range 13.6 < I < 21.0.\nThe lens mass is generated from\nP(M) \u221d M 1/2 \u03c6(M).\n\n(7)\n\nThe flux contributed by the lens is calculated and the microlensing event is retained only if I < 19. The cut for objects fainter\nthan I = 19 is applied to reduce the problem of blending by faint\n\nbackground sources. Our algorithm therefore only takes the blending by the lens light into account and applies a cut in magnitude to\nminimise the effects of blending by faint background sources. Although, in practise, the flux from the source can be contaminated by\nlight from other nearby stars, in Section 5 we show that our results\nare effectively unchanged if we incorporate a simple distribution\nfor this additional blended light.\nThe differential rate can be written out explicitly as\n\n\fThe Nature of Parallax Microlensing Events Towards the Galactic Bulge\nd4 \u0393\nd2 vL dDL dM\n\n=\n\n\u03c6(M)\n\u03c1L (l, b, DL )F(v\u22a5 )2v\u22a5 rE (M, DL )\nhMi\n\n(8)\n1.5\n\nwhere \u03c1L is the total density of lenses, F(v\u22a5 ) is the distribution of\nrelative transverse lens velocities, hMi is the average mass while\nv\u22a5 is the relative transverse velocity of the lens, as defined in equation (2). So, for the lenses, we choose the distance DL and velocity\nvL from the probability distribution:\np\nP(DL , vL ) \u221d DL (DS \u2212 DL )\u03c1L (DL )F(v\u22a5 )v\u22a5\n(9)\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\nThe lens population is chosen in this step by comparing the relative\ndensities of disk and bulge lenses at this location. Finally, an impact\nparameter (defined as the minimum separation between the lens\nand the Sun-source line of sight, in units of the Einstein radius)\nis generated in the range \u2208 [\u22122, 2]. This approach to selecting the\nimpact parameter means than a fraction of events will be incorrectly\nomitted for r\u0303E . 1, since the peak magnification depends on the\nseparation between the lens and the Earth-source line of sight, not\nthe Sun-source line of sight; however, this problem is negligible\nsince only 0.3 per cent of events from our model have r\u0303E < 1.\nThis prescription gives us a microlensing event for our mock\ncatalogue.\n\n2.4 Mock Light Curves and Catalogues\nThe characteristics of the light curves were chosen to match the\n520 event OGLE-II Difference Image Analysis (DIA) microlensing catalogue of Wo\u017aniak et al. (2001; see also Wo\u017aniak (2000) for\na detailed description of the OGLE-II data). These OGLE-II catalogues are constructed from three years of Galactic bulge observations, with observations taken in the I-band once every few nights\nduring the bulge season (typically mid-February until the end of\nOctober) resulting in between 200 and 300 observations per light\ncurve. The OGLE-II experiment consists of 49 bulge fields covering a total area of approximately 10 deg2 (see fig. 1 of Wo\u017aniak\net al. 2001). Two of the fields are monitored much less frequently\nand a further three fields had no observations during the first season. The limiting magnitude of the experiment is I \u2248 20 and the\nsaturation limit is I \u2248 11.5.\nTo obtain the time sequence of observations we randomly select 100 OGLE-II light curves for each field from the variable star\nlight curves of Wo\u017aniak et al. (2002), and then pick one of these\ntime-series at random for each simulated event in the field. We\nthen calculate the flux for each epoch. To do this, we assume that\nthe photometric errors are Gaussian and scale according to the following empirical relation derived from the variable light curves of\nWo\u017aniak et al. (2002),\n\u03c3F = 5.04 + 3.58 \u00d7 10\u22123 F 1.04 .\n\n(10)\n\nHere, the flux (F) and the error on the flux (\u03c3F ) are in units of\n10 ADU. These fluxes can be converted into I-band magnitudes\nthrough,\nI(t) = 23.35 \u2212 log F(t).\n\n5\n\n(11)\n\nAs stated in Section 2.3, we simplify our simulations by incorporating the blended flux from the lensed star only, i.e. it is assumed\nthat all of the observed flux comes from either the lensed source or\nthe lens and not from any other nearby stars.\nAs a final step, we implement the microlensing detection criteria of Wo\u017aniak et al. (2001). These criteria were employed to\ndiscriminate against variable stars in the OGLE-II DIA catalogue\nand must be applied to our mock catalogues in order to select only\n\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1000\n\n1\n\n0.1\n\n0.01\n0\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n-3\n\nFigure 2.

The top panel shows\nthe time-scale distribution and the lower panel shows the amplitude of the\nmagnification at the peak of the event. To make a fair comparison with the\ncatalogue of Sumi et al (2005) we have only plotted events from our\n\u221a mock\ncatalogue that are unblended, have magnifications greater than 3/ 5 and\nhave baseline magnitude brighter than I = 17.\n\nS/N cut\n\n5\n15\n30\n\nPercentage of parallax events\nWeak parallax\nModerate parallax\nStrong parallax\n(\u2206\u03c72 > 10)\n(\u2206\u03c72 > 50)\n(\u2206\u03c72 > 100)\n4.6\n7.1\n10.0\n\n1.4\n2.3\n3.6\n\n0.8\n1.5\n2.3\n\nTable 2.

(2005). This catalogue of Sumi et al. (2005) is based on events\nthat lie within an extended Red Clump Giant region and are selected to be unblended. We choose this catalogue rather than the\n520 event catalogue of Wo\u017aniak et al. (2001) as no detailed modelling was carried out on this larger sample. In addition, the catalogue of Wo\u017aniak et al. (2001) is affected by blending from unrelated stars near to the source, whereas our mock catalogues only\nconsider blending from the lens. In Fig. 2 we compare two properties, the tE distribution and the distribution of amplification at the\npeak. As can be seen from this figure, the two catalogues are in\ngood agreement. For example, the values of the mean tE are 29.4\nd and 28.9 d for the mock catalogue and the observed catalogue,\nrespectively.\n\n\f6\n\nSmith et al.\n\n1\n\n4\n\n3\n0.1\n\n2\n\n0.01\n1\n\n0.001\n0.1\n\n0\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1000\n\nFigure 3. The distribution of \u2206\u03c72 for our simulated catalogue (solid) and\nfor the same catalogue but with no parallax signatures (dashed). All events\nhave S/N > 5.\n\n3 FREQUENCY OF PARALLAX EVENTS\n3.1 Working Definition of A Parallax Event\nAs a first step in analysing our mock catalogues, we fit all events\nwith both the five-parameter blended Paczy\u0144ski light curve and\nseven-parameter blended parallax model. The improvement afforded by the parallax model is recorded as the improvement in\n\u03c72 . We also calculate a measure of the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N)\nfor each light curve, defined as the minimum value of F/\u03c3F for the\nthree points bracketing the maximum amplification.\nBefore comparing theoretical predictions with observations,\nwe must first investigate what level of improvement in \u03c72 is required to classify an event as a parallax event. This is important\nbecause it is conceivable that problems such as scatter in the data\ncould be misidentified as parallax signatures.\nTo test this, we construct a catalogue of events using our\nGalactic model but generate light curves with no parallax signatures. We then fit these events with both the standard and parallax models and investigate the distribution of \u2206\u03c72 = \u03c72stan \u2212 \u03c72para .\nFig. 3 shows the distribution of \u2206\u03c72 for both the parallax and noparallax catalogues. The no-parallax distribution shows a rapid decline in the fraction of events with \u2206\u03c72 > 10 (less than 1 per cent\nhave \u2206\u03c72 > 10). This rapid decline indicates the minimum cut that\nshould be applied in order to identify parallax events. However,\nwhen dealing with real data, we must also bear in mind that there\nmay be contamination from other effects, such as binary signatures\nand/or problems with the data.\nThroughout this paper, we adopt three different designations\nfor parallax events: convincing or strong events, with \u2206\u03c72 > 100;\nmoderate events, with \u2206\u03c72 > 50; and marginal or weak events,\nwith \u2206\u03c72 > 10. (If one uses the F-test for the significance of\nparameters [see Smith et al. 2002b], these limits correspond to\nlog pF < \u22122, \u221210, \u221220, respectively). Unless otherwise stated,\nwhen we refer to parallax events, the 'moderate' criterion is implied, i.e. \u2206\u03c72 > 50. In addition, unless otherwise stated, we restrict\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nFigure 4. The distribution of fractional error in the recovered projected Einstein radius, i.e. \u03b4r\u0303E = |(r\u0303E,fit \u2212 r\u0303E,true )/r\u0303E,true |. This is shown for our three\nlevels of parallax events, strong (long dash), moderate (solid line) and weak\n(short dash). The large fraction of weak parallax events with \u03b4r\u0303E \u2248 1 are\ncaused by events with r\u0303E,fit \u2248 0.\n\nourselves to good quality parallax events with S/N > 5 (as defined\nat the beginning of this section). In Fig. 1, we show four sample\nlight curves from our mock catalogues. These light curves show\nclearly how the standard model becomes increasingly less able to\nfit the mock data as \u2206\u03c72 becomes greater. They also illustrate that\ngaps in the data (in particular, the three month gap between observing seasons) significantly affect our ability to identify parallax\nevents.\nThe issue of classifying parallax events is further complicated\nby the fact that even though an event may be displaying parallax\nsignatures, this does not necessarily imply that the parallax parameters can be recovered with a high degree of accuracy due to the\ndegeneracies that are inherent in the parallax formalism (see Gould\n2004 and references therein for details of the various types of degeneracies \u2013 both continuous and discrete \u2013 that can affect parallax\nevents). We illustrate this in Fig. 4 by investigating the distribution of fractional error in recovered projected Einstein radius, i.e.\n\u03b4r\u0303E = |(r\u0303E,fit \u2212 r\u0303E,true )/r\u0303E,true |. We find that the fraction of events with\n\u03b4r\u0303E < 0.3 is 64, 53 and 23 per cent for our strong, moderate and\nweak parallax events, respectively. The large fraction of weak parallax events with \u03b4r\u0303E \u2248 1 are caused by events with r\u0303E,fit \u2248 0. A\ncomprehensive investigation into the nature of the errors for the fitted parameter r\u0303E is beyond the scope of this paper.\n3.2 Fraction of Parallax Events\nWe now analyse the mock catalogue in order to calculate predicted\nfractions of parallax events. To do this, we compute the total number of events that have \u2206\u03c72 greater than a given value. These fractions are plotted in Fig. 5 as a function of the \u2206\u03c72 cut for two different choices of S/N cut. This figure shows that for moderate parallax\nevents (i.e. \u2206\u03c72 > 50) our catalogues predict a total of \u223c1.4 per cent\nfrom all events with S/N > 5 or \u223c3.6 per cent for S/N > 30.

The lower panel shows the distribution of event time-scales for all\nevents (dotted line) and parallax events (solid line) in our mock catalogue.\nThe upper panel shows the corresponding fraction of parallax events as a\nfunction of time-scale for strong, moderate and weak parallax events (long\ndash, solid and short dash, respectively). Note that these plots use the true\nevent time-scale, not the fitted event time-scale.\n\ntabulate our findings in Table 2. For \u2206\u03c72cut > 10, the slope of these\nrelationships can be approximated by the following power-laws,\n\nfound 1 parallax event 2 in their sample of \u223c 30 bright red clump giant sources. Although the above results seem to be consistent, a recent study by the EROS collaboration (Afonso et al. 2003) reported\na much higher fraction of parallax events; from a total of 16 red\nclump giant events they identified 2 convincing parallax events, i.e.\n12.5 per cent. We return to the issue of these EROS parallax events\nin the discussion. However, the level of discrepancy (or agreement)\nbetween these fractions must be taken with caution as all are subject to small number statistics. In addition, such comparisons are\naffected by the different properties of the catalogues, i.e. the observing strategy and duration of each project, etc. When comparing\nsuch fractions, we should also bear in mind the fact that our mock\ncatalogues are restricted to events with I-band baseline magnitude\nbrighter than 19 mag.\n\nP(\u2206\u03c72 > \u2206\u03c72cut ) = 0.22(\u2206\u03c72cut )\u22120.71 for (\u2206\u03c72cut > 10, S/N > 5)\n2\n\nP(\u2206\u03c7 >\n\n\u2206\u03c72cut )\n\n=\n\n0.44(\u2206\u03c72cut )\u22120.64\n\nfor\n\n(\u2206\u03c72cut\n\n(12)\n\n> 10, S/N > 30). (13)\n\nWe have also computed the fraction of parallax events on\nreplacing our standard Galactic disk model with a maximal disk\nmodel, in which the local disk surface density is increased to 100\nM\u2299 pc\u22122 . The rationale for this is that local disk stars are good candidates as lenses for parallax events, and so the fraction may be\na good diagnostic of the local disk density. However, while this\nchange does produce slightly more parallax events, the effect is\nsmall and dwarfed by the observational uncertainties.\nThe total fractions from our mock catalogues are in broad\nagreement with a previous study by Buchalter & Kamionkowski\n(1997), which estimated that \u223c1 per cent of microlensing events towards the bulge should exhibit noticeable parallax signatures. The\nresults from Fig. 5 are also in rough agreement with the fraction\nof parallax events from different microlensing collaborations, such\nas MACHO, OGLE and MOA. From a catalogue of 321 events\nfrom a 7-yr survey by the MACHO collaboration, approximately\n\u223c2 per cent exhibited convincing parallax signatures and approximately \u223c3 per cent exhibited weak parallax signatures (Bennett\net al. 2002a). The MOA collaboration found one parallax events\n(Bond et al. 2001) in their 20-event catalogue from bulge observations in the year 2000, i.e. \u223c5 per cent. The fraction of parallax events in the OGLE-II catalogues can be found in two studies:\nSmith et al. (2002b) found 1 convincing parallax event from a sample of 512 events, although a number of parallax events were subsequently found to have been omitted from this 512 event sample\n(e.g. Mao et al. 2002; Smith et al. 2002a); and Sumi et al. (2005)\n\n4 THE PROPERTIES OF THE PARALLAX EVENTS\nIn this section, we investigate various properties of parallax events\nin our mock catalogue in order to understand their nature. We utilise\nthe criteria defined in Section 3.1 to refer to strong, moderate and\nweak parallax events and enforce a minimum S/N of 5. We deal\nwith the event timescales, lens and source distances, and projected\nvelocities in turn. Table 3 summarises the mean and median values for these quantities. We also assess the performance of parallax\nmass estimators and investigate whether our mock catalogue can\nreproduce events with features similar to a number of conjectured\n'black hole' candidates.\n\n2\n\nThis parallax event is the same as the one discovered in Smith et al.\n2002b.\n\n\f8\n\nSmith et al.\nMean (median) values\nWeak parallax\nModerate parallax\n\nAll events\ntE (d)\nr\u0303E (au)\n\u1e7d (km s\u22121 )\nDS (kpc)\nDL (kpc)\n\n32.1 (22.9)\n10.3 (8.3)\n1108.6 (609.0)\n9.7 (9.2)\n6.7 (7.0)\n\n91.2 (73.4)\n6.4 (5.2)\n247.2 (113.9)\n9.6 (9.0)\n4.7 (4.4)\n\n130.4 (105.8)\n4.8 (3.9)\n80.1 (61.4)\n9.2 (8.6)\n3.7 (3.1)\n\nStrong parallax\n141.6 (112.0)\n4.5 (3.8)\n69.6 (52.8)\n9.1 (8.6)\n3.5 (2.9)\n\nTable 3.

The upper panels show the fraction of events that are classified as parallax as a function of lens/source distance for strong, moderate and weak\nparallax events (long dash, solid and short dash, respectively). The lower panels show the distributions of lens and source distances for all events (dotted line)\nand parallax events (solid line) in our mock catalogue. The vertical dashed lines at 8.5 kpc denote the centre of the Galaxy in our simulations.\n\n4.1 Event Time-scale\n3\n\nFig. 6 shows the distribution of the true event time-scale (i.e. not\nthe fitted time-scale). As expected, the parallax events all lie in the\nlong duration tail of the time-scale distribution. While the tE distribution for all events in our mock catalogue peaks around tE \u2248 20 d,\nparallax events peak around tE \u2248 100 d. Although we might expect\nparallax events to be detected at very large time-scales, few are\nseen with tE & 500 d. This is because our simulated light curves are\nbased on the 3-yr dataset from OGLE-II. The microlensing event\ndetection drops off sharply for tE & 500 d, as such long events do\nnot pass the constant baseline criterion necessary to differentiate\nmicrolensing events from variable stars (Wo\u017aniak et al. 2001).\n\nGiven the quality and sampling of the OGLE-II data, it is\nunlikely that we can detect parallax signatures for events with\ntE . 50 d, even for weak parallax events. The upper panel of Fig. 6\nshows that at tE \u2248 50 d, the fraction of events that display parallax\nsignatures is less than \u223c 5 per cent (0.7, 1.5, and 7.2 per cent for\nstrong, moderate and weak parallax events). The prospect of obtaining or constraining the parallax parameters for such short duration events can be helped by the more-frequent sampling and/or\nimproved photometric accuracy, such as that afforded by the numerous microlensing follow-up networks (e.g. Jiang et al. 2005);\nhowever, it is known that such short duration events are affected by\nsignificant degeneracies (e.g. Gould 1998).\n\n3\n\nIt should be noted that the underlying distribution of time-scale is mainly\ncontrolled by the choice of mass function (see, for example, the left hand\npanel of figure 10 in Alcock et al. 2000); however, the purpose of our work\nis to investigate parallax events and so we do not concern ourselves with\nundertaking a detailed analysis of the overall form of the time-scale distribution.\n\nThe fraction of events that display moderate parallax signatures exceeds 50 per cent for events with tE & 1 yr. However, the\nfact that the fraction of parallax events only reaches \u223c50 per cent\nfor tE \u2248 1 yr shows that even for such long duration events, the\npresence of strong parallax signatures is not guaranteed.\n\n\fThe Nature of Parallax Microlensing Events Towards the Galactic Bulge\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n9\n\n1.5\n1\n1\n\n0.5\n0.5\n\n0\n\n0\n1\n\n10\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1000\n\nFigure 8. The lower panels show the distribution of the Einstein radius projected into the observer plane (r\u0303E ; left) and the projected lens velocity on the observer\nplane (\u1e7d; right) for all events (dotted line) and parallax events (solid line). The upper panels show the fraction of events that display parallax signatures as a\nfunction of r\u0303E (left) and \u1e7d (right) for strong, moderate and weak parallax events (long dash, solid, and short dash, respectively). Note that these plots use the\ntrue values for r\u0303E and \u1e7d, not the fitted values.\n\n4.2 Lens and Source Distances\nFig. 7 shows the distributions of lens and source distances. The\nlensed sources are preferentially on the far side of the Galactic centre (see also Table 3, which shows that the mean source distance\nfor all events is 9.7 kpc), as these sources have more foreground\nlensing stars, i.e. the optical depth is greater for sources behind the\nGalactic centre. They will appear fainter (Stanek 1995) and may\nhave different proper motions from the overall population of stars\n(Mao & Paczy\u0144ski 2002).\nFrom Fig. 7, it can be seen that nearby lenses are favoured\nfor parallax events. This is due to the fact that nearby lenses have\nsmaller values of \u1e7d and r\u0303E owing to the smaller projection factor\n(see Section 4.3).\nIt has been suggested (e.g., Smith et al. 2002b) that parallax\nevents may be preferentially caused by so-called disk-disk lensing, which refers to events in which both the source and lens lie in\nthe disk. For such events the lens, source and observer are all corotating with the Galactic disk, producing small relative transverse\nvelocities and hence enhancing the probability of detecting parallax\nsignatures. This phenomenon can be seen in the right-hand panel\nof Fig. 7, which exhibits a peak in the fraction of parallax events\nfor nearby sources. However, the ratio of parallax events with disk\nsources is reduced due to the fact that the overall density of sources\nin the near side of the disk is only small. For our Galactic model\nwe predict that \u223c5 per cent of parallax events have lensed sources\nlying within 5 kpc, which is a significant fraction when one considers that only 0.5 per cent of all microlensing events have sources\nlocated in this region.\nIn Table 4, we compare the relative abundance of parallax\n\nevents within the different lens-source configurations, such as for\ndisk-bulge events (i.e. events in which the lens is in the disk and\nthe source is in the bulge), etc. Clearly, one can see that the majority of parallax events are due to the disk-disk and disk-bulge events,\nnamely \u223c 33 and \u223c 38 per cent respectively. This can be contrasted\nwith the most common configuration for all microlensing events,\nwhich is bulge-bulge. Note that our parallax events have \u223c 5 per\ncent of sources within 5 kpc, which is slightly larger than the estimate of less than 3 per cent that was predicted by the simulations\nof Bennett et al. (2002a).\n4.3 Projected Einstein Radius and Projected Lens Velocity\nFig. 8 plots the distribution of the Einstein radius projected into the\nobserver plane r\u0303E and the projected velocity \u1e7d for all events and\nfor parallax events. This shows that parallax signatures are more\nreadily detectable for events with small values of r\u0303E and \u1e7d, as predicted by Smith et al. (2002a). This can be understood, on considering that the projected velocity of the lens should be comparable to\n(and preferably less than) the orbital velocity of the Earth, which is\nv\u2295 \u223c 30 km s\u22121 . The reason why smaller values of r\u0303E are favoured\nis because this parameter determines the length scale on which the\nmagnification is calculated. This means that the magnitude of the\ndeviations is determined by the magnitude of the Earth's motion\nrelative to this projected Einstein radius, i.e. in general, the larger\nthe projected Einstein radius, the smaller the deviations. In Fig. 9,\nwe show the joint distribution of tE and \u1e7d, which \u2013 as expected \u2013\nshows that parallax events preferentially have large tE and small \u1e7d.\nFrom this figure, it is clear that the ability to detect parallax signatures is controlled by the quantity \u1e7d/tE = r\u0303E /tE2 .

(2002a) used a different nomenclature, defining all stars within 3.5 kpc of the Galactic centre as \"bulge\" and all stars outside 3.5 kpc of the Galactic\ncentre as \"disk\". To enable comparison with Bennett et al.'s results, we give in parentheses the values corresponding to these definitions. Note that the disk-disk\nevents are subdivided according to whether the disk stars reside on the near- and far-side of the Galactic centre.\n\n1000\n\n100\n\n10\n\n1\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1000\n\nFigure 9. Contour plot showing the joint distribution of event time-scale\nand projected lens velocity on the observer plane for all events (dotted) and\nparallax events (solid). The four diagonal lines indicate constant \u1e7d/tE =\nr\u0303E /tE2 = 10.0, 1, 0.1, 0.01 km s\u22121 day\u22121 . If we approximate the Earth's projected acceleration to be a \u2248 0.3 km s\u22121 day\u22121 (i.e. averaged over the whole\nyear), then these contours correspond to A = a/(\u1e7d/tE ) \u2248 0.03, 0.3, 3, 30.\nThis dimensionless acceleration parameter A effectively controls the significance of the parallax deviations (see Section 4.3).\n\nceleration a, the dimensionless parameter A = a/(r\u0303E /tE2 ) describes\nthe deviation of the trajectory from a straight line (Smith, Mao &\nPaczy\u0144ski 2003b). Parallax deviations are caused by the Earth's orbital acceleration. Although the magnitude of this acceleration is\nconstant in the ecliptic plane, when projected into the lens plane\nit is no longer constant and so a varies throughout the year. However, most parallax events last for a sufficiently long duration for\nthe average value of a to be used. This means that the quantity\nr\u0303E /tE2 effectively determines the value of A and hence controls the\nsignificance of the deviation due to the Earth's motion, i.e. a larger\nr\u0303E /tE2 indicates that the parallax effect will be more difficult to detect and vice versa. We return to the issue of the r\u0303E distribution in\nthe discussion, where we compare our predictions to the observed\ndistribution.\n\nFor a parallax event, it is possible to determine the orientation of \u1e7d, from which we can gain additional information regarding\nthe event. In Fig. 10, we show the distribution of this angle transformed into Galactic coordinates (\u03b8G ), where \u03b8G is measured from\nthe Galactic plane (in the direction of rotation) towards the North\nGalactic pole. From this figure, it can be seen that parallax events\npreferentially have \u1e7d orientated in a direction parallel to the ecliptic\nplane. This can be understood when one considers that trajectories\nperpendicular to the ecliptic plane will have less time to be affected\nby the Earth's motion, compared to trajectories that pass parallel\nto the ecliptic plane, i.e. for perpendicular trajectories the Earth's\nacceleration will only affect the peak of the light curve (Bennett\net al. 2002a). The orientation of \u1e7d is also affected by the fact that\nparallax events are commonly due to bulge sources being lensed by\nforeground disk stars (see Section 4.2). For the disk-bulge configuration \u1e7d is, on average, orientated along the direction of rotation\nof the Galactic plane owing to the fact that the Sun and the lenses\nshare a common motion in the plane of the disk. This enhances the\nfraction of parallax events with \u221290\u25e6 < \u03b8G < 90\u25e6 , as can be seen\nfrom Fig. 10.\nWe also investigated the radial velocities of the source stars for\nour mock catalogues. No significant difference was found between\nthe parallax events and all lensed sources.\n4.4 Mass Estimators\nBennett et al. (2002a) and Agol et al. (2002) proposed very similar\ntechniques for estimating the mass of the lens for parallax events.\nUsing our mock catalogues, we can assess the reliability of their\nestimator.\nAgol et al. (2002) assume that the source and lens populations are both characterised by Gaussian velocity distributions with\nmeans hvL i and hvS i and dispersions \u03c3L and \u03c3S , diagonalised in\nGalactic longitude and latitude (l, b). Specialising to the case of a\npower-law mass function n(m) \u221d m\u2212\u03b2 , Agol et al.'s (2002) maximum likelihood estimator becomes:\n\uf8ee \uf8eb 2\n\uf8f6\uf8f9\n\uf8ef\uf8ef \uf8ec\uf8ec v\nv2 \uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8fa\uf8fa\n\u03c1L (x)\nL(x|\u1e7d, tE ) \u221d x\u03b2\u22121 (1 \u2212 x)5\u2212\u03b2\n(14)\nexp \uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8ef\uf8f0\u2212 \uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed l2 + b2 \uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fa\uf8fb ,\n\u03c3\u03c3\n2\u03c3\n2\u03c3\nl\n\nb\n\nL,l\n\nL,b\n\nwhere\n\n(vl , vb ) = hvL i \u2212 xhvS i \u2212 (1 \u2212 x)(v\u2299 + \u1e7d),\n\n(15)\n\nand\n\u03c32l = \u03c32L,l + x2 \u03c32S ,l ,\n\n\u03c32b = \u03c32L,b + x2 \u03c32S ,b .\n\n(16)\n\nL(x|\u1e7d, tE ) gives the likelihood of a lens lying at a fractional distance\n\n\fThe Nature of Parallax Microlensing Events Towards the Galactic Bulge\n\n11\n\nFigure 10. The lower panel shows the distribution of the projected velocity angle, \u03b8G , for all events (dotted line) and moderate parallax events (solid line)\nin our mock catalogue. \u03b8G is measured in Galactic coordinates from the Galactic plane (in the direction of rotation) towards the North Galactic pole. The\ninset shows the projected velocity distribution in Galactic coordinates, where the horizontal axis corresponds to the direction of rotation and the vertical axis\ncorresponds to the North Galactic Pole. The contours correspond to the 68.3% and 95.4% confidence intervals. The upper panels show the fraction of events\nthat are classified as moderate parallax events as a function of the projected velocity angle. The dashed lines denote the orientation of the ecliptic plane in this\ncoordinate system.\n\nx = DL /DS , given the observables \u1e7d and tE . This is obtained using\nBayes' theorem, assuming uniform priors in lens distance and no\nerrors on the velocity and timescale measurements. It can be converted to a likelihood in mass m using\nm(x) =\n\n\u1e7d2 tE2 c2 (1 \u2212 x)\n.\n4GxDS\n\n(17)\n\nAs the mass functions in our simulations are more complicated than\nsimple power-laws, we explore two different choices, namely \u03b2 = 0\nand \u03b2 = 1.5. In the latter case, equation (14) reduces to a formula\nproposed by Bennett et al. (2002a).\nThe estimator also assumes that the distance of the source DS\nis known and that the lensing population is identifiable, so that an\ninformed choice for the density \u03c1L can be made. We extracted 728\nevents from our mock catalogue that pass Wo\u017aniak et al.'s (2001)\ncriteria. These are moderate parallax events with \u2206\u03c72 > 50 and\nS /N > 5. We use the fitted values of \u1e7d, tE , together with the known\nsource distance DS and the known type of deflector population to\ncompute the estimated mass. Of course, the accuracy in the estimate\ncan be calculated, as the true mass is known.\nFig. 11 shows histograms of the logarithm of the ratio of the\nrecovered mass to the true mass for the 89 events caused by bulge\ndeflectors (left panels) and 639 events caused by disk deflectors\n(right panels) using the likelihood estimator with \u03b2 = 1.5 and \u03b2 = 0.\nFor the bulge lenses, both estimators give a similar performance\nwith mean percentage errors of \u221222 per cent (\u03b2 = 0) and \u221245 per\ncent (\u03b2 = 1.5). A negative value of the mean percentage error implies that the estimators typically underestimate the mass. For the\n\ndisk lenses the estimators tend to overestimate the mass, with a\nmean percentage error of 85 per cent for \u03b2 = 0, compared to 20 per\ncent for \u03b2 = 1.5. The simulations use more complicated mass functions than power-laws. It is noteworthy that the effect of using a\nsimple power-law mass function in the likelihood estimator (which\nis needed to perform the integrals) is to cause systematic offsets in\nthe recovered masses as compared to the true masses.\nThe interpretation of the effectiveness of these mass estimators\nsuffers from an additional complication. As was shown in Section\n3.1, the accurate recovery of the parallax parameters such as \u1e7d is\nnot guaranteed, even for our convincing parallax events (see Fig.\n4). Clearly these mass estimators cannot be expected to perform\nreliably if the parallax parameters have not been determined accurately from the observed light curves.\n4.5 Long Duration Events and Black Hole Candidate Lenses\nOur simulations can also be used to investigate the nature of observed long duration microlensing events, a number of which have\nbeen speculated to be caused by black hole lenses.\nIn our model, we do not include any stellar remnant populations. However, white dwarfs (M \u223c 0.6 M\u2299 ), neutron stars\n(M \u223c 1.4 M\u2299 ) and black holes (M \u223c several M\u2299 ) must exist in the\nGalactic disk, and so their contribution to parallax events is not accounted for in our model. For long durations (tE & 100 d), the timescale distribution asymptotically approaches a power-law (Mao &\nPaczy\u0144ski 1996). As a result, the fraction of events contributed by\nstellar remnants reaches an asymptotic value, determined entirely\n\n\f12\n\nSmith et al.\n20\nBulge\n\n80\n\nDisk\n\n15\n60\n10\n\n40\n\n5\n\n20\n\n0\n\n0\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n20\nBulge\n\n80\n\nDisk\n\n15\n60\n10\n\n40\n\n5\n\n20\n\n0\n\n0\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n-2\n\nFigure 11. The error distributions of the estimators of the mass of the lens of a parallax event using \u03b2 = 1.5 (above) and \u03b2 = 0 (below) in equation (14). The\nresults for bulge deflectors are shown on the left, those for disk deflectors on the right. The abscissa is the logarithm of the ratio of the recovered to the true\nmass.\n\nby the mass function. The relative fraction is weighted according\nto \u223c M 2 n(M)dM, and hence favours massive lenses (Agol et al.\n2002). If we adopt a mass function for stellar remnants (e.g., Gould\n2000; Han & Gould 2003), we find that the fraction of long duration events contributed by stellar remnants is about 56 per cent.\nTherefore our predicted parallax fraction may be too low by a factor of \u223c2. However, in reality, the discrepancy may be less than this\nbecause on average massive stellar remnants will have larger r\u0303E and\ncorrespondingly a reduced probability of exhibiting parallax signatures (see Fig. 8 and Section 4.3). In addition, since the baseline\nof our mock light curves is only 3 yr, events with such long timescales may not have been considered in this analysis. For a mock\nevent to be included in our parallax catalogue, we require a constant\nbaseline, which excludes exceptionally long duration events.\nTo date, the most promising candidate black hole event is\nOGLE-1999-BUL-32/MACHO-99-BLG-22 (Mao et al. 2002; Bennett et al. 2002b). This event, along with an additional two\nevents MACHO-96-BLG-5 and MACHO-98-BLG-6 (Bennett et al.\n2002a), have been analysed by Agol et al. (2002). In this paper, they\nused their mass estimator (see equation 14) to conclude that event\nOGLE-1999-BUL-32 has a probability of 76 per cent of being\ncaused by a black hole lens (with the remaining two events having\nprobabilities less than 20 per cent). The event parameters tE and r\u0303E\nfor these three events can be found in Table 1. In addition to tE and\nr\u0303E , Agol et al. (2002) also incorporated the angle of the projected\nvelocity \u03b8G and the lower limit on the lens magnitude into their estimator. For events OGLE-1999-BUL-32, MACHO-96-BLG-5 and\nMACHO-98-BLG-6, the respective angles and I-band lens magnitude constraints are: 142\u25e6 , IL > 18.6; \u221220\u25e6 , IL > 18.6; \u221268\u25e6 . The\nlower limit for the I-band lens magnitude of event MACHO-98-\n\nBLG-6 is unknown since Bennett et al. (2002a) only constrain the\nV-band magnitude.\nUsing our simulations we now attempt to determine whether\nthe observed characteristics of these events are consistent with our\nstellar population (that contains no remnants). In Fig. 12, we calculate the joint probability distribution of the parameters r\u0303E and tE\nfor the three black hole candidate events; for each event, we plot\nthe probability distributions for the mock events that match the observed \u03b8G and have lens magnitudes fainter than the required limit.\nNote that here we do not incorporate the OGLE-II event detection\nefficiency, since many of these long duration events will be omitted due to the 3-yr baseline of the experiment. From this figure, it\ncan be concluded that although the properties of event MACHO1998-BLG-6 are consistent with what is predicted from our simulations, the remaining two events, especially OGLE-1999-BUL32, are clearly inconsistent. However, such large values of r\u0303E can\nbe obtained by having the lens and source close together, such as\nfrom bulge self-lensing. Although bulge self-lensing events typically have a shorter time-scale (with a mean tE of 26.3 d versus 32.1\nd for all events), if the Galactic model incorporated the streaming\nmotion of the bar then it may be feasible to obtain both large r\u0303E and\ntE simultaneously.\n\n5 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\nThis paper has investigated the properties of parallax microlensing events towards the Galactic bulge. The expected fraction of\nparallax events based on standard models of the Galaxy is of the\norder of a few per cent, which is compatible with most observed\nfindings. However, it should be noted that observed catalogues fea-\n\n\fThe Nature of Parallax Microlensing Events Towards the Galactic Bulge\n\n13\n\nFigure 12.

Note that since one might na\u0131\u0308vely suspect that (V \u2212 I)L & 1.0, the true\ncontours should lie somewhere between the dotted and solid contours presented here.\n\nture other types of exotic microlensing events, such as binary-lens\nevents (see Jaroszy\u0144ski 2002) and binary-source (xallarap) events,\nmany of which can mimic parallax signatures and hence display an\nimprovement in \u03c72 when fit with a parallax model (e.g. Smith et\nal. 2002b). Although our predicted parallax fractions seem consistent with observed catalogues, there is one exception, namely the\nresults from the EROS collaboration (Afonso et al. 2003). In this\npaper, they report a fraction approximately 12.5 per cent, which\nis even more surprising when one considers that this catalogue is\nfrom clump-giant sources, which supposedly reside in the bulge;\nour simulations predict that the fraction of parallax events for bulge\nsources is only \u223c 1 per cent. It could be argued that the EROS\nsource stars are bright red clump giant stars and as such may have\nhigher S/N than our simulations. However, even if we restrict our\nsimulations to bright bulge source stars with high S/N, the percentage of events with convincing parallax signatures is only 2 per cent;\ngiven this predicted fraction, the probability that such a sample of\n16 events will yield two parallax events is only 0.04. Therefore,\nalthough no strong conclusions can be made, it seems that this observed fraction of parallax events from the EROS catalogue may be\ninconsistent with our simulations.\n\nOur models have one major shortcoming, namely that we only\nincluded blending from the lenses themselves, i.e. we did not include blending from nearby unrelated stars. We attempted to limit\nthis problem by only considering sources brighter than I = 19,\nsince it is commonly assumed that such bright sources are less af-\n\nfected by blending.4 To test what effect blending from unrelated\nstars would have on our simulations, we perform the following\nsimple investigation; we generate an additional catalogue of mock\nevents with blending ratio (i.e. ratio of source flux to total baseline\nflux) distributed uniformly between zero and one. This means that\nthe source stars for the blended catalogue are fainter than the corresponding source star in the unblended catalogue. Although the\nmean time-scale of observed events (tE ) is practically unchanged in\nthis new catalogue, the overall fraction of parallax events is slightly\nreduced due to the greater number of lower signal-to-noise ratio\nevents, which can be expected since the source stars are fainter for\nthe blended catalogue. Currently, it is unclear how blending varies\nas a function of source magnitude and event time-scales, so we\ncannot address this question quantitatively. However, the qualitative differences between all microlensing and parallax events (i.e.\nthe distributions shown in Section 4) appear unchanged from this\nanalysis of blending.\nTo obtain a greater understanding of the underlying nature of\nparallax events, we examined the distributions of the event parameters tE and \u1e7d (or, equivalently, r\u0303E ) for parallax events, comparing\nthem to the distributions for all events. One important question is\nhow well do our simulations match the observed characteristics of\nparallax events. Although the overall fractions of parallax events\nseem consistent with current catalogues, we can also tentatively\ncompare the parallax parameters such as the projected Einstein radius, r\u0303E . In Fig. 13, we show a plot comparing the predictions from\n4\n\nHowever, recent work by Sumi et al. (2005) has suggested that even this\nassumption may not be wholly reliable.\n\n\f14\n\nSmith et al.\ntailed comparison between theoretical predictions and observations\nfor parallax events.\nUnique lens mass determinations for parallax events may become routine in the near future by combining a reliable measurement of r\u0303E with additional constraints, such as has been shown already for a number of events (An et al. 2002; Gould et al. 2004;\nKubas et al. 2005). One particular approach that has been proposed is the measurement of the separation between the two microlensed images using powerful interferometers such as VLTI\n(Delplancke, G\u00f3rski & Richichi 2001). We can see from our simulations that\nq such image separations at maximum magnification\n\n(\u03b8sep = \u03b8E u20 + 4, where u0 is the impact parameter corresponding\nto the maximum magnification) are larger for our parallax sample,\nwith mean separations of 1.8 mas compared to 0.8 mas for the full\nsample. Therefore it will be easier to resolve the two microlensed\nimages for parallax events and, in addition, their longer duration\nwill make it more feasible to plan high signal-to-noise ratio observations while the events are still undergoing high magnification.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nFigure 13. A comparison between the distribution of the projected Einstein\nradius (r\u0303E ) for observed parallax events and our mock catalogues. The distributions from our mock catalogue are given by the solid lines and the observed distributions are given by the data points (where Poisson errors have\nbeen assumed). The lower panel shows the observed distribution, while the\nmiddle panel shows the underlying distribution, after correcting for the efficiency (top panel).\n\nour simulations with the distribution of r\u0303E for the observed parallax events from Table 1. It should be noted that since the events\nfrom Table 1 come from a wide range of microlensing experiments\nwith differing durations, sampling and photometric properties, any\ncomparison can only be very speculative. However, as can be seen\nfrom the bottom panel of this figure, the observed distribution of\nr\u0303E (as given by the data points) appears to be in reasonable agreement with the distribution from parallax events in our mock catalogues. Furthermore, from our simulations, we can calculate the\nefficiency of recovering parallax signatures and attempt to determine the form of the underlying r\u0303E distribution for these observed\nevents. This method is analogous to the one used to convert an observed time-scale distribution into a true underlying time-scale distribution using the 'detection efficiency'. The upper panel of Fig.\n13 shows the efficiency of detecting parallax signatures, and when\napplied to the observed r\u0303E distribution we obtain the underlying\ndistribution shown in the middle panel. It appears that the observed\ndistribution is consistent with the underlying r\u0303E distribution from\nour simulations.\nAlthough there are currently too few observed parallax events\nfor us to make any firm statements about the distribution of the\nparallax parameters, it may become possible in the near future for\nprojects such as OGLE-III (Udalski 2003), which is currently detecting \u223c500 microlensing events each year. Assuming the rate of\nparallax detection for this project is similar to that of OGLE-II, the\nthree-fold increase in sky coverage means that a few good quality parallax events will be detected each year. It is expected that\nthe OGLE-III project (or an upgraded experiment, OGLE-IV) will\ncontinue for many years, which should be sufficient to enable the\nconstruction of distributions of r\u0303E and \u1e7d that are reasonably wellconstrained.
