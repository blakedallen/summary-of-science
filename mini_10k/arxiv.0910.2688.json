Introduction\nIn recent years many surprising results were discovered in the S-matrix of maximal supersymmetric theories in 4 dimensions. These include new symmetries and structures [1], representations [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] of tree-level amplitudes, and unexpected UV behaviour in loop perturbation theory [8, 9, 10, 11]. Many of these advancements rely heavily on newly developed\non-shell methods such as recursion relations to construct tree amplitudes, and generalized\nunitarity to obtain loop corrections by simply sewing tree amplitudes. More precisely, one\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\fcan now use either the CSW method [3], which constructs general amplitudes from MHV\nvertices, or the BCFW [4] construction, which expresses an n-point amplitude as direct products of lower point amplitudes, to efficiently construct tree amplitudes for either gauge or\ngravity theory. Modern unitarity methods [12] then allow one to construct loop amplitudes\nby expressing them in terms of a set of integrals that reproduces the cuts of the amplitude.\nTree amplitudes are then used to construct the coefficients of these integrals.\nThe major unsatisfactory aspects in these current approaches is their reliance on 4 dimensional spinor-helicity formalism [13, 14], while many interesting questions are inherently\nD dimensional. For example in the study of divergences in maximal supersymmetric theories, one usually encounters various bounds (at given loop level) on the dimension at which\nthe first potential divergence should appear [8, 15]. To study this bound one is required to\ncompute the divergences of the D dimensional theory. On the other hand even in QCD one\nloop amplitudes, D dimensional tree amplitudes are useful for obtaining rational terms when\nusing unitarity methods [16]. Therefore a spinor helicity formalism similar to 4 dimensions\nwill be helpful for these purposes.\nSince physical degrees of freedom are completely determined by its super Poincar\u00e9 quantum numbers, the power of spinor helicity formalism is then to represent these quantum\nnumbers covariantly using unconstrained variables. There has been recent progress in constructing general D6=4 spinor helicity formalism [17] and for D=10 [18], though the variables\nare constrained. Here we focus on 6 dimensions where the spinor-helicity formalism is very\nsimilar to 4 dimensions, as recently demonstrated by Cheung and O'Connell [19]. The idea is\nto start in 6 dimensions where the Lorentz group SO(5,1) has the covering group SU\u2217 (4). The\nvector forms an antisymmetric representation of SU\u2217 (4), and the on-shell condition is natu\u0227\nrally solved by introducing SU\u2217 (4) spinors, P AB = \u03bbAa \u03bbB\na , PAB = \u03bb\u0303A\u0227 \u03bb\u0303B . The indices a, \u0227\ntransform under the 6 dimensions little group SO(4)\u2243SU(2)\u00d7 SU(2). In fact, these spinors\ncan be viewed as (half)part of the spinor representation of the six dimensional conformal\ngroup SO\u2217 (8), i.e. they are twistors[20]. In this light, their property of being solutions to the\nmassless constraint follows directly from twistors being solutions to conformal constraints.\nIn this paper we will introduce Grassmann variables along with the spinors to form an\non-shell superspace. As we will demonstrate, the Yang-Mills field strength is in the ( 21 , 12 )\nrepresentation of the little group. Since for maximal N=(1,1) theory the full multiplet should\nbe contained in a single superfield, the non-chiral nature of the field strength then implies\na non-chiral on-shell superspace. These Grassmann variables are the fermionic pieces of the\nspinor representation(supertwistors) of the six dimensional superconformal group OSp\u2217 (8|2N).\nSince the supertwistors are self-conjugate, we covariantly truncate these variables using the\nSU(2)\u00d7SU(2) R indices. Compared to 4 dimensions whose twistor is not self-conjugate, one\nsimply takes the chiral twistor at the loss of manifest parity symmetry, here it is replaced by\nthe loss of R symmetry. Being non-chiral has the advantage of representing the amplitudes\nin a more symmetric fashion, instead of viewing the amplitudes from the MHV (or MHV)\npoint of view.1\n1\n\nMore precisely, from the view point of self dual (or anti-self dual) super Yang-Mills, which is naturally\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\fThis unification of MHV and MHV amplitudes in this superspace hints at 4 dimensional\noff-shell superspace which must be non-chiral. In fact the splitting of R-indices, when reduced\nto 4 dimensions, is similar to the 4 dimension projective superspace described in [22]. We will\nsee that our 4-point amplitude using 6 dimensions spinors shares the same form with that\nrecently derived in 4 dimensions projective superspace [23]. The fact that one may understand\n4 dimensions off-shell superspace from 6 dimensions on-shell is similar to the usual story of\nviewing the conformal group SO(2,4) as the Lorentz group in 6 dimensions acting on the\nprojective (modding out the scale) light-cone (p2 = 0). The theory on the light-cone is four\ndimensional and off-shell.\nWe begin with a discussion of 6 dimensional spinors similar to Cheung and O'Connell. In\nsection 3 we introduce Grassmann variables in the spirit of Ferber [14] and construct the N=2\nsuperspace. In section 4 we obtain the super amplitudes by simply supersymmetrizing the 3,\n4 and 5-point amplitudes derived in [19]. In section 5 we rederive the previous result using\nBCFW. Finally we show the application of this approach to loop amplitudes by reproducing\nthe one-loop four-point structure of maximal SYM in D dimensions [24].\n\n2. 6 dimensional on-shell spinors\nWe review the 6 dimensional spinor-helicity formalism recently developed by Cheung and\nO'Connell [19]. We will present it in parallel with the familiar 4 dimensional results. In 6\ndimensions Minkowski space the Lorentz group is SO(5,1) whose covering group is SU\u2217 (4).\nThe vector is in the anti-symmetric representation of SU\u2217 (4), and the scalar product of two\nvectors is defined as a contraction with the SU\u2217 (4) invariant tensor \u01ebABCD . For simplicity we\ndrop the \u2217 from now on. For a null vector one has\n6 D : p\u03bc = pAB , p2 = 0 \u2192 \u01ebABCD pAB pCD = 0 \u2192 pAB = \u03bbAa \u03bbB a ,\n\n(2.1)\n\n2\nwhere the spinors \u03bbA\na are pseudo real, A is the SU(4) index and a, \u0227 are the SU(2) indices.\nThe bi-spinor form of the momentum solves the on-shell constraint since there are no 4\ncomponent totally anti-symmetric tensors in SU(2). One can also represent the momentum\nin the anti-fundamental representation:\n\n1\npAB = \u01ebABCD pCD = \u03bb\u0303A\u1e03 \u03bb\u0303\u1e03B , \u03bbA\na \u03bb\u0303A\u0227 = 0.\n2\n\n(2.2)\n\nOne can also understand this solution by counting components. A null vector in 6 dimensions\nhas 5 components including a scale factor, meanwhile \u03bbAa has 4 \u00d7 2 = 8 components and the\nSU(2) invariance removes 3 of them. Since the definition of little group is the transformation\ngroup that leaves the null momentum invariant, the SU(2) indices on the spinors correspond\nto the 6 dimensions little group SO(4), whose covering group is SU(2)\u00d7SU(2).\nexpressed in terms of chiral superspace [21].\n2\nOne can work in other signatures, in the Wick rotated SO(3,3) the covering group would be SL(4), a, \u0227\ntransform under SL(2) and the spinors are real.\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n\fThis is similar to 4 dimensions on-shell momentum which has 3 components. We write\nthe 4 dimensional real momentum in terms of spinors\n4 D : p\u03b1\u03b1\u0307 = \u03bb\u03b1 \u03bb\u0303\u03b1\u0307 .\n\n(2.3)\n\nWith \u03bb\u03b1 being complex and \u03bb\u0303\u03b1\u0307 = \u00b1\u03bb\u0304\u03b1\u0307 in Minkowski space, one also has 4\u22121 = 3 components,\nwhere the 1 is from the invariance of p\u03b1\u03b1\u0307 under U(1) rotation \u03bb\u03b1 \u2192 ei\u03b8 \u03bb\u03b1 , \u03bb\u0303\u03b1\u0307 \u2192 e\u2212i\u03b8 \u03bb\u0303\u03b1\u0307 .\nNote that in arbitrary dimensions, one can always represent an on-shell momentum in\nbi-spinor form by first finding the solutions to the Dirac equation. These solutions can then\nbe used to construct the null momenta. However since the solution of the Dirac equation\nis non-covariant, this approach will be less useful for analytic analysis of the amplitudes.\nAn important distinction for the above (4)6 dimensional discussion, is that the spinors \"automatically\" satisfy the Dirac equation, they are unconstrained variables. This matching\nbetween massless degrees of freedom and the moding of the little group from the spinors\nonly exists in 3,4 and 6 dimensions. A demonstration of this difficulty can be seen in the\nrecent 10 dimensional twistor construction \u00e0 la Berkovits[18]. There the 10 dimensional null\nvector is constructed using a pure spinor \u03bb and a Weyl spinor \u03c0, p\u03bc = \u03bb\u03b3 \u03bc \u03c0. There is also a\ngauge invariance \u03b4\u03c0 = (\u03b3 \u03bc\u03bd \u03bb)\u03a9\u03bc\u03bd which gives the correct counting for an on-shell momentum,\n22+32-45=93 . However the gauge group is SO(10) which is larger than the little group SO(8),\nwhich results in residual gauge invariance in the components of the supertwistor field.\nThese 6 dimensional spinors are half of the 6 dimensional twistor. This twistor is in\nthe irreducible spinor representation of the 6 dimensional conformal group SO(6,2)=SO(8)*,\nan 8 dimensional chiral spinor which is composed of a 6 dimensional chiral and anti-chiral\nspinor[20]. The \u03bbAa and \u03bb\u0303A\u0227 are part of the chiral and anti-chiral twistor, which is equivalent representations due to triality, respectively. Since it is pseudoreal, the twistor and it's\nequivalent complex conjugate form a SU(2) doublet. This SU(2) then becomes the SU(2)\nlittle group for the 6 dimensional spinors. Even though in this paper we are interested in\nthe N=(1,1) theory which is non-conformal, it is still useful to analyse scattering amplitudes\nof non-conformal massless theories in twistor space. A well known example is the study of\nYang-Mills amplitudes using 4 dimensional twistors. Note that one anticipates this understanding of 6 dimensional spinor helicity in terms of twistors will play an important role for\nthe analysis of the (2,0) theory which is expected to be superconformal.\nLorentz invariants are constructed by contracting the SU(4) indices:\n\u01ebABCD (\u03bb\u03031 )A\u0227 (\u03bb\u03032 )B \u1e03 (\u03bb\u03033 )C \u010b (\u03bb\u03034 )Dd \u0307 = [1\u0227 2\u1e03 3\u010b 4d \u0307]\n\u01ebABCD (\u03bb1 )A a (\u03bb2 )B b (\u03bb3 )C c (\u03bb4 )D d = h1a 2b 3c 4d i,\n\n(\u03bbi )A\na (\u03bb\u0303j )A\u0227 = hia |j\u0227 ] \u2192 det(hia |j\u0227 ]) = \u22122pi * pj\n\nBC\nh\u03bba |6p1 6p2 6p3 |\u03bbb i = \u03bbA\n(p3 )CD \u03bbD\na (p1 )AB (p2 )\nb\n\n[\u03bb\u0303\u0227 |6p1 6p2 6p3 6p4 |\u03bbb i = \u03bb\u0303A\u0227 (p1 )AB (p2 )BC (p3 )CD (p4 )DE \u03bbE\nb .\n3\n\nThere are 22 degrees of freedom for a pure spinor.\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n\fNote that a chiral and an anti-chiral spinor can only be contracted with an even number\nof momenta. These spinors can be expressed in terms of momenta in a non-covariant way.\nFurthermore, when the momenta are restricted to a 4 dimensions subspace, all of the above\nLorentz invariants can be rewritten in terms of 4 dimensional spinors.

Note that the\nchiral N=(1,0) super Yang-Mills and the mysterious N=(2,0) theory use chiral on-shell superspaces; however the former is not maximal5 and the later does not contain a vector gauge\nfield.\nRecent constructions of the S-matrix for maximal gauge and gravity theories make use\nof 4 dimensional supertwistor space. Here we construct the 6 dimensional N=2 on-shell\nsuperspace in similar fashion, i.e. by introducing Grassmann variables \u03b7aI 6 , where I is the R\nindex and a is the little group index, one can arrive at the usual superspace by contracting\nthe little group indices with the spinors. In 4 dimensions I = 1, 2, 3, 4 and the little group\nis U(1), under which the Grassmann variables transform as \u03b7 I \u2192 e\u2212i\u03b8 \u03b7 I , \u03b7\u0304I \u2192 ei\u03b8 \u03b7\u0304I . The\nrelation to the usual superspace can be seen with the help of the spinors\n4 D : \u03b8 I\u03b1 = \u03bb\u03b1 \u03b7 I , \u03b8\u0304J \u03b1\u0307 = \u03bb\u0303\u03b1\u0307 \u03b7\u0304J .\nNote that in a sense one contracts with respect to the little group.\nOne can do similar for 6 dimensions. Maximal super Yang-Mills in 6 dimensions has\nN=(1,1) supersymmetry with R-symmetry group USp(2)\u00d7USp(2)=SU(2)\u00d7SU(2). We introduce \u03b7 aI and \u03b7\u0303\u0227I \u2032 where the I, I \u2032 are the SU(2)R symmetry indices. Note that \u03b7 and \u03b7\u0303 are\ncomplex and independent. They are the fermionic part of the chiral and anti-chiral supertwistor; the spinor representation of OSp\u2217 (8|2). The full 6 dimension superspace variables\nare then\n\u0227\naI\n6 D : q AI = \u03bbA\na \u03b7 , q\u0303AI \u2032 = \u03bb\u0303A\u0227 \u03b7\u0303I \u2032 .\nIn 4 dimensions maximal super Yang-Mills (as well as gravity), one can express the full\namplitude using either chiral or anti-chiral superspace, i.e. only half of the full superspace,\nsince this is enough to contain all physical degrees of freedom. This is due to the self-CPT\nconjugate nature of the physical spectrum. In 6 dimensions we have similar result. However\nsince the supertwistors are self-conjugate, only half of the degrees of freedoms for \u03b7 aI and\n5\n\nFor non-maximal theories, the on-shell states cannot be contained in a single on-shell superfield.\nThese \u03b7 variables appear in a similar fashion as with the 4 dimensional N=4 theory. We refer to [25] for\na detailed discussion of its properties.\n6\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n\f+\n\n\u2212\n\nA\n\nA\n\nFigure 1: The weight space diagram for 4D N=4 super Yang-Mills\n\n\u03b7\u0303\u0227I \u2032 are independent. Therefore to construct our on-shell superspace we need to truncate the\n\u03b7, \u03b7\u0303s. Since we wish to use the little group index to label our states, we will truncate using\nthe R-indices.\nNote that this situation is equivalent to the issue of trying to construct off-shell N> 1\nsuperspace, where chiral constraints usually lead to field equations. One of the well known\nexamples is the N=2 harmonic superspace [26] in 4 dimensions. Here one introduces harmonic\nvariables u\u00b1\nI to parameterize the SU(2)/U(1) coset. These variables are then used to separate\n+\n+I\nI\nthe \u03b8 variables into two separate sets (\u03b8\u03b1+ = u+\nI \u03b8\u03b1 , \u03b8\u0304\u03b1\u0307 = u \u03b8\u0304I \u03b1\u0307 ) and + \u2192 \u2212. Then the prepotential, which contains the physical gauge field, depends only on a subspace (the \"analytic\nsuperspace\") which only includes \u03b8 + , \u03b8\u0304 + . The harmonic variables can be viewed as providing\na linear combination of the R-symmetry index, and therefore separating the supercharges into\nsubsets.7\nTherefore we can use the two harmonics coming from our SU(2)\u00d7SU(2) R symmetry to\nAI +\nconstruct our half superspace, i.e. we choose our subspace to include only q A+ = u+\nI q , q\u0303A =\n\u2032\nA , D\u0303 B } = {D\nB\n\u0169+I q\u0303AI \u2032 . This is a consistent truncation if {DA\u2212 , DB\u2212 } = {D\u0303\u2212\nA\u2212 , D\u0303\u2212 } = 0 so\n\u2212\nA \u03c6 = 0. This is true since\nthat one can consistently impose DA\u2212 \u03c6 = D\u0303\u2212\n{DAI , DBJ } = CIJ \u2202AB , {D\u0303IA\u2032 , D\u0303JB\u2032 } = CI \u2032 J \u2032 \u2202 AB ,\nwhere CIJ is antisymmetric. Thus we will construct the on-shell superamplitude as a function\n+\nor equivalently \u03b7a+ , \u03b7\u0303\u0227+\nof only q A+ , q\u0303A\nM = M (p, \u03b7a+ , \u03b7\u0303\u0227+ ).\nFrom now on we drop the + for simplicity.8\nThe group theoretical interpretation of the \u03b7s is that they are the raising and lowering\ngenerators defined on the weight space of the little group [17]. For example, in 4-dimensions\nthe physical states can be conveniently written as states in the weight space of the U(1) little\ngroup fig.(1). A self-CPT spectrum then means that one has enough susy, and therefore\nenough \u03b7s, to reach all the physical states. Note that the lowering generators, represented by\n\u03b7\u0304s, are absent. The fact that we began with A\u2212 reflects the fact that the on-shell superspace\nis a chiral superspace. In 6-dimensions the states now lie in the weight space of SU(2)\u00d7SU(2),\nfig.(2). Using the 4 \u03b7a , \u03b7\u0303\u0227 s, one can begin with the scalar and reach all the other physical\n7\n\nOf course these new bosonic R-coordinates also provide the infinite auxiliary fields that are necessary to\nclose the susy algebra off-shell. Different choices (or a subset) of these coordinates represent different off-shell\nformulations, for example there is also the N=2 projective superspace [27].\n8\nR-symmetry is not really manifest since we do not integrate over the harmonics.\n\n\u20137\u2013\n\n\fA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nA\n\nFigure 2: The weight space diagram for 6D N=2 super Yang-Mills.

For our purpose the precise nature of the\nSU (2)\n(2)\nharmonics u and \u0169 which paremeterize the double coset SU\nU (1) \u00d7 U (1) , is irrelevant for onshell amplitudes. However, this R-coset space appears to be very similar to the projective\nsuperspace recently proposed for N=4 super Yang-Mills[23], this superspace is based on the\nOSp(4|4)\nsupercoset OSp(2|2)\n2 . If one uses the covering group, then the R-space part becomes\nSO(4)\nSU (2) SU (2)\n\u2192\n\u00d7\n.\nSO(2)2\nU (1)\nU (1)\nAs we will see in the next section, the 4-point tree amplitude written in 6 dimensions has the\nsame form as the 4-point amplitude derived in [23], in which the R-space parameters were\nevaluated at 0 anyway. The fact that the 6-dimensional on-shell amplitude shares the same\n\n\u20138\u2013\n\n\fform as the 4 dimensional off-shell is not surprising since on-shell in 6 dimensions simply\nrestricts to the 6 dimensional lightcone. Projecting out the scale (projective light-cone) one\nhas a 4 dimensional space where the vectors are not constrained to be null. The fact that one\ncan extrapolate the 4 dimensional amplitude from a higher dimension on-shell counterpart is\nof great convenience. Recent advances in the evaluation of the S-matrix, which are usually\nonly valid on-shell9 , can then be used to analyse 4 dimensional off-shell amplitudes which may\ngive implications to an off-shell action, which is still lacking. Another application would be\nto use these off-shell amplitudes as an alternative to the recently proposed IR regularization\nscheme for N=4 super Yang-Mills [28].\n\n4. Amplitudes in superspace\n4.1 4-point amplitude\nWe begin with the 4-point amplitude since the supersymmetrization is relatively straightforward.

Again this is because the field strengths in 4 dimensions are (anti)chiral.\nFrom (4.1) one can deduce the supersymmetric form:\nP\nP\n\u03b44 ( q)\u03b44 ( q\u0303)\n6 D susy : M4 = \u2212i\n,\n(4.3)\nst\nwhere i, j, ** of the integration measure can be any of the external legs.

The Yang-Mills amplitude corresponds to choosing 4i=1 d\u03b7ia d\u03b7\u0303i\u0227\n9\n\nFor example the use of BCFW relies on the fact that the complex deformation only produces simple poles.\nIf one looks at the off-shell amplitude, the shift will in general produce double poles. This will lead to residues\nthat do not factorize into two tree amplitudes as the usual BCFW.\n\n\u20139\u2013\n\n\fas the integration measure.

Since our aim is to use BCFW as a systematic way of generating\nhigher point amplitudes, we will proceed to compute it with complex momenta. Amplitudes\nshould be written in terms of Lorentz invariants, however for the 3-point amplitude one has\nP\nthe problem of vanishing Lorentz invariants due to kinematic constraints: p2i = 0, 3i=1 pi =\n0 \u2192 (pi * pj ) = 0. In 4 dimensions this is solved by using complex momenta or going to split\nsignature with real momenta, then \u03bb and \u03bb\u0303 are no longer related and one can set either hiji\nor [ij] to zero but not both. In 6 dimensions one has\n\u0227\npi * pj = 0 \u2192 (\u03bbi )Aa (\u03bbi )B\na (\u03bb\u0304j )A\u0227 (\u03bb\u0304j )B = dethia |j\u0227 ] = 0.\n\ni.e.the 2\u00d72 matrix h1a |2\u0227 ] has rank 1. Therefore Cheung and O'Connell solved this by introducing SU(2) spinor variables for these bi-spinor matrices hi|j]a\u0227 = uia \u0169j \u0227 .10 To define\ntheir inverse, due to their presence in the denominator for the polarization vectors (2.5), one\nintroduces variables wja defined by ua wb \u2212 ub wa = Cab . This definition defines wja up to a\nshift wja \u2192 wja + bj uja . This ambiguity can be partially removed by requiring\na A\na A\nw1a \u03bbA\n1a + w2 \u03bb2a + w3 \u03bb3a = 0.\n\nThen wia are defined up to shifts with b1 + b2 + b3 = 0. Even though there is still ambiguity,\nthis will help us determine the full amplitude by requiring invariance under this shift.\nThe 3-pt Yang-Mills amplitude is given as\n6 D M3 = i\u0393abc \u0393\u0303\u0227\u1e03\u010b = i(u1 u2 w3 + u1 w2 u3 + w1 u2 u3 )abc (\u01691 \u01692 w\u03033 + \u01691 w\u03032 \u01693 + w\u03031 \u01692 \u01693 )\u0227\u1e03\u010b .\n10\n\nWe give their definitions and properties in appendix (B)\n\n\u2013 10 \u2013\n\n\fTo motivate the structure of the corresponding super amplitude, we cast the 3 point\namplitude into the BCFW construction. Through BCFW, the 4-point amplitude can be\nconstructed by sewing two 3-point amplitudes and integrating away 4 \u03b7s that carry the\nhelicities of the propagator. Since the resulting 4-point amplitude has 8 fermionic delta\nfunctions, this requires the 3-point amplitudes to carry a total of 12 delta functions. Indeed\nin 4 dimensions, one is required to sew an MHV and an MHV amplitude. Since MHV has\n8 delta functions in the anti-chiral \u03b7\u0304, one Fourier transforms it into \u03b7s and results in a form\nthat has only 4 delta functions, a total of 12. As discussed previously, in 6 dimensions there\nis no difference between MHV and MHV, while the number of \u03b7s to integrate remains the\nsame. This leads to the conclusion that the 6 dimensions 3-point amplitude should be given\nwith 6 delta functions and one has the following result:\n\n6 D susy : M3 =\n\ni2 X\nX\nih X A X\n\u03b4(\nq )\u03b4(\nq\u0303A ) \u03b4(\nwb \u03b7b )\u03b4(\nw\u0303\u1e03 \u03b7\u0303\u1e03 ).\n2\n\n(4.7)\n\nTo confirm this is true choose a specific piece of the integration measure, integrating \u03b71a \u03b72b \u03b73c \u03b7\u03031\u0227\n\u03b7\u03032\u1e03 \u03b7\u03033\u010b .

Similarly if one integrates \u03b72a \u03b72b \u03b71c \u03b7\u03031\u0227 \u03b7\u03032\u1e03 \u03b7\u03033\u010b this\ngives\niu1c (\u01691\u0227 \u01692\u1e03 w\u03033\u010b + \u01691\u0227 w\u03032\u1e03 \u01693\u010b + w\u03031\u0227 \u01692\u1e03 \u01693\u010b ).\nThis is the amplitude for two gauginos and one gauge boson (g1 , \u03bb\u03032 , \u03bb\u03033 ).

BCFW construction\nHere we give a short introduction to the BCFW construction and show how to obtain our\n4-point result from the 3-point. We begin by shifting the momenta of two arbitrary external\nlines, say 1 and 2, by a vector q:\np\u03021 = p1 + zq, p\u03022 = p2 \u2212 zq.\nWe require the vector q to satisfy\nq 2 = q * p1 = q * p2 = 0,\nso that the deformed momenta remain on-shell, p\u030221 = p\u030222 = 0. This can be done by choosing\nq to be related to the polarization of line 1, q \u223c \u01eb1 , and choosing \u03bb2 as the reference spinor\n\u03bc. However the polarization vector has additional little group index. One remedies this by\ncontracting it with an auxiliary parameter xa\u0227 [19]\nq AB = xa\u0227\n\n[A 1 ih2 B]\na\nc\nh2c |1\u0227 ]\n\n.\n\nThen the requirement of q 2 = 0 implies det xa\u0227 = 0, i.e, xa\u0227 = xa x\u0303\u0227 . Since the amplitude is a\nrational function of momentum, this deformation will result in a complex function with only\nsimple poles. The poles are the propagators in the denominator and are simple since\n2\nP\u03021j\n\n2\n\n= (p\u03021 + * * *pj ) =\n\n2\nP1j\n\n+ z2q * P1j \u2192 z1j\n\n2\nP1j\n=\u2212\n,\n2q * P1j\n\nwhere P1j represents the sum of momentum on one side of the propagator. Note that if the\nshifted lines are either not included or both included, one will not develop a pole and the\ncorresponding graphs do not contribute.\nIf the complex amplitude vanishes as z \u2192 \u221e, then it is uniquely determined by it's\nresidues:\nX c1j\n.\nA(z) =\nz \u2212 z1j\nj\n\n\u2013 12 \u2013\n\n\fP c\n. The sum is understood as sumOur physical amplitude then corresponds to A(0) = \u2212 j z1j\n1j\nming different ways of separating the amplitude in two halves with the propagator producing\nthe pole. The residues c1j take the form\nc1j = \u2212\u00c2L \u00d7 \u00c2R\n\n1\n2q * P1j\n\nP2\n\n1j\nz= 2q*P\n\n,\n\n(5.1)\n\n1j\n\nand therefore\nA(0) =\n\nX\nj\n\n\u00c2L (p\u03021 , * * *, pj , \u2212P\u03021j )\n\ni\n2 \u00c2R (P\u03021j , **, p\u03022 )\nP1j\n\nP2\n\n1j\nz= 2q*P\n\n.\n\n1j\n\nSince both p\u03021 , p\u03022 are on-shell and P\u03021j is also on-shell when the shift is evaluated at the\npole, each function on either side of the propagator becomes itself an on-shell amplitude of\nlower points. Thus BCFW expresses an n point amplitude in terms of lower point on-shell\namplitudes with two of their external momenta deformed.\nAn important ingredient is the fact that A(z) vanishes as z \u2192 \u221e, this is true for maximal\nsupersymmetric theories in 4 dimensions and general pure gauge and gravity theories [25, 29].\nSince the 3 and 4-point amplitudes have only delta functions in the numerator, if one shifts in a\nway that preserves the (super)momentum conservation relation, the amplitudes automatically\nvanishes at large z. Indeed we define our super symmetric shifts to satisfy these conditions as\nwe show in appendix (C). For higher point amplitudes the numerator will have, besides the\n(super)momentum conservation delta functions, individual 6pi s and qi s. The reason why one\nmight produce more zs in the numerator than the purely Yang-Mills case, is the integration of\n\u03b712 or \u03b722 which correspond to non-vector reference lines. From the form of the shifted q1\u0302 , q2\u0302 in\n(C.3), one can see that integrating \u03b712 or \u03b722 will not produce z 2 terms. Therefore non-vector\nreference lines will only produce shifts in qi s that are at most linear in z, which is the same\ndegree as purely Yang-Mills. Thus we conclude that in principle the supersymmetric theory\nshould vanish at large z if the Yang-Mills theory vanishes. Note that our argument is similar\nto the on-shell supersymmetric Ward identity used in [25].\n5.1 BCFW for 4-point\nNow let us compute the 4-point amplitude. Choosing 1 and 2 as the shifted leg, the only\ngraph that will be contributing will be the t channel graph fig.(3)\nThen the BCFW for super Yang-Mills is written as\n#2\n\u0015\" X\n\u0014 Z\n\u0015\u0014 Z\nZ\nZ\nX\nX\nX\n1\n\u22121 1\nq A )\u03b4(\nq\u0303A ) [\u03b4(\nwnb \u03b7nb )\u03b4(\nw\u0303n\u1e03 \u03b7\u0303n\u1e03 )]\nd\u03b7Pa\nd\u03b7P a d\u03b7\u0303P \u0227 \u03b4(\nd\u03b7\u0303P\u0227\n4 2\n2\nL\nL\nL\nL\n\"\n#2\nX\nX\nX\nX\ni\nq B )\u03b4(\nq\u0303B ) [\u03b4(\nwnc \u03b7nc )\u03b4(\nw\u0303n\u010b \u03b7\u0303n\u010b )],\n\u00d7 \u03b4(\nt\nR\n\nR\n\nR\n\nR\n\n\u2013 13 \u2013\n\n\fP\n\nK\n\nFigure 3: The 4-point amplitude in the BCFW formalism.

The last two way give vanishing results since they produce terms proportional\nto a \u03bbA\nP .

Now there are two graphs contributing if\none chooses 1 and 2 as the shifted legs.\n\n5.2 BCFW for 5-point\nThere are two contributions to the 5-point amplitude as shown in fig.(4). Now the crucial\npoint is that the auxiliary parameter x, x\u0303 introduced by the shift should cancel out in the end.\nThis should be automatic since the xs enter the BCFW with zs, good large z behaviour then\nautomatically ensures they drop out in the end. Explicitly showing this will produce a final\nresult that is in a compact form. In the Yang-Mills computation, these parameters cancel\nafter combining the two graphs D1 , D2 . In principle the BCFW for super amplitude should\nbe parallel to the Yang-Mills calculation, since the only difference is the integrating of the \u03b7P s\nthat carry the degrees of freedom in the propagator. Here we will follow suit and compute\nthe two graphs separately, after performing the integration we will show that the result has\nthe same form as Yang-Mills and therefore the cancellation goes through accordingly and one\ncan read off the supersymmetric result straight forwardly.\nD1 :\nWe compute\ni\n1\nD1 =\n2 s51 \u015d23 s34\n=\n\nZ\n\n\"\n#2\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nw\u03b7)\u03b4(\nw\u0303\u03b7\u0303)\nd4 \u03b7P \u03b44 (\nq A )\u03b44 (\nq\u0303A ) \u03b4(\nq B )\u03b4(\nq\u0303B ) \u03b4(\nR\n\nR\n\nX\nX\n1\ni\n(q * p5 )\u03b44 (\nq A )\u03b44 (\nq\u0303A )\n2 s51 \u03c6s34\nf ull\n\nf ull\n\nZ\n\nL\n\n\"\n\nL\n\nL\n\n#2\n\nX\nX\nq B )\u03b4(\nq\u0303B )\nd4 \u03b7P \u03b4(\nL\n\nL\n\nL\n\nX\nX\n\u03b4(\nw\u03b7)\u03b4(\nw\u0303\u03b7\u0303),\nL\n\nL\n\nwhere\n\u015d23 = 2p\u03022 * p3 =\n\n\u03c6\n, \u03c6 = s23 q * p5 + s51 q * p3 .\nq * p5\n\n(5.3)\n\ns51 s12\ns51\n= \u2212 [x\u0303|p\nfor this graph.\nWe've used that z is evaluated at the pole z = \u2212 2q*p\n5\n5 p2 |xi\n\nNow we do the \u03b7p integral.

Conclusion\nIn this paper we present an on-shell superspace for maximal supersymmetric on-shell amplitudes in 6 dimensions. Combined with unitarity methods, one can efficiently study quantum\ncorrections for 6D gauge and gravity theories. For example, this has potential application for\nstudying the UV divergences of maximal supergravity at 4 loop where the critical dimension\nfor finiteness is 5.5 [8]. This can also be used to study the N=4 theory near D=4 in the context of AdS/CFT. For non supersymmetric theories, one can also use these 6 dimensions tree\namplitudes for constructing loop amplitudes using unitarity methods. The particles across\nthe cuts are 6 dimensions and therefore may produce non-vanishing rational terms that were\nundetected using 4 dimensions tree amplitudes. One then sets the external lines to be in the\n4 dimensions subspace in the end. The 6 dimensional spinors constructed here should also be\nuseful in representing the S-matrix for the N=(2,0) theory.\nThe other important feature is its close relation to 4 dimensions N=4 off-shell superspace.\nBeing off-shell in 4 dimensions, this should provide a more suitable space to study the recently\ndiscovered dual superconformal symmetry[1], which is broken by IR singularities.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank Donal O'Connell and Clifford Cheung for detailed discussions of\ntheir six dimensional Yang-Mills calculation and John Joseph M.

For this purpose, it is convenient to have a dictionary\nfrom which our 6 dimensional Lorentz invariants, written in terms of spinors variables, can\nbe rewritten in terms of 6 dimensional momenta.\nSince a 6 dimensional vector is in the anti-symmetric representation of SU(4), the offdiagonal block of this 4\u00d74 matrix is then 4 dimensional.

If one constructs higher-point\namplitude through BCFW construction, sometimes it might be preferable not to factorize out\nall the shifted variables. This would then leave behind SU(2) spinors wa , w\u0303\u0227 . We properly\ndefine these SU(2) spinors in appendix (B), so their dependence on momentum can be easily\nderived from the above spinors.\n\nA.2 6 dimensional spinors in terms of 4 dimensions\nSuppose all external momenta lie in a 4 dimensions subspace, one should then be able to\nextract the 4 dimensional amplitude from our 6 dimensional result.

Therefore when the external momenta lie in a\n4 dimensional subspace, the connection between 6 dimensions and 4 dimensions little group\nis now clear: the usual 4 dimensions U(1) helicity group lies in the diagonal subgroup of the 6\ndimensions SU(2)\u00d7SU(2). One can now relabel the SU(2) indices a, \u0227 as \u00b1 which represents\n\u00b1 12 under the U(1) helicity group, i.e. \u03b7a \u2192 \u03b7\u00b1 , \u03b7\u0303\u0227 \u2192 \u03b7\u0303\u00b1 .\nAnother way of viewing this is through the supersymmetric theory.

In the original Yang-Mills\ncalculation, the idea is that even though the shift is defined using the polarization vector\nof the the 1st leg, the result should not depend on its polarization state[19]. xa and x\u0303\u0227\nare arbitrary parameters that parameterize this ambiguity, and the statement that the final\nresult is independent of the polarization state translates into independence of xa , x\u0303\u0227 . In the\nsupersymmetric case, the first leg may not be a vector. However one still uses the spinors\nof the first leg to construct polarization vector, which carries an SU(2) little group index.\nAgain the final result should not depend on its state, thus one contracts the SU(2) index of\nthe first spinor to parameterize this dependence, and in the end the final result should again\nbe independent of it.\n\nD. 5-point\nHere we give some details on the derivation of (5.6) and (5.8):\ni\u0002\n\u0003\ni\nxa x\u0227 h\n\u2212\nu1\u0302a h2b |1\u0302\u0227 ](\u01691\u0302 * \u03b7\u03031\u0302 \u2212 \u01695 * \u03b7\u03035 ) \u0169\u010b5 h2b |5\u010b ](u1\u0302 * \u03b71\u0302 \u2212 u5 * \u03b75 )\ns51 \u03c6s34 s12\ni\nih\nixa x\u0227 h\n \u0307\n=\u2212\nu1\u0302a h2b |1\u0302\u0227 ]\u01691\u0302 * \u03b7\u03031\u0302 \u2212 h2b |1\u0302\u0227 ]h1\u0302a |5d \u0307]\u03b7\u03035d h2b |5\u010b ]h1\u0302d |5\u010b ]\u03b71\u0302d \u2212 \u0169\u010b5 h2b |5\u010b ]u5 * \u03b75\ns51 \u03c6s34 s12\n(D.1)\nNow we need to get rid of u1\u0302 \u01691\u0302 .
