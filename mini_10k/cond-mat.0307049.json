We argue that at low temperatures\nthe true electric field in the bulk can be approximated by a modified Josephson relation\nE = (vS \u2212 vL ) \u00d7 BV , where vS is the condensate velocity.\nKeywords: superconductors; electric field; vortex dynamics.\n\n1. Introduction\nFor type II superconductors with moving vortices Josephson1 derived the formula\nE\u2032 \u2261 \u2212\u2207(\u03c6 + \u03bc/e) \u2212 \u2202A/\u2202t = \u2212vL \u00d7 BV .\n\n(1)\n\nThe effective electric field E\u2032 is a gauge-invariant generalization of the gradient of\nthe electrochemical potential \u03c6 + \u03bc/e, with \u03bc being the local chemical potential,a\nvL is the velocity of the vortex lattice and BV = nV \u03c60 is the averaged magnetic\nfield generated by vortices distributed with the density nV .\nThe Josephson relation (1) proved to be useful in situations when one evaluates\nthe difference between electrochemical potentials as measured by Ohmic contacts.\nOn the other hand it is not explaining the voltage measured by a contactless capacitive pickup2,3 . It also cannot be used for interpretation of the FIR data,4 because electric field of the laser light has to be matched with the true electric field\nE = \u2212\u2207\u03c6 \u2212 \u2202A/\u2202t, not with its effective counterpart E\u2032 .\nVector potential is the linear and electrostatic potential is the quadratic function\nof the local condensate velocity5 , so in principle one can evaluate the electric field\ndirectly from its definition. Such approach would require a microscopic picture of\nthe moving Abrikosov vortex lattice what represents a demanding numerical task.\na Here\n\nwe are using the nowadays commonly used convention in which the so called electrochemical\npotential is identical with the Gibbs chemical potential \u03bcGibbs = \u03bc + e\u03c6. With a good approximation, the electrostatic potential \u03c6 represents the long-range interaction while the chemical potential\n\u03bc is a local functional of the density, temperature, BCS gap, and so on. Josephson in his original\npaper1 uses the term chemical potential for the Gibbs chemical potential.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nWe argue that at low temperatures, when the contribution of normal electrons can\nbe neglected, the true electric field can be approximated as\nE = (vS \u2212 vL ) \u00d7 BV ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere vS is the mean velocity of condensate obtained by averaging over the elementary cell of the Abrikosov vortex lattice.\n2. Electric field in type I superconductor\nIt was theoretically predicted5 and experimentally confirmed2,3 that superconducting current generates transversal electric field. In the planar geometry, this field can\nbe derived from the Newton equation mv\u0307S = eE + evS \u00d7 B. Since the acceleration\nis zero, one finds E = \u2212vS \u00d7 B. From the London condition \u2207 \u00d7 vS = \u2212eB/m\nsolved by mvS = \u2212eA one can derive a more general formula e\u03c6 = \u2212 12 mvS2 , which\napplies also for curved streamlines with nonzero centripetal acceleration and for\ntime dependent vector potentials. Electric field is acting also on the crystal lattice\nand by this way the Lorentz force is mediated to it.\nAt finite temperatures the presence of quasiparticles must be also taken into\naccount. When flowing, normal electrons dissipate energy and therefore, in spite of\nthe presence of an electric field, the average velocity of the normal state fluid vN\nis zero at equilibrium. This is explained by the interaction between the superconducting and the normal state fluid, known as quasiparticle screening6 . Due to it the\nelectrostatic Bernoulli potential\nis reduced by the share of the condensate so that it\n\u0001\nreads e\u03c6 = \u2212nS /n 21 m\u2217 vS2 . Arguments explaining electric field in superconductors\ncan be found in the BCS theory7 and the extended Ginzburg-Landau theory8 , too.\nThe fact that electric field generated by surface currents mediate Lorentz force to\nthe crystal lattice follows from the Budd-Vannimenus (BV) theorem9 . For simplicity\nin the following we restrict ourselves to low temperatures, where interaction with\nquasiparticles can be neglected.\n3. Electric field in type II superconductor\nSuperconducting current acts on the vortices by the Magnus force, which (supposing\nthat vortices are aligned parallel to the z-axis) reads10\nFV\nM =\n\nnS h\n(vS \u2212 vL ) \u00d7 z.\n2\n\n(3)\n\nIt follows from the third Newton law that with the Magnus force acting on vortices also a reaction force felt by the superconducting particles FSM = \u2212 nnVS FV\nM =\n\u2212e (vS \u2212 vL ) \u00d7 BV must be introduced.\nIn steady state in which vortices and superconducting fluid move without acceleration, the total forces acting on them have to vanish. The superconducting particles\nfeel the effect of electric field, Lorentz force (interaction with external magnetic field\n\n\f3\n\nBext penetrating into the superconductor) and the reaction of Magnus force. From\nthe Newton equation of motion mv\u0307S = eE + evS \u00d7 Bext \u2212 e (vS \u2212 vL ) \u00d7 BV one gets\nE = \u2212vS \u00d7 Bext + (vS \u2212 vL ) \u00d7 BV .\n\n(4)\n\nIn the bulk, where external magnetic field is screened off, the electric field can be\napproximated by modified Josephson relation (2).\nFrom this it follows, that the true electric field is nonzero even if vortices are\npinned. It is understandable. The sum of Magnus forces acting on the individual\nvortices is equal to the Lorentz force, which the current feels in magnetic field\nBV created by the vortex lattice. Nevertheless, the Magnus force represents the\ninteraction of the superconducting fluid with vortices, and not an interaction with\nthe external magnetic field Bext . Pinned vortices can remain in the superconductor\neven if external magnetic field is switched off and in this case the total force acting\non the crystal lattice is zero. Vortices are not moving, as they are kept by the pinning\nforce. The reaction of the Magnus force felt by the superfluid is balanced by electric\nfield (2) and it also balances pinning force felt by the crystal lattice. If external\nmagnetic field is present, according to the BV theorem, electric field induced by the\nsurface currents mediates Lorentz force on the crystal lattice.\n4. Conclusion\nEffective electric field in type II superconductor is given by Josephson relation (1).\nAt low temperatures in steady state the true electric field in the bulk can be approximated by the modified Josephson relation (2). In the presence of transport\ncurrent, the Lorentz force acting on the superconducting wire in external magnetic\nfield is mediated by electric field generated by the surface currents.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by M\u0160MT program Kontakt ME 601 and GA\u010cR\n202000643, GAAV A1010312 grants.
