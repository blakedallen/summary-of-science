The problem addressed\nhere arises from a question of communication theory.\n\nKeywords: Projections - Lattices - Dense Packings.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIt was recently proved [3] that any n-dimensional lattice can be approximated by a sequence of lattices such that each element is, up to similarity,\nthe orthogonal projection of the cubic lattice Zn+1 onto a hyperplane determined by a linear equation with integer coefficients. Given a target\nlattice \u039b \u2282 Rn , it is possible to find a vector v \u2208 Zn+1 from the construction in [3], such that the distance between \u039b and a lattice which\nis equivalent to the projection of Zn+1 onto v \u22a5 has order O(1/ kvk1/n ),\nwhere kvk is the Euclidean norm of v. A natural question that arises\nfrom that result is whether it is possible to improve this convergence. We\ngive a positive answer to this question by showing a sufficient condition to\nobtain sequences converging to an integer lattice with order O(1/ kvk2/n ).\n1\n\n\fWe also show explicit constructions of such sequences for some families\nof lattices (Dn , odd n, Dn\u2217 ) and exhibit a table of which is, to our knowledge, the best sequences of projection lattices in the sense of the tradeoff\nbetween density and kvk.\nApart from the purely geometric interest, the problem of finding sequences of projection lattices with a better order of convergence is motivated by an application in joint source-channel coding of a Gaussian\nchannel [6]. In the aforementioned paper, the authors propose a coding\nscheme based on curves on flat tori and show that the efficiency of this\nscheme is closely related to the \"small-ball radius\" of these curves, which\ncan be approximated by the packing radius of a lattice obtained by projecting Zn+1 onto the subspace v \u22a5 for v \u2208 Zn+1 . Given a value l0 > 0, a\nworth objective to the design of good codes in the sense of [6] is the one\nof choosing a vector v \u2208 Zn+1 with kvk = l0 in such a way to maximize\nr(v) = min min kvt \u2212 nk ,\nn\u2208Zn+1 t\u2208R\n\n(1)\n\nwhich is the length of the shortest vector of \u039bv , the projection of Zn+1\nonto v \u22a5 . Let \u03b4\u039bv be the center density of these lattices (for undefined\nterms see Section II). Since the volume of \u039bv is given by 1/ kvk (see [4]),\nwe have:\nr(v)n kvk\n,\n(2)\n2n\ntherefore maximizing r(v) implies maximizing \u03b4\u039bv .\nAnother geometrical formulation to this problem is the so-called fat\nstrut problem. A \"strut\" is defined as a cylinder anchored at two points\nin Zn+1 such that its interior does not contain any other integer point.\nGiven l0 > 0, the fat strut problem asks for a vector v \u2208 Zn+1 of length l0\nthat maximizes the radius of the strut anchored at 0 and v. This problem\nis shown to be equivalent to the one of finding dense projections of Zn+1\n[4]. Therefore, projection lattices with higher densities imply fat-struts\nwith larger radii, and the problem addressed in this work is related to\nfinding small vectors that attain high density projection lattices. This is\ndone by considering families of projections of Zn+1 .\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we summarize some\n\u03b4\u039bv =\n\n2\n\n\frelevant concepts and results on lattices. In Section 3, we derive a sufficient condition to construct good sequences of projection lattices and in\nSection 4 we exhibit explicit constructions for some well-known lattices.\nFinally, in Section 5 we present our conclusions.\n\n2\n\nPreliminaries and Notation\n\nIn this section we give a brief review of some relevant concepts concerning\nlattices and establish the notation to be used from now on.\nGiven m linearly independent vectors b1 , . . . , bm in Rn , a lattice \u039b is\nthe set of all integer linear combinations of these vectors. The matrix G\nwhose rows are the vectors bi is called a generator matrix for \u039b and the\nmatrix A = GGt is said to be a Gram matrix for \u039b. The determinant\nor discriminant of \u039b is defined as det \u039b = det A and corresponds to the\nsquare of the volume of any fundamental region for the lattice \u039b. We\nsay that two lattices with generator matrices G1 and G2 are equivalent if\nthere exists an unimodular matrix U , an orthogonal matrix Q and a real\nnumber c such that G1 = c U G2 Q. The density \u2206 of a lattice is the ratio\nbetween the volume of a sphere of radius \u03c1 (half of the minimal distance\nbetween two distinct lattices points) and the volume of a fundamental\nregion, while the center density is defined as \u03b4 = \u2206/Vn where Vn is the\nvolume of the unitary sphere in Rn . Sometimes we will refer to the center\ndensity of a specific lattice \u039b as \u03b4\u039b .\nLet G be a full-rank generator matrix for \u039b. The dual lattice \u039b\u2217 of\n\u039b is the set of all x \u2208 span(G) such that hx, yi is an integer number\nfor all y \u2208 \u039b, where span(G) is the row space of G. One can easily\nverify that (GGt )\u22121 G generates \u039b\u2217 . We say that \u039b is an integer (or\nrational ) lattice if its generator matrix has integer (rational) entries. All\nrational lattices are integers up to scale. The cubic lattice Zn is the\nfull-dimensional integer self-dual lattice that has the canonical vectors\ne1 = (1, 0, . . . , 0), . . . , en = (0, . . . , 0, 1) as a basis. A list of the densest\nknown packings in some dimensions as well as many other information\nabout lattices can be found in [1].\nWe say that a sequence of lattices \u039bw converges to \u039b if there exist\nGram matrices A for \u039b and Aw for \u039bw such that kAw \u2212 Ak\u221e \u2192 0 as\n3\n\n\fw \u2192 \u221e where kM k\u221e = maxi,j |Mij |. Of course, if \u039bw converges in that\nsense it also converges in any matrix norm. Another matrix norm we use\np\nin this work is the Frobenius norm, given by kM kF = tr(M M t ).\nFinally, we call \u039b1 a projection lattice of \u039b2 if it is obtained by projecting \u039b2 onto the subspace orthogonal to a vector v \u2208 \u039b2 , the projection\nvector. In this paper, a projection lattice will always be a projection of\nthe cubic lattice onto v \u22a5 for v \u2208 Zn+1 a primitive vector (i.e., whose\nentries have greatest common divisor equal to 1). In the context of the\nprojection lattices, the results in [4] and [3] are remarkable. The first\none gives an achievable bound for the density of the projection lattices\ncomparable to the so-called Minkowski-Hlawka bound while the second\none states that every lattice can be approximated by a sequence of lattices that are equivalent to projection lattices. More formally, given a\nn-dimensional lattice \u039b, it is shown that for every \u03b5 > 0, there is a vector\nv \u2208 Zn+1 and a constant c such that there is a Gram matrix Av for the\nlattice obtained by projecting Zn+1 onto v \u22a5 and a Gram matrix A for\n\u039b satisfying kA \u2212 cAv k \u2264 \u03b5. In this work we make a slight modification\non the construction in [3] that leads to many other projection lattices\nsequences converging to a target lattice. We then make an error analysis\nfor these sequences and show a sufficient condition for achieving a faster\norder of convergence, as well as explicit constructions for some important\nlattices.\n\n3\n\nMotivation\n\nConsidering the coding scheme mentioned in Section 1, there are two\nproblems that can arise:\n1. Given a certain radius r0 , what is the vector v \u2208 Zn+1 that maximizes kvk s.t. r(v) = r0 ? Equivalently: given a minimum distance\nfor the projection lattice, what is the vector v \u2208 Zn+1 s.t. the projection of v \u2208 Zn+1 has maximal density? In this case, we want to\nsolve the following maximization problem:\nmax kvk\n\nv\u2208Zn+1\n\nsubject to r(v) = r0 .\n\n4\n\n(3)\n\n\f2. Conversely, given a length l0 what is the the vector v \u2208 Zn+1 with\nkvk = l0 for which r(v) is a maximum ? Equivalently, we want to\nfind the solution to:\nmax r(v)\n\nv\u2208Zn+1\n\nsubject to kvk = l0 .\n\n(4)\n\nWe illustrate these two problems in the case n = 4. We run an\nexhaustive search to solve the maximization problem (4) for 2 \u2264 l0 \u2264\n\u221a\n270478 (i.e., fixing kvk = l0 ). Some examples are illustrated in Table 3.\nFrom this table, we can guess a good solution for the problem (3), where\nr0 is fixed.\nFor instance, take r0 = 0.16385. The fourth element of the family of\nprojection lattices onto (1, 2w2 \u2212 w + 1, 2w2 + w + 1, 4w2 + 3w)\u22a5 has minimal distance 0.163858, center density 0.164452 and squared norm 89425.\nAmong the vectors of similar norm, we can find similar performances (e.g.,\nthe lattice produced by the vector (1, 157, 164, 195) has minimal distance,\ncenter density and squared norm equal to 0.16386, 0.164594 and 89571\nrespectively).\nNow, take r0 = 0.1721 and the fourth element of the sequence of projections determined by the vectors (1, 2w2 \u2212 w + 1, 2w2 + w + 1, 4w3 + 3w)\n(which is an \"optimal\" sequence in the sense discussed in this paper). It\nhas minimal distance, center density and squared norm equal to 0.172147,\n0.173511 and 74035. Comparing this to the vector (1, 13, 75, 244), which is\n\"close\" to (1, 29, 37, 268) in the sense of these parameters, we find out that\nalthough the last one has a slightly smaller norm (65331), its center density is much smaller (0.163112). There is clearly a tradeoff between these\nparameters. Finally, let us fix the vector length around kvk22 = 89425.\nThe fourth element of the first family above-cited produces a projection\nlattice with parameters \"close\" to the ones of the vector (1, 31, 38, 295)\n(minimal distance, center density and squared norm equal to 0.163988,\n0.164852 and 89431). On the other hand, there is no vector (with norm\nup to 89425) producing denser lattices than the fourth element of the optimal sequence, but within the interval 74035 and 89425 there are many\nother vectors that generate lattices with density superior to 0.163858, as\nshown in Table 1.\n\n5\n\n\fprojection vector v\n(1, 29, 37, 268)\n(1, 56, 185, 196)\n(1, 121, 163, 187)\n(1, 33, 80, 265)\n(1, 98, 125, 230)\n(1, 107, 141, 222)\n(1, 42, 181, 215)\n(1, 8, 110, 265)\n(1, 12, 84, 282)\n(1, 91, 153, 236)\n(1, 119, 152, 224)\n(1, 88, 121, 256)\n(1, 8, 64, 292)\n\nCenter density Minimal norm\n0.173511\n0.172147\n0.16502\n0.168637\n0.170589\n0.170362\n0.16473\n0.16783\n0.168027\n0.168793\n0.166704\n0.167472\n0.166423\n0.167331\n0.165716\n0.166535\n0.164198\n0.164612\n0.166189\n0.165065\n0.165562\n0.16484\n0.16497\n0.164493\n0.164452\n0.163858\n\nkvk22\n74035\n75778\n76180\n77715\n78130\n80615\n80751\n82390\n86725\n87387\n87442\n87922\n89425\n\nTable 1: Dense projection lattices of Z4 onto v \u22a5 , for 74035 \u2264 kvk \u2264\n89425.\n\n4\n\nConvergence rate analysis\n\nLet \u039b \u2282 Rn be a lattice with a n \u00d7 n generator matrix \u1e20 and consider\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0003\nn\u00d7n generator matrix \u1e20\u2217 to \u039b\u2217 .

If G is a lower triangular matrix and P = [0n\u00d71 In\u00d7n ] it is shown in [3] that each \u039bw (dual of\n\u039b\u2217w ) is the projection of Zn+1 onto the subspace orthogonal to some vector\nv \u2208 Zn+1 and the sequence of Gram matrices (A\u2217w )/c = (G\u2217w Gtw )/c \u2192 A\u2217\n6\n\n\fas w \u2192 \u221e (hence, cAw \u2192 A), for c = w2 . A natural extension of this\nresult is the following:\nLemma 4.1. Let G\u2217w (5) and Hw be the matrices defined above. If Hw is\nunimodular for all w \u2208 N then the lattices \u039bw associated to the generator\nmatrices Gw are projection lattices.\nProof. Since Hw is unimodular so is its inverse and \u039b\u2217w is also generated\nby Hw\u22121 G\u2217w . On the other hand, Hw\u22121 G\u2217w = [v\u0302w In\u00d7n ] and for the same\narguments of [4], \u039b\u2217w is the intersection of Zn+1 with the subspace orthogonal to the vector vw = (1, \u2212v\u0302w ), which is the dual of the projection of\n\u22a5.\nZn+1 onto vw\nIn the sequel we will consider the analysis of the convergence order\nof the sequence w2 Aw (i.e., the sequence of duals of (5)). We start by\nanalysing the sequence (5). It is straightforward to show that 1/w2 A\u2217w \u2192\nA\u2217 with order O(1/w) since\nA\u2217 \u2212 (1/w2 )A\u2217w\n\n\u221e\n\n=\n\nQ1 Q0\n+ 2\nw\nw\n\n= O(1/w).\n\u221e\n\nIf Q1 = 0, we obtain an O(1/w2 ) convergence order, as it happens\nin the example of [3], Section 4. More generally, if Q1 = \u03b1A\u2217 , we can\nevaluate A\u2217w as follows:\n\u0010\n\u03b1 \u00112 \u03b1 2 A \u2217\nA\u2217w = w2 A\u2217 + \u03b1wA\u2217 + Q0 = A\u2217 w +\n\u2212\n+ P P t,\n2\n4\ntherefore the sequence A\u2217w /(w + \u03b1/2)2 (i.e., taking c = (w + \u03b1/2)2 ) converges to A\u2217w with rate O(1/w2 ). Nevertheless, our main objective is\nthe analysis of the sequence \u039bw . In what follows, we will show that the\nasymptotic behavior of \u039bw is essentially the same as \u039b\u2217w , although for\nfinite w they may differ. In order to show this, we will need the following\nlemma.\nLemma 4.2. Let A\u2217w be Gram matrices for \u039b\u2217w as in Equation (6).

Taking the\n\u0002\n\u0003k\nmatrix power, we can make (w2 A\u2217 )\u22121 (wQ1 + Q0 ) < \u03b5 for any \u03b5 > 0\nand the result follows.\nAs a consequence of the above lemma, we have:\n\n2\n\nA \u2212 w Aw\n\n=\n\n\u0015k\n\u221e \u0014\nX\nA\n(\u2212wQ1 \u2212 Q0 ) A \u2248\nw2\nk=1\n\n\u2248\n\nAQ1 A AQ0 A\n+\n= O(1/w).\nw\nw2\n\nAgain, if Q1 = \u03b1A\u2217 (\u21d4 AQ1 A = \u03b1A), we obtain an O(1/w2 ) convergence\nthrough the evaluation\nA\n\u03b1A AQ0 A\n\u2212 3 +\n=A\n2\nw\nw\nw4\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n\u03b1\n\u2212\nw 2w2\n\n\u00132\n+\n\n\u03b12 A AQ0 A\n+\n4w4\nw4\n\n\u00012\nso that the distance from Aw / 1/w \u2212 \u03b1/2w2 to A has order O(1/w2 ).\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u00112\n1\n\u03b1 2 \u0010\u03b1\nRemark 4.3.

Now, take the sequence of lattices \u039b\u2217w,1 associated to\nthe generator matrices G\u2217w,1 = wG\u22171 +P1 and let Hw,1 = (G\u2217w,1 )(1,...,n),(2,...,n+1)\nsuch that conditions (9) and (10) hold. There exists P2 \u2208 Zn\u00d7(n+1) such\nthat the sequence G\u2217w,2 = wG\u22172 + P2 satisfies conditions (9), (10) and\n\u22121 \u2217\n\u22121 \u2217\nHw,1\nG1 = Hw,2\nG2 .\n\n(13)\n\nProof. Since G\u22171 and G\u22172 generate the same lattice, there exists an unimodular matrix U such that G\u22171 = U G\u22172 . We will show that P2 = U \u22121 P1\nsatisfies the three properties above.\nFor condition (9), we have:\n\u22121 \u2217 t \u2212t\n\u2212t\nG1 P1 U + U \u22121 P2\u2217 G\u2217t\n=\nG\u22172 P2t + P2\u2217 G\u2217t\n2 =U\n1 U\n\n= U \u22121 (G\u22171 P1t + P1 G\u22171 t)U \u2212t = \u03b1U \u22121 A\u22171 U \u2212t = \u03b1A\u22172\n\n(14)\n\nFor condition (10) and Equation (13), just observe that Hw,2 = U \u22121 Hw,1 .\n\nAlthough the search for good sequences is independent of the basis\nchoice, distinct representations (i.e., geometrically similiar) for the same\nlattice can yield substantially different sequences in terms of the densities\nof \u039bw and the norm of each vw , as shown in Equation (11) and illustrated\nin examples 3.1 and 3.4.\n\n10\n\n\fWhen there is no perturbation matrix such that Q1 = \u03b1A\u2217 , the convergence of the sequence Aw /w2 is related to the coefficient A(Q1 \u2212\u03b1A\u2217 )A.\nWe can thus try the solution of the problem\nmin A(G\u2217 P t + P G\u2217t \u2212 \u03b1A\u2217 )A\n\ns. t. | det Hw | = 1 , \u2200w \u2208 N\n\n(15)\n\nP \u2208 Zn\u00d7(n+1)\n\u03b1\u2208Z\nwhich is a non-linear problem of n2 + n integer variables.

We can\nassume w.l.o.g. that (a, b) = 1. As a generator matrix for its dual, we\nchoose \u1e20\u2217 = diag(a, b), and hence, taking a general perturbation P , we\nhave:\n\"\nGw =\n\naw + P1,1\nP1,2\nP1,3\nP2,1\nbw + P2,2 P2,3\n\n#\n(17)\n\nIn this case, the condition (10) is equivalent to:\nbP12\n\u03b1b\na\u03b1\n, P21 = \u2212\nand P22 =\n(18)\n2\na\n2\nSince a and b have no common factors, \u03b1 must be even (\u03b1 = 2\u03b2, for \u03b2 \u2208 Z)\nand P12 = ka. Under these conditions, we calculate the determinant of\nHw :\ndet(Hw ) = akP23 \u2212 b\u03b2P13 \u2212 bwP13\n(19)\nP11 =\n\nand condition (9) will be satisfied iff\nP13 = 0 and akP23 = \u00b11.\n\n(20)\n\nHence, by Theorem (4.4), any lattice of the form Z \u2295 bZ, b 6= 0 can be\nrecovered as a sequence (5) or projection lattices whose order of convergence is O(1/ kvk), while for a 6= 1 it is not possible to find a perturbation\nmatrix such that the hypotheses of Theorem (4.4) hold.\nAs an interesting consequence of this fact, it is not possible to ensure\nconditions (9) and (10) to the Example 1 of [4] scaled by 1/2 i.e., for\na = 2 and b = 1.

Under that condition, we have:\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8f9\n\u22122P23 + 2P31 \u2212 2P33 \u22122P23 \u2212 2P33 0\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\nHw = \uf8f0 \u2212w + P23 \u2212 P31 + P33\nP23\nP24 \uf8fb\nw + P33\nP33 \u2212 w\nP34\n\n(26)\n\nand clearly det Hw is even i.e., det Hw 6= \u00b11 what shows that there is\nno P such that, for \u03b1 = 0, the conditions (9) and (10) simultaneously\nhold. However, following an analogous argument for \u03b1 = 1, we find the\nperturbation matrix:\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8f9\n\u22121 1\n1\n0\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\nP = \uf8f0 0 \u22121 0\n1 \uf8fb.\n0\n0 \u22121 \u22122\n\n(27)\n\nWe extended this result for any n through the following proposition:\nProposition 5.3. There is a sequence of projection lattices that converges\nto Dn\u2217 for any n \u2265 1 at the rate O(1/ kvk2/n ).\nProof. Here, the perurbation matrix is given by\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\ni n\u22121\n\uf8f4\n(\u22121)\nif j = n + 1 and i \u2265 2,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\ni\u22121\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\u22121\nif i = j,\nPij =\n.\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n1\nif i = 1 and j \u2264 n,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n0\notherwise\n\n(28)\n\nAgain, by direct multiplication we can see that G\u2217 P t +P G\u2217t = A\u2217 (\u03b1 = 1)\nand by applying elementary operations to the matrix Hw we see that\ndet Hw = (\u22121)n+1 proving the statement.\n15\n\n\fFor n = 3 the projection family associated to the vectors\n\u0002\n\u0003\nvw = 1, \u22122w2 + w + 1, \u22122w2 \u2212 3w \u2212 2, 2w3 + 3w2 + 3w + 1\nconverges to the famous body-centered cubic lattice, which has the best\ncovering density in three dimensions [3], at a rate O(1/ kvk2/3 ).\n\n5.4\n\nThe lattice E8\n\nFor the lattice E8 , the problem of finding a perturbation matrix that\nspeeds the convergence rate up to O(1/w2 ) has 72 integer variables. After some simplifications (by explicitly solving equation (9)) we can reduce\nthis problem to 36 integer variables and 7 non-linear restrictions, corresponding to the polynomial equality (10), which has a high computational\ncomplexity. We do not know if there exists an exact solution to this problem. Hence, we generate sub-optimal solutions, considering the problem\n(16) and the Frobenius norm, which yields to a quadratic integer problem (IQP), and show that these solutions have good (exponential) gains\nin comparison to the sequences in [3]. We also compare different equivalent integer representations for the E8 lattice. It is worth reminding that\nkM kF \u2265 kM k\u221e for any matrix M .\nThe first representation for \u039b\u2217 = E8 is the matrix [1, p. 121], the same\nas in [3]. The second one is the matrix obtained by applying Construction\nA [1, ch.5] to the extended Hamming code H(8, 4) [1, ch 3,sec 2.3]. We\nshow the perturbation matrices found in both cases (respectively, P1 and\nP2 ) and compare the curves of center density versus the the logarithm to\nthe basis 2 of the euclidean norm of the projection vector (Figure 1). For\nall these constructions, the rate of convergence of the produced sequences\nis O(1/w).\n\n16\n\n\f\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n0 1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0 0 0\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n0\n0\n0\n0 0 0\uf8fa\n\uf8ef0 \u22121 1\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef0 \u22121 \u22121 1\n0\n0\n0 0 0\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef0 1 \u22121 \u22121 1\n0\n0 0 0\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\nP1 = \uf8ef\n\uf8fa,\n\uf8ef0 0\n1 \u22121 \u22121 1\n0 0 0\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef0 0\n0\n1 \u22121 \u22121 1 0 0\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n0\n0\n1 \u22121 \u22121 1 0\uf8fb\n\uf8f00 0\n0 0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0 0 1\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n0 1\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0\uf8fa\n\uf8ef0 0\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef0 0\n0 1 0 0 0 0 0\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef0 \u22121 0 1 1 0 0 0 0\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\nP2 = \uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef0 1\n0 0 0 1 0 0 0\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef0 0\n\uf8fa\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8f00 0 \u22121 1 0 0 0 1 0\uf8fb\n0 0\n0 0 1 1 \u22121 0 1\n\n6\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this paper we address the problem of finding sequences of projection\nlattices with a good rate \"density versus length of the projection vector\". With a subtle modification of the Lifting Construction [4], we prove\na sufficient condition for constructing projection lattices sequences that\nconverge with order O(1/ kvk2/n ) to target lattices whose dual are integer. We then construct explicit examples of such sequences for some\nwell-known lattices, such as Dn (odd n) and Dn\u2217 . We also show examples\nof good projection lattices sequences for the E8 lattice that do not satisfy\ncondition (10).\nThe question whether it is always possible to speed the convergence\nrate up to O(1/ kvk2/n ) remains open. Also explicit constructions for Dn\n(even n) as well as other important lattices are let for further work. These\nconstructions, however, seem to require totally different techniques.
