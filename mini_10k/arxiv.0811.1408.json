Their name stems from\nvon Heusler who first studied the Cu-Mn-Al system in\n1903.1 The interest on these alloys has been recently revived due the half-metallic character exhibited by some\nsemi-Heuslers; i.e. compounds for which one spin channel is semiconducting or insulating whereas the other\nhas a metallic character, leading to 100% carrier spinpolarization at the Fermi level (EF ). Half-metallic ferromagnetism (HMF) was initialy proposed by de Groot\net al. in 1983 when studying the band structure of the\nNiMnSb Heusler compound.2 Also members of the family of the so-called full-Heusler alloys like Co2 MnZ (Z=Si\nand Ge) have been predicted to be half-metals.3\nEarly measurements by Webster et al. on several quaternary Heusler alloys, as well as recent studies of Walle\net al. on AuMnSn1\u2212x Sbx , demonstrated the importance\nof the sp electrons in establishing the magnetic properties\nof Heusler compounds.4,5 On the other hand, the importance of the non-magnetic 3d atoms, like Cu, for the magnetism of Heusler alloys has been also revealed recently\nby the experimental studies of Duong et al. and Ren et\nal. in the case of Co1\u2212x Cux MnSb and Ni1\u2212x Cux MnSb\nalloys, respectively.6,7\nAuthors have shown in Ref. 8 that when Ni atoms\nare substituted by Cu ones in the half-metallic NiMnSb\nalloy, first the half-metallicity is lost and for large Cu\nconcentrations the Ni1\u2212x Cux MnSb alloys become antiferrognetic; the phase transition occurs for a concentration x \u2243 0.6. We have to note here that CuMnSb is\na well-known antiferromagnet and has been extensively\nstudied both experimentally9 and theoretically.10 The exchange coupling mechanism in Mn-based Heusler alloys\n\nhas been well-understood11 and for half-metallic systems\nit has been shown in Ref. 8 that the magnetic interactions depend strongly on the position of the Fermi level\nwithin the gap. As the concentration in Cu is increasing the Fermi level is shifted higher in energy with respect to the minority-spin gap and at the transition point\nit crosses enough the minority-spin conduction band so\nthat the antiferromagnetic superexchange coupling of the\nMn-Mn spin moments through the Cu atoms dominates\nover the ferromagnetic RKKY-like interaction between\nthe Mn atoms.\nIn the semi-Heusler alloys of the chemical type AuMnZ\n(Z=In, Sn, Sb), the magnetization is confined to the Mn\nsublattice and the Mn spin moments are well-localized in\nspace due to the large Mn-Mn distance, i.e. the 3d states\nbelonging to different Mn atoms do not overlap considerably. M. Amft and P. M. Oppeneer calculated the largest\nzero-temperature polar Kerr rotation (-0.45 degree at\nabout 1 eV photon energy) for AuMnSn.12 AuMnSn alloy is isovalent (same number of valence electrons in the\nprimitive unit cell) to NiMnSb and AuMnSb is isovalent to CuMnSb. Thus the phase magnetic diagram\nof AuMnSn1\u2212x Sbx and Ni1\u2212x Cux MnSb compounds can\nbe directly compared. In this Brief Report we employ\nthe full\u2013potential nonorthogonal local\u2013orbital minimum\u2013\nbasis band structure scheme (FPLO)13 within the local\ndensity approximation (LDA)14 to study the phase diagram of the quaternary AuMnSn1\u2212x Sbx alloys and compare it with our published results on Ni1\u2212x Cux MnSb\ncompounds. We simulate the disorder within the the\ncoherent potential approximation (CPA) framework. Details of the calculations are similar to the ones presented\nin Ref. 8. We have used the theoretical calculated equilibrium lattice constants: 5.83\u00c5 for NiMnSb, 5.99 \u00c5 for\nCuMnSb, 6.333 \u00c5 for AuMnSn, and 6.464 \u00c5 for AuMnSb.\n\n\f2\nFM\nAFM\n\nAuMnSn1-xSbx\n\nAuMnSn1-xSbx\n\nNi1-xCuxMnSb\n\n3\n\n5.0\n\nNi1-xCuxMnSb\n\nx = 0.0\n\nx = 0.6\n\nx = 0.0\n\nx = 0.6\n\nx = 0.2\n\nx = 0.8\n\nx = 0.2\n\nx = 0.8\n\nx = 0.4\n\nx = 1.0\n\nx = 0.4\n\nx = 1.0\n\n0\n4.8\n\nDOS (states/eV)\n\nTotal magnetic moment (\u03bc\u0392)\n\n5.2\n\n4.6\n4.4\n4.2\n\n-3\n3\n0\n-3\n3\n\n4.0\n\n0\n\n3.8\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\nSb content (x)\n\n10\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nCu content (x)\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) Calculated total spin moments (in\n\u03bcB ) as a function of the concentration (x) for the studied\nAuMnSn1\u2212x Sbx and Ni1\u2212x Cux MnSb in the ferromagnetic\n(FM) configuration. We present also the Mn spin moment in\nthe antiferromagnetic (AFM) configurations for comparison.\nThe solid black lines represent the Slater-Pauling behavior.\n\nThese are slightly different than the experimental ones:\n5.93 \u00c5 for NiMnSb, 6.09 \u00c5 for CuMnSb, 6.341 \u00c5 for\nAuMnSn and 6.379 \u00c5 for AuMnSb.4,15 We should note\nhere that we performed test calculations also for the experimental lattice constants but results were almost identical to the case of the theoretical lattice parameters. We\nassumed that the lattice constant for the quaternary alloys varies linearly wit the concentration x. We show\nthat AuMnSn1\u2212x Sbx alloys present a similar magnetic\nphase diagram with the Ni1\u2212x Cux MnSb compounds and\nthe tuning of the magnetic properties is insensitive to\nthe origin of the conduction electrons which mediate the\nMn-Mn interactions.\nWe will start our discussion from the calculated spin\nmagnetic moments presented in Fig. 1. We have drawn\nthe total magnetic moments for the AuMnSn1\u2212x Sbx and\nNi1\u2212x Cux MnSb alloys as a function of the concentration\nfor the ferromagnetic state in Fig. 1. The solid black\nlines represent the Slater-Pauling (SP) behavior obeyed\nby the perfect half metallic ferromagnets (the total spin\nmoment in \u03bcB is the number of valence electrons minus\n18)16 . We present the Mn magnetic moment corresponding to the antiferromagnetic state for comparison. We\nshould note that the spin magnetic moments of Au, Ni\nand Cu are zero in the antiferromagnetic (AFM) state\ndue to symmetry reasons while the Sb and Sn atoms\nhave a very small magnetic moment value. For x = 0\nthe AuMnSn compound has a total spin moment slightly\nlarger than the ideal 4 \u03bcB predicted by the SP rule for the\nperfect half-metallic ferromagnets since the Fermi level is\nslightly below the gap as can be seen in Fig. 2 where we\nhave drawn the total density of state (DOS) for both\nfamilies of compounds.

The AuMnSn1\u2212x Sbx\nand Ni1\u2212x Cux MnSb follow the SP rule up to x \u2243 0.5\nand x \u2243 0.2, respectively, and at this point the halfmetallicity is lost since the Fermi level is shifted and\nnow crosses the minority-spin conduction band. This is\nclearly shown in Fig. 2. The shift of the Fermi level\ntowards higher energies is easily understood. When we\nincrease the concentration of Sb and Cu atoms, we dope\nthe system with p charge. The corresponding majorityspin p states are extremely extended in energy and thus,\nwhen their occupation increases, they push the Fermi\nlevel higher in energy.\nTo reveal the mechanism for the loss of the halfmetallic character we have to study the atom-resolved\nspin magnetic moments for the ferromagnetic configuration presented in Table I. The spin magnetic moment of Au, Sn and Sb atoms changes from -0.022, 0.155 and -0.100 to 0.118, -0.020 and 0.044 \u03bcB , respectively, with increasing of the Sb concentration in\nthe AuMnSn1\u2212x Sbx compound. These atoms have almost filled electronic shells, since they provide electronic\nbands, much deeper in energy than the Mn ones,16 and\nthey contribute marginally to the total spin moment.\nThus the extra electron provided by the Sb atom has\nto be accommodated by the bands provided by the Mn\natom. For AuMnSn, the spin magnetic moment of Mn is\n4.192 \u03bcB and thus most of the five majority-spin states\nare occupied.

The calculated magnetic moments are in good agreement with experimental values\nof AuMnSn17 and AuMnSb18 compounds. In the case\nof Ni1\u2212x Cux MnSb alloys the same phenomenon occurs:\nNi, Cu and Sb atoms carry very small spin moments and\nMn increases its spin moment by 0.31 \u03bcB when all Ni\natoms are substituted by Cu ones leading to the loss of\nthe half-metallicity.\nIn the antiferromagnetic (AFM) state, Sb and Sn\nhave a very small magnetic moment while the magnetic moment of Au is zero in AuMnSn1\u2212x Sbx compound\ndue to symmetry reasons. Similarly in the case of the\nNi1\u2212x Cux MnSb alloys, Ni and Cu have zero spin moments, while Sb has a very small magnetic moment. The\ncloseness in value between the Mn spin moments in FM\nand AFM configurations shown in Fig. 1 can be understood if we examine the Mn-resolved DOS shown for\n\nFIG. 4: (Color online) Ground state magnetic phase diagram\nand total energy differences between AFM and FM configurations of the Mn magnetic moments in AuMnSn1\u2212x Sbx and\nNi1\u2212x Cux MnSb as a function of the concentration (x). In the\ninset we show the total spin polarization of the conduction\nelectrons of X (Au, Ni, Cu) and Z (Sn and Sb) atoms as a\nfunction of the concentration (x). Note that the energy differences are given for an antiferromagnetic unit cell, while spin\npolarization of the conduction electrons is given for a FM unit\ncell\n\nall four CuMnSb, NiMnSb, AuMnSn and AuMnSb compounds in Fig. 3. Both in the FM and AFM cases Mn\natoms present a similar DOS and the small broadening of\nthe bands in the AFM state occurs due to the stronger\nhybridization with the other atoms in this case. The\nimportant point is that the similar DOS in the FM and\nAFM cases justifies the use of the Anderson s\u2212d model to\ninterpret the results on the quaternary AuMnSn1\u2212x Sbx\nalloys as in Ref. 8 for the Ni1\u2212x Cux MnSb alloys.\nAs we have mentioned above both AuMnSn1\u2212x Sbx and\nNi1\u2212x Cux MnSb quaternary compounds loose their half\nmetallic character at a concentration of x \u2243 0.5 and\nx \u2243 0.2, respectively. For these values of the concentration the Fermi level enters the minority-spin conduction band but the ferromagnetism is still favorable with\nrespect to the AFM state. To study the phase transition, we have calculated the total energies for both the\nFM and the AFM configurations of the Mn spin mag-\n\n\f4\nnetic moments. All energy calculations have been performed using the large AFM unit cell (which is double\nthe FM unit cell). We determine the zero temperature\nmagnetic phase diagram as the difference of the corresponding total energies (EAF M \u2212 EF M ) per AFM unit\ncell and we present our results in Fig. 4. AuMnSn1\u2212x Sbx\nshows a phase transition from a FM to an AFM coupling\nof the Mn spin moments for a critical concentration value\nx \u2243 0.7. As seen in Figs. 2 and 3 when we substitute Sb\nfor Sn, the Fermi level moves towards higher energies and\nthe number of the minority states just above the Fermi\nlevel increases. This gives rise to an opposite behavior in\nthe relative contributions of the exchange mechanisms: a\ndecrease for the RKKY-like coupling and an increase in\nthe superexchange mechanism. At the transition point\nboth mechanisms cancel each other and further increase\nof x leads to an antiferromagnetic order due to the dominating character of the superexchange mechanism. The\nvalue for the transition for the AuMnSn1\u2212x Sbx alloys\nis very close to the transition value of x \u2243 0.6 calculated already for Ni1\u2212x Cux MnSb in Ref. 8 and reproduced here. The similar behavior of the two families of\nalloys can be traced in the spin-polarization of the conduction electrons of the Au,Sn and Sb atoms (Ni,Cu,Sb\nin the case of Ni1\u2212x Cux MnSb) presented in the inset of\nFig. 4 which is similar for both families of alloys. These\nelectrons are responsible for the coupling between the\ndistinct Mn localized spin magnetic moments. The role\nof the spin-polarization of the conduction electrons and\ntheir connection to the phase diagram have been largely\ndiscussed in Ref. 8.\nWe should finally note that we have examined also\nthe influence of the electron-correlation on the magnetic\nphase diagram for the AuMnSn1\u2212x Sbx alloys taken into\naccount using the popular LDA+U scheme.19 We have\nassumed a value for the Mn exchange-splitting constant\n\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\u2021\n1\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\nElectronic address: kozdogan@gyte.edu.tr\nElectronic address: galanakis@upatras.gr\nElectronic address: e.sasioglu@fz-juelich.de\nF.

LDA+U should push the Mn\nunoccupied minority states higher in energy similarly to\nthe effect of the expansion of the lattice constant. But\nfor AuMnSb this shift of the states is very small revealing\nthat correlations do not play a crucial role for the description of these alloys. As a result the EAF M \u2212 EF M varies\nbetween -156.15 and -155.39 meV as U changes from 3\nto 5 eV (close to the value of \u223c -200 meV when U is not\nincluded in the calculations) and the AFM state remains\nthe ground state. Thus the inclusion of the correlations\nin our electronic-structure calculations only slightly shifts\nthe transition point to lower Sb concentration.\nWe have studied the effect of the variation of the\nconcentration of the sp electrons on the electronic and\nmagnetic properties of the quaternary AuMnSn1\u2212x Sbx\n(0 \u2264 x \u2264 1) Heusler alloys using first principles calculations. We determine their magnetic phase diagram\nand we show that they present a phase transition from\na ferromagnetic to an antiferromagnetic state with increasing Sb concentration. For large Sb concentrations\nthe antiferromagnetic superexchange coupling dominates\nover the ferromagnetic RKKY-like exchange mechanism.\nElectronic correlation effects have a marginal effect on\nthe magnetic phase diagram of these compounds. This is\nan alternative route for tuning the magnetic properties\nof the Heusler alloys with respect to the variation of the\nnon-magnetic 3d atoms shown for Ni1\u2212x Cux MnSb alloys\n[I.
