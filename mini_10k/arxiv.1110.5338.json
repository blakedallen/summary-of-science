The longest standing of\nthese claims is from the DAMA (and more recently the\nDAMA/LIBRA) collaboration, which has reported annual variation in the event rate at their lowest observed\nenergies, in keeping with the predictions from dark matter scattering [1]. Earlier this year, the CoGeNT collaboration reported that their previously observed excess of\nlow-energy events also exhibits seasonal variation [2, 3],\nsimilar to the signal reported by DAMA/LIBRA. Most\nrecently, the CRESST-II collaboration has reported an\nexcess of events potentially attributable to dark matter [4].\nA casual comparison of these results can be confusing\nor even misleading. Conventionally, both experimentalists and theorists in the field of dark matter direct detection report their constraints and other results as derived\nusing specific astrophysical assumptions and estimates\nof detector response. Adopting a single choice for each\nof these characteristics (even if that choice represents a\nreasonable estimate), rather than marginalizing over the\npossible or plausible range of those choices, can lead to\nregions of compatibility that are artificially small, and to\nconstraints which are artificially stringent.\nIn this paper, we revisit the signals reported by the\nCRESST-II, CoGeNT and DAMA/LIBRA collaborations, and attempt to determine whether they can be\nconsistently explained with dark matter. In particular,\nin Sec. II, we study and directly compare the spectra\nof excess events reported by CoGeNT and CRESST-II,\nand from this conclude that (for reasonable astrophysical assumptions) a dark matter particle with a mass of\n\nroughly 10-20 GeV and an elastic scattering cross section\nwith nucleons of approximately (1\u22123)\u00d710\u221241 cm2 could\naccount for the excess events reported by each of these\ncollaborations. We also note that a sizable fraction of\nthis parameter space is consistent with the constraints\nplaced by the CDMS-II collaboration. The constraints\npresented by the XENON-100 and XENON-10 collaborations, however, remain in conflict, unless either the\nresponse of liquid xenon to very low-energy nuclear recoils is lower than previously claimed, or the dark matter's couplings to protons and neutrons destructively interfere for a xenon target. In Sec. III, we compare the annual modulation signals reported by the DAMA/LIBRA\nand CoGeNT collaborations. Again, we find good agreement between the results of these two experiments, but\npoint out that under common assumptions (Maxwellian\nvelocity distributions and velocity independent scattering cross sections), the amplitude of the observed modulation requires the dark matter to possess a significantly\nlarger (by a factor of approximately 3\u201310) elastic scattering cross section than would be inferred from the spectra reported by CoGeNT and CRESST-II. In Sec. IV A,\nwe explore how this apparent discrepancy between the\nobserved event rate and modulation amplitude could potentially be resolved by the presence of streams or other\nnon-Maxwellian velocity structures in the local distribution of dark matter, or by dark matter with a velocitydependent scattering cross section with nuclei. In Sec. V,\nwe summarize our results and draw conclusions.\n\nII.\n\nTHE NUCLEAR RECOIL SPECTRUM\n\nThe CoGeNT and CRESST-II collaborations have\neach reported an excess of nuclear recoil candidate events,\ndifficult to attribute to known backgrounds. In this sec-\n\n\f2\ntion, we discuss the energy spectra of these events and\nthe dark matter parameter space which could potentially\naccount for these signals.\n\nA.\n\nCoGeNT's Event Spectrum\n\nCoGeNT is a P-type point contact germanium detector with very low levels of electronic noise, enabling sensitivity to very low-energy nuclear recoils, and thus very\nlow mass dark matter particles. Located in Northern\nMinnesota's Soudan Underground Laboratory, CoGeNT\nobserves nuclear recoil events as ionization, and has thus\nfar reported the results of 15 months of data collection,\ntaken between December 2009 and March 2011 [2, 3].\nIn the upper-left frame of Fig. 1, we show the spectrum of events reported by CoGeNT as a function of\nionization energy (in keV-electron equivalent, keVee), after subtracting the L-shell electron capture peaks (as described in Ref. [5]). Above about 1.5 keVee, the spectrum\nobserved by CoGeNT is approximately flat and featureless, and is thought to be dominated by Compton scattering events. At lower energies, the observed rate climbs\nrapidly. While contamination from (non-rejected) surface events is expected to contribute significantly near\nthreshold, it does not appear to be possible to account\nfor the observed low-energy rate with this or other known\nbackgrounds.\nTo assess the hypothesis that the excess events reported by CoGeNT are the product of the elastic scattering of dark matter particles, we compare CoGeNT's event\nspectrum to that predicted from dark matter. The spectrum (in nuclear recoil energy) of dark matter induced\nelastic scattering events is given by [6]\nZ\nd\u03c3\ndR\n\u03c1DM\nd3 v vf (~v , v~e )\n= NT\n,\n(1)\ndER\nmDM |~v|>vmin\ndER\nwhere NT is the number of target nuclei, mDM is the\nmass of the dark matter particle, \u03c1DM is the local dark\nmatter density (which we take to be 0.3 GeV/cm3 ), ~v is\nthe dark matter velocity in the frame of the Earth, v~e\nis the velocity of the Earth with respect to the Galactic halo, and f (~v , v~e ) is the distribution function of dark\nmatter particle velocities, which we will take to be the\nstandard Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution for the time\nbeing:\nf (~v , v~e ) =\n\n1\n(\u03c0v02 )3/2\n\n2\n\ne\u2212(~v+v~e )\n\n/v02\n\n.\n\n(2)\n\nThe Earth's speed relative to the Galactic halo is given by\nve = v +vorb cos \u03b3 cos[\u03c9(t\u2212t0 )] where v = v0 +12 km/s,\nvorb = 30km/s, cos \u03b3 = 0.51, t0 is the date of the peak\nin the annual modulation (generally anticipated to lie\nwithin several weeks of late May or early June), and\n\u03c9 = 2\u03c0/year. As a default choice, we adopt the commonly used values of v0 = 220 m/s and a Galactic escape\nvelocity of 544 km/s. This function should be thought of\n\nas a reasonable, but approximate, parametrization of the\ndark matter's true velocity distribution. Departures from\na Maxwellian velocity distribution are in fact required for\nconsistency with observed (and simulated) halo density\nprofiles (see, for example, Ref. [8] and references therein).\nSuch departures can non-negligibly impact the spectrum\nof dark matter induced events, and can significantly modify the degree of seasonal variation in the rate [7, 8]. In\nSec. IV A, we will return to this issue and examine the extent to which non-Maxwellian structures in the velocity\ndistribution could potentially impact the signals reported\nby direct detection experiments.\nAs the germanium isotopes which make up the CoGeNT detector contain little net spin, we consider spinindependent interactions to generate the observed events.\nIn this case, we have\n2\n\nmN \u03c3n [fp Z + fn (A \u2212 Z)] 2\nd\u03c3\nF (q),\n=\ndER\n2v 2 \u03bc2n\nfn2\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03bcn is the reduced mass of the dark matter particle and nucleon (proton or neutron), \u03c3n is the scattering\ncross section of the dark matter particle with neutrons, Z\nand A are the atomic and mass numbers of the nucleus,\nand fn,p are the couplings of the dark matter particle to\nneutrons and protons, respectively. Unless stated otherwise, our results are calculated under the assumption\nthat fp = fn . The nuclear form factor, F (q), accounts for\nthe finite momentum transfer in scattering events. In our\ncalculations, we adopt the Helm form factor with parameters as described in our previous work [9]. To convert\nfrom nuclear recoil energy to the measured ionization energy, we have scaled the results by the quenching factor\nfor germanium as described in Refs. [10, 11] (QGe = 0.218\nat ER =3 keV, and with the energy dependence predicted\nby the Lindhard theory [12]).\nAlthough the majority of surface events have been removed from the spectrum presented by the CoGeNT collaboration through the application of a rise-time cut, this\nspectrum does not take into account any inefficiencies in\ntheir surface event rejection algorithm. While it was initially estimated that the signal would suffer only a minor degree of contamination from non-rejected surface\nevents [2], the CoGeNT collaboration has recently reported a somewhat higher estimate for the rate of nonrejected surface events near their energy threshold [13].\nThis (preliminary) estimate of the fraction of the event\nspectrum which consists of non-surface events (i.e. nuclear recoil candidate events) is shown in Fig. 2. Any\nunidentified surface events constitute an additional background that should be accounted for when attempting to\nidentify a dark matter signal from the CoGeNT detector.\nAs can be observed from Fig. 2, this new measurement\nsignificantly reduces the estimate of the number of lowenergy events that could potentially be attributed to dark\nmatter. The precision of this measurement is expected\nto improve over time as more statistics are accumulated.\nIn Fig. 1, we show the spectrum events at CoGeNT,\nfor several different choices of the surface event correction\n\n\fmDM =8 GeV\n-40\n\n\u03a3DM-n = 1.2\u00d710\n\n15\n\n2\n\ncm\n\n10\n5\n0\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n8\n\nCounts kg-1 day-1 keVee-1\n\nCounts kg-1 day-1 keVee-1\n\n8\n\n20\n\nE HkeVeeL\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\nmDM =10 GeV\n\n4\n2\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\nE HkeVeeL\n2.0\n\n\u03a3DM-n = 2.3\u00d710-41 cm2\n\n6\n4\n2\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n8\n\n\u03a3DM-n = 1.8\u00d710-41 cm2\n\n6\n\nmDM =10 GeV\n\n0\n\n3.0\n\nCounts kg-1 day-1 keVee-1\n\nCounts kg-1 day-1 keVee-1\n\n3\n\n2.5\n\nE HkeVeeL\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\nmDM =10 GeV\n\u03a3DM-n = 1.4\u00d710-41 cm2\n\n6\n4\n2\n0\n\n3.0\n\n1.5\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\nE HkeVeeL\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\nSurface Event Correction Factor\n\nFIG. 1: In the upper-left frame, we show the raw spectrum of nuclear recoil candidate events as observed by CoGeNT, as\noriginally presented in Ref.

A dark matter particle with a mass of approximately 10-20 GeV and an elastic scattering cross section\nwith nucleons of approximately (1 \u2212 3) \u00d7 10\u221241 cm2 can account for the excess events reported by each of these experiments.\n\nevent correction factor, we find that the resulting spectrum can be explained by an elastically scattering dark\nmatter particle, although with slightly differing ranges\nof masses and cross sections. In each frame, we show\nan example of a good fit, with the dashed line denoting\nthe signal from the dark matter alone and the solid line\nalso including a flat background from Compton scattering events, in each case correcting for the detector efficiency, as described in Ref. [2].\nIn Fig. 3 we plot the regions of dark matter parameter\nspace that provide a good fit to the efficiency corrected\nspectra shown in Fig. 1. In each case, we have allowed\nthe normalization of the flat background to float. As\nexpected, the inclusion of the non-rejected surface event\nbackground shifts the preferred region towards smaller\ncross sections, as there is now less dark matter signal then\nexpected previously. The range of dark matter masses\nfavored also shifts upward somewhat as a result of the\nadditional surface event background.\nB.\n\nCRESST's Event Spectrum\n\nThe CRESST-II collaboration makes use of eight 300\ngram cryogenic CaWO4 detectors, operating in Italy's\nLaboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso. Due to the relatively light oxygen and calcium nuclei in their target,\nCRESST is quite sensitive to dark matter particles in\nthe mass range favored by CoGeNT. CRESST observes\nevents through both scintillation and heat (phonons),\nenabling them to discriminate nuclear recoil candidate\nevents from a variety of backgrounds.\nVery recently, the CRESST-II collaboration released\n\nan analysis of their first 730 kg-days of data, taken over a\nperiod between 2009 and 2011 [4]. The analysis identified\n67 low-energy nuclear recoil candidate events, which is at\nleast 30% more than can be accounted for with known\nbackgrounds. The CRESST-II collaboration has assessed\nthe statistical significance of this excess to be greater\nthan 4\u03c3.\nThe CRESST-II analysis identified two distinct regions\nof dark matter parameter space which are compatible\nwith the observed excess (see Fig. 3). In the high mass\nregion (referred to as M1), the majority of the excess\nevents arise from dark matter recoils with tungsten nuclei. Within the low mass (M2) region, in contrast, the\nexcess events are dominated by recoils on both oxygen\nand calcium. In an independent analysis based on the\npublicly available portions of the CRESST data, Ref. [14]\nidentified a similar, but somewhat larger, region of compatible dark matter parameter space.\nAs can be seen in Fig. 3, the dark matter parameter\nspace favored by CRESST-II is compatible with the region implied by CoGeNT's spectrum, after correcting for\nsurface event contamination. In particular, a dark matter\nparticle with a mass of roughly 10-20 GeV and an elastic\nscattering cross section with nucleons of (1 \u2212 3) \u00d7 10\u221241\ncm2 could account for the excess events reported by both\ncollaborations.\nC.\n\nConstraints From Other Experiments\n\nA number of direct detection experiments have produced constraints which are relevant to the interpretation\nof the events reported by CoGeNT and CRESST-II.

We have subtracted the flat (Compton scattering) component\nfrom CoGeNT's spectrum, and corrected for CoGeNT's efficiency. The solid curve represents the prediction for a 10 GeV dark\nmatter particle with an elastic scattering cross section of \u03c3n = 1.8 \u00d7 10\u221241 cm2 . The spectrum observed by the combination of\nall of CDMS's detectors is in good agreement with that observed by CoGeNT, although the spectrum from the single detector,\nT1Z5, is slightly lower than CoGeNT's below 1.2 keVee.\n\nparticular, the impact of the constraints presented by the\nCDMS-II, XENON-100, and XENON-10 collaborations\nare significant for the regions of low-mass dark matter\nparameter space favored by CoGeNT and CRESST-II.\nThe CDMS-II collaboration has presented the results\nof two analyses searching for dark matter particles in\nthe mass range collectively favored by CoGeNT and\nCRESST [15, 16]. Before taking into account the updated estimates of CoGeNT's surface event rejection efficiency, these constraints appeared to be in conflict with\na dark matter interpretation of CoGeNT's excess (see,\nhowever, Ref. [17]). As both CDMS and CoGeNT make\nuse of germanium detectors, and thus are sensitive to similar systematic factors such as quenching factors for lowenergy nuclear recoils, it was generally considered difficult to reconcile CDMS's constraints with a dark matter\ninterpretation of CoGeNT. In light of the CoGeNT collaboration recent estimate for their surface event rejection efficiency, however, this apparent conflict seems to\nbe largely resolved. In Fig. 4, we compare the spectrum\nat CoGeNT (after subtracting the flat, Compton scattering, component, and applying the central estimate for the\nsurface event correction factor) to that reported by the\nlow-threshold analysis of CDMS-II. While the spectrum\nbelow 1.2 keVee from CDMS's T1Z5 detector is slightly\nlower than that observed by CoGeNT, the all-detectors\nspectrum reported by CDMS is in good agreement with\nCoGeNT's.\nThe XENON-100 [18] and XENON-10 [19] collaborations have also each reported rather strong constraints\non the parameter space of low-mass dark matter particles. As presented, these constraints appear to largely\nrule out the dark matter parameter space collectively\nfavored by CoGeNT and CRESST. There are a number of ways, however, in which these constraints could\nbe significantly weaker than they might appear. Firstly,\n\nany uncertainties in the response of liquid xenon to very\nlow-energy nuclear recoils (as encapsulated in the functions Leff and/or Qy ) could significantly impact the corresponding constraints for dark matter particles with a\nmass in the range of interest. The constraints from the\nXENON-100 collaboration were derived using measurements of the scintillation efficiency, Leff , as described in\nRefs. [20], which have been criticized in Ref. [21] (see also\nRef. [22]). Even modest changes to these values at the\nlowest measured energies (\u223c3-4 keV) can lead to much\nweaker constraints on light dark matter particles. It has\nalso been argued that the relatively large (9.3 eV) bandgap of xenon is expected to lead to a suppression of the\nresponse to nuclear recoils in the energy range of interest (see Ref. [22] and references therein). Many of these\nissues also apply to constraints on light dark matter making use of only the ionization signal in liquid xenon detectors [19].\nAlternatively, the constraints from XENON-100 and\nXENON-10 could be modified if dark matter particles\ndo not have identical couplings to protons and neutrons [23, 24]. In particular, for a ratio of couplings given\nby fn /fp \u2248 \u22120.7, the constraint from xenon-based experiments is weakened by a factor of \u223c20 relative to that\nfound in the fn = fp case [24]. For this ratio of couplings,\nthe cross section favored by CRESST-II would also be\nmoved down by a factor of \u223c7 relative to that observed\nby CoGeNT. Alternatively, a ratio of fn /fp \u2248 \u22120.6 would\nreduce the strength of the XENON-100 and XENON-10\nconstraints by a factor of 3-4, while also lowering the\nCRESST-II region (relative to that of CoGeNT) by a\nsimilar factor.\nLastly, we note that a constraint has also been placed\nby making use of the CRESST commissioning run\ndata [25]. These results appear to be in mild tension\nwith the upper range (in cross section) of the parame-\n\n\f6\nter space reported to be favored by the analysis of the\nCRESST-II collaboration.\n\nIII.\n\nANNUAL MODULATION\n\nIf a population of events observed in a detector are in\nfact the result of elastically scattering dark matter particles, then we should expect the Earth's motion around\nthe Sun to induce a degree of seasonal variation in the\nrate of those events. For most commonly assumed velocity distributions of dark matter particles, the rate is\npredicted to follow a roughly sinusoidal behavior, with\na peak that occurs within several weeks of late May or\nearly June [26].\nThe CoGeNT and DAMA/LIBRA collaborations have\neach reported the observation of annual modulation of\ntheir event rates. In this section, we characterize and\ncompare the modulation signals reported by these collaborations, and discuss whether these signals could be\nthe result of dark matter.\n\nA.\n\nDAMA/LIBRA's Modulation\n\nThe DAMA/LIBRA experiment makes use of a large\nmass detector (242.5 kg in its current form) consisting\nof high purity NaI(Tl) crystals, located at Gran Sasso.\nDAMA/LIBRA observes nuclear recoil events as scintillation, and is designed to search for time variations in\ntheir event rate, rather than to identify individual dark\nmatter candidate events.\nBased on the data collected over a period of 13 annual cycles, the DAMA/LIBRA collaboration reports evidence of an annual modulation with a statistical significance of 8.9\u03c3. The variation of their rate is consistent\nwith a sinusoid peaking at May 16\u00b17 days at energies\nbetween 2 and 4 keV, May 22\u00b17 days between 2 and 5\nkeV, and May 26\u00b17 days between 2 and 6 keV, consistent with that predicted for dark matter with a roughly\nMaxwellian velocity distribution.\nWhile DAMA/LIBRA's strategy of looking for an annual modulation in their rate can be successfully used to\nseparate a dark matter signal from many possible backgrounds, one might worry about sources of background\nwhich could also exhibit seasonal variation. For example, the underground muon flux is known to modulate\nas a result of temperature variations in the stratosphere\n(although with a later phase and lower rate than is observed by DAMA/LIBRA [29]). Observed variations in\nthe radon-induced background rate are also out-of-phase\nwith the signal reported by DAMA/LIBRA. To date, no\nbackground has been identified with a phase, spectrum\nand rate compatible with DAMA/LIBRA's signal.\nThe regions of dark matter parameter space in which\nthe DAMA/LIBRA modulation can be accounted for\ndepends strongly on the highly uncertain low-energy\nsodium quenching factor (the fraction of recoil energy\n\nof an elastic scattering event which is manifest as scintillation). In their analysis, the DAMA/LIBRA collaboration has adopted a canonical value of QNa = 0.3 \u00b1 0.01\nfor this quantity, which they report to be the measured\nvalue averaged over the recoil energy range of 6.5 to 97\nkeV [30]. Other groups have reported similar values:\nQNa = 0.25 \u00b1 0.03 (over 20-80 keV), 0.275 \u00b1 0.018 (over\n4-252 keV), and 0.4 \u00b1 0.2 (over 5-100 keV) [31]. As the\nsodium quenching factor is generally anticipated to vary\nas a function of energy, it is very plausible that over the\nrange of recoil energies relevant for light (5-20 GeV) dark\nmatter particles (approximately 5 to 30 keV) the quenching factor could be quite different from the average values\nreported from these measurements. For recoil energies\nbelow approximately 20 keV, Ref. [32] reports a measurement of QNa = 0.33 \u00b1 0.15, whereas Ref. [33] reports\na somewhat smaller value of QNa = 0.252 \u00b1 0.064 near 10\nkeV. The results of a very recent and preliminary measurement favor values of QNa \u2248 0.15\u22120.2 at similarly low\nenergies [13, 34]. At this time, we choose to keep an open\nmind regarding the relevant low-energy quenching factor\nfor sodium, and will consider a range of values between\nQNa \u223c 0.15 and 0.40. Based on theoretical considerations [35, 36] and recently experimental evidence [13], we\ndo not consider the possibility that channeling plays an\nimportant role at DAMA/LIBRA.\nFor a quenching factor of QNa \u2248 0.25 (0.15, 0.4), elastically scattering dark matter with a mass in the range\nof approximately 8-19 GeV (12-19 GeV, 6-14 GeV) can\naccommodate the spectrum of the modulation amplitude reported by DAMA/LIBRA (see Fig. 5), assuming\na Maxwellian velocity distribution with typical parameters (for earlier fits of DAMA data to light dark matter\nparticles, see Refs. [37, 38]). The allowed regions do not\nextend to masses above about 18-20 GeV, where scattering with iodine nuclei begins to dominate. Under these\nsame assumptions, an elastic scattering cross section of\n\u03c3n \u2248 (0.7 \u2212 3) \u00d7 10\u221240 cm2 is required to produce the observed magnitude of DAMA/LIBRA's modulation, which\nis significantly larger than the cross section implied by the\nspectra reported by CoGeNT and CRESST. Departures\nfrom a Maxwellian velocity distribution, however, could\nstrongly impact (and potentially enhance) the observed\nmodulation amplitude. We will return to this issue in\nSec. IV A.\n\nB.\n\nCoGeNT's Modulation\n\nThe CoGeNT collaboration has also reported evidence\nof an annual modulation in their event rate, although\nwith a modest statistical significance of 2.8\u03c3. Despite the\nlower statistical significance of this signal, it is interesting\nto compare the features of CoGeNT's time variation with\nthat observed by DAMA/LIBRA. The peak of CoGeNT's\nphase is May 18\u00b116 days, which is slightly earlier (at the\n1.6\u03c3 level) than that favored by DAMA/LIBRA.

[27]. The comparison is done for a dark matter masses of\n10 and 15 GeV, and for three choices of the low-energy sodium quenching factor. The blue (red) error bars denote the CoGeNT\nmodulation amplitude assuming a phase that peaks on April 18th (May 26th). The grey error bars denote the DAMA/LIBRA\nmodulation spectrum. In normalizing the results, we have assumed the dark matter's elastic scattering cross section to scale\nwith the square of the target's atomic number, A2 .\n\nGeNT both arise from dark matter, a common phase that\npeaks in early May seems most likely [5], in concordance\nwith expectations for dark matter based on results from\nnumerical simulations [7].\nIn comparing the spectra of the modulation amplitudes\n\nreported by DAMA/LIBRA and CoGeNT, it is possible\nto remove the dependence on the dark matter's velocity\ndistribution, following the approach of Ref. [27] (see also\nRef. [28]). In Fig. 6, we present such a comparison. Although this comparison does not depend on the velocity\n\n\f8\ndistribution of the dark matter particles, it does rely on\nassumptions pertaining to the mass of the dark matter\nparticle, on the ratio of the elastic scattering cross sections with germanium and sodium, and on the relevant\nquenching factors. Based on the shape of the CoGeNT\nand CRESST-II event spectra, we choose here to consider\nmasses of 10 and 15 GeV, and assume a cross section\nwhich scales with A2 of the target nucleus, as predicted\nfor generic spin-independent scattering. In each of the\nthree frames, we show the results for a different value of\nthe low-energy sodium quenching factor. The spectrum\nof CoGeNT's modulation amplitude was determined using the (publically available) 15 month CoGeNT data\nset [3], as described in Ref. [5].\nFrom Fig. 6, it is immediately evident that the spectrum and overall normalization of the modulation amplitudes reported by CoGeNT and DAMA/LIBRA are\nquite similar. In fact, if the modulation reported by\nDAMA/LIBRA is the product of spin-independent elastic scattering with dark matter, then one should expect CoGeNT to observe a modulation with broad features very much like that they report, and vice versa.\nThe details of this comparison, however, depend significantly on the value of the low-energy sodium quenching factor that is adopted. For a larger value (QNa \u2248\n0.3 \u2212 0.4) the steadily increasing modulation amplitude\nat low energies is seen by both experiments, while CoGeNT's high modulation bin at \u223c2.5 keVee is not confirmed by DAMA/LIBRA. As this feature is apparent\nonly in one bin with a sizable error bar, we consider\nit possible that this bin represents a statistical fluctuation which may disappear with further data from CoGeNT. Alternatively, if a lower sodium quenching factor\nis adopted (QNa \u2248 0.15\u22120.2, as favored by Ref. [13, 34]),\nthe modulation reported by DAMA/LIBRA can overlap\nwith CoGeNT's 2.5 keVee bin, while CoGeNT's lower\nenergy modulation falls below the energy threshold of\nDAMA/LIBRA. In this case, one could consider the possibility that this narrow feature results from a velocity of\nstream of dark matter present in the local halo.\n\nIV.\n\nWHY IS THE OBSERVED MODULATION\nAMPLITUDE SO LARGE?\n\nIn the previous sections, we found that the event\nspectra observed by CoGeNT and CRESST-II are compatible with arising from the same dark matter particle. Similarly, the modulation amplitudes reported by\nDAMA/LIBRA and CoGeNT appear to be mutually consistent. Under the standard assumptions of a Maxwellian\nvelocity distribution and velocity-independent scattering\ncross sections, however, the spectrum and rate of events\nreported by CoGeNT and CRESST-II would lead one to\nexpect a signficantly smaller (by a factor of 3\u201310) modulation amplitude than is observed by DAMA/LIBRA and\nCoGeNT. In this section, we discuss how departures from\nthese assumptions could explain why DAMA/LIBRA\n\nand CoGeNT have observed more modulation than would\nbe naively predicted.\n\nA.\n\nStreams and Other Non-Maxwellian Velocity\nDistributions\n\nNumerical simulations of the formation and evolution of Milky Way-like dark matter halos have become\nincreasingly sophisticated in recent years. These simulations find that although simple halo models with\nMaxwellian distributed velocities are likely to represent\na reasonable zeroth order description of the distribution\nof dark matter in our galaxy, significant departures from\nsuch models are to be expected [39].\nWhen considering relatively light dark matter particles, as we are in this paper, the behavior of the velocity\ndistribution near the escape velocity of the galaxy is of\nparticular importance. In order to produce a measurable\nnuclear recoil, a low-mass dark matter particles requires\ngreater speeds than would be necessary for a heavier particle. As a result, a detector may only be sensitive to the\nhigh velocity tails of the dark matter distribution, where\ndepartures from Maxwellian behavior are expected to be\nmost significant [8].\nSmall-scale structure of the Milky Way's halo can also\nplay an important role in interpreting signals from direct detection experiments. The dark matter halo of our\ngalaxy formed through a sequence of mergers of many\nsmaller halos; a process known as hierarchial structure\nformation. High resolution simulations have found that\nmany smaller halos survive this process and remain intact today, residing as substructures within larger halos [40]. Furthermore, many of these subhalos have a\ngreat deal of their outer mass stripped, resulting in the\nformation of cold tidal streams. The presence of such\nstreams in or around the Solar System would introduce\ndepartures from the Maxwellian velocity distributions.\nWhile such streams could potentially effect the spectrum\nof dark matter-induced events that are observed in direct detection experiments [41], these effects are often\nfar more pronounced in the modulation signals of such\nexperiments [7]. The presence of such streams can significantly enhance a modulation signal, as well as shift\nthe phase of the modulation relative to that predicted in\nmore simple halo models [6, 7].\nIn Fig. 7, we show examples of how streams might impact the spectrum of the modulation amplitude, as observed by CoGeNT. In the left frame, the results from\na simple Maxwellian distribution are shown, for a dark\nmatter mass of 10 GeV and an elastic scattering cross section of \u03c3n = 3 \u00d7 10\u221241 cm2 . As previously emphasized,\nthe overall normalization of the predicted modulation is\na factor of a few smaller than is observed. In the central\nframe, we add an additional tidal stream of dark matter, with a velocity of 475 km/s, a local density of 0.072\nGeV/cm3 (24% of the density of the smooth halo), and a\ndispersion of 15 km/s.

In the center frame, we add a tidal stream of dark matter, with a velocity of 475 km/s, a local density of 0.072 GeV/cm3\n(24% of the density of the smooth halo), and a dispersion of 15 km/s. The characteristics of this stream were chosen to explain\nCoGeNT's rather high error bar at 2.5 keVee (and, for the appropriate choice of the sodium quenching factor, the peak in the\nDAMA/LIBRA spectrum as well; see the upper right frame of Fig. 6). In the right frame, we add a second stream, with a\nvelocity of 165 km/s, a local density of 0.045 GeV/cm3 (15% of the density of the smooth halo), and a dispersion of 15 km/s.\n\nwere chosen to explain CoGeNT's rather high error bar at\n2.5 keVee (and, for the appropriate choice of the sodium\nquenching factor, the peak in the DAMA/LIBRA spectrum as well; see the upper right frame of Fig. 6). In the\nright frame, we add a second stream, with a velocity of\n165 km/s, a local density of 0.045 GeV/cm3 (15% of the\ndensity of the smooth halo), and a dispersion of 15 km/s.\nGiven the presently limited resolution of numerical\nsimulations, it is difficult to assess the probability of significant tidal streams being present in our local neighborhood. Relatively small streams many order of magnitude below the length scales that can be currently resolved could be very important. As an approximate lower\nlimit, we note that current simulations [40] find significant streams to be present at our location of the Milky\nWay in roughly a few percent of realizations [7].\n\nB.\n\nVelocity-Dependent Dark Matter Scattering\n\nIf the dark matter's scattering cross section with nuclei increases with the velocity of the dark matter particle, the degree of seasonal variation in the observed rate\ncan be larger than is predicted in the standard (velocityindependent) case. Inelastic dark matter scenarios are a\nwell known example of models in which the dark matter possesses velocity-dependent cross sections. In such\nmodels, the dark matter can only scatter with nuclei by\nbeing excited into a slightly heavier (typically on the order of 100 keV) state [42]. This requirement suppresses\nthe rate of low energy events, and can increase the degree\nof annual modulation.\nInelastic dark matter, however, does not appear help\nin reconciling the spectra observed by CoGeNT and\nCRESST-II with the modulation of DAMA/LIBRA and\nCoGeNT. In particular, the spectrum of events from inelastically scattering dark matter is predicted to be quite\nflat at low energies, unlike that observed by CoGeNT and\nCRESST-II.\n\nOther models which introduce a velocity dependent\nscattering cross section include form factor dark matter [43] and resonant dark matter models [44] (see also\nRefs. [45, 46]). Each of these classes of models hold\npromise for potentially explaining the large degree of\nmodulation observed by DAMA/LIBRA and CoGeNT.\nIn the first case, a new form factor is introduced which\ninduces a momentum dependence in the interaction between dark matter and nuclei, enhancing the cross section for higher velocity dark matter particles. While this\nfeature can boost the observed modulation amplitude, it\nwill also distort the spectrum of events. In the case of\nresonant dark matter, the interaction cross section is significantly enhanced near a particular center-of-mass energy, leading to large (and potentially narrow in energy)\nmodulation amplitudes.\nAs the CoGeNT collaboration collects more data,\nthe spectrum of the modulation amplitude will become\nrapidly better measured, making it possible to begin to\ndiscriminate between the various options described in\nthis section. By the summer of 2012, CoGeNT will have\ndoubled the size of its data set, and with less background\ncontamination from L-shell electron capture peaks than\nwas present in earlier data. In addition, the CoGeNT\ncollaboration plans to deploy the first of four CoGeNT-4\n(C4) detectors in early 2012, roughly quadrupling their\neffective target mass. If streams or resonances are responsible for a significant fracton of the observed modulation,\nthese features will become increasingly apparent as this\ndata set grows.\nV.\n\nSUMMARY AND DISCUSSION\n\nIn this article, we have compared the signals reported\nby the DAMA/LIBRA, CoGeNT, and CRESST-II collaborations. We summarize our finding as follows:\n\u2022 The spectra of events reported by CoGeNT and\nCRESST-II are in good agreement, and (for a typi-\n\n\fBIBLIOGRAPHY\ncal Maxwellian velocity distribution) are consistent\nwith a dark matter particle with a mass of approximately 10-20 GeV and an elastic scattering cross\nsection of \u03c3n \u2248 (1 \u2212 3) \u00d7 10\u221241 cm2 . This range\nof parameter space is roughly consistent with the\nconstraints from CDMS-II, but is in tension with\nthe constraints of xenon-based experiments unless\nthe response of liquid xenon to very low-energy nuclear recoils is lower than previously claimed, or the\ndark matter's couplings to protons and neutrons\ndestructively interfere for a xenon target.\n\u2022 The spectra of the modulation amplitudes reported\nby DAMA/LIBRA and CoGeNT are also consistent\nwith each other. Under the assumption of a typical\nMaxwellian velocity distribution, these modulation\nsignals favor dark matter particles with masses of\n8-19 GeV and an elastic scattering cross section of\n\u03c3n \u2248 (0.7 \u2212 3) \u00d7 10\u221240 cm2 .\n\u2022 The apparent mismatch between the elastic scattering cross sections required to produce the event\nspectra observed by CoGeNT and CRESST-II and\nthose needed to produced the modulations reported\nby DAMA/LIBRA and CoGeNT could be potentially resolved if the local dark matter distribution\ncontains streams or other highly non-Maxwellian\nfeatures, or if the dark matter's scattering cross\nsection with nuclei is velocity-dependent.\nTaken together, these data appear to favor a dark matter particle with a mass of approximately 10-15 GeV,\nand an elastic scattering cross section of roughly \u03c3n \u223c\n2 \u00d7 10\u221241 cm2 . This mass range is of particular interest\nin light of recent indirect detection results. In particular, the spatial morphology and spectrum of gamma-rays\nobserved from the Galactic Center can be explained by\nthe annihilations of a 7-12 GeV dark matter particle,\nannihilating primarily to leptons, and with an annihilation cross section approximately equal to the value required to generate the observed cosmological abundance\nof dark matter in the early Universe (\u03c3v \u223c 3 \u00d7 10\u221226\ncm3 /s) [47, 48]. The same dark matter model (mass, annihilation cross section, annihilation channels, and halo\nprofile) has also been shown to lead to the production of a\ndiffuse haze of synchrotron emission consistent with that\nobserved by WMAP [49]. It also appears that the excess radio emission observed at higher galactic longitudes\nby the ARCADE 2 experiment [50] possesses a spectral\nshape and overall intensity consistent with originating\nfrom dark matter with the same mass, cross section, dominant channels, and distribution [51, 52]. Lastly, we mention that \u223c10 GeV dark matter particles with the same\ndistribution and annihilation cross section would be capable of depositing the required energetic electrons into the\nMilky Way's non-thermal radio filaments [53], providing\nan explanation for their peculiar spectral features. Comparing these results to the CRESST-II, CoGeNT, and\nDAMA/LIBRA signals discussed in this paper, it may\n\n10\nbe the case that these experiments are each observing\ndifferent facets of the same species of dark matter.\nAcknowledgements: While in the final stages of this\nproject, Ref.
