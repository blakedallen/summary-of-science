Introduction: two problems about Fano threefolds of\ndegree 10\nThere are 17 families of smooth Fano threefolds with Picard number\n1: the projective space P3 , the smooth quadric Q \u2282 P4 , the five families\nYd , d \u2208 {1, . . . , 5} of Fano threefolds of index 2 and degree d, and the\n10 families X2g\u22122 , g \u2208 {2, 3, . . . , 10, 12} of Fano threefolds of index 1\nand degree 2g \u2212 2 (see table in [IsP], \u00a712.2). We will denote by Yd a\nFano threefold belonging to the family Yd , and by X2g\u22122 a member of\nX2g\u22122 .\nAny threefold from the 8 families P3 , Q, Y4 , Y5 , X12 , X16 , X18 , and\nX22 is rational.\nFor threefolds X from the remaining 9 families Y1 , Y2 (quartic double\nsolids), Y3 (cubics), and X2g\u22122 , g \u2208 {2, . . . , 6, 8}, there has been two\napproaches to proving or disproving rationality:\n\u2022 studying the group Bir(X) of birational automorphisms of X.\nThis group is known for X2 , X4 , X6 , and Y1 ([Is2], [G]);\n\u2022 studying the intermediate Jacobian J(X) of X. This principally\npolarized abelian variety has been well-studied for Y2 , Y3 , and\nX8 . In particular, the Torelli theorem holds ([ClG], [V], [D]).\nOne important outcome is that any X from the above 7 families is\nnot rational: in the first case because Bir(X) differs from the Cremona\ngroup Bir(P3 ), and in the second case because J(X) is not a product\nof Jacobians of curves.\nThe two remaining families are X14 and X10 .\nIt was known to Fano that any X14 is birational to a smooth cubic\nthreefold Y3 . In particular, no X14 is rational ([B], Theorem 5.6 (i)).\nMoreover, this implies that the 5-dimensional intermediate Jacobians\nJ(X14 ) and J(Y3 ) are isomorphic. Together with the Torelli theorem for\ncubic threefolds, this implies that the set of all X14 that are birational\nto a given cubic Y3 is an irreducible fivefold birational to J(Y3 ) and\nthat this set is the fiber through [X14 ] of the period map X14 \u2192 A5\n([IMr]).\nMany geometrical properties of X10 were discovered in 1982 by Logachev (see [L], posted 22 years later), but neither is the group Bir(X10 )\nknown, nor has the intermediate Jacobian J(X10 ) been studied.\nAs noticed by Tyurin, the Fano threefold X10 shares certain properties with the quartic double solid Y2 . In particular, their intermediate\nJacobians are both 10-dimensional.1 Thinking that the situation would\n1Unknown\n\nto Tyurin at the time, there are also numerical coincidences between\nthe invariants of the so-called Fano surface F (Y2 ) of lines on Y2 (computed by\n\n\fPRIME FANO THREEFOLDS OF DEGREE 10\n\n3\n\nbe analogous to the correspondences between X14 and Y3 described\nabove, Tyurin stated the following ([T], p. 739).\nConjecture (Tyurin, 1979). The general Fano threefold X10 is birational to a quartic double solid.\nWe give a negative answer to this conjecture (Corollary 7.6).\nVery little is known about the group Bir(X10 ) ([Is3], Problem 4 (b)).\nAs far as we know, the only approach was initiated in the 80's by\nKhashin: in the short note [K], he describes birational involutions\nof X10 (associated with points, twisted cubics, and elliptic quartics\ncontained in X10 ). Given a line l \u2282 X10 (resp. a conic c \u2282 X10 ),\nhe also constructs a birational isomorphism \u03c8l : X10 99K Xl (resp.\n\u03c8c : X10 99K Xc ), where Xl (resp. Xc ) is also in X10 (see \u00a76.2 and\n\u00a76.1).2\nSince Xl and Xc have the same intermediate Jacobian as X10 , the\nmatter of deciding whether they are isomorphic is of great interest\nfor the Torelli problem. However, this problem remained unsolved for\nyears ([IsP], Problem 11.4.2 (ii)).\nProblem (Khashin, 1986). Are Xl and Xc isomorphic to X10 ?\nWe also give a negative answer to this problem, by proving that in\ngeneral, neither Xl , nor Xc , is isomorphic to X10 .\nBoth answers are consequences of our study of the period map \u2118 :\nX10 \u2192 A10 . We show (Theorem 6.4) that the set of all conic transforms\nXc , as c varies in the Fano surface F (X10 ) of conics contained in X10 ,\nforms a connected component of the fiber of \u2118 through [X10 ] which is\nbirationally isomorphic to the quotient of F (X10 ) by a geometrically\nmeaningful involution \u03b9.\nOn the other hand, consider points of X10 corresponding to general\nline transforms Xl . Their conic transforms form another 2-dimensional\ncomponent of the fiber of \u2118 over [J(X10 )] which is birationally isomorphic to the quotient by a geometrically meaningful involution of the\nmoduli space MX (2; 1, 5) of stable rank-2 torsion-free sheaves on X10\nWelters in [W]), and those of (the minimal model of) the Fano surface F (X10 ) of\nconics on X10 (computed by Logachev in [L]): they both satisfy pg = 101, q = 10,\nc21 = 720, and c2 = 384. This coincidences stem from the fact that a general Y2 is\nisomorphic to a singular X10 (see Proposition 7.4).\n2Khashin also stated without proof that the existence of a birational isomorphism\nf between X10 and any other Fano threefold Y of index one, should imply that Y\nis also in X10 , and that f is a composition of birational isomorphisms of the five\ntypes described above.\n\n\f4\n\nO.

Although the study of certain degenerations of elements of X10 provide strong evidence for this conjecture,\nour lack of knowledge about the properness of \u2118 makes it very difficult\nto obtain more information about it at the moment.\n\n2.

Automorphisms of W . Any automorphism of W is induced by\nan automorphism of P(V5 ) that maps the conic cU onto itself ([PV],\nTheorem 1.2).

Let Aut+ (W ) \u2282\nGL(V5 ) be the pull-back of Aut(W ) \u2282 PGL(V5 ). As we saw in \u00a73.2,\nany \u03c6 \u2208 Aut+ (W ) must preserve U3 , so it decomposes as\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03c62 0\n,\n\u03c6=\n\u03c60 \u03c63\nand the projection \u03c6 7\u2192 \u03c62 induces the map Aut(W ) \u2192 Aut(cU ) in (2).\nIt also needs to preserve V8 \u2282 \u22272 V5 , and this implies that \u03c63 must be a\nnonzero multiple of Sym2 t \u03c62 , the map induced by \u03c62 on U3 = Sym2 U2\u2228 ;\nthis nonzero multiple gives the C\u2217 -factor in the sequence above.\nThe C4 -factor corresponds to the case where \u03c62 and \u03c63 are the identity, in which case \u03c60 \u2208 Hom(U2 , U3 ) = Hom(U2 , Sym2 U2\u2228 ) must be\nsuch that\n\u2200u, v \u2208 U2 \u03c60 (u)(v, *) = \u03c60 (v)(u, *).\nThis is equivalent to the condition that \u03c60 be completely symmetric, that is, belong to the image of the natural map Sym3 U2\u2228 \u2192\nHom(U2 , Sym2 U2\u2228 ). In particular, the C4 -factor in the sequence above\nis a copy of Sym3 U2\u2228 as an SL(2, C)-module.\nFinally, the group Aut(W ) acts on W with four orbits ([PV], Proposition 6.8):\n\u2022 O1 = c\u2228U \u2282 \u03a0,\n\u2228\n\u2022 O2 = \u03a0\nS cU ,\n\u2022 O3 = V4 \u2208LU \u03a0V4 \u03a0,\n\u2022 O4 = W O3 ,\n4\n\nThis is indeed a surface since Pic(W ) is generated by OW (1), hence all threefolds in W have degree divisible by 5.\n\n\f8\n\nO.

Once we have chosen, as in \u00a73.2, a decomposition V5 = U2 \u2295 U3 , with U3 = Sym2 U2\u2228 , we get an induced action of\nGL(2, C) on W .\nProposition 3.1. The smooth fourfold W is a compactification of the\naffine homogeneous space GL(2, C)/S3.\nProof. If x is a general point in W \u2282 G(2, V5 ), the corresponding subspace in V5 maps isomorphically to U2 , and is therefore the graph of a\nmap gx : U2 \u2192 U3 . The map y 7\u2192 gx (y)(y) is a general cubic form on\nU2 , and the stabilizer of x in GL(2, C) must preserve the zeroes of this\ncubic form, hence be equal to the symmetric group S3 .\n\u0003\nAs a consequence, W is rational. For the proof of Logachev's reconstruction theorem 9.1, we will need a precise description of an explicit birational isomorphism with P4 . Recall that W sits in P(V8 ) =\nP(U1 \u2295 U3 \u2295 U4 ).\nProposition 3.2. The projection from P(U3 ) defines a birational isomorphism \u03ba : W 99K P(U1 \u2295 U4 ). The inverse \u03ba\u22121 is defined by\nthe linear system of quadrics containing a rational normal cubic curve\n\u039303 \u2282 P(U4 ) \u2282 P(U1 \u2295 U4 ).\nProof. A point in G(2, V5 ) corresponds to a tensor of the form\n(u + P ) \u2227 (v + Q) = u \u2227 v + u \u2297 Q \u2212 v \u2297 P + P \u2227 Q,\nwith u and v in U2 , and P and Q in U3 \u2243 Sym2 U2\u2228 . It belongs to W if\nand only if Q(u, *) = P (v, *) as linear forms on U2 . We must prove that\nthe projection sending this tensor to u \u2227 v + u \u2297 Q \u2212 v \u2297 P is generically\ninjective. This follows from the fact there there is a natural map\nSym2 U4 \u0592\u2192 Sym2 (U2 \u2297 U3 ) \u2192 \u22272 U2 \u2297 \u22272 U3 \u2243 U3 ,\nsending (u \u2297 Q)(v \u2297 P ) to (u \u2227 v)(P \u2227 Q), from which we can get the\ncomponent P \u2227 Q back.\nMoreover, this shows that the inverse map is defined by the space of\nquadrics orthogonal to the kernel of this morphism in Sym2 (U1 \u2295 U4 )\u2228 ,\nand these are precisely the quadrics containing the rational normal\ncubic curve \u039303 image of P(U2\u2228 ) in P(U4 ) = P(Sym3 U2\u2228 ).\n\u0003\nThe rational map \u03ba is not defined along the 2-plane \u03a0, whose total\nimage is the hyperplane P(U4 ). More precisely, through any point x in\n\u03a0, there are two (possibly equal) lines tangent to c\u2228U , which meet this\nconic at (possibly equal) points x1 and x2 , and the total image of x by\n\u03ba is the line lx bisecant (or tangent) to \u039303 through x1 and x2 .\n\n\fPRIME FANO THREEFOLDS OF DEGREE 10\n\n9\n\nIf a hyperplane V4 \u2282 V5 does not contain U3 , the quadric surface\nQW,V4 (see (1)) meets \u03a0 at the unique point [U3 \u2229 V4 ], so the restriction\nof \u03ba to QW,V4 sends it to a 2-plane in P(U1 \u2295 U4 ). If V4 does contain\nU3 , that is, if V4 = V1\u22a5 for some line V1 \u2282 U2 defining a point in cU , the\nlinear span of QW,V4 is mapped to the tangent line to the corresponding\npoint of \u039303 .\n3.7.

The acyclicity of \u03a91G (\u2212r) for r \u2208 {3, 4} yields\nH 4(W, \u03a91G (\u22123)|W ) \u2243 H 6 (G, \u03a91G (\u22125)),\nwhich is Serre-dual to H 0 (G, TG ) \u2243 sl(V5 ).

Gushel and Mukai proved\nthat it is of one of the following types described below ([Gu], \u00a74; [IsP],\nCorollary 4.1.13 and Theorem 5.1.1).\nLet V5 be a 5-dimensional vector space. Consider the Grassmannian\nG(2, V5) \u2282 P(\u22272 V5 ) in its Pl\u00fccker embedding and denote by Pm a\nlinear subspace of P(\u22272 V5 ) of dimension m.

They depend on 22 parameters (see \u00a74.4), whereas Gushel\nthreefolds depend on only 19 parameters.\n4.2. The moduli space MX (2; 1, 4). Let us recall how the embedding\nof X into G(2, V5) was obtained by Gushel and Mukai. There exists on\nX a smooth elliptic quartic curve \u039314 whose linear span is 3-dimensional\n([IsP], Lemma 5.1.2). Serre's construction yields a rank-2 vector bundle\nE on X with a section vanishing exactly on \u039314 fitting into an extension\n0 \u2192 OX \u2192 E \u2192 I\u039314 (1) \u2192 0.\nWe have c1 (E ) = [OX (1)] and c2 (E ) = [\u039314 ]. Moreover, h0 (X, E ) = 5,\nH i (X, E ) = 0 for i > 0, and H i (X, E \u2228 ) = 0 for i \u2265 0. In particular H 0 (X, E \u2228 ) = H 0 (X, E (\u22121)) = 0, so E is stable since Pic(X) =\nZ[OX (1)]. By [IsP], Lemma 5.1.3, E is globally generated and defines a morphism of X into G(2, H 0(X, E )\u2228 ) = G(2, V5) such that E\n\u2228\nis the restriction to X of the dual tautological rank-2 bundle S2,V\non\n5\n6\nG(2, V5).\nProposition 4.1. Let X be any smooth Fano threefold of type X10 .\nThe vector bundle E is the unique stable rank-2 vector bundle on X\nwith Chern numbers c1 (E ) = 1 and c2 (E ) = 4.\nProof. We follow [M]. Let F be a vector bundle on X with the same\nproperties as E . Let H = H om(E , F ). A general hyperplane section\nS of X is a K3 surface, and again Pic(S) = Z[OS (1)].\nThe restriction H |S has Chern numbers c1 (H |S ) = 0 and c2 (H |S ) =\n4c2 (E |S ) \u2212 c1 (E |S )2 = 6. So by the Riemann-Roch theorem,\n1\n\u03c7(S, H |S ) = 4\u03c7(OS ) + (c1 (H |S )2 \u2212 2c2 (H |S )) = 2.\n2\n0\nIn particular h (S, H om(E |S , F |S )) or h0 (S, H om(F |S , E |S )) must\nbe nonzero. Since E |S and F |S are stable bundles with the same\nslope, this implies that they are isomorphic.\nWe want to prove that any isomorphism between E |S and F |S extends to X, by showing H 1 (X, H (\u22121)) = 0. We prove by descending\n5Intersect,\n\nin P10 , a cone over G(2, V5 ) with a quadric and a P7 ; if the P7 does\nnot pass through the vertex of the cone, we are in the first case; if it does, we are\nin the second case.

So the\ndimension we are interested in is controlled by the dimension of the\neigenspaces of \u03c6\u2217 . To estimate the dimensions of these eigenspaces,\n\n\fPRIME FANO THREEFOLDS OF DEGREE 10\n\n13\n\nwe may by semicontinuity assume that the image of \u03c6 in PGL(2, C)\n(see (2)) is the identity. The eigenvalues of \u03c6 on V5 are then 1, with\nmultiplicity 2, and some \u03b6 \u22121 with multiplicity 3. The eigenvalues of \u03c6\u2217\non Sym2 V8\u2228 are thus 1, \u03b6, \u03b6 2 , \u03b6 3 , \u03b6 4 , with respective multiplicities 1,\n4, 13, 12, and 6. These eigenvalues can coincide for certain values of \u03b6,\nbut it is easy to check that for \u03b6 6= 1, no eigenspace can have dimension\n> 20. So the maximal number of parameters for Q is\n20 + h0 (P7 , IW (2)) = 25 < 36 \u2212 7.\nSuppose now \u03b6 = 1.

The most natural way to define an moduli \"space\" for\nFano varieties of type X100 would be as the quotient of an open subset\nof |OW (2))| by the action of Aut(W ). However, the latter group being\nnonreductive, the question of whether this quotient is a scheme is difficult to settle. On the other hand, it is not difficult to construct this\nsame \"space\" as the quotient of a quasi-projective variety by the action\nof the (reductive) group SL(V5 ), but again, it is not clear whether this\nsubset corresponds to (semi)stable points for some polarization, or even\nthat the action is proper. We hope to come back to this interesting\nquestion in the future, but for the time being, we will just consider the\nalgebraic stack N10 of Fano threefolds of type X100 . It is an algebraic,\nsmooth, irreducible stack of dimension\ndim |OW (2))| \u2212 dim(Aut(W )) = 30 \u2212 8 = 22.\nThis will be sufficient for our purposes. Locally around a point corresponding to a threefold X, this stack is given by the local Kuranishi\n\n\f14\n\nO. DEBARRE, A. ILIEV, AND L. MANIVEL\n\nspace of X, a smooth 22-dimensional variety, acted on by the finite\ngroup Aut(X). We denote by \u2118 : N10 \u2192 A10 the period map.\n5. The varieties of conics contained in X\nMost of the material in this section is due to Logachev ([L]).\n5.1. The surfaces Fg (X) and F (X). Let X be a Fano threefold of\ntype X100 . Let Fg (X) be the variety of (possibly nonreduced or reducible) conics contained in X. It follows from deformation theory and\n[IsP], Proposition 4.2.5.(iii), that Fg (X) has dimension 2 everywhere.\nAs seen in \u00a73.1, any conic c in G(2, V5) is contained in some G(2, V4),\nwhere the hyperplane V4 \u2282 V5 is uniquely determined by c unless hci\nis a \u03b2-plane. It is therefore natural to introduce the incidence variety\nF (X) = {(c, [V4 ]) \u2208 Fg (X) \u00d7 P(V5\u2228 ) | c \u2282 G(2, V4)}.\nThe first projection p1 : F (X) \u2192 Fg (X) is an isomorphism except over\nthe point [cX ] that corresponds to the \u03c1-conic \u03a0 \u2229 \u03a9, where the fiber\nL\u03c1 is isomorphic to the line LU via the second projection p2 : F (X) \u2192\nP(V5\u2228 ). The conic cX is the only \u03c1-conic on X.\nFor any [V4 ] in LU , the intersection \u03a0V4 \u2229 \u03a9 is a \u03c3-conic in X. These\nconics describe a curve L\u03c3 \u2282 F (X) isomorphic to LU via p2 . These are\nthe only \u03c3-conics on X.\nIf c is a conic contained in X, its span hci is a 2-plane such that\nhci \u2229 X = c.7\nIf (c, V4 ) is a \u03c3-conic, the intersection \u03a0 \u2229 \u03a0V4 is a line in \u03a0 tangent\nto the conic c\u2228U . In general, it meets cX in the two points of cX \u2229 c.\nThrough any of these two points passes one other tangent to c\u2228U , hence\nc meets exactly two other \u03c3-conics, at points of cX . In particular, two\ngeneral \u03c3-conics are disjoint. Also, there are two \u03c3-conics through a\ngeneral point of cX .\nAny point of a \u03c3-conic (c, V4 ) corresponds to a line in P(V4 ), which\nmust meet P(U3 ). Therefore, the union of all \u03c3-conics in X is contained\nin its section with the hyperplane {V2 \u2282 V5 | V2 \u2229 U3 6= {0}}. This\nsection being irreducible, they are equal.\n5.2. The involution \u03b9 on F (X). Let V4 \u2282 V5 be a hyperplane. In\nthe 3-plane P(MV4 ) = P(\u22272 V4 ) \u2229 P7 introduced in \u00a73.4, let us define\nthe quadric\nQ\u03a9,V4 = \u03a9 \u2229 P(MV4 )\n7This\n\nquadrics.\n\nis because X contains no 2-planes (footnote 8) and is an intersection of\n\n\fPRIME FANO THREEFOLDS OF DEGREE 10\n\n15\n\nand set (see (1))\n(13)\n\n\u039314,V4 = X \u2229 P(MV4 ) = QW,V4 \u2229 Q\u03a9,V4 ,\n\nwhich is a genus-1 degree-4 1-cycle.8 We have\n(c, V4 ) \u2208 F (X) \u21d0\u21d2 c \u2282 \u039314,V4 .\nAssume now that X is general. Easy parameters counts (see [L],\nLemma 3.7) then show that the residual curve is another conic \u03b9(c) \u2282 X\nthat meets c in two points. This defines a fixed-point-free involution \u03b9\non F (X) and the quotient F\u03b9 (X) = F (X)/\u03b9 maps injectively to P(V5\u2228 )\nby the projection p2 .\nFor any [V4 ] in LU , the quadric QW,V4 is already reducible (see \u00a73.4),\nhence LU \u2282 p2 (F (X)). Moreover, p\u22121\n2 ([V4 ]) has exactly two points,\nwhich correspond to the conics \u03a0 \u2229 \u03a9 and \u03a0V4 \u2229 \u03a9. We have p\u22121\n2 (LU ) =\nL\u03c1 \u2294 L\u03c3 and \u03b9(L\u03c1 ) = L\u03c3 .\nHere is a characterization of the involution \u03b9.\nLemma 5.1. Let c and c\u2032 be two conics on a general X of type X10 ,\nwith no common component. If dim(hc, c\u2032 i) = 3 and deg(c * c\u2032 ) = 2, we\nhave c\u2032 = \u03b9(c).\nProof. If hci is contained in W , the line hci \u2229 hc\u2032i and the conic c\u2032 are in\nW \u2229hc\u2032 i. The line is not contained in c\u2032 (because X \u2229hci = c) hence W ,\nwhich is an intersection of quadrics, contains hc\u2032 i. One of the conics is\nthen cX and the other is a \u03c3-conic so we are done.\nSince W is an intersection of quadrics, if it contains neither planes\nhci and hc\u2032 i, it does not contain the line hci \u2229 hc\u2032 i. Any point z on\nthe line hci \u2229 hc\u2032 i but not on c \u222a c\u2032 is not on G(2, V5 ). We may write\nx = v1 \u2227 v2 , y = v3 \u2227 v4 , and z = v1 \u2227 v2 + v3 \u2227 v4 . The vectors v1 , . . . , v4\nspan a hyperplane V4 \u2282 V5 and every bisecant line to G(2, V5) passing\nthrough z is contained in P(\u22272 V4 ). It follows that P(MV4 ) contains c\nand c\u2032 , hence c\u2032 = \u03b9(c).\n\u0003\nRemark 5.2. One checks, by a case-by-case analysis, that the involution \u03b9 can still be defined on F (X) for any smooth X. It can however\nhave fixed points. More precisely, for a smooth conic c \u2282 X, the following conditions are equivalent:\n(i) \u03b9(c) = c;\n(ii) c is a \u03c4 -conic with normal bundle Nc/X \u2243 O(2) \u2295 O(\u22122);\n(iii) there is a P3 \u2282 P7 such that X \u2229 P3 = 2c (this generalizes\nLemma 5.1).\n8Since\n\nPic(X) is generated by OX (1), all surfaces in X have degree divisible by\n10, hence \u039314,V4 is a curve.\n\n\f16\n\nO. DEBARRE, A. ILIEV, AND L. MANIVEL\n\nHere is a quick proof. If (i) holds, we have X \u2229 P(MV4 ) = 2c, hence\n(iii) holds. If (iii) holds, the conic c \u2282 P3 is the intersection of a double\nplane and a quadric Q. With the notation of \u00a76.1, the normal direction\nto c in Q at each point of c corresponds to a curve in the exceptional\ndivisor E which is contracted by the projection from c, hence Nc/X\nmust be O(2) \u2295 O(\u22122), and (ii) holds. Finally, if (c, V4 ) is a \u03c4 -conic,\nNc/W \u2243 O(2) \u2295 O(1) \u2295 O(1). In particular, the O(2)-factor is uniquely\ndetermined, and it is the image of Nc/QW,V4 . If (ii) holds, the O(2)-factor\nof Nc/X must map to Nc/QW,V4 , hence the induced morphism Nc/QW,V4 \u2192\nNX/W must be zero. This means that the quadric \u03a9 vanishes to order\n2 on c, hence (i) holds.\nThese conics correspond to singular points of the surface F (X).\n5.3. Logachev's tangent bundle theorem. Assume again that X is\ngeneral. Logachev shows that F (X) and Fg (X) are smooth connected\nsurfaces ([L], Corollary 4.2). The map p1 : F (X) \u2192 Fg (X) is the\ncontraction of the exceptional curve L\u03c1 to [cX ]. The curve L\u03c3 = \u03b9(L\u03c1 )\nis therefore also exceptional. Let Fg (X) \u2192 Fm (X) be its contraction\nand let r : F (X) \u2192 Fm (X) be the composition.\nLet \u03b2 : F (X) \u2192 G(2, V8) be the map that sends a conic c to the\nprojective line hc \u2229 \u03b9(c)i, and let S2,V8 be the tautological bundle on\nG(2, V8). On the open set F (X)0 = F (X) (L\u03c1 \u2294 L\u03c3 ), there is an\nisomorphism ([L], Theorem 4.14)\n\u223c\n\u2217\nTF (X)0 \u2212\u2192(\u03b2\nS2,V8 )|F (X)0 .\n\nThis \"tangent bundle theorem\" has the following geometric interpretation ([L], Theorem 7.2): in the diagram\n\u03c8\nP(TFm (X) ) _ _ _/ P(H 0 (Fm (X), \u03a9Fm (X) )\u2228 ) \u2243 P9\n\n\u001f\n\u001f\n\n\u03c0\n\n\u000f\n\nFm (X)\n\n\u001f\u000f\n\n\u03c0\u2032\n\nP7\n\nwhere \u03c8 is the cotangent map and \u03c0 \u2032 is the projection from the line\n\u03c8(\u03c0 \u22121 ([cX ])), the composition \u03c0 \u2032 \u25e6 \u03c8 sends a general fiber \u03c0 \u22121 ([c]) =\nP(TFm (X),[c] ) to the line hc \u2229 \u03b9(c)i in P7 .\nCorollary 5.3. The only rational curves in F (X) are L\u03c1 and L\u03c3 . In\nparticular, the surface Fm (X) is minimal.\n\u2228\nSince S2,V\nis generated by global sections on G(2, V8 ), so is \u03a9Fm (X) ,\n8\nexcept possibly at the points [cX ] and \u03b9([cX ]). We will show later\n(Corollary 6.3) that it is in fact globally generated everywhere.\n\n\fPRIME FANO THREEFOLDS OF DEGREE 10\n\n17\n\nRemark 5.4. For any X of type X100 , the scheme F (X) is still an irreducible surface (Corollary 8.3) which may have singular points (Remark\n5.2).\nNote that the Fano surface of a Gushel threefold (see \u00a74.1) has two\ncomponents ([I], Proposition (2.1.2)).\n6. Elementary transformations\n6.1. Elementary transformation along a conic. Let c be a smooth\nconic contained in a Fano threefold X of type X100 and let \u03c0c : P7 99K\ne \u2192 X is the blow-up\nP4 be the projection from the 2-plane hci.

It follows from\nLemma 5.1 that the only conic contracted by \u03c0c is \u03b9(c), hence the\nmorphism \u03c6|\u2212KXe | contracts only finitely many curves.9 Let\n\u03c6\ne \u2212\u2192\n\u03c6|\u2212KXe | : X\nX\u0304 \u2212\u2192 P4\n\nbe its Stein factorization. The variety X\u0304 has terminal hypersurface\nsingularities, \u2212KX\u0304 is ample, and \u03c6\u2217 KX\u0304 = KXe . The divisor \u2212E is \u03c6antiample.

Let X be a general Fano threefold of type X10 and\nlet c be a smooth \u03c4 -conic on X. There is a birational isomorphism\n\u03c6c : Fg (X) 99K Fg (X \u2032 )\nwhich commutes with the (rational) involutions \u03b9 on Fg (X) and \u03b9\u2032 on\nFg (X \u2032 ). Its inverse is \u03c6c\u2032 .\nProof. Let c\u0304 be a conic in X disjoint from c. The span hc, c\u0304i is a 5-plane\nthat intersects X \u2282 P7 along a canonically embedded genus-6 curve\nc + c\u0304 + \u0393c,c\u0304 , where \u0393c,c\u0304 is a sextic. Since X \u2229 hci = c, this implies that\n\u0393c,c\u0304 meets c in four points, and similarly for c\u0304.\nWe now show that on X general, for general conics c and c\u0304, the\nsextic \u0393c,c\u0304 is smooth and irreducible. Note to that effect that S =\n10If\n\ne of a line in X that meets c, we have (3\u03b5\u2217 H \u2212\nl is the strict transform in X\n4E) * l = \u22121 hence l is in the base locus of |\u03c7\u2217 \u03b5\u2032 \u2217 H \u2032 |. Similarly, the strict transform\ne of the conic \u03b9(c) has intersection \u22122 with 3\u03b5\u2217 H \u2212 4E, hence is also in the base\nin X\ne show that the base ideal\nlocus of |\u03c7\u2217 \u03b5\u2032 \u2217 H \u2032 |.

If h is the class of a general\nline in the plane, the embedding S \u2192 hc, c\u0304i is given by the linear system\n|3h \u2212 E1 \u2212 * * * \u2212 E4 |. The family of conics in S is the union of the five\npencils |h \u2212 Ei |, for i \u2208 {1, . . . , 4}, and |2h \u2212 E1 \u2212 * * * \u2212 E4 |. Since c\nand c\u0304 are disjoint, they must belong to the same pencil, say |h \u2212 E1 | or\n|2h \u2212 E1 \u2212 * * * \u2212 E4 |. The curve c + c\u0304 + \u0393c,c\u0304 is the intersection of S with\na general quadric containing c and c\u0304. It follows that \u0393c,c\u0304 is a general\nmember of the linear systems |4h \u2212 2E2 \u2212 * * * \u2212 2E4 | or |2h|, which are\nboth base-point-free. In particular, \u0393c,c\u0304 is a smooth rational curve of\ndegree 6.\nThe rational map \u03c8c is defined on \u0393c,c\u0304 by a linear subsystem of\n|Ic4 (3)|, of degree \u2264 3 deg(\u0393c,c\u0304 ) \u2212 4c * \u0393c,c\u0304 = 2. For c\u0304 general, its image\non X \u2032 is therefore a conic. This defines, for X and c general, a rational\nmap\n\u03c6c : Fg (X) 99K Fg (X \u2032 ).\nAlternatively, a case-by-case analysis using footnote 10 shows that\nfor any smooth \u03c4 -conic c, the curve \u03c8c (\u0393c,c\u0304 ) is a conic as soon as c\u0304 and\n\u03b9(c\u0304) are \u03c4 -conics that meet none of the lines that meet c or \u03b9(c). This\nimplies that the map \u03c6c is still defined in this case.\nThe composition \u03c0hci = \u03c6 \u25e6 \u03b5\u22121 : X 99K P4 is the projection from the\n2-plane hci, hence \u03c0hc\u2032 i = \u03c6\u2032 \u25e6 \u03b5\u2032 \u22121 : X \u2032 99K P4 is the projection from\nthe 2-plane hc\u2032 i. It follows that the curve \u03c8c (c + c\u0304 + \u0393c,c\u0304 ) in X \u2032 lies in\n\u22121\nthe 5-plane \u03c0hc\n\u2032 i (\u03c0hci (hc, c\u0304i)). It contains the conic \u03c8c (\u0393c,c\u0304 ), the sextic\n\u2032\n\u03c8c (c ), and the conic c\u2032 . Thus, the rational map \u03c6c\u2032 : Fg (X \u2032 ) 99K Fg (X)\nis the inverse of \u03c6c , which is therefore birational.\nThe section of the quartic \u03c0c (X) \u2282 P4 by the 2-plane \u03c0c (hc, c\u0304i) is\nthe union of the conics \u03c0c (c\u0304) and \u03c0c (\u0393c,c\u0304 ). Similarly, its section by the\n2-plane \u03c0c (hc, \u03b9(c\u0304)i) is the union of the conics \u03c0c (\u03b9(c\u0304)) and \u03c0c (\u0393c,\u03b9(c\u0304) ).\nSince c\u0304 and \u03b9(c\u0304) together span a 3-plane, these two 2-planes meet along\na line that meets \u03c0c (X) in four points, including the two points of\n\u03c0c (c\u0304)\u2229\u03c0c (\u03b9(c\u0304)). It follows that the intersection of the conics \u03c0c (\u0393c,c\u0304) and\n\u03c0c (\u0393c,\u03b9(c\u0304) ) with this line must be the same. In particular, these conics\nmeet in two points, hence so do their images \u03c6c ([c\u0304]) and \u03c6c (\u03b9([c\u0304])) in\nX \u2032 .

MANIVEL\n\n\u2022 the point \u03b9([c]) to [cX \u2032 ];\nand factors as\n\u223c\nFg (X) \u2212\u2192 Fm (X) \u2212\u2192\nFm (X \u2032 ) \u2190\u2212 Fg (X \u2032 )\n\nIn other words, the surface Fg (X \u2032 ) is isomorphic to the surface Fm (X)\nblown up at the point [c].\nProof. We can assume that c is general. Let c\u0304 be a general \u03c3-conic on\nX. We have\nX \u2229 hc, c\u0304i = c + c\u0304 + \u0393c,c\u0304,\nwhere \u0393c,c\u0304 is a smooth irreducible sextic. To show \u03c8c (\u0393c,c\u0304 ) = c\u2032 , since\n\u03c7\u2217 E \u2032 * \u0393c,c\u0304 = (\u22122\u03b5\u2217 KX \u2212 3E) * \u0393c,c\u0304 = 0,\nit is enough to show that (the strict transform of) \u0393c,c\u0304 meets the divisor\n\u03c7\u2217 E \u2032 , because it will then have to be contained in it.\nRecall that c meets exactly two \u03c3-conics, say c1 and c2 . Since c1 meets\nc in one point, \u03b9(c) in one point, is not contained in the indeterminacy\nlocus of \u03c8c , and has degree \u22122 \u2212 4 + 3 \u00d7 2 = 0 on the linear system\n2\n|I\u03b9(c)\n\u2297Ic4 (3)| that defines \u03c8c (see footnote 10), it maps to a point of c\u2032\ne \u2032 . It is therefore\non X \u2032 , hence to a fiber of the map \u03b5|E \u2032 : E \u2032 \u2192 c\u2032 on X\nenough to show that \u0393c,c\u0304 meets c1 outside of c.\nNote that c1 and c2 both meet both c, and they both meet cX in two\npoints. They are therefore contained in hc, cX i, and the sextic \u0393c,cX is\nthe union of c1 , c2 , and a conic that meets c1 and c2 each in one point,\nand c in two points, hence must be \u03b9(c).\nThe 1-cycle\n\u0393 = (c + c\u0304 + \u0393c,c\u0304) + (c + cX + \u0393c,cX )\n= 2c + c\u0304 + \u0393c,c\u0304 + cX + c1 + c2 + \u03b9(c)\nis the complete intersection in P7 of X with the hyperplane hc, c\u0304, cX i\nand the reducible quadric hc, c\u0304i \u222a hc, cX i, hence \u03c9\u0393 = O\u0393(2). In particular, c1 must meet the other components in six points. Since it meets\ncX twice, c and \u03b9(c) simply, and neither c\u0304 nor c2 , it must meet \u0393c,c\u0304 .\nWe have therefore shown that \u03c6c is defined at general points of the\ncurve L\u03c3 \u2282 F (X) of \u03c3-conics in X, and that its value at these points\nis the point [c\u2032 ] \u2208 F (X \u2032 ). Since \u03c6c commutes with \u03b9, it is also defined\nat [cX ], where it takes the value \u03b9\u2032 ([c\u2032 ]).\nThe rest of the statements follows from the symmetry \u03c6\u22121\n= \u03c6c \u2032\nc\nand the facts that \u03c6c commutes with the involutions and the surfaces\nFm (X) and Fm (X \u2032 ) are of general type (Corollary 5.3).\n\u0003\nCorollary 6.3. If X is a general Fano threefold of type X10 , the sheaf\n\u03a9Fm (X) is generated by its global sections.\n\n\fPRIME FANO THREEFOLDS OF DEGREE 10\n\n21\n\nProof. We saw in \u00a75.3 that \u03a9Fm (X) is generated by global sections,\nexcept possibly at [cX ] and \u03b9([cX ]). Because of Proposition 6.2, this\nholds everywhere.\n\u0003\nWe will now write Xc instead of X \u2032 to highlight the dependence on\nc. For X general, as [c] varies in the open subset of F (X) consisting\nof smooth \u03c4 -conics, the assignment [c] 7\u2192 [Xc ] defines a rational map\nFg (X) 99K N10 .\nTheorem 6.4. Let X be a general Fano threefold of type X10 . For\nany conic c \u2282 X, one can define a smooth birational model Xc of X\nsuch that Fg (Xc ) is isomorphic to the surface Fm (X) blown up at the\npoint [c]. The assignment [c] 7\u2192 [Xc ] defines an injective morphism\nFm,\u03b9 (X) \u2192 N10 whose image is a proper surface contained in a fiber of\nthe period map \u2118 : N10 \u2192 A10 .\nWe will see in Remark 7.2 that this morphism actually induces an\nisomorphism from Fm,\u03b9 (X) onto a connected component of the fiber of\nthe period map.\nProof. The idea is to prove that for a general conic d \u2282 X, the conic\n\u03c6d (c) = \u03c8d (\u0393d,c ) \u2282 Xd\nis a smooth \u03c4 -conic. We can then set\nXc = (Xd )\u03c6d (c) .\nNote that we define the variety Xc , but not a particular birational map\nX 99K Xc . According to Proposition 6.2, the surface F (Xc ) is then\nisomorphic to the surface Fm (X) blown-up at the point [c]. By the\nReconstruction Theorem 9.1, the isomorphism class of the variety Xc\nis independent of the choice of d. This procedure therefore defines, for\neach general X, a morphism Fg (X) \u2192 N10 which, since all \u03c3-conics\nhave the same images in Fm (X), factors through Fm (X).\nIf c is a \u03c3-conic (resp. the \u03c1-conic), we established during the proof\nof Proposition 6.2 that \u03c8d (\u0393d,c ) is the smooth \u03c4 -conic d\u2032 (resp. \u03b9\u2032 (d\u2032 )).\nSo we may assume that c = l \u222a l\u2032 is a reducible \u03c4 -conic. We proceed\nby contradiction, assuming that the conic \u03c8d (\u0393d,c ) \u2282 Xd is reducible.\nThe degree-6 1-cycle \u0393d,c must then split as the sum of two degree-3\n1-cycles \u0393 and \u0393\u2032 , each of which meets d in two points.\nWe assume that d is a general \u03c4 -conic; more precisely, that neither\nd nor \u03b9(d) meets c, \u03b9(c), or any of the (finitely many) lines contained\nin X that meet c. Furthermore, if we write (see \u00a73.1)\n(15) l = {[V2 ] | he1 i \u2282 V2 \u2282 V3 } and l\u2032 = {[V2 ] | he\u20321 i \u2282 V2 \u2282 V3\u2032 },\n\n\f22\n\nO. DEBARRE, A. ILIEV, AND L. MANIVEL\n\nwe assume that the unique hyperplane V4d \u2282 V5 such that d \u2282 G(2, V4d )\n(see \u00a75.1) contains neither e1 nor e\u20321 . Note that since c is a \u03c4 -conic,\nwe have l \u2229 l\u2032 = {e1 \u2227 e\u20321 } and V4c = V3 + V3\u2032 . We assume that the\n2-planes P(V3 ) and P(V3\u2032 ) each meet the smooth quadric surface Qd \u2282\nP(V5) swept out by the lines corresponding to points of d (see \u00a73.1)\ntransversely in two points, and no two of these four points are on a\nline contained in Qd .\nStep 1. The curve \u0393 is irreducible and meets each of the lines l and l\u2032\nin one point.\nIf \u0393 is reducible, it contains a line m. If m meets l (or l\u2032 ), we have\nby assumption m \u2229 d = \u2205, hence the residual conic must meet m, and\nd in two points: it is therefore \u03b9(d), which is absurd since we assumed\nm \u2229 \u03b9(d) = \u2205. If \u0393 is reducible, it must therefore contain a smooth\nconic meeting l and l\u2032 , and this conic is \u03b9(c). The residual line must\nthen meet d in two points, which again contradicts our assumptions.\nIt follows that \u0393 is irreducible. Since a cubic curve contained in X\ncannot be bisecant to a line contained in X (because the corresponding\nline transform would contract the cubic and this would contradict [IsP],\nProposition 4.3.1; see \u00a76.2), \u0393 meets each of the lines l and l\u2032 in one\npoint.\nStep 2. There exists a line P(W2 ) \u2282 P(V5 ) that meets all lines parametrized by \u0393. It is contained in P(V4d ) but not in the quadric Qd .\nThe restriction to \u0393 of the tautological subbundle S2,V5 is isomorphic\nto O(\u22121) \u2295 O(\u22122), or to O \u2295 O(\u22123). In the latter case, all lines\nparametrized by \u0393 pass through a fixed point. But this cannot happen\nsince, d being a \u03c4 -conic, the lines in P(V5) corresponding to the two\npoints of \u0393 \u2229 d are disjoint. We are therefore in the first case, hence\n\u0393 can be parametrized by \u03b3 : t 7\u2192 [w(t) \u2227 v(t)], where w is linear\nin t, and v is quadratic in t. Take for W2 \u2282 V5 the 2-dimensional\nvector space spanned by the w(t). More precisely, we may assume\n\u0393 \u2229 d = {\u03b3(0), \u03b3(\u221e)} and\n\u03b3(t) = [(w0 + tw\u221e ) \u2227 (v0 + tv1 + t2 v\u221e )],\nwith W2 = hw0 , w\u221e i and V4d = hw0 , w\u221e , v0 , v\u221e i. We may further\nassume \u0393 \u2229 l = {\u03b3(1)} and \u0393 \u2229 l\u2032 = {\u03b3(t0 )} for some t0 \u2208\n/ {0, 1, \u221e}.\nSet\n(16)\n\nw = w0 + w\u221e\n\nand w \u2032 = w0 + t0 w\u221e ,\n\nso that W2 = hw, w \u2032i. Since we assumed e1 \u2208\n/ V4d , we have e1 \u2208\n/ W2 ,\nhence \u03b3(1) = [e1 \u2227w]. Similarly, \u03b3(t0 ) = [e\u20321 \u2227w \u2032 ]. If P(W2 ) is contained\nin Qd , the point [w] \u2208 P(V5 ) must be one of the two points of P(V3)\u2229Qd ,\nand [w \u2032 ] must be one of the two points of P(V3\u2032 )\u2229Qd . Since we assumed\n\n\fPRIME FANO THREEFOLDS OF DEGREE 10\n\n23\n\nthat none of the four lines joining these points are contained in Qd , this\nis absurd.\nFinally, we have\n(17)\n\nv0 + v1 + v\u221e \u2208 he1 , wi and v0 + t0 v1 + t20 v\u221e \u2208 he\u20321 , w \u2032i,\n\nhence v0 + t0 v\u221e is in the hyperplane he1 , e\u20321 , w, w \u2032i.\nConversely, let us start with [w] \u2208 P(V3 \u2229 V4d ) and [w \u2032 ] \u2208 P(V3\u2032 \u2229 V4d ).\nAssume w \u2208\n/ V3\u2032 and w \u2032 \u2208\n/ V3 , and that the line h[w], [w \u2032]i meets Qd in\ntwo points, [w0 ] and [w\u221e ]. These points determine uniquely the points\n[w0 \u2227 v0 ] and [w\u221e \u2227 v\u221e ] of d, together with the point [e1 \u2227 w] of l, and\nthe point [e\u20321 \u2227 w \u2032 ] of l\u2032 . Note that w0 and w\u221e are defined only up to\nmultiplication by nonzero scalars. But our choice of parametrization\nof \u0393 imposes w0 + w\u221e \u2208 Cw (see (16)), so these scalars must be the\nsame, and w0 + t0 w\u221e \u2208 Cw \u2032 , which determines t0 uniquely.\nAgain, v0 and v\u221e are defined only up to multiplication by nonzero\nscalars and addition of multiples of w0 and w\u221e respectively. But since\nv0 + t0 v\u221e must be in the hyperplane he1 , e\u20321 , w, w \u2032i, these scalars must\nagain be the same. These changes can be achieved by noting that the\nspan of w0 + tw\u221e and v0 + tv1 + t2 v\u221e is also the span of w0 + tw\u221e and\n\u03bbv0 + \u03bcw0 + t(\u03bbv1 + \u03bcw\u221e + \u03bdw0 ) + t2 (\u03bbv\u221e + \u03bdw\u221e ).\nFinally, v1 is uniquely determined by (17), hence the curve \u0393 is\nuniquely determined by the choice of [w] and [w \u2032]. Since both vary\nin a projective line, \u0393 belongs to a two-dimensional (irreducible) family.\nLet us now look at quadrics \u03a9 containing c and d. Containing a\ngiven twisted cubic \u0393 as above imposes three further conditions. Since\n\u0393 varies in a two-dimensional family, a general quadric containing d\nand c contains no such cubic \u0393. This implies what we need.\nFinally, we will show in Theorem 9.1 that the conic transforms Xc\nand Xd are isomorphic if and only if there exists an automorphism \u03c3\nof Fm (X) such that \u03c3([c]) = [d]. By Corollary 9.3, \u03c3 is either trivial or\n\u03b9, so this proves the last statement of the theorem.\n\u0003\n6.2. Elementary transformation along a line.

The differential of the period map \u2118 : N10 \u2192 A10 at the\npoint defined by X is the map\nd\u2118 : H 1(X, TX ) \u2192 Hom(H 1,2 (X), H 2,1(X))\ndefined by the natural pairing H 1 (X, TX ) \u2297 H 1 (X, \u03a92X ) \u2192 H 2 (X, \u03a91X ).\nWe want to describe the kernel of d\u2118.\nTheorem 7.1. The kernel of d\u2118 is naturally identified with the quotient\nV5 /U3 . In particular \u2118 is smooth and its image has dimension 20.\nProof. Following [F], we use the long exact sequences induced by the\nexact sequences (11) and (12) to get a commutative diagram\n\n(19)\n\nH 1 (X, \u03a92W (1)|X ) \u2297 H 1 (X, \u03a92X ) \u2192 H 2 (X, \u03a91W |X )\n\u2193\nk\n\u2193\n1\n1\n2\n2\nH (X, TX )\n\u2297 H (X, \u03a9X ) \u2192\nH (X, \u03a91X )\n\u2193\nk\n\u2193\n2\n1\n1\n2\n3\nH (X, \u03a9X (\u22121)) \u2297 H (X, \u03a9X ) \u2192 H (X, OX (\u22122)).\n\n\fPRIME FANO THREEFOLDS OF DEGREE 10\n\n25\n\nIf we set G = G(2, V5 ), the kernel of the restriction map\n\u22272 V5\u2228 = H 0 (G, OG (1)) \u2192 H 0 (W, OW (1))\nis V8\u22a5 . From the normal sequences of X in W and W in G, we deduce\nisomorphisms\nH 2 (X, \u03a91W |X ) \u2243 H 3 (W, \u03a91W (\u22122)) \u2243 H 4 (W, V8\u22a5 \u2297 OW (\u22123)) \u2243 V8\u22a5\n(because \u03c9W = OW (\u22123)).

By [F], Lemma 2.9, this follows from\nthe fact that the following diagram commutes up to sign:\nH 2 (X, \u03a91X (\u22121)) \u2297 H 1 (X, \u03a92X ) \u2192 H 3 (X, OX (\u22122))\n\u2193\n\u2191\nk\n3\n0\n3\nH (X, OX (\u22123)) \u2297 H (X, OX (1)) \u2192 H (X, OX (\u22122)).\nIndeed, the last row of this diagram is Serre-dual to the multiplication\nmap H 0 (X, OX (1)) \u2297 H 0 (X, OX (1)) \u2192 H 0 (X, OX (2)); in particular, it\nis nondegenerate with respect to the first factor, and the same conclusion follows for the first row because the map\nH 2 (X, \u03a91X (\u22121)) \u2192 H 3 (X, OX (\u22123))\nis injective. To prove that, we need to check that H 2 (X, \u03a91W (\u22121)|X )\nvanishes. But this follows from the normal sequence of X in W , (5),\nand (3).\nWe can now conclude that the kernel of d\u2118 at [X] is contained in the\nimage of H 1 (X, \u03a92W (1)|X ) in H 1 (X, TX ). We compute the dimension\nof this space. From the normal sequence of X in W , we get an exact\nsequence\nH 1 (W, \u03a92W (\u22121)) \u2192 H 1 (W, \u03a92W (1))\n\u2192 H 1 (X, \u03a92W (1)|X ) \u2192 H 2 (W, \u03a92W (\u22121))\nwhose extreme terms vanish by (5). Moreover, H 1 (W, \u03a92W (1)) is dual\nto H 3 (W, \u03a92W (\u22121)), which is 2-dimensional by (5) again.\nSince we already know that the kernel of d\u2118 has dimension at least 2,\nwe can conclude that this kernel is exactly H 1 (X, \u03a92W (1)|X ). We have\ntherefore proved the theorem.\n\u0003\n\n\f26\n\nO. DEBARRE, A. ILIEV, AND L. MANIVEL\n\nRemark 7.2. Let X be general. Recall from Theorem 6.4 that conic\ntransforms yield an injective morphism from the proper surface Fm,\u03b9 (X)\nto the fiber F of the period map passing through the point corresponding to X. By Theorem 7.1, the image is a smooth surface and a\nconnected component of F . Since Fm,\u03b9 (X) is a minimal surface, this\ncomponent is actually isomorphic to Fm,\u03b9 (X).\nRemark 7.3. Let X be general. Using iterated conic and line transformations, we can construct many threefolds with the same intermediate\nJacobian as X. However, since we know that the fibers of the period\nmap have dimension 2, there must be coincidences that we will know\nexplain.\nWe just saw that the connected component of the fiber F of the\nperiod map passing through the point corresponding to X is a proper\nsurface (isomorphic to) Fm,\u03b9 (X). If l is a line contained in X, we get\nanother component Fm,\u03b9 (Xl ) of F . By continuity, this component is\nindependent of the choice of l (in \u00a78, we will prove directly that these\nsurfaces are abstractly isomorphic). Now take a conic c \u2282 X; by the\nsame reasoning, conic transforms of Xc also land in the component\nFm,\u03b9 (X) of F , whereas line transforms of Xc land in the \"other\" component (note that we have not proved that these two components are\nactually distinct). In other words, conic transformations leave each of\nthe two components above of F invariant, whereas line transformations\nswitch them.\n7.2. Fano threefolds of degree 10 and quartic double solids.\nQuartic double solids are double covers of P3 branched along a smooth\nquartic surface. They have Picard number 1, index 2, and form the\nfamily Y2 described in the introduction. They were extensively studied\nby Clemens in [Cl], who computed, among many other things, that their\nintermediate Jacobian has dimension 10.\nProposition 7.4. A general quartic double solid is birational to a 2dimensional family of nodal Fano threefolds which are degenerations of\n(smooth) Fano threefolds of type X10 .\nProof. This is a construction that can be found in [BrCZ] \u00a74.4.1 and\n[CSP], Example 1.11, to which we refer for the proofs. Let \u03c0 : Y \u2192 P3\nbe a quartic double solid, with involution \u03b9, and let v : Y \u2192 P10 be the\nmorphism defined by the anticanonical linear system | \u2212KY | = |2\u03c0 \u2217 H|.\nChoose any line l \u2282 Y (there is a 2-dimensional family of such lines).\nThe projection of v(Y ) \u2282 P10 99K P7 from the 2-plane spanned by\nthe (conic) image of l is a singular Fano threefold X\u0304 \u2282 P7 , obtained\nas the image of the blow-up \u03b5 : \u1ef8 \u2192 Y of l, with exceptional divisor\n\n\fPRIME FANO THREEFOLDS OF DEGREE 10\n\n27\n\nE, by the morphism \u03c6 associated with the anticanonical linear system\n| \u2212 K\u1ef8 | = |2\u03b5\u2217\u03c0 \u2217 H \u2212 E| (compare with diagram (14)). This morphism\nonly contracts the curve \u03b9(l) and X\u0304 is a singular Fano threefold of\ndegree 10 with one node (from the family (T7 ) of [CSP], Theorem 1.6).\nBy [N], X\u0304 can be deformed into a smooth Fano threefold of degree\n10, whose Picard number is 1 by [JR]; it is therefore of type X10 . \u0003\nKeeping the notation of the proof, lines on Y map to conics on X\u0304.\nThis gives a map F (Y ) 99K F (X\u0304). This explains the coincidences\nbetween the numerical invariants of the minimal surface F (Y ) and\nthose the minimal model of F (X10 ) (see footnote 1).\nCorollary 7.5. The endomorphism ring of the intermediate Jacobian\nof a very general Fano threefold of type X10 is isomorphic to Z.\nProof. By Proposition 7.4, the intermediate Jacobian of a quartic double solid is a degeneration of intermediate Jacobians of Fano threefolds\nof type X10 . By [Cl], Theorem (5.67), intermediate Jacobians of quartic double solids degenerate in turn to semi-abelian varieties which are\nextensions by C\u2217 of Jacobians of complete intersection curves C \u2282 P3\nof bidegree (2, 4), where the extension class \u03b5 is the difference between\nthe two g41 on C ([Cl], end of \u00a77). In general, the endomorphism ring\nof J(C) is trivial ([CivG]) and \u03b5 has infinite order. This proves the\ncorollary.\n\u0003\nCorollary 7.6. A general Fano threefold of type X10 is not birationally\nisomorphic to a smooth quartic double solid.\nProof. Let X be a general Fano threefold of type X10 . It was observed\nby Clemens and Griffiths ([ClG]; see also [IsP], \u00a78.1) that the Griffiths\ncomponent JG (X) (the product of the principally polarized factors of\nJ(X) that are not Jacobians of curves) is a birational invariant of X.\nIt follows from the proof of Corollary 7.5 that J(X) can degenerate to\nthe intermediate Jacobian of a general quartic double solid, whose theta\ndivisor has a singular locus of codimension 5 ([D], th. (8.1)). It follows\nthat the singular locus of the theta divisor of J(X) has codimension\n\u2265 5, and in particular, JG (X) = J(X).\nAssume now that X is birationally isomorphic to a smooth quartic\ndouble solid Y . We then have J(Y ) = JG (Y ) \u2243 JG (X) = J(X).\nBut this is impossible, since the J(X) form a 20-dimensional family\n(Theorem 7.1), whereas quartic double solids form a 19-dimensional\nfamily.\n\u0003\n\n\f28\n\nO. DEBARRE, A. ILIEV, AND L. MANIVEL\n\n8. The moduli space MX (2; 1, 5)\nLet X be any threefold of type X100 . We study the moduli space\nMX (2; 1, 5) of semistable rank-2 torsion-free sheaves on X, with Chern\nnumbers c1 = 1, c2 = 5, and c3 = 0, along the lines of [IM]. A\nnoteworthy difference is that a vector bundle in this moduli space is\nnot necessarily generated by its global sections. Our treatment of the\nnon globally generated bundles is directly inspired by [BraF]. The main\nresult of this section is Theorem 8.2.\nFirst remarks. Let E be a semistable rank-2 vector bundle on X, with\nChern numbers c1 = 1 and c2 = 5. By the Riemann-Roch theorem, we\nhave\n1\n\u03c7(X, E nd(E )) = 4\u03c7(OX ) \u2212 c1 (X)(c1 (E )2 \u2212 4c2 (E )) = \u22121.\n2\nWe claim that E has nonzero sections. Indeed \u03c7(X, E ) = 4 and\n3\nH (X, E ) = 0 by Serre duality. So we just need to prove that H 2 (X, E )\nvanishes, which can be proved as in [IM], Lemma 5.1.\nRestrict E to a general hyperplane section S of X, a K3 surface\nof degree 10 with Pic(S) = Z[OS (1)]. We have \u03c7(S, E |S ) = 4 and\nH 2 (S, E |S ) = H 1 (S, E |\u2228S ) = 0, hence h0 (S, E |S ) \u2265 4. Choosing a\nnonzero section s of E |S , we get an extension\n*s\n\n0 \u2192 OS \u2192 E |S \u2192 IZ (1) \u2192 0,\nwhere Z is a zero-dimensional scheme of length 4. Since E |S is locally\nfree, we have h1 (S, IZ (1)) \u2265 1, and there is in fact equality since\notherwise Z would generate a line contained in S, which is impossible.\nLooking at the associated long exact sequence, we get H 1 (S, E |S ) =\n0, thus h0 (S, E |S ) = 4. Back to X, we obtain H 1 (X, E ) = 0 and\nh0 (X, E ) = 4. Moreover, E is globally generated in codimension two.\nNon locally free sheaves. Let F be a semistable rank-2 torsion-free\nsheaf on X with Chern numbers c1 = 1, c2 = 5, and c3 = 0, which is\nnot locally free. We claim that there exists a unique line l in X such\nthat F fits in an exact sequence\n0 \u2192 F \u2192 TX\u2228 \u2192 Ol \u2192 0.\nThis is the same statement as Proposition 5.11 in [IM] and the proof\nis the same: the bidual G = F \u2228\u2228 is locally free outside a finite set,\nso its restriction to a general K3 section S is locally free, the quotient (G /F )|S has finite support, and length((G /F )|S ) = 5 \u2212 c2 (G |S ).\nMoreover G |S is semistable and the moduli space of simple sheaves on\nS is smooth at G |S , of dimension 4 \u2212 4 length((G /F )|S ). The same arguments as in [IM] yields that the length of (G /F )|S is nonzero, hence\n\n\fPRIME FANO THREEFOLDS OF DEGREE 10\n\n29\n\nmust in fact be 1. This means that G /F is supported on a line l plus\npossibly a finite set of points.\nMoreover G |S , being semistable with Chern numbers c1 = 1 and\nc2 = 4, must be the restriction of TX\u2228 to S. Finally, exactly as in [IM],\nG \u2243 TX\u2228 and G /F \u2243 Ol .\nNon globally generated bundles. Now, let E be a semistable rank-2\nvector bundle on X, with Chern numbers c1 = 1 and c2 = 5, which is\nnot generated by global sections. We follow the arguments of [BraF],\nLemma 6.12. Denote by I \u2282 E the image of the evaluation map\nH 0 (X, E ) \u2297 OX \u2192 E and by K its kernel. Set also T = E /I , a\nnonzero sheaf supported in codimension two. The torsion-free sheaf I\nis stable of rank two, with c1 (I ) = 1 and c2 (I ) \u2265 5. The reflexive\nsheaf K is also stable of rank two, with c1 (K ) = \u22121. By restricting to\na general K3 section and applying Mukai's formula for the dimension of\nthe moduli space, we get c2 (K ) \u2265 4, hence c2 (I ) = 10 \u2212 c2 (K ) \u2264 6.\nSuppose c2 (K ) = 5; then c(T ) = 1+c3 (K ) and, by Riemann-Roch,\nl(T ) = c3 (K )/2 \u2264 0. So T = 0, a contradiction.\nSo c2 (K ) = 4. But the dual sheaf K \u2228 must then be the dual TX\u2228\nof the tautological sheaf. Finally, a computation yields \u03c7(T (k)) = k.\nSince H 0 (X, T ) = 0, this implies T = Ol (\u22121) for some line l in X.\nWe get an exact sequence\n0 \u2192 TX \u2192 H 0 (X, E ) \u2297 OX \u2192 E \u2192 Ol (\u22121) \u2192 0.\nNote that if we apply the functor H om(., OX ), we get the dual sequence\n0 \u2192 E \u2228 \u2192 H 0 (X, E )\u2228 \u2297 OX \u2192 TX\u2228 \u2192 Ol \u2192 0.\nThis means that E \u2228 can be identified with the kernel of the evaluation map H 0 (X, F ) \u2297 OX \u2192 F of the non locally free sheaf [F ] \u2208\nMX (2; 1, 5) defined by l. In particular, E is uniquely defined by l, and\nH 0 (X, E ) \u2243 H 0 (X, F )\u2228 .\nAn involution on the moduli space. Let [E ] \u2208 MX (2; 1, 5) be a globally\ngenerated vector bundle. Observe that the kernel K of the evaluation\nmap H 0 (X, E ) \u2297 OX \u2192 E is a rank-2 vector bundle with c1 = \u22121\nand c2 = 5, with no nonzero global sections. Its dual \u03b9E is therefore\nstable, with Chern numbers c1 (\u03b9E ) = 1 and c2 (\u03b9E ) = 5. Moreover, \u03b9E\nis globally generated and we have a natural identification H 0 (X, \u03b9E ) \u2243\nH 0 (X, E )\u2228 .\nMore precisely, taking global sections in the sequence above, we get\nan exact sequence of vector spaces\n0 \u2192 H 0 (X, E )\u2228 \u2192 H 0 (X, TX\u2228 ) \u2243 V5\u2228 \u2192 V1\u2228 \u2192 0,\n\n\f30\n\nO. DEBARRE, A. ILIEV, AND L. MANIVEL\n\nwhere V1 \u2282 V5 is the \"vertex\" of the line l \u2282 X (\u00a73.1). We can\nthus identify H 0 (X, E ) with V5 /V1 , hence P(H 0(X, E )) with the set\nof V2 \u2282 V5 containing V1 . Geometrically, the codimension-2 Schubert\ncycle \u03c320 (V2 ) \u2282 G(2, V5 ) meets X along a 1-cycle of the form l + \u039315 ,\nwhere \u039315 is an elliptic quintic bisecant to l. This cycle is the zero-locus\nof the section of E defined (up to scalars) by V2 .\nProposition 8.1. Let X be a Fano threefold of type X100 and let l \u2282 X\nbe a line. There is a birational isomorphism\n\u03c6l : MX (2; 1, 5) 99K F (Xl )\nwhich is compatible with the involutions on MX (2; 1, 5) and F (Xl ).\nProof. Let [E ] \u2208 MX (2; 1, 5) be a globally generated vector bundle and\nconsider the exact sequence\n0 \u2192 Il \u2297 E \u2192 E \u2192 E |l \u2243 Ol \u2295 Ol (1) \u2192 0.\nSince every proper subspace of H 0 (l, Ol (1)) has a base-point, and E\nis globally generated, the restriction map H 0 (X, E ) \u2192 H 0 (l, E |l ) is\nsurjective. Hence H 0 (X, Il \u2297 E ) is one-dimensional, generated by s.\nThe zero-locus of s is \u039304 \u222al, where \u039304 is a rational quartic curve bisecant\nto l. The line transform \u03c8l maps \u039304 to a conic on Xl . This defines a\nrational map \u03c6l as required.\nConversely, the inverse image by \u03c8l of a general conic on Xl is a\nrational quartic \u039304 bisecant to l. Applying the Serre construction to\nthe degenerate elliptic quintic \u039304 \u222a l, we obtain a stable vector bundle\nof rank 2 on X with Chern numbers 1 and 5 and a section that vanishes\non \u039304 \u222a l. The map \u03c6l is therefore birational. We know prove that it\nis compatible with the involutions.\nRecall that \u03b9E is dual to the kernel of the evaluation map H 0 (X, E )\u2297\nOX \u2192 E . Let s (resp. s\u2032 ) be a section of E (resp. \u03b9E ) generating\nH 0 (X, Il \u2297 E ) (resp. H 0 (X, Il \u2297 \u03b9E )), and denote its zero-locus by\n\u039304 \u222a l (resp. \u0393\u2032 04 \u222a l). By the definition of \u03b9E , the section s defines\non \u039304 a section \u03c3 of (\u03b9E )\u2228 , and this section does not vanish (since it\ndefines a nonzero section of E |\u039304 ). We get an exact sequence\n0 \u2192 O\u039304 \u2192 (\u03b9E )\u2228 |\u039304 \u2192 L \u2228 \u2192 0,\nwhere L is a line bundle on \u039304 of degree 4. On the other hand, the\npairing (\u03c3, s\u2032 |\u039304 ) \u2208 O\u039304 is identically zero, since s\u2032 vanishes on l, which\nmeets \u039304 . This means that on \u039304 , the section s\u2032 of \u03b9E is in fact a\nsection of L . Therefore s\u2032 must vanish at four points of \u039304 : the two\nintersection points with l, and two other points which must be on \u0393\u2032 04 .\nThus \u039304 and \u0393\u2032 04 meet in two points, hence the corresponding conics\n\n\fPRIME FANO THREEFOLDS OF DEGREE 10\n\n31\n\nc = \u03c8l (\u039304 ) and c\u2032 = \u03c8l (\u0393\u2032 04 ) also meet in two points. By Lemma 5.1,\nthese two conics are in involution.\n\u0003\nTheorem 8.2. Let X be any Fano threefold of type X100 . The moduli\nspace MX (2; 1, 5) of semistable rank-2 torsion-free sheaves on X with\nChern numbers c1 = 1, c2 = 5, and c3 = 0, is a smooth irreducible\nsurface.\nThe non locally free sheaves and the non globally generated vector\nbundles in MX (2; 1, 5) are respectively parametrized by two copies \u0393nf\nand \u0393ng of the curve \u0393(X) of lines in X. These two curves are exchanged by the involution \u03b9 on the moduli space.\nWhen X is general, \u0393(X) is a smooth irreducible curve of genus 71\n([IsP], Theorem 4.2.7).\nProof. First suppose that [E ] \u2208 MX (2; 1, 5) is a globally generated\nvector bundle. A general section of E vanishes along a smooth elliptic\nquintic \u039315 and yields an exact sequence\n0 \u2192 OX \u2192 E \u2192 I\u039315 (1) \u2192 0.\nTwisting by E \u2228 and taking cohomology, we obtain h2 (X, E nd(E )) =\nh2 (X, I\u039315 \u2297 E ) = h1 (\u039315 , E |\u039315 ). By the Atiyah classification, E |\u039315 is\nthe direct sum of two line bundles, both globally generated.\nSuppose that [E ] is not a smooth point of MX (2; 1, 5). We have\nH 1 (\u039315 , E |\u039315 ) 6= 0, and one of these line bundles is trivial: E |\u039315 =\nO\u039315 \u2295 O\u039315 (1). But E |\u039315 is the normal bundle to \u039315 in X. In the normal\nsequence\n0 \u2192\n\nN\u039315 /X\n\u2192 N\u039315 /G(2,V5 ) \u2192 (NX/G(2,V5 ) )|\u039315\n\u2192 0\nk\nk\nk\n0 \u2192 O\u039315 \u2295 O\u039315 (1) \u2192 O\u039315 (1)5 \u2192 O\u039315 (1)2 \u2295 O\u039315 (2) \u2192 0\n\nthe image in N\u039315 /G(2,V5 ) of the factor O\u039315 (1) of N\u039315 /X maps to zero in\n(NX/G(2,V5 ) )|\u039315 , which means that the corresponding linear form defines\na tangent hyperplane to X. This contradicts the smoothness of \u039315 .\nSuppose now that [F ] \u2208 MX (2; 1, 5) is not locally free. We saw that\nF fits into an exact sequence\n0 \u2192 F \u2192 TX\u2228 \u2192 Ol \u2192 0\nfor a unique line l in X. We are thus in the same situation as in [IM],\nProposition 5.12, and the same proof yields Ext2 (F , F ) = 0.\nFinally, suppose that E is locally free but not globally generated.\nWe saw that E fits into an exact sequence\n0 \u2192 E \u2228 \u2192 H 0 (X, F ) \u2297 OX \u2192 F \u2192 0\n\n\f32\n\nO. DEBARRE, A. ILIEV, AND L. MANIVEL\n\nwhere the non locally free sheaf [F ] \u2208 MX (2; 1, 5) is as above. From\nthis sequence we infer\nH 2 (X, E nd(E )) \u2243 H 1 (X, E \u2297 F )\nand\nH 1 (X, E \u2297 F ) \u2243 Ext2 (F , F )\n(apply the functor Hom(*, F ) and use H 1 (X, F ) = H 2 (X, F ) = 0).\nSo by the previous case we obtain the vanishing of H 2 (X, E nd(E )).\nWe can now conclude that MX (2; 1, 5) is a smooth surface. Since\nit is birational to F (Xl ) (Proposition 8.1), it is also irreducible for\nX general. But the vanishing of Ext2 (F , F ), for any point [F ] of\nMX (2; 1, 5), also proves that for any family X \u2192 S of Fano threefolds\nof type X100 , the relative moduli scheme MX (2; 1, 5) \u2192 S is smooth\nover S. In particular, since its general fibers are connected, any fiber\nis connected. This proves that MX (2; 1, 5) is always connected.\nThe involution \u03b9 was defined by mapping a globally generated vector\nbundle E to the globally generated vector bundle \u03b9E defined by the\nexact sequence\n0 \u2192 (\u03b9E )\u2228 \u2192 H 0 (X, E ) \u2297 OX \u2192 E \u2192 0\nIf we replace E by the non locally free sheaf F \u2208 MX (2; 1, 5) defined by\nthe line l, this exact sequence gives for \u03b9F the non globally generated\nvector bundle associated to the same line. This shows that \u03b9 extends to\nthe curve \u0393nf of non locally free sheaves in MX (2; 1, 5), which is mapped\nbijectively to the curve \u0393ng of non globally generated vector bundles.\nBeing an involution, \u03b9 also extends to \u0393ng . We can finally conclude that\n\u03b9 defines a regular involution of the smooth surface MX (2; 1, 5) which\npermutes the curves \u0393nf and \u0393ng .\n\u0003\nCorollary 8.3. Let X be any Fano threefold of type X100 . The surface\nF (X) is irreducible.\nProof. This follows directly from Theorem 8.2, Proposition 8.1, and\nthe fact that X is itself a line transform (\u00a76.2).\n\u0003\n9. The reconstruction theorem\nFollowing Logachev ([L]), we show that a general X10 can be recovered from its Fano surface.\nTheorem 9.1 (Logachev). Let X and X \u2032 be general Fano threefolds of\n\u223c\ntype X10 and let f : Fg (X) \u2192\nFg (X \u2032 ) be an isomorphism.

For any smooth \u03c4 -conic\nc \u2282 X, the threefolds Xc and X\u03b9(c) are isomorphic.\nProof. This follows from Theorem 9.1 and Proposition 6.2.\n\n\u0003\n\nCorollary 9.3. For a general X, the only nontrivial automorphism of\nthe minimal surface Fm (X) is the involution \u03b9.\nProof. The cotangent bundle of Fm (X) is generated by global sections\n(Corollary 6.3) and defines a morphism\nl10 : Fm (X) \u2192 G(2, V10 ),\n0\n\nwhere V10 = H (Fm (X), \u03a9Fm (X) )\u2228 . Since global sections of \u03a91Fm (X)\nare anti-invariant by the involution \u03b9 ([L], Proposition 0.5), l10 factors through the action of \u03b9. Let V8 be the quotient of V10 by the\n2-dimensional vector space l10 ([cX ]).

Any nontrivial automorphism \u03c3 of Fm (X) then acts on the tangent space TJ(X),0 = V10 as\n\u00b1 Id, hence l10 factors through the action of \u03c3. This implies \u03c3 = \u03b9. \u0003\nProof of Theorem 9.1. We will reconstruct X from the abstract surface\nFg (X). The successive steps are the following.\n1) From the abstract surface Fg (X), we first recover the minimal\nsurface Fm (X) with its involution \u03b9. By Corollary 6.3, we also recover\nthe map F\u03b9 (X) \u2192 G(2, V8 ) which, when we will have constructed X,\nwill map a conic c to the line hc \u2229 \u03b9(c)i.\n\n\f34\n\nO. DEBARRE, A.

The problem at that point is that we\ndo not know where to locate W in P(V8 ). Nevertheless, we can reconstruct the rational normal cubic \u039303 in P4 which defines \u03ba\u22121 (Proposition\n3.2).\n4) The map \u03ba\u22121 sends P4 to a copy of W in some P(V8\u2032 ). From\nF\u03b9 (X), we are able to find an identification between P(V8 ) and P(V8\u2032 ).\n5) So we get W inside P(V8 ), and intersecting it with the lines\nparametrized by F\u03b9 (X), we get a surface S whose \"quadratic span\"\nis the Fano threefold X we are looking for.\nStep 1. We know that L\u03c3 and L\u2032\u03c3 are the unique rational curves in\nFg (X) and Fg (X \u2032 ), so f (L\u03c3 ) = L\u2032\u03c3 . Moreover these curves are (\u22121)curves, and contracting them, we get the minimal surfaces Fm (X) and\n\u223c\nFm (X \u2032 ), and an isomorphism f : Fm (X) \u2192\nFm (X \u2032 ) which sends \u03b9([cX ])\n\u2032\nto \u03b9 ([cX \u2032 ]).\nWe keep the notation and results of the proof of Corollary 9.3. We\nhave a commutative diagram\nFm (X)\n\nl10\n\n/\n\nG(2, V10 )\n\nf\n\n\u000f\n\nFm (X \u2032 )\n\nf\nl\u203210\n\n/\n\n\u000f\n\n\u2032\nG(2, V10\n),\n\nwhere the maps l10 and l\u203210 have degree 2 onto their images, and factor\nthrough the involutions \u03b9 and \u03b9\u2032 respectively. Therefore we recover \u03b9\nand \u03b9\u2032 , and also the points [cX ] \u2208 Fg (X) and [cX \u2032 ] \u2208 Fg (X \u2032 ).\nThe map f induces a map from the diagram (20) to the corresponding\ndiagram for X \u2032 .\nWe must think of the map l8 as sending a conic c to the line hc \u2229\n\u03b9(c)i \u2013 except that we do not know yet how to identify a point in\nthe abstract surface Fg (X) with a conic on X. What we have is the\nabstract 2-dimensional family of lines Im(l8 ) in P(V8 ). If we knew how\nto construct W in P(V8 ), intersecting it with these lines, we would get\na surface S, and the base-locus of the quadrics containing S would be\nX.\nThe problem at this point is that we do not know how to locate\nW in our abstract P(V8). Logachev's idea is to use the birational\nisomorphism \u03ba\u22121 : P4 99K W defined in \u00a73.6 to reconstruct W . Since\nits inverse \u03ba is just the projection from the 2-plane \u03a0 = hcX i, we first\nneed to reconstruct this plane.\n\n\fPRIME FANO THREEFOLDS OF DEGREE 10\n\n35\n\nStep 2. Let L\u03b9 be the image of L\u03c3 in F\u03b9 (X). For [c] \u2208 L\u03b9 , the line\nl8 ([c]) is tangent to the conic c\u2228U \u2282 \u03a0. So we recover the plane \u03a0, and\nthe isomorphism L\u03c3 \u2243 c\u2228U \u2243 cU . Moreover f induces an isomorphism\nbetween \u03a0 and the corresponding plane \u03a0\u2032 \u2282 P(V8\u2032 ), restricting to an\nisomorphism between the conics c\u2228U and (c\u2032U )\u2228 .\nOn the other hand, there exists a finite set of points [c] in F\u03b9 (X) L\u03b9\nsuch that l8 ([c]) meets \u03a0. Moreover the intersection points with \u03a0\nbelong to a unique conic in \u03a0,11 namely cX \u2282 \u03a0. We can therefore\nrecover this conic from our data, in such a way that f induces an\nisomorphism between cX \u2282 \u03a0 and c\u2032X \u2282 \u03a0\u2032 .\nStep 3. Now consider the projection from V8 to V8 /U3\u2228 . The next claim\nis that we can reconstruct the rational cubic \u039303 \u2282 P(V8/U3\u2228 ).\nFor this we observe that from the two conics cX and c\u2228U in \u03a0, we can\ndefine the elliptic curve\n\u03931X = {(t, x) \u2208 c\u2228U \u00d7 cX | x \u2208 Tc\u2228U ,t },\na double cover of both cX and c\u2228U . Let S2,V8 denote the rank-2 tautological bundle on G(2, V8). There is an obvious map from P(S2,V8 ) to\nP(V8). On the other hand, we have a chain of inclusions\n\u03931X \u0592\u2192 P(l\u22178 S2,V8 )|L\u03b9 \u0592\u2192 P(l\u22178 S2,V8 ).\nThe rational map defined as the composition\nP(l\u22178 S2,V8 ) \u2192 P(S2,V8 ) \u2192 P(V8 ) 99K P(V8 /U3\u2228 )\nis not defined on \u03931X . However, since P(l\u22178 S2,V8 )|L\u03b9 is a divisor in\nP(l\u22178S2,V8 ), the restriction to this divisor is a well-defined rational map.\nAnd since \u03931X is itself a divisor in P(l\u22178 S2,V8 )|l , the restriction is again\nwell-defined. We end up with a well-defined map \u03931X \u2192 P(V8 /U3\u2228 ).\nOf course we can do the same for X \u2032 , and we get a compatible isomorphism between \u03931X and \u03931X \u2032 .\nNow recall (\u00a73.6) that the total transform of a point x of \u03a0 by the\nbirational isomorphism \u03ba : W 99K P(V8 /U3 ) is a line lx that meets \u039303\nat the points corresponding to those two points in c\u2228U whose tangents\npass through x. This implies that a point (t, x) in \u03931X must be mapped\nin P(V8 /U3 ) to some point p(t, x) of the bisecant lt .\nBut there is another point (t\u2032 , x) on \u03931X , mapping to a point p(t\u2032 , x)\non the same bisecant line lx . Since, in general, p(t, x) 6= p(t\u2032 , x),12 we\ncan recover the line lx as the line joining these two points. Finally,\nif we consider the points (t, x) and (t, x\u2032 ) of \u03931X , we see that the lines\nlx and lx\u2032 must meet on the point of \u039303 corresponding to t. So this\n11One\n12This\n\nmust check that we get at least five such intersection points; see [L].\ncan be checked by a lengthy direct calculation.\n\n\f36\n\nO. DEBARRE, A. ILIEV, AND L. MANIVEL\n\nprocess allows to reconstruct the curve \u039303 , and an isomorphism with\nc\u2228U .\nStep 4. From \u039303 \u2282 P(V8 /U3 ), we can reconstruct a copy of W , say\nW \u2020 \u2282 V8\u2020 , as the image of the birational map defined by the linear\nsystem of quadrics through \u039303 . We get the diagram\n|I\u03930 (2)|\n\nP(V8 ) 99K P(V8/U3 )\n\u222a\n\u222a\nW\n\u039303\n\n3\n\n99K\n\nW\u2020\n\u2229\nP(V8\u2020 )\n\nWe do not know yet where to locate W in P(V8 ), but we know that\nthe identification of W with W \u2020 induces a unique linear isomorphism\nbetween P(V8 ) and P(V8\u2020 ). What we need to do is to recover this\nisomorphism from our data.\nFirst observe that to a general point [c] of F (X) should correspond\na conic (c, V4 ), and the point \u03b8([c]) = [U3 \u2229 V4 ] in \u03a0 = G(2, U3 ).\nFrom our present knowledge, this point can be recovered as follows:\nthe line l5 ([c]), image of l8 ([c]) in G(2, V8 /U3 ), meets the linear span\nof \u039303 at one point. This point belongs to a unique bisecant line to\n\u039303 , meeting \u039303 at two points which we can identify with two points of\nc\u2228U . The intersection of the corresponding tangents is \u03b8([c]). Moreover,\nwe know that the projection P(V8) 99K P(V8 /U3 ), once restricted to\nP(MV4 ), can be identified with the projection through that point \u03b8([c]);\nin particular this applies to l8 ([c]), and we can conclude that l5 ([c]) is\nthe image of l8 ([c]) by projection from \u03b8([c]).\nNow Logachev considers those pairs (c, c\u2032 ) such that l5 ([c]) and l5 ([c\u2032 ])\nmeet at one point, say m(c, c\u2032 ); there is a two-dimensional family of\nsuch pairs. We know the image of m(c, c\u2032 ) in P(V8\u2020 ), and we want to\nreconstruct its preimage n(c, c\u2032 ) in P(V8 ). But this is easy: l5 ([c]) and\n\u03b8([c]) generate a plane \u03a0c , which meets the corresponding plane \u03a0c\u2032 at\na unique point, which is n(c, c\u2032 ).13\nWe are thus able to reconstruct the isomorphism P(V8 ) \u2192 P(V8\u2020 )\non the special points n(c, c\u2032 ). Since they are not contained in any hyperplane, they completely determine the isomorphism we were looking\nfor.\nStep 5. In the preceding steps, we have reconstructed W in P(V8).\nMoreover, we have done that from purely projective constructions in\nterms of the family of lines l8 ([c]), when [c] describes the abstract\n13To\n\nsee this, observe that \u03a0c is contained in the 3-plane \u0398c = P(V8 ) \u2229 P(\u22272 V4 ),\nwhich meets \u0398c\u2032 along P(V8 ) \u2229 P(\u22272 (V4 \u2229 V4\u2032 )); but in general this is just a point.\nSo it must be n(c, c\u2032 ).\n\n\fPRIME FANO THREEFOLDS OF DEGREE 10\n\n37\n\n\u223c\nsurface Fm (X). This implies that the isomorphism f : Fg (X) \u2192\nFg (X \u2032 )\n\u2032\ninduces an isomorphism \u03c6 between P(V8 ) and P(V8 ), mapping W to\nan isomorphic copy W \u2032 , and compatible with l8 and l\u20328 . This means\nthat we can recover a surface S in X by intersecting the lines l8 (c) with\nW , and that f maps S to the corresponding surface S \u2032 in X \u2032 .\nBut S determines X, as the intersection of the quadrics in P(V8)\ncontaining S 14 and this implies that \u03c6 maps X isomorphically onto X \u2032 .\nFinally, u = f \u22121 \u25e6 \u03c6\u2217 is an automorphism of Fg (X) which descends\nto an automorphism um of Fm (X) such that l8 \u25e6 um = l8 . Since l8 is\ngenerically injective, um is the identity, hence so is u.
