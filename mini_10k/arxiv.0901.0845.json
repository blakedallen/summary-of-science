From our radio observations of the magnetic field strength and large-scale pattern\nof spiral galaxies of different Hubble types and star formation rates (SFR) we conclude that \u2013\nthough a high SFR in the disk increases the total magnetic field strength in the disk and the\nhalo \u2013 the SFR does not change the global field configuration nor influence the global scale\nheights of the radio emission. The similar scale heights indicate that the total magnetic field\nregulates the galactic wind velocities. The galactic wind itself may be essential for an effective\ndynamo action.\nKeywords. galaxies: spiral \u2013 magnetic fields \u2013 halos, radio continuum: galaxies\n\n1. Magnetic field strength and star formation\nObservations of a sample of three late-type galaxies with low surface-brightness and\nthe radio-weak edge-on galaxy NGC 5907 (all with a low SFR) revealed that they all have\nan unusually high thermal fraction and weak total and regular magnetic fields (Chy\u017cy\net al. 2007, Dumke et al. 2000). However, these objects still follow the total radio-FIR\ncorrelation, extending it to the lowest values measured so far. Hence, these galaxies have\na lower fraction of synchrotron emission than galaxies with higher SFR. It is known\nthat the thermal intensity is proportional to the SFR. Our findings fit to the equipartition model for the radio-FIR correlation (Niklas & Beck 1997), according to which the\nnonthermal emission increases \u221d SF R1.3\u00b10.2 and the total magnetic field strength Bt\nincreases \u221d SF R0.34\u00b10.14 .\nNo similar simple relation exists for the regular magnetic field strength. We integrated\nthe polarization properties in 41 nearby spiral galaxies and found that (independently of\ninclination effects) the degree of polarization is lower (< 4%) for more luminous galaxies,\nin particular those for L4.8 > 2 \u00d7 1021 WHz\u22121 (Stil et al. 2008). The radio-brightest\ngalaxies are those with the highest SFR. Though a dynamo action needs star formation\nand supernova remnants as the driving force for velocities in vertical direction, we conclude from our observations that stronger star formation seems to reduce the magnetic\nfield regularity. On kpc-scales, Chy\u017cy (2008) analyzed the correlation between magnetic\nfield regularity and SFR locally within one galaxy, NGC 4254. While he found that the\ntotal and random field strength increase locally with SFR, the regular field strength is\nlocally uncorrelated with SFR.\n\n2. Vertical scale heights and CR-driven galactic wind\nWe determined the exponential scale heights of the total power emission at \u03bb6 cm for\nfour edge-on galaxies (NGC 253, NGC 891, NGC 3628, NGC 4565) for which we have\n119\n\n\f120\n\nM. Krause\n\ncombined interferometer and single-dish data (VLA and the 100-m Effelsberg). In spite\nof their different intensities and extents of the radio emission, the vertical scale heights\nof the thin disk and the thick disk/halo are similar in this sample (300 pc and 1.8 kpc)\n(Dumke & Krause 1998, Heesen et al. 2009). We stress that our sample includes the\nbrightest halo observed so far, NGC 253, with a very high SFR, as well as one of the\nweakest halos, NGC 4565, with a small SFR.\nFor NGC 253 Heesen et al. (this volume) argued that the synchrotron lifetime (which\nis \u221d B\u22122\n) mainly determines the vertical scale height of the synchrotron emission and\nt\nestimated the cosmic ray bulk velocity to 300 \u00b1 30 km/s. As this is similar to the escape\nvelocity, it shows the presence of a galactic wind in this galaxy. The fact that we observe\nsimilar averaged scaleheights at \u03bb6 cm for the four galaxies mentioned above imply that\nthe galactic wind velocity is proportional to B2t , and hence proportional to SFR0.7\u00b10.3 .\n\n3. Magnetic field structure, dynamo action, and galactic wind\nIn a larger sample of 11 edge-on galaxies we found in all of them (except the inner\npart of NGC 4631, see Krause 2009) mainly a disk-parallel magnetic field along the\ngalactic midplane together with an X-shaped poloidal field in the halo. Our sample\nincludes spiral galaxies of different Hubble types and SFR, ranging from 0.5 M\u2299 yr\u22121 6\nSFR 6 27 M\u2299 yr\u22121 . The disk-parallel magnetic field is the expected edge-on projection\nof the spiral magnetic field within the disk as observed in face-on galaxies. It is generally\nthought to be generated by a mean-field \u03b1\u03a9-dynamo for which the most easily excited\nfield pattern is the axismmetric spiral (ASS) field (e.g. Beck et al. 1996). The poloidal\npart of the ASS dynamo field alone, however, cannot explain the observed X-shaped\nstructures in edge-on galaxies as the field strength there seems to be comparable to\nthat of the large-scale disk field. Model calculations of the mean-field \u03b1\u03a9-dynamo for a\ndisk surrounded by a spherical halo including a galactic wind (Brandenburg et al. 1993)\nsimulated similar field configurations as the observed ones. New MHD simulations are in\nprogress (see e.g. Gressel et al. this volume, Hanasz et al. this volume) which include a\ngalactic wind implicitely. A galactic wind can also solve the helicity problem of dynamo\naction (e.g. Sur et al. 2007). Hence, a galactic wind may be essential for an effective\ndynamo action, and to explain the observed similar vertical scale heights and X-shaped\nmagnetic field structure in edge-on galaxies.\nReferences\nBeck, R., Brandenburg, A., Moss, D., Shukurov, A., Sokoloff, & D.D. 1996, ARAA 34, 155\nBrandenburg, A., Donner, K.J., Moss, D., Shukurov, A., Sokoloff, & D.D., Tuominen, I. 1993,\nA&A 271, 36\nChy\u017cy, K.T., Bomans, D.
