Recent observations (e.g., Kulkarni et al. 1999) suggest the association of GRBs with the final stages of evolution of massive\nstars (Woosley 1993, Paczy\u0144ski 1998; MacFadyen & Woosley\n1999), but many crucial points still remain controversial.\nThe possible evidence of rebrightening shown by the optical\nafterglows of several bursts \u223c 30 days after the burst explosion (Bloom et al. 1999; Reichart 1999; Galama et al. 2000)\nsuggests a simultaneous explosion of the burst with a Type\nIc supernova. On the other hand, the detection of iron absorption and emission features in the X\u2013ray emission of the\nbursts and afterglows (Amati et al. 2000; Piro et al. 2000)\ncan be explained with a two\u2013step explosion, in which the\nburst onset follows a supernova explosion by several months\n(Lazzati et al. 1999; Vietri et al. 2001; Lazzati et al. 2001).\nThese different scenarios can be distinguished through\nthe analysis of the radial distribution of the interstellar\nmedium surrounding the explosion site (Ghisellini et al.\n1999). If the burst explodes simultaneously with the supernova, the photons propagate through the pre\u2013explosion\nstellar wind, while in the two\u2013step scenario a high density\nmetal enriched supernova remnant is expected to surround\nthe burst explosion site (Lazzati et al. 1999).\nIn this paper we study the variability properties of photoionization edges in the first several tens of seconds from\nthe burst onset, for the different radial distributions of the\nc 0000 RAS\n\ndensity profile characterizing these two scenarios. Temporal\nvariations of the opacities are indeed expected as a result\nof the gradual photoionization of the medium by the X-ray\nprompt emission of the burst. A similar variability effect on\nabsorption lines had been discussed by Perna & Loeb (1998)\nand, in the X\u2013rays, by B\u00f6ttcher et al. (1999). In these papers, however, dependences on the radial profile of the density had not been considered.\nThe paper is organized as follows: in \u00a72, we present\nsome analytic approximations for the time-dependent opacities which hold for the optically thin case, discussed in \u00a73. In\n\u00a74, we present the results of the general (numerical) solution\nto the problem, and compare it with the analytic approximations derived in \u00a72. In \u00a75, we discuss possible effects of\nthe fireball expansion in the absorbing medium. Finally, our\nresults are summarized in \u00a76.\n2\n\nANALYTIC THEORY\n\nConsider a distribution n(r) of absorbers, characterized by a\nphotoionization cross\u2013section \u03c3. In the case of an impulsive\nillumination by a strong ionizing flux the density n(r) becomes time dependent, and so does the absorption opacity:\n\u03c4 (t) = \u03c3\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nn(r, t) dr\n\n(1)\n\n0\n\nTo solve Eq. 1, we must determine the time\u2013dependent density n(r, t). We use a particular time reference: at each radius\nr from the photon source, the time is set to be zero when the\nfirst ionizing photon passes by. By saying that the ionization\n\n\f2\n\nLazzati, Perna & Ghisellini\n\ntime at radius r\u0303 is t\u0303, we then mean that t\u0303 is the time interval\nbetween the first ionizing photon crossing the radius r\u0303 and\nthe complete ionization of all absorbing ions located at the\nsame radius. The advantage of this time reference is that the\ntravel time of photons is null, and the time t is also the time\nmeasured by an observer at infinity. The same conceptual\nscheme applies in \u00a75 for the radius of the fireball.\nConsider now a medium in which recombination is not\nefficient and let us neglect the change of the resonant frequency as an atom is progressively stripped off its electrons\nfrom the ground state to complete ionization. The first condition is easily fulfilled in GRBs, given their high ionization\nflux during the prompt phase (exceptions may however be\npossible, see Lazzati et al. 2001). In this case the density\nn(r, t) remains constant until all electrons are stripped. The\ntime of complete stripping depends on the distance r of an\natom from the photon source. We assume that, at a given\nradius r\u0303, n(r\u0303, t) changes abruptly in time:\nn(r\u0303, t) = n(r\u0303) \u03c7[0,Z\u0303 tion (r\u0303)] (t)\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03c7[a,b] (x) = 1 for a \u2264 x \u2264 b and 0 elsewhere, tion is the\nionization time of a single electron and Z\u0303 is the \"efficient\nnumber\" of electrons of the relative element. Z\u0303 is in general\nsmaller than the atomic number Z of the element, since\nother processes can contribute to ionization. These include\ncollisional ionization, the Auger effect and the ionization of\nthe external electrons by the UV flux. The actual value of\nZ\u0303 can be obtained through numerical simulations and is not\nuniversal, being dependent on the ionizing UV continuum\nand the density of the absorbing medium (see \u00a7 4). The\nionization time of a single electron is given by:\ntion =\n\n\u0014Z\n\n\u221e\n\n\u03bd0\n\nF (\u03bd)\n\u03c3(\u03bd) d\u03bd\nh\u03bd\n\n\u0015\u22121\n\n(3)\n\n4\u03c0 r 2\n\n=\n\nR\u221e\n\u03bd0\n\n=\n\nL(\u03bd)\nh\u03bd\n\nL(\u03bd)\n\u03bd0 h \u03bd\n\ne\u2212\u03c4 (\u03bd) \u03c3(\u03bd) d\u03bd\n\ne\n\n\u2212\u03c3(\u03bd)\n\nRr\n0\n\nn(\u03c1,t) d\u03c1\n\n(4)\n\u03c3(\u03bd) d\u03bd\n\nwhere L(\u03bd) is the luminosity of the ionizing continuum and\n\u03bd0 is the threshold photoionization frequency. Note that the\nionization time, needed to compute the density of absorbers,\ndepends on the density itself in a non\u2013linear way. For this\nreason Eq. 4 does not have a general analytical solution.\n\n3\n\nOPTICALLY THIN MEDIA\n\n\u03bd0\n\n4\u03c0 r 2\nL(\u03bd)\nh\u03bd\n\n\u03c3(\u03bd) d\u03bd\n\n\u03c4 (\u03bd, t) = \u03c30\n\n\u0010\n\n\u03bd\n\u03bd0\n\n4\u03c0 r 2\nL0 \u03c30\n\n\u0011\u22123 Z\n\n(6)\n\n\u221e\n\nn(r) dr\n\n(7)\n\nRif (t)\n\nRif (t) =\n\n\u0012\n\nL0 \u03c30 t\n4\u03c0 h Z\u0303 (3 + \u03b1)\n\n(5)\n\n\u00131/2\n\n(8)\n\nAssuming an absorbing medium whose density decreases as\na power law with distance, [n(r) = n0 (r/R0 )\u2212\u03b2 ], we obtain\n\u03c4 (\u03bd, t) = \u03c30\n\n\u0010\n\n\u03bd\n\u03bd0\n\n\u0011\u22123\n\nn0 R0\u03b2\n\nZ\n\nmax[RM ,Rif (t)]\n\nr \u2212\u03b2 dr\n\n(9)\n\nmax[R0 ,Rif (t)]\n\nwhere RM and R0 are the maximum and minimum radii\nof the density profile. This avoids unphysical divergences at\nvery large and very small radii. With this assumptions Eq. 9\nbecomes:\n\u03c4 (\u03bd, t) = \u03c30 n0 R0\u03b2\n\nIf the absorbing medium is optically thin, the flux at a given\nradius does not depend (at least as a first approximation)\non the absorption taking place at smaller radii.

Examples of this behavior are shown in Fig. 1 (dashed lines) for three different\ninitial conditions: an opaque (\u03c4 (0) \u223c 13) cloud, an intermediate (\u03c4 (0) \u223c 1.3) cloud and a thin (\u03c4 (0) \u223c 0.13)\ncloud. We have considered the photoionization edge of iron,\nwith a resonance cross section \u03c30 \u223c 2 \u00d7 10\u221220 cm2 and a\nthreshold frequency h \u03bd = 9.28 keV. The parameterization\nadopted for the ionizing flux and the ambient medium is:\nL0 = 1.75 \u00d7 1031 erg s\u22121 Hz\u22121 , \u03b1 = 0 (similarly to the spectrum of GRB 990705, Amati et al. 2000), R0 = 1013 cm,\nRM = 1 pc and n0 = 200, 20, 2 cm\u22123 , respectively. These\nconditions are quite extreme, since they correspond to a total mass of the absorbing iron of \u223c 1000, 100 and 10 M\u2299 ,\nrespectively. On the other hand, a \u03c4 \u223c 1 feature lasting for\n\u223c 10 seconds has indeed been detected (Amati et al. 2000),\nand very large iron masses are required, in some scenarios,\nto explain this feature (see Lazzati et al. 2001 and references\ntherein for a more complete discussion).\nWe have considered in the simulation a constant ionizing luminosity. This is not generally true for GRBs, where\nfluctuations on timescales of fractions of seconds are usually\nobserved. This would cause small scale fluctuations, with\nthe same timescale, on the time evolution of the opacities,\nbut the general trend is unaffected. Moreover, the burst may\nturn off before the complete ionization of the surrounding\nmedium. In this case the results of this paper would hold\nonly for times smaller than the turn off time of the GRB.\nBy comparison with the numerical simulations presented in \u00a74 (where the approximations of \u00a72 are released),\nthe \"efficient number\" of electrons of iron in these conditions turns out to be Z\u0303Fe \u223c 7. The dashed lines have been\ncomputed adopting this value.\nIn Fig. 2, we show the time of complete ionization of\nthe iron ions as a function of the distance from the source of\nthe ionizing photons. In the analytic approximation of Eq. 8,\nthis time does not depend on the initial opacity and density\ndistribution of the medium.\n\n3.2\n\nDecaying density profiles\n\nLet us consider now the case of a density profile decreasing\nwith distance from the burst source. This can correspond,\nfor example, to a pre\u2013explosion stellar wind if the bursts are\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nFigure 2. Time of complete ionization vs. radius for the same\ngeometrical setup of Fig. 1. The dashed line shows the analytic\napproximation of Eq. 8. The symbols refer to the same cases of\nFig. 1. Since in the simulations the approximation of the step\nfunction (Eq. 2) is not used, the symbols are relative to the time\nat which the fraction of iron completely ionized is a half of the\ntotal. The thin solid lines in the upper left corner of the figure\nshow the time at which the fireball crosses the radius Rif (see \u00a75).\nSince this time is always much larger than the time of ionization,\nthe hydrodynamics of the fireball does not influence the evolution\nof the opacity.\n\nassociated with the death of massive stars. In this case we\nwould have \u03b2 = 2 (Chevalier & Li, 1999).\nIf the density of the absorbing medium decreases with\ndistance sufficiently rapidly (\u03b2 > 1), the maximum radius\ncan be set to infinity and Eq. 10 becomes:\n\u03c4 (\u03bd, t) =\n\n\u03c30 n0 R0\u03b2\n\n\u03bd\n\u03bd0\n\n\u03b2\u22121\n\n\u0001\u22123 \u001a\n\nR01\u2212\u03b2\n\nRif < R0\n\n(A t)\n\nRif > R0\n\n1\u2212\u03b2\n2\n\n(13)\n\nwhere A is given in Eq. 12. After a short initial constant\nphase, the opacity decreases in time as a power\u2013law whose\nslope depends only on the index \u03b2 of the density profile.\nThe time evolution of the opacity in a wind environment is\nshown in Fig. 3. We used R0 = 1013 cm and initial densities\nn0 = 109 , 108 and 107 cm\u22123 (corresponding to \u03c4 (0) \u223c 200,\n20 and 2). The parameters describing the ionization flux\nare the same used for Fig. 1. In Fig. 4, we show the time\nevolution of the radius of complete ionization, for the same\nparameters used for Fig. 3.\n\n4\n\nNUMERICAL RESULTS\n\nTo solve the problem in its full generality, we remove the approximations made in \u00a7 2. We start the simulation at t = 0,\nand let the burst photons propagate. In propagating from a\npoint at position r to another point at position r + \u2206r, the\nionizing flux is reduced according to:\nF\u03bd (r + \u2206r, t + \u2206t) = F\u03bd (r, t) exp[\u2212\u2206\u03c4\u03bd (r, t)]\n\nr2\n.(14)\n(r + \u2206r)2\n\nThe optical depth due to photoabsorption within the distance \u2206r is then given by:\n\n\f4\n\nLazzati, Perna & Ghisellini\n\nFigure 3. Opacity vs. time for a wind environment. Initially\nopaque, intermediate and thin winds are considered, from top to\nbottom (see text for the parameter set). The dashed lines correspond to the analytic approximations of Eq. 13, while the symbols\nare obtained with the numerical simulations described in \u00a74. As\nexpected, the analytic approximation holds for \u03c4 < 1.\n\n\u2206\u03c4\u03bd (r, t) = \u2206r\n\nX\n\nnj (r, t)\u03c3j (\u03bd) .\n\n(15)\n\nj\n\nThe photoionization cross sections are taken from Reilman\n& Manson (1979). The ionic concentrations are determined\nby solving the system of equations:\ndnj (r, t)\ndt\n\n=\n\nqj\u22122 nj\u22122 + qj\u22121 nj\u22121 + cj\u22121 nj\u22121 ne\n\n\u2212\n\n(qj + cj ne + \u03b1j ne )nj + \u03b1j+1 nj+1 ne .\n\n(16)\n\nThe qj and cj are respectively the photoionization and collisional ionization coefficients of ion j, while \u03b1j is the recombination coefficient. Note that qj\u22122 refers to inner shell\nphotoionization followed by Auger ionization. The collisional\nionization rates are calculated according to Younger (1981).\nWe compute the terms due to photoionization by integrating\nL\u03bd \u03c3\u03bd numerically. The recombination rates are given by the\nsum of the radiative and dielectronic recombination rates.\nThe code uses routines developed by Raymond (1979; see\nalso Perna, Raymond & Loeb 2000 for a similar application\nand further details). After updating the ionization\nR fractions\nat each time step \u2206t, the optical depth \u03c4\u03bd (t) = dr\u2206\u03c4\u03bd (r, t)\nis recomputed.\nA comparison between the numerical and analytical results is shown in Fig. 1, 2, 3 and 4. In all these figures, the\nanalytical approximation is drawn as a dashed line, while the\nnumerical results are overlaid as symbols (circles, diamonds\nand triangles). The introduction of recombination and collisional ionization does not change significantly the results\nwith respect to the analytic case, where only photoionization is considered. As expected, corrections must be applied\nin the optically thick regime.\nIn Fig. 1, the opacity is dominated by material at large\nradii. The analytic approximation is valid when the initial\n<\nopacity is small or intermediate (\u03c4 (0) \u223c\n1), but underestimates the time of decline for an initially opaque cloud. For\nboth the initially thin and thick cases, the analytic approx-\n\nFigure 4. Same as Fig. 2 but for the wind environment of Fig. 3.\n\nimation declines faster than the numerical result. This is\ndue to the approximation of Eq. 2, which severely underestimates the absorption at a given radius for t > tion (r).\nFig. 2 shows the time of complete ionization for the\nsame parameter set of Fig. 1. In the numerical simulations\nthe time of complete ionization is not a well defined quantity,\nsince at each radius and at any time there is always the possibility (albeit very small) to have ions with bounded electrons. To properly compare with the time defined in Eq. 6,\nwhich is plotted as a dashed line, the symbols (circles, diamonds and triangles) show the time at which about 50 % of\nthe iron is completely stripped (FeXXVII). The figure shows\nthat the analytic approximation reproduces accurately the\nnumeric results, with small deviations at large radii for the\ninitially opaque case.\nIn the case of a wind environment (Fig. 3), the opacity is\ndominated by material at small radii. The analytic approximation describes accurately the temporal decay of the opac<\nity in the optically thin and intermediate cases (\u03c4 (0) \u223c\n1).\nFor an initially optically thick medium, the numerical solution deviates at small times, but collapses onto the analytic\napproximation when the medium becomes optically thin.\nAgain, Z\u0303Fe \u223c 7 is adequate. The analytic time of complete\nionization for a wind environment is compared with the results of numerical simulations in Fig. 4. Again, the analytic\napproximation is adequately accurate at all times but for\nthe initially optically thick case, in which deviations are observed.\n\n5\n\nFIREBALL DYNAMICS\n\nFor all our calculations we have assumed that the ionization\nflux comes from a point source. This is not strictly true,\nsince in the fireball model the prompt radiation is produced\nby the expanding shell. To check whether our assumption is\nreasonable we must demonstrate that the fireball radius is\nsmaller than the ionization radius at all times.\nThe radius of the relativistic fireball expanding in\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fTime dependent opacities\nan inhomogeneous external medium is given by (see, e.g.,\nMeszaros, Rees & Wijers, 1998):\nRfb (t) = RIS +\n\nc\u039320\n\n(\n\nt\n3\u2212\u03b2\n4\u2212\u03b2\n\ntES t\n\nt \u2264 tES\n\n1\n4\u2212\u03b2\n\nt > tES\n\n,\n\n(17)\n\nwhere \u03930 is the asymptotic Lorentz factor of the fireball and\nRIS \u223c 1013 cm is the internal shock radius, i.e. the radius\nat which the first ionizing photons are produced. The time\ntES is the onset time of external shocks, where the fireball\nexpansion starts to be slowed down by the interaction with\nthe external medium. This is given by (Meszaros, Rees &\nWijers 1998):\ntES =\n\n\u001a\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n(3 \u2212 \u03b2) E\n+ R03 R0\u2212\u03b2\n4\u03c0 \u039320 mp c2 n{H,0}\n\n1\n\u001b 3\u2212\u03b2\n\n1\n,\n\u039320 c\n\n(18)\n\nwhere E is the total fireball energy, mp the proton mass,\nand a particle distribution nH (R) = n{H,0} (r/R0 )\u2212\u03b2 has\nbeen assumed. Note that the distribution of particles in the\nexternal medium follows the distribution of the absorbers\ngiven above. The normalization are instead different. For\nsolar iron abundance we have n0 = 4.68 \u00d7 10\u22125 n{H,0} (Anders & Grevesse 1989).\nIn Fig. 2 and 4, the time at which the fireball crosses\nthe radius Rif is plotted with thin solid lines. We assumed\na fireball with E = 1052 erg and \u03930 = 100, and an iron\nabundance ten times solar. It can be seen that the fireball\ncrossing time is always much larger than the time of ionization. We conclude that, for a reasonable set of parameters,\nthe assumption of decoupling between the ionization and the\nhydrodynamics is valid.\n\n6\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have calculated the time dependence of the absorption\nopacities due to the material in the surroundings of gamma\u2013\nray bursts. We have been able to qualitatively reproduce\nthe numerical results with analitic expressions using some\napproximations appropriate for the optically thin regime.\nIn the optically thick regime, corrections must be applied. In the case of a uniform medium, the analytic expressions fail to reproduce exactly the lifetime of the absorption\nfeature (i.e. the timescale of constant optical depth), while\nin the wind case the analytic expressions are in good agreement with the numerical results at all but the very early\ntimes.\nAn important issue is the observability of these features.\nOn one hand, we require the density of the surrounding\nmedium to be high, in order to have the highest possible\nopacity. On the other hand (Lazzati et al. 2001), the Thomson scattering optical depth, \u03c4T , of the absorbing material\nmust be less than one, in order to maintain the flickering behavior of the \u03b3\u2013ray lightcurve. For a given Thomson opacity,\nthe iron opacity is given by \u03c4Fe \u223c 1.5\u03c4T AFe , where AFe is the\niron abundance in solar units. Iron enriched media are hence\n<\nnecessary to observe a deep iron feature in a \u03c4T \u223c\n0.1 cloud.\nEnriched media around GRBs have indeed been observed\n(Amati et al. 2000; Lazzati et al. 2001).\nFor the wind environment, the absorption feature has\nan extremely short lifetime, not detectable with the present\nand near future detectors and instruments. It then appears\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n5\n\nthat a stellar wind, even if strong and appropriate to a very\nmassive progenitor, is not able to imprint a detectable absorption feature in the X\u2013ray spectrum of bursts. The reason\nis the immediate ionization of the absorbing material. However, there is still the possibility that the wind of the progenitor, especially in the last phases, is unsteady and intermittent, therefore populating the burst environment with a\ndensity profile different from R\u22122 and corresponding to more\nmass at larger radii than the case we assumed. If this case\ncan be described by a larger value of R0 , then the lifetime\nof the absorption feature should scale as R02 and detectable\nfeatures may appear if R0 \u223c 1015 cm and/or with a weaker\nionization flux, i.e. in X\u2013ray poor bursts. If, beyond R0 , the\ndensity profile retains a power law profile, then also the absorption optical depth decreases in time as a power law, and\nthis discriminates the wind case from the uniform density\nscenario, where the fall off of the absorption feature should\nbe more abrupt.\nThe required time resolved X\u2013ray spectroscopic observations are beyond the capabilities of present instruments\nand satellites, which can provide only a time integrated\nmeasurement of the opacity on timescales of 5 \u00f7 10 seconds (cfr. Amati et al. 2000). The Swift satellite, however,\nwill be able to slew on target and to start the observations\nwith the X\u2013ray telescope in a few seconds (in particularly\nfavorable cases), and will be sensitive enough to measure\ntime\u2013resolved opacities (Perna et al., in preparation).\n\nREFERENCES\nAmati L. et al., 2000, Science, 290, 953\nAnders, E., & Grevesse, N. 1989, Geochim.
