Such transients\nare an important feature of naturally occurring biological networks, in particular in developmental biology, and can also be exploited for forward design of\ngenetic elements in Synthetic Biology. Here, we investigate the dynamics of\nunidirectional rings of genetic repressors and show that their observable dynamics is dominated by oscillatory transients around unstable periodic orbits\nwith strong spatio-temporal symmetries. The oscillatory transients around such\norbits can be seen to correspond to the propagation of groups of kink-like excitations against the background of a dimerized solution, a picture with strong\nparallelisms with classic discrete lattice models1\u20133 , some of which have been implemented experimentally with electronic elements.\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe dynamics of symmetric interconnected systems are an intricate reflection of the in-\n\nherent invariance associated with the symmetry present in the system4 . Engineered systems\noften resort to the use of symmetry because of the simplification in design and construction\nthey afford, but also as a means to the production of controlled outcomes. Loops or ring\nstructures of nonlinear elements5\u20137 constitute one of the simplest topologies of practical interest in biology and engineering8\u201311 . For instance, in a recent series of papers 3,9,12,13 Bulsara\net al reported the implementation of rings of unidirectionally coupled magnetic flux-gates\nthrough electronic circuits and their successful experimental use as highly sensitive magnetic\nfield sensors3,9,12,13 . The mathematical analysis of the steady-state dynamics of a variety of\nsuch ring systems has also revealed their rich dynamical behavior, including multi-stability,\nunstable periodic solutions, quasi-periodicity and even chaos and hyperchaos7,9,13 .\nThese classic design concepts have found new applicability with the recent emergence of\nSynthetic Biology, a field which has put to use ideas from electrical engineering, computer\nscience and physics to engineer circuits made up of biological parts, in many cases through\n2\n\n\fUPOs in the generalized repressilator\nthe design of gene regulatory networks14,15 . Such synthetic circuits of interconnected genes\nhave been implemented in living microbes to perform low-level functions, such as logical\ngates16 , switches17 and genetic oscillators10 , exploiting the steady-state behavior of the gene\nnetwork.\nHere, we study the spatio-temporal dynamics of the generalized repressilator, a gene\nregulatory network of repressing genes cyclically coupled in a directed ring topology (see\nFig. 1a), and we concentrate on the investigation of the role of unstable periodic orbits\n(UPOs) on the observable transient dynamics. The study of the generalized repressilator\nmodel has a long history18\u201320 . As shown analytically in 19, there is a fundamental difference\nbetween rings with odd and even number of monotonic repressors: at steady state, oddnumbered rings possess a limit cycle attractor while even-numbered rings are bistable and\nact as switches. Hence the generalized repressilator model bridges between switches and\noscillators in a natural way. In fact, the first ever genetic oscillator realized in a living\nbacterium by Elowitz and Leibler 10 is a special case of the generalized repressilator for three\ngenes, while the first genetic switch implemented in E. coli by Gardner et al. 17 corresponds\nto the generalized repressilator with two genes.\nPrevious mathematical work on these systems was mainly devoted to stability analysis\nand the characterization of the attractors that determine the long term behavior of the\nrings. On the other hand, the study of the transient behavior, in particular in relation to the\npresence of UPOs, was broadly ignored. However, the standard steady-state analysis alone\nis not sufficient in systems where transients are qualitatively different from steady states\nand extend over long times compared to the observational time scales of the system, e.g.,\nthe average life time of a bacterial cell for a system like the repressilator. Even numbered\nrepressilator rings are examples of such systems: although their steady state is typically\nbistable, with two attracting fixed points19 , the fixed points are approached through longlived oscillating transients that dominate the observable dynamics21 . In a recent paper, we\nshowed that this transient behavior could be exploited to produce switchable oscillations by\nusing feedback to operate the system around these unstable oscillations21 .\nIn this paper, we show that the observed long-lived transients have their origin in the existence of UPOs that attract initial conditions to their vicinity, thus funneling the dynamics\ninto a lower-dimensional oscillatory subspace from which it is difficult to escape. The UPOs\nappear through a cascade of Hopf bifurcations, for which we provide analytical conditions,\n3\n\n\fUPOs in the generalized repressilator\na\n\n6\n\n15\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\np2\n\np2\n5\n\n5\n\nBifurcations for even rings HN=10L\n\n15\n\n1\n\n...\n\nBifurcations for odd rings HN=9L\n\nb\n\nN\n\n5\n\nH\n\n3\n\nH\n\np1\n\nP H\n\nNS\n\nN=9 HoddL\n\nH\n\np1\n\n4\nN=10 HevenL\n\nae\nae ae ae ae ae Im@\u039bl D\nae ae ae ae Im@\u039bl D\nae\nae\nae\nae\nae\nae\nae\nae\nae\nae\nae Re@\u039bl D ae\nae\nae Re@\u039bl D\nae\nae\nae\nae\naeae aeae\nae\nae\naeaeae\nae\n\n5\n\n5\nc\n\n10\n\nc\n\n10\n\nFIG. 1. The generalized repressilator model (a) The network consists of genes interconnected\nin a directed ring topology, in which the protein product of gene j represses the expression of gene\nj + 1 with periodic boundary conditions. (b) As the parameter c (see Eq. 3) is increased, a cascade\nof Hopf bifurcations emerges-here shown through p1 vs. p2 phase plots. In odd rings (exemplified\nby N = 9), an attracting limit cycle (meshed style) emerges from the first Hopf bifurcation (H).\nIn even rings (exemplified by N = 10), a pitchfork bifurcation (P) leads to two symmetrical stable\nfixed points (solid black lines), which we refer to as 'up/down' solutions. In both even and odd\nrings, further Hopf bifurcation lead to emergence of UPOs. The difference in the bifurcation\ncascades between even and odd gene rings can be understood from the pattern of the eigenvalues\nof the linearization around the symmetric fixed point pm . Some limit cycles in even rings undergo\nNeimark-Sacker bifurcations (NS) leading to an unstable torus.\n\nand possess spatio-temporal symmetries consistent with tilings of the ring with smaller basic\nsolutions22 . In addition, the dynamics around the UPOs can also be understood in terms\nof traveling kink-like excitations propagating against the backdrop of a dimerized discrete\nlattice-a picture analogue to other propagating waves in classical physics1,2,23 . The reachability and persistence of the dynamics around the UPOs, which make them observable, is\nrelated to the interaction and propagation of moving kinks in the lattice. Finally, we show\nthat these features also apply to the analysis of rings of magnetic flux-gates3 implemented experimentally with electronics-a system in which extremely long-lived oscillating transients\n(especially in the presence of noise) have been observed both experimentally and numerically\nin even-numbered rings that should be bistable according to steady state analysis.\n4\n\n\fUPOs in the generalized repressilator\nII.\n\nBIFURCATION ANALYSIS OF THE GENERALIZED\n\nREPRESSILATOR AND UPOS\n\nA standard model of the generalized repressilator with N genes is given by the following\nODEs:\n\u1e41j = c1 f (pj\u22121 ) \u2212 c2 mj\n\u1e57j = c3 mj \u2212 c4 pj\n\nj = 1, . . . , N.\n\n(1)\n\nHere, pj and mj describe protein and mRNA concentrations for each gene (with periodic\nboundary conditions such that p0 \u2261 pN ). The kinetic constants c1 and c3 represent the\nstrength of repression and transcription, respectively, while c2 and c4 correspond to degradation of each species. The repressing behavior is encapsulated by f (p), a positive function\nf : R+ \u2192 R+ that is bounded between 0 and 1 and is monotonically decreasing over its\n\ndomain. For such a function, the system (1) has a spatially uniform fixed point19 in which\n\nall proteins have the same concentration: pj = pj\u22121 = pm \u2200j.\nThroughout this paper, our numerics are performed using a standard Hill-type function,\nwhich is well established in biochemical modeling:\nf (p) =\n\n1\n,\n1 + ph\n\n(2)\n\nwhere h is the Hill coefficient. However, the outlined stability analysis is similar for any\npositive function that is bounded and monotonically decreasing. For the Hill function (2),\nthe uniform fixed point solution pm follows from solving the polynomial equation:\npm + ph+1\n=\nm\n\nc1 c3\n\u2261 c.\nc2 c4\n\n(3)\n\nFor the case h = 2, which is relevant in some Synthetic Biology implementations10 , the\ncubic equation that ensues can be solved explicitly using the Cardano method. Note that\nthis solution branch is independent of the number of genes in the ring and exists for all\npositive c. In fact, pm is the only fixed point when the repression (or coupling) c is small\nenough.\nAs the strength of the repressive coupling c increases, there is a qualitative difference\n5\n\n\fUPOs in the generalized repressilator\nbetween the bifurcations undergone by even- and odd-numbered rings (see Fig. 1). In odd\nrings, pm becomes unstable via a Hopf bifurcation resulting in a stable limit cycle. Even\nrings, on the other hand, first undergo a pitchfork bifurcation where two branches of stable\ndimerized solutions emerge. No further stable solutions appear as c is increased either for\neven or odd rings. Hence from the viewpoint of strict stability analysis, odd rings behave as\noscillators, with a globally attracting limit cycle, and even rings behave as switches, due to\ntheir bistability.\n\nThere are however other bifurcations that lead to the emergence of unstable solutions.\nIn both even and odd rings, further increasing the coupling c leads to a cascade of Hopf\nbifurcations, where each bifurcation gives rise to a UPO that emerges from the already\nunstable branch pm . In addition, numerical continuation24 also reveals the existence of\nNeimark-Sacker bifurcations in particular UPOs of even rings, in which an unstable torus\nemerges from the UPO. Figure 1 shows characteristic examples of these behaviors.\n\nThe conditions for the appearance of UPOs can be derived analytically from the instabilities of the spatially uniform fixed point pm . Eliminating the mRNA variables (mj ), Eq. (1)\ncan be rewritten as:\np\u0308j = c1 c3 f (pj\u22121 ) \u2212 (c2 + c4 )\u1e57j \u2212 c2 c4 pj .\n\n(4)\n\nThis corresponds to the system\n\u1e57j = qj\nq\u0307j = c1 c3 f (pj\u22121 ) \u2212 (c2 + c4 )qj \u2212 c2 c4 pj ,\n\n(5)\n\nwith linear and nonlinear parts as follows:\n\u017c = (IN \u2297 A)z + H(z).\n\n(6)\n\uf8eb\n\nHere, zT = (. . . pj qj . . .), IN is the N -dimensional identity matrix, A = \uf8ed\n\n0\n\n\u2212c2 c4 \u2212(c2 + c4 )\n\nand H(z) is a vector that contains the nonlinear coupling between the elements.\n6\n\n1\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\n\n\fUPOs in the generalized repressilator\nLinearizing around the fixed point pm we obtain the Jacobian\nJ|pm = (IN \u2297 A) + (G \u2297 H \u2217 )\n\uf8eb\nwhere H \u2217 = c1 c3 \uf8ed\n\n0\ndf\ndp\n\n0\n0\n\n(7)\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8 and the directed ring topology of the network is encoded in\n\npm\n\nthe N \u00d7 N adjacency matrix\n\n\uf8eb\n\n0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec1\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\nG=\uf8ec\n\uf8ec.\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec0\n\uf8ed\n0\n\n0\n\n0 ... 1\n\n0\n\n0 ...\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n... 1\n\n0\n\n0 ... 1\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n0\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n.\uf8f7\n\uf8f7.\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n0\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n0\n\nFourier-diagonalizing25 the circulant matrix G, we obtain the following complex quadratic\nequation for the eigenvalues \u03bb` of the Jacobian (7):\n\u03bb2` + (c2 + c4 )\u03bb` + c2 c4\n\ndf\n1\u2212c\ndp\n\n!\ne\n\n`\ni 2\u03c0\nN\n\n=0\n\n(8)\n\npm\n\nwith ` = {0, .., N \u2212 1}.\nThe necessary condition for a Hopf bifurcation, i.e., the existence of purely imaginary\nroots, leads to inequalities on the parameters26 that determine the number of bifurcations.\nIt then follows that the maximum number of Hopf bifurcation is (N/2 \u2212 1) for even rings\nand (N \u2212 1)/2 for odd rings (see Appendix).\nIf the repressor is described by the Hill function (2), we have\ndf\ndp\n\npm\n\n=\u2212\n\nhph+1\nm\n.\nc2\n\nWhen h = 2 and with parameters relevant for the reported Synthetic Biology experiments10 ,\nj\nk\n\u0004\n\u0001\u0005\n1 (N +1)\nthe number of Hopf bifurcations is limited to 2 2\nfor odd rings and 21 N2 \u2212 1 for\neven rings (see Appendix and Table I).\nApart from the first bifurcation in odd rings, which gives rise to an attracting limit cycle,\nall other Hopf bifurcations give rise to unstable periodic orbits (UPOs), as shown in Figure 1\nand summarized in Table I. Although UPOs do not lead to long term attractors, they can still\n7\n\n\fUPOs in the generalized repressilator\nbe important for practical applications if they are likely to be reached from random initial\nconditions (or as a result of random fluctuations) and they dictate long-lived dynamics that\nwill therefore feature in finite-time observations. As shown below, the UPOs that emerge\nfrom the first Hopf bifurcation in even rings have these characteristics for parameter ranges\nconsistent with biological experiments. In particular, with mRNA and protein life-times on\nthe order of minutes and Hill coeficients h \u2208 {2, . . . , 6}, the transient oscillatory behavior\nwould extend over several hours in rings of moderate size N \u223c 10 when the cellular doubling\ntime is on the order of one hour. Therefore the transient behavior dominates the observable\ndynamics.\nWe now explore the different dynamical facets of the emerging unstable periodic orbits.\nIn particular, we describe their spatio-temporal symmetry, and their relationship to tilings\nof the ring, and present their linear stability. We also show that these solutions can be\nunderstood in terms of traveling waves that correspond to propagating interacting kinks,\nanalogous to solutions from classical physics such as domain walls. We also show that,\nalthough unstable, these periodic solutions are reachable from random initial conditions and\nlong-lived and, as such, they are relevant in finite-time dynamics in real-world applications.\n\nIII.\n\nSPATIO-TEMPORAL SYMMETRIES OF UPOS OF THE\n\nGENERALIZED REPRESSILATOR MODEL\nThe discrete rotational symmetry of the equations (1) induces non-trivial symmetries\nin the UPOs which can be directly related to the linear stability of the solutions. Table I\npresents a summary of the bifurcation analysis and emerging solutions for N \u2208 [3, 18] carried\n\nout with the continuation software MATCONT24 . The analysis reveals that some of the\nhigher order bifurcations for larger rings have the same periods as lower order bifurcations\nin smaller rings. This is the result of a rotational symmetry of such solutions that correspond\nto a tiling of the ring, i.e., gene pj has exactly the same time behavior as gene pj+s . This can\nbe seen, for instance, in the unstable periodic solution that emerges from the second Hopf\nbifurcation in the N = 12 gene ring, where pj , pj+3 , pj+6 and pj+9 have the same time traces\n(see Fig. 2 a). Each triplet of consecutive elements follows a dynamics equivalent to that of\na 3-gene ring, i.e., the solution corresponds to the tiling of the 12-gene ring by four 3-gene\nrepressilators. Therefore, its period is the same as that of the 3-gene ring for the same set\n8\n\n\fUPOs in the generalized repressilator\n\n4\n\nof constants.\n\na\n\nb\np1\np1\np1\n\np1\n\np1\np1\n\np1\n\np1\n\nodd rings, which\nall other Hopf bip1\np1\np2\np3\np2\np3\np4\ndic orbits (UPOs),\ned in Table I.

Bifurcations, symmetries and kinks in the generalized repressilator model.\nThe analytical conditions (Eq. 8) for the emergence of UPOs are confirmed for rings of length\nN = {3, . . . , 18} through simulations and numerical continuation24 . The numerics have been\ncarried out for the Hill function with h = 2 for the following set of parameters: c2 = 0.12 min\u22121 , c3 =\n0.16 min\u22121 , c4 = 0.06 min\u22121 , and the bifurcation parameter c1 in the range (0, 3]. We have followed\nthe UPOs numerically calculating their Floquet exponents, period, and spatio-temporal symmetry.\nThe number of kinks has been numerically extracted from time traces according to Eq. (9). The\nUPOs are sorted by increasing period and solutions whose dynamics are equivalent by tiling are\nhighlighted with the same color. For instance, the basic 3-gene repressilator (bold red text) has an\nassociated family of symmetric tiling solutions for rings where the gene number N is a multiple of\nthree. Phase plots of the two solutions marked with asterisks are presented in Figure 2.\n\n10\n\n\fUPOs in the generalized repressilator\nIV.\n\nUPOS AS TRAVELING KINK SOLUTIONS\n\nAn alternative viewpoint to understand the dynamics of gene rings is to view the periodic\nsolutions in terms of propagating kinks against the backdrop of a dimerized ('up-down')\nsolution. Analogues to this picture are abundant in both the nonlinear waves literature and\nin classical examples in condensed matter physics, such as propagation of domain walls in\nantiferromagnetic chains or soliton-like excitations in dimerized polymer chains1,2,23 .\nThe link between the dynamical bifurcations presented above and the kink-domain picture follows straightforwardly from the examination of the fixed points of the system. As\nexplained above, the uniform solution, where all proteins have the same value pj = pm , \u2200j,\nis always a fixed point of the system and is the global attractor of the equations for small\nenough values of the coupling parameter c.\nWhen the coupling between the genes is large enough, the uniform solution becomes\nunstable either through a Hopf bifurcation (for odd rings) or through a pitchfork bifurcation\n(for even rings). The two stable fixed points that emerge from the pitchfork bifurcation\nin even rings correspond to dimerized solutions ('up-down') where genes are over-expressed\n(pu >pm ) or under-expressed (pd <pm ) in an alternating sequence around the ring. This\narrangement leads to two degenerate solutions, equivalent by a one-gene rotation, which\ncorrespond to the sequences 'up-down' and 'down-up', respectively. Clearly, such a dimerized\nsolution is compatible with an even ring but not with an odd ring.\nIn the case of an odd ring, trying to fit an 'up-down' solution leads to frustration due\nto the boundary conditions, originating a kink mismatch when wrapping up the sequence.\nIndeed, the first Hopf bifurcation in odd rings can be viewed as the emergence of a propagating solution of this type. Hence the attracting limit cycles in odd rings correspond to\nthe fundamental solution with one traveling kink propagating against a background of the\ndimerized solution. The localized structure of the kink (domain wall) is shown in Figure 3a\nfor a ring of size N = 51. A quantitative description of the dynamics of the kinks can be\nobtained from numerical simulations by defining the threshold function:\n\n\u03bd(pj ) =\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f21\n\nif pj \u2265 pm\n\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\u22121 if pj < pm\n\n\u2261 'up'\n\n(9)\n\n\u2261 'down',\n\nwhich allows us to define the domain regions as sequences of alternating genes. The location\n11\n\n\fUPOs in the generalized repressilator\nof the kinks is then defined by the condition \u03bd(pj ) = \u03bd(pj+1 ).\na\n\nb\nae ae ae ae ae ae ae ae ae ae ae ae\n\npj\n\nae\n\nae ae ae ae\n\nae ae ae ae ae ae ae ae ae ae\n\nae\n\nae ae ae ae ae ae\n\nae\n\nae\n\npm\n\npj\n\nae ae ae ae ae ae ae ae ae ae ae ae\n\nae\nae\n\npm\n\nae\n\nae\nae ae ae ae ae ae ae ae ae ae ae ae ae ae ae ae ae ae ae ae ae ae ae ae ae\n\nae ae ae ae\n\nae\n\nae ae ae ae ae ae ae ae ae ae ae ae\n\nj\n\nae ae ae ae ae ae ae\n\nj\n\nFIG. 3. Kinks in the repressilator model. The kink-domain picture provides an alternative\ncharacterization of periodic orbits. Numerical time snapshots in gene space (black dots) are mapped\nonto domains and kinks using Eq. 9 (gray arrows). (a) Frustrated solution in an odd-numbered\n(N=51) gene ring, which emerges from the first Hopf bifurcation and is a stable attractive limit\ncycle. Its stability follows intuitively from the fact that the kink can propagate along the ring\nforever. (b) The solution with two kinks in the even-numbered ring (N=50) is, on the other hand,\nunstable. This solution originates from the first Hopf bifurcation in an even ring. The dynamics\naround this UPO corresponds to the motion of the two kinks along the ring with a slightly different\nspeed. As one kink gains on the other, they eventually annihilate and the ring becomes quiescent.\nImportantly for applications, this happens only after a very large number of periods (\u223c 100).\n\nThe pattern now becomes clear. The cascade of Hopf bifurcations corresponds to the\nemergence of solutions with an increasing number of kinks in the ring. The first Hopf\nbifurcation in even rings corresponds to the emergence of a solution with two traveling\nkinks which can be seen as localized excitations in the ring, as seen in Figure 3b for a\nring of size N = 50. The kinks (or walls) originate from the mis-matching of two 'up-down'\ndomains to give an arrangement that can be fitted into an even ring, as shown at the bottom\nof Figure 2b. As indicated by Floquet analysis, this solution is an unstable periodic orbit\nin which the two kinks get closer as time evolves until they annihilate each other. As the\ntwo kinks conflate, the domain separation unravels and we recover the 'up-down' dimerized\nsolution. Similarly, the second Hopf in odd rings gives rise to UPOs that correspond to\nsolutions containing three traveling kinks, while the second Hopf in even rings leads to the\nemergence of UPOs with four propagating kinks in the ring.\nIt then follows that even numbered rings only admit (unstable) configurations with an\neven number of kinks that eventually annihilate to recover the stable dimerized solution.\nIn odd rings, only solutions with an odd number of kinks are possible and, similarly, all\nthe kinks but one eventually annihilate, leaving a single kink propagating along the ring\nindefinitely, i.e., we recover the stable limit cycle basic solution. Note also that when the\nsolutions correspond to tilings of basic solutions, the total number of kinks is the result of\n12\n\n\fUPOs in the generalized repressilator\nmultiplying the number of kinks of the basic solution by the number of tilings. Moreover, the\nnumber of Hopf bifurcations, which follows from symmetry constraints, is therefore linked\nto the maximum number of kinks that can be accommodated in the rings. A summary of\nthe periodic solutions in Table I is presented in terms of their kink density in Figure 4.\n\n1\u0090N 2\u0090N 3\u0090N 4\u0090N 5\u0090N 6\u0090N 7\u0090N\nae\n\nae\n\nae\n\n15\n\nae\n\nae\n\nae\nae\n\nae\n\nae\n\nae\n\nae\n\nae\n\nae\n\nN\n\nae\n\nae\nae\n\nae\n\n10\n\nae\n\nae\n\nae\nae\n\n8\u0090N\n\nae\n\nae\n\nae\n\nae\n\nae\n\nae\n\nae\n\nae\nae\nae\n\nae\nae\n\n5\n\nae\nae\nae\nae\n\n1\n9\n\n1\n7\n\n1\n5\n\n1\n4\n\n1\n3\n\n3\n7\n\nkink density\nFIG. 4.

For this set of parameters\nthe kink density is always smaller than 1/2. Solutions with the same number of kinks are connected\nby the grey (odd) and pink (even) curves. The solutions of odd-numbered rings appear at the\ncrossings of the grey horizontal lines with the grey curves. Similarly, the intersections of the pink\nhorizontal lines and the pink curves mark the UPOs for even rings. The colored vertical lines\nconnect the families of symmetry tilings (colors matched to those in Table I).\n\nV.\n\nOBSERVABLE LONG-LIVED OSCILLATING TRANSIENTS AROUND\n\nUPOS\nThe kink-domain picture not only provides insight into the existence and structure of\nperiodic solutions, but also gives an intuitive understanding of their stability. As expected,\nthe larger the number of kinks, the more unstable the solutions become. This can be seen\nin the fact that the number of unstable Floquet directions grows as the number of kinks\nincreases: the number of unstable Floquet directions is equal to the number of kinks minus\none (Table I). In addition, the increased instability of the solutions with a large number of\nkinks also translates into a reduced length of the transients observed numerically, i.e., the\ntime it takes for the kinks to conflate decreases as the density of kinks increases. This means\n13\n\n\fUPOs in the generalized repressilator\nthat for practical purposes, the dominant long-lived oscillatory transients will be associated\nwith the UPO emerging from the first Hopf bifurcation in even rings. We show below that\nthe length of the oscillatory transients is long compared to the observation time scales of\nthe system, hence these UPOs dictate the observable dynamics of the system.\n\nSlow convergence to the dimerized solution through kink-kink annihilation\nEven though even rings act as bistable switches at steady state, the UPOs emanating\nfrom the first Hopf in even rings have a strong influence on their observable dynamics. Often,\nwhen starting from any random initial condition, even rings of moderate length get trapped\ninto long-lived oscillating transients before they eventually approach the stable 'up-down'\nsolution. These observed transients in the numerics can be traced to dynamics around the\nfirst unstable UPO, a solution with two kinks in the ring. A typical transient will quickly\nsettle down into a configuration with two kinks separated by a distance that depends on\nthe initial condition. The two kinks then propagate along the ring for a large number of\nperiods, slowly approaching each other, until they annihilate. The dynamics of this long\ntransient is shown in detail in Figure 5 from different perspectives. The very slow slip of\nthe kinks is observable not only through the persistence of the inter-kink distance during\nthe transient (Fig. 5b,d) but also in the phase plot and Poincar\u00e9 sections of the dynamics\n(Fig. 5c,e). In particular, the structure of the phase plot (Fig. 5c) indicates the likelihood\nthat the dynamics of the transient is restricted to a reduced manifold, possibly the unstable\ntorus that emerges from a Neimark-Sacker bifurcation (see Fig. 1c).\n\nObservability of the transient dynamics around UPOs: reachability and\npersistence\nFor the transient dynamics described above to be relevant for applications and design\nit needs to be observable, i.e., it should be reachable from large regions of phase space\nand it should persist over long time scales as compared to the intrinsic time horizon of the\nsystem. Our numerical simulations indicate that the UPOs that emerge from the first Hopf\nbifurcation in even rings (corresponding to the two-kink arrangement) possess these two\nattributes.

In fact, all the oscillatory transients reached\nfrom random initial conditions correspond to the two-kink traveling solution, so this is the\nonly UPO that is observable. Note also that, as expected, the longer the ring, the more\nlikely it is to observe these transients since it is easier for the initial condition to settle onto a\nconfiguration with two well-separated kinks in the ring. This is also seen in Figure 7, where\nwe show the increasing length of the oscillatory transient from a similar initial condition as\nwe increase the length of the ring. These observations explain why although UPOs with\nmore than two kinks are possible in even rings, they are not observed numerically when\nstarting from random initial conditions. Multi-kink solutions are both combinatorially less\nprobable and are more unlikely to settle onto a configuration with well-separated kinks that\n\nICs leading to oscillations\n\ncan persist as a long oscillating transient.\n\u009f > 5 oscillations\n\u00ec > 10 oscillations\n\u00e8 > 50 oscillations\n\n0.6\n0.5\n\n\u00e0\n\u00ec\n\n0.4\n\u00e0\n\u00ec\n\n0.3\n0.2\n\n\u00e0\n\u00ec\nae\n\nae\nae\n\nae\n\n\u00e0\n\u00ec\n\n0.1\n0.0\n\n\u00e0\n\u00ec\n\n\u00e0\n\u00ec\n\n\u00ec\nae\n\u00e0\n\n\u00ec\nae\n\u00e0\n\n5\n\n\u00e0\n\u00ec\nae\n\nae\n\nae\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\nN\n\nFIG. 6. Likelihood of the observability of long transients starting from random initial\nconditions.

The hypercube of\ninitial conditions defined as ([0, mu ] \u00d7 [0, pu ])N has been sampled 104 times for each ring of length\nN . The likelihood of observing long oscillatory transients increases for longer rings.\n\nFigure 8 presents a summary of numerical simulations of a 16-gene ring that explore the\ncharacteristics of the two-kink traveling solution that make it observable. Firstly, random\ninitial conditions settle with high likelihood onto configurations with two kinks separated\nby a distance kd that is large enough to lead to a long-lived transient before annihilation.\nFigure 8a shows the numerically observed proportion of initial conditions that settle onto\nconfigurations with different inter-kink distances. Note that 40% of the initial conditions\nlead to configurations with well-separated kinks (kd = 4, 5, 6) and the probability of reaching\neach of these distances is almost equal.\nAs explained above, there is a relationship between the duration of the transient and\n16\n\n\fUPOs in the generalized repressilator\n\np1\n\nN=6\n\np1\n\nN = 10\n\np1\n\nN = 12\n\ntime\n\nFIG. 7.

These long transients are responsible for the heavy tail of the probability distribution\nof the period lengths presented in Figure 8b, which shows that the probability of observing\na very long transient that oscillates for more than 550 periods is of comparable order to\nobserving the stable 'up-down' fixed point directly.\n\nVI.\n\nCOMPARISON TO OTHER UNIDIRECTIONALLY COUPLED\n\nRINGS: FLUX-GATE MAGNETOMETERS\nThere are several systems with a directed ring topology where UPOs play a significant\nrole in the dynamics. A recent example is the study of UPOs in relation to the emergence of\nchaotic behavior in rings of Duffing oscillators7 . Closest to the dynamics of the gene system\nstudied here are the rings of unidirectionally coupled magnetic cores9 that have been not\nonly studied numerically but also implemented experimentally by Bulsara et al. . In the\nantiferromagnetic case, the system of coupled magnetic cores is described by the following\n17\n\n\f3.8 Discussion\nUPOs in the generalized repressilator\n\n102\n\na\n!60#\" $ !Ttr % \" !5 periods\n!13#\" $ !Ttr % \" 78 periods\n!13#\" $ !Ttr % \" 608 periods\n!14#\" $ !Ttr % \" 1587 periods\n\nkd ! 4\n\nkd \"6\nkd \"5\n\nkd \"4\n\nkd ! 0\nkd ! 1\nkd ! 2\nkd ! 3\nkd ! 4\nkd ! 5\nkd ! 6\n\nlog!counts!Ttr\"\"\n\nb\n\n3.5\n\n! 550\n\n3.0\n2.5\n2.0\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n\n0\n\n50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 550\n\nTtr in periods\n\nFigure\n3.7: Numerical\nanalysis\nof oscillating\ntransients\nstarting\nrandom\ninitial\nFIG.\n8.

(6).\nThe bifurcations branching from the unstable symmetric solution follow from a Jacobian\nof the same form as that in Eq. (7). Hence the UPO characteristics follow the same pattern\nas those of the gene system. For even rings, the system shows symmetry breaking when\nc is increased giving rise first to the two degenerate dimerized solutions followed by the\nemergence of UPOs from the now unstable symmetric branch. For odd rings, there is also a\nsimilar cascade of Hopf bifurcations. The maximal number of Hopf bifurcations due to ring\nsymmetry is (N/2 \u2212 1) for even-numbered rings and (N \u2212 1)/2 for odd-numbered rings, as\nis the case for the generalized repressilator model.\nSuch rings of magnetic cores have been implemented as real-world devices and the oddnumbered versions are used as sensitive magnetic sensors. Long even-numbered rings have\nalso been built and their dynamics has been explored under noise perturbations and under\nrandom initial conditions13 . It turns out that long oscillatory transients feature heavily in\nlong even-numbered rings, even if the steady state is quiescent13 .\n\nVII.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe relevant dynamics of noisy systems with a limited horizon of observability is not\nalways well defined by their long-term attractors as given by stability analysis. In such\nsystems, long-lived transients can de facto dominate the observable behavior. Examples of\nsuch behavior are prevalent in a variety of engineering, physical and biological systems21,27,28 .\nIn this paper, we have analyzed the dynamics of the generalized repressilator model and have\ncharacterized the existence of long-lived oscillatory transients in even rings-systems that\nwould otherwise be expected to behave as bistable switches based on strict stability analysis.\nThese transients correspond to slowly decaying dynamics around particular unstable periodic\norbits (UPOs) that emerge as part of a cascade of Hopf bifurcations. The UPOs have spatiotemporal symmetries that can be understood in terms of tilings and propagating kinks,\ncorresponding to the moving walls separating different domains of the stable dimerized\nsolution. In particular, the most probable long-lived observable transients correspond to\npropagation of kink pairs along the ring. We showed numerically that in the presence of such\n19\n\n\fUPOs in the generalized repressilator\nUPOs the dynamics of the system is funneled to its vicinity onto a constrained manifold from\nwhich it is difficult to escape, thus leading to observable very long-lived transient oscillations\nof hundreds of periods when starting from random initial conditions. The likelihood of such\nbehavior can be understood from the fact that when a pair of kinks is well separated, they\nwill propagate along the ring for a long time until they conflate to restore the fixed point\nsolution. This process results in a heavy-tailed distribution of the duration of oscillatory\ntransients.\nThe gene rings analyzed here present analogies with other systems from classical physics,\nsuch as domain wall propagation in antiferromagnetic media or kink propagation in dimerized polymer chains, and is mathematically connected with classical models of nonlinear\nwave propagation in one-dimensional discrete lattices. However, most of previous models\nare based on undirected (bidirectional) coupling. Directed ring topologies with a coupling\nfunction that is bounded, monotonic and with a strong enough nonlinearity can lead to the\nemergence of UPOs with the right values of the coupling strength4,19 . These UPOs can then\npotentially lead to observable long-lived oscillating transients. Recent studies have shown\nthe importance of UPOs in similar directed ring systems, both as originators of transients\nin the route to chaos in rings of Duffing oscillators7 and in the emergence of long-lived oscillatory transients in experimental even-numbered rings of magnetic cores13 . The linear\nstability analysis and the cascade of UPOs is similar in all those systems and follows from\nfundamental symmetry arguments4 . However, the reachability and persistence of the transient dynamics depends on the particular form of the coupling function and reflects global\nfeatures of the flow in phase space that funnel the dynamics around the oscillatory behavior. Based on our interpretation in terms of kink propagation, it is likely that increasing the\nnonlinearity of the coupling function (while keeping it bounded and monotonic) will increase\nthe likelihood of localized excitations. Hence, the existence of long-lived transients based\non the propagation of kink pairs will become more likely. In the case of genetic circuits,\nthis can be achieved by increasing the Hill coefficient h of the repressor. This can be done\nby the selection of particular gene promoters based on biochemical mechanisms with higher\ncooperativity.\nThe design of topologically constrained systems is widely used in classical engineering and\napplied physics as an aid to controllable dynamics. The generic properties of such systems,\nwhich follow from fundamental results from group theory and dynamical systems4 , provides\n20\n\n\fUPOs in the generalized repressilator\na good chance that the key underlying properties could survive under hardly predictable\nand classifiable biological environments. In this case, the symmetry of the ring arrangement\nleads to a strongly symmetric bifurcation analysis and also informs our understanding of the\nspatio-temporal solutions in terms of tilings and domain walls. However these topological\nconsiderations require that the elements in the ring be strictly identical. In real systems this\ncondition is not fulfilled and the question remains if UPOs are dynamically observable when\nthe individual elements are dissimilar, both in numerical simulations and in real-world built\nsystems. The implementation of the ring of magnetic cores by Lindner and Bulsara 13 suggests that UPOs do feature in real-world applications. Our numerical analysis in Strelkowa\nand Barahona 21 showed that UPOs are also observable in gene repressilator rings when\nthe genes are not identical. They also feature heavily in the dynamics when the system is\nfundamentally stochastic, i.e., in the equivalent Markov process (Master equation). Such\nrobustness allowed us to introduce the concept of a switchable synthetic genetic oscillator,\noperating under uncertainty and noise, based on the feedback operation around the UPOs\nassociated with the long-lived transients. These examples and others indicate that the conceptual design based on simplified designs can still lead to a fundamental understanding,\nalthough system-specific characterizations in the presence of noise and uncertainty are essential when applications to be considered. Such a perspective is of a potential value to provide\nideas for transferable design unifying several disciplines, ranging from electrical engineering\nto synthetic biology.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nN.S. gratefully acknowledges support from the Wellcome Trust through grant 080711/Z/06/Z.\nWe thank Andreas Ipsen, Kim Parker and Guy-Bart Stan for discussions.\n\nAppendix A: Analytical conditions for the number of Hopf bifurcations\nProperties of the nonlinear coupling functions and the length of the ring N all determine how many Hopf bifurcations and which UPOs are expected for a given parameter set\n{c1 , c2 , c3 , c4 } of the generalized repressilator model.\nConsider the case with the Hill repressor function (Eq. 2).
