If T : (X, \u03bc) \u2192\n(X, \u03bc) is a p.m.p. (probability measure-preserving) transformation of a standard probability\nspace (X, \u03bc) then for any f \u2208 L1 (X, \u03bc), the averages\nn\n\nAn [f ] :=\n\n1 X\nf \u25e6T\nn + 1 i=0\n\nconverge pointwise a.e. to E[f |I], the conditional expectation of f on the sigma-algebra\nI of T -invariant Borel subsets. Convergence in L1 -norm had been proven earlier by von\nNeumann [vN32]. This theorem has been extended in many different directions (see e.g.\n[Kr85, Te92, As03]). Our focus here is on the possibility of replacing the semi-group {T i }i\u22650\nwith a general locally compact group (see the survey [Ne05] for further information).\nLet G be a locally compact second countable group with a p.m.p. action on a probability\nspace (X, \u03bc). Any Borel probability measure \u03b2 on G determines an operator on L1 (X, \u03bc)\ndefined by\nZ\n\u03b2(f ) := f \u25e6 g d\u03b2(g), \u2200f \u2208 L1 (X, \u03bc).\n\nDefinition 1.1. Let I denote either R>0 or N. Suppose {\u03b2r }r\u2208I is a family of probability\nmeasures on G. If for every p.m.p. action G y (X, \u03bc) and every f \u2208 Lp (X, \u03bc) the functions\n\u03b2r (f ) converge as r \u2192 \u221e pointwise a.e. to the conditional expectation of f on the \u03c3-algebra\nof G-invariant Borel sets then {\u03b2r }r\u2208I is a pointwise ergodic family in Lp .\nSince the time of von-Neumann and Birkhoff, much of the effort in ergodic theory has\nbeen devoted to actions of amenable groups. We turn to describe some of the main ergodic\ntheorems established for them, and then some of those established in the non-amenable case.\n1.1.1\n\nAmenable groups.\n\nA locally compact second countable (lcsc) group G is amenable if it admits a sequence\n|QFn \u2206Fn |\nF = {Fn }\u221e\n=0\nn=1 of compact subsets such that for every compact Q \u2282 G, limn\u2192\u221e\n|Fn |\nwhere |*| denotes left Haar measure. Such a sequence is called F\u00f8lner or asymptotically\ninvariant.\nA F\u00f8lner sequence is doubling if it is monotone; namely Fn \u2282 Fn+1 and satisfies the\nvolume doubling bound, namely there is a constant Cd > 0, such that for every n > 0\nF\u22121\nn Fn \u2264 Cd |Fn |.\n3\n\n\fThis condition generalizes the doubling condition introduced by Wiener [Wi39] and Calderon\n[Ca53], who proved that doubling F\u00f8lner sequences are pointwise ergodic in L1 .\nA F\u00f8lner sequence is regular if there is a constant Creg > 0 such that for every n > 0\n[\nF\u22121\ni Fn \u2264 Creg |Fn |.\ni\u2264n\n\nThe fact that regular F\u00f8lner sequences are pointwise ergodic sequences in L1 was established by Tempelman [Te72, Te92], and also by Bewley [Be71], Chatard [Ch70] and Emerson\n[Em74].\nA F\u00f8lner sequence is tempered if there is a constant C > 0 such that for every n > 0,\n[\n\ni<n\n\nF\u22121\ni Fn \u2264 C|Fn |.\n\nIt was shown by E. Lindenstrauss in [Li01] that every F\u00f8lner sequence has a tempered\nsubsequence and every tempered F\u00f8lner sequence is a pointwise ergodic sequence in L1 . This\nis the most general result to date for arbitrary amenable groups. An alternative proof was\ngiven by B. Weiss in [We03]. The notion of temperedness was introduced and the L2 -case\nwas proven earlier by Shulman [Sh88, Te92].\nLet us mention that besides the asymptotic invariance inherent in the definition of a\nF\u00f8lner sequence, there are two other essential ingredients that appear in the proofs of each\nof the pointwise results stated above. One is a case-appropriate generalization of the Wiener\ncovering argument originally proved for ball averages on Euclidean space, which leads to a\nweak-type (1, 1) maximal inequality for averaging on the sets Fn in the group. The other is\nthe Calderon transference principle, which reduces the maximal inequality in a general action\nto the maximal inequality for convolutions on the group itself. In our discussion below, we\nwill seek to generalize these ingredients beyond the case of actions of amenable groups.\n1.1.2\n\nNon-amenable groups.\n\nThe question of a possible generalization of ergodic theorems to arbitrary finitely generated\ngroups was raised already half a century ago by Arnol'd and Krylov. In [AK63] they have\ngeneralized Weyl's equidistribution theorem from dense free groups of rotations of the unit\ncircle to dense free groups of rotations on the unit sphere. This result motivated the generalization of von-Neumann's mean ergodic theorem from the free group on one generator to\nthe free group on any finite number of generators, established by Y. Guivarc'h [Gu68] using\nspectral theory.\nErgodic theorems for measure-preserving actions of arbitrary countable groups were obtained by Oseledets in 1965 [Os65]: he showed that convolution powers of a symmetric\nprobability measure on \u0393 form a pointwise ergodic family.\nSemisimple S-algebraic groups. Techniques based on the spectral theory of unitary representations have been developed and applied to the case where G is a connected\nsemisimple Lie group in [Ne94a, Ne94b, NS94, Ne97, NS97, MNS00]. The more general case\n4\n\n\fof semisimple S-algebraic group, and furthermore any lattice subgroup of such a group was\nestablished in [GN10], to which we refer for a more detailed account. Typically, the averaging sequences studied are the uniform averages over concentric balls (and in some cases,\nspheres) centered at the origin. As an example, we mention that the free group was handled\nin [Ne94a, NS94] by viewing it as a lattice in the group of automorphisms of a regular tree,\nand in [GN10] as a lattice in P SL2 (R).\nAn important feature of the spectral methods is that the ergodic theorems derived from\nthem often exhibit a rate of convergence to the ergodic mean, a phenomenon that cannot\narise in the classical amenable context. Thus, when available, spectral methods give results\nfar sharper than any other technique, but their scope is limited to groups whose unitary\nrepresentations are well-understood, and to their lattice subgroups.\nMarkov groups. A most elegant proof of the pointwise ergodic theorem for the free\ngroup with respect to spherical averages was given in [Bu00], using Markov operators techniques developed in [Ro62]. This approach to the ergodic theorem was inspired by earlier\nrelated ideas in [Gr99]. These techniques extend to a certain extent to groups with a Markov\npresentation which includes all Gromov-hyperbolic groups. For example, in [BKK11] it is\nproven that Cesaro averages of spherical averages converge in L1 for every Gromov hyperbolic group with respect to an arbitrary word metric. The identification of the limit function\nas the ergodic average has recently been obtained in the case of surface groups in [BS10].\n\n1.2\n\nFrom amenable groups to amenable equivalence relations\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to introduce a general approach for proving pointwise ergodic\ntheorems for countable groups \u0393. This approach has the remarkable feature that it treats\namenable and non-amenable groups on an equal footing, and in fact constitutes a direct\ngeneralization of the classical techniques of amenable ergodic theory which applies also to\nnon-amenable groups. The two main ideas are as follows. First, we will show that it is\npossible to reduce the proof of ergodic theorems in measure-preserving \u0393-actions (X, \u03bc) to\nthe proof of ergodic theorems in certain associated amenable probability-measure-preserving\nequivalence relations. The amenable equivalence relations are obtained by first choosing\nan amenable action of \u0393, typically a Poisson boundary (B, \u03bd), considering its extension\n(X \u00d7 B, \u03bc \u00d7 \u03bd) by the measure-preserving \u0393-action, and then constructing a probabilitymeasure-preserving amenable sub-relation of the Maharam extension of X \u00d7 B. Second,\nwe will show that it is possible to establish ergodic theorems along F\u00f8lner sets in p.m.p.\namenable equivalence relations, directly generalizing the classical arguments. Thus when\nthe F\u00f8lner sequence in the equivalence relation is doubling we proceed by generalizing the\narguments of Wiener and Calderon, or more generally of Tempelman for regular sequences\nin amenable groups. When the F\u00f8lner sequence in the equivalence relation is tempered,\nwe proceed by generalizing Weiss' proof of Lindenstrauss' theorem [We03] for tempered\nsequences in amenable groups. This is accomplished in \u00a72.\n\n5\n\n\f1.3\n\nStatement of one main result\n\nNext we present one of our main results, with more refined results given later on in the text\n(specifically, Theorems 4.1, 4.2 and 5.2). Undefined terminology is explained immediately\nfollowing the statement of the theorem.\nTheorem 1.1. Let \u0393 y (B, \u03bd) be a measure class preserving action of a countable group\non a standard probability space. We assume the action is essentially free, weakly mixing and\nstable type III1 . Let \u03b8 be the measure on R given by d\u03b8(t) = et dt. Let \u0393 y (B \u00d7 R, \u03bd \u00d7 \u03b8) by\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0013\nd\u03bd \u25e6 g \u22121\ng(b, t) = gb, t + log\n(b)\n.\nd\u03bd\nLet T > 0 be arbitrary, I = [0, T ], and \u03b8I be the probability measure on [0, T ] given by d\u03b8I (t) =\net\ndt. Let RI be the equivalence relation on B \u00d7 I given by restricting the orbit equivalence\neT \u22121\nrelation on B \u00d7 R (so RI consists of all ((b, t), g(b, t)) with g \u2208 \u0393 and (b, t), g(b, t) \u2208 B \u00d7 I).\nLet F = {Fr }r\u2208I be a Borel family of subset functions for (B \u00d7 I, \u03bd \u00d7 \u03b8I , RI ).

Essential freeness of the action \u0393 y (B, \u03bd)\nmeans that for a.e. b \u2208 B the stability group {g \u2208 \u0393 : gx = x} is trivial. By an amenable\naction we mean an action amenable in the sense of Zimmer [Zi78]. Alternatively, by [CFW81]\nthis is equivalent to the existence of a Borel transformation S : B \u2192 B such that for a.e.\nb \u2208 B, \u0393b = {S i b : i \u2208 Z}. Weakly mixing means that if \u0393 y (X, \u03bc) is any ergodic\np.m.p.

So it is\nnatural to ask, when does such an action exist and how can we find one?\nFirst we note that the requirement that the action be essentially free is not very restrictive\nin the sense that if there is an action satisfying the other conditions then there is an essentially\nfree action which satisfies all the conditions. To explain, let \u0393 y (X, \u03bc) be any essentially\nfree, weakly mixing, probability-measure-preserving action (for example, Bernoulli actions\nsatisfy this property). If \u0393 y (B, \u03bd) is weakly mixing, amenable, type III\u03bb and stable type\nIII\u03c4 (for some \u03bb, \u03c4 \u2208 [0, 1]) then the product action \u0393 y (X \u00d7B, \u03bc\u00d7\u03bd) is also weakly mixing,\namenable, type III\u03bb and stable type III\u03c4 . Moreover the product action is essentially free.\nNow given a symmetric probability measure \u03bc on \u0393, we may consider the Poisson boundary (B, \u03bd) for the random walk with \u03bc-distributed increments. There is a natural action of \u0393\n7\n\n\fon (B, \u03bd) which is always amenable [Zi78] and weakly mixing [AL05]. It is not known whether\nthis action is always type III\u03bb for some \u03bb \u2208 (0, 1] or whether by choosing \u03bc appropriately\none can always require the action to be type III\u03bb for some \u03bb \u2208 (0, 1]. However, under extra\nhypotheses on \u0393, we do have some answers. We establish in \u00a74.4 that all irreducible lattices\nin connected semisimple Lie groups without compact factors have the property that their\naction on the Poisson boundary B = G/P has stable type III1 . It was shown in [INO08]\nthat Poisson boundaries of Gromov hyperbolic groups are never type III0 .\nIn future work [BN2] we intend to show that if \u0393 is Gromov hyperbolic then the action\non its boundary with respect to the Patterson-Sullivan measure is weakly mixing, amenable,\ntype III\u03bb and stable type III\u03c4 for some \u03bb, \u03c4 \u2208 (0, 1]. We will use this in [BN2] to obtain\npointwise ergodic sequences {\u03b6r }\u221e\nr=1 for general Gromov hyperbolic groups \u0393, such that each\n\u03b6r is supported in a spherical shell of constant width.\nWe conjecture that any countable group admits an action satisfying all the requirements\nabove. If true, then the results of this paper apply to all countable groups.\n\n1.5\n\nOrganization of the paper\n\nIn \u00a72 we prove ergodic theorems for amenable equivalence relations. In \u00a73 we prove maximal\nergodic theorems. In \u00a74 we use results of the previous two sections to prove pointwise ergodic\ntheorems when \u0393 y (B, \u03bd) has stable type III1 . In \u00a75 we prove pointwise ergodic theorems\nwhen \u0393 y (B, \u03bd) has type III\u03bb and stable type III\u03c4 for \u03bb, \u03c4 \u2208 (0, 1).\n\nAcknowledgement\nThe authors would like to thank the (anonymous) referee for many useful comments, which\nresulted in significant improvements to the presentation.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nErgodic theorems for amenable equivalence relations\nDefinition of F\u00f8lner sets and their properties\n\nA measured equivalence relation is a quadruple (X, B, \u03bc, R) where (X, B, \u03bc) is a standard\n\u03c3-finite measure space and R \u2282 X \u00d7 X is a Borel equivalence relation. It is discrete if every\nequivalence class, denoted [x], is at most countable. It is a probability-measured equivalence\nrelation if \u03bc(X) = 1. To reduce notation, we will usually omit the sigma-algebra from the\nnotation and say that (X, \u03bc, R) is a measured equivalence relation.\nLet c denote counting measure on X (so c(E) = #E \u2200E \u2282 X). The measure \u03bc on X\nis R-invariant if \u03bc \u00d7 c restricted to R equals c \u00d7 \u03bc restricted to R. In this case we say\n(X, \u03bc, R) is a measure-preserving equivalence relation. A Borel map \u03c8 : X \u2192 X is an inner\nautomorphism of R if it is invertible with Borel inverse and its graph is contained in R. Let\nInn(R) denote the group of inner automorphisms. This group is frequently called the full\ngroup and denoted by [R]. If \u03bc is R-invariant then \u03c8\u2217 \u03bc = \u03bc for every \u03c8 \u2208 Inn(R). For the\n8\n\n\frest of this section, we assume (X, \u03bc, R) is a discrete probability measure-preserving (p.m.p.)\nequivalence relation.\nA subset function (for R) is a map U on X such that U(x) \u2282 [x] for all x \u2208 X. The\ninverse of U is the subset function U\u22121 (y) := {x \u2208 X : y \u2208 U(x)}. If U1 , U2 are two subset\nfunctions then their product U1 U2 is the subset function defined by\n[\nU1 U2 (x) := {U1 (y) : y \u2208 U2 (x)}.\n\nTheir difference U1 \\ U2 is defined by U1 \\ U2 (x) := U1 (x) \\ U2 (x). We write U1 \u2282 U2 if\nU1 (x) \u2282 U2 (x) for a.e. x. If {Ui }i\u2208I is a family of subset functions their union \u222ai\u2208I Ui is the\nsubset function defined by\n[\n(\u222ai\u2208I Ui )(x) :=\nUi (x).\ni\u2208I\n\nA Borel family of subset functions F = {Fr }r\u2208I (for R) is a family of subset functions\nFr indexed by a set I \u2208 {N, R>0 } such that {(x, y, r) \u2208 X \u00d7 X \u00d7 I : y \u2208 Fr (x)} is a Borel\nsubset of R \u00d7 I. As noted already, we will always assume\nS that \u222as\u2264r Fs (x) \u2282 [x] is finite for\nevery x \u2208 X and r \u2208 I. As a result we also have that t\u2264r F\u22121\nt Fr (x) is finite for every r \u2208 I\nand every x \u2208 X.\nLet F be a Borel family of subset functions. The definitions below generalize classical\nconcepts.\n1. A set \u03a8 \u2282 Inn(R) generates R with respect to \u03bc if for \u03bc \u00d7 c a.e. (x1 , x2 ) \u2208 R there\nexists \u03c8 \u2208 h\u03a8i such that \u03c8(x1 ) = xS2 (where h\u03a8i denotes the subgroup of Inn(R)\ngenerated by \u03a8). Equivalently R = \u03c8\u2208h\u03a8i Graph (\u03c8), up to a set of \u03bc \u00d7 c measure\nzero.\n2. F is asymptotically invariant if |Fr (x)| \u2265 1 for a.e. x \u2208 X and r \u2208 I and there exists\na countable set \u03a8 \u2282 Inn(R) which generates R such that for every \u03c8 \u2208 \u03a8 and \u03bc-a.e.\nx\u2208X\n|Fr (x)\u2206\u03c8(Fr (x))|\nlim\n= 0.\nr\u2192\u221e\n|Fr (x)|\nWe say that F is F\u00f8lner if it is asymptotically invariant.\n3. F is uniform if there are constants Cu , ar , br > 0 (for r \u2208 I) such that\n(a) br \u2264 Cu ar for every r \u2208 I,\n(b) ar \u2264 |Fr (x)| \u2264 br for a.e. x \u2208 X,\n(c) ar \u2264 |F\u22121\nr (x)| \u2264 br for a.e. x \u2208 X.\nThe constant Cu is called the uniformity constant.\n\n4. F is doubling if (i) F is a monotone family namely for s < r we have Fs (x) \u2282 Fr (x)\na.e., and (ii) F satisfies the volume doubling bound, namely there is a constant Cd > 0,\ncalled the doubling constant, such that for \u03bc-a.e. x \u2208 X and every r > 0\nFr (x)\u22121 Fr (x) \u2264 Cd |Fr (x)|.\n9\n\n\f5.

For a Borel function f \u2208 L1 (X), let E[f |I(R)] denote the\nconditional expectation of f with respect to the \u03c3-algebra I(R) of R-invariant measurable\nsets.\n\n2.2\n\nStatement of ergodic theorems for equivalence relations\n\nKeeping the notation introduced in \u00a72.1, in \u00a72.3 - \u00a72.6 we prove the following results :\nTheorem 2.1. If F is either (asymptotically invariant and regular) or (asymptotically invariant, uniform and tempered) then F is a (restricted) pointwise ergodic family in L1 . Namely,\nfor every f \u2208 L1 (X, \u03bc), A[f |Fr ] converges pointwise a.e. to E[f |I(R)] as r \u2192 \u221e.\nTheorem 2.5 below extends Theorem 2.1 and shows that in fact F is an (unrestricted)\npointwise ergodic family in L1 , namely that the result passes to class-bijective ergodic extensions. This will be established in \u00a72.6.\nOur method of proof of Theorem 2.1 follows the classical pattern and is based on the\nnext two theorems.\nTheorem 2.2 (Dense subset of good functions). If F is asymptotically invariant then there\nexists a dense subset G \u2282 L1 (X) such that for all f \u2208 G, A[f |Fr ] converges pointwise a.e.\nto E[f |I(R)] as r \u2192 \u221e. Moreover, if L10 (X) is the set of all functions f \u2208 L1 (X) with\nE[f |I(R)] = 0 a.e. then there exists a dense subset G0 \u2282 L10 (X) such that for all f \u2208 G0 ,\nA[f |Fr ] converges pointwise a.e. to 0 as r \u2192 \u221e.\nFor f \u2208 L1 (X), let M[f |F] = supr\u2208I A[|f ||Fr ] where |f | denotes the absolute value of f .\nM[*|F] is the maximal operator associated to the family {A[*|Fr ]}r\u2208I . As we shall see below\nin the proof of the maximal inequality, the maximal function M[*|F] is Borel measurable,\neven when the index set I = R. We can now state\n10\n\n\fTheorem 2.3 (Weak (1, 1)-type maximal inequality). Suppose that F is either regular or\n(asymptotically invariant, uniform and tempered). Then there exists a constant C > 0 such\nthat for any f \u2208 L1 (X) and any \u03bb > 0,\n\u03bc ({x \u2208 X : M[f |F] > \u03bb}) \u2264\n\nC||f ||1\n.\n\u03bb\n\nIn fact C can be taken to be 8Cu4 (1 + Ct Cu ) in the tempered case and Creg in the regular case.\nTheorem 2.4 below extends Theorem 2.3 to arbitrary class-bijective extensions of (X, \u03bc, R).\nWe recall that the concept of an amenable group action has been defined in great generality in [Zi78], and several characterizations of this property have been established, including\nin [CFW81]. We will not elaborate here on these results, since they are not directly relevant\nto our discussion. Instead, we will just note that it has been shown in [Zi78] that the Poisson boundary associated with a non-degenerate random walk on \u0393 is an amenable ergodic\naction of \u0393 (but it still an open problem whether the type can be III0 ). Furthermore, in\n[CFW81] is was shown that amenability of a general equivalence relation is equivalent to\nthe existence of an asymptotically invariant sequence of subset functions (defined taking\nthe Radon-Nikodym derivative into account). Focusing on the case of p.m.p. equivalence\nrelations, which is our main concern, let us formulate a general existence result for doubling\nF\u00f8lner sequences, based on another important fact from [CFW81], namely that amenability\nof an equivalence relation is equivalent to the relation being the orbit relation of a Z-action,\nas follows.\nProposition 2.1. Let (X, B, \u03bc, R) be an amenable discrete p.m.p. equivalence relation.\nThen there exists a sequence F = {Fn }\u221e\nn=1 of subset functions which is asymptotically invariant, uniform and doubling.\nProof. Without loss of generality, we may assume (X, B, \u03bc, R) is ergodic. If X is finite then\nwe may choose Fn (x) = X for every n, x. So let us assume X is infinite. According to\n[CFW81, Dy59, Dy63], there exists a measure-preserving Borel transformation T : X \u2192 X\nso that R = {(x, T i x) : x \u2208 X, i \u2208 Z} (up to a \u03bc \u00d7 c-measure zero subset). Then we may let\nFn (x) := {T i x : |i| \u2264 n}. It is easy to check that F = {Fn }\u221e\nn=1 is asymptotically invariant,\nuniform and doubling.\n\n2.3\n\nDense set of good functions\n\nIn this subsection, we prove Theorem 2.2. So assume F is asymptotically invariant. Let\n\u03a8 \u2282 Inn(R) be a countable set generating the relation R that witnesses the asymptotic\ninvariance.\nLemma 2.2.

Let G \u2282 L2 (X) be the space of all\nfunctions of the form f \u2212 f \u25e6 \u03c8 for f \u2208 L\u221e (X) and \u03c8 \u2208 h\u03a8i. We claim that the span of\nI and G is dense in L2 (X). To see this, let f\u2217 be a function in the orthocomplement of G.\nDenoting the L2 inner product by h*, *i, we have\n0 = hf\u2217 , f \u2212 f \u25e6 \u03c8i = hf\u2217 , f i \u2212 hf\u2217 , f \u25e6 \u03c8i = hf\u2217 , f i \u2212 hf\u2217 \u25e6 \u03c8 \u22121 , f i = hf\u2217 \u2212 f\u2217 \u25e6 \u03c8 \u22121 , f i\nfor any f \u2208 L\u221e (X) and \u03c8 \u2208 h\u03a8i. Since L\u221e (X) is dense in L2 (X), we have f\u2217 = f\u2217 \u25e6 \u03c8 \u22121\nfor all \u03c8 \u2208 h\u03a8i. So the previous lemma implies f\u2217 is R-invariant; i.e., f\u2217 \u2208 I. This implies\nI + G is dense in L2 (X) as claimed.\nBy Lemma 2.3 for every f \u2208 I + G, A[f |Fr ] converges pointwise a.e. to E[f |I(R)]. Since\nI + G is dense in L2 (X), which is dense in L1 (X), the first statement follows. The second is\nsimilar.\n\n2.4\n\nMaximal inequality: the regular case\n\nTo prove the maximal inequality for a regular F\u00f8lner family, we begin with the following\nbasic covering argument, motivated by the classical case.\nLemma 2.5. Suppose F satisfies the regularity condition with constant Creg > 0. Let \u03c1 : Y \u2192\nI be a bounded measurable function where Y \u2282 X is Borel. Then there exists a measurable\nset Z \u2282 Y such that the family of sets F\u03c1(z) (z), z \u2208 Z satisfy\n1. for all z1 6= z2 \u2208 Z, F\u03c1(z1 ) (z1 ) \u2229 F\u03c1(z2 ) (z2 ) = \u2205, namely the family is disjoint ;\n2. The union of the sets in the family covers at least a fixed fraction of the measure of Y :\n\u0010[\n\u0011\nCreg \u03bc\nF\u03c1(z) (z) \u2265 \u03bc(Y ) .\nz\u2208Z\n\nProof. Let T : X \u2192 R be an injective Borel function. We will use T to break 'ties' in what\nfollows.\nIf Y \u2032 \u2282 Y is a Borel set then we let M(Y \u2032 ) \u2282 Y \u2032 be the set of all 'maximal' elements of\nY \u2032 . Precisely, y1 \u2208 M(Y \u2032 ) if y1 \u2208 Y \u2032 and for all y2 \u2208 Y \u2032 different from y1 either\n1. F\u03c1(y1 ) (y1 ) \u2229 F\u03c1(y2 ) (y2) = \u2205,\n2. \u03c1(y1 ) > \u03c1(y2 ) or\n3. F\u03c1(y1 ) (y1 ) \u2229 F\u03c1(y2 ) (y2) 6= \u2205, \u03c1(y1 ) = \u03c1(y2 ) and T (y1) > T (y2).\nBecause \u03c1 is bounded, the equivalence relation has countable classes, and F is regular it\nfollows that for any y1 , the set of y2 with F\u03c1(y1 ) (y1 ) \u2229 F\u03c1(y2 ) (y2 ) 6= \u2205 is finite. Thus in case\n3) there exists a point y1 with T (y1 ) maximal, so that if Y \u2032 is non-empty then M(Y \u2032 ) is\nnonempty.\n13\n\n\fLet Y0 := Y and M0 := M(Y0 ). Assuming that Yn , Mn \u2282 Y have been defined, let\nYn+1 := {y \u2208 Y : F\u03c1(y) (y) \u2229 F\u03c1(z) (z) = \u2205 \u2200z \u2208 Mn }\nand Mn+1 := M(Yn+1 ).

Suppose that F is regular with regularity constant Creg > 0. Then for any\nf \u2208 L1 (X) and any t > 0,\n\u03bc ({x \u2208 X : M[f |F] > t}) \u2264\n14\n\nCreg ||f ||1\n.\nt\n\n\fProof.

Hence\nMn [f |F](x) is measurable, and since M[f |F](x) = limn\u2192\u221e Mn [f |F](x), so is the M[f |F](x).\nLet now Dn,t := {x \u2208 X : Mn [f |F](x) > t}. It suffices to show that \u03bc(Dn,t ) \u2264 Cregt||f ||1\nfor each n > 0.\nLet \u03c1 : Dn,t \u2192 I be a Borel function such that A[|f ||F\u03c1(x) ](x) > t and \u03c1(x) \u2264 n \u2200x \u2208 Dn,t .\nLet Z \u2282 Dn,t be the subset given by the previous lemma where Y = Dn,t .

The previous lemma implies \u03bc(Dn,t ) \u2264 Creg \u03bc(Z).\nThe disjointness property of Z implies that for every z \u2208 Ze there exists a unique element\n\u03c0(z) \u2208 Z with z \u2208 F\u03c1(\u03c0(z)) (\u03c0(z)).

If F is uniform and asymptotically invariant then for every \u03c6 \u2208 Inn(R),\nZ\n|Fr (x)\u2206\u03c6(Fr (x))|\nlim\nd\u03bc(x) = 0.\nr\u2192\u221e\n|Fr (x)|\nProof. Because\n|Fr (x)\u2206\u03c6(Fr (x))| = |Fr (x) \\ \u03c6(Fr (x))| + |\u03c6(Fr (x)) \\ Fr (x)|\n= |Fr (x) \\ \u03c6(Fr (x))| + |Fr (x) \\ \u03c6\u22121 (Fr (x))|\nand \u03c6 \u2208 Inn(R) is arbitrary, it suffices to show\nZ\n|Fr (x) \\ \u03c6(Fr (x))|\nlim\nd\u03bc(x) = 0.\nr\u2192\u221e\n|Fr (x)|\nLet \u03a8 \u2282 Inn(R) be a countable generating set witnessing the asymptotic invariance.

(x, y) \u2208 R, there is a \u03c8 \u2208 \u03a8 such that\n\u03c8(x) = y. Because \u03a8 is countable, this implies that there is a Borel partition {Xi }\u221e\ni=1 of X\nand elements \u03c8i \u2208 \u03a8 such that \u03c6(x) = \u03c8i (x) for a.e. x \u2208 Xi .\nLet \u01eb > 0. Choose N > 0 so that \u03bc(\u222aN\ni=1 Xi ) \u2265 1 \u2212 \u01eb. Let Y = \u222ai>N Xi , so \u03bc(Y ) \u2264 \u01eb.\nLet U be the subset function U(x) = {\u03c8i (x) ; 1 \u2264 i \u2264 N }. Recall that we have defined in\n\u00a72.1 the product of two arbitrary subset functions, and therefore the expression UFr (x) =\n{\u03c8i (y) ; y \u2208 Fr (x), 1 \u2264 i \u2264 N} makes sense and is also a subset function.

The second to last inequality above follows from\nLemma 2.7. Since \u01eb > 0 is arbitrary, this implies the lemma.\nWe can formulate the following useful fact which will be used in the proof of the maximal\ninequality in the tempered case.\nLemma 2.9.

Let E = {(x, y) \u2208 R : x \u2208 U(y) or y \u2208 U(x)}. Because U is bounded, this a bounded\ndegree graph. By [KST99], this implies that the Borel edge-chromatic number of (X, E) is\nfinite. That is, there exists a Borel map \u03b1 : E \u2192 A (where A is a finite set) such that if\n(x, y), (y, z) \u2208 E and x 6= z then \u03b1((x, y)) 6= \u03b1((y, z)). We can also assume without loss of\ngenerality that \u03b1(x, y) = \u03b1(y, x).\nFor each element a \u2208 A, define \u03c6a : X \u2192 X as follows. If x \u2208 X and there is a y 6= x\nsuch that (x, y) \u2208 E and \u03b1(x, y) = a then define \u03c6a (x) = y and \u03c6a (y) = x. Otherwise, let\n\u03c6a (x) = x.

We will\nassume the action is essentially free, amenable, weakly mixing and stable type III\u03bb for some\n\u03bb > 0. From these assumptions and a choice of F\u00f8lner sequence for a certain associated\namenable equivalence relation, we will obtain in \u00a73.1 - \u00a73.4 a family of pointwise ergodic\nsequences for \u0393.\nLet us begin by explaining the terms mentioned above. Essentially free means that for\na.e. b \u2208 B the stability group {g \u2208 \u0393 : gx = x} is trivial. By amenable action we mean\namenability in the sense of Zimmer [Zi78]. Weakly mixing means that if \u0393 y (X, \u03bc) is\nany ergodic p.m.p. (probability-measure-preserving) action then the product action \u0393 y\n(B \u00d7 X, \u03bd \u00d7 \u03bc) is ergodic. We now turn to define the (new) notion of stable type.\n\n28\n\n\f4.1\n\nThe stable ratio set\n\nLet \u0393 be a countable group and (B, \u03bd) a standard probability space on which \u0393 acts by nonsingular transformations. The ratio set of the Radon-Nikodym cocycle is a set RS(\u0393, B, \u03bd) \u2282\n[0, +\u221e] defined as follows: a finite number r \u2208 RS(\u0393, B, \u03bd) if and only if for every positive\nmeasure set A \u2282 B and \u01eb > 0 there is a subset A\u2032 \u2282 A of positive measure and an element\ng \u2208 \u0393 \\ {e} such that\n1. gA\u2032 \u2282 A,\n2. | d\u03bd\u25e6g\n(b) \u2212 r| < \u01eb for every b \u2208 A\u2032 .\nd\u03bd\nThe extended real number +\u221e \u2208 RS(\u0393, B, \u03bd) if and only if for every positive measure set\nA \u2282 B and n > 0 there is a subset A\u2032 \u2282 A of positive measure and an element g \u2208 \u0393 \\ {e}\nsuch that\n1. gA\u2032 \u2282 A,\n2.\n\nd\u03bd\u25e6g\n(b)\nd\u03bd\n\n> n for every b \u2208 A\u2032 .\n\nThe ratio set is also called the asymptotic range or asymptotic ratio set. By Proposition 8.5\nof [FM77], if the action \u0393 y (B, \u03bd) is ergodic then RS(\u0393, B, \u03bd) is a closed subset of [0, \u221e].\nMoreover, RS(\u0393, B, \u03bd) \\ {0, \u221e} is a multiplicative subgroup of R>0 . In the special case in\nwhich \u0393 y (B, \u03bd) is an amenable action and a.e. orbit is infinite, it is known through work of\nW. Krieger [Kr70] that there are four possibilities for RS(\u0393, B, \u03bd): either RS(\u0393, B, \u03bd) = {1}\nin which case the action is said to be type II; RS(\u0393, B, \u03bd) = {0, 1, +\u221e} which is called type\nIII0 ; RS(\u0393, B, \u03bd) = {0, \u03bbn , +\u221e : n \u2208 Z} for some \u03bb \u2208 (0, 1) which is called type III\u03bb ;\nRS(\u0393, B, \u03bd) = [0, +\u221e] which is called type III1 . For a very readable review, see [KW91].\nThere is also an extension to general cocycles taking values in an arbitrary locally compact\ngroup in section 8 of [FM77].\nObserve that if \u0393 y (X, \u03bc) is a p.m.p. action then the product action \u0393 y (B \u00d7X, \u03bd \u00d7\u03bc)\nhas ratio set RS(\u0393, B \u00d7 X, \u03bd \u00d7 \u03bc) \u2282 RS(\u0393, B, \u03bd). Therefore, it makes sense to define the\nstable ratio set of \u0393 y (B, \u03bd) by SRS(\u0393, B, \u03bd) = \u2229RS(\u0393, B \u00d7X, \u03bd \u00d7\u03bc) where the intersection\nis over all p.m.p. actions G y (X, \u03bc). If \u0393 y (B, \u03bd) is weakly mixing then SRS(\u0393, B, \u03bd) is\na closed subset of [0, \u221e] and SRS(\u0393, B, \u03bd) \\ {0, \u221e} is a multiplicative subgroup of R>0 .\nIn the case we are most interested in, \u0393 y (B, \u03bd) is a weakly mixing amenable action\nin which a.e. orbit is infinite. Therefore \u0393 y (B \u00d7 X, \u03bd \u00d7 \u03bc) is amenable and ergodic and\nthere are only four possibilities for SRS(\u0393, B, \u03bd): either SRS(\u0393, B, \u03bd) = {1} in which case\nwe say that \u0393 y (B, \u03bd) is stable type II; SRS(\u0393, B, \u03bd) = {0, 1, +\u221e} which is called stable\ntype III0 ; SRS(\u0393, B, \u03bd) = {0, \u03bbn , +\u221e : n \u2208 Z} for some \u03bb \u2208 (0, 1) which is stable type\nIII\u03bb ; SRS(\u0393, B, \u03bd) = [0, +\u221e] which is called stable type III1 .\n\n29\n\n\f4.2\n\nThe Maharam extension\n\nSuppose \u0393 y (H, \u03b7) is a non-singular ergodic action on a standard probability space. The\ngroup \u0393 acts on H \u00d7 R by\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0013\nd\u03b7 \u25e6 g \u22121\ng(h, t) := gh, t + ln\n(h)\n.\n(4.1)\nd\u03b7\nLet \u03b8 be the measure on R given by d\u03b8(t) = et dt. The action above preserves the product\nmeasure \u03b7 \u00d7 \u03b8. This construction is called the Maharam extension [Ma64, Aa97].\nThe group of real numbers acts on H \u00d7R by \u03c6t (h, t\u2032 ) := (h, t\u2032 +t) for h \u2208 H, t, t\u2032 \u2208 R. This\naction commutes with the action of \u0393 and therefore descends to an R-action on the space of\nergodic components of \u03b7 \u00d7 \u03b8. This action is called the Mackey range of the Radon-Nikodym\ncocycle [Ma66]. It has also been called the Poincar\u00e9 flow [FM77] and the Radon-Nikodym\nflow [Mo08].\nLemma 4.1. Suppose \u0393 y (H, \u03b7) is ergodic, amenable, essentially free and type III\u03bb for\nsome 0 < \u03bb < 1. Then there is a probability measure \u03b7 \u2032 on H which is equivalent to \u03b7 such\nthat for a.e. h \u2208 H and every g \u2208 \u0393,\nd\u03b7 \u2032 \u25e6 g \u22121\n(h) \u2208 {\u03bbn : n \u2208 Z}.\nd\u03b7 \u2032\nProof. Because \u0393 y (H, \u03b7) is ergodic, amenable and essentially free, this action is orbit\nequivalent to an action of Z (see [CFW81]). Proposition 2.2 of [KW91] now implies the\nresult.\nLemma 4.2. Suppose \u0393 y (H, \u03b7) is ergodic, essentially free and type III\u03bb for some \u03bb > 0.\nIf \u03bb 6= 1 then let T = \u2212 log(\u03bb). If \u03bb = 1 then let T > 0 be arbitrary. Then for every bounded\nBorel \u0393-invariant function f on H \u00d7 R, f \u25e6 \u03c6T = f a.e.\nProof. This lemma follows from Proposition 8.3 and Theorem 8 of [FM77]. To be precise,\nthe cocycle c appearing in [FM77] is, for us, the logarithmic Radon-Nikodym cocycle on\nthe \u0393-orbit equivalence relation R := {(h, gh) : h \u2208 H, g \u2208 \u0393} on H. So c : R \u2192 R,\n\u22121\nc(h, h\u2032 ) = log d\u03bd\u25e6g\n(h) where g \u2208 \u0393 is an element such that gh = h\u2032 . This element is unique\nd\u03bd\nfor a.e. h \u2208 H because \u0393 y (H, \u03b7) is essentially free. Then, the asymptotic range r\u2217 (c) is, by\ndefinition, log(RS(\u0393, H, \u03b7) \u2229 (0, \u221e)) and the normalized proper range npr(c) is the set of all\npositive real numbers T such that for any \u0393-invariant f \u2208 L\u221e (H \u00d7 R), f (h, t) = f (h, t + T )\nfor a.e. (h, t) (by Proposition 8.3 of [FM77]). By Theorem 8 of [FM77], npr(c) = r\u2217 (c).\nCorollary 4.3. Suppose \u0393 y (H, \u03b7) is ergodic, essentially free and type III1 . Then \u0393 y\n(H \u00d7 R, \u03b7 \u00d7 \u03b8) is ergodic.\nProof. Let I be the sigma-algebra of Borel subsets of H \u00d7 R that are invariant under the\n\u0393 action and the flow {\u03c6t }t\u2208R . We claim that I is trivial (i.e., every set A \u2208 I satisfies\n\u03b7 \u00d7 \u03b8(A) = 0 or \u03b7 \u00d7 \u03b8(Ac ) = 0 where Ac denotes the complement of A). Indeed, if A \u2208 I\n30\n\n\fthen, since A is invariant under the flow {\u03c6t }t\u2208R , A = A0 \u00d7 R for some Borel set A0 \u2282 H\n(up to measure zero). Since \u0393 y (H, \u03b7) is ergodic, \u03b7(A0 ) \u2208 {0, 1} which implies the claim.\nLemma 4.2 implies that any bounded Borel \u0393-invariant function f on H \u00d7 R is invariant\nunder the flow. By the claim above, this implies f is constant a.e..

The proofs of\nthese cases are similar to the proofs above.\nRemark 4.4. The type II1 case. Theorem 4.2 applies, in particular, to any amenable group\nwhich admits a free weakly-mixing action of stable type III\u03bb for \u03bb > 0, for example when a\nnon-trivial Poisson boundary with these properties exists. However, when G is an amenable\ngroup, we can also use actions of type II1 to produce pointwise ergodic sequences on G.\nIndeed, consider a weakly mixing measure-preserving action on a probability space (B, \u03bd).\nThis action is of course amenable, and any (uniform tempered, or regular) F\u00f8lner sequence\nfor the orbit equivalence relation of B induces a random pointwise ergodic sequence in L1\nfor the G-action on X. By averaging a probability distribution \u03c8 on B we also obtain a\npointwise ergodic sequence on G for its action on X. The proof is straightforward using the\narguments in the proof of Theorem 4.2.\n34\n\n\fRemark 4.5. Convergence and identification of the limit. Let B be any free amenable\naction of a countable group \u0393, not necessarily of stable type III\u03bb or weak mixing. Thus\nfor any (uniform tempered, or regular) F\u00f8lner sequence on the \u0393-orbit equivalence relation\nrestricted to B \u00d7 [0, T ] (for any T > 0) we obtain a random sequence \u03b6r of averages which\nconverge pointwise almost surely and in L1 -norm, the limit being the conditional expectation\non the \u03c3-algebra of relation-invariant sets by Theorem 2.1. Averaging them further w.r.t. a\nprobability density \u03c8 on B \u00d7 [0, T ] we obtain averaging sequences \u03b6r\u03c8 on \u0393 which converge\npointwise almost surely. Thus amenability of B suffices to obtain convergence almost surely,\nbut may not be sufficient to identify the limit of \u03b6r\u03c8 (f ) as the ergodic mean. Our arguments\nestablishing this fact in Theorem 4.2 depend crucially on weak-mixing and stable type III1 .\nIt is interesting to note that in [BKK11] the authors prove pointwise convergence of uniform\naverages of spherical measures on Markov groups, but they do not identify the limit function.\n\n4.4\n\nLattices and actions of stable type III1\n\nSummarizing our results thus far, Theorem 4.2 provides the following recipe to prove pointwise ergodic theorems for an arbitrary group \u0393. First, find an essentially free, weakly mixing,\namenable action \u0393 y (B, \u03bd) of stable type III1 . Let T > 0, and choose a F\u00f8lner family on\n(B \u00d7 [0, T ], \u03bd[0,T ], R(B \u00d7 [0, T ])) which is uniform and tempered (or just regular). Such a\nfamily always exists by amenability, as noted in Proposition 2.1. Finally choose a probability density \u03c8 on B. From these objects, a pointwise ergodic sequence is constructed. The\nmaximal inequalities for the associated averages holds more generally (they do not depend\non the stable type or the weak mixing hypothesis as shown in \u00a73.3).\nThere are several choices in this construction: the action \u0393 y (B, \u03bd), the F\u00f8lner family\nF, and the probability density \u03c8. It is an interesting problem to determine whether a given\nfamily of probability measure {\u03bcr }r>0 on \u0393 arises from one of these constructions. For\nexample, suppose \u0393 acts cocompactly by isometries on a negatively curved manifold (M, d)\nwith a basepoint x0 and \u03b2r is the uniform probability measure on {g \u2208 \u0393 : d(gx0 , x0 ) < r}.\nThen is \u03b2r a pointwise ergodic family? Does it arise from one of these constructions? In\n[BN1] the authors used an explicit particular instance of this construction to prove that\nspherical averages form a pointwise ergodic sequence for nonabelian free groups (up to a\ncertain well-known periodicity phenomenon).\nThe importance of the action \u0393 y (B, \u03bd) leads to the following question:\nQuestion 4.6. Does every discrete group have an essentially free, weakly mixing, amenable\naction of stable type III\u03bb for some \u03bb \u2208 (0, 1]?\nThe requirement that the action be essentially free can be removed by the following\ndevice. Let u be the uniform measure on {0, 1}. \u0393 acts on the product space ({0, 1}\u0393, u\u0393 ) by\ng * x(f ) = x(g \u22121 f ) \u2200x \u2208 {0, 1}\u0393, g, f \u2208 \u0393. This is a Bernoulli shift action. If \u0393 y (B, \u03bd) is\nany action then the product action \u0393 y (B \u00d7 {0, 1}\u0393, \u03bd \u00d7 u\u0393 ) is essentially free. Moreover, if\n(B, \u03bd) has any one of the properties {weakly mixing, amenable, stable type III\u03bb } then this\nproduct action has the same property.\n35\n\n\fThe action of a group on any of its Poisson boundaries is amenable [Zi78] and weakly\nmixing [AL05] (indeed these actions are doubly ergodic with coefficients in Hilbert spaces\nby [Ka03]). If \u0393 is non-amenable, then these actions are necessarily of type III\u03bb for some\n\u03bb \u2208 [0, 1]. It may well be the case that the type of the action on a Poisson boundary is never\nIII0 , but this problem is still open.\nWe are unaware of any previous study of the stable type of an amenable action. However\nthere are results on the types of boundary actions. For example, in [INO08] it is proven\nthat the Poisson boundary of a random walk on a Gromov hyperbolic group induced by a\nnondegenerate measure on \u0393 of finite support is never of type III0 . In [Su78, Su82], Sullivan\nproved that the recurrent part of an action of a discrete conformal group on the sphere\nSd relative to the Lebesgue measure is type III1 . Spatzier [Sp87] showed that if \u0393 is the\nfundamental group of a compact connected negatively curved manifold then the action of\n\u0393 on the sphere at infinity of the universal cover is also of III1 . The types of harmonic\nmeasures on free groups were computed by Ramagge and Robertson [RR97] and Okayasu\n[Ok03].\nAn important class of discrete groups for which the type of the boundary action is known\nis that of irreducible lattices in connected semisimple Lie groups with finite center and no\ncompact factors. Let G be such a group and \u0393 \u2282 G an irreducible lattice subgroup. The\nmaximal boundary B = G/P , where P is a minimal parabolic subgroup, carries a unique\nG-quasi-invariant measure class, denoted \u03bd. As to the stable type, we have :\nProposition 4.7. The action of \u0393 on (G/P, \u03bd) is amenable, weak mixing and essentially\nfree, and of stable type III1 .\nProof. Recall the duality principle for ergodicity on homogeneous spaces [Mo66]: if G is an\nlcsc group, and H1 , H2 are two closed subgroups, then H1 is ergodic on G/H2 if and only if\nH2 is ergodic on G/H1 , if and only if G is ergodic on G/H1 \u00d7 G/H2 . The measure classes\ntaken on G/H1 and G/H2 are the unique G-invariant ones, and on G/H1 \u00d7 G/H2 we take\ntheir product. A further aspect of the duality principle for homogeneous spaces is that G/H2\nis an amenable H1 -space if H2 is an amenable subgroup [Zi84, Cor. 4.3.7].\nThe fact that the action of \u0393 on G/P is amenable and ergodic therefore follows from the\nfact that the minimal parabolic subgroup P is amenable and ergodic on G/\u0393. Here we take\nthe G-quasi-invariant measure class \u03bd on G/P . Let P = MAN be the Levi decomposition\nof P . Then up to \u03bd-measure zero G/P \u00d7 G/P \u223c\n= G/A, and since A is ergodic on G/\u0393\nby the Howe-Moore ergodicity theorem, \u0393 is ergodic on G/P \u00d7 G/P , namely \u0393 is doubly\nergodic. Similarly, \u0393 is doubly ergodic on the product with coefficients in Hilbert spaces and\nin particular, the action of \u0393 on G/P is weak mixing. It is well-known that the \u0393-action is\nalso essentially free.\nWe now show that the type of the action is III1 , and then that the stable type is also\nIII1 . First, note that the Maharam extension of the G-action on G/P , namely the action\non G/P \u00d7 R given by g(hP, t) = (ghP, t + log r\u03bd (g, hP )) is a transitive G-action. Indeed, the\nstability group of (P, 1) is the kernel of the modular homomorphism \u03b4 : P \u2192 R\u2217+ , which we\ndenote by L. Now r\u03bd (p, P ) = \u03b4(p) and the modular homomorphism is clearly surjective, so\nthe well-defined map G/L \u2192 G/P \u00d7 R given by gL 7\u2192 (gP, log r\u03bd (g, P )) is a G-equivariant\n36\n\n\fisomorphism. In particular G is ergodic on the Maharam extension G/P \u00d7 R, but then so\nis the restriction of the G-action to \u0393 by [Zi77, Thm 5.4]. Hence the Mackey range of the\nRadon-Nikodym derivative cocycle of the \u0393-action on G/P is the action of R on a point and\ntype of the \u0393-action on the boundary is III1 .\nConsider now the action of \u0393 on (G/P \u00d7 X, \u03bd \u00d7 \u03bc), where (X, \u03bc) is an ergodic \u0393-action.\nIn general, for any cocycle \u03b2 : \u0393 \u00d7 Y \u2192 H defined on a \u0393-space Y , the Mackey range of the\ncocycle \u03b2 coincides with the Mackey range of the cocycle \u03b2\u0303, defined for the G-action on the\ninduced space IndG\n\u0393 (Y ) = G/\u0393 \u00d7\u03b1 Y by \u03b2\u0303(g, u\u0393, y) = \u03b2(\u03b1(g, u\u0393), y). Here \u03b1 : G \u00d7 G/\u0393 \u2192 \u0393\nis a cocycle associated with a section \u03c4 : G/\u0393 \u2192 G with \u03c4 (\u0393) = e, and the notation \u00d7\u03b1\ndenotes that the action on the second component is via the cocycle \u03b1, namely g(u\u0393, y) =\n(gu\u0393, \u03b1(g, u\u0393)y).\nFor a \u0393-space X consider the G-action IndG\n\u0393 (G/P \u00d7 X) induced by the \u0393-action on\nG/P \u00d7 X. Note that the induced action is equivariantly isomorphic to the product G-action\non G/P and IndG\n\u0393 (X) :\nG\n\u223c\nG/\u0393 \u00d7\u03b1 (G/P \u00d7 X) = IndG\n\u0393 (G/P \u00d7 X) = G/P \u00d7 (Ind\u0393 X) = G/P \u00d7 (G/\u0393 \u00d7\u03b1 X)\n\nThis follows from the well-known fact that the action G/\u0393 \u00d7\u03b1 G/P of G induced by the\n\u0393-action on G/P is isomorphic to the product G-action on G/\u0393 \u00d7 G/P .\nIf (X, \u03bc) is a measure-preserving probability \u0393-space the Mackey range of the RadonNikodym cocycle r\u03bd\u00d7\u03bc on G/P \u00d7 X coincides with the Mackey range of the Radon-Nikodym\ncocycle of the G-action on the induced space IndG\n\u0393 (G/P \u00d7 X). Indeed the latter coincides\nwith r\u0303\u03bd\u00d7\u03bc , since the extension G/P \u00d7 (G/\u0393 \u00d7\u03b1 X) \u2192 G/P is a measure-preserving extension.\nTo find the Mackey range of the Radon-Nikodym cocycle in question, consider the Maharam extension G/P \u00d7 (IndG\n\u0393 X) \u00d7 R of the product action. The Maharam extension is\nclearly G-isomorphic to the product G-action on G/L \u00d7 IndG\n\u0393 X, since the Maharam extension G/P \u00d7 R of G/P is the G-action on G/L, as noted above. Now IndG\n\u0393 X is an ergodic\np.m.p. G-action, and its restriction to L is still ergodic. Indeed, while the G-action on\nG/\u0393 \u00d7\u03b1 X may be a reducible action, the unipotent radical N of P acts ergodically in\nany ergodic G-space. This follows from the Mautner phenomenon : if G1 is simple and\nnon-compact, then any L2 -function invariant under the unipotent radical\nN1 of a minimal\nQN\nparabolic subgrup P1 of G1 is in fact G1 -invariant. Hence if G = i=1 Gi is a product of\nQ\nsimple non-compact groups, N = N\ni=1 Ni is ergodic in any ergodic G space, and hence so is\nthe larger subgroup L.\nIt follows that the action of G on G/L \u00d7 IndG\n\u0393 X is also ergodic. Thus G is ergodic on\nthe Maharam extension, and the Mackey range of the G-action is the R-action on a point.\nBy the foregoing arguments, this is also the Mackey range of the Radon-Nikodym cocycle of\nthe action of \u0393 on G/P \u00d7 X, and thus the stable type is III1 .\n\n37\n\n\fGeneral ergodic theorems from III\u03bb actions\n\n5\n\nThe purpose of this section is to obtain general ergodic theorems as in the previous section\nbut under a different set of hypotheses. The main difference is that we assume throughout\nthat the Radon-Nikodym derivatives for the action \u0393 y (B, \u03bd) take values in a discrete\ngroup. More precisely, we assume there is some \u03bb \u2208 (0, 1) such that if\n\u0012\n\u0013\nd\u03bd \u25e6 g \u22121\nR\u03bb (g, b) := \u2212 log\u03bb\n(b)\n(5.1)\nd\u03bd\nthen R\u03bb (g, b) \u2208 Z for every g \u2208 \u0393 and a.e. b \u2208 B. Let \u0393 y B \u00d7 Z by\ng(b, n) = (gb, n + R\u03bb (g, b)).\nThis action, called the discrete Maharam extension preserves the product measure \u03bd \u00d7 \u03b8\u03bb\nwhere \u03b8\u03bb ({n}) = \u03bb\u2212n . Given an integer N \u2265 0, let I = {0, . . . , N \u2212 1} and RI be the\nequivalence relation on B \u00d7I given by restricting the orbit-equivalence relation of \u0393 y B \u00d7Z.\n\u03bb\u2212n\nLet \u03b8\u03bb,I be the probability measure on I given by \u03b8\u03bb,I ({n}) = 1+***+\u03bb\n\u2212N+1 .\nSuppose also that \u0393 y (X, \u03bc) is a p.m.p. action. Let \u0393 y B \u00d7 X \u00d7 Z by\ng(b, x, n) = (gb, gx, n + R\u03bb (g, b)).\ne I be the equivalence relation on\nThis action preserves the product measure \u03bd \u00d7 \u03bc \u00d7 \u03b8\u03bb . Let R\nB \u00d7X \u00d7I obtained by restricting the orbit-equivalence relation of the action \u0393 y B \u00d7X \u00d7Z.\nOur first step is to prove some maximal inequalities.\nTheorem 5.1. Let F = {Fr }r\u2208I be a Borel family of subset functions for (B \u00d7I, \u03bd \u00d7\u03b8\u03bb,I , RI ).\nSuppose F is either regular or (asymptotically invariant, uniform and tempered). We assume\n\u0393 y (B, \u03bd) is essentially free. Let \u03c0 : B \u00d7 X \u00d7 I \u2192 B \u00d7 I be the projection map \u03c0(b, x, t) =\ne = {F\ner }r\u2208I be the lift of F:\n(b, t) and let F\ner (x) := \u03c0 \u22121 (Fr (\u03c0(b, x, t))) \u2229 [b, x, t]\nF\n\n\u2200(b, x, t) \u2208 B \u00d7 X \u00d7 I\n\ne I -equivalence class of (b, x, t).

The proof is analogous to the proof of Theorem 3.1. We leave the details to the\nreader.\n\n5.1\n\nErgodic decomposition\n\nWe let \u0393 y (B, \u03bd), R\u03bb (g, b), \u03bb > 0, etc. be as in the previous subsection. The main result\nof this section is Corollary 5.4 which provides a formula for a certain average of conditional\nexpectation operators. We also obtain an explicit description of the ergodic decomposition\nfor the Maharam-extension action \u0393 y (B \u00d7 X \u00d7 Z, \u03bd \u00d7 \u03bc \u00d7 \u03b8\u03bb ).\nLemma 5.1. Let (W, \u03c9) be a standard probability space, \u0393 y (W, \u03c9) an ergodic action\npreserving the measure-class. Let \u03b1 : \u0393 \u00d7 W \u2192 Z be a cocycle for the action. Assume that\nfor a.e. x \u2208 W and n \u2208 Z there is a g \u2208 \u0393 with \u03b1(g, x) = n. Let N > 0 be an integer\nand R\u2032 = {(x, y) \u2208 W : \u2203g \u2208 \u0393, gx = y, \u03b1(g, x) \u2261 0 mod N}. Then there exists a positive\nk\u22121\ninteger k such that k|N and a partition {Hi }i=0\nof Z such that\n1. each Hi has positive measure, is R\u2032 -saturated,\n2. \u03c9|Hi is R\u2032 -ergodic,\n3. for a.e. x \u2208 Hi , \u2200g \u2208 \u0393, gx \u2208 Hj \u21d4 \u03b1(g, x) \u2261 j \u2212 i mod k.\nProof. Let R be the orbit-equivalence relation on W . That is, R is the set of all (x, gx)\nfor x \u2208 W, g \u2208 \u0393. The relation R\u2032 is a sub-equivalence relation of R of index N (i.e., for\na.e. x \u2208 W the R-equivalence class of x contains N distinct R\u2032 -equivalence classes). This is\nbecause for a.e. x \u2208 W and n \u2208 Z there is a g \u2208 \u0393 with \u03b1(g, x) = n.\nBecause \u0393 y (W, \u03c9) is ergodic, any R\u2032 -invariant measurable function f must take on at\nmost N different values (after ignoring a measure zero set). So the ergodic decomposition of\n\u03c9 with respect to R\u2032 contains k components for some k \u2264 N. By the ergodic decomposition\nk\u22121\ntheorem, there exists a measurable partition {Hi }i=0\nof W such that each Hi has positive\n\u2032\n\u2032\nmeasure, each Hi is R -saturated and \u03c9|Hi is R -ergodic.\nFor j \u2208 {0, . . . , k \u2212 1}, let Fj be the function on W defined by: Fj (x) is the set of all\nn + NZ \u2208 Z/NZ such that there exists g \u2208 \u0393 with gx \u2208 Hj and \u03b1(g, x) \u2261 n mod N. We\nclaim that Fj is R\u2032 -invariant a.e.. To see this, let x \u2208 W , n + NZ \u2208 Fj (x) and g \u2208 \u0393 with\ngx \u2208 Hj and \u03b1(g, x) \u2261 n mod N. Let y be R\u2032 -equivalent to x. So there exists g0 \u2208 \u0393 with\ny = g0 x and \u03b1(g0 , x) \u2261 0 mod N. Thus\n\u03b1(gg0\u22121, y) = \u03b1(gg0\u22121, g0 x) = \u03b1(g, x) + \u03b1(g0\u22121, g0 x) = \u03b1(g, x) \u2212 \u03b1(g0 , x) \u2261 \u03b1(g, x) mod N.\n39\n\n\fBecause gg0\u22121y = gx \u2208 Hj this proves that n + NZ \u2208 Fj (y). Since x, y, n are arbitrary, this\nimplies Fj is R\u2032 -invariant. By ergodicity, Fj is constant on each Hi .\nLet G be the function on W defined by G(x) = Fi (x) whenever x \u2208 Hi . We claim\nthat G is \u0393-invariant a.e.. So suppose x \u2208 Hi , y \u2208 Hj and y = g0 x for some g0 \u2208 \u0393. Let\nn + NZ \u2208 G(x). By definition, there exists g1 \u2208 \u0393 with g1 x \u2208 Hi and \u03b1(g1 , x) \u2261 n mod N.\nBecause Fj is constant on Hi , there exists g2 \u2208 \u0393 with g2 (g1 x) \u2208 Hj and \u03b1(g2 , g1 x) \u2261 \u03b1(g0 , x).\nThus g2 g1 g0\u22121 y \u2208 Hj and\n\u03b1(g2 g1 g0\u22121 , y) = \u03b1(g2 g1 g0\u22121 , g0 x) = \u03b1(g2 , g1 x) + \u03b1(g1g0\u22121 , g0 x)\n= \u03b1(g2 , g1 x) + \u03b1(g1, x) \u2212 \u03b1(g0 , x) \u2261 \u03b1(g1 , x) \u2261 n mod N.\nSince x, y, n are arbitrary, this shows that G is \u0393-invariant. By ergodicity, G is constant a.e..\nBy the cocycle equation, there is a subgroup G0 < Z/NZ such that G(x) = G0 for a.e. x.\nLet G(i, j) \u2282 Z/NZ be the subset satisfying: for a.e. x \u2208 Hi , Fj (x) = G(i, j). We claim\nthat there is an integer t(i, j) such that t(i, j) + G0 = G(i, j). Indeed, if n + NZ, m + NZ \u2208\nG(i, j) then for a.e. x \u2208 Hi there exist gn , gm \u2208 \u0393 with gn x, gm x \u2208 Hj and \u03b1(gn , x) \u2261 n\nmod N, \u03b1(gm , x) \u2261 m mod N. Therefore,\n\u03b1(gm gn\u22121 , gn x) = \u03b1(gm , x) \u2212 \u03b1(gn , x) \u2261 m \u2212 n\n\nmod N\n\nand gm gn\u22121 (gn x) \u2208 Hj . This implies m \u2212 n \u2208 G0 which establishes the claim.\nWe claim that if j1 6= j2 then G(i, j1 ) \u2229G(i, j2 ) = \u2205. Indeed, if n+ NZ \u2208 G(i, j1 ) \u2229G(i, j2 )\nthen for a.e. x \u2208 Hi there exists g1 , g2 \u2208 \u0393 such that g1 x \u2208 Hj1 , g2 x \u2208 Hj2 , \u03b1(g1 , x) \u2261\n\u03b1(g2 , x) \u2261 n mod N. Therefore, g2 x \u2208 Hj2 , g1 g2\u22121(g2 x) \u2208 Hj1 and \u03b1(g1g2\u22121 , g2 x) \u2261 0\nmod N. This contradicts the fact that Hj2 is R\u2032 -saturated. So the claim is proven.\nk\u22121\nFor each i, \u222aj=0\nG(i, j) partitions the group Z/NZ into cosets of G0 (and thus k|N and\nG0 is generated by k + NZ). So after re-indexing the Hi 's if necessary, we may assume that\nG(0, j) = j + G0 for each j.\nWe claim that G(i, j) = G(0, j \u2212 i) = j \u2212 i + G0 (indices mod k). Let n + NZ \u2208 G(i, j).\nSo for a.e. x \u2208 Hi , there is a g0 \u2208 \u0393 with g0 x \u2208 Hj and \u03b1(g0 , x) \u2261 n mod N. By\nergodicity for a.e. such x there exists g1 \u2208 \u0393 such that g1 x \u2208 H0 . Then g0 g1\u22121(g1 x) \u2208 Hj , so\n\u03b1(g0 g1\u22121, g1 x) + NZ \u2208 j + G0 and \u03b1(g1\u22121, g1 x) + NZ \u2208 i + G0 . But\n\u03b1(g0 g1\u22121 , g1 x) = \u03b1(g0 , x) + \u03b1(g1\u22121, g1 x).\nSo n \u2261 \u03b1(g0 , x) \u2261 j \u2212 i mod k. This proves the claim. Thus for a.e. x \u2208 Hi , \u2200g \u2208 \u0393,\ngx \u2208 Hj \u21d4 \u03b1(g, x) \u2261 j \u2212 i mod k.\nLemma 5.2. Suppose \u0393 y (B, \u03bd) is an essentially free, weakly mixing, amenable action of\ntype III\u03bb and stable type III\u03c4 for some \u03bb, \u03c4 \u2208 (0, 1). Suppose as well that \u03bbN = \u03c4 for some\ninteger N \u2265 1 and R\u03bb (g, b) \u2208 Z where R\u03bb (*, *) is defined as in (5.1). Let \u0393 y (X, \u03bc) be an\nergodic p.m.p. action. Let \u0393 y B \u00d7 X \u00d7 Z by\ng(b, x, n) = (gb, gx, n + R\u03bb (g, b)) .\n40\n\n\fThen for every bounded Borel \u0393-invariant function f on B \u00d7X \u00d7R, f (b, x, n) = f (b, x, n+N)\nfor a.e (b, x, n).\nProof. This lemma follows from Proposition 8.3 and Theorem 8 of [FM77]. To be precise,\nthe cocycle c appearing in [FM77] is, for us, R\u03bb . So c : R \u2192 Z, c((b, x), (b\u2032 , x\u2032 )) = R\u03bb (g, b)\nwhere g \u2208 \u0393 is an element such that gb = b\u2032 . This element is unique for a.e. b \u2208 B\nbecause \u0393 y (B, \u03bd) is essentially free. Then, the asymptotic range r\u2217 (c) is, by definition,\nlog\u03bb (RS(\u0393, B \u00d7 X, \u03bd \u00d7 \u03bc) \u2229 (0, \u221e)). Because \u0393 y (B, \u03bd) has stable type III\u03c4 with \u03c4 = \u03bbN ,\nRS(\u0393, B \u00d7 X, \u03bd \u00d7 \u03bc) \u2283 {\u03bbN i : i \u2208 Z}. So NZ \u2282 r\u2217 (c).\nThe normalized proper range npr(c) is the set of all positive integers T such that for any\n\u0393-invariant f \u2208 L\u221e (B \u00d7 X \u00d7 Z), f (b, x, n) = f (b, x, n + T ) for a.e. (b, x, n) (by Proposition\n8.3 of [FM77]). By Theorem 8 of [FM77], npr(c) = r\u2217 (c).\nLemma 5.3. Let the hypotheses be as in the previous lemma. Then there is a partition\nk\u22121\n{Hi }i=0\nof B \u00d7 X such that k | N and\nS\nk\u22121\n1. if Ki = g\u2208\u0393 g(Hi \u00d7 {0}) then {Ki }i=0\npartitions B \u00d7 X \u00d7 Z up to a set of measure\nzero;\nS\n2. Ki = j\u2208Z Hi+j \u00d7 {j} where the indices on H are taken mod k;\n3. for each i, \u0393 y (Ki , \u03bd \u00d7 \u03bc \u00d7 \u03b8\u03bb |Ki ) is ergodic;\n\n4. \u03bd \u00d7 \u03bc(Hi ) = 1/k for all i.\nProof. Let \u0393 \u00d7 Z act on B \u00d7 X \u00d7 Z by\n(g, m)(b, x, n) = (gb, gx, m + n + R\u03bb (g, h)) .\nWe claim that this action is ergodic. Indeed, any \u0393 \u00d7 Z-invariant Borel set A is necessarily\nof the form A = A0 \u00d7 Z for some \u0393-invariant A0 \u2282 B \u00d7 X. By ergodicity of the action\n\u0393 y (B \u00d7 X, \u03bc \u00d7 \u03bd), \u03bc \u00d7 \u03bd(A0 ) \u2208 {0, 1} which implies A or its complement has \u03bc \u00d7 \u03bd \u00d7 \u03b8\u03bb measure zero, establishing the claim.\nLet f be a bounded \u0393-invariant Borel function on B \u00d7 X \u00d7 Z. By Lemma 5.2, for a.e.\n(b, x, n) \u2208 B \u00d7 X \u00d7 Z, f (b, x, n) = f (b, x, n + N). That is, f is invariant under the action of\nthe subgroup \u0393 \u00d7 NZ.\nLet R = {((b, x), g(b, x)) \u2208 B\u00d7X\u00d7B\u00d7X : (b, x) \u2208 B\u00d7X, g \u2208 \u0393} be the orbit-equivalence\nrelation for the action \u0393 y (B \u00d7 X, \u03bd \u00d7 \u03bc). Let R\u2032 be the set of all ((b, x), g(b, x)) \u2208 R such\nthat R\u03bb (g, b) \u2261 0 mod N. Because \u0393 y (B, \u03bd) is type III\u03bb and R\u03bb (g, b) takes values in the\nintegers, it follows that for a.e. b \u2208 B, R\u03bb (*, b) maps onto Z. By Lemma 5.1, there exists\nk\u22121\na measurable partition {Hi }i=0\nof B \u00d7 X such that k | N, each Hi has positive measure,\n\u2032\neach Hi is R -saturated, \u03bd \u00d7 \u03bc|Hi is R\u2032 -ergodic for each i and for a.e. (b, x) \u2208 Hi , \u2200g \u2208 \u0393,\ng(b, x) \u2208 Hj \u21d4 R\u03bb (g, b) \u2261 j \u2212 i mod k.\nLet Ki be the \u0393-orbit of Hi \u00d7{0} \u2282 B\u00d7X \u00d7Z. Because \u0393-invariance automatically implies\nk\u22121\n\u0393\u00d7NZ-invariance, each Ki is \u0393\u00d7NZ-invariant. Because {Hi }i=0\npartitions S\nB \u00d7X, it follows\nk\u22121\nthat {Ki }i=0 partitions B \u00d7 X \u00d7 Z (up to measure zero sets). Also Ki = j\u2208Z Hi+j \u00d7 {j}\n41\n\n\fwhere the indices on H are taken mod k (because of the last statement in the previous\nlemma).\nThe restriction of \u03bd \u00d7 \u03bc \u00d7 \u03b8\u03bb to Ki is ergodic for the \u0393-action. To see this, let f be\na bounded \u0393-invariant Borel function with support in Ki . As mentioned above, f is \u0393 \u00d7\nNZ-invariant. Therefore, if ((b, x), g(b, x)) \u2208 R\u2032 (i.e., R\u03bb (g, b) \u2208 NZ) then f (b, x, 0) =\nf (gb, gx, R\u03bb(g, b)) = f (gb, gx, 0). So the map (b, x) 7\u2192 f (b, x, 0) is R\u2032 -invariant. Because\n\u03bd \u00d7 \u03bc|Hi is R\u2032 -ergodic, f restricted to Hi \u00d7 {0} is constant. Because Ki is the \u0393-orbit of\nHi \u00d7 {0}, this implies that f is constant on Ki . Because f is arbitrary, this proves the claim:\n\u0393 y (Ki , \u03bd \u00d7 \u03bc \u00d7 \u03b8\u03bb |Ki ) is ergodic.\nLet F : B \u00d7 X \u2192 [0, 1] be the function defined a.e. by F (b, x) = \u03bc(A(b,x) ) where A(b,x) is\ndefined by\n{b} \u00d7 A(b,x) = ({b} \u00d7 X) \u2229 Hi\nwhere i is such that (b, x) \u2208 Hi . We claim that F is \u0393-invariant. Indeed, if (b, x) \u2208 Hi and\ng \u2208 \u0393 then g(b, x) \u2208 Hi+R\u03bb (g,b) (index mod k). Thus Ag(b,x) = gA(b,x) which, because \u03bc is\n\u0393-invariant, implies the claim. By ergodicity of \u0393 y B \u00d7 X, there is a constant c > 0 such\nthat F = c a.e.\nLet \u03c0B : B \u00d7 X \u2192 B be the projection map. Fix i with 0 \u2264 i \u2264 k \u2212 1. For b \u2208 \u03c0B (Hi ),\nchoose an element xb \u2208 X with (b, xb ) \u2208 Hi . Then\nZ\n\u03bd \u00d7 \u03bc(Hi ) =\nF (b, xb ) d\u03bd(b) = c * \u03bd(\u03c0B (Hi )).\n(5.2)\n\u03c0B (Hi )\n\nWe claim that \u03c0B (Hi ) = B (up to sets of measure zero) for every i. To see this, let R\u2032B\nbe the equivalence relation on B given by (b, gb) \u2208 R\u2032B if and only if R\u03bb (g, b) \u2261 0 mod N.\nWe claim that \u03bd is R\u2032B -ergodic. By Lemma 5.1 there is a measurable partition {Ci }m\u22121\ni=0 of\n\u2032\n\u2032\nB into RB -saturated positive measure sets such that \u03bd restricted to each Ci is RB -ergodic\n(for some integer m | N). Moreover, for b \u2208 Ci , gb \u2208 Ci+R\u03bb (g,b) with indices mod m.\nBecause \u0393 y (B, \u03bd) is type III\u03bb , there exists a positive measure subset C0\u2032 \u2282 C0 and an\nelement g \u2208 \u0393 \\ {e} such that gC0\u2032 \u2282 C0 and for every b \u2208 C0\u2032 , R\u03bb (g, b) = 1. Thus 0 \u2261 1\nmod m. So m = 1 and \u03bd is R\u2032B -ergodic as claimed.\nBecause Hi is R\u2032 -saturated, it follows that each \u03c0B (Hi ) is R\u2032B -saturated. By ergodicity\nand since \u03bd \u00d7 \u03bc(Hi ) > 0, this implies\nPk\u22121 \u03c0B (Hi ) = B up to a set of measure zero. By (5.2),\n\u03bd \u00d7 \u03bc(Hi ) = c for every i. Since i=0 \u03bd \u00d7 \u03bc(Hi ) = 1, this implies c = 1/k which finishes the\nlemma.\nCorollary 5.4. Let the hypotheses be as in the previous lemma. Let I = {0, . . . , N \u22121} and\ne I be the restricted orbit-equivalence relation on B \u00d7 X \u00d7 I. Let K i = Ki \u2229 B \u00d7 X \u00d7 I.\nlet R\nThen \u03bd \u00d7\u03bc \u00d7\u03b8\u03bb (K i ) = \u03bd \u00d7\u03bc \u00d7\u03b8\u03bb (K j ) for every i, j. Also let \u03b7ei be the restriction of \u03bd \u00d7\u03bc \u00d7\u03b8\u03bb\ne I -invariant, ergodic and\nto K i and normalized to have total mass 1.
