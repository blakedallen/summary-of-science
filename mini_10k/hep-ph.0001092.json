A phenomenological model of hard diffraction is presented, in which\nthe structure of the Pomeron is derived from the structure of the parent hadron.\nPredictions for diffractive deep inelastic scattering are compared with data.\n\nThe inclusive and diffractive deep inelastic scattering (DIS) cross sections are\nproportional to the corresponding F2 structure functions of the proton,\nInclusive DIS\nDiffractive DIS\n\nF h (x,Q2 )\nd2 \u03c3\n\u221d 2 x\ndxdQ2\nD(3)\nF\n(\u03be,x,Q2 )\nd3 \u03c3\n\u221d 2 x\nd\u03bedxdQ2\n\nwhere the superscripts h and D(3) indicate, respectively, a hard structure function (at\nscale Q2 ) and a 3-variable diffractive structure function (integrated over t). The latter\ndepends not only on the hard scale Q2 , but also on the soft scale, hMT i \u223c 1 GeV, which\nis the relevant scale for the formation of the diffractive rapidity gap.\nThe only marker of the rapidity gap is the variable \u03be. We therefore postulate that\nthe rapidity gap probability is proportional to the soft parton density at \u03be and write the\nDDIS (diffractive DIS) cross section as\nF2h (x, Q2 ) F2s (\u03be)\nd3 \u03c3\n\u221d\n\u00d7\n\u2297 \u03be\u2212norm\nd\u03bedxdQ2\nx\n\u03be\nwhere the symbolic notation \"\u2297 \u03be\u2212norm\" is used to indicate that the \u03be probability is\nnormalized. Since x = \u03b2\u03be, the normalization over all available \u03be values involves not only\nF2s but also F2h , breaking down factorization. It is therefore prudent to write the DDIS\ncross section in terms of \u03b2 instead of x, so that the dependence of F2h on \u03be be shown\nexplicitly:\n\"\n#\nF2s (\u03be)\n1\nd3 \u03c3\nh\n2\nF (\u03b2\u03be, Q ) \u00d7\n\u221d\n\u2297 \u03be\u2212norm\nd\u03bed\u03b2dQ2\n\u03b2 2\n\u03be\nD(3)\n\nThe term in the brackets represents the DDIS structure function F2\n\n(\u03be, \u03b2, Q2).\n\n\u2021 To appear in Proceedings of \"UK Phenomenology Workshop on Collider Physics, Durham, UK, 19-24\nSeptember 1999,\" to be published in Journal of Physics G: Nuclear and Particle Physics. This paper\nis an expanded excerpt from hep-ph/9911210, which will apper in Proceedings of \"XXIX International\nSymposium on Multiparticle Dynamics, 9-13 August 1999, Brown University, Providence, RI 02912,\nUSA\", to be published by World Scientific Publishing Company.\n\n\f2\n\nDiffraction: A New Approach\n\nIn the next step, we seek guidance from the scaling behavior of the soft singlediffractive (sd) differential cross section [1, 2],\n1\nd\u03c3sd\n\u221d\n2\n2\ndM\n(M )1+\u01eb\n\n(no s-dependence!)\n\nwhich in terms of \u03be takes the form\nd\u03c3sd\n\u221d\nd\u03be\n\n1\n1\n2\u01eb\n1+2\u01eb\ns \u03be\n|\n\n{z\n\n}\n\n\u00d7(s\u2032 )\u01eb\n\ngap probability\nwhere s\u2032 \u2261 M 2 is the s-value of the diffractive sub-system. Noting that \u03be is related\nR\nd\u03be\nto the associated rapidity gap by \u2206Y = ln 1\u03be , and that the integral 1s\u25e6 /s s12\u01eb \u03be 1+2\u01eb is\nequal to a constant, the above equation may be viewed as representing the product of\nthe total cross section at the sub-system energy multiplied by a normalized rapidity\ngap probability. In analogy with this experimentally established behavior, we factorize\nD(3)\nF2 (\u03be, \u03b2, Q2) into F2h (\u03b2, Q2 ), the sub-energy DIS cross section, times a normalized gap\nprobability:\nD(3)\nF2 (\u03be, \u03b2, Q2) = Pgap (\u03be, \u03b2, Q2) \u00d7 F2h (\u03b2, Q2 )\nThe gap probability is therefore given by\u00a7\n2\n\nPgap (\u03be, \u03b2, Q ) =\n\nF2h (\u03b2\u03be, Q2)\n\nF2s (\u03be)\n\u00d7 N(s, \u03b2, Q2 )\n\u00d7\n\u03be\n\nThe normalization factor, N(s, \u03b2, Q2 ), is obtained from the following equation, using\n\u03bemin = Q2 /s,\nF s (\u03be)\n1Z 1\n\u22121\n2\nF2h (\u03b2\u03be, Q2 ) \u00d7 2 d\u03be\nN (s, \u03b2, Q ) =\nfq \u03bemin\n\u03be\nwhere fq is the quark fraction of the hard structure and is used here since only quarks\nparticipate in DIS.\nAt small x (\u2264\u223c 0.1), the structure functions F2h and F2s are represented well by\n2\nthe power law expressions [3] F2h (x, Q2 ) = Ah /x\u03bbh (Q ) and F2s (\u03be) = As /\u03be \u03bbs . Using these\nforms we obtain\n\uf8ee\n\nAs\n1 \uf8f0 Ah\nN \u22121 (s, \u03b2, Q2) =\nfq \u03b2 \u03bbh \u03bbh + \u03bbs\nD(3)\nF2 (\u03be, \u03b2, Q2)\n\n=\n\n1\n\u03be 1+\u03bbh +\u03bbs\n\n\u00d7 fq (\u03bbh + \u03bbs )\n\n\u03b2s\nQ2\n\n!\u03bbh +\u03bbs \uf8f9\n\nQ2\n\u03b2s\n\n\uf8fb\n\n!\u03bbh +\u03bbs\n\n\u00d7\n\nAh\n\u03b2 \u03bbh\n\n\u00a7 In hep-ph/9911210, a factor of \u03b21 was erroneously included in Eq. (13) of the gap probability; however,\nthis factor is carried over into the normalization factor N (s, \u03b2, Q2 ) through Eqs. (14) and (15) and\nD(3)\ncancels out in the final result for F2\nin Eq. (16).\n\n\f3\n\nDiffraction: A New Approach\nD(3)\n\nSince in DDIS x is always smaller than \u03be, the above form of F2 , derived for small\nx, should be valid for all x when \u03be is small; it should also be valid for all \u03b2(= x/\u03be). We\nD(3)\ntherefore expect F2\nto have the following \u03be and \u03b2 dependence at small \u03be:\nD(3)\n\nF2\n\nD(3)\n\nF2\n\n1\n\n(\u03be, \u03b2, Q2)|\u03b2,Q2 \u221d\n\n\u03be 1+n\n\n(\u03be, \u03b2, Q2)|\u03be,Q2 \u221d\n\n1\n\u03b2m\n\nn = \u03bbh (Q2 ) + \u03bbs\nm = 2\u03bbh (Q2 ) + \u03bbs\n\nThe HERA (non-diffractive) DIS measurements [3] yield \u03bbs \u2248 0.1, which is in agreement\nwith the value of \u01eb = \u03b1(0) \u2212 1 = 0.104 [4], where \u03b1(0) is the intercept of the Pomeron\ntrajectory at t=0. In the Q2 range of 10-50 GeV2 , where the DDIS data are concentrated,\nthese measurements yield \u03bbh \u2248 0.3. Using these values we obtain n = 0.4 and m = 0.7.\nWe therefore expect\n1\n1\nD(3)\nPrediction: F2\n\u221d 1.4 \u00d7 0.7\n\u03be\n\u03b2\nWe observe the following features:\n\nFactorization\nOur prediction exhibits factorization between \u03be and \u03b2, in agreement with HERA results\nat small \u03be.\n\u03be-dependence\nD(3)\nIn the Regge framework, the \u03be-dependence of F2\nis expected to have the \"Pomeron\nflux\" form of 1/\u03be 1+n with n = 2\u01eb = 0.2, independent of Q2 . In the Q2 range of 10-50\nGeV2 , the HERA experiments find that n is \u2248 0.4 and has a small Q2 dependence, in\nagreement with our prediction of n = \u03bbh (Q2 ) + \u03bbs .\n\u03b2-dependence\nD(3)\nThe predicted form 1/\u03b2 m for F2\nis valid in the region of (fixed) small \u03be and high Q2 ,\n2\nwhere the x-distribution of F2 (x, Q2 ) has the form Ah /x\u03bbh (Q ) . As there are no data\npoints at strictly fixed \u03be, we have selected the following set of five points at \u03be \u2248 0.01\nand Q2 = 45 GeV2 from Ref.
