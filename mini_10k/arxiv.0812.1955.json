The Ising model is widely used in the theory\nof phase transitions for the study of the properties of various magnetic and\nnon-magnetic systems (ferroelectrics, ferromagnets, binary mixtures, etc.).\n1\n\n\fThe description of the phase transitions in the 3D magnets, usually, is\nassociated with the absence of exact solutions and with many approximate\napproaches for obtaining different system characteristics. In this article, the\nbehavior of a 3D Ising-like system near the critical point in a homogeneous\nexternal field is studied using the collective variables (CV) method [3\u20135]. The\nmain peculiarity of this method is the integration of short-wave spin-density\noscillation modes, which is generally done without using perturbation theory.\nThe CV method is similar to the Wilson non-perturbative renormalizationgroup (RG) approach (integration on fast modes and construction of an\neffective theory for slow modes) [6\u20138]. The term collective variables is a\ncommon name for a special class of variables that are specific for each individual physical system [3, 4]. The CV set contains variables associated with\norder parameters. Because of this, the phase space of CV is most natural\nfor describing a phase transition. For magnetic systems, the CV \u03c1k are the\nvariables associated with modes of spin-moment density oscillations, while\nthe order parameter is related to the variable \u03c10 , in which the subscript \"0\"\ncorresponds to the peak of the Fourier transform of the interaction potential.\nThe free energy of a 3D Ising-like system in an external field at temperatures above Tc is calculated using the non-Gaussian spin-density fluctuations, namely the sextic measure density. The latter is represented as an\nexponential function of the CV whose argument includes the powers with the\ncorresponding coupling constants up to the sixth power of the variable (the\n\u03c16 model).\nThe present publication supplements the earlier works [9\u201312], in which\nthe \u03c16 model was used for calculating the free energy and other thermodynamic functions of the system in the absence of an external field. The \u03c16\nmodel provides a better quantitative description of the critical behavior of\na 3D Ising-like magnet than the \u03c14 model [11]. For each of the \u03c12m models,\nthere exists a preferred value of the RG parameter s = s\u2217 (s\u2217 = 3.5862 for\nthe \u03c14 model, s\u2217 = 2.7349 for the \u03c16 model, s\u2217 = 2.6511 for the \u03c18 model, and\ns\u2217 = 2.6108 for the \u03c110 model) nullifying the average value of the coefficient\nin the term with the second power in the effective density of measure at the\nfixed point. The values of s close to s\u2217 are optimal for the given method of\ncalculations. The difference form of the recurrence relations (RR) between\nthe coefficients of effective non-Gaussian densities of measures operates successfully just in this region of s. It was established (see, for example, [11,12])\nthat as the form of the density of measure becomes more complicated, the\ndependence of the critical exponent of the correlation length \u03bd on the RG\n2\n\n\fparameter s becomes weaker gradually, and, starting from the sextic density\nof measure, the value of the exponent \u03bd, having a tendency to saturate with\nincreasing m (which characterizes the order of the \u03c12m model, m = 2, 3, 4, 5),\nchanges insignificantly. The Ising model corresponds to the \u03c12m model approximation, where the order of the model 2m \u2265 4. The \u03c14 model allows us\nto go beyond the classical analysis and to describe all qualitative aspects of\nthe second-order phase transition. The critical behavior of a 3D Ising-like\nsystem within the CV method can be described quantitatively at 2m \u2265 6,\nand, in particular, at 2m = 6. It was shown in [11, 13] that the graphs of the\ntemperature dependences of the order parameter (the spontaneous magnetization) and specific heat for the \u03c16 model agree more closely with the Liu\nand Fisher's results [14] than the corresponding plots for the \u03c14 model. The\ncorrectness of the choice of the \u03c16 model for investigations is also confirmed\nin [15] and [16], where the effective potential is studied for the scalar field theory in three dimensions in the symmetric and spontaneously broken phases,\nrespectively. In this case, probability distributions of average magnetization\nin the 3D Ising model in an external field, obtained with the help of the\nMonte Carlo method, were used. Tsypin [15, 16] proved that the term with\nthe sixth power of the variable in the effective potential plays an important\nrole.\nThe methods existing at present make it possible to calculate universal\nquantities to a quite high degree of accuracy (see, for example, [1]). The\nadvantage of the CV method lies in the possibility of obtaining and analysing\nthermodynamic characteristics as functions of the microscopic parameters of\nthe initial system [11\u201313]. The results of calculations for a 3D Ising system\non the basis of the \u03c14 and \u03c16 models are in accord with the results obtained\nby other authors (see [11, 13]). In [17], the scaling functions of the order\nparameter and susceptibility, calculated on the basis of the free energy for the\n\u03c14 model, were graphically compared with other authors' data. Our results\naccord with the results obtained within the framework of the parametric\nrepresentation of the equation of state [18] and Monte Carlo simulations [2].\nThe expressions for the thermodynamic characteristics of the system in\nthe presence of an external field have already been obtained on the basis of\nthe simplest non-Gaussian measure density (the \u03c14 model) in [19\u201322] using\nthe point of exit of the system from the critical regime as a function of the\ntemperature (the weak-field region) or of the field (the strong-field region).\nIn [19, 20], the thermodynamic characteristics are presented in the form of\nseries expansions in the variables, which are combinations of the tempera3\n\n\fture and field. Our calculations in the \u03c14 model approximation were also\nperformed for temperatures T > Tc [21] and T < Tc [22] without using similar expansions for the roots of cubic equations appearing in the theoretical\nanalysis. In this article, the free energy of a 3D uniaxial magnet within the\nframework of the more complicated \u03c16 model is found without using series\nexpansions introducing the generalized point of exit of the system from the\ncritical regime. This point takes into account the temperature and field variables simultaneously. In our earlier article [17], the point of exit of the system\nfrom the critical regime was found in the simpler non-Gaussian approximation (the \u03c14 model) using the numerical calculations. In contrast to [17], the\npoint of exit of the system in the present article is explicitely defined as a\nfunction of the temperature and field. This allows one to obtain the free energy without involving the numerical calculations that is our problem solved\nin the present article.\n\n2\n\nIntegration of partition function of the system in the \u03c16 model approximation taking\ninto account effect of an external field\n\nWe consider a 3D Ising-like system on a simple cubic lattice with N sites\nand period c in a homogeneous external field h.

(10) are also defined on the basis\nof expressions corresponding to a zero external field.\n7\n\n\f3\n\nUsing the generalized point of exit of the\nsystem from the critical-regime region for\ncalculating the free energy\n\nLet us calculate the free energy F = \u2212kT ln Z of a 3D Ising-like system\nabove the critical temperature Tc . The basic idea of such a calculation on\nthe microscopic level consists in the separate inclusion of the contributions\nfrom short-wave (FCR , the region of the critical regime) and long-wave (FLGR ,\nthe region of the limiting Gaussian regime) modes of spin-moment density\noscillations [3\u20135]:\nF = F0 + FCR + FLGR .\n(14)\nHere F0 = \u2212kT N ln 2 is the free energy of N noninteracting spins. Each\nof three components in Eq. (14) corresponds to individual factor in the\nconvenient representation\nZ = 2N ZCR ZLGR\n\n(15)\n\nfor the partition function given by Eq. (7). The contributions from shortand long-wave modes to the free energy of the system in the presence of\nan external field are calculated in the \u03c16 model approximation according to\nthe scheme proposed in [9\u201312]. Short-wave modes are characterized by a\nRG symmetry and are described by the non-Gaussian measure density. The\ncalculation of the contribution from long-wave modes is based on using the\nGaussian measure density as the basis one. Here, we have developed a direct\nmethod of calculations with the results obtained by taking into account the\nshort-wave modes as initial parameters. The main results obtained in the\ncourse of deriving the complete expression for the free energy of the system\nare presented below.\n\n3.1\n\nRegion of the critical regime\n\nA calculation technique based on the \u03c16 model for the contribution FCR\nis similar to that elaborated in the absence of an external field (see, for\nexample, [5, 10, 11]). Carrying out the summation of partial tree energies Fn\nover the layers of the phase space of CV, we can calculate FCR :\n\u2032\nFCR = F0\u2032 + FCR\n,\n\n8\n\n\fF0\u2032 = \u2212kT N \u2032 [ln Q(M) + ln Q(d)],\n\u2032\nFCR\n=\n\nnp\nX\n\nFn .\n\n(16)\n\nn=1\n\nAn explicit dependence of Fn on the layer number n is obtained using solutions (10) of RR and series expansions of special functions in small deviations\nof the basic arguments from their values at the fixed point. The main peculiar feature of the present calculations lies in using the generalized point of\nexit of the system from the critical regime of order-parameter fluctuations.\nThe inclusion of the more complicated expression for the exit point (as a\nfunction of both the temperature and field variables) [24]\nnp = \u2212\n\nln(h\u03032 + h\u03032c )\n\u22121\n2 ln E1\n\n(17)\n\n\u2032\nleads to the distinction between formula (16) for FCR\nand the analogous\n\u2032\nrelation at h = 0 [10, 11]. The quantity h\u0303 = h /f0 is determined by the\ndimensionless field h\u2032 , while the quantity h\u0303c = \u03c4\u0303 p0 is a function of the reduced\n(0)\ntemperature \u03c4 = (T \u2212 Tc )/Tc . Here \u03c4\u0303 = c\u03031 \u03c4 /f0 , p0 = ln E1 / ln E2 =\n(0)\n(d + 2)\u03bd/2, c\u03031 characterizes the coefficient c1 in solutions (10) of RR, \u03bd =\nln s/lnE2 is the critical exponent of the correlation length. At h = 0, np\nbecomes m\u03c4 = \u2212 ln \u03c4\u0303 / ln E2 \u2212 1 (see [5, 10, 11]). At T = Tc (\u03c4 = 0), the\nquantity np coincides with the exit point nh = \u2212 ln h\u0303/ ln E1 \u2212 1 [25]. The\nlimiting value of the field h\u0303c is obtained by the equality of the exit points\ndefined by the temperature and by the field (m\u03c4 = nh ).\nHaving expression (17) for np , we arrive at the relations [26]\nn +1\n\nn +1\n\nE1 p = (h\u03032 + h\u03032c )\u22121/2 ,\n\u03c4\u0303 E2 p = Hc ,\n0\nHc = h\u03031/p\n(h\u03032 + h\u03032c )\u22121/(2p0 ) ,\nc\nn +1\nE3 p = H3 ,\nH3 = (h\u03032 + h\u03032c )\u22061 /(2p0 ) ,\nn +1\nE4 p = H4 ,\nH4 = (h\u03032 + h\u03032c )\u22062 /(2p0 ) ,\ns\u2212(np +1) = (h\u03032 + h\u03032c )1/(d+2) ,\n\n(18)\n\nwhere \u22061 = \u2212 ln E3 / ln E2 and \u22062 = \u2212 ln E4 / ln E2 are the exponents, which\ndetermine the first and second confluent corrections, respectively. Numerical\nvalues of the quantities El (l = 1, 2, 3, 4), \u03bd, \u22061 , and \u22062 for the optimal RG\nparameter s = s\u2217 = 2.7349 are given in Table 1.

In the particular case\nn +1\nof h = 0 and \u03c4 6= 0, Eqs. (19) are defined as E1 p = \u03c4\u0303 \u2212p0 , Hc = 1, H3 = \u03c4\u0303 \u22061 ,\nn +1\nH4 = \u03c4\u0303 \u22062 , s\u2212(np +1) = \u03c4\u0303 \u03bd .

(20)].\nWe shall perform the further calculations on the basis of Eqs. (18),\nwhich are valid in the general case for the regions of small, intermediate\nn +1\n(the crossover region), and large field values. The inclusion of E3 p (or H3 )\nleads to the formation of the first confluent corrections in the expressions for\nn +1\nthermodynamic characteristics of the system. The quantity E4 p (or H4 )\nis responsible for the emergence of the second confluent corrections. The\ncases of the weak or strong fields can be obtained from general expressions\nby using Eqs. (19) or (20). We disregard the second confluent correction\nin our calculations. This is due to the fact that the contribution from the\nfirst confluent correction to thermodynamic functions near the critical point\n(\u03c4 = 0, h = 0) for various values of s is more significant than the small\ncontribution from the second correction (h\u03032 + h\u03032c \u226a 1, \u22061 is of the order of\n0.5, and \u22062 > 2, see Table 1 and [9]).\nProceeding from an explicit dependence of Fn on the layer number n\n[5, 9, 10] and taking into account Eqs.

The calculations are performed according to the scheme proposed in [3,5,11,12]. As in the previous study, while calculating the partition\nfunction component ZLGR from Eq. (15), it is convenient to single out two\n(1)\nregions of values of wave vectors. The first is the transition region (ZLGR )\ncorresponding to values of k close to Bnp , while the second is the Gaussian\n(2)\nregion (ZLGR ) corresponding to small values of wave vector (k \u2192 0).

(23), \u1e211 is presented in\nEqs. (48), and \u03b3\u03044+ is given in Eqs. (50). The coefficients of the non-analytic\ncomponent of the free energy F [see Eqs. (52)] depend on Hc . The terms\nproportional to H3 determine the confluent corrections by the temperature\nand field. As is seen from the expression for F , the free energy of the system\nat h\u0303 = 0 and \u03c4\u0303 = 0, in addition to terms proportional to \u03c4\u0303 3\u03bd (or h\u03036/5\nc ) and\n6/5\n3\u03bd+\u22061\n6/5+\u22061 /p0\nh\u0303 , contains the terms proportional to \u03c4\u0303\nand h\u0303\n, respectively.\nAt h\u0303 6= 0 and \u03c4\u0303 6= 0, the terms of both types are present. It should be noted\nthat \u22061 > \u22061 /p0 . At h\u0303 = h\u0303c , we have \u03c4\u0303 \u22061 = h\u0303\u22061 /p0 and the contributions\nto the thermodynamic characteristics of the system from both types of the\ncorrections become of the same order.\nThe advantage of the method presented in this article is the possibility of\nderiving analytic expressions for the free-energy coefficients as functions of\nthe microscopic parameters of the system (the lattice constant c and parameters of the interaction potential, i.e., the effective radius b of the potential,\nthe Fourier transform \u03a6\u0303(0) of the potential for k = 0).\n\n5\n\nConclusions\n\nAn analytic method for calculating the total free energy of a 3D Ising-like\nsystem (a 3D uniaxial magnet) near the critical point is developed on the\nmicroscopic level in the higher non-Gaussian approximation based on the sextic distribution for modes of spin-moment density oscillations (the \u03c16 model).\nThe simultaneous effect of the temperature and field on the behavior of the\nsystem is taken into account. An external field is introduced in the Hamiltonian of the system from the outset. In contrast to previous studies on the\nbasis of the asymmetric \u03c14 model [19, 20, 27], the field in the initial process\nof calculating the partition function of the system is not included in the Jacobian of transition from the set of spin variables to the set of CV. Such\nan approach leads to the appearance of the first, second, fourth, and sixth\npowers of CV in the expression for the partition function and allows us to\nsimplify the mathematical description because the odd part is represented\nonly by the linear term.\nThe theory is being built ab initio beginning from the Hamiltonian of the\nsystem up to the expression for the free energy. The main distinctive feature\n20\n\n\fof the proposed method is the separate inclusion of the contributions to the\nfree energy from the short- and long-wave spin-density oscillation modes.\nThe generalized point of exit of the system from the critical regime contains\nboth the temperature and field variables. The form of the temperature and\nfield dependences for the free energy of the system is determined by solutions\nof RR near the fixed point. The expression for the free energy F obtained\nat temperatures T > Tc without using power series in the scaling variable\nand without any adjustable parameters can be employed in the field region\nnear h\u0303c (the crossover region). The limiting field h\u0303c satisfies the condition\nof the equality of sizes of the critical-regime region by the temperature and\nfield (the effect of the temperature and field on the system in the vicinity\nof the critical point is equivalent) [19, 20, 25, 27]. In the vicinity of h\u0303c , the\nscaling variable is of the order of unity and power series in this variable are\nnot effective. We hope that the proposed method as well as our explicit\nrepresentations may provide useful benchmarks in studying the effect of an\nexternal magnetic field on the critical behavior of 3D Ising-like systems within\nthe framework of the higher non-Gaussian approximation (the \u03c16 model).\nProceeding from the expression for the free energy, which involves the leading\nterms and terms determining the temperature and field confluent corrections,\nwe can find other thermodynamic characteristics (the average spin moment,\nsusceptibility, entropy, and specific heat) by direct differentiation of F with\nrespect to field or temperature.\n\nReferences\n[1] A.
