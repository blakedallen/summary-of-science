Being expressed in terms of transmission eigenvalues\nTi of a conductor, the dimensionless conductance, g, and the\nzero-frequency shot-noise power, p, of the two-terminal setup\nat zero temperature are respectively given by\ng=\n\nn\nX\n\nTi\n\nand p =\n\nn\nX\n\nTi (1 \u2212 Ti ) .\n\n(1)\n\ni\n\ni\n\nHere, n \u2261 min(N1 , N2 ) where N1,2 is the number of scattering channels in each of the two attached leads.\nGenerally, the positive quantities Ti \u2264 1 are mutually correlated random numbers whose fluctuations depend on the\nconductor's nature. In the case of chaotic cavities considered\nbelow, the joint distribution of Ti is believed to be provided\nby the random matrix theory (RMT) and reads as follows1\nP({Ti }) = N\u03b2\u22121\n\nn\nY\n\ni=1\n\nTi\u03b1\u22121\n\nY\n\n|Tj \u2212 Tk |\u03b2 ,\n\n(2)\n\nj<k\n\nwith \u03b1 = \u03b22 (|N1 \u2212 N2 | + 1) and normalization constant N\u03b2 .\nThe symmetry index \u03b2 (= 1, 2, or 4) distinguishes between\nthe three standard RMT classes (orthogonal, unitary, or symplectic ensembles, respectively) which are realized depending\non the presence or absence of time-reversal and spin-flip symmetry in the system.1,3\nThe exact RMT results for the average and variance of the\nconductance are well known for quite a long time1,4,5 and that\nfor the average shot-noise power has become available only\nrecently.6 As concerns higher order cumulants of these quantities, their exact RMT expressions valid at arbitrary N1,2 have\nnot been reported in the literature so far, a progress in this direction being announced very recently.7\nIn this communication, we answer this question by further\ndeveloping and applying the theory of Selberg's integral to\nthe problem. As was recently recognized,6 such an approach\nis a powerful non-perturbative method suited particularly well\nfor the studies of moments and counting statistics, see also\nRefs. 7 and 8. It represents a useful alternative to orthogonal\n\npolynomial3 or diagrammatic9 approaches, especially in the\nsituation when the finite dimensionality of relevant random\nmatrices becomes important.\nSelberg's integral appears naturally in the problem first as\nan integral determining the normalization constant\nN\u03b2 =\n\nn\u22121\nY\nj=1\n\n\u0393(1 + \u03b22 (1 + j)) \u0393(\u03b1 + \u03b22 j) \u0393(1 + \u03b22 j)\n\u0393(1 + \u03b22 ) \u0393(1 + \u03b1 + \u03b22 (n + j \u2212 1))\n\n.\n\n(3)\n\nThis expression assures that (2) is a probability density, being\ngenerally valid for discrete n and continuous \u03b1 and \u03b2.10 To\nstudy the cumulants of g and p, one needs to know the moments hT1n1 * * * Tknk i, with h. . .i standing for the integration\nover the joint probability density\nP(2) and ni \u2265 0. Here, we\ncalculate all the moments with i ni \u2264 4 by deriving a set\nof algebraic relations for them and reducing the moments to\nforms of Selberg's integral. Presenting the relevant technical\ndetails at the end of the paper, we now discuss applications of\nthe obtained results to various linear and nonlinear statistics\non the transmission eigenvalues.\nTransmitted charge cumulants.\u2013 The statistics of charge q\n(in units of e) transmitted through the cavity over the observation time is usually described by means of the current or\ncharge cumulants, hhq m ii. Following Levitov et al.11,12 , it is\nconvenient to use a general formula for the cumulant generating function expressed\nin terms of P\nthe transmission eigenP\nm\nvalues as follows m \u03bbm! hhq m ii = h i ln[1 + Ti (e\u03bb \u2212 1)]i.\nOne finds that the first cumulant, hhqii = nhT1 i, gives the\nconductance, the RMT average of which is known4 to be\nhhqii \u2261 hgi =\n\nN1 N2\nN \u22121+\n\n2\n\u03b2\n\n,\n\nN \u2261 N1 + N2 ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhile hhq 2 ii = n(hT1 i \u2212 hT12 i) yields shot-noise as follows6\nhhq 2 ii \u2261 hpi = hgi\n\n(N1 \u2212 1 + \u03b22 )(N2 \u2212 1 + \u03b22 )\n(N \u2212 2 + \u03b22 )(N \u2212 1 + \u03b24 )\n\n.\n\n(5)\n\nAn equivalent to RMT derivation of these and related results\nwithin a semiclassical approach may be found in Ref. 13.\nThe charge cumulants are an example of linear statistics on\nthe Ti 's that is fully determined\nby the transmission eigenP\nvalue density, \u03c1(T ) = h i \u03b4(T \u2212 Ti )i. However, the latter\n\n\f2\nis analytically known only in some limiting cases of a few4,14\nor many15 open channels, restricting the use of \u03c1(T ) for the\ncalculation of hhq m ii and full counting statistics16,17 to these\ncases.\nIn the general situation of arbitrary N1,2 , one can alternatively consider the joint probability distribution (2) and exploit its simple algebraic structure (i.e. that of the Selberg's\nintegral kernel) to derive exact relations for its moments.6 For\nexample, Eqs. (15) and (16) presented below yield straightforwardly and in a uniform way exact results (4), (5) and (9)\nfor hgi, hpi and var(g), respectively. This approach was recently extended further to find the third cumulant hhq 3 ii =\nh(q \u2212hqi)3 i exactly.8 For completeness and later use, we write\ndown this result (following from Eq. (18) below) as follows\n(1 \u2212 \u03b22 )2 \u2212 (N1 \u2212 N2 )2\nhhq 3 ii\n.\n=\nvar(q)\n(N \u2212 3 + \u03b22 )(N \u2212 1 + \u03b26 )\n\n(6)\n\nAs to the fourth cumulant of the transmitted charge, its explicit expression can be found from Eqs. (15) \u2013 (19) according\nto hhq 4 ii = n[hT1 i\u22127hT12 i+12hT13 i\u22126hT14 i], the result being\ntoo lengthy to be reported here. In the case of the single-mode\n2\n1\n1\nleads, N1 = N2 = 1, one gets hhq 4 ii = \u2212 105\n, \u2212 30\n, \u2212 30\nat\nthe values of \u03b2 = 1, 2, 4, respectively. In the opposite semiclassical limit of many channels, N1,2 \u226b 1, we represent the\noutcome of our calculation as the following N1 expansion:\nN14 \u2212 8N1 N23 + 12N12 N22 \u2212 8N13 N2 + N24\nhhq 4 ii\n=\nvar(q)\nN4\n6(\u03b2 \u2212 2)(N1 \u2212 N2 )2 (2N12 \u2212 7N1 N2 + 2N22 )\n+\n\u03b2N 5\n2\n+O(1/N ) .\n(7)\nThe leading order term agrees with the result obtained by a\ndifferent method in Ref.16 The next order term gives a week\nlocalization correction which vanishes at \u03b2 = 2 or N1 = N2 .\nIn the latter case of symmetric cavities, one further finds\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u00101 \u0011\n\u03b2 2 \u2212 6\u03b2 + 4\nn\n4\n1\u2212\n+\nO\n.\n(8)\nhhq ii =\n64\n2\u03b2 2 n2\nn2\nConductance cumulants.\u2013 As is clear from the discussion,\nthe presented method is equally applied to nonlinear statistics determined by different transmission eigenvalues as well.\nThe simplest example of such a quantity is the variance of the\nconductance, the exact RMT result of which reads1,6\n2(N1 \u2212 1 + \u03b22 )(N2 \u2212 1 + \u03b22 )\nvar(g)\n. (9)\n=\nhgi\n\u03b2(N \u2212 2 + \u03b22 )(N \u2212 1 + \u03b22 )(N \u2212 1 + \u03b24 )\nWe note that var(g) = 2hgihpi/\u03b2N1 N2 makes a relation of\n(9) to the linear statics (4) and (5) considered above.\nThe third cumulant of the conductance, the so-called skewness, can be also found from Eqs. (15) \u2013 (18) and be represented after some algebra in the following compact form:\n4[(1 \u2212 \u03b22 )2 \u2212 (N1 \u2212 N2 )2 ]\nhhg 3 ii\n=\n. (10)\nvar(g)\n\u03b2(N \u2212 3 + \u03b22 )(N \u2212 1 + \u03b22 )(N \u2212 1 + \u03b26 )\n\nOne finds immediately that hhg 3 ii = 8[hgi/\u03b2N1 N2 ]2 hhq 3 ii.\nIt is also worth noting that the skewness vanishes for symmetric cavities (N1 = N2 ) at \u03b2 = 2. This holds generally for any\nodd cumulant of g (or q), as the corresponding distribution\nbecomes symmetric around n2 (or 21 ) in this case.18\nBy our method, we have also calculated the fourth cumulant hhg 4 ii which is related to the conductance kurtosis. The\nfourth moment of the conductance is found to be determined\nby moments of Ti 's as hg 4 i = n[hT14 i + (n \u2212 1)(3hT12 T22 i +\n4hT1 T23 i) + 6(n \u2212 1)(n \u2212 2)hT1 T2 T32 i + (n \u2212 1)(n \u2212 2)(n \u2212\n3)hT1 T2 T3 T4 i], the corresponding cumulant being given by\nthe standard formula. Since the resulting explicit expression\nappears to be too cumbersome, we restrict our consideration\nto the limiting cases of the single-mode and many-mode leads.\n32\n1\n1\nIn the former case, we get hhg 4 ii = \u2212 4725\n, \u2212 120\n, \u2212 540\nat \u03b2 = 1, 2, 4, respectively, whereas in the latter case of\nN1,2 \u226b 1 we arrive at the following expression:\n24 h\nhhg 4 ii\n= 2 6 (N1 \u2212 N2 )2 (N12 + N22 \u2212 4N1 N2 )\nvar(g)\n\u03b2 N\n\u03b2 \u2212 2\u0010\n12(N14 + N24 ) \u2212 64N1 N2 (N12 + N22 )\n+\n\u03b2N\n\u0011i\n+105N12N22 + O(1/N 4 ) .\n(11)\nOne can readily see that higher cumulants contribute in the\nnext order of N1 , thus the conductance distribution gets more\nGaussian-like as N grows.19 This tendency becomes even\nstronger for symmetric cavities at \u03b2 = 2, as then hhg 3 ii = 0\nidentically and hhg 4 ii vanishes in the leading and next-toleading orders. In this case of N1,2 = n \u226b 1, one gets\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u00101 \u0011\n3\n2\n(\u03b2 + 2)2\n+\nO\nhhg 4 ii =\n1\n\u2212\n.\n+\n128\u03b2 3 n3\n\u03b2\n2\u03b2 2 n\nn5\n(12)\nShot-noise variance.\u2013 Now we discuss statistics of the shotnoise power. Its average value is given by (5), whereas its\nsecond cumulant, the variance, is determined by var(p) =\nn[hT12 i \u2212 2hT13 i + hT14 i] + n(n \u2212 1)[hT1 T2 i \u2212 2hT1 T22 i +\nhT12 T22 i] \u2212 n2 [hT1 i \u2212 hT12 i]2 . However, as in all other cases\nof the fourth order cumulants considered above, the explicit\nresult for var(p) can not be cast in a compact form, so we\npresent the limiting cases again.

The cumulants up to the fourth order for current\nand conductance fluctuations and up to the second order for\nshot-noise have been calculated exactly at arbitrary channel\nnumbers and symmetry parameter \u03b2. We note that the proposed method can be also used for determining the corresponding distributions in closed form suitable for an analytic\nwork in the case of a few open channels as well as for numerical implementations.7,20 Our analysis of shot-noise statistics suggests that in close analogy with universal conductance\nfluctuations,19 we may characterize universal fluctuations of\nshot-noise by their cumulants as follows\nm\n\n2\u2212m\n\nhhp ii \u221d hpi\n\n.\n\n(21)\n\nIn the limit of large (and equal) channel numbers, Eq. (21)\nyields the Gaussian distribution which is peaked at hpi \u2248 n4\n1\nand has a width given by the universal value of var(p) \u2248 64\u03b2\n.\nIt would be highly interesting to understand how our findings,\nwhich are relevant to the zero-dimensional (RMT) case, can\nbe extended to higher dimensions where some analytical results are already known.21,22\nIt would be also desirable to compare our results with the\n\n1\n2\n3\n\n4\n5\n\n6\n7\n\n8\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\nC.

For example, measurements of\nup to the fifth cumulants of the transmitted charge have been\nrecently done in a weakly coupled quantum dot.23 However,\nperforming similar experiments for a lower impedance device,\nsuch as a perfectly open chaotic cavity with several modes in\nthe leads, requires a much higher detector resolution that represents a current experimental challenge. On the other hand,\nthe conductance distribution in chaotic cavities24 has been\nalso tested by means of experiments with microwaves.25 A\ndirect comparison with our results in this case could be, however, not so straightforward, as it involves taking into account\neffects of dephasing and absorption24,26 as well.\nAs another potential application of our results, we mention quantized transport in graphene p-n junctions that\nhas been very recently studied both experimentally27 and\ntheoretically.28 The exact RMT results for higher cumulants\nof the conductance and noise may be useful for understanding possible mechanisms of edge mode mixing in the bipolar\nregime leading to chaotic transport there.28 Further work in\nthis and in the other directions mentioned above is needed.\nWe thank K.
