The evolution of the mass-to-light ratio of AGN host galaxies shows a similar trend to\nthat observed in normal early-type galaxies, consistent with single-burst passive evolution models\nwith formation redshifts z & 1. The lack of a significant difference between normal and AGN host\ngalaxies in the Fundamental plane supports the \"Grand Unification\" picture wherein AGNs are\na transient phase in the evolution of normal galaxies. The black hole masses of BL Lac objects\nand radio galaxies, derived using the mass \u2013 dispersion relation, are similar. The black hole mass\nis independent of BL Lac type. The local black hole mass \u2013 host galaxy luminosity relation of\nour sub-sample at z < 0.1 is similar to that of local normal and radio galaxies, but is less well\ndefined at higher redshift due to the luminosity evolution of the host galaxies.\nSubject headings: galaxies: active - galaxies: formation - - galaxies: evolution - quasars: general - black\nhole physics -BL Lacertae objects\n\n1.\n\nholes (Kormendy & Gebhardt 2001), suggesting\nAGNs are a transient phase in the evolution of normal galaxies (Cavaliere & Padovani 1989). This\n\"Grand Unification\" hypothesis is supported by\nseveral lines of evidence. First, the peak of black\nhole mass growth, which manifests the maximum\nAGN activity at z \u223c 2, is similar to the peak\nof the star formation rate (e.g., Dunlop 1999;\nMiyaji, Hashinger, & Schmidt et al. 2000, Wolf\net al. 2003a, Wolf et al. 2003b). In individual AGNs, starburst activity is not uncommon,\nand may be more prevalent than in normal galaxies (Tadhunter, Dickson & Shaw 1996; Melnick,\nGopal-Krishna & Terlevich 1997; Aretxaga et al.\n2001). This apparent association of star formation\nand AGN activity suggests that the formation of\nthe galaxy bulge could simultaneously trigger star\nformation and significant accretion onto a seed\nblack hole.\nSecond, the total local black hole mass, estimated from inactive black holes at the cen-\n\nIntroduction\n\nActive galactic nuclei (AGNs) and inactive\ngalaxies seem to be closely connected.

This relation,\nbetween black hole mass (M\u2022 ) and bulge stellar velocity dispersion (\u03c3), indicates that somehow the\nsmall-scale black hole knows the large-scale galaxy\nproperties, and vice versa, further supporting a\nphysical connection between galaxy formation and\nblack hole accretion.\nFinally, AGN host galaxies show the same M\u2022 -\u03c3\ncorrelation (Gebhardt et al. 2000b; Ferrarese et al.\n2001). In this case, black hole masses are derived\nfrom reverberation mapping results, which gives\none of the most reliable AGN black hole mass measurements (Peterson 1993), suggesting the overall\nformation processes for black holes and galaxies\nare the same for normal and AGN host galaxies.\nAccordingly, we started a program to test the\nGrand Unification hypothesis, by studying AGN\nhost galaxies directly. Specifically, we investigate\nthe Fundamental Plane of AGN host galaxies, to\nsee whether they obey the same tight correlation\namong half light radius (re ), surface brightness\n(\u03bce ), and central velocity dispersion (\u03c3) as normal\ngalaxies. Already it is known that early-type AGN\nhost galaxies, especially radio-loud AGN hosts,\nfollow the Kormendy relation, which is a projection onto the re \u2013 \u03bce plane (Taylor et al. 1996;\nUrry et al. 2000; O'Dowd, Urry & Scarpa 2002;\nDunlop et al. 2003). However, this two-parameter\nrelation has larger scatter than the Fundamental\nPlane (Dressler et al. 1987; Djorgovski & Davis\n1987; Faber et al. 1987), and lacks the third dimension, namely, velocity dispersion. The empirical scaling relation, among re , \u03bce , and \u03c3 observed\nin normal galaxies is interpreted as evidence that\nearly-type galaxies form a homologous family with\na power-law relation between galaxy mass and the\nmass-to-light ratio. Due to the very low internal\nscatter, the Fundamental Plane is often used to\nstudy galaxy formation (Franx 1993; Jorgensen et\n\nal. 1996; van Dokkum & Stanford 2003), and it is\na much more direct probe of the similarities and\ndifferences between normal and AGN host galaxies. Thus, we initiated a program to measure \u03c3 in\nthe host galaxies of AGN.\nUltimately the Fundamental Plane must be\nprobed at moderate to high redshift, where AGN\nare more numerous. Here we push to z \u223c 0.3,\nroughly three times as high as most previously\npublished measurements (Bettoni et al. 2001;\nBarth et al. 2002; Falome et al. 2003). Specifically, we report observations and velocity dispersion measurements for 15 AGN host galaxies\nfrom z = 0.05 to z = 0.34. Combining with 11\npublished dispersion measurements, we investigate\nwhether early-type AGN host galaxies lie on the\nsame Fundamental Plane as normal galaxies, and\nhow the mass-to-light ratio of AGN hosts evolves\nrelative to that of normal galaxies. In \u00a7 2, we\ndescribe the observations and velocity dispersion\nmeasurements, and in \u00a7 3, the Fundamental Plane\nand its evolution. In \u00a7 4, we discuss black hole\nmasses, and in \u00a7 5 we present the discussion and\nconclusions. The correlations of black hole mass\nwith other AGN properties will be discussed in detail in a subsequent paper (Woo et al. 2004). We\nadopt a cosmology with \u03a9 = 0.3, \u039b = 0.7, and\nHo = 70 km sec\u22121 Mpc\u22121 .\n2.\n2.1.\n\nOBSERVATIONS and DATA REDUCTION\nSample Selection and Observation\n\nAGN host galaxies are more difficult to study\nthan normal galaxies due to the presence of bright\ncentral sources. To determine the structural parameters, re , and \u03bce , it is necessary to subtract the\nAGN contribution from a host galaxy, which then\ncan be analyzed as a normal galaxy. Given the importance of high spatial resolution, our first sample selection criterion was to choose HST-imaged\nAGN host galaxies, for which reliable structural\nparameters are already available.\nSecond, we chose low ratios for the AGN-togalaxy luminosity. Stellar absorption lines are\nmuch harder to detect from a typical bright AGN\nspectrum because the brighter nuclear continuum\nhides stellar lines and increases noise, and AGN\nbroad emission lines hamper the determination\nof the velocity dispersion from stellar absorption\n2\n\n\fchanged in order to cover different wavelength\nranges, all calibration frames were also taken\nagain. Arc lamp spectra were taken in the afternoon for an initial wavelength solution, and at\neach telescope position during the night before\nand/or after target exposures, in order to check\nany systematic changes.\nLate type (G8-K5) giant stars with low radial\nvelocity (< 20 km/sec) were selected as template\nstars. These stars were observed for each instrument setup, mostly at twilight. Smaller slit widths\nwere used for template star observations in order\nto obtain a sufficiently high spectral resolution so\nthat the Gaussian velocity dispersions of galaxies\nand the redshifted templates are comparable.\nTotal exposure times of 1 to 3.5 hours were used\ndepending on the host galaxy magnitude. Each\ntotal exposure time was typically divided into 30\nminute exposures to remove cosmic rays and avoid\nCCD saturation in the presence of bright nuclei.\n\nlines. Indeed, we initially observed several typical\nbright AGNs with faint host galaxies, but failed to\nget reliable stellar signatures even with very high\nS/N ratios in the observed spectra. We concluded\nthat it is not possible to measure the stellar velocity dispersion for host galaxies of bright AGNs using the present observational techniques (see also\nBarth et al. 2002). Therefore, we chose BL Lac\nobjects and radio galaxies, which typically do not\nhave strong emission lines, and whose luminosity\nis comparable to or smaller than the galaxy light.\nThird, we selected low to intermediate redshift\n(z . 0.4) objects. With 4-6m class telescopes\nand typical exposure times of a couple of hours,\nz \u223c 0.4 \u2212 0.5 is the approximate upper limit for\nmeasuring bulge stellar velocity dispersion in AGN\nhost galaxies.\nStarting with the sample of 110 BL Lac objects observed with HST (Urry et al. 2000), we\nselected early-type host galaxies at z < 0.4 giving\n\u223c 30 BL Lac hosts in the southern and northern\nhemispheres. In addition, we selected several wellstudied radio galaxies at similar redshifts, which\nwere also previously observed with HST.\nThe spectra were obtained with the 6.5-m Magellan Clay Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory, the CTIO 4-m telescope, and the KPNO 4-m\ntelescope during February to October 2003. Table\n1 shows the details of instrumental setups and the\njournal of observations. We used the B&C longslit spectrograph at the Magellan Telescope and\nthe RC long-slit spectrograph at the CTIO and\nKPNO telescopes. The instrumental setups were\nchosen to cover strong stellar absorption lines,\nsuch as G-band (4300 \u00c5), Mgb triplet (around\n5172 \u00c5), Ca+Fe (around 5269 \u00c5), and NaD lines\n(5892 \u00c5) depending on the redshift, and to provide sufficient instrumental resolution, . 100 km\nsec\u22121 (Gaussian dispersion), so that the expected\nvelocity dispersions ranging 150 to 350 km sec\u22121\nfor our target galaxies could be reliably recovered.\nSky conditions were mostly photometric with\nexcellent seeing, with the exception of a few nights\nwhen intermittent thin clouds were present. We\nused a 1\u2032\u2032 slit width for most of the runs. For the\nKPNO run we used a 1.2\u2032\u2032 slit width due to worse\nseeing conditions.\nBias frames and flat fields were taken in the\nafternoon. When the grating angle had to be\n\n2.2.\n\nData Reduction and Dispersion Measurement\n\nThe standard data reduction procedures, such\nas bias subtraction, flat-fielding, spectral extraction, and wavelength calibration, were performed\nwith IRAF routines. A one-dimensional spectrum\nwas extracted from each exposure, using aperture\nsizes similar to or smaller than the effective radius\nof each host galaxy (Table 2). Extracted spectra were combined to make the final spectrum for\neach galaxy. Out of 18 observed AGN hosts, 3\ngalaxies were removed from further analysis since\nthe signal-to-noise ratios of galaxy absorption lines\nwere not sufficient to measure the velocity dispersion. The signal-to-noise ratio of the final sample\nranges from 25 to \u223c 400 per pixel (see Table 1 for\nthe plate scale), high enough to measure stellar\nvelocity dispersions.\nWe used a direct fitting method, in which the\nobserved spectrum is directly fitted in pixel space\nwith broadened template spectra. The best-fitting\ndispersion values are determined by the smallest\n\u03c72 number. This method is widely used (van der\nMarel 1994; Rix et al. 1995; Kelson et al. 2000a;\nBarth et al. 2002), and has an advantage of easily removing bad pixels and AGN emission lines\nby masking out specific spectral regions in pixel\nspace.\n\n3\n\n\ftriplet mismatch is partially caused by a difference in \u03b1-enhancement between stars in massive\ngalaxies and Galactic stars (Barth et al. 2002).\nWe note that the [N I] emission line, which in\nsome case, is clearly present on the red side of the\nMgb triplet, will also hamper a good fit around\nthe Mgb triplet region. The issue of whether more\naccurate values of the velocity dispersion are obtained when the Mgb triplet lines are included or\nexcluded was addressed in detail by Barth et al.\n(2002). They found that more accurate results are\nobtained when the lines are excluded, and we have\nfollowed this advice. In principle it would be interesting to provide an independent verification of\nthis finding, and to analyze in more detail what\naspects of the stellar and abundance composition\nof the galaxies are the cause of this. However, this\nis beyond the scope of the present paper. It would\nalso require a larger sample of higher S/N spectra.\nThe measured velocity dispersions (\u03c3m ) are corrected for differences in instrumental resolution\nbetween the galaxy and template spectra using\n(van der Marel et al. 1997):\n\nFor the fitting procedure featureless continua\nwith various slopes were added to the template\nstar spectra to account for the possible presence of\nan AGN non-stellar continuum, which changes the\nline strength as a function of wavelength. The observed galaxy and template star spectra were then\nnormalised by divinding by a continuum fit and\nre-binned logarithmically. Thus, a set of template\nspectra with various slopes were prepared for each\ntemplate star. Finally the template spectra were\nconvolved with Gaussian velocity profiles with 50400 km sec\u22121 , and fitted to the normalized galaxy\nspectrum using the Gauss-Hermite Pixel Fitting\nsoftware1, which is described in Appendix A of\nvan der Marel (1994).\nThe fitting software uses various polynomial orders and line strength parameters to match galaxy\nspectra, and determines the best \u03c72 fit, which\ngives the velocity dispersion measurement. Bad\npixels (especially for CTIO 4m data), galactic absorption lines, and various emission lines (e.g.,\nclearly present H\u03b2 and [OIII] lines) were masked\nout before fitting.\nExtensive and careful fitting with various spectral regions, such as G-band, H\u03b2, Mgb triplet, and\nNaD line regions, were performed to determine the\nbest-fitting spectral range. We used the G-band\nregion for many galaxies, and a larger spectral\nrange containing from the G-band to the Ca+Fe\nlines was chosen for 6 galaxies. Various polynomial orders and continuum slopes were used for\nfitting to test any dependence on the parameters.\nDeviations with these parameters are similar to\ntypical measurement errors. Changing the spectral type of the template stars gives a larger variation in the velocity dispersion. After fitting with\neach individual and combined template spectrum,\nwe chose the best-template star with the smallest\n\u03c72 for each galaxy. Figure 1 shows the host galaxy\nspectra with the best-fitting template.\nLike Barth et al. (2002), we found that Mgb\ntriplet cannot be fit together with nearby lines\nsuch as Fe 5270 and Fe 5335 blends. The Mgb\ntriplet is much deeper in the galaxy spectrum than\nin the stellar template. However, when we exclude the Mgb triplet, the overall fit was very\ngood. Thus, in those cases we masked out the Mgb\ntriplet for the final fitting (see Fig. 1a). The Mgb\n1 available\n\n(\u03c3vel )2 = (\u03c3m )2 \u2212 [(\u03c3inst,G )2 \u2212 (\u03c3inst,T )2 ]. (1)\nHere, \u03c3m is the measured velocity dispersion from\nthe fitting, and \u03c3inst,G and \u03c3inst,T are the instrumental resolutions of galaxy and template spectra,\nrespectively. Note that the instrumental resolution in km sec\u22121 unit is independent of redshift.\nFor nearby galaxies, this correction is unnecessary because the instrumental setup of template\nand galaxy spectra are the same. However, this is\nnot the case for high-redshfit galaxies because template stars and galaxies are observed at different\nspectral ranges, and thus, the instrumental resolution of the template stars should be matched to\nthat of galaxy spectrum (van Dokkum et al. 1996;\nKelson et al. 2000a).\nFigure 2 shows an example of instrumental resolution as a function of wavelength for each instrumental setup of our Magellan run. The resolution\nin \u00c5 of the template spectrum is 10 \u2212 20% better than that of the galaxy spectrum because of\nthe smaller slit width (0.7\u2032\u2032 ). Since the template\nspectrum resolution is very similar to that of the\ngalaxy spectrum when the template spectrum is\nredshifted for fitting, the correction for the difference in instrumental resolutions is very small.\n\nat http://www.stsci.edu/\u223cmarel/software.html\n\n4\n\n\fWe derived instrumental resolutions at the center of each fitting spectral range for each galaxy\nand corrected the galaxy velocity dispersions with\nEquation (1). Typical correction values are a few\nkm/sec. We report corrected velocity dispersions\nand aperture radii for 15 AGN host galaxies in\nTable 2.\nThe velocity dispersion of AP Lib (1514-241)\nwas measured previously by two groups, Barth\net al. (2002) and Falomo et al. (2003), who reported dispersions 196 \u00b1 12 km sec\u22121 and 250 \u00b1 12\nkm sec\u22121 , respectively. Several other BL Lac objects have large discrepancies between the measurements of those two groups as well. The source\nof the large (4\u03c3) discrepancy is unclear. Our measurement for AP Lib, \u03c3 = 242\u00b17 km sec\u22121 , agrees\nvery well with the value of Falomo et al. (2003).\n3.\n\net al. (2003), we took the mean of the logarithms\nof the two dispersions. The errors in the mean\nwas calculated by propagation of the errors in the\nindividual measurements (see Table 3). Note that\nthis might underestimate the true errors, given\nthat some of the values of Barth et al. (2002) and\nFalomo et al. (2003) are not mutually consistent\nwithin the errors. However, this does not affect\nthe results of our further analysis.\nFor this sample of 26 galaxies, structural parameters are collected from the literature. The re\nand total galaxy magnitudes are taken from the\nHST snapshot survey of BL Lac objects (Urry et\nal. 2000), with a few exceptions in which the HSTmeasured host galaxy size (re ) is more than factor\nof 2 smaller than the ground-based result. These\n4 cases, namely Mrk 180, Mrk 421, Mrk 501, and\n3C 371, are all at very low redshift (z . 0.05) and\nhave large effective radii, re & 10\u2032\u2032 . Due to the\nsmall field of view of WFPC2, overestimated sky\nbackground would lead to an underestimate of re\n(Barth et al. 2002; Falomo et al. 2003). Thus, for\nthese four cases, we took the median of all available re data from Falomo et al. (2003). The mean\nsurface brightness within the re is derived from\nthe total magnitude of the host galaxy using:\n\nThe Fundamental Plane of AGN Host\nGalaxies\n\nSince the Fundamental Plane is well established\namong early-type galaxies in nearby clusters (e.g.,\nJorgensen et al. 1996), it has become a tool to\nstudy the formation and evolution of normal earlytype galaxies. AGN host galaxies, at least at\nvery low redshifts, also show the same scaling relation. Bettoni et al. (2001) measured and collected data for 72 radio galaxies and showed that\nthese low redshift (< z >\u223c 0.04) galaxies lie on\nthe Fundamental Plane. Barth et al. (2002) and\nFalomo et al. (2003) measured bulge stellar velocity dispersions for a sample of \u223c 10 low redshift\n(< z >\u223c 0.06) BL Lac objects and showed they lie\non the same Fundamental Plane as normal galaxies. Here, we compare the Fundamental Plane of\nAGN host galaxies in our higher redshift sample\nwith that of low-redshift radio and normal galaxies.\nWe measured and collected dynamical and\nstructural parameters for a sample of 26 AGN host\ngalaxies (23 BL Lac objects and 3 radio galaxies),\ncombining our new higher redshift data with 11\npublished dispersion measurements from Barth et\nal. (2002) and Falomo et al. (2003). The velocity\ndispersions were corrected to a common aperture\nequivalent to 3.4\u2032\u2032 at the distance of the Coma\ncluster (z = 0.023), based on the empirical prescription of Jorgensen et al. (1995). For several\ncommon objects in Barth et al. (2002) and Falomo\n\n< \u03bce >= mt +5log(re )+2.5log(2\u03c0)\u2212AR \u2212K\u22122.5log(1+z)4 .\n(2)\nHere, mt is the total host galaxy magnitude measured in the Cousins R band (Urry et al. 2000),2\nre is the effective radius in arcsec, AR is extinction in the R band taken from the NED database3\n(Schlegel et al. 1998), and K is the K correction\nvalue interpolated from Poggianti et al. (1997).\n3.1.\n\nComparing with Radio and Normal\nGalaxies\n\nRadio galaxies and BL Lac objects are believed\nto constitute the same AGN family with different orientation angles (Urry & Padovani 1995).\nHere we compare the Fundamental Plane of the\nBettoni sample of radio galaxies along with our\n2 Note\n\nthat the published surface brightness in Table 2 of\nUrry et al. (2000) is not extinction corrected.\n3 The NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED) is operated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute\nof Technology, under contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\n\n5\n\n\fAGN sample in Figure 3. The two panels correspond to two different edge-on projections. The\naxes of the two panels are such that the 72 radio\ngalaxies of Bettoni et al. (2001) are viewed edgeon. The dashed line is the Fundamental Plane\nfit defined for 72 radio galaxies (small dots) in\nBettoni et al. (2001), who demonstrated that radio galaxies lie on the same Fundamental Plane\nas normal early-type galaxies although the actual\ndata points (small dots) present significant scatter\n(0.19 in log re ), probably due to the data quality and uncertainties in color transformation. The\ntwenty-three BL Lac hosts and 3 radio galaxies in\nour sample also follow the same correlation. All\nscales (in this figure only) are corrected to Ho = 50\nkm sec\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , and qo = 0 for consistency with\nBettoni et al. (2001). Our dispersion measurements (filled circles) show a similar trend to that\nobserved by Barth et al. (2002) and Falomo et al.\n(2003; open circles). We do not find any significant difference in the Fundamental Plane between\nBL Lac hosts and radio galaxies. The RMS scatter in our sample is 0.103 in log re . Substracting\nthe measurement errors in quadrature, we find the\nintrinsic scatter to be 0.071 in log re .\nWe also compare the normal galaxy Fundamental Plane with that of AGN host galaxies to test\nthe \"Grand Unification\" picture. Figure 4 shows\ntwo edge-on projections of the Fundamental Plane.\nThe axes of the two panels are such that the\nComa cluster galaxies in Jorgensen et al. (1996)\nare viewed edge-on. The dashed line is a fit to\nthe Coma cluster galaxies (small dots) from Jorgensen et al. (1996). Our sample of AGN host\ngalaxies, converted from the Cousins R band to\nthe Gunn r band assuming r-R=0.35 (Jorgensen\n1994) are plotted with different symbols based on\nredshift. This figure shows that AGN host galaxies lie on the same Fundamental Plane as normal\ngalaxies. The higher redshift host galaxies lie below the dashed line because the surface brightness is brighter on average due to the younger\nstellar populations, assuming re and \u03c3 are not\nchanged. This trend is also seen in cluster and\nfield early-type galaxies in similar redshift ranges\n(van Dokkum et al. 1996; Treu et al. 2001), and\ncorresponds to an evolution of the Fundamental\nPlane. By correcting passive luminosity evolution\nwith a stellar population synthesis model with formation redshift zf orm = 2, the Fundamental Plane\n\nbecomes tighter (see \u00a7 3.2).\n3.2.\n\nMass-to-light ratio evolution\n\nThe mass-to-light ratio is a fundamental property of galaxies and a basic tool for studying\ngalaxy evolution (Franx 1993). If early-type galaxies formed at relatively high redshift and evolved\npassively afterward, the evolution of the Fundamental Plane is simply caused by the dimming\nof surface brightness due to the aging of the stellar population (Tinsley & Gunn 1976). However,\nif early-type galaxies experience mergers at relatively low redshift, the evolution of the Fundamental Plane will be different due to the ensuing star\nformation. Thus, the study of the mass-to-light ratio evolution through the Fundamental Plane can\nconstrain the galaxy formation history.\nVarious recent studies of high redshift (up to\nz \u223c 1) early-type galaxies have attempted to test\ngalaxy formation scenarios (e.g., monolithic collapse versus merging models) by estimating the\nstar formation epoch, showing that field and cluster early-type galaxies formed at z & 1 and\nevolved passively afterward (Kelson et al. 2000b;\nTreu et al. 2001; van Dokkum et al. 2001; Treu et\nal. 2002; Gebhardt et al. 2003; Rusin et al. 2003;\nvan Dokkum & Stanford 2003; van der Wel et al.\n2004). The evolution of the mass-to-light ratio in\nearly-type cluster galaxies (0.02 < z < 1.27) is\nconsistent with a single burst of star formation at\nz \u223c 2\u20133, but we note that at higher redshift the\npicture may be more complex. One of 3 galaxies at z = 1.27 shows much lower mass-to-light\nratio and strong Balmer absorption lines, indicating a younger stellar population than predicted\nwith zf orm = 2\u20133 models (van Dokkum & Stanford 2003).\nIn the case of early-type field galaxies, the formation redshift ranges from z \u223c 1\u20133, with at least\nsome observational studies reporting that earlytype field galaxies show a steeper mass-to-light\nratio evolution (van Dokkum et al. 2001; Treu\net al. 2002; Gebhardt et al. 2003). This suggests the average age of their stellar population is\nyounger than that of cluster galaxies, qualitatively\nconsistent with hierarchical merging models that\npredict early-types in the field formed later than in\nclusters due to the less dense environment (Kauffman 1996; Diaferio et al. 2001). However, the\nage difference between field and cluster galaxies,\n6\n\n\fulation synthesis models with the Salpeter IMF\n(Bruzual & Charlot 2003). The star formation\nrate is assumed to be exponentially decreasing:\n\nestimated from the observed mass-to-light ratios,\nis much smaller than predicted with hierarchical\nmerging models (van Dokkum et al. 2001; Treu\n2004). It is not even clear whether field galaxies formed later than cluster galaxies, since other\nstudies suggest that field and cluster early-type\ngalaxies have a comparable formation epoch with\nsimilar stellar population ages (van Dokkum & Ellis 2003; Rusin et al. 2003). At each epoch of\nobservation there are plausibly various early-type\ngalaxies with stellar populations formed at different epochs (zf orm = 1-3), since there is a large\nscatter in the mass-to-light ratio among field earlytype galaxies up to z \u223c 1, indicating a significant\nage spread among field galaxies (van de Ven et al.\n2003; van der Wel et al. 2004).\nIf AGN host galaxies are fundamentally normal\ngalaxies with an active nucleus, the evolution of\nthe mass-to-light ratio should be similar to that\nof normal galaxies. In this section, we investigate\nthe mass-to-light ratio evolution of our sample of\n26 AGN host galaxies.\nBecause of the virial theorem, galaxy masses\ncan be derived with\nM = K \u03c3 2 re / G,\n\nSF R \u221d exp\u2212t\n\n,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere t is the time elapsed since the galaxy formed\nand \u03c4 is the e-folding time of the star formation\nrate.\nFigure 5 shows the passive evolution model predictions of the mass-to-light ratio in the Gunn r\nband, depending on the formation redshift and \u03c4 .\nTo address the evolution of AGN hosts we compare high-redshift hosts to low-redshift hosts. We\ndefine \u2206 log(M/L) to be difference in logarithm\nbetween the M/L at a certain redshift and the\nM/L in our lowest AGN host redshift bin, which\nis centered on z = 0.046. The Figure shows both\nthe mass-to-light ratio of individual host galaxies\n(open circles) and the averaged M/L values over\neach redshift bin (filled circles). There is a clear\nM/L decrease as a function of redshift. The massto-light ratio at z = 0.046 corresponds to a 38%\nincrease since z = 0.324, which can be reproduced\nby a single burst model with zf orm \u223c 2, although\nthe data points are consistent with the passive\nevolution models of zf orm & 1 within the 68 %\nconfidence limit based on \u03c72 analysis. The massto-light ratio evolution in the Gunn r band corresponds to \u2206log(M/Lr )/\u2206z = \u22120.51 \u00b1 0.18. Using the stellar population models consistent with\nthis value, we estimated the M/L evolution in the\nrest-frame B band, \u2206log(M/LB )/\u2206z \u223c \u22120.62.\nThe trend of the M/L evolution of our AGN host\ngalaxies is similar to that of normal galaxies in\nthe field and clusters with star formation epoch\nat zf orm = 1-3 (\u2206log(M/LB )/\u2206z = 0.46\u20130.72;\nTreu et al. 2002; Rusin et al. 2003; van de Ven\net al. 2003; van Dokkum & Stanford 2003). A\nlarger sample of higher redshift (z > 0.3) galaxies is clearly required to narrow down the formation epoch of AGN host galaxies (O'Dowd & Urry\n2004). We note, however, that a higher zf orm\nmodel with extended star formation (thin-solid\nline) and a lower zf orm single burst model (dashed\nline) predict the very similar mass-to-light ratio\nevolution, especially at low redshift.\nCorrecting the surface brightness of the galaxies\nin our sample using the single burst model (with\nzf orm = 2) predictions for the M/L evolution, as\nin Figure 4, the Fundamental Plane shows a tight\n\n(3)\n\nwhere K is a constant and re is the effective radius.\nBy definition, the luminosity of a galaxy is given\nby L = 2\u03c0re2 Ie , where Ie is the average surface\nbrightness within the effective radius. Hence, the\nmass-to-light ratio is given by\nlog M/L = 2 log \u03c3 \u2212 log Ie \u2212 log re + C,\n\n/ \u03c4\n\n(4)\n\nwhere, the constant C = log(K/2\u03c0G). In the\nGunn r band, log Ie \u2261 \u22120.4(< \u03bce > \u221226.4), where\nIe is in L\u2299 pc\u22122 and \u03bce is the surface brightness in\nmag arcsec\u22122 (Jorgensen et al. 1996). If galaxies\nevolve without merging or accretion, the mass-tolight ratio evolves due to the luminosity evolution\nof the stellar populations while the mass, \u03c3, and\nre remain the same (van Dokkum & Franx 1996).\nUsing these relations, we estimated the mass-tolight ratio for each host galaxy, and its evolution\nby normalizing it with the Fundamental Plane of\nthe Coma cluster galaxies. All parameters were\ncorrected to a common set of cosmological parameters, Ho = 70 km sec\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , \u03a9 = 0.3, and\n\u039b = 0.7.\nWe also modeled the evolution of the mass-tolight ratio in the Gunn r band using stellar pop7\n\n\fcorrelation within RMS scatter 0.095 in log re .\nSubtracting the measurement errors in quadrature, we find the intrinsic scatter of the Fundamental Plane to be 0.080 in log re , which is close\nto the intrinsic scatter, 0.070, of the Fundamental\nPlane of nearby clusters (Jorgensen et al. 1996).\nWe also estimated each galaxy mass using\nEquation (3), with K = 5 as suggested by Bender\net al. (1992). AGN host galaxies show the same\ntrend as normal galaxies in that more massive\ngalaxies have larger mass-to-light ratios (Fig. 6).\nUsing the luminosity correction with zf orm = 2\nmodel, we obtain M/L \u221d M 0.38\u00b10.06 , which is\nsimilar to that of normal galaxies (Jorgensen et\nal. 1996)\nWe conclude that there is no significant difference of the M/L evolution between normal and\nAGN host galaxies. The AGN host galaxies show\nthe same Fundamental Plane, the same M/L relation, and a similar star formation epoch.\n4.\n\nIn Figure 7, we show the distribution of black\nhole masses for BL Lac objects, ranging from a few\ntens of millions to a billion solar masses, similar to\nthe black hole mass ranges of normal (Kormendy\n& Gebhardt 2001) and radio galaxies (Woo & Urry\n2002). It seems that regardless of the strength of\nthe AGN activity, black hole mass spans a similar\nrange, although the upper and lower limits of the\nblack hole mass are not constrained.\nThe spectral energy distributions of BL Lac objects show two distinct peaks, at low and high frequencies, due to synchrotron and inverse Compton\nemission from the unresolved nucleus. The peak\nfrequencies vary systematically and BL Lacs have\nbeen divided into two types, namely, low-energy\npeaked (LBL) and high-energy peaked (HBL). Using measured velocity dispersions, Barth et al.\n(2002) and Falomo et al. (2003) derived black\nhole masses using the M\u2022 -\u03c3 relation and found\nsimilar BH mass ranges between LBL and HBL,\nas predicted by Urry et al. (2000) on the basis\nof their similar host galaxy luminosities. With a\nlarger sample of BL Lac objects, we confirm that\nblack hole mass is independent of BL Lac type,\nsuggesting black hole mass does not control the\npeak frequency (Fig. 7).\n\nAGN BLACK HOLE MASS\n\n4.1.\n\nBlack Hole Mass of BL Lac Objects\nand Radio Galaxies\n\nAGN black hole masses estimated from reverberation mapping results show the same correlation with bulge kinematics as normal galaxies\n(Gebhardt et al. 2000b; Ferrarese et al. 2001).\nThis tight correlation between black hole mass and\nbulge dispersion plausibly holds up to the epoch\nwhen galaxies have formed and virialized (Shields\net al. 2003), after which the kinematical properties\nof each galaxy should be approximately stationary.\nTherefore, the mass-dispersion correlation is probably valid for galaxies that lie on the Fundamental\nPlane.\nOur sample of AGN host galaxies at z < 0.34\nshows the same Fundamental Plane as normal\nand radio galaxies, particularly at similar redshift\nrange common to all samples, as we shown in \u00a7 3.\nThus, we estimate the black hole mass of these\nobjects using the M\u2022 -\u03c3 relation of normal galaxies (Tremaine et al. 2002):\nM\u2022 = 1.349 \u00d7 108 M\u2299 (\u03c3e /200km s\u22121 )4.02 .\n\n4.2.\n\nBlack Hole Mass to Galaxy Luminosity Relation\n\nWe derived the black hole mass to host galaxy\nluminosity relation in the Cousins R band (Fig.\n8). For the 11 objects at z < 0.1, the best fit is:\n\nM\u2022 /M\u2299 = \u22120.51(\u00b10.11) \u00d7 MR \u2212 3.23(\u00b12.47) .\n(7)\nHere, MR is the rest-frame absolute R magnitude of the host galaxy, determined using the apparent magnitude, after correcting for foreground\nGalactic extinction and applying a K correction.\nHigher redshift objects are removed before fitting\nsince younger stellar populations can alter the local (z < 0.1) black hole mass \u2013 galaxy luminosity\nrelation. The derived slope of the mass \u2013 luminosity relation in the Cousins R band is -0.51, similar\nto -0.50 derived for local normal and radio galaxy\nsamples (McLure & Dunlop 2002; Bettoni et al.\n2003), indicating the local mass \u2013 luminosity relation is indistinguishable among normal, radio,\nand AGN host galaxies. The mass \u2013 luminosity\n\n(6)\n\nwith proper aperture corrections for \u03c3e , following\nJorgensen et al. (1995; which gives at most a 10\n% change in the velocity dipersion value).\n8\n\n\frelation derived from a sample of large redshift\nrange suffers intrinsic scatter because host galaxy\nluminosity evolves as a function of time while the\ngalaxy mass remains the same, probably up to the\nepoch of galaxy formation (see Fig. 4 of McLure\n& Dunlop 2002). Also, if derived from the local\nmass \u2013 luminosity relation, the black hole mass\nof high-redshift AGN will be overestimated due to\nthe younger stellar population.\nTherefore, we looked explicitly at the effect of\nluminosity evolution. We corrected all absolute\nR magnitudes to z = 0 using a stellar population synthesis model with zf orm = 2. We then\nderived the mass \u2013 luminosity relation for high(z > 0.1) and low-redshift (z < 0.1) galaxies. The\nslope between mass and luminosity for the highredshift sample is \u22120.45 \u00b1 0.12, lower than that of\nthe low redshift sample (\u22120.52 \u00b1 0.11) but consistent within the uncertainties. The values of\ny-intercept are also consistent within the uncertainties (\u22123.33 \u00b1 2.45 for the low-redshift sample;\n\u22122.03 \u00b1 2.73 for the high-redshift sample). The\nRMS scatter increases from 0.16 to 0.24 in logM\u2022 ,\nsuggesting the intrinsic scatter of the relation is\nlarger at high redshift. However, it might be simply due to the larger luminosity correction error\nfor younger galaxies at higher redshift.\n5.\n\ngalaxy evolution, also known as the Grand Unification hypothesis. More studies, including radioquiet AGNs and more AGNs at high redshift, are\nrequired to further verify this. However, measurements of bulge stellar velocity dispersion for host\ngalaxies with a bright nucleus are extremely difficult due to the presence of luminous AGN continuum. New techniques will be necessary to overcome this barrier.\nWe estimated black hole masses for the combined sample of AGN host galaxies using the M\u2022 \u03c3 correlation. The black hole mass distribution of\n23 BL Lac objects is similar to that of 72 local radio galaxies. We also confirm that black hole mass\nis independent of BL Lac object type, suggesting\nthe peak frequency of BL Lac SED is controlled\nby other parameters.\nThe correlation between black hole mass and\ngalaxy luminosity for a sub-sample of AGNs at\nz < 0.1 has a slope consistent with that of local\nradio and normal galaxies. The mass \u2013 luminosity\nrelation derived for larger redshift AGN is uncertain due to the luminosity evolution of the host\ngalaxies.\nThis research is a part of the AGN key project\nof the Yale-Calan collaboration, and has been supported by Fundacion Andes.

The mass-tolight ratio increases \u223c 40% since z \u223c 0.3, which is\nsimilar to that of normal early-type galaxies, and\nconsistent with single burst galaxy formation models with zf orm & 1, indicating AGN host galaxies\nformed at high redshift and evolved passively afterward. The fact that AGN host galaxies show\nthe same Fundamental Plane and mass-to-light\nratio evolution as normal galaxies indicates that\nthere is no fundamental difference between AGN\nhosts and normal early-type galaxies. Although\nBL Lac objects (and radio galaxies) do not represent all families of AGNs, this is yet another step\nto confirm AGN as a transient phase of normal\n\nREFERENCES\nAretxaga, I., Terlevich, E., Terlevich, R.

Top panel: Six galaxies with larger wavelength fitting range. Major\nstellar absorption lines, such as the G-band (4300\n\u00c5), H\u03b2 (4861 \u00c5), Mgb triplet (around 5172 \u00c5),\nand Ca+Fe (around 5269 \u00c5) are clearly visible in\nthe rest-frame galaxy spectra (thin line [colored\nblue in electronic edition]). The best-fit template\nspectrum broadened with a Gaussian velocity dispersion is over-plotted for each galaxy (thick line\n[colored red in electronic edition]). Bad pixels and\nAGN emission lines (especially H\u03b2 and [O III]\nlines) were masked out before fitting. The Mgb\ntriplet line is not well matched with the template\nspectra and therefore has been masked out (dotted\nline [colored green in electronic edition]). Bottom\npanel: Nine galaxies with smaller fitting ranges.\n\n12\n\n\fFig. 2.- Instrumental resolution of template\n(filled circles) and galaxy spectra (open circles)\nas a function of wavelength as obtained with the\nMagellan telescope. The resolution was determined as Gaussian dispersion measurements from\nHe-Ne-Ar Arc lamp lines for each instrumental\nsetup. The resolution in \u00c5 of the template spectrum is \u223c 10 \u2212 20% better due to the smaller slit\nwidth (0.7\u2032\u2032 ), so that the resolution of the galaxy\nand redshifted template spectra are very similar\nover the fitted spectral range.\n\nFig. 3.- The Fundamental Plane of AGN host\ngalaxies. Filled circles: BL Lac hosts and radio galaxies from spectroscopically observed sample. Open circles: BL Lac hosts from Barth et al.\n(2002) and Falomo et al. (2003). Small dots: radio galaxies from Bettoni et al. (2001). a) Edge-on\nview of the Fundamental Plane for 26 AGN hosts\nshowing a tight correlation among the three parameters with RMS scatter 0.103 in log re . The\ndashed line is the Fundamental Plane relation defined by Bettoni et al. (2001), who used a 72 low\nredshift (< z >\u223c 0.04) radio galaxy sample. The\nerror bars on the lower right represent typical errors for our observed sample. b) A different edgeon view of the Fundamental Plane.\n\n13\n\n\fFig. 4.- The Fundamental Plane of AGN host\nand normal Galaxies, separated by redshift interval, in two edge-on views. Squares: AGN hosts at\nz < 0.1; triangles: AGN hosts at 0.1 < z < 0.2;\ncircles: AGN hosts at 0.2 < z. Our sample of\n26 AGN host galaxies lie along the same Fundamental Plane (dashed line), defined with normal\nearly-type galaxies in the nearby Coma cluster\n(Jorgensen et al. 1996; small dots). The AGN\nhost galaxy Cousins R bands are transformed to\nGunn r, using r \u2212 R = 0.35. Host galaxies with\nhigher redshift in our sample lie below the fit due\nto the brighter luminosity, indicating a younger\nage of the stellar population. Correcting with a\npassive evolution model with zf orm = 2 changes\nthe points as indicated by the short lines. The error bars on the lower right represent typical errors\nfor our observed sample.\n\n14\n\n\fFig. 5.- Evolution of the mass-to-light ratio of\nAGN host galaxies. The evolution of M/L is consistent with single burst models with zf orm & 1.\nOpen circles: individual host galaxies; filled circles: averaged \u2206log(M/L) for each redshift bin\nwith 1 \u03c3 error bars; dashed line: stellar population\nsynthesis model with single burst at zf orm = 1;\nsolid line: a single burst model with zf orm = 2;\ndotted line: a single burst model with zf orm = 3;\nthin-solid line: an extended star formation model\nwith zf orm = 3 and \u03c4 = 2 Gyr, using Eq. (5). The\nobserved trend is similar to that of normal earlytype galaxies (Treu et al. 2002; van Dokkum &\nStanford 2003).\n\nFig. 6.- Mass-to-light ratio as a function of\ngalaxy mass, corrected for the M/L evolution using the zf orm = 2 model. Symbols are the same\nas in Fig. 4. Like normal early-type galaxies, the\n26 AGN host galaxies have a power law relation\nbetween M/L and galaxy mass. The dashed line\ncorresponds to the best fit to the data, with a slope\nof 0.38, similar to that of normal galaxies (Jorgensen et al. 1996). The error bars on the upper\nleft represent typical errors.\n\n15\n\n\fFig. 8.- Black hole mass to host galaxy luminosity relation in the Cousins R band. Symbols\nare the same as in Fig. 4. The local mass \u2013 luminosity relation is derived using 11 lower redshift (z < 0.1) objects (solid line). Higher redshift\nhost galaxies fall below this correlation due to the\nmass-to-light ratio evolution. High redshift AGN\nblack hole masses derived from the local mass \u2013\nluminosity relation will be overestimated because\nof the brighter host galaxy luminosity due to the\nyounger stellar population. The R band magnitudes corrected for luminosity evolution with a\nstellar population synthesis model with zf orm = 2\nare indicated by short lines. The mass \u2013 luminosity relation for higher redshift objects, corrected\nto z = 0, is shown with the dashed line. The\nslopes and y-intercepts of this relation for highand low-redshift objects are consistent within the\nuncertainties although the RMS scatter of higher\nredshift objects is larger. The error bars on the\nlower right represent typical errors. The error in\nblack hole mass is the propagated error from the\nmeasured stellar velocity dispersion.\n\nFig. 7.- Black hole mass distribution of BL Lac\nobjects (upper panel) and radio galaxies (lower\npanel). Black hole masses for 72 radio galaxies\nare from Woo & Urry (2002), which were derived\nusing the M\u2022 -\u03c3 relation (Eq. 6) and dispersion\nmeasurements of Bettoni et al. (2001). Black hole\nmasses for our sample are also estimated from the\nhost galaxy velocity dispersion using M\u2022 -\u03c3 relation. The black hole mass of our 23 BL Lac sample\nspans a similar range as radio galaxies. Black hole\nmass is independent of the BL Lac type, as shown\nby the single-hatched (cross-hatched) area representing the high-frequency-peaked (low-frequencypeaked) BL Lac objects.\n\n16\n\n\fTable 1\nJournal of observations\nRun\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\nDate\n\nTelescope\n\nInst.\n\n2/24,25/03\n4/28,29/03\n8/27/03\n9/15,16/03\n10/4,5/03\n\nMagellan 6.5m\nCTIO 4m\nCTIO 4m\nMagellan 6.5m\nKPNO 4m\n\nB&C\nRC\nRC\nB&C\nRC\n\nl/mm\n600\n527\n527\n600\n632\n\na\n\nslit\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1.2\n\nres.\n72\n66\n66\n72\n41\n\n\u00c5 pixel\u22121\n1.56\n1.2\n1.2\n1.56\n1.42\n\nscale\n0.25\n0.5\n0.5\n0.25\n0.69\n\nseeing\n\nsky\n\n0.7-0.9\n1.0-1.5\n0.8-1.0\n0.5-0.9\n1.2-1.5\n\nclear\nthin\nclear\nclear\nclear\n\nColumn (1) observing run, (2) observing date, (3) telescope, (4) instrument, (5) grating, (6) slit width in\narcsec, (7) instrumental resolution (Gaussian dispersion) in km sec\u22121 at 6000 \u00c5, (8) plate scale in \u00c5 pixel\u22121 ,\n(9) spatial scale in \u2032\u2032 pixel\u22121 , (10) seeing in arcsec, recorded from guiding cameras, (11) sky condition.\n\n17\n\n\fTable 2\nTargets and Measurements\nName\n\nz\n\n18\n\n1\n\n2\n\n0122+090\n0145+138\n0229+200\n0331-362\n0525+713\n0829+046\n1212+078\n1215+013a\n1215-033a\n1342-016a\n1514-241\n1853+671\n2143+070\n2254+074\n2356-309\n\n0.339\n0.124\n0.139\n0.308\n0.249\n0.180\n0.136\n0.118\n0.184\n0.167\n0.049\n0.212\n0.237\n0.190\n0.165\n\n< \u03bce >\n3\n18.97\n19.35\n19.30\n20.63\n19.36\n21.07\n19.89\n19.40\n20.27\n21.16\n18.66\n19.84\n20.06\n20.88\n19.63\n\nAR\n\nKR\n\nmR\n\n\u2206mR\n\nre\n\n\u2206re\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n0.25\n0.16\n0.36\n0.04\n0.32\n0.09\n0.06\n0.06\n0.10\n0.13\n0.37\n0.12\n0.20\n0.18\n0.04\n\n0.495\n0.154\n0.175\n0.431\n0.327\n0.231\n0.171\n0.146\n0.236\n0.213\n0.052\n0.274\n0.309\n0.244\n0.211\n\n18.88\n16.96\n15.85\n17.81\n17.49\n16.94\n16.02\n16.50\n17.10\n15.60\n14.45\n18.19\n17.89\n16.61\n17.21\n\n0.04\n0.03\n0.01\n0.02\n0.01\n0.04\n0.01\n0.01\n0.01\n0.02\n0.02\n0.02\n\n1.05\n1.75\n3.25\n3.10\n1.98\n4.30\n3.40\n1.67\n2.14\n6.29\n3.70\n1.50\n2.10\n4.90\n1.85\n\n0.10\n0.05\n0.07\n0.20\n0.01\n0.75\n0.10\n0.10\n0.08\n0.15\n0.35\n0.10\n\n\u03c3\nkm sec\u22121\n10\n\n\u2206\u03c3\nkm sec\u22121\n11\n\nRun\n\n240.\n155.\n267.\n249.\n279.\n250.\n283.\n221.\n166.\n248.\n242.\n146.\n232.\n300.\n206.\n\n22.\n21.\n17.\n20.\n28.\n37.\n6.\n13.\n13.\n9.\n7.\n31.\n19.\n18.\n16.\n\n4\n5\n5\n4\n5\n1\n1\n2\n2\n2\n1\n5\n4\n4\n4\n\n12\n\nExp.\nhour\n13\n1.7\n2.5\n3\n2.0\n3.5\n3.5\n1.5\n1.5\n3\n3\n1\n3\n1.5\n1.5\n1\n\na\n\nr\n\nS/N\n\nC\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n1.25\n4.8\n6.9\n2\n6.9\n2\n2.5\n2\n2.5\n3\n2.5\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\n52\n32\n49\n68\n25\n443\n133\n41\n43\n66\n302\n28\n103\n207\n151\n\n1.08\n1.11\n1.13\n1.10\n1.15\n1.09\n1.08\n1.07\n1.10\n1.10\n1.05\n1.09\n1.09\n1.09\n1.08\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\nColumn (1) name, (2) redshift, (3) averaged Cousins R band surface brightness within re , extinction and K corrected, using Equation\n(2), (4) Extinction correction from Schlegel et al.
