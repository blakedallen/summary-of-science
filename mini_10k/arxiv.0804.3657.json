Using these, we show explicitly that there are six conjugacy classes of\ncentralizers in the compact real form of G2 .\n\nAMS Subject Classification: 20G20, 17A75.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nLet G be an algebraic group defined over a field k. Let X be a G-space. Two elements\nx, y \u2208 X are said to have same orbit type if the isotropy subgroups Gx and Gy\nare conjugate. Let G be a compact Lie group acting on a compact manifold M. It\nwas conjectured by Montgomery (ref. [3], Problem 45) that there are only finitely\nmany orbit types. Floyd proved that if G is a torus group acting on a compact\norientable manifold then there are only a finite number of distinct isotropy subgroups\n(ref. [4], 4.5). Using the results of Floyd, Mostow ([9], Theorem) proved Montgomery's\nconjecture for a compact Lie group G acting on a compact manifold M. One can\nconsider the action of a group G on itself by conjugation and ask for the orbit types.\nThis case has been considered in [8] by R. Kulkarni where the orbit types are called\nz-classes. In [13] (Section 3.6 corollary 1 to Theorem 2) Steinberg proved that in a\nreductive algebraic group G (over algebraically closed field), with char G good, the\nnumber of conjugacy classes of centralizers of elements of G is finite. R. Gouraige\nstudied conjugacy classes of centralizers in Mn (D) (the algebra of endomorphisms of\na finite dimensional vector space over a central division algebra) in [5].\nIn this paper we consider the question of calculating conjugacy classes of centralizers of elements for anisotropic groups of type G2 over a field of characteristic\n6= 2, 3. Any group of type G2 over k is precisely the group of k-algebra automorphisms of some octonion algebra over k ([10], Chapter III, Proposition 5, Corollary).\n1\n\n\f2\n\nA. Singh\n\nAnisotropic groups of type G2 over k are given by automorphisms of octonion division algebras over k. We calculate centralizers of elements in G and their conjugacy\nclasses when G is of type G2 and anisotropic over k. We specifically calculate conjugacy classes of centralizers for compact G2 (anisotropic group G2 over R) and the\nnumber of conjugacy classes of centralizers in this case. In particular we show this\nnumber is finite (Theorem 4.2). We plan to continue the study of conjugacy classes\nof centralizers in other groups as well.\n\n2\n\nThe Group G2 and some of its Subgroups\n\nWe need description of some subgroups of the group G2 here. Most of these are\ndescribed in [11] section 3. Let k be a field and K be an algebraically closed field\ncontaining k. We assume that characteristic of k 6= 2, 3. Let C be an octonion algebra\nover k. Then the algebraic group G = Aut(CK ) where CK = C \u2297k K, is the split,\nconnected, simple algebraic group of type G2 . Moreover the automorphism group G is\ndefined over k. In fact ([10], Chapter III, Proposition 5, Corollary), any simple group\nof type G2 over a field k is isomorphic to the automorphism group of an octonion\nalgebra C over k. We abuse notation and continue to write the group G of type G2\ndefined over k as G = Aut(C) for some k-octonion algebra C.\nLet G = Aut(C) be an anisotropic group of type G2 , where C is an octonion\ndivision algebra over k. We fix some notation here. Let D be a composition subalgebra\nof C. We denote G(C/D) = {t \u2208 Aut(C) | t(x) = x \u2200x \u2208 D} and G(C, D) = {t \u2208\nAut(C) | t(x) \u2208 D \u2200x \u2208 D}, subgroups of G.\nLet D = L be a quadratic subalgebra. Jacobson described the subgroups G(C/L)\nin his paper (ref. [6]). We mention the description of this subgroup here. Let L = k(\u03b3),\nwhere \u03b3 2 = c.1 6= 0. Then L\u22a5 is a left L vector space via the octonion multiplication.\nAlso, h : L\u22a5 \u00d7 L\u22a5 \u2212\u2192 L defined by h(x, y) = N(x, y) + c\u22121 \u03b3N(\u03b3x, y) is a nondegenerate hermitian form on L\u22a5 over L. Any automorphism t of C fixing L pointwise\ninduces an L-linear map t|L\u22a5 : L\u22a5 \u2212\u2192 L\u22a5 . Then the group G(C/L) is isomorphic to\nthe unimodular unitary group SU(L\u22a5 , h) of the three dimensional space L\u22a5 over\nL relative to the hermitian form h, via the isomorphism, t 7\u2212\u2192 t|L\u22a5 . We choose\na, b \u2208 C with N(a)N(b) 6= 0 and use Cayley-Dickson doubling process to write C =\n(L \u2295 La) \u2295 (L \u2295 La)b. The nontrivial automorphism of L (denoted as \u03b1 7\u2192 \u1fb1) can\nbe lifted to an automorphism \u03c1 of C with \u03c12 = 1 where \u03c1(\u03b11 1 + \u03b12 a + \u03b13 b + \u03b14 ab) =\n\u1fb11 1 + \u1fb12 a+ \u1fb13 b+ \u1fb14 ab. Then (see [11], Proposition 3.5) G(C, L) \u223c\n= G(C/L) \u22caH where\nH = h\u03c1i.\nNow we describe subgroups G(C/D) and G(C, D) of Aut(C) when D = Q, a\nquaternion subalgebra. We denote the norm 1 elements of Q by SL1 (Q). Then we\n\n\fConjugacy Classes of centralizers in G2\n\n3\n\nhave, by Cayley-Dickson doubling, C = Q \u2295 Qa for some a \u2208 Q\u22a5 with N(a) 6= 0.\nLet \u03c6 \u2208 Aut(C) be such that \u03c6(x) = x for all x \u2208 Q. Then for z = x + ya \u2208 C,\nthere exist p \u2208 SL1 (Q) such that \u03c6(z) = x + (py)a (ref. [12], Proposition 2.2.1).\nWe denote such an element of G(C/Q) by Rp . In fact, we have G(C/Q) \u223c\n= SL1 (Q)\ne\nvia the map Rp 7\u2192 p. Now let \u03c8 be an automorphism of Q. Define \u03c8 \u2208 Aut(C) by\ne\n\u03c8(x+ya)\n= \u03c8(x)+\u03c8(y)a. Then one checks easily that \u03c8e is an automorphism of C that\nextends \u03c8 on Q. These automorphisms form a subgroup of Aut(C), which, we will\nabuse notation and, continue to denote by Aut(Q). We know that any automorphism\nof a central simple algebra is an inner conjugation by Skolem Noether theorem. For\nany c \u2208 Q\u2217 we have the automorphism Ic : Q \u2192 Q defined by x 7\u2192 cxc\u22121 . Hence\nAut(Q) \u223c\n= P GL1 (Q) \u223c\n= Q\u2217 /k \u2217 by Ic 7\u2192 c. We then have the subgroup G(C, Q) of\nautomorphisms of C leaving Q invariant, G(C, Q) \u223c\n= G(C/Q) \u22ca Aut(Q).\nSome of these subgroups are conjugate in the group G. We have Skolem-Noether\ntype theorem for composition algebras ([12], Corollary 1.7.3) which can be used to\ndescribe conjugacy of some of these subgroups.\nTheorem 2.1 (Skolem Noether type Theorem). Let C be a composition algebra and\nlet D and D\u2032 be subalgebras of the same dimension. Then, every isomorphism from\nD onto D\u2032 can be extended to an automorphism of C.\nWe use this theorem to get following,\nProposition 2.2. Let C be an octonion algebra over k and G = Aut(C). Let D and D\u2032\nbe two composition subalgebras of C. Suppose D and D\u2032 are isomorphic composition\nsubalgebras. Then the subgroups G(C/D) and G(C/D\u2032 ) are conjugate in the group G.\nAlso the subgroups G(C, D) and G(C, D\u2032 ) are conjugate in the group G.\nProof : Let \u03c6\u0303 be the isomorphism of D to D\u2032 . By Theorem 2.1 \u03c6\u0303 can be extended\nto an automorphism of C, say \u03c6. Then, it is easy to check \u03c6G(C/D)\u03c6\u22121 = G(C/D\u2032)\nand \u03c6G(C, D)\u03c6\u22121 = G(C, D\u2032 ).\nNext we calculate centralizers of elements in the group G and it turns out that\nthey are contained in one of the subgroups described above.\n\n3\n\nCentralizers in Anisotropic G2\n\nLet G be an anisotropic group of type G2 defined over a field k. Then there exists C,\nan octonion division algebra over k, such that G(k) \u223c\n= Aut(C). By abuse of notation\nwe write G = G(k) = Aut(C), k-points of G. We fix these notation for this section.\nWe want to calculate centralizer of a semisimple element in G. If k is perfect (e.g.,\nchar(k) = 0) every element in G is semisimple ([2], Corollary 8.5). Let t \u2208 G. We\n\n\f4\n\nA. Singh\n\ndenote the centralizer of t in G by ZG (t) = {g \u2208 G | gt = tg}. Since G is anisotropic\nevery element of G leaves a subalgebra of C fixed pointwise ([11], Lemma 6.1). We\ndenote the subalgebra of fixed points of t by Ct = {x \u2208 C | t(x) = x}. We note that\nt restricted to C0 , trace zero space of C, is an element of special orthogonal group of\nan odd dimensional space ([12], Proposition 2.2.2), hence t has a fixed point in C0\nby Cartan-Dieudonne theorem. This implies that the dimension of Ct is \u2265 2. As the\ndimension of a composition subalgebra can be 2, 4 or 8 the subalgebra Ct is either a\nquadratic field extension of k, a quaternion subalgebra or t = I. Hence we need to\ncalculate centralizers of elements which are contained in a subgroup G(C/L) where L\nis a quadratic field extension or G(C/Q) where Q is a quaternion subalgebra. However\nwe have,\nProposition 3.1. Let G be an anisotropic group of type G2 over k. Let C be the\noctonion division algebra over k such that G = Aut(C). Let t \u2208 G. Then Ct is a\ncomposition subalgebra of C and the centralizer ZG (t) \u2282 G(C, Ct ).\nProof : The subalgebra Ct \u2282 C is a composition subalgebra as C is division. Let\ng \u2208 ZG (t). Then,\nt(g(x)) = g(x), \u2200x \u2208 Ct .\nHence g(x) \u2208 Ct , \u2200x \u2208 Ct . This shows that g \u2208 G(C, Ct ) and ZG (t) \u2282 G(C, Ct ).\n\n3.1\n\nCt is a Quaternion Algebra\n\nLet Ct = Q be a quaternion subalgebra of the octonion division algebra C, hence Q\nitself is division.\nLemma 3.2. With notation as above, let t = Rp \u2208 G(C/Q) for some p \u2208 SL1 (Q)\nwith p 6\u2208 k. Then ZG (t) = {Rp1 Ic1 \u2208 G(C, Q) | p1 c1 \u2208 L} where L = k(p), a quadratic\nfield extension of k.\nProof : We write C = Q \u2295 Qb for some b \u2208 Q\u22a5 . Then t(x + yb) = x + (py)b. From\nProposition 3.1 we get, ZG (t) \u2282 G(C, Q) = {Rp1 Ic1 | p1 \u2208 SL1 (Q), c1 \u2208 Q\u2217 }. Let\ng \u2208 ZG (t) and let g = Rp1 Ic1 . Then\nIc1 = Rpp1 Ic1\ngt = tg \u21d2 Rp1 Ic1 Rp = Rp Rp1 Ic1 \u21d2 Rp1 c1 pc\u22121\n1\nand we get, p1 c1 p = pp1 c1 , i.e., p1 c1 \u2208 ZQ (p) = L where L = k(p) is a quadratic field\nextension of k. Hence ZG (t) = {Rp1 Ic1 | p1 c1 \u2208 L, c1 \u2208 Q\u2217 , p1 \u2208 SL1 (Q)}.\nNow we consider conjugacy classes of centralizers of these elements in G.\n\n\fConjugacy Classes of centralizers in G2\n\n5\n\nLemma 3.3. Let t, t\u2032 \u2208 G = Aut(C). Let t and t\u2032 leave quaternion subalgebra Q and\nQ\u2032 fixed pointwise, respectively. Suppose Q and Q\u2032 are isomorphic. Let t = Rp and\nt\u2032 = R\u2032p where p \u2208 SL1 (Q) and p\u2032 \u2208 SL1 (Q\u2032 ) and both p, p\u2032 6\u2208 k. Suppose L = k(p)\nand L\u2032 = k(p\u2032 ) are isomorphic field extensions of k. Then ZG (t) is conjugate to ZG (t\u2032 )\nin G.\nProof : As Q and Q\u2032 are isomorphic, by Theorem 2.1 we have an automorphism \u03c6\nof C such that \u03c6|Q is the given isomorphism of Q to Q\u2032 . By conjugating the element\nt\u2032 by \u03c6 we may assume t and t\u2032 both belong to G(C/Q). Let L and L\u2032 be isomorphic.\nThen there exists an isomorphism \u03c8 = Ic , conjugation by c \u2208 Q, which gives the\nisomorphism of L to L\u2032 . Let g \u2208 ZG (Rp ). From previous lemma g = Rp1 Ic1 with\np1 c1 \u2208 L. Then,\n\u03c8g\u03c8 \u22121 = Ic Rp1 Ic1 Ic\u22121 = Rcp1 c\u22121 Icc1 c\u22121 .\nWe note that cp1 c\u22121 cc1 c\u22121 = cp1 c1 c\u22121 \u2208 L\u2032 . This implies \u03c8g\u03c8 \u22121 \u2208 ZG (t\u2032 ) and hence\nZG (t) is conjugate to ZG (t\u2032 ) in G.\nWe note that the center of SL1 (Q) is {1, \u22121} and the element t in Aut(C) corresponding to \u22121 is a non-trivial involution (i.e. t2 = 1). By a similar calculation\nas above it is easy to see that ZG (t) = G(C, Q) for 1 6= t an involution. In fact any\nnon-trivial involution in Aut(C) correspond to a quaternion subalgebra in this fashion. Two involutions are conjugate if and only if the corresponding fixed quaternion\nsubalgebras are isomorphic ([11], Section 4). From Proposition 2.2, two involutions\nhave their centralizers conjugate if and only if the corresponding fixed quaternion\nsubalgebras are isomorphic. We observe that the centralizers corresponding to involutions and other type of elements in Lemma 3.3 are not isomorphic hence they can\nnot be conjugate in the group G.\n\n3.2\n\nCt is a Quadratic Field Extension\n\nNow suppose Ct = L, a quadratic field extension of k and t \u2208 G(C/L). We denote the\nnon-trivial automorphism of L by \u03b1 7\u2192 \u1fb1. Moreover we can find a, b \u2208 C such that\nQ = L\u2295La is a quaternion subalgebra and C = Q\u2295Qb. Then L\u22a5 is a hermitian space\nover L. With respect to the basis {a, b, c = ab} we write the subgroup SU(L\u22a5 , h) of G\nt\nas SU(H) = {A \u2208 SL(3, L) | AH\n\u0100 = H} where H = diag{h(a, a), h(b, b), h(ab, ab)}.\nWe denote the matrix of t as A with respect to this basis. We observe that t leaves a\nquaternion subalgebra fixed pointwise if and only if 1 is an eigenvalue of A, i.e., X \u2212 1\nis a factor of the characteristic polynomial \u03c7A (X). Since Ct = L, we may assume\nthat X \u2212 1 is not a factor of \u03c7A (X). We have,\nLemma 3.4. With notation as above, let t \u2208 G(C/L). Suppose 1 is not a root of\n\u03c7A (X). Then, ZG (t) \u2282 G(C/L).\n\n\f6\n\nA. Singh\n\nProof : Let t \u2208 G(C/L) be such that t does not fix any point in L\u22a5 . Let g \u2208 ZG (t)\nthen g \u2208 G(C, L) \u223c\n= SU(L\u22a5 , h) \u22ca h\u03c1i where \u03c1 is an extension of conjugation on L\n([11], Proposition 3.5). We denote the matrix of t in SU(H) by A. Then, either\ng \u2208 SU(L\u22a5 , h) or g = h\u03c1 for some h \u2208 SU(L\u22a5 , h). Suppose g = h\u03c1. We denote the\nmatrix of h by B and we denote the action of \u03c1 on elements of L by \u03b1 7\u2192 \u1fb1. We\nclaim that in this case there is no such element in ZG (t). We have,\ngt(\u03b11 a + \u03b12 b + \u03b13 c) = h\u03c1t(\u03b11 a + \u03b12 b + \u03b13 c) = h\u03c1(\u03b11 Aa + \u03b12 Ab + \u03b13 Ac)\n= h(\u1fb11 \u0100a + \u1fb12 \u0100b + \u1fb13 \u0100c) = \u1fb11 B \u0100a + \u1fb12 B \u0100b + \u1fb13 B \u0100c\nand\ntg(\u03b11 a + \u03b12 b + \u03b13 c) = th\u03c1(\u03b11 a + \u03b12 b + \u03b13 c) = th(\u1fb11 a + \u1fb12 b + \u1fb13 c)\n= t(\u1fb11 Ba + \u1fb12 Bb + \u1fb13 Bc) = \u1fb11 ABa + \u1fb12 ABb + \u1fb13 ABc.\nAs g \u2208 ZG (t), above calculation implies AB = B \u0100 where B \u2208 SU(H). In this\ncase the characteristic polynomial \u03c7A (X) = X 3 \u2212 aX 2 + \u0101X \u2212 1 will have property\n\u03c7A (X) = \u03c7\u0100 (X) = \u03c7A (X) which implies a = \u0101. But \u03c7A (X) = X 3 \u2212 aX 2 + aX \u2212 1 =\n(X \u22121)(X 2 +(1\u2212a)X +1) is reducible and A has 1 as an eigenvalue. Which contradicts\nthe assumption that 1 is not a root of \u03c7A (X). Hence ZG (t) \u2282 G(C/L).\nLet t \u2208 G(C/L) and let A \u2208 SU(H) be the corresponding matrix. Moreover we\nassume that 1 is not a root of \u03c7A (X). Suppose t is semisimple, we have the following\ncases:\n1. (a) The characteristic polynomial of A is irreducible over L.\n(b) The characteristic polynomial has form (X \u2212 \u03b1)f (X) where f (X) is a\nquadratic irreducible over L.\n(c) The characteristic polynomial of A has distinct roots over L, i.e, \u03c7A (X) =\n(X \u2212 \u03b1)(X \u2212 \u03b2)(X \u2212 \u03b3).\n2. The characteristic polynomial of A has two distinct roots over L, i.e., \u03c7A (X) =\n(X \u2212 \u03b1)(X \u2212 \u03b2)2 and minimal polynomial is (X \u2212 \u03b1)(X \u2212 \u03b2) where \u1fb1 = \u03b1\u22121\nand \u03b2\u0304 = \u03b2 \u22121 .\n3. The characteristic polynomial of A is \u03c7A (X) = (X \u2212 \u03b1)3 and the minimal\npolynomial is (X \u2212 \u03b1) where \u1fb1 = \u03b1\u22121 .\nWe calculate centralizers in these cases. We observe that whenever H is a connected\nsubgroup of a connected algebraic group G and t \u2208 H such that ZG (t) \u2282 H then t\nis regular (or strongly regular) in G if and only if it is so in H. Hence t \u2208 G(C/L)\n\n\fConjugacy Classes of centralizers in G2\n\n7\n\nwith Ct = L is regular in G(C/L) if and only if it is regular in G (Lemma 3.4). This\nimplies that any element of G(C/L) (which does not have 1 as an eigenvalue) is a\nregular element of G in the case 1, i.e., the connected component of centralizers of\nsuch elements are maximal tori. In the case 3 the element is scalar A = \u03b1.Id and in\nthis case centralizer is whole of SU(H). We calculate the centralizer in case 2 below.\nLemma 3.5. Let t \u2208 G = Aut(C). With notations as above let t \u2208 G(C/L) and\nA be the corresponding element in SU(H). Suppose 1 is not an eigenvalue of A\nand \u03c7A (X) = (X \u2212 \u03b1)(X \u2212 \u03b2)2 and minimal polynomial is (X \u2212 \u03b1)(X \u2212 \u03b2) where\n\u1fb1 = \u03b1\u22121 and \u03b2\u0304 \u0013= \u03b2 \u22121 . Then the centralizer\n\u001a\u0012\n\u001b of t is isomorphic to a subgroup\n\u22121\ndet(S)\n0\n\u2208 SU(H) | S \u2208 U(W, h|W ) for some 2-dimensional nondegen0\nS\nerate L-subspace W of L\u22a5 .\nProof : We have \u03c7A (X) = (X \u2212 \u03b1)(X \u2212 \u03b2)2 where \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 L both not equal\nto 1 and the minimal polynomial is (X \u2212 \u03b1)(X \u2212 \u03b2). Then we can choose a basis of L\u22a5 consisting of eigenvectors v1 , v2 , v3 corresponding to eigenvalues \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b2 of\nt. We denote the subspace generated by v2 , v3 as W . The matrix of t is diagonal with respect to this basis, A = diag{\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b2}. As 1 is not a root of \u03c7A (X)\nthe centralizer ZG (t) \u223c\n= ZSU (H) (A) which is isomorphic to ZGL3 (L) (A) \u2229 SU(H) =\n\u001a\u0012\n\u0013\n\u001b\n\u22121\ndet(S)\n0\n| S \u2208 U(W, h|W ) .\n0\nS\n\n4\n\nConjugacy Classes of Centralizers in Compact\nG2\n\nLet G be the compact real group of type G2 . Then (ref. [1] Chapter V, Section\n24.6 Statement (ii) under (c)) G is R-points of an anisotropic group of type G2 . We\nconsider the unique anisotropic form of G2 over R. As there is a unique anisotropic\nPfister form over R of dimension 8, there is a unique octonion division algebra (up\nto isomorphism) C over R and G(R) \u223c\n= Aut(C). We calculate centralizers of elements\nand there conjugacy classes in this case. Let C be the octonion division algebra over\nR and we write, by abuse of notation, G = G(R) = Aut(C). Let t \u2208 G. Let L be\na quadratic field extension of R left fixed pointwise by t (which is isomorphic to C).\nt\n\u0100 = 1}. We also note that all\nThen t \u2208 SU(L\u22a5 , h) \u223c\n= SU(3) = {A \u2208 GL3 (C) | A\nquadratic field extensions of R contained in C are isomorphic hence all subgroups\nof type SU(L\u22a5 , h) are conjugate (Proposition 2.2) in G. We denote the non-trivial\nautomorphism of L (the complex conjugation in case of C) by \u03b1 7\u2192 \u1fb1. We note that\nevery element in this case, k = R, is semisimple in G. Also every element of SU(3)\n\n\f8\n\nA. Singh\n\ncan be diagonalized in SU(3). Hence any element A \u2208 SU(3) is of one of the following\ntypes:\n(a) The characteristic polynomial of A is \u03c7A (X) = (X \u2212 \u03b1)(X \u2212 \u03b2)(X \u2212 \u03b3) where\n\u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 are distinct.\n(b) The characteristic polynomial of A is \u03c7A (X) = (X \u2212\u03b1)(X \u2212\u03b2)2 and the minimal\npolynomial is (X \u2212 \u03b1)(X \u2212 \u03b2) where \u03b1\u1fb1 = 1 = \u03b2 \u03b2\u0304\n(c) The characteristic polynomial of A is \u03c7A (X) = (X \u2212 \u03b1)3 and the minimal\npolynomial is (X \u2212 \u03b1) where \u03b1\u1fb1 = 1.\nIf A has three distinct roots and none of them is 1 then by Lemma 3.4 the centralizer of t is contained in G(C/L). A simple calculation shows that the centralizer of A\nin SU(3) is a maximal torus. Since all maximal tori of G are conjugate (ref. [7], Chapter IV, Corollary 4.35) and they are contained in a subgroup isomorphic to SU(3),\nwe get that the element t is strongly regular (those elements of which centralizer is a\nmaximal torus) in G. Moreover the centralizers form one conjugacy class. If 1 is an\neigenvalue the centralizer may not be contained in G(C/L). In fact we have,\nLemma 4.1. With notation as above, let t \u2208 G(C/L) \u2282 G where L \u2282 C is a quadratic\nfield extension of R. In addition, we assume that the characteristic polynomial of t has\ndistinct roots. Then, ZG (t) \u2282 G(C/L) if and only if t does not leave any quaternion\nsubalgebra fixed pointwise. Moreover, if t leaves a quaternion algebra fixed pointwise\nwe have ZG (t) \u223c\n= ZG(C/L) (t) \u22ca Z/2Z.\nProof : If t \u2208 G(C/L) does not leave any quaternion subalgebra fixed pointwise then\nthe characteristic polynomial of t does not have 1 as a root. Hence from Lemma 3.4\nit follows that ZG (t) \u2282 G(C/L). Now suppose t \u2208 G(C/L) leaves a quaternion\nsubalgebra Q fixed pointwise. By using Theorem 2.1 we may assume Q contains L.\nAs t \u2208 G(C/L) \u223c\n= SU(3) the corresponding matrix A can be diagonalized in the\nsubgroup SU(3). We write the matrix of t as A = diag{1, \u03b1, \u1fb1} for some \u03b1 \u2208 L with\n\u03b1\u1fb1 = 1. Note that \u03b1 6= \u1fb1 else \u03b1 = \u00b11 and the roots are not distinct. We check\nthat \u03c1 \u2208 G(C, L) conjugates t to t\u22121 (note that \u0100 = A\u22121 ). We also find an element\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\u22121 0 0\nB \u2208 SU(3) such that AB = B \u0100. We take B = \uf8ed 0 0 1 \uf8f8 then one can check\n0 1 0\nthat B \u2208 SU(3) and AB = B \u0100. Combined together we get an element g = h\u03c1 such\nthat g \u2208 ZG (t) and g 2 = 1 where h \u2208 G(C/L) corresponds to the element B \u2208 SU(3).\nWe check that ZG (t) \u223c\n= ZG(C/L) (t) \u22ca hgi. It is also clear that ZG (t) is not contained\nin G(C/L).\n\n\fConjugacy Classes of centralizers in G2\n\n9\n\nIf t has 1 as an eigenvalue the centralizer ZG (t) \u223c\n= T \u22ca Z/2Z where T is a maximal\ntorus in G (which is always contained in a subgroup SU(3)).\nIn the second case with respect to the basis chosen as above A = diag{\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b2}.\nSuppose neither of \u03b1, \u03b2 is 1 then the centralizer is (ref. Lemma 3.5)\n\u0013\n\u001b\n\u001a\u0012\n\u22121\ndet(S)\n0\n| S \u2208 U(2) .\nZG (t) \u223c\n=\n= ZSU (3) (A) \u223c\n0\nS\nIf 1 is an eigenvalue we have A = diag{1, \u22121, \u22121}. In this case t is an involution and\nthe centralizer is contained in G(C, L). We note that \u03c1 also centralizes t and hence\nZG (t) \u223c\n= U(2) \u22ca Z/2Z.\n= ZG(C/L) (t) \u22ca h\u03c1i \u223c\nIn the third case if \u03b1 6= 1 centralizer is whole of SU(3).
