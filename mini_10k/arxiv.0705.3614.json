Let\nPk (t) be the characteristic series for Atkin's U operator as an endomorphism of p-adic\noverconvergent modular forms of tame level N and weight k. Motivated by conjectures\nof Gouv\u00eaa and Mazur, we strengthen a congruence in [W] between coefficients of Pk\nand Pk\u2032 for k\u2032 p-adically close to k. For p \u2212 1 | 12, N = 1, k = 0, we compute a\nmatrix for U whose entries are coefficients in the power series of a rational function\nof two variables. We apply this computation to show for p = 3 a parabola below the\nNewton polygon N0 of P0 , which coincides with N0 infinitely often. As a consequence,\nwe find a polygonal curve above N0 . This tightest bound on N0 yields the strongest\ncongruences between coefficients of P0 and Pk for k of large 3-adic valuation.\n\n1\n\nOverview and background\n\nLet p be a prime number, N be a positive integer relatively prime to p, and k be an\ninteger. Let B be a p-adic ring between Zp and Op , the ring of integers in Cp . Denote\nby Mk (N, B) the p-adic overconvergent modular forms of tame level N and weight k\nand by Sk (N, B) the subspace of overconvergent cusp forms.\nFor every weight k, Atkin's U operator is an endomorphism of Mk (N, B) stabilizing\nSk (N, B). Denote by U (k) the restriction of U to Mk (N, B) and by U(k) the restriction\nto Sk (N, B). These are compact operators, so the characteristic series\nPk (t) = det(1 \u2212 tU (k) ), Qk (t) = det(1 \u2212 tU(k) )\nexist.\nLet am (Pk ) be the coefficient of tm in Pk (t). As a function on a suitably defined\nspace of weights k, am (Pk ) is a rigid analytic function of k.\nWan[W], and Buzzard[B] construct N\u0302(m), which grows as O(m2 ) and depends on\np and N and not on k such that vp (am (Pk )) > N\u0302(m).\nGouv\u00eaa and Mazur[GM] note, in an earlier work, the existence of N\u0302(m) and show,\nfor prime p \u2265 5, integer l and positive integer n,\nvp (am (Pk ) \u2212 am (Pk+lpn (p\u22121) )) \u2265 n + 1.\n\n1\n\n(1)\n\n\fFollowing a remark in [Ka], the result in Equation (1) extends to p = 2, 3.\nIn section 2, we show\nvp (am (Pk ) \u2212 am (Pk+lpn (p\u22121) )) \u2265 N\u0302(m \u2212 2) + n + 1.\n\n(2)\n\nIn section 3, for each p = 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, N = 1, we construct a matrix M for U(0)\nwith respect to an explicit basis. We show, for Mij the entries of M ,\n\u221e X\n\u221e\nX\n\nMij xi y j\n\ni=1 j=1\n\nis the power series expansion of a rational function of two variables.\nIn section 4, we show for p = 3,\n!\n\nm\nvp (am (Q0 )) \u2265 3\n+ 2m,\n2\nwith equality if and only if there is positive integer j such that m = (3j \u2212 1)/2. The secant segments joining these vertices of the Newton polygon N\u20320 of Q0 form a polygonal\ncurve above N\u20320 . We find evidence in support of a conjecture in [G] on the distribution\nof slopes of classical modular forms.\n\n1.1\n\nMotivating conjectures\n\nThe zeros of Pk (t) are reciprocals of U (k) eigenvalues. For rational number \u03b1, let d(k, \u03b1)\ndenote the number of U (k) eigenvalues with p-adic valuation \u03b1.\nConjecture 1.1 (Gouv\u00eaa-Mazur) Let k, l be integers, n be a positive integer, and\n\u03b1 < n. Then d(k, \u03b1) = d(k + lpn (p \u2212 1), \u03b1).\nWan [W] uses Equation (1) and the construction of N\u0302(m) to compute a quadratic\nconcave up function fW an (n) such that the conclusion of Conjecture 1.1 holds for\n\u03b1 < fW an (n).\nThe stronger congruence in Equation (2) together with the method of [W] shows\nthere is quadratic f (n) with quadratic term smaller than that of fW an (n) such that\nthe conclusion of Conjecture 1.1 holds for \u03b1 < f (n)\nConjecture 1.2 (Gouv\u00eaa) Let Rk be the multiset of slopes with multiplicity of classical p-oldforms in Mk (N, Zp ). The probability that an element of Rk chosen with\np(k\u22121)\nuniform distribution is in the interval ( k\u22121\np+1 , p+1 ) diminishes to zero as k increases\nwithout bound.\n\n2\n\n\f1.2\n\nSpaces of overconvergent modular forms\n\nFor p \u2265 5, let Ep\u22121 be the level one Eisenstein series. Let Mk (N, B) be the classical\nweight k level N modular forms with coefficients in B.\nProposition 1.3 (Katz) For p \u2265 5 and any f \u2208 Mk (N, B), there are bj \u2208 Mk+j(p\u22121)(N, B)\nfor j \u2265 0 and r \u2208 Op of positive valuation such that\nf = b0 +\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nj\nr j bj /Ep\u22121\n,\n\n(3)\n\nj=1\n\nThere is a distinguished choice of bj after choosing r and direct sum decompositions\nMk+j(p\u22121) = Ep\u22121 * Mk+(j\u22121)(p\u22121) \u2295 Wk+j(p\u22121),\nsuch that bj \u2208 Wk+j(p\u22121) (N, B) for j > 0.\nSee [Ka], Propositions 2.6.1 and 2.8.1. The parameter r is the growth condition and\nvp (r) is bounded above by the given f .\nLet Mk (N, B, r) be the space of modular forms with growth condition r. The space\nS\nMk (N, B) is vp (r)>0 Mk (N, B, r).\nRemark 1.3.1 For p = 3, N > 2 and prime to 3, Theorem 1.7.1 of [Ka] shows there\nis a level N lift of the characteristic 3 Hasse invariant, so an analogous expansion\nresult holds. Proposition 2.8.2 of loc. cit. shows the expansion result for N = 2.\n\nProposition 1.4 Suppose p = 2 or 3 and N relatively prime to p. For any f \u2208\nMk (N, B) there are bj \u2208 Mk+4j (N, B) and r \u2208 Op of positive valuation such that\nf = b0 +\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nr 4j/(p\u22121) bj /E4j ,\n\nj=1\n\nThere is a distinguished choice of bj after choosing r and direct sum decompositions\nMk+4j = E4 * Mk+4(j\u22121) \u2295 Wk+4j (N, B),\nsuch that bj \u2208 Wk+4j (N, B) for j > 0.\nProof. We follow the remark at the end of Subsection 2.1 of loc. cit.. Let B be the\nfourth power of the Hasse invariant A for p = 2 and the square of A for p = 3. In\neither case, B is a weight 4 level 1 modular form defined over Fp . A version of Deligne's\ncongruence holds: B \u2261 E4 mod 24 and B \u2261 E4 mod 3.\nFor N > 2, and relatively prime to p, the functor \"isomorphism classes of elliptic\ncurves with level N structure\" is representable by a scheme which is smooth over Z[ N1 ]\nand the formation of modular forms commutes with base change to a ring in which p\nis topologically nilpotent. So we repeat the construction of p-adic modular forms for\np = 2, 3 and Katz expansions with powers of r 4/(p\u22121) E4\u22121 .\n\n3\n\n\fFor p = 2, 3 (and 5), and N = 1, Section 1.4 of [Se2] states weight zero forms have\nexpansions in powers of \u2206E4\u22123 where \u2206 is the weight 12 level 1 cusp form. Coleman[C2]\nshows\nEk * M0 (N, B) = Mk (N, B).\nMk (N, B) is a free B module, so Mk (N, B) = E4 *Mk\u22124 (N, B)\u2295 Wk (N, B) for some\nWk (N, B) \u2282 Mk (N, B).\n\u2737\nTheorem 1.5 (Coleman) Let k1 , k2 be weights.

For j, m > 0, v3 (Cj+m,j ) \u2265 n \u2212 v3 (m) and Cj,j+m = 0.\nFor odd m, including m = 3n\u22121 , v3 (Cj+m,j ) \u2265 21 .\nFor all i, v3 (Mij\u2032 \u2212 (M \u2032 C)ij ) \u2265 3i \u2212 1.\nFor i \u2264 s, v3 (Mij\u2032 \u2212 (M \u2032 C)ij ) > 3i \u2212 1, because\n(M \u2032 C)ij =\n\n3i\nX\n\n\u2032\nMik\nCkj ,\n\nk=j\n\n* 3n .\n\nand 3i \u2264 3s < 2\nIf N\u20320 (s) = N\u0302\u20320 (s) then N\u2032k (s) = N\u20320 (s).\n\n\u2737\n\nCorollary 4.2.1 Let l be an integer and n be a nonnegative integer. Let k = 2*3n+1 *l.\nFor integer i, 0 \u2264 i < n \u2212 1, there are exactly 3i overconvergent 3-adic modular\nforms of weight k with slope in [mi+1 + 1, mi+2 \u2212 2], and these have average slope\n3i+1 \u2212 1.\n\nProof. By Proposition 4.2, N\u2032k (mi ) = N\u20320 (mi ) and N\u2032k (mi+1 ) = N\u20320 (mi+1 ). There\nare 3i = mi+1 \u2212 mi slopes with multiplicity accounted for by the edges joining these\nvertices of the Newton polygon N\u2032k .

The Newton polygons N\u20320 and N\u2032k both have vertices (mi , N\u0302\u20320 (mi )) and\n(mi+1 , N\u0302\u20320 (mi+1 )).\nBy Corollary 4.1.1 and Theorem 2.5, v3 (am (Pk )) = v3 (am (P0 )) for every m between\nmi and mi+1 .\n\u2737\nAffirming a pattern noticed by Gouv\u00eaa[G],\nCorollary 4.2.3 Let k = 2 * 3n+1 .
