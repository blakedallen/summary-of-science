The SFH of the Galaxy (Milky Way) is worth studying, since\na large number of stars are observed individually and the SFH is inferred directly from the age\ndistribution of the stars. The SFH is closely related to the chemical evolution of the Galaxy. For\nexample, the age\u2013metallicity relation (e.g., Pagel 1997) of Galactic stars is generally believed to\noriginate from the chemical enrichment of the Galaxy as a result of star formation.\nEggen, Lynden-Bell, & Sandage (1962) have pioneered the modeling of the Galactic SFH and\nits chemical evolution. From the correlation between the ultraviolet excess and orbital eccentricity\nof stars, they have concluded that the Galaxy formed by collapse on a free-fall timescale from a\nsingle protogalactic cloud. An alternative picture of halo formation has been proposed by Searle\n& Zinn (1978). They have argued that the Galactic system formed from the capture of fragments\nsuch as dwarf galaxies over a longer timescale than that proposed by Eggen et al. In any case,\ndetermining the timescale of the infall of matter and the chemical enrichment is an important issue\nto resolve the formation history of the Galaxy.\nA number of papers have investigated the formation (e.g., Burkert, Truran, & Hensler 1992)\nand chemical evolution (e.g., Matteucci & Fran\u00e7ois 1989) of the Galaxy and other spiral galaxies\n(e.g., Lynden-Bell 1975; Sommer-Larsen 1996). Many models of the SFH of the Galaxy have treated\nthe formation of the Galactic disk through gas infall from the halo. This scenario (the so-called\ninfall model) can be consistent with the age\u2013metallicity relation of the disk stars (e.g., Twarog\n1980), if a reasonable SFH is used. Moreover, the infall model provides a physically reasonable way\nof solving the G-dwarf problem (e.g., Pagel 1997, p.236), contrary to the closed-box model which\ntends to overpredict the number of the low-metallicity stars.\nSince stars are formed from interstellar medium (ISM), one of the factors that determine the\nstar formation rate (SFR) is the gas content of galaxies. Indeed, the SFR and the gas density\nis closely related (Kennicutt 1998). The most commonly used relation is called the Schmidt law\n(Schmidt 1959). It assumes that SFR \u221d \u03c1n , where \u03c1 is the gas density and n = 1\u20132. As long as\nsuch a law is assumed and the infall of gas occurs continuously as a smooth function of time, the\npredicted SFH is also a smooth function of time.\nThough the \"classical\" (i.e., smooth) infall model is widely accepted, there are observational\ndata that suggest intermittent or oscillatory star formation activities in spiral galaxies. This means\nthat the SFH is not a smooth function of time. Kennicutt, Tamblyn, & Congdon (1994) have shown\nthat the ratio of present-to-past SFR in spiral sample has a significant scatter. More recently,\nTomita, Tomita & Sait\u014d (1996) have analyzed the far-infrared to B-band flux ratio fFIR /fB of\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n1681 spiral galaxies (see also Devereux & Hameed 1997). The indicator fFIR /fB represents the\nratio between the present SFR and the averaged SFR over the recent Gyr. They have shown\norder-of-magnitude spread of fFIR /fB and suggested a violent temporal variation of the SFR.\nThe intermittence of the SFH in the Galactic disk is recently suggested by Rocha-Pinto et\nal. (2000a, hereafter R00). They have provided the SFH of the Galaxy inferred from the stellar\nage of the solar neighborhood, using 552 late-type stars. The age of each star has been estimated\nfrom the chromospheric emission in the Ca ii H and K lines (Soderblom, Duncan, & Johnson 1991).\nAfter metallicity-dependent age correction, completeness correction, and scale-height correction2 ,\nthey have derived the age distribution of the stars. Then, after correcting for evolved stars, they\nhave derived the SFH. They have also asserted that their SFH derived from the stars in the solar\nneighborhood is representative of the SFH in the whole disk, since the diffusion timescale of stars is\nmuch shorter than the Galactic age. The discussion in this paper is based on Figure 2 of R00. Based\non their data, R00 have suggested that the star formation activity of the disk is intermittent or\nvariates violently. Their suggestion has been statistically confirmed by Takeuchi & Hirashita (2000,\nhereafter TH00), who have also shown that the typical timescale of the variation is 2 Gyr. We note\nthat Hernandez, Valls-Gabaud, & Gilmore (2000) have also found an oscillatory component of the\nSFH in the solar neighborhood.\nTheoretically, the intermittent or oscillatory SFH is easily reproduced if we treat the ISM as\na nonlinear open system (Ikeuchi 1988). Ikeuchi & Tomita (1983, hereafter IT83) have considered\nthe ISM composed of three phases (cold, warm, and hot) as suggested by McKee & Ostriker (1977)\nand modeled the time evolution of the fractional masses of the three components (see also Habe,\nIkeuchi, & Tanaka 1981). Since the mass exchange among the three components is a nonlinear\nprocess, the limit-cycle evolution of the fractional masses can emerge (see also Scalo & StruckMarcell 1986; Korchagin, Ryabstev, & Vorobyov 1994). The limit-cycle behavior is supported by\nKamaya & Takeuchi (1997), who have interpreted the various levels of the star formation activities\nin spiral galaxies shown observationally by Tomita et al. (1996) in the framework of the nonlinear\nopen system model. Their interpretation is based on the galaxy-wide limit-cycle behavior of the\nISM.\nAnother interesting topic is the chemical evolution in such a limit-cycle ISM. If the oscillatory\nSFH is considered, we may find an oscillation in a chemical enrichment process. For example, the\nage\u2013metallicity relation of the stars in the Galactic disk may scatter because of the oscillation. We\nwill examine quantitatively such a scatter caused by the limit-cycle evolution.\nIn this paper, we model the oscillatory SFH in the Galactic disk proposed by R00 by combining\nthe infall model and the limit-cycle model. The chemical evolution in the oscillatory SFH is also\ninvestigated. This paper is organized as follows. First, in \u00a7 2 we model the chemical evolution of\nthe Galactic disk by using the infall model. Then, in \u00a7 3 we review the limit-cycle model of ISM.\n2\n\nThe scale height is dependent on the age of stars.\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nSome results derived from the equations are described in \u00a7 4. Finally, we discuss the SFH and the\nchemical evolution in the limit-cycle ISM in \u00a7 5.\n\n2.\n\nCHEMICAL EVOLUTION MODEL\n\nThe chemical evolution model of the Galactic disk is constructed here. The model is based on\nthe infall model, which is characterized by the gradual gas infall from the halo. We adopt a onezone model for simplicity. In other words, the phenomena of the ISM are averaged in space. This\nsimple treatment is advantageous because the response of the chemical evolution on the parameters\nis easy to examine. When we compare the result with the observational data, however, we should\nbe careful whether the data are averaged or not. We comment on the one-zone approximation in\n\u00a7 3.4.\n\n2.1.\n\nGas and Metal\n\nThe changing rates of the gas mass (Mg ) and metal mass (Mi , where i denotes the species of\nthe metal; i = Fe, O, etc.) in the Galactic disk are described by a set of differential equations\ndMg\n= \u2212\u03c8 + E + F ,\n(1)\ndt\ndMi\n= \u2212Xi \u03c8 + Ei + F Xif ,\n(2)\ndt\nwhere \u03c8 is the SFR, E is the total injection rate of gas from stars, F is the rate of gas infall from\nhalo, Xi is the abundance of i (i.e., Xi \u2261 Mi /Mg ), Ei is the injection rate of element i from stars,\nand Xif is the abundance of i in the infall material (see e.g., Tinsley 1980 for the basic treatment\nof chemical evolution of galaxies). Introducing Xif enables us to treat the infall of pre-enriched gas.\nAn early enrichment in the halo may be important for the initial phase of the disk formation (e.g.,\nIkuta & Arimoto 1999).\nIn this paper, we choose two tracers for the metallicity, O and Fe. Almost all the oxygen is\nproduced by high-mass stars, while the iron is produced mainly by Type Ia supernovae (SNe) as well\nas by high-mass stars. Thus, we include the contribution from Type Ia SNe in our formulation. We\nadopt the combination of the instantaneous recycling approximation and the delayed production\napproximation as formulated by Pagel & Tautvai\u0161ien\u0117 (1995). The evolution of Fe abundance\nbased on a model of Type Ia SN has been considered in Kobayashi et al. (1998). With these\napproximations, E and Ei at t are expressed by using the SFR as a function of time, \u03c8(t):\nE = Rins \u03c8(t) + Rdel \u03c8(t \u2212 \u03c4 ) ,\n\nEi = [Rins Xi (t) + Yi, ins ]\u03c8(t) + [Rdel Xi (t \u2212 \u03c4 ) + Yi, del ]\u03c8(t \u2212 \u03c4 ) ,\n\n(3)\n(4)\n\nwhere R and Yi are the returned fraction of gas from stars and the fractional mass of the newly\nformed element i, respectively, and the subscripts \"ins\" and \"del\" denote the instantaneous recycling\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nand delayed production parts, respectively. The delay time \u03c4 is set to 1.3 Gyr, according to \u00a7 3 of\nPagel & Tautvai\u0161ien\u0117 (1995).\nWe assume that the disk begins to form at t = 0. Its age is assumed to be 15 Gyr. When\nt \u2212 \u03c4 < 0, all the functions whose arguments depend on (t \u2212 \u03c4 ) are set to zero; for example,\n\u03c8(t \u2212 \u03c4 ) = 0 when t < \u03c4 . The initial condition is summarized in \u00a7 3.5.\nWith the above expressions (eqs.

In other words, we consider that stars are\nformed from cold clouds on a gas consumption timescale of t\u2217 . The time evolution of Xcold will be\nmodeled based on IT83, which treated the ISM as a nonlinear open system, in \u00a7 3. Equation (12)\nis equivalent to\n\u03c8\u0303 = fg Xcold /t\u2217 .\n\n2.4.\n\n(13)\n\nChoice of the Parameters of the Chemical Evolution\n\nAccording to Pagel & Tautvai\u0161ien\u0117 (1995), we choose the fractional masses of newly formed\nelements (see eq. [4]) as follows: YO, ins /XO\u2299 = 0.70, YO, del /XO\u2299 = 0.0, YFe, ins /XFe\u2299 = 0.28, and\nYFe, del /XFe\u2299 = 0.42, where the subscript \u2299 indicates the solar value. They explained the observed\nmetallicity of Galactic stars along with an infall model. For the abundances in the inflow gas, we\nf /X\nf\nexamine two cases: one is the primordial case, (XFe\nFe\u2299 , XO /XO\u2299 ) = (0, 0); the other is the\nf /X\nf\n3\npre-enriched case, (XFe\nFe\u2299 , XO /XO\u2299 ) = (0.1, 0.25) . The parameter in the delayed production\napproximation, \u03c4 , is set as \u03c4 = 1.3 Gyr. The returned fractions of gas, Rins and Rdel , are determined\nas follows: Rins = 0.16, and Rdel = 0.13. The details about these values are described in Appendix\nA. We will determine t\u2217 and tin in \u00a7 3.2.\n3.\n\nLIMIT-CYCLE MODEL OF THE ISM\n\nWe model the oscillatory behavior of the Galactic SFH proposed by R00. IT83 have shown\nthat an oscillatory behavior of the fractional masses of three components (cold, warm, and hot)\nemerges if one considers the ISM to be a nonlinear open system. An introduction and details\nconcerning nonlinear open systems are found in Nicolis & Prigogine (1977). We adopt the model\nby IT83 to explain the oscillatory SFH by R00.\nAs long as the infall timescale (tin ) is much longer than the oscillatory timescale, the effect of\nthe infall on the limit-cycle evolution is not significant. Indeed, as shown in Table 1, for the present\n3\n\nThis means that [Fe/H] = \u22121 and [O/Fe] = 0.4 in the inflow material. We note [Fe/H] = log(XFe /XFe\u2299 ),\n[O/H] = log(XO /XO\u2299 ), and [O/Fe] = log(XO /XO\u2299 ) \u2212 log(XFe /XFe\u2299 ).\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\ncase the case where tin \u2265 9 Gyr, which is much longer than the period of oscillation proposed by\nR00 (\u223c 1 Gyr; see also Takeuchi & Hirashita 2000). Thus, we can apply the original model by\nIT83, which did not include the effect of infall.\nTable 1: Examined Parameters.\nModel tsf (Gyr) t\u2217 (Gyr) tin\nA\n6.0\n3.9\nB\n11\n7.2\nC\n15\n9.8\n\n(Gyr)\n23\n12\n9\n\n3.1.\n\nModel Equations\n\nWe review the model by IT83. This model is used to calculate the time evolution of the mass\nfraction of the three ISM phases (see also \u00a7 1). The result is used to calculate the SFR through\nequation (13).\nThe ISM is assumed to consist of three components (McKee & Ostriker 1977); the hot rarefied\ngas (T \u223c 106 K, n \u223c 10\u22123 cm\u22123 ), the warm gas (T \u223c 104 K, n \u223c 10\u22121 cm\u22123 ), and cold clouds\n(T \u223c 102 K, n \u223c 10 cm\u22123 ). The fractional masses of the three components are Xhot , Xwarm , and\nXcold , respectively. A trivial relation holds:\nXhot + Xwarm + Xcold = 1 .\n\n(14)\n\nThe following three processes are considered (see IT83 and Ikeuchi 1988 for the details): [1] the\nsweeping of a warm gas into a cold component at the rate of aXwarm (a \u223c 5 \u00d7 10\u22128 yr\u22121 ); [2] the\n2 (b \u223c 10\u22127 \u201310\u22128 yr\u22121 );\nevaporation of cold clouds embedded in a hot gas at the rate of bXcold Xhot\n[3] the radiative cooling of a hot gas through collisions with a warm gas at the rate of cXwarm Xhot\n(c \u223c 10\u22126 \u201310\u22127 yr\u22121 ). Writing down the rate equations and using equation (14), we obtain\ndXcold\nd\u03c4\ndXhot\nd\u03c4\n\n2\n= \u2212BXcold Xhot\n+ A(1 \u2212 Xcold \u2212 Xhot ) ,\n\n(15)\n\n2\n,\n= \u2212Xhot (1 \u2212 Xcold \u2212 Xhot ) + BXcold Xhot\n\n(16)\n\nwhere \u03c4 \u2261 ct, A \u2261 a/c, and B \u2261 b/c.\nThe solutions of equations (15) and (16) are classified into the following three types, according\nto the values of A and B (IT83):\n1. A > 1; all the orbits in the (Xcold , Xhot )-plane reduce to the node (0, 1),\n2. A < 1 and B > Bcr ; all the orbits reduce to a stable focus [(1 \u2212 A)/(AB + 1), A],\n3. A < 1 and B < Bcr ; all the orbits converge on a limit-cycle orbit,\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nwhere Bcr \u2261 (1 \u2212 2A)/A2 . Apparently, case 3 is important in the interpretation of the oscillatory\nSFH shown in R00. Thus, we choose the parameters that satisfy case 3 as will be described in the\nnext subsection.\n\n3.2.\n\nChoice of Parameters of the Limit-Cycle Model\n\nSince the timescale of the variation of SFR derived by R00 is \u223c 1 Gyr (see also TH00), we first\ninvestigate whether the period of the limit-cycle can be the order of 1 Gyr. Indeed, a Gyr-timescale\ncycle is possible in the natural parameter range. According to Figure 3 of IT83, the period can be\n\u223c 102 /c when we choose A = 0.3 and A = 0.5. Since 1/c is of the order of \u223c 106 \u2013107 yr, 102 /c \u223c 1\nGyr is possible. Thus, we choose A = 0.3 or A = 0.5 and 1/c = 107 yr to demonstrate the Gyr-scale\noscillation of the Galactic SFH. The subsequent discussions are unchanged if we adopt another set\nof the parameters that satisfies the oscillation period of \u223c 1 Gyr.\nHere we confirm that the adopted parameters are within the reasonable range of the physical\nproperties of the ISM in the Galactic disk. First, Ikeuchi & Tomita (1983) estimated a from the SN\nrate and the maximum radius of an SN remnant (SNR) and obtained a \u2243 5 \u00d7 10\u22128 yr\u22121 . Next, we\nestimate b as the reciprocal of the evaporation timescale of a cold cloud. The evaporation timescale\nestimated in Hirashita (2000a) may be applicable in the present case and we obtain b \u2243 10\u22127 yr\u22121 .\nFinally, c is estimated from the collision rate of a cold cloud with SNRs. The collision rate tcol is\n2\nestimated as tcol \u2243 (\u03c0RSNR\nnSNR v)\u22121 , where RSNR is the typical size of a SNR, nSNR is the number\ndensity of SNRs in the interstellar space, and v is the typical relative velocity between a SNR and\na cloud. If we put RSNR = 50 pc, nSNR = 10\u22126 pc\u22123 ,4 and v = 100 km s\u22121 , we obtain tcol \u2243 107\n\u22127 yr\u22121 . A = 0.3 and B = 0.5 are easily satisfied if we assume\nyr. This means that c \u2243 t\u22121\ncol \u2243 10\nfor example a = 6 \u00d7 10\u22128 yr, b = 10\u22127 yr, and c = 2 \u00d7 10\u22127 yr, all of which are consistent with the\nabove order-of-magnitude estimates.\nTH00 adopted a star formation law \u03c8\u0303 = fg /tsf and did not consider the effect of a multicomponent medium with phase changes. In order to use their choices of the parameter values A\nand 1/c we must relate their tsf (the timescale in the classical smooth infall model) to our t\u2217 (the\none in the oscillatory infall model). This is achieved by averaging the gas consumption rate defined\nas \u03c8\u0303/fg = Xcold /t\u2217 (eq. [12]) over the whole galactic age where the oscillatory part of the efficiency\nis smoothed out and becomes 1/tsf . In other words,\nh\u03c8\u0303/fg i = hXcold i/t\u2217 = 1/tsf ,\n\n(17)\n\nwhere h*i indicates the time average of the quantity over the Galactic history (0 < t < 15 Gyr).\nSince Xcold = 0.65 for (A, B) = (0.3, 0.5) (Appendix B), t\u2217 = 0.65tsf . Following TH00, we examine\n4\nThe values of RSNR and nSNR are estimated according to Ikeuchi & Tomita (1983). We assume that the typical\nlifetime of a SNR is 107 yr.\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nthe three sets of (tsf , tin ) as summarized in Table 1. They determined the parameters by fitting\ntheir infall model to the observed SFH proposed by R00. All the three models provide an almost\nidentical SFH and reproduce the smoothed trend of the SFH (T00). Thus, it is meaningful to\nexamine all the three cases. However, Model A gives an infall timescale much larger than that in\ne.g., Matteucci & Fran\u00e7ois (1989), although they assumed the same time dependence of infall as\nthat in this paper. This long timescale indicates that the infall rate is almost constant over the\nhistory of the Galactic disk. We note that Model A predicts the highest metallicity of the three\nmodels (\u00a7 4).\n\n3.3.\n\nTreatment of the Delayed Production\n\nHere we should comment on the delayed production approximation. It assumes that all\nthe delayed production at t is determined by the SFR at t \u2212 \u03c4 . In reality, \u03c4 differs among\nType Ia SNe. Thus, the delayed production is determined by the averaged SFR around t \u2212 \u03c4 .\nExpecting that the lifetimes of Type Ia progenitors are comparable to, or longer than, 1 Gyr\n(\u223c the period of the SFR oscillation in the Galaxy) the averaged SFR around t \u2212 \u03c4 is described as\nMg (t \u2212 \u03c4 )hXcold i/t\u2217 = Mg (t \u2212 \u03c4 )/tsf , where Mg (t \u2212 \u03c4 ) is the gas mass at t \u2212 \u03c4 and equation (17) is\nused. Thus, we hereafter assume that\n\u03c8\u0303(t \u2212 \u03c4 ) =\n\n3.4.\n\nfg (t \u2212 \u03c4 )\n.\ntsf\n\n(18)\n\nComment on One-Zone Treatment\n\nFollowing IT83, the structure of a model galaxy is approximated by one zone. The simplicity\nof the one-zone approximation gives the advantage that the background physical processes are easy\nto see. In this subsection, we discuss the one-zone treatment.\nHabe et al. (1981) stated in their \u00a7 7 that for the one-zone assumption to be acceptable it\nis necessary that the mean distance between supernova remnants (SNRs) be less than 100 pc if a\ncharacteristic lifetime of SNRs of \u03c4life \u223c 107 yr and a mean expansion velocity of 10 km s\u22121 are\nadopted. This is because the SNRs should affect the whole disk for the one-zone treatment. A\ndistance of less than 100 pc means that there are N \u223c 104 SNRs in a galaxy disk, if the disk\nsize of 10 kpc is assumed. This number is reasonable if SNe occur every 103 yr (\u03c4life/N \u223c 107\n[yr]/104 ). Considering that the SN rate in a spiral galaxy is typically 1/100\u20131/50 yr\u22121 (Cappellaro\net al. 1993), the mean distance between SNRs is less than 100 pc even if 10\u201320 massive stars are\nclustered in a region.\nThe information of a place can travel over a distance of cs, eff tcyc in one period of the limit cycle,\nwhere cs, eff is the effective sound speed in the ISM and tcyc is the oscillatory period. Estimating\nthese quantities as cs, eff \u223c 10 km s\u22121 (a typical velocity dispersion in the interstellar space) and\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\ntcyc \u223c 1 Gyr, we obtain cs, eff tcyc = 10 kpc. Thus, the information of the limit-cycle behavior can\npropagate over the whole disk. Thus, the assumption of the limit-cycle behavior over the whole\ndisk may be good. In this paper, as a first step, we treat the model galaxy as being a one-zone\nobject. Here we should note that the gas transport in the radial direction is difficult if we consider\nthe angular momentum conservation. This difficulty may be a cause of the radial gradient of the\nmetallicity and the gas-to-star fraction in spiral galaxies.\nThe above discussions are not a satisfactory \"proof\" for the limit-cycle oscillation on the scale\nof the whole Galactic disk. (But it is important that it is not rejected.) At present, thus, the cyclic\nstar formation over the whole disk is an assumption that easily explains the variation of the star\nformation activity observed in the solar neighborhood by R00. We note that it also explains the\nvariety of the star formation activity of spiral galaxies (Kamaya & Takeuchi 1997). Hence, in this\npaper, we base our discussion on the limit-cycle behavior on a whole-disk scale.\nWhen we compare our result with the observational data, we should carefully consider to what\nextent the data is averaged. The range of Galactocentric radii that enter in the average depends\non the age. Considering that the diffusion of stellar orbits on a scale of 1 kpc occurs in 0.2 Gyr\n(Wielen 1977), it is reasonable to assume that the observational quantities are averaged on a scale\nof more than 1 kpc. Thus, as a first step, we adopt the one-zone treatment for the Galactic disk\nto see the chemical evolution in an oscillatory SFH. We should extend our model to multi-zone\ntreatment as Chiappini, Matteucci, & Gratton (1997) (see also Romano et al. 2000 for a recent\nwork) in the future. Observationally, the formalism in Meusinger (1991) may be useful in order to\nlink the global observed SFH with the SFH in different Galactocentric annuli.\n\n3.5.\n\nInitial Conditions\n\nThe initial condition is set as follows: XO (t = 0) = 0, XFe (t = 0) = 0, fg (t = 0) = 0,\nXcold (t = 0) = 0.1, and Xhot (t = 0) = 0.7. The convergence to the limit-cycle occurs on the\ntimescale of a few periods. The results are however not strongly dependent on the choice of the\ninitial conditions for Xcold and Xhot .\n\n4.\n\nRESULTS\n\nIn this section, the results calculated from the equations above are presented. They are compared with the observational data. Before displaying the results, we review the solving processes\nof the equations. First, the mass fraction of the cold gas, Xcold , is calculated by equations (15)\nand (16). Xcold is used to determine the SFR at t through equation (13). As for the delayed\ncontribution expressed in \u03c8\u0303(t \u2212 \u03c4 ), we take into account the scatter of the lifetimes of progenitors of\nType Ia SNe (\u00a7 3.3) and assume equation (18). The SFH and the chemical evolution are modeled\nby the infall model. The evolution of the gas mass normalized by the total available gas mass M0 is\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\ncalculated by equations (9). For tsf and tin , we examine three cases listed in Table 1. These three\ncases are also examined in TH00. The chemical evolution is calculated by equation (11).\n\n4.1.\n\nStar Formation History\n\nThe SFH calculated by our model is presented in Figure 1a. Since the three models predict\nalmost the same SFH as indicated by TH00, we present only the result of Model A in Table 1. We\nalso show the SFH observationally determined by R00 in Figure 1b in order to demonstrate the\nqualitative similarity between the model prediction and the observation.\n\nFig. 1.- (a) Simulated star formation history based on our model. The star formation rate (\u03c8)\nas a function of look-back time [(15 \u2212 t) Gyr] is normalized with the time-averaged value of \u03c8\n(h\u03c8i). Since the three models shown in Table 1 result in almost an identical star formation history,\nonly Model A is shown. (b) Star formation history derived observationally by Rocha-Pinto et al.\n(2000a).\n\n4.2.\n\nMetallicity Evolution\n\nWe test the model with the metallicity data of Galactic stars. Age\u2013metallicity relation, Gdwarf metallicity distribution, and [Fe/O]\u2013[Fe/H] relation are examined. First of all, we should note\nthat the yields may be uncertain because of the treatment of convection, nuclear reaction rates,\nmass loss in the asymptotic giant branch phase, etc. If the yields are systematically larger/smaller\nthan assumed in this paper, the metallicities predicted by our model should be systematically\nlarger/smaller. Thus, quantitative agreement by fine tuning of the parameters might be meaningless. However, the qualitative behavior of the metallicity evolution in the limit-cycle ISM is not\naltered even if the yield changes.\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\n4.2.1.\n\nAge\u2013metallicity relation\n\nThe age\u2013metallicity relation of stars in the Galactic disk provides us with information on its\nchemical enrichment history. Thus, our model is worth testing by using the age\u2013metallicity relation\nof the stars in the solar neighborhood. The sample is provided by Rocha-Pinto et al. (2000b), which\nused the same sample as R00.\nf /X\nFirst, we examine the case where the infall gas is of primordial abundance [i.e., (XFe\nFe\u2299 ,\nf\nXO /XO\u2299 ) = (0, 0)]. The age\u2013metallicity relation predicted by our model is shown in Figure 2a. The\nsolid, dotted, and dashed lines represent the results in Models A, B, and C, respectively. We also\npresent the observational data of the age\u2013metallicity relation by Rocha-Pinto et al. (2000b) (see their\nTable 3). Model A predicts the highest present metallicity, since its short gas consumption timescale\nleads to the most efficient chemical enrichment. Even in Model A, however, the discrepancy between\nthe model prediction and data is significant in the low-metallicity range. Rocha-Pinto et al. (2000b)\nnoted the high initial metallicity of the disk and attributed it to the pre-enrichment of the gas before\nthe formation of the first stars in the disk. They also have shown that the age\u2013metallicity relation\ndetermined from the chromospheric age can deviate upward (i.e., metallicity is overestimated) for\nlarger ages from the real relation because of the uncertainty in the age estimation. Thus, we\nf /X\nf\nalso examine the case where the infalling gas in enriched with metal [(XFe\nFe\u2299 , XO /XO\u2299 ) =\n(0.1, 0.25)]. The result is shown in Figure 2b. We see that the discrepancy between the model\nprediction and the observational data is reduced. From the viewpoint of modeling, the yield is also\nuncertain. Thus, we do not try any fine-tuning the age\u2013metallicity relation.\n\nFig. 2.- Age\u2013metallicity relation of the stars in the solar neighborhood. [Fe/H] is used as an\nindicator for the metallicity. The solid, dotted, and dashed lines represent the results in Models A,\nB, and C, respectively. The squares with error bars indicate the observational data point by Rochaf /X\nf\nPinto et al. (2000b). (a) Abundance in the infalling gas is assumed as (a) (XFe\nFe\u2299 , XO /XO\u2299 ) =\nf\nf\n(0, 0) and (b) (XFe /XFe\u2299 , XO /XO\u2299 ) = (0.1, 0.25).\nIn spite of such uncertainty, we can discuss the qualitative behavior of the age\u2013metallicity\nrelation. The amplitude of the oscillation of metallicity is smaller than the typical scatter of the\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nobserved data points (\u223c 0.3 dex). The small amplitude is natural, because metallicity is determined\nby all the past history of star formation, and thus the present oscillatory star formation does not\nsignificantly contribute to the metallicity.\nRocha-Pinto et al.'s data shown in Figure 2 seem to show a recent increase in [Fe/H]. The preenriched infall cannot solve this increase, since the infalling gas has too low a metallicity. However,\nwe should carefully examine whether the most recent data point in Figure 2 represents the SFH of\nthe whole Galactic disk, because if the recent chemical enrichment rate in the solar neighborhood is\nsignificantly higher than that in the whole Galaxy, the most recent data point would naturally show\na systematically higher metallicity. Moreover, data sets shown by other authors do not necessarily\nshow such an increase in the recent metallicity (e.g., Twarog 1980). It is necessary to analyze the\nobservational data further before we construct a theoretical model for the recent [15 \u2212 t . 1 (Gyr)]\nincrease in metallicity.\nWe can expect that the oscillation behavior is more prominent for oxygen than for iron, because\nall the oxygen is produced from the \"instantaneous\" part (i.e., YO, ins \u226b YO, del ). We present the\nf /X\nf\nresult for the case of pre-enriched infall [i.e., (XFe\nFe\u2299 , XO /XO\u2299 ) = (0.1, 0.25)] in Figure 3.\nIndeed, the amplitude of the oscillation is larger than Figure 2b. However, the oscillation would\nnot explain the scatter of the oxygen abundance of the stars in the Galactic disk.\n\nFig. 3.- Age\u2013metallicity relation of the stars in the solar neighborhood. [O/H] is used as an\nindicator for the metallicity. The solid, dotted, and dashed lines represent the results in Models A,\nf /X\nf\nB, and C, respectively. For the initial enrichment, (XFe\nFe\u2299 , XO /XO\u2299 ) = (0.1, 0.25) is assumed.\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\n4.2.2.\n\nMetallicity distribution\n\nThe G-dwarf metallicity distribution is also tested along with our model, since the primary\nmotivation for the infall model is to solve the G-dwarf problem (e.g., Pagel 1997). The probability\ndistribution function P (log Xi ) of the metallicity is calculated from our model as\nP (log Xi ) d log Xi = C \u03c8\u0303 dt ,\nwhere the constant C is the normalization so that\nZ 15 Gyr\nC\n\u03c8\u0303 dt = 1.\n\n(19)\n\n(20)\n\n0\n\nFrom equation (19), we obtain the following analytical expression for P :\n\u0012\n\u0013\ndXi \u22121\nP (log Xi ) = C(ln 10) \u03c8\u0303(t)Xi (t)\n,\ndt\n\n(21)\n\nwhere dXi /dt is calculated from equation (11). In comparing the distribution function with the\nobservational data, we should take into account the scatter of the data. Here, we simply convolve\nP with a Gaussian kernel as\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ \u221e\n(log XO \u2212 u)2\n1\nexp \u2212\ndu ,\n(22)\nP (u) \u221a\nPconv (log XO ) \u2261\n2\u03c3 2\n2\u03c0 \u03c3\n\u2212\u221e\nwhere we adopt \u03c3 = 0.1 to compare with Rocha-Pinto & Maciel (1996). We adopt these data\nbecause we would like to use a sample of G-dwarfs, whose lifetimes are comparable to the age of\nthe universe. In Figure 4, we show Pconv as a function of [Fe/H]. The solid, dotted, and dashed lines\nrepresent the result in Models A, B, and C, respectively. The histogram shows the data by Rochaf /X\nf\nPinto & Maciel (1996). The two figures (a) and (b) correspond to (XFe\nFe\u2299 , XO /XO\u2299 ) = (0, 0)\nf /X\nf\nand (XFe\nFe\u2299 , XO /XO\u2299 ) = (0.1, 0.25), respectively (same as Fig. 2a and b, respectively). We\nsee that Model A in Figure 4b seems to be the best of all the models. However, considering the\nuncertainty in the yields, we do not try any fine tuning. The excess of the observed number of\nstars around [Fe/H] \u223c 0.0 is consistent with the data by Rocha-Pinto et al. (2000b). As stated in\n\u00a7 4.2.1, this may be due to the recent significant enrichment in the solar neighborhood.\n4.2.3.\n\nEvolution of [Fe/O]\n\nIn order to test the effect of the limit-cycle behavior on the [Fe/O] ratio, we examine the relation\nbetween [Fe/O] and [Fe/H]. Since the oxygen is mainly produced by stars with short lifetimes, the\neffect of the limit-cycle ISM is reflected by the time evolution of the oxygen abundance. On the other\nhand, the iron is also produced by stars with long lifetimes and the information of the oscillation of\nISM phase is lost in the iron abundance. Thus, we expect that [Fe/O] oscillates as the limit-cycle\nevolution of ISM.\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nIn Figure 5, we show [Fe/O]\u2013[Fe/H] relation. The solid, dotted, and dashed lines represent the results in Models A, B, and C, respectively. The two figures (a) and (b) correspond\nf /X\nf\nf\nf\nto (XFe\nFe\u2299 , XO /XO\u2299 ) = (0, 0) and (XFe /XFe\u2299 , XO /XO\u2299 ) = (0.1, 0.25), respectively (same as\nFig. 2a and b, respectively). Indeed, we see that [Fe/O] oscillates. However, the amplitude of the\noscillation is not large. This is consistent with the age\u2013metallicity relation (Fig. 2). As mentioned\nin \u00a7 4.2.1, the amount of metallicity reflects the past-integrated SFR; thus, as long as the mass\nof newly formed stars is not dominated in the total stellar mass, the present oscillation has little\ninfluence on the metallicity evolution.\n\n5.\n\nDISCUSSIONS\n\nIn this paper, we have modeled the oscillatory SFH proposed observationally by R00. Our\nmodel is a combination of an infall model developed in the field of chemical evolution and the\nlimit-cycle model proposed by Ikeuchi (1988) and his collaborators. We discuss our result in the\nfollowing two subsections.\n\n5.1.\n\nLimit-Cycle Star Formation History\n\nThe oscillatory behavior of the Galactic SFH proposed by R00 is modeled by using the limitcycle model of SFH. The limit-cycle behavior of the three-phase ISM is suggested by Ikeuchi (1988)\nand his collaborators. Since the period of a limit-cycle orbit can be \u223c 1 Gyr within the framework\nof Ikeuchi (1988), the Galactic SFH is explained by the limit-cycle model of the ISM.\nRecently, Hirashita & Kamaya (2000) have explained the observed scatter of star formation\nactivity of a sample of spiral galaxies by using the limit-cycle model. They provided a consistent\nmodeling that explains the variation in the scatter of star formation activity among the morphological types (Sa\u2013Sc) as shown in Kennicutt et al. (1994). Since the Galaxy is a spiral galaxy, an\noscillatory SFH is consistent with the variation of star formation activity seen in other spirals.\nKennicutt et al. (1994) have also presented the ratio of the present SFR to the past averaged\nSFR (indicated as b there). From Figure 2 of R00, we see that b (denoted as SFR/hSFRi in R00)\ncan be as large as 2\u20133 for the Galactic SFH. Since the morphological type of the Galaxy is Sbc (e.g.,\nBinney & Merrifield 1998, p. 171), b = 2\u20133 is within the range of the Sbc/Sc sample in Kennicutt\net al. (1994, their Fig. 6). This consistency implies that the oscillatory SFH may be a common\nnature for all the spiral galaxies.\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\n\nFig. 4.- Distribution of the G-dwarf metallicity. The histogram shows the data by Rocha-Pinto\n& Maciel (1996). The solid, dotted, and dashed lines represent the results in Models A, B, and C,\nrespectively. All the distributions are normalized to unity when they are integrated in the whole\nf /X\nf\nrange of [Fe/H]. (a) Abundance in the infalling gas is assumed as (a) (XFe\nFe\u2299 , XO /XO\u2299 ) = (0, 0)\nf\nf\nand (b) (XFe /XFe\u2299 , XO /XO\u2299 ) = (0.1, 0.25).\n\nFig. 5.- Change in [O/Fe] against [Fe/H]. The solid, dotted, and dashed lines represent the results\nin Models A, B, and C, respectively. The dot-dashed line represents the observational data as\nsummarized in Fig. 3 of Kobayashi et al. (1998). (a) Abundance in the infalling gas is assumed as\nf /X\nf\nf\nf\n(a) (XFe\nFe\u2299 , XO /XO\u2299 ) = (0, 0) and (b) (XFe /XFe\u2299 , XO /XO\u2299 ) = (0.1, 0.25).\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\n5.2.\n\nChemical Evolution in Limit-Cycle ISM\n\nThe chemical evolution of the Galaxy has been investigated in the framework of the limit-cycle\nISM model. We have found that the amplitude of the oscillatory behavior of the metallicity is\nsmaller than the observed scatter (Figs. 2 and 5). This indicates that the observed scatter is not\nattributed to the limit-cycle behavior. The scatter might be explained by chemical inhomogeneity\nin the Galactic disk.\nThe oscillatory behavior of the metallicity is not prominent because the metallicity reflects\nall the past SFH. The integrated contribution from all the past SFH smoothes out the oscillatory\nbehavior of SFR. Thus, from the viewpoint of chemical evolution we conclude that we cannot\ndistinguish between the \"smooth\" infall model without an oscillatory behavior and the oscillatory\ninfall model proposed in this paper.\nContrary to the metallicity, the dust-to-gas ratio can show a oscillatory behavior (Hirashita\n2000b). This is because the efficiency of the dust formation changes according to phase changes in\nthe gas. Moreover, dust is efficiently destroyed when the mass fraction of the cold gas is small. This\noscillation of dust amount may be important for the evolution of infrared luminosity of galaxies.\n\n5.3.\n\nAnother Possible Mechanism for the Variation of SFR\n\nRocha-Pinto et al. (2000c) gave some indication that the Magellanic Clouds could play a role\nin the SFH of the Galaxy. It is meaningful to explore their idea. Since our discussion is based on\nthe limit-cycle behavior inherent in the ISM as stated in \u00a7 1, we do not include the external force\ninto our formulation. Fortunately, Ikeuchi & Tomita (1983) have investigated the behavior of the\nISM in the presence of such an external force. Thus, we discuss the influence of the Magellanic\nClouds based on the discussion in Ikeuchi & Tomita (1983).\nIf a perturbation of the external force to the limit-cycle ISM exists, both the period and the\namplitude of the oscillation are affected. Thus, it is not necessary that the period proper to the\nISM is about 1 Gyr. Even in the stable-focus case (\u00a7 3.1), an oscillation emerges. Furthermore, the\nqualitative behavior can be changed: the system can show a chaotic orbit. Since the observational\ndata do not reject such a chaotic orbit affected by the perturbation of the Magellanic Clouds, the\nstrongly variable SFH of the Galaxy might be due to the interaction with the Magellanic Clouds.\nHowever, we note that the large scatter of the star formation activity of the spiral sample (e.g.,\nTomita et al. 1996) implies a general oscillatory behavior of ISM in spiral galaxies. This is naturally\nexplained if such an oscillatory behavior is caused by the limit-cycle evolution inherent in the ISM.\nFinally, we would like to note that Chiappini et al. (1997) have also considered SFR variation\ndue to a different mechanism. Their rapidly variable SFR is caused by a density threshold for star\nformation: They assumed that star formation occurs only if the surface density of the gas exceeds\na critical value, while we have assumed no threshold. However, the timescale of the SFR variation\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\nin Chiappini et al. is much shorter than 1 Gyr. Although Chiappini et al.'s mechanism may indeed\npresent on a timescale much shorter than 1 Gyr, it is necessary to introduce a mechanism different\nfrom Chiappini et al. in order to explain the SFR variability presented by R00. Thus, we have\nproposed a limit-cycle scenario for the SFR in the Galactic disk.\nWe thank H. Rocha-Pinto, the referee, for invaluable comments and suggestions that improved\nthis paper very much.

The dotted line represents\nthe time-averaged value of Xcold .\n\nA.\n\nA. DETERMINATION OF Rins AND Rdel\n\nRins and Rdel are described as\nRins =\nRdel =\n\nZ\n\nmu\n\n(m \u2212 wm ) \u03c6(m) dm ,\n\nm\nZ ml, l,insins\nml, del\n\n(m \u2212 wm ) \u03c6(m) dm ,\n\n(A1)\n(A2)\n\nwhere \u03c6(m) is the initial mass function (IMF), which is normalized so that the integral of m\u03c6(m)\nin the full range of the stellar mass (0.1\u2013100M\u2299 in this paper) becomes unity; mu is the upper\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\nmass cut-off of the stellar mass, and we here adopt mu = 100M\u2299 ; ml, ins and ml, del are set as 5M\u2299\nand 1M\u2299 , corresponding to the stellar lifetime of \u03c4 (the parameter for the delayed production) and\nthe age of galaxies. If we adopt the Salpeter's IMF (\u03c6(m) \u221d m\u22122.35 ), we obtain Rins = 0.16 and\nRdel = 0.13.\n\nB.\n\nB. DETERMINATION OF hXcold i\n\nThe cold gas mass fraction averaged over the Galactic lifetime, hXcold i, is used in \u00a7 3.2. It is\nestimated as follows. First, the time evolution of the cold gas is calculated based on the limit-cycle\nmodel in \u00a7 3 by adopting the parameters as A = 0.3, B = 0.5, and 1/c = 107 yr. The time evolution\nof Xcold is shown in Figure B1. Next, we estimate hXcold i by averaging Xcold (t) over the Galactic\nage (TG ) as\nhXcold i =\n\n1\nTG\n\nZ\n\nTG\n\nXcold (t) dt .\n\n(B1)\n\n0\n\nREFERENCES\nBinney, J., & Merrifield, M. 1998, Galactic Astronomy (Princeton: Princeton University Press)\nBurkert, A., Truran, J.
