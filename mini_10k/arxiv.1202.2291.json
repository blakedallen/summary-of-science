When joined\ninterfaces are subject to excessive loads, failure occurs.\nOften it is not the joints themselves that fail, but the\nmaterial that surrounds them, as the joints themselves\nare the stronger.\nThe aim of this work is, however, not to study failure\nof such joints with improvement of technology in mind.\nRather, we take the point of view that failure of a heterogeneous joined interface provides a simplified model\nfor fracture in bulk materials. Such an idea is not new.\nSchmittbuhl et al. [1] and Schmittbuhl and M\u00e5l\u00f8y [2]\nstudied, first computationally, then experimentally, the\nroughness of the fracture front moving through a sintered interface between two Plexiglas plates that are being plied apart in a mode-I fashion. The study of the fluctuations of this fracture front provides much insight into\nthe much more complex morphology of three-dimensional\nfracture surfaces [3].\nWe focus on the phenomenon of localization in this\nwork. Local failure occurs either because the material is\nweaker at that spot or because it is more loaded there\nthan elsewhere. Differences in local strength is due to\nheterogeneities. Differences in loading is due to structure in the stress field. If we assume that the interface is\nloaded uniformly - the local stress field will be quite uniform. Local failure will occur because of material weakness. For the simple reason that the further away we\nsearch from a point where a failure has occurred, the\nweaker the weakest spot we have found so far will be,\nlocalization is disfavored. Heterogeneity in strength induces a \"repulsion\" between the local failures. However,\n\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\u2021\n\narne.stormo@gmail.com\nknut.skogstrand.gjerden@gmail.com\nAlex.Hansen@ntnu.no\n\nwhen failed areas build up, local stress is concentrated\nat the rim of the failed areas making these regions liable to fail. Heterogeneity in the stress field induces an\n\"attraction\" between local failures.\nLocalization occurs when attraction wins over repulsion. A transition in the failure process occurs at this\npoint. What is the nature of this transition? As we shall\ndemonstrate, it is not a phase transition, but a crossover\nphenomenon.\nWhen localization sets in immediately in the breakdown process, it is normally expected that the system is\ninfinitely fragile in the limit of infinitely large system: As\nsoon as a single fiber breaks at a given load, the entire\nsystem breaks down at that load [4]. As we will demonstrate, this is not the case here.\nWe base our work on the discretized model for interfacial failure proposed by Batrouni et al. [5]. A square\narray of L \u00d7 L = N linearly elastic fibers placed a distance a apart connects a stiff half-space with a linearly\nelastic half space characterized by a Young modulus E\nand a Poisson ratio \u03bd (which we assume a typical value\nof 0.25 in the following). Each fiber, indexed by i, has an\nelastic constant k and fails irreversibly if it is elongated\nbeyond an individual threshold value ti . The threshold\nvalues are drawn from a uniform distribution on the unit\ninterval.\nThe separation of the two half spaces are controlled\nby displacing the hard medium by a distance D orthogonal to the interface where the fibers sit. Fiber i then\nexperiences a force\nfi = \u2212k(ui \u2212 D) ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere ui is the local displacement of the softer half space\nat the position of fiber i. The forces from the fibers are\ntransmitted through the softer elastic medium via the\nGreen function [6\u20138]\nX\nGij fi ,\n(2)\nui =\nj\n\n\f2\nwhere\nGij =\n\n1 \u2212 \u03bd2\n\u03c0Ea2\n\nZZ\n\na/2\n\n\u2212a/2\n\ndx\u2032 dy \u2032\n.\n|~ri (x, y) \u2212 ~rj (x\u2032 , y \u2032 )|\n\n(3)\n\n~ri \u2212 ~rj denotes the distance between fibers i and j at\npositions ~ri and ~rj respectively.\nThe Green function (3) is modified by the presence of\nboundaries due to the finite size (La) \u00d7 (La) = N a2 of\nthe interface. We assume periodic boundary conditions\nand take into account the first reflected images.\nWe note that if distances are measured in units of a, the\nGreen function (3) is proportional to (Ea)\u22121 . Likewise,\nfrom Eq. (1), we see that the elastic constant of the fibers,\nk must be proportional to a2 . Hence, if we change the\nlinear size of the system, (La) \u2192 \u03bb(La), while keeping\nthe discretization a fixed, we change only L \u2192 \u03bbL in\nthe model whereas we keep the parameters Ea and k\nfixed. On the other hand, if we change the discretization\na \u2192 a/\u03bb while leaving the size of the system fixed, we\nchange L \u2192 \u03bbL and the parameters (Ea) \u2192 (Ea)\u03bb and\nk \u2192 k/\u03bb2 .\nA given fiber breaks irreversibly (its elastic constant\nis set to zero) if stretched beyond a threshold value assigned from a spatially uncorrelated probability distribution. We choose the simplest: a uniform distribution.\nThe model is quasi-static, and in lieu of time, we measure the fraction of fibers that have broken, denoted\nby\nP\np. The load carried by the system is \u03c3(p) = i fi /N ,\nand when \u03c3 reaches its maximum, any extra load will\nresult in a complete catastrophic failure. We denote this\nthe critical load, \u03c3c , and the corresponding pc , the failure\npoint.\nIn the limit of (Ea/L) \u2192 \u221e, the model becomes identical to the equal load sharing fiber bundle model (ELS)\n[4, 9, 10]. On the other hand, for small values of (Ea/L),\nit does not approach any existing models. Models do exist, e.g. the local load sharing fiber bundle model (LLS)\n[11], where the nearest surviving fibers absorbs the entire load that a fiber was carrying when failing. Another\nmodel, introduced by Hidalgo et al. [12], distributes the\nadded load around a failed fiber as a power law in the\ndistance from the failed fiber. In both models, there is\nno elastic response by the planes defining the interface.\nWe have studied systems of size L = 256, L = 128,\nL = 64, L = 32 L = 16 and L = 8 with 10, 100, 1000,\n10000, 10000 and 10000 samples respectively. We explore\na range of elastic constants e \u2261 (Ea/L) in the range\nesoft \u2264 e \u2264 estiff where esoft = 2\u221217 = 7.63 \u00d7 10\u22126 and\nestiff = 26 = 32.\nIn order to visualize localization, we record the square\ndistance between consecutively failing fibers, \u2206r2 . If the\npositions of the failing are completely random, as is the\ncase in the ELS fiber\n\u221a bundle model, the average distance\nis h\u2206r2 i1/2 = L/ 6 \u2248 0.408L. We show in Fig. 1 a\nsuccession of histograms of (\u2206r2 )1/2 . That is, we\nrecord \u2206r2 (n) as a function of the number of failed\nfibers, n = pN - our \"time\" parameter. We then sum\nthe number of times \u2206r(n) has had a particular value\n\nFIG. 1. (Color online.) Histogram over the distance between\nconsecutively failing fibers, (\u2206r 2 (n))1/2 , as function of the\nnumber of failed fibers n = pN . Darker colors correspond to\nhigher density. The vertical bar indicates the failure point,\npc N . The curve shows the running average h\u2206r 2 (n)i1/2 . In\nall figures, L = 128. 100 simulations was used to construct the\nhistogram. From top to bottom, e = 32, e = 2\u22123.678 = 0.0781,\ne = 2\u22126 = 0.0156 and e = 2\u221217 = 7.63 * 10\u22126 .\n\n(\u2206r2 )1/2 at n for several independent simulations, hence\ncreating a histogram for each n. Darker colors signifies\nmore hits at that value of (\u2206r)1/2 . The curve shows the\naverage value h\u2206r2 (n)i1/2 . With L = 128, we see that\nfor the four different elastic constants e that we show,\ne = 32, e = 2\u22123.678 (this value is chosen to make the\nfigure comparable to the results in Batrouni et al. [5],\nwhere L = 128, E = 10, and a = 1, which gives e =\n0.0781 = 2\u22123.678 .) e = 2\u22126 and e = 2\u221217 , h\u2206r2 (n)i1/2\nstarts out being close to the ELF fiber bundle model value\n52.26.

The ELS fiber\nbundle model predicts pc = 1/2 so that nc = 8192.\nAs the system gets softer, both h\u2206r2 (n)i1/2 and nc\ndecrease. We see in three lower panels in Fig. 1 that\nthere is an abrupt change in h\u2206r2 (n)i1/2 for some range\nof n values. This is localization. We also see that the\nfailure point does not fall to zero as e is lowered. Even\nfor the smallest value in Fig. 1, e = esoft = 2\u221217 , nc is\nsignificantly different from zero.\nFig. 2 shows the failure point pc as a function of\nthe inverse of the logarithm of total number of fibers,\n1/ log10 (N ). From this figure, we may extrapolate the\nvalue of pc in the limit of infinitely large system. We find\n\u221e\npc (N \u2192 \u221e) = p\u221e\nc = 0.16 when e = esoft and pc = 0.5\nwhen e = estiff . Likewise, we may extrapolate the critical\nload \u03c3c - see the insert in the figure. We find through\nextrapolation that \u03c3c\u221e = 0.17 for e = esoft and \u03c3c\u221e = 0.25\nfor e = estiff , the value expected for the ELS fiber bundle\nmodel.\n\u221e\nIt is a surprising result that neither p\u221e\nc nor \u03c3c are zero\nfor small value of e. The LLS fiber bundle model predicts\nthat \u03c3c \u223c 1/ log10 (N ) with \u03c3c\u221e = 0 [13, 14]. Hidalgo et\nal. [12] present numerical evidence that their model also\nhas \u03c3c\u221e = 0. Hence, in both of these models, p\u221e\nc = 0.\nBatrouni et al. [5] studied the structure of the clusters\nof failed fibers at pc , claiming that at the failure point,\nthey are distributed according to a power law with exponent -1.6. This would indicate a critical point at p = pc .\nReferring to Fig. 1, we see that for e = estiff = 32, the\nsystem behaves as the ELS fiber bundle model where the\nposition of the fibers that fail bear no correlations among\nthemselves. It is clear when observing the average distance between consecutively failing fibers, h\u2206r(n)2 i1/2\nwhich essentially remains\u221aclose to the ELS fiber bundle,\nwhere h\u2206r2 (n)i1/2 = L/ 6. Hence, we expect that the\nclusters follow percolation theory [15]. In Fig. 3 we show\nthe density of of the largest cluster of failed fibers, s\u2217 , as\n\n\u22121.4\n\u22121.6\n\u22121.8\n\u22122.0\n\u22122.2\n0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0 2.2 2.4\n\nlog10[L]\nFIG. 4.\n(Color online.)\nFluctuations of pc , Wc =\np\nhp2c i \u2212 hpc i2 plotted against L for L = 8 to L = 256.

In the case of\nthe soft system, we see that at p \u2248 0.25, the largest cluster becomes visible and grows essentially linearly with p.\nThis behavior is due to localization. When p approaches\n1, there are jumps in s\u2217 , because of coalescence of clusters. On the other hand, when e = estiff , we see behavior consistent with percolation theory. When p is in the\nvicinity of p = 0.59274, the site percolation threshold on\nthe square lattice [16], s\u2217 shoots up and thereafter evolve\nlinearly in p.\nThe failure point at which the system fails catastrophically, pc , occurs long before the jump in s\u2217 for e = estiff .\nThis is an indication that the system is not critical at the\nfailure point. Schmittbuhl et al. [17] measured the fluctuations of the failure point as a function of the system\nsize, finding \u2206pc \u223c 1/L0.65. This is consistent with the\nGLS fiber bundle model.

From Fig. 4 we can see that the stiff system scales\nas L\u22122/3 , while the soft systems deviates. We conclude\nthat we cannot detect spatial correlation in the failure\nprocess beyond an uncorrelated percolation process for\ne = estiff .\nWe now proceed to study the onset of localization. Fig.\n5 shows the critical load \u03c3c as a function of e for systems\nof size L = 32 to L = 256. As e decreases, we observe that\n\u03c3c drops from the ELS fiber bundle value, goes through\na crossover and ends in a stable \u03c3c for each L in the soft\nregime.

The onset of localization is not a phase transition, but a crossover: there are\nno divergences anywhere in the derivative of this curve.\nThe following picture then emerges: For a given elastic constant, e, the breakdown process starts out as described by the ELS fiber bundle model. The spatial correlations between the failing fibers seems to be so weak\nthat it can be described as an uncorrelated percolation\nprocess. If the elastic constant e is large enough, the system will undergo both the ELS fiber bundle model failure\npoint and the percolation transition. Depending on the\nthreshold distribution, the ordering of the two events, the\nELS failure point and the percolation transition, may be\nreversed. With lower elastic constant, localization sets in\nand breaks off the ELS fiber bundle breakdown process.\nWhen localization sets in, all failure activity is then essentially limited to the rim of a growing cluster of failed\nfibers. The onset of localization is an instability, not a\nphase transition.\nWe thank M. Gr\u00f8va, S. Pradhan, S. Sinha and B.\nSkjetne for useful discussions.
