Within these regions, gas-rich proto-galaxies merge\ntogether rapidly, forming stars at a high rate. The same reservoir\nof gas used to build the stellar mass can also fuel the growth of\nthe supermassive black holes (SMBH) found dormant in the centre\nof the galaxies at low redshift (e.g. Kauffmann & Haehnelt 2000;\nPage et al. 2001; Hopkins et al. 2008). Since massive star formation is known to be a dusty phenomenon, the optical light from\nmany young galaxies should be highly obscured. Dust enshrouded\nstar formation is, however, a luminous phenomenon in the millime\u2217 E-mail:\n\nj.a.stevens@herts.ac.uk\n\ntre through far-infrared wavebands where the star-light absorbed\nby dust grains is re-emitted. Indeed, in the last decade, deep surveys at submillimetre (e.g. Smail, Ivison & Blain 1997; Hughes et\nal. 1998; Eales et al. 1999; Scott et al. 2002; Coppin et al. 2006)\nand millimetre (e.g. Greve et al. 2004; Bertoldi et al. 2007) wavelengths have identified a high-redshift population of massive, dusty\ngalaxies that are undergoing extreme starbursts (e.g. Smail et al.\n2002). Likewise, hotter dust heated in the circumnuclear environment of an AGN will emit at mid-infrared wavelengths. Therefore,\nsubmillimetre and mid-infrared observations can be combined to\nstudy activity in forming galaxies due to dust obscured starbursts\nand AGN.\nTo-date there has been no published survey at (sub)millimetre\nor far-infrared wavelengths of a randomly selected region of sky\nover an area sufficiently large to ensure that very rare structures in\nthe early universe are contained within it. Although large surveys of\n\n\f2\n\nJ. A. Stevens et al.\n\nthis type will be available soon from instruments such as SCUBA-2\non the JCMT and SPIRE/PACS on-board the Herschel Space Observatory, published surveys have so far been limited to an area of\n\u223c 0.5 deg\u22122 (Coppin et al. 2006; Austermann et al. 2010; Weiss\net al. 2009). One of the largest published submillimetre surveys is\nthe SCUBA HAlf-Degree Extragalactic Survey (SHADES; Mortier\net al. 2005; Coppin et al. 2006) which, due to technical problems,\nmapped only 0.2 deg2 discovering \u223c 100 submillimetre galaxies\n(SMGs). Whilst this survey provided one of the largest and most\nuniformly selected samples of SMGs ever assembled, the area of\nsky surveyed is extremely small by most standards. For example,\n\u039bCDM simulations predict that a dark matter halo of mass greater\nthan a few times 1014 M\u2299 at z = 2 will evolve to become a very\nrich cluster of galaxies by z = 0 (e.g. Farrah et al. 2006). However,\nsince the surface density of such massive haloes at z \u2265 2 is only\nof order 0.01 deg\u22122 (Evrard et al. 2002), a wide-area survey would\nbe required in order to contain one by chance.\nOne promising method of locating rare structures is to target the fields of high-redshift active galactic nuclei (AGN). Given\ntheir huge luminosities, such objects must contain a SMBH even\nat very high redshifts, and therefore must represent some of the\nmost massive objects in existence at their epochs. They should thus\nact as signposts to rare high-density regions of the early universe,\nand can be observed efficiently with existing technology. Several\ngroups have exploited this technique to search for proto-clusters\nforming around high-redshift radio galaxies (e.g. Kurk et al. 2000;\nPentericci et al. 2000; Ivison et al. 2000; Stevens et al. 2003; Smail\net al. 2003; De Breuck et al. 2004; Greve et al. 2007; Venemans et\nal. 2007) and quasi-stellar objects (QSOs; Stevens et al. 2004; Priddey, Ivison & Isaak 2008). Most of these studies have concentrated\non extreme objects, those with the highest luminosities and at the\nhighest redshifts, and all have found over-densities of star-forming\ngalaxies (typically Ly\u03b1 emitters or SMGs) in the fields of the AGN.\nHere we extend this work to investigate the environments of typical\nQSOs at submillimetre and mid-infrared wavelengths. The QSOs\nare selected over the redshift range 1.7 < z < 2.8 where the\nstar-formation rate density and accretion luminosity density of the\nuniverse peak. This work is motivated by the desire to study the\ncoupled formation of stellar mass and black holes in galaxies that\nshould evolve to become typical ellipticals in moderately rich clusters by the present day. Since the bulk of the field SMG population\nare also found at these redshifts (Chapman et al. 2003, 2005) we\ncan also compare the properties of galaxies found in different environments.\nThis paper presents submillimetre and mid-infrared imaging\ndata for 5 QSO fields. We extract submillimetre catalogues and integral number counts, and compare these with results from blank\nfield surveys. We then characterise the mid-infrared properties of\nthe QSOs and the SMGs discovered in their fields.\nA Hubble constant H0 = 70 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 and density parameters \u03a9\u039b = 0.7 and \u03a9m = 0.3 are assumed throughout.\n\n2 SAMPLE SELECTION\nOur targets are drawn from the sample of 28 hard X-ray selected\nQSOs described by Page, Mittaz & Carrera (2001). The objects\nhave X-ray spectra harder than the X-ray background, consistent\nwith moderate absorption (20.5 < log(NH /cm\u22122 ) < 23) and display broad optical emission lines. In previous work (Page et al.\n2001; Stevens et al. 2005) we have observed 20 of these objects using SCUBA in photometry mode. The remaining 8 objects were not\n\ntargetted with SCUBA due to observing constraints so this sample\nshould be representative of the population. Our sample for subsequent mapping comprises those QSOs with photometry mode detections of > 5 mJy/beam. This flux density threshold is based\non limitations imposed by current sensitivity limits and by confusion noise, but also means that any source detected at z > 1 must\nbe either an ultraluminous or hyperluminous far-infrared galaxy if\nthe emission is from dust, and if the temperature of this dust is\ntypical of such objects detected at low redshift. The observations\nof RX J094144.51 + 385434.8 were published by Stevens et al.\n(2004) but are included here for completeness. The 5 QSOs are\nlisted in Table 1 along with some basic parameters. They are selected to (1) span the redshift range 1.7 < z < 2.8 and (2) have\n0.5 \u2212 2 keV X-ray luminosities within \u223c 0.7 dex of L\u2217X , the break\nin the X-ray luminosity function.\n\n3 OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION\n3.1 SCUBA observations\nSCUBA jiggle-map observations at 450 and 850 \u03bcm were made\nat the JCMT between 2003 July and 2004 December. These observations are summarized in Table 2. We used a 64-point jiggle\npattern to fully sample the image plane at both wavelengths but employed a number of different chop/nod strategies. For RX J163308,\nRX J094144 and RX J121803 we chopped and nodded East-West\nwith throws of 30, 30 and 45 arcsecs respectively. For these objects\nthe off-positions fall at a fixed position on the sky; a real source\nthus has negative images of itself to the East and West, separated by\ntwice the chop throw but with half the amplitude. For RX J005734\nand RX J124913 we chopped and nodded in azimuth by 30 arcsec\nso the off-positions rotate with the field throughout the observation.\nEach mapping observation, taking typically one hour to complete, was bracketed by pointing observations on bright point-like\nobjects. Pointing offsets were in most cases < 2 arcsec and in all\ncases < 3 arcsec. Focus was checked throughout the night but particularly around sunset and sunrise when rapid changes are known\nto occur.\nAtmospheric transmission was determined with skydips and\nchecked against the JCMT water vapour radiometer. Maps of\nUranus, Mars and/or CRL618 were used for flux density calibration while maps of bright blazars were used to measure the beam\nprofile. At 850-\u03bcm the calibration was found to be stable enough\nto apply a single calibration to all observations; our combined flux\ncalibration factor (FCF) was 221 \u00b1 15 Jy/V/beam giving a calibration uncertainty of about 7 per cent. At 450-\u03bcm the FCF varies\nwith the atmospheric conditions because the filter profile contains a\nrelatively strong water line, but also depends quite strongly on the\nthermal state of the antenna (see Jenness et al. 2002). At 450 \u03bcm\nwe thus applied our best estimate of the FCF to each observation\nin turn; FCFs varied from 220 to 490 Jy/V/beam. The calibration\nuncertainty at 450 \u03bcm is \u223c 20 per cent.\nData were reduced with standard STARLINK SURF routines up\nto the rebinning stage (extinction correction, flat-fielding and despiking). For each mapping observation the individual bolometer\ntimestreams were inspected and noisy integrations/noisy bolometers were blanked. We then used adapted versions of the SURF tasks\nSETBOLWT and REBIN to make bolometer noise weighted mean\nsignal and noise maps on a 2 arcsec pixel scale (see Stevens et al.\n2004 for more details).

Frame times for the MIPS observations\nwere between 3 and 10 s. These observations are summarised in\nTable 3.\nThe IRAC frames were processed by the Spitzer Science Center using the standard pipeline version S14.0.0. The images were\nthen cropped to only include the region of constant exposure time;\nthis allows catalogues to be constructed from regions with similar noise properties. Source extraction was performed with SE X \u2032\u2032\nTRACTOR (Bertin & Arnouts 1996) with a fixed aperture of 3.5\nand a local background fit. Aperture corrections of 1.6 and 2.13\nwere applied to the 4.5 and 8.0 \u03bcm flux densities respectively, in\naccord with the values determined from the Spitzer First Look Survey (Lacy et al. 2005).\nFor MIPS observations, the 24 \u03bcm BCD images were fitted\nwith a plane after first masking out the bright objects. This plane\nwas then subtracted from each BCD frame resulting in a flat background image. These images were then combined with the IRAF\ntask IMCOMBINE using the astrometric solution from each individual BCD image. This procedure resulted in a much improved\n24 \u03bcm image, free of the jail-bar pattern common to the PBCD\nimages supplied from the Spitzer pipeline. Again, only the central\n3 \u00d7 3 arcmin2 region of the images was used to detect sources.\nWe used SE XTRACTOR to find sources and the PHOT script in IDL\nto measure their flux density within a 13 arcsec radius aperture. All\nflux densities were then subjected to an aperture correction of 1.167\n(see Seymour et al. 2007).\n\n4 THE SUBMILLIMETRE CATALOGUES\n\n(450 \u03bcm) giving final resolutions of 14.2 (850 \u03bcm) and 8.6 arcsecs\n(450 \u03bcm). The convolved maps with signal-to-noise (S/N) contours\nare shown in Fig. 1.\n\nOur philosophy is to match our analysis as closely as possible to\nthat performed by the SHADES consortium (Coppin et al. 2006)\nthus allowing a direct comparison of the number counts determined\nfor blank fields and those in the highly biased regions of the Universe surrounding our QSOs. Most of the analysis in this section\npertains to the 850 \u03bcm data. For the 450 \u03bcm data we extract a catalogue at a fixed S/N threshold but do not compute number counts.\n\n3.2 Spitzer observations\n\n4.1 Source extraction\n\nWe observed each field with the IRAC (at 4.5 and 8.0 \u03bcm) and\nMIPS (at 24 \u03bcm) cameras on-board the Spitzer Space Telescope.\nIRAC observations were made between 2005 March and 2005 July\nwhile the MIPS observations were made between 2005 March and\n2005 December. For the IRAC observations we used 5-pt Gaussian\n\nWe adopt the source extraction algorithm described by Scott et\nal. (2002) which performs a maximum-likelihood fit to the flux\ndensities of all potentially significant peaks identified on the convolved maps. For each source we took the convolved S/N map and\nsearched for all peaks with S/N> 1.5. A peak is found if a 10 \u00d7 10\n\n\f4\n\nJ. A. Stevens et al.\n\nTable 3.

In practice, this means that real sources separated by less than a beam width can be missed by the extraction\nalgorithm. This is the case for RX J094144 where we fail to recover two sources which are clearly real because we see them in the\nhigher resolution 450 \u03bcm data but are blended together at 850 \u03bcm.\nWe then took the unconvolved signal map and convolved it with\nappropriately scaled beam maps centred at these locations. The amplitudes of these beam maps were then adjusted until the overall \u03c72\nof the fit was minimised. For two sources with azimuth chop/nod\nschemes the beam was reconstructed by going back to the observing logs and calculating the position angle of the chop throw on\nthe sky at the mid-point of each observation. We then added these\ntogether, weighted by the integration time for each observation.\nThis method is suitable for extracting sources in fields where\nconfusion is likely to be a problem; it also has the advantage of using the off-positions to distinguish between real sources and noise\nspikes, and increases the S/N by considering the flux density in\nthe off-positions. The method was used for all four independent\nSHADES reductions although note that 'Reduction A' of Coppin et\nal. (2006) searched for peaks on the convolved signal maps rather\nthan the convolved S/N maps. We tried both methods but found that\npeaks towards the map edges were better recovered from the S/N\nmaps.\nUncertainties in submillimetre positions measured on SCUBA\nmaps have been discussed extensively by Ivison et al. (2007) who\nshow that the 1-\u03c3 error circle is given by 0.9 \u03b8A (SNR2 \u2212 3)\u22121/2\nwhere \u03b8A is the FWHM of the beam and SNR is the raw map signalto-noise ratio. A typical source with SNR\u223c 3 \u2212 4 at 850 \u03bcm would\nthus have a 1-\u03c3 positional accuracy of 3 \u2212 5 arcsec.\n4.2 Flux density deboosting\nA well known phenomenon common to all deep submillimetre surveys is that of flux density boosting. Real sources falling in regions\nof positive noise will have their intrinsic flux densities boosted,\nraising the likelihood of inclusion in the catalogue. This effect becomes increasingly significant as the intrinsic flux density of the\nsource approaches the limit of the survey. If not corrected for, flux\ndensity boosting will therefore populate the survey catalogue with\nan excess of low flux-density sources.\nWe use the Bayesian flux density deboosting recipe of Coppin\net al. (2005, 2006) which calculates a posterior flux density probability distribution for each source assuming a prior distribution of\nreal flux densities constructed from existing data. The prior is constructed using artificial skies which are sampled with the same observing technique used for the real data. Since we used two different chop/nod schemes we employ two priors; a two position chop\nscheme for the 3 fields observed with East-West chop throws and\nthe SHADES observing pattern for the two fields that were chopped\n\n2000\n3000\n2000\n5000\n1000\n\nMIPS 24 \u03bcm\nDate\nTint (s)\n20051202\n20050412\n20050519\n20050627\n20050306\n\n432\n336\n210\n636\n970\n\nin azimuth. SHADES employed a 6 position chop/nod scheme,\nchopping in both right ascension and declination with chop throws\nof 30, 44 and 68 arcsecs. We note that while this method is not a\ntrue match to an azimuth chop scheme, where the chop position\nangle rotates on the sky throughout the observation, it is nevertheless a better approximation than a two chop scheme. In any case,\nrunning the deboosting algorithm with either simulated observing\ntechnique resulted in the same catalogue give or take 1 or 2 sources\nclose to the selection threshold. Deboosted flux densities are listed\nin Table 4.\n\n4.3 Catalogue membership\nAs a first cut we took all sources found by the extraction algorithm\nwith a S/N> 2.0. This catalogue was then trimmed to include only\nthose sources which have less than 5 per cent of their posterior\nprobability distribution below 0 mJy. This cut is exactly that used\nby Coppin et al. (2006) for the SHADES catalogue. In Fig. 2 we\nplot extracted 850-\u03bcm S/N against extracted 850-\u03bcm flux density.\nThose sources falling above the solid line, and that remain there after deboosting, meet the above criterion and are included in the final\ncatalogue (Table 4). In the 5 fields we find 21 sources at 850 \u03bcm\nincluding 4 of the 5 QSOs. At 450 \u03bcm we simply list those sources\nextracted with S/N> 3 (Table 5) and do not attempt to deboost their\nflux densities. We assume that an 850 \u03bcm source is also detected\nat 450 \u03bcm if their extracted positions are within 10 arcsec. Using\nthis criterion we recover 8 of the sources detected at 850 \u03bcm including 3 of the QSOs. A further 6 sources detected at 450 \u03bcm are\nnot detected at 850 \u03bcm. Two of these objects lie in the RX J094144\nfield and were missed at 850 \u03bcm due to blending as discussed in\nSection 4.1. We note that the QSO RX J121803.82 + 470854.6 is\nnot formally detected at either 850 or 450 \u03bcm even though it was\ndetected by Page et al. (2001) using SCUBA in photometry mode.\nThis QSO is discussed further in Appendix A.\n\n4.4 Catalogue completeness\nExtensive simulations were performed to determine the completeness as a function of flux density. For each field we added false\nsources to the signal maps by scaling the normalised beam map to\nhave an amplitude of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16 and 18 mJy.\nWe then attempted to recover each source with the extraction algorithm and repeated this procedure 1000 times per field. We consider\na source detected if its recovered flux density is within a factor of\n2 of its input flux density, if its recovered position is within 7 arcsecs of its input position and if it makes it into our catalogue as\ndescribed in the previous section. These criteria are those adopted\nby the SHADES survey. We plot the fractional completeness for\neach field as a function of input flux density in Fig. 3. The fits to\n\n\fGalaxy formation around high-redshift QSOs\n\n5\n\nFigure 1. SCUBA maps of (a) RX J005734.87\u2212272827.4, (b) RX J094144.51+385434.8, (c) RX J121803.82+470854.6, (d) RX J124913.86\u2212055906.2\nand (e) RX J163308.57 + 570256.7 at 850 (left) and 450 \u03bcm (right). The grey-scales show flux density while the contours, which show signal-to-noise, are\ncalculated using the noise maps (see text). Contour levels are 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 \u03c3 except for RX J124913.86 \u2212 055906.2 where they are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10 and\n12 \u03c3. These contours refer to the significance levels on the pre-extracted maps as shown. Note that real sources will have higher significance when extracted\nwith the beam profile because emission in the off-positons is also factored into the total signal-to-noise.\n\n\f6\n\nJ. A. Stevens et al.\n\nFigure 1. - continued\n\nthe data have the form Completeness = (S a )/(b + cS a ) where\nS is the 850-\u03bcm flux density and a, b, c are free parameters. It is\napparent that the completeness is a function of both the average\nnoise level of the maps and the structure that they contain. We note\nthat the fractional completeness converges to \u223c 0.85 \u2212 0.9 rather\nthan 1 at high flux densities. This is due to the failure of the extraction algorithm to recover input sources which fall very close to the\nfield edges. The effect will be worse towards the top and bottom\ncentres of the fields where both off-positions fall outside the area\nused for extraction. We confirmed that this is the case by performing an 18 mJy simulation over the centre region of one of the maps.\nThis simulation returned a fractional completeness of 1.0. However, since real sources may also fall on the map edges in exactly\nthe same way that randomly generated false sources do, we do not\ncorrect for this edge effect. One other feature of these simulations\nworthy of remark is that the shape of the completeness curve appears to be sensitive to the adopted chopping scheme. Those fields\nobserved with an azimuthal chop/nod scheme have relatively high\ncompleteness at low flux densities, presumably due to an absence\nof the deep negative off-positions that are produced by chopping\nat a fixed position on the sky (most fields have a bright QSO at\ntheir centre), but they are relatively less complete at high flux den-\n\nsities where the absence of these off-positions becomes more of a\nhindrance.\n\n5 INTEGRAL NUMBER COUNTS\nNumber counts at 850 \u03bcm were calculated from the deboosted flux\ndensities after first making a correction for the completeness of the\ncatalogue for each field using the curves shown in Fig. 3. The total area of the survey is 28.4 arcmin2 . We follow Coppin et al.\n(2006) so that our counts are calculated in the same manner as\nthe SHADES counts. The method uses the deboosted flux density\nprobability distributions as input for a modified boot-strapping simulation which estimates the number counts and their errors. This\nmethod allows the flux density of an individual source to be shared\nappropriately between adjacent bins. We quote counts in bins of\nwidth 2 mJy (QSOs included; Table 6) and 1 mJy (QSOs removed;\nTable 7). These counts represent the mean value in each bin with\nthe quoted error being the frequentist 68% confidence interval in\neach flux bin based on boot-strapped Monte Carlo simulations, including Poisson counting errors.

Extracted 850 \u03bcm flux density against extracted 850 \u03bcm signalto-noise (uncorrected for flux density boosting). All sources extracted with\nS/N> 2 are plotted; those that fall above the solid line have > 95 per cent\nposterior probability that their flux density is > 0 mJy. These sources make\nit into our catalogue. Dotted lines show noise levels of 1 and 2 mJy/beam.\n\ngives the total number of submillimetre detected galaxies. This approach is also analogous to that adopted by previous workers on\nQSO over-densities (e.g. Priddey et al. 2008), although we stress\nthat the counts are only appropriate for X-ray absorbed QSOs that\nare pre-selected to be submillimetre luminous.\nQuoted number counts exclude the contribution from sources\n3, 4 and 5 in the RX J121803 field. All three have deboosted flux\ndensities close to 2 mJy where the completeness estimate from our\nsimulations is very low (< 1 per cent) and therefore subject to\na large uncertainty. The implication is that number counts in the\nlowest flux density bins will be underestimated. If we assume that\nthe true completeness of this field at 2 mJy is 5 per cent (a reasonable value from inspection of Fig. 3) and that the three sources\ncontribute entirely to the lowest flux density bin then the number\ncounts in this bin would increase by 70 per cent. However, no correction is applied to the quoted counts.\nThe counts (QSOs removed) are plotted in Fig. 4 which also\nshows number counts determined for the SHADES survey (Coppin et al. 2006). We note that counts determined at 870 \u03bcm from\na slightly larger survey conducted with the Large APEX Bolometer Camera (LABOCA) are consistent with those measured for\nSHADES at flux densities below 3 mJy and are about a factor\nof 2 below the SHADES counts at higher flux densities (Weiss et\nal. 2009). The dashed line is not a fit to the data but is simply\nthe best-fit Schechter function to the SHADES counts multiplied\nby 4. From this plot we can see that the observed over-density of\nsources around the QSOs arises almost entirely from galaxies with\ndeboosted flux densities in the range \u223c 2 \u2212 4 mJy. At higher flux\ndensities the counts in the QSO fields are matched very well to\nthose determined from SHADES data for the field.\n\nFlux density\n(mJy)\n\n850 \u03bcm integral counts, N (> S)\n(deg\u22122 )\nThis work\n\n2.0\n\n10420+3676\n\u22123584\n\n3.0\n\n3574+1129\n\u22121211\n\n4.0\n\n1423+524\n\u2212540\n\n5.0\n\n636+308\n\u2212300\n\n6.0\n\n343+205\n\u2212190\n\n7.0\n\n227+156\n\u2212167\n\n8.0\n\n175+146\n\u2212151\n\n9.0\n\n139+130\n\u2212131\n\n6 MID-INFRARED COUNTERPARTS\nLikely mid-infrared counterparts to the submillimetre galaxies are\ngiven in Table 8. For each field we searched within fixed radii of\nthe extracted submillimetre positions. These radii of 5 arcsec at 4.5\nand 8.0 \u03bcm, and 10 arcsec at 24 \u03bcm were chosen to approximately\nmatch the theoretical error circles on the submillimetre positions\nadded in quadrature with the uncertainty on the mid-infrared positions, which are significant at 24 \u03bcm (see Ivison et al. 2007 for a full\ndiscussion). The corrected P statistic (Downes et al. 1986) is given\nfor each source found within the search radii. This quantity is given\nby P = 1 \u2212 exp [\u2212P\u2217 {1 + ln (Pc /P\u2217 )}] where Pc = \u03c0rs2 NT ,\nP\u2217 = \u03c0r 2 N , rs is the search radius, NT is the surface density of\nobjects at the limiting flux density of the catalogue, N is the surface density of objects brighter than S where S is the flux density\nof a potential counterpart galaxy located a distance, r, away from\nthe submillimetre position.\nA value of P \u2264 0.05 is typically used as a threshold to select robust radio IDs (e.g. Ivison et al. 2002, 2007) to submillimetre\ngalaxies. We select all mid-infrared sources found within our search\nradii as potential counterparts and use the P statistic to distinguish\nbetween competing IDs when more than one galaxy is found. We\nnote that almost all SMGs listed in Table 8 have mid-infrared coun-\n\n\fGalaxy formation around high-redshift QSOs\n\n9\n\nFractional completeness\n\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n0\n\n5\n10\n15\n850 \u03bcm flux density (mJy)\n\n20\n\n0\n\n5\n10\n15\n850 \u03bcm flux density (mJy)\n\n20\n\nFigure 3.

Luminous galaxies\nat 1 < z < 3 hosting AGN have power-law mid-infrared spectra\nwhereas those without AGN are dominated by starlight in the IRAC\nbands and dust/PAH emission at 24 \u03bcm.\n\nFigure 4. Integral number counts plotted in 1 mJy bins. The QSOs have\nbeen removed from the counts. The dotted line is a best-fit Schechter function to the SHADES counts as described in Coppin et al. (2006) while the\ndashed line is the result of multiplying this fit by 4 and is shown for reference.\n\nterparts for which the computed P value is < 0.05 in at least one\nwaveband, and can therefore be considered robust based on this\ncriterion.\nThe 4 QSOs detected at submillimetre wavelengths have counterparts in all 3 Spitzer bands. In addition, we find counterparts in at\nleast one waveband for \u223c 60 per cent of the SMGs. Postage stamp\nimages of the mid-infrared counterparts are shown in Figs A1 and\nA2 which can be found in Appendix A.\n\nIn Fig. 5 we plot the ratio of 24 and 8 \u03bcm flux density against\nthe ratio of 8 and 4.5 \u03bcm flux density for those objects detected\nin at least two Spitzer bands. We superimpose redshift tracks for\nthe local ULIRGs Mrk 231 (AGN-like SED) and Arp 220 and\nNGC 6240 (starburst-like SEDs). The QSOs and SMGs clearly inhabit a different regions of this diagram. As expected the QSOs\nhave colours more similar to Mrk 231 than to the starburst galaxies.\nThree QSOs have remarkably similar mid-infrared colours given\nthat they were selected on their X-ray properties. The other QSO,\nRX J163308, has significantly different IRAC colours but we note\nfrom the postage stamp image (Fig. A1) that it has a close 'companion' galaxy which is blended with the QSO in our extracted\ncatalogue and will thus contaminate the colours. While the other\nthree QSOs have 8.0/4.5 \u03bcm flux density ratios roughly consistent with the Mrk 231 template at their known redshifts we note\nthat their 24/8.0 \u03bcm flux density ratios appear to be lower than that\nof Mrk 231 by a factor of \u223c 2 which might be related to the relative strength of emission/absorption features. All but one of the\nSMGs on the other hand have mid-infrared colours consistent with\nArp 220 and/or NGC 6240 at 1 < z < 3. The one exception has\ncolours consistent with Arp 220 at 0.1 < z < 0.5 but its faintness\nand non-detection at 24 \u03bcm are more consistent with a Mrk 231like object at 1 < z < 3. It is thus the only SMG in our sample\nfor which mid-infrared colours indicate significant emission from\nan AGN. We thus find no strong evidence for buried AGN in the\nSMGs. Having said this, we note that deep X-ray (e.g. Vignati et\nal. 1999; Netzer et al. 2005) and infrared spectroscopy (e.g. Lutz et\nal. 2003; Armus et al. 2006) observations of NGC 6240 show that\nthis galaxy does in fact host a highly obscured AGN but that the\n\n\f10\n\nJ.

Colour-colour plot for those sources detected in two or three of the observed Spitzer bands (24, 8.0 and 4.5 \u03bcm). The QSOs are plotted as diamonds\nwhile the submillimetre-selected galaxies discovered in their fields are shown as squares. Lines show the redshifted colour tracks of three local ultraluminous\ninfrared galaxies with (Mrk 231) and without (Arp 220 and NGC 6240) obvious signatures of powerful AGNs at mid-infrared wavelengths. Redshifts of 1.0,\n2.0 and 3.0 are marked on each of these tracks.\n\nenergetics are dominated by the starburst. This leaves open the possibility that many of the SMGs contain buried AGN which are not\npowerful enough to dominate over the starburst in the mid-infrared.\n\n8 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\nWe have shown that the number counts of SMGs with flux densities \u223c 2 \u2212 4 mJy in the \u223c 2 arcmin diameter fields surrounding our\nX-ray absorbed QSOs is higher than that found for a blank field.\nMost of these galaxies have mid-infrared colours very similar to\nthe local ULIRG Arp 220 if it were placed at 1 < z < 3. Fitting\nthe millimetre to far-infrared spectrum of Arp 220 with a greybody\nand then integrating to determine the far-infrared luminosity we\nfind LFIR = (1.3 \u00b1 0.1) \u00d7 1012 L\u2299 which corresponds to a starformation rate (SFR) of 224 \u00b1 17 M\u2299 yr\u22121 after applying the usual\nscaling-law (Kennicutt 1998). Using the same greybody fit and applying the appropriate k-correction leads to predicted 850 \u03bcm flux\ndensities of 1.73, 1.44 and 1.42 mJy for Arp 220 at z=1, 2 and 3\nrespectively. The SMGs in our sample have 850 \u03bcm flux densities\nranging from about 3 \u2212 10 mJy implying that their SFRs range between 400 \u2212 1300 M\u2299 yr\u22121 if Arp 220 is indeed a good analogue.\nTherefore, if the starburst can be sustained for a few hundred million years or so then a stellar mass equivalent to that of the bulge of\na large galaxy will be assembled.\nIt is natural to speculate that an over-dense region of space at\nhigh redshift containing galaxies that are capable of building large,\nhomogeneous populations of stars will evolve over cosmic time to\n\nbecome clusters of galaxies containing a population of massive elliptical galaxies. Since it is well established that elliptical galaxies contain dormant SMBHs (e.g. Magorrian et al. 1998), and that\nthese must have assembled at high redshifts where the accretion\nluminosity density peaks, we expect that our SMGs should contain growing black holes, i.e. AGN. How the major growth phase\nof the black hole coincides temporally with the luminous starburst\nthat builds up the stellar mass is a current topic of debate. Indeed,\nmodels predict a range of possibilities (e.g. Archibald et al 2002;\nDi Matteo, Springel & Hernquist 2005) but there must be a link\nbetween the formation of the stars in the bulge and the SMBH because of the tight correlation between their masses found for local\ngalaxies (Ferrarese & Merritt 2000). After a number of early null\nresults using moderate depth X-ray data (e.g. Fabian et al. 2000;\nWaskett et al. 2003) deep X-ray (Alexander et al. 2005a,b, 2008)\nand mid-infrared spectroscopy (Men\u00e9ndez-Delmestre et al. 2007;\nPope et al. 2008) observations show that SMGs found in the field\noften do contain AGN but that the masses of their black holes may\nbe much smaller than those found in high redshift QSOs, and consequently that the bulk of the far-infrared emission is due to the\nstarburst. Moreover, estimates of the host galaxy masses suggest\nthat the growth of the black hole lags the growth of the spheroid\n(Borys et al. 2005; Alexander et al. 2008; see also Coppin et al.\n2009). While this may be the case for SMGs, analysis of massive\ngalaxies selected on other criteria find evidence to the contrary, suggesting that more than one scenario is possible for the formation of\na massive galaxy and its SMBH. For example, studies of powerful\n\n\f12\n\nJ. A. Stevens et al.\n\nradio sources (McLure et al. 2006) and luminous QSOs (Peng et\nal. 2006) suggest that the black-hole mass to bulge luminosity ratio\nincreases towards high redshifts thus indicating that the black hole\nreaches its critical mass before the galaxy bulge is fully formed.\nThe mid-infrared colours of our SMGs also argue against the\npresence of a powerful AGN in these objects unless they are very\nhighly obscured. They are thus either intrinsically different objects\nto the QSO or they are caught at a different time in their evolution.\nPage et al. (2010, in prep.) argue that the X-ray absorption in the\nQSOs has its origin in an ionized absorber associated with a powerful wind capable of terminating the star formation. Such feedback\nis a popular ingredient of models since it leads naturally to the relationship between SMBH mass and spheroid mass discussed above\n(e.g. Fabian 1999). If the SMGs in the same field evolve to form\na cluster of ellipticals then they would presumably go through a\nsimilar evolutionary sequence to the QSO but are caught at an earlier stage of their life cycle at 1 < z < 3. Estimates of the stellar\nmasses would be useful to put further constraints on their evolutionary status. To this end we are currently fitting models to optical\nthrough infrared data to determine photometric redshifts and restframe K-band luminosities; an analysis of the RXJ 094144 field is\ncurrently in progress (Carrera et al. 2010, in prep.).\nOne difference worthy of note between the findings of this\npaper and those for high-redshift (typically z > 3) radio galaxies (HzRGs) concerns very bright SMGs in their fields. Two of\nthe seven HzRG fields imaged with SCUBA contain SMGs with\nS850 > 20 mJy (Stevens et al. 2003) whereas the brightest object found around the QSOs has S850 \u223c 10 mJy. Although the\nsamples are too small to give a statistically significant result it appears that the SMGs detected around the lower redshift, less powerful, radio-quiet AGN have lower S850 . A direct comparison is\nnot informative because the sources were extracted with different\nsignal-to-noise criteria and by different methods but comparing flux\ndensities significantly above the catalogue cut-offs yields 8 SMGs\nwith S850 \u2265 6 mJy in the 7 HzRG fields while only 2 are detected\naround the 5 QSOs.\nGiven the effectively flat relationship between S850 and redshift for 1 < z < 10 this difference in flux density leads to a\nproportional difference in star-formation rates (all other things being equal). There is thus reasonably good evidence for a difference\nin star-formation activity in individual galaxies in these fields indicating that the galaxy formation process might be dependent on\nthe magnitude of the density peak and/or its redshift. For example, in the case of HzRGs it was found that the detection rate increased dramatically at z > 2.5 (Archibald et al. 2001; Reuland\net al. 2004) which is significantly higher than the average redshift\nof our QSO sample. Another possibility is that the radio properties of the central AGN are in some way linked to environmental\ndensity (e.g. Kauffmann, Heckman & Best 2008). Indeed, recent\nwork by Falder et al. (2010) finds evidence for larger over-densities\nof galaxies around radio-loud objects (based on work carried out\nat 3.6 \u03bcm). Perhaps radio synchrotron luminosity is enhanced in\nregions where the inter-galactic medium is more dense.\nAn obvious next step will be to conduct a statistically meaningful survey of fields around AGN over the full range of redshifts in order to track star-formation activity as a function of cosmic time. The next generation bolometer camera on the JCMT\n(SCUBA-2) and SPIRE/PACS on-board the Herschel Space Observatory are instruments with good enough sensitivity to make such a\ncampaign practical. It would also allow a bigger area to be mapped\naround each AGN, better matching the size of proto-cluster regions\npredicted by numerical simulations.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank Ian Smail for extensive comments on the draft manuscript\nand Mark Thompson for useful discussions.

For the RX J094144 field we compare the\nmid-infrared counterparts to the SMGs with those identified previously at optical and near-infrared wavelengths. We also discuss\ncases where likely mid-infrared counterparts were not catalogued\nbecause they fell just outside our formal search radii, and one case\nwhere an obvious SMG was not found by our extraction algorithm;\nthese sources were not included in the analysis described in the\nmain part of this paper.\n\nA1 The RX J094144.51+385434.8 field\nThe SCUBA data for this field were published previously by\nStevens et al. (2004). In the present paper we have treated the\ndata slightly differently in the final reduction stages (rebinning and\nsmoothing). We also apply a formal source extraction algorithm in\nthis work resulting in only 2 sources at 850 \u03bcm and 4 at 450 \u03bcm\nwhereas Stevens et al. (2004) simply identified peaks on the maps\nabove a 3-\u03c3 signal-to-noise threshold, identifying 6 sources. As already noted in Section 4.1 the source extraction algorithm fails to\ndetect sources that are blended which has undoubtedly affected the\n850 \u03bcm extraction. At 450 \u03bcm we can see that sources 450#1 and\n\n13\n\n450#3 appear more elongated than the other two objects hinting\nthat they may be resolved. It was these objects that Stevens et al.\n(2004) identified as blends.\nInspection of the postage stamps shows that source\n850#2/450#2 is coincident with a bright mid-infrared source detected in all 3 Spitzer channels. This object was one of a pair of\nsources detected in the R- and K-bands by Stevens et al. (2004).\nThe new Spitzer data show that the correct identification is the object with the redder R \u2212 K colour since this object becomes progressively more prominent with increasing wavelength compared\nto its neighbour and is detected at 24 \u03bcm.\nSource 450#3 falls in a crowded field. We find 2 possible\nidentifications in the IRAC channels. Of these source 206/160 lies\ncloser to the 450 \u03bcm source centroid and is also coincident with\nfaint (formally undetected) emission at 24 \u03bcm. Source 206/160\nwas not one of the possible identifications discussed by Stevens\net al. (2004) since it is very faint/undetected in the K-band. We\nconclude that the likely identification for this SMG is the very red\nobject 206/160.\nSource 450#4 was matched with an extremely red object\n(R \u2212 K = 5.8) by Stevens et al. (2004). This source is not formally recovered in this work because it lies outside our 5 arcsec\nIRAC search radius but is visible in the postage stamp to the west\nof the 450 \u03bcm centroid as a bright source at 4.5 and 8.0 \u03bcm. Given\nits red colours we consider this object as a likely identification.\nMeasured flux densities are 57.0 \u00b1 5.3 and 48.5 \u00b1 6.1 \u03bcJy at 4.5\nand 8.0 \u03bcm respectively giving a colour similar to Arp 220 at the\nredshift of the QSO. The 4.5-\u03bcm centroid is 6.6 arcsec from the extracted 450 \u03bcm position at 09h 41m 43s .61, +38\u25e6 54\u2032 24\u2032\u2032 .5 while\nthe 8.0-\u03bcm centroid is 6.4 arcsec from the extracted 450 \u03bcm position at 09h 41m 43s .64, +38\u25e6 54\u2032 24\u2032\u2032 .6. The calculated P-statistic\nis 0.089 and 0.064 at 4.5 and 8.0 \u03bcm respectively.\n\nA2 The RX J121803.82+470854.6 field\nIn Section 4.3 we noted that the QSO in this field was not found by\nour extraction algorithm but was detected by Page et al. (2001). The\nlatter observations used SCUBA in 'photometry' mode where the\ncentral bolometer of each array is centred on the target but no image\nis made. Inspection of Fig. 1 shows that while there is submillimetre emission at the location of the QSO (located below source 5\non the 850 \u03bcm image) the surrounding structure is complex. It is\nthus possible that the source extraction algorithm failed to locate a\nsignificant peak because of blending. It is also likely that the photometry observation of this object reported by Page et al. (2001) is\ncontaminated by emission from the SMGs close to the QSO.\nIn Table 8 we noted that object 850#5 has a likely false identification at 24 \u03bcm. This can also be attributed to the crowded field\nclose to the QSO since it is the QSO itself that has fallen within the\nsearch radius at 24 \u03bcm while it was not picked up in the smaller\nsearch radii adopted for the IRAC channels.\n\nA3 The RX J124913.86\u2212055906.2 field\nSource 850#2 has no listed identification in Table 8 but the postage\nstamp images show bright 4.5 and 8.0 \u03bcm sources close to the\n850 \u03bcm centroid. The closest 4.5 \u03bcm source is at 12h 49m 15s .19,\n\u221205\u25e6 58\u2032 40\u2032\u2032 .9 which at 5.3 arcsec from the SMG is only just\noutside our formal search radius. This object has a flux density of\n17.7\u00b13.0 \u03bcJy and is coincident with an 8.0 \u03bcm source although the\nlatter is not detected by SE XTRACTOR. Inspection of the 8.0 \u03bcm\n\n\f14\n\nJ. A. Stevens et al.\n\nimage reveals that the diffraction spike from the bright QSO at the\nfield centre falls on top of this object probably explaining the nondetection. Although the P-statistic for the 4.5 \u03bcm source is high at\n0.259 we consider this object as a likely identification because of\nits detection in both IRAC bands.\nSources 850#4 and 850#4 have an obvious identification in\nthe IRAC bands as well as faint (formally undetected) emission at\n24 \u03bcm.\nA4 The RX J163308.57+570258.7 field\nSource 850#4 has no listed identification in Table 8 but the postage\nstamp images show a bright 4.5 and 8.0 \u03bcm source close to the\n850 \u03bcm centroid along with faint (formally undetected) emission\nat 24 \u03bcm. The 4.5 \u03bcm source is located at 16h 33m 10s .15,\n+57\u25e6 02\u2032 10\u2032\u2032 .2 only 5.2 arcsec from the SMG, has a flux density of 12.9 \u00b1 2.6 and a P-statistic of 0.266. The 8.0 \u03bcm source is\nlocated at 16h 33m 10s .08, +57\u25e6 02\u2032 09\u2032\u2032 .3 only 5.9 arcsec from\nthe SMG, has a flux density of 17.6 \u00b1 4.5 and a P-statistic of 0.198.\nThis object has IRAC colours similar to Arp 220 at the redshift of\nthe QSO. The proximity of this object to the SMG together with its\ndetection in in both IRAC bands make it a likely identification.\nInspection of the 850 \u03bcm map for this field (Fig. 1)\nshows submillimetre emission north of the QSO at approximately\n16h 33m 05s .75, +57\u25e6 04\u2032 11\u2032\u2032 .7. There is a negative region to\nthe east of this position which is consistent with a negative image\nof the source located at one of the off-positions. The western offposition would fall off the map. We believe that this is a real SMG\n(probably two sources) which was missed by the extraction algorithm because of its proximity to the edge of the map. Inspection of\nthe postage stamp images reinforces this belief since we find two\n24 \u03bcm sources coincident with the SMG position and at the same\napproximate position angle as the 850 \u03bcm emission. The IRAC data\nreveal 3 and 5 sources at 4.5 and 8.0 \u03bcm respectively. The southern\n24/850 \u03bcm source has two possible IRAC identifications. Of these,\nsource 260/232 is the brightest and reddest object; its 8.0/4.5 \u03bcm\nflux density ratio is 1.96 \u00b1 0.22. If source 10 is the 24 \u03bcm counterpart then the ratio of flux densities at 24 and 8.0 \u03bcm is 4.60 \u00b1 0.99\nwhich would place this object on the Mrk 231 curve shown in Fig 5\nindicating that it hosts a buried AGN, possibly at a lower redshift\nthan RX J163308. The northern 24/850 \u03bcm source has 1 counterpart at 4.5 \u03bcm and 3 at 8.0 \u03bcm although the 4.5 \u03bcm emission is\nextended in the same manner as that at 8.0 \u03bcm implying that this\nSMG could have multiple mid-infrared counterparts. Inspection of\nthe flux densities presented in Table 8 shows that the IRAC colours\nare similar to those of Arp 220 at the redshift of the QSO so this\nsource is unlikely to host an AGN. Since this system is one of the\nmost interesting in our sample we include it in Table 8 as source\n850#7 although it is not included in the 850 \u03bcm number counts\nanalysis because it was not found by the extraction algorithm.\nThis paper has been typeset from a TEX/ LATEX file prepared by the\nauthor.\n\n\fGalaxy formation around high-redshift QSOs\n\n175\n\n223\n\n272\n\n15\n\n203\n\nRX J094144 850#1\n\n256\n\n180\n\n242\n\n188\n\n155\n191\n\nRX J094144 850#3\n\n339\n\n241\n261\n\n200\n\nFigure A1.
