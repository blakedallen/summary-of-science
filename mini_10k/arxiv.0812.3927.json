In doing so we find a ballistic mean free path of\nLball=300\u00b1100nm at room-temperature for a carrier\nconcentration of ~1012cm-2 and that a substantial series\nresistance of around 300\u03a9\u03bcm has to be taken into account.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate first quantum capacitance\nmeasurements on single-layer graphene devices.\n\ntransconductance per channel width (gm/W) (top of Fig. 2).\nFor L>2\u03bcm on the other hand, gm/W decreases\n\nIntroduction\nWith the need to ever further improve the performance of\nfield-effect transistors (FETs) researchers are evaluating\nvarious novel channel materials. The most recent candidate\nthat has sparked a substantial amount of excitement is\ngraphene. Graphene occurs to be an ideal choice for FET\napplications since it combines a) an ultra-thin body for\naggressive channel length scaling with b) excellent\nintrinsic transport properties [1-4] similar to carbon\nnanotubes but with c) the chance to pattern the desired\ndevice structures within a top-down lithographical\napproach [5,6]..\nMean Free Path Extraction\nFirst, we will discuss devices that utilize the silicon\nsubstrate as a back-gate. This approach reduces the\nlikelihood of multiple-step sample processing - as\nnecessary for a top-gate - impacting the electrical\nproperties of graphene. We have fabricated FETs of\nvarious channel lengths (L) and widths (W) using heavily\np-doped Si substrates covered with 300nm SiO2, as shown\nin Fig. 1. Exemplary Id-Vgs characteristics of four devices\nwith distinctly different L are shown in Fig. 2. One can\nclearly identify the expected ambipolar device\ncharacteristics with a minimum close to Vgs=0 that is\nassociated with the Dirac point of graphene. Fig. 3\nillustrates schematically how the gate voltage impacts the\ntransport through the graphene layer. While we observe\nthat Id(Vgs)/W varies from device to device, we find that\ndevice characteristics of FETs with L in the one\nmicrometer range and below exhibit almost identical\n\nFig. 1: Scanning electron microscopy images of\nback-gated graphene field-effect transistors with\nvarious channel lengths and widths.\nmonotonically with increasing L as evident from the\nbottom part of Fig. 2. All measurements were performed in\nthe linear Id-Vds range with Vds=-10mV (Fig. 4). When\nemploying diffusive transport equations to determine \u03bc, a\nrather peculiar mobility versus channel length dependence\nis revealed (dots in Fig. 5). [Note, that our approach is\ndifferent from other groups' extraction of mobility in that\nwe are using gm instead of Id/(Vgs-VDirac). Since graphene\nFETs do not turn off for any gate voltage due to the\nabsence of an energy gap, Id/(Vgs-VDirac) is an inappropriate\nmeasure of the device mobility and overestimates \u03bc\nsubstantially. In addition, this approach results in a nonphysical Vgs dependence of \u03bc.] For L larger than around\n1\u03bcm, \u03bc is constant indicating diffusive transport. However,\nfor smaller channel lengths, \u03bc decreases linearly with\ndecreasing L. The linear dependence of \u03bc on L is simply a\nresult of the fact that gm/W is almost independent of L for\nconstant Cox/(WL) and Vds. There are two explanations for\nthe observed \"artificial\" degradation of mobility with\ndecreasing L. 1) \u03bc(L) decreases with L since a substantial\nseries resistance that does not scale with L is present in the\ndevices. 2) \u03bc(L) decreases since the channel length\n\n\fFig. 3: Schematic of the band movement of\ngraphene as a function of Vgs. The resulting Vshaped Id-Vgs is shown on the right. High currents\nare obtained for both positive and negative gate\nvoltages.\n\nFig. 2: Room-temperature current per channel width\nvs. Vgs for four samples with different channel length\nL. Vds=-10mV and tox=300nm SiO2.\nbecomes comparable to the scattering length \u03bb and devices\nexhibit ballistic or quasi-ballistic transport properties. One\nof the common approaches to extract the mean free path of\ngraphene FETs is by purely relying on the device transfer\ncharacteristics and assuming that any conductivity\ndifference from the ballistic limit arises from scattering in\nthe channel. Mean free paths of 10-100nm are frequently\nextracted in this way [7]. Employing the same approach\nfor our devices indeed results in a ballistic mean free path\nof around 100nm. However, this value is inconsistent with\nthe obtained \u03bc(L) plot in Fig. 5. A much too steep fit (not\nshown) is obtained for this \u03bb-value.\n\nInstead, using exclusively the data from Fig. 5 would result\nin a ballistic mean free path of around 600nm when\nemploying \u03bc=\u03bc0*L/(\u03bb+L). The apparent inconsistency\nbetween the two methods can be overcome and a coherent\npicture can be obtained if both aspects 1) and 2) from\nabove are considered simultaneously. The black curve in\nFig. 5 considers both, the transition into the ballistic\nregime as well as a length independent series resistance.\nWe extract a mean free path of 300\u00b1100nm and a series\nresistance of around 300\u03a9\u03bcm (R*W) that can explain our\nId-Vgs and \u03bc(L) data sets consistently. Such an additional\nresistance is not as surprising as it appears at a first glance.\nIn fact, an intrinsic, graphene related series resistance has\nbeen previously observed and was explained by the\npresence of an internal p/n junction inside the graphene\nand by contact induced scattering at the metal/graphene\ninterface [8]. Here we show that extracting the intrinsic\ngraphene properties requires considering this series\nresistance and that it is important to design devices\naccordingly. Note, that our statement about the ballistic\nmean free path value is only valid for high enough carrier\nconcentrations (ns) since gm is extracted in the linear Id-Vgs\nregime at voltages that correspond to ns-values of around\n1012cm-2 and above.\nQuantum Capacitance Measurements\nNext, we turn our attention to the device capacitance. In\norder to verify that the calculated Cox values used to extract\n\n\fdevices in this way becoming the dominant contribution to\nthe total capacitance Ctot.\n\nFig. 4: Id-Vds characteristics of a back-gated graphene\nFET at room-temperature.\n\nFig. 6: Bottom: Schematic layout of a top-gated\ngraphene FET. Top: Partially-gated device (left) and\ncapacitance components involved (right).\n\n\u03bc are accurate and to elucidate on the impact of scaling, we\nhave performed C-V measurements on various top-gated\ngraphene FETs. The device layout as well as an SEM\nimage of a representative device is shown in Fig. 6.\nConsidering the conducting graphene layer without a band\ngap as the counter electrode to the metal top gate, one may\nexpect to measure a constant capacitance Cox. However, as\nillustrated in the capacitor network in Fig. 6, the so-called\nquantum capacitance needs to be taken into account for\nlow-dimensional systems in general. The quantum\ncapacitance Cq describes the response of the charge inside\nthe channel to the conduction and valence band movement.\n\nFig. 5: Mobility versus channel length extracted for\nvarious graphene FETs assuming diffusive transport\nconditions.\nCq is proportional to the density of states (DOS). While Cq\nis large in conventional systems and can be neglected\naccordingly, it can be very small in low-dimensional\n\nFig. 7: Id-Vgs (top) and total capacitance (bottom)\nfor a top-gated single layer and multi-layer\ngraphene FET with 10nm Al2O3.\n\n\fFig. 7 shows Id-Vgs and Ctot-Vgs measurements for a\nsingle- and a multi-layer graphene FET. While both\ndevices show a clear variation of current with gate\nvoltage independent of the number of graphene layers,\nCq only shows a pronounced Vgs-dependence for the\nsingle layer graphene FET. As illustrated in the inset of\nthe bottom graph of Fig. 7, the difference in DOS (~Cq)\nis the key to understand this behavior, a distinguishing\nfact that had not been noticed previously. Next we\nextract Cq(E) from the measurements using the capacitor\nnetwork in Fig. 6. For a constant oxide and trap\ncapacitance of Cox=5.6fF/\u03bcm2 and Ctr=10fF/\u03bcm2\nrespectively the anticipated Cq(E)-dependence is\nobtained (Fig. 8). Not only is the extracted Cox-value\nclose to the geometrical value of 5.8fF/\u03bcm2, but the\nactual Cq-values as a function of energy are the same for\ndifferent single-layer graphene devices and are\nfollowing the theoretical expectation when assuming a\ndensity of states DOS = aE / = v F \u03c0 with a=1. Note,\nthat this DOS is a quarter of the usually found\nexpression. While the high ac voltage of 0.2V employed\nto perform the capacitance measurement can explain a\nreduction of Cq by a factor of two [9], it is currently\nunclear why our experimental data are off by another\nfactor of 2. We note that the conversion of the gate\nvoltage axis into an energy axis is a possible source of\nerror in this context.\n2 2\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, we measured mobility vs. channel length for\nback-gated graphene FETs and identified the existence of a\nseries resistance in the vicinity of the graphene contact\narea. Using both, the Id-Vgs characteristics and \u03bc(L) data,\nwe are able to extract the mean free path of the graphene\nchannel to be 300\u00b1100nm for graphene FETs fabricated on\nSiO2 substrates. Next, we showed first capacitance\nmeasurements on top-gated FETs and extracted the\nquantum capacitance of graphene. Our experimental\nfindings give critical insights into the importance of Cq for\nscaled graphene FETs. Even in the case of tox=10nm as in\nthe present case, the small Cq-value close to E=0\ndominates the total device capacitance and needs to be\nincluded in the mobility extraction for the corresponding\ncarrier concentrations. More aggressively scaled graphene\nFETs require taking into account an even larger energy and correspondingly carrier concentration - range. Our\nresults also indicate that for the thick oxides used in the\nback-gated devices we have analyzed above, it is justified\nto ignore Cq at the gate voltage levels used to extract \u03bc.\nAcknowledgement\nThe authors would like to thank Dr. Oki Gunawan for his\nhelp with the C-V measurement set-up.\nReferences\n\nFig. 8: Extracted quantum capacitance Cq as a\nfunction of energy.
