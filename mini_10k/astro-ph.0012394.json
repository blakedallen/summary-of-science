There is the hope that\nthese solitary stars will eventually appear as faint sources in the Chandra sky survey.\nThis might give insight on the long term evolution of the magnetic field in isolated\nobjects.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe amount of rotation and the strength of the magnetic field determine many\nof the neutron star's observational properties. Over the neutron star lifetime, the\nspin and the field change and the study of their evolution provides important\nclues into the physics of the stellar interior.\nOf the billion neutron stars in the Galaxy, we shall be mainly concerned\nwith the evolution of two distinct populations: The millisecond pulsars and the\nisolated neutron stars both aging, the first in low mass binaries, the second as\nfield stars moving in the interstellar medium of our Milky Way. We will show\nthat the interaction with their surroundings may profoundly alter their spin\nand magnetic field. The extent of these changes and the modes vary in the two\nscenarios. It is in exploring this diversity that we wish to infer the nature of\nthe equation of state and to provide a unified view of field decay. In particular,\nthe existence of \"unconventional\" sources, such as sub-millisecond pulsars, stars\nrotating close to their break up limit, and as solitary neutron stars accreting\n\n\f2\n\nMonica Colpi et al.\n\nthe interstellar medium, is a crucial test for our studies. Their discovery is an\nobservational and theoretical challenge.\nIn Section 2 we trace the evolution of a neutron star in the Ejector, Propeller\nand Accretion phases, described briefly using simple background arguments.\nSection 3 surveys the physical models for the evolution of the magnetic field both\nin isolated and accreting systems. In Section 4 we explore possible individual\npathways that may lead to the formation, in low mass binaries, of neutron stars\nspinning very close to their mass shedding threshold, a limit sensitive to the\nequation of state for nuclear matter. Pathways of isolated neutron stars follow.\nThe first four sections set the general background used to construct, in Sections\n5 and 6, statistical models aimed at determining the presence and abundance of\nsub-millisecond pulsars in the Galaxy, and of solitary neutron stars shining in\nthe X-rays. Specifically, in Section 5 we explore, within the recycling scenario,\nthe star's spin and magnetic evolution using physical models and the role played\nby disc instabilities in affecting the latest phases of binary evolution toward the\nEjector state of sub-millisecond pulsars. In Section 6 we carry out the first stellar\ncensus. We then establish how elusive neutron stars can be as accreting sources\nfrom the interstellar medium due to their large velocities and to magnetic field\ndecay.\n\n2\n\nThe Ejector, Propeller and Accretion Phases\n\nOver the stellar lifetime, magnetic and hydrodynamic torques acting on the\nneutron star (NS hereafter) induce secular changes in its spin rate. Four physical\nparameters determine the extent of the torques: the magnetic field strength B,\nthe rotational period P, the density of the surrounding (interstellar) medium\nn, and the rate of mass inflow \u1e40 toward the NS. According to the magnitude\nof these quantities, a NS experiences three different evolutionary paths: Ejector\n(E), Propeller (P), and Accretion (A) [1]. In phase E the NS braking results\nfrom the loss of magneto-dipole radiation as in an ordinary pulsar. The implied\nspin-down rate is\n2\u03c0 2 \u03bc2\ndP\n= 3\n,\ndt\nc I P\n\n(1)\n\nwhere I is the NS moment of inertia and \u03bc = Bs Rs3 /2 the NS magnetic moment, function of the stellar radius Rs and polar magnetic field Bs . The torque\ndecreases with increasing P , and at the current period P (much longer than the\ninitial period) the time spent in phase E is\n\u03c4E =\n\nc3 I P 2\n.\n4\u03c0 2 \u03bc2\n\n(2)\n\nResulting from the emission of electromagnetic waves and charged particles, the\nrotational energy loss of equation (1) can proceed well beyond the active radiopulsar phase and the magneto-dipolar outflow creates a hollow cavern nesting\n\n\fSpin and magnetism in old neutron stars\n\n3\n\nthe NS. Phase E remains active as long as the characteristic radius rst of this\ncavern (the stopping radius [1] [2]) is larger than both the light cylinder radius\ncP\n2\u03c0\n\nrlc =\n\n(3)\n\nand the gravitational radius\nrG =\n\n2GM\n2\n+ vrel\n\n(4)\n\nc2s\n\nwhere cs is the sound speed of the interstellar medium (ISM) and vrel the NS\nvelocity relative to the medium. Phase E ends when matter leaks through rst ,\nand this occurs when the period exceeds\n2\u03c0 3/4 1/2 1/2 \u22121/4\nPE\u2192P = \u221a\n\u03bc v \u033a\nc 2GM\n\n(5)\n\n2 1/2\nwhere v = (c2s + vrel\n)\nand \u033a is the mass density of the ISM [3]. At PE\u2192P\nthe outflowing pulsar momentum flux is unable to balance the ram pressure\nof the gravitationally captured matter at rG [3]. Matter initiates its infall and\napproaches the magnetospheric radius (or Alfven radius)\n\nrA =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03bc4\n2GM \u1e40 2\n\n\u00131/7\n\n.\n\n(6)\n\nHere the magnetic pressure of the dipolar stellar field (\u221d r\u22126 ) balances the ram\npressure of the infalling material (\u221d r\u22125/2 ), accreting at a rate \u1e40 . At rA the\nsteeply rising magnetic field would thread the flow, enforcing it to corotation.\nHowever, not always can matter pass this edge: penetration is prevented whenever the rotational speed \u03a9 of the uniformly rotating magnetosphere exceeds the\n3 1/2\nlocal Keplerian velocity \u03c9K (= [GM/rA\n] ) at rA . This condition translates into\na comparison between the corotation radius\nrcor =\n\n\u0012\n\nGM\n\u03a92\n\n\u00131/3\n\n(7)\n\nand rA . When rcor lies inside rA the magnetosphere centrifugally lifts the plasma\nabove its escape velocity, inhibiting its further infall toward the NS surface: this\nis the propeller phase P. The magnetically driven torques lead to a secular spindown of the NS occurring at a rate\nd\n2\n(I\u03a9) = \u03be \u1e40 rcor\n[\u03c9K (rA ) \u2212 \u03a9] ,\ndt\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \u1e40 is the accretion rate at rA , and \u03be a numerical factor dependent on\nthe accretion pattern, ranging from \u03be \u2243 1 for disc accretion to \u03be \u2243 10\u22122 for\nspherical accretion. The effectiveness of the propeller in spinning down the NS\nand in ejecting matter far out from the magnetosphere is still largely model\n\n\f4\n\nMonica Colpi et al.\n\ndependent [4]. Recently, evidence that this mechanism is at work in binaries of\nhigh [5] and low mass [6] has come from X-ray observations.\nPhase P terminates only when the corotation radius rcor increases above\nrA ; thereon the NS is able to accept matter directly onto its surface: this is the\naccretion phase A. The transition P \u2192 A occurs at a critical NS spin rate PP\u2192A\nobtained by equating rA and rcor :\nPP\u2192A\n\n2\u03c0\n= \u221a\nGM\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03bc4\n2GM \u1e40 2\n\n\u00133/14\n\n\u221d\n\nB 6/7\n.\n\u1e40 3/7\n\n(9)\n\nIn isolated NS, the accretion flow is almost spherically symmetric and the\nNS period P, after the onset of A, may vary erratically due to the positive and\nnegative random torques resulting from the turbulent ISM [7] [8] 1\nIn a disc-like geometry (in binaries) the spin evolution during accretion is\nguided by the advective, magnetic and viscous torques present in the disc. Depending on their relative magnitude, these torques can either spin the NS up or\ndown. The rate of change of the NS angular momentum is obtained integrating\nthe different contributions over the whole disc, yielding\nZ \u221e\nR3 h\nd\n2\nBz2\n(I\u03a9) \u2243 \u1e40 rA\n\u03c9K (rA ) +\n[\u03c9K (R) \u2212 \u03a9]dR ,\n(10)\ndt\n\u03b7\nrA\nwhere \u03b7 is the plasma electrical diffusivity, h the disc scale thickness and R the\nradial cylindrical coordinate (in eq. 10 we neglect the local viscous contribution as it vanishes at rA ). The first term in the rhs of equation (10) describes\nthe advection of angular momentum by accretion. Magnetic torques are instead\nnon-local, resulting from an integral that extends over the whole disc: different\nregions can give either positive (spin-up) or negative contributions (spin-down).\nWhen \u03a9 \u226b \u03c9K (rA ), the integrand in (10) is negative yielding a spin-down magnetic torque. On the other hand, if the star rotates very slowly (\u03a9 \u226a \u03c9K (rA ))\nthe overall magnetic torque is positive, leading to a secular spin-up: when the\ntotal torque is positive the spin-up process is termed recycling. At a critical (intermediate) value of \u03a9, termed equilibrium angular velocity \u03c9eq , the magnetic\ntorque is negative, and its value exactly offsets the (positive) advective torque.\nIn this regime the NS accretes matter from the disc without exchanging angular\nmomentum at all. The precise value of \u03c9eq is rather uncertain, but it ought to\nlie between 0.71 \u2212 0.95 times the critical frequency \u03c9cr = 2\u03c0/PP\u2192A , in the mid\nof the propeller and accretor regimes (see [9] and references therein). Since \u03c9cr\nand \u03c9eq have near values, they are often confused in the literature. There is a\nnarrow range for \u03a9 between \u03c9eq and \u03c9cr within which the NS accretes mass but\nspins down.\nOnce the star has reached its equilibrium period Peq = 2\u03c0/\u03c9eq , further\nchanges in the spin period P are possible only if the magnetic field and/or\n1\n\nOld accreting isolated NSs are thus expected to show strong fluctuations of \u1e56 over\na time scale comparable to the crossing time \u03c4fluct \u223c min(rISM , rG )/vrel , where rISM\nis the spatial scale of the ISM inhomogeneities.\n\n\fSpin and magnetism in old neutron stars\n\n5\n\n\u1e40 vary. Generally, field decay causes the star to slide along the so called spin-up\nline where the period P takes the value Peq (\u03bc, \u1e40 ), at the current values of \u03bc and\n\u1e40 . A large increase in the mass transfer rate can induce further spin-up since\nthe magnetosphere at rA is squeezed in a region of higher Keplerian velocity.\nA decrease in \u1e40 has the opposite effect and if there is a decline in the mass\ntransfer rate (due to disc instabilities and/or perturbations in the atmosphere of\nthe donor star), the NS can transit from A \u2192 P \u2192 E. The critical period for the\nlast transition does not coincide with equation (5), but occurs when the Alfven\nradius rA (function of the mass transfer rate \u1e40 ) exceeds the light cylinder radius\nrlc (eqs. 3 and 6), i.e., when\nPP\u2192E\n\n2\u03c0\n=\nc\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03bc4\n2GM \u1e40 2\n\n\u00131/7\n\n,\n\n(11)\n\n(note that this transition is not symmetric relative to E \u2192 P). Over the stellar\nlifetime, NSs can trace loops moving through the various phases (P \u2194 A or/and\nP \u2194 E). It may happen that rA increases above rG when \u1e40 is very low (as in\nthe ISM): in this case the star is in the so called Georotator state (G).\nThe major drivers of the NS evolution are magnetic field decay (though\namplification is an interesting possibility) and variations in the mass transfer\nrate: their study is thus the subject of \u00a73 and \u00a74.\n\n3\n\nMagnetic field evolution\n\nIn the \u03bc versus P diagram of pulsars (PSRs) we clearly find NSs endowed with\nintense magnetic fields (the canonical pulsars) and NSs with a much lower magnetic moment, the \"millisecond\" pulsars (MSPs). The first are isolated objects\nand largely outnumber the millisecond pulsars often living in binaries with degenerate companion stars. The origin of this observational dichotomy seems understood but the physical mechanisms driving the field evolution remain still\nuncertain. We review here current ideas for the evolution of the B field. They\nare applied later when investigating (i) the existence of sub-millisecond pulsars,\nand (ii) the nature of the six isolated NSs discovered by Rosat.\n3.1\n\nHistorical and observational outline\n\nSoon after the discovery of PSRs, Ostriker & Gunn [10] proposed that their surface magnetic field should not remain constant but decay. Under this assumption\nthey explained the absence of PSRs with periods much longer than one second\n(the decay of \u03bc would bring the objects below the death line, turning off the\nactive radio emission [11]) and the claimed dimming of the radio luminosity LR\nproportional to \u03bc2 [12]. Their pioneering statistical study suggested that the NSs\nat birth have very high magnetic moments \u03bc \u2243 1029 \u00f7 1031 G cm3 , whose values\ndecay exponentially due to ohmic dissipation in the NS interior, on a typical\ntime-scale [13]\n\n\f6\n\nMonica Colpi et al.\n\n\u03c4\u03bc = 4\u03c3Rs2 /\u03c0c2 ,\n\n(12)\n\nwhere \u03c3 is the conductivity, taken as uniform. Ostriker & Gunn evaluated \u03c4\u03bc\nusing the electrical conductivity for the crystallized crust (\u2243 0.6 \u00d7 1023 sec\u22121\n[14]), thereby assuming implicitly that the magnetic field resides in the outer\nlayers (\u03c1 < 1014 g cm\u22123 ) of the star, and obtained \u03c4\u03bc \u223c 4 \u00d7 106 yr. But in the\nsame year, Baym, Pethick & Pines [15] argued that the magnetic field pervades\nthe entire star and so one had to adopt the much higher \u03c3 of the core, thus\npredicting a very long \u03c4\u03bc exceeding the Hubble time, a result confirmed [16] in\n1971 when different conductivities in the NS interior were taken into account.\nWhen a larger number of pulsars became available for statistics, many authors\ncompared the observations with population synthesis Monte Carlo models. At\nfirst [17] data seemed to support evidence for field decay, but subsequent investigations [18] [19] [20] [21] have indicated that the observed PSR population is\ncompatible with no decay or with decay on time-scales \u03c4\u03bc > 108 yr longer than\nthe pulsar phase, beyond which the NSs become practically invisible. There is\na way to probe indirectly the possible decay of the field by searching for those\nold NSs moving with low speed (< 40 km s\u22121 ) that can gravitationally capture\nthe interstellar medium and shine as dim accreting sources. As discussed in \u00a76,\ntheir presence in the Galaxy depends on the evolution of the field.\nAs far as the old MSPs are concerned, these sources possess very low values\nof \u03bc \u223c 7 \u00d7 1025 \u2212 1027 G cm3 [22] when they appear as pulsars. The observations\nare again consistent with no field decay over their radio active phase, a result\ninferred from the old age of the dwarf companion stars, that implies a \u03c4\u03bc at least\ncomparable to their true galactic age [23][24][25][26]. This does not preclude from\nthe possibility that field decay has occurred during their previous evolution: this\nis discussed and described in \u00a73.4.\nIn the next sections we survey the models for the decay of the magnetic field\nboth for isolated NSs and for the NSs in binaries.\n3.2\n\nField evolution in isolated objects: spontaneous decay?\n\nModels for magnetic field decay in isolated NSs flourished over the last decade.\nA first improvement was to abandon the hypothesis of a uniform conductivity in\nthe stellar crust and core; \u03c3 increases when moving from the outer liquid layers\nto the deeper crystallized crust [27]. Sang & Chanmugam [28] noticed that the\ndecay of a field residing only in the crust is not strictly exponential because of its\ninward diffusion toward regions of higher \u03c3. Moreover, the decay rate depends\non the (highly uncertain) depth penetrated by the initial field: the decay is more\nrapid if, at birth, the field resides in the outer lower density regions of the crust\nboth because \u03c3 is lower and because \u03c4\u03bc depends on the length scale of field\ngradients (less than a tenth of the stellar radius R if \u03bc is confined in the crust).\nThe inclusion, in the calculation, of the cooling history of the NS was a second\nmajor improvement [29] [30] [31]. It confirmed the non exponential behavior\nof the decay, showing in addition that a slower cooling would accelerate the\n\n\fSpin and magnetism in old neutron stars\n\n7\n\n< 106\ndecay (as a warmer star has a lower conductivity). A first short phase ( \u223c\nyr) of comparatively rapid decay was found, during which \u03bc drops from values\n\u223c 6 \u00f7 30 \u00d7 1030 G cm3 , typical of young pulsars in supernova remnants, to more\ncanonical values \u223c 1\u00f73\u00d71030 G cm3 typical of normal PSRs. (During this phase\nthe electron-phonon interaction dominates \u03c3). A second phase of no decay was\nfound lasting 10 \u00f7 300 Myr, followed by a power-law decay (dominated by the\ninteraction of the electron upon the impurities) and eventually an exponential\ndecay.\nIf the field penetrates the whole star, the core ohmic decay time-scale would\nbe too long to allow decay [32]. Thus, an alternative scenario was proposed on\nthe hypothesis that NSs have superfluid and superconducting cores. The angular\nmomentum of the core is believed to be carried by [33] Nvortex \u2243 2 \u00d7 1016 /Psec\nneutron vortex lines, parallel to the spin axis; the magnetic flux should be confined in Nfluxoid quantized proton flux tubes, where Nfluxoid \u2243 1032 BC,13 , with\nBC,13 the average field strength in the core, expressed in units of 1013 G. In\n1990, Srinivasan et al. [34] suggested that the inter-pinning [35] between these\nquantized entities causes the fluxoids to be carried and deposited in the crust\nas the NS spins down. The magnetic flux penetrated into the crust will then\ndecay due to ohmic dissipation and the surface magnetic field of the NS keeps\ndecreasing until it relaxes at the value of the residual field in the core. In this\nframework the spin history of the star drives and controls the changes of the\nmagnetic field. Assuming the same radial velocity for both the fluxoids and the\nvortices this model implies a time-evolution\n\u22121/4\n\n\u03bc(t) = \u03bc0 ( 1 + t/\u03c4sdd )\n\n(13)\n\noccurring on a spin down time\n\u03c4sdd \u223c 8 \u00d7 106 P02 I45 \u03bc\u22122\n0,30 yr,\n\n(14)\n\nwhere index 0 denotes values at the onset of phase E, and I45 the NS moment of\ninertia in units of 1045 g cm2 . Equation (13) models the simplest version of the\nspin down driven (sdd) decay of \u03bc in isolated NSs. It can be refined, accounting\nfor the non instantaneous relaxation of the surface magnetic field to the value\nin the core [36].\nDisappointedly, until now it has not been possible to perform a reliable statistical test of all the models. They predict clearly distinct evolutionary pathways\nonly during the early stage of the pulsar life, namely during the first 106 yr after\nbirth. Therefore a large sample of young NSs is requested for a comparison. Up\nto now, the pulsar catalog lists only an handful of such objects, as the observed\nPSR population is dominated by elder sources, with characteristic time of few\n107 yr. In such situation, there is no statistical clue for rejecting the hypothesis\nof a non decaying field. Some of the surveys in progress, as the one running at\nParkes [37], dedicated to the search of young PSRs, could ultimately solve this\nproblem.\n\n\f8\n\nMonica Colpi et al.\n\n3.3\n\nMagnetic field evolution in binaries: accretion driven scenario\n\nNone of the models for spontaneous decay, proposed so far for the isolated objects, can explain magnetic moments of \u223c 1026 G cm3 , which are typical of the\nmillisecond PSRs. In order to attain these values of \u03bc over a Hubble time, the\ncrustal models would require currents located only in a narrow layer below a\ndensity \u03c1 < 6 \u00d7 1010 gcm\u22123 , a very unlikely possibility. On the other hand, the\n\"sdd\" models would predict only a modest decrease of \u03bc, at most of two orders\nof magnitude with respect to the initial values. However, one common feature\ngroups the low-\u03bc objects, i.e., that all the PSRs with low magnetic moment spent\na part of their life in a multiple stellar system. Guided by this fact, many authors\nhave tried to relate the low values of \u03bc with the interaction between the NS and\nits companion star(s). Two different scenarios have been proposed so far: (i) The\naccretion driven scenario developed under the hypothesis of a crustal magnetic\nfield; (ii) The spin driven scenario lying on the hypothesis of a core magnetic\nfield.\nIn this section we consider scenario (i) taking the hypothesis that the currents generating the field are located deep in the crust 2 . A first observational\nsuggestion about the effects of the accretion on a (crustal) magnetic field was\ngiven in 1986 by Taam & van den Heuvel [40]: they noticed an approximate\ndependence of the surface magnetic field on the amount of mass accreted onto\nthe neutron star. Shibazaki et al. [41] later presented an empirical formula for\nthe decay in presence of accretion:\n\u03bc =\n\n\u03bc0\n1 + \u2206Macc /m\u2217\n\n(15)\n\nwhere \u03bc0 represents the magnetic moment at the onset of accretion, \u2206Macc is the\namount of accreted mass and m\u2217 a parameter to be fitted with the observations.\nThese authors claimed that m\u2217 \u223c 10\u22124 M\u2299 could reproduce the Taam & van den\nHeuvel's correlation. Zhang, Wu & Yang [42] [43] gave physical foundation to (15)\nassuming that the compressed accreted matter has ferromagnetic permeability.\nHowever, using a larger database Wijers [44] showed that these models are not\nfully consistent with the available data both on X-ray binaries and recycled\npulsars. Romani [45] first introduced the accretion rate \u1e40 as a second parameter\nin driving the magnetic moment decay in addition to \u2206Macc . He pointed out that\nthe accretion produces two major effects: (i) heating of the crust (depending on\n\u1e40 ), which determines a reduction of the conductivity (and in turn the hastening\nof ohmic decay) and (ii) advection of the field screened by the diamagnetic\n< 1027\naccreted material. Moreover, the advection of the field lines stops when \u03bc \u223c\n3\nG cm , resulting in an asymptotic value for the magnetic moment (in agreement\nwith the observations).\n2\n\nThe onset of a thermo-magnetic instability, which transforms heat into magnetic\nenergy at the moment of NS formation, is an effective mechanism to produce strong\nfields in the crust of a NS [38] [39]. Although this instability is not yet completely\nexplored for poloidal fields, it is a plausible mechanism for the origin of a crust field\nwhich does not depend on special assumptions.\n\n\fSpin and magnetism in old neutron stars\n\n9\n\nThe existence of a bottom field (with a predicted scaling \u03bc \u221d \u1e40 1/2 ) is\nalso possible if the currents sustaining the surface magnetic field of the NS\nare neutralized by the currents developed in the diamagnetic blobs of accreted\nmatter [46]. In this case the decay of \u03bc typically ends when the accretion disc\nskims the NS surface [47].\nThe first fully consistent theoretical calculations of the accretion-induceddecay of the crustal magnetic field of a NS was performed by Urpin, Geppert &\nKonenkov [48] [49] [50] [51]. The basic physical mechanism is the diffusion (ohmic\ndecay of currents) and advection of the magnetic field sustained by currents\ncirculating in the non superconducting crust. The magnetic field evolution is\ncalculated according to the induction equation:\n\u0012\n\u0013\nc2\n1\n\u2202B\n=\u2212 \u2207\u2227\n\u2207 \u2227 B + \u2207 \u2227 (v \u2227 B)\n(16)\n\u2202t\n4\u03c0\n\u03c3\nwhere B is the magnetic induction and v is the velocity of the moving fluid (= 0\nin a non accreting NS, |v| = \u1e40 /4\u03c0r2 \u03c1 for a radial approximation of the accreted\nfluid flow). In their calculation, the superconducting NS core is assumed to expel\nthe magnetic field (in the following we will refer to this boundary condition for\nthe field at the crust-core interface as BCI); the induction equation is solved for\na dipolar field and \u03c3 is given as in [52].\nAccretion affects the ohmic decay in two ways: (i) heating the crust, so reducing \u03c3; (ii) transporting matter and currents toward the core-crust boundary.\nThe relative importance of these two effects depends on other physical parameters, such as the initial depth penetrated by the currents, the impurity content\n(Q), the accretion rate, the duration of the accretion phase and the equation of\nstate of the nuclear matter. In coupling the magnetic history of the star to its\nspin evolution (through E to A), Urpin, Geppert & Konenkov [53] found that\nneutron stars born with standard magnetic moments and spin periods can evolve\nto low-field rapidly rotating objects, as illustrated in Figure 1.\nThe behavior of currents and the response of nuclear matter to an interior\nfield, at the interface between the crust and the core of a NS (typical density\n\u2243 2 \u00d7 1014 g cm\u22123 ), is still an open issue for the theorists. In view of these\nuncertainties, Konar & Bhattacharya [54] chose a different boundary condition\nat the crust-core interface for solving the equation (16). They noticed that the\ndeposition of accreted matter on top of the crust can imply the assimilation of\noriginal current-carrying crustal layers into the superconducting core of the NS.\nIn particular they assumed [54] the newly formed superconducting material to\nretain the magnetic flux in the form of Abrikosov fluxoids [15] rather than to\nexpel it through the Meissner effect (in the following this boundary condition\nwill be labeled as BCII). Within this model, accretion produces a third effect\non the evolution of \u03bc: (iii) the assimilation of material into the core, where the\nconductivity is huge, freezes the decay.\nAs illustrated in Figure 2, also this hypothesis leads to a reduction of the surface magnetic field of more than 4 orders of magnitude in 108 yr, explaining the\nlow \u03bc and its possible freezing in the millisecond pulsar population.

Magnetic, rotational and thermal evolution vs time of a 1.4 M\u2299 NS with \u03bc =\n1030 G cm3 at birth, as calculated in [53], under BCI. The adopted equation of state\nis PS (a stiff one). The initial depth of the currents is 1013 g cm\u22123 and the impurity\nparameter Q = 0.01. Phase I and II refers to E and P respectively. The value of \u1e40\nfrom the stellar wind (referred to as phase III of A) is 2/3\u00d710\u22128 \u1e40E , and the lifetime of\nthe companion star on the main sequence is 5 \u00d7 109 yr. During the disc accretion phase\n(referred to as phase IV), \u1e40 is 2/3 \u00d7 10\u22123 \u1e40E (solid line) or 2/3 \u00d7 10\u22122 \u1e40E (dotted\nline). Phase IV lasts 108 yr. The inserted panel enlarges the spin evolution during the\nvery short phase at the boundary between phase III and IV, that is when disc accretion\nsets in.\n\nBCI, it emerges that the decay of \u03bc depends not only on the total accreted mass,\nbut on the accretion rate itself. However, in this case the higher the accretion\nrate is, the stronger is the pull of crustal material into the core resulting in an\nearlier freezing of the decay. In a subsequent paper [55], it was claimed that such\na positive correlation between \u1e40 and the final value of \u03bc is supported by some\nobservational evidence [56] [57].\nOther refinements of the accretion-induced decay scenario include the effects\nof a non spherical symmetric accretion [58], the evolution of multipoles at the NS\nsurface [58], the post-accretion increase of \u03bc due to the re-diffusion of the buried\nfield towards the surface [59], and the relativistic corrections to the decaying\nhistory [60]. All together, they produce only slight changes to the aforementioned\nresults.\n\n\fSpin and magnetism in old neutron stars\n\n11\n\nFig. 2.

Equation of state \"PS\" is adopted.\n\n3.4\n\nMagnetic field evolution in binaries: spin driven scenario\n\nBoth the simple idea of the flux conservation during the gravitational collapse\nand the action of a dynamo in the convective proto-neutron star [62] lead to\nthe existence of a magnetic field penetrating the whole NS. Due to the huge\nconductivity of the core matter, no ohmic decay occurs during a Hubble time\nand so other effects have been invoked to account for the low field NSs.\nBesides magneto-dipole braking, a NS experiences a longer and more significant phase of spin-down, phase P (described in \u00a72) which enhances the effect\nof the spin-down driven scenario sketched in \u00a73.2. This is particularly important when the NS lives in a binary system. Miri & Bhattacharya [36] and Miri\n[63] explored the case of low mass systems showing that at the end of P and\nA phases the magnetic moment \u03bc has decayed, relative to its initial value \u03bc0 ,\nby a factor scaling with P0 /Pmax where P0 is the initial rotational period and\nPmax the longest period attained during the phase where P is active (P results\nfrom the interaction of the companion wind with the NS). Assuming that the\n< 103 sec, a residual magnetic moment is\nstar spins-down to P \u223c\n\u03bcfinal \u2243\n\n0.1 \u00f7 1 sec\n\u03bc0 \u2243 10\u22124 \u00f7 10\u22123 \u03bc0 \u2243 1026 \u00f7 1027 G cm3\n1000 sec\n\n(17)\n\ncompatible with the values observed for MSP population.\nRecently, Konar & Bhattacharya [64] re-examined this scenario in the case\nof accreting NSs, incorporating the microphysics of the crust and the material\nmovements due to the accretion. They concluded that the model can reproduce\nthe values of \u03bc observed in the low-mass systems only for large values of the\n\n\f12\n\nMonica Colpi et al.\n\n> 0.05 (in contrast with accretion driven decay\nunknown impurity parameter Q \u223c\n< 0.01). If the wind accretion phase is short\nmodels demanding for values of Q \u223c\nor absent, Q should even exceed unity. A more serious objection to this model\nwas risen by Konenkov & Geppert [65] who pointed out that the motion of the\nproton flux tubes in the core leads to a distortion of the field structure near the\ncrust-core interface and this in turn creates a back-reaction of the crust on the\nfluxoids expulsion: it results that (i) the sdd can be adequate for describing the\n< 1029 G cm3 ) and (ii)\n\u03bc-evolution only for weak initial magnetic moments (\u03bc0 \u223c\n\u22121\nthe predicted correlation \u03bcfinal \u221d Pmax is no more justified.\nFinally, we have to mention another class of models in which the magnetic\nevolution is strictly related with the spin history of the star: in 1991 Ruderman\n[66] [67] proposed that the coupling among P and \u03bc could take place via crustal\nplate tectonics. The rotational torques acting on the neutron star cause the\ncrustal plates to migrate, thus dragging the magnetic poles anchored in them.\nAs a consequence the effective magnetic dipole moment can strongly vary, either\nin intensity (decreasing or growing) and in direction, suggesting a tendency to\nproduce an overabundance of both orthogonal (spin axis \u22a5 magnetic axis) and\nnearly aligned rotators (spin axis k magnetic axis). Current observation of disc\npopulation MSPs seem compatible with this feature [68]. Moreover the crustcracking events could account for the glitches seen in young PSRs [69]. A more\nextended description of the variety of the spin driven decay models can be found\nfor example in [70].\n\n4\n\nEvolutionary pathways in various environment\n\nWe here describe shortly possible NS pathways driven by the changes in the field\nand in the accretion rate, over phases E, P or A, in low mass binaries and in the\nISM.\n4.1\n\nBinaries\n\nThe NSs in binaries experience a complex evolution which is tightly coupled to\nthe orbital and internal evolution of the companion star [71]. The powerful pulsar\nwind initially sweeps the stellar wind away and the NS spends its lifetime in the\nE phase. With the weakening of the electro-magnetic pressure with increasing\nperiod, an extended P phase establishes (lasting 108 \u2212 109 yr) during which the\nNS is spun down further to periods of \u223c 102 \u2212 104 seconds in its interaction\nwith the stellar wind of the companion star. When the period PP\u2192A is attained,\naccretion sets in down to the NS surface and we could possibly trace this phase\nidentifying the X-ray emission from the wind fed NS. Here the NS can accrete\nwith no exchange of angular momentum with the incoming matter unless the\nmagnetic field decreases due to either accretion induced or spin induced decay.\nThe NS can slide along the corresponding equilibrium spin-up line. As soon as\nthe donor star evolve into a giant state, it can fill its Roche lobe and matter\noverflows from the inner Lagrangian point forming an accretion disc. When a\n\n\fSpin and magnetism in old neutron stars\n\n13\n\ndisc establishes (on the viscous time scale) large accretion rates are available and\nfrom this moment on recycling starts. In the Roche lobe overflow phase (RLO)\nthe NS can be re-accelerated to millisecond periods while the field decays down\nto values of 108 \u2212 109 G. The mass transfer and orbital evolution are complex to\nmodel and it is now believed that a significant fraction of the mass lost by the\ndonor does not accrete onto the NS, but is ejected from the system [72].\n\nFig. 3. The evolutionary tracks of NSs in the plane B \u2212 P for different durations of\nthe evolution (labeled by the numbers on the right of the curves, in log10 yr) during\nphases I(E ) + II(P)+ III (A) + IV(A). The initial surface magnetic field is 3 \u00d7 1012\nG, Q = 0.03, and the other parameters as in Figure 1 [51].\n\nOnce reached the spin-up line at the current accretion rate, the NS loads\nmatter acquiring angular momentum at the rate of field decay. Recycling ceases\nwhen the donor star has evolved beyond the red giant phase and a dwarf remnant\nis left over stellar evolution, or when the binary as become detached, so that the\ndonor underfills its Roche lobe [71]. If accretion ends abruptly, the NS may\navoid phase P, transiting directly to E and possibly re-appearing as an active\nradio pulsar. In low mass binaries where the donor star is a low main sequence\nstar, evolution proceeds in a fairly ordered way: from E to P (from the stellar\nwind), to A (from wind fed accretion), to A again (from a Keplerian disc; RLO),\nas shown in Figure 3. Eventually the NS transits to E or P/E when accretion\nhalts. Observational and theoretical considerations hint for a large decay of the\nmagnetic moment \u03bc in phase A, particularly during RLO, as outlined also in\nFigures 1 and 3. The type of evolution will be applied in \u00a75 to address the\nproblem of the existence of sub-millisecond pulsars.\n\n\f14\n\n4.2\n\nMonica Colpi et al.\n\nIsolated neutron stars\n\nAt birth, isolated NSs experience phase E. The subsequent evolution depends\non the NS velocity relative to the ISM, the value of the ISM density and the\nmagnetic field intensity. The large mean kick velocities acquired at birth (hV i \u223c\n300 km s\u22121 , [20] [21][73][74]) can reduce the extent of magnetic torques in phase\nP and can impede accretion fully. It is thus possible that phase E never ends.\nThis occurs when the NS speed V is as high as V > 100 \u03bc30 n1/2 km s\u22121 : This\nspeed is derived estimating the duration of phase E at PE\u2192P (eqs. 2 and 5)\n\u03c4E\u2192P = \u03c4E (PE\u2192P ) \u223c 109 n\u22121/2 V10 \u03bc\u22121\n30 yr\n\n(18)\n\nimposing \u03c4E\u2192P \u223c 1010 yr and v \u223c V (in eq. 18, V10 , n, and \u03bc30 are the velocity,\ndensity, and magnetic moment in units of 10 km s\u22121 , 1 cm\u22123 , and 1030 G cm3 ,\nrespectively; hereon we will denote the normalizations as subscripts, for simplicity).

Whether field\ndecay enhances or reduces the probability of a transition beyond E is a subtle\nquestion that has recently been partly addressed [76][77][78][79]. Two competing\neffects come into play when B decays: (i) the spin-down rate slows down because\nof the weakening of B, causing the NS to persist longer in state E; (ii) the periods\nPE\u2192P and PP\u2192A instead decrease with B, and this acts in the opposite sense.\n\nDecay time scale, yrs\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n9\n\n10\n\n8\n\n10\n\n7\n\n10\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n10\n10\nBottom magnetic field, G\n\n10\n\n12\n\nFig. 5.

Figure 5 shows the loci where the time\nspent in phase E equals the age of the Galaxy, i.e., 10 Gyr, as a function of the\nbottom field Bbo and of the decay time-scale \u03c4\u03bc . The \"forbidden\" region lies just\nbelow each curve. As it appears from the Figure, the interval over which the NS\nnever leaves stage E is non negligible: It widens when \u03bc0 is decreased, due to\n\n\f16\n\nMonica Colpi et al.\n\nthe weakness of the magneto-dipole torque. Large as well as very low bottom\nfields do not constrain \u03c4\u03bc and permit entrance to phase A. When \u03bcbo is very\nlow, there is a turn-off of all magnetospheric effects on the inflowing matter and\nmatter accretes promptly.\nSimilarly, Colpi et al. [76] considered a model in which the spin evolution\ncauses the core field to migrate to the crust where dissipation processes drive\nohmic field decay (Sect. 3). In this circumstance, the entrance to phase A is less\nlikely if \u03c4\u03bc \u223c 108 yr, but possible otherwise. Thus, field decay can hinder the\nstars in phase E if its decay is somewhat \"fine-tuned\", while a fast decay would\ndrive them into A promptly. The strongest theoretical argument against phase\nA remains however the high kick velocity that the NSs acquire at birth (see the\nreview of Lai in this book). There remain nevertheless open the possibility that\nweak field accreting NSs exist in the Sun's vicinity.\nWe now proceed on exploring the existence of \"unusal\" NSs, the sub-MSPs\nand the X-ray isolated NSs for which these pathways are statistically relevant.\n\n5\n\nA population synthesis approach to the formation of\nsub-MSPs\n\nThis section is devoted to the statistical study of the old NSs in binaries in\nthe aim at exploring the recycling process and the possibility that ultra fastly\nspinning NSs can form in these systems. The evolutionary scheme is based on\n\u00a72, 3.3, and \u00a74.1. A similar approach is presented in \u00a76 for the isolated NSs in\nthe Galaxy.\nOn the observational side, the NS having the shortest rotational period\nPmin = 1.558 ms ever detected is PSR 1937+21. Despite its apparent smallness, Pmin is not a critical period for NS rotation: as shown by Cook, Shapiro\n& Teukolsky [80], the period Pmin is longer than the limiting period, Psh , below\nwhich the star becomes unstable to mass shedding at its equator, irrespective to\nthe adopted equation of state (EoS) for the nuclear matter. Table 1 just shows the\nvalues of Psh for a set of EoS and the corresponding values of accreted baryonic\nmass. It shows how sensitive is Psh to the EoS, indicating that its determination\nis important for our understanding of nuclear processes in dense matter.\nThe other important processes which intervene in accelerating a NS up to\nPsh are the evolution of the mass transfer rate from the low mass companion\nstar and the evolution of the NS magnetic moment \u03bc [81]. Within the recycling\nscenario [82][83] all schemes suggested for the origin and the evolution of \u03bc allow\nthe accreting NSs to reduce their \u03bc and P to the values that are characteristic of MSPs. However, due to the large volume of the parameters in the mass\ntransfer scenario and to the strong coupling between it and the field evolution\nof the NS in a low mass binary (LMB), only through a statistical approach it\nis possible to establish how efficient the recycling process is in spinning a NS to\nP < Pmin . This was recognized first by Possenti et al. [84][61], who carried on\nstatistical analyses of NSs in the millisecond and sub-millisecond range, using\na Monte Carlo population synthesis code with \u223c 3000 particles. It accounts for\n\n\fSpin and magnetism in old neutron stars\n\n17\n\nTable 1.

The table is from Cook, Shapiro &\nTeukolsky [80].\n\nthe evolution during the early phases when the NS in the LMB behaves as if\nisolated (E and P) and later when fed by wind accretion (A). The mass transfer\nduring RLO (again A) is modelled considering a range of accretion rates which\nis close to the one observed. The population synthesis code follows also the last\nradio-pulsar phase, whose duration is chosen from a flat probability distribution\nin the logarithm of time (see Table 2 for a summary of the parameters used\nin the population synthesis code). The model incorporates the detailed physics\nof the evolution of a crustal magnetic field (as discussed in \u00a73.3, using BCI and\nBCII to mimic expulsion or assimilation of the field in the NS core), and includes\nthe relativistic corrections [81] necessary to describe the spin-up process.\nEvolution is followed also beyond the RLO A phase when accretion terminates. The increasing evidence that NSs in LMBs may suffer phases of transient\naccretion (perhaps due to thermal-viscous instabilities in an irradiation dominated disc [85][86]) is suggestive that mass transfer onto a NS may not stop\nsuddenly: the star probably undergoes a progressive reduction of the mean accretion rate, modulated by phases of higher and lower accretion. This in turn\ncan start a cycle of P phases which in principle could vanish the effect of the\n\n\f18\n\nMonica Colpi et al.\nTable 2.

With the aim of exploring the effect of a decaying \u1e40 on the\npopulation of fastly spinning objects, two possibilities have been investigated: a\npersistent accretion for a time \u03c4RLO or a persistent accretion for a shorter time\nfollowed by a transient phase mimicking the quenching of the mass transfer. The\nquenching of accretion has been modelled as a power law decay for \u1e40 with index \u0393 varying from 1 \u2192 10 (the last value is representative of an almost sudden\nswitch off).\nFigure 6 collects the fractional distribution of the recycled model NSs using\nmax\nthe set of parameters reported in Table 2 with \u03c4RLO\n= 5 \u00d7 108 yr. Guided by the\nvalues of Pmin and \u03bcmin (the shortest rotational period observed in PSR 1937+21\nand the weakest magnetic moment observed in PSRJ2317+1439), the particles\nare divided in four groups. Those filling the first quadrant (P \u2265 Pmin and \u03bc \u2265\n\u03bcmin ) behave as the known MSPs. Also the objects belonging to the second\nquadrant (P < Pmin and \u03bc \u2265 \u03bcmin ) should shine as PSRs [87]. The effective\nobservability of the objects in the third quadrant (P < Pmin and \u03bc < \u03bcmin )\nas radio sources represents instead a challenge for the modern pulsar surveys.\nMost of them will be above the \"death-line\" [88], and might have a bolometric\nluminosity comparable to that of the known MSPs. Thereafter we shortly refer\nto sub-MSPs as to all objects having P < Pmin and \u03bc above the \"death-line\".\nObjects in the fourth quadrant (P \u2265 Pmin and \u03bc < \u03bcmin ) are probably radio\nquiet NSs, because they tend to be closer to the theoretical \"death-line\", and\nthey are in a period range which was already searched with good sensitivity by\nthe radio surveys.\nThe four crosses (Fig. 6) are for two representative EoSs (a very stiff EoS\nwith a break-up period 1.4 ms and a mildly soft one, with Psh \u2243 0.7 ms) and for\ntwo different boundary conditions (BCI & BCII) for the magnetic field at the\ncrust-core interface. It appears that objects with periods P < Pmin are present\n\n\fSpin and magnetism in old neutron stars\n\n19\n\nFig. 6. Distributions of the synthesized NSs, derived normalizing the sample to the\ntotal number of model stars with P < 10 ms and arbitrary value of \u03bc. The \u03bc \u2212 P plane\nis divided in four regions. As a guideline the upper left number in each cross gives the\npercentage of objects having P < Pmin and \u03bc > \u03bcmin (the typical variance is about\n1%).\n\nin a statistically significant number. In effect, a tail of potential sub-MSPs always\nemerges for any reliable choice of the parameters listed in Table 2.\nIn the synthetic sample for the mild-soft EoS, the \"barrier\" at Psh \u2243 0.7\nms is clearly visible in Figure 7 (solid lines): the mild-soft EoS gives rise to\nperiod-distributions that increase rather steeply toward values smaller than 2 ms,\nirrespective to the adopted BCs. Instead, the boundary condition affects the\ndistribution of \u03bc: BCII produces a smaller number of objects with low field.\nThus, sub-MSPs could be a tool to test the physics of magnetic field decay. 3\nEven the very stiff EoS permits periods P < Pmin , but the \"barrier\" of mass\nshedding (at Psh \u2243 1.4 ms) is so close to Pmin = 1.558 ms that only few NSs\nreach these extreme rotational rates. Moreover the period distribution for the\nstiff EoS is much flatter than that for the soft-EoS, displaying a broad maximum\nat P \u223c 3 ms. It has been recently claimed that X-ray sources in LMBs show\nrotational periods clustering in the interval 2 \u2192 4 ms [89] [90]. This effect could\nbe explained introducing a fine tuned relation between \u03bc and \u1e40 (\u03bc \u221d \u1e40 1/2\n[89]). Alternatively, gravitational wave emission has been invoked [91][92]. Here\nwe notice that such a clustering can be a natural statistical outcome of the\nrecycling process if the EoS for the nuclear matter is stiff enough.\nPhysical ingredients to describe the propeller induced spin-down of a NS at\nthe end of the RLO phase are poorly known or difficult to assess (e.g. the exact\nlaw for the decrease of the mass transfer rate or the efficiency in the extraction\nof the angular momentum from the NS to the propelled matter). In our scheme,\n3\n\nNote that a simple spin-down induced decay scenario has difficulty in explaining the\nobserved MSPs and predicts no ultra fastly spinning objects, as shown in [84].\n\n\f20\n\nMonica Colpi et al.\n\nFig. 7. Calculated distribution of millisecond NSs as a function of the spin period P\n(\u03bc is let vary over the whole range). Solid line denotes the distribution in absence of\npropeller, whilst dashed area denotes the case of a strong propeller effect. The absolute\nnumber of objects is in arbitrary units.\n\nthe largest effect occurs when phase P lasts half (\u223c 50%) of the RLO phase and\nthe power-law index is \u0393 \u223c 8. Figure 7 reports the period distributions (dashed\nareas) when such a strong propeller phase is included. We note that a strong\npropeller can threaten the formation of NSs with P < Pmin and \u03bc > \u03bcmin in the\ncase of the very stiff EoS, whilst for the mild-soft EoS the distributions preserve\na maximum just about Pmin .\nThis statistical analysis provides also information on the NS mass distribution\nas a function of P at the end of evolution. The initial NS gravitational mass,\nin the evolutionary code, was set at MG = 1.35 M\u2299 (according to the narrow\nGaussian distribution with \u03c3 = 0.04 M\u2299 resulting from measuring the mass of\nthe NSs in five relativistic NS-NS binary systems [93]). Figure 8 clearly shows\nthat the observed millisecond population should have undergone a mass load\n< 0.1M\nof \u223c\n\u2299 during recycling. This is consistent with the few estimates of the\nmasses of millisecond pulsars in low mass binaries [94] and raises the problem\nof explaining how the NS can get rid of the bulk of the mass (0.5 \u2212 1.5 M\u2299 )\nreleased by the companion during the RLO phase [72].\nFigure 8 suggests that the mass function steepens toward high values only\nwhen P falls below \u223c Pmin , approaching M \u223c 1.7 \u00f7 1.8 M\u2299 . That is a straight\nconsequence of a results already pointed out by Burderi et al. [81]: a large mass\n> 0.25M ) is required to spin a NS to ultra short periods, as\ndeposition (at least \u223c\n\u2299\nillustrated in Figure 9. The action of the propeller during the evolution has the\neffect of reducing the mass infall: the mass distribution is only slightly affected\nfor the mild-soft EoS, while for the stiff EoS the difference is more pronounced.\n\n\fSpin and magnetism in old neutron stars\n\n21\n\nFig. 8.

The different pathways (a sample is\nrepresented by the dashed lines) define a strip, which narrows towards shorter periods.\nThe strip is upper bounded by the evolutionary path for an unmagnetized NS (bold\nsolid line). The bold long dashed line refers to the evolution along the spin-up line and\nis calculated assuming a tuned torque function (which maximizes the efficiency of the\nspin-up process). The thin solid line refers to a very slow decay of \u03bc, implying larger\nmass depositions in order to attain very short spin periods.\n\n\f22\n\nMonica Colpi et al.\n\nThe wandering among the various phases can account for the interesting\nphenomenology of the MSPs observed and opens the possibility that even more\nextreme objects like the sub-MSPs exist in the Galaxy.\n\n6\n\nThe NS census in the Milky Way\n\nThe isolated NSs follow a completely different evolution pattern. Generally, over\nthe Hubble time, they cover large portion of the Milky Way and thus explore\nregions where the ISM is inhomogeneous looping among the various phases erratically.

The search of accreting isolated NSs is thus\ncompelling [102][103][104][78].\n\n10\n\n5\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n1\n\n1\n0.8\n\n10\n\n\u22121\n\n10\n\n\u22123\n\nfraction\n\nN (>S)\n\n\u22123/2\n\n\u22121\n\nPolar caps\nTotal flux\n\u221216\n\n\u221214\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n\n\u221212\n\n0\n\n\u221210\n\n0\n\n50\n100\nVelocity km/s\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\nfraction\n\nfraction\n\nlog S\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\n150\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n\n100\n\n1000\nPolar cap temperature eV\n\n0 7\n10\n\n10\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n10 10\n10\nAccretion rate g/s\n\n11\n\n10\n\n12\n\nFig. 11.

Six soft sources have been found\nin Rosat field [78], identified as isolated NSs from the optical and X-ray data.\nObservations, however, do not permit to unveil the origin of their emission, yet.\nThese sources could be powered either by accretion or by the release of internal\n\n\f24\n\nMonica Colpi et al.\n\nenergy in relatively young (\u2248 106 yr) cooling NSs 4 . Although relatively bright\n(up to \u2248 1 cts s\u22121 ), the proximity of the sources (inferred from the column\ndensity in the X-ray spectra) makes their luminosity (L \u2248 1031 erg s\u22121 ) near to\nthat expected from either a close-by cooling NS or from an accreting NS, among\nthe most luminous. Their X-ray spectrum is soft and thermal, again as predicted\nfor both Accretors and Coolers.\nCan a comparison with theoretical expectations help in discriminating among\nthe two hypothesis? First, the paucity of very soft X-ray sources in the Rosat\nfields (in comparison with earlier expectation [103][104]) is indicating that Accretors are rare objects. If these six sources are indeed accreting, this implies\nthat the average velocity of the isolated NSs population at birth has to exceed\n\u223c 200 km s\u22121 (a figure consistent with that derived from radio pulsars statistics\n[105]). In addition, since observable accretion\u2013powered isolated NSs are (intrinsically) slow objects, these results exclude the possibility that the present velocity\ndistribution of NSs is richer in low\u2013velocity objects with respect to a Maxwellian.\nThus, despite the fact that in our Galaxy there are many old NSs (about 109 ),\nthe young (\u223c 106 yr) cooling NSs seem to outnumber, at the Rosat counts, those\nin phase A. This is what emerges also from the calculation of the log N-log S distribution both of cooling and accreting stars (the last carried on with \"census\";\n[106]). At the bright counts, the local population of cooling NSs would dominate\nover the log N-log S of the dimmer and warmer (less absorbed) Accretors. There\nis the hope that Chandra and Newton will detect them, at the flux limit of 10\u221216\nerg cm\u22122 s\u22121 [106]. In support of the cooling hypothesis there is also the recent\nmeasurement[107][108] of the velocity (200 km s\u22121 ) of RXJ1856 (a member of\nthis class) indicating that this source is, most likely, not powered by accretion\nhaving a high velocity. Interestingly, the cooling hypothesis (when explored in\nthe log N-log S plane) implies that the NS birth rate in the Solar vicinity, over\nthe last 106 yr, is higher than that inferred from radiopulsar observations [106]\n[109]. This might be a crucial point as it may indicate that most of the young\nNSs may not share the observational properties of the canonical PSRs, hinting\nfor the presence of a background of \"anomalous\" young cooling NSs.\nWhat about field decay in the accretion hypothesis? Decay of the field to\nextreme low values would imply a large number of Accretors [101], not observed,\nthus excluding this possibility. This indicates that, in crustal models [28] [30],\nelectric currents need to be located deep into the crust and that the impurity\nparameter needs to be not exceedingly large [64], in spin-down induced models.\nWhat is still uncertain is whether the paucity is due mainly to a velocity effect\nthan to a \"fine-tuned\" decay, a problem not solved yet, statistically.\nWhile our theoretical expectation hints in favor of the cooling hypothesis\nthere remain yet a puzzle: the long period of one of these sources, RXJ0720\n>\n[110]. If powered by accretion, RXJ0720 would have a \"weak\" field NS (\u03bc \u223c\n1026\n3\nG cm ) and this would be a rather direct prove of some field decay, in isolated\nNSs[8][111]. Can a young cooling object have such a slow rotation? Do we have\n4\n\nsee [78] for an updated review, the description of the sources and a complete reference\nlist.\n\n\fSpin and magnetism in old neutron stars\n\n25\n\nto change or view that NSs come to birth with ultra short periods? A new\nchallenging hypothesis has been put forward [110][112] [113] that RXJ0720 is\njust the descendant of a highly magnetized NS (a Magnetar) that have suffered\na severe spin down accompanied by a nonlinear decay of the field whose energy is\npowering the X-ray luminosity [114]. This issue remains one of the new problems\nof the NS physics, making the debate on the nature of these sources an even more\nexciting problem.\n\n7\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this review we have traced the evolution of old NSs transiting through the\nEjector, Propeller and Accretor phases. The NSs of our review are far from\nbeing \"canonical\" MSPs in light binaries, or \"canonical\" PSRs in the field. The\nultra fastly spinning NSs, that we have recycled in binaries, are rather extreme\nrelativistic heavy NSs: If discovered, they will unable us to probe the stellar\ninterior in an unprecedented way, and to constrain the physics driving magnetic\nfield decay, in interacting systems. As regard to the field NSs, the discovery of the\nsix Rosat sources has just opened the possibility of unveiling \"unconventional\"\nNSs, evolving in isolation. Whether they are accreting or cooling objects is still\na mystery and even more mysterious and fascinating is their possible link with\n\"Magnetars\". The study of these \"unusual\" NSs can open new frontiers in this\nalready active field of research.\n\n8\n\nAcknowlegdments\n\nThe authors would like to thank the European Center for Theoretical Physics\nand the organizers of the conference \"Physics of Neutron Star Interiors\", D.\nBlaschke, N.K.
