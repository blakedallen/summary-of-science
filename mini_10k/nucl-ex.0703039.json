Introduction\nHigh transverse momentum particles in central Au+Au collisions are found to be\nsignificantly suppressed compared to that from p+p collisions.1,2 This is consistent\nwith the picture that high energy partons are quenched when propagating through\nthe dense medium created in central nucleus-nucleus collisions;3 and this suppression is thus a probe for the Quark Gluon Plasma. Light hadron suppression at\nRHIC has been described by a gluon radiation energy loss mechanism.4,5 Recent\nRHIC data6,7 show that the suppression of non-photonic electrons (electrons from\nheavy quark decays) has almost the same magnitude as that of light hadrons in\ncentral Au+Au collisions. This implies that heavy quarks may lose a substantial\namount of energy, which cannot be explained by current theoretical predictions\nbased on gluon radiation as the dominant mechanism for energy loss.8,9 Heavy\nquark would lose much less energy because the gluon radiation is suppressed at\nsmall angles due to the mass of heavy quarks (dead cone effect10 ). Recent calculations including both gluon radiation and collisional energy loss increase the heavy\nquark energy loss.11,24 In both scenarios electrons from charm decays are always\nmore suppressed than those from bottom. However, theoretical calculations contain\nlarge uncertainties with respect to the relative contributions to non-photonic electrons from charm and bottom quarks. Another important tool to study the Quark\nGluon Plasma properties is the angular anisotropy v2 . Observation of heavy quark\n1\n\n\fApril\n25,\nIWCF2006 \u0307XiaoyanLin\n\n2\n\n2017 10:24 WSPC/INSTRUCTION\n\nFILE\n\nXiaoyan Lin (for the STAR Collaboration)\n\nhydrodynamic flow is a unique probe for the early stage of a partonic phase.13 A\nnonzero non-photonic electron v2 has been measured for pT < 2.0 GeV/c, while\nat higher pT (although uncertainties are still large) the v2 is observed to decrease\nwith pT .14 The same D and B hadron v2 can lead to very different non-photonic\nelectron v2 due to the different decay kinematics between D and B hadrons.15\nThe quantitative understanding of the non-photonic electron suppression at high\npT and v2 requires the knowledge of the relative charm and bottom contributions\nto non-photonic electrons.\nIn this paper, correlations of non-photonic electrons with charged hadrons are\n\u221a\nstudied using the PYTHIA event generator in p+p collisions at sN N = 200 GeV.\nWe develop an innovative method which uses the azimuthal correlations between\nnon-photonic electrons and charged hadrons to estimate the relative D and B contributions to non-photonic electrons. We present the preliminary results on the\nmeasurement of azimuthal correlations between high-pT non-photonic electrons and\ncharged hadrons in p+p collisions at 200 GeV from STAR. We will use comparisons\nof the experimental results with PYTHIA simulations to estimate B and D decay\ncontributions to non-photonic electrons as a function of pT for pT > 2.5 GeV/c.\n2. PYTHIA Simulation\nWe have studied the correlations between non-photonic electrons and inclusive\n\u221a\ncharged hadrons in p+p collsions at sN N = 200 GeV from PYTHIA v6.22.16\nThe PYTHIA parameters have been tuned in order to simultaneously describe the\nSTAR measurements of the D meson pT shape17,18 and of the single non-photonic\nelectron pT distribution.6 The parameters for charm quarks are: PARP(67) = 4\n(factor multiplied to Q2 ) , < kt >= 1.5 GeV/c, mc = 1.25 GeV/c2 , Kf actor =\n3.5, MSTP(33) = 1 (inclusion of K factors), MSTP(32) = 4 (Q2 scale), CTEQ5L\nPDF and \u03b4 fragmentation function. The parameters for bottom quarks are the same\nas for charm quarks except mb = 4.8 GeV/c2 . The details of PYTHIA parameter\nsetup are discussed in Reference.19\nThe left panel of Fig. 1 shows the \u2206\u03c6 distributions between non-photonic electrons and inclusive charged hadrons with six electron trigger pT cuts and the associated hadron pT > 0.3 GeV/c. The distributions are scaled by the number of\nelectron triggers. The solid curves and dashed curves are for B decays and for D\ndecays, respectively. There is a significant difference between B and D meson decays in the near-side correlations. The width of near-side peak for electrons from\nD decays is much narrower than those for the B decays. The wide width from B\nmeson decays is due to the larger energy release (Q value) in the B meson semileptonic decays leading to a broad angular correlation between daughter hadrons\nand electrons in the laboratory frame. For an electron at high pT from B meson\ndecays, the B meson does not have to be at high transverse momentum because\nthe electron can get large momentum from the b-quark mass. In the case of D\nmeson decays, the D meson needs to have a large momentum in order to boost\n\n\fApril\n25,\nIWCF2006 \u0307XiaoyanLin\n\n2017 10:24 WSPC/INSTRUCTION\n\nFILE\n\nMeasurement of Non-Photonic Electron Angular Correlations with Charged Hadrons\n\n2.5 < P T(trig) < 3.5 GeV/c\n\n3.5 < PT (trig) < 4.5 GeV/c\n\n4.5 < PT (trig) < 5.5 GeV/c\n\n1\n\n0.25\n\n2.5 - 3.5 GeV/c\n\n0.15\n\n4.5 - 5.5 GeV/c\n\n10-1\n\n0.1\n\n0.4\n\n5.5 < P T(trig) < 6.5 GeV/c\n\n6.5 < PT (trig) < 8.5 GeV/c\n\n8.5 < PT (trig) < 10.5 GeV/c\n\n0.35\n\nNch\u2044 Ntrig\n\n3.5 - 4.5 GeV/c\n\n0.2\n\nNch\u2044 Ntrig\n\nNch\u2044 Ntrig\n\n0.3\n\n3\n\n10-2\n\n0.3\n0.25\n0.2\n0.15\n0.1\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n0.05\n\n-3 -2 -1 0\n\n\u2206\u03c6\n\n1 2 3 -3 -2 -1 0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3 -3 -2 -1 0\n\n\u2206\u03c6\n\n\u2206\u03c6\n\n1\n\n2\n\n0\n\n3\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n2\n\n8\n\n\u2211P\n\n4\n\n6\n8\n(GeV/c)\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\nT\n\nFig. 1.

Fig. 2 shows the distributions of electron pT\nversus its parent pT . We found the difference in the near-side correlations between\nD decays and B decays is largely due to the decay kinematics, not the production\ndynamics. Variations on fragmentation function from default Peterson function to\n\u03b4 function and on the parameter PARP(67) from 1 to 4 do not change the shape\nof the correlations in a significant way. This difference can help us estimate the\nrelative B and D contributions to the yields for non-photonic electrons.

STAR Data Analysis\n\nB/(B+D)\n\n\u221a\nThe data used in this analysis is p+p events at sN N = 200 GeV recorded by\nSTAR in RUN V. The main detectors utilized in this analysis are the STAR Time\nProjection Chamber (TPC)20 and the STAR Barrel Electromagnetic Calorimeter (BEMC) with the Shower Maximum Detector (SMD)21 . To obtain sufficient\nstatistics at high-pT , we used high tower triggers corresponding to an energy deposition of at least 2.6 GeV (HT1) and 3.5 GeV (HT2) in a single tower of the\nBEMC. Around 2.4 million HT1 events and 1.7 million HT2 events were used for\nthe results presented in this paper.\nElectron identification was carried out by combining ionization\n5.5 < p (trig) < 6.5 GeV/c (X 8)\nT\nenergy loss in the TPC with energy\n4.5 < p (trig) < 5.5 GeV/c (X 4)\nT\n3.5 < p (trig) < 4.5 GeV/c (X 2)\nT\ndeposition in the EMC and shower\n10\n2.5 < p (trig) < 3.5 GeV/c\nT\nprofile in the SMD.

Scale factors are used in order extrapolating the TPC tracks to\nto separate the data points well.\nthe BEMC, we require the ratio\np/E to be less than 1.5 using the\nmomentum information from the TPC, p, and the tower energy information from\nthe BEMC, E. Electrons will deposit almost all of their energy in the BEMC while\nthis is not true for hadrons. Further hadron rejection is provided by the shower maximum detector (SMD), which allows us to cut on the shower size with high spatial\nresolution. We require the profile of the electro-magnetic shower to be within the\nexpectation for electrons. Combining the power of TPC and BEMC, we can achieve\nan inclusive electron sample with purity > 98% in the pT region up to 6.5 GeV/c.\nMore detailed descriptions of the electron reconstruction techniques can be found\nin References. 6,22\nThe dominant photonic electron background is from photon conversions and\n\n\fApril\n25,\nIWCF2006 \u0307XiaoyanLin\n\n6\n\n2017 10:24 WSPC/INSTRUCTION\n\nFILE\n\nXiaoyan Lin (for the STAR Collaboration)\n60\n160\n\n55 5.5 < p (trig) < 6.5 GeV/c\nT\n50 Fit range: -1.5,1.5\n\n140 2.5 < p T(trig) < 3.5 GeV/c\n120 Fit range: -1.5,1.5\n\n45\n40\n\n\u03c72\n\n\u03c72\n\n100\n80\n\n35\n30\n\n60\n\n25\n\n40\n\n20\n\n20\n\n15\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\nB/(B+D)\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nB/(B+D)\n\nFig. 6.

We combine\nthe electron candidates with tracks passing a very loose cut on dE/dx around\nthe electron band. The invariant mass distribution of e+ e\u2212 pairs (OppSign) is\ndepicted by the grey filled area in panel (a) of Fig. 3. The OppSign contains the\ntrue photonic background as well as the combinatorial background, where nonphotonic electrons may be falsely identified as photonic electrons. The combinatorial\nbackground, which is small in p+p collisions, can be estimated by calculating the\ninvariant mass of same-sign electron pairs (SameSign) shown as red solid line in\npanel (a) of Fig. 3. A cut of mass < 0.1 GeV/c2 rejects most of photonic background.\nPanel (b) of Fig. 3 shows the ratio of inclusive electron to photonic background\nas a function of pT . The bars (boxes) on the data indicate the size of statistical\n(systematic) errors. A significant excess of electrons with respect to the background\nhas been observed, where the excess electrons are mostly from heavy quark semileptonic decays. In RUN V there was a larger amount of material producing photon\nconversions in the STAR experimental configuration. This led to inclusive electron\nto photonic background ratios from RUN V systematically lower than those from\nRUN III (IV).6\nIn order to extract the angular correlation between non-photonic electrons and\ncharged hadrons, we start with the semi-inclusive electron sample. We remove the\nOppSign sample after the mass cut from the inclusive electron sample. The remaining electrons form the \"semi-inclusive\" electron sample. The relationship of\nthese samples is: semi-inc = inc - OppSign with the mass cut = inc \u2212 (reco-pho\n+ combinatorics) = inc \u2212 (pho \u2212 not-reco-pho + combinatorics) = non-pho +\nnot-reco-pho \u2212 combinatorics. Therefore the signal can be obtained by the equation: \u2206\u03c6non\u2212pho = \u2206\u03c6semi\u2212inc \u2212\u2206\u03c6not\u2212reco\u2212pho +\u2206\u03c6combinatorics . \u2206\u03c6not\u2212reco\u2212pho\ncan be calculated using \u2206\u03c6reco\u2212pho by an efficiency correction after removing the\nphotonic partner of the reconstructed-photonic electron. The reason to remove the\nphotonic partner is that for the reconstructed-photonic electron the photonic partner is found while for not-reconstructed-photonic electron the partner is missing.\nThe resulting e-h correlations for reconstructed photonic electrons and not reconstructed photonic electrons cannot be related to each other by an efficiency correction factor alone. Therefore \u2206\u03c6not\u2212reco\u2212pho can be obtained by the equation:\n\n\fApril\n25,\nIWCF2006 \u0307XiaoyanLin\n\n2017 10:24 WSPC/INSTRUCTION\n\nFILE\n\nMeasurement of Non-Photonic Electron Angular Correlations with Charged Hadrons\n\n7\n\n\u2206\u03c6not\u2212reco\u2212pho = (1/\u03b5 \u2212 1)\u2206\u03c6reco\u2212pho\u2212no\u2212partner , where \u03b5 is the photonic electron\nreconstruction efficiency and \u2206\u03c6reco-pho-no-partner means reconstructed photonic\nelectron azimuthal correlations with charged hadrons after removing the photonic\npartners.

The fit results are consistent within statistical\nerrors when we vary the fit range in \u2206\u03c6 from \u00b11 to \u00b1\u03c0 as shown in Fig. 5. As\na cross check, we fixed the B/(B + D) ratio to see how the fit \u03c72 changes. Fig. 6\nshows the fit \u03c72 as a function of the B/(B + D) ratio with the fit range in \u2206\u03c6 from\n\u22121.5 to 1.5 for two trigger pT cuts. The \u03c72 is sensitive to the B/(B + D) ratio, and\nso is it for other trigger pT cuts and for other fit ranges. As a systematic check,\nwe allowed an overall normalization factor in the fit function to float. It gives a\nnormalization factor close to unity, and consistent B/(B + D) ratios.\nThe B semi-leptonic decay contribution to non-photonic electrons as a function\nof pT is shown in Fig. 7. The bars show the size of statistical errors. The grey\nband indicates the data uncertainties including statistical errors, and systematic\nuncertainties introduced by photonic electron reconstruction efficiency (dominant),\ndifferent fit ranges and different fit functions.

Conclusion\nIn conclusion, correlations of non-photonic electrons with charged hadrons are studied using the PYTHIA model in 200 GeV p+p collisions. The measurement of azimuthal correlations between non-photonic electrons and charged hadrons in p+p\n\u221a\ncollisions at sN N = 200 GeV from STAR has been presented. The experimental\nresults are compared with PYTHIA simulations to measure the relative B contribution to non-photonic electrons. Within the present statistical and systematic errors,\nthe preliminary data analysis based on PYTHIA model indicates at pT \u223c 4.0 \u2212 6.0\nGeV/c the measured B contribution to non-photonic electrons is comparable to\nthe D contribution and that the measured B/(B + D) ratios are consistent with\nthe FONLL theoretical calculation. Together with the observed suppression of nonphotonic electrons in central Au+Au collisions, the measured B/(B + D) ratios\nimply that the bottom quark may be suppressed in central Au+Au collisions at\nRHIC.\nThis work is partially supported by NSFC under the Grant No. 10575042, 10610285.\nReferences\n1.
