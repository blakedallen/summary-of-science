A large number of workers [2]-[28] have found evidence\nfor the sigma in models of \u03c0\u03c0 scattering even though it is partially obscured by background. Generally this state is\nconsidered to be of exotic nature (more complicated than q q\u0304) and hence an important clue to an understanding of QCD\nin its low energy non-perturbative regime. Similarly, analyses of \u03c0\u03c0 , \u03c0K and \u03c0\u03b7 scattering have provided evidence\nfor the existence of the remaining members of a possible light scalar nonet: the \u03ba, the a0 (980) and the f0 (980). In\nfact, the latter two states have been well established experimentally for some time. Of course, the treatment of such\nstrongly interacting processes is inevitably model dependent and there are a number of different opinions as to the\ncorrect approach [1]. Thus it is of great interest to see whether treatments of the role of scalars in other processes\nusing the same models employed in the scattering processes above give consistency with experiment.\nFrom this point of view we will study the role of possible light scalars in the interesting \u03b7 \u2192 3\u03c0 decay. Typically\nthis process has been treated by chiral perturbation theory [29], in which the possible effects of scalars have been\namalgamated into effective contact interactions among the pseudoscalars. This is probably the most effective way to\nstudy the \u03b7 \u2192 3\u03c0 decay. However, our goal here is to learn more about the scalars so it is natural to keep them rather\nthan integrating them out. Also there is a possibility that a light scalar [like the \u03c3(560)] might give an enhancement\ndue to closeness of its propagator to the pole [see for instance Feynman diagrams like (a) and (b) of Fig.2]. Another\nreason for including light scalars explicitly is to become more familiar with the isospin violating a0 (980) \u2212 f0 (980)\ntransition which should play a role in the \u03b7 \u2192 3\u03c0 decay and has also recently been postulated [30] to provide an\nexplanation for observations of anomalously strong a0 (980) central production and the large \u0393(\u03c6 \u2192 f0 \u03b3)/\u0393(\u03c6 \u2192 a0 \u03b3)\nratio. It is important to know whether the value consistent with the eta decay determination is consistent with these\nproposed new effects. Doubts about whether an unreasonably large value was assumed in [30] were expressed in [31].\n\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\u2021\n\u00a7\n\nEmail:\nEmail:\nEmail:\nEmail:\n\nabdou@physics.syr.edu\ndblack@jlab.org\nfariboa@sunyit.edu\nschechte@physics.syr.edu\n\n\f2\nThese doubts were confirmed [32] using the work of the present paper. Still another reason for the interest in the\neffects of the scalars in \u03b7 \u2192 3\u03c0 is to provide an orientation for the discussion of the apparently puzzling \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 3\u03c0 decays\nin which light scalar mesons can be reasonably expected to have very large effects. We will give only a preliminary\ndiscussion of this process here.\nIn section II we give a brief historical outline of treatments of \u03b7 \u2192 3\u03c0 decay based on chiral symmetry. A number\nof well known ambiguities in the analysis are briefly described.\nOur calculation is based on the tree level treatment of a chiral Lagrangian containing pseudoscalars, vectors and a\npostulated nonet of light scalars. Since the calculation is somewhat complicated, it seems to us helpful to present the\nresults in a series of steps. First, in section III we give the results of using a Lagrangian containing only pseudoscalars\nwith minimal symmetry breaking terms.\nTo this Lagrangian we add, in section IV, the scalar mesons. It will be seen that the individual scalar diagrams\nare quite large but there is a lot of cancellation so that the net effect is not at all dominant. However the scalars\ndo, as desired, increase the predicted decay rate in a noticeable way. Next, the effect of adding some derivative type\nsymmetry breakers for the pseudoscalars is described in section V. This doesn't much change the overall rate but\nmodifies the somewhat delicate cancellations so that the scalars end up making a larger percentage contribution than\nbefore. In low energy calculations of this sort one always may expect some contributions from the vector mesons.\nThis is discussed in section VI where it is shown that, although there is a new type of diagram the vectors do not\nproduce a big change in the previous results.\nSection VII contains a discussion of the results and directions for further work. For the convenience of readers,\nmaterial describing the chiral Lagrangian used is brought together in Appendix A. Similarly the detailed expression\nfor the decay amplitude is given in Appendix B.\nII.\n\nHISTORICAL BACKGROUND ON THE \u03b7 \u2192 3\u03c0 DECAY\n\nThe study of \u03b7 \u2192 3\u03c0 has turned out to be surprisingly complicated and correspondingly important for understanding\nthe non-perturbative (low energy) structure of QCD. Chiral dynamics in various forms has been the basic tool. Since\nthe process violates G-parity it was initially assumed to be of electromagnetic nature, mediated by an effective photon\nexchange operator proportional to the product of two electromagnetic currents. The old \"current algebra\" approach\nhad previously predicted the KL \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 spectrum shape [33] to be\n1\u2212\n\n2E0\n,\nm\n\n(1)\n\nwhere m is the KL mass and E0 the energy of the \u03c0 0 in the KL rest frame. This shape, which is in reasonable\nagreement with experiment, resulted from the vanishing commutator of the axial charge transforming like a \u03c0 + with\nthe appropriate product of two weak currents. When Sutherland [34] repeated this type of calculation for \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0\nwith the product of two electromagnetic currents he found that the decay amplitude was actually zero (to this leading\norder). Thus the \u03b7 \u2192 3\u03c0 decay did not seem to be mediated by a virtual photon emission and reabsorption. In fact,\nit was found [35] that a quark scalar density operator with the \u2206I = 1 property proportional to\n \u0304\n\u016bu \u2212 dd\n\n(2)\n\nwould give a non-zero result for the decay rate. A more detailed treatment [36] showed that the quark density operator\ngave the same spectrum for \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 as in Eq.(1) with m the \u03b7 mass in this case. Such a result is in fairly good\nagreement with experiment. The scalar density interaction in Eq.(2) was recognized [37] to be the fundamental\nup-down quark mass difference generated by the Higgs boson in the electroweak theory.\nHowever, the predicted rates of the \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 \u2192 3\u03c0 0 modes (both the ratios and the absolute values)\ndid not agree well with experiment at that time. Some years later, after more precise experiments, the ratio of the\nrates for \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 to 3\u03c0 0 modes stabilized around the value expected from isospin invariance. On the other hand the\nabsolute rate has only recently stabilized to a value notably larger than that predicted by theory. The theory behind\nthe current algebra results could be economically presented in the framework of an effective chiral Lagrangian. For\nmost low energy processes where the scheme could be expected to work, the tree level computation did produce results\nwithin 25 % or so of experiment. Thus the relatively poor prediction for \u03b7 \u2192 3\u03c0 at tree level is somewhat surprising.\nAn improvement was obtained by Gasser and Leutwyler [29] who carried the computation of the chiral Lagrangian\namplitude to one loop level. Since the non-linear chiral Lagrangian is non-renormalizable, this required the addition\nof new counterterms. Their finite parts were new parameters which could be mostly determined from other processes.\nThey obtained the result \u0001\u0393(\u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 ) = 160 \u00b1 50 eV which may be compared with the present experimental\nvalue [38] \u0393 \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 expt = 267 \u00b1 25 eV. The extra effects included involve both the implicitly integrated-out\n\n\f3\nheavier meson exchanges and partial unitarization to one loop order. One might expect a two loop calculation in\nthe chiral perturbation scheme to be valuable but this may involve too many unknown parameters at the present\nstage. A dispersion\napproach using the Gasser-Leutwyler result as a subtraction gave an improved estimate [39]\n\u0001\n\u0393 \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 = 209 \u00b1 20 eV, which still seems too small.\nA possible source of ambiguity arises from the determination of the coefficient of the driving scalar density interaction\nin Eq.(2). This is determined from the K 0 \u2212 K + mass difference, which in turn has two components\nm2 (K 0 ) \u2212 m2 (K + ) =\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0002 2 0\n\u0003\nm (K ) \u2212 m2 (K + ) quark mass + m2 (K 0 ) \u2212 m2 (K + ) \u03b3 ,\n\n(3)\n\ncorresponding to the quark mass differences and the virtual photon emission and reabsorption diagrams respectively.\nThe latter is given in the chiral limit by m2 (\u03c0 0 ) \u2212 m2 (\u03c0 + ) according to Dashen's theorem [40] and the reasonable\nassumption that the photon contribution saturates the pion mass difference. A number of authors [41] have argued\nthat there are important corrections to Dashen's theorem which have the effect of boosting the \u03b7 \u2192 3\u03c0 decay rate.\nIf one questions Dashen's theorem it is natural to also question Sutherland's result, which deals with the direct\nelectromagnetic contribution to \u03b7 \u2192 3\u03c0 . An investigation of this point yielded [42] the estimate that there was only\nabout a 2% change arising from this, although it decreased rather than raised the rate.\nStill another point which may repay further investigation concerns the possible subtleties arising from \u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7 \u2032 mixing.\nAn understanding of the \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 3\u03c0 process, for example, might clarify this point. This process has been treated by\nsome authors [43], [44] in the literature but has received only a fraction of the attention given to \u03b7 \u2192 3\u03c0 .\nIn the present paper we will focus on learning more about the putative nonet of light scalar mesons by studying\ntheir contribution to \u03b7 \u2192 3\u03c0.\nIII.\n\nCHIRAL SYMMETRY RESULTS TO LOWEST ORDER\n\nFor comparison, we first present the well-known results when only the terms present in the lowest order chiral\nLagrangian of pseudoscalars are kept.\n\nLLO\n\n\u0001\u0003\n\u0001\n\u0002\nF\u03c0 2\n\u03ba 2\n=\nTr \u2202\u03bc U \u2202\u03bc U \u2020 + \u03b4 \u2032 Tr M U + U \u2020 +\nln\n8\n576\n\n\u0012\n\ndetU\ndetU \u2020\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere the last term [see Eq.(A14) and comments there] supplies mass to the SU(3) singlet state and M is defined in\n(A11). Fitting LLO to the experimental masses determines \u03b4 \u2032 = F\u03c02 m2\u03c0 /8.\nThe \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 amplitude receives, in this approximation, contributions from diagrams (a), (b) and (c) of Fig.1,\nwhich are given in Eq.(B1) (with the non leading corrections deleted). To a reasonable approximation which displays\nthe key dependences these sum up to the lowest order result for the \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 amplitude\nM0+\u2212 (E1 , E2 , E3 ) \u2248\n\n16i\u03b4 \u2032 y\n2E1\ncos\u03b8p (1 \u2212\n).\n4\nF\u03c0\nm\u03b7\n\n(5)\n\nHere E1 is the \u03c0 0 energy in the \u03b7 restframe and y is the dimensionless parameter in Eq.(A11) which measures the\nisospin violation in the quark mass matrix. Assuming Dashen's theorem, Eq.(4) yields\n8\u03b4 \u2032 y = F\u03c02 (m2K 0 \u2212 m2K + \u2212 m2\u03c00 + m2\u03c0+ ),\n\n(6)\n\nwhich allows us to solve for y. Furthermore \u03b8p is the \"nonstrange-strange\" pseudoscalar mixing angle defined in\nEq.(A15); it is generally taken to be about 37o . It is related to the \"octet-singlet\" angle, \u03b8 by\n\u221a\ncos\u03b8 \u2212 2sin\u03b8\n\u221a\ncos\u03b8p =\n.\n(7)\n3\n\u221a\nThen Eq.(5) agrees with Eq. (1.14) of [29] except that they neglected \u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7 \u2032 mixing by replacing cos\u03b8p \u2192 1/ 3 in\nwhat was denoted the current algebra formula. The matrix element for \u03b7 \u2192 3\u03c0 0 is given in general by\nM000 = M0+\u2212 (E1 , E2 , E3 ) + M0+\u2212 (E2 , E1 , E3 ) + M0+\u2212 (E3 , E2 , E1 ).\n\n(8)\n\n\f4\nThe widths are then, defining \u03930+\u2212 = \u0393(\u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 ) and \u0393000 = \u0393(\u03b7 \u2192 3\u03c0 0 ):\nZ\n1\n2\ndE1 dE2 |M0+\u2212 | ,\n\u03930+\u2212 =\n64\u03c0 3 m\u03b7\nZ\n1\n\u0393000 =\ndE1 dE2 |M000 |2 .\n384\u03c0 3 m\u03b7\n\n(9)\n\nUsing LLO , with parameters determined as described above, we get the tree-level results [from the first terms in\na,b,c\neach of Mcontact\nin Eqs.(B1)]:\n\u03930+\u2212 = 106 eV,\n\u0393000\n= 1.40.\n\u03930+\u2212\n\n(10)\n\nThese may be compared with the experimental results [38]\n(\u03930+\u2212 )expt = 267 \u00b1 25 eV,\n(\n\n\u0393000\n)\n= 1.40 \u00b1 0.01,\n\u03930+\u2212 expt\n\n(11)\n\nwhich demonstrate the disagreement with experiment for the overall rates in the simplest model. However the width\nratio has about the correct magnitude. The related energy spectrum is also about the correct magnitude. The squared\nmatrix element is usually described by quantities a, b and c defined from\n2\n\n\u221a\n3\nm\u03b7 \u22123m\u03c0 (E2\n\n|M0+\u2212 | \u221d (1 + aY + bY 2 + cX 2 . . .),\n\n(12)\n\n3\n\u2212 E3 ) and Y = m\u03b7 \u22123m\n(E1 \u2212 m\u03c0 ) \u2212 1. In the present paper we shall not take into account the\nwith X =\n\u03c0\n0\n+\n(not completely negligible) kinematic \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 mass difference. See [29] for a discussion of this point. The predictions\nfrom this simple model, a \u2248 \u22121 and b \u2248 0.25 are similar to the experimental results [45] aexp = \u22121.19 \u00b1 0.07 and\nbexp = 0.19 \u00b1 0.11 with c=0.\nIt is of some interest to also give the predictions for the \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 3\u03c0 decay process at tree level using the simple\nLagrangian Eq.(4). It just is necessary (see Appendix B) to replace cos\u03b8p by sin\u03b8p and m\u03b7 by m\u03b7\u2032 in Eq.(5) to get\nfor the \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 matrix element:\n\u2032\n(E1 , E2 , E3 ) \u2248\nM0+\u2212\n\n16i\u03b4 \u2032 y\n2E1\n).\nsin\u03b8p (1 \u2212\nF\u03c04\nm\u03b7 \u2032\n\n(13)\n\nThis leads to the predictions for the \u03b7 \u2032 modes:\n\u0393\u20320+\u2212 = 497 eV,\n\u0393\u2032000 = 562 eV.\n\n(14)\n\nThe experimental results are given as [38]\n(\u0393\u20320+\u2212 )exp\n< 104 eV,\n(\u0393\u2032000 )exp = 315 \u00b1 56 eV.\n\n(15)\n\nOnly the 3\u03c0 0 mode has really been measured; its width is smaller than predicted in the simple model just presented.\nOne would, of course, expect better agreement for the low energy process \u03b7 \u2192 3\u03c0 for which chiral perturbation theory\nshould be more clearly reliable. In the present paper we shall just make a few remarks on this more complicated\nprocess.\nIt may also be worthwhile to give a rough estimate of the corrections to the rates corresponding to violations of\nDashen's Theorem mentioned earlier. If we parameterize the electromagnetic contribution to the K + \u2212 K 0 mass\ndifference as\n(m2K 0 \u2212 m2K + )\u03b3 = f (m2\u03c00 \u2212 m2\u03c0+ ),\n\n(16)\n\nwhere f = 1 corresponds to Dashen's Theorem, we would find by using Eq.(3) that the \u03b7, \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 3\u03c0 rates predicted for\nLLO should be multiplied by\n\u00152\n\u0014 2\n(mK 0 \u2212 m2K + ) \u2212 f (m2\u03c00 \u2212 m2\u03c0+ )\n.\n(17)\n(m2K 0 \u2212 m2K + ) \u2212 (m2\u03c00 \u2212 m2\u03c0+ )\n\n\f5\nFor f \u2248 2, which was actually found many years ago [46] the correction factor is about 1.54 and would give \u03930+\u2212 \u2248 163\neV.

N is assumed\nto contain the well-established f0 (980) isoscalar and the a0 (980) isovector as well as the \u03c3(560) and the strange \u03ba(900).\nOf these only the \u03ba(900) will not contribute to \u03b7 \u2192 3\u03c0 at tree level. The quark structure of such a nonet has been\nthe subject of much discussion [1]-[28]. If this were an ideal nonet like \u03c1 \u2212 \u03c9 \u2212 K \u2217 \u2212 \u03c6 one would expect the roughly\ndegenerate a0 (980) and f0 (980) to be lowest rather than highest in mass. Actually the masses are better understood\nintuitively [47] if Nab is an \"ideal dual nonet\" constructed as Qa Q\u0304b with Qa \u223c \u01ebabc q\u0304 b q\u0304 c ; qa being the ordinary quark.\nThen the observed inverted mass ordering is easily seen to follow just from counting the number of strange quarks in\nNba . It is important to note that the form of the couplings of Nab to the particles of the non-linear chiral Lagrangian\n\n\f6\n\n\u03b7\n\n.\n\n\u03c0\n\n0\n\n+\n\u2212\n\u03c0\n\u2212\n+\n\u03c1\n\n\u03c0\n\u2212\n\u03c0+\n\n\u03b7\n\n\u2212\n\u03c1+\n\n\u03c0\n\n\u2212\n+\n\n0\n\n\u03c0\n\n\u03c00\n(a)\n\n+\n\u2212\n\n(b)\n\nFIG. 3: Feynman diagrams representing the \u03c1 meson contributions to the decay \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 .\n\nbeing used depend only on the flavor transformation properties of Nab . This does not distinguish different quark\nsubstructures. What is sensitive to the quark substructure is the scalar mixing angle, \u03b8s , defined from\n!\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\nN33\n\u03c3\ncos\u03b8s \u2212sin\u03b8s\n1\n2\n.\n(18)\n=\nN1 +N2\n\u221a\nf0\nsin\u03b8s cos\u03b8s\n2\n\n\u03c0\n2\n\nSmall values of \u03b8s would typify a dual ideal nonet while |\u03b8s | about\nwould typify a conventional nonet. Fitting\nthe \u03c0\u03c0 and \u03c0K scattering amplitudes, including the effects of these scalar resonances, selects [16] the small value\n\u03b8s = \u221220.3o.\nThe scalar nonet mass terms in Appendix A are specified by the four parameters (a, b, c, d). The needed chiral\ninvariant scalar -pseudoscalar-pseudoscalar S\u03c6\u03c6-type couplings are specified by the parameters (A, B, C, D) and the\nmixing angle \u03b8s . These were all determined from fitting to \u03c0\u03c0 scattering, \u03c0K scattering and the strong decay \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0\u03c0.\nActually there is reason to believe [48] that the scalars may be best understood as mixtures of a lighter dual nonet\nand a heavier ordinary nonet. From that point of view, which will be explored more fully in the future, the present\nsingle nonet, Nba should be regarded as an approximation to the situation where the heavier (after mixing) particles\nhave been integrated out.\nThe Feynman diagrams for the scalar contributions to \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 are shown in Fig.2. Notice that the diagram\nin (d) involves new a0 \u2212 \u03c3 and a0 \u2212 f0 isospin violating transitions rather than the \u03c0 0 \u2212 \u03b7 and \u03c0 0 \u2212 \u03b7 \u2032 transitions\nwhich play an important role in the other diagrams. Their strengths Aa\u03c3 and Aaf (see Appendix B) were determined\nsimply by including the effects of isospin violation contained in the spurion matrix M in the b and d scalar mass\nterms. Therefore, this does not introduce any new parameters. Actually, the possibility of such contributions was\nsuggested a long time ago [43] as a possible solution of the \u03b7 \u2192 3\u03c0 width problem. Recently a relatively large a0 \u2212 f0\nmixing has been suggested [30] as a way of understanding both anomalously large a0 central production and the large\n\u0393(\u03c6 \u2192 f0 \u03b3)/\u0393(\u03c6 \u2192 a0 \u03b3) ratio. However criticisms of this explanation have also been presented [31]. Clearly it may\nbe useful for studies of processes other than \u03b7 \u2192 3\u03c0 to give the coefficients of the scalar isospin violating two point\nLagrangian,\nL = Aa\u03c3 a00 \u03c3 + Aaf a00 f0 ,\n\n(19)\n\ndetermined consistently with the \u03b7 \u2192 3\u03c0 calculation. Using the parameters from Eq.(A21) in Eq.(B4) we find\nu \u2212md\nAa\u03c3 = 0.0170y GeV2 , Aaf = 0.0234y GeV2 , where y is the quark mass ratio m\nmu +md . Notice that y (which is\nnegative) is an overall factor for the \u03b7 \u2192 3\u03c0 amplitude in the present model.\nWe would like to discuss the effects of the scalars when added to the more realistic Lagrangian presented in Appendix\nA which contains both pseudoscalars and vectors. This Lagrangian contains additional symmetry breaking terms (\u03b1p\nand \u03bb\u2032 ) to account for the ratio of pseudoscalar decay constants, FK /F\u03c0 being different from unity as well as a number\nof terms describing the properties of the vector mesons. Of course, the vector mesons play an important role in low\nenergy processes. Since there are many terms it seems useful to add these new features one at a time. Thus in the\npresent section we will consider just the minimal pseudoscalar Lagrangian, LLO [Eq.(4)], to be present in addition to\nthe scalars. Furthermore, it is instructive to look at the contributions to the amplitude from different diagrams in\norder to see how they combine to give the predicted total \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 width. In section III we reviewed the leading\norder calculation of the \u03b7 \u2192 3\u03c0 amplitude which gives the result \u0393(\u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 ) = 106 eV in the Dashen's theorem\nlimit. In Fig.4 we show how the individual contributions of the diagrams in Fig.1 combine to give the leading order\namplitude. The magnitude of the \u03b7 \u2212 \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 \u2032 \u2212 \u03c0 0 transition coefficiencts [Eq.(B4) with \u03b1p = \u03bb\u2032 = 0, so independent\nof which state is on-shell] are (in GeV2 ):\nC\u03c0\u03b7 \u2248 0.0042,\n\nC\u03c0\u03b7\u2032 \u2248 0.0031.\n\n(20)\n\n\f7\n\u22120.05\n\n0.1\n\n0.05\nc\nPS\n\n\u22120.1\n\n0\n\n\u22120.05\n\nb\nPS\n\n\u22120.15\n\nal\n\ntot\nPS\n\n\u22120.1\n\u22120.2\n\u22120.15\n\n\u22120.2\n0.137\n\na\nPS\n\n0.157\n\n0.177\n\n0.197\n\nE1 GeV\n\n0.217\n\n\u22120.25\n0.137\n\n0.157\n\n0.177\n\n0.197\n\n0.217\n\nE1 GeV\n\nFIG. 4: Plot of different contributions to the leading order \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 amplitude as a function of the energy of the neutral\npion. On the left, the solid line corresponds to the direct four-point isospin-violating \u03b7\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 vertex of Fig.1a. The energydependent dotted line is due to an \u03b7\u03c0 0 transition followed by a four-pion contact vertex (Fig.1b). The dashed line is the small\ncontribution due to Fig.1c. (with both \u03b7 and \u03b7 \u2032 included in the final line). On the right we show the total leading order\namplitude, which is the sum of Figs.1a\u20131c.\n\nThree of the twelve scalar diagrams in Fig.2 can be seen to be larger (by at least an order of magnitude) than all\nthe rest. These are the three diagrams involving the lightest of the scalar mesons, \u03c3, and are contained in Figs.2a, 2b\nand 2d. For the case of Fig.2b the graph with an \u03b7 \u2212 \u03c0 0 transition dominates that with an \u03b7 \u2032 transition because the\nlatter is suppressed by the (square of) the \u03b7 \u2032 mass in the denominator of the propagator and also the smallness of the\nassociated coupling constants/transition coefficients. In Fig.5 we present the \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 amplitudes arising from the\nthree diagrams just mentioned and notice that they cancel almost completely. In particular the \u03c3 exchange diagrams\nin Figs.2a and 2b have opposite signs, as expected \u2013 their structure is roughly similar except the propagators have a\nrelative minus sign. We note also that the new isospin violating diagram, involving an a0 \u2212 \u03c3 transition, turns out not\nto lead to dramatically larger contributions than the other diagrams. The cancellation between different diagrams\ninvolving the sigma means that the total scalar contribution to the \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 width is smaller than might be\nexpected and in fact arises mainly from the a\u00b1\n0 exchanges in Fig.2c. Comparing Fig.5b with Fig.4b shows that the net\nscalar contribution does enhance the overall \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 rate. Specifically, including the scalar contributions with\nthe pseudoscalar Lagrangian LLO has increased \u03930+\u2212 by 16 per cent, from 106 eV to 124 eV. The ratio \u0393000 /\u03930+\u2212\nis essentially unchanged.\nActually, the calculations above have neglected the finite widths of the \u03c3, f0 and a0 particles. We take these into\naccount by making the replacements in the corresponding propagators [see Eq.(B2)]:\n\nm2X\n\n1\n1\n\u2192 2\n,\n2\n2\n+q\nmX + q \u2212 imX \u0393X\n\n(21)\n\nwhere X stands for \u03c3, f0 or a0 . The \u0393X are given in Appendix A. These replacements modify the result to \u03930+\u2212 = 120\neV, a 13 per cent increase relative to the leading order result. The width effect is mainly due to the \u03c3 propagator.\nWe may note that the improvement due to the scalars is consistent with the lower values of the prediction, 160 \u00b1 50\neV obtained from the next order of chiral perturbation theory in ref.[29]. The numerical amount of suppression of\nthe scalar contribution to the decay rate from cancellation of Figs. (a) and (b) of Fig.2 is due to the fitted values of\n\u03b3\u03c3\u03c0\u03c0 and \u03b3\u03c3\u03b7\u03b7 given in Eq.(A22). If we wanted to raise the predicted rate to about 150 eV (still keeping Dashen's\ntheorem in the evaluation of y) it would be necessary to raise \u03b3\u03c3\u03b7\u03b7 to about 10.\nV.\n\nEFFECTS OF HIGHER ORDER PSEUDOSCALAR SYMMETRY BREAKERS\n\nSo far we have worked only with the leading order chiral Lagrangian of pseudoscalars and scalars and obtained (to\nmd \u2212mu\nlinear order in y = \u2212 m\n) isospin-breaking amplitudes proportional to \u03b4 \u2032 , b and d in Eq. (A13) of Appendix A.\nd +mu\nIn order to better fit the properties of the pseudoscalar mesons we consider, as mentioned above, the higher-order\nsymmetry breaking terms in Eq.(A13) with coefficients \u03b1p and \u03bb\u2032 .

On the right we show the total amplitude due to the scalar mesons alone. The solid line is due to all of the\ndiagrams in Fig.2 (for the sample value E2 = m\u03c0 ) and the dashed line is the sum of the three largest amplitudes plotted on\nthe left and discussed in the text.\n\nNext we examine the effects of these two new symmetry breaking terms on our previous calculation. It will be seen\nthat these effects include an interesting redistribution of the contributions from the scalar and pseudoscalar diagrams\nto the total amplitude. First, the contact diagram Fig.1a will receive corrections due to the \u03b1p and \u03bb\u2032 terms [see\nEq.(B1)]. This results in some energy dependence since \u03b1p gives a four-point derivative coupling. More importantly,\nthe \u03b7 \u2212 \u03c0 0 and \u03b7 \u2032 \u2212 \u03c0 0 transition coefficients relevant for \u03b7 \u2192 3\u03c0 now depend on which particle is on-shell and are\nnumerically (in GeV2 ):\n\u03b7\n\u03c0\nC\u03c0\u03b7\n\u2248 \u22120.00583y,\nC\u03c0\u03b7\n\u2248 \u22120.0151y\n\u03c0\nC\u03c0\u03b7\u2032 \u2248 \u22120.0113y.\n\n\u03b7\nC\u03c0\u03b7\n\n(22)\n\nSince\nis now considerably suppressed in magnitude, the Feynman amplitude for Fig.1b is now suppressed, while\n\u03c0\nC\u03c0\u03b7\nand the amplitude for Fig.1c remain about the same. These results, due to only pseudoscalars, are summarized\nin Fig.6 which may be compared with Fig.4. The net result is that the total \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 amplitude (shown in the\nsecond of Fig.6) due to pseudoscalar mesons is reduced compared with the leading order result.

Compare with the first of Figs.4. Right: Total amplitude due to pseudoscalar mesons alone, taking into\naccount \u03b1p and \u03bb\u2032 terms (compare with second of Figs.4).\n\nHowever, for the diagrams involving scalar mesons the effect of higher order symmetry breaking is even more\nimportant. As we noted above, the scalar meson contribution to \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 was rather small as the main diagrams\n\n\f9\ntended to cancel. When we include the \u03b1p and \u03bb\u2032 corrections to the \u03b7\u03c0 0 transition this cancellation will not be so\ncomplete. Specifically, comparing Eqs.(20) and (22) we see that the magnitude of the amplitude for Fig.2a, where the\n\u03b7 \u2212 \u03c0 0 transition occurs with an on-shell \u03b7, will be reduced by a factor of approximately four, while that of Fig.2b,\nwhere the \u03b7 \u2212 \u03c0 0 transition has an on-shell pion, will remain about the same relative to our result in Section IV. Fig.2d\nwill be unchanged. There will now be a non-negligible contribution from the scalar mesons. It will be more negative\nin sign (the contribution from Fig.2a is positive, but now smaller in magnitude) and will add \"constructively\" to the\npseudoscalar diagrams in Fig.1 and so increase our prediction for \u0393(\u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ). This is shown in Fig. 7. Adding\nall of the pseudoscalar and scalar diagrams in Fig.1 and Fig.2 with the inclusion of the symmetry breaking effects due\nto \u03b1p and \u03bb\u2032 we get: \u0393(\u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ) = 119.6 eV. This is essentially the same as the result in section IV but now a\nlarger portion is due to the scalar meson diagrams. Since this is the case the damping effect of the sigma width will\nbe more prominent; in fact it reduces the predicted rate to 103.6 eV in the Dashen's theorem limit.\n0\n\n0.03\n\nscalars contribution\nSa\n\n\u22120.1\n\n0.01\n\n\u22120.01\n\n\u22120.03\n\n\u22120.05\n0.137\n\nSd\n\n\u22120.2\n\nSb\n\n\u22120.3\n\n0.157\n\n0.177\n\n0.197\n\nE1 GeV\n\n0.217\n\n\u22120.4\n0.137\n\ntotal\n\n0.157\n\ne\n\nlitud\n\namp\n\n0.177\n\n0.197\n\n0.217\n\nE1 GeV\n\nFIG. 7: Left: Contributions due to the three largest scalar meson diagrams, taking into account higher order symmetry breaking\neffects encoded in \u03b1p and \u03bb\u2032 .

Dashen's theorem is assumed in order to extract y.\n\nVI.\n\nINCLUDING VECTORS IN THE CALCULATION\n\nIt is well known that the inclusion of vector mesons is important for a realistic discussion of low energy chiral\ndynamics. For example, in the chiral pertubation scheme, most of the finite pieces of the counterterms can be\nexplained by integrating out various vector contributions [49]. In our present approach, of course, we are keeping the\nresonances, rather than integrating them out, in order to learn more about the scalars.\nFirst, the vector mesons contribute to the \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 amplitude corresponding to Fig.3a, which is just a correction\nto \u03c0\u03c0 scattering. Its value given by the amplitude, M\u03c1a in (B3) is easily seen to be comparatively large. However\nthe fourth term of the U (3)L \u00d7 U (3)R invariant Lagrangian Eq.(A10) gives, in addition to the \u03c1\u03c0\u03c0 vertex a four pion\na\ncontact term [included in Mcontact\nin (B1)]. Actually this contact term cancels most of the contribution from the\n\n\f10\n\u03c1-exchange diagram in Fig.3a. This is well known from chiral treatments of \u03c0\u03c0 scattering: when the \u03c1 is added to\nthe Lagrangian, chiral symmetry requires a contact term which cancels most of the \u03c1 contribution near threshold,\nthereby maintaining the current algebra threshold result.\nHowever, the situation is actually a bit more complicated since the process of obtaining an adequate fit to the\nproperties of both the vectors and pseudoscalars [50] requires a number of additional symmetry breaking terms\nshown in Eq.(A13) of Appendix A. As well as the symmetry breaking terms we have already discussed involving the\npseudoscalars alone, there are, in particular, two new terms, measured by the coefficients \u03b1+ and \u03b1\u2212 . It turns out\nthat their effects are very minor. They include an additional contribution to the 4-point isospin violating \u03b7\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0\nvertex due to the \u03b1\u2212 term, corrections to the 4-pion vertex in Fig.1b due to both \u03b1+ and \u03b1\u2212 and an additional\ndiagram, shown in Fig.3b, which contains a new G-parity (and isospin) violating \u03c1\u03c0\u03b7 vertex [the amplitude for this\nis given as M\u03c1b in (B3)]. Note that there there exists a \u03c10 \u2212 \u03c9 mixing transition, which is the analog of the \u03c0 0 \u2212 \u03b7 and\na00 \u2212 f0 mixing transitions, but it does not contribute to \u03b7 \u2192 3\u03c0 at tree level.\nThe decay widths with inclusion of vectors are tabulated in Table II for the same values of x, y used in the last\nsection. In this table the neutral modes are also included. Furthermore, the effect of both the scalar and (actually\nnegligible) vector widths are included too. We see that, as expected from our discussion above, the vectors do not\nchange the overall predictions compared to the last column of Table I very much but they do give a little enhancement.\nThis is also clear by comparing the pseudoscalars + vectors column of table II with the pseudoscalars only column of\nTable I. It is seen again that the scalars make a non negligible contribution to the total amplitude.\nx, y\n\ndecay mode ps. +vec. ps.+sc.+vec.(no width) ps. +sc. + vec.

Our\nmotivation was primarily to learn more about the scalars themselves. The framework is a conventional non-linear\nchiral Lagrangian of pseudoscalars and vectors, extended to include scalars (the Lagrangian is described in Appendix\nA). The parameters involving the scalars were previously obtained to fit the s-wave \u03c0\u03c0 and \u03c0K scattering in the\n\n\f11\nregion up to about 1 GeV as well as the strong decay \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 \u03b7\u03c0\u03c0. An initial concern is whether the model as it\nstands, containing essentially no undetermined main parameters (up to possible uncertainties in the quark mass\nratios x = 2ms /(mu + md ) and y = (mu \u2212 md )/(mu + md )), does not make the \u03b7 \u2192 3\u03c0 amplitude too large.\nIn particular, the \u03c3(560) exchange diagrams (a) and (b) of Fig.2 might lead to a great deal of enhancement due\nto the possibility of the \u03c3(560)'s momentum being close to mass shell. However this turns out not to be the case.\nIn our initial calculation where the scalars are added to the minimal model of pseudoscalars given in Eq.(4), the left\npart of Fig.5 shows that these two diagrams, though not individually small, tend to cancel each other. This partial\ncancellation occurs because the \u03b7 \u2212 \u03c0 0 transition leads to opposite signs when the \u03b7 is on mass shell and when the \u03c0 0\nis on mass shell (In the first case we have a \u03c0 0 propagator carrying the momentum squared of an on-shell \u03b7 while in\nthe second case, the reverse holds). In addition, the enhancement due to the sigma propagator is further suppressed\nby the inclusion of an imaginary piece, needed to satisfy unitarity in the scattering calculation. The net result is that\nthe effect of including scalars in the minimal pseudoscalar Lagrangian, Eq.(4) is to increase the width for \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0\ndecay by about 13 per cent. This relatively small, due to cancellation, increase illustrates the difficulty of finding\ndramatic \"smoking gun\" evidence for the existence of a light sigma. In the scattering calculation a light sigma appears\n(see for example [13]) obscured by a large background and does not have a simple Breit Wigner shape.\nIt is amusing to note the effect of higher derivative terms in the Lagrangian of pseudoscalars (see section V for\ndetails). The higher derivative terms allow one to conveniently implement at tree level the fact that the ratio of\nthe pseudoscalar decay constants FKp /F\u03c0p is somewhat greater than unity. With these terms the important \u03c0 0 \u03b7\ntransition vertex has a momentum dependent piece. Together with a needed modification in the parameter fitting\n(see section 4 of Appendix A) this reduces the contribution of the pseudoscalars to the \u03b7 \u2192 3\u03c0 decay width. However\nthe modification of the \u03c0 0 \u2212 \u03b7 transition noticeably upsets the cancellation between the two sigma exchange diagrams\nin (a) and (b) of Fig.2. The net result is that, while the total prediction for the \u03b7 \u2192 3\u03c0 decay width remains about\nthe same, now about thirty percent of the value is contributed by the scalars.\nThe vector meson contribution, discussed in section VI, actually does not change things much. This is because\nthe \u03c1 exchange diagrams for \u03c0\u03c0 s-wave scattering are essentially canceled at very low energies by an extra four pion\ncontact term which automatically arises due to the chiral symmetric formulation. Experimentalists fit the Dalitz plot\ndescribing the \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 spectrum to the form given in Eq.(12). A fit of this type to the predicted spectrum\nfrom the Lagrangian of pseudoscalars, scalars and vectors was seen to be close to the experimental one. The basic\nspectrum shape is already reasonable with the very simplest model discussed in section III. As both the theory and\nexperiment get more precise, the importance of the spectrum shape toward a deeper understanding of the underlying\nphysics increases.\nA particularly interesting scalar contribution to \u03b7 \u2192 3\u03c0 arises from the a0 \u2212 \u03c3 transition shown in (d) of Fig.2\n(The a0 \u2212 f0 transition contribution to \u03b7 \u2192 3\u03c0 is suppressed due to the propagator of the heavier f0 (980)). This\nis the analog of the important \u03c0 0 \u2212 \u03b7 transition and, in a sense, is a new mechanism for \u03b7 \u2192 3\u03c0 (although it was\ninvestigated a long time ago [43] as a possible way to increase the \u03b7 \u2192 3\u03c0 width). The formula in raw form for this\ntransition is given in Eq.(B4). We evaluated its strength from the knowledge of the isospin violating piece of the\ndimensionless quark mass matrix M in Eq.(A11), determined from the pseudoscalar sector and the coefficients: a, b, c\nand d of the scalar meson mass terms [see Eqs.(A10] and (A13)) determined from the isospin conserving sector of the\nscalars. However as one can see from the left sides of Figs.5 and 7, the contribution to \u03b7 \u2192 3\u03c0 due to the a0 \u2212 \u03c3\ntransition is not very large, although it has the right sign to boost the decay rate.\nThe method just described also evaluates the strength of the a0 (980) \u2212 f0 (980) transition. For convenience this\nis given after Eq.(19), where the overall factor, y is displayed. This transition has been very much \"in the news\"\nrecently as a proposed [30] explanation for the large observed \u0393(\u03c6 \u2192 f0 \u03b3)/\u0393(\u03c6 \u2192 a0 \u03b3) ratio and the anomalously\nstrong a0 central production. However criticisms of this explanation have been given [31], [32], pointing out that\nthe a0 \u2212 f0 mixing expected from a transition strength like the one determined above is insufficient to give a large\neffect. Intuitively, because of the near degeneracy of the a0 (980) and f0 (980) as well as the similarity of their widths,\none might expect the mixing to be very large. But the mixing amplitude is governed by a dimensionless factor\niAaf /(ma \u0393a ) [see for example Eq.(12) of [32]] which is suppressed by the scalar meson width, \u0393a .\nIn section II we discussed the current comparison between theory and experiment for the \u03b7 \u2192 \u03c0 0 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 width. The\nexperimental width [38] is \u03930+\u2212 = 267 \u00b1 25 eV. This may be compared with the one loop chiral perturbation theory\nresult [29] of 160 \u00b1 50 eV. More recent attempts [39] to estimate final state interaction effect outside of the chiral\nperturbation theory approach have increased this somewhat to 209 \u00b1 20 eV. It seems to us that the thirty per cent\ncontribution of the scalars compared to the pseudoscalars we have found should probably not be considered on top of\nthis latter figure. That is because a good portion of the increase due to scalars we have found may be considered as\nresulting from final state interactions. Many attempts to close the gap between theory and experiment have focused\n[41] on a reanalysis of electromagnetic corrections to the K + \u2212 K 0 mass difference. This is argued to increase the\nquark mass ratio, y which is an overall factor for the \u03b7 \u2192 3\u03c0 amplitude.\nFrom the standpoint of learning more about the properties of the scalar mesons it is clear that the \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 3\u03c0\n\n\f12\ndecays represent a potentially important source of information. In this case there is sufficient energy available for\nthe a0 (980) and f0 (980) propagators to be close enough to their mass shells to avoid suppressing the contributions of\nthese resonances. On the other hand, the theoretical analysis is more difficult since large non-perturbative unitarity\ncorrections are expected. In addition, other more massive particles may also contribute. The experimental information\n[see Eq.(15)] is more preliminary than in the \u03b7 \u2192 3\u03c0 case. While a number with reasonably small errors has been\npresented for \u0393\u2032000 , there is only a weak upper bound for \u0393\u2032+\u22120 and also no information on its Dalitz plot. In the\nmodel employed in the present papper the \u03b7 \u2032 \u2192 3\u03c0 amplitudes are simply obtained from the \u03b7 \u2192 3\u03c0 amplitudes by\nthe simple substitution given in Eq.(B5). Notice that this substitution rule would get modified if a more complicated\n\u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7 \u2032 mixing scheme [e.g. the one mentioned after Eq.(A15)] is adopted. As shown in Eq.(14) the prediction of the\nminimal model of only pseudoscalars is somewhat too high, but at least of the correct order of magnitude. Adding the\nscalars without any readjustment of parameters does not improve the prediction for \u0393\u2032000 but makes it considerably\nlarger (about 2300 eV). A similar large value was recently found in [44]. Since the phase space is fairly large it is\nperhaps to be expected that large values are typically obtained. Presumably it is a sign for including more detailed\nunitarity corrections or other physical effects which result in cancellations. We are particularly hopeful that a careful\nstudy of mixing between a lower mass exotic scalar nonet and a more conventional higher mass scalar nonet [26, 28, 48]\nmay solve this problem and perhaps contribute to an improved understanding of the \u03b7 \u2192 3\u03c0 decays also.\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe are grateful to Masayasu Harada, Paula Herrera-Siklody and Francesco Sannino for very helpful discussions\nrelated to this problem.

The pseudoscalar nonet \u03c6(x) is a 3 \u00d7 3 matrix which fits into the\nunitary chiral matrix\nU = exp(\n\n2i\u03c6(x)\n)\nF\u03c0\n\n(A2)\n\nwhere F\u03c0 is the (bare) pion decay constant. Under a chiral transformation\nU \u2192 UL U UR\u2020 .\n\n(A3)\n\nIt is convenient to define the 3 \u00d7 3 unitary matrix \u03be by U = \u03be 2 . Then \u03be transforms as\n\u03be \u2192 UL \u03beK \u2020 (\u03c6, x) = K(\u03c6, x)\u03beUR\u2020 ,\n\n(A4)\n\nwhich implicitly defines the unitary matrix K. The intuitive significance of K is that the objects Kq behave like bare\nquarks surrounded by a pseudoscalar meson cloud, or \"constituent quarks\". The objects\nv\u03bc p\u03bc =\n\ni\n(\u03be\u2202\u03bc \u03be \u2020 \u00b1 \u03be \u2020 \u2202\u03bc \u03be),\n2\n\n(A5)\n\n\f13\ntransform as\np\u03bc \u2192 Kp\u03bc K \u2020\n\nv\u03bc \u2192 Kv\u03bc K \u2020 + iK\u2202\u03bc K \u2020 .\n\n(A6)\n\nA putative scalar nonet matrix N (x) is taken to transform as\nN \u2192 KN K \u2020 ,\n\n(A7)\n\ni\n\u03c1\u03bc \u2192 K\u03c1\u03bc K \u2020 + K\u2202\u03bc K \u2020 ,\ng\u0303\n\n(A8)\n\nThe vector meson nonet \u03c1\u03bc transforms as\n\nwhere we have included the dimensionless coupling constant, g\u0303.

These include the parameters m2v , a, c, A, B, C and D. Note that the pseudoscalars\nare still massless at this level. Further note that for the interactions and mass terms of the scalars we do not restrict\nourselves to a single trace. For q q\u0304 mesons the single trace is suggested by the OZI rule while for an ideal dual nonet the\nA term is in fact expected to be dominant. We made a fit for m2v , a, c, A, B, C and D assuming only SU(3) invariance.\n3.\n\nSymmetry Breaking Terms\n\nd)\nThe fundamental QCD Lagrangian contains the quark mass term \u2212 (mu +m\nq\u0304Mq, with the dimensionless matrix\n2\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n1+y\n0\n0\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\nM=\uf8f0 0 1\u2212y 0 \uf8fb\n(A11)\n0\n0 x\n\nmd \u2212mu\ns\nwhere x = mu2m\n+md and y = \u2212 md +mu .\nIt is convenient to define\n\n\u0001\n1\n\u03beM\u03be \u00b1 \u03be \u2020 M\u03be \u2020 .\n2\nLagrangian is taken as\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0003\n2\n\u03b4 \u2032 Tr M(U + U \u2020 ) + \u03bb\u2032 Tr MU \u2020 MU \u2020 + MU MU\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0011\nv\u03bc\nv\u03bc\n2\u03b1p \u0010\n\u03c1\n\u2212\nM\u0302\np\np\n\u03c1\n\u2212\n+\n2\u03b1\nTr\nTr\nM\u0302\n\u03bc\n+ \u03bc \u03bc\n\u03bc\n+\n+\ng\u0303 2\ng\u0303\ng\u0303\n\u0015\u0013\n\u0014\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2\u03b1\u2212\nv\u03bc\n, p\u03bc\nM\u0302\u2212 \u03c1\u03bc \u2212\nTr\ng\u0303\ni\nh\n2\u03b3 \u2032 Tr M\u0302+ F\u03bc\u03bd (\u03c1)F\u03bc\u03bd (\u03c1)\nM\u0302\u00b1 =\n\n(A12)\n\n\u2212 bTr(N N M) \u2212 dTr(N )Tr(N M).\n\n(A13)\n\nThen, the symmetry breaking\nLSB =\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+\n\n\f14\n2\n\nOnly the parameters \u03b4 \u2032 , \u03bb\u2032 , \u03b1p , b and d here contribute to the isospin violating vertices of interest in the present\npaper. The parameter \u03b3 \u2032 was included in the overall parameter fit obtained in [50] but its small effect on the isospinconserving vertices will be neglected.\nIn addition to the quark mass induced symmetry breaking terms there is an important term induced by instanton\neffects which breaks just the U (1)A piece of SU(3)L \u00d7 SU(3)R \u00d7 U(1)V \u00d7 U(1)A . It may be summarized as\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03ba 2 detU\n\u2032\nL\u03b7 =\n+ ...\n(A14)\nln\n576\ndetU \u2020\nwhere \u03ba is a constant essentially proportional to the squared mass of the \u03b7 \u2032 meson. The three dots stand for other\nterms which will be neglected here but are listed in Eq. (2.12) of [51]. Effectively this term gives an important\ncontribution to the \u03b7 \u2032 mass and an \u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7 \u2032 mixing angle defined by\n!\n!\n\u221a !\n(\u03c611 + \u03c622 )/ 2\n\u03b7\ncos\u03b8p \u2212sin\u03b8p\n.\n(A15)\n=\n\u03c633\nsin\u03b8p cos\u03b8p\n\u03b7\u2032\nWhen the extra terms in Eq. A14 are included they will not only give rise to an additional isospin violating transition\nbut will also modify the \u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7 \u2032 mixing transformation above to be the non-orthogonal one given in Eq. (4.9) of [51].\nWe will not include these effects in the present paper, however.\n4.\n\nNumerical values of parameters used\n\nFor the averaged pseudoscalar masses we used,\nm\u03c0 = 0.137 GeV,\n\nmK = 0.4957 GeV.\n\n(A16)\n\nIn section III we gave the fitted parameters for the lowest order Lagrangian containing only pseudoscalars. This\nalso yields the isospin conserving quark mass ratio x = 25.1 (assuming that f , defined in Eq. (16) is unity). A\nrefitting of these parameters is necessary when the \u03b1p /g\u0303 2 and \u03bb\u20322 symmetry breaking terms are included. This can\nbe conveniently done following the method used in preparing Table III of [50]. There, a value of x is assumed and\nthe four quantities F\u03c0 (unrenormalized pion decay constant), \u03b4 \u2032 , |\u03bb\u2032 |2 and \u03b1p /g\u0303 2 are calculated in terms of the four\nphysical quantities m\u03c0 , mK , F\u03c0p = 0.1307 GeV and FKp = 0.1598 GeV, using:\n2\n2\nm2K /8\n(1 + x)F\u03c0p\nm2\u03c0 /16 \u2212 FKp\n,\n1 \u2212 x2\n2\n\u03b4 \u2032 = F\u03c0p\nm2\u03c0 /8 \u2212 4\u03bb\u20322 ,\n\n\u03bb\u20322 =\n\n\u03b1p\n2\ng\u0303 F\u03c02\n\nF\u03c0\n\u03b1p\ng\u0303 2\n\n(FKp /F\u03c0p )2 \u2212 1\n,\n2(1 + x) \u2212 4(FKp /F\u03c0p )2\nF\u03c0p\n,\n=\n(1 + 4\u03b1p /(g\u0303 2 F\u03c02 ))1/2\n\u03b1p\n= F\u03c02 ( 2 2 ).\ng\u0303 F\u03c0\n=\n\n(A17)\n\nIn addition, the isospin violating quark mass ratio y is obtained from\n2\n(m2K 0 \u2212 m2K + ) \u2212 f (m2\u03c00 \u2212 m2\u03c0+ ) = (4y/FKp\n)(\u22122\u03b4 \u2032 \u2212 8(1 + x)\u03bb\u20322 + m2K \u03b1p /g\u0303 2 ),\n\n(A18)\n\nfor a particular value of f . To isolate the effects of the scalars we may choose an x such that, with the value f = 1\ncorresponding to Dashen theorem, we recover the value y = \u22120.277 found in sections III and IV.
