A clear Fe emission line and a strong soft excess are present in the source\nspectra. We fit the spectra with a relativistic reflection model and find the model tends to fit\nthe data with a high iron abundance possibly due to the large soft excess present. By checking\nthe difference and the RMS spectra, we find there is likely an absorption edge at \u223c 0.89\nkeV, which might be caused by oxygen or neon. We also produced an analysis of the timeresolved spectra in order to examine the existence of the edge. Although high iron abundance\nis required more in the time-resolved spectra, a model of solar iron abundance together with\nan absorption edge gives a more physical explanation. Variation of the ionisation parameter is\nan alternative, plausible explanation for the excess seen in the difference spectra. It is difficult\nto know if there are warm absorbers in this source from the current data. To further investigate\nthe presence of possible warm absorbers, higher signal-to-noise low-energy data are needed.\nThe work presented here tentatively suggests that the spectra of a BLS1 can be explained by\na relativistic reflection model similar to that often seen in their narrow-line cousins.\nKey words: accretion,\n\n1 INTRODUCTION\nBroad-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (BLS1s) are a subclass of Active\nGalactic Nuclei (AGN) with broad permitted optical emission lines\n(H\u03b2 FWHM > 3000 km s\u22121 ). Unlike narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s; H\u03b2 FWHM < 2000 km s\u22121 ), the broad-line region\n(BLR) of a BLS1 is of high velocity and close to the central black\nhole. Studies of Boller et al. (1996) concluded that high-velocity\nand steep soft X-ray continuum slopes are not found in nature in\nAGN population. The steep, ultrasoft X-ray spectra in NLS1s are\ngenerally believed to be because of a relatively low-mass black hole\nwith a very high accretion rate (Pounds et al. 1995) or distant BLR\nclouds (Puchnarewicz et al. 1992).\nCBS 126 (= Ton 1187, \u03b12000 = 10h 13m 03.2s, \u03b42000 =\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n+35\u25e6 51 24 , z = 0.079) is a broad line Seyfert 1 galaxy with H\u03b2 =\n2980 \u00b1 200 km s\u22121 (Grupe et al. 2004). It was detected as a bright\nX-ray AGN during the ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS, Voges et al.\n1999) in 1990 November (Grupe et al. 1998a) and was observed\nagain by ROSAT with the High Resolution Imager in 1995 October\n(Grupe et al. 2001). Our attention was drawn to CBS 126 because\nit shows a relatively high degree of optical continuum polarisation.\n\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail: cychiang@ast.cam.ac.uk\n\nc 2012 RAS\n\nGrupe et al. (1998b) measured a degree of polarisation 1.26\u00b10.13\nper cent, which is quite unusual for a soft X-ray selected AGN. The\npresence of optical polarisation suggests that part of the direct view\nis absorbed/reddened. Brandt et al. (1997) suggested and found that\nsoft X-ray selected, highly polarised AGN show warm, ionised absorber in X-rays. CBS 126 is therefore a good candidate for finding\nionised X-ray absorber features. It was again observed in X-rays as\npart of a Swift fill-in project to study the spectral energy distributions of AGN (Grupe et al. 2010) in 2006 June. The source shows\nsimilar properties to NLS1s such as strong spectral variability (see\nFig. 1) and a large soft excess below \u223c 1 keV, which are typical for\nNLS1s but unusual for BLS1s. CBS 126 harbours a black hole with\nan estimated mass in excess of \u223c 7.6 \u00d7 107 M\u2299 (Shen et al. 2011,\nSDSS DR7 catalogue). This, together with the high-velocity BLR\nclouds and the enormous soft excess make CBS 126 an interesting\nsource.\nA soft excess below \u223c 1 keV is commonly seen in X-ray\nspectra of AGNs. It can be fitted phenomenologically by a blackbody with a temperature of \u223c 0.1 - 0.2 keV, but the temperature\nof the component is fairly constant between sources, and is probably not related to the luminosity or black hole mass of the source\n(Gierli\u0144ski & Done 2004). Instead, it is likely to have an atomic origin. Since the disc model predicts that the disc temperature should\n\n\f2\n\nC.-Y. Chiang et al.\nTable 1. Summary of the Suzaku observations of CBS 126.

For instance, those models would expect the soft X-rays to vary in a similar manner to\nthe hard X-rays, i.e. the variety would be broadband in X-rays,\nwhich is not the case with CBS 126. On the other hand, the spectral\nand temporal behaviour of this source can be well explained with\nionised relativistic reflection models (Miniutti & Fabian 2004). In\nthis picture the relativistic reflection component, including the soft\nX-ray excess, dominates during dimmer states, and thus give rise to\nthe observed steep soft X-ray spectra. In contrast, during brighter\nstates, the reflection component is diluted and the flatter powerlaw\ndominates. The focus of this paper is to test whether our new simultaneous Suzaku/Swift data further support the relativistic reflection\nmodel for CBS 126. Other possibilities will not be probed in depth.\n\n2 DATA REDUCTION\nbe correlated with the black hole mass, the soft excess is less likely\nto be due to the thermal emission from the accretion disc, except\nfor objects with low black hole masses and high Eddington ratios such as NLS1s. Gierli\u0144ski & Done (2004, 2006) suggested that\nsoft excess can be caused by relativistically smeared and partially\nionised absorption, but in this scenario an extreme outflow velocity\nis needed to produce a smooth spectrum (Schurch & Done 2007).\nDone et al. (2012) claimed that if the inner disc emission emerges\nas a Comptonisation component rather than a blackbody spectrum,\nthe Wien tail of this component could produce the soft excess.\nJin et al. (2012) showed that the model could explain the spectra\nof a sample of unobscured type 1 AGNs. This scenario requires an\nelectron population with a relatively low temperature and high optical depth, and the Compton upscattering component to arise in the\ntransition region between the disc and the corona. It again requires\nan unexplained, fairly constant temperature between sources.\nAn alternative physical interpretation to explain the broadband X-ray spectrum is the relativistic reflection model.\nCrummy et al. (2006) investigated a large sample of type 1 AGNs\nand found the relativistically blurred reflection can reproduce the\nsoft excess. The soft excess here is a series of blurred emission\nlines caused by disc reflection and other emission (Ross & Fabian\n2005). The constancy of the shapes is then due to atomic physics.\nOne of the major goals in observing CBS 126 with Suzaku and\nSwift simultaneously, was to clarify the nature of its unusual, variable, optically polarised spectrum as found from earlier Swift observations. Fig. 1 exhibits correlated variability in the optical/UV\nand X-ray bands. Most importantly, the earlier Swift data already\nshowed that the variability in the X-ray band itself takes place\nmostly at higher energies, while at the lower X-ray energies there\nwas no significant variability. Furthermore, earlier Swift data exhibited steep soft X-ray spectra during dimmer states while flatter\nspectra during higher states. Standard accretion disc-corona mod-\n\n2.1 Suzaku\nCBS 126 was observed by Suzaku on 2010 October 18 for a total\nof \u223c100 ks of good exposure time (see Table 1). The X-ray Imaging Spectrometer (XIS) was operated in the normal mode. All the\ndetectors (XIS0, XIS1 and XIS3) were operated in both 3 \u00d7 3 and\n5 \u00d7 5 editing modes. We reduced the data with the HEASOFT V6.10\nsoftware package following the Suzaku Data Reduction Guide. We\nused a circle with a 180 arcsec diameter to extract the source spectrum. The background spectrum was extracted using the same size\nof circular region from a position free from the source, the calibration source and any other clear cosmic source. Response files\nwere produced by the script XISRESP, which calls XISRMFGEN\nand XISSIMARFGEN automatically. Spectra and response files of\nthe two front-illuminated (FI) CCD XIS detectors (XIS0 and XIS3)\nwere combined using the script addascaspec in FTOOL, resulting in a total 2 - 10 keV flux of which is 4.12 \u00d710\u221212 ergs cm\u22122\ns\u22121 . The XIS 0.5-10.0 keV light curve of CBS 126 is shown in\nthe upper panel in Fig. 2. It is clear that the XIS light curve is\nvariable. We also produced the difference spectrum by subtracting\nthe low-flux state spectrum from the high-flux state spectrum. The\nXIS light curve was divided into two flux intervals, both having a\nsimilar number of counts. The slice above the average count rate\n(1.25 ct/s for XIS FI and 2.00 ct/s for XIS BI) forms the high-flux\nstate spectrum, while the slice below the average represents the low\nflux spectrum. The total 0.5 - 2 keV fluxes are 4.57 \u00d710\u221212 ergs\ncm\u22122 s\u22121 and 4.49 \u00d710\u221212 ergs cm\u22122 s\u22121 for XIS FI and backilluminated (BI, that is, XIS1) spectra, respectively.\nThe Hard X-ray Detector (HXD) was operated in XISnominal pointing mode. The background spectrum of HXD/PIN\nconsists of a non-X-ray background and a cosmic X-ray background. We obtained the non-X-ray background event file from a\ndatabase of background observations made by the PIN diode.

Since the background dominates the PIN spectrum, we\nproduced the earth-occulted background for a further check. Ideally the earth-occulted background should be identical to the nonX-ray background. The counts of the earth-occulted background\n(0.358 \u00b1 0.004 counts s\u22121 ) are however slightly higher (\u223c 15\npercent) than that of the non-X-ray background (0.298 \u00b1 0.001\ncounts s\u22121 ), which means the PIN data were mildly over-estimated.\nThe navy blue points in Fig. 3 is the total background including\nthe earth-occulted background and the cosmic background, and\nthe cyan points slightly below stand for the PIN spectrum before\nbackground correction. It can be seen that if we replace the non-Xray background with the earth-occulted background, we effectively\nhave a non-detection in the PIN band. The green points in Fig. 3\nare the background-corrected PIN data when using the non-X-ray\nbackground. Since the data show no solid detection in PIN, we do\nnot include the PIN spectrum in all our spectral fittings. The light\ncurve plotted in the lower panel of Fig. 2 also shows the source is\nfaint in the PIN energy band, thus we did not generate a difference\nspectrum for PIN either.\n2.2 Swift\nThe Swift Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) explorer mission\n(Gehrels et al. 2004) observed CBS 126 13 times.

The PIN spectrum\nis shown in green and the Swift XRT spectrum is shown in blue. The navy,\nblue and cyan data are explained in detail in section 2.1. A strong soft excess at low energies and iron line structure can be clearly seen. The lower\npanel shows the data/model ratio of the difference spectra (see definition in\nsection 2.1) with the same powerlaw model applied. The BI XIS difference\nspectrum above 1.7 keV and the FI XIS above 10 keV are ignored due to\npoor signal-to-noise.\n\nWe use Swift data taken simultaneously with the above Suzaku\nobservation. The Swift X-Ray Telescope (XRT; Burrows et al.\n2005) was operating in photon counting mode (PC mode; Hill et al.\n2004) and the data were reduced by the task xrtpipeline version\n0.10.4, which is included in the HEASOFT package 6.1. Source\n\u2032\u2032\nphotons were selected in a circular region with a radius of 70\nand background region of a close by source-free region with\n\u2032\u2032\nr = 200 . The background region is much larger than the source\nregion in order to get enough counts to model the background\nspectrum. Photons were selected with grades 0\u201312. The photons\nwere extracted with XSELECT version 2.4. The spectral data were\nre-binned by using grppha version 3.0.0 having 20 photons\nper bin. The spectra were analysed with XSPEC version 12.3.1\n(Arnaud 1996) between 0.3 and 5 keV. The ancillary response\nfunction files (arfs) were created by xrtmkarf and corrected for\nvignetting and bad columns/pixels using the exposure maps. The\nstandard response matrices swxpc0to12s0 20010101v011.rmf and\nswxpc0to12s6 20010101v011.rmf were used for the observations\nbefore and after the XRT substrate voltage change in 2007 August,\nrespectively (Godet et al. 2009). The difference spectrum was not\ngenerated because the exposure time (\u223c 6 ks) is too short.\nOne of the advantages of Swift is that data are taken simul-\n\n\f4\n\nC.-Y.

Therefore, data were\nalso taken with the UV/Optical Telescope (UVOT; Roming et al.\n(2005)) using 6 photometry filters. Before analysing the data, the\nexposures of each segment were co-added by the UVOT task uvo\u2032\u2032\ntimsum. Source counts were selected with the standard 5 radius\nin all filters (Poole et al. 2008) and background counts in a source\u2032\u2032\nfree region with a radius r=20 . The data were analysed with the\nUVOT software tool uvotsource assuming a GRB like power law\ncontinuum spectrum. The magnitudes as listed in Table 2 were\nall corrected for Galactic reddening EB\u2212V = 0.011 given by\nSchlegel et al. (1998). The correction factor in each filter was calculated with equation (2) in Roming et al. (2009) who used the\nstandard reddening correction curves by Cardelli et al. (1989).\n\n3 DATA ANALYSIS\nWe fit a powerlaw modified with Galactic absorption across the 0.94 keV and 7.5-10 keV energy ranges, and the results are shown in\nFig. 3.

The equivalent width (EW) of the line is 114+35\n\u221236 eV.\n\nSwift XRT spectrum, and an iron emission line in the FI XIS spectrum can be clearly seen. We also fit the modified powerlaw model\nto the Suzaku difference spectra (see the lower panel of Fig. 3).\nThe difference spectra are quite noisy due to lack of data. A simple\npowerlaw fits the difference spectra above 1 keV, and there are no\nfeatures around the iron line band as expected if the features are\ndue to constant, additive component such as an emission line. Despite poor signal-to-noise in the difference spectrum, soft excesses\nare still present, similar to that seen in the real spectra. This hints at\nthe possibility of either a further distinct varying component acting\npreferentially in the low-energy band or the presence of a multiplicative component, as the latter is not removed in the difference\nspectra even if it does not change with time.\nIn the frame work of an extra component acting preferentially\nat low energies, the large soft excess could be due to a possible\nComptonised Wien tail from the disc component. We investigate\nthe possibility of this scenario by fitting the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the UV and soft X-ray data of CBS 126 with\na Comptonisation model. The UV data have been fitted with a\nlow-temperature blackbody disc component (DISKBB, Mitsuda et al.\n1984). Two Comptonisation components (COMPTT, Titarchuk 1994)\nhave been included to explain the soft excess and the powerlawshape spectrum at high energies. As shown in Fig. 4, the Comptonised Wien tail can reproduce the shape of the soft excess. If\nthe component which produces the soft excess varies with the hard\nc 2012 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201310\n\n\fModelling CBS 126\n\n-\n\n0.89 \u00b1 0.01\n0.35+0.02\n\u22120.03\n\n-\n\n0.88+0.02\n\u22120.01\n0.39+0.05\n\u22120.04\n\nindex\nRin (Rg )\ni\n\n7.2+0.8\n\u22121.3\n3.0+0.6\n\u22120.4\n\u25e6\n27+20\n\u22126\n\n> 5.4\n1.7+0.6\n\u22120.1\n\u25e6\n51+3\n\u221214\n\n4.2+0.3\n\u22120.1\n< 2.2\n< 19 \u25e6\n\n5.8 \u00b1 2.1\n1.7+0.5\n\u22120.2\n\u25e6\n51+11\n\u221216\n\nAFe\n\u03be\nNiref (10\u22127 )\nNnref (10\u22126 )\n\n> 9.0\n200+12\n\u221223\n2.5+0.6\n\u22121.2\n8.9+2.6\n\u22122.5\n\n(1.0)\n119+33\n\u221228\n6.2+3.4\n\u22120.9\n10.7+3.8\n\u22124.1\n\n> 9.5\n(1.0)\nSee Table 4\nSee Table 4\n8.7 \u00b1 2.3\n11.0+5.1\n\u22124.8\n\n1642/1476\n\n1632/1475\n\n1148/1067\n\n\u03c72 /d.o.f.\n\n0.10\n\n2.00+0.02\n2.11+0.03\n\u22120.03\n\u22120.02\nSee Table 4\n\n1181/1066\n\n0.05\n\n0.00\n0.3\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n2\nEnergy (keV)\n\n5\n\n10\n\nFigure 6.

As stated in the introduction, the purpose of the work\nis to test if the relativistic reflection model can explain the overall\nshape of the X-ray continuum of the new Suzaku observation. In\nwhat follows, we explore this possibility further, though it may not\nbe the only explanation of the data as the Compton hump has not\nbeen detected by Suzaku PIN.\n\n3.1 Time-averaged Spectra\nWe start by fitting the data with the simplest model that can explain\nthe broad iron line in a physically consistent manner as well as the\nsoft excess. The model consists of a reflection continuum model\nREFLIONX (Ross & Fabian 2005) convolved by the KDBLUR model.\nWe also model the neutral reflection with REFLIONX by setting the\nionisation parameter \u03be = 1.0. The Galactic absorption is modelled\nby TBnew using Wilms (Wilms et al. 2000) abundance. The model\n(hereafter Model A) and the fitting parameters are summarised in\nTable 3.\nIt is found that the iron abundance AFe tends to be higher than\n9 times of the solar value, which is not expected. If we set the iron\nabundance to be the same as the solar value, the \u03c72 /d.o.f. of the\nfitting increases to 2014/1477 and the model failed to reproduce\nthe soft excesses below 0.9 keV. A blackbody component possibly\narising from a low-temperature accretion disc was then considered,\neven though we do not expect the disc emission to change within\nsuch a short period of time and thus should not give rise to the soft\nexcess seen in the difference spectrum. To examine whether the\ndisc emission is present in the X-ray band and contributes variability, we generated the root mean square (RMS) spectrum using the\nc 2012 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201310\n\n0.3\n1.1\n1\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n\n0\n\nTime (ks)\n\nTime (ks)\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\n180\n\nTime (ks)\n\nFigure 7.

In the lower\npanel these were normalized by dividing the difference between the count\nrate in each 10 ks bin and the mean count rate by the standard deviation.\nSee section 3.2 for detail.\n\ntechnique developed by Edelson et al. (2002). The RMS spectrum\nof CBS126 (see Fig. 6) is flat, and the variability of each energy\nband lies on a similar level. This implies that not a particular energy band contributes significantly more variability than the other\nenergy bands. Furthermore, when adding a DISKBB component to\nthe spectra, an effective temperature Teff of \u223c 50 eV is required to\nexplain the soft excess, which is way too high for a M \u223c 108 M\u2299\nblack hole (typical value Teff \u223c 10 eV for black holes of this mass).\nTherefore, the possibility of a blackbody component can be ruled\nout and either the source has a highly supersolar iron abundance or\nthere is a further component contributing to the soft excess which\nmust also be present in the difference spectrum.\nIn order to test the possibility that the soft excess in the difference spectrum is due to a combination of reflection at solar abundances and a further multiplicative component, we added an absorption edge using ZEDGE to Model A and froze the iron abundance at solar. This model is hereafter referred to as Model B\n(Table 3). This resulted in a fit with similar quality (\u03c72 /d.o.f. =\n\n\f6\n\nC.-Y. Chiang et al.\nzedge\n\nTable 4.

The top\ntwo panels of Fig. 7 shows the \"soft\" (0.3-1.0 keV) and the \"hard\"\n(1.0-10.0 keV) light curves, respectively. The blue line in the lower\npanel shows the colour (the soft/hard ratio) evolution of the observation. When we look at the top two panels of Fig. 7, the count rates\nof the soft and the hard light curves appear to vary with each other.\nHowever, looking at the normalised colour evolution (soft/hard),\nit appears that there could in fact be at least four distinct periods\nwhich are highlighted by the vertical lines in Fig. 7. As such, we\nproceed by dividing the observation into these different segments\nand created a new set of time-resolved spectra. The observation was\ndivided into the segments as follows: 0-40 ks (period 1), 40-90 ks\n(period 2), 90-140 ks (period 3) and 140-190 ks (period 4). The resulting Suzaku FI XIS spectra are noisy in the low-energy band (of\nparticular interest to us since we are looking for the soft excess),\ntherefore only the Suzaku low-energy BI XIS spectra were used.\nThe Swift XRT spectrum has an exposure time much less than 40\nks and is not suitable for time-resolving analysis envisioned here.\nWe fit each time-resolved spectrum with both models A and\nB. The iron abundance, inclination, neutral hydrogen density, emissivity index, edge energy and inner radius are treated as global parameters and are tied between the periods (i.e., they are assumed\nto be constant at these time scales). The normalisation of the powerlaw and ionised reflection component, as well as the ionisation\nparameter of the inner disc, on the other hand, are free to vary. The\nnormalisation of the neutral reflection component is also free to\nvary, but tied between the periods. Table 3 also summarises the results for the global parameters in the time-resolved data and Table 4\nshows the evolution of the remaining parameters. Fig. 8 displays the\ndata/model ratio of for Model B, with the different periods shown\nin separate panels for clarity. It can be seen that that this model fits\nthe spectra of each periods well, with no evidence for a soft excess.\nThe energy of the absorption edge is found to be \u223c 0.88 keV, which\nis consistent with that obtained by the time-averaged spectra.\n\n5\n\n10\n\nFigure 8.

The ionisation parameter is\ndefined as \u03be = Lion /nR2 , where Lion is the ionising luminosity,\nn is the hydrogen number density, and R is the distance to the ionising source. \u03be is proportional to the ionising luminosity, which in\nthis case is coming from the powerlaw continuum.

Each of the set of figures shows the decomposed components of model B in a period. The black line above shows the overall model without Galactic\nabsorption and the edge. The blue line represents a \u0393 = 2.11 powerlaw. The red dash line shows the ionised reflection component. The neutral reflection\ncomponent stays constant throughout the periods and is omitted for the purpose of clarity.\n\npowerlaw component varies in time in a similar manner to the overall light curve (see Fig. 7) and is the dominant cause of flux variability in the source. This is often the case observed in Seyfert 1 galaxies (e.g. MCG-6-30-15). The ionised reflection flux, on the other\nhand, remains at a constant level within the uncertainties through\nthe four periods. However, the evolution of ionisation parameter\ndoes not follow the trend laid out by the powerlaw component as\nexpected from the \u03be = Lion /nR2 definition of the ionisation parameter if the product nR2 remains constant. Irrespective of which\nmodel is used, i.e. with or without the extra edge, the ionisation\nparameter decreases with time.\nWe depict the evolution of of the powerlaw and the reflection\ncomponents in Fig. 10. As the neutral reflection component is not\nexpected to vary in these time scales, we only plot the unabsorbed\nreflection (ionised plus neutral) component together with the power\nlaw continuum. From period 1 to period 2, the reflection component\nstays more or less constant but the powerlaw component drops. It\ncan be seen that the drop in the powerlaw between periods 1 and 2\ncould, by itself, give rise to an apparent soft excess in the difference\nspectrum. The drop in the ionisation parameter in periods 3 and 4\ncauses the low energy part of the reflection to appear lower in comparison to the continuum. This would of course have the effect of\nproducing an even stronger soft excess in the difference spectrum.\nIt is clear from this qualitative description of the evolution of the\nreflection component that the soft excess seen in both the real and\ndifference spectrum (as well as the broad iron line seen in Fig. 5)\nc 2012 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201310\n\ncould indeed be caused solely by the changes in the ionised reflector and powerlaw continuum.\nWe try to fit the Suzaku difference spectra presented in Fig.\n3 with an absorbed powerlaw and an ionised reflection component.\nThe parameters of the reflection component were set to be the same\nas those obtained for the time-averaged spectral analysis. We find\nthat the simple model indeed fits the difference spectra well, indicating that the excess shown in the soft difference spectra could alternatively be caused by the change in the ionisation parameter. Interestingly, a similar conclusion was reached by Reis et al. (2012),\nwhere the authors find that changes in the ionisation parameter was\nnecessary to explain the hard excess seen in the difference spectra\nof the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 3783. In that case, the hard excess\nwere due to dramatic changes in the level of the Compton hump.\n\n4 DISCUSSION\n4.1 High Iron Abundance or Absorption Edge\nThe iron abundance in a galaxy can be super-solar if there is a high\nlevel of star formation. Some Seyfert I galaxies have super-solar\nabundances, for instance, 1H0707-495, which strongly requires\nabundances over eight times of solar value (Fabian et al. 2009).\nHowever, 1H0707-495 shows the distinct presence of a strong FeK (\u223c 970 eV) emission line as well as Fe-L emission (Fabian et al.\n2009; Zoghbi et al. 2010, 2011). Such strong Fe-K emission requires a high iron abundance to explain. The high iron abundance\n\n\f8\n\nC.-Y.

The figure shows the contour plot of the depth of the absorption\nedge against the iron abundance.\n\nis also the reason why Fe-L emission is seen in the spectrum of\n1H0707-495. Nevertheless, the Fe-K line in CBS 126 is not particularly strong, as would be expected if the abundance was indeed\n> 9. The Fe-L feature is not present in the soft X-ray spectrum either. Therefore we find it highly unlikely that the source has such\nhigh iron abundances. In addition, it is difficult to explain the excess above the powerlaw continuum discovered at low-energies in\nthe difference spectra using model A, as the RMS spectrum suggest that there are no components contributing extra variability in\nthe low-energy band.\nFig. 11 shows the contour plot of iron abundance against the\ndepth of the absorption edge, and contours are plotted at 67%, 90%\nand 99% levels. The value of iron abundance spans a wide range\nfrom 3 to 10 in the contour plot, implying CBS 126 is likely supersolar, but the value of iron abundance is not constrained by the current dataset. We cannot make a correct measurement of the iron\nabundance yet. However, the Fe-K line presented in the spectrum\nis not particularly strong, the assumption of solar abundance used\nin Model B seems to be more reasonable.\n\n1.4\n1.2\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n3\n\n5\nEnergy (keV)\n\n7\n\n10\n\nFigure 12. The figure shows the Suzaku FI XIS spectrum fitted with model\nB. The red arrow at \u223c 6.6 keV in the figure indicates a possible Fe XXVI\nabsorption line.\n\n4.3 Variation of the Ionisation Parameter\nCBS 126 shows enormous variability in long-term X-ray observations (see Fig. 1), and it is also variable in short-term observations\nlike the one discussed in this paper. The time-resolved analysis indicates the ionisation parameter varies with time. The powerlaw\ncomponent does not vary a lot during the observation, but the ionisation parameter drops significantly in period 3, and it is likely\nthat an increase in the hydrogen number density of the disc or the\nheight of the corona caused the drop in \u03be = Lion /nR2 . The hydrogen number density of the disc is expected not to change significantly within a short period of time. The RMS spectrum indicates\nthat the disc component does not contribute significant variability.\nIt is more likely that the properties of the accretion disc remain\nconstant. Assuming n remains constant, R needs to increase by a\nfactor of \u223c 1.4 between period 2 and 3 in order to explain the drop\nin ionisation parameter seen here.\nAs stated in section 3.2.2, different ionisation parameters produce different amount of soft excess. The excess at the soft Xray band seen in the Suzaku difference spectra could be a result\nof changing ionisation parameter. However, this again needs to be\nconfirmed by a more detailed observation.\n\n4.2 Possibility of the Existence of Warm Absorbers\nBoth the time-averaged and the time-resolved spectra can be fitted successfully by model B. The absorption edge has an energy\nof \u223c 0.88 keV, close to the OVIII edge and Ne I, Ne II edges\n(Daltabuit & Cox 1972). The edge is possibly part of the absorption caused by a warm absorber. Moreover, it seems there is a weak\nabsorption line at \u223c 6.6 keV (see Fig. 12) with an EW = \u221254+44\n\u221234\neV, which may be a Fe XXVI absorption line caused by a highly\nionised warm absorber. This kind of warm absorber produces few\nabsorption lines in the low-energy spectra. Therefore the absorption\nedge at \u223c 0.88 keV, if real, is likely caused by a different warm\nabsorber. However, the Suzaku XIS does not have enough energy\nresolution to confirm the existence of warm absorbers. The Swift\nXRT covers soft X-ray energies down to 0.3 keV but does not have\nenough energy resolution either. A more powerful instrument and\nan observation with a longer exposure time may be needed to confirm the assumption. Such an observation will also help index the\nabsorption edge.\n\n5 CONCLUSION\nWe test the relativistic reflection model on the new X-ray observation carried out in late 2010 of the BLS1 galaxy CBS 126. The\nspectra show an enormous soft excess in low-energy band, which\nis difficult to be explained by only the relativistic reflection continuum. An iron abundance larger than 9 times the solar value is\nneeded to produce the soft excess. Based on the information offered by the difference spectra and the RMS spectrum, a multiplicative component such as an absorption edge or a warm absorber is\nmore likely. We find the model composed of a relativistic reflection\ncontinuum with solar abundance and an absorption edge (Model\nB) is preferred. To investigate this further, we carried out a timeresolved analysis to confirm the presence of this feature. Model\nB which contains an absorption edge and solar abundance fits the\ntime-resolved spectra well. In time-resolved analysis we find the\nionisation parameter drops in period 3, and this is probably caused\nby an increase of the height of the corona. The change in ionisation\nc 2012 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201310\n\n\fModelling CBS 126\nparameter might also cause the excess at the low-energy band seen\nin the difference spectra.\nThis work shows that the reflection model can be used in interpreting the spectra of a BLS1 galaxy. We note that a strong soft excess does not necessarily imply a strong iron K line in the reflection\nscenario. We find the edge model explains both the time-averaged\nand the time-resolved spectra well, and it also interprets what we\nsee in the difference and the RMS spectra. Nevertheless, due to the\nlow signal-to-noise ratio of the data, whether there are warm absorbers in the source cannot be confirmed yet. The absorption edge\nis most likely an OVIII edge, but the possibility of neon cannot be\nruled out. Suzaku and Swift do not have enough resolving power\nin the low-energy band. An observation by Chandra HETGS or\nXMM-Newton RGS may offer more details in the low-energy spectra. Future observation of the higher energy spectra with NuSTAR\nor ASTRO-H can test the reflection model.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nRCR is supported by NASA through the Einstein Fellowship\nProgram, grant number PF1-120087.
