For a start, we show that the fact that the\nLegendre transform of the sum of connected graphs yields the effective action is indeed combinatorial\nin nature and is thus independent of analytic assumptions. Our proof also leads to new methods\nfor the efficient decomposition of Feynman graphs into n-particle irreducible (nPI) subgraphs.\nPACS numbers: 11.10.-z, 02.10.Ox, 11.10.Gh\n\nAt the heart of the path integral formulation of quantum\nfield theory, e.g., on flat space, is the integral over fields,\nZ\nR\nr\nZ[J] = \u03bc eiS[\u03a6]+i J\u03a6 d x D[\u03a6] ,\n(1)\ni.e., the Fourier transform of eiS . Here, S is the classical action, \u03bc = ei\u039b corresponds to the cosmological constant, \u03a6, J stand for (a collection of), e.g., real bosonic\nfields and their corresponding sources, and c = ~ = 1.\nWe assume suitable ultraviolet and infrared cutoffs so\nthat the space\nof fields, equipped with the inner product\nR\nhJ, \u03a6i = J(x)\u03a6(x)dr x, is of finite dimension, say N .\nChoosing an orthonormal basis, {ba }N\na=1 , in the space of\nfields, we have \u03a6 = \u03a6a ba , J = Ja ba , hJ, \u03a6i = Ja \u03a6a , and:\nS[\u03a6] =\n\nX 1\n\u03a6 a * * * \u03a6 an .\nS (n)\nn! a1 ,...,an 1\n\n(2)\n\nn\u22652\n\nTwice occurring indices are to be contracted, i.e.,\nsummed over. S (2) is assumed to contain a Feynman\ni\u01eb term, and we assume S does not lead to a nonzero\nR vacuum fieldQexpectation value. Then, Z[J] =\n\u03bc RN eiS[\u03a6]+iJa \u03a6a j d\u03a6j , after pulling the interaction\nterms before the integral by using derivatives, completing\nthe squares and carrying out the integrations, reads:\nZ[J] = \u03bc\u2032 e\n\nP\n\n(n)\ni\nn>2 n! Sa1 ,...,an \u2202(iJa1 ) ***\u2202(iJan )\n\ni\n\n(2) \u22121\n\ne(iJb ) 2 Sbc\n\n(iJc )\n\nThus, Z[J] is the generating functional of all Feynman\ngraphs g built from the Feynman rules edge = i(S (2) )\u22121 ,\nand n-vertex = iS (n) , with at least one edge. We can\nview Z[J] also as a sum of all graphs with the additional\nFeynman rule 1-vertex = iJa , where each graph g has a\nsymmetry factor \u03c9(g) = 2\u2212l k \u22121 . Here, l is the number of\n\nedges of g joining a vertex with itself and k is the number\nof automorphisms of g. Note that if g is a tree graph with\nlabelled ends (i.e., no 1-vertices) then \u03c9(g) = 1.\nCorrespondingly, let us denote the sum of only the connected graphs by iW [J]. When exponentiated, it yields\nthe sum of all graphs, i.e., exp(iW [J]) = Z[J], as is easy\nto see combinatorially. Further, as is well-known:\nTheorem 1: For a given action, S, let iW [J] denote\nthe sum of all connected graphs. Assume that the power\nseries W [J] converges to a function which is convex. The\ndefinition \u03c6a = \u2202W [J]/\u2202Ja can, therefore, be inverted to\nobtain J[\u03c6]a = (J[\u03c6])a . Then, the Legendre transform of\nW [J], namely \u0393[\u03c6] = \u2212J[\u03c6]a \u03c6a + W [J[\u03c6]], yields i\u0393[\u03c6],\nwhich is the generating functional of the sum of n-point\n(2)\n1-particle\nP irreducible (1PI) graphs for n > 2, and i\u0393 =\n(2)\niS +\n(2-point 1PI graphs). Thus, overall:\nF ourier /\nZ[J] o\neiS[\u03a6] o\n\nlog/exp\n\n/ iW [J] o Legendre / i\u0393[\u03c6].\n\nWe will here question the assumptions underlying Thm.1.\nFirst, let us consider Theorem 1's broad significance:\nA) The practical calculation of Feynman graphs. Any\nconnected graph can be viewed as consisting of maximal\n1PI subgraphs that are connected by edges whose deletion would disconnect the graph. For practical calculations of Feynman graphs, this conveniently identifies the\n1PI graphs as building blocks. After renormalizing them,\nthe 1PI graphs may be glued together to form connected\ngraphs with no further loop integrations needed. Later\nwe shall discuss a strategy for the further decomposition\nof 1PI graphs by extending Thm.1 through higher order,\ni.e., multi-field Legendre transforms.\nB) The action and the generating functional of tree\ngraphs are related by Legendre transform. Continuing the\n\n\f2\ndiscussion of the structure of connected graphs in (A),\nwe notice that any connected graph is a tree graph whose\nvertices are 1PI graphs connected by strings of edges and\n2-point 1PI graphs. Thus, the sum of connected graphs,\niW [J], is also the sum of all tree graphs made from new\nFeynman rules. The new Feynman rules' n-vertex is the\nsum of all n-point 1PI graphs, while the new rules' edge\nis given by \u2212 + \u2212 \u2212 + \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 + \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 + . . .\n\u0001\u22121\n= (\u2212)\u22121 +\n, where\nis the sum of 2-point 1PI\ngraphs and we summed a geometric series. Clearly, these\nare the Feynman rules generated by \u0393[\u03c6] if viewed as an\naction. Thus, the Legendre transform maps the sum of\ntrees, W , into the action \u0393. Now every generating functional of tree graphs, iT [K], is the generating functional\nof connected graphs for some action, F [\u03a8], since Fourier\ntransform and exponentiation are invertible. Thus:\nTheorem 1 (2nd formulation): Let iT [K] denote a sum\nof all tree graphs built from the Feynman rules of some\naction, F [\u03a8]. Assume that the power series T [K] converges to a function which is convex, so that the definition\n\u03a8a = \u2202T [K]/\u2202Ka is invertible, to obtain K[\u03a8]a . Then,\nF [\u03a8] and T [K] are related by Legendre transform:\nF [\u03a8] = \u2212K[\u03a8]a \u03a8a + T [K[\u03a8]].\n\n(3)\n\nBelow, we will prove Thm.1 in this formulation but with\nweaker assumptions.\nC) The perturbative solution to the classical equations\nof motion can be obtained from the sum of Rthe tree graphs.\nTo see this, consider the action, F [\u03a8] + K\u03a8dr x, of a\nclassical system coupled linearly to a source field, or driving force, K. The equations of motion, \u03b4F/\u03b4\u03a8 = \u2212K,\nare to be solved for the field \u03a8[K] as a functional of the\napplied source K. By Thm.1 (2nd formulation),\nthe inR\nverse Legendre transform T [K] = F [\u03a8] + K\u03a8dr x of\nF [\u03a8] yields the generating functional, iT [K], of trees.\nFrom the properties of Legendre transforms we have:\n\u03a8[K] = \u03b4T [K]/\u03b4K. Thus, \u2212i\u00d7 the sum of the tree\ngraphs, iT [K], once differentiated by K, yields the perturbative solution to the classical equations of motion in\npowers of the perturbing source field K.\nD) Effective action. \u0393[\u03c6] plays the r\u00f4le of a quantum effective action because it is that action which when\ntreated classically yields the correct quantum theoretic\nanswer: any n-point function can be calculated as a sum\nof all connected graphs using the Feynman rules of the\naction S or also, as if classical, i.e., as a sum of all tree\ngraphs only, when adopting the Feynman rules generated\nby the effective action \u0393.\nE) Duality of problems and solutions. One usually defines a problem by specifying an action, S, and the classical and quantum solutions are then obtained by calculating T and W respectively. T and eiW are the Legendre\nand Fourier transforms of S and eiS , respectively. Both\ntransforms are invertible. Thus, one may also define a\nproblem by specifying, say, T (or W ). The problem's\n\nsolution is then the action, S. In fact, since the Legendre and Fourier transforms are involutive (up to a trivial\nsign), S can be calculated in the same way by using new,\n\"dual\" Feynman rules: a given W is viewed as an action,\nthe dual Feynman rules are read off, and iS is obtained\nas the sum of all connected graphs. This duality was first\nnoticed in the context of statistical physics, in [1]. Here\nwe add that, similarly, a given T can be viewed as an\naction, dual Feynman rules can be read off, and S can\nthen be calculated from the sum of all tree graphs. For\nexample, in cosmology, there are efforts to reconstruct\nthe potential in the inflaton action, S, from the inflaton\ncorrelation functions in W obtained via measurements\nof the cosmic microwave background [2]. In principle, it\nshould be possible to view W (as far as W is known) as\nan action, read off the dual Feynman rules and calculate\niS as the sum of connected graphs. Similarly, by summing up only the tree graphs, one should, in principle,\nobtain the inflaton's quantum effective action.\nIt appears that every theory specified by an action possesses a Fourier dual as well as a Legendre dual theory.\nThus, e.g., in addition to the Dyson-Schwinger equation\n(\u03b4S/\u03b4\u03a6[\u2212i\u03b4/\u03b4J] + J)eiW [J] = 0, the involutive property\nof the Fourier transform implies a dual Dyson-Schwinger\nequation: (\u03b4W/\u03b4J[i\u03b4/\u03b4\u03a6]\u2212 \u03a6)eiS[\u03a6] = 0. Similarly, there\nare, e.g., dual Slavnov-Taylor identities for gauge theories. We note that an instance where the Legendre transform of an effective action is itself the effective action of a\nknown theory was found in [3] in the context of S-duality\nand weak versus strong coupling regimes. Finally, we notice that the involutive property of the Legendre transform implies that the \"sum of the trees of trees\" must\nreduce to the original sum of the Feynman rules. The\ninvolutive property of the Fourier transform implies a\ncorresponding statement for connected graphs.\nFrom the wave picture to the particle picture.\nAll of the above considerations appear to hinge on analytic assumptions. Namely, it appears that S, Z, W and\n\u0393 should be series that converge to well-defined functions\nwhich possess Fourier and Legendre transforms, respectively. For example, the power series W and \u0393 would\nseem to have to converge to convex functions in order to\npossess Legendre transforms. As is well known, however,\nnot even their convergence can be assumed in QFT, a\nproblem whose solution, it is thought, may require knowledge of non-perturbative or even Planck scale physics.\nThe fact that perturbative QFT is nevertheless very\nsuccessful in practice suggests that it should be possible to make the formalism of QFT mathematically welldefined without analytic assumptions such as convexity\nor even convergence. Within such a framework, it should\nbe possible to prove key theorems combinatorially, such\nas Thm.1, the involution properties of the Fourier and\nLegendre transforms, or the Dyson-Schwinger equations.\nTo this end, we define S, Z, W, \u0393, T and F as elements\nin a ring of formal power series, for bosons as for fermions.\n\n\f3\nAll physically relevant information is encoded in the individual coefficients. For rings of formal power series, see,\ne.g., [4]. For any formal power series F , with F (1) = 0\nand F (2) invertible, (which would require only local convexity), we then define a \"combinatorial Legendre transform\", T , namely as the following map: view F [\u03a8] as an\naction, read off the Feynman rules and then obtain iT [K]\nas the power series generating all tree graphs. We also\ndefine a \"combinatorial Fourier transform\", eiW [J,z] of\neiS[\u03a6] : read off Feynman rules P\nfrom z \u22121 S, where z is an\nindeterminate, and set iW = z connected graphs with\nthe combinatorial factors \u03c9(g). While the edge and vertices are proportional to z and z \u22121 , no negative powers of\nz occur in W . This is because for any connected graph, g,\nthe numbers of edges and vertices, E(g) and V (g), obey\nE(g) \u2212 V (g) \u2265 \u22121. Note that z counts powers in ~ (and\nthus loops). Indeed, the combinatorial Legendre transform is contained in iW [J, z] as the term proportional to\nz 0 . This is because exactly for tree graphs, as is easy to\nverify:\n1 = V (g) \u2212 E(g).\n\n(4)\n\nWithin this framework, Z is defined not through Eq.1,\ni.e., as a sum over all field evolutions (the wave picture) but instead through Z = eiW as a sum over all\nmulti-particle paths (the \"particle picture\"), where the\nterm \"path\" means graph. Notice that the principle that\na particle's classical path is, in a suitable measure, the\nshortest path, while quantum theory requires a sum over\nall paths, persists in second quantization: while the classical solutions are obtained from the tree graphs only,\nQFT requires summing over all graphs. Indeed, tree\ngraphs are the shortest graphs in terms of the number\nof edges for any given number of leaves of the graph, i.e.,\nfor any given perturbation order. Also, the free propagator, i.e., the edge, can itself be viewed as a sum over\npaths. A \"path\" in QFT is, then, a graph of paths.\nThe QFT path integral is mathematically well-defined\nthrough the combinatorial Fourier transform because the\ncalculation of each coefficient involves only a finite number of terms. This suggests the program of trying to\nprove key equations of QFT combinatorially, for example the Dyson-Schwinger equations, or Eq.3. This is nontrivial because, where successful, it shows that the equation in question is fundamentally combinatorial in nature and does not hinge upon analytic assumptions - such\nas assumptions of convergence and convexity in Eq.3 of\nThm.1, or, in the case of the Dyson-Schwinger equations,\nthe assumption that boundary terms can be neglected\nwhen path integrating a total derivative. While one aim\nis to reveal the robustness or fragility of the key equations of QFT with respect to analytic assumptions, any\ndeeper understanding of the key equations in QFT has\nof course the potential to reveal useful new structures.\nStarting this program, we here give a transparent and\nbare-bones combinatorial proof of Thm.1 which shows\n\nthat the theorem is robust against issues of analyticity.\nOur proof shows that the Legendre transform in QFT\ncan be understood, more deeply, as a simple statement\n(namely Eq.4) about tree graphs. This insight then leads\nto useful new results, namely about the decomposition of\nFeynman graphs into their nPI components.\nTheorem 1 in the new framework. In the second\nformulation of Thm.1 above, F may or may not be an\neffective action. Our aim is to prove Thm.1 in this general\nform, but for the combinatorial Legendre transform.\nTheorem 1 (3rd, combinatorial formulation): Let\nP\n(n)\n1\nFa1 ,...,an \u03a8a1 * * * \u03a8an be an element of a\nF [\u03a8] = n\u22652 n!\nring of formal power series in commutative indeterminates \u03a8a . Assuming that the coefficient matrix F (2) is\ninvertible, F [\u03a8] can be viewed as an action that defines\nFeynman rules. The sum of their tree graphs yields a\nformal power series, say iT [K], in variables Ka . By definition, we relate the variables \u03a8 and K through the algebraic derivative \u03a8[K]a = \u2202T [K]/\u2202Ka, which is a welldefined operation in the ring, so that \u03a8[K]a is a formal\npower series in the Kb . Then, the formal power series\nF [\u03a8] and T [K] obey the Legendre transform equation:\nT [K] = Ka \u03a8[K]a + F [\u03a8[K]].\n\n(5)\n\nWe remark that F [\u03a8[K]] is well-defined as a formal power\nseries since \u03a8[K] has no constant term. The theorem\ncovers the special case when the usual analytic Legendre\ntransform of T [K] is well-defined, i.e., the case in which\nT [K] obeys the analytic conditions of Thm.1 in its second\nformulation. This is because in this case the transformed\nvariable obeys \u03a8analytic\n= \u2202T [K]/\u2202Ka = \u03a8a and therea\nfore with F analytic := \u2212\u03a8a Ka + T and Eq.5 we have\nF = F analytic . We can then conclude that the Feynman\nrules underlying T are generated by the Legendre transform F analytic . Notice that Thm.1 in its 1st and 2nd\nformulations makes no claim when the sum of the tree\ngraphs does not converge to a function, or does converge\nbut the function is not convex. Our generalized Thm.1\n(3rd formulation) shows that Eq.5 holds even then.\nIn the literature, Thm.1 is proven in the first formulation above, see [5, 6, 7]. The proof by Weinberg, [8], essentially addresses Thm.1 in its second formulation, i.e.,\ndirectly as a map between any action and its sum of tree\ngraphs. However, that proof relies on analytic assumptions and requires the taking of a subtle limit.\nCombinatorial proof of Thm.1. Our proof strategy\nis to show that i\u00d7Eq.5 is term by term equivalent to\na much simpler statement, namely Eq.4. To this end,\nlet us prove the power series equation i\u00d7Eq.5 for the\ncoefficients of each m-power of K for m \u2265 2. That is,\n(6)\n\u2202/\u2202iKa1 . . . \u2202/\u2202iKam iT |K=0 =\n\u2202/\u2202iKa1 . . . \u2202/\u2202iKam (iKa \u03a8[K]a + iF [\u03a8[K]]) |K=0 .\nBy definition of T [K], on the LHS of Eq.6 we obtain\nthe sum of all tree graphs g with m ends, labelled by\n\n\f4\na1 , . . . , am , with each such g occurring exactly once and\nwith \u03c9(g) = 1. We will complete the proof by showing\nthat the RHS consists of all such graphs with multiplicity\nV (g) \u2212 E(g). We begin by writing the RHS of i\u00d7Eq.5 in\nterms of tree graphs. We have iKa = 1-vertex, and\niF [\u03a8[K]] =\n\nX i\n\u03a8[K]a1 * * * \u03a8[K]an ,\nF (n)\nn! a1 ,...,an\n\n(7)\n\nn\u22652\n\n(n)\n\n(2)\n\ncontains iFa1 ,a2 = \u2212(edge)\u22121 and iFa1 ,...,an = n-vertex\nfor n > 2. Thus, the RHS of i\u00d7Eq.5 takes the form:\n1\n(1-vertex)a \u03a8[K]a \u2212 \u03a8[K]b1 (edge)b\u22121\n\u03a8[K]b2 +\n1 ,b2\n2\nX 1\n(n-vertex)a1 ***an \u03a8[K]a1 * * * \u03a8[K]an .\nn!\nn>2\nAfter differentiating m times and setting K = 0, we obtain Eq.6, which contains only graphs with m labelled\nends. Since, by definition, \u03a8[K]b = \u2202iT [K]/\u2202(iKb) is\nthe sum of trees with one end vertex removed, the RHS\nof Eq.6 is the sum of all tree graphs with m labelled ends\nobtained by taking a term of the action, i.e., \u2212(edge)\u22121\nor any n-vertex, and attaching the sum of all tree graphs\nat each of its free indices. After simplification, this means\nthat Eq.5 reads, schematically:\nP\nP\n\ntrees\n\n=\n\nP\n\ntrees\n\u2022\n\n\u2212\n\nP\n\ntrees\n\n1\n2!\n\n+\nP\n\ntrees\n\ntrees\n\n44\n\nP\n\n\u2022\n1\n3! P\ntrees\n\ntrees\n\n+***\n\nLet us consider an arbitrary tree graph, g, with m labelled ends. On the LHS, it occurs exactly once. To\ncount its occurrences on the RHS, we choose an arbitrary edge e of g, and let l and r arbitrarily denote the\ntwo subtrees to either side of the edge. In the second\nterm on the RHS, the edge e occurs twice, and because\nof the 1/2 in the action, g occurs with weight \u2212E(g).\nWe now choose an arbitrary n-vertex v of g, where n \u2208\n{1, 3, 4, ...}. Let {tj }nj=1 arbitrarily denote the sub-trees\nemanating from its legs. From the remaining terms on\nthe RHS of Eq.5, our vertex v with the attached subtrees\n{tj }nj=1 arises n! times, which is cancelled by the 1/n! in\nthe action. Thus, g occurs V (g) times in the remaining\nterms and therefore indeed with overall weight V (g) \u2212\nE(g) on the RHS.\nOutlook. In a follow-up paper, we will show how\ninsight from our combinatorial proof of Thm.1 yields\na strategy for a more efficient decomposition of Feynman graphs into nPI graphs for practical calculations.\nNamely, recall that we reduced the Legendre transform,\nEq.5, to the simple equation Eq.4, which is Euler's formula, a special case of the general Euler-Poincar\u00e9 formula\nfor the homology of graphs. As we will show in the followup paper, the so-called cactus representation H(g) of nPI\ngraphs g, see [9], can be used to obtain a generalization\nof Eq.4 to 1 = V (H(g)) \u2212 E(H(g)) + C(H(g)) (where C\n\nis the number of cycles) which allows us to generalize the\ndiagrammatic analysis of [6] and improve on the results\non higher order Legendre transforms and the analysis of\nDyson-Schwinger equations of [7]. We will also show that\nthe involutive property of the Legendre transform can be\nproven purely combinatorially. This means that a) the\nsum of trees of trees indeed always reduces to the original\nsum of Feynman rules and b) that every theory has a Legendre dual whose dual is the original theory. We will also\nstudy the involutive property of the Fourier transform.\nThere are a number of further key equations of QFT\nwhich are usually derived using analytic arguments and\nassumptions, and it should be very interesting to use the\ncombinatorial Fourier transform to investigate which of\nthese equations are actually of a purely combinatorial\nnature and therefore robust against analytic difficulties.\nFor example, the origins of anomalies and of ghost fields\nare usually traced, analytically, to the measure in the\nwave picture path integral, Eq.1. Is there a combinatorial derivation of these, perhaps involving what could be\nviewed as a \"measure\" in the particle picture path integral? The usual derivation of the Dyson Schwinger equations assumes that boundary terms in Eq.1 can be neglected. What is the combinatorial analog of derivatives\nand boundary terms for the combinatorial Fourier transform of the particle picture path integral? Also, certain\ndiscontinuities in QFT renormalization can be traced to\nfunctional analytic restrictions of the domain of the wave\npicture path integration, see e.g., [10]. What is the analog in the particle picture path integral?\nAcknowledgement. We acknowledge support by CFI,\nOIT, and the Discovery and CRC programs of NSERC.\n\n[1] C. deDominicis, F.
