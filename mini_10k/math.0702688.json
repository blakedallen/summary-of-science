We address the question of the classification under blow-Nash equivalence\nof simple Nash function germs. We state that this classification coincides with the real\nanalytic classification. We prove moreover that a simple germ can not be blow-Nash\nequivalent to a nonsimple one. The method is based on the computation of relevant\ncoefficients of the real zeta functions associated to a Nash germ via motivic integration.\n\nThe classification of real analytic singularities is a fascinating topic. In particular the\nchoice of a good equivalence relation to study is a crucial point. In this paper we are\nconcerned with the classification of real analytic and semi-algebraic function germs, called\nNash function germs [13], under blow-Nash equivalence [3]. Nash function germs are blowNash equivalent if they become real analytic and semi-algebraically equivalent after some\nresolution of their singularities (see Definition 1.1 for a precise statement). The study\nof such an equivalence relation, typical to the real setting, is motivated by the work of\nT.C. Kuo [10]. He noticed that, if the Whitney family w(x, y) = xy(y \u2212 x)(y \u2212 tx) of real\nfunction germs at the origin admits infinitely many different analytic types for t \u2208 (0, 1),\nit becomes analytically trivial after blowing-up the origin. He introduced in that way the\nnotion of blow-analytic equivalence whose semi-algebraic counterpart is the blow-Nash\nequivalence. For more information concerning blow-analytic and blow-Nash equivalences\nwe refer to the survey [7].\nThe classification of complex and real analytic function germs have already a rich history and many invariants are associated with such germs. The classification begins with\nregarding at the corank, and index in the real context, of the second differential. Then we\ndistinguish between more or less basic singularity types. In the classical book [1] we find\nnotably the classification of all possible types of singularity up to modality two, with some\ncomplete lists given with normal forms of the singularities. Among them, the most simple\nsingularities of modality zero (who admit only finitely many different analytic types in a\nsufficiently small neighbourhood) are the well-known ADE-singularities. Note that this\nclassification still holds with Nash function germs by Nash Approximation Theorem ([13]\nand section 3).\nIn [3] we have already established the invariance of corank and index under blow-Nash\nequivalence. This result was the first step toward a classification of Nash function germs\nwith respect to the blow-Nash equivalence. The analog result concerning blow-analytic\nequivalence is still open.\nIn this paper we go further in the classification and consider simple Nash function\ngerms. We know that, in general, the classification of real analytic (respectively Nash)\nfunction germs does not coincide under analytic and blow-analytic equivalence (respectively Nash or blow-Nash equivalence) as illustrated by Whitney example. Nevertheless,\nit is reasonable to hope that, for sufficiently simple singularities, these classifications may\ncoincide. Theorem 4.1 states that this is actually the case for simple Nash germs under\nblow-Nash equivalence. Namely, simple Nash germs, i.e. Nash germs belonging to the\nlist of ADE-singularities, are blow-Nash equivalent if and only if they are analytically\nequivalent.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification.

The blow-Nash classification not only coincides with\nthe analytic classification for simple Nash germs, but moreover Theorem 5.1 asserts that\na nonsimple Nash germ can not belong to the same blow-Nash class as that of a simple\ngerm!\nWe knew already that blow-Nash equivalence had a nice behaviour with respect to\nmoduli. In particular a Nash family with isolated singularities admits locally only finitely\nmany different blow-Nash types ([3], see also [6, 9]). Theorems 4.1 and 5.1 claim that this\nequivalence relation has also a very nice behaviour in terms of classification results.\nThe paper is organised as follows. In section 1 we recall the definition of the zeta\nfunctions associated with a Nash function germ [3]. These invariants of blow-Nash equivalence, coming from the theory of motivic integration [2], are formal power series whose\ncoefficients are polynomials constructed by considering some measure over spaces of arcs\nconnected to the given germ. The proof of the invariance of the index of corank under\nblow-Nash equivalence in [4] consisted in analysing the informations inclosed in the second\ncoefficient of these formal power series. In this paper we need to inspect deeply inside the\nzeta functions, the informations coding the belonging to a simple singularity type (section\n3). We put particular emphasis in section 2 on the case of quadratic polynomials that will\nbe crucial in the remaining of the paper. Sections 4 and 5 are devoted to the statement\nand the proof of the main theorems.\nAcknowledgments. The author is greatly indebted to T.

Blow-Nash equivalence\nThe blow-Nash equivalence between Nash function germs is the analog in the Nash\nsetting of the blow-analytic equivalence of T.C. Kuo [10]. Note that a Nash function (map,\nisomorphism, space) means a semi-algebraic and real analytic function (map, isomorphism,\nspace). Blow-analytic equivalence has been proven to be a relevant equivalence relation\nbetween real analytic function germs (see [7] for a recent survey). Blow-Nash equivalence\nhas been introduced in [3] as a more algebraic version that enables us to use algebraic\ngeometry, such as motivic integration [2], for its study.\nWe first state its definition and then recall some important properties.\nDefinition 1.1.\n(1) A Nash function germ f : (Rd , 0) \u2212\u2192 (R, 0) admits \u03c0 : (M, \u03c0 \u22121 (0)) \u2212\u2192 (Rd , 0) as\na Nash modification if:\n- \u03c0 is a proper surjective Nash map between semi-algebraic neighbourhoods of\n\u03c0 \u22121 (0) in a Nash space M and of 0 in Rd ,\n- \u03c0 is an isomorphism over the complement of the zero locus of f ,\n- the complexification of \u03c0 is an analytic isomorphism except on some thin\nsubset,\n- f \u25e6 \u03c0 and jac \u03c0 have only normal crossings simultaneously.\n(2) Nash function germs f, g : (Rd , 0) \u2212\u2192 (R, 0) are blow-Nash equivalent if there\nexists a blow-Nash isomorphism h of (Rd , 0) such that f = g \u25e6 h, which means h is\na homeomorphism and moreover there exist Nash modifications \u03c0f : (Mf , Ef ) \u2212\u2192\n(Rd , 0) for f and \u03c0g : (Mg , Eg ) \u2212\u2192 (Rd , 0) for g and a Nash isomorphism H\nbetween (Mf , Ef ) and (Mg , Eg ), which is an isomorphism between the critical loci\nEf and Eg considered as Nash spaces, such that h \u25e6 \u03c0f = \u03c0g \u25e6 H.\nSimilarly to the case of the blow-analytic equivalence, to find the right definition of the\nblow-Nash equivalence is still a work in progress. In particular this definition, where we\nimpose a strong control on the critical loci, is closer to that of [5] than to the original one of\n2\n\n\f[10]. Note that despite its technical aspect, the blow-Nash equivalence has nice geometric\nproperties. For instance there are no moduli for Nash family with isolated singularity\n[3]. Moreover the singular loci of the function germs are preserved [12]. In particular, a\nfunction germ with an isolated singularity can not be equivalent to a function germ with\na nonisolated singularity (this fact will be useful in section 5).\nThe behaviour of the blow-Nash equivalence seems to be better understood by looking at\narcs that cross the singularity at the origin. In that spirit, the first invariant constructed for\nsuch an equivalence relation was the set of possible orders of series obtained by composition\nof a given function germ with analytic arcs passing through the origin. This set, known\nas Fukui Invariant [8], admits a natural generalisation via motivic integration [2]. More\nprecisely not only the set of orders of arcs are invariant, but also some measure of the space\nof arcs that realises a given order [3]. The associated invariants, called zeta functions, will\nplay a crucial role in this paper.\nWe recall now the construction of these zeta functions. First we recall the definition\nand basic properties of the virtual Poincar\u00e9 polynomial of a constructible real algebraic\nset that acts as the measure mentioned before.\nZ\n),\nProposition 1.2. ([11, 3]) Take i \u2208 N \u222a 0. The Betti number bi (*) = dim Hi (*, 2Z\nconsidered on compact nonsingular real algebraic sets, admits an unique extension as an\nadditive map \u03b2i to the category of constructible real algebraic sets, with values in Z. Namely\n\n\u03b2(X) = \u03b2(Y ) + \u03b2(X \\ Y )\nP\ni\nfor Y \u2282 X a closed subvariety of X. The polynomial \u03b2(*) =\ni\u22650 \u03b2i (*)u with values\nin Z[u] is multiplicative: \u03b2(X \u00d7 Y ) = \u03b2(X)\u03b2(Y ) for constructible sets X, Y . Finally\n\u03b2(X) = \u03b2(Y ) for Nash isomorphic constructible real algebraic sets X and Y .\nThe invariant \u03b2i is called the i-th virtual Betti number, and the polynomial \u03b2 the virtual\nPoincar\u00e9 polynomial. By evaluation of the virtual Poincar\u00e9 polynomial at \u22121 one recovers\nthe Euler characteristic with compact support [11].\nThe following simple example illustrates the way to compute, in actual practice, the virtual Poincar\u00e9 polynomial. We will perform more involved computations using intensively\nthe additivity property in sections 2 and 3.\nExample 1.3. If Pk denotes the real projective space of dimension k, which is nonsingular\nZ\n) = 1 for i \u2208 {0, . . . , k}\nand compact, then \u03b2(Pk ) = 1 + u + * * * + uk since dim Hi (Pk , 2Z\nZ\nk\nand dim Hi (P , 2Z ) = 0 otherwise. Now, compactify the affine line A1R in P1 by adding\none point at the infinity. By additivity \u03b2(A1R ) = \u03b2(P1 ) \u2212 \u03b2(point) = u, and so \u03b2(AkR ) = uk\nby multiplicativity.\nNow we are in position to introduce the zeta functions associated with a Nash function\ngerm f : (Rd , 0) \u2212\u2192 (R, 0). Let n \u2208 N. Denote by Pn [t] the set of polynomial arcs with\ncoefficients in Rd of degree at most n vanishing at the origin. We construct the naive zeta\nfunction and the zeta functions with sign of f by considering the measure under the virtual\n\u2212\nPoincar\u00e9 polynomial of the spaces of polynomial arcs An (f ), A+\nn (f ) and An (f ) defined by:\nAn (f ) = {\u03b3(t) \u2208 Pn [t] : ordt f \u25e6 \u03b3(t) = n},\nn\nA\u00b11\nn (f ) = {\u03b3(t) \u2208 Pn [t] : f \u25e6 \u03b3(t) = \u00b1t + * * * } \u2282 An (f )\n\nwhere the dots mean higher order terms.\nThe naive zeta function Zf (T ) of f is the formal power series in Z[u][[T ]] defined by:\nX\nZf (T ) =\n\u03b2(An (f ))T n ,\nn\u22651\n3\n\n\fwhereas the zeta functions with sign are defined by:\nX\nX\n\u22121\nn\nn\nZf+1 (T ) =\n\u03b2(A+1\n(f\n))T\nand\nZ\n(T\n)\n=\n\u03b2(A\u22121\nn\nn (f ))T .\nf\nn\u22651\n\nn\u22651\n\nTheorem 1.4. ([3]) Blow-Nash equivalent Nash function germs share the same naive zeta\nfunction and the same zeta functions with sign.\nRemark 1.5. The original definition of the zeta functions involves a correcting term of\nthe form u\u2212nd in front of T n which is important in the proof of Theorem 1.4 [3]. We omit\nit in this paper for simplicity.\nIn the previous paper [4], we used the invariance under blow-Nash equivalence of the\nT 2 -coefficient of the zeta functions to prove the first step in the classification of Nash\nfunction germs under blow-Nash equivalence:\nCorollary 1.6. ([4]) The corank and index of a Nash function germ are invariant under\nblow-Nash equivalence.\n2. Quadratic case\nThis section is devoted to the computation of the virtual Poincar\u00e9 polynomial of some\nspaces of arcs related to a quadratic polynomial. These results will be useful in section\n3. Moreover their proof, based on an induction process and on the additivity of the\nvirtual Poincar\u00e9 polynomial, will be the prototype for the computations of virtual Poincar\u00e9\npolynomial of spaces of arcs in this paper.\nLet p, q \u2208 N \u222a 0. Let's denote by Qp,q , or simply Q depending on the context, the\nquadratic polynomial:\nq\np\nX\nX\n2\n2\nyj+p\n.\nyi \u2212\nQp,q (y) =\nj=1\n\ni=1\n\n\u01eb defined\nFirst we recall the virtual Poincar\u00e9 polynomial of the algebraic set Yp,q and Yp,q\n\u01eb\nby Yp,q = {Qp,q (y) = 0} and Yp,q = {Qp,q (y) = \u01eb} for \u01eb \u2208 {1, \u22121}.\n\nProposition 2.1.

Namely, we decompose A12n+1 (Q) following the vanishing of\nc11 , c21 , . . . , cp1 in order to make appear an induction process.\nFirst, if c11 6= 0, we must choose ci1 , for i = 1, . . . , p + q, in Yp,q \\ Yp\u22121,q . Now, we may\nchoose freely all other variables in the system, except c12 , c13 , . . . , c12n for which we impose the\nvalue in order the equalities in the system to be satisfied. This part is linearly isomorphic to\nYp,q \\ Yp\u22121,q \u00d7 R2n(p\u22121)+2nq+1 , therefore its contribution to the virtual Poincar\u00e9 polynomial\nof A12n+1 (Q) is u2n(p+q\u22121)+1 \u03b2(Yp,q \\ Yp\u22121,q ).\nWhen c11 = 0, assume first that c21 6= 0. We now choose the ci1 for i = 2, . . . , p + q in\nYp\u22121,q \\ Yp\u22122,q , and similarly we may choose freely all other variables except c22 , c23 , . . . , c22n .\nThis contribution is equal to u2n(p+q\u22121)+1 \u03b2(Yp\u22121,q \\ Yp\u22122,q ).\n\u2217 ).\nWe repeat the argument until cp1 6= 0.

Blow-Nash types of ADE-singularities\nWe know that the corank and index of a Nash function germ are invariant under blowNash equivalence (Corollary 1.6). In order to go further in the classification of singularities,\nthe next step is to deal with simple singularities. Considering real analytic function germs,\ntheir simple singularities have been classified [1]: a real analytic function germ with a\nsimple singularity is analytically equivalent to a polynomial germ belonging to one of the\nfamily:\nAk : \u00b1xk+1 + Qp,q (y) for k \u2265 2,\nDk : x1 (\u00b1x22 \u00b1 x1k\u22122 ) + Qp,q (y) for k \u2265 4,\nE6 : x31 \u00b1 x42 + Qp,q (y),\nE7 : x31 + x1 x32 + Qp,q (y),\nE8 : x31 + x52 + Qp,q (y),\nfor some p, q \u2208 N \u222a 0. This classification holds for Nash function germs. Indeed, let\nf and g be analytically equivalent Nash function germs. Then there exists an analytic\nisomorphism h such that f = g \u25e6 h. By Nash Approximation Theorem [13], there exists\nalso a Nash isomorphism e\nh such that f = g \u25e6 e\nh. Therefore f and g are Nash equivalent.\nIn this section, we state the classification of simple Nash function germs with respect\nto blow-Nash equivalence.\n3.1. Blow-Nash types of Ak -singularities. The Ak -singularities are the singularities\ngiven by the germs fk\u00b1 : (Rp+q+1 , 0) \u2192 (R, 0) defined by\nfk\u00b1 (x, y) = \u00b1xk+1 + Qp,q (y)\nfor k \u2265 2 and some p, q \u2208 N \u222a 0. Note that for k even fk+ (x, y) = fk\u2212 (\u2212x, y) so that fk+ and\nfk\u2212 are linearly equivalent, thus blow-Nash equivalent. In that case we will simply write\nfk .\nWe perform now some computations of virtual Poincar\u00e9 polynomials that will be useful\nto distinguish the blow-Nash type of Ak -singularities in Proposition 3.4.\nLemma 3.1.\n+\n\u2212\n(1) \u03b2({f2n\u22121\n= 0}) = \u03b2(Yp+1,q ) and \u03b2({f2n\u22121\n= 0}) = \u03b2(Yp,q+1 ).\n(2) If p \u2264 q, then\n+\n\u2212\n1\n\u03b2({f2n\u22121\n= 1}) 6= \u03b2({f2n\u22121\n= 1}) = u\u03b2(Yp,q\n),\n\nwhereas if p \u2265 q then\n+\n\u2212\n\u22121\nu\u03b2(Yp,q\n) = \u03b2({f2n\u22121\n= \u22121}) 6= \u03b2({f2n\u22121\n= \u22121}).\n\u00b1\nProof. Let us blow-up the origin in the algebraic variety defined by f2n\u22121\n(x, y) = 0. In\nthe chart given by x = u, yi = vi u with i = 1, . . . , p + q, the blowing-up variety is defined\nby\n\u00b1\nu2 f2n\u22123\n(u, v) = 0\n6\n\n\fwhere v = (v1 , . . . , vp+q ). The blowing-up is an isomorphism out from the origin between\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\nthe strict transform f2n\u22123\n= 0 and f2n\u22121\n= 0, therefore\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u03b2({f2n\u22121\n= 0} \\ {0}) = \u03b2({f2n\u22123\n= 0} \\ {0}).\n\nAs a consequence\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u03b2({f2n\u22121\n= 0}) = \u03b2({f2n\u22123\n= 0})\nby additivity of the virtual Poincar\u00e9 polynomial. Repeating n \u2212 2 times more the blowingup at the origin leads to the first result.\nFor the second result, let us assume p \u2264 q. Applying the change of variables ui =\n\u00b1\nyi + yi+p , vi = yi \u2212 yi+p for i = 1, . . . , p, the equation f2n\u22121\n= 1 becomes\n\n\u00b1x2n +\n\np\nX\n\nu i vi \u2212\n\nq\nX\n\nyj2 = 1.\n\nj=p+1\n\ni=1\n\nIn order to compute the virtual Poincar\u00e9 polynomial of this variety, we decompose it with\nrespect to the vanishing of the variables ui for i = 1, . . . , p. If u1 6= 0, we impose the value\nof v1 so that the equality is satisfied. This contribution equals (u \u2212 1)up+q\u22121 . If u1 = 0,\nwe repeat the argument with u2 6= 0, for a contribution of (u \u2212 1)up+q\u22122 . Repeating this\n\u00b1\nargument until the case u1 = . . . = up = 0 implies that \u03b2({f2n\u22121\n= 1}) is equal to\n(u \u2212 1)\n\np\nX\n\nup+q\u2212i + up \u03b2({\u00b1x2n \u2212\n\nq\nX\n\n1\nyj2 = 1}) = u\u03b2(Yp,q\n) + up \u03b2({\u00b1x2n \u2212\n\nyj2 = 1}).\n\nj=p+1\n\nj=p+1\n\ni=1\n\nq\nX\n\nTo conclude, remark that the non-empty variety\nvirtual Poincar\u00e9 polynomial contrary to {\u2212x2n \u2212\n\n{x2n\n\nPq\n\n2\n\u2212 j=p+1 yj+p\nPq\n2\nj=p+1 yj+p = 1}.\n\n= 1} has a nonzero\n\u0003\n\n3.1.1. Spaces of arcs for Ak -singularities. We compute the virtual Poincar\u00e9 polynomial of\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\nsome spaces of arcs A\u00b11\nl (fk ) associated with the function germs fk . Namely, we consider\nthose polynomial arcs \u03b3(t) defined by\nfk\u00b1 (\u03b3(t)) = \u00b1tl + * * *\nwhere the dots stand for higher order terms. In case k is sufficiently large with respect to\n\u00b1\nl, only the quadratic part of fk\u00b1 plays a role in the space of arcs A\u00b11\nl (fk ). Therefore the\nnext lemma is a direct consequence of Proposition 2.2.\nLemma 3.2. Let k \u2265 l > 2 and \u01eb \u2208 {1, \u22121}. Then \u03b2(A\u01ebl (fk\u00b1 )) = ul \u03b2(A\u01ebl (Qp,q )).\nSecond, we deal with the first space of arcs associated with fk\u00b1 that takes into account\nthe x-variable, namely A\u01ebk+1 (fk\u00b1 ).\nLemma 3.3. Take \u01eb \u2208 {1, \u22121}.\n(1) \u03b2(A\u01eb2n+1 (f2n )) = u(n+1)(p+q)+2n + u2n+1 \u03b2(A\u01eb2n+1 (Q)).\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u01eb )).\n= \u01eb}) \u2212 u\u03b2(Yp,q\n)) = u2n \u03b2(A12n (Q)) + un(p+q)+2n\u22121 (\u03b2({f2n\u22121\n(2) \u03b2(A\u01eb2n (f2n\u22121\nProof.\n(1) The system of equations is the same as that of Lemma 2.2 up to the last equation\nthat has an additional additive term \"+a2n+1\n\", namely\n1\na12n+1\n\n+\n\nn\nX\n\n\u03a6(cs , c2n+1\u2212s ) = \u01eb.\n\ns=1\n\nThe same method applies, with the only difference that at the last step, namely\n= \u01eb still\nwhen ci1 = . . . = cin = 0 for i = 1, . . . , p + q, the remaining equation a2n+1\n1\nadmits a solution.

Recall that in case k is even, the function germs\nfk+ and fk\u2212 are blow-Nash equivalent. We distinguish all other blow-Nash types by using\nthe invariance under the blow-Nash equivalence of the zeta functions recalled in Theorem\n1.4. Recall that equivalent function germs share the same quadratic part (Corollary 1.6).\nProposition 3.4. If fk\u01ebk is blow-Nash equivalent to fl\u01ebl , with \u01ebk , \u01ebl \u2208 {+, \u2212}, then k = l.\nMoreover if k = l is odd, then \u01ebk = \u01ebl .\nCorollary 3.5. Two germs with Ak -singularities are blow-Nash equivalent if and only if\nthey are analytically equivalent.\nProof of Proposition 3.4. If k 6= l assume for instance k < l. For even k, then \u03b2(A1k+1 (fk ))\nis different from \u03b2(A1k+1 (fl\u00b1 )) thanks to Lemma 3.3.1. For k odd, Lemma 3.3.2 combined\nwith Lemma 3.1.2 assert that either\n\u03b2(A1k+1 (fk\u00b1 )) 6= \u03b2(A1k+1 (fl\u00b1 ))\nor\n\n\u00b1\n\u22121\n\u00b1\n\u03b2(A\u22121\nk+1 (fk )) 6= \u03b2(Ak+1 (fl )).\n\nTherefore the zeta functions of fk\u00b1 and fl\u00b1 are different, and thus fk\u00b1 and fl\u00b1 can not be\nblow-Nash equivalent.\nIf k = l is odd, Lemma 3.3.2 combined with Lemma 3.1.2 assert once more that either\n\u03b2(A1k+1 (fk+ )) 6= \u03b2(A1k+1 (fk\u2212 )),\nin the case p \u2264 q, or\n\n\u2212\n\u22121\n+\n\u03b2(A\u22121\nk+1 (fk )) 6= \u03b2(Ak+1 (fl ))\n\nif p > q, so that fk+ and fk\u2212 can not be blow-Nash equivalent.\n\n\u0003\n\n3.2. Blow-Nash types of Dk -singularities. The Dk -singularities are the function germs\ngk\u01eb1 ,\u01eb2 : (Rp+q+2 , 0) \u2192 (R, 0) defined by\ngk\u01eb1 ,\u01eb2 (x1 , x2 , y) = x1 (\u01eb1 x22 + \u01eb2 x1k\u22122 ) + Qp,q (y)\nfor k \u2265 4, \u01eb1 , \u01eb2 \u2208 {+, \u2212} and some p, q \u2208 N \u222a 0.\nNote that for k odd, the equality gk+,\u01eb2 (\u2212x1 , x2 , y) = gk\u2212,\u01eb2 (x1 , x2 , y) holds so that gk+,\u01eb2\nand gk\u2212,\u01eb2 are linearly equivalent, and therefore blow-Nash equivalent. Similarly, for k even\ngk\u01eb1 ,\u01eb2 (\u2212x1 , x2 , y) = gk\u2212\u01eb1 ,\u2212\u01eb2 (x1 , x2 , y) so that gk\u01eb1 ,\u01eb2 and gk\u2212\u01eb1 ,\u2212\u01eb2 are blow-Nash equivalent.\nThe next lemma will be useful in order to determine the blow-Nash types of Dk singularities in Proposition 3.11.\nLemma 3.6.\n8\n\n\f(1) If k is odd, then \u03b2({x1 x22 + x1k\u22121 = 1}) = 2u.\n(2) If k is even, then \u03b2({x1 x22 + x1k\u22121 = 1}) = u and \u03b2({x1 x22 \u2212 x1k\u22121 = 1}) = 2u.\nProof. We compute the virtual Poincar\u00e9 polynomial of these plane curves by compactifying\nthe curve, and then resolving its singularities. Assume k is odd. Compactifying the\nnonsingular curve {x1 x22 + x1k\u22121 = 1} in the projective plane gives a singular curve C\nwith one point p, singular, at infinity. By invariance under algebraic isomorphisms of the\nvirtual Poincar\u00e9 polynomial, we obtain\n\u03b2({x1 x22 + x1k\u22121 = 1}) = \u03b2(C \\ {p}).\ne be a resolution of the singularities of C.

Finally\n\n\u03b2({x1 x22 + x1k\u22121 = 1}) = \u03b2(C \\ {p}) = 2u.\nThe results in the case k even come from the fact that the resolution of the singularities\nof the nonsingular plane curve {x1 x22 + x1k\u22121 = 1} has one component, whereas that of\n{x1 x22 \u2212 x1k\u22121 = 1} has two components.\n\u0003\n3.2.1.

At the first step, we consider the disjunction of cases given by c11 6= 0, then by c11 = 0\n= 0 and cp1 6= 0. Note that the as and bs\nand c21 6= 0, . . ., finally by c11 = . . . = cp\u22121\n1\nvariables do not intervene.

If b1 6= 0, then necessarily a1 = 0. We may describe the\nsolutions of the system by imposing the value of a2 , . . . , a2n\u22121 . This part contributes to\n\u03b2(A12n+1 (G)) as (u \u2212 1)u2n+2+2n(p+q) .\nThe remaining equations correspond to the system defining A\u01eb2n\u22121 (G) via the change of\ncoordinates \u00e3s = as , b\u0303s = bs+1 , c\u0303is = cis+1 with s = 1, . . . , 2n \u2212 1 and i = 1, . . . , p + q.

Classification of Dk -singularities. Take \u01eb1 , \u01eb2 \u2208 {+, \u2212}. Recall that in the case k\nodd, the germs gk+,\u01eb2 and gk\u2212,\u01eb2 are blow-Nash equivalent whereas in the case k even gk\u01eb1 ,\u01eb2\nand gk\u2212\u01eb1 ,\u2212\u01eb2 are blow-Nash equivalent.\nProposition 3.11. Take \u01eb1 , \u01eb2 , \u03c31 , \u03c32 \u2208 {+, \u2212}. If gk\u01eb1 ,\u01eb2 is blow-Nash equivalent to gl\u03c31 ,\u03c32 ,\nthen k = l. If moreover k = l is odd then \u01eb2 = \u03c32 , whereas if k is even then \u01eb1 \u01eb2 = \u03c31 \u03c32 .\nCorollary 3.12. Two germs with Dk -singularities are blow-Nash equivalent if and only\nif they are analytically equivalent.\nProof of Proposition 3.11. Assume k < l. We prove that the coefficients of T k\u22121 in at\nleast one of the zeta functions of gk\u01eb1 ,\u01eb2 and gl\u03c31 ,\u03c32 are different.\nIf (p, q) = (0, 0) the result comes directly from Lemma 3.9.1. Otherwise, if k is even it\nsuffices to prove that\n\u03b2({gk\u01eb1 ,\u01eb2 (x1 , x2 , 0) = \u01eb}) \u2212 (u \u2212 1)\ncan not be the zero polynomial thanks to Lemma 3.9.2. This is guaranteed by Lemma\n3.6.2.\nIf k is odd, it suffices to prove by Remark 3.10 that\nc\n\u03b2({gk\u01eb1 ,\u01eb2 (x1 , 0, y) 6= 0}) \u2212 u\u03b2(Yp,q\n)\n\ncan not be the zero polynomial. If \u01eb2 = + note that\nc\n\u03b2({gk\u01eb1 ,+ (x1 , 0, y) 6= 0}) = \u03b2(Yp+1,q\n)\n\nby Lemma 3.1.1. But \u03b2(Yp+1,q ) can not be equal to u\u03b2(Yp,q ) thanks to Lemma 2.1.\nActually for p < q the former equals up+q \u2212uq\u22121 +up+1 whereas the latter is up+q \u2212uq +up+1 ,\nand for p = q the former equals u2p whereas the latter is u2p \u2212 up + up+1 . Therefore the\n11\n\n\fT k\u22121 coefficients of the naive zeta functions of gk\u01eb1 ,+ and gl\u03c31 ,\u03c32 are different. Similarly if\n\u01eb2 = \u2212 then\nc\n\u03b2({gk\u01eb1 ,\u2212 (x1 , 0, y) 6= 0}) = \u03b2(Yp,q+1\n)\nc ). Thus the T k\u22121 coefficients of the naive zeta functions\nwhich can not be equal to u\u03b2(Yp,q\n\u01eb1 ,\u2212\n\u03c31 ,\u03c32\nof gk\nand gl\nare still different.\nIf k = l is odd, the difference between the T k\u22121 -coefficients in the zeta functions\nwith sign of gk\u01eb1 ,\u01eb2 and gk\u03c31 ,\u03c32 may appear in the expressions \u03b2({\u01eb2 x1k\u22121 + Q(y) = \u01eb})\nand \u03b2({\u03c32 x1k\u22121 + Q(y) = \u01eb}) by Lemma 3.9.3. But k \u2212 1 being even, these polynomials\nare equal if and only if \u01eb2 = \u03c32 by Lemma 3.1.2. The argument is similar for k = l even,\ncombining Lemma 3.9.2 and Lemma 3.6.\n\u0003\n\n3.3.

A germ with a Ak -singularity can not be blow-Nash equivalent to a Dl , E6 , E7 or\nE8 -singularity by Corollary 1.6 since the former has corank one whereas the latter has\ncorank two. Therefore we are reduced to consider only corank two germs.\nAssume g = gk has a Dk -singularity.

Note\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\nthat \u03b2(A\u00b11\n3 (g4 )) is equal to the virtual Poincar\u00e9 polynomial of the space of arcs A3 for\n\u00b1\nh6 , h7 , h8 by Lemma 3.13.\nActually:\n\u2217 ) + (u \u2212 1)u3(p+q)+5 + u2(p+q)+6 \u03b2(Y \u01eb ),\n\u03b2(A\u01eb4 (g4+ )) = u3(p+q)+6 \u03b2(Yp,q\np,q\n\u2212\n\u2217 ) + 3(u \u2212 1)u3(p+q)+5 + u2(p+q)+6 \u03b2(Y \u01eb ),\n\u03b2(A\u01eb4 (g4 )) = u3(p+q)+6 \u03b2(Yp,q\np,q\n\u2217 ) + (u \u2212 1)2 u3(p+q)+5 + u2(p+q)+6 \u03b2(Y c ),\n\u03b2(A4 (g4+ )) = (u \u2212 1)u3(p+q)+6 \u03b2(Yp,q\np,q\n\u2217 ) + 3(u \u2212 1)2 u3(p+q)+5 + u2(p+q)+6 \u03b2(Y c ).\n\u03b2(A4 (g4\u2212 )) = (u \u2212 1)u3(p+q)+6 \u03b2(Yp,q\np,q\n\nWe postpone the details of these computations for a moment. Note that\n\u2217\n\u01eb\n\u03b2(A\u01eb4 (h)) = u3(p+q)+6 \u03b2(Yp,q\n) + u2(p+q)+7 \u03b2(Yp,q\n)\n\nfor h = h7 , h8 and \u01eb \u2208 {1, \u22121} by Lemma 3.13, and this polynomial is different from\n\u01eb ) is equal either to (u \u2212 1)up+q\u22121\n\u03b2(A\u01eb4 (g4\u00b1 )). Indeed the equality would imply that \u03b2(Yp,q\np+q\u22121\nor 3(u \u2212 1)u\n. That can not happen thanks to Proposition 2.1. Therefore g4\u00b1 can not\nblow-Nash equivalent neither to h7 nor to h8 .\n+\nFinally, let's prove that g4\u00b1 can not be blow-Nash equivalent to h\u00b1\n6 . Consider h6 first.\n\u00b1\n+\nThe equality of the virtual Poincar\u00e9 polynomial of A4 (g4 ) and A4 (h6 ) would imply by\n13\n\n\fLemma 3.13.2 that\nc\nc\n\u03b1(u \u2212 1)2 u3(p+q)+5 + u2(p+q)+6 \u03b2(Yp,q\n) = u2(p+q)+6 \u03b2(Yp+1,q\n),\nc ) should be\nc\n) \u2212 \u03b2(Yp,q\nwhere \u03b1 = 1 for g4+ and \u03b1 = 3 for g4\u2212 . As a consequence \u03b2(Yp+1,q\n2\np+q\u22121\nequal to \u03b1(u \u2212 1) u\n. This can not happen since\n\u001a\n(u \u2212 1)2 up+q\u22121 + up (1 \u2212 u) if p < q,\nc\nc\n\u03b2(Yp+1,q ) \u2212 \u03b2(Yp,q ) =\n(u \u2212 1)2 up+q\u22121 + up\u22121 (u \u2212 1) if p \u2265 q\n\nby Proposition 2.1.\nSimilarly g4\u00b1 and h\u2212\n6 can not be blow-Nash equivalent because an equality of the virtual\nPoincar\u00e9 polynomial of their spaces of arcs A4 would imply the equality\n\u001a\n(u \u2212 1)2 up+q\u22121 + uq\u22121 (u \u2212 1) if p < q + 1,\n\u03b1(u \u2212 1)2 up+q\u22121 =\n(u \u2212 1)2 up+q\u22121 + uq (1 \u2212 u) if p \u2265 q + 1.\nThis is forbidden by Proposition 2.1.\nTo complete the proof, it remains to check the value of the virtual Poincar\u00e9 polynomial for A4 (g4\u00b1 ) and A\u01eb4 (g4\u00b1 ) announced upper. The corresponding system of equations is\n(keeping the notations from section 3.2):\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 Q(c1 ) = 0\na1 (b21 \u00b1 a21 ) + \u03a6(c1 , c2 ) = 0\n\uf8f3\n2a1 b1 b2 + a2 b21 + 3a21 a2 + Q(c2 ) + \u03a6(c1 , c3 ) = \u01eb\n\nSimilarly to the proof of Lemma 3.1, we decompose this algebraic set in order to compute its virtual Poincar\u00e9 polynomial. Note that the difference between \u03b2(A\u01eb4 (g4+ )) and\n\u03b2(A\u01eb4 (g4\u2212 )) comes from the fact that, at the step ci1 = 0 for i = 1, . . . , p + q, the second\nequation becomes a1 (b21 \u00b1 a21 ) = 0. If a1 6= 0, then no solution exists for g4+ whereas for\ng4\u2212 it gives a contribution of 2(u \u2212 1). Then if a1 = 0, the third equation is the same in\nboth cases.\n\u0003\nThe same method applies for \u03b2(A4 (g4\u00b1 )).\n5. Simple versus nonsimple singularities\nNext step in the classification is to be able to distinguish between simple and nonsimple\nsingularities. Namely, may a nonsimple Nash function germ belong to the same blow-Nash\nequivalence class as that of a simple one?\nTheorem 5.1. Let f, g : (Rd , 0) \u2192 (R, 0) be Nash function germs. Assume f is simple.\nIf f and g are blow-Nash equivalent, then g must be simple.\nFor the proof of Theorem 5.1, we need first to reduce the possible types for the nonsimple\ngerms before analysing more in details the possible spaces of arcs as in the proof of Theorem\n4.1.\nCorollary 5.2. Let f, g : (Rd , 0) \u2192 (R, 0) be Nash function germs. Assume f is simple.\nThen f and g are blow-Nash equivalent if and only if f and g are analytically equivalent.\nRemark 5.3. This result is maximal in the sense that it remains no longer true among\nnonsimple singularities. The family ft (x, y) = x4 + 2tx2 y 2 + y 4 + y 5 defined on (R2 , 0) is\nblow-Nash trivial along t > 0 since its homogeneous part admits an isolated singularity\n[3]. However the multiplicity is 9 for t 6= 1 whereas for t = 1 it becomes 11.\nIn view of the proof of Theorem 5.1, we recall part of Arnold list of corank two nonsimple\nreal isolated singularities [1]. We are interested in those singularities with nonzero 3-jet.\n14\n\n\fLet's denote A1 = 0 and Ak (x) = a0 + a1 x + * * * + ak\u22122 xk\u22122 for k > 1 and a0 , . . . , ak\u22122 \u2208\nR. A nonsimple Nash function germ of corank two with an isolated singularity at the\norigin and a nonzero 3-jet is Nash equivalent to one of the following function germs:\n2k+1\nJk,0 : x31 \u00b1 bx21 xk2 \u00b1 x3k\nfor k > 1 and 4b3 + 27 6= 0,\n2 + Ak\u22121 (x2 )x1 x2\nJk,i : x31 \u00b1 x21 xk2 + Ak (x1 )x13k+i for k > 1, i > 0, a0 6= 0,\n+ Ak (x1 )x1 x2k+1\nfor k > 1,\nE6k : x31 \u00b1 x3k+1\n2\n2\n2k+1\n3k+2\n3\nE6k+1 : x1 + x1 x2\n+ Ak (x1 )x2\nfor k > 1,\n2k+2\n+\nA\n(x\n)x\nx\nfor k > 1.\nE6k+2 : x31 \u00b1 x3k+2\nk 1 1 2\n2\n\nActually, the result holds in the real analytic setting, and the Nash case is a consequence\nof Nash Approximation Theorem (see section 3).\nProof of Theorem 5.1. To begin with, note that g must have an isolated singularity similarly as f because f and g are blow-Nash equivalent [12].\nFor the same reason they also share the same corank and index by Corollary 1.6. Therefore we may suppose that f and g have the same quadratic part Q. Note that possible\ncoranks for simple function germs are one or two. In case of corank one, then g has an\nAk -singularity and Theorem 5.1 is proved. Otherwise, we may suppose that f and g are\ndefined by\nf (x1 , x2 , y) = fe(x1 , x2 ) + Q(y),\ng(x1 , x2 , y) = ge(x1 , x2 ) + Q(y),\n\nwhere fe has a corank two simple singularity and e\ng is a Nash germ with order at least 3.\nNote that fe must be of type Dk or E6 , E7 , E8 as a corank two simple germ. Let's assume\nthat g is not simple.\nWe have proved in section 3 that, for such a simple germ f = fe + Q of corank two, the\nvirtual Poincar\u00e9 polynomial of the arc spaces A\u00b1\n3 (f ) is not simply equal to the contribution\ncoming from the quadratic part (x1 , x2 , y) 7\u2192 Q(y), but an additional term does exist.\nNamely\n\u00b1\n2(p+q)\ne\n\u03b2(A\u00b1\n\u03b2(A\u00b1\n3 (f )) = \u03b2(A3 (Q)) + u\n3 (f ))\n\ne\nwith \u03b2(A\u00b1\n3 (f )) 6= 0, where (p, q) denotes the index of f .\n\u00b1\nTherefore \u03b2(A\u00b1\n3 (g)) must be different from \u03b2(A3 (Q)) because f and g share the same\nzeta functions. As a consequence e\ng must have a nonzero 3-jet. According to Arnold list,\nthe degree 3 homogeneous part e\ng3 of ge can be supposed to be equal to ge3 (x1 , x2 ) = x31 , and\ng must belong to one of the families of corank two nonsimple real isolated singularities\nwith a nonzero 3-jet.\nMoreover g can not be blow-Nash equivalent to a Dk -singularity. Actually\n3\n\u00b1\n2(p+q)+5\n\u03b2(A\u00b1\n3 (x1 + Q(y, z))) = \u03b2(A3 (Q)) + u\n\nis different from\n\u00b1\n2(p+q)+4\n\u03b2(A\u00b1\n(u \u2212 1)\n3 (G)) = \u03b2(A3 (Q)) + u\n\nby Lemma 3.7, so g can not be blow-Nash equivalent to a Dk -singularity for k > 4.\nMoreover \u03b2(A\u01eb3 (x31 + Q(y, z))) is different from\n2(p+q)+5\n\u03b2(A\u01eb3 (x1 x22 \u2212 \u01ebx31 + Q(y, z))) = \u03b2(A\u00b1\n3 (Q)) + 2u\n\nby Lemma 3.9, so g can not either be blow-Nash equivalent to a D4 -singularity.\nTo complete the proof, it suffices to show that g can not belong to the same blow-Nash\nclass as that of a E6\u00b1 , E7 or E8 singularity. Assume that f is of one of these types.\nAnalogously, the computations of Lemma 3.13 prove that at least one of the virtual\n\u00b1\nPoincar\u00e9 polynomials of the arc spaces A\u00b1\n4 (f ) or A5 (f ) is not equal to the corresponding\n15\n\n\fpolynomial for the germ h : (x1 , x2 , y) 7\u2192 x31 + Q(y), namely\n3(p+q)+6\n\u2217\n\u00b1\n\u03b2(A\u00b1\n\u03b2(Yp,q\n) + u2(p+q)+7 \u03b2(Yp,q\n)\n4 (h)) = u\n\nand\n\n4(p+q)+7\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u03b2(A\u00b1\n\u03b2(Yp,q\n) + u3(p+q)+8 \u03b2(Yp,q\n).\n5 (h)) = u\nTherefore e\ng must have a nonzero degree 4 or degree 5 homogeneous part since\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u03b2(A\u00b1\n4 (f )) = \u03b2(A4 (g)) and \u03b2(A5 (f )) = \u03b2(A5 (g)).\n\nAs a consequence, the function germ ge must belong to one of the families J2,0 , J3,0 , J2,i , J3,i\n\u00b1\nfor i > 0. But, even for members of these families, the arc spaces A\u00b1\n4 (g), A5 (g) are the\nsame as that of h. Indeed the composition with ge of an arc \u03b3(t) = (a1 t + . . . , b1 t + . . .) is\nof the form\ng(\u03b3(t)) = a31 t3 + a21 (* * * )t4 + a1 (* * * )t5 + * * *\ne\nso that the vanishing of a1 implies the freedom of all other variables.\nConsequently g can not either be blow-Nash equivalent to a E6\u00b1 , E7 or E8 singularity. \u0003\nReferences\n[1] V.
