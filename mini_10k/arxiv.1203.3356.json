It indicates that unentangled states\nmay process quantumness which can be exploited in\ncertain types of quantum information processing tasks.\nThere are several versions of quantum discord. The first\ndefinition of quantum discord is introduced by Ollivier\nand Zurek [3]and, independently, by Henderson and Vedral [4]. The quantum discord\nof a composite\nsystem AB\n\u0001\nP\npi S \u03c1B|i +S (\u03c1A )\u2212S (\u03c1AB ),\nis defined by DA \u2261 min\n{EiA } i\nwhere S (\u03c1AB ) = T r (\u03c1AB log2 \u03c1AB ) is the von Neumann\nentropy and the minimum is taken\nall positive oper\b over\nA\non\nthe subsystem\nator valued measures(POVMs)\nE\ni\n\u0001\nof the iA with pi = T r EiA \u03c1AB being the probability\n\u0001\u000e\nth outcome and \u03c1B|i = T rA EiA \u03c1AB pi being the conditional state of subsystem B. The minimum can also\nbe taken over the von Neumann measurements. Because\nof the minimization taken over all possible POVMs, or\nvon Neumann measurements, it is generally difficult to\nget analytical results. In order to overcome this difficulty geometric measure of quantum discord (GMQD)\nhas been introduced by Dakic et al [5]. GMQD is deg\nfined by DA\n= min k\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c7k2 , where \u03a90 denotes the set\n\u03c7\u2208\u03a90\n\n2\n\n2\n\nof zero-discord states and kX \u2212 Y k = T r (X \u2212 Y ) is\nthe square norm in the Hilbert-Schmidt space. The subscript A denotes that the measurement is taken on the\nsystem A. Especially, Dakic et al [6] showed that the\nGMQD is related to the fidelity of remote state preparation which provides an operational meaning to GMQD.\nBecause of the unavoidable interaction between a\nquantum system and its environment, another interesting\narea of investigation of the discord is its behaviour under\ndifferent noisy environments [7\u201312]. It has been shown\nthat quantum discord is more robust than entanglement\nfor both Markovian and non-Markovian dissipative processes. In particular, the discord of a sort of Bell-diagonal\nstates subject to a phase damping noises was shown to\nexhibit a freezing phenomenon, [10]i.e., the quantum discord can be completely unaffected by decoherence for a\nfinite period of time. Lang and Caves [13] provide a\ncomplete geometric picture for the frozen-discord phe-\n\nnomenon. The freezing phenomena have been found to\nbe a robust feature of a class of models in the presence\nof non-dissipative decoherence [11, 14, 15]. The model\nof Mazzola et al has also been extended to local nonMarkovian case [14]. The experimental demonstration of\nthis phenomenon have been reported by Xu et al. [16]\nwith optical systems and Auccaise et al [17] using NMR.\nHowever, previous works mainly focused on the quantum\ndiscord based on Ref. [3, 4] and thus were restricted to\nsome special cases such as Bell-diagonal states. It has\nbeen shown that the quantum discord and GMQD do\nnot necessarily imply the same ordering of two-qubit Xstates [18\u201321]. More recently, Girolami and Adesso [22]\nand independently Batle et al. [23] provided a numerical evidence, from which one can infer that there exist\nother states violating the states ordering with quantum\ndiscords. It is thus worth investigating the freezing phenomena with GMQD. In this paper we consider the two\nqubits initially in arbitrary X-states in the presence of local dephasing noises, and we derive the conditions for the\nfreezing phenomenon in terms of GMQD. We also consider the non-Markovian dephasing case and find that\nour results also hold for the non-Markovian dephasing\nprocess. The fact that, under certain conditions, GMQD\nremains unchanged under the phase damping noise for\nsome period of time may have potential applications in\nfuture quantum information tasks.\nBefore describing the main results of this paper, let us\nbriefly review the method to compute GMQD. An arbitrary two-qubit state can be written in Bloch representation:\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n3\n3\nX\nX\n1\uf8f0\nRij \u03c3i \u2297 \u03c3j \uf8fb(1)\n(xi \u03c3i \u2297 I + yi I \u2297 \u03c3i ) +\nI\u2297I+\n\u03c1=\n4\ni,j=1\ni\nwhere xi = T r\u03c1 (\u03c3i \u2297 I) , yi = T r\u03c1 (I \u2297 \u03c3i ) are components of the local Bloch vectors, \u03c3i , i \u2208 {1, 2, 3} are the\nthree Pauli matrices, and Rij = T r\u03c1 (\u03c3i \u2297 \u03c3j ) are components of the correlation tensor. For two-qubit case,\nthe zero-discord state is of the form \u03c7 = p1 |\u03c81 i h\u03c81 | \u2297\n\u03c11 + p2 |\u03c82 i h\u03c82 | \u2297 \u03c12 , where {|\u03c81 i , |\u03c82 i} is a single-qubit\northonormal basis. Then a analytic expression of the\nGMQD is given by [5]\n\n\f2\n\n\u0011\n1\u0010\n2\n2\ng\nkxk + kRk \u2212 kmax\nDA\n(\u03c1) =\n4\n\n(2)\n\nT\n\nwhere x = (x1 , x2 , x3 ) and kmax is the largest eigenvalue\nof matrix K = xxT + RRT . By introducing a matric R\ndefined by\n\nR=\n\n\u0012\n\n1 yT\nx R\n\n\u0013\n\n(3)\n\nand 3 \u00d7 4 matric R\u2032 through deleting the first row of\nR, the analytical expression of GMQD can be further\nrewritten as [24]\n\ng\nDA\n\n1\n(\u03c1) =\n4\n\n\"\n\nX\nk\n\n\u03bb2k\n\n!\n\n\u2212 max \u03bb2k\nk\n\n#\n\n\u03c1X\n\n\u03c111 0 0\n\uf8ec 0 \u03c122 \u03c123\n=\uf8ed\n0 \u03c132 \u03c133\n\u03c141 0 0\n\n\uf8f6\n\u03c114\n0 \uf8f7\n0 \uf8f8\n\u03c144\n\nTheorem: Consider arbitrary X-states defined in\nEq.(5), with each qubit being subject to the local phase\ndamping noises. The necessary and sufficient conditions\nfor the freezing phenomena of GMQD are:\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03bbk is the singular values of R\u2032 . In the following\ndiscussions we use Eq.(4) to calculate GMQD. Suppose\nthe initial state is prepared in arbitrary two-qubit Xstates with the general form\n\uf8eb\n\nwhere we have chosen the computational basis\n{|00i , |01i , |10i , |11i}. Eq.(5) is a 7-real parameter state\nwith three real parameters along the main diagonal and\ntwo complex parameters at off-diagonal positions. A remarkable aspect of the X-states is that the initial X structure is preserved during the decoherence process, thus, it\nis convenient to get analytical results. To get analytical\nresults generally, we use GMQD to quantify the quantum\ncorrelation contained in the X-states and our results are\nsummarized as the following theorem:\n\n(5)\n\n|\u03c114 | = |\u03c123 | ,\n\n2\n\n2\n\n8 |\u03c114 \u03c123 | > (\u03c111 \u2212 \u03c133 ) + (\u03c122 \u2212 \u03c144 )\n\nProof. First we notice that the X-states defined in\nEq.(5) can be rewritten in the Bloch representation with\nthe correlation matrix R given by\n\n\uf8f6\n\u03c114 + \u03c123 + \u03c132 + \u03c141 i(\u03c114 \u2212 \u03c123 + \u03c132 \u2212 \u03c141 ) 0\n\uf8f8\nR = \uf8ed i(\u03c114 + \u03c123 \u2212 \u03c132 \u2212 \u03c141 ) \u2212\u03c114 + \u03c123 + \u03c132 \u2212 \u03c141 0\n0\n0\n\u03c111 \u2212 \u03c122 \u2212 \u03c133 + \u03c144\n\uf8eb\n\nand x = (0, 0, \u03c111 + \u03c122 \u2212 \u03c133 \u2212 \u03c144 )T . Thus the GMQD\ncan be calculated according to Eq.(4)\nwhich\u0001is given by\n\b\nDAg (\u03c1) = 41 \u03bb21 + \u03bb22 + \u03bb23 \u2212 max \u03bb21 , \u03bb22 , \u03bb23 , where\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u03bb21 = 4 |\u03c114 |2 + |\u03c123 |2 + 8 |\u03c114 \u03c123 |\n\u0011\n\u0010\n2\n2\n\u03bb22 = 4 |\u03c114 | + |\u03c123 | \u2212 8 |\u03c114 \u03c123 |\ni\nh\n2\n2\n\u03bb23 = 2 (\u03c111 \u2212 \u03c133 ) + (\u03c122 \u2212 \u03c144 )\n\n(8)\n\nWe suppose the X-states is subjected to two local Markovian phase damping noises formulated via its\nKraus representation\nas[25, 26] I (\u03c1) = E1 \u03c1E1\u2020 + E2 \u03c1E2\u2020 ,\n\u221a\n\u221a\nwith E1 = 1 \u2212 p |1i h1|, and E2 = |0i h0| + p |1i h1|.\nThe parameter p ranges from 0 to 1. The phase damping\nnoises will affect the off-diagonal elements while the diagonal elements remain unchanged. In order to exhibit a\nfreezing phenomenon, the GMQD of the X-states should\nnot contain the parameter p after subjected to the phase\n\n(6)\n\n(7)\n\ndamping nosies. If |\u03c114 \u03c123 | 6= 0, then \u03bb21 > \u03bb22 . According to the formula of GMQD, it is directly to see that\nthe condition of GMQD remain unaffected is given by\n\u03bb22 = 0 and \u03bb21 > \u03bb23 . Combined with these conditions,\nthe theorem is proved.\n\u0004\nIn order to show the application of our theorem we\nconsider \u0014a subclass of two qubit X-states given by \u0015\n3\nP\n\u03c7 = 41 I \u2297 I + r * \u03c3 \u2297 I + I \u2297 s * \u03c3 +\nci \u03c3i \u2297 \u03c3i\ni=1\n\nwhere we choose the Bloch vectors in z direction with\nr = (0, 0, r),s = (0, 0, s). According to Eq.(6), the condition becomes c21 = 0, c22 > r2 + c23 or c22 = 0, c21 > r2 + c23\nwhich reduces to the result presented in Ref.[27]. For\nfixed parameters r and s, the above inequalities become\na two-parameter set, whose geometry can be depicted.\nCombined with the positivity condition of the eigenvalues of the density matrix \u03c7 we can depict the possible\nregion of the mixed state. In Fig.1 we plot the physical\nregion with different r and s, respectively. If r = s = 0,\nthe mixed state reduces to the two-qubit Bell-diagonal\n\n\f3\n\nc3\n\nc3\n\nc2\n\n(a)\n\nc2\n\n(b)\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online).

This process is non-Markovian according to the measure of non-Markovianity of Ref.[29].\nUsing the above Kraus decomposition we obtain the\nparameters of ci of the Bell-diagonal states evolve as:\n2\n2\nc3 (t) = c3 , c1 (t) = c1 \u039b (\u03bd) , c2 (t) = c2 \u039b (\u03bd) , where we\nhave chosen the phase flip channel(which means i = 3)\ncase and similar results can be found for bit flip and bit\nphase flip channels. For fixed ci we plot the dynamic behavior of GMQD in Fig.2. In this case, it is shown that\nthe frozen phenomenon appear two times in contrast to\nMarkovian case where the frozen phenomenon appears\nonly one time [10].\nIn summary, we have investigated the dynamics of\nGMQD for X-states under the local dephasing noises.\nWe derived the necessary and sufficient conditions for\nfreezing phenomenon in terms of GMQD. We also considered the non-Markovian dephasing case and that our\nresults can also be applied to the non-Markovian dephasing process. Compared with the work in Ref.[30], our\nresult provides a different perspective from the geometric measure. In particular, it holds for the more general\ncase which does not restricted to the Bell-diagonal states.\nAn open question is whether there exist other classes of\nmixed states exhibiting the frozen phenomenon in terms\nof GMQD. The future study involves exploring potential\napplications to exploit the class of initial states exhibiting\nfrozen phenomenon in future quantum information tasks\nwithout any disturbance from the noisy environment.\n\ndemodel presented by Daffer et al [28], where \u03c3i\nnote the Pauli operators in direction i acting on A(B).\n\nThis work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No.10905024,\nNo.11374085, No.11204061, No.61073048, the Key\nProject of Chinese Ministry of Education under Grant\nNo.211080, and the Key Program of the Education Department of Anhui Province under Grant\nNo.KJ2011A243, No.KJ2012A244.\n\n[1] A.
