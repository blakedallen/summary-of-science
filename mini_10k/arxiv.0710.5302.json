Among these relations, an important one is the Amati\nrelation that is a correlation between the total isotropic-equivalent radiated energy in \u03b3-ray (E\u03b3,iso ) of longduration GRBs (LGRBs) and their peak energy (Ep ) of integrated \u03bdF\u03bd spectrum in the rest frame (Amati et\nal. 2002). This correlation is further confirmed and extended by subsequent observations (e.g., Amati 2003,\n2006a,b; Sakamoto et al. 2004; Lamb et al. 2004). A similar relation between Liso and Ep is found to be\nnot only hold among different LGRBs but also hold among individual pulses of single LGRB (Liang et al.\n2004). Although the correlation is highly significant, the dispersion of the correlation is expected to be not\nonly caused by statistic fluctuation (e.g., Amati 2006a).\nAt present, LGRBs are generally believed to originate from the death of young massive stars (e.g., see\nWoosley & Bloom (2006) for a recent review). The popular collapsar model favors progenitors with low\nmetallicity to preserve angular momentum when the collapse occurs (e.g., Woosley 1993; MacFadyen &\nWoosley 1999). A low metallicity environment has been indeed reported by the studies of host galaxies of\nboth nearby and cosmologically distant LGRBs (e.g., Sollerman et al. 2005; Stanek et al. 2006; Fynbo et\nal. 2006). Because metal abundance plays an important role in the collapsar model, the evolution of the\nstatistical properties of LGRB is therefore expected.\nLi (2007) recently examined the cosmological evolution of the Amati relation by dividing 48 LGRBs\nwith reported Eiso and Ep into four redshift bins. The Amati relation is found to vary with redshift with\nonly \u223c4% of chance that the variation is caused by selection effect. Although it is generally believed that\nmetallicity statistically evolves strongly with redshift, a number of extremely metal-poor galaxies, have\nbeen identified in the local Universe (e.g., Kewley et al., 2007; Izotov et al., 2006 and references therein).\nSince the metallicity is hard to be determined for a large sample of LGRBs at current, the luminosity (or\nstellar mass) of host galaxy could be used as a physically meaningful indicator of metallicity taking into\naccount of the well established luminosity (or mass)-metallicity relationship (L \u2212 Z relation, e.g., Tremonti\net al., 2004; Savaglio et al. 2005). In this paper, we examine the variation of the Amati relation on luminosity\nof LGRB's host galaxy.\n\u22c6 E-mail: wj@bao.ac.cn\n\n\f2\n\nJ. Wang et al\n\n2 VARIATION OF AMATI RELATION ON LUMINOSITY OF HOST GALAXY\nWe compile a sample of LGRBs to examine whether the Amati relation varies with luminosity of host\ngalaxy. The B-band luminosities of host galaxies are adopted from published literature, and is transformed to absolute B-band magnitude by adopting MB\u22c6 = \u221221 mag. In order to avoid the selection\neffect, only the LGRBs with 0.2 < z < 2 are considered, which leads the four nearby bursts, i.e.,\nGRB 980425, GRB 030329, GRB 031203 and GRB 060218, are excluded from our sample. GRB 980425\nis a sub-energetic LGRB and dose not found to satisfy the Amati relation. GRB 031203 has poorly determined Ep . The sample finally contains 24 LGRBs listed in Amati (2006). Table 1 lists the properties for\neach LGRB, including the redshift, rest-frame isotropic energy E\u03b3,iso defined in 1-1000keV band, peak\nenergy Ep in rest-frame, and k-corrected absolute B-band magnitude MB of its host galaxy. The \u039bCDM\ncosmology with \u03a9m = 0.3, \u03a9\u039b = 0.7 and h0 = 0.7 is adopted throughout the paper.\nThe redshift is plotted against MB for our sample in Figure 1 (left-bottom panel). The diagram indicates\nthat there is no clear trend of MB on redshift in the range from z = 0.2 to z = 2. The Figure 1 upper panel\nshows the distribution of MB of the 24 LGRBs. The MB spans a range of \u221216 - \u221222 mag. In order to\nexamine variation of the Amati relation on luminosity of LGRB's host, we separate the sample into two\nsubgroups with identical contents, i.e., Group L and H, according to the luminosity of LGRB's host galaxy.\nThe LGRBs with MB > \u221219.7 belong to Group L, and these with MB \u2264 \u221219.7 Group H (see vertical\ndashed line in Figure 1). Finally, each group contains 12 LGRBs. The bottom-right panel of Figure 1 shows\nthe distributions of redshift for both subgroups (solid line for Group H and dashed line for Group L). In\nboth subgroups, a majority of LGRBs are distributed in a narrow range from z = 0.5 to 1. A logrank test\nindicates that the redshift distributions of the two subgroups are drawn from the same parent population at\na probability \u223c 70%.\nUsing 41 LGRBs with firmly determined E\u03b3,iso and Ep , Amati (2006) obtained an updated relationship\nlog E\u03b3,iso = a + b log Ep\n\n(1)\n\nwhere a = \u22123.35 and b = 1.75 using the least squares fitting method; and a = \u22124.04 and b = 2.04 using\nthe maximum likelihood method. A least squares fit to our 24 LGRBs as a single sample with Eq. (1) leads\nto a = \u22123.25 \u00b1 0.40 and b = 1.69 \u00b1 0.16 with \u03c72r = 1.60. The \u03c72r is the reduced \u03c72 , which is defined as the\n\u03c72 of fit divided by the degree of freedom. The fitting is shown in Panel A in Figure 2. The two dashed lines\nin the Panel A mark the 1\u03c3 deviation of the best fit. This result is in good agreement with that obtained by\nAmati (2006) and Li (2007), which indicates that no additional bias is obviously introduced in the sample\nused in this paper by our sample selection.\nLeast squares fittings are also carried out for both Group H and L. The fittings are shown in Panel B\nand C in Figure 2 for Group H and L, respectively. In Group H, the best-fit Amati relation has parameters\na = \u22122.97 \u00b1 0.73 and b = 1.61 \u00b1 0.30 (with \u03c72r = 1.96), which is similar to a = \u22123.47 \u00b1 0.44 and\nb = 1.74 \u00b1 0.17 (with \u03c72r = 0.94) obtained in Group L within uncertainties. In addition to the best fit\nof the Amati relation, the dispersion around the best fit also provides important information. Although the\ndispersion of Group H is slightly larger than that of the whole sample, the dispersion of Group L is found\nto be significantly suppressed (see also the \u03c72r for each group). Figure 3 plots the distributions of deviation\nfrom the best fit in log E\u03b3,iso . The distribution for the whole sample, Group H and Group L is shown in\nPanel A, B and C, respectively. As shown in the Panel C, the distribution of Group L is quite uniform with\nan obvious cut-off at \u223c0.6. In contrast, Group H shows a relatively wider distribution with a clear peak at\n\u223c0.5. The difference in distribution of dispersion confirms the separation of the 24 LGRBs into the two\nsubgroups, although the origin of the difference is out of the scope of this paper.\n3 DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY\nThe distributions of log E\u03b3,iso for both subgroups are shown in right-bottom panel in Figure 2. The symbols are the same as that in the right panel of Figure 1. Both subgroups have similar dynamical range of\nlog E\u03b3,iso , a sub-luminous LGRB (GRB 020903) is, however, only found in Group L. The Amati relation\nis also fitted through Eq. (1) after excluding the sub-luminous GRB 020903 from Group L. We obtain a\nrelation with a = \u22123.48 \u00b1 0.96 and b = 1.74 \u00b1 0.36 (\u03c72r = 1.33), which confirms the consistence of our\nfitting.\n\n\fDoes Amati Relation Depend on Host's Luminosity\n\n3\n\nThe L \u2212 Z relation has been firmly established in the local Universe (z < 1) base upon various\nspectroscopic surveys (e.g., Tremonti et al. 2004; Savaglio et al. 2005; Liang et al. 2006). The L \u2212 Z\nrelation indicates that, in general, high metallicity is found in luminous galaxies, and low metallicity in\nfaint galaxies. Tremonti et al. (2004) obtained a relationship 12 + log(O/H) = \u22120.185MB + 5.238 with\na typical scatter of \u03c312+log(O/H) = 0.16 from SDSS. The existent observations indicate that local LGRBs'\nhost galaxies are not far from the L \u2212 Z relation (e.g., Savaglio et al. 2006). The median value of absolute\nmagnitude is MB = \u221220.35 mag for Group H, and -18.55 mag for Group L. According to the relationship\nderived by Tremonti et al. (2004), the difference of metallicity is inferred to be 0.33 dex which is two times\nlarger than the dispersion of the L \u2212 Z relation. Recent observations revealed an evolution of the zero\npoint of the L \u2212 Z relation from local Universe to intermediate redshift z = 1. Different evolution are,\nhowever, found by various authors. For instance, Liang et al. (2006) found an evolution of 0.3 dex since\nz = 0.65, while a much more moderate evolution of 0.14 dex is reported by Kobulnicky & Kewley (2004).\nIn current study, the cosmological evolution is not a key issue because a majority of LGRBs in both two\nsub-groups are uniformly distributed in a relatively narrow dynamical range of redshift (from z = 0.5 to\nz = 1, see Figure 1). According to these existent observations, the consistence of the Amati relations for\ndifferent luminosity of host galaxy implies that the Amati relation has no strong evolution with metallicity\nof LGRB's environment.\nIn the generally accepted fireball model, the Amati relation could be explained by the standard internal\nshock scenario, Ep \u221d \u0393\u22122 L1/2 t\u22121\nvar , where \u0393 is the fireball bulk Lorentz factor, L is the GRB luminosity\nand tvar is the typical variability time scale (e.g., Zhang & M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros 2002; Rees & M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros 2005; Ryde\n2005). The agreement of the Amati relations in the two subgroups would consequently require that both \u0393\nand tvar are approximately independent on environment metallicity. An alternative explanation of the Amati\nrelation is the thermal radiation from photosphere of GRB (e.g, Rees & M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros 2005; Thompson 2006;\n\u22121/2\n\u22121/4 1/2\nE\u03b3,iso , where R0 is the radius\nThompson et al. 2007). In such a context, one expects Ep \u221d R0 \u2206tj\nof complete thermalization. Such radius is reasonably assumed to be comparable or less than the radius\nof core of the progenitor. Because of the weak dependence on the duration of prompt emission, the slope\nof the Amati relation primarily depends on the radius. Our test therefore implies a similar core radius of\nprogenitor in both subgroups.\nThe result obtained in this paper differs from that in Li (2007). Li (2007) found the variation of the\nAmati relation by separating the whole sample into four groups according to redshift. However, various\nselection bias should be carefully considered in such study. In stead of the Ep -E\u03b3,iso relation, a much lower\ndispersion is found in the Ep -E\u03b3 relation by correcting for collimation angles of jet (Ghirlanda et al. 2004;\n2007). The different slope between the Ep -E\u03b3,iso and Ep -E\u03b3 relation leads to a hypothesis that powerful\nbursts intrinsically have smaller opening angles (Ghirlanda et al. 2005). Assuming the Ep -E\u03b3 relation is\nintrinsic for all LGRBs, the dependence of opening angle on burst energy could be a possible explanation\nof the decrease of slope of the Amati relation with redshift, because sub-luminous bursts have been only\ndetected in local Universe by now.\nAs done in Ghirlanda et al. (2005), assuming the Ep -E\u03b3 relation is intrinsic for all the LGRBs, it is\npossible to compare the properties of the burst environment in the two subgroups. So far, the uncertainties\nof burst environment have not been considered in the previous studies on the Ep -E\u03b3 relation. Moreover,\nthe properties of the circumburst medium could provide some insight about the energy source of LGRB.\nThe model of LGRB's afterglow lighcurves indicates that a homogeneous medium is more favored than a\nwind like r\u22122 radial stratification (e.g, Panaitescu 2005; and recently summarized in Fryer et al. 2007). The\nobserved homogeneous medium could be explained by either termination shock of wind (Wijers 2001) or\nbubbles with uniform density produced in intense starburst region (Chevalier et al. 2004).\nIn the homogeneous case, the density is (Sari 1999)\nn=\n\nE\u03b3,iso,52\n\u03b7\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03b8j\n0.161\n\n\u00138 \u0012\n\ntj\n1+z\n\n\u0013\u22123\n\ncm\u22123\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03b8j is the opening angle of jet, \u03b7 is the radiation efficiency which is usually assumed to be the same\nfor all bursts, \u03b7 = 0.2 (Frail et al. 2001) and tj is the break time in units of day of the afterglow light curve.\nThe estimated density is shown in Column (7) in Table 1 for the 11 LGRBs with firm estimates of jet break\n\n\f4\n\nJ.

The measured density roughly extends from 1 to 10 cm\u22123 (e.g., Frail et al. 2001;\nPanaitescu & Kumar 2002; Schaefer et al. 2003). Comparing the density between Group H and Group L, it\nis noted that the distribution of density in Group L is roughly concentrated around the value of 2 cm\u22122 . On\nthe contrary, the density spreads wider in Group H than in Group L.\nWe note here that our treatment of binning the sample into two subgroups according to B-band luminosity of host galaxies is more or less simplified. The B-band luminosity is not a perfect indicator of stellar\nmass (or metallicity) because it suffers from extinction and traces mass of only massive stars. More accurate\ntreatment of binning and direct measurement of metallicity are required to accurately test the evolution of\nthe Amati relation.\nIn summary, we examine the systematics of the Amati relation by dividing the 24 LGRBs into two\nsubgroups according to the absolute B-band magnitudes of their host galaxies. Obvious difference of Amati\nrelations in the two subgroups are not found within uncertainties, although they seem to have different\ndistributions of deviation from the best fit. Combining with the well established luminosity - metallicity\nrelation, current study does not imply strong evolution of the Amati relation with LGRB's environment\nmetallicity.\nAcknowledgements The authors would like to thank the anonymous referee for his/her suggestions and\ncomments on the manuscript.
