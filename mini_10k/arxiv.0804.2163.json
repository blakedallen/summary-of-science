The initial singularity, the flatness and horizon problems [1] point out that Standard Cosmological\nModel [2], based on General Relativity (GR) and Particle Standard Model, fails in describing the Universe at extreme\nregimes. Besides, GR does not work as a fundamental theory capable of giving a quantum description of spacetime.\nDue to these reasons and to the lack of a definitive Quantum Gravity theory, alternative theories of gravitation have\nbeen pursued in order to attempt, at least, a semi-classical approach to quantization. In particular, Extended Theories\nof Gravity (ETGs) face the problem of gravitational interaction correcting and enlarging the Einstein theory.\nThe general paradigm consists in adding, into the effective action, physically motivated higher-order curvature\ninvariants and non-minimally coupled scalar fields [3, 4].\nThe interest of such an approach in early epoch cosmology is due to the fact that ETGs can \"naturally\" reproduce\ninflationary behaviors able to overcome the shortcomings of the Standard Cosmological Model and seems also capable\nof matching with several observations.\nFrom another viewpoint, the Mach Principle gives further motivations to modify GR stating that the local inertial\nframe is determined by the average motion of distant astronomical objects [5]. As a consequence, the gravitational\ncoupling can be scale-dependent. This means that the concept of inertia and the Equivalence Principle have to be\nrevised since there is no a priori reason to restrict the gravitational Lagrangian to a linear function of the Ricci scalar\nR, minimally coupled with matter [6\u201311].\nVery recently, ETGs are playing an interesting role to describe today's observed Universe. In fact, the impressive\namount of good quality data of last decade seems to shed new light into the effective picture of the Universe. Type\nIa Supernovae (SNeIa) [12], anisotropies in the CMBR [13], and matter power spectrum derived from wide and deep\ngalaxy surveys [14] represent the strongest evidences for a radical revision of the Cosmological Standard Model also\nat recent epochs.\nSpecifically, the Concordance \u039bCDM Model is showing that baryons contribute only for \u223c 4% to the total matter energy budget, while the cold dark matter (CDM) represents the bulk of the clustered large scale structures (\u223c 25%)\nand the cosmological constant \u039b plays the role of the so called \"dark energy\" (\u223c 70%) [15].\nAlthough being the best fit to a wide range of data [16], the \u039bCDM model is affected by strong theoretical\nshortcomings [17] that have motivated the search for alternative models [18, 19].\nDark energy models mainly rely on the implicit assumption that Einstein's GR is the correct theory of gravity\nindeed. Nevertheless, its validity on large astrophysical and cosmological scales has never been tested but only\nassumed [20], and it is therefore conceivable that both cosmic speed up and missing matter are nothing else but\n\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\ne - mail address: capozziello@na.infn.it\ne - mail address: antonio.defelice@uclouvain.be\n\n\f2\nsignals of a breakdown of GR. In this sense, GR could fail in giving self-consistent pictures both at ultraviolet scales\n(early universe) and at infrared scales (late universe).\nFollowing this line of thinking, the \"minimal\" choice could be to take into account generic functions f (R) of the\nRicci scalar R. However, such an approach can be encompassed in the ETGs being the minimal extension of GR.\nThe task for this extended theories should be to match the data under the \"economic\" requirement that no exotic\ndark ingredients have to be added, unless these are going to be found with fundamental experiments [21]. This is the\nunderlying philosophy of what are referred to as f (R)-gravity (see [19, 22, 23] and references therein).\nAlthough higher order gravity theories have received much attention in cosmology, since they are naturally able to\ngive rise to the accelerating expansion (both in the late and in the early universe [24]), it is possible to demonstrate\nthat f (R) theories can also play a major role at astrophysical scales. In fact, modifying the gravity Lagrangian affects\nthe gravitational potential in the low energy limit. Provided that the modified potential reduces to the Newtonian\none on the Solar System scale, this implication could represent an intriguing opportunity rather than a shortcoming\nfor f (R) theories. In fact, a corrected gravitational potential could offer the possibility to fit galaxy rotation curves\nwithout the need of huge amounts of dark matter [25\u201331]. In addition, it is possible to work out a formal analogy\nbetween the corrections to the Newtonian potential and the usually adopted galaxy halo models which allow to\nreproduce dynamics and observation without dark matter [27].\nHowever, extending the gravitational Lagrangian could give rise to several problems. These theories could have\ninstabilities [32, 33] and ghost - like behaviors [34\u201336], and they have to be matched with the low energy limit experiments which fairly test GR. Besides, these theories should also be compatible with early universe tests such as the\nformation of CMBR anisotropies, Big Bang Nucleosynthesis [37], and Baryogenesis [38, 39].\nActually, the debate concerning the weak field limit of f (R)-gravity is far to be definitive. In the last few years, several authors have dealt with this matter with contrasting conclusions, in particular with respect to the Parameterized\nPost Newtonian (PPN) limit [40, 42].\nIn summary, it seems that the paradigm to adopt f (R)-gravity leads to interesting results at cosmological, galactic\nand Solar System scales but, up to now, no definite physical criterion has been found to select the final f (R) theory\n(or class of theories) capable of matching the data at all scales. Interesting results have been achieved in this line of\nthinking [21, 43\u201346] but the approaches are all phenomenological and are not based on some fundamental principle\nas the conservation or the invariance of some quantity or some intrinsic symmetry of the theory. Furthermore, as it\nwas shown in [32], in alternative theories of gravity, it is important to understand the background before exploring\nother bounds, such as anisotropies in the CMBR. For this goal it is essential to try to find exact analytical solutions\nfor the f (R) theories, and, only after this, study more in detail the possible evolutions compatible with our data (e.g.\nsolar system and CMBR bounds).\nIn some sense, the situation is similar to that of dark matter: we know very well its effect at large astrophysical\nscales but no final evidence of its existence has been found, up to now, at fundamental level. In the case of f (R)gravity, we know that the paradigm is working: in principle, the missing matter and accelerated cosmic behavior can\nbe addressed taking into account gravity (in some extended version), baryons and radiation but we do not know a\nspecific criterion to select the final, comprehensive theory.\nIn this paper, we want to address the following issues: i) Is there some general principle capable of selecting\nphysically motivated f (R) models? ii) Can conserved quantities or symmetries be found in relation to specific f (R)\ntheories? iii) Can such quantities, if existing, give rise to viable cosmological models?\nIn this paper, following the so called Noether Symmetry Approach (see [7, 47, 48], we want to seek for viable f (R)\ncosmological models. As we will see, the method is twofold: from one side, the existence of symmetries allows to solve\nexactly the dynamics; from the other side, the Noether charge can always be related to some observable quantity.\nThe layout of the paper is the following. In Sec.II, we sketch the dynamics of f (R) gravity in the metric approach\nand derive the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmological equations. Sec.III is devoted to the\ngeneral discussion of the Noether Symmetry Approach by which it is possible to find out conserved quantities and\nthen symmetries which allow to exactly solve a dynamical system. In Sec.IV, we apply the method to the f (R)\ncosmology. In Sec.V, we give a detailed summary of the exact solutions discussing them in presence or in absence of\nthe Noether charge. Sec.VI is devoted to the discussion and the conclusions.\nII.\n\nf (R) GRAVITY AND COSMOLOGY\n\nThe action\nS=\n\nZ\n\nd4 x\n\n\u221a\n\n\u2212g f (R) + Sm ,\n\n(1)\n\n\f3\ndescribes a theory of gravity where f (R) is a generic function of the Ricci scalar R. GR is recovered in the particular\ncase f (R) = \u2212R/16\u03c0G, and Sm is the action for a perfect fluid minimally coupled with gravity 1 .\nThis action, in general, leads to 4th order differential equations for the metric since the field equations are\nfR R\u03bc\u03bd \u2212\n\n1\n2\n\nm\nf g\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 fR;\u03bc\u03bd + g\u03bc\u03bd \u0003fR = \u2212 21 T\u03bc\u03bd\n,\n\n(2)\n\nm\nwhere a subscript R denotes differentiation with respect to R and T\u03bc\u03bd\nis the matter fluid stress-energy tensor.\nDefining a curvature stress - energy tensor as\n\u001a\n\u001b\n1\n1\ncurv\ng\u03bc\u03bd [f (R) \u2212 RfR (R)] + fR (R);\u03b1\u03b2 (g\u03b1\u03bc g\u03b2\u03bd \u2212 g\u03bc\u03bd g\u03b1\u03b2 ) ,\nT\u03bc\u03bd\n=\nfR (R) 2\n\n(3)\n\nEqs.(2) can be recast in the Einstein - like form :\n1\ncurv\nm\nG\u03bc\u03bd = R\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 g\u03bc\u03bd R = T\u03bc\u03bd\n+ T\u03bc\u03bd\n/fR (R)\n2\n\n(4)\n\nwhere matter non - minimally couples to geometry through the term 1/fR (R). It is known that these theories can be\nmapped to a scalar-tensor theory. However, there are two points which should be noticed. First, the two theories\nmight have different quantum descriptions, as they only coincide on the classical solutions. Furthermore, the two\ntheories are classically equivalent if the Brans-Dicke parameter (\u03c9BD ) exactly vanishes and if the scalar field possesses\na suitable potential. This fact is related to the second point: in the literature, the Brans-Dicke field is commonly\ntaken as a light scalar field for which the local gravity constraint fixes the Brans-Dicke parameter to be greater than\n40000. This bound is usually considered when studying Brans-Dicke theories. However, for the f (R) theories, since\n\u03c9BD = 0, this is not the case, and the presence of a non-negligible potential is essential in order to give an explicit\nmass to the gravitational scalar degree of freedom. Once one has the solution H(t) \u0001(and consequently R(t))\u0001 for a\ngiven f (R), the scalar field is defined as \u03a6(t) = \u2212fR (t), and its potential is U \u03a6(t) = R(t) fR (t) \u2212 f R(t) . An\nexample showing this link between scalar-tensor theories and f (R) gravity is given in the appendix for one solution\nwhich will be found explicitly later on.\nIn order to derive the cosmological equations in a FLRW metric, one can define a canonical Lagrangian L =\nL(a, \u0227, R, \u1e58), where Q = {a, R} is the configuration space and T Q = {a, \u0227, R, \u1e58} is the related tangent bundle\non which L is defined. The variable a(t) and R(t) are the scale factor and the Ricci scalar in the FLRW metric,\nrespectively. One can use the method of the Lagrange multipliers to set R as a constraint of the dynamics. Selecting\nthe suitable Lagrange multiplier and integrating by parts, the Lagrangian L becomes canonical. In our case, we have\nS = 2\u03c0 2\n\nZ\n\n\u0013\u0015\n\u001b\n\u001a\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u03c1m0\n\u03ba\n\u03c1r0\n\u00e4 \u02272\n\u2212 3 \u2212 4 ,\n+ 2+ 2\ndt a3 f (R) \u2212 \u03bb R + 6\na a\na\na\na\n\n(5)\n\nwhere a is the scale factor scaled with respect to today's value (so that a = \u00e3/\u00e30 and a(t0 ) = 1); \u03c1m0 and \u03c1r0 represent\nthe standard amounts of dust and radiation fluids as, for example, measured today; finally \u03ba = k/\u00e320 , where k = 0, \u00b11.\nThis choice for a, makes it dimensionless, and it also implies that [\u03ba] = [R] = M 2 , whereas [f ] = [\u03c1r0 ] = M 4 . It is\nstraightforward to show that, for f (R) = \u2212R/16\u03c0G \u2212 \u03c1\u039b0 , one obtains the usual Friedmann equations.\nThe variation with respect to R of the action gives \u03bb = fR .

Considering R and a as the variables, we have, for consistency (excluding\nthe case fRR = 0), that R coincides with the definition of the Ricci scalar in the FLRW metric. Geometrically, this is\nthe Euler constraint of the dynamics. Using (10), only one of the equations (8), and (11) is independent because of\nthe Bianchi identities, as these equations correspond to the first and second modified Einstein equations, and matter\nis conserved. Equivalently, after multiplying equation (11) by a2 \u0227, and using (10), one can integrate (11) to find (8).\nFurthermore, as we will show below, constraints on the form of the function f (R) and, consequently, solutions of the\nsystem (8), (10) can be achieved by asking for the existence of Noether symmetries. Such solutions will also solve\nequation (11) automatically. On the other hand, the existence of the Noether symmetries guarantees the reduction\nof dynamics and the eventual solvability of the system.\nIII.\n\nTHE NOETHER SYMMETRY APPROACH\n\nSolutions for the dynamics given by (7) can be achieved by selecting cyclic variables related to some Noether\nsymmetry. In principle, this approach allows to select f (R)-gravity models compatible with the symmetry so it can\nbe seen as a physical criterion since the conserved quantities are a sort of Noether charges. Therefore such a criterion\nmight be to look for those f (R) which have cosmological Noether charge. Although this criterion somehow \"breaks\"\nLorentz-invariance because we need the FLRW background to formulate it, however Lorentz-invariance is evidently\nbroken in our universe by the presence of the CBMR radiation which, by itself, fixes a preferred reference frame.\nIn general, the Noether Theorem states that conserved quantities are related to the existence of cyclic variables\ninto dynamics [49\u201351].\nLet L(q i , q\u0307 i ) be a canonical, non-degenerate point-like Lagrangian where\n\u2202L\n= 0;\n\u2202\u03bb\n\ndef\n\ndetHij = det\n\n\u22022L\n\u2202 q\u0307 i \u2202 q\u0307 j\n\n6= 0 ,\n\n(12)\n\nwith Hij the Hessian matrix related to L and a dot denotes differentiation with respect to the affine parameter \u03bb.\nThe dot indicates derivatives with respect to the affine parameter \u03bb which, in our case, corresponds to the cosmic\ntime t. In analytical mechanics, L is of the form\nL = T (q, q\u0307) \u2212 V (q) ,\n\n(13)\n\nwhere T and V are the \"kinetic\" and \"potential energy\" respectively. T is a positive definite quadratic form in q\u0307.\nThe energy function associated with L is\nEL \u2261\n\n\u2202L i\nq\u0307 \u2212 L ,\n\u2202 q\u0307 i\n\n(14)\n\nwhich is the total energy T + V . In any case, EL is a constant of motion. Since our cosmological problem has a finite\nnumber of degrees of freedom, we are going to consider only point-transformations. Any invertible transformation of\nthe \"generalized positions\" Qi = Qi (q) induces a transformation of the \"generalized velocities\" such that\nQ\u0307i (q) =\n\n\u2202Qi j\nq\u0307 ;\n\u2202q j\n\n(15)\n\n\f5\nthe matrix J = ||\u2202Qi /\u2202q j || is the Jacobian of the transformation on the positions, and it is assumed to be nonzero.\nThe Jacobian Je of the induced transformation is easily derived and J =\n6 0 \u2192 Je =\n6 0. In general, this condition is not\nsatisfied in the whole space but only in the neighbor of a point. It is a local transformation.\nA point transformation Qi = Qi (q) can depend on one (or more than one) parameter. As starting point, we\ncan assume that a point transformation depends on a parameter \u03b5, i.e. Qi = Qi (q, \u03b5), and that it gives rise to a\none-parameter Lie group. For infinitesimal values of \u03b5, the transformation is then generated by a vector field: for\ninstance, \u2202/\u2202x is a translation along the x axis, x(\u2202/\u2202y) \u2212 y(\u2202/\u2202x) is a rotation around the z axis and so on. The\ninduced transformation (15) is then represented by\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202\nd i\n\u2202\nX = \u03b1i (q) i +\n.\n(16)\n\u03b1 (q)\n\u2202q\nd\u03bb\n\u2202 q\u0307 i\nX is called the \"complete lift\" of X [51]. A function F (q, q\u0307) is invariant under the transformation X if\n\u0012\n\u0013\nd i\n\u2202F\n\u2202F\ndef i\n= 0,\n\u03b1 (q)\nLX F = \u03b1 (q) i +\n\u2202q\nd\u03bb\n\u2202 q\u0307 i\n\n(17)\n\nwhere LX F is the Lie derivative of F . Specifically, if LX L = 0, X is a symmetry for the dynamics derived by L.\nAs we shall see later on, we will look for a sufficient condition on the form of f (R) in our Lagrangian, which allows\nLX L = 0 to vanish.\nLet us consider now a Lagrangian L and its Euler-Lagrange equations\n\u2202L\nd \u2202L\n\u2212 j = 0.\nd\u03bb \u2202 q\u0307 j\n\u2202q\nLet us consider also the vector field (16). Contracting (18) with the \u03b1i 's gives\n\u0012\n\u0013\nd \u2202L\n\u2202L\nj\n\u03b1\n\u2212 j = 0.\nd\u03bb \u2202 q\u0307 j\n\u2202q\n\n(18)\n\n(19)\n\nBeing\nd\nd \u2202L\n=\n\u03b1\nj\nd\u03bb \u2202 q\u0307\nd\u03bb\nj\n\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012 j\u0013\n\u2202L\nd\u03b1\nj \u2202L\n,\n\u03b1\n\u2212\nj\n\u2202 q\u0307\nd\u03bb \u2202 q\u0307 j\n\n(20)\n\nfrom (19), we obtain\nd\nd\u03bb\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202L\n\u03b1i i = LX L .\n\u2202 q\u0307\n\n(21)\n\nThe immediate consequence is the Noether Theorem which states:\nIf LX L = 0, then the function\n\u03a30 = \u03b1i\n\n\u2202L\n,\n\u2202 q\u0307 i\n\n(22)\n\nis a constant of motion.\nSome comments are necessary at this point. Eq.(22) can be expressed independently of coordinates as a contraction\nof X by a Cartan one-form\ndef\n\n\u03b8L =\n\n\u2202L i\ndq .\n\u2202 q\u0307 i\n\n(23)\n\nFor a generic vector field Y = y i \u2202/\u2202xi , and one-form \u03b2 = \u03b2i dxi , we have, by definition, iY \u03b2 = y i \u03b2i . Thus Eq.(22)\ncan be written as\ni X \u03b8L = \u03a30 .\n\n(24)\n\nBy a point-transformation, the vector field X becomes\ne = (iX dQk ) \u2202 +\nX\n\u2202Qk\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\nd\n\u2202\n.\n(ix dQk )\nd\u03bb\n\u2202 Q\u0307k\n\n(25)\n\n\f6\ne \u2032 is still the lift of a vector field defined on the \"space of positions.\" If X is a symmetry and we choose\nWe see that X\na point transformation such that\niX dQ1 = 1 ; iX dQi = 0 i 6= 1 ,\n\n(26)\n\nwe get\ne =\nX\n\n\u2202\n;\n\u2202Q1\n\n\u2202L\n=0.\n\u2202Q1\n\n(27)\n\nThus Q1 is a cyclic coordinate and the dynamics results reduced [49, 50].\nFurthermore, the change of coordinates given by (26) is not unique and then a clever choice could be very important.\nIn general, the solution of Eq.(26) is not defined on the whole space. It is local in the sense explained above. Besides,\nit is possible that more than one X is found, e.g. X1 , X2 . If they commute, i.e. [X1 , X2 ] = 0, then it is possible to\nobtain two cyclic coordinates by solving the system\niX1 dQ1 = 1; iX2 dQ2 = 1; iX1 dQi = 0; i 6= 1; iX2 dQi = 0; i 6= 2 .\n\n(28)\n\nThe transformed fields will be \u2202/\u2202Q1 , \u2202/\u2202Q2 . If they do not commute, this procedure is clearly not applicable, since\ncommutation relations are preserved by diffeomorphisms. If the relation X3 = [X1 , X2 ] holds, also X3 is a symmetry,\nbeing LX3 L = LX1 LX2 L \u2212 LX2 LX1 L = 0. If X3 is independent of X1 , X2 , we can go on until the vector fields close\nthe Lie algebra. The usual approach to this situation is to make a Legendre transformation, going to the Hamiltonian\nformalism, and then derive the Lie algebra of Poisson brackets.\nIf we seek for a reduction of dynamics by cyclic coordinates, the procedure is possible in the following way: i) we\narbitrarily choose one of the symmetries, or a linear combination of them, searching for new coordinates where, as\ne\nsketched above, the cyclic variables appear. After the reduction, we get a new Lagrangian \u03bb(Q);\nii) we search again\nfor symmetries in this new configuration space, make a new reduction and so on until possible; iii) if the search fails,\nwe try again by another of the existing symmetries.\nLet us now assume that L is of the form (13). As X is of the form (16), LX L will be a homogeneous polynomial of\nsecond degree in the velocities plus a inhomogeneous term in the q i . Since such a polynomial has to be identically zero,\neach coefficient must be independently zero. If n is the dimension of the configuration space, we get {1 + n(n + 1)/2}\npartial differential equations. The system is overdetermined, therefore, if any solution exists, it will be expressed in\nterms of integration constants instead of boundary conditions. It is also obvious that an overall constant factor in the\nLie vector X is irrelevant. In other words, the Noether Symmetry Approach can be used to select functions which\nassign the models and such functions (and then the models) can be physically relevant.\nConsidering the specific case which we are going to discuss, the f (R) cosmology, the situation is the following. The\nconfiguration space is Q = {a, R} while the tangent space for the related tangent bundle is T Q = {a, \u0227, R, \u1e58}. The\nLagrangian is an application\nL : T Q \u2212\u2192 R\n\n(29)\n\nwhere R is the set of real numbers. The generator of symmetry is\nX=\u03b1\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n+\u03b2\n+ \u03b1\u0307\n+ \u03b2\u0307\n.\n\u2202a\n\u2202R\n\u2202 \u0227\n\u2202 \u1e58\n\n(30)\n\nAs discussed above, a symmetry exists if the equation LX L = 0 has solutions. Then there will be a constant of motion\non shell, i.e. for the solutions of the Euler equations, as stated above equation (22). In other words, a symmetry exists\nif at least one of the functions \u03b1 or \u03b2 in Eq.(30) is different from zero. As a byproduct, the form of f (R), not specified\nin the point-like Lagrangian (7), is determined in correspondence to such a symmetry.\nIV.\n\nNOETHER SYMMETRIES IN f (R) COSMOLOGY\n\nFor the existence of a symmetry, we can write the following system of equations (linear in \u03b1 and \u03b2),\nfR (\u03b1 + 2a \u2202a \u03b1) + a fRR (\u03b2 + a \u2202a \u03b2) = 0\na2 fRR \u2202R \u03b1 = 0\n2 fR \u2202R \u03b1 + fRR (2 \u03b1 + a \u2202a \u03b1 + a \u2202R \u03b2) + a \u03b2 fRRR = 0 ,\n\n(31)\n(32)\n(33)\n\n\f7\nobtained setting to zero the coefficients of the terms \u02272 , \u1e582 and \u0227\u1e58 in LX L = 0. In order to make LX L = 0 vanish\nwe will also look for those particular f 's which, given the Euler dynamics, also satisfy the constraint\n3\u03b1 (f \u2212 R fR ) \u2212 a \u03b2 R fRR \u2212\n\n\u03c1r0 \u03b1\n6\u03ba\n(\u03b1fR + a \u03b2 fRR ) + 4 = 0 .\na2\na\n\n(34)\n\nThis procedure is different from the usual Noether symmetry approach, in the sense that now LX L = 0 will be solved\nnot for all dynamics (which solve the Euler-Lagrange equations), but only for those f which allows Euler solutions\nto solve also the constraint (34). Imposing such a constraint on the form of f will turn out to be, as we will show,\na sufficient condition to find solutions of the Euler-Lagrange equation which also possess a constant of motion, i.e. a\nNoether symmetry. As we shall see later on, the system (31), (32) and (33) can be solved exactly. Having a non-trivial\nsolution for \u03b1 and \u03b2 for this system, one finds a constant of motion if also the constraint (34) is satisfied. In fact, with\nthese \u03b1 and \u03b2, only those Euler-Lagrange solutions which also satisfy equation (34) will have a constant of motion.\nHowever, this will not happen for all f (R)'s. The task will be to find such forms of f .\nA solution of (31), (32) and (33) exists if explicit forms of \u03b1, \u03b2 are found. If, at least one of them is different from\nzero, a Noether symmetry exists.\nIf fRR 6= 0, Eq.(32) can be immediately solved being\n\u03b1 = \u03b1(a) .\n\n(35)\n\nThe case fRR = 0 is trivial since corresponds to the standard GR. We can rewrite Eqs.(31) and (33) as follows\n\u0012\n\u0013\nd\u03b1\nfR \u03b1 + 2a\n+ a fRR (\u03b2 + a \u2202a \u03b2) = 0\n(36)\nda\n\u0012\n\u0013\nd\u03b1\nfRR 2 \u03b1 + a\n+ a \u2202R \u03b2 + a \u03b2 fRRR = 0 .\n(37)\nda\nSince f = f (R), then \u2202f /\u2202a = 0, even in the case we consider R = R(a), it is possible to solve equation (37), by\nwriting it as\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b1 d\u03b1\n(38)\n\u2202R (\u03b2 fRR ) = \u2212fRR 2 +\na\nda\nwhose general solution can be written as\n\u0015\nh(a)\n2\u03b1 d\u03b1 fR\n+\n.\n+\n\u03b2=\u2212\na\nda fRR\nfRR\n\u0014\n\n(39)\n\nTherefore one finds that Eq. (36) gives\nfR\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\nd2 \u03b1\ndh\nd\u03b1\n\u03b1\u2212a\n+a h\u2212a\n= 0,\n\u2212a\nda2\nda\nda\n2\n\n(40)\n\nwhich has solution\n\u03b1 = c1 a +\n\nc2\na\n\nand\n\nh=\n\nc\u0304\n,\na\n\n(41)\n\nwhere, being a dimensionless, c1 and c2 have the same dimensions. We can further fix \u03b1 to be dimensionless, this\nfixes the dimensions of \u03b2 to be [\u03b2] = M 2 . Then also [c\u0304] = M 2 , so that we have\nh\nc\u0304\nc2 i f R\n+\n.\n\u03b2 = \u2212 3 c1 + 2\na fRR\na fRR\n\n(42)\n\nWe can now use the expressions for \u03b1 and \u03b2 into Eq.(34) as follows\n\u0001\nc1 a2 + c2 \u03c1r0\n3 a (c1 a2 + c2 ) f \u2212 c\u0304 (a2 R + 6\u03ba)\n+ 4\n,\nfR =\n2a(c2 R \u2212 6c1 \u03ba)\n2a (c2 R \u2212 6c1 \u03ba)\n\n(43)\n\nif c2 R \u2212 6 \u03ba c1 6= 0. It is clear that, for a general f , it will not be possible to solve at the same time the Euler-Lagrange\nequation and this constraint. Therefore we have to use the Noether constraint in order to find the subset of those\n\n\f8\nlater, it is convenient to look for a parametric solution in the form\n\u0002f which make\u0001\u0003this possible. As we shall see\nH(a), f R(a) . In this case, since fR = f \u2032 /R\u2032 , the Noether condition corresponds to the following ODE\n\u0001\nc1 a2 + c2 \u03c1r0\n3 a (c1 a2 + c2 ) f (a) \u2212 c\u0304 (a2 R(a) + 6\u03ba)\nf \u2032 (a)\n=\n+\n.\n(44)\nR\u2032 (a)\n2a(c2 R(a) \u2212 6c1 \u03ba)\n2a4 (c2 R(a) \u2212 6c1 \u03ba)\nIt should be noted that this change of variable is defined only if R\u2032 6= 0, that is if R is not constant during the evolution.\nWhen this happens Eq. (34) or (45) sets a = a0 = constant, which corresponds to an uninteresting solution.\nAny Euler-Lagrange solution, by definition, satisfies the Einstein equations. However we will show that there are\nforms of f (R), for which a subset of those solution will also be a Noether solution. In fact, Eq.(43) can also be\nrewritten as\nc1 a2 (\u03c1r0 + 3 a4 f + 12 \u03ba a2 fR ) + c2 [\u03c1r0 + a4 (3 f \u2212 2 R fR )] = c\u0304 a3 (a2 R + 6\u03ba) .\n\n(45)\n\nTherefore we look for a family of solutions that, being a Noether symmetry, gives a class of f (R) models.\nThis symmetry implies the existence of the following constant of motion\n\u03b1 (6 fRR a2 \u1e58 + 12 fR a \u0227) + \u03b2 (6 fRR a2 \u0227) = 6 \u03bc30 = constant,\n\n(46)\n\nwhere \u03bc0 has the dimensions of a mass.

Equation (46) can be used to reduce the order of the Friedmann equation.

We will use this relation in order to find out exact cosmological solutions. Namely, we will\nsearch for solutions depending on the constant of motion \u03bc0 determined by the Noether symmetry.\nV.\n\nEXACT COSMOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS\n\nIn order to find out exact cosmological solutions, let us discuss the Noether condition Eq.(45) and the dynamical\nsystem (8),(10) with respect to the values of the integration constants c1,2 , the structural parameters k, \u03c1r0 , \u03c1m0 and\nthe Noether charge \u03bc0 . Beside cosmological solutions, also the explicit form of f (R) will result fixed in the various\ncases. As we shall see later on, analytical solutions can be easily found for the case when both c\u0304 and \u03bc0 vanish at the\nsame time. Therefore in all this section, except one subsection, we will set c\u0304 = 0.\nA.\n\nCase c1 = 0\n\nIn this case, the Noether condition (45) reduces to\n2 R fR \u2212 3 f =\n\n\u03c1r0\n.\na4\n\n(51)\n\n\f9\n1.\n\nVacuum and pure dust case\n\nIn vacuum, or in the presence of dust only, i.e. \u03c1r0 = 0, we find\nf = f0\n\n\u0012\n\nR\nR0\n\n\u00133/2\n\n.\n\n(52)\n\nThis solution, for the vacuum case \u03c1r0 = \u03c1m0 = 0, has been already found [48]. The absence of a ghost imposes that\nfR < 0, i.e. f0 > 0 since R0 < 0. In the case of dust and no radiation (\u03c1m0 6= 0, \u03c1r0 = 0), one can substitute Eq.(52)\ninto (50) to find\n\u0012\n\nR\nR0\n\n\u00133/2\n\n18\u03ba\n+ 2\na R0\n\n\u0012\n\nR\nR0\n\n\u00131/2\n\n=\u2212\n\n2\u03c1m0\n12\u03bc30 H\n\u2212 3 .\nc2 a f 0\na f0\n\n(53)\n\n1. k = 0. In this case, for consistency, we need the right hand side of (53) to be positive. If \u03bc0 = 0 (case for which\nanalytical solutions could be given), this is impossible as f0 > 0, therefore there is no ghost-free solution. For\nthe more general case \u03bc30 /c2 < 0, there could be a physical solution: the non-linearity of the equations does not\nallow us to find analytical solutions for this case. Nevertheless, solutions (to be found numerically) may still\nexist.\n2. k 6= 0. The Ricci scalar can be found as the solution of Eq. (53). For \u03bc0 = 0, we have a cubic equation in\n(R/R0 )1/2 , for which a real solution always exists (which may not be positive though). Looking at equation\n(53), the case \u03bc0 = 0, k = \u22121 has no ghost-free solutions (f0 < 0). Also the case \u03bc0 = 0, k = 1 has no solution,\nbecause we have\n#\n\"\nr\n1/3\nR\n6\u03ba f0 1\nB\u03030\n=\n\u2212 1/3\n,\n(54)\nR0\nf0 R0\na\nB\u0303\n0\n\nwhere we have defined the constant\nB\u03030 =\n\nq\nf04 \u03c12m0 R06 + 216f06 \u03ba3 R03 \u2212 f02 \u03c1m0 R03 ,\n\n(55)\n\nwhich implies that (f0 /\u03c1m0 )2 (\u03ba/R0 )3 > \u22121/216. If so, then, since R0 < 0, B\u03030 > 0. However, this would lead\nto a negative value for (R/R0 )1/2 .\n2.\n\nDust and radiation case\n\nIn this case we have\nfR =\n\n\u03c1r0\n3 f\n+\n.\n2 R 2 a4 R\n\n(56)\n\nOnce again, in order to have fR < 0, and R < 0 during the evolution of the universe one requires\nf >\u2212\n\n\u03c1r0\n.\n3 a4\n\n(57)\n\nIf we substitute the expression for fR into the reduced Friedmann Eq.(50) we find\nf =\u2212\n\n12 \u03bc30 a H R\n6\u03ba \u03c1r0\n3\u03c1r0 R\n2\u03c1m0 R\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n.\nc2 (R a2 + 18\u03ba) a4 (Ra2 + 18\u03ba) a2 (Ra2 + 18\u03ba) a (Ra2 + 18\u03ba)\n\n(58)\n\nThis relation gives f as a function of a being R = R(a). It has to be c2 6= 0 otherwise the Noether condition becomes\ntrivial. This expression can be inserted back into (56). Assuming R = R(a) as a monotonic function of a, one finds\nthat fR = (df /da)/(dR/da), and equation (51) becomes a differential equation for R(a), which can be written as\nR\u2032 =\n\n6\n\u00d7 {\u2212R2 [2a3 (H \u2212 aH \u2032 )\u03bc30\na3 (18a3 H\u03bc30 + 4c2 \u03c1r0 + 3ac2 \u03c1m0 ) (Ra2 + 6\u03ba)\n\n+ c2 (2\u03c1r0 + a\u03c1m0 )]a4 + 6\u03baR[6a3 \u03bc30 (H + aH \u2032 ) \u2212 c2 (4\u03c1r0 + a\u03c1m0 )]a2 \u2212 72c2 \u03ba2 \u03c1r0 } ,\n\n(59)\n\n\f10\nwhere the prime denotes differentiation with respect to the scale factor a. Eq.(59) can be further rewritten as a second\norder differential equation in H(a), by using equation (10),\nR = \u221212 H 2 \u2212 6 a H H \u2032 \u2212 6\n\n\u03ba\n.\na2\n\n(60)\n\nSubstituting (60) into (59) one finds\nH \u2032\u2032 = \u2212\n\n1\n\u00d7 {24a\u03ba2 \u03bc30 + H[a2 {a2 (6a3 H\u03bc30 + 4c2 \u03c1r0\na4 H 2 (18a3 H\u03bc30 + 4c2 \u03c1r0 + 3ac2 \u03c1m0 )\n2\n\n+ 3ac2 \u03c1m0 )H \u2032 + a[12a\u03ba\u03bc30 + H(78a3 H\u03bc30 + 32c2 \u03c1r0 + 21ac2 \u03c1m0 )]H \u2032\n+ 12H[2a\u03ba\u03bc30 + H(2a3 H\u03bc30 + 2c2 \u03c1r0 + ac2 \u03c1m0 )]} \u2212 8c2 \u03ba\u03c1r0 ]} .\n\n(61)\n\nThis differential equation selects those f (R) models which satisfy, at the same time, both the Friedmann equation and\nthe Noether condition. It has to be stressed that, having chosen a as the time variable, finding the H(a)'s which solve\n(61) uniquely fixes the metric tensor. Hence, H(a) represents a fully solved exact solution for the Einstein equations.\nOf course,\nif one wants to know the link between a and the proper time, a = a(t), one needs to find the integral\nR\nt = da/(aH).\nThe case \u03bc0 = 0 is interesting as it allow us to find analytical solutions, as the differential equation becomes (2nd order and) linear for the variable H 2 . In this case, the solution of the equation will be a family\nH = H(a, d1 , d2 , c2 , \u03bc0 , \u03ba, \u03c1r0 , \u03c1m0 ), where d1,2 are two constants coming from the integration of Eq.(61). In turn, by\nusing Eq.(60), it is possible to define a function R = R(a, d1 , d2 , c2 , \u03bc0 , \u03c1r0 , \u03c1m0 ), which can then be substituted into\nEq.(58) in order to find the explicit parametric form of f (R), i.e. f = f (a, d1 , d2 , c2 , \u03bc0 , \u03c1r0 , \u03c1m0 ). In other words, we\nfind the explicit parametric form for f (R) where the parameter used to describe the f (R) is the scale factor a (see\nalso [21] for a comparison with observations. However, in that case, the adopted f (R) models were constructed by\nphenomenological considerations and not derived from some first principle, as the existence of symmetries as discussed\nhere).\nWe can distinguish some relevant cases.\n1. k = 0, \u03bc0 = 0. In this case, by exactly integrating equation (61), we find\nH 2 = d2\n\nd1 + 8 a \u03c1r0 + 3 \u03c1m0 a2\n,\na4\n\n(62)\n\nwhere d1,2 are integration constants, with [d1 ] = M 4 and [d2 ] = M \u22122 . This expression for H(a) together with\n(58) and (60) form a solution for the set of ODE's (9), and (44), so that Eq. (48) is satisfied giving \u03bc0 = 0.\nAlthough this solution is analytical it cannot be accepted because it allows for a negative Newton constant. In\nfact, equation (57) cannot be satisfied by equation (58) if k = 0, \u03bc0 = 0. However the non-linear case \u03bc0 /c2 < 0\ncould actually lead to physical solutions (to be discussed elsewhere in a forthcoming paper). For the same\nreason, also the case k = \u22121, \u03bc0 = 0 should be rejected.\n2. k = 1, \u03bc0 = 0. As far as R < \u221218\u03ba/a2, the second term in the l.h.s. of equation (58) becomes positive, allowing\nfor the possibility of finding a physical solution. The integration of (61) leads to\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u221a\n32 \u03c12r0 \u03ba 1\n16\u03c1r0 \u03ba 1\n3 d2 \u03c1m0\n2\n+ 8 d2 \u03c1r0 \u2212\n+\n,\n(63)\nH =\n2 d1 \u2212\n2\n4\n3\n9\u03c10m\na\n3\u03c1m0\na\na2\nwith [d1 ] = M 2 , and [d2 ] = M \u22122 . In order to find d1 and d2 one can fit this formula with the standard Friedmann\nequation of GR with only matter, radiation and curvature. Therefore, one has to consider\n\u221a\n32 \u03c12r0 \u03ba\n2 d1 \u2212\n= H02 \u03a9eff\nr0 ,\n9\u03c120m\n16\u03c1r0 \u03ba\n= H02 \u03a9eff\n8 d2 \u03c1r0 \u2212\nm0 ,\n3\u03c1m0\n3 d2 \u03c1m0 = H02 \u03a9eff\nk0 ,\n\n(64)\n(65)\n(66)\n\nbut this system admits no solutions as one finds\n\u03ba=\nusing today's data [52].\n\n1\n2\n\nH02 \u03a9eff\nk0 \u2212\n\n3\n16\n\n\u03c1m0 2 eff\nH \u03a9 <0\n\u03c1r0 0 m0\n\n(67)\n\n\f11\nCase c2 = 0\n\nB.\n\nIn this case, the Noether condition (45) reduces to\n\u03c1r0 + 3 a4 f + 12 \u03ba a2 fR = 0 .\n1.\n\n(68)\n\nVacuum and dust only case\n\nIn this case we have \u03c1r0 = 0, and a flat universe cannot be solution as one would obtain f = 0. Considering k 6= 0\none finds\nfR = \u2212\n\na2 f\n.\n4\u03ba\n\n(69)\n\nSince fR < 0 then f is positive when k < 0 and viceversa. Substituting this into the Friedmann equation one finds\n{a3 c1 [(12H 2 + R) a2 + 10\u03ba]} f = 4\u03ba (6H\u03bc30 + c1 \u03c1m0 ) .\n\n(70)\n\nRestricting ourselves only to the study of the simple and linear case of a vanishing \u03bc0 , we can distinguish two cases\n1. \u03c1m0 = 0, \u03bc0 = 0. In this case one needs to impose\nR = \u221212H 2 \u2212 10\n\n\u03ba\n,\na2\n\n(71)\n\nwhich, together with the definition of R, gives\nH 2 = 2d1 \u2212\n\n2\u03ba\n,\n3a2\n\n(72)\n\nwhere d1 is a constant of integration with dimensions M 2 . This behavior describes a universe with only a\ncosmological constant and curvature. Equation (68) can now be solved for f (a) giving\nf=\n\n\u0014\n\u00151/2\nd2\nR + 24d1\n= d2 \u2212\n,\na\n2\u03ba\n\n(73)\n\nwhere d2 is a constant of integration with dimensions M 4 .\n2. \u03c1m0 6= 0, \u03bc0 = 0. In this case the Friedmann equation and (69) give\nf=\n\n(12H 2\n\n4\u03ba \u03c1m0\n.\n+ R) a5 + 10\u03baa3\n\n(74)\n\nSubstituting this expression in (69), and using the definition for R in terms of H(a) one finds a linear 2nd order\ndifferential equation in H 2 (a), which has solution\nH2 =\n\n2\u03ba\nd1\n+ 2d2 \u2212 2 ,\n2a4\n3a\n\n(75)\n\nwhere d1,2 are integration constants, and [d1 ] = [d2 ] = M 2 . Therefore one has\nR = \u221224d2 \u2212\nf = \u2212\n\n2\u03ba\n,\na2\n\n2\u03ba \u03c1m0\n.\n3 a d1\n\n(76)\n(77)\n\n\f12\n2.\n\nRadiation and dust case\n\nAlso in this case, we have three possibilities, according to the values of k.\n1. k = 0. In this case one finds that\nf =\u2212\n\n\u03c1r0\n.\n3a4\n\n(78)\n\nTherefore we have\nfR =\n\nf\u2032\n=\nR\u2032\n\n4\n3\n\n\u03c1r0\n.\na5 R \u2032\n\n(79)\n\nA well-behaved background evolution requires, with our conventions, R\u2032 > 0, so that fR > 0. This means a\nnegative effective Newton constant, i.e. the solution cannot be accepted.\n2. k 6= 0. In this case, using equation (68) one finds\nfR = \u2212\n\n\u03c1r0\nf a2\n\u2212\n,\n2\n12 \u03ba a\n4\u03ba\n\nand then using Friedmann equation (50) one can solve for f , as follows\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u2212c1 12H 2 + R \u03c1r0 a2 + 12\u03ba 6H\u03bc30 + c1 \u03c1m0 a + 6c1 \u03ba\u03c1r0\nf=\n.\n3a4 c1 [(12H 2 + R) a2 + 10\u03ba]\n\n(80)\n\n(81)\n\nBy plugging this relation into the Noether condition (68), and using the definition of R in terms of H, H \u2032 , and\na, one finds the following differential equation for H(a)\nh\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001 2\naH \u2212 18aH\u03bc30 + 3ac1 \u03c1m0 + 4c1 \u03c1r0 H \u2032 a4 \u2212 3 aH 30aH\u03bc30 + 5ac1 \u03c1m0 + 8c1 \u03c1r0 \u2212 4\u03ba\u03bc30 H \u2032 a2\n\u2032\u2032\nH =\na5 H 2 (18aH\u03bc30 + 3ac1 \u03c1m0 + 4c1 \u03c1r0 )\n\u0001\u0003\n4\u03ba 6aH\u03bc30 + ac1 \u03c1m0 + 2c1 \u03c1r0 \u2212 8\u03ba2 \u03bc30\n.\n(82)\n+\na5 H 2 (18aH\u03bc30 + 3ac1 \u03c1m0 + 4c1 \u03c1r0 )\nIn the case \u03bc0 = 0, \u03c1m0 6= 0, this differential equation can be exactly integrated to give\nH2 =\n\n16\u03ba\u03c12r0\n8d1 \u03c1r0\n2\u03ba\n3\u03c1m0 d1\n256\u03ba\u03c13r0\n+\n+\n\u2212 2+\n+ 2d2 ,\n3\n2\n5\n4\n5\n405a \u03c1m0\n27a \u03c1m0\n5a\n3a\n2a4\n\n(83)\n\nwhere d1,2 are two constants of integration with dimensions [d1 ] = M \u22122 = [d2 ]\u22121 . It is interesting to note the\npresence of a new cosmological term in this Friedmann equation, which goes as a\u22125 , which would correspond to\na matter term with equation of state parameter w = 2/3.\nIf \u03bc0 = 0, \u03c1m0 = 0, i.e. a universe filled with radiation only, equation (82) has the following solution\nH 2 = 2d2 +\n\n2d1\n2\u03ba\n\u2212 2,\n5\n5a\n3a\n\n(84)\n\nwith [d1 ] = [d2 ] = M 2 .\nC.\n\nCase c1 , c2 6= 0\n\nIn this case, one can divide equation (45) by c1 finding\nfR =\n\na2 + c3 \u03c1r0 + 3 a4 f\n,\nc3 R \u2212 6 k\n2 a4\n\n(85)\n\na2 \u2212 c3\n\u03bc\u030330\nfR H ,\n+\na (a2 + c3 ) a2 + c3\n\n(86)\n\nwhere c3 = c2 /c1 6= 0.

In this case f is\na function of a since both R and H are functions of a. We can still go further by using the same trick used in the\nprevious section, i.e. considering f as an implicit function of a into the Noether condition (85).

This result is relevant since there is a free parameter c3 , which together with the initial conditions\nfor H0 and H0\u2032 , uniquely specify the dynamics. This non-linear ODE is still of second order in H(a) as the 0, 0-Einstein\nequation for any f (R) theory. However, there is a huge improvement as this equation is independent of the explicit\nform f (R), having as the only unknown parameters two real numbers, c3 and \u03bc0 , the Noether charge. This also says\nthat for any value of the Noether charge there is a solution, the solution of (90).

This makes the problem of solving it much easier. In\nfact, analytical solutions for k = 0, \u00b11 can be achieved. Let us discuss them.\n1. k = 0.

This is clearly a\ndeviation from standard GR, because there is a 1/a term, which leads to an accelerated behavior if dominates.\nFurthermore there are terms, all involving \u03c1r0 , which include the arctangent of a, where c3 is supposed to be\npositive. These terms have different behavior at low and high redshift. In fact since lim arctan(a) \u223c a at high\na\u21920\n\nredshifts, these terms behave as dust, 1/a and a respectively, and are subdominant with respect to the radiation.\nOn the other hand, since lim arctan(a) \u223c \u03c0/2 for large and positive a, these terms will behave as radiation,\na\u2192\u221e\ncurvature and cosmological constant respectively. It is also interesting to notice that in order to have a true\ndust matter component at late times, it has to be\n8\u03c0G\n3/2\n10 \u03c1r0 d2 c3 =\n\u03c1m0 .\n(101)\n3\nThis means that \u03c1r0 behaves as the source of matter component in this modified Friedmann equation. A\ncosmological constant term is also present. It is determined by the integration constants of the Noether condition.\nAs for the case c3 < 0, the solution of Eq.

In general, a solutions of the cosmological equations\nis not a solution compatible with the condition LX L = 0. This is a peculiar situation which holds only if conserved\nquantities (Noether's charges) are intrinsically present in the structure of the theory (in our case, the form of f (R)).\nFor example, imposing a power law solution, a \u221d tp , defines a function of R = R(a), which can be put in the Noether\nsymmetry equations, in order to find f = f (R(a)). Finally one can substitute the expressions for f (a), R(a), and H\nin the Friedmann equations. In doing this, it is easy to show that, for k = 0, there are no simple power-law solutions\ncompatible with a Noether charge.\nThe method discussed above allows to discriminate theories which admit or not cosmological solutions compatible\nwith a Noether charge.\nIt is also clear that power-law solutions do exist in general for f (R) models, but they can be found using different\nmethods [24]. Assuming, in general, a power-law H(a), one finds R as a function of a, and then, in principle,\nf = f (R(a)). It is therefore possible to write the Einstein equation as a second order differential equation for f as\na function of a, whereas all other quantities (H and R) are given functions of a. The same argument holds for the\nredshift z [21].\nFor example, let us rewrite the Friedmann equation (8) as\n\u0012\n\u0013\n6k\n\u03c1m0\n\u03c1r0\nf \u2212 6 fRR \u1e58 H \u2212 6 fR H 2 \u2212 fR R + 2 = 3 + 4 ,\n(110)\na\na\na\nand let us consider H = H\u0304(a) and R = R\u0304(a) as given functions of a, being, as above,\nR\u0304 = \u221212 H\u0304 2 \u2212 6 a H\u0304 H\u0304 \u2032 \u2212 6\n\nk\n.\na2\n\n(111)\n\nThe Friedmann equation can be written as\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0012\nR\u0304\u2032\n1 R\u0304\u2032\u2032\n1\n\u03c1m0 a + \u03c1r0 \u2032\n6k\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\nf\n\u2212\nf +\n\u2212 \u2032 +\nR\u0304 .\nf =\u2212\nR\u0304\n+\n2\n2\n2\na\na\nR\u0304\n6a H\u0304\n6a H\u0304\n6 a5 H\u0304 2\n\n(112)\n\nThis is a second order linear equation in f , whose general solutions depends on two parameters, f0 and f0\u2032 . Specifically,\nbeing the equation linear, the general solution is the linear combination of two solutions of the homogeneous ODE\nplus a particular solution. It is then clear that more than one f (R) model can have the same behavior for H(a), i.e.\nmore theories share the same cosmological evolution. This situation is due to the fact that one has a fourth-order\ngravity theory. The singular points of this differential equation are those for which either H\u0304 or dR\u0304/da vanishes.\nStarting from these considerations, interesting classes of solutions can be found out.\n1.\n\nRadiation solutions\n\nLet us seek for all the f (R) models which have the particular solution a =\nH\u0304 =\n\nH0\n1\n= 2 ,\n2 t0 a 2\na\n\nso that\n\np\nt/t0 , which means\n\nR\u0304 = \u2212\n\n6k\n,\na2\n\n(113)\n\nwhere H0 \u2261 (2 t0 )\u22121 .

The approach is based on the search for Noether symmetries which allow to reduce the dynamics and, in\nprinciple, to solve more easily the equations of motion. Besides, due to the fact that such symmetries are always\nrelated to conserved quantities, such a method can be seen as a physically motivated criterion.\nThe main point is that the existence of the symmetry allows to fix the form of f (R) models assumed in a point-like\ncosmological action where the FLRW metric is imposed. It is worth noticing that, starting from a point-like FLRW\nLagrangian, and then deriving the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion, leads exactly to the same equations obtained\nby imposing the FLRW metric in the Einstein field equations. This circumstance allows to search \"directly\" the\nNoether symmetries in the point-like Lagrangian and then to plug the related conserved quantities into the equations\nof motion. As a result i) the form of the f (R) is fixed directly by the symmetry existence conditions and ii) the\ndynamical system is reduced since some of its variables (at least one) is cyclic.\nThe method is useful not only in a cosmological context but it works, in principle, every time a canonical, point-like\nLagrangian is achieved (in [54], it has been used to find out spherically symmetric solutions in f (R) gravity).\nIn this paper, we have considered a generic f (R) theory where standard fluid matter (dust and radiation) is present.\nThe Noether conditions for symmetry select forms of f (R) depending on a set of cosmological parameters such as\n{\u03c1r0 , \u03c1m0 , k, H0 } and the effective gravitational coupling. Such a dependence can be easily translated into the more\nsuitable set of observational parameters {\u03a9r0 , \u03a9m0 , \u03a9k , H0 } and then matched with data. This situation has a twofold\nrelevance: from one side, it could contribute to remove the well known problem of degeneracy (several dark energy\nmodels fit the same data and, essentially, reproduce the \u039bCDM model); from the other side, being the search for\nNoether symmetries a relevant approach to find out conserved quantities in physics, this could be an interesting\nmethod to select models motivated at a fundamental level. It is worth noticing that the Noether constant of motion,\nwhich we have found, has the dimensions of a mass and is directly related to the various sources present into dynamics.\nIn some sense, the Noether constant \"determines\" the bulk of the various sources as \u03c1m0 , \u03c1r0 and the effective \u03c1\u039b\nand then could greatly contribute to solve the dark energy and dark matter puzzles. In a forthcoming paper, we will\ndirectly compare the solutions which we have presented here with observational data.\nThe \"non-Noether solutions\" deserve a final remark. In this case, we do not ask for a Noether symmetry but,\nfinding these solutions, can be related to the previous general method. We have shown that the standard cosmological\nbehaviors of the usual Einstein-Friedmann cosmology can be achieved also in generic f (R) models, assuming that\nthe cosmological quantities H and R depend on the scale factor a. As result, we find out general f (R(a)) where the\nstandard solutions of the linear f (R) = R case are easily recovered.\nAcknowledgment. We want to thank prof. Ringeval and prof.

(88), we can find f (a) as follows\n\u0010\u221a \u0011\n\u0010\u221a \u0011\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a 3a\n\u221a 3a\n3\u03c1\narctanh\n3\u03c1\narctanh\n2\n4\n12\nr0\nr0\n8d1 c3\n24d1 c3\n3\u03c1r0\n12\u03c1r0\n\u2212c3\n\u2212c3\n\u221a\n.\nf =\u2212 3 \u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212 4 +\n\u2212 2\na\na\na\na c3\na3 \u2212c3\na(\u2212c3 )3/2\n\n(A2)\n\n(A3)\n\nThese expressions for f, R, H fulfill equation (9). The system has also a constant of motion \u03bc0 = 0 given by equation\n(48), as the Lagrangian possesses a Noether symmetry.\nWe will discuss how to link this solution (extending this procedure to the other solutions is straightforward) to the\nscalar-tensor picture, by finding the potential for the scalar non-minimally coupled with gravity. In fact, starting from\nthe action\nZ\n\u221a\nS = d4 x \u2212g f (R) + Sm ,\n(A4)\none can rewrite it (at least at the classical level) in the following form\nZ\n\u221a\nS = d4 x \u2212g[f\u03c6 R \u2212 V (\u03c6)] + Sm ,\n\n(A5)\n\nwhere V = \u03c6 f\u03c6 \u2212 f (\u03c6), and f\u03c6 = \u2202f /\u2202\u03c6. The classical equation of motion for \u03c6 leads to \u03c6 = R. One can make a\nfield redefinition to bring the action in the form\nZ\n\u221a\nS = d4 x \u2212g[\u2212\u03c7 R \u2212 V (\u03c7)] + Sm ,\n(A6)\nwhere \u03c7 = \u2212f\u03c6 .\nIn this case we can use our solutions in order to find V (\u03c7), the only unknown in the theory. One can do it as follows\n\u03c7 = \u2212f\u03c6 = \u2212fR = \u2212\n\nf\u2032\nR\u2032\n\nV = \u03c6 f\u03c6 \u2212 f = R fR \u2212 f = R\n\n(A7)\nf\u2032\n\u2212 R,\nR\u2032\n\n(A8)\n\nwhere these relations are correct on shell, i.e. for the solutions of the equations of motion. Using equations (A1),\n\n\f22\n(A2), and (A3), one can write down explicitly the potential, at least for this case, as follows\nV (\u03c7) = 3456d1d32 \u03c73 (\u2212c3 )13/2 \u2212 10368d42\u03c1r0 \u03c74 c63\n\u0011\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\u221a \u0010\np\n3 6d2 \u03c7(\u2212c3 )5/2 + \u221236d22 \u03c72 c53 \u2212 c3\n\u221a 3\n\uf8fb c43\n\u221a\n\u2212 1728 3d2 \u03c1r0 \u03c73 arctanh\uf8f0\n\u2212c3\nq\n+ 1728d32 \u03c1r0 \u03c73 \u221236d22 \u03c72 c53 \u2212 c3 (\u2212c3 )7/2 \u2212 288d1 d2 \u03c7(\u2212c3 )5/2 + 432d22 \u03c1r0 \u03c72 c23\n\u0011\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\u221a \u0010\np\nq\n3 6d2 \u03c7(\u2212c3 )5/2 + \u221236d22 \u03c72 c53 \u2212 c3\n\u221a 2\n\uf8fb (\u2212c3 )3/2\n\u221a\n+ 288 3d2 \u03c1r0 \u03c72 \u221236d22 \u03c72 c53 \u2212 c3 arctanh\uf8f0\n\u2212c3\n\u0011\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\u221a \u0010\np\nq\n3 6d2 \u03c7(\u2212c3 )5/2 + \u221236d22 \u03c72 c53 \u2212 c3\n\u221a\n\uf8fb \u2212 16d1 \u221236d22 \u03c72 c53 \u2212 c3\n\u221a\n+ 144 3d2 \u03c1r0 \u03c7 arctanh\uf8f0\n\u2212c3\np\nq\n96d2 \u03c1r0 \u03c7 \u221236d22 \u03c72 c53 \u2212 c3\n9\u03c1r0\n2 2\n\u221a\n\u2212\n\u2212 2 \u2212 576d1 d2 \u03c7 \u221236d22 \u03c72 c53 \u2212 c3 c43\nc3\n\u2212c3\n\u0011\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\u221a \u0010\np\nq\n3 6d2 \u03c7(\u2212c3 )5/2 + \u221236d22 \u03c72 c53 \u2212 c3\n\u221a\n\uf8fb.\n\u221a\n+ 8 3\u03c1r0 (\u2212c3 )\u22125/2 \u221236d22 \u03c72 c53 \u2212 c3 arctanh\uf8f0\n(A9)\n\u2212c3\n\nIn order to study the evolution of the background, whether or not it leads to a viable dynamics for the universe, it is\nalready sufficient to check if the Hubble parameter given by (A1) can fit the data, from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis up\nto Dark Energy domination.\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n[22]\n[23]\n[24]\n\nA.
