This is a short review of the framework proposed in [1] which gives rise to indirect Dark\nMatter (DM) signals explaining the recent cosmic-ray anomalies and links cosmic-ray signals of\nDM to LHC signals of a leptonic Higgs sector.The states of the leptonic Higgs doublet are lighter\nthan about 200 GeV, yielding large \u03c4\u0304\u03c4 and \u03c4\u0304\u03c4 \u03c4\u0304\u03c4 event rates at the LHC. For the case of annihilations,\ncosmic photon and neutrino signals are constrained.\nKeywords: Cosmic-Rays, Dark Matter, Higgs Physics\nPACS: 12.60.-i;12.60.fr;95.35.+d;95.30.Cq;98.70.Sa\n\nINTRODUCTION\nRecent observations of high-energy electron and positron cosmic ray spectra have generated tremendous interest in the astrophysics and particle physics community. The\nPAMELA experiment reported an excess of positrons in the few GeV to 100 GeV range.\nIn addition, results from the FERMI-LAT and HESS experiments suggest an excess of\nelectrons and positrons in the 100 GeV to 1 TeV range.\nThe cosmic-ray data from these experiments show some puzzling features. For example, PAMELA suggests an excess only in positrons, but not in antiprotons. In addition,\nalthough FERMI and HESS experiments seem to suggest an excess in electrons and\npositrons compared to the naive astrophysical background, the excess is not as sharp\nas that reported by the earlier results of ATIC. There is still a considerable amount of\nuncertainty in the astrophysical processes which provide the background for the above\nsignals. Therefore, the explanation of these observations imply one or more of the following : a) Our present understanding of the astrophysical background is incomplete, b)\nThere is a nearby astrophysical source of primary electrons and positrons, such as pulsars, and c) The source of primary electrons and positrons is Dark Matter (DM) whose\ninteractions are governed by an underlying particle physics model.\n\nTHE FRAMEWORK\nIn [1], we focussed on c) as an explanation of the cosmic-ray data. Any particle physics\nmodel of DM trying to explain the excesses in the above experiments must address two\nimportant issues. First, for annihilating DM these signals require that the annihilation\ncross-section for DM particles is typically two to three orders of magnitude larger\nthan that expected from the thermal freezeout of WIMP DM. The discrepancy between\nthe two cross-sections can, however, be resolved in scenarios which contain \"moduli\"\nwhose decay could give rise to non-thermal production of Dark Matter and also in\n\n\fscenarios which contain light particles in the dark sector giving rise to a Sommerfeld\nenhancement in the present cross-section. For decaying DM, the relic abundance could\nbe given by conventional thermal freezeout, but the life-time of the DM particles must\nbe extremely large (\u223c 1025 -1026 s) and new physics is needed to explain it. As we will\nsee later, this can also be achieved in a natural manner. Second, the signals apparently\nrequire annihilations or decays dominantly into leptons rather than hadrons, since there\nis no reported excess in anti-proton cosmic rays (assuming that our understanding of the\nastrophysical background is roughly correct). There are two natural ways to achieve this\n- i) by kinematics, since leptons are lighter than quarks, and ii) by a symmetry, which\nforces the DM to annihilate/decay dominantly to leptons.\nIn addition to the known physics of Standard Model (SM) particles and their interactions, we expect new physics to include both a Higgs sector, responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking, and a DM sector. The idea of a WIMP DM sector is particularly interesting as it ties in with general ideas about electroweak symmetry breaking.\nThe interactions between the higgs sector and the\nStandard Model sector are well known; on the other\nhand the interactions of the WIMP DM sector with\nthe other two sectors are more speculative. However, the WIMP idea is that the mass\nscales of the dark matter and Higgs sectors are both related to the weak scale, and\nthis strongly suggests some connection between these two sectors. With the above\nphilosophy, in [1] we studied a general framework exploring the possibility that any\ndirect couplings between the WIMP sector and the visible sector are subdominant; thus\nthe Higgs sector is seen to be the messenger that makes the WIMP visible to us, as shown\nin the schematic above. The nature of the Higgs sector is determined by the constraints\nfrom the cosmic-ray data. The Higgs sector in the SM or the MSSM does not give rise\nto a good fit to the data as in these cases the higgs decays predominantly to pairs of\nW bosons, bottom quarks or top quarks (if heavy enough), giving rise typically to too\nmany anti-protons than actually observed by PAMELA. Thus, from the data we are quite\ngenerally led to a framework in which the higgs couples dominantly to leptons, hence\nthe name \"leptonic higgs\". Such a higgs sector can be naturally obtained, for example\nby imposing an appropriate approximate Z2 symmetry on the general two-higgs doublet\nmodel[1]. Many classes of models for the Dark sector, utilizing both annihilations and\ndecays, can be constructed within this general framework, demonstrating its generality.\nSince the higgs couples via yukawa couplings, the leptonic higgs will dominantly\ndecay to pairs of tau leptons which will subsequently cascade to electrons and positrons.\nA straightforward consequence of this is that fitting the PAMELA data requires a larger\nDM mass than in models where the WIMP cascades directly to electrons or muons, and\nthat the FERMI and HESS signals are quite smooth. Also, the signal for the positron\nfraction in PAMELA is expected to continue to energies larger than 100 GeV, and not\nto show a very sharp peak. Another very interesting feature of the framework results\nfrom the production of tau leptons. Since decays of taus give rise to an O(1) fraction of\nphotons (mostly from \u03c0 0 s coming from tau decays) and neutrinos (from three-body tau\ndecays), there is an exciting possibility of detecting energetic gamma rays and neutrinos\nin the energy range 100-1000 GeV. However, these signals depend on whether the taus\noriginate from DM annihilations or DM decays.\n\n\fSIGNALS\nThe main focus of [1] was to emphasize the general nature of the Higgs sector through\nwhich the WIMP DM sector couples to the visible sector, and not to specialize to a\nparticular DM sector. Therefore, both annhilation and decay modes of the DM particles\nwere studied and simple models giving rise to both modes were provided. Also, depending on whether DM is a scalar or fermion, the leptonic cosmic ray signals could arise\nfrom a variety of channels: DM annihilation to \u03c4 4 , \u03c4 2 \u03bd 2 or DM decay to \u03c4 4 , \u03c4 2 , \u03c4 2 \u03bd , \u03c4\u03bd l\nvia intermediate higgs states [1]. Since the annihilation and decay modes can be related\nin a simple manner, results are shown in Figure 1 for a particular annihilation mode in\nwhich the DM annihilates to 4\u03c4 's via the higgs scalar H and the psuedoscalar A. Good\nfits to both PAMELA and FERMI, HESS can be obtained for mDM around 4-5 TeV with\na total electronic boost factor Btot\ne of about 10,000. The boost factor is an enhancement\nfactor which could arise from many sources, such as a larger cross-section compared to\nthe \"standard\" thermal one, a clumpiness in the local DM halo, etc. The precise spectrum depends on the astrophysical parameters of the propagation model of electrons and\npositrons with a mild dependence on the masses of the intermediate higgs states; hence\nthe above masses and electronic boost-factors should only be taken as an estimate.\n\nFIGURE 1. Left: The positron fraction for 1, 1.5 and 4 TeV DM masses for the \"4\u03c4 \" annihilation mode\ne+\ne\u2212\n3\nwith Btot\ne given by 1200, 1950 and 10000 respectively. Right: Results for E (\u03a6total + \u03a6total ) for a 4 TeV\ntot\nDM mass with Be = 10000 for the same mode. The MED propagation model is used. The average local\nhalo density is taken to be 0.3GeV/cm3.\n\nIn order to test approach, it is useful to look for correlated signals. As mentioned\nearlier, production of taus will inevitably give rise to a large number of energetic photons\nand neutrinos arising from the decay of the taus. Since the signal from annihilations\n2\nin contrast to \u03c1DM for decays, the\ndepends on the square of the DM density \u03c1DM\nconstraints from the non-observation of photons and neutrinos from the Galactic Center\n(GC) and nearby dwarf galaxies are much more stringent for annihilations than for\ndecays. For example, for the annihilation channel the constraints from photons can\ntypically only be satisfied for shallow DM profiles and for a smaller photon boost-factor\ntot\nBtot\n\u03b3 than the electronic one Be . At the same time, however, the annihilation modes also\nlead to better detection possibilites for future experiments. For the decay modes, it turns\nout that neutrinos provide better detection prospects than photons [1].\n\n\fOne of the most interesting aspects of this framework is the existence of not only\ncorrelated cosmic-ray signals, but also correlated Higgs signals at the LHC! Since the\nDM masses typically turn out to be a TeV or higher, it is hard to produce the DM particles\ndirectly at the LHC but the leptonic and hadronic Higgs states could be produced at\nthe LHC since they are O(100) GeV, which subsequently decay to tau leptons. For\nconcrete predictions, we studied a two-higgs doublet model in which a softly broken\ndiscrete symmetry (parity) forces one of the higgs to couple dominantly to leptons and\nthe other to quarks. This gives rise to extremely interesting 4\u03c4 signals at the LHC from\nDrell-Yan production of the leptonic higgs and its pseudoscalar partner, followed by\ntheir decays to tau pairs. The same process also gives rise to production of charged\nhiggs pairs H \u00b1 which dominantly decay to \u03c4 \u00b1 \u03bd . This channel therefore provides a new\nsearch strategy for the Higgs which has not been well studied so far, and could provide\na discovery channel for modest luminosities around 30 f b\u22121 . In addition, we find that\nthe 2\u03c4 signal from single higgs (both leptonic and hadronic) production by vector boson\nfusion followed by decay to tau pairs can be naturally enhanced compared to that for\nthe Standard Model Higgs, and hence could also provide a discovery channel at modest\nluminosities. So, Higgs physics seems to be extremely promising.\nFinally, we comment on the general compatibility of DM models trying to explain\ncosmic ray signals, with the observed upper bound on the DM relic abundance. For\nannihilating DM, the cross-section required to explain the cosmic-ray signals is typically larger by \u223c 100 \u2212 1000 than that required to obtain the correct relic abundance\nfrom a \"standard\" thermal freeze-out computation. Since the (leptonic) higgs messengers of DM are naturally of O(100) GeV, there is no large sommerfeld enhancement as\nin models proposed by [2]. However, the correct relic-abundance can be obtained even\nfor a much larger annihilation cross-section if there exist late-decaying light scalar fields\n(moduli) because then the relic abundance is determined by the reheat temperature of\nthe moduli rather than the freezeout temperature of DM. This leads to non-thermal production of DM, which with some reasonable assumptions, surprisingly has the correct\nabundance, due to the existence of a non-thermal WIMP \"miracle\" as emphasized in [3].\nIn fact, such light moduli fields automatically occur within \"realistic\" string theory compactifications, hence non-thermal production of DM is quite natural [4]. For decaying\nDM, one has to explain the extremely long lifetime (\u223c 1026 s) required for the cosmic ray\ndata. It turns out that if the lepton parity (for a leptonic higgs) and dark parity (the parity\nwhich keeps the DM stable) are spontaneously broken by \u223c vEW /MGUT , then a lifetime\nof the correct magnitude can be naturally obtained. Note that signals for LHC Higgs\nphysics are the same for both annihilation and decay modes since the parity breaking\neffects are extremely small.\n\nREFERENCES\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n\nH. S. Goh, L. J.
