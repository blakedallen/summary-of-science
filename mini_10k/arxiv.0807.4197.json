We examine the bar instability in models with an exponential disk and a cuspy\nNFW-like dark matter (DM) halo inspired by cosmological simulations. Bar evolution is studied\nas a function of numerical resolution in a sequence of models spanning 104\u22128 DM particles including a multi-mass model with an effective resolution of 1010 . The goal is to find convergence\nin dynamical behaviour. We characterize the bar growth, the buckling instability, pattern speed\ndecay through resonant transfer of angular momentum, and possible destruction of the DM halo\ncusp. Overall, most characteristics converge in behaviour for halos containing more than 107\nparticles in detail. Notably, the formation of the bar does not destroy the density cusp in this\ncase. These higher resolution simulations clearly illustrate the importance of discrete resonances\nin transporting angular momentum from the bar to the halo.\nKeywords. galaxies: spiral, structure, evolution; dark matter, methods: n-body simulations,\nstellar dynamics\n\n1. Introduction \u2013 The bar instability in a cold gravitating disk plays a major role in\na spiral galaxy's dynamical evolution. At least 2/3 of spiral galaxies host bars (Knappen\net al. 2000) and the fraction has not evolved significantly since z \u223c 1 (Jogee et al. 2004;\nSheth et al. 2008). As models of galaxy formation become more sophisticated and reveal\ncomplex dynamical behaviour, it is important to understand the details of different physical processes that shape their morphology as well as to verify that numerical resolution\nis in fact adequate to follow their evolution. The bar-halo interaction is the driving mechanism in disk galaxy evolution. As a bar churns through the DM halo with a pattern\nspeed \u03a9b resonant interactions with halo orbits \u2013 a form of dynamical friction \u2013 transfer\nangular momentum from the bar to the halo and cause it to spin down (Tremaine &\nWeinberg 1984). This process was first pointed out by Lynden-Bell & Kalnajs (1972)\nand has been studied in models with idealized rigid bars (Weinberg 1985; Hernquist &\nWeinberg 1992; Weinberg & Katz 2002; Weinberg & Katz 2007) as well as in models\nin which a stellar bar forms self-consistently in an unstable disk (e.g., Sellwood 1980;\nDebattista & Sellwood 1998; O'Neill & Dubinski 2003; Holley-Bockelmann et al. 2005;\nMartinez-Valpuesta et al. 2006). There has been some concern that the process is too\nefficient, leading to bars that are much smaller than their corotation radii and so discrepant with observed bar galaxies (Debattista & Sellwood 2000). More recent studies\nwith greater resolution suggest that the bars tend to lengthen moving out to their corotation radii as they slow down and so perhaps they are not inconsistent with reality\n1\n\n\f2\n\nDubinski, Berentzen, & Shlosman\n\n(O'Neill & Dubinski 2003; Martinez-Valpuesta et al. 2006). Weinberg & Katz (2002) hold\na cautious view that lower resolution simulations can lead to spurious results because of\nthe diffusive nature of noise that may move orbits into and out of resonances artificially\nwhile insufficient particle numbers may also underpopulate the resonant regions of phase\nspace. While most current work to date has used \u223c 106 particles, they claim that as\nmany as 108 DM particles (or more) may be needed to simulate the resonant process\nwith N -body methods.\nIn this study, we attempt to clear up the inconsistencies of current work and address\nthe problem of numerical resolution hoping to converge to the correct physical behaviour.\nWe present a series of bar-unstable disk+halo N -body models with increasing resolution\nspanning a range Nh = 104 \u2212 108 DM particles with Nd = 1.8 \u00d7 103\u22127 disk particles.\nOne further simulation uses a multi-mass method that increases the halo particle number density by 200\u00d7 in the halo centre so giving an effective Nh \u223c 1010 . The mass\nmodel is constructed from a 3-integral distribution function (Widrow & Dubinski 2005)\ndescribing an exponential disk embedded within a tidally truncated NFW halo and is\nsimilar to the model studied by Martinez-Valpuesta et al. (2006). Natural units for the\nsimulations are D = 10 kpc, M = 1011 M\u2299 , V = 208 km/s, and T = 47.2 Myr. We\ndiscuss results both in simulation and physical units throughout and clarify when necessary. (For further details on the models and simulations see Dubinski, Berentzen &\nShlosman 2008). Animations of the simulations are available for viewing at the URL:\nwww.cita.utoronto.ca/~dubinski/IAU254 along with higher-resolution figures.\nAnimation 1 shows the evolution of the disks in six models with increasing resolution in\nface-on and edge-on views. The lowest resolution simulations with Nh 6 105 are clearly\ndeficient and either lose the bar or suffer from heating affects. At higher resolution,\nthe behaviour is similar exhibiting the buckling instability and relaxation to a bar in\nquasi-equilibrium that gradually lengthens and slows down. Animations 2 & 3 show the\nmulti-mass model with Nh = 108 in an inertial and corotating frame and illustrate how\nthe bar grows from noise from the inside out saturating as a thin bar on reaching the\ncorotation radius and then evolving into a fatter bar with a peanut-shaped bulge after\nthe buckling instability.\n2. Bar Growth and Pattern Speed Evolution \u2013 We study bar growth using the\nnormalized Fourier amplitude |A2 | of the m = 2 disturbance in the plane of the disk\nwithin a fixed radius R < 0.5 (5 kpc). Figure 1 shown the exponential growth of |A2 |\nbefore saturation. Higher resolution simulations reach saturation at later times. This time\ndelay is the result of the lower amplitude of the Poisson fluctuations that seed the bar.\nSince the instability grows from these fluctuations if takes longer for them to saturate\nif the initial amplitude is lower. We estimate the time delays from the peak in |A2 | and\nsynchronize the simulations for comparison of various evolutionary characteristics.\nWe can also use A2 to measure the phase angle of the m = 2 mode and so estimate the\npattern speed by taking the difference between subsequent snapshots. Figure 2 shows the\npattern speed evolution as a function of numerical resolution. There is some scatter in\nbehaviour that can be accounted for from the expected variance introduced by different\ninitial conditions but overall the agreement is good. The highest resolution simulations\nshow a modulation of the pattern speed at a frequency close to \u03a9b itself. This probably\nindicates an interaction between the bar and the gravitational wake in the halo that only\nshows up with sufficient numerical resolution.\n\n\fBars in Cuspy Dark Halos\n\n3\n\nFigure 1. Initial growth of the m = 2 Fourier component |A2 | for stars with R < 0.5 for\ntwo model sequences using Nd = 18K, 180K, 1.8M, 18M with Nh = 100K, 1M, 10M, 100M respectively. The ln |A2 | grows approximately linearly with time independent of the choice of Nd\nand Nh showing the exponential growth of the bar mode. The dashed line shows an exponential timescale that is approximately \u03c4 = 8 (370 Myr). Since the bar grows from the Poisson\nnoise within the disk then we expect the noise amplitude to be proportional to N 1/2 so larger\nsimulations will saturate at later times.\nFigure 2. Evolution of the pattern speed \u03a9b for two model sequences at different resolution.\nThe curves have been shifted in time so that the bar growth evolution is coincident with the\n1M particle model.\n\n3. Halo Density Profile \u2013 We also measured the evolution of the halo density profile\nover the course of the simulation. Previous work has shown both preservation and destruction of the density cusp so we focus on the processes in the central regions. Only studies\nusing the self-consistent field N -body method (SCF) lead to a core (Holley-Bockelmann\net al. 2005; Weinberg & Katz 2007b) and there has been some concern about numerical instabilities that arise in those methods (Selwood 2003). Figure 3 exhibits the final\ndensity profile along with the difference from the initial profile as a function of halo particle number. The profiles agree well to within the limit of their gravitational softening\nradius and show convergent behaviour. The cusp is not destroyed in this case but rather\nthe central density increases modestly, by a factor of 2, as a result of the bar evolution,\nfollowing its buckling, which leads to an increase in the central stellar density (Sellwood\n2003).\nThe bar that forms in this simulation has a similar mass ratio Mb /Mhalo \u2248 0.6 but\nis much thicker than the fiducial rigid bar simulation in Weinberg et al. (2007b) that\ndestroys the cusp. Their study also included thick bars which did not destroy the cusps\nand the bar that forms here overlaps with those in their study. We conclude that there is\nno direct contradiction with the most recent results of Weinberg et al. (2007b) but would\nargue that the thicker bar models are probably more relevant to real galaxies. Thin bars\ndo not persist for long before responding to the buckling instability and so the rigid bar\napproximation is not applicable over a Hubble time and probably not relevant to most\ngalaxies (Martinez-Valpuesta & Shlosman 2004).\n4. Orbital Resonances \u2013 The bar slowdown is the result of dynamical friction that\nleads to angular momentum transport to the DM halo. The process is due to resonant\n\n\f4\n\nDubinski, Berentzen, & Shlosman\n\nFigure 3. A comparison of density profiles at t = 7.08 Gyr for different halo particle numbers\nNh . We also show the initial density profile (dashed line) and the best fit NFW model curve\n(dotted line) to the initial profile over the range 0 < r < 100 kpc. The NFW parameters for\nthe fit are rs = 4.3 kpc, vmax = 160 km s\u22121 , where vmax is the maximum circular velocity\nat r = 2.16rs = 9.3 kpc. Note that this halo is more concentrated than the typical galactic\ndark matter halos in cosmological simulations to model the contraction expected during dissipative galaxy formation. The dotted vertical lines show the softening length \u01eb used at different\nresolutions.\n\ninteractions between the rotating bar's pattern speed and the halo particles' azimuthal\nand radial orbital frequencies. When l1 \u03a9r +l2 \u03a9\u03c6 = m\u03a9b then orbital resonances occur and\nhalo particles torque or are torqued by the bar leading to a change in angular momentum.\nWe can estimate the orbital frequencies at a specific time by freezing the potential and\nintegrating the orbits of particles in this potential rotating with the pattern speed at that\ntime (e.g., Athanassoula 2002; Martinez-Valpuesta et al. 2006). Spectral analysis can then\nbe applied to the orbital time series to determine the fundamental orbital frequencies\n\u03a9r and \u03a9\u03c6 (Binney & Spergel 1982). (Note we label these frequencies with the usual\nepicyclic variables \u03ba \u2261 \u03a9r and \u03a9 \u2261 \u03a9\u03c6 in our figures below.) The dimensionless frequency\n\u03b7 = (\u03a9\u2212\u03a9b )/\u03ba is a useful way to characterize resonances since the values \u03b7 = 1/2, 0, \u22121/2\ncorrespond to the inner Lindblad, corotation, and outer Lindblad resonances for m = 2.\nFurther negative half-integer values correspond to higher order resonances that can also\nabsorb the angular momentum.\nFigure 4 shows the change in the z component of the angular momentum Jz for particles\nbinned as a function \u03b7 between t = 100 and t = 150 at different numerical resolution.\nThe spikes at the half-integer values reveal the resonances. Most angular momentum is\ntransferred through the corotation resonance though it is also appears to be transferred at\nother frequencies, but more randomly - this difference is probably the result of particles\nin resonance before or after t = 100. The detailed behaviour of the distributions seem to\nconverge for Nh > 107 . At lower resolutions, the resonant spikes have a smaller amplitude\nand higher order resonant interactions are missing.\n\n\fBars in Cuspy Dark Halos\n\n5\n\nFigure 4. The distribution in the change in the z angular momentum \u2206Jz between t = 100 (4.7\nGyr) and t = 150 (7 Gyr) plotted as a function of the dimensionless frequency \u03b7 = (\u03a9 \u2212 \u03a9b )/\u03ba\nmeasured at t = 100. The spikes at \u03b7 = 0.5, 0.0, \u22120.5 correspond to the ILR, COR, and OLR\nrespectively while other spikes refer to higher order resonances. This plot shows how halo particles in resonant orbits are the main sink of angular momentum. The detailed distributions are\nconverging for Nh > 107 particles while lower resolution simulation miss some of the higher\norder resonances.\n\nFinally, we examine the change in halo phase space density by computing the particle\nnumber density in (E, Lz ) space and computing the difference between t = 0 and t = 150\nin a similar way to Holley-Bockelmann et al. (2005). In this way, we clearly see the\nresonant regions visible as discrete islands of particle overdensity in (E, Lz ) space (Fig. 5).\nWe can also overplot the values of (E, Lz ) for the particles found in the resonant spikes\nin the analysis to see where they lie in phase space. The right panel of Figure 5 clearly\nshows that these islands are directly related to the discrete resonances extracted in our\nspectral analysis. Animation 4 describes the time evolution of the differential number\ndensity in phase space and reveals how the resonances move through a large fraction of\nthe halo mass. By counting particles in resonant peaks at different times we estimate\nthat roughly 30% of the halo particles are affected.\nWe conclude that the resonances are broader than thought and so simulations with\nmore than 1M halo particles do a reasonable job of tracking bar evolution. However, a look\nat the distribution of orbital frequencies reveals that higher order resonances are missed\nat lower resolution with less than 10M particles. This effect could account for the different\nrate of angular momentum loss at higher resolution. Future studies should examine the\nbar instability self-consistently using the same initial conditions with different N -body\nmethods to resolve current inconsistent results on the cusp/core evolution of DM halos.\n\n\f6\n\nDubinski, Berentzen, & Shlosman\n\nFigure 5.
