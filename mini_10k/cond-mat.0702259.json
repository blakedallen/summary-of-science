INTRODUCTION\nLocalized states of current carriers in crystals \u5171polarons\u5172\nhave been known since the 1940s \u5171see Refs. 1 and 2\u5172. The\nconcept of localized states plays an important role in many\nareas of condensed matter physics, including superconductivity.3 The concept of a polaron was introduced by S.\nI. Pekar4 and subsequently developed by many authors.\nA polaron is a quasiparticle that interacts with the polarization oscillations of a crystal lattice \u5171especially ionic crystals\u5172 such that an autolocalized state of the current carriers\narises. An autolocalized state is a particular case of a localized state and is qualitatively different from the free state of\na particle. Autolocalization occurs in a homogeneous medium due to the internal properties of the medium. The phenomenon is different from localization in an external potential.\nThe existing theory of autolocalization2,3 is a rather developed and successful theory. But its study requires advanced\nmathematics, including the calculus of variations. Moreover,\nthe theoretical calculations are very tedious, complicated,\nand must be done numerically. Instead, we will present a\nsimple model for the autolocalization of a free charged particle. This model can be used to introduce the study of autolocalization and help students understand the basic concepts of the subject without performing complicated\ncalculations. The polarization potential well in the proposed\nmodel is deep enough for only one localized level. In a more\nrealistic theory several localized levels can be found in a\nself-consistent potential well.\nIn dielectric materials with a sufficiently large dielectric\nconstant, two identical charged particles can be localized in\none polarization potential well, forming a bipolaron. A bipolaron is also a well known phenomenon2\u2013 4 and is thought to\nbe a carrier of a superconducting current in many materials.3\nThe polarization potential well for a bipolaron in the simple\nmodel that we will discuss is deep enough for only one localized level, in contrast to more accurate theories in which\nseveral levels can exist.2\u2013 4\nWhen a charged particle is in a localized state, an electrostatic field arises around it. This field polarizes the surrounding medium, so that every small volume of the medium acquires a small dipole moment. These moments are oriented\nso that there is an attraction between the moments and a\nparticle in a localized state, which means that the interaction\nenergy is negative. So a charged particle in a localized state\ncreates a potential well for itself in which it could be local\u5171\u5172\n\nized if the well is deep enough. If the well is not deep\nenough, the particle will not be in a localized state.\nLet us consider a particle with a wave function \u243a\u5171r\u5172 and a\ncharge e. The charge density is \u2433 (r)\u2afde \u243a * (r) \u243a (r). 5 Let the\ncorresponding electrostatic potential in the dielectric medium\nwith a dielectric constant \u2427 be \u2438 0 (r)/\u2427, where \u2438 0 (r) is the\nelectrostatic potential of the same particle in a vacuum.6 The\npotential of the charged particle in a dielectric medium can\nbe written as\n\n\u2438 0 \u5171 r\u5172 /\u2427\u2b05 \u2438 0 \u5171 r\u5172 \u2afa \u5173\u5171 \u2427\u2afa1 \u5172 /\u2427 \u5174 \u2438 0 \u5171 r\u5172 .\n\n\u51711\u5172\n\nThe first term on the right-hand side of Eq. \u51711\u5172 represents\nthe potential of the particle only, and the second term represents the potential produced by the polarization of the dielectric medium. Thus, the second term, \u2438 d (r)\u2afd\u2afa \u5173 (\u2427\n\u2afa1)/\u2427 \u5174 \u2438 0 (r), is the part of the potential that acts on the\nparticle. This potential is attractive because \u2427 is always\ngreater than unity.\nII. AUTOLOCALIZED CHARGED PARTICLE\nTo determine the possibility of autolocalization, we assume the following model for the localized wave function\nand hence for the charge density:\n\n\u243a \u5171 r \u5172 \u2afd \u5171 g 3/2/ \u2432 3/4\u5172 exp\u5173 \u2afa0.5\u5171 gr \u5172 2 \u5174 ,\n\n\u51712a\u5172\n\n\u2433 \u2afde \u5171 g 3 / \u2432 3/2\u5172 exp\u2afa \u5171 gr \u5172 2 .\n\n\u51712b\u5172\n\nThe quantity 1/g in Eq. \u51712\u5172 represents the autolocalization\nradius, because for r greater than 1/g, the density of the\nparticle practically vanishes. The model represented by Eq.\n\u51712\u5172 was chosen because the wave function in Eq. \u51712a\u5172 is\nsimilar to those arising in a smooth potential well. Equation\n\u51712b\u5172 is an exact consequence of Eq. \u51712a\u5172.5 The total electric\nfield, calculated by using Gauss's theorem, is\nE \u5171 r \u5172 \u2afd \u5171 e/\u2427r 2 \u5172 \u233d \u5171 gr \u5172 \u2afa \u5173 2eg/ \u5171 \u2432 1/2\u2427r \u5172\u5174 exp\u2afa \u5171 gr \u5172 2 , \u51713\u5172\nwhere \u233d(x) is the probability integral, that is, the integral of\n\u5173 (2/\u2432 1/2)exp\u2afay2\u5174 from y\u2afd0 to y\u2afdx. The part of the field\nthat acts on the particle produced by the polarization of the\ndielectric medium is\nE d \u5171 r \u5172 \u2afd \u5173\u5171 \u2427\u2afa1 \u5172 /\u2427 \u5174 \u5175 \u5173 2eg/ \u5171 \u2432 1/2r \u5172\u5174\u5173 exp\u2afa \u5171 gr \u5172 2 \u5174\n\u2afa \u5171 e/r 2 \u5172 \u233d \u5171 gr \u5172 \u5176 .\n\n\u51714\u5172\n\nThe first term of the expansion in r of the right-hand part of\nEq. \u51713\u5172 yields\n\n\fE \u5171 r \u5172 \u2afd \u5171 4eg 3 /3\u2432 1/2\u2427 \u5172 r\u2af9 \u0304 .\n\n\u51715\u5172\n\nFrom Eq. \u51715\u5172, the electrostatic potential \u2438 (r) is\n\n\u2438 \u5171 r \u5172 \u2afd \u2438 \u5171 0 \u5172 \u2afa \u5171 2/3\u2432 1/2\u5172\u5171 eg 3 /\u2427 \u5172 r 2 \u2af9 \u0304 ,\n\n\u51716\u5172\n\nwith the part produced by the polarization that acts on the\nparticle given by\n\n\u2438 \u5171 r \u5172 \u2afd \u5173\u5171 \u2427\u2afa1 \u5172 /\u2427 \u5174\u5173\u5171 2/3\u2432 1/2\u5172 eg 3 r 2 \u2afa\u2427 \u2438 \u5171 0 \u5172\u5174 \u2af9 \u0304 .\n\n\u51717\u5172\n\nThis approximate potential corresponds to a threedimensional harmonic oscillator. The model wave function\nassumed in Eq. \u51712a\u5172 corresponds to the ground state of the\nthree-dimensional harmonic oscillator. The potential represented by Eq. \u51717\u5172 is formed by many electrons and ions. For\nthis reason we can assume that the total mass of all the particles whose charges form the polarization potential \u5173represented by Eq. \u51717\u5172\u5174 is much larger than the mass of the particle under investigation. Hence, it is possible to approximate\nthe reduced mass by the original value of the mass of a\nparticle. This point is a crucial one for the phenomenon of\nautolocalization. Only the polarization of a medium created\nby heavy enough particles can lead to the autolocalization of\na charged particle, because the structure of the potential,\nwhich keeps the particle localized, should be relatively stable\nwith respect to the motion of the localized particle.\nAn autolocalized current carrier in a crystal together with\nthe surrounding polarization of the medium created by heavy\ninert particles is usually called a polaron.1\u2013 4 When the motion of a polaron is considered, we have to take into account\nthat the motion of the surrounding cloud of polarization\ncharges accompanies the motion of the localized particle.\nThis phenomenon is expressed by the larger effective mass\nof a polaron compared to the mass of a bare particle. Hence,\nthe polaron current carriers have low mobility and the\nsample has high electrical resistance. Now let us calculate\nthe depth of the potential well \u2438\u51710\u5172. For r\u2192\u2b01, the potential\n\u2438 (r) goes to zero, which means that the value of \u2438\u51710\u5172 is\nequal to the integral of E(r) from zero to infinity. Hence, we\nhave \u2438 (0)\u2afd2eg/ \u2432 1/2\u2427.

THE EQUILIBRIUM VALUE OF g\nThe equilibrium value of the inverse autolocalization radius is determined by the minimum of the energy of the\nsystem. The system consists of a charged particle and the\npolarized dielectric around it. Let us consider the intrinsic\nenergy of the polarization itself. The density of the electrostatic energy is a scalar product of D and E divided by 8\u2432.\nThe part of the induction, D, due to the polarization, Dp , is\ndetermined by the equation div Dp \u2afd0. Because we are considering the intrinsic energy of the polarization, we should\nnot include the charge of the particle. Because Dp has a\nradial component only, we have div Dp \u2afd(dD p /dr)\n\u2af9(2/r)D p \u2afd0. The only solution of this equation, D p\n\u2afdC/r 2 \u5171C is a constant\u5172, goes to infinity at r\u2afd0 when\nC\u2afd0, which is not acceptable. Thus we conclude that D p\n\u2afd0. This solution corresponds to the absence of a free\ncharge and the presence of a bound charge.6 The value of the\nelectric field is not zero, but D p \u2afdE p \u2af94 \u2432 P\u2afd0 (E p is the\nelectric field due to the polarization, and P is the density of\nthe electric dipole moment of the dielectric, which is formed\nby the bound charge\u5172. Because D p \u2afd0, the intrinsic energy of\nthe polarization is also zero, even though E p \u2afd\u2afa4 \u2432 P\u2afd0.\nThe intrinsic self-interaction energy of the particle should\nbe excluded. What is left is the energy of the interaction of\nthe particle with the polarized medium induced by the\ncharged particle. The energy at the bottom of the potential\nwell is W(0) \u5173see Eq. \u51718\u5172\u5174, but the particle occupies its\nground state with energy \u51713/2\u5172\u1794\u243b. Thus, from Eqs. \u51718\u5172\u2013\u517110\u5172,\nthe interaction energy is\nW i \u2afd \u5171 3 1/2/ \u2432 1/4\u5172\u5173\u5171 \u2427\u2afa1 \u5172 /\u2427 \u5174 1/2\u5171 e\u1794/m 1/2\u5172 g 3/2\n\u2afa \u5171 2/\u2432 1/2\u5172\u5173\u5171 \u2427\u2afa1 \u5172 /\u2427 \u5174 e 2 g.\n\n\u517112\u5172\n\nThe right-hand side of Eq. \u517112\u5172 has a minimum at\ng\u2afdg e \u2afd \u5171 16/27\u2432 1/2\u5172\u5173\u5171 \u2427\u2afa1 \u5172 /\u2427 \u5174\u5171 me 2 /\u1794 2 \u5172 .\n\n\u517113\u5172\n\nFor the typical value \u2427\u2afd5, g e \u2afd0.267(me /\u1794 ).\nAt g\u2afdg e the inequality \u517111\u5172 yields ( 94 )\u2b0d1. The ratio of\n3\n\u5171 2\u5172\u1794\u243b to \u2afaW(0) at g\u2afdg e is equal to 32, which means that at\nleast one level \u5171the ground state level\u5172 could be formed in the\npotential well. But the energy of the first excited level at g\n\u2afdg e is \u5171 23\u5172\u1794\u243b\u2af9\u1794\u243b\u2afd2.5\u1794\u243b, which is larger than the depth of\nthe potential well \u2afaW(0) \u5171the ratio of 2.5\u1794\u243b to \u2afaW(0) is\n10\n9 \u5172. Hence, the potential well in our model is not deep\nenough to have a first excited level. Moreover, the approximate model potential \u5171which is derived from the model wave\nfunction\u5172 is not correct for the wave function of the first\nexcited state of a three-dimensional oscillator. In a more realistic theory several localized levels often can be found in a\nself-consistent potential well.2\u2013 4 So our model is not suitable\nfor the description of such a case.\n2\n\n2\n\nIV. THE BINDING ENERGY\nThe binding energy is determined from Eqs. \u517112\u5172 and \u517113\u5172:\nW b \u2afdW i \u5171 g e \u5172 \u2afd\u2afa \u5171 32/81\u2432 \u5172\u5173\u5171 \u2427\u2afa1 \u5172 /\u2427 \u5174 2 \u5171 me 4 /\u1794 2 \u5172 .\n\n\u517114\u5172\n\nFor \u2427\u2afd5, we have W b \u2afd\u2afa0.0805(me /\u1794 )\u2afd\u2afa2.19 eV,\nwhich corresponds to a temperature of 25415 K, which is\nmuch larger than the ambient temperature. Because the depth\nof the potential well is much larger than kT, all the electrons\nare in an autolocalized state. So in an autolocalized state, the\n4\n\n2\n\n\felectrons in a conductivity band have considerably lower energy than in a free \u5171plane wave\u5172 state. This lower energy\ninfluences the concentration of the electrons in a conductivity band, because their concentration depends exponentially\non the gap energy.7 \u5171The gap energy is the difference between the electron energy at the bottom of the conductivity\nband and at the top of the valence band.\u5172 The concentration\nof the current carriers significantly influences the electrical\nconductivity and optical properties. Optical properties are in\na great extent dependent on the plasma frequency,7 which is\nproportional to (n/m a ) 1/2 \u5171n is the number density of the\ncurrent carriers in a conductivity band and m a is the effective\nmass of an electron in an autolocalized state\u5172. So autolocalization significantly affects various physical properties.\nV. CURRENT CARRIERS \u201eELECTRONS AND\nHOLES... IN A SEMICONDUCTOR\nThe present approach is valid when it is possible to consider a separate localized current carrier and to neglect the\npresence of the other current carriers. This assumption is\nvalid when the Debye screening radius 1/g D is much larger\nthan the localization radius of the current carrier 1/g e . When\nthe current carriers present in the sample are of one type only\nand are not degenerate,7 which means that the density of the\ncurrent carriers is not too high and the temperature is not too\nlow, then\n2\n\u2afd4 \u2432 e 2 n/\u2427kT.\ngD\n\n\u517115\u5172\n\nWe have from Eqs. \u517113\u5172 and \u517115\u5172 the inequality\nn\u2c06n u \u2afd0.00890\u5173\u5171 \u2427\u2afa1 \u5172 2 /\u2427 \u5174 kT \u5171 m 2 e 2 /\u1794 4 \u5172 .\n\n\u517116\u5172\n\nHere n u is the upper limit of the concentration of the current\ncarriers, defined by Eq. \u517116\u5172. On the other hand, to consider\nthe current carriers as noninteracting, we should find much\nless \u5171on the average\u5172 than one current carrier inside the\nsphere of a Debye screening radius. In this case every current\ncarrier is screened from the influence of the others. Thus\n3\n\u2c061, and it follows that\n4 \u2432 n/3q D\nn\u2c07n l \u2afd \u5171 1/36\u2432 \u5172\u5171 \u2427kT/e \u5172 .\n2 3\n\n\u517117\u5172\n\nHere n l is the lower limit of the concentration of the current\ncarriers, defined by Eq. \u517117\u5172. The inequalities \u517116\u5172 and \u517117\u5172\ncan be combined to give\nn l \u2c06n\u2c06n u .\n\n\u517118\u5172\n\nFor m equal to the electron mass, \u2427\u2afd5, and T\u2afd300 K, we\nhave n l \u2afd6.41\u2afb1015 cm\u2afa3 and n u \u2afd1.82\u2afb1020 cm\u2afa3 . Because the concentration of the current carriers in semiconductors is about 1017 \u2013 1018 cm\u2afa3 , 6 the inequalities in Eq.\n\u517118\u5172 are satisfied by the properties of many materials.\nVI. BIPOLARON\nLet us consider two identical particles in a potential well.\nTwo current carriers in a self-consistent potential well are\ncalled a bipolaron.2\u2013 4 Bipolarons play an important role in\nsolid state physics, and they can be superconducting current\ncarriers in some materials.3 Both of the charged particles of a\nbipolaron occupy the ground state \u5171they could be bosons or\nfermions with opposite spins in general\u5172. Let \u243a, \u2433, E(r),\nE 0 (r), and E d (r) be the same as before for each particle. It\n3\n\nfollows from Eq. \u51719\u5172 that the potential for the two particles,\neach one with charge e \u5171the total charge is 2e), is\nW \u5171 r \u5172 \u2afd\u2afa \u5171 4/\u2432 1/2\u5172\u5173\u5171 \u2427\u2afa1 \u5172 /\u2427 \u5174 e 2 g\n\u2af9 \u5171 4/3\u2432 1/2\u5172\u5173\u5171 \u2427\u2afa1 \u5172 /\u2427 \u5174 e 2 g 3 r 2 \u2af9 \u0304 .\n\n\u517119\u5172\n\nThe last term on the right-hand side of Eq. \u517119\u5172 is equal to\n0.5m \u243b 2b r 2 . It follows that\n\n\u243b b \u2afd \u5171 2 3/2/31/2\u2432 1/4\u5172\u5173\u5171 \u2427\u2afa1 \u5172 /\u2427 \u5174 1/2\u5171 e/m 1/2\u5172 g 3/2.\n\n\u517120\u5172\n\nThe direct interaction energy of the identical particles\nshould be taken into account. It is determined by the integral\nof 2E 20 (r) over all space divided by 8\u2432. This integral yields\nW i \u2afd \u5171 2/\u2432 \u5172 1/2e 2 g.\n\n\u517121\u5172\n\nThe energy of the two particles in the ground state of a\npotential well is 3\u1794 \u243b b . In an autolocalized state the sum of\nthis energy and W i is smaller than the depth of the potential\nwell (4/\u2432 1/2) \u5173 (\u2427\u2afa1)/\u2427 \u5174 e 2 g \u5173see Eq. \u517119\u5172\u5174. It follows that\n0\u2b0dg 1/2\u2b0d \u5171 1/23/23 1/2\u2432 1/4\u5172\u5173\u5171 \u2427\u2afa1 \u5172 /\u2427 \u5174 1/2\u5175 \u5173\u5171 4\u2afa2 1/2\u5172 \u2427\u2afa4 \u5174 /\n\u5171 \u2427\u2afa1 \u5172 \u5176 \u5171 m 1/2e/\u1794 \u5172 .\n\n\u517122\u5172\n\nEquation \u517122\u5172 is the condition for the existence of at least\none localized level in a self-consistent potential well. Note\nthat g 1/2 is positive when \u2427\u2b0e4/(4\u2afa2 1/2)\u2afd1.55 only. When\ng 1/2 is negative, there is no localization because the wave\nfunction is not localized. The direct interaction of the two\nparticles results in an increase of the energy of the system.\nThe attractive interaction of the particles with the polarization of the medium leads to a decrease of the energy. But if\n\u2427 is not big enough, this decrease is not sufficiently large to\ncompensate for the energy increase due to the repulsion of\ntwo particles. In this case the resulting potential well is not\ndeep enough and the ground state cannot be formed. In such\nmaterials a bipolaron does not exist.\nThe total energy of the system of two particles follows\nfrom Eqs. \u517119\u5172\u2013\u517121\u5172 and is given by\nW \u5171 g \u5172 \u2afd \u5171 2 3/23 1/2/ \u2432 1/4\u5172\u5173\u5171 \u2427\u2afa1 \u5172 /\u2427 \u5174 1/2\u5171 e\u1794/m 1/2\u5172 g 3/2\n\u2af9 \u5171 2/\u2432 \u5172 1/2e 2 g\u2afa \u5171 4/\u2432 1/2\u5172\u5173\u5171 \u2427\u2afa1 \u5172 /\u2427 \u5174 e 2 g.\n\n\u517123\u5172\n\nThe minimum of this energy corresponds to\n1/2 3/2 1/4\n1/2\n1/2\ng 1/2\ne \u2afd \u5171 1/2 3 \u2432 \u5172\u5173\u5171 \u2427\u2afa1 \u5172 /\u2427 \u5174 \u5175 \u5173\u5171 4\u2afa2 \u5172 \u2427\u2afa4 \u5174 /\u2427 \u5176\n\n\u2afb\u5171 m 1/2e/\u1794 \u5172 .\n\n\u517124\u5172\n\n1/2\nWe can see that g 1/2\ne is positive for \u2427\u2b0e4/(4\u2afa2 )\u2afd1.55, in\naccord with the previous result. Equation \u517124\u5172 can be rewritten as\n\ng e \u2afd \u5171 1/54\u2432 1/2\u5172\u5173\u5171 \u2427\u2afa1 \u5172 /\u2427 \u5174 \u5175 \u5173\u5171 4\u2afa2 1/2\u5172 \u2427\u2afa4 \u5174 /\u2427 \u5176 2 \u5171 me 2 /\u1794 2 \u5172 .\n\u517125\u5172\nFor \u2427\u2afd5, Eq. \u517125\u5172 yields g e \u2afd0.0416(me 2 /\u1794 2 ). This value\nof the inverse of the autolocalization radius is much smaller\nthan that calculated from Eq. \u517113\u5172, which means that the\nlocalization radius of a bipolaron is much larger than that of\nan autolocalized single charged particle.\nThe equilibrium energy of the system according to Eq.\n\u517123\u5172 is\nW \u5171 g e \u5172 \u2afd\u2afa \u5171 1/162\u2432 \u5172 \u5175 \u5173\u5171 4\u2afa2 12\u5172 \u2427\u2afa4 \u5174 3 /\n\u2427 2 \u5171 \u2427\u2afa1 \u5172 \u5176 \u5171 me 4 /\u1794 2 \u5172 .\n\n\u517126\u5172\n\n\fAgain the minimum energy W(g e ) is positive for \u2427\u2b0e4/(4\n\u2afa2 1/2)\u2afd1.55, in accord with our previous result. For \u2427\u2afd5,\nthe minimum energy W(g e )\u2afd\u2afa0.0140(me 4 /\u1794 2 ), which is\nmuch smaller than the binding energy of two separate particles. The autolocalized state of two particles \u5171bipolaron\u5172 is\na metastable state because its minimum energy is higher than\nthat of the two separate particles.\n\nand c is the speed of light in vacuum. Equation \u517127\u5172 is valid\nfor r smaller than \u1794/mc. 8 The first term in Eq. \u517127\u5172 describes\nthe part of the potential produced by the bare charged particle, while the second term describes the part of the potential, produced by the polarization of the vacuum.\nBecause there is no self-interaction in nature, the part of\nthe electrostatic potential that acts on the particle is \u5173see Eq.\n\u517127\u5172\u5174\n\nVII. DISCUSSION\n\n\u2438 a \u5171 r \u5172 \u2afd\u2afa \u5171 2 \u2423 e/3\u2432 r \u5172\u5173 1.41\u2afalog \u5171 \u1794/mcr \u5172\u5174 .\n\nWe have proposed a model that describes the concept of\nautolocalization. The advantage of this model is that it allows\nus to study the basic concepts of autolocalization without\nusing complicated and mainly numerical calculations.\nWe have shown that localized states can form in a regular\ndielectric or semiconductor with a sufficient \u5171but not too\nhigh\u5172 density of current carriers. Only one \u5171ground\u5172 level can\nbe formed in a polarization potential well. If the dielectric\nconstant is greater than 1.55, bipolaron states could exist as\nmetastable states, because the binding energy of two separate\ncurrent carriers is larger than the binding energy of the two\ncarriers in one bipolaron well. Thus, it is obvious that there\nexists only one state in our model of a bipolaron polarization\nwell. The localization radius of a bipolaron is considerably\nlarger than that of a polaron.\nOf course, reality is much more complicated than the\nmodel discussed here. Several excited levels of a polaron and\nbipolaron can exist, which also influence the properties of\nsolids.3,4\nVIII. SUGGESTED PROBLEM\nConsider a charged particle in a vacuum. Calculate and\nanalyze the part of the electrostatic potential that acts on the\nparticle.\nSolution: It is well known in quantum electrodynamics\nthat near the point charge in a vacuum, the electrostatic potential has the form8\n\n\u2438 \u5171 r \u5172 \u2afd \u5171 e/r \u5172 \u2afa \u5171 2 \u2423 e/3\u2432 r \u5172\u5173 1.41\u2afalog \u5171 \u1794/mcr \u5172\u5174 ,\n\n\u517127\u5172\n\nwhere \u2423 is a constant, m is the \u5171bare\u5172 mass of the particle,8\n\n4\n\n\u517128\u5172\n\nTo analyze this potential we introduce the notation x\n\u2afd\u1794/mcr.

It looks like that at such a deep energy minimum the wave function of the particle can be localized within the sphere of radius r e . But the potential of the well,\n\u2438 a (r), in the vicinity of the energy minimum is almost zero\nfor r\u2b0er e . So the well is very narrow, kinetic energy is very\nhigh and the localization at r\u2b07r e is impossible as expected.\na\u5172\n\nElectronic mail: jacqie@bluewin.ch\nH. Frohlich, H. Pelzer, and S.
