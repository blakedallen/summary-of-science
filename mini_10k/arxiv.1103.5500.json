HARTWIG\n\n1. Introduction\nLet R be an algebra, \u03c31 , . . . , \u03c3n commuting algebra automorphisms of R, t1 , . . . , tn elements\nfrom the center of R, and \u03bcij an n \u00d7 n matrix of invertible scalars. To these data one associates\na twisted generalized Weyl algebra A\u03bc (R, \u03c3, t), an associative Zn -graded algebra (see Section 2.1\nfor definition). These algebras were introduced by Mazorchuk and Turowska [17] and they are\ngeneralizations of the much studied generalized Weyl algebras, defined independently by Bavula\n[2], Jordan [13], and Rosenberg [20] (called there hyperbolic rings).\nSimple weight modules over twisted generalized Weyl algebras have been studied in [17],[16],[9].\nIn [18] the authors classified bounded and unbounded \u2217-representations over twisted generalized\nWeyl algebras. Interesting examples of twisted generalized Weyl algebras were given in [16]. In\n[10] new examples of twisted generalized Weyl algebras were constructed from symmetric Cartan\nmatrices.\nIn this paper we define a family of twisted generalized Weyl algebras, called multiparameter\ntwisted Weyl algebras. This definition was inspired by an unpublished note by Benkart [4] where\nmultiparameter Weyl algebras were introduced. These algebras are a particular case of the algebras\nof our class.\nMultiparameter quantized Weyl algebras Anq\u0304,\u039b were introduced in [15] as a generalization of the\nquantized Weyl algebras obtained by Pusz and Woronowicz [19] in the context of quantum group\ncovariant differential calculus. They are examples of twisted generalized Weyl algebras. Contrary\nto the usual Weyl algebras the algebra, Aq\u0304,\u039b\nn is in general not simple, even for generic parameters.\nJordan [14] found a certain natural simple localization of Aq\u0304,\u039b\nn .\nThe first main theorem of the paper parametrizes simple quotients of multiparameter twisted\nWeyl algebras in terms of maximal ideals of certain Laurent polynomial rings. Jordan's localization\nof Aq\u0304,\u039b\nis an example in this family, as well as Hayashi's q-deformed Weyl algebras [12].\nn\nTheorem A. Let A = Akn (r, s, \u039b) be a multiparameter twisted Weyl algebra.\n(a) The assignment\n(1.1)\n\nn 7\u2192 A/hni\n\nwhere hni denotes the ideal in A generated by n, is a bijection between the set of maximal\nn\nideals in the invariant subring RZ and the set of simple quotients of A in which all Xi , Yi (i =\n1, . . . , n) are regular.\nn\n(b) For any n \u2208 Specm(RZ ), the quotient A/hni is isomorphic to the twisted generalized Weyl\nalgebra A\u03bc (R/Rn, \u03c3\u0304, t\u0304), where \u03c3\u0304g (r + Rn) = \u03c3g (r) + Rn, \u2200g \u2208 Zn , r \u2208 R and t\u0304i = ti + Rn, \u2200i.\nn\n(c) A/hni is a domain for all n \u2208 Specm(RZ ) if and only if Z2n /G is torsion-free, where G is\nn\nthe gradation group of RZ .\nThe second main theorem of the paper gives the explicit relation between four twisted generalized Weyl algebras, namely the multiparameter quantized Weyl algebra Aq\u0304,\u039b\nn , Jordan's localization\nBnq\u0304,\u039b , a specific multiparameter twisted Weyl algebra Akn (r, s, \u039b) that we define, and a certain quotient Akn\\\n(r, s, \u039b) of it which is simple and isomorphic to Bnq\u0304,\u039b .\nTheorem B. We have a commutative diagram in the category of Zn -graded algebras:\nAkn (r, s, \u039b)\nMMM\nMMM\nMMM\n\u000f\u000f\nMM& &\n\u2243\n/ q\u0304,\u039b\n\\\nk\no\nBn\nAn (r, s, \u039b)\nO\nfMMM\nMMM\nMMM\nMM \u001f\n3 S ?q\u0304,\u039b\nAn\nWe end the introduction with an overview of the content of this paper. In Sections 3 and 4,\nwe first consider certain families of twisted generalized Weyl algebras.

Twisted generalized Weyl algebras\nThroughout this section we fix a commutative ring k.\n2.1. Definition. We recall the definition of twisted generalized Weyl algebras [17, 16]. Here we\nemphasize the initial data more than usual, which will be useful in the next section to express the\nfunctoriality of the construction.\nDefinition 2.1 (TGW datum). Let n a positive integer. A twisted generalized Weyl datum (over\nk of degree n) is a triple (R, \u03c3, t) where\n\u2022 R is a unital associative k-algebra,\n\u2022 \u03c3 is a group homomorphism \u03c3 : Zn \u2192 Autk (R), g 7\u2192 \u03c3g ,\n\u2022 t is a function t : {1, . . . , n} \u2192 Z(R), i 7\u2192 ti .\nA morphism between TGW data over k of degree n,\n\u03c6 : (R, \u03c3, t) \u2192 (R\u2032 , \u03c3 \u2032 , t\u2032 )\nis a k-algebra morphism \u03c6 : R \u2192 R\u2032 such that \u03c6\u03c3i = \u03c3i\u2032 \u03c6 and \u03c6(ti ) = t\u2032i for all i \u2208 {1, . . . , n}.\nWe let TGWn (k) denote the category whose objects are the TGW data over k of degree n and\nmorphisms are as above.\nFor i \u2208 {1, . . . , n} we put \u03c3i = \u03c3ei , where {ei }ni=1 is the standard Z-basis for Zn . A parameter\nmatrix (over k\u00d7 of size n) is an n \u00d7 n matrix \u03bc = (\u03bcij )i6=j without diagonal where \u03bcij \u2208 k\u00d7 \u2200i 6= j.\nThe set of all parameter matrices over k\u00d7 of size n will be denoted by PMn (k).\nDefinition 2.2 (TGW construction). Let n \u2208 Z>0 , (R, \u03c3, t) be an object in TGWn (k), and\n\u03bc \u2208 PMn (k). The twisted generalized Weyl construction with parameter matrix \u03bc associated to\nthe TGW datum (R, \u03c3, t) is denoted by C\u03bc (R, \u03c3, t) and is defined as the free R-ring on the set\n{xi , yi | i = 1, . . . , n} modulo two-sided ideal generated by the following set of elements:\n(2.1a)\n(2.1b)\n(2.1c)\n\nxi r \u2212 \u03c3i (r)xi ,\nyi xi \u2212 ti ,\n\nyi r \u2212 \u03c3i\u22121 (r)yi ,\nxi yi \u2212 \u03c3i (ti ),\nxi yj \u2212 \u03bcij yj xi ,\n\n\u2200r \u2208 R, i \u2208 {1, . . . , n},\n\u2200i \u2208 {1, . . . , n},\n\u2200i, j \u2208 {1, . . . , n}, i 6= j.\n\nbi , Ybi respectively. The ring\nThe images in C\u03bc (R, \u03c3, t) of the elements xi , yi will be denoted by X\nn\nb\nb\nC\u03bc (R, \u03c3, t) has a Z -gradation given by requiring deg Xi = ei , deg Yi = \u2212ei , deg r = 0 \u2200r \u2208 R. Let\nI\u03bc (R, \u03c3, t) \u2286 C\u03bc (R, \u03c3, t) be the sum of all graded ideals J \u2286 C\u03bc (R, \u03c3, t) having zero intersection with\nthe degree zero component, i.e. such that C\u03bc (R, \u03c3, t)0 \u2229 J = {0}. It is easy to see that I\u03bc (R, \u03c3, t)\nis the unique maximal graded ideal having zero intersection with the degree zero component.\n\n\f4\n\nVYACHESLAV FUTORNY AND JONAS T. HARTWIG\n\nDefinition 2.3 (TGW algebra). The twisted generalized Weyl algebra with parameter matrix\n\u03bc associated to the TGW datum (R, \u03c3, t) is denoted A\u03bc (R, \u03c3, t) and is defined as the quotient\nA\u03bc (R, \u03c3, t) := C\u03bc (R, \u03c3, t)/I\u03bc (R, \u03c3, t).\nSince I\u03bc (R, \u03c3, t) is graded, A\u03bc (R, \u03c3, t) inherits a Zn -gradation from C\u03bc (R, \u03c3, t). The images in\nbi , Ybi will be denoted by Xi , Yi . By a monic monomial in a TGW\nA\u03bc (R, \u03c3, t) of the elements X\nconstruction C\u03bc (R, \u03c3, t) (respectively TGW algebra A\u03bc (R, \u03c3, t)) we will mean a product of elements\nbi , Ybi | i = 1, . . . , n} (respectively {Xi , Yi | i = 1, . . . , n}).\nfrom {X\nThe following statements are easy to check.\n\nLemma 2.4. (a) A\u03bc (R, \u03c3, t) (respectively C\u03bc (R, \u03c3, t)) is generated as a left and as a right Rbi , Ybi (i = 1, . . . , n)).\nmodule by the monic monomials in Xi , Yi (i = 1, . . . , n) (respectively X\n(b) The degree zero component of A\u03bc (R, \u03c3, t) is equal to the image of R under the natural map\n\u03c1 : R \u2192 A\u03bc (R, \u03c3, t).\n(c) Any nonzero graded ideal of A\u03bc (R, \u03c3, t) has nonzero intersection with the degree zero component.\nDefinition 2.5 (\u03bc-Consistency). Let (R, \u03c3, t) be a TGW datum over k of degree n and \u03bc be a\nparameter matrix over k\u00d7 of size n. We say that (R, \u03c3, t) is \u03bc-consistent if the canonical map\n\u03c1 : R \u2192 A\u03bc (R, \u03c3, t) is injective.\nSince I\u03bc (R, \u03c3, t) has zero intersection with the zero-component, (R, \u03c3, t) is \u03bc-consistent iff the\ncanonical map R \u2192 C\u03bc (R, \u03c3, t) is injective. Even in the cases when \u03c1 is not injective, we will often\nview A\u03bc (R, \u03c3, t) as a left R-module and write for example rXi instead of \u03c1(r)Xi .\nDefinition 2.6 (Regularity). A TGW datum (R, \u03c3, t) is called regular if ti is regular in R for all\ni.\nThe following result was proved in [8, Theorem 6.2].\nTheorem 2.7. Let k be a commutative unital ring, R be an associative k-algebra, n a positive\ningeter, t = (t1 , . . . , tn ) be an n-tuple of regular central elements of R, \u03c3 : Zn \u2192 Autk (R) a\ngroup homomorphism, \u03bcij (i, j = 1, . . . , n, i 6= j) invertible elements from k, and A\u03bc (R, \u03c3, t)\nthe corresponding twisted generalized Weyl algebra, equipped with the canonical homomorphism of\nR-rings \u03c1 : R \u2192 A\u03bc (R, \u03c3, t). Then the following two statements are equivalent:\n(a) \u03c1 is injective,\n(b) the following two sets of relations are satisfied in R:\n(2.2)\n\n\u03c3i \u03c3j (ti tj ) = \u03bcij \u03bcji \u03c3i (ti )\u03c3j (tj ),\n\n(2.3)\n\ntj \u03c3i \u03c3k (tj ) = \u03c3i (tj )\u03c3k (tj ),\n\n\u2200i, j = 1, . . . , n, i 6= j,\n\u2200i, j, k = 1, . . . , n, i 6= j 6= k 6= i.\n\nIn particular, if (2.2) and (2.3) are satisfied, then A\u03bc (R, \u03c3, t) is nontrivial iff R is nontrivial.\nMoreover, neither of the two conditions (2.2) and (2.3) imply the other.\nLemma 2.8. If ti \u2208 R\u00d7 for all i, then the canonical projection C\u03bc (R, \u03c3, t) \u2192 A\u03bc (R, \u03c3, t) is an\nisomorphism.\nProof. The algebra C\u03bc (R, \u03c3, t) is a Zn -crossed product algebra over its degree zero subalgebra,\nsince each homogenous component contains an invertible element. Indeed since ti \u2208 R\u00d7 , each Xi\nis invertible and thus X1g1 * * * Xngn has degree g and is invertible. Therefore any nonzero graded ideal\nin C\u03bc (R, \u03c3, t) has nonzero intersection with the degree zero component, a property which holds for\nany strongly graded ring, in particular for crossed product algebras. Thus I\u03bc (R, \u03c3, t) = 0, which\nproves the claim.\n\u0003\n2.2. TGW algebras which are domains. The following condition for a TGW algebra to be a\ndomain will be used.\nProposition 2.9. Let A = A\u03bc (R, \u03c3, t) be a twisted generalized Weyl algebra where (R, \u03c3, t) is\n\u03bc-consistent. Then A is a domain if and only if R is a domain.\n\n\fMULTIPARAMETER TWISTED WEYL ALGEBRAS\n\n5\n\nProof. Clearly R must be a domain if A is a domain. For the converse, assume R is a domain and\nsuppose a, b \u2208 A are nonzero but ab = 0. Let ag and bh be the leading terms in a and b respectively,\nwith respect to some order (we use here that the group Zn is orderable). Then ag bh = 0. As in\nthe proof of [10, Proposition 3.1] this forces ag = 0 or bh = 0 which is a contradiction.\n\u0003\n3. Finitistic TGW algebras\nThroughout the rest of the paper we assume that k is a field.\nIn [10] the following notion (there called \"locally finite\" TGW algebra) was defined.\nDefinition 3.1. A TGW algebra A = A\u03bc (R, \u03c3, t) is called k-finitistic if dimk Vij < \u221e for all\ni, j \u2208 {1, . . . , n}, where\nVij = Spank {\u03c3ik (tj ) | k \u2208 Z}.\n\n(3.1)\n\nFor each i, j, we denote by pij \u2208 k[x] be the minimal polynomial for \u03c3i acting on the finitedimensional space Vij . The following result was proved in [10] (for the case \u03bcij = \u03bcji and R a\ncommutative domain, but these restrictions are unnecessary).\nTheorem 3.2. Let A = A\u03bc (R, \u03c3, t) be a k-finitistic TGW algebra where (R, \u03c3, t) is \u03bc-consistent.\nLet pij be the minimal polynomials defined above.\n(a) Define the matrix CA = (aij ) with integer entries as follows:\n(\n2,\ni = j,\n(3.2)\naij =\n1 \u2212 deg pij , i 6= j.\nThen CA is a generalized Cartan matrix.\n(b) Assume ti is regular in R for all i.

If CA is of type Z (for example An , Bn , Cn , Dn , E6 , E7 , E8 etc) we say that A is of\nLie type Z.\nHere we note that the polynomials pii also give rise to identities in A.\nTheorem 3.3. Let A = A\u03bc (R, \u03c3, t) be a k-finitistic TGW algebra, where (R, \u03c3, t) is regular and\n\u03bc-consistent. Let pii \u2208 k[x] be the minimal polynomial for \u03c3i acting on the finite-dimensional\nspaces Vii defined in (3.1). Writing\n(mii )\n\n(1)\n\npii (x) = xmii + \u03bbii xmii \u22121 + * * * + \u03bbii\n\n,\n\n(k)\n\nwhere all \u03bbii \u2208 k, the following identities hold in A, for any i:\n(3.5)\n\n(1)\n\n(mii )\n\n(1)\n\n(mii )\n\nXimii Yi + \u03bbii Ximii \u22121 Yi Xi + * * * + \u03bbii\n\nYi Ximii = 0\n\nand\n(3.6)\n\nXi Yimii + \u03bbii Yi Xi Yimii \u22121 + * * * + \u03bbii\n\nYimii Xi = 0.\n\nm\u2212k\nXi Yik }m\nMoreover, for any i and m < mii , the sets {Xim\u2212k Yi Xik }m\nk=0 are linearly\nk=0 and {Yi\nindependent in A over k.\n\nProof. The proof is similar to the proof of Theorem 3.2.\n\n\u0003\n\n\f6\n\nVYACHESLAV FUTORNY AND JONAS T. HARTWIG\n\nExample 3.4. Let R = k[t1 , . . . , tn ] be the polynomial algebra, \u03c3i (tj ) = tj \u2212 \u03b4ij , \u03bcij \u2208 k\\{0}\nsuch that \u03bcij \u03bcji = 1. Let A = A\u03bc (R, \u03c3, t) be the associated TGW algebra. It is easy to see that\nit is k-finitistic. For i = j, the minimal polynomials are pii (x) = (x \u2212 1)2 . For i 6= j we have\npij (x) = x\u22121. The matrix CA , defined in (3.2), is the Cartan matrix of type (A1 )n = A1 \u00d7* * *\u00d7A1\n(just a diagonal matrix with 2 on the diagonal). Thus A is of Lie type (A1 )n . By (3.3) we have\nXi Xj = \u03bc\u22121\nij Xj Xi for i 6= j. If all \u03bcij = 1 then A is isomorphic to the n:th Weyl algebra.\nExample 3.5. The following TGW algebra was first mentioned as an example in [17], but a\ncomplete presentation by generators and relations was only given in [10]. Let n = 2, R = k[H],\n\u03c31 (H) = H + 1, \u03c32 (H) = H \u2212 1, t1 = H, t2 = H + 1, \u03bc12 = \u03bc21 = 1 and let A = A\u03bc (R, \u03c3, t) be the\nassociated TGW algebra. Clearly A is locally finite with Vij = CH \u2295 C1 for i, j = 1, 2. Observing\nthat \u03c32 (t1 ) and t1 are linearly independent and that\n\u03c322 (t1 ) \u2212 2\u03c32 (t1 ) + t1 = H \u2212 2 \u2212 2(H \u2212 1) + H = 0\nwe see that the minimal polynomial p21 for \u03c32 acting on V21 is given by p21 (x) = x2 \u2212 2x\n1=\n\u0003\n\u0002 2+\u22121\n(x \u2212 1)2 . Similarly one checks that in fact pij (x) = (x \u2212 1)2 for all i, j = 1, 2. Thus CA = \u22121\n2 ,\nthe Cartan matrix of type A2 , so A is of Lie type A2 . By Theorem 3.2b), we have for example\nX12 X2 \u2212 2X1 X2 X2 + X2 X12 = 0 in A, which is precisely one of the Serre relations in the enveloping\nalgebra of sl3 (k), the simple Lie algebra of type A2 . It was shown in [10, Example 6.3] that in fact\nA is isomorphic to the k-algebra with generators X1 , X2 , Y1 , Y2 , H and defining relations\nX1 H = (H + 1)X1 ,\n\nX2 H = (H \u2212 1)X2 ,\n\nY1 H = (H \u2212 1)Y1 ,\n\nY2 H = (H + 1)Y2 ,\n\nY1 X1 = X2 Y2 = H,\n\nX12 X2 \u2212 2X1 X2 X1 + X2 X12 = 0,\nX22 X1 \u2212 2X2 X1 X2 + X1 X22 = 0,\nY12 Y2 \u2212 2Y1 Y2 Y1 + Y2 Y12 = 0,\n\nY2 X2 = X1 Y1 = H + 1,\n\nY22 Y1 \u2212 2Y2 Y1 Y2 + Y1 Y22 = 0.\n\nIn [10], this TGW algebra was also generalized to arbitrary symmetric generalized Cartan matrices,\nalthough explicit presentation was only given in type A2 .\n4. TGW algebras of Lie type (A1 )n\n4.1. Presentation by generators and relations. Let A = A\u03bc (R, \u03c3, t) be a k-finitistic TGW\nalgebra of Lie type (A1 )n = A1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 A1 , with (R, \u03c3, t) being \u03bc-consistent. Thus CA has all zeros\noutside the main diagonal. That is, deg pij = 1 for all i 6= j. Equivalently (since pij are monic by\ndefinition), for i 6= j we have pij (x) = x \u2212 \u03b3ij for some \u03b3ij \u2208 k\\{0}. By Theorem 3.2, this means\nthat in A we have\n\u22121\nXi Xj = \u03b3ij \u03bcij\nXj Xi\n\n(4.1a)\n(4.1b)\n\n\u2200i 6= j,\n\n\u03b3ij \u03bc\u22121\nji Yi Yj\n\nYj Yi =\n\n\u2200i 6= j.\n\nIt also means that\n(4.2)\n\n\u03c3i (tj ) = \u03b3ij tj\n\nfor all i 6= j.\n\nBy Theorem 2.7, (R, \u03c3, t) is \u03bc-consistent if and only if\n(4.3)\n\n\u03bcij \u03bcji = \u03b3ij \u03b3ji\n\n\u2200i 6= j.\n\nWe can now prove that (4.1) generate all relations in the ideal I\u03bc (R, \u03c3, t).\nTheorem 4.1. Let A = A\u03bc (R, \u03c3, t) is a k-finitistic TGW algebra of type (A1 )n , where (R, \u03c3, t)\nis regular and \u03bc-consistent (i.e. (4.3) holds). Then A is isomorphic to the R-ring generated by\nX1 , . . . , Xn , Y1 , . . . , Yn modulo the relations\n(4.4)\n(4.5)\n\nXi r = \u03c3i (r)Xi ,\nYi Xi = ti ,\nXi Yj = \u03bcij Yj Xi ,\n\nXi Xj =\n\nYi r = \u03c3i\u22121 (r)Yi\nXi Yi = \u03c3i (ti ),\n\n\u03b3ij \u03bc\u22121\nij Xj Xi ,\n\n\u2200r \u2208 R, \u2200i,\n\u2200i,\n\nYj Yi = \u03b3ij \u03bc\u22121\nji Yi Yj ,\n\n\u2200i 6= j.\n\n\fMULTIPARAMETER TWISTED WEYL ALGEBRAS\n\n7\n\nProof. The statement is equivalent to that the ideal I := I\u03bc (R, \u03c3, t) of the TGW construction\nA\u2032 = C\u03bc (R, \u03c3, t) used to construct A is generated by the set\n\b\n\u22121\n(4.6)\nXi Xj \u2212 \u03b3ij \u03bc\u22121\nij Xj Xi , Yj Yi \u2212 \u03b3ij \u03bcji Yi Yj | i 6= j .\n\nLet J denote the ideal in A\u2032 generated by (4.6). Assume a \u2208 I. We will prove that a \u2208 J. Since\nI is graded, we can without loss of generality assume that a is homogenous. Let g = deg a \u2208 Zn .\nWithout loss of generality we can also add to a any element of J, and thus can rearrange the Y 's\nand the X's in the terms in a so to obtain\n(g1 )\n\na = rZ1\n\n* * * Zn(gn )\n(\u2212g )\n\n(k)\n\n(\u2212g )\n\nfor some r \u2208 R, where Zi equals Xik if k \u2265 0 and Yi\u2212k otherwise. Put b = Zn n * * * Z1 1 .\nThen ab has degree zero so that ab \u2208 I \u2229 R = {0}, forcing ab = 0. On the other hand, using\n(2.1a),(2.1b) repeatedly we have ab = rs where s \u2208 R is a product of elements of the form \u03c3g (ti )\n(g \u2208 Zn , i \u2208 {1, . . . , n}). Since the ti are assumed to be regular in R we must have r = 0, i.e.\na = 0 \u2208 J.\n\u0003\n4.2. Centralizer intersections and a simplicity criterion. Let G be a group acting by automorphisms on a ring R. An ideal J of R is called G-invariant if g(J) \u2286 J for all g \u2208 G. The ring\nR is called G-simple if the only G-invariant ideals are R and {0}. If A \u2286 B are rings, then we\nlet CB (A) denote the centralizer of A in B: CB (A) = {b \u2208 B | ba = ab \u2200a \u2208 A}. In [11, Th. 3.6,\nTh. 7.18] the following statements are proved.\nTheorem 4.2. (a) Let A = A\u03bc (R, \u03c3, t) be a TGW algebra where R is commutative and (R, \u03c3, t)\nis \u03bc-consistent. Let J be any nonzero ideal of A. Then J \u2229 CA (R) 6= 0.\n(b) Let A = A\u03bc (R, \u03c3, t) be a TGW algebra, and assume (R, \u03c3, t) is \u03bc-consistent. Suppose A is kfinitistic of Lie type (A1 )n . Then A is simple if and only if (1) R is Zn -simple, (2) Z(A) \u2286 R,\nand (3) Rti + R\u03c3id (ti ) = R for all d \u2208 Z>0 and i = 1, . . . , n.\nPart (b) is proved in [11, Th. 7.18] in the more general context of so called R-finitistic TGW\nalgebras. The result is a generalization of D. Jordan's simplicity criterion for generalized Weyl\nalgebras [13, Theorem 6.1].\n5. Multiparameter twisted Weyl algebras\nNow we define a special class of twisted generalized Weyl algebras.

Thus, by\nTheorem 2.7, the TGW datum (R, \u03c3, t) is \u03bc-consistent, that is, the natural map \u03c1 : R \u2192 A\u03bc (R, \u03c3, t)\nis injective. We denote the TGW algebra A\u03bc (R, \u03c3, t) by Akn (r, s, \u039b) and call it a multiparameter\ntwisted Weyl algebra. It is easy to see that it is k-finitistic of Lie type (A1 )n and thus, by Theorem\n\u00b11\n4.1, Akn (r, s, \u039b) is isomorphic to the unital associative k-algebra generated by u\u00b11\ni , vi , Xi , Yi (i =\n1, . . . , n) modulo the relations\n\u00b11\nthe u\u00b11\nall commute and ui u\u22121\n= vi vi\u22121 = 1 \u2200i,\ni , vj\ni\n\u0001\nrji k\n\u03bbij Xj Xi \u2200i, j,\nXi Xj =\nrij\nYi Yj = \u03bbij Yj Yi \u2200i, j,\n\n(5.6a)\n(5.6b)\n(5.6c)\n\n\u2212k\nXi Yj = rji\n\u03bbji Yj Xi\n\n(5.6d)\n\nk\n\n\u2200i 6= j,\n\nk\n\n(5.6e)\n\nYi Xi =\n\n(rii ui ) \u2212 (sii vi )\n,\nk \u2212 sk\nrii\nii\n\n(5.6f)\n\n\u22121\nu j Xi ,\nXi uj = rij\n\nXi vj = s\u22121\nij vj Xi ,\n\nXi Yi =\n\nuki \u2212 vik\nk \u2212 sk\nrii\nii\n\nYi uj = rij uj Yi ,\n\n\u2200i,\n\nYi vj = sij vj Yi\n\n\u2200i, j.\n\nRemark 5.1. One can also consider the larger class of algebras in which (5.1b) in the definition\nk\nof Akn (r, s, \u039b) is replaced by the weaker condition that rii\n6= skii for all i.

So if g \u2208 Zn , g 6= h, then there is a d \u2208 Z2n such that \u03c3h (ud ) 6= \u03c3g (ud ).

In particular, for each n \u2208 Specm(RZ ), Rn is maximal among Zn -invariant ideals of R and\nn\nconversely, every maximal Zn -invariant ideal of R equals Rn for some n \u2208 Specm(RZ ).\nProof. We can view R as a module over k[Zn ] by linearly extending the Zn -action on R. Let\nk[Zn ]\u2217 be the group of characters (i.e. algebra morphisms k[Zn ] \u2192 k). The product is given by\n\u03c71 \u03c72 (g) = \u03c71 (g)\u03c72 (g) for \u03c71 , \u03c72 \u2208 k[Zn ]\u2217 , g \u2208 Zn . By definition of \u03c3i , there is for each d \u2208 Z2n a\n\u03c7 \u2208 k[Zn ]\u2217 such that \u03c3g (ud ) = \u03c7(g)ud for all g \u2208 Zn . Thus\nM\nR[\u03c7], R[\u03c7] = {r \u2208 R | a.r = \u03c7(a)r \u2200a \u2208 k[Zn ]}.\n(5.8)\nR=\n\u03c7\u2208k[Zn ]\u2217\n\nIn particular R is semisimple as a module over k[Zn ]. Using that each R[\u03c7] is spanned by certain\nud , one verifies that the decomposition (5.8) turns R into a strongly k[Zn ]\u2217 -graded ring, that is,\nn\nR[\u03c71 ]R[\u03c72 ] = R[\u03c71 \u03c72 ] for all \u03c71 , \u03c72 \u2208 k[Zn ]\u2217 . Moreover RZ = R[1] where 1 is the unit in the\ncharacter group k[Zn ]\u2217 , given by 1(g) = 1 for all g \u2208 Zn .\nn\nWe now show the maps \u03b5 and \u03c1 are inverses to eachother.\nL Let J be any Z -invariant ideal of\nn\nR. Thus it is a k[Z ]-submodule of R, and therefore J = \u03c7\u2208k[Zn ]\u2217 J[\u03c7], where J[\u03c7] = R[\u03c7] \u2229 J.\nUsing the strong gradation property we have J[\u03c7] = R[\u03c7]R[\u03c7\u22121 ]J[\u03c7] \u2286 R[\u03c7]J[1] \u2286 J[\u03c7] which\nn\nproves that J[\u03c7] = R[\u03c7]J[1] for all \u03c7. P\nThus J = R(J \u2229 RZ ). This shows that \u03b5\u03c1 is the identity.\nn\nn\nLet n be an ideal of RZ . Then Rn = \u03c7\u2208k[Zn ]\u2217 R[\u03c7]n and R[\u03c7]n \u2286 R[\u03c7]. Thus (Rn) \u2229 RZ = n.\nThis proves \u03c1\u03b5 is the identity.\n\u0003\nWe end this section with some lemmas that will be used in the next section to prove the second\nmain theorem of the paper.\nLemma 5.5. Rti + R\u03c3id (ti ) = R for all i = 1, . . . , n and all d \u2208 Z>0 .\nProof. We have\n(5.9)\n\n\u2212dk\nrii\nti \u2212 \u03c3id (ti ) =\n\n\u2212dk k\nk\u2212dk k\n(\u2212rii\nsii + sii\n)vii\nk\nk\nrii \u2212 sii\n\nwhich is invertible since rii /sii is assumed to not be a root of 1 and since vi is invertible. This\nproves the claim.\n\u0003\nLemma 5.6. No product of elements of the form \u03c3g (ti ) (g \u2208 Zn , i = 1, . . . , n) can belong to a\nZn -invariant proper ideal of R.\nProof. Indeed, such a product can be written a = \u03be\u03c31p1 (t1 ) * * * \u03c3npn (tn ) for some nonzero \u03be \u2208 k\nand some pi \u2208 Z. But then the proper Zn -invariant ideal L containing such element would also\ncontain \u03c31 (a). By Lemma 5.5, Rt1 + R\u03c31 (t1 ) = R. So for suitable r1 , r2 \u2208 R, r1 a + r2 \u03c31 (a) =\n\u03be \u2032 \u03c32p2 (t2 ) * * * \u03c3npn (tn ) for some nonzero \u03be \u2032 \u2208 k. Continuing this way we would obtain that L contains\na nonzero scalar hence the L = R contradicting that L was proper.\n\u0003\nLemma 5.7. Assume J is a maximal Zn -invariant ideal of R. Then all ti + J (i = 1, . . . , n) are\nregular in R/J.\nProof. Let T denote the multiplicative submonoid of R/J generated by \u03c3g (ti + J) for all g \u2208 Zn\nand i = 1, . . . , n. By Lemma 5.6, 0 \u2208\n/ T . Observe that the set\nL = {r\u0304 \u2208 R/J | ur\u0304 = 0 for some u \u2208 T }\nis a Zn -invariant ideal in R/J. But L = R/J is impossible since the ring R/J is unital and\n0\u2208\n/ T . Therefore, since R/J is Zn -simple, we have L = 0 which proves that in particular all ti + J\n(i = 1, . . . , n) are regular in R/J.\n\u0003\n\n\f10\n\nVYACHESLAV FUTORNY AND JONAS T. HARTWIG\n\n5.3. Simple quotients. We come now to the main result on the structure theory of multiparameter twisted Weyl algebras. The following theorem (which is Theorem B from the Introduction)\ndescribes all quotients A/Q of A = Akn (r, s, \u039b) such that A/Q is a simple ring and such that the\nimages of Xi , Yi in A/Q are regular for all i. It also gives a necessary and sufficient condition\nunder which all such quotients are domains.\nn\nWe would like to emphasize that the subring RZ of invariants of R under Z is just a Laurent\npolynomial ring over the field k. Thus there are plenty of explicitly known maximal ideals. Moren\nover, when k is algebraically closed there is a bijection Specm(RZ ) \u2192 (k\\{0})m where m is the\nn\nnumber of variables in RZ , i.e. the rank of the subgroup G \u2286 Z2n (see (5.7)). It is in this sense\nwe view the following theorem as a parametrization of the stated family of simple quotients.\nTheorem 5.8. Let A = Akn (r, s, \u039b) be a multiparameter twisted Weyl algebra.\n(a) The assignment\n(5.10)\n\nn 7\u2192 A/hni\n\nwhere hni denotes the ideal in A generated by n, is a bijection between the set of maximal ideals\nn\nin RZ and the set of simple quotients of A in which all Xi , Yi (i = 1, . . . , n) are regular.\nn\n(b) For any n \u2208 Specm(RZ ), the quotient A/hni is isomorphic to the twisted generalized Weyl\nalgebra A\u03bc (R/Rn, \u03c3\u0304, t\u0304), where \u03c3\u0304g (r + Rn) = \u03c3g (r) + Rn \u2200g \u2208 Zn , r \u2208 R and t\u0304i = ti + Rn \u2200i.\nn\n(c) A/hni is a domain for all n \u2208 Specm(RZ ) if and only if Z2n /G is torsion-free, where G was\ndefined in (5.7).\nn\n\nProof. We first prove part (b). Let n \u2208 Specm(RZ ). Put J = Rn. Trivially AJA = hni. By\n(g )\n(g )\n(m)\n= Xim if\nLemma 5.7, ti + J are regular in R/J. For each g \u2208 Zn , Ag = RZ1 1 * * * Zn n , Zi\n(m)\nm \u2265 0 and Zi = Yi\u2212m if m < 0. We know (R, \u03c3, t) is \u03bc-consistent (see Section 5.1). Thus by\n[8, Cor. 6.4], (R/J, \u03c3\u0304, t\u0304) is also \u03bc-consistent. Thus the claim follows from [8, Thm. 4.1] using [8,\nRem. 4.2].\nn\nNow we prove part (a). Let n \u2208 Specm(RZ ). By part (b), A/hni isomorphic to \u0100 :=\nA\u03bc (R/J, \u03c3\u0304, t\u0304). By Proposition 5.4, J is maximal among Zn -invariant ideals of R, hence R/J\nis Zn -simple. By Proposition 5.2(b), R/J is maximal commutative in \u0100. Hence, in particular,\nZ(\u0100) \u2286 R/J. Let \u03c0 : R \u2192 R/J be the canonical projection. We have (R/J)t\u0304i + (R/J)\u03c3\u0304id (t\u0304i ) =\n\u03c0(Rti + R\u03c3id (ti )) + J = R/J for any i \u2208 {1, . . . , n} and d \u2208 Z>0 . Thus the requirements in Theorem 4.2(b) are fulfilled and we conclude that \u0100 is simple. For each i \u2208 {1, . . . , n}, the elements\nt\u0304i , hence also \u03c3\u0304i (t\u0304i ), are regular in R/J. By the proof of [8, Thm. 5.2(a)], these elements are also\nregular in \u0100. Since t\u0304i = Yi Xi and \u03c3\u0304i (t\u0304i ) = Xi Yi , it follows that Xi and Yi are regular in \u0100.\nConversely, assume that Q is any nonzero ideal of A such that A/Q is simple and such that\nXi + Q, Yi + Q are regular in A/Q for all i. By Proposition 5.2, R is maximal commutative in A,\nthat is CA (R) = R. So by Theorem 4.2(a), R \u2229 Q 6= 0. We claim that R \u2229 Q is Zn -invariant. Let\ni \u2208 {1, . . . , n} and p \u2208 R\u2229Q. Then Xi p \u2208 Q since Q is an ideal. On the other hand, Xi p = \u03c3i (p)Xi .\nSince the image of Xi in A/Q not a zero-divisor we conclude that \u03c3i (p) \u2208 Q. Trivially \u03c3i (p) \u2208 R.\nThus \u03c3i (R \u2229 Q) \u2286 R \u2229 Q for all i. Analogously one proves that \u03c3i\u22121 (R \u2229 Q) \u2286 R \u2229 Q (or one can\nuse that R is Noetherian). So R \u2229 Q is indeed Zn -invariant. Next we show that R \u2229 Q is maximal\namong Zn -invariant ideals in R. Suppose R \u2229 Q ( J \u2286 R where J is a Zn -invariant ideal of R.\nSince J is Zn -invariant, AJ is a two-sided ideal of A. Any element of AJ + Q of degree zero has the\nform p + a where p \u2208 J and a is the degree zero component of an element of Q. But Q is graded\nby Proposition 5.3 so a \u2208 Q. Thus (AJ + Q) \u2229 R = J + (Q \u2229 R) = J. Thus AJ + Q is an ideal of A\nwhich properly contains Q. Since Q was maximal, AJ + Q = A and thus J = (AJ + Q) \u2229 R = R.\nThis shows that R \u2229 Q is maximal among all Zn -invarant ideals of R. By Proposition 5.4, we\nn\nconclude that R \u2229 Q equals Rn for some maximal ideal n of RZ . So for this n we have hni \u2286 Q.\nBut we proved above that A/hni is always simple. Thus hni is a maximal ideal of A which implies\nthat hni = Q.\nn\nFinally, two different ideals n, n\u2032 in RZ cannot generate the same maximal ideal L in A, since\nthen 1 \u2208 n + n\u2032 \u2286 L which is absurd.\n\n\fMULTIPARAMETER TWISTED WEYL ALGEBRAS\n\n11\n\n(c) By Proposition 2.9 and part (b) we have that A/hni is a domain iff Rn is a prime ideal of\nn\nR. Assume Rn is prime for all n \u2208 Specm(RZ ). Suppose d \u2208 Z2n , d \u2208\n/ G but that there is a\np \u2208 Z>0 such that pd \u2208 G. Without loss of generality we can assume p is prime. Then there is a\nj \u2208 {1, . . . , n} such that \u03c3j (ud ) = \u03b6ud where \u03b6 \u2208 k, \u03b6 6= 1, \u03b6 p = 1. Pick any Z-basis {d1 , . . . , dN } for\nn\nG and take n to be the maximal ideal in RZ generated by udi \u22121 for i = 1, . . . , N . Then upd \u22121 \u2208 n\nalso, because pd is a Z-linear combination of the di . But upd \u2212 1 = (ud \u2212 1)(ud \u2212 \u03b6) * * * (ud \u2212 \u03b6 p\u22121 ).\nSince Rn is prime we conclude that ud \u2212 \u03b6 e \u2208 Rn for some e \u2208 {0, . . . , p \u2212 1}. However Rn is\nZn -invariant and thus Rn \u220b ud \u2212 \u03b6 e \u2212 \u03b6 \u22121 \u03c3j (ud \u2212 \u03b6 e ) = (\u03b6 \u22121 \u2212 1)\u03b6 e which is invertible. This\ncontradicts that Rn is a proper ideal of R which we know by Proposition 5.4. Hence Z2n /G is\ntorsion-free.\nConversely, assume that Z2n /G is torsion-free. Thus Z2n \u2243 G \u2295 G\u2032 for some subgroup G\u2032 of\n2n\nZ . Therefore, viewing R as the group algebra k[Z2n ], we have an isomorphism R = k[Z2n ] \u2243\nn\nk[G] \u2297k k[G\u2032 ]. Under this isomorphism, Rn (where n \u2208 Specm(RZ ) is arbitrary) is mapped to\nn \u2297 k[G\u2032 ] which is a prime ideal in k[G] \u2297k k[G\u2032 ] since\nn\nk[G] \u2297k k[G\u2032 ]\n\u2243 (RZ /n)[G\u2032 ],\n\u2032\nn \u2297 k[G ]\n\nwhich is a Laurent polynomial algebra over a field. This proves that Rn is a prime ideal of R for\nn\nany n \u2208 Specm(RZ ).\n\u0003\n6.

Assume now that we are in the generic\ncase as in subsection 6.3. As it was observed in [4], the multiparameter Weyl algebra Ar,s (n) can\nbe realized as a degree n generalized Weyl algebra. For this construction, let Di be the subalgebra\n\u00b11\nof Ar,s (n) generated by the elements \u03c1i , \u03c1i\u22121 , \u03c3i , \u03c3i\u22121 .

Therefore, there is a surjection Wn := D(\u03c6, t) \u2192 Ar,s (n). But since Ar,s (n) has a presentation\nby (R1)-(R5), there is a surjection Ar,s (n) \u2192 Wn .

Bavula [3, Prop. 7] has shown that a generalized Weyl algebra\nD(\u03c6, t) is left and right Noetherian if D is Noetherian, and it is a domain if D is a domain. Since\nD is commutative and finitely generated, it is Noetherian, hence so are Wn and Ar,s (n).

Let P = k[s1 , . . . , sn ] be the polynomial algebra in n variables and\n\u03c4i the k-algebra automorphisms of P defined by\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\nj < i,\n\uf8f2 sj ,\nP\n(7.6)\n\u03c4i (sj ) = 1 + qi si + i\u22121\n(q\n\u2212\n1)s\n,\nj = i,\nk\nk=1 k\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\nqi sj ,\nj > i.\nOne can check that the \u03c4i commute. Let \u03bc = (\u03bcij )ni,j=1 be defined by\n(\n\u03bbji ,\ni < j,\n(7.7)\n\u03bcij =\nqj \u03bbji , i > j.\n\nPut \u03c4 = (\u03c41 , . . . , \u03c4n ) and s = (s1 , . . . , sn ). Let A\u03bc (P, \u03c4, s) be the associated twisted generalized\nWeyl algebra. From (7.6) it is easy to see that A\u03bc (P, \u03c4, s) is k-finitistic, and that the minimal\npolynomials are pij (x) = x \u2212 1 for i < j and pij (x) = x \u2212 qi for j > i, so the algebra is of type\n(A1 )n . By Theorem 4.1, one checks that A\u03bc (P, \u03c4, s) is isomorphic to Aq\u0304,\u039b\nn (k) via Xi 7\u2192 xi , Yi 7\u2192 yi\nand si 7\u2192 yi xi . The representation theory of Aq\u0304,\u039b\nhas\nbeen\nstudied\nfrom\nthe point of view of TGW\nn\nalgebras in [18] and [9].\nIn the following it will be convenient to identify P with its isomorphic image in Aq\u0304,\u039b\nvia\nn\n:\nsi 7\u2192 yi xi . Consider the following elements in Aq\u0304,\u039b\nn\nX\n(7.8)\nzi = 1 +\n(qk \u2212 1)sk ,\ni = 1, . . . , n.\nk\u2264i\n\nIt was shown in [14] that the the set Z := {z1k1 * * * znkn | k1 , . . . , kn \u2208 Z} is an Ore set in Aq\u0304,\u039b\nand\nn\nthat, provided that none of the qi is a root of unity, the localized algebra\nBnq\u0304,\u039b := Z \u22121 Aq\u0304,\u039b\nn\nis simple.\nThe algebra Bnq\u0304,\u039b can also be realized as a twisted generalized Weyl algebra. To see this,\nconsider the following subset of P :\n(7.9)\n\nS = {\u03b1z1k1 * * * znkn | \u03b1 \u2208 k\\{0}, ki \u2208 Z}.\n\nwhere zi were defined in (7.8). Then 0 \u2208\n/ S, 1 \u2208 S, a, b \u2208 S \u21d2 ab \u2208 S, the elements of S are\nregular, and moreover S has the virtue of being Zn -invariant, using the relation\n(\nzj ,\nj < i,\n(7.10)\n\u03c4i (zj ) =\nqi zj , j \u2265 i,\nwhich can be proved using (7.8) and (7.6). Thus [8, Thm. 5.2] can be applied to give, together\nwith the isomorphism Aq\u0304,\u039b\nn \u2243 A\u03bc (P, \u03c4, s), that\n\u22121\nS \u22121 Aq\u0304,\u039b\nA\u03bc (P, \u03c4, s) \u2243 A\u03bc (S \u22121 P , \u03c4e, s).\nn \u2243 S\n\nBut localizing at S is equivalent to localizing at Z, and thus\nBnq\u0304,\u039b \u2243 A\u03bc (S \u22121 P , \u03c4e, s).\n\n7.2. Relation to multiparameter twisted Weyl algebras. We show here how the algebra\nBnq\u0304,\u039b fits into the framework of multiparameter twisted Weyl algebras. We keep all notation from\nprevious section. Let q\u0304 = (q1 , . . . , qn ) \u2208 (k\\{0})n and let \u039b = (\u03bbij )ni,j=1 be an n \u00d7 n matrix with\n\u03bbij \u2208 k\\{0}, \u03bbii = 1, \u03bbij \u03bbji = 1 for all i, j.

Recall that, by definition, this means that Akn (r, s, \u039b) is the twisted generalized\nWeyl algebra A\u03bc (R, \u03c3, t) where\n\u00b11 \u00b11\n\u00b11\nR = k[u\u00b11\n1 , . . . , un , v1 , . . . , vn ],\n\n(7.12)\n\n\u22121\n\u03c3i (uj ) = rij\nuj ,\n\n(7.13)\n(7.14)\n\nti =\n\n\u03c3i (vj ) = s\u22121\nij vj ,\n\nui \u2212 qi\u22121 vi\n,\n1 \u2212 qi\u22121\n\n\u2212k\n\u03bcij = rji\n\u03bbji ,\n\n(7.15)\n\nfor all i, j \u2208 {1, . . . , n}.

We claim that \u03c8 is Zn -equivariant. Indeed,\n\u22121\n\u22121 \u22121\n\u03c8(\u03c3i (uj )) = \u03c8(rij\nuj ) = \u2212rij\nqi zi\u22121 ,\n\nwhile, using (7.10) and (7.11) in the last step,\n\u22121 \u22121\n\u03c4ei (\u03c8(uj )) = \u03c4ei (\u2212qj\u22121 zj\u22121 ) = \u2212rij\nqi zi\u22121 .\n\nSimilarly \u03c8(\u03c3i (vj )) = \u03c4ei (\u03c8(vj )). This proves that \u03c8\u03c3i = \u03c4ei \u03c8 for each i, so in other words, that \u03c8\nis Zn -equivariant. Also, for any i \u2208 {1, . . . , n},\n\u03c8(ti ) = \u03c8\n\nui \u2212 qi\u22121 vi \u0001 \u2212qi\u22121 zi\u22121 + qi\u22121 zi\nzi \u2212 zi\u22121\n= si\n=\n=\nqi \u2212 1\n1 \u2212 qi\u22121\n1 \u2212 qi\u22121\n\nby (7.8). We have proved that \u03c8 is a morphism in the category TGWn (k) between (R, \u03c3, t) and\n(S \u22121 P, \u03c4e, s). It is easy to see that \u03c8 is surjective because the image contains both s1 , . . . , sn since\n\u03c8(ti ) = si , and the inverses of the zi : zi\u22121 = \u03c8(\u2212vi\u22121 ). Applying the functor A to \u03c8 gives a\nsurjective k-algebra morphism A\u03bc (\u03c8) : A\u03bc (R, \u03c3, t) \u2192 A\u03bc (S \u22121 P , \u03c4, s).\n\n\fMULTIPARAMETER TWISTED WEYL ALGEBRAS\n\n15\n\nn\n\n7.2.2.

We have \u03c8(wi ) = qi\u22121 for i = 1, . . . , n which shows that J = Rn \u2286 ker \u03c8.\nThus \u03c8 induces a map \u03a8 : R/J \u2192 S \u22121 P , also Zn -equivariant and \u03a8(t\u0304i ) = si . Since \u03c8 is\nsurjective, so is \u03a8. Applying the functor from [8, Thm. 3.1] we get a surjective homomorphism\nA(\u03a8) : A\u03bc (R/J, \u03c3, t) \u2192 A\u03bc (S \u22121 P , \u03c4e, s).

Simple weight modules\nIn this section we describe the simple weight modules over the simple algebras A = Akn (r, s, \u039b)/hJi\nfrom Theorem 5.8. We also assume that the ground field k is algebraically closed. We will use\nnotation from Section 5.1.\n8.1. Dynamics of orbits and their breaks. The group Zn acts on R via the automorphisms\n\u03c3i . Explicitly, g(r) = (\u03c31g1 * * * \u03c3ngn )(r) for g = (g1 , . . . , gn ) \u2208 Zn and r \u2208 R. Using this action and\n(2.1a) we have a * r = (deg a)(r) * a for any homogenous a \u2208 A and any r \u2208 R. The group Zn\nalso acts on Max(R), the set of maximal ideals of R. Let \u03a9 denote the set of orbits of this action.\nAn element m \u2208 Max(R) is called an i-break if ti \u2208 m. An orbit O \u2208 \u03a9 is called degenerate if it\ncontains an i-break for some i. A break m in an orbit O is called maximal if m is an i-break for\nall i for which O contains an i-break.\nProposition 8.1. Let m \u2208 Specm(R). Then the stabilizer Stab(m) is trivial.\nProof.

Abstract description of the simple weight modules in case of trivial stabilizer.\nLet A = A\u03bc (R, \u03c3, t) be a TGWA where \u03bc is symmetric. In [16] a description of all simple weight\nmodules with support in an orbit with trivial stabilizer is given in terms of a Shapovalov type\nform. The form used in [16] requires the matrix \u03bc to be symmetric (due to its formulation in\nterms of a certain involution on the TGWA). As is observed in [11], there is another way to define\na bilinear form which works for general \u03bc. It is given as follows. Let p0 : A \u2192 A0 = R be the\ngraded projection onto the degree zero component of A with respect to the standard Zn -gradation\non A.

The first case is that G\nm = Z. Then we say that\ne (i)\n(the support of) V is generic in the i:th direction. The second case is j \u2208\n/G\nm for some positive\ninteger j. Assuming j is the smallest such integer, by (8.10) and (8.11) we get \u03c3i\u2212j+1 (ti ) \u2208 m. By\n\n\f18\n\nVYACHESLAV FUTORNY AND JONAS T.

Thus G\nBy Theorem 8.7, Supp(V ) = {\u03c3g (m) | g \u2208 Gm } and thus we can replace m by \u03c3ik\u22121 (m). Doing\n(i)\nthis, the new j just equals 1 and Gm = Z\u22640 . We say that m is a highest weight for V in the i:th\ne(i)\ndirection. The final case is that j \u2208\n/ G\nm for some negative integer j. This is analogous to the\n(i)\nem\n= Z\u22650 in which case we say that\nprevious case and leads to that, without loss of generality, G\nm is a lowest weight for V in the i:th direction.\nIn other words, there is an m \u2208 Supp(V ) such that the shape of the support of V is characterized\nby a vector\n\n\u03c4 \u2208 {\u22121, 0, 1}n\n\n(8.13)\nvia the relation\n\ne(i)\nG\nm = {j \u2208 Z | j * \u03c4i \u2265 0}\n\n(8.14)\n\n\u2200i \u2208 {1, . . . , n}.\n\nSince the stabilizer of m is trivial by Proposition 8.1, the subalgebra B(m) in Theorem 8.7 is\njust R. From well known results [7] (see [16, Proposition 7.2] for a proof in the TGW algebra\ncase), it follows that Vm is simple as a B(m)-module since V is simple as an A-module. Thus,\nsince R/m = k, we have dimk Vm = 1. Pick v0 \u2208 Vm , v0 6= 0. Then Theorem 8.7 implies that the\nset\n(g1 )\n\n(8.15)\n\nC = {vg := Z1\n(j)\n\nem }\n* * * Zn(gn ) v0 | g = (g1 , . . . , gn ) \u2208 G\n\nis a k-basis for V , where Zi = Xij if j \u2265 0 and Yi\u2212j otherwise.

Whittaker modules\n\nDefinition 9.1. Let A be a twisted generalized Weyl algebra of degree n. A module V over A is\ncalled a Whittaker module if there exists a vector v0 \u2208 V (called Whittaker vector) and nonzero\nscalars \u03b61 , . . . , \u03b6n \u2208 k\\{0} such that the following conditions hold:\n\u2022 V = Av0 ,\n\u2022 Xi v0 = \u03b6i v0 for each i = 1, . . . , n.\nThe pair (V, v0 ) is called a Whittaker pair of type (\u03b61 , . . . , \u03b6n ). A morphism of Whittaker pairs\n(V, v0 ) \u2192 (W, w0 ) is an A-module morphism V \u2192 W mapping v0 to w0 .\nThe following theorem describes Whittaker pairs over a family of TGWAs which properly\nincludes all generalized Weyl algebras in which the ti are regular. It is a generalization of [5,\nTheorem 3.12]. We use the notation from Section 4.1.\n\n\fMULTIPARAMETER TWISTED WEYL ALGEBRAS\n\n19\n\nTheorem 9.2. Let A = A\u03bc (R, \u03c3, t) be a k-finitistic TGW algebra of Lie type (A1 )n .

Then for i 6= j,\nXi Xj v0 = \u03b6i \u03b6j v0 . On the other hand, by relation (4.5), Xi Xj = \u03b3ij \u03bc\u22121\nij Xj Xi and thus Xi Xj v0 =\n\u22121\n\u03b3ij \u03bcij\nXj Xi v0 = \u03b3ij \u03bc\u22121\n\u03b6\n\u03b6\nv\n.\nThus,\nsince\nv\nand\nall\n\u03b6\nare\nnonzero\nby definition, we conclude\n0\ni\nij i j 0\nthat (9.1) must hold.\nb) Suppose (V, v0 ) is a Whittaker pair with respect to \u03b6 \u2208 (k\\{0})n . Let Q = AnnR v0 . Clearly\nQ is a proper left ideal of R. For any r \u2208 Q we have 0 = Xi rv0 = \u03c3i (r)Xi v0 = \u03b6i \u03c3i (r)v0 which\nshows that \u03c3i (Q) \u2286 Q for any i \u2208 {1, . . . , n}. Since R is Noetherian, \u03c3i\u22121 (Q) \u2286 Q as well, which\nproves that Q is Zn -invariant. In addition, if (V, v0 ) and (W, w0 ) are two isomorphic Whittaker\npairs, then clearly AnnR v0 = AnnR w0 . This shows that the map \u03a8 is well-defined.\nTo prove that \u03a8 is surjective, suppose that Q is a proper Zn -invariant left ideal of R. We show\nthat (9.2) extends the natural R-module structure on R/Q to an A-module structure. We only\nprove that the following relations are preserved: Xi Yj = \u03bcij Yj Xi (i 6= j) and Yj Yi = \u03b3ij \u03bc\u22121\nji Yi Yj\n(i 6= j). The other cases are identical to the generalized Weyl algebra case considered in [5, Section\n3]. We have\nXi Yj .r\u0304 = Xi .\u03b6j\u22121 \u03c3j\u22121 (r)tj = \u03b6i \u03b6j\u22121 \u03c3i \u03c3j\u22121 (r)\u03c3i (tj ).\nUsing that \u03c3i (tj ) = \u03b3ij tj (see (4.2)) and condition (9.1) we see that Xi Yj .r\u0304 = \u03bcij Yj Xi .r\u0304 for any\n\u22121\nr\u0304 \u2208 R/Q. Similarly Yj Yi .r\u0304 = \u03b6i\u22121 \u03b6j\u22121 \u03c3i\u22121 \u03c3j\u22121 (r)\u03c3j\u22121 (ti )tj so using \u03c3j\u22121 (ti )tj = \u03b3ji\n\u03b3ij ti \u03c3i\u22121 (tj ) and\n\u22121\n(9.1) again, we see that Yj Yi .r\u0304 = \u03b3ij \u03bcji Yi Yj .r\u0304, \u2200i 6= j. Thus R/Q becomes an A-module which is\na Whittaker module of type \u03b6 with Whittaker vector 1 + Q.\nTo prove that \u03a8 is injective we may, as in [5], construct a universal Whittaker module Vu of\ntype \u03b6 by putting Vu = A\u2297A+ k\u03b6 where A+ is the subalgebra of A generated over k by X1 , . . . , Xn ,\nand k\u03b6 is the 1-dimensional module over A+ given by Xi .1 := \u03b6i . The map \u03b9 : R \u2192 Vu , r 7\u2192 r \u2297 1 is\nan R-module isomorphism. Then there is a unique morphism of Whittaker pairs from (Vu , 1 \u2297 1)\nto any other Whittaker pair (V, v0 ) of type \u03b6. And, identifying Vu with R via \u03b9, the kernel of\nthe map Vu \u2192 V , is precisely AnnR v0 . So if (V, v0 ) and (W, w0 ) are two Whittaker pairs with\nAnnR v0 = AnnR w0 , it means that they are isomorphic to the same quotient of the universal\nWhittaker pair of type \u03b6, hence are isomorphic to eachother.\nc) If \u03c6 : (V, v0 ) \u2192 (W, w0 ) is a morphism of Whittaker pairs, then \u03c6(rv0 ) = r\u03c6(v0 ) = rw0 so\nclearly AnnR v0 \u2286 AnnR w0 . Conversely, if Q1 \u2286 Q2 are proper Zn -invariant left ideals, then there\nis an R-module morphism \u03c0 : R/Q1 \u2192 R/Q2 mapping 1 + Q1 to 1 + Q2 . Since \u03c0 commutes with\nthe Zn -action, one verifies that \u03c0 is automatically an A-module morphism.\n\u0003\n\n\f20\n\nVYACHESLAV FUTORNY AND JONAS T. HARTWIG\n\nCorollary 9.3.
