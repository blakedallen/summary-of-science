Introduction\nCosmological inflation is our leading theory of the very early universe [1, 2, 3, 4], although its\nunderlying microphysics is still unknown. Slow-roll inflation occurs in many models constructed\nover the years, with a scattering of model-dependent predictions. Models of inflation are quite UV\nsensitive since it may have occurred at extremely high energy scales, far higher than that which\nwe can probe at colliders, and since some models involve super-Planckian excursions in field space.\nThis suggests that top-down approaches may be required to make progress, although progress in\nthat direction has not been easy (e.g., see [5]). On the other hand, it is interesting to explore simple\nmodels to see what we might learn and if we can connect inflation to low energy physics.\nOne approach is to focus on dimension 4 Lagrangians, which allows the inclusion of the operators (\u2202\u03c6)2 , \u03bb\u03c64 , and \u03be\u03c62 R in addition to the Einstein Hilbert term m2Pl R (by \"dimension 4\"\nwe mean that each operator has a dimensionless coefficient, although gravity modifies the power\ncounting since every term is an infinite tower of operators if we expand around flat space). The\n\u03be\u03c62 R term is in fact required to exist for an interacting scalar field in curved space (although not\nfor a Goldstone boson, for example). By taking the non-minimal coupling \u03be to be large, a phase of\ninflation takes place, as originally discussed in [6] with constraints discussed in [7, 8, 9, 10].\nA large dimensionless coupling is unusual from the perspective of particle physics, leading to\nmuch recent debate as to whether such models make sense quantum mechanically [6, 11, 12, 13, 14,\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\f15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28]. In this work we show that for a single scalar\nfield \u03c6 the model is well behaved quantum mechanically in the pure gravity and kinetic sectors,\nsince these do not generate large quantum corrections. However, the self-interacting potential does\n~ carrying an O(N ) symmetry the theory\nlikely cause the theory to fail. For a vector of fields \u03c6\nmanifestly generates large quantum corrections in the gravity and kinetic sectors and breaks down\nat high scales relevant to inflation. As far as we aware, this difference between the single field\nand multi-field case has not been fully appreciated in the literature. So multi-field models of nonminimal inflation are manifestly ruled out (including the Standard Model Higgs), while single field\nmodels of non-minimal inflation are also problematic, in the sense that the Einstein frame potential\nis non-polynomial and therefore these models likely fail due to high energy scattering processes.\nThis presents a challenge to them having a UV completion. We also examine curvature-squared\nmodels and show that their scalar-tensor formulation is perturbatively well behaved in the gravity,\nkinetic, and potential sectors; this contradicts the claims of Ref. [17].\nOur paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we briefly review the class of non-minimal\nmodels, in Section 3 we discuss the quantum corrections, in Section 4 we discuss the pion analogy,\nin Section 5 we discuss curvature-squared models, and finally we conclude in Section 6.\n\n2. Non-minimally Coupled Models\n~ with an O(N ) symmetry, non-minimally coupled to gravity. It\nConsider a vector of scalar fields \u03c6\n~ * \u2202 \u03c6,\n~ \u03bb(\u03c6\n~ * \u03c6)\n~ 2 , and \u03be \u03c6\n~ * \u03c6R,\n~\nis permissible to introduce the following terms into the action: \u2202 \u03c6\nwhere the last term represents a non-minimal coupling of the field to gravity. At the classical level\nwe can choose to simply study only these terms, although all terms consistent with symmetries\nwill be generated in the quantum theory; an issue we will turn to in the next Section on quantum\ncorrections. For now, adding these 3 terms to the usual Einstein-Hilbert term, we have the action\nZ\nS=\n\n\u221a\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n1 2 ~\n1 ~ ~\n~\nd x \u2212g mPl f (\u03c6)R \u2212 \u2202 \u03c6 * \u2202 \u03c6 \u2212 V (\u03c6) ,\n2\n2\n4\n\n(2.1)\n\n~ = 1 + \u03be\u03c6\n~ * \u03c6/m\n~ 2 and V (\u03c6)\n~ = \u03bb (\u03c6\n~ * \u03c6)\n~ 2 . Since we have a new parameter \u03be, which\nwhere f (\u03c6)\nPl\n4\nis essentially unconstrained by observation, this allows the self-coupling parameter to be nonnegligible, such as \u03bb = O(10\u22121 ), and yet we can achieve the correct amplitude of density fluctuations\nby making \u03be very large: \u03be = O(104 ). This was the original motivation of Ref. [6] for introducing\nsuch models, since it appeared that embedding the inflaton into the matter sector of the theory\nwould be easier. By contrast compare to minimal \u03bb\u03c64 inflation, with \u03bb = O(10\u221212 ), which is\nevidently radiatively unstable if \u03c6 carries appreciable couplings to other fields.\nOne may either study the theory in this original Jordan frame, or switch to the Einstein frame\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\fE = f (\u03c6)g\n~ \u03bc\u03bd .

Assuming only\none component is active, call it \u03c6, the kinetic energy sector can be made canonical (this will change\nin the quantum analysis, where all components will be important). Let us make this explicit. We\nintroduce a new field \u03c3, defined through the integral\nZ \u03c6 s\n1\n6 \u03be 2 \u03c6\u03042\n+ 2\n.\n(2.4)\n\u03c3 \u2261 sign(\u03c6)\nd\u03c6\u0304\nf (\u03c6\u0304) mPl f (\u03c6\u0304)2\n0\nIn terms of \u03c3 both the gravity and kinetic sectors are minimal, but the potential VE (\u03c3) is somewhat\ncomplicated, but monotonic and well behaved.\n\u221a\nIt is simple to see from eq. (2.2) that when \u03c6 \u001d mPl / \u03be (corresponding to \u03c3 \u001d mPl ) the\npotential VE approaches a constant; this is the regime in which the effective Planck mass runs in\nthe original Jordan frame. In this regime the flatness of the potential ensures that a phase of slow\u221a\nroll inflation takes place. Inflation ends when \u03c6 \u223c \u03c6e \u2261 mPl / \u03be. For details on the inflationary\npredictions we point the reader to Refs. [6, 11].\n\n3. Quantum Corrections\nVarious attempts have been made at addressing whether quantum corrections spoil the validity\nof these non-minimal models of inflation due to the \u03be\u03c62 R term; see [6, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,\n18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28]. In each of these works, the conclusion (either positive\nor negative) came independent of the number of scalars \u03c6i . Here we will show that the answer\nis in fact two-fold: for single field models the gravity and kinetic sectors do not generate large\nquantum corrections, instead it is the potential V (\u03c6) that causes the theory to enter a regime in\nwhich standard perturbation theory likely breaks down. For multiple field models, we show that\nthe theory manifestly generates large quantum corrections in the gravity and kinetic sectors and\nbreaks down in the regime relevant for inflation.\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n\fFigure 1: Tree-level scattering 2\u03c6 \u2192 2\u03c6. Diagrams 1\u20133: In Jordan frame it is due to graviton exchange\nthrough t, u, and s-channels. Diagram 4: In Einstein frame it is due to a single 4-point vertex.\n\n3.1 Single Field\nMost descriptions of non-minimal models have focussed on just a single field \u03c6, even for cases where\n\u03c6 represents the Higgs. For example, in [18] it is explicitly assumed that all quantum issues require\nonly a single field analysis (and it is concluded in [18] that the quantum field theory is highly\nunnatural and breaks down). In this case it is subtle as to whether the effective field theory makes\nsense. Let us go through the analysis first in the Jordan frame and then the Einstein frame. We\nbegin by examining the gravity and kinetic sectors (as was the focus of Ref. [17]) before addressing\nthe potential V in the next section.\nIn the Jordan frame we must examine the consequences of the \u03be\u03c62 R operator. Let us expand\naround flat space. We decompose the metric as\ng\u03bc\u03bd = \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd +\n\nh\u03bc\u03bd\n,\nmPl\n\n(3.1)\n\nhere h\u03bc\u03bd are metric perturbations with mass dimension 1. The Ricci scalar has an expansion\naround flat space that goes as R \u223c \u0003h/mPl + . . .. To leading order in the Planck mass, this gives\nthe following dimension 5 operator in the Jordan frame action\n\u03be 2\n\u03c6 \u0003h.\nmPl\n\n(3.2)\n\nIt is tempting to declare that this implies the theory has a cutoff at \u039b = mPl /\u03be, but is this correct?\nTo answer this, let us consider the scattering process: 2\u03c6 \u2192 2\u03c6. At tree-level this proceeds via a\nsingle exchange of a graviton, giving the following leading order contribution to the matrix element\n(we assume massless \u03c6 particles)\n\u03be2E2\n.\n(3.3)\nMc (2\u03c6 \u2192 2\u03c6) \u223c\nm2Pl\nThis appears to confirm that the cutoff is indeed \u039b = mPl /\u03be, but this conclusion is premature. Let\nus explain why. The index c on M stands for \"channel\"; there are s, t, and u-channels, which all\nscale similarly (Fig. 1 diagrams 1\u20133). When we sum over all 3 channels to get Mtot and put the\nexternal particles on-shell, an amusing thing happens: they cancel. So the leading term in powers\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n\fof \u03be vanishes [29, 30]. The first non-zero piece is\nMtot (2\u03c6 \u2192 2\u03c6) \u223c\n\nE2\n,\nm2Pl\n\n(3.4)\n\nwhich shows that the true cutoff in the pure gravity and kinetic sectors is \u039b = mPl (although the\ninclusion of the potential V will greatly change this, as we explain shortly). Hence, according to\n2 \u2192 2 tree-level scattering the theory only fails at Planckian energies.\nWhat about in the Einstein frame? To address this question we need to focus on the kinetic\nsector, which we presented earlier in eq. (2.3). By expanding for small \u03c6, we have the following\ncontributions\n6 \u03be2\n(\u2202\u03c6)2 + 2 \u03c62 (\u2202\u03c6)2 + . . .\n(3.5)\nmPl\nThe second term appears to represent a dimension 6 interaction term with cutoff \u039b = mPl /\u03be. We\ncan compute 2\u03c6 \u2192 2\u03c6 scattering at tree-level using this single 4-point vertex (Fig. 1 diagram 4).\nWe find the scaling M \u223c \u03be 2 E 2 /m2Pl , but when the external particles are put on-shell we find that\nthe result is zero. This is also true at arbitrary loop order (see Fig. 2 for the 1-loop diagrams) and\nfor any scattering process (despite the power counting estimates of Ref. [17]). The reason for this\nwas alluded to earlier: in this single field case, we can perform a field redefinition to \u03c3 (eq. (2.4))\nwhich carries canonical kinetic energy. Hence the kinetic sector is that of a free theory, modulo its\nminimal coupling to gravity, giving the correct cutoff \u039b = mPl . This field redefinition can always\nbe done for a single field. Once the field redefinition is performed we see that the only effective\ninteractions that will be generated, in the absence of including contributions from the potential V ,\nare Planck suppressed. Hence scattering amplitudes generated from purely the gravity and kinetic\nsectors allow the theory to be well defined up to Planckian energies. This shows that naive power\ncounting can be misleading. However, the potential V causes the cutoff to be greatly reduced, as\nwe now explain.\n3.2 The Potential\nNext we examine the potential V . This potential seems particularly strange in the Einstein frame,\nwhere it takes the following form\nVE (\u03c3) = \u0010\n\n\u03bb\n4\n4 \u03c6(\u03c3)\n\n1+\n\n\u0011 =\n2 2\n\n\u03be\u03c6(\u03c3)\nm2Pl\n\n\u03bb 4 \u03bb \u03be2 6\n\u03c3 \u2212 2 \u03c3 + ...\n4\nmPl\n\n(3.6)\n\nIn this case it would seem that the theory breaks down for \u039b \u223c mPl /\u03be. It is important to compute\nthe quantum corrections. Recall the general form for the one-loop quantum corrected potential [31]\nV1 loop (\u03c3) = Vcl (\u03c3) +\n\n\u00012\n\u0001\n1\nVcl00 (\u03c3) ln Vcl00 (\u03c3) + . . . .\n2\n64\u03c0\n\n(3.7)\n\nSince the full potential is slowly varying it is simple to check that the corrections are always small,\nespecially for small \u03bb. Since the one-loop quantum corrections are small, there is some naive hope\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n\fFigure 2: One-loop scattering 2\u03c6 \u2192 2\u03c6. Diagrams 1\u20139 (left block): In Jordan frame it is due to graviton\nexchange. Diagrams 10\u201312 (right block): In Einstein frame it is due to a 4-point vertex. Top row: t-channel,\nmiddle row: u-channel, bottom row: s-channel.\n\nthat this theory may make sense; this appears to be the philosophy advocated in recent studies of\nHiggs-inflation. On the other hand, one might take the point of view that by simply expanding\naround small \u03c3, the theory fails when the higher order terms are comparable to the lower order\nterms. The breakdown of this theory would appear in many-particle hard scattering processes, such\nas 3 \u2192 3.\nThe behavior of a scalar field theory with a slowly varying non-polynomial potential is considered an open problem in field theory. However, a perturbative analysis suggests that the theory\nfails at \u039b \u223c mPl /\u03be. For instance, if we consider tree-level scattering of 2 \u2192 2 + n particles, then its\ncross-section should scale as \u223c (\u03bb2 /E 2 )(E n \u03be n /mnPl ), which indicates that the perturbative description breaks down for E & \u03bb\u22122/n mPl /\u03be \u2192 mPl /\u03be for large n. Note that this conclusion arises only\nif one studies scattering amplitudes involving vertices provided by the potential V . In particular,\nthis necessarily requires scattering amplitudes to involve powers of \u03bb. Such factors of \u03bb were not\nincluded in eq. (3.15) of Ref. [17], who focussed exclusively on the gravity and kinetic sectors.\nHence, the scattering estimates provided in eq. (3.15) of Ref. [17] do not apply in the case of a\nsinglet scalar, since they arise exclusively from the gravity and kinetic sectors alone (as we analyzed\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n\fin the previous section). However, by including corrections from the potential, the theory likely\nfails at \u223c mPl /\u03be.\nTo say it differently, the Einstein frame Lagrangian acquires a shift symmetry \u03c3 \u2192 \u03c3 + \u03c30 in\nthe \u03bb \u2192 0 limit, which protects scattering amplitudes from becoming large. This also occurs in the\nJordan frame, though the symmetry is nonlinearly realized. However, finite \u03bb breaks the symmetry\nand likely compromises the theory.\n3.3 Multiple Fields\nIn the case of N -fields, the story is rather different. Here we can just focus on the gravity and\nkinetic sectors to understand that the effective theory breaks down. Let us begin the discussion\nagain in the Jordan frame. Expanding the metric around flat space as before, we have the set of\ndimension 5 interactions\n\u03be ~ ~\n\u03c6 * \u03c6 \u0003h\n(3.8)\nmPl\nConsider particles \u03c61 and \u03c62 . Lets compute the tree-level scattering process \u03c61 + \u03c62 \u2192 \u03c61 + \u03c62 due\nto the exchange of one graviton. The scattering matrix scales as earlier\nMc (\u03c61 + \u03c62 \u2192 \u03c61 + \u03c62 ) \u223c\n\n\u03be2E2\n.\nm2Pl\n\n(3.9)\n\nBut unlike the case of identical particles, this process only occurs through a single channel \u2013 the tchannel (Fig. 1 diagram 1). Hence there is no cancellation. This means that the theory does become\nstrongly coupled at \u039b = mPl /\u03be. Furthermore, the probability for a pair of different particles to\nscatter off each other grows without bound, violating unitarity (as noted in Refs. [17, 32]).\n~\nIn the Einstein frame the kinetic sector takes the following form for small \u03c6\n~ * \u2202\u03c6\n~+\n\u2202\u03c6\n\n6 \u03be2 ~ ~ 2\n(\u03c6 * \u2202 \u03c6) + . . .\nm2Pl\n\n(3.10)\n\nIt is impossible to perform a field re-definition to bring this into canonical form. The second term\nintroduces cross terms between the different fields: \u03be 2 \u03c61 \u2202\u03c61 \u03c62 \u2202\u03c62 /m2Pl . As in the Jordan frame,\nthis allows for \u03c61 + \u03c62 \u2192 \u03c61 + \u03c62 scattering to take place at tree-level through a simplified vertex\nwith M \u223c \u03be 2 E 2 /m2Pl . This confirms that the theory is strongly interacting at \u039b = mPl /\u03be.\nBut what if we focus purely on the scattering of identical particles 2\u03c61 \u2192 2\u03c61 ? Then at treelevel we seem fine, due to the cancellation among the 3 channels. However, the strong coupling\nbetween \u03c61 and \u03c62 ensures that quantum corrections from \u03c62 particles running in the loop are large\nand do not cancel among channels. In Fig. 2 we have included all 1PI one-loop diagrams in the\nJordan frame (9 diagrams in the left block) and Einstein frame (3 diagrams in the right block). If\nonly a single field \u03c61 is present then cancellation occurs from summing the 9 diagrams in Jordan\nframe, or summing the 3 diagrams in Einstein frame. When \u03c62 is included it only appears in the\nloop in the 3rd column of diagrams in the Jordan frame, and in all 3 diagrams in the Einstein frame\nbut with a truncated vertex rule. This prevents cancellation among the diagrams.\n\n\u20137\u2013\n\n\fNote that the breakdown of the theory at \u039b = mPl /\u03be is due to scalar fields running in a loop,\nnot gravitons. Hence this represents a breakdown of the matter sector, not a quantum-gravity effect\nper se. In order to eliminate the ensuing divergences, we require the introduction of new operators\ninto the classical Lagrangian:\nc1 ~ ~ 2\n(\u2202 \u03c6 * \u2202 \u03c6) ,\n\u039b4\n\nc2\n~ * \u2202\u03bd \u03c6)(\u2202\n~ \u03bc\u03c6\n~ * \u2202 \u03bd \u03c6),\n~\n(\u2202\u03bc \u03c6\n\u039b4\n\n(3.11)\n\nwith \u039b = mPl /\u03be and the ci cannot be much smaller than O(4\u03c0)\u22122 without fine tuning. In addition,\n~ * \u03c6)\n~ 3 /\u039b2 and\nthe quantum field theory will also generate corrections to the potential, such as c\u03041 \u03bb2 (\u03c6\n~ * \u03c6)\n~ 4 /\u039b4 . Note the factor of \u03bb2 here, which arises because the potential is protected by a\nc\u03042 \u03bb2 (\u03c6\nshift symmetry in the \u03bb \u2192 0 limit.\nHow do such operators affect the inflationary model? Lets focus on the end of inflation where\n\u221a\n\u03c6 \u223c mPl / \u03be. Here the kinetic and potential terms in the classical Lagrangian are comparable, with\nvalue V \u223c (\u2202\u03c6)2 \u223c \u03bb m4Pl /\u03be 2 . The new dimension 8 operators would be \u223c c \u03bb2 m4Pl ; parametrically\nlarger than the included operators by a factor c \u03bb \u03be 2 , destroying the theory for \u03be \u001d 1. This is\nrelevant to the Standard Model Higgs which is comprised of multiple scalars. It should be pointed\nout that the above reasoning is based on a perturbative analysis around h\u03c6i = 0, which is obviously\n\u221a\n\u221a\nnot true during inflation, where h\u03c6i \u223c Ne mPl / \u03be. However, the moment inflation ends, the field\nwill oscillate around h\u03c6i = 0 and the above analysis is essentially correct, i.e., the multiple degrees\nof freedom will interact strongly. This means, unfortunately, that one cannot describe the reheating\nera using this low energy effective field theory, or connect inflation to low energy Higgs physics.\n\n4. An Analogy - the Pion Lagrangian\nIf this distinction between the behavior of a single scalar field theory compared to a multiple scalar\nfield theory seems strange, let us recall a familiar case where the same is true.\nConsider the Lagrangian of the \u03c3-model\n\u03bc2\n\u03bb\n1\nL = \u2212 \u2202\u03c6n \u2202\u03c6n + \u03c6n \u03c6n \u2212 (\u03c6n \u03c6n )2\n2\n2\n4\n\n(4.1)\n\nwhere n is summed over n = 1, 2, . . . , N, N + 1, with the first N components forming a vector\n~ and the last component \u03c6N +1 a scalar. After spontaneous symmetry breaking, it is useful to\n\u03c6\nuse fields that make it manifest that the potential only depends on the length of \u03c6n , which we\npP\n2\n~\ncall \u03c3(x) \u2261\nn \u03c6n (x) , and the Goldstone bosons, which we call \u03b6(x). Following Ref. [33] the\noriginal Lagrangian can be recast as\n1\n\u2202 \u03b6~ * \u2202 \u03b6~\n\u03bc2\n\u03bb\n+ \u03c32 \u2212 \u03c34.\n(4.2)\nL = \u2212 (\u2202\u03c3)2 \u2212 2\u03c3 2\n2\n~\n~\n2\n2\n4\n(1 + \u03b6 * \u03b6)\n\u221a\nAt low energies, the massive field \u03c3 will relax to its minimum at h\u03c3i = \u03bc/ \u03bb. By defining F \u2261 2h\u03c3i\n~\nand introducing properly normalized Goldstone bosons ~\u03c0 (x) \u2261 F \u03b6(x),\nthe low energy Lagrangian\n\n\u20138\u2013\n\n\ffor the Goldstone bosons is\nL=\u2212\n\n\u2202~\u03c0 * \u2202~\u03c0\n1\n.\n2 (1 + ~\u03c0 * ~\u03c0 /F 2 )2\n\n(4.3)\n\nFor 3 pions it is well known that this theory breaks down for energies much larger than F , which\ncan be confirmed by computing scattering amplitudes. A rough estimate for the breakdown of the\nquantum theory is \u039b = 4\u03c0F , where the 4\u03c0 comes from loop integrals.\nThe 2 \u2192 2 tree-level scattering process has the matrix element\nM(\u03c0a + \u03c0b \u2192 \u03c0c + \u03c0d )\n= 4F \u22122 [\u03b4ab \u03b4cd (\u2212pa pb \u2212 pc pd ) + \u03b4ac \u03b4bd (pa pc + pb pd ) + \u03b4ad \u03b4bc (pa pd + pb pc )]\n\n(4.4)\n\nwhich is non-zero whenever some of the a, b, c, d are different (scaling as \u223c E 2 /F 2 ), but is zero\nif a = b = c = d and the \u03c0's are put on-shell (p2 = 0). The latter is the case for a single field.\nThe same is true for loop corrections. As earlier, what is special about the N = 1 case is that the\nLagrangian (4.3) is really a free field theory in disguise (which can be made manifest through a\nfield redefinition), but it is unambiguously an interacting field theory for N > 1.\nOn the other hand, even for N = 1, if we explicitly break the global symmetry, then the\n(pseudo)-Goldstone bosons acquire a mass and a potential V . This potential is non-polynomial\nand likely causes the theory to fail for E \u001d F .\n\n5. Curvature-Squared Models\nLet us now turn to another type of non-standard model for inflation, which comes from the inclusion\nof curvature-squared terms in the action [34]\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ\n1 2\n4 \u221a\n2\nS = d x \u2212g mPl R + \u03b6 R ,\n(5.1)\n2\nwith \u03b6 = O(108 ) to achieve the correct amplitude of density fluctuations. Although we consider\nthis model to be ad hoc and not necessarily \"natural\", it is still worthwhile to discuss whether this\ntheory makes sensible inflationary predictions or not.\nSince \u03b6 \u001d 1 we again should ask if scattering amplitudes become large at energies well below\nmPl . In particular, by expanding around flat space, the curvature-squared term introduces the\nfollowing dimension 6 and 7 operators into the action\n\u03b6\n(\u0003h)2 ,\nm2Pl\n\n\u03b6\n(\u0003h)2 h,\nm3Pl\n\n(5.2)\n\nrespectively. The former modifies the graviton propagator at high energies. The latter introduces\na 3-point vertex, which can be used to construct tree-level graviton-graviton scattering processes.\nIn particular, each of the t, u, and s-channels scale to leading order as\nMc (2 h\u03bc\u03bd \u2192 2 h\u03bc\u03bd ) \u223c\n\n\u20139\u2013\n\n\u03b6 2E6\n,\nm6Pl\n\n(5.3)\n\n\fsuggesting that the theory violates unitarity above the cutoff \u039b = mPl /\u03b6 1/3 , as claimed recently\nin [17] and criticized on that basis. However, as was the case in Section 3.1, if we sum over all\ndiagrams, then this piece vanishes. Instead, the leading non-zero piece scales as Mtot \u223c (E/mPl )2 .\n(Note that there is also a 4-point graviton vertex and that the correction to the graviton propagator\nis important here). So according to the tree-level analysis of 2 \u2192 2 scattering, the correct cutoff is\n\u039b = mPl .\nThe most transparent way to analyze the perturbative quantum corrections to this theory is\nin the frame in which the degrees of freedom are manifest and to use fields with diagonal kinetic\nsectors. Since the Jordan frame contains higher derivatives, due to the R2 term, we choose to\nswitch to the Einstein frame to make the degrees of freedom manifest. Ref. [17] claimed that this\ntheory fails equally in any frame, including the Einstein frame. So lets re-write the action as a\nscalar-tensor theory. This involves a canonical gravity sector, a canonical kinetic sector for some\nscalar \u03c3, and a potential VE (\u03c3) which exhibits O(1) variations on \u2206\u03c3 \u223c mPl . It can be shown that\nthis gives\nZ\nS=\n\n\u0014\n\u00112 \u0015\np\n\u221a\n1 2\n1\nm4Pl \u0010\n2\nm RE \u2212 (\u2202\u03c3) \u2212\n1 \u2212 exp(\u2212 2/3 \u03c3/mPl )\n.\nd x \u2212gE\n2 Pl\n2\n16 \u03b6\n4\n\n(5.4)\n\nThis action seems rather innocuous, but according to Ref. [17] this theory still has a cutoff at\n\u039b = mPl /\u03b6 1/3 . We begin by explaining how one could arrive at this conclusion by a naive power\ncounting estimate. We then explain why this is incorrect and why the correct answer is \u039b = mPl .\nm2\n\nPl 2\n\u03c3 + . . . We see that the\nLet us expand the potential about its minimum at \u03c3 = 0: VE (\u03c3) = 24\u03b6\n2\n2\nfield \u03c3 has a mass-squared of m\u03c3 = mPl /(12 \u03b6). This non-zero mass will obviously play an important\nrole in computing low energy scattering amplitudes. For instance, consider the 1-loop scattering\nprocess involving 2 \u2192 2 graviton scattering due to \u03c3 running in a loop. We use 4 insertions of the\nfollowing 3-point interaction term from the kinetic sector\n\n\u223c\n\nh\n(\u2202\u03c3)2 .\nmPl\n\nThis gives rise to the following contribution to the matrix element\nZ\n1\nq1 *q2 q2 *q3 q3 *q4 q4 *q1\nM(2 h\u03bc\u03bd \u2192 2 h\u03bc\u03bd ) \u223c 4\nd4 q 2\n.\n2\nmPl\n(q1 \u2212 m\u03c3 )(q22 \u2212 m2\u03c3 )(q32 \u2212 m2\u03c3 )(q42 \u2212 m2\u03c3 )\n\n(5.5)\n\n(5.6)\n\nThis loop integral can be estimated using, for instance, dimensional regularization. Its scaling\ndepends critically on the energy scale. For input energy E \u001c m\u03c3 , the denominator can be approximated as m8\u03c3 . If one were to then approximate the numerator with the high energy behavior, the\nfinite part would be estimated as\nM(2 h\u03bc\u03bd \u2192 2 h\u03bc\u03bd ) \u223c\n\n\u03b3 4 E 12\nE 12\n\u223c\n.\nm4Pl m8\u03c3\nm12\nPl\n\n\u2013 10 \u2013\n\n(5.7)\n\n\fIf this scaling were correct up to arbitrarily high energies, then indeed the theory would have a\ncutoff at \u039b = mPl /\u03b6 1/3 . However, this scaling is invalid at high energies. Instead, for E \u001d m\u03c3 , the\nmatrix element scales as\nE4\nM(2 h\u03bc\u03bd \u2192 2 h\u03bc\u03bd ) \u223c 4 ,\n(5.8)\nmPl\nindicating that the correct cutoff is \u039b = mPl . A similar argument for the cutoff goes through for\nany scattering process, including tree-level or arbitrary loop level.\nHence, if low energy scattering amplitudes are taken at face value, they naively suggest that\nthe theory has a cutoff at mPl /\u03b6 1/3 . However, a full calculation at the appropriate energy scale\nreveals that the correct cutoff of the scalar-tensor theory defined by (5.4) is mPl . This is because\nthe potential varies on scales \u2206\u03c3 \u223c mPl . This means that the inflationary predictions make sense.\n\n6. Conclusions\nTreated classically, a singlet scalar \u03c6 with non-minimal coupling to gravity \u03be\u03c62 R and \u03be \u001d 1 can\ndrive a phase of slow-roll inflation. By examining the gravity and kinetic sectors alone, as in\nRef. [17], it is tempting to declare that such theories become strongly interacting at mPl /\u03be, which\nwould spoil the model. Such a conclusion arises from power counting estimates of scattering processes in the Jordan frame without summing all diagrams to check for any possible cancellations.\nHere we have shown that cancellations do occur in the single field case, giving a Planckian cutoff.\nHowever, the potential sector is problematic: the Einstein frame potential is non-polynomial, varying on scales \u2206\u03c3 \u223c mPl /\u03be. Although its Coleman-Weinberg quantum corrections [31] are small and\nthe behavior of such a theory is considered an open problem in field theory, it is doubtful if high\nenergy scattering amplitudes could be well behaved and if there is any sensible UV completion of\nthe theory. This suggests that the true cutoff is \u223c mPl /\u03be due to the potential sector.\nOn the other hand, these power counting estimates in the gravity and kinetic sectors do apply in\n~ is problematic as \u03c6a +\u03c6b \u2192 \u03c6c +\u03c6d scattering becomes strong\nthe multi-field case: a vector of fields \u03c6\nat energies E & mPl /\u03be relevant to inflation (as noted in [17, 32]) and large quantum corrections are\ngenerated. This requires new physics to intervene or that something peculiar happens in the RG\nflow that rescues the theory, such as flow to a UV fixed point. But the latter scenario seems rather\nunlikely. Our conclusions were shown to be true in both the Jordan and Einstein frames.\nSo if the Standard Model Higgs were a gauge singlet, then Higgs-inflation would be well behaved\nin the pure gravity and kinetic sectors, requiring a detailed analysis of the potential sector to draw\nconclusions about the quantum theory. However, since it is comprised of 4 real scalars in a complex\ndoublet, it falls into the multi-field category and fails even at the level of tree-level scattering\ndue to graviton exchange; breaking down due to Goldstone bosons. Explicitly identifying this\ndifference between the single field case and the multi-field case was previously missed by us [15]\nand others. Similarly, this may spoil other attempts to embed inflation into particle physics models\nwith multiple scalar fields [35], unless the underlying UV theory carries an appropriate structure.\n\n\u2013 11 \u2013\n\n\fOur conclusions were drawn from an expansion around h\u03c6i = 0. Although one might be\nconcerned that this does not reflect the inflationary regime where h\u03c6i is large, it does accurately\nreflect the end of inflation (the reheating era) in which \u03c6 oscillates around \u03c6 = 0. Hence our\nconclusions are quite robust in demonstrating that the reheating era cannot be described within\neffective field theory, i.e., that the effective Lagrangian must have large corrections as we approach\ninflationary energy densities. Thus altering the inflationary Lagrangian itself.\nWe also examined curvature-squared models \u03b6 R2 [34] with \u03b6 \u001d 1 (although we consider such\nmodels to be ad hoc). They were recently criticized in Ref. [17] for failing to even make sense\nat scales E & mPl /\u03b6 1/3 . Again there exists cancellation among tree-level diagrams, suggesting a\nPlanckian cutoff. Furthermore, by formulating the quantum theory as a scalar-tensor theory in\nthe Einstein frame (which makes the degrees of freedom manifest) we showed that the inflationary\ntheory is well behaved. In this case, all scattering processes, whether they arise from the gravity or\nkinetic or potential sectors, satisfy unitarity bounds and generate very small quantum corrections\nfor energies below mPl . The reason for this is that we have a singlet model with potential that\nvaries on scales \u2206\u03c3 \u223c mPl (as opposed to non-minimally coupled models which vary on scales\n\u2206\u03c3 \u223c mPl /\u03be.)\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank R.
