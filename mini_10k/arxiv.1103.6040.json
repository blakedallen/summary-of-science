The quest for the systems with ultralong spin relaxation times [2] is one of the main challenges in this field. Since the dynamical spin fluctuations\n[3] characterized by correlations on the spin relaxation\ntimescale, are seen as a spin noise in the frequency domain, this search can be done with recently developed\nhighly accurate low-frequency spin noise spectroscopy [4]\naimed at the measurement of intrinsic equilibrium spin\ndynamics. The spin noise spectroscopy allows to study\nthe slow spin dynamics in (110)-grown quantum wells [5]\nand in quantum dots [6]. Theoretical background of this\nmethod is given, e.g., in Refs. [7\u20139].\nAn interesting class of semiconductor nanostructures\ndemonstrating peculiar and slow spin dynamics are the\nquantum wires [10\u201312], where e.g. InAs, InSb as well as\nGaAs/AlGaAs systems are the prospective realizations.\nThe effects of spin-orbit (SO) coupling on the transport\nwere clearly demonstrated there [13, 14] and the nanowire\nbased qubits were introduced [15, 16]. A SO coupling induced effective magnetic field acting on electron spins in\nnanowires is directed parallel or antiparallel to a certain\naxis [17\u201321] resulting in a giant spin relaxation anisotropy\nsimilar to that expected in some two-dimensional systems [22]. Since the SO coupling is a structure- and\nmaterial-dependent property, all sorts of disorder (random doping [23\u201326], interface fluctuations [27], random\nvariations in the shape, etc.) which cause electron scattering and nonzero resistivity, can cause local variations\nin the coupling. As a result, in addition to the regular SO\ncoupling, caused by the lack of bulk (Dresselhaus term)\nor structure (Rashba term) inversion symmetry, all lowdimensional structures inevitably have the random contribution in it. The spatial scale of the fluctuations is of\nthe order of 10 nm as determined by the characteristic\ndistances in nanostructure were shown to give rise to a\nnumber of fascinating phenomena [28\u201330]. However, their\nrole in quantum wires was not studied so far.\nHere we address theoretically the electron spin dynamics in ballistic and diffusive semiconductor nanowires aim-\n\nFigure 1: Schematic plot of the experimental configuration: a\nquantum wire (dark stripe) is illuminated by a linearly polarized beam and Kerr rotation angle of its polarization plane \u03b8K\nis measured. Polarizations of the beams are marked by doubleheaded arrows. Dashed arrow corresponds to the polarization\nof the reflected beam in the absence of the Kerr effect.\n\ning at the study of the spin noise spectrum. Different\nregimes of electron spin relaxation are determined and\nthe crossovers between them are analyzed in detail. In\nparticular, we demonstrate that when the electron motion is diffusive and the dominant contribution to the SO\ninteraction is random, the spin relaxation becomes algebraic rather than exponential and the spin noise power\nspectrum diverges at low frequencies \u03c9 as 1/\u03c9 1/2 , showing colored noise [31\u201333] well suited for the studies by the\nspin noise spectroscopy. A very slow spin dynamics resulting in the low-frequency noise divergence makes nanowires\nan exception among semiconductor systems.\nThe spin noise spectroscopy, reviewed in Ref. [4], is\nbased on the optical monitoring of the spin fluctuations\n[34] in Faraday, Kerr or ellipticity signals measured with\na weak linearly polarized probe beam incident on a single\nwire or a wire array sample, see Fig. 1. It can be shown\nsimilarly to Refs. [4, 9, 35] that for the probe tuned to\nthe fundamental absorption edge, the Kerr rotation angle\n\u03b8K \u221d sz [40], hence its autocorrelation function is directly\nrelated to the spin noise: h\u03b8K (t)\u03b8K (t\u2032 )i \u221d hsz (t)sz (t\u2032 )i,\nwhere sz (t) is the density of the z\u2212component of the total\nelectron spin. As a result, this optical technique measures\nlong-range correlations of equilibrium spin fluctuations occurring in the illuminated spot.\nWe consider a single channel quantum wire extended\n\n\f2\nalong the x\u2212axis and represent the SO Hamiltonian as:\nHSO =\n\n1\n[\u03b1(x)kx + kx \u03b1(x)]\u03c3\u03bb .\n2\n\n(1)\n\nHere kx = \u2212i\u2202/\u2202x is the electron wave vector component\nalong the wire axis, \u03b1(x) is the coordinate-dependent SO\ncoupling strength. In Eq. (1) we assumed that the spin\nquantization axis, \u03bb, is fixed, and \u03c3\u03bb is the component of\nspin operator along this axis. The specific form of the SO\nHamiltonian Eq. (1) implies that the effective field acting\non electron spin points either parallel or antiparallel to\nthe axis \u03bb. This is obvious for a constant \u03b1(x) [17\u201321],\nand holds true provided that the microscopic symmetry\nof the fluctuations forming the SO coupling randomness\nis the same as overall symmetry of the system.\nThe SO coupling is assumed to be the sum of the\ncoordinate-independent contribution, \u03b10 , and the Gaussian random function with zero average, \u03b1r (x) such as\n\u03b1(x) = \u03b10 + \u03b1r (x) with the correlation function [29]:\nh\u03b1r (x)\u03b1r (x\u2032 )i = h\u03b12r iFcorr (x \u2212 x\u2032 ),\n\n(2)\n\nwhere h\u03b12r i is the mean square of SO coupling fluctuations\nand the range function Fcorr (x \u2212 x\u2032 ). We introduce also\nthe typical correlation length of the SO coupling\nZ \u221e\nFcorr (x)dx,\n(3)\nld =\n0\n\ncharacterizing the size of the correlated domain of the\nrandom SO coupling. Details of the models of random\nSO coupling can be found in Ref.[29].\nWe begin with the semiclassical regime, where SO coupling disorder is smooth on the scale of electron wavelength, ld \u226b \u03bbF , where the wavelength of the Fermi level\nelectrons \u03bbF = 2\u03c0/kF , with kF being the Fermi wave vector for the degenerate electron gas. The Hamiltonian (1)\nimplies that the spin rotation angle around the \u03bb-axis during the motion from the point x0 to x1 is\nZ\n2m x1\n\u03b8(x1 , x0 ) = 2\n\u03b1(x\u2032 )dx\u2032 ,\n(4)\n~ x0\nwhere m is the electron effective mass. Eq. (4) shows that\nthe angle is solely determined by electron initial and final\npositions and does not depend on the history of the motion\nbetween these points. This result, being well established\nfor the systems with regular SO coupling [20, 36\u201339] holds\nalso for the nanowires with the SO coupling disorder. As\nit follows from Eq. (1) the spin precession rate is proportional to the electron velocity and given coordinatedependent function. Hence, it does not matter whether\nthe electron starting from the point x0 reached the point\nx1 ballistically or diffusively: all contributions to spin precession of the closed paths, where electron passes the same\nconfiguration of \u03b1(x) in the opposite directions, cancel\neach other.\nThe temporal evolution of electron spin is directly related the electron motion along the wire. We consider\nhere spin projections at given z axis, perpendicular to the\nspin quantization axis \u03bb. Time dependence of electron\n\nspin z component averaged over its random spatial motion and over the random precession caused by the field\n\u03b1(x) can be most conveniently characterized by the correlator hsz (t)sz (0)i = hs2z (0)iCss (t) with the normalized\ncorrelation function:\nZ \u221e\nCss (t) =\ndx p(x, t)hcos [\u03b8(x, 0)]i,\n(5)\n\u2212\u221e\n\nwhere p(x, t) is the probability that electron travels distance x during the time t. Note, that Css (t) can be understood as disorder-averaged electron spin z component\nfound with the initial condition sz (0) = 1. It results from\nthe linearity of the spin dynamics equations: the correlators hsi (t)sj (0)i satisfy exactly the same equations as average values hsi (t)i (i, j = x, y, z). In derivation of Eq. (5)\nwe assumed also that the scattering of electrons, which\ndetermines p(x, t) is not correlated with the random SO\nfield \u03b1r (x), hence, the averaging over the realizations of\n\u03b1r (x) denoted by the angular brackets and over the trajectories can be considered independently. This can occur\nin nanowires where random Rashba fields are induced by\ndoping while the momentum scattering is due to the wire\nwidth fluctuations. If the same local disorder determines\nthe electron scattering and random SO fields, in relatively\nclean systems the electron mean free path l exceeds by far\nthe disorder correlation length ld in Eq.(3). Hence, spatial\nscales of two random processes: l for the electron backward scattering in the random potential and ld for the\nspin precession are strongly different. As a result, on the\nl-scale, the memory of the short-range correlations is lost,\nand Eq. (5) holds. Although Eq. (5) is presented for the\nsmooth SO coupling disorder, where the electron motion\nis semiclassical, ld /\u03bbF \u226b 1, a general Green's function\napproach confirms it for arbitrary ld /\u03bbF values.\nOur next step is to perform averaging of cos [\u03b8(x, 0)] in\nEq. (5) over the random realizations of the \u03b1(x)-field. For\nthis purpose we recast\n\u0013\n\u001b\n\u001a\n\u0012\n2m\u03b10\ncos [\u03b8(x, 0)] = Re exp i 2 x exp [i\u03b8r (x)] , (6)\n~\nwhere\n\u03b8r (x) = 2m/~\n\n2\n\nZ\n\nx\n\n\u03b1r (x\u2032 )dx\u2032\n\n(7)\n\n0\n\nis the contribution of the random SO coupling into the\nspin rotation angle. We expand last exponent in series\nin \u03b8r assuming the Gaussian SO coupling disorder. In\nthe averaging, odd powers of spin rotation angle vanish,\nh\u03b8r2n+1 (x)i = 0, for integer n and even powers can be\nexpressed solely with h\u03b8r2 (x)i as\n*\u0014\n\u00152n +\nZ\n2m x\n\u2032\n\u2032\n2n\n= (2n\u22121)!!h\u03b8r2 (x)in .\n\u03b1r (x )dx\nh\u03b8r (x)i =\n~2 0\n(8)\nDirect calculation shows that the mean square h\u03b8r2 (x)i\ncaused by the random SO interaction is given by\n\u00132\n\u0012\nZ x\nZ x\u2032\n2m\n2\n\u2032\nh\u03b1\ni\ndx\ndyFcorr (y).

Equation (10) is our central result: it relates temporal average spin dynamics with electron motion along the wire. Distribution function of electron displacements, p(x, t), presented for different regimes\nof electron motion below, enables us to calculate spin evolution by Eq. (10). The spin noise power spectrum is given\nby the transform of Css (t) [9]:\nZ \u221e\nCss (t) cos (\u03c9t) dt.\n(11)\ns2z \u03c9 = 2\n0\n\nTo get a better insight into the problem, we begin with\nthe key limits [41]. First, for the ballistic electron dynamics p(x, t) = \u03b4(x \u2212 vF t), where vF = ~kF /m is the Fermi\nvelocity. The ballistic motion is realized on the temporal\nscale t \u226a \u03c4 = l/vF with \u03c4 being the momentum relaxation time. We are interested in the spin dynamics on\nthe time scale t \u226b \u03c4d = ld /vF , where \u03c4d is the time during which electron passes the correlated interval of the SO\ncoupling fluctuations. Using Eq. (10) we obtain damped\noscillations of the spin z-component:\nCss (t) \u2248 cos (\u03a90 t) exp (\u2212t/\u03c4s,r ),\n\n(12)\n\nwith the frequency \u03a90 = 2m\u03b10 vF /~2 determined by the\naveraged SO coupling and the decay time caused by the\nSO coupling fluctuations\n\u00132\n\u0012\n2mvF\n1\n=\nh\u03b12r i\u03c4d .\n(13)\n\u03c4s,r\n~2\nEquation (13) for the spin relaxation time \u03c4s,r is a result of\nrandom spin precession [29]. Spin noise power spectrum\ncalculated using Eqs. (11) and (12) reads:\ns2z\n\n\u03c9\n\n= 2\u03c4s,r Re\n\n1 \u2212 i\u03c9\u03c4s,r\n2 + (1 \u2212 i\u03c9\u03c4 )2\n\u03a920 \u03c4s,r\ns,r\n\n(14)\n\nwith the result presented in Fig. 2.\nThis ballistic regime of spin dynamics, however, can be\nrealized only in very clean systems, where \u03a90 \u03c4 \u226b 1. Otherwise, electron spin evolution occurs at the time scale,\nwhere electron moves diffusively (Fig.3, upper panel), i.e.\n2\n1\ne\u2212x /4Dt ,\np(x, t) = \u221a\n2 \u03c0Dt\n\n(15)\n\nwhere D = vF2 \u03c4 is the diffusion coefficient. In the\nabsence of the SO coupling fluctuations and provided\nthat \u03a90 \u03c4 \u226a 1 exponential spin relaxation is due to the\nDyakonov-Perel' mechanism [17, 21] with the relaxation\ntime \u03c4s,DP = 1/(\u03a920 \u03c4 ). The spin noise spectrum has a\n2\nLorentzian form hs2z i\u03c9 = 2\u03c4s,DP /(1 + \u03c9 2 \u03c4s,DP\n) with the\nwidth determined by the relaxation time.\nNew physical features arise when the SO coupling fluctuations dominate over the regular contribution.

At these times, the system in Eq. (10) is characterized by two\u221alength parameters.\nOne parameter is the diffusion length Dt in Eq. (15), the\nother one\nZ \u221e\n\u0002\n\u0003\ndx exp \u2212h\u03b8r2 (x)i/2 ,\n(16)\nLs =\n0\n\ncharacterizes \u221aspin randomization. At sufficiently long\ntimes, when Dt \u226b Ls , one can take p(0, t) instead of\np(x, t) and immediately obtain from Eq. (10) that the relaxation is algebraic rather than exponential:\nZ \u221e\n\u0002\n\u0003\nLs\nCss (t) \u2248 p(0, t)\ndx exp \u2212h\u03b8r2 (x)i/2 = \u221a\n. (17)\n\u03c0Dt\n\u2212\u221e\n\nEquation (17) predicts extremely long spin decoherence\n\u221a\ndescribed by the inverse square root law: hsz (t)i \u221d 1/ t.\nThis surprising result has a transparent physical interpretation (see Fig. 3): Indeed, if an electron is displaced\nfrom its initial position by a sufficiently large distance,\nx & Ls , its spin rotation angle becomes so large, that\nit does not\u0002 contribute \u0003to the total spin polarization owing to exp \u2212h\u03b8r2 (x)i/2 in Eq. (10). As a result, the spin\npolarization is supported by the electrons located in the\nvicinity of their initial positions, mainly due to the return\nafter multiple scatterings by the random potential. The\nfraction of such electrons, in agreement\n\u221a with the diffusion distribution, decays as p(0, t) \u221d 1/ t resulting in the\nsame behavior in the spin polarization. It is interesting\nto mention that this qualitative argument does not work\nfor the constant SO coupling despite spin of electron is\nrestored upon the return to the origin also here. The reason is that due the oscillations of the spin on the spatial\nscale of the order of ~2 /m\u03b10 (see Fig. 3, lower panel) in\nEq.(10), the diffusive return of electrons to the origin is\ninsufficient for formation of the algebraic\nrelaxation tail.\n\u221a\nAnother realization of the 1/ t spin decay can be\nachieved for the very strong random SO couping where\nthe spin relaxation occurs within one nanosize domain of\nthe SO coupling, that is at the electron displacement much\n\n\f4\nBasque Country UPV/EHU grant GIU07/40, MCI of\nSpain grant FIS2009-12773-C02-01, and \"Grupos Consolidados UPV/EHU del Gobierno Vasco\" grant IT-472-10.\n\nFigure 3: Upper panel: Schematic illustration of the displacements distribution p(x, t) for two different time moments:\nt0 < t1 . Lower panels: The quantum wire and spins of diffusing electron for the random and regular SO couplings, respectively. For the random SO coupling, if the electron is within\nthe Ls distance from its initial point [see Eq. (17)] its spin is\npreserved, when it leaves this interval, the spin dephases.\n\nless than ld . In this case, spin relaxation rate is due to\nthe Dyakonov-Perel' mechanism and is determined by the\nlocal value of \u03b1(x) inside the domain. Spins of electrons located in the intervals with large \u03b1(x) will relax fast, while\nspins of those experiencing weak \u03b1(x) will relax slow.\nSlow non-exponential spin relaxation, described by\nEq. (17) manifests itself in the low frequency spin\n\u221a noise\nspectrum. From Eq. (11) it follows: s2z \u03c9 \u221d 1/ \u03c9, i.e\nthe spin noise diverges at \u03c9 \u2192 0. Such a non-trivial behavior is inherent to the quantum wires with random SO\ncoupling, where spin restores upon return to the origin: in\nmultichannel wires for sufficiently fast interchannel scattering [42] and in two-dimensional systems spin relaxation\nis exponential [29] and s2z \u03c9=0 is finite.\nTo conclude, we studied theoretically spin noise in semiconductor nanowire for different regimes of the electron\npropagation. We demonstrated that if the spin relaxation\nis determined by the randomness in the SO coupling, spin\nrelaxation becomes algebraic being closely related to the\nhigh probability for electron to stay close to its initial position as a result of a multiple scatterings in the random\npotential. This behavior can appear in at least two possible regimes: (i) when the electron motion is diffusive and\n(ii) when the spin relaxation occurs on a small spatial\nscale of the order of 10 nm. In any of these\n\u221a cases, the spin\nnoise power spectrum shows colored 1/ \u03c9 noise. In addition, this observation shows that low-frequency optical\nspin noise spectroscopy is an excellent tool for studying\nspin phenomena in semiconductor nanowires and characterization of random potential and SO coupling there.\nAcknowledgements MMG is grateful to RFBR and\n\"Dynasty\" Foundation-ICFPM for financial support.\nThis work of EYS was supported by the University of\n\n\u2217\nElectronic address: glazov@coherent.ioffe.ru\n[1] I.

SPIN NOISE AT ARBITRARY FREQUENCIES\n\nHere we determine the spin noise spectrum for arbitrary\nfrequencies \u03c9. We employ the kinetic equation for electron\ndistribution function f (x, vx , t) dependent on the position,\nvelocity vx , and time. The equation has the form:\n\n(kl)2\n\n\u03c4 (1 \u2212 i\u03c9\u03c4 )\n.\n\u2212 i\u03c9\u03c4 (1 \u2212 i\u03c9\u03c4 )\n\n(S2)\n\nIn accordance with Eq.

(S6) that at low frequencies, \u03c9 \u226a\n\u03c4d\u22121 , \u03c4 \u22121 , spin noise spectrum has the form:\n\n(S1)\n\nwhere f (x, vx , t) satisfies the initial condition f (x, vx , 0) =\n\u03b4(x)[\u03b4v,vF + \u03b4v,\u2212vF ]/2 meaning that at t = 0 it is built at\nx = 0 with the equal fractions of electrons with velocities vx = \u00b1vF . As a result, the carriers can be separated into the right movers, vx = vF , and left movers,\nvx = \u2212vF with function f \u0304 = [f (x, vF , t) \u2212 f (x, \u2212vF , t)]/2\nbeing the anisotropic part of the distribution. The distribution of electron displacements is given by p(x, t) =\nf (x, vF , t) + f (x, \u2212vF , t). It can be shown that the spatial\nFourier transform and cos(\u03c9t) transform of this distribution, p\u0303(k, \u03c9) has the form\np\u0303(k, \u03c9) = 2 Re\n\nhs2z i\u03c9 = 2 Re\n\ns2z \u03c9\n\n\u221a\n2\u03c4s,r\n,\n= \u221a\n\u03c9\u03c4\n\n(S7)\n\nin agreement with the analysis above.

SPIN DYNAMICS AND NOISE IN\nMULTICHANNEL WIRES WITH RANDOM\nSPIN-ORBIT COUPLING\n\nThe spin evolution in multichannel structures depends\non the additional set of parameters, {\u03c4i,j } being the scattering times between the channels i and j, as well as on the\n\n\f6\ndetails of spin dynamics in every channel. For qualitative\nanalysis (a general case requires a separate treatment) we\nconsider a structure with two conducting channels, where\n(i) spin-orbit coupling disorder in different channels is not\n[c]\ncorrelated and (ii) in each channel \u03a9r \u03c4d \u226a 1 (superscripts denote channels), i.e. spin rotation angles in correlated domains of the spin-orbit coupling are always small.\nHere we can characterize the interchannel scattering by a\nsingle time \u03c4c and focus on the most interesting case with\nno regular contribution to the spin-orbit field: \u03b10 \u2261 0.\nIn the limit of very rare interchannel scattering events\n(the condition is given below) the channels are independent. Hence, the general results expressed by Eqs. (10),\n(11) of the main text and by Eq. (S6) as well as asymptotic Eqs. (S7) and (17) of the main text hold. Although in\nthese equations one has to average over the realizations of\n[c]\nthe low-frequency spin noise\n\u03b1r (x) in different channels, \u221a\npower spectrum remains 1/ \u03c9, the same as in a single\nchannel wire.\nNow we turn to the efficient interchannel scattering with\nshort \u03c4c . If \u03c4c \u226a \u03c4d electron quits given channel faster\nthan it quits the correlated domain. Spin rotations between interchannel scattering events are uncorrelated and,\ndue to this randomness, spin dynamics is exponential:\nhsz (t)sz (0)i \u221d exp (\u2212\u0393c t),\n\n(S8)\n\nwhere\nrate \u0393c is of the order of\nh\nn the relaxation\noi2\n[1]\n[2]\nmax \u03a9r , \u03a9r\n\u03c4c . Similar exponential decay of the\nspin correlator remains for \u03c4d \u226a \u03c4c \u226a \u03c4 . Here, the mean\nsquare of the spin rotation angle between interchannel\nscatterings can be estimated as h(\u03b4\u03a6)2 i = h\u03b8r2 (v [c] \u03c4c )i \u221d\n\u03c4c , with v [c] being the characteristic velocity in the channel. Spin relaxation is governed by the Dyakonov-Perel'like mechanism, with the rate\n\u22121\n,\n\u0393 \u221d h(\u03b4\u03a6)2 i/\u03c4c \u223c \u03c4s,r\n\n(S9)\n\nwhich is \u03c4c -independent for exactly the same reason as the\n\nspin relaxation rate due to the random spin-orbit [Eq.(13)\nin the main text] does not explicitly depend on the electron free path.\nMost interesting physics appears for a very weak interchannel scattering, \u03c4c \u226b \u03c4, \u03c4d . In this case, electron\nmoves diffusively in a given channel before the interchan\u221a\nnel scattering occurs. As we have shown above, the\n\u221a 1/ t\ntail in the spin polarization (and corresponding 1/ \u03c9 spin\nnoise) results from the carriers dwelling around the initial\npoint of\n\u221a their trajectories. Since the tail is formed at long\ntimes Dt \u226b Ls , see Eq. (16) of the main text, it is supported by electrons which moved many times back and\nforth in the random potential. If the interchannel scattering is probable, electron may return to the initial point\nvia other channels, where its spin rotation is not correlated\n\u221a\nwith that in the initial one. Therefore, in general 1/ t\ntail is destroyed and the usual exponential spin relaxation\ntakes place. However, if \u03c4c is long enough to assure that\nthe typical electron displacement during\n\u221a the diffusion between interchannel scatterings Lc = D\u03c4c \u226b Ls , there\nis a time interval L2s /D \u226a t \u226a \u03c4c and the corresponding\nfrequency range, where the spin dynamics and the noise\nare algebraic:\n1\n1\nhsz (t)sz (0)i \u221d \u221a , hs2z i\u03c9 \u221d \u221a .\n\u03c9\nt\n\n(S10)\n\nIn the regimes of a highly efficient interchannel scattering,\nwith the spin relaxation described by Eqs.(S8) or (S9), the\nprobability of spin components restoration upon return to\nthe initial position is strongly suppressed, and, as a result,\nspin noise power spectrum at low frequency decreases and\nbecomes finite.\nFor completeness, we mention that if the random spinorbit coupling does not depend on the channel, that is\n[1]\n[2]\n\u03b1r (x) = \u03b1r (x), spin precession angle between any points\nx1 and x2 is insensitive to the interchannel scattering, and\nour analysis in the main text holds exactly the same.\n\n\f"}
