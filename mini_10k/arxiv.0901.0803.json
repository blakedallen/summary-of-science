Meadows may be viewed as a generalization of so-called zero totalized\nfields, being fields in which division is made total by setting 0\u22121 = 0. Thanks to a\ncharacterization theorem in [3], however, a meadow can also be defined as a commutative\nring with unit equipped with a total unary operation x\u22121 , named inverse, that satisfies\nthese two additional equations:\n(x\u22121 )\u22121 = x\nx * (x * x\u22121 ) = x\n1\n\nEmail: j.a.bergstra@uva.nl\nEmail: joram@post.tau.ac.il\n3\nEmail: j.v.tucker@swansea.ac.uk\n2\n\n1\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\n\fThe first equation is called Ref , the second equation is called Ril.\nPerhaps the clearest way to specify the class of meadows is as the smallest variety\ncontaining all zero-totalized fields. This is a matter of taste to some extent.\nCommutative meadows provide an analysis of division which is more general than\nthat of the classical theory of fields. Commutative meadows are total algebras in which\n0\u22121 = 0. We have used algebras with such zero totalized division in developing elementary\nalgebraic specifications for several algebras of rational numbers in our previous paper [8]\nand its companions [2, 9].\nSeveral generalizations of meadows can be conceived. In [5] signed meadows were\ndefined as a generalization of ordered fields (with totalized division), and in [6] differential\nmeadows are considered which may be viewed as a generalization of differential fields.\nThe generalization of commutative meadows, as defined in [8] and subsequently analyzed in [4], to the non-commutative case is the subject of this paper. As is always the\ncase, the transition from commutative to non-commuutative rings is a delicate operation,\nleading to a ramification of properties. However, we are able isolate a number of concepts\nand prove nice generalizations of basic results, including the following Representation\nTheorem 4.13:\nTheorem An algebra is a non-trivial skew meadow if, and only if, it is isomorphic to\na subalgebra of a product of zero totalized skew fields.\nRing theory has several concepts, like Von Neumann regularity, that distinguish elements\nwith properties similar to multiplicative inverses, but does not seem to have investigated\nthe possible corresponding inverse operators. We establish the relationship between skew\nmeadows and forms of von Neumann regularity conditions on non-commutative rings\n(Theorem 4.14). The equational nature of meadows is confirmed for skew meadows by\nthis result (Theorem 4.15):\nTheorem An equation is valid in all skew fields with zero totalized division if, and only\nif, it is true in the variety of skew meadows and for that reason derivable from their equational axiomatisation.\nInvestigations of fields with zero totalized division have some history in logic and computing: it is mentioned in [12] as a reasonable method to extend division to a total function,\nand it has been used in a more technical way in [11]. This work may be viewed as belonging to universal algebra and equational logic, with some orientation towards computer\nscience, in particular, to the theory of abstract data types. We refer to [17] and [20]\nfor computer science oriented introductions to universal algebra. Of course the paper is\nabout noncommutative rings. We refer to [18] and [15] for introductions to noncommutative rings. To some extent the results are intimately related to the theory of regular and\ninverse semigroups, because many of the arguments can be given without a reference to\naddition and subtraction [16]. We will focus, however, on connections with the theory of\nnoncommutative rings.\n\n2\n\n\f2\n\nAxioms for rings\n\nWe start with a listing of the axioms of a unital ring. The starting point is a signature\n\u03a3RU for rings with unit:\nsignature \u03a3RU\nsorts ring\noperations\n0 : \u2192 ring;\n1 : \u2192 ring;\n+ : ring \u00d7 ring \u2192 ring;\n\u2212 : ring \u2192 ring;\n* : ring \u00d7 ring \u2192 ring\nend\nThe first set of axioms is that of a ring with 1, which establishes the standard properties of +, \u2212, and *.\nequations RU\n(x + y) + z\nx+y\nx+0\nx + (\u2212x)\n(x * y) * z\n1*x\nx * (y + z)\n(x + y) * z\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\nx + (y + z)\ny+x\nx\n0\nx * (y * z)\nx\nx*y+x*z\nx*z+y*z\n\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\n(6)\n(7)\n(8)\n(9)\n(10)\n\nend\nThese axioms generate a wealth of properties of +, \u2212, * with which we will assume the\nreader is familiar. We will write x \u2212 y as an abbreviation of x + (\u2212y). We notice that\nx * 1 = x is not implied by these axioms, whereas x * 0 = 0 and 0 * x = 0 are derivable:\n0 = x * 0 \u2212 x * 0 = x * (0 + 0) \u2212 x * 0 = (x * 0 + x * 0) \u2212 x * 0 = x * 0 + (x * 0 \u2212 x * 0) = x * 0,\nthe other proof is similar.\n\n2.1\n\nSome concepts of ring theory\n\nA ring is commutative if it satisfies :\n\u2200x\u2203y.(x * y = y * x).\nA ring is called von Neumann regular (regular for short) if it satisfies:\n\u2200x\u2203y.(x * y * x = x).\n3\n\n\fAn element y with x * y * x = x is called a pseudoinverse of x. Moreover, an element y\nwith y * x = 1 is called an inverse of x. Indeed every inverse is a pseudoinverse as well.\nFollowing e.g., [14]: a ring is strongly regular if it satisfies:\n\u2200x\u2203y.(x * x * y = x).\nA regular ring is called unit regular if it satisfies:\n\u2200x\u2203y\u2203z.(x * y * x = x & y * z = 1).\nAn idempotent is an element e of a ring that satisfies e * e = e. An element is c is\ncentral if it satisfies \u2200x.(x * c = c * x).\nThere is an equivalent definition of strong regularity that is closer to our objectives:\na ring is strongly regular if it is regular and its idempotents are central.\nAn element x of a ring is nilpotent if some power of it equals 0, i.e.,\n\u2203n.xn = 0.\nA ring is reduced if it has no non-zero nilpotent elements, i.e.,\n\u2200x.(x * x = 0 =\u21d2 x = 0).\nIt is immediate that strongly regular rings are reduced. One can prove as a corollary of\nProposition 4.5 below, that a reduced regular ring is strongly regular.\nIn [1] it is shown (using the first definition) that a strongly regular ring is regular.\nAccording to [19] in a strongly regular ring every idempotent is central. Therefore both\ndefinitions coincide. Below we will need this information, but we will provide complete\nproofs and we will indicate how in an alternative and shorter exposition use could have\nbeen made from this equivalence.\nWe notice that the central elements of a ring constitute a subring. Further, in commutative rings regularity and strong regularity coincide.\n\n2.2\n\nFields and skew fields\n\nA skew field, also called a division ring, is a unital ring that satisifies the general inverse\nlaw (Gil):\n\u2200x 6= 0.\u2203y.(y * x = 1).\nA division ring is a division algebra if it is finitely generated over its centralizer subring.\nThe quaternions as designed by Hamilton constitute a division algebra. A commutative\nskew field is called a field.\nIn skew fields, 1 is a right unit as well as a left unit, and left inverses are also right\ninverses. Every skew field is a strongly regular ring. Indeed consider x, then if x = 0, we\nhave x = x * x * y (for any y) and if x 6= 0 then there is some y with x * y = 1 for which\nof course x = x * x * y. Skew fields are also unit regular rings. Consider again x: if x = 0\nthen x = x * 1 * 1 and 1 * 1 = 1, while with x 6= 0 and y its inverse: x * y * x = x * 1 = 1 and\ny * x = 1.\n4\n\n\f2.3\n\nThe intended meaning of meadows and skew meadows\n\nMeadows and skew meadows are concepts created for the following purpose: meadows are\nsupposed to be models of the equational theory of zero totalized fields and skew meadows\nare supposed to be models of the equational theory of zero totalized skew fields (i.e.,\nskew fields with zero totalized division). Thus, they have an intended meaning that is\nindependent of their axiomatic definition.\nIt is due to Theorem 4.5, that the intended meaning of skew meadows is captured\nby the technical definition that we will provided below. The corresponding fact was\nestablished for meadows in [3].\nThe intended meaning of meadows and skew meadows implies that if one considers\nstructures which violate equations about division true in division algebras these algebras\nwill not be called meadows. A typical example of such an equation is x * x\u22121 = x\u22121 * x. An\nalgebra that fails to comply with this equation cannot be a meadow or a skew meadow.\n\n3\n\nThe signature and axioms of skew meadows\n\nTo the signature \u03a3RU of rings with unit, we add an inverse operator \u22121 to form the primary signature \u03a3M d , which we will use for totalized division rings and meadows:\nsignature \u03a3M d\nimport \u03a3RU\noperations\n\u22121\n: ring \u2192 ring\nend\nAs we insist that all operations are interpreted as total functions x\u22121 must be defined\nfor all x. A division operator which has been made total is called a totalized division\noperator. Fields and skew fields can be enriched to \u03a3M d algebras by extending the signature and defining 0\u22121 = a for some appropriate a. A (skew) field thus obtained is called\na-totalized. In the sequel we will only consider the case a = 0 and work with zero totalized\nfields and skew fields.\nA skew meadow is a \u03a3RU algebra which satisfies RU and in addition these two equations:\nequations SkMd\nimport RU, \u03a3M d\n(x\u22121 )\u22121 = x\nx * (x * x\u22121 ) = x\n\n(11)\n(12)\n\nend\nAxiom 11 is called Ref for reflection. Axiom 12 is called Ril for restricted inverse law.\nTogether these axioms imply 0\u22121 = 0 because 0\u22121 = 0\u22121 * 0\u22121 * (0\u22121 )\u22121 = 0\u22121 * 0\u22121 * 0 = 0.\n5\n\n\fA meadow is a commutative skew meadow. In terms of axioms, the equations for skew\nmeadows result from the equations for meadows, by simply dropping commutativity of\nmultiplication and including a second distributivity law; this is the same modification\nthat is needed to move from unital commutative rings to arbitrary rings with a left unit.\nA zero totalized field is a meadow and a zero totalized skew field is a skew meadow.\nJust as meadows capture the equational theory of fields with zero totalized division, in\na similar fashion, skew meadows have been designed to capture the equational theory of\nskew fields with zero totalized division.\nA skew meadow is (an enrichment of) a strongly regular ring. A meadow is an enrichment of a commutative regular ring (which must be strongly regular as well). In [3] it\nwas shown that every commutative regular ring can be expanded with an inverse operator\nto a meadow. Below, in Proposition 4.14, we will find that in the noncommutative case\nevery strongly regular ring can be expanded to a skew meadow.\nThe non-commutative case makes distinctions between axioms that are useful equivalents in the commutative case. For example, the equation\n\u2200x.(x * x\u22121 * x = x)\nis called Pil and cannot be assumed to be equivalent with Ril .\n\n3.1\n\nMultiplicative semigroups\n\nForgetting 0, + and - a meadow restricts to an inverse semigroup, which is a special\ncase of regular semigroups. Thus a meadow combines a commutative ring and an inverse\nsemigroup and a skew meadow combines a possibly noncommutative ring with an inverse\nsemigroup. The theory of inverse semigroups provides information about the existence\nof an inverse operation in regular semigroups. From that perspective the information in\nour Propositions 4.9 and 4.14 below that strongly regular rings can be uniquely equipped\nwith an inverse operator that satisfies both laws is known as a result in semigroup theory.\nWe have included the results and proofs for completeness of our exposition.\nInverse semigroups have been introduced to formalize properties of function spaces.\nMore specifically, inverse semigroups are to partial symmetries what groups are to symmetries [16]. We have not found evidence that inverse semigroups have been used to\nformalize totalized division in the mathematical literature.\n\n4\n\nTheory of skew meadows\n\nIn this section we provide a number of logical and structural results concerning skew\nmeadows. We start with some preparations.\n\n4.1\n\nAuxiliary operators\n\nWhen working with meadows we will frequently use some auxiliary notation in order to\nimprove readability or conciseness. We formalize the use of these inessential notations by\nincluding them in an extended specification Aux. Of course, these operators can always\n6\n\n\fbe removed from any specification or proof in favor of their explicit definitions.\nsignature \u03a3Aux\nsorts ring\noperations\n\u22122 : ring \u2192 ring;\n\u2212 : ring \u2192 ring;\n1\u2212 : ring \u00d7 ring \u2192 ring;\nZ : ring \u2192 ring;\n\u2212\n: ring \u00d7 ring \u2192 ring\n\u2212\nend\n\nequations Aux\nimport \u03a3M d , \u03a3Aux\nx2\nx\n1x\nZ(x)\nx\ny\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\nx*x\nx\u22121\nx*x\n1 \u2212 1x\n\n= x*y\n\n(13)\n(14)\n(15)\n(16)\n(17)\n\nend\n\n4.2\n\nSome properties of skew meadows\n\nIn this section we will state and prove a number of useful facts valid in the variety of skew\nmeadows.\nProposition 4.1. x * x = 0 \u2192 x = 0.\nProof. If x * x = 0 then also x * x * x\u22121 = 0 * x\u22121 = 0. Now using Ril one obtains x = 0.\nProposition 4.2. x\u22121 * x\u22121 * x = x\u22121 .\nProof. Combine Ril and Ref .\nProposition 4.3. x * y = 1 \u2192 x = y \u22121.\nProof. Assume x * y = 1, then 1 = x * y = x * y * y * y \u22121 = 1 * y * y \u22121 = y * y \u22121. Therefore\nx = x * 1 = x * (y * y \u22121 ) = (x * y) * y \u22121 = 1 * y \u22121 = y \u22121.\nAn obvious and useful consequence of this proposition is 1\u22121 = 1.\nProposition 4.4. x * x\u22121 is an idempotent: (x * x\u22121 )(x * x\u22121 ) = x * x\u22121 .\n7\n\n\fProof. We have: x * x\u22121 = (x * x * x\u22121 ) * x\u22121 and therefore (x * x\u22121 )2 = (x * x * x\u22121 * x\u22121 )2 =\nx * x * (x\u22121 * x\u22121 * x) * x * x\u22121 * x\u22121 = (x * x * x\u22121 ) * x * x\u22121 * x\u22121 = (x * x * x\u22121 ) * x\u22121 = x * x\u22121 .\nProposition 4.5. (i) \u2200x.(x * 1 = x);\n(ii) \u2200x.(x * x\u22121 * x = x) (i.e., Pil ); and,\n(iii) every idempotent is central: if e * e = e then \u2200x(e * x = x * e).\nProof. This proof uses the following idea taken from [10] (chapter 3). For every y and\nevery idempotent e we have: [e * y * (1 \u2212 e)]2 = 0 as (1 \u2212 e) * e = 0, and for the same reason\nalso [(1 \u2212 e) * y * e]2 = 0. Therefore we have e * y * (1 \u2212 e) = 0 and (1 \u2212 e) * y * e = 0.\nUsing distributivity we find e * y * 1 \u2212 e * y * e = 0 and 1 * y * e \u2212 e * y * e = 0. Combining\nthese two equations we have: e * y * 1 = 1 * y * e and then e * y * 1 = y * e.\nIn particular with e = y * y \u22121 we have y * y \u22121 * y * 1 = y * y * y \u22121, and using Ril we find\ny*y \u22121 *y*1 = y. Right-multiplying both sides with y*y \u22121 we have y*y \u22121 *y*1*y*y \u22121 = y*y*y \u22121\nand then y * y \u22121 * y * (1 * y * y \u22121 ) = y. Now using RU we have y * y \u22121 * y * (y * y \u22121 ) = y\nwhich can be written as y * y \u22121 * (y * y * y \u22121 ) = y. Now Ril gives y * y \u22121 * y = y (i.e., Pil ).\nCombining this fact with the equation y * y \u22121 * y * 1 = y * y * y \u22121 that was established above\none finds y * 1 = y for arbitrary y. Now using the equation e * y * 1 = y * e which has already\nbeen established, we have e * y = y * e as desired.\nThis proof makes use only of the fact that the meadow is reduced. An alternative\n(and shorter) proof using the literature cited in Section 2.1 is as follows: the meadow is\na strongly regular ring which must therefore be regular (which proves Pil ) and moreover\nits idempotents are central. Because 1 is an idempotent it is central and therefore x * 1 =\n1 * x = x.\nProposition 4.6. x * x\u22121 = x\u22121 * x.\nProof. x * x\u22121 = x * (x\u22121 * x\u22121 * x) = (x * x\u22121 * x\u22121 ) * x = [(x * x\u22121 ) * x\u22121 ] * x =\n[x\u22121 * (x * x\u22121 )] * x = x\u22121 * x.\nCorollary 4.7. Every skew meadow is a Dedekind finite ring, i.e., it satisfies:\nx * y = 1 \u2192 y * x = 1.\nProof. If x * y = 1 then y = x\u22121 and thus y * x = x\u22121 * x = x * x\u22121 = x * y = 1.\nProposition 4.8. Skew meadows are expansions of unit regular rings.\nProof. Given x, if 1x = 1 then x\u22121 is a unit. Otherwise, let y = (1 \u2212 1x ) + x\u22121 and\ny \u2032 = (1\u22121x )+x. Now x*y*x = x*1*x\u2212x*1x *x+x*x\u22121 *x = x*x\u2212x*x+x = x and moreover:\ny *y \u2032 = [(1\u22121x )+x\u22121 ]*[(1\u22121x )+x] = (1\u22121x )*(1\u22121x )+(1\u22121x )*x+x\u22121 *(1\u22121x )+x\u22121 *x =\n1\u22121x \u22121x +1x *1x +x\u22121x *x+x\u22121 \u2212x\u22121 *1x +x\u22121 *x = 1\u22121x \u22121x +1x +x\u2212x+x\u22121 \u2212x\u22121 +1x =\n1.\nProposition 4.9. The inverse function is uniquely determined in a strong sense: For a\ngiven x if there is some y such that: (x * y * x = x or x * x * y = x) and (y * x * y = y or\ny * y * x = y), then y = x\u22121 .\n\n8\n\n\fProof. If x * y * x = x then x * y is idempotent so that x * x * y = x also holds. The same\nholds for y * x * y = y. Therefore we have in any case that x * x * y = x and yyx = y.\nWe denote e = x * x\u22121 and make use the fact that it is an idempotent and that it\ncommutes with every element, that it is equal to x\u22121 x, and that x = ex:\ny = y * y * x = y * y * (e * e * e * x) = e * e * y * e * y * x = x\u22121 * x\u22121 * x * x * y * e * y * x =\nx\u22121 * x\u22121 * x* e* y * x = x\u22121 * x\u22121 * x\u22121 * x* x* y * x = x\u22121 * x\u22121 * x\u22121 * x* x = x\u22121 * x\u22121 * x = x\u22121 .\nProposition 4.10. (i) x * 1x = x = 1x * x\n(ii) 1x*y * 1x * 1y = 1x*y\n(iii) 1x * 1y = x * y * y * x\n(iv) x * y = y * x.\nProof. (i) is just Ril , (and for the second equality Pil ).\n(ii)1x*y * 1x * 1y = x * y * x * y * 1x * 1y = x * 1x * y * 1y * x * y = x * y * x * y = 1x*y .\n(iii) immediate.\n(iv) x * y = x * y*x * y*x*y = x * y 2 *x*x*x*y*1y = x * y 2 *x*1y *x*x*y = x * y 2 *x*y*y*x*x*y =\nx * y * y * x* x* y = x * y * y * x* 1x * x* y * 1y = x * y * 1x * 1y * y * x* x* y = x * y * x* y * y * x* y * x* x* y =\nx * y*x*y*y*x*y*1x *y = x * y*x*y*1x *y*x*y*y = x * y*(x*y)*1x *y*x*1y = x * y*(x*y)*1x *1y *y*x =\nx * y * (x * y)2 * y * x * y * x = x * y * y * x * y * x = 1x * 1y * y * x = 1x * y * x = y * 1x * x = y * x.\nProposition 4.11. 1x*y = 1y*x .\nProof. 1x*y = x * y * x * y = x * y * y * x = x * 1y * x = x * x * 1y = 1x * 1y = 1y * 1x = 1y*x .\nCorollary 4.12. Every skew meadow satisfies:\nx * y = 0 \u2192 y * x = 0.\nProof. If x*y = 0 then y *x = y *x*1y*x = y *x*1x*y = y *x*x*y *x * y = y *x*0*x * y = 0.\n\n4.3\n\nEmbedding theorem and completeness results\n\nBecause the axioms for meadows are equations, and as they hold in all skew fields, all\nsubalgebras of products of skew fields are skew meadows. Generalizing the results obtained\nin [3] to the noncommutative case, we show the converse:\nTheorem 4.13. Every non-trivial skew meadow is isomorphic to a \u03a3M d substructure of\na product of zero totalized skew fields.\nProof. The plan of the proof is as follows. Let R be a skew meadow in which 0 and 1\nare different. For every element x 6= 0 there is a homomorphism (with respect to all\nthe operations, including the inverse) of the structure R into a zero totalized skew field\nRx , which takes x away from 0. These homomorphisms can then be combined into a\nmonomorphism of R into the product of the skew fields Rx fo all non-zero x.\nThe proof is done in three steps: given an element x \u2208 R we do the following:\n1. Define a ring homomorphism h from R onto the ring ex * R with its new unit 1x ,\nand show that x is mapped to an invertible element.\n2. Prove that a skew meadow modulo a maximal ideal is a ring with division. If p is\nthe projection of the skew meadow 1x * R onto this ring with division then p * h is a ring\nhomomorphism onto a skew field that maps x away from 0.\n9\n\n\f3. We conclude the proof by showing that a ring homomorphism from the reduct\nof a skew meadow into a skew field is a meadow homomorphism when the inverse is\nappropriately defined on the skew field.\nFrom now on an ideal in a ring will mean a two sided (left and right) ideal.\nStep 1 : Because 1x is an idempotent in the meadow R it is central, and for that reason\n1x * R is a (two sided) ideal, 1x is a unit in this ideal, x and x\u22121 are in this ideal, inverse\nto each other, and h(z) = 1x * z is a ring homomorphism. In 1x * R the interpretation of\ninverse as the mapping of 1x * z to ex * z \u22121 makes the ring 1x * R into a meadow. The proof\nis easy, using the axioms of a skew meadow and the properties in the propositions above.\nStep 2 : Let S be a skew meadow and J a maximal (two sided) ideal. Then S/J is a\ndivision ring, and (trivially) every invertible element of S has a non zero image.\nJ is a maximal ideal. Assume that x is not in J and look at the subset J + 1x * S,\nwhich is also a (two sided ideal). Therefore it is all of S, and for some r \u2208 S and j \u2208 J we\nhave j + 1x * r = 1. Since 1x = x * x\u22121 (and also x\u22121 * x) we conclude that in the quotient\n[x] * [x\u22121 * r] = [1]. Therefore every non zero element in S/J has an inverse.\nStep 3 : If H is a ring homomorphism from a skew meadow into a skew field then H\npreserves also inverses. Therefore it is a meadow homomorphism.\nIf H(x) = 0 then H(1x ) = H(x * x\u22121 ) = H(x) * H(x\u22121 ) = 0 so that also H(x\u22121 ) =\nH(1x * x\u22121 ) = H(1x ) * H(x\u22121 ) = 0 = (H(x))\u22121 . We assume therefore that H(x) 6= 0.\nThen H(x) = H(1x * x) = H(1x ) * H(x) which proves that H(1x ) = 1, by cancellation\nin skew fields. In other words 1 = H(x * x\u22121 ) = H(x) * H(x\u22121 ), which proves that\nH(x\u22121 ) = (H(x))\u22121 .\n\n4.4\n\nStrongly regular rings can be turned into meadows\n\nBy Proposition 4.5 every skew meadow is an expansion of a strongly regular ring. Our\nnext observation is the converse: In every strongly regular ring there is a unique way to\nchoose for each element one of its inverse elements and define an inverse function which\nis also reflexive:\nTheorem 4.14. If R is a strongly regular ring then there is an inverse function (necessarily unique by Proposition 4.9) that turns it into a skew meadow.\nProof. We will show first that for all the elements y that are pseudo inverse to x, i.e.,\nxyx = x the idempotent xy is the same element and the element xyx is the same element.\nWe wil then show that with the definition x\u22121 = yxy we obtain a skew meadow. We\nproceed in four steps.\na) If y and y \u2032 are pseudoinverses of x then x * y = x * y \u2032 . Indeed, first notice that x * y\nis idempotent: (x * y) * (x * y) = (x * y * x) * y = x * y. Then we calculate as follows:\nx * y \u2032 = (x * y * x) * y \u2032 = (x * y) * (x * y \u2032 ) = (x * y \u2032 ) * (x * y) = (x * y \u2032 * x) * y = x * y.\nIf y is a pseudo inverse of x then we call the product x * y (which is independent of\nthe choice of y) the local unit of x, and we denote it by 1lx . Trivially 1lx * x = x * 1lx and\neasily 1lx * 1lx = 1lx .\n10\n\n\fb) For every pseudo inverse y of x, 1lx * y is also a pseudo inverse of x. Indeed:\nx * (1lx * y) * x = (x * 1lx ) * y * x = x * y * x = x. Moreover, for every pseudo inverse y\nthe product 1lx * y yields the same pseudo inverse element. First notice that for a pseudo\ninverse y of y * x is an idempotent: (y * x) * (y * x) = y * (x * y * x) = y * x. Suppose that u,\ny and y \u2032 are pseudo inverses of x then 1lx * y = (x * u) * y = y * (x * u) = y * (x * y \u2032 * x) * u =\n(y * x) * (y \u2032 * x) * u = (y \u2032 * x) * (y * x) * u = y \u2032 * (x * y * x) * u = y \u2032 * (x * u) = (x * u) * y \u2032 = 1x * y.\nLet y be any pseudo inverse for x we define x\u22121 as follows: x\u22121 = 1lx * y. It has just\nbeen demonstrated that this definition is independent from the choice of y. With y a\npseudo inverse for x we find 1x = x * x\u22121 = x * 1lx * y = x * (x * y) * y = (x * y) * x * y = x * y = 1lx .\nc) By (b) x\u22121 is a pseudo inverse of x, and for all pseudo inverses y we have 1x *y = x\u22121\ntherefore: 1x * x\u22121 = x\u22121 . Moreover we know that x\u22121 * (x\u22121 )\u22121 is and idempotent. We\nuse this to show that 1x = 1x\u22121 as follows: 1x\u22121 = x\u22121 * (x\u22121 )\u22121 = 1x * x\u22121 * (x\u22121 )\u22121 =\nx * x\u22121 * (x\u22121 * (x\u22121 )\u22121 ) = x * (x\u22121 * (x\u22121 )\u22121 ) * x\u22121 = x * (x\u22121 * (x\u22121 )\u22121 * x\u22121 ) = x * x\u22121 = 1x .\nd) After these preparations we can show that this inverse operation turns the ring\ninto a skew meadow. Ril is trivial since x\u22121 is a pseudo inverse of x, and it remains to\nshow that Ref also holds and therefore (x\u22121 )\u22121 = x. Indeed: (x\u22121 )\u22121 = (x\u22121 )\u22121 * 1x\u22121 =\n(x\u22121 )\u22121 * 1x = (x\u22121 )\u22121 * x\u22121 * x = 1x\u22121 * x = 1x * x = x.\n\n4.5\n\nA completeness result\n\nAs in [3], a completeness result follows from the embedding theorem.\nTheorem 4.15. Every equation valid in all skew fields with zero totalized division is true\nin the variety of skew meadows and for that reason derivable from SkMd.\nProof. A trivial skew meadow satisfies all equations and for that reason all equations valid\nin all skew fields. Now consider a non-trivial skew meadow. According to Theorem 4.13\nit is embedded in a subalgebra of a product of skew fields. Now equations true of all skew\nfields are true in products of skew fields and in all subalgebras of such products including\nthe given non-trivial skew meadow.\nAnother interesting consequence of the embedding theorem is that a non-trivial skew\nmeadow must be infinite. According to Wedderburn's Small Theorem, non-commutative\nskew fields must have characteristic 0. A product of algebras with characteristic 0 has\ncharacteristic 0 as well, which implies that its minimal subalgebra is infinite.\n\n5\n\nInversion rings\n\nInversion rings are like skew meadows but without the restriction that idempotents are\ncentral. Because idempotents are central in all skew fields, inversion rings with non-central\nidempotents will not be referred to as meadows. The ring that underlies an inversion ring\nmust be regular but need not be strongly regular.\nBecause strong regularity is implied by the axioms for skew meadows some weakening\nof the axioms needs to take place. Instead of Ril we will use a (potentially) weaker axiom\n11\n\n\fwhich we have called Pil for pseudo inverse law. In Proposition 4.5 it was noticed that\nskew meadows satisfy Pil . The connection between the various notions is now as follows:\nskew meadows are inversion rings with central idempotents and meadows are commutative\nskew meadows.\nThe phrase inversion ring can be easily adapted to fields as follows: an inversion field\nis a zero totalized field and a skew inversion field is a zero totalized skew field. We notice\nthat an inversion skew field is an inversion ring in which all idempotents are central and\nwhere the only idempotents are 0 and 1.\nA generalization of an inversion skew field arises as follows: a semi-inversion skew\nfield is an inversion skew field in which the only central idempotents are 0 and 1. This\ndefinition gives rise to the question: Can the embedding theorem and the completeness\ntheorem be generalized to semi-inversion skew fields. Stated in other words: Is the equational theory of semi-inversion skew fields finitely based?\n\n5.1\n\nAxioms for inversion rings\n\nThese axioms are weaker than the axioms for skew meadows.\nequations IR\nimport RU, \u03a3M d\nx*1\n(\u2212x)\u22121\n(x\u22121 )\u22121\nx * (x\u22121 * x)\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\nx\n\u2212(x\u22121 )\nx\nx\n\n(18)\n(19)\n(20)\n(21)\n\nend\nAn inversion ring is a model of IR. It is immediate that x * x\u22121 is an idempotent in\nan inversion ring. It is also the case that 0\u22121 = 0 in any inversion ring. We have included\n(\u2212x)\u22121 = \u2212(x\u22121 ) because this equation expresses a very important symmetry. It is easily\nderivable from the axioms of skew meadows. Currently we have no proof that it is not\nderivable from the other axioms of inversion rings. The same holds for x * 1 = x.\n\n5.2\n\nPseudo-commutative inversion rings\n\nAn inversion ring is pseudo-commutative if it satisfies: \u2200x\u2200y.[(x * y)\u22121 = y \u22121 * x\u22121 ]. After removing a redundant axiom one obtains the following axiomatization of pseudocommutative inversion rings.\nequations PCIR, \u03a3M d\n\n12\n\n\fimport RU\n(x * y)\u22121 = y \u22121 * x\u22121\n(x\u22121 )\u22121 = x\nx * (x\u22121 * x) = x\n\n(22)\n(23)\n(24)\n\nend\nA ring will be called distinctly regular if its satisfies the following property:\n\u2200x\u2203!y.(x * y * x = x & y * x * y = y).\nIt is immediate that x * x = x \u2192 x = x\u22121 in any distinctly regular ring. Strongly regular\nrings are distinctly regular as a corollary to Proposition 4.14. The importance of distinct\nregularity for inversion rings is implied by the next Proposition.\nProposition 5.1. A distinctly regular ring can be expanded to an inversion ring.\nProof. Obviously on defines x\u22121 as the unique y such that x * y * x = x and y * x * y = y.\nRil is immediately satisfied. We will prove the other two axioms. Consider u = x\u22121 * 1.\nNow x * u * x = x * x\u22121 * (1 * x) = x * x\u22121 * x = x and u * x * u = x\u22121 * (1 * x) * x\u22121 * 1 =\nx\u22121 * x * x\u22121 * 1 = x\u22121 * 1 = u. Thus u = x\u22121 for all x. Now substituting x\u22121 for x we find\nx = (x\u22121 )\u22121 = u\u22121 = u\u22121 * 1 = (x\u22121 )\u22121 * 1 = x * 1.\nNext consider u = (\u2212x)\u22121 . We have (\u2212x) * u * (\u2212x) = \u2212x and u * (\u2212x) * u = u from\nthis we find x * (\u2212u) * x = x and \u2212u * x * \u2212u = \u2212u. Distinct regularity implies \u2212u = x\u22121\nwhich implies u = \u2212x\u22121 which is the required fact.\nWe notice that it follows from distinct regularity that the expansion is unique.\nProposition 5.2. A regular ring in which all idempotents commute is distinctly regular.\nProof. The result and its proof are valid in semigroups but we phrase both in terms of\nrings. let R be a regular ring in which idempotents commute. Then every element of\nS has at least one inverse. Suppose that a in S has two pseudoinverses b and c, i.e.,\na * b * a = a, b * a * b = b, a * c * a = a and c * a * c = c. Then a * b, a * c. b * a and c * a are\nidempotents as immediate consequences of these assumptions.\nNow b = b * a * b = b * (a * c * a) * b = b * a * c * (a * c) * (a * b) = b * a * c * (a * b) * (a * c) =\n(c * a) * (b * a) * b * a * c = c * a * b * a * c = c * a * c = c.\nProposition 5.3. In a distinctly regular all idempotents commute.\nProof. This result is known in semigroup theory (see [13] Thm. 5.1.1) but we include a\nproof to make the paper self contained.\nWe assume that for every element x in the ring there is a unique y such that x*y *x = y\nand y * x * y = x. This y is called the inverse of x and is denoted by x\u22121 . We notice that:\n1. If y = x\u22121 then x = y \u22121, since the same pair of equations testify to both.\n2. If e is an idempotent then e\u22121 = e, since e = e * e * e is the only condition involved.\n13\n\n\fClaim 1: Let e be an idempotent. If e * x = x then x\u22121 * e = x\u22121 . If x * e = x then\ne * x\u22121 = x\u22121 .\nProof: x * (x\u22121 * e) * x = x * x\u22121 * (e * x) = x * x\u22121 * x = x. On the other hand\nx\u22121 * e * x * x\u22121 * e = [x\u22121 * (e * x) * x\u22121 ] * e = [x\u22121 * x * x\u22121 ] * e = x\u22121 * e. Therefore x\u22121 * e is\ninverse to x and by uniqueness it equals x\u22121 . The other direction is similar.\nClaim 2: If e and f are idempotents then so is also e * f .\nProof: Let I = (e * f )\u22121 . We have e * e * f = e * f so that I * e = I, by lemma 1.\nSimilarly f * I = I. Therefore I = I * e * f * I = (I * e) * (f * I) = I * I. Hence I is idempotent\nso that I = I \u22121 = e * f and in particular e * f is idempotent.\nNow we can prove that any two idempotents commute. Let e and f be idempotents.\nThen e * f is an idempotent and (e * f )\u22121 = e * f . We show that *e is also inverse to e * f so\nthat e*f = f *e by the uniqueness of inverse. Indeed (e*f )*(f *e)*(e*f ) = e*(*f )*(e*e)*f =\ne * f * e * f = e * f , as e f and e * f are idempotents. Similarly (f * e) * (e * f ) * (f * e) = f * e.\nProposition 5.4. A regular ring with commuting idempotents can be expanded to a\npseudo-commutative inversion ring.\nProof. Consider elements x and y. We have x*y *(y \u22121 *x\u22121 )*x*y = x*(y *y \u22121)*(x\u22121 *x)*y =\nx*(x\u22121 *x)*(y *y \u22121)*y = x*y and similarly (y \u22121 *x\u22121 )*x*y *(y \u22121 *x\u22121 ) = y \u22121 *x\u22121 . In view of\nProposition 5.2 the ring is distinctly regular and we can infer that (x*y)\u22121 = y \u22121 *x\u22121 .\nProposition 5.5. In a pseudo-commutative inversion ring where all idempotents e satisfy\ne = e\u22121 products of idempotents are idempotent.\nProof. Consider idempotents e and f . We have e*f = e*f *(e*f )\u22121 *e*f = e*f *f \u22121 *e\u22121 *e*f =\ne * f * f * e * e * f = e * f * e * f.\nProposition 5.6. A distinctly regular inversion ring is pseudo-commutative.\nProof. Using Proposition 5.3 the ring has commuting idempotents. Now using 5.4 it must\nbe pseudo-commutative as the expansion with an inverse operator must be unique.\nSeveral questions remain unanswered: Is there a finite equational specification of the\nclass of directly regular inversion rings? Is there a finite equational specification of the\nclass of regular inversion rings in which all idempotents are equal to their own inverse?\n\n5.3\n\nInversion compatible rings\n\nWe call a ring inversion compatible if it can be expanded with an inverse operator into\nan inversion ring. Proposition 5.1 implies that distinctly regular rings are inversion compatible. Obviously every inversion ring is an expansion of a regular ring. Trivially every\ninversion compatible ring can be expanded to an inversion ring. We have not been able\nto answer the following question: Are all regular rings inversion compatible? We expect\nthis not to be the case.\n14\n\n\fWe will now examine a particular example in meticulous detail. It proves the existence\nof a non strongly regular and non-pseudo-commutative inversion ring. It can be concluded\nthat the replacement of Ril by Pil constitutes a weakening of the axioms.\nWe have not yet developed any structure theory for non-central inversion rings. All\ntechnical work on skew meadows depends on centrality and non-central inversion rings\nhave to be investigated from scratch.\n\n5.4\n\nMatrix rings over a field of characteristic different from 2\n\nThe 2\u00d72 matrices over zero-totalized rational numbers M2 (Q0 ) constitute a non-commutative\nring. Although familiar to all mathematicians we will spell out the details of this matter\nbecause of the importance of this example. A matrix X has the form\n\u0013\n\u0012\nx11 x12\n.\nX=\nx21 x22\nLet, in addition to X, the matrix Y be given by:\n\u0013\n\u0012\ny11 y12\n.\nY =\ny21 y22\nThen we have the two constants for unital rings:\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n1 0\n0 0\n,1=\n0=\n0 1\n0 0\nand operators\n\u2212X =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2212x11 \u2212x12\n\u2212x21 \u2212x22\n\nand\nX *Y =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n, X +Y =\n\n\u0012\n\nx11 + y11 x12 + y12\nx21 + y21 x21 + y22\n\nx11 * y11 + x12 * y21 x11 * y12 + x12 * y22\nx21 * y11 + x22 * y21 x21 * y12 + x22 * y22\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0013\n\nAn important observation is that\n\u0013\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0012\n0 0\n0 0\n0 0\n.\n=\n*\n0 0\n1 0\n1 0\nClearly x * x = 0 \u2192 x = 0 fails in matrix rings. Because Ril implies x * x = 0 \u2192 x = 0,\nirrespectively of how an inverse is defined no expansion of the matrix ring to a skew\nmeadow is possible. There might however be an expansion possible to a very skew meadow.\nIt will now be established that this is indeed the case.\n\n5.5\n\nExpanding the matrix ring with an inverse operator\n\nThe matrix X is called regular if Det(X) = x11 * x22 \u2212 x12 * x21 6= 0. We abbreviate\nD = Det(X) and if X is regular it is invertible and an explicit formula for the inverse\nexists:\n\u0012\n\u0013\nX \u22121 =\n\nx22\nD\n\u2212x21\nD\n\n15\n\n\u2212x12\nD\nx11\nD\n\n.\n\n\fIn this case we have: (X \u22121 )\u22121 = X, X * X \u22121 = X \u22121 * X = 1 and for that reason also Pil :\nX * (X \u22121 * X) = X.\nWe will now define a suitable inverse in all other cases as well. Nonregular matrices\nmay have either four zeros (the case X = 0), three zeros (which splits in four cases), two\nzeros (either in the same column or in the same row), or no zeros at all and the second\ncolumn equal to a scalar product of the first column. Together these are seven cases which\ncan be dealt with (almost) independently. In the case of four zeros we take 0\u22121 = 0 which\nclearly satisfies both Ref and Pil . In the case of three zeros we have x 6= 0 and the two\ndiagonal cases:\n\u0012\n\u0013\u22121 \u0012 \u22121\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\u22121 \u0012\n\u0013\nx 0\nx\n0\n0 0\n0 0\n=\n,\n=\n0 0\n0 0\n0 x\n0 x\u22121\nIn these cases Ril and Pil are immediate and moreover X *X \u22121 = X \u22121 *X.

Indeed\nconsider the element\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 0\n.\nP =\n1 0\nP is an idempotent but its inverse is not. In a pseudo-commutative inversion ring inverses\nof idempotents must be idempotent as well: e\u22121 = (e * e)\u22121 = e\u22121 * e\u22121 .\nWe have yet to find an example of a pseudo-commutative inversion ring which is not\na skew meadow.\n\n5.6\n\nRegular and inverse semigroups\n\nAs we have stated already in Section 3.1 a skew meadow can be restricted by forgetting\naddition and subtraction, thus obtaining a semigroup. Regular semigroups are defined as\nsemigroups which satisfy: \u2200x\u2203y.(x*y*x = x). Clearly every inversion ring is an enrichment\nof a regular semigroup.\n17\n\n\fA more resticted class of semigroups consists of the inverse semigroups. An inverse\nsemigroup is a semigroup that satisfies:\n\u2200x\u2203!y.(x * y * x = x & y * x * y = y)\nHere \u2203!y.\u03c6 asserts the existence of a unique y such that \u03c6. Clearly each inverse semigroup\nis regular. From Proposition 4.14 we find that strongly regular rings are enrichments (by\n0, + and -) of inverse semigroups. Thus any skew meadow is a combination of a reduced\nring and an inverse semigroup (and conversely).\nIf a ring is an enrichment of an inverse semigroup it is obviously inverse compatible.\nWe don't know whether or not the converse is true.\nOf course inversion compatibility can be viewed as a property of semigroups rather\nthan as a property of rings. All inverse semigroups are inversion compatible, but the\nconverse fails. Now a regular ring is inversion compatible precisely if its multiplicative\nsemigroup is inversion compatible.\nInversion compatibility for regular semigroups is probably a more easily accessible\ntopic than inversion compatibility for regular rings.\n\n6\n\nSpecification of three zero totalized division rings\n\nIn this section thee algebraic specifications will be proposed each extending the specification of skew meadows.\n\n6.1\n\nRational numbers\n\nThe rational number specification from [8] can be weakened and commutativity is not\nessential because 1x is central in any skew meadow, and that restricted form of commutativity satisfies to prove the initiality result. We refer to [7, 8] for the definitions of initial\nalgebra specifications and initial algebra semantics.\nequations Zero totalized rationals\nimport SkMd, Aux\nZ(1 + x2 + y 2 + z 2 + u2 ) = 0\n\n(25)\n\nend\nWe will not repeat the argument of [8] proving that an initial algebra specification of\nzero totalized rationals is obtained. Some comments are in order, however. The main\nthrust of the proof is to demonstrate that each closed term t is provably equal to a\nterm in a set of canonical forms called the transversal. The transversal consists of 0,\nand k * (l)\u22121 , \u2212k * (l)\u22121 for k and l relatively prime positive natural numbers and with\nn denoting the numeral for n, i.e., the sum of n 1's. The proof use induction on the\nstructure of t. We will only consider the cases t = r * s and t = r + s and ignore negations\nsigns to simplify notation. Suppose that r = k * (l)\u22121 and s = m * (n)\u22121 . As n and m are\n18\n\n\fsums of four squares plus 1 it can be shown that l * (l)\u22121 = n * (n)\u22121 = 1. Further it is\neasy to prove that for all m and n, m * n = m.n.\nNow r + s = k * (l)\u22121 + m * (n)\u22121 = k * 1 * (l)\u22121 + m * 1 * (n)\u22121 = k * n * (n)\u22121 * (l)\u22121 +\nm * l * (l)\u22121 * (n)\u22121 = k * n * (l * n)\u22121 + m * l * (n * l)\u22121 = k.n * (l.n)\u22121 + m.l * (n.l)\u22121 =\nk.n + m.l * (n.l)\u22121 = p\u2032 .p * (p\u2032\u2032 .p)\u22121 = p\u2032 * p * (p)\u22121 * (p\u2032\u2032 )\u22121 = p\u2032 * 1 * (p\u2032\u2032 )\u22121 = p\u2032 * (p\u2032\u2032 )\u22121 . Here\nk.n + m.l = p\u2032 .p and n.l = p\u2032\u2032 .p with p the GCD of k.n + m.l and l.n.\nNext we will consider t = r*s. With induction on n one derives that for all n: n*x = x*n\n(i.e., all numerals are central in the initial algebra). Now r * s = k * (l)\u22121 * m * (n)\u22121 =\nk * m * (l)\u22121 * (n)\u22121 , and for terms of this form the previous part of the proof has already\nestablished a path towards the canonical form.\nOne may wonder whether a simpler specification is possible for instance by using\nthe equation Z(1 + x2 ) = 0 instead. Now this will not work because the prime field of\ncharacteristic 3 satisfies Z(1+x2 ) = 0 but fails to be a homomorphic image of the meadow\nof rational numbers which is immediate by considering the image of 1 = (1 + 1 + 1)/(1 +\n1 + 1) which must equal 0 and 1 simultaneously. (At the time of writing we do not know\nwhether or the equation Z(1 + x2 + y 2) = 0 suffices to specify the rational numbers in\nthis context).\n\n6.2\n\nComplex rational numbers\n\nAs an exercise we specify the zero totalized complex rationals. This specification is an\nadaptation of the specification presented in [8]. c() is the complex conjugate. It serves\nas a unary auxiliary function. Just like the rationals the zero totalized complex rationals\nconstitute a commutative meadow while the required amount of commutativity follows\nfrom the axioms for skew meadows already. The adaptation of the proof follows the same\nlines as in the case of the rational numbers.\nequations Zero totalized complex rationals\nimport SkMd, Aux\noperations\ni : \u2192 ring;\nc : ring \u2192 ring;\ni2\nc(i)\nc(x\u22121 )\nc(x + y)\nc(x * y)\n1c(x)\nZ(1 + x * c(x) + y * c(y))\nend\n\n19\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\n\u22121\n\u2212i\nc(x)\u22121\nc(x) + c(y)\nc(x) * c(y)\n1x\n0\n\n(26)\n(27)\n(28)\n(29)\n(30)\n(31)\n(32)\n\n\fThe specification makes use of c() as an auxiliary operator. This specification suggests\nan obvious question which was first mentioned in [9]: can a specification of the zero\ntotalized complex rational numbers be given that makes no use of any auxiliary function.\n\n6.3\n\nZero totalized rational quaternions\n\nThe quaternions are a well-known skew field. The rational quaternions constitute its prime\nsub(skew)field. Its expansion to a skew meadow constitutes the zero totalized quaternions.\nThis is a computable algebra. According to [7] every computable data type has an initial\nalgebra specification which may make use of auxiliary functions. Here we will make use\nof a unary auxiliary function c. As it turns out many algebras can be specified by means\nof an initial algebra specification using a only single unary auxiliary function. We are not\naware of any theoretical results that indicate why this is the case and for what kind of\nalgebras a the use single unary auxiliary function will not be sufficient for giving an initial\nalgebra specification.\nThe auxiliary function c(\u2212) is the conjugate for quaternions. It is a division ring\n(pseudo) homomorphism which sends i, j, k to -i, -j and -k respectively.\nThe following set of equations, together with the axioms on inverse and the equations\nfor rings, specifiy the skew field of rational quaternions with zero totalized division as its\ninitial algebra. Interestingly the sum of four squares in the equation that asserts the existence of inverses is now implicit in the multiplication of a quaternion with its conjugate.\nWe omit the correctness proof because it follows the general pattern as given in [9, 8] for\nthe rationals with out any significant complications.\nequations Zero totalized rational quaternions\nimport SkMd, Aux\noperations\ni : \u2192 ring;\nj : \u2192 ring;\nk : \u2192 ring;\nc : ring \u2192 ring;\ni2\nj2\nk2\ni*j*k\nc(i)\nc(j)\nc(x\u22121 )\nc(x + y)\nc(x * y)\n1c(x)\nZ(1 + x * c(x))\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\n20\n\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u2212i\n\u2212j\nc(x)\u22121\nc(x) + c(y)\nc(y) * c(x)\n1x\n0\n\n(33)\n(34)\n(35)\n(36)\n(37)\n(38)\n(39)\n(40)\n(41)\n(42)\n(43)\n\n\fend\nFrom these equations one easily proves: c(0) = 0, c(1) = 1, c(k) = \u2212k j2 = \u22121,\ni * j = k, j * k = i, k * i = j, j * i = \u2212k, k * j = \u2212i, i * k = \u2212j, and c(\u2212x) = \u2212c(x) and\nmany other well-known facts about quaternions. Just like in the case of complex numbers\nthe operation c may be viewed as an auxiliary operator in spite of the fact that it is a\nvery familiar one. In both cases (complex rationals and rational quaternions) the question\nwhether or not a specification can be given without an auxiliary operator is open.\n\n7\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nThe generalization of our results on meadows in [3, 4] to the noncommutative cases is\nquite satisfactory. Many issues are left open, however, notably the development of a\nstructure theory for non-central inversion rings. Another line of further work is to specify\nnonassociative algebras with a zero totalized division operator: zero totalized octonions.\nNonassociative multiplication is relevant for the subject of division by zero also if one\ncontemplates alternatives containing some form of infinity value that will serve as a proper\ninverse of zero.\nIt is easy to see that the first order theory of fields is 1-1 reducible to the first order\ntheory of meadows which in its turn is 1-1 reducible to the first order theory of skew\nmeadows. Because the first order theory of fields is undecidable so is the first order\ntheory of meadows and so is the first order theory of skew meadows.\nFor the equational theory of meadows at least these questions are currently open:\n(i) can one successfully perform a Knuth-Bendix completion, and: (ii) is the equational\ntheory of meadows decidable. The same questions can be posed for skew meadows. For the\naxioms of pseudo-commutative inversion rings, as well as the axioms for inversion rings,\nonce more the same questions can be posed, such as what rings are inversion compatible,\ni.e., can be expanded to an inversion ring?\n\nReferences\n[1] R F Arens and I Kaplansky, Topological representations of algebras, Trans.
