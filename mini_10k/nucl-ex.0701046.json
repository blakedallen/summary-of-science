To perform nuclear spectroscopic investigation on such nuclei,\ndirect reaction processes that add or remove one or a few nucleons, such as direct stripping\nand pickup reactions, from which one can identify single-particle orbitals, energies and their\noccupancies are commonly used. With the improvement of radioactive ion beam intensities\nit is now possible to obtain reliable measurements of transfer cross sections induced by\nunstable projectiles, and together with finite-range computer codes such as FRESCO [1], it\nbecomes possible to obtain spectroscopic information on unstable nuclei with good precision.\nIn particular, spectroscopic investigation of unstable lithium isotopes is of interest not\nonly for understanding nuclear structure and reaction mechanisms, where spectroscopic factors of these isotopes can be an important experimental probe for single-particle dynamics,\nshell model calculations, and halo properties [2, 3, 4, 5, 6], but also for astrophysics. In\nthe inhomogeneous nucleosynthesis models [7], reactions with 8 Li can bridge the A=8 mass\ngap and heavier elements would then be synthesized in the early universe. It also has been\npointed out that neutron-induced three-particle interactions can be important in a high\nneutron abundance environment [8]. In this case, heavier elements would be synthesized via\nthe reaction sequence 4 He(2n,\u03b3)6 He(2n,\u03b3)8 He(\u03b2 + )8 Li. Here again, 8 Li plays an important\nrole in the subsequent synthesis of heavier elements. Likewise, light neutron-rich nuclei such\nas 8 Li have been found to be important to produce seed nuclei for the r-process, e.g., in\nType-II supernovae [9].\nOnce\n8\n\n8\n\nLi is produced two possible competing chains of reactions can take place:\n\nLi(\u03b1,n)11 B(n,\u03b3)12 B(\u03b2 + )12 C and 8 Li(n,\u03b3)9 Li(\u03b1,n)12 B(\u03b2 + )12 C. The key reaction for the sec-\n\nond chain is 8 Li(n,\u03b3)9 Li. Direct measurement of this reaction is impossible because no\nneutron target exists and the half-life of 8 Li is too short (838 ms) for 8 Li to be used as a target. Thus, experimental information on the cross section for this reaction has to be obtained\nby some indirect methods. Kobayashi et al. used the Coulomb dissociation method [10],\nwhich is the inverse of the capture process. However, in this work only an upper limit for the\ncross section at low energy was obtained. Another indirect approach that may be used to\ninvestigate capture reactions is the ANC (Asymptotic Normalization Coefficient) method,\nwhere the (d,p) reaction in inverse kinematics is used to extract an \"asymptotic normal-\n\n\fization coefficient\" that can be related to the capture cross section. The ANC is obtained\nfrom peripheral transfer reactions whose amplitudes contain the same overlap function as\nthe amplitude of the corresponding capture reaction of interest [11] and therefore can be\nused to normalize the non-resonant part of the capture reaction. The method is based on\nthe assumption that capture reactions at stellar energies usually proceed through the tail\nof the nuclear overlap function. The amplitude of the radiative capture cross section is\nthen dominated by contributions from large relative distances of the participating nuclei.\nHowever, it has been shown that s-wave neutron capture, even at rather low energies, is\nnot peripheral [12, 13] and so it is necessary to use a potential model to calculate the wave\nfunction of the incoming neutron in this case. This indirect aproach, based on the potential\nmodel, has been recently applied in the analysis of the 16 O(d,p)17 O and 16 O(d,n)17 F transfer\nreactions to determine the corresponding\n\n16\n\nO(p,\u03b3)17 F and\n\n16\n\nO(n,\u03b3)17 O astrophysical direct\n\ncapture cross sections [14].\nEarly measurements of neutron transfer reactions induced by stable lithium isotopes on\na 9 Be target (9 Be(7 Li,6 Li)10 Be [15] and 9 Be(6 Li,7 Li)8 Be [16]) have shown that these reactions are good tools to obtain spectroscopic information. In this paper, we report on the\nmeasurement and analysis of angular distributions for two neutron-transfer reactions induced by a radioactive 8 Li beam: 9 Be(8 Li,9 Li)8 Be and 9 Be(8 Li,7 Li)10 Be. From a FR-DWBA\nanalysis of these angular distributions, the spectroscopic factors for the 7 Ligs \u2297n=8 Ligs and\n8\n\nLigs \u2297n=9 Ligs bound systems were extracted, and cross sections and nucleosynthesis reac-\n\ntion rates for the non-resonant part of the 7 Li(n,\u03b3)8 Li and 8 Li(n,\u03b3)9 Li capture reactions were\nderived.\n\nII.\n\nTHE EXPERIMENT\n\nAngular distributions for\n9\n\n8\n\nLi elastic scattering and the\n\n9\n\nBe(8 Li,9 Li)8 Be and\n\nBe(8 Li,7 Li)10 Be neutron transfer reactions have been measured at the Nuclear Structure\n\nLaboratory of the University of Notre Dame, USA. The 27 MeV secondary 8 Li radioactive\nbeam was obtained from the TwinSol RNB system [17]. In this system, the beam is produced in a primary target via the 9 Be(7 Li,8 Li) reaction, where a 30 MeV primary 7 Li beam\nhaving an intensity of up to 1 e\u03bcA was obtained from a 9.5 MV Tandem Van de Graaff\nAccelerator. The production target consisted of a beryllium foil 12 \u03bcm thick mounted as\n\n\fthe exit window of a gas cell which was filled with 4 He gas at a pressure of 1 atm for cooling\npurposes (the entrance window of the gas cell consisted of a 2 \u03bcm thick Havar foil). The\ntwo superconducting solenoids in the TwinSol system act as thick lenses to collect, select,\nand focus the secondary beam into a scattering chamber. The 27 MeV 8 Li beam had an\naverage intensity of 5.0 \u00d7 105 particles per second per 1 e\u03bcA of primary beam, and an energy\nresolution of 0.450 MeV (FWHM) determined from the elastic scattering measurement on a\ngold target. The beam was focused onto a 1.44 mg/cm2 thick 9 Be secondary target. Some\nbeam contaminants (4 He, 6 He and 7 Li) with the same magnetic rigidity as 8 Li were also\npresent but did not produce reaction products with mass A=8 or A=9 in the same range of\nenergy as the particles from the neutron transfer reactions of interest.\nThe scattered 8 Li particles and 7 Li and 9 Li reaction products were detected by an array of \u2206E-E Si telescopes. The measurements were performed with two setups, where a\ncombination of the 3 telescopes covered the range of laboratory angles from 15-40 degrees.\nAn overlap of angles in these setups was useful for normalization purposes. The telescopes\nconsisted of 20-25 \u03bcm Si \u2206E detectors backed by 300 \u03bcm thick Si E detectors. The detector telescopes had circular apertures which subtended a solid angle of 4 msr for the most\nforward-angle measurements and 8-15 msr for the backward angles. A collimator placed in\nfront of the first solenoid limited the angular acceptance of the particles produced in the\nprimary target to the range of 2.50 \u2212 6.00 . This introduces an angular divergence in the\nsecondary beam of about \u00b130 . Since the angular aperture of the collimators in front of\nthe detectors was also about \u00b130 , the average detection angle were determined by a Monte\nCarlo simulation, which took into account the collimator size in front of the detectors, the\nsecondary beam spot size on the secondary target (4mm), the secondary beam divergence\nand the angular distribution in the range of the detector aperture (Rutherford on gold and\ncalculated in an iterative way for the 9 Be target).\nThe simultaneous measurement of the transfer products and elastic scattering was very\nuseful to check the consistency of the overall normalization and to select an optimal set\nof optical-model potential parameters. The latter are very important in the FR-DWBA\ntransfer calculations. During the experiment 8 Li elastic scattering on a gold target, which\nwas pure Rutherford, was also measured to obtain the absolute normalization of the data.\n\n\fIII.\n\nDATA ANALYSIS\n\nReaction products were identified using a two dimensional [C(Z, M) \u00d7 Etotal ] plot. The\nparticle identification constant, C(Z, M), is given by: C(Z, M) = (Etotal )b \u2212 (Etotal \u2212 \u2206E)b\n[18], where Etotal = \u2206E + Eresidual and b = 1.70 for these light particles. This constant\nappears as straight lines as a function of the energy for each Z and M particle in the two\ndimensional spectrum [C(Z, M) \u00d7 Etotal ]. A typical particle identification spectrum is shown\nin Fig. 1 for the lithium and helium isotope region. In this plot the 8 Li scattered beam\nparticles and the 9 Li and 7 Li reaction products are shown and could be easily identified.\n\nA.\n\nElastic scattering\n\nThe 8 Li energy spectra were obtained by selecting and projecting the 8 Li region in the\n[C(M, Z) \u00d7 Etotal ] plot. The experimental resolution, 0.450 MeV (FWHM), was sufficient to\nseparate elastic scattering from inelastic scattering to the first excited state of 8 Li (Ex =0.980\nMeV). The experimental angular distribution obtained for the elastic scattering of 8 Li on 9 Be\nis shown in Fig. 2. The data were analyzed with the optical model (OM) using volume-type\nWoods-Saxon nuclear potentials and Coulomb potentials due to uniform charged spheres.\nThe optical parameters used to describe the 9 Be(8 Li,8 Li) elastic scattering are from Refs.\n[15] and [19] and they are listed in Table I. The results of the OM calculations using these\npotential parameters can be seen in Fig. 2. The OM calculations show more oscillations\nthan the elastic scattering data. In the Fig. 2-b we show the calculated angular distributions\nsmeared by the range of the angular aperture and beam angular dispersion (\u2206\u0398=10 deg.\nin the C.M.). As one can see, the comparison with the data is improved by smearing the\ncalculated angular distributions. The curve indicated as the SP-Potential corresponds to\nOM calculations using the Sao Paulo Potential [20], which is a double-folding potential with\nenergy dependence and non-locality correction. Including a spin-orbit term, VSO = 7.0\nMeV, in the optical potential did not change the results. Although there was no attempt\nto adjust the parameters to fit the data, the calculations with all of these potentials give a\ngood description of the elastic scattering data. The SP-Potential also reproduces quite well\nthe absolute normalization, which is of some interest considering that this folding-model\npotential has no free parameters.\n\n\fThese potentials were used in the DWBA calculations for the transfer reactions as described in the following sections.\n\nB.\n\nNeutron stripping reaction: 9 Be(8 Li,7 Li)10 Be\n\nThe 9 Be(8 Li,7 Ligs )10 Begs reaction has a positive Q-value of +4.780 MeV. Thus, the 7 Li\nparticles from this transfer reaction could easily be separated from the elastic 8 Li particles\nin the C(M, Z)\u00d7 Energy plot. At the most forward angles (15 and 18 degrees) the 7 Li group\nwas double peaked due to inelastic scattering to the first excited state of 7 Li\u2217 at Ex=0.470\nMeV. Although the overall experimental energy resolution (0.450 MeV) was barely sufficient\nto resolve the 7 Li ground state from the first excited state, it appears that (8 Li,7 Ligs ) was\nthe dominant neutron-transfer mode. At backward angles, the 7 Li groups observed were\ncentered at the g.s. energies and were not double peaked, at least within the statistics\nobtained. At the most forward angles, the second excited state of 7 Li (Ex =2.70 MeV) was\nalso observed but is not considered in the present analysis. The angular distribution for\nthe 9 Be(8 Li,7 Ligs )10 Begs reaction is shown in Fig. 3. As can be seen, the differential cross\nsections for this transfer process are not very large (less than 1 mb/sr) which made the\nmeasurements quite difficult at the backward angles due to the limited secondary beam\nintensity.\nFinite-range distorted-wave Born approximation (FR-DWBA) calculations for the\n9\n\nBe(8 Li,7 Li) neutron transfer reaction have been performed using the code FRESCO [1].\n\nFor each FR-DWBA calculation, the same optical-model potential parameters (Table-I)\nwere used for both entrance (8 Li+9 Be) and exit (7 Li+10 Be) channels. The bound-state wave\nfunctions were generated with Woods-Saxon potentials and geometric parameters r = 1.25\nfm and a = 0.65 fm, with the depths of the potentials adjusted to give the correct separation energies. In the present (8 Li,7 Li) DWBA calculation the neutron is considered to be\ntransfered from the p3/2 orbital in 8 Ligs (J \u03c0 = 2+ ) to the p3/2 orbital in\nleaving 7 Li in its ground-state J \u03c0 =\n\n3\u2212\n.\n2\n\n10\n\nBegs (J \u03c0 = 0+ ),\n\nThere is a possibility of a contribution from the\n\np1/2 admixture in the 8 Li ground-state but according to a spectroscopic factor calculation by\nCohen and Kurath this contribution is about 5% and it was not considered in the transfer\nreaction DWBA calculation. One-nucleon transfer reactions provide a spectroscopic factor\nfor one vertex if that of the other vertex is known. In the FR-DWBA calculation for the\n\n\f9\n\nBe(8 Li,7 Li)10 Be neutron transfer reaction, the spectroscopic factor for the 9 Begs \u2297n=10 Begs\n\nsystem was taken to be S10 Be =2.23\u00b10.13, which is the average of values from two (d,p)\nstudies [21, 22] (see Table-II). By normalizing the calculation to the experimental data,\na spectroscopic factor of S8 Li (g.s.)=1.03 \u00b1 0.15 was obtained for the 7 Ligs \u2297n=8 Ligs vertex. This value is compatible with the Cohen and Kurath shell model calculations [23] (see\nTable-II). A similar situation has been found in the analysis of the 9 Be(7 Li,6 Li)10 Be [15]\nand 9 Be(6 Li,7 Li)8 Be reactions [16], where the spectroscopic factor for both vertices involved\nin the transfer agreed with values calculated by Cohen and Kurath. These results indicate\nthat Cohen-Kurath wave functions describe stable lithium and beryllium isotopes in the\nmass range A=6 to A=10 reasonably well.\n\nC.\n\nNeutron pick-up: 9 Be(8 Li,9 Li)8 Be\n\nThe 9 Be(8 Li,9 Li)8 Be neutron-transfer reaction can proceed by two possible contributions\nthat leave 9 Li in its ground state. These correspond to neutron transfer to either a 1p1/2 or\n1p3/2 orbit in 9 Li. Here only transfer to the 1p3/2 orbit is considered because the contribution\nof the 1p1/2 orbit has been found to be less than 5% [24]. Finite-range distorted-wave Born\napproximation (FR-DWBA) calculations for the 9 Be(8 Li,9 Li) neutron transfer reaction have\nbeen performed using also the code FRESCO [1]. For each FR-DWBA calculation, the same\noptical-model potential parameters (Table-I) were used for both entrance (8 Li+9 Be) and exit\n(9 Li+8 Be) channels. The bound-state wave functions were generated with Woods-Saxon\npotentials and geometric parameters r = 1.25 fm and a = 0.65 fm, with the depths of the\npotentials adjusted to give the correct separation energies. To obtain the spectroscopic factor\nfor the 8 Ligs \u2297n=9 Ligs vertex, the spectroscopic factor for 8 Begs \u2297n=9 Begs must be known.\nA value of S9 Be = 0.44(7) was used for this vertex, which is the average of spectroscopic\nfactors from two (d,t) reactions [21], [26]. This is somewhat smaller than the Cohen-Kurath\nprediction (see Table-II). Normalizing the FR-DWBA calculation to the experimental data,\na spectroscopic factor of S9 Li = 0.62 \u00b1 0.13 was obtained for the 8 Ligs \u2297n=9 Ligs bound\nsystem. The results of the FR-DWBA calculations with different sets of parameters are\nshown in Fig. 4. As one can see, the calculations agree extremely well with the data at\nforward angles. The uncertainty in the spectroscopic factor is estimated to be about 20%\ndue to the uncertainties in the experimental data at forward angles and in the spectroscopic\n\n\ffactor for the 8 Begs \u2297n=9 Begs vertex.\nThe spectroscopic factor obtained for the 8 Ligs \u2297n=9 Ligs system in the present analysis\nis compared with other experimental values and shell model calculations in Table-II. Our\nresult agrees very well with the value from the shell model calculation of Ref. [5] and with\nthe experimental value obtained from a (d,p) reaction at lower energy [25], but is lower than\nthe values obtained from a recent calculation using Cohen and Kurath wave functions [27]\nand from a (d,p) reaction study at higher energy [28]. An analysis with the SP foldingmodel potential was also performed and spectroscopic factors S8 Li =0.68 and S9 Li =0.40 were\nobtained. These values are about 35% lower than those obtained with SET 1,2, and 3 for\nboth the (8 Li,7 Li) and (8 Li,9 Li) transfer reactions. This may be related to non-locality effects\nwhich are taken into account in the folding-model potential but not in the optical model\npotentials. Further investigation of this subject appears to be warranted.\nTo extract the spectroscopic factors from the present transfer angular distributions, only\nthe angular range \u03b8CM \u2264 45 degrees was considered. To verify the peripherality of this\ntransfer reaction, the influence of the internal part of the overlap function was tested in the\nDWBA calculation. The result of such a test can be seen in Fig. 5. Increasing the radius\ncut in the radial integral up to Rcut =4.0 fm did not produce any change in the FR-DWBA\ncalculation in the angular range from 0-45 deg. Only for Rcut >5.0 fm, which corresponds\nto a radius larger than the distance of closest approach of the two interacting nuclei (i.e.,\n1/3\n\n1/3\n\nR = 1.25 \u00d7 (A1 + A2 ) fm), is the calculation sensitive to the radius cut, as observed in\nthe change of the trend in the curve for Rcut =5.0 fm as compared with the other curves in\nFig. 5.\n\nIV.\n\nRADIATIVE NEUTRON CAPTURE REACTIONS\n\nTo calculate the 7 Li(n,\u03b3)8 Li and 8 Li(n,\u03b3)9 Li radiative capture reaction cross sections, the\ncomputer code RADCAP [29], based on a potential model, was used. In the potential-model\nframework, the direct neutron radiative capture by a nucleus b going to a composite nucleus\nc via a transition with E1 electric dipole character is given by:\nE1\n\u03c3b\u2192c\n(n, \u03b3) =\n\n16\u03c0 3 E1 2\nk |Q | ,\n9h\u0304 \u03b3 b\u2192c\n\n(1)\n\nwhere k\u03b3 = \u01eb\u03b3 /h\u0304c is the wave number corresponding to a \u03b3-ray energy \u01eb\u03b3 . The term QE1 is\n\n\fthe E1 transition matrix element given by:\nE1\nQE1\nb\u2192c =< \u03c8scat |O |Ibound >,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere O E1 stands for the electric dipole operator and the initial-state wave function \u03c8scat\nis the incoming neutron wave function scattered by the neutron-nucleus potential. Here the\neffective charge for the neutrons used in the eletric dipole operator is given by eef f = \u2212eZ/A,\nwhere A is the mass of the compound nucleus. The wave functions necessary in the potential\nmodel are obtained by solving the scattering and bound-state systems, respectively, for a\ngiven potential. Thus, the essential ingredients of the model are the potentials used to\ngenerate the wave functions \u03c8scat and Ibound , and the normalization for the latter which is\ngiven by the spectroscopic factor.\n\nA.\n\nThe 7 Li(n,\u03b3)8 Li capture reaction\n\nThe direct radiative capture (DRC) of a s- or d-wave neutron by 7 Li, leaving the 8 Li\ncompound nucleus in either the ground state (J \u03c0 = 2+ ) or the first excited state(J \u03c0 = 1+ ,\nEx = 0.980 MeV) proceeds by an E1 transition. To calculate the capture cross section in\nthe potential model, a Woods-Saxon form with radius and diffuseness parameters r0 = 1.25\nfm and d = 0.65 fm, respectively, was adopted for both bound-state and scattering potentials. The depth of the bound-state potentials, V0 (g.s.) = 46.38 MeV and V0 (1st.) = 43.30\nMeV, were adjusted to reproduce the corresponding binding energies (Eg.s. = 2.033 MeV\nand E1st = 1.052 MeV) of the 8 Li ground state and first excited state, respectively. The\npotentials used to describe the scattering of the neutron by the 7 Li nucleus also had geometric parameters r0 = 1.25 fm and d = 0.65 fm. Well depths of V0 = 56.15 MeV and\nV0 = 46.50 MeV were used for the two channel-spin components s = 2 and s = 1, respectively. These potentials were obtained by Nagai et al. [13] by adjusting the well depths to\nreproduce the experimental n+7 Li scattering lengths (a+ = \u22123.63 and a\u2212 = +0.87) of the\ntwo channel-spin components. To calculate the cross sections for the 7 Li(n,\u03b3)8 Li capture\nreaction, leaving 8 Li in the ground state (J \u03c0 = 2+ ) and first excited state(J \u03c0 = 1+ ), we\nused the same potential parameters for the scattering potentials and the same spectroscopic\nfactors (i.e., S8 Li (g.s.)=0.87 and S8 Li (1st)=0.48 for the 7 Ligs \u2297n=8 Ligs and 7 Ligs \u2297n=8 Li1st ,\nrespectively) as obtained by Nagai et al. [13]. The results of this calculation, assuming only\n\n\fan s-wave neutron capture, are compared in Fig. 6 with the experimental data from Refs.\n[13], [38], [39], [40] and [41]. The s-wave direct neutron capture contribution is the dominant\nprocess, and the contribution from the d-wave neutron is found to be negligible (less than\n0.5 percent) at these low energies. The upper solid curve in Fig. 6 was obtained by using the\nspectroscopic factor S8 Li (g.s.)=1.03 (15) for the 7 Ligs \u2297n=8 Ligs bound state obtained from\nthe present analysis of the 9 Be(8 Li,7 Li) transfer reaction. The different potentials used for\nthe two different couplings of the entrance channel spin were crucial in the calculation to\ncorrectly describe the known data. As can be seen, this produces a better agreement of the\ncalculation with the low-energy data. Once we have verified that the procedure to obtain the\nparameters used in the potential model calculation reproduced the experimentally known\ncross section for the 7 Li(n,\u03b3)8 Li capture reaction, we now extend this procedure to calculate\nthe cross section for the 8 Li(n,\u03b3)9 Ligs capture reaction.\n\nB.\n\nThe 8 Li(n,\u03b3)9 Li capture reaction\n\nAs mentioned above, the radiative neutron capture cross section for the 8 Li(n,\u03b3)9 Ligs\nreaction cannot be obtained from a direct measurement. We here use the same prescription, based on a potential model, that was followed to calculated the cross section for\nthe 7 Li(n,\u03b3)8 Li reaction. The capture cross sections were calculated assuming that the\n8\n\nLi(n,\u03b3)9 Ligs reaction proceeds by direct E1 capture of an s-wave neutron by 8 Li(J \u03c0 = 2+ )\n\nleading to the 9 Li(J \u03c0 = 3/2\u2212 ) ground state. The optical-model potential used to generate\nthe distorted wave for neutron scattering on the unstable 8 Li nucleus cannot be obtained\nexperimentally. Instead, we used the same volume integral per nucleon as that of the n-7 Li\npotentials. Experimental optical-model parameters can vary strongly for different systems,\nbut the volume integral per nucleon of a potential is known to have less ambiguity and thus\nit can be considered a more stable quantity as a function of the masses of the interacting\nnuclei [25, 42, 43]. Thus, by scaling the real depth of the two entrance-channel spin components, s = 1 and s = 2, from the known n-7 Li potential in the previous analysis, and\nkeeping the same volume integrals of the potential per nucleon (JV /A = 793 MeV fm3 and\nJV /A = 657 MeV fm3 , respectively), V0 = 58.15 MeV and V0 = 48.15 are obtained for the\ndepths of the potential wells for the two channel-spins (s = 5/2 and s = 3/2, respectively) of\nthe n(1/2+ )+8 Li(2+ ) system. To calculate the overlap integral of the 8 Li\u2297n=9 Ligs bound-\n\n\fsystem, a Woods-Saxon shaped potential is also considered. A depth V0 = 47.82 MeV was\nobtained for potential by adjusting it to reproduce the binding energy (E=4.064 MeV). The\nnormalization of this overlap integral is giving by the spectroscopic factor S9 Li (g.s.)=0.62\n(7) extracted from the present analysis of the 9 Be(8 Li,9 Li)8 Be transfer reaction. With these\npotentials and the spectroscopic factor, the cross sections for the non-resonant part of the\ns-wave neutron capture reaction were calculated as a function of relative energy for both\nchannel spins. The results of these calculations are shown in Fig. 7. The curve labeled (a)\ncorresponds to the sum of the contribution of channel-spin s = 3/2 and s = 5/2, where each\ncontribution was calculated with different scattering potential. The curves (b) correspond to\na different assumption for the scattering potential in which the well depths are the same as\nthat for the bound state. The dotted curve is obtained considering only an s-wave neutron,\nand the solid line is the sum of the s and d-wave ontributions. As one can see in Fig. 7, the\nonset of the higher partial wave component is observable only at higher energies.\nIn order to compare our results for the\n\n8\n\nLi(n,\u03b3)9 Ligs capture reaction with other\n\nmeasurements and calculations, we have computed the nucleosynthesis reaction rate. The\nexpression for the reaction rate for E1 capture in cm3 mol\u22121 s\u22121 is given by [30]:\nNA < \u03c3v >= K\n\nR\u221e\n0\n\n\u03c3(E)Eexp(\u2212C2 E/T9 )dE,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere\n\u22123/2\n\nK = C1 \u03bc\u22121/2 T9\n\nand C1 = 3.7313 \u00d7 1010 , C2 = 11.605, NA is Avogadro's number, \u03bc is the reduced\nmass of the system, T9 is the temperature in units of 109 K, \u03c3 is the capture cross section,\nv is the relative velocity, and E is the energy in the center-of-mass system. E is given in\nMeV and the cross section in barns.\nThe reaction rate for the 8 Li(n,\u03b3)9 Ligs capture reaction was estimated at a temperature\nT9 = 1 and the integral of the expression [3] was performed up to 1.2 MeV. At this temperature, the capture reaction becomes important for the synthesis of heavier elements in\nthe inhomogeneous Big Bang model. Also, the role of light neutron-rich nuclei for the rprocess in Type-II supernovae seems to be important at temperatures 0.5 < T9 < 4 [9].\n\n\fAlthough the resonant capture through the\n\n5\u2212\n2\n\nresonance in 9 Li could be important for tem-\n\nperatures higher than T9 = 0.5, in the present calculation only the direct capture to 9 Li at\nthe ground-state is considered.\nAt energies up to 1 MeV, the capture reaction is completely dominated by s-wave\nneutrons. The contribution of the d-wave neutron to the reaction rate is estimated to be\nless than 0.5% at these energies and it becomes important only at high energies. Assuming\na distorted wave from the potentials that have the same volume integral per nucleon as\nfor the n+7 Li system, the reaction rate for the 8 Li(n,\u03b3)9 Ligs capture reaction was deduced\nto be NA < \u03c3v >= (3.17 \u00b1 0.70) \u00d7 103 cm3 mol\u22121 s\u22121 , where the uncertainty is from the\nuncertainty in the spectroscopic factor used in the calculation (20%) and from the variation\nof \u00b11 MeV in the potentials used to determined the distorted wave (10%). As suggested\nby Mengoni, et al. [12], a different assumption would be to use the same potential for the\nincoming channel as that for the bound state. With this assumption for the n-8 Li potential,\nthe reaction rate is determined to be NA < \u03c3v >= (3.23 \u00b1 0.71) \u00d7 103 cm3 mol\u22121 s\u22121 . The\naverage value adopted here is:\nNA < \u03c3v >= (3.20 \u00b1 0.70) \u00d7 103 cm3 mol\u22121 s\u22121 .\nIn Fig.\n\n8, this value is compared with theoretical calculations reported in Refs.\n\n[31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36] and experimental estimations from Refs. [37], [10] and [25]. Our\nresult is comparable to the most recent theoretical calculations [33, 34, 35, 36] and is in\ngood agreement with the value from a recent (d,p) experiment [25]. The small difference\nobtained in the reaction rate between these two experiments can be attributed in part to\nthe different approaches used in the calculation of the neutron scattering potential. Both\nresults are significantly higher than the upper limit obtained in the most recent Coulomb\ndissociation experiment by Kobayashi,et al. [10].\nA 1/v behavior of the capture cross section as a function of relative energy is expected\nfor s-wave neutron capture at low energies. However, as can be seen in Fig. 7, the reaction\nrate obtained in the potential model follows a 1/v dependence only for very low energies\n(En < 0.1 MeV). Normalizing a 1/v curve to the values given by the potential model in the\nenergy range from 0-0.1 MeV, the corresponding expression for the capture cross section\nbecomes:\n\n\f\u03c3(n, \u03b3) = 3.95 \u00d7 En\u22121/2 ,\nwhere En is the neutron energy in MeV and \u03c3(n, \u03b3) is given in \u03bcb. The corresponding reaction rate integrated over the range up to 1.2 MeV (which would be in this case\nenergy independent) is:\nNA < \u03c3v >= 3.27 \u00d7 103 cm3 mol\u22121 s\u22121 ,\nwhich is in agreement with the value obtained directly from the potential model and\nalso much higher than the upper limit obtained by Kobayashi et al. [10].\n\nV.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nWe have measured the angular distributions for the elastic scattering of 8 Li on 9 Be and\nthe neutron transfer reactions 9 Be(8 Li,7 Li)10 Be and 9 Be(8 Li,9 Li)8 Be at ELAB = 27.0 MeV.\nSpectroscopic factors for the 8 Ligs \u2297n=9 Ligs and 7 Ligs \u2297n=8 Ligs bound systems were obtained\nfrom the comparison between the experimental differential cross sections and FR-DWBA\ncalculations with the code FRESCO. The spectroscopic factors obtained are compared with\nshell model calculations and also with experimental values from (d,p) reactions. Using the\nspectroscopic factors extracted from the angular distributions for the 8 Ligs \u2297n=9 Ligs and\n7\n\nLigs \u2297n=8 Ligs bound system, we have derived the cross-sections for the 7 Li(n,\u03b3)8 Li and\n\n8\n\nLi(n,\u03b3)9 Ligs neutron capture reactions based on a potential model. The reaction rates for\n\nthe non-resonant part of the 8 Li(n,\u03b3)9 Ligs reaction are compared with the results from previous indirect methods and with theoretical calculations. Our work has shown that low energy\nradioactive nuclear beams can be very suitable not only to perform spectroscopic investigations but also to determine the non-resonant parts of capture reactions of astrophysics\ninterest.\n\n\fAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors wish to thank the Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo\n(FAPESP 2001/06676-9 and 2006/00629-2) for financial support.
