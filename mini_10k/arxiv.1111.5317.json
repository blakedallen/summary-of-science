Let P denote the category of strict polynomial functors\nif p = 0 and sl\ndefined over k. We describe a g-action on P (in the sense of Chuang and Rouquier)\ncategorifying the Fock space representation of g.\nDedicated, with gratitude and\nadmiration, to Prof. Nolan Wallach\non the occasion of his 70th birthday.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nFix an infinite field k of characteristic p. In this work we elaborate on a study, begun\nin [HY], of the relationship between the symmetric groups Sd , the general linear groups\nGLn (k), and the Kac-Moody algebra g, where\ng=\n\nsl\u221e (C) if p = 0\nb p (C) if p 6= 0\nsl\n\nIn [HY] Hong and Yacobi defined a category M constructed as an inverse limit of polynomial representations of the general linear groups. The main result of [HY] is that g acts on\nM (in the sense of Chuang and Rouquier), and categorifies the Fock space representation\nof g.\nThe result in [HY] is motivated by a well known relationship between the basic representation of g and the symmetric groups. Let Rd denote the category of representations\nof Sd over k, and let R denote the direct sum of categories Rd . By work going back\nat least to Lascoux, Leclerc, and Thibon [LLT], it is known that R is a categorification of the basic representation of g. This means that there are exact endo-functors\nEi , Fi : R \u2192 R (i \u2208 Z/pZ) whose induced operators on the Grothedieck group give rise\nto a representation of g isomorphic to its basic representation.\nSince R consists of all representations of all symmetric groups, and the representations\nof symmetric groups and general linear groups are related via Schur-Weyl duality, it is\nnatural to seek a category which canonically considers all polynomial representations of\nall general linear groups. This is precisely the limit category of polynomial representations\nalluded to above.\nThe limit category M is naturally equivalent to the category P of \"strict polynomial\nfunctors of finite degree\" introduced by Friedlander and Suslin in [FS] (in characteristic\n\n1\n\n\fzero the category P appears in [Mac]). The objects of P are endo-functors on Vk (the category of finite dimensional vector spaces over k) satisfying natural polynomial conditions,\nand the morphisms are natural transformations of functors.\nFriedlander and Suslin's original motivation was to study the finite generation of\naffine group schemes. Since their landmark work, the theory of polynomial functors has\ndeveloped in many directions. In algebraic topology, the category P is connected to\nthe category of unstable modules over the Steenrod algebra, to the cohomology of the\nfinite linear groups [FFSS, Ku], and also to derived functors in the sense of Dold and\nPuppe [T2]. Polynomial functors are also applied to the cohomology of group schemes.\nFor example the category P is used in the study of support varieties for finite group\nschemes [SFB], to compute the cohomology of classical groups [T1], and in the proof of\ncohomological finite generation for reductive groups [TvdK].\nThe goal of this paper is to develop an explicit connection relating the category of\nstrict polynomial functors to the affine Kac-Moody algebra g. We describe an action of\ng on P (in the sense of Chuang and Rouquier), which is completely independent of the\nresults or arguments in [HY]. The main advantage of this approach is that the category\nP affords a more canonical setting for the g-categorification. Indeed, many of the results\nobtained in [HY] have a simple and natural formulation in this setting. Further, we hope\nthat the ideas presented here will provide new insight to the category polynomial functors.\nAs an example of this, in the last section of the paper we describe how the categorification\ntheory implies that certain blocks of the category P are derived equivalent.\nThe category of strict polynomial functors is actually defined over arbitrary fields, but\nthe general definition given in [FS] is more involved than the one we use (the problem\ncomes from the fact that different polynomials might induce the same function over finite\nfields). All our results remain valid in this general context, but we have opted to work\nover an infinite field to simplify the exposition. In addition, we assume in our main\ntheorem that p 6= 2. The theorem is valid also for p = 2, but including this case would\ncomplicate our exposition.\nIn the sequel to this work we continue the study of P from the point of view of higher\nrepresentation theory [HY2]. We show that Khovanov's category H naturally acts on\nP, and this gives a categorification of the Fock space representation of the Heisenberg\nalgebra when char(k) = 0. When char(k) > 0 the commuting actions of g \u2032 (the derived\nalgebra of g) and the Heisenberg algebra are also categorified. Moreover, we formulate\nSchur-Weyl duality as a functor from P to the category of linear species. The category\nof linear species is known to carry actions of g and the Heisenberg algebra. We prove\nthat Schur-Weyl duality is a tensor functor which is a morphism of these categorifications\nstructures.\n\n2\n\nType A Kac-Moody algebras\n\nLet g denote the following Kac-Moody algebra (over C):\ng=\n\nsl\u221e if p = 0\nb p if p > 0\nsl\n2\n\n\fBy definition, the Kac-Moody algebra sl\u221e is associated to the Dynkin diagram:\n***\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n***\n\nb p is associated to the diagram with p nodes:\nwhile the Kac-Moody algebra sl\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n***\n\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\nThe Lie algebra g has standard Chevalley generators {ei , fi }i\u2208Z/pZ . Here, and throughout,\nwe identify Z/pZ with the prime subfield of k. For the precise relations defining g see\ne.g. [Kac].\nWe let Q denote the root lattice and P the weight lattice of g. Let {\u03b1i : i \u2208 Z/pZ}\ndenote the set of simple roots, and {hi : i \u2208 Z/pZ} the simple coroots. The cone of\ndominant weights is denoted P+ and denote the fundamental weights {\u039bi : i \u2208 Z/pZ}, i.e.\nhhi , \u039bj i = \u03b4ij . When p > 0 the Cartan subalgebra\nof g is spanned by the hi along with\nP\nan element d. In this case we also let \u03b4 = i \u03b1i ; then \u039b0 , ..., \u039bp\u22121 , \u03b4 form a Z-basis for\nP. When p = 0 the fundamental weights are a Z basis for the weight lattice.\nLet Sn denote the symmetric group on n letters. Sn acts on the polynomial algebra\nZ[x1 , ..., xn ] by permuting variables, and we denote by Bn = Z[x1 , ..., xn ]Sn the polynomials invariant under this action. There is a natural projection Bn \u0589 Bn\u22121 given by setting\nthe last variable to zero. Consequently, the rings Bn form a inverse system; let BZ denote\nthe subspace of finite degree elements in the inverse limit lim Bn . This is the algebra of\n\u2190\u2212\nsymmetric functions in infinitely many variables {x1 , x2 , ...}. Let B = BZ \u2297Z C denote the\n(bosonic) Fock space.\nThe algebra BZ has many well-known bases. Perhaps the nicest is the basis of Schur\nfunctions (see e.g. [Mac]). Let \u2118 denote the set of all partitions, and for \u03bb \u2208 \u2118 let\ns\u03bb \u2208 BZ denote the corresponding Schur function. These form a Z-basis of the algebra of\nsymmetric functions:\nM\nZs\u03bb .\nBZ =\n\u03bb\u2208\u2118\n\nLet us review some combinatorial notions related to Young diagrams. Firstly, we\nidentify partitions with their Young diagram (using English notation). For example the\npartition (4, 4, 2, 1) corresponds to the diagram\n\nThe content of a box in position (k, l) is the integer l \u2212 k \u2208 Z/pZ. Given \u03bc, \u03bb \u2208 \u2118, we\n/ \u03bb if \u03bb can be obtained from \u03bc by adding some box. If the arrow is labelled\nwrite \u03bc\ni then \u03bb is obtained from \u03bc by adding a box of content i (an i-box, for short). For\n2 /\ninstance, if m = 3, \u03bc = (2) and \u03bb = (2, 1) then \u03bc\n\u03bb . An i-box of \u03bb is addable (resp.\nremovable) if it can be added to (resp. removed from) \u03bb to obtain another partition.\nOf central importance to us is the Fock space representation\nof g on B (or BZ ). The\nP\naction of g on B is given by the following formulas: ei .s\u03bb =\ns\u03bc , the sum over all \u03bc such\n\n3\n\n\fP\ni /\ni /\n\u03bc . Moreover,\ns\u03bc , the sum over all \u03bc such that \u03bb\nthat \u03bc\n\u03bb , and fi .s\u03bb =\nd acts on s\u03bb by m0 (\u03bb), where m0 (\u03bb) is the number of boxes of content zero in \u03bb. These\nequations define an integral representation of g.(see e.g. [LLT]).\nNote that s\u2205 is a highest weight vector of highest weight \u039b0 . We note also that the\nstandard basis of B is a weight basis. Let mi (\u03bb) denote the number of i-boxes of \u03bb. Then\ns\u03bb is of weight wt(\u03bb), where\nX\nwt(\u03bb) = \u039b0 \u2212\nmi (\u03bb)\u03b1i .\n(1)\ni\n\nFor a k-linear abelian category C, let K0 (C) denote the Grothendieck group of C, and let\nK(C) denote the complexification of K0 (C). If A \u2208 C we let [A] denote its image in K0 (C).\nSimiarly, for an exact functor F : C \u2192 C \u2032 we let [F] : K0 (C) \u2192 K0 (C \u2032 ) denote the induced\noperator on the Grothendieck groups. Slightly abusing notation, the complexification of\n[F] is also denoted by [F].\n\n3\n\nThe definition of g-categorification\n\n\"Higher representation theory\" of g concerns the action of g on categories rather than\non vector spaces. At the very least, an action of g on a k-linear additive category C\nconsists of the data of exact endo-functors Ei and Fi on C (for i \u2208 Z/pZ), such that g\nacts on K(C) via the assignment ei 7\u2192 [Ei ] and fi 7\u2192 [Fi ]. For instance, if i and j are not\nconnected in the Dynkin diagram of g (i.e. [ei , fj ] = 0), then we require that [[Ei ], [Fj ]] = 0\nin End(K(C)). This is known as a \"weak categorification\".\nThis notion is qualified as \"weak\" because the relations defining g, such as [ei , fj ] = 0,\nare not lifted to the level of categories. A stronger notion of categorification would\nrequire isomorphisms of functors lifting the relations of g, e.g. functorial isomorphisms\nEi \u25e6 Fj \u2243 Fj \u25e6 Ei . Moreover, these isomorphisms need to be compatible in a suitable sense.\nMaking these ideas precise leads to an enriched theory, which introduces new symmetries\ncoming from an affine Hecke algebra.\nTo give the definition of g-categorification we use here, due to Chuang and Rouquier (a\nrelated formulation appears in the works of Khovanov and Lauda [KL]), we first introduce\nthe relevant Hecke algebra.\nDefinition 3.1. Let DHn be the degenerate affine Hecke algebra of GLn . As an abelian\ngroup\nDHn = Z[y1 , ..., yn ] \u2297 ZSn .\nThe algebra structure is defined as follows: Z[y1 , ..., yn ] and ZSn are subalgebras, and\nthe following relations hold between the generators of these subalgebras:\n\u03c4i yj = yj \u03c4i if |i \u2212 j| \u2265 1\nand\n\u03c4i yi+1 \u2212 yi \u03c4i = 1\n(here \u03c41 , ..., \u03c4n\u22121 are the simple generators of ZSn ).\n4\n\n(2)\n\n\fRemark 3.2. One can replace Relation (2) by\n\u03c4i yi \u2212 yi+1 \u03c4i = 1.\n\n(3)\n\nThese two presentations are equivalent; the isomorphism is given by:\n\u03c4i 7\u2192 \u03c4n\u2212i , yi 7\u2192 yn+1\u2212i .\n\nDefinition 3.3. [Definition 5.29 in [R]] Let C be an abelian k-linear category. A gcategorification on C is the data of:\n1. An adjoint pair (E, F) of exact functors C \u2192 C,\n\n2. morphisms of functors X \u2208 End(E) and T \u2208 End(E2 ), and\nL\n3. a decomposition C = \u03c9\u2208P C\u03c9 .\nLet X\u25e6 \u2208 End(F) be the endomorphism of F induced by adjunction. Then given a \u2208 k let\nEa (resp. Fa ) be the generalized a-eigensubfunctor of X (resp. X\u25e6 ) acting on E (resp. F).\nWe assume that\nL\n4. E = i\u2208Z/pZ Ei ,\n5. the action of {[Ei ], [Fi ]}i\u2208Z/pZ on K(C) gives rise to an integrable representation of g,\n6. for all i, Ei (C\u03c9 ) \u2282 C\u03c9+\u03b1i and Fi (C\u03c9 ) \u2282 C\u03c9\u2212\u03b1i ,\n7. the functor F is isomorphic to the left adjoint of E, and\n8. the degenerate affine Hecke algebra DHn acts on End(En ) via\n\nand\n\nyi 7\u2192 En\u2212i XEi\u22121 for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n,\n\n(4)\n\n\u03c4i 7\u2192 En\u2212i\u22121 TEi\u22121 for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n \u2212 1.\n\n(5)\n\nRemark 3.4. The definition (cf. Definition 5.29 in [R]) uses Relation (2). For our\npurposes we use Relation (3). On the representations of the symmetric groups (the main\nexample considered in [CR, Section 3.1.2]) another variant of Relation (3) is used .\nRemark 3.5. To clarify notation, the natural endomorphism yi of En assigns to M \u2208 C\nan endomorphism of En (M) as follows: apply the functor En\u2212i to the morphism\nXEi\u22121 (M) : Ei (M) \u2192 Ei (M).\n\nThe functorial isomorphisms lifting the defining relations of g are constructed from the\ndata of g-categorification. More precisely, the adjunctions between E and F and the functorial morphisms X and T are introduced precisely for this purpose. The action of DHn\non End(En ) in part (8) of Definition 3.3 is needed in order to express the compatibility\nbetween the functorial isomorphisms. See [R] for details.\n\n5\n\n\f4\n\nPolynomial functors\n\n4.1\n\nThe category P\n\nOur main goal in this paper is to define a g-categorification on the category P of strict\npolynomial functors of finite degree, and show that this categorifies the Fock space representation of g. In this section we define the category P and recall some of its basic\nfeatures.\nLet Vk denote the category of finite dimensional vector spaces over k. For V, W \u2208 Vk ,\npolynomial maps from V to W are by definition elements of S(V \u2217 ) \u2297 W, where S(V \u2217 )\ndenotes the symmetric algebra of the linear dual of V. Elements of Sd (V \u2217 ) \u2297 W are said\nto be homogeneous of degree d.\nDefinition 4.1. The objects of the category P are functors M : Vk \u2192 Vk that satisfy\nthe following properties:\n1. for any V, W \u2208 Vk , the map of vector spaces\n\nis polynomial, and\n\nHomk (V, W) \u2192 Homk (M(V), M(W))\n\n2. the degree of the map\nEndk (V) \u2192 Endk (M(V))\n\nis bounded with respect to V \u2208 Vk .\n\nThe morphisms in P are natural transformations of functors. For M \u2208 P we denote by\n1M \u2208 HomP (M, M) the identity natural transformation.\nLet I \u2208 P be the identity functor from Vk to Vk and let k \u2208 P denote the constant\nfunctor with value k. Tensor products in Vk define a symmetric monoidal structure \u2297 on\nP, with unit k. The category P is abelian.\nLet M \u2208 P and V \u2208 Vk . By functoriality M(V) carries a polynomial action of the\nlinear algebraic group GL(V). We denote this representation by \u03c0M,V , or by \u03c0 when the\ncontext is clear:\n\u03c0M,V : GL(V) \u2192 GL(M(V)) .\n\nSimilarly, a morphism \u03c6 : M \u2192 N induces a GL(V)-equivariant map \u03c6V : M(V) \u2192 N(V).\nThus, evaluation on V yields a functor from P to Pol(GL(V)), the category of polynomial\nrepresentations of GL(V).\n\n4.2\n\nDegrees and weight spaces\n\nThe degree of a functor M \u2208 P is the upper bound of the degrees of the polynomials\nEndk (V) \u2192 Endk (M(V)) for V \u2208 Vk . For example, the functors of degree zero are\nprecisely the functors Vk \u2192 Vk which are isomorphic to constant functors. A functor\nM \u2208 P is homogeneous of degree d if all the polynomials Endk (V) \u2192 Endk (M(V)) are\nhomogeneous polynomials of degree d.\n6\n\n\fFor M \u2208 P, GL(k) acts on M(V) by the formula,\n\u03bb * m = \u03c0M,V (\u03bb1V )(m), for \u03bb \u2208 GL(k) and m \u2208 M(V) .\nThis action is a polynomial action of GL(k), so M(V) splits as a direct sum of weight\nspaces\nM\nM(V) =\nM(V)d ; ,\nd\u22650\n\nwhere\nM(V)d = {m \u2208 M(V) : \u03bb * m = \u03bbd m} .\nMoreover, if f : V \u2192 W is a linear map, it commutes with homotheties, so M(f) is GL(k)equivariant. Hence M(f) preserves weight spaces, and we denote by M(f)d its restriction\nto the d-th weight spaces.\nSo we can define a strict polynomial functor Md by letting\nMd (V) = M(V)d , Md (f) = M(f)d ; .\nA routine check shows that Md is homogeneous of degree d. Thus, any functor M\ndecomposes as a finite direct sum of homogeneous functors Md of degree d. Similarly, a\nmorphism \u03c6 : M \u2192 N between strict polynomial functors preserves weight spaces. So it\ndecomposes as a direct sum of morphisms of homogeneous functors \u03c6d : Md \u2192 Nd . This\ncan be formulated by saying that the category P is the direct sum of its subcategories\nPd of homogeneous functors of degree d:\nM\nP=\nPd .\n(6)\nd\u22650\n\nIf M \u2208 P, we define its Kuhn dual M\u266f \u2208 P by M\u266f (V) = M(V \u2217 )\u2217 , where '\u2217' refers\nto k-linear duality in the category of vector spaces. Since (M\u266f )\u266f \u2243 M, duality yields an\nequivalence of categories [FS, Prop 2.6]:\n\u266f\n\n\u2243\n\n:P\u2212\n\u2192 P op .\n\nA routine check shows that \u266f respect degrees, i.e. M\u266f is homogeneous of degree d if and\nonly if M also is.\nThe following theorem, due to Friedlander and Suslin [FS], shows the categories Pd\nare a model for the stable categories of homogeneous polynomial GLn (k)-modules of\ndegree d. Let Pold (GL(V)) denote the category of polynomial representations of GL(V)\nof degree d.\nTheorem 4.2. Let V \u2208 Vk be a k-vector space of dimension n \u2265 d. The functor induced\nby evaluation on V:\nPd \u2192 Pold (GL(V)),\n\nis an equivalence of categories.\n\nAs a consequence of Theorem 4.2, we obtain that strict polynomial functors are\nnoetherian objects.\n7\n\n\fCorollary 4.3. Let M \u2208 P. Assume that you have an increasing sequence of subfunctors\nof M:\nM0 \u2282 M1 \u2282 * * * \u2282 Mi \u2282 . . . .\nThen there exists an integer N such that for all n \u2265 N, Mn = MN .\nRemark 4.4. Let \u2297d denote the d-th tensor product functor, which sends V \u2208 Vk to\nV \u2297d \u2208 Vk . Then \u2297d \u2208 Pd . Let \u03bb be a tuple of nonnegative integers summing to d, and\nlet S\u03bb \u2282 Sd denote the associated Young subgroup. We denote by \u0393 \u03bb the subfunctor\nof \u2297d defined by \u0393 \u03bb (V) = (V \u2297d )S\u03bb . It is proved in [FS] that the functors \u0393 \u03bb , \u03bb \u2208 \u2118 a\npartition of d, form a (projective) generator of Pd . In other words, the objects M \u2208 Pd\nare exactly the functors M : Vk \u2192 Vk which can be obtained as subquotients of a direct\nsum of a finite number of copies of the d-th tensor product functor \u2297d .\n\n4.3\n\nRecollections of Schur and Weyl functors\n\nIn this section we introduce Schur functors and Weyl functors. These strict polynomial\nfunctors are the functorial version of the Schur modules and the Weyl modules, and they\nwere first defined in [ABW].\nLet \u2118d denote the partitions of d. For \u03bb \u2208 \u2118d let \u03bb\u25e6 denote the conjugate partition.\nWe define a map d\u03bb as the composite:\n\u25e6\n\n\u03c3\n\n\u25e6\n\n\u03bb\nd\u03bb : \u039b\u03bb1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 \u039b\u03bbn \u0592\u2192 \u2297d \u2212\u2192\n\u2297d \u0589 S\u03bb1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 S\u03bbm .\n\nHere the first map is the canonical inclusion and the last one is the canonical epimorphism.\nThe middle map is the isomorphism of \u2297d which maps v1 \u2297 * * * vd onto v\u03c3\u03bb (1) \u2297 * * *\u2297 v\u03c3\u03bb (d) ,\nwhere \u03c3\u03bb \u2208 Sd is the permutation defined as follows. Let t\u03bb be the Young tableaux with\nstandard filling: 1, ..., \u03bb1 in the first row, \u03bb1 +1, ..., \u03bb2 in the second row, and so forth. Then\n\u03c3\u03bb , in one-line notation, is the row-reading of the conjugate tableaux t\u25e6\u03bb . For example, if\n\u03bb = (3, 1), then, \u03c3\u03bb = 1423, the permutation mapping 1 7\u2192 1, 2 7\u2192 4, 3 7\u2192 2, and 4 7\u2192 3.\n\nDefinition 4.5. Let \u03bb \u2208 \u2118d .\n\n1. The Schur functor S\u03bb \u2208 Pd is the image of d\u03bb .\n2. The Weyl functor W\u03bb is defined by duality W\u03bb := S\u266f\u03bb .\n3. Let L\u03bb be the socle of the functor S\u03bb .\nRemark 4.6. In [ABW, def. II.1.3], Schur functors are defined in the more general setting\nof 'skew partitions' \u03bb/\u03b1, (i.e. pairs of partitions (\u03bb, \u03b1) with \u03b1 \u2282 \u03bb), and over arbitrary\ncommutative rings. They denote Schur functors by L\u03bb\u25e6 , but we prefer to reserve this\nnotation for simple objects in Pd .\nThe following statement makes the link between Schur functors and induced modules\n(also called costandard modules, or Schur modules) and between Weyl functors and Weyl\nmodules (also called standard modules or Verma modules).\nProposition 4.7. Let \u03bb \u2208 \u2118d .\n\n8\n\n\f(i) There is an isomorphism of GL(kn )-modules S\u03bb (kn ) \u2243 H0 (\u03bb), where H0 (\u03bb) =\nGL(kn ) \u03bb\nindB\u2212\n(k ) is the induced module from [J, II.2].\n(ii) There is an isomorphism of GL(kn )-modules W\u03bb (kn ) \u2243 V(\u03bb), where\nV(\u03bb) = H0 (\u2212w0 \u03bb)\u2217\nis the Weyl module from [J, II.2].\nProof. We observe that (ii) follows from (i). Indeed, we know that V(\u03bb) is the transpose\ndual of H0 (\u03bb), and evaluation on kn changes the duality \u266f in P into the transpose duality.\nTo prove (ii), we refer to [Mar]. The Schur module M(\u03bb) defined in [Mar, Def 3.2.1] is\nisomorphic to H0 (\u03bb) (this is a theorem of James, cf. [Mar, Thm 3.2.6]). Now, using the\nembedding of M(\u03bb) into S\u03bb1 (kn ) \u2297 * * * \u2297 S\u03bbm (kn ) of [Mar, Example (1) p.73], and [ABW,\nThm II.2.16], we get an isomorphism S\u03bb (kn ) \u2243 M(\u03bb).\nThe following portemanteau theorem collects some of the most important properties\nof the functors S\u03bb , W\u03bb , L\u03bb , \u03bb \u2208 \u2118d .\nTheorem 4.8. (i) The functors L\u03bb , \u03bb \u2208 \u2118d form a complete set of representatives for\nthe isomorphism classes of irreducible functors of Pd .\n(ii) Irreducible functors are self dual: for all \u03bb \u2208 \u2118d , L\u266f\u03bb \u2243 L\u03bb .\n(iii) For all \u03bb \u2208 \u2118d , the L\u03bc which appear as composition factors in S\u03bb satisfy \u03bc \u2264 \u03bb,\nwhere \u2264 denotes the lexicographic order. Moreover, the multiplicity of L\u03bb in S\u03bb is\none.\n(iv) For all \u03bb, \u03bc \u2208 \u2118d ,\nk if \u03bb = \u03bc and i = 0,\n0 otherwise.\n\nExtiP (W\u03bc , S\u03bb ) =\n\nProof. All these statements have functorial proofs, but for sake of brevity we shall use\nproposition 4.7, together with the fact that evaluation on V for dim V \u2265 d is an equivalence of categories. Thus, (i) follows from [Mar, Thm. 3.4.2], (ii) follows from [Mar,\nThm. 3.4.9], (iii) follows from [Mar, Thm. 3.4.1(iii)]. Finally, (iv) follows from [J, Prop.\n4.13] and [FS, Cor. 3.13].\nCorollary 4.9. The equivalence classes of the Weyl functors [W\u03bb ] for \u03bb \u2208 \u2118 form a basis\nof K(P).\nProof. Order \u2118 by the lexicographic order, denoted \u2264. By parts (ii) and (iii) of Theorem 4.8, the multiplicity of L\u03bb in W\u03bb is one, and all other simple objects appearing as\ncomposition factors in W\u03bb are isomorphic to L\u03bc , where \u03bc \u2264 \u03bb. Form the matrix of the\nmap given by [L\u03bb ] 7\u2192 [W\u03bb ] in the basis [L\u03bb ]\u03bb\u2208\u2118 (ordered by \u2264). This is a lower triangular\nmatrix, with 1's on the diagonal. Hence it is invertible and we obtain the result.\nCorollary 4.10. The map K(P) \u2192 K(P) given by [M] 7\u2192 [M\u266f ] is the identity. In\nparticular, for all \u03bb \u2208 \u2118, [W\u03bb ] = [S\u03bb ].\nProof. By Theorem 4.8(ii) simple functors are self-dual. Whence the result.\n9\n\n\f4.4\n\nPolynomial bifunctors\n\nWe shall also need the category P [2] of strict polynomial bi-functors. The objects of P [2]\nare functors B : Vk \u00d7 Vk \u2192 Vk such that for every V \u2208 Vk , the functors B(*, V) and B(V, *)\nare in P and their degrees are bounded with respect to V. Morphisms in P [2] are natural\ntransformations of functors. The following example will be of particular interest to us.\nExample 4.11. Let M \u2208 P. We denote by M[2] the bifunctor:\nM[2] : Vk \u00d7 Vk \u2192\nVk\n(V, W) 7\u2192 M(V \u2295 W) .\n(f, g) 7\u2192 M(f \u2295 g)\n\nMapping M to M[2] yields a functor: P \u2192 P [2] .\n\nIf B \u2208 P [2] and (V, W) is a pair of vector spaces, then functoriality endows B(V, W)\nwith a polynomial GL(V) \u00d7 GL(W)-action, which we denote by \u03c0B,V,W (or simply by \u03c0 if\nthe context is clear):\n\u03c0B,V,W : GL(V) \u00d7 GL(W) \u2192 GL(B(V, W)) .\n\nEvaluation on a pair (V, W) of vector spaces yields a functor from P [2] to Reppol (GL(V) \u00d7\nGL(W)).\nA bifunctor B is homogeneous of bidegree (d, e) if for all V \u2208 Vk , B(V, *) (resp. B(*, V))\nis a homogeneous strict polynomial functor of degree d, (resp. of degree e). The decomposition of strict polynomial functors into a finite direct sums of homogeneous functors\ngeneralizes to bifunctors. Indeed, if B \u2208 P [2] the vector space B(V, W) is endowed with a\npolynomial action of GL(k) \u00d7 GL(k) defined by:\n(\u03bb, \u03bc) * m = \u03c0B,V,W (\u03bb1V , \u03bc1W )(m) ,\nand pairs of linear maps (f, g) induce GL(k) \u00d7 GL(k)-equivariant morphisms B(f, g). So\nfor i, j \u2265 0 we can use the (i, j) weight spaces with respect to the action of GL(k) \u00d7 GL(k)\nto define bifunctors Bi,j , namely\nBi,j (V, W) = {m \u2208 B(V, W) : (\u03bb, \u03bc) * m = \u03bbi \u03bcj m}\nand Bi,j (f, g) is the restriction of B(f, g) to the (i, j)-weight spaces. Functors Bi,j are\nhomogenous of bidegree (i, j) and P [2] splits as the direct sum of its full subcategories\n[2]\nPi,j of homogeneous bifunctors of bidegree (i, j). If B \u2208 P [2] , we denote by B\u2217,j the direct\nsum:\nM\nB\u2217,j =\nBi,j\n(7)\ni\u22650\n\nNote that we have also a duality for bifunctors\n\u266f\n\n\u2243\n\n\u2192 P [2] op\n: P [2] \u2212\n\nwhich sends B to B\u266f , with B\u266f (V, W) = B(V \u2217 , W \u2217 )\u2217 , and which respects the bidegrees.\n10\n\n\fThe generalization of these ideas to the category of strict polynomial tri-functors of\nfinite degree P [3] , which contains the tri-functors M[3] : (U, V, W) 7\u2192 M(U \u2295 V \u2295 W), and\nso on, is straight-forward.\nWe conclude this section by introducing a construction of new functors in P from\nold ones that will be used in the next section. Let M \u2208 P and consider the functor\nM[2] (*, k) \u2208 P. By (7) we have a decomposition\nM [2]\nM[2] (*, k) =\nM\u2217,i (*, k).\ni\u22650\n\n[2]\n\nIn other words, M\u2217,i (V, k) is the subspace of weight i of M(V \u2295 k) acted on by GL(k) via\nthe composition\n\u03c0M,V\u2295k\n\nGL(k) = 1V \u00d7 GL(k) \u0592\u2192 GL(V \u2295 k) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 GL(M(V \u2295 k)) .\n\nSince evaluation on V \u2295 k as well as taking weight spaces are exact, the assignment\n[2]\nM 7\u2192 M\u2217,i (*, k) defines an exact endo-functor on P.\n\n5\n\nCategorification Data\n\nHaving defined the notion of g-categorification and the category P, we are now ready\nto begin the task of defining a g-categorification on P. The present section is devoted\nto introducing the necessary data to construct the categorification (cf. items (1)-(3) of\nDefinition 3.3. The following section will be devoted to showing that this data satisfies\nthe required properties (cf. items (4)-(8) of Definition 3.3).\n\n5.1\n\nThe functors E and F\n\nDefine E, F : P \u2192 P by\n\n[2]\n\nE(M) = M\u2217,1 (*, k)\nF(M) = M \u2297 I\n\nfor M \u2208 P. These are exact functors (F is clearly exact; for the exactness of E see the\nlast paragraph of Section 4.4). We prove that E and F are bi-adjoint.\nProposition 5.1. The pair (F, E) is an adjoint pair, i.e. we have an isomorphism,\nnatural with respect to M, N \u2208 P:\n\u03b2 : HomP (F(M), N) \u2243 HomP (M, E(N)) .\nProof. We shall use the category P [2] of strict polynomial bifunctors. There are functors:\n\u22a0 : P \u00d7 P \u2192 P [2]\n\n\u2297:P \u00d7P \u2192P\n\n\u2206 : P [2] \u2192 P\n\n[2]\n\n11\n\n: P \u2192 P [2]\n\n\frespectively given by\nM \u22a0 N(V, W) = M(V) \u2297 N(W)\n\nM \u2297 N(V) = M(V) \u2297 N(V)\n\n\u2206B(V) = B(V, V)\n\nM[2] (V, W) = M(V \u2295 W)\n\nWe observe that \u2206(M \u22a0 N) = M \u2297 N. Moreover, we know (cf. [FFSS, Proof of Thm 1.7]\nor [T1, Lm 5.8]) that \u2206 and [2] are bi-adjoint.\nNow we are ready to prove the adjunction isomorphism. We have the following natural\nisomorphisms:\nHomP (F(M), N) = HomP (M \u2297 I, N)\n\u2243 HomP [2] (M \u22a0 I, N[2] )\n\u2243 HomP (M(*), HomP (I(\u2217), N(* \u2295 \u2217)))\nHere HomP (I(\u2217), N(* \u2295 \u2217)) denotes the polynomial functor which assigns to V \u2208 Vk\nthe vector space HomP (I, N(V \u2295 \u2217)). By Yoneda's Lemma [FS, Thm 2.10], for any\nF \u2208 P, HomP (I, F) \u2243 F(k) if F is of degree one, and zero otherwise. In particular,\nHomP (I, N(V \u2295 \u2217)) \u2243 N(V \u2295 k)1 = E(N)(V). Hence, HomP (I(\u2217), N(* \u2295 \u2217)) \u2243 E(N) and\nwe conclude that there is a natural isomorphism:\nHomP (F(M), N) \u2243 HomP (M, E(N)).\n\nWe are now going to derive the adjunction (E, F) from proposition 5.1 and a duality\nargument. The following lemma is an easy check.\nLemma 5.2. For all M \u2208 P, we have isomorphisms, natural with respect to M:\nF(M)\u266f \u2243 F(M\u266f ) , E(M)\u266f \u2243 E(M\u266f ) .\nProof. We have an isomorphism:\nF(M)\u266f = (M \u2297 I)\u266f \u2243 M\u266f \u2297 I\u266f = F(M\u266f ) ,\nand a chain of isomorphisms:\n\u0001\u266f\n[2]\n[2]\nE(M)\u266f = M\u2217,1 (*, k) \u2243 (M\u2217,1 )\u266f (*, k)\n\n\u2243 (M[2] \u266f )\u2217,1 (*, k)\n[2]\n\n\u2243 (M\u266f )\u2217,1 (*, k) = E(M\u266f ) .\nIn the chain of isomorphisms, the first isomorphism follows from the isomorphism of vector\nspaces k\u2228 \u2243 k, the second follows from the fact that duality preserves bidegrees, and the\nlast one from the fact that duality of vector spaces commutes with direct sums.\nProposition 5.3. The pair (E, F) is an adjoint pair, i.e. we have an isomorphism,\nnatural with respect to M, N \u2208 P:\n\u03b1 : HomP (E(M), N) \u2243 HomP (M, F(N)) .\n12\n\n\fProof. The adjunction isomorphism of proposition 5.3 is defined as the composite of the\nnatural isomorphisms:\nHomP (E(M), N) \u2243 HomP (N\u266f , E(M)\u266f ) \u2243 HomP (N\u266f , E(M\u266f ))\n\u2243 HomP (F(N\u266f ), M\u266f ) \u2243 HomP (F(N)\u266f , M\u266f ) \u2243 HomP (M, F(N)) .\n\n5.2\n\nThe operators X and T\n\nWe first introduce the natural transformation X : E \u2192 E. We assume that p 6= 2.\nFor any V \u2208 Vk , let U(gl(V \u2295 k)) denote the envelopingL\nalgebra of gl(V \u2295 k), and let\nXV \u2208 U(gl(V \u2295 k)) be defined as follows. Fix a basis V = ni=1 kei ; this choice induces a\nbasis of V \u2295 k. Let xi,j \u2208 gl(V \u2295 k) be the operator mapping ej to ei and el to zero for\nall l 6= j. Then define\nn\nX\nXV =\nxn+1,i xi,n+1 \u2212 n.\ni=1\n\nThe element XV does not depend on the choice of basis. Indeed, let CV \u2208 U(gl(V)) denote\nthe Casimir operator:\nn\nX\nX\nCV =\nx2l,l .\n(8)\nxi,j xj,i +\ni6=j\n\nl=1\n\nIt's well known that CV does not depend on the choice of basis of V, and one computes\n(see Lemma 3.27 in [HY])\nCV\u2295k \u2212 CV = 2XV +\n\nn\nX\n\nxi,i \u2212 nxn+1,n+1 + x2n+1,n+1 + 2n.\n\n(9)\n\ni=1\n\n(Note this is where the hypothesis p 6= 2 is used.) Therefore XV also does not depend on\nthe choice of basis of V.\nThe group GL(V) \u00d7 GL(k) \u2282 GL(V \u2295 k) acts on the Lie algebra gl(V \u2295 k) by the\nadjoint action, hence on the algebra U(gl(V \u2295 k). By (9) we have:\nLemma 5.4. Let V \u2208 Vk . Then XV commutes with GL(V) \u00d7 GL(k), i.e.\nXV \u2208 U(gl(V \u2295 k))GL(V)\u00d7GL(k) .\nThe universal enveloping algebra U(gl(V \u2295 k)) acts on M(V \u2295 k) via differentiation:\nd\u03c0M,V : U(gl(V \u2295 k)) \u2192 End(M(V \u2295 k)).\n\nExample 5.5. If M = I is the identity functor of Vk , and f \u2208 gl(V \u2295k), then d\u03c0I,V\u2295k (f) =\nf. More generally, if d \u2265 2 and M = \u2297d is the d-th tensor product, then d\u03c0\u2297d ,V\u2295k sends\nf \u2208 gl(V \u2295 k) onto the the element\nd\nX\n(1V\u2295k )\u2297i\u22121 \u2297 f \u2297 (1V\u2295k )\u2297d\u2212i\ni=1\n\n13\n\n\u2208 End((V \u2295 k)\u2297d ) .\n\n\fThe element XV acts on the vector space M(V \u2295 k) via d\u03c0M,V , and we denote by XM,V\nthe induced k-linear map:\nXM,V : M(V \u2295 k) \u2192 M(V \u2295 k) .\n\nBy Lemma 5.4, XM,V is GL(V) \u00d7 GL(k)-equivariant. Thus, it restricts to the subspaces\nE(M)(V) of weight 1 under the action of {1V } \u00d7 GL(k). We denote the resulting map also\nby XM,V :\nXM,V : E(M)(V) \u2192 E(M)(V).\n\nProposition 5.6. The linear maps XM,V : E(M)(V) \u2192 E(M)(V) are natural with respect\nto M and V. Hence they define a morphism of functors\nX : E \u2192 E.\n\nProof. The action of U(gl(V \u2295 k)) on M(V \u2295 k) is natural with respect to M. Hence the\nk-linear maps XM,V are natural with respect to M.\nSo it remains to check the naturality with respect to V \u2208 Vk . For this, it suffices to\ncheck that for all M \u2208 P, and for all f \u2208 Hom(V, W), diagram (D) below is commutative.\nM(f\u22951k )\n\nM(V \u2295 k)\n\n/ M(W \u2295 k)\n\nXV,M\n\n(D)\n\nXW,M\n\n\u000f\n\nM(f\u22951k )\n\nM(V \u2295 k)\n\n\u000f\n/ M(W \u2295 k)\n\nWe observe that if diagram (D) commutes for a given strict polynomial functor M,\nthen by naturality with respect to M, it also commutes for direct sums M\u2295n , for n \u2265 1,\nfor the subfunctors N \u2282 M and the quotients M \u0589 N. But as we already explained in\nremark 4.4, every functor M \u2208 P is a subquotient of a finite direct sum of copies of the\ntensor product functors \u2297d , for d \u2265 0. Thus, to prove naturality with respect to V, it\nsuffices to check that diagram (D) commutes for M = \u2297d for all d \u2265 0.\nIn the case of the tensor products \u2297d the action of U(gl(V \u2295 k) is explicitly given in\nexample 5.5. Using this expression, a straightforward computation shows that diagram\n(D) is commutative in this case. This finishes the proof.\nWe next introduce a natural transformation T : E2 \u2192 E2 . Let M \u2208 P and V \u2208 Vk .\nBy definition,\n[3]\nE2 (M) = M\u2217,1,1 (*, k, k).\nConsider the map 1V \u2295 \u03c3 : V \u2295 k \u2295 k \u2192 V \u2295 k \u2295 k given by: (v, a, b) 7\u2192 (v, b, a). Applying\nM[3] to this map we obtain a morphism:\n[3]\n\n[3]\n\nTM,V : M\u2217,1,1 (V, k, k) \u2192 M\u2217,1,1 (V, k, k).\n\nLemma 5.7. The linear maps TM,V : E2 (M)(V) \u2192 E2 (M)(V) are natural with respect\nto M and V. Hence they define a morphism of functors\nT : E2 \u2192 E2 .\n14\n\n\fProof. Clearly the maps TM,V are natural with respect to M. Let f : V \u2192 W be a linear\noperator of vector spaces. We need to show that the following diagram commutes:\nE2 (M)(V)\n\nE2 (M)(f)\n\n/ E2 (M)(W)\n\nTM,V\n\nTM,W\n\n\u000f\n\nE2 (M)(V)\n\n\u000f\nE2 (M)(f)\n\n/ E2 (M)(W)\n\nOn the one hand, E2 (M)(f) is the restriction of M[3] (f\u22951k \u22951k ) to the tri-degrees (\u2217, 1, 1).\nOn the other hand, TM,V is the restriction of M[3] (1V \u2295\u03c3) to the tri-degrees (\u2217, 1, 1). Since\nf \u2295 1k \u2295 1k clearly commutes with 1V \u2295 \u03c3, the above diagram commutes.\n\n5.3\n\nThe weight decomposition of P\n\nAs part of the data of g-categorification, we need to introduce a decomposition of P\nindexed by the weight lattice P of g. In this section we define such a decomposition via\nthe blocks of P.\nWe begin by recalling some combinatorial notions. For a nonnegative integer d, let\n\u2118d denote the set of partitions of d. A partition \u03bb is a p-core if there exist no \u03bc \u2282 \u03bb such\nthat the skew-partition \u03bb/\u03bc is a rim p-hook. By definition, if p = 0 then all partitions\nare p-cores. Given a partition \u03bb, we denote by \u03bb\u0303 the p-core obtained by successively\nremoving all rim p-hooks. The p-weight of \u03bb is by definition the number (|\u03bb| \u2212 |\u03bb\u0303|)/p.\nThe notation |\u03bb| denotes the size of the partition \u03bb. Define an equivalence relation \u223c on\n\u2118d by decreeing \u03bb \u223c \u03bc if \u03bb\u0303 = \u03bc\u0303.\nLet \u03bb, \u03bc \u2208 \u2118d . As a consequence of (11.6) in [Kl] we have\n\u03bb\u0303 = \u03bc\u0303 \u21d0\u21d2 wt(\u03bb) = wt(\u03bc).\n\n(10)\n\n(See (1) for the definition of wt(\u03bb).) Therefore we index the set of equivalence classes\n\u2118d / \u223c by weights in P, i.e. a weight \u03c9 \u2208 P corresponds to a subset (possibly empty) of\n\u2118d .\nLet IrrPd denote the set of simple objects in Pd up to isomorphism. This set is\nnaturally identified with \u2118d . We say two simple objects in Pd are adjacent if they occur\nas composition factors of some indecomposable object in Pd . Consider the equivalence\nrelation \u2248 on IrrPd generated by adjacency. Via the identification of IrrPd with \u2118d we\nobtain an equivalence relation \u2248 on \u2118d .\nTheorem 5.8 (Theorem 2.12, [D]). The equivalence relations \u223c and \u2248 on \u2118d are the\nsame.\nGiven an equivalence class \u0398 \u2208 IrrPd / \u2248, the corresponding block P\u0398 \u2282 Pd is the\nsubcategory of objectsLwhose composition factors belong to \u0398. The block decomposition\nof P is given by P =\nP\u0398 , where \u0398 ranges over all classes in IrrPd / \u2248 and d \u2265 0.\nBy the above theorem and Equation (10), we can label the blocks of Pd by weights\n\u03c9 \u2208 P. Moreover, by Equation (1), wt(\u03bb) determines the size of \u03bb. Therefore the block\ndecomposition of P can be expressed as:\nM\nP=\nP\u03c9 .\n\u03c9\u2208P\n\n15\n\n\fThe p-weight of a block P\u03c9 is the p-weight of \u03bb, where \u03c9 = wt(\u03bb). This is well-defined\nsince if wt(\u03bb) = wt(\u03bc) then |\u03bb| = |\u03bc| and \u03bb\u0303 = \u03bc\u0303, and hence the p-weights of \u03bb and \u03bc\nagree.\n\n6\n\nCategorification of Fock space\n\nIn the previous section we defined all the data necessary to formulate the action g on P.\nIn this section we prove the main theorem:\nTheorem 6.1. Suppose p 6= 2. The category P along with the data of adjoint functors\n2\nE\nL and F, operators X \u2208 End(E) and T \u2208 End(E ), and the weight decomposition P =\n\u03c9\u2208P P\u03c9 defines a g-categorification which categorifies the Fock space representation of\ng.\nRemark 6.2. The theorem is still true for p = 2. We only include this hypothesis for\nease of exposition (one can prove the p = 2 case using hyperalgebras instead of enveloping\nalgebras).\nTo prove this theorem we must show that the data satisfies properties (4)-(6), (8) of\nDefinition 3.3, and that the resulting representation of g on K(P) is isomorphic to the\nFock space representation (property (7) already appears as Proposition 5.1).\n\n6.1\n\nThe functors Ei\n\nIn this section we prove property (4) of Definition 3.3. For all a \u2208 k, and M \u2208 P we can\nform a nested collection of subspaces of E(M), natural with respect to M:\n0 \u2282 Ea,1 (M) \u2282 Ea,2 (M) \u2282 * * * \u2282 Ea,n (M) \u2282 * * * \u2282 E(M) ,\nwhere Ea,n (M) is the kernel of (XM \u2212 a)n : E(M) \u2192 E(M). We define:\n[\nEa,n (M) .\nEa (M) =\nn\u22650\n\nSince the inclusions Ea,n (M) \u2282 Ea,n+1 (M) are natural with respect to M, the assignment\nM 7\u2192 Ea (M) defines a sub-endofunctor of E.\nLemma 6.3. The endofunctor E : P \u2192 P splits as a direct sum of its subfunctors Ea :\nM\nE=\nEa .\na\u2208k\n\nMoreover, for all M \u2208 P there exists an integer N such that for all n \u2265 N, Ea (M) =\nEa,n (M).\nProof. The decomposition as a direct summand of generalized eigenspaces is standard\nlinear algebra. The finiteness of the filtration (Ea,n (M))n\u22650 follows from Corollary 4.3.\nProposition 6.4. Let \u03bb \u2208 \u2118 be a partition of d and set W = W\u03bb .\n16\n\n\f1. The polynomial functor E(W) carries a Weyl filtration:\n0 = E(W)0 \u2282 E(W)1 \u2282 * * * \u2282 E(W)N = E(W).\nThe composition factors which occur in this filtration are isomorphic to W\u03bc for all\n\u03bc such that \u03bc \u2212\u2192 \u03bb and each such factor occurs exactly once.\n2. The operator XW : E(W) \u2192 E(W) preserves the filtration of E(W), and hence it\nacts on the associated graded object.\n3. Given 0 \u2264 i \u2264 N \u2212 1, set j \u2208 Z/pZ and \u03bc \u2208 \u2118 such that E(W)i+1 /E(W)i \u2243 W\u03bc ,\nj\n\nand \u03bc \u2212\n\u2192 \u03bb. Then XW acts on E(W)i+1 /E(W)i by multiplication by j.\n\nIn particular Ea = 0 for a 6\u2208 Z/pZ, and hence\nM\nEi .\nE=\ni\u2208Z/pZ\n\n[2]\n\nProof. Theorem\nL II.4.11 of [ABW] yields a filtration of the bifunctor S\u03bb with associated\ngraded object \u03b1\u2282\u03bb S\u03b1 \u22a0 S\u03bb/\u03b1 . Here, S\u03bb/\u03b1 \u2208 P|\u03bb|\u2212|\u03b1| refers to the Schur functor associated\nto the skew partition \u03bb/\u03b1 and S\u03b1 \u22a0S\u03bb/\u03b1 is the homogeneous bifunctor of bidegree (|\u03b1|, |\u03bb|\u2212\n[2]\n\n|\u03b1|), defined by (V, U) 7\u2192 S\u03b1 (V) \u2297 S\u03bb/\u03b1 (U). Thus, (S\u03bb )\u2217,1 has a filtration whose graded\nobject is the sum of the S\u03b1 \u22a0 S\u03bb/\u03b1 with |\u03bb| = |\u03b1| + 1. In this case, S\u03bb/\u03b1 is the identity\nfunctor ofL\nVk by definition. Thus, taking U = k, we get a filtration of E(S\u03bb ) whose graded\nobject is\nS\u03b1 , for all \u03b1 \u2192 \u03bb. The first part of the proposition follows by duality \u266f . (For\nan alternative proof based on [Mar] and [GW, Thm. 8.1.1], see [HY, Lemma A.3].)\nFor any V \u2208 Vk , by (9) the map XW,V preserves the filtration of GL(V)-modules:\n0 = E(W)0 (V) \u2282 E(W)1 (V) \u2282 * * * \u2282 E(W)N (V) = E(W)(V).\nIndeed, since Weyl modules are highest weight modules, CV\u2295k acts on W(V \u2295k) by scalar,\nand CV acts on the factors of the filtration by scalar as well. Therefore XW preserves the\nfiltration of E(W), proving the second part of the proposition.\nFinally, let \u03bc and j be chosen as in the third part of the proposition. By Lemma\n5.7(1) in [HY], for any V \u2208 Vk , XW,V acts by j on E(W)i+1 (V)/E(W)i (V). Therefore XW\nacts on E(W)i+1 /E(W)i also by j.\nBy the adjunction of E and F and the Yoneda Lemma, the operator X \u2208 End(E)\ninduces an operator X\u25e6 \u2208 End(F). The generalized eigenspaces of this operator produce\nsubfunctors Fa of F, which, by general nonsense, are adjoint to Ea . Therefore we have\ndecompositions\nM\nM\nE=\nEi , F =\nFi .\ni\u2208Z/pZ\n\ni\u2208Z/pZ\n\n17\n\n\f6.2\n\nThe action of g on K(P)\n\nIn this section we prove property (5) of Definition 3.3. The functors Ei , Fi , being exact\nfunctors, induce linear operators\n[Ei ], [Fi ] : K(P) \u2192 K(P)\n\nfor all i \u2208 Z/pZ. Define a map \u03ba : g \u2192 End(K(P)) by ei 7\u2192 [Ei ] and fi 7\u2192 [Fi ]. Let\n\u03a8 : K(P) \u2192 B be given by \u03a8([W\u03bb ]) = v\u03bb .\n\nProposition 6.5. The map \u03ba is a representation of g and \u03a8 is an isomorphism of gmodules.\nProof. By Corollary 4.9 \u03a8 is a linear isomorphism. By Proposition 6.4,\nX\n[Ei ]([W\u03bb ]) =\n[W\u03bc ].\n\u03bc\n\ni\n\n/\u03bb\n\nTherefore \u03a8 intertwines the operators ei and [Ei ], i.e. \u03a8 \u25e6 [Ei ] = ei \u25e6 \u03a8. Consider the\nbilinear form on K(P) given by:\nX\nhM, Ni =\n(\u22121)i dimExti (M, N)\ni\u22650\n\nBy adjunction [Ei ] and [Fi ] are adjoint operators with respect to h*, *i, and by Theorem\n4.8(iv), hW\u03bb , S\u03bc i = \u03b4\u03bb\u03bc . Therefore\nX\n[S\u03bc ].\n[Fi ]([S\u03bb ]) =\n\u03bb\n\ni\n\n/\u03bc\n\nHence, by Corollary 4.10, \u03a8 also intertwines the operators fi and [Fi ]. Both claims of the\nproposition immediately follow.\n\n6.3\n\nChevalley functors and weight decomposition of P\n\nIn this section we prove property (6) of Definition 3.3.\nProposition 6.6. Let \u03c9 \u2208 P. For every i \u2208 Z/pZ, the functors Ei , Fi : P \u2192 P restrict\nto Ei : P\u03c9 \u2192 P\u03c9+\u03b1i and Fi : P\u03c9 \u2192 P\u03c9\u2212\u03b1i .\n\nProof. We prove that Ei (P\u03c9 ) \u2282 P\u03c9+\u03b1i (the proof for Fi being entirely analogous). Since\nEi is exact it suffices to prove that if L\u03bb \u2208 P\u03c9 then Ei (L\u03bb ) \u2208 P\u03c9+\u03b1i . Then, by the\nsame idea as used in the proof of Lemma 4.9, it suffices to show that if W\u03bb \u2208 P\u03c9 then\nEi (W\u03bb ) \u2208 P\u03c9+\u03b1i . By Proposition 6.4, Ei (W\u03bb ) has a Weyl filtration with factors all of\n\nthe form W\u03bc , where \u03bc\nEi (W\u03bb ) \u2208 P\u03c9+\u03b1i .\n\ni\n\n/ \u03bb . But then \u03bc \u2208 \u03c9 + \u03b1i , so W\u03bc \u2208 P\u03c9+\u03b1 . Therefore\ni\n\n18\n\n\f6.4\n\nThe degenerate affine Hecke algebra action on En\n\nIn this section we prove property (8) of Definition 3.3.\nProposition 6.7.

By definition, En (M)(V) is the subspace of M(V \u2295 kn ) formed by the vectors\nof weight \u031fn = (1, 1, . . . , 1) for the action of GL(k)\u00d7n . Here GL(k)\u00d7n acts via the\ncomposition:\n\u03c0M,V\u2295kn\n\nGL(k)\u00d7n = 1V \u00d7 GL(k)\u00d7n \u2282 GL(V \u2295 kn ) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 GL(M(V \u2295 kn )) .\n\nThe map (\u03c4n\u2212i )M,V is equal to the restriction of M(ti ) to En (M)(V), where ti :\nV \u2295 kn \u2192 V \u2295 kn maps (v, x1 , . . . , xn ) to (v, x1 , . . . , xi+1 , xi , . . . , xn ). To check that the\n\u03c4i define an action of ZSn on En , we need to check that the (\u03c4i )M,V define an action of\nthe symmetric group on En (M)(V). By Remark 4.4 it suffices to check this for M = \u2297d ,\nand this is a straightforward computation. Moreover, it is also straightforward from\nthe definition that the yi commute with each other. Thus they define an action of the\npolynomial algebra Z[y1 , . . . , yn ] on En . Similarly, \u03c4i and yj commute with each other if\n|i \u2212 j| \u2265 1.\nSo, to obtain the action of the Hecke algebra on End(En ), it remains to show that\n\u03c4i yi \u2212 yi+1 \u03c4i = 1 (see Remark 3.4). This will be proved by showing the following identity\nin End(E2 ):\nT \u25e6 EX \u2212 XE \u25e6 T = 1.\n(11)\nTo check (11), it suffices to check that for all M \u2208 P and all V \u2208 Vk ,\nTM,V \u25e6 E(XM )V \u2212 XE(M) \u25e6 TM,V = 1E2 (M)(V)\n\n(12)\n\nIf (12) holds for M \u2208 P, then by naturality with respect to M, it also holds for direct\nsums M\u2295n , for subfunctors N \u2282 M, and quotients M \u0589 N. By Remark 4.4, every\nfunctor M \u2208 P is a subquotient of a finite direct sum of copies of the tensor product\nfunctors \u2297d , for d \u2265 0. Thus, it suffices to check that Equation (12) holds for M = \u2297d\nfor all d \u2265 0.\nLet M = \u2297d and let V \u2208 Vk . Choose a basis (e1 , . . . , en ) of V. We naturally extend\nthis to a basis (e1 , . . . , en+2 ) of V \u2295 k \u2295 k. By definition, E2 (\u2297d )(V) is the subspace of\n(V \u2295k\u2295k)\u2297d spanned by the vectors of the form ei1 \u2297* * *\u2297eid , where exactly one of the eik\nequals en+1 and exactly one of the eik equals en+2 . Let us fix a vector \u03be = ei1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 eid\nwith en+1 in a-th position and en+2 in b-th position. We will show that Equation (12)\nholds for \u03be.\n\n19\n\n\fFirst note that TM,V (\u03be) = ei(ab)(1) \u2297* * *\u2297ei(ab)(d) , where (ab) denotes the transposition\nof Sd which exchanges a and b.

The main motivation for\nChuang and Rouquier's original work on categorification was to prove Broue's abelian\ndefect conjecture for the symmetric groups, which can be reduced to showing that any\ntwo blocks of symmetric groups of the same p-weight are derived equivalent [CR]. Their\ntechnique applies to the setting of sl2 -categorifications. Since for every simple root \u03b1 of\ng there is a corresponding root subalgebra of g isomorphic to sl2 , we've in fact defined a\nfamily of sl2 -categorifications on P. To each of these categorifications we can apply the\nChuang-Rouqueir machinery.\nLet W aff = Sp \u22c9 Q denote the affine Weyl group associated to g, acting on P in the\nusual way. By [Kac, Section 12], any weight \u03c9 appearing in the weight decomposition of\nFock space is of the form \u03c3(\u03c90 ) \u2212 l\u03b4, where \u03c3 \u2208 W aff and l \u2265 0. By Proposition 11.1.5\nin [Kl], l is exactly the p-weight of the corresponding block. Therefore the weights of any\ntwo blocks are conjugate by some element of affine Weyl group if and only if they have\nthe same p-weight. By Theorem 6.4 in [CR] we obtain\nTheorem 7.1. If two blocks of P have the same p-weight, then they are derived equivalent.\n\n20\n\n\f7.2\n\nMisra-Miwa crystal\n\nWe can also apply the theory of g-categorification to crystal basis theory. The crystal\nstructure is a combinatorial structure associated to integrable representations of KacMoody algebras, introduced originally by Kashiwara via the theory of quantum groups.\nFrom Kashiwara's theory one can construct a canonical basis for the corresponding representations, which agrees with Lustig's canonical basis of geometric origins.\nLoosely speaking, the crystal structure of an integrable representation of some KacMoody algebra consists of a set B in bijection with a basis of the representation, along\nwith Kashiwara operators \u1ebdi , f\u0303i on B indexed by the simple roots of the Kac-Moody\nalgebra, along with further data. For a precise definition see [Kas].\nFrom the g-categorification on P we can recover the crystal structure of Fock space\nas follows. For the set B we take IrrP \u2282 K(P), the set of equivalence classes of simple\nobjects. We construct Kashiwara operators on IrrP by composing the Chevalley functors\nwith the socle functor:\n\u1ebdi , f\u0303i = [socle \u25e6 Ei ], [socle \u25e6 Fi ] : IrrP \u2192 IrrP.\n\nThe other data defining a crystal structure can also be naturally obtained. In Section 5.3\nof [HY] it is shown that this data agrees with the crystal of B originally discovered by\nMisra and Miwa [MM].\n\nReferences\n[ABW] K. Akin, D.A. Buchsbaum, J.
