While the\noptical, radio, and gamma-ray emissions originating from the pulsar and nebula vary only a few percent (the\nnebula is used as a standard candle), four most powerful flare episodes (with flux increases up to a factor\nof 6 times the background) have recently been discovered with the AGILE satellite during October 2007\nand 19-21 September 2010 (Tavani et al. 2011, Abdo et al. 2011), and also by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space\nTelescope during February 2009 and April 2011 (Buehler et al. 2010).\nThe following are some of the puzzling features of the gamma-ray flares that have recently been detected\nin the Crab Nebula:\n1. The photon energies are extraordinarily high, in excess of 1 GeV, based on the gamma-ray emission\nobserved by AGILE in the energy range of 100 MeV \u2212 10 GeV (Tavani et al. 2011).\n2. The timescale is quite short for an event that occurs in the nebula - of the order of one day or less\n(Tavani et al. 2011, Balbo et al. 2011, Striani et al. 2011). The flares in February 2009 and September\n2010 lasted about 16 days and about 4 days (Abdo et al. 2011). The relative brevity of the flares\nsuggests gamma rays produced by gyrosynchrotron emission from \u2248 1015 eV (=PeV) electrons in a\nregion <\n\u223c 0.014 parsec (Abdo et al. 2011). The origin of variable multi-TeV gamma-ray emission from\nthe Crab nebula has been modeled in Komissarov and Lyutikov (2011) and Bednarek and Idec (2011).\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\n\n3. The spectrum rises steeply below the peak energy, which may be from 7 MeV to 3 GeV.\n4. As a result, there is no detection of soft or hard X-rays associated with the flares (Ferringo et al. 2010,\nMarkwardt et al. 2010).\nIn this paper we develop a theoretical model of the PeV acceleration region, in terms of twisted magnetic\nfields, which can explain the observed extreme flare parameters within the right order of magnitude.\n\n2.\n\nFlare and Particle Acceleration Model\n\nFor synchrotron radiation, the energy of the emitted photons (in eV) is given by,\nU\u03b3 = 10\u221220.5 Ue2 B ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere energies are measured in eV and magnetic fields strengths in Gauss.\nHence a photon of energy U\u03b3 = 1 GeV is produced by an electron of energy Ue = 1014.8 B \u22121/2 . If the\nmagnetic field strength is B = 1 Gauss or less, the electron energy will be 1015 eV or more. This raises two\nquestions concerning the acceleration mechanism:\n1. How are electrons accelerated so rapidly to such a high energy?\n2. Why is the electron spectrum so sharply peaked that it does not give rise to strong X-ray emission?\nThese puzzles suggest that we look for something different from the usual ideas of shock acceleration\nfollowed by ordinary synchrotron radiation. We suggest that the acceleration is due to a process that develops\na DC electric field parallel to the magnetic field, and that the radiation is due to the motion of electrons\nalong curved magnetic field lines. It appears that these two processes can occur as a consequence of the\nsudden development of resistivity in a localized region of a twisted magnetic flux tube.\nWe consider a pre-flare state that comprises a twisted flux tube held in place by a surrounding flux\nsystem. To bypass consideration of the termination of the tube, we suppose that it has the form of a toroid\nof major radius R and minor radius R1 . The mean magnetic field strength is B, and the mean electron\ndensity is n (cm\u22123 ).\nIf the mean value of the azimuthal or transverse magnetic field is B1 , then the total free magnetic energy\nis,\nW = 2\u03c0R\u03c0R12\n\n1 2\n2 2 3 2\nB = 10\u22120.1 kR\nkB R B .\n8\u03c0 1\n\n(2)\n\nwhere we write,\nR1 = kR R ,\n\nB1 = kB B .\n\n(3)\n\nNow suppose that an instability (probably a two-stream instability) occurs somewhere along the length of\nthe toroidal flux tube, and that the effect of this instability is equivalent to suddenly inserting a highly\nresistive sheet across the flux tube.\nIf n is the electron density, the relativistically correct expression for the Alfven speed is (Sturrock 1994)\n\u0013\u22121/2\n\u0012\n4\u03c0nmp\n1\n+\n,\n(4)\nvA =\nc2\nB2\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n\nwhere mp is the ion (proton or positron) mass. In subsequent calculations we assume that vA \u2248 c to adequate\napproximation.\nThe tube will begin to unwind, and the time it takes to unwind is\n2\u03c0R\n2\u03c0R\n=\n= 10\u22129.7 R .\nvA\nc\n\nT =\n\n(5)\n\nThe total energy release rate (the total luminosity) is given by,\nL=\n\nW\n2 2 2 2\n= 109.6 kR\nkB R B .\nT\n\n(6)\n\nThis process leads to an electric field parallel to the magnetic field. We estimate the magnitude of this field\nfrom\n1 \u2202B\n\u2207\u00d7E=\u2212\n,\n(7)\nc \u2202t\nwhere we use modified Gaussian units (electric units in esu, and magnetic units in emu). This leads to the\nestimate\nB1 R1\n\u2248 10\u22120.8 kR kB B .\n(8)\nE=\ncT\nThe maximum energy that can be imparted to an electron (one that travels the complete circuit) is\nUe,max = eE2\u03c0R = 10\u22129.3 kR kB RB .\n\n(9)\n\nHowever the actual energy of an electron is likely to be radiation reaction-limited. Electrons of energy Ue\n(eV) traveling along a field line with radius of curvature R will emit, by curvature radiation, photons of\nenergy (in eV)\nU\u03a6 = 10\u221222.2 Ue3 R\u22121 ,\n(10)\nand the rate of radiation of energy per electron is given by\nSe = 10\u221231.1 Ue4 R\u22122 .\n\n(11)\n\n(Note however that the energy released due to the change in the magnetic field could go into more than one\nform of energy - the energy converted to radiation, and the kinetic energy of the relaxed plasma. Any excess\nreleased energy could set up an oscillatory macroscopic motion of the plasma plus magnetic field.)\nOn equating the rate of energy input to the rate of energy output,\necE = 100.4 kR kB B = 10\u221231.1 Ue4 R\u22122 ,\n\n(12)\n\nwe arrive at the radiation reaction-limited electron energy (probably an estimate of the maximum electron\nenergy):\n1/4 1/4\n(13)\nUe,rr = 107.9 kR kB R1/2 B 1/4 .\nThis leads to the following estimate of the photon energy:\n3/4 3/4\n\nU\u03a6,rr = 101.5 kR kB R1/2 B 3/4 .\n\n(14)\n\nHowever (assuming that the electron energy is radiation-reaction-limited), the total luminosity is also expressible as\nL = (2\u03c0R\u03c0R12 f n) \u00d7 ecE ,\n(15)\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n\nwhere f is the fraction of the available electrons that are actually accelerated.\nThis is found to be\n3\nL = 101.7 kR\nkB f nR3 B .\n\n(16)\n\nOn comparing Eq. (16) with Eq. (6), we obtain the following estimate for f ,\n\u22121\nf = 107.9 kR\nkB n\u22121 R\u22121 B .\n\n(17)\n\nTo see if these formulas lead to reasonable estimates, we consider one of the flares that occurred in April\n2011, for which we have the following observational constraints:\n1. The time-scale was reported as \"hours\". We adopt 10 hours, so T = 104.6 .\n2. The peak energy of one of the flares was reported to be about 100 MeV so U\u03c6,rr = 108 eV.\n3. The luminosity was estimated to be L = 1036 erg s\u22121 .\nThen Eq. (5) leads to the radius R = 1014.3 cm. If we set kR = kB = k, then with this value of R, Eq. (6)\nleads to k 2 B = 10\u22121.1 , and Eq. (14) leads to k 2 B = 10\u22120.9 . It is interesting that we can satisfy both\nequations to good approximation by adopting k 2 B = 10\u22121 . Then k = 10\u22121 leads to B = 10 G, for instance.\nFor these values, Eq. (17) leads to f n = 10\u22125.4 . If n = 10\u22125 , then practically all of the electrons are\naccelerated; if n = 1, then only a small fraction are accelerated, etc.\nThere is really a lot of flexibility in these estimates, of course, but the above calculations show that the\nmodel can fit observational data with parameters that are not unreasonable.\nConcerning the luminosity, we should bear in mind that the radiation from any part of the toroid will\nbe sharply beamed. If the flux tube were strictly toroidal in form, the radiation would have a disk-like polar\ndiagram. Since the radiation from any location is beamed, the beam probably varies in time, so that (a) the\ninferred luminosity may be an overestimate of the true luminosity, and (b) the observed duration of a flare\nmay be an underestimate of its true duration.\nFinally, we comment briefly on a possible process for creating the sudden resistivity. The current\nrequires that electrons and ions (or positrons) flow in opposite directions around the toroid. Suppose that,\nfor some reason, the density locally becomes low enough that the relative flow velocities lead to a two-stream\ninstability. This will give rise to local energy dissipation, hence to heating of that region of the plasma. But\nheating will lead to expansion, which will further reduce the density. In order to maintain the current, the\nvelocity differential must increase, which will enhance the two-stream instability. Hence this combination of\nmicroscopic and macroscopic processes may lead to a sudden very strong two-stream instability that would\nmake the region locally \"electrically turbulent\" and resistive.\nWhy curvature radiation rather than conventional synchrotron radiation? The DC electric field drives\nelectrons parallel to the magnetic field, so there is initially no transverse momentum to lead to synchrotron\nradiation. Furthermore, the gyro-radius of the electrons is much smaller than the radius of the toroid, so\nelectrons will continue to follow field lines. For instance, for the parameters considered above, T = 104.6 s ,\nR = 1014.3 cm , B = 10 G, k = 0.1 we find that Ue,rr = 1014.8 eV. The gyro radius would be given by\nrg = 10\u22122.5 Ee B \u22121 ,\n\n(18)\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n\nwhere Ee is in eV and B is in Gauss, if the electron velocity were transverse to the magnetic field. Hence\nwe obtain the estimate rg = 1011.3 cm. Since this is much smaller than R, we may infer that electrons will\nbe moving essentially along the magnetic field lines. Hence radiation will be curvature radiation rather than\nconventional synchrotron radiation.\nIn Table 1 we show the model parameters for a set of 9 parameter sets, where we choose k = 0.1 in\nall models, magnetic field strengths of B = 10\u22121 G (model A,D,G), B = 1 G (model B,E,H), B = 10 G\n(model C,F,I), and the length and radius of curvature L = 1014 (model A,B,C), L = 1015 (model D,E,F),\nand L = 1016 (model G,H,I). For this parameter space we find energy release times or flare durations in the\nrange T = 103.5 s (\u2248 1 hour) to T = 105.5 s (\u2248 3.6 days), electron energies limited by radiation reaction of\nUe,rr \u2248 1014 \u2212 1016 erg (0.1-10 PeV), and corresponding photon energies U\u03a6,rr \u2248 107 \u2212 109 eV. Thus we can\nsatisfy the observed measurements within a wide range of the parameter space.\n\n3.\n\nMagnetic field in Crab Flares\n\nWe depict the radial dependence of the magnetic field strength B(r) as a function of distance r from\nthe center of the pulsar in Fig. 1. The Crab pulsar has a spin period of P = 30 ms, which yields a light\ncyclinder radius of rLC = P c/2\u03c0 = 108.2 cm. The surface magnetic field strength is B0 = 1012.6 G, and the\nradius of the pulsar is 12.5 km or r0 = 106.1 cm. The magnetic field inside the light cylinder is a dipole field\nand falls off with an r\u22123 dependence, which yields a field strength of\nBLC = B(r = rLC ) = B0\n\n\u0012\n\nrLC\nr0\n\n\u0013\u22123\n\n= B0\n\n\u0012\n\n108.2\n106.1\n\n\u0013\u22123\n\n= 106.3 G ,\n\n(19)\n\nat the distance rLC of the light cyclinder. Beyond the light cylinder, the field wraps up like an onion skin\n(in the \"striped wind\" region), falling off inversely with distance. Hence at distance r, it has a value of\nB(r) = BLC\n\n\u0012\n\nr\nrLC\n\n\u0013\u22121\n\n= 1014.5 r\u22121 .\n\n(20)\n\nThe magnetic field strength in the nebula is estimated to be 200 mG, i.e., BN = B(r = rN ) = 10\u22123.7 G.\nThe pulsar field will have dropped to this value at a distance of rN = 1018.2 cm, which is one third of the\nobserved radius (1018.7 cm) of the nebula. Hence it seems reasonable to adopt the above relationship between\nB and r (Fig. 1). The zone of particle acceleration by untwisting magnetic fields lies, according to our model\nestimates (Table 1), at a distance of r \u2248 1013 \u2212 1015 cm from the center of the pulsar (shown with a hatched\n5\nregion in Fig. 1), so it is located far away from the pulsar and the light cyclinder (R >\n\u223c 10 rLC ), but close to\n\u22124\n<\nthe pulsar when compared to the Crab nebula diameter (R \u223c 10 rN ), such as seen in a Hubble or Chandra\nimage.\n\n4.\n\nPredicted Scaling Law\n\nBased on our model we can predict a scaling law between the observables of the photon energy U\u03a6 , total\nluminosity L, and flare duration T . The radiation reaction-limited photon energy U\u03a6,rr varies according to\nEq. (14) with the radial distance R and the magnetic field B as,\nU\u03a6,rr \u221d R1/2 B 3/4 .\n\n(21)\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n\nCombining the relationships of Eq. (16) and (17) we find that the total luminosity varies with the observables\nR and B as,\nL \u221d R2 B 2 .\n(22)\nThe duration of a flare (or unwinding episode of the twisted magnetic field) varies linearly with R (Eq. 5),\nT \u221dR.\n\n(23)\n\nFrom these three relationships (Eqs. 21-23) we can eliminate R and B and arrive at the following scaling\nlaw for the observables U\u03a6 , L, and T ,\nU\u03a6 \u221d L3/8 T \u22121/4 .\n(24)\nThus, if the total luminosity L and the time scale T of a flare are observed, the photon energy U\u03a6 can be\npredicted, or vice versa. Such a scaling law could be tested in the future either for a statistical sample of\nflares from the same pulsar, or among different pulsars.\n\n5.\n\nDiscussion and Conclusions\n\nPrevious models of particle acceleration in pulsar and supernova remnant environments include: (i)\nmagnetohydrodynamical (MHD) models (Rees and Gunn 1974), Kennel and Coroniti 1984), (ii) diffusive\nshock acceleration (Drury 1983, Blandford and Eichler 1987), (iii) shock-drift acceleration (Kirk et al. 2000,\nReville and Kirk 2010), (iv) magnetohydrodynamical instabilities (Komissarov and Lyubarsky 2004, Del\nZanna et al. 2004, Camus et al. 2009, Komissarov and Lyutikov 2011), (v) acceleration due to absorption of\nion cyclotron waves (Arons 2008), (vi) runaway acceleration (de Jager et al. 1996), (vii) magnetic reconnection\nin an AC striped wind, and (viii) a linear electric accelerator operating in the electric fields of reconnection\nsites (Uzdensky et al. 2011). Difficulties with the diffusive shock acceleration model arise because the\nsynchrotron cooling length is comparable with the Larmor radius (since the gyroperiod is a lower limit\nfor the acceleration time scale), for the strong electric fields that are required to compensate the radiation\nreaction (Abdo et al. 2011, Striani et al. 2011).\nHere we propose an alternative mechanism of DC electric field acceleration parallel the the magnetic field\nof untwisting flux tubes. The particle dynamics in the acceleration region (at a distance of R \u2248 1013 \u2212 1015\ncm (Table 1 and Fig. 1) is completely dominated by the magnetic field, since the plasma-\u03b2 parameter is much\nless than unity (i.e., \u03b2 = nkB T /(B 2 /8\u03c0) \u2248 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22128 for n = 1 cm\u22123 , T \u2248 107 K, and B \u2248 1 G). A twisted\ntoroidal magnetic field can naturally be generated for a number of reasons: for instance, by reconnection in\nthe magnetic \"onion skin\" of the \"striped-wind\" region.\nThe spin-down of a fast-rotating neutron star provides free energy for a toroidal field. Occasional\nsporadic glitches in the rotational frequency (with typical amplitudes of \u2206\u03a9/\u03a9 \u2248 10\u22129 \u2212 10\u22126 ), thought to\noccur due to neutron starquakes in the stressed crust of the neutron star, introduce sudden changes in the\nco-rotating magnetic field, which may cause sudden topological changes. A sudden change in the current\nalong the toroidal magnetic field that accelerates both electrons and positrons (in opposite directions) may\nlead to a particle velocity distribution with the right (positive) sign of the curvature of the distribution\nfunction to trigger a two-stream instability. The mechanism of a two-stream instability to generate toroidal\nmagnetic fields in the magnetosphere of the Crab pulsar has been studied in Nanobashvili (2011). The\ntwo-stream instability may also be due to the resistivity-driven development of microscopic or macroscopic\nturbulence outlined in Section 2.\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n\nIn fact, giant pulses from the Crab pulsar up to 200 times the average pulse size with a powerlaw\ndistribution have been observed in gamma rays and radio wavelengths during previous flaring episodes\n(Argyle and Gower 1972; Lundgren et al. 1995), indicating sporadic giant energy releases in a system governed\nby self-organized criticality (Young and Kenny 1996; Warzawski and Melatos 2008). Similar powerlaw\ndistributions have been found for magnetospheric substorms, solar flares, stellar flares, soft gamma-ray\nrepeaters, black hole objects, blazars, and cosmic rays (Aschwanden 2011), which all are believed to be\ncaused in one way or the other by nonlinear energy dissipation events by magnetic reconnection in twisted,\nstressed, and nonpotential magnetic fields.\nA statistical model for the \u03b3-ray variability of the Crab nebula has been simulated for electrons that\nhave maximum energies proportional to the size of knots (Yuan et al. 2011), which can also be applied to\nthe size of untwisting magnetic field regions in our model, yielding a similar accelerated electron spectrum.\nFuture observations of flaring episodes from the Crab nebula should yield statistics of the flare time durations\nT , of the spatial size S of flaring knots, the total energy release W , and the luminosity L = W/T . Modeling\nof the twisted magnetic field B(r) together with the free energy and current density contained in the (nonpotential) azimuthal component B\u03c6 , could then provide testable scaling laws between the energies released\nin flare events and the observed physical parameters. Furthermore, our predicted scaling law between the\nmaximum photon energy U\u03a6 , luminosity L, and flare duration T (Eq. 24) may prove to be appropriate for\nmultiple flares from pulsars.\n\nREFERENCES\nAbdo,A. et al. 2011, Science 331, Issue 6018, 739.\nArgyle, E. and Gower, J.F.R. 1972, ApJ 175, L89.\nArons, J. 2008, in Neutron Stars and Pulsars, 40 Years After the Discovery, ed.
