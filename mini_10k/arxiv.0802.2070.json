Introduction\nThe pioneer works by Morgan (1958) and S\u00e9rsic & Pastoriza\n(1967) have shown that many spiral galaxies host circumnuclear star formation regions (CNSFRs) and several works have\nstudied these regions. In one of the most recent works, Knapen\n(2005) uses H\u03b1 images of a sample of spiral galaxies to study\nCNSFRs, as well as nuclear star formation regions. They found\nthat CNSFRs are present in about 20% of spiral galaxies and almost always occur within a barred host. In this paper we adopt\nthe definition of Knapen (2005) to distinguish CNSFRs from\nnuclear star formation regions: CNSFRs are the ones observed\nwithin circular areas with diameters of a few kpc around the\ngalactic nucleus, while nuclear star formation regions are observed in more internal areas a few hundred parsec across. In\nparticular, the formation of CNSFRs in barred galaxies seems\nto be due to the radial inflow of gas along bars to the galactic center (Roberts et al. 1979; Friedli & Benz 1995; Sakamoto\net al. 1999; Sheth et al. 2005; Jogge et al 2005). This gas is\naccumulated in a ring structure between two inner Lindblad\nresonances (Knapen et al. 1995).\nGas inflow is also necessary to feed the nuclear massive\nblack hole in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and surrounding nuclear star formation regions, probably yielding the socalled AGN-starburst connection (Norman & Scoville 1988;\nSend offprint requests to: Oli L. Dors Jr.,\ne-mail: oli.dors@ufrgs.br\n\nTerlevich et al. 1990; Heckman et al. 1997; Gonz\u00e1lez Delgado\net al. 1998; Ferrarese & Merritt 2000; Cid Fernandes et al.\n2001; Storchi-Bergmann 2001; Heckman 2004). Recent observational studies have shown evidence of gas inflow: StorchiBergmann et al. (2007) and Fathi et al. (2006) report the discovery of gas streaming motions along spiral arms towards\nthe LINER nuclei of the galaxies NGC 6951 and NGC 1097,\nwhile Fathi et al. (2007) found gas inflow to the nuclear star\nformation region of the galaxy M 83. Moreover, several works\nhave found star formation around active nuclei (e.g. Riffel et al.\n2007; Kauffmann et al. 2003)\nIn CNSFRs, the line ratio [O iii]\u03bb5007/H\u03b2 (hereafter\n[O iii]/H\u03b2) is usually weak or not observable and the emission lines have lower equivalent widths than those of disk H ii\nregions (e.g. Diaz et al. 2007; Bresolin et al. 1999; Bresolin\n& Kennicutt 1997; Kennicutt et al. 1989). The low value of\n[O iii]/H\u03b2 has been attributed to over-solar abundances (e.g.\nBoer & Schulz 1993). At their location in the innermost parts\nof galactic disks, these objects are expected to be the most\nmetal-rich star-forming regions. In fact, D\u0131\u0301az et al. (2007) obtained long-slit observations for 12 CNSFRs and, using a semiempirical method to derivate of oxygen abundances, found that\nsome of them have 12+log(O/H)=8.85, a value consistent with\nthe maximum oxygen abundance value derived for central parts\nof spiral galaxies (Pilyugin et al. 2007).\nRegarding the equivalent width of emission lines,\nKennicutt et al. (1989) found that the equivalent widths of H\u03b1\n\n\f2\n\nO. L. Dors Jr., T. Storchi-Bergmann, Rogemar A. Riffel, A. A Schimdt: Circumnuclear star formation regions\n\nFig. 1. Sample spectra: star-forming regions F in NGC 6951\n(top) and J in NGC 1097 (bottom).\nEW(H\u03b1) in CNSFRs are about 7 times lower than the ones\nin disk H ii regions. They proposed several scenarios to explain this behavior, such as (i) deficiency of high-mass stars\nin the initial mass function (IMF), (ii) a long timescale for\nstar formation, and (iii) high dust abundance. However, neither of these mechanisms turned out to be the dominant effect.\nUnfortunately, spectroscopic data and abundance estimates are\nonly available for a small number of CNSFRs.\nWith the goal of increasing the number of CNSFRs with\ndetermined gas abundances and star formation rates, we have\ncombined two-dimensional integral field unit (IFU) data of\nCNSFRs located in the galaxies NGC 1097 and NGC 6951 with\na grid of photoionization models to derive their nebular gas\nproperties. Using high-quality two-dimensional data, we could\nalso investigate the cause of lower equivalent widths of emission lines observed in CNSFRs with respect to those of inner\ndisk HII regions. In Section 2 we give details about the observational data we used, in Section 3 we present a description of\nthe methodology used to derive the physical parameters, while\nin Section 4 we present our results. The discussion of the outcome and our final conclusions are given in Sections 5 and 6,\nrespectively.\n\n2. Observational data\nThe observational spectroscopic data on NGC 1097 and\nNGC 6951 were drawn from the works of Fathi et al. (2006)\nand Storchi-Bergmann et al. (2007). Basically these data were\nobtained with IFUs of the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrographs\n(GMOS-IFU) on the Gemini South (for NGC 1097) and North\n(for NGC 6951) telescopes using the R400-G5325 grating and\nr-G0326 filter, covering the spectral range 5600-7000 \u00c5 with\na resolution of R \u2248 2300. Three IFU fields were observed in\neach galaxy, covering an angular field of 15\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 7\u2032\u2032 . The reduction procedure resulted in 50 \u00d7 70 spectra for each IFU field,\neach corresponding to an angular coverage of 0.1\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 0.1\u2032\u2032 . We\nadopted distances for NGC 6951 and NGC 1097 of 24 Mpc and\n17 Mpc (Tully 1988), respectively, such that 1\u2032\u2032 corresponds to\n\n96 pc for the former and 68 pc for the latter galaxy. The reader\nis referred to the papers above for a full description of the data.\nFigure 1 shows spectra of CNSFRs identified by the letters F and J in Figs. 2 and 3 located in the circumnuclear rings\nof NGC 6951 and NGC 1097, respectively. Using the observed\nspectra we built maps for flux distributions in the H\u03b1 emission line and for the line ratios [N ii]\u03bb6583/H\u03b1, ([S ii]\u03bb6717 +\n\u03bb6731)/H\u03b1, as well as for the EW(H\u03b1). These maps are shown\nin Figs. 2 and 3. Throughout the paper we identify the line ratios above as [N ii]/H\u03b1 and [S ii]/H\u03b1. For NGC 6951 the observed field completely covers the circumnuclear ring. The data\nof the ring were separated from those of the inner region by fitting two ellipses to the H\u03b1 image of NGC 6951: one to the inner\nborder of the ring and the other to the outer border (see StorchiBergmann et al. 2007). In the NGC 6951 H\u03b1 map, we clearly\nsee several regions of star formation. We have identified nine of\nthem as indicated in Fig. 2. Since for NGC 1097 the observation field covered only part of the ring, we could only identify\ntwo regions in this galaxy (see Fig. 3).\nFor these measurements, we assumed that each star formation region has a circular symmetry, whose center corresponds\nto the peak in the H\u03b1 intensity and the radius defined as the one\nwhere the flux reaches 50 % of the peak value. Nevertheless, we\ncan see from Fig. 2 that the CNSFRs have irregular morphologies and the assumption above can result in some uncertainties\nin the H\u03b1 flux and in line ratio measurements. To estimate how\nmuch flux we may be missing, for NGC 6951, we compared\nthe sum of the H\u03b1 flux of all regions (obtained from photometry within circular apertures) with the flux integrated over the\nwhole ring. We found that the diffuse gas contribution (from\nregions not covered by the circles) is about 12 %. A similar result was found for individual H ii regions by Oey & Kennicutt\n(1997). In relation to line ratios, we measured the median values considering different values for the radius of each region\nand differences no greater than 10% were found. We thus estimate that uncertainties in both fluxes and line ratios due to\nuncertainties in the geometry of the CNSFRs are about 10%.\nIn Table 1 we show the adopted area of each region, the luminosity of H\u03b1, and the median values of EW(H\u03b1), [N ii]/H\u03b1, and\n[S ii]/H\u03b1.\n\n3. Photoionization models\nTo derive the metallicity, ionization parameter, and the age\nof the CNSFRs, we employed the photoionization code\nCloudy/95.03 (Ferland 2002) to build a grid of models covering a large space of nebular parameters. The models were\nbuilt as in Dors & Copetti (2006), with metallicities Z=1.1, 1.0,\n0.7, 0.6 Z\u2299 , and ionization parameter logarithm (log U) of \u22122.0,\n\u22122.5, and \u22123.0 dex. In each model a stellar cluster was assumed\nas the ionizing source with the stellar energy distributions obtained from the synthesis code S T ARBURS T 99 (Leitherer et\nal. 1999). We built models with stellar clusters formed by instantaneous and continuous bursts with stellar upper mass limits of Mup = 20, 30 and 100 M\u2299 , Z= 1.0 and 0.4 Z\u2299 , and ages\nranging from 0.01 to 10 Myr with a step of 0.5 Myr. Clusters\nolder than about 10 Myr and formed instantaneously have no\nmore O stars (Leitherer & Heckman 1995), so were not consid-\n\n\fO. L. Dors Jr., T. Storchi-Bergmann, Rogemar A. Riffel, A.

The circles and the letters identify each region as defined in Section 2.\nered in our models. The metallicity of the nebula was matched\nto the closest available metallicity of the stellar cluster. The solar composition refers to Asplund et al. (2005) and corresponds\nto log(O/H) = \u22123.30.\n\n4. Results\nSince the observational data for NGC 6951 and NGC 1097 covers a restricted wavelength range, few emission line ratios can\nbe used in our analysis. Storchi-Bergmann et al. (1994) and\nRaimann et al. (2000) showed that [N ii]/H\u03b1 can be used to obtain the oxygen abundance of star-forming galaxies. However,\nthis line ratio also dependents on the ionization parameter U\n(Kewley & Dopita 2002), thus the combination with other line\nratios is desirable in order to decrease the uncertainties in the\nO/H estimates. Thus we used our photoionization model grid\nto build an [N ii]/H\u03b1 vs. [S ii]/ H\u03b1 diagram to derive Z and U\nof the CNSFRs located in NGC 6951 and NGC 1097. Recently,\nViironen et al. (2007) have shown that diagnostic diagrams using [N ii]/H\u03b1 and [S ii]/ H\u03b1 are a powerful tool for estimating\nZ and U of star-forming regions. Moreover, these line ratios\nare not dependent on the Mup and age assumed in the models\n(see Fig. 5). We point out that a cautionary note has been put\nforth by Mazzuca et al. (2006) regarding the use of diagnostic\ndiagrams including the line ratio [N ii]/H\u03b1: they can yield degenerate values for the metallicity, as star-forming regions with\nlow Z and U have [N ii]/H\u03b1 values similar to regions with high\nZ and U. However, CNSFRs are known to have high abundances (near solar) (see Sect. 5.1), ruling out the possibility\nof low abundances. This is confirmed by the work of StorchiBergmann et al. (1996), which shows an increasing gas abundance towards the nucleus, including a few regions in circumnuclear rings.\nThe results of our models compared to observational data\nfor NGC 6951 and NGC 1097 are shown in Fig. 4, in which\nwe considered an instantaneous burst with age of 2.5 Myr and\nMup = 100 M\u2299 . We can see that the observational data are\n\nwell represented by models having metallicities Z \u2248 Z\u2299 and\nlog U \u2248 \u22122.3, with uncertainties of about 0.03 and 0.1 dex, due\nto the uncertainties in the line ratios discussed above. In Table 1\nwe show the Z and log U values for each region, obtained by\nlinear interpolation from the model grid. In this table we also\npresent the values of electron density Ne computed from the\nobserved line ratio [S ii]\u03bb6717/\u03bb6731 and adopting T e = 104\nK (Osterbrock 1989). The Ne values cover the range 50-600\ncm\u22123 , which is typical of H ii regions (Copetti et al. 2000).\nTo obtain the ages of the CNSFRs, we used the observed\nvalues of equivalent widths and [O iii]/H\u03b2, which decrease almost monotonically as a function of time (Magris et al. 2003,\nCopetti et al. 1986). In Fig. 5 we plot the values predicted by the\nmodels for EW(Br\u03b3), EW(H\u03b2), EW(H\u03b1), as well as [N ii]/H\u03b1,\n[S ii]/H\u03b1 and [O iii]/H\u03b2 versus age. We considered instantaneous and continuous star formation bursts with Mup = 20, 30\nand 100 M\u2299 , log U = \u22122.5 and Z = Z\u2299 . The values of the line\nratios [N ii]/H\u03b1 and [S ii]/H\u03b1 were found to be approximately\nconstant for the range of ages considered. However, [O iii]/H\u03b2\nshows a chaotic behavior between 2 and 6 Myr, mainly for\nMup =100 M\u2299 and instantaneous burst. This happens due to the\nincrease in the number of ionizing photons by the presence of\nWolf Rayet stars in this phase (Leitherer & Heckman 1995).\nThis behavior was also noted by Dopita et al. (2006). As no\nfeature of Wolf Rayet stars was observed in our data and because [O iii]/H\u03b2 is very dependent on many nebular parameters, it will not be considered as an age tracer in this paper. The\nuse of the equivalent width of emission lines seems to be more\nreliable for deriving ages of star-forming regions, since they\nbasically depend on Mup and on the slope of the IMF (Copetti\net al. 1986).\nUsing the EW(H\u03b1) values shown in Table 1, the CNSFR\nages predicted by instantaneous and continuous models are\naround 7 Myr and over 10 Myr, respectively, independent of\nthe Mup assumed. Table 1 also presents the values for the star\nformation rate (SFR) computed using the luminosity of the re-\n\n\f4\n\nO. L. Dors Jr., T. Storchi-Bergmann, Rogemar A. Riffel, A.

(2006) present an emission-line diagnostic analysis of the nuclear starburst ring of NGC 7742 and\nfind roughly solar abundances.\nRecently, Sarzi et al. (2007) presented a study of CNSFRs\nlocated in eight galaxies which include the regions B, E and F\nof our sample. They also used empirical methods to derive the\nmetallicities of these regions and find abundances similar to\nthe ones derived in this paper. D\u0131\u0301az et al. (2007) use a semiempirical abundance calibration to find that the CNSFRs in\nNGC 2903, NGC 3351, and NGC 3504 have metallicities comparable to the ones derived in this paper. Until now, only a\ncase of very low abundance on the order of 0.2-0.4 Z\u2299 in the\nCNSFRs located in NGC 3310 was reported by Pastoriza et al.\n(1993). This low abundance can be understood as due to the\nfact that this galaxy has an interaction history (Elmegreen et al.\n2002), through which neutral gas may have been accreted to\nthe ring.\nDue to the fact that CNSFRs have very low excitation, with\n[O iii]/H\u03b2 < 1 (e.g. H\u00e4gale et al. 2007, P\u00e9rez et al. 2000)\nand to their central location in the galactic disk, it is expected\nthat these objects have somewhat higher abundance than is derived for inner disk H ii regions. To check this, we have plotted the [N ii]/H\u03b1 in Fig. 6 (lower panel) against oxygen abundance for some disk H ii regions located in 13 spiral galaxies. This sample includes the most metal-rich nebulae in which\ntemperature sensitive emission lines have been detected. The\ndata were taken from Bresolin (2007), Bresolin et al. (2005,\n2004), Kennicutt et al. (2003), Castellanos et al. (2002), and\nSkillman et al. (1996). With the exception of the oxygen abundances from Skillman et al. (1996), which were recalculated\nby us using the P-method (Pilyugin 2001), all O/H values were\nobtained using direct derivation of the electron temperature.\nAlso included in Fig. 6 are the data of our sample. We can\nsee that the CNSFRs show the highest oxygen abundances, together with some disk nebulae, a result also obtained by D\u0131\u0301az\net al. (2007). Since abundance determinations via photoionization models are overestimated by a factor of 0.1-0.4 dex when\n\ncompared to direct determinations (Dors & Copetti 2005), our\nabundance estimates should be interpreted as upper limits. If\nCNSFRs are included in the computation of abundance gradients in spirals, we would expect therefore a plateau at very\nsmall galactocentric distances.\n\n5.2. Star formation history\nThe H\u03b1 luminosity values found for the CNSFRs in this paper\nare in the range 2 \u00d7 1038 \u2212 1.2 \u00d7 1040 erg s\u22121 , compatible with\nvalues of regions in circumnuclear rings of other spiral galaxies\n(e.g. D\u0131\u0301az et al. 2007). These luminosity values yield star formation rates of 0.002-0.1 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , characterizing a moderate\nstar-forming regime. Averaging the SFR values in Table 1, we\nfind 0.04 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , a similar value to the one found by Ho et\nal. (1997) for a sample of nuclear star-forming regions and by\nShi et al. (2006), who studied a sample of 385 circumnuclear\nstar-forming regions in galaxies with different Hubble types.\nWe cannot conclude from our data alone whether the star\nformation has been continuous or instantaneous in the rings,\nalthough the former scenario has not been favored by previous\nstudies. For example, Sarzi et al. (2007) use absorption-line index diagrams to show that the hypothesis of a constant star formation in their sample can be ruled out. Allard et al. (2006) find\nthat the star formation in the ring of M 100 have occurred in a\nseries of short bursts for the past 500 Myr or so. These results\ncan be understood within the following scenario. Once massive stars are formed, they cause turbulence and heating in the\nmolecular cloud, inhibiting further star formation (Hartmann et\nal. 2001, Blitz & Shu 1980). Since no systematic age sequence\nis observed along the NGC 6951 ring, the star formation mode\nseems to be as predicted by the popcorn model (B\u00f6ker et al.\n2008), in which the entire ring begins to form stars at about the\nsame time or at random times. A similar result was also derived\nby Mazzuca et al. (2008), who used photometric H\u03b1 imaging\nof 22 nuclear rings to find that only a very small fraction of\nthem show age sequences along the ring.\n\n5.3. Age estimates\nOur modeling gives ages of about 7.0 Myr for an instantaneous burst and more than 10 Myr for a continuous burst, with\n\n\f6\n\nO. L. Dors Jr., T. Storchi-Bergmann, Rogemar A. Riffel, A. A Schimdt: Circumnuclear star formation regions\n\nthe CNSFRs in NGC 1097 slightly older than in NGC 6951.\nTo compare our age estimates with those of other CNSFRs,\nwe collected equivalent widths of more CNSFRs from the\nliterature and estimated their ages using Fig. 5. The data\nwere extracted from D\u0131\u0301az et al. (2007) for NGC 2903 and\nNGC 3505, H\u00e4gele et al. (2007) for NGC 3351, Allard et\nal. (2006) for M 100, Reunanen et al. (2000) for NGC 7771,\nand Wakamatsu & Nishida (1980) for NGC 4314, which give\nEW(H\u03b2), EW(H\u03b1), and EW(Br\u03b3) in the range 1-17, 10-40, and\n5-60 \u00c5, respectively. The predicted ages for these EW values\nare of 5-8 Myr and more than 10 Myr for instantaneous and\ncontinuous bursts, respectively, thus similar to the ones we derived for the CNSFRs in the present paper. Somewhat higher\nEW values have been obtained by Mazzuca et al. (2008) for\nHII regions in nuclear rings of more than 20 galaxies. On the\nother hand, studies also utilizing photoionization models give\nages of 1.5-3 Myr for H ii regions located in galactic disks and\nfor H II galaxies (Dors & Copetti 2006; Stasinska & Izotov\n2003; Bresolin et al. 1999; Copetti et al. 1985). We have also\ncompared the ages of our sample with those of disk nebulae\nof similar metallicity. In Fig. 6 we show log(EW(H\u03b2)) and\n12+log(O/H) plotted against log([N ii]/H\u03b1) for these disk H ii\nregions, together with our data for the CNSFRs. We converted\nthe EW(H\u03b1) values shown in Table 1 in EW(H\u03b2) using the relation EW(H\u03b2)\u2248 0.15 EW(H\u03b1) obtained from our models. We\ncan see that the EW(H\u03b2) of the CNSFRs are lower by a factor\nof about 30 than those of their counterpart disk H ii regions.\nAssuming a EW(H\u03b2)= 100 \u00c5 for the innermost disk regions\nand using Fig. 5, we find that these regions are about 3 Myr\nyounger than the CNSFRs.\n\n5.4. The low EW values\nThe age differences found above may not be real, since the very\nlow equivalent widths in CNSFRs stem from other effects than\nthe age. Kennicutt et al. (1989) pointed out possible mechanisms such as (i) deficiency of high-mass stars in the initial\nmass function, (ii) very high dust abundance, (iii) contamination of the continuum by contribution from the bulge or other\nunderlying stellar populations, and (iv) continuous star formation. These hypotheses are discussed below.\nRegarding the hypothesis of the deficiency of high-mass\nstars, since Mup of an ionizing cluster is dependent on the\nmetallicity (Larson & Starrfield 1971; Kahn 1974; Shields &\nTinsley 1976; Stasi\u0144ska 1980; Vilchez & Pagel 1988; Campbell\n1988; Bresolin et al. 1999; Dors & Copetti 2003, 2005, 2006),\nCNSFRs and innermost disk nebulae should have about same\nMup . It is unlikely that the discrepancy in EWs is only due to\nvariation in Mup . Even assuming that the ionizing cluster of\ndisk nebulae have Mup = 100 M\u2299 and the ones of CNSFRs\nhave Mup = 20 M\u2299 , the age difference remains. Also a variation in the IMF can be discarded, since stellar clusters appear to\nform with a universal IMF slope (Kroupa 2007, 2002, Chabrier\n2003).\nThe hypothesis of very high dust abundance in CNSFRs is\nnot favored because they have similar Balmer decrements to\nthose observed for disk H ii regions, suggesting that this is not\n\nthe main source of the low EWs in CNSFRs (Kennicutt et al.\n1989).\nConcerning the contamination of the continuum, several\nworks have found the presence of underlying stellar populations from previous generations of stars in CNSFRs, which can\ndecrease the equivalent widths and yield no real age estimates\nfrom Fig. 5. For example, Buta et al. (2000) found a spread in\nages of about 5 to 200 Myr for clusters in the circumnuclear\nring of NGC 1326, with the largest number of clusters younger\nthan 20 Myr. In the case of NGC 6951 and with measurements\nof the equivalent width of calcium triplet at \u22488500 \u00c5, P\u00e9rez\net al. (2000) found evidence of a population of red supergiant\nstars with ages of 10 to 20 Myr in the ring.\nAn underlying stellar population can contribute in two ways\nto the low EWs by causing a Balmer absorption and yielding\nan extra contribution to the continuum. To estimate the effect\nof an underlying Balmer absortion, we constructed models of\nstellar populations (using the Padova 1994 tracks) with ages in\nthe range 10-1000 Myr. We normalized the continuum of each\nmodel to the observed one and subtracted them from the observed spectra of the CNSFRs of NGC 6951. For all cases, the\nincrease in the EW values due to subtracting of an underlying\nabsorption was at most 10%, much less than needed to compensate for the low observed EW in CNSFRs.\nDetermining of the continuum contribution from underlying stellar populations is not an easy task, since two types of\nstellar populations can be contributing: the stellar population\nfrom the bulge and stars formed in previous episodes of star\nformation in the ring. To evaluate the contribution of the underlying bulge, we performed aperture photometry on the continuum images (not shown) measuring both the CNSFR continuum and that of the bulge in the surrounding regions. We\nconcluded that the bulge contributes with \u2248 75 % of the total\nflux in the case of NGC 6951 and with 50 % in NGC 1097. The\ncorresponding corrections are an increase by a factor of 2 and 4\nin EW(H\u03b1) for NGC 1097 and NGC 6951, respectively. These\nfactors increase the EW(H\u03b1) in NGC 6951 from average values\nof \u224830 \u00c5 to \u2248120 \u00c5 and from \u224810 \u00c5 to \u224820 \u00c5 in NGC 1097.\nThe corresponding changes in age are from \u22487 Myr to \u22486 Myr\nin NGC 6951 and no change for NGC 1097 (\u22487 Myr). Thus the\ncontribution from the bulge to the continuum also does not explain the low EW's in CNSFRs. Stauffer (1981) also studied\nthe bulge contamination using aperture photometry of galaxy\nnuclei to measure the background contribution to the continuum flux, and Kennicutt et al. (1989) used those results to find\na correction factor similar to the one found by us.\nSeveral generations of stars may coexist in CNSFRs because the tidal effects are not strong enough to disrupt the cluster at the radius of the ring, allowing several generations of stars\nto coexist (Buta et al. 2000). Thus the continuum may have a\ncontribution from previous bursts of star formation in the rings.\nTo investigate the effect of this continuum, we built photoionization models to represent a scenario where three bursts of star\nformation have occurred, with ages of 0.01, 10, and 20 Myr for\ntwo values of Mup : 100 and 30 M\u2299 . This is illustrated in Fig. 7,\nwhich shows the evolution of EW(H\u03b2) as a function of time.\nIt can be seen that the EW values decrease considerably when\ncompared with those of a single burst (Fig. 5). If we consider a\n\n\fO. L. Dors Jr., T. Storchi-Bergmann, Rogemar A. Riffel, A. A Schimdt: Circumnuclear star formation regions\n\nFig. 6.

The squares represent data\ncollected from the literature, while the circles represent the data\nof the CNSFRs analyzed in this paper.\ntypical EW(H\u03b2) for CNSFRs of 10 \u00c5 (not corrected for the underlying bulge contribution) and compute the age from Fig. 7,\nwe find ages of 6-7 Myr, similar to the values derived above.\nWe conclude that none of the mechanisms discussed above\nalone yield the low EW values (and resulting larger age)\nobserved in CNSFRs when compared to disk H ii regions.\nHowever, it could be that a combination of more than one\nmechanism can explain the lower EWs in CNSFRs. For example, we can consider the effects of both the dilution by the bulge\nand by previous bursts of star formation. A typical EW(H\u03b2)=\n10 \u00c5 in NGC 6951 will increase to 40 \u00c5 if we correct for contamination by the bulge. Then, we can consider the effect of\nprevious generation of stars in the ring using Fig. 7 instead of\nFig. 5 to obtain the age. We obtain an age of 3-4 Myr, a value in\nconsonance with ages of the innermost disk regions. In this way\nwe eliminate the apparent difference in age between CNSFRs\nand inner-disk H ii regions.\n\n6. Conclusions\nWe have used optical IFU spectroscopic data of CNSFRs in\nNGC 6951 and NGC 1097, which compared to a grid of photoionization models, in order to obtain physical parameters of\nthese regions. We find that the star formation rates are in the\nrange 0.002-0.14 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , thus covering a range from very low\nto moderate star-forming regime. We also find that the CNSFRs\nhave oxygen abundances of 12+log(O/H)\u22488.8, similar to those\nof the most metal-rich nebulae located in inner parts the disks\nof spiral galaxies.\nWe investigated the cause of the very low equivalent width\nof emission lines found in CNSFRs, which suggests an older\nage for these objects than for disk H ii regions. Among the several scenarios invoked to explain this fact, we have concluded\nthat the contamination of the continua of CNSFRs by underlying contributions from both old bulge stars and stars formed\n\n7\n\nFig. 7.
