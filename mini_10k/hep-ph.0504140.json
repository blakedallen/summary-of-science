Conventional Sudakov\u2013resummed perturbation theory describing the decay of an onshell heavy quark yields a divergent expansion. Detailed understanding of this divergence\nin terms of infrared renormalons has paved the way for making quantitative predictions. In\nparticular, the leading renormalon ambiguity cancels out between the Sudakov factor and\nthe quark pole mass. This cancellation requires renormalon resummation but involves no\nnon-perturbative information. Additional effects due to the Fermi motion of the quark in\nthe meson can be systematically taken into account through power corrections, which are only\nimportant near the physical endpoint. This way the moments of the B\u0304 \u2212\u2192 Xs \u03b3 spectrum with\nexperimentally\u2013accessible cuts - which had been so far just parametrized - were recently\ncomputed by perturbative means. At Moriond these predictions were confronted with new\ndata from BaBar.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nExperimental measurements of inclusive decays, such as B\u0304 \u2212\u2192 Xs \u03b3 and B\u0304 \u2212\u2192 Xu l\u03bd\u0304, cannot\nbe performed over the whole phase space. Therefore, in order to make precision tests of the\nStandard Model, we must have a quantitative understanding of the spectra.\nMost of the rate of these decays is associated with jet\u2013like kinematics, where the invariant\nmass of the hadronic system is small. It is well known that this important region is difficult to\n\n\fdescribe theoretically [1\u20133]: the observed spectrum is directly sensitive to soft radiation off the\nheavy quark which is hard to disentangle from the \"primordial\" momentum distribution of the\nheavy quark in the meson. Technically, this sensitivity leads to the breakdown of the perturbative\nexpansion in powers of \u03b1s (mb ) as well as that of the local Operator Product Expansion (OPE)\nin powers of \u039b/mb .\nLet us consider the photon\u2013energy spectrum in B\u0304 \u2212\u2192 Xs \u03b3. The non-perturbative nature of\nthis distribution is obvious from the fact that the physical endpoint is near E\u03b3 = MB /2, where\nMB is the meson mass, while at any order in perturbation theory - where the initial state is\nrepresented by an on-shell heavy quark - the spectrum vanishes for E\u03b3 > mb /2, where mb is the\nquark pole mass. In reality the quark is off shell and its Fermi motion translates into smearing a\nof the spectrum up to E\u03b3 \u2243 MB /2. Given this physical picture the perturbative approach\nappears inappropriate. Consequently, the predominant strategy has been to parametrize the\nspectrum based on available data, rather than to compute it. On the other hand, since total\ninclusive rates, as well as their first few moments, are theoretically described by the OPE [4,5] -\nand in particular, if O(\u039b2 /m2b ) terms are neglected, by perturbation theory - one expects just\nsmall, computable deviations when moderate kinematic cuts are applied [6]. Progressing to more\nstringent cuts, resummed perturbation theory is needed. Eventually it must be complemented by\nnon-perturbative corrections. We will show that the predictive power of resummed perturbation\ntheory is significantly higher than it superficially appears to be.\n2\n\nThe divergent nature of the perturbative expansion of spectral moments\n\nA key ingredient in the perturbative approach to inclusive spectra is the use of moment space.\nConsidering the B\u0304 \u2212\u2192 Xs \u03b3 photon\u2013energy spectrum in terms of x \u2261 2E\u03b3 /mb , the perturbative\ncoefficients have singular structure at the perturbative endpoint, x = 1. Owing to cancellation\nof logarithmic infrared singularities between real\u2013emission and virtual corrections, the moments\nPT\n\n\u0393N \u2261\n\nZ\n\ndE\u03b3\n\n\u0012\n\n2E\u03b3\nmb\n\n\u0013N \u22121\n\nd\u0393PT\n=\ndE\u03b3\n\nZ\n\n1\n\ndx xN \u22121\n\n0\n\nd\u0393PT (x)\ndx\n\n(1)\n\nare infrared\u2013 and collinear\u2013safe. \u0393PT\nN has a well defined perturbative expansion to all orders. This\nexpansion, however, does not converge well. It has: (a) Sudakov logarithms, ln N , that are\nthe finite reminder in the cancellation of logarithmic infrared singularities. These logarithms\nappear at any order in the expansion and dominate the coefficients at large N (b) infrared\nrenormalons that reflect power\u2013like sensitivity to soft momenta and induce factorial growth of\nthe coefficients at large orders that renders the perturbative expansion non-summable.\nTo make quantitative predictions both these sources of large corrections need to be resummed. The resummation of Sudakov logarithms is possible thanks to the factorization property of matrix elements in the soft and the collinear limits. In decay spectra there are two\ndistinct regions of phase space giving rise to infrared logarithms [7]: soft radiation with momenta of order m/N from the nearly on-shell heavy quark and fragmentation of the final\u2013state\njet of mass squared m2 /N . In moment space these contribution factorize:\n2\n\u0393PT\nN = H(mb )J(mb /N ; \u03bc)SPT (mb /N ; \u03bc) \u2261 H(mb ) \u00d7 Sud(N, mb ),\n\n(2)\n\nup to corrections O(1/N ). Here \u03bc is a logarithmic factorization scale. The Sudakov factor,\nwhich sums up the logs to all orders in \u03b1s (mb ), takes the form of an exponential:\n(\n\n\u221e n+1\nX\nX\n\n2\n\u03b1MS\ns (mb )\nSud(N, mb ) = exp \u2212\ncn,k lnk N\n\u03c0\nn=1 k=1\na\n\n!n )\n\n= exp\n\n\uf8f1\n\u221e\n\uf8f2X\n\uf8f3\n\nl=0\n\ngl (\u03bb)\n\n2\n\u03b1MS\ns (mb )\n\u03c0\n\n!l\u22121 \uf8fc\n\uf8fd\n\n,(3)\n\n\uf8fe\n\nThis smearing is related to the structure of the initial state, and it is independent of the appearance of\nresonances in the final state.\n\n\f\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n2\nwhere \u03bb \u2261 \u03b20 \u03b1MS\ns (mb )/\u03c0 ln N . Note that Sud(N, mb ) depends on the quark mass only through\nthe argument of the coupling and that it does not depend on any factorization scale. The first\nthree towers of logarithms in the exponent, i.e. cn,n+1 - leading logs (LL), cn,n - next\u2013to\u2013\nleading logs (NLL) and cn,n\u22121 - next\u2013to\u2013next\u2013to\u2013leading logs (NNLL) are known exactly [8,9].\nThe numerical values of the first few coefficients (for Nf = 4) are given in Table 1. Obviously,\nthere is problem: the coefficients increase so fast with increasing powers of \u03b1s (mb ) (corresponding\nto subleading logarithms) that the sum in the exponent cannot be determined. The result of\nconventional Sudakov resummation with fixed logarithmic accuracy (see Section 2.1 in Ref. [8])\nis shown in Fig. 1.

We observe that:\n(a) the result is similar to the full QCD matrix of Table 1; (b) further subleading logarithms\nhave yet larger coefficients. We therefore deduce that the divergent behavior in Table 1 is related\nwith running\u2013coupling effects. This is a general phenomenon [10\u201314]: the large\u2013order behavior\nof Sudakov exponents is dominated by infrared renormalons.

(5) - when computing it from the short distance mass (e.g. from mMS\nb ).\n(c) Performing an inverse\u2013Mellin integral according to Eq. (4).\n\n\fIn general, the calculation of the Sudakov exponent by DGE differ from conventional Sudakov resummation (truncation of the sum over l in Eq. (3)) in two respects. First, on the\npurely perturbative level, by using Eq. (6) and incorporating the exact analytic results for the\nanomalous dimensions in the large\u2013\u03b20 limit [14],\n5\n\nBS (u) = e 3 u (1 \u2212 u) + O(1/\u03b20 ),\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\nsin \u03c0u\n1\n1 5u\ne3\n+\n+ O(1/\u03b20 ),\nBJ (u) =\n2\n1 \u2212 u 1 \u2212 u/2\n\u03c0u\n\n(7)\n\nthe resummation of running\u2013coupling contributions is performed to all orders (rather than to\na given logarithmic accuracy) making the result renormalization\u2013group invariant [10]. The\npower\u2013like infrared sensitivity, which shows up in Eq. (3) through the divergence of the series,\nexplicitly appears in Eq. (6) as Borel singularities at integer and half integer values of u. This\nbrings us to the second difference, which is an important advantage of DGE, namely having a\ndefinite prescription to make power\u2013like separation between perturbative and non-perturbative\ncontributions. The PV prescription we choose guarantees that the perturbative moments are\nreal valued: Sud(N, mb )|PV = [ Sud(N \u2217 , mb )|PV ]\u2217 . This choice also defines the non-perturbative\npower corrections.\nAnother key property of this calculation is the exact cancellation [14] of the leading, u = 1/2\ninfrared renormalon ambiguity b between the Sudakov factor and the quark pole mass in Eq. (4).\nThis means that the infrared sensitivity, which severely limits the accuracy of the calculation\nin a conventional perturbative approach (Fig. 1), is nothing else but an artifact of perturbation\ntheory - specifically, of using an on-shell heavy quark in the initial state - and it is fully\nremoved if renormalon resummation is applied in both the Sudakov factor and the pole mass.\nTo understand this cancellation consider the process\u2013independent\ndefinition of the quark\nE\nD\n\u0002\n\u0003\n+\ndistribution in the meson as the Fourier transform of B(PB ) \u03a8\u0304(y)\u03b3 \u03a6y (0, y) \u03a8(0) \u03bc B(PB )\nwith respect to y \u2212 where y is a lightlike vector, \u03a6y (0, y) is a Wilson line in this direction,\nand \u03bc is a (dimensional\u2013regularization) ultraviolet renormalization scale. Let us compare this\ndistribution to its perturbative counterpart, D\nnamely the quark distribution in an on-shell\nheavy\nE\n\u0002\n\u0003\n+\nquark defined by the Fourier transform of b(pb ) \u03a8\u0304(y)\u03b3 \u03a6y (0, y) \u03a8(0) \u03bc b(pb ) . While the\nformer is unambiguous, the latter involves an on-shell heavy quark external state, which is\nunphysical. While the moments of the latter distribution are infrared\u2013 and collinear\u2013safe as\nfar as logarithms are concerned, their infrared sensitivity renders them ambiguous at power\n\u2212\naccuracy. The large\u2013N limit corresponds to the replacements iPB+ y \u2212 \u2212\u2192 N and ip+\nb y \u2212\u2192 N\nin the two matrix elements, respectively. One then obtains the following relation between the\ntwo soft functions [14]:\nS(MB /N ; \u03bc) = SPT (mb /N ; \u03bc) e\u2212(N \u22121)\u039b\u0304/MB F((N \u2212 1)\u039b/MB ),\n|\n\n{z\n\nleading renormalon cancels out\n\n(8)\n\n}\n\nwhere power corrections on the soft scale are split into two categories: kinematic ones, which\ninvolve \u039b\u0304 \u2261 MB \u2212mb and therefore strongly depend on the quark\u2013mass definition, and dynamical\nones (F), which describe the\n\u0010 Fermi motion of\n\u0011 the quark in the meson. The OPE shows [1, 2]\n2\nthat the latter begin at O ((N \u2212 1)\u039b/MB ) . As indicated in Eq. (8) the cancellation of the\nleading renormalon ambiguity involves only the kinematic term and therefore it can be realized\nwithout using any non-perturbative input on the quark distribution in the meson. An explicit\ncalculation of the quark distribution in an on-shell heavy quark in the large\u2013\u03b20 limit c shows that\nb\n\nThis cancellation concerns all the moments and it comes on top of the cancellation of the u = 1/2 renormalon\nin the total rate [18].\nc\nSuch calculations were performed in a process\u2013specific context [14] for B\u0304 \u2212\u2192 Xs \u03b3 and B\u0304 \u2212\u2192 Xu l\u03bd\u0304 as well as\nusing the process\u2013independent definition of the quark distribution function [9].\n\n\fFigure 2: The moment\u2013space Sudakov factor Sud(N, mb ) (left), and the corresponding differential spectrum in\nb \u2212\u2192 Xs \u03b3 (right) as computed by DGE with perturbative expansions of NLL (dotdashed blue line) and NNLL\n(full red line) accuracy. In the latter also the residue at u = 1/2 is fixed. The DGE spectra are both matched\nwith the full NLO. For comparison the conventional NNLL result is also shown (dashed green line).\n\nthe leading renormalon ambiguity in the exponent in SPT (mb /N ; \u03bc) is indeed equal in magnitude\nand opposite in sign to the one in the pole mass [15, 16], confirming the cancelation in Eq. (8).\nReturning to the observable, the replacement of the perturbative soft function SPT (mb /N ; \u03bc)\nin Eq. (2) by S(MB /N ; \u03bc) of Eq. (8), corresponding to the quark distribution is the meson, yields\nthe physical spectral moments defined in Eq. (5):\n\u0393N = H(mb ) Sud(N, mb ) e\u2212(N \u22121)\u039b\u0304/MB F((N \u2212 1)\u039b/MB ).\n|\n\n{z\n\n(9)\n\n}\n\nleading renormalon cancels out\n\nThese moments are free of the leading renormalon ambiguity. Given our limited knowledge of\ndynamic power corrections, as a first approximation it is sensible to neglect them altogether by\nsetting F \u2243 1. This leads to the second inverse\u2013Mellin formula in Eq. (4), which is nothing but\nresummed perturbation theory.\nIn practice, the application of DGE requires evaluating the integral in Eq. (6) despite incomplete knowledge of the anomalous dimensions of both the soft and the jet functions. What\nwe currently know about the exponent includes [8]:\n\u2022 The analytic expressions in the large\u2013\u03b20 limit [14] for BS (u) and BJ (u) given by Eq. (7).\n\u2022 NNLO (i.e. O(u2 )) perturbative expressions in QCD [8, 14] for both BS (u) [9, 17] and\nBJ (u) [13].\n\u2022 The normalization of the leading renormalon corresponding to the value of BS (u) at\nu = 1/2. This value was determined [8], using the cancellation, based on the u = 1/2\nrenormalon residue in the pole mass, which has been computed [8, 19] with a few percent\naccuracy from the NNLO perturbative expansion of the ratio between the pole mass and\nmMS\nb , taking into account the known structure of the singularity [20].\nThis information is sufficient [8] to constrain the moments up to N \u223c 20 fairly well. This is\ndemonstrated in Fig. 2. The most important source of remaining uncertainty arises from the\nunknown behavior of BS (u) away from the origin, and in particular, for u > 1/2. The stability\nreflected in Fig. 2 stands in sharp contrast with the situation we encountered at fixed logarithmic\naccuracy (Fig. 1), where the leading renormalon is untamed.\nLooking at Fig. 2 one immediately observes that the support properties have changed. While\nat any order in perturbation theory the result is identically zero for E\u03b3 > mb /2, upon taking the\n\n\fBR[B\u2192 Xs\u03b3 , E\u03b3>E0]\u00d7 10 3\n\n0.45\n0.4\n\n0.35\n0.3\n\n0.25\nNNLL-DGE:\n\u039b=0.355 GeV\n\u039b=0.405 GeV\n\u039b=0.455 GeV\n\n0.2\n0.15\n0.1\n\nBaBar data\nMB/2\n\n0.05\n0\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\n2\n\n2.2\n\n2.4\n\n2.6\n\n2.8\nE0[GeV]\n\nFigure 3: The partial B\u0304 \u2212\u2192 Xs \u03b3 BF with E\u03b3 > E0 as computed by DGE compared with new data from BaBar.\nInner and total error bars on the data points show systematic and statistical plus systematic errors (added linearly),\nrespectively. The three theory curves shown (indicated on the plot by the corresponding values for \u039b\u0304) correspond\nto different input values for mbMS that roughly cover the uncertainty range on this parameter. Note that the overall\nnormalization of the theoretical BF, which is fixed here to its central value of BF(E\u03b3 > E0 = mb /20) = 3.73*10\u22124 ,\nhas \u223c 10% uncertainty.\n\nPV in Eq. (6) the distribution becomes non-zero there. The E\u03b3 = mb /2 boundary is a direct\nconsequence of the assumption that the initial b quark is on-shell. This inherent limitation of\nperturbation theory is removed upon defining the sum of the series in moment space by PV.\nRemarkably, the PV result tends to zero near the physical endpoint. This, together with the\nobserved stability, suggests that in this formulation the dynamical power corrections associated\nwith the Fermi motion (F), which were neglected here, are indeed small.\n4\n\nComparison with data\n\nExperimentally\u2013favored observables are the partial branching fraction (BF) for E\u03b3 > E0 ,\n\u0393B\u0304\u2212\u2192Xs \u03b3 (E\u03b3 > E0 )\nBF \u2261\n;\n\u0393B\u0304\u2212\u2192anything\n\n\u0393(E\u03b3 > E0 ) \u2261\n\nZ\n\nE0\n\ndE\u03b3\n\nd\u0393(E\u03b3 )\n,\ndE\u03b3\n\n(10)\n\nwhere the cut value E0 is above 1.8 GeV, as well as the first few spectral moments defined over\nsimilarly limited range of photon energies:\n\nD\u0010D\n\nE\u03b3\n\nE\n\nE\u03b3 >E0\n\nD\n\nE\u03b3\n\n\u2212 E\u03b3\n\nE\n\nE\u03b3 >E0\n\n\u0011n E\n\nE\u03b3 >E0\n\n\u2261\n\u2261\n\nZ\n\n1\nd\u0393(E\u03b3 )\nE\u03b3 ,\ndE\u03b3\n\u0393(E\u03b3 > E0 ) E0\ndE\u03b3\nZ\n\u0011n\nd\u0393(E\u03b3 ) \u0010D E\n1\nE\u03b3 E\u03b3 >E0 \u2212 E\u03b3 .\ndE\u03b3\n\u0393(E\u03b3 > E0 ) E0\ndE\u03b3\n\n(11)\n(12)\n\nMeasurements of the average energy defined in Eq.

Since these power corrections are\ncontrolled by the soft scale mb /N , they become increasingly important with increasing E0 .\nIn order to test the theory and, eventually, determine these power corrections it is therefore\nuseful [8] to compare the theoretical calculation with data as a function of E0 . Such comparison\nwas done for the first time during the Moriond meeting, following the talk by J.J. Walsh [22]\nwho presented new (and preliminary) results from Babar; see Figs. 3 and 4.\n5\n\nConclusions\n\nWe presented a new approach to inclusive decay spectra in QCD and its application to the\nB\u0304 \u2212\u2192 Xs \u03b3 spectrum. Our method, Dressed Gluon Exponentiation, incorporates renormalon\nresummation as well as Sudakov resummation and uses the PV prescription to separate between\ncomputable perturbative contributions and non-perturbative power corrections, which become\nimportant near the endpoint.\nWe have shown that, despite the apparent infrared sensitivity which shows up as divergence\nof the perturbative expansion in Eq. (3), the predictive power of resummed perturbation theory\nis high. This is reflected, for example, in the stability of the DGE result shown in Fig. 2.\nA key property underlying this predictive power is the exact cancellation of the leading infrared\nrenormalon ambiguity [14]. This cancellation can be understood as a manifestation of the\ninfrared\u2013 and collinear\u2013safety of the physical spectral moments at power accuracy.\nIn the calculation of the spectrum by Eq. (4) the leading renormalon cancellation is realized\nby using the same prescription when defining the sum in the Sudakov exponent and when\ncomputing the quark pole mass which sets the overall energy scale. Renormalon resummation in\nboth these quantities is of course imperative for this cancellation to take place. The final result\nfor the spectrum is prescription independent as far as this leading renormalon is concerned.\nHaving neglected higher power corrections on the soft scale, our result does depend on using\nthe PV prescription for higher renormalon singularities. While we do not assign to the chosen\nregularization any physical meaning, we find the PV prescription particularly useful. Specifically,\nthe PV\u2013regularized spectrum shares the following key properties with the physical spectrum:\n(a) the moments are real valued, (b) the resummed spectrum smoothly extends beyond the\nperturbative endpoint and, quite remarkably, tends to zero for E\u03b3 = (mb + O(\u039b)) /2, close to\nMB /2. This suggest that in this formulation power corrections are indeed small.\n\n\fFinally, as shown in Figs. 3 and 4, there is good agreement between the theoretical predictions\nand data from the B factories for both the partial BF and the first two spectral moments over\nthe entire range of cuts where data is available. Fits can readily be performed to measure\nand to put bounds on the dynamical power corrections, which were so far neglected in\nmMS\nb\nthis approach. Finally, this successful comparison with data shows that prospects are good for\nprecision determination of Vub from charmless semileptonic decays using DGE.\nAcknowledgments\nEG wishes to thank Vladimir Braun, Gregory Korchemsky and Arkady Vainshtein for very\ninteresting discussions.
