Introduction\nOne of the most fundamental questions that\nstill remains open in the understanding of AGB\nstellar evolution is the interpretation of the 'Orich AGB sequence'. It has been shown by several authors that this sequence reflects the increase of optical thickness of the circumstellar envelope as the star evolves along the AGB\n(e.g. Bedijn 1987; Volk & Kwok 1988).\nHowever, this increase can be interpreted\nin two different ways:\ni) evolutionary sequence: every star would\nstart the AGB phase at the blue end of this sequence, and would later move while increasing its mass-loss rate until reaching the red extreme at the end of the AGB;\nii) mass sequence: their different location\nwould be just a consequence of their different\ninitial mass, which would determine the massloss rate;\niii) A third interpretation was proposed, which\nSend offprint requests to: F.M.

The solid line is\nthe 'O-rich AGB sequence' (see text), and the IRAS\ncolours are defined as: [12]\u2212[25] = \u22122.5 log FF\u03bd\u03bd (12)\n(25)\nand [25]\u2212[60] = \u22122.5 log FF\u03bd\u03bd (25)\n.\n(60)\n\nis a combination of the previous ones: all AGB\nstars would move towards redder colours as\nthey increase their mass-loss rate, but only the\nmore massive stars would be able to reach the\nreddest end of the sequence.\n\n\f2\n\nJim\u00e9nez-Esteban: Stellar evolution and the 'O-rich AGB sequence'\n\nIn\ntwo\nprevious\nworks\n(Jim\u00e9nez-Esteban et al. 2005a,b), we have\nstudied a very large sample of OH/IR stars\nwith a very good coverage of the whole\n'O-rich AGB sequence' (Fig. 1). We also have\nphotometric information not only in the midand far-infrared but also in the near-infrared\nwhere the bluer objects have the maximum of\ntheir spectral energy distribution.\n\n2. Luminosity, distance and galactic\nheight\nBolometric fluxes were obtained by integrating\nthe photometric data available from the near infrared to the far infrared domain (2MASS, own\nphotometry, MSX and IRAS data), and extrapolating both toward shorter and longer wavelengths. The typical uncertainty is \u2248 40%.\nWe selected from our sample 41 extremely\nred OH/IR stars detected in the direction\nof the Galactic Bulge, and assumed a common distance (8 kpc) to all them. The range\nof absolute luminosities obtained (Fig. 2) is\nstrongly peaked around 3 500 L\u2299 , in agreement with those found by other authors\nusing different OH/IR star samples in the\nbulge with very different (bluer) colours (e.g.\nWood et al. 1998; Blommaert et al. 1998) or\nusing samples located in different parts of the\nGalaxy (Knauer et al. 2001). Then we conclude that the luminosity function may be similar throughout the Galaxy and not very dependent on the colours of the stars selected.\nOur subsample of OH/IR stars in the Galactic\nBulge is dominated by relative low mass stars,\nso, these stars can also reach the red part of the\n'O-rich AGB sequence'.\nWe estimated the galactic height for the rest\nof OH/IR stars by simply assuming a common\nand constant luminosity LOH/IR of 3 500 L\u2299 for\nall them.\n\n3. Interpretation of the 'O-rich AGB\nsequence'\nIn order to have a good descriptor for the\nwhole 'O-rich AGB sequence', we have used\nthe parametrization introduced by the following equations:\n\nFig. 2. Absolute bolometric luminosity in thousands of L\u2299 of the OH/IR stars belonging to the\nGalactic Bulge population.\n\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fd\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n[25]\u2212[60] = \u22122.42 + 0.72 \u03bb \uf8fe\n[12]\u2212[25] = 0.912 Ln \u03bb\n\nEach point of the 'O-rich AGB sequence'\ncan then be associated with a given value of \u03bb,\nand each star is then assigned a \u03bb value which\ncorresponds to the nearest point in the 'O-rich\nAGB sequence'.\n\nFig. 3. Galactic height distribution as a function of\n\u03bb derived for all the sources in the sample, excluding\nthe Galactic Bulge OH/IR stars (LOH/IR = 3 500 L\u2299\nassumed).\n\nFig. 3 shows the galactic height in absolute\nvalue derived as a function of the \u03bb parameter.\nWe found a very clear correlation, which implies that the redder part of the 'O-rich AGB\nsequence' must be populated mainly with objects of higher mass. In addition, we found a\n\n\fJim\u00e9nez-Esteban: Stellar evolution and the 'O-rich AGB sequence'\n\nsimilar correlation between vexp and \u03bb. Note\nthat assuming a different luminosity would just\nchange the scale of the y-axis.\nThe above results are only consistent with\nan evolutionary scenario in which all OH/IR\nstars would start the AGB phase, independent\nof their progenitor mass, in the bluer part of the\n'O-rich AGB sequence' and then they would\nevolve toward redder colors, although only the\nmore massive stars would reach the very end\nof the sequence.\nIn order to further characterise the stars\npopulating the 'O-rich AGB sequence', we\nhave divided the sequence in bins of \u03bb and determined the galactic scale height H associated\n(Fig. 4). Then we have classified all the OH/IR\nstars in our sample in 5 main groups.\n\n3\n\nThe 'transition subsample' (1.2 < \u03bb \u2264 1.8;\nH = 287 pc) populates the region in which\nOH/IR stars become optically thick. These\nOH/IR stars are the result of the evolution\nof intermediate period (300 - 500 days) Miras\n(Jura et al. 1993), will probably transform into\nC-rich AGB stars (Groenewegen et al. 1992),\nand must be the progenitors of high mass (Crich) Type II PNe (Maciel & Dutra 1992).\nThe 'red subsample' (1.8 < \u03bb \u2264 3.0;\nH = 193 pc) is formed by OH/IR stars with\noptically thick circumstellar envelope. These\nstars are probaly undergoing Hot Botton\nBurning proces, and should be the progenitors\nof Type I PNe (Maciel & Dutra 1992).\nThe 'extremely red subsample' (3.0 < \u03bb;\nH = 48 pc) is identified as the group containing the most massive OH/IR stars in our sample. They should be the precursors of the socalled OHPNe, heavily obscured OH/IR stars\nwith radiocontinuum emission that have been\nproposed to be infrared PNe.\n\nReferences\n\nFig. 4. Galactic scale height distribution as a function of the \u03bb parameter for all the sources in the sample, excluding the Galactic Bulge.\n\nThe 'extremely blue subsample' (\u03bb < 0.6;\nH = 536 pc) is dominated by OH/IR stars that\ncan be identified as the result of the evolution of low mass optically bright short period\n(<\n\u223c 300 days) Miras (Jura 1994). These OH/IR\nstars should be the progenitors of so-called\nType III PNe (Maciel & Dutra 1992).\nThe 'blue subsample' (0.6 < \u03bb \u2264 1.2;\nH = 344 pc) is mainly formed by OH/IR\nstars identified as the result of the evolution\nof intermediate period (\u2248 300 days) Miras\n(Wood & Cahn 1977). These OH/IR stars\nshould be the progenitor of low mass (O-rich)\nType II PNe (Maciel & Dutra 1992).\n\nBedijn, P.
