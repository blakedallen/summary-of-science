Examples include\nenergy localization and propagation,1\u20133 discrete solitons,4,5 chemical reactions,6 nonequilibrium phase transitions,7,8 stochastic resonance,9,10 synchronization,11 brain dynamics12 and\nmany others. A special case of that model, a chain of charged particles that interact via the\nCoulomb interaction, also has a variety of applications. In particular, if the charges have the\nsame sign and are confined by a trapping potential, it describes the so-called one-dimensional\nCoulomb crystals, i.e., a crystallized structure of ions in a linear trap formed by external\nfocusing fields.13\u201315 If neighboring charges have opposite signs and a repulsive interaction\nexists between particles, then a such chain represents a relevant model for one-dimensional\nionic crystals. It seems that those models can be useful also for the study of one-dimensional\ncrystals within carbon nanotubes.16,17\nDuring the last decade, much attention was devoted to the transport properties of particles in thermal ratchets, i.e., spatially periodic stochastic models exhibiting noise-induced\nmacroscopic transport.18\u201327 The ratchet effect or stochastic transport in asymmetric potentials is important for biological motors,28,29 separation techniques,30 surface smoothing31 and\nvortex density reduction,32 to name a few. Most studies of ratchets, including deterministic\nones,33,34 i.e., ratchets without internal and external noises, have been performed for a single\nparticle. However, examples of coupled particles35,36 and vortices37 show that their collective\ninteractions can significantly modify the transport properties from the single particle case.\nTo our knowledge, the transport properties of a chain of strongly coupled charged particles\nin deterministic ratchets have not been studied at all.\nIn this paper, we study the equilibrium, oscillatory and transport properties of a chain\nwhere the neighboring particles have the same mass and opposite charges. Particles interact\nwith each other via both the Coulomb interaction and a repulsive interaction that depends\non the interparticle distance as |xi \u2212 xj |\u2212r (xi = xi (t) is the coordinate of the ith particle,\nr > 1). In Sec. II, we consider the ground state of such a chain depending on the exponent\nr. Three different states of a chain, namely, a periodic chain with equidistant particles, a\nperiodic chain with non-equidistant particles, and a chain with infinite period, are analyzed,\nand the interparticle distances and the chain energies as functions of r are calculated. In\n2\n\n\fcontrast to intuitive expectations, we show that there is a critical value of the exponent,\nr = r2 \u2248 2.799, such that for r > r2 the minimum energy occurs for a chain with equidistant\nparticles, and for r < r2 the minimum energy occurs for a chain with infinite period.\nPropagation of longitudinal waves in a chain with equidistant particles, its stability with\nrespect to small displacement of particles from their equilibrium positions, and forced vibrations of particles under action of an alternating electric field are studied in Sec. III. We derive\nthe set of equations that describe small oscillations of the particles, find the phonon spectrum and its asymptotics near the center and boundary of the Brillouin zone, and calculate\nthe amplitude of forced vibrations. We show that the spectrum consists of one branch; on\nthe boundary of the Brillouin zone it has a non-analyticity which is caused by the long-range\naction of the Coulomb interaction, and a chain is stable only if r > r1 \u2248 2.779.\nThe deterministic transport of a chain is studied in Sec. IV. We consider the case when the\nratchet potential is charge independent, and a chain is driven by a longitudinal alternating\nelectric field. We find the average velocity of a chain and analyze in detail its dependence on\nthe parameters characterizing the interparticle interactions, ratchet potential and alternating\nelectric field. Concluding remarks are contained in Sec. V, and some technical details are\ngiven in the Appendixes.\n\nII.\n\nGROUND STATE\n\nWe consider a chain of particles which have the same mass M and any neighboring\nparticles have opposite charges, i.e., qi+1 = \u2212qi and |qi | = q (the index i labels the particles).\nWe assume that in addition to the Coulomb interaction a repulsive interaction exists between\nthe particles. In analogy to ionic crystals,38 we choose a repulsive interaction that depends\non a power of the interparticle distance |xi \u2212 xj |, and write the total interaction energy of\na chain in the form\nWint =\n\n1 X\u2032 qi qj\nb X\u2032\n1\n+\n.\n2 i,j |xi \u2212 xj | 2 i,j |xi \u2212 xj |r\n\n(2.1)\n\nHere b is a dimensioned parameter characterizing the strength of the repulsive interaction,\nand the primes on the summation signs indicate the absence of self-interaction terms, i.e.,\ni 6= j. To prevent the unbounded contraction of a chain, we require r > 1.\nIf a chain is periodic in equilibrium (see Fig. 1), then the coordinates of the positive and\n\u2212\nnegative charges are written as np + x+\nn and np + a + xn , respectively. Here p is the chain\n\n3\n\n\fperiod, n (n = 0, \u00b11, ..., \u00b1\u221e) numbers the chain cells which contain two particles, a is the\n\n+\n\u2212\n\u2212\ninterparticle equilibrium distance in the cells (a < p), and x+\nn = xn (t) and xn = xn (t) are\n\nthe displacements of positive and negative charges from their equilibrium positions. With\nthese definitions Eq. (2.1) reads\nWint\n\nq 2 X\u2032\n2\n= \u2212\n\u2212\n2 n,m |(n \u2212 m)p \u2212 a + x+\nn \u2212 xm |\n1\n\u2212\n+\n|(n \u2212 m)p + x+\nn \u2212 xm |\n#\n1\n\u2212\n\u2212\n|(n \u2212 m)p + x\u2212\nn \u2212 xm |\nX\n1\n\u2212q 2\n+\n\u2212\nn |a \u2212 xn + xn |\n\"\n1\nb X\u2032\n+\n+ r\n2 n,m |(n \u2212 m)p + x+\nn \u2212 xm |\n\"\n\n#\n\n1\n+\n\u2212 r\n|(n \u2212 m)p + x\u2212\nn \u2212 xm |\nX\n1\n,\n+b\n+\n\u2212 r\nn,m |(n \u2212 m)p \u2212 a + xn \u2212 xm |\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhere summation on n and m is taken over all integers. Note also that the particles cannot\n+\n\u2212\n\u2212\nmove past each other, and therefore the conditions a > x+\nn \u2212 xn and p \u2212 a > xn \u2212 xn+1 must\n\nhold for all n and t.\n\u2212\nIn equilibrium x+\nn = xn = 0, and Eq. (2.2) is reduced to the form\n(0)\n\n\u221e\nq2\n1\nq2 X\n1\n2\n\u2212N\n+\n\u2212\n2a\n2p n=1 n \u2212 \u03b1 n + \u03b1 n\nb\n1\nb X\n+N r \u03b6(r) + N r\n,\np\n2p n |n + \u03b1|r\n\n\u0014\n\nWint = \u2212N\n\n\u0015\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhere N is the number of particles in a chain (N \u2192 \u221e), \u03b1 = a/p (0 \u2264 \u03b1 < 1), and\n\u03b6(r) =\n\nP\u221e\n\n\u2212r\nn=1 n\n\n(0)\n\nis the Riemann zeta function. Taking into account that the energy Wint\n\nis invariant with respect to the replacement of \u03b1 by 1 \u2212 \u03b1, we conclude that such chains\nare equivalent. Therefore, the permissible values of \u03b1 can be restricted by the condition\n0 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 1/2.\nDefining the dimensionless parameter \u03b2 = p/l (0 < \u03b2 \u2264 \u221e) and the length scale l =\n(0)\n\n(b/q 2 )1/(r\u22121) , we can rewrite Eq. (2.3) as Wint = N(q 2 /l)U0 (\u03b1, \u03b2), where\nU0 (\u03b1, \u03b2) = \u2212\n\n\u221e\n\u03b12 X\n\u03b6(r)\n1\n1\n\u2212\n+ r\n2\n2\n2\u03b1\u03b2\n\u03b2 n=1 n(n \u2212 \u03b1 )\n\u03b2\n\n4\n\n\f+\n\n1\n1 X\n2\u03b2 r n |n + \u03b1|r\n\n(2.4)\n\nis the dimensionless chain energy per particle (for another representation of U0 (\u03b1, \u03b2) see\nAppendix A). The equilibrium values of \u03b1 and \u03b2 are defined by the set of equations\n\u2202U0 (\u03b1, \u03b2)/\u2202\u03b1 = 0 and \u2202U0 (\u03b1, \u03b2)/\u2202\u03b2 = 0, which are written as\n\u221e\n1\n2\u03b1 X\nr X n+\u03b1\nn\n\u2212\n\u2212\n= 0,\n2\u03b12 \u03b2\n\u03b2 n=1 (n2 \u2212 \u03b12 )2 2\u03b2 r n |n + \u03b1|r+2\n\u221e\n2 X\n\n1\n\u03b1\n+ 2\n2\n2\u03b1\u03b2\n\u03b2\n+\n\nX\nn\n\nn=1\n\nn(n2\n\n1\n|n + \u03b1|r\n\n(2.5)\n\nr\n1\n\u2212 r+1 2\u03b6(r)\n2\n\u2212 \u03b1 ) 2\u03b2\n\n!\n\n= 0.\n\n(2.6)\n\nAnalysis shows that these equations have three solutions: \u03b1 = \u03b1s (r) and \u03b2 = \u03b2s (r)\n(s = 1, 2, 3). Below we find \u03b1s (r) and \u03b2s (r), and calculate the chain equilibrium energies Us (r) = U0 (\u03b1s (r), \u03b2s (r)). For illustrative purposes we introduce also the parameters\n\u03b3s (r) = \u03b1s (r)\u03b2s (r), which define the equilibrium values of the parameter \u03b3 = \u03b1\u03b2 = a/l.\n\nA.\n\nFirst solution\n\nFor \u03b1 = 1/2 (p = 2a), i.e., for a chain with equidistant particles, the series in Eqs.

Indeed, using standard series,39\nwe find with linear accuracy in \u03b5 = 1/2 \u2212 \u03b1 (\u03b5 \u2192 0):\n\u221e\nX\n\nn\n\u2212 \u03b1 2 )2\nn=1\nX n+\u03b1\nr+2\nn |n + \u03b1|\n\u221e\nX\n1\n2\n2\nn=1 n(n \u2212 \u03b1 )\nX\n1\nr\nn |n + \u03b1|\n(n2\n\n= 2 \u2212 2[7\u03b6(3) \u2212 6]\u03b5,\n\n(2.7)\n\n= 2(r + 1)(2r+2 \u2212 1)\u03b6(r + 2)\u03b5,\n\n(2.8)\n\n= 4(2 ln 2 \u2212 1) \u2212 8(3 \u2212 4 ln 2)\u03b5,\n\n(2.9)\n\n= 2(2r \u2212 1)\u03b6(r).\n\n(2.10)\n\nAccording to these formulas, U0 (1/2, \u03b2) is written as\n2\n2\nU0 (1/2, \u03b2) = \u2212 ln 2 +\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\n\n5\n\n!r\n\n\u03b6(r),\n\n(2.11)\n\n\fat \u03b1 = 1/2 Eq. (2.5) is satisfied identically, i.e., \u03b11 (r) = 1/2, and Eq. (2.6), which at \u03b1 = 1/2\nis equivalent to the equation dU0 (1/2, \u03b2)/d\u03b2 = 0, yields\nr\u03b6(r)\n\u03b21 (r) = 2\nln 2\n\n!1/(r\u22121)\n\n.\n\n(2.12)\n\nSubstituting \u03b2 = \u03b21 (r) into Eq.

To gain more insight into the behavior of these functions near r = \u221e and r = 1, we\ndefine the limiting values of those functions as r \u2192 \u221e and their asymptotics as r \u2192 1. Tak-\n\ning into account that limx\u21920 xx = 1, limx\u21920 (1 + x)1/x = e, \u03b6(\u221e) = 1, and \u03b6(r) \u223c (r \u2212 1)\u22121 as\n\nr \u2192 1, we obtain from Eq. (2.12) \u03b21 (\u221e) = 2 and \u03b21 (r) = 2e(\u01eb ln 2)\u22121/\u01eb \u2192 \u221e as \u01eb = r\u22121 \u2192 0,\nand from Eq. (2.13) U1 (\u221e) = \u2212 ln 2 and U1 (r) \u223c \u2212e\u22121 (\u01eb ln 2)1+1/\u01eb \u2192 0 as \u01eb \u2192 0. Thus, if\n\nr \u2192 1 then the functions \u03b21 (r) and U1 (r) go extremely fast to infinity and zero, respectively.\nFrom a physical point of view, this behavior of \u03b21 (r) and U1 (r) is caused by the unlimited\ngrowth of the total repulsive energy of a chain as r \u2192 1.\nB.\n\nSecond solution\n\nIf \u03b2 6= \u221e, then we eliminate \u03b2 from Eq.

According to the results of the previous subsection,\nEq. (2.14) always has the solution \u03b1 = 1/2, i.e., \u03b11 (r) = 1/2. To determine if Eq. (2.14) has\nsolutions on the interval (0, 1/2), we find first the asymptotics of its left-hand side, denoted\nby Lr (\u03b1), as \u03b1 \u2192 0 and \u03b1 \u2192 1/2. If \u03b1 \u2192 0, then\nLr (\u03b1) \u223c [\u03b1\u22122 \u2212 4\u03b6(3)\u03b1][\u03b1\u2212r + 2\u03b6(r)]\n\u2212[\u03b1\u22121 + 2\u03b6(3)\u03b12]\u03b1\u2212(r+1) ,\n6\n\n(2.15)\n\n\fand we obtain different asymptotics of Lr (\u03b1) for different values of r:\n\nLr (\u03b1) \u223c\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\n\u22126\u03b6(3)\u03b1\u2212(r\u22121) ,\n\nr > 3,\n\n\u22122\u03b6(3)\u03b1\u22122,\n\nr = 3,\n\n+4\u03b6(r)\u03b1\u22122,\n\nr < 3.\n\n(2.16)\n\nUsing Eqs. (2.7)\u2013(2.10), as \u03b1 \u2192 1/2 we obtain\nLr (\u03b1) \u223c \u22122r+3 \u03b6(r)F (r)\u03b5,\n\n(2.17)\n\nwhere\nF (r) = 4(1 \u2212 2\u2212r\u22122 )(r + 1) ln 2\n\n\u03b6(r + 2)\n\u2212 7\u03b6(3)\n\u03b6(r)\n\n(2.18)\n\nis a monotone increasing function of r, and F (r) = 0 at r = r1 \u2248 2.779. Therefore, in the\nleft vicinity of the point \u03b1 = 1/2, the conditions Lr (\u03b1) > 0 and Lr (\u03b1) < 0 hold for r < r1\nand r > r1 , respectively. Using this fact and Eq. (2.16), we conclude that if r1 < r < 3, then\nLr (\u03b1) near the points \u03b1 = 0 and \u03b1 = 1/2 has different signs, and so Eq. (2.14) has at last\none solution \u03b12 (r) \u2208 (0, 1/2) satisfying the conditions \u03b12 (r) \u2192 1/2 as r \u2192 r1 and \u03b12 (r) \u2192 0\nas r \u2192 3. Numerical analysis shows that such a solution is unique, and Eq.

If r \u2192 3, then according to\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\nEq. (2.19) \u03b22 (r) \u223c 3/\u03b12 (r) \u2192 \u221e, and we obtain \u03b32 (3) = 3, U2 (3) = \u22121/3 3. The plots\nof the functions \u03b22 (r), \u03b32 (r), and U2 (r), which are defined for r \u2208 [r1 , 3], are also shown in\nFigs. 2\u20134. As is seen from Fig. 4, U2 (r) > U1 (r) for r1 < r \u2264 3, i.e., the equilibrium chain\nwith equidistant particles is energy-wise preferred compared to the equilibrium chain with\nnon-equidistant particles.\n\nC.\n\nThird solution\n\nA further solution of Eqs. (2.5) and (2.6) corresponds to the case when the period of the\nchain is infinite and the distance between particles in the cells is finite, i.e., when \u03b1 \u2192 0,\n7\n\n\f\u03b2 \u2192 \u221e, and \u03b1\u03b2 = \u03b3. In this case\nU0 (\u03b1, \u03b2) \u2261 U0 (\u03b3) = \u2212\n\n1\n1\n+ r,\n2\u03b3 2\u03b3\n\n(2.20)\n\nEq. (2.6) is satisfied identically, and Eq. (2.5) is reduced to the equation dU0 (\u03b3)/d\u03b3 = 0. Its\nsolution \u03b3 = \u03b33 (r), \u03b33 (r) = r 1/(r\u22121) , defines the equilibrium distance between the particles,\nand the equilibrium energy per particle is given by\nU3 (r) = \u2212\n\n\u0012 \u00131/(r\u22121)\n\nr\u22121 1\n2r\nr\n\n.\n\n(2.21)\n\nThe functions \u03b33 (r) and U3 (r) monotonically decrease as r grows from 1 to \u221e [U3 \u223c (r \u2212\n\u221a\n\u221a\n1)/2e \u2192 0 as r \u2192 1, U3 (3) = \u22121/3 3, U3 (\u221e) = \u22121/2, \u03b33 (1) = e, \u03b33 (3) = 3, \u03b33 (\u221e) = 1],\nand their plots are shown in Figs. 3 and 4. Comparing the functions U1 (r), U2 (r), and U3 (r),\nwe conclude that for r > r2 [r = r2 \u2248 2.799 is the solution of the equation U1 (r) = U3 (r)]\nthe minimum energy occurs for a chain with equidistant particles [p = 2a, a = l\u03b31 (r)], and\nfor r < r2 the minimum energy occurs for a chain with infinite period [p = \u221e, a = l\u03b33 (r)].\nNote also that a chain with non-equidistant particles has a slightly larger energy than other\nchains.\nNext we study the vibration properties of a chain with equidistant particles.\n\nIII.\nA.\n\nVIBRATION PROPERTIES\nDispersion relation\n\nAssuming that the condition |x\u00b1\nn | \u226a a holds for all particles, we expand the chain energy\n(0)\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\nWint in a power series of x\u00b1\nn /a with quadratic accuracy: Wint = Wint + Wint + Wint , where\n\nthe upper indices indicate the power of x\u00b1\nn .

According to Eq. (3.11), in this interval the\ndimensionless phonon spectrum consists of two branches, \u03c9\u03031 (\u03ba) and \u03c9\u03032 (\u03ba). It is easy to see\nthat on the interval [0, 1] the spectrum is given by\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 \u03c9\u03031 (\u03ba),\n\n\u03c9\u0303(\u03ba) = \uf8f4\n\n\uf8f3 \u03c9\u0303\n\n0 \u2264 \u03ba \u2264 1/2,\n\n2 (1 \u2212 \u03ba),\n\n(3.12)\n\n1/2 < \u03ba \u2264 1,\n\nand \u03c9\u0303(\u03ba) is continuous at \u03ba = 1/2. Indeed, for \u03ba = 1/2 Eq. (3.8) yields S(1/2) =\nP\n\np (\u22121)\n\np\n\nB\u03032p\u22121 . Replacing in this formula p by \u2212p + 1 and using the condition B\u0303n = B\u0303\u2212n ,\n\nwe obtain S(1/2) = \u2212\n\nP\n\np (\u22121)\n\np\n\nB\u03032p\u22121 . This implies that S(1/2) = 0, and Eq. (3.11) yields\n\n\u03c9\u03031 (1/2) = \u03c9\u03032 (1/2). Hence, the phonon spectrum on the interval [0, 1] is represented by\nthe single branch \u03c9\u0303(\u03ba).

This means that\nneighboring particles in a chain perform acoustical vibrations at \u03ba = 0 and optical ones at\n\u03ba = 1.\nTo find for r > r1 the asymptotics of \u03c9\u0303(\u03ba) as \u03ba \u2192 0 and \u03ba \u2192 1, we need to calculate the\nseries (3.16) and (3.17) with quadratic accuracy in \u03ba as \u03ba \u2192 0. This is not a problem for\nthe series \u03a6r+2 (\u03ba) and \u03a8r+2 (\u03ba) that arise from the repulsive interaction of particles, because\nexpanding the cosines in a power series of \u03ba to an accuracy of \u03ba2 we immediately obtain\n\u03a6r+2 (\u03ba) = \u03b6(r + 2) \u2212 2\u03c0 2 \u03b6(r)\u03ba2 ,\n\u03a8r+2 (\u03ba) = (1 \u2212 2\u2212r\u22122 )\u03b6(r + 2) \u2212\n\n(3.20)\n2\n\n\u03c0\n(1 \u2212 2\u2212r )\u03b6(r)\u03ba2.\n2\n(3.21)\n\nAs to the series \u03a63 (\u03ba) and \u03a83 (\u03ba) that arise from the Coulomb interaction, their calculation\nby this method is impossible since divergencies occur. To avoid this difficulty, we use their\nintegral representations obtained in Appendix B. These representations have the advantage\nthat the double integrals in Eqs. (B3) and (B6) can be easily calculated with arbitrary\n11\n\n\faccuracy as \u03ba \u2192 0. Specifically, if we use the approximate formulas ln[2 sin(y/2)] \u2248 ln y and\nln[tan(y/2)] \u2248 ln(y/2) (y \u226a 1), then Eqs. (B3) and (B6) yield\n\u03a63 (\u03ba) = \u03b6(3) \u2212 \u03c0 2 [3 \u2212 2 ln(2\u03c0\u03ba)]\u03ba2 ,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n7\n\u03c0\u03ba 2\n\u03c02\n\u03a83 (\u03ba) = \u03b6(3) \u2212\n3 \u2212 2 ln\n\u03ba.\n8\n8\n2\n\n(3.22)\n(3.23)\n\nSubstituting series (3.20)\u2013(3.23) into Eqs. (3.14) and (3.15), we find the main terms of\nthe asymptotic expansion of \u03c9\u0303(\u03ba) as \u03ba \u2192 0,\n\u03c9\u0303(\u03ba) \u223c\nand as \u03ba \u2192 1,\n\nv\nu\nu (r \u2212 1) ln 2\n\u03c0t\n\n\u03b313 (r)\n\n\u03ba,\n\n(3.24)\n\n\u03c02\n(1 \u2212 \u03ba)2 | ln(1 \u2212 \u03ba)|.\n(3.25)\n\u03c9\u0303(1)\u03b313 (r)\nAccording to these asymptotics, the long-wave part of the vibrational spectrum (for \u03ba \u226a 1)\n\u03c9\u0303(\u03ba) \u223c \u03c9\u0303(1) +\n\nhas the usual form, i.e., \u03c9\u0303(\u03ba) \u221d \u03ba. On the boundary of the Brillouin zone, the function \u03c9\u0303(\u03ba)\nhas a local minimum, \u03c9\u0303 \u2032 (1) = d\u03c9\u0303(\u03ba)/d\u03ba|\u03ba=1 = 0, and the short-wave part of the spectrum\n(for \u03ba \u223c 1) exhibits a non-analytic dependence on \u03ba. As Eqs. (3.22) and (3.23) show,\nthe non-analyticity of \u03c9\u0303(\u03ba) at \u03ba \u2192 1 is caused by the long-range action of the Coulomb\ninteraction.\nThe dependence of \u03c9\u0303(\u03ba) on \u03ba for different values of r is shown in Fig. 5. As is seen\nfrom this figure, \u03c9\u0303(\u03ba) is a non-monotonic function of \u03ba which has a unique maximum on\nthe interval (1/2, 1). As r decreases, its local minimum \u03c9\u0303(1) also decreases, and \u03c9\u0303(1) > 0\nfor r > r1 . Since the inequality \u03c9\u0303(1) > 0 implies that \u03c9\u0303(\u03ba) > 0 for all \u03ba 6= 0, the condition\nr > r1 is the stability criterion of a chain with respect to small displacements of particles\nfrom their equilibrium positions. Note that though for r1 < r < r2 a chain with infinite\nperiod is energy-wise preferred compared to a chain with equidistant particles, it is the latter\nwhich is stable. If r < r1 , then a region exists on the interval [0, 1] where \u03c9\u0303 2(\u03ba) < 0, and\ntherefore such chains are unstable. Finally, if r = r1 , then \u03c9\u0303(1) = 0, \u03c9\u0303 \u2032 (1) = \u2212\u221e, and the\nasymptotic of \u03c9\u0303(\u03ba) as \u03ba \u2192 1 has the form\n\u03c9\u0303(\u03ba) \u223c \u03c0\n\ns\n\nq\n2\n(1\n\u2212\n\u03ba)\n| ln(1 \u2212 \u03ba)|.\n\u03b313 (r1 )\n\n(3.26)\n\nIn this case the optical displacements of particles do not lead to an appearance of restoring\nforces. Therefore, to determine if a chain is stable or not at r = r1 , it is necessary to go\nbeyond the harmonic approximation.\n12\n\n\fC.\n\nForced vibrations\n\nWe briefly consider also the forced vibrations of particles under the action of the longitudinal alternating electric field E(t) = E cos \u03c90 t, where E and \u03c90 are the amplitude and\nfrequency of the alternating field, respectively. In such field the electric force qE cos \u03c90 t acts\non positive charges, and the force \u2212qE cos \u03c90 t acts on negative charges. If the friction force\n\n\u2212\u03bb\u1e8b\u00b1\nn (\u03bb is a damping coefficient) also acts on each particle, then the forced vibrations of\nparticles are described by the following system of motion equations:\n+\n2\n\u1e8d+\nn + 2\u03a9\u03bb \u1e8bn + \u03a9\n\nX\nm\n\n+ \u03a92\n\nX\n\nm6=n\n\n\u1e8d\u2212\nn\n\n+\n\n2\u03a9\u03bb \u1e8b\u2212\nn\n\n\u2212\nB\u03032(n\u2212m)\u22121 (x+\nn \u2212 xm )\n\n+\nB\u03032(n\u2212m) (x+\nn \u2212 xm ) = A cos \u03c90 t,\n\n(3.27)\n2\n\n+\u03a9\n\nX\n\nB\u03032(n\u2212m)+1 (x\u2212\nn\n\nm\n\n+ \u03a92\n\nX\n\nm6=n\n\n\u2212\n\nx+\nm)\n\n\u2212\nB\u03032(n\u2212m) (x\u2212\nn \u2212 xm ) = \u2212A cos \u03c90 t\n\n(\u03a9\u03bb = \u03bb/2M, A = qE/M). Symmetry of these equations suggests that we seek their solution\n\u2212\n2\nin the form x+\nn = x(t) and xn = \u2212x(t). Taking into account that \u03c9\u0303 (1) = 2\n\nP\u221e\n\np=1\n\nB\u03032p\u22121 , in\n\nthis case Eqs. (3.27) are reduced to the ordinary differential equation for a forced harmonic\noscillator\n\u1e8d(t) + 2\u03a9\u03bb \u1e8b(t) + \u03c9 2 (1)x(t) = A cos \u03c90 t.\n\n(3.28)\n\nIts steady-state solution, which describes the forced vibrations of particles, has the form\nx(t) = x0 cos(\u03c90 t \u2212 \u03c6), where\nA\nx0 = q\n[\u03c9 2 (1) \u2212 \u03c902]2 + 4\u03c902 \u03a92\u03bb\n\n(3.29)\n\nis the amplitude displacement of particles from their equilibrium positions, and tan \u03c6 =\n\u221a\n2\u03a9\u03bb \u03c9/[\u03c9 2(1) \u2212 \u03c902 ]. According to Eq. (3.29), if \u03c9(1) > 2\u03a9\u03bb , then the dependence of x0\n\non the driving frequency \u03c90 has resonance character; \u03c90 = [\u03c9 2 (1) \u2212 2\u03a92\u03bb ]1/2 is the resonance\nfrequency, and x0 = A/2\u03a9\u03bb [\u03c9 2 (1) \u2212 \u03a92\u03bb ]1/2 is the resonance amplitude.\n\n13\n\n\fIV.\n\nDETERMINISTIC TRANSPORT\n\nIn this section we study the transport properties of a chain whose particles are driven by\nthe longitudinal alternating electric field E(t) = Eh(t),\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 1,\n\n2k\u03c4 < t \u2264 2k\u03c4 + \u03c4,\n\nh(t) = \uf8f4\n\n\uf8f3 \u22121,\n\n(4.1)\n\n2k\u03c4 + \u03c4 < t \u2264 2k\u03c4 + 2\u03c4,\n\nand interact with the sawtooth (ratchet) potential V (x) that induces the force field f (x) =\n\u2212dV (x)/dx \u2261 f0 g(x), where\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\ng(x) = \uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\nc/(d \u2212 c),\n\u22121,\n\nmd + c < x \u2264 md + d,\n\n(4.2)\n\nmd < x \u2264 md + c.\n\nHere k and m run over all integers, \u03c4 is the half-period of E(t), f0 = | min f (x)|, and d is\nthe period of V (x) (see Fig. 6). The dynamics of particles in such a chain is described by\nthe system of equations (3.27) in which the right-hand sides A cos \u03c90 t and \u2212A cos \u03c90 t must\n\n\u2212\nbe replaced by Ah(t) + Rg(x+\nn ) and \u2212Ah(t) + Rg(xn ) (R = f0 /M), respectively. To simplify\n\nthe problem, we assume that the condition a = Ld (L is a natural number) holds, so that\nthe equilibrium positions of all particles coincide with the minima of V (x). In this case,\nunder the action of the electric field E(t) all positively charged particles and all negatively\n\u2212\ncharged particles move identically, i.e., x+\nn = w(t) and xn = u(t), and we obtain\n\n\u1e85 + 2\u03a9\u03bb \u1e87 + \u03c9 2 (1)(w \u2212 u) = Ah(t) + Rg(w),\n\n(4.3)\n\n2\n\n\u00fc + 2\u03a9\u03bb u\u0307 + \u03c9 (1)(u \u2212 w) = \u2212Ah(t) + Rg(u).\nDue to the periodicity of h(t) and g(x), the steady-state solution of Eqs. (4.3) satisfies\nthe conditions\nw(t + \u03c4 ) = u(t) + Kd,\n\nu(t + \u03c4 ) = w(t) + Kd,\n\n(4.4)\n\nwhere K is a whole number. It follows from these conditions that\nw(t + 2\u03c4 ) \u2212 w(t) = 2Kd,\n\nu(t + 2\u03c4 ) \u2212 u(t) = 2Kd,\n\n(4.5)\n\ni.e., for the period of h(t) all particles are displaced the same distance \u2206 = 2Kd. This fact\npermits us to define the average velocity of a chain as\nv\u2261\n\nw(2\u03c4 ) \u2212 w(0)\nd\n=K .\n2\u03c4\n\u03c4\n14\n\n(4.6)\n\n\fTo find v, we need to calculate \u2206 and in the general case solve Eqs. (4.3). These equations\nhave the important feature that we need to consider only the ratchet potentials with c > d/2.\nIndeed, the transformation c \u2192 d \u2212 c leads to the inverted potential Vin (x) = V (\u2212x) which\ngives rise to the reduced force field gin (x) = \u2212g(\u2212x). According to Eqs. (4.3), in such a\npotential the displacements win (t) and uin (t) of positive and negative charges from their\nequilibrium positions are governed by the equations of motion\n\u1e85in + 2\u03a9\u03bb \u1e87in + \u03c9 2 (1)(win \u2212 uin ) = Ah(t) \u2212 Rg(\u2212win ),\n\u00fcin + 2\u03a9\u03bb u\u0307in + \u03c9 2 (1)(uin \u2212 win ) = \u2212Ah(t) \u2212 Rg(\u2212uin ).\n\n(4.7)\n\nComparing these equations with Eq. (4.3), we obtain win (t) = \u2212u(t) and uin (t) = \u2212w(t).\nThis means that if for c > d/2 the solution of equations (4.3) is known, then their solution\nfor c < d/2 is known too. Using Eqs. (4.5) and (4.6), we find the chain velocity in the\ninverted potential vin = \u2212v, i.e., in the potentials Vin (x) and V (x) a chain drifts in the\nopposite directions with the same velocity. If c = d/2 then Vin (x) = V (x), both conditions\nvin = \u2212v and vin = v hold, and vin = v = 0. Hence, to study the transport properties of a\nchain, we indeed can consider only those ratchet potentials for which c > d/2. In this case,\na chain can drift only along the positive direction of the x axis and so K \u2265 0.\nNext we study the deterministic transport of a chain in the overdamped limit where\nEqs. (4.3) are reduced to\n2\u03a9\u03bb \u1e87 + \u03c9 2 (1)(w \u2212 u) = Ah(t) + Rg(w),\n\n(4.8)\n\n2\u03a9\u03bb u\u0307 + \u03c9 2 (1)(u \u2212 w) = \u2212Ah(t) + Rg(u).\nSince our aim is to find the chain velocity v, we need to solve Eqs. (4.8) only for t \u2208 (0, 2\u03c4 ).\nTo simplify the problem further, we assume that the conditions L \u226b K \u226b 1 and 1 < A/R <\nc/(d \u2212 c) hold. The former implies that the interparticle distance a is much larger than the\nchain displacement \u2206, which, in turn, is much larger than the potential period d. The latter\nshows that for h(t) > 0 (h(t) < 0) positive (negative) charges can overcome the potential\nbarriers of V (x) and they move along the positive direction of the x axis, whereas negative\n(positive) charges stay in the minima of V (x). After h(t) changes sign, the particles at\nrest begin to move, and the moving particles move to the appropriate minima of V (x) and\nstop there. Since the maximal distance that the moving particles travel after h(t) changes\nsign does not exceed c, i.e., this distance is much less than \u2206, we assume that the moving\n15\n\n\fparticles reach the corresponding minima of V (x) immediately as h(t) changes sign. Within\nthis approximation, the dynamics of positive and negative charges is described separately,\nand Eqs. (4.8) yield u(t) = 0 and\n2\u03a9\u03bb \u1e87 + \u03c9 2 (1)w = A + Rg(w)\n\n(4.9)\n\n[w(0) = \u2212\u2206/2, w(\u03c4 ) = \u2206/2] for t \u2208 (0, \u03c4 ), and w(t) = \u2206/2 and\n2\u03a9\u03bb u\u0307 + \u03c9 2 (1)(u \u2212 \u2206/2) = A + Rg(u)\n\n(4.10)\n\n[u(\u03c4 ) = 0, u(2\u03c4 ) = \u2206] for t \u2208 (\u03c4, 2\u03c4 ).\nTo calculate \u2206 we can use either Eq. (4.9) or Eq. (4.10). We take Eq. (4.9) as our starting\npoint and write it in the form\n\u1e87 + \u03b4w =\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\n\u03b82 ,\n\nmd + c < w \u2264 md + d,\n\n\u03b81 ,\n\nmd < w \u2264 md + c,\n\n(4.11)\n\nwhere \u03b4 = \u03c9 2 (1)/2\u03a9\u03bb , \u03b81 = (A \u2212 R)/2\u03a9\u03bb , \u03b82 = [A + Rc/(d \u2212 c)]/2\u03a9\u03bb , and m = \u2212K, \u2212K +\n1, ..., K \u2212 1. The solution of Eq. (4.11) depends on \u2206 and actually defines \u2206, because\nw(0) = \u2212\u2206/2 and w(\u03c4 ) = \u2206/2. We use this feature to derive the following equation (see\nAppendix C)\n\ne\u03b4t2K\n\n!\n\n!\n\n2\u03b81 \u2212 \u2206\u03b4\n2\u03b81 + \u2206\u03b4\nc\n\u0393\n+1 \u0393\n\u2212 +1\n2d\u03b4\n2d\u03b4\nd\n!\n!\n=\nc\n2\u03b81 \u2212 \u2206\u03b4\n2\u03b81 + \u2206\u03b4\n+1 \u0393\n\u2212 +1\n\u0393\n2d\u03b4\n2d\u03b4\nd\n!\n\n!\n\n2\u03b82 \u2212 \u2206\u03b4\n2\u03b82 + \u2206\u03b4\nc\n\u0393\n\u2212 +1 \u0393\n2d\u03b4\nd\n2d\u03b4\n!\n!\n\u00d7\nc\n2\u03b82 \u2212 \u2206\u03b4\n2\u03b82 + \u2206\u03b4\n\u2212 +1 \u0393\n\u0393\n2d\u03b4\nd\n2d\u03b4\n\n(4.12)\nfor the instant t = t2K that corresponds to a displacement of positive charges of \u2206 = 2Kd.\nAn increase of \u03c4 leads to the step-wise increase of t2K and K, and from Eq. (4.12) we obtain\nmax K = min\n\n(\"\n\n# \"\n\n\u03b81 + (d \u2212 c)\u03b4\n\u03b82\n,\nd\u03b4\nd\u03b4\n\nwhere [x] denotes the integer part of x.\n16\n\n#)\n\n,\n\n(4.13)\n\n\fReplacing in Eq. (4.12) t2K by \u03c4 , we obtain the approximate equation that defines \u2206 as\na function of \u03c4 . For \u03b4\u03c4 \u226b 1 it yields K \u2248 max K, and so in this case the chain velocity v is\ngiven by\nv=\n\n2d\nmax K.\n\u03c4\n\n(4.14)\n\nIt follows from this formula that v \u2192 0 as \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e and, according to Eq. (4.13), v depends\n\nweakly on d and v \u221d \u03c9 \u22122 (1). The last proportionality shows that the chain velocity strongly\n\ndepends on the interparticle interactions, and v is a decreasing function of r. [Note that the\npermissible values of r are not too close to r1 , since our assumptions imply that max K \u226a L\nholds.]\nIf K \u226a max K, then, using the asymptotic formula40\n\u0393(z + x)\n1\n= z x\u2212y 1 + (x \u2212 y)(x + y \u2212 1)\n\u0393(z + y)\n2z\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n(4.15)\n\n(z \u2192 \u221e), we reduce the equation for \u2206 to the form\ne\u03b4\u03c4 = 1 +\n\nc\n\u2206\u03b4 c \u2206\u03b4\n1\u2212\n.\n+\n\u03b81 d\n\u03b82\nd\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(4.16)\n\nSolving Eq.

Since 1 < A/R < c/(d \u2212c), for a given ratio A/R = \u03c3 (\u03c3 > 1) the parameter\nc/d must belong to the interval (\u03c3/(\u03c3 + 1), 1). On this interval, v is a decreasing function\nof c/d, and according to Eq.

We have shown that a chain with\nequidistant particles has minimum energy for r > r2 \u2248 2.799. For a such chain, we have\ncalculated its energy and period as functions of r, derived and analyzed in detail its phonon\n17\n\n\fspectrum, and established that it is stable with respect to small displacements of particles\nfrom their equilibrium positions only if r > r1 \u2248 2.779.\nWe have studied also the deterministic transport of a chain in the case when the particles\nare acted upon by both a longitudinal alternating electric field and a force field generated by\na ratchet potential. We have derived the set of equations that describes the chain transport,\nanalyzed the general properties of its solution, and calculated the chain velocity in the\noverdamped limit. If the period of the electric field is large enough, then the chain velocity\nstrongly depends on the interparticle interactions. Otherwise, i.e., if the period of the electric\nfield is small enough, the chain velocity does not depend on them.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\n\nWe are grateful to Werner Horsthemke for a critical reading of the manuscript and his\nvaluable comments.\n\nAPPENDIX A: ANOTHER FORM FOR U0 (\u03b1, \u03b2)\n\nUsing the representation40\nk\n1\n1 X\n\u03c8(z) = lim ln k \u2212 \u2212\nk\u2192\u221e\nz n=1 n + z\n\n\"\n\n#\n\n(A1)\n\nfor \u03c8(z) = d ln \u0393(z)/dz (\u0393(z) is the gamma function) and the definition\n\u03b6(r, z) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n1\nr\nn=0 (n + z)\n\n(A2)\n\nof the generalized zeta function \u03b6(r, z), we find\n\u221e \u0014\nX\n\nn=1\n\n1\n1\n2\n= 2\u03c8(1) \u2212 \u03c8(\u03b1) \u2212 \u03c8(\u2212\u03b1)\n+\n\u2212\nn\u2212\u03b1 n+\u03b1 n\n\n(A3)\n\n1\n= \u03b6(r, \u03b1) + \u03b6(r, 1 \u2212 \u03b1).\n|n + \u03b1|r\n\n(A4)\n\n\u0015\n\nand\nX\nn\n\nSubstituting Eqs.
