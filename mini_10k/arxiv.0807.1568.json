The ability\nto detect whether the operation has succeeded or not is crucial for practical application.\n\nIntroduction.-A quantum memory, a storage device\nthat can faithfully store and retrieve quantum state of\ntraveling light pulse, is requisite to long-distance quantum communication networks and distributed quantum\ncomputers [1\u20139]. By following the seminal protocol proposed by Duan et al. [3], significant advance has been\nmade in storing single photon by using atomic ensembles as storage mediums [10\u201325]. Early experiments\nusing atomic ensembles mainly focused on the storage\nand retrieval of single photon with the fixed polarization\n[12, 13]. Recent experiments show that single-photon polarization qubits can be stored in two atomic ensembles\n[16, 17]. However, above studies are thwarted by photon losses since one can't determine whether or not the\nincoming photon has been stored or lost. Fortunately,\nsuch unpredictable failure may be largely remedied by\na heralding feature that announces photon arrival and\nsuccessful storage without destroying the stored quantum state. In Ref. [26], a heralded storage has been\nachieved by means of a spontaneous Raman process that\ncan absorb a single-photon with arbitrary polarization\nand simultaneously emit a photon with fixed polarization. However, due to small spontaneous Raman scattering probability, the heralded storage occurs rarely, while\nits polarization state is restored with high fidelity. Cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) provides another\nideal interface between atoms and photons [4, 27\u201332].\nIn the initial proposal for the implementation of quantum networks in cavity QED [4], the quantum information of photons is encoded in the Fock basis, i.e., the\nzero- and one-photon Fock states [4, 30]. Ref. [32] proposed a robust method for transmitting entangled polarization state over long distances and teleportation of\natomic state via measurements of all four Bell states, using a novel method of sequential elimination.\nIn this paper, we propose a heralded quantum memory for arbitrary polarization state with a single atom\ntrapped in an optical cavity. Our scheme is based on\nquantum-state swap between single-photon pulse and\n\ne\n\nh\n(a)\n\n\u2020 Electronic\n\naddress: xbz@ustc.edu.cn\naddress: xmlin@fjnu.edu.cn\n\n(b)\n\nl\n\nr\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) (a) Schematic setup to reflect a single\nphoton pulse from one-sided cavity.

Numerical simulation results show that our scheme has a high success probability\nand the retrieved photon has so well-defined waveforms\nthat it is easy to interfere with other photons. We also\nshow that the scheme can allow the heralded quantum\nstate transfer, exchange and entanglement distribution\nbetween distant nodes. The ability to detect whether\nthe operation has succeeded or not, is crucial for practical application [2, 26].\nThe building block and numerical simulations.-As\nshown in Fig.1(a), our model consists of a single atom\ninside a one-sided optical cavity. The relevant atomic\nlevels are depicted in Fig. 1(b), the states |li and |ri correspond to two stable ground states, and |ei denotes an\nexcited state. The cavity supports two degenerate cavity\nmodes ah and av with different polarizations h and v.\nWe assume that the transitions |li \u2194 |ei and |ri \u2194 |ei\nare resonantly coupled to two cavity modes ah and av\nwith the strength gh and gv , respectively. The interaction between the atom and cavity modes is described by\nHI = gh |ei hl| ah + gv |ei hr| av + H.c.. The time evolutions of cavity modes ah and av are given by [4, 33, 34]\ni \u03ba\nh\n\u2032\n\u0227h(v) (t) = \u2212i ah(v) (t) , HI \u2212 ah(v) (t)\n2\n\u221a h(v)\n\u2212 \u03baain (t) ,\n(1)\nwhere HI = HI \u2212 i \u03b32e |ei he| [31, 35], \u03ba is the cavity decay\nrate for two cavity modes, and \u03b3e is spontaneous-emission\nh(v)\nrate of the excited state. The output operator aout (t) is\nh(v)\nconnected with the input operator ain (t) by the input\u2032\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\nv\n\nD\n\n\f2\n\u221a\nh(v)\nh(v)\noutput relation aout (t) = ain (t) + \u03baah(v) (t).\nIn this paper, two cases are considered: (i) the atom is\nprepared in the state |li ( or |ri), and a v-polarized (hpolarized) photon |vi (|hi) is injected. In this case, the\n\u2032\nHamiltonian HI does not work and the injected photon\nsees an empty cavity. Thus, the polarization of the input\nphoton is not changed and we have [33, 34]\naout (\u03c9) =\n\n\u2212\u03ba/2 \u2212 i\u03b4\nain (\u03c9) ,\n\u03ba/2 \u2212 i\u03b4\n\nh(v)\n\nv(h)\n\nT=10\n\n0.9\n\nT=20\nT=30\n\n0.8\n\nT=40\n\n0.7\n\nP\n\nT=50\nT=60\n\n0.6\n\nT=120\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n(2)\n\n0.3\n\n2\n\nwhere we assume that the center frequency of input\nphoton pulse \u03c90 is resonant with the cavity mode and\n\u03b4 = \u03c9 \u2212 \u03c90 . If \u03ba \u226b \u03b4, we have aout (\u03c9) \u2248 \u2212ain (\u03c9). Next\nwe consider the case (ii): the atom is prepared in the\nstate |li ( or |ri), and a h-polarized (v-polarized) photon\n|hi (|vi) is injected. In this case, taking the adiabatic\nlimit [31, 35], we can obtain the input-output relation\naout (\u03c9) = aout (\u03c9) + aout (\u03c9) ,\n\n1.0\n\n3\n\n4\n\nh(v)\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) The success probability P for the\nflip |li |hi \u2194 |ri |vi as a function of g/\u03ba for \u03baT =\n{10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 120}, on the assumption that \u03b3e = \u03ba\nand gh = gv =g.\n\n(3)\n\nwith\naout (\u03c9) = [1\u2212\n\n5\n\ng\n\nD\n\nE\n\nF\n\nG\n\n\u03ba\nh(v)\n(\u03c9) ,\n]a\n2\n2\n+ i\u03ba\u03b3e ) in\n\u03ba/(4gv(h)\n\u03ba/2 \u2212 i\u03b4 + 2gh(v)\n(4)\n\nand\ngh(v) \u03ba/gv(h)\nh(v)\n(\u03c9) .\na\n(\u03c9) =\n2\n2\n+ i\u03ba\u03b3e /2)] in\n\u03ba/(2gv(h)\n[\u03ba/2 \u2212 i\u03b4 + gh(v)\n(5)\nIt is seen from Eq.

Therefore, the polarization of the\n(\u03c9) \u2248\ninput photon is changed and we realize state flip operation |li |hi \u2194 |ri |vi.\nNow, we give a detailed analysis of this building block\nthrough numerical simulation with the Hamiltonian [31,\n35]\nX Z +\u03c9b\n\u2032\nH = HI +\n\u03c9d\u03c9\u0398\u2020\u0325 (\u03c9)\u0398\u0325 (\u03c9)\n\u0325=h,v \u2212\u03c9b\n\n+i\n\nr\n\nZ\n\u03ba X +\u03c9b\nd\u03c9[\u1e01 \u0398\u2020\u0325 (\u03c9) \u2212 \u1e01\u2020 \u0398\u0325 (\u03c9)], (6)\n2\u03c0\n\u2212\u03c9b\n\u0325=h,v\n\nwhere\n\u0398\u0325 (\u03c9)\nwith\nthe\nstandard\nrelation\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2020\n[\u0398\u0325 (\u03c9), \u0398\u0325 (\u03c9 )] = \u03b4(\u03c9\u2212\u03c9 ) denotes the one-dimensional\nfree-space mode coupled to the cavity modes.\nAssuming that the input single-photon\npulse is Gaush\n\u00012\n\u00012 i\n,\nsian pulse of the form f (t) \u221d exp \u2212 t \u2212 T2 / T5\nwhere T is the pulse duration. We first consider abovementioned case (ii) that a polarized photon |hi (|vi) is\ninjected into cavity and the atom is prepared in state\n|li (|ri). Let P be the success probability for the flip\n|li |hi \u2194 |ri |vi. In Fig. 2, we plot P versus the normalized cavity coupling rate g/\u03ba, assuming \u03b3e = \u03ba, with different the pulse width: \u03baT = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 120}.\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0013\u0011\u0015\n\n\u0013\u0011\u0017\n\nW\u00127\n\n\u0013\u0011\u0019\n\n\u0013\u0011\u001b\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0013\u0011\u0015\n\n\u0013\u0011\u0017\n\n\u0013\u0011\u0019\n\n\u0013\u0011\u001b\n\n\u0014\n\nW\u00127\n\nFIG. 3: (Color online) The shape functions |f (t)| for the input\npulse (solid curve) and the output pulse (dashed curve) for the\ncase \u03baT = (a) 10, (b) 30, (c) 60, and (d) 90. Other common\nparameters: \u03b3e = \u03ba, gh = gv =g, and g = 2\u03ba.\n\nFrom Fig. 2, we see that when g \u2265 2\u03ba and \u03baT \u2265 60\nthe success probability can be up to 90%. Fig. 3 shows\nthat when \u03baT \u2265 60 the output pulse shapes |f (t)| almost\ncompletely overlap with the input pulse shapes. Then,\nwe consider the case (i) that a polarized photon |hi (|vi)\nis injected into cavity and the atom is in the state |ri\n(|li). In this case, the atom is decoupled from the cavity field, thus the influence of the atomic spontaneous\nemission can be ignored and the dominant noise is the\ndistortion between the output and the input pulse.

After the photon pulse\nis reflected by the cavity, the state of total system in the\nideal case will evolve into (\u2212\u03b7 |hi+\u03b6 |vi)\u2297(\u2212\u03b2 |li+\u03b1 |ri),\nwhich corresponds to quantum state exchange operation between photon and atom, apart from phase factors that can be eliminated by the appropriate subsequent logic operations [36]. We quantify the quality of\nswap gate through a numerical simulation, and the parameters are referred to Ref. [37], i.e., (g0 , \u03ba, \u03b3e )/2\u03c0 =\n(27, 4.8, 6)M Hz. Suppose that the initial state of system\nis given by |\u03a8(0)i = (|hi+|vi)\u2297(|li+|ri)/2, Fig. 5 shows\nthat the swap gate has a high fidelity and the variation\nof fidelity is about 0.01 for g varying from g0 to g0 /2.\nBased on above-mentioned swap operation, we consider the heralded quantum storage. Suppose that a pho-\n\nton is initially in arbitrary polarized state (\u03b1 |hi + \u03b2 |vi)\nand atom is prepared in the state |ri. After the photon pulse is reflected by the cavity, the state of system\nbecomes\n(\u03b1 |hi + \u03b2 |vi) \u2297 |ri \u2192 |hi \u2297 (\u03b2 |li \u2212 \u03b1 |ri).\n\n(7)\n\nDetection of the reflected photon in the state |hi heralds the mapping of the input polarization state onto\natom. We note that Fleischhauer et al. have proposed\nan interesting scheme for storing single-photon quantum\nstates by adiabatic evolution of dark states, which has a\nhigh success probability, but not be heralded [31]. For\ntransmitting entangled polarization state over long distances in realistic noisy channels, Ref. [32] proposed a\nrobust method for capturing photon in optical cavities,\nand storing it in atoms, in which they detected if the\natom has jumped out of the initial state, i.e., absorbed\na photon, using the fluorescence technique by driving a\ncycling transition from initial state of the atom to an\naccessorial excited state.\nThe approach for retrieving photonic states is similar\nto that for storing process. A photon pulse in the state\n|hi is reflected by the cavity, the state evolution of system\ncan be represented by\n|hi \u2297 (\u03b2 |li \u2212 \u03b1 |ri) \u2192 (\u03b1 |hi + \u03b2 |vi) \u2297 |ri .\n\n(8)\n\nAfter exchanging quantum states, the photonic qubit has\nbeen successfully retrieved and leaving atom in initial\nstate |ri for storage of another photon.\nQuantum communication protocols.-One application\nof our scheme is the heralded quantum state transfer\nand exchange between two atomic memories are shown\nin Fig. 6(a). Suppose that the initial state of a single photon pulse and two atomic memories is |\u03a6(0)i =\n|hi\u2297(\u03b1 |liA +\u03b2 |riA )\u2297|liB , where |\u03b8i\u03c7 (\u03b8 = l, r, \u03c7 = A, B)\ndenotes quantum state of the atom trapped in cavity \u03c7.\nThe photon pulse is sequentially reflected by the cavities\nA and B, the state of the combined system in the ideal\ncase will evolve into |vi \u2297 |riA \u2297 (\u03b1 |liB + \u03b2 |riB ). Detection of the photon in the state |vi heralds that quantum state transfer from cavity A to cavity B has been\nperformed successfully. If the initialEstate of the photon\u2032\natom system is prepared in \u03a6 (0) = |hi \u2297 (\u03b1 |liA +\n\u03b2 |riA )\u2297(\u03b6 |liB +\u03b7 |riB ), the photon pulse is sequentially\n\n\f4\nreflected by the cavities A and B, then reflected by the\ncavity A again. the state of combined system will evolve\ninto |hi \u2297 (\u03b6 |liA + \u03b7 |riA ) \u2297 (\u03b1 |liB + \u03b2 |riB ). After the\ndetection of the photon in the state |hi, one can known\nthe quantum states of the atoms trapped in cavities A\nand B have been directly exchanged.\nAnother immediate application is the heralded distribution of entanglement between two atomic memories, which is shown in Fig. 6(b). A single-photon\npulse in the state |vi is divided into two paths by a\n50/50 beam splitter (BS), one is reflected by a onesided optical cavity trapped an single atom with the\nquantum state |ri. The other is reflected by a mirror.\nThe state evolution of this\n\u221a process can be written as\n|vi |ri \u2192 (|vi |ri + |hi |li)/ 2, which is an atom-photon\nmaximal entangled state. Then the state of the photon\nis stored into another atomic memory by detection of\nthe reflected photon. After the successful generation of\nentanglement between two atomic memories within the\nattenuation length, one wants to extend the quantum\ncommunication distance. This is done through entanglement swapping [2, 3, 38, 39]. Suppose that we start with\ntwo pairs of entangled memories. First, one of each entangled pair is mapped into single photon with retrieval\noperation. Second, two photons from two pairs of entangled ensembles are performed Bell-state measurement\nwith two photon interference [40]. After an entangled\nstate has been established between two distant memories, we can use it in entanglement-based communication\nprotocols, such as quantum teleportation, cryptography,\nand Bell inequality detection with linear optics elements\n[3], since the quantum states between atomic memories\nand photons can be transferred in a reversible manner\n[1].\nNext we briefly address the experiment feasibility of\nthe proposed schemes. We consider a 87 Rb atom trapped\nin a one-sided Fabry\u2013Perot cavity [37]. The states |li and\n|ri correspond to |F = 1, m = \u22121i and |F = 1, m = 1i of\n5S1/2 ground levels, respectively, while |ei corresponds\nto |F = 1, m = 0i of 5P3/2 excited level. The relevant\ncavity QED parameters for this system are assumed as\n\n[1] Kimble H. J., nature 453 (2008) 1023.\n[2] Briegel H. J., D\u00fcr W., Cirac J. I., and Zoller P., Phys.\nRev.

Suppose that the average photon absorption rate in a fiber is 1 \u2212 e\u2212L/Latt ,\nwhere L is the length of the fiber and the channel attenuation length Latt \u223c 22km [39]. If the single-photon\ndetection efficiency is \u03b7d \u223c 0.95 [39], the success probability for heralded quantum state or generation of entanglement between two atomic memories with the distance L \u223c 10km is P1 \u223c P 2 \u03b7d e\u2212L/Latt \u223c 0.55. For\nquantum communication over long distance Lm = 2m L,\none needs mth (m = 1, 2,...,N) entanglement connection.\nThe total probability to create entanglement across two\ncommunication\nnodes\nY6 at a distance of 1280 km is about\nY6\n( 21 P 2 \u03b7d2 e\u2212L/Latt )6 \u223c 0.0002.\nPn \u223c P1\nP1\nn=1\n\nn=1\n\nConclusion.-In summary, we have analyzed the heralded quantum memory for single-photon polarization\nstate with a single atom trapped in an optical cavity [37],\nand demonstrated its applications in quantum communication network [1]. In our scheme, storage and retrieval of\nphoton polarization states have a high probability and fidelity. Heralded storage, entanglement distribution, and\nquantum communication are achieved by detecting the\nreflected photon. Thus in a realistic application operation errors due to all sources of photon loss, including\natomic spontaneous emission, cavity mirror absorption\nand scattering, and photon collection, are always signaled\nby the absence of a photon count. As a result, the photon loss only decreases the success probability but has no\ncontribution to the gate infidelity if the operation succeeds (i.e., if a photon count is registered). The ability\nto detect whether the operation has succeeded or not, is\ncrucial for practical application.\nAcknowledgments: This work was funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No.\n10574022 and Grant No. 60878059), the Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province of China (Grant No.\n2007J0002), the Foundation for Universities in Fujian\nProvince (Grant No. 2007F5041), and \"Hundreds of Talents \" program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.\n\nH.
