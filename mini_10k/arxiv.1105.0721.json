From laboratory\ntests, through solar system experiments and indirect gravitational wave measurements, to\nthe broad understanding of the expansion of the universe, the theory has performed breathtakingly well. Nevertheless, in recent years, a number of researchers have revisited the\nquestion of whether gravity might hold surprises for us, not in the high curvature regime, in\nwhich the effective field theory approach tells us GR should break down, but in the opposite,\nlong-distance limit. A primary influence behind this interest is the observed acceleration\nof the universe. This effect may, of course, be due to an unnaturally small cosmological\nconstant, or a new contribution to the mass-energy of the universe (dark energy). However,\na provocative possibility is that GR itself may not provide the correct set of rules with\nwhich to understand how the known matter and radiation content affects the universe on\nthe largest scales. It may be that curvatures and length scales in the observable universe\nare only now reaching values at which an infrared modification of gravity can make itself\napparent by driving self-acceleration (for reviews see [1\u20135]).\nWhen I began working on this idea, as an Assistant Professor at Syracuse University, I was\nquite surprised that one of the people responsible for our deep understanding of GR - Josh\nGoldberg - was so supportive of trying to tinker with this theory. In fact, Josh seemed to be\npositively excited at the possibility that there might be a crack in his favorite theory, and\nfrequently discussed some of the ideas we were working on with me.\nIn this article I will review some of the ways in which researchers have approached the\nquestion of modifying gravity to address cosmic acceleration. I will describe the difficulties\nin doing this in a sensible way, and focus on those ideas that I have worked on, beginning\nwith those that I have discussed with Josh, and moving on briefly to some more recent\nprogress stemming from extra dimensional approaches. Thus, I will begin by discussing\nf (R) models, and then briefly discuss their generalizations. I will then turn to induced\ngravity models, beginning with the DGP model, and then describing some generalizations\nand the fascinating four-dimensional effective field theories to which they reduce. Since this\narticle is intended to mostly discuss my own work, in which Josh has shown an interest, and\nbecause of space constraints, my referencing will be necessarily idiosyncratic, and reflect\n2\n\n\fpapers that have influenced my thinking, plus some reviews.\n\nII.\n\nMODIFYING GRAVITY\n\nThe metric tensor, the basic element of General Relativity, contains, in principle, more\ndegrees of freedom than the usual spin-2 graviton. The reason why one doesn't hear of\nthese degrees of freedom in GR is that the Einstein-Hilbert action is a very special choice,\nresulting in second-order equations of motion, which constrain away the scalars and the\nvectors, so that they are non-propagating. However, this is not the case if one departs from\nthe Einstein-Hilbert form for the action. When using any modified action (and the usual\nvariational principle) one inevitably frees up some of the additional degrees of freedom. In\nfact, this can be a good thing, in that the dynamics of these new degrees of freedom may be\nprecisely what one needs to drive the accelerated expansion of the universe. However, there\nis often a price to pay.\nThe problems may be of several different kinds. First, there is the possibility that along\nwith the desired deviations from GR on cosmological scales, one may also find similar deviations on solar system scales, at which GR is rather well-tested. Second is the possibility\nthat the newly-activated degrees of freedom may be badly behaved in one way or another;\neither having the wrong sign kinetic terms (ghosts), and hence being unstable, or leading to\nsuperluminal propagation, which may lead to other problems.\nThese constraints are surprisingly restrictive when one tries to create viable modified gravity\nmodels yielding cosmic acceleration.\n\nA.\n\nA Simple Model: f (R) Gravity\n\nThe simplest modification one could think of is to replace the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian\ndensity by a general function f (R) of the Ricci scalar R [6, 7].\nZ\n2 Z\n\u221a\nMPl\n4 \u221a\nd x \u2212g [R + f (R)] + d4 x \u2212g Lm [\u03c7i , g\u03bc\u03bd ] ,\nS=\n2\n\n3\n\n(1)\n\n\fwhere MPl \u2261 (8\u03c0G)\u22121/2 is the (reduced) Planck mass and Lm is the Lagrangian density for\nthe matter fields \u03c7i .\nHere, the matter Lagrangian is written as Lm [\u03c7i , g\u03bc\u03bd ] to make explicit that in this frame the Jordan frame - matter falls along geodesics of the metric g\u03bc\u03bd .\nThe equation of motion obtained by varying the action (1) is\n\u0001\nT\u03bc\u03bd\n1\n(1 + fR ) R\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 g\u03bc\u03bd (R + f ) + g\u03bc\u03bd \u22072 \u2212 \u2207\u03bc \u2207\u03bd fR = 2 ,\n2\nMPl\n\n(2)\n\nwhere fR \u2261 \u2202f /\u2202R.\nDescribing the matter content as a perfect fluid, with energy-momentum tensor,\nm\nT\u03bc\u03bd\n= (\u03c1m + pm )U\u03bc U\u03bd + pm g\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere U \u03bc is the fluid rest-frame four-velocity, \u03c1m is the energy density and pm is the pressure,\nthe fluid equation of motion is then the usual continuity equation.\nWhen considering the background cosmological evolution of such models, the metric can be\ntaken as the flat Robertson-Walker form, ds2 = \u2212dt2 + a2 (t)dx2 . In this case, the usual\nFriedmann equation of GR is modified to become\n\u03c1m\n1\n3H 2 \u2212 3fR (\u1e22 + H 2 ) + f + 18fRR H(\u1e26 + 4H \u1e22) = 2\n2\nMPl\n\n(4)\n\nand the continuity equation is\n\u03c1\u0307m + 3H(\u03c1m + pm ) = 0 .\n\n(5)\n\nWhen supplied with an equation of state parameter w, the above equations are sufficient to\nsolve for the background cosmological behavior of the space-time and it's matter contents.\nFor appropriate choices of the function f (R) it is possible to obtain late-time cosmic acceleration without the need for dark energy, although evading bounds from precision solar-system\ntests of gravity turns out to be a much trickier matter, as we shall see.\nIt is convenient to perform a carefully-chosen conformal transformation on the metric, in order to render the gravitational action in the usual Einstein Hilbert form of GR. We therefore\nwrite\ng\u0303\u03bc\u03bd = \u03a9(x\u03b1 )g\u03bc\u03bd ,\n4\n\n(6)\n\n\fand construct the function r(\u03a9) that satisfies\n1 + fR [r(\u03a9)] = \u03a9 .\n\n(7)\n\np\nDefining a rescaled scalar field by \u03a9 \u2261 e\u03b2\u03c6 , with \u03b2MPl \u2261 2/3, the resulting action becomes\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ\nZ\np\np\n1 \u03bc\u03bd\nMPl\n4\n4\nd x \u2212g\u0303 \u2212 g\u0303 (\u2202\u03bc \u03c6)\u2202\u03bd \u03c6 \u2212 V (\u03c6)\nS\u0303 =\nd x \u2212g\u0303 R\u0303 +\n2\n2\nZ\np\n(8)\n+\nd4 x \u2212g\u0303 e\u22122\u03b2\u03c6 Lm [\u03c7i , e\u2212\u03b2\u03c6 g\u0303\u03bc\u03bd ] ,\nwhere the potential V (\u03c6) is determined entirely by the original form (1) of the action and\nis given by\ne\u22122\u03b2\u03c6 \b \u03b2\u03c6\ne r[\u03a9(\u03c6)] \u2212 f (r[\u03a9(\u03c6)])\n2\n\nV (\u03c6) =\n\n.\n\n(9)\n\nThe equations of motion in the Einstein frame are much more familiar than those in the\nJordan frame, although there are some crucial subtleties. In particular, note that in general,\ntest particles of the matter content \u03c7i do not freely fall along geodesics of the metric g\u0303\u03bc\u03bd .\nThe equations of motion in this frame are those obtained by varying the action with respect\nto the metric g\u0303\u03bc\u03bd\nG\u0303\u03bc\u03bd =\n\n\u0011\n1 \u0010\n(\u03c6)\nT\u0303\n+\nT\n,\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bc\u03bd\n2\nMPl\n\n(10)\n\nwith respect to the scalar field \u03c6\n \u0303 2 \u03c6 = \u2212 dV (\u03c6) ,\n\u2207\nd\u03c6\n\n(11)\n\nand with respect to the matter fields \u03c7i , described as a perfect fluid.\nOnce again, we specialize to consider background cosmological evolution in this frame. The\nEinstein-frame line element can be written in familiar FRW form as\nds2 = \u2212dt\u03032 + \u00e32 (t\u0303)dx2 ,\nwhere dt\u0303 \u2261\n\n\u221a\n\n\u03a9 dt and \u00e3(t) \u2261\n\n\u221a\n\n(12)\n\n\u03a9 a(t). The Einstein-frame matter energy-momentum tensor\n\nis then given by\nm\nT\u0303\u03bc\u03bd\n= (\u03c1\u0303m + p\u0303m )\u0168\u03bc \u0168\u03bd + p\u0303m g\u0303\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\nwhere \u0168\u03bc \u2261\n\n\u221a\n\n\u03a9 U\u03bc , \u03c1\u0303m \u2261 \u03c1m /\u03a92 and p\u0303m \u2261 pm /\u03a92 .\n5\n\n(13)\n\n\fNow, as I mentioned in the introduction, any modification of the Einstein-Hilbert action\nmust, of course, be consistent with the classic solar system tests of gravity theory, as well\nas numerous other astrophysical dynamical tests. We have chosen the coupling constant \u03bc\nto be very small, but we have also introduced a new light degree of freedom. As shown by\nChiba [8], the simple model above is equivalent to a Brans-Dicke theory with \u03c9 = 0 in the\napproximation where the potential was neglected, and would therefore be inconsistent with\nsolar system measurements [9].\nTo construct a realistic f (R) model requires a more complicated function, with more than\none adjustable parameter in order to fit the cosmological data [10] and satisfy solar system\nbounds through the chameleon [11] mechanism.\n\nB.\n\nExtensions: Higher-Order Curvature Invariants\n\nIt is natural to consider generalizing the action of [6] to include other curvature invariants [12]. There are, of course, any number of terms that one could consider, but for simplicity, focus on those invariants of lowest mass dimension that are also parity-conserving\nP \u2261 R\u03bc\u03bd R\u03bc\u03bd and Q \u2261 R\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 R\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 .\nThe action then takes the form\nZ\nZ\n\u221a\n4 \u221a\nS = d x \u2212g [R + f (R, P, Q)] + d4 x \u2212g LM ,\n\n(14)\n\nwhere f (R, P, Q) is a general function describing deviations from general relativity.\nActions of the form (14) generically admit a maximally-symmetric solution that is often\nunstable to another accelerating power-law attractor. It has been shown that solar system\nconstraints, of the type I have described for f (R) models, can be evaded by these more\ngeneral models when, for example, the Q terms are relevant on those scales. However,\nthese theories generically contain ghosts and/or superluminally propagating modes [13\u201315].\nI therefore will not discuss them further here.\n\n6\n\n\fC.\n\nInduced Gravity Models\n\nIn the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) model [16], our observed 4D universe is embedded\nin an infinite empty fifth dimension. Despite the fact that the extra dimension is infinite in\nextent, the inverse-square law is nevertheless recovered at short distances on the brane due\nto an intrinsic, four-dimensional Einstein-Hilbert term in the action\n\u0013\n\u0012 2\nZ\nZ\nM53\nM4\n5 \u221a\n4 \u221a\nSDGP =\nd x \u2212g5\nR5 +\nd x \u2212g4\nR4 + Lmatter .\n2\n2\nbulk\nbrane\n\n(15)\n\nThe Newtonian potential on the brane scales as 1/r at short distances, as in 4D gravity,\nand asymptotes to 1/r 2 at large distances, characteristic of 5D gravity. The cross-over scale\nm\u22121\n5 between these two behaviors is set by the bulk and brane Planck masses (M5 and M4\nrespectively) via m5 =\n\nM53\n.\nM42\n\nIn this picture, the higher-dimensional nature of gravity affects the 4D brane through deviations from general relativity on horizon scales, that may give rise to the observed accelerated\nexpansion. This model faces its own challenges however. The branch of solutions that include self-acceleration suffers from ghost-like instabilities, and on the observational front,\nDGP cosmology is statistically disfavored in comparison to \u039bCDM and is significantly discordant with constraints on the curvature of the universe.\n\nIII.\n\nGALILEONS\n\nCareful studies of the DGP model have, however, given rise to new ideas about how to\nconstruct four-dimensional effective field theories with symmetries that may be relevant for\ncosmology. The decoupling limit of DGP consists of a 4-dimensional effective theory of\ngravity coupled to a single scalar field \u03c0, representing the bending mode of the brane in\nthe fifth dimension. The \u03c0 field self-interaction includes a cubic self-interaction \u223c (\u2202\u03c0)2 \u0003\u03c0,\nwhich has the properties that the field equations are second order, and the terms are invariant\nup to a total derivative under the internal galilean transformations\n\u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0 + c + b\u03bc x\u03bc ,\nwhere c, b\u03bc are arbitrary real constants.\n7\n\n(16)\n\n\fIn [17], this was generalized, and all possible lagrangian terms for a single scalar with these\ntwo properties were classified in all dimensions. They are called galileon terms, and there\nexists a single galileon lagrangian at each order in \u03c0, where \"order\" refers to the number of\ncopies of \u03c0 that appear in the term. For n \u2265 1, the (n + 1)-th order galileon lagrangian is\nLn+1 = n\u03b7 \u03bc1 \u03bd1 \u03bc2 \u03bd2 ***\u03bcn \u03bdn (\u2202\u03bc1 \u03c0\u2202\u03bd1 \u03c0\u2202\u03bc2 \u2202\u03bd2 \u03c0 * * * \u2202\u03bcn \u2202\u03bdn \u03c0) ,\n\n(17)\n\nwhere\n\u03b7 \u03bc1 \u03bd1 \u03bc2 \u03bd2 ***\u03bcn \u03bdn \u2261\n\n1 X\n(\u22121)p \u03b7 \u03bc1 p(\u03bd1 ) \u03b7 \u03bc2 p(\u03bd2 ) * * * \u03b7 \u03bcn p(\u03bdn ) .\nn! p\n\n(18)\n\nThe sum in (18) is over all permutations of the \u03bd indices, with (\u22121)p the sign of the permutation. The tensor (18) is anti-symmetric in the \u03bc indices, anti-symmetric the \u03bd indices, and\nsymmetric under interchange of any \u03bc, \u03bd pair with any other. These lagrangians are unique\nup to total derivatives and overall constants. Because of the anti-symmetry requirement on\n\u03b7, only the first n of these galileons are non-trivial in n-dimensions. In addition, the tadpole\nterm, \u03c0, is galilean invariant, and we therefore include it as the first-order galileon.\nThus, at the first few orders, we have\nL1 = \u03c0,\n\n(19)\n\nL2 = [\u03c0 2 ],\nL3 = [\u03c0 2 ][\u03a0] \u2212 [\u03c0 3 ],\n1\n1\nL4 = [\u03c0 2 ][\u03a0]2 \u2212 [\u03c0 3 ][\u03a0] + [\u03c0 4 ] \u2212 [\u03c0 2 ][\u03a02 ],\n2\n2\n1 3\n1\n1\n1\n1 2\n3\n2\n4\nL5 = [\u03c0 ][\u03a0] \u2212 [\u03c0 ][\u03a0] + [\u03c0 ][\u03a0] \u2212 [\u03c0 5 ] + [\u03c0 2 ][\u03a03 ] \u2212 [\u03c0 2 ][\u03a0][\u03a02 ] + [\u03c0 3 ][\u03a02 ] .\n6\n2\n3\n2\n2\nWe have used the notation \u03a0 for the matrix of partials \u03a0\u03bc\u03bd \u2261 \u2202\u03bc \u2202\u03bd \u03c0, and [\u03a0n ] \u2261 T r(\u03a0n ),\n\ne.g. [\u03a0] = \u0003\u03c0, [\u03a02 ] = \u2202\u03bc \u2202\u03bd \u03c0\u2202 \u03bc \u2202 \u03bd \u03c0, and [\u03c0 n ] \u2261 \u2202\u03c0 * \u03a0n\u22122 * \u2202\u03c0, i.e. [\u03c0 2 ] = \u2202\u03bc \u03c0\u2202 \u03bc \u03c0,\n\n[\u03c0 3 ] = \u2202\u03bc \u03c0\u2202 \u03bc \u2202 \u03bd \u03c0\u2202\u03bd \u03c0.

However,\ncrucially, the Ln terms above do not get renormalized upon loop corrections, so that their\nclassical values can be trusted quantum-mechanically\nIn principle, one should consider quantum effects within the effective theory, since there are\nother operators of the same dimension that might compete with the galileon terms. However,\nfascinatingly, there can exist interesting regimes where non-linearities from the galileon terms\nare important, yet quantum effects are under control. This separation of scales allows for the\nexistence of regimes in which there exist classical field configurations with non-linearities of\norder one, and still trust these solutions in light of quantum corrections. These non-linear,\nquantum-controlled regimes are where interesting models of inflation, cosmology, modified\ngravity, etc. employing these galileon actions should be placed.\n9\n\n\fA.\n\nGalileons on Curved Spaces\n\nWhile various authors have considered the uses of these theories for early and late cosmology,\nit would be interesting to find examples of theories with the same attractive symmetry\nfeatures, but which naturally live on the curved manifolds relevant to cosmology. There\nare obstacles to performing this in a straightforward manner [23]. However, in very recent\npapers [24, 25] we have demonstrated how to construct such models1 , and I will finish up\nthis article by briefly describing the construction.\nThe general context is the theory of a dynamical 3-brane moving in a fixed (4+1)-dimensional\nbackground. The dynamical variables are the brane embedding X A (x), five functions of the\nworld-volume coordinates x\u03bc . The bulk has a fixed background metric GAB (X), from which\nwe may construct the induced metric \u1e21\u03bc\u03bd (x) and the extrinsic curvature K\u03bc\u03bd (x)\n\u1e21\u03bc\u03bd = eA\u03bc eB\u03bd GAB (X) ,\nK\u03bc\u03bd = eA\u03bc eB\u03bd \u2207A nB ,\nwhere eA\u03bc =\n\n\u2202X A\n\u2202x\u03bc\n\n(27)\n(28)\n\nare the tangent vectors to the brane, and nA is the unit normalized normal\n\nvector.\nThe world-volume action must be gauge invariant under reparametrizations of the brane,\nwhich is guaranteed if the action is written as a diffeomorphism scalar, F , of \u1e21\u03bc\u03bd , K\u03bc\u03bd , the\n \u0304 \u03bc and the curvature R\u0304\u03b1 constructed from \u1e21\u03bc\u03bd ,\ncovariant derivative \u2207\n\u03b2\u03bc\u03bd\nZ\n\u0001\n\u221a\n \u0304 \u03bc , R\u0304\u03b1 , K\u03bc\u03bd .\n(29)\nS = d4 x \u2212\u1e21F \u1e21\u03bc\u03bd , \u2207\n\u03b2\u03bc\u03bd\nThis action possesses global symmetries only if the bulk metric possesses Killing symmetries.\nWe fix all the gauge symmetry by choosing the gauge\nX \u03bc (x) = x\u03bc ,\n\nX 5 (x) \u2261 \u03c0(x) ,\n\n(30)\n\nwhere we have foliated the bulk by time-like slices given by the surfaces X 5 (x) = constant.\nThe remaining coordinates X \u03bc can then be chosen arbitrarily and parametrize the leaves\n1\n\nThis construction has connections to some other recently proposed ones [26, 27]\n\n10\n\n\fof the foliation. In this gauge, the coordinate \u03c0(x) measures the transverse position of the\nbrane relative to the foliation, and the resulting action solely describes \u03c0,\nZ\n\u0001\n\u221a\n \u0304 \u03bc , R\u0304\u03b1\u03b2\u03bc\u03bd , K\u03bc\u03bd\nS = d4 x \u2212\u1e21F \u1e21\u03bc\u03bd , \u2207\n.\nX \u03bc =x\u03bc , X 5 =\u03c0\n\n(31)\n\nSince gauge fixing cannot alter global symmetries, any global symmetries of (29) become\nglobal symmetries of (31). However, the form of the global symmetries depends on the\ngauge because the gauge choice is not generally preserved by the global symmetry. Given\na transformation generated by a Killing vector, K A , we restore our preferred gauge (30) by\nmaking a compensating gauge transformation \u03b4g,comp x\u03bc = \u2212K \u03bc . The two symmetries then\ncombine to shift \u03c0 by\n(\u03b4K + \u03b4g,comp )\u03c0 = \u2212K \u03bc (x, \u03c0)\u2202\u03bc \u03c0 + K 5 (x, \u03c0) ,\n\n(32)\n\nwhich is a symmetry of the gauge fixed action (31).\nIt is convenient at this stage to make two simplifying assumptions. We specialize to the case\nin which the foliation is Gaussian normal with respect to the metric GAB , and we demand\nthat the extrinsic curvature on each of the slices be proportional to the induced metric.\nUnder these assumptions the metric takes the form\nGAB dX A dX B = d\u03c12 + f (\u03c1)2 g\u03bc\u03bd (x)dx\u03bc dx\u03bd ,\n\n(33)\n\nwhere X 5 = \u03c1 denotes the transverse coordinate, and g\u03bc\u03bd (x) is an arbitrary brane metric.\nThis special case includes all examples in which a maximally symmetric ambient space is\nfoliated by maximally symmetric slices.\nIn the gauge (30), the induced metric is \u1e21\u03bc\u03bd = f (\u03c0)2 g\u03bc\u03bd + \u2207\u03bc \u03c0\u2207\u03bd \u03c0. Defining the quantity\nq\n\u03b3 = 1/ 1 + f12 (\u2207\u03c0)2 , the extrinsic curvature is then\nK\u03bc\u03bd\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\nf\u2032\n\u2032\n= \u03b3 \u2212\u2207\u03bc \u2207\u03bd \u03c0 + f f g\u03bc\u03bd + 2 \u2207\u03bc \u03c0\u2207\u03bd \u03c0 .\nf\n\n(34)\n\nA general choice for the action (31) will lead to scalar field equations for \u03c0 which are\nhigher than second order in derivatives and may therefore propagate extra ghost degrees of\nfreedom. However, as pointed out in [28], there are a finite number of actions that lead to\nsecond order equations. The possible extensions of Einstein gravity which remain second\n11\n\n\forder are given by Lovelock terms and their boundary terms. These terms are specific\ncombinations of powers of the Riemann tensor which are topological (i.e. total derivatives)\nin some specific home dimension, but in lower dimensions have the property that equations\nof motions derived from them are second order.\nThe prescription of [28] is then as follows: on the 4-dimensional brane, we may add the first\n\u221a\ntwo Lovelock terms, namely the cosmological constant term \u223c \u2212\u1e21 and the Einstein-Hilbert\n\u221a\nterm \u223c \u2212\u1e21R[\u1e21]. (The higher Lovelock terms will be total derivatives in 4-dimensions.)\n\u221a\nWe may also add the boundary term corresponding to a bulk Einstein-Hilbert term, \u2212\u1e21K,\n\nand the boundary term LGB corresponding to the Gauss-Bonnet Lovelock invariant R2 \u2212\n4R\u03bc\u03bd R\u03bc\u03bd + R\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 R\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 in the bulk. The zero order cosmological constant Lovelock term in\n\nthe bulk has no boundary term, although we may construct a tadpole-like term from it, and\nthe higher order bulk Lovelock terms vanish identically. Therefore, in total, for a 3-brane\nthere are five terms that lead to second order equations for \u03c0,\nZ \u03c0\n\u221a\nL1 = \u2212g\nd\u03c0 \u2032 f (\u03c0 \u2032 )4 ,\n\u221a\nL2 = \u2212 \u2212\u1e21 ,\n\u221a\nL3 = \u2212\u1e21K ,\n\u221a\nL4 = \u2212 \u2212\u1e21 R\u0304 ,\n3\u221a\n\u2212\u1e21KGB ,\nL5 =\n2\n\n(35)\n\n2\nwhere the explicit form of the Gauss-Bonnet boundary term is KGB = \u2212 13 K 3 + K\u03bc\u03bd\nK\u2212\n\u0001\n2\nK 3 \u2212 2 R\u0304\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 21 R\u0304\u1e21\u03bc\u03bd K \u03bc\u03bd .\n3 \u03bc\u03bd\n\nL1 is the zero derivative tadpole term which is the proper volume between any \u03c1 = constant\nsurface and the brane position, \u03c0(x). While different in origin from the other terms, it too\nhas the symmetry (32). Each of these terms may appear in a general Lagrangian with an\narbitrary coefficient.\nEvaluating these expressions for the metric (33) involves a lengthy calculation which ulti-\n\n12\n\n\fmately yields\n\u221a\n\nZ\n\n\u03c0\n\nd\u03c0 \u2032 f (\u03c0 \u2032 )4 ,\nr\n\u221a\n1\n4\nL2 = \u2212 \u2212gf 1 + 2 (\u2202\u03c0)2 ,\nf\n\u0003\n\u221a \u0002 3 \u2032\nL3 = \u2212g f f (5 \u2212 \u03b3 2 ) \u2212 f 2 [\u03a0] + \u03b3 2 [\u03c0 3 ] ,\n\u221a n1\nL4 = \u2212 \u2212g f 2 R \u2212 2\u03b3R\u03bc\u03bd \u2207\u03bc \u03c0\u2207\u03bd \u03c0\n\u03b3\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0001\n\u03b32\n2\n2\n3\n4\n+\u03b3 [\u03a0] \u2212 [\u03a0 ] + 2 2 \u2212[\u03a0][\u03c0 ] + [\u03c0 ]\nf\n\u0001\nf 3f \u2032\u2032\n\u22121 + \u03b3 2\n+6\n\u03b3\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0001\n\u03b32 2\n\u2032\n3\n+2\u03b3f f \u22124[\u03a0] + 2 f [\u03a0] + 4[\u03c0 ]\nf\n2 \u20322\n\u0001o\nf f\n1 \u2212 2\u03b3 2 + \u03b3 4 .\n\u22126\n\u03b3\nL1 =\n\n\u2212g\n\n(36)\n\nThe expression for L5 is lengthy, and can be found in [24].\nIn these expressions, all curvatures and covariant derivatives are those of the background\nmetric g\u03bc\u03bd . The notation is as earlier, but with covariant derivatives replacing partial ones.\nNote that no integrations by parts have been performed in obtaining these terms. The\nequations of motion contain no more than two derivatives on each field, ensuring that no\nextra degrees of freedom propagate around any background.\nTo develop the analogues of the original Galileon theory, we expand the Lagrangians in\npowers of \u03bb around some constant background, \u03c0 \u2192 \u03c00 + \u03bb\u03c0. One can find appropriate\n\nlinear combinations of the Lagrangians, L\u0304n = c1 L1 + . . . + cn Ln , for which all terms O (\u03bbn\u22121 )\n\nor lower are total derivatives. This was performed in [28] for the M4 in M5 case and the\nresults precisely reproduce the Galileon and conformal Galileon theories, respectively. These\nexamples are two of the six cases where both the bulk and the leaves of the foliation are\nmaximally symmetric, and the bulk metric has a single time component.\nWhen this prescription is carried out for the remaining four maximally symmetric cases in\nwhich the 4d background is curved, new classes of theories are produced.

These simpler Lagrangians are Galileons that live on curved space yet retain the same number of symmetries\nas the full theory, whose form comes from expanding (32) in appropriate powers of \u03bb.

In particular, the scalar field acquires a mass of order the dS4 or AdS4 radius,\nwith a value protected by the symmetries (38), so the small masses should be protected\nagainst renormalization.\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nAmong the possible explanations for the observed accelerated expansion of the universe, the\npossibility that general relativity may become modified on the largest scales is a particularly intriguing one. In this talk I have outlined a number of modern approaches to this\nproblem, focusing, as expected, on those that I have been involved with in one way or another. I have described how the combined constraints of theoretical consistency, solar system\nmeasurements, and cosmological observations tightly bound the possible viable models.\n14\n\n\fFrom higher dimensional constructions, such as the DGP model, an interesting set of four\ndimensional effective field theories - the galileons - arises, encapsulating the effects of modifying gravity. I have described how we have generalized that work to multi-galileon theories,\nand to covariant galileons propagating on curved backgrounds. This very recent work opens\nup the possibility of galileons with potentials protected by the symmetries inherited from\nthe higher-dimensional bulk, and therefore naturally suited to inflation or describing late\ntime cosmic acceleration.\nMy interest in the general area of modifying gravity as a possible explanation for cosmic\nacceleration began quite a few years ago. I was fortunate to be encouraged by Josh Goldberg\nfrom the very beginning, and to spend eight years as his colleague. It is a pleasure to be\nable to devote this article to his career.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nI would like to thank Ed Glass and David Robinson for inviting me to contribute to this\nvolume.
