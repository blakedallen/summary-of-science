A 1.8\u00d71.4 kpc\nconcentration of CO (3\u20132) emitting gas with a total mass of 4 \u00d7 109 M\u2299 coincides\nwith the peaks of NIR, MIR, and radio continuum emission found previously by\nothers, identifying the dense fuel for the AGN and/or the starburst activity there.\nExtensive CO (2\u20131) emission is also detected, revealing detailed distribution and\nkinematics that are consistent with the earlier CO (1\u20130) results. The widely\ndistributed molecular gas traced in CO (2\u20131) and the distributed discrete peaks\nof CO (3\u20132) emission suggest that a spatially extended intense starbursts may\ncontribute significantly to its large IR luminosity.

Tidal interaction\n1\n\nHarvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, 60 Garden Street, Cambridge, MA 02138\n\n2\n\nDepartment of Astronomy, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01002\n\n3\n\nAcademia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, P.O. Box 23-141, Taipei 106, Taiwan, R.O.C.\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nbetween two or more gas-rich progenitor galaxies is largely responsible for radially transporting the gas to the central kpc, condensing the gas and triggering subsequent starburst\nactivity there (Mihos & Hernquist 1996). It is now widely accepted that the elevated level of\ninfrared luminosity originates from the reprocessed emission from the dust particles surrounding the starburst or AGN. Based on a number of similarities, the infrared bright galaxies\nare thought to be the local analogs of the high redshift sub-mm sources discovered using\nSCUBA on JCMT during the last decade (Blain et al. 2002), and understanding the nearby\nLIRGs/ULIRGs population is an important step toward better understanding the sub-mm\ngalaxy phenomenon.\nInvestigation of LIRGs/ULIRGs using molecular gas at the low J-transitions (CO (1\u20130)\nat 2.6 mm and CO (2\u20131) at 1.3 mm) were carried out extensively in the past (Bryant &\nScoville 1999; Downes & Solomon 1998). While these CO transitions were believed to be\na good tracer of the optically thick dense gas identifying the extent of the starburst region\nand the distribution of the fuel for such activity, more recent studies suggest that the diffuse\ninter-clump medium may dominate the CO luminosity in these low J-transition CO emission\n(Downes & Solomon 1998). Since these two J-transitions require only a small difference in\nexcitation conditions, the large scale distribution of the molecular gas inferred is usually\nquite similar (Downes & Solomon 1998). The J = 3 \u2192 2 transition of CO has a higher\nexcitation temperature (33 K) and critical density (\u223c 104 cm\u22123 ), making it a better tracer\nof the warmer and denser molecular gas of the starburst regions. In this letter, we present\nhigh resolution CO (3\u20132) and CO (2\u20131) interferometric maps of the IR-bright galaxy system\nVV 114 observed with the Submillimeter Array (SMA)1 (Ho, Moran & Lo 2004) to trace the\ndistribution of the warmer dense gas and its relation to the colder, more diffuse molecular\ngas.\nVV 114 is a gas rich (MH2 = 5.1 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 ; Yun, Scoville & Knop 1994, YSK94\nhereafter) nearby (D = 77 Mpc) interacting system with high infrared luminosity (LIR =\n4.0 \u00d7 1011 L\u2299 ; Soifer et al. 1987). The projected nuclear separation between the two optical\ngalaxies (VV 114E and VV 114W) is \u223c 6 kpc. Frayer et al. (1999) found a large amount of\ndust (Mdust = 1.2 \u00d7 108 M\u2299 ) distributed across the galaxy with dust temperature of 20 \u2212 25\nK. About half of the warmer dust traced in the MIR is associated with VV 114E, where both\ncompact (nuclear region) and extended emission are found (Le Floc'h et al. 2002). The MIR\nspectrum also shows a sign of an AGN in VV 114E (Le Floc'h et al. 2002). Alonso-Herrero,\nRieke & Rieke (2002) detected abundant H II regions in VV 114E and in the overlap region\n1\n\nThe Submillimeter Array is a joint project between the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and the\nAcademia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, and is funded by the Smithsonian Institution and\nthe Academia Sinica\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nusing the narrow-band Pa\u03b1 images. Scoville et al. (2000) imaged the near infrared emission\nusing NICMOS on-board HST and found that the highly optically obscured VV 114E (Knop\net al. 1994) is the brighter of the two in the near infrared. Far-UV imaging using STIS\nfound several hundred young star clusters in VV 114W, while no UV emission was found\nin VV 114E (Goldader et al. 2002) which suggests that most of the activity in VV 114E is\nobscured by dust and not visible in the UV emission.\n\n2.\n\nObservations & Results\n\nVV 114 was observed under good weather conditions (\u03c4230 \u223c 0.08) in CO (3\u20132) and\nCO (2\u20131) using six 6-meter diameter elements of the SMA on September 30, 2003 and on\nSeptember 12, 2003, respectively. The receivers were tuned to 339.0 GHz (LSB) and 226.0\nGHz (LSB) which resulted in a primary beam size of 35\u2032\u2032 and 52\u2032\u2032 (FWHM) for CO (3\u20132)\nand CO (2\u20131). The array was in the \"compact\" configuration which includes the shortest\nand longest projected baseline of 10 and 65 meters, respectively. The largest detectable\nstructure are thus 18\u2032\u2032 and 27\u2032\u2032 in the CO (3\u20132) and CO (2\u20131) lines, and the missing short\nspacing information may have substantially impacted the continuum and CO (3\u20132) maps\n(see below). These observations were made during the testing and commissioning phase\nof the construction of the array, and extra calibration steps were taken to scrutinize the\narray performance. Two nearby quasars, 0132\u2212169 and 0050\u2212094, were observed every\n25 minutes to track the instrumental gain, and absolute flux calibration was performed by\nobserving Uranus. The telescope pointing drifted significantly (10-20\u2032\u2032) during the track,\nand the resulting amplitude error primarily limits the overall dynamic range of the images\nto . 20. Initial data calibration was carried out using the Caltech millimeter array software\npackage MIR which is modified for SMA. The calibrated data were imaged using NRAO\nsoftware package AIPS (van Moorsel, Kemball & Greisen 1996). The spectrometer was\nconfigured with a total bandwidth of 960 MHz with a 0.8 MHz channel spacing. The final\nspectral channel maps were made by smoothing the data to a velocity resolution of about\n22 km/s. Finally, the astrometry was examined by calibrating 0050\u2212094 (secondary) with\n0132\u2212169 (primary), and we estimate a positional uncertainty of \u223c 0.3\u2032\u2032 . A summary of\nthe observations is given in Table 1. Further technical descriptions of the SMA and its\ncalibration schemes are found in Ho, Moran & Lo (2004).\nContinuum images are constructed by averaging the entire 960 MHz bandwidth of the\nimage sideband data, and neither the 1.3 mm nor the 850\u03bcm continuum is detected with\n3\u03c3 upper limits of 15 mJy and 150 mJy, respectively (see Table 1). The JCMT/SCUBA\nsubmm continuum images by Frayer et al. (1999) suggest a source extent of \u223c 30\u2032\u2032 (11 kpc) in\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n\nTable 1.

From their dust model fit to the 450\u03bcm and 850\u03bcm measurements, we estimate a\ntotal 1.3 mm flux density of \u223c 100 mJy. Smoothing the SMA data to the angular resolution\nof the JCMT does not reveal any emission feature, and a significant fraction of the dust\nemission may arise from a smooth structure larger than our shortest baseline (\u03b8 & 27\u2032\u2032 ).\nAssuming the extent of the dust emission is similar to that of the CO (1\u20130) emission, we\nderive a 3\u03c3 upper limit in 1 mm continuum of 120 mJy.\n\n2.1.\n\nCO(3\u20132) Emission\n\nOur new SMA CO (3\u20132) image, shown in Figure 1a, reveals a 5.0 \u00d7 2.0 kpc bar-like\nmorphology with two peaks (C1 and C3) occupying the two ends and a third peak C2\nlocated near the center of the bar. A similar structure is seen in both lower J transitions (see\nFig. 1 and compare the higher contours of CO (2\u20131) with the lower contours of CO (3\u20132)).\nMore than 50% of the total CO (3\u20132) flux is detected in the compact molecular concentration\nlabeled C1 in the IR-bright dusty eastern galaxy (VV114E), coincident with the NIR (Doyon\net al. 1995; Scoville et al. 2000), MIR (Le Floc'h et al. 2002) and radio continuum emission\n(Condon et al. 1990). Assuming optically thick emission and the standard galactic CO \u2212 H2\nconversion (Sanders, Scoville & Soifer 1991), its inferred molecular gas mass is 4 \u00d7 109M\u2299 ,\nand this accounts for nearly 40% of its virial mass (1010 M\u2299 for a deconvoled source size of\n1.4 \u00d7 1.8 kpc and \u2206v = 100 km/s), similar to what is commonly seen in the nuclear regions\nof other infrared luminous galaxies (Scoville, Yun, & Bryant 1997; Downes & Solomon\n1998). The peak C2 roughly coincides with the brightest peaks in CO (2\u20131) and CO (1\u20130),\nand the peak C3 extends to the part of the region of VV 114W where copious clusters of\nyoung stars have been observed previously (Alonso-Herrero, Rieke & Rieke 2002; Goldader\net al. 2002). Despite the strong CO (3\u20132) emission seen in VV 114E, the main disk of\nthe optically bright western galaxy (VV 114W) shows little emission, possibly resolved out\nby the interferometer. The nuclear region of VV 114E exhibits higher line intensity ratios\n(r21 = I21 /I10 and r31 = I32 /I10 ) than the rest of the system, suggesting the presence of\nsignificantly warmer, denser gas. The inference of high gas temperature is further supported\nby the observed peak brightness temperature of \u2206T \u223c 10 K averaged over the 1 kpc beam\narea (i.e., T \u223c 100 K for a filling factor f \u223c 0.1).\nThe absence of baselines shorter than 10 meters and the resulting limited sensitivity\nto structures & 18\u2032\u2032 in extent may account for much of the extended structure missing in\nthe CO (3\u20132) image. For spectral line observations, this spatial filtering is not as severe\nas one naively calculates since coherent bulk motions such as galactic rotation substantially\nreduces the effective angular sizes of the emitting regions in individual velocity channels.\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nMulti-isotopic, multi-transition analysis of molecular tracers have indicated a multi-phase\nmedium with a significant contribution by sub-thermally excited diffuse gas in the turbulent\nnuclear starburst regions and thus a lower conversion factor between the CO luminosity and\nthe total molecular gas mass (see Aalto et al. 1995; Downes & Solomon 1998). Therefore,\nsome of the observed morphological differences from the lower J transitions (which are more\neasily excited) may reflect real differences in the physical properties of gas. A more definitive\ncharacterization of the distribution and physical properties of the warm, dense gas traced in\nCO (3\u20132) will require obtaining a single dish measurement in the future. The total observed\nline flux of 2275 Jy km/s translates to a total molecular gas mass of 2 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 , which is\nabout 40% of the total gas mass inferred from the CO (1\u20130) measurement by (YSK94), and\nthis demonstrates clearly both the large gas mass and the highly concentrated nature of the\ndense (n \u2265 104 cm\u22123 ) molecular gas in VV 114.\nThe clumpy spatial distribution of the high density gas makes the CO (3\u20132) kinematics\nappear complex (see Figure 2). A rotation-like velocity gradient is seen from the southwestnortheast with a noticeably steeper gradient near the C2. The direction of the overall velocity\ngradient is consistent with that in CO (1\u20130) (YSK94) and in CO (2\u20131) (Fig. 1d). A large\namount of extended emission may be missing by our observations, and the derived velocity\nfield should be interpreted with a caution. Both the excitation requirement for the CO (3\u20132)\nemission and the spatial filtering by the interferometer may be isolating the kinematics of the\ndensest gas, possibly in the deepest parts of the evolving potential. The total linewidth at\nzero intensity is 330 km/s, much narrower than those traced in CO (1\u20130) and CO (2\u20131), and\nthe linewidth in VV 114E alone spans over 100 km/s. The peak C1 is most likely associated\nwith VV 114E, and we thus infer the systemic velocity of 6052 km/s for VV 114E.\n\n2.2.\n\nCO(2\u20131) Emission\n\nThe velocity integrated CO (2\u20131) map is shown in Figure 1b. The CO (2\u20131) emission\nextends widely across the two disks comprising VV 114, showing a high degree of similarity\nto the CO (1\u20130) (YSK94; also Fig. 1c), including both the bar-like structure 5 \u00d7 3 kpc in\nextent dominating the central region and a long (3 kpc) molecular tail extending out from the\nsoutheastern edge with no obvious optical counterpart. The higher angular resolution of the\nCO (2\u20131) map makes subtle features appear more enhanced, but the overall distribution is\nvery similar to the CO (1\u20130) map. The excellent correspondence of the two is not surprising\nsince both transitions are easily excited by the physical conditions typical of cold, dense\n(T = 10 \u2212 20 K, n \u223c 103 cm\u22123 ) gas. The global line intensity ratio r21 = I21 /I10 = 2.4 \u00b1 0.7\nis much smaller than the expected value of 4 for fully thermalized, optically thick emission\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nfrom a single phase gas. This is a further indication that sub-thermal excitation is an\nimportant concern for CO transitions in this object.\nThe gas kinematics traced in CO(2\u20131) and CO(1\u20130) lines are also nearly identical. The\ntotal linewidth of the CO (2\u20131) emission is 520 km/s which is comparable to the linewidth of\nthe CO (1\u20130) emission. By taking the median velocity of the emission channels, the CO (2\u20131)\nsystemic velocity of VV 114 as a whole is estimated at 6027 km/s. A steep velocity gradient\nis seen in both CO (2\u20131) and CO (1\u20130) where the southeastern molecular tail connects to\nthe main component of molecular gas in VV 114, but a smaller gradient is seen along the 3\nkpc length farther south. This may suggest that the molecular tail is tidally driven, and its\nkinematics are dominated by the angular momentum of the part of the galaxy from which\nit was initially perturbed (see below). The large velocity dispersion is seen near C2 in both\nCO (2\u20131) and CO (1\u20130) emission, possibly marking the new dynamical center of the merger\n(YSK94). Alternatively, the large velocity dispersion may imply a tidally induced radial\nmotion seen along the line of sight.\n\n3.\n\nDiscussion\n\nWhile several hundred young star clusters have been identified in VV 114W (Goldader\net al. 2002), most of the current vigorous activity is seen in the highly obscured galaxy,\nVV 114E, as identified by its infrared, radio and sub-mm continuum emission. The origin\nof the intense IR emission, starburst or AGN or both, in VV 114 is still subject to debate.\nWhile Le Floc'h et al. (2002) suggests that 40% of the MIR emission is associated with the\ncompact nuclear AGN in VV 114E, different diagnostics (i.e. NIR spectroscopy, Doyon\net al. 1995) suggest that the IR emission is mostly dominated by young stars. The three\nmassive, compact gas complexes identified by our CO (3\u20132) observations mark the locations\nof the densest concentrations of gas and the sites of current activities fueled by this gas. The\ndominant peak C1 in VV 114E appears to mark the location of the most intense current\nactivity. The distributed nature of CO (3\u20132) emission and the presence of several massive gas\nconcentrations provide the clearest evidence yet that distributed intense starburst activity\nmay provide a significant fraction of the large IR luminosity in VV 114.\nOur new CO (3\u20132) and CO (2\u20131) observations strengthen the earlier suggestion that\nVV 114 is a late stage merger ready to undergo more massive bursts of star formation in\nthe near future. The widely extended CO (2\u20131) and CO (1\u20130) emission across the two\ngalaxies implies that the cold and dense gas have begun to decouple from the gravitational\npotential of the host galaxies, and such decoupling only occurs in the well advanced stages\n(t \u223c 5 \u00d7 108 years since the initial collision) before the coalescence results in a massive\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nelliptical galaxy (e.g., Mihos & Hernquist 1996). The three discrete peaks traced in CO (3\u2013\n2) emission identify the massive and compact molecular gas concentrations condensing out\nof the inflowing gas. By comparing the observed distribution of gas and optical morphology\nto those predicted in simulations (Mihos & Hernquist 1996; Iono, Yun & Mihos 2004), we\nestimate that the final coalescence may occur within the next \u223c 108 years. The CO (1\u20130) and\nCO (2\u20131) gas distribution of VV 114 is very similar to what is seen in the IR-bright galaxy\nNGC 6090 (Bryant & Scoville 1999; Wang et al. 2004). There the widely extended gas is\nseen over the edge-on and face-on system separated by 3.4 kpc, where not only the CO (1\u20130)\nand CO (2\u20131) but also the CO (3\u20132) gas peaks in the overlap region (Wang et al. 2004).\nThus, both VV 114 and NGC 6090 appears to be undergoing a similar transition where the\nbulk of the gas is in the process of decoupling from the host galaxies and funneling toward\nthe dynamical center of the new combined potential, possibly resulting in the ultraluminous\n(LIR \u2265 1012 L\u2299 ) phase, following the scenario advocated by Yun, Scoville & Knop (1994).\nThe authors would like to thank J.
