We have also studied the effect of other pseudoscalar meson exchanges and sensitivity\nto the short-range cutoff radius, r0 , for the meson exchanges.\n\n1\n\n\fI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nQuantum ChromoDynamics (QCD) is believed to be the fundamental theory of the strong\ninteraction. However it is difficult to use to calculate the low energy properties of complicated\nquark-gluon systems directly, such as the NN interaction and the structure of multi-quarkgluon systems. Various quark models afford a framework to understand the physics in these\ncases.\nIn the last 30 years, various QCD inspired models have been developed with both successes\nand failures in explaining low energy hadron physics. To mention a few but certainly not\nall, there are the MIT bag model[1], cloudy bag model[2], Friedberg-Lee nontopological\nsoliton model[3], Skyrme topological soliton model[4], the constituent quark model[5], etc.\nDifferent models use quite different effective degrees of freedom, which might be indicative\nof the nature of low-energy QCD. Under different approximations one can \"derive\" these\nmodels from QCD[6]. Recently there has been a hot debate regarding the proper effective\ndegrees of freedom of the constituent quark model[7].\nWe performed a phenomenological study of the baryon interactions with three constituent quark models, the Glozman-Riska-Brown quark-meson coupling model[8], the Fujiwara quark-gluon-meson coupling model \u2013 one version of the Manohar-Georgi chiral quark\nmodel[9], and the quark delocalization, color screening model(QDCSM) developed by ourselves \u2013 a modified version of the de Rujula-Georgi-Glashow-Isgur quark gluon coupling\nmodel[10, 11, 12], and found that, in about 2/3 of the channels formed from the octet and\ndecuplet baryons, these three models gave qualitatively the same effective baryon-baryon\n(B-B) interactions[13]. These constituent quark models have the same long range Goldstone\nboson exchange interaction, (except for the QDCSM,) but have different mechanisms for\nthe intermediate and short range interactions when they are used to study B-B interactions.\nPresent data on baryon spectroscopy and B-B interactions seem to be insufficient to distinguish between these models and they all seem to have an approximate QCD basis[6]. A new\ngeneration of hadron spectroscopy should be helpful in disentangling these hadronic models.\nThere are good reasons, both theoretically and phenomenologically, to believe that a two\nbody confinement potential might be a good approximation for single hadrons. However\nthere is no compelling reason to believe it is also a good approximation for multihadron\nsystems. Dibaryons provide a good testing ground for different confinement mechanisms\n2\n\n\fand baryon interaction models. Being the unique, stable, B=2 system, and its size, binding\nenergy and quadrupole moment having been measured very precisely, the deuteron plays a\nvital role in the development of NN interaction models. Since the H-particle, a dibaryon\nwith strangeness S = \u22122, isospin I=0 and spin J=0, was first predicted by the MIT bag\nmodel in 1977[14], tremendous efforts have been made both experimentally and theoretically\nto search for it. Up to now there is no experimental evidence for the H.\nOther dibaryon candidates have also been discussed in the literature. An S=0, J P = 0\u2212 ,\nM\u223c2.06 GeV, \u0393\u223c0.5 MeV, I=0 or 2 dibaryon, d\u2032 , was a hot topic in the 1990's[15, 16].\nThe S=0, I=0, J P = 3+ dibaryon, d\u2217 , has also been a long standing topic; almost all quark\nmodels predict there should be attraction in this channel but with differing strengths in\nthe different models[12, 17, 18, 19, 20]. In 1987, we showed that the S=-3, I=1/2, J=2\ndibaryon state might be a narrow resonance in a relativistic quark model [21]. In 1990,\nV. B. Kopeliovich et al.[22] predicted that there are strong interaction stable dibaryons\nwith high strangeness, such as an S=-6, di-\u03a9 within the flavor SU(3) Skyrmion model. A\ngeneral survey of dibaryon states carried out with both the nonrelativistic QDCSM and the\nrelativistic version, using an adiabatic calculation, found few high strangeness states with\nmasses around the lowest threshold[18, 19]. Zhang et al.[23] predicted that the \u03a9\u03a9 I=0,\nJ=0 dibaryon is strong interaction stable using a chiral SU(3) quark model.\nIn this study, we use the extended QDCSM [12] to calculate the eigen energy of the di-\u03a9\nstate SIJ = \u22126, 0, 0. This model allows the quark system to choose its most favorable\nconfiguration through its own dynamics in a larger Hilbert space than the other models,\nand takes into account the possible difference of the confinement interaction inside a single\nbaryon and between two color singlet baryons. In particular, this is the unique model that\ngives an explanation of the similarity between molecular and nuclear forces. It also explains\nwhy nuclei are accurately viewed as a collection of nucleons rather than a single big bag\nwith 3A quarks.\nHere, we recalculate the QDCSM result because the extended QDCSM reproduces the\ndeuteron properties well quantitatively, unlike the QDCSM, and because preliminary NN\nphase shift calculations using it fit the NN, N\u039b, N\u03a3 scattering data better than the earlier\nQDCSM calculations, which fit the data only qualitatively [11, 12]. Consequently, we expect\nthis extended QDCSM calculation will provide a better model estimate of the mass of the\ndi-\u03a9.\n3\n\n\fIn the following section, we give a short description of the extended QDCSM. The results\nand a discussion are presented in section III.\n\nII.\n\nSHORT DESCRIPTION OF THE EXTENDED QDCSM\n\nThe details of the QDCSM and its extension can be found in Refs.[11, 12, 18] and the\nresonating-group calculation method (RGM) has been presented in Refs.[20, 24]. Here we\npresent only the (complete) extended model Hamiltonian, wave functions and the necessary\nequations used in the current calculation.\nThe Hamiltonian for the 3-quark system is the same as the usual quark potential model.\nFor the six-quark system, it is assumed to be\nH6 =\n\n6\nX\n\n(mi +\n\ni=1\n\n6\nX\np2i\n) \u2212 TCM +\n(Vconf (rij ) + VG (rij ) + V\u03c7 (rij )) ,\n2mi\ni<j=1\n\n#\n\u0012\n\u0013\n~\u03bbc * ~\u03bbc \" 1\n\u0010\n\u0011\n2\n\u03c0\u03b4(~r)\n1\ni\nj\n\u2212\n1 + ~\u03c3i * ~\u03c3j +\n3(~\u03c3i * ~\u02c6r)(~\u03c3j * ~\u02c6r ) \u2212 ~\u03c3i * ~\u03c3j ,\nVG (rij ) = \u03b1s\n4\nrij\nmi mj\n3\n4mi mj r 3\n\nV\u03c7 (rij ) = {\n\n3\nX\n\na=1\n\nf,a\nV\u03c0 (rij )\u03bbf,a\ni * \u03bbj +\n\n\u03bc2\u03b3\n\ng82\n\n7\nX\n\nb=4\n\nf,b\n8\n8\nVk (rij )\u03bbf,b\ni * \u03bbj + V\u03b7 (rij )\u03bbi * \u03bbj },\n\n1 \u2212\u03bc\u03b3 r\ne\n4\u03c0 12mi mj r\n!\n!#\n\"\n3\n3(~\u03c3i * ~r)(~\u03c3j * ~r)\n3\n\u2212 ~\u03c3i * ~\u03c3j\n+1 ,\n\u00d7 ~\u03c3i * ~\u03c3j +\n+\nr2\n(\u03bc\u03b3 r)2 \u03bc\u03b3 r\n2\ngqq\u03c0\n3 2 g2\n= ( ) NN\u03c0 ,\n4\u03c0\n5\n4\u03c0\n2 2\n2\n3 g\nmq 2\ng8\n= ( ) NN\u03c0 (\n)\n4\u03c0\n5\n4\u03c0 mN\n\nV\u03b3 (rij ) = \u03b8(r \u2212 r0 )\n\nVconf (rij ) = \u2212ac~\u03bbi * ~\u03bbj\n\u03b8(r \u2212 r0 ) =\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f20\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f31\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\nrij2\n\n(1)\n\u03b3 = \u03c0, K, \u03b7\n\nif i, j occur in the same baryon orbit,\n\n\u2212\u03bcr 2\nij\n1\u2212e\n\n\u03bc\n\nif i, j occur in different baryon orbits,\n\nr < r0 ,\notherwise,\n\nwhere ~\u03c3i , ~\u03bbci and ~\u03bbfi are, respectively, the spin, color and flavor operators of the ith quark.\nThe spin operators are represented by the three 2 \u00d7 2 Pauli matrices, and the color and\nflavor operators are represented by the eight 3 \u00d7 3 Gell-Mann matrices. The \u03bc\u03b3 are the\nmasses of the Goldstone bosons (\u03b3 = \u03c0, K, \u03b7). We assume a single quark-meson coupling\n\n4\n\n\fconstant g82 /4\u03c0 for all mesons. The confinement potential Vconf (rij ) has been discussed in\nRefs.[16, 20].\nWe obtained the values of b, \u03b1s and ac by reproducing the N \u2212 \u2206 mass difference, the\nnucleon mass and applying a stability condition. The mass of the u, d quark is assumed\nto be 1/3 of the nucleon mass to meet the requirements of the resonating group method\n(RGM) calculation while the strange quark mass ms is determined by an overall fit to the\nbaryon octet and decuplet. A flavor symmetric overall octet quark-meson coupling constant\nis assumed for all of the octet mesons (\u03c0, K, \u03b7).\nThe color screening parameter \u03bc is determined by the binding energy of the deuteron.\nThe full set of parameters reproduces other properties of deuteron as well: the size and\nthe D-S wave mixing amplitude. It is worth emphasizing that the extended QDCSM has\nonly one parameter, the color screening constant \u03bc, that needs to be adjusted to obtain\nthe correct binding energy of the deuteron, and that this is sufficient to reproduce well\nall of the properties of the deuteron. The tensor force of pion exchange plays a vital role\nin reproducing the deuteron properties quantitatively, but the results are not extremely\nsensitive to the meson exchange cutoff parameter, r0 .\nAfter introducing Gaussian functions with different reference centers Si , i=1...n, which\nplay the role of the generating coordinates in this formalism, and including the wave function\nfor the center-of-mass motion[25], the ansatz for the two-cluster wave function used in the\nRGM can be written as\n\u03a86q\n\n6\n3\nY\nd\u03a9Si Y\n~\n~i , \u01eb)\n\u221a\n\u03c8\u03b1 (Si , \u01eb)\n\u03c8\u03b2 (\u2212S\n= A\nCk,i,Lk\n4\u03c0\n\u03b1=1\n\u03b2=4\nk i=1 Lk =0,2\n\u02c6\n[[\u03b7I1k S1k (B1k )\u03b7I2k S2k (B2k )]ISk Y Lk (S~i )]J [\u03c7c (B1 )\u03c7c (B2 )][\u03c3] ,\nn\nXX\nX\n\nZ\n\n(2)\n\nwhere k is the channel index.

For comparison, the results of\nour earlier calculation [18] without \u03c0 meson exchange are also included in Table I. In order to\nstudy the dependence of the result on the short range cutoff radius, we choose three typical\nvalues: 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0 fm, for the short-range cutoff of the \u03c0 meson exchange potential.\nThis cutoff is necessary in our model approach because all short and intermediate range\neffects are already represented by the quark delocalization and color screening: The short\nrange repulsion of the NN interaction is provided by a combination of the color magnetic\ninteraction due to gluon exchange and the Pauli principle enforced by the quark structure\nof the nucleon; the intermediate range attraction conventionally modeled by heavy meson\nand multimeson exchange is also provided by quark delocalization and color screening. If\nthe contact term of single \u03c0 meson exchange, \u03b4(~r), or its smeared version, exp(\u2212\u039br)/(\u039br),\nwere used, double counting[12] would occur. In all cases, we found that the contribution\n6\n\n\fof \u03c0 meson exchange to the dibaryon mass is not large (about 10 MeV or less), primarily\ndue to the effect of the short-range cutoff; correspondingly, the deviations from the original\nQDCSM parameters are also quite small.\nTable I.

The mass of the \u03a9\u03a9, which is close to the threshold\n(3344.9 MeV) in the adiabatic approximation, is reduced below the threshold by about\n33 MeV. Several effects contribute to this difference, but the most important one is that\nthe resonating group method calculates the relative motion between the two quark clusters\nrigorously, greatly improving over the rough estimate of the kinetic energy by the zero-point\noscillation energy used in the adiabatic approximation.\nWe note that one should not expect all baryon-baryon (B-B) states to be modified significantly by the dynamical calculation. If the effective B-B interaction has a narrow minimum\nwith respect to the separation variable, then the zero-point oscillation energy provides a\ngood approximation to the kinetic energy of the relative motion of the two clusters. For\nexample, the d\u2217 mass does not change very much between the adiabatic and dynamic calculations. However, if the effective B-B interaction is flat, then the zero-point oscillation\nenergy may be not a good approximation for the kinetic energy of the relative motion; the\ndi-\u03a9 is such a case[13].\nThe first three columns show the dynamical mass of the di-\u03a9 with (only) \u03c0 meson exchange included but with different cutoff parameters. Comparing these three results with\n7\n\n\fthe fourth column, one can see that the di-\u03a9 mass is reduced by between 9 and 22 MeV.\nThis is due to the fact that the parameters of the model are modified by inclusion of the\npion even though the pion is not exchanged between s quarks. The binding energies vary\nfrom 55 MeV to 40 MeV with different cutoffs. The larger the cut off, the smaller is the\neffect on the di-\u03a9 mass.\nThe last two rows show that the effect of channel coupling caused by the meson tensor\nforce is quite small here. The S and D wave coupled channel masses (cc) are almost the\nsame as those of the single channel approximation (sc). In the deuteron, the effect on the\nmass of the state, although almost an order of magnitude larger and more significant there,\nwas also found to be small. By contrast, as shown below, the D-S wave mixing in both cases\nis comparable.\nThe quark spin-orbit interaction has been neglected in the Hamiltonian (1). We would\nexpect it to have a similarly significant effect on the D-wave channel. However, its effect\non the di-\u03a9 mass is expected to be small because the D-wave channel coupling itself only\naffects the di-\u03a9 mass slightly.\nFig.1 shows the relative motion wave functions for two different cutoff parameters. They\nare not sensitive to the short-range cutoff parameter, r0 . Fig.2 shows the effective \u03a9 \u2212 \u03a9\npotential corresponding to the cutoff r0 = 0.8f m. The other cutoffs give almost indistinguishable effective potentials.\nAs has been mentioned above, the effects of short and intermediate range interaction\narising from \u03c0 meson exchange are represented by quark delocalization and color screening,\nso the only long range effect in our model comes from \u03c0 exchange. The effects of heavy\npseudoscalar meson (K, \u03b7) exchange on the mass of the di-\u03a9 have been checked with a\nrepresentative cutoff of r0 = 0.8f m. The results are presented in Table II.\n\n8\n\n\fTable II.

Comparing the results in Table I and II, we find the mass of the di-\u03a9 is almost\nunaffected by the addition of K and \u03b7 exchange. This confirms our expectation that heavier\n(shorter ranged) meson exchanges are already represented by quark effects in our model, so\nthat explicit representation of such exchanges beyond a cut-off scale are not important in\nour approach.\nIn summary, within the framework of the extended QDCSM, using a resonating group\nmethod, we estimate the mass of the di-\u03a9 to be about 45 MeV lower than the \u03a9 \u2212 \u03a9\nthreshold. This mass is almost unaffected by channel coupling, the value of the short range\ncutoff length, r0 , and heavier pseudoscalar meson exchanges. The inclusion of single pion\nor heavier meson exchange has only a minor effect on the di-\u03a9 mass. These results are\nconsistent with the calculations of Kopeliovich and of Zhang et al.[22, 23].\nWe should, however, take note that the precision of any prediction of the di-\u03a9 mass is\nlimited by that of the model itself. For example, in our model approach, the mass of the \u03a9\nitself is found to be 1651 MeV, or 21 Mev less than the measured value. It could well be\nargued that this theoretical mass of the \u03a9 should be used to calculate the threshold. We\nwould then conclude that the di-\u03a9 mass is no more than 5 MeV below threshold. From\nthe model deviations from experimental values for single baryon masses, we estimate a total\nsystematic uncertainty of order 30 MeV as a reasonable value to assign to our model.\n9\n\n\fMoreover, it is difficult to estimate how much of the model uncertainty is carried over to\nthe dibaryon calculation for such a high strangeness quark system, because the model parameters are mainly determined by the experimental data of the nonstrange sector. Therefore,\nwhen designing a detector system to hunt for the di-\u03a9 state, it is theoretically advisable to\ntake into account the possibility that the di-\u03a9 may be either stable or unstable with respect\nto the strong interaction.\nThis work is partly supported by the HIRFL-CSR theoretical center, the NSF and SED\nof China, and partly by the US Department of Energy under contract W-7405-ENG-36.\n\n[1] A.Chodos, R.L.
