I review the basic questions of this\nsearch and summarize recent theoretical developments in the field.\n1. New States of Matter\nStatistical QCD predicts that high temperatures and baryon densities will lead to\nnew states of strongly interacting matter. Increasing T at low baryon density transforms\na meson gas into a deconfined plasma of quarks and gluons (QGP); this transition has\nbeen studied extensively in computer simulations of finite temperature lattice QCD. High\nbaryon densities at low T are expected to produce a condensate of colored diquarks.\nThe resulting phase diagram in terms of temperature and baryochemical potential \u03bc is\nschematically illustrated in Fig. 1, with hadronic matter as color insulator, the QGP as\ncolor conductor, and the diquark condensate as color superconductor.\nT\nTc\nQuark-Gluon-Plasma\nHadronic\nMatter\n\nDiquark Condensate\n\u03bcc\n\n\u03bc\n\nFigure 1: Phase diagram of strongly interacting matter.\nWith high energy nuclear collisions, we want to study in the laboratory the deconfinement transition and the properties of the QGP. Hard probes, such as the production of\nquarkonia, open charm and beauty, jets and photons are expected to provide information\n1\n\nConcluding talk at the International Workshop on the Physics of the Quark-Gluon Plasma, \u00c9cole\nPolytechnique, Palaiseau/France, Sept. 4 - 7, 2001\n\n1\n\n\fabout the hot early stages of the produced medium. The masses and decays of different\nhadrons, their momenta, correlations and relative abundances constitute the soft probes\nto study the later stages of the medium and its freeze-out.\nIn this concluding talk, I will summarize some recent theoretical developments in the\nfield, without any claim to completeness. My emphasis will be on concepts more than on\nspecific models, and on questions more than on answers.\n2. Thermalization\nSince the basic purpose of the experimental program is to produce strongly interacting\nmatter, it is of central importance to determine if, how and when the non-thermal initial\nstate of two colliding nuclei becomes thermalized.\nIn a nuclear collision, the incoming nucleons or their secondaries can interact with the\nother target nucleons. This results in nuclear phenomena such as the Cronin effect, normal\nnuclear quarkonium suppression or parton energy loss in normal nuclear matter. These\neffects do not involve any new produced medium. To achieve that, the secondaries coming\nfrom different sources must interact, a phenomenon referred to as color interconnection,\nexogamous behavior or cross talk [1].\n+ \u2212\n\u221a A test for such cross-talk has been considered in e e annihilation into hadrons at\ns = 2MW , as studied in LEP experiments at CERN [2]. The reaction first leads to\nW + W \u2212 production; subsequently, one possibility is that each of the two W 's decays into\na q q\u0304 pair, which then hadronizes. An alternative channel has one of the two W 's undergo\nleptonic decay into a neutrino and a lepton. In the case of cross talk, it is predicted\n[1] that for the resulting hadron multiplicities, Nh (q1 q\u03041 , q2 q\u03042 ) 6= 2Nh (q q\u0304, \u03bdl); in addition,\nthe source radii obtained through HBT studies should be different in the two channels.\nNeither of these predictions is supported by LEP data, so that so far there is no evidence\nof cross talk shown by the hadrons produced in high energy e+ e\u2212 annihilation. This also\nexcludes cross talk at earlier partonic stages.\nDo AA collisions with their much higher density of superimposed interactions lead to\ncross talk? We address this question by looking at hadron abundances. It is found that\nthese are quite well described by the predictions of an ideal resonance gas [3], parametrized\nin grand-canonical form by a freeze-out temperature Tf and a baryochemical potential\n\u03bcB . With increasing collision energy Tf converges to about 170 MeV (Fig. 2). This alone\ndoes not, however, allow us to conclude that we have indeed obtained a thermal system\nwith full cross-talk. It is known [5] that also the elementary hadroproduction processes\ninitiated by e+ e\u2212 annihilation or pp/pp\u0304 scattering lead to thermal hadron abundances,\nwith freeze-out temperatures which agree very well with those observed in AA collisions;\nthey are included in Fig. 2. There is, however, one important difference: in the elementary\nreactions, there are fewer strange hadrons than predicted by a grand-canonical resonance\ngas, while AA collisions do not show such a strangeness reduction. The change in relative\nstrangeness production, referred to as strangeness suppression or enhancement, depending\non the point of view, has found a very natural explanation in the observation [6] that in\nelementary processes, with rarely more than one ss\u0304 pair per interaction region, strangeness\nconservation has to be taken into account exactly and not just \"on the average\", as implied\nin a grand-canonical formulation. It had in fact been observed long ago that the exact\nlocal conservation of quantum numbers can reduce the relative production rates by several\norders of magnitude in comparison to the average grand-canonical rates [7].\n2\n\n\fTf[MeV]\n200\n\nLHC\n\n100\n\ns1/2[GeV]\n0\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1000\n\nFigure 2: Freeze-out temperatures for hadron resonances produced in nucleus-nucleus\n(filled triangles), p \u2212 p (open triangles), p \u2212 p\u0304 (circles) and e+ e\u2212 interactions (squares).\nData are given in [3-5].\nThe transition from exact to average (grand-canonical) strangeness conservation does\nimply, however, that the AA collisions behave as one large system, not as a sum of many\nelementary collisions. The strange hadrons produced in one elementary collision of an AA\ninteraction must be aware of the strange hadrons produced in other NN collisions, if a\ngrand-canonical description is valid. So at least at the hadronization stage of the medium\nproduced in nuclear collisions, there is cross talk \u2013 it makes sense to speak of a large-scale\nhadronic medium.\nOne remaining question in this context is the correct treatment of hidden strangeness;\nif the ss\u0304 nature of the \u03c6 is not taken into account, its production rates are quite generally\noverpredicted.\nIn addition, there remains the tantalizing question of why the hadron abundances in\nelementary processes like e+ e\u2212 or pp/pp\u0304 already follow the pattern predicted by an ideal\nresonance gas. It might just indicate that the non-perturbative hadronization of quarks\nand gluons simply proceeds such as to maximize the entropy: partons hadronize into the\nstates of a resonance gas with largest phase space. The associated temperature is then the\nlimiting temperature of such a system, the Hagedorn temperature, and hence is universal.\nSince the initial structure of e.g. e+ e\u2212 \u2192 hadrons is that of a fast q q\u0304 pair emitting\ngluons which later hadronize, the annihilation process is certainly not thermal in its early\nstages. Thermal hadron abundances thus do not imply that the previous partonic system\nwas already thermal.\nPartonic cross talk is the basic input of most parton cascade models and thus has been\nconsidered in the corresponding codes for quite some time. Its role in the establishment of\nparton thermalization has recently been addressed in an interesting conceptual treatment\n[8]. The two incoming nuclei can be viewed in the central rapidity region (where the\nvalence quarks are unimportant) as gluon beams in which each gluon has a transverse\nradius rg \u223c 1/kT determined by its transverse momentum kT . The geometric interaction\ncross section for gluon of sufficient hardness, kT \u2265 q0 , is \u03c3g \u223c \u03b1s (q0 )rg2 . We would like\nto know when these gluons of sufficient hardness begin to overlap in the transverse area\ndetermined by the nuclear radius RA . Full cross talk evidently occurs when a gluon on\n2\nis connected by overlapping gluons to a partner on the\none side of the nuclear disk \u03c0RA\n3\n\n\fother side of the disk. This starts at the percolation point\n2\nNg \u03c3g \u2243 \u03c0RA\n,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Ng (kT ) = Axg(x) denotes the number of \u221a\ngluons as determined from the gluon\ndistribution function g(x) at central Bjorken x \u223c s. From Eq. (1) we thus obtain\nqs2 \u223c \u03b1s A1/3 xg(x)\n\n(2)\n\nfor the saturation momentum qs . When kT >> qs , the gluons form a dilute and hence\ndisjoint system in the transverse plane, without cross talk. At kT = qs percolation sets\nin and the gluons form a connected interacting system, with full cross talk. For such a\nsystem, one can estimate that thermalization occurs after a time\n\u03c40 \u223c \u03b1s\u221213/5 qs\u22121 ,\n\n(3)\n\nleading to a thermal gluon medium of temperature\nT0 \u223c \u03b1s2/5 qs .\n(4)\n\u221a\nFrom deep inelastic scattering one has xg(x) \u223c ( s)\u03bb , with \u03bb \u2243 0.2. Together \u221a\nwith Eq.\n(2), this implies that large nuclei (large A) and/or high collision energies (large s) lead\nto early parton thermalization and a hot QGP. A very important task for theory is clearly\nto turn these conceptual considerations into a quantitative formalism.\n3. Hadrons in Matter\nDo AA collisions produce an interacting hadronic medium, or does the earlier partonic state hadronize directly into an ideal resonance gas? That is the main question to\nbe addressed here. It is of particular interest in view of chiral symmetry restoration. For\ntemperatures T < Tc , the massless quarks of the QCD Lagrangian LQCD \"dress\" themselves through gluon interactions to become constituent quarks with an effective mass\nMq \u223c 0.3 - 0.4 GeV, thereby spontaneously breaking the chiral symmetry of LQCD . For\nT = Tc , chiral symmetry is restored and Mq \u2192 0; we have here assumed a system of vanishing baryon number density, for which deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration\ncoincide at T = Tc . Since the vector meson mass M\u03c1 \u2243 2Mq , the behavior of M\u03c1 (T ) in\nan interacting hadronic medium for T \u2192 Tc would be a way to study the onset of chiral\nsymmetry restoration.\nThe in-medium behavior of hadron masses can be calculated in finite temperature\nlattice QCD. First studies addressed the temperature dependence of the screening mass\nin quenched QCD. Below Tc , they showed very little T -dependence; but in view of the\nnoted simplifications, they are presumably not really conclusive. Today it is possible\nto calculate the actual pole mass, but with present computer performance still only for\nthe quenched case [9]. The advent of more powerful computers in the next 2 - 3 years\nshould, however, lead to such calculations in full QCD with light quarks. The present\nquenched studies show that above Tc , there are no more mesonic bound states; scalar and\npseudoscalar correlations agree, indicating chiral symmetry restoration. Below Tc , the\nresults for the pole masses also show rather little T -dependence; however, this may well\nbe an artifact of quenching, as the following considerations seem to indicate.\n4\n\n\fLattice studies of the heavy quark potential VQ (T, r) in full QCD (with light dynamical\nquarks) show at all temperatures T string breaking in the large distance limit r \u2192 \u221e.\nAt T = 0, the string connecting two heavy color charges should break when its energy\nsurpasses the mass of a typical light hadron, or equivalently when\nVQ (T, r = \u221e) \u2243 2Mq (T ).\n\n(5)\n\nHence Mq (T ) can be determined in finite temperature lattice calculations of VQ (T, r).\nNote, however, that the constituent quark mass here is obtained from a heavy-light meson\nand could contain some dressing of the heavy quark; hence it need not coincide fully with\nthat from a light-light meson such as the \u03c1. Heavy quark potential studies have recently\nbeen carried out for Nf = 2 and 3 for a range of different quark masses [10]. They show\nin particular that\n\u2022 for mq <\n\u223c 0.4 T \u2243 60 MeV, the dependence of VQ on mq becomes negligible, indicating that the chiral limit is reached;\n\u2022 string breaking occurs earlier (at smaller r) with increasing temperature (Fig. 5);\n\u2022 from VQ (T = 0, r = \u221e) \u2243 1 GeV it follows that Mq (T = 0) \u2243 0.5 GeV, while for\nT \u2192 Tc , VQ (T ) and hence also Mq (T ) vanish.\nThe resulting temperature dependence of the heavy quark potential is shown in Fig. 3. It\nis seen that the approach of chiral symmetry restoration leads to a pronounced variation\nof VQ (T, \u221e) and hence of Mq (T ) with T . This suggests that also the mass of the \u03c1-meson\nshould show such a temperature variation, in contrast to the present pole-mass results\nfrom quenched lattice QCD. A study of the temperature dependence of hadron masses in\nunquenched lattice calculations would thus be of great interest.\n2.5\n\nV\u221e/\u03c31/2\n\n2\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n0\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nT/Tc\n\nFigure 3: Temperature dependence of the string breaking potential VQ (T, \u221e) in units of\nthe string tension \u03c3.\n4. Partons in Matter\nSince the energy loss of a fast parton passing through a medium will depend on the\nnature of this medium, jet quenching should provide a tool to specify the state of matter\n5\n\n\fproduced in nuclear collisions. At lower momenta, the energy loss can occur through\nionisation of the constituents of the medium; at high momenta, gluon radiation of the\npassing parton is the main mechanism.\nThe crucial feature in radiative energy loss is the formation time t(k) or the formation\nlength z(k) for a gluon of momentum k, compared to the intrinsic scales of the medium:\nthe mean free path \u03bb, the mean distance d between scattering centers and the overall\nlinear size L of the medium. For \u03bb > d > z(k), the radiated gluons see independent\ncharges and the scattering is incoherent. For d < \u03bb < z(k), there is coherent scattering\nof the nascent gluon with several scatterers, leading to destructive interference; this is\nthe so-called Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM) effect which reduces the energy loss.\nIn Fig. 4 we compare schematically the incoherent\nform dE/dz \u223c \u2212E, where E is the\n\u221a\nparton energy, to the LPM form dE/dz \u223c \u2212 E.

(6) leads to an energy loss of about 30 GeV; this is to be compared to indications\nthat cold nuclear matter of the same size would only result in an energy loss of 2 GeV\n[12]. In contrast to the QGP results, the value for a normal nuclear medium is really only\nan estimate, and thus only jet production data from pA collisions can provide a reliable\nbasis for comparison.\nAnother problem is immediately evident from the QGP calculation. What transverse\nmomenta are really needed to specify a jet? Present RHIC data stop around at leading\nparticles of some 5 GeV, which presumably is well below the value for the jets assumed\nin the QCD studies.\nWe add a comment here on the interpretation of the RHIC results on high pT hadrons.\nThe measured spectra have to be compared to some reference spectrum in order to look\nfor a possible quenching, and this is generally based on binary collisions: the spectra\n6\n\n\ffrom central AA collisions are normalized to pp (or peripheral AA) data multiplied by\nthe number of binary collisions. The resulting ratio (see Fig. 5) is well below unity in\nthe entire range 0 <\n\u223c pT <\n\u223c 5 GeV. If one would instead use the number of wounded\nnucleons as reference, the corresponding ratio will be larger than unity for almost all\nvalues of pT . From multiplicity studies it is clear that the overall data, dominated by low\nto intermediate pT , are well below what is expected from binary collision scaling. Hence\nin order to obtain a reliable reference, one should use an interpolating form of the type\ndN\ndp2T\n\n!ref\n\n\"\n\n= Nw\n\nAA\n\np2T\n1\u2212\na + p2T\n\n!\n\n+ Nc\n\np2T\na + p2T\n\n!#\n\ndN\ndp2T\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(7)\n\npp\n\nwhere Nw denotes the number of wounded nucleons and Nc the number of binary collisions; the parameter a determines the relative importance of the two types of production\nmechanisms. Instead of being set to zero, as in present studies, it should be choses such as\nto correctly reproduce the measured multiplicity. This is expected to lead to a behavior\nlike that shown in Fig. 5, with a Cronin-like pattern at relatively low pT followed by a\nsuppression below unity, and one could then clearly define quenching effects.\nThe last point to be addressed in this section concerns the radiative energy loss of\nheavy quarks traversing a QGP. It was noted [13] that for massive quarks the gluon\nemission suffers a 'dead-cone' effect, which suppresses radiation for forward angles\nq\n\n2\n2\n\u03b8<\n\u223c MQ / PQ + MQ ,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere MQ denotes the mass of the heavy quarks. This radiation suppresion in turn reduces\nthe energy loss of heavy quarks and thus predicts an increase of the ratio D/\u03c0 for high\npT .\n(dN/dPT2)AA\nref\n(dN/dPT2)AA\n\nCronin\n\n1\n\njet quenching\n\nPT\n\nFigure 5: Expected transverse momentum distribution from AA collisions normalized to\na reference distribution interpolating from a wounded nucleon to a binary collision model\n(see Eq. 7).\n5. Quarkonia in Matter\nThe essential feature that distinguishes the quarkonium ground states J/\u03c8 and \u03a5 from\nthe normal light hadrons is their much smaller radius (about 0.2 fm for the J/\u03c8 and about\n7\n\n\f0.1 fm for the \u03a5), due to the much higher bare quark mass (mc \u2243 1.4 GeV, mb \u2243 4.5 GeV).\nTheir binding is thus largely due to the Coulombic part of the QCD potential \u03c3r\u2212\u03b1/r; the\nstring tension \u03c3 does not matter very much. Equivalently, the gluon dressing which makes\nmassive constituent quarks out of the almost massless light quarks (with Mq \u2243 0.3 \u2212 0.4\nGeV) has little effect on the heavy quarks. In a medium approaching the deconfinement\npoint, for T \u2192 Tc , the string tension vanishes: \u03c3(T ) \u2192 0, as does the constituent quark\nmass because of chiral symmetry restoration, Mq \u2192 0. As a consequence, light and\nlight-heavy hadrons disappear, but sufficiently tightly bound quarkonia will persist even\nabove Tc and can thus serve as probes of the quark-gluon plasma. These arguments also\nsuggest that quarkonium masses decrease less with temperature than the masses of the\nopen charm or beauty mesons D and B. As a consequence, the open charm threshold\ncan in a hot medium fall below the mass of previously stable higher excited charmonium\nstates and thus allow their strong decay, and similarly for bottomonia.\nWe therefore want to compare 2MD (T ) with Mi (T ), where i specifies \u03c8 \u2032 , \u03c7 and J/\u03c8, as\nwell as the corresponding b-quark states. For the masses of the open charm/beauty states,\nwe make use of the lattice studies already introduced in section 3. The string breaking\npotential introduced there determines with V (T, r = \u221e) \u2243 2Mq (T ) \u2243 2(MD \u2212 mc ) effectively the D-mass. The quarkonium masses can be obtained by solving the Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation with the potential V (r, T ) determined in the same lattice studies. Comparing\nthe temperature dependence of the light-heavy masses to that of the quarkonium states\nshows two distinct types of behavior [14, 15].\nIn Fig. 6 we see that with increasing temperature 2MD and 2MB indeed drop below the\nmasses of the highest excited states, \u03c8 \u2032 and \u03c7c for charmonia, \u03a5\" and \u03c7\u2032b for bottomonia,\nrespectively, before the deconfinement point is reached. These states thus disappear\nin a hot hadronic medium through in-medium decay into open charm/beauty. If the\ndissociation thresholds are experimentally measured, they thus specify the temperature\nof the hot but still confined system at four different points, tracing out the approach of\nchiral symmetry restoration.\nThe mass gaps of J/\u03c8, \u03a5', \u03c7b and \u03a5 at T = 0 are much larger than \u039bQCD , so that we\nexpect them to survive deconfinement and be dissociated only by color screening in the\nquark-gluon plasma, as originally proposed for the J/\u03c8 [16]. This dissociation sets in when\nthe intrinsic scale of the quarkonium, its radius, falls below the screening radius as the scale\ncharacterizing the medium. In Fig. 7 this effect is seen to occur for the \u03a5 at T \u2243 2.3 Tc .\nThe other mentioned states persist up to about Tc when compared to open charm/beauty\nmasses (see Fig. 6); in a screening approach, they are dissociated in a QGP just slightly\nabove Tc (see Fig. 7 for the J/\u03c8). Given the accuracy of the present lattice results near\ndeconfinement, and in view of the possible break-down of a Schr\u00f6dinger equation near Tc ,\nwe can thus only conclude that J/\u03c8, \u03c7b and \u03a5' are dissociated approximately at Tc .\nWe thus obtain a thermal quarkonium dissociation pattern which indeed is very similar\nto that provided by the spectral lines from stellar matter [18]. The suppression thresholds\nfor \u03c8 \u2032 , \u03c7c , \u03a5\" and \u03c7\u2032b specify a hot hadronic medium different temperatures; when the\nJ/\u03c8, \u03a5' and \u03c7b disappear, deconfinement is reached, and the dissociation point of the\n\u03a5 indicates a hot QGP, with T > 2 Tc .\nThe observed production of J/\u03c8 and \u03a5 occurs in part through the decay of higher\nexcited states, such as \u03c7c \u2192 J/\u03c8; the respective fractions of the different contributions are\nknown experimentally or can be determined from data [15]. Since such decays take place\n8\n\n\f3.8\n\n10.6\n10.4\n\n3.6\n\n10.2\n\n2S\n\n3.2\n\nM [GeV]\n\n3.4\nM [GeV]\n\n3S\n2P\n\n1P\n\n1S\n\n3\n\n2S\n1P\n\n10\n9.8\n9.6\n\n2.8\n\n1S\n\n9.4\n\n2.6\n\n9.2\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\nT/Tc\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nT/Tc\n\nFigure 6: Temperature dependence of (left) open charm and (right) open beauty masses\n(heavy lines) vs. charmonium and bottomonium masses.\n\n2\nJ/\u03c8\n1.5\n\n1\nr0(T)\n\n\u03a5\n\n0.5\n\n0\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\nT/Tc\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\nFigure 7: Temperature dependence of the screening radius vs. the bound state radii of\n\u03a5 and J/\u03c8, in fm.\nfar outside the interaction region, the produced medium sees and suppresses the different\n'parent' states. This leads to the well-known sequential suppression pattern [17, 15]\nwhich distinguishes thermal threshold behavior such as deconfinement form dissociation\nby hadronic comover scattering (see [19] for a survey). Perhaps the most interesting\nfeature which has so far emerged from nuclear collision studies is the observation of just\nsuch a multistep structure of J/\u03c8 suppression [20]. Future experiments, both at CERN\n(NA60) and at RHIC, will undoubtedly provide further details to check if this structure\nis indeed due to sequential quarkonium suppression.\nOur considerations so far have ignored possible fluctuations of the medium. To illstrate, we note that for T > 0 the mass of the D and to a lesser extent the mass of the \u03c7c\nwill fluctuate around the values we have here calculated. Instead of a \u03b4-function, we will\nhave a peak with a certain width (collision broadening), which in principle can be provided by lattice calculations. For a conclusive study of sequential quarkonium suppression\nin nuclear collision this would seem a prerequisite.\n9\n\n\fA second open question concerning applications to experiment is a reliable determination of the energy densities or temperatures attained there. All present lattice studies\nfind Tc \u2243 0.15 \u2212 0.20 GeV for the deconfinement temperature; the corresponding energy\ndensity is \u01eb(Tc ) \u2243 1 GeV/fm3 , although it then grows quickly to values near the StefanBoltzmann limit, so that \u01eb(1.1 Tc ) \u2243 2 GeV/fm3 . Presently quoted values for the energy\ndensities in P b \u2212 P b collisions at the CERN-SPS are in the range 2 - 3.5 GeV/fm3 ; they\nare based on Bjorken's estimate, which for central collisions gives\n\u01eb\u2243\n\ndNh\ndy\n\n!\n\ny=0\n\np0\n,\n2\n\u03c0RA\n\u03c40\n\n(9)\n\nwhere dNh /dy denotes the multiplicity and p0 the average energy of the produced hadrons,\nRA the nuclear radius and \u03c40 \u2243 1 fm some average formation time of the medium. Obviously the choice of \u03c40 is rather crucial, and a cross check of the reliability of the resulting\nestimates would thus seem very necessary.\nSummary\n\u2022 Hadron abundances, in nuclear collisions as well as in elementary interactions, follow\nthe pattern of an ideal resonance gas. The strangeness suppression observed in\nelementary processes appears accountable through exact strangeness conservation.\nThe observed energy independent freeze-out temperature Tf \u2243 170 MeV seems to\nreflect critical features.\n\u2022 Finite T lattice studies of the heavy quark potential V (T, r) show a significant\nvariation of the string breaking energy V (T, \u221e) for T \u2192 Tc . This could be an\nindication for a similar temperature variation of light hadron masses in full QCD.\n\u2022 Fast partons passing through a QGP suffer a considerable energy loss, which should\nbe observable for sufficiently hard jets or their decay products. Present RHIC data\nrequire a reference distribution interpolating from a wounded nucleon to a binary\ncollision form.\n\u2022 Quarkonia in hot matter can be dissociated by two distinct mechanisms. Higher\nexcited states decay strongly into open charm/beauty mesons when the masses of the\nlatter decrease as the system approaches chiral symmetry restoration. More tightly\nbound lower states survive up to deconfinement and are subsequently dissociated\nby color screening in the hot QGP.\nAcknowledgements\nIt is a pleasure to thank many colleagues for helpful comments and suggestions; particular thanks go to R.
