Motivation and perspective for an exciting new research direction interconnecting logic, spacetime theory, relativity-\nincluding such revolutionary areas as black hole physics, relativistic\ncomputers, new cosmology-are presented in this paper. We would\nlike to invite the logician reader to take part in this grand enterprise\nof the new century. Besides general perspective and motivation,\nwe present initial results in this direction.\n\n1. Introduction (logic and spacetime geometry)\nThroughout their intimately intertwined histories, logic and geometry immensely profited from their interactions. In particular, logic\ngreatly profited from its applications to geometry. Indeed, the very\nbirth of logic was brought about by the needs of geometry in the times\nof Socrates, Euclid and their predecessors. Ever since, their interactions had rejuvenating, invigorating effects on logic. For brevity, here\nwe mention only Hilbert's axiomatization of geometry, Tarski's improvements on this in the framework of first-order logic (FOL) [62],\nTarski's school of FOL approaches to geometry as a small sample. It\nis no coincidence that Tarskian algebraic logic is geometrical in spirit.\nIn this paper we try to show that this fruitful cooperation promises\nnew blessings for logic. This is so because there are breathtaking revolutions in our understanding of space and time, i.e. in relativity, cosmology, and black hole physics.\nWhat is the subject matter of geometry? Traditionally, geometry\nwas created as a mathematical theory of a physical entity called space.\nBut recent developments in spacetime theory/general relativity show\nthat there is no such thing as physical space. Space is only an illusion and as such is subjective. Space is a \"slice\" of a larger entity\ncalled spacetime. Spacetime, on the other hand, is objective, it exists. What is subjective about space is the, necessarily ad hoc, way we\ndecide to \"slice\" spacetime up into spacelike slices. Actually, it was logician Kurt G\u00f6del who first discovered and emphasized that in certain\nnon-negligible cases such slicing is impossible (non-foliazibility, in the\ntechnical terminology) [25].\nDate: 2006. Apr. 10.\n1\n\n\fFOL FOUNDATION OF RELATIVITY THEORIES\n\n2\n\nSo, a great challenge for logic and logicians is to continue the tradition sketched above of providing foundation and conceptual analysis\nfor geometry by doing the same to spacetime theory, hence to relativity.\nA further motivation for geometry-friendly logicians is the following.\nRelativity theory can be conceived of geometrizing parts of physics in\na sense, cf. [46]. Special relativity (SR) geometrizes some basic aspects\nof motion (kinematics) including light propagation; general relativity\n(GR) geometrizes gravitation + SR; the Kaluza-Klein style extension\nof GR geometrizes electromagnetic phenomena + GR; and currently\nintensively researched extensions of GR (e.g. string theory) search for\nextending the scope of this aim for geometrizing more and more aspects\nof our understanding of the world.\nWhy is this interesting for logicians? Well, because history tells\nus that logic is applicable to geometry in an essential way. Hence if\nrelativity (and its extensions) is the act of geometrizing more and more\nof physics, then it also can be regarded as a potential act of \"logicizing\"\nthese areas, inviting logicians to take part in this grandiose adventure\nof mankind.\n2. More concrete introduction (foundation of spacetime)\nThe idea of elaborating the foundational analysis of the logical structure of spacetime theory and relativity theories (foundation of relativity) in a spirit analogous with the rather successful foundation of mathematics was initiated by several authors including David Hilbert [34],\ncf. also Hilbert's 6th problem [33], Patrick Suppes [59], Alfred Tarski [32]\nand leading contemporary logician Harvey Friedman [22, 23].\nThere are several reasons for seeking an axiomatic foundation of a\nphysical theory [60]. One is that the theory may be better understood\nby providing a basis of explicit postulates for the theory. Another\nreason is that if we have an axiom system we can ask ourselves what\naxioms are responsible for which theorems. For more on this kind\nof foundational thinking called reverse mathematics, see for example,\nFriedman [22] and Simpson [56]. Furthermore, if we have an axiom system for special relativity or general relativity, we can ask what happens\nwith the theory if we change one or more of the axioms. This could\nlead us to a new physically interesting theory. This is what happened\nwith Euclid's axiom system for geometry when Bolyai and Lobachevsky\naltered the axiom of parallelism and discovered hyperbolic geometry.\nSeeking a logical foundation for spacetime theory (i.e., roughly, relativity) is a worthwile attempt for several reasons. One of these is that\nspacetime can be regarded as a foundation of physics since spacetime\nis the arena in which physical phenomena take place. Another reason for seeking a logical foundation for spacetime is that throughout\nits history, logic benefited the most from those applications of logic\nwhich were aiming at branches of learning going through a turmoil or\n\n\fFOL FOUNDATION OF RELATIVITY THEORIES\n\n3\n\na revolutionary phase, and at the same time being important for our\nunderstanding of the world [35]. As a quick glance to recent issues\nof, e.g., Scientific American can convince the reader, spacetime theory\nand relativity/cosmology certainly qualify. So we believe that it serves\nthe best interest of logic community to apply logic to spacetime theory, relativity, cosmology, and black hole physics. Indeed, logic can\nbenefit from such studies in many ways. As a bonus, as indicated in\n[14] or [38], spacetime theory can give a feedback to the foundation of\nmathematics itself.\nFor certain reasons, the foundation of mathematics has been carried through strictly within the framework of first-order logic (FOL).\nOne of these reasons is that staying inside FOL helps us to avoid tacit\nassumptions. Another reason is that FOL has a complete inference\nsystem while higher-order logic cannot have one by G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem, see for example, V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen [65, p.505]. For more\nmotivation for staying inside FOL as opposed to higher-order logic, see\nfor example, [1], [2, Appendix 1: \"Why exactly FOL\"], [6], [21], [48],\n[67]. The same reasons motivate the effort of keeping the foundation\nof spacetime and relativity theory inside FOL.\nThe interplay between logic and relativity theory goes back to around\n1920 and has been playing a non-negligible role in works of researchers\nlike Reichenbach, Carnap, Suppes, Ax, Szekeres, Malament, Walker,\nand of many other contemporaries. For more details, cf. e.g., [1]. Also,\nit is no coincidence that relativity was the main motivating example\nfor the logical positivists of the Vienna Circle.\nAxiomatizations of SR have been quite extensively studied in the\nliterature, see for example, the references of [1]. However, these works\nusually stop with a kind of representation theorem for their axiomatizations. As a contrast, what we call the foundation of relativity begins\nwith the axiomatization (and representation theorems), but the real\nwork and the real fun (the conceptual analysis) comes afterwards when\nwe investigate, e.g., what axioms are responsible for which statements,\nwhat happens if we change the axioms etc.\nWhile some FOL axiomatizations of the theory of inertial observers\nand for SR can be found in the literature ([6], [26], [1]), axiom systems-\nlet alone FOL axiom systems-for accelerated observers and for GR are\nnot too many in the literature (but cf. [44] for an exception).\nIn section 4, we recall a streamlined FOL axiomatization AccRel of\nSR extended with accelerated observers. In section 5, we take one step\ntoward GR and investigate an aspect of time warp, that is the effect\nof gravitation on clocks, in our FOL setting. There we use Einstein's\nequivalence principle to talk about gravitation and prove the gravitational time dilation effect, that is that \"gravity causes time to run\nslow\", from AccRel in more than one sense. See Theorems 5.1, 5.2 and\n5.3. We will also see that gravity can slow time down arbitrarily, see\n\n\fFOL FOUNDATION OF RELATIVITY THEORIES\n\n4\n\nTheorems 5.4, 5.5 and 5.6. Furthermore, we investigate the role of the\n\"direction\" and the \"magnitude\" of gravitation in gravitational time\ndilation, see Theorems 5.7 and 5.8. We note that the most exotic\nfeatures of black holes, wormholes and the like (mentioned in section 3\nbelow) can be traced back to this effect of time warp (to be analyzed\nin section 5).\n3. Intriguing features of GR spacetimes (challenges for\nthe logician)\nBoth SR and GR have many interesting consequences. Most of them\nshow that we have to refine our common sense concepts of space and\ntime. They are full of surprising predictions and paradoxes which seriously challenge our common sense picture of the world. But it is exactly\nthis negation of common sense which makes this area an attractive field\nto apply logic.\nGravitation has many surprising effects on time. The common name\nfor these effects is time warp.\nFor example, in the Schwarzschild spacetime, which is associated\nwith a non-rotating black hole (or star), we face one of the simplest\naspect of time warp called gravitational time dilation. There we see\nthat if we suspend an observer closer to the black hole and another\nobserver farther away from it, then the clock of the closer one will run\nslower than the clock of the one which is farther away. So in some\nsense we see that \"gravity causes time run slow\". There are places\nwhere this time warp effect becomes infinite, i.e. some clocks entirely\nstop ticking, i.e. freeze from the point of view of some other observers.\nMoreover, time and space may get interchanged. These effects are part\nof the reason why we said in section 1 that space does not exist while\nspacetime does.\nThe above-mentioned time warp effect leads to even stronger effects. We meet new interesting aspects of time warp in the Reissner \u2013 Nordstr\u00f6m, Kerr and Kerr \u2013 Newman spacetimes that are associated with charged, rotating and charged-rotating black holes, respectively. For astronomical evidence for the existence of rotating black\nholes cf. e.g., [49], [58]. In these spacetimes, there is an event whose\ncausal past contains timelike curves which are infinitely long in the\nfuture direction. Such a curve can be the life-line of an observer (or\ncomputer) who has infinite time for working and sending light-signals\nthat can be received before the distinguished event. The spacetimes\nin which these kinds of events occur are called Malament \u2013 Hogarth\nspacetimes, cf. e.g., Earman [15, \u00a74], [38]. In Malament \u2013 Hogarth\nspacetimes, we can design a computer that decides non-Turing computable sets, cf. e.g., [38], [16], [14], [19]. Thus inside these spacetimes,\nwe can decide whether an axiom system of set theory (for example\nZFC) is consistent or not. Therefore, in contrast with the consequence\n\n\fFOL FOUNDATION OF RELATIVITY THEORIES\n\n5\n\nof G\u00f6del's second incompleteness theorem, we can find out whether\nmathematics is consistent or not. For more detail on these kinds of\ncomputers in the physically reasonable Kerr spacetime, cf. e.g., [14],\n[19]. Recently, the acceleration of the expansion of the universe made\nanti-de-Sitter spacetimes very popular with cosmologists. These also\nhave the Malament-Hogarth property, hence are also suitable for harboring computers breaking the Turing barrier.\nThere are several models of GR in which there are so-called Closed\nTimelike Curves (CTC). Such are G\u00f6del's rotating universe [25], Kerr\nand Kerr \u2013 Newman spacetimes [47], Gott's spacetime [27], Tipler's rotating cylinder [64], van Stockum's spacetime [57], Taub-NUT spacetime [31], to mention only a few. Since timelike curves correspond to\npossible life-lines of observers, in these spacetimes an observer can go\nthrough the same event more than once. This situation can be interpreted as time travel. This leads to non-trivial philosophical problems,\nin analysing/understanding which the methods of logic can considerably help. We believe, currently logic is the discipline best positioned\nfor clarifying the apparent problems with CTC's, i.e. with time travel.\nNamely, the only problem with time travel is that it represents a kind\nof circularity, because of the following: a time traveler goes back into\nhis past, changes his past so as to prevent his own existence, but then\nwho went back into the past? etc. This circularity is not more vicious\nthan the Liar paradox or self-reference implemented e.g. in G\u00f6del's second incompleteness proof. Logic has been extremely successful in understanding and \"de-mistifying\" self-referential situations and the Liar\nparadox. Examples are provided by literature of G\u00f6del's incompleteness method [30], the book on \"The Liar\" by Barwise and Etchemendy\n[7] which used non-well-founded set theory for providing an explicit semantic analysis for self-referential situations, [55]. So logic seems to be\nbest suited for providing rational understanding of situations like the\ncircularity represented by CTC's or time travel. For more on CTC's,\ncf. e.g., [15, \u00a76], [17], [28].\nThese are only a few of the many examples that show that turning\nRelativity Theory into a real FOL theory, axiomatizing it and analyzing\nits logical structure seem to be a promising, worthwile undertaking.\nWhat could science gain from such a logical analysis of relativity\ntheory? Turning GR into a FOL theory will make it more flexible. By\nflexibility we mean that we can change some of the axioms whenever\nwe would like to change the theory, without having to re-build the\nwhole theory from scratch. By changing the axioms, we can control the\nchanges of theory better than by changing Einstein's field equations.\nThis might be useful when we would like to understand the connection\nof GR to other theories of gravitation like the Brans \u2013 Dicke theory,\ncf. [8], [9], [20]. This flexibility can also be useful when we would like\nto extend GR. We indeed would like to extend GR since we do not\n\n\fFOL FOUNDATION OF RELATIVITY THEORIES\n\n6\n\nhave a good theory of Quantum Gravity (QG) which is a common\nextension of the quantum theory and GR. Some eminent researchers of\nrelativity formulated an even more optimistic goal of searching for the\ngeometrization of all physical phenomena known today into a so-called\ntheory of everything (TOE). Of course, one wants both QG and TOE\nto be some kinds of extensions of GR.\nRecent astronomical observations provided strong evidence that the\nexpansion of our universe is accelerating. This discovery leads to many\nquestions and to the idea that the cosmological constant might be\nreplaced with a dynamical parameter, i.e. with a scalar field, called\nQuintessence or \"dark energy\" cf. e.g., [10],[13]. But this leads to a\nnew need for modifying or at least fine-tuning GR. This also shows the\nmerit of making GR more flexible by providing a FOL axiom system\nfor it.\nSo far we have talked mainly about the significance of the logical\nfoundation of GR, but the logical analysis of SR is also important since\nGR is built on SR. Moreover, there are other different relativity theories such as the Reichenbach \u2013 Gr\u00fcnbaum version, cf. [50], [51] and [29]\nor the Lorentz-Poincar\u00e9 version of special relativity cf. [41]. Their logical structures and connection with Einstein's relativity are also worth\nanalyzing in order to get a more refined understanding of relativity\ntheory. Our research group has done some work in this direction [2,\n\u00a74.5].\nIn the following sections we try to give a sample of the work done by\nour research group in Budapest in the direction of a FOL investigation\nof relativity theories (including GR).\n4. A FOL axiom system of SR extended with accelerated\nobservers\nHere we recall one of our axiom systems for SR extended with accelerated observers (hence extended with a handle on gravity). We try to\nbe as self contained as possible. First occurrences of concepts used in\nthis work are set in boldface to make them easier to find.\nThe motivation for our choice of vocabulary is summarized as follows. Here we deal with the kinematics of relativity only, that is we\ndeal with motion of bodies (or test-particles). We will represent motion\nas changing spatial location in time. To do so, we will have referenceframes for coordinatizing events and, for simplicity, we will associate\nreference-frames with special bodies which we will call observers. We\nvisualize an observer-as-a-body as \"sitting\" in the origin of the space\npart of its reference-frame, or equivalently, \"living\" on the time-axis of\nthe reference-frame. We will distinguish inertial observers from noninertial (accelerated) ones. There will be another special kind of bodies\nwhich we will call photons. For coordinatizing events, we will use an\narbitrary ordered field in place of the field of the real numbers. Thus\n\n\fFOL FOUNDATION OF RELATIVITY THEORIES\n\n7\n\nthe elements of this field will be the \"quantities\" which we will use for\nmarking time and space. Allowing arbitrary ordered fields in place of\nthe field of the reals increases flexibility of our theory and minimizes the\namount of our mathematical presuppositions, cf. e.g., Ax [6] for further\nmotivation in this direction. Similar remarks apply to our flexibility oriented decisions below, for example, keeping the dimension of spacetime\na variable. Using observers in place of coordinate systems or reference\nframes is only a matter of didactic convenience and visualization. Using observers (or coordinate systems, or reference-frames) instead of\na single observer-independent spacetime structure has many reasons.\nOne of them is that it helps us in weeding out unnecessary axioms\nfrom our theories; but we state and emphasize the equivalence/duality\nbetween observer-oriented and observer-independent approaches to relativity theory, cf. [42, \u00a74.5]. Motivated by the above, we now turn to\nfixing the first-order language of our axiom systems.\nWe fix a natural number d \u2265 2 for the dimension of spacetime. Our\nlanguage contains the following non-logical symbols:\n\u2022 unary relation symbols B (for Bodies), Ob (for Observers),\nIOb (for Inertial Observers), Ph (for Photons) and Q (for\nQuantities),\n\u2022 binary function symbols +, * and a binary relation symbol \u2264\n(for the field operations and the ordering on Q), and\n\u2022 a 2 + d-ary relation symbol W (for World-view relation).\nThe bodies will play the role of the \"main characters\" of our spacetime models and they will be \"observed\" (coordinatized using the quantities) by the observers. This observation will be coded by the worldview relation W. Our bodies and observers are basically the same as\nthe \"test particles\" and the \"reference-frames\", respectively, in some\nof the literature.\nWe read B(x), Ob(x), IOb(x), Ph(x) and Q(x) as \"x is a body\", \"x\nis an observer\", \"x is an inertial observer\", \"x is a photon\", \"x is a\nquantity\". We use the world-view relation W to talk about coordinatization, by reading W(x, y, z1 , . . . , zd ) as \"observer x observes (or sees)\nbody y at coordinate point hz1 , . . . , zd i\". This kind of observation has\nno connection with seeing via photons, it simply means coordinatization.\nB(x), Ob(x), IOb(x), Ph(x), Q(x), W(x, y, z1 , . . . , zd ), x = y and\nx \u2264 y are the so-called atomic formulas of our first-order language,\nwhere x, y, z1, . . . , zd can be arbitrary variables or terms built up from\nvariables by using the field-operations \"+\" and \"*\". The formulas\nof our first-order language are built up from these atomic formulas by\nusing the logical connectives not (\u00ac), and (\u2227), or (\u2228), implies (=\u21d2),\nif-and-only-if (\u21d0\u21d2) and the quantifiers exists x (\u2203x) and for all x (\u2200x)\nfor every variable x.\n\n\fFOL FOUNDATION OF RELATIVITY THEORIES\n\n8\n\nThe models of this language are of the form\nM = hU; B, Ob, IOb, Ph, Q, +, *, \u2264, Wi,\n\nwhere U is a nonempty set and B, Ob, IOb, Ph and Q are unary\nrelations on U, etc. A unary relation on U is just a subset of U. Thus\nwe use B, Ob etc. as sets as well, for example, we write m \u2208 Ob in\nplace of Ob(m).\nQd := Q \u00d7 . . . \u00d7 Q (d-times) is the set of all d-tuples of elements of\nQ. If ~p \u2208 Qd , then we assume that ~p = hp1 , . . . , pd i, i.e. pi \u2208 Q denotes\nthe i-th component of the d-tuple p~. We write W(m, b, p~ ) in place of\nW(m, b, p1 , . . . , pd ), and we write \u2200~p in place of \u2200p1 , . . . , pd etc.\nLet us begin formulating our axioms. We formulate each axiom\nat two levels. First we give an intuitive formulation, then we give\na precise formalization using our logical notation (which easily can\nbe translated into first-order formulas by substituting the definitions\ninto the formalizations). We aspire to formulate easily understandable\naxioms in FOL.\nThe first axiom expresses our very basic assumptions like: both photons and observers are bodies, inertial observers are also observers, etc.\nAxFrame: Ob \u222a Ph \u2286 B, IOb \u2286 Ob, U = B \u222a Q, B \u2229 Q = \u2205,\nW \u2286 Ob \u00d7 B \u00d7 Qd , + and * are binary operations on Q, \u2264 is a\nbinary relation on Q.\nTo be able to add, multiply and compare measurements of observers,\nwe put some algebraic structure on the set of quantities Q by the next\naxiom.\nAxEOF: A FOL axiom stating that the quantity part hQ; +, *, \u2264i\nis a Euclidean1 ordered field.\nFor the first-order definition of linearly ordered field, see for example,\nChang \u2013 Keisler [11].\nWe will\u221aneed some definitions to formulate our other axioms. Let\n0, 1, \u2212, /,\nbe the usual field operations which are definable from \"+\"\nand \"*\". We use the vector-space structure of Qd , i.e. if p~, ~q \u2208 Qd and\n\u03bb \u2208 Q, then ~p + ~q, \u2212~p, \u03bb~p \u2208 Qd ; and ~o := h0, . . . , 0i denotes the origin.\nQd is called the coordinate system and its elements are referred\nto as coordinate points. We use the notation p~s := hp2 , . . . , pd i for\nthe space component of p~ and pt := p1 for the time component\nof p~ \u2208 Qd . The event (the set of bodies) observed by observer m at\ncoordinate point p~ is:\nevm (~p ) := { b \u2208 B : W(m, b, p~ ) } .\n\nThe coordinate-domain of observer m is the set of coordinate points\nwhere m observes something:\n\b\nCdm := p~ \u2208 Qd : evm (~p ) 6= \u2205 .\n1That\n\nis a linearly ordered field in which positive elements have square roots.\n\n\fPSfrag replacements\ntrm (m)\nFOL FOUNDATION OF RELATIVITY THEORIES\n\n9\n\ntrm (ph)\ntrk (m)\n\ntrk (k)\n\nCdk\n\np~\nevk\nEv\ntrk (b)\n\nCrdk\n\n~o\nk\nfm\n\nEvk\ne = evm (~\np ) = evk (~q )\n\ntrm (k)\nCdm\n\nCrdm\n\nEvm\n\nq\n~\ntrk (ph)\nworld-view of k\nworld-view of m trm (b)\n\nevm\n\n~o\n\nFigure 1. Illustration for the basic definitions.\nNow we formulate our first axiom on observers. This natural axiom\ngoes back to Galileo Galilei and even to d'Oresme of around 1350, cf.\ne.g., [1, p.23, \u00a75]. It simply states that each observer thinks that he\nrests in the origin of the space part of his coordinate system.\nAxSelf \u2212 : An observer sees himself in an event iff the space component of the coordinate of this event is the origin.\n\u0001\n\u2200m \u2208 Ob \u2200~p \u2208 Cdm\nm \u2208 evm (~p ) \u21d0\u21d2 p~s = ~o .\nTo formulate our axiom about the constancy of the speed of photons,\nfor convenience, we choose 1 for this\u221aspeed. Below, the Euclideanlength of p~ \u2208 Qn is defined as |~p | := p21 + . . . + p2n , for any n \u2265 1.\nAxPh0 : For every inertial observer, there is a photon through two\ncoordinate points p~ and ~q iff the slope of ~p \u2212 ~q is 1:\n\u2200m \u2208 IOb \u2200~p, ~q \u2208 Qd |~ps \u2212 ~qs | = |pt \u2212 qt | \u21d0\u21d2\n\n\u0001\nPh \u2229 evm (~p ) \u2229 evm (~q ) 6= \u2205 .\n\nMotivations for this axiom can be found, for example, in [3], or in\nd'Inverno [12, \u00a72.6].\nThe set of events seen by observer m is:\nEvm := { evm (~p ) : ~p \u2208 Cdm } ,\n\n\fFOL FOUNDATION OF RELATIVITY THEORIES\n\n10\n\nand the set of all events is\nEv := { e \u2208 Evm : m \u2208 Ob } .\n\nWith the next axiom, we assume that every inertial observer sees\nthe same set of events.\nAxEv: Every inertial observer sees the same events:\n\u2200m, k \u2208 IOb Evm = Evk .\n\nOne can prove from AxPh0 and AxEOF that if m is an inertial observer and e \u2208 Evm , then there is a unique coordinate point p~ \u2208 Qd\nsuch that e = evm (~p ). We will denote this unique coordinate point\n~p \u2208 Qd by Crdm (e).\nConvention 4.1. Whenever we write \"Crdm(e)\", we mean that there\nis a unique ~q \u2208 Cdm such that evm (~q ) = e, and Crdm (e) denotes this\nunique ~q . That is, if we talk about the value Crdm(e), we postulate\nthat it exists and is unique (by the present convention).\nWe say that events e1 and e2 are simultaneous for observer m, in\nsymbols e1 \u223cm e2 , iff e1 and e2 have the same time-coordinate in m's\ncoordinate-domain, i.e. if Crdm (e1 )t = Crdm (e2 )t . To talk about time\ndifferences measured by observers, we use timem (e1 , e2 ) as an abbreviation for |Crdm (e1 )t \u2212 Crdm (e2 )t | and we call it the elapsed time\nbetween events e1 and e2 measured by observer m. We note that, if\nm \u2208 e1 \u2229 e2 , then timem (e1 , e2 ) is called the proper time measured by\nm between e1 and e2 , and e1 \u223cm e2 iff timem (e1 , e2 ) = 0. We use\ndistm (e1 , e2 ) as an abbreviation for |Crdm(e1 )s \u2212 Crdm (e2 )s | and we\ncall it the spatial distance of events e1 and e2 according to an observer m. We note that when we write distm (e1 , e2 ) or timem (e1 , e2 ), we\nassume that e1 and e2 have unique coordinates by Convention 4.1.\nAxSimDist: If events e1 and e2 are simultaneous for both inertial\nobservers m and k, then m and k agree on the spatial distance\nbetween e1 and e2 :\n\u2200m, k \u2208 IOb \u2200e1 , e2 \u2208 Evm\ne1 \u223cm e2 \u2227 e1 \u223ck e2 =\u21d2\n\u0001\ndistm (e1 , e2 ) = distk (e1 , e2 ) .\nLet us collect these axioms in an axiom system called SpecReld .\n\nSpecReld := {AxFrame, AxEOF, AxSelf \u2212 , AxPh0 , AxEv, AxSimDist}.\n\nNow for each natural number d \u2265 2, we have a FOL theory of SR.\nUsually we omit the dimension parameter d. From the few axioms introduced so far, we can deduce the most frequently quoted predictions,\ncalled paradigmatic effects, of SR: (i) \"moving clocks slow down\" (ii)\n\"moving meter-rods shrink\" (iii) \"moving pairs of clocks get out of synchronism\". For more detail, see for example, [1], [2], or [3]. Here we\nconcentrate on the behavior of clocks and indicate a connection with\nMinkowski geometry.\n\n\fFOL FOUNDATION OF RELATIVITY THEORIES\n\n11\n\nTheorem 4.2. Assume SpecReld , d \u2265 3. Then\n\ntimem (e1 , e2 )2 \u2212 distm (e1 , e2 )2 = timek (e1 , e2 )2 \u2212 distk (e1 , e2 )2\n\nfor any m, k \u2208 IOb and e1 , e2 \u2208 Evm .\n\nThe above theorem is the starting point for building Minkowski geometry, which is the \"geometrization\" of SR. It also indicates that time\nand space are intertwined in SR. Here we only concentrate on its corollary usually stated as \"moving clocks slow down\". Theorem 4.2 shows\nthat SpecRel is a good axiom system for SR if we restrict our interest\nto inertial motion.\nCorollary 4.3. (moving clocks slow down) Assume SpecReld , d \u2265 3.\nLet m, k \u2208 IOb, e1 , e2 \u2208 Evk , and assume k \u2208 e1 \u2229 e2 , distm (e1 , e2 ) 6= 0.\nThen\ntimem (e1 , e2 ) > timek (e1 , e2 ).\nIn the above corollary, a \"moving clock\" is represented by observer\nk, that he is moving relative to m is expressed by distm (e1 , e2 ) 6= 0,\nk \u2208 e1 \u2229e2 , and that k's time is slowing down relative to m's is expressed\nby timem (e1 , e2 ) > timek (e1 , e2 ). This \"clock slowing down\" effect is\nonly relative, i.e., \"clocks moving relative to m slow down relative to\nm\". But this relative effect leads to a new kind of gravitation-oriented\n\"absolute slowing time down\" effect, as our next theorem as well as the\nwhole of section 5 will show.\nTo extend SpecRel, we now formulate axioms about non-inertial observers. The non-inertial observers are called accelerated observers.\nNote that AxSelf \u2212 is the only axiom introduced so far that talks about\nnon-inertial observers, too. We assume the following very natural axiom for all observers.\nAxEv+ : Whenever an observer participates in an event, he also\nsees this event:\n\u0001\n\u2200m \u2208 Ob \u2200e \u2208 Ev\nm \u2208 e =\u21d2 e \u2208 Evm .\n\nThe set of positive elements of Q is denoted by Q+ := {x \u2208 Q : x > 0}.\nThe interval between x, y \u2208 Q is defined as (x, y) := {z \u2208 Q : x < z <\ny}. Let H \u2286 Q. We say that H is connected iff \u2200x, y \u2208 H (x, y) \u2286 H,\nand we say that H is open iff \u2200x \u2208 H \u2203\u03b5 \u2208 Q+ (x \u2212 \u03b5, x + \u03b5) \u2286 H.\nWe assume the following technical axiom:\nAxSelf + : The set of time-instances in which an observer is present\nin its own world-view is connected and open:\n\u2200m \u2208 Ob {pt : m \u2208 evm (~p )} is connected and open.\n\nTo connect the coordinate-domains of the accelerated and the inertial\nobservers, we are going to formulate the statement that at each moment\nof his life, each accelerated observer sees the nearby world for a short\nwhile as an inertial observer does. To formalize this, first we introduce\n\n\fFOL FOUNDATION OF RELATIVITY THEORIES\n\n12\n\nthe relation of being a co-moving observer. To do so, we define the\n(coordinate) neighborhood of event e with radius r \u2208 Q+ according\nto observer k as:\nBkr (e) := { p~ \u2208 Cdk : \u2203~q \u2208 Cdk\nBkr (e)\n\nevk (~q ) = e \u2227 |~p \u2212 ~q | < r } .\n\nWe note that\n= \u2205 if e 6\u2208 Evk by this definition. Observer m is a\nco-moving observer of observer k at event e, in symbols m \u227be k, iff\nthe following holds:\n\u2200\u03b5 \u2208 Q+ \u2203\u03b4 \u2208 Q+ \u2200~p \u2208 Bk\u03b4 (e)\n\n~p \u2212 Crdm(evk (~p )) \u2264 \u03b5|~p \u2212 Crdk (e)|.\n\nNote that Crdm (e) = Crdk (e) and thus also e \u2208 Evm if m \u227be k and\ne \u2208 Evk . Note also that m \u227be k for every observer m if e 6\u2208 Evk ,\nby definition. Behind the definition of the co-moving observers is the\nfollowing intuitive image: as we zoom into smaller and smaller neighborhoods of the coordinate point of the given event, the coordinatedomains of the two observers are more and more similar. This intuitive\npicture is symmetric while the co-moving relation \u227be is not. Thus we\nintroduce a symmetric version. We say that observers m and k are\nstrong co-moving observers at event e, in symbols m \u227a\n\u227be k, iff both\nm \u227be k and k \u227be m hold. The following axiom gives the promised\nconnection between the coordinate-domains of the inertial and the accelerated observers:\nAxAcc+ : At any event in which an observer sees himself, there is\na strong co-moving inertial observer.\n\u2200k \u2208 Ob \u2200e \u2208 Ev\n\n( k \u2208 e =\u21d2 \u2203m \u2208 IOb m \u227a\n\u227be k ).\n\nThe axioms introduced so far are not strong enough to prove properties of accelerated clocks like the Twin Paradox, cf. Theorems 3.5\nand 3.7 and Corollary 3.6 in [44]. The additional property we need\nis that every bounded non-empty subset of the quantity part has a\nsupremum. This is a second-order logic property (because it concerns\nall subsets) which we cannot use in a FOL axiom system. Instead, we\nwill use a kind of \"induction\" axiom schema. It will state that every\nnon-empty, bounded subset of the quantity part which can be defined\nby a FOL-formula using possibly the extra part of the model, e.g., using the world-view relation, has a supremum. To formulate this FOL\ninduction axiom schema, we need some more definitions.\nIf \u03c6 is a formula and x is a variable, then we say that x is a free\nvariable of \u03c6 iff x does not occur under the scope of either \u2203x or \u2200x.\nSometimes we introduce a formula \u03c6 as \u03c6(~x ), this means that all the\nfree variables of \u03c6 lie in ~x.\nIf \u03c6(x, y) is a formula and M = hU; . . .i is a model, then whether\n\u03c6 is true or false in M depends on how we associate elements of U to\nthe free variables x, y. When we associate a, b \u2208 U to x, y, respectively,\nthen \u03c6(a, b) denotes this truth-value, thus \u03c6(a, b) is either true or false\nin M. For example, if \u03c6 is x \u2264 y, then \u03c6(0, 1) is true while \u03c6(1, 0) is\n\n\fFOL FOUNDATION OF RELATIVITY THEORIES\n\n13\n\nfalse in any ordered field. A formula \u03c6 is said to be true in M if \u03c6 is\ntrue in M no matter how we associate elements to the free variables.\nWe say that a subset H of Q is (parametrically) definable by \u03c6(y, ~x )\niff there is ~a \u2208 U n such that H = {b \u2208 Q : \u03c6(b, ~a ) is true in M}. We\nsay that a subset of Q is definable iff it is definable by a FOL-formula.\nLet \u03c6(x, ~y ) be a FOL-formula of our language.\nAxSup\u03c6 : Every subset of Q definable by \u03c6(x, ~y ) has a supremum\nif it is non-empty and bounded.\nA FOL formula expressing AxSup\u03c6 can be found in [44]. Our axiom\nscheme IND below says that every non-empty bounded subset of Q that\nis definable in our language has a supremum:\nIND := { AxSup\u03c6 : \u03c6 is a FOL-formula of our language } .\n\nNote that IND is true in any model whose quantity part is the field of\nreal numbers. For more detail about IND cf. [44].\nLet us call the collection of the axioms introduced so far AccReld :\n\b\nAccReld := SpecReld \u222a AxEv+ , AxSelf + , AxAcc+ \u222a IND.\nThe so-called Twin Paradox is provable in AccRel, cf. [44], [61]. We\nnow formulate the Twin Paradox with our logical notation.\nThe set of events encountered by m \u2208 Ob between e1 , e2 \u2208 Ev\nis denoted as\nEvm (e1 , e2 ) := { e \u2208 Evm : m \u2208 e \u2227\nCrdm (e1 )t < Crdm (e)t < Crdm (e2 )t } .\n\nNow we can formulate the Twin Paradox in our FOL setting.\nTwP: Every inertial observer m measures more time than or equal\ntime as any other observer k between any two meeting events\ne1 and e2 ; and they measure the same time iff they have encountered the same events between e1 and e2 :\n\u0010\n\u2200e1 , e2 \u2208 Ev \u2200m \u2208 IOb \u2200k \u2208 Ob\nk, m \u2208 e1 \u2229 e2 =\u21d2\n\u0001\ntimem (e1 , e2 ) = timek (e1 , e2 ) \u21d0\u21d2 Evm (e1 , e2 ) = Evk (e1 , e2 )\n\u0011\n\u2227 timem (e1 , e2 ) \u2265 timek (e1 , e2 ) .\nThe following theorem states that the Twin Paradox is provable in\nAccReld if d \u2265 3.\nTheorem 4.4. AccReld |= TwP, if d \u2265 3.\nFor the proof of this theorem, cf. [44], [61].\nWe note that there are non-trivial models of AccRel. E.g., the construction in Misner \u2013 Thorne \u2013 Wheeler [46, \u00a76, especially pp. 172-173\nand \u00a713.6 on pp. 327-332] can be used for constructing models for\nAccRel.\n\n\fFOL FOUNDATION OF RELATIVITY THEORIES\n\n14\n\n5. One step toward GR (effect of gravitation on clocks)\nWe would like to investigate the effect of gravitation on clocks in our\nFOL setting. As a first step we prove theorems about the Gravitational\nTime Dilation that roughly says that \"gravitation makes time flow\nslower\", that is, the clocks in the bottom of a tower run slower than\nthe clocks in the top of the tower. We will use Einstein's equivalence\nprinciple to treat gravitation in AccRel. This principle says that a\nuniformly accelerated frame of reference is indistinguishable from a\nrest frame in a uniform gravitational field, cf. e.g., d'Inverno [12, \u00a79.4].\nSo instead of gravitation we will talk about acceleration and instead of\ntowers we will talk about spaceships. This way the Gravitational Time\nDilation will become the following statement: \"the time in the aft of an\naccelerated spaceship flows slower than in the front of the spaceship\".\nWe begin to formulate this statement in our FOL language.\nTo talk about spaceships, we will need a concept of distance between\nevents and observers. We have the following two natural candidates for\nthis:\n\u2022 Event e is at radar-distance \u03bb \u2208 Q+ from observer k iff there\nare events e1 and e2 and photons ph1 and ph2 such that k \u2208\ne1 \u2229 e2 , ph1 \u2208 e \u2229 e1 , ph2 \u2208 e \u2229 e2 and timek (e1 , e2 ) = 2\u03bb. Event\ne is at radar-distance 0 from observer k iff k \u2208 e. See (a) of\nFigure 2.\n\u2022 Event e is at Minkowski-distance \u03bb \u2208 Q from observer k iff\nthere is an event e\u2032 such that k \u2208 e\u2032 , e \u223cm e\u2032 and distm (e, e\u2032 ) = \u03bb\nfor every inertial co-moving observer m of k at e\u2032 .

For stating that the\nspaceship does not change its direction we introduce the following concept. We say that observers k and b are coplanar iff trm (k) \u222a trm (b)\nis a subset of a plane containing a line parallel with the time-axis, in\nthe coordinate system of an inertial observer m.\nWe now introduce two concepts for spaceships. Observers b, k and\nc form a radar-spaceship, in symbols > b, k, c rad , iff b, k and c are\ncoplanar and k thinks that b and c are at constant radar-distances\nfrom him. The definition of the Minkowski-spaceship, in symbols\n> b, k, c \u03bc , is analogous.\nWe say that event e1 (causally) precedes event e2 according to observer k iff Crdm (e1 )t \u2264 Crdm (e2 )t for all inertial co-moving observers\nm of k. In this case, we also say that e2 succeeds e1 according to k.\nWe need some concept for deciding which events happened at the\nsame time according to an accelerated observer. The following three\nnatural concepts offer themselves:\n\u2022 Events e and e\u2032 are radar-simultaneous for observer k, in\nsymbols e \u223crad\ne\u2032 , iff k \u2208 e and there are events e1 and e2\nk\nand photons ph1 and ph2 such that k \u2208 e1 \u2229 e2 , ph1 \u2208 e \u2229 e1 ,\nph2 \u2208 e \u2229 e2 and timek (e1 , e) = timek (e, e2 ) or there is an event\ne3 such that e \u223crad\ne3 and e3 \u223crad\ne\u2032 .

See (c) of Figure 3.\nWe note that, for inertial observers, the concepts of radar-simultaneity\nand Minkowski-simultaneity coincide with the concept of simultaneity\nintroduced on page 10.\nWe will distinguish the front and the aft of the spaceship by the\ndirection of the acceleration. Thus we need a concept for direction.\nWe say that the directions of p~ \u2208 Qd and ~q \u2208 Qd are the same,\n2Life-line\n\nis called world-line in some of the literature.\n\n\fPSfrag replacements\n\nFOL FOUNDATION OF RELATIVITY THEORIES\n\nph1\ne\u2032\n\n\u03bb\n\nph1\n\nph2\ne\n\n\u03bb\n\n(a)\n\nk\n\nk\n\ne\nph2\n\nm\n\nm\n\nk\n\ne1\n\n16\n\ne\n\ne2\n\ne2\n\ne1\n\ne2\n\ne1\n(c)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 3.

[44]. Thus the following definitions are also FOL ones:\nThe relative-velocity ~vmk of observer k according to observer m at\ninstant t \u2208 Q is the derivative of the life-curve of k according to m\nk \u2032\nk\nat t, i.e., ~vmk (t) = (T rm\n) (t) if t \u2208 Dom T rm\nand undefined otherwise.\nk\nThe relative-acceleration ~am of observer k according to observer m\nat instant t \u2208 Q is the derivative of the relative-velocity at t if it is\ndifferentiable at t and undefined otherwise.\nEvents e1 and e2 are called spacelike separated, in symbols e1 \u2261 s\ne2 , iff Crdm (e1 ) and Crdm (e2 ) can be connected by a line of slope less\nthan 1 for every inertial observer m, i.e., iff |(Crdm(e1 )\u2212Crdm (e2 ))s | >\n|(Crdm(e1 ) \u2212 Crdm (e2 ))t | for every inertial observer m.

Since the length\nis always non-negative, we can use the sign of \u03bc(~p ) to code (ii).\nThe acceleration of an observer k at instant t \u2208 Q is defined as\nthe Minkowski-length of the relative-acceleration seen by any inertial\nobserver m at t, that is:\n\u0001\nk\nak (t) := \u03bc ~am\n(t) .\nThe acceleration is a well defined concept since it is independent of the\nchoice of the inertial observer m.

We say\nthat observer b is approaching to (moving away from) observer k as\nseen by k with photons iff for all events ek and eb , if b \u2208 eb , k \u2208 ek and\n\u2032 \u2032\nek \u223cph\nk eb , then there is an event e such that k , b \u2208 e for all inertial comoving observers k \u2032 and b\u2032 of k and b at events ek and eb , respectively,\nand eb precedes (succeeds) ek according to k, cf.

Let b, k \u2208 Ob such that b\nand k are coplanar and the life-curve of k is continuously differentiable.\n(1) If b is approaching to k as seen by k with photons, then the\nclock of k runs slower than the clock of b as seen by k with\nphotons.\n\n\fFOL FOUNDATION OF RELATIVITY THEORIES\n\n19\n\n(2) If b is moving away from k as seen by k with photons, then\nthe clock of b runs slower than the clock of k as seen by k with\nphotons.\nNone of the axioms introduced so far require the existence of accelerated (non-inertial) observers. Our following axiom scheme says\nthat every definable timelike curve is the life-line of an observer. Since\nfrom AxSelf \u2212 , AxPh0 and AxEv it follows that the life-lines of inertial\nobservers are straight lines, cf. e.g., [1], [39], [40], this will ensure the\nexistence of many non-inertial observers.\nA differentiable function \u03b3 is called timelike curve iff the slope of\n\u2032\n\u03b3 (t) is less than 1 (i.e., |\u03b3 \u2032 (t))s | < |\u03b3 \u2032 (t))t |) for all t \u2208 Dom \u03b3 and\nDom \u03b3 is an open and connected subset of Q.

The following theorem\nshows that two observers, say m and k, can feel the same gravitation\nwhile the clock of k runs slower than the clock of m. Thus it is not the\n\"strength\" of the gravitation that makes \"time flow more slowly\".\n\n\fFOL FOUNDATION OF RELATIVITY THEORIES\n\n20\n\nTheorem 5.7. Assume AccReld , Ax\u2203Ob and d \u2265 3. There are uniformly accelerated observers m and k such that ak (t) = am (t) for all\nt \u2208 Q, but the clock of k runs slower than the clock of m as seen by both\nm and k with photons (or with radar or with Minkowski simultaneity).\nNow let us see what we can say about the role of the \"direction\" of\ngravitation. Being \"more down in a gravitational well\" becomes being\n\"behind\" if we translate it from the language of gravitation into the\nlanguage of acceleration. This can be formulated by our notation as\nfollows. We say that observer b is behind observer k iff\nk\n\u2200m \u2208 IOb \u2200t \u2208 Dom T rm\n\u2200~p, ~q \u2208 Cdm\n\np~ \u2208 trm (k) \u2227\n\nk\n~q \u2208 trm (b) \u2227 evm (~p ) \u223c\u03bck evm (~q ) \u2227 ~am\n(t) \u2191\u2191 (~p \u2212 ~q ).\n\nThe following theorem shows that if observer b is at a lower level in\nthe tower than observer k is, then his clock runs slower than the clock\nof k, as seen by k with radar.\nTheorem 5.8.

Let b, k \u2208 Ob such\nthat:\n(1) k is positively accelerated,\n(2) b and k are coplanar,\n(3) b is behind k.\nThen the clock of k runs slower than the clock of b, as seen by k with\nradar.\nThe proofs, along with more explanation and motivation, of the theorems presented in this section can be found in [45].\n6. Questions, suggestions for future research\n(1) We hope that the perspective outlined in sections 1-3, and the\ntechniques presented in sections 4-5, [44] already suggest a research\nproposal. Sections 4-5 cover only a small fragment of the research\nproposed in sections 1-3. So the proposal is: elaborate a larger part of\nthe perspective outlined in 1-3 in the style of sections 4-5 and [44].\n(2) The Introduction of [2] contains more ideas both on the general\nperspective (of applying logic to spacetime theory) and also more of\nthe long-distance goals. However, some of the present results were not\navailable when [2] was written, therefore that introduction does not\nreplace completely the present section.\n(3) In section 5 we started to elaborate a purely logical theory of the\neffects of gravitation on clocks. Elaborate this direction in more detail,\nand investigate more aspects of gravitation on clocks. E.g. assume\nwe bore a hole through the Earth from the North pole to the South\npole. Now put a clock into the middle of the Earth. It will levitate\n\"weightlessly\" in the middle. Put another clock to the surface of the\nEarth. It will be squeezed by gravity to the surface. Despite this,\n\n\fFOL FOUNDATION OF RELATIVITY THEORIES\n\n21\n\nthe clock levitating in the middle will run slower than the one on the\nsurface. A third clock high above in deep space will run even faster\n(than the one on the surface). Why? Find a logic style formulation of\nthe above (and prove it) in the manner of section 5.\n(4) Investigate/formulate further aspects of the effects of gravity on\ninstruments (like clocks, meter-rods). E.g. define the so-called gravitational force-field experienced by an accelerated observer (via acceleration, relative to the observer, of test particles dropped by the observer).\nStudy this force-field and connect this study with the investigations in\nsection 5. Try to make an integrated coherent picture of gravity, time\nwarp (clock behavior in gravitational fields), and gravitational force.\n(Remark: gravitational force is often suppressed in the literature because it is not \"absolute\", i.e. is not observer independent. All the\nsame, if we keep in mind that it is observer dependent, then it is a\nhelpful concept.) Imagine a long, accelerated spaceship. The gravitational force experienced in the aft of the ship will be greater than that\nin the front of the ship. Why?\n(5) Continuing in the spirit of sections 4-5, [44], and the above, elaborate a FOL theory of the spacetime of a Schwarzschild black hole [63].\nStreamline that theory, make it logically transparent and illuminating.\nApply conceptual analysis to the theory similar in spirit as conceptual\nanalysis of special relativity is started in [2],[1],[43]. Using the theory\nof accelerated observers and Einstein's equivalence principle, create a\nlogically convincing, illuminating theory of such black holes. In this\ndirection it might be helpful that the analogy between the world-view\nor reference frame of an accelerated spaceship and skyscrapers (towers)\non the event horizon of a black hole is described in detail in Rindler's\nrelativity book [52, \u00a712.4 \"The uniformly accelerated lattice\", pp.267272]. Figure 12.6 is especially useful therein. Also note how in Rindler's\narrangement of the skyscrapers above the black hole they are prevented\nfrom falling by rigid rods separating them (these rods provide the \"acceleration\" experienced by the inhabitants of the towers/spaceships).\nThese rods are called struts in [52, p.270, line 7 bottom up].\nSo, we suggest combining the presently started FOL theory of accelerated observers and of effects of gravity (acceleration) on instruments\nof observers with the just quoted part of Rindler's work in order to\nelaborate a FOL theory of the simplest kind of black holes. Of course,\nthe main point is that we are striving for a very special kind of illuminating (etc.) FOL theory (and not just any FOL theory describing a\nblack hole).\nWhen the above is done, we suggest applying re-coordinatization in\norder to obtain an Eddington-Finkelstein version of this FOL theory of\nthe black hole. This second (EF) version of the theory will also describe\nwhat the in-falling observer sees e.g. from inside the event horizon. For\nthe latter question we suggest assuming that the black hole is huge\n\n\fFOL FOUNDATION OF RELATIVITY THEORIES\n\n22\n\n(galactic size) so that enough stuff remains to be observed after falling\nthrough the event horizon.\n(6) After having streamlined, analyzed, simplified FOL theories of\nsimple (but huge) black holes, we propose turning to what we call\ndouble black holes or exotic black holes. Double black holes have two\nevent horizons, an outer one and an inner one. In theory and under\ncertain assumptions, a traveler might fall into the black hole, survive\nthis and may come out at some other point of spacetime (in our universe\nor in some other universe). So, some of these double black holes may be\nregarded kind of wormholes. Examples are spinning black holes (Kerr\nspacetime, Kerr-Newmann spacetime), and electrically charged black\nholes (Reissner-Nordstr\u00f6m spacetime) [63].\nThe task here is again to build up, streamline, and conceptually\nanalyse, simplify FOL theories for such double black holes. They offer\nlogically intriguing issues for the logician as indicated in section 3.\n(7) Besides the relatively simple kind of acceleration studied in sections 4-5, [44], rotation provides a kind of acceleration appearing in\nthe form of the centrifugal force. A further research task is to analyse via FOL the world-view represented by a rotating coordinate lattice (relative to the gyroscopes) and generally, the rotational spacetimes. An example for these is the slowly rotating black hole (Kerr\nspacedtime), other examples are G\u00f6del's rotating universe, Tipler van Stockum spacetime. In these spacetimes rotation leads to CTC's\nand to many other exotic effects like the so-called dragging of inertial frames or the drag effect. Finding out more about these is the\ntask of NASA's recent \"Probe B\". Here again a FOL theory of such\nspacetimes waits for the creation, conceptual analysis and detailed illuminating explanation of what happens and exactly why. A particular\nquestion waiting to be answered is to find out and analyse what the\ncommon features/mechanisms/principles of these rotating spacetimes\n(with CTC's) are. E.g., many features of the above mentioned three\nspacetimes coincide. Is this a coincidence or is there a more general\n\"theory of rotating spacetimes\" lurking in the background. For more\non this question we refer to [5]. In particular, we are looking for a\nlogical answer to the quasi-philosophical question: \"Exactly why and\nhow CTC's are generated in rotating black holes and in G\u00f6del's universe. Why do they counter-rotate with matter?\" (More on what we\ncall \"counter-rotation\" can be found in [5].)\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThanks go to Victor Pambuccian for many valuable conversations on\nthe subject, for reading an earlier version of this paper and for helpful\nsuggestions leading to the present version.\n\n\fFOL FOUNDATION OF RELATIVITY THEORIES\n\n23\n\nResearch supported by the Hungarian National Foundation for scientific research grant T43242 as well as by Bolyai Grant for Judit X.\nMadar\u00e1sz.\n\nReferences\n[1] H.
