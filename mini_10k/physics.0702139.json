INTRODUCTION\nThe first demonstration of optical bistability (OB) was reported by Gibbs in 19761 in a Na vapor\nand, since then, numerous other materials exhibiting the phenomenon have been studied,\nincluding Yb3+ doped glasses and crystals, and semiconductors.2-8 The mechanisms responsible\nfor nonlinearity in glasses and crystals are varied, with many requiring cryogenic temperatures\n(typically < 40 K) to maintain the necessary low atomic decay rates in Yb3+ dimer and monomer\nsystems.3 Alternative and more easily achievable mechanisms include photon avalanche and\nthermal avalanche,2,5 suggesting that a wider range of materials can exhibit OB at temperatures\napproaching room temperature and above. However, to the best of our knowledge, no evidence\nof OB through these mechanisms in this temperature range has yet been observed. Bistable\nsensitized luminescence in Er-Yb:CsCdBr3 was first shown by Redmond,3 and subsequently by\nR\u00f3denas in a Nd-Yb co-doped crystal.4 They also described chromatic switching in addition to\nthe more traditional intensity switching, though both mechanisms required temperatures below\nroom temperature. To date, OB has also been predicted and observed in Yb3+ doped oxide\ncrystals, Cr-doped LiSrGaF6 and LiSrAlF6 crystals,5 Sm3+ doped glass microspheres,6 and Tm3+Yb3+ co-doped glass. The later system exhibited multiple hysteresis loops in the fluorescence\nintensity at room temperature.7\nThe interest in studying micron-sized spherical cavities stems from the potential they\noffer as novel components for experiments ranging from the very applied realization of alloptical networks to fundamental quantum optics experiments, whereby the microspheres can be\nused as ultra-high Q cavities for measurements based on the principles of cavity quantum\nelectrodynamics.9 Such microcavities can be either active or passive depending on the material\nused. For example, a sphere doped with the triply-ionized rare earth ions, Er3+, can yield\nfluorescence emissions ranging from UV to IR through various upconversion mechanisms 10,11\n\n2\n\n\fdue to the close proximity of the numerous energy levels in the ion. On the other hand we have\npreviously shown12 that certain emissions from an erbium-doped, fluoride glass microcavity are\ncoincident with the resonance wavelengths of the D-2 transitions in caesium and rubidium atoms that are routinely used in atom optics experiments. Microcavities that exhibit optical\nbistability are interesting for generating optical switches for all-optical computing, and miniature\nC-band laser sources are important for telecommunications applications.13 These factors have\nresulted in significant research focusing on the characterization of microcavities in recent years.\nThe concept of an Er3+-Yb3+ co-doped glass laser was demonstrated14 in 1965 as a\nmeans of optimizing the Er3+ emission cross-section while simultaneously ensuring an optimum\nYb3+ absorption cross-section. This overlap alleviates the difficulty of trying to directly pump\nthe narrow Er3+ absorption band.15 Phosphate glass has been investigated as a host matrix for\nrare-earth ions due to its favorable properties, such as: (i) the possibility of obtaining large\ndopant concentrations (up to 1.8\u00d71021 ions/cm3 for Yb3+, and ~1019 ions/cm3 for Er3+) compared\nto silicate, borate and fluoride glasses, (ii) its large absorption band in the near-infrared region,\n(iii) its large emission cross-section at 1.5 \u03bcm, and (iv) the low back energy transfer from Er3+\nions to Yb3+ ions.16,17,18 The spectral characteristics are also especially beneficial for C-band\nlasing; the intermediate lasing level, 4I11/2, has a high non-radiative relaxation rate (< 1 \u03bcs\nlifetime, maximum phonon energy of 1300 cm-1) to the 4I13/2 level compared with silica\n(maximum phonon energy of 1190 cm-1), and the long lifetime of the 4I13/2 level of about 8.45 ms\nfacilitates population inversion and high gain.13\n\nThe larger phonon energy of phosphate glass\n\nhas a negative effect on the upconversion efficiency compared to fluoride glass (with a\nmaximum phonon energy of 600 cm-1). This, however, is counter-balanced by the large dopant\nconcentrations and wide absorption cross-section of the Yb3+ sensitizer. In addition, phosphate\n\n3\n\n\fglass has better optomechanical properties compared to other glasses used for OB, such as\nCsCdBr3.\nNumerous papers have reported the linear excitation power dependence of green and\nred upconversion processes in bulk Er3+-Yb3+ co-doped phosphate glass, waveguides and - to a\nlesser extent - microspheres.19,20 Here we report the first observation of chromatic and intensity\nOB in phosphate glass (Schott IOG-2) at room temperature. To our knowledge, simultaneous\nintensity OB for multiple emissions and chromatic OB has not previously been reported for a\nsingle material. We present experimental results on 1.56 \u03bcm lasing and propose suitable\nupconversion mechanisms for the three color emission. For clarity, our results are organized in\ntwo sections: fluorescence and lasing emissions are discussed in section III, and the results of the\nOB measurements are discussed in section IV.\n\nII. EXPERIMENT\nThe IOG-2 glass used is doped with 2wt% Er2O3 (1.7\u00d71020 ions/cm3) and co-doped with 3wt%\nYb2O3 (2.5\u00d71020 ions/cm3). We study lasing and upconversion fluorescent emissions following\nCW pumping with a tunable 980 nm laser-diode (spectral width ~ 1 nm). IOG-2 glass, with a\nlow glass transition temperature of around 700 K,16 is ideal for producing microspheres with\ndiameters of between 30-70 \u03bcm using a microwave plasma torch.20 A detailed description of the\nexperimental approach has been published elsewhere.21 Efficient coupling of the pump into the\nmicrosphere is attained by using adiabatically tapered fibers fabricated using a direct heating\ntechnique.22 We use 3 \u03bcm diameter, 980 nm SMF-28 in the experiment for studying the\nupconversion and lasing processes, and we use 1 \u03bcm diameter, 1550 nm SMF-28 in the OB\nexperiment. The transmission loss in the tapered SMF-28 fiber is typically less than 0.1 dB/cm.\nThe alignment of taper and microsphere is optimized by adjusting the relative positions of the\ntwo, whilst maximizing the 1550 nm emissions. These lasing emissions are monitored by\n4\n\n\fconnecting one end of the pump fiber taper to an optical spectrum analyzer. During alignment\nwe also monitor the transmission through the pump fiber and typically 10\u201315% of the pump light\nis coupled into the microsphere with the 1550 nm fiber taper and only about 1% with the 980 nm\nfiber taper. All upconversion fluorescence spectra were acquired by free space coupling into an\nOcean Optics 2000 spectrometer.\n3+\n\nIII. Lasing and Fluorescence in Er -Yb\n\n3+\n\nFigure 1 shows the presence of switching in the fluorescence spectrum of a 35 \u03bcm diameter\nsphere before and after the switching positions, and the inset shows efficient fluorescent\nupconversions ranging from violet to red wavelengths for a pump power of 8 mW. We note four\ndistinct emission bands corresponding to erbium transitions at 405 nm (2H9/2\u21924I15/2), 520 nm\n(2H11/2\u21924I15/2), 550 nm (4S3/2\u21924I15/2), and 660 nm (4F9/2\u21924I15/2). The red emission is stronger\nthan red emissions produced in other singly doped glasses investigated in our laboratory, such as\nEr:ZBLALiP and Er:ZBNA, due to the much larger Yb3+ absorption cross-section compared to\nEr3+. One would expect the slope of the fluorescence to exhibit a simple power law dependence,\na\nI emission \u221d I excitation\n, where a is the number of pump photons required to produce each emitted\n\nphoton, thus reflecting the multiphoton nature of the upconversion process. However, this law\nfails in the presence of OB, as will be explained in section IV.\nAnalysis of the whispering gallery modes in the IR fluorescence in the inset of Fig. 2\nenables us to measure the free spectral range, \u03bdFSR, of the sphere modes to be 1.32 THz (\u2261 10.4\nnm). This agrees closely with the calculated value of \u03bd FSR = c \u03c0ND \u2248 1.27 THz (\u2261 10.2 nm),\nindicating a microsphere diameter, D \u2248 48 \u03bcm. This has been confirmed with an optical\nmicroscope measurement of 50 \u00b1 2 \u03bcm. The refractive index of IOG-2 at room temperature is\n1.508 at 1540 nm. Eccentricity, \u03b5, in the microsphere results in splitting of the azimuthal modes,\n5\n\n\f\u2206\u03c9ecc, by about 15 GHz corresponding to an eccentricity of around 2.7% for l = m , calculated\n\n(\n\n)\n\nfrom \u03b5 = (\u2206\u03c9 ecc \u03c9 nml ) \u22c5 l 2 m \u2212 1 / 2 , where l and m are the angular mode numbers, and \u03c9nml is\nthe angular frequency of the mode. The measured spacing between TE and TM modes of 9.0 nm\naround 1550 nm agrees well with the calculated value of 8.5 nm. This microsphere has a peak\nlasing emission of 44 \u03bcW for a pump power of ~ 10 mW coupled into the fiber taper and, in\ngeneral, we record lasing thresholds of less than 1 mW.\nEnergy transfer from the 4F5/2 level in Yb3+ to the 4I11/2 level in Er3+ is only about 80%\nefficient, resulting in the remaining 20% being dissipated in the host matrix as heat.17 The 2H11/2\nlevel and the 4S3/2 level can be considered to be in quasi-thermal equilibrium since kBT \u2248 200\ncm-1 is comparable to the maximum phonon energy of 1300 cm-1 for phosphate glass.19 As such,\nonly one phonon is required to bridge the energy difference between the two green levels,\nthereby populating the 2H11/2 level at room temperature. The thermalization of the 2H11/2 level by\nthe 4S3/2 level has a temperature dependent effect on the ratio of the radiative emissions from\nthese two levels as well as the excited state lifetimes.23,24 The multi-phonon emission rate at a\ntemperature, T, is\n\n[\n\nK mp (T ) = K mp (0) 1 \u2212 e \u2212h\u03c9\n\n]\n\nk BT \u2212 p\n\n(1)\n\nwhere kB is Boltzmann's constant, \u03c9 is the phonon frequency, and p is the number of phonons\nrequired to bridge the energy gap, \u2206E, between the levels and is given by \u2206E / h\u03c9 , where \u045b\u03c9 is\nthe phonon energy.24 For phosphate glass, this emission rate is Kmp(295 K) \u2248 1011 s-1, which is\nsignificantly higher than the value of 108 s-1 reported for silica.25 The energy difference between\nthe 4S3/2 level and the next lowest level, 4F9/2, requires three phonons, therefore making this level\nfar less likely to be populated from the 4S3/2 level.\n\n6\n\n\fThe emissions detected from the IOG-2 microsphere are due to upconversion processes\ninvolving multiple pump laser photons and/or lattice phonons. Two upconversion mechanisms\nwhich must be considered when trying to understand the origin of the fluorescence results are\nexcited state absorption (ESA) and energy transfer upconversion (ETU).26,27 These are shown in\nthe energy level diagram in Fig. 3. The combination of reasonably high cavity quality factor\n(typically 2-5 \u00d7 104, measured as the FWHM of an individual 1.5 \u03bcm lasing peak and limited by\nthe resolution of the optical spectrum analyzer) and strongly localized electromagnetic field in\nthe form of a whispering gallery mode (mode volume ~ 3000 \u03bcm3) serves to significantly\nenhance the probability that an excited ion will absorb further pump photons. As mentioned,\nthere is a resonant energy transfer (ET) from the Yb3+ sensitizer (2F5/2\u21922F7/2) to the Er3+ ion\n(4I15/2\u21924I11/2) followed by ESA from the 4I11/2 level to the 4F7/2 level. However, rapid, nonradiative relaxation to the 4I13/2 level is also possible. In spite of a large energy mismatch of\nabout 1450 cm-1 for the 4I13/2\u21924F9/2 transition, the long lifetime of the 4I13/2 state and associated\nlarge population ensures that the ETU mechanism is adequately efficient.28,29 Due to the close\nspacing of the 4F7/2 and 4S3/2 levels, the population of 4F7/2 readily decays non-radiatively to the\n4\n\nS3/2 level, whereby the thermal mechanism described previously populates the 2H11/2 level.\n\nFinally, a second ESA from the 4S3/2 level up to the 2G7/2 level is followed by non-radiative\nrelaxation down to the 2H9/2 level and the subsequent radiative decay to the ground state\ngenerates a photon at 410 nm (violet).\nAt the high concentrations of Er3+ and Yb3+ in this work the inter-ion separation reaches\na critically small radius of ~ 3 nm for Er3+ ions and ~ 2 nm for Yb3+ ions. This is close to the\nvalue of 2.12 nm for Yb3+-Yb3+ ET's and an estimated 1.5-2.0 nm for Yb3+-Er3+ ET's as\ndetermined from F\u00f6rster-Dexter theory,30,31 dramatically enhancing the probability of Yb3+-Yb3+,\n\n7\n\n\fYb3+-Er3+ and, presumably, Er3+-Er3+ energy transfers. The critical radius, Rsx, is determined by\nthe overlap of the emission and absorption cross-sections and is given by\n6\nR sx\n=\n\n3c\u03c4 s\n8\u03c0 4 n 2\n\n\u222b \u03c3 ems (\u03bb )\u03c3 abs (\u03bb )d\u03bb\ns\n\nx\n\n(2)\n\nwhere c is the velocity of the photons, \u03c4s = 1.4 ms is the fluorescence decay time of the\nunperturbed sensitizer, n is the refractive index, \u03c3ems is the emission cross-section and \u03c3abs is the\nabsorption cross-section in Fig. 4, as calculated from absorbance measurements with a bulk\nsample of IOG-2. The script s stands for the sensitizer, i.e. the Yb3+ ions, and the script x stands\nfor either the sensitizer or the Er3+ acceptor ions. For non-radiative dipole-dipole interactions the\nenergy transfer rate rapidly increases according to the inverse of the ion separation to the sixth\npower.\nThe strength of the red emission cannot be wholly explained by multi-phonon relaxation\nfrom the 4S3/2 level to the 4F9/2 level, due to the low relaxation rate. Notwithstanding the ESA\nprocess already mentioned, two ETU cross-relaxation channels can explain the strength of the\nred emission relative to the green emissions.\n4\n\nThe first ETU is via\n\nI 15 / 2 ( B) + 4 F9 / 2 ( A) and the second channel is via\n\n2\n\n4\n\nI 11 / 2 ( B ) + 4 I 13 / 2 ( A) \u2192\n\nH 11 / 2 ( B ) + 4 I 11 / 2 ( A)\u2192 4 F9 / 2 ( B ) + 4 F9 / 2 ( A)\n\nwhere A and B denote the two erbium ions involved (Fig. 3). Therefore, ions are removed from\nthe green levels and transferred to the red 4F9/2 level.\n\nThe two possible cross-relaxation\n\nprocesses feeding the 4F9/2 level deplete the intermediate 4I11/2 level and the metastable 4I13/2\nlevel, thereby placing the 1.5 \u03bcm emission in competition with the red emission and the other\nupconversion processes. We find that the power of the red emission is, typically, twice as high\nin microspheres that exhibit no lasing (due to excessive inhomogeneities in the cavity) compared\nto those that exhibit lasing.\n\nIV. Optical Bistability\n8\n\n\fA. Switching Contrast\nA very promising feature of these microcavity resonators is the high contrast switching observed\nin the fluorescence emissions and, particularly, in the IR lasing; the ratio of the emissions before\nand after switching (c.f. Fig. 5) is 2.4 for the green, 1.8 for the red, and 11 for the IR emissions.\nThe violet emission is too weak to be considered in these measurements. As the pump power is\nincreased, the emissions intensities shown in Fig. 5 remained almost constant until some critical\npower was reached, beyond which a sudden and dramatic rise in emission intensity was\nobserved. The critical power depends on the taper-sphere coupling efficiency. Increasing the\npump power even further caused the emission to level out once more. A reduction in pump\npower clearly demonstrates a wide bistable region, where the emission can have two intensity\nvalues depending on the history of the input power. It should be noted that each graph in Fig. 5\nis taken for a different sphere and the switching occurs at a different input power for the three\nspheres.\nB. Temperature Measurements\nAs alluded to earlier, the strong temperature dependence in IOG-2 is due to the inefficiency of\nthe energy transfer from the Yb3+ sensitizer to the Er3+ acceptor. A sudden rapid rise in the 520\nnm (2H11/2) emission intensity as compared to the 550 nm (4S3/2) intensity was observed when the\npump power was increased above the upper switching position as shown in Fig. 1. As the pump\npower was reduced below the lower switching position, there was a sudden decrease in intensity\nratio. Boltzmann statistics can simply describe the strong thermal coupling between these levels,\nand can lead to this type of switching. The intensity ratio is a function of the internal cavity\ntemperature and is described as\nI ( 2 H 11 / 2 )\n4\n\nI ( S3/ 2 )\n\n=\n\n\u239b \u2206E\nrH g H h\u03c9 H\nexp\u239c\u239c\nrS g S h\u03c9 S\n\u239d k bT\n\n9\n\n\u239e\n\u239f'\n\u239f\n\u23a0\n\n(3)\n\n\fwhere I is the integrated emission intensity for a particular level, r is the total spontaneous\nemission rate, g is the (2J + 1) multiplicity (or degeneracy) of each manifold, \u045b\u03c9H (\u045b\u03c9S) is the\nenergy of level 2H11/2 (4S3/2), and \u2206E is the energy separation between the levels .24,25 According\nto eq. (3), as the temperature is increased, the 2H11/2 level is more efficiently populated and an\nincreasingly larger fraction of the 4S3/2 population is rapidly promoted to the upper level and,\nconsequently, the ratio of the emissions from the two states inverts so that the 2H11/2 emission\nbecomes stronger. This chromatic switching can yield intensity ratios of up 3.2 for the 520 nm\n(2H11/2) and 550 nm (4S3/2) emissions. According to eq. (3) this indicates a sphere temperature\njust below the glass transition value of 700 K. This temperature seems unreasonably high and\nthere was no evidence of thermal stresses, fracturing of the glass or other defects in the\nmicrosphere during these measurements.\nC. External Heating of the Microsphere\nThe temperature dependence of the OB was examined by placing a platinum heater and\nthermocouple close to the microsphere and heating it to around 345 K. The pump power\ntransmitted past the taper-sphere junction was recorded at the same time as the microsphere\nemissions, while cycling the pump power from low to high and back again. The nonlinear\nabsorption of the pump photons (c.f. Fig. 6) is synchronized with switching in the lasing and\nfluorescence emissions. Comparison of the two plots taken at room temperature and at 345 K\nshows that an increase in external temperature causes the upper knee at 17 mW input power to\nshift down to 13 mW, while the lower knee at 7 mW only shifts slightly to the right, thereby\nshortening the bistable region. The pump power was cycled at a slow rate of ~ 1 mW/min due to\nthe thermal response time of the microsphere.\nThe results presented here clearly show that IOG-2 microspheres exhibit bistable\nswitching behavior under vastly different conditions to those reported for silica and\n\n10\n\n\fsemiconductor cavities, whereby the Kerr effect or thermal broadening/narrowing of the\nresonance line, together with high Q-factors (Q>108) and a tunable, narrow linewidth laser,\nprovided the nonlinearity.32 Two significant differences are found in our experiments: we use\nmicrospheres with loaded cavity Q's typically in the range 2\u20135 \u00d7 104, and the pump laser has a\nlinewidth of 1 nm and is not locked to individual cavity resonances.\n\nAnother possible\n\nnonlinearity mechanism - the thermo-optic effect - was used to explain OB in a Si resonator;8\nhowever, this effect is twenty times smaller for the IOG-2 glass presented in this paper.\nWe propose that the OB effects observed here can be explained by the thermal avalanche\ntheory of Gamelin et al.2 This theory relies on nonlinear absorption in the Yb3+ ions with\nincreasing temperature and predicts bistable power absorbance in the microsphere as a function\nof pump power in the taper as shown in Fig. 6. Measurements of the dependence of the Yb3+\nabsorption coefficient would require it to be a nonlinear function of internal microsphere\ntemperature above 295 K. As phonons are released into the lattice from Yb3+ excited and ground\nstates, the temperature increases, thereby increasing absorbance and leading to a further increase\nin temperature. This cyclic process causes a thermal avalanche for high enough pump power.\nAnother possible explanation may be a nonlinear upconversion rate either for Yb3+-Yb3+, Yb3+Er3+ or Er3+-Er3+ energy transfers.33 This has been observed in high concentration Er3+ doped\nfibers, where the nonlinearity is dependent on population inversion of the lasing levels, and the\nsignal and emission rates. Temperature dependent effects in the upconversion fluorescence in\nEr-Yb Ga2S3:La2O3 chalcogenide glass and germanosilicate optical fibers have been attributed to\nan exponential increase in the Yb3+ absorption cross-section elsewhere.34 Apart from these\nobservations, Guillot-N\u00f6el et al.35 have described bistability in the regime of strong Yb3+-Yb3+\ncoupling, in which case cooperative luminescence would be expected. Unfortunately, we have\nnot been able to discount this effect. However, if it is present, the luminescence would likely be\n\n11\n\n\fvery weak compared to the single ion Er3+ transitions. It is reasonable to assume the back\ntransfer rate is negligible due to the high phonon energy of the host lattice, and is, therefore,\nunlikely to be the source of nonlinearity.\n\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated a multi-wavelength, upconversion, microsphere light\nsource with optical bistability and identified the Er3+ transitions and fluorescence mechanisms\ninvolved. Factors affecting the dynamics of visible fluorescence and C-band lasing emission\nhave been examined and show that the thermal properties of IOG-2 glass play an important role\nin the microsphere performance. Our calculations show that the close proximity of the ions in\nour glass greatly enhances the probability of sensitizer-sensitizer and sensitizer-acceptor energy\ntransfers.\nThe first observation of chromatic and intensity OB in phosphate glass (Schott IOG-2) at\nroom temperature is reported. These results show that there are two possible temperatures in the\nbistable region and it is also possible to have two emission intensities for the same excitation\npower. Chromatic bistability is dependent on the presence of intensity bistability due to the\nenergy coupling between the green emitting levels, 2H11/2 and 4S3/2. Therefore the switching\npositions are the same for both types of bistability. The OB shows high contrast switching ratios.\nThe intensity switching shows ratios of 2.4 for the green, 1.8 for the red fluorescence emissions,\nand 11 for the IR lasing, while the chromatic switching ratios (2H11/2/4S3/2) are as high as 3.2. We\nhave found that the switching position is dependent on the microsphere temperature. The\nimproved optomechanical properties of IOG-2 compared to other glasses used for OB, such as\nCsCdBr3, makes this glass appealing for all-optical logic elements in optical engineering\napplications.\n\n12\n\n\fA microcavity resonator offers substantial miniaturization, greatly reduces the power\nrequired for switching, and allows for all emissions to be easily fiber coupled.12,22 Consequently,\nsuch readily accessible optical switching features are important for applications in all-optical\ncomputing. Our observations may be tentatively explained in terms of a nonlinear, temperature\ndependent, absorption coefficient for the Yb3+ sensitizer ions. We are currently modeling our\ndata based on this assumption.\n\nVI. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis work is funded by Science Foundation Ireland under grant 02/IN1/128.\n\nThe authors\n\nacknowledge P.
