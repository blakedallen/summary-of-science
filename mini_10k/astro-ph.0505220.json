The\nsources and diffuse fluxes of UHE neutrinos are discussed. Much attention is given to comparison of the cascade\nand cosmic ray upper bounds for diffuse neutrino fluxes. Cosmogenic neutrinos and neutrinos from the mirror\nmater are considered as superGZK neutrinos.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nheavy DM particles.\nUsually neutrino radiation is accompanied by\nother types of HE radiations, most notably by HE\ngamma-radiation and cosmic rays (CR). There\nare, however, so called \"hidden sources\" where\nall accompanying radiations are strongly or almost absorbed. The examples of such objects are\nthe Sun and Earth, in center of which neutralinos annihilate. Another ideal example is given by\nmirror matter, where all mirror particles interact\nwith visible matter gravitationally, and only mirror neutrinos can oscillate into visible ones. The\nalmost \"hidden\" source is given by the Stecker\nmodel [1] of AGN, where UHE photons and protons are mostly absorbed or confined, and only\nHE neutrinos emerge from there. There are some\nother less exotic examples of astrophysical hidden\nsources [2].\n\nWith Baikal and AMANDA detectors UHE\nneutrino astronomy entered its first stage, which\nwill reach the decisive level with 1 km3 detector.\nSimultaneously, the first steps are made in building the detectors searching for superGZK neutrinos, i.e. those with energies above the GZK\ncutoff, EGZK \u223c 5 \u00d7 1019 eV. Radio-telescopes,\nsuch as RICE, GLUE and FORTE are already\nsearching for radio signal from neutrino-induced\nshowers in ice and in the moon. Atmospheric\nneutrino-induced showers can be observed from\nthe space as it is proposed in the EUSO project.\nNeutrino-induced horizontal atmospheric showers\ncan be observed by the Auger array, which is now\nin the data-collecting phase.\nProduction of UHE cosmic neutrinos\noccurs in pp and p\u03b3 collisions of UHE protons\nwith the target protons/nuclei and with target\nlow-energy photons. They can be also produced\nby annihilation of DM particles and by decays of\nsuperheavy particles. In all these cases neutrinos\nare mostly produced in the chain of pion decays,\nand hence neutrino astronomy is a search for locations of HE pion production.\n\nNeutrino detection\nincludes four remarkable reactions:\nMuon production \u03bd\u03bc + N \u2192 \u03bc+ all gives an excellent tool to search for the discrete sources, since\ndirections of UHE muon and neutrino coincide.\nResonant production of W-boson, \u03bd\u0304e + e \u2192\nW \u2212 \u2192 hadrons results in production of monoenergetic showers with energy E0 = m2W /2me =\n6.3 \u00d7 106 GeV. This reaction has a large crosssection.\nTau production in a detector, \u03bd\u03c4 + N \u2192 \u03c4 +\nhadrons, is characterised by time sequence of\nthree signals: a shower from prompt hadrons, the\nCherenkov light from \u03c4 and hadron shower from\n\u03c4 -decay. SuperGZK \u03bd\u03c4 are absorbed less in the\n\nUHE neutrino sources\ncan be subdivided into accelerator sources and\ntop-down sources, where neutrinos are produced\nin decays and annihilation of heavy particles. The\nexamples of such sources are given by annihilation\nof neutralinos in the Sun and Earth, by topological defects, which produce superheavy unstable\nparticles, and by decays of quasi-stable super-\n\n1\n\n\f2\nEarth due to regeneration: absorbed \u03bd\u03c4 is converted into \u03c4 , which decays producing \u03bd\u03c4 again.\nZ-bursts provide a signal from the space, caused\nby the resonant Z 0 production on DM neutrinos,\n\u03bd + \u03bd\u0304DM \u2192 Z 0 \u2192 hadrons. The energy of the\ndetected neutrino must be tremendous:\n\u0012\n\u0013\nm2\n0.23 eV\nE0 = Z = 1.7 \u00d7 1013\nGeV.\n(1)\n2m\u03bd\nm\u03bd\nNeutrino oscillations\nplay the essential role. The neutrino flavors \u03bd\u0304e\nand \u03bd\u03c4 are inefficiently produced in the accelerator sources. The flavor oscillation with probability\n1\nr\nP\u03bd\u03b1 \u2192\u03bd\u03b2 = sin2 2\u03b8 sin2\n,\n2\nL(E)\nand oscillation length L(E), given by\n\u0013 \u0012 \u22124 2 \u0013\n\u0012\n10 eV\nE\n4E\npc\n=\n25\nL(E) =\n\u2206m2\n1011 GeV\n\u2206m2\nare very efficient due to large mixing angles \u03b8\nand astrophysically very short oscillation lengths.\nIf initial flavor ratio is given by pion decays,\n\u03bde : \u03bd\u03bc : \u03bd\u03c4 = 1 : 2 : 0, the observed flavor ratio is \u03bde : \u03bd\u03bc : \u03bd\u03c4 = 1 : 1 : 1 (equipartion).\nHE neutrinos from early universe.\nOne might think (and many did think) that large\nneutrino fluxes can be produced at cosmological\nepochs with large red shift. This possibility is\ndisfavored [3] by absorption of HE neutrinos and\nby nucleosynthesis bound on their fluxes. Neutrinos are absorbed in \u03bd \u03bd\u0304 collisions with big-bang\nneutrinos and horizon of observation for neutrinos\nwith energy E\u03bd0 (at present) is given by redshift\n4\n\n\u22121/3\n\nzabs = 7.9 \u00d7 10 (E\u03bd0 /1 TeV)\n\nNeutrino fluxes produced at large z are strongly\nrestricted by production of D and 3 He at the\nepochs after Bing Bang Nucleosynthesis. Neutrinos cause e-m cascades and MeV photons from\nthese cascades produce D and 3 He in collisions\nwith 4 He nuclei:\n\u03bd + \u03bd\u0304DM \u2192 cascade \u2192 MeV photons \u2192\n\u03b3MeV +4 He \u21923He/D.\n\n2. Accelerator sources\nProtons are assumed to be accelerated mostly\nby the shocks and produce neutrinos in ppcollisions in gas and in p\u03b3 collisions in low-energy\nphoton background.\nHE neutrinos from AGN cores.\nThis case is known as the Stecker model [1]. The\nmassive black hole (BH) is surrounded by the\nthick accretion disc. The radial flow of accreting\ngas to BH is terminated by the shock at radial\ndistance rsh \u223c 10rg . The protons are accelerated diffusively at the shock, but they cannot diffuse upstream. As a result they are dragged by\ngas flow downstream and are absorbed by BH.\nNeutrinos are produced in p\u03b3-collisions with UV\nphotons of the disc radiation. HE gamma produced in the same p\u03b3-collisions are absorbed due\nto \u03b3 + \u03b3UV \u2192 e+ + e\u2212 . Neutrino flux from an individual AGN is not detectable, while the diffuse\nflux is detectable. In fact, the original prediction\nof the Stecker model is higher than upper limit of\nAMANDA, but diffuse flux in the Stecker model\ncan be easily suppressed by the choice of parameters, in particular by increasing of rsh .\nHE neutrinos from AGN jets [4].\nThe protons are accelerated in the multiple\nshocks in the AGN jets, especially in their inner parts. Neutrinos are produced in the collisions with photons from the accretion disc and\nfrom photons produced in the jet by accelerated\nelectrons and photons. Neutrino flux from individual AGN is very small, but the diffuse flux is\ndetectable by future 1 km3 detector.\nHE neutrinos from galaxy clusters [5].\nThe clusters of galaxies are able to keep UHE cosmic rays for a time exceeding the age of the universe. This is the key phenomenon which makes\ngalaxy clusters the powerful sources of UHE neutrinos. The particles are accelerated in clusters\nby various mechanisms: in the normal galaxies\nby SN shocks, in AGN and cD-galaxies, in the\nprocess of galactic merging. HE protons, confined in a cluster by intracluster magnetic fields,\nproduce the large flux of pp-neutrinos due to long\nconfinement time. The diffuse HE neutrino flux is\n\n\f3\ndetermined entirely by basic parameters characterising the clusters. In particular, for the lower\nlimit of the diffuse flux provided by normal galaxies with CR luminosity Lp and generation index\n\u03b3g , both taken as ones in our galaxy, the diffuse\nflux is given as\nJ\u03bd (E) \u221d Lp E \u2212\u03b3g\n\nNg\n3 \u03be\u03a9b \u03c1cr ,\nRcl\n\nwhere Rcl \u223c 2 Mpc is the virial radius of a cluster, Ng \u223c 100 is richness of a cluster, \u03c1cr is critical cosmological density, and \u03be\u03a9b is cosmological\nbaryonic density provided by clusters.\nGamma Ray Bursts.\nGRBs are most exiting sources of UHE neutrinos. There are two mechanisms of HE neutrino\ngeneration. In the first one [6] particles are accelerated by external shock and neutrinos are produced in p\u03b3 collisions with GRB photons behind\nthe shock. In the second mechanism [7] protons\nare accelerated by internal shocks. The shocks\ncollide and produce the turbulence with equipartion magnetic field. In such medium the Fermi II\nacceleration mechanism operates, the spectrum is\nassumed to be \u221d 1/E 2 . Neutrinos are produced\nin p\u03b3 collisions with GRB photons. All estimates\nare very transparent and follow from assumption\nthat the energy outputs in GRB photons, accelerated protons and produced neutrinos are about\nthe same: W\u03bd \u223c Wp \u223c WGRB . Then the total\nnumber of neutrinos with energy E per burst is\nN\u03bd (E) \u223c\n\nWGRB\nE \u22122 ,\nln Emax /Emin\n\nwhere Emin and Emax are minimum and maximum acceleration energy, respectively. Now one\ncan write the flux of neutrinos from a single GRB,\nexpressing it through neutrino fluence S\u03bd :\nF\u03bd\u03bc +\u03bd\u0304\u03bc (> E) =\n\n1\nS\u03bd\n.\n3 E ln(Emax /Emin )\n2\n\nmax\nFor S\u03bd \u2264 SGRB\n= 1 \u00d7 10\u22124 erg/cm , the number\nof muons per GRB burst in ICECUBE is N\u03bc <\n0.1 for E\u03bc \u2265 1 TeV.\nThe diffuse flux is estimated in identical way\nthrough the local neutrino emissivity L\u03bd (0) and\n\nevolutionary factor kevol\nJ\u03bd\u03bc +\u03bd\u0304\u03bc (E) =\n\nL\u03bd (0)\n1 cH0\u22121\nkevol ,\n2\n3 4\u03c0 E ln Emax /Emin\n\nwhere evolutionary factor is given by\nZ zmax\nfevol (z)\ndz\np\nkevol =\n.\n(1 + z)2 (1 + z)3 \u03a9m + \u039b\n0\n\nFor the evolutionary function fevol (z) we take the\ncase of strong star formation evolution from [8],\nwhich results in kevol = 7.0 as a maximum value.\nFor the emissivity we use\nL\u03bd (0) \u2264 LGRB (0) = 0.6 \u00d7 1043 erg/Mpc3 yr,\n\nwhere the local GRB emissivity is taken from\n[9]. As a result we obtain E 2 J\u03bd\u03bc +\u03bd\u0304\u03bc (E) = 3.9 \u00d7\n10\u221210 GeV/cm2 s sr, i.e. one order a magnitude\nlower than in [7] (see Fig. 2) (note that in [7]\nthe emissivity is by factor of 3 larger). Diffuse\nneutrino flux from GRBs can be only marginally\ndetected by ICECUBE , but time and position\ncorrelations with GRBs make reliable even 1 - 3\ndetected events.\n3. Non-accelerator neutrino sources\nThese sources include objects with annihilation\nof DM (the Sun, Earth, cores of the galaxies), objects with the decays of superheavy DM particles\n(galactic halos) and topological defects. In the\nlast two cases neutrinos are produced in the decays of superheavy particles with the masses up\nto MGUT \u223c 1016 GeV. A particle decays to virtual particles, partons, which are cascading due to\nQCD interaction, and at the confinement radius\ncascade partons are converted to hadrons, most\nof which are pions. Neutrinos are produced in\npion decays with spectrum which can be approximately described at highest energies as dE/E 2 .\nNeutralino annihilation in the Sun and Earth.\nNeutralino is the best motivated DM particle.\nCrossing the Sun or Earth neutralino can loose\nits energy in collisions with nuclei and diminish\nits velocity below the escape velocity. If it happens, the neutralino is gravitationally trapped in\n\n\f4\n\nFigure 1. Underground muon flux produced by\nneutralino annihilation in the Sun, from ref. [10].\nThe points correspond to different supersymmetric parameters, m\u03c7 is the neutralino mass. The\nupper curves give the upper limits from various experiments. Curve \"Sun background\" corresponds to the neutrino flux induced by CR interacting with the Sun matter. The region above\nthe curve 10 km2 yr is accessible for a detector\nwith the given exposure, e.g for the ICECUBE\ndetector.\nthe object, and loosing further their energies, neutralinos are accumulated in the center of a celestial body. Annihilating there they produce pions and then neutrinos. The process of annihilation strongly depends on neutralino mass and\ncomposition (mixture of basic fields: zino, bino\nand two higgsinos). Fig. 1 shows the neutrinoinduced underground muon flux from annihilation of neutralinos in the Sun. The Sun background is caused by neutrinos produced by cosmic rays bombarding the Sun.\nTopological defects (TDs) are produced in early\nuniverse due to symmetry breaking accompanied\nby the phase transitions. In many cases TDs\nbecome unstable and decompose to constituent\nfields, superheavy gauge and Higgs bosons (Xparticles), which then decay producing UHE neutrinos (see [11], and [12] for a review)\nMonopoles (M) are produced due to G \u2192 H \u00d7\nU (1) symmetry breaking. M M\u0304 annihilation can\n\nproduce QCD cascade and neutrinos. Scenarios with the free monopole annihilation and with\nthe bound M M\u0304 systems (monopolonia) are disfavored for production of large neutrino fluxes.\nOrdinary strings are produced by U (1) symmetry breaking. There are several mechanisms by\nwhich ordinary strings can produce HE neutrinos:\ncollapse of the string loops, self-intersection, annihilation of cusps, production and annihilation\nof tiny loops. In most cases produced neutrino\nfluxes are too small for detection.\nSuperconducting strings can be powerful sources\nof neutrinos. In a wide class of elementary particle models strings behave like superconducting\nwires. Moving though cosmic magnetic fields,\nsuch strings develop electric current. Superconducting strings produce superheavy X-particles,\nwhen electric current in the string reaches the\ncritical value. X-particles escape from a string\nand decay. This process is strongly enhanced\nnear the cusps, the peculiar points on a string,\nwhere the velocity of an oscillating string reaches\nthe speed of light. The cusp emission of superheavy X-particles provides a realistic source of\nUHE neutrinos.\nMonopoles connected by strings are produced in\nthe G \u2192 H \u00d7 U (1) \u2192 H \u00d7 Zn sequence of symmetry breaking. At the first symmetry breaking\nmonopoles are produced, at the second one each\nmonopole get attached to n strings. Monopoles\noscillate near the equilibrium positions, generating UHE gauge bosons with neutrinos produced\nat their decays.\nNecklaces correspond to the case above when\nn = 2, i.e. when each monopole is attached to\ntwo strings, and a loop reminds a necklace with\nmonopoles playing the role of beads. In the process of evolution the strings shrink due to gravitational radiation and M M\u0304 pairs in the necklace inevitably annihilate. This model is most plausible\nand well developed for UHE neutrino production.\n4. Diffuse fluxes and upper limits\nIn this section I will discuss the cascade and\ncosmic ray upper limits, and compare them with\nthe model calculations of diffuse fluxes from var-\n\n\f5\nious astrophysical sources.\n4.1. Cascade upper limit\nThe cascade upper limit on HE and UHE neutrino fluxes [13,2] is provided due to e-m cascades\ninitiated by HE photons or electrons which always accompany production of neutrinos. Colliding with the target low-energy photons, a primary\nphoton or electron produce e-m cascade due to reactions \u03b3 + \u03b3tar \u2192 e+ + e\u2212 , e + \u03b3tar \u2192 e\u2032 + \u03b3 \u2032 ,\netc. The standard case is given by production of\nHE neutrinos in extragalactic space, and the cascade develops due to collisions with CMB photons\n(\u03b3tar = \u03b3CMB ). In case neutrino production occurs in a galaxy, the accompanying photon can\neither freely escapes from a galaxy and produce\ncascade in extragalactic space, or produce cascade on the background radiation (e.g. infra-red)\ninside the galaxy. In the latter case the galaxy\nshould be transparent for the cascade photons in\nthe range 10 MeV - 100 GeV.\nThe spectrum of the cascade photons is calculated [13,2]: in low energy part it is \u221d E \u22123/2 , at\nhigh energies \u221d E \u22122 with a cutoff at some energy\n\u01eb\u03b3 . The energy of transition between two regimes\nis given approximately by \u01ebc \u2248 (\u01ebt /3)(\u01eb\u03b3 /me )2 ,\nwhere \u01ebt is the mean energy of the target photon. In case the cascade develops in extragalactic\nspace \u01ebt = 6.35 \u00d7 10\u22124 eV, \u01eb\u03b3 \u223c 100 GeV (absorption on optical radiation), and \u01ebc \u223c 8 MeV.\nThe cascade spectrum is very close to the EGRET\nobservations in the range 3 MeV - 100 GeV\n[14]. The observed energy density in this range\nis \u03c9EGRET \u2248 (2 \u2212 3) \u00d7 10\u22126 eV/cm3 . The upper\nlimit on HE neutrino flux J\u03bd (> E) (sum of all\nflavors) is given by chain of the following inequalities\nZ \u221e\nZ\n4\u03c0\n4\u03c0 \u221e\nE\nJ\u03bd (E)dE \u2261\nEJ\u03bd (E)dE >\n\u03c9cas >\nc E\nc\nE\n4\u03c0\nEJ\u03bd (> E),\nc\nwhich in terms of the differential neutrino spectrum J\u03bd (E) gives\nc\n\u03c9cas , with \u03c9cas < \u03c9EGRET\n(2)\nE 2 J\u03bd (E) <\n4\u03c0\nEq. (2) gives the rigorous upper limit on the\nneutrino flux. It is valid for neutrino production\n\nFigure 2. Cascade and CR upper limits. The\ngeneral cascade upper limit (2) is shown by line\n\"cascade \u03bd\u03bc \" with additional factor 1/3, E \u22122\ncascade upper limit is given by line \"cascade\n\u03bd\u03bc 1/E 2 \". \"BAIKAL \u03bde \" and \"AMANDA \u03bd\u03bc \"\nare for Baikal and AMANDA upper limits, respectively. The Waxman-Bahcall upper limits are\ngiven by WB lines with and without evolution.\nMannheim-Protheroe-Rachen limits are marked\nby MPR with the optical depth for neutrons:\n\u03c4n\u03b3 \u226b 1 and \u03c4n\u03b3 < 1. Atmospheric neutrinos\nare shown by the hatched diagonal strip.\nby HE protons, by TDs, by annihilation and\ndecays of superheavy particles, i.e. in all cases\nwhen neutrinos are produced through decay of\npions and kaons. It is valid for production of\nneutrinos in extragalactic space and in galaxies,\nif they are transparent for the cascade photons.\nIt holds for arbitrary neutrino spectrum falling\ndown with energy. If one assumes some specific\nshape of neutrino spectrum, the cascade limit becomes stronger. For E \u22122 generation spectrum\none immediately obtains\nE 2 Ji (E) \u2264\n\n\u03c9cas\n1 c\n,\n3 4\u03c0 ln(Emax /Emin )\n\n(3)\n\nwhere i = \u03bd\u03bc + \u03bd\u0304\u03bc or i = \u03bde + \u03bd\u0304e .\nAMANDA and Baikal collaborations in fact assume E \u22122 neutrino spectrum to obtain observational upper limits. In Fig. 2 we plot both the\n\n\f6\ngeneral cascade upper limit (2) and E \u22122 cascade upper limit (3), both for \u03bd\u03bc + \u03bd\u0304\u03bc neutrino\nflavors. For the E \u22122 cascade upper limit, the\nAMANDA-B10 parameters Emin = 6 TeV and\nEmax = 1000 TeV [15] are used. Baikal upper\nlimit is taken from [16].\nAMANDA and Baikal did not reach yet the cascade upper limit (see Fig. 2).\n4.2. Cosmic Ray (CR) upper limits\nCosmic rays leaking out of HE neutrino sources\nshould not exceed the observed flux: this is the\nessence of CR upper limits on the neutrino flux.\nThe Waxman-Bahcall upper limit[17].\nThe neutrino sources which produce UHECR\nwith energies 1019 \u2212 1021 eV are considered. It\nis assumed that neutrinos are produced by protons in p\u03b3 collisions in a source, and that protons\nare loosing the fraction of energy \u01eb < 1. The\ngeneration spectrum is assumed \u221d 1/E 2 . Escaping protons should not exceed the observed\nflux of UHECR and it imposes the upper limit\non neutrino flux. These upper limits are plotted\nin Fig. 2 by the WB lines for evolutionary and\nnon-evolutionary cases.\nNote, that this limit is not valid for sources\nwith maximum energy of accelerated protons\nEmax \u2264 1 \u00d7 1019 eV, for all sources where protons are confined (e.g. clusters of galaxies and the\nAGN core models [1]), and for all non-accelerator\nsources discussed above.\nThe Mannheim-Protheroe-Rachen upper limits.\nThe CR upper limit can be relaxed taking into account the absorption of HE protons in a source.\nIn the work [18] the exit of protons from a source\nis provided by production and escape of the neutrons with their consequent decays to the protons.\nThis upper limit is constructed mainly for AGN,\nassuming various optical depth \u03c4n\u03b3 for escaping\nprotons. In contrast to WB limit, the maximum\nenergy of accelerated protons is allowed in a wide\nrange 106 \u2212 3 \u00d7 1013 GeV. The upper bound on\nextragalactic proton flux for this energy interval\nis extracted from observations. The spectrum\nof accelerated protons is assumed \u221d 1/E 2 , but\nthe resulting proton spectrum at observation is\nevaluated. In Fig. 2 the MPR upper limits are\n\nFigure 3.\nDiffuse fluxes from AGN jets,\nGRBs and galaxy clusters, compared with upper\nbounds.\nshown for two extreme cases \u03c4n\u03b3 < 1 (neutron\ntransparent sources) and \u03c4n\u03b3 \u226b 1 (neutron nontransparent sources).\nCR upper limits are valid for AGN and GRBs.\nThey are not valid for TDs, annihilation and decay of DM particles and hidden sources [19]. They\nare also not valid for such conservative accelerator sources as galaxy clusters. Such long list of\nexclusions contradicts the standard definition of\nupper limit in physics. It deserves more the name\nlandmark for future HE neutrino detectors, especially in the case of the WB limit.\nIn Fig. 3 diffuse fluxes from AGN jets, GRBs\nand galaxy clusters are shown in comparison\nwith cascade upper limits and CR benchmarks.\nNote, that diffuse flux from galaxy clusters (the\ncase without evolution) exceeds the corresponding WB limit.\n5. SuperGZK neutrinos\nSoon after prediction of the GZK cutoff, it was\nnoticed that this phenomenon is accompanied by\na flux of extremely high energy neutrinos, which\nin some models exceeds the flux of parent protons\n[20]. For detection of these neutrinos the horizontal EAS have been proposed [13]. The boost to\nthis field has been recently given by the projects\n\n\f7\n-24\n\n25,5\n\nm=3\n\nsr\n\nAKENO\n\n-1\n\nm=0\np\n\n-1\n\ns\n-2\n\n-28\n\n-30\n\n24,0\n\n3\n\n23,5\ni\n\n23,0\n\n-32\n\n-34\n\nm=0\n-36\n\nm=3\n\n-38\n\n22,5\n\n-40\n\n22,0\n17,0\n\ni\n\n2\n\n2\n\nlog [ E J(E) eV m\n\nAGASA\n\np\n\n24,5\n\nlog(dJ(E)/dE) [(eV m s sr) ]\n\n-1\n\n]\n\n-26\n\n25,0\n\n= 2,4,5, 6\n\nz\n\nmax\n\nE\n\n= 1x10\n\nmax\n\n17,5\n\n18,0\n\n18,5\n\n19,0\n\n19,5\n\n20,0\n\n20,5\n\n21,0\n\n22\n\neV\n\n-42\n\nlog E/eV\n\nFigure 4.

Neutrino energy E\u03bd > 1 \u00d7 1020 eV implies proton\nenergy Ep \u223c 20E\u03bd > 2 \u00d7 1021 eV. Such energy\nis only marginally possible for non-relativistic\nshocks in AGN jets, and it is too high for ultrarelativistic shocks [24]. However, there are many\nproposals of plasma mechanisms of acceleration\nwith Emax much higher than 1 \u00d7 1021 eV, see\ne.g. [25]. One may optimistically expect that\nEmax \u223c 1 \u00d7 1022 eV is not the excluded possibility.\nTDs and SHDM particles naturally provides\nvery high energies up to EGUT \u223c 1016 GeV.\n5.1.

The term with\n\u03b1 in Eq.(4) takes into account the multiple collisions of proton with CMB photons, especially\nimportant in the evolutionary case. At low energies neutrino flux becomes flat. In evolutionary\nmodels the unmodified proton flux and neutrino\nflux can be much higher than UHECR flux calculated with all energy losses included. The recent calculations of cosmogenic neutrinos [26] use\nthe normalization to the observed UHECR flux.\nThe neutrino fluxes are small in non-evolutionary\nmodels with Emax \u2264 1 \u00d7 1021 eV and large in the\n\n\f8\n\nE 3 J (E ) (eV 2 m 2 s 1 sr\n\n1\n\n)\n\n1e+27\n\nMX = 1 \u0002 1014 GeV\n\n1e+26\n\np+\n\n1e+25\n1e+24\n1e+23\n\n\u0017\n\np\n\n1e+22\n1e+18\n\n1e+19\n\n1e+20\n\nE (eV)\n\n1e+21\n\n1e+22\n\nFigure 6. Diffuse neutrino spectrum from necklaces for MX = 1 \u00d7 1014 GeV [30]. The thick\ncurve gives p + \u03b3 flux normalized to the AGASA\ndata.\nmodels with strong cosmological evolutions and\nwith Emax \u2265 1 \u00d7 1022 eV. In Fig. 4 we present the\nneutrino flux produced in the non-evolutionary\nAGN model [27] with Emax = 1 \u00d7 1021 eV and\nwith generation spectrum index \u03b3g = 2.7. This\nmodel describes well the UHECR spectra observed by all existing detectors, except the highest energy AGASA events (see Fig. 4). The\ncalculated neutrino spectrum [28] gives the low\nlimit on the cosmogenic neutrino flux imposed\nby the observed flux of UHECR and assumption\nEmax \u2264 1 \u00d7 1021 eV. This flux is smaller than the\nlow limit found in the paper by Fodor et al [26]\nand is essentially undetectable. The large neutrino fluxes produced in the AGN models with\nEmax \u2264 1 \u00d7 1022 eV are shown in Fig. 5 [28]. The\ncalculated UHECR flux in all cases fits well the\nobservational data. Both the models with cosmological evolution (1 + z)m up to zmax , and\nnon-evolutionary models with m=0 were used.\nOne can notice that evolutionary models predicts\nmuch larger neutrino fluxes. They are detectable\nby future arrays.\nIn case the UHECR primaries are extragalactic nuclei, the flux of superGZK neutrinos is suppressed. The nuclei responsible for superGZK\n\nneutrinos are promptly photo-disintegrated to\nA nucleons, which produce neutrinos in photopion collisions. Thus, the energy of neutrino is\nE\u03bd \u223c (0.05/A)EN , where EN is an energy of\nnucleus. Putting E\u03bd /EN ratio in Eq. (4), and\ntaking into account 3A neutrinos produced by\none nucleus, we obtain the additional suppresunm\nsion of ratio J\u03bd (E)/JN\n(E) by factor A2\u2212\u03b3g . Besides, the energy of accelerated nucleus should be\nEN > 20A \u00d7 1020 eV, e.g. 1.1 \u00d7 1022 eV in case\nof iron.\nThe extragalactic nuclei as UHECR primaries\nhave another interesting aspect connected with\n< 1015 eV. In this\nneutrinos of lower energies E\u03bd \u223c\nenergy region the neutrino production is dominated by neutron decays with neutrons produced\nin photodissociation of UHE nuclei [29].\n5.2. Topological defects\nTDs as neutrino sources are described in Section 3. Neutrino fluxes from TDs are limited\nby the cascade upper limit (2). Usually it excludes too large masses of X-particles, in decays\nof which neutrinos are produced. The diffuse neutrino flux from necklaces has been calculated in\n[30]. The neutrino spectrum is shown in Fig. 6\nfor MX = 1 \u00d7 1014 GeV, allowed by the cascade\nupper limit (see Fig. 7). The spectrum is normalized to fit the AGASA data with help of protons\nand photons (p + \u03b3 curve). One can see that in\nsuperGZK region the neutrino flux is two orders\nof magnitude higher than p + \u03b3 flux. This model\nprovide much higher neutrino energies than that\nof cosmogenic neutrinos and much higher fluxes.\n5.3. Mirror neutrinos\nMirror matter can be most powerful source of\nsuperGZK neutrinos not limited by the usual cascade limit [34].\nExistence of mirror matter is based on the deep\ntheoretical concept, which was introduced by Lee\nand Yang [31], Landau [32] and most notably by\nKobzarev, Okun and Pomeranchuk [33]. Particle\nspace is a representation of the Poincare group.\nSince the space reflection ~x \u2192 \u2212~x and time shift\nt \u2192 t + \u2206t commute as the coordinate transformations, the corresponding inversion operator\nIs and the Hamiltonian H must commute, too:\n\n\f9\n\n6\n\nm\n\nLog (E 2 J\u0017 (E )=(eV\n\nGlue\n\n5\nRi e\n\n2\n\ns 1 sr 1 ))\n\n7\n\n4\n\nas ade\n\n3\n\nMX\n\n= 1014 GeV\n\nmirror\n\nForte\n\n2\nTD\n\n1\n\n0\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\nLog (E=eV)\n\nFigure 7. Diffuse flux of the visible neutrinos\nfrom mirror necklaces with MX = 1 \u00d7 1014 GeV.\nThe flux is limited by observations of RICE,\nGLUE and FORTE. Note, that neutrino flux exceeds the general cascade upper limit (2). TD\ncurve gives the flux from the ordinary necklaces.\n[Is , H] = 0. Because the parity operator P does\nnot commute with H (i.e. parity is not conserved)\nLee and Yang suggested that Is = P *R, where the\noperator R generates the mirror particle space,\nand thus Is transfers the left states of ordinary\nparticles into right states of the mirror particles\nand vise versa. In fact, the assumption of Landau\nis similar: one may say that he assumed R = C.\nThe mirror particles have interactions identical to the ordinary particles, but these two sectors interact with each other only gravitationally\n[33]. Gravitational interaction mixes the visible\nand mirror neutrino states, and thus causes the\noscillation between them. A cosmological scenario must provide the suppression of the mirror matter and in particular the density of mirror neutrinos at the epoch of nucleosynthesis. It\ncan be obtained in the two-inflaton model [34].\nThe rolling of two inlatons to minimum of the\npotential is not synchronised, and when the mirror inflaton reaches minimum, the ordinary inflaton continues its rolling, inflating thus the mirror\nmatter produced by the mirror inflaton. While\nmirror matter density is suppressed, the mirror\ntopological defects can strongly dominate [34].\n\nMirror TDs copiously produce mirror neutrinos\nwith extremely high energies typical for TDs, and\nthey are not accompanied by any visible particles.\nTherefore, the upper limits on HE mirror neutrinos in our world do not exist. All HE mirror particles produced by mirror TDs are sterile for us, interacting with ordinary matter only gravitationally, and only mirror neutrinos can be efficiently\nconverted into ordinary ones due to oscillations.\nThe only (weak) upper limit comes from the resonant interaction of converted neutrinos with DM\nneutrinos: \u03bd+\u03bd\u0304DM \u2192 Z 0 [34]. The strongest limit\non the fluxes of superGZK neutrinos are given\nby radio observations [22] and [23]. In Fig. 7 we\npresent the flux of visible neutrinos from the mirror necklaces with MX = 1 \u00d7 1014 GeV, limited\nby radio observations.\n6. Conclusions\nHigh energy neutrino astronomy with the future ice/underwater 1 km3 detectors will reach\nthe decisive stage in searching for neutrino\nsources and diffuse fluxes.\nAt present with AMANDA and Baikal the most\nrigorous cascade upper limit on the diffuse flux is\nalmost reached. To demonstrate existence of this\nlimit is an important goal, which will prove the\nabsence of exotic physics such as e.g. large diffuse\nfluxes from the hidden sources.\nDetection of accelerator sources (and/or diffuse\nfluxes from them) such as AGN and GRBs will\nclarify the nature of these sources and acceleration mechanisms.\nDetection of non-accelerator sources might result\nin discovery of \"new\" physics: (i) Supersymmetry\nand Dark matter in case of HE neutrinos from the\nSun and Earth, (ii) Topological Defects (diffuse\nflux is higher than CR upper limits or presence\nof neutrinos with energies E\u03bd > 1021 \u2212 1022 eV),\nand (iii) Mirror Matter (diffuse flux is higher than\ncascade upper limit.\nDetection of superGZK neutrinos will be the real\nbreak-through either in acceleration physics or in\nphysics beyond the Standard Model (Topological\nDefects, Superheavy Dark Matter, Mirror Matter).\n\n\f10\nREFERENCES\n1.
