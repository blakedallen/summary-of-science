Introduction\nAxions are hypothetical pseudo-scalar particles whose existence has been proposed as a solution to the so-called \"strong CP problem\" [1]. Today they constitute one of the most promising\ncandidates for the dark matter of the universe [2]. Recently their existence has been related with\na more general class of particles, the so-called \"axion-like particles\" (ALPs) [3],[4]. ALPs are\nscalar or pseudo-scalar particles of very low mass like the axions. Their coupling to photons is not\nconnected to their mass, as is the case for QCD-axions. Their origin may be either cosmological\nor astrophysical, mainly through photon-ALP conversion under the influence of strong electric and\nmagnetic fields. Cosmological ALPs are of very low mass and energy and they are considered to\nbe part of the cold dark matter in the cosmos [5],[2],[6]. The higher their mass the lower their\ncontribution in the dark matter content of the universe.\nALPs may be produced from photon conversion through the Primakoff effect [7]. This may\nhappen, when a photon flux crosses strong electric and magnetic fields. Such a case may exist in\nstellar interiors, where thermal photons are scattered under the influence of strong plasma fields.\nThe ALP flux expected from sun-like stars has been calculated and ALP spectra are given as a\nfunction of energy [3]. Photon-ALP conversion in large-scale magnetic fields and the existence of\nALPs which have a strong coupling to two photons have led to a series of publications in the last\ndecade investigating a number of interesting astrophysical consequences [8],[9],[10],[11],[12]. For\nexample, photon to ALP conversion might explain the dimming of distant very high energy gammaray sources [13],[14],[3] since it is expected that in the presence of magnetic fields at sufficiently\nlong distances, the conversion effect saturates and, in average, one third of high energy photons are\nconverted to ALPs [15]. The dimming of the light from distant supernovae has also been discussed\nin the context of photon-ALP conversion, as an alternative to the accelerated expansion of the\nuniverse [14],[16].\nIn the present work it is examined if these highly relativistic ALPs could constitute a measurable isotropic \"background\" for helioscope-type experiments, taking into account their sensitivity.\nWe also examine if some of these energetic ALPs could be detected using particle-physics detectors\nlike the ones in the ATLAS and CMS experiments at LHC.\n\n2. ALP-production in galaxies\nIt is interesting to consider the production of stellar ALPs in the Galaxy, as well as the ALP\nproduction in extragalactic powerful objects like AGNs and GRBs. In the next section we shall\nexamine the expected ALP fluxes on earth from these objects due to photon-ALP conversion in\ncosmic long-scale magnetic domains.\nThermal photons produced in the star interiors can be transformed into ALPs with the same\nenergy in the fluctuating electromagnetic fields of the stellar plasma. In the case of our sun, the\nsolar axion luminosity has been calculated [3]. The spectrum is continuous with the maximum of\nthe distribution at 3.0 keV and average energy of 4.2 keV . The integrated solar axion luminosity is:\n\u00012\n(2.1)\nL\u03b1 = g\u03b1\u03b3\u03b3 /10\u221210 GeV \u22121 \u00d7 1.85 \u00d7 10\u22123 LSUN\nTaking a solar X-ray luminosity of 1021 Js\u22121 and g\u03b1\u03b3\u03b3 \u2248 10\u221210 GeV \u22121 as representative values for\n1 \u2212 10 keV photons, we have a solar axion luminosity of the order 1018 Js\u22121 . Since in our Galaxy\n2\n\n\fAthanasios Manousos\n\nEnergetic axion-like particle production in galaxies\n\n1011 to 1012 stars exist, we can make the rough estimation that the ALP galactic stellar production\nin the 1 \u2212 10 keV region might be of the order 1030 Js\u22121 .\nALP luminosity of Active Galactic Nuclei can be estimated within the scenario that ALPs\ncan be produced in the accretion disk by the Compton, bremsstrahlung and Primakoff processes.\nFor bremsstrahlung which is the most efficient mechanism, this luminosity has been calculated\nand found to be of the order 1029 Js\u22121 [17]. Fairbairn et al. [18] have suggested that a flux of\nALPs on earth is expected coming from conversion of energetic gamma-rays emitted by astrophysical sources to ALPs in the magnetic fields of the sources themselves. In their work they\nestimate the contribution of various astrophysical sources to the ALP flux from photons with energies E > 10 keV (mainly pulsars and gamma-ray bursts). For other sources, like AGNs, there is\na contribution only at high energies (E > 10 MeV ) where the fluxes are considerably lower. The\nexpected flux of astrophysical ALPs is estimated to be of the order 10\u22123 cm\u22122 s\u22121 MeV \u22121 at about\n1 MeV , and 10\u22125 cm\u22122 s\u22121 MeV \u22121 at about 10 MeV [18]. The expected ALP flux is decreasing for\nhigher energies with a spectral index of about 2 - 2.3. Extrapolating, we can estimate a flux of\nabout 10\u22129 cm\u22122 s\u22121 MeV \u22121 at about 1 GeV .\n\n3. Photon to ALP conversion in cosmic magnetic domains\nIn the presence of large-scale magnetic fields, photons could convert to ALPs and vice versa.\nThis ALP-photon oscillation could give rise to a flux of energetic ALPs. The mixing depends on\nthe photon energy E and a number of other independent parameters like the plasma frequency of\nthe propagating medium, the ALP rest mass and the characteristics of the intergalactic magnetic\ndomains. The most interesting case is the possibility of strong mixing between photons and ALPs\nin which the effect is enhanced and saturates after traversing large intergalactic distances.\nThe dependence of the probability of the ALP-photon mixing on the energy, P = P (E) [15],[19],\ncan be written as:\ngBL\nP (E) = A (E) sin2 ( p\n)\n(3.1)\n2 A (E)\nwhere B and L are the mean magnetic field and the characteristic length, respectively, in the cos2\nmic magnetic regions, g is the photon-ALP coupling constant, and A (E) = E 2E+E 2 \u2208 (0, 1), is a\nc\nfactor depending on the energy E of the particle and a characteristic energy scale Ec determined\nby parameters like the ALP effective mass, the photon-ALP coupling strength, etc. For the behaviour of the above probability (3.1) an example is given in Figure 1. For energies E/Ec > 10 the\nmixing is relatively strong and independent on the photon energy. Burrage, Davis and Shaw [15]\nestimate that mixing is most significant for X and \u03b3-rays since the strong mixing limit is reached\nwhen E \u2265 0.3 \u2212 3 keV . Also, they expect that one third of the gamma-ray photons on average are\nconverted to ALPs when a variety of photons paths cross a large number of randomly oriented\nmagnetic regions.\nHere, we shall focus on the so-called \"extragalactic diffuse \u03b3-ray background\" (EGB) [20],[21]\nand the extraction of an associated ALP flux. The Fermi LAT Collaboration found that the spectrum\nof the EGB is consistent with a power law with a differential spectral index of 2.4 and intensity\n(for E > 100MeV ) 10\u22125 cm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121 . Assuming that the observed EGB-spectrum is what remains\nfrom an initial photon flux after its transformation by one third into an ALP-flux, we estimate that\n3\n\n\fAthanasios Manousos\n\nEnergetic axion-like particle production in galaxies\n\n0 .8\n0 .7\n0 .6\n\nP (E )\n\n0 .5\n0 .4\n0 .3\n0 .2\n0 .1\n0 .0\n1\n\n1 0\n\nE / E\n\n1 0 0\n\nc\n\nFigure 1: Dependence of the ALP-photon mixing probability on the energy (E/Ec )\n\n1 0\n\n-5\n\n1 0\n\n-6\n\n1 0\n\n-7\n\n1 0\n\n-8\n\n1 0\n\n-9\n\nF lu x ( c m\n\n-2\n\ns\n\n-1\n\n-1\n\ns r )\n\nan \"extragalactic diffuse ALP emission\" exists, with intensity 5 \u00d7 10\u22126 cm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121 for energies\nabove 100 MeV . The ALP spectrum is expected to be similar to the gamma ray spectrum, since the\nALP-photon mixing probability is independent on the energy above the strong mixing limit (E >\n10Ec ). The characteristic energy Ec can take values in a very broad range of energies depending\non the assumptions [6],[10],[11],[12],[15]. For ultralight ALPs (ma \u2248 10\u221211 eV ), it could be in the\nMeV region for typical astrophysical parameter values. This assumption is optimistic of course, but\nit introduces a bound in the flux that one would expect as an \"ALP-background\" in axion searches\n(Figure 2).\n\n1 0\n\n-1 0\n\n1 0\n\n-1 1\n\n1 0\n\n-1 2\n\n1 0\n\n-1 3\n\n1\n\n1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nE (G e V )\n\nFigure 2: Estimated flux of the extragalactic diffuse ALP background.

The energetic \"ALP-background\" in axionscopes and in big particle detectors\nAs mentioned in the previous two sections, the energetic (E > 1 MeV ) ALP production in\nthe Galaxy is expected to produce a flux lower or, in the best case, of the same order as the flux\nfrom photon - ALP conversion in the intergalactic magnetic fields. The point now is to find a way\nto check the hypothesis for diffuse energetic ALP flux, by exploiting existing detector equipment.\nHelioscopes like CAST [22],[23],[24] and the Tokyo Axion Helioscope [25],[26],[27] are designed\nfor detecting solar axions mainly in the energy range up to 100 keV . CAST experiment has also\nperformed measurements in the energy range up to 70 MeV , searching for solar axion emission\nlines from nuclear M1 transitions [28]. The background in CAST's low-background gamma-ray\ncalorimeter was of the order 10\u22123 to 10\u22124 cm\u22122 s\u22121 in the energy range 0.3 to 70 MeV , while no\nexcess signal found above background at 0.478 MeV and 5.5 MeV axion lines. On the other hand,\nthere is the possibility for terrestrial ALP production (\"geo-axions\") due to nuclear disintegrations\nof natural radionuclides in Earth's interior [29]. An optimistic estimate of their flux on Earth's surface give about 10\u22121 cm\u22122 s\u22121 which is not detectable by axionscopes. Since the expected solar ALP\nsignal is of many orders of magnitude stronger than that from diffuse energetic ALP-background,\nthere is no chance for the later to be detected in such experiments.\nIt is interesting to examine also the possibility for detecting a potential signal from diffuse\nenergetic ALP flux, by exploiting existing detector equipment of the big detector systems of nowadays, such as ATLAS [30] and CMS [31]. The equipment which is most promising for detection\nof single photon events at energies above 10 GeV is the superconducting solenoids of these multipurpose detectors with their meter-scale size and Tesla-scale magnetic fields. A high energy cosmic\nALP crossing the ATLAS solenoid encounters a magnetic field of 2 Tesla. The ALP direction has\nin general a component vertical to the direction of the magnetic field. This condition applies also\nfor some areas of the toroidal magnet system. On the other hand, in CMS the solenoid is bigger,\n14 meters in diameter, and the magnetic field is stronger, i.e. 4 Tesla.\nWith an ALP flux of 10\u221210 cm\u22122 s\u22121 , a number of 10\u22124 s\u22121 is reasonable to cross the solenoid\n(or 10 ALPs per day) at energies above 10 GeV . The probability of producing a photon from an\nenergetic ALP [32] entering a magnetic field with the above characteristics can be in the best case\nof the order 10\u221218 . Thus, the expected count-rate due to the above ALP flux is estimated to be less\nthan 10\u221214 counts per year. Obviously, it is not possible to detect an ALP signal also in LHC large\ndetector systems.\n\nReferences\n[1] J. E. Kim and G. Carosi, Axions and the strong CP problem, Rev. Mod.
