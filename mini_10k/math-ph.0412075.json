Cartan in 1913 wrote a treaty about\nspinors [2], after he has originally discovered them as entities that carry representations of the rotation groups associated to finite-dimensional vector spaces. He was\ninvestigating linear representations of simple groups. On the other hand, spinors\nwere introduced in physics in order to describe the wave function of quantum systems\nwith spin. W. Pauli, in 1926, described the electron wave function with spin by a\n2-component spinor in his non-relativistic theory [3]. After, in 1928, P. A. M. Dirac\nused a 4-component spinor to investigate the relativistic quantum mechanics formalism [4]. With the increasing use of spinors in physical theories, L. Infeld and B. L van\nder Waerden [5] wrote a treaty, but their formalism is not so simple for an undergraduate student in mathematics, or physics, to learn. In physical theories, spinors are\nfundamental entities describing matter, constituted by leptons and quarks, since they\nare spin 1/2 fermions [6] naturally described by Dirac spinors1 . From the algebraic\nviewpoint, spinors are elements of a lateral minimal ideal of a Clifford algebra. This\nwas introduced by C. Chevalley [7].\nThe main aim of this paper is to formulate the paravector model of spacetime, using\nalgebraic Weyl spinors, and to describe Weyl spinors in the Clifford algebras Cl3,0 and\nCl0,3 . Consequently Dirac spinors are naturally introduced, together with (algebraic)\nPauli spinors2 . This paper is organized as follows: In Sec. 1, we present some brief\nmathematical preliminaries concerning Clifford algebras. In Sec. 2 contravariant and\ncovariant, dotted and undotted Weyl spinors are introduced in Cl3,0 , together with the\nspinorial transformations associated to each one of them. In this way, Dirac spinors\nare naturally presented as elements of the Clifford algebra Cl3,0 over R3 . In Sec. 3 the\nDirac-Hestenes equation (DHE) in Cl3,0 is introduced. DHE is written as two coupled\nWeyl equations, using Weyl spinors, and alternatively, using Pauli spinors. The null\ntetrad in spacetime is introduced, using Weyl spinors to construct the paravector\nmodel of spacetime. In Sec. 4 we construct contravariant and covariant (Weyl) dotted\nspinors in Cl0,3 \u2243 H \u2295 H and define an application that maps Cl+\n0,3 , viewed as a right\nmodule (over the quaternion ring H) onto Cl+\n,\nbut\nnow\nviewed\nas a left H-module.\n0,3\n\n1\n\nPreliminaries\n\nLet V be a finite n-dimensional real vector space. We consider the tensor algebra\nL\u221e i\nLn\nk\ni=0 T (V ) from which we restrict our attention to the space \u039b(V ) :=\nk=0 \u039b (V )\nk\nof multivectors over V (\u039b (V ) denotes the space of the antisymmetric k-tensors).\nThe reversion of \u03c8 \u2208 \u039b(V ), denoted by \u03c8\u0303, is an algebra antiautomorphism given\nby \u03c8\u0303 = (\u22121)[k/2] \u03c8 ([k] denotes the integer part of k) while the main automorphism\nor graded involution 3 of \u03c8, denoted by \u03c8\u0302 , is an algebra automorphism given by\n\u03c8\u0302 = (\u22121)k \u03c8. The conjugation, denoted by \u03c8, is defined to be the reversion followed by\nthe main automorphism. If V is endowed with a non-degenerate, symmetric, bilinear\nmap g : V \u00d7 V \u2192 R, it is possible to extend g to \u039b(V ). Given \u03c8 = u1 \u2227 * * * \u2227 uk and\n1\n\nDirac spinors are defined as the sum of two elements, called Weyl spinors, that respectively carry two\nnon-equivalent representations of the group SL(2,C).\n2\nPauli spinors are elements of the representation space of the group SU(2).\n3\nOr parity operator.\n\n\f\u03c6 = v1 \u2227* * *\u2227vl , ui , vj \u2208 V , one defines g(\u03c8, \u03c6) = det(g(ui , vj )) if k = l, and g(\u03c8, \u03c6) = 0\nif k 6= l. Finally, the projection of a multivector \u03c8 = \u03c80 + \u03c81 + * * * + \u03c8n , \u03c8k \u2208 \u039bk (V ),\non its p-vector part is given by h\u03c8ip := \u03c8p . The Clifford product between v \u2208 V and\n\u03c8 \u2208 \u039b(V ) is given by v\u03c8 = v \u2227 \u03c8 + v * \u03c8. The Grassmann algebra (\u039b(V ), g) endowed\nwith this product is denoted by Cl(V, g) or Clp,q , the Clifford algebra associated to\nV \u2243 Rp,q , p + q = n.\n\nWeyl spinors in Cl3,0\n\n2\n\nIn this section Weyl spinors and spinorial metrics are constructed.\n\n2.1\n\nWeyl spinors and spinor metrics\n\nLet {e1 , e2 , e3 } be an orthonormal basis of R3 . The Clifford algebra Cl3,0 is generated by {1, e1 , e2 , e3 }, such that\n2g(ei , ej ) = 2\u03b4ij = (ei ej + ej ei ),\n\ni, j = 1, 2, 3.\n\n(1)\n\nAn arbitrary element of Cl3,0 can be written as\n\u03c8 = s + a1 e1 + a2 e2 + a3 e3 + b12 e12 + b13 e13 + b23 e23 + p e123 ,\n\ns, ai , bij , p \u2208 R. (2)\n\nLet f\u00b1 = 21 (1\u00b1e3 ) be primitive idempotents of Cl3,0 , clearly satisfying the relations\n2\nf+ f\u2212 = f\u2212 f+ = 0 and f\u00b1\n= f\u00b1 . The matrix representation\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n0 1\n0 0\n0 0\n1 0\n(3)\n, e1 f\u2212 =\n, e1 f + =\n, f\u2212 =\nf+ =\n0 0\n1 0\n0 1\n0 0\nis used heretofore. Each one of the four elements above generates a (left or right)\nminimal ideal.\nThe isomorphism\nCl3,0 f+ \u2243 Cl+\n(4)\n3,0 f+\nis not difficult to see, since\nCl+\n3,0 f+ \u220b \u03c6+ f+\n\n=\n=\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0012\n\nw1\nw2\nw1\nw2\n\n\u0013\n\u2212w2\u2217\nf+\nw1\u2217\n\u0013 \u0012\nw1\n0\n\u2243\n0\nw2\n\nw3\nw4\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\n1 0\n0 0\n\n\u0013\n\n\u2208 Cl3,0 f+ .\n\n(5)\n\nThen there is redundancy if \u03c8f+ , with \u03c8 given by eq.(2), is written. From the isomorphism in (4) we need only to use \u03c8f+ , with \u03c8 = s + b12 e12 + b13 e13 + b23 e23 \u2208 Cl+\n3,0 .\nWe now define the Weyl spinors [8]:\n\u2022 Contravariant undotted spinor (CUS):\nK = \u03c8f+\n\n(6)\n\nSuch spinor is written as\nK = \u03c8f+\n\n=\n\n(s + b12 e12 + b13 e13 + b23 e23 )f+\n\n=\n\n(s + b12 e123 )(f+ ) + (b13 + b23 e123 )(e1 f+ )\n\n=\n\nk 1 (f+ ) + k 2 (e1 f+ ),\n\n(7)\n\n\fwhere\nk1\nk\n\n2\n\n= s + b12 e123\n= b\n\n13\n\nand\n\n23\n\n+ b e123 .\n\n(8)\n\nThe CUS are chosen to be written in this form because their components commute\nwith the basis {f+ , e1 f+ } of the algebraic spinors. Therefore all spinor components\nare written as elements of the center of Cl3,0 , that is well-known to be isomorphic to\n\u039b0 (R3 ) \u2295 \u039b3 (R3 ).\nFrom the spinor K, other three types of spinors in Cl3,0 are constructed:\n\u2022 Covariant undotted spinor (CVUS):\nK\u2217 := e1 K\n\n(9)\n\nBy this definition, the expression\nK\u2217\n\n=\n\ne1 (k1 f+ + k2 e1 f+ )\n\n=\n\ne1 (f\u2212 k 1 + f\u2212 (\u2212e1 )k 2 )\n\n=\n\n(\u2212k 2 )f+ + (k 1 )(f+ e1 )\n\n(10)\n\ncan immediately be written.

In\nthe formalism presented in this section, \u03c8 is represented by a 2 \u00d7 2 complex matrix,\nwith eight real parameters, where the matrices act by left and/or right multiplication.\nThe element \u03a8 \u2208 Cl3,0 can be interpreted as the composition of three operations:\ndilation, duality and Lorentz transformations (more specifically R is not a Lorentz\ntransformation, but does generate a Lorentz transformation). Indeed, denoting \u03b35 =\n\u03b30123 , for \u03a8 \u2208 Cl3,0 , \u03a8\u03a8\u0304 is expressed as a + \u03b35 b = \u03c1e\u03b35 \u03b2 , \u03c1 > 0, and we can express\n[14, 15, 16]\n\u221a\n(59)\n\u03a8 = \u03c1 e\u03b35 \u03b2/2 R,\nwhere RR\u0304 = 1 and \u03b2 is the Takabayasi angle [22, 23]. Consequently, R \u2208 $pin+ (1, 3)\nand R generates a Lorentz transformation [18].\n\n3.1\n\nThe plane wave solution of the Dirac equation in Cl3,0\n\nThe Dirac equation (eq.(58)) is written, in the absence of external fields, as:\n\u2202t \u03a8 + \u2207\u03a8 = \u2212m\u03a8\u0302Ie3 ,\n\n\u03a8 \u2208 Cl3,0 .\n\n(60)\n\nSince eq.(60) is invariant under Lorentz transformations, we first solve the equation\nin a rest referential and, after this, a boost L is applied. In the Pauli algebra Cl3,0 ,\nthe action of the momentum operator p on the wave function \u03a8 \u2208 Cl3,0 is given by\np\u03a8 = \u2207\u03a8Ie3 .\n\n(61)\n\nThe eigenvector of p is p \u2208 R3 and in the rest referential, p = 0. Then eq.(60) is\nwritten as\n\u2202t \u03a8 = \u2212m\u03a8\u0302Ie3\n(62)\nConsider the solution of eq.(62) to be of the type\n\n\u03a8 = \u03a80 exp(\u2212Ie3 \u03c9).\n\n(63)\n\nSubstituting this solution is eq.(62) we obtain\n\u03a80 \u03c9 = m\u03a8\u03020 .\n\n(64)\n\nIt follows that, in the case of even multivectors, the relation \u03a80 = \u03a8\u03020 is satisfied,\nand in these conditions \u03c9 = m. For odd multivectors, \u03a80 = \u2212\u03a8\u03020 and consequently\n\u03c9 = \u2212m.\nWe first investigate elements of \u039b0 (R3 ) \u2295 \u039b2 (R3 ) \u0592\u2192 Cl3,0 . For \u03a80 \u2208 \u039b0 (R3 ), the\nsolution is given (up to scalars) by:\n\u03a8 = exp(\u2212Ie3 mt).\n\n(65)\n\nOn the other hand, for \u03a80 \u2208 \u039b2 (R3 ), there are three possibilities: \u03a80 = e1 e2 , \u03a80 =\ne1 e3 and \u03a80 = e2 e3 (the general case is obtained by linearity).\n\n\f1. The expression e1 e2 = Ie3 = exp(Ie3 \u03c0/2) shows that the choice e1 e2 only adds\nthe phase factor to the spinor (wave function).\n2. The choice \u03a80 = e2 e3 is obtained from \u2212(e1 e2 )(e1 e3 ) = e2 e3 , and it only adds\na phase factor to the third choice:\n3. \u03a80 = e1 e3 .\nThen the second solution of eq.(62) is given by\n\u03a8 = e1 e3 exp(\u2212Ie3 mt).\n\n(66)\n\nThe two solutions given by eqs.(65) and (66) are positive frequency solutions [4, 20].\nIn order to obtain the other two solutions of the Dirac equation in Cl3,0 , we must\ninvestigate elements of \u039b1 (R3 ) \u2295 \u039b3 (R3 ) \u0592\u2192 Cl3,0 . For \u03a80 \u2208 \u039b3 (R3 ), we have the\nsolution:\n\u03a8 = I exp(Ie3 mt).\n(67)\nFor the fourth solution, let \u03a80 \u2208 \u039b1 (R3 ). Then the solution is obtained if eq.(67) is\nleft multiplied by e1 e2 , e2 e3 or e1 e3 , since the general case is obtained by linearity.\nFrom the same reason cited in the last paragraph, after eq.(65), all the choices other\nthan e1 e3 are redundant, in the sense that they only add a phase factor in \u03a8. With\nthe choice e1 e3 , we have e1 e3 I = e2 . Then the fourth solution of eq.(62) is given by\n\u03a8 = e2 exp(Ie3 mt).\n\n(68)\n\nA general solution of eq.(62) is given by the linear span of the four solutions obtained,\nlisted below:\n\u03a8(+\u2191) = exp(\u2212Ie3 mt)\n\u03a8(+\u2193) = e1 e3 exp(\u2212Ie3 mt)\n(69)\n\u03a8(\u2212\u2191) = I exp(Ie3 mt)\n\u03a8(\u2212\u2193) = e2 exp(Ie3 mt)\nIt is worth to note that the general solution of \u03a8 is given, up the phase factor\n\u03a8 7\u2192 \u03a8exp(\u03b1Ie3 ). The general solution is given by the linear combination (with\nC-coefficients) of the solutions given by eqs.(69). The C-coeficients are of the form\n(c + dIe3 ),\n\nc, d \u2208 R.\n\n(70)\n\nThey right multiply the functions. The left linear combination is forbidden, since\nthe operator \u2207 does not commute with this possibility. For a particle with momentum\np we obtain the solution if the boost L = L(p) is applied [24]:\n\u03a8(+\u2191)\n\u03a8(+\u2193)\n\u03a8(\u2212\u2191)\n\u03a8(\u2212\u2193)\n\n3.2\n\n= L(p) exp[\u2212Ie3 (Et \u2212 p * x)]\n= L(p) e1 e3 exp[\u2212Ie3 (Et \u2212 p * x)]\n= L(p) I exp[Ie3 (Et \u2212 p * x)]\n= L(p) e2 exp[Ie3 (Et \u2212 p * x)]\n\n(71)\n\nDirac spinors\n\nPenrose denotes a Dirac spinor as an element of GA \u2295 GA\u2032 [9]. Since the Dirac\nspinor has four C-components, it suggests that the Dirac spinor can be described as\na multivector of Cl3,0 . In the present formalism, the Dirac spinor \u03c8 is an element of\nCl3,0 f+ \u2295 Cl3,0 f\u2212 \u2243 Cl3,0 . Indeed,\nCl3,0 \u220b \u03c8\n\n= \u03c8(f+ + f\u2212 ) = \u03c8f+ + \u03c8e1 f+ e1\n= K + Le1 ,\n\n(72)\n\n\fwhere\nK = \u03c8f+ and L = \u03c8(e1 f+ ).\n\n(73)\n\n3.3 Decomposition of the Dirac equation in terms of Weyl\nspinors\nThe Dirac equation in Cl3,0 , eq.(58), is led to two Weyl equations [21]. Indeed,\nconsider eq.(58) without external fields:\n(\u2202t + \u2207)\u03c8Ie3 = m\u03c8\u0302,\n\n\u03c8 \u2208 Cl3,0 .\n\n(74)\n\nBesides, consider the decomposition \u03c8 = \u03c8f+ + \u03c8f\u2212 , where f\u00b1 = 12 (1 \u00b1 e3 ). We write\n\u03be\n\n:=\n\n\u03b7\u0302\n\n:=\n\n\u03c8f+ \u2208 Cl3,0 f+\n\n\u03c8f\u2212 \u2208 Cl3,0 f\u2212\n\n(75)\n\nsince fc\n+ = f\u2212 . The correspondence with the notation used in the last subsection is\ngiven by\n\u03be = K and \u03b7\u0302 = Le1 .\n(76)\nIt follows that\n(\u2202t + \u2207)(\u03be + \u03b7\u0302)Ie3 = m(\u03be\u02c6 + \u03b7),\n\n(77)\n\n(\u2202t + \u2207)\u03beI \u2212 (\u2202t + \u2207)\u03b7\u0302I = m\u03be\u02c6 + m\u03b7,\n\n(78)\n\nand then\nwhere the relations \u03bee3 = \u03be and \u03b7\u0302e3 = \u2212\u03b7\u0302 follows from the fact that \u03be \u2208 Cl3,0 f+ and\n\u03b7\u0302 \u2208 Cl3,0 f\u2212 .\nSeparating the terms in Cl3,0 f+ and in Cl3,0 f\u2212 two equations are obtained:\n(\u2202t + \u2207)\u03beI\n\n=\n\n\u2212(\u2202t + \u2207)\u03b7\u0302I =\n\nm\u03b7,\n\u02c6\nm\u03be.\n\n(79)\n(80)\n\nTaking the graded involution of the last equation, the Dirac equation in terms of the\nWeyl spinors gives the following coupled system:\n(\u2202t + \u2207)\u03beI = m\u03b7\n\n(81)\n\n(\u2202t \u2212 \u2207)\u03b7I = m\u03be\nThis result is presented, e.g., in [20, 21].\n\n3.4 Decomposition of the Dirac equation in terms of Pauli\nspinors\nA multivector \u03c8 \u2208 Cl3,0 is written as\nCl3,0 \u220b \u03c8\n\n=\n\na + ai ei + aij eij + pe123\n\n=\n\na + a12 e12 + a23 e23 + a13 e13 + (a3 + a1 e13 + a2 e23 + pe12 )e3\n\n=\n\n\u03c6 + \u03c7e3 ,\n\n\u03c6, \u03c7 \u2208 Cl+\n3,0 .\n\n(82)\n\nIf we substitute in eq.(74) it follows that\n(\u2202t + \u2207)(\u03c6 + \u03c7e3 )Ie3 = m(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c7e3 ),\n\n(83)\n\n\fThis equation is separated in even and odd parts:\n\u2202t \u03c6Ie3 + \u2207\u03c7I = m\u03c6\n\n(84)\n\n\u2202t \u03c7Ie3 + \u2207\u03c6I = \u2212m\u03c7\na system of two coupled equations.\n\n3.5 Paravectors of Minkowski spacetime obtained from Weyl\nspinors in Cl3,0\nAn arbitrary paravector [25, 26, 27] v \u2208 R \u2295 R3 is written as\nv := Ke1 K = Ke1 e1 K\u0303 = KK\u0303.\n\n(85)\n\nFrom eqs.(6) and (15), we obtain:\nKK\u0303 =\n\nk1 k\n\n1\u2032\n\nk1 k\n\n2\u2032\n\nk2 k\n\n1\u2032\n\nk2 k\n\n2\u2032\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(86)\n\nGiven\nK = k 1 f+ + k 2 e1 f+ \u2208 Cl3,0 f+\nand\n\n1\u2032\n\n(87)\n\n2\u2032\n\nK = k (f\u2212 e1 ) + k (f\u2212 ) \u2208 Cl3,0 f\u2212 ,\n\n(88)\n\nwe have the expression\n1\u2032\n\n2\u2032\n\n1\u2032\n\n2\u2032\n\nKK\u0303 = Ke1 K = k 1 k f+ + k 1 k f+ e1 + k 2 k f\u2212 e1 + k 2 k f\u2212\n\n(89)\n\nUsing the representation (3) in eq.(86), the correspondence\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nf+ \u2190\u2192 oA oA ,\n\nf+ e1 \u2190\u2192 oA iA ,\n\n\u2032\n\nf\u2212 e1 \u2190\u2192 iA oA ,\n\nf\u2212 \u2190\u2192 iA iA\n\n\u2032\n\n(90)\n\nis obtained.

The\ncorrespondence between the idempotents that generate the four lateral minimal ideals\nin Cl3,0 is obtained, if the antiautomorphisms in Cl3,0 act on the four types of Weyl\nspinors, respctively elements of the minimal lateral ideals in Cl3,0 . The null tetrad\nis obtained in the paravector model of Minkowski spacetime. The Dirac equation\nin Cl3,0 is also presented and discussed. The plane wave solutions of such equation\nare constructed and the Dirac theory is formulated using the Cl3,0 structure, where\noperators, vectors and tensors are unified described by multivectors and multiforms\nin the Clifford formalism. The decomposition of the Dirac equation into a system of\ncoupled equations, written in terms of Weyl, and alternatively, Pauli spinors, is also\npresented.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors are greatly indebted to Dr. R. A. Mosna for pointing out some\nmistakes and for giving many other helpful suggestions.\n\n\fReferences\n[1] da Rocha R and Vaz J, Revisiting Clifford algebras and spinors I: the twistor group\nSU(2,2) in the Dirac algebra and some other remarks (math-ph/0412074).\n[2] Cartan E, The Theory of Spinors, MIT Press, Cambridge 1967.\n[3] Pauli W, On the hydrogen spectrum from the standpoint of the new quantum mechanics,\nZ.
