Introduction\nThree-dimensional gauge theories have some special features, notably the possibility of\nwriting a Chern-Simons kinetic term that is first-order in the derivatives[1, 2, 3]. In addition\nto this term, a (2+1)d gauge theory can have a conventional Maxwell kinetic term as well\nas an explicit mass term that typically arises via a Higgs mechanism. The possibility of\nthree distinct types of terms in the Lagrangian for free gauge fields makes for a more subtle\nspectrum than is familiar in four-dimensional field theory, where a free gauge field can only\nhave a Maxwell or mass term. In particular, parity violation is a generic feature of theories\nwith a Chern-Simons term.\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\fIf one now extends this structure to multiple species of gauge fields, new subtleties\narise. One of the most striking of these is a new type of Higgs mechanism wherein a\nnon-propagating gauge field absorbs the degree of freedom of a Higgs field and turns into\na massless propagating gauge field[4]. This phenomenon, the \"novel Higgs mechanism\"\n(NHM), was discovered and usefully applied to study the moduli space of extended superconformal field theories describing multiple membranes in M-theory, namely the BLG\nand ABJM field theories. Despite its origin, the mechanism itself does not rely on supersymmetry or string/M-theory. It is a subtle but elementary feature of ordinary quantum\nfield theory in (2+1)d, and as such could be of interest in a much wider context. In particular, it might well have applications in condensed-matter systems, where Chern-Simons\nfield theories are already known to play an interesting role (see for example [5, 6, 7, 8]).\nNotably the NHM occurs in systems that conserve parity[9, 10].\nOne purpose of this note is to analyse the spectrum of (2+1)d gauge theories with\nmultiple gauge fields. We will see that the novel Higgs mechanism arises for a very general\nclass of such theories. Our analysis reveals that the NHM arises out of a conflict between\nsimultaneous diagonalisability of the kinetic (Chern-Simons) terms and the mass terms.\nThis conflict in turn arises when one has Chern-Simons terms of both signs. There is no\nanalogue of this phenomenon in \"normal\" field theories with second-order kinetic terms,\nwhose sign is determined by requiring the absence of negative-norm states. One consequence of non-diagonalisability in (2+1)d is that it is not straightforward to read off the\nspectrum. As a result the spectrum can have various unusual features and the NHM turns\nout to be just one of these.\nA well-known characteristic of (2+1)d gauge theories with a single gauge field, observed\nnearly three decades ago[3], is that Maxwell gauge fields in 2+1 dimensions acquire a \"topological mass\" when a Chern-Simons interaction is added to the action. The propagating\ndegrees of freedom have a single degree of freedom with spin +1 but no corresponding spin\n\u22121 state (the reverse holds if we change the sign of the mass parameter). Subsequently[11],\n\nit was noticed that the topologically massive action, containing Maxwell and Chern-Simons\nterms, is equivalent to a different action with a Chern-Simons term and an explicit mass\nterm[12] but no Maxwell term. Both sides of this equivalence correspond to massive theories. We will see that the analogue of this duality in systems with multiple gauge fields\nprovides a natural setting to understand the NHM. Namely, in appropriately chosen systems the analogous duality maps a set of Chern-Simons and mass terms to a Maxwell term\nwithout a mass. In turn, the original theory with Chern-Simons and mass terms in turn\ncan descend from a conformal theory in which the mass terms are induced by a Higgs\nmechanism. This means a massless propagating Yang-Mills field can arise on the Higgs\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\fbranch of a conformal field theory.\nIn the context of M-theory membranes the NHM was originally presented[4] in a nonAbelian form and the emphasis was on those features that are relevant to multiple membrane dynamics. However in the present work we first spell it out in an Abelian setting\nwith Higgs fields carrying U(1) charges. Subsequently we introduce non-Abelian gauge\nfields with corresponding Yang-Mills and non-Abelian Chern-Simons terms, and discuss\nthe role of interactions. Towards the end some possible applications of the results are\nbriefly explored.\n\n2. Topological mass and novel Higgs mechanism\n2.1 Topologically massive theories\nWe start by reviewing the concept of topologically massive gauge theories in 2+1 dimensions[3]\nand their duality[11] to a class of Chern-Simons theories with an explicit mass term, proposed in Ref.[12] where they were dubbed \"self-dual actions\". It will be seen that the novel\nHiggs mechanism is an extension of these theories and dualities to the case of multiple\ngauge fields, providing a natural setting for the phenomenon. Since the immediate goal\nis to understand the spectrum of excitations, we initially work at the linearised level, or\nequivalently in the Abelian theory.\nThe basic topologically massive theory is given by a Lagrangian for a 1-form Abelian\ngauge field A with the Maxwell + Chern-Simons Lagrangian:\nL1 = 12 dA \u2227 \u2217dA \u2212 12 mA \u2227 dA\n\n(2.1)\n\nThe equations of motion of this theory are:\nd \u2217dA = m dA\n\n(2.2)\n\nAs explained in Ref.[3], this theory has a single on-shell degree of freedom that is massive\nand has spin +1. Because parity is violated, it is possible to have no spin \u22121 mode.\n\nNext consider a different Lagrangian consisting of a Chern-Simons term plus an explicit\n\nmass term:\nL2 = 12 A \u2227 dA + 12 m A \u2227 \u2217A\n\n(2.3)\n\nThis is the self-dual Lagrangian of Ref.[12]. This time the equations of motion are:\n\u2217\n\ndA = mA\n\n(2.4)\n\nIt is easy to verify that the theory of Eq. (2.3) is equivalent to that of Eq. (2.1). Classically,\nthe equivalence is shown as follows. First,\n\u2217\n\ndA = mA =\u21d2 d \u2217dA = m dA\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n(2.5)\n\n\fso L2 =\u21d2 L1 . For the converse,\nd \u2217dA = m dA =\u21d2 d (\u2217dA \u2212 m A) = 0 =\u21d2 \u2217dA \u2212 m A = d\u03bb\nand a field re-definition A \u2192 A \u2212\n\n1\nm d\u03bb\n\n(2.6)\n\ngives Eq. (2.4). Thus L1 =\u21d2 L2 . A detailed\n\ndiscussion of the quantum-mechanical equivalence of the two theories can be found in\nRef.[11].\nLet us make some comments on this equivalence.\n1. Comparing the two Lagrangians Eq. (2.1) and Eq. (2.3) we see that the former is\n\ngauge-invariant while the latter does not seem to have a gauge symmetry. In fact, A in the\nsecond Lagrangian can be thought of as the dual field strength \u2217dA of the first one, so the\nsecond Lagrangian actually expresses the field content of the first one in gauge-invariant\nvariables. This is seen more clearly by introducing[11] a \"master Lagrangian\" involving\ntwo independent 1-form fields A and f :\nLmaster = 21 f \u2227 \u2217f + f \u2227 dA \u2212 12 mA \u2227 dA\n\n(2.7)\n\nThe equation of motion of f gives:\nf = \u2217dA\n\n(2.8)\n\ndf = m dA\n\n(2.9)\n\nwhile the equation of motion of A is:\n\nEliminating f we recover Eq. (2.2), while eliminating A (it is not algebraic, but only appears\nas dA so it can still be eliminated between the two equations of motion) we find Eq. (2.4)\nfor the field f .\n2. While Eq. (2.1) has a smooth massless limit, Eq. (2.3) becomes purely topological\nand thereby loses a degree of freedom as m \u2192 0. Indeed the proof of equivalence between\n\nthe two theories involves a gauge transformation that becomes singular as m \u2192 0 (see\n\nbelow Eq. (2.6)).\n\n3. In (2+1)d, the sign of the mass m of a state of a spin-1 field is meaningful and can\nbe interpreted as follows: m > 1 means the state has spin +1 and m < 1 means it has spin\n\u22121. For m = 0 the little group is trivial and there is no concept of spin.\n\n4. As observed in Ref.[13], in addition to gauge fields one can imagine having a scalar\n\nHiggs field in the system such that its vacuum expectation value generates the mass term in\nEq. (2.3). Therefore the conversion of a Chern-Simons action into a topologically massive\nYang-Mills action can be viewed as a kind of Higgsing.\n5. The coefficient of an interacting Chern-Simons term corresponding to a compact\ngauge group is required to be quantised. We temporarily ignore this requirement as it\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n\fmakes no difference to the present discussion. It will be more important when non-Abelian\ngauge fields and interactions are introduced.\nTo complete this discussion it is useful to write down the spectrum of the most general\nfree Lagrangian in (2+1)d involving a single gauge field, consisting of an arbitrary combination of all three terms: a Maxwell term, a Chern-Simons term and an explicit mass\nterm. Thus, consider:\nL = 21 w dA \u2227 \u2217 dA \u2212 12 xA \u2227 dA + 21 yA \u2227 \u2217 A\n\n(2.10)\n\nHere w, x, y are constants. While w must be positive, x, y can have either sign.\nFrom the preceding discussion we know that for y = 0 the theory has a single state\nof mass x/w, and for w = 0 there is a single state of mass \u2212y/x. For x = 0 there is a\np\npair of parity-conjugate states of mass \u00b1 y/w (which are tachyonic if y < 0). Finally, a\n\nparity transformation x \u2192 \u2212x should interchange the masses and spins of the two states,\n\ni.e. m1 \u2194 \u2212m2 . These considerations suffice to determine the spectrum of the generic\n\ntheory (which can more directly be obtained by examining the propagator). We have two\nstates of masses (m1 , m2 ) and spins (sign(m1 ), sign(m2 )) given by:\nm1 =\n\nx+\n\np\n\nx2 + 4wy\n,\n2w\n\nm2 =\n\nx\u2212\n\np\n\nx2 + 4wy\n2w\n\n(2.11)\n\nAs x \u2192 0 one gets the expected parity-symmetric answer. For w \u2192 0 one of the masses\ngoes to infinity and the other to the desired finite value. Finally for y \u2192 0 we find a massive\nstate of the correct mass, and apparently an extra massless state. However in this limit\n\ngauge invariance is recovered and has the effect of decoupling the would-be extra massless\nstate. As a result there is no massless state in the spectrum of the theory unless both the\nChern-Simons and the mass term are absent, i.e. x = y = 0.\n2.2 Multiple fields\nWe now consider multiple 1-form fields in (2+1)d with Chern-Simons and mass terms. We\ndo not include Maxwell terms to start with. The reason, as indicated in the introduction, is\nthat we would like to consider theories with an underlying conformal invariance broken only\nby a Higgs expectation value. Such a theory can have Chern-Simons terms and minimal\ncouplings for the gauge fields, but no Maxwell terms.\nNaively one would not expect to find any qualitatively new phenomena compared to\nwhat we have discussed in the previous subsection merely by introducing additional fields.\nAfter all, given a free field theory we usually diagonalise both the kinetic and mass terms\nbefore introducing interactions, and if this were possible in the presence of Chern-Simons\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n\fterms then we would obtain a set of decoupled theories, each one of the form of Eq. (2.10)\nwith w = 0. There can be no massless propagating degrees of freedom in such a theory.\nHowever, for (2+1)d theories with Chern-Simons and mass terms for multiple spin-1\nfields, there is a potential conflict between diagonalisability of these two terms. As we\nwill see shortly, this can lead to a qualitatively new feature: the possibility of a massless\npropagating state. This is what we call the novel Higgs mechanism (NHM). There are\nother interesting features that also arise for the first time when there are multiple fields.\nTo understand this issue consider a collection of fields AI , I = 1, 2, * * * n described by\n\nthe most general abelian Chern-Simons-mass Lagrangian (this can be generalised to include\nexplicit Maxwell terms):\nL = 21 kIJ A(I) \u2227 dA(J) + 21 mIJ A(I) \u2227 \u2217A(J)\n\n(2.12)\n\nBoth kIJ and mIJ are constant real symmetric matrices. kIJ is taken to be non-degenerate,\nwhile mIJ is allowed to have zero eigenvalues. The transformation:\n\u03b4A(I) = d\u039b(I)\n\n(2.13)\n\nis a gauge invariance for every set {\u039b(I) } satisfying mIJ \u039b(J) = 0, i.e. for every null\n\neigenvector of m. Let us now try to bring this action into standard form as a sum of free\nactions for n decoupled fields.\nFor comparison, we first recall how this is done for a generic free scalar field theory (in\nany dimension) with Lagrangian:\n\u2212 12 gIJ \u2202\u03bc \u03c6I \u2202 \u03bc \u03c6J \u2212 12 (m2 )IJ \u03c6I \u03c6J\n\n(2.14)\n\nwhere \u03c6i , I = 1, 2, * * * , n are real scalar fields. Here gIJ and (m2 )IJ are constant real\n\nsymmetric matrices and gIJ is positive-definite (otherwise the theory has ghosts). To bring\nthe Lagrangian into its standard form, one first performs an orthogonal transformation on\n\u03c6I to diagonalise gIJ , which then takes the form diag(g1 , g2 , * * * , gn ) with gI > 0 for all I.\nNext one re-scales the fields:\n\n\u03c6I\n\u03c6I \u2192 \u221a\ngI\n\n(2.15)\n\nso that the kinetic form has the identity metric \u03b4IJ . Finally one performs another orthogonal transformation on \u03c6I that diagonalises m2 while preserving the kinetic term, ending\nup with:\n\u2212 12 \u2202\u03bc \u03c6I \u2202 \u03bc \u03c6I \u2212 21 m2I \u03c6I \u03c6I\n\n(2.16)\n\nSome of the mI can be equal to zero and we can also allow some to be imaginary (i.e.\nm2I < 0) to allow for tachyons that are eventually stabilised by a potential. Thus the theory\nhas been reduced to a collection of decoupled fields, some massive and others massless.\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n\fWhen we try to apply the analogous procedure to Eq. (2.12), we find a rather different\nresult. Upon diagonalising kIJ , it turns into diag(k1 , k2 , * * * , kn ) but the eigenvalues ki\n\nare not required to be positive. The theory with negative eigenvalues, or both signs of\neigenvalues, is perfectly consistent and \u2013 as is now well-known \u2013 field theories relevant to Mbranes [14, 15] have levels of both signs, which even permits parity to be conserved[10]. To\nbe completely general, we therefore assume there are p negative and q positive eigenvalues\nwith p + q = n. Since the A(I) are real, the best we can do after diagonalising kIJ is to\nre-scale:\n\nA(I)\nA(I) \u2192 p\n|kI |\n\n(2.17)\n\nupon which the action Eq. (2.12) reduces to:\n\nL = 12 \u03b7IJ A(I) \u2227 dA(J) + 12 mIJ A(I) \u2227 \u2217A(J)\n\n(2.18)\n\nwhere \u03b7IJ is a diagonal matrix with p elements equal to \u22121 and the remaining q = n \u2212\np elements equal to +1: the Lorentzian metric preserved by O(p, q). Hence the linear\ntransformations AI \u2192 \u039bIJ AJ which preserve the kinetic term are given by matrices \u039bIJ\n\nsatisfying:\n\n\u039bT \u03b7\u039b = \u03b7\n\n(2.19)\n\nnamely the O(p, q) Lorentz transformations. The mass matrix can therefore be transformed\nonly as:\nm \u2192 \u039bT m\u039b, \u039b \u2208 O(p, q)\n\n(2.20)\n\nIn general, a Lorentz transformation is not sufficient to diagonalise m.\nWe would now like to know under what conditions there exists a Lorentz transformation\nthat diagonalises mIJ in the basis where kIJ is diagonal. Whenever this is possible, the\ntheory will reduce to a collection of decoupled free fields with definite masses, and there\nwill be no new phenomena such as the novel Higgs mechanism. The transformation law\nof the matrix mIJ in Eq. (2.20) is that of a second-rank symmetric tensor under O(p, q)\nLorentz transformations. Therefore this is analogous to the question of whether the stressenergy tensor T\u03bc\u03bd of a field theory can be diagonalised by Lorentz transformations in a\np + q-dimensional space of signature (p, q)1 .\nWe start by considering a general O(p, q) matrix \u039bI J which by definition satisfies:\n\u039bI K \u039bJ L \u03b7IJ = \u03b7KL ,\n\n\u03b7IJ = diag{\u22121, \u22121, * * * , \u22121, 1, 1, * * * , 1}\n|\n{z\n} | {z }\np\n\n1\n\n(2.21)\n\nq\n\nI thank Nemani Suryanarayana for this observation and for initial collaboration on the analysis below.\n\n\u20137\u2013\n\n\fwhere the indices I, J take the p + q values \u2212p + 1, \u2212p + 2, * * * , \u22121, 0, 1, * * * , q, so that\n\nnon-positive values label timelike directions. Let us now use i, j, * * * to label the space-\n\nlike directions (1, 2, * * * q), and m, n, * * * to label the time-like directions (\u2212p + 1, \u2212p +\n\nI\n2, * * * , \u22121, 0). Define a set of (p + q)-component vectors V(m)\n= \u039bI m and another set\n\nI = \u039bI . Clearly these vectors have the following orthonormality properties:\nW(i)\ni\n\n~(m) * V\n~(n) = \u2212\u03b4mn , W\n~ (i) * W\n~ (j) = \u03b4ij , V\n~(m) * W\n~ (i) = 0\nV\n\n(2.22)\n\n~(m) and\nwhere the inner product is defined using the metric \u03b7IJ . A collection of vectors V\n~ (i) satisfying the above orthogonality relations defines an element of O(p, q).\nW\nIf the mass matrix mIJ is block-diagonal, i.e, mim = 0, then we can always bring it\nto a diagonal form using matrices in O(p) \u00d7 O(q) \u2282 O(p, q). Therefore in order for mIJ to\n\nbe diagonalisable, it is sufficient to check whether it can be brought into a block-diagonal\n\nform. There exists an element of O(p, q) which achieves this if and only if we can find a\n~(m) and W\n~ (i) such that\ncollection of vectors V\nI\nJ\nV(m)\nW(i)\nmIJ = 0 \u2200 m, i .\n\n(2.23)\n\nThese then are the diagonalisability conditions. If they are satisfied the theory breaks up\ninto decoupled free fields, but if not then it can exhibit more interesting behaviour.\n2.3 Necessary and sufficient conditions: two-field case\nLet us first look at a simple example for which p = q = 1. We are working in a basis where\nthe kinetic term has already been diagonalised and scaled, so kIJ = (\u22121, 1). The most\n~ and W\n~ satisfying the conditions above are:\ngeneral vectors V\n~ = (sinh \u03b7, cosh \u03b7),\nV\n\n~ = \u00b1(cosh \u03b7, sinh \u03b7)\nW\n\n(2.24)\n\nParametrising:\n!\n\n(2.25)\n\na+c\n= coth 2\u03b7\n2b\n\n(2.26)\n\nmIJ =\n\na b\nb c\n\nwe easily find that Eq. (2.23) reduces to:\n\nfrom which the condition for diagonalisability follows:\n2 |b| < |a + c| .\n\n\u20138\u2013\n\n(2.27)\n\n\fThe eigenvectors and eigenvalues of mIJ are not invariant under Lorentz transformations. Hence it is convenient to reformulate the above condition in terms of the (nonsymmetric) matrix (\u03b7 m)IJ = \u03b7 IK mKJ :\n(\u03b7 m)IJ\n\n=\n\n\u2212a \u2212b\nb\n\nc\n\n!\n\n(2.28)\n\nSince it has one upper and one lower index, this matrix can be thought of as a linear transformation and one can ask for its eigenvectors and eigenvalues. These have been classified\n(in 3+1 dimensions) in works on general relativity, for example Ref.[16]. In 1+1 dimensions\nthere are precisely three possibilities:\nEigenvalues\n\nEigenvectors\n\n(i)\n\nTwo distinct, real\n\nTwo distinct, real (one spacelike, one timelike)\n\n(ii)\n\nTwo coincident\n\nOne\n\n(iii)\n\nComplex-conjugate pair\n\nComplex-conjugate pair\n\nCase (i) allows us to make an SO(1, 1) matrix:\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u039b = ~vt ~vs\n\n(2.29)\n\nwhere ~vt , ~vs are the orthonormalised eigenvectors, the first one timelike and the second\nspacelike. Clearly \u039b diagonalises \u03b7 m by a similarity transformation:\n\u039b\u22121 \u03b7 m \u039b = \u03b7 mdiag\n\n(2.30)\n\nwhere we have labelled the diagonal matrix as \u03b7 mdiag . Noting that \u039b\u22121 = \u03b7\u039bT \u03b7, we see\nthat:\n\u039bT m\u039b = mdiag\n\n(2.31)\n\n~ ,W\n~ . The other cases do not permit\nas desired. Clearly ~vt , ~vs are just the same as V\ndiagonalisation of \u03b7 m and thereby of m.\nIt is easy to check that the three cases above correspond to three sets of values for the\ndiscriminant of the eigenvalue equation for \u03b7m, namely \u2206 = (a + c)2 \u2212 4b2 :\n(i)\n\n\u2206 > 0 \u2192 2|b| < |a + c|\n\n(ii)\n\n\u2206 = 0 \u2192 2|b| = |a + c|\n\n(iii)\n\n\u2206 < 0 \u2192 2|b| > |a + c|\n\n(2.32)\n\nSince case (i) admits diagonalisation of the theory, it is trivial. We therefore study the\nsystem for cases (ii) and (iii). Labelling the two vector fields as A(1) , A(2) , the Lagrangian\n\n\u20139\u2013\n\n\fis:\nL1 = \u2212 21 A(1) \u2227 dA(1) + 21 A(2) \u2227 dA(2) + 12 aA(1) \u2227 \u2217 A(1)\n\n(2.33)\n\n+ bA(1) \u2227 \u2217 A(2) + 12 cA(2) \u2227 \u2217 A(2)\n\nNote that this Lagrangian is parity conserving, where the parity operation is taken as a\nreflection of space together with the interchange A(1) \u2194 A(2) .\n\nWe start with case (ii), namely |a+c| = 2|b|. As an example choose a = c =\n\nso the mass matrix is:\n\nmIJ\n\nm\n=\n2\n\n!\n1 \u22121\n\n\u22121 1\n\nm\n2 ,b\n\n= \u2212m\n2,\n(2.34)\n\nThen:\nL1 = \u2212 12 A(1) \u2227 dA(1) + 12 A(2) \u2227 dA(2) + 41 m(A(1) \u2212 A(2) ) \u2227 \u2217 (A(1) \u2212 A(2) )\n\n(2.35)\n\nSince the Chern-Simons and mass terms are not simultaneously diagonalisable, it is not immediately apparent how to deduce the spectrum of this theory. However, a field redefinition\nin terms of even and odd parity eigenstates:\nC=\n\n\u221a1 (A(2)\n2\n\n+ A(1) )\n\nB=\n\n\u221a1 (A(2)\n2\n\n\u2212 A(1) )\n\ncasts the Lagrangian into the more useful form:\nL1 = B \u2227 dC + 21 mB \u2227 \u2217B\n\n(2.36)\n\nNow one of the fields, namely B, is algebraic. The equations of motion are:\n\u2217\n\ndC = mB,\n\ndB = 0\n\n(2.37)\n\nand the first equation can be used to eliminate B. Inserting this back, the Lagrangian\nreduces to:\nL2 =\n\n1\ndC \u2227 \u2217dC\n2m\n\n(2.38)\n\nWe see that while L1 has the form of a generalised two-field self-dual theory, L2 is instead\n\na massless Maxwell Lagrangian. In theories where the mass term of Eq. (2.36) arises from\na Higgs mechanism, what happens physically is that the single degree of freedom of a real\nHiggs scalar gets traded for the single degree of freedom of a massless vector.\nInstead of integrating out B, an equivalent way to understand Eq. (2.36) is to define\nthe new 1-form field B \u2032 :\nB\u2032 = B \u2212\n\n1 \u2217\ndC\nm\n\n\u2013 10 \u2013\n\n(2.39)\n\n\fin terms of which the action becomes:\nL\u20322 =\n\n1\ndC \u2227 \u2217dC + 21 m B \u2227 \u2217B\n2m\n\n(2.40)\n\nand we have a free Maxwell field plus a decoupled auxiliary field.\nThe above example is precisely the free-field reduction of the one in which the NHM\nwas originally discovered[4]. Here we have derived it from a different point of view: by\nconstructing the simplest Chern-Simons-mass theory where the Chern-Simons and mass\nterms cannot be simultaneously diagonalised.\nTo study the more general version of case (ii), as well as case (iii), we continue to work\nin the basis of definite-parity fields where the coefficient of the Chern-Simons term is:\n!\n0 1\nkIJ =\n(2.41)\n1 0\nIn this basis the general mass matrix Eq. (2.25) becomes:\nmIJ =\n\n1\n2\n\na + c \u2212 2b\n\u2212a + c\n\n\u2212a + c\n\na + c + 2b\n\n!\n\n(2.42)\n\nThe Lagrangian is then:\nL = B \u2227 dC + 14 (a + c \u2212 2b)B \u2227 \u2217B + 21 (c \u2212 a)B \u2227 \u2217C + 14 (a + c + 2b)C \u2227 \u2217C\n\n(2.43)\n\nIf a + c 6= 2b then the equations of motion can be solved for B. Inserting this solution back\n\ninto the action, we find:\nL=\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1\ndC \u2227 \u2217dC + (a \u2212 c)C \u2227 dC + (ac \u2212 b2 )C \u2227 \u2217C\na + c \u2212 2b\n\nIt is convenient to change the normalisation of C at this point so that the coefficient\n\n(2.44)\n1\na+c\u22122b\n\nof the Lagrangian becomes 12 . Then comparing with Eq. (2.10), we have:\nw = 1,\n\nx = c \u2212 a,\n\ny = ac \u2212 b2\n\n(2.45)\n\nIt follows from Eq. (2.11) that the spectrum of this theory generically contains a pair of\nstates of masses:\n1\n2\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\np\nc \u2212 a \u00b1 (a + c)2 \u2212 4b2\n\n(2.46)\n\nAs already noted, the spin of the state is given by the sign of the mass. For a = c the theory\nis parity-conserving since the Chern-Simons term drops out, and there are two degenerate\nmassive states of spin \u00b11 as required by parity.\n\nThe theory above has a massless propagating gauge field if and only if x = y = 0. This\n\nmeans we must have a = c = \u00b1b. The positive sign is ruled out because we eliminated\n\n\u2013 11 \u2013\n\n\fthe field B on the assumption that a + c 6= 2b (however there is no loss of generality, since\n\nif a + c = 2b then we would have eliminated the field C instead and then the negative\n\nsign would have been ruled out). In conclusion, we have shown that for two fields, the\npurely Chern-Simons-mass action of Eq. (2.12) with a Lorentzian-signature Chern-Simons\nterm has a propagating massless mode if and only if a = c = \u2212b, in other words precisely\n\nthe mass matrix Eq. (2.34) that we used as an example of the NHM. This establishes that\nthere is a unique case with two fields. While we had already seen that the discriminant\n\u2206 = (a+c)2 \u22124b2 should be non-positive to ensure non-diagonalisability of the Lagrangian,\n\nwe now have a sufficient condition for NHM that requires both \u2206 = 0 and a = c.\n\nThere are other interesting cases. Whenever ac = b2 , the system has only a single massive excitation. This can be seen directly from the Lagrangian where B has been integrated\nout, namely Eq. (2.44), in which the explicit mass term drops out leaving a topologically\nmassive theory whose gauge invariance decouples the second excitation. Another special\ncase is when |a + c| = \u00b12|b| but a 6= c. In this case one finds two massive states of the\n\nsame mass and spin. This may be thought of as \"maximal parity violation\" and represents\nanother of the interesting situations arising from non-diagonalisability of the action. While\n\nthe same spectrum can also be obtained by just taking a pair of decoupled Chern-Simonsmass actions, the origin of parity violation is different: in the latter case it arises from the\nChern-Simons terms while in the former case it comes from the mass terms. This difference\nwill be relevant after introducing interactions.\nFinally, case (iii) in the notation of Eq. (2.32) corresponds to a discriminant \u2206 < 0.\nIn this case the spectrum consists of a conjugate pair of complex masses of spins \u00b11. We\n\nreserve judgement on whether such a theory is necessarily inconsistent, since interactions\n\nmight conceivably render it consistent. Note that the fields cannot be redefined to make the\nmasses purely real or imaginary (tachyonic) because those states would not then be spin\neigenstates. (In the parity conserving case c = a, the masses do become purely imaginary.)\nTherefore the complex-mass case is one of the interesting features arising in the spectrum\nof two-field models. We also see that the novel Higgs mechanism occurs on the boundary\nbetween a pair of topologically massive Chern-Simons theories and a Maxwell theory with\na complex mass.\n\n3. General number of fields\n3.1 Non-diagonalisability: a necessary condition\nThere are several different ways to describe the solution to the conditions for the novel\nHiggs mechanism in the general situation with three or more gauge fields. One of these,\n\n\u2013 12 \u2013\n\n\fwhich follows from considerations that we analysed in the previous subsection, is the following. Consider the matrix mIJ = \u03b7 IK mKJ . If this matrix has p distinct real timelike\neigenvectors and q distinct real spacelike eigenvectors then it can be diagonalised by a similarity transformation involving an SO(p, q) matrix, otherwise not. If it is not diagonalisable\nthen we may look for interesting phenomena including generalisations of the NHM.\nThe nature of possible eigenvectors of such a matrix in a space of Lorentzian signature is reviewed in [16] (for the case of 3+1 dimensions) using notation due to Segr\u00e9 and\nPleba\u0144ski. The case where the matrix possesses a maximal set of nondegenerate eigenvalues\nand corresponding distinct eigenvectors is referred to as algebraically general. In Segr\u00e9 notation, an algebraically general tensor has the label (1 1 * * * 1, 1 1 * * * 1) with p entries before\n\nthe comma representing timelike eigenvectors and q entries after the comma representing\n\nspacelike eigenvalues. All other cases are said to be algebraically special. These then are\nthe cases for which one has a non-diagonalisable mass matrix. The novel Higgs mechanism\nand any other interesting phenomena can therefore arise only for the algebraically special\ncase.\nThere is another way of stating the general diagonalisability condition Ref.[17, 18]\nthat will be more useful for us. These works contain a theorem on the possibility of\nsimultaneously diagonalising a pair of quadratic forms (A, B). In Section 12.12 of Ref.[17]\nit is proved that quadratic forms A and B in more than two variables can be simultaneously\ndiagonalised by a linear transformation if they have no common zeros along the diagonal\nin any basis2 .\nFor us the two quadratic forms are kIJ and mIJ . It is most convenient to choose a\nmaximally off-diagonal basis for the former. If we have p timelike and q spacelike directions\nwith p < q (the analysis is similar for p \u2265 q) we can bring kIJ to the form:\n\uf8eb\n\n0 IIp\n\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nkIJ = \uf8ec\nII\n0\n0\np\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n0 0 IIq\u2212p\n\n(3.1)\n\nFrom now on we always work in this basis. Then applying the theorem quoted above, mIJ\nwill be diagonalisable it does not have any zeroes on the diagonal in this basis. This then\nis the condition under which the theory splits into a sum of decoupled theories of the form\nof Eq. (2.10).\n2\n\nNotice that we have already encountered the exception to this theorem in the two-variable case of the\n\nprevious section. The non-diagonalisable case \u2206 < 0 discussed there includes a mass matrix with a = 0\nor c = 0, in a basis where the kinetic matrix is diag(\u22121, 1). Thus the two matrices do not have common\nzeroes along the diagonal but nevertheless cannot be diagonalised together.\n\n\u2013 13 \u2013\n\n\fOne expects that all other cases, namely those where mIJ has at least one zero on the\ndiagonal in its first 2p \u00d7 2p block, must represent something more exotic than a collection\n\nof decoupled fields. However that does not mean they all involve massless propagating\nfields. We have only found a necessary condition for this, and in the next section we will\nlook for sufficient conditions.\n3.2 Sufficient conditions: three field case\nLet us now consider the case with three fields and a kinetic matrix:\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n0 1 0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\u03b7IJ = \uf8ec\n1\n0\n0\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n0 0 1\n\n(3.2)\n\nThe most general Chern-Simons-mass theory with this content has the Lagrangian:\nL = B \u2227 dC + 21 D \u2227 dD + 21 \u03b1B \u2227 \u2217B + 21 \u03b2C \u2227 \u2217C + 12 \u03b3D \u2227 \u2217D\n\n(3.3)\n\n+ \u03bcB \u2227 \u2217C + \u03bdC \u2227 \u2217D + \u03c1D \u2227 \u2217B\n\nThe equation of motion of B is:\ndC + \u03b1 \u2217B + \u03bc\u2217 C + \u03c1\u2217 D = 0\n\n(3.4)\n\nSolving for B and inserting back in the Lagrangian, we find:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03bc2\n\u03bc\n\u03c1\n1\n\u2217\n1\ndC \u2227 dC \u2212 C \u2227 dC + 2 \u03b2 \u2212\nC \u2227 \u2217C \u2212 D \u2227 dC\nL=\n2\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0010\n\u0011\n2\n\u03bc\u03c1\n\u03c1\n+ \u03bd\u2212\nC \u2227 \u2217D + 12 D \u2227 dD + 21 \u03b3 \u2212\nD \u2227 \u2217D\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\n(3.5)\n\nThus we have a Maxwell coefficient matrix YIJ , a Chern-Simons matrix kIJ and a mass\nmatrix mIJ given by:\nYIJ =\n\n1\n\u03b1\n\n0\n\n0 0\n\n!\n\n,\n\nkIJ =\n\n\u2212 2\u03bc\n\u03b1\n\u2212 \u03b1\u03c1\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03c1\n\u03b1\n\n1\n\n!\n\n,\n\nmIJ =\n\n\u03b2\u2212\n\u03bd\u2212\n\n\u03bc2\n\u03b1\n\u03bc\u03c1\n\u03b1\n\n\u03bd\u2212\n\n\u03b3\u2212\n\n\u03bc\u03c1\n\u03b1\n\u03c12\n\u03b1\n\n!\n\n(3.6)\n\nEvidently the NHM, leading to a single massless propagating excitation, arises only if\n\u03b2 = \u03b3 = \u03bc = \u03bd = \u03c1 so there is no new example with three fields relative to the case already\nanalysed for two fields. However the spectrum is in general far more complicated. The\ntwo-field case was previously discussed in Sec.2.3, but with only Chern-Simons and mass\nterms. Now that a Maxwell term is also present, it is impossible to diagonalise all three\nterms simultaneously in general. Since the Maxwell term goes away in the far infrared, the\nanalysis for an interacting theory with the above quadratic terms will follow the analysis of\n\n\u2013 14 \u2013\n\n\fSec.2.3. For this we need to inspect Eq. (3.6) above which tells us that the Chern-Simons\nterm has indefinite signature if:\ndet kIJ = \u2212\n\n2\u03bc\n\u03c12\n\u2212 2 < 0\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\n(3.7)\n\nTherefore this is the case for which, at least in the infrared, the Lagrangian cannot be\ndiagonalised but may be analysed following the procedure outlined above.\n3.3 General case\nThe sufficient conditions for NHM in the multi-field case, at least for p = q (equal number\nof positive and negative eigenvalues for the Chern-Simons coefficient) can be found by\nrepeating the procedure for the two-field case. We work in the basis where the ChernSimons coefficient kIJ is given by Eq. (3.1) and divide the A(I) , I = 1, 2, * * * , 2p into two\nsets:\n\nAi = B i , i = 1, 2, * * * , p\nAp+i = C i , i = 1, 2, * * * , p\nThen the free Chern-Simons-mass Lagrangian takes the form:\nL = B i \u2227 dC i + 12 \u03b1ij B i \u2227 \u2217B j + \u03b2ij B i \u2227 \u2217C j + 12 \u03b3ij C i \u2227 \u2217C j\n\n(3.8)\n\nand the corresponding equations of motion are:\ndC i + \u03b1ij \u2217B j + \u03b2ij \u2217C j = 0\ndB i + \u03b2ij \u2217B j + \u03b3ij \u2217C j = 0\nNow suppose the matrix \u03b1ij is invertible. In that case we can solve the first equation for\nB i and insert this back into the original Lagrangian to get:\ni\n\u2217\nj\n\u22121\ni\nj\nL = 12 \u03b1\u22121\nij dC \u2227 dC \u2212 (\u03b1 \u03b2)ij C \u2227 dC +\n\n1\n2\n\n\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b2\u03b1\u22121 \u03b2\n\n\u0001\n\nij\n\nC i \u2227 \u2217C j\n\n(3.9)\n\nThe Chern-Simons term vanishes for every zero eigenvector of \u03b2. Moreover if such an\neigenvector is a simultaneous zero eigenvector of \u03b3 then the mass term also vanishes. We\nconclude that there is one massless propagating vector field for every simultaneous zero\neigenvector of the matrices \u03b2ij and \u03b3ij , under the condition that \u03b1ij is invertible. As in\nthe two-field case, the roles of \u03b1ij and \u03b3ij can be interchanged. If \u03b1ij is not invertible, as\nin a case we will encounter in the following subsection, then we need that it is nonzero on\nthe common zero eigenvector of \u03b2, \u03b3.\n\n\u2013 15 \u2013\n\n\f3.4 Higgs fields\nSo far we have been working with generic mass matrices, not specifying precisely how they\narise via a Higgs mechanism. Here we want to ask which kinds of charged fields give rise to\nthe different types of mass matrices discussed above. Let us work with an even number 2p\nof gauge fields. Since we are still working in the Abelian theory, each Higgs field is a scalar\n\u03c6~q carrying a set of charges under these gauge fields. To analyse the physics one needs to\nfix the basis for the gauge fields. It is easiest to choose this as in the previous subsection,\ni.e. divide them into two sets Bi , Ci , i = 1, 2. * * * , p.\nNext we choose the charges of a particular Higgs field to be ~q = (q1 , q2 , * * * qp ; r1 , r2 * * * , rp )\n\nwhere the qi are charges under Bi and the ri are charges under Ci . The kinetic term for\nsuch a scalar is:\np\np\n\u0011\n\u0010\nX\nX\nri C\u03bci \u03c6~q\nqi B\u03bci \u2212 i\n\u2202\u03bc \u2212 i\n\n2\n\n(3.10)\n\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\nIf \u03c6~q acquires a (complex) vev h\u03c6~q i = v~q , one gets a mass matrix:\nmIJ = 2|v~q |2\n\nqi qj qi rj\nri qj ri rj\n\n!\n\n(3.11)\n\nWe can identify the matrices \u03b1ij , \u03b2ij , \u03b3ij of the previous subsection with qi qj , qi rj , ri rj\nrespectively (upto an overall proportionality constant). Now any vector vj orthogonal to\nrj , i.e. satisfying rj vj = 0, will be a common zero eigenvector of the matrices \u03b2, \u03b3 and,\naccording to the analysis of the previous subsection, can give rise to a massless propagating\nfield. However qi qj is also singular, with only one nonzero eigenvector qj itself. Therefore\nto end up with a massless propagating field requires qj vj 6= 0.\nAs a by-now familiar example, take p = 1, Nf = 1, and let the single scalar carry\ncharges (q; r). The mass matrix is then:\nmIJ = 2|v~q |2\n\nq 2 qr\nqr r 2\n\n!\n\n(3.12)\n\nWith q or r vanishing, this gives us a = c = |b| in the previous notation and one has NHM.\n\nThus we have rederived the well-known result[4, 10] that with two gauge fields A1 , A2 (in\na diagonal basis for the Chern-Simons term) and one scalar, the latter must be equally or\noppositely charged under both (\"bi-fundamental\", in the non-Abelian case) to give rise to\nthe novel Higgs mechanism. Moreover, this is seen to be essentially unique. In the generic\ncase with both q, r 6= 0, one easily sees that |a + c| > 2|b| so the action is diagonalisable\nand there are no novel features.\n\n\u2013 16 \u2013\n\n\fWith a number of independent Higgs fields \u03c6~q A , A = 1, 2, * * * , Nf we get the mass\n\nmatrix:\n\nmIJ = 2\n\nNf\nX\ni=1\n\nqiA qjA qiA rjA\n\n2\n\n|v~q A |\n\nriA qjA riA rjA\n\n!\n\n(3.13)\n\nIn this case one can achieve the maximal number of massless propagating fields, namely\np, by simply taking Nf = p scalars each with qi 6= 0 for one i and ri = 0 for all i. This\namounts to a straightforward set of copies of the two-field bi-fundamental case, but then\n\none should not expect to find anything more than that at the Abelian level. Things can\nbecome more complicated when there are non-Abelian interactions.\n\n4. Non-abelian case\nThe non-Abelian Chern-Simons system with multiple fields presents some new features that\ninfluence the NHM. One well-known feature is that the coefficient of the Chern-Simons term\nis quantised for compact gauge groups and we cannot ignore it or scale it to unity as we\ndid in the preceding sections.\n4.1 Difference Chern-Simons\nLet us start with the simplest example, a G \u00d7 G theory with level k for both the gauge\n\ngroups. We write the difference Chern-Simons action as:\nLCS =\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\nk\ntr A \u2227 dA + 32 A \u2227 A \u2227 A \u2212 \u00c3 \u2227 d\u00c3 \u2212 23 \u00c3 \u2227 \u00c3 \u2227 \u00c3\n4\u03c0\n\n(4.1)\n\nwhere A = Aa T a and trT a T b = \u2212 21 \u03b4ab . For compact G, k is required to be an integer in\n\norder to have gauge invariance under large gauge transformations[3].\n\nComparing with our discussion above, this corresponds to the basis in which the coefficient matrix \u03b7IJ = diag(\u22121, 1). In this basis the non-Abelian gauge invariance is the\nnormal one:\n\u03b4A = d\u039b + [A, \u039b],\n\n\u03b4\u00c3 = d\u039b\u0303 + [\u00c3, \u039b\u0303]\n\n(4.2)\n\nThe second basis, in which \u03b7IJ is purely off-diagonal, is obtained as before by taking\nthe linear combinations\nB = 12 (A \u2212 \u00c3),\n\nC = 21 (A + \u00c3),\n\nF (C) = dC + C \u2227 C\n\n(4.3)\n\n(the fields B and C thereby correspond to those in the Abelian case, but normalised\n\u221a\nslightly differently to avoid ugly factors of 2 in the Lagrangian). In these variables, the\nLagrangian becomes:\nLCS =\n\n\u0011\nk \u0010\ntr B \u2227 F (C) + 13 B \u2227 B \u2227 B\n\u03c0\n\n\u2013 17 \u2013\n\n(4.4)\n\n\fand the gauge transformations take the somewhat non-standard form:\n\u03b4B = d\u039bB + [C, \u039bB ] + [B, \u039bC ]\n\u03b4C = d\u039bC + [C, \u039bC ] + [B, \u039bB ]\n\n(4.5)\n\nThe equations of motion in the A, \u00c3 basis are just the equations for two independent\nflat connections:\nF = F\u0303 = 0\n\n(4.6)\n\nHowever in the B, C basis they look like:\nF (C) + B \u2227 B = 0\n\nD (C) B \u2261 dB + [C, B] = 0\n\n(4.7)\n\nNow we would like to give a mass via the Higgs mechanism. The structure of the mass\nmatrix arises via the choice of representation of the group G \u00d7G under which the Higgs field\ntransforms. The canonical choice is the bi-fundamental, for example the (N, N\u0304 of SU (N ):\n\u03b4\u03a6 = \u2212\u039b\u03a6 + \u03a6\u039b\u0303\n\n(4.8)\n\nIn this case the covariant derivative is:\nD\u03bc \u03a6 = \u2202\u03bc \u03a6 + A\u03bc \u03a6 \u2212 \u03a6\u00c3\u03bc\n\n(4.9)\n\nFor convenience we will normalise the scalar kinetic term as:\nk\ntr(D\u03bc \u03a6\u2020 D \u03bc \u03a6)\n4\u03c0\n\n(4.10)\n\nwhere this trace is, formally, unrelated to that in the gauge field action \u2013 here it just\nsums over two pairs of repeated indices in the fundamental representation, one pair being\nassociated to each gauge group of G \u00d7 G. This kinetic term gives rise to the interaction:\nk\ntr A\u03bc \u03a6 \u2212 \u03a6\u00c3\u03bc\n4\u03c0\n\n2\n\n(4.11)\n\nWith a Higgs vev proportional to the identity: h\u03a6i = vII, the mass term is equal to\nk 2\nv tr(A\u03bc \u2212 \u00c3\u03bc )2\n4\u03c0\n\n(4.12)\n\nwhere now the trace is over the Lie algebra of G after identifying the two factors in G \u00d7 G.\n\nWe see that the mass matrix has the form:\nmIJ \u223c\n\n!\n1 \u22121\n\n\u22121\n\n\u2013 18 \u2013\n\n1\n\n(4.13)\n\n\fwhich we have encountered many times over as the basic example of NHM.\nThis time, however, one has to keep track of the cubic terms in B. With the above\nvev, one has the Lagrangian:\nL=\n\n\u0011\nk \u0010\ntr B \u2227 F (C) + 13 B \u2227 B \u2227 B \u2212 v 2 B \u2227 \u2217B\n\u03c0\n\n(4.14)\n\nFrom this follows the equation of motion for B:\n\nF (C) + B \u2227 B \u2212 2v 2 \u2217B = 0\n\n(4.15)\n\nThe quadratic term in B now makes it impossible, unlike in the Abelian case, to simply\nsolve for B and eliminate it. The best we can do is solve recursively, to get:\n1 \u2217 (C)\nF\n\u2212\n2v 2\n1\n= \u2212 2 \u2217F (C) \u2212\n2v\n\nB=\u2212\n\n1 \u2217\n(B \u2227 B)\n2v 2\n1 \u2217 \u2217 (C) \u2217 (C)\n(F\n\u2227 F ) + ***\n8v 6\n\n(4.16)\n\nThe terms in * * * above contain all powers of F (C) , appearing in combinations like:\n\u2217 \u2217 (C)\n\n(F\n\n\u2227 \u2217(\u2217F (C) \u2227 * * * \u2217(\u2217F (C) \u2227 \u2217F (C) )))\n\n(4.17)\n\nThese are made by wedging the 1-form dual to F (C) with itself, then dualising the result\nback to a 1-form and repeating indefinitely. This nonlinear combination of field strengths\nappears to be unique to (2+1)d. Moreover, the orders in this expansion are counted by\nthe parameter\n\n1\n.\nv2\n\nWe may now insert Eq. (4.16) back into the Lagrangian of Eq. (4.14) to find:\n\u0013\n\u0012\nk\n1 \u2217 (C) \u2217 (C) \u2217 (C)\n1 (C) \u2217 (C)\nL=\nF\n\u2227 F\n\u2227 F\n+ ***\n\u2227 F\n\u2212\n\u2212 2F\n\u03c0\n4v\n24v 6\n\n(4.18)\n\nWe see that taking v \u2192 \u221e allows us to ignore the higher-order terms in F (C) . However, in\n\nthe quadratic term, v 2 plays the role of the Yang-Mills coupling constant[4]. Therefore in\n\nthe same limit that decouples the higher-order terms, the Yang-Mills term becomes very\nstrongly coupled. This can be avoided by simultaneously scaling k \u2192 \u221e, v \u2192 \u221e keeping\nk\nfixed[19]. In this limit the higher-order terms\nv2\n\u221av remains finite and can be chosen arbitrarily.\nk\n\ndo drop out, but the Yang-Mills coupling\n\nOne can take the Higgs field in a slightly different representation that is equivalent\nto the previous one in the Abelian case but differs in the non-Abelian case. This is the\nbi-fundamental (N, N ) rather than (N, N\u0304 )3 . In this case the gauge transformation is:\n\u03b4\u03a6 = \u2212\u039b\u03a6 \u2212 \u03a6\u039b\u0303\n3\n\n(4.19)\n\nThis representation arises in the fermionic sector of certain orientifold field theories, as in Ref.[20].\n\n\u2013 19 \u2013\n\n\fand the covariant derivative is:\nD\u03bc \u03a6 = \u2202\u03bc \u03a6 + A\u03bc \u03a6 + \u03a6\u00c3\u03bc\nThis time the vev h\u03a6i = vII gives rise to a mass matrix:\n!\n1 1\nmIJ \u223c\n1 1\n\n(4.20)\n\n(4.21)\n\nwhich at the Abelian level has the same properties as Eq. (4.13) above and gives rise to the\nNHM, with the difference that the field C \u223c A + \u00c3 is eliminated and the field B \u223c A \u2212 \u00c3\n\nbecomes propagating. However in the non-Abelian case the cubic terms are different. The\nLagrangian after Higgsing is:\nL=\n\n\u0011\nk \u0010\ntr B \u2227 F (C) + 13 B \u2227 B \u2227 B \u2212 v 2 C \u2227 \u2217C\n\u03c0\n\n(4.22)\n\nWe need to integrate out C, so the first term has to be rewritten:\nB \u2227 F (C) = B \u2227 dC + B \u2227 C \u2227 C\n\n(4.23)\n\n= C \u2227 dB + B \u2227 C \u2227 C\nwhere we have performed integration by parts on the kinetic term. The equation of motion\nfor C is:\ndB + 2B \u2227 C \u2212 2v 2 \u2217C = 0\n\n(4.24)\n\nwhich gives:\n1 \u2217\n1\ndB \u2212 2 \u2217(B \u2227 C)\n2\n2v\nv\n1 \u2217\n1\n= \u2212 2 dB + 4 \u2217(B \u2227 \u2217dB) + * * *\n2v\n2v\n\nC=\u2212\n\n(4.25)\n\nThis time the higher-order terms are made up of combinations like:\n\u2217\n\n(B \u2227 \u2217(B \u2227 * * * \u2217(B \u2227 \u2217dB)))\n\n(4.26)\n\nwhich should be contrasted with Eq. (4.17).\nIt is manifest from the construction of Eq. (4.17) and Eq. (4.26) that these nonlinear\nterms are gauge invariant (after taking a trace) under the transformations in Eq. (4.5).\nThese (perhaps novel) gauge-invariant combinations are building blocks that may have\ninteresting applications in the study of M-theory membrane actions.\nOne can consider yet other representations for the Higgs field(s). But as in the Abelian\ncase, it is clear that fields which transform only under one or other gauge group give\nuninteresting decoupled gauge symmetries.\n\n\u2013 20 \u2013\n\n\f4.2 B \u2227 F theory\nThere is a different non-Abelian generalisation of the Abelian difference Chern-Simons\ntheory. Instead of writing a difference of two non-Abelian Chern-Simons terms, we start\ndirectly with the action:\n2 trB \u2227 F (C)\n\n(4.27)\n\nwith gauge invariances:\n\u03b4B = d\u039bB + [C, \u039bB ] + [B, \u039bC ]\n\u03b4C = d\u039bC + [C, \u039bC ]\n\n(4.28)\n\nAt the Abelian level this is still the difference of two Chern-Simons actions. However the\nabsence of the last term in \u03b4C as compared with Eq. (4.5) means the non-Abelian gauge\ninvariance is different. Introducing a suitable scalar field one can get a mass term:\nv 2 tr B\u03bc B \u03bc\n\n(4.29)\n\nBecause of the absence of a B 3 term, this time the end-point of the NHM is the massless\nYang-Mills theory without any corrections. This means the theory above can be thought of\nas a reformulation of (2+1)d Yang-Mills theory, a point which was stressed in the M-theory\ncontext in Ref.[21].\nThe theory in Eq. (4.27) together with the mass term in Eq. (4.29) can be obtained by\nstarting with Eq. (4.14), performing the re-scaling:\nB \u2192 \u03bb\u22121 B,\n\nk \u2192 \u03bbk,\n\nv\u2192\n\n\u221a\n\n\u03bbv\n\n(4.30)\n\nand then taking the limit \u03bb \u2192 \u221e. In this sense it is just a limiting case of difference\n\nChern-Simons theory. Note that the final Yang-Mills coupling gYM 2 \u223c v 2 /k remains finite\n\nin this limit. It is not clear that k should be quantised in the final theory, in fact it can be\nabsorbed in a redefinition of B.\n\n5. Potential applications\nIn this section I offer some speculative ideas about the possible occurrence of the NHM in\nthe context of condensed-matter physics as well as gravity. Though there will be no definite\nconclusion in either case, it is tantalising that known field theories arising in both contexts\nquite naturally exhibit a structure of multiple gauge fields and a difference-Chern-Simons\nLagrangian. Therefore it is plausible that, with more investigation, a physical setting for\nthe NHM can be found in each case.\n\n\u2013 21 \u2013\n\n\f5.1 Condensed-matter systems\nAbelian Chern-Simons gauge fields play a key role in understanding phenomena like the\nfractional quantum Hall effect (see for example Refs.[5, 6, 7, 8]). In particular the ChernSimons term generates a change from Bose/Fermi to anyon statistics. Several gauge fields\nappear in the problem. To start with there is of course the electromagnetic field, which\nbeing massless has only a Maxwell term. Subsequently a \"statistical gauge field\" is introduced, having a Chern-Simons term with a suitable coefficient. In the treatment of Ref.[8]\nthere are also several other gauge fields. A set of m gauge fields is introduced so that the\nfermionic operators in the Lagrangian can be replaced by bosonic operators, one for each\nof m Landau levels. Another set comes in upon dualising the Goldstone modes into gauge\nfields using scalar-gauge duality in (2+1)d.\nLet us briefly review this and see how structures similar to those we have been discussing in previous sections could arise. In units where ~ = c = e = 1, e being the electric\ncharge quantum, a fractional Hall system in some definite Landau level is described by the\nLagrangian (the electrons \u03c8 are nonrelativistic):\nL = \u03c8 \u2020 i(\u22020 \u2212 iA0 )\u03c8 +\n\n1 \u2020\n1\n\u03c8 (\u2202i \u2212 iAi )2 \u03c8 \u2212 F\u03bc\u03bd F \u03bc\u03bd\n2m\n4\n\nwhere A\u03bc is the external electromagnetic field. The filling fraction is \u03bd =\n\n(5.1)\n2\u03c0n\nB\n\nwhere n is\n\nthe number of electrons per unit area and B is the magnetic field, B = dA.\nWe now modify this Lagrangian by introducing a new Abelian gauge field \u03b1\u03bc and\nmodify the above Lagrangian to:\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u00112\n1 \u2020\u0010\nL = \u03c8 \u2020 i \u22020 \u2212 i(A0 + \u03b10 ) \u03c8 +\n\u03c8 \u2202i \u2212 i(Ai + \u03b1i ) \u03c8\n2m\n1\n1\n+ dA \u2227 \u2217dA +\n\u03b1 \u2227 d\u03b1\n2\n4\u03c0p\n\n(5.2)\n\nThe equation of motion for \u03b1\u03bc is:\n\u2217\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nd\u03b1 = \u22122\u03c0pj\n\n(5.3)\n\n~\nwhere j\u03bc = \u03c8 \u2020 \u03c8, \u03c8 \u2020 \u2207\u03c8\nis the current. It follows that the electrons effectively move in\n\na reduced magnetic field Beff = B \u2212 2\u03c0pn. Thereby the filling fraction changes to:\n\u03bd \u2192 \u03bdeff =\n\n\u03bd\n2\u03c0n\n=\nBeff\n1 \u2212 p\u03bd\n\nIf the original filling fraction is of the form \u03bd =\n\nm\nmp+1\n\n(5.4)\n\nwith m an integer, then we find\n\n\u03bdeff = m. The quantity p also contributes to the effective statistics of the electrons, which\nnow have p flux lines attached to them providing a phase of ei\u03c0p . Therefore if we want to\nretain Fermi statistics, p should be a (positive or negative) even integer. The net result is\nthat we now have a system of fermions in the reduced magnetic field exhibiting the integer\n\n\u2013 22 \u2013\n\n\fquantum Hall effect[22, 23]. The field \u03b1 is called the \"statistical gauge field\" for reasons\nwhich should be clear.\nThe next step in Ref.[8] is to replicate the above system over m different Landau\nlevels, with a Fermi field \u03c8I for each level. Then, introduce a new set of m gauge fields\naI\u03bc , I = 1, 2, * * * , m with a suitable Chern-Simons term that converts each fermion field\n\u03c8I to a boson \u03c6I . At this stage the Lagrangian is:\n\"\nm\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u00112\nX\n1 \u2020\u0010\n\u03c6\u2020I i \u22020 \u2212 i(A0 + \u03b10 + aI0 ) \u03c6I +\nL=\n\u03c6 \u2202i \u2212 i(Ai + \u03b1i + aIi ) \u03c6I\n2M I\nI=1\n#\n1\n1\n1\naI \u2227 daI + dA \u2227 \u2217dA +\n\u03b1 \u2227 d\u03b1\n\u2212 VI (\u03c6\u2020I \u03c6I ) +\n4\u03c0\n2\n4\u03c0p\n\n(5.5)\n\nwhere a potential VI (\u03c6\u2020I \u03c6I ) has been introduced to represent the interaction between electrons in the corresponding Landau level.\nFor simplicity let us set m = 1. Ignoring the physical electromagnetic field for the\nmoment, the gauge-field terms in the above Lagrangian are:\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u00112\n1 \u2020\u0010\nL = \u03c6\u2020 i \u22020 \u2212 i(\u03b10 + a0 ) \u03c6 +\n\u03c6 \u2202i \u2212 i(\u03b1i + ai ) \u03c6\n2M\n1\n1\n+\na \u2227 da +\n\u03b1 \u2227 d\u03b1\n4\u03c0\n4\u03c0p\n\n(5.6)\n\nThis looks something like the two-field system we analysed earlier, or rather a non-relativistic\nversion of it. With a Higgs vev, the mass matrix will acquire the form:\n!\n1 1\nmIJ \u223c\n1 1\n\n(5.7)\n\nThe physics now depends on the parameter p. If p is positive then the mass term can\nbe diagonalised, one eigenvalue is zero and the other nonzero, leading to one field remaining non-dynamical and the other being massive and propagating. If p is negative\nthen the Chern-Simons kinetic matrix has indefinite signature and the action is potentially\nnon-diagonalisable. In this case, after scaling fields so that the kinetic matrix becomes\ndiag(\u22121, 1) the mass matrix takes the form:\nmIJ \u223c\n\n1\np\n|p|\n\np\n\n!\n|p|\n\n|p|\n\n(5.8)\n\nFor any even p this always satisfies the constraint in Eq. (2.27) and therefore the Lagrangian\nis again diagonalisable and leads to the same spectrum. This is satisfying because in the\nFQHE system the physics does not appear to depend significantly on the sign of the ChernSimons terms, which are introduced for the sake of statistics.\n\n\u2013 23 \u2013\n\n\fIt remains to consider p = \u22121, a case that was not allowed in the FQHE context. Here\n\nwe indeed encounter the novel Higgs mechanism4 and the spectrum has a single propagating\n\nmassless mode. However we need to examine whether the analysis is valid in the presence of\nthe external gauge field A, which has a Maxwell kinetic term but mixes in the mass matrix\nwith both the Chern-Simons fields. The resulting theory actually resembles the 3-field case\nanalysed in Section 3.2, with the relabelling (B\u03bc , C\u03bc ) \u2192 (a\u03bc \u00b1 \u03b1\u03bc ) and D\u03bc \u2192 A\u03bc . With\nthis, the 3-field mass matrix in Eq. (3.3) becomes:\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8eb\n2 0 1\n\u03b1\u03bc\u03c1\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec \u03bc \u03b2 \u03bd \uf8f7 \u2192 \u223c v2 \uf8ec 0 0 0\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ed\n\u03c1 \u03bd \u03b3\n1 0 1\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n(5.9)\n\nso \u03bc = \u03bd = \u03b2 = 0. After eliminating B\u03bc , we find for the analogue of Eq. (3.6) the following\n\nmatrices (here we have taken account of the fact that the field A\u03bc has a Maxwell rather\nthan Chern-Simons kinetic term):\n!\n1\n0\n2\n2v\nYIJ =\n, kIJ =\n0 1\n\n0 \u2212 21\n\n\u2212 12\n\n0\n\n!\n\n,\n\nmIJ = v 2\n\n0 0\n0\n\n1\n2\n\n!\n\n(5.10)\n\nThe above matrices are written in the basis of fields (C\u03bc , A\u03bc ). In the absence of\nthe electromagnetic field A\u03bc we would retain only the top-left corner of these matrices\nand would find, as discussed above, that C\u03bc = a\u03bc \u2212 \u03b1\u03bc is a massless propagating field.\nHowever we now see that the presence of A\u03bc complicates the theory considerably. In fact,\n\nelimination of B\u03bc has induced a Chern-Simons term for the electromagnetic field A\u03bc and the\nChern-Simons kinetic matrix above is of Minkowski signature, so it cannot be diagonalised\nsimultaneously with the mass matrix. Matters are complicated by the presence of Maxwell\nterms for both fields, but if it can be justified to ignore them at long distances then we\nwould have a fresh novel Higgs mechanism leaving one combination of the electromagnetic\nfield A\u03bc and C\u03bc = a\u03bc \u2212 \u03b1\u03bc as a massless propagating field.\n\nThe purpose of this sub-section has not been to present and solve for a specific\n\ncondensed-matter system exhibiting NHM (in particular, recall that the discussion above\nwas carried out for p = \u22121 while p is supposed to be even in the given systems). Instead it has been pointed out that the kind of theories discussed in the context of the\nquantum Hall effect, and more generally theories in which vortices and unusual statistics\nplay an important role, do have multiple Chern-Simons terms and these can be mutually\nnon-diagonalisable with the mass terms, making them plausible settings for the NHM. The\nstudy of what precise physical effect this induces, and in which specific many-body system,\nis left for future work.\n4\n\nIn the present context, perhaps it is better called the \"novel Anderson-Higgs mechanism\"...\n\n\u2013 24 \u2013\n\n\f5.2 (2+1)d gravity\nIt is known[24, 25] that in 2+1 dimensions, gravity can be written as a difference-ChernSimons theory. One takes the variables to be the dreibein e\u03bca and \u03c9\u03bcab as is usual in the\nfirst-order formalism, and combines them into a pair of 1-forms:\nAa\u03bc =\n\n1 a\n1\n\u01eb bc \u03c9\u03bcbc + e\u03bca ,\n2\nl\n\n\u00c3a\u03bc =\n\n1 a\n1\n\u01eb bc \u03c9\u03bcbc \u2212 e\u03bca\n2\nl\n\n(5.11)\n\nwhere l is a constant with dimensions of length. Taking T a , a = 1, 2, 3 to be the generators\nof SL(2,R), normalised as tr(T a T b ) =\nL=\n\n1\n2\n\n\u03b7 ab , and defining A\u03bc = Aa\u03bc T a , the Lagrangian:\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\nl\ntr A \u2227 dA + 32 A \u2227 A \u2227 A \u2212 \u00c3 \u2227 d\u00c3 \u2212 23 \u00c3 \u2227 \u00c3 \u2227 \u00c3\n16\u03c0GN\n\n(5.12)\n\ncan be shown to be equivalent to ordinary Einstein gravity in (2+1)d with a negative\ncosmological constant \u039b = \u2212 l32 .\n\nExcept for the choice of a specific non-compact gauge group, SL(2,R), this is identical\n\nto the Lagrangian Eq. (4.1) that we discussed in Section 4.1. It is also natural to write this\naction in the form of Eq. (4.4) because the fields B\u03bc , C\u03bc defined there are, in the present\ncase:\n\n1\nB\u03bca = e\u03bca ,\nl\n\nC\u03bca =\n\n1 a\n\u01eb \u03c9 bc\n2 bc \u03bc\n\n(5.13)\n\nThis gives a nice physical interpretation in the context of gravity, to the fields B\u03bc , C\u03bc of\nSection 4.1.\n1\nl\n\nWe also see that in terms of these fields, the terms B \u2227 dC and B \u2227 C \u2227 C are of order\n\nwhile the term B \u2227 B \u2227 B is of order\n\nleads to the pure B \u2227\n\nF (C)\n\n1\n.\nl3\n\nThus the limit l \u2192 \u221e is easily taken and\n\nLagrangian Eq. (4.27) of Sec. 4.2, with now B\u03bca = e\u03bca since\n\nthe l-dependence has cancelled against the coefficient of the Lagrangian. This Lagrangian\ntherefore corresponds to (2+1)d gravity in the absence of a cosmological constant.\nIt is worth remarking that there is a beautiful generalisation of the above structure\nto the case of higher-spin fields[26, 27]. Here the 1-forms in Eq. (5.11) are generalised to\ninclude the corresponding quantities describing one or more higher-spin fields. With this\ngeneralisation all the above formulae carry over identically.\nIt remains to ask whether there is a novel Higgs mechanism in this system. This would\nrequire a mass term: \u223c \u2212tr(B\u03bc B \u03bc ) = \u2212 12 \u03b7 \u03bc\u03bd \u03b7ab e\u03bca e\u03bdb which is of course not generally\n\ncovariant. In fact, in the Chern-Simons formulation general covariance is replaced by\nSL(2,R) \u00d7 SL(2,R) gauge invariance, and a mass term will not be gauge-invariant, so this\n\nis not necessarily a surprise. However, an additional problem is that the metric \u03b7ab of\nSL(2,R) has Lorentzian signature so the above \"mass term\" for e\u03bca has wrong signs for\nsome components (in our metric, the right sign would be negative for spacelike values of\n\n\u2013 25 \u2013\n\n\f\u03bc, but here we get positive signs when \u03bc is spacelike and a is timelike). Finally, if such a\nterm were nevertheless generated and formally used to integrate out e\u03bca , the result would\nbe SL(2,R) Yang-Mills theory which by itself continues to be plagued with sign issues.\nIt is still (barely) conceivable that a mass term for e\u03bca is generated along just one\n(spacelike) direction of SL(2,R). This would Higgs a U(1) \u00d7 U(1) part of the Chern-\n\nSimons action and lead to a Maxwell kinetic term. We leave this possibility for a future\ninvestigation.\n\nAcknowledgements\nI would like to thank Guillaume Bossard, Kedar Damle, Bobby Ezhuthachan, Rajesh\nGopakumar, Kimyeong Lee, Shiraz Minwalla, Nitin Nitsure, Costis Papageorgakis, David\nTong and particularly Nemani Suryanarayana for helpful discussions.
