In addition to ultrafast\nmagnetic field pulses which require complex devices for\ntheir generation, the spin dynamics has been induced by\nultrafast optical laser pulses. Recent experiments have\nshown that significant demagnetization of magnetic compounds can be measured on the scale of a few hundred\nfemtoseconds.1,2,3,4 Typically the light is absorbed by the\nmaterial, giving rise to a rapid increase of temperature\nresponsible for the change of magnetization5,6,7 and spin\nreorientation.8 The question concerning the exact speed\nof the initial sub-picosecond magnetization breakdown is\nstill subject of debate and partly relates to the question\nof how to interpret magneto-optical experiments.4,9,10\nFurthermore, the cooling time could limit the repetition frequency whose value is fundamental for actual\napplications.11\nRecently, non-thermal ultrafast optical control of magnetization has been achieved in canted antiferromagnet\nsamples of dysprosium orthoferrites by using circularly\npolarized femtosecond pulses.12 Via the inverse Faraday\neffect, the light excitation acts on the spins of the system\nas a magnetic field pulse directed along the wave vector of the radiation and proportional to its intensity.13,14\nThe inverse Faraday effect does not rely on absorption\nand has its fingerprint in the fact that the helicity of the\npump controls the sign of the photo-induced magneti-\n\nzation. This effect plays a role also in the femtosecond\nphotomagnetic switching of spins in ferromagnetic garnet\nfilms.15\nSince the manipulation of spins by means of circularly\npolarized laser pulses represents an advance in the field\nof ultrafast magnetization dynamics, we analyze thoroughly the experimental work by Kimel et al.12 and discuss its pecularities. In this experiment the difference\nbetween the Faraday rotations induced by right- and lefthanded polarized pulses has been studied in the temperature range between 20 K and 175 K. A characteristic spin-wave mode, called quasi-antiferro mode, is excited by the light pulse along the z-direction. When\nthe sample is heated, the frequency of the mode oscillations increases and the amplitude decreases from the\nlow-temperature maximum value of the order of MS /16,\nwhere MS is the saturation magnetization. We point out\nthat there is no theoretical explanation concerning the\nmagnitude and the temperature behavior of the oscillations. Furthermore, some aspects of the cited experiment\ndeserve attention. Actually, in the so called \u03934 phase,\nstable at temperatures higher than 50 K, the oscillations\nhave temperature-dependent frequencies in full agreement with those measured by Raman experiments.16,17\nOn the other hand, at temperatures below 50 K, the frequency of the photoinduced magnetization stays constant\nin contrast with the results of the Raman spectra and\nother measurements which signal the discontinuous transition to another phase, called \u03931 . Therefore, the experimental data obtained by laser pulses reflect the excitation\nof resonance modes characteristic of the \u03934 phase even at\nvery low temperatures. Finally, the field pulse is also directed along the x-axis: another spin-wave mode, called\n\n\f2\nquasi-ferro mode, is excited and is characterized by an\nextraordinarily, not well understood, small amplitude.\nIn order to obtain a deeper understanding of the nonthermal control of magnetization, in this paper we perform simulations related to the experiment by Kimel et\nal.12 We have studied the magnetization dynamics employing a model for orthoferrites that was previously proposed for the analysis of resonance and high-frequency\nsusceptibility.18 The parameters of the free energy, such\nas the symmetric and antisymmetric exchange, and the\nanisotropy constants, are determined by using the experimental Raman spectra of Ref.17. The dynamical behavior is described by solving two coupled sublattice nonlinear Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equations through a fifthorder Runge-Kutta algorithm. The damping term in the\ndynamical equations is related to magnon-magnon interaction and its temperature behavior is provided by a calculation of the scattering rate in orthoferrites.22 Exploiting the inverse Faraday effect, we have analyzed the effect of Gaussian magnetic field pulses whose time width\nis of the order of hundred femtoseconds. Since, in the\nregime considered in the experiments, the effective magnetic fields are not large if compared with exchange fields,\nthe solution of the linearized system represents a reasonable approximation to the numerical results. Therefore\nwe have studied the dynamics within the linear solution\nafter the excitation by a pulse shaped as a delta function,\nsince the magnetic field pulse takes place on a time scale\nshorter than the period of the resonance modes.\nOne result of this work is that, in the \u03934 phase, the\nquasi-antiferro mode of the magnetization is excited by a\nfield pulse along the z-axis and the oscillations have amplitudes in agreement with experimental results. Moreover, the oscillations induced by pulses directed along the\nz and -z axis show the characteristic out-of-phase behavior. We point out that, even for the dynamics, the ratio\nbetween the antisymmetric and symmetric exchange energies is important. Furthermore, we stress that in the\ncanted antiferromagnets, such as rare-earth orthoferrites,\nthe largest amplitudes of the oscillation are not obtained\nfor the ferromagnetic sum vector of the sublattice magnetizations but for the antiferromagnetic difference vector. The behavior of the magnetization has been analyzed in the temperature range between 20 K and 175\nK. The damping process based on magnon-magnon scattering describes the decay of the oscillations with results\nconsistent with the experiment.\nThe case of the field pulse directed along the x-axis has\nbeen analyzed in the \u03934 phase. The magnetization along\nthe x-axis oscillates with the frequency of the quasi-ferro\nmode as found in the experiment. However, the calculated and the experimental amplitudes of the oscillation\nare different if the magnetic field pulse along the x-axis\nhas the same intensity of that along the z-axis. Therefore,\nin the comparison with experimental data, we discuss the\nrole of anisotropies between z and x directions as a source\nof discrepancy between theory and experiment.\nFinally, we consider the actual stable phase in equi-\n\nlibrium at low temperatures, the \u03931 phase, and its resonance modes. We point out that the difference in energy\nbetween the \u03931 and \u03934 can be very small, so that even\na small laser-heating effect could be responsible for the\nstabilization of the \u03934 phase at very low temperatures on\na picosecond time scale.\nThe outline of this paper is as follows. In the next\nsection we discuss the numerical approach for the system and the analytic solution of the linearized equations\nfor excitation by a delta function shaped magnetic field\npulse. Section III provides the numerical and analytical\nresults: in the first and second subsection the excitation\ndue to the pulses along the z-axis and x-axis, respectively,\nis analyzed when the system at equilibrium is in the \u03934\nphase. In the final subsection the effect on the dynamics\nof a \u03931 phase stable at low temperatures is considered.\nSection IV provides a summary.\n\nII.\n\nFREE ENERGY AND DYNAMICAL\nEQUATIONS\n\nRare-earth orthoferrites are represented by the formula\nReF eO3 , where Re stands for rare-earth. They have a\nperovskite-type structure with slight deformation from\ncubic to orthorombic. In many of them the spins of iron\nions are antiferromagnetically aligned through a strong\nsuper-exchange interaction with a N\u00e8el transition temperature of about 700K. Moreover, promoted by the orthorombic deformation, an antisymmetric exchange interaction acts between iron spins, resulting in spin canted\nmagnetism with a feeble saturation moment. In the case\nof dysprosium orthoferrites, the temperature dependence\nof the ferromagnetic moment is characterized by a steep\nrise around 50 K in coincidence with the stabilization\nof the \u03934 phase.19 Actually these compounds are also\nknown for their spin reorientation properties: continuous rotational-type (ferromagnetism present in the lowtemperature phase) and, only for dysprosium, abrupttype from \u03931 (antiferromagnetic) to \u03934 with increasing\ntemperature.\nWe use the free energy and the dynamical equations\nproposed in a previous work and focus on the behavior\nof the magnetization in the \u03934 phase.18 The static and\ndynamical behavior is studied within the two-sublattice\nmodel for iron spins that takes into account the two active resonance modes. This represents an excellent approximation since the remaining resonance modes are almost inactive, and their interaction with active modes is\nnegligible. In Fig.1 we show a schematic representation\nof equilibrium positions of two-sublattice magnetization\nvectors for dysprosium orthoferrites.17\nThe normalized free energy V = F/M0 , with M0 the\nmodulus of the sublattice magnetization, is composed of\na part Vexc due to exchange interactions and a part Vani\ndue to the anisotropy:\nV = Vexc + Vani .\n\n(1)\n\n\f3\n\nM1\n\n\u03b20\n\n~ 1 and M\n~ 2 represents\nThe equilibrium position of M\na stationary solution of the nonlinear Landau-LifshitzGilbert equations\n\nY\n\nX\n\n\u03934\n\nM1\n\n\u03931\n\nMS\n\nM2\n\nFIG. 1: The equilibrium positions of sublattice magnetization\nvectors for the high-temperature \u03934 (ferromagnetic) and lowtemperature \u03931 (antiferromagnetic) phases. Due to the ratio between the antisymmetric D and symmetric E exchange\nfields, the angle \u03b20 is actually very small.\n\nThe free energy is expanded as a power series in the magnetization components and, in order to properly describe\nthe \u03934 phase, only quadratic terms are sufficient. The\nexchange energy is written as the sum of a scalar and a\npseudo-vector part\n~1 * R\n~ 2 + D(X1 Z2 \u2212 X2 Z1 ),\nVexc = E R\n\n(2)\n\nwhere E and D are the symmetric and antisymmetric ex~1 = M\n~ 1 /M0 \u2261 (X1 , Y1 , Z1 ),\nchange fields, respectively, R\n~2 = M\n~ 2 /M0 \u2261 (X2 , Y2 , Z2 ). The anisotropic enand R\nergy is\nVani = \u2212Axx (X12 + X22 ) \u2212 Azz (Z12 + Z22 ).\n\n(3)\n\nThe exchange field E is quite large compared to the other\nterms. It is related to the exchange spin-spin interaction\nJ via the equation E = 12JS/g\u03bcB , with S = 5/2 the spin\nof iron ions, g = 2, and \u03bcB the Bohr magneton. Since J\nis of the order of 20 cm\u22121 , E is approximately 6.4 \u00d7 106\nOe.17 The field D is related to the antisymmetrical exchange energy d through the relation D = 6dS/g\u03bcB and\nis of the order of 1.4 \u00d7 105 Oe (d is about 0.88 cm\u22121 ).\nThe anisotropy constants Axx and Azz depend on temperature and are of the order of hundreds of Oersted.\nUsing the energy given in Eq.(1), the equilibrium position can be derived for the \u03934 phase. This is shown in\nFig. 1, where the small canting angle \u03b20 is determined\nby the equation\ntan(2\u03b20 ) =\n\n(5)\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\n~2\n~\n1 dR\n~\n~ 2 V + \u03b1R\n~ 2 \u2227 dR2 ,\n~ 2 \u2227 H(t)\n\u2212\u2207\n= \u2212R\n\u03b3 dt\ndt\n\n(6)\n\nX\n\nZ\n\nM2\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\n~1\n~\n1 dR\n~ 1 \u2227 H(t)\n~\n~ 1 V + \u03b1R\n~ 1 \u2227 dR1\n= \u2212R\n\u2212\u2207\n\u03b3 dt\ndt\n\nD\nD\n\u2243\n= 0.022.\nE + Axx \u2212 Azz\nE\n\n(4)\n\n~1 + M\n~ 2| =\nHence the magnetization MS = |M\n2M0 sin(\u03b20 ) \u223c 0.022M0 is two orders of magnitude less\nthan M0 .\n\n~ 1 and\nwhere \u03b3 = 17.6 MHz/Oe is the gyroscopic ratio, \u2207\n~\n~\n~\n\u22072 are gradients with respect to R1 and R2 , respectively,\nand V is the energy in Eq.(1). Clearly the dynamical\nequations satisfy the following constraints: X12 + Y12 +\nZ12 = 1 and X22 + Y22 + Z22 = 1.\n~\nThe quantity H(t)\nin Eqs.(5,6) is the time-dependent\nmagnetic field simulating the effect of laser pulses due to\nthe inverse Faraday effect. In the experiment by Kimel et\nal.12 the magnetic field pulse is of the order of fractions\nof Tesla with time width of hundred femtoseconds. In the\nnumerical simulations we consider a pulse directed along\nthe propagation direction of the light with a Gaussian\nshape\n\u0003\n\u0002\nF0\n~\nH(t)\n= k\u0302 \u221a\nexp \u2212(t/\u03c4p )2 ,\n\u03c0\u03c4p\n\n(7)\n\nwhere k\u0302 defines the direction of the light wave-vector and\n\u03c4p indicates approximately the duration of the pulse.20\nFinally, in Eqs.(5,6) \u03b1 is the Gilbert constant. Actually, \u03b1 takes into account the damping of the oscillations\ndue to the magnon-magnon scattering and to the interaction of magnons with dysprosium spins and phonons. We\nnotice that the scattering via dysprosium spins should\nbe larger at very low temperatures where dysprosium\nions tend to order. Moreover, the phonon-magnon scattering should be effective only on the nanosecond time\nscale.15,21 It is the magnon-magnon interaction that provides the preminent source of scattering on the picosecond time scale.\nA.\n\nSolution of linearized system\n\nIn this subsection we consider the solution determined\nby linearizing Eqs.(5,6) and study the excitation of this\nlinear system due to a magnetic field pulse shaped as a\ndelta function. This is reasonable since, in the regime\nconsidered in the experiments, the effective magnetic\nfields are not large if compared with exchange fields, and\nthe temporal width of the pulse is much smaller than the\nperiods of the resonance modes.\nIn order to take into account small deviations from\nthe equilibrium, the standard approach is to consider two separate coordinate systems, (S1 ,T1 ,Y1 ) and\n~ 1 and M\n~ 2,\n(S2 ,T2 ,Y2 ), which describe the dynamics of M\n\n\f4\nrespectively.18 The variables S1 and S2 are chosen in or~ 1 and\nder to coincide with the equilibrium positions of M\n~ 2 , respectively, so that\nM\nS1 = sin(\u03b20 )Z1 + cos(\u03b20 )X1 ,\nT1 = \u2212 cos(\u03b20 )Z1 + sin(\u03b20 )X1 ,\n\n(8)\n(9)\n\nS2 = sin(\u03b20 )Z2 \u2212 cos(\u03b20 )X2 ,\nT1 = cos(\u03b20 )Z2 + sin(\u03b20 )X2 .\n\n(10)\n(11)\n\nand\n\nBy linearizing the system, we obtain the frequencies of\ntwo modes, the quasi-antiferro \u03c9AF M and the quasi-ferro\n\u03c9F M modes, involving cooperative motions of spins of\nthe two sublattices. The energy of the quasi-antiferro\nand quasi-ferro modes is of the order of several cm\u22121 .\nThe first mode is characterized by the frequency\n2\n\u03c9AF\nM\n= 4EAxx + 4Axx (Axx \u2212 Azz ) + D2 .\n\u03b32\n\n(12)\n\nThe dynamic in this mode shows the following behavior: \u2206X1 (t) = \u2212\u2206X2 (t), \u2206Y1 (t) = \u2212\u2206Y2 (t) and\n\u2206Z1 (t) = \u2206Z2 (t), where \u2206Wi (t) = Wi (t) \u2212 Wieq , with\nW = X, Y, Z, i = 1, 2, and Wieq corresponding to the\nequilibrium position shown in Fig.1. Thus, the only ferromagnetic component different from zero is the magnetization along the z-axis with respect to the equilibrium,\n\u2206MZ = M0 \u2206M\u0303Z , where \u2206M\u0303Z is defined by\n\u2206M\u0303Z = \u2206Z1 (t) + \u2206Z2 (t) = Z1 (t) + Z2 (t) \u2212 (Z1eq + Z2eq ).\n(13)\nSince the net spin does not reflect the motions of the sublattice spins, this mode is called quasi-antiferromagnetic.\nThe second mode, with frequency\n\u03c9F2 M\n= 4E(Axx \u2212 Azz ) + 4Axx (Axx \u2212 Azz ),\n\u03b32\n\ndamping constant in the dynamical equations (5,6). Indeed, if \u03c90 is the temperature-dependent frequency of one\nof the modes, the damping constant \u03b1 could be related\nto the damping rate 1/\u03c40 by the relation 1/\u03c40 = \u03c90 \u03b1. At\nthe picosecond scale, the dominant spin-wave damping\nis due to four-magnon scattering. By using many-body\nperturbation theory, the rate for spin-wave at zero wavevector is estimated to be 1/\u03c40 \u223c 2.66 * 104 T 2 s\u22121 , with T\ntemperature in units of Kelvin degrees.22 The scattering\nrate grows quadratically in temperature, while the frequency of the quasi-antiferro mode is an increasing linear\nfunction of the temperature.17 The quantity \u03b1 gets larger\nwith temperature since the most important contribution\nis given by 1/\u03c40 . Actually, the values of \u03b1 corresponding\nto the quasi-antiferro mode range from about 0.4 * 10\u22124\nat T=50 K to 3 * 10\u22124 at T=200 K. The smallness of \u03b1\nimplies that the oscillations of the magnetization are not\nstrongly damped.\nIt is useful to consider a magnetic field pulse shaped\nas a delta function\n~\nH(t)\n= k\u0302F0 \u03b4(t).\n\n(15)\n\nSince the pulse is instantaneous, it provides an initial\ncondition to the dynamics described by the linearized\nequations of motions. We have analyzed two cases: field\nalong z- and x-axis, since these are prominent for the\nexperiment that we want to discuss.\nFor the field along the z-axis, starting from the equilibrium position at t = 0\u2212 , we find at t = 0+\n\u2206X1 (0+ ) = \u2212\u2206X2 (0+ ) = cos(\u03b20 )[cos(\u03b3F0 ) \u2212 1](16)\n\u2206Y1 (0+ ) = \u2212\u2206Y2 (0+ ) = cos(\u03b20 ) sin(\u03b3F0 )\n(17)\n\u2206Z1 (0+ ) = \u2206Z2 (0+ ) = 0.\n(18)\nTherefore this pulse will excite only the quasi-antiferro\nmode.\nThe field along the x-axis yields at t = 0+\n\n(14)\n\nis characterized by \u2206X1 (t) = \u2206X2 (t), \u2206Y1 (t) = \u2206Y2 (t)\nand \u2206Z1 (t) = \u2212\u2206Z2 (t). Since the net spin executes the\nsame rocking behavior as the sublattice spins, this mode\nis called quasi-ferromagnetic.\nEqs.(12,14) relate the mode frequencies to the model\nparameters. The exchange fields are assumed constant\nin temperature at the values given above, since they represent the highest energy scales. Using Eqs.(12,14) and\nthe experimentally measured Raman spectra of Ref.17,\nwe derive the anisotropy parameters. The quasi-antiferro\nmode increases linearly as a function of temperature in\nthe \u03934 phase: from 150 GHz at 50 K to 450 GHz at about\n200 K, while the quasi-ferro mode stays constant at about\n375 GHz. Therefore the anisotropic terms change upon\nheating the sample: Axx varies from about -640 Oe at\nT=50 K to about 200 Oe at T=200 K, Azz from -1540 Oe\nto -700 Oe in the same temperature range, with approximately fixed Axx \u2212 Azz = 900 Oe. The knowledge of the\nfrequencies is important also to determine the value of the\n\n\u2206X1 (0+ ) = \u2206X2 (0+ ) = 0\n(19)\n\u2206Y1 (0+ ) = \u2206Y2 (0+ ) = \u2212 sin(\u03b20 ) sin(\u03b3F0 )\n(20)\n+\n+\n\u2206Z1 (0 ) = \u2212\u2206Z2 (0 ) = sin(\u03b20 )[cos(\u03b3F0 ) \u2212 1].(21)\nThus the system will be excited in the quasi-ferro mode.\nAs the experimental field magnitude is lower than the\nexchange fields, we study the subsequent dynamical evolution within the linear approximation.18 Within a relaxation time approximation, we include the damping time \u03c4\ndescribing the decay towards the equilibrium position.23\nFrom the solution of the linear system in the case of a\npulse along the z-axis, we get the evolution of the quasiantiferro mode.

The components of the magnetization different from zero are those along x- and yaxis. In particular we consider the magnetization along\nx-axis (with respect to equilibrium), \u2206MX = M0 \u2206M\u0303X ,\nwhere \u2206M\u0303X is defined as\n\u2206M\u0303X = \u2206X1 (t) + \u2206X2 (t).\n\n(28)\n\nFrom the linearized dynamical equations this quantity is\ncalculated as\nr\n4E\n\u2212t/\u03c4\nsin2 (\u03b20 ) sin(\u03b3F0 ) sin(\u03c9F M t).\n\u2206M\u0303X = e\nAxx \u2212 Azz\n(29)\nIII.\n\nNUMERICAL AND ANALYTICAL\nRESULTS\n\nUsing the procedure outlined in the previous section,\nall the parameters appearing in the dynamical equations (5,6) can be determined. These nonlinear equations are numerically integrated through a fifth-order\n\nRunge-Kutta algorithm.24 The experimental laser pulses\nalong the z-axis are estimated to be equivalent to magnetic fields with an amplitude of 0.3 T and a full-width\nat half-maximum of about 200 fs.12 Therefore, we consider Gaussian\nfields of the form given in Eq.(7), with\n\u221a\nF0 = \u03c0\u03c4p Amp(H), \u03c4p = 200 fs and Amp(H) typically\n3000 Oe. This value of the effective field is small when\ncompared with the exchange fields, so that effects due\nto the nonlinearity of the equations are negligible. Since\nthe time width of the pulse is small on the scale of the\nmode periods, the results are not strongly dependent on\n\u03c4p . The linear solution with a delta pulse represents a\ngood approximation, provides the right orders of magnitude but does not reproduce exactly the numerical results. Therefore, in all the following figures we plot the\nresults obtained by the numerical integration.\nIn the first and second subsections we discuss the effects of a Gaussian pulse along z and x directions, respectively, when the system at equilibrium is in the \u03934 phase.\nIn the final one we briefly analyze the resonance modes\nand magnetization dynamics if the \u03931 phase is stable at\nlow temperatures.\n\nA.\n\nPulse along z-direction\n\nAs illustrated in Ref. 12, pulses along the z and z directions excite the quasi-antiferro mode. Using the\nnumerical procedure discussed in the preceding section,\nwe have calculated the oscillating behavior of the ferromagnetic vector along z focusing on \u2206MZ at T = 95\nK. As shown in Fig.2(a), the magnetization has a sinelike behavior with weak damping on a picosecond scale.\nIn addition, opposite fields give rise to out-of-phase oscillations in agreement with the experimental data. We\nnotice that after 50 picoseconds the amplitude is about\nhalf of the initial one, a value that is compatible with results reported in Fig.1 of Ref.12. This suggests that the\ndamping term associated to magnon-magnon scattering\nprovides a reasonable description of the reduction of the\namplitude as a function of temperature.\nComparing the experimental data shown in Fig.1 of\nRef.12 with the theoretical results shown in Fig.2(a) of\nthis paper, we point out similarities and differences. Indeed, on the scale of the initial pulse width, there is a\nstrong enhancement of the experimental Faraday rotation, probably due to the interference between pump and\nprobe pulses. After this transient the oscillations induced\nby pulses with opposite helicities show similar amplitudes\nin time. In contrast with theoretical results, the equilibrium point of the Faraday rotations shows a decay and\nits behavior is different for left- and right-handed polarized pulses. Only later the oscillations tend toward\na common equilibrium point that is different, however,\nfrom that before the pulse excitation. If the shift of\nthe equilibrium positions is caused by a change of the\nanisotropy constants due to an intrinsic photomagnetic\neffect, then the amplitude of the oscillations should be\n\n\f6\n\n0.0\n-0.1\n-0.2\nAmp(H ) = - 3000 Oe\nz\n\n-0.3\n\nAmp(H ) =\n\n3000 Oe\n\n30\n\n40\n\nz\n\n-0.4\n\n(a)\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\nt (ps)\n\n50\n\nT=95 K\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n\n-0.2\n\nAmp(Hz\u00b1) = \u00b1 3000 Oe\n\n-0.4\n\n(b)\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\nt (ps)\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n(31)\n\nwith R given in Eq.(27). The amplitude is determined\nby the term R depending on the model parameters and\nby sin(\u03b3F0 ) related to the pulse intensity. Using the experimental data, the impulse F0 is estimated to be of the\norder of 3000 \u00d7 400 Oe*fs. This implies that \u03b3F0 is of\nthe same order as the angle \u03b20 responsible for the canted\nantiferromagnetism: sin(\u03b3F0 ) \u223c \u03b3F0 \u223c 2\u03b20 . Thus, we\nhave\n\u2206MZ /MS \u2243 2R sin(\u03c9AF M t).\n\n0.1\n\n(30)\n\nwith H+ and H\u2212 indicating positive and negative amplitudes, respectively. As reported in the experimental\nwork,12 this quantity is less dependent on initial effects.\nJust after the transient induced by the pulse, this quantity has an amplitude of the order of MS /16, in close\nagreement with the calculated data reported in Fig. 2(b).\nIt is worthwhile understanding the order of magnitude\nof this amplitude by exploiting the result of the previous\nsection for the delta pulse. From Eq.(22) we get for short\ntimes (t \u226a \u03c42 )\n\u2206MZ \u2243 2M0 R sin(\u03b3F0 ) sin(\u03c9AF M t),\n\nT=95 K\n\n0.2\n\n16 d(\u2206Mz)/Ms\n\nd(\u2206MZ ) = \u2206MZ (H+) \u2212 \u2206MZ (H\u2212),\n\n0.3\n\n16 \u2206\u039cz /Ms\n\ndifferent for the two helicities, as reported in a recent\nexperiment.15 Since this is not the case in dysprosium\northoferrites, the change in the orientation equilibrium\nis more probably associated with a small but unavoidable laser-heating effect. Actually, within the model proposed in this paper, a shift of the equilibrium configuration could in principle be caused by the magnetic pulse\nduring the excitation.18 This shift is negligible, however,\nsince the amplitude of the effective magnetic field is much\nsmaller than the antisymmetrical exchange field D. Only\nby enhancing the amplitude of the pulse to values comparable to D, the shift becomes important, and, upon\nfurther increase, even a precessional switching can occur.\nThese amplitudes imply very high light intensities that\nare probably above the damage threshold of the samples.\nIn Fig. 2(b) we focus on the related quantity d(\u2206MZ ),\ndefined as\n\n(32)\n\nIf we consider R \u2243 D/2E, we obtain the order of magnitude 16d(\u2206MZ )/MS \u223c 16 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 0.02 = 0.64 not so far\nfrom the experiment. Hence the ratio D/E is fundamental not only for the equilibrium configuration, but also\nfor the magnetization dynamics in the canted antiferromagnet.\nWithin the theoretical approach, the dynamics of the\nantiferromagnetic vectors can be easily obtained, but\nthese quantities have not been measured in the experimental work.12 Due to the fact that the equilibrium position corresponds to a maximum of AX = M0 (X1 \u2212 X2 ),\nthe temporal evolution of \u2206AX = M0 \u2206\u00c3X , with \u2206\u00c3X\ndefined in Eq.(23), is characterized by a very small amplitude. From Eq.(25) one can deduce that the amplitude\nof \u2206AX should be at least an order of magnitude smaller\nthan that of \u2206MZ .\n\nFIG. 2: (a) The variation \u2206MZ of the magnetization along\nz-axis with respect to the equilibrium value in units of MS /16\nas a function of time for two opposite amplitudes. (b) The\ndifference d(\u2206MZ ) in units of MS /16 between the magnetizations obtained upon excitation by opposite fields along\nz-direction as function of time. The dashed line includes the\neffect of the anisotropy that will be introduced in the next\nsubsection.\n\nIn Fig. 3 we show the results of the numerical calculation for the quantity \u2206AY = M0 \u2206\u00c3Y , where \u2206\u00c3Y is\ndefined in Eq.(24). We point out that now the amplitude\nis an order of magnitude larger than that of \u2206MZ and\nthe response is more sensitive to the pulse. Actually this\nis due to the fact that the dynamics of the components\nalong the y-axis is strongly influenced by the highest energy scale E.18 From Eq.(26) we obtain a rough estimate\nfor short times (t \u226a \u03c42 )\n\u2206AY \u2243 2M0 sin(\u03b3F0 ) cos(\u03c9AF M t).\n\n(33)\n\nTherefore the amplitude is 2 sin(\u03b3F0 )M0 \u223c 2\u03b20 M0 \u223c\n0.022M0 = MS . Finally, we notice that, after 50 picoseconds, the damping acts in the same way as for the\nferromagnetic vector along the z-direction, causing a reduction of about half of the initial amplitude.\nIn order to make contact to the experimental measurements, it is interesting to analyze the behavior of the\n\n\f7\n\n0.04\n\n6\n\nAmp(Hz) = 3000 Oe\n\nT=175 K\n\nAmp(Hz) = - 3000 Oe\n\n0.03\n\n5\n\nT=155 K\n\n0.02\n3\n\nd (\u2206Mz)/M0 ( 10 )\n\n4\n\n\u2206Ay/M0\n\n0.01\n0.00\n-0.01\n\nT=135 K\n3\n\nT=95 K\n2\n\nT=75 K\n1\n\n-0.02\n\nT=60 K\n\n-0.03\n\n0\n\nT= 95 K\n\nAmp(Hz\u00b1) = \u00b1 3000 Oe\n\n-0.04\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n0\n\n50\n\nFIG. 3: The variation of the antiferromagnetic vector along\ny-axis \u2206AY with respect to M0 as a function of time for two\nopposite amplitudes.\n\nmagnetization dynamics at different temperatures. As\nreported in Fig.3 of the paper by Kimel et al.,12 upon\nheating the sample, the frequency of the oscillations increases and the amplitude decreases. The oscillations\nhave temperature-dependent frequencies that are very\nclose to those measured by Raman experiments at temperatures higher than 50 K. In Fig.4 of this paper the\ncalculated d(\u2206MZ ) is shown. We find agreement with\nexperimental decay of amplitudes and behavior of the\nfrequency upon increasing the temperature for times after the transient. Within the theoretical approach, the\ntemperature dependence of the anisotropy constants Axx\nand Azz affects the frequency of the modes, but is not\nso important in the change of the amplitude after the\nlaser transient. The decrease of the magnetization seen\nat a fixed time (of the order of tens of picoseconds) for\ndifferent temperatures is dominated by the increase of\nthe damping constant \u03b1 in temperature. Due to the\nagreement with experiment, the estimate of the damping constant derived on the basis of the magnon-magnon\nscattering is reliable.\nThe results of Fig.4 show the magnetization normalized by the sublattice magnetization modulus M0 . We\npoint out that, in principle, M0 can vary as function of\ntemperature. However, the inclusion of the temperature\ndependence of M0 = Mz /(2 sin(\u03b20 )) is not easy, since\nonly the magnetization Mz is typically experimentally\navailable. In any case, even if the angle \u03b20 is assumed\nfixed, the change of Mz is small in the considered temperature range.19\nBefore closing this section, we focus on the dependence\nof the magnetic response on the amplitude of the pulse.\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\nt (ps)\n\nt (ps)\n\nFIG. 4: The difference between the magnetizations along z\nfor opposite fields as a function of temperature. Every new\ncurve is shifted from the previous one along the vertical axis\nover 1.\n\nAs inferred by Eq.(31), for the effective magnetic pulses\nused in the experiments, the ferromagnetic vector is proportional to F0 , i.e., to the intensity of the light pulse\nused in the inverse Faraday effect. In Fig.5 we plot the\nnumerical results for the amplitude of the magnetization\nat t=40 ps, i.e., after about 10 periods as in the experimental data.25 We find the expected linear behavior as\na function of the amplitude of the pulse. The value obtained at 5 T for T = 60 K is not far from unity. Thus,\nthe saturation of the magnetization along z is reached for\nthis high intensity, in agreement with the extrapolation\nof the experimental data in the inset of Fig.2 of Ref.12.\nSummarizing, in this subsection we have focused on the\nmagnetization dynamics in the \u03934 phase when the field\npulse is directed along the z-axis. We have analyzed the\namplitude and the decay of the oscillations as a function\nof temperature finding agreement with experimental data\nfor times longer than the initial transient. Actually, on\nthe time scale of the initial pulse width, discrepancies\nwith experiments appear. These could be due to a small\nbut unavoidable laser-heating effect that is not included\nin the present theoretical approach.\n\nB.\n\nPulse along x-direction: role of anisotropy\n\nIn this subsection we analyze the effects of the excitation due to the pulse along the x-axis.\nThe fields along the x-direction excite another mode.\nAs shown in Eq.(29), \u2206M\u0303X oscillates with the frequency\nof the quasi-ferro mode in agreement with experiment.\n\n\f8\n\n0.8\n0.7\n\nd (\u2206Mz)/MS\n\n0.6\n\nt=40 ps\n\n0.5\n\nAmp(Mx) / Amp(Mz)\n\n1.0\n\nT=60K\nT=95K\nT=135K\nT=175K\n\n0.03\n\nAmp(Hz) = - 3000 Oe\n\n0.8\n\n0.02\n\n0.4\n\nAmp(Hx) = - 3000 Oe\n\u2206Mx/MS\n\n0.6\n60\n\n0.3\n\n90\n\n\u2206Mz/MS\n\n120\n\nT (K)\n\nT=60 K\n\n0.01\n\n0.2\n0.1\n\n0.00\n\n0.0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n4\n\nAmp(Hz) (10 Oe)\n-0.01\n\nFIG. 5: Amplitude of the spin oscillations as a function of the\namplitude of the magnetic field pulse for different temperatures.\n\nOn the other hand, the magnitude of the magnetic response along x is of the same order as that obtained\nalong the z-axis with a pulse of equal amplitude. Even\nif the torque exerted by the field along x is tiny, the\nsubsequent temporal evolution, in particular, that of the\nvariables T1 and T2 , is able to give a non-negligible amplitude to the response along x. This is in discrepancy\nwith the experimental results which show that the Faraday rotation along x is at least an order of magnitude\nsmaller than that along the z-axis.12 Also, as shown in\nFig.3 of Ref.12, it does not show any temperature dependence following the behavior of the frequency of the\nquasi-ferro mode, in striking contrast with the case of a\npulse along the z-axis.\nIn order to properly compare the experimental and\ntheoretical results, we should take into account several\neffects in orthoferrites.26 First of all, the experimental\nestimate of the effective magnetic field pulse due to the\ninverse Faraday effect is available only when the pulse\nis along the z-axis. Moreover, it is well known that\nin rare-earth orthoferrites optical birefringence is not\nnegligible.27,28 Therefore the experimental Faraday rotations along the z- and x-axis can be different, even if\nthe oscillations of the magnetizations are of the same order. Since the Faraday rotation along the x direction is\nvery small in comparison with that along the z-axis, part\nof the effect could be also associated with the anisotropy\nof the magneto-optical susceptibility. Indeed, the effective magnetic field generated via the inverse Faraday effect can be different for the two orthogonal orientations.\nFinally, there is another source of anisotropy: the field\nalong the z-axis can show a renormalization of the coupling to the system that is different from that along the\nx-axis.\nIn order to elucidate this last point, we have included\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\nt (ps)\n\nFIG. 6: Comparison between amplitudes for excitations with\nfields along z and x axis as function of time at T=60 K. In\nthe inset the ratio of these amplitudes as function of the temperature for times just after the pulse.\n\nin our model the anisotropy induced by the dysprosium\nions. As a result, a modification of the coupling of the\nmagnetic field to the iron ions takes place. According\nto a simple scheme proposed long ago by Zvezdin and\nMatveev,29 the coupling to the field along the z-direction\nis reduced by the factor 1 + \u03b7z \u2243 0.74 (see in Fig.2(b) the\neffect of this reduction). Instead, the reduction 1 + \u03b7x\nof the coupling along the x-axis is temperature dependent and can be extracted by the measurements of magnetic properties.29 With temperature decreasing toward\n50 K, these coupling factors can become a non-negligible\nsource of anisotropy. As shown in Fig. 6, the difference\nin the amplitudes for the response along the z- and x-axis\ncan become relevant at those temperatures. However, as\nshown in the inset of Fig. 6, the ratio between the amplitudes along x and z axis increases with temperature\nup to an inversion point. Therefore the source of the\nanisotropy associated only to dysprosium ions seems not\nto be effective for the interpretation of the experimental\ndata.\n\nC.\n\nStable phase at low temperatures\n\nIn this last subsection we focus on the \u03931 phase that\nis stable at low temperatures.\nThe measurements reported in Ref.12 show the maximum value of the amplitude of the magnetization between 20 and 50 K. Moreover, the frequency of the photoinduced magnetization is constant in this temperature\n\n\f9\nrange at the value close to 50 K that is characteristic of\nthe \u03934 phase. Therefore, the laser pulse is inducing excitation modes of the phase that should be unstable at\nlow temperatures.\nIn order to stabilize the \u03931 phase, the free energy (1)\nhas to be supplemented with a quartic term,29 for instance, a term that decreases the energy when the moments are antiferromagnetically aligned along the y axis\n(2)\n(see Fig.1). We assume V \u2192 V \u2032 = V \u2212 Ayy (Y1 \u2212 Y2 )4 in\norder to describe the system in simple terms. Upon linearization around the equilibrium configuration Y1eq = 1\nand Y2eq = \u22121, the two modes characteristic of this phase\ncan be derived. The first one, with frequency\n\u03c9z2\n2\n= 2E(32A(2)\nyy \u2212 2Axx ) \u2212 D ,\n\u03b32\n\n(34)\n\ncorresponds to a dynamic with \u2206X1 = \u2212\u2206X2 and\n\u2206Z1 = \u2206Z2 , while the second mode, with frequency\n\u03c9x2\n2\n= 2E(2Azz \u2212 32A(2)\nyy ) \u2212 D ,\n\u03b32\n\n(35)\n\nis characterized by \u2206X1 = \u2206X2 and \u2206Z1 = \u2212\u2206Z2 .\nWe follow the procedure of Sec. II: the anisotropy constants are derived by Eqs.(34,35) and the experimental\n(2)\nRaman spectra17 by imposing Ayy = 0. At T=50 we find\nAxx (\u03931 ) = \u22121040 Oe that is close to Axx (\u03934 ) = \u2212640 Oe\nobtained if the \u03934 phase is stable at that temperature.\n(2)\nThe values of Ayy required to stabilize the \u03931 phase are\nsmall. The free energy corresponding to the equilibrium\n(2)\nposition of the \u03931 phase is V1 = \u2212E \u2212 16Ayy , while that\nof the \u03934 phase is at first order in the canting angle \u03b20\nV4 = \u2212E \u2212 D(2\u03b20 ) \u2212 2Axx = \u2212E \u2212\n\nD2\n\u2212 2Axx . (36)\nE\n\nThe condition V1 < V4 implies that\nD2\nAxx\n+\n.\n(37)\n16E\n8\nTaking into account the values of the exchange fields\ngiven in the previous section and the anisotropy constant\n(2)\nAxx (\u03931 ), we derive Ayy > 60 Oe. Therefore the value of\n(2)\nthe constant Ayy is consistent with the expansion of the\nfree energy being only a fraction of the anisotropy energies Axx and Azz .\n(2)\nIf the parameter Ayy is of the order of hundreds of\nOersted, the phases \u03934 and \u03931 are close in energy. Due\nto a small light absorption, the laser pulse could affect the stability of the system by favoring the \u03934 phase\non a short time scale. Therefore the femtosecond pulse\ncould induce a reorientational phase transition from \u03931\nto \u03934 state in analogy with the antiferromagnetic-toferromagnetic phase transition induced by heating with a\nlaser in FeRh films.30 Finally, we point out that a static\nmagnetic field gives rise to a spin reorentational transition in orthoferrites.29 Hence the role of the magnetic\nfield pulse induced via the inverse Faraday effect could be\ninvestigated in relation to the perturbation of the phase\nstability. This is left for future investigations.\nA(2)\nyy >\n\nIV.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nStimulated by recent experimental results showing ultrafast non-thermal control of magnetization by instantaneous photomagnetic pulses in dysprosium orthoferrites,\na theoretical study of magnetization dynamics has been\npresented in this paper. We have employed a general\nform of free energy suitable for dysprosium orthoferrites\nwhose parameters are derived from experimental measurements. We have solved coupled sublattice LandauLifshitz-Gilbert equations whose damping parameter is\ndetermined by considering the scattering rate due to\nmagnon-magnon interaction. Due to the inverse Faraday effect, the magnetic fields perturbing the equilibrium configuration can be modeled as Gaussian pulses\nwith amplitude proportional to the intensity of the light\npulse and time width of the order of hundred femtoseconds. The non-linear dynamical equations have been integrated through an optimized Runge-Kutta algorithm\nand an analytical solution of the linearized system has\nbeen discussed in the case when the magnetic field pulse\nis assumed to have the shape of a delta function. This\nsolution provides the right orders of magnitude allowing\nto interpret the experimental results in simple terms.\nWe have found that the quasi-antiferro mode is excited\nby the pulse along the z-axis and the oscillations of the\nmagnetization have amplitudes compatible with experiment. Magnetic fields in opposite directions give rise to\nout-of-phase oscillations showing a behavior in agreement\nwith experimental results for times longer than the initial\ntransient. We have stressed that the magnetization dynamics is not only strongly influenced by the amplitude\nof the magnetic field pulse, but also by the parameters\ndetermining the free energy, in particular the ratio between the antisymmetric and symmetric exchange energies. The temperature dependence of the magnetization\ndynamics has been discussed showing that the proposed\ndamping mechanism based on magnon-magnon scattering can be effective on the picosecond scale. When the\nfield pulse is along the x-axis, the quasi-ferro mode is excited, but there are some discrepancies in the comparison\nbetween theory and data. We point out that the response\nalong the x-axis can be strongly influenced in orthoferrites by several effects such as the optical birefringence\nand the anisotropy of the magneto-optical susceptibility.\nFinally, the behavior of the magnetization has been analyzed in the low-temperature range where, due to an\nunavoidable heating effect, the laser pulse could perturb\nthe stability between \u03931 and \u03934 state.\nWe notice that the model proposed in this work has neglected dipolar contributions because they are orders of\nmagnitude smaller than exchange and anisotropy terms.\nMoreover, due to the fact that the effective magnetic field\nobtained through the inverse Faraday effect shows spatial\nvariations negligible on the microscopic scale, only the\nspin-wave modes at zero wave-vector are excited. Since\nthe static magnetization changes slowly in the investigated temperature range, the presence of spin-waves with\n\n\f10\nwave-vectors different from zero should not provide sizable contributions to the dynamic behavior. Therefore,\nthe macrospin approximation employed in this paper can\nbe considered reliable.\nFinally, we point out that the approach employed for\ndysprosium orthoferrites can be also generalized to describe the magnetization dynamics of other rare-earth\northoferrites, at least in the \u03934 phase. The anisotropy\nconstants are the only quantities strongly dependent on\nthe rare-earth ion, but these do not play a major role in\naffecting statics and dynamics. On the other hand, the\nmost important values of the exchange fields are of the\nsame order in several rare-earth orthoferrites.17 Clearly\nthe approach proposed in this paper is suitable for magnetic dielectrics and not for metallic itinerant magnets.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\nE.
