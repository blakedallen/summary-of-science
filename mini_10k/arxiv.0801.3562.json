The presence of spiral shocks in grand design galaxies explains the predominance of young stars in spiral arms\n(Roberts 1969; Woodward 1976; Cepa & Beckman 1990;\nKnapen et al. 1992, 1996), and can also account for the observed velocity dispersions in molecular clouds (Zhang et al.\n2001; Bonnell et al. 2006; Kim, Kim & Ostriker 2006). Otherwise, star formation is thought to occur through triggering by supernovae (Mueller & Arnett 1976; Gerola & Seiden\n1978), spontaneously through gravitational, thermal or magnetic instabilities, or by turbulent compression (as reviewed\nin Elmegreen 1996).\nFrom optical images, spiral galaxies can be classified as\ni) grand design, usually consisting of 2 symmetrical spiral\narms, ii) multi-armed, with several asymmetric spiral arms\nor iii) flocculent, with multiple shorter arms. Using the classification scheme of Elmegreen & Elmegreen (1987), grand\n\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail: dobbs@astro.ex.ac.uk\n\nc 0000 RAS\n\ndesign galaxies are inclusive of multi-armed spiral galaxies, but we retain this terminology to distinguish between\nthe two types. Classical grand design structure is thought\nto originate from perturbations due to bars or companion\ngalaxies which induce a density wave in the underlying stellar disk. Flocculent (and multi-armed) structure develops\nfrom local gravitational instabilities, which are sheared into\nshort, transient spiral arms. Most flocculent galaxies are\nalso found to have a weak density wave in the older stellar population visible in the K band (Thornley & Mundy\n1997; Grosb\u00f8l & Patsis 1998).\nSeveral hydrodynamical simulations\nhave investigated the response of the ISM to spiral density waves in grand design galaxies, by assuming\na rigidly rotating spiral potential, usually with an\nisothermal medium (Patsis, Grosbol & Hiotelis 1997;\nChakrabarti, Laughlin & Shu 2003; Kim & Ostriker 2002;\nDobbs & Bonnell 2006). The spiral pattern in these simulations is assumed to be long-lasting, of at least several\nrotation periods. The formation of dense structures along\nthe spiral arms are associated with molecular clouds\n(Kim, Ostriker & Stone 2003; Dobbs, Bonnell & Pringle\n\n\f2\n\nC. L. Dobbs, I. A. Bonnell\n\n2006; Dobbs & Bonnell 2007b) and the shearing of\nthese features produces spurs perpendicular to the\narms (Kim & Ostriker 2002; Dobbs & Bonnell 2006;\nShetty & Ostriker 2006). For the purely hydrodynamic\nsimulations (Wada & Koda 2004; Dobbs et al. 2006), the\ndevelopment of molecular clouds and spurs is controlled\nby the dynamics of the shock. Similar features are formed\nthrough gravitational instabilities (Kim & Ostriker 2002;\nShetty & Ostriker 2006).\nThe generation of turbulence has also been examined in\nsimulations of galactic disks. Wada et al. (2002) show that\ngravitational instabilities combined with galactic rotation\ncan drive turbulence, producing flocculent spiral structure.\nSupernovae are expected to be a major progenitor of turbulence (de Avillez & Breitschwerdt 2005; Joung & Mac Low\n2006) in the ISM, whilst Piontek & Ostriker (2005) suggest that MRI driven turbulence may be important in\nthe outer parts of discs where supernovae are less frequent. An alternative possibility which has emerged recently\nis that spiral shocks may induce turbulence (Zhang et al.\n2001; Bonnell et al. 2006; Kim et al. 2006; Dobbs & Bonnell\n2007b). In particular, Bonnell et al. (2006) show the passage\nof gas through a spiral arm and the formation of molecular\nclouds which exhibit a \u03c3 \u221d r 0.5 velocity dispersion law.\nRealistic galactic potentials are not rigid, but time dependent. Even in grand design galaxies, the spiral pattern\nand pitch angle of the spiral arms may change within a\nfew rotation periods (Merrifield, Rand & Meidt 2006). For\ngalaxies where the spiral structure arises through more localised gravitational instabilities, the number and shape of\nspiral arms are expected to be continually evolving. Numerous N-body simulations have investigated the spiral structure arising from such instabilities in a stellar disc. If the\nmass of the halo is sufficient, the bar instability is prevented and the resulting structure then depends on the\nToomre Q parameter. Generally gravitational instabilities\nproduce flocculent and multi-armed spirals (Bottema 2003;\nLi, Mac Low & Klessen 2005), unless an increase of Q in\nthe centre of the disk is induced to suppress m > 2 modes\n(Thomasson, Elmegreen, Donner & Sundelius 1990). With\nQ \u223c 1 \u2212 2, multi-armed spirals with modes up to m = 6 are\nformed (Sellwood & Carlberg 1984). Lowering the disk mass\nor raising the velocity dispersion increases Q and produces\na flocculent galaxy (Elmegreen & Thomasson 1993). In all\nthese cases, the gaseous component of the disc develops a\nmuch more pronounced spiral structure than present in the\nstellar component. Hydrodynamical simulations show that\nthe gas becomes dense enough for star formation to occur\nin the spiral arms, providing the Toomre criterion (Toomre\n1964) is satisfied (Q . 1 for gas (Tasker & Bryan 2006) or\ngas and stars (Li et al. 2005)).\nIn this paper, we describe hydrodynamical simulations\nof multi-armed spiral galaxies, which use an active galactic potential. This potential is taken from an N-body simulation described in Sellwood & Carlberg (1984). The potential has also recently been used for 2D gas simulations\n(Clarke & Gittins 2006) with the grid code CMHOG, which\nhighlight the dependence of the star formation rate on the\nchanging spiral structure. Whilst the gas dynamics in the\ngrand design simulations are driven by a density wave, the\npotential from the N-body simulation arises through transient gravitational instabilities in the disc stars. We describe\n\nthe galactic structure, gas dynamics and the properties of\nmolecular clouds which arise with the active potential, and\ncompare with previous simulations where a rigid potential\nwas adopted (Dobbs & Bonnell 2007b).\n\n2\n\nCALCULATIONS\n\nWe use the 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH)\ncode based on the version by Benz (Benz et al. 1990). The\nsmoothing length is allowed to vary with space and time,\nwith the constraint that the typical number of neighbours\nfor each particle is kept near Nneigh \u223c 50. Artificial viscosity\nis included with the standard parameters \u03b1 = 1 and \u03b2 = 2\n(Monaghan & Lattanzio 1985; Monaghan 1992).\nWe describe the galactic potential and initial conditions\nfor the simulations in Sections 2.1 and 2.2. The 3 simulations performed are also summarised in Table 1. In all the\nsimulations, self-gravity magnetic fields, heating, cooling or\nfeedback from star formation are not included. This paper\nfocuses on the differences in the gas dynamics and structure\nresulting from the active potential.\n\n2.1\n\nGalactic potential\n\nThe gravitational potential for these calculations is taken\nfrom a previous N-body simulation (Sellwood & Carlberg\n1984). The N-body calculation includes both a disk and a\nrigid halo, the latter suppressing the formation of a bar in\nthe disk. In the N-body simulation, the disk evolves to produce an asymmetric spiral pattern with several spiral arms.\nThe distribution of particles in the calculation are shown at\ndifferent times in Fig. 2 of Sellwood & Carlberg (1984). The\namplitude of the perturbation peaks after approximately 1\nrotation period, measured at the midpoint of the disk, after\nwhich the intensity of the spiral pattern quickly decays. The\nspiral perturbation to the potential decays in the N-body\nsimulation as the velocity dispersion increases, and the disc\nbecomes stable (i.e. Q>1) against gravitational instabilities.\nThe gravitational potential and accelerations were derived from the N-body simulation and used in previous results by Clarke & Gittins (2006). Both quantities were calculated over a 2D cylindrical polar grid consisting of 90 x\n128 points, after each time step in the N-body simulation\n(giving a total of 1500 grids). In this paper we just use the\naccelerations, which we interpolate both spatially and with\ntime. Thus at a given time in the SPH calculation, we use\nthe accelerations from the polar grids at the closest preceding and succeeding times.\nOur simulations are 3D, so we also apply accelerations\nacting solely in the z direction assuming an axisymmetric\nlogarithmic disk potential, i.e.:\nFz\n\n=\n\n\u03c8disk\n\n=\n\n\u2212d\u03c8disk\nwhere\ndz\n1 2\nv0 log(r 2 + Rc2 + (z/zq )2 )\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Rc = 1 kpc, v0 = 220 km s\u22121 and zq =0.7 is a measure\nof the disc scale height. The gravitational field is not fully\nconsistent, since the z component is not related to the spiral\npotential. Thus the generation of turbulence by 'flapping'\nmotions of the spiral shocks (Kim et al. 2006), is not able\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201312\n\n\fSimulations of galaxies with an active potential\nRun\n\nNo. of\nparticles\n\nMass of cold\n(100 K) gas (M\u2299 )\n\nMass of warm\n(104 K) gas (M\u2299 )\n\nTotal mass\n(M\u2299 )\n\nAverage \u03a3\n(M\u2299 pc\u22122 )\n\nMass of H2 after\n200 Myr (M\u2299 )\n\nA\nB\nC\n\n27 million\n27 million\n4 million\n\n9 \u00d7108\n6 \u00d7108\n0\n\n108\n6 \u00d7108\n1.2 \u00d7109\n\n109\n1.2 \u00d7109\n1.2 \u00d7109\n\n3.2\n3.9\n3.9\n\n1.5 \u00d7108\n3.9 \u00d7108\n-\n\n3\n\nTable 1.

We exclude particles from the inner 1 kpc radius of the disk, but as the simulation progresses, particles\nmay enter this region. The initial velocities of the particles assume the rotation curve given in Sellwood & Carlberg\n(1984) (Equation 2), with a maximum rotational velocity of\n220 km s\u22121 , and the particles are initially placed on circular orbits. We choose a length scale such that the maximum\nextent of the potential is 14 kpc (corresponding to r=7 in\nSellwood & Carlberg (1984)), although since the spiral perturbation does not extend to the whole of the disk in the\nN body simulation, we adopt a maximum radius of 10 kpc.\nWith this choice of length and velocity scales, the time for a\nsimulation to complete the equivalent of the 1500 timesteps\nof the N-body calculation is 430 Myr. This corresponds to\na time of t=4 on Fig. 2 of Sellwood & Carlberg (1984) (or\nequivalently 0.94 Gyr in Clarke & Gittins 2006).\nIn addition to the rotational velocities, we also imposed\na dispersion on the velocity distribution. The added dispersion is selected from a Gaussian distribution with a standard\ndeviation of 2.5% of the orbital speed. This was used for all\nthe x, y, and z velocities. The velocity dispersion in the z\ndirection maintains vertical equilibrium in the disk. Turbulence is not explicitly included in the initial conditions of\nour simulations. However, as mentioned in the introduction,\nprevious results have shown that spiral shocks induce a significant velocity dispersion in the gas. Thus the turbulence\nis generated self consistently in the simulation as gas is subject to spiral shocks, and the initial velocity dispersion is\nnot very significant to the outcome of our results.\nWe perform 2 high resolution simulations, with 27 million particles (Table 1), where the resolution is approximately 40 M\u2299 per particle. One calculation contains predominantly cold gas, with a much smaller fraction of warm\ngas, whilst the other uses equal phases of warm (104 K) and\ncold gas. The SPH particles are initially randomly assigned\nas warm or cold gas. We also perform a lower resolution calculation with just warm gas, and in all calculations the gas\nis isothermal.\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201312\n\n2.3\n\nTwo phase medium\n\nIn this present study, we neglect any heating or cooling between the 2 phases (so cold particles remain cold throughout the simulation). Although a full thermal treatment is\npreferable, a two phase medium is a first approximation\nto modeling cold and warm gas simultaneously, and allows a direct comparison with our previous calculations\n(Dobbs & Bonnell 2007b). Observations indicate both of\nthese components are present in the ISM (Heiles & Troland\n2003), and thus it is important to include them in spiral shocks. We assume that cold gas is pre-existing in the\nISM (rather than the outcome of cooling from the warmer\nphase), as suggested by Pringle, Allen & Lubow (2001). Although if the cooling timescale of warm gas in the ISM\nis very short (i.e. a few Myr, e.g. Audit & Hennebelle\n2005; Heitsch et al. 2006; V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni et al. 2007;\nGlover & Mac Low 2007) cold clumps would quickly develop\nas warm gas enters the spiral arms, producing conditions in\nthe spiral shock similar to these calculations.\nAlthough randomly positioned initially, the warm and\ncold phases become separated during the simulation. This\nseparation is expected when gas passes through a spiral\nshock. In previous simulations (Dobbs & Bonnell 2007b;\nDobbs 2008), cold gas is compressed into well resolved\nclumps of order 106 M\u2299 . However phase separation is also\napparent before the gas has time to pass through the shock.\nThis is particularly noticeable at large radii in the calculations presented here, where the dynamical time is greatest.\nThis is a numerical rather than physical artifact, and occurs due to a discontinuity in pressure between the warm\nand cold gas (Price 2007). The separation of cold gas into\nclumps is accentuated by the shear velocities of the gas.\nWhen cold particles are adjacent to each other, a pressure\nimbalance between the two phases causes the cold gas particles to move closer together rather than move freely past\neach other. This pressure imbalance effectively suppresses\nmixing between the two phases of gas.\nApart from in the inner regions of the disk, gas flowing\ninto the spiral arms is situated in cold clumps surrounded\nby a warm medium. This distribution is nevertheless much\nmore similar to the physical conditions in the ISM, where\nthe cold gas is situated within higher density clumps, rather\nthan randomly interspersed with the warm gas. However the\ndistribution and spacing between these clumps is dependent\non the resolution, with clumps typically containing 50-100\nparticles. Ideally we would wish to remove this numerical instability, ensuring clumps produced in the calculations are\nsolely related to the spiral shocks. This should be feasible\nfor future calculations, by way of an artificial thermal conductivity term (Price 2007), which smoothes the pressure\nbetween adjacent gas particles of different temperatures.\n\n\f4\n\nC. L. Dobbs, I. A. Bonnell\n\n2.4\n\nCalculation of molecular gas density and\ncooling of molecular gas\n\nWe estimate the fraction of molecular gas using the equation for the rate of change of H2 density from Bergin et al.\n(2004),\ndn(H2 )\n= Rgr (T )np n(H) \u2212 [\u03b6cr + \u03b6diss (N (H2 ), AV )]n(H2 ).\ndt\n(2)\nThe total number density is np , where np = n(H) + 2n(H2 ),\nN is the column density (of atomic or molecular hydrogen)\nand T the temperature. The photodissociation rate is\n\u03b6diss = \u03b6diss (0)f (N (H2 ), AV ),\n\n(3)\n\nfrom Draine & Bertoldi (1996). The constant \u03b6diss (0) =\n4.17 \u00d7 10\u221211 s\u22121 is the photodissociation rate for unshielded\nH2 . The H2 is assumed to be subject to a radiation field\nequivalent to the U.V. radiation emitted by B0 stars averaged over the plane of the Galactic disk. The function\nf (N (H2 ), AV ) takes into account self shielding of the H2 .\nThis function includes the dust extinction (AV ), and the\ncolumn density of the H2 , the latter calculated using the\nlocal density of H2 and the scale height of the disk. The\nsecond destructive term is the cosmic ray ionization rate,\n\u03b6cr = 6 \u00d7 10\u221218 s\u22121 . The rate of formation on grains is\nRgr , assuming an efficiency of S = 0.3. We do not explicitly change S for the warm gas in our calculations, but the\ndensity of the warm gas is too low to prevent immediate\nphotodissociation of any H2 formed (Dobbs et al. 2006).\nAlthough we do not include heating or cooling between\nthe 2 phases, we do allow cooling of the 100 K gas which\nbecomes molecular. We use a simple polytropic equation of\nstate P \u221d \u03c10.7 (Larson 2005) suggested for molecular clouds.\nWe take only the molecular gas density for this equation\nof state, setting a maximum temperature of 100 K for gas\nwhich is fully atomic and a minimum temperature of 30\nK for gas which is fully molecular. It is not thought that\nthe addition of molecular cooling has a significant effect on\nthese simulations, but may increase the density slightly in\nthe shocks and prolong the time gas remains molecular. As\nthe molecular gas dissociates, the gas heats back up (to a\nmaximum temperature of 100 K) using the same equation\nof state.\n\n3\n\nRESULTS\n\nThe primary driver for the evolution of the gas is the development of spiral arms in the N-body potential. The main\ndifference between the simulations presented here and those\nfor a grand design galaxy is that the potential changes on\ntimescales comparable to the gas crossing time of a spiral\narm. Rather than gas passing through a spiral shock, the\nevolution and structure of the gas is determined by local\nchanges in the potential minimum and collisions between\nspiral arms.\n3.1\n\nStructure of the disc\n\nThe development of the spiral structure with time for the 3\ndifferent calculations is shown in Fig. 1. The perturbation\nto the potential, and hence the extent of the spiral arms, is\n\nat first restricted to the inner disc. The spiral arms spread\nto larger radii as the magnitude and extent of the spiral\nperturbation to the potential increase. The number of spiral\narms is not constant and the dominant mode varies between\nm = 2 and m = 8 (Clarke & Gittins 2006). The structure\nalso changes as spiral arms collide with each other, giving\nthe appearance of bifurcations of the arms into different\nbranches. Enhanced star formation is predicted where high\ndensity regions develop as the arms collide (Clarke & Gittins\n2006). Approximately half way through the N-body simulation, the spiral perturbation in the disk begins to decrease.\nConsequently the spiral structure begins to wind up after\nabout 200 Myr in our simulations.\nThe large scale structure and spiral features (Fig. 1)\nare similar for the different thermal distributions. With cold\ngas present there are dense clumps in the shocks and higher\ndensity regions, whereas when there is only warm gas (lower\npanels), the spiral arms are smooth. In some regions, the\ngas appears to form 'double shocks', much more noticeable\nfor the cold gas, although still apparent for the simulation\nwith warm gas and in Clarke & Gittins (2006). These are\ndue to new spiral arms forming, which attain similar rotational velocities to older spiral arms. The structure towards\nthe centre of the predominantly cold simulation becomes\nchaotic, due to repeated collisions of stronger shocks in this\nregion.\nA detailed section of the simulation with 50% warm gas\n(Run B) is shown in Fig. 2. There is considerable structure\nin the cold gas in both the spiral arms and inter-arm regions. However, the agglomeration of gas into larger clumps\nin the shock is not as apparent as when there is a standing\ndensity wave from a grand design potential (Dobbs 2008).\nInstead, collisions between spiral arms are more important\n(e.g. Fig 2), and this is where the largest structures form in\nthe gas (and thus where agglomeration of clumps is occurring).\n3.2\n\nGas dynamics of dynamically evolving galaxy\n\nThe response of the gas to the active potential appears to\nbe quite different to the behaviour of gas subject to a grand\ndesign potential. We describe here the main differences between the two cases.\nFor the active potential considered here, the gas essentially traces the potential minimum. This is in contrast to\ngrand design galaxies, where the gas shocks as it passes the\nminimum but then leaves the spiral shock to continue to the\nnext spiral arm. Here gas enters the minima of the potential\nas they form, unlike the grand design case where the minima already exist. The gas then tends to accumulate in the\npotential minima rather than climbing out of the potential,\nretaining spiral structure even as the potential minimum\ndissolves.\nIn Fig. 3, we show the typical evolution of gas as it\nenters a potential minimum. The figure highlights a selection\nof particles at 4 different time frames from the simulation\nwith warm gas. The particles were selected as those in the\nsection of spiral arm shown in the third frame, with their\nlocations at earlier times shown in the top two panels. As\na minimum develops in the underlying potential, a shock\noccurs as gas falls into the minimum and produces a spiral\narm. The top two panels of Fig. 3 indicate that particles\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201312\n\n\fSimulations of galaxies with an active potential\n\n5\n\nFigure 1. The time evolution of the spiral pattern is shown in these column density plots, which are inclusive of both cold and warm\nphases of gas. The top row shows Run A with predominantly cold gas, the middle with equal proportions of cold and warm gas (Run B)\nand for the bottom row, all the gas is 104 K (Run C). Each plot shows a region of -11 kpc< x <11kpc and -11 kpc< y <11kpc, assuming\na Cartesian axis centred at the origin, and gas is flowing anticlockwise round the disk. The main spiral arm features are analogous for\nthe different thermal distributions, although there is much more structure on smaller scales when there is cold gas.\n\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201312\n\n\f6\n\nC. L. Dobbs, I. A. Bonnell\n\nFigure 2. These images zoom in on a small region from the simulation with 50% cold gas, Run B. The plots correspond to a time of 200\nMyr, and show areas of size i) 22 kpc x 22 kpc, ii) 8 kpc x 8 kpc, iii) 4 kpc x 4 kpc and iv) 1.5 kpc x 1.5 kpc. The gas appears increasingly\nstructured at smaller scales, becoming sheared into filamentary structures in the inner regions. The figure focuses on a bridge of gas\nbetween two spiral arms which corresponds with the remnants of a previous arm. Dense material has agglomerated either side of this\nbridge, where spiral arms have collided. The same scale is used as shown in Fig. 1.\n\nenter the minimum from both sides of the developing spiral\narm. The spiral arm in the bottom left panel is much sharper\non the upstream side where the gas generally flows into the\nspiral arm (Bonnell et al. 2006). The fourth panel in Fig. 3\n(bottom right) shows the particles at a much later time, by\nwhich time they have formed a completely different spiral\narm.\nFig. 4 shows the densest gas from 2 of the simulations\noverplotted on the underlying potential. In the top panel,\nthe gas is taken from the simulation with predominantly\ncold gas (Run A) and for the other, the gas is warm (Run\nC). Only the non-axisymmetric component of the potential is shown, calculated at each point by subtracting the\nmean value of the potential over the corresponding cylindrical radius. In both cases the high density gas strongly\ncoincides with the potential minimum. Since gas effectively\n\nfalls into the spiral potential, this is not surprising. The coincidence between the spiral arms and the potential minima is in contrast with grand design models where the spiral shocks tend to be offset from the potential minimum.\nRoberts (1969) found that spiral shocks occur on the leading side of the potential minimum inside co-rotation for\nquasi-stationary solutions with m = 2. However the location\nvaries depending on sound speed, pattern speed, number\nof spiral arms and magnetic field strength, as shown in recent simulations (Slyz, Kranz & Rix 2003; Gittins & Clarke\n2004; Dobbs & Price 2008; Wada 2007). For the active potential applied here, a quasi-stationary state of course does\nnot evolve, since the spiral potential changes with time, and\nwe would not expect an offset between the spiral shock and\nstar formation.\nThere are nevertheless some sections of spiral arms that\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201312\n\n\fSimulations of galaxies with an active potential\n\n7\n\nFigure 3. The particles are shown for a subsection of the disc at times of 70 (top left), 76 (top right), 82 (bottom left) and 195 (bottom\nright) Myr for the simulation with warm gas (Run C). Particles indicated in black were selected from the spiral arm displayed in the\nbottom left panel, and are shown at earlier and later times in the other panels. The first three panels show the accumulation of gas into\na spiral arm. The spiral arm structure of the gas persists as the gas encounters multiple spiral arm passages, as indicated by the fourth\npanel. At the latest time, only 1 in 10 of the total number of particles are plotted.\n\nappear to cross between two minima.The stellar spiral arms\nassociated with the N-body simulation are transient, so the\nminimum will eventually disappear. However the gaseous\nspiral arms still retain their spiral structure, even though\nthe minimum dissolves. Eventually the gas reaches another\nminimum and joins a new spiral arm. The final panel in\nFig. 3 shows a different section of spiral arm at a much\nlater time frame. The selected particles have already passed\n3 spiral arms at this point. Gas particles highlighted with\ny > \u22122 kpc are largely coincident with a potential minimum, and also corresponds to one of the dense arms of gas\nin Fig. 4. On the other hand, gas particles with x > \u22122 kpc\nlie between two minima or are forming the new spiral arm\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201312\n\nseen in the lower part of the figure. In Fig. 4, spiral arms\nlying between the potential minima are most evident when\ncold gas is present and the densities of the gas are higher.\nA further consequence of gas retaining the spiral structure\nimposed by the potential is that at later times in the simulations (e.g. 3rd time frame, Fig. 1), most of the gas is in the\nspiral arms. Regions between the arms are relatively empty,\nand since little gas is entering the potential, the spiral arms\ncorrespond merely to dense regions of gas rather than actual\nspiral shocks.\nIn addition to the density, the velocity of the gas which\nis in the spiral arms largely follows that of the stellar component of the disc, with different pattern speeds emerging\n\n\f8\n\nC. L. Dobbs, I. A. Bonnell\n\nFigure 5. The velocity dispersion is shown against azimuth after\n200 Myr for Run B (50% cold gas). The angle \u03b8 is measured\nanticlockwise, in the direction of the flow, at radii of 4 and 8 kpc.\n\nFigure 4. The most dense gas from simulations with predominantly cold (Run A, top) and warm (Run C, lower) is overplotted\non the potential from the N-body simulation. Only the spiral\ncomponent of the potential is indicated, and black/dark red indicate regions where the potential is lowest, yellow/white indicates\nthe potential is highest. The gas is shown in blue. Generally the\ndensest gas corresponds with the minima of the potential. The\nregions shown are 20 kpc x 20 kpc and the potential rotates in\nthe anti-clockwise direction. The corresponding time is 200 Myr.\n\nfor different sections of spiral arm. The rotational velocities\nof the gas thus indicate that there is no fixed pattern speed\nor co-rotation radius for the spiral perturbation.\n\n3.3\n\nVelocity dispersion\n\nFig. 5 shows the velocity dispersion for the 2 phase simulation with equal components of warm and cold gas (Run\nB) as a function of azimuth. The average velocity dispersion\nis calculated over a ring of width 200 pc and azimuthally\ndivided into 100 segments. The ring is centred at 2 different\nradii, 4 kpc and 8 kpc. Both show peaks where the gas passes\nthrough spiral shocks, but whereas at radii of 4 kpc, the velocity dispersion reaches > 10 km s\u22121 , at 8 kpc the velocity\ndispersion barely exceeds 3 km s\u22121 . All the gas (warm and\ncold) is used to determine the velocity dispersion in Fig. 5.\n\nThe variation in the velocity dispersion is dominated by the\ncold gas.\nThe increase in the velocity dispersion occurs as clumpy\ngas passes through a spiral shock (Dobbs & Bonnell 2007a)\nand the magnitude of the increase is dependent on the Mach\nnumber of the shock. At smaller radii, the potential is much\nstronger, so the Mach number and therefore velocity dispersion are higher. Likewise, for a given radius, the velocity\ndispersion in the spiral arms increases with time whilst the\nstrength of the perturbation to the potential increases. However the velocity dispersion starts decreasing by 250 Myr,\nsince little gas is entering the spiral arms and shocks are no\nlonger occurring.\n\n3.4\n\nSpurs and branches\n\nIn simulations of grand design galaxies, regular spurs are\nfound to extend from the arms into the inter-arm regions.\nThese spurs are due to the shearing of clumps of gas leaving\nthe spiral arms. They can occur if there is cold gas (< 1000\nK) without self gravity (Dobbs & Bonnell 2006), or evolve\nfrom gravitational instabilities in warm gas (Kim & Ostriker\n2006). These features are not apparent in the simulations\nwith the active potential. As mentioned in Section 3.2, gas\ntends to stay in the spiral arms and retain spiral structure,\neven as the minimum dissolves. Thus without gas leaving the\nspiral arms, gas cannot form spurs. From a survey of feathering in spiral galaxies (La Vigne et al. 2006), 20% of galaxies\nare found to have periodic feathers. Generally galaxies with\ncomplex or flocculent structures are less likely to contain\nclearly defined feathers, although those with clearly defined\ndust lanes are more likely to contain such features.\nInstead, when a minimum in the potential disappears,\nthe gas retains the shape of the whole arm. Thus much larger\nbranches occur in these simulations, located between the\nmain spiral arms. A clear example is shown in Fig. 2b. These\nfeatures are not present in simulations with time independent potentials, except where resonances occur (Patsis et al.\n1997; Chakrabarti et al. 2003). As the potential minimum\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201312\n\n\fSimulations of galaxies with an active potential\n\n9\n\nFigure 6. These images display the column density of molecular hydrogen (red) overplotted on the total column density of HI, from\nRuns A and B. The left panels show Run A, with 90% cold gas, and the right Run B, with 50% cold gas. The top panels show regions\nof 16 kpc x 16 kpc, and the bottom panels show an area of 4 kpc x 4 kpc (where -3 kpc< x <1 kpc and 2 kpc < y <6 kpc assuming a\nCartesian grid) the same as in Fig. 2. All the panels correspond to a time of 200 Myr. In both simulations the molecular gas is situated in\nhighly structured clumps. With a larger component of warm gas, there is more inter-arm molecular gas, which is sheared into filamentary\nclumps.\n\ndecays, the velocity of the spiral arm adjusts to that of circular velocities, and the shape of the spiral arm changes by\ndifferential rotation. Large branches can be seen extending\nfrom the main spiral arms in many galaxies such as M101,\nM74 and M33. The pitch angle and length of these features\ntend to vary much more than would be expected from spurs\nwhich originate from instabilities in the spiral arms.\n\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201312\n\n3.5\n\nMolecular gas in the disk\n\nWe show the distribution of molecular gas, overplotted\non the total gas density in Fig. 6, for Runs A and B.\nSimilar to previous results with a grand design potential\n(Dobbs & Bonnell 2007b), there is much more molecular gas\nwhen there are equal amounts of cold and warm gas, compared to when the gas is nearly all cold. This is because,\nas mentioned in the previous paper, more of the inter-arm\ngas is molecular, when it is confined to higher densities by\n\n\f10\n\nC. L. Dobbs, I. A. Bonnell\n\nthe warm gas. There is also more molecular gas in these\nsimulations compared to the grand design case. This is due\nto a combination of factors: a stronger potential, the fact\nthat gas tends to remain in the spiral arms and collisions\nbetween spiral arms leading to more gas at higher densities.\nAfter 200 Myr (Table 1), 40% and 23% of the total disk mass\nis molecular for Runs A and B. However the system is not\nyet in equlibrium, and both fractions are still increasing.\n3.6\n\nMolecular clouds\n\nWe also applied a clump-finding algorithm to the distribution of molecular gas in Runs A and B, predominantly to\ncalculate the mass spectrum for comparison with previous\nresults for grand design galaxies (Dobbs & Bonnell 2007b).\nFor Run B, from Fig. 6, it is apparent that clumps in the\nouter part of the disk, where there is no spiral perturbation,\nhave formed which are numerical in origin. At later times\nin the simulations, these clumps have retained high densities for a sufficient time that they contain molecular gas. We\ntherefore only consider a region of 10 kpc by 10 kpc centred\nat the midpoint of the disk, which does not include these\nclumps.\nAs for Dobbs & Bonnell (2007b), we use a clumpfinding algorithm to identify molecular clouds. We take\nthe clump-finding method CF1 previously described in\nDobbs & Bonnell (2007b), which selects grid cells above a\ncertain column density and classes groups of adjacent cells\nas a single clump. We select cells which have a molecular\ngas surface density above 4 M\u2299 pc \u22122 , as used for our previous results (Dobbs & Bonnell 2007b), and only include\nclouds with > 30 particles. The resolution of the simulations shown here is over twice that of previous analysis\n(Dobbs & Bonnell 2007b) with the mass of each particle approximately 40 M\u2299 . The minimum total mass of a cloud is\nthen 103 M\u2299 , although the mass of molecular gas may be\nless.\nWe find that the most massive molecular clouds (>\n105 M\u2299 ) are located where spiral arms are colliding or\nmerging. This agrees with the previous predictions by\nClarke & Gittins (2006) that enhanced star formation would\noccur here. We also find that there are very few inter-arm\nclouds between 2 and 4 kpc where most of the gas is in the\nspiral arms, whereas at lower radii there are more interarm\nclouds as a result of multiple collisions between spiral arms.\nFig. 7 shows the mass spectra for Runs A and\nB. Assuming a mass spectrum of dN/dM = M \u2212\u03b1 ,\n\u03b1 = 1.75 \u00b1 0.12 for the simulation with predominantly cold\ngas, and \u03b1 = 2.05 \u00b1 0.1 with a larger (50%) component\nof hot gas. The mass distribution arises through cloud\ncoagulation (e.g. Field & Saslaw 1965; Taff & Savedoff\n1972; Handbury et al. 1977; Scoville & Hersh 1979;\nKwan & Valdes 1987; Das & Jog 1996; Clark & Bonnell\n2006; Harfst et al. 2006), a process enhanced by collisions\nbetween spiral arms. For previous simulations of grand\ndesign galaxies (Dobbs & Bonnell 2007b), we obtained\nsimilar values and also found that the mass spectrum for\nmolecular clouds was steeper with a larger component of\nwarm gas. This suggests that the nature of the ISM is more\nimportant in determining the mass spectrum than the nature of the potential, and how clump agglomeration occurs.\nPrevious observations of the Milky Way found \u03b1 = 1.5 \u2212 1.8\n\nFigure 7. The clump mass spectra are shown for Runs A and B.\nBoth are determined using the molecular mass of the clumps, after\n200 Myr. The slopes indicated correspond to \u03b1 = 1.75 (Run A)\nand \u03b1 = 2.05 (Run B) where \u03b1 is the index of the mass spectrum.\nThe mass spectrum is steeper when more warm gas is present.\n\n(Solomon et al. 1987), although some more recent surveys\nof external galaxies (Blitz et al. 2007; Lada et al. 2007)\nindicate that \u03b1 may be higher.\n\n4\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe have extended previous analysis of the structure and\ndynamics of the ISM in spiral galaxies by applying a timedependent spiral potential derived from an N-body calculation. The gas forms long spiral arms, exhibiting a multiarmed structure where the underlying stellar component is\ndetermined by gravitational instabilities rather than a spiral\ndensity wave. The main difference compared to the grand\ndesign case is that the development, collision and dissipation of spiral arms in the underlying potential is the main\ndriver for generating high density structure in the ISM. The\ntimescale for the evolution of structure is thus linked to the\nlifetime of the local minimum.\nGas accumulates in the potential minima as they develop, thus the densest gas is coincident with the stellar\nspiral arms. Consequently no offset would be expected between the dust lanes and star formation in such a galaxy.\nSpurs associated with the shearing of GMCs as they leave\nthe spiral arm, are largely absent with the active potential.\nThis is because gas only leaves the spiral arms once the potential minimum dissipates. The gas then retains the large\nscale spiral arm structure, becoming slowly wound up until\nit fully dissipates or encounters another spiral arm. Instead\nof spurs, much larger bridges, which are remnants of former\nspiral arms, extend between the main spiral arms.\nWe further identified molecular clouds from these simulations, finding that the largest GMCs occur where spiral\narms are colliding. We found the surprising result that the\nmass spectra are similar to previous results where the potential corresponded to a density wave. This suggests that\nthe external pressure applied to the cold gas determines the\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201312\n\n\fSimulations of galaxies with an active potential\nsizes and masses of the clouds, with a steeper index when\nthe cold clumps are pressure confined.\nA natural extension of this work would be to model both\nthe stellar and gaseous components of the disc, to include\nthe gravitational instabilities of the stars and the response\nof the gas simultaneously (Li et al. 2005). Furthermore incorporating stellar feedback is required to treat the stellar\nand gaseous components self consistently. We have also neglected heating and cooling, magnetic fields and self gravity,\nwhich we are in the process of analysing with respect to\ngrand design galaxies. We leave the consideration of these\nprocesses for more general stellar potentials to future work.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe are grateful to Jerry Sellwood and Dave Gittins for providing data from the N-body simulation described in Section 2.1.
