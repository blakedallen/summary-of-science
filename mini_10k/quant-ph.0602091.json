At T = 0, of course, phase transitions cannot be driven\nby thermal fluctuations. Nevertheless, they can be possible\nbecause of quantum fluctuations due to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. While classical phase transitions are marked\nby singularities in the free-energy density, points of quantum\nphase transitions are marked by points of non-analyticity in\nthe energy density of the ground state. First-order QPT are\ncharacterized by a discontinuity in the first derivative of the\nground state energy, while second-order QPT have discontinuities in the second derivative of the energy density. In these\npoints, the energy spectrum is gapless and some characteristic\nlength scale diverges, like the equal-time correlation functions\nin the ground state. Higher order quantum phase transitions\ncorrespond to discontinuities in the higher order derivatives\nof the energy but are of little physical interest. In general, any\ncontinuous QPT consists in the spectrum becoming gapless at\nthe critical point [1]. Another way to look at quantum phase\ntransitions is to look at the many-body ground state of the system. A quantum phase transitions results in a non analyticity\nof the many-body eigenstate. First order quantum phase transitions arise from a level crossing in the many-body ground\nstate, and can hence also happen in finite size systems [1], and\nin this case it is the many-body ground state to be discontinuous. On the other hand, second order (or continuous) quantum\nphase transitions come from a higher order singularity in the\nground state. In order to obtain an exact transition, it is necessary the thermodynamic limit. The system becomes gapless\nin the limit of the critical point, and excitations with arbitrary\nlow energy are possible. Recently, it has been showed that the\noverlap between two ground states for different parameters is\nsingular at the quantum critical point [2].\nQuantum phase transitions are a very rich field of physics\nthat has seen recently a great development from both the theoretical and experimental point of view in systems like highTc superconductors, quantum Hall systems, fractional quantum Hall liquids, quantum magnets and so on [1]. Moreover,\nquantum phase transitions can occur between phases that are\nnot characterized by any local order parameter or symmetry\nbreaking description, but that have different quantum order,\nwhich is one of the most exciting and novel streams of re-\n\nsearch in theoretical condensed matter [3]. Recently, quantum phase transitions have been studied in the context of the\ntheory of entanglement where points of quantum phase transitions are believed to be connected to points of extremality for\nthe entanglement or its derivatives [4].\nIn this paper, we study the connection between Berry\nphases and quantum phase transitions. Since the seminal paper of M. Berry [5] and the previous work by Stone [6] it\nwas clear that Berry phases have a particular behaviour near\npoints in which a state becomes degenerate with some other\nstate. For instance, consider the case of a quantum system\ndescribed by a family of two-level real Hamiltonians. The\nparameter space is 2-dimensional and points of degeneracy\nhave co-dimension two, that is they are isolated points. If an\neigenvector acquires the phase factor \u22121 when taken around\na circuit C, then the circuit C encloses one degeneracy, even\nfor arbitrarily small circuits. In many-body quantum systems\npoints of degeneracy of the Hamiltonians are quantum critical points of the first order which suggests the possibility that\nBerry phases have some non trivial behaviour near all quantum critical points. Of course, in general quantum critical\npoints are not isolated points and this adds some complication.\nThe main result of this paper is that if we find a sequence of\nloops in the parameter space converging to a point \u03bb0 and the\ncorresponding Berry phases taken by an eigenvector drawn\naround those loops do not converge to zero, then \u03bb0 is a quantum critical point of some order. We call such a sequence of\nBerry phases non-contractible. Carollo and Pachos [7], have\nfirst showed a connection between the difference of Berry\nphases between first excited and ground state, and criticalities in the XY spin chain. In this paper, we provide a general\ntheory of the connection between Berry phases and quantum\nphases transitions, and, in discussing the XY spin chain, we\ncompute the Berry phase of the ground state to prove that a\nnon contractible sequence of Berry phases does imply a quantum phase transition.\nTopological considerations to detect degeneracies.- Detecting degeneracies of a continuous Hamiltonian that depends on a set of external parameters has been a subject of\nstudy within a field of molecular physics for several decades\nnow. The first paper that addressed this problem goes back\nto year 1963 when Herzberg and Longuet-Higgins [8] discovered the sign reversal of a real electronic eigenfunctions when\n\n\f2\ncontinuously transported around a degeneracy. This property\nwas subsequently used by Longuet-Higgins [9] to state a topological criterion for detecting degeneracies of real Hamiltonians. As a generalization, Stone [6] presented a general criterion for a genuinely complex Hamiltonian (Hamiltonian that\ndoes not have time-reversal symmetry). A further generalization, formulated by Johansson and Sj\u00f6qvist [10] for the case\nof real Hamiltonians, was shown to be optimal.\nThe proof of Stone is very instructive: consider a family of\nHamiltonians parametrized by a manifold Q and a 3d volume\nV \u2208 Q bounded by a closed surface G. We assume G being\na surface on which no level-crossing occurs and the adiabatic\ntheorem can be safely applied. The points of degeneracy in\nQ have dimension q \u2212 3[11]. In the case of real Hamiltonians\npoints of degeneracy have instead dimension q \u2212 2 (see for example [12]). Consider now a set of loops {\u0393j }M\nj=1 on G that\nfor M \u2192 \u221e continuously span the surface G. Then, to each\nloop and each non-degenerate eigenvalue i, we can assign the\ncorresponding Berry phase \u03b3ji . We assume \u03931 and \u0393M are ini\nfinitely small, and therefore \u03b31i = 0 and \u03b3M\n= 2\u03c0li , li \u2208 Z.\nIf li = 0, we call the surface G the phase-preserving surface,\nfor the value i. Otherwise, G is phase-rotating. In a phase rotating surfaces the phase factors trace a circle in their Argand\nplane. Note here that being phase rotating or preserving is a\nproperty of the whole surface G (and the eigenvalue i), and not\nof a particular loop \u0393j . If we bisect the volume V , at least one\nof the two surfaces enclosing the two volumes must be phaserotating, and we can hence construct by successive bisection\na sequence of arbitrarily small phase rotating surfaces converging to a point \u03bb0 \u2208 Q. Being arbitrarily small and phase\nrotating this surface contains arbitrarily small loops whose associated phase factor are finite. Then the wave-function must\nbe discontinuous in \u03bb0 and therefore it is a point of degeneracy.\nCan we use the Stone's test to detect quantum critical\npoints? The answer is no for two reasons. The first one is that\nin general quantum critical points are not isolated and then we\nare not guaranteed we can construct a suitable surface G. The\nsecond reason is that only first-order quantum critical points\ncan be detected even when they are isolated. Nevertheless, if\nwe are able to find a sequence of loops converging to a point\nsuch that the geometric phase remains finite we could still argue that there is a level-crossing involved. Moreover, in the\nthermodynamical limit, we can demonstrate that is either a\nlevel crossing or an avoided level crossing, as we are going to\nshow in the next section.\nBerry phases and quantum phase transitions.- The basic\nidea of this paper is that if Berry phases do not go to zero\nas we shrink the loops around a point \u03bb0 in the parameter\nspace Q, then that is a quantum critical point. Consider a\nsimply connected k \u2212 dim manifold Q of physical parameters\n\u03bb \u2261 (\u03bb1 , .., \u03bbk ) \u2208 Q and let H(\u03bb) be a family of Hamiltonians on the Hilbert space H, with a \u03bb\u2212independent domain\nD, bounded from below, and the functions H(\u03bb) with values\nin the Banach space of linear operators L(D, H) are k times\ncontinuously differentiable. The Hilbert space is thought to\nbe with finite degrees of freedom. Moreover the spectra of\nthe Hamiltonians are discrete. We remind that two Hamiltoni-\n\nans H0 and H1 are adiabatically connectible if they belong to\nthe same connected component of iso-degenerate Hamiltonians [13]. This happens when the vectors of the degeneracies\nare the same. Writing the Hamiltonians in their spectral resPR i i\nolution, H\u03b1 =\ni=1 \u01eb\u03b1 \u03a0\u03b1 (\u03b1 = 0, 1) (R can be infinite),\nwe can define the degeneracies vector associated to H\u03b1 as\nD\u03b1 := (tr\u03a01\u03b1 , ..., tr\u03a0R\n\u03b1 ), ordering the components according\nto the crescent order of the corresponding eigenvalues. The\nfact that two Hamiltonians H0 and H1 are adiabatically connectible does not mean that we can adiabatically turn one into\nthe other just changing the parameters in Q. For this we need\nan adiabatic surface: a surface S in the parameters space Q\nis said adiabatic if i) D(\u03bb) is constant on S, and ii) The projectors \u03a0i (\u03bb) are of class C 3 . On an adiabatic surface, for\nevery curve there is a parametrization such that the adiabatic\ntheorem holds.\nWhen the adiabatic curvature diverges in a point, no adiabatic evolution is possible for some trajectories through that\npoint: let S \u2212 {\u03bb0 } be an adiabatic surface in Q. Conj\nsider the adiabatic curvature [5] defined by F j = F\u03bc\u03bd\nd\u03bc \u2227\n\u03bc\n\u03bd\n\u03bc\n\u03bd\nd\u03bd = \u2212Im(\u2202/\u2202\u03bb hj(\u03bb)|) * (\u2202/\u2202\u03bb |j(\u03bb)i)d\u03bb \u2227 d\u03bb . Where\n|j(\u03bb)i is the j\u2212th eigenvector of H(\u03bb). If the curvature\ndiverges in \u03bb0 , i.e., lim\u03bb\u2192\u03bb0 kF j k = +\u221e, then the surface is non adiabatic in \u03bb0 . Indeed, consider the projector\n\u03a0j (\u03bb) = |j(\u03bb)ihj(\u03bb)| and its derivatives d/d\u03bb\u03bc \u03a0j (\u03bb) =\nd/d\u03bb\u03bc (|j(\u03bb)ihj(\u03bb)|). The divergence of F implies that for\nsome \u03bc,\nlim k\n\n\u03bb\u2192\u03bb0\n\nd j\n\u03a0 (\u03bb)k = +\u221e\nd\u03bb\u03bc\n\n(1)\n\nNow consider a regular curve \u03bbs : s \u2208 [0, 1] \u2192 \u03bb(s) \u2208\nQ such that \u03bb(s0 ) = \u03bb0 with s0 \u2208 [0, 1]. For every\nn\nparametrization of this curve, we obtain lims\u2192s0 k d\u03a0ds(s) k =\nn\n\u03bc\nlims\u2192s0 k d\u03a0d\u03bb(\u03bb)\nk | d\u03bbds(s) | = +\u221e, which means that\n\u03bc\nkd\u03a0n /dsk diverges along every regular curve in the limit\ns \u2192 s0 and hence the Hamiltonians on the curve \u03bbs are not\nadiabatically connectible in \u03bb0 .\nProposition 1.- Consider a k\u2212differentiable family of\nHamiltornians H(\u03bb) such that S \u2282 Q is an adiabatic surface everywhere but in the point \u03bb0 . We also assume that,\nfor the ground state |ji, k\u2202\u03bc H|jik is finite for every \u03bc. Let\nus consider a sequence of loops \u0393r converging to some point\n\u03bb0 \u2208 Q, that is, limr\u2192\u221e \u0393r = \u03bb0 and such that along every \u0393r we can apply the adiabatic theorem. Let us compute,\nfor the ground state |ji, the corresponding Berry phases \u03b3rj\nand let the associated sequence of Berry phases {\u03b3rj } be noncontractible, i.e., limr\u2192\u221e \u03b3rj 6= 0. Then S is not adiabatic in\n\u03bb0 and \u03bb0 is a quantum critical point. Notice that we do not\nneed to be able to apply the adiabatic theorem in \u03bb0 , which is\nthe candidate critical point.\nProof.- Consider the curvature associated to the Berry conj\nnection F j = dAj = F\u03bc\u03bd\nd\u03bc\u2227d\u03bd. The Berry phase associated\nto the loop \u0393 for the ground state |j(\u03bb)i is given byR the flux\nof F through the surface S bounded by \u0393: \u03b3 = \u2212 S F j . If\nwe shrink S to the point \u03bb0 , the flux goes to zero unless F j\ndiverges in norm in \u03bb0 . Therefore S is not adiabatic in \u03bb0 .\n\n\f3\nj\nUsing the resolution of the identity, we can write F\u03bc\u03bd\nas\nj\nF\u03bc\u03bd\n=\n\nX hj|\u2202\u03bc H|mihm|\u2202\u03bd H|ji\n(Em \u2212 Ej )2\n\n(2)\n\nm6=j\n\nNow let \u2206E = inf m |Ej \u2212 Em | and A\u03bcjm = hj|\u2202\u03bc H|mi.

The numerator of the above expression is finite\nj\nand thus if F\u03bc\u03bd\ndiverges in norm in \u03bb0 then \u2206E must go to\nzero in the same point. Since |ji is the ground state, then \u03bb0 is\na quantum critical point because we have a level crossing and\nthus a first order QPT. This proposition is easily generalizable\nto Hamiltonians that have a continuous spectrum, as long as\nthe low energy sector is discrete. We do not need to have\ninfinite degrees of freedom for a first order QPT.\nNevertheless, continuous phase transitions are possible in\nthe thermodynamic limit. We want to show that the divergence of the curvature still implies gaplessness for a system\nin the thermodynamic limit. Consider a sequence of families\nof Hamiltonians {Hn (\u03bb)}n\u2208N . Here n means the number of\ndegrees of freedom, so the thermodynamic limit is the system\ndescribed by n\u2192\u221e. Let us assume that for every finite n, the\nsurface S is adiabatic. Then no first order QPT is possible and\nfor every finite n, limr\u2192\u221e \u03b3rj (n) = 0. But it could happen\nthat for n\u2192 + \u221e some gap with the ground state closes, thus\nleading to a continuous QPT. To perform the thermodynamic\nlimit, we need intensive quantities. So if the normalization of\nthe ground state scales like N (n), then we need to use the intensive cuvature F\u0303 j = F j /N (n)2 . Now let the sequence be\nnon-contractible only in the thermodynamic limit\nlim lim N (n)\u22122 \u03b3rj (n) 6= 0\n\nr\u2192\u221e n\u2192\u221e\n\nthe usual Pauli operators. We will consider the more general Hamiltonian H(\u03bb, \u03b3, \u03c6) = \u011d(\u03c6)H(\u03bb, \u03b3)\u011d \u2020 (\u03c6), where\nQM\nz\n\u011d(\u03c6) = i=\u2212M ei\u03c3\u0302i \u03c6/2 , with \u03c6 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0). This way, the\nparameter space is the simply connected three dimensional\nEuclidean space Q \u2261 R3 . This Hamiltonian can be diagonalized by successively applying Jordan-Wigner, Fourier\nand Bogoliubov transformation (for details, see [1]), after\nwhich we obtain the free fermion Hamiltonian H(\u03bb, \u03b3, \u03c6) =\nPM\n\u2020\nexcitations,\nk=\u2212M \u039bk b\u0302k b\u0302k . The energies \u039bk of one-particle\nq\n2\ndefined by the operators b\u0302k , are \u039bk =\n\u03b5k + \u03b3 2 sin2 2\u03c0k\nN ,\nwith \u03b5k = cos 2\u03c0k\nN \u2212 \u03bb. The ground state of this Hamiltonian\nis given as a product of qubits in the following way:\n|gi =\n\nM \u0012\nO\n\ncos\n\nk=1\n\n\u03b8k\n\u03b8k\n|0ik |0i\u2212k + ie2i\u03c6 sin |1ik |1i\u2212k\n2\n2\n\n\u0013\nM \u0012\nX\n1+\u03b3 x x\n1\u2212\u03b3 y y\nz\nH(\u03bb, \u03b3) = \u2212\n\u03c3\u0302i \u03c3\u0302i+1 +\n\u03c3\u0302i \u03c3\u0302i+1 + \u03bb\u03c3\u0302i\n2\n2\ni=\u2212M\n(5)\nHere, the parameter \u03b3 \u2208 [0, +\u221e[ represents an anisotropy\nin the next-neighbor spin-spin interaction, while \u03bb \u2208 R\nis an external field. The operators \u03c3\u0302i\u03b1 , \u03b1 \u2208 {x, y, z} are\n\n(6)\n\nwhere |0ik and |1ik are the vacuum and first excited states of\nthe mode d\u02c6k introduced by the Fourier transformation, while\nb\u0302k = cos \u03b82k d\u02c6k \u2212 ie2i\u03c6 sin \u03b82k d\u02c6\u2020\u2212k and cos \u03b8k = \u03b5k /\u039bk =\n\u0001\n2 2\u03c0k \u22121/2\n2\u03c0k\n2\n2\n(cos 2\u03c0k\n.\nN \u2212 \u03bb) (cos N \u2212 \u03bb) + \u03b3 sin N\nThe XY model exhibits three regions of criticality. The\nXX region of criticality is defined by the following conditions: \u03b3 = 0 and \u03bb \u2208 (\u22121, 1); the XY regions of criticality\nare given by the two planes defined by \u03bb = \u00b11, and the Ising\nregion of criticality is defined by \u03b3 = 1.\nWe want to show that the XX region of criticality is characterized by the existence of a non-contractible Berry phase.\nThe critical phenomena in the XX region are given by the\nexistence of the gapless excitations defined by b\u0302\u2020k0 , where\n0\n= \u03bb, which is a consequence of the condition\ncos 2\u03c0k\nN\n\u039bk0 = 0. Note that, as k0 \u2208 {1, . . . M }, the above condition can, for a general \u03bb \u2208 (\u22121, 1), satisfied in thermodynamical limit (N \u2192 \u221e) only. In the continuum limit we define\nx \u2261 limN \u2192\u221e 2\u03c0k/N and hence we have cos x0 = \u03bb. So, as\nlong as M remains finite, we have [18]\nlim cos \u03b8k = \u00b11\n\n(4)\n\nj\nThen |F\u0303\u03bc\u03bd\n| diverges in \u03bb0 and because the numerator of\nEq.(3) will now diverge like N (n)2 , this implies again that\n2\nlim\u03bb\u2192\u03bb0 \u2206E = 0.\nExample: the XY spin chain.- In this section we show\na remarkable example illustrating how a non-contractible sequence of Berry phases reveals quantum criticalities. Let us\nconsider as an example the XY model. It represents onedimensional anisotropic spin chain subjected to an external\nfield along the z axis. The system is given by the following\nHamiltonian H(\u03b3, \u03bb):\n\n\u0013\n\n(7)\n\n\u03b3\u21920\n\nFor \u03b3 = 0, the ground state is hence given by the set\nof conditions:N cos \u03b8k = sgn(\u03b5\nNk ) = \u00b11, i.e., |g(\u03bb, \u03b3 =\n0, \u03c6; M )i = k<k0 |0ik |0i\u2212k k>k0 |1ik |1i\u2212k . The Berry\nphase acquired by the ground state of the system upon adiabatic change of the parameter \u03c6 from 0 to \u03c0 (with \u03bb and \u03b3\nfixed) can be easily calculated if we observe that the ground\nstate has a formal structure of a tensor product of pure states of\nM qubits, each defined by the angles \u03b8k and \u03c6. Then, the overall Berry phase is just the sum of M one-qubit Berry phases\n(note that, although \u03c6 \u2208 [0, \u03c0], each qubit state makes one\ncomplete loop in parameter space due to the 2 factor in the\nexponent):\nM\n\n\u03c0\n\nM\n\nX\nX\n\u2202\n\u03c0(1 \u2212 cos \u03b8k ) =\n\u03c6k\n|gi =\n\u2202\u03c6\n0\nk=1\nk=1\n(8)\nwhere by \u03c6k \u2261 \u03c0(1 \u2212 cos \u03b8k ) we denote a single-qubit Berry\nphase, defined by the number k. Using the expression for the\n\u03c6(M ) = \u2212i\n\nZ\n\nhg|\n\n\f4\nground state and Eq.(7) we find that, for all k and every finite\nM,\nlim \u03c6k = 0, 2\u03c0\n\n\u03b3\u21920\n\n(9)\n\nand henceforth \u03c6(|gi) = 0, 2\u03c0. So for finite M , the Berry\nphase acquired by the ground state is always trivial. Nevertheless, in the thermodynamical limit, there is always a solution\nfor cos \u03b8k0 = 0 \u21d4 cos x0 = \u03bb. This implies that \u03c6k0 = \u03c0 for\nevery \u03b3 > 0 and hence lim\u03b3\u21920 \u03c6k0 = \u03c0. Direct calculation\nshows that Eq.(8) and (9) imply\nlim lim\n\n\u03b3\u21920 M\u2192\u221e\n\n1\n\u03c6(M ) 6= 0\nM\n\n(10)\n\nso the sequence {\u03c6\u03b3n (M )}n\u2208N is non contractible in the thermodynamic limit and therefore the XX criticality is detected\nby a non-contractible Berry phase. In a recent work, Carollo and Pachos [7] have computed the difference of the Berry\nphases acquired by the ground state and the first excited state\nfor loops around the XX region of criticality and found that\nthis relative Berry phase is non trivial and converges to \u2212\u03c0 as\n\u03b3 tends to zero. This is because this relative Berry phase is,\nin the limit \u03b3 \u2192 0, the one (with opposite sign) taken by the\nsingle equatorial qubit defined by k0 .\nConclusions and perspectives.- In a critical system near\nzero temperature quantum fluctuations, due to the Heisenberg\nprinciple, can drive transitions between one phase and another, that is from one internal order to another one.

At very low\ntemperatures, the internal order of strongly correlated systems\nlike systems with strongly correlated electrons consists of the\npattern of how the electrons move with respect to each other\nand there can be different phases with the very same symmetries. Novel notions like quantum and topological order have\nbeen proposed [16].The world of quantum orders is a very rich\nand largely unexplored field of quantum physics and it would\nbe intriguing to use Berry phases to distinguish different quantum or topological orders, like a string-condensed state from\none without string condensation.\nAcknowledgments.- After the main part of this work was\ncompleted, the author became aware of the work of S.-L.
