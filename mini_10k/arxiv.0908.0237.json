The basic physical mechanisms for control of atomic motion are magnetic trapping [5] and optical dipole trapping [6]. Different geometries of trapping fields were considered already,\nfrom the simplest one, based upon 1D sinusoidal standing\nwave, formed by two counter-propagating laser beams,\nto 3D artificial kagome potential landscape built by specially arranged tilted laser beams configuration [3]. Such\nan artificial potential lattices provide a rich opportunities for analog modeling of many-body quantum systems\ne.g. Mott insulator transition [7], quantum Hall effect\n[8\u201310], frustrated quantum antiferromagnets [3]. The antiferromanetic phase is considered as an essential counterpart of high temperature superconductivity (HTSC)\n[11]. Recently the persistent currents in toroidal \"blue\"\ndetuned traps were reported [12]. The pinning of the\nco-directed superfluid vortices in different potential configurations was analyzed with variational wavefunctions\nin order to calculate vortex interaction energies and it\nwas shown that the most favorable allocations of vortices are at maxima of the lattice potential [13]. On the\nother hand the elementary excitations of trapped ultracold gases, namely abelian and nonabelian anyons were\nproposed as a promising tool for error-tolerant quantum\ncomputing [14]. Noteworthy the recent the mutual control of the matter waves by light and vice versa demonstrated recently [16].\nThe interesting feature of an optical trapping by laser\nbeams with wavefront dislocations is a possibility of guiding an atomic motion via non-potential optical fields i.e.\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress:\nURL: http://www.gpi.ru/~ okulov\n\nokulov@kapella.gpi.ru;\n\nby virtue of the optical vortices. Initially the elementary optical vortices like Laguerre-Gaussian beams (LG)\nwere considered as toroidal traps for red detuned cold\natoms [17] or hollow \"tubes\" under blue detuning from\nresonance [18, 19]. For a red detuned trap of toroidal\ngeometry [17] the optical torque had been predicted [20]\nwhich leads to angular acceleration of trapped atoms.\nIn the absence of optical torque the macroscopic quantum state of BEC in toroidal trap had been studied by\nvariational approach and a wavefunction in the form of\nLG vortex spiral was obtained [21]. Classical dynamics of an atom trapped by helical EM-fields guided by a\nnano-fiber has been shown recently to exhibit spiral motion outwards the beam axis as a result of optical torque\n[22].The formation and acceleration of matter wave solitons in toroidal quasi-1D ring trap due to effect of an\nazimuthal oscillating electric field had been studied [23].\nThe vortex-antivortex pairs in two-transverse dimensions\nin non-rotating BEC traps of pancake geometry were obtained numerically [24]. The subject of the present article\nis an investigation of the structure of a BEC wavefunction in non \u2212 potential spatially periodic field composed\nof overlapping optical vortices [25]. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the optical dipole\ntrap composed of overlapping LG vortices. In section 3\nthe results for conservative (potential or gradient) and\ndissipative (radiation pressure) forces on two-level atom\nwith electrical dipole transition are summarized. Section\n4 connects the classical tensors of electromagnetic momentum and angular momentum with forces and torques\non moving atom. In Section 5 the procedure of separation of variables for 3D Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE)\nis outlined along with numerical solution for 2D vortexantivortex wavefunction. The procedure of separation\nof variables is closely connected to existence of different\nspatial scales in GPE for pancake trap geometry, namely\nlongitudinal lz , transversal l\u22a5 and healing length \u03be. The\nhealing length \u03be appears as effective nonlinear scale related to cubic term in GPE [2] as a condition of a balance\nbetween kinetic energy (\"quantum pressure\") and inter-\n\n\f2\nII. CONFIGURATION OF AN OPTICAL\nLABYRINTH TRAP FOR NEUTRAL ATOMS.\n\nThe rectangular optical vortex lattices are spontaneously formed in diode-pumped microchip lasers with\nslightly focusing output coupler in a wide range of experimental parameters [29]. The optical patterns observed in\nthis experiment are nonlinear eigenmodes of Fabry-Perot\nresonator with sufficiently large Fresnel numberNf r =\nkD2\nLr , ranging from 100 to 1000 : , where k = 2\u03c0/\u03bb ,\nLr is optical length of cavity, D is diameter of optically\npumped area inside host crystal which is approximately\nequal to diameter of generated optical array. It is convenient to approximate the laser eigenmode obtained numerically [30] and experimentally [29] as a superposition\nof co-propagating and overlapping LG's with the unit\ntopological charges [25]:\nE(~r, z = 0) \u2248 E0 exp [\u2212\nFIG. 1: The isointensity lines for the superposition of toroidal\noptical traps. Each elementary trap is LG beam propagating\nalong Z- axis. The hyperboloidal surfaces are the loci of the\nmaxima of intensity. The rings at the LG beams bottlenecks\nare the isophotes which corresponds to a maxima of a light\nintensity. Their diameter is chosen close to experimentally observed in [29], namely d \u2248 30\u03bcm, wavelength \u03bb\u22480.8\u00f71.06\u03bcm,\nD \u2248 180\u03bcm.\n\naction energy (two-body interaction):\n\n\u03be=\n\np\n1/8\u03c0nas ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere n \u2248 |\u03a8|2 is average density of a quantum\ngas, as\np\nis the s-wave scattering length. The lz,\u22a5 = (~/m\u03c9z,\u22a5 )\nare often referred to as a characteristic widths (longitudinal and transversal respectively) of the ground state of\nharmonic oscillator for parabolic traps. In pancake geometry considered below the following inequality is valid\n[26, 27]:\n\n|~r \u2212 ~rjx ,jy | 2\n+ i lEM Arg(~r \u2212 ~rjx,jy ) ], (3)\nd2\nwhere jx, jy are integer indices for positions of elementary LG vortices spanned with period p in (z = 0, x, y)\n- plane, d is diameter of the bottleneck of LG and lEM\nis topological charge of elementary LG optical vortex,\n~r = (x, y) is a vector in transverse plane, ~rjx,jy is a vector\nindicating positions of elementary vortices. The resulting interference pattern obtained via superposition (3)\nis ordered in \"antiferromagnet\"-like lattice with angular\nmomenta alternating from one site to another(fig.1) [31].\nSuch 2D periodic optical vortex array forms a superposition of multiply connected toroidal optical traps (fig.\n2). The motion of cold atoms is controlled by combined\naction of optical dipole force [6] and radiation pressure\nforce [20, 22]. Alternative useful approximation for optical field is is a superposition of the several major Fourier\ncomponents [34] using e.g. exact formula for free space\npropagation of periodical optical field from [35]:\n\u00d7 exp [\u2212\n\nE(~r, z) \u2248 E0 exp [ikz \u2212\nexp [ i2\u03c0{\n\nlz < l\u22a5 < \u03be.\n\n(2)\n\nThis allows to separate z and ~r\u22a5 variables in GPE\nand factorize [23, 25, 28] or in other terms employ multiple scale expansion [26] to the 3D wavefunction \u03a8 to\ndecouple it in a product of longitudinal \u03a8z and transversal \u03a8\u22a5 wavefunctions.

One\nround trip around the axis of a given helix in the x, y - plane\nmeans the 2\u03c0 change of the optical phase. The perfect match\nof helical wavefronts between adjacent vortices is seen clearly.\nThe trapped dipole moves upstairs the helicoid, the radius of\nrotation is gradually increased due to torque. The passage\nfrom one helix to another is possible due to perfect match of\nadjacent helical surfaces.\n\n~ 12 * E\n~ ( z, ~r) = G(z, ~r)exp(i\u0398(z, ~r));\nf\u223c\n=D\nZt\n\u2032\n\u2032\nsin(\u2206t /2)\n,\nIS (t) = exp [i\u2206t /2]\n\u2206/2\n\n~ 12 is electric dipole matrix element of the twowhere D\nlevel transition, \u2206 = \u03c90 \u2212 \u03c9 + \u03b4 is a detuning and \u03b4 is\ngiven by:\n\u03b4=\n\n1 h hPi * \u2207f + \u2207f * hPi i\n.\n2M\nf\n0\n\nThe knowledge of a particular spatial distribution of\n~\nE(z, ~r) permits the explicit calculation of the expectation\n\u02c6\nvalues of F~ i.e. classical force F~ on resonant atom with an\nelectrical dipole transition.
