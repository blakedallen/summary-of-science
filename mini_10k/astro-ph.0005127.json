The excellent soft X-ray sensitivity of the\nPSPC detector (Pfeffermann et al. 1987) onboard the ROSAT satellite (Tr\u00fcmper\n1983), the ROSAT All-Sky Survey data (Voges et al. 1999), and deep ROSAT\nPSPC and HRI pointed observations provided the best opportunities to study\nNLS1s before the launches of XMM-Newton and Chandra. ROSAT observations have triggered the rapid growth in the definition of the phenomenological\nparameters of NLS1s throughout the electromagnetic spectrum, as well as the\ntheoretical modeling of their exciting properties. This is clearly demonstrated\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier Preprint\n\n11 June 2018\n\n\fwith the papers presented in these proceedings. Fifteen years after the definition of the peculiar optical properties of NLS1s (see the review article of\nPogge), followed by a period in which their importance had been suggested\n(e.g. Halpern & Oke 1987; Stephens 1989; Puchnarewicz et al. 1992), NLS1s\nnow represent an important class of the AGN family, holding many keys to\nour understanding of the problems posed by the Seyfert phenomenon.\n\n2\n\nThe story of IRAS 13224\u20133809\n\nMy NLS1 research started in 1992 with a ROSAT PSPC AO-2 pointed observation of IRAS 13224\u20133809. The object was proposed for a ROSAT pointed\nobservation because the ROSAT All-Sky Survey observations showed an unusually large X-ray luminosity for a Seyfert 2 classification, as given at the\ntime in the literature. The remarkable X-ray luminosity of a few 1044 erg s\u22121\nwas confirmed in the ROSAT pointed observations, and, most surprisingly, we\nfound a light curve with unusually rapid and large-amplitude variability for a\nradio-quiet AGN. The shortest doubling time was only 800 seconds, and the\nmaximum variability amplitude was about a factor of 4 within a few hours. All\nthis happened in mid-December 1992, and we thought it would be useful to\ntake an optical spectrum of this potentially important Seyfert galaxy. I went to\nESO and talked with Bob Fosbury on this matter. One of his colleagues, Adline Caulet, was observing during Christmas time at the ESO 3.6 m telescope\nusing the EFOSC spectrograph, and she actually took the first high-sensitivity\nspectrum of IRAS 13224\u20133809 on December 24, 1992. The spectrum showed a\nnarrow H\u03b2 line of less than about 1000 km s\u22121 FWHM and extremely strong\nFe II multiplet emission lines around 4500 \u00c5 and 5200 \u00c5. Therefore, the new\noptical observations revealed the NLS1 nature of IRAS 13224\u20133809, and we\nfound the first clear instance of strong and rapid X-ray variability in a NLS1.\nDuring 1993\u20131994, Henner Fink and I worked out the spectral properties of\na few other NLS1 galaxies by comparing the ROSAT spectral slopes and the\nFWHM of H\u03b2 for NLS1s and broad-line Seyfert 1 galaxies from the Walter &\nFink (1993) sample. We saw the first indications of an increasing spread of the\nsoft X-ray spectral slopes with decreasing line widths for Seyfert 1 galaxies.\nThe breakthrough in determining the soft X-ray properties of NLS1s began\nin the middle of 1994. After I gave a talk at the Institute of Astronomy in\nCambridge, U.K., Andy Fabian told me that a student of his, Niel Brandt, was\nalso working on the X-ray properties of NLS1s (e.g. Akn 564) and had found\nsimilar results, and he asked me to talk with him. This was the beginning of\na most constructive collaboration, and within a couple of months we actually\ncame up with our 'Figure 8' showing the relation between the soft X-ray slope\nand the FWHM of the H\u03b2 line (Boller, Brandt & Fink 1996).\n\n2\n\n\f3\n\nNLS1s as an extreme of Seyfert activity\n\nNLS1s were found to exhibit extreme properties when compared with broadline Seyfert 1 galaxies. Many NLS1s show\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nA giant soft X-ray excess up to \u2248 1.5 keV\nA larger than previously thought power-law slope diversity\nRapid and large-amplitude variability\nIndications of a highly ionized accretion disk\nIndications of a cooler accretion disk corona\n\nFig. 1. Schematic illustrations of the broad-band spectral energy distributions of\nNLS1s (left panel) and broad-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (right panel). The right panel\nis based on an idea of A.C. Fabian. NLS1s often show extreme soft X-ray excess\nstrengths and unusually steep power-law X-ray continua.\n\nComparison of the schematic broad-band X-ray energy distributions shown in\nFig. 1 illustrates the extreme soft X-ray excess and the generally steeper hard\nX-ray continua of NLS1s. The hard power-law slope diversity of NLS1s was\ndiscovered by Brandt, Mathur & Elvis (1997). Indications of an ionized Fe K\u03b1\nline are found in the NLS1 Ton S180 (Comastri et al. 1998). In the case of a\ncooler accretion disk corona, steeper power-law slopes are expected due to the\nsmaller energy increase per scattering of an ultraviolet or soft X-ray photon. A\ncooler accretion disk corona might be due to stronger cooling by the huge soft\nX-ray excess photon density. Accepted XMM-Newton observations of carefully\nselected NLS1s are expected to shed further light on these issues.\n\n3\n\n\f4\n\nOptical emission-line correlations with X-ray continuum slopes\n\n4.1 Correlations between the soft and hard X-ray continuum slopes and the\nFWHM of H\u03b2\n\nA strong relation between the ROSAT photon index and the FWHM of the H\u03b2\nline has been detected in Seyfert 1 galaxies (e.g. Boller, Brandt & Fink 1996;\nsee the left panel of Fig. 2). While Seyfert 1 galaxies with H\u03b2 FWHM greater\nthan 3000 km s\u22121 have their photon indices confined to a fairly narrow range,\nwith a mean value of about 2.3, NLS1s show an extremely large diversity in\ntheir values of the photon index, reaching values of up to about 5. A region\nwith values of the photon index above about 3 and H\u03b2 FWHM > 3000 km s\u22121\nis not occupied by Seyfert 1 galaxies, and it appears that Seyfert galaxies\nare not allowed to exist in this 'zone of avoidance.' In the ROSAT energy\nband, the photon index serves as a measure of the relative contributions of\nthe soft X-ray excess emission and the underlying power law. Sources with\nhigh values of photon index are therefore thought to show the strongest soft\nexcess emission. The H\u03b2 FWHM is a measure of the velocity dispersion in\nthe Broad Line Region. The soft X-ray emission probably arises within a few\nSchwarzschild radii of the central black hole in the accretion disk, and the\nemission from the Broad Line Region arises at significantly larger distances\n(light days to light years; see the paper by Peterson in these proceedings).\nTherefore, the correlation between these quantities suggests that the emission\nfrom the accretion disk determines the velocity dispersion of the line emitting\nclouds in the Broad Line Region.\nA similar correlation has been discovered by Brandt, Mathur & Elvis (1997)\nbetween the ASCA 2\u201310 keV photon index and the FWHM of H\u03b2. NLS1s\nagain show a larger diversity in the distribution of their photon indices than\nbroad-line Seyfert 1 galaxies. In the 2\u201310 keV energy band, the spectral energy\ndistribution is dominated by the power-law contribution, which is thought to\nbe primarily formed through Compton scattering processes in the accretion\ndisk corona. A complete understanding of the steeper 2\u201310 keV X-ray continua\nin NLS1s has not emerged up to now (see Section 3).\n\n4.2 Seyfert 1 unification through physical processes\n\nA whole set of correlations between the X-ray spectral and timing properties\nand optical emission-line properties have now been detected among Seyfert 1\ngalaxies. The optical emission-line properties include the FWHM of H\u03b2, the\nstrength of the optical Fe ii emission (relative to H\u03b2) and the [O III] \u03bb5007\n4\n\n\fFig. 2. Left Figure (a): Photon index in the 0.1\u20132.4 keV energy range as a function\nof the FWHM of the H\u03b2 line. The photon index serves as a measurement of the\nsteepness of the X-ray continuum. All objects in the diagram are Seyfert 1 galaxies.\nThe NLS1s (H\u03b2 line widths < 2000 km s\u22121 ) are taken from Boller, Brandt & Fink\n(1996). The broad-line Seyfert 1 galaxies were investigated by Walter & Fink (1993).\nA significant correlation between the slope of the X-ray continuum and the FWHM\nof H\u03b2 is found. Seyfert 1 galaxies with large line widths (FWHM H\u03b2 > 2000 km s\u22121 )\nshow a relatively small dispersion in their values of the photon index with a mean\nof about 2.3. NLS1s show a strong dispersion in their values of the photon index.\nSome of these objects exhibit values of the photon index up to about 5. A region of\nthe diagram, with values of the photon index larger than 3 and optical line widths\nlarger than about 3000 km s\u22121 , is not occupied by Seyfert 1 galaxies. This region is\nsometimes called the 'zone of avoidance.' Right figure (b): Photon index in the\n2\u201310 keV energy range as a function of the FWHM of H\u03b2 (Brandt, Mathur & Elvis\n1997). The measurements were obtained with the Japanese X-ray satellite ASCA.\nIn the hard X-ray energy range, NLS1s show a stronger dispersion in their photon\nindices than previously thought. Typical values of the photon index in the hard\nX-ray energy band range between about 1.7 and 2.6.\n\nstrength. A compilation of X-ray and optical emission-line parameters is given\nin Table 1. Plausible qualitative interpretations of the strong soft X-ray excess\nobserved in many NLS1s include a higher Eddington accretion rate and/or\nlower black hole masses. Comptonization may play a role in explaining the\nsteep 2\u201310 keV power-law slopes found in NLS1s. The postulated higher ionizing photon density from a higher temperature accretion disk might explain\nthe larger size of the Broad Line Regions in NLS1s (see the paper of Peterson\net al. in these proceedings). Boroson & Green (1992) argued that a toroidal\ndistribution of the Broad Line Region clouds might prevent ionizing radiation\n5\n\n\ffrom reaching the planar Narrow Line Region (photon screening). This might\ncause the weak [O III] emission seen in NLS1s. Relativistic Doppler boosting\neffects or X-ray flares above the accretion disk might explain the rapid and\ngiant amplitude variability detected in some NLS1s (see Section 5).\nTable 1\nSet of X-ray and optical correlations among Seyfert 1 galaxies (columns 1 and 3).\nPlausible underlying physical parameters are listed in column 2.\nBroad-line Seyfert 1\n\nphysical parameter\n\nNarrow-line Seyfert 1\n\nWeak soft X-ray excess\n\n\u1e40 , M\n\nStrong soft X-ray excess\n\nFlat power-law slope\n\nComptonization\n\nSteep power-law slope\n\nBroad permitted lines\n\nIonizing photon density\n\nNarrow permitted lines\n\nWeak Fe ii\nStrong [O III]\nModerate X-ray variability\n\n5\n\nCooler corona?\n\nStrong Fe ii\n\nP hoton screening?\n\nWeak [O III]\n\nRelativistic ef f ects?\n\nExtreme X-ray variability\n\nThe extreme X-ray variability of NLS1s\n\nIn this section I concentrate on the most extreme cases of X-ray variability\ndetected in radio-quiet AGN, i.e. variability with an amplitude above a factor\nof about 10 in combination with timescales of less than about one day.

The objects discussed below are the NLS1s\nIRAS 13224\u20133809, PHL 1092 and 1ES 1927+654.\n\n5.1 The persistent rapid and giant X-ray variability of IRAS 13224\u20133809\nThe first systematic X-ray monitoring campaign for a NLS1 was performed in\n1996 on IRAS 13224\u20133809. All relevant details are discussed in Boller et al.\n(1997). The most important observational facts can be summarized as: (1) the\ndetection of multiple strong flaring events; (2) the most extreme variability\nover time is about a factor of 57 in just two days; (3) the light curve appears\nto be nonlinear or non-Gaussian in character; (4) changes in the accretion rate\nor the ionization state of a warm absorber are not considered plausible explanations for the extreme variability; (5) the most probable explanations include\nstrong Doppler boosting effects arising from temperature inhomogeneities in\nthe accretion disk (see Sunyaev 1973; Guilbert, Fabian & Rees 1993) or partial\nobscuration by Compton thick matter (see the paper by Brandt & Gallagher in\n6\n\n\fthese proceedings). In Fig. 3 the ROSAT HRI light curve of IRAS 13224\u20133809\nobtained in 1996 is shown.\n\nFig. 3. ROSAT HRI light curve of IRAS 13224\u22123809 obtained during a 30-day\nmonitoring campaign between January 11, 1996 and February 9, 1996. The abscissa\ngives the Julian date minus 2450093.523 days. The dashed line shows the background\ncount rate as a function of time. At least 5 giant-amplitude variations are clearly\nvisible. IRAS 13224\u22123809 shows the most extreme X-ray variability measured thus\nfar from active galactic nuclei.\n\n5.2 The large efficiency limit derived from the ROSAT HRI light curve of\nPHL 1092\nIn Figure 4 the ROSAT HRI light curve of PHL 1092, a luminous narrow-line\nquasar, is shown. The largest variability amplitude is about a factor of 14\n(see Brandt et al. 1999). The most extreme variability event has \u2206L/\u2206t >\n1.3 * 1042 erg s\u22122 , resulting in an extremely high efficiency of \u03b7 > 0.62 \u00b1 0.13.\nThe ROSAT HRI observation of PHL 1092 therefore further supports the\npresence of relativistic motions of the X-ray emitting gas causing giant and\nrapid flux variations in NLS1s.\n5.3 The persistent, rapid and giant X-ray variability of the X-ray bright Einstein NLS1 1ES 1927+654\nWith a mean 0.1\u20132.4 keV count rate of 1.26 \u00b1 0.026 counts s\u22121 , 1ES 1927+654\nis one of brightest AGN detected in the ROSAT All-Sky Survey. Most inter7\n\n\fFig. 4. ROSAT HRI light curve of PHL 1092 obtained during an 18-day observation\nbetween July 16, 1997 and August 2, 1997. The abscissa gives the Julian date minus\n2450645.120 days. The dashed line gives the background count rate as a function of\ntime.\n\nestingely, unusually large and persistent variability is detected, making this\nobject, behind IRAS 13224\u20133809 (Boller et al. 1997), the second radio-quiet\nAGN showing this type of variability. 1ES 1927+654 was observed during\n\nFig. 5. ROSAT All-Sky Survey light curve of 1ES 1927+654 obtained between 1990\nJuly 11\u201316 (left panel) and 1990 December 11\u201321 (right panel). Persistent, rapid\nand giant X-ray variability is detected throughout the ROSAT PSPC observations.\nThe maximum factor of variability is about 17.\n\n8\n\n\fthe 'mini-survey' for about 5 days between 1990 July 11 and 16 with a total exposure time of 254 seconds. During the normal survey scan operations,\n1ES 1927+654 was observed for about 11 days between 1990 December 11\nand 21. Unusually strong deviations from the mean count rate are detected in\nthe ROSAT All-Sky Survey observations. Figure 5 shows the ROSAT PSPC\nlight curve of 1ES 1927+654. The left panel refers to the 'mini-survey' observations in July 1990 and the right panel gives the count rate variations during\nthe survey scan observations in December 1990. Summing the six data points\nbelow a count rate of 0.2 counts s\u22121 results in a lower count rate level of 0.146\ncounts s\u22121 . Similarly, summing the three data points above 2.4 counts s\u22121\nresults in an upper count rate level of 2.51 counts s\u22121 , the amplitude of variability is about 17. Between days 154.017 and 154.150 the count rate increases\nfrom 0.28 \u00b1 0.212 to 1.90 \u00b1 0.43 counts s\u22121 , corresponding to a factor of about\n8 within only 3.2 hours.\n\nFig. 6. ROSAT PSPC light curve of 1ES 1927+654 obtained on 1998 December 8. A\nstrong X-ray flare lasting for about 100 s is detected near the end of the observations.\nThe corresponding isotropic energy is \u2248 1046 erg.\n\n1ES 1927+654 was observed with the PSPC detector during the final observation period of the ROSAT satellite on December 8, 1998 (Figure 6). Using\na bin size of 10 seconds, a strong X-ray flare becomes apparent between 1110\nand 1280 seconds after the beginning of the observations. The count rate variations significantly exceed that of the variations caused by the ROSAT wobble.\nThe isotropic energy emitted in this strong X-ray flare is E = 1.7 * 1046 erg.\n1ES 1927+654 is most probably another example showing the presence of\nrelativistic motions of X-ray emitting gas in the nuclei of NLS1s.\n\n9\n\n\f6\n\nSummary\n\nGreat progress in defining the observational properties of NLS1s has been\nachieved based on ROSAT and ASCA observations. The observations have\nshown many NLS1s to have characteristic, unique and extreme X-ray properties. These include the strongest soft X-ray excess emission seen in Seyfert 1\ngalaxies, steep 2\u201310 keV power-law continua, and extremely rapid and largeamplitude X-ray variability. The extreme properties of NLS1s have additionally stimulated the theoretical modeling of many aspects of Seyfert activity.\n\n7\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe idea to organize a workshop on NLS1s began in June 1997 at the 'GermanJapanese Workshop on Sky Surveys' in Potsdam, during a discussion with Niel\nBrandt and Martin Ward. In early 1999 we finally decided to organize such\na workshop. G\u00fcnther Hasinger suggested to me that I send an application to\nthe Wilhelm and Else Heraeus Stiftung to support the workshop, which in\nMay 1999 turned out to be successful. Therefore, on behalf of the scientific\norganizing committee, I would like to thank the WE-Heraeus Stiftung for their\nfinancial and organizational support. I am especially grateful to Dr. E. Dreisigacker and Mrs. J. Lang for their constructive and effective help in preparing\nthe workshop. I would like to thank the Physikzentrum Bad Honnef, and especially Dr. DeBrus, for help finding accommodation outside the Physikzentrum and support during the workshop. The scientific success of this joint\nMPE, AIP, ESO workshop is due mainly to the work of the scientific organizing committee: Jacqueline Bergeron (ESO), Niel Brandt (Penn State, USA),\nSuzy Collin-Souffrin (France), Reinhard Genzel (MPE), Dirk Grupe (MPE),\nG\u00fcnther Hasinger (AIP), Karen Leighly (Columbia, USA), Hagai Netzer (Tel\nAviv, Israel), Joachim Tr\u00fcmper (MPE), Marie-Helene Ulrich (ESO) and Martin Ward (Leicester, UK). On behalf of the scientific organizing committee, I\nwould like to thank all the participants for attending the workshop, for their\ninput to the scientific discussions, and for submitting their specific contributions, which we believe will be of great scientific interest for the astronomical\ncommunity at large.\n\n10\n\n\fReferences\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n\nBoller Th., Brandt W.N., Fink H., 1996, Astronomy & Astrophysics 305\n(1996) 53\nBoller Th., Brandt W.N., Fabian A.C., Fink H., Monthly Notices Royal\nAcademic Society 289 (1997) 393\nBoroson T.A. & Green R.F., The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series 80 (1992) 109\nBrandt W.N., Mathur S., Elvis M., Monthly Notices Royal Academic\nSociety 285 (1997) 25\nBrandt W.N., Boller T., Fabian A.C., & Ruszkowski M., Monthly Notices\nRoyal Academic Society 303 (1999) L53\nComastri A., Fiore F., Guainazzi M., et al., Astronomy & Astrophysics\n333 (1998) 31\nGuilbert P.W., Fabian A.C., Rees M.J., Monthly Notices Royal Academic\nSociety 205 (1983) 593\nHalpern J. & Oke J.B., The Astrophysical Journal 312 (1987) 91\nPfeffermann E., Briel U.G., Hippmann H., Kettenring G., Metzner G.,\nPredehl P., Reger G., Stephan K.-H., Zombeck M.V., Chappell J.,\nPresented at the Society for Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers\n(SPIE), Berlin (1987)\nPuchnarewicz E.M., Branduardi-Raymont G., Mason K.
