If\n(1.1) forms an m-cover of G but none of its proper subsystems does, then\nit is said to be a minimal (or an irredundant) m-cover of G. A cover of\nG refers to a 1-cover of G, and a disjoint cover (or partition) of G means\nan exact 1-cover of G. Obviously an exact m-cover is a minimal m-cover\nand any minimal m-cover has covering multiplicity m. Disjoint covers of\ngeneral groups were investigated by I. Korec [K74], M. M. Parmenter [P84]\nand R. Brandl [Br90], while exact m-covers of groups were studied by the\nauthor in [S01] and [S04b].\nIf (1.1) forms a minimal cover of a group G, then all the Gi have finite\nindex in G by B. H. Neumann [N54a, N54b], and furthermore\n\u0014\n\nG:\n\nk\n\\\n\ni=1\n\n\u0015\n\nGi 6 k!\n\n(1.3)\n\nby M. J. Tomkinson [T87]. The author [S90] observed that this still holds\nif (1.1) is a minimal m-cover of a group G.\nHere we give a simple way to explain why [G : Gi ] < \u221e for all i =\n1, . . . , k provided that (1.1) is a minimal m-cover of a group G. For any\nj \u2208 [1, k], there is an x \u2208 aj Gj with |[1, k]\u2217 (x)| = m. Choose a minimal\nI \u2286 ([1, k] \\ [1, k]\u2217 (x)) \u222a {j} such that {ai Gi }i\u2208I is a cover of G, then we\nmust have j \u2208 I and hence [G : Gj ] < \u221e by Neumann's result.\nNeumann's basic result has applications in Galois theory, group rings,\nBanach spaces, projective geometry and Riemann surfaces (cf. [SV]).\nConcerning covers of groups by infinitely many cosets, Tomkinson [T86]\nproved that if a group G is irredundantly covered by \u03ba > \u05d00 left cosets\nai Gi then [G : Gi ] 6 2\u03ba for each i and hence\n\u0014\n\\ \u0015 Y\nG:\nGi 6\n[G : Gi ] 6 (2\u03ba )\u03ba = 2\u03ba .\ni\n\ni\n\nAny infinite cyclic group is isomorphic to the additive group Z of integers. The subgroups of Z different from {0} are in the form nZ = {nx :\nx \u2208 Z} where n \u2208 Z+ = {1, 2, 3, . . . }. For any positive integer n, the index\nof nZ in Z is n and a coset of nZ in Z is just a residue class\na + nZ = {x \u2208 Z : x \u2261 a (mod n)} (a \u2208 Z).\nThe study of cover of Z in the form\nA = {ai + ni Z}ki=1\n\n(1.4)\n\nwas initiated by P. Erd\u00f6s ([E50]) in the early 1930s, who viewed this topic\nas his most favorite one (cf. [E97]). Since then many researchers have\n\n\fFINITE COVERS OF GROUPS BY COSETS OR SUBGROUPS\n\n3\n\ninvestigated such covers of Z (cf. [G04] and [PS]). A simple example of\ncover of Z with distinct moduli is\n{2Z, 3Z, 1 + 4Z, 5 + 6Z, 7 + 12Z}.\nM. Z. Zhang [Z91] showed that for each m = 2, 3, . . . there are infinitely\nmany exact m-covers of Z which cannot be split into an exact n-cover of Z\n(with 0 < n < m) and an exact (m\u2212n)-cover of Z. The author investigated\nm-covers of Z and exact m-covers of Z in a series of papers (see, e.g., [S97,\nS99, S03a, S04a]). Covering multiplicity plays an important role in the\nauthor's unification of zero-sum problems, subset sums and covers of Z\n(cf. [S03b]).\nLet H be a subnormal subgroup of a group G with finite index. Define\nd(G, H) =\n\nn\nX\n\n(|Hi /Hi\u22121 | \u2212 1)\n\n(1.5)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere H = H0 \u2282 H1 \u2282 * * * \u2282 Hn = G is a composition series from H to\nG. (d(G, G) is regarded as 0.) By [S90, Theorem 6] we have\n[G : H] \u2212 1 > d(G, H) > f ([G : H]) > log2 [G : H],\n\n(1.6)\n\nhere the Mycielski function f : Z+ \u2192 N = {0, 1, 2, . . . } is given by\nf\n\n\u0012Y\nr\n\nt=1\n\nt\np\u03b1\nt\n\n\u0013\n\n=\n\nr\nX\n\n\u03b1t (pt \u2212 1)\n\n(1.7)\n\nt=1\n\nwhere p1 , . . . , pr are distinct primes and \u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1r \u2208 N. In [S01] the\nauthor showedTthat d(G, H) = f ([G : H]) if and only if G/HG is solvable,\nwhere HG = g\u2208G gHg \u22121 is the largest normal subgroup of G contained\nin H.\nHere is the main result of [S01] on exact m-covers of groups.\nTheorem 1.1 (Z. W. Sun, 2001). Let (1.1) be an exact m-cover of a group\nG by left cosets.\n(i) Whenever G/(Gi )G is solvable, we have k > m + f ([G : Gi ]).\n(ii) If all the Gi are subnormal in G, then we have the inequality\n\u0013\n\u0012 \\\nk\nk > m + d G,\nGi ,\n\n(1.8)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere the lower bound is best possible.\nWe now give some historical remarks. When m = 1 and G is abelian,\npart (i) was first conjectured by J. Mycielski (cf. [MS]) and confirmed by\n\n\f4\n\nZHI-WEI SUN\n\n\u0160. Zn\u00e1m [Zn66] in the case G = Z. In 1988 M. A. Berger, A. Felzenbaum\nand A. S. Fraenkel [BFF] proved that if (1.1) forms a disjoint cover of a\nfinite solvable group G then k > 1+f ([G : Gi ]) for any i = 1, . . . , k. When\nm = 1 and G1 , . . . , Gk are normal in G, part (ii) was essentially obtained\nby I. Korec [K74].\nFor general covers of groups, things become more subtle and complicated. By using algebraic number theory and characters of abelian groups,\nG. Lettl and the author [LS] recently obtained the following result.\nTheorem 1.2 (G. Lettl and Z. W. Sun, 2004). Let (1.1) be a minimal mcover of an abelian group G. Then k > m+f ([G : Gi ]) for all i = 1, . . . , k.\nAs Example 1.1 of [LS] shows, we cannot replace the lower bound of k\nTk\nin Theorem 1.2 by m + f ([G : i=1 Gi ]) even if G = Cp \u00d7 Cp where p is\nan odd prime and Cp is the cyclic group of order p.\nDefinition 1.1. Let (1.1) be a finite system of left cosets in a group G. If\n[1, k]\u2217 (G) = {[1, k]\u2217 (x): x \u2208 G} contains I \u2217 (G) for no \u2205 =\n6 I \u2282 [1, k] (i.e.,\n\u2217\nwhenever \u2205 =\n6 I \u2282 [1, k] there is a g \u2208 G such that I (g) 6= [1, k]\u2217 (x) for\nall x \u2208 G), then we call (1.1) a regular system. If (1.1) is regular, and\n[1, k]\u2217 (G) 6\u2287 \u2205\u2217 (G) = {\u2205} (i.e., (1.1) is a cover of G), then we call (1.1) a\nregular cover of G.\nWhen (1.1) is a minimal m-cover of a group G, it forms a regular cover\nof G because for any I \u2282 [1, k] there is a g \u2208 G such that |I \u2217 (g)| < m while\n|[1, k]\u2217 (x)| > m for all x \u2208 G. A regular system may not be a cover, e.g.,\nwe can easily check that {2Z, 4Z, 2 + 4Z} is a regular system of residue\nclasses but it is not a cover of Z. As we will see later, if (1.1) forms a\nregular cover of a group G then all the indices [G : Gi ] must be finite.\nNow we introduce our first result in this paper.\nTheorem 1.3. If (1.1) is a regular cover of a group G, and for any i, j =\n1, . . . , k either Gi and Gj are subnormal in G with [G : Gi ] relatively\nprime to [Gi : Gi \u2229 Gj ], or Gi and Gj are normal in G with G/(Gi \u2229 Gj )\ncyclic, then we have the inequality\n\u0013\n\u0012 \\\nk\nGi .\nk > m(A) + d G,\n\n(1.9)\n\ni=1\n\nRemark 1.1. (a) In view of Example 1.1 of [LS], the conditions of Theorem\n1.3 are essentially indispensable. (b) By Example 1.2 of [S01], for any\nsubnormal subgroup H of G with finite index, there does exist an exact\nTk\nm-cover (1.1) of G such that all the Gi are subnormal in G, i=1 Gi = H\nand k = m + d(G, H).\n\n\fFINITE COVERS OF GROUPS BY COSETS OR SUBGROUPS\n\n5\n\nA subgroup H of a finite group G is called a Hall subgroup of G if\n|H| is relatively prime to [G : H] (i.e., 1 is the greatest common divisor\n(|H|, [G : H]) of |H| and [G : H]). By [S04b, Corollary 2.1], a subnormal\nHall subgroup of G must be normal in G.\nCorollary 1.1. Let (1.1) be a regular cover of a group G. If G is cyclic,\nor G is finite and G1 , . . . , Gk are normal Hall subgroups of G, then (1.9)\nholds.\nProof. This follows from Theorem 1.3 immediately. \u0003\nRemark 1.2. The following consequence of Corollary 1.1 was announced\nby the author in [S01]: Let (1.1) be a minimal m-cover of a group G. If G\nis cyclic, or |G| is squarefree and all the Gi are normal in G, then we have\nthe inequality\n\u0012\u0014\n\u0015\u0013\nk\n\\\nk > m+f G:\nGi .\n(1.10)\ni=1\n\nWhen m = 1 and G = Z, this was conjectured by Zn\u00e1m [Zn75] and\nconfirmed by R. J. Simpson [Si85]; when m = 1 and G is of squarefree\norder, this was proved by Berger, Felzenbaum and Fraenkel [BFF] in 1988.\nRecall that a group G is said to be perfect if it coincides with its derived\ngroup G\u2032 . Here is our second theorem.\nTheorem 1.4. Suppose that {Gi }ki=1 is a minimal m-cover of a group G\nTk\nby subnormal subgroups. Then there is a composition series from i=1 Gi\nto G whose factors are of prime orders, and all the Gi contain every perfect\nsubgroup of G.\nRemark 1.3. (a) Clearly Theorem 1.4 extends the following result of M. A.\nBrodie, R. F. Chamberlain and L.-C. Kappe [BCK]: If {Gi }ki=1 is a minimal\nTk\ncover of a group G by finitely many normal subgroups, then G/ i=1 Gi\nis solvable and all perfect normal subgroups of G are contained in each of\nG1 , . . . , Gk . (b) Any finite non-cyclicSgroup G can be covered by finitely\nmany proper subgroups because G = x\u2208G hxi, but no field can be covered\nby finitely many proper subfields (cf. [BBS]).\nExample 1.1. Let G be a group with G/Z(G) finite, where Z(G) is the\ncenter of G. For x, y \u2208 G, if xy 6= yx then (x\u22121 y)x 6= x(x\u22121 y) and hence\nxZ(G) 6= yZ(G). Let X = {x1 , . . . , xk } be a maximal set of pairwise noncommuting elements of G. Then k = |X| 6 |G/Z(G)|, and {CG (xi )}ki=1\nTk\nforms a minimal cover of G by centralizers with i=1 CG (xi ) = Z(G) (cf.\n[T87, Theorem 5.1]), and |G/Z(G)| 6 ck for some absolute constant c > 0\n(see [Py87]). If G = G/Z(G) is not solvable, then not all the CG (xi ) are\nsubnormal in G by Theorem 1.4. When G is solvable, Tomkinson [T97]\n\n\f6\n\nZHI-WEI SUN\n\nprovided a lower bound of k (conjectured by Cohn [C94]) in terms of a\nchief factor of G. D. R. Mason [M78] proved that |G| > 2k \u2212 2, which was\nconjectured by Erd\u00f6s and E. G. Straus [ES].\nConcerning covers of a group by subnormal subgroups, the author and\nhis student Song Guo have made the following conjecture.\nConjecture 1.1 (S. Guo and Z. W. Sun, 2004). Let {Gi }ki=1 be a minimal\nm-cover of a group G by finitely many subnormal subgroups. Assume\nTk\nQr\nt\nthat [G : i=1 Gi ] = t=1 p\u03b1\nt , where p1 , . . . , pr are distinct primes and\n\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1r are positive integers. Then\nk >m+\n\nr\nX\n\n(\u03b1t \u2212 1)(pt \u2212 1).\n\nt=1\n\nLet H be a subgroup of a group G. When X \u2286 G is a union of finitely\nmany left cosets of H, we use [X : H] to represent the number of left\ncosets of H contained in X, which agrees with the index of H in X if X\nis a subgroup of G. Below is our third result in this paper.\nTheorem 1.5. Let H be a subgroup of a group G with finite index. Suppose that G1 , . . . , Gk are subnormal subgroups of G containing H with\n([G : Gi ], [Gi : H]) = 1 for all i = 1, . . . , k.

In [S90] it was asked whether for any finitely many left\ncosets a1 G1 , . . . , ak Gk in a finite group G we always have (1.12). Later\nTomkinson pointed out that this is not true for the Klein group C2 \u00d7 C2 .\nThe following conjecture of the author seems very challenging.\n\n\fFINITE COVERS OF GROUPS BY COSETS OR SUBGROUPS\n\n7\n\nConjecture 1.2 (Z. W. Sun, 2004). Let a1 G1 , . . . , ak Gk (k > 1) be\nfinitely many pairwise disjoint left cosets in a group G with [G : Gi ] < \u221e\nfor all i = 1, . . . , k. Then ([G : Gi ], [G : Gj ]) > k for some 1 6 i < j 6 k.\nRemark 1.5. (a) The case k = 2 will be handled in Remark 2.2. The\nconjecture remains open even for the additive cyclic group Z.\n(b) Under the condition of Conjecture 1.2, clearly\n\u0015\n\u0015 X\n\u0015 \u0014[\n\u0014\nk\nk \u0014\nk\nk\nk\n\\\n\\\n\\\nGj\nGi :\nGj =\nGj >\nai Gi :\nG:\nj=1\n\ni=1\n\nj=1\n\ni=1\n\nj=1\n\nPk\nand hence i=1 [G : Gi ]\u22121 6 1.

If [G : Gk ] is divisible by all those\n[G : G1 ], . . . , [G : Gk\u22121 ] (this happens if G is a p-group with p a prime),\nthen ([G : Gi ], [G : Gk ]) = [G : Gi ] > k.\nWe will derive some combinatorial properties of regular systems in the\nnext section, and prove Theorems 1.3-1.5 in the third section.\n2. Combinatorial Properties of Regular Systems\nRecall that a monoid is a semigroup containing an identity element.\nIn order to unify disjoint cover and minimal cover, the author [S90]\nproposed the following general notion.\nLet M be a commutative monoid (considered as an additive one) and\nS a set. A finite system {Xi }ki=1 of nonempty subsets of a set X 6= \u2205 is\ncalled an (M, S)-cover of X if there exist m1 , . . . , mk \u2208 M such that\n\u001a X\nk\n\nmi : x \u2208 X\n\ni=1\nx\u2208Xi\n\nbut\n\n\u001a X\n\ni\u2208I\nx\u2208Xi\n\nmi : x \u2208 X\n\n\u001b\n\n6\u2286 S\n\n\u001b\n\n\u2286S\n\nfor all I \u2282 [1, k].\n\n(Without any loss of generality we may let S be a subset of M .)\nThough useful in [S90], this concept involving a monoid and a set seems\ncumbersome. We can avoid it by using regular covers of a nonempty set\nby nonempty subsets. (The definition is similar to that of regular cover of\na group by cosets.)\nLet X be a nonempty set and {Xi }ki=1 a finite system of nonempty\nsubsets of X. If {Xi }ki=1 forms an (M, S)-cover of X for some commutative\n\n\f8\n\nZHI-WEI SUN\n\nmonoid M and its subset S, then it is easy to see that {Xi }ki=1 is a regular\ncover of X. Conversely, if {Xi }ki=1 is a regular cover of X then it is an\n(M0 , S0 )-cover of X, where M0 is the multiplicative monoid of positive\nintegers, and\n\u001a Y\n\u001b\nS0 =\npi : x \u2208 X\ni\u2208[1,k]\u2217 (x)\n\nwith p1 , . . . , pk distinct primes.\nTheorem 2.1.

Let G1 , . . . , Gk , H be subgroups of a group G such that\neither G1 , . . . , Gk are normal and H is maximal in G, or G1 , . . . , Gk are\nsubnormal and H is maximal normal in G. Suppose that (1.1) is a regular\nsystem for some a1 , . . . , ak \u2208 G and [G : Gi ] < \u221e for all i = 1, . . . , k. If\nfor any i, j = 1, . . . , k, either [G : Gi ] is relatively prime to [Gi : Gi \u2229 Gj ],\nor Gi and Gj are normal in G with G/(Gi \u2229 Gj ) cyclic, then we have\n{C \u2208 G/H : C \u2287 ai Gi for some i = 1, . . . , k} = \u2205 or G/H\n\n(2.5)\n\nprovided that (1.1) is a cover of G or not all the Gi are contained in H.\nProof. Let I = {1 6 i 6 k: Gi 6\u2286 H}. If I = [1, k], then the left-hand\nside of (2.5) is empty. (Note that if aH \u2287 ai Gi for some a \u2208 G then\nai H = aH \u2287 ai Gi and hence H \u2287 Gi .) When I is empty and (1.1)\nis a cover of G, the left-hand side of (2.5) coincides with G/H because\nxH \u2287 ai Gi if x \u2208 ai Gi .\nNow assume that \u2205 =\n6 I 6= [1, k] and fix a j \u2208 [1, k] \\ I. Since H \u2287 Gj ,\n[G : H] 6 [G : Gj ]T< \u221e. By Theorem 2.1(ii), the left-hand side of (2.5)\ncontains\nT at least [( i\u2208I Gi )H : H] left cosets of H. So it suffices to show\nthat ( i\u2208I Gi )H = G.\n\n\fFINITE COVERS OF GROUPS BY COSETS OR SUBGROUPS\n\n13\n\nLet i \u2208 I. As Gi 6\u2286 H, we have Gi H = HGi = G by [S01, Lemma\n2.1(ii)]. Observe that [G : H] = [Gi H : H] = [Gi : Gi \u2229 H] divides\n[Gi : Gi \u2229 Gj ] and that\n[G : Gi \u2229 H] = [G : Gi ][Gi : Gi \u2229 H] = [G : Gi ][Gi H : H] = [G : Gi ][G : H].\nIf ([G : Gi ], [Gi : Gi \u2229 Gj ]) = 1, then ([G : Gi ], [G : H]) = 1. When Gi , Gj\nare normal in G and G/(Gi \u2229 Gj ) is cyclic, we have\n[G/(Gi \u2229 Gj ) : Gi /(Gi \u2229 Gj ) \u2229 H/(Gi \u2229 Gj )]\n=[[G/(Gi \u2229 Gj ) : Gi /(Gi \u2229 Gj )], [G/(Gi \u2229 Gj ) : H/(Gi \u2229 Gj )]],\nhence [G : Gi ][G : H] = [G : Gi \u2229 H] = [[G : Gi ], [G : H]] and therefore\n([G : Gi ], [G : H]) = 1.\nT\nQ\nIn light of [S01, Lemma 3.1(ii)], [G : i\u2208I Gi ] divides i\u2208I\u0001[G : Gi ]. So\nT\nT\n([G : i\u2208I Gi ], [G : H]) = 1 by the above. Hence\ni\u2208I Gi H = G by\nLemma 2.1, and this concludes the proof. \u0003\nCorollary 2.1. Let (1.1) be a regular cover of a group G such that for any\ni, j = 1, . . . , k either Gi and Gj are normal in G with G/(Gi \u2229 Gj ) cyclic,\nor Gi and Gj are subnormal in G with ([G : Gi ], [Gi : Gi \u2229 Gj ]) = 1. If\nGj 6= G, then for some i 6= j with Gi 6= G we have ai Gi \u2229 aj Gj = \u2205.\nProof. Suppose that Gj 6= G where 1 6 j 6 k. As Gj is subnormal and of\nfinite index in G it is contained in a proper maximal normal subgroup H\nof G. Clearly aj Gj \u2286 aj H \u2282 G. Choose x \u2208 G \\ aj H. By Theorem 2.2,\nxH \u2287 ai Gi for some i \u2208 [1, k]. Since xH is disjoint from aj H, we have\nai Gi \u2229 aj Gj = \u2205. Obviously i 6= j and Gi 6= G. We are done. \u0003\n3. Proofs of Theorems 1.3-1.5\nTk\nProof of Theorem 1.3. We use induction on the finite index [G : i=1 Gi ].\nTk\nIf [G : i=1 Gi ] = 1, then G1 = * * * = Gk = G, m(A) = k and\nTk\nd(G, i=1 Gi ) = 0, so (1.9) holds trivially.\nTk\nNow let's proceed to the induction step and assume that [G : i=1 Gi ] >\n1.\nThe following observations are important in our induction step. Let K\nbe any subgroup of G. Then Gi \u2229K is subnormal in K for any i = 1, . . . , k.\nLet i, j \u2208 [1, k]. If ([G : Gi ], [Gi : Gi \u2229 Gj ]) = 1, then [K : Gi \u2229 K] is\nrelatively prime to [Gi \u2229 K : Gi \u2229 Gj \u2229 K] because [K : Gi \u2229 K] | [G : Gi ]\nand [Gi \u2229 K : (Gi \u2229 Gj ) \u2229 (Gi \u2229 K)] | [Gi : Gi \u2229 Gj ] by [S01, Lemma 3.1]. If\nboth Gi and Gj are normal in G with G/(Gi \u2229Gj ) cyclic, then both Gi \u2229K\nand Gj \u2229K are normal in K and K/(Gi \u2229Gj \u2229K) \u223c\n= (Gi \u2229Gj )K/(Gi \u2229Gj )\nis cyclic.\n\n\f14\n\nZHI-WEI SUN\n\nSuppose Gi0 6= G where 1 6 i0 6 k.

In view of Theorem 2.2, by modifying the complicated proof\nof [S90, Theorem 8], we can obtain the following result for minimal mcovers (not for regular covers): Let (1.1) be a minimal m-cover of a group\nG, and suppose that for any i, j = 1, . . . , k either Gi and Gj are subnormal\nin G with ([G : Gi ], [Gi : Gi \u2229 Gj ]) = 1, or Gi and Gj are normal in G\nwith G/(Gi \u2229 Gj ) cyclic. Then, for each subgroup K of G with I(K) =\n{1 6 i 6 k : K 6\u2286 Gi } =\n6 \u2205, we can find an r \u2208 I(K) and xi \u2208 K \\ Gi (for\ni \u2208 I(K) \\ {r}) such that\n\u0013\n\u001b\n\u001a \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\nk\nk\n\\\n\\\nGs : i \u2208 I(K) \\ {r} > d K, K \u2229\nxi K \u2229\nGs .\ns=1\n\ns=1\n\nTk\nIf K \u2287 Gj for some j \u2208 [1, k], or K \u2287 H = ( s=1 Gs )G and K/H is a\nHall subgroup of G/H, then I(K) = {1 6 i 6 k : [G : Gi ] \u2224 [G : K]} by\nLemma 3.1 given later.\n\n\f16\n\nZHI-WEI SUN\n\nProof of Theorem 1.4. Let M be any perfect normal subgroup of G. Fix\nx \u2208 G and set Mx = hM, xi = hxiM . Since Mx /M \u223c\n= hxi/(hxi \u2229 M ) is\ncyclic and hence abelian, Mx\u2032 \u2286 M = M \u2032 \u2286 Mx\u2032 and therefore Mx\u2032 = M .\nAs {Gi }ki=1 is an m-cover of G, we can choose a minimal Ix \u2286 [1, k]\nsuch that |Ix\u2217 (g)| > m for all g \u2208 Mx . Clearly Ax = {Gi \u2229 Mx }i\u2208Ix forms\na minimal m-cover of Mx by subnormal subgroups of Mx . We claim that\nJ = {i \u2208 Ix : Gi 6\u2287 Mx } is empty. Assume on the contrary that J 6= \u2205.\nThen |{i \u2208 Ix : Gi \u2287 Mx }| < m. Since {Gi \u2229 Mx }i\u2208J is a cover of Mx\nby proper subnormal subgroups, Mx possesses a cover by proper normal\nsubgroups. Applying a result of Brodie, Chamberlain and Kappe [BCK],\nwe find that Mx has a normal subgroup H such that Mx /H \u223c\n= Cp \u00d7 Cp\n\u2032\nfor some prime p. As Mx /H is abelian, we have M = Mx \u2286 H and hence\nMx /H \u223c\n= (Mx /M )/(H/M ) is cyclic. This contradiction shows that our\nclaim is true.\nS\nLet I = x\u2208G Ix . For each x \u2208 G, clearly |I \u2217 (x)| > |Ix\u2217 (x)| > m. Since\n{Gi }ki=1 is a minimal m-cover of G, we must have I = [1, k]. For any\ni \u2208 [1, k], there is an x \u2208 G such that i \u2208 Ix and hence Gi \u2287 Mx \u2287 M .\nTk\nBy the above, F = i=1 Gi contains any perfect normal subgroup of\nTk\nG. As {Gi /FG }ki=1 is a minimal m-cover of G/FG , F/FG = i=1 Gi /FG\ncontains any perfect normal subgroup of the finite group G/FG . In light of\nparts (i)and (v) of Theorem 3.1 of [S01], there exists a composition series\nfrom F/FG to G/FG whose factors are of prime orders. Thus there is also\na composition series from F to G whose factors are of prime orders, and\nhence F contains all perfect subgroups of G by [S01, Theorem 3.1]. This\nconcludes our proof. \u0003\nLemma 3.1. Let H and K be subgroups of a group G with finite index.\nSuppose that H or K is subnormal in G, and ([G : K], [K : H \u2229 K]) = 1.\nThen\n[G : H \u2229 K] = [[G : H], [G : K]];\n(3.1)\nhence\nH \u2287 K \u21d0\u21d2 [G : H] | [G : K],\n\nand\n\nK \u2287 H \u21d0\u21d2 [G : K] | [G : H].\n\nProof. As [G : K] is relatively prime to [K : H \u2229 K],\n[G : H \u2229 K] = [G : K][K : H \u2229 K] = [[G : K], [K : H \u2229 K]].\nBy [S01, Lemma 3.1(i)], [K : H \u2229 K] | [G : H] and therefore [G : H \u2229 K] |\n[[G : H], [G : K]]. On the other hand, [G : H \u2229 K] is obviously divisible\nby both [G : H] and [G : K]. So we have (3.1).\nObserve that\nH \u2287 K \u21d0\u21d2 [G : H \u2229 K]/[G : K] = [K : H \u2229 K] = 1\n\u21d0\u21d2 [[G : H], [G : K]] = [G : K] (i.e., [G : H] | [G : K]).\n\n\fFINITE COVERS OF GROUPS BY COSETS OR SUBGROUPS\n\n17\n\nSimilarly, K \u2287 H if and only if [G : K] | [G : H]. This ends the proof. \u0003\nT\nProof of Theorem 1.5. For any \u2205 =\n6 J \u2286 [1, k], we assert that [G : j\u2208J Gj ]\nis the least common multiple [nj ]j\u2208J of those nj = [G : G\nTj ] with j \u2208 J.\nWhen |J| = 1, this is trivial. Now assume |J| > 1 and [G : j\u2208J\\{j0 } Gj ] =\nT\n[nj ]j\u2208J\\{j0 } , where j0 = max J. Observe that [Gj0 : Gj0 \u2229 j\u2208J\\{j0 } Gj ]\ndivides [Gj0 : H] and hence it is relatively prime to [G : Gj0 ].
