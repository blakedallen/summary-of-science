Introduction\nBy leveraging the capabilities of photonics (speed) and of electronics (compactness), it should be\npossible to realize high performance integrated opto-plasmonic systems with applications from\nhigh bandwidth communications to sensing, and beyond.\n\nSuch integration requires the\n\navailability of ultra-compact, ultra-fast, reconfigurable and tunable photonic components.\nIn this work, we propose and design one of such reconfigurable electromagnetic (EM)\ncomponents with variable focus such that its output field profile can be tuned from an\nunfocussed beam to a highly localized beam with extended focal region that can be moved from\ninfinity towards the lens surface by changing the intensity of the incident beam. Two\nconfigurations of such device will be discussed: i) self-focusing beam and ii) all-optically\nexternally controlled focusing. The proposed device is designed using transformation optics [1,2]\nand in particular, based on concentrator reported by Rahm et al. [3] and Wang et al. [4].\n2. Nonlinear lens theory and modeling\nIn cylindrical coordinate system, the space of a concentrator is divided into two regions; the core\nand the shell. The shell of the concentrator channels the incident field into the core where it is\nconcentrated. The transformation needed to 'squeeze' light into the core in parameters can be\ndescribed by [3, 4]:\n\n\uf8f1R1 r / R2\nr' = \uf8f2\n\uf8f3( R3 \u2212 R1 ) r /( R3 \u2212 R2 ) \u2212 ( R2 \u2212 R1 ) R3 /( R3 \u2212 R2 )\n\n0 \u2264 r < R1\n1\n\n\u2264 r \u2264 R3\n\nThis transformation is mapped to material tensors as follows [3, 4]:\n\n(1)\n\n\f\u03b5r\n\nwhere\n\ni, j\n\n= \u03bcr\n\ni, j\n\n\uf8f1\uf8ee1 0\n0\n\uf8f9\n\uf8f4\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n0\n\uf8f4\uf8ef0 1\n\uf8fa\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f0\uf8ef0 0 (R2 / R1 ) 2 \uf8fb\uf8fa\n=\uf8f2\n0\n0\n\uf8f9\n\uf8f4\uf8ee(r + M ) / r\n\uf8fa\n\uf8f4\uf8ef\n0\nr /(r + M )\n0\n\uf8fa\n\uf8f4\uf8ef\n0\n0\nN (r + M ) / r\uf8fa\uf8fb\n\uf8f3\uf8f4\uf8ef\uf8f0\n\n0 \u2264 r \u2264 R1\n(2)\nR1 < r \u2264 R3\n\nM = ( R2 \u2212 R1 ) R3 /( R3 \u2212 R 2 ), N = [( R3 \u2212 R 2 ) /( R3 \u2212 R1 )] 2\n\nFinite element method is used to simulate the working of the designed tunable lens. The\nschematic of the proposed device designed to function at a wavelength of 1.5 \u03bc m is as shown in\nFig. 1a. Dimensions of the structure are such that R1 = 2\u03bcm, R2= 4\u03bcm and R3= 6\u03bc m.\nComputation domain is terminated by perfectly matched layers (PMLs) to absorb the scattered\nfield. Structure is illuminated by a TE polarized plane wave incident from left having a\nwavelength of 1.5 \u03bc m. Graded refractive index of the shell region squeezes this light towards the\ncore.\nWhen the applied incident field is low, the device acts in a linear regime and behaves like the\nconcentrator as was demonstrated in [3, 4] and concentrates the EM field inside the core region.\nThe surface plot of power flow for this case is as shown in Fig. 1b.\nTunable lens proposed here utilizes a nonlinear core element. We use Kerr-type nonlinear\nmedium having a cubic nonlinearity defined by \u03c7\n\n(3)\n\n. Nonlinear phenomena change the optical\n\nproperties of the core as the refractive index of the core dependent on the intensity of the incident\nelectric field. On increasing the intensity of the incident field, the refractive index of the core\nincreases. Electromagnetic radiation is slowed down inside the core and the part of the wave that\ntravels the farthest is delayed the most, which results in a net curvature and hence focusing of the\nfield. The device operates as a lens and focusses field such that the intensity is confined to a\n\n\flocalized narrow spot. The location of that focal spot moves from infinity (linear case) towards\nthe lens as shown in Fig. 2 (a)-(c). Upon further increasing the applied field, the refractive index\nof the core becomes sufficiently high such that the device becomes a reflector/scatter and reflects\naway all the EM radiation.\n3. Conclusion\n\nWe demonstrate a tunable structure that can be switched from the functionality of a concentrator\nto that of a lens and to a scatter/reflector depending on the intensity of the incident light. This\ndevice may find applications for the development of ultra-compact reconfigurable optical\ncomponents for all optical circuits.\n\nThis research was supported by the US Army Research Office Award # W911NF-09-1-0075.\n\n4.
