The two main advantages of ESM are: (1) They can describe in an analytical\nor exact numerical way a wide variety of elementary phenomena. (2) They can be and have been used as a testing\nground for various many-body approaches. The simplest\nexample of ESM is the rank-one su(2) model of fermions\nin one orbit or in several degenerate orbits with a constant pairing interaction, often used to introduce nuclear\nsuperconductivity (see e.g., Ref. [1]).\nIn general, a quantum system has a dynamical symmetry if the Hamiltonian can be expressed in terms of the\nCasimir operators of a chain of nested algebras. A typical\nexample of a model with rank-two Lie algebra dynamical\nsymmetry is Elliott's su(3) model, introduced to describe\nthe phenomenon of nuclear deformation [2]. Elliott's\nHamiltonian is a linear combination of the quadratic\nCasimir operator of the su(3) Lie algebra (involving a\nquadrupole-quadrupole interaction) and of the Casimir\nof its so(3) subalgebra, associated with angular momentum. Lie algebras with higher rank lead to more complex\nESM like the so(5) model of T = 1, isovector pairing [3],\nthe so(8) model of T = 0, 1 isoscalar and isovector pairing [4, 5], Ginocchio's model with so(8) and sp(6) structure [6], also known as the Fermion Dynamical Symmetry\nModel (FDSM) [7]. The three dynamical symmetries of\nthe Interacting Boson Model (IBM) [8] provide another\nexample of this approach.\nThe concept of quantum integrability goes beyond the\nlimits of the dynamical symmetry approach. A quantum\nsystem is integrable if there exist as many commuting\nHermitian operators (integrals of motion) as quantum\ndegrees of freedom [9]. The set of Casimir operators of a\nchain of nested algebras fulfills this condition. There are,\nhowever, also well-known examples of integrable models\nwithout dynamical symmetry [10].\nUsually dynamical symmetry models are defined for\ndegenerate single-particle levels. Changes in the single-\n\n\u2217 On leave of absence from the Institute of Nuclear Research and\nNuclear Energy, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences.\n\nparticle energies break the dynamical symmetry but may\nstill preserve integrability. The pairing model with nondegenerate single-particle levels, with an exact solution\nfound by Richardson in the sixties, represents a unique\nexample of an ESM with such characteristics [11]. Recently, Richardson's model has been shown to be integrable by finding the complete set of integrals of motion constructed in terms of the generators of the su(2)\nalgebra [12]. Subsequently, more general exactly solvable pairing models, both for fermions and for bosons,\ncalled the Richardson-Gaudin (RG) models, have been\nproposed [13]. Since then, a great deal of work has been\ndevoted to understand the properties of these ESM and\nto apply them to a wide variety of problems in nuclear,\ncondensed-matter, atomic, and molecular physics [14].\nThe aim of this Letter is to present the generalization\nof the RG models to those symmetry algebras that have\ngiven rise to the well-known ESM in nuclear physics. In\nmost cases this generalization will allow non-degenerate\nsingle-particle energies, as well as other symmetry breaking one-body operators. As an example, we shall discuss the exact solution of the so(5) proton-neutron (pn)\nisovector pairing model with non-degenerate orbits, for\nwhich an exact solution has been proposed by Richardson [15]. However, it has been recently shown that the\nRichardson's solution was incorrect [16].\nWe also mention that so(5) has been proposed as\nthe symmetry underlying high Tc -superconductivity [17].\nThe exactly solvable RG models discussed in this Letter could be used to generalize so(5) condensed-matter\nmodels [18] by the explicit addition of non-degenerate\nsingle-particle symmetry-breaking terms.\nWe begin by introducing a set of commuting operators,\nthe RG operators (integrals of motion) Ri [19]:\nRi =\n\nX Xi * Xj\n+ \u03bei ,\nzj \u2212 zi\n\n(1)\n\nj(6=i)\n\nwhere the index i (j) refers to the i-th (j-th) copy of a\nLie algebra L with generators Xi\u03b1 , zi are fixed parameters\nwhich later will be related to the single-particle energies,\nand \u03be is a generic element of the Cartan subalgebra of L\n(see below). The scalar product is defined through the\nL-invariant metric tensor g\u03b1\u03b2 = c\u03c3\u03b1\u03c1 c\u03c1\u03b2\u03c3 where c\u03b3\u03b1\u03b2 are\n\n\f2\nthe structure constants of L, e.g., Xi * Xj \u2261 Xi\u03b1 g\u03b1\u03b2 Xj\u03b2 .\nSince the Ri commute, any function of these operators\ncan be used as a model Hamiltonian for an integrable\nsystem. In particular, any linear combination of the Ri\nis integrable and is at most quadratic in the generators.\nFor any simple algebra L, the eigenvalues of the Ri\nhave been given in Ref. [19] or can be derived from the\nGaudin-algebra approach [20]:\na\n\nr X\nM\nX \u039bi * \u039bj X\n\u039bi * \u03c0 a\n+\n,\nri = \u039bi * \u03be +\nzj \u2212 zi a=1 \u03b1=1 zi \u2212 ea,\u03b1\n\n(2)\n\nj(6=i)\n\nwhere the parameters ea,\u03b1 are solutions of the generalized\nRichardson equations [19, 20]\nb\n\nr X\nM\nX\n\nb=1 \u03b2=1\n\n\u2032\n\nL\n\nX \u039bi * \u03c0 a\n\u03c0b * \u03c0a\n\u2212\n= \u03be * \u03c0 a \u2261 \u03c1a . (3)\neb,\u03b2 \u2212 ea,\u03b1 i=1 zi \u2212 ea,\u03b1\n\nThe primed sum means that the singular term (a, \u03b1) =\n(b, \u03b2) is omitted and L is the number of copies of the\nalgebra L of rank r. The Cartan subalgebra LC \u2282 L\nhas the elements h1, . . . , hr and the \u03c1a are the components of \u03be in this generally non-orthonormal basis. The\n\u03c0sa are the components of the r simple roots \u03c01, . . . , \u03c0 r\nof L in the Cartan-Weyl basis, [hs , E a ] = \u03c0sa E a . Each\n\u039bi is a vector of highest weight (usually of the fundamental representation) for the i-th copy of L and\na\nthe expression\nP a s\u039bi * \u03c0 corresponds to the eigenvalue of\na\nH =\ns \u03c0s h in this highest-weight state of the i-th\ncopy of L. The \u03c1a are, in a sense, the strength components of the symmetry-breaking one-body operator \u03be.\nFinally, the M a are positive numbers related to the eigenvalues ma of H aPin the eigenstate of the integrals of motion (1), M a = i (\u039bi * \u03c0 a \u2212 mai ).\nEquations (2) and (3) were derived by Asorey et al. [19]\nunder the assumption that L is the Lie algebra of a simple, simply-connected, compact Lie group. We arrived at\nthe same equations within Ushveridize's framework [20]\nwhich assumes that L is a singular semi-simple Lie algebra (i.e., a classical algebra or one of the exceptional\nalgebras E6 or E7 ). Since Eqs. (2) and (3) involve a\ndot product, well defined for any Lie algebra, one may\nexpect that the equations themselves are valid for any\nsemi-simple Lie algebra and possibly for an even larger\nclass. In fact, it is desirable to find a formulation of these\nequations that involves arbitrarily chosen Cartan algebra\ngenerators instead of the simple roots of the algebra.\nAlthough one can use any function of the Ri as a\nHamiltonian, the following particular linear combination\nyields a simple expression for the eigenvalues:\n!\nX\nX\nX (i)\n1\nzi \u03bei \u2212\nzi Ri =\nH=\n.\n(4)\nC2\nC2 \u2212\n2\ni\ni\ni\nWith the same linear combination of the eigenvalues\nri (2) and using the Richardson equations (3), one can\nshow that the eigenvalues of (4) are linear in the spectral\n\nparameters ea,\u03b1 with coefficients \u03b4 a that depend on the\nsymmetry-breaking strengths \u03c1a .\nThe Hamiltonian (4) shows how the global Lsymmetry represented by the total second-order Casimir\noperator C2 is broken by the first term containing the\nelements \u03bei of the Cartan subalgebras LC\ni . In the general\ncase of zi 6= zj the first term does not commute with C2 .\nThus, the eigenstates of (4) are spread over different irreducible representations of L and they are not eigenstates\nof the total Casimir operator C2 .\nUsing Cartan's classification of semi-simple Lie algebras, one can now generalize many nuclear physics models within this framework (see Table I). Note that models\nTABLE I: Algebras associated with some nuclear physics\nmodels; \u223c denotes isomorphisms.

In contrast, models based on\nrealizations of the form a\u2020\u03b1 a\u03b2 , such as su(n), contain differences of number operators.\nTo illustrate the present formalism, we shall discuss\nthe example of T = 1 pairing in systems with protons\nand neutrons and non-degenerate single-particle levels.\nThe dynamical symmetry limit of pn-pairing in a single\ndegenerate shell was first considered by Flowers [3] as an\nimportant extension of the original pairing problem between identical particles. It yields a seniority classification of protons and neutrons in jj coupling in terms of pp,\nnn, and pn pairs. In doing so, the concepts of seniority v\n(the number of nucleons not in pairs coupled to angular\nmomentum zero) and of reduced isospin t (the isospin of\nthese nucleons) are established. The application of this\nso(5) formalism has given rise to many analytic reduction\nformulae for shell-model matrix elements [22].\nFor simplicity, in the RG extension of the so(5) dynamical symmetry model we will restrict ourselves to seniority v = 0 (and consequently reduced isospin t = 0),\nthough states with broken nucleon pairs can be easily incorporated in the formalism. We begin by specifying the\nCartan generators of so(5):\n1 \u2020\n1\n(p pi + p\u2020\u0131\u0304 p\u0131\u0304 ) \u2212 (n\u2020i ni + n\u2020\u0131\u0304 n\u0131\u0304 ),\n2 i\n2\n1 X \u2020\n=\n(\u03c1 \u03c1i + \u03c1\u2020\u0131\u0304 \u03c1\u0131\u0304 ) \u2212 1,\n2 \u03c1=p,n i\n\nh1,i =\nh2,i\n\n\f3\nwhere \u03c1 labels protons (p) or neutrons (n), i is the i-th\ncopy of so(5) and \u0131\u0304 is the time reversal of the state i. We\nidentify h1 with the third component of the isospin and\nh2 with the nucleon number.\nThe positive-root vectors are the T = \u221a\n1 creation opera\u2020\n\u2020 \u2020 \u2020\n\u2020 \u2020\n\u2020 \u2020\ntors {b\u22121,i \u2261 ni n\u0131\u0304 , b0,i \u2261 (ni p\u0131\u0304 + pi n\u0131\u0304 )/ 2, b\u2020+1,i \u2261 p\u2020i p\u2020\u0131\u0304 }\n\u221a\nplus the isospin-raising operator T+,i \u2261 (p\u2020i ni +p\u2020\u0131\u0304 n\u0131\u0304 )/ 2.\nThe simple-root vectors are {b\u2020\u22121,i , T+,i } and b\u2020\u22121,i is the\nsingular-root vector [20]. These, together with the conjugate operators, close the so(5) algebra. The isospin subalgebra suT (2) \u2282 so(5) is generated by the so(5) elements\nthat are not related to b\u2020\u22121,i . That is, suT (2) is generated\nby T+,i , T\u2212,i = (T+,i )\u2020 , and [T+,i , T\u2212,i ] = T0,i = h1,i .\nSince so(5) is a rank-two algebra, there are two types of\nspectral parameters: e1,\u03b1 and e2,\u03b2 which shall be denoted\nas w\u03b1 and e\u03b2 . The upper bounds M 1 and M 2 for the\nindices \u03b1 and \u03b2, respectively, are related to the isospin\nT and the total number of pairs N via the expressions\nM 1 = N \u2212 T and M 2 = N . The scalar products of the\nsimple roots are \u03c02*\u03c02 = 2, \u03c01*\u03c01 = 1, and \u03c02*\u03c01 = \u22121.\nIn the spherical shell model protons and neutrons occupy\nsingle-particle states with quantum numbers (j, m). The\nindex i then corresponds to jm and \u0131\u0304 to j m\u0304. Alternatively, due to the rotational symmetry, the angular momentum j can be used as a label instead of i but then\nthe corresponding degeneracy \u03a9j = (2j + 1)/2 should be\ntaken into account. Finally, the weights \u039bi are the same\nfor all i and are those of the fundamental representation\nof so(5), that is, \u039b *\u03c01 = 0 and \u039b *\u03c02 = 1. Inserting these\nin Eq. (3), together with the choice \u03c11 = 0, \u03c12 = \u22121/g,\nand zi = 2\u03b5i , we obtain the generalized Richardson equations for the T = 1 pn-pairing:\nN\nN\n\u2212T\nX\nX\nX\n1\n2\n1\n\u03a9j\n+\n+\n,\n=\ng\n2\u03b5\n\u2212\ne\ne\n\u2212\ne\nw\n\u2212\ne\u03b1\nj\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\n\u03b3\n\u03b3=1\nj=1\n\u03b2(6=\u03b1)\n\nN\nX\n\nN\n\u2212T\nX\n1\n1\n0 =\n+\n.\ne\n\u2212\nw\nw\n\u2212\nw\u03b4\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\n\u03b1=1 \u03b1\n\n(5)\n\n\u03b4(6=\u03b3)\n\nThe particular case of \u03a9j = 1 was derived by Links et\nal. [23] using the algebraic Bethe ansatz. Each solution\nof the equations (5) gives an eigenstate of the pn-pairing\nHamiltonian\nX \u2020\nX\nb\u03bc,jm b\u03bc,jm ,\n(6)\n2\u03b5j (h2,jm + 1) \u2212 g\nHpn =\njm\n\n\u03bc,jm\n\nPN\nwith eigenvalues E = \u03b1=1 e\u03b1 . The spectral parameters\ne are interpreted as pair energies as in the case of su(2)\npairing. However, due to the larger rank of the so(5), a\nnew set of spectral parameters w\u03b4 appears in the equations (5). These new parameters w are associated with\nthe su(2)T isospin subalgebra. For each possible isospin\nT there are N \u2212 T new w-parameters. The meaning of\nthis new set of parameters w, which do not appear in the\nexpression for the eigenvalues, becomes evident when analyzing the eigenstates of (6). The Bethe ansatz for the\n\nso(5) eigenstates of the RG model isP\na factorized product\nwave function. It consists, for N < j \u03a9j , of a neutronpair product state related to the lowest-weight state of\nsuT (2) and a isospin-raising product operator state that\nguaranties the required total isospin of the ansatz:\n|w, e; \u03b5i =\n\nNY\n\u2212T\n\nT+ (w\u03b3 )\n\n\u03b3=1\n\nN\nY\n\n\u03b1=1\n\nb+\n\u22121 (e\u03b1 ) |oi ,\n\nwhere the spectral dependence of the generators is given\nby the expressions\nT+ (w\u03b3 ) =\n\nX\ni\n\nT+,i\n,\n2\u03b5i \u2212 w\u03b3\n\nb\u00b1\n\u03bc (e\u03b1 ) =\n\nX\ni\n\nb\u00b1\n\u03bc,i\n2\u03b5i \u2212 e\u03b1\n\nNote that application of T+ on b\u2020\u22121 results in b\u20200 , and application of T+ on b\u20200 results in b\u2020+1 which provides us with\nUshveridize's linear combination of powers of b\u2020\u03bc [20].\nFurther insight into the structure of the equations (5)\ncan be gained by using the classical electrostatic analogy [24]. They can be considered as the equilibrium\ncondition for a 2D classical electrostatic problem involving three sets of charged particles: (a) the orbitons with\ncharges \u2212\u03a9j /2 and fixed positions 2\u03b5j ; (b) the pairons\nwith unit positive charges and free positions e\u03b1 ; and (c)\nthe new w particles with unit positive charges and free\npositions w\u03b4 . In addition, there is a uniform electric\nfield in the vertical direction (the real axes) with strength\n\u223c 1/g. Furthermore, the w particles do not interact with\nthe orbitons and do not feel the electric field, which can\nbee seen from the second equation in (5).\nAs an example, we performed numerical calculations\nfor 64 Ge (4 protons and 4 neutrons) using the singleparticle energies (in MeV) \u01eb3/2 = 0.00, \u01eb5/2 = 0.77,\n\u01eb1/2 = 1.11, and \u01eb9/2 = 3.00 and two pn-pairing\nstrengths, g = 0.1 (weak) and 0.37 (strong). We first\nchecked, in this non-trivial case, that the solutions of (5)\nare indeed the exact solution of the Hamiltonian (6) by\ndirect comparison with a standard nuclear shell-model\ncalculation.\nFigure 1 shows the solutions for the lowest T = 0,\n1, and 2 states. The T = 0 solution corresponds to\nthe ground state, while the T = 1 and T = 2 solutions are excited states in 64 Ge. As in the su(2) pairing\ncase, the different configurations can be classified in the\nweak-coupling limit. As can be seen from Fig. 1, at weak\ncoupling four pairs occupy the p3/2 (the four pairons are\nclose to the p3/2 ) in the T=0 state. This configuration is\nnot allowed for T = 1 and T = 2 states due to the Pauli\nprinciple. Correspondingly, three pairons are close to the\nlowest p3/2 orbiton and the fourth pairon approaches the\norbiton f5/2 . In all cases the w particles are intertwined\nwith the pairons to minimize the Coulomb interaction.\nThe number of w particles (N \u2212 T ), together with the\ninitial configuration at weak coupling, defines each eigenstate of the pn-pairing Hamiltonian. As g increases, the\nfree charges expand under the influence of the electric\n\n\f4\n2\n\n0.4\n\nT=0\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0.0\n\n-1\n\n-0.2\n\n-2\n\n-0.4\n\n-3\n\n-0.6\n\n2\n\n1.5\n\nT=1\n\nT=1\n\n1.0\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\nReal\n\nReal\n\nT=0\n\n1\n\n0.0\n-0.5\n-1.0\n\n0\n-1\n-2\n2\n\n2.0\n\nT=2\n\n1.5\n\nT=2\n\n1\n\n1.0\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n-1\n\n0.0\n\n-2\n\n-0.5\n-3\n-0.6\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.2\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\nImaginary\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n-2.0\n\n-1.5\n\n-1.0\n\n-0.5\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\nImaginary\n\nFIG. 1: Two-dimensional representation of the e pairon and\nw particle positions in 64 Ge for the lowest-energy states with\nisospin T = 0, T = 1, and T = 2.

The T = 1 case shows an exchange of\npositions in the real axis of a pairon and a w particle as\nan example of the second class of singularities. The first\nclass of singularities were already present in the su(2)\npairing case and they precluded the practical use of the\nexact solution for a long time. Recently, a new method to\novercome this numerical problem was proposed [25]. We\nbelieve that the same procedure can be used to treat the\nsecond class of singularities as well, making feasible the\nexact solution of the so(5) model for very large systems.\nIn summary, we have presented the generalization of\nRG models to arbitrary semi-simple Lie algebras, which\ninclude most of the dynamical-symmetry models of nuclear physics. The generalized RG models allow the introduction of one-body symmetry breaking terms like nondegenerate single-particle energies. As an example of this\napproach, we gave the exact solution of the so(5) pnpairing model. We emphasize that the exact solution for\nlarge systems with so(5) symmetry could be of great importance in condensed-matter physics in addressing the\nphenomenon of high Tc -superconductivity [17, 18]. Finally, the treatment of higher-rank algebras like sp(6)\nand so(8) opens the possibility of exact nuclear structure calculations with more realistic quantum integrable\nmodels.\nThis work was supported in part by the Spanish DGI\nunder grant No. BFM2003-05316-C02-02 and by the\nCICYT-IN2P3 cooperation.
