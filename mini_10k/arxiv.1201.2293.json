The disc's radiative properties play an important role in the evolution of discs in binaries. A radiative disc has an overall\nshape and internal structure that are significantly different compared to a locally isothermal disc with same temperature profile. This\nis an important finding both for describing the evolutionary track of the disc during its progressive mass loss, and for planet formation\nsince the internal structure of the disc is relevant for planetesimals growth in binary systems. The non-symmetrical distribution of\nmass in these discs causes large eccentricities for planetesimals that may affect their growth.\nKey words. Protoplanetary disks - Methods: numerical - Planets and satellites: formation\n\n1. Introduction\nProtoplanetary discs are known to exist in pre-main-sequence\nbinary star systems through direct imaging (Koerner et al.\n1993; Stapelfeldt et al. 1998; Rodr\u0131\u0301guez et al. 1998) and spectral energy distributions (Ghez et al. 1993; Prato et al. 2003;\nMonin et al. 2007). Petr-Gotzens et al. (2010) have recently\nclaimed that as much as 80% of all binary star systems in\nthe \u223c 1 Myr old Orion Nebula Cluster might have an active accretion disc. Trilling et al. (2007) showed that the incidence of debris discs in binary systems is not that different\nthan that for single stars. These observations seem to suggest\nthat the ground for planet formation in binary star systems is\npresent even if, at subsequent stages, the gravitational perturbations by the companion star may negatively impact the growth\nprocess. Bonavita & Desidera (2007); Mugrauer & Neuh\u00e4user\n(2009) have shown that the frequency of planets in binaries is\nnot very different from that around single stars. However, this\nfrequency critically depends on the binary separation and close\nbinaries appear to be less favorable environments for planet formation. Only a few planets are presently known in tight systems\n(GI86, HD41004 and \u03b3 Cephei) and it is expected that when the\nbinary separation is in the range 20-100 AU the gravitational\ninfluence of the companion star must have influenced the planet\nformation process, affecting either the disc evolution or the planetesimal accumulation process (Desidera & Barbieri 2007).\n\nOf particular importance are the initial stages of planetesimal evolution when the mutual impact velocities must remain\nlow to allow mass growth despite the perturbations by the\ncompanion star. Previous studies (e.g., Marzari & Scholl 2000;\nTh\u00e9bault et al. 2006, 2008, 2009; Paardekooper et al. 2008;\nXie & Zhou 2009; Paardekooper & Leinhardt 2010) have shown\nthat the combination of gas drag force and secular perturbations\nby the secondary star has strong effects on planetesimal orbits,\nleading to pericenter alignment and to an equilibrium distribution for the eccentricity of small planetesimals. Since the magnitude of the gas drag force depends on the planetesimals size, the\nvariation of eccentricity and pericenter longitude with particle\nsize may well inhibit the formation of larger bodies by exciting\nlarge mutual impact velocities.\nOne question that needs to be addressed is to what extent\nthe disc's perturbation due to the companion star (e.g., Lubow\n1991a,b; Kley et al. 2008) affects the distributions of eccentricity and longitude of pericenter for planetesimals of different size.\nModels in which the planetesimals orbital evolution was computed along with the time evolution of the disc (Kley & Nelson\n2008; Paardekooper et al. 2008) have shown that the disc eccentricity may strongly influence the dynamics of small planetesimals by introducing radial gas drag forces and non-axisymmetric\ncomponents in the gravity field of the disc. This additional perturbing force may act either in favor or against planetesimal accretion by affecting the relative impact velocities between the\n1\n\n\fF. Marzari et al.: Radiative discs in close binaries\n\nbodies. An in depth analysis is needed to explore the strength\nof these perturbations. This first requires investigating the impact of the companion star on the disc's eccentricity. We focus on relatively close binary star systems with large mass\nratios and potentially large eccentricities which, according to\nDuquennoy & Mayor (1991), populate the peak of the frequency\ndistribution in our neighborhood. Modelling the response of a\nprotoplanetary disc to the gravitational perturbations by a secondary (companion) star requires by necessity a numerical approach, since it is difficult to predict analytically the disc shape\nand evolution with time.\nIn a previous paper (Marzari et al. (2009), hereafter Paper I)\nwe used the numerical code FARGO to model the time evolution\nof a two-dimensional (2D) circumstellar disc in close binary star\nsystems, including the effects of disc self-gravity. We focused on\nmassive discs, with an initial mass equal to 0.04M\u2299, as well as a\nlarge binary's mass ratio (\u03bc = M s /M p = 0.4). This value is statistically the most frequent among the binary systems observed\nso far (Duquennoy & Mayor 1991). We found that self-gravity\nsignificantly affects the increase in the disc eccentricity induced\nby the companion perturbations, and also influences the orientation of the disc relative to the binary reference frame by causing\nlibration instead of circulation. We also sampled different values\nof the binary's eccentricity, eb , ranging from 0 to 0.6. The main\nfindings of paper I were the following:\n\u2013 self-gravity plays a significant role in shaping the disc. The\ndynamical eccentricity ed (defined in Sect. 2.3) of the disc\ntypically ranges from \u223c 0.05 to \u223c 0.15, depending on the\nbinary eccentricity, eb . It is smaller than in models without\nself gravity,\n\u2013 ed is inversely proportional to eb , with the case of a circular\nbinary (eb = 0) being the most perturbing configuration,\n\u2013 the disc orientation \u03c9d (defined in Sect. 2.3) librates around\n\u03c0, while it was circulating in the absence of self gravity,\n\u2013 an eccentric low-density region develops in the inner disc\nparts because of the large eccentricity and aligned pericenters of the gas streamlines there.\nThe results of paper I have been obtained assuming a locally\nisothermal equation of state for the gas, wherein the initial radial profile of the temperature remains constant in time, its value\nbeing set by the choice for the disc aspect ratio h = H/r, with\nH the pressure scale height. This approximation is well suited\nin disc regions where radiation cooling is efficient and the gas\nis optically thin. However, in particular in the initial stages of\ntheir evolution, discs may be optically thick and a more detailed\ntreatment of the energy balance is required. In addition, when it\npasses at its pericenter, the secondary star triggers spiral shocks\nthat may generate local strong shock and compressional heating, which may violate the local isothermal approximation. The\npropagation of these shock waves may also be significantly altered in radiative discs. In this paper, we focus on how the disc\neccentricity and orientation depend on the disc radiative properties. Our approach is the following. We first examine how our\nprevious results on locally isothermal discs depend on the choice\nfor the (fixed) temperature profile of the disc. We then consider\ndisc models with a radiative energy equation, for which we find\nthat the averaged disc's eccentricity in its inner parts is smaller\ncompared to locally isothermal disc models with similar temperature profile. We finally discuss the impact of our results in terms\nof planetesimals dynamics.\n2\n\n2. Model description\n2.1. Code\n\nTwo-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations were carried out\nwith the ADSG version1 of the code FARGO. The code solves\nthe hydrodynamical equations on a polar grid, and it uses an\nupwind transport scheme along with a harmonic, second-order\nslope limiter (van Leer 1977). The ADSG version of the FARGO\ncode includes an adiabatic energy equation and a self-gravity\nmodule based on fast Fourier transforms (Baruteau & Masset\n2008). Heating and cooling source terms have been implemented\nin the energy equation as described in Sect. 2.2. The specificity\nof the FARGO algorithm is to use a change of rotating frame on\neach ring of the grid, which increases the timestep significantly.\nResults of simulations are expressed in the following code\nunits: the mass unit is the mass of the primary star, M p , which\nis taken equal to 1M\u2299 . The length unit is set to 1 AU, and the\norbital period at 1 AU is 2\u03c0 times the code's time unit.\n2.2. Physical model and numerical setup\n\nWe adopt a 2D disc model in which self-gravity and an energy\nequation are included (unless otherwise stated). The hydrodynamical equations are solved in a cylindrical coordinate system\n{r, \u03c6} centered onto the primary star, with r \u2208 [0.5 AU \u2212 15 AU]\nand \u03c6 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0]. The grid used in our calculations has Nr = 256\nradial zones and Ns = 512 azimuthal zones, and a logarithmic\nspacing is used along the radial direction. The frame rotates\nwith the Keplerian angular velocity at the binary's semi-major\naxis, and the indirect terms accounting for the acceleration of\nthe primary due to the gravity of the secondary and of the disc\nare included.\nBinary parameters- Throughout this study, we adopt as\nstandard model a binary system where the secondary star has a\nmass Ms = 0.4M\u2299 . The binary is held on a fixed eccentric orbit\nwith semi-major axis ab = 30 AU and eccentricity eb = 0.4,\ncorresponding to an orbital period \u2248 134 yr.\nEnergy equation- Since the purpose of this work is to examine\nthe impact of an energy equation on the disc's response to the\nperiodic passages of a close companion, we carried simulations\nincluding either an energy equation, or a locally isothermal equation such that the initial temperature profile remains constant in\ntime. In all cases, the disc verifies the ideal gas law,\np = R\u03a3T/\u03bc,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere p and T denote the vertically-integrated pressure and temperature, respectively, \u03a3 is the mass surface density, R is the ideal\ngas constant, and \u03bc is the mean molecular weight, taken equal to\n2.35. When included, the energy equation takes the form:\n\u2202e\n+ \u2207 * (ev) = \u2212p\u2207 * v + Q+visc \u2212 Q\u2212cool + \u03bbe\u22072 log(p/\u03a3\u03b3 )\n\u2202t\n\n(2)\n\nwhere e = p/(\u03b3 \u2212 1) is the thermal energy density, \u03b3 is the adiabatic index, and v denotes the gas velocity. We take \u03b3 = 1.4\nthroughout this study. In Eq. (2), Q+visc denotes the viscous heating. We use both a constant shear kinematic viscosity, \u03bd = 10\u22125\nin code units, and a von Neumann-Richtmyer artificial bulk viscosity, as described in Stone & Norman (1992), where the coefficient C2 is taken equal to 1.4 (C2 measures the number of\n1\n\nSee: http://fargo.in2p3.fr\n\n\fF. Marzari et al.: Radiative discs in close binaries\n\nzones over which the artificial viscosity spreads out shocks). The\n4\ncooling source term in Eq. (2), Q\u2212cool , is taken equal to 2\u03c3SB T eff\n,\nwhere \u03c3SB is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T eff is the effective temperature (Hubeny 1990),\n\nand\n\n4\nT eff\n= T 4 /\u03c4eff ,\n\nwhere Md denotes the disc's mass, and e and \u031f are the eccentricity and pericenter longitude of each grid cell, respectively,\nassuming that the local position and velocity vectors uniquely\ndefine a 2-body Keplerian orbit.\n\nwith effective optical depth\n\u221a\n3\u03c4\n3\n1\n\u03c4eff =\n+\n+ .\n8\n4\n4\u03c4\n\n(3)\n\n\u031fd = Md\u22121 \u00d7\n\n\"\n\n\u031f(r, \u03c6)\u03a3(r, \u03c6)rdrd\u03c6\n\n(6)\n\n(4)\n\nThe vertical optical depth, \u03c4, is approximated as \u03c4 = \u03ba\u03a3/2,\nwhere for the Rosseland mean opacity, \u03ba, the formulae in\nBell & Lin (1994) are adopted. Following Paardekooper et al.\n(2011), we also model thermal diffusion as diffusion of the\ngas entropy, s, defined as s = R(\u03b3 \u2212 1)\u22121 log(p/\u03a3\u03b3 ). This\ncorresponds to the last term in the right-hand side of Eq. (2),\nwhere \u03bb is a constant thermal diffusion coefficient. Throughout\nthis study, we adopt \u03bb = 10\u22126 in code units.\nInitial conditions- The disc is initially axisymmetric and the\nangular frequency \u03a9(r) about the primary star is computed\ntaking into account the radial acceleration due to the pressure\ngradient, the gravitational acceleration due to the primary\nstar only and the self\u2013gravity of the disk. The initial gas\nsurface density, \u03a30 , is set as \u03a30 (r) = \u03a30 (1 AU) \u00d7 (r/1 AU)\u22121/2\nwith \u03a30 (1 AU) = 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22124 in code units. Assuming the\nmass of the primary star is 1M\u2299 , this corresponds to setting\nthe disc surface density at 1 AU to \u2248 2.2 \u00d7 103 g cm\u22122 .\nBeyond 11 AU, \u03a30 (r) is smoothly reduced to a floor value,\n\u03a3floor = 10\u22129 = 4 \u00d7 10\u22126 \u03a30 (1 AU), using a Gaussian function\nwith standard deviation equal to 0.4 AU. To prevent numerical\ninstabilities caused by low density values or by steep density\ngradients near the grid's outer edge, the gas density in each\ngrid cell is reset to \u03a3floor whenever it becomes smaller than\nthis floor value (Kley et al. 2008, Paper I). Similarly, we adopt\na floor value for the thermal energy density, efloor = 10\u221218 .\nOur choice for this parameter is conservative, and we checked\nthat with a larger efloor , the modelled disc behaved similarly.\nThe initial gas temperature, T 0 , is taken proportional to r\u22121 :\nT 0 = T 0 (1 AU) \u00d7 (r/1 AU)\u22121 , where the value for T 0 (1 AU),\nwhich is taken as a free parameter in our study, will be specified\nbelow. Writing the pressure scale height H as H = cS \u03a9\u22121\nK ,\nwhere cS denotes the sound speed and \u03a9K the Keplerian\nangular frequency, the disc temperature can be conveniently\nrelated to the disc's aspect ratio, h = H/r. In our code units,\nwhere R/\u03bc = 1, this yields T 0 (1 AU) = 630 K\u00d7{h(1 AU)/0.05}2.\nBoundary conditions- By default, an outflow zero-gradient\nboundary condition is adopted at both the grid's inner and outer\nedges. The azimuthal velocity is set to its initial, axisymmetric\nvalue. No mass therefore flows back into the system, and the\ndisk mass declines with time. The impact of the inner boundary\ncondition on our results is examined in Sect. 4.3.\n2.3. Notations\n\nWe will make use of the following quantities. We denote\nby ed and \u031fd the disc's eccentricity and perihelion longitude, respectively. They are defined as in Kley et al. (2008);\nPierens & Nelson (2007); Marzari et al. (2009):\n\"\ned = Md\u22121 \u00d7\ne(r, \u03c6)\u03a3(r, \u03c6)rdrd\u03c6\n(5)\n\n3. Locally isothermal disc models\nBefore examining the impact of an energy equation on the disc's\nresponse to the tidal perturbations by the secondary star, we\nadopt in this section the simpler case for a locally isothermal\nequation of state, where the initial (axisymmetric) profile of the\ndisc temperature remains fixed. This first step will help us analyze the more complex situation of a disc whose temperature\nevolves in time due to radiative cooling and various sources of\nheating, including that arising from the shock waves induced by\nthe secondary.\n3.1. Disc's eccentricity and surface density profiles\n\nWe carried out a series of simulations using a range of values for\nthe disc's aspect ratio at 1 AU, h(1 AU). This comes to varying\nthe disc's temperature at the same location. Other disc and binary\nparameters are as described in Sect. 2.2. We consider two different values for the secondary-to-primary mass ratio: q = 0.4 (our\nfiducial value), and q = 0.1. Results of simulations with q = 0.4\nare shown in the upper panels in Fig. 1, and those with q = 0.1\nin the lower panels. Azimuthally- and time-averaged profiles of\nthe disc's eccentricity and surface density are displayed in the\nleft and right columns of Fig. 1, respectively. Profiles are displayed after \u223c 60 orbits of the secondary, and time averaging is\ndone over 5 orbits. By checking the time evolution of the disc's\neccentricity profile, we find that a steady state is reached after\ntypically 20 binary revolutions with q = 0.4 for all values of h,\nand after 40 revolutions for q = 0.1. The value of h(1 AU) is\nindicated in each panel (and simply denoted by h).\nWe are primarily interested in the disc's averaged eccentricity in its inner parts, below the truncation radius located at\nr \u223c 5 \u2212 6 AU for q = 0.4, where planet formation is more\nlikely to occur. As shown in Marzari et al. (2009), the truncation radius of the disc closely matches the critical limit for orbital stability due to the secular perturbations of the companion\nstar (Holman & Wiegert 1999). From Fig. 1, it is clear that the\ndisc eccentricity increases from r \u223c 4 AU downwards, peaks at\nr . 1 AU, then decreases towards the location of the grid's inner\nedge, where the boundary condition imposes zero eccentricity.\nInterestingly, we see that the averaged peak eccentricity of the\ndisc (reached at r . 1 AU) increases with h up to h = 0.05 and\ndecreases beyond this value. The same behavior is obtained with\nboth values of q. This behavior may be interpreted as follows.\nThe disc's density perturbation due to the secondary decreases\nwith increasing disc aspect ratio (h or, equivalently, increasing sound speed). In the limit of large aspect ratios, the disc's\neccentricity thus decreases with increasing h. As h decreases,\nthe disc's perturbed density increases, but shock waves become\nmore tightly wound, and have to travel a longer distance before\nreaching the disc's inner parts. Being then more prone to viscous\ndamping, shock waves become less and less efficient at depositing angular momentum in the disc's inner parts, where the eccentricity remains small. This explains why when decreasing h,\n3\n\n\fF. Marzari et al.: Radiative discs in close binaries\n\n4. Radiative discs models\nIn this section, we describe the results of our hydrodynamical\nsimulations that include an energy equation. Our aim is to assess\nthe impact of the energy equation on the disc's averaged eccentricity.\n4.1. Disc eccentricity\n\n0.12\nIsothermal\nRadiative\n0.1\n0.08\nEccentricity\n\nthe averaged eccentricity of the disc's inner parts first reaches a\nmaximum and then decreases.\nWe can see in Fig. 1 that the radial dependence of the density and eccentricity profiles reasonably match each other, as\nexpected. The general trend is that the larger the disc's eccentricity profile, the smaller the surface density profile. Note that\nthis is more visible for q = 0.4, where the density's perturbation by the secondary takes larger values than for q = 0.1. The\nsignificant decrease in the disc's density profile in the disc inner\nparts (typically below \u223c 2 AU) takes the form of an elliptic inner\nhole, which has been observed in a number of previous numerical studies (e.g., Kley et al. 2008, Paper I).\nOur results concerning the dependence of the disc's eccentricity and density profiles with h differ from those of Kley et al.\n(2008), but this depends on intrinsic differences in the models.\nIn particular, we consider more massive discs and we include the\neffects of self-gravity which proved to be efficient in affecting the\ndisc evolution.\n\n0.06\n\n3.2. Fourier analysis of the density distribution\n\n0.04\n\nTo provide some insight into the dependence of the disc's eccentricity and density profiles with varying temperature, we examine in this paragraph the Fourier components of the disc's surface density. Fig. 3 displays the instantaneous amplitude of the\nFourier mode coefficients with azimuthal wavenumber 1 \u2264 m \u2264\n5. Results are shown at 2550 yr, that is after \u2248 20 orbits of the\nsecondary, when the disc is truncated at about 7-8 AU. We compare the profiles obtained for previous series of locally isothermal disc models for q = 0.4, with h = 0.02 (left panel) and\nh = 0.06 (right panel). The secondary star is half-way between\nthe pericenter and apocenter at this particular point in time.\nFrom Fig. 3, it is clear that the amplitude of Fourier mode coefficients decreases with increasing m, and that the m = 1 mode\nprevails. The run with h = 0.06 displays larger mode amplitudes\nthroughout the disc's inner parts, which accounts for the larger\ndisc eccentricity obtained in this case. Also, the large amplitude\nof the m = 1 mode below r \u2248 1 for h = 0.06 is directly associated to the presence of an elliptic inner hole, whose presence has\nalready been pointed out in the upper panels in Fig. 1.\n\n0.02\n0\n0\n\nPericenter (deg)\n\n80\n\n100\n\nIsothermal\nRadiative\n\nPericenter (rad)\n\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n20\n\n40\n60\nBinary revolutions\n\n80\n\n100\n\nFig. 5.

All other disc\nparameters are as described in Sect. 2. Fig. 4 shows contours of\nthe disc's surface density at 90 binary orbits obtained with two\nvalues of the binary's eccentricity: eb = 0.4 (upper panels) and\neb = 0 (lower panels). As already pointed out in Sect. 3, eccentric streamlines (m = 1 density mode) have different values of\nthe pericenter depending on the radial distance, and, as a consequence, they combine into a pattern of spiral structure. However,\nthe discs computed with the radiative model (left-handed plots\nin Fig. 4) appear smoother and more symmetric than the corresponding locally isothermal discs, and, in particular, they do not\nfeature any elliptic hole near the inner edge, independently of\neb . The spiral density waves are less strong in the radiative case\nand this is possibly related to the absence of a low density region\nclose to the star.

Azimuthally- and time-averaged profiles of the disc's eccentricity (left column) and surface density (\u03a3, right column) obtained\nwith the series of locally isothermal disc models described in Sect. 3. In the density profile plots the initial, unperturbed profile is\nshown as reference. Results are shown at 60 orbits of the secondary, and time-averaging is done over 5 orbits. Several values of the\ndisc's aspect ratio at 1 AU are considered and two secondary-to-primary mass ratios: q = 0.4 (upper panels) and q = 0.1 (lower\npanels).\nare shown as a function of time in Fig. 5 and they confirm that\nthe radiative case has, on average, a lower eccentricity even if it\ntakes more time to reach a steady state. The perihelion libration,\nobserved also for the radiative case, strongly suggests that this\nbehaviour is solely due to the disc self-gravity and that it does\nnot depend on the energy equation. By inspecting the radial pericenter profile, even in the radiative case the azimuthally averaged\npericenter of the gas streamlines changes with radial distance (as\nis illustrated in Fig 2 for a locally isothermal model). This variation, in addition to causing spiral waves, leads to an asymmetric distribution of mass and then to a non-symmetric disc gravity\nfield. This is critical for planetesimals embedded in the disc since\nthe non-homogeneous disc forces non-radial components on the\ngravity field felt by planetesimals significantly perturbing their\norbits. These perturbations are comparable in magnitude to the\nsecular effects of the companion star but are irregular and may\nthen cause larger changes in the planetesimals orbital elements.\nThey are indeed an indirect effect of the companion gravity but\nfor planetesimals they represent an independent source of perturbation.\nTo get further insight into the different densities and eccentricities with and without an energy equation, we carried out\ntwo additional locally isothermal disc models. In the first model,\nthe initial temperature is set to the time-averaged temperature\n\nprofile of the above radiative run. In the second model, the initial temperature is chosen to give the same sound speed profile\nas the time-averaged one in the radiative run. In Sect. 3.1, we\npointed out that the disc eccentricity in locally isothermal models strongly depends on the aspect ratio h and, as a consequence,\non the temperature profile (see Fig. 1). In Fig. 6, bottom plot,\nwe compare the temperature profile of the locally isothermal\nmodel with h = 0.05 to the time-averaged temperature profile\nof the radiative model. The temperature in the radiative run is\nsignificantly larger, implying that we should compare the radiative model to a locally isothermal model with h \u223c 0.07. In the\ntop panel of Fig. 6, we display the eccentricity and density profiles in all four models: (i) the radiative model, (ii) the locally\nisothermal model with same initial aspect ratio as in the radiative\nmodel, (iii) the locally isothermal model with same temperature\nprofile as in the radiative case, and (iv) the locally isothermal\nmodel with same sound speed profile as in the radiative one. The\ndisc eccentricity in models (iii) and (iv) is smaller than in model\n(ii), as expected from the results shown in Fig. 1 (top-left panel).\nConsequently, the disc surface density remains larger in models\n(iii) and (iv) compared to in model (ii). Still, models (iii) and\n(iv) do not match the low eccentricity of the radiative case and\nits smooth density distribution close to the star. The strength of\nthe m = 1 Fourier mode in the radiative run is smaller in the\n5\n\n\fF.

In Fig. 7, we display density contours obtained\nwith the radiative run (left panel), and with the locally isothermal\nmodel with same temperature profile (right panel). In the radiative model, the wave perturbations are less strong and the waves\nappear to be more damped. Being weaker in the inner disc parts\nin the radiative case, waves should be less efficient at depositing angular momentum there. This would explain why radiative\ndiscs are less eccentric in the regions close to the central star,\nand why the surface density is more homogeneous.\n4.2. Radiative damping of waves\n\nThe main question arising from previous results is what causes\na stronger damping of density waves in the radiative model than\nin the locally isothermal one, while the same (time-averaged)\nsound speed profile is adopted in both models. In Fig. 6, the\nradiative model shows indeed a significantly lower eccentricity\nprofile. Assuming the disc eccentricity is related to the strength\nof the density waves induced by the binary gravitational perturbations, we have shown in Fig. 7 that spiral waves are more\ndamped in the radiative case.\nThere are two potential sources of wave damping that may\nhelp understand why the disc eccentricity remains lower in the\nradiative case: shock damping (Goodman & Rafikov 2001) and\nradiative damping (Cassen & Woolum 1996). To explore the efficiency of the shock damping mechanism, we examined the\nvortensity distribution in the disc, since it experiences a jump\nat shocks, the magnitude of which depends on the strength of\nthe shock. We did not observe significant differences in the disc\nvortensity distribution between the two models and thus we believe that shock damping does not significantly contribute to the\nsmoother behaviour of the radiative disc.\nThe energy loss by radiation is an additional possible source\nof wave damping (Cassen & Woolum 1996). Wave propagation\nthrough adiabatic compressions and expansions may be damped\nby radiative losses which, in our model, are controlled by the\ncooling term Q\u2212cool . To test this hypothesis, we restarted our standard radiative simulation (eb = 0.4, Ms = 0.4M\u2299 and ab = 30\nAU) after 165 binary revolutions adopting different two cooling\nprescriptions. In a first run, we limit the cooling time throughout\n6\n\nthe disc to be no less than that at 6 AU from the star (that is,\nabout 150 yr). To keep the temperature profile as close as possible to that of the standard radiative model, and thus to prevent\ndiscrepancies related to different temperature profiles, we limit\nthe viscous heating timescale by a similar amount. In a second\nrun, we increase the cooling rate throughout the entire disc by\na factor of 10, and the viscous heating rate is increased accordingly. Both restart simulations were run for 50 additional binary\norbits, over which the disc's temperature profile does not evolve\nsignificantly, except within 1 AU from the central star.\nFig. 8 compares the disc time-averaged eccentricity and temperature profiles of the standard radiative model with those of the\nadditional models with longer and shorter cooling times. The inner disc's eccentricity is significantly increased with longer cooling timescale, exceeding \u223c 0.1 almost uniformly from R = 2\nAU to R = 6 AU. This value is in good agreement with that of\nthe locally isothermal run with same sound speed profile (see\nFig. 6). However, close to the inner edge the disc eccentricity is\nstill small but this is possibly due to the fact that we cannot maintain constant the temperature profile within 1 AU of the central\nstar in the model with reduced cooling. In the restart simulation\nwith a cooling rate 10 times larger, the disc eccentricity is about\nhalf that of the standard radiative model, while the corresponding temperature profiles hardly differ.\nThe results shown in Fig. 8 suggest that radiative damping is\nresponsible for the limited growth in the disc eccentricity compared to to similar locally isothermal disc models. This mechanism, like self-gravity, helps maintaining the disc eccentricity to\na mild value.\n4.3. Dependence on the boundary conditions\n\nWe examine in this paragraph the dependence of our results on\nthe choice for the boundary condition at the grid's inner edge.\nFor this purpose, we compare the results of simulations using\nour fiducial boundary condition (zero-gradient outflow boundary condition, see Sect. 4.1) with those of two additional simulations:\n- One using a viscous outflow boundary condition\n(Kley & Nelson 2008).

The profiles are in good agreement for all three\ndifferent boundary conditions. Note that the surface density in\nthe inner disc for the viscous boundary condition is larger than\nwith the two other boundaries. This is expected, since the imposed viscous drift velocity is smaller that the radial velocity set\nby the propagation of the spiral waves induced by the secondary.\nA similar good agreement is obtained with a radiative model, as\n7\n\n\fF.

Dependence on the binary eccentricity\n\nIn paper I, we showed that the disc eccentricity ed decreases with\nincreasing binary eccentricity, the circular case (eb = 0) being\nthe most perturbing configuration. We interpreted this result as\nbeing due to the larger size of the disc for lower values of eb ,\nand to the consequent larger number of resonant perturbations\nwhich may affect it. The eccentricity of radiative discs, however,\nseems to be rather insensitive to eb . The outcome of the simulations at different eb is shown in the left plot of Fig. 11, where\nwe compare the values of ed obtained for locally isothermal and\nradiative discs. In contrast to locally isothermal discs, the averaged ed of radiative discs is almost constant around 0.05, and it\ndoes not show a significant dependence with eb . However, the\nazimuthally-averaged profile of the disc's eccentricity over the\nradiative disc does depend on eb . In Fig. 12, the radial profile of\nthe disc's eccentricity is shown for different values of eb rang-\n\ning from 0 to 0.6. We note that the eccentricity profiles significantly differ even if the position of the star with respect to the\ninitial reference frame is the same. All radiative runs show an\nincreasing eccentricity profile towards large radii, whereas locally isothermal runs feature a peak in the eccentricity in the\ninner disc parts for most values of h. It should be pointed out\nthat the above comparison is done by adopting the same initial\naspect ratio for radiative and locally isothermal disc models. A\ndifferent approach would be to compare disc models with same\ntemperature or sound speed profiles, as is done in Figs. 7 and 6.\nBut, when comparing the temperature profiles of the radiative\ndiscs, we find that they correspond to locally isothermal discs\nwith h \u223c 0.06 \u2212 0.07, which anyway feature a larger eccentricity\nin the disc inner parts.\nIn the right panel of Fig. 11 we also compare the values of\nthe outer semi-major axis ad of the ellipse best fitting the outer\nedge of the disc (at a density level of \u03a3 = 10\u22126 , code units).\nThe radiative discs extend slightly farther out compared to the\ncorresponding locally isothermal discs, except for our fiducial\nbinary's eccentricity (eb = 0.4), where the disc's size is approx9\n\n\fF.

In the right plot, we show the disc's size for different values\nof eb , more specifically the semi-major axis of the ellipse that best fits the disc density at a level \u03a3 = 10\u22126 (code units).\nimately equal to its isothermal counterpart. The mass loss rate\nfor radiative discs, for different values of eb , is shown in Fig. 13.\nIt is computed with a linear fit of the time evolution of the disc\nmass when a steady state is reached, so it is independent from the\ninitial disc truncation process. It shows an almost linear dependence with eb and it is related to the strong perturbation effects\non the disc as the secondary star passes at pericenter. The inspection of the amount of mass stripped vs. time reveals that almost\nall the mass loss occurs during and after the pericenter passage of\nthe companion while a lower amount is constantly lost through\nthe inner border due to the disc eccentricity and viscosity. The\nabsolute value of the mass loss is large, and it predicts a reduction in the disc mass by a factor of two in about 3 \u00d7 104 yrs for\nour standard case (eb = 0.4). However, this value depends on\nthe disc mass, and a simulation with the same binary parameters\nbut an initial disc mass 10 times smaller gives a mass loss rate\n\u2248 3.7 \u00d7 10\u22129 M\u2299 /yr.\n4.5. Dependence on the disc mass\n\nIn Paper I, we found that for locally isothermal discs, a decrease\nin the disc mass had no significant impact on the disc eccentricity. Below we show that radiative discs behave differently. In\nFig. 14, we compare the disc eccentricity in the nominal case,\nwhere the initial density at 1 AU is that of the MMSN, to that of\na disc initially 2 and 10 times less massive. The disc eccentricity ed in a steady state is much larger for the less massive discs.\nThis is further illustrated by the contours of the disc density for\n\u03a30 = 0.1\u03a3MMSN in Fig. 15. The disc appears smaller and very\neccentric, particularly in its outer regions.\nIt is difficult to interpret this outcome on the basis of the\nisothermal simulations. Less massive radiative discs, like that\nshown in Fig. 15, have lower temperature profiles. This is presumably due to a faster cooling rate. According to our model, a\nlower surface density of the disc implies a smaller optical thickness that leads to a shorter cooling timescale. As a consequence,\nour standard model with \u03a30 = 1\u03a3MMSN has a stationary temperature profile which is equivalent to that of a locally isothermal run\nwith h \u223c 7 \u2212 8% while less massive discs have a lower temperature profile in a steady-state with a temperature typically 3 \u2212 4\ntimes less high. This translates into equivalent locally isothermal models with h down to 3 \u2212 4%. By inspecting Fig. 1 (top\nleft plot) we notice that in this range of aspect ratios, the disc's\neccentricity actually changes quickly with h. This might explain\n10\n\nwhy less massive radiative discs have different disk eccentricity.\nEven self\u2013gravity will play a minor role for less massive discs\nand in Paper I we showed that indeed self\u2013gravity is effective\nin reducing the disc eccentricity. This, however, is not the full\nstory and the different energy equation also plays a significant\nrole. The disc eccentricity radial profile of radiative discs, also\nthe less massive ones (see Fig. 14), does not peak close to the\nstar like for the isothermal discs (Fig. 1). The value of ed for\nradiative discs grows for larger values of R as predicted by the\nanalytical theory of Paardekooper et al. (2008). This behaviour\nis further illustrated by examining the Fourier components of the\nnormalized surface density. Fig. 16 compares the Fourier components for both our standard disc with \u03a30 = \u03a3MMSN , and the\ndisc model with \u03a30 = 0.1\u03a3MMSN . The m = 1 and m = 2 components are much stronger for the less massive disc, and they\naccount for the overall higher disc eccentricity. In the standard\ncase, the high disc density is able to damp efficiently the two\nFourier components of the binary perturbations as they move toward the disc inner parts. On the other hand, these components\npropagate further in for less massive discs, leading to a larger\nvalue for ed . However, also in the less massive disc they do not\nreach the inner part of the disc, like in isothermal discs, preventing the formation of an eccentric low-density region close to the\ncentral star.\nAccording to the results presented so far, isothermal and radiative discs behave differently. Massive isothermal discs in low\neccentricity binaries are expected to be eccentric for reasonable\nvalues of h while radiative discs always have low eccentricity.\nFor isothermal discs there is a weak dependence of the disc\neccentricity on the disc mass (see Paper I) while, for radiative\ndiscs, this dependence is strong with less massive discs being\nmore eccentric. Hot isothermal discs develop an inner eccentric\nhole while radiative discs are smooth also at the inner edge.\n\n5. Why is disc eccentricity so important?\nPlanetesimals!\nThe shape and profile of the gas disc may have a crucial role\nin the early stages of planetary formation, when kilometer-sized\nplanetesimals are colliding with each other. Even when neglecting gas disc gravity, several studies have shown that the coupling\nbetween secular perturbations and gas drag, which increases impact velocities between non-equal sized bodies and can lead to\naccretion-hostile environments (e.g. Th\u00e9bault et al. 2006, 2008,\n\n\fF.

Azimuthally- and time-averaged profiles of the disc's\neccentricity for three different initial surface densities: \u03a30 =\n\u03a3MMSN (our fiducial value), \u03a30 = 0.5\u03a3MMSN , and \u03a30 =\n0.1\u03a3MMSN .\n2009), leads to further increasing the relative velocity between\nplanetesimals if the gas disc gets eccentric (Paardekooper et al.\n2008; Xie et al. 2010). Disc gravity might further increase impact velocities by increasing the disc eccentricity and inducing\nadditional dynamical perturbations on planetesimals because of\nnon-isotropic distribution of the mass within the gas disc. The\nasymmetric distribution of mass within a massive disc can indeed significantly perturb the orbit of planetesimals, causing\nlarge eccentricities and unphased orbits, which may possibly halt\nthe accretion process.\nTo test this hypothesis we integrated the trajectories of planetesimals orbiting within 6 AU from the primary star, and\nwe computed their orbital evolution in 2D under the action\nof (i) stellar gravity, (ii) gas drag, and (iii) gas disc gravity. This procedure has been implemented in previous papers,\nbut with different assumptions like isothermal disc models, no\nself-gravity and different binary parameters (Paardekooper et al.\n2008; Kley & Nelson 2008). We first present in Fig. 17 the results of a test run without gas drag, for which we see that the\nplanetesimals eccentricity grows to large values regardless of\ntheir initial location in the disc. In addition, the drift towards\nthe inner region of the disc, which is typical of planetesimals\naround single stars, may be halted and even reversed. This dragfree case could probably describe the evolution of large plan11\n\n\fF.

For the disc and star parameters, we consider our\nstandard case.\nWe then present the results of a full simulation including\ngas drag, whose expression is given by the usual formulae Fd =\nK |vrel | vrel , where vrel is the relative velocity vector of the planetesimal with respect to the gas, and the drag parameter K is\nequal to \u03c1g Cd /(8\u03c1pl s) (Kary et al. 1993), where s is the radius of\na given planetesimal, \u03c1pl its mass density, \u03c1g the gas density of\nthe protoplanetary disc, and Cd a dimensionless drag coefficient\nrelated to the planetesimals shape (\u223c 0.4 for spherical bodies).\nWe explore 3 values for K, corresponding to 10, 20 and 50 kmsized planetesimals in a MMSN disc, and we consider 2 initial\nlocations for the planetesimals: 1.5 AU and 3.5 AU from the primary. For the 1.5 AU case, the initial strong perturbations of the\n12\n\neccentric disc are partly damped by gas drag but the steady state\neccentricities are much larger than the forced eccentricity of the\ncompanion star (see Fig. 18, upper box). Moreover, these steady\nstate eccentricities do strongly vary with K, i.e. with planetesimal sizes: they are almost twice as large for 50 km-sized objects\nas for 10 km-sized ones. As for the pericenter longitudes, they\nrapidly converge to steady state values that only marginally vary\nwith planetesimal size. The evolution of the 3.5 AU case is different. The eccentricities decrease towards an equilibrium value\npredicted by the balancing between the forced component of the\ncompanion star, gas drag damping and disc gravity (see Fig. 18,\nlower plots) The steady state eccentricities are thus lower than in\nthe 1.5 AU case, despite being in a region where secondary perturbations are stronger. This result is in sharp contrast with what\nwas obtained by Paardekooper et al. (2008) for the gas drag-only\ncase, where eccentricities steadily increase with increasing semimajor axis (see Fig. 10b of that paper). It clearly illustrates the\nfact that the gas disc gravity, which is stronger in the inner and\ndenser part of the system, is the dominant mechanism controlling the planetesimals' dynamical evolution. The residual shortterm variations of the eccentricity, due to the companion's perturbations, are in contrast much larger in the 3.5 AU case than in\nthe 1.5 AU one. The pericenter alignment is maintained at this\ndistance even if it is less collimated, as expected since the gas\ndensity is lower.\nAssessing the consequences of these dynamical behaviors\non the accretion process would require estimating the distribution of impact velocities, vcoll , among the planetesimals population. It is here not possible to directly derive vcoll from the values of the eccentricity because of mutual orbital phasing. The\nsimple vcoll \u221d hei relation is in this case no longer valid and\nshould be replaced by vcoll \u221d \u03b1P hei, where the factor \u03b1P < 1\naccounts for the phasing. Unfortunately, proper velocity estimates are difficult to derive with the limited number of planetesimals (50) considered here. Simulations with at least a few\nthousands test particles would be necessary (e.g. Th\u00e9bault et al.\n2006; Paardekooper et al. 2008; Xie & Zhou 2009), but such\nnumbers are beyond the current computing capacities for a full\nmodel including the gas disc's gravity. However, the preliminary\nresults displayed in Figs. 17 and 18 seem to indicate that encounter velocities are probably further increased by the action\nof disc gravity, and this for 2 reasons: (i) Even if a significant\norbital phasing is observed (right hand plots of Fig. 18) it is\nnevertheless not perfect, especially in the 3.5 AU case. Even in\nthe 1.5 AU case it is size-dependent, which increases the factor \u03b1P in any realistic planetesimal population with a size distribution. (ii) The values of the steady-state eccentricities are\nhigher than in the gas-drag only case, especially closer to the\nstar where velocities are relatively low in the gas-drag only runs\n(compare for example the upper-left graph of Fig. 18 to Fig. 10\nof Paardekooper et al. (2008)). These steady-state eccentricities\nare in addition strongly size-dependent. These two effects separately increase each of the two components, \u03b1P and hei, controlling the value of the encounter velocities. The extent of this\nvelocity increase, and thus its concrete effect on the accretion\nprocess, cannot be quantitatively estimated here. It will be the\npurpose of a forthcoming study specifically addressing this issue. We are however confident that the general tendency is for\ndisc gravity to act against planetesimal accretion.\n\n6. Concluding remarks\nWe have shown that the evolution of a circumstellar disc in\nclose binary-star systems strongly depends on the disc's mass\n\n\fF.

Planetesimal orbital evolution without the gas drag\nforce. Large values of eccentricity are excited by the nonhomogeneous distribution of mass within the disc. The highest\neccentricity value is observed closer to the star where the companion gravitational perturbations are weaker.\n\nand thermodynamical properties. In locally isothermal disc models, where the temperature profile remains constant with time,\nthe averaged eccentricity in the disc inner parts changes dramatically with varying the disc temperatures (or, equivalently,\nthe disc aspect ratios h = H/r), as illustrated in Fig. 1. In our\nmodel, the disc eccentricity typically peaks at \u2248 0.4 for h \u2248 0.05.\nSuch large eccentricities result in the formation of an internal\nelliptic low-density region in the disc. Radiative discs, on the\nother hand, have a smoother density profile, and their eccentric-\n\nity takes smaller values than in locally isothermal models with\nsame temperature profile. Radiative damping of the waves induced by the secondary companion contributes to keep the disc\neccentricity to a fairly small value, which in our model typically\namounts to \u223c 0.05 in the disc inner parts.\nIn both locally isothermal and radiative discs, self-gravity\ncauses the libration of the disc orientation at an angle \u03c0 with\nrespect to the apsidal line of the binary orbit. However, the libration is not coherent within the disc, and the orientation of the gas\nstreamlines changes with radial distance.\nThe averaged disc eccentricity in radiative discs is almost\ninsensitive to the binary's eccentricity, although it should slowly\nincrease with time as the disc mass decreases due to its viscous\nevolution. A disc that is 10 times less massive than our nominal\ndisc (that is, having \u03a30 = 0.1\u03a3MMSN ) has a large eccentricity\n(about 0.3 for eb = 0.4). This behavior is not observed in locally\nisothermal discs.\nBased on these different behaviors, we may envision an evolutionary track for discs in binaries. In the earlier stages, the disc\nis massive and probably optically thick so it is well described by\nradiative models. Its eccentricity should therefore remain small,\naround 0.05, and its radial density profile be smooth. Later, because of the viscous evolution, the disc progressively loses mass.\nThis occurs at a fast rate for binaries with large values of eb (see\nFig. 11). If the disc is still optically thick, and the radiative model\nis appropriate, its eccentricity is expected to grow because of the\ndependence of ed with the disc mass (see Fig. 14). If, finally,\nthe disc becomes optically thin, a locally isothermal equation of\nstate may then be more appropriate. In this case, the disc eccentricity will change and depend on eb as shown in Marzari et al.\n(2009). At the same time, hotter discs will develop an internal\n13\n\n\fF.

Even when gas drag is included, the perturbations by the\neccentric disc entail large planetesimals eccentricities, in particular in the inner zones of the disc. It is necessary to evaluate the\nimpact of this eccentricity on the accumulation process of planetesimals.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank an anonymous referee for his useful comments and\nsuggestions that helped to improve the paper.
