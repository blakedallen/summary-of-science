Indeed, there are normally legal\nrequirements to do so. However, online disabled access is still a\nrelatively novel field. Most museums have not yet considered the\nissues in depth. The Human-Computer Interface for their websites\nis normally tested with major browsers, but not with specialist\nbrowsers or against the relevant accessibility and validation\nstandards. We consider the current state of the art in this area and\nmention an accessibility survey of some museum websites.\n\nCategories and Subject Descriptors\nH.5.1 [Information interfaces and presentation (e.g., HCI)]:\nUser Interfaces \u2013 benchmarking, evaluation/methodology,\ngraphical user interfaces (GUI), input devices and strategies,\ninteraction styles, screen design, standardization, style guides,\nuser-centered design, voice I/O.\n\nGeneral Terms\nDesign, Human Factors, Standardization, Languages, Legal\nAspects, Verification.\n\n[www.archimuse.com/mw2003/best]. As an example, the Natural\nHistory Museum of Los Angeles County in the US\n[www.nhm.org] has been an exemplary website from the point of\nview of accessibility. This was largely because someone who is\nvery knowledgeable of the issues involved designed and\norganized it in-house over a number of years. Perhaps the most\ninteresting thing about this and other websites designed with\naccessibility in mind is that they need look no different on a\nmodern graphical web browser from any other professionally\ndesigned website. This demonstrates that designing with\naccessibility in mind does not mean one has to compromise what\nis on offer for the able bodied user with good web browsing\nfacilities.\nThe British Museum COMPASS database of a selection of the\nmuseum's best objects [www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/compass]\nincludes a prominent 'TEXT ONLY' link at the top of its homepage\nfor disabled users to gain easy access to the available facilities.\nThe information for the graphical and text-based information is\nserved from the same database, thus ensuring that both are in step\nand up to date.\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nThe Tate Gallery in London initiated the i-Map Project in\nassociated with a major exhibition on Matisse and Picasso in 2002\n[www.tate.org.uk/imap]. This was designed to give access for\nvisually impaired people via the web using raised images\nallowing them to be touched if printed on a special printer. Thus\neven art galleries that are obviously very visually oriented in\ngeneral can make efforts to reach out to the blind.\n\nA cartoon in The New Yorker magazine on 5 July 1993 showed a\npicture of a dog at a computer talking to his friend and saying:\n\n3. SURVEY RESULTS\n\nKeywords\nAccessibility, Disabled Access, Museums, Usability, WWW.\n\nOn the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog.\n\u2013 Peter Steiner\nA significant number of people using the Internet in general and\nthe web in particular have some form of disability that may affect\ntheir use of the technology. Of course the World Wide Web\nConsortium (W3C) is aware of the issues [9] but many sectors\nstill have little awareness of the access problems to their websites.\nMuseums normally pride themselves on the accessibility of their\nphysical buildings but many have yet to make an equivalent effort\nfor their online facilities, despite the fact that legislation is in the\noffing or already exists in most developed countries.\n\n2. EXAMPLE MUSEUM WEBSITES\nIt is instructive to consider some museum sites where accessibility\nhas been considered. This is now an aspect that is assessed in the\nMuseums and the Web conference Best of the Web awards\nCopyright is held by the author.\nWWW 2003, May 20-24, 2003, Budapest, Hungary.\nACM.\n\nThe Bobby validator [bobby.watchfire.com], which can check for\nWAI compliance [9] and also the US Government Section 508\ncompliance [www.section508.gov] has been used to evaluate the\naccessibility and usability of 25 UK and 25 international museum\nand related websites with respect to their disabled accessibility\n(and hence usability) [3,5,6]. Bobby evaluates web pages for\naccessibility to users with disabilities. It checks for the presence\nor absence of particular features, or their characteristics, although\nit does not explicitly check HTML syntax. The W3C validator is\nrecommended for checking HTML itself [validator.w3.org]. The\nresults of this survey can be found in [6].\nAs well as the mechanical check using Bobby, a visual analysis\nwas carried out manually using information provided by Bobby\nand also with textual browsing (e.g., using an audio browser) and\npartial sightedness in mind. Generally the sites faired quite badly\nwith a significant number exhibiting some serious accessibility\nproblems. The overall results for Bobby are shown in Table 1,\nextracted from [6]. Priority 1 errors are most serious and must be\n\n\fcorrected to meet the WAI guidelines [9]. Priority 2 errors should\nbe corrected if possible and Priority 3 errors may be corrected.\nTable 1.

OTHER SOURCES OF INFORMATION\nAn excellent guide with museums specifically in mind is the EdResources.Net Universal Access website by Jim Angus [www.edresources.net/universalaccess]. This includes an interesting\ncomparison of the accessibility of three museum websites, as well\nas links to online web page validation services and further\nrelevant resources.\nIn the UK, MAGDA, the Museums & Galleries Disability\nAssociation [www.magda.org.uk] is dedicated to improving\naccess to UK museums and galleries for people with disabilities\nas well as disseminating current best practice. It also provides an\nonline forum for museum and gallery professionals to enable\nonline discussion [groups.yahoo.com/group/magdamail].\nThe number of books explicitly covering web accessibility has\nbeen very limited until recently, but at least three are now\navailable. [7] was the first book in the area known to the author.\n[8] is written by a range of experts, including legal aspects in\nsome detail for example, and as such is perhaps the most\nauthoritative book in this area to date. [4], the most recent book,\nmay be more approachable for some web designers. It is hoped\nthat more books in this important subject area will be produced in\nthe future.\n\n5. CONCLUSION\nThis poster is intended to help raise awareness of the issues\nconcerning disabled access online, especially in the context of\nmuseums that are increasingly developing their online resources\nwith ever-more sophisticated web technologies.\nFor people with learning disabilities, visual disabilities, and\nreading impairments, print-based text can be completely\ninaccessible. While in recent years software developers have\ncreated electronic screen readers that convert text to speech, few\n\nof these programs offer effective control over how the text is\ndisplayed and read, nor do they provide flexible reading features.\nTherefore, for those with visual impairments, learning disabilities,\nreading disabilities, or language proficiency problems, even\nelectronic text can be difficult to decipher. The World Wide Web\nposes additional barriers; while the web provides a great deal of\nuseful, educational information, its reading levels, page design,\nand emphasis on graphics can make it inaccessible or unusable for\nsome.\nThere is much room for improvement in the reading and speaking\nqualities of screen readers. The museum website accessibility\nsurvey mentioned here [6] has shown that in order to develop\nbetter accessibility the emphasis must be on improved web page\ncoding practice. The coding aspects of web pages is extremely\nimportant in ensuring wide accessibility of websites that will be\nuseful to all, both able bodied and disabled alike. This is possible\nwith care and thought, but most web design professionals have yet\nto attain the skills to do this. It is hoped that this paper will at least\nraise some awareness and interest in the issues involved,\nparticularly for museums and other public bodies that pride\nthemselves in their accessibility.\nThe Museophile initiative [www.museophile.com], a spinout from\nSouth Bank University, aims to help museums online in areas\nsuch as e-commerce, discussion forums and accessibility. In\nparticular, for online information on web accessibility for\nmuseums, see:\n\nhttp://access.museophile.net\nAn expanded paper including fuller details is also available [3].\n\n6.
