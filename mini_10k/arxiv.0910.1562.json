(We then write aij , bj , c \u2208 Cb\u221e RN and we denote the class\nof these operators by L.) We also assume that L is uniformly strongly\nelliptic, namely that there exists a constant \u03b3 > 0 such that\n(1.2)\n\nX\nij\n\n2\n\naij (x)\u03bei \u03bej \u2265 \u03b3k\u03bek ,\n\n2\n\nk\u03bek :=\n\nN\nX\n\n\u03bei2 ,\n\ni=1\n\nfor all (\u03be, x) \u2208 RN \u00d7 RN . We define the matrix A(x) := [aij (x)], which,\nwithout loss of generality, we can assume to be symmetric. In view of\nthe applications we are interested in, we take the coefficients of L to be\nreal-valued. The set of operators L \u2208 L satisfying (1.2) will be denoted\nby L\u03b3 .\nWe study the short time asymptotic of the initial value problem (IVP)\nfor the parabolic operator \u2202t \u2212 L:\n(\n\u2202t u(t, x) \u2212 Lu(t, x) = g(t, x)\nin (0, \u221e) \u00d7 RN\n(1.3)\nu(0, x) = f (x),\non {0} \u00d7 RN ,\nfor u, f , and g in suitable function spaces. In view of Duhamel's\nprinciple, we may assume g = 0.\nWhen b(x), c(x) 6= 0 in (1.1), the corresponding parabolic equation\n\u2202t u \u2212 Lu = 0 is collectively referred to as a Fokker-Planck equation.\nFokker-Planck equations arise in many applications, for example in\nstatistical mechanics [15, 26], and more generally in probability.\nWe can also replace RN with a manifold of bounded geometry [18,\n41], which thus allows us to treat also some degenerate elliptic operators\nL. In particular, the approach in this paper can be extended to the\ncase of operators of the form \u2202t \u2212 (ax2 \u2202x2 + bx\u2202x + c) acting on Rt \u00d7 Rx+\nand to other operators that appear in practice. This extension is work\nin progress [18]. See also below for a more detailed discussion of this\npoint.\nIt is known that there exists G L \u2208 C \u221e ((0, \u221e) \u00d7 RN \u00d7 RN ) such that\nZ\n(1.4)\nu(t, x) =\nG L (t, x, y)f (y)dy, t > 0,\nRN\n\nis a solution of the above equation, and it is unique if f and u satisfy\ncertain growth conditions, specified later (see for instance [22], page\n2\n\n\f237). We will often write G L (t, x, y) = GtL (x, y). In case we have\nuniqueness, we shall also use the notation u(t) = etL f . The operator etL\nis then called the solution operator of the problem (1.3), and its kernel\nGtL the Green's function, or fundamental solution of L, or conditional\nprobability density in applications to probability.\nFor L with constant coefficients and for a few other cases, one can\nexplicitly compute the kernel G L . In general however, it is not known\nhow to provide explicit formulas for G L , though there is a large literature on developing methods to obtaining good asymptotic formulas for\nthe Green's function for t small and x close to y. For example, interpreting the operator L as a Laplace-Beltrami operator on a manifold\nplus lower order terms, lead to formal asymptotic expansions of the\nform\nd(x,y)2\n\n\u0001\ne\u2212 4t\nGt (x, y) =\nG (0) (x, y) + G (1) (x, y)t + G (2) (x, y)tn + . . . ,\nN/2\n(4\u03c0t)\n\nas t \u2192 0+ , where d(x, y) is the geodesic distance between x and y and\nG (j) (x, y) are smooth functions in x and y. Among the vast literature\nwe refer to [4, 49, 33, 42, 46, 55, 55, 57], (see also [24, 29, 43, 50] for\na pseudo-differential operator perspective). However, one difficulty in\nthe practical implementation of this geometric approach is that, except\nagain in special cases, there is no closed form solution to the geodesic\nequations used in defining d(x, y), which thus needs to be accurately\napproximated or computed numerically.\nA related short-time asymptotic approach uses oscillatory type integrals, which gives:\nX\n\u0001 (x\u2212y)T A(x)\u22121 *(x\u2212y)\n4t\n(1.5) G L (t, x, y) \u223c\nt(j\u2212n)/2 pj x, t\u22121/2 (x \u2212 y) e\u2212\n,\nj\u22650\n\nas t \u2192 0+ , where pj (x, w) is a polynomial of degree j in w, and A(x) :=\n[aij (x)]. (We follow here Taylor [50, Chapter 7, Section 13], where an\nasymptotic parametrix for the heat equation on compact manifolds\nwas constructed.) Finally, we mention the recent approaches in [1]\nusing multivariate Hermite expansions, and in [10] using an alternate\nconstruction of a parametrix approximation.\nIn our paper, we devise a new, elementary method to obtain asymptotic expansions similar and even more general than (1.5). Our method\nis based on dilating the coefficients of L around a point z with ratio\nt1/2 , then expanding in a Taylor series in t. We regard this expansion\nas a perturbation of the operator L0 obtained from L by freezing coefficients at z. We then use a Dyson-series perturbative expansion to\napproximate the heat-kernel of L. The Dyson-series expansion turns\n3\n\n\fout to be explicitly computable using the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff\ncommutator formula. We call the resulting method the Dyson-Taylor\ncommutator method. We think that our method is more accurate and\nmore stable in practical implementations [19, 18].\nThe main goal is to provide an explicit, algorithmic method to compute each term in the expansion, while at the same time obtain sharp\nerror bounds in both weighted and unweighted Sobolev spaces. We do\nnot work on compact manifolds, rather in RN , so that the error needs\nto be globally controlled (see below for a connection with operators\non non-compact manifolds of bounded geometry). In particular, our\napproximation is valid uniformly in x and y, provided t is small enough.\nWe think that our method, the Dyson-Taylor commutator method,\nis more elementary than the ones found in the literature and since it\nrelies on an iterative time-ordered perturbative formula for the solution\noperator etL , Equation (2.15), a parabolic rescaling argument, and a\nsuitable Taylor's expansion of the coefficients of L (equation 3.8). Since\nthe iterative formula is obtained via repeated applications of Duhamel's\nprinciple, we could also treat certain classes of semilinear equations\nfollowing Kato's method, which allows to take rougher data as well\n(see [36] in the context of the Navier-Stokes equations). We remark\nhere that a similar parabolic scaling combined with Taylor expansions\nhas been used in obtaining a short-time expansion for stochastic flows\n(see [7, 16]).\nOur main result is the following theorem. We introduce the weight\nhxi = (1 + |x|2 )1/2 . Below, Wam,p := Wam,p (RN ) is the exponentially\nweighted Sobolev space defined by\n\u0001\nWam,p (RN ) := {u : RN \u2192 C, \u2202x\u03b1 eahxi u(*) \u2208 Lp (RN ), |\u03b1| \u2264 m},\n\nfor 1 < p < \u221e, m \u2208 Z+ , and a \u2208 R. (See also Equation (2.4)). When\na = 0, we recover the usual Sobolev spaces. The need to consider\nexponentially weighted spaces arises in applications to probability, in\nparticular in stochastic volatility models. For instance, after making\nthe substitution x = ey , the payoff usually associated with the BlackScholes equation (equation (1.8) below) belongs to Wam,p with m = 1,\na < \u22121, and p large. We also denote\n(1.6)\n\nG(z; x) = (4\u03c0)\u2212N/2 det(A(z))\u22121/2 e\u2212x\n\nT A(z)\u22121 x/4\n\n,\n\nwhere z is a given point in RN . It is interesting to mention that the\nBlack-Scholes equation fits into the framework of manifolds with cylindrical ends, to which the results of Krainer [37] apply. Manifolds with\ncylindrical ends are the simplest examples of manifolds with bounded\ngeometry.\n4\n\n\fTo approximate the value of the Green function Gt (x, y) at some\npoint (x, y), we will use a Taylor-type expansion at the point z of a\nsuitable parabolic rescaling of the coefficients of L, which, however will\nbe chosen depending of x and y, z = z(x, y). Typically z(x, y) =\n\u03bbx + (1 \u2212 \u03bb)y, for some fixed \u03bb, but we can allow more general choices.\nNamely, we shall say that z(x, y) is admissible if z(x, x) = x and all\nderivatives \u2202 \u03b1 z are bounded for \u03b1 6= 0.\nTheorem 1.1. Let \u03bc \u2208 Z+P\n, L \u2208 L\u03b3 , z = z(x, y) be an admissible\nl\nfunction. Let P (z, x, y) =\na\u03b1,\u03b2 (z)(x \u2212 z)\u03b1 (x \u2212 y)\u03b2 , |\u03b1| \u2264 l, \u03b2 \u2264\n\u221e\nN\n3l, a\u03b1,\u03b2 \u2208 Cb (R ), be the functions provided by the Dyson-Taylor\ncommutator method explained in the second half of this Introduction.\nDefine for each integer 0 \u2264 l \u2264 \u03bc,\n[\u03bc,z]\nGt (x, y)\n\n\u2212N/2\n\n:= t\n\n\u03bc\nX\n\ntl/2 Pl ( z, z +\n\nl=0\n\nx\u2212z\ny\u2212z\nx\u2212y\n, z + 1/2 )G(z; 1/2 ),\n1/2\nt\nt\nt\n[\u03bc,z]\n\nwhere z = z(x, y). Define the error term Et\nin the approximation of\nthe Green's function by:\nZ\n[\u03bc,z]\n[\u03bc,z]\ntL\ne f (x) =\nGt (x, y)f (y)dy + t(\u03bc+1)/2 Et f (x).\nRN\n\nThen, for any f \u2208 Wam,p (RN ), a \u2208 R, m \u2265 0, 1 < p < \u221e, we have\n(1.7)\n\n[\u03bc,z]\n\nkEt\n\nf kWam+k,p \u2264 Ct\u2212k/2 kf kWam,p ,\n\nfor any t \u2208 [0, T ], 0 < T < \u221e, k \u2208 Z+ , with C independent of\nt \u2208 [0, T ].\n[\u03bc,z]\n\nThe function Gt (x, y) will be called the \u03bcth-order approximation\nkernel for the solution operator etL .\nSee Subsection 1.1 at the end of this introduction for a more detailed\n[\u03bc,z]\ndescription of how the approximation kernel Gt (x, y) is obtained. In\nSection 4 we give an explicit iterative construction of the functions Pl .\nThe main interest is, of course, in the derivation of the approximation\nkernel. However, without good error estimates, this kernel will not be\nof great use in practice.\nFor the particular choice z(x, y) = x, we have checked that the first\nfew polynomials pj (x, x \u2212 y) := Pj (x, x, y) coincide with the ones in\nthe expansion (1.5) above (see [50, Chapter 7, Section 13]). Our result\nis more general, however. We discuss in [18] different choices of the\nadditional function z = z(x, y) in the framework of the usual BlackScholes equation. It turns out that the choice z = x is not always\nthe most appropriate. In fact, for the Black-Scholes equation and \u03bc =\n5\n\n\f\u221a\n0, the choice z = xy can lead to a better approximation, whereas,\nsurprisingly, the choice z = (x+y)/2 yields worse numerical results than\nsimply choosing z = x. This addional accuracy obtained for a suitable\nchoice of z(x, y) 6= x and in view also of the mid-point quadrature\nrule (which leads to a higher order of convergence) justifies the extra\ngenerality of including arbitrary admissible z in our method.\nA localization procedure as in [41] will allow us to pass from operators on RN to operators on manifolds M of bounded geometry (again\nfollowing [17] and [41]). More precisely, our results will extend to opPN\nP\na\n\u2202\n\u2202\n+\nerators of the form L = N\nij\ni\nj\nij bi \u2202i + c, defined on a subset\nij\nN\n\u03a9 of R such that the coefficientsP\nare bounded in normal coordinates\nN ij\nwith respect to the metric g =\nij a dxi dxj , assumed to be complete of bounded geometry on \u03a9. Here the matrix [aij ] is the inverse\nof the matrix A, following the usual convention. Such metrics arise\nnaturally when resolving boundary singularities. (see [43] for a systematic treatment of heat calculus on manifolds with boundary). We\nrefer to [2, 17, 35, 53] for recent papers dealing with partial differential equations on manifolds with metrics of this form. In particular,\nwe can deal with certain operators having polynomial coefficients such\nas those arising in probability and its applications, for example in the\nBlack-Scholes option pricing equation [9]\n(1.8)\n\nLu(x) = \u03c3x2 \u2202x2 u(x)/2 + r(x\u2202x u(x) \u2212 u(x)),\n\nwhere in this context t is the time to option expiry. Our results also\napply to differential operators arising in stochastic volatility models\n(c.f. [3, 6, 25, 27, 31, 39, 40]). On the other hand, our results apply to\noperators of the form x2\u03b2 \u2202x2 , 0 < \u03b2 < 1 only locally. A good framework\nfor obtaining differential operators with unbounded coefficients that\nsatisfy our assumptions is that of Lie manifolds [2]. This point will be\ndiscussed in detail in [18]. Explicit calculations and concrete, practical\napplications of our method will be given in [19, 20].\nIn addition, our methods generalize to operators with time-depdendent\ncoefficients, satisfying certain conditions. This extension is addressed\nin a forthcoming paper [21].\nWe conclude this first part of the introduction with an outline of\nthe paper. In Section 2, we define the weighted and regular Sobolev\nspaces of initial data for the parabolic equation and introduce the class\nof operators L under study. We also briefly discuss mapping properties\nof the semigroup generated by L and use them to justify the Dyson (or\ntime-ordered) perturbation expansion of etL . In Section 3, we exploit\nlocal in space and time dilations of the Green's function together with a\n6\n\n\fcertain Taylor expansion of the operator L\u221ato rewrite the perturbation\nexpansion as a formal power series in s = t. In Section 4, we employ\ncommutator estimates to derive computable formulas for each term in\nthe expansion. This leads to the Dyson-Taylor commutator method to\ndetermine the functions Pl used in Theorem 1.1.\nFinally, in Section 5, we rigorously justify our expansion and derive\nerror bounds in time by means of pseudodifferential calculus.\nAcknowledgments We thank Andrew Lesniewski and Michael Taylor\nfor sending us their papers and for useful discussions. We also thank\nRichard Melrose for carefully reading our paper and for pointing out a\npossible missunderstanding in an earlier version of this paper.\n1.1. The approximate Green function. We close this Introduction\nby describing in more detail the Dyson-Taylor commutator methodused\n[n,z]\nto define approximation kernel Gt . Given an operator T with smooth\nkernel, we denote its kernel by T (x, y), as customary.\nWe consider\nPNa uniformly strongly\nPN elliptic differential operator L\u221eof the\nform L := i,j=1 aij \u2202i \u2202j + k=1 bk \u2202k + c, where aij , bk , c \u2208 Cb (RN )\nare real valued.\nGiven a fixedPpoint z \u2208 RN and s > 0, we define\nP\nN\nN\ns,z\ns,z\n2 s,z\nLs,z :=\ni,j=1 aij (x)\u2202i \u2202j + s\ni=1 bi (x)\u2202i + s c (x), where for a\ngeneric function f we set f s,z (x) = f (z + s(x \u2212 z)). Hence, z acts\nas a fixed dilation center. We then Taylor expand this operator in s\naround 0 to order n:\nn\nn+1\nX\nX\ns,z\ns,z\nm z\n(1.9)\nL =\ns Lm + Vn+1 =\nsm Lzm ,\nm=0\n\nm=0\n\nLzj ,\n\nwhere\n0 \u2264 j \u2264 n, are differential operators with polynomial coefficients that do not depend on s, whereas Lzn+1 has smooth coefficients\nthat, however, do depend on s (although this dependence is not shown\ns,z\nin the notation). Hence, Vn+1\n= sn+1 Lzn+1 is the remainder of the\nTaylor expansion. The order n will be chosen later. In particular, we\nobserve that\nX\n(1.10)\nLz0 =\naij (z)\u2202i \u2202j .\ni,j\n\nFor any fixed, positive integers k \u2264 n + 1 and l, we shall denote\nby Ak,l P\nthe set of multi-indexes \u03b1 = (\u03b11 , \u03b12 , . . . , \u03b1k ) \u2208 Nk , such that\n|\u03b1| :=\n\u03b1j = l. (Hence, k \u2264 l.) Then, for each multi-index \u03b1 =\n(\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1k ) \u2208 Ak,l , k \u2264 n, we introduce\nZ\nz\nz\nz\n(1.11)\n\u039b\u03b1,z :=\ne\u03c40 L0 Lz\u03b11 e\u03c41 L0 Lz\u03b12 * * * Lz\u03b1k e\u03c4k L0 d\u03c4.\n\u03a3k\n\n7\n\n\fObserve that k, l are unique given \u03b1.\nThe main point is that the operators \u039b\u03b1 can be computed explicitly\nas follows. Let us denote by D(a, b) the vector space of all differentiations of polynomial degree at most a and order at most b. (By\npolynomial degree of a differentiation we mean the highest power of the\npolynomials appearing as coefficients.) Then, for any L0 \u2208 D(0, 2)\nthat is uniformly strongly elliptic and for any Lm \u2208 D(m, 2), we\nhave a differential operator Pm (L0 , Lm ; \u03b8, x, \u2202) given by the formula\ne\u03b8L0 Lm = Pm (L0 , Lm ; \u03b8, x, \u2202)e\u03b8L0 , where \u03b8 > 0 (see Lemma 4.5). Let\n\u03a3k be the unit k-dimensional simplex. Next, for\nR any\nQk given multi-index\n\u03b1 \u2208 Ak,l with k \u2264 n, we define P\u03b1 (x, z, \u2202) := \u03a3k i=1 P\u03b1i (Lz0 , Lz\u03b1i ; 1 \u2212\n\u03c3i , x, \u2202)d\u03c3. Then\nz\n\n\u039b\u03b1,z = P\u03b1 (x, z, \u2202x )eL0 ,\n\n(1.12)\n\nwhere the product is the composition of operators and P\u03b1 is a differential operator of order 2k + l in x and polynomial degree \u2264 l in (x \u2212 z)\n(see Lemma 4.6).\nSince z is arbitrary, but fixed at this stage, if Lz0 is the operator in\nz\n(1.10) then eL0 (x, y) can be explicitly calculated and it agrees with the\nfunction G(z, x \u2212 y) introduced in equation (1.6). Therefore, it can be\neasily seen from (1.12), that\n\u039b\u03b1,z (x, y) = Pl (z, x, y)G(z; x \u2212 y),\nP\nfor some Pl (z, x, y) =\na\u03b1,\u03b2 (z)(x \u2212 z)\u03b1 (x \u2212 y)\u03b2 , |\u03b1| \u2264 l, \u03b2 \u2264 3l,\n\u221e\nN\na\u03b1,\u03b2 \u2208 Cb (R ). In particular, all \u039b\u03b1,z are operators with smooth\nkernels, thus denoted \u039b\u03b1,z (x, y).\nWe will show that etL as well is an operator with smooth kernels,\nhenceforth denoted GtL (x, y).\nLet us fix for the time being a smooth function z : RN \u00d7 RN \u2192 RN\nwhose properties will be made precise below. (Two typical examples are\nz(x, y) = (x+y)/2 and z(x, y) = x, which suffice in many applications.)\nOur approximation will be obtained by combining Lemma 3.2 with\nthe perturbative estimate of Equation (3.18) at some point z = z(x, y)\nusing the dilation with center z(x, y) and denoting s2 = t. Then, for\nany \u03bc \u2265 n, we define\n[\u03bc,z]\n\n(1.13) Gt\n\nz\n\n(x, y) := s\u2212N eL0 (z + s\u22121 (x \u2212 z), z + s\u22121 (y \u2212 z))\n+\n\n\u03bc\nl\nX\nX\nX\n\nl=1 k=1 \u03b1\u2208Ak,l\n\nsl \u039b\u03b1,z (z + s\u22121 (x \u2212 z), z + s\u22121 (y \u2212 z)).\n8\n\n\f[\u03bc,z]\n\nThe operator L is not shown explicitly in the notation Gt (x, y), al[\u03bc,z]\nthough Gt (x, y) does depend on L. This is not likely to cause any\nconfusion, since L is usually fixed in our discussions.\nThe justification of the above definition for the approximation is that\na Dyson series expansion of order n + 1 gives us\nz\n\n(1.14) Gt (x, y) := s\u2212N eL0 (z + s\u22121 (x \u2212 z), z + s\u22121 (y \u2212 z))\n(n+1)2 max{l,n+1}\n\n+\n\nX\nl=1\n\nX\n\nX\n\n\u03b1\u2208Ak,l\n\nk=1\n\nsl \u039b\u03b1,z (z + s\u22121 (x \u2212 z), z + s\u22121 (y \u2212 z)),\n\nwhere for k = n + 1 and \u03b1 = (\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1k ) \u2208 Ak,l , we introduce\nZ\nz\ns,z\nz\n(1.15)\n\u039b\u03b1,z :=\ne\u03c40 L0 Lz\u03b11 e\u03c41 L0 Lz\u03b12 * * * Lz\u03b1k e\u03c4k L d\u03c4.\n\u03a3k\n\nThe difference between equations (1.13) and (1.14) is that the sum in\nthe first equation contains exactly the terms with sl , l \u2264 n, from the\nsecond equation. The difference between equations (1.11) and (1.15)\nis in the last exponential. Note that \u039b\u03b1,z does not depend on s if l =\n|\u03b1| \u2264 n, but it may depend on s otherwise. In any case, all the terms\n\u039b\u03b1,z that depend on s will be included in the error term. All terms \u039b\u03b1,z\nwith \u03bc < |\u03b1| \u2264 n, which do not depend on s, will also be included in\nthe error. We remark that the error term is never computed explicitly,\nas only the \u03bcth order approximation kernel is needed. Therefore, while\n\u03bc will usually be small in applications, we can take n as large as needed\nto justify the error bounds of Theorem 1.1. In Section 5, we will show\nthat n > \u03bc + N \u2212 1 suffices.\n2. Preliminaries\nWe begin by discussing in more details the class of second-order\noperators L of the form (1.1) that are the focus of our work. Below we\nset\n(2.1)\n\nCb\u221e (RN ) := {f : RN \u2192 C, \u2202 \u03b1 f bounded for all \u03b1 }.\n\nDefinition 2.1. We shall denote by L the set of differential operators\nL of the form\n(2.2)\n\nL :=\n\nN\nX\n\naij \u2202i \u2202j +\n\ni,j=1\n\nN\nX\n\nbk \u2202k + c,\n\nk=1\n\nwhere aij , bk , c \u2208 Cb\u221e (RN ) are real valued. We shall denote by L\u03b3\nthe subset of operators L \u2208 L satisfying the uniform strong ellipticity\nestimate (1.2) with the ellipticity constant \u03b3. We let A = [aij ] and\n9\n\n\fassume additionally that A is symmetric, which can be achieved simply\nby replacing A with its symmetric part, since this does not change our\ndifferential operator.\nThe above definition can be extended to operators on manifolds of\nbounded geometry M (see [17, 41, 47]). For example, when M = RN\nwith the Euclidean metric, the class L considered in [41] coincides with\nthe class L considered in this paper.\n2\nN\nR In what follows, we denote the inner product 2on1/2L (R ) by (u, v) =\nu(x)v(x)dx. Let us denote h\u03bei := (1 + |\u03be| )\nand let \u00fb be the\nRN\nFourier Transform of u. We also recall the definition of and some basic\nfacts about Lp -based Sobolev spaces W r,p (RN ) . For 1 < p < \u221e, r \u2208 R:\n(2.3) W r,p (RN ) := {u : RN \u2192 C , h\u03beir \u00fb \u2208 Lp (RN )}\nIf r \u2208 Z+ ,\n\n= W r,p (RN ) := {u : RN \u2192 C , (1 \u2212 \u2206)r/2 u \u2208 Lp (RN )},\n\nW r,p(RN ) = {u : RN \u2192 C, \u2202 \u03b1 u \u2208 Lp (RN ), |\u03b1| \u2264 r}.\n\nSince the dimension N is fixed throughout the paper, we will usually\nwrite W r,p for W r,p(RN ). When 1 < p < \u221e, the dual of W r,p is the\n\u2032\nSobolev space W \u2212r,p with 1/p + 1/p\u2032 = 1.\nWe are interested in considering the initial value problem (1.3) in the\nlargest-possible space of initial data f that includes the typical initial\nconditions that arise in applications and where uniqueness holds. We\ntherefore introduce exponentially weighted Sobolev spaces. Given a\nfixed point y \u2208 RN , we set hxiw := hx \u2212 wi = (1 + |x \u2212 w|2)1/2 and\nm,p\ndefine Wa,w\n(RN ) for m \u2208 Z+ , a \u2208 R, 1 < p < \u221e, by\nr,p\n(2.4) Wa,w\n(RN ) := e\u2212ahxiw W r,p(RN )\n\u0001\n= {u : RN \u2192 C, \u2202x\u03b1 eahxiw u(*) , \u2208 Lp (RN ), |\u03b1| \u2264 r},\n\nwith norm\n\nahxiw\nkukpWa,w\nukpW m,p =\nm,p := ke\n\nX\n\n|\u03b1|\u2264m\n\nif r \u2208 Z+ ,\n\n\u0001\nk\u2202\u03be\u03b1 eahxiw u(x) kpLp .\n\nWhen it is clear from the context, we may drop the subscript w from the\nm,p\nabove notation. We observe that W0m,p = W0,w\n= W m,p . The spaces\n\u2212r,p\u2032\nr,p\nare naturally duals to each other if 1/p + 1/p\u2032 = 1.\nWa,w\nand W\u2212a,w\nA crucial observation is that, for any L \u2208 L\u03b3 and any a \u2208 R, the\noperators La := eahxiw Le\u2212ahxiw are also in L\u03b3 . They moreover define\na bounded family in L\u03b3 if a is in a bounded set, while w is arbitrary.\nSince proving a result for L acting between weighted Sobolev spaces\n10\n\n\fs,p\nWa,w\nis the same as proving the corresponding result for L1 acting\ns,p\nbetween the Sobolev spaces W s,p = W0,w\n, we may assume that a = 0\ns+2,p\ns,p\nand w is arbitrary. In particular, L : Wa,y\n\u2192 Wa,w\nis well defined\nand continuous for any a and w, since this is true for a = 0.\nIn fact, it will be crucial for us to establish mapping properties that\nare independent of w. This will be the case in all estimates below, unless\nstated otherwise. One of the most important example is provided by\nm,p\nCorollary 3.9. Moreover, the spaces Wa,w\ndo not depend on the choice\nof the point y (although their norm obviously does). Because of this\nobservation, we shall often omit the point w from the notation, when\nthis does not affect the clarity of the presentation.\nWe begin by recalling some properties of L and the associated solution operator etL to the initial value problem (1.3).\n\n2.1. Mapping properties. Given a Banach X and an interval I of the\nreal line, we shall denote by C(I, X) the space of continuous functions\nu : I \u2192 X. By C k (I, X) we shall denote the space of functions u \u2208\nC(I, X) such that u(j) \u2208 C(I, X) for all 0 \u2264 j \u2264 k. We assume that\nX \u2282 L1loc (RN ), and that L is a closed unbounded operator on X with\ndomain D(L) \u2282 X.\nLet g \u2208 C([0, \u221e), X). By a classical solution in X of (1.3) we mean\na function\n(2.5)\n\nu \u2208 C([0, \u221e), X) \u2229 C 1 ((0, \u221e), X) \u2229 C((0, \u221e), D(L)),\n\nsuch that \u2202t u(t) = Lu(t) + g(t) in X for all t > 0 and u(0) = f in X.\n(The domain of L is given the graph norm |||u||| := kuk + kLuk, which\nmakes D(L) a complete normed space, since we have assumed that L\nis closed and X is complete.) In particular, u(0) = f must belong to\nthe closure of D(L) in X. In the case of interest here, if X = Was,p,\nthen D(L) = Was+2,p , which is dense in X.\nIn view of Duhamel's formula (which will be justified below), we\ncan assume g = 0 in Equation (1.3). We shall take our Banach space\nwhere the solution is defined to be X = Lpa for some arbitrary, but\nfixed, p \u2208 (1, \u221e) and a \u2265 0. Then Equation (1.3) becomes\n(\n\u2202t u(t) \u2212 Lu(t) = 0\nin Lpa (RN ),\n(2.6)\nu(0) = f\nf \u2208 Lpa (RN ).\nLet us notice that if f \u2208 C \u221e (RN ) also, then we recover Equation (1.3).\nThe growth condition u(t) \u2208 Lpa is needed, however, in order to insure\nuniqueness.\nA family of (bounded) linear operators U(t) on X, t \u2265 0, will be\ncalled a C 0 or strongly continuous semigroups of operators if U(t) forms\n11\n\n\fa semigroup in t and U(t)u \u2192 u in X as t \u2192 0+. This last property\nshows that the function [0, \u221e) \u220b t \u2192 U(t)f \u2208 X is continuous for any\nf \u2208 X.\nWe shall need the following standard result. Recall the subset L\u03b3 \u2282\nL introduced in Definition 2.1.\nLemma 2.2. (i) Let L \u2208 L\u03b3 , then there exists a constant C > 0 such\nthat\n\u03b3(\u2207u, \u2207u) \u2212 C(u, u) \u2264 \u2212(Lu, u) \u2264 C(\u2207u, \u2207u) + C(u, u).\n(ii) The norm |||v|||2m := kukLp + kLm ukLp is equivalent to the norm\nk * kW 2m,p on W 2m,p (RN ), for any m \u2208 Z+ and 1 < p < \u221e.\nProof. (Sketch.) (i) follows from a direct calculation. See [47], [51]or\n[41] for (ii).\n\u0003\nIt follows from this lemma that L : W 2,p \u2192 Lp is a closed, densely\ndefined unbounded operator on Lp . This technical fact is important\nbecause it is often needed for the general results that we will use below.\nFor the sake of clarity and completeness, we include here a quick review and some proofs of the main properties of the semigroup generated\nby L. Our proofs also serve the purpose of justifying the perturbative\nexpansion described in Section 2.2, which is discussed extensively in\nthe literature, but usually not in the setting that we need. Further\ndetails can be found in [38, 34, 45]. Below p \u2208 (1, \u221e) and \u03b3 > 0 will\nbe arbitrary but fixed, and the constants appearing in the estimates\ndepend on p and \u03b3, but not on L \u2208 L\u03b3 .\nProposition 2.3. Let a \u2208 R, 1 < p < \u221e, and L \u2208 L\u03b3 .\n\n(i) For each f \u2208 Wa2,p , the problem (1.3) has a unique classical solution\nu \u2208 C([0, \u221e), Lpa ) \u2229 C 1 ((0, \u221e), Lpa) \u2229 C((0, \u221e), Wa2,p).\n\n(ii) Let etL f := u(t), then we have etL War,p \u2282 War,p and, moreover,\nketL f kWar,p \u2264 Ce\u03c9t kf kWar,p , for a constant C independent of r, a,\nand L \u2208 L\u03b3 in bounded sets..\nProof. We can assume a = 0, as explained above. Lemma 2.2 (i) gives\nthat L satisfies the assumptions of the Hille-Yosida theorem [23, 38, 45],\nand hence etL is defined, is a C 0 semigroup, and u(t) := etL f is indeed\na classical solution. This proves (i).\nIt also follows from standard properties of C 0 -semigroups in Banach\nspaces that ketL f kLp \u2264 Ce\u03c9t kf kLp for some constants C > 0 and \u03c9 \u2208 R\n12\n\n\findependent of L \u2208 L\u03b3 . To prove (ii), we then notice that\n(2.7) ketL f kW 2m,p \u2264 C|||etL f |||2m,p = C ketL f kLp + kLm etL f kLp\n\u0001\n\u0001\n= C ketL f kLp + ketL Lm f kLp \u2264 Ce\u03c9t kf kLp + kLm f kLp\n\n\u0001\n\n= Ce\u03c9t |||f |||2m \u2264 Ce\u03c9t kf kW 2m,p ,\n\nwith constants depending on m, p, and L, but not on t. Though L\nmay not be self-adjoint, the adjoint L\u2217 is an operator of the same type,\nin the sense that L\u2217 \u2208 L\u03b3 . Hence the estimate above holds for L\u2217 ,\nwith possibly different constants. We can then extend Equation (2.7)\n\u2032\nto W \u22122m,p , m \u2208 Z+ , by duality and to any W r,p by interpolation (see\nfor example [8, 52] for results on interpolation). This completes the\nproof.\n\u0003\nFrom now on we shall denote by etL the C 0 -semigroup generated by L\non Lpa = eahxiz Lp (RN ), with p and a determined by the context (usually\narbitrary, but fixed).\nWe recall that for f \u2208 D(L), the map t \u2192 etL f is in C 1 ([0, \u221e), X)\nand \u2202t etL f = etL Lf = LetL f . For any two normed spaces X and Y , we\ndenote by B(X, Y ) the normed space of continuous, linear operators\nT : X \u2192 Y with norm kT kX\u2192Y . When X = Y , we shall also write\nkT kX := kT kX\u2192X and B(X) := B(X, X). The identity operator of any\nspace will be denoted by 1.\nLemma 2.4. Let L \u2208 L\u03b3 . We have ketL \u2212 1kWas+2,p \u2192Was,p \u2264 Ct, for\nany t \u2208 (0, 1]. In particular, [0, \u221e) \u220b t \u2192 etL \u2208 B(Was+2,p , Was,p) is\ncontinuous.\nRt\nProof. We have etL f \u2212 f = 0 esL Lf ds for any f \u2208 Wa2,p , by standard\nproperties of C 0 -semigroups. Lemma 2.3 (ii) then gives\nZ t\ntL\nke f \u2212 f kWas,p \u2264\nkesL kWas,p kLf kWas,p ds \u2264 Cte\u03c9t kf kWas+2,p ,\n0\n\nwhich proves the first part of the result.\nLet now t1 \u2265 t2 . Then\nket1 L \u2212 et2 L kWas+2,p \u2192Was,p \u2264 ke(t1 \u2212t2 )L \u2212 1kWas+2,p \u2192Was,p ket2 L kWas,p .\nThis completes the second part of the proof.\n\n\u0003\n\nRemark 2.5. Let \u03b4 \u2208 (0, 2]. Then an interpolation argument gives\nketL \u2212 1kWas+\u03b4,p \u2192Was,p \u2264 Ct\u03b4/2 , for any t \u2208 (0, 1]. Hence the function\n[0, \u221e) \u220b t \u2192 etL \u2208 B(Was+\u03b4,p , Was,p) is also continuous.\n13\n\n\fWe discuss smoothing properties of etL , it is convenient to first assume L\u2217 = L, that is that L is self-adjoint. This will require us to set\na = 0 in our weighted Sobolev spaces Was,p = Was,p (RN ). This assumption will be removed later on. The following result is known, we sketch\na proof for completeness. (See for example [45] and [41] in the more\ngeneral case of manifolds with bounded geometry.)\nCorollary 2.6. Let t > 0. There exist constants Cr,s > 0 such that,\nfor any L \u2208 L\u03b3 with L = L\u2217 :\n(i) ketL f kW r,p (RN ) \u2264 Cr,s t(s\u2212r)/2 kf kW s,p (RN ) , r \u2265 s real.\n(ii) There exists GtL (x, y) \u2208 C \u221e ((0, \u221e) \u00d7 RN \u00d7 RN ) such that\nZ\ntL\ne f (x) =\n(2.8)\nGtL (x, y)f (y)dy.\nRN\n\nProof. The part (i) can be proved using resolvent estimates and a\nscaling-in-time argument. Part (ii) folllows from the Schwartz kernel theorem (see for example [50, Chapter 7]), since from (i) etL maps\ncompactly supported distributions in E \u2032(RN ) to smooth functions in\nC \u221e (RN ). In fact, if we denote by <, > the duality pairing between C \u221e\nand E \u2032 , we explicitly have:\n(2.9)\n\nGtL (x, y) =< \u03b4x , etL \u03b4y >,\n\nwhere \u03b4z , z \u2208 RN , represents the Dirac delta distributions supported\nat z (i.e., \u03b4z (f ) = f (z)).\n\u0003\nWe now proceed to eliminate the assumption that L\u2217 = L in the\nabove result. First, let us notice that if L, L0 \u2208 L\u03b3 , and if we denote\nV = L \u2212 L0 and g(t, x) = V u(x, t), then (1.3) becomes\n(\n\u2202t u \u2212 L0 u = g\nin (0, \u221e) \u00d7 RN ,\n(2.10)\nu(0, x) = f (x)\non {0} \u00d7 RN .\nIt is well-know that applying Duhamel's formula, gives a Volterra integral equation of the first kind for u. If L = L\u22170 , the solution of the\nintegral equation is a classical solution of (2.10). in fact, it is enough\nthat etL0 generates an analytic semigroup (see [45, Theorem 2.4, page\n107]). For simplicity, we want to avoid using the theory of analytic\nsemigroups, and rather use instead Corrolary 2.6.\nLemma 2.7. Let us assume that g \u2208 C([0, \u221e), Lp ). Then the classical\nLp -solution of the problem (2.10) is given by\nZ t\ntL0\n(2.11)\nu(t) = e f +\ne(t\u2212\u03c4 )L0 g(\u03c4 )d\u03c4.\n0\n\n14\n\n\fAssume that L \u2208 L\u03b3 , and let L0 = (L\u2217 + L)/2. Then, the classical\nLp -solution u(t) =: etL f to the problem (2.6) is given by:\nZ t\ntL\ntL0\n(2.12)\ne f =e f+\ne(t\u2212\u03c4 )L0 (L \u2212 L0 )e\u03c4 L f d\u03c4,\n0\n\np\n\nfor any initial data f \u2208 L , 1 < p < \u221e.\n\nProof. Let us notice that u is defined since e(t\u2212\u03c4 )L0 g(\u03c4 ) is continuous\nin \u03c4 . For f \u2208 W 2,p and g \u2208 C([0, \u221e), W 2,p), the function u is also\ndifferentiable and\nZ t\n\u2032\ntL0\nu (t) = L0 e f +\nL0 e(t\u2212\u03c4 )L0 g(\u03c4 )d\u03c4 + g(t) = L0 u(t) + g(t).\n0\n\n2,p\n\nSince C([0, \u221e), W ) is dense in C([0, \u221e), Lp ) (for the topology of uniform convergence on compacta), this proves the first part.\nTo prove the second part, let us chose f \u2208 W 1,p , then the function\n[0, \u221e) \u220b \u03c4 \u2192 (L \u2212 L0 )e\u03c4 L f = g(\u03c4 ) \u2208 Lp is continuous (since L \u2212 L0 is\nin L and has order at most one), and hence we can apply the first part\nto obtain the formula (2.12).\nIn general, using Proposition 2.3, part (ii), and the fact that V \u2208 L\nand has order at most one, we obtain by Corollary 2.6, part (i) that\nke(t\u2212\u03c4 )L0 (L \u2212 L0 )e\u03c4 L f kLp \u2264 Ct\u22121/2 kf kLp , so that the integral on the\nright hand side of (2.12) is defined and continuous in f \u2208 Lp . Since\nthe left hand side of (2.12) is also continuous in f \u2208 Lp , the result then\nfollows by continuity and by density of W 1,p in Lp .\n\u0003\nR t (t\u2212\u03c4 )L\n0\nRemark 2.8. The integral 0 e\n(L \u2212 L0 )e\u03c4 L f d\u03c4 is defined either\nas a Bochner integral (for the Rdefinition of the Bochner integral see\nt\u2212\u01eb\ne.g. [44]) or as the limit lim\u01eb\u05810 \u01eb e(t\u2212\u03c4 )L0 (L \u2212 L0 )e\u03c4 L f d\u03c4 of Riemann\nintegral for continuous functions.\nWe now extend Corollary 2.6 to non self-adjoint operators L and to\nthe exponentially weighted spaces Was,p.\n\nProposition 2.9. Let L \u2208 L\u03b3 arbitrary. We have etL Was,p \u2282 War,p for\nall r, s, a \u2208 R, 1 < p < \u221e, and t > 0. Let r \u2265 s, then\nku(t)kWar,p \u2264 Ct(s\u2212r)/2 kf kWas,p ,\n\nt \u2208 (0, 1].\n\nThe constant C above is independent r, s, a, p, and L, as long as they\nbelong to bounded sets.\nWe recall that Was,p is independent of the choice of the point z (see\nEquation (2.4)). The constant C in the above proposition is also independent of z \u2208 RN since the family eahxiz Le\u2212ahxiz is uniformly bounded\nin L\u03b3 for z \u2208 RN and a in a bounded set. For this reason, we shall\nsometimes drop the index z from the notation hxiz .\n15\n\n\fProof. As discussed above, we may assume that a = 0. Also, note that\nwe already know that etL Was,p \u2282 War,p for all r \u2264 s, so let us concentrate\non the non-trivial case r \u2265 s. Let L0 := (L + L\u2217 )/2 and V = L \u2212 L0 .\nThen V \u2208 L is a differential operator of order at most one. By Lemma\n2.7,\nZ t\ntL\ntL0\ne =e +\ne(t\u2212\u03c4 )L0 V e\u03c4 L d\u03c4.\n0\n\nLet us assume also that s \u2264 r < s + 1. Using also Proposition 2.3,\npart ii, we obtain that the norm ketL kW s,p \u2192W r,p of etL as linear map\nW s,p \u2192 W r,p can be bounded as\nketL kW s,p \u2192W r,p \u2264 ketL0 kW s,p \u2192W r,p\nZ t\n+\nke(t\u2212\u03c4 )L0 kW s\u22121,p \u2192W r,p kV kW s,p \u2192W s\u22121,p ke\u03c4 L1 kW s,p d\u03c4\n0\nZ t\n\u0010\n\u0011\n(s\u2212r)/2\n\u2264C t\n+ (t\u2212\u03c4 )(s\u22121\u2212r)/2 d\u03c4 = Ct(s\u2212r)/2 (1+t1/2 ) \u2264 Ct(r\u2212s)/2 ,\n0\n\nwhere in the last inequality we have used that 0 < t \u2264 1, and where\nC > 0 is a generic constant, different at each appearance. The general\ncase follows from this one as follows. Let \u03b4 = (r \u2212 s)/m, for m >\nr \u2212 s. We first notice that ketL/m kW s+(j\u22121)\u03b4,p \u2192W s+j\u03b4,p \u2264 C(t/m)(s\u2212r)/(2m)\nby the result\u0001 that we have just proved, since \u03b4 < 1. We then write\nm\netL = etL/m\nand we use the submultiplicative property of the norm\n\u0003\nto obtain ketL kW s,p \u2192W r,p \u2264 C(t/m)m(s\u2212r)/(2m) = C \u2032 t(s\u2212r)/2 .\nIn particular, Proposition 2.9 gives the existence of the Green's function GtL (x, y) for any L \u2208 L\u03b3 , defined again via formula (2.9). In particular for t > 0, this kernel is a smooth function of x and y. We will\nalso use the notation GtL (x, y) = etL (x, y). The following corollary is a\nconsequence of Proposition 2.9.\nCorollary 2.10. Let L \u2208 L\u03b3 and s, r \u2208 R be arbitrary. We then have\nthat the map\n(0, \u221e) \u220b t \u2192 etL \u2208 B(Was,p , War,p )\nis infinitely many times differentiable.\n\nProof. We have \u2202tk etL = etL Lk , so it is enough to show that the map\n(0, \u221e) \u220b t \u2192 etL \u2208 B(Was\u2212k,p , War,p) is continuous. Now, for each\n\u03b4 > 0, let t \u2265 \u03b4 > 0. Then e\u03b4L maps Was\u2212k,p to War+2,p continuously, by\nProposition 2.9. Writing etL = e(t\u2212\u03b4)L e\u03b4L and using the continuity of\n[\u03b4, \u221e) \u220b t \u2192 e(t\u2212\u03b4)L \u2208 B(War+2,p , War,p), by Lemma 2.4, we obtain the\nresult.\n\u0003\n16\n\n\fSee [13, 11, 48] for more continuity properties of the semigroups generated by second order differential operators (Schr\u00f6dinger semigroups).\nLet us notice for further reference that for constant coefficient operators, the Green's function can be determined explicitly.\nRemark 2.11.

Perturbative expansion. The purpose of this section is to obtain a time-ordered perturbative expansion of etL , L \u2208 L\u03b3 , in terms\nof etL0 for a fixed element L0 \u2208 L\u03b3 . Later, L0 will be obtained by\nfreezing the highest-order coefficients of L at a given point z and dropping the lower-order terms. This expansion is the well-known Dyson\nseries [28, 32, 34]. Here, we concentrate on justifying this expansion in\nour setting and in obtaining global error estimates in weighted Sobolev\nspaces.\nFor each k \u2208 Z+ , we denote by\nX\n\u03a3k := {\u03c4 = (\u03c40 , \u03c41 , . . . , \u03c4k ) \u2208 Rk+1 , \u03c4j \u2265 0,\n\u03c4j = 1}\n\u2243 {\u03c3 = (\u03c31 , . . . , \u03c3k ) \u2208 Rk , 1 \u2265 \u03c31 \u2265 \u03c32 \u2265 . . . \u03c3k\u22121 \u2265 \u03c3k \u2265 0}\n\nthe standard unit simplex of dimension k.

It is enough to prove that \u03a6 is continuous on each of the sets\nVj := {\u03c4j > 1/(k + 2)}, j = 0, . . . , k, since they cover \u03a3k .

Local dilations and perturbative expansions\nIn this section, we tackle the task of deriving an algorithmically computable approximation to etL . We exploit the perturbative expansion\n(2.15) with L0 the operator obtained by freezing the highest-order coefficents of L at a given, but arbitrary, point z \u2208 RN , and dropping the\nlower-order terms (see (3.11a) below). Then, we approximate L \u2212 L0\nby an appropriate Taylor expansion, so that each of the terms in (2.15)\n19\n\n\fexcept the last one can be explicitly computed using commutator formulas, as discussed in Section 4. Recall that the sets of second order\ndifferential operators L\u03b3 \u2282 L were introduced in Definition 2.1.\nFirst, using a suitable rescaling in space and time, we replace the\nproblem of determining an asymptotic expansion of the kernel\nGtL (x, y) := etL (x, y)\nof etL by the problem of determining an asymptotic expansion of the\ns,z\ns,z\ns,z\nkernel G1L (x, y) = eL (x, y)\nof eL for a suitable family of operators\n\u221a\nLs,z parameterized by s = t, and by the point z \u2208 RN . The point\nz is fixed throughout this section, but it will be allowed to vary later\non as a function of x and y satisfying some conditions, for example\nz = (x + y)/2. For some results, we will set z = x. The family Ls,z\nhas limit precisely L0 as s \u2192 0. Since we will let z vary later, we shall\nsometimes write L0 = Lz0 .\nFor any s > 0, we consider the action on functions of dilating x by s\nabout z and t by s2 about 0. If f : RN \u2192 R, u : [0, \u221e) \u00d7 RN \u2192 R, we\nthen set\nf s,z (x) := f (z + s(x \u2212 z)),\n\n(3.1)\n\nus,z (t, x) := u(s2 t, z + s(x \u2212 z)),\n\n(3.2)\nand,\n(3.3)\n\nLs,z :=\n\nN\nX\n\nas,z\nij (x)\u2202i \u2202j + s\n\ni,j=1\n\nN\nX\n\n2 s,z\nbs,z\ni (x)\u2202i + s c (x).\n\ni=1\n\nWe immediately see that\n(3.4)\n\nLs,z us,z = s2 (Lu)s,z ,\n\n(\u2202t \u2212 Ls,z )us,z = s2 [(\u2202t \u2212 L)u]s,z\n\nIn particular, we have the following simple lemma, which we record for\nfurther reference.\nLemma 3.1.

Perturbative expansion of eL . Since Lemma 3.2 gives us an\nimmediate procedure for obtaining the Green function GtL (x, y) of \u2202t \u2212L\ns,z\nfrom the Green's function GtL (x, y) of \u2202t \u2212 Ls,z , we now concentrate\non obtaining a perturbative expansion for the latter.\nRecall that Lz0 = L0,z = lims\u05810 Ls,z . Let us write V1s,z := Ls,z \u2212 Lz0 .\nThen, V1s,z takes the role of V in the perturbative expansion (2.15) for\ns,z\nthe operator eL , that is:\nZ\nz\nz\nLs,z\nLz0\ne\u03c40 L0 V1s,z e\u03c41 L0 d\u03c4\ne\n= e +\n\u03a31\nZ\nz\nz\nz\ne\u03c40 L0 V1s,z e\u03c41 L0 V1s,z e\u03c42 L0 d\u03c4 + . . .\n+\n\u03a32\nZ\n(3.7)\nz\nz\nz\nz\n+\ne\u03c40 L0 V1s,z e\u03c41 L0 . . . e\u03c4d\u22121 L0 V1s,z e\u03c4d L0 d\u03c4\n\u03a3d\nZ\ns,z\nz\nz\nz\n+\ne\u03c40 L0 V1s,z e\u03c41 L0 . . . e\u03c4d L0 V1s,z e\u03c4d+1 L d\u03c4.\n\u03a3d+1\n\n21\n\n\fIn a sense to be made precise below, we have V1s = O(s). Consequently,\nif we let the iteration level d \u2192 \u221e in (2.15), we obtain a formal power\nseries in s. We will rigorously show in Section 5 using the exponentially weighted Sobolev spaces Was,p that (2.15) indeed gives rises to an\nasymptotically convergent series in s as s \u2192 0 and will derive global\nerror bounds in W s,p and Was,p for the partial sums.\nLet n \u2208 Z+ be a fixed integer and consider the Taylor expansion of\nthe operator Ls,z up to order n in s around s = 0,\nn\nX\ns,z\ns,z\n(3.8)\nL =\nsm Lzm + Vn+1\nm=0\n\nwere\n\ns,z\nVn+1\n\nis the remainder term in the expansion. Let\ns,z\nVn+1\n= sn+1 Ls,z\nn+1 .\n\nThe operators Lzm , 1 \u2264 m \u2264 n, are given by\n\u0012 m\n\u0013\n1\nd\nz\ns,z\n(3.9)\nLm :=\nL\nm! dsm\n\n,\ns=0\n\nand are independent of s, while\n(3.10)\n\nLs,z\nn+1\n\n1\n:=\n(n + 1)!\n\n\u0012\n\ndn+1 \u03b8,z\nL\nd\u03b8n+1\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\u03b8=\u03b1s\n\nfor some 0 < \u03b1 < 1, and hence it still depends on s.\nRemark 3.3. From the form of Ls,z in equation (3.3) it follows that\nthe operator Lzm , m \u2264 n, (respectively Ls,z\nn+1 ) has coefficients that are\npolynomials in x \u2212 z of degree at most m (respectively of degree n + 1).\nThe coefficients of the polynomials themselves are bounded functions\nof z. More precisely, the coefficients of the second order derivative\nterms are of degree at most m in x \u2212 z, while the coefficients of the\nfirst order derivatives term are of degree at most m\u22121 in x\u2212z, and the\ncoefficients of the zero order derivative term is of degree at most m \u2212 2\nin x \u2212 z. The coefficients of these polynomials in x \u2212 z are bounded\nfunctions of z, together will all their derivatives, a fact that will be\nexploited later.\nThe first few terms of the Taylor expansions are explicitly:\nLz0\n\n(3.11a)\n\n=\n\nN\nX\n\naij (z)\u2202i \u2202j ,\n\ni,j=1\n\n(3.11b)\n\nLz1\n\n=\n\nN\nX\n\ni,j=1\n\n((x \u2212 z) * \u2207aij (z)) \u2202i \u2202j +\n22\n\nN\nX\ni=1\n\nbi (z)\u2202i ,\n\n\fLz2\n(3.11c)\n\nN\nX\n\u0001\n1\n(x \u2212 z)T \u22072 aij (z) (x \u2212 z) \u2202i \u2202j +\n=\n2\ni,j=1\n\n+\n\nN\nX\ni=1\n\n((x \u2212 z) * \u2207bi (z))\u2202i + c(z).\n\nSince Lz0 has coefficients that are constant in x, from formula (2.14)\nwe obtain\n(x\u2212y)t (A0 )\u22121 (x\u2212y)\n1\nz\n4t\n(3.12)\netL0 = p\n,\ne\n(4\u03c0t)N det A0\n\nwhere A0 := A(z).\nFurthermore V1s := Ls,z \u2212 Lz0 can be written as\n(3.13)\n\nV1s\n\n:=\n\nn\nX\n\nsm Lzm + sn+1 Ls,z\nn+1 .\n\nm=0\n\nThis Taylor polynomial expansion can then be substituted into (3.7),\nyielding another polynomial in s. To describe each term of this polynomial and to formulate the main results in this section, we need to\nintroduce some notation. Let N := {1, 2, 3, . . .} denote the set of natural numbers (always assumed to be > 0).\nDefinition 3.4. For any integers 1 \u2264 k \u2264 d + 1 and l, we shall\ndenote by Ak,l the set of multi-indexes \u03b1 = (\u03b11 , \u03b12 , . . . , \u03b1k ) \u2208 Nk , such\nP\nS\nthat |\u03b1| :=\n\u03b1j = l. Furthermore, we denote Al := lk=1 Ak,l . For\nsymmetry, it will be convenient to set Al,k = {\u2205} if l < k, including\nwhen l \u2264 0.\nWe note that, since \u03b1i \u2265 1, the set Ak,l is empty if l < k. The\nmeaning of l is that of the corresponding power of s and the meaning\nof k is that of the iteration level in the Dyson series (3.7).\nProposition 3.5. The set Al contains 2l\u22121 elements.\nProof. For any given, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 l, the number of elements in the set\nAk,l is the number of sequences {\u03b11 , \u0001\u03b12 , ...\u03b1k } of size k which add up\nl\u22121\nto l and is, therefore, given by k\u22121\n. Consequently, the number of\n\u0001 Pl\u22121 l\u22121\u0001\nPl\nl\u22121\nelements in Al is given by k=1 k\u22121 = k=0 k = 2l\u22121.\n\u0003\nWe are now in the position to describe the expansion 3.7 more explicitly. We recall that d is the iteration level of the approximation and\nn is the order of the Taylor expansion. In the following definition, by\nabuse of notation, it will be convenient to write Lzn+1 instead of Ls,z\nn+1 ,\n23\n\n\fthat is, we shall omit s from the notation. We also recall that Ak,l \u2261 \u2205,\nif l < k. This condition will be understood.\nDefinition 3.6. For each multi-index \u03b1 = (\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1k ) \u2208 Ak,l , we let\nZ\nz\nz\nz\n(3.14)\n\u039b\u03b1,z :=\ne\u03c40 L0 Lz\u03b11 e\u03c41 L0 Lz\u03b12 * * * Lz\u03b1k e\u03c4k L0 d\u03c4,\n\u03a3k\n\nif 1 \u2264 k \u2264 d, and\n(3.15)\n\n\u039b\u03b1,z :=\n\nZ\n\nz\n\n\u03a3d+1\n\nz\n\ns,z\n\ne\u03c40 L0 Lz\u03b11 e\u03c41 L0 Lz\u03b12 * * * Lz\u03b1d+1 e\u03c4d+1 L d\u03c4.\n\nif k = d + 1. Then, we set\n\u039blz :=\n\n(3.16)\n\nX\n\n\u039b\u03b1,z ,\n\n\u03b1\u2208Al\nz\n\nwith the convention that \u039b0z = eL0 .\nWe observe that \u03b1 uniquely determines k and l, so that our notation\nis justified. Let \u03b1 = (\u03b1j ) \u2208 Ak,l . We remark that if k = n + 1 or some\n\u03b1j = n + 1 (in which case Lz\u03b1j stands in fact for Ls,z\nn+1 ), then \u039b\u03b1,z and\nl\n\u039bz depend on s, so we shall sometimes denote these terms by \u039b\u03b1,s,z\nand \u039bls,z .\nAlso, in what follows, when no confusion can arise, we will drop the\nexplicit dependence on z. However, in Section 5, z will be allowed to\nvary and we will reinstate the full notation. We also observe that each\n\u039blz or \u039bls,z is well defined as a Riemann integral by Lemma 2.12 and by\nthe following lemmas. Let us recall that hxiw = (1 + |x \u2212 w|2 )1/2 .\nLemma 3.7. The family\nz\nN\n{hxi\u2212j\nz Lj ; s \u2208 (0, 1], z \u2208 R , j = 0, . . . , n + 1}\n\ndefines a bounded subset of L.\nProof. This is an immediate consequence of Remark 3.3 if j \u2264 n and of\ndirectly estimating the remainder in the Taylor series for j = n+ 1. \u0003\nIn the following Lemma, we shall use an arbitrary center for our\nweight.\nLemma 3.8. For each given \u01eb > 0, the family\n{e\u2212\u01ebhz\u2212wi e\u2212\u01ebhxiw Lzj ; s \u2208 (0, 1], z \u2208 RN , j = 0, . . . , n + 1}\nis a bounded subset of L.\n24\n\n\fProof. Let us assume first that w = z. We need to prove that the\nfamily\n{e\u2212\u01ebhxiz Lzj ; s \u2208 (0, 1], z \u2208 RN , j = 0, . . . , n + 1}\nis bounded in L. Indeed, this follows from Lemma 3.7 and the simple\nobservation that hxijz e\u2212\u01ebhxiz \u2264 C, with C independent of z and j.\nTo obtain the statement of the theorem, we then apply the triangle inequality to the vectors (0, x), (1, z), (1, w) \u2208 R1+N to conclude\nthat hx \u2212 zi \u2212 hx \u2212 wi \u2264 |z \u2212 w| \u2264 hz \u2212 wi. This shows that\ne\u01eb(hx\u2212zi\u2212hx\u2212wi\u2212hz\u2212wi) \u2264 1. Hence the family\n{e\u01eb(hx\u2212zi\u2212hx\u2212wi\u2212hz\u2212wi) e\u2212\u01ebhxiz Lzj = e\u2212\u01ebhz\u2212wi e\u2212\u01ebhxiw Lzj },\n\ns \u2208 (0, 1], z \u2208 RN , j = 0, . . . , n + 1, is bounded in L, as claimed.\n\n\u0003\n\nLemma 2.12 together with Lemma 3.8 then give the following result.\nr,p\nCorollary 3.9. We have \u039b\u03b1,z \u2208 B(Was,p, Wa\u2212\u01eb\n), for any \u03b1 \u2208 Ak,l ,\nN\nz \u2208 R , r, s \u2208 R, 1 < p < \u221e, and \u01eb > 0. Moreover, we have that\nq,p\nr,p\nk\u039b\u03b1,z kWa,z\n\u2264 Cq,r,p,a,\u01ebek\u01ebhz\u2212wi ,\n\u2192Wa\u2212\u01eb,z\n\nfor a constant Cq,r,p,a,\u01eb that does not depend on z. In particular, each\n\u039b\u03b1,z is an operator with smooth kernel \u039b\u03b1,z (x, y).\nTherefore, we can write\n(3.17)\n\n\u039b\u03b1,z f (x) =\n\nZ\n\n\u039b\u03b1,z (x, y)f (y)dy.\nRN\n\nThe point of the above definition and results is to rewrite the perturbative expansion (partial Dyson series) in the form\nLemma 3.10. Denote M = (d + 1)(n + 1).

Since Es,z\nd,n is independent of d for d \u2265 n, we\nshall eventually restrict to d = n.\n4. Commutator calculations\nThe purpose of this section is to give an explicitly computable representation of the perturbative expansion (3.18) as\nLs,z\n\ne\n\nLz0\n\n\u223ce\n\n+\n\nn\nX\nl=1\n\nz\n\nsl P l (x, z, \u2202)eL0\n\nwhere P j (x, z, \u2202) is a differential operator with smooth coefficients that\ndepend polynomialy on x \u2212 z and s, and are bounded with all derivatives in z. Both the order of the operator as well as the degree of the\npolynomial coefficients depend on the order of the Taylor expansion n,\nwhich also equals the iteration level d. We give an explicit characterization of Pn and an iterative procedure to calculate it in Theorem 4.7.\nThe main idea is to show that each \u039b\u03b1,z in (3.14) can be written as\nan explicitly computable differential operator P\u03b1 acting on the distriz\nbution kernel of eL0 , and thus using (3.16) show that the perturbative\nexpansion (3.18) can be rewritten in this form as well. Throughout\nthis section, z is kept fixed, though arbitrary, and \u2202 will always mean\ndifferentiation with respect to x.\nDefinition 4.1 (Spaces of Differentiatial Operators). For any nonnegative integers a, b we denote by D(a, b) the vector space of all differentiations of polynomial degree at most a and order at most b. We extend\nthis definition to negative indices by defining D(a, b) = {0} if either a\nor b is negative. By polynomial degree of A we mean the highest power\nof the polynomials appearing as coefficients in A.\nWe remark that D(0, b) consists of differential operators with constant coefficients.\nDefinition 4.2 (Adjoint Representation). For any two differentiations\nA1 \u2208 D(a1 , b1 ) and A2 \u2208 D(a2 , b2 ) we define adA1 (A2 ) by\n(4.1)\n\nadA1 (A2 ) := [A1 , A2 ] = A1 A2 \u2212 A2 A1 ,\n\nas usual, and for any integer j \u2265 1 we define adjA1 (A2 ) recursively by\n(4.2)\n\nj\u22121\nadjA1 (A2 ) := adA1 (adA\n(A2 ))\n1\n\nProposition 4.3.

We observe that etL0 is a convolution operator, since z is fixed,\ntherefore\n\u0001\nz\u0001\nz\nP\u03b1 (x, z, \u2202) eL0 (x, y) = P\u03b1 (x, z, \u2202) eL0 (x, y) .\nz\n\nThen, the result follows from formula (1.6) for eL0 (x, y), formula (4.7)\nfor P\u03b1 (x, z, \u2202), and the fact that P l is a sum of such operators as \u03b1\nvaries over Al . (See also Lemma 5.1 in the next section, Section 5.) \u0003\nThe method introduced in this and the previous sections to approximate the heat kernel of L will be called the Dyson-Taylor commutator\nmethod. Its description is now complete.\n5. Error estimates\nIn this final section, we prove all the bounds necessary to justify the\nerror estimate in the asymptotic expansion of Theorem 1.1. Throughout\nthis section, n will denote the order in the Taylor expansion of the\ncoefficients of L, which may differ from the approximation order as\ndefined in equation (3.18). Such approximation order will be denoted\nby \u03bc, as in the statement of Theorem 1.1. Recall that the definition of\nthe operators \u039b\u03b1,z depends, in principle, on n. However, if \u03b1 \u2208 Ak,l and\nn is large (n \u2265 k, n \u2265 \u03b1j ) the operator \u039b\u03b1,z no longer depends on n (in\nwhich case it does not depend on s either). This observation, together\nwith the fact that n is fixed, justifies omitting n from the notation for\n\u039b\u03b1,z . Moreover, the error terms Es,z\nd,\u03bd are independent of d, as long as\ns,z\nd \u2265 \u03bd, which will always be the case, so we shall write Es,z\n\u03bd,\u03bd = Ed,\u03bd .\nBelow, we will use such error terms for \u03bd = \u03bc and \u03bd = n, with n > \u03bc\nappropriately chosen.\nWe start from Lemma 3.10. All the terms appearing in that lemma\nare operators with smooth distribution kernels by Corollary 3.9. We\nrecall that we denote by T (x, y) the distribution kernel of an operator T\nwith smooth kernel (so T (x, y) is a smooth function such that T f (x) =\n31\n\n\fR\n\nT (x, y)f (y)dy).

However, splitting the error as done above will\nallow a better control on the error estimate of Theorem 1.1. In fact,\nwe will show that each \u039blz in the first sum, which does not depend on\ns, is a pseudodifferential operator, and its contribution to the overall\nerror after the parabolic rescaling will be obtained in terms of a refined\nanalysis on its symbol. This analysis, in turn, leads to some refined\nestimates uniformly in s on the norm of the operator between weighted\nSobolev Spaces. On the other hand, we will obtain only rough estimates\non the remander term En,n , which will nevertheless be enough, due to\nthe additional factor sn+1\u2212\u03bc . The main issue in treating the remainder\nis that some of its terms \u039b\u03b1,z implicitly depend on s, a fact which\nmakes it difficult to show the remainder is also a pseudodifferential\noperator, at least in the usual H\u00f6rmader class. It may be possible to\nshow that En,n is indeed a pseudodifferential operator employing more\nexotic symbol classes or amplitudes, but we do not need to pursue this\npoint here, since we are able to prove the sharp estimates of Theorem\n1.1 in any case.\nWe now proceed along these lines.

When \u039b\u03b1,z is independent of s (that is for \u03b1 \u2208 Ak,l , k \u2264 n,\n\u03b1i \u2264 n), we shall derive some more precise estimates. We begin with\nthese refined, more precise estimates.\n5.1. Precise estimates. Recall that we denote by \u039b\u03b1,z (x, y) the distribution kernel of the operator \u039b\u03b1,z since it is a smooth function. Thus,\nfor \u03b1 \u2208 Ak,l , k \u2264 n, \u03b1i \u2264 n, \u039b\u03b1,z (x, y) does not depend on s. Let us\nfix a function z(x, y), which will be specified later, and let Ls,\u03b1 be the\noperator with distribution kernel\ns\u2212N \u039b\u03b1,z (z + s\u22121 (x \u2212 z), z + s\u22121 (y \u2212 z)),\n\nintroduced above in Equation (5.9), where z = z(x, y).\nWe will show below that in this range of \u03b1 for a suitable choice of\nthe function z, the operator Ls,\u03b1 is a pseudodifferential operator whose\nsymbol is well behaved. We shall then use symbol calculus to derive\nthe desired error estimates. We refer to [51] for all relevant properties\nof pseudodifferential operators.\nBelow, we follow the usual convention\n\u221a\nand set D = 1i \u2202, (i = \u22121), where if not specified otherwise \u2202 = \u2202x .\nWe shall need the standard seminorms pm,\u03b1,\u03b2 given by\n(5.12)\n\npm,\u03b1,\u03b2 (a) =\n\nsup\n(x,\u03be)\u2208RN \u00d7RN\n\n|h\u03bei|\u03b2|\u2212m\u2202x\u03b1 \u2202\u03be\u03b2 a(x, \u03be)|.\n\nm\nm\nThen the H\u00f6rmander class S1,0\n:= S(1,0)\n(RN \u00d7 RN ), m > \u2212\u221e, is by\ndefinition the set of functions a : R2N \u2192 C satisfying pm,\u03b1,\u03b2 (a) < \u221e.\nThe space S \u2212\u221e = S \u2212\u221e (RN \u00d7 RN ) is defined by the same seminorms,\nbut with m \u2208 Z arbitrary.\nWe also denote by\nZ\n(5.13)\nF u(x) = \u00fb(\u03be) :=\ne\u2212i \u03be*x u(x)dx\nRN\n\nthe usual Fourier transform of u.

If the integral operator defined by K, which is smoothing, is in fact a pseudodifferential operator a(x, D), then we can recover a from K by the formula\n(F2\u22121a)(x, y) = K(x, x \u2212 y), so\nZ\n(5.15)\na(x, \u03be) =\ne\u2212i \u03be*y K(x, x \u2212 y)dy.\nRN\n\nT\n\n\u22121\n\nRecall next the function G(z; x) = (4\u03c0)\u2212N/2 det(A(z))\u22121/2 e\u2212x A(z) x/4\nz\nintroduced in Equation (1.6): Then the distribution kernel of eL0 is\ngiven by\n(5.16)\n\nz\n\neL0 (x, y) = G(z; x \u2212 y),\n\nand we have the following result.\nLemma 5.1. Let z \u2208 RN be a parameter and let us consider the opz\nerator T = (x \u2212 z)\u03b2 \u2202x\u03b3 eL0 , where \u03b2 and \u03b3 are multi-indices. Then the\ndistribution kernel of T is given by\nT (x, y) = (x \u2212 z)\u03b2 (\u2202x\u03b3 G)(z; x \u2212 y).\nProof. The Lemma follows from a direct computation.\n\n\u0003\n\nWe will also need the following standard result.\nLemma 5.2. (i) The Fourier transform in the second variable establishes an isomorphism F2 : S \u2212\u221e := S \u2212\u221e (RN \u00d7 RN ) \u2192 S \u2212\u221e .\nm\n(ii) Multiplication defines a continuous map S(1,0)\n\u00d7 S \u2212\u221e \u2192 S \u2212\u221e .\n\u2212\u221e\n(iii) If {as }s\u2208(0,1] is uniformly bounded in S\nand bs (x, \u03be) = as (x, s\u03be),\n\u2212k\nthen the family {sk bs }s\u2208(0,1] is uniformly bounded in S1,0\n, k \u2265 0.\nProof. This follows from a straightforward calculation.\n\n\u0003\n\nFor our main result, we require some assumptions on the dilation\ncenter z.\nDefinition 5.3. A function z : R2N \u2192 RN will be called admissible if\n(i) z(x, x) = x, for all x \u2208 RN .\n(ii) All derivatives of z are bounded.\n35\n\n\fA typical example is z(x, y) = \u03bbx+(1\u2212\u03bb)y, for some fixed parameter\n\u03bb. A simple application of the mean value theorem gives that hz \u2212xi \u2264\nChy \u2212 xi for some constant C > 0.\nWe are now ready to state and prove the main result of this subsection.\nTheorem 5.4. Let \u03b1 \u2208 Ak,l , k \u2264 n, \u03b1 \u2264 n. Assume that z :\nR2N \u2192 RN is admissible. Then there exists a uniformly bounded family\n{as }s\u2208(0,1] in S \u2212\u221e such that, if bs (x, \u03be) := as (x, s\u03be), then\nLs,\u03b1 = bs (x, D).\n\nProof. By Lemma 4.6, we have that \u039b\u03b1,z is a finite sum of terms of\nz\nthe form \u03c6(z)(x \u2212 z)\u03b2 \u2202x\u03b3 eL0 with \u03c6 \u2208 Cb\u221e . Let then kz (x, y) be the\nz\ndistribution kernel of a(z)(x \u2212 z)\u03b2 \u2202x\u03b3 eL0 and let\nKs (x, y) := s\u2212N kz (z + s\u22121 (x \u2212 z), z + s\u22121 (y \u2212 z)),\n\nz = z(x, y).\n\nBy abuse of notation, we shall denote also by Ks the integral operator\ndefined by Ks . It is enough then to prove our theorem for Ks . Namely,\nit is enough to show that there exists a uniformly bounded family\n{as }s\u2208(0,1] in S \u2212\u221e such that\nKs = as (x, sD).\n\nz\n\nBy lemma 5.1, we have that the distribution kernel of \u2202x\u03b3 eL0 is of\nthe form \u03c8(z, x \u2212 y) and belong to S \u2212\u221e as a function of x \u2212 y for z\nz\nfixed. (This is consistend with the fact that for each fixed z, \u2202x\u03b3 eL0 is\nT\na convolution operator.) More precisely \u03c8(z, x) is F2 (i \u03be)\u03b3 e\u2212\u03be *A(z)*\u03be .\nThis observation implies\nKs (x, y) = \u03c6(z(x, y))s\u2212|\u03b2|\u2212N (x \u2212 z(x, y))\u03b2 \u03c8(z(x, y), s\u22121 (x \u2212 y)) =:\n\u03c6(z)s\u2212|\u03b2|\u2212N (x \u2212 z)\u03b2 \u03c8(z, s\u22121 (x \u2212 y)),\n\nWe then let\nZ\nbs (x, \u03be) =\ne\u2212i y*\u03be \u03c6(z)s\u2212|\u03b2|\u2212N (x \u2212 z)\u03b2 \u03c8(z, s\u22121 y)dy,\nRN\n\nz = z(x, y).\n\nz = z(x, x \u2212 y).\n\nNext, we observe that if we change variables from y to sy, we can write\nbs (x, \u03be) = as (x, s\u03be), where\nZ\nas (x, \u03be) =\ne\u2212i y*\u03be \u03c6(z)s\u2212|\u03b2| (x \u2212 z)\u03b2 \u03c8(z, y)dy, z = z(x, x \u2212 sy).\nRN\n\nWe need to show that as is a bounded family in S \u2212\u221e . To this end, we\nobserve that, since \u03c6 \u2208 Cb\u221e and the derivatives of z are all bounded,\n1\n\u03c6(z) \u2208 S1,0\nas a function of y for each x. Similarly, for each j =\n\u22121\n1\n1, . . . , N, s (xj \u2212 zj (x, x \u2212 sy)) \u2208 S1,0\nas a function of y for fixed x,\n36\n\n\fand collectively they form bounded families for s \u2208 (0, 1]. Lastly, from\nwhat already observed above, \u03c8(z, y) \u2208 S \u2212\u221e as a function of y for each\nfixed x. Therefore, as \u2208 S \u2212\u221e uniformly in s by Lemma 5.2. The proof\nis complete.\n\u0003\nWe now obtain the desired refined mapping property estimate by\nstandard results on pseudodifferential operators. Below, t = s2 .\nTheorem 5.5. Let \u03b1 \u2208 Ak,l , k \u2264 n, \u03b1j \u2264 n. Assume that z : R2N \u00d7RN\nis admissible. Then for any 1 < p < \u221e, any r \u2208 R,\n(5.17)\n\ntk/2 kLs,\u03b1kW r,p \u2192W r+k,p \u2264 Ck,r,p,\n\nfor a constant Ck,r,p independent of t \u2208 (0, 1].\n\n5.2. Rough estimates. We now move to study the mapping properties of \u039b\u03b1,z when either \u03b1 \u2208 An+1,l or some \u03b1i = n + 1. In this case,\nthe operators \u039b\u03b1,z depend on s also, although this dependence is not\nshown in the notation.\nThe mapping properties that we establish in this subsection will allow us to obtain corresponding mapping properties for the error operator Es,z\nn,n , which is not immediately in the form of a pseudodifferential\noperator. Consequently, we are not able to derive bounds as those in\nTheorem 5.4 above. Nevertheless, the bounds we derive are sufficient\nto establish the sharp error estimates as t \u2192 0+ in weighted Sobolev\nspaces for the overall approximation, given in Theorem 1.1. This result\nis achieved by choosing judiciously an n large enough.\nr,p\nAs before we denote War,p = Wa,w\nas before, where w is the center of\nthe weight hxiw = hx \u2212 wi = hw \u2212 xi used to define the exponentially\nweighted Sobolev spaces (see equation (2.4)). We shall also write Lpa =\nWa0,p . The main result of this section is the following proposition.\nProposition 5.6. Assume that z : R2N \u2192 RN is admissible. For any\n\u03b1, any 1 < p < \u221e, k \u2208 Z+ , r \u2265 0, and a \u2208 R,\n(5.18)\n\nsk kLs,\u03b1kLpa \u2192Wak,p \u2264 Ck,p ,\n\nfor a constant Ck,p independent of s \u2208 (0, 1], of a in a bounded set,\nand independent of the center of the weight that defines the weighted\nSobolev spaces Wak,p .\nProof. The proof is based on explicit kernel estimates and Riesz' lemma.\nBy replacing the operator L with eahx\u2212wi Le\u2212ahx\u2212wi , where w is the center of the weight, we can assume that a = 0, as before.\nAs before, \u039b\u03b1,z (x, y) is the smooth distribution kernel of the operator\n\u039b\u03b1,z . For any given point v \u2208 RN , we denote by \u03b4v\u03b2 the distribution\n37\n\n\fdefined by \u03b4v\u03b2 (f ) = \u2202 \u03b2 f (v) (we agree that \u03b4v0 (f ) = f (v). Then\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2202x\u03b2 \u2202y\u03b2 \u2202z\u03b2 \u039b\u03b1,z (x, y) = h\u03b4x\u03b2 , (\u2202z\u03b2 \u039b\u03b1,z )(\u03b4y\u03b2 )i,\n\n(5.19)\n\nwhere h, i is the usual duality pairing. Since all the coefficients (and\ntheir derivatives) of L are uniformly bounded, the derivative \u2202z\u03b2 \u039b\u03b1,z\nwill satisfy the same mapping properties as \u039b\u03b1,z . Furthermore, for\neach multi-index \u03b2, \u2202 \u03b2 \u03b4y \u2208 H \u2212q (RN ) for q > N/2 + |\u03b2| and has norm\nindependent of y.\nIn the rest of the proof, we use the weighted Sobolev spaces introduced in (2.4). We recall that the mapping properties between these\nspaces are uniform in term of the base point. We can therefore choose\ns,2\nthe weight center at x in estimating (5.19). We will write Has = Wa,x\n.\n\u2212q\nThen \u03b4y \u2208 Ha for all a \u2208 R, q > N/2 + |\u03b2|, with\nk\u2202 \u03b2 \u03b4y kHa\u2212q := kea<y\u2212x> \u2202 \u03b2 \u03b4y kH \u2212q \u2264 Cq,\u03b1 e(a+\u01eb)hy\u2212xi .\nNext, we pick an \u01eb > 0 small enough. Replacing \u01eb with \u01eb/k, where k\nis such that \u03b1 \u2208 Uk,l in Corollary 3.9 yields\nk\u2202z\u03b2 \u039b\u03b1,z kH \u2212q \u2192H q\n\u2212a\n\n\u2212a\u2212\u01eb/k\n\nk \u2264 e\u01ebhx\u2212zi ,\n\nand hence\n(5.20)\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2202x\u03b2 \u2202z\u03b2 \u2202y\u03b2 \u039b\u03b1,z (x, y) = h\u2202 \u03b2 \u03b4x , \u2202z\u03b2 \u039b\u03b1,z \u2202 \u03b2 \u03b4y i\n\u2264 Ck\u2202 \u03b2 \u03b4x kH \u2212q\n\n\u2212a\u2212\u01eb /k\n\n\u2032\n\nk\u2202z\u03b2 \u039b\u03b1,z kH \u2212q \u2192H q\n\u2212a\n\n\u2212a\u2212\u01eb/k\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\nk\u2202 \u03b2 \u03b4y kH \u2212q\n\n\u2212a\n\n\u2264 Ce\u01ebhx\u2212zi\u2212(a+\u01eb)hy\u2212xi ,\nwhere q > N/2 + max(|\u03b2|, |\u03b2 \u2032|, |\u03b2 \u2032\u2032|).\nWe will employ the bounds above to estimate\n(5.21)\nLs,\u03b1(x, y) = s\u2212N \u039b\u03b1,z (z + s\u22121 (x \u2212 z), z + s\u22121 (y \u2212 z)),\n\nz = z(x, y).\n\nWe first use the chain rule to conclude that, if \u03b3 is any multi-index,\nthen \u2202x\u03b3 Ls,\u03b1 (x, y) is a sum of terms of the form\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\ns\u2212j \u2202x\u03b2 \u2202z\u03b2 \u2202y\u03b2 \u039b\u03b1,z (z + s\u22121 (x \u2212 z), z + s\u22121 (y \u2212 z))P,\nfor appropriate multi-indices \u03b2, \u03b2 \u2032 , and \u03b2 \u2032\u2032 , with P a product of factors\n\u2032\nof the form \u2202 \u03b1 z and j \u2264 |\u03b3|. Our assumptions on z imply that p is\nbounded. Using also Equation (5.20), we obtain for \u01eb sufficiently small,\n(5.22)\n\n\u2202x\u03b3 Ls,\u03b1 (x, y) \u2264 Cs\u2212N \u2212|\u03b3| e\u01ebhs\n\n\u22121 (x\u2212z)i\u2212ahs\u22121 (y\u2212x)i\n\n\u2264 Cs\u2212N \u2212|\u03b3| e\u2212ahs\n38\n\n\u22121 (y\u2212x)i/2\n\n,\n\nz = z(x, y),\n\n\fwhere the last inequality follows from hx \u2212 zi \u2264 Chy \u2212 xi. From this\ninequality, we obtain after the change of variables v = s\u22121 (y \u2212 x)\nZ\n\u2202x\u03b3 Ls,\u03b1(x, y) dy \u2264 Ca s\u2212|\u03b3| , \u2200x \u2208 RN ,\nRN\n\nand\n\nZ\n\n\u2202x\u03b3 Ls,\u03b1(x, y) dx \u2264 Ca s\u2212|\u03b3| ,\n\nRN\n\n\u2200y \u2208 RN ,\n\nThese two estimates together with Riesz Lemma give that the map\nf \u2192 s|\u03b3| \u2202x\u03b3 Ls,\u03b1 f is bounded from Lp to Lp , which is enough to establish\nthe result.\n\u0003\nThis proposition, and the definition of Es,z\nn,n immediately imply the\n2\nfollowing lemma, where as usual t = s .\nLemma 5.7. Assume that z : R2N \u00d7 RN is admissible, then for each\nr \u2208 R, q > 0, we have\n[n,z]\n\nkEt\n\nkW r,p \u2192W r+q,p \u2264 CT t\u2212(r+q)/2 ,\n\nt \u2208 (0, T ].\n\nProof. Indeed, this follows from Proposition 5.6, Equation (5.10), and\nthe continuous inclusion W r,p \u0592\u2192 Lp , r \u2265 0. For r noninteger we also\nuse interpolation.\n\u0003\nWe note that in the above proposition we have an additional factor of\nt\u2212q/2 compared with the refined estimates of Theorem 5.5. This extra\nfactor will not affect the final result, however, provided the order n of\nthe Taylor expansion of L is chosen sufficiently large.\nThen, the lemma leads to the following more precise estimate for the\n[\u03bc,z]\nerror operator Et .\n\nTheorem 5.8.
