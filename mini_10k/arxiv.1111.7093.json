Kobelev\nAbstract.\nThe history of structural optimization as an exact science begins possibly with\nthe celebrated Lagrange problem: to find a curve which by its revolution about\nan axis in its plane determines the rod of greatest efficiency [1]. The Lagrange\nhypothesis, that the optimal rod possesses the constant cross-section was abandoned for Euler buckling problem [2]. In this Article the Lagrange hypothesis is\nproved to be valid for Greenhill's problem of torque buckling. The corresponding isoperimetric inequality is affirmed.\n\n1. Introduction\nWe study the optimal shape of a thin elastic rod, twisted by couples applied at its\nends alone (Greenhill's problem). The ends of the rod are assumed to be attached to the supports by ideal spherical hinges and are free to rotate in any directions. The twisting couple retains its initial direction during buckling. The\ndistribution of material along the length of a twisted rod is optimized so that the\nrod is of minimum volume and will support a given moment without spatial\nbuckling. Introduction of new unknown variables reduces the problem to the exactly solvable auxiliary problem with constant coefficients, such that the critical\nbuckling moment of a rod with an arbitrary shape allows the exact representation as the certain integral functional. The strict upper boundary of this functional is stated by means of H\u00f6lder's inequality. Thus, the exact solution of optimization problem is stated in form of isoperimetric inequality, involving the\nlength of the rod, its volume and critical torque. Remarkable, that in accordance\nwith Lagrange hypothesis in the torsion problem the optimal shape of the rod is\nconstant along its length.\n\n2. Exact solution of the Greenhill's problem with an isotropic\ncross-section\nConsider a thin elastic rod with isotropic cross-section, twisted by couples applied at its ends alone (Greenhill's problem). The ends of the rod x = 0 and x = l\nare assumed to be attached to the supports by ideal spherical hinges and are free\nto rotate in any directions. The twisting couple M retains its initial direction during buckling.

However, it is a conservative system of the\nsecond kind [3]. From earlier investigation [4] it is known that indeed the trace of\nthe eigenvalue curve is such that the system buckles by divergence, and the that\nthe exact buckling loads of Greenhill's problem is\n(4) M * =\n\n2\u03c0EJ\n.\nl\n\nIntroduction of the independent variable \u03be [5]\n\u03be\n\ndt\n,\nF (\u03be )\n\n(5) x = \u222b\n0\n\nF (\u03be ) > 0,\n\nreduces the problem (2)-(3) to\n(6) F (\u03be )EJ\n\ndY\ndZ\n= MZ + c1 , F (\u03be )EJ\n= \u2212 MY + c 2 , Y (0) = Z (0) = Y ( L) = Z ( L) = 0\nd\u03be\nd\u03be\n\nwith\n\uf8eb \u03be dt \uf8f6\n\uf8f7 = Y (\u03be ) , z ( x ) =\ny ( x ) = y\uf8ec\uf8ec \u222b\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ed 0 F (t ) \uf8f8\n\n\uf8eb \u03be dt \uf8f6\n\uf8f7 = Z (\u03be )\nz \uf8ec\uf8ec \u222b\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ed 0 F (t ) \uf8f8\n\nThe value L is the solution of the algebraic equation\nL\n\n(7) l = \u222b\n0\n\nd\u03be\n.\nF (\u03be )\n\nEigenvalue problem (5)-(6) describes the Greenhill's problem with a variable\nbending stiffness EJF (\u03be ) over the length.
