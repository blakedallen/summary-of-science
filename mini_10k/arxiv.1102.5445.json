We employ newly\ndeveloped effective model for the interstellar H atom velocity distribution function\nin the heliosphere (Katushkina & Izmodenov 2010, 2011). This model takes into\naccount both global effects of H atom perturbations at the heliospheric boundaries\nand local (i.e. within 10-20 AU from the Sun) effects of the solar ionization, charge\nexchange, solar gravitation and radiation pressure.\nBackscattered solar Ly-\u03b1 profiles and their zero, first and second moments were\ncomputed at 1 AU for the anti-solar directions of line-of-sight.

The solar wind interacts with interstellar plasma and complex structure of the interaction region is formed due to relative Sun/CHISM\nmotion (see Fig.1 A). CHISM is a weakly (20-30 %) ionized plasma and\nmainly consists of hydrogen. The mean free path of the interstellar hydrogen atoms (H atoms) is larger or comparable with the characteristic distance\nof the SW/CHISM interaction region. Therefore, H atoms penetrate deeply\nto the heliosphere, where properties of H atom component can be measured\ndirectly on indirectly. Due to their large mean free path in the heliosphere a\nkinetic approach should be used to describe H atom component theoretically.\nThe first self-consistent kinetic-gasdynamical model of the SW/CHISM interaction has been developed by Baranov & Malama (1993) (Baranov-Malama\nmodel hereafter). It was shown that the SW/CHISM interaction region (that\nis often called in literature as the heliospheric interface) consists of four regions\nwith different plasma properties. These regions are separated by three discontinuity surfaces, namely, the termination shock and bow shock are boundaries\nof the supersonic solar wind and interstellar medium flows, accordingly, and\nthe heliopause is a tangential surface separated charged components of the\ntwo plasma flows.\nOne of the results obtained by Baranov & Malama (1993) and previously\nby Baranov et al. (1991) is the hydrogen wall that was discovered experimentally by Linsky & Wood (1996) (see also Wood et al., 2007a, 2007b for recent\ndevelopments). The hydrogen wall is an increase of H atom density in the vicinity of the heliopause due to production of newly created H atoms by charge\nexchange. These secondary atoms have properties of plasma in the vicinity\n\u2217 Corresponding author.\nEmail addresses: okat@iki.rssi.ru (Olga A. Katushkina),\nizmod@iki.rssi.ru (Vladislav V.

The interstellar plasma in the vicinity of the heliopause is\nheated and decelerated, and, therefore, the mean velocity of the secondary H\natom population is smaller and the temperature is larger as compared with\nthe velocity and temperature of the original (or primary) H atom population\nthat consists of interstellar atoms, which entering into the heliopshere without\nbeing charge exchanged in the heliospheric interface. A mixture of the primary\nand secondary interstellar H atom populations penetrate to the heliosphere.\nInside the heliosphere in region between the heliopause and the termination\nshock (this region is often called as the inner heliosheath) new atoms are\nalso created during charge-exchange. These atoms are called as the energetic\nneutral atoms (ENAs) and now they are measured by Interstellar Boundary\nExplorer spacecraft (McComas et al., 2009). ENAs have a small number density in the heliosphere as compared with interstellar atoms, that is why ENAs\nare not important for backscattered Ly-\u03b1 radiation.\nIt was recognized since 1970s that the solar Ly-\u03b1 photons are effectively\nbackscattered by the interstellar H atoms. Spectral properties of the backscattered Ly-\u03b1 radiation depend on the velocity and spatial distribution of the\ninterstellar hydrogen inside the heliosphere. Since the distribution of H atoms\nis disturbed in the heliospheric interface, then the backscattered Ly-\u03b1 may,\nin principle, serve as the source of information on the heliospheric interface\nstructure. For example, Costa et al. (1999) analyzed SOHO/SWAN data and\n3\n\n\fshowed that the temperature of the interstellar hydrogen at large distances\nfrom the Sun (at 50 AU where local effects of solar gravitation, radiation\nand ionization are negligible) is significantly higher then temperature of the\nCHISM. The bulk velocity of the hydrogen flow obtained by this analysis is\nabout 21 km/s that is \u223c5 km/s smaller than the relative SW/CHISM velocity. These differences in the properties of the hydrogen gas as compared\nwith the properties of the CHISM are explained by existence of the secondary\ninterstellar H atom population in the heliopshere.\nThe effect of the heliospheric interface is also seen in the measured (Lallement et al.,\n2005) deflection of the interstellar H atom flow direction as compared with the\ndirection of the interstellar helium. In contrast to the hydrogen the chargeexchange cross-section of helium (He + H + \u2194 He+ + H) is small, that is why\nit is usually assumed that the interstellar helium stay practically undisturbed\nduring its motion from CHISM to the heliosphere. It means that the velocity\nvector of the helium flow in the vicinity of the Sun refers to the value and\nto direction of the interstellar gas flow. In turn, hydrogen atom flow is affected by charge-exchange with protons in the SW/CHISM interaction region.\nThe deflection of hydrogen atoms inside the heliosphere from the direction of\nSW/CHISM relative motion is most probably due to distortion of the global\nheliospheric interface structure caused by the interstellar magnetic field that\nleads to asymmetry of interstellar plasma flow in the heliospheric interface and\nthis asymmetry transfers to H atoms through the charge-exchange. This fact\nopened a possibility to estimate magnitude and direction of the interstellar\nmagnetic field (e.g. Izmodenov et al., 2005).\nAnother manifestation of the heliospheric interface was found during analyzes of the second moment of the backscattered Ly-\u03b1 radiation spectra. This\nmoment corresponds to the width of the spectra and depends on the width\nof the H atom velocity distribution. Being expressed in the units of temperature the line-width is often called as the line-of-sight (or l-o-s) temperature.\nCosta et al. (1999) and Quemerais et al. (2006) derived the l-o-s temperature\nof the backscattered Ly-\u03b1 from SOHO/SWAN data and presented the temperature as a function of the angle \u03b8 between the line-of-sight direction and the\ndirection toward the CHISM flow (i.e. the upwind direction). It was shown that\nthe temperature in the directions of \u03b8 = 50-60\u25e6 is smaller by 1500-2000 K than\nthe temperature toward upwind. This minimum was explained by Costa et al.\n(1999) and Quemerais et al. (2006) qualitatively by presence of the primary\nand secondary populations of the interstellar hydrogen atoms.\nThe goal of this study is to theoretically explore the imprints of the heliospheric interface on spectral properties of the backscattered Ly-\u03b1 radiation\nand separate these effects from the local effects (i.e. the effects that act within\n10-20 AU of the Sun) of the solar ionization, charge exchange, solar gravitation\nand radiation pressure. We have computed line profiles and their moments of\n4\n\n\fthe backscattered Ly-\u03b1 spectra based on newly developed advanced kinetic\nmodel of the hydrogen distribution in the heliosphere (Katushkina & Izmodenov, 2010, 2011). This model combines comparative simplicity of the classical\nhot model with ability to account for both the perturbations of the hydrogen distribution function in the SW/CHISM interaction region (later it will\nbe mentioned as effects of the heliospheric interface) and local effects which\nare significant only in the vicinity of the Sun. In order to separate the heliospheric boundary effects from the local effects we compare new model results\nwith the results of the simplified hot models, which describe local effects in\nsimilar way as the advanced model, but do not take into account the effects\nof the heliospheric boundaries.\n\n2\n\nModeling of the hydrogen distribution inside the heliosphere\n\nTo model spatial and velocity distribution of the interstellar hydrogen in\nthe heliosphere we solve a kinetic equation (see, e.g. Katushkina & Izmodenov,\n2010) for the distribution function f (r, w, t) of the hydrogen atoms inside the\nsphere with radius of 90 AU around the Sun (see Fig. 1 B). The processes\nof the photoionization, charge-exchange, solar gravitation and solar radiation\npressure are taken into account. It is assumed in the model that the rates of\ncharge exchange \u03b2ex and photoionization \u03b2ph decrease with distance from the\nSun as 1/r 2 . We use following values of ionization rates at the Earth orbit:\n\u03b2ph,E = 1.16 \u00d7 10\u22127 s\u22121 , \u03b2ex,E = 4.8 \u00d7 10\u22127 s\u22121 . To calculate the chargeexchange rate at the Earth orbit we use averaged values of the solar wind\nnumber density (6 cm\u22123 ) and velocity (440 km/s) known from measurements,\nand charge-exchange cross-section from Lindsay & Stebbing (2005). The solar\ngravitational force and the force of the radiation pressure act in opposite\ndirections and both are proportional to 1/r 2, where r is a distance to the Sun.\nDimensionless parameter \u03bc defines a balance between the solar gravitation\nand radiation pressure. In this work we assume that \u03bc is equal to 1.258.\nIn this paper we consider three models which differ each from other by\nboundary conditions at 90 AU. Model 1 is the one-component hot model\nthat implies the Maxwellian velocity distribution function at the outer boundary. For the specific calculations performed in the frame of this model we use\nparameters of the Maxwellian distribution (i.e. number density, bulk velocity\nand temperature) calculated at 90 AU in the upwind direction in the frame\nof the Baranov-Malama model with parameters of chosen to be the same as\nin Katushkina & Izmodenov (2010). These values at 90 AU are: nH = 0.54\n*nH,LISM , VH,z = -0.79*VH,LISM , TH = 15 000 K, where nH,LISM =0.18 cm\u22123 ,\nVH,LISM =26.4 km/s. These parameters correspond to the mixture of the primary and secondary interstellar atoms. Note, the effects of the heliospheric\ninterface are taken in this model at zero level by taking parameters in the\n5\n\n\fMaxwellian distribution different from the CHISM parameters.\nModel 2 is so-called two-component hot model (e.g. Bzowski et al., 2008).\nIn this case model 1 is employed separately for the primary and secondary populations of interstellar atoms. The velocity distribution functions are assumed\nto be Maxwellian for each of the populations and parameters of the distribution functions were calculated in the frame of Baranov-Malama model. These\nparameters for the primary interstellar atoms are: nH,prim = 0.22 *nH,LISM ,\nVz,prim = -1.06*VH,LISM , TH,prim = 6 840 K, and for the secondary interstellar atoms: nH,second = 0.32 *nH,LISM , Vz,second = -0.63*VH,LISM , TH,second = 18\n126 K.\nAs it was shown in Katushkina & Izmodenov (2010), model 2 leads to significant discrepancies in the distribution of H atoms inside the heliosphere as\ncompared with the self-consistent Baranov-Malama model. This fact is connected with non-Maxwellian behavior of the velocity distribution function of\nhydrogen atoms after their crossing the heliospheric interface (Izmodenov et al.,\n2001; Izmodenov, 2001).\nIn model 3 we use the boundary conditions allowing to get the distribution\nof H atom inside the heliosphere in very good agreement with the distribution\nobtained in the frame of Baranov-Malama model. For the primary interstellar\natoms the distribution function at 90 AU is chosen as 3D normal distribution. In this case all zero, first and second moments of the velocity distribution function are taken into account (see Katushkina & Izmodenov, 2010) and\ncalculated in the frame of Baranov-Malama model. However, for the population of the secondary interstellar atoms such approach does not give the full\nagreement with the Baranov-Malama model because the distribution function of this population is asymmetric with respect to its maximum and it has\nnonzero third moments which are neglected in the 3D normal distribution.\nThat is why for the secondary interstellar atoms Katushkina & Izmodenov\n(2011) have used the velocity distribution function of at 90 AU calculated by\nMonte-Carlo in the frame of the Baranov-Malama model. It was shown that\n15-20 millions of unsplitted (Malama, 1991) trajectories in the Monte-Carlo\ncode is enough in order to get acceptable accuracy of calculations. In this paper\nwe follow Katushkina & Izmodenov (2011) approach for the primary interstellar atoms and use the numerically calculated velocity distribution function as\nthe boundary conditions at 90 AU for the secondary interstellar atoms.\nIt is important to note here that for the stationary and axisymmetric case\nmodel 3 provides the same distributions within 90 AU from the Sun as the\nBaranov-Malama model. However, computationally our model is more effective and allows to calculate the velocity distribution function everywhere inside\nthe heliosphere with required precision. Moreover, our model allows to study\nlocal (i.e. within the heliosphere) time-dependent and 3D phenomena very\n6\n\n\feffectively.\n\n3\n\nModeling of the backscattered solar Ly-\u03b1 profiles\n\nThe backscattered Ly-\u03b1 profiles I(r,\u03bd,\u03a9) were computed for anti-solar radial directions (\u03a9) for an observer located at 1 AU. Here r is a position of\nobserver, \u03bd is a frequency of the backscattered radiation, \u03a9 is the line-of-sight.\nWe use \"self-absorption\" approximation (Quemerais, 2000). In this approximation only once scattered photons are considered (i.e. multiple scattering of\nphotons are neglected), and absorption of the photons between the Sun and\nthe scattering point is neglected. Despite this simplified \"self-absorption\" approach gives similar results as compared with a full radiative transfer model.\nQuemerais & Izmodenov (2002) have shown that for the line-width of the\nbackscattered profile at 1 AU the difference between full radiative transfer\nmodel and the self-absorption model is less than 15 % for the upwind direction and becomes smaller as the line-of-sight moves from upwind to downwind.\nIn the downwind direction the two approaches give practically the same linewidths. The simplified self-absorption approach is sufficient for the purposes\nof this paper. As it will be seen the effects of the heliospheric interface are\nessentially larger than the difference between the full radiative transfer and\nself-absorption models.\nThe radiative transfer equation for I(r,\u03bd,\u03a9) can be written as follows:\n\u03a9 * \u2207I(r, \u03bd, \u03a9) = \u2212\u03c3\u03bd (r, \u03bd)nH (r)I(r, \u03bd, \u03a9) + nH (r)j(r, \u03bd, \u2212\u03a9).\n\n(1)\n\nHere nH (r) is the number density of hydrogen atoms, \u03c3\u03bd (r, \u03bd) is the differential\nscattering cross-section that is proportional to the projection of the hydrogen\ndistribution function on the line-of-sight, j(r,\u03bd,-\u03a9) is the atomic emission coefficient which measures the number of photons emitted by a hydrogen atom per\nsecond per frequency unit and per solid angle. Note, that scattered photons\ntravel in the direction opposite to the line-of-sight direction i.e. in \u2212\u03a9. The\nfirst term in the right hand of the equation (1) is a loss term due to absorption\nof the scattered photons and the second term is a local source of the emission\ndue to scattering process.\nThe equation (1) has a classical solution in case of the self-absorption approximation:\n4\u03c0\nI(r, \u03bd, \u03a9) = 6\n10\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\nnH (r + s\u03a9) j(r + s\u03a9, \u03bd, \u2212\u03a9) e\u2212\u03c4\u03bd (r+s\u03a9,r) ds,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere, s is a coordinate along the line-of-sight, \u03c4\u03bd (r\u2032 , r) is the optical thickness\nfor scattered photons with frequency \u03bd going from the scattered point r\u2032 =\n7\n\n\fr+s\u03a9 to observer at point r. Ly-\u03b1 profile is measured here in Rayleigh. In this\nsolution only once scattered photons are taken into account, and absorption\nof primary solar photons between the Sun and scattering point is neglected.\nAtomic emission coefficient can be represented as:\nj(r\u2032 , \u03bd, \u2212\u03a9) = \u03c6(\u03c9) FS (r\u2032 , \u03bdp ) \u03c3\u03bd (r\u2032 , \u03bd) .\n\n(3)\n\nHere \u03c6(\u03c9) is a scattering phase function that expresses the relation between direction of propagation of the photon before and after scattering (Brandt & Chamberlain,\n1959). FS (r\u2032 , \u03bdp ) is a flux of primary (solar) Ly-\u03b1 photons with the frequency\nof \u03bdp at point r\u2032 . We use the solar Ly-\u03b1 spectra (Lemaire et al., 1998) to calculate solar Ly-\u03b1 flux at the Earth orbit with defined frequency. In that case\nwhen line-of-sight is radial, there is a simple relation between frequency of\nthe primary solar photon \u03bdp and frequency of the backscattered photon \u03bd:\n\u03bdp = 2 * \u03bd0 \u2212 \u03bd, \u03bd0 is the frequency at line center. Thus, if we know the hydrogen velocity distribution function in the whole heliosphere, we can calculate\nthe profiles of the backscattered Ly-\u03b1 radiation.\nSince we consider the two different populations of interstellar H atoms inside the heliosphere it is possible to calculate profiles of the radiation scattered\nby each populations separately. To do this we consider photons that were scattered by the primary and secondary interstellar atoms independently. Optical\nthickness is calculated for the mixture of the primary and secondary atoms,\nsince a photon scattered, for example, on the primary interstellar atom may\nthen be absorbed by both the primary or secondary atoms.\nWe calculate the following moments of the backscattered radiation profiles:\n\nIlos (r, \u03a9) =\nVlos (r, \u03a9) =\nmH\nTlos (r, \u03a9) =\nkb\n\nR\u221e\n0\n\nR\u221e\n0\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\nI(r, \u03bd, \u03a9) d\u03bd \u2013 intensity in Rayleigh;\n\nu(\u03bd) I(r, \u03bd, \u03a9) d\u03bd\n\u2013 line-shift expressed in [km/s];\nIlos (r, \u03a9)\n\n(u(\u03bd) \u2212 Vlos (r, \u03a9))2 I(r, \u03bd, \u03a9) d\u03bd\n\u2013 line-width expressed in [K].\nIlos (r, \u03a9)\n\nHere, u(\u03bd) = c (\u03bd/\u03bd0 \u2212 1), mH is the mass of a hydrogen atom, kb is the\nBoltzmann constant. The line-shift of the spectra is often called as the line-of\nsight velocity, and the line-width is also called as the line-of-sight (or apparent)\ntemperature. These integral characteristics of the backscattered Ly-\u03b1 profile\nreflect the properties of the velocity distribution function of H atoms inside\nthe heliosphere, but they do not coincide and should not be mixed up with\nthe bulk velocity and temperature of hydrogen atoms far away from the Sun.\n8\n\n\f4\n\nResults of the modeling\n\nWe computed the backscattered Ly-\u03b1 profiles and their moments by making\nuse of three described above models of the hydrogen distribution inside the\nheliosphere. All computations were performed for the anti-solar directions. For\nthe 2D axisymmetric problem considered here each line of sight is characterized\nby one angle \u03b8 that is counted from z-axis (see Fig.1 B).\nFig. 2 shows the intensities (left column), line-shifts (center-column) and\nline-widths (right column) of the backscattered Ly-\u03b1 radiation at 1 AU as\nfunctions of the line-of-sight angle \u03b8. For models 2 and 3 the profiles of the\nphotons scattered by the primary and secondary interstellar H atoms were\ncomputed separately (plots B, C in Fig. 2). The total backscattered profile\nwas calculated as well (plot A). For model 1 that has only one component of\nhydrogen we compute only characteristics of the total Ly-\u03b1 radiation.\nFor the total radiation (plots A) models 1 and 2 lead to systematic increase\nof the intensities as compared with the intensities calculated for model 3.\nComparison of models 2 and 3 for the primary and secondary populations\n(plots B and C) shows that the increase in intensities is due to the secondary\nH atom component (compare left-columns in the plots A and C). Models 2\nand 3 are nicely agreed for the primary H atom component .\nNow, we will explore the main reason of the different results produced by\nmodels 2 and 3. The models are only different in the boundary condition. We\ncan identify two differences of the boundary conditions. The first is the dependence of the boundary conditions on the angle \u03b8 in model 3 that does not\nexist in model 2, since model 2 assumes constant parameters at the boundary.\nThe second difference is the non-Maxwellian velocity distribution function at\n90 AU in model 3, while in model 2 the velocity distribution is Maxwellian.\nTo explore which of the two identified reasons is mainly responsible for the\ndifferences in the spectral properties of Ly-\u03b1 we perform additional model calculation (model 2a). In model 2a we assume that velocity distribution functions at the outer boundary of 90 AU are Maxwellain for both the primary\nand the secondary populations of H atoms. However, the parameters of the\nMaxwellians (i.e. number density, bulk velocity and temperature) are functions\nof the angle \u03b8 that were calculated in the frame of Baranov-Malama model.\nTherefore, model 2a allows to separate the effects of non-uniform flow of H\natoms at 90 AU after they passed the heliospheric interface from the kinetic\neffects connected with non-Maxwellian features of the velocity distribution\nfunction.\nResults of model 2a are also shown in Fig. 2 A. It is seen that model 2a\nand model 3 produce very close results in the backscattered Ly-\u03b1 intensities,\n9\n\n\fFigure 2. Intensities (left column), line-shifts (center-column) and line-widths (right\ncolumn) of the backscattered Ly-\u03b1 radiation at 1 AU as functions of the line-of-sight\nangle \u03b8. Plots A (top row) are for the total radiation scattered by both primary and\nsecondary interstellar atoms. Plots B (middle row) are for photons that were scattered by the primary interstellar atoms. Plots C (bottom row) correspond to the\nradiation scattered by the secondary interstellar atoms. Different curves correspond\nto three models of the hydrogen distributions in the heliosphere: (1) is the one-component hot model (model 1); (2) is the two-component hot model (model 2) ; (3)\nis our model (model 3) that takes into account effects of the heliospheric interface;\nadditional curves marked as 2a in plots A,B,C correspond to model of H atoms\ndescribed in this section, it is model 2a that is equal to model 2 plus \u03b8-dependence\nof hydrogen parameters at the outer boundary.\n\nalthough there is a difference of 20 rayleigh for the upwind direction. It means\nthat the main difference of models 2 and 3 is due to non-uniform flow of H\natoms at 90 AU in model 3. However, still there is a smaller difference due\nto non-Maxwellian behavior of the velocity distribution function at 90 AU\n10\n\n\f(which is taken into account only in model 3).\nAt first view, it is not evident why the angle dependence of the H atom\nparameters at 90 AU would strongly influence the backscattered Ly-\u03b1 emission\nmeasured at 1 AU. It is especially so, because the main emissivity region for\nthe backscattered Ly-\u03b1 radiation at 1 AU is located approximately at 2 AU for\nthe upwind line-of-sight and at 7 AU for downwind. From the simple (naive)\nconsideration one could expect that the most of H atoms in the regions close\nto the Sun would arrive from upwind. However, Lallement & Bertaux (1990)\nhave shown (in the case of the hot model) that the most of the atoms arrive\ninto the vicinity of the Sun not from upwind. The same is true for our model.\nTo illustrate this we calculate function n(ri , \u03b8b ) for two points (i=1,2) inside\nthe maximum emissivity region. Point 1 is located in the upwind direction at\n2 AU from the Sun. Point 2 is located in the downwind direction at 7 AU\nfrom the Sun. The function n(ri , \u03b8b ) represents the contribution to the total\nnumber density at a given point (point 1 for curve 1 in Fig. 4 A and point 2\nfor curve 2) from those particles that cross the outer boundary of 90 AU at\n\u03b8 = \u03b8b . This function n(ri , \u03b8b ) is defined as follows (for certainty we present\nall formulas only for point 1):\nn(r1 , \u03b8b ) =\n\nZ\n\n\u03a91\n\nf (r1 , w1 )dw1\n\n(4)\n\nHere f is the velocity distribution function of H atom. The integration is\nperformed over those w1 that correspond to the trajectories crossing the outer\nsphere of 90 AU at \u03b8 = \u03b8b . Here for simplicity we consider a balance between\nthe solar gravitation and radiation pressure (\u03bc = 1). This means that all\natom's trajectories are straight lines. In this case subspace \u03a91 is a cone with\napex angle equal to \u03b81 as it is seen from Fig. 3. Let us introduce a spherical\ncoordinate system in the velocity space. It means that we describe velocity\nvector w by its module w\u0303 and two spherical angles \u03b8\u0303 and \u03c6\u0303, i.e. orthogonal\ncoordinates of vector w can be represented as follows:\n\uf8f1\nw\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 x\n\n= w\u0303 * sin(\u03b8\u0303) * cos(\u03c6\u0303)\n\nwy = w\u0303 * sin(\u03b8\u0303) * sin(\u03c6\u0303)\n\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\n(5)\n\nwz = \u2212w\u0303 * cos(\u03b8\u0303)\n\nIn spherical coordinates dw1 = w\u030312 sin(\u03b8\u0303) dw\u03031 d\u03b8\u0303 d\u03c6\u0303. For velocities from the\nsubspace \u03a91 : \u03b8\u0303 = \u03b81 = const for chosen value of \u03b8b and integration over \u03b8\u0303 is\nnot needed. Hence, for our case integral (4) can be rewritten in the following\nform:\nn(r1 , \u03b8b ) =\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n+\u221e\n\nZ\n\n2\u03c0\n0\n\nf (r1 , w\u03031 , \u03b8\u0303 = \u03b81 , \u03c6\u0303) w\u030312 sin(\u03b81 ) dw\u03031 d\u03c6\u0303.\n\n11\n\n(6)\n\n\fFigure 3. Schematic picture of penetration of the hydrogen atoms from the outer\nboundary to the vicinity of the Sun. Point 1 (r1 ) is located in the upwind direction\nat 2 AU from the Sun. In the case of straight atom's trajectories we consider only\nthose atoms that arrive to point 1 from the outer boundary at \u03b8b . Angle \u03b81 can be\ndetermined if we know r1 and \u03b8b .\n\nNow, in the case of \u03bc = 1:\nf (r1 , w\u03031 , \u03b81 , \u03c6\u0303) = fb (\u03b8b , w\u03031 , \u03b81 , \u03c6\u0303) * exp(\u2212A(r1 , \u03b8b , w\u03031 )),\nwhere fb is a corresponding velocity distribution function at 90 AU, A is the\nloss of hydrogen atoms along its trajectory from the outer boundary to point\n1 due to ionization processes and \u03b81 = \u03b81 (\u03b8b ). fb does not depend on angle \u03c6\u0303\ndue to axial symmetry of the boundary conditions. Therefore expression (6)\ncan be represented as:\nn(r1 , \u03b8b ) =\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n+\u221e\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n2\u03c0\n\nfb (\u03b8b , w\u03031 , \u03b81 (\u03b8b )) exp(\u2212A(r1 , \u03b8b , w\u03031)) w\u030312 sin(\u03b8\u03031 ) dw\u03031 d\u03c6\u0303 =\n\n= 2\u03c0 sin(\u03b81 ) *\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n+\u221e\n\nfb (\u03b8b , w\u03031, \u03b81 (\u03b8b )) exp(\u2212A(r1 , \u03b8b , w\u03031 )) w\u030312 dw\u03031 =\n\n= 2\u03c0 sin(\u03b81 ) * g(r1 , \u03b8b ).\nFunction fb (\u03b8b , w\u03031 ) decreases with \u03b8b for each given value of w\u03031 , because\nat 90 AU Vz,H \u226b V\u03c1,H and distribution function has a maximum in the upwind direction. Loss-function A(r1 , \u03b8b , w\u03031 ) increases with \u03b8b for point 1 because\nlength of the trajectory has a minimal value in upwind and exp(\u2212A) decreases\nwith \u03b8b . Hence, function g(r1 , \u03b8b ) decreases with \u03b8b . And sin(\u03b81 ) increases with\n\u03b8b for \u03b8b \u2208 [0, \u03c0/2]. Therefore n(r1 , \u03b8b ) that is a product of sin(\u03b81 ) and g(r1 , \u03b8b )\n12\n\n\fFigure 4. Contributions to the total number density (A) and radial velocity (B)\nof atoms arrived from various directions. Curve 1 in plot A corresponds to point 1\n(r = 2 AU, \u03b8=0\u25e6 ), and curve 2 corresponds point 2 (r = 7 AU, \u03b8=180\u25e6 ). Contribution to the radial velocity was calculated only for point 2. Different curves in plot B\ncorrespond to different models of hydrogen distribution: solid line is model 3, dashed\nline is model 2 and dashed-dot line is model 1. All calculations are performed for\nthe mixture of primary and secondary interstellar atoms.\n\nshould have a maximum for some \u03b8b between 0\u25e6 and 90\u25e6 .\nFig. 4 A shows n(ri , \u03b8b ) calculated numerically for point 1 in upwind (curve 1)\nand for point 2 in downwind (curve 2). It is seen that the most part of the\ninterstellar atoms arrive to the point 1 from \u03b8 \u2248 15\u25e6 and to the point 2 from\n\u03b8 \u2248 55\u25e6 . Therefore, contrary to the simple consideration the most of H atoms\narrive to the vicinity of the Sun not exactly from upwind.\nNow, it is clear that the excess in the backscattered Ly-\u03b1 intensity in models 1 and 2 as compared with the model 3 is connected with larger number\ndensities of H atoms inside the heliosphere in models 1 and 2 due to non varying with \u03b8 boundary conditions while in model 3 the number density at 90\nAU decreases with \u03b8.\nIt also becomes clear why the intensities (and line-shifts) of the radiation\nscattered by the primary interstellar atoms are in agreement for all models\n(Fig. 2 B). This is because on the one hand, angle-dependence of hydrogen\nparameters at 90 AU for the primary interstellar atoms is weaker than for the\nsecondary interstellar atoms, and on the other hand, distribution function of\nprimary interstellar atoms is closer to Maxwellian than distribution function\nof secondary interstellar atoms.\nFrom the middle column of Fig. 2 (A,C) it is seen that there are noticeable\n13\n\n\fdifferences in the line-shifts of models 2 and 3 in the downwind direction.\nThe differences are seen for the total radiation as well as for the radiation\nscattered by the secondary interstellar atoms. At the same time there is almost\nno discrepancies in line-shifts of model 1 and model 3. In spite of model 1 is\nthe simplest model without any effects of the heliospheric interface, and one\ncould expect the difference.\nIn order to understand these results we computed the contribution to the\ntotal radial velocity of hydrogen at point 2 (7 AU in downwind) from the\nparticles that reach this point from the different directions. Similar to n(ri , \u03b8b )\ncontribution to the radial velocity can be calculated as follows:\nZ\n1\nVr (ri , \u03b8b ) = R +\u221e\n*\nf (ri , wi ) wi,r dwi\n\u03a9i\n\u2212\u221e f (ri , wi )dwi\n\nFig. 4 B shows Vr (ri , \u03b8b ), calculated at point 2 for different models. It is seen\nthat the maximum of Vr (ri , \u03b8b ) is located approximately at \u03b8=45\u25e6 for all models. However, model 2 (dashed curve in Fig. 3 B) has a non-negligible contribution of the negative values of Vr (ri , \u03b8b ) for \u03b8 > 100\u25e6 . The negative values of\nVr (ri , \u03b8b ) are due to relatively hotter secondary interstellar atoms in the downwind hemisphere (due to large temperature of secondary interstellar atoms and\nabsence of decrease of the number density from upwind to downwind in model\n2), which can reach point 2 from large values of angle \u03b8. This makes the total\nline-shift of model 2 in the downwind region smaller as compared with models\n1 and 3. Contributions of negative Vr (ri , \u03b8b ) in model 1 and model 3 are smaller\nthan in model 2 but due to different reasons. In model 3 the contribution of\nthe particles with negative Vr (ri , \u03b8b ) are significantly reduced because of small\nnumber density of such particles at the outer boundary that follows from the\nself-consistent model results. As for model 1 we do not see this effect due to\nrelatively smaller temperature of the mixture of primary and secondary interstellar atoms as compared with the temperature of the secondary interstellar\natoms which exist in model 2.\nNow let us consider the line-width of the Ly-\u03b1 (right column in Fig. 2).\nPlot A demonstrates that there are essential qualitative differences in the linewidths calculated on the basis of the three models. Model 1 shows a monotonic\nincrease of the line-width with the angle \u03b8. Model 2 shows a minimum of the\nline-width at \u03b8 \u223c60\u25e6 . Model 3 shows a small local maximum at \u03b8 \u223c150\u25e6 . These\nresults demonstrate that the line-width of the backscattered Ly-\u03b1 profiles is\nvery sensitive to the properties of hydrogen distribution at the entrance to\nthe heliosphere. In the next section we will focus on understanding of these\nqualitative differences and will show that the main causes of the difference\nare in kinetic non-Maxwellian nature of the hydrogen velocity distribution\nfunction at 90 AU. Note also, that for the line-widths the simplified model\n2a results are close to model 3 in the upwind hemisphere. However, large\ndiscrepancies in the downwind region still take place.\n14\n\n\fNow we will consider the differences in the line-widths of the backscattered\nspectra calculated separately for the primary and secondary populations of H\natoms (right columns in Fig. 2 B,C). For both populations we see the large\nmaxima of the line-widths at \u03b8 \u223c 90\u25e6 in the results of model 3. Such strong\nmaxima do not exist for model 2 and for model 2a. The latter means that the\nmaxima are not due to \u03b8-dependence of hydrogen parameters at 90 AU but\ndue to non-Maxwellian velocity distribution function at the outer boundary.\nNamely, as it was shown by Baranov et al. (1998) (see also, Izmodenov et\nal., 2001, and Fig. 3 e,f in Katushkina and Izmodenov, 2010) components Tz\nand T\u03c1 of the kinetic temperatures calculated from the velocity distribution\nR\nR\nfunction (i.e. Tz (r) \u223c f (r, w)*(Vz (r)\u2212wz )2 dw and T\u03c1 (r) \u223c f (r, w)*(V\u03c1(r)\u2212\nw\u03c1 )2 dw) are essentially different. In other words the mean thermal velocities\nof the H atoms are different in different directions. Moreover this difference\nbetween Tz and T\u03c1 temperatures increases approaching to the Sun due to\nlocal effects. The large maxima of the line-widths at \u03b8 = 90\u25e6 (Fig. 2 B,C) are\nconnected with the changes of the radial kinetic temperature Tr of H atoms\nat 90 AU as a function of \u03b8. For example, when observer looks toward upwind\n(i.e. \u03b8 = 0\u25e6 ) Tr =Tz , for the line-of-sight of \u03b8 = 90\u25e6 Tr =T\u03c1 and for line-ofsight of \u03b8 = 180\u25e6 Tr =Tz again. In model 3 at the outer boundary T\u03c1 is larger\nthan Tz for each of the interstellar populations of H atoms (that follows from\nBaranov-Malama model results). This leads to the maxima of Tr at \u03b8 = 90\u25e6\nand that are reflected in the maxima of the line-widths for photons scattered\nby each population of interstellar H atoms separately.\n\nFinally, to qualify the differences in the Ly-\u03b1 intensities, line-shifts and\nline-widths calculated by making use of models 1-3 we present Table 1 that\nshows differences (absolute and relative) between the model results for the\nupwind (\u03b8 = 0\u25e6 ), crosswind (\u03b8 = 90\u25e6 ) and downwind (\u03b8 = 180\u25e6 ) directions.\nIt is seen that one-component hot model 1 gives from 2 % (in upwind) to\n24 % (in downwind) differences with model 3 in intensities and about 10-18 %\ndifferences in the line-widths. Two-component hot model 2 leads to 8-27 %\ndiscrepancies with model 3 in the intensities, and from 10 % (in upwind) to\n40 % (in downwind) discrepancies in the line-widths. The differences in the\nline-shifts of models 1 and 2 relative to model 3 are large especially for the\ncrosswind direction. However, they are connected with the small values of the\nline-shifts and most probably can not be detected experimentally.\n\nIn the next section we discuss nature of the dependence of the Ly-\u03b1 linewidths on the angle \u03b8.\n15\n\n\fTable 1\nThe comparison of intensities, line-shifts and line-widths of the backscattered Ly\u03b1 radiation for three considered models of the hydrogen distribution inside the\nheliosphere (description of the models see in text)\n\u03b8 = 0\u25e6\n\n|Ilos \u2212Ilos,3 |\nIlos,3\n\n|Vlos \u2212Vlos,3 |\nVlos,3\n\n|Tlos \u2212Tlos,3 |\nTlos,3\n\nIlos (R)\n\nVlos (km/s)\n\nTlos (K)\n\nmodel 1\n\n677\n\n-24.2\n\n14 710\n\n2.3\n\n1.2\n\n14.5\n\nmodel 2\n\n720\n\n-24.5\n\n14 158\n\n8.7\n\n0.0\n\n10.3\n\nmodel 3\n\n662\n\n-24.5\n\n12 841\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n\u03b8 = 90\u25e6\n\nIlos (R)\n\nVlos (km/s)\n\nTlos (K)\n\nmodel 1\n\n398\n\n-0.9\n\n17 505\n\n4.7\n\n200.0\n\n18.0\n\nmodel 2\n\n421\n\n-0.6\n\n15 561\n\n10.8\n\n100.0\n\n4.9\n\nmodel 3\n\n380\n\n-0.3\n\n14 834\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n\u03b8 = 180\u25e6\n\nIlos (R)\n\nVlos (km/s)\n\nTlos (K)\n\nmodel 1\n\n127\n\n20.3\n\n18 984\n\n24.5\n\n1.4\n\n11.3\n\nmodel 2\n\n129\n\n17.4\n\n23 946\n\n26.5\n\n15.5\n\n40.4\n\nmodel 3\n\n102\n\n20.6\n\n17 060\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n5\n\n|Ilos \u2212Ilos,3 |\nIlos,3\n\n|Ilos \u2212Ilos,3 |\nIlos,3\n\n* 100%\n\n* 100%\n\n* 100%\n\n|Vlos \u2212Vlos,3 |\nVlos,3\n\n|Vlos \u2212Vlos,3 |\nVlos,3\n\n* 100%\n\n* 100%\n\n* 100%\n\nLine-width of the backscattered Ly-\u03b1 profiles as diagnostics of\nthe heliospheric interface nature\n\nCosta et al. (1999) and Quemerais et al. (2006) have analyzed spectral properties of the backscattered solar Ly-\u03b1 radiation measured by SOHO/SWAN in\n1996-2003. The Ly-\u03b1 line-width as function of the line-of-sight direction was\nstudied. It was shown that there is a noticeable minimum of the line-width\nat \u03b8 = 50\u25e6 \u2212 60\u25e6 . This minimum was interpreted as the indication of the two\n(primary and secondary) components of the interstellar H atoms in the heliosphere and, therefore, as an evidence of the heliospheric interface. Indeed, the\nresults obtained in the frame of the one-component classical hot model show\n(dashed-dot curve on Fig. 2A) the monotonic increase of the line-width from\nupwind to downwind. Existence of the two components, which have the bulk\nvelocities shifted one with respect to other, can help to produce the minimum\nof the temperature in the directions close to the crosswind direction.\nModels 2 and 3 considered in this paper have the two-components of H\natoms at the outer boundary at 90 AU. Therefore, one can expect that the\nminimum of the line-widths should be obtained in these models. However, as\nit is seen from Fig. 2 A the minimum is seen only for model 2 and not seen\n16\n\n|Tlos \u2212Tlos,3 |\nTlos,3\n\n|Tlos \u2212Tlos,3 |\nTlos,3\n\n* 100%\n\n* 100%\n\n* 100%\n\n\fFigure 5. Results of test calculations of the Ly-\u03b1 line-width as a function of the\nangle \u03b8. Results based on the one-component hot model (model 1 curve 1) and\nthe two-component hot model (model 2 curves 2 and 2b) are shown in plot (A)\nand results based on model 3 (curves 3, 3b, 3c) are shown in plot (B). Curves 2\nand 2b correspond to calculations based on model 2 with and without ionization,\nrespectively; curve 3 corresponds to model 3, and curve 3b and 3c are the results of\nmodel 3 where the ionization was switched off; in all calculations except model 3c\nsolar spectrum from Lemaire et al. (1998) was assumed, for model 3c the flat solar\nspectrum was employed. Also see Table 2.\n\nfor model 3. Instead, for model 3 we see a small maximum of the temperature\nat \u03b8 = 150\u25e6. In order to explain these features we have performed series of\nadditional test calculations.\nOur goal is to understand and distinguish roles of different effects influencing the line-width of the Ly-\u03b1 profiles. To do that we studied the effects of all\npossible model parameters and established that the following factors influence\nthe dependence of the line-width (Tlos ) on the angle \u03b8:\n1. Ionization processes that change the parameters of H atoms near the Sun.\nFrom our test calculations we found that the solar gravitation and radiation\npressure have smaller influence on the line-width than ionization.\n2. Existence of the two populations of the interstellar hydrogen atoms that\nare shifted in velocity space. This effect leads to appearance of the minimum\nof Tlos at \u03b8 = 90\u25e6 as it was discussed before.\n3. Non-Maxwellian behavior of the velocity distribution function of the two\npopulations at 90 AU. More precisely, the large difference between Tz and\nT\u03c1 \"temperature\" components (z and \u03c1 are cylindrical coordinates). This\neffect takes place for model 3.\n4. Shape of the solar spectrum of the Ly-\u03b1 radiation. It will be shown below\nthat the shape of the solar spectrum has some small but interesting effect\non the line-width as function of \u03b8.\n17\n\n\fFig. 5 summaries the results of test-calculations (see, also, table 2 for model\nnumeration) and explore the listed above effects. For all calculations of this\nsection we assume the solar gravitation force to be in balance with the solar\nradiation, i.e. the parameter \u03bc = 1 and the trajectories of the H atoms are\nstraight lines. To explore the effects of ionization in the vicinity of the Sun we\nperformed test calculations with typical ionization rate of \u03b2E = 5.9 * 10\u22127 s\u22121\nas well as the calculations with \u03b2E = 0 (models 2b, 3b, 3c).\nTable 2\nParameters of the test calculations\nModel description\n\ncurve's number\non fig. 5\n\n1\n\none-component model (1)\n\n2\n\ntwo-component model (2)\n\n2b\n\ntwo-component model (2) without ionization\n\n3\n\nour model (3)\n\n3b\n\nour model (3) without ionization\n\n3c\n\nour model (3) without ionization; flat solar spectrum of the Ly-\u03b1 radiation\n\nThe effects of the local ionization on the function of Tlos (\u03b8) are clearly illustrated in the frame of the one-component hot model 1 (curve 1 in Fig. 5 A)\nsince neither two-component nor non-Maxwellian effects are taken into account\nin this model. The line-width increases monotonically from the upwind direction to downwind. Such a behavior of the line-width of the backscattered Ly-\u03b1\nprofile reflects the properties of the H atom distribution since the ionization\n(due to so-called selection effect) leads to decrease of effective temperature of\nH atoms in upwind and increase of the temperature in the downwind direction\n(see for example Fig. 3.5 in Izmodenov (2006)).\nResults of the two-component hot model 2b that does not account for\nionization (curve 2b on Fig. 5) illustrate the effect of the two populations\nof the interstellar H atoms. These two populations have different bulk velocities Vz (at 90 AU in the upwind direction: Vz,primary \u2248 \u221227 km/s and\nVz,secondary \u2248 \u221216 km/s) and rather small thermal velocities. Therefore in\nthe upwind and downwind directions (where Vr = \u00b1Vz ) the line-of-sight projections of the velocity distribution functions of the primary and secondary\ncomponents are overlap each other in the velocity space only partially. In the\ncrosswind direction Vr = V\u03c1 \u2248 0 for both primary and secondary interstellar\natoms. This means that in this direction the projections of the distribution\nfunctions on the radial line-of-sight overlap completely. That is why the radial temperature of the mixture of primary and secondary interstellar atoms\nis smaller in the crosswind direction than in the upwind and downwind directions. This minimum of the radial temperature of H atoms in crosswind is\n18\n\n\freflected in the Ly-\u03b1 line-widths as it is clearly seen from model 2b.\nResults of the two-component hot model (curve 2) where the ionization is\ntaken into account combine both the increase of Tlos from upwind to downwind due to ionization effect and the local minimum in crosswind due to two\npopulations of H atoms. Hence, a small minimum of Tlos at \u03b8=50-60\u25e6 is seen\nin curve 2.\nThe line-width obtained by making use of model 3 is presented in Fig. 5 B.\nNote that this model takes into account all considered effects of the heliospheric interface, namely: 1) two populations of interstellar H atoms, 2) \u03b8dependence of the hydrogen parameters at 90 AU, 3) non-Maxwellian features\nof the hydrogen velocity distribution function at the entrance to the heliosphere. In particular, differences between kinetic temperature's components\nTz and T\u03c1 play an important role.\nCurve 3c corresponds to the model 3c that does not take into account\nionization and in addition in model 3c we assume that the solar Ly-\u03b1 flux\ndoes not depend on frequency. Note that in all other models we use the shape\nof the solar spectrum from Lemaire et al. (1998).\nIt is seen that the effect of minimum in Tlos at \u03b8 = 90\u25e6 (due to two populations) practically disappears in model 3c, but still is visible. This practical\ndisappearance of the minimum is connected with the increase of the radial kinetic temperature Tr with increase \u03b8 at 90 AU. The effect of Tr increase with\n\u03b8 compensates the effect of the minimum of the radial hydrogen temperature\nin crosswind due to the two populations of H atoms. That is why the value\nof the minimum of the line-widths at \u03b8 = 90\u25e6 is much smaller for model 3c as\ncompared with model 2b.\nIt is interesting to note, that for model 3b (that is more realistic than model\n3c) local minimum of Tlos at \u03b8 = 90\u25e6 replaces by small maximum. This effect\nis due to shape of the solar spectrum. Remember, that in model 3c we use\nflat solar spectrum while in model 3b we use nonuniform solar spectra from\nLemaire et al. (1998).\nLet us return to model 3 without any additional assumptions. It is seen\n(curve 3) that there is no minimum of Tlos at 50-60\u25e6 at all in this case. But\nthere is a small maximum at \u03b8 = 150\u25e6. This maximum can be explained\nby \u03b8-dependence of the kinetic temperature Tr . The radial temperature of\nsum of the primary and secondary interstellar atoms is shown in Fig. 6 (plot\nA corresponds to model 2, plot B \u2013 to model 3). It is seen that in case of\nthe two-component hot model 2 ionization leads to maximum of the Tr in\ndownwind. For model 3 the maximum of Tr is located at about \u03b8 = 150\u25e6. This\neffect is reflected in the line-widths of Ly-\u03b1 radiation that is seen in curve 3\nof Fig. 5 B.\n19\n\n\fFigure 6.

We have\nfound out that imprints of the heliospheric interface in the H atom distribution\ninside the heliosphere have a strong influence on the Ly-\u03b1 parameters.\nWe considered the minimum of the line-width of the backscattered Ly-\u03b1\nradiation at 50-60\u25e6 from upwind that was observed by SWAN (Costa et al.,\n1999; Quemerais et al., 2006). In the experimental data the line-width in the\ndirections of \u03b8 =50-60\u25e6 is smaller than in the upwind direction by 1500-2000 K.\nThis minimum is seen for 1996 and 1997 and practically is not seen for 20022003 years although data points for small angles are absent for this period (see\nQuemerais et al., 2006, Fig. 7). This minimum was explained (see Costa et al.,\n1999; Quemerais et al., 2006) by existence of the two different populations of\nthe interstellar hydrogen atoms that are shifted in velocity space. However, we\nnoticed that the line-width calculated with 2D stationary Baranov-Malama\nmodel (Quemerais & Izmodenov, 2002) has no any minimum of Tlos . Nonstationary 2D Baranov-Malama model (Quemerais et al., 2008) predicts small\nminimum in 2003, but there is no minimum in 1997.\nIn this work we theoretically explore the nature of the observed minimum\non the basis of three types of the hydrogen distribution inside the heliosphere.\nIt was shown that the minimum of the line-widths appears only for the twocomponent hot model, and there is no minimum at all for model 3 that takes\ninto account all effects of the heliospheric interface. It was found that the\nabsence of the minimum in model 3 is because the effect of the two components\n20\n\n\fis compensated by the non-Maxwellian features of the velocity distribution of\nH atoms at 90 AU after they passed the heliospheric interface region, namely,\nby strong anisotropy of the kinetic temperatures of H atoms (Tz < T\u03c1 ).\nTherefore, the question why the the minimum of the Ly-\u03b1 line-width exists\nin the experimental data remains to be open. Possibilities to get the minimum still exist in the frame of model 3. Firstly, models considered here does\nnot take into account the effects of latitudinal and solar cycle variations of\nthe photoionzation and charge exchange rates as well as the solar radiation\npressure. These local effects may potentially change the result of this paper.\nAnother possibility is to change the boundary conditions at 90 AU, i.e. to\nmake a change in the model of the heliospheric interface. For example, interstellar magnetic field may play a key role (Izmodenov et al., 2005). Another\npossibility is the multi-component nature of both the heliospheric and interstellar plasmas (Malama et al., 2006; Izmodenov et al., 2009; Chalov et al.,\n2010). In this non-equilibrium plasma model the interstellar pickup ions are\ntreated as the separate kinetic component. The plasma temperature in the\nvicinity of the heliopause is smaller in this model as compared with the\nBaranov-Malama model. Therefore, we could expect a decrease in the kinetic\ntemperatures of the secondary interstellar atoms. This might make larger velocity space separation of the primary and secondary interstellar atoms at\n90 AU. The separation may effectively increase the effect of the two populations as compared with the other effects. As the result one may hope that the\nobserved minimum will appear in the model.\nAll these possibilities will be checked in the nearest future.\nThis work was partially supported by RFBR grants 10-02-93113, 10-0201316 and \"Dynastia\" foundation.
