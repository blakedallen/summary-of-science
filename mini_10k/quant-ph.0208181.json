Rather than\nengineering a single Hamiltonian that evolves the system to a desired final sate, we implement a\ntechnique that applies a sequence of simple operations to synthesize the state.\nPACS numbers: 03.67.Lx, 32.80.Qk\n\nThe goal of deterministically synthesizing or \"engineering\" arbitrary states of a quantum system is at the heart\nof such diverse fields as quantum computation [1] and\nreaction control in chemistry [2]. For harmonic oscillator states, particular non-linear interactions can be used\nto generate special states such as squeezed states. However, it is intractable to realize a single interaction required to create an arbitrary state. Law and Eberly [3]\nhave devised a technique for arbitrary harmonic oscillator\nstate generation that couples the oscillator to a two-level\natomic or \"spin\" system and applies a sequence of operations that use simple interactions. We demonstrate this\ntechnique on the harmonic motion of a single trapped\n9\nBe+ ion and include the generation of arbitrary spinoscillator states [4]. Such quantum state control is relevant to the scheme for constructing a quantum computer\nusing trapped atomic ions [5, 6], where we must control\nthe quantized micro-mechanical system composed of the\ncollective ion normal modes that are used as a data bus\nto transfer information between the ion qubits. These\ntechniques could also be used to create input states for\nquantum computing schemes that use continuous variables [7] including the code-words that are required for\nfault tolerant computation [8].\n\ncillator, then driving the |0i \u2194 |1i transition also induces\nsuccessive transitions |1i \u2194 |2i, |2i \u2194 |3i, etc. leading to\nfixed relations between the ci .\n\nArbitrary quantum state synthesis is difficult unless\ncertain conditions are met. As an example, consider\na simple quantum system with four energy eigenstates\nlabelled |0i, |1i, |2i, and |3i. If the system is initially prepared in |0i, and if couplings that create superpositions \u03b1i |0i + \u03b2i | ii (i = 1,2,3) can selectively be\nturned on, then we can create arbitrary superpositions of\nthe form c0 |0i + c1 |1i + c2 |2i + c3 |3i. Here, the ci are\ncomplex\nP and subject to the usual normalization condition i |ci |2 = 1. This method could be realized in an\natomic system if the four states were non-degenerate levels with different energy separations and coherent transitions |0i \u2194 |ii could be driven by applied radiation.\nThese requirements are not often met in practice. For\nexample, it may be impossible to realize all of the desired\ncouplings |0i \u2194 |ii. Also, if the eigenstates are equally\nspaced like the first four energy levels of a harmonic os-\n\nConsider an auxiliary system consisting of two internal states of an atom which we label |\u2193i and |\u2191i in analogy with the two-level system resulting from a spin-1/2\nmagnetic moment in a magnetic field. In practice, the\nharmonic oscillator could correspond to a single mode\nof the radiation field [3] or the mechanical oscillation\nof a trapped atom [4, 15]. The combined energy levels for this system are depicted in Fig. 1. As an example,\nP we summarize the procedure to create the state\n|\u2193i i=0...3 c\u2193i |ii starting from the ground state |\u2193i |0i.\nIt is simplest to first think about solving the inverse\nproblem P\n[3]: creating the state |\u2193i |0i from the initial\nstate |\u2193i i=0...3 c\u2193i |ii. The procedure begins by applying a resonant pulse of radiation that carries out a \"\u03c0pulse\" |\u2193i |3i \u2192 |\u2191i |2i leaving no amplitude in the |\u2193i |3i\nstate (\"clearing it out\") and placing amplitude c\u21933 in the\n|\u2191i |2i state. Applying this radiation also causes transi-\n\nIt has long been recognized that certain interactions\ncan cause harmonic oscillators to evolve to particular\ndesired states [9]. For example, if the oscillator is excited from its ground state with the nonlinear force\nF0 z cos(2\u03c9t) then a \"vacuum-squeezed\" state is created.\nSuch states can be used to increase measurement precision in specific applications such as interferometry [10].\nHowever, it is usually intractable to find the desired force\nor interaction that will create a state with arbitrary coefficients. To circumvent this problem, schemes have\nbeen proposed [11, 12] that sequentially couple atomic\nsuperposition states to the field of a cavity mode and\nstatistically prepare arbitrary field states through projective measurements. An alternative method has been\nproposed to deterministically map a previously prepared\nsuperposition of atomic Zeeman states onto the field of\na cavity [13]. A more general deterministic scheme to\nprepare arbitrary field states has been suggested by Law\nand Eberly [3, 14]. The idea relies on coupling the harmonic oscillator to an auxiliary two-level quantum system through a sequence of simple interactions.\n\n\f2\ntions between other states |\u2193i |ni and |\u2191i |n \u2212 1i. Because\nin general the coherent transition rates (Rabi rates) are\nnot the same for different values of n [16], in this first\nstep the amplitudes of the other states change according to c\u2193n |\u2193i |ni \u2192 c\u2032\u2193n |\u2193i |ni + d\u2032\u2191,n\u22121 |\u2191i |n \u2212 1i. The\nLaw/Eberly method succeeds because the state |\u2193i |0i remains unaffected since the state |\u2191i |\u22121i does not exist.\nThe second step is to induce the transition\nc\u21933 |\u2191i |2i + c\u2032\u21932 |\u2193i |2i \u2192 c\u2032\u2032\u21932 |\u2193i |2i, thereby clearing out\nthe |\u2191i |2i state. The duration and phase of the second pulse are chosen according to the known values of\nc\u21933 and c\u2032\u21932 in order to collapse the superposition state.\nThe first two steps have cleared out the |\u2193i |3i and |\u2191i |2i\nstates but, in general, non-zero amplitudes remain in the\n|\u2191i |0i, |\u2191i |1i, |\u2193i |0i, |\u2193i |1i, and |\u2193i |2i states. However, by repeating this two-step clearing-out process for\nsuccessively lower values of n, the state amplitudes are\ntransferred down the dual ladder of states eventually to\nthe ground state |\u2193i |0i. Finally, to achieve the original goal, we apply these same steps in aP\ntime-reversed\nfashion to carry out the mapping to |\u2193i i=0...3 c\u2193i |ii.\nIn the experiments described below, we demonstrate\nthe Law/Eberly technique by implementing the mapping\n|\u2193i |0i \u2192 |\u2193i (|0i + |3i)Pand other intermediate mappings\nof the form |\u2193i |0i \u2192 i (c\u2193i |\u2193i + c\u2191i |\u2191i) |ii [4].\n\n|1\u00f1\n\n|0\u00f1\n6\n\n1.08p\n\n|0\u00f1\n\n5\n\n} |-\u00f1\n\np\n\np\n\n1.25p\n\n|3\u00f1\n\n|2\u00f1\n1\n3\n\n2\n\n4\n\n1.44p\n\n|1\u00f1\n\np\n\n|2\u00f1\n\n|3\u00f1\n\n}| \u0304\u00f1\n\nFIG. 1: Schematic energy level diagram for the combined\nharmonic oscillator/spin-1/2 system (only harmonic oscillator\nlevels with n \u2264 3 are shown).

The laser pulses are applied in a\nstepwise fashion (labelled from 1 to 6) where the pulse areas\n\u03a9n,n\u2032 t (marked next to the head of each arrow) are calculated\naccording to the Rabi rate for the numbered transitions. In\nthis notation, a \"\u03c0-pulse\" would completely transfer all of\nthe population from an initial state |\u2193i |ni to a final state\n|\u2191i |n\u2032 i, for example. To generate |\u03a803 i from |\u2193i |0i, the pulse\nsequence shown here is applied in a time-reversed manner.\n\nThe harmonic oscillator and auxiliary levels in our experiment correspond to the motional and internal states\nof a single 9 Be+ atomic ion trapped in a linear Paul\ntrap [17]. We use the harmonic oscillator motional states\nalong the trap axis (z direction) which are equally spaced\nin energy by h \u00d7 (2.9 MHz), where h is Planck's constant. In this direction, the ion is confined by a static\nelectric harmonic potential. The |\u2191i and |\u2193i (auxiliary)\nspin states are the F = 1, mF = \u22121 and F = 2, mF = \u22122\n\nhyperfine levels of the ion's 2 S1/2 electronic ground\nstate, which are separated in energy by approximately\nh \u00d7 (1250 MHz). Applied laser radiation is used for state\npreparation and manipulation. A pair of laser beams\ndetuned by approximately +80 GHz from the 2 S1/2 to\n2\nP1/2 electronic transition (\u03bb \u223c 313 nm) drives coherent Raman transitions and couples the |\u2191i and |\u2193i states\nand motional levels [6, 18]. Motion sensitive coupling\nis produced using non-collinear beams with a wavevector difference along z. The Raman laser beam frequency difference is tuned to drive |\u2191i |n \u2212 \u2206ni \u2194 |\u2193i |ni\nor |\u2191i |ni \u2194 |\u2193i |ni transitions, and the coherent transition rate, or Rabi frequency, depends on both n and \u2206n\n[16, 19]. The experimental observable is the atomic spin\nstate which we detect through state-dependent resonance\nfluorescence measurements at the end of every experiment [6, 20].\nTo demonstrate the Law/Eberly scheme, we\nconfigure the apparatus\nto generate the state\n\u221a\n|\u03a803 i = |\u2193i (|0i + |3i) / 2 from |\u2193i |0i using only\ntransitions |\u2191i |n \u2212 \u2206ni \u2194 |\u2193i |ni where \u2206n alternates\nbetween 0 and 1. The ion is initialized in the |\u2193i |0i state\nwith greater than 99.9% probability using stimulated\nRaman cooling and optical pumping [21]. The six steps\nrequired to carry out the reverse process (produce |\u2193i |0i\nfrom |\u03a803 i) are calculated according to the step-wise\nalgorithm and are shown in Fig. 1.\nThe state created after applying the Law/Eberly\nscheme is analyzed through measurements of Rabi oscillations on the |\u2193i |ni \u2194 |\u2191i |n + \u2206ni, \u2206n=0,\u00b11 transiP\n2\ntions [18, 22]. The probability P\u2193 = i |c\u2193i | to detect\nthe ion in the |\u2193i state is recorded after applying a laser\npulse on one of these transitions for duration t. The observed oscillations (see Fig. 3) of P\u2193 as a function of the\nlaser pulse duration are fit to a sum of cosine functions\nwith Rabi frequencies \u03a9n,n+\u2206n (= \u03a9n+\u2206n,n ) constrained\nby the measured ratio of Rabi frequencies for the different motional levels [23]. The amplitude and phase (left as\nfree parameters in the fit) of each frequency component\n2\n2\nare used to determine the probabilities |c\u2191i | and |c\u2193i | for\ni = 0, 1, 2, 3 [24]. We find that the observed ion population corresponds to the target state with 0.89 probability\n(Table 1), and that the populations in |\u2193i |0i and |\u2193i |3i\nare equal within the 0.03 measurement uncertainty.\n2\n2\nThe probabilities |c\u2191i | and |c\u2193i | are also measured\nafter each step in the procedure to generate |\u03a803 i and\nare compared to the theoretical predictions in Fig. 3.\nThe Hilbert space trajectory from the initial to final\nstate is somewhat complicated, with probability appearing, at least temporarily, in the |\u2193i |n = 0, 1, 2, 3i and\n|\u2191i |n = 0, 1, 2i states.\nThe Rabi oscillation diagnostic determines the\n2\n2\npopulations |c\u2191i | and |c\u2193i | , but gives no information about the phase relation between the states.\nFor example, measuring the populations in this\n\n\f3\n\n1.0\n\nc\n\n3\n\n0.8\n\nc\n\nP\n\n2\n\n0.6\n\nc\n\n1\n\n0.4\n\nc\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\nc\n0.0\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\nc\n\n3\n\n2\n\npulse length ( s)\nc\n\n1\n\n1\n\nFIG. 2: Measured Rabi oscillations for the target state\n|\u03a803 i.

This table shows the average of populations determined from using Rabi oscillation\nmeasurements employing couplings with \u2206n = 0, \u00b11.

The real\namplitudes c\u2193n and c\u2191n are shown for the sequence used to\ngenerate |\u03a803 i. The solid lines are the theoretical prediction,\nwhile the data (solid circles) are derived from the probabilities\n|c\u2193i |2 and |c\u2191i |2 measured using the Rabi oscillation technique\nafter each step. The amplitude was determined by taking\nthe square root of the measured probability and assigning a\nsign consistent with the final state and the length of the laser\npulses.\n\nthe |\u03a803 i sequence were used to generate |\u03a8T i. The\nmeasured probabilities for the experimentally generated\nstate were |c\u21930 |2 = 0.39, |c\u21912 |2 = 0.55, |c\u21910 |2 = 0.03, and\n0.03 distributed among the remaining states.\nA coherent analysis pulse was applied on\n|\u2191i |n + 2i \u2194 |\u2193i |ni transitions after the |\u03a8T i state\ngeneration pulses but before spin state detection. The\nlaser pulse area was adjusted to be a \"\u03c0/2\"-pulse for\nthe |\u2191i |2i \u2194 |\u2193i |0i transition. For the pure |\u03a8T i state,\nthe population would almost fully oscillate between the\nstates |\u2193i |0i and |\u2191i |2i as the phase of the analysis pulse\nwas varied relative to the state generation pulses. No\nsensitivity to this phase would be observed if the state\nwe generated was an incoherent mixture of populations\n(dashed line in Fig. 4). The measured probability to\nfind the atom in the state |\u2193i as the laser phase is swept\nis shown in Fig. 4. The amplitude of these oscillations\ncan be related to the fidelity\nF = h\u03a8T |\u03c1 |\u03a8T i\n\n= 0.41\u03c1\u21930\u21930 + 0.59\u03c1\u21912\u21912 + 0.495 (\u03c1\u21930\u21912 + \u03c1\u21912\u21930 )\n\nwhere \u03c1 is the experimentally measured density matrix.\nWe determine that F = 0.93 \u00b1 0.03 using the measured\npopulations and oscillation contrast to determine the relevant elements of the density matrix \u03c1 as in ref [25].\n\n\f4\n\u2020\n\n1.0\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\nP\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\nphase (deg)\n\nFIG. 4: Coherence fringes. After generation pulses for the\ntarget state 0.64 |\u2193i |0i + 0.77 |\u2191i |2i are implemented, a \"\u03c0/2\"\nanalysis laser pulse is applied with a controlled phase relative\nto the state generation pulses. Shown here are the resulting\noscillations in the probability P\u2193 to find the atom in the |\u2193i\nstate as the laser pulse phase is swept. The amplitude of the\noscillation determined from a fit to a cosine function (solid\nline) is used to establish the fidelity of the experimentally\ngenerated state. The oscillation centered around P\u2193 = 0.46 is\nconsistent with the measured probability in the |\u2191i |0i state\n(which is unaffected by the analysis laser coupling) and experimental error in the analysis laser pulse duration. The dashed\nline indicates the result if the prepared state is an incoherent\nmixture.\n\nIn summary, we have demonstrated experimentally the\nscheme of Law and Eberly [3] for generation of arbitrary\nharmonic-oscillator states and its extension [4] to arbitrary harmonic-oscillator/spin states. The method can\nbe generalized to higher dimensions [4], to the generation of arbitrary density matrices of harmonic oscillators\n[14], to the creation of arbitrary motional observables\n[15] such as the phase [26], and to the generation of arbitrary Zeeman state superpositions [27]. The precision\nwith which we can implement this technique has a direct\nrelation to the efficiency of quantum-information processing using trapped ions [5]. With sufficient improvements\nin the fidelity of such operations, one can contemplate using additional motional modes of motion as information\ncarriers in this scheme. Of course, the same techniques\ncan be applied in cavity-QED, the system in which it\nwas originally conceived [3]. More generally, such techniques increase the variety of tools available for quantuminformation processing and may eventually find application in areas not currently anticipated.\nWe thank D.

If other phases exist, the Rabi oscillation contrast\nis reduced and we underestimate the populations.
