L. Bogolubsky\n\n1. Introduction\nOver the last years interesting results in Landau gauge gluodynamics have been found for\ngluon and ghost propagators (and, consequently, for the running coupling) both within the semianalytical Dyson-Schwinger(DS) as well as Functional Renormalization Group (FRG) approaches\n[1, 2] and with the help of lattice computations [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. They have excited controversal\ndebates about the behaviour in the deep infrared (IR) region. Within the DS and FRG approach it\nwas demonstrated [2] that the behaviour strongly depends on the choice of the infrared limit of the\nghost dressing function taken as a boundary condition for solving the (truncated) system of equations. The so-called scaling solution exhibits an IR singular well-defined power-like behaviour of\nthe ghost dressing function and correspondingly a vanishing gluon propagator in agreement with\nthe quite attractive confinement scenarios invented some time ago by Gribov and Zwanziger on one\nhand and by Kugo and Ojima on the other. Moreover, it was in accordance with BRST invariance\nproperties.\nLattice results \u2013 as long as they are based on the assumption that one has to choose Gribov\ngauge copies as close as possible to the fundamental modular region \u2013 support with convincing\nnumerical evidence the so-called decoupling solution with finite IR limits of both the gluon propagator and the ghost dressing function. Revisiting the case of SU (2) lattice gauge theory we give\nhere further evidence for this observation by a consequent use of an efficient gauge fixing method,\nthe simulated annealing algorithm. Since previous lattice investigations of the IR limit both in\nSU (2) as well as in SU (3) were carried out at quite strong bare coupling values in order to reach\nlargest possible physical volumes the continuum limit was not really under control. Therefore, in\nthe given contribution to LATTICE '09 we have a look into the scaling properties of the gluon\npropagator, which seem to be a bit more involved in the SU (2) than in the SU (3) case. We neglect\nso-called SU (2)-flips which enlarge the class of Landau gauge orbits and allow to extremize the\ngauge functional even further.\n\n2. Landau gauge fixing, Gribov ambiguity and gluon propagator\nIn order to fix the gauge on the lattice we apply gauge transformations g(x) \u2208 G = SU (Nc ),\n(Nc = 2, 3) to sets {Ux,\u03bc } of link variables by mapping Ux,\u03bc \u2192 gUx,\u03bc = g(x)Ux,\u03bc g\u2020 (x + \u03bc\u0302 ) .\nThe set of all admissible {gUx,\u03bc } for a given field {Ux,\u03bc } is called a gauge orbit. The Landau\ngauge \u2202\u03bc A\u03bc = 0 for Ax+\u03bc\u0302 /2,\u03bc = (1/2 i a g0 )(Ux,\u03bc \u2212Ux,\u2020 \u03bc )traceless is fixed by searching for the local\nmaxima glmx (x) of the gauge functional\nFU [g] =\n\n1\nRe Tr gUx,\u03bc .\nNc \u2211\nx,\u03bc\n\n(2.1)\n\nIn general for non-Abelian groups G more than one local maximum glmx (x) can be found, the\nso-called Gribov copies. Since the values of the gauge functional FU [g] and other gauge-variant\nquantities O(gU ) computed for various Gribov copies typically are correlated, further clarification\nof the gauge fixing condition is required. In case of Landau (or Coulomb) gauges for SU (Nc ) gauge\ntheories it was proposed [8] to choose the global maximum ggmx (x) among all local ones, thus\nintroducing the fundamental modular region (FMR) inside the Gribov region, the latter defined\n2\n\n\fGluon propagator in SU2 LGT revisited\n\nI. L. Bogolubsky\n\nby the positivity region of the Faddeev-Popov operator [8]. In the present study we still keep the\nFMR condition. In practice it is hard - if not even impossible - to reach the FMR. Therefore, one\nis interested to improve the gauge fixing method and/or to apply the method of choice many times\nstarting from random gauges in order to find the \"best copies\" closest to the FMR.\nIn what follows we reconsider the question of how the gluon propagator depends on the Gribov ambiguity when the (Landau) gauge is fixed on a lattice. This question has been addressed\nfor relatively small lattice volumes already in preceding publications (e.g. in [9, 10, 11]). Note\nthat in previous papers, instead of a comparison between two different gauge-fixing techniques, a\ncomparison is made of the \"best copy\" (bc) with respect to the maximal FU [g] value achieved and\n\"first copy\" (fc), i.e. corresponding to a randomly chosen copy [10, 12]. In [11] \"worst\" copies\nwere used for comparison, as well. There a visible Gribov copy effect was reported for the gluon\npropagator in the infrared. However, the effect appeared to be much more pronounced, when (i)\nthe gauge orbit was extended by admitting nonperiodic (periodic up to Z(Nc )) gauge transformations (flips) and when (ii) the standard overrelaxation method (OR) was replaced by a simulated\nannealing algorithm (SA) - always followed by finalizing OR steps [13, 14, 15]. Moreover, the\nmore efficient gauge fixing approach (SA + flips) led to a suppression of finite-volume effects, and\nindications were found that the influence of flip transformations on the gluon propagator gradually\nweakens with increasing linear lattice size L. But all these results were obtained at rather small\nlattice volumes.\nIn the present study for SU (2) we neglect the flip gauge transformations and compare the SA\nmethod with the OR algorithm for strictly periodic gauge transformations. Our implementation of\nSA gauge fixing in the SU (2) case differs from that for SU (3) gluodynamics [6, 7] only in some\ntechnical details. We note that the \"temperature\" Tmax , from which SA cooling starts in the SU (2)\ncase, is chosen to be the \"critical\" value Tcr of some phase transformation [16, 7], which takes\nplace in the gauge-fixing field g(x) interacting with the Monte Carlo generated equilibrium field\nUx,\u03bc according to the gauge functional (2.1). For the SU (2) case it looks like a higher order phase\ntransition [16] or even like a \"crossover\". Anyhow, we have chosen Tmax = Tcr = 1.1 in most cases.\nSimulated annealing, also known as \"stochastic optimization method\" [17], in principle allows\ngetting arbitrarily close to the global maximum FU [ggmx ], if the number of SA \"cooling steps\" is\nlarge enough. This is the underlying idea of our \"single copy\" method successfully used in our\nSU (3) papers [6, 7]. In fact, in our SU (2) computations we have used long SA chains with O(104 )\nsteps from Tmax down to Tmin = 0.01 [6].\nThe comparison for the unrenormalized gluon propagator obtained with SA versus OR techniques on 804 lattices at \u03b2 = 2.30 is shown in Fig. 1, where we have plotted only results for momenta q2 surviving the so-called cylinder cut [18, 5]. One can clearly see a noticeable difference\nbetween SA and OR gluon propagator values in the deep infrared region q2 < 0.2GeV 2 , where the\nGribov effect leads to a qualitative change of the behaviour of the gluon propagator. The question\nremains, whether the Gribov copy effect for the gluon propagator weakens with a further increase\nof the lattice volume.\n\n3.

To our knowledge the continuum limit expressed in a proper scaling and a\nmultiplicative renormalization behaviour was not yet considered in detail on large volumes. We\nhave made a step into this direction again neglecting the influence of Z(2) flip transformations.\nWe have computed the gluon propagator on a sequence of lattices with increasing linear lattice\nsize L and \u03b2 , choosing (L, \u03b2 ) such that the physical volume was kept more or less constant. We\nhave produced equilibrium ensembles of MC configurations and fixed the Landau gauge with the\n(single-copy) SA method for: (L, \u03b2 ) = (40, 2.2), (56, 2.3), (80, 2.4), (112, 2.5), i.e. for a physical\nbox size of approximately 10 fm. The bare gluon propagator D(q2 ) for these pairs of parameters is\nshown in Fig. 2.\nThere are quite strong differences which have not been observed in the SU (3) case before.

In the continuum or scaling limit the bare propagator is expected\nto be multiplicative renormalizable as in perturbation theory. This means that between the results\nobtained at different lattice cutoffs a finite multiplicative renormalization up to lattice artifacts\nshould be possible. In a finite volume \u2013 unavoidable for any lattice results \u2013 the multiplicative\nrenormalization could be violated by finite-size effects.\nIn accordance with the standard momentum-subtraction (MOM) renormalization scheme we\nhave multiplicatively rescaled the bare gluon dressing functions Z(q2 , \u03b2 ) \u2261 q2 D(q2 ) (for all \u03b2 values considered) equating the renormalized values at some q = \u03bc to the tree-level value Zren (\u03bc 2 ) = 1.\nThe renormalization point was chosen at \u03bc 2 = 5.8 GeV2 , sufficiently far away from the cutoff\nmomentum q2max = 79.4 GeV2 for \u03b2 = 2.50. For illustration the finite renormalization factors\nZ(\u03bc 2 , \u03b2 )/Z(\u03bc 2 , \u03b2 = 2.5) are shown in the Table 1. They were obtained by interpolating between\nthe 7 data points closest to the chosen scale \u03bc for \u03b2 = 2.5.\nTable 1: Finite renormalization factors for \u03bc 2 = 5.8GeV2 .\n\n\u03b2\n2.2\n2.3\n2.4\n\nZ(\u03bc 2 , \u03b2 )/Z(\u03bc 2 , \u03b2 = 2.5)\n0.815\n0.8925\n0.9489\n\nThe MOM-renormalized dressing function is plotted in Fig. 3. One clearly sees that the three\ncurves for the renormalized dressing function Zren (q2 ) obtained at lattice sizes L = 56, 80, 112 lie\nnicely on top of each other, thus confirming the expected multiplicative renormalizability. For \u03b2 =\n2.2 and L = 40 there are some scaling violations that can be understood as lattice artifacts. Some\nslight variations of the curve obtained with the largest lattice L = 112 probably can be attributed to\nproblems with the still unsufficient Monte Carlo statistics and/or autocorrelations.\n\n4. Conclusions\nThe comparison of OR- and SA-based results for the gluon propagator for L = 80 and \u03b2 = 2.3\n5\n\n\fGluon propagator in SU2 LGT revisited\n\nI. L. Bogolubsky\n\nclearly shows a noticeable Gribov copy effect in the range of momenta q2 < 0.2GeV 2 . At the\nmoment the (dis)appearance of this effect for even larger volumes is an interesting open problem.\nAn open question is also, whether our results obtained on large volumes will be modified, when\nZ(2) flips are taken into account. This is a matter of research in a forthcoming papers of one of the\ncoauthors [19].\nUsing SA-based Landau gauge fixing we have got numerical confirmation for a nonperturbative multiplicative renormalizability for the gluon dressing function. Finite-size effects already\nseem to be negligible in the given range of momenta.\n\nReferences\n[1] Ph. Boucaud, J.P. Leroy, A. Le Yaouanc, J. Micheli, O. Pene, J.
