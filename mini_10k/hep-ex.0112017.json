The important features of \u1ebd\u00b1\nR,L production\nare used to design an experimentally robust method, with good resolution, both for determining\nthe \u1ebdR,L and the \u03c7\u030301 masses and for suppressing backgrounds. Additional features, such as the\ndetermination of the relative leptonic branching ratios of the selectron are present in the method.\nKeywords: SUSY Particle Production, Experimental Mass Determination, Selectron\n\nThe determination of Supersymmetric particle masses\nusing the energy end-point method [1] is well known. The\nmeasurement of selectron masses is subject to two experimental difficulties: on the one hand the energy distribution of the visible particles in the event is an overlap of 4\n\"box like\" distributions due to the production channels\n\u2212 + \u2212 + \u2212 + \u2212\n\u1ebd+\nR \u1ebdR , \u1ebdL \u1ebdL , \u1ebdR \u1ebdL , \u1ebdL \u1ebdR and on the other, the Supersymmetry (SUSY) signal is masked by very large Standard\nModel (SM) backgrounds, such as W+ W\u2212 and \u03b3 \u2217 \u03b3 \u2217 . The\nconsequences are, for the former the difficulty of resolving overlapping \"box\"-edges in the lower energy region\nmaking it hard to determine which edge is due to which\nSUSY particle decay, while for the latter the masking of\nthe SUSY-signal by large SM backgrounds.\nMany other studies [2\u20136] of the determination of supersymmetric masses via the energy spectrum of the observed particles have been carried out showing the usefulness of the technique and the levels of accuracy possible.\nThe complications in the selectron spectrum are being\nsolved here.\nDuring Snowmass-2001 we realised that the difference\nof the observed positron and electron (from the \u1ebdL,R decay) energy distributions enhanced by the difference in\ncross sections with incident electron polarization (possible only with a Linear Collider) can solve these problems\nand provide a method by which we can determine the\nmasses unambiguously with good resolution. In addition\nit offers new features, built in redundancy, the determination of the partial leptonic branching ratios to the\n\u00b1\n0\nchannels \u03c7\u0303\u00b1\n1 \u03bde and \u03c7\u03031 e. Information about the \u03c7\u03031 and\n\u00b1\n\u03c4\u03031 masses may, in principle, also be determined.\nThe e+ , e\u2212 energy distributions difference is given by:\n\nunity. The method presented here removes the contribution to the energy spectrum from the reactions producing\n\u2212\n+ \u2212\n\u1ebd+\nR \u1ebdR and \u1ebdL \u1ebdL , which solves the mass measurement difficulty and reduces the mass errors.\n\u00b1\nAsymmetric boosts are present when \u1ebd\u00b1\nL and \u1ebdR are\nproduced in the same reaction. The values of the boosts\nbeing in this case:\nM2 \u2212 M2\n1 \u221a\ns + \u1ebdL \u221a \u1ebdR\n2M\u1ebdL\n2M\u1ebdL s\nM2 \u2212 M2\n1 \u221a\ns + \u1ebdR \u221a \u1ebdL\n=\n2M\u1ebdR\n2M\u1ebdR s\n\n\u03b3\u1ebdL =\n\u03b3\u1ebdR\n\n(2)\n\nThe energies of the electron and positron which are the\nparticles visible in the event are related to the decay CM\nenergy. Since me \u226a ML,R we obtain the lower and higher\nbounds of the electron/positron energy distribution in\nthe LAB reference frame:\np\nEe\u00b1 (HI) = Ee\u2217\u00b1 (\u03b3 + \u03b3 2 \u2212 1)\np\np\nEe\u00b1 (LO) = Ee\u2217\u00b1 (\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b3 2 \u2212 1) = Ee\u2217\u00b1 /(\u03b3 + \u03b3 2 \u2212 1) (3)\nSolving for Ee\u2217\u00b1 and \u03b3 we obtain:\np\nEe\u2217\u00b1 = Ee\u00b1 (HI) * Ee\u00b1 (LO)\ns\nEe\u00b1 (HI)\n\u03bb\u00b1 =\nEe\u00b1 (LO)\n\n(4)\n\np\nwhere \u03bb = \u03b3 + \u03b3 2 \u2212 1, and \u03b3 = \u03bb/2 + 1/(2\u03bb). We can\ndetermine the relationship between the mass errors and\nthe energy-edge errors. To a very good approximation\nthis follows from:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03bb2\u1ebd\n\u2212 1 \u03b4\u03bb\u1ebdL,R\n\u03b4\u03b3\u1ebdL,R\n\u03b4M\u1ebdL,R\n(5)\n=\u2212\n= 2L,R\nM\u1ebdL,R\n\u03b3\u1ebdL,R\n\u03bb\u1ebdL,R + 1 \u03bb\u1ebdL,R\n\n\u2032\n\u2206(E) = Lumi * (\u03c3RL \u2212 \u03c3LR ) * [Rbox\n(E) \u2212 L\u2032box (E)] (1)\n\nwhere, for instance, \u03c3LR is the production cross section\n\u2212\n\u2032\n\u2032\nfor \u1ebd+\nL \u1ebdR , while R (E) and L (E) are the appropriate\nenergy box distributions (for the incident electron righthanded and left-handed polarization) each normalised to\n\nThis becomes to a good approximation\n1\n\n\f1 Ee (HI) \u2212 Ee (LO) \u03b4(Ee )\n\u03b4M\n= \u221a\nM\n2 Ee (HI) + Ee (LO) Ee\n\nthe edge-to-particle assignments are clear, the positive\npart of the distribution corresponding to \u1ebd\u00b1\nR . Thirdly,\nsince all SM backgrounds have the same energy distribution for the visible e+ and e\u2212 , their difference does\nnot exhibit any contribution from Standard Model backgrounds. Even if there is a detector asymmetry between\npositive and negative tracks, this is eliminated through\nthe use of the polarised version of the above difference as\ndescribed in eqn. 1 and shown in Fig. 1.\nIt should be noted also that even though the backgrounds are reduced to the level of their statistical fluctuations, they can still be large and affect the signal. Hence\nremoval of the background to first order by kinematical\ncuts or strategically located detector vetoes is still useful.\nIt has been shown [8] that the \u03b3 \u2217 \u03b3 \u2217 background can be\nsuppressed to almost zero using these techniques. These\n0\ncuts fail however when \u1ebd\u00b1\nL,R and \u03c7\u03031 are close in mass,\nfor this case a Very-Forward Veto device is crucial. The\nmethod proposed here greatly alleviates the kinematic\nseverity of the cuts needed to control this background.\n\n(6)\n\nwhere we assume that \u03b4(Ee )/Ee is the same at the low\nand high end of the energy spectrum.\nThe complete set of equations for determining the\nmasses from the energy spectrum end-points is:\n\u221a 2\n\u221a\n2\u03b3\u1ebdR M\u1ebdR s = s + (M\u1ebd2R \u2212 M\u1ebd2L )\n\u221a\n\u221a 2\n2\u03b3\u1ebdL M\u1ebdL s = s + (M\u1ebd2L \u2212 M\u1ebd2R )\n\u2217\n2Ee,R\nM\u1ebdR = M\u1ebd2R \u2212 M\u03c7\u030320\n1\n\n\u2217\n2Ee,L\nM\u1ebdL = M\u1ebd2L \u2212 M\u03c7\u030320\n\n(7)\n\n1\n\nThe system, although quadratic, allows one to substitute\nthe quadratic terms and reach a linear solution:\n\u221a\n\u2217\n\u03b3\u1ebdL s + 2Ee,L\n1\u221a\n\u221a\ns\nMR =\n\u2217\n\u2217\n2\n\u03b3\u1ebdL \u03b3\u1ebdR s + \u03b3\u1ebdR Ee,L + \u03b3\u1ebdL Ee,R\n\u221a\n\u2217\n\u03b3\u1ebdR s + 2Ee,R\n1\u221a\n\u221a\ns\nML =\n(8)\n\u2217 + \u03b3 E\u2217\n2\n\u03b3\u1ebdL \u03b3\u1ebdR s + \u03b3\u1ebdL Ee,R\n\u1ebdR e,L\n\nModel of e\u223cL\u00b1\n\nThe fit process that searches for the masses M\u1ebdL , M\u1ebdR\nand M\u03c7\u030301 is carried out with MINUIT [7] that obtains the\nbest solution to the set of equations above.\nThe properties of the above defined distribution are\nquite simple and robust.

Using the difference of the difference, between Right80% and Lef t80% e\u2212 beam polarisations,\nthe differences are enhanced and any detector asymmetries\nbetween charged tracks are effectively cancelled.\n\n\u2206(E )= Lumi * (\u03c3RL \u2212 \u03c3LR ) * (f + f \u2032 ) *\n\u0014\n\u0015\nf\nf\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nRbox\n(E) \u2212\nL\n(E)\n\u2212\nX\n(E)\n(9)\nf + f \u2032 box\nf + f \u2032 box\n\nThis means that the edges can be comfortably resolved,\nas none of them overlap in any energy range. Secondly,\n2\n\n\fwhere X \u2032 (E) is the energy distribution of the visible\n\u2032\ne\u00b1 from the secondary \u03c7\u0303\u00b1\n1 decay, and f and f are\n\u2032\n\u2032\nthe branching fractions to L (E) and X (E) respectively.\nThe power of the method in its initial form is that this\nhistogram has to be normalised to zero, and hence any\npedestal can be determined and subtracted. It also has 2\nnormalisation conditions related to the R\u2032 (E) and L\u2032 (E)\nboxes, that connect the edge positions with the boxheights. To first order there are only 3 free parameters in\nthe fit: M\u1ebdL , M\u1ebdR and M\u03c7\u030301 . This provides a very robust\nfit. In the present case, the X \u2032 (E) distribution (figure 2)\nhas to be parametrised, and this adds an extra parameter\nto the fit. The chosen model was an exponential shape\nfor X \u2032 (E), hence only one extra shape parameter. The\ngeneral idea of the simple fit remains: a robust fit (figure\n3) with few, tightly bound parameters. The fit yields also\nthe f /(f + f \u2032 ) and f \u2032 /(f + f \u2032 ) relative leptonic branch0\n\u2032\ning fractions for the \u03c7\u0303\u00b1\n1 \u03bde and \u03c7\u03031 e. The X (E) shape\nparameter gives general information about the \u03c7\u0303\u00b1\n1 and\n\u03c4\u03031\u00b1 masses.\n\n[GeV]\n\nThis analysis is carried out for the MSSM parameters m0 =100 GeV, m1/2 =250 GeV, A0 =0, tan(\u03b2)=10,\n\u03bc=positive. The resultant masses (in GeV) of the supersymmetric particles in our study is m\u1ebdR =143 , m\u1ebdL =202,\nm\u03c7\u030301 =96, m\u03c7\u0303\u00b1 =174, and m\u03c4\u0303 \u00b1 =135. The errors in the\n1\n1\nmass determination versus luminosity are shown in figure 4 for the \"idealistic\" case with no \u03c7\u0303\u00b1\n1 \u03bde channel, as\nwell as for the \"realistic\" case including the \u03c7\u0303\u00b1\n1 \u03bde . An indication of saturation of the mass-errors with luminosity\nis shown by the fit. The luminosity at which the error\nreaches 80% of its limiting value gives a range of 500 1000 f b\u22121 as the saturation limit. It can be seen that the\nlargest difference in mass-errors between the \"ideal\" and\n\"real\" case is for M\u1ebdR due to its corresponding energy\"box\" neighboring the perturbing X \u2032 (E) distribution.\n\nSaturation errors vs. luminosity\n1\n\n0.4\n0.35\n\n\u223ce \u00b1 mass\nL\n\nISAJET input\n10000\n\n0.25\n\nguess\n8000\n\n6000\n\n6000\n\n0.1\n\n4000\n\n4000\n\n0.05\n\n2000\n\n2000\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-2000\n\n-2000\n\n-4000\n\n-4000\n\n-6000\n\n-6000\n\n-8000\n\n-8000\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150 [GeV]\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\nentries/4 GeV\n\nedges: 3 bin derivative\n\n10000\n\nIDEAL\n1000\n\n2000\n\n0\n\n0.45\n\n1.6\n\n0.4\n\n1.4\n\n\u223ce \u00b1 mass\nL\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\n30\n\n\u223ce \u00b1 mass\nR\n\n1.2\n1\n\n0.1\n\n4000\n\n0.05\n20\n\n0\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\n1000\n\n2000 fb\n\n-1\n\n\u223c\u03c7 0mass\n1\n\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\nIDEAL\n\n0.7\n\n0.6\n\n0.2\n\nREAL\n\n0\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.15\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n40\n\n2000\n\n0.2\n\nIDEAL\n\n0.25\n\n8000\n6000\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\nfit\n\n\u223c\u03c7 0mass\n1\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n0.4\n\n0.35\n\n[GeV]\n\n0.7\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.15\n\n8000\n\n0\n\n\u223ce \u00b1 mass\nR\n\n0.8\n\n0.2\n\n10000\n\n[GeV]\n\nentries/4 GeV\n\n0.3\n\n0.8\n\n0.1\n\nREAL\n1000\n\n2000\n\n0\n\nREAL\n1000\n\n2000 fb\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n-2000\n-4000\n\n0\n\nFIG. 4.
