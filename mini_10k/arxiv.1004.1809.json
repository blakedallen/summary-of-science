WASP-14 is thus the closest\npresently known planet with a confirmed eccentric orbit.\nKey words: planetary systems\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nTransiting planets are an important source of information on\nthe formation, structure and evolution of extra-solar planets.\nWe are monitoring known transiting planetary systems in radial velocity with the SOPHIE spectrograph in the Northern\nhemisphere and HARPS spectrograph in the Southern hemisphere to refine our knowledge of the dynamics of these systems, notably the orbital eccentricity, spin-orbit angle and\n\n?\n\nBased on observations made at the 1.93-m telescopes at Observatoire de Haute-Provence (CNRS), France with the SOPHIE\nspectrograph.\n\npresence of additional companions (e.g. Loeillet et al. 2008;\nH\u00e9brard et al. 2008, ESO Prog. 0812.C-0312).\nIn this paper, we analyse our new SOPHIE radialvelocity data for two transiting planetary systems, WASP12 and WASP-14. Both are characterized by close-in but\napparently eccentric orbits, and therefore represent potentially important systems to constrain the migration, tidal\nand thermal evolution of gas giant planets. We combine our\nradial-velocity data with previously published data and a\nrealistic treatment of correlated noise to calculate updated\nconstraints on the orbital eccentricities.\nThe companion of the 11.7th-magnitude star WASP12 is a particularly interesting example (Hebb et al. 2009,\nhereafter H09). It orbits extremely close to its host star,\n\n\f2\n\nN. Husnoo et al.\n\neven by the standards of the so-called \"hot Jupiters\", with\na period of 1.09 days, corresponding to an orbital distance\nonly 3 times the radius of its host star. Moreover, WASP-12b\nhas an inflated radius, R ' 1.8 RJ , one of the most extreme\nexamples of anomalous radii for hot Jupiters. As a result,\nthe planet fills about half of its Roche lobe (Li et al. 2010).\nWith such a short orbital distance and large size, a gas\ngiant planet is expected to undergo complete orbital synchronisation and circularisation on a short timescale, much\nshorter than the age of a typical field main-sequence cool\nstar. Indeed, most planets orbiting closer than 0.05 AU are\nobserved to have circular orbits. However, H09 determined\na value of e = 0.049 \u00b1 0.015 for the orbital eccentricity\nof WASP-12, a significant departure from circularity. This\nwould make the planet by far the subject of the strongest\ntidal dissipation in any known planetary system. The measured eccentricity is based on fitting a Keplerian orbital motion on the radial velocity measurements collected by H09\nwith the SOPHIE spectrometer (Perruchot et al. 2008) together with transit photometry.\nLi et al. (2010) studied the case of WASP-12 with that\nvalue of eccentricity, and found a large implied mass loss\nand dissipation of tidal energy in the planet.\nIn a transiting system, the time lag between the transit and the occultation has a strong dependence on the\nprojected orbital eccentricity (e cos \u03c9). Therefore, if the occultation can be detected with sufficient significance, this\nprovides a stringent test of the eccentricity. Lopez-Morales\net al. (2009, hereafter L09) have measured the occultation\nof WASP-12b from the ground with SPICam on the ARC\ntelescope at Apache Point Observatory in the z 0 band. Their\nbest-fit result indicated a occultation with a significant time\nlag compared to the epoch expected for a circular orbit, with\na similar level of significance to H09. Nevertheless, the presence of residual correlated noise is apparent in the L09 data\n(see Fig. 2), as expected for ground-based photometry at\nsuch a high accuracy - the depth of the occultation is only\nabout 0.08\u00b10.02 %.\nAs a result, the issue remained inconclusive until a\nspace-based measurement of the occultation with the Spitzer\nSpace Telescope (Campo et al. 2010, hereafter C10) unambiguously showed that the timing of the occultation was\nprecisely that expected for a circular orbit. This result suggested that the L09 time lag was probably due to instrumental systematics, and that the orbit of WASP-12 was probably\ncircular, since a fine-tuned alignment would be required to\nreconcile the Spitzer result with the H09 value of the eccentricity.\nIt is interesting to note that there is an inherent bias\nin eccentricity measurements from radial velocities, because\na Keplerian orbit cannot get more circular than e = 0.\nAny noise applied to a circular orbit will result in an eccentric best-fit orbit. Underestimating the noise will lead\nto spurious detections of small eccentricities. This was already recognized in the context of stellar binaries by Lucy\n& Sweeney (1971). These authors showed that spurious eccentricity detections tended to dominate for e < 0.1 for a\ntypical precision at that time and stellar binary amplitudes.\nFour decades later, both companion masses and RV accuracies having changed by about three orders of magnitudes,\nand the same issue resurfaces for exoplanets.\nWASP-14 is, after WASP-12, the known transiting\n\nplanet having a reported non-circular orbit (Joshi et al.\n2009, e = 0.091 \u00b1 0.003) with the second-shortest period\n(P=2.2 days). This makes it another test-case for tidal evolution of close-in gas giants. If its orbital eccentricity is indeed\nnear 0.1, then this non-zero but relatively low value \u2013 in the\ncontext of the distribution of giant exoplanet eccentricities\n\u2013 makes it likely that this planet has undergone some degree\nof orbital evolution, and is still subject to strong tidal forces\nat present. Therefore its presence may be useful to constrain\nthe tidal synchronisation timescale. It is also an important\nobject when studying the issue of the anomalous radius of\nhot Jupiters because of its inflated size, with Rp = 1.28 RJ .\nWASP-14 occupies a distinctive position in the relevant parameter space: irradiation, orbital distance, eccentricity and\nsize.\n\n2\n\nOBSERVATIONS\n\nWe obtained 29 radial-velocity measurements for WASP-12\n(16 during a single night, and 13 at various values of orbital\nphase) and 11 for WASP-14, using the SOPHIE spectrograph installed on the 1.93-m telescope at OHP (France).\nThe observations were gathered between 17 January 2009\nand 27 March 2010. The 16 in-transit measurements for\nWASP-12 were obtained with the objective of constraining\nthe spin-orbit angle via the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect.\nSOPHIE is a spectrograph optimized for precise radialvelocity measurements and has participated in the detection of numerous transiting exoplanets in the northern\nhemisphere, notably from the WASP and CoRoT transit\nsearches. It reaches a stability of a few m s\u22121 for bright targets. WASP-12 and WASP-14, however, are near the faint\nend of the capacity of the 1.93-m telescope, and were measured in the \"High Efficiency\" mode of SOPHIE (See Perruchot et al. 2008; Bouchy et al. 2009). This mode has a higher\nthroughput than the standard mode, the \"High Resolution\"\nmode, thus allowing fainter targets to be measured, but is\nless optimized for radial velocity. When considering the ensemble of data for known transiting planets obtained with\nSOPHIE, we have found evidence for large excursions of the\nvelocity zero-point with time (to the level of several dozen\nm s\u22121 in some cases). As part of the constant improvement\nof the SOPHIE reduction pipeline, this effect is monitored\nand corrected for as far as possible, but the presence of relatively large instrumental systematics in the High Efficiency\ndata is a possibility, especially with older data collected before we became aware of the issue. This must be remembered\nwhen performing an orbital analysis based on data from the\nHigh Efficiency mode.\n\n3\n\nANALYSIS AND RESULTS\n\nThe orbital parameters of the two transiting planets were\ncalculated from the radial velocity data, (together with\npublished photometry data for the transit and occultation in the case of WASP-12), with a Marko Chain Monte\nCarlo (MCMC) method. The main advantage of the MCMC\nmethod is that it allows a seamless combination of radialvelocity data with light-curve data both for the transit and\noccultation, as well as information on the parent star. The\n\n\fWASP-12\nuse of MCMC in this context is described by, among others, Holman et al. (2006). Our implementation is described\nin Pont et al. (2009). We use a Bayesian treatment of the\na priori constraints from stellar evolution models with the\nmethod of Pont & Eyer (2004). We model the radial velocity using a Keplerian orbit, the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect\non the radial velocity using Gim\u00e9nez (2006) and the transit\nand eclipse light curves using Mandel & Agol (2002).\nMCMC methods are powerful, but they also tend to\nobscure the relation between the errors on the measured\ndata and the calculated uncertainties on the final system\nparameters. Neglecting non-random sources of noise in the\ndata (such as instrumental systematics and stellar variability) can lead to an underestimation of the uncertainties in\nthe final system parameters by a large factor (Pont et al.\n2006),and, in the case of orbital eccentricities, to a systematic bias (Lucy & Sweeney 1971). We account for the presence of correlated noise in both the photometric and radial velocity data by modifying the merit function used in\nthe MCMC to include the possible presence of non-random\nnoise.\n\n3.1\n\nThe orbital eccentricity of WASP-12\n\nFigure 1 displays our radial-velocity data for WASP-12, together with a circular orbital solution (solid line, residuals\nshown in the lower panel) and the eccentric-orbit fit of H09\n(dotted). Our radial velocity data is shown together with\nthe H09 data in the right panel. As the Figure shows clearly,\nthe radial-velocity signal cannot be adequately modelled by\na periodic orbital signal affected by random noise. The presence of a correlated non-periodic component is especially\nobvious during the in-transit sequence. This could be due\nto instrumental noise, stellar variability or an unaccounted\nplanetary companion in the system, all of which would behave in the same way as far as the orbital fit is concerned.\nGiven our experience with SOPHIE in High Efficiency mode,\nwe consider the first cause as likely.\nWe use the transit lightcurve from H09 and the eclipse\nlightcurve from L09 with our own radial velocity measurements to fit a Keplerian orbit, and we account for the effect\nof red noise by modifying the uncertainties on the data using \u03c3 0 = (\u03c3 2 + N \u03c3r2 )1/2 , where \u03c3 is the random error, \u03c3 0\nthe modified error used to compute the merit function for\nthe MCMC, \u03c3r the red-noise factor, and N the number of\ndata points over a typical correlation timespan. The reader\nis referred to Pont et al. (2006) and Winn (2010 in prep)\nfor more details on this approach. For the H09 photometric\ntransit, we estimate \u03c3r = 0.0005 and N = 20. Similarly, for\nthe L09 data, we set \u03c3r = 0.0002 and N = 9. For our own\nradial velocity data, we estimate the red noise parameter to\nbe 8 m s\u22121 , and N = 16 during the transit and N = 1 outside the transit (these points are taken in different nights so\nthat the errors are not expected to be correlated).\nWe vary the period P , mid-transit time Ttr , system velocity v0 , eccentricity components e cos \u03c9 and e sin \u03c9, semiamplitude K, impact parameter b, scaled radius Rp /Rs , the\nmass Ms , radius Rs and Teff of the star. The scaled semimajor axis a/Rs is calculated from the assumption of a Keplerian orbit using the period P .\nWe set the quadratic limb darkening parameters for the\n\n3\n\nH09 transit to ua = 0.1274 and ub = 0.3735 according to\nClaret (2004).\nOur results for the orbital parameters of the WASP-12\nsystem are shown in Table 1. Table 1 shows the results of\nour new SOPHIE RV data used in combination with the H09\ntransit lightcurve, and the L09 and C10 eclipse lightcurves,\ncompared to the H09 parameters.\nAlthough our data covers a complete spectroscopic\ntransit, and thus potentially constrains the projected spinorbit angle of the WASP-12 system through the RossiterMcLaughlin effect, the constraint is weak once the possible\npresence of non-random noise is taken into account. The distribution of the spin-orbit angle from our MCMC spans a\nwide interval extending from a prograde orbit to a projected\nspin-orbit angle larger than 90 degrees. The data marginally\nfavours a prograde rather than retrograde orbit.\nThe best solution with our radial velocity data and the\nconstrains from the transit and eclipse light curves gives\ne = 0.017+0.015\n\u22120.010 . This is a marginal detection, so we set\ne = 0 to work out the rest of the system parameters.The H09\nradial-velocity data forces the solution towards a higher eccentricity, significant at the \u223c3\u03c3 level, but Figure 1 strongly\nsuggests that this is probably an artefact due to an excursion\nof the zero-point between different nights.\nIt is interesting to compare the situation in radial velocity with the similar sequence of events regarding the occultation photometric data. Figure 2 (left panel) shows the\neclipse data for both L09 (top two panels) and C10 (bottom\ntwo panels). The solid line represents the L09 solution, and\nthe residuals are plotted for both datasets. The L09 solution is somewhat plausible for the L09 data but definitely\nnot for the C10 data. The dotted line shows the a circular\norbit e = 0. Figure 2 (right panel) shows the same data, but\nthe solid line is now a circular orbit e = 0, and the residuals\nfor both datasets are again plotted. It is clear that the circular solution fits the C10 dataset and remains reasonable\nfor the L09 dataset. This could be explained if the effects of\ninstrumental systematics had been underestimated in L09.\n3.2\n\nThe orbital eccentricity of WASP-14\n\nFigure 3 shows our SOPHIE data and the FIES and SOPHIE\ndata from Joshi et al. (2009) along with with the best-fit orbit and a circular orbit. We adopt the prior distribution on\nthe period P from photometric data by Johnson et al. (2009)\nand that on the mid-transit time Ttr from Joshi et al. (2009).\nWe include their value of Rp /Rs , a/Rs and v sin i to compute\nthe Rositter-McLaughlin effect, and estimate the quadratic\nlimb darkening coefficients ua = 0.405 and ub = 0.337 from\nClaret (2004). We work out the orbital parameters using\nboth our radial velocity data and that published in the discovery paper (since we do not have any radial velocity data\nduring the transit, the RM effect from that paper are not\nsignificantly modified). We include the effect of red noise in\na similar manner explained above, adding 8 m s\u22121\u221aof correlated uncertainties to each single datapoint and N \u00d7 8\nm s\u22121 to each point in each group of N points taken on the\nsame night.\nOur results are shown in Table 2. Our best-fit value\nfor the orbital eccentricity is e = 0.088 \u00b1 0.003, in good\nagreement with the value found by Joshi et al. (2009).\nWe examined the possibility of a scenario similar to\n\n\fN.

System parameters for WASP-12. Left: H09. Right: Our SOPHIE radial velocity data, H09 transit photometry data and L09\nand C10 eclipse photometry data.\n\u2217 We adopt a circular orbit for working out the rest of the system parameters.\n\nthat of WASP-12, with correlated noise causing a spurious\neccentricity detection. The lower panel of Figure 3 shows\nthe residuals around the best-fit circular orbit (given by a\nMCMC run with e = 0 fixed). We find that, in contrast to\nthe case of WASP-12, the differences between observation\nand model assuming a circular solution are periodic and regular, which would not be the case for correlated noise. We\nalso looked for possible evidence for a second planetary companion in the system by examining the residuals as function\nof time, finding no unambiguous trend.\n\nC10 suggested that, for an eccentric orbit, the difference\nbetween the eclipse phase in C10 and L09 could be due to\napsidal precession. This would require that the argument\nof periastron had changed from \u03c9 = \u221274+13\n\u221210 in Feb 2008\n(H09) to \u03c9 \u223c \u221290o in Oct 2008 (C10). In terms of the\nprojected component of the eccentricity, e cos \u03c9, one obtains\ne cos \u03c9 = 0.014 \u00b1 0.004 in Feb 2008 using the H09 orbital\nparameters, C10 found e cos \u03c9 = 0.0019\u00b10.0007 in Oct 2008,\nL09 found e cos \u03c9 = 0.0156\u00b10.0035 in Feb-Oct 2009, and our\nresult is e cos \u03c9 = 0.0037\u00b10.0035 for January 2009 to March\n2010. When considered in the order that observations were\nmade, these values do not support the hypothesis of apsidal\nprecession.\n\n4\n\nA circular orbit for WASP-12 removes the needs for\nmodels to explain the survival of such an eccentricity at\nthis very short period, in face of what would have been extremely strong tidal effects. In particular, the scenario of Li\net al. (2010), using the eccentricity from H09 to infer values of mass loss and tidal dissipation for WASP-12, lose its\nprincipal empirical support.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nOur results confirm the strong indications of C10 that all\nthe available data for WASP-12 is compatible with a circular\norbit, and that the eccentricity of the best-fit orbit to the\nradial velocity of H09 and subsequently the occultation data\nof L09 may be due to correlated noise. Not accounting for\nthis noise in the statistical analysis could lead to an apparent\n\u223c 3\u03c3 significance for the rejection of the null hypothesis\n(e = 0), but the new data strongly suggest that the orbit of\nWASP-12b is indeed circular.\n\nThe eccentricity of WASP-14b, by contrast, is solidly\nconfirmed by our measurements. This illustrates the capacity of SOPHIE to measure accurate values of orbital eccen-\n\n\fResiduals\n\n0.0005\n0.0000\n0.0005\n\n0.0005\n0.0000\n0.0005\n\nFlux\n\n0.003\n0.002\n0.001\n0.000\n0.001\n0.002\n0.003\n0.40\n\n0.45\n\n0.50\nPhase\n\n0.55\n\n0.60\n\n5\n\n1.0010\n1.0005\n1.0000\n0.9995\n0.9990\n0.9985\n\nPhase\n\n1.001\n1.000\n0.999\n0.998\n0.997\n0.996\n0.995\n\nResiduals\n\nResiduals\n\nFlux\n\n1.0010\n1.0005\n1.0000\n0.9995\n0.9990\n0.9985\n\nFlux\n\nResiduals\n\nFlux\n\nWASP-12\n\nPhase\n\n1.001\n1.000\n0.999\n0.998\n0.997\n0.996\n0.995\n0.003\n0.002\n0.001\n0.000\n0.001\n0.002\n0.003\n0.40\n\n0.45\n\n0.50\nPhase\n\n0.55\n\n0.60\n\nFigure 2.

There is a well-know trend for the inner planets to have circular orbits, due to tidal orbital decay. If the\nWASP-12 system follows a circular orbit, the WASP-14 system establishes a new lower limit for the point at which\norbital eccentricity can survive tidal evolution for a sufficiently long time to be observed in a sample not selected\nby age. The fact that the eccentricity of WASP-14 is clearly\nnon-zero, but also near the lower end of the eccentricity distribution for planets out of reach of tidal evolution (broadly\ndistributed between 0 and 1) probably indicates that this object has already undergone some tidal evolution. As a result,\nWASP-14 is an interesting object to constrain the tidal evolution, intensity of tidal torque and relation between tides\nand size, for gas giant planets.\nWASP-10 is a third known transiting planets closer than\n\n0.04 AU with a possible non-circular orbit. However, the eccentricity found by Christian et al. (2009) is significant to a\nlevel similar to H09 for WASP-12, and based in a comparable\nnumber and quality of RV measurements. The evidence for a\ncircular orbit actually rests on two SOPHIE measurements,\nwith residuals compared to a circular orbit that are comparable to the amplitude of the instrumental effects found in\nthe High Efficiency mode. It is therefore possible that this\ndetection too is due to underestimated instrumental systematics acting on a circular orbit, in the manner described in\nLucy & Sweeney (1971).\nThe fact that WASP-12b has a large size (Rp = 1.79 RJ ,\nfor a = 0.0229 and e \u223c 0) and WASP-14b a smaller but still\nmarkedly inflated size (Rp = 1.28 RJ , for a = 0.037 AU and\ne \u223c 0.09), provides a challenging test for theories attempting\nto account for the anomalous radii of some hot jupiters.\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank the SOPHIE Exoplanet Consortium for arranging\na flexible observation schedule for our programme, and the\nwhole OHP/SOPHIE team for support.\n\n\f6\n\nN.
