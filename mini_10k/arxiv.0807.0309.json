In\npractice, default risk computations are directly involved in three, closely connected, but still separated areas: first, the pricing of single and multiname\ncredit derivatives (ABS, CDS, CDOs...), second, risk valuation for regulatory,\nrisk management and economic capital valuation purposes, third, rating assignements. The present article is focused mainly on the first two aspects of\nrisk valuation. Notice however that the next generation of rating methodologies\nwill most probably have to include advanced correlation tools such as the ones\nconsidered here.\nAlthough deriving new formulas for credit derivative transactions on two\nassets, our main interest will be on counterparty risk. Once again, this is a\n\u2217 Consultant,\n\nZeliade Systems.\n\n1\n\n\fcentral argument, both for regulatory purposes (counterparty risk was already\na key issue in the Basel 1 agreements, but its relevance and complexity was\nemphasized by the later improvements of the set of rules, see e.g. [1, 9, 2]) and\nalso for practical risk management.\nConcretely, the 2007 \"subprime\" credit crisis has emphasized how a mispricing of counterparty risk could be dangerous. Before the crisis, financial\ninstitutions engaged heavily in credit derivatives transactions for hedging purposes. One of the main side effects of the crisis has been to reveal that their\ncounterparties were not reliable: monoline insurers (who act traditionaly as\nguarantees for municipalities-type bond emissions but engaged more recently in\nthe ABS business) faced downgrades and/or bankruptcy, whereas some companies offering CDS protection have also been on the wedge of bankruptcy due\nto spread widenings and collateral agreements. In spite of these facts, in the\npresent state of the art quantitative counterparty risk assessment is still largely\nin infancy.\nWe address here one of the fundamental questions in the field, namely we\nintroduce a Merton-type model and derive formulas for the joint distributions\nof the default events -and other relevant joint probabilities- of two default-prone\nentities. Closed formulas for counterparty risk on a CDS transaction or for a\nfirst-to-default swap on two underlyings follow.\nNotice that we refrain to seek for the outmost generality or for a complete list\nof pricing formulas that could be obtained using the methods developed in the\npresent article. Most credit derivatives on two underlyings with time-dependent\npayoffs can actually be priced using our results. The exercise of deriving the\ncorresponding formulas is left to the interested reader.\n\n2\n\nModeling two dimensional default risk.\n\nRecall that we are interested in modeling the counterparty risk on a credit risk\ntransaction. This involves (in general and depending of the particular features of\nthe transaction) the computation of various joint laws. For example, for a vanilla\ncredit default swap, the computation relies on the distribution of the default\ntime of the counterparty and the conditional distribution (w.r. to the default\nof the counterparty) of the values of the CDS contract. The same methodology\ncan be applied to the valuation of first-to-default contracts on two underlyings\nwhen the payoff is time-dependent (see section 4 of the present article; the\ntime-independent case has been addressed in [8, 17, 13]).\nWe follow Merton's structural approach to risk, where the default of a company is triggered by its firm value falling below a threshold (see [12] or e.g. [4,\nChap. 3]). It is well-known that the original Merton methodology, where the\nthreshold is determined by the firm's liabilities, as well as its natural refinements\nsuch as the Black-Cox first passage time formulas [3], give qualitatively good\nbut numerically poor results. For example, the structural method will rank correctly the risks of two companies but will not be able to predict the spreads of\nthe corresponding CDS. For pricing purposes, the correct way to use the Merton\nand Black-Cox models is to calibrate their parameters on the market prices of\nthe securities issued by the companies. Doing so insures that the models price\ncorrectly the risk. This is the ground for their various uses, either in credit risk\nmeasurement (think to the Basel 2 Vasicek-type large pool formulas [15, 9]),\n\n2\n\n\feither for pricing purposes (think to the one-factor Gaussian copula model for\nCDO tranches [14]).\nNotice that the computations we are interested in require to go beyond\nthe existing formulas for two-dimensional credit risk in the structural approach\n[8, 17, 13]. Indeed, the formulas in these articles rely mainly on the computation\nof the probability that one (and only one) out of two firms defaults or that the\ntwo firms default before a given maturity, whereas pricing counterparty risk for\na CDS transaction requires (among others) the exact knowledge of default times\ndistributions.\nWe have tried to keep some balance between generality and the choice of too\nrestrictive assumptions. Notice that the model may be simplified by selecting a\nsuitable subset of meaningful parameters, depending on the particular situations\nand/or the available set of data. In the end, the model we use is as follows.\nWe label 1 and 2 the two default-prone entities. In view of applications to\ncounterparty risk, the counterparty will be labelled 2. We write \u03c41 (resp. \u03c42 ) for\nthe random time when the first (resp. second) entity defaults. Since we work\nin the structural model, defaults are triggered when two log-normal processes\nV1 and V2 associated respectively to the first and second entity fall below a\nbarrier process. As in Black-Cox [3], we assume that the barrier is described by\na time-dependent deterministic process vi (t) := Ki e\u03b3i t . At last, we assume that\nthe risk-neutral dynamics of the processes V1 and V2 are given by:\ndVi (t)\n= (r \u2212 ki )dt + \u03c3i dBi (t),\nVi (t)\nwhere r is the constant short-term interest rate and Bi , i = 1, 2 are two Brownian motions. The coefficient ki is a payout ratio representing net payouts/inflows\nby the firm, see e.g. the account of Merton's approach in [4, Chap.2]. Notice\nthat we use a risk-neutral dynamics since we are interested in pricing formulas,\nbut the same construction holds with a real-life dynamics (just replace r \u2212 ki\nby the drift under the historical probability).\nAt last, we assume that the Brownian motions B1 and B2 are correlated:\nCov(B1 (t), B2 (t)) = \u033at. This is an important assumption that reflects the fact\nthat the counterparty of a CDS transaction is usually a well-rated company\nthat will not default excepted in a very bad macroeconomic environment. In\nparticular, if the counterparty defaults, one may expect CDS spread on other\nentities to widen considerably simultaneously. This phenomenon is accounted\nfor by a positive correlation coefficient. It is the main reason, together with\nthe dynamical aspects of the problem, why simplistic counterparty risk models\nfail, both theoretically and empirically, to account for counterparty-driven loss\nexpectations on derivative contracts.\n\n3\n\nCounterparty risk\n\nIn this section, we derive a closed formula for the counterparty default leg of a\nCDS contract, that is the present value (PV) of the expected losses on a vanilla\nsingle-name credit derivative transaction due to the default of the protection\nseller. Notice that the notion of counterparty default leg should not be confused\nwith the usual notion of default leg for a CDS contract, that is, the present value\nof future payments by the protection seller.\n3\n\n\fWe follow standard market practices. Namely, we assume that the CDS\ncontract has a notional value C and that, if the underlying entity defaults, the\nbuyer of protection receives (1 \u2212 Ru ) * C from the seller of protection, where Ru\nstands for the recovery rate of the underlying entity. Similarly, if the counterparty (the protection seller) defaults at t on the CDS contract, we assume that\nthe buyer of protection receives (1 \u2212 Rc ) * Vt+ , where Vt+ = sup(0, Vt ) stands for\nthe positive part of the market value of the CDS contract at t, and where Rc\nstands for the counterparty recovery rate. The present moment is normalized\nto t = 0 in what follows, it may or may not coincide with the inception of the\nCDS contract.\n\n3.1\n\nCounterparty default leg\n\nUsing the joint law of the default time of the counterparty and of the underlying\nentity for the CDS, we compute the default probability of the underlying entity\nconditional to the default of the counterparty, and obtain a closed formula for\nthe counterparty default leg.\nThe coupon payments rate (CDS spread) by the protection buyer is written s.\nWe assume continuous payments of the fees: in practice, fees are payed quarterly\n(and sometimes semi-annually), but due to the payments-in-arrears conventions,\nthe continuous payments assumption is a reasonable one. It is usually defined,\nat inception of the contract, by equalizing the fee and default legs of the CDS\ncontract (see Section 3.3. Some empirical adjustment is sometimes done for\nthe counterparty default risk, taking into account advanced risk management\nparameters such as netting agreements. Our computation of the counterparty\ndefault leg leads to a new, sounder, methodology, to assess the fair value of this\nadjustment.\nFirst, the theoretical counterparty default leg Dc is given by\nDc\n\n=\n\n(1 \u2212 Rc ) * E[e\u2212r\u03c42 * sup(0, p(V1 (\u03c42 ), \u03c42 ))1\u03c42 <(T \u2227\u03c41 ) ]\n\nwhere p(V1 (\u03c42 ), \u03c42 ) is the market price of the CDS contract at t = \u03c42 (when\n\u03c41 \u2265 \u03c42 ). The value p(V1 (\u03c42 ), \u03c42 ) is obtained as the difference between the\ndefault and fee legs, that is:\np(V1 (\u03c42 ), \u03c42 ) = Dl (V1 (\u03c42 ), \u03c42 ) \u2212\n\nsC\n* E[(1 \u2212 e\u2212r((T \u2227\u03c41 )\u2212\u03c42 ) )1\u03c41 \u2265\u03c42 |F\u03c42 ]\nr\n\nwhere we write Ft , as usual, for the natural filtration of the probability space\nunderlying the two Brownian motions B1 (t), B2 (t).\nNotice that the term T \u2227 \u03c41 can be, in most situations, safely replaced by T\nin the previous expansion. This is because, for standard values for the spreads\nand implied default probabilities in single-name default risk computations, the\ncomputation of the fee leg conditional to the hypothesis that no default occurs\nis a good first-order approximation to the unconditional fee leg.

As usual, it is obtained as difference between the default and fee\nlegs, but, contrary to the usual pricing formulas, we take into account exactly\nthe effect of the counterparty default leg.\nNotice that we insist in deriving exact formulas but, for practical purposes,\nit may be convenient to use the standard approximation schemes to simplify\nthe use of the formulas and fasten the computations. For example, in order to\ncompute the fee leg, it may be convenient to assume that defaults can occur\nonly at times ti , i = 1...n, so that the following integral expressions can be\nsafely replaced by finite sums involving only the computation of the default\nprobabilities P(\u03c41 \u2227 \u03c42 \u2264 t).\nLet us write Ds for the \"standard\" default leg of the CDS, that is, the present\nvalue of the cash-flows corresponding to payments by the seller of protection if\nthere is a default occurring on the assets underlying the CDS contract.

This natural extension is important in view of\napplications to multidimensional Brownian processes, particularly in the setting\nof credit risk. It was first announced without a proof in [11] and could be easily\nextended to higher dimensional cases. We could not find a proof in the literature,\nand include therefore a short demonstration in this appendix.\n(x ,y )\nLet Zt 0 0 (abbreviated to Zt when no confusion can arise), a planar Brownian starting at (x0 , y0 ) evolving in a polyhedral domain D with absorbing boundary \u2202D. We write \u03c4 for the first hitting time of the boundary and f (x0 , y0 , x, y, t)\n(abbreviated to f (x, y, t) when no confusion can arise) for the density of the surviving process:\nf (x, y, t)dxdy := P (Zt \u2208 (dx, dy), \u03c4 > t)\n\nWe look for the distribution of hitting times: P (\u03c4 \u2208 dt, Z\u03c4 \u2208 dp), dp \u2208 \u2202D\nand can assume (up to a planar rotation) that \u2202D is horizontal and an upper\nboundary for D in the neighborhood of p, so that dp is a horizontal line element:\ndp = (da, b), with p = (a, b) \u2208 \u2202D.\nTheorem 6.1 We have:\n\nP (\u03c4 \u2208 dt, Z\u03c4 = (da, b)) =\n10\n\n\u2212\n\n1 \u2202\nf (a, b, t)dadt.\n2 \u2202b\n\n(1)\n\n\fSketch of the proof : Let us write \u03c6(x, y, \u2206t)dadt for P (\u03c4 \u2208 dt, Z\u03c4 \u2208\n(da, b)|Zt\u2212\u2206t = (x, y)), where in practice we will choose \u2206t << 1 and study\nthe asymptotics when \u2206t goes to 0. From Daniels' theorem [6, Fla 3.1] which\ncomputes the first exit density for a one-dimensional BM, together with the\nindependence of the horizontal and vertical components of a two-dimensional\nBM, we get, in a neighborhood of (a, b):\n\u03c6(x, y, \u2206t) \u223c\n=\n\n(a \u2212 x)2\n(b \u2212 y)2\n1\nexp\n\u2212\n*\nexp\n\u2212\n* (b \u2212 y)\n2\u03c0\u2206t2\n2\u2206t\n2\u2206t\n\nThen,\nP (\u03c4 \u2208 dt, Z\u03c4 \u2208 (da, b))da\n\n\u22121\n\ndt\n\n\u22121\n\nZ\n\n=\n\nf (x, y, t \u2212 \u2206t)\u03c6(x, y, \u2206t)dxdy\n\nD\n\n\u223c\n=\n\nZ\n\n[f (a, y, t\u2212\u2206t)+(x\u2212a)fx\u2032 (a, y, t\u2212\u2206t)+\n\n(x \u2212 a)2 \u2032\u2032\nfx (a, y, t\u2212\u2206t)]\u03c6(x, y, \u2206t)dxdy\n2\n\nD\n\nBy symmetry, in a neighborhood of (a, b) in D, \u03c6(x, y, \u2206t) \u223c\n= \u03c6(2a\u2212x, y, \u2206t),\nso that the second term of the expansion vanishes.
