Introduction\nThe evidence of dark matter is compelling at all observed astrophysical\nscales [1, 2]. At that the dark matter reveals itself only through its gravitational interactions. There are no observational facts that indicate existence of any significant interactions between the ordinary and dark matter\nparticles. However, some recent astrophysical observations show that dark\nmatter particles may have significant self-interactions. This is surprising because other observations support the WIMP paradigm that the dark matter\nis essentially collisionless. The mirror dark matter [3, 4, 5], first introduced\nin [6], has a potential to reconcile these seemingly contradictory observational facts. For other attempts to do this, on the base of BEC dark matter,\nsee [7]. Below, after briefly commenting the mirror matter idea, we consider\nthe above mentioned observational facts and argue why, in our opinion,\nthey indicate the existence of the mirror matter as the main dark matter\ncomponent.\n(1)\n\n\f2\n\nmirDM\n\nprinted on November 5, 2018\n\n2. Mirror matter\nOne of characteristic features of our present day increasingly shallow\npostmodern culture is the existence of a \"literature horizon\" beyond which\nmany interesting results of the past have fallen. \"References familiar to\none generation are often less so or unknown to the successive one, an effect\nwhich increases with the passage of time\" [8].\nIt is still widely known that in their famous article [9] Lee and Yang\nrevealed \"The fact that parity conservation in the weak interactions was\nbelieved for so long without experimental support\" [10] and hypothesized\nthe possibility of parity non-conservation in the weak interactions. The\nhypothesis turned out to be true, as the subsequent experiments had shown,\nand nowadays it is a firmly established fact that our universe is left-handed\nas far as the weak interactions are concerned.\nWhat is not so widely known is the fact that at the end of the very\nsame paper Lee and Yang indicated how left-right symmetry of the world\ncould be rescued by duplicating the non-symmetric part of our left-handed\nuniverse in the mirror.\nIt is a futile business to establish priority in the genesis of physical\nideas. Seldom a good physical idea is already mature at the time of its\nfirst appearance and, as a rule, many people participate in its subsequent\ndevelopments.\nIn a very postmodern fashion, we can deprive Lee and Yang priority of\nthe mirror matter idea and attribute it, for example, to Lewis Carroll. To\nparaphrase his Alice Through the Looking Glass, \"the mirror particles are\nsomething like our particles, only the chiralities go the wrong way . . . \" [11].\nJorge Luis Borges, famous Argentine poet, essayist, and short-story\nwriter, with his classic tales of fantasy and dreamworlds, is another candidate to whom the idea of duplication of the world through mirrors could\nbe attributed. Berezinsky and Vilenkin cite [12] somewhat incomplete quote\nfrom Borges: \"The visible universe is an illusion. Mirrors . . . are hateful because they multiply it\". We found that it appears in the short story of\nBorges Tl\u00f6n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius, written in 1940, and in the complete\nform has somewhat different accents, going like this: \"For one of those\ngnostics, the visible universe was an illusion or (more precisely) a sophism.\nMirrors and fatherhood are abominable because they multiply and disseminate that universe\" [13].\nHowever, the most complete and clear explanation of the mirror matter\nidea is provided by 1946 lithograph print \"Magic Mirror\" of famous Dutch\nartist M. C. Escher (see Fig.1). Our world is presented at this lithograph as\na left-handed procession of small griffins (winged lions). Griffins are symbols of ordinary particles which participate in the left-handed (V-A) weak\n\n\fmirDM\n\nprinted on November 5, 2018\n\n3\n\ninteractions. Interactions between ordinary particles are governed by the\nStandard Model gauge group G = SU (3) \u00d7 SU (2) \u00d7 SU (1) (or by its Grand\nUnification or supersymmetric extension). The corresponding gauge bosons\nare indicated at the lithograph, perhaps, by a small solid sphere around\nwhich the griffins' procession goes on. This part of the universe (lithograph)\nis clearly not mirror-symmetric (parity is violated in our world). However,\nwhen reflected in the mirror it gives a birth of the mirror partners of every\nordinary particle including the gauge ones. Mirror griffins participate in a\nright-handed procession around the mirror copy of the the Standard Model\ngauge group G\u2032 = SU \u2032 (3) \u00d7 SU \u2032 (2) \u00d7 SU \u2032 (1). Mirror weak interactions are\nright-handed (V+A) and in overall the mirror symmetry of the universe\n(lithograph) is restored.\n\nFig. 1. Mirror matter idea illustrated by M. C. Escher's lithograph 'Magic Mirror'.\n\nAs we see, the idea of Mirror World was already presented in fiction\nliterature and art when Lee and Yang gave the beginning of the physical\nincarnation of the idea which immediately had fallen beyond the literature\nhorizon. After a decade, Kobzarev, Okun and Pomeranchuk, influenced by\nthe Landau's idea of combined parity and subsequent experimental discovery\nof CP-violation, digged out the mirror matter concept from the literature\nhorizon and gave it the first serious phenomenological consideration [6]. This\npaper marked the real beginning of the mirror matter story. It was argued\nthat almost all elementary particles should be duplicated (with possible\nexclusion of some neutral particles) and that the mirror particles can not\n\n\f4\n\nmirDM\n\nprinted on November 5, 2018\n\nhave common strong and electromagnetic interactions with ordinary particles. The concepts of \"Mirror Matter\" and corresponding invisible \"Mirror\nWorld\"(after Lewis Carroll's Alice Through the Looking Glass), as complex\nas our own world, were introduced in this work for the first time and observational effects of the mirror matter were investigated. Some further\ninvestigations of possible astrophysical effects of the hidden sector particles\nfollowed [14, 15, 16], but the idea was still not far from the literature horizon until it was rediscovered in the modern context of renormalizable gauge\ntheories by Foot, Lew and Volkas [17] and used in the context of neutrino\noscillations [18, 19].\nOkun's recent review [20] cites more than 250 references related to the\nmirror matter idea and we hope that it remains outside the literature horizon. However the idea is still little known to the majority of physicists,\noriented at the mainstream.\n3. Empirical evidence of dark matter from the bullet cluster\nGalaxy clusters are the largest gravitationally constrained structures\nsitting atop of the hierarchical structure formation in the universe [21, 22].\nBecause of their size, their matter content resembles the matter content of\nthe Universe with the dark matter as the major mass component (about\n85%). Two other main ingredients of a typical cluster are stars which are\ngrouped to form member galaxies (about 5% of the total cluster mass) and\nvery hot (virialized) intergalactic gas (about 10%).\nThis three components behave differently when two galaxy clusters collide. Note that merger events are typical for hierarchical structure formation\nand drive the formation of larger systems from the smaller ones. However,\nat the scale of galaxy clusters mergers are rather rare events. Nevertheless\nseveral interesting merger events were observed recently which constitute\nfascinating laboratories to study dark matter behavior under these titanic\ncollisions. Most dark matter theories predict that self-interaction of the\ndark matter particles (WIMPs) are very feeble and, therefore, dark matter\nis collisionless.\nThen it is expected that the dark matter components of the colliding\nclusters do not perturb much each other during the collision allowing them to\npass right through. The stars in the member galaxies also form collisionless\nsystem because stars are sparse and star collisions are rare. Therefore,\nduring the collision it is expected dark matter to follow the galaxies and\nthese two components of the cluster should stay together even after the\ncollision, while the third component (hot intergalactic gas) having strong\nelectromagnetic self-interaction should lag behind near the collision center\nand show signs of hydrodynamic disturbances like shock waves formed as a\n\n\fmirDM\n\nprinted on November 5, 2018\n\n5\n\nresult of supersonic collisions of gas components of colliding clusters.\nThis is precisely what is observed in the Bullet Cluster, more formally\nknown as 1E0657-56. Fig.2 is a composite image of this cluster. The Hubble\nSpace Telescope and Magellan optical image shows cluster's member galaxies in orange and white. The distribution of hot intergalactic gas is traced\nby Chandra X-ray observations and is superimposed on the image in pink.\nThe dark matter component of the cluster can not be seen neither in optical\nnor in X-rays, but it can be revealed by gravitational lensing which leads\nto the distortion of images of background galaxies. The distribution of the\ndark matter (unseen concentration of mass) found by gravitational lensing\nstudies is indicated in blue in Fig.2.\n\nFig. 2. Dark matter in the Bullet cluster.\n\nWe see that the galaxies and the corresponding dark matter clumps stay\ntogether and the pink clumps lag behind. Besides, a classic bow-shaped\nshock wave is clearly seen on the right in the pink image of the smaller\ncluster hot gas component giving it a bullet-like appearance.\nWe can conclude, therefore, that the Bullet cluster constitutes the first\ndirect empirical evidence in favor of dark matter [23]. At first sight, all these\nare good news for WIMP based dark matter models. Especially if we take\n\n\f6\n\nmirDM\n\nprinted on November 5, 2018\n\ninto account that the similar behavior was also observed in other merging\ngalaxy clusters CL 0152-1357 [24] and MS 1054-0321 [25]. In latter case the\ndark matter clumps seem to be offset not only from the corresponding X-ray\npeaks but also from the galaxy counterparts, as if they were moving ahead\nof the cluster galaxies. Therefore, in this particular case, the dark matter\nbehaves as effectively more collisionless than the cluster galaxies. Another\ninteresting peculiarity of MS 1054-0321 is that there is no associated X-ray\npeak in the eastern region where the weak-lensing and luminosity map reveal\nsignificant mass concentrations [25]. This maybe indicates that most of the\nintracluster gas of the eastern clump has been stripped by RAM pressure\nwhile passing through the denser regions of the colliding cluster [25].\n4. Dark matter in the Abell 520 cluster\nMatters are not so simple, however. Observations of another merging\ngalaxy cluster Abell 520 (see Fig.3) seem to be puzzling for WIMP dark\nmatter theories [26].\n\nFig. 3. Dark matter in the Abell 520 cluster.\n\nAs expected, X-ray emission is offset from the galaxy distribution. However, in contrast to the Bullet cluster, the lensing signal and the X-ray emission coincide and lag behind the galaxies indicating that the dark matter is\n\n\fmirDM\n\nprinted on November 5, 2018\n\n7\n\ncollisional like the ordinary gases. The inferred estimate on the dark matter self-interaction cross section is well above the upper limit derived for\nthe Bullet cluster and exceeds by many orders the cross section magnitude\nexpected for WIMPs [26].\nCertainly, mirror dark matter \"is richer than the dark matter of SUSY\"\n[20] and has a better chance to be reconciled with these contradictory astrophysical observations.\nIt is important to realize that at macroscopic level mirror and ordinary\nmatters are expected to behave differently [27, 28] because the nucleosynthesis bounds demand the mirror sector to have a smaller temperature than\nthe ordinary one and hence a different cosmological evolution.\nIn particular, mirror stars should be helium dominated and evolve faster\nthan the ordinary ones [29]. Consequently, mirror supernova rate is expected\nto be larger and star formation more efficient in the mirror sector due to\nshock waves related to the supernova explosions. As a result, we expect\nmirror galaxies to contain less gas compared to the ordinary galaxies [29].\nNevertheless some fraction of mirror gas will be inevitably present.\nIn case of the mirror dark matter, therefore, we expect diverse behavior\nduring galaxy cluster collisions, as diverse as for the ordinary matter. At\nthat a typical cluster of mirror galaxies is expected to be less gas dominated\nthan its ordinary counterpart leading, therefore, to the Bullet cluster like\nbehavior. However, other atypical possibilities like Abell 520 is also not\nexcluded.\n5. Further evidence that dark matter behaves like ordinary\nmatter\nCould we find other indications that dark matter behaves like ordinary\nmatter forming a diversity of structures? One possible candidate is a remarkable discovery of a ringlike dark matter structure in the galaxy cluster\nCl 0024+17 [30]. This galaxy cluster is like the Bullet cluster but viewed\nalong the collision axis at a much later epoch [30]. Fig.4 is a composite\nimage of Cl 0024+17 with reconstructed distribution of the dark matter\nindicated in blue. A huge dark matter ring of 2.6 million light-years across\nis clearly seen.\nFor ordinary matter, ringlike structures are common output of violent\ncollision events both at the scale of galaxies and at the scale of galaxy\nclusters. For example, Very Large Array radio telescope discovered recently\na giant ring-shaped radio-emitting structures of about 6 million light-years\nacross around the galaxy cluster Abell 3376 [31] probably resulting from the\nmegaparsec scale cosmic shock waves associated to the violent collisions of\nsmaller groups of galaxies within the cluster.\n\n\f8\n\nmirDM\n\nprinted on November 5, 2018\n\nFig. 4. Dark matter ring in Cl 0024+17 galaxy cluster.\n\nA mechanism how ringlike structures can be formed during collisions\nwas suggested by Lynds and Toomre [32] many ears ego. When a compact\nintruder approaches with a small impact parameter in a nearly head-on\ncollision to a victim galaxy, the stars of this galaxy, assumed to be in circular\norbits before the collision, experience inward fall due to extra gravity. As the\nintruder moves away, extra gravity disappears and perturbed stars rebound\noutward eventually. At that stars at smaller radii rebound faster and, as a\nresult, stars still moving inward meet rebounders moving outward. The final\noutcome all of this is a ring-shaped compression wave propagating outward\n[33, 34].\nIf the dark matter ring in Cl 0024+17 is created only because of gravitational disturbances during the collision, in the manner of Lynds and\nToomre, it is expected the spatial distribution of cluster galaxies to possess the similar ringlike feature. However a detailed dedicated study found\nno such substructure in the projected two-dimensional galaxy distribution\n[35]. This indicates that probably dark-matter self-interactions and associated shock waves played an important role in the formation of the observed\ndark matter ring.\n\n\fmirDM\n\nprinted on November 5, 2018\n\n9\n\nOn the other hand, the fact that the ring has not been erased in about\n1-2 Gyr after the core impact indicates very small collisional cross-sections\nof dark matter particles, much smaller than expected for ordinary plasma\n[30].\nThe mirror dark matter hypothesis readily explains this seeming contradiction in the behavior of the Cl 0024+17 cluster dark matter. The shock\nwave propagated in the mirror gas of the cluster leads to the intense burst of\nmirror star formation transforming the dark matter ring into the effectively\ncollisionless system of mirror galaxies.\nThis example also indicates how the ordinary and mirror matters could\nto be separated even at galactic scales: mirror galaxies in the dark matter ring of Cl 0024+17 should be composed predominantly by mirror matter. The existence of purely dark matter galaxies with negligible admixture\nof ordinary matter, as well as ordinary galaxies without dark matter, can\ntherefore be envisaged. Interestingly, both dark galaxy [36, 37] and ordinary\ngalaxy without dark matter [38] were presumably discovered.\n6. Hoag's object\nFig.5 shows a very interesting ring galaxy, the so called Hoag's object\n[39]. Yellow spherical nucleus of old stars is surrounded by a nearly perfect\nring of hot blue stars. How this ring was formed is a mystery. Usually ring\ngalaxies are formed by the collision of a small galaxy with a larger diskshaped galaxy through the Lynds and Toomre density wave mechanism.\nHowever, in the case of the Hoag's object there is no sign of any intruder\ngalaxy nearby.\nCuriously, an object is seen inside the Hoag's object's image which looks\nlike a another ring galaxy much like to the Hoag's object itself. Having in\nmind the estimated minuscule fraction, 10\u22123 , of Hoag-type galaxies [40],\nthis seems to be an incredible coincidence. Maybe this odd cosmic irony\noffers a clue about the nature and formation history of the Hoag's object.\nSuppose the intruder galaxy which led to the ring formation was a mirror\ngalaxy. Then we do not expect it to be visible but it should be lurking somewhere there and can reveal itself by its gravitational influence, in particular\nby gravitational lensing of background galaxies suitably aligned behind it\n[41, 42].\nWhat if the smaller ring-galaxy-like structure inside the Hoag's object\nis the result of the gravitational lens of some distant background galaxy due\nto the gravitational field of the mirror galaxy?\nNote that Hoag himself considered a hypothesis that the ring of the\nHoag's object is a gravitational lensing event caused by the gravity of Hoag's\nobject's core [39]. The hypothesis was discarded because it required inordi-\n\n\f10\n\nmirDM\n\nprinted on November 5, 2018\n\nFig. 5. Hoag's object.\n\nnately high mass for the core of the Hoag's object, 1.4 \u00d7 1013 M\u2299 [39, 43],\n11 M [40].\nwhile the inferred mass of the Hoag's object is only 7+5\n\u2299\n\u22123 \u00d7 10\nNowadays we firmly know that the Hoag's object's ring is real, of course,\nbut one cannot be so sure about the much smaller duplicate ring inside. The\napparent size of the secondary ring is a factor of twenty smaller than the\nsize of the main ring. The radius of the Einstein ring is proportional to the\nsquare root of the lensing mass [42]. Therefore, the required lensing mass\nwhich can produce the Einstein ring of the angular size of the secondary\nring is 1.4 \u00d7 1013 M\u2299 /202 \u2248 3.5 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 , maybe just a correct mass for\nthe putative projectile for the Hoag's object formation.\n7. Conclusions\nThere is a growing astrophysical evidence of diverse behaviour of dark\nmatter in galaxy cluster collisions. These observations indicate that the\nmirror dark matter models deserve careful examination and observational\nverification. If the mirror dark matter were as popular as the SUSY dark\n\n\fmirDM\n\nprinted on November 5, 2018\n\n11\n\nmatter, we would say that it is already discovered. However, it would be\nmore fair to conclude that we need more observational evidence to firmly\nprove this fascinating conjecture.\nAcknowledgments\nThe author thanks L. B. Okun for comments.
