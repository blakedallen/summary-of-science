The conventional method of the generalized geometries construction, based on a use of the topology, leads to a overdetermination of the\nRiemannian geometry. In other words, at the Riemannian geometry construction one uses the needless information (topology), which disagrees with\nother original axioms. The crisis manifests in the fact, that the mathematical community cannot see and does not want to see the overdetermination\nof the Riemannian geometry. The most geometers-topologists deny the alternative method of the generalized geometry construction, which does not\nuses the topology, because it does not contain theorems. Most geometers see\nthe geometry presentation as a set of definitions and theorems. They cannot\nimagine the geometry presentation without customary theorems. As a result\nthe most clever topologists, which have acknowledged the negligible role of\nthe topology in the geometry construction and inconsistency of the conventional method of the generalized geometry construction, appear in the difficult\nsituation (conflict with the mathematical community).\n\n1\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nI wrote on crisis in geometry [1]. The fact is that the contemporary (Riemannian)\ngeometry is overdetermined and hence it is inconsistent. Although the character of\ninconsistency is known long ago, the mathematical community as a whole does not\nwant to acknowledge these inconsistencies and bypasses them. The content of the\ncrisis lies in the fact that the mistakes in geometry (more exact in the construction\nof generalized geometries) are not acknowledged and not corrected, but not in the\nexistence of mistakes in themselves. As a result the geometry is developed in the\ndirection, which leads in the blind alley. Why does such a situation take place\nand which are consequences of the crisis? The presented paper is devoted to this\nquestion.\nLet us note that it the second crisis in the geometry. The first crisis took place\nin the second half of the 19th century, when the mathematical community did not\nwant to acknowledge the reality of the non-Euclidean geometries. This crisis had\nexhausted itself somehow, when the non-Euclidean (Riemannian) geometry begun\nto be applied in the general relativity. But the analysis of the crisis reasons has not\nbeen produced (at any rate, I know nothing about such an analysis).\nAt first, I connected an appearance of the crisis with the strongly crusted preconception, that the straight is a one-dimensional line in any generalized geometry.\nIt followed from this statement that the one-dimensional line is the most important\nobject of any generalized geometry. In its turn this fact leads to the conclusion that\nthe topology, founded on the concept of one-dimensional curve, lies in foundation\nof a geometry, and it should be used in construction of a generalized geometry. All\nconventional methods of the geometry construction are founded on the essential employment of the topology. It means that at first one constructs a topological space,\nand the geometry was constructed on the basis of the topological space. Overcoming the preconception on the one-dimensionality of the straight, one can construct a\nmore general and simpler method of the generalized geometries construction. This\nalternative method is founded on the deformation principle [2]. This method admits,\nthat the straight may be a surface (tube), and it does not need the topology [3] for\nconstruction of a generalized geometry. The substance of the alternative method\nmay be expressed by the words: \"Any generalized geometry may be obtained as\na deformation of the proper Euclidean geometry. The alternative method, applied\nfor the Riemannian geometry construction, is free of the well known defects of the\nconventional method, i.e. it does not contain such properties of the Riemannian\ngeometry as absence of the absolute parallelism and the convexity problem. All\nscientists understood that these properties of the Riemannian geometry were its\ndefects, but they could not overcome them without a use of the alternative method.\nThe fact, that the alternative method gives another results than the conventional one, means that at least one of methods is erroneous. To use the conventional\nmethod, one needs many different constraints, restricting a possibility of its application. One needs the dimensionality of the space, its continuity and a continuous\ncoordinate system in it. For application of the alternative method one does not\n2\n\n\fneed neither dimensionality, nor the space continuity. The coordinate system is not\nneeded also. One needs only the distance function \u03c1 (P, Q), or the world function\n\u03c3 (P, Q) = 12 \u03c12 (P, Q), which satisfies the only condition\n\u03c3 (P, P ) = 0\n\n(1.1)\n\n\u03c3 (P, Q) = \u03c3 (Q, P )\n\n(1.2)\n\nEven the symmetry condition\n\nis not an obligatory condition [4]. The alternative method does not contain any logical reasonings, whereas at application of the conventional method of the generalized\ngeometry construction one needs to provide consistency of all used suppositions. It\nneeds the significant efforts. Consistency of all constraints may be provided not\nalways. For the Riemannian geometry the consistency is violated because of the\nsupposition, that the straight is an one-dimensional curve (or because of the application of the topology at the geometry construction, what is essentially the same).\nThe fact is that at construction by means of the right (alternative) method the\ngeodesic, passing through the point P , in parallel to the vector at the point P ,\nis one-dimensional. However, in the case, when the straight (geodesic) is passed\nthrough the point P , in parallel to the vector at the other point P1 , it is not onedimensional, in general [5]. To avoid the non-one-dimensionality of the straight, the\nabsolute parallelism is forbidden in the Riemannian geometry. Thus, it is evident\nthat the alternative method is true, whereas the conventional one is questionable.\nIn the case, when they lead to different results, one should to prefer the alternative\nmethod.\nI believed that the construction of generalized geometries by means of the alternative method, founded on the deformation principle, admits one to perceive the\ninadmissibility of the topology application at the generalized geometry construction. But I appeared to be not right in the relation, that I considered the onedimensionality as an only preconception preventing from the correct construction of\nthe generalized geometry. It appears, that there is once more preconception. I did\nnot guess about this preconception, because I did not meet it at the construction\nof the tubular geometry (T-geometry), i.e. the geometry constructed on the basis\nof the deformation principle. I met the preconception on the one-dimensionality of\nstraight at construction of the T-geometry and expended thirty years to overcome\nit [1]. One can obtain a representation on these preconceptions from consideration\nof following two syllogisms:\n1. According to Euclid the straight is one-dimensional in the Euclidean geometry,\nhence, the straight is one-dimensional in any generalized geometry.\n2. Euclid constructed his geometry, formulating and proving theorems, hence,\nany generalized geometry should be constructed, formulating and proving theorems.\nFrom the viewpoint of logic the considered syllogisms are not valid, especially\nif one takes into account the opinion of the ancient Egyptians, supposed that all\nrevers flow northward. Their viewpoint may be considered as a corollary of the\nthird syllogism:\n3\n\n\f3. The great river Nile flows northward, hence all revers flow northward.\nThe structure of all three syllogisms is the same. They transform a partial\ncase into the general one without a sufficient foundations. Such a generalization\nis connected with a narrowness of our experience. There is only one (Euclidean)\ngeometry, and the straight in this geometry is one-dimensional. There is the only\ngeometry, and it constructed by means of formulation and proof of theorems. Finally,\nthe ancient Egyptians knew only one river Nile.\nThe logical inconsistency of syllogisms did not prevent mathematicians from\napplication of them at construction of any generalized geometry, because in the\ngiven case the mathematicians used in their practical activity the associations, but\nnot a logic. In all considered cases we deal with the only object. In this case\nit is very difficult to distinguish, which properties belong to the object in itself\nand which properties belong to the method of the object description. When the\nmethod of description is considered to be a property of the object in itself, we\nobtain a preconception. The first syllogism is a reason of the preconception on onedimensionality of the straight. (The method of the straight description, used by\nEuclid, was acknowledged as the property of the straight in itself). I knew about\nthis preconception, because I was forced to overcome it. The second syllogism\nbecame to be a foundation of the preconception, that all activity of a geometers\nconsists in a formulation and a proof of theorems. (Euclid described the geometry\nby means of theorems, hence description in terms of theorems is a property of the\ngeometry. If there are no theorems, then there is no geometry.) I had met the second\npreconception at the following circumstances.\nI have submitted my report [3] to the seminar of one of geometric-topological\nchairs of the Moscow Lomonosov University. It took place in 2001, and my paper [3]\nwas not yet published. I came to the secretary of the seminar, told him about my\nwish to read a report and gave him the text of the paper. Skimming my paper the\nsecretary of the seminar said thoughtfully: \"How strange geometry! No theorems!\nOnly definitions! I believe that it will be not interesting for us.\" One of leading\ngeometers, which was forced duty bound to read my paper (the paper was, submitted\nto the International conference on geometry, which took place in Saint-Petersburg\nin the summer of 2002) said me in private conversation, that he had understood\nnothing in my paper, because it contained neither axioms, nor theorems. In that\ntime I did not understand his objections. It was quite unclear for me, how one cannot\nunderstand such a simple conception as the T-geometry, which did not contain any\nlogical reasonings. Only essentially later I had understand, that here we deal with\na preconception. Mathematicians distinguish from other peoples in the relation,\nthat they perceive the geometry exclusively via its formalism. Further I shall try\nto show formally, how theorems are transformed into definitions, and the demand\nof the geometry representation in the form of a set of theorems is not more, than a\npreconception.\nSpeaking about social consequences of the crisis, I keep in mind as follows. Now\nthe topology is considered to be the most perspective direction of the geometry\ndevelopment. All best geometers are concentrated in the development of this direc4\n\n\ftion. Having overcame the preconception on the one-dimensionality of the straight\nand discovering the alternative method of the geometry construction, the topology\nappears to be a cul-de-sac direction in the geometry development. Many papers\non verification of the geometry on the basis of topology appear to be depreciated.\nHowever, these papers are considered to be important and perspective as long as\nthe mathematicians do not want to take into account the alternative method and\ndo not acknowledge inconsistencies in the Riemannian geometry.\nLet us imagine the following situation. A young talented topologist N has solved\na very difficult topological problem. A prestige international prize is declared for\nsolution of this problem. Solving the problem and publishing the results, the topologist N discovers suddenly, that the problem is set incorrectly, because the topology\nis founded on concepts of the Riemannian geometry, but the Riemannian geometry\nis overdetermined (i.e. it is inconsistent). The topologist N is awarded this prize\nquite deservedly, because one did not find mistakes in his solution. But, if the problem is stated incorrectly, it may have no correct solution at all, because different\nmethods of solution may lead to different results. The mathematical community\nconsidered that the prize has been awarded correctly, but the topologist N disagree\nwith the opinion of the mathematical community, as far as he understand, that his\nwork may be considered as outstanding one, as long as the mathematical community did not discover the weakness of the ground of the solved problem. What does\nthe topologists N do? If he is a conformist, he may affect ignorance, that he does\nnot discover any incorrectness in the statement of the problem and get quietly the\nawarded deserved prize. (Whilom the inconsistency of the Riemannian geometry\nwill be discovered!). It is impossible to prove, that he has known about inconsistency of the Riemannian geometry. However, the following problem remain before\nthe topologist N. Further some of his previous papers will be depreciated. How and\nwhat for to work in the region of the topological verification of the geometry, if this\ndirection leads to the blind alley?\nHowever, if the topologist N is a scrupulous scientists, but not a conformist, he\nhas only one possibility: to keep away from the opinion of the mathematical community and to abandon from the awarded prize. Should he declare the reason of\nhis decision? It is not a simple question. Declaring the reason of his decision, the\ntopologist N conflicts with the mathematical community, which does not acknowledge the Riemannian inconsistency at this moment. In his time the great Gauss\ndid not risk to conflict with the mathematical community on the question of the\nnon-Euclidean geometry existence. (According to information of the Felix Klein [6]\none discovered unpublished manuscripts of Gauss on the non-Euclidean geometry\namong his papers). However, Gauss worked in many different branches mathematics, he may admit himself to neglect his works in the non-Euclidean geometry. The\ncontemporary topologists works, as a rule, only in topology. Acknowledgment of\ninconsistencies in the Riemannian geometry is a drama for a topologist. At the\nsame time such an acknowledgment is a very fearless act.\nI suspect, that even if the topologists N discussed inconsistency of the Riemannian geometry with his colleagues, he may meet an incomprehension. I have the\n5\n\n\ffollowing reason for such a suspicion. In the summer 2002 the international conference, devoted to the anniversary of the known Russian geometer A.D. Alexandrov,\ntook place in Saint-Petersburg. Submitting the corresponding report [4], I arrived at\nthe conference. However, the main goal of my participation in the work of the conference was not my report, which appeared to be interesting for nobody. I wanted to\ndiscuss with leading geometers of Russia a possibility of the alternative method of\nthe Riemannian geometry construction, which concerns the geometry foundation. It\nwas important for me, because I am not a mathematician, but a physicist - theorist.\nI succeeded to discuss this question with some leading geometers, but nobody did\nnot understood me (More exactly, only one person had understood me, but he was\nnot a geometer. He was simply a collaborator of the Saint-Petersburg branch of\nMathematical institute, where the conference took place). The leading geometers\ntold me very polite, that the question of the geometry foundation had been solved\nmany years ago by Hilbert and other great geometers. In the present time the problem of the geometry foundation is interesting for nobody. In this discussion only the\nquestion on the alternative method of the geometry construction was considered.\nThe question of the Riemannian geometry inconsistency was not discussed.\nIn other time I wanted to discuss the paper [3] at the seminar of the well known\nmathematician, who had usually a preliminary talk with the potential speaker. During this talk I mentioned that the result of application of the alternative method of\nthe Riemannian geometry construction disagree at some points with the results of\napplication of the conventional method. According to my representation, this fact\nmust intrigue the leader of the seminar in discussion of my report. However, I was\ntold immediately, that the Riemannian geometry cannot be inconsistent. Our talk\nwas finished after this declaration.\nSummarizing, I should note that the more talented the topologist, the earlier\nhe faces the inconsistency of the Riemannian geometry, lying in the foundation of\nthe topology and makes the necessary conclusions. A failure in his scientific career\nmay be a result of this inconsistency. Let me note, that the Riemannian geometry\ninconsistencies may be manifested only on the sufficiently high level of the geometry (topology) development, when new contradictions (other than the convexity\nproblem and the fernparallelism problem) appear. This does not concern the standard formalism of the Riemannian geometry (metric tensor, covariant derivatives,\ncurvature, etc.).\nAt first site the drama in the scientific career of the topologist N seem to be\nunreal. However, it has taken place already, puzzling the mathematical community, because nobody cannot imagine that the reason lies not in the character of\nthe topologist N, but in the crisis, which the talented topologist has acknowledged\nearlier, than other scientists. His behavior in the given situation was very dignified, although it was not clear for his colleagues. I shall not denominate the name\nof this topologist, although persons close to mathematics and topology may easily\ndetermine it.\nFarther the pure mathematical questions will be considered, which explain my\nstatement on the overdetermination of the Riemannian geometry. The second sec6\n\n\ftion is devoted to comparison of the conventional method of the generalized geometry\nconstruction with the alternative one. In the third section the question on the Riemannian geometry inconsistency is considered. In the fourth section one considers\nwhy the mathematicians discard the T-geometry, constructed on the basis of the\ndeformation principle.\n\n2\n\nComparison of the conventional and alternative\nmethods of the geometry construction\n\nThe conventional method of the Riemannian geometry is as follows. One considers m-dimensional surfaces in the n-dimensional Euclidean space (m < n). Those\nproperties of m-dimensional surfaces, which do not depend on the dimension n of\nthe accommodating Euclidean space, declared to be an internal geometry of the\nm-dimensional surface. It is the Riemannian geometry of the m-dimensional space.\nThe Riemannian geometries are restricted by the constraint, that the Riemannian\nspace can be embedded isometrically into the Euclidean space of sufficiently large\ndimension. The geometry which cannot be embedded isometrically in the Euclidean\nspace, cannot be constructed by this method. Besides the Riemannian geometries\nare continuous, that is connected with the application of the continuous coordinate\nsystem at the construction of the Riemannian geometry. A use of the conventional\nmethod of the generalized geometry construction, i.e. the geometry more general,\nthan the Riemannian one, contains a series of resricitions on the generalized geometry. In particular, such a constraint is the embeddability of the space with the\ngeneralized geometry into the Euclidean space of the sufficiently large dimension.\nBesides, such a generalized geometry contains such a characteristic of the geometry\nas the dimension, which is a natural number n. Necessity of some dimension n at\nthe generalized geometry seems to be something as a matter-of-course, although, in\nreality the dimension is a corollary of the applied method of the generalized geometry construction, when one uses the concept of a manifold, which is a coordinate\nsystem, consisting n independent coordinates. The fact, that the dimension is not\na necessary property of the generalized geometry (it is rather the means of description), follows from the fact that there is an alternative method of the generalized\ngeometry description, where the concept of dimension may be not introduced.\nThe alternative method of the generalized geometry description is founded on the\ndeformation principle, which states that any generalized geometry can be obtained\nas a result of a deformation of the proper Euclidean geometry. Any deformation\nmeans a change of distance between the points of the space. Any deformation of\nthe proper Euclidean space generates some generalized geometry. It is produced\nas follows. One proves the theorem, that the proper Euclidean geometry may be\nformulated in terms and only in terms of the world function [3]. (The world function\nis a half of the squared distance between the two points of the space). It follows\nfrom the theorem, that any geometrical object OE and any statement RE of the\nproper Euclidean geometry GE can be expressed in terms of the world function \u03c3 E\n7\n\n\fof the Euclidean geometry GE in the form OE (\u03c3 E ) and RE (\u03c3 E ) respectively. The\nset of all geometrical objects OE (\u03c3 E ) and relations RE (\u03c3 E ) between them forms the\nEuclidean geometry GE . To obtain the corresponding relations of the generalized\ngeometry G it is sufficient to replace the world function \u03c3 E of the proper Euclidean\ngeometry with the world function \u03c3 of the generalized geometry G:\nOE (\u03c3 E ) \u2192 OE (\u03c3) ,\n\nRE (\u03c3 E ) \u2192 RE (\u03c3)\n\nThen the set of all geometrical objects OE (\u03c3) and relations RE (\u03c3) between them\nforms the generalized geometry G.\nThe alternative method of the geometry construction supposes, that the generalized geometry G is determined completely by its world function, and any statement\nof the generalized geometry G can be obtained from the corresponding statement of\nthe Euclidean geometry. In this case for construction of the generalized geometry G\none does not need a coordinate system. One does not need either its dimension, or\nany another information on topology of the generalized geometry G. The dimension\nand topology (if they exist) can be obtained from the world function \u03c3 of the generalized geometry G. The method of determination of the dimension is a such one,\nthat the dimension may be different at different points of the space, or the dimension may be not exist at all. It means that the definition of the topology and of the\ndimension independently of the world function is inconsistent, in general. Thus, the\nconventional method of the generalized geometry construction is overdetermined. It\ncontains too many axioms, which are not independent. The suggested alternative\nmethod is insensitive to the continuity or discreteness of the geometry, as far as it\nuses nowhere the limiting transition or continuous coordinate system. A use of the\nconventional method of the geometry construction, when one postulates some axiom\nsystem, which determines the generalized geometry, appears to be ineffective, because it is very difficult to provide compatibility of original axioms. The demand of\ntheir compatibility imposes unnecessary constraints upon the obtained generalized\ngeometries.\nFor instance, a construction of the Riemannian geometry may be realized by two\nmethods. Using the conventional method on the basis of the metric tensor, giving\non the n-dimensional manifold, one obtains the Riemannian geometry GR . Using the\nalternative method based on the deformation principle, one obtains \u03c3-Riemannian\ngeometry G\u03c3R . Prefix \u03c3 means, that the generalized geometry G\u03c3R has the property\nof \u03c3-immanence (\u03c3-immanence is the property of the geometry to be described\ncompletely by the world function \u03c3). If the world function \u03c3 is the same in geometries\nGR and G\u03c3R , the obtained generalized geometries GR and G\u03c3R are very close, but they\ndistinguish in some details. For instance, in the \u03c3-Riemannian geometry G\u03c3R there\nis the absolute parallelism (fernparallelism), whereas in the Riemannian geometry\nGR one fails to introduce the absolute parallelism. The fact is that the concept of\nparallelism of two vectors in the Riemannian geometry GR is transitive according\nto the geometry construction [7, 2]. In the \u03c3-Riemannian geometry G\u03c3R there is\nan absolute parallelism, which is intransitive, but the parallelism of two vectors at\nthe same point is transitive. Thus, if one introduces the absolute parallelism in the\n8\n\n\fRiemannian geometry, it will be intransitive, in general, and incompatible with the\noriginal statement on the transitivity of the parallelism in Riemannian geometry. To\navoid inconsistency, one declares that in the framework of the Riemannian geometry\none cannot introduce the absolute parallelism of vectors, placed at different points\nof the space.\nThe considered example shows that the conventional method of the generalized\ngeometry construction is overdetermined. Furthermore, if the proper Euclidean\ngeometry is considered to be as a special case of the Riemannian geometry, and\none constructs it in the same way, as one constructs the Riemannian geometry,\nthe proper Euclidean geometry acquires an absurd property. If some region of the\nspace is nonconvex, the Riemannian geometry, constructed in this region with the\nEuclidean metric tensor, is not the Euclidean geometry, in general, because some\ndistances in such a geometry are determined not along the straight lines of the\nEuclidean geometry, but along lines belonging partly to the boundary of the region.\nThe obtained Riemannian space cannot be embedded, in general, isometrically into\nthe Euclidean space, although the nonconvex region is a part of the Euclidean space.\nThis absurd result shows, that the system of axioms of the conventional method\nof the generalized geometry construction is overdetermined. An application of the\noverdetermined method of the generalized geometry construction leads, in general, to\ninconsistency. The form of these inconsistencies depends essentially on the method,\nhow these axioms are used.\n\n3\n\nOn inconsistency of the Riemannian geometry\n\nSome defects of the Riemannian geometry, were known years ago, but somehow they\nare not perceived as inconsistency of the axiom system, which determines the conventional construction of the Riemannian geometry. (Apparently, it is conditioned\nwith the absence of the alternative method of the generalized geometry construction). For instance, if one constructs the Riemannian geometry as a special case of\nthe Riemannian one, using the conventional method of the Riemannian geometry,\nthe convexity problem appears, consisting in the fact, that a nonconvex region of\nthe Euclidean plane cannot be embedded isometrically, in general, in the Euclidean\nplane, from which it is cut. The result is evidently absurd. However, for the convex\nregion such an embedding is possible, mathematicians bypass this defect, considering geometries only on convex manifolds. (For instance, the book of A.D.Alexandrov\n\"Internal geometry of convex surfaces\"). Another defect is the problem of the fernparallelism, i.e. absence of definition of the parallelism of remote vectors in the\nRiemannian geometry. This fact is not considered as a defect of the Riemannian\ngeometry also. In reality these defects are corollaries of the overdetermination of\nthe Riemannian geometry, i.e. at the Riemannian geometry construction one uses\nmore axioms, than it is necessary for the geometry construction. Some axioms are\nincompatible between themselves, or they are compatible only at some constraints,\nimposed on the geometry. In principle, this overdetermination may lead to another\n9\n\n\fcontradictions, which are not known now. The overdetermination of the conventional method of the Riemannian geometry construction has been discovered after\nappearance of the alternative method, using essentially less amount of information,\nwhich is necessary for the geometry construction. The alternative method of the\ngeometry construction does not contain overdetermination, the convexity problem,\nthe problem of fernparallelism and other defects, which are corollaries of this overdetermination.\nThe main preconception, preventing the contemporary geometry from its development, is the statement that the straight is a one-dimensional line in any generalized geometry (the straight has no width) has been traced to Euclid. It is true in\nthe Riemannian geometry for the straight, passing through the point P , in parallel to a vector at the point P . However, in the case, when the straight (geodesic)\npasses through the point P in parallel to a vector at another point P1 , it is not onedimensional, in general, [5]. To avoid the non-one-dimensionality of the straight, the\nfernparallelism (i.e. the concept of parallelism of two remote vectors) is forbidden\nin the Riemannian geometry. The one-dimensionality of the straight may not be\nincluded in axiomatics of a generalized geometry. The one-dimensionality of the\nstraight may not be used at the generalized geometry construction, because it may\nappear to be incompatible with other axioms. (Forbidding the fernparallelism, one\ndid not think on a possible non-one-dimensionality of the straight. Simply an ambiguity in the definition of the parallelism contradicted to the axiomatics and seems\nto be unacceptable). Forbidding fernparallelism and the geometry on non-convex\nmanifolds, one can avoid a manifestation of the Riemannian geometry inconsistency.\nHowever, it does not avoid the inconsistency in itself, because it may appear in other\nform. In the case of arbitrary generalized geometry the character of the straight\n(one-dimensional line, or multidimensional surface) is determined by the form of the\nworld function, and one does need to make suppositions on the one-dimensionality,\nor on non-one-dimensionality of the straight. Furthermore, one cannot demand\nthe one-dimensionality of the straight, because it leads to an overdetermination of\nconditions of the generalized geometry construction, and as a corollary to their inconsistency, or to a restriction of the class of possible geometries. Application of\nthe topology at the generalized geometry construction supposes that a curve (and\nits kind a straight) is one-dimensional. It is a reason, why the topology may not\nbe used at the generalized geometry construction. Overcoming of this preconception was very difficult. I personally needed almost thirty years for overcoming this\npreconception (a description of the path of this overcoming can be found in [1]), although I have an experience of successful overcoming of like preconception in other\nbranches of physics.\nAlthough the overcoming of the preconception on the one-dimensionality of the\nstraight was difficult, I hoped, that, being elucidated it will be perceived and overcame by the mathematical community. It appeared, that I was wrong in this relation.\nThe overcoming of the perception was very difficult ( by the way, it was difficult also\nin the case of the preconception on the statistical description). Apparently, overcoming of preconceptions is always difficult. Besides, it appeared, that besides of\n10\n\n\fthe main preconception on the one-dimensionality of the straight there are another\npreconceptions. For instance, one supposes, that any presentation of a geometry is\na set of axioms and theorems and that the geometer's activity is a formulation and\na proof of theorems.\n\n4\n\nWhy mathematicians do not acknowledge\nT-geometry constructed on the basis of the\ndeformation principle?\n\nThe relation of the most mathematicians to the alternative method of the geometry construction, which is based on the deformation principle is negative as a rule,\nalthough they cannot contradict anything against this method. Indeed, it as very\ndifficult to contradict anything, because of the simplicity of the alternative method,\nwhich does not contain any suppositions except for the sufficiently evident deformation principle. Nevertheless, the refereed mathematical journals reject papers on the\ngeneralized geometry construction founded on basis of the deformation principle. In\nthe paper [1] it is described in detail, how such a rejection is produced. My attempts\nof reporting these papers at the seminars of topologists - geometers are rejected also.\nHowever, my papers were reported and discussed at the seminar on the geometry as\na whole in the Moscow Lomonosov University. This seminar was founded by N.V.\nEfimov.\nIn the present time the topological approach to the problem of the generalized\ngeometry construction dominates. One supposes, that it is necessary at first to construct a proper topological space. In the topological space one introduces a metric\nand constructs a generalized geometry. Construction of the generalized geometries\non the basis of the deformation principle depreciates essentially papers on geometry,\nand the mathematicians, constructing generalized geometries by the conventional\nmethod, were not enthused over the prospect. As far as they cannot suggest any\nessential objection against the deformation principle because of its simplicity and\neffectiveness, they use another methods of resistance, generating doubts in the scientific scrupulosity of advocates of the conventional method. One of them is described\nin [1] in detail.\nOf course, I have known, how strongly we believe, that the straight line is always an one-dimensional geometrical object, because this preconception retarded\nmy discovery of the T-geometry almost with thirty years. However, discovery of the\nnon-one-dimensionality of the straight and incomprehension of such a possibility,\nwhen the non-one-dimensionality has been already discovered, seemed to be different things for me. It was appeared that a perception of the deformation principle\nis the more difficult, the better the person knows the geometry in its contemporary\nformal presentation. The fact is that the mathematicians perceive all things via the\nformalism. The associative perception like a reference to the deformation principle\nconveys little to them.\n11\n\n\fThe strangers and the mathematicians perceive the geometry presentation as a\nformulation and proof of different geometric theorems. Replacement of theorems\nwith definitions seems to them as anything quite obscure. However, in reality, the\nformulation and the proof of theorems is only one of the methods of work with\ndifferent geometric statements (axioms and theorems). The proof of theorems is the\nmost laborious part of work. As a result one gets an impression, that the geometry\npresentation is a proof of theorems (if there are no theorems, there is no geometry).\nBut there are another methods of work with the geometric statements, which does\nnot distinguish between the axioms and theorems.(There is no necessity to repeat\nthe work of Euclid, one should use results of his work.) At such a method of work\nthe theorems are replaced by definitions, and a necessity of their proof falls off.\nI shall explain this in the example of the cosine theorem, which states\n|BC|2 = |AB|2 + |AC|2 \u2212 2 (AB.AC)\n= |AB|2 + |AC|2 \u2212 2 |AB| |AC| cos \u03b1\n\n(4.1)\n\nwhere the points A, B, C are vertices of a triangle, |BC|, |AB|, |AC| are lengths of\nthe triangle sides and \u03b1 is the angle \u2221BAC. The relation (4.1) is the cosine theorem\nwhich is proved on the basis of the axioms of the proper Euclidean geometry.\nUsing expression of the length of the triangle side AB via the world function \u03c3\np\n|AB| = 2\u03c3 (A, B)\n(4.2)\nwe may rewrite the relation (4.1) in the form\n(AB.AC) = \u03c3 (A, B) + \u03c3 (A, C) \u2212 \u03c3 (B, C)\n\n(4.3)\n\nThe relation (4.3) is a definition of the scalar product (AB.AC) of two vectors AB\nand AC in the T-geometry. Thus, the theorem is replaced by the definition of a\nnew concept (the scalar product), which is not connected directly with the concept\nof the linear space.\nAnother example the Pythagorean theorem for the rectangular triangle ABC\nwith the right angle \u2221BAC, which is written in the form\n|BC|2 = |AB|2 + |AC|2\n\n(4.4)\n\nIn T-geometry instead of the theorem (4.4) we have a definition of the right angle\u2221BAC.\nIn terms of the world function this definition has the form. The angle \u2221BAC is right,\nif the relation\n\u03c3 (A, B) + \u03c3 (A, C) \u2212 \u03c3 (B, C) = 0\n(4.5)\ntakes place\nThus, we see that theorems of the proper Euclidean geometry are replaced by\ndefinitions of T-geometry.\nFrom the formal viewpoint the difference between the conventional method of description and the alternative method may be described as follows. The conventional\n12\n\n\fmethod of the proper Euclidean geometry may be described as a set SE (A [RE ])\nof algorithms A [RE ], acting on operands RE , where operands RE are geometrical objects or relations of the Euclidean geometry. The operands RE depend on\nparameters P n \u2261 {P0 , P0 , .., Pn }, where P0 , P0 , .., Pn are points of the space.\nRE = RE (P n )\n\n(4.6)\n\nAs far as all geometrical objects and relations RE can be expressed via the world\nfunction \u03c3 E of the Euclidean geometry GE , one may rewrite the relation (4.6) in the\nform\nRE = RE (P n ) = R\u0303E [\u03c3 E (P n )]\n(4.7)\nwhere \u03c3 E (P n ) is a set of world functions \u03c3 E (Pi , Pk ) , Pi , Pk \u2208 P n .\nTaking into account the relation (4.7), one can represent the set S\u0010E (A\nh [RE ]) of all i\u0011\nn\nn\nalgorithms A [RE (P )] in the form of the set SE (A [RE (P )]) = SE A R\u0303E [\u03c3 E (P n )] =\ni\ni\u0011\nh\n\u0010 h\nSE A R\u0303\u2032E,P n [\u03c3 E ] of all algorithms Ae [\u03c3 E ] = A R\u0303\u2032E,P n [\u03c3 E ] . In the Euclidean ge\u0010 h\ni\u0011\nn\n\u2032\ne\nometry the set of all algorithms SE (A [RE (P )]) takes the form SE A R\u0303E,P n [\u03c3 E ] .\nIn the generalized geometry G,\nby\ni\u0011the world function \u03c3, the set of all\n\u0010 described\nh\n\u2032\ne\nalgorithms takes the form SE A R\u0303E,P n [\u03c3] . It means that the set of all algoi\u0011\n\u0010 h\nrithms SE Ae R\u0303\u2032E,P n [\u03c3] for any generalized geometry is obtained from the set\n\u0010 h\ni\u0011\n\u2032\ne\nSE A R\u0303E,P n [\u03c3 E ] of all algorithms for the Euclidean geometry by means of replacement of the operand of algorithms \u03c3 E \u2192 \u03c3. The form of all algorithms is not\nchanged. This is the formal description of the action of the deformation principle.\nFor construction of the generalized geometry one needs no theorems and no logical\nreasonings. The main part of the work of construction of the generalized geometry\nconsists\nin transformation\nof known Euclidean algorithms A [RE (P n )] to the form\ni\nh\nAe R\u0303\u2032E,P n [\u03c3 E ] , where all algorithms are represented in terms of the Euclidean world\nfunction.\nIn the T-geometry a construction of new generalized geometry is produced by\nthe same algorithms, as in the proper Euclidean geometry. One replaces only the\nworld function, i.e. operand of algorithms \u03c3 E \u2192 \u03c3. One does not need theorems\nwhich connect different objects of geometry. One uses the definition of the geometrical object or the relation of the Euclidean geometry, expressed directly via world\nfunction. For instance, the scalar product of two vectors is defined by the relation\n(4.3) in all T-geometries. The right angle \u2221BAC is defined by the relation (4.5) in\nall T-geometries. There are no necessity to introduce couplings (theorems) between\ndifferent geometrical concepts, as far as they are expressed via world function.\nIn T-geometry the main problem is an obtaining of expressions for different\ngeometrical concepts and objects via the world function. As far as these expressions\nare the same for all T-geometries, it is sufficient to obtain these expressions in\nthe framework of the proper Euclidean geometry. Thus, instead of formulation of\n13\n\n\fdifferent theorems for different generalized geometries, the geometer must express\nall concepts and objects of the proper Euclidean geometry via the world function.\nThe formalism of T-geometry distinguishes essentially from the conventional formalism of the generalized geometry construction by the object of consideration. In\nthe conventional formalism the geometrical objects and primarily the straight are\nobjects of consideration. The conventional construction of the generalized geometry\nis a repetition of the Euclid's construction, which is produced on the basis of other\naxioms. The true choice of axioms is the main problem of the conventional method\nof the geometry construction. In the alternative method, based on the deformation\nprinciple, the object of consideration is the world function (but not geometrical objects), i.e. a function of two points of the space. It is essentially simpler object of\nconsideration. However, the rules of work (logic of investigation [8]) with the world\nfunction are very complicated. It is very complicated to guess these rules, because\nthey are determined by the Euclidean geometry. Primarily one guesses the rules\nof work with the most simple object: the straight line. As a matter of fact, they\nwere not guessed, they have been taken from the Euclidean geometry. But, to take\nthem, the Euclidean geometry is to be presented in terms of the world function. It\nmeans that it was necessary to construct the formalism on the basis of the world\nfunction. Construction of the formalism, founded on the world function, was difficult. It needed about forty years. Thirty years of these forty years were lost for\nthe overcoming the preconception on the one-dimensionality of straight. Different\nstages of this formalism construction are described in [1].\nApparently, the most difficult and uncustomary for geometers - professionals\nare the facts, that a new object of consideration (world function) appears and the\nconventional objects of consideration (geometrical objects) turn into the logic (algorithm) of investigation. This transition from one method of investigation to another\nis difficult for perception of the geometers - professionals. However, it is essentially\neasier for non- professionals, who do not know, or know skin-deep the conventional\nmethod of the geometry construction. They do not need to compare both methods, overcoming complex of concepts of the conventional method and the formalism,\nconnected with this method.\nConstructing geometry on the basis of the deformation principle, it seems that\nthe formalism is absent, in general, as far as the theorems are absent. (The geometers became accustomed that the geometric formalism appears only in the form of\ntheorem.) In reality the formalism appears in the implicit form as a reference to the\nEuclidean geometry with its formalism. The formalism of the Euclidian geometry\nis modified at the replacement of the world function of the Euclidean space (Algorithms retain, only operand of algorithms is changed). Besides, for a realization of\nsuch a modification the Euclidean geometry is to be presented in the terms of the\nworld function. Mathematicians know slightly this presentation, based on the world\nfunction formalism. Despite the evidence of the deformation principle, I obtained\nit, when the generalized geometry (T-geometry), based on its application, has been\nalready constructed. Furthermore, appearance of the world function formalism (description of the Riemannian geometry in terms of the world function) takes priority\n14\n\n\fof the T-geometry construction.\n\n5\n\nApplication of T-geometry physical problems\n\nBesides, the overdetermination, appearing at a use of the conventional (topological)\nmethod of the geometry construction, this methods is not enough general. The\nmethod of the geometry construction based on the deformation principle, admits\none to construct the generalized geometry, using deformation transforming the onedimensional line into a surface. Although the everyday experience does not provide\nan example of such deformations, such deformations exist. Such a deformation may\nbe described as follows. Let us imagine a beam of straight thin elastic wires of the\nsame length. Being collected in a beam they represent a segment of the straight\nline. Let us grasp the ends of wires by two hands and move hands one to another.\nAt such a deformation the wires diverge, conserving their lengths, and form an\ninswept surface. In other words, although deformations turning a one-dimensional\nline into a surface are possible, the Riemannian geometry and the metrical one\nignore them, preferring to remain in the framework of deformations, conserving onedimensionality of the straight. A use of the Euclidean concept of the straight, as a\nsecond base concept of the geometry, and consideration of the one-dimensionality of\nthe straight do not admit one to prove out the deformation principle. The way to the\ndeformation principle lies through the construction of the mathematical formalism,\nbased on the application of the world function.\nApplying the described above deformation to the construction of the space-time\ngeometry [5], one succeeded to construct such a geometry, where the motion of free\nparticles is primordially stochastic, and intensity of the stochasticity depends on the\nparticle mass. After proper choice of the parameters of the space-time deformation\n(it depends on the quantum constant) the statistical description of free stochastic\nparticles appears to be equivalent to the quantum description. [9]. It is important,\nthat the quantum principles are not used. In other words, the quantum properties\nare descried by means of the correctly chosen space-time geometry. It is impossible in the framework of the Riemannian geometry as well as in the framework of\nany generalized geometry, constructed by means of the conventional method of the\ngeneralized geometry construction.\n\nReferences\n[1] Yu.A.
