Introduction\nThroughout this paper Ef (t) denotes the t-level set\nln |f (z)| = t\n\n(1)\n\nof an analytic function f (z).\nOur starting point is the polynomial lemniscates. Let f (z) be a monic\npolynomial P (z) = z n + a1 z n\u22121 + . . .+ an , n \u2265 2. In 1958 Erd\u00f6s, Herzog and\nPiranian [13] posed a number of problems concentrated around the metric\nproperties of lemniscates (see also the later paper [12]). Among them is the\nfollowing\n1\n\nThe author was supported the G\u00f6ran Gustafsson foundation and grant RFBR\nno. 03-01-00304.\n2\n\nThe author was supported by Russian President grant for young doctorates\nno. 00-15-99274 and grant RFBR no. 03-01-00304.\nKuznetsova O.S., Tkachev V.G.: Royal Institute of Technology, Lindstedtsv\u00e4gen\n25, 10044 Stockholm, Sweden,\nVolgograd State University, 2-ya Prodolnaya 30, Volgograd, 400062 Russia\n(e-mail: astra1987@mail.ru, e-mail: tkatchev@math.kth.se)\nMathematics Subject Classification (2000): 30E05, 42A82, 44A10\n\n\f2\n\nKuznetsova O.S. and Tkachev V.G.\n\nErd\u00f6s Conjecture (Problem 12, [13]; Problem VI, [12]). For fixed\ndegree n of P , is the length of the lemniscate |P (z)| = 1 greatest in the\ncase where P (z) = Qn (z) := z n \u2212 1? Is the length at least 2\u03c0, if EP (0) is\nconnected?\nThe actual breakthrough in the Erd\u00f6s conjecture was made recently by\nA. Eremenko and W. Hayman in [14]. They proved that for any degree\nn there exist a polynomial P \u2217 (z) which maximizes the length of EP (0)\n(following [14], we call it an extremal polynomial); moreover, the estimate\ncn \u2261 max |EP (0)| \u2264 An\ndeg P =n\n\nholds, where |E| denotes the length of E, and A \u2248 9.173. One can readily\ncheck that the conjectural value is |EQn (0)| = 2n+O(1). The previous upper\nestimates were due to Ch. Pommerenke [28]: cn \u2264 74n2 and P. Borwein [6]:\ncn \u2264 8\u03c0en.\nAnother important results of [14] states that the lemniscate EP \u2217 (0) is\nalways connected and for any degree n there exists an extremal polynomial\nP \u2217 such that all its critical points belong to EP \u2217 (0).\nConcerning the first part of Erd\u00f6s conjecture, which is still unsolved,\nT. Erdelyi writes that \"this problem seems almost impossible to settle\"\n[11, p. 8]. Another difficulty in the study of the problem is the absence of\nany explicit formulae for the length function |EP (t)| (except for the trivial\npolynomials P (z) = (z \u2212 a)n ). This question was initially posed by Piranian\nin [26] for the rose-type polynomials Qn ; explicit formulae of |EQn (t)| were\nobtained by Butler [7] and Elia [9].\nThe second part of Erd\u00f6s conjecture is related to the lower estimate of\n|EP (0)| for so-called K-polynomials, i.e. the polynomials with connected\nlemniscate EP (0). This problem was solved in affirmative by Pommerenke\nin [27], who established that\nmin\n\nP \u2208K, deg P =n\n\n|EP (0)| = |E(z\u2212a)n (0)| = 2\u03c0.\n\n(2)\n\n1.1. Main results\nDefinition 1. By a lemniscate region of f we mean a triple (U, f, I) where\nf (z) is an analytic function, U is a component of the set\nU f (I) := {z \u2208 C : a < ln |f (z)| < b},\nI = (a, b), such that for every t \u2208 I the set\nEU ,f (t) := Ef (t) \u2229 U\nis compact in Ef (t). A lemniscate region will called regular if U contains no\nzeroes and no critical points, i.e.f (z)f \u2032 (z) 6= 0 in U (cf. [18, p. 264]).\n\n\fLength functions of lemniscates\n\n3\n\nIt is easy to see that any (analytic) function f admits regular lemniscate\nregions provided that the set of zeroes\nZ(f ) := {z : f (z) = 0}\nis nonempty. Disregarding the polynomial case, where all lemniscates are\ncompact curves, we mention, for instance, an example of a regular lemniscate\nregion (the corresponding lemniscate family is drawn on Figure 1)\n\u03c0\nf (z) = sin z,\nI = (\u2212\u221e, 0),\nU = {z : 0 < | sin z| < 1, | Re z| < }.\n2\n0.8\n0.6\ny\n\n0.4\n0.2\n\n\u20131.5\n\n\u20131\n\n\u20130.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n\u20130.2\nx\n\u20130.4\n\u20130.6\n\u20130.8\n\nFig. 1. The regular lemniscate region for f (z) = sin z\n\nBy its definition, the projection ln |f (z)| : U \u2192 I is a proper map. Hence,\nin case of a regular lemniscate region, the level set EU ,f (t) splits into a finite\ncollection of simple closed curves; any finite collection of closed components\nof EU ,f (t) will be called a t-lemniscate, or just a lemniscate of f .\nGiven a lemniscate domain (U, f, I) we define the corresponding length\nfunction\n|EU ,f (t)| := length(EU ,f (t)), t \u2208 I,\n(3)\nwhich will be in focus of the present paper. On the other hand, the expressions for the higher derivatives of |EU ,f (t)| (see (22) below) involve integrals\nof the kind\nZ\n2\n|w(z)|2 |dz|,\n(4)\nLw (t) = kwkt :=\nEU,f (t)\n\nwhere w(z) is an analytic in U function. This makes it natural to consider\nthe averages (4) as a suitable generalization of the length function. The case\nw \u2261 1 obviously reduces to the length function.\nFurther, we consider the following first-order differential operator\nGf (w) = w[1] := 2gw\u2032 + g \u2032 w,\n\nw[k] = Gkf (w),\n\n(5)\n\n\f4\n\nKuznetsova O.S. and Tkachev V.G.\n\nwhere g = f /f \u2032 , and w[k] are the Gf -iterations of w \u2261 w[0] .\nThe following theorem summarizes the results given in Section 2.2 below.\nTheorem 1. Let (U, f, I) be a regular lemniscate region and w(z) be an\nanalytic in U function. Then Lw (t) \u2208 C \u221e (I). Moreover, for any t \u2208 I the\n(k)\nsequence of derivatives Lw (t), k \u2265 0, t \u2208 I, forms a Hamburger moment\nsequence; that is, for any t \u2208 I and for all p = 0, 1, . . ., the Hankel matrices\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n(p)\nLw (t) L\u2032w (t) . . .

Moreover, the entries of the latter matrix are the\nfollowing scalar products\nZ\n(k)\n0 \u2264 j \u2264 k (7)\nRe w [k\u2212j] w[j] |dz|,\nLw (t) = hw[j] ; w[k\u2212j] it :=\nEU,f (t)\n\nwhere the integrals are independent of the choice of j.\nNow, applying the well-known Bernstein's theorem [5] (see, also [30,\nCh. VI]), we obtain a bilateral Laplace representation of Lw\nCorollary 1. Let (U, f, I) be a regular lemniscate region. Given an analytic\nin U function w(z) there exists a non-decreasing function \u03c3(x) such that\nLw (t) =\n\nZ\n\nEU,f (t)\n\n+\u221e\nZ\n|w(z)| |dz| =\next d\u03c3(x),\n2\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nt \u2208 (\u03b1; \u03b2),\n\n(8)\n\nand the latter integral converges for t \u2208 I.\nFunctions L(t) which satisfy a bilateral Laplace representation (8) are\nknown as exponentially convex functions ([5], [1, \u00a7 V.5.4]). This means that\nthe associated with L(t) stationary kernel L(x, y) = L( x+y\n2 ) is of positive\nm\ntype, i.e. for every finite sequence {tj }1 from I the quadratic form\n\u0012\n\u0013\nm\nX\nti + tj\nL\n\u03bei \u03bej\n2\ni,j=1\nis positive (definite or semidefinite). In particular, given an exponentially\nconvex function L(t) the function ln L(t) is convex.\nThis class was introduced and extensively studied by S. Bernstein [5]\nand D. Widder [30] in connection with the so-called completely (or absolutely) monotonic analytic functions (see the definition in Section 3.2). We\n\n\fLength functions of lemniscates\n\n5\n\nonly mention a deep penetration of the both classes into complex analysis, inequalities analysis [2], special functions [25], probability theory [19],\nradial-function interpolation [29], harmonic analysis on semigroups [3] (for\nfurther discussion and references, see recent survey [4]).\nWe also remark that exponential convexity leads to further inequalities\non Lw and its derivatives like those considered in [16].\nAs another consequence of exponential convexity (see [5, \u00a7 15]) we point\nout the following continuation property, actually, a complexification of the\nlength function (see also (53) below)\nCorollary 2. Under the hypotheses of Theorem 1, the function Lw (t) admits an analytic continuation Lw (z) into the strip a < Re z < b, where\nI = (a, b).\nIn the remaining part of this section we consider the case when the\nfunction f (z) is a monic polynomial P (z) and w(z) \u2261 1. By T1 < . . . <\nT\u03bd\u22121 we denote the set of all (finite) critical values of ln |P |. The intervals\nIj = (Tj\u22121 , Tj ) will be called regular (with respect to P ), where T0 = \u2212\u221e,\nT\u03bd = +\u221e. Then (UP (Ij ), P, Ij ), 1 \u2264 j \u2264 \u03bd \u2212 1, constitutes a special class\nof the principal regular lemniscate regions.\nWe have in the preceding notations\nCorollary 3. Given a regular interval Ij = (Tj\u22121 , Tj ), 1 \u2264 j \u2264 \u03bd, the\nfollowing representation holds\n+\u221e\nZ\n|EP (t)| =\next d\u03c3 P,Ij (x),\n\nt \u2208 Ij ,\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n(9)\n\nwhere \u03c3 P,Ij (x) is a non-decreasing function. In particular, ln |EP (t)| is a\nconvex function on Ij .\nIt turns out (see Section 3.2 below) that the function \u03c3 P,I\u03bd (x) (i.e.,\nj = \u03bd) is a piece-wise constant function and the integral in (9) can be\nwritten as sum of a certain exponential series.\nGiven a monic polynomial P , deg P = n, we define an auxiliary function\n\u03a6P (t) := ln |EP (t)| \u2212\n\nt\n.\nn\n\nWe call \u03a6P (t) the indicator of P . Then \u03a6P (t) has a simple invariance property with respect to dilatations of P\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b1\n\nP\u03b1 (z) := e\u2212\u03b1 P (ze n ) = z n +a1 e\u2212 n z n\u22121 +. . .+an\u22121 e\u2212\n\n\u03b1(n\u22121)\nn\n\nz+an e\u2212\u03b1 (10)\n\n\f6\n\nKuznetsova O.S. and Tkachev V.G.\n\nwhere \u03b1 \u2208 (\u2212\u221e; +\u221e]. Indeed, we note that P\u03b1 (z) is also a monic polynomial, P0 (z) \u2261 P (z), and\n\u03b1\n\nEP\u03b1 (\u03b2) = e\u2212 n EP (\u03b1 + \u03b2).\n\n(11)\n\n\u03a6P\u03b1 (\u03b2) = \u03a6P (\u03b1 + \u03b2).\n\n(12)\n\nHence, we have\nProposition 1. Let P \u2217 (z) be an extremal (with respect to Erd\u00f6s conjecture)\npolynomial of degree n; then t = 0 is an absolute maximum point of \u03a6P \u2217 (t).\nProof. It follows from (12) that\n\u03a6P \u2217 (t) = \u03a6Pt\u2217 (0) = |EPt\u2217 (0)| \u2264 |EP \u2217 (0)| = \u03a6P \u2217 (0)\nwhich proves the required property. \u2293\n\u2294\nTheorem 2. \u03a6P (t) and |EP (t)| are continuous functions in (\u2212\u221e; +\u221e).\nMoreover, if the polynomial P (z) is non-trivial (i.e. is different from (z \u2212\na)n ) then\nA) \u03a6P (t) and |EP (t)| are strictly convex in each regular interval (Tj\u22121 , Tj ),\n1 \u2264 j \u2264 \u03bd;\nB) the following asymptotics behavior holds\nlim \u03a6P (t) = ln 2\u03c0.\n\nt\u2192+\u221e\n\n(13)\n\nRemark 1. A direct analysis near critical points of ln |P | implies that \u03a6P (t)\nis only of H\u00f6lder class there which makes useless the standard variational\nmethods near the corresponding extremum.\nAs another consequences of Theorem 2 we mention the estimate (2) due\nto Pommerenke.\nCorollary 4. Let P be a monic K-polynomial, i.e. the lemniscate EP (0) is\nconnected. Then\n|EP (0)| \u2265 2\u03c0,\nwith equality only in the case P (z) = (z \u2212 a)n .\nProof. We can assume that P (z) 6= (z \u2212 a)n , otherwise |EP (0)| = 2\u03c0. Then\nit easily follows from the definition of K-polynomial that Tk \u2264 0 for all\nk \u2264 \u03bd. Hence, by virtue of Theorem 2 we conclude that \u03a6P (t) is strictly\nconvex in [0; +\u221e). Moreover, by (13) the function \u03a6P (t) is bounded on\n[0; +\u221e) and it follows from the strict convexity of \u03a6P (t) that it is actually\nstrictly decreasing. Because of \u03a6P (0) = ln |EP (0)|, we have \u03a6P (0) > ln 2\u03c0,\nor |EP (0)| > 2\u03c0, which completes the proof. \u2293\n\u2294\n\n\fLength functions of lemniscates\n\n7\n\nBy the Eremenko-Hayman theorem, we know that for all integers n \u2265 2\nan extremal polynomial P \u2217 , deg P = n, does exist such that Z(P \u2217 \u2032 ) \u2282\nEP (0). The following assertion gives a complement to the latter property.\nCorollary 5. If P \u2217 (z) is an extremal polynomial of degree n then the lemniscate EP \u2217 (0) is singular, i.e. it contains at least one critical point:\nZ(P \u2217 \u2032 ) \u2229 EP \u2217 (0) 6= \u2205.\nProof. By Proposition 1, t = 0 is an absolute maximum of the indicator\nfunction \u03a6P \u2217 (t) and it follows that t = 0 can not be a regular value of\nln |P (z)| for \u03a6P \u2217 (t) is strictly convex in a neighborhood of regular values.\n\u2294\n\u2293\nAs another application of (7), in Section 3.1 we obtain explicit formulae\nfor the length functions in the case when f is a solution of the following\nequation\n\u03c6\u2032 = C(1 \u2212 \u03c6\u03bd )\n\nk+1\n\u03bd\n\n.\n\n2. Proof of the main results\n2.1. Preliminaries\nHere we prove the main technical result which we formulate in a form suitable for further applications.\nLet M be a p-dimensional Riemannian manifold and by hX; Y i and \u2207\nthe intrinsic scalar product and covariant derivative are denoted. By div X\nwe denote the divergence of a vector field X generated by \u2207. We recall,\nthat a function u(x) : M \u2192 R is called harmonic if \u2206u \u2261 div \u2207u(x) = 0;\nby \u03a3u (t) we denote the level set {x \u2208 M : u(x) = t}.\nDefinition 2. A triple (U, u, I), where U is an open subset, U \u2282 M , u(x) is\na harmonic function in U, and I = (\u03b1; \u03b2), is said to be a (regular) lemniscate\nregion if for all t \u2208 I the set \u03a3U ,u (t) := \u03a3u (t) \u2229 U is compactly contained\nin U and U is free of critical points of u.\nRemark 2. Clearly, when M = C the preceding definition is reduces to the\nthat one given in Section 1.1. We will not distinguish the corresponding notations (U, f, I) and (U, ln |f |, I), when f is an analytic function; moreover,\nin this case\nEf (t) = \u03a3ln |f | (t),\n\nEU ,f (t) = \u03a3U ,ln |f | (t).\n\n\f8\n\nKuznetsova O.S. and Tkachev V.G.\n\nLemma 1.

Because of regularity condition all the level sets \u03a3U ,u (t) are embedded submanifolds in M and the vector field\n\u03bd(x) \u2261\n\n\u2207u(x)\n|\u2207u(x)|\n\n(17)\n\nrepresents the field of unit normals to \u03a3U ,u (t) pointing in the growth direction of u,\nh\u03bd(x); \u2207u(x)i = |\u2207u(x)|.\n(18)\nWe claim that for any C 1 -vector field v on U\nZ\nZ\ndiv v\nd\nhv; \u03bdi dHp\u22121 =\ndHp\u22121 .\nd\u03c4\n|\u2207u|\n\n(19)\n\n\u03a3U,u (\u03c4 )\n\n\u03a3U,u (\u03c4 )\n\nIndeed, let t \u2208 I, t 6= \u03c4 , be chosen arbitrary. Then by virtue of (18) and\nharmonicity of u(x) we have by Stokes' formula\nZ\nhv; \u03bdi dHp\u22121 =\nF (t) \u2212 F (\u03c4 ) =\nU (t)\u2212U (\u03c4 )\n\n=\n\nZ\n\nhv; \u03bdi dHp\u22121 =\n\nZ\n\n(20)\n\ndiv v dx,\n\nU (t)\u2212U (\u03c4 )\n\n\u2202U (\u03c4,t)\n\nwhere U(t) = {x \u2208 U : u(x) < t} and F (\u03c4 ) denotes the left-hand side\nintegral in (19).\nThen applying co-area formula to (20) we obtain\nF (t) \u2212 F (\u03c4 )\n1\n=\nt\u2212\u03c4\nt\u2212\u03c4\n\nZt\n\u03c4\n\nd\u03be\n\nZ\n\n\u03a3U,u (\u03be)\n\ndiv v\ndHp\u22121 .\n|\u2207u|\n\n(21)\n\n\fLength functions of lemniscates\n\n9\n\nThe latter limit does exist for every regular value \u03c4 of u(x) (even if u is\nonly locally Lipschitz in D [15, \u00a7 3.2]) and (19) follows.\nThus, applying (19) to v = h\u2207u we obtain (15). Moreover, it follows\nfrom (17) that (15) can be written in the form\nZ\nh\u2207h; \u03bdi dHp\u22121\nH \u2032 (\u03c4 ) =\n\u03a3U,u (\u03c4 )\n\nand, again applying (19) to the last relation, now with v = \u2207h(x) we arrive\nat\nZ\ndiv \u2207h\nH \u2032\u2032 (\u03c4 ) =\ndHp\u22121\n|\u2207u|\n\u03a3U,u (\u03c4 )\n\nand the lemma is proved. \u2293\n\u2294\nRemark 3. We notice that in the case when M is a minimal submanifold\nof RN and u(x) is a coordinate function on M , the definition of a regular\nlemniscate region corresponds to a special class of minimal surfaces, socalled minimal tubes, in Euclidean space [23], [24]. In that case a result\nsimilar to Lemma 1 (actually, for the radial symmetric functions h) was\nobtained by V. Klyachin in [20].\nThe following assertion is an easy consequence of Cauchy's inequality\nand the last theorem, and it can be regarded as a particular case of Theorem 1 for p = 1.\nCorollary 6. Let \u2206 ln h \u2265 0; then, under the hypotheses of Lemma 1, the\nfunction ln H(t) is convex in I.\n2.2. Representations of Lw\nHere and in what follows we use the notations of Section 1.1.\nLemma 2. Let (U, f, I) be a regular lemniscate region and w = w[0] be an\nanalytic function in U.

To apply Lemma 1 (see also Remark 2) we note that in our case\nM = C. Let us identify a complex number z = x + iy with the point\n(x, y) \u2208 R2 so that the gradient of a real-valued function h(x, y) takes the\nform h\u2032x + ih\u2032y . Then by Cauchy-Riemann theorem we have for any analytic\nfunction F (z)\n\u2207 Re F (z) \u2261 (Re F (z))\u2032x + i(Re F (z))\u2032y = F \u2032 (z),\nwhence\n\u2207u(z) = \u2207 Re ln f (z) =\n\n1\nf \u2032 (z)\n:=\n.\nf (z)\ng(z)\n\n(23)\n\n(24)\n\nHere and in the sequel we use the logarithms only for brevity of the computations of gradients and, of course, one can deduce these formulae directly.\nHenceforth, we chose the main branch of logarithm, ln 1 = 0.\nMoreover, we point out that g(z), being defined by (24), is an analytic\nfunction in U because of the regularity condition: f \u2032 (z) 6= 0. As a consequence, the same property is obviously true for the iterates w[k] , k \u2265 0.\nNow, let t \u2208 I.

Since the integral\nin L\u2032\u2032w (t) takes the form (4), it is clear now that formulae (22) can be obtained\nby induction from (28) and (29), and the lemma follows. \u2293\n\u2294\nThe further properties of kwk2t can be deduced by using the following\nformalism. Let (U, f, I) be a regular lemniscate region. We endow the space\nof all analytic in U functions by a family of the following scalar products\nZ\nRe u(z)v(z) |dz|\nhu; vit :=\nEt,U (f )\n\nand kwk2t := hw; wit .

Let (U, f, I) be a regular lemniscate region and w = w[0] be\nan analytic function in U. Then for all n \u2265 0\nDn kw[0] k2t = hw[j] ; w[n\u2212j] it ,\n\n\u2200j : 0 \u2264 j \u2264 n,\n\nt \u2208 I,\n\n(33)\n\nwhere w[k] = Gkf (w).\nProof. First we note that by (30)-(31) it is enough to prove that the scalar\nproduct in (33) is independent of j. First, applying k = 0 to (31), we obtain\nDhw[0] ; w[0] it = hw[0] ; w[1] it\n\n(34)\n\nwhich coincides with (33) for n = 1, j = 0, 1.\nNext, applying 2D to both sides of (34) we find by (32) that\n2D2 hw[0] ; w[0] i = 2Dhw[0] ; w[1] it = hw[1] ; w[1] it + hw[0] ; w[2] it ,\n\n(35)\n\nhence taking into account (30), k = 1, we obtain\nhw[1] ; w[1] it = hw[0] ; w[2] it .\nThe last identity shows that (33) is fulfilled for n = 2 and 0 \u2264 j \u2264 2.\nAt the remaining part of the proof we apply induction over index n.\nNamely, we suppose that the statement of our assertion holds for some\nn = m \u2265 2. Then applying (33) for n = m \u2212 1 we obtain for u[0] := w[1]\nDm\u22121 D2 kw[0] k2t = Dm\u22121 kw[1] k2t = Dm\u22121 ku[0] k2t =\n\n= hu[0] ; u[m\u22121] it = hu[i] ; u[m\u2212i\u22121] it ,\n\nfor all 0 \u2264 i \u2264 m \u2212 1. Thus, returning to w[0] we get\nDm+1 kw[0] k2t = hw[1] ; w[m] it = hw[2] ; w[m\u22121] it = hw[i+1] ; w[m\u2212i] it\nfor the same range of i. This proves (33) for n = m + 1 and 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m.\nOn the other hand, applying again the induction assumption n = m to\n(33) we can write\nhw[0] ; w[m] it = hw[1] ; w[m\u22121] it\nhence applying 2D to both sides of the last relation we arrive at\nhw[1] ; w[m] it + hw[0] ; w[m+1] it = hw[2] ; w[m\u22121] it + hw[1] ; w[m] it ,\nor hw[0] ; w[m+1] it = hw[2] ; w[m\u22121] it , which yields (33) for the remaining cases\nj = 0 and j = m + 1. The corollary is proved completely. \u2293\n\u2294\nWe recall the following well-known definition (see, e.g., [1, Ch. 2]).\n\n\fLength functions of lemniscates\n\n13\n\nDefinition 3.

If all the last\nforms are strictly positive the sequence (sk ) is called a strictly positive\nsequence.\nWe recall also the following well-known result of H. Hamburger [17] (see\nalso [30, p. 129]).\nHamburger Theorem. A necessary and sufficient condition that there exist at least one non-decreasing function \u03c3(x) such that\n+\u221e\nZ\nxk d\u03c3(x) = sk ,\n\n(k = 0, 1, . . .)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nwith all the integrals converging, is that the sequence (sk ) should be positive.\nNow Theorem 1 follows from the property formulated below.\nCorollary 8. Let (U, f, I) be a regular lemniscate region and w be an analytic function in U. Then for all t \u2208 I the sequence\nk\n2\nL(k)\nw (t) = D kwkt ,\n\nk = 0, 1, . . .\n(k)\n\nforms a positive sequence. Moreover, (Lw (t))k\u22650 forms a strictly positive\nsequence (for all t \u2208 I) if and only if the system of iterates {w[k] }k\u22650 is\nlinearly independent.\nProof. It follows from (33) that the corresponding Hankel matrices (6) have\n(k)\nthe form of Gram matrices. Hence, (Lw (t))k\u22650 is a positive sequence by\ncharacteristic property of Gram matrices. The latter assertion of the corol(k)\nlary now can be proved as follows. Let the sequence Lw (t0 ) fails strict\npositivity at some t0 \u2208 I; it means that there exists an index N \u2265 0 and a\nvector \u03be \u2208 RN +1 , \u03be 6= 0, such that\n0=\n\nN\nX\n\ni,j=0\n\nL(i+j)\n(t0 )\u03bei \u03bej\nw\n\n=\n\nN\nX\n\ni,j=0\n\nhw[i] ; w[j] it0 \u03bei \u03bej =\n\nN\nX\ni=0\n\n2\n\n.\n\nw[i] \u03bei\nt0\n\n\f14\n\nKuznetsova O.S. and Tkachev V.G.\n\nBut the uniqueness theorem for analytic functions now yields that\nN\nX\ni=0\n\nw[i] \u03bei \u2261 0\n\non U, that is the system {w[i] }N\ni=0 is linearly dependent. In particular, it\n(k)\n\nfollows that Lw (t) fails strict positivity for all t \u2208 I.\nThe converse property is verified in the same manner and the assertion\nis proved. \u2293\n\u2294\n2.3.

In our previous notations\nLw (t) = |EP (t)| = kwk2t\nSince \u03a6P (t) = ln |EP (t)| \u2212 nt , we can examine only the latter logarithm.\nThen convexity of ln |EP (t)| immediately follows from (22) and Cauchy's\ninequality:\n2\n2\n2\nL\u2032\u2032w (t)Lw (t) \u2212 L\u20322\nw (t) = kw[1] kt kwkt \u2212 hw; w[1] it \u2265 0,\n\nt \u2208 Ij .\n\nLet now suppose that for some \u03c4 \u2208 Ij the equality L\u2032\u2032w (\u03c4 )Lw (\u03c4 )\u2212 L\u20322\nw (\u03c4 ) = 0\nholds. Then w[1] (z) = cw(z), z \u2208 EP (\u03c4 ), for a constant c \u2208 R. Then the\nuniqueness theorem for analytic functions yields that the last identity holds\neverywhere in U(Ij ) and it follows from (5) that\n2gw\u2032 + g \u2032 w = cw\nand applying w \u2261 1, we get\nc = g \u2032 (z) \u2261\n\n\u0012\n\nP (z)\nP \u2032 (z)\n\n\u0013\u2032\n\n.\n\nBut this yields P (z) = c(z \u2212 a)P \u2032 (z), and, consequently (since P is a monic\npolynomial), P (z) = (z \u2212 a)n with c = 1/n. Thus, P must be a trivial\npolynomial and the first statement of the theorem is proved.\nContinuity of |Et (P )| can be established as follows. We observe that by\nvirtue of (11) the following relation holds\nt\n\n|EP (t)| = e n |EPt (0)|\n\n(36)\n\nfor all t \u2208 (\u2212\u221e; +\u221e]. On the other hand, we can apply a result of EremenkoHayman [14, Lemma 4] which states that the lemniscate length |EP (0)| is a\ncontinuous function of the coefficients of P . Since the coefficients of Pt (see\n\n\fLength functions of lemniscates\n\n15\n\nthe explicit expression in (10)) are continuous functions of t \u2208 (\u2212\u221e; +\u221e],\nthe required property follows now from (36).\nIt remains to prove (13). Here we have t \u2208 (T\u03bd\u22121 ; +\u221e) where T\u03bd\u22121 is the\nlargest finite critical value of ln |P |. Again, applying the Eremenko-Hayman\nlemma and (11) we notice that limt\u2192+\u221e Pt (z) = z n whence\nlim |Et (P )|e\u2212t/n = |E0 (z n )| = 2\u03c0.\n\nt\u2192+\u221e\n\nand the theorem is proved. \u2293\n\u2294\n3. Applications\n3.1. D-functions\nSome problems being initially posed by Piranian in [26] and dealing with\nmonotonicity and convexity of the length function for Qn (z) = z n \u2212 1 were\nstudied in papers [7], [9]. Below we obtain explicit formulae for the lengthfunctions |Ef (t)| for a special class analytic functions f which include Qn as\na partial case. Our method involves representation (7) to reduce the problem\nto a certain hypergeometric differential equation. We demonstrate it by the\nfollowing example.\nLet w be an analytic function which satisfies the relation\n(\u03b1w + \u03b2w[1] )f \u03bd = \u03b3w + \u03b4w[1] ,\n\n(37)\n\nHere we write as above w[1] = Gf (w) = 2gw\u2032 + g \u2032 w. We exclude the trivial\ncase by assuming that\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b1\u03b2\ndet\n6= 0.\n(38)\n\u03b3 \u03b4\nLet (U, f, I) be a regular lemniscate region. To ensure existence we can\nsuppose that Z(f ) 6= \u2205. Then for all t \u2208 I we have from (37)\ne2\u03bdt |\u03b1w(z) + \u03b2w[1] (z)|2 = |\u03b3w(z) + \u03b4w[1] (z)|2\nthat after integration over EU ,f (t) and using (22) yields\n(\u03b2 2 e2\u03bdt \u2212 \u03b4 2 )L\u2032\u2032w (t) + 2(\u03b1\u03b2e2\u03bdt \u2212 \u03b3\u03b4)L\u2032w (t) + (\u03b12 e2\u03bdt \u2212 \u03b3 2 )Lw (t) = 0 (39)\nwith Lw (t) := kwk2t .\nLet now choose w \u2261 1, such that Lw (t) = |EU ,f (t)| becomes the length\nfunction. Then (37) can be rewritten as\nf\u03bd =\n\n\u03b3 + \u03b4g \u2032 (z)\n.\n\u03b1 + \u03b2g \u2032 (z)\n\n\f16\n\nKuznetsova O.S. and Tkachev V.G.\n\nLet z1 \u2208 Z(f ). We can assume also that z1 is a simple zero of f (z), since\nthe arguments similar to that given below show that the general case also\nleads us to the same form of the main equation (40). Then it follows from\nthe definition of g that g \u2032 (z1 ) = 1 and consequently we have from (37):\n\u03b3 + \u03b4 = 0, whence \u03b3 = \u2212\u03b4. Moreover, it follows from (38) that \u03b4 6= 0 and\nchanging the notations a = \u03b1/\u03b4 and b = \u03b2/\u03b4 we arrive at\ng \u2032 (z) =\nTaking into account that\nd(ln(f /f \u2032 )) =\n\naf \u03bd + 1\n.\n1 \u2212 bf \u03bd\n\ndg\naf \u03bd + 1 df\naf \u03bd + 1 df \u03bd\n*\n*\n=\n=\ng\n1 \u2212 bf \u03bd f\n1 \u2212 bf \u03bd \u03bdf \u03bd\n\nwe obtain after integration and a suitable changing the variables \u03c6(z) =\nc1 f (c2 z) that\nk+1\n(40)\n\u03c6\u2032 = C(1 \u2212 \u03c6\u03bd ) \u03bd ,\n\nwith k = a/b.\nTo analyze the last equation we suppose that \u03bd is a positive integer\nand k + 1 \u2264 \u03bd. Then the set of solutions to (40) is still large and such\nelementary functions as tanh z, sin z, z n \u2212 1, e\u2212z + 1 satisfy these conditions\n(see Table 1).\nk+1\n2\u03bd\n\nk\n\n\u03bd\n\np=\n\n\u2212 n1\n\n1\n\nn\u22121\n2n\n\n\u2212n\n\nsin z\n\n0\n\n2\n\n1\n4\n\n1\n\ntanh z\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n\ne\u2212z + 1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n\n\u03c6(z)\n1 \u2212 zn\n\nC\n\nTable 1. Elementary D-functions\n\nFirst, we notice that under our assumptions the integral\nZ z\nd\u03b6\nF (z) =\nk+1 ,\n0 (1 \u2212 \u03b6 \u03bd ) \u03bd\n\nwhere the principal branch of the root is chosen, defines a univalent function\nF (z) in the unit disk D = {z : |z| < 1} since the real part of the derivative\n\u2032\n\nRe F (z) =\n\nRe(1 \u2212 z \u03bd )\n|1 \u2212 z \u03bd |\n\nk+1\n\u03bd\n\n2(k+1)\n\u03bd\n\n> 0,\n\nz\u2208D\n\n\fLength functions of lemniscates\n\n17\n\nis positive and we can apply the Noshiro-Warschawski theorem [8, p. 47].\nThus, for any C 6= 0 the function \u03c6(z) given by\nF (\u03c6(z)) = Cz\nis analytic (and univalent) in S := C1 F (D), \u03c6 : S \u2192 D and satisfies (40)\nthere. We call such a function \u03c6 a D-function.\nAn important property of D-functions is that their critical values have\nthe same magnitude: \u03c6\u2032 (\u03b6) = 0 \u21d2 |\u03c6(\u03b6)| = 1. Clearly, (S \u2217 , \u03c6, (\u2212\u221e, 0)) is a\nregular lemniscate region of the function \u03c6, where S \u2217 = S \\ {0}.\nAnother representation of F can be easily found by using the Gauss\nhypergeometric function\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1+k 1 1+\u03bd \u03bd\n\u03b6 \u2208 D.\n, ;\n,\u03b6 ,\nF (\u03b6) = \u03b6 2 F1\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\nTheorem 3. Let \u03bd \u2208 Z+ and k \u2264 \u03bd \u2212 1. Then in the preceding notations,\nthe following formula holds\n|ES \u2217 ,\u03c6 (t)| =\n\n2\u03c0et\n2\u03bdt\n),\n2 F1 (p, p; 1; e\n|C|\n\n(41)\n\nwhere p = (k+1)/2\u03bd and 2 F1 (a, b; c; z) is the Gauss hypergeometric function.\nProof. Let \u03c6(z) a D-function with parameters \u03bd, k, and C. Then\ng\u03c6\u2032 (z) \u2261\n\n1 + k\u03c6\u03bd\n\u03c6(z)\n,\n=\n\u2032\n\u03c6 (z)\n1 \u2212 \u03c6\u03bd\n\nand after comparing with (37) we have \u03b1 = k, \u03b2 = 1, \u03b3 = \u2212\u03b4 = \u22121. We\nnotice that in our previous notations the function |ES \u2217 ,\u03c6 (t)| = Lw (t) is a\nsolution of (39) where w \u2261 1. Hence, letting t = ln \u03c4 and\nL(\u03c4 ) := |ES \u2217 ,\u03c6 (ln \u03c4 )|\none can readily see from (39) that\n\u03c4 2 (\u03c4 2\u03bd \u2212 1)L\u2032\u2032 (\u03c4 ) + [1 + (2k + 1)\u03c4 2\u03bd ]\u03c4 L\u2032 (\u03c4 ) + (k 2 \u03c4 2\u03bd \u2212 1)L(\u03c4 ) = 0. (42)\nFurther, the change of variables x = \u03c4 2\u03bd and L(\u03c4 ) = \u03c4 y(\u03c4 2\u03bd ) reduces\n(42) to the hypergeometric canonic form\n\u00132\n\u0015\n\u0012\n\u0014\nk+1\nk+1\ny(x) = 0.\n(43)\n) y \u2032 (x) \u2212\nx(1 \u2212 x)y \u2032\u2032 (x) + 1 \u2212 x(1 +\n\u03bd\n2\u03bd\nThe general solution to (43) in [0; 1) can be written as follows\ny(\u03c4 ) = 2 F1 (p, p; 1; \u03c4 ) \u03bb +\nwhere \u03bb, \u03bc \u2208 R (see [10, \u00a7 2.3.1]).\n\n2 F1 (p, p; 2p; 1\n\n\u2212 \u03c4 ) \u03bc,\n\n\f18\n\nKuznetsova O.S. and Tkachev V.G.\n\nTaking into account that z = 0 \u2208 S is a simple zero of \u03c6 we conclude\nthat the length function |ES \u2217 ,\u03c6 (t)| = O(et ) as t \u2192 \u2212\u221e. Thus, y(\u03c4 ) is a\nbounded function near \u03c4 = +0. Since\nlim\n\n\u03c4 \u2192+0\n\n2 F1 (p, p; 2p; 1\n\n\u2212 \u03c4) = \u221e\n\n(see [10, \u00a7 2.1.3])) we have \u03bc = 0 and after substitution of the old notations\nwe arrive at\n|ES \u2217 ,\u03c6 (t)| = \u03bbet 2 F1 (p, p; 1; e2\u03bdt ).\nThe precise form of \u03bb can now be found by the asymptotic behavior\n|ES \u2217 ,\u03c6 (t)| =\n\n2\u03c0et\n,\n|\u03c6\u2032 (0)|\n\nt \u2192 \u2212\u221e,\n\nOn the other hand, by the definition of D-function |\u03c6\u2032 (0)| = |C| and the\ntheorem is proved. \u2293\n\u2294\nRemark 4. In the case t > 0, the last theorem is still meaningful provided\nthat the level sets {|\u03c6(z)| = et } are compact or periodic curves (the last,\ne.g., corresponds to \u03c6 = sin z). These cases are treated in [21].\n3.2. The structure of \u03c3 P,I\nHere we describe an explicit structure of the measure function (for monic\npolynomials) \u03c3 P,Ij (x) when j = \u03bd, i.e. the interval (T\u03bd\u22121 , +\u221e) is free of\ncritical values of ln |P |. The latter means that the corresponding lemniscates\nEP (t), t \u2208 I\u03bd , are single-component closed curves.\nTheorem 4.

Let t > T (P ) be chosen arbitrary. Then EP (t) is a simple Jordan\ncurve which is the boundary of a simply-connected domain\nDt = {z \u2208 C : |P (z)| < et }.\nLet Dt\u2217 = C \\ Dt . Then P (z) maps D\u2217 (t) onto Ut := {\u03b6 \u2208 C : |\u03b6| > et }.\nSince P \u2032 (z) 6= 0 in Ut the analytic function F (z) = P 1/n (z), F (z) \u223c z as\nz \u2192 \u221e, is well defined in D\u2217 (t). Moreover, F (z) is univalent in D\u2217 (t) for all\nt \u2265 T (P ). We denote by \u03c6(\u03b6) the inverse function which is also a univalent\nfunction and observe that\n\u03c6 : UT (P )/n \u2192 D\u2217 (T (P ));\n\n\u03c6\u2032 (\u03b6) 6= 0,\n\n\u03b6 \u2208 UT (P )/n .\n\n(46)\n\nWe have \u03c6(\u03b6) \u223c \u03b6 as \u03b6 \u2192 \u221e and letting P (z) = z n + a1 z n\u22121 . . . + an we\nobtain\n(n \u2212 1)a21 \u2212 2na2 1\n\u03c6\u2032 (\u03b6) = 1 \u2212\n+ ...,\n\u03b6 \u2192 \u221e.\n(47)\n2n2\n\u03b62\n\u221a\nIt follows that \u03c6\u2032 \u221a\nis a well-defined analytic function in UT (P )/n (for sake\nof completeness let 1 = 1).

Thus, the right-hand side of (49) is at most |EP (T (P ))| for all\nt > T (P ). Then it follows from positivity of the terms of the corresponding\nseries and the mentioned continuity that (49) is still true for t = T (P ),\nwhich in turn yields (45) and completes the proof. \u2293\n\u2294\n\n\f20\n\nKuznetsova O.S. and Tkachev V.G.\n\nCorollary 9.
