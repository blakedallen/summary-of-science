Bo\u017cek2,1\n1\n\n2\n\nInstitute of Nuclear Physics PAN, Krak\u00f3w, Poland\nInstitute of Physics, Rzesz\u00f3w University, Rzesz\u00f3w, Poland\nJune 28, 2018\nAbstract\n\nWithin the self-consistent Green's functions formalism, we study the effects of three-body\nforces on the in-medium spectral function, self-energy and effective mass of the nuclear matter\nconstituents, analyzing the density and momentum dependence.\n\nAll microscopic calculations based on bare nucleon-nucleon (NN) potentials which aim at a realistic\ndescription of nuclear matter should include three-body forces (TBF). In Ref. [1] within the selfconsistent Green's functions formalism we computed macroscopic and microscopic properties of both\nsymmetric and pure neutron matter starting from CD-Bonn [2] and Nijmegen [3] potentials implemented\nwith the Urbana TBF [4]. Three-body forces have been included via an effective two-body interaction\nadded to the NN potential in the in-medium T -matrix, derived by closing an outgoing nucleon line with\nan ingoing one in the three-body diagram in all topologically different ways. The calculation of the\nenergy per particle at T = 0 in symmetric matter confirms the necessity of taking three-body forces into\naccount in order to describe correctly the saturation behavior; the resulting neutron matter equation\nof state and the symmetry energy are in agreement with the current estimations.\nWe briefly discuss the effects of the inclusion of TBF on the single-particle properties. In particular\nwe address the momentum and density dependence of the modifications of the spectral function A(p, \u03c9),\nthe effective mass m\u22c6 (p), which is derived from\n\u2202\u03c9p\n1\n=\n,\n2\n\u2202p\n2m\u22c6\n\nwhere\n\n\u03c9p =\n\np2\n+ Re \u03a3(p, \u03c9p ) ,\n2m\n\n(1)\n\nand the self-energy at the quasiparticle pole Re \u03a3(p, \u03c9p ).\nIn Fig. 1 we present these modifications in the form of the ratio between the quantities computed\nwith and without TBF, for isospin symmetric and pure neutron matter at zero temperature. The results\nare shown for the CD-Bonn potential, and are qualitatively similar when the Nijmegen interaction is\nused. For three different densities the ratios are displayed as a function of the momentum up to and\nabove the Fermi momentum kF . Overall we observe changes of about 20-30 %, the largest at higher\ndensities as expected from the density dependence of the three-body potential.\nThe spectral function is broadened at all densities in symmetric matter, while the opposite effect\nis present in pure neutron matter, with a narrowing of the peak.

X stands for the real self-energy at the quasi-particle pole\nRe \u03a3(p, \u03c9p ) (dashed line), the effective mass m\u22c6 (p) (continuous line) and the value of the\npeak of the spectral function A(p, \u03c9peak ) (crosses).

We notice that in both cases\nthe modification gets stronger in the vicinity of the Fermi surface, signaling a change in the scattering\nbehavior, and decreases in the high momenta region where X 3-body/X 2-body \u2248 1.\nThe self-energy and the effective mass also show a different response depending on the isospin\nasymmetry. In general the real part of the self-energy is decreased (increased) by TBF and the effective\nmass at the Fermi surface is larger (smaller) when TBF are included in symmetric (neutron) matter.\nThe largest modifications appear for intermediate momenta and are suppressed, in both cases, for\nk > kF , with the ratios approaching the value of one.\nThe inclusion of three-body forces does modify the scattering behavior of nucleons in the dense\nmedium. At low and intermediate momenta all single-particle observables are affected. Around kF\nthe single-particle spectrum undergoes the largest changes, then above the Fermi surface the effects\nin general are suppressed. These modifications can be reflected in the estimation of the in-medium\nnucleon-nucleon cross-section, relevant for heavy-ion reactions and the physics of neutron stars.\nAcknowledgments Research supported in part by the Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education, grant No. N202 1022 33.\n\nReferences\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n\nV.
