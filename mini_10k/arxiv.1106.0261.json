We investigate the metric aspect of such quantum spaces, comparing two notions\nof distance and length, that appeared at various points in the literature.\nThe first one has been introduced by several authors in [1] and [4], and consists in\ndefining a length operator\nv\nu d\nX\n. u\nL = t (dq\u03bc )2 ,\n(1.2)\n\u03bc=1\n\nusing the universal differential of the coordinate operators q\u03bc 's,\n.\ndq\u03bc = q\u03bc \u2297 I \u2212 I \u2297 q\u03bc ,\n\n(1.3)\n\nacting on H \u2297 H, with I the identity in B(H). Viewing a pair of states \u03c6, \u03c6\u0303 on A (that\nis: positive, normalized, linear maps from A to C) as a single two-\"quantum points\" state\n\u03c6 \u2297 \u03c6\u0303 (this notion will be made more precise in section III.3), we define the associated\nquantum length as\ndL (\u03c6, \u03c6\u0303) = (\u03c6 \u2297 \u03c6\u0303)(L).\n(1.4)\nThe second notion is Connes' spectral distance [13] between states of an involutive\nalgebra A . It is defined as\n.\ndD (\u03c6, \u03c6\u0303) = sup{|\u03c6(a) \u2212 \u03c6\u0303(a)|, k[D, \u03c0(a)]k \u2264 1},\n\n(1.5)\n\na\u2208A\n\nwhere \u03c0 denotes a representation of A on some Hilbert space \u0124 and D is a selfadjoint\noperator generalizing the Dirac operator \u2202/ = \u2212i\u03b3 \u03bc \u2202\u03bc of quantum field theory. The set\n(A, \u0124, D) is called a spectral triple. We shall not enter into the details of the theory here,\ninviting the interested reader to see, for instance, the recent survey [9] as well as [5] for a\npanorama of noncommutative geometry in physics.\nIn the commutative (flat) case, these two notions of length and distance match, as\nrecalled in section II. Specifically, on the Euclidean space Rd , the coordinate operators\nq\u03bc 's act as multiplicative operators on H = L2 (Rd ), and so does the commutative algebra\n2\n\n\fI\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nA = C0\u221e (Rd ) on \u0124 = H. Then, the restrictions to pure states of both the spectral distance\n(1.5) and the quantum length (1.4) coincide with the Euclidean distance. Notice that the\nflatness requirement stems from the use of the universal differential of the coordinates in\nthe definition (1.2) of the length operator (see remark II.3).\nIn the noncommutative case, a major difference appears: while dD is still a distance in\nthe mathematical sense (although, strictly speaking, we should call it a pseudo-distance\nsince it might be infinite), the quantum length dL is no longer a distance, for there exists\nstates at non-zero quantum length from themselves. This happens, for instance, to the\nground state \u03c90 of the quantum harmonic oscillator in the quantum spacetime model of\nDoplicher, Fredenhagen and Roberts (DFR) [4, 23], as well as in the canonical noncommutative space \u03b8-Minkowski [1]. One finds\ndL (\u03c90 , \u03c90 ) = lP\n\n(1.6)\n\n\u221a\nwhere lP = 2\u03bbP is the minimum of the spectrum of the length operator L.\nThis paper aims at resolving the discrepancy between the quantum length and the\nspectral distance in the noncommutative case, by using a natural tool in noncommutative\ngeometry consisting in doubling the spectral triple. In a word, one implements the nonzero minimal length lP within the spectral distance framework by substituting - into the\nspectral triple - A with A \u2297 C2 . Applied to the spectral triple of the Moyal plane, this\nprocedure allows to identify the quantum length dL (\u03c90 , \u03c90 ) in (1.6) with the spectral\ndistance dD0 (\u03c901 , \u03c902 ) in a two-sheet model, each of the two copies \u03c90i of \u03c90 living on a\ndifferent sheet. Here, the expression \"two-sheet model\" refers to the space of pure states\nof A \u2297 C2 being the disjoint union of two copies of the pure state space of A, indexed\nby the two pure states of C2 . More exactly, we show in proposition IV.5 the equivalence\nof the following two points of view: identifying the quantum length dL with the spectral\ndistance dD0 in a double Moyal space amounts to identifying the spectral distance dD on\na single Moyal space with a new quantity d0L induced by the length operator, that we call\nthe modified quantum length. We show these identifications actually hold true:\n- exactly on the set of coherent states of the quantum harmonic oscillator, which are\nstates of optimal localization from the DFR point of view (corollary IV.6);\n- asymptotically on a larger class of generalized coherent states, consisting in the\neigenstates of the harmonic oscillator together with all their translations (proposition\nIV.8).\nWe interpret the discrepancy between dD and d0L at small scale as two distinct ways of\nintegrating the line element on a quantum space. This leads us to propose an equation\nfor geodesics on the Moyal plane (proposition V.2).\nThe paper is organised as follows. In section II, we discuss the commutative case Rd\nand show that the spectral distance and the quantum length both coincide with the Euclidean distance. We list several questions that one has to face when dealing with the\nnoncommutative case, in particular regarding the emergence of a minimal length lP , and\nindicate how to adress this problem by doubling the spectral triple. In section III, we\ndiscuss the various models of quantum spacetimes on which the definition (1.1) of quantum length makes sense, namely the DFR model and \u03b8-Minkowski. We show that for our\npurposes they are both equivalent to the Moyal plane. Hence the possibility to compare\nthe quantum length with the spectral distance, using the spectral triple of the Moyal\nplane proposed in [24] and whose metric properties have been studied in [7] and [29]. This\ncomparison is the object of section IV. Known results about the quantum length and the\nspectral distance are recalled and extended: one the one side, the spectrum of the length\n3\n\n\fII\n\nMINIMAL LENGTH BY SPECTRAL DOUBLING\n\noperator L is studied in detail, including the degeneracy of the ground state. On the\nother side, we stress that the spectral distance dD on the Moyal plane can take all value\nin [0, \u221e] as soon as one takes into account sufficiently many states. We then apply the\ndoubling procedure, and show that the relevant object - built from the length operator\nL - with whom the comparison of the spectral distance dD on the Moyal plane makes\nsense is not the quantum length, but the modified quantum length d0L . We compare d0L to\ndD on various classes of states, including eigenstates and coherent states of the harmonic\noscillator. Section V deals with the low energy discrepancy between d0L and dD , and its\ninterpretation in terms of integration of the line element.\nNotations: S(A) denotes the space of states of A, with generic element \u03c6. The set of its\nextremal points, that is the pure state space, is denoted P(A), with generic element \u03c9.\nB(H) is the algebra of bounded operators on a Hilbert space H, K the algebra of\ncompact operators. S(Rd ) is the space of Schwartz functions on Rd .\n.\n\u03c9\u03c8 denotes the vector state \u03c9\u03c8 = h\u03c8, *\u03c8i associated to \u03c8 \u2208 H. For \u03c8 = |mi the\nnth eigenvector of the Hamiltonian H of the harmonic oscillator, we use the shorthand\nnotation \u03c9|mi = \u03c9m .\nAll along the paper, dD , d\u2202/ , dDI , dD0 denote Connes' spectral distance associated to\nthe Dirac operators D, \u2202/, DI , D0 . They should not be confused with dL , dL2 , d0L that\ndenote various quantities associated to the length operator L, defined in the core of the\ntext.\n.\nGiven a symplectic form \u03c3 on R2N , we denote S the matrix with entries \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd =\n\u03c3(x\u03bc , x\u03bd ). Einstein summation is used on alternate indices (up/down).\nII\n\nMinimal length by spectral doubling\n\nThe notions of point, path between points - and a fortiori geodesic distance as the\nlength of the shortest path between them - are ill defined in quantum mechanics. To\nget a notion of distance that makes sense in both a classical and a quantum context,\na viable strategy is to work out a definition in term of the algebra of coordinates only,\nregardless of their commutation properties, making sure this definition coincides with the\nusual one when the coordinates do commute. In this section, we begin with checking that\nthe quantum length dL and the spectral distance dD discussed in (1.4) and (1.5) meet this\ncriteria. These are known results, but it is good to have them in mind when discussing\nthe noncommutative case.\nII.1\n\nCommutative case\n\nTo fix the ideas, let us consider the Euclidean space Rd , d \u2208 N, with Cartesian coordinates {x\u03bc }d\u03bc=1 . By Gelfand theorem, the pures states of the commutative algebra C0 (Rd )\nof continuous functions vanishing at infinity are evaluations at points x \u2208 Rd ,\n\u2200f \u2208 C0 (Rd ).\n\n\u03c9x (f ) = f (x)\n\n(2.1)\n\nLet \u03c0 denote the representation of C0 (Rd ) on L2 (Rd ) as multiplicative operators,\n.\n(\u03c0(f )\u03c8)(x) = f (x)\u03c8(x)\n\n\u2200\u03c8 \u2208 L2 (Rd ).\n\n(2.2)\n\nLet q\u03bc denote the (unbounded, densely defined) selfadjoint coordinate operators whose\naction on L2 (Rd ) reads\n.\n(q\u03bc \u03c8)(x) = x\u03bc \u03c8(x).\n(2.3)\n4\n\n\fII\n\nMINIMAL LENGTH BY SPECTRAL DOUBLING\n\nNotice that \u03c0(f ) is the mapping of f through the functional calculus of the q\u03bc 's,\nf (q\u03bc ) = \u03c0(f ).\n\n(2.4)\n\nThe q\u03bc 's do not belong to C0 (Rd ) but are affiliatedd to it in the sense of Woronowicz [39].\nThe space being classical is traced back in the vanishing of the commutator [q\u03bc , q\u03bd ].\nAs mentioned in the introduction, the restriction to pure states of the spectral distance\nassociated to the spectral triple (C0 (Rd ), L2 (Rd ), \u2202/) coincides with the Euclidean distance,\nd\u2202/ (\u03c9x , \u03c9y ) = dEucl (x, y)\n\n\u2200x, y \u2208 Rd .\n\n(2.5)\n\nIn fact, a more general result holds.\nProposition II.1 On any locally compact, geodesically complete Riemannian spin manifold M, the spectral distance d\u2202/ coincides with the Wasserstein distance of order 1. On\npure states, d\u2202/ is the geodesic distance.\nProof. The proof that d\u2202/ (\u03c9x , \u03c9y ) = dgeo (x, y) for any x, y \u2208 M can be found e.g. in [15].\nRieffel in [34] seems to have been the first to notice that, for compact manifold, Connes'\ndistance was the dual formulation (Kantorovich duality) of the Wasserstein distance of order 1. The extension to complete, locally compact manifold has been worked out in [17]. \u0004\nThe quantum length (1.4) between pure states is dL (\u03c9x , \u03c9y ) = \u03c9x \u2297 \u03c9y (L), where\nv\nu d\nuX\nL = t (q\u03bc \u2297 I \u2212 I \u2297 q\u03bc )2\n(2.6)\n\u03bc=1\n\nis the length operator defined by the commutative coordinate operator (2.3) and \u03c9x \u2297 \u03c9y\nis extended to C(R2 ) 3 f by \u03c9x \u2297 \u03c9y (f ) = f (x, y).\nProposition II.2 The quantum length dL equals the Euclidean distance: dL (\u03c9x , \u03c9y ) =\ndEucl (x, y) for any pure states \u03c9x , \u03c9y of C0 (Rd ).\nProof. The universal differential dq\u03bc = q\u03bc \u2297I\u2212I\u2297q\u03bc acts on \u03c81 \u2297\u03c82 \u2208 Dom(q\u03bc )\u2297Dom(q\u03bc ) \u2282\nL2 (Rd ) \u2297 L2 (Rd ) by multiplication,\n(dq\u03bc (\u03c81 \u2297 \u03c82 ))(x, y) = (x\u03bc \u2212 y\u03bc ) (\u03c81 \u2297 \u03c82 )(x, y).\n(2.7)\nqP\nd\n2\nThus the operator L, viewed as the image of the function\n\u03bc=1 x\u03bc through the functional calculus of the dq\u03bc 's, acts as multiplication by the Euclidean distance. Hence the\nresult since \u03c9x \u2297 \u03c9y is the evaluation at (x, y) \u2208 R2 .\n\u0004\nNotice that the set of all possible outcomes of a distance measurement between any two\npoints is retrieved as the spectrum of L, here R+ (there is no minimal length in the\nEuclidean space and its diameter is infinite).\nIt is important to underline that the definition of the length operator L heavily relies\non the choice of the coordinate system. The dq\u03bc 's are relevant only if the distance can\nbe written as a function of the difference of the coordinates. This is not the case, for\nAn element T is affiliated to a C \u2217 -algebra A if bounded continuous functions of T belong to the\nmultiplier algebra M (A) of A. In our context the unbounded operator q\u03bc 's are affiliated to C0 (Rd ),\nmeaning that for any bounded function f on Rd , f (q\u03bc ) \u2208 M (C0 (Rd )) = Cb (Rd ) where Cb (Rd ) is the\nalgebra of bounded functions on Rd .\nd\n\n5\n\n\fII\n\nMINIMAL LENGTH BY SPECTRAL DOUBLING\n\ninstance, in the Euclidean space R3 with spherical coordinates (r, \u03b8, \u03c6). Indeed, using\nx1 = r sin \u03b8 cos \u03c6, x2 = r sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6, x3 = r cos \u03b8, one obtains that the Euclidean distance\nbetween two points x, y with the same radial coordinate is\nq\ndEucl (x, y) = r 2 (1 \u2212 cos \u03b8x cos \u03b8y \u2212 cos(\u03c6x \u2212 \u03c6y ) sin \u03b8x sin \u03b8y ).\n(2.8)\nThis means that the universal differential of the spherical coordinate operators\n.\n.\n(\u0398\u03c8)(x) = \u03b8x \u03c8(x), (\u03a6\u03c8)(x) = \u03c6x \u03c8(x)\n\n(2.9)\n\ncannot be used to define a length operator in the Euclidean space. This does not really\nmatter, since for Rd there exists at least one globally defined coordinate system (the\nCartesian one) whose associated distance function does the job. But this matters in\ncurved spacetime. For instance the geodesic distance on the sphere S 2 , say of radius 1, is\ndEucl (x, y)\n.\n(2.10)\n2\nThis is a function of the difference of the Cartesian coordinates, but the latter are not\nintrinsic (they come from the embedding of S 2 in R3 , and are not local coordinates associated to a chart). This is not a function of the difference of the spherical coordinates.\nOf course dS 2 is invariant by rotation but, say on Earth, the only rotation which amounts\nto a translation into spherical coordinates is the one around the Earth axis (a translation\nin longitude is not a rotation: moving two points of the equator on their own meridian,\nkeeping them on the same parallel, makes the distance smaller, up to zero when both\nreach a pole). In order to build a length operator LS 2 on the sphere, one could use the\nfunctional calculus to define\nr\nf (\u0398, \u03a6)\nLS 2 (\u0398, \u03a6) = 2 arcsin\n(2.11)\n2\nwhere\n.\nf (\u0398, \u03a6) = I \u2212 cos(\u0398 \u2297 I) cos(I \u2297 \u0398) \u2212 cos(d\u03a6) sin(I \u2297 \u03a6) sin(\u03a6 \u2297 I).\n(2.12)\ndS 2 (x, y) = 2 arcsin\n\nIn the commutative case, this certainly gives back the distance on S 2 , but in the noncommutative case, depending on the commutation relation imposed between \u0398 and \u03a6, one\nwill face ordering ambiguity. We shall not develop on that here, concluding with a simple\nremark that clearly limits the range of application of the universal differential dq\u03bc 'se .\nRemark II.3 Let M be a Riemannian manifold. Assume there is a chart M \u2283 U 3 x 7\u2192\n{x\u03bc }d\u03bc=1 \u2208 Rd such that, for all x, y \u2208 U ,\ndgeo (x, y) = l(x\u03bc \u2212 y\u03bc )\n\n(2.13)\n\nfor a continuous function l. Then the metric on U is, up to dilation, the Euclidean metric.\nIndeed, (2.13) amounts to asking any constant - in the coordinates system {x\u03bc }- vector\nfield to be Killing. This means that the Lie derivative of the metric tensor in any of the\ncoordinate-directions is zero, that is the components of the metric are constant. Up to a\nunitary transformation, the metric tensor is thus a diagonal constant matrix.\ne\n\nRegarding pseudo-Riemannian geometry, the length operator approach is suitable for the flat case,\ndefining the Minkowski length operator (see [4])\nd\u22121\n.\nLMink = dq02 \u2212 \u03a3 qi2 .\ni=1\n\nThe spectral distance does not make sense in this context. Nevertheless other relevant objects, like the\nLorentzian distance dLor (x, y) on globally hyperbolic manifolds (which equals dgeo (x, y) when y belongs\nto the causal future of x and vanishes otherwise) can be retrieved by a formula similar to the one of the\nspectral distance.[31]\n\n6\n\n\fII\n\nMINIMAL LENGTH BY SPECTRAL DOUBLING\n\nII.2\n\nQuestions for the noncommutative case\n\nIn the light of the preceding section, the spectral distance dD and the quantum length\ndL offer two ways to extract some metric information from a noncommutative space. Both\nways are equally \"natural\", in that they both coincide with the Euclidean distance in the\ncommutative case.\nSeveral questions are raised by the noncommutative case. One is to determine which\nalgebra A in the spectral distance formula (1.5) is relevant for the quantum coordinates\n(1.1). We shall see in section III that for the DFR and \u03b8-Minkowski models, the fact that\nthe Q\u03bc\u03bd 's are central operators and one considered only regular representations leads to\nthe algebra of compact operators K.\nOther questions are independent of the choice of the algebra. They reflect the structural\ndifferences between the quantum length and the spectral distance, that remain hidden in\nthe commutative case but become important in the noncommutative framework.\ni. Separable states: a first question concerns the nature of the quantum objects one is\nhandling. What is the \"quantum curve\" whose length is being measured, between which\n\"quantum points\" is one measuring the distance ? On the one side, the spectral distance\nassociates a number to any pair of states of A, in particular vector states \u03c9\u03c8 , \u03c8 \u2208 \u0124.\nOn the other hand, the quantum length associates a number (\u03c6 \u2297 \u03c6\u0303)(L) to any two-point\n(separablef from now on) state \u03c6 \u2297 \u03c6\u0303. However, there are many ways to construct a twopoint state which is not a simple tensor from a pair of one-point vector state \u03c9\u03c81 , \u03c9\u03c82 :\nnamely, assuming H = \u0124, by considering the vector states \u03c9\u03c6 associated to any linear\ncombination\nX\nX\n\u03c612 =\n\u03bbij \u03c8i \u2297 \u03c8j ,\n|\u03bbij |2 = 1.\n(2.14)\ni,j=1,2\n\ni,j=1,2\n\nSince the length operator L is symmetric in the exchange 1 \u2194 2, one can restrict to\nsymmetric linear combinations without loss of generality. Still, the choice is far from\nunique and we comment about this in the conclusion.\nii. Square root problem: eigenvectors \u03c6 of L have a priori no special meaning for the\nspectral distance, whereas from the quantum length perspective they represent the \"pure\nstates of length\", for which\nq\n\u03c9\u03c6 (L2 ).\n\n\u03c9\u03c6 (L) =\n\n(2.15)\n\nFor general separable states \u03c6\u2297 \u03c6\u0303, the square root no longer commutes with the evaluation\nand one simply has\np\n(\u03c6 \u2297 \u03c6\u0303)(L) \u2264 (\u03c6 \u2297 \u03c6\u0303)(L2 ),\n(2.16)\n.\nthat can be derived noticing that - with b = b\u2217 = L \u2212 \u03c9\u03c8\u2297\u03c8\u0303 (L)I - one has \u22062\u03c6\u2297\u03c6\u0303 (L) =\n\u03c9\u03c6\u2297\u03c6\u0303 (b\u2217 b) \u2265 0. For these states, it might be more convenient to work with the quantum\nsquare-length\n.\ndL2 (\u03c6 \u2297 \u03c6\u0303) = (\u03c6 \u2297 \u03c6\u0303)(L2 ),\n(2.17)\nhaving in mind that\ndL (\u03c6 \u2297 \u03c6\u0303) \u2264\n\np\ndL2 (\u03c6 \u2297 \u03c6\u0303).\n\n(2.18)\n\nNotice that in the Abelian case there is no such problem, for square root and evaluation\ncommute, so that (2.18) is an equality.\nf\nIn the sense of quantum mechanics, that is: a separable two-point state vector is a vector \u03c6 on the\ntwo-point Hilbert space H \u2297 H that can be written as a simple tensor \u03c6 = \u03c8 \u2297 \u03c8\u0303 for some \u03c8, \u03c8\u0303 \u2208 H. In\ncontrast, entangled states \u03c6 = \u03a3\u03bbij \u03c8i \u2297 \u03c8j , \u03bbij \u2208 C, are those state vectors in H \u2297 H that do not factorize\nij\n\nas a simple product. Similarly, we call separable two-point state any states of A \u2297 A that can be written\nas a simple tensor \u03c6 \u2297 \u03c6\u0303.\n\n7\n\n\fII\n\nMINIMAL LENGTH BY SPECTRAL DOUBLING\n\niii. Minimal length vs distance function: our notation clearly indicates that dL ought\nto be seen as a distance on the space of states, that is as positive function of two variables\nx, y, symmetric in the exchange of its arguments, which vanishes if and only if x = y\nand satisfies the triangle inequality. As stressed in the introduction, dL cannot be a\ndistance because of the non-vanishing of the minimum lP of Sp(L). Another way to see\nthe problem is to notice that, although the valuation of dq\u03bc on a two-point state \u03c6\u2297 \u03c6\u0303 gives\nthe difference of the mean values of the coordinate operators between the two one-point\nstates \u03c6, \u03c6\u0303, namely\n(\u03c6 \u2297 \u03c6\u0303)(dq\u03bc ) = \u03c6(q\u03bc ) \u2212 \u03c6\u0303(q\u03bc );\n(2.19)\nthe quantum length d\u0010L is not\u0011 the Euclidean distance between these mean values. This\nis true when (\u03c6 \u2297 \u03c6\u0303) (dq\u03bc )2 equals ((\u03c6 \u2297 \u03c6\u0303) (dq\u03bc ))2 , that is to say when the standard\ndeviation\n\u22062\u03c6\u2297\u03c6\u0303 (dq\u03bc ) = \u22062\u03c6 (q\u03bc ) + \u22062\u03c6\u0303 (q\u03bc )\n(2.20)\nvanishes. This indeed happens in the commutative case, for pure states are also characters.\nBut in the noncommutative case (2.20) has no reason to vanish. This gives a precise\nmeaning to the notion of \"fuzzy points\", often encountered in the literature, as pure\nstates with non-zero standard deviation.\nII.3\n\nMinimal length by spectral doubling\n\nWe address point iii above, recalling how to implement a minimal length within the\nspectral distance framework, by doubling the spectral triple [13]. For the moment, we shall\nwork with an arbitrary triple, without assuming any link with the quantum coordinates\nq\u03bc 's in (1.1). The application to quantum spaces will be the object of section IV. Our aim\nhere is the following: given a spectral triple T = (A, H, D), and a real positive constant\nlP , what sense can be given to an expression like dD (\u03c9, \u03c9) = lP for \u03c9 \u2208 P(A) ?\nThe product of an (even) spectral triple T = (A, H, D) with the simplest non-trivial\nfinite dimensional spectral triple, namely\n\u0012\n\u0013\n0 \u039b\n.\n2\n2\nAI = C , HI = C , DI =\n,\n(2.21)\n\u039b 0\nwhere \u039b a constant complex parameter and C2 acts on itself as\n\u0012 1\n\u0013\nz\n0\n1 2 .\n\u03c0I (z , z ) =\n, z 1 , z 2 \u2208 C;\n0 z2\n\n(2.22)\n\nis the spectral triple T 0 = (A0 , H0 , D0 ) with [14]\n.\nA0 = A \u2297 A I ,\n\nH 0 = H \u2297 HI ,\n\n.\nD0 = D \u2297 II + \u0393 \u2297 DI\n\n(2.23)\n\nwhere the chirality \u0393 (Z2 graduation of H) satisfies\n\u0393 = \u0393\u2217 ,\n\n\u03932 = I,\n\n\u0393D + D\u0393 = 0.\n\n(2.24)\n\nRequiring T to be even comes from technical reasons due to the definition of the Dirac\noperator in a product of spectral triples [37]. This is compatible with the forthcoming\napplication to quantum spaces.\nSince AI is commutative, pure states of A0 are pairs\n.\n\u03c9 i = (\u03c9, \u03b4 i )\n8\n\n(2.25)\n\n\fII\n\nMINIMAL LENGTH BY SPECTRAL DOUBLING\n\nwhere \u03c9 \u2208 P(A) and \u03b4 i \u2208 P(AI ) is one of the two pure states of C2 ,\n\u03b4 i (z 1 , z 2 ) = z i\n\ni = 1, 2.\n\n(2.26)\n\nIn other terms, P(A0 ) is the disjoint union of two copies of P(A). Restricting to one of\nthe copy, that is considering two pure states \u03c9 i , \u03c9\u0303 i for i = 1 or 2, one finds [28, 30] that\nthe spectral distance dD0 in the doubled spectral triple coincides with the distance in T ,\ndD0 (\u03c9 i , \u03c9\u0303 i ) = dD (\u03c9, \u03c9\u0303).\n\n(2.27)\n\n\u03c91, \u03c92\n\nSimilarly, the distance between two copies\nof the same state \u03c9 \u2208 P(A) coincides\nwith the distance between the two pure states of C2 , which is easily found to equal |\u039b|\u22121 ,\ndD0 (\u03c9 i , \u03c9 j ) = dDI (\u03b4 i , \u03b4 j ) =\n\n1\n.\n|\u039b|\n\n(2.28)\n\nConsequently, as advertised for long in [12], to implement within the framework of the\nspectral distance a non-zero minimal length lP between a state and itself, it suffices to\nview the two arguments of the distance function P(A) \u00d7 P(A) \u2192 R+ as belonging to two\ndistinct copies of P(A) and substitute dD with dD0 , fixing the free parameter in DI as\n\u039b=\n\n1\n.\nlP\n\n(2.29)\n\nThe next step is to extend the substitution dD \u2192 dD0 in a coherent manner to any pairs\nof states (\u03c9, \u03c9\u0303) with \u03c9\u0303 6= \u03c9. This requires the knowledge of the spectral distance dD0 on\nall P(A0 ). At the moment, this information is available only in case A = C0\u221e (M) with M\na even-dimensional spin manifold. The product T 0 is then called an almost commutative\ngeometry, for the quotient of A0 by its center has finite dimension. Such geometries,\nwith AI a suitable matrix algebra, are used in the description of the standard model of\nparticles physics in noncommutative geometry [10]. T then describes the external (i.e\ngravitational) degrees of freedom of spacetime, while TI takes into account the internalg\n(roughly speaking: quantum) degrees of freedom. Almost commutative geometries have\nthe nice property to be orthogonal products in the sense of Pythagoras theorem. Namely,\nwith \u03c9xi \u2208 P(A0 ) ' M \u222a M the evaluation at the point x on the ith copy of M, one gets\n[28, 30]\nq\ndD0 (\u03c9x1 , \u03c9y2 ) =\n\nd2DI (\u03b4 1 , \u03b4 2 ) + d2D (\u03c9x , \u03c9y ).\n\n(2.30)\n\nFor T the spectral triple of the Moyal space, a similar result holds true [29], although\nnot on all P(A0 ) but on the classes of generalized coherent states (see definition III.2).\nThese are physically relevant states since, in the DFR and \u03b8-Minkowski spacetimes, they\nencompass the states of optimal localization (remark III.3), that is to say the states that\nare good candidates to play the role of \"quantum points\" in the quantum spacetime (1.1).\nWe show in details in section IV how to apply the triple doubling technique to these\ngeneralized coherent states, in order to solve the discrepancy between the quantum length\nand the spectral distance regarding the emergence of a minimal length.\nRemark II.4 Once the free parameter \u039b is fixed by (2.29), the distance dD0 between any\npure state of A and itself is \u039b\u22121 . This means that the spectral distance between the two\ncopies of P(A) is constant. In almost commutative geometries, this constraint can be\nrelaxed by using a covariant Dirac operator D + \u0393 \u2297 H where H is a scalar field on M\nwith value in AI (the Higgs field when AI is the internal algebra of the standard model)\n[8]. This amounts to replacing the parameter \u039b by a function \u039b(x) on M, allowing the\ndistance between the two copies of P(C0\u221e (M)) ' M to vary from point to point [14].\ng\n\nHence the index I\n\n9\n\n\fIII\n\nQUANTUM SPACETIMES\n\nIII\n\nQuantum spacetimes\n\nWe shall now introduce the models of quantum spacetime to which we apply the spectral doubling technique described above: namely the Poincar\u00e9 covariant DFR model, the\ndeformed-Poincar\u00e9 invariant \u03b8-Minkowski space and the Moyal plane. From our spectral\ndistance/quantum length perspective, we shall see they are all equivalent.\nIII.1\n\nFrom quantum coordinates to compact operators\n\nLet us recall the general argument justifying why, at small scale, space-time is expected to become noncommutative. In [23] it is shown that to avoid the creation of closed\nhorizons during a localization measurement, a reasonable Ansatz is to impose the following limitation on the accuracy \u2206x\u03bc of a simultaneous measurement of the four spacetime\ncoordinates:\n\u2206x0 (\u2206x1 + \u2206x2 + \u2206x3 ) \u2265 \u03bb2P ,\n\n(3.1)\n\n\u03bb2P .\n\n(3.2)\n\n\u2206x1 \u2206x2 + \u2206x2 \u2206x3 + \u2206x3 \u2206x1 \u2265\n\nThese relations are certainly not the only ones that prevent the formation of closed horizons, but within reasonable assumptions on the measurement process they come out naturally (see [23] for details, [36] for a discussion, [32] for an historical perspective).\nMoreover these relations can be explicitly implemented by selfadjoint operators q\u03bc 's on\nsome Hilbert space H, with the uncertainty in the measurement of the coordinates given\nby the variance\nq\nq\n.\n\u2206\u03c6 q\u03bc = \u03c6 ((q\u03bc \u2212 \u03c6(q\u03bc )I)2 ) = \u03c6(q\u03bc 2 ) \u2212 \u03c6(q\u03bc )2\n(3.3)\nassociated to any state \u03c6 in the domain of q\u03bc2 . In fact, as soon as the q\u03bc 's fulfill the\nquantum conditions\n[Q\u03bc\u03bd , q \u03bb ] = 0,\n1\n[q0 , q1 , q2 , q3 ]2 = \u03bb4P I,\n4\n\n(3.4)\nQ\u03bc\u03bd Q\u03bc\u03bd = 0,\n\n(3.5)\n\nwhere Q\u03bc\u03bd is defined by (1.1) and [q0 , q1 , q2 , q3 ] = \u000f\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03bb q\u03bc q\u03bd q \u03c1 q \u03bb with \u000f\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03bb the totally antisymmetric tensor, then any state \u03c6 in the domain of the [q\u03bc , q\u03bd ]'s satisfies the uncertainties\n(3.1, 3.2) (up to a factor 2) [23]:\n\u03bb2P\n,\n2\n\u03bb2\n\u2206\u03c6 q1 \u2206\u03c6 q2 + \u2206\u03c6 q2 \u2206\u03c6 q3 + \u2206\u03c6 q3 \u2206\u03c6 q1 \u2265 P .\n2\n\u2206\u03c6 q0 (\u2206\u03c6 q1 + \u2206\u03c6 q2 + \u2206\u03c6 q3 ) \u2265\n\n(3.6)\n(3.7)\n\nThe simplest idea to determine a representation of the operators q\u03bc would be to consider\nthe quantum conditions as a definition, that is to look for the representations of the\nalgebra A obtained by taking the quotient of the free algebra generated by elements q\u03bc ,\nQ\u03bc\u03bd satisfying the quantum conditions (3.5), (3.4), with the commutation relation (1.1).\nHowever the requirement (3.4) that the Q\u03bc\u03bd 's are central forbids A to be represented\nas bounded operators on any Hilbert space. Indeed by Schur lemma, in any faithful\nirreducible representation \u03c0 of A one should have\n\u03c0(Q\u03bc\u03bd ) = \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd I\n10\n\n(3.8)\n\n\fIII\n\nQUANTUM SPACETIMES\n\n.\nwhere S = {\u03c3\u03bc\u03bd \u2208 R} is a skew-adjoint matrix. For any pair of indices (\u03bc, \u03bd), formula (1.1)\nis nothing but the Heisenberg commutation relation, which is known to have no bounded\nrepresentation. In other terms the algebra generated by A and I cannot be completed\nas a C \u2217 -algebra. As recalled in [32], this is problematic since selfadjoint elements of a\nnon-C \u2217 algebra need not have real spectrum, which makes the interpretation of the q\u03bc 's\nas physical observables difficult. By analogy with quantum mechanics, one is thus led to\nconsider regular representations [23], which turn out to be all unitarily equivalent by von\nNeumann uniqueness theorem. The q\u03bc 's then become (essentially selfadjoint) unbounded\noperators affiliated to the algebra generated by the Weyl operators.\nAn equivalent point of view comes from group theory. Assuming the matrix S in (3.8)\nis non degenerate forces the dimension d = 2N to be even and turns Rd into a symplectic\n.\nspace, with symplectic form \u03c3(x\u03bc , x\u03bd ) = \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd . Then equations (1.1) and (3.8) define the\nHeisenberg Lie algebra of dimension N with central element i\u03bb2P . By exponentiation, one\n.\ngets the Heisenberg group HN = R2N n R. Now consider the enveloping C \u2217 -algebra\nC \u2217 (L1 (HN )). This is the completion of the Banach *-algebra L1 (HN ) with respect to the\n.\nnorm kf k\u2217 = sup\u03c0 {k\u03c0(f )k}, where the supremum runs over all unitary representations of\nL1 (HN ). But because the Planck length is non-zero, it is reasonable to take into account\nonly the (irreducible) representations with a non-zero central character, that again are all\nunitary equivalent by von Neumann theorem. Closing L1 (HN ) with respect to this single\nclass of representation one finds [19], as a natural algebra associated to the quantum space,\nC \u2217 (L1 (R2N,\u00d7)) ' K,\nwhere \u00d7 denotes the twisted convolution\nZ\n0\ni\u03bb2\nP \u03c3(z ,z)\n.\n2\n(f \u00d7 g)(z) =\nf (z \u2212 z 0 )g(z 0 ) e\u2212\ndz 0\n\n(3.9)\n\n\u2200f, g \u2208 L1 (R2N ),\n\n(3.10)\n\nR2N\n\nand K is the algebra of compact operators.\nIII.2\n\nMoyal plane\n\nThe Moyal product ? is by definition the pull-back through the Fourier transform F\nof the twisted convolution (3.10). Namely [6],\n.\nf ? g = F \u22121 [F [f ] \u00d7 F [g]] ,\n\n(3.11)\n\nwhich makes sense for Schwartz functions f, g \u2208 S(R2N ) since the twisted convolution, as\n.\nthe Fourier transform, maps Schwartz function into Schwartz functions.

Any\nf \u2208 A acts on H as L(f ) \u2297 IM . Note that the CM factor in the representation space is\n.\ndue to the dimension M = 2N of the spin representation and - in particular for N = 1 it has nothing to do with the spectral triple doubling of section II.3.\nThe completion \u0100 of (S(R2N ), ?) with respect to the operator norm of L is isomorphic\nto the algebra of compact operators K (see e.g. [7, section 3.1]). In other terms, the C \u2217 closure of the Moyal algebra is a (reducible) representation of the algebra of the quantum\nspace that came out in (3.9). Furthermore, extending L to the multiplier algebra of A,\nthe quantum coordinates q\u03bc are retrieved as L(x\u03bc ). For these reasons, the Moyal plane\nappears as a common framework where to compare the quantum length with the spectral\ndistance.\nNotice thath there exist other spectral triples in which the closure of the algebra is K,\nfor instance the Podles spheres [16]. However the latter are not isospectral deformations\nof the plane but - in some cases - of the sphere. Since the definition (1.2) of the length\noperator L mimics the formula of the Euclidean distance on the plane, it is meaningful\nto look for analogies between dL and the spectral distance on the Moyal plane. For the\nPodles sphere, one should compare the spectral distance - which, so far, has not been\ncomputed - with a length operator on S 2 as discussed in (2.12).\nIII.3\n\nQuantum points\n\nThe algebra of compact operators K emerges in (3.9) from the mathematical assumption of the centrality of the commutators Q\u03bc\u03bd 's, the restriction to regular representations\nand the value of the Planck length. We shall not discuss here the first two condition (see\n[21, sec.3] as well as [22]). However, in order to have a satisfactory model of spacetime,\nsymmetries must be taken into account: in the same way as C0 (R2N ) carries a natural\nrepresentation of the 2N dimensional Poincar\u00e9 group, one may ask for an action on the\nquantum space, that is\n.\nq\u03bc 7\u2192 q\u03bc0 = \u039b\u03bc\u03b1 q \u03b1 + a\u03bc I\n\n\u039b \u2208 SO(N \u2212 1, 1), a \u2208 R2N .\n\n(3.17)\n\nThe commutation relations (1.1) in an irreducible representation \u03c0 (see (3.8)),\n[\u03c0(q\u03bc ), \u03c0(q\u03bd )] = i\u03bb2P \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd I,\n\n(3.18)\n\nare obviously not invariant under the transformations (3.17). They are covariant if one\nrequires the matrix S = {\u03c3\u03bc\u03bd } to transform under the adjoint action of the Poincar\u00e9 group,\nsince\n[\u03c0(q\u03bc0 ), \u03c0(q\u03bd0 )] = i\u03bb2P (ad\u039b S)\u03bc\u03bd I.\n(3.19)\nh\n\nThanks to G. Landi for this remark.\n\n12\n\n\fIII\n\nQUANTUM SPACETIMES\n\nThis requirement is an essential feature of the DFR model of Poincar\u00e9 covariant quantum\nspacetime and explains why the \"naturally\" associated algebra is no longer K but (see [23]\nfor the original argument, [32] for a nice presentation)\n.\nE = C0 (\u03a3, K) = C0 (\u03a3) \u2297 K,\nwhere\n\n.\n\u03a3 = ad\u039b S0 ,\n\n\u039b \u2208 SO(N \u2212 1, 1)\n\n(3.20)\n(3.21)\n\nis the joint spectrum of the Q\u03bc\u03bd 's.\nBy Gelfand theorem, a point x of Rd is a pure state \u03c9x of C0 (Rd ). Similarly, we take\nas a \"quantum point\" of the DFR quantum space a pure state of the algebra E. These\nare pairs\n.\n(3.22)\n\u03c9S = (\u03c9, \u03b4S ) with \u03c9 \u2208 P(K), \u03b4S \u2208 P(C0 (\u03a3)) ' \u03a3.\nA pair of quantum points (\u03c9S , \u03c9\u0303S\u0303 ) defines a two-\"quantum point\" state \u03c9S \u2297\u03c9\u0303S\u0303 . The latter\nis a pure state of the tensor product of complex algebras E \u2297 E. However, to guarantee\nthat\n[q\u03bc \u2297 I, q\u03bd \u2297 I] = [I \u2297 q\u03bc , I \u2297 q\u03bd ] = i\u03bb2P Q\u03bc\u03bd (I \u2297 I)\n(3.23)\n(that is, the commutators of the coordinates of two independent quantum points are\nequal), it has been proposed in [3] that the tensor product E \u2297C0 (\u03a3) E over the center\nC0 (\u03a3) of E should be used instead. This has several important consequences, for example\nregarding Wick products on quantum spacetime. For our purposes, the following fact will\nbe of importance.\nLemma III.1 Pure states of E \u2297C0 (\u03a3) E are pairs (\u03c9S , \u03c9\u0303S ) composed of two pure states\nof E corresponding to the same point S \u2208 \u03a3.\n.\nProof. E 0 = E \u2297C0 (\u03a3) E is the (completion relative to the maximal C \u2217 -seminorm of the)\nquotient of the algebraic tensor product E\nE by the set I of multiples in E\nE of\n0\nI l \u2212 l I, l \u2208 C0 (\u03a3). Hence P(E ) is the annihilator of I in P(E \u2297 E), that is the set of\npure states \u03c9S \u2297 \u03c9\u0303S\u0303 such that\n\u03c9S \u2297 \u03c9\u0303S\u0303 (f \u2297 gl) = \u03c9S \u2297 \u03c9\u0303S\u0303 (f l \u2297 g),\n\n\u2200f, g \u2208 E, l \u2208 C0 (\u03a3).\n\n(3.24)\n\nExplicitly, one has\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u03c9(f (S)) \u03c9\u0303(g(S\u0303)) l(S\u0303) \u2212 l(S) = 0,\nwhich is true for any f, g, l if and only if S = S\u0303.\n\n(3.25)\n\u0004\n\nAlternatively, rather than Poincar\u00e9-covariance, one can impose Poincar\u00e9 invariance by\ndeforming the Poincar\u00e9 group into the \u03b8-Poincar\u00e9 quantum group [2]. The latter is characterized by non-trivial commutation relations between the generators of translations, which\nguarantees that, under the transformation (3.17), [q\u03bc0 , q\u03bd0 ] = i\u03bb2P \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd . This is the model of\ndeformed-Poincar\u00e9 invariant spacetime, called canonical noncommutative spacetime or \u03b8Minkowski.a To a large extent, as explained in [33], the physical content of \u03b8-Minkowski\nspace is similar to the one of the DFR model. From the quantum length perspective [1],\nas long as one restricts attention to pure states, there is no difference with the DFR model\nat a fixed point S \u2208 \u03a3.\nConsequently, for the DFR model, \u03b8-Minkowski and the Moyal plane, a pair of quantum\npoints is a pair of pure-states of K and it makes sense to compare the quantum length\na\n\nTraditionally the constant commutators are denoted \u03b8\u03bc\u03bd , hence the name of the model. In this paper,\nwe adopt the DFR notation \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd for the components of the symplectic form.\n\n13\n\n\fIII\n\nQUANTUM SPACETIMES\n\nwith the spectral distance associated to the Moyal plane, with \u03b8 = \u03bb2P as a parameter of\ndeformation. In the next subsection, we individuate a subset C of P(K), called generalized\ncoherent states, on which the explicit computation of both the quantum length and the\nspectral distance - as well as their comparison - can be worked out explicitly. This will be\nthe object of section IV.\nFrom now on, we focus on the lowest dimensional Moyal space, that is the Moyal plane\nN = 1. From the DFR point of view, it would be more significant to consider the case\nN = 2 (i.e. d = 4 dimensional space-time) but the spectral distance has been, so far,\ncomputed only for the Moyal plane in [7] and [29]. Of course there is in principle no\nobstruction to compute dD for N > 1 but this is a technical matter that requires some\ncare. Our goal is to compare the length operator with the spectral distance, and the\ndifferences between the two approaches are already clear for N = 1.\nIII.4\n\nGeneralized coherent states\n\nSince all the states of K are normal, pure states are in 1-to-1 correspondence with vector\nstates in the (unique up to equivalence) irreducible representation of K [27].

These are particularly important for the DFR model since they are\nthe states of optimal localization, that is those which minimize the uncertainty (3.6,3.7)\nin the measurement of the coordinates[23].\nIV\n\nLength and distance on quantum space\n\nHaving explained in section III that the closure of the Moyal algebra \u0100 = K and its\npure states are the noncommutative counterpart of C0 (R2N ) and the usual points, it is\nstraightforward to mimic the constructions of section II, substituting C0 (R2N ) with K into\nthe spectral distance formula and the classical multiplicative coordinate operators with\ntheir quantum counterparts q\u03bc = L(x\u03bc ) into the formula of the quantum length. By doing\nso, one gets two notions of distance and length than no longer coincide. In particular,\nwe recall below how a minimal length lP emerges as the minimum of the spectrum of the\nlength operator L, whereas no minimal distance comes out from the spectral distance. We\nthen show how to cure this discrepancy, thanks to the spectral doubling of section II.3.\nIV.1\n\nLength operator in quantum space\n\nLet us consider the DFR model at a fixed point S \u2208 \u03a3, and assume that the quantization is made in the Darboux basis of the symplectic form.

Such\nvector is not an eigenstate of H (For m = 0: coherent states are not pure state of energy\n[11, GV Eq. (41)]; for m 6= 0: see e.g. [29]). Hence |m + \u03bai \u2297 |n + \u03ba\u0303i is not an eigenstate\nof L2 , except for m = n = \u03ba = \u03ba\u0303 = 0.\n\u0004\nIV.2\n\nSpectral distance in the Moyal plane\n\nLet us consider the spectral triple (3.16) of the Moyal plane.\nProposition IV.4 The spectral distance on the Moyal plane is invariant by translation,\ndD (\u03b1\u03ba \u03c6, \u03b1\u03ba \u03c6\u0303) = dD (\u03c6, \u03c6\u0303)\n\n\u2200\u03c6, \u03c6\u0303 \u2208 S(K), \u03ba \u2208 R2 ,\n\n(4.15)\n\nwhere \u03b1\u03ba \u03c6 is defined as in (3.32). Moreover\ndD (\u03b1\u03ba \u03c6, \u03b1\u03ba\u0303 \u03c6) = |\u03ba \u2212 \u03ba\u0303|.\n\n(4.16)\n\nHence the spectral distance takes all possible values in [0, \u221e]. However the distance between\ntwo distinct eigenstates \u03c9m , \u03c9n of the harmonic oscillator is discrete, since\nn\n\u03bbP X 1\n\u221a .\ndD (\u03c9m , \u03c9n ) = \u221a\n2 k=m+1 k\n\n(4.17)\n\nProof. The invariance by translation and eq. (4.16) are proved in [29]. Identifying \u03b8 with\n\u03bb2P , eq.(4.17) is proved in [7, Prop. 3.6]. As well, in [7, Prop. 3.10], states at infinite\ndistance from one another are built.\n\u0004\nConsequently, the common idea that quantizing the coordinates necessarily implies\nthe emergence of a minimal length lP should be handled with care: there exists a well\ndefined (pseudo)-distance on the state space of the algebra K, naturally associated to the\nquantum space (1.1), that is not bounded below by lP .\nIV.3\n\nStates of optimal localization: equivalence quantum length/spectral distance\n\nPropositions IV.3 and IV.4 show that the quantum length on P(K) is bounded below\nfrom zero by\np\n\u221a\nlp = dL (\u03c90 , \u03c90 ) = 2 E0 = 2\u03bbP ,\n(4.18)\n17\n\n\fIV\n\nLENGTH AND DISTANCE ON QUANTUM SPACE\n\nwhile the spectral distance can be made as small as desired. Therefore, in order that a\ncomparison between the two quantities makes sense, it is necessary to implement the minimal length lP within the framework of the spectral distance or, equivalently, to turn the\nquantum length into a true distance. This can be done following the doubling procedure\ndescribed in section II.3, making the product of the spectral triple of the Moyal plane\n(3.16) by the spectral triple (2.21) on C2 .\nTo avoid the square-root problem discussed in section II.2, we shall work with the\nquantum square-length introduced in (2.17):\ndL2 (\u03c9, \u03c9\u0303) = (\u03c9 \u2297 \u03c9\u0303)(L2 ).\n\n(4.19)\n\nOur aim is to implement the non-vanishing of dL2 (\u03c9, \u03c9) as the square of the spectral\ndistance dD0 (\u03c9 1 , \u03c9 2 ) in a double Moyal space. Recall (cf (2.25)) that \u03c9 i denotes the pure\nstate (\u03c9, \u03b4 i ) of A0 = K \u2297 C2 , with \u03c9 \u2208 P(K) and \u03b4 i \u2208 P(C2 ).\nThe point is to fix the parameter \u039b in the Dirac operator DI . Eq.(2.28) yields\ndD0 (\u03c9 1 , \u03c9 2 ) = dDI (\u03b4 1 , \u03b4 2 ) = |\u039b|\u22121 .\n\n(4.20)\n\nThus, identifying dL2 (\u03c9, \u03c9) with d2D0 (\u03c9, \u03c9) for a given \u03c9 \u2208 P(K) forces to fix\n1\n|\u039b| = p\n.\ndL2 (\u03c9, \u03c9)\n\n(4.21)\n\nAs explained in remark II.4, this also fixes\ndD0 (\u03c9\u0303,1 \u03c9\u0303 2 ) = |\u039b\u22121 |\n\n(4.22)\n\nfor any other pure state \u03c9\u0303 \u2208 P(K). But the quantum square-length dL2 (\u03c9\u0303, \u03c9\u0303) is not\nconstant on P(K) (see e.g. (4.10)), so that the identification of d2D0 with dL2 is possible\nonly for states belonging to\n.\nP(\u03c9) = {\u03c9\u0303 \u2208 P(K), dL2 (\u03c9\u0303, \u03c9\u0303) = dL2 (\u03c9, \u03c9)} .\n(4.23)\nIt remains now to check that d2D0 (\u03c9 1 , \u03c9\u0303 2 ) = dL2 (\u03c9, \u03c9\u0303) for any \u03c9\u0303 \u2208 P(\u03c9), \u03c9\u0303 6= \u03c9. This\nrequires the knowledge of dD0 on P(\u03c9). So far, it has been calculated [29] between any two\nstates \u03c9 i , \u03c9\u0303 j with \u03c9\u0303 a translated of \u03c9, that is - with the notations of (3.34) - \u03c9\u0303 belongs to\n. \b\nC(\u03c9) = \u03b1\u03ba \u03c9, \u03ba \u2208 R2 .\n(4.24)\nAs soon as \u03c9 is localized at 0, meaning \u03c9(q\u03bc ) = 0 for \u03bc = 1, 2, then\nC(\u03c9) \u2208 P(\u03c9),\n\n(4.25)\n\nas can be checked by a calculations similar to proposition IV.3. This is true in particular\nfor the generalized coherent states of definition III.2, that is C(\u03c9 = \u03c9m ). Therefore on\nthese states it makes sense to apply the doubling procedure.\nProposition IV.5 Let \u03c9m be an eigenstate of L and let D0 be the Dirac operator in the\ndouble Moyal space with free parameter\n1\n.\n\u039b= p\n.\ndL2 (\u03c9m , \u03c9m )\n\n(4.26)\n\nThen, for any \u03c9 = \u03b1\u03ba \u03c9m , \u03c9\u0303 = \u03b1\u03ba\u0303 \u03c9m \u2208 C(\u03c9m ) \u2282 P(\u03c9m ), the quantum square-length\nidentifies with the spectral distance on the double Moyal space that is,\ndL2 (\u03c9, \u03c9\u0303) = d2D0 (\u03c9 1 , \u03c9\u0303 2 ),\n18\n\n(4.27)\n\n\fIV\n\nLENGTH AND DISTANCE ON QUANTUM SPACE\n\nwhile the spectral distance on a single sheet is\n\nwhere\n\ndD (\u03c9, \u03c9\u0303) = d0L (\u03c9, \u03c9\u0303)\n\n(4.28)\n\n. p\nd0L (\u03c9, \u03c9\u0303) = dL2 (\u03c9, \u03c9\u0303) \u2212 dL2 (\u03c9m , \u03c9m ) = |\u03ba\u0303 \u2212 \u03ba|.\n\n(4.29)\n\nProof. Eq. (4.29) comes from the explicit result on the quantum length (4.10). Eq. (4.28)\nthen follows from proposition IV.4. By (4.22) and (4.21), one gets that (4.27) is equivalent\nto the Pythagoras equality\ndD0 (\u03c9 1 , \u03c9\u0303 2 )2 = dD (\u03c9, \u03c9\u0303)2 + d2D0 (\u03c9\u0303 1 , \u03c9\u0303 2 ),\nwhich is shown in [29] (see also [18]).\n\n(4.30)\n\u0004\n\nFrom the DFR perspective, the states of main interests are those of optimal localization. Since C(\u03c90 ) is precisely the set of pure states of optimal localization (see remark\nIII.3), one obtains as an immediate corollary the link between Connes' spectral distance\nand the DFR length operator, which is the initial motivation of the present paper.\nCorollary IV.6 On the set C(\u03c90 ) of pure states of optimal localization, once solved the\nobvious discrepancy due to the non-zero minimum of the spectrum sp(L), Connes' spectral\ndistance dD and the DFR length operator L capture the same metric information, that is\ndD = d0L .\nIV.4\n\nModified quantum length\n\nViewed as a function on C(\u03c9m ) \u00d7 C(\u03c9m ), d0L vanishes on the diagonal and thus is a\nquantity built from the length operator L for which the \"minimal length problem\" raised\nin section II.2 is actually solved. We shall call d0L the modified quantum length (see figure\n1). Notice that on any C(\u03c9m ), m \u2208 N, d0L is a distance since it coincides with dD .\nRepeating the procedure leading to proposition IV.5 starting with \u03c9n , n 6= m, one fixes\nthe free parameter in DI as \u039b = dL2 (\u03c9n , \u03c9n ) and finds that the spectral distance on C(\u03c9n )\ncoincides with the modified quantum length now defined on C(\u03c9n ) \u00d7 C(\u03c9n ) as\n. p\nd0L (\u03c9, \u03c9\u0303) = dL2 (\u03c9, \u03c9\u0303) \u2212 dL2 (\u03c9n , \u03c9n ).\n(4.31)\nThis suggests the following general definition.\nDefinition IV.7 For any state \u03c9, \u03c9\u0303 in P(K), let us define\np\nd0L (\u03c9, \u03c9\u0303) = |dL2 (\u03c9, \u03c9\u0303) \u2212 \u039b\u22122 (\u03c9, \u03c9\u0303)|,\nwhere\n\n. p\n\u039b\u22122 (\u03c9, \u03c9\u0303) = dL2 (\u03c9, \u03c9) dL2 (\u03c9\u0303, \u03c9\u0303).\n\n(4.32)\n\n(4.33)\n\nThe \u22122 exponent guarantees that \u039b has the dimension of the inverse of a distance, and\nmakes this definition is coherent with (4.29) and (4.31). By proposition IV.5, one obtains\nthat on each C(\u03c9m ), the modified quantum length is a distance and captures the same\nmetric information as the spectral distance. On the whole set of generalized coherent\nstates C = \u222a C(\u03c9m ), the same is true asymptotically in the limits of high energy and of\nn\u2208N\n\nlarge translation.\n19\n\n\fIV\n\nLENGTH AND DISTANCE ON QUANTUM SPACE\n\n~\n\"2\n\n\"2\n1!!\n\n~\n\n\" 02\n(dL )\n\n1/2\n\n=\n\ndD'\n\nlP\n\n1/!\n\n2\n\nd D= d L'\n\"0 1\n\n~1\n\"\n\n\"1\n\nFigure 1: The minimal length lP = dL2 (\u03c90 , \u03c90 ) is the distance dD0 between two copies\n1\n2\n\u03c9\nstate\n\u03c90 .

For instance, in the Euclidean plane, the commutator\nnorm condition\n1\nmax {k\u2202z f k , k\u2202z\u0304 f k} = \u221a\n(5.17)\n2\n25\n\n\fV\n\nINTEGRATIONS OF THE LINE ELEMENT\n\ntakes the form\n\n1\nsup |\u2202z f |z = sup |\u2202z\u0304 f |z = \u221a .\n2\nz\u2208M\nz\u2208M\n\n(5.18)\n\nAsking this condition to be saturated on all the plane, that is\n1\n|\u2202z\u0304 f | = \u221a ,\n2\none retrieves the function l of (5.3) (here z =\nf (z, z\u0304) =\n\n\u221a\n\n(5.19)\n\nx+iy\n\u221a ),\n2\n\n2|z| =\n\n\u221a \u221a\n2 z z\u0304 = l\n\n(5.20)\n\nas the optimal element between any two points aligned with the origin .The geodesics in\nthe plane, Arg(z) = const., come out as the integral curves of \u2207f .\nTo summarize, as far as the geometric information is concerned, the computation of\nthe spectral distance amounts to solving the equation of the geodesics:\n- eq. (5.19) plays the role of the geodesic equation;\n- its solution f = l fully characterizes the geodesic;\n- the valuation of this solution on \u03c9x \u2212 \u03c9y gives the integration of the line element on\na minimal geodesic between x and y.\nLet us now consider the spectral triple of the Moyal plane (3.16). This is an \"isospectral\ndeformation\" of the plane, that is the Dirac operator is still \u2202/. The commutator norm\ncondition yields an equation similar to (5.17), but the operator norm of the left regular\naction L (3.15) takes the place of the supremum norm. So, instead of (5.18) one gets (5.6)\n(or the operator version (5.8)). These equations no longer involve a gradient, so viewing\nthe \"geodesic\" as an integral curve no longer makes sense. However it still makes sense\nto view the equation (5.6) - characterizing the optimal element - as an noncommutative\nequivalent to the geodesic equation, its solution l0 as a noncommutative geodesic, and\nthe valuation on \u03c9m \u2212 \u03c9n as the integral of the noncommutative line element along the\nnoncommutative geodesic. The terminology is coherent with the classical limit since,\nreplacing the Moyal product with the pointwise product, (5.8) yields\n1 z\u0304\n\u2202z l0 = \u221a\n2 |z|\n\n(5.21)\n\nwhich gives the classical geodesic equation (5.19). From this perspective l0 can be viewed\nas a noncommutative deformation of the classical geodesic, in the sense of the spectral\ndistance.\nOn the side of the quantum length, the functions l1 , l2 and l3 also tend to\n\u221a\n(5.22)\nl : z \u2192 2|z|\nin the commutative limit \u03bbP \u2192 0, Hence the li 's are also noncommutative deformation of\nthe classical geodesics, in the sense of the quantum length.\nConsequently, one may interpret the modified quantum length\nd0L (\u03c9m , \u03c9n ) = \u03c9n (l1 ) \u2212 \u03c9m (l1 ) = \u03bbP\n\n26\n\nZ\n\nn+ 12\n\nm+ 12\n\n1\n\u221a dk,\n2k\n\n(5.23)\n\n\fVI\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nand the spectral distance\ndD (\u03c90 , \u03c9n ) = \u03c90 (l0 ) \u2212 \u03c9n (l0 ) = \u03bbP\n\nn\nX\nk=m\n\n1\n\u221a\n2k\n\n(5.24)\n\nas two geodesic distances, corresponding to the integration of the same noncommutative\nline element \u03bbP \u221a12k along two distinct \"quantum geodesics\": a continuous one l1 (for\nd0L is the integral of the line element); a discrete one l0 (for dD is a discrete sum of\nthe line element). From this perspective, both the quantum length and the spectral\ndistance \"quantize\" the length element, but with the spectral distance one also quantizes\nthe geodesic.\nVI\n\nConclusion\n\nThere is no obvious ways to compare Connes' spectral distance with the DFR and\n\u03b8-Minkowski length operator L, because of the non-zero minimum lP of the spectrum\nof L, opposed to the continuum of value [0, \u221e] taken by the spectral distance dD on\nthe Moyal plane. In this paper, we have extracted from the length operator a quantity\nd0L - the modified quantum length - and have shown that it coincides exactly with the\nspectral distance dD on any set C(\u03c9m ), consisting in all the translations of an eigenstate\n\u03c9m of the harmonic oscillator. Equivalently, the (non-modified) quantum square-length\ndL2 coincides with the square of the spectral distance dD0 on a double Moyal space. To\nsummarize, implementing a minimal length lP within the spectral distance framework\n- by doubling the spectral triple - is equivalent to correcting the quantum length - by\nsubtracting the desired quantity lP - so that to turn it into a true distance. Limited to\none single pair of state (\u03c9m , \u03c9m ), the procedure is purely formal and amounts to fix to\nlp\u22121 the free parameter \u039b characterizing the doubling process. The interesting fact is\nthat the procedure can be extended in a coherent way, either exactly to any C(\u03c9m ), or\nasymptotically on their union C = \u222a C(\u03c9m ). Furthermore, the small energy discrepancy\nm\u2208N\n\nhas a natural interpretation in terms of integrations of the same noncommutative line\nelement along two distinct geodesics.\nLet us underline that most of the definitions discussed in this paper still make sense\nwhen the algebra is no longer K (i.e. when the states are not necessarily vector states),\nwhich may happen for models of quantum spacetime with non-central Q\u03bc\u03bd 's.\nFrom a physical point of view, the interpretation of the doubling procedure can be the\nfollowing c . The discrepancy between the quantum length and the spectral distance reflects\nthe difference in the quantum object one is handling. Viewed as a generalization of the\nWasserstein distance of optimal transport [17], dD is a distance between two probability\ndistributions. From a quantum mechanics perspective, it measures the difference between\ntwo quantum states of a single event. It is tautological to claim that there is no difference\nbetween a quantum system in a state \u03c6 and the same quantum system in the same state \u03c6.\nHence the vanishing of dD (\u03c6, \u03c6). On the contrary, \u03c6 \u2297 \u03c6 describes the state of a two-point\nsystem. Two copies of the same system can be in the same quantum state \u03c6, yet, they\nare two distinct copies. Hence dL (\u03c6, \u03c6) = (\u03c6 \u2297 \u03c6)(L) does not vanish.\nBy doubling the spectral triple, one reconciles the two points of view: two quantum\npoints \u03c9, \u03c9\u0303 in P(K) can be equivalently seen as a state \u03c9 \u2297 \u03c9\u0303\u0001of P(K) \u2297 P(K), on which\none evaluates the length operator; or as a pair of states \u03c9 1 , \u03c9\u0303 2 in P(K) \u2297 P(C2 ), between\nwhich one computes the spectral distance dD0 . For this to make sense, the correct objects\nc\n\nFor an alternative view on the physical meaning of the doubling of spectral triples, see the recent\npaper [35].\n\n27\n\n\fVI\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nto be compared are not the spectral distance and the quantum length, but either the\nspectral distance dD0 in the double Moyal space with the quantum square-length dL2 or\n- equivalently by Pythagoras equalities- the spectral distance dD in a single Moyal space\nwith the modified quantum length d0L .\nOne might wonder whether it is possible to obtain d0L (\u03c9, \u03c9\u0303) as the mean value of L2\non a suitableP\nvector state. Writing \u03c9 = \u03c9\u03c81 , \u03c9\u0303 = \u03c9\u03c82 , there exists no linear combination\n\u03c6(\u03c81 , \u03c82 ) = i,j=1,2 \u03bbij \u03c8i \u2297 \u03c8j such that d0L (\u03c9, \u03c9\u0303) would equal \u03c9\u03c6(\u03c81 ,\u03c82 ) (L2 ) for any\n\u03c81 , \u03c82 . If this were true, then d0L (\u03c9, \u03c9) = 0 would imply that \u03c9\u03c6(\u03c8,\u03c8) (L2 ) vanishes, whereas\none has\n\u0001\n\u03c9\u03c6(\u03c8,\u03c8) (L2 ) = 2h\u03c6 (\u03c8, \u03c8) , da\u2217 da + \u03bb2P (I \u2297 I) \u03c6(\u03c8, \u03c8)i \u2265 2\u03bb2P .\n(6.1)\nThis justifies a posteriori the restriction to separable states discussed in section II.2. Besides being the most simple way to associate a number to a pair of states together with\nthe length operator L, our definition of the quantum length allows to build the quantity\nd0L . This coincides with Connes' spectral distance on a class of physically relevant states,\nand its definition is mathematically simple: d0L is the quantum square-length of a pair of\nstates minus the arithmetic mean of the quantum square-lengths of each state.\nFinally, let us mention a recent result of Wallet [38] which sheds an intriguing light\non the classical limit \u03bbP \u2192 0 of quantum spacetime. Let us recall that a coherent state,\ni.e. a state of optimal localization, is by definition a quantum state \u03c9 of the harmonic\noscillator whose evaluations on the position, momentum and energy observables reproduce\nthe values of a classical oscillator. The coherent state \u03c9 is thus fully characterized by a\ncomplex number c such that |c| is the amplitude of the corresponding classical oscillator,\nand Arg(c) its phase. One then shows (e.g. [29, Prop. IV.2]) that\n\u221a \u03c9 is the translated\n.\n\u03b1\u03ba \u03c90 of the ground state with an amplitude of translation \u03ba = \u03bbp 2c. Consequently, at\nthe limit \u03bbP \u2192 0, any two coherent states \u03b1\u03ba \u03c90 , \u03b1\u03ba\u0303 \u03c90 tend to the Dirac measure at the\norigin. Accordingly, their relative spectral distance dD (\u03b1\u03ba \u03c90 , \u03b1\u03ba\u0303 \u03c90 ) = |\u03ba \u2212 \u03ba\u0303| tends to 0.\nTherefore, in order to obtain the Euclidean distance as the limit of the spectral distance\nbetween coherent states, one should send \u03bbP to zero keeping the amplitude of translation\nconstant. This amounts to multiply the spectral distance by \u03bb\u22121\nP . In his paper, Wallet\nhas shown that such an homothetic transformation of the Moyal plane can be obtained by\nadding to the Dirac operator an harmonic term, that had been previously introduced in\na completely different context [25] to study the renormalizability of quantum field theory\non noncommutative spacetimes.\n\nAcknowledgements\nMany thanks to Francesco D'Andrea, who took part in a preliminary version of this\npaper and noticed, in [7], what became equation (5.7) here.
