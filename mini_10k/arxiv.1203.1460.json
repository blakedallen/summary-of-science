The great appeal of unconventional atomic systems for experiments on ultracold atomic\nquantum gases stems from the possibility of engineering complex interactions and of accessing rich atomic energy spectra. Both features are at the foundation of a number of novel\nfascinating phenomena. For instance the energy spectra of\ntwo-valence-electron species, as alkaline earth and alkalineearth-like atoms, feature narrow and ultra-narrow optical transitions, which are key ingredients for ultra-precise atomic\nclocks [1], efficient quantum computation schemes [2], and\nnovel laser cooling approaches as beautifully demonstrated in\nexperiments with Sr, Yb, and Ca [3\u20135].\nAs a next step in complexity, multi-valence-electron atoms\nwith non-S electronic ground state such as lanthanides are currently attracting an increasing experimental and theoretical interest. Among many, one of the special features of lanthanides\nis the exceptionally large magnetic dipole moment of atoms in\nthe electronic ground state (e. g. 7 \u03bcB for Er and 10 \u03bcB for both\nDy and Tb), which provides a unique chance to study strongly\ndipolar phenomena with atoms. Highly magnetic atoms interact with each other not only via the usual contact interaction\nbut also via an anisotropic and long-range interaction, known\nas the dipole-dipole interaction [6]. Chromium was the first\natomic species used for experiments on atomic dipolar quantum gases [7, 8], and the even more magnetic lanthanides are\nnowadays in the limelight thanks to laser cooling experiments\non Er and Tm [9, 10] and to the recent realization of quantumdegenerate Dy gases [11, 12].\nSimilarly to Yb and the alkaline earth atoms, the atomic\nenergy spectra of magnetic lanthanides include broad, narrow, and ultra-narrow optical transitions. This collection of\nlines is reflected in a wide choice of possible schemes for\nlaser cooling experiments. However, all experiments on Zeeman slowing and cooling in a magneto-optical trap (MOT)\nwith magnetic lanthanides so far relied on an approach, essentially based on the strongest cycling transition [9, 10, 13].\nThis broad transition typically lies in the blue between 400\nand 430 nm and has a linewidth on the order of few tens of\n\n25\n\nenergy (1000 cm -1 )\n\narXiv:1203.1460v2 [physics.atom-ph] 16 May 2012\n\n1 Institut f\u00fcr Experimentalphysik and Zentrum f\u00fcr Quantenphysik,\nUniversit\u00e4t Innsbruck, Technikerstrasse 25, 6020 Innsbruck, Austria\n2 Jo\u017eef Stefan Institute, Jamova 39, SI-1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia\n3 Institut f\u00fcr Quantenoptik und Quanteninformation, \u00d6sterreichische Akademie der Wissenschaften, 6020 Innsbruck, Austria\n(Dated: August 3, 2018)\n\n20\n\n4f12(3H6) 6s6p(1P1)\n\n15\n\n4f12(3H6) 6s6p(3P1)\n\n10\n\nZS light\n(401 nm)\n\n5\n\nMOT light\n(583 nm)\n4f126s2 3H6\n\n0\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\nJ\n\nFIG. 1: (color online).

As a consequence, the Doppler temperature is close\nto a mK. Such a high temperature makes direct loading from\na MOT into a dipole trap difficult and inefficient, even when\nsub-Doppler mechanisms take place [14, 15]. To further decrease the temperature of atoms prior to the dipole trap loading, an additional MOT stage based on an ultra-narrow kHzlinewidth transition was applied in Refs. [11, 13], making the\nwhole experimental procedure more involved.\nTaking advantage of the rich atomic spectrum of lanthanides, we identify a different transition to be the most suitable one for MOT operation towards production of a quantumdegenerate gas. This transition, which for Er lies at 583 nm\nand has a linewidth of 190 kHz, represents an intermediate\ncase between the broad (blue) and the ultra-narrow (red) transitions available in the lanthanide spectra and has very similar\nproperties to the Yb intercombination line [16, 17]. Based on\n\n\f2\nthis narrow yellow line, we demonstrate a MOT of 2 \u00d7 108\nEr atoms at a temperature as low as 15 \u03bc K. Our approach,\ninspired by Yb experiments [4], provides better starting conditions for direct loading into a dipole trap than the conditions\nachieved in other experiments with magnetic lanthanides [11].\nErbium is a heavy rare-earth element of the lanthanide series. It has six stable isotopes, among which three bosonic\nisotopes 166 Er (34%), 168 Er (27%), and 170 Er (15%) and the\nfermionic isotope 167 Er (23%) have high natural abundance.\nThe Er electronic configuration is characterized by a xenonlike core, an inner open 4 f shell, and an outer closed 6s shell,\n[Xe]4f12 6s2 . The electron vacancies in the inner f shell are a\ncommon feature of all the lanthanides (with the exception of\nYb) and are at the origin of the strong magnetism as well as\nvarious interesting collisional effects [18\u201320].\nThe atomic level spectrum of Er is shown in Fig. 1. In the\nground state, Er has a highly anisotropic electronic density\ndistribution with a large orbital angular momentum L = 5 (Hstate) and a total electronic angular momentum J = 6. The\nbosonic isotopes have zero nuclear spin (I = 0) and consequently do not exhibit a hyperfine structure. On the contrary,\nthe fermionic isotope 167 Er has a nuclear spin I = 7/2, leading to eight hyperfine levels, from F = 5/2 to F = 19/2, in\nthe electronic ground state.\nIn Ref. [22], five different J \u2192 J + 1 laser cooling transitions were identified with linewidths ranging from tens of\nMHz to a few Hz. Here we focus on the blue and the yellow transition at 401 nm and at 583 nm, respectively; see arrows in Fig. 1. The corresponding excited levels are the singlet\n1\nP1 and triplet 3 P1 states coming from the transition of an selectron into a p-shell. The strong blue transition at 401 nm\nhas a linewidth of \u0393401 /2\u03c0 = 27.5 MHz [23], corresponding\nto a Doppler temperature of h\u0304\u0393401 /(2kB ) = 660 \u03bc K. We use\nthe blue light for both Zeeman slowing and transversal cooling of the Er atomic beam. The MOT operates on the narrow yellow transition at 583 nm, which has a natural linewidth\nof \u0393583 /2\u03c0 = 190 kHz and a corresponding Doppler temperature of 4.6 \u03bc K. The line may exhibit weak leaks from the\nexcited level into two intermediate levels with very low calculated leakage rates (0.017 s\u22121 and 0.0049 s\u22121 ) [22]. Note\nthat we find these losses irrelevant for all practical purposes.\nFor 167 Er the hyperfine structure in the 401- and 583-nm excited states gives rise to eight levels ranging from F \u2032 = 7/2\nto F \u2032 = 21/2. For the 583-nm line, the hyperfine constants\nare known [24]. Contrary, the hyperfine constants for the 401nm line are currently unknown, making the operation of the\nfermionic MOT more challenging.\nWe generate the blue light from two independent blue diode\nlasers injection locked to a master laser. The master laser\nlight is produced by frequency doubling methods based on\na tapered amplified diode laser at 802 nm. The blue light\nfrom the master laser is locked to a hollow-cathode discharge\nlamp [4] via modulation transfer spectroscopy. With this setup\nwe spectroscopically resolve the lines of the four most abundant bosonic isotopes as well as the hyperfine structure of\nthe fermionic isotope 167 Er. Since the hyperfine constants\n\nof the excited level at 401 nm are unknown we could not assign the absorption features to specific hyperfine transitions.\nWe derive the yellow light from a dye laser operating with\nRhodamin 6G. By using an intracavity EOM and an external reference cavity, we stabilize the laser to a linewidth of\nabout 50 kHz. By additionally locking the laser to an ultralow-expansion cavity, we achieve a long-term stability better\nthan 30 kHz within a day [25].\nOur experimental procedure is as follows. We load the Zeeman slowed atomic beam from an effusive, high-temperature\noven directly into the narrow-line MOT. Our commercial oven\ntypically operates at a temperature of 1300 \u25e6C, which is about\n200 \u25e6C below the Er melting point. Two 3-mm apertures, separated by 50 mm, provide a geometrical collimation of the\natomic beam. In addition, the atomic beam is further collimated and transversally cooled by a 2D optical molasses,\nworking on the broad 401-nm transition with a total power of\nabout 100 mW. The beams are elliptically shaped to increase\nthe interaction time between the atoms and the light. Thanks\nto the transversal cooling stage, we increase the loading flux\nby almost an order of magnitude.\nThe atomic beam then enters the Zeeman slower (ZS). Because of the limited capture velocity (a few m/s) imposed by\nthe narrow cooling transition used for the MOT, it is crucial to\ndesign a ZS that provides enough atomic flux at low velocities\n[4]. We build a 360 mm long spin-flip Zeeman slower, which\ncan slow the atoms from 500 m/s to about 5 m/s. The ZS light\nis focused at the oven position and has a total power of about\n60 mW. At the MOT position, we estimate a beam diameter of\nabout 11 mm, corresponding to an intensity of about one Is,401,\nwhere Is,401 = 56 mW/cm2 is the saturation intensity. Our ZS\noperates with light detuned by about \u221220 \u0393401 (\u2212540 MHz)\nfrom the unshifted resonance.\nThe narrow-line MOT is operated in a standard six beam\nconfiguration with retro-reflected beams. To increase the capture velocity of the MOT, we use large MOT beam diameters of about 30 mm. Typical MOT loading parameters include a magnetic field gradient B\u2032 (along the symmetry axis)\nof 4 G/cm, a laser intensity of 12 Is,583 per beam with Is,583 =\n0.13 mW/cm2, and a detuning \u03b4583 from the atomic transition\nof \u221250 \u0393583 (\u22129.5 MHz). To measure the number of atoms\nin the MOT after loading, we optically compress the MOT by\nreducing \u03b4583 to \u22120.5 \u0393583 and we apply standard absorption\nimaging on the blue transition.\nA special feature of our narrow-line MOT is the large detuning of the MOT light (typically \u221250 \u0393583) needed for optimal loading. At this detuning, we observe a very strong effect of gravity on the position and shape of the atom cloud\n[3]. The atoms are located well below the center of the magnetic quadrupole field, and the cloud takes the form of a large\nsemi-shell. To elucidate the reason for the large detuning, we\nmonitor the loading dynamics and the lifetime of the MOT;\nsee Fig. 2. Our measurements focus on the 166 Er isotope, but\nwe have observed the same qualitative behavior also for the\nother isotopes.\nFigure 2(a) shows the atom number in the MOT as a func-\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 2: (color online). Loading (a) and decay (b) of the narrowline MOT with 166 Er atoms for \u03b4583 = \u221250\u0393583 (circles) and \u03b4583 =\n\u221232\u0393583 (triangles). (a) Atom numbers are plotted as a function\nof the MOT loading time. The solid lines are fits to the data using N(t) = Nss (1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b3 t ) with Nss = R/\u03b3 . From the fits we obtain \u03b3 = 0.137(2) s\u22121 , R = 2.6(4) \u00d7 107 s\u22121 , and \u03b3 = 0.200(4) s\u22121 ,\nR = 1.1(1) \u00d7 107 s\u22121 for \u221250\u0393583 and \u221232\u0393583 , respectively. The\ninset shows the atom number after 10 s loading time as a function of\nthe MOT detuning. (b) Atom numbers are plotted as a function of the\nholding time in the MOT in presence (empty symbols) and absence\nof the ZS light (filled symbols). The solid lines are fits to the data\nusing a double exponential function; see text.\n\ntion of the loading time for different values of \u03b4583 . We fit\nour data by using a standard loading rate equation [26], which\nincludes a capture rate R and a decay rate \u03b3 ; the latter accounts for both collisions between trapped atoms and collisions with the background gas. For a detuning of \u221250 \u0393583\nthe atom number approaches its steady state in about 10 s\nwith Nss \u2248 2 \u00d7 108 . For a lower value of the detuning to\n\u221232 \u0393583 we observe a substantial decrease of the atom number to Nss \u2248 5 \u00d7 107 . This behavior is clearly shown in the\ninset, where we monitor the number of atoms Nss for a fixed\nloading time of 10 s as a function of the MOT light detuning.\nFor detunings exceeding \u03b4583 = \u221230 \u0393583 we observe a rapid\nincrease in the atom number. When further increasing the detuning, Nss first stays constant and then rapidly decreases.\nWe believe that the large detuning of the MOT light serves\nus to minimize the detrimental effects of off-resonant pumping processes driven by the ZS light. According to the Zeeman shift in the quadrupole field of the MOT, we observe a\nspatial displacement of the atomic cloud with \u03b4583 of about\n1.4 mm/MHz [27]. For large detunings, this shift becomes so\nlarge that the atoms can no longer be kept in the MOT. For in-\n\ntermediate detunings in the range from \u221240 to \u221255 \u0393583, the\ncloud displacement is advantageous for MOT operation since\nthe atoms become spatially separated from the region of interaction with the ZS light. For small detunings, the ZS light\nleads to substantial losses of atoms.\nThe effect of the ZS light also shows up in lifetime measurements, where we monitor the number of atoms in the MOT as\na function of the holding time with the ZS light being present\nor absent; see Fig. 2(b). For these measurements we switch off\nthe ZS magnetic field and the atomic beam after 10 s of MOT\nloading. For large detuning (\u03b4583 = \u221250 \u0393583) the evolution of\nthe atom number is not affected by the ZS light. In both cases,\ni. e. with the ZS light on and off, we observe faster losses in\nthe earlier stage of the decay, which we attribute to inelastic\ntwo-body collisional processes, and a slower decay at a later\ntime, which is finally limited by background collisions. For\nsimplicity we use a double-exponential fit function to estimate\nthe time constants [28]. We extract time constants of 19(3) s\nand 80(20) s for the fast and slow dynamics, respectively. At\nlower MOT detuning (\u221232 \u0393583), the ZS light strongly affects\nthe decay. When the blue light is turned off, our observations\nare qualitatively similar to the ones at \u221250 \u0393583 while with the\nblue light turned on the atomic loss dramatically increases. In\nthis case the decay curve is well described by a single exponential function with a time constant \u03c4 = 9.0(1) s. This decay\ntime is consistent with a simple estimate of pumping losses.\nBy considering the absorption rate \u0393a of the 401-nm light at\nthe actual intensity and detuning [29] and the branching ratio\nb for decay from the excited state to all the possible metastable\nstates [9], we estimate a decay rate 1/\u03c4 = b\u0393a of the order of\n0.1 s\u22121 .\nWe could also demonstrate trapping of all the other Er isotopes, with the exception of the rare 162 Er (0.1% natural abundance). For all the bosonic isotopes we used about the same\nvalues for the detuning of the ZS and the MOT light. Figure\n3(a) shows the atom number in the MOT for the different isotopes as a function of their natural abundance. For a long loading time of 20 s we observe similar atom numbers exceeding\n108 for the three most abundant bosonic isotopes, indicating\nthat saturation effects might apply. For a short loading time\nof 5 s, the atom number increases with the natural abundance.\nHowever, we observe a more complicated behavior than the\nexpected linear growth. This might be due to slight differences in the optimal MOT parameters, but may also point to\ndifferences in scattering and collisional properties among the\ndifferent isotopes.\nFor the fermionic isotope 167 Er we observe a MOT with\natom number of about 3 \u00d7 107 , which is substantially lower\nthan the numbers measured for the bosonic isotopes. A simple explanation of this behavior can be that we decelerate and\ncool only atoms in the F = 19/2 hyperfine state, which has a\nstatistical weight of about 20%. Note that a similar behavior\nhas been observed with the fermionic 161 Dy MOT, which also\nshows lower atom numbers than the ones of bosonic MOTs\n[13]. An additional complication stems from the unknown hyperfine splitting of the 401-nm line. From the spectroscopic\n\n\f4\nsuccessfully implemented with Dy, Ho and Tm, using the 626nm (\u0393/2\u03c0 = 135 kHz) [30], the 598-nm (\u0393/2\u03c0 = 146 kHz)\n[31], and the 531-nm (\u0393/2\u03c0 = 370 kHz) [32] transitions, respectively.\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated an efficient and simple approach for an Er MOT based on a single narrow-line\ntransition. Our scheme works with all abundant Er isotopes\nand allows for direct loading of an optical dipole trap. In first\nexperiments we were able to load up to 107 Er atoms into\nthe dipole trap in a single focused-beam configuration. Optimization of the dipole trap loading and evaporative cooling\nexperiments are under way in our laboratory.\n\nFIG. 3: (color online). Behavior of different Er isotopes. (a) MOT\natom number for the four most abundant bosonic isotopes as well as\nfor the 167 Er fermionic isotope is plotted as a function of the natural\nabundance for 20 s (squares) and 5 s (circles) loading time. (b) Spectroscopy signal of the blue transition shows the isotope shifts for the\nbosonic isotopes and the HF structure of 167 Er. The arrow indicates\nthe locking point used for the ZS light to produce the 167 Er MOT.\n\nsignal we could not identify a priori where to lock the Zeeman slower light to be resonant with the desired F = 19/2 \u2192\nF \u2032 = 21/2 hyperfine transition. To produce the 167 Er MOT, we\nhad to proceed blindly by first locking the 583-nm MOT light\non the cooling transition and by then trying different locking\npoints for the ZS light until the MOT was visible. We finally\nsucceed in creating a MOT by locking the ZS light to the spectroscopic line located 150 MHz below the blue transition frequency of the 166 Er isotope; see the arrow in Fig. 3(b).\nAfter loading the MOT we apply a stage of compression\nto reduce the temperature of the atomic cloud and to achieve\ngood starting conditions for direct loading of an optical dipole\ntrap. With the optimized parameters \u03b4583 = \u22120.5 \u0393583, I =\n0.16 Is,583, and B\u2032 = 0.8 G/cm, we measure a temperature\nof 15 \u03bc K via time-of-flight experiments. In addition, SternGerlach experiments indicate that atoms in the compressed\nMOT phase are naturally pumped in the lowest Zeeman sublevel mJ = \u22126 by the MOT light. This can be explained by\nconsidering a combined effect of the narrow cooling transition used for the MOT and of gravity. The latter pushes the\natoms downward creating an effective imbalance in the trap\nand leading to a preferential absorbtion of the \u03c3 \u2212 polarized\nlight from the lower vertical beam. For 2 \u00d7 108 atoms at\nT = 15 \u03bc K we estimate a peak number density of the polarized\nsample of 1.5 \u00d7 1011 cm\u22123 , corresponding to a phase-space\ndensity of about 4 \u00d7 10\u22126. These values are similar to the ones\nobserved in Yb experiments using the intercombination light\n[4]. Compared to other experiments on magnetic lanthanides,\nsuch as Dy [11], our much simpler approach based on a single\ncooling light for the MOT provides higher atom numbers and\nsimilar final temperatures. We suggest that this scheme can be\n\nWe are grateful to J. J. McClelland and A. J. Berglund for\nsharing with us their precious knowledge on Er and to\nS. Kotochigova, O. Dulieu, M. Lepers, and J.
