Hence, the rings of quotients of C(X) as well as their\nmetric completions are represented as rings of Hausdorff continuous functions.\n\nMathematics Subject Classification (2000): 54C30, 54C40, 13B02, 26E25\nKey words: Hausdorff continuous, rational extension, rings of quotients, rings of functions\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nLet B be a commutative ring with identity and let A be a subring of B having the same\nidentity. The ring B is called a rational extension or a ring of quotients of A if for every b \u2208 B\nthe subring b\u22121 A = {a \u2208 A : ba \u2208 A} is rationally dense in B, that is, b\u22121 A does not have\nnonzero annihilators. Any ring A has a maximal rational extension Q(A). The ring Q(A) is\nalso called a complete or total ring of quotients of A. The classical ring of quotients\n\u001a\n\u001b\np\nQcl (A) =\n: p, q \u2208 A, q is not a zero divisor\nq\nis, in general, a subring of Q(A). A ring without proper rational extension is called rationally\ncomplete.\nIt is well known that the ring C(X) of all continuous real functions on a topological space X\nis not rationally complete. Our goal is to represent the rational extensions of C(X) as rings of\nfunctions defined on the same domain, namely as rings of Hausdorff continuous (H-continuous)\nfunctions on X. The H-continuous functions are a special class of extended interval valued\nfunctions, that is, their range, or target set, is IR = {[a, a] : a, a \u2208 R = R \u222a {\u00b1\u221e}, a \u2264 a}.\nDue to a certain minimality condition, they are not unlike the usual continuous functions. For\ninstance, they are completely determined by their values on any dense subset of the domain.\nMore precisely, for H-continuous functions f , g and a dense subset D of X we have\nf (x) = g(x), x \u2208 D =\u21d2 f (x) = g(x), x \u2208 X.\n\n(1)\n\nWithin the realm of Set-Valued Analysis, the H-continuous functions can be identified with the\nminimal upper semi-continuous compact set-valued (usco) maps from X into R, [3].\nWe extend the ring structure on C(X) to the set Hnf (X) of all nearly finite H-continuous\nfunctions following the approach in [5]. We show further that the ring Hnf (X) is rationally\ncomplete. Hence, it contains all rational extensions of C(X). The maximal and classical rings\nof quotients are represented as subrings of Hnf (X).\n1\n\n\fLet || * || denote the supremum norm on the set Cbd (X) of the bounded continuous functions.\nThen\nf \u2212g\n(2)\n\u03c1(f, g) =\n1 + |f \u2212 g|\nis a metric on C(X), which can be extended further to Q(C(X)). We prove that its completion\nQ(C(X)) with respect to this metric is exactly Hnf (X). The Dedekind completions C(X)#\nand Cbd (X)# of C(X) and Cbd (X) with respect to the pointwise partial order, being subrings\nof Q(C(X)), also admit a convenient representation as rings of H-continuous functions. These\nresults significantly improve earlier results of Fine, Gillman and Lambek [14], where the considered rings are represented as direct limits of rings of continuous functions on dense subsets of\nX and \u03b2X.\n\n2\n\nThe ring of nearly finite Hausdorff continuous functions\n\nWe recall [16] that an interval function f : X \u2192 IR is called S-continuous if its graph is a closed\nsubset of X \u00d7 R. An interval function f : X \u2192 IR is Hausdorff continuous (H-continuous) if it\nis an S-continuous function which is minimal with respect to inclusion, that is, if \u03c6 : \u03a9 \u2192 IR\nis an S-continuous function then \u03c6 \u2286 f implies \u03c6 = f . Here the inclusion is considered in a\npoint-wise sense. We denote by H(X) the set of H-continuous functions on X.\nGiven an interval a = [a, a] \u2208 IR,\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 a \u2212 a if a, a finite,\n+\u221e\nif a < a = +\u221e or a = \u2212\u221e < a,\nw(a) =\n\uf8f3\n0\nif a = a = \u00b1\u221e,\n\nis the width of a, while |a| = max{|a|, |a|} is the modulus of a. An interval a is called proper\ninterval, if w(a) > 0 and point interval, if w(a) = 0. Identifying a \u2208 R with the point interval\n[a, a] \u2208 IR, we consider R as a subset of IR. H-continuous functions are similar to the usual real\nvalued continuous real functions in that they assume proper interval values only on a set of First\nBaire category, that is, for every f \u2208 H(X) the set Wf = {x \u2208 X : w(f (x)) > 0} is countable\nunion of closed and nowhere dense set, [2]. Furthermore, f is continuous on X \\ Wf . If X is a\nBaire space, X \\ Wf is also dense in X. Thus, in this case, f is completely determined by its\npoint values. This approach is used for defining linear space operations [7] and ring operations\n[5] for H-continuous functions. Here we do not make any such assumption on X. Hence the\napproach is different.\nFor every S-continuous function g we denote by hgi the set of H-continuous functions contained in g, that is,\nhgi = {f \u2208 H(\u03a9) : f \u2286 g}.\nIdentifying {f } with f we have hf i = f whenever f is H-continuous. The S-continuous functions\ng such that the set hgi is a singleton, that is, it contains only one function, play an important\nrole in the sequel. In analogy with the H-continuous functions, which are minimal S-continuous\nfunctions, we call these functions quasi-minimal S-continuous functions [3]. The following characterization of the quasi-minimal S-continuous functions is useful.\nTheorem 1 Let f be an S-continuous function on X. Then f is quasi- minimal S-continuous\nfunction if and only if for every \u03b5 > 0 the set\nWf,\u03b5 = {x \u2208 X : w(f (x)) \u2265 \u03b5}\nis closed and nowhere dense in X.\n\n\fProof. Let us assume that an S-continuous function f is not quasi-minimal. Then there exist\nH-continuous functions \u03c6 = [\u03c6, \u03c6] and \u03c8 = [\u03c8, \u03c8], \u03c6 6= \u03c8 such that \u03c6 \u2286 f and \u03c8 \u2286 f . Due to the\nminimality property of H-continuous functions the set {x \u2208 X : \u03c6(x) \u2229 \u03c8(x) = \u2205} is open and\ndense subset of X. Let a \u2208 X be such that \u03c6(a) \u2229 \u03c8(a) = \u2205. Without loss of generally we may\nassume that \u03c8(a) < \u03c6(a). Let \u03b5 = 31 (\u03c6(a) \u2212 \u03c8(a)). Using that \u03c6 and \u03c6 are respectively upper\nsemi-continuous and lower semi-continuous functions, there exists an open neighborhood V of a\nsuch that \u03c8(x) < \u03c8(a) + \u03b5 < \u03c6(a) \u2212 \u03b5 < \u03c6(x) , x \u2208 V . Then\nw(f )(x) \u2265 \u03c6(x) \u2212 \u03c8(x) > \u03c8(a) \u2212 \u03c6(a) \u2212 2\u03b5 = \u03b5, x \u2208 V.\nHence V \u2282 Wf,\u03b5 , which implies that Wf,\u03b5 is not nowhere dense. Therefore, if Wf,\u03b5 is nowhere\ndense for every \u03b5 > 0 then f is quasi-minimal.\nNow we prove the inverse implication, that is, that for any S-continuous quasi-minimal\nfunction f and \u03b5 > 0 the set Wf,\u03b5 is closed and nowhere dense. Assume the opposite. Since\nfor an S-continuous function f the set Wf,\u03b5 is always closed, this means that there exists an\nS-continuous function f = [f , f ] and \u03b5 > 0 such that Wf,\u03b5 is not nowhere dense. Hence there\nexists an open set V such that V \u2286 Wf,\u03b5 . Then there exist an H-continuous functions \u03c6 on V\nsuch that \u03c6(x) \u2286 [f (x), f (x) \u2212 \u03b5], x \u2208 V . The we have \u03c6(x) + \u03b5 \u2286 [f (x), f (x) \u2212 \u03b5], x \u2208 V . It is\neasy to see that the functions \u03c6 and \u03c6 + \u03b5 can both be extended from V to the whole space X\nso that they belong to hf i. Hence f is not quasi-minimal.\nThe familiar operations of addition and multiplication on the set of real intervals is defined\nfor [a, a], [b, b] \u2208 I R as follows:\n[a, a] + [b, b] = {a + b : a \u2208 [a, a], b \u2208 [b, b]} = [a + b, a + b],\n[a, a]\u00d7[b, b] = {ab : a \u2208 [a, a], b \u2208 [b, b]} = [min{ab, ab, ab, ab}, max{ab, ab, ab, ab}],\nAmbiguities related to \u00b1\u221e are resolved in a way which guarantees inclusion:\n\u2212\u221e + (+\u221e) = [\u2212\u221e, +\u221e], 0 \u00d7 (+\u221e) = [0, +\u221e], 0 \u00d7 (\u2212\u221e) = [\u2212\u221e, 0]\nPoint-wise operations for interval functions are defined in the usual way:\n(f + g)(x) = f (x) + g(x) , (f \u00d7 g)(x) = f (x) \u00d7 g(x) , x \u2208 X.\n\n(3)\n\nIt is easy to see that the set of the S-continuous functions is closed under the above point-wise\noperations while the set of H-continuous functions is not. In earlier works by Markov, Sendov\nand the author, see [5]\u2013[8], it was shown that the algebraic operations on the set Hf t (X) of all\nfinite H-continuous function can be defined in such a way that it is a linear space (the largest\nlinear space of finite interval functions) and a ring. As mentioned above, these results were\nderived in the case when X is a Baire space. Here we extend these results in two ways:\n(i) We assume that the domain X is an arbitrary completely regular topological space.\n(ii) We consider the wider set Hnf of nearly finite H-continuous functions.\nThese generalizations are motivated by the aim of the paper: namely, constructing the\nrational extensions of C(X) as rings of functions defined on the same domain. More precisely, the\nproblem is considered in the same setting as in [14], that is, X a completely regular topological\nspace. Furthermore, it is shown in the sequel that the rational extensions of C(X) and their\nmetric completions considered in [14] cannot be all represented within the realm of finite Hcontinuous function. Hence we need to considered the larger set Hnf (X).\nLet us recall that an H-continuous function f is called nearly finite if the set\n\u0393f = {x \u2208 X : \u2212\u221e \u2208 f (x) or + \u221e \u2208 f (x)}\n\n\fis closed and nowhere dense. The set Hnf (X) has important applications in the Analysis of\nPDEs within the context of the Order Completion Method, [15]. It turns out that the solutions\nof large classes of systems of nonlinear PDEs can be assimilated with nearly finite H-continuous\nfunctions, see [10], [11]. The definition of the operations on Hnf (X) are based on the following\ntheorem.\nTheorem 2 For any f, g \u2208 Hnf (X) the functions f +g and f \u00d7g are quasi-minimal S-continuous\nfunctions.\nProof. The proofs for f + g and f \u00d7 g use similar ideas based on Theorem 1. We will\npresent only the proof for f \u00d7 g which is slightly more technical. Assume the opposite. In view\nof Theorem 1, this means that there exists \u03b5 > 0 and an open set V such that V \u2282 Wf \u00d7g,\u03b5 (f ).\nFurthermore, since f and g are nearly finite, the set V \\ (\u0393(f ) \u222a \u0393(g)) is also open and nonempty.\nLet a \u2208 V \\ (\u0393(f ) \u222a \u0393(g)). It is easy to see that the functions |f | defined by |f |(x) = |f (x)|,\nx \u2208 X, is an upper semi-continuous function. Therefore, there exists an open set D1 such that\na \u2208 D1 \u2282 V \\ (\u0393(f ) \u222a \u0393(g)) and |f (x)| < |f (a)| + 1, x \u2208 D1 . Similarly, there exists an open set\nD2 such that a \u2208 D2 \u2282 V \\ (\u0393(f ) \u222a \u0393(g)) and |g(x)| < |g(a)| + 1, x \u2208 D2 . Denote D = D1 \u2229 D2 .\nThen, using a well known inequality about the width of a product of intervals, see [1], for every\nx \u2208 D we obtain\n\u03b5 \u2264 w((f \u00d7 g)(x)) = w(f (x) \u00d7 g(x)) \u2264 w(f (x))|g(x)| + w(g(x))|f (x)|\n\u2264 w(f (x))(|g(a)| + 1) + w(g(x))(|f (a)| + 1) \u2264 (w(f (x)) + w(g(x))m,\nwhere m = max{|f (a)| + 1 , |g(a)| + 1}. This implies\n\u03b5 .\n\u03b5 \u222a W\nD \u2282 Wf, 2m\ng, 2m\n\u03b5 has a nonempty open subset. However, by\n\u03b5 and W\nTherefore, at least one of the sets Wf, 2m\ng, 2m\nTheorem 1 this is impossible. The obtained contradiction completes the proof.\nTheorem 2 implies that for every f, g \u2208 Hnf (X) the sets [f + g] and [f \u00d7 g] contain one\nelement each. Then we define addition and multiplication on Hnf (X) by\n\nf \u2295 g = [f + g]\n\n(4)\n\nf \u2297 g = [f \u00d7 g]\n\n(5)\n\nHere and in the sequel we denote the operations by \u2295 and \u2297 to distinguish them from the pointwise operations denoted earlier by + and \u00d7. Equivalently to (4)\u2013(5), one can say that f \u2295 g is\nthe unique H-continuous function contained in f + g and that f \u2297 g is the unique H-continuous\nfunction contained in f \u00d7 g. It should be noted that the operations \u2295 and \u2297 may coincide with\n+ and \u00d7 respectively for some values of the arguments. In particular,\nf \u2295 g = f + g, f \u2297 g = f \u00d7 g for f \u2208 C(X), g \u2208 Hnf (X).\n\n(6)\n\nTheorem 3 The set Hnf (X) is a commutative ring with respect to the operations \u2295 and \u2297.\nThe proof will be omitted. It involves standard techniques and is partially discussed in [7] for\nthe case of finite functions. The zero and the identity in Hnf (X) are the constant functions\nwith values 0 and 1 respectively. We will denote them by 0 and 1 with the context showing\nwhether we mean a constant function or the respective real number. The multiplicative inverse\n1\nof f \u2208 Hnf (X), whenever it exists, is denoted by . The non-zero-divisors in the ring Hnf (X)\nf\n\n\fcan be characterized similarly to the ring C(X). However, unlike C(X) all non-zero-divisors are\ninvertible. More precisely,\nf is a non-zero-divisor \u21d0\u21d2 Z(f ) is nowhere dense in X \u21d0\u21d2 \u2203g \u2208 Hnf (X) : f \u2297 g = 1\n\n(7)\n\nwhere Z(f ) is the zero set of the function f given by Z(f ) = {x \u2208 X : 0 \u2208 f (x)}. We denote\n1\nthe inverse of f , that is, the function g in (7) above, by . If f (x) = [f (x), f (x), x \u2208 X, then\nf\nwe have\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\n1\n1\n(x) =\n, x \u2208 coz(f ) = X \\ Z(f ).\n(8)\nf\nf (x) f (x)\nNote that in view of the property (1), the equality (8) determines\n\n1\nin a unique way because\nf\n\ncoz(f ) is dense in X.\nLet D be an open subset of X. The restriction f |D of f on D is an H-continuous function\non D, see [6]. More precisely,\nf \u2208 Hnf (X) =\u21d2 f |D \u2208 Hnf (D).\n\n(9)\n\nSince Hnf (D) is also a ring it is useful to remark that for any f, g \u2208 Hnf (X) we have\n(f \u2295 g)|D = f |D \u2295 g|D , (f \u2297 g)|D = f |D \u2297 g|D .\n\n(10)\n\nWe will also use the following property, [6]:\nfor any dense subset D of X and g \u2208 Hnf (D) there exists a unique\nfunction f \u2208 Hnf (X) such that f |D = g.\n\n3\n\n(11)\n\nRepresenting the Rational Extensions of C(X)\n\nThe zero set Z(f ) and the cozero set coz(f ) of f \u2208 Hnf (X) generalize the respective concepts\nfor continuous function and play an important role in the ring Hnf (X) as suggested by (7) and\n(8). This is further demonstrated in the following useful lemma which extends the respective\nresult in [14, Section 2.2].\nLemma 4 Let Ha (X) be a ring of H-continuous functions such that C(X) \u2286 Ha (X) \u2286 Hnf (X).\nAn ideal P of Ha (X) is rationally dense in Ha (X) if and only if coz(P ) is a dense subset of X.\nAny ideal P of a ring A is also an A-module. The rational completeness of a ring can be\ncharacterized in terms of the A-homomorphisms from the rationally dense ideals of A to A as\nshown in the next theorem [13].\nTheorem 5 A ring A is rationally complete if for every rationally dense ideal P of A and an\nA-homomorphism \u03c6 : P \u2192 A there exists s \u2208 P such that \u03c6(p) = sp, p \u2208 P .\nIn the sequel we refer to the A-homomorphism shortly as homomorphisms.\nTheorem 6 The ring Hnf (X) is rationally complete.\nProof. We use Theorem 5. Let P be an ideal of Hnf (X) and \u03c6 : P \u2192 Hnf (X) a homomorphism.\nLet p \u2208 P . Consider the ring Hnf (coz(p)). By (8), p is an invertible element of Hnf (coz(p)).\nSince \u03c6(p)|D \u2208 Hnf (coz(p)), see (9), we can consider the function \u03c8p = p1 \u2297\u03c6(p)|D \u2208 Hnf (coz(p)).\n\n\fNow we define the function \u03c8 \u2208 Hnf (X) in the following way. For any x \u2208 coz(P ) select\np \u2208 P such that 0 \u2208\n/ p(x). Then\n\u03c8(x) = \u03c8p (x)\nIt is easy to see that the definition does not depend on the function p. Indeed, let q \u2208 P be such\nthat 0 \u2208\n/ q(x). Since \u03c6 is a homomorphism we have\n\u03c6(p) \u2297 q = p \u2297 \u03c6(q).\n\n(12)\n\nDenote D = coz(p) \u2229 coz(q). Clearly D is an open neighborhood of x. Using (10) we have\n\u03c6(p)|D \u2297 q|D = p|D \u2297 \u03c6(q)|D ,\nwhich implies\n\n1\n1\n|D \u2297 \u03c6(p)|D = |D \u2297 \u03c6(q)|D .\np\nq\n\nTherefore \u03c6p (y) = \u03c6q (y), y \u2208 D. In particular, \u03c6p (x) = \u03c6q (x).\nNow \u03c8 is defined on coz(P ) and it is easy to see that \u03c8 \u2208 Hnf (coz(P )). Since coz(P ) is\ndense in X, see Lemma 4, using (11) the function \u03c8 can be defined on the rest of the set X in\na unique way so that \u03c8 \u2208 Hnf (X)).\nWe will show that \u03c6(p) = \u03c8 \u2297 p, p \u2208 P . Let p \u2208 P . We have\n\u0012 \u0013\n1\n|\n\u2297 \u03c6(p)|coz(p) \u2297 p|coz(p) = \u03c6(p)|coz(p)\n(\u03c8 \u2297 p)|coz(p) = (\u03c8p \u2297 p|coz(p) ) =\np coz(p)\nThen, using also (11), we obtain\n(\u03c8 \u2297 p)(x) = \u03c6(p)(x) , x \u2208 coz(p),\n\n(13)\n\nwhere coz(p) denotes the topological closure of the set coz(p). Applying standard techniques\nbased on the minimality property of H-continuous functions one can obtain that \u03c6(p)(x) = 0\nfor x \u2208 X \\ cos(p) \u2282 Z(p). Then we have\n\u03c6(p)(x) = 0 \u2208 \u03c8(x) \u00d7 p(x) , x \u2208 X \\ coz(p)\n\n(14)\n\nFrom (13) and (14) it follows\n\u03c6(p)(x) \u2286 \u03c8(x) \u00d7 p(x) , x \u2208 X.\n\n(15)\n\nBy the definition of the operation \u2297 the inclusion (15) implies \u03c6(p) = \u03c8 \u2297 p, which completes\nthe proof.\nThe rational completeness of Hnf (X) implies that any rational extension of any subring\nof Hnf (X)) is a subring of Hnf (X). In particular this applies to C(X), where the respective\nmaximal ring of quotients and classical ring of quotients are characterized in the next theorem.\nAs in the classical theory we call a subset V of X a zero set if there exists f \u2208 C(X) such that\nV = Z(f ).\nTheorem 7 (Representation Theorem) The ring of quotients and the classical ring of quotients of C(X) are the following subrings of Hnf (X)):\na) Q(C(X)) = Hnd (X) = {f \u2208 H(X) : Wf is nowhere dense}\nb) Qcl (C(X)) = Hsz (X) = {f \u2208 H(X) : Wf is a subset of a nowhere dense zero set}\n\n\fProof. a) First we need to show that Hnd (X) is a ring of quotients of C(X). In terms of\nthe definition we have to prove that for any \u03c6, \u03c8 \u2208 Hnd (X)), \u03c8 6= 0, there exists f \u2208 C(X)\nsuch that \u03c6 \u2297 f \u2208 C(X) and \u03c8 \u2297 f 6= 0. Since \u03c8 6= 0 the open set coz(\u03c8) is not empty.\nUsing that W\u03c6 and \u0393\u03c6 are closed nowhere dense sets we have coz(\u03c8) \\ (W\u03c6 \u222a \u0393\u03c6 ) 6= \u2205. Let\na \u2208 coz(\u03c8) \\ (W\u03c6 \u222a \u0393\u03c6 ). By the complete regularity of X: (i) there exists a neighborhood V of\nx such that V \u2282 coz(\u03c8) \\ (W\u03c6 \u2229 \u0393\u03c6 ); (ii) there exists a function f \u2208 C(X) such that f (a) = 1\nand f (x) = 0 for x \u2208 X \\ V . We have that \u03c8 \u00d7 f does not have zeros in a neighborhood of a,\nTherefore \u03c8 \u2297 f 6= 0. We prove next that \u03c6 \u2297 f \u2208 C(X). Indeed, \u03c6(x) \u00d7 f (x) = 0 for x in the\nopen set (X \\ V ) \\ (W\u03c6 \u222a \u0393\u03c6 ) which is dense in the open set X \\ V . Therefore (\u03c6 \u2297 f )|X\\V = 0,\nwhich implies (\u03c6 \u2297 f )|X\\V \u2208 C(X \\ V ). Obviously, (\u03c6 \u2297 f )|X\\(W\u03c6 \u222a\u0393\u03c6 ) \u2208 C(X \\ (W\u03c6 \u222a \u0393\u03c6 ). Hence,\n\u03c6 \u2297 f \u2208 C(X). Therefore, Hnd (X) is a ring of quotients of C(X). It is the maximal ring of\nquotients of C(X) if and only if it is rationally complete. The proof of the rational completeness\nof Hnd (X) is done in a similar way as for Hnf (X) and will be omitted.\nf\nb) Let f, g \u2208 C(X), Z(g) - nowhere dense in X. Then using (7) we obtain\n= f \u2297\ng\n1\nf\n\u2208 Hnf (X). Moreover, by (8) we have W f \u2286 Z(g) which implies\n\u2208 Hnd (X). Therefore\ng\ng\ng\nQcl (C(X)) \u2286 Hnd (X). Now we will prove the inverse inclusion. Let f \u2208 Hnd (X). Then there\nexists g \u2208 C(X) such that Z(g) is nowhere dense on X and Wf \u2286 Z(g). Consider the functions\n\u03c6 =\n\u03c8 =\n\nf \u2297g\n1+f \u2297f\ng\n.\n1+f \u2297f\n\nIt easy to see that |\u03c6| \u2264 |g| and |\u03c8| \u2264 |g|, which implies that \u0393\u03c6 = \u0393\u03c8 = \u2205. Furthermore,\nsince \u03c6(x) = \u03c8(x) = 0 for all x \u2208 Wf we have W\u03c6 = W\u03c8 = \u2205. Hence, \u03c6, \u03c8 \u2208 C(X). Since\nZ(\u03c8) = Z(g) is nowhere dense in X, the function \u03c8 is an invertible element of Hnd (X). Then\n\u03c6\nf = \u2208 Qcl (C(X)), which completes the proof.\n\u03c8\n\n4\n\nRepresenting the metric completions of Q(C(X)) and Qcl (C(X))\n\nThe metric \u03c1 on C(X) given in (2) can be extended to Hnf (X) as follows\n\u03c1(f, g) =\n\n|f \u2296 g|\n,\nx\u2208X\\(\u0393f \u222a\u0393g ) 1 + |f \u2296 g|\nsup\n\n(16)\n\nwhere f \u2296 g = f \u2295 (\u22121)g.\nTheorem 8 The set Hnf (X) is a complete metric space with respect to the metric \u03c1 in (16).\nProof. Verifying that \u03c1 satisfies the axioms of a metric uses standard techniques and will be\nomitted. We will prove the completeness by using that Hnf (X) is a Dedekind complete latticet\nwith respect to the usual point-wise order, see [10, 11]. Furthermore, Hnf (X) is also a vector\nlattice with respect to the addition \u2295 and the multiplication by constants. This can be shown\nsimilarly to [12], where the case of finite H-continuous functions is considered. The following\nimplication for any \u03b5 \u2208 (0, 1) is easy to obtain and is useful in the proof\n\u03c1(f, g) < \u03b5 \u21d0\u21d2\n\n\u03b5\n\u03b5\n\u03b5\n\u2212\u03b5\n\u2264f \u2296g \u2264\n\u21d0\u21d2 g \u2296\n\u2264f \u2264g\u2295\n.\n1\u2212\u03b5\n1\u2212\u03b5\n1\u2212\u03b5\n1\u2212\u03b5\n\n(17)\n\n\fLet (f\u03bb )\u03bb\u2208\u039b be a Cauchy net on Hnf (X). There exists \u03bc \u2208 \u039b such that \u03c1(f\u03bb , f\u03bc ) < 0.5. Then\nby (17) the net (f\u03bb )\u03bb\u2265\u03bc is bounded. Due to the Dedekind order completeness of Hnf (X) the\nfollowing infima and suprema exist\n\u03c6\u03bb = inf{f\u03bd : \u03bd \u2265 \u03bb} , \u03bb \u2265 \u03bc,\n\u03c8\u03bb = sup{f\u03bd : \u03bd \u2265 \u03bb} , \u03bb \u2265 \u03bc,\n\u03c6 = sup{\u03c6\u03bb : \u03bb \u2265 \u03bc}\n\u03c8 = inf{\u03c8\u03bb : \u03bb \u2265 \u03bc}\nLet \u03b5 \u2208 (0, 1). There exists \u03bb\u03b5 such that \u03c1(f\u03bb , f\u03bd ) < \u03b5, \u03bb, \u03bd \u2265 \u03bb\u03b5 . It follows from (17) that\nf\u03bb\u03b5 \u2296\nTherefore,\nf\u03bb\u03b5 \u2296\n\n\u03b5\n\u03b5\n\u2264 f\u03bd \u2264 f\u03bb\u03b5 \u2295\n, \u03bd \u2265 \u03bb\u03b5 .\n1\u2212\u03b5\n1\u2212\u03b5\n\n\u03b5\n\u03b5\n\u2264 \u03c6\u03bb \u2264 \u03c8\u03bb \u2264 f\u03bb\u03b5 \u2295\n, \u03bb \u2265 \u03bb\u03b5 ,\n1\u2212\u03b5\n1\u2212\u03b5\n\nwhich implies\n\n2\u03b5\n, \u03bb \u2265 \u03bb\u03b5 .\n1\u2212\u03b5\nTaking a supremum on \u03bb and considering that \u03b5 is arbitrary we obtain \u03c6 = \u03c8.\nFurther, from the inequalities\n0 \u2264 \u03c8\u03bb \u2296 \u03c6\u03bb \u2264\n\n(18)\n\n\u03c6\u03bb \u2264 f\u03bb \u2264 \u03c8\u03bb\n\u03c6\u03bb \u2264 \u03c6 \u2264 \u03c8\u03bb\nand (18) we obtain\n|f\u03bb \u2296 \u03c6| \u2264 |\u03c8\u03bb \u2296 \u03c6\u03bb | \u2264\n\n2\u03b5\n, \u03bb \u2265 \u03bb\u03b5 .\n1\u2212\u03b5\n\nor equivalently \u03c1(f\u03bb , \u03c6) < \u03b5. This implies that lim f\u03bb = \u03c6, which completes the proof.\n\u03bb\n\nSince the ring Hnf (X) is rationally complete, see Theorem 6, as well as complete with respect\nto the metric (16), see Theorem 8, it contains all rings of quotients of C(X) as well as their\nmetric completions. In particular, representation of the metric completion Q(C(X)) of Q(C(X))\nis given in the next theorem.\nTheorem 9 The completion of the ring of quotients of C(X) is Hnf (X)), that is,\nQ(C(X)) = Hnf (X)\nProof. Since the completeness of Hnf (X)) has already been proved, we only need to show\nthat Q(C(X)) is dense in Hnf (X). Using the representation of Q(C(X)) given in Theorem 7,\nequivalently, we need to show that Hnd (X) is dense in Hnf (X)). Let f = [f , f ] \u2208 Hnf (X) and\nlet n \u2208 N. We have\n1\n1\nf (x) \u2212 \u2264 f (x) + , x \u2208 X \\ (Wf, 1 \u222a \u0393f ).\n(19)\nn\nn\nn\nSince the function on the left side of the inequality (19) is upper semi-continuous while the\nfunction on the right side is lower semi-continuous by the well known Theorem of Han there\nexists fn \u2208 C(X \\ (Wf, 1 \u2229 \u0393f )) such that\nn\n\nf (x) \u2212\n\n1\n1\n\u2264 fn (x) \u2264 f (x) + , x \u2208 X \\ (Wf, 1 \u222a \u0393f ).\nn\nn\nn\n\n(20)\n\n\fThe set X \\ (Wf, 1 \u222a \u0393f ) is an open and dense subset of X because Wf, 1 and \u0393f are closed\nn\nn\nnowhere dense sets. Hence fn can be extended in a unique way to X so that it is H-continuous\non X. Since this extended function may assume interval values or values involving \u00b1\u221e only on\nthe closed nowhere dense set Wf, 1 \u222a \u0393f we have fn \u2208 Hnd (X). Moreover, it follows from the\nn\ninequality (20) that\n1\n\u03c1(f, fn ) \u2264\nsup\n|f \u2296 fn | \u2264 .\nn\nx\u2208X\\(W 1 \u222a\u0393f )\nf, n\n\nHence, lim fn = f . Therefore Hnd (X) is dense in Hnf (X).\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n5\n\nConclusion\n\nThis paper gives an application of a class of interval functions, namely, the Hausdorff continuous function, to the representation of the rational extensions of C(X) as well as their metric\ncompletions. Traditionally, Interval Analysis is considered as part of Numerical Analysis due\nto its major applications to scientific computing. However, the study of the order, topological\nand algebraic structure of the spaces of interval functions led to some significant applications\nto other areas of mathematics, e.g. Approximation Theory [16], Analysis of PDEs [10, 11, 17],\nReal Analysis [2, 12]. The results presented here are in the same line of applications. It is shown\nthat all rings of quotients of C(X) and their matric completions are subrings of the ring Hnf (X)\nof nearly finite Hausdorff continuous functions. Thus, Hnf (X)) is the largest set of functions to\nwhich the ring and metric structure of C(X) can be extended in an unambiguous way.\n\nReferences\n[1] Alefeld G, Herzberger J, Introduction to Interval Computations, Academic Press, NY,1983.\n[2] Anguelov, R., Dedekind order completion of C(X) by Hausdorff continuous functions.
