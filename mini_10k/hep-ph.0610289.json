Within the accepted QCD\nframework the large-Nc analysis under the assumption\nof confinement [2, 3] supports many aspects of this view.\nMoreover, the identification of the topological winding\nnumber as the conserved baryon number of quarks from\nthe occupied Dirac sea in the background of large and\nspatially extended pion fields [4] suggested the underlying necessary fermionic nature of the soliton at least\nfor odd Nc [5]. The form of the Lagrangean remains\nunspecified besides the requirement of chiral symmetry,\nleaving much freedom on the assumed meson-field dynamics needed for practical computations of low-energy\nbaryonic properties [6, 7], usually organized in terms of\na finite number of bosons of increasing mass. One appealing feature of the Skyrme model (for reviews see e.g.\n[8, 9, 10, 11]) is that confinement appears to be explicitly\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: earriola@ugr.es\naddress: Wojciech.Broniowski@ifj.edu.pl\n\u2021 Electronic address: bojan.golli@ijs.si\n\u2020 Electronic\n\nincorporated, since the baryon number topology of the\nmeson fields cannot be changed with a finite amount of\nenergy and the soliton is absolutely stable against decay\ninto free quarks. This has also made possible the study of\nexcited baryons (see e.g. Ref. [12] and references therein).\nHowever, when the partonic content of the baryon is analyzed in deep inelastic scattering, in the Skyrme model\nthe Callan-Gross relation is violated, hence the partons\nturn out not to be spin one-half objects [13]. Therefore,\nmaking credible non-perturbative estimates of high energy properties is out of reach of the standard Skyrme\nmodel. This also suggests that the relevant degrees of\nfreedom should explicitly include constituent quarks chirally coupled to mesons [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]\nmotivating the use of chiral quark models with quarks\nand to search for solitonic solutions to describe baryons.\nThe approach is very much in the spirit of the Skyrme\nmodel but with the important feature that the partonic\ninterpretation corresponds to spin one-half constituents,\ndespite the subtleties of the regularization [23]. The considerable effort exerted to describe low-lying baryons as\nsolitons of effective chiral quark models has been described in detail in the reviews [24, 25, 26, 27, 28].\nThe chiral quark models that arise naturally in several approaches to low-energy quark dynamics, such as\nthe instanton-liquid model [29] or the Schwinger-Dyson\nresummation of rainbow diagrams [30], are nonlocal, i.e.\nthe quark mass function depends on the quark virtual-\n\n\f2\nity. For the derivations and applications of these models\nsee, e.g., [31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42,\n43, 44, 45, 46, 47]. A major success was the finding\nof baryon hedgehog solitons in nonlocal models [48, 49],\nwhich turn out to be stable also in the linear version\nof the model. Moreover, the nonlocal models have nice\nfeatures as compared to the local variants, in particular they use a uniform regularization of both the normal\nand abnormal parity processes, thus reproducing properly the anomalies in the presence of regularization. In\naddition, the theory is made finite to all orders of perturbation theory. The price to pay for the non-locality is a\ncomplicated nature of interaction vertices with currents,\nwhere the gauge invariance imposes non-local contributions. Their presence leads to technical complications in\nthe treatment of non-local models.\nA relevant issue for chiral quark solitons is related to\nthe confinement and stability of the mean field solution.\nThe chiral quark soliton model builds baryons as bound\nstates of valence constituent quarks in non-trivial meson fields. Indeed, such a model interpolates between\nthe non-relativistic quark model and the Skyrme model\nin the limit of small solitons and large solitons, respectively [50]. As a matter of fact, from the view point of\nthe chiral quark model, the apparent confinement in the\nSkyrme model is reinterpreted as a strong binding effect,\nand indeed deeply bound states are not sensitive to the\nconfinement properties of the interaction. Nevertheless,\nit is notorious that depending on the details, the mean\nfield soliton may in fact decay into three free constituent\nquarks. Moreover, in local models for small enough solitons the valence state becomes an unbound free quark at\nrest. Actually, to our knowledge there is no satisfactory\ncalculation of excited baryon states in the chiral quark\nsoliton model precisely because of the lack of confinement [51]. These features happen for realistic parameter\nvalues and despite the alleged compatibility of the chiral\nquark model with the large-Nc limit. As already mentioned the soliton description of baryons in the large-Nc\nlimit is based on the assumption of confinement.\nLet us define the scope of the present work. After\nthe many years, the issue of color confinement remains\na crucial and intriguing subject for which no obvious solution exists yet. In particular, its realization implies\ntwo relevant consequences. In the first place, there exists a spectrum of color singlet excited states. Secondly,\nquarks cannot become on shell and hence quark propagators merely cannot have poles on the real axis. This\nrestrained meaning of confinement is often called analytic confinement in the literature and in that sense is\nadopted in the present work. We hasten to emphasize\nthat although our work obviously does not suggest how\nthe problem of color confinement might be resolved, we\nmanage to set up a framework where the calculation of\ncolor singlet states such as excited baryons becomes possible as a matter of principle within a chiral quark soliton\napproach.\nIn this paper we show how a recently proposed ver-\n\nsion of the chiral quark model, the Spectral Quark Model\n(SQM) [52, 53, 54, 55] (see also [56] for the original insights on the spectral problem), not only allows for solitonic solutions but due to its unconventional and indeed\nremarkable analytic properties yields a valence eigenvalue which never becomes unbound. Thus the soliton\nis absolutely stable. The model is based on a generalized Lehmann representation where the spectral function is generically complex, involving a continuous superposition of complex masses. The subject of defining\na well founded quantum field theory of fixed complex\nmasses is an old story [57, 58, 59, 60, 61]. Our approach differs from these works, since our complex mass\nis an integration variable so that many standard objections are sidestepped by choosing an appropriate integration contour. In practical terms the spectral function\nacts as a finite regulator fulfilling suitable spectral conditions but with many desirable properties, in particular the simple implementation of chiral symmetry and\ngauge invariance. One of its outstanding features is the\nuniform treatment of normal and abnormal parity processes ensuring both finiteness of the action and a simultaneous implementation of the correctly normalized\nWess-Zumino-Witten term1 . This uniform treatment of\nregularization has some impact on soliton calculations\neven in the SU(2) case (where the Wess-Zumino-Witten\nterm vanishes) since the valence and sea contributions\nto the soliton energy are indeed related to the abnormal\nand normal parity separation of the effective action, respectively. The basics of SQM are described in detail in\n[53, 55] and the reader is referred there for the description of the method and numerous applications to the pion\nphenomenology. The SQM approach bares similarities to\nnonlocal models, however the construction of interaction\nvertices with currents is very simple in SQM, as opposed\nto almost prohibitive complications of the nonlocal approach.\nThe purpose of this paper is twofold: Firstly, we show\nthat absolutely stable baryon solitons in SQM exist and\ndiscuss their properties. Secondly and more generally, we\nstudy an instance of an involved complex-mass system,\nand show how to treat valence states. Despite the complexity, the resulting prescription turns out to be very\nsimple and easy to implement in practical calculations.\nIt amounts to locating the saddles of the valence eigenvalue, \u01eb0 , as a function of the complex mass \u03c9, based on\nthe condition\nd\u01eb0 (\u03c9)\n= 0.\nd\u03c9\n\n(1)\n\nThe outline of our paper is as follows: In Sect. II we\nprovide an operational justification of the need of some\n\n1\n\nIn the standard treatment of local models the somewhat artificial\nand certainly asymmetric prescription of regularizing the real\npart of the Euclidean action and not regularizing the imaginary\npart has been used.\n\n\f3\nuniform regularization for the full action without an explicit separation between normal and abnormal parity\ncontributions. Certain a priori field-theoretic consistency\nconditions are discussed. SQM is shown to fulfill the\none-body consistency condition in contrast to previous\nlocal versions of chiral quark models. We also discuss\nin some detail the analytic structure of the meson correlators, showing that despite analytically-confined quarks\nthey possess cuts at large values of q 2 , as requested by\n(asymptotic) quark unitarity. However, the meromorphic structure expected from general large Nc considerations is violated. This point is analyzed in the light of\na large-Nc Regge model. Next, we pass to the analysis of solitons. First, we discuss the connection between\nthe baryon and topological currents in the limit of large\nsolitons, which holds in the presence of the spectral regularization. Following the standard field-theoretic approach the construction of the baryon state is pursued\nin Sect. III. The unconventional appearance of complexmasses requires a demanding mathematical treatment of\nboth the valence and sea contributions. Nevertheless,\nready-to-use formulas for the total soliton mass are derived and analyzed for several soliton profiles showing the\nexistence of chiral solitons with baryon number one. An\nalternative derivation is provided in Appendix E based\non computing the spectral integral exactly. Dealing with\ncomplex mass Dirac operators both for bound states and\ncontinuum states is involved and some of the features\nmay be studied in a somewhat comprehensive toy model\nin Appendix D. The techniques are close to the more\nfamiliar complex potentials in non-relativistic quantum\nmechanics which are reviewed for completeness in Appendix C. In Appendix G we show that a linear extension\nof SQM leads to instability of the vacuum, hence SQM\ncan only be constructed in the originally proposed nonlinear realization. In Sect. IV we look for self-consistent\nhedgehog solutions and determine their properties both\nin the chiral limit as well as for finite pion masses. Finally, in Sect. V we come to the conclusions.\n\nII.\n\nTHE SPECTRAL QUARK MODEL AND\nCONSISTENCY RELATIONS\n\nWe begin with some basic expressions of the general\nfield-theoretic treatment of chiral quark models, which\nare the groundwork for our treatment of solitons and the\nmethod of including valence states in SQM discussed in\nSect. III. In this section we highlight an important consistency condition which was not fulfilled in the hitherto\nextensively used chiral quark soliton models based on\nlocal interactions. Remarkably, this condition happens\nto be satisfied in SQM. The analytic properties of the\nquark propagator and in particular the lack of poles are\nreviewed. We also analyze some important aspects of the\nmeson sector, and in particular the analytic structure of\ntwo-point correlators in the complex q 2 -plane. Finally,\nwe show how the correct topological current arises in the\n\npresence of regularization.\nA.\n\nA consistency condition\n\nThe vacuum-to-vacuum transition amplitude in the\npresence of external bosonic (s, p, v, a) and fermionic\n(\u03b7, \u03b7\u0304) fields of a chiral quark model Lagrangian can be\nwritten in the path-integral form as\nn Z\nh\nio\nZ[j, \u03b7, \u03b7\u0304] = h0|T exp i d4 x q\u0304jq + \u03b7\u0304q + q\u0304\u03b7 |0i, (2)\nwhere the compact notation\n\nj = /v + a\n/\u03b35 \u2212 (s + i\u03b35 p)\n\n(3)\n\nhas been introduced. The symbols s, p, v\u03bc , and a\u03bc denote\nthe external scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, and axial flavor\nsources, respectively, given in terms of the generators of\nthe flavor SU (3) group,\ns=\n\n2\nNF\n\u22121\n\nX\n\nsa\n\na=0\n\n\u03bba\n,\n2\n\n...\n\n(4)\n\nwith \u03bba representing the Gell-Mann matrices. Any physical matrix element can be computed by functional differentiation with respect to the external sources.\nLet us consider the calculation of a bilinear quark operator, such as, e.g., the quark condensate (for a single\nflavor) hq\u0304qi. We can think of two possible ways of making such a computation, namely via coupling of an external scalar source s(x) (a mass term) and differentiating\nwith respect to s(x), or by calculating the second functional derivative with respect to the Grassmann external\nsources \u03b7(x) and \u03b7\u0304(x) taken at the same spatial point.\nThe consistency of the calculation requires the following\ntrivial identity for the generating functional:\nhq\u0304(x)q(x)i = i\n\n1 \u03b4Z\nZ \u03b4s(x)\n\n0\n\n= lim\nhq\u0304(x\u2032 )q(x)i = lim\n(\u2212i)2\n\u2032\n\u2032\nx \u2192x\n\nx \u2192x\n\n\u03b42Z\n1\n, (5)\nZ \u03b4\u03b7(x)\u03b7\u0304(x\u2032 ) 0\n\nwhere |0 means all external sources set to zero. This requirement can be generalized to any quark bilinear with\nany bosonic quantum numbers and thus we call it the\none-body consistency condition. In the traditional treatment of local chiral quark models the l.h.s. of the above\nformula corresponds to a closed quark line and is divergent, calling for regularization, whereas for x\u2032 6= x the\nr.h.s. is finite and corresponds to an open quark line, thus\nno regularization is demanded. This poses a consistency\nproblem which actually becomes crucial in the analysis\nof high-energy processes and introduces an ambiguity in\nthe partonic interpretation as well as conflicts with gauge\ninvariance and energy-momentum conservation (see, e.g.,\nRef. [62] for a further discussion on these subtle but relevant issues). Obviously, the previous argument could\n\n\f4\nequally be applied to sources with any quantum numbers suggesting that any consistent regularization should\nbe applied to the full action. As already mentioned in the\nIntroduction, in the traditional approach to local models the treatment of singularities requires first to separate the normal and abnormal parity contributions and\nto regularize only the normal parity piece. In the Euclidean space this separation corresponds to the real and\nimaginary parts of the action.\nIn the next section we show that SQM fulfills the\none-body consistency condition. More generally, one\nmight want to extend the condition (5) to any number of\nquark bilinears contracted to bosonic quantum numbers,\nnamely the N \u2212body consistency condition\nhq\u0304(x1 )\u03931 q(x1 ) * * * q\u0304(xN )\u03931 q(xN )i\n= \u2032lim hq\u0304(x\u20321 )\u03931 q(x1 ) * * * q\u0304(x\u2032N )\u03931 q(xN )i\nxi \u2192xi\n\nThe Spectral Quark Model and the quark\npropagator\n\nIn SQM the regularization is imposed already at the\nlevel of one open line through the use of a generalized\nLehmann representation for the full quark propagator in\nthe absence of external sources,\nZ\n\u03c1(\u03c9)\nS(/\np) =\nd\u03c9\n= /pA(p2 ) + B(p2 )\n(7)\np\n/\n\u2212\n\u03c9\nC\nwhere C is a suitable contour in the complex massplane [54] (see also Fig. 1 below). Chiral and electromagnetic gauge invariance can be taken care of through the\nuse of the gauge technique of Delbourgo and West [63,\n64], which provide particular solutions to chiral WardTakahashi identities, or through the use the standard\neffective action approach, applied in this paper. As a\nresult, one can \"open the quark line\" from one closed\nloop and compute high-energy processes with a partonic\ninterpretation, such as, e.g., the structure function and\nthe light-cone wave function of the pion, etc. [54], or the\nphoton and \u03c1-meson light cone wave functions [65]. The\ngeneralization of the (one body) consistency condition\nfor scalar sources, Eq. (5), to all possible bosonic quantum numbers can be achieved by taking the generating\nfunctional to be\nZ\nZ[\u03b7, \u03b7\u0304, s, p, . . .] = DU e\u2212ih\u03b7\u0304,S[U,s,p,v,a]\u03b7i ei\u0393[U,s,p,v,a] , (8)\nwhere the quark propagator and the effective action are\ngiven by\nZ\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nhx |S[U, s, p, v, a]aa |xi =\nd\u03c9\u03c1(\u03c9)hx|(D)\u22121\naa\u2032 |x i, (9)\nC\n\n\u0393[U, s, p, v, a] = \u2212iNc\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c9\u03c1(\u03c9)Tr log (iD) ,\n\n(10)\n\nC\n\nrespectively. The Dirac operator has the form\n\u0001\niD = i/\n\u2202 \u2212 \u03c9U 5 \u2212 m\u03020 + v/ + a\n/\u03b35 \u2212 s \u2212 i\u03b3 5 p .\n\nFor a bilocal (Dirac- and flavor-matrix valued) operator\nA(x, x\u2032 ) we use the notation\nZ\nTrA = d4 x trhA(x, x)i,\n(11)\nwith tr denoting the Dirac trace and h i the flavor trace.\nThe matrix\n\u221a\n\nU 5 = ei\u03b35 2\u03a6/f\n1\n1\n= (1 + \u03b35 )U + (1 \u2212 \u03b35 )U \u2020 ,\n2\n2\n\n(6)\n\nwhere the l.h.s. is evaluated after functional derivatives\nwith respect to bosonic sources and the r.h.s. with respect to fermionic sources respectively. Here \u0393i are general spin-flavor matrices. We have found that this is\nnot possible in the SQM scheme (see the discussion in\nSect. II B below).\nB.\n\nand\n\n(12)\n\n\u221a\ni 2\u03a6/f\n\nis the flavor matrix representing\nwhile U = u2 = e\nthe pseudoscalar octet of mesons in the nonlinear representation,\n\uf8eb 1 0\n\uf8f6\n\u221a \u03c0 + \u221a1 \u03b7\n\u03c0+\nK+\n2\n6\n\uf8ec\nK0 \uf8f7\n\u03c0\u2212\n\u2212 \u221a12 \u03c0 0 + \u221a16 \u03b7\n\u03a6=\uf8ed\n\uf8f8 .

For\n\u221a a\ntwo-flavor model it is enough to consider \u03a6 = ~\u03c4 * ~\u03c0 / 2.\nIn Eq. (8) the Dirac operator appears both in the\nfermion determinant as well as in the quark propagator\nand could, in principle, be treated independently. The\none-body consistency condition is fulfilled precisely because we use the same spectral function \u03c1(\u03c9) for both.\nWe have refrained on purpose from writing a Lagrangean\nin terms of quarks explicitly since anyhow chiral quark\nmodels are defined in conjunction with the regularization\nand the approximation used. In our case we work in the\nleading order of the large-Nc expansion, which amounts\nto a saddle point approximation in the bosonic U -fields\nand use the spectral regularization which is most explicitly displayed in terms of the generating functional presented above. The new ingredient of SQM compared to\nearlier chiral quark models is the presence of the quark\nspectral function \u03c1(\u03c9) in Eq. (9,10) and the integration\nover \u03c9 along a suitably chosen contour C in the complex\u03c9 plane. Our approach extends the early model of Efimov and Ivanov [56] by including the gauge invariance,\nthe chiral symmetry, and the vector meson dominance, as\nwell as applying the model to both low- and high-energy\nprocesses.\nThe above SQM construction implements the one-body\nconsistency condition, as follows\ni\n\n\u03b4Z\n\u03b4j\u03b1 (x)\n\n\u03b7=\u03b7\u0304=0\n\n= lim\n(\u2212i)2\n\u2032\nx \u2192x\n\n\u03b4\n\u03b4\n\u0393\u03b1\nZ\n\u03b4\u03b7(x) \u03b7\u0304(x\u2032 )\n\n\u03b7=\u03b7\u0304=0\n\n,\n(14)\n\n\f5\nwhich is more general than Eq. (5) since it is valid in the\npresence of non-vanishing external bosonic sources with\nany quantum numbers and non-trivial background pion\nfield, U . This represents a clear improvement on the previous local chiral quark models where this requirement\nwas violated. Eq. (14) has direct applicability on the\nsoliton sector as we will discuss in Sect. III. It should be\nmentioned, however, that similarly to many other chiral\nquark models, the two-body and higher consistency conditions, Eq. (6) are not satisfied in SQM. For instance,\nfor the two body consistency condition one gets\nZ\nZ\n1\nhq\u0304(x1 )\u03931 q(x1 )q\u0304(x2 )\u03932 q(x2 )i =\nDU d\u03c9\u03c1(\u03c9)\nZ\n\u0002\n\u0003 \u0002\n\u0003\n\u00d7 tr \u03931 hx1 |D\u22121 (\u03c9)|x1 i tr \u03932 hx2 |D\u22121 (\u03c9)|x2 i ,\n(15)\n\nwhile observables are related to the log-moments and inverse moments of \u03c1(\u03c9) [53]. The full spectral function\nconsists of two parts of different parity under the change\n\u03c9 \u2192 \u2212\u03c9, i.e. \u03c1(\u03c9) = \u03c1V (\u03c9) + \u03c1S (\u03c9), with the scalar\npart, \u03c1S , even and the vector part, \u03c1V , odd. A particular implementation of SQM is the meson dominance\nmodel, where one requests that the large-Nc pion electromagnetic form factor has the monopole form of the\nvector-meson dominance (VMD),\nF\u03c0 (q 2 ) =\n\n1\n= \u2032lim\nlim\nxi \u2192xi Z\nx\u2032i \u2192xi\nZ\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u00d7\nd\u03c91 \u03c1(\u03c91 )tr \u03931 hx\u20321 |D\u22121 (\u03c91 )|x1 i\nZ\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u00d7\nd\u03c92 \u03c1(\u03c92 )tr \u03932 hx\u20321 |D\u22121 (\u03c92 )|x1 i\n6= hq\u0304(x1 )\u03931 q(x1 )q\u0304(x2 )\u03932 q(x2 )i .\n\nZ\n\n\u03c1V (\u03c9) =\nDU\n\n1\n1 1\n,\n2\u03c0i \u03c9 (1 \u2212 4\u03c9 2 /MV2 )5/2\n\n(19)\n\nwith the pole at the origin and cuts starting at \u00b1MV /2,\nwhere MV is the mass of the vector meson. Similar considerations for the photon light-cone wave function [65]\nand matching to VMD yield for the scalar part an analogous form,\n(16)\n\nLikewise, we do not know if this one body consistency\ncondition is fulfilled beyond the leading large-Nc approximation. At present the only known way to fulfill all\nconsistency conditions is by returning to nonlocal versions of the chiral quark model. Therefore, we must provide a prescription of how higher functional derivatives\nshould be handled in case were more than a single quark\nline could be opened. Eq. (14) suggests to use always\nthe method based on the bosonic sources for operators\ninvolving any number of quark bilinear and local operators. For operators involving one single bilocal and bilinear operator q(x)q\u0304(x\u2032 ) we may use the method based\non fermionic sources, since Eq. (14) guarantees the consistency in the coincidence limit x\u2032 \u2192 x. Of course, this\nprescription does not yield a unique result when more\nthen one bilocal and bilinear quark operator is involved\nor equivalently when more than one quark line is opened.\nUsing the standard variational differentiation for the\ngenerating functional the Feynman rules for SQM follow\nfrom the action (10). They have the form of the usual\nFeynman rules for a local theory, amended with the spectral integration associated to each quark line, according\nto Eq. (10). This resembles very much the well known\nPauli-Villars regularization method (however with a continuous superposition of complex masses) and allows for\nvery efficient computations, see [52, 53, 54, 55].\nThe basic paper [53] explains the general construction\nand the conditions for the moments of the spectral function \u03c1(\u03c9) coming from physics constraints. In particular,\nnormalization requires\nZ\nd\u03c9\u03c1(\u03c9) = 1,\n(17)\nC\n\n(18)\n\nwhere MV denotes the \u03c1-meson mass.2 The matching\nof the model predictions to this form yields the rather\nunusual spectral function\n\nwhile\nhq\u0304(x1 )\u03931 q(x\u20321 )q\u0304(x2 )\u03932 q(x\u20322 )i\n\nMV2\n,\nMV2 \u2212 q 2\n\n\u03c1S (\u03c9) = \u2212\n\n48\u03c0 2 hq\u0304qi\n1\n.\n4\n2\u03c0i Nc MS (1 \u2212 4\u03c9 2 /MS2 )5/2\n\n(20)\n\nwhere hq\u0304qi is the single flavor quark condensate, and\nMS = MV [55]. The contour C for the \u03c9 integration\nto be used with formulas (19,20) is shown in Fig. 1 for\n\u03c1V (for \u03c1S one has the same contour with MV \u2192 MS ).\nThis contour is applicable in the vacuum (i.e., no baryon\nnumber) sector of the model. The extension to baryons\nis described in the next section. From Eq. (19) and (20)\none gets the quark propagator functions from Eq.

In the standard constant mass case the pion form\nfactor, a three point function, due to Cutkosky's rules, displays\na cut in the form factor for sufficiently large energy due to a\nsuperposition of poles in the quark propagator. In SQM the\nmechanism is just the opposite; the cuts conspire to build a pole\nin the form factor.\n\n\f6\nw\u2212Complex Plane\n\nand quantitative level compares favorably to the nonlocal quark models and to the lattice calculations [68].\nAs a sample calculation, we extend in the next subsections the previous considerations to the calculation of\nvacuum properties and two-point correlators.\n\nx\n\u2212Mv / 2\n\nMv / 2\n\nFIG. 1: The contour C in the complex-\u03c9 plane for the calculations in the vacuum sector in the meson dominance variant\nof SQM.

Actually,\nthe \u03c9-integral can be evaluated using the integral transformations displayed in the first lines of Eqs. (21). For\ninstance, taking the limit p2 \u2192 \u221e one gets the moments\nZ\nd\u03c9 \u03c1V (\u03c9)\u03c9 2k\n, k = 0, 1, 2, . . .

(23)\n0 =\nC\n\nwhich imply in particular the vanishing of all positive\nmoments for the spectral function \u03c1(\u03c9).\nThe pion weak-decay constant in the chiral limit comes\nout to be [53]\nNc MV2\n,\n(24)\n24\u03c0 2\na relation which works well phenomenologically. This\nrelation will be used as an identity in the rest of the\npaper. Compared to the standard field-theoretic case,\neach Rquark line is supplemented with a spectral integration C d\u03c9\u03c1(\u03c9). This makes calculations very straightforward and practical for numerous hadronic processes\ninvolving mesons and photons. We stress that despite a\nrather \"exotic\" appearance of the quark spectral function, SQM leads to proper phenomenology for the soft\npion, including the Gasser-Leutwyler coefficients [55], the\nsoft matrix elements for hard processes, such as the distribution amplitude, transition form factor, or structure\nfunctions [53], the generalized forward parton distribution of the pion [67], the photon distribution amplitude\nand light-cone wave functions [65], or the pion-photon\ntransition distribution amplitude [66]. In addition, the\ncalculations are straightforward, leading to simple analytic results. Interestingly, the quark propagator corresponding to (19,20) has no poles, only cuts, in the\nmomentum space. The evaluated mass function of the\nquark, M (Q2 ), displays a typical dependence on the virtuality Q2 in the Euclidean region and at the qualitative\n\nC.\n\nThe vacuum sector\n\nAs mentioned above the functional (one-body) consistency conditions guarantee the unambiguous calculation\nof observables obtained from quark fields, either as double Grassmann functional derivatives or as single bosonic\nones. These identities are generically formally satisfied\nbut become tricky under regularization. Here we use the\nfirst possibility for the quark condensate and the vacuum\nenergy density. The second method based on the effective action and yielding identical results is outlined in\nAppendix A.\nThe (single flavor) quark condensate hq\u0304qi can directly\nbe computed from the quark propagator\nZ\nd4 p\nNf hq\u0304qi = \u2212iNc\nTrS(/\np)\n(2\u03c0)4\nZ\nd4 p\n1\nB(p2 ),\n(25)\n= 4Nc Nf\ni\n(2\u03c0)4\nwhich through the use of Eq.

(24)), as one might expect for the chirally\nsymmetric broken phase.\nD.\n\nTwo-point correlators in the meson sector\n\nIn SQM the quark propagator has no poles but cuts\nat p2 = MV2 /4 preventing the occurrence of quarks on\n\n\f7\nthe mass shell. This complies to the notion of analytic\nconfinement, a necessary but certainly not sufficient condition for color confinement. This non-standard behavior\nalready suggests a possible departure from the standard\ntreatment. However, to justify the claim of confinement\none should check, in addition, the absence of cuts in physical correlators. Note that this question is in principle\nunrelated to the analytic confinement of bound quarks\nin a soliton with baryon number one which will be discussed in further sections below, but it is still interesting\nto see the analytic properties of the model. We analyze\nthis issue below in some detail for the two-point mesonic\ncorrelators defined as\nZ\n\u03a0AB (q) = i d4 xe\u2212iq*x h0|T {JA (x)JB (0)} |0i, (28)\n\nwhere JA (x) and JB (x) are interpolating currents with\nthe relevant meson quantum numbers. In the standard\npath integral approach (see Eq. (8)) the time-ordered\nproducts of currents in the vacuum can be evaluated\nby suitable functional derivatives of the generating functional (10) with respect to external bosonic currents,\nand in the large-Nc limit the path integral is driven to\nthe saddle point of the path integral in the presence of\nthose currents. On the other hand, at large Nc any twopoint mesonic correlation function should have the general structure [2, 3]\n\u03a0J (q 2 ) =\n\nX\nn\n\n2\nfJ,n\n2\nMJ,n \u2212\n\nq2\n\n(29)\n\ndue to confinement. This is a very stringent test, since\nit implies in particular a meromorphic analytic structure\nin the q 2 complex plane. Amazingly, this rather simple\nrequirement has never been accomplished in chiral quark\nmodels, either local or nonlocal3 .\nA straightforward consequence of the large-Nc representation of the two point correlator in Eq. (29) is positivity, \u03a0J (q 2 ) > 0, in the Euclidean region q 2 = \u2212Q2 < 0\nand quark unitarity at large values of q 2 . This ensures\nthat, for instance, the inclusive e+ e\u2212 \u2192 hadrons total\ncross section is proportional to the imaginary part of the\npolarization operator in the vector channel. 4\nIn our previous work [53] we have evaluated the V V\nand AA correlators corresponding to the conserved vector\nand axial currents\n\u03bba\n(30)\nJV\u03bc,a (x) = q\u0304(x)\u03b3 \u03bc q(x),\n2\n\u03bba\n\u03bc,a\nJA\n(x) = q\u0304(x)\u03b3 \u03bc \u03b35 q(x)\n(31)\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nInstead, calculations at large values of Q2 have only been confronted to QCD sum rules (see, e.g., Ref.

(21)) for any quark momentum p2 > MV2 /4, in\nspite of the fact that there are no poles in the quark\npropagator. A more detailed analysis is presented in Appendix B. Note that in QCD one obtains these partonlike relations for q 2 \u2192 \u221e. We stress that the coefficients\nof the log terms are precisely such as in the one-loop\nQCD calculation, complying to the parton-hadron duality. Moreover, despite the unconventional features of\nSQM involving complex masses, positivity is preserved\nboth for the pole and for the cut contributions to the\nimaginary parts of the considered correlators, as can be\nseen from Eq. (36). This is a virtue of the spectral model,\nnot easily fulfilled in other chiral quark models7 . It is\nimportant to realize that this quark unitarity relation\nis hidden in the large-Nc meromorphic representation of\nEq. (29) at large q 2 through the asymptotic density of q\u0304q\nstates [70].\nTo see this we may compare to the large-Nc Regge\nmodels (see e.g. [71] and references therein), where the\nmeson spectrum is chosen to be a tower of infinitely many\n2\nradially excited states with masses Mn,V\n= MV2 + 2\u03c0\u03c3n,\nwhere \u03c3 is the string tension and the residue is taken to\n2\nbe constant fn,V\n= Nc \u03c3/(12\u03c0) precisely to implement\nquark-hadron duality at large q 2 . As we see, SQM corresponds to keeping one pole in the vector channel and\napproximating the higher states by a logarithm.

We also recall that the\nlarge-Nc analyses restricted to a finite number of resonances [72, 73] provide a meromorphic structure but fail\nto give the large-q 2 parton-hadron duality conditions.\nFor completeness we also discuss the scalar and pseudoscalar channels, where the currents are given by\n\u03bba\nq(x),\n2\n\u03bba\nJPa (x) = q\u0304(x)i\u03b35 q(x).\n2\nJSa (x) = q\u0304(x)\n\n(42)\n(43)\n\nNo Ward-Takahashi identities may be written for these\ncurrents and thus they are not directly amenable to the\ngauge technique.

In [55] it was also shown\nthat matching L3 of both SQM and the large-Nc SRA\nyields the identity between the scalar and meson masses,\nMS = MV (as we assume for the rest of the paper). It is\ninteresting that the same condition also follows from the\nrequirement of having a single pole in the P P correlator,\nEq. (45).

(49)\nq\n\nE.\n\nIn a previous work [55] it was shown how the WessZumino-Witten term arises for SQM in the presence of\nthe spectral regularization. As a sample calculation illustrating the consistency condition of Sect. II A we compute the baryon current in the limit of spatially large\nbackgrounds. This also shows how the regularization effects cancel in the final result, yielding the well known\nGoldstone-Wilczek current [4]. Taking the appropriate\nfunctional derivative in Eq. (2) we find\nhq\u0304(x)\u03b3 \u03bc q(x)i = i\n\nNc\nf6\n\u2212\n,\n384\u03c0 2\n16hq\u0304qi2\nNc\n,\n= \u2212\n92\u03c0 2\n\nL10\n\n(50)\n\nin agreement with results from the derivative expansion\ncarried out in [55]. The large-Nc SRA yields L8 =\n3f 2 /(32MS2 ) and L10 = \u22123f 2 /(8MV2 ) [72, 73], while\nthe\n\u221a\nlarge-Nc Regge models produce L10 = \u2212Nc /(96 3\u03c0).8\nTo summarize this section, SQM provides meson twopoint correlators which carry poles as well as cuts, while\nstrictly speaking large Nc requires only having poles.\nThus, despite the quark propagator not having poles, the\nmeson correlations do not exhibit true confinement. Although we cannot prove it in general for any correlation\nfunction, all two-point correlators we have considered\nobey positivity and analyticity, i.e. dispersion relations.\nThis is required by the (asymptotic) quark unitarity and\ncausality, i.e. the current commutators must vanish outside the causal cone, [j(x), j(0)] = 0 for x2 < 0. The\ncoefficients of the log terms are in agreement with the\nparton-hadron duality. On the other hand, the second\nWeinberg sum rule is not satisfied, as in other local chiral quark models. This calls for caution, in particular\nwhen analyzing processes sensitive to high-momenta. 9\n\n8\n\n9\n\nAt the mean field level in a gradient expansion the L8 term corresponds to O(m4 ) corrections to the soliton energy, while L10\ncouples to external axial and vector currents. So a slight mismatch in these values should not influence strongly the mean field\nsoliton properties. We estimateRthe corresponding correction to\nthe energy as \u2206E8 = \u2206L8 4m4\u03c0 d3 x[cos(2\u03b8(r)) \u2212 1] \u223c \u22123MeV,\nwith \u2206L8 \u223c 10\u22123 \u2013 a negligible number.\nWe remind that nonlocal models do indeed fulfill this high energy\nconstraint [39] and the violation of the second Weinberg sum rule\nin local models is probably related to the violation of the two\nbody consistency conditions discussed above (see Sects. II A and\nSect. II B). On the other hand it is uncertain if nonlocal models\ndo indeed satisfy analyticity.\n\n1 \u03b4Z\nZ \u03b4v\u03bc (x)\n\n0\n\n1 \u03b4\n\u03b4Z\n= lim\n(\u2212i)2\n\u03b3\u03bc\nx\u2032 \u2192x\nZ \u03b4\u03b7(x) \u03b4 \u03b7\u0304(x\u2032 ) 0\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ\n\u2212i\n\u03bc\nd\u03c9\u03c1(\u03c9)tr \u03b3 hx|\n=\n|xi .(51)\ni/\n\u2202 \u2212 \u03c9U 5\nC\n\nUsing Eqs.

Thus the proper normalization of the\nspectral function is responsible for the correct topological\nproperties in SQM, preservation of anomalies, etc. In\nfact, we view the uniform treatment of the anomalous\nprocesses as one of the main advantages of SQM over\nother local chiral quark models.\n\nIII.\n\nBUILDING THE BARYON\n\nIn this section we show how valence orbits are constructed in SQM. The issue is far from trivial, as unlike the case of local models, there is no obvious Fock\nspace representation. Already the experience of nonlocal models showed that the construction of valenceness\nis an involved issue [48, 49]. There a bound-state pole of\nthe propagator was found in the background of hedgehog\nchiral fields, and this state was occupied with Nc = 3\nvalence quarks. The full contribution to the baryon current (local and nonlocal) yielded a correct (and quantized) baryon number of the soliton. In the present case\nwe face a different situation, with the spectral density\nand inherent complex masses present. Thus we start our\nderivation from very basic field-theoretic foundations, arriving in the end at a very simple prescription holding\nunder plausible assumptions concerning the analyticity\nproperties of the valence eigenvalue as a function of the\ncomplex mass.\n\nA.\n\nInterpolating baryon fields\n\nIn the standard field-theoretic approach a baryon can\nbe described in terms of the corresponding correlation\nfunction\nn\no\n\u03a0B (x, x\u2032 ) = h0|T B(x)B\u0304(x\u2032 ) |0i\n(57)\nwith B(x) denoting an interpolating baryonic operator\nin terms of anti-commuting quark fields.

The resulting\nexpression, in turn, can be obtained by the appropriate functional differentiation of the generating functional\nZ[s, p, v, a, \u03b7, \u03b7\u0304] with respect to the external quark fields\n\u03b7(x) and \u03b7\u0304(x), yielding\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u03a0B (x, x\u2032 ) = \u03a6a1 ,...,aNc \u03a6\u0304a1 ,...,aNc\nZ\nNc\nY\niSai a\u2032i (x, x\u2032 ).\n\u00d7\nDU ei\u0393[U]\n\n(61)\n\ni=1\n\nHere the one-particle Green function in SQM is given by\nZ\n\u0001\u22121\nSaa\u2032 (x, x\u2032 ) =\nd\u03c9\u03c1(\u03c9)hx| i/\n\u2202 \u2212 \u03c9U 5 aa\u2032 |x\u2032 i (62)\nC\u2032\n\nand the one loop effective action has the form\nZ\n\u0001\n\u0393[U ] = \u2212iNc\nd\u03c9\u03c1(\u03c9)Tr log i/\n\u2202 \u2212 \u03c9U 5 .\n\n(63)\n\nC\u2032\n\nNote the presence of the spectral integration, however,\nthe contour C \u2032 to be used in the baryon sector is yet to\nbe determined. There is no a priori reason why it should\nbe equal to the vacuum contour C 10 . The limit Nc \u2192 \u221e\ndrives the functional integral over the bosonic U fields\ninto a saddle point. In the vacuum sector one then obtains the mean-field vacuum. In the baryon sector, due\nto the presence of Nc factors Sa,a\u2032 in the numerator, the\ndominating saddle point configuration is of course different from that of the vacuum and depends non-trivially\non x and x\u2032 .

IV.\nIn the treatment of hedgehog systems it is relevant to\nconsider symmetries such as the grand spin G = I + J,\nthe sum of isospin and spin. The reader is referred to\nRefs. [24, 25, 26, 27] for necessary details.\nC.\n\nThe valence contribution\n\nNow we resort to the numerical calculation of the spectrum in the chiral soliton, described in detail in the proceeding sections. What we need for the present discussion\n\n\f12\nis the behavior of the spectrum when we vary the spectral mass \u03c9 as an independent variable. We focus on the\ngrand-spin 0 parity + state, GP = 0+ , where G = I + J\nis the sum of isospin and spin, appropriate to classify\nstates in the hedgehog background (71). In Fig. 2 we\nshow the dependence of the lowest 0+ eigenvalue on the\nmass parameter M for real masses (in our notation M\nis the same as real \u03c9). Subsequent curves are obtained\nfor the profile (72) with a fixed radius R. In fact, all\nthe displayed curves are related to each other via simple\nscaling. Indeed, introducing \u03be~ = ~r/R and \u03a9 = \u03c9R we\ncan rewrite the Dirac equation in the form\n\u0010\n\u0011\n~ \u03a8n (\u03be;\n~ \u03a9) = En (\u03a9)\u03a8n (\u03be;\n~ \u03a9), (75)\n\u2212i\u03b1 * \u2207\u03be~ + \u03a9U 5 (\u03be)\nwhich depends on a single scale \u03a9. By identification\n\nEn (\u03c9R)\n.\n(76)\nR\nAs can be promptly seen from Fig. 2, for any value of\nR we have for the valence 0+ level the limiting behavior\n\u01ebn (\u03c9) =\n\n\u01eb0 (M ) \u223c M\n\u01eb0 (M ) \u223c \u2212M + a\n\nat\nat\n\nM \u2192 0,\nM \u2192 \u221e,\n\n(77)\n(78)\n\nwhere a is a constant. Correspondingly, at fixed M in the\nlimit of low R (small solitons) we have \u01eb0 (M ) \u2243 M , i.e.\nthe level goes to the top of the gap, whereas in the limit\nof high R (large solitons) the behavior \u01eb0 (M ) \u2243 \u2212M + a\nshows that the level goes to the bottom of the gap. The\nsmall M behavior, together with the reflexion property\nEq. (68) suggests a branch point behavior at the origin\n\u221a\n\u03c9\u21920\n(79)\n\u01eb0 (\u03c9) \u2192 \u03c9 2\n\nwhich is no mystery, since it corresponds to a\u221afree particle with the complex mass and with energy k 2 + \u03c9 2\nat zero momentum. Unfortunately, in our study we only\nhave access to the chiral soliton spectrum for real M ,\nthus we do not possess the information on analyticity\nproperties of the eigenvalues as functions of \u03c9, which is\nfully accessible only in exactly soluble problems.\nIndeed, due to the inherent numerical complications,\nfinite-size discrete basis used, etc., such information\nwould be difficult to obtain numerically in a reliable way.\nThus, we proceed motivated by the real mass results and\nthe analogy to a similar exactly-solvable model presented\nin Appendix D. In other words, our assumptions made\nin the general hedgehog case appear to be justified.\nLet us now review the calculation of the Dirac propagator for the standard case of a real mass. If we first compute the \u03bd integral in Eq. (69), we have to consider the\n\u03b3 contour in the complex-\u03bd space which for real masses\nand hence real eigenvalues has the standard form of going\nbelow the real axis for states with energy below the gap\nand going above the real axis for states above the gap.\nThis yields\nZ\n\u2032\nd\u03bd ei\u03bd(t\u2212t )\n=\n(80)\n\u03b3 2\u03c0i \u03bd \u2212 \u01ebn (M )\n\u2032\n\n[\u03b8(t \u2212 t\u2032 )\u03b8(\u01ebn (M )) \u2212 \u03b8(t\u2032 \u2212 t)\u03b8(\u2212\u01ebn (M ))] e\u2212i\u01ebn (M)(t\u2212t ) ,\n\nhence the positive (negative) energy states propagate forward (backward) in time. This is equivalent to a damped\n(exploding) imaginary-time behavior for t \u2212 t\u2032 \u2192 \u00b1i\u221e.\nThis real mass result coincides with the standard one. If\nwe change M the valence level may change sign (because\nit is equivalent to changing the soliton size R and the\nlevel dives into the sea according to (78)). Thus, according to Eq. (80) one keeps the contour. If we deformed the\ncontour deciding that we occupy the negative eigenvalue\nthen the imaginary-time behavior implying the standard\nparticle (antiparticle) interpretation would be violated.\nLet us now analyze the case of a complex mass. For\nthat purpose we go slightly off the real axis, \u03c9 = M + i\u0393,\nand expand\n\u01ebn (M + i\u0393) = \u01ebn (M ) + i\u0393\u01eb\u2032n (M ) \u2212 12 \u03932 \u01eb\u2032\u2032n (M ) + . . .(81)\nThe edges of the bound state gap and consequently the\nDirac eigenvalues wander into the complex-\u03bd plane moving upwards or downwards, depending on the sign of\n\u01eb\u2032n (M ). The eigenvalues fulfilling \u01eb\u2032n (M ) = 0 stay stationary on the real axis. According to Fig. (2), we have\n\u01eb\u2032\u20320 (M ) < 0 for any M > 0. The question is whether or\nnot we should also deform the contour \u03b3 in the evaluation\nof the propagator (69). On the one hand, the eigenvalues\nlying in the complex plane should not cross the contour,\nas this would lead to discontinuities, thus some deformation must be done. On the other hand, if \u01eb\u20320 (M ) = 0 we\nmove along the real axis in the positive direction by the\namount \u2212 12 \u03932 \u01eb\u2032\u20320 (M ), Eq. (81), hence crossing the contour only in the case where also \u01eb0 (M ) = 0. According\nto Fig. (2) this situation never happens unless M = 0\nor M is much larger than the position of the maximum\n(which, as we will see, is of no relevance to our construction). Hence, we deform the contour in such a way that\nit continues to pass through the \u03bd = 0 point, but never\nallows a complex eigenvalue to intersect. Such a contour\nyields\nZ\n\n\u03b3\n\n\u2032\n\nd\u03bd ei\u03bd(t\u2212t )\n= [\u03b8(t \u2212 t\u2032 )\u03b8(Re \u01ebn (\u03c9))\n2\u03c0i \u03bd \u2212 \u01ebn (\u03c9)\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2212 \u03b8(t\u2032 \u2212 t)\u03b8(\u2212Re \u01ebn (\u03c9))] e\u2212i\u01ebn (\u03c9)(t\u2212t ) . (82)\n\nWe note that the large imaginary time evolution is\ndamped, as we might have expected. In the positive\nt\u2212t\u2032 > 0 branch, where a baryon (and not an antibaryon)\npropagates, we are thus left with the integral\nZ\nd\u03c9\u03c1(\u03c9)\u03b8(Re \u01ebn (\u03c9))e\u2212\u03c4 \u01ebn (\u03c9) .\n(83)\nC\u2032\n\nfor the imaginary time \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e. Note that we only have\nthe positive section of the contour, as implied by the condition Re \u01ebn (\u03c9) > 0. Recall that we wish to occupy the\nlowest 0+ orbit with the eigenvalue \u01eb0 (\u03c9). We proceed by\nusing the saddle-point method. First we have to locate\nstationary points of \u01eb0 (\u03c9), i.e. the points \u03c9m where\n\u01eb\u20320 (\u03c9m ) = 0.\n\n(84)\n\n\f13\n= Z0 e\u2212\u03c4 \u01eb(M0 )\n\nw\u2212Complex Plane\n\n(85)\n\nwhere the wave function renormalization factor Z0 has\nbeen included. Finally, we compare Eq. (85) to Eq. (60)\nand read off the valence contribution to the energy as\n\nC'\nC\n\nEval = Nc \u01eb0 (M0 ).\n\nx\n\u2212Mv / 2\n\nMv / 2\n\nFIG. 3: The deformed contour C \u2032 in the complex \u03c9-plane for\nthe saddle-point evaluation of the valence contribution.\n\nFrom Fig. 2 we find, that for any value of R there exists\na saddle located at the maximum of the curve \u01eb0 (M ).\nWe denote the position of the saddle as M0 11 . We call\nM0 the saddle mass. As we move left from the saddle,\ndecreasing M , we enter at some critical value Mc into the\nupper continuum. On the basis of the toy model results\nof Appendix D, we expect that \u01eb0 (\u03c9) has a branch cut\nat \u03c9 = Mc running downwards. We observe from Fig. 2\nthat the saddles are located right of Mc for any value of\nthe soliton size R.\nIn order to compute the integral in Eq. (83) we deform\nthe original contour C used in the vacuum sector into\nthe contour C \u2032 shown in Fig. 3. It contains the segment\nC \u2032 \u2212 C (dashed line), which runs across \u03c9 = M0 parallel\nto the imaginary axis. Note that it is not necessary to\nchange the path globally but only in the vicinity of the\nstationary point. Making the change of variables \u03c9 =\nM0 + i\u0393, where M0 is the saddle mass, \u01eb\u2032 (M0 ) = 0 we get\nZ\n\nd\u03c9\u03c1(\u03c9)\u03b8(Re \u01ebn (\u03c9))e\u2212\u03c4 \u01ebn (\u03c9)\n\nC \u2032 \u2212C\nZ \u221e\n\n1\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n2\n\nid\u0393\u03c1(M0 )e\u2212\u03c4 \u01eb(M0 ) e 2 \u03c4 \u01ebn (M0 )\u0393\n\u2212\u221e\ns\n2\u03c0\ne\u2212\u03c4 \u01eb(M0 )\n\u223c i\u03c1(M0 )\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2212\u01eb0 (M0 )\u03c4\n\n\u2192\n\n11\n\nA priori we should admit multiple saddles \u03c9m . We choose the\nbranch, denoted \u03c90 , with the lowest possible real part of the\neigenvalue. In addition, the complex reflexion property implies\nthat if \u03c90 is a saddle, then \u03c90\u2217 is also a saddle. As a consequence,\nfor complex saddles the large Euclidean time behavior would\nnot be purely exponential, but also some oscillations would set\nin. This obviously contradicts the spectral decomposition (60),\nwhich allows only for real stationary points. Therefore, although\ncomplex solutions may a priori exist, they should be considered\na spurious result of the model. Similar problems occur also in\nthe local models [69].\n\n(86)\n\nThe necessary conditions are \u01eb\u20320 (M0 ) = 0, \u01eb0 (M0 ) > 0,\nand \u01eb\u2032\u20320 (M0 ) < 0, all satisfied in our case, as shown in\nFig. 2. In addition, the solution is only admissible with\nthe conditions Mc < M0 < MV /2, which guarantee a\nreal residue. As we have already discussed, Mc < M0\nholds for all values of R. For M0 > MV /2 we would have\na complex residue, contradicting the spectral decomposition of the propagator, Eq. (60). According to Fig. 2,\nfor the ansatz (72) this occurs for R < 0.6 fm, where no\nbound-state nucleon can be constructed. Thus, in the\nlarge imaginary time limit t \u2192 \u2212i\u221e and t\u2032 \u2192 +i\u221e we\nget ( see e.g. Eq. (85))\n\u2032\n\nS(x\u2032 , x) \u2192 Z0 \u03a80 (x)\u03a8\u03040 (x\u2032 )e\u2212i(t\u2212t )\u01eb0 ,\n\n(87)\n\nwhere \u03a80 is the valence Dirac spinor.\nTo summarize, our prescription for the valence orbit\nconsists of the following very simple steps:\n1. Obtain (numerically) the spectrum for the valence\norbital as a function of the real positive mass M .\n2. Look for the saddle mass, i.e., a maximum with\nrespect to M , with the help of conditions \u01eb\u20320 (M0 ) =\n0 and \u01eb\u2032\u20320 (M0 ) < 0. From analyticity, this is the\nsaddle point which corresponds to the saddle mass\nM0 .\n3. If Mc \u2264 M0 < MV /2, the valence contribution to\nthe soliton mass is Nc \u01eb0 (M0 ), otherwise there is no\nbaryon state in the model.\nThere is an essential difference between the standard valence prescription based on the Fock-space decomposition, used in local quark models, and our prescription for\nSQM presented above. In the first case the size of the\nprofile, R, and the quark mass, M , can be fixed independently in the Dirac operator, whereas in the present\ncase we actually find a correlation between them. In\nthe quark propagator we have a superposition of masses\n\u03c9 which are integrated over12 , thus no additional independent scale is present in the problem. An immediate\nconsequence can be seen in Fig. 4, where we compare the\nvalence eigenvalue for the profile function (60) along the\nmanifold where \u01eb\u20320 (M ) = 0 (for a given R) to the fixedmass result of the local chiral quark model, obtained with\n\n12\n\nThis reminds of the familiar distinction between the phase and\ngroup velocities of wave packets made out of a continuous superposition of plane waves.\n\n\f14\nMQ = 300 MeV. From the scaled Dirac equation (76)\nand our valence prescription it follows that\n\n700\n\u03b50 (M = M0)\n\u03b5v(M = 300 MeV)\n\n600\n\n(88)\n\nwhere k is a constant depending on the particular profile.\nIn particular, for R \u2192 0 in SQM one has \u01eb0 \u2192 1/R (a\nsignature of a \"repulsive force\"), as opposed to the behavior \u01eb0 \u2192 MQ of a free particle at rest in the case of\nthe fixed-mass model. This means in practice that the\nbound state never becomes unbound in the presence of a\nchiral field background (see the discussion of Sect. III F)\nand reflects the absence of on-shell quarks in the vacuum\n(analytic confinement) in SQM. Another feature of SQM\nwith our valence prescription is that the valence eigenvalue never dives into the negative part of the spectrum.\nThe prescription for fixed-mass models allows the valence\ncontribution to become negative, and this happens with\na finite slope which originates from non-analyticity. This\nentering of the valence level into the negative part of the\nspectrum was interpreted within the chiral quark soliton model as entering the \"Skyrme\" model regime. In\nour approach such a regime never arises. However, the\n1/R dependence of the valence contribution behaves very\nmuch like the Skyrme stabilizing term.\nSimilarly, the saddle mass scales as\nM0 = k \u2032 /R.\n\nThe soliton baryon density and the baryon\nnumber\n\nA crucial point is to show that our soliton corresponds\nto a system with baryon number equal to one. This requires the separation between the valence and sea contributions to the baryon number.

To understand the general trend we will present\nan estimate based on the so-called two point function approximation (TPA) proposed originally in Ref. [20] and\nfurther exploited in Ref. [75, 76].

This is consistent with our finding that the valence level never dives\ninto the negative energy region.\nIt is worth mentioning that the previous calculation\ncan be extended mutatis mutandis to any one body observable and in particular to the energy-momentum tensor. In the following section we analyze the sea contribution as it arises from Eq. (60) onwards.

[77, 78]\nfor the renormalized sea energy, which generated a vacuum Landau instability.\n\nEtot\nEsea\nEval\n\n2500\n2000\n1500\n\nF.\n\nExistence of absolute minima\n1000\n\nThe total soliton energy is the valence plus the sea\ncontribution as\n\n500\n0\n0.2\n\nEB = Eval + Esea .\n\nAt small radii the valence contribution (88) dominates\nand E \u223c 1/R, while at large radii the Dirac sea contribution dominates and E \u223c R. Since the function E(R) is\ncontinuous, on these simple grounds we prove to have a\nminimum. The behavior is illustrated in Fig. (6), where\nwe show the energy dependence as a function of the profile size R for the profile (72). For this restricted configuration one clearly sees the occurrence of an absolute\nminimum as a consequence of the fact that the valence\nquarks never become unbound. In contrast, in the standard approach to chiral quark solitons the valence quarks\nbecome unbound at small R and one has instead a local\nminimum, which becomes unstable when the total soliton\nenergy exceeds that of Nc free quarks at rest, E > Nc M .\nThis instability has been an obvious cause of concern\nsince this situation corresponds to bound but not confined solitons. In practice, it would not be a problem if\nvalence states where deeply bound. However, most calculations have produced solutions which lie on the unstable\nbranch. The fact that our solutions correspond to an absolutely stable state is a remarkable property of SQM\ntogether with our construction of the valence state. Results for other profiles of the chiral field are qualitatively\nsimilar to the case of Fig. 6.\nAnother interesting feature that can be seen from a\ndirect comparison of Figs. 6 and 4 is that the minimum\ntakes place at a soliton size R where the valence state\nfor our model and the fixed-mass models produce a similar dependence. This suggests that the constituent fixed\nmass in soliton models may indeed correspond to a given\nsaddle mass in the spectral construction and that the\nshallow (and unstable) minima found there may indeed\nbe identified as the absolute and stable minima obtained\nhere.\n\nIV.\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n(102)\n\nRESULTS FOR THE SELF-CONSISTENT\nSOLITON\n\nIn this section we describe the numerical properties\nof self-consistent chiral solitons in SQM, as well as the\ncorresponding observables.\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\nR [fm]\n\nFIG. 6: Total energy of the soliton (solid line) and its valence\nand sea components for the profile (72), plotted as functions\nof R. An absolute minimum exists.\n\nA.\n\nEvaluation of observables\n\nAs is well known, observables in hedgehog solitons fall\ninto two categories: independent of and dependent on\ncranking [79]. The second case is much more complicated, hence in this paper we deal only with the quantities that do not involve cranking. Observables independent of cranking can be written in terms of single spectral\nsums of the form\nX\nAi ,\n(103)\nA=\ni\n\nwhere A is the value of the observable in the soliton, and\nAi is the single-particle contribution which includes a valence orbit and the Dirac sea. In the spectral approach\nthis is generalized, in the sense that an extra integration\nover the spectral variable \u03c9 is present. With our method\nof treating the valenceness we also have a separated contribution from Nc occupied valence states,\nA = Aval + Asea ,\nAval = Nc A(\u03c9val ),\nZ\nd\u03c9\u03c1(\u03c9)Asea (\u03c9),\nAsea =\n\n(104)\n\nC\n\nwhere val and sea indicate valence and sea, \u03c9val = M0\nis the saddle mass, \u03c1(\u03c9) is the spectral function consisting of the vector\nand scalar parts given in Eq. (20),\nP\nand Asea (\u03c9) = i\u2208sea Ai (\u03c9) with Ai (\u03c9) denoting the \u03c9dependent single-particle value of the observable in the\norbit i. Due to the hedgehog symmetries for the observables in question one\nP may replace the sum over the\nnegative energy states, i\u2208sea , with 1/2 of the sum over\nP\nall states, 12 n\u2208all .\nThe contour C is invariant under the transformation\n\n\f17\n\u03c9 \u2192 \u2212\u03c9, see Fig. 1.

(20). As we have\nstressed before, the contour C in Fig. 1 is complex. This\nis a complication, since in a numerical calculation we obviously do not have access to A(\u03c9) in the complex \u03c9\nplane. For that reason we use a method which allows\nus to carry on the calculation along the real axis in the\n\u03c9 plane, as explained in Appendix F. According to the\nformalism of Sect.

The first\nterms on the r.h.s. are the valence contributions, evaluated according to the SQM prescription. The second\nterms are the Dirac sea contributions, where the sum\nover the negative-energy states i is carried out, or, equivalently, it can be replaced by 1/2 of the sum over all\nstates.. With the help of formulas (F10,F11) the spectral\nintegration in (109) can be performed as a real-valued integral. The spinors \u03c8i (~x, \u03c9) are obtained by solving the\nDirac equation in the background of the fields s(r) and\np(r) at a given value of \u03c9.\nThe code used to find numerically the self consistent\nsolutions is a modification of the method used in solving\ndifferent versions of chiral-quark models. The quark orbits are calculated by diagonalizing H for each value of\n\u03c9 in the discrete Kahana-Ripka basis [16]. The EulerLagrange equations are solved by iteration. The numerical effort involved in the calculation is similar to that in\nthe case of solitons in non-local models [48, 49].\n\nC.\n\nThe self-consistent solution\n\n1/(2 u)\n\n\u00d7\n\nX \u01ebi (\u03c9, m) \u00b1 \u01ebi (\u03c9, \u2212m)\n2\n\ni\n\n.\n\n(107)\n\nIn the chiral limit\n\u0112V (u) = 2\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u221a\n1/(2 u)\n\ndisc[\u03c1\u0304V (\u03c9)]\n\n\u0112S (u) = 0.\n\nX\n\n\u01ebi (\u03c9, 0),\n\ni\n\n(108)\n\nAll observables not involving cranking can be evaluated\nwith the technique described above and with the help\nof \"standard\" formulas at each \u03c9. The derivatives with\nrespect to u are carried out numerically.\nB.\n\nSelf-consistent equations\n\nNow we present some details of our self-consistent procedure. We use the linear representation of the hedgehog\nfield, U = s + ir\u0302 *~\u03c4 p, and impose the nonlinear constraint\ns2 + p2 = 1 by renormalizing the fields after each numerical iteration. The Euler-Lagrange equations for the\nradial s and p fields are obtained from Eq. (G1) and have\nthe form\ns(r)\n= Nc \u03c8\u03040 (~x, M0 )\u03c80 (~x, M0 )\ng2\n\nFor the sake of obtaining physical properties of the\nsoliton, we use two versions of the model. The first\none (model I) is just the standard meson-dominance\nSQM, with the single vector meson mass, MV = m\u03c1 =\n769 MeV. This model (in the chiral limit) has only\none scale, thus all observables are proportional to the\nvalue of MV in appropriate power. In particular, f\u03c02 =\nMV2 /(8\u03c0 2 ). The second model (model II) includes also\nthe excited \u03c1 state, \u03c1\u2032 (1465). The spectral function is\ntaken to be the weighted sum of Eq. (20), containing\n90% of the ground-state \u03c1, and 10% of excited \u03c1. All\nquantities are distributive over the spectral density, e.g.\n2\nf\u03c02 = 0.9m2\u03c1 /(8\u03c0 2 )+ 0.1m\u20322\n\u03c1 /(8\u03c0 ). Model II contains two\nscales, and produces somewhat heavier and more compact solitons, as expected on simple scaling grounds. We\nwork with the physical pion, m\u03c0 = 139.6 MeV, and the\ncurrent quark mass is adjusted such that the GMOR relation is fulfilled, mhq\u0304qi = m2\u03c0 f\u03c02 .\nThe results of the self-consistent calculation for the\ncase with physical pion mass are displayed in Table I\nand in Fig. 7. The chiral corrections are small and do\nnot alter our basic conclusions. We note that for both\nmodels the value of the saddle mass M0 is well below the\ncritical value 21 MV discussed in Sect. III.\nComparing the soliton energy to the experimental nucleon mass we should be aware that our soliton is a\nmean-field solution with grand spin 0 and should not\n\n\f18\n1\n\nmodel I model II experiment\n1.23\n1.07\n[fm] 1.24\n1.08\n0.79\n0.79\n0.79\n0.93\n0.95\n1.26\n2.40\n2.07\n2.96\n2.67\n4.71\n36\n33\n45 \u00b1 8\n\np\n2\nphr iI=0,val [fm]\n\n0.8\n\nhr 2 iI=0,total\ngA (val)\ngA (total)\n\u03bcI=1 (val)\n\u03bcI=1 (total)\n\u03c3\u03c0N [MeV]\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n-0.2\n-0.4\n-0.6\n-0.8\n-1\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\nr [fm]\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\nFIG. 7: The s \u2261 cos \u03b8 and p \u2261 sin \u03b8 fields as a function of the\nradius r for the two self-consistent solutions of Table I: the\nsolid lines for the model I and the dashed lines for model II.\n\nbe identified with the nucleon, but rather with the average of the mass of the nucleon and the \u2206(1232) isobar 12 (MN + M\u2206 ) = 1174 MeV.

The valence contribution (val) is given separately. The\ncontribution from the sea (not given explicitly) is dominated\nby the vector part, similarly as in the case of the energy. The\nexperimental value of \u03c3\u03c0N is taken from Ref. [82].\n\ncranking. Inclusion of cranking, which requires a linearresponse calculation, is numerically involved and is outside of the scope of this study. In Table II we display some\ncharacteristic observables of the self consistent solution\nfor the choice of parameters of of Table I. Firstly, we\nnote that the isoscalar rms charge radius of the soliton is\ntoo large as compared to the experiment. This quantity\nis dominated by the valence contribution, as can also be\nseen from Fig. 8. The quark spinors of the valence wave\nfunction exhibit a long tail which is a feature related to\nour prescription for constructing the valence\norbit. The\np\nlarge r behavior is of the formpexp(\u2212 M02 \u2212 \u01eb20 r), and\nin our case the value of \u03ba = M02 \u2212 \u01eb20 is small, with\n\u03ba = 1/(1.5 fm) in model I and \u03ba = 1/(1.3 fm) in model II.\nThe large soliton radius can perhaps be reduced by subtracting the spurious center-of-mass motion of the soliton. Including higher vector mesons in the model tends to\nreduce the soliton size, as expected by scaling arguments,\nhowever, on the expense of increasing f\u03c0 and Etotal .\nIn the evaluation13 of gA and the isovector magnetic\nmoment \u03bcI=1 we use the semiclassical projection coefficients as obtained in the large-Nc limit [79]. Both values\nare lower than the corresponding experimental values.\nBut since our solution is dominated by the valence state\nwe could as well, instead of the semiclassical projection,\nuse the quark model wave functions for evaluation of the\nvalence parts of observables. Then the expectation value\nof the \u03c3\u03c4 operator for the proton and the neutron yields\nthe coefficient 95 instead of 13 .

However, the precise realization of this attractive and fruitful idea is still unclear. Many model Lagrangeans have been proposed, emphasizing different aspects of the problem and incorporating as many known\nfeatures of the underlying quark-gluon dynamics as possible. While on the one hand the Skyrme soliton models\nincorporate confinement but not the spin-1/2 partons,\non the other hand, chiral quark soliton models account\nfor spin-1/2 partons but lack the confinement property.\nThis unsatisfactory situation has been calling for improvement. As a first and hopefully useful step, we have\nconsidered a model where quark poles on the real axis are\nabsent, be it in the vacuum or in the soliton. Unfortunately, confinement does not hold since basic large-Nc requirements on the analytic structure of meson correlators\nare violated, similarly to other effective quark models.\nOn the other hand the Spectral Quark Model provides\na framework with spin-1/2 partons in the vacuum which\nsimultaneously allows for baryonic soliton solutions cor-\n\nThe solitons we find fit nicely into the phenomenological expectations of more standard chiral quark solitons\nwith full inclusion of the polarized Dirac sea. In contrast\nto constituent chiral quark models where one is allowed to\ntune the constituent quark mass as a free parameter, the\nSpectral Quark Model does not have this freedom. In our\ncase the vector meson mass determines one unique solution in the chiral limit and thus all properties scale with\nthis mass. Actually, due to the superposition of complex spectral masses \u03c9, in the soliton calculation there\nappears a saddle mass, M0 , defined as a stationary point\nof the valence quark eigenvalue as a function of \u03c9 in a\nfixed soliton profile. In the chiral limit M0 also scales\nwith the vector meson mass and thus is a fixed number. To some extent the saddle mass behaves as a constituent quark mass determined uniquely by the soliton,\nand its numerical value comes out within the expected\nrange M0 \u223c 300MeV for the typical solitons minimizing\nthe total energy. Moreover, the close resemblance of the\nvalence contribution to the energy around the minimum\nsuggests that the phenomenology and results of previous calculations within constituent chiral quark models\nwith a constant mass are reproduced, at least for the\nlow-lying baryon states. The new aspect unveiled by our\ncalculation is the possibility of studying the monopole vibrations and their quantization which are the traditional\ncandidate for describing excited baryonic states such as,\ne.g., the Roper resonance. While studies of this sort are\nroutinely carried out in the Skyrme model, the lack of\nconfinement in the traditional chiral quark soliton model\nhas prevented, as a matter of principle, calculations of\nexcited states.\nOne distinguishing feature of the Spectral Quark\nModel construction is the verification of an important\nconsistency relation involving quark two-point functions\nwhich were not fulfilled for fixed constituent mass chiral\nquark models. This feature, in addition to the uniform\ntreatment of regularization removes theoretical doubts\non the proper computation of the high-energy processes\nas regards their partonic interpretation and normalization. As we have mentioned, one motivation for using\nchiral quark soliton models is the spin 1/2 nature of the\nconstituents, which makes the calculation of partonic distributions in the nucleon possible as a matter of principle.\nThe results found in the present paper pave the way for\nsuch a calculation in the soliton picture where the interplay between the analyticity enforced by the lack of\non-shell quarks and the chiral symmetry may simultaneously be tested for the low-lying baryon states.\n\n\f20\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis research is supported by the Polish Ministry of\nEducation and Science, grants 2P03B 02828, by the\nSpanish Ministerio de Asuntos Exteriores and the Polish\nMinistry of Education and Science, project 4990/R04/05,\nby the Spanish DGI and FEDER funds with grant\nno.

To gain some insight and develop some\nintuition, in this Appendix we consider a few cases of\nnon-relativistic quantum mechanical system with complex coupling potentials. Our aim is to define what we\nmean by the energy eigenvalues for a complex coupling,\nassuming that we know the definition for the real coupling, and to determine its analytic properties in the\ncomplex plane. The most natural and obvious way to\ndo so is in terms of analytic continuation in the coupling\nfrom the real case.\nAs a first example let us consider the harmonic oscillator which has the reduced potential U = 2mV = m2 \u03c9 2 x2\nand the ground state energy is given by E0 (\u03c9) = \u03c9/2 for\nreal \u03c9 > 0. The problem is obviously invariant under\nthe change \u03c9 \u2192 \u2212\u03c9, and we should write E0 (\u03c9) = |\u03c9|/2\nfor real \u03c9. Clearly, we have a branch cut at \u03c9 = 0 as a\nfunction of the coupling \u03c9 2 , hence the right way to\n\u221a write\nthe energy for a complex coupling is E0 (\u03c9) = \u03c9 2 /2.\nWritten this way\nthe bound state wave function is given\n\u221a\n\u2212 \u03c9 2 x2 /2\nby \u03c80 = Ce\n. The analytic continuation of the\ndecreasing exponential becomes an increasing exponential on the second Riemann sheet, \u03c9 2 \u2192 e2\u03c0i \u03c9 2 . For\nnegative \u03c9 2 we have a negative energy. So, the energies\non the first and second Riemann sheets differ only in the\nsign.\nAs a second example let us consider the hydrogen atom\nwhere we have V = \u2212Z/r with Z > 0 and the energy\n\nis E0 (Z) = \u2212Z 2 /2. This suggests an analytic behavior\nin Z, and in particular having a continued bound state\nsolution for repulsive potentials (Z < 0). Again, the\nbound state function u(r) = re\u2212Zr transforms into a\npositive exponential for negative Z. So, we have a cut at\nZ = 0. For negative Z we have a real energy but it is\non the second Riemann sheet. In this case the energy on\nthe first and the second Riemann sheets coincide.\nAs a final example, more directly related to the more\ncomplicated case of the toy model for the Dirac equation\nin Appendix D , we analyze the complex square well potential for which we have U (r) = \u2212U0 \u0398(R \u2212 r), with U0\ncomplex. For real U0 the s-wave bound state solution is\ngiven by (we take 2m = 1)\nu(r) = \u0398(R \u2212 r)Ae\u2212\u03bar + \u0398(r \u2212 R)B sin Kr\n\n(C1)\n\nwhere\n\u03ba=\n\n\u221a\n\u2212E\n\n,\n\nK=\n\np\nU0 \u2212 E\n\n(C2)\n\nThe continuity condition for the logarithmic derivative\nyields the bound state relation\n\u2212 \u03ba = K cot KR\n\n(C3)\n\nwhich defines an implicit function E0 (U0 ) which we want\nto extend to complex U0 . For real U0 there is a critical\nvalue U0,c = (\u03c0/2R)2 above which the equation has real\nsolutions. Actually, close to the threshold we have for\nU0 > U0,c the ground state\n1\n2\nE0 (U0 ) = \u2212 R2 (U0 \u2212 U0,c )\n4 \u0012\n\u0013\n4\n1 4\n+ R 1 \u2212 2 (U0 \u2212 U0,c )3 + . . . , (C4)\n8\n\u03c0\nwhich suggests an analytic behavior of the energy. Again,\nit is the wave function at large distances where we see\nthat \u03ba \u2192 \u2212\u03ba if we loop once about the critical point\nU0,c = (\u03c0/2R)2 in the complex U0 plane. In this particular case, this corresponds to the well known fact that\na square well potential with a subcritical coupling has\na virtual state and no bound state. As U0 \u2192 0+ one\ngets \u03ba \u2192 \u2212\u221e or E0 \u2192 \u2212\u221e on the second Riemann\nsheet. Similar features should appear also for excited\nstates, En , with the corresponding critical values. Thus,\nwe may define the continuous function E0 (U0 ) for all real\nvalues of U0 . For U0 > U0,c it corresponds to a bound\nstate, whereas for U0 < U0,c it describes a virtual state.\nIf we go now to the complex plane in U0 we get the\nimplicit function defined through\nA(k, U ) = 0\n\n(C5)\n\nIf we have a solution A(k0 , U0 ) = 0 and go close to it,\nthen by Taylor expanding we get\n0 = A(k0 + \u2206k, U0 + \u2206U )\n\u2202A(kc , Uc )\n\u2202A(kc , Uc )\n= A(k0 , U0 ) +\n\u2206k +\n\u2206U\n\u2202k\n\u2202U\n(C6)\n\n\f24\nThis way we can define a one to one relation unless either\nderivative vanishes at a critical point\n\u2202A(kc , Uc )\n=0\n\u2202k\n\nor\n\n\u2202A(kc , Uc )\n=0\n\u2202U\n\n(C7)\n\nIf this is the case we have a square root branch point\nassuming\n\u2202 2 A(kc , Uc )\n6= 0\n\u2202k 2\n\n(C8)\n\nIn our case we have the critical points located at\n\u2212 \u03ba = K cot(KR)\n\u03baR\n\u03ba\n\u22121 =\n+\ncot(KR)\n2\nsin(KR)\nK\n\n(C9)\n(C10)\n\nCombining both equations we get\n\u03bac = \u2212\n\n1\nR\n\nEc = \u2212\n\n1 = KR cot(KR)\n\n1\nR2\nUc =\n\n(C11)\n1 + x2n\nR2\n\n(C12)\n\nwith xn = 0, \u00b14.49, \u00b17.72, \u00b110.9, . . .. Moreover, we have\nR 3 Uc\n\u2202 2 A(kc , Uc )\n=\n\u2202k 2\nR 2 Uc \u2212 1\n\n(C13)\n\nwhich diverges for Uc = 1/R2 . Note that the critical\npoints are located in the second Riemann sheet. They\ngenerate branch points of second order, i.e. looping twice\naround the point the function returns to its original value.\nThe Riemann surface is obtained by joining all critical\npoints with a line. Since they are infinitely many, the\ncut divides the complex U plane into two disjoint pieces.\nThe complete and extensive study of Riemann sheets of\nthis particular problem can be looked up at Ref. [83].\nThe main outcome is that the analytic structure of a\nthe analyticly continued eigenvalues of a complex coupling potential can be determined by the study of the\ncritical points which generate branch cuts. Otherwise,\nthe function is analytic in the complex coupling plane.\nThis situation appears also in Appendix D for the Dirac\noperator with a complex mass.\nAPPENDIX D: ANALYTIC PROPERTIES OF\nTHE VALENCE EIGENSTATE IN A TOY MODEL\n\nThe discussion in Sect. III made explicit use of the\nfact that an integration path in the complex mass plane\nof the Dirac Hamiltonian can be deformed without pinching any singularities. Although we cannot prove this in\ngeneral, the complex-mass coupling Dirac systems may\nhave unusual properties. In this appendix we investigate\na model baring similarity to the full chiral model where\nour assumptions are verified. The main issue is both\nto define the meaning of an eigenvalue as a function of\n\nthe complex mass \u03c9 as well as to determine its analytic\nproperties in the complex-mass plane. To our knowledge this topic is not discussed in the literature at all.\nHowever, strong similarities are found with the analytic\nproperties of the energy eigenvalues of complex potentials, which have been motivated in the context of optical models [84, 85] and for review purposes Appendix C\nincludes some warm-up quantum-mechanical problems\nwhich may be helpful in the understanding of analyticity\nproperties that arise in studies of our type. The prescription for valenceness derived in Sect. III holds under\nspecific conditions. In the chiral soliton model we have\nno precise knowledge of the analytic properties, hence it\nis not mathematically proven that the prescription can\nactually be used. The model of this section is much simpler and solvable semi-analyticly. It shows that the desired analytic properties are fulfilled, providing support\nfor the method in application to the chiral soliton model\ndescribed in this paper.\nLet us consider the Dirac equation for the state with 0\ngrand-spin and positive parity, GP = 0+ , with the upper\ncomponent u and the lower component v. It has the form\nu\u2032 = \u2212uM sin \u03b8 \u2212 v(\u01eb + M cos \u03b8)\n2\nv \u2032 = u(\u01eb \u2212 M cos \u03b8) + v(\u2212 + M sin \u03b8)\n(D1)\nr\nwith the usual boundary conditions for a normalizable\nstate\nu\u2032 (0) = 0, v(0) = 0, u(\u221e) = 0, v(\u221e) = 0.\n\n(D2)\n\nFollowing Ref. [86] we look for a solution with the profile\nfunction\n\u03b8(r) = \u03c0\u0398(R \u2212 r),\n\n(D3)\n\nwhere \u0398(x) the standard Heaviside step function. The\nprofile (D3) has the winding number (\u03b8(0)\u2212\u03b8(\u221e))/\u03c0 = 1.\nThe analytic solution is\n\u0012\n\u03ba3 sinh \u03bar\nu(r) = N \u0398(R \u2212 r)\n\u01eb+M\nr\n\u0013\n\u2212\u03bar\n3\ne\n\u03ba\n,\n+ \u0398(r \u2212 R)\nM \u2212\u01eb r\n\u0010\n\u03ba\nv(r) = N \u0398(R \u2212 r) 2 (\u03bar cosh(\u03bar) \u2212 sinh(\u03bar))\nr\n\u0013\ne\u2212\u03bar\n+ \u0398(r \u2212 R)\u03ba(\u03bar + 1) 2\n,\n(D4)\nr\n\u221a\nwhere \u03ba = M 2 \u2212 \u01eb2 and\nR N is the normalization factor chosen such that N 2 d3 x(u2 + v 2 ) = 1. Using the\nmatching condition expressing the continuity of u(r)/v(r)\nat r = R we get the eigenvalue equation\n\u03baR(M \u2212 \u01eb) + 2M\n(D5)\n\u01eb+M\nwhich can be written it terms of dimensionless variables\nx = \u03baR and x0 = M R as\np\nx(x0 \u00b1 x20 \u2212 x2 ) + 2x0\np\n,\n(D6)\nx coth(x) =\n\u00b1 x20 \u2212 x2 + x0\n\u03baR coth(\u03baR) =\n\n\f25\n\u03950 R\n1\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\nMR\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\nFIG. 9: Valence eigenvalue \u01eb0 for the toy model (D1,D3) as a\nfunction of the soliton size R in units of 1/M .\n\nwhere \u00b1 corresponds to the positive (negative) energy\nstates, \u01eb > 0 (\u01eb < 0 ). The value x = 0 is formally always\na solution of Eq. (D6), but it does not correspond to a\nzero momentum state \u01eb0 = M since the solution is\n1\n2M\n\u0398(R \u2212 r) +\n\u0398(r \u2212 R)\nR2\nr\n1\n2M r\n+ \u0398(r \u2212 R) 2 ,\nv(r) = \u0398(R \u2212 r)\n3R2\nr\n\nu(r) =\n\n(D7)\n(D8)\n\nwhich are regular both at r = 0 and r = \u221e but fail\nto fulfill the matching condition since v/u = 2M r/3 for\nr > R whereas v/u = 2M r for r > R.\nThe numerical dependence of the eigenvalue as a function of the soliton size for the 0+ state in the toy model\nis depicted in Fig. 9. For large values of the soliton size\nat fixed mass we get\n\u01eb0 (R) \u2192\n\n1\nR\n\n(D9)\n\nwhich means according to the scaling property that this\nbehavior also holds true for large mass and fixed radius.\nThe solution is always in the positive energy region and\nnever dives into the sea (despite having topological number 1 \u2013 this was actually the point of Ref. [86]). For\nR \u2192 \u221e one gets \u01eb0 (R) \u2192 0+ . The reason is related to\nthe fact that always sin \u03b8 = 0 for the profile, and we have\na scalar coupling for which H\u03b30 \u03b35 = \u2212\u03b30 \u03b35 H and the\nspectrum is symmetric.\nThe threshold value for having a bound state is\n(M R)2 > 3/4. Note that since \u03baR = x changes sign\nacross the threshold value, the bound state becomes virtual (exponentially growing). Thus, the analytic continuation of the unbound valence state for R2 M 2 < 3/4 is\nan exponentially growing state.\nEquation (D6) defines implicitly a relation between x\nand x0 . Actually, we can compute the inverse function\nx20 =\n\nx4 (coth(x) + 1)2\n4(x + 1) (x coth(x) \u2212 1)\n\nFIG. 10: Solid straight lines are \u01eb = \u00b1M , the solid curve is\nthe bound state, the dashed curve is the virtual state. Blobs\nindicate the position of the saddle, the emergence of a bound\nstate, and the bifurcation point of two real virtual states into\ntwo complex states. For the bound state \u01eb0 R approaches unity\nat M R \u2192 \u221e, while for the virtual branch it approaches the\nnegative continuum.\n\n(D10)\n\nFor x > 0 the function on the r.h.s. is a monotonously increasing function and thus the inverse is uniquely defined.\nThe minimum takes place at x = 0 and assumes the value\nof 3/4. Hence there are no positive energy bound state\nsolutions for x20 \u2264 3/4. For x20 = 3/4 we have a negative\nenergy solution \u03baR = x \u2243 \u22120.848 and \u01eb \u2243 \u22120.175/R, of\nno concern here. For 0.512 \u2264 x20 \u2264 3/4 we have a positive\nenergy state with \u03ba < 0. For 0.512 > x20 the value of \u03ba\nbecomes complex. For x0 \u2192 0 we get x \u2192 \u2212\u221e.\nIn summary, for the real-mass case we have\n\u2022 For 0.866 < x0 we have one bound state solution.\n\u2022 For 0.797 < x0 < 0.866 we have one virtual state\nsolution.\n\u2022 For 0.712 < x0 < 0.797 we have two virtual states.\nFor x0 = 0.7968 one at x = \u22120.797 and the other\none at x = \u22120.196, the higher one being a continuation of the previous case.\n\u2022 For x0 < 0.716 the two solutions collide at x =\n\u22120.574 and bifurcate into the complex plane.\nSo clearly for x0 < 0.797 we have a cut in the \u03ba plane.\nThe situation for the real mass case has been displayed\nin Fig. 10. This plot should be compared with the exponential soliton profile of Fig. 2.\nWe can now proceed to the complex plane in \u03c9. The\nobvious way to define the eigenvalue \u01eb0 (\u03c9) as a function of the complex variable \u03c9 is by analytic continuation, since we want to follow the evolution of the state\nin the complex-mass plane. For illustration purposes we\nplot in Fig. 11 the corresponding analyticly continued\neigenvalues when \u03c9 = ei\u03b1 for several soliton sizes R.\n\n\f26\nthe modular landscape of the exponential as explained in\ndetail in Refs. [84, 85].\nThe upshot of this study is that \u01eb(\u03c9) has only critical points on the second Riemann sheet. This means\nthat whenever the bound state becomes unbound we are\ncrossing the branch cut, which happens for sufficiently\nsmall values of \u03c9. For the spectral integral that would\nset the condition Mc < MV /2 not to have cut intersection\nbetween the spectral function and the energy function.16\n\nFIG. 11: analyticly continued complex valence eigenvalue\n\u01eb0 (R, w) in the toy model plotted as a function of the complex mass \u03c9 = ei\u03b1 for \u03b1 in the first quadrant, 0 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 \u03c0/2.\nThe axes represent Re(\u01eb0 ) and Im(\u01eb0 ). Subsequent curves,\nfrom right to left, correspond to increasing values of R =\n2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 3.9. The points on the real axis are for \u03b1 = 0,\nand the value of \u03b1 parameterizes the curves, which evolve\naway from the real axis. The other quadrants are obtained\nby reflection about the real axis.\n\nEquivalently, we consider the function of the variable x20 .\nThus, we take the solutions which were defined for real\nM fulfilling the boundary conditions and arrive at the\ntranscendental equation (D6), which now defines implicitly \u01eb0 (\u03c9).15 Thus, if we differentiate with respect to x\nthe implicit function we get the equation for the critical\npoints\n\u221a\n2t4 + t3 \u2212 4t2 \u2212 2t + 1 + (2t + 3) 1 \u2212 t2\n\u221a\n\u221a\n= 0, (D11)\nt 1 \u2212 t2 (1 + 1 \u2212 t2 )2\nwhere for simplicity the variable t = x/x0 has been introduced. This is an algebraic equation with solutions\nt = tn . We find numerically\ntn = x/x0 = \u22121.2741 \u00b1 i0.1174 , 0.9092,\n1.3898 \u00b1 i0.4832, . . . ,\n(D12)\nwhich forms a bundle of solutions\np\nx0 tn (1 \u2212 1 \u2212 t2n ) + 2tn\np\ntn x0 coth(tn x0 ) =\n. (D13)\n1 \u2212 t2n + 1\n\nWe see that for any value of tn there are infinitely many\nsolutions for x0 . Roughly, they are located along a\nstraight line. For instance, for x/x0 = 0.9092 the critical\npoints in x0 are located at about x0 = 0.5+in\u03c0 for largeN . So, the whole critical points structure looks like five\nstraight lines running in all directions. An alternative\ntechnique to analyze this kind of problems is by using\n\nAPPENDIX E: COMPUTING THE SPECTRAL\nINTEGRAL FOR THE VALENCE\nCONTRIBUTION FIRST\n\nIn this appendix we show how our basic result for\nthe valence contribution, Eq. (86), can be reproduced\nby evaluating the spectral integral first. In fact, experience with perturbative calculations of quantities such as\nf\u03c0 or the pion form factor suggest that there is no danger\nin computing the \u03c9 integral first. At finite temperature\nthis is actually the only way to get analytic results [88].\nTo compute the troublesome spectral integral first in the\nsoliton case, we transform the scalar-pseudoscalar coupling into a vector-axial derivative coupling and a constant mass.

Now, it would be interesting to see if there are chiral angles \u03b8(r) for which one always has\na bound state. In such a case cuts would not intersect. This is\nnot such a strange situation, since e.g. in one dimensional quantum mechanics, any tiny attractive potential generates immediately a bound state. Also, in 1+1 dimensions the chiral angle\n\u03b8(x) = \u03b1sign(x) has always a bound state \u01eb = M cos(\u03b1) [87].\n\n\f27\nis clearly the case of the meson dominance model (20).\nEquation (E3) is just a functional relation, and does not\ndepend on the fact that the variable /p is a matrix. We\nhave indeed computed the spectral integral, but for this\nformula to be of any use, we have to look for the eigenvalue problem of the chirally rotated Dirac operator\n\u0001\ni/\n\u2202 + u\u22125 i/\n\u2202 u\u22125 \u03a6n = Mn \u03a6n .\n(E4)\n\nThis eigenvalue problem may be tricky in practice since\nthe operator is not normal, i.e. the adjoint operator does\nnot commute with the original operator even if we go to\nthe Euclidean space (where the derivative and the vector\npart of the coupling are anti self-adjoint and the axial\npart is self adjoint). This means that Mn may be complex\nin general.\nUndoing field dependent chiral rotation we get\n\u0001\n(E5)\ni/\n\u2202 \u2212 Mn U 5 \u03a8n = 0,\n\nwhere\n\n\u03a8n = u\u22125 \u03a6n ,\n\n\u03a8\u2020n = \u03a6\u2020n u\u22125 .\n\n(E6)\n\nThus, the eigenvalue problem corresponds to the search\nfor the (eigen)masses of the original Dirac operator which\nyield a zero mode of the four dimensional Dirac operator. This equation looks as an on-shell condition for\nthe bound quarks. In the stationary field case we have,\n\u03a8n (~x, t) = e\u2212i\u01ebt \u03c8n (~x). At this point we must make a\nchoice on the values of \u01eb. A natural condition would be to\nrequest an exponential damping in the Euclidean space.\nThus, we take \u01eb real and positive for forward propagating states, t > 0, and negative for backward propagating\nstates. (Another possibility that would be to take a contour with conditions on Re \u01eb),\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u2212i\u03b1 * \u2207 + Mn \u03b2U 5 \u03c8n = \u01eb\u03c8n .\n(E7)\n\nThus, here we encounter just the opposite problem to\nthe case of the spectral mass problem; for a given energy we have to look for the eigenmasses, Mn (\u01eb) (instead\nof \u01ebn (\u03c9)). Actually, this looks like an isospectral problem; given the energy how many chiral couplings possess the same energy. Thus, the eigenvectors of this\nproblem are not exactly the eigenvectors of the standard\nDirac Hamiltonian problem. Note also that because we\nare searching for zero modes of the Dirac operator its\neigenvectors are also eigenvectors of the Dirac Hamiltonian, which is not the case for non-zero eigenvalues, i.e.\n\u03b30 (i\u2202t \u2212H)\u03a8n = \u03bbn \u03a8n with \u03bbn 6= 0 cannot be solved by a\neigenstate of H because of the \u03b30 . Clearly, multivaluedness issues may become quite relevant when discussing\nthe possible equivalence of both problems. On the other\nhand, H \u2020 = H if and only if Mn (\u01eb) is real. For such a\ncase if both Mn and \u01eb are real, then bound states happen for \u2212Mn < \u01eb < Mn . In general Mn is complex,\np since\neven in the free case, U = 1, we have Mn (\u01eb) = \u01eb2 \u2212 kn2 ,\nwith kn denoting the momentum quantized due to box\n\nboundary conditions.

However, it is possible to rewrite this\ncontribution as a real mass distribution.
