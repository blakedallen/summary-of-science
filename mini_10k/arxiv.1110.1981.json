When\nthe map F in question is stable, the typical local situation is the following:\nSingularities of F are found along stratified subsets of source and target of\nF . Each stratum consists of points where a certain singular germ f appears\nas a singularity of F . These strata are submanifolds of source and target,\nrespectively, and in tubular neighborhoods of these submanifolds, F restricts to\na fibered family of germs f , as illustrated in fig. 1. Such decompositions are\ndiscussed in detail in [2].\nThe singular germs are determined up to changes of local coordinates in\nsource and target of the germ, also called a right-left equivalence, or, in modern\nterminology, an A -equivalence. Two germs f, g : (Rn , 0) \u2192 (Rp , 0) are right-leftequivalent, and hence define the same singularity, if there exist diffeomorphism\ngerms \u03c6 : (Rn , 0) \u2192 (Rn , 0) and \u03c8 : (Rp , 0) \u2192 (Rp , 0) such that g = \u03c8 \u25e6f \u25e6\u03c6. The\ngroup A of all such equivalences (\u03c6, \u03c8) coincides with the product of groups\nR \u00d7 L , where R consists of source diffeomorphism germs \u03c6 and L consists of\n\u2217 1) Department of Computer Science, University of Copenhagen, Universitetsparken 1,\n2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; aasa@diku.dk.\n\u2020 Department of Mathematical Sciences, Aarhus University, Ny Munkegade 118, Bldg 1530,\n8000 Aarhus, Denmark.\n\n1\n\n\fFigure 1: Along the two submanifolds S1 and S2 of the source manifold N , we\nfind singularities f1 and f2 , which are both mapped onto the submanifold St of\nthe target manifold P . If F is stable, then in tubular neighborhoods T1 and T2 ,\nF will restrict to a fibered map f \u00d7 idS , where f = f1 t f2 . In order to combine\nconstructions on such local decompositions back into a global construction, we\nneed to understand the symmetry group Af .\ntarget diffeomorphism germs \u03c8. These groups all act on the space of multigerms\nf : (Rn , 0) \u2192 (Rp , 0) through composition of maps, e.g., (\u03c6, \u03c8) * f = \u03c8 \u25e6 f \u25e6 \u03c6.\nThe fibered family of singularities in fig. 1 defines a fiber bundle, whose structure group is the stabilizer Af of A -equivalences leaving f invariant. In order\nto patch local constructions on such local fiber bundles together, it becomes\nessential to understand Af . In reality, the germ f will often be a multigerm,\nwhere each point in the target of the map corresponds to several source points,\njust like in fig. 1. Thus, we need to understand Af in the case where f has\nseveral source basepoints. For instance, knowledge of the structure of Af for\nmultigerms f is used in [3, 2] to prove topological stability of maps.\nIn this article, we show that given a finitely A -determined multigerm f ,\nthe group Af has a maximal compact subgroup, which is unique up to conjugacy. We denote an arbitrary representative of the conjugacy class by M C(Af ),\nand we show that the quotient Af /M C(Af ) is contractible, where contractibility is defined through a smooth map extension property. Geometrically, this\nmeans that we can reduce the non-topological structure group Af of the tubular neighborhood bundle to the compact, finite-dimensional Lie group given by\nM C(Af ).\nMost of the results presented in this article have been proven for monogerms\nby K. J\u00e4nich [6], C.T.C. Wall [15] and R. Rim\u00e1nyi [12]. Other groups of germ\nequivalences have also been studied. In his thesis [11, Theorem 1.6.3], Rim\u00e1nyi\nstates our main theorem in the case of A -equivalences for stable multigerms,\nwithout proof.\nFor some classical groups of germ equivalences, the step from monogerms to\nmultigerms is trivial. It is easy to see that we can decompose\nthe groups K\nF\nand Kf , defined on p. 5, for multigerms f = f1 t . . . t fs : s (Rn , 0) \u2192 (Rp , 0)\nto a product of K -groups for monogerms: K (s \u2212 multigerms) = K s and\nKf = Kf1 \u00d7 . . . \u00d7 Kfs . Similarly, for the group of source diffeomorphisms, or\nR-equivalences, we have R(s \u2212 multigerms) = R s and Rf = Rf1 \u00d7 . . . \u00d7 Rfs .\nHowever, in the case of A -equivalences, the multigerm case does not in any\nobvious way reduce to the monogerm case.\nBy lemma 4, any stable multigerm F : (Rn , S) \u2192 (Rp , 0) with |S| = s < \u221e\n\n2\n\n\fadmits a decomposition\ns\nG\n\n\uf8eb\n\n!\n\n\u03c3i \u25e6 (fi \u00d7 idRp\u2212pi \u2212d ) \u00d7idRd : \uf8ed\n\ns\nG\n\n\uf8f6\nR\n\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\nni\n\n\u00d7\n\nY\n\nR\n\npj \uf8f8\n\nd\n\n\u00d7R \u2192\n\ns\nY\n\n!\nR\n\npi\n\n\u00d7Rd\n\ni=1\n\nj6=i\n\n(1)\nin suitably chosen coordinates, where the fi are ministable germs which are E K equivalent to the germs of F at points in S (see [9, p. 30]). If F is ministable,\nthen d will be 0. (In Rim\u00e1nyi's terminology, the fi will be roots of their kinds.)\nThere is a natural embedding of the product Af1 \u00d7 . . . \u00d7 Afs into AF , given\nby\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\ns\ns\nG\nY\n\u03b9 : ((\u03c61 , \u03c81 ), . . . , (\u03c6s , \u03c8s )) 7\u2192 \uf8ed \u03c3i \u25e6 (\u03c6i \u00d7\n\u03c8j ), (\u03c81 , . . . , \u03c8s )\uf8f8 , (2)\ni=1\n\nj=1j6=i\n\nwhere \u03c3i moves the first component to the ith . However, there is no guarantee\nthat this embedding is surjective. Suppose that there are two ways of decomposing F as in (1), and suppose for simplicity that d = 0. That is, there exist some\ndiffeomorphism germs \u03a6i , i = 1, . . . , s and \u03a8, such that the following commutes:\ns\nG\n\nR ni \u00d7\n\ni=1\n\nFs\n\ni=1\n\ns\nG\ni=1\n\n\u03a6i\n\n\u001f\u000f\u001f\nR ni\n\n\u001f\n\u001f\u001f\n\n\u001f\u001f\n\n\u001f\n\u001f\u001f\n\n\u001f\u001f\n\n\u001f\u001f\n\n\u001f\n\u001f\u001f\n\nY\n\nRp j\n\nFs\n\ni=1\n\n\u03c3i \u25e6(fi \u00d7id)\n\nj6=i\n\n/\n\ns\nY\n\nRp i\n\ni=1\n\n\u001f\n\u001f\u001f\n\nY\nj6=i\n\nRp j\n\nFs\n\ni=1 \u03c3i \u25e6(fi \u00d7id)\n\n/\n\ns\nY\n\n\u001f\u000f\u001f\n\n\u001f\n\u001f\u001f\n\n\u001f\u001f\n\n\u001f\u001f\n\n\u001f\u001f\n\u001f\u001f\u001f \u03a8\n\nRp i\n\ni=1\n\nGiven an element \u03b9 ((\u03c61 , \u03c81 ), . . . , (\u03c6s , \u03c8s )) \u2208 AF , there is no obvious guarantee that\n\uf8eb\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f6\ns\nG\nY\n\u03b1 = \uf8ed \u03a6i \u25e6 \uf8ed\u03c3i \u25e6 (\u03c6i \u00d7\n\u03c8j )\uf8f8 , \u03a8 \u25e6 (\u03c81 , . . . , \u03c8s )\uf8f8\ni=1\n\nj6=i\n\nis of the form on the right hand side of (2).

However,\nwe meet yet another problem \u2013 can we find coordinates that simultaneously give\n\n3\n\n\ff in the form (1) and linearize G? This problem might be solved by replacing\nG by the 1-jet of G, which is isomorphic to G \u2013 but j 1 G would not generally\nleave f invariant, and hence would not be a subgroup of Af .\nWe shall, indeed, see that for statements concerning maximal compact subgroups of Af , we can reduce to the monogerm case \u2013 but this is not trivial. For\nstatements concerning all of Af \u2013 in particular concerning the contractibility of\nthe quotient Af /M C(Af ) \u2013 we need to reprove the theorems for multigerms.\nWe shall also investigate a decomposition theorem for Af in terms of Rf and\na subgroup of L . Finally, we show that for a large class of multigerms f , the\nmaximal compact subgroups M C(Af ) are very simple.\nSome of the results presented in this article can be found in A. Feragen's\nPhD thesis [2], to which we refer for a higher level of detail.\n\n2\n\nPreliminaries and terminology\n\nWe denote by E (n) the ring of function germs (Rn , 0) \u2192 R, and denote by m(n)\nthe ideal in E (n) consisting of germs that map 0 to L\n0.

Since the Fi are unfoldings of the fi , the local algebras Q(Fi ) and Q(fi )\nare isomorphic, and as a consequence also the local algebras Q(F ) and Q(f ) are\nisomorphic [8, Theorem 2.1]. Hence F and f are K -equivalent. But F and f\nare also both stable, hence F and f are A -equivalent [4, Chapter III Theorem\n4.3].\n\n3\n\nGroups of multigerm equivalences\n\nSuppose given a multigerm f = f1 t f2 t . . . t fs as in (3). Recall that if R is\nthe group of diffeomorphism germs of a source component (Rn , 0), and L is the\ngroup of diffeomorphism germs of the target (Rp , 0), then A denotes the group\nof equivalences on the space of multigerms\nC \u221e ((Rn , 0) t . . . t (Rn , 0), (Rp , 0))\n\n(5)\n\ndefined by s R t L . We will write elements of A either in the form \u03c6 =\n(\u03c61 , . . . , \u03c6s , \u03c6t ) where the \u03c6i are the diffeomorphisms in question, or sometimes\nin the form \u03c8 = (\u03c81 , . . . , \u03c8s ) where \u03c8i = \u03c6i \u00d7 \u03c6t for each i. We use the latter\nnotation when we consider \u03c8 as an element in the group K , as defined below.\nNote that with this definition, the A -equivalences leave the source base points\nfixed.\nThe group K of equivalences on the space of multigerms (5) is the group of\ndiffeomorphism germs\n!\n!\nG\nG\nG\nG\nn\np\nn\np\nH:\nR \u00d7 R , (0, 0) \u2192\nR \u00d7 R , (0, 0)\nF\n\ns\n\ns\n\ns\n\ns\n\nsuch that the following diagram commutes:\nG\n(Rn , 0)\n\nid\u00d70\n\nG\n/\n\ns\n\n(Rn \u00d7 Rp , (0, 0))\n\nG\n/\n\ns\n\nH0\n\nH\n\n\u000f\nG\n(Rn , 0)\nid\u00d70\n\n/\n\nG\n\n(Rn , 0)\n\ns\n\nH0\n\ns\n\nprRn\n\n\u000f\n(R \u00d7 Rp , (0, 0))\nn\n\ns\n\nprRn\n\n/\n\nG\n\n\u000f\n(Rn , 0)\n\ns\n\nwhere H0 = H|Rn \u00d7 {0}. We F\nwill write elements of K in the form \u03c8 =\n(\u03c81 , . . . , \u03c8s ) where, in fact, \u03c8 = i \u03c8i . The group K acts on germs f in the\nfollowing way: H * f = g if (id, f ) \u25e6 H0 = H \u25e6 (id, g).\nGiven a multigerm f , we denote by Af or Kf the stabilizer of A or K at\nf ; namely\nHf = {\u03c8 \u2208 H : \u03c8 * f = f }\nfor H = A or K .\nFollowing the original definition by J\u00e4nich [6], we define a compact subgroup\nof A\nF to be a subgroup G of A which is conjugate in A to a compact subgroup\nof s GLn t GLp < A . The definition is reasonable: Suppose that G < A is\nisomorphic to some compact Lie group G\u0303, such that G\u0303 acts diffeomorphically on\n5\n\n\fRn tRp through the isomorphism G\u0303 \u2192 G, keeping the origins fixed (compare\nwith the definition of [10]). Then, in particular, G\u0303 acts diffeomorphically on each\nof the Rn and on Rp . By Bochner's theorem we can choose local coordinates\nin (Rn , 0), . . . , (Rn , 0) and (Rp , 0), respectively, given by diffeomorphism germs\n\u03c61 , . . . , \u03c6s and \u03c6t , with respect to which G acts linearly on the Rn and on Rp .\nThese define an element (\u03c61 , . . . , \u03c6s , \u03c6t ) of A , which linearizes G in A .\nBy analogy, we define a compact subgroup of K to be aFsubgroup G <\nK which is conjugate in K to a compact linear subgroup of s GLn \u00d7 GLp .\nThroughout the rest of the article, we let H denote A or K unless otherwise\nis specified.\nGiven a compact subgroup G of a group H of diffeomorphism-germs such\nas A , K or R, we say that G is a maximal compact subgroup of H if any other\ncompact subgroup H of H is conjugate in H to a subgroup of G.\nWe start out by making a few basic observations concerning the groups of\nA -equivalences and K -equivalences:\n\nF\n\ns\n\nLemma 6\ni) We have Af < Kf , so in particular M C(Af ) < M C(Kf ),\nassuming the maximal compact subgroups exist.\nii) Suppose that f : (Rn , 0) \u2192 (Rp , 0) is a monogerm, and consider A and\nK as groups acting on the source and target of f . Then K \u2229 GLn+p is a\nsubgroup of A , so in particular, Kf \u2229 GLn+p < Af .\nF\niii) Suppose that a multigerm f : s (Rn , 0) \u2192 (Rp , 0) is finitely k \u2212 H determined, and suppose that G < Hf is compact. Then we can find\nan element \u03c6 \u2208 H and a subgroup G\u0303 of H\u03c6*f such that \u03c6 * f is a polynomial of degree \u2264 k, and G\u0303 is a linear group which is conjugate (in H ) to\nG.\niv) F\nFor any compact subgroup G of H the restriction of the 1-jet map j 1 | : G \u2192\ns GLn \u00d7 GLp is injective.\nProof. Claim i) is trivial.\nii) An element H \u2208 K is an element of A if it can be decomposed as H =\nH1 \u00d7 H2 , where H1 : (Rn , 0) \u2192 (Rn , 0) and H2 : (Rp , 0) \u2192 (Rp , 0). Since\nH \u2208 K , we know that H(Rn , 0) \u2282 (Rn , 0), so we set H1 = H|(Rn , 0)\u00d7{0}.\nSince H is a linear diffeomorphism, H(a) \u2208 H1 for some a \u2208 (Rn+p , 0)\nimplies a \u2208 H1 . Then we must have H(b) \u2208 H1\u22a5 = {0} \u00d7 (Rp , 0) :=\nH2 , for all b \u2208 {0} \u00d7 (Rp , 0), since otherwise, we would find a = b \u2212\nH \u22121 (prH2 (H(b))) \u2208\n/ H1 with H(a) \u2208 H1 .\niii) Since G < Hf is compact, we can find \u03c8 \u2208 H such that \u03c8G\u03c8 \u22121 is\nlinear, by definition. Now G\u0303 = \u03c8G\u03c8 \u22121 < H\u03c8*f , and since f is k \u2212\nH -determined, so is \u03c8 * f . In particular, \u03c8 * f is H -equivalent to the\npolynomial representative p of its k-jet j k (\u03c8 * f ), by an element \u03c8\u0303 \u2208 H ,\nsay:\np = \u03c8\u0303 * \u03c8 * f.\nWe claim that G\u0303 < Hp . Since the linear group G\u0303 leaves \u03c8 * f invariant,\nit certainly leaves the jet j k (\u03c8 * f ) invariant in J k (n, p). But then it must\nleave p invariant, since then, for any g \u2208 G\u0303, the map g * p is a degree k\npolynomial representing j k (\u03c8 * f ). Set \u03c6 = \u03c8\u0303 * \u03c8, and we are done.\n6\n\n\fiv) By the definition\nof a compact subgroup, there exists a choice of coordiF\nnates on s Rn \u00d7 Rp such that G acts linearly;\nnow in these coordinates\nF\nthe 1-jet map is just the inclusion into s GLn \u00d7 GLp . The topological\nproperties of the map j 1 do not depend on the choice of coordinates; hence\nj 1 |G is injective.\n\u0003\n\n3.1\n\nMaximal compact subgroups\n\nNow we are ready to state and prove the main theorem of the section.\nTheorem 7 Let f be a finitely H -determined multigerm as in (3). The group\nHf has a maximal compact subgroup, which is unique up to conjugation in Hf .\nThe monogerm version of this theorem was proven by J\u00e4nich [6] (for H = R)\nand Wall [15] (for H = A or K ) with some completing comments by du Plessis\nand Wilson [10, p. 270], who proved similar results for actions of R, but without\nfinite R-determinacy.\nProof. Just like in the monogerm case we will need an equivariant finite determinacy condition, as formulated in the lemma below. The proof of the lemma\nfollows the standard proof of k-determinacy [7], using vector fields \u2013 but averaging the vector fields over the group G using the Haar integral.\nF\nLemma 8 Let f : s (Rn , 0) \u2192 (Rp , 0) be k \u2212 H -determined, and suppose that\nG is a compact linear subgroup of Hf . Then f is k \u2212 G-determined; that is, if\nF\nf \u0303: s (Rn , 0) \u2192 (Rp , 0) is G-invariant such that j k f = j k f \u0303, then there exists\n\u03c6 \u2208 H such that \u03c6 * g = g * \u03c6 for all g \u2208 G, and f \u0303 = \u03c6 * f . In particular,\nG < Hf \u0303, since g * f \u0303 = g * \u03c6 * f = \u03c6 * g * f = \u03c6 * f = f \u0303 for all g \u2208 G.\nAssume that f is k \u2212 H -determined. We write H k for the families of\ninvertible k-jets\n!\n!\nG\nG\nG\nG\n\u03c6k = (\u03c6k1 , . . . , \u03c6ks ) :\nR n \u00d7 Rp , 0 \u2192\nRn \u00d7 Rp , 0 , \u03c6 \u2208 H ,\ns\n\ns\n\ns\n\ns\n\nand write Hfk for the subgroup stabilizing j k f ; both these groups are real\nalgebraic.\nReal algebraic groups have finitely many components, so we may apply Iwasawa's theorem [5, p. 180] and choose a maximal compact subgroup G of Hfk .\nFollowing the arguments of J\u00e4nich [6, \u00a72] and Bochner [1] we can linearize G in\nthe following ways:\nLemma 9\ni) Suppose that G < H kFis a compact subgroup. Then there\nexists \u03c6 \u2208 H k such that \u03c6G\u03c6\u22121 < s GLn \u00d7 GLp .\nii) Suppose that G < HF is a compact subgroup. Then there exists \u03c6 \u2208 H\nsuch\nthat \u03c6G\u03c6\u22121 < s GLn \u00d7 GLp . Suppose, furthermore, that j k G <\nF\nk\nk\nGL\nn \u00d7 GLp < H . Then we may assume that j \u03c6 = (1, . . . , 1).\ns\nWe return to the proof of theorem 7, and to the maximal compact subgroup\nG of Hfk .\n7\n\n\fF\nDenote G0 = \u03c6G\u03c6\u22121 < s GLn \u00d7 GLp . By abuse of notation, we will also\ndenote by G0 the corresponding linear subgroup of H k . Let \u03c6\u0303 \u2208 H such that\nj k \u03c6\u0303 = \u03c6. Then if f0 = \u03c6\u0303 * f , its jet j k f0 is G0 -invariant, and G0 is maximal\ncompact in Hfk0 .\nLet H be any compact subgroup of Hf0 . By classical Lie group theory j k H is\nconjugate in Hfk0 to a subgroup of G0 , say by a family of jets of diffeomorphisms\n\u03c8 k = (\u03c81k , . . . , \u03c8sk ). Let \u03c8\u0303 be a family of diffeomorphisms (\u03c8\u03031 , . . . , \u03c8\u0303s ) with jet\n\u03c8 k . Then the k-jet of \u03c8\u0303H \u03c8\u0303 \u22121 is linear.\nBy lemma 9, we can find \u03c8 = (\u03c81 , . . . , \u03c8s ) with the same k-jet as \u03c8\u0303, such\nthat \u03c8H\u03c8 \u22121 is linear. Hence f \u0303 = \u03c8 * f0 is (\u03c8H\u03c8 \u22121 )-invariant, just like f0\n(because \u03c8H\u03c8 \u22121 < G0 ). Since j k \u03c8 = j k \u03c8\u0303 = \u03c8 k \u2208 Hfk0 , we have j k f \u0303 = j k f0 .\nRecall that f0 is k \u2212 (\u03c8H\u03c8 \u22121 )-determined, so by lemma 8 there exists some\n(\u03c8H\u03c8 \u22121 )-equivariant family of diffeomorphisms \u03b1 = (\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1s ) \u2208 H such\nthat f0 = \u03b1 * f \u0303. Hence f0 = (\u03b1\u03c8) * f0 , and so \u03b1\u03c8 preserves f0 and conjugates\nH to\n\u03b1 \u03c8H\u03c8 \u22121 \u03b1\u22121 = \u03c8H\u03c8 \u22121 < G0\n| {z }\n<G0\n\nwhere the last equality holds because \u03b1 is G0 -equivariant.\nWe have seen that G0 can be viewed as a compact subgroup of Hf0 , and\nthat any other compact subgroup H of Hf0 is conjugate to a subgroup of G0 ,\nso conjugating back to Hf , we see that theorem 7 holds.\n\n3.2\n\nContractibility of quotients\n\nFollowing J\u00e4nich [6], we define what it means for Af /M C(Af ) to be contractible. We have not specified a topology on Af /M C(Af ), and in fact we\nshall define contractibility not in terms of the topology of Af /M C(Af ) as a\nspace of its own, but through the topological properties of its action on the\nsource and target of f .\nBefore defining contractibility, we define what it means for a map into a\nquotient Af /G to be smooth. Let G be a subgroup of A . Given a smooth\nmanifold M , possibly with boundary, we say that a map q : M \u2192 A /G is\nsmooth if there exists an open covering\n{Ui } of\nF\nFM such that q is represented by\nfibered (over Ui ) maps \u03c6i : Ui \u00d7 s Rn \u2192 Ui \u00d7 s Rn and \u03c8i : Ui \u00d7Rp \u2192 Ui \u00d7Rp ,\nwhich are diffeomorphisms.\nEquivalently, a map \u03b1 : M \u2192 A /G is smooth if there exists an open covering {Ui }i\u2208I of M such that \u03b1 admits a local lift \u03b1\u0303i : Ui \u2192 A , where the\ncorresponding fibered map-germs \u03c6i and \u03c8i are smooth.\nDefinition 10 Let G be a subgroup of Af . The quotient Af /G is contractible\nif for every smooth manifold M with boundary, any smooth map \u2202M \u2192 Af /G\ncan be extended to a smooth map M \u2192 Af /G.\nWe proceed to state and prove the main result of the section:\nTheorem 11 Suppose given a finitely A -determined multigerm\nf=\n\ns\nG\ni=1\n\nfi :\n\ns\nG\n\n(Rn , 0) \u2192 (Rp , 0).\n\ni=1\n\nThen the quotient Af /M C(Af ) is contractible.\n8\n\n\fThis proof follows that of Rim\u00e1nyi [11] for the monogerm case.\nProof.

But we have\nF (\u03a8 ((u, x, 0), 1)) = \u03a6 (F (u, x, 0), 1)\nby (14), and \u03a6 (F (u,\u0010x,\u00100), 1) = \u03a6(g(u, x), 0, 1) by\u0011 the\u0011 definition of F , while\nF (\u03a8 ((u, x, 0), 1)) = h prM \u00d7Fs Rn (\u03a8((u, x, 0), 1)) , 1 , also by the definition\nof F , so h(\u03a8\u0303(u, x, 1)) = prM \u00d7Rp (F (\u03a8((u, x, 0), 1))) = prM \u00d7Rp (\u03a6(g(u, x), 0, 1)) =\n\u03a6\u0303(g(u, x), 1), and (16) holds.\nIn particular, \u03a6\u0303\u22121\n\u25e6 \u03a8\u03031 = h\u03031 = g, and thus \u03a8\u03031 and \u03a6\u03031 are the conjugating\n1 \u25e6 hF\ndiffeomorphisms sought \u03c8 k and \u03c6.\nSuppose that we are given map germs\nX k : (M \u00d7 Rn \u00d7 R, M \u00d7 0 \u00d7 R) \u2192 (Rn , 0) (k = 1, . . . , s),\nY : (M \u00d7 Rp \u00d7 R, M \u00d7 0 \u00d7 R) \u2192 (Rp , 0),\nsuch that the following conditions (17) \u2013 (20) hold:\nn\nX\n\u2202Fyj\ni=1\n\n\u2202xi\n\n(u, xk , t)Xik (u, xk , t) +\n\n\u2202Fyj\n(u, xk , t) = Yj (F (u, xk , t))\n\u2202t\n\n(17)\n\nfor all j = 1, . . . , p, and k = 1, . . . , s;\nX k |M \u00d7 0 \u00d7 R = 0 (k = 1, . . . , s);\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\n\u2202X k\n\u2202xi (u, 0, t)\n\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\n\u2202Y\n\u2202yj (u, 0, t)\n\n= 0 for all i = 1, . . . , n,\n\nY |M \u00d7 0 \u00d7 R = 0;\n\n(18)\n\n(k = 1, . . . , s);\n(19)\n\n= 0 for all j = 1, . . . , p;\n10\n\n\fX k |\u2202M \u00d7 Rn \u00d7 R = 0;\n\nY |\u2202M \u00d7 Rp \u00d7 R = 0.\n\n(20)\n\nConsider the flows of the following vector fields:\nX\u0303 k : M \u00d7 Rn \u00d7 R \u2192 T M \u00d7 T Rn \u00d7 T R, (u, xk , t) 7\u2192 (0, X(u, xk , t), 1),\n\u1ef8 : M \u00d7 Rp \u00d7 R 7\u2192 T M \u00d7 T Rp \u00d7 T R,\n(u, y, t) 7\u2192 (0, Y (u, y, t), 1).\nBy (18), these flows exist at least in a neighborhood of M \u00d7 0 \u00d7 R.

Hence, the proof of proposition 12 is completed by finding\nthe vector fields X k and Y . This construction is quite long and technical, but\nfollows the construction by Rimanyi for the monogerm case [12]. We refer to\nthe thesis [2] for details.\nWe may now return to the proof of theorem 11.\nDenote by A l the Lie group of l-jets of elements of A and set\nAfl = {(z1 , . . . , zs , zt ) \u2208 A l |zt \u25e6 j l f \u25e6 (z1 t . . . t zs )\u22121 = j l f }.\nFor a sufficiently large l \u2208 N, the image of a maximal compact subgroup of\nAf under j l is a maximal compact subgroup of Afl . This is a consequence of\nthe apparently more general:\nLemma 21 For f finitely A -determined and l sufficiently large, any maximal\ncompact subgroup G of Afl is the image under j l of a maximal compact subgroup\nG\u0303 of Af .\nProof. Let G < Afl be a maximal compact subgroup. Up to conjugation by\nsome element \u03c6l \u2208 A l , G is linear, i.e., \u03c6l G(\u03c6l )\u22121 \u2261 G\u03c6 is a linear maximal\nl\nsubgroup of (A l )\u03c6l *f l = A\u03c6*f\n. But then G\u03c6 (as a matrix group) is a subgroup\nof Ap(\u03c6*f ) , where p(\u03c6 * f ) is the lth degree polynomial map representing \u03c6 * f .\nFor l sufficiently large, p(\u03c6 * f ) is A -equivalent to \u03c6 * f via some element \u03c8 \u2208 A :\n\u03c6 * f = \u03c8 * p(\u03c6 * f ).\nl\nWe must have \u03c8 l := j l \u03c8 \u2208 A\u03c6*f\n, since j l (\u03c6 * f ) = j l \u03c8 * j l (p(\u03c6 * f )) =\nj l \u03c8 * j l (\u03c6 * f ). That is, G\u03c6\u03c8 \u2261 \u03c8G\u03c6 \u03c8 \u22121 is a compact subgroup of A\u03c6*f such that\nl\nl\nj l G\u03c6\u03c8 = \u03c8 l g\u03c6 (\u03c8 l )\u22121 is a maximal compact subgroup of A\u03c6*f\n, where G\u03c6 < A\u03c6*f\nl\n\u22121 l\n\u22121 \u22121\nis conjugate in A to G via (\u03c6 ) . But then, if G\u0303 = \u03c6 \u03c8 G\u03c6\u03c8 \u03c8\u03c6, G\u0303 is a\nmaximal compact subgroup of Af and we have\nj l G\u0303 = (\u03c6l )\u22121 (\u03c8 l )\u22121 \u03c8 l \u03c6l G(\u03c6l )\u22121 (\u03c8 l )\u22121 \u03c8 l \u03c6l = G.\n\n\u0003\n\nLet G be a maximal compact subgroup of Af . By replacing f by a suitably\nchosen representative of its A -equivalence class, we may assume that G acts\nlinearly.

J\u00e4nich [6] and Rim\u00e1nyi [12] claim the existence of a lift \u03b1\u0303 as a consequence of a section \u03c3 : Af /G \u2192 Af lifted from the section \u03c3 l : Afl /G \u2192 Afl ,\nwhich exists because Afl /G is contractible. See the diagram (23) below. We take\nthe time to explain how such a lift is constructed. Associated with the section \u03c3 l\nis a map \u03c4 : Afl \u2192 G such that \u03c3 l \u25e6 \u03c0 l (\u03b1) = \u03c4 (\u03b1) * \u03b1 for all \u03b1 \u2208 Afl .

Since Afl /G\nis contractible, we can construct an extension \u03b2\u0304 : M \u2192 Afl /G. Composing with\nthe section \u03c3 l , we obtain a map \u03b3 : M \u2192 Afl /G \u2192 Afl .\nLemma 24 There exists a smooth map \u03b4 : \u2202M \u2192 G such that j l \u25e6(\u03b4 * \u03b1\u0303) : \u2202M \u2192\nAfl coincides with \u03b3|\u2202M .\nProof.

Thus (25) is true, and this\nconcludes the proof of lemma 24.\nBy lemma 24 we see that replacing the old map \u03b1\u0303 by \u03b4 * \u03b1\u0303, we may assume\n \u0304 : M \u2192 A which\nthat j l \u25e6 \u03b1\u0303 = \u03b3|\u2202M . This will enable us to construct a map \u1fb1\nl\nextends \u03b1\u0303. Without the assumption j \u25e6 \u03b1\u0303 = \u03b3|\u2202M we risk \u2013 for instance, if\nM = [0, 1] \u2013 that j l (\u03b1\u0303(0)) and j l (\u03b1\u0303(1)) end up in different components of Afl ,\nin which case an extension of \u03b1\u0303 is impossible. This, however, is not crucial in\norder to get the map into Af /G.\nAs a first step, we construct a map \u03b10 : M \u2192 Aj l f = {\u03c6 \u2208 A |j l \u03c6 \u2208 Afl },\n\u03b1\nextending \u03b1\u0303, and in particular such that \u03c0Ajl f \u25e6 \u03b10 extends our map \u2202M \u2192\nAf /G \u2192 Aj l f /G, where the second map is induced by the inclusion, and such\nthat j l \u03b10 = \u03b3.\nIn order to do this, we must construct diffeomorphism germs at M \u00d7 {0}:\nFs\nF\nF\nF\nF\nF1 = k=1 F1k : ( s M \u00d7 Rn , s M \u00d7 0) \u2192 ( s M \u00d7 Rn , s M \u00d7 0)\nF2 : (M \u00d7 Rp , M \u00d7 0) \u2192 (M \u00d7 Rp , M \u00d7 0)\nF\nfrom given germs in \u2202M \u00d7 s Rn and \u2202M \u00d7 Rp , and where the l-jets are given\neverywhere.\nWe go through the construction for one of the F1k ; the proof for F2 is similar.\nIf we can find F1k locally, then we get a global solution by using a partition of\nunity to add the solutions together fiberwise. This gives a diffeomorphism germ\nsince the l-jet, and thus in particular the differential DF1k , is fixed everywhere.\nAt points in the interior of M , we can just define the local F1k by taking the\nth\nl degree polynomial representative of the given jet. Near points in \u2202M , we\nconstruct the component functions of the local F1k in the following way:\nGiven a polynomial P of degree l in the variables x1 , . . . , xn with coefficients from the ring E (r) of smooth functions in r variables, and a smooth\nfunction p0 : Rr\u22121+n \u2192 R such that jxl p0 = P (0, u2 , . . . , ur , x1 , . . . , xn ), (here\nthe coordinates of Rn are denoted by xi and the local coordinates of M are\ndenoted by uj , where \u2202M is given by u1 = 0) we construct a smooth function\np : Rr+n \u2192 R such that p|{u1 = 0} = p0 , and jxl p = P (u1 , . . . , ur , x1 , . . . , xn ).\nOne function which satisfies all of the above, is the combination p(u, x) =\np0 (u2 , . . . , ur , x) \u2212 P (0, u2 , . . . , ur , x) + P (u1 , . . . , ur , x).\nIt follows that the map \u03b10 : M \u2192 Aj l f exists, and it is represented by the\nproduct F = (F11 , . . . F1s , F2 ). We use it to construct the extension sought\n\u1fb1 : M \u2192 Af /G:\n13\n\n\fWe compare the maps\n\u03c6\u03bd : M \u00d7\n\nG\n\nRn \u2192 M \u00d7 Rp\n\n\u03bd = 1, 2\n\ns\n\ngiven by\n\u03c61 : (u, x) 7\u2192 (u, (\u03b10 (u) * f )(x)) ,\n\u03c62 : (u, x) 7\u2192 (u, f (x)) .\nF\nThese two maps coincide on \u2202M \u00d7 s Rn , and their l-jets coincide at each\nM -level, thus we can apply proposition 12 to find a smooth map \u03c8 : M \u2192 A\nsuch that \u03c8 * \u03c61 = \u03c62 , j 1 \u03c8 = id and such that \u03c8|\u2202M = id. Now the map\n \u0304 : M \u2192 Af , \u1fb1\n \u0304 = \u03c8 * \u03b10 , is an extension of \u03b1\u0303 and j l \u1fb1\n \u0304 = \u03b3 (because j 1 \u03c8 = id).\n\u1fb1\n \u0304 : M \u2192 Af /G of \u03b1.\nMost importantly, it defines an extension \u1fb1 = \u03c0 \u25e6 \u1fb1\nFrom the proof of theorem 11, we see that the following corollary also holds:\nCorollary 26 Suppose that G is a maximal compact subgroup of Af .

The monogerms\nstudied in [10] are critical normalizations, a class of germs which contains all\nstable map-germs, finitely A -determined germs with p \u2265 3 and \u03a3(f ) 6= {0},\nand all analytic, topologically stable map-germs. We are interested in [10, Theorem 1.5], which says that if f is a finitely A -determined critical normalization,\n \u0303\nthen a certain subgroup, Inv(D),\nof the target diffeomorphisms which preserve\nthe discriminant, admits a maximal compact subgroup G. Moreover, the natural\nsequence\n0 \u2192 M C(Rf ) \u2192 M C(Af ) \u2192 G \u2192 0\n(32)\nshould be split exact. As a consequence, the maximal compact subgroup M C(Af )\nshould be the direct sum of M C(Rf ) and G. However, a closer inspection revealed a problem with the proof of the monogerm version from [10].\nOur goal is to prove the following conjecture, generalizing the claim by du\nPlessis and Wilson to multigerms:\nConjecture 33 Let f be a finitely A -determined multigerm which is also a\n \u0303\ncritical normalization. The group Inv(D(f\n)) admits a maximal compact subgroup G, which is unique up to conjugation. Moreover, the sequence\np\n\ni\n\n0 \u2192 M C(Rf ) \u2192 M C(Af ) \u2192 G \u2192 0\nis split exact, so that M C(Af ) = M C(Rf ) \u2295 G.\n17\n\n(34)\n\n\fIn this section we shall discuss why the original proof of the monogerm\nversion of the conjecture does not hold. Moreover, we shall see just how close\nto the result sought we can get with tactics similar to those in [10].\nThe proof of [10, Theorem 1.5] rests on the assumption that linearizability\nis preserved under conjugation by any element of A , but unfortunately, this\nis not true. More precisely, the problem is found in the following sentence in\n \u0303\n \u0303\n[10, lines 2-4, page 270]: \"... l conjugates Inv(D(f\n)) onto Inv(D(g))\nand conjugates compact Lie subgroups to compact Lie subgroups, preserving conjugates\nand preserving linearizability.\" Here, (r, l) is an arbitrary element of A , and\n \u0303\nlinearizability of a compact Lie subgroup H of Inv(D(f\n)) means that for some\n \u0303l \u2208 Inv(D(f\n \u0303\n)) with j 1  \u0303l = id,  \u0303lH  \u0303l\u22121 is linear. However, this statement does not\ngenerally hold:\nProposition 35 For a general element (r, l) \u2208 A , the conjugate group lHl\u22121\nis not generally linearizable.\nProof. To see this, consider the following linearizable diffeomorphism germ \u03c6:\n\u03c6\n\n(Rp , 0)\n\u001f\n\u001f\u001f\u001f\n\u001f\n\u03c8 \u001f\u001f\n\u001f\u001f\n\u001f\u000f\n(Rp , 0)\np\n\nT0 \u03c6\n\n/ (Rp , 0)\n\u001f\n\u001f\u001f\u001f\n\u001f\u001f \u03c8\n\u001f\u001f\u001f\n\u001f\u000f\n/ (Rp , 0)\n\np\n\nand suppose that l : (R , 0) \u2192 (R , 0) is another diffeomorphism-germ. The\n \u0303\nquestion now is, whether we can find a diffeomorphism-germ \u03c8\u0303 \u2208 Inv(D(f\n))\nsuch that T0 \u03c8\u0303 = id and the following diagram commutes?\n(Rp , 0)\n\u001f\u001f\n\u001f\u001f\u001f\n\u03c8\u0303 \u001f\u001f\n\u001f\n\u001f\u000f\u001f\n(Rp , 0)\n\nl\u03c6l\u22121\n\nT0 (l\u03c6l\n\n/ (Rp , 0)\n\u001f\u001f\n\u001f\u001f\u001f\n\u001f\u001f \u03c8\u0303\n\u001f\u001f\u001f\n\u000f\n/ (Rp , 0)\n\u22121\n)\n\nDecomposing the diagram, we get\n(Rp , 0)\n\u001f\u001f\n\u001f\u001f\u001f\nT0 l\u25e6\u03c8\u25e6l\u22121 \u001f\u001f\n\u001f\n\u001f\u000f\u001f\n(Rp , 0)\n\nl\u22121\n\nT0 l\n\n/ (Rp , 0)\n\u001f\u001f\n\u001f\u001f\u001f\n\u03c8 \u001f\u001f\n\u001f\n\u001f\u000f\u001f\n/ (Rp , 0)\n\u22121\n\n\u03c6\n\nT0 \u03c6\n\n/ (Rp , 0)\n\u001f\u001f\n\u001f\u001f\u001f\n\u001f\u03c8\n\u001f\u001f\u001f\n\u001f\u000f\n/ (Rp , 0)\n\n/ (Rp , 0)\n\u001f\u001f\n\u001f\u001f\u001f\nT0 l\u25e6\u03c8\u25e6l\u22121 \u001f\u001f\n\u001f\n\u001f\u000f\u001f\n/ (Rp , 0)\nl\n\nT0 l\n\ngiving \u03c8\u0303 = T0 l \u25e6 \u03c8 \u25e6 l\u22121 . It is easy to see that T0 \u03c8\u0303 = id, but we also need\n \u0303\n\u03c8\u0303 to belong to Inv(D(f\n)). In particular, we need \u03c8\u0303(D(f )) = D(f ). Since\nl and \u03c8 both belong to Inv(D(f )), we have \u03c8(l\u22121 (D(f )) = D(f ). However,\n\u03c8\u0303(D(f )) = T0 l(\u03c8(l\u22121 (D(f )))) = T0 l(D(f )), which equals D(f ) if and only if\nD(f ) = T0 D(f ), but this is not generally the case. It follows that linearizability\nis not preserved under conjugation.\n18\n\n\fAs a consequence of proposition 35, the proof of [10, Theorem 1.5] does not\nhold.\n \u0303\nThe linearizability is used in [10] to relate compact subgroups of Inv(D(f\n)) to\ncompact subgroups of Af . Let us temporarily assume that there is an alternative\nway to do this. We can prove:\nProposition 36 Let f be a multigerm as in conjecture 33. Suppose that for any\n \u0303\nlinear compact subgroup H0 of Inv(D(f\n)), we can find a compact subgroup G\u0303 of\nAf such that p(G\u0303) \u2283 H. Then p(M C(Af )) is a maximal compact subgroup of\n \u0303\nInv(D(f\n)), and the sequence (32) is split exact, so that M C(Af ) = M C(Rf ) \u2295\np(M C(Af )).\nProof. The following lemma holds, even for multigerms, with a proof similar\nto that in [10]:\nF\nF\nLemma 37 Let f = s fi : s (Rn , 0) \u2192 (Rp , 0) be a CN. Then the sequence\ni\n\np\n\n \u0303\n1 \u2192 Rf \u2192 Af \u2192 Inv(D)\n\u21921\n\n(38)\n\nis well-defined and exact, where i(r) = (r, id) and p(r, l) = l.\nIf f is a finitely A -determined multigerm, we know by theorem 7 that\nM C(Af ) exists and is unique up to conjugation in Af . Just as in [10], also\nM C(Rf ) exists and is unique up to conjugation in Rf . Moreover, the sequence\np\n\ni\n\n1 \u2192 M C(Rf ) \u2192 M C(Af ) \u2192 p(M C(Af )) \u2192 1\nis split exact, where p : A \u2192 L . It is clear that p(M C(Af )) is a compact subgroup of Inv(D); what we would like to prove is that p(M C(Af )) is a maximal\n \u0303\ncompact subgroup of Inv(D),\nunique up to conjugation.\nLet G be a maximal compact subgroup of Af , and note that if we can prove\nthe result with f replaced by an A -equivalent germ f0 , then the result holds\nalso for f .\n \u0303\nPick a compact subgroup H of Inv(D).\nWe would like to show that p(G)\n \u0303\nis a maximal compact subgroup of Inv(D)\nby showing that H is conjugate in\n \u0303\nInv(D)\nto a subgroup of p(G). Choose a germ f0 = \u03b1 * f which is A -equivalent\nto f , where \u03b1 = (r1 , . . . , rs , l) \u2208 A , such that H0 = lHl\u22121 is linear. By abuse\nof notation, we identify H0 with j k H0 for any k.\nIf we can find a maximal compact subgroup G\u0303 of Af0 such that H0 \u2282 p(G\u0303),\nthen we can prove the result as follows: Since G\u0303 and G are maximal compact\nsubgroups of Af0 and Af , respectively, there exists some g = (r\u03031 , . . . , r\u0303s ,  \u0303l) \u2208\nAf0 such that g G\u0303g \u22121 = G, and p(G) = p(g G\u0303g \u22121 ) =  \u0303lp(G\u0303) \u0303l\u22121 . Moreover,\n \u0303l \u2208 Inv(D(f\n \u0303\n \u0303\u22121 , so H0 is conjugate to a\n \u0303\n0 )) since g \u2208 Af0 , and p(G) = lp(G\u0303)l\n \u0303\nsubgroup of p(G) via l. But then H is conjugate to a subgroup of p(G) via  \u0303ll.\nWe are thus left with the problem of lifting the group H0 to a compact group\nG\u0303 < Af0 . Let us attack the problem on the jet level.\nProposition 39 Let f be as in conjecture 33, and let H0 be a compact, linear\n \u0303\nsubgroup of Inv(D(f\n0 )). For any r \u2208 N0 , we can find a compact group G\u0303 < Af\n0\n\nsuch that j r pG\u0303 = H0 .\n19\n\n\fProof. Since H0 acts linearly, we have H0 = j k H0 for any k \u2265 1, and by the\narguments above, H0 \u2282 Im(j k p), where p : Af \u2192 L. By [10, Corollary 4.4], if\nh : H \u2192 H 0 is a surjective homomorphism of real algebraic groups, then every\ncompact subgroup of H 0 is the image under h of a compact subgroup of H.\nHence, there exists a compact subgroup G0 of Ajkk f0 such that j k p(G0 ) = H0 .\nWe would like to find a corresponding subgroup on the map level, namely\na subgroup G\u03030 of Af0 with j k G\u03030 = G0 and p(G\u03030 ) \u2283 H0 . By Bochner's linearization theorem, we may (by changing source coordinates) assume that G0\nacts linearly, while we still have j k p(G0 ) = H0 . Let f 0 denote the polynomial\nrepresentative of j k f . Since G0 acts linearly, we must also have G0 < Af 0 .\nSince f 0 has the same k-jet as f0 , and these maps are finitely A -determined, we\nhave that for sufficiently large k, there exists \u03b2 = (\u03c61 , . . . , \u03c6s , \u03c8) \u2208 A such that\n \u0303\nf0 = \u03b2 * f 0 . Since G0 < Af 0 , we have \u03b2G0 \u03b2 \u22121 < Af0 . We had H0 < Inv(D(f\n0 )),\n\u22121\n \u0303\nand now we must also have \u03c8H0 \u03c8 < Inv(D(f )).\nAs pointed out in [7, Addendum to 3.5], f0 is actually k \u2212 Ar -determined\nfor any r with k sufficiently large. Hence, we may assume that j r \u03c8 = id for any\nr, and for sufficiently large k (depending on r). Thus there exist, for any r \u2208 N,\na k \u001d 0 and a \u03b2 = (\u03c61 , . . . , \u03c6s , \u03c8) such that the compact group G\u0303 = \u03b2G0 \u03b2 \u22121 <\nAf0 satisfies j k p(G\u0303) = j k (\u03c8H0 \u03c8 \u22121 ) = H0 . We may assume r \u2264 k, so j r p(G\u0303)H0 ,\n \u0303\nand we have j r p(G\u0303) = j r \u03c8H0 (j r \u03c8)\u22121 < Inv(D(f\n0 )).\nThis shows that on the jet level, we can get arbitrarily close to the lifting of\nH0 . Unfortunately, this is not immediately enough to get a lifting of H0 to Af0 ,\nbut leaves us with the following conjecture, which will be considered further in\na forthcoming paper:\nConjecture 40 There exists a compact subgroup G\u0303 of Af such that p(G\u0303) \u2283 H0 .\nIf this conjecure holds, then by the argument above, so does conjecture 33.\n\n4.3\n\nMaximal compact subgroups are often small\n\nRecall from lemma 6 that Af is a subgroup of Kf , so the size of Kf is an\nupper bound for the size of Af . In this section we prove that Kf is very small\nfor finitely determined rank 0 germs, making it easy to compute. Since we\nhave shown that maximal compact subgroups of Kf for multigerms f can be\ndecomposed as a product of maximal compact subgroups for the corresponding\nmonogerms, the monogerm results carry directly over to multigerms.\nTheorem 41 Let f : (Rn , 0) \u2192 (Rp , 0) be finitely K -determined, with p < n\nand T0 f \u2261 0. If p > 1, or if p = 1 and j 2 f = 0, then M C(Kf ) is \u2264 1dimensional, and if p = 1 then it is 0-dimensional.\nFor p = 1, this is related to a theorem by P. Slodowy:\nTheorem 42 [14, Satz p. 169] Let f : (Rn , 0) \u2192 (R, 0) be a germ such that\nj 2 f = 0 and f is finitely R-determined. If a compact group G acts faithfully\nand linearly on Rn , leaving f invariant, then G is zero-dimensional.\nRemark 43 By [16, Theorem 4.6.1], any K -finitely determined function germ\nis R-finitely determined.\n\n20\n\n\fCorollary 44 Let f be as in theorem 41 with p = 1, and let G < Rf be a\ncompact subgroup. Then G is zero-dimensional.\nTheorem 45 Let f be as in theorem 41 with p = 1, and let G < Kf be a\ncompact subgroup. Then G is zero-dimensional.\nProof. Changing f by a K -equivalence, we may assume that G acts linearly\nby lemma 6. Note furthermore that changing f by a K -equivalence will not\nchange the fact that j 2 f = 0.\nLinear subgroups of K lie in A by lemma 6; hence we can assume G <\nGLn \u00d7 GL1 = GLn \u00d7 R\u2217 . The projections from GLn \u00d7 R\u2217 onto GLn and R\u2217 are\ncontinuous homomorphisms, and take G to compact subgroups G\u0303 < GLn and\nGR < R\u2217 , respectively. Since GR is a compact subgroup of R\u2217 , we must have\nGR < {\u00b11}.\nHaving this in mind, we see that G\u0303 splits into two parts, namely\nG\u0303 \u2229 Rf\n\nand H = {g \u2208 G\u0303|g * f = \u2212f }.\n\nThe group G\u0303 \u2229 Rf is finite by theorem 42, but what about H?\nSince G\u0303 is a Lie group, we must either have G\u0303 discrete, or G\u0303\u2229Rf \u2282 \u2202G\u0303 H with\ndim H \u2265 1. Suppose the latter. Then we can form a continuous path \u03b3 : I \u2192 G\u0303\nt\u21920\nsuch that \u03b3(0) \u2208 Rf \u2229 \u2202G\u0303 H and \u03b3(t) \u2208 H for t 6= 0. Then we have \u03b3(t) \u2192 \u03b3(0),\nt\u21920\n\nand for any given x \u2208 (Rn , 0) we have f (\u03b3(t)(x)) \u2192 f (\u03b3(0)(x)), since G is a\nmatrix group. But by the definitions of H and Rf , we have f (\u03b3(t)(x)) = \u2212f (x)\nwhen t 6= 0, while f (\u03b3(0)(x)) = f (x), so unless f (x) = 0, this must be false. We\nhave f (x) 6= 0 for x arbitrarily close to 0 \u2208 Rn , and hence we cannot find such a\npath \u03b3. But then G\u0303 must be discrete. Being a compact discrete set, G\u0303 is finite.\nFor p \u2265 2, C.T.C. Wall has proven an analogous result over the complex\nnumbers:\nTheorem 46 [15, Theorem 3.3] Let f : (Cn , 0) \u2192 (Cp , 0) have finite singularity\ntype, 1 < p < n, and T0 f \u2261 0. Then\ndim Gf \u2264 1,\nwhere Gf is a maximal complex reductive subgroup of Kf .\nWe shall pass from Wall's result to the corresponding claim over the real\nnumbers from theorem 41.\nProof (of theorem 41). Denote G = M C(Kf ) for short. By lemma 6, we\nmay assume, up to a change of coordinates, that f is a polynomial and that G\nis linear. In particular,\nG < Kf \u2229 (GLn \u00d7 GLp ) < Af\nby lemma 6.\nThere is a corresponding complex polynomial\nfC : (Cn , 0) \u2192 (Cp , 0)\n\n21\n\n\fwith the same (real) coefficients as f . Then fC is finitely K -determined as well\n[16, Proposition 1.7], hence has FST.\nViewing G as a subgroup of\nGL(n, R) \u00d7 GL(p, R) < GL(n, C) \u00d7 GL(p, C),\nwe denote by GC the Zariski closure of G in GL(n, C) \u00d7 GL(p, C). By Schwarz\n[13, 2.2-2.6], the set GC is a reductive complex algebraic subgroup of the algebraic group GL(n, C) \u00d7 GL(p, C), and if we write g and gC for the Lie algebras\nof G and GC , respectively, then gC = g + ig.\nWe argue that GC < AfC , which will prove that dimC GC \u2264 1 by Wall's\ntheorem (that is, theorem 46).\nThe action of GC on (Cn , 0) \u00d7 (Cp , 0) is algebraic, and hence Zariski continuous. Viewing G as a subset of GC with the induced Zariski topology, the\nmaps\n\u03a6 : G \u2192 Cp ,\ng 7\u2192 (g * f )C (z)\n\u03a6C : GC \u2192 Cp , gC 7\u2192 (gC * fC )(z)\nare Zariski continuous for any fixed z \u2208 Cn , and \u03a6C is a continuous extension\nof \u03a6.\nThe map \u03a6 is constant, because G < Af and hence g * f = f for all g \u2208 G.\nBut G is Zariski dense in GC by [13], and points are closed in the Zariski topology\non Cp ; hence \u03a6C must be constant as well. Since this holds for all z \u2208 Cn , it\nfollows that GC < AfC , and dim GC \u2264 1 by theorem 46.\nThen dimC gC \u2264 1, and since gC = g + ig, we must have dimR g \u2264 1, and in\nparticular dimR G \u2264 1.\nExample computations\nThe results from section 4.3 allow us to efficiently compute maximal compact\nsubgroups Kf for germs that are of particular interest to us, as illustrated in the\nexample below. The argumentation will obviously carry over to a wide range of\nother cases.\nExample 47 Let f : (R2 , 0) \u2192 (R, 0) belong to the Ep,0 (\u2217) or Zp,0 (\u2217)-series of\nsingularities; namely, let f be one of the map-germs\na) (x, y) 7\u2192 x3 + \u03bbxy 2p + y 3p ,\nb) (x, y) 7\u2192 y(x3 + \u03bbxy 2p + y 3p ),\nwith p > 1 and \u03bb 6= 0. Then f is a weighted homogeneous polynomial, and\nin particular, f is R\u2217 -equivariant, so {\u00b11} is a compact subgroup of Af . We\nshow that {\u00b11} is a maximal compact subgroup of Af by showing that it is a\nmaximal compact subgroup of Kf . Below, we give the argument for the germ\na); the argument for b) is almost identical. See [2, Theorem 97] for a more\ndetailed account.\nLet G < Kf be a maximal compact subgroup. Suppose that (l, (h1 , h2 )) \u2208 G,\nwhich acts on f by\n(l, (h1 , h2 )) * f \u0303(x, y) = l(x, y) * f \u0303(h1 (x, y), h2 (x, y)).\nWe note that for elements of Kf , the diffeomorphism l is completely determined\nby (h1 , h2 ); in other words G is determined by its action on the source space,\n22\n\n\fand the projection\np : K = C o R \u2192 R,\n\n(l, (h1 , h2 )) 7\u2192 (h1 , h2 ),\n\nrestricts to an injection on Kf . Thus, it is enough to show that the set of pairs\nh = (h1 , h2 ), which can be part of an element in Kf , is isomorphic to {\u00b11}.\nSince j 1 G \u223c\n= G, we can show this by investigating the 1-jet of h, denoted\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u03b1 \u03b2\nj1h =\n.\n\u03b3 \u03b4\nSince h comes from an element of Kf , we must have\na) \u03b2 = 0,\nb) \u03b1, \u03b4 \u2208 {\u00b11},\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1 0\n1\nc) j h =\ncan only hold if \u03b3 = 0,\n\u03b3 1\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u22121 0\n1\nd) j h =\nnever holds,\n\u03b3 1\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u22121 0\n1\ne) j h =\ncan only hold if p is odd,\n\u03b3 \u22121\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1 0\nf) j 1 h =\ncan only hold if p is even.\n\u03b3 \u22121\nHere, a) follows from weighted homogeneity of f ; b) and c) follows from the\nfact that j 1 (prR (G)) is a finite matrix group so hk = id for some k \u2208 N0 . To\nsee d)-f), plug in polynomial expansions for h1 and h2 into the formula for f\nand use weighted homogeneity of f to deduce relations on the coefficients of the\nhi , which can only be true under the conditions d)-f). Now we know that G\nconsists of the identity along with elements (l, (h1 , h2 )) such that j 1 h is of the\nform e) if p is odd, or f) if p is even. Again, using the fact that G is finite, we\nsee that in both cases, there is only one valid value of \u03b3. Hence, G \u223c\n= Z2 , and\n{\u00b11} \u223c\n= Z2 is a maximal compact subgroup of Af .\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors wish to thank Hans Brodersen, Maria Aparecida Soares Ruas and\nDavid Trotman, whose careful reading detected a mistake in the original version\nof the argument.\nThis work was supported by the Magnus Ehrnrooth Foundation, as well as\nthe Centre for Stochastic Geometry and Advanced Bioimaging, funded by a\ngrant from the Villum Foundation.
