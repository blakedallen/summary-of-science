Technological advances, like the introduction of micro-vertex detectors, allow for much better\ntagging of the produced heavy quarks and hence more\nprecise measurements. An equally significant improvement\nof the theoretical foundations for heavy flavor production\nhas been achieved, in particular, novel proposals to overcome limitations of fixed-order calculations and to model\nthe hadronization of heavy quarks more reliably [1]. As a\nconsequence, a discrepancy between data and theory for\nbottom production, suggested by various experiments, has\nbeen reduced to the point that it no longer appears significant [2].\nA solid understanding of the theoretical framework\nfor heavy quark production and its phenomenological inputs is of utmost importance for several key measurements\nboth ongoing or taking place in the very near future [1]. At\nthe LHC, heavy flavor production by genuine QCD processes is an important background to searches for Higgs\nbosons within the Standard Model and beyond, e.g., to the\ndecay H \u2192 bb\u0304, as well as for new physics. At the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) one wants to establish\nthe existence and to investigate the properties of a new\nstate of matter, the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Several\nsignatures related to heavy flavors have been proposed, in\nparticular, how their production and decays are modified\nby the presence of a QGP [3]. Here, heavy flavor production in proton-proton collisions will act as a benchmark for\npossible modification in nucleus-nucleus collisions at the\nsame energy [3,4]. In addition, RHIC is also capable to\ncollide longitudinally polarized protons at center-of-mass\n\n\u221a\nsystem (c.m.s.) energies of up to S = 500 GeV. Besides\nits intrinsic interest as an important test of the dynamics\nof spin-dependent hard-scattering in QCD, these measurements are likely to further our understanding of how gluons contribute to the proton spin, a major goal of hadron\nphysics [5].\nIn terms of perturbative QCD (pQCD), relevant fixedorder calculations have been in place for quite some time\nnow, and next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy is the\nstate-of-the-art throughout. NLO results, which keep the\nfull dependence on the heavy quark mass mQ , for unpolarized hadron-hadron (\"hadroproduction\"), photon-hadron\n(\"photoproduction\"), and electron-hadron (\"electroproduction\") collisions can be found in [6], [7], and [8], respectively. Calculations for longitudinally polarized hadro- [9]\nand photoproduction [10] are more recent achievements.\nIn each case one exploits the fact that mQ acts as an effective infrared cut-off for collinear singularities, which allows\nto compute total heavy quark yields as a perturbative series in the strong coupling \u03b1s evaluated at a hard scale\nof O(mQ ). For inclusive transverse-momentum pT distributions, complications arise once pT /mQ \u226b 1, and large\nlogarithms in this ratio have to be resummed to all orders\nin \u03b1s to improve the convergence of the perturbative series\n[11].\nIn this paper, we will focus on a detailed phenomenological study of the prospects of open charm production\nin p\u0304p and pp collisions at the future GSI-FAIR [12] and\nJ-PARC [13] facilities, respectively. For GSI-FAIR we consider the so-called \"collider option\" as proposed by the\nPAX collaboration [14], using a 15 GeV anti-proton and\na 3.5 GeV proton beam, with the plan of having both\nbeams also longitudinally or transversely polarized. The\nmain goal of the PAX experiment would be a determination of the so far unknown \"transversity\" parton densities through the transversely polarized Drell-Yan process.\n\n\f2\n\nJ. Riedl, A. Sch\u00e4fer, M. Stratmann: Prospects of Open Charm Production at GSI-FAIR and J-PARC\n\nThis measurement would gain substantially from a polarized anti-proton beam due to the dominance of the lowest order (LO) quark-antiquark annihilation channel. The\nJ-PARC facility in Japan is currently being completed.\nHere we consider the collision of a 50 GeV proton beam\nwith a fixed, solid-state target. The possibility of having\nboth beam and target polarized is a conceivable option\nfor future upgrades currently being scrutinized. At GSIFAIR\n\u221a (J-PARC) the available p\u0304p (pp) c.m.s. energy will\nbe S \u2243 14.5 (10) GeV. For both experiments the details\nof the detector and the acceptance are not yet finalized.\nWe will make some reasonable assumptions as stated below in Sec. 3.1. We will demonstrate that measurements\nof open charm at these facilities have the potential to further our understanding of the underlying QCD dynamics\nat moderate c.m.s. energies so far little explored.\nFirst, one has to determine, of course, to what extent\nperturbative QCD is applicable at c.m.s. energies of about\n10 to 15 GeV. NLO calculations for single-inclusive pT spectra of pions or photons are known to seriously undershoot data even at somewhat higher c.m.s. energies [15].\nThe mass of the charm quark already sets a hard scale\nof O(1 GeV), which may facilitate the use of perturbative\nQCD even for small or vanishing transverse momenta pT\nof the observed charm quark. Also, since pT \u2248 O(mQ ),\nwe do not have to worry about potentially large logarithms ln pT /mQ present at large c.m.s. energies [11], however, partonic threshold effects may become important\nand perhaps need to be resummed to all orders. In case\nof pT -differential pion spectra, it was shown that threshold resummations can lead to a much improved agreement between theory and experiment at low c.m.s. energies [15]. To study the possible relevance of resummations\nat GSI-FAIR and J-PARC, we provide total and differential charm yields for both p\u0304p and pp collisions at NLO\naccuracy of QCD, including detailed discussions of theoretical uncertainties due to variations of the charm quark\nmass or the renormalization and factorization scales. We\nnote that the computation of threshold resummations for\ncharm production at GSI-FAIR and J-PARC is far beyond\nthe scope of this paper, which aims at a first exploratory\nstudy of charm physics at comparatively low c.m.s. energies.\nOther interesting, though experimentally more challenging observables related to open charm production can\nbe considered at GSI-FAIR and J-PARC. One is the so\ncalled \"charge asymmetry\" which describes the difference\nof cross sections for producing a heavy quark Q or a heavy\nanti-quark Q\u0304 at a certain point in phase-space:\nAC \u2261\n\nd\u03c3 Q \u2212 d\u03c3 Q\u0304\nd\u03c3 Q + d\u03c3 Q\u0304\n\n.\n\n(1)\n\nThis asymmetry probes a subset of NLO radiative corrections and vanishes at the LO approximation. This feature\nmakes it an important test of QCD hard scattering dynamics. The Abelian (QED) part of AC is also known as\nforward-backward asymmetry [16] and is caused by the\ninterference of states with different C-parity. It should be\nmentioned that routinely used event generators based on\n\nLO matrix elements cannot predict this interesting effect.\nIn the unpolarized case the charge asymmetry was first\nmentioned in [17,6] and later studied qualitatively in [18,\n19], mainly for top production at the TeVatron and the\nLHC. A first measurement of AC for top production has\nbeen recently reported by the CDF collaboration [20]. We\nestimate the size of this effect for GSI-FAIR and J-PARC\nand, for the first time, compute the corresponding charge\nasymmetry also for polarized hadroproduction. We will\ngive more details in Sec. 2.2.\nProvided that longitudinally polarized beams and targets will be available at GSI-FAIR and/or J-PARC, studies of the double-spin asymmetry\nALL \u2261\n\nd\u2206\u03c3\n.\nd\u03c3\n\n(2)\n\ncould provide unique insight in the distributions describing the polarization of quarks and gluons in the nucleon\nat medium-to-large momentum fractions x. In (2), d\u2206\u03c3\ndenotes the spin-dependent cross section, which can be\nobtained by taking the difference of measurements with\nthe (anti-)proton spins aligned and anti-aligned. The unpolarized cross section d\u03c3 is determined by the sum of\nboth measurements. We will explore the sensitivity of ALL\nto different assumptions about polarized parton densities,\nin particular, the elusive gluon polarization. As for the\nunpolarized cross sections, we discuss theoretical uncertainties related to variations of the charm quark mass and\nthe renormalization and factorization scales.\nThe paper is organized as follows: in Sec. 2 we briefly\nreview the technical framework for hadroproduction of\nheavy flavors, set our notation, and introduce in some\ndetail the charge asymmetry. Section 3 is devoted to numerical studies. First we define the phenomenological inputs and experimental cuts we assume for GSI-FAIR and\nJ-PARC. Next, we give results for total and differential\nunpolarized charm cross sections and discuss their theoretical uncertainties. These results serve as a future benchmark to study\n\u221a the applicability of pQCD for charm production at S \u2243 10 GeV. Then we present expectations\nfor the polarized cross sections and charge and double spin\nasymmetries. We briefly summarize the main results in\nSec. 4.\n\n2 Technical Framework\nThe pQCD framework for single-inclusive heavy flavor\nproduction at NLO accuracy in both unpolarized and longitudinally polarized hadron-hadron collisions has been\ndiscussed in detail in Refs. [6] and [9], respectively. We\ncan restrict ourselves to a brief summary of the aspects\nwith particular relevance to our analysis.\n2.1 The single-inclusive cross section\nWe are interested in the hadroproduction of a heavy quark\nQ [anti-quark Q\u0304] with mass mQ and four-momentum PQ\n\n\fJ. Riedl, A. Sch\u00e4fer, M. Stratmann: Prospects of Open Charm Production at GSI-FAIR and J-PARC\n\n[PQ\u0304 ]:\nH1 (P1 )H2 (P2 ) \u2192 Q(PQ )[Q\u0304(PQ\u0304 )] + X.\n\n(3)\n\nX includes all other final-state particles such that (3) is\ninclusive with respect to the detected heavy quark. P1,2\ndenote the momenta of the colliding hadrons H1,2 and\nS = (P1 + P2 )2 the c.m.s. energy squared.\nMore specifically, PQ can be parameterized in terms\nof the transverse momentum pT , the rapidity y, and the\nazimuthal angle \u03c6 of the observed heavy quark Q,\nPQ = (mT cosh y, pT sin \u03c6, pT cos \u03c6, mT sinh y),\n(4)\nq\nwhere the transverse mass is defined as mT = p2T + m2Q\n\nwhere X = Q\u0304. The O(\u03b1s ) radiative corrections to (6) comprise additional real gluon emission, X = Q\u0304g, as well as\none-loop (virtual) contributions. In addition, a new type\nof subprocess, gluon-[anti]quark-scattering, gq[q\u0304] \u2192 QX\nhas to be considered at NLO. A detailed account of the\ncalculation of the relevant matrix elements, the required\nloop and phase-space integrations, and the cancellation of\nsingularities is given in Refs. [6] and [9].\nSince mQ acts as an effective cut-off for collinear singularities, also total heavy quark yields are amenable to\npQCD. They are obtained by integrating (5) over the entire phase-space using\nZ\n\nand y = 21 ln[(E + Pz )/(E \u2212 Pz )]. Applying the factorization theorem, the unpolarized differential cross section for\n(3) can be written schematically as\n\nZ\n\n2 Q\n\nX\nd \u03c3\n=\nfaH1 (x1 , \u03bcf ) \u2297 fbH2 (x2 , \u03bcf )\n2\ndmT dy\nab\n\n\u2297\n\nd2 \u03c3\u0302ab\u2192QX (x1 , x2 , P1 , P2 , PQ , \u03bcf , \u03bcr )\n(5)\ndm2T dy\n\nwith the symbol \u2297 indicating a convolution. x1 and x2 are\nthe fractions of P1 and P2 taken by the partons faH1 and\nfbH2 with flavor a and b, respectively. The sum in Eq. (5)\nis to be performed over all contributing partonic channels\nab \u2192 QX with d\u03c3\u0302ab\u2192QX the associated partonic cross\nsections.\nThe factorization of the cross section (5) into nonperturbative parton densities fa,b and short-distance cross\nsections requires the introduction of factorization and renormalization scales \u03bcf and \u03bcr , respectively. These scales\nare essentially arbitrary and usually chosen to be of the\norder of a hard momentum transfer characterizing the process under consideration. Any residual dependence of the\nright-hand-side (r.h.s.) of Eq. (5) on the actual choice for\n\u03bcf,r represents an important part of the uncertainties in\nthe theoretical description of (3).\nThe basic framework outlined above carries over to\nthe case of polarized hadron-hadron collisions as well. To\nobtain the spin-dependent cross section d2 \u2206\u03c3/dm2T dy entering the experimentally relevant spin asymmetry ALL\ndefined in Eq. (2), the parton densities and hard scattering\ncross sections on the r.h.s. of Eq. (5) have to be replaced\nby their polarized counterparts \u2206fa,b and d\u2206\u03c3\u0302ab\u2192QX , respectively.\nKnowledge of higher-order corrections in the perturbative expansion of the partonic cross sections d\u03c3\u0302ab\u2192QX and\nd\u2206\u03c3\u0302ab\u2192QX is generally indispensable. On the one hand,\nin hadronic scattering they are often sizable, and, on the\nother hand, they are expected to reduce the artificial dependence on the choice of \u03bcf,r . Also, higher-order corrections affect unpolarized and polarized cross sections differently and hence do not cancel in the ratio ALL .\nAt O(\u03b12s ), the LO approximation, the hadroproduction of heavy quarks proceeds through only two partonic\nchannels\ngg \u2192 QX and q q\u0304 \u2192 QX\n(6)\n\n3\n\nwhere \u03b2 \u2261\n\nS/4\nm2Q\n1\n2\n\ndm2T\n\nln\n\nZ\n\n1+\u03b2\n1\u2212\u03b2\n1+\u03b2\n1\u2212\u03b2\n\n\u221a\n\nS/(2mT )\n\n\u221a\n\u2212 cosh\u22121 S/(2mT )\n\ndy\n\u2212 21 ln\n\ncosh\u22121\n\nZ\n\ndy =\n\nS/(4 cosh2 y)\n\nm2Q\n\ndm2T ,\n\n(7)\n\nq\n1 \u2212 4m2Q /S. Alternatively, one can first de-\n\nrive the so-called \"scaling functions\", [\u2206]\u03c3\u0302ab (s, m2Q ), as a\nfunction of the partonic c.m.s. energy s by integrating the\npartonic cross sections d[\u2206]\u03c3\u0302ab\u2192QX [6,9], which then in\nturn have to be combined with the appropriate combination of parton densities. We note that the experimental\ndetermination of the total cross section always involves\nsome extrapolation beyond the accessible ranges in pT and\ny and is therefore less reliable and useful than differential\nrates in testing pQCD predictions. In our numerical studies for J-PARC and GSI-FAIR we will therefore mainly\nfocus on differential cross sections, which are also relevant\nfor the charge asymmetry.\n\n2.2 The charge asymmetry\nAt the LO approximation the processes (6) relevant for\nheavy flavor production do not discriminate between a\nproduced heavy quark Q and a heavy anti-quark Q\u0304. Hence,\nat any given point (pT , y) in phase-space the yields (5) for\nQ and Q\u0304 are identical.\nRadiative corrections change this picture and give rise\nto the charge asymmetry AC , defined in Eq. (1). Any measurement of AC will directly probe and perhaps improve\nour understanding of QCD dynamics beyond the LO. So\nfar this higher-order effect has received relatively little attention [17,18,19] but was recently measured for the first\ntime in case of top production at CDF [20], the asymmetry exceeding the few percent predicted in [18] with\nlarge experimental uncertainties though. We will explore\nthe prospects of accessing AC in pp and p\u0304p collisions at JPARC and GSI-FAIR, respectively. Due to the relatively\nlow c.m.s. energies available, we have to limit ourselves\nto charm quark production. Given that longitudinally polarized beams and targets are a viable option, we also\nexplore the polarized charge asymmetry, which we define\nas in Eq. (1) with the cross sections d\u03c3 Q[Q\u0304] replaced by\ntheir polarized counterparts d\u2206\u03c3 Q[Q\u0304] .\n\n\f4\n\nJ. Riedl, A. Sch\u00e4fer, M. Stratmann: Prospects of Open Charm Production at GSI-FAIR and J-PARC\n\nfor all i, j. By interchanging Q and Q\u0304, the Dirac structure relevant for Mi M\u2217j changes sign for an odd number\nof propagators in the heavy quark trace and otherwise\nremains the same. The color structure is invariant, except for Tr[Tk Tl Tm ] = (dklm + ifklm )/4 which contains a\nsymmetric and an anti-symmetric piece, dklm = dmlk and\nfklm = \u2212fmlk , respectively.\nCombining everything, only those cut diagrams with\nthree vertices on both the heavy and the light quark line,\ncf. Figs. 1 and 2, contribute to AC , and one finds [18]\n\nFig. 1. Sample q q\u0304 cut diagram contributing to AC .\n\n\u2206ij =\n\nFig. 2. Sample gq cut diagram contributing to AC .\n\nAt NLO the charge asymmetry receives only a very\nlimited number of contributions. Instead of making use of\nthe results available in the literature [6,9], we chose to recalculate the numerator of AC from scratch in both the unpolarized and polarized case1 . The origin of AC resides in\nthe Abelian (QED) part of the higher order processes and\nrelates to the interference between amplitudes which are\nrelatively odd under the exchange of Q and Q\u0304. The gluongluon fusion process in (6) is evidently charge symmetric\nalso beyond the LO and does not contribute to AC . Also\nnon-Abelian amplitudes involving the triple-gluon vertex\ndepend only on Q + Q\u0304 and lead to contributions which are\nsymmetric under exchanging Q and Q\u0304. Upon close examination of the remaining amplitudes for the q q\u0304 and gq [g q\u0304]\ninitiated subprocesses at NLO, one finds that only such\n\"cut diagrams\" contribute which have three vertices on\nboth the heavy and light quark line. In case of the virtual\nloop corrections to the LO q q\u0304 process, only the interference\nof the box diagrams with the Born amplitude contributes.\nExamples of cut diagrams relevant for the computation of\nAC and \u2206AC are depicted in Figs. 1 and 2.\nThis observation can be readily understood. To this\nend, let us write the partonic subprocess cross section\nd\u03c3\u0302ab\u2192QX as the sum of the interference contributions of\nall contributing amplitudes labeled by the indices i, j\nd\u03c3\u0302ab\u2192QX = Kab\n\nX\nij\n\nMi M\u2217j\n\nab\u2192QX\n\n.\n\n(8)\n\nFor simplicity, pre-factors such as the spin and color averages are mapped into Kab . Phase-space integration for\nall unobserved partons is implicitly understood in (8). Expressions similar to (8) hold for polarized partonic cross\nsections d\u2206\u03c3\u0302ab\u2192QX as well as for ab \u2192 Q\u0304X. For the numerator of AC we have to examine the difference\n\u2206ij =\n1\n\nMi M\u2217j\n\nab\u2192QX\n\n\u2212\n\nMi M\u2217j\n\nab\u2192Q\u0304X\n\n(9)\n\nThe lengthy expressions are available upon request from\nthe authors.\n\n1\n\u2217\n^\n(dklm )2 M\ni Mj\n8\n\nab\u2192QX\n\n,\n\n(10)\n\n\u2217\n^\nwith (dklm )2 = 40/3. M\ni Mj denotes the interference of\nthe two amplitudes with the QCD color structure taken\naside, and is the same (up to pre-factors) as for corresponding QED processes [16], e.g, e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 \u03b3. Let\nus mention that there is a similar effect in the QCD scale\nevolution of parton densities at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) also proportional to (dklm )2 and leading to a\nstrange quark asymmetry s(x) 6= s\u0304(x) [21].\nAll contributions to the numerator of AC at O(\u03b13s ) are\nfree of ultraviolet as well as collinear singularities as a consequence of the symmetry of the LO processes (6) under\nexchanging Q and Q\u0304. Infrared (IR) singularities appear\nin both real gluon emission and virtual loop corrections\nto the LO q q\u0304 process and cancel in the sum. Effectively\nthis implies that the NLO matrix elements only contain\nthe charge asymmetry at LO approximation. As in [6,9]\nwe use dimensional regularization to deal with IR poles in\nintermediate steps of the calculation. In [18] a small gluon\ng\nenergy Ecut\nwas used to cut off IR singularities. While\nthe charge asymmetry also appears in the limit mQ \u2192 0,\nit vanishes for the total heavy quark cross section as a\nconsequence of charge conjugation invariance.\nIn Sec. 3.3 we give some quantitative predictions for\nAC and \u2206AC at J-PARC and GSI-FAIR. Due to the low\nc.m.s. energies, gluons are much less abundant than at\nhigh-energy colliders. Since gluon-gluon fusion only contributes to the denominator of AC , the prospects for studying AC can be in fact more favorable at GSI-FAIR or JPARC than at colliders like the TeVatron or the LHC.\nHere, gluon-gluon fusion is by far the dominant mechanism for heavy quark production, and one has to find\nsuitable corners of phase-space to make AC experimentally accessible. One important possibility is top quark\nproduction [18,19,20], which receives important contributions from q q\u0304 annihilation also at large S thanks to the\nsizable mQ .\n\n3 Phenomenological Applications\nBefore turning to the prospects of heavy flavor physics at\nGSI-FAIR and J-PARC, we quickly review the information on charm\n\u221a production in pp collisions at c.m.s. energies below S = 50 GeV gathered so far. Figure 3 shows\nthe available data [22] compared to our calculations at\nNLO accuracy using different values of the charm quark\n\n\fJ. Riedl, A. Sch\u00e4fer, M.

Experimental results [22] for the total charm production cross section at fixed-target energies compared to NLO\npQCD calculations for three different values of the charm quark\nmass mc . In each case, the shaded band indicates the theoretical uncertainties from varying \u03bc = \u03bcr = \u03bcf in the range\nmc \u2264 \u03bc \u2264 2mc .\n\nmass and scales \u03bc = \u03bcf = \u03bcr in Eq. (5). As can be seen,\nuncertainties from small variations of mc are as important as scale ambiguities, and both combined can lead to\nalmost an\n\u221a order of magnitude change in the total charm\nyield at S \u2243 10 \u00f7 20 GeV. From Fig. 3 one can also infer\nthat the theoretical uncertainties become somewhat less\npronounced with increasing c.m.s. energy.\nAlthough most experimental results can be described\nwith the same choice of mc and scale \u03bc, there is a clear\nneed for further precise measurements, in particular closer\nto threshold, below the result of NA32, which does not\nline up so well with other experiments. GSI-FAIR and JPARC, to which we shall turn now, can explore this energy\nrange in the future.\n\n5\n\nboth beam and target being unpolarized. We also consider\nlongitudinally polarized collisions, which are a conceivable\nupgrade of the J-PARC facility in the future [13]. Since\nnot very much is known about the experimental set-up at\nthis stage, we assume a forward spectrometer geometry\nwith a 200 mrad acceptance, similar to the one used by\nthe COMPASS experiment at CERN.\nSince the details of charm detection in experiment are\nnot yet available, we will perform all our calculations on\nthe charm quark level, i.e., we do not attempt to model\nthe hadronization of charm quarks into charmed mesons\nand their subsequent decays. For the PAX experiment,\nhowever, identification of open charm events most likely\nproceeds through the detection of decay muons for which\na lower limit on their momentum of p\u03bc = 1 GeV is required [14,23]. Therefore we impose a similar cut on the\nlaboratory momentum of the primary charm quark in all\nour calculations for GSI-FAIR.\nIn all unpolarized calculations at LO and NLO accuracy we use the CTEQ6L1 and CTEQ6M parton distribution functions [24] and the corresponding LO and NLO\nvalues for the strong coupling, respectively. Unless stated\notherwise, the GRSV \"standard\" set of helicity-dependent\nparton densities [25] is used in the computation of polarized cross sections and the charge and spin asymmetries.\nSince mc = 1.35 GeV provides a good description of most\nof the data shown in Fig. 3, we make this our default\nchoice for the charm quark mass.\n3.2 Expectations for charm production cross sections\n\nFigure 4 shows our expectations for the unpolarized charm\nproduction cross section (5) at GSI-FAIR at LO and NLO\naccuracy, integrated over transverse momentum pT > pmin\nT\nand the angular acceptance of 5\u25e6 \u2264 \u03b8c \u2264 130\u25e6 for PAX.\nThe shaded bands indicate the theoretical uncertainties\nwhen the factorization and renormalization scales are varied simultaneously in the range mmin\n\u2264 \u03bcf = \u03bcr \u2264 2mmin\nT\nT .\nAlso shown in Fig. 4 are the \"K-factors\", the ratio of\nthe NLO and LO cross sections, for two choices of scales\n\u03bcf = \u03bcr and the fractional contributions of the different\nc\npartonic channels \u03c3ij\nto the NLO cross section.\nBesides the sizable dependence on the scales \u03bcf,r , there\n3.1 Phenomenological inputs and experimental cuts\nis also a similar uncertainty due to the choice of mc in the\nregion pmin\n. 1 GeV, in line with the observations for the\nT\nThe part of the future GSI-FAIR accelerator complex ame- total charm yields in Fig. 3.

The genuine\nNLO quark-gluon subprocess is negligible in the entire pT\nrange shown.\nThe corresponding results for J-PARC are summarized\nin Fig. 5. There are striking differences compared to the\nresult for GSI-FAIR shown in the previous figure. The dependence of the charm cross section on unphysical scales\n\u03bcf,r is even larger here and does not improve when NLO\ncorrections are included. This can be taken as a strong indication that higher order terms in the perturbative series\nare very important. Hopefully, a resummation of the leading terms to all orders in \u03b1s will tame the scale ambiguities. Secondly, the size of the NLO corrections compared to\nthe LO term, displayed in the middle panel of Fig. 5, seems\nto be beyond control. Most of the pathological behavior\nof the K-factor at large pmin\ncan be attributed to the difT\nferences in the LO and NLO gluon distributions at large\nx1,2 , where they are basically unconstrained by data [24].\nIf one uses NLO parton densities in the calculation of the\nLO cross section, the K-factor does not show such a sharp\nrise, though it remains large (dotted curve in Fig. 5).

They also show, however, that the pQCD\nframework can not be taken for granted in this energy\nregime, and its applicability has to be carefully scrutinized first by comparing the theoretical expectations with\ndata.\nFigure 6 shows the corresponding longitudinally polarized cross sections at NLO accuracy for GSI-FAIR and JPARC, respectively.

(1) and Sec. 2.2. We show expectations for the size of the effect and discuss the theoretical\nuncertainties due to variations of \u03bcf,r and mc . All results\nare presented as a function of the c.m.s. rapidity y of the\nheavy (anti-)quark, which is related to the rapidity in the\nlaboratory frame ylab by a simple additive boost. Positive\nrapidities refer to the direction of the anti-proton and proton beam at GSI-FAIR and J-PARC, respectively. Recall\nthat rapidity y and pseudo-rapidity \u03b7 are not the same for\nmassive particles.

The scale \u03bcf,r\ndependence partially cancels out in AC , as can be seen by\ncomparing the upper and lower panels of Figs. 7 and 8. A\nresidual dependence on \u03bcf,r is not surprising since the numerator of AC at O(\u03b13s ) is effectively a LO approximation.\nIt vanishes at O(\u03b12s ) and is free of collinear singularities.\nAlso note that the sharp drop of d\u03c3 c /dy + d\u03c3 c\u0304 /dy in the\nlower panel of Fig. 7 is due to the cut imposed on the\nmomentum of the heavy (anti-)quark, plab > 1 GeV.\nFigure 9 shows our results for the longitudinally polarized charge asymmetry \u2206AC defined as in Eq.

The integrated double-spin asymmetry ALL as function of pmin\nat NLO accuracy for GSI-FAIR (left panel) and JT\nPARC (right panel) using the GRSV \"standard\" distributions and the same experimental cuts as before. The scale uncertainty\nis shown for three different choices of mc , varying \u03bc = \u03bcr = \u03bcf in the range mmin\n\u2264 \u03bc \u2264 2mmin\nT\nT .\n\ntained with different sets of polarized parton densities.\nApart from our default set, GRSV \"standard\", we also use\nthe sets of AAC [27] and DNS [28]. The latter is based on\nan analysis using also data from polarized semi-inclusive\ndeep-inelastic scattering. Two different choices of partonto-hadron fragmentation functions have been made in the\nDNS analysis, and the two resulting sets, labeled as DNS\n(KRE) and DNS (KKP) in Fig. 10, differ mainly in the\nsea quark content, in particular, \u2206\u016b, which has opposite sign in both sets. The positive polarization of \u2206\u016b in\nDNS (KKP), unlike in all others sets of spin-dependent\nparton densities, is responsible for the opposite sign of\nd\u2206\u03c3 c /dy\u00b1d\u2206\u03c3 c\u0304 /dy obtained with DNS (KKP). In the denominator of \u2206AC , gluon-gluon fusion does not drop out\nand can make a significant contribution depending on the\namount of gluon polarization \u2206g. The set with the largest\n\u2206g, AAC, gives the largest cross section. The other three\nsets have relatively small gluon distributions and quarkantiquark annihilation is equally important. On the other\nhand, different sets of polarized parton densities have only\nvery limited impact on the results for d\u2206\u03c3 c /dy \u00b1d\u2206\u03c3 c\u0304 /dy\nand \u2206AC for GSI-FAIR.\nThis can be expected, since in p\u0304p\n\u221a\ncollisions at small S one predominantly probes the fairly\nwell constrained valence quark distributions, and uncertainties in the polarized sea-quark and gluon densities do\nnot matter much.\nFinally, we note that without taking into account any\nexperimental cuts, AC and \u2206AC are anti-symmetric functions in the c.m.s. rapidity for p\u0304p collisions, as can be anticipated from Figs. 7 - 9 (which, however, do include certain\n\nacceptance cuts). Similarly, AC and \u2206AC are symmetric\nin c.m.s. rapidity for pp experiments. This is a consequence\nof the anti-symmetric and symmetric initial states p\u0304p and\npp, respectively. The charge asymmetry on the partonic\nlevel for the dominant q q\u0304 subprocess implies that Q is\npreferentially emitted into the direction of q and Q\u0304 into\nthe direction of q\u0304. As was explained in [18], in pp collisions\none then finds an excess of centrally produced Q\u0304, while Q\ndominates at large absolute rapidities. This is also what we\nobserve for J-PARC in Figs. 8 and 9. The size of AC and\n\u2206AC for pp collisions at J-PARC is significantly smaller\nthan for p\u0304p collisions at GSI-FAIR, simply because of the\nfact that for the relevant q q\u0304 subprocess both partons are\nvalence quarks in p\u0304p, greatly enhancing its relative contribution. When integrated over rapidity and without any\nkinematical restrictions, AC and \u2206AC vanish, and the total yields of charm and anti-charm quarks are the same.\n3.4 Expectation for longitudinal spin asymmetries\nExperiments usually present their spin-dependent measurements in terms of spin-asymmetries rather than polarized cross sections. The double-spin asymmetry ALL ,\ndefined in Eq. (2), has the advantage that many experimental uncertainties cancel in the ratio, in particular, it\nis not required to determine the absolute normalization\nof the helicity dependent cross sections. Also, theoretical\nuncertainties may cancel to some extent in ALL . However,\nbefore exploiting this, one has to make sure that pQCD is\n\n\f10\n\nJ. Riedl, A. Sch\u00e4fer, M.

As can be seen, there is still a significant scale ambiguity and, in case of J-PARC, also a dependence on mc . We refrain from showing LO results, but\nwe note that because NLO corrections tend to be larger in\nthe unpolarized case, as discussed above, ALL is typically\nreduced by a factor of about two when NLO corrections\nare included.\n\n0\n-0.05\n-0.1\n\nALL\n\n-0.15\n\nGSI-FAIR\n0.1\n\nJ-PARC\n0.05\nmc = 1.45 GeV\nmc = 1.35 GeV\nmc = 1.25 GeV\n\n0\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\ny\n\n2\n\nFig. 13.

As expected, the\ndifferences are small for GSI-FAIR which mainly probes\nthe fairly well known valence distributions. Only at large\npmin\nT , which corresponds to currently unexplored momentum fractions x1,2 \u2192 1, some differences are noticeable. At\nJ-PARC, expectations for ALL depend much more on the\nchoice of spin-dependent parton densities, in line with the\nobservations already made in the lower panel of Fig. 10.\nFinally, in Fig. 13 we present the spin asymmetry as\na function of the c.m.s. rapidity y and integrated over\ntransverse momentum. The behavior of ALL for GSI-FAIR\nin the upper panel for positive y is driven by the cut on\nthe charm momentum plab > 1 GeV. Both mass and scale\nuncertainties do not cancel and remain significant.\n\n\fJ. Riedl, A. Sch\u00e4fer, M. Stratmann: Prospects of Open Charm Production at GSI-FAIR and J-PARC\n\n4 Conclusions\nWe have performed a detailed study of the physics opportunities with open charm production at low c.m.s. energy p\u0304p and pp collisions at GSI-FAIR and J-PARC, respectively, including unpolarized and polarized cross sections and charge and spin asymmetries. All calculations\nare done at O(\u03b13s ) accuracy, and theoretical uncertainties\ndue to the choice of scales \u03bcf,r and the charm mass mc\nare discussed in detail. In general, they turn out to be significant with the exception of the mass dependence of the\ncharge asymmetries AC and \u2206AC .\nMeasurements of all these quantities would further our\nunderstanding of the perturbative QCD framework and\nthe nucleon structure expressed in terms of unpolarized\nand polarized parton densities. The latter are probed at\nlarge momentum fractions x1,2 , which are difficult to access at high-energy colliders. The charge asymmetry vanishes at O(\u03b12s ) and hence is a clear probe of non-trivial\nQCD dynamics beyond the LO. Detailed comparisons between our theoretical expectations for unpolarized charm\nyields and future data will reveal to what extent perturbative\n\u221a methods are applicable in hadron-hadron collisions at\nS \u2248 10 \u00f7 15 GeV and will open up a window to perturbative resummations and/or the transition into the nonperturbative regime so far only little explored.\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe are grateful to Marco Contalbrigo providing information about the GSI-FAIR PAX project.
