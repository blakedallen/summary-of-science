Fluctuations and spatial correlations play an important role and are often not solvable exactly. Usually these processes are studied\non a lattice that can be regular [1,2], hierarchical or small-world [3]. But in\nmost cases the population in question is mobile. Therefore, in this work we\nstudy a system of particles moving according to a simple Newtonian dynamics. We simulate on it a known contact process [4], described in terms of a\n'SIS' model of infection, or infection without immunization, that is the state\nof the particles are healthy or infected, and are susceptible to re-infection after\nhealing, thus the name of the model (SIS: susceptible-infected-susceptible).\nWe characterize the transition to spreading of the epidemic dynamics, and\n\u22c6 In honor to Per Bak.\n\u2217 Tel.: +49-711-685-3594; fax: +49-711-6853658.\nEmail address: marta@ica1.uni-stuttgart.de (M.C.

The observed behavior results to be the 'SIS' analogous of a model\nof 'stirred percolation' [6,5,7] which was used to describe epidemic dynamics\nwith immunization ('SIR').\n\n2\n\nModel\n\nThe simulations are carried out on q\na square shaped cell of linear size L with\nperiodic boundary conditions. L = \u03c1/N, is given by the number of particles\n(N) and the density (\u03c1). The particles are represented by 'soft-disks' of radius\nr0 moving continuously on the plane. The interaction between two particles\nat positions ri and r j corresponds to a Lennard-Jones potential truncated at\nits minimum,\n\uf8ee\n\nu(ri , rj ) = U0 \uf8f0\n\n2r0\n|r i \u2212 r j |\n\n!12\n\n\u22122\n\n2r0\n|ri \u2212 r j |\n\n!6 \uf8f9\n\n\uf8fb + U0 ,\n\n|r i \u2212 r j | \u2264 2r0 , (1)\n\nreduced units are used in which U0 , r0 , kB (the Boltzmann constant) and m\n(the particle mass) are all unity.\nAlong this paper, the particles are considered to be 'agents', to model the\n'SIS' process described above. In a simple version one can assume that each\ntime two agents (i, j) interact or 'collide' (that is, if |ri \u2212 r j | \u2264 2r0 ), the\ninfection propagates from an infected agent to a susceptible one. In most of\nour simulations we used a simple initial condition: (i) at time t = 0, N agents\nare distributed regularly in the cell, (ii) have the same absolute velocity v with\nrandomly distributed directions, (iii) a central agent is infected and the rest\nare susceptible. At each time step the positions {ri }, velocities {vi } and the\ninfection state {\u03c3i } of the system are updated. We use the molecular dynamics\n(MD) scheme of cell subdivision with the leapfrog integration method [8].\nOnce an agent is infected, it heals and becomes susceptible again after a fixed\nnumber of time steps, that is the 'time of the infection' (\u2206tinf ), and is a free\nparameter of the model.\n\n3\n\nScaling\n\nThe dynamics of an epidemics is described in terms of the infection rate (\u03bb).\nThat is defined as the number of agents one agent infects before healing.\nTherefore, in this model\n\u03bb \u2261 \u2206tinf /\u03c4coll ,\n\n(2)\n2\n\n\f0.8\n\nF(IM)\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\u03c1=0.1 T=1 \u2206tc=14 \u03bb=5.45\n\u03c1=0.1 T=0.5 \u2206tc=14 \u03bb=3.84\n\u03c1=0.05 T=1 \u2206tc=14 \u03bb=2.7\n\u03c1=0.05 T=0.5 \u2206tc=14 \u03bb=1.92\n\u03c1=0.05 T=3 \u2206tc=5.36 \u03bb=1.8\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\ntime\n\nFig. 1. Starting with one infected agent, the figures shows how the infection spreads\nwith time and after a certain period of time ('transient'), the fraction of infected\nagents (FIM ) fluctuates around a mean value. The fraction of infected agents in this\n'quasi-equilibrium' state, increases with the infection rate (\u03bb).\n\nwhere \u03c4coll is the mean time between two collisions, and depends on the mean\nvelocity of agents (hvi). Neglecting the interaction potential with respect to\nthe kinetic energy, one has:\nhvi =\n\ns\n\nkB T \u03c0\n.\nm\n\n(3)\n\nThus, the mean number of collisions (hncoll i) of one agent during a period of\ntime t, is given by the area within which it interacts (2r0 hvit), multiplied by\nthe density,\nhncoll i = \u03c1 2r0 hvit.\n\n(4)\n\nThe pre-factor of time in eq.

In systems of 1254\nagents FIM after the transient is averaged, over 500 initial conditions at a\ngiven \u03bb. In Fig. 3 we see that the results agree with the mean field approximation for densities lower than 0.1. Increasing the density, changes the shape\nof the transition curve. Near the critical point the FIM follows a power law,\nFIM \u223c (\u03bb\u2212\u03bbc )\u03b2 . The inset of Fig. 3 in a double-logarithmic plot, demonstrates\nthis power law behavior, with straight lines of slope \u03b2. As can be seen, the\nvalue of \u03b2 depends on the density of the system. Smaller values of \u03b2 indicate\nmore significant changes of FIM (\u03bb) near the transition. Even for low densities\n(i.e. \u03c1 \u2208 [0.1, 0.2]), where one expects MF to be valid, the critical exponents\nchange with the density.\nIn order to confirm this observation, we study the transition in detail. Fig. 4\nshows the log \u2212 log of FIM vs. (\u03bb \u2212 \u03bbc ), averaging over 1000 realizations in\nsystems with \u03c1 = 0.2, T = 1, and \u03bbc = 0.935.

Numerical estimates for the critical exponent \u03b2, for systems with different\ndensity.\n\nThe relations in eq. (8) apply at long times, and require that the infection\ndoes not reach the boundaries of the system. Results for the three quantities\nP (t), n(t) and R2 (t), averaged over \u223c 103 realizations, with systems of \u223c 104\nagents, and fixed temperature (T = 1), are shown in Fig. 5 for \u03c1 = 0.2.\nThe values of the critical exponents are reported in table 1. The known hyperscaling relation of the dynamics 4\u03b4 + 2\u03b7 = dz, where d is the dimension of\nthe system, is recovered within the range of numerical errors. Increasing the\ndensity of the system gives a continuous change in the critical exponents of\nthe epidemic dynamics, they go from MF values to the exponents for contact\nprocess in a two dimensional lattice [2]. Numerical estimates of the critical\nexponent \u03b2 vs. \u03c1 are shown in Fig. 6.\n\nThe dependence of the critical exponents of the dynamics on the density of\n7\n\n\fagents (\u03c1), is analogous to the dependence on the 'flammable' fraction of space\n(\u03c6), observed in 'forest fire' dynamics, or epidemics dynamics with immunization [5,7], described through 'stirred percolation' models. 'Stirred percolation'\nconsists in random walkers on a changing lattice and was proposed by de\nGennes [6] to describe the behavior of conductivity in binary mixtures [10].\n\n5\n\nPower-law distribution of infection times\n\nConsidering the same value of infection times (\u2206tinf ) for each agent corresponds to situations with homogeneous connectivity. In order to extent the\nmodel to some real world situations where the number of contacts varies\ngreatly from one agent to another, we assign \u2206tinf to each agent following\na power-law distribution,\nP (\u2206tinf ) = (\u03b3 \u2212 1)\u2206t\u2212\u03b3\ninf\n\n\u2206tinf \u2265 1.\n\n(9)\n\nAs a result, for 2 < \u03b3 \u2264 3, the epidemic threshold tends to zero, like has been\nobserved for SF networks [3] (see Fig. 7).\nHowever, the shape of the spreading curve has a point of inflection (\u03c1c ) above\nwhich, the infection is much larger (FIM \u223c (\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1c )\u03b2 , \u03c1c = 0.06(5), \u03b2 = 2.65,\nfor \u03b3 = 2.4).\nWe see that the more 'connected' agents are responsible for the absence of an\nepidemic threshold (tail of the curve). The infection would spreads only if the\nmean rate of spreading is larger than one, that is\ns\n\nh\u2206tinf i\n\u03b3\u22121\n\u03c0T kB\n=\n\u03c1 2r0\n> 1.\n\u03bbc \u2261\n\u03c4coll\n\u03b3\u22122\nm\n\n(10)\n\n\u03bbc = 1 gives the inflection point \u03c1c , which for \u03b3 = 2.4 is \u03c1c = 0.0718 (according\nto eq. 10, for r0 = 21/6 and T = 1), and agrees with the numerical value\n\u03c1c = 0.06(5) reported in Fig. 7 averaging over about 103 realizations with\nabout 103 agents each.\n\n6\n\nConclusions\n\nNovel effects are observed studying the SIS model of infection on a system\nof moving agents. A continuous range of critical exponents are observed as\nfunction of the density of agents, recovering mean field predictions for lower\ndensities, two-dimensional exponents of contact process, increasing the density.\n8\n\n\f1\nFIM ~ (\u03c1\u2212\u03c1c)\n\n0\n\n\u03b2\n\n10\n\n0.8\n\u22121\n\n10\n\n\u22122\n\n0.6\n\n\u03c1\u2212\u03c1c\n\n\u22122\n\n10\n\nFIM(\u03c1)\n\n10\n\n\u22121\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n\u22121\n\n10\n\nFIM(\u03c1)\n\n0.4\n\n\u22123\n\n10\n\n0.2\n\n\u03c1\n\n\u22124\n\nc\n\n0\n\n\u22122\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n0.1\n\n\u22123\n\n\u22122\n\n10\n\n0.2\n\n10\n\n0.3\n\n\u22121\n\u03c1 10\n\n0.4\n\n0\n\n10\n\n0.5\n\n\u03c1\nFig. 7.
