Background\nThe pioneering work of Lotka and Volterra [23], [29], [30] brought to center stage the\nimportance of developing theoretical frameworks that increase our understanding of the role that\npredator-prey or competitive or mutualistic interactions have in shaping community structure. This\nline of theoretical/mathematical research, begun nearly a century ago, continues to challenge and\ninterest ecologists as well conservation and evolutionary biologists. Models incorporating movement\nwithin and between sub-populations have been widely investigated in an effort to understand the role\nof individuals' movement on community sustainability [11], [12], [13], [18], [9], [10], [7].\nThe study of predator-prey dynamics, broadly understood to include, for example, host-parasite\ninteractions, is of importance in population biology. Theoretical studies that focus on the role of preyrefuges on predator-prey systems have been conducted ([18], [24] and references therein). Post, et al.\n[26] have focused on the dynamics of two non-interacting prey populations in an environment where\nthe predator switches in response to prey frequency, a response that has a rather strong stabilizing\neffect on the system. In fact, predators' switching behavior can \"control\" the system's dynamics, to the\npoint that the predator is able to eliminate the possibility of complex dynamics. Lopez-Gomez et al.\n[24] have focused on the role of critical patch size on prey survival in systems that do not include\npredators explicitly. Kuang and Takeuchi [18] have examined the dynamics of predator-prey systems\nwhen the prey disperses in response to local (density-dependent) competition showing, for example,\nthat low and high dispersal rates can de-stabilize such systems. Here, we explore the impact of patch\n\n2\n\n\fspecific predators (preference) in a two-patch prey system connected by prey dispersal. The possibility\nthat one of the patches wll serve as a fragile prey refuge (Allee effect, [1]) has been recently analyzed\nin ([7]). Predator-prey systems where the prey has strong ties to its environment have also been\nconducted (see [16], [20]).\n1.2. Model Description\nA two-patch model consisting of a predator-prey system with a diffusely migrating prey is the\nstarting point of this manuscript. It is assumed that a fragile prey population (Allee effect, [1], [25])\nconnects (via its movements) two distinct habitats. We let u i \u2265 0, vi \u2265 0, i = 1,2 denote the\npopulation densities of the interacting preys and predators, respectively, in the i -th patch. The model's\nequations are:\n\u2032\nu1 = \u03b21 f (u1 ) \u2212 u1v1 + \u03b1 1 (u 2 \u2212 u1 ) \u2261 F1 (u1 , v1 , u 2 , v 2 ),\n\u2032\nv1 = \u03b3 1v1 (u1 \u2212 m1 ) \u2261 G1 (u1 , v1 , u 2 , v 2 ),\n\u2032\nu 2 = \u03b2 2 f (u 2 ) \u2212 u 2 v 2 + \u03b1 2 (u1 \u2212 u 2 ) \u2261 F2 (u1 , v1 , u 2 , v 2 ),\n\u2032\nv 2 = \u03b3 2 v 2 (u 2 \u2212 m2 ) \u2261 G2 (u1 , v1 , u 2 , v 2 ),\n\nwhere\n\n(1)\n\nf (u i ) = u i (u i \u2212 l i )(1 \u2212 u i )\n\n\u03b2 i > 0 characterize the rates of prey growth; 0 \u2264 li \u2264 1 denote the critical densities of the prey\npopulation; \u03b3 i \u2265 0 denote the coefficients of conversion of prey into predator biomass; mi \u2265 0 is a\nmeasure of the predators' adaptation to the preys; \u03b1 i \u2265 0 characterize migrations of preys in i -th\npatch.\nFirst, we focus on the \"symmetric\" case:\n\n\u03b1 1 = \u03b1 2 \u2261 \u03b1 , \u03b3 1 = \u03b3 2 \u2261 \u03b3 , m1 = m2 \u2261 m, l1 = l 2 \u2261 l , \u03b2 1 = \u03b2 2 = 1 ,\ncalling (1s) the symmetric system (1).\n\n3\n\n\f1.3. Overview of Subsystems\nThe mathematical analysis of Model (1s) advances through an approach that builds on the\nanalyses of lower dimensional sub-models, see Fig. 1. For example, we first consider the case\nwhen prey dispersal is impossible. Thus we have a pair of uncoupled predator-prey (two\ndimensional) systems. In each patch ( \u03b1 = 0 ) the model describes the dynamics of the densities\nof prey (u) and predator(v):\n\ndu\n= f (u ) \u2212 uv,\ndt\ndv\nv\u2032 \u2261\n= \u03b3v(u \u2212 m)\ndt\n\nu\u2032 \u2261\n\n(2)\n\nwhere f (u ) = u (u \u2212 l )(1 \u2212 u ) and parameters l , m, \u03b3 are defined as above.\n\nSystem (2) modifies and enhances the classical Volterra model. It has been proposed and investigated\nin prior works (see [5], [8], [28], etc). The phase-parameter portrait of system (2) is shown in Fig.2\nand is described below:\nTheorem 1.1. For any fixed positive \u03b3\n\n1) and parameters (l , m) \u2208 \u039c{0 \u2264 l \u2264 1, m \u2265 0} system (2) in the quadrant u \u2265 0, v \u2265 0 has equilibria\nO(0,0), O1 (1,0), Ol (l ,0) and equilibrium A(m, (m \u2212 l )(1 \u2212 m)) if 0 \u2264 l < m .\n2) the parameter space \u039c is divided into 5 regions of qualitatively different phase portraits of System\n(2). Boundaries between regions correspond to the bifurcations of co-dimension 1:\nS1: m = 1 and Sl: m = l , the appearance/disappearance of point A in the 1st quadrant by transcritical\n\nbifurcations with O1 , Ol , respectively;\n\n4\n\n\fH1 : m =\n\nl +1\n, the change of stability of A in the supercritical Andronov-Hopf bifurcation (with\n2\n\nappearance/disappearance of a stable limit cycle);\nL: m=m (l) the disappearance/ appearance of a stable limit cycle in a heteroclinics composed by the\n\nseparatrices of equilibria O1 and Ol.1.\n\nThus, the local (one-patch) Model (2) demonstrates the possibility of prey-predator coexistence in\nstable equilibrium or in oscillations if parameters are in the parameter domains 2 and 3 of Fig. 2 (see\nalso 3.1). We show in this work that prey dispersal between two bilocal (two-patch) models (1)\n\"originates\" new dynamical modes of population coexistence and essentially generalizes the\npossibility of population persistence.\n\nThe previous case when prey dispersal is impossible \u2013System (2)-sets the stage for the\nstudy of the predator-prey dynamics via the invasion of patch-specific predators. Hence, we also\nlook at the impact of dispersal on the dynamics of a two-patch predator-free environment. Let\nus note that system (1s), which was developed as a \"two-dimension \u03b1 \u2212 updating\" of Model (2)\ncan be considered also as a \"two-dimension updating\" of the model (see, [12], [13]):\n\n\u2032\nu1 = f (u1 ) + \u03b1 (u 2 \u2212 u1 ) = F1 (u1 ,0, u 2 ,0),\n\u2032\nu 2 = f (u 2 ) + \u03b1 (u1 \u2212 u 2 ) = F2 (u1 ,0, u 2 ,0),\n\n(3)\n\nwhich describes the dynamics of two Allee-type prey populations interacting diffusely. From this point\nof view System (1s) determines the role of predators in a population community. More exactly, it\nmodels how the behavior of the community Model (3) should change with the introduction of their\n\nCurve m(l) was found numerically in [5]; it was recalculated with help of the specific computer\nalgorithm in [28]\n1\n\n5\n\n\fpredators. As we will show later, dispersal in a predator-free two-patch environment where the prey\nmust reach a critical mass to survive can support up to nine equilibria including five boundary (one or\ntwo prey populations are absent) and four co-internal positive equilibria (both prey populations are\npresent) when the rate of dispersal is low.\nThe next subsystem that we consider is the situation when one patch faces predation while the other\nis a refuge (no access to predators). Model (1) can be thought up as a \"one-dimension updating\" of a\ntwo-patch models [7].\n\u2032\nu1 = f (u1 ) + \u03b1 (u 2 \u2212 u1 ) = F1 (u1 ,0, u 2 , v 2 ),\n\u2032\nu 2 = f (u 2 ) \u2212 u 2 v 2 + \u03b1 (u1 \u2212 u 2 ) = F2 (u1 ,0, u 2 , v 2 ),\n\u2032\nv 2 = \u03b3v 2 (u 2 \u2212 m) = G2 (u1 ,0, u 2 , v 2 )\n\n(4a)\n\nand\n\u2032\nu1 = f (u1 ) \u2212 u1v1 + \u03b1 (u 2 \u2212 u1 ) = F1 (u1 , v1 , u 2 ,0),\n\u2032\nv1 = \u03b3v1 (u1 \u2212 m) = G1 (u1 , v1 , u 2 ,0)\n\u2032\nu 2 = f (u 2 ) + \u03b1 (u1 \u2212 u 2 ) = F2 (u1 , v1 , u 2 ,0),\n\n(4b)\n\nwhich describe the dynamics of communities consisting of prey and predator when the prey can\ndisperse between both patches. Systems (4a) and (4b) differ only by designation of variables; we thus\nomit indices and refer to it as System (4). As we will show in later sections, when predators have\naccess to one patch (there is a predator-free or a prey-refuge) the system will support one to three\npositive equilibria (both prey populations and the predator surviving). These three-dimensional\npositive equilibrium points correspond to boundary (pre-prey plane) equilibria in the absence of the\npredator.\nWe show below that the dynamics of System (1s) includes the dynamics of (2), (3) and (4).\nIn other words, the two-dimensional prey-prey system is naturally embedded in the refuge-prey-\n\n6\n\n\fpredator system. Similarly, the refuge-prey-predator system is also naturally embedded in the full\npredator-prey-prey-predator system. Additionally, however, system (1s) produces its \"own\" non-trivial\n4D behaviors, including the equilibrium AA(m, (m \u2212 l )(1 \u2212 m), m, (m \u2212 l )(1 \u2212 m)) and additional\noscillations. These behaviors are of the main attention in this work. We will distinguish between\n\"trivial\" and \"non-trivial\" equilibria, the former having at least one zero-coordinate. A trivial\nequilibrium of Systems (1s) and (4) can arise from non-trivial equilibria of system (2) or system (3)\nand inherit some properties of the lower dimension equilibria. In an effort to understand the complete\ndynamics of the model community close to the non-trivial point AA we will analyze all equilibria of\nthe model and other non-trivial modes.\nSome of the equilibria have their coordinates given exactly while others have an asymptotic\nexpansion (explicitly to O(\u03b1) or O(\u03b12), see Table 1). We show that for 0 < l < m \u2264 1 the system can\nhave up to sixteen equilibria from which we distinguish \"strictly symmetric\" equilibria:\nu1 = u 2 , v1 = v 2 , \"three-dimensional\" equilibria possessing one zero-coordinate: v1 = 0 or v 2 = 0 ,\n\nand \"two-dimensional\" equilibria possessing two zero-coordinates: v1 = v 2 = 0 .\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sections 2 and 3 we analyze positions and stability of\nequilibrium points of model Systems (1s) and its subsystems. We consider also the problem of the\nchange of stability with increasing dimension of the subsystems. The results of this analysis in\nasymptotic (on \u03b1) form are done in Tables 1,2. In Section 4 we describe the global dynamics of the\nsubsystems in phase-parameter spaces. Section 5 contains the results of the analytical and computer\nanalysis of 4D-behaviors of the model (1s) that are presented in the form of phase-parameter portraits.\nDiscussion of the outcomes and their biological interpretations are done in Section 6.\n\n2.

Analysis of the equilibria as well as the boundaries (5), (6) was\ndone by expanding the functions F1 (u1 ,0, u 2 ,0), F2 (u1 ,0, u 2 ,0) in series in \u03b1 and considering the\nasymptotics explicitly to O(\u03b1 ) . Note, that equilibria C (u1 *, u 2 *) can be considered as those arising\nfrom two of the equilibria O0 , Ol , O1 of System (2) affected by the parameter \u03b1 .

Thus, when systems have three equilibria we call them\nB10 , B1l , B11 and B20 , B2l , B21 , respectively, whereas we call them B1 , B2 when systems have only\n\none equilibrium. As above, the analysis of coordinates of the equilibria as well as boundaries (7), (8)\nwas done by expanding the functions F1 (u1 ,0, u 2 , v 2 ), F2 (u1 , v1 , u 2 ,0) in series in \u03b1 and considering the\nasymptotics explicitly to O(\u03b1 ) or O(\u03b1 2 ) .\n\nThe result of the analysis is collected in\nProposition 2.2.

Dynamics of \"two/three-dimension subsystems\" of Model (1s)\n4.1. Dynamics of \"two/three-dimension subsystems\" of Model (2)\n\nNow we are ready to describe the dynamics of 2D-system (3) and 3D-system (4) whose\nbiological sense was discussed in the Introduction. The dynamics of model (2) are described mainly in\nthe Introduction. The phase-parameter diagram, which was given in Fig. 2, has the following\nbiological interpretation (for any fixed \u03b3 > 0 ). In domain 1 (m>1) predators go to extinction with any\ninitial density, whereas the prey go extinct or to the steady state u = 1 depending on whether\nu (t = 0) < l or u (t = 0) > l . In Domains 2 and 3 both prey and predator either coexist in steady state\noscillations or go to extinction depending on initial densities. Finally, in Domains 4 and 5 both\npopulations go to extinction for any initial data in spite of the fact that the model has positive nontrivial equilibrium in Domain 4.\nSystem (3) is the simplest form displaying the model dynamics of two Allee-type prey\npopulations interacting diffusely. The behavior of this system is defined completely by its equilibrium\n\n16\n\n\fpoints. It has from three (for big \u03b1 ) up to nine (for very small \u03b1 ) equilibria. For any parameters this\nsystem has two stable nodes, O00 (0,0) and O11 (1,1) , an unstable node Oll (l , l ) , and other equilibria\nthat are saddles when they exist. The parameter-phase portrait of the model is given in Fig.3.\nSystem (4) can be considered as a one-dimensional updating of System (3) in the case when a prey\npopulation has predators that control prey density. System (4) can be also considered as a onedimensional updating of System (2) for the case when a prey population can be replenished with\ndiffusely migrated preys. The bifurcation analysis of Model (4) provided by [6] and [7] have shown\nthat the behavior of System (4) is much more complicated and diverse than the behavior of systems (3)\nand (2). Here we describe some main properties of these dynamics.\nFor \u03b1 = 0 and \u03b3 = 1 values (l*, m*) are chosen in domain 4 of the parameter portrait of system\n(2) (see Fig.2) and give trajectories that tend to the origin from almost all initial data. (This case is\ninterpreted as the community going to extinction). Let B be an unstable non-trivial equilibrium of\nsystem (4).

Dynamics of System (1s)\n5.1. Change of stability of equilibrium AA\n\nThe (l,m)-parameter portrait of the local system (2), given in Fig.2, contains the boundary\ncurve H1: m =\n\nl +1\ncorresponding to an supercritical Andronov-Hopf bifurcation of equilibrium\n2\n\nA(m, v*) where v* = (m \u2212 l )(1 \u2212 m) . The eigenvalues of A are: \u03bb1, 2 ( A) = (mn \u00b1 ((mn) 2 \u2212 4m\u03b3v*) ) / 2\nwhere n = 1 + l \u2212 2m . The equation of H1 is defined by the vanishing of the real parts of l1, 2.\nAn \"image\" of A in the frame of the bilocal system (1) is a point AA(m, v*, m, v*) possessing\ntwo pair of eigenvalues:\n\n\u03bb1, 2 ( AA) = (mn \u00b1 ((mn) 2 \u2212 4m\u03b3v*) ) / 2, \u03bb3, 4 ( AA) = (mn \u2212 2\u03b1 ) \u00b1 ((mn \u2212 2\u03b1 ) 2 \u2212 4m\u03b3v*) ) / 2 .\nThe vanishing of the real parts of \u03bb1, 2 and \u03bb3, 4 defines the \"neutrality\" surface H (see Fig. 6)\nconsisting of two branches. There is the \"old\" branch\nH1{ \u03b3 , \u03b1 , m, l : m =\n\nl +1\n},\n2\n\nand the \"new\" branch (a parabola for any fixed \u03b3 , l ):\nH2{ \u03b3 ,\u03b1 , m, l : \u03b1 =\n\nm(l + 1 \u2212 2m)\n}.\n2\n\nProposition 5.1. Let 0 < l < m . Equilibrium AA(m, v*, m, v*) of System (1s) located in the first orthant\n\nof the (u1 , v1 , u 2 , v 2 ) -phase space, changes stability in supercritical Andronov-Hopf bifurcations with\n\n18\n\n\fparameter values belonging to surface H1 for any \u03b3 > 0 , and with parameter values belonging to\nsurface H2 for any 0 < \u03b3 \u2264 1 .\nProof. We have calculated the first Lyapunov quantities L1 at H1 and H2 (see [3], [19]). Applying the\nprocedure contained in [15] we obtained the following results.\nLet v0 = (m \u2212 l )(1 \u2212 m) is v1 = v 2 -coordinate of equilibrium AA. Then\nL1 ( H 1 ) = \u2212c1\n\n1+ l\n,\n2\u03b3v0\n\nand\nL1 ( H 2 ) = c 2 (\u22128\u03b1 2 (4 + 4l \u2212 \u03b3 \u2212 6m) \u2212 9(1 + l )\u03b3mv0 \u2212 2\u03b1 ((8 + 8l 2 + 2\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b3 2 + 2l (8 + \u03b3 ))m \u2212\n6(8 + 8l + \u03b3 )m 2 + 72m 3 + 2\u03b3mv0 )),\nwhere \u03b1 = m(l + 1 \u2212 2m) / 2.\nHere c1 , c 2 are positive constants.\nIt is evident that L1 ( H 1 ) < 0 . Analysis of formula L1 ( H 2 ) has been done numerically. We found\nL1 ( H 2 ) < 0 and have also verified the results using the LOCBIF\u2013packages [17]. This completes the\nproof.\nWe note that our computer experiments with system (1) revealed that the stable cycle, which\nappears when crossing the boundary H2, disappears with parameter values very close to those in H2,\nannihilating with an unstable limit cycle. Because of this we did not mention the domain of its\nexistence in the parameter portrait of system (1s), see Fig.7, and denote H2 by dotted line there. The\nstable cycle, which appears crossing the boundary H1 exists a wide parameter domain; we call this\ncycle cu.\n5.2. 4D-oscillations in System (1s)\n\n19\n\n\fComputational analysis of the system (1s) reveals the complicated structure of its dynamics,\nwhich essentially depends on parameter values of the system as well as on initial values of the\nvariables. Of course, due to biological interpretations of the model (1s) our main interest is in the\nstable modes, which can be observed with variations of initial data. We show that even for fixed\nparameters the system can demonstrate wide range multistability. In addition, the existence of\nmigration in our model increases diversity of stable modes thereby increasing the sustainability of the\nmodel community.\nThe schematic parameter portrait of the system for some typical 4D-rearrangements of model\nbehaviors in a phase neighborhood of point AA is presented in Fig. 6. The portrait represents an\n(\u03b1 , m) \u2212 cut of the four-dimensional (\u03b1 , \u03b3 , m, l ) \u2212 parameter space for fixed values \u03b3 = 1 and\n0 < l = .1 < m < 1 , such that (l , m) belongs to Domain 4 or adjacent to the boundary L Domain 3 in\n\nFig.2. The portrait was obtained by analytical and computer methods of the bifurcation theory with\nthe use of packages TRAX [21] and LOCBIF [17]. The analytically obtained curves H1, H2 of\nAndronov-Hopf bifurcations were described above. The 3D-rearrangements of model behavior (see\nFig.5) are not presented in this portrait and will be discussed later.\nIn Domain I of the parameter portrait the model has stable four-dimension equilibrium AA.\nIn Domain II of the parameter portrait the model has stable oscillations corresponding to the\nstable four-dimensional limit cycle \"\u0441u\" in (u1 , v1 , u 2 , v 2 ) - phase space. This cycle appears when we\ncross boundary H1 from bigger to smaller m (from right to left in Fig.6) and exists for any value of\nparameter \u03b1 \u2265 0 (see Fig. 7). Its \"pre-image\" in system (2) also appeared in a supercritical AndronovHopf bifurcation after crossing boundary H (see Fig.2). Recall that H and H1 have the same equation,\nand equilibrium AA loses stability in the two-dimensional eigen-space at boundary H1, whereas the\nother two-dimensional eigen-space corresponds to trajectories tending to AA with t \u2192 \u221e . Computer\n\n20\n\n\fanalysis of cycle \u0441u (see Fig. 7) has shown that \u0441u disappears at heteroclinics composed by separatrices\nof the trivial symmetric equilibria O ll ,O 11 , analogous to its pre-image which has disappeared at\nheteroclinics of Ol ,O1 . The parametric boundary corresponding to the mentioned heteroclinics is\ndenoted L1 in the portrait and schematically presented as a straight line. With fixed value of l lines L1\nin Fig.6 and L in Fig.2 has a common point for \u03b1 = 0 : (l = .1, m \u2248 .446) .\n\nIn Domain III the model has only one 4D-attractor \u2013equilibrium at the origin.\nModel (1s) demonstrates its most interesting 4D-behavior in Domains IV and V bounded by\ncurve F at the portrait (see Fig.4). Our computer analysis has revealed that for very small \u03b1 (close to\nthe boundary SC1 in Fig.3) and certain m, separatrices of trivial two-dimensional equilibria C10 ,C 01\ngives rise to four-dimensional limit cycle c4 (see Fig.8a, where \u03b1 = .001 and both cycles c4 and \u0441u are\npresented). For fixed values of l increasing \u03b1 results in c4 undergoing period-doubling, whereby it\nloses its stability transforming to a torus, etc., depending on the value of m for which we consider this\ncycle. Fig.-s 9a and 9b, where m = .45 , \u03b1 = .0256 and \u03b1 = .0235 respectively, display the stages of\nperiod-doubling of c4 in Domain IV. In Fig.9b one can observe period-doubling in more detail; it is\nclear from this picture that domains of attraction of \u0441u and c4 are divided by an unstable manifold\nsimilar to a limit cycle. Note that c4 is destroyed at domain IV under some period-doubling,\npresumably, Feigenbaum doubling that \"originates\" a cycle of period 3 which leads to the appearance\nof weak chaos dynamics [27], [22]. In considering the model with l = .1 the destruction of cycle c4\nwas observed at the boundary F for m = .48,\u03b1 \u2248 .0183 (see Fig. 10a) as well as for m = .446,\u03b1 \u2248 .0256\n(see Fig. 10b); note, that these pictures contain both cycles c4 and \u0441u.\n\nIn Domain V increasing \u03b1 results in cycle c4 transforming to a torus (when m decreases, see\nFig-s. 11, 12). This torus possessing irrational rotating number (see Fig.12, m=.325 with \u03b1=.0332) is\n21\n\n\fdestroyed by the appearance of a rational rotation number (see Fig. 12b, m=.325 with \u03b1=.0333) and\nchaotic dynamics result (see [14] for theory of general torus destruction).\n\nIn Fig.13 we show portraits of the system for m = .315,\u03b1 = .027 ; this parameter point is placed\nclose to the boundary F of Domains V and III. The portraits display two stable manifolds: two-leaf\ntorus c4 and three-dimensional cycle c3; initial points in their basins are distinguished only in their ucoordinate, u=.01 for the former and u=0 for the latter.\nRecall that for small enough \u03b1 and m <\n\n1+ l\nsystem (1s) has two stable \"three-dimensional\"\n2\n\nlimit cycles \u044131 and \u044132 at spaces (u1 , v1 , u 2 ,0) and (u1 ,0, u 2 , v 2 ) (see Fig. 5).These cycles appear from\nheteroclinics composed by two-dimensional trivial equilibria C l 0 ,C10 and C 0l ,C 01 (at value \u03b1 = \u03b1 * in\nFig. 5) and disappear at supercritical Andronov-Hopf bifurcation with parameter value \u03b1 = \u03b1 * * in\nFig. 4. Note that cycles \u044131 and \u044132 continue to exist in subspaces (u1 , v1 , u 2 ,0) and (u1 ,0, u 2 , v 2 ) of\nspace (u1 , v1 , u 2 , v 2 ) and are stable if the initial values belong to these subspaces (see, for example,\nFig.-s 10b and 13). Thus, for a wide range of parameters system (1s) simultaneously has 4D- and 3Dattractors, limit cycles. The origin equilibrium is stable for any parameter values, though its basin of\nattraction can vary. Thus, the model community can tend to one of these depending on initial values.\n\n6. Discussion. Biological Interpretations\n\nIt is useful to compare dynamics of the three models described by the two-dimensional System\n(2), three-dimensional System (4), and four-dimension System (1s).\nThe model of the local (one patch) community (2) predicts four different regimes of dynamical\nbehavior: getting predators to extinction with any initial density because the death rate of predators is\n\n22\n\n\ftoo large; possibility of predator-prey coexistence at steady state or stable oscillations for a wide range\nof initial densities; getting preys and predators to extinction because predators over-regulate prey\ndensity.\nThe model of two-patch community (4) consisting of preys and predator-preys systems can\nhave up to thirteen equilibrium points, both trivial (with at least one zero coordinate) and non-trivial.\nFor suitable dispersal prey rates between both patches, the predator can control the numbers of both\nprey populations in a stable stationary equilibrium or in oscillatory regimes. It was revealed also that\n\"trivial\" two-dimensional equilibrium points in the frame of Model (4) \"originate\" oscillations in the\ncommunity after their separatrices compose heteroclinics. The most \"interesting\" and diverse\nbehaviors of this model are observed close to boundaries of population coexistence. Regimes of bistability or tri-stability were found: depending on initial data the model community can coexist at a\nnon-trivial stable equilibrium, at stable oscillations, or go extinct. It is important to note that both\nsystems in the model community can survive for parameter values for which any one of them would\ngo to extinction for all initial densities in isolation.\nThe Model (1s) describing dynamics of the two-patch predator-prey system supports more\ndiversity of stable modes when compared with Model (4). In fact, it can have up to sixteen equilibria\nand up to seven stable limit cycles in the 1-st orthant. We have analyzed Model (1s) mainly for small\nvalues of the dispersal parameter \u03b1 with fixed values for the Malthusian parameter \u03b3 \u2248 1 . The main\nattention was on the investigation of the 4D-modes. Results of the analyses are collected in the\nschematic parameter portrait in Fig.6 as an (\u03b1 , m) \u2212 cut of the four-dimensional (\u03b1 , \u03b3 , m, l ) \u2212\nparameter space obtained by fixing \u03b3 = 1 and 0 < l = .1 < m < 1 . We follow the modes of the stable\ncommunity dynamics by changing the parameters m and \u03b1 . The parameter portrait of the system is\ndivided into 5 domains comprising different 4D-phase behaviors of the model. We found the\n\n23\n\n\fboundaries H1, H2 corresponding to the change of stability of non-trivial 4D-equilibria in a\nsupercritical Andronov-Hopf bifurcation. The boundaries L1 and F in the portrait correspond to nonlocal bifurcations in the model, \"heteroclinics\" of equilibrium points, and limit cycles. We showed, for\nexample, that for parameter values belonging to domain IV the model community can support up to\nfour stable nontrivial modes under suitable initial values: oscillations corresponding to two 4D limit\n\ncycles as well as those corresponding to two 3D limit cycles were found. The size of the basins of\nattraction of these cycles depend on parameters, we observed and analyzed the changing of form and\nthe range of the oscillations when \u03b1 increased. We observed period doubling leading to aperiodic,\npossibly chaotic oscillations similar to those described in [27] and [22]. In addition, we observed the\nformation and destruction of a torus as the rotation number moves from irrational to rational (a known\nroute to chaos-see [14]). Note, that decreases in the parameter m, which lead to the extinction of the\npredator-prey system in one patch, do not necessarily lead to the \"immediate\" extinction of the\ncommunity for suitable values of \u03b1 . In fact, m and \u03b1 combinations result in communities that persist\nperiodically, aperiodically, or chaotically oscillating.\nThe two limit cycles cu and c4 can be biologically interpreted as follows: 4D-\"oscillations cu\"\nare originated from 2D- oscillations that live in one-patch Models (2), persist for any \u03b1 in Domain II\n(in the frame of (1s)). 4D-\"oscillations c4\" arise due to the structure of Model (1s) for very small \u03b1\nand reflect the ability of populations to coexist in a rather extreme oscillatory regime, under weak\ndispersal, see the limit cycle in Fig. 8b. As the parameter \u03b1 increases or the parameter m decreases\nthese regular oscillations move into a period-doubling regime or in a torus \u2013 a typical route to\ndestruction in the chaotic regime. In other words, excessive dispersal or low mortality predator death\n(given predators the opportunity to eat all the prey) leads to the system extinction in a rather exotic\nway.\n\n24\n\n\f3D-oscillations, which are one of the stable modes of a system of one predator- two preys (see\nModel (4)), coexist simultaneously with 4D-oscillations; small changes in the predators' initial\ndensities can shift the dynamics from 3D-stable oscillations to 4-D stable oscillations and vice-versa.\n3-D oscillations are more robust, that is, the 4D-oscillations may die while the 3-D survive.\nThese model outcomes also hold, supported by numerical analysis, in the non-symmetric\nversion of the model. We also considered the case where the Allee parameters l1 and l2 were not\nidentical. There we observed the appearance of new stable modes together with the old one (see\nFig.14a,b).\nFurther investigation can follow by considering a fully non-symmetrical system (1).\n\nAcknowledgment.\n\nThe authors greatly appreciate to Dr. N.
