The usual treatment of a (first order) classical field theory such\nas electromagnetism has a little drawback: It has a primary constraint submanifold that arise from the fact that the dynamics is governed by the antisymmetric part of the jet variables. So it is natural to ask if there exists a\nformulation of this kind of field theories which avoids this problem, retaining\nthe versatility of the known approach. The following paper deals with a family\nof variational problems, namely, the so called non standard variational problems, which intends to capture the data necessary to set up such a formulation\nfor field theories; moreover, we will formulate a multisymplectic structure for\nthe family of non standard variational problems, and we will relate this with\nthe (pre)symplectic structure arising on the space of sections of the bundle of\nfields. In this setting the Dirac theory of constraints will be studied, obtaining\namong other things a novel characterization of the constraint manifold which\narises in this theory, as generators of an exterior differential system associated\nto the equations of motion and the chosen slicing. Several examples of application of this formalism are discussed: Two of them motivated from the physical\npoint of view, that is, electromagnetism and Poisson sigma models, and two\nexamples of mathematical application. In the case of electromagnetism, it is\nshown that this formulation avoids the problems arising in the usual approach.\n\n1. Introduction. In this work, the term field theory will refer to a particular kind\nof variational problems on the sections of some bundle on space-time (for definitions, see section 2). In the usual approach, the Dirac constraints in a field theory are found using the Gotay-Nester-Hinds algorithm on an infinite dimensional\npresymplectic manifold associated to the underlying variational problem. One of\nthe purposes of this article is to show another way to build up these constraints,\nnamely, by using a geometrical representation of the corresponding Euler-Lagrange\nequations into the exterior algebra of a bundle. The tools used for this task were\ntaken from the theory of exterior differential systems (EDS from now on, for references see appendix B). In this way the Cauchy-Kowalevsky existence theorem can\nbe introduced into the realm of field theory; on the contrary, the usual setting has\nto do with functional analytic conditions, hiding these existence conditions into the\n(infinite dimensional) manifold structure.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification.

Dirac constraints, Exterior differential systems, Classical field theory.\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nSANTIAGO CAPRIOTTI\n\nIn more precise terms, the variational problems we are concerned with are initially\ncharacterized by a double fibration\n\u039b \u2192 \u039b1 \u2192 M n\ntogether with an exterior differential system I \u2282 \u03a9\u2022 (\u039b) and an n-form \u03bb. These\nkind of problems will be called non standard variational problems throughout the\nwork. The idea for this formulation can be traced back to [18], for the case in\nwhich the base manifold has dimension n = 1; another work on the subject, in the\nsame vein, can be found in [21]. It is worth remarking that both references provide\nexamples from geometry (not only mechanics) where this scheme can be applied.\nThe basic idea is that, for every section \u03c3 of the bundle \u039b1 , we can build a section\npr\u03c3 for the bundle \u039b by using these data (see details below); the non standard\nproblem consists of finding those sections \u03c3 of the bundle \u039b1 which are extremals\nof the functional\n\u02c6\n\u2217\nS\u03bb [\u03c3] :=\n(pr\u03c3) \u03bb.\nM\n\nThis setting includes what can be called standard variational problems, like the\nusual Lagragian mechanics and the lagrangian viewpoint of first order field theories\nas in [15]: For example, in the latter case the bundle \u039b1 corresponds to the bundle\nof fields, \u039b is the 1-jet space of sections for this bundle, and the prolongation of a\nsection \u03c3 is given by its 1-jet j 1 \u03c3.\nOur aim is twofold:\n1. In first place, to set up an infinite dimensional presymplectic manifold with\na hamiltonian for every non standard variational problem. This is done by\nappealing to a bivariant Lepagean equivalent variational problem associated\nto the non standard problem; it provides us with a multisymplectic-like structure, and introducing an slicing of the bundle where this structure lives, the\npresymplectic manifold can be defined.\n2. Secondly, we want to prove that the Dirac constraints obtained from the successful application of Gotay-Nester algorithm to the data found in the previous\nitem can be calculated as the generators of some EDS closely related to the\n(Lepagean equivalent) variational problem. We must remark here that these\nconstraints generalize in some sense the Dirac constraints to the non standard\nsetting: The usual Dirac constraints can be found through this procedure by\nusing the canonical Lepage equivalent (in the sense of definition 2.4 below)\nfor a first order field theory on the 1-jet bundle associated to the bundle of\nfields, as shown in example 11.\nThe present article is structured as follows: In section 2 the non standard variational problem is defined, and some relevant examples are presented. In particular,\nit is shown that several dynamical problems of mathematical physics can be formulated as non standard problems; as a particular example, we discuss in this setting\nthe electromagnetism. The Euler-Lagrange equations of the non standard problem\nare found here, and the ideas of Lepage equivalent and canonical Lepage equivalent\nsystem associated to a non standard variational problem are introduced. This gives\nus a kind of multisymplectic structure for every non standard variational problem.\nIt is important to note that no use of Legendre transform is made in the construction of this multisymplectic space; the main disadvantage of this approach is that\nthe equivalence between the original equations of motion and the equations of motion in the multisymplectic space must be done in each case separately (this is an\n\n\fCONSTRAINTS, FIELD THEORY AND EDS\n\n3\n\nissue related to the so called bivariance of the chosen Lepage equivalent problem,\nsee below). By adding a compatible slicing of the space-time, a Hamiltonian version\nof the equations governing the extremals is developed in section 3: it is described a\nprocedure that associates a presymplectic manifold (infinite dimensional if n > 1)\nand a function on it to every (Lepagean equivalent of a) non standard problem.\nMoreover it is proved here that the solutions of the dynamical system determined\nby these data are extremals of the underlying variational problem. Section 4 contains the main result of the article, which deals with the description of the constraint\nsubmanifold arising from the Gotay-Nester algorithm [17] in terms of an exterior\ndifferential system associated to the data of the theory. The section 5 contains\nfour examples where these considerations are applied. The first two constitues the\nexamples with physical content, namely, electromagnetism and the Poisson sigma\nmodel, and the last two explores other aspects of the method: the calculation of\nintegrability conditions for a system of PDEs via Gotay-Nester algorithm, and a toy\nmodel where this algorithm fails to reach a succesful termination. The relevance of\nthe last example is that its features could be related to the singular behaviour of\nsome field theories (cf. remark 5.7). We show also how the EDS perspective help\nus in the interpretation of the results. A note of caution about these examples is in\norder here: It will be assumed that there exists a well-defined differential structure\non the sets of sections which we work with, so several of the manipulations in this\ncontext are of formal nature.\nIt is worth noting that the idea giving rise to the definition of the EDS associated\nto the constraints is an extension of the one used in [19] for the treatment of classical mechanics from the EDS viewpoint. Similar results, but from the viewpoint\nof Janet-Riquier theory, instead of Cartan's EDSs, and oriented to the construction\nof an algorithm, can be found in [28, 29, 12, 11]. The introductory material about\nvariational calculus and exterior differential systems was deferred to Appendices A\nand B.\nNotation. Given a bundle F \u2192 B, \u0393 (F ) denotes the set of differentiable sections of this bundle. The subbundle V F \u2282 T F denotes the set of vertical vectors.\nThe symbol \u03a9\u2022 (X) indicates the set of forms of any order on the manifold X, and\ncorrespondingly \u03a9k (X) is the set of k-forms on X. Although in some cases this\nfact was proved (see proposition 6 below), it is assumed that some vector fields defined on certain subsets of the bundles which we work with admits an extension to\na neighborhood of these subsets. We do not discuss the convergence of the integrals used elsewhere; it is supposed that the hypothesis ensuring its convergence are\nsatisfied. The notation \u03c4X (resp. \u03c4\u0304X ) used in [1] in order to denote the canonical projection of the tangent bundle (resp. cotangent bundle) of X is adopted. If\ni : Y \u0592\u2192 X is the canonical injection of some submanifold Y of X, the symbol\nTY X will denotes the pullback bundle i\u2217 (T X). Given a set of forms S \u2282 \u03a9\u2022 (X)\nwe denote by hSialg \u2282 \u03a9\u2022 (X) the algebraic ideal generated by these forms, and by\nhSidiff \u2282 \u03a9\u2022 (X) the minimal algebraic ideal containing S and is closed with respect\nto the exterior derivative operator. If S \u2282 V is a set of vectors in the vector space\nV , we indicate by hSi the subspace spanned by the vectors in S.\n2. Formal structure for variational problems. The essential data in both the\nformulation of the usual field theories [15, 16, 2] and classical mechanics [1, 19] are\np\n\u03c01\nM (with composition \u03c0 := \u03c01 \u25e6 p),\nthe following: A double fibration \u039b \u2212\u2192 \u039b1 \u2212\u2192\n\u2022\nan exterior differential system I \u2282 \u03a9 (\u039b) and a semibasic n-form \u03bb \u2208 \u03a9n (\u039b), where\n\n\f4\n\nSANTIAGO CAPRIOTTI\n\nn = dim M . In terms of these objects, the prolongation of a section \u03c3 \u2208 \u0393 (\u039b1 ) can\nbe defined as a section pr\u03c3 \u2208 \u0393 (\u039b) such that\n1. Its graph is an integral submanifold for I, that is, pr\u03c3 \u2217 (I) = 0, and\n2. The section pr\u03c3 covers \u03c3, that is, the following diagram is commutative\n\u039b\n\u2712\n\npr\u03c3\n\nM\n\np\n\n\u2744\n\u2732 \u039b1\n\u03c3\n\nHence we introduce the action as a real-valued function on the set of sections of \u039b1\n\u02c6\n(pr\u03c3)\u2217 (\u03bb) .\nS [\u03c3] :=\nM\n\nDefinition 2.1 (Non standard variational problem). In the previous setting, the\nnon standard variational problem consists in finding sections \u03c3 \u2208 \u0393 (\u039b1 ) which are\nextremals of the action S.\nThe usual point of view in geometric mechanics is to take the contact structure\non jet manifolds as the basic prolongation structure for the underlying variational\nproblem; in this view it is a piece in the formalism. The non standard approach\nconsists in the weakening of this assumption, regarding the prolongation structure\nas an additional data of the problem, related to some aspects of its underlying\ngeometry. The following examples may help us to clarify this assertion. Moreover,\nthey are in order to illustrate the ubiquity of this notion; subsequent sections in the\narticle will intend to show its usefulness.\nExample 1 (Classical Mechanics). Taking M := I \u2282 R a real interval, Q a manifold, \u039b1 := Q \u00d7 I and \u039b := T Q \u00d7 I, with \u03c01 (q, t) = t and p (q, q\u0307; t) = (q, t),\nchoosing as the prolongation EDS the differential ideal generated by the forms\n\u03b8i := dq i \u2212 q\u0307 i dt, and with \u03bb := Ldt, we obtain the usual variational problem of the\nclassical mechanics. In this case if we have that \u03c3 : t 7\u2192 (q (t) , t), then\n\u0013\n\u0012\ndq\n(t) ; t\npr\u03c3 : t 7\u2192 q (t) ,\ndt\nis the formula defining the prolongation of sections.\n\nExample 2 (First order field theories). The following example show how first order\nfield theories fits in our scheme, that is, how one might formulate a first order field\ntheory as a non standard problem. So let us suppose that the fields are sections of\n\u03c0\ncertain bundle F \u2212\u2192 M on space-time. The double fibration is in this case\n\u03c01,0\n\n\u039b := J 1 (\u03c0) \u2212\u2192 \u039b := J 0 (\u03c0) = F \u2192 M,\nwhere J k (\u03c0) denotes the k-jet manifold of F . By taking on J 1 (\u03c0) the contact EDS\n\u0001\nas prolongation structure, it can be shown that pr\u03c3 = j 1 \u03c3.

An arbitrary element of \u039b is given by a pair (F, A) where F \u2208 2 (Tm\nM)\n\u2217\nand A \u2208 Tm M for some m \u2208 M . For every k \u2208 N there exists a canonical k-form\nVk \u2217\non\n(T M ) defined by\n\u039b1 : =\n\n\u0398k |\u03b1 := \u03b1 \u25e6 \u03c4\u0304M\u2217 ,\n\n\u2200\u03b1 \u2208\n\nk\n^\n\n(T \u2217 M ) ;\n\nas prolongation EDS I we take the differential ideal generated by the form\n\u0393 := d\u03981 \u2212 \u03982 .\nSo a section m 7\u2192 (F (m) , A (m)) of \u039b is an integral section for I iff F = dA.\nExample 4 (EDS as a non standard problem). This is the first example of a non\nstandard problem of mathematical nature: Every EDS I on a bundle F \u2192 M can\nbe considered as a non standard problem, by using the double fibration\nid\n\nF \u2192 M \u2212\u2192 M,\nwith prolongation structure I and lagrangian n-form \u03bb = 0. Therefore the intermediate bundle has just one section, namely \u03c30 = idM , and the possible prolongations\nof it are the integral sections of I. Later on we will use this remark in order to\nemploy the Gotay-Nester algorithm in searching the integrability conditions of a\nsystem of PDEs (see example in section 5.5).\nExample 5 (Tetrad gravity). Let M be a pseudoriemannian 4-manifold. Let us\nintroduce a formulation of the variational problem for tetrad gravity on M in these\nterms. The fields in this case are the components e\u03bc \u2208 \u03a91 (M ) , \u03bc = 0, * * * , 3 of\na tetrad on the spacetime M . The natural \"velocities\" for such an object are not\nits prolongation into J 1 (\u03c4\u0304M ); instead, it is more geometric to take as velocities\nfor a tedrad the associated connection forms \u03c9\u03bc\u03bd \u2208 \u03a91 (M ). Thus it is possible to\nformulate tetrad gravity as a non standard problem on the double fibration\nFO\u2217 (M ) \u2295 (T \u2217 M )\u22954 \u2192 FO\u2217 (M ) \u2192 M\nwhere p\u0304M : FO\u2217 (M ) \u2192 M stands for the coframe bundle on M , with prolongation\nstructure generated by the forms\n\u03bd\n\u0398\u03b1 := dE \u03b1 \u2212 \u03a9\u03b1\n\u03bd \u2227 E , \u03bd = 0, * * * , 3.\n\nHere with capital letters we denote the corresponding canonical forms. The lagrangian is the scalar curvature, so\n\u0001\n\u03bb := \u22c6 E \u03b1 \u2227 E \u03b2 \u2227 (d\u03a9\u03b1\u03b2 + \u03a9\u03bd\u03b1 \u2227 \u03a9\u03bd\u03b2 ) .\n\nThe prolongation means that it is a torsionless connection.\n\n\f6\n\nSANTIAGO CAPRIOTTI\n\nThe purpose of the forthcoming sections is to show that in the non standard\nsetting it is possible to build a reasonable multisymplectic space and even to deal\nwith its Dirac constraints, althought no use of Legendre transformation will be made\nin the process. But first let us show how the Euler-Lagrange equations for a non\nstandard variational problem can be built.\n2.1. Euler-Lagrange equations for non standard variational problems. In\norder to perform variations on the class of functionals relevant to our study, we\nneed to adapt the proposition 7 to the case in which the section involved in the\nintegrand is the prolongation of another one by using some prolongation structure.\nTo this end, let us introduce the following definition.\nDefinition 2.2. An (infinitesimal) allowed variation for a non standard variational problem with prolongation structure given by the EDS I is an element\nV \u2208 \u0393 (\u03c3 \u2217 (V \u039b)) , \u03c3 \u2208 \u0393 (I) admitting an extension V\u0302 \u2208 \u0393 (V \u039b) \u2282 X (\u039b) which\nis an infinitesimal symmetry for I, that is\n\u0001\n\u03c3 \u2217 LV\u0302 I = 0.\nIt is assumed, unless explicitly stated, that whenever a manifold has a boundary,\nthe allowed variations annihilates on this boundary. Then we have the following\nproposition [13, 18].\nProposition\n1. The Euler-Lagrange equations associated to the functional S [\u03c3] =\n \u0301\n(pr\u03c3)\u2217 \u03bb defined on \u0393 (\u039b1 ) are given by\nM\n\u2217\n\n(pr\u03c3) (V yd\u03bb) \u2261 0 mod exact n-forms on \u039b,\n\u0001\nwhere V \u2208 \u0393 (pr\u03c3)\u2217 (V \u039b) is an arbitrary allowed variation.\n\nExample 6 (Electromagnetism - Cont.). We return to the electromagnetic field in\norder to find the Euler-Lagrange equations for the lagrangian \u03bb := \u03982 \u2227 \u2217\u03982 ; here\n\u2217\u03982 |\u03b1 := (\u2217\u03b1) \u25e6 \u03c4\u0304M\u2217\nby using the Hodge star associated to the spacetime metric. Now, as in every\nvector bundle, the vertical space can be identified at each point with the fibre\nthrough that point, so any vertical vector field on \u039b can be denoted as an application\n(F, A) \u2208 \u039b 7\u2192 (\u03b4F, \u03b4A) \u2208 \u03c0 \u22121 (\u03c0 (F, A)) \u2243 V(F,A) \u039b. This identification has the\nfollowing interesting property: For the Lie derivative the following holds\n(L\u03b4\u03b1 \u0398k ) |\u03b1 = \u03b4\u03b1 \u25e6 \u03c4\u0304M\u2217 ,\n\n\u2200\u03b1 \u2208\n\nk\n^\n\n(T \u2217 M ) .\n\nSo if V := (\u03b4F, \u03b4A) is an allowed variation with extension V\u0302 :=\nvertical vector field on \u039b, this extension must be such that\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u02c6 , \u03b4A\n\u02c6 to a\n\u03b4F\n\nL(\u03b4F\n\u02c6 ,\u03b4A\n\u02c6 ) (d\u03981 \u2212 \u03982 ) = \u03bc (d\u03981 \u2212 \u03982 )\nfor some function \u03bc \u2208 C \u221e (\u039b). By restricting to the integral submanifold Im (pr\u03c3) , \u03c3 \u2208\n\u0393 (I) we obtain the following differential condition\nd\u03b4A \u2212 \u03b4F = 0.\nThen the Euler-Lagrange equations are expressed as\n2d\u03b4A \u2227 \u2217F \u2261 0\n\n\u21d4\n\n\u03b4A \u2227 d (\u2217F ) \u2261 0\n\nto which the prolongation condition must be added\nF = dA.\n\n\u21d4\n\nd (\u2217F ) = 0\n\n\fCONSTRAINTS, FIELD THEORY AND EDS\n\n7\n\n2.2. (Multi)hamiltonian formalism through Lepagean equivalent problems. We want to construct a hamiltonian version for the non standard variational\nproblem. The usual approach [15] seems useless here, because of the following facts:\n\u2022 The covariant multimomentum space is a bundle in some sense dual to the\nvelocity space, which is a jet space.\n\u2022 The dynamics in the multimomentum space is defined through the Legendre\ntransform, and it is not easy to generalize to a non standard problem this\nnotion.\nThe trick to circumvect the difficulties is to mimic the passage from Hamilton's\nprinciple to Hamilton-Pontryaguin principle. This is done by including the generators of the prolongation structure in the lagrangian density by means of a kind of\nLagrange multipliers. This procedure will be formalized below, where the hamiltonian version is defined by associating a first order variational problem to the non\nstandard variational problem, whose extremals are in one to one correspondence\nwith its extremals. This is called canonical bivariant Lepage equivalent problem.\n2.2.1. Lepagean equivalent problems. Here we will follow closely the exposition of\nthe subject in the article [13]. Before going into details, let us introduce a bit of\n\u03c0\nterminology: If \u039b \u0010\n\u2212\u2192 M is a bundle,\n\u03bb \u2208 \u03a9n (\u039b) (n = dim M ) and I is an EDS\n\u0011\n\u03c0\non \u039b, the symbol \u039b \u2212\u2192 M, I, \u03bb indicates the variational problem consisting in\nextremize the action\n\u02c6\n\u03c3 \u2217 (\u03bb)\n\nS [\u03c3] =\n\nM\n\nwith \u03c3 \u2208 \u0393 (\u039b) restricted to the set\u0010 of integral sections\nof I. Furthermore, E (\u03bb)\n\u0011\n\u03c0\nwill denote the set of extremals for \u039b \u2212\u2192 M, I, \u03bb .\nThe idea is to eliminate in some way the constraints imposed by the elements\nof I; intuitively, it is expected that the number of unknown increase when this is\ndone. The following concept captures these ingredients formally.\nDefinition 2.3 (Lepage\nproblem). A Lepagean equivalent of\n\u0010 equivalent variational\n\u0011\n\u03c0\na variational problem \u039b \u2212\u2192 M, I, \u03bb is another variational problem\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u03c1\n\u039b\u0303 \u2212\u2192 M, {0} , \u03bb\u0303\ntogether with a surjective submersion \u03bd : \u039b\u0303 \u2192 \u039b such that\n\n\u2022 \u03c1 = \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03bd,\n\u0010 and\n\u0011\n\u2022 if \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393 \u039b\u0303 is such that \u03bd \u25e6 \u03b3 is an integral section of I, then\n\u2217\n\n\u03b3 \u2217 \u03bb\u0303 = (\u03bd \u25e6 \u03b3) \u03bb.\n\nThere exists a canonical way to\u0010 build up a Lepage\nequivalent problem associated\n\u0011\n\u03c0\nto a given variational problem \u039b \u2212\u2192 M, I, \u03bb , the so called canonical Lepage\nequivalent problem.\nV\u2022 \u2217Let I be differentially generated by the sections of a graded\n(T \u039b) (this is a \"constant rank\" hypothesis, ensuring the existence\nsubbundle I \u2282\nof a bundle in the construction, see below). Define I alg as the algebraic ideal in\n\u03a9\u2022 (\u039b) generated by \u0393 (I), and\n\u0001l\nI alg := I alg \u2229 \u03a9l (\u039b) .\n\n\f8\n\nSANTIAGO CAPRIOTTI\n\nVn \u2217\nFor \u03bb \u2208 \u03a9n (\u039b), define the affine subbundle W \u03bb \u2282\n(T \u039b) whose fiber above\np \u2208 \u039b is\nn\n\u0001n o\n.\nW \u03bb p := \u03bb|p + \u03b2|p : \u03b2 \u2208 I alg\n\nDefinition 2.4 \u0010(Canonical Lepage \u0011equivalent problem). In the previous setting,\n\u03c1\nit is the triple W \u03bb \u2212\u2192 M, {0} , \u0398\u0303 , where \u03bd is the canonical projection \u03c4\u0304\u039bn :\nVn \u2217\n(T \u039b) \u2192 \u039b restricted to W \u03bb , \u03c1 := \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03bd and \u0398\u0303 is the pullback of the canonical\nn-form\n\u0398n |\u03b1 := \u03b1 \u25e6 (\u03c4\u0304\u039bn )\u2217\nto W \u03bb . The form \u0398\u0303 will be called Cartan form of the variational problem.\nIt is worth remarking here that the terminology adopted here correspond to [13],\nwhich is slightly different from the terminology of the classical theory, as exposed\nin e.g. [24]; it is fully explained in the former work how can be related the notions\ndeveloped in each case.\nReturning to our main concern, it can be proved\nthat the\u0011canonical Lepage equiv\u0010\n\u03c0\nalent is a Lepagean equivalent problem of \u039b \u2212\u2192 M, I, \u03bb . Now, the extremals of\nsome variational problem has, in general, nothing to do with the extremals of its\nLepagean equivalent problem, so it is necessary to introduce the following definition.\nDefinition 2.5 (Covariant and contravariant\nLepage equivalent\nproblems). We\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u03bb \u03c1\nsay that a Lepagean equivalent problem W \u2212\u2192 M, {0} , \u0398\u0303 for the variational\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010 \u0011\n\u03c0\nproblem \u039b \u2212\u2192 M, I, \u03bb is covariant if \u03bd \u25e6 \u03b3 \u2208 E (\u03bb) for all \u03b3 \u2208 E \u0398\u0303 ; on the\n\ncontrary, it is\u0010called\n\u0011 contravariant if every \u03c3 \u2208 E (\u03bb) is the projection of some\nextremal in E \u0398\u0303 through \u03bd. A Lepagean equivalent problem is bivariant if and\nonly if it is both covariant and contravariant.\n\nThere exists a fundamental relation between the extremals of a variational problem and the extremals of its canonical Lepage equivalent.\nTheorem 2.6. The canonical Lepage equivalent is covariant.\nFor a proof, see [13]. The contravariant nature of a Lepage equivalent problem\nis more subtle to deal with. Next we will describe another construction for the\nLepage equivalent problem, by reducing the number of additional variables that we\nput in order to get the prolongation EDS into the variational equations; although\nin this way there exist more chances to find a non contravariant Lepage equivalent\nproblem, we will see that in many cases it leads to well-behaved Lepage equivalent\nproblems.\n2.2.2. Another canonical Lepage equivalent problem. The canonical Lepage problem\nhas to deal with general EDSs; the examples we will try to manage has some nice\nfeatures that allow us to simplify this scheme. Namely, define the subbundle\n)\n(\n\u2022\n^\n(T \u2217 \u039b) : v1 yv2 y\u03b1 = 0 \u2200v1 , v2 (\u039b \u2192 M ) -vertical vectors\nZ1 (\u039b) := \u03b1 \u2208\n\nand suppose further\nthe generators of I are in Z1 (\u039b); as before, we have a\n\u0001n that\nVn \u2217\nsubbundle I alg \u2282\n(T \u039b).

The reasons for this choice will become apparent later:\nThe variational problems associated to forms in Z1 (\u039b) will have a well defined\ndescription in terms of dynamics on a (infinite dimensional) presymplectic manifold\n(cf. prop. 3.4).\nA local version of theValternate\u0001 canonical Lepage equivalent.

The important thing to note is that, if a variational problem has a covariant and contravariant Lepagean equivalent problem,\nthen the latter can be considered as a kind of Hamilton-Pontryaguin's principle for\nthe given variational problem; in fact, it is shown below that the canonical Lepagean\nequivalent problem associated to the variational problem underlying the Hamilton's\nprinciple gives rise to the classical Hamilton-Pontryaguin's principle (see example\n7). This will be our starting point for assigning a multisymplectic space to the\nvariational problem we are dealing with. The bivariance ensures us that every extremal has been taken into account in the new setting. Otherwise, namely, for non\n\n\fCONSTRAINTS, FIELD THEORY AND EDS\n\n11\n\ncontravariant canonical Lepage equivalent problems, some extremals for the original\nvariational problem could be lost in the process.\nSo let us suppose that we have the non standard problem defined by the following\ndata\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\u039b \u2192 \u039b1 \u2192 M,\nI \u2282 \u03a9\u2022 (\u039b) ,\n\uf8f4\n \u0301\n\uf8f3\n\u2217\nS [\u03c3] := M (pr\u03c3) (\u03bb) .\n\nIf I in this non standard problem has the required regularity (i.e. the \"constant\nrank\" hypothesis), then the variational\nproblem (\u039b\n\u0010\n\u0011 \u2192 M, I, \u03bb) will have a canonical Lepage equivalent problem W\u0303 \u03bb \u2192 M, {0} , \u0398\u0303 , and we can apply the scheme\ndescribed above.

The first true hamiltonian non standard\ntheory\nV which we want to deal with is electromagnetism; in this case we have that\n\u039b\u0303 := 2 (T \u2217 M ) \u2295 \u039b and \u03bb\u0303 = p\u22171 (\u2217\u03982 ) \u2227 (dp\u22173 \u03981 \u2212 p\u22172 \u03982 ) + \u03bb, being pi the projection\nin the i-th summand of \u039b\u0303 and \u03bb the pullback of the corresponding form on \u039b.\nAs before, let us suppose that we indicate by (P, F, A) \u2208 \u039b\u0303 an element of this\n(multi)phase space; then a section \u03c3 : x 7\u2192 (P (x) , F (x) , A (x)) will be a solution\nfor the eqs 2 iff\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2F = dA\nP = \u2217F\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\ndP = 0.\nThus the space of momenta coincides with the space of velocities.\nExample 10 (Poisson sigma models). The Poisson sigma model [6, 3, 4, 26] can\nbe analysed from this point of view. This is an interesting system, because its usual\ndescription (cf. the references above) is non standard, in the sense that it deals\nwith variations without a prolongation structure. Concretely, for a surface \u03a3 and a\nPoisson manifold (M, \u03c0) we have the fibration\n\u039b\u0303 :=\n\n2\n^\n\n(T \u2217 (M \u00d7 \u03a3)) \u2192 \u03a3 \u00d7 M \u2192 \u03a3.\n\nThen the open set S := Z12 (\u03a3 \u00d7 M ) \u2212 Z02 (\u03a3 \u00d7 M ) is a subbundle; let us call\n\u03bd : S \u2192 \u03a3 the restriction of the above projection.

Slicings and presymplectic structures. Given a Lepagean variational problem (that is, a non standard problem with trivial prolongation structure) and a\ndecomposition of the underlying bundle in a family of hypersurfaces (i.e., the constant time slices), the set of sections of a fixed slice can be dressed up with a\npresymplectic structure and a hamiltonian, under convenient regularity hypothesis; these data yields through Gotay-Nester algorithm to a set of constraints on\nthe sections under consideration. The procedure is explained with some extent in\nthe following paragraphs; additionally, it is settled the relationship between the extremals of the variational problem and the solutions of the Hamilton eqs associated\nto the hamiltonian and the presymplectic structure on the space of sections of the\nfixed slice. Finally, it is shown how the usual Dirac theory of constraints for a field\ntheory can be derived in this setting.\n3.1. Preliminaries. The purpose now is to set the framework allowing us to relate\nthe solutions of the Hamilton eqs on n \u2212 1-sections with regular and ordinary n \u2212 1\u03c0\nintegral elements of some associated EDS. The initial data is a bundle F \u2212\u2192 B and\na n-form \u03bb (n = dimB) on F . Then the Euler-Lagrange eqs for the action\n\u02c6\nS\u03bb [\u03c3] :=\n\u03c3\u2217 \u03bb\nB\n\ncharacterizes the sections \u03c3 : B \u2192 F which extremizes it.

In\nthis vein it is necessary to introduce the concept of slicings.\n3.2. Slicings. The first thing that we need [16] is a compatible slicing (sF , sB ) of\nthe bundle of fields: It consist of a pair of diffeomorphisms\nsF : R \u00d7 K\nsB : R \u00d7 \u03a3\n\n\u2192 F\n\u2192 B\n\nmaking commutative the diagram\nR\u00d7K\n\n\u2732 F\n\nsF\n\np2\n\np2\n\n\u2744\nR\u00d7\u03a3\n\n\u2744\n\u2732 B\n\nsB\n\nNote 1. Although not strictly necessary, we will consider that the factor \u03a3 in the\ndecomposition of the base manifold is compact. This makes sense to definitions like\n10 and 11 below, and turns the 2-form automatically closed.\nLet us define F\u03c4 := sF ({\u03c4 } \u00d7 K) and \u03a3\u03c4 := sB ({\u03c4 } \u00d7 \u03a3) for each \u03c4 \u2208 R. A\nuseful consequence of this property is that the space of sections \u0393 (F ) admits a\ntrivialization; in fact, defining for each \u03c4 \u2208 R the embedding\ni\u03c4 : \u03a3 \u2192 B : x 7\u2192 sB (\u03c4, x)\nwe have that the map\n\u22121\n\ns\u0393(F ) : R \u00d7 \u0393 (K) \u2192 \u0393 (F ) : (\u03c4, \u03c3K ) 7\u2192 sF \u25e6 \u03c3K \u25e6 (i\u03c4 )\n\n(5)\n\n\f16\n\nSANTIAGO CAPRIOTTI\n\nmakes it works (it is well-defined because of the compatibility of the slicing, meaning\nin particular that Im ( sF | \u03a3\u03c4 ) \u2282 F\u03c4 .)\n3.3.

For each \u03c4 \u2208 R we have\nthe diffeomorphism i\u03c4 : K \u2192 F\u03c4 : x 7\u2192 sF (\u03c4, x) so we can define [10, 8] the following\n\u03c4 -family of forms on K\n\u03a9\u03c4 : =\n\ni\u2217\u03c4 ( d\u03bb| F\u03c4 ) \u2208 \u03a9n+1 (K)\n\nH\u03c4 : =\n\ni\u2217\u03c4 ( \u22020 y\u03bb| F\u03c4 ) \u2208 \u03a9n\u22121 (K)\n\nwhere the symbol \u22020 is used in order to denote the canonical vector field associated\nto the \u03c4 -direction in both spaces. These forms can be used to define the following\ndata on \u0393 (K) for each \u03c4 \u2208 R: The 2-form \u03c9\u03c4 \u2208 \u03a92 (\u0393 (K)) and the function\nH\u03c4 \u2208 C \u221e (\u0393 (K)), defined through\n\u02c6\n\u0011\u0011\n\u0010 \u0010\n\u03b3 \u2217 \u03a9\u03c4 V\u03021 , V\u03022\n\u03c9\u03c4 |\u03b3 (V1 , V2 ) : =\n\u02c6\u03a3\n\u03b3 \u2217 (H\u03c4 ) .\nH\u03c4 (\u03b3) : =\n\u03a3\n\n\u2217\n\nHere \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393 (K) and V1 , V2 \u2208 \u0393 (\u03b3 (V F )) \u2261 T\u03b3 \u0393 (K); as before, V\u0302 \u2208 \u0393 (V K)\ndenotes an extension to a vector field on K for the element V \u2208 \u0393 (\u03b3 \u2217 (V K)) . With\nthis data we can define a Hamiltonian system on \u0393 (K).\n3.4. Forms on \u0393 (K) and forms on K. We want to establish a useful result\n\u03c0\nconcerning forms on a space of sections; that is, by taking on a bundle F \u2212\u2192 B an\nn + k-form \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a9n+k (F ) , k \u2208 Z, n = dimB, we can define the following k-form \u03a6\non \u0393 (F ) via\n\u02c6\n\u0010\n\u0011\n(6)\n\u03c3 \u2217 V\u03021 y * * * V\u0302k y\u03c6 .\n\u03a6|\u03c3 (V1 , * * * , Vk ) :=\nB\n\n\u03c4\u0304 n+k\n\nF\nDefinition 3.1. For each k \u2208 Z define the bundle Zkn+k (F ) \u2212\u2192\nF such that the\nfiber on e \u2208 F is given by\n)\n(\nn+k\n^\nn+k\n\u2217\n(Te F ) : V1 y * * * Vk+1 y\u03b1 = 0 \u2200V1 , * * * , Vk+1 \u2208 Ve F .\nZk (F ) e := \u03b1 \u2208\n\nThis set can be called the space of k-semibasic n + k-forms. We will say that a\n\u2022\nnonzero form \u03b1 belongs to Zk\u2022 properly iff \u03b1 \u2208 Zk\u2022 but \u03b1 \u2208\n/ Zk\u22121\n(F ).\nThen we can prove the next result.\n\u0001\nProposition 3. Let us suppose that \u03c6 \u2208 \u0393 Zkn+l (F ) properly (l \u2264 k), and let \u03a6\nbe as in Eq. 6. Then \u03a6 = 0 iff \u03c6 = 0.\n\nNote 2. The previous proposition can be\n\u0001 rephrased as follows: The map \u03c6 7\u2192 \u03a6 is\ninjective when restricted to \u0393 Zkn+l (F ) .\n\nProof. It is clear that\n\u03c6 = 0 implies\n\u03a6 = 0. For the converse implication, \u03a6 = 0\n\u0011\n \u0301 \u2217\u0010\nimplies that B \u03c3 V\u03021 y * * * V\u0302l y\u03c6 = 0 for all \u03c3 \u2208 \u0393 (F ) and V1 , * * * , Vl vertical\n\nvectors defined on Im \u03c3; therefore V\u03021 y * * * V\u0302l y\u03c6 = 0 for all collection of l vertical\nvectors, and it means that \u03c6 \u2208 Zl\u22121 (F ). Therefore \u03c6 = 0.\n\n\fCONSTRAINTS, FIELD THEORY AND EDS\n\n17\n\nFor each \u03c4 \u2208 R we can define the following EDS on K\nI\u03c4 : =\n\ni\u2217\u03c4 ( I| F\u03c4 ) ,\n\n(7)\n\na fundamental object in the subsequent sections, because it is closely related to the\nDirac constraints of the theory.\nFinally we state a very important result, because it relates the solutions (if any) of\nthe presymplectic dynamical system with the extremals of the underlying variational\nproblem.\nProposition 4. Let \u03bb be a n-form on F such that \u03bb \u2208 Z1n (F ) properly. Then for\neach \u03c4 \u2208 R, a pair (\u03c3\u03c4 , X\u03c4 ) \u2208 T\u03c3\u03c4 \u0393 (K) satisfies the Hamilton equations for sections\n(X\u03c4 y\u03c9\u03c4 )|\u03c3\u03c4 = dH\u03c4 |\u03c3\u03c4\n\n(8)\n\niff it satifies the following equation\n\u03c3\u03c4\u2217 (V y (X\u03c4 y\u03a9\u03c4 \u2212 dH\u03c4 )) = 0,\n\n\u2200V \u2208 \u0393 (\u03c3\u03c4\u2217 (V K)) .\n\n(9)\n\nProof. The key is to realize that the n-form X\u03c4 y\u03a9\u03c4 \u2212 dH\u03c4 belongs to Z2n (F ) . On\nthe other side it was shown in proposition\n3 that there are no non zero n-forms \u03b2\n \u0301\nin Z2n (F ) such that the map V 7\u2192 \u03a3 \u03c3 \u2217 (V y\u03b2) is zero.\nThe meaning of this proposition must be clarified: It says that the pair (\u03c3\u03c4 , X\u03c4 )\nis a solution of the Hamilton equations on \u0393 (K) defined by \u03c9\u03c4 and H\u03c4 if and only if\nV\u03c4 := \u22020 + X\u03c4 belongs to the polar space of the n \u2212 1-integral element \u03c3\u03c4 \u2217 (T \u03a3) for\nthe Hamilton-Cartan EDS in this context, Eq. 4. Then if there exists a regular flag\nfor this EDS with last terms 0 \u2282 * * * \u2282 \u03c3\u03c4 \u2217 (T \u03a3) \u2282 h\u03c3\u03c4 \u2217 (T \u03a3) , V\u03c4 i, the n-integral\nmanifold passing through it will generate solutions for the Hamilton equations, and\nconversely. The following sections will use this remarkable relation.\n3.5. Presymplectic structures on a multimomentum space. Let us now apply the setting of the previous section to our multisymplectic space. In particular,\nlet us suppose that there exists a compatible slicing of the bundle \u039b\u0303 \u2192 M : So besides of the spacetime decomposition M = R\u00d7\u03a3 (as above, it will be assumed that \u03a3\nis a compact manifold), we have a decomposition \u039b\u0303 = R \u00d7 L\u0303 such that \u039b\u0303\u03c4 = {\u03c4 } \u00d7 L\u0303\nfor every \u03c4 \u2208 R; thus p : L\u0303 \u2192 \u03a3 is a fibration that makes commutative the following\ndiagram\nR \u00d7 L\u0303 \u2243 \u039b\u0303\n\n\u2732 R\u00d7\u03a3\u2243 M\n\nid\u00d7p\n\np2\n\np2\n\n\u2744\nL\u0303\n\np\n\n\u2744\n\u2732 \u03a3\n\nIn such a case (cf. the \u0010\nprevious\nsection) we can define a presymplectic structure on\n\u0011\nthe space of sections \u0393 L\u0303 together with a function on it such that the solutions of\nthe classical mechanics system defined by these data induce solutions for the EDS\ngenerated by 3. That is, if we define\ni\u03c4 : L\u0303 \u2192 \u039b\u0303\u03c4 : l 7\u2192 (\u03c4, l)\n\n\f18\n\nSANTIAGO CAPRIOTTI\n\nwe can use these structures to define the forms\ni\nh\u0010\n\u0011\n(10)\nH\u03c4 : = i\u2217\u03c4 \u22020 y\u03bb\u0303 |\u039b\u0303\u03c4\ni\nh\u0010 \u0011\n(11)\n\u03a9\u03c4 : = i\u2217\u03c4 d\u03bb\u0303 |\u039b\u0303\u03c4 ;\n\u0010 \u0010 \u0011\u0011\n\u0010 \u0010 \u0011\u0011\nso, we have H\u03c4 \u2208 C \u221e \u0393 L\u0303\nand \u03c9\u03c4 \u2208 \u03a92 \u0393 L\u0303\n(which preserves a \u03c4 dependence) defined by\n\u02c6\n\u03c3 \u2217 (H\u03c4 ) ,\n(12)\nH\u03c4 (\u03c3) : =\n\u03a3\n\u02c6\n\u0011\u0011\n\u0010 \u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n(13)\n\u03c3 \u2217 \u03a9\u03c4 X\u0303\u03c4 , \u1ef8\u03c4 ,\n\u03c9\u03c4 |\u03c3 X\u0303\u03c4 , \u1ef8\u03c4 : =\n\u03a3\n\n\u0010 \u0011\nfor every pair X\u0303\u03c4 , \u1ef8\u03c4 of vertical vector fields that cover \u03c3, i.e., elements of T\u03c3 \u0393 L\u0303 .\n\nIn this setting the proposition 4 is true, and we have to our disposal (under adequate\nregularity conditions, i.e., if the foliation induced by the slicing is regular in the sense\nof definition 4.3 below) the identification between the dynamical equations on the\nspace of sections and the Hamilton-Cartan EDS.\nNow it will be necessary to introduce further simplifications; in particular, we take\nL\u22020 \u03bb\u0303 = 0. Using the slicing introduced on \u039b\u0303 and the Hamilton-Cartan EDS, given\nby 3, we can define a parameterized EDS I\u03c4 according to the Eq. 7. Under this\nsimplification it is true the following result.\nLemma 3.2. If L\u22020 \u03bb\u0303 = 0, then H\u03c4 = H\u03c4 \u2032 =: H and \u03c9\u03c4 = \u03c9\u03c4 \u2032 =: \u03c9 for all \u03c4, \u03c4 \u2032 \u2208 R.\nMoreover, the EDS I\u03c4 does not depends on \u03c4 .\nIn particular, this lemma allow us to choose a slice to work with.\nFinally we want to show how the usual theory of constraints in a field theory can be\nobtained from this scheme. In the following example we set up the relation between\nthe presymplectic structures defined above and the symplectic structures defined in\nthe usual approach to (first order) field theories.\nExample 11 (First order field theories - Cont).

Constraints and EDS. The aim in this section is to prove the main result of\nthe article: The fact that, under certain regularity hypothesis (cf. definition 4.3\nbelow), it is possible to describe the set of constraints arising from the application\nof the Gotay-Nester algorithm on the dynamical data 12, 13 as a set of generators of\nthe EDS induced on the chosen slice by the (prolongation of the) Hamilton-Cartan\nEDS.\n4.1. Useful characterization for constraints. As we said above, we want to\nrelate the Dirac constraints arising from a field theory (in the non standard setting)\nwith a EDS associated to its eqs of motion. In order to achieve this, it is necessary to\nadopt a meaningful picture for these constraints. So we use the following description\nfor the constraints obtained through the Gotay-Nester algorithm [16].\nDefinition 4.1. Given a presymplectic manifold (N, \u03c9) with a hamiltonian H \u2208\nC \u221e (N ), the constraint submanifold C \u2282 N is the maximal submanifold of N\naccording to property\n\u0001\n(14)\ndH T C \u22a5 = 0\nwhere T C \u22a5 denotes the (perhaps singular) subbundle of T N composed by the\nsymplectic complements of the fibres of the subbundle T C. A submanifold in M\nsatisfying property 14 is said to be invariant respect to the dynamics defined by\n(\u03c9, H).\n\n\fCONSTRAINTS, FIELD THEORY AND EDS\n\n21\n\n\u0010 \u0011\nBecause we need to know the tangent spaces for submanifolds \u0393 (K) \u2282 \u0393 L\u0303\ncomposed of integral sections for some EDS K, we prove the next lemma.\n\u0010 \u0011\nLemma 4.2. If the set \u0393 (K) , with K \u2282 \u03a9\u2022 L\u0303 an EDS, is a true submanifold in\n\u0010 \u0011\n\u0393 L\u0303 , then its tangent space in \u03c3 \u2208 \u0393 (K) is the vector space\no\nn\n\u0010 \u0010 \u0011\u0011\n\u0001\nT\u03c3 \u0393 (K) = X \u2208 \u0393 \u03c3 \u2217 V L\u0303 : \u03c3 \u2217 LX\u0302 K = 0 ,\n\u0010 \u0011\n\u0010 \u0010 \u0011\u0011\nwhere the hat denotes some extension to X L\u0303 of an element of \u0393 \u03c3 \u2217 V L\u0303 .\nProof. Under our hypothesis, we just need to derive along a curve to obtain the\nlemma.\n\n4.2. Admissible sections and involution. We start with a (non standard) variational problem on a bundle \u039b \u2192 M , where dimM = n; by assuming that there\nexists a (bivariant) Lepage-equivalent problem, we pass to a non restricted variational problem\n\u0010 on\n\u0011 a new bundle \u039b\u0303 \u2192 M . The variational equations defines here an\nEDS I \u2282 \u03a9\u2022 \u039b\u0303 ; the integral sections for this EDS are the classical solutions to\nour field theory. So we have the EDS\n\u0001\nI, \u03a9 := dx1 \u2227 * * * \u2227 dxn\ngenerated by the Hamilton-Cartan equations, i.e.\nD\n\u0010 \u0011E\nI := V yd\u03bb\u0303 : V \u2208 \u0393 V \u039b\u0303\n\ndiff\n\n,\n\n(15)\n\nand by using the Cartan-Kuranishi theorem \u0010we \u0011found a bundle \u039b\u0303\u2032 \u2192 M , a submersion \u03a0 : \u039b\u0303\u2032 \u2192 \u039b\u0303 and an EDS (I \u2032 , \u03a9\u2032 ) \u2282 \u03a9\u2022 \u039b\u0303\u2032 which is n-involutive and verifies\nthat\n\u03a0\u2217 (Vn (I \u2032 , \u03a9\u2032 )) = Vn (I, \u03a9) .\nRemark 1. It is important to pointing out the following facts.\n\u2022 The original EDS does not work if there exists n \u2212 1-integral manifolds on\neach \u03c4 -slice whose possible thickening directions rests in the same slice. The\nway to avoid this annoying fact is to select in Vn (I) only those integral elements satisfying the independence condition; this subset of sections can be\ndescribed as n-integral submanifolds for an involutive EDS I \u2032 , obtained from\nI by performing enough prolongations.\n\u2022 It is assumed that there are no 0-forms to take care of in I and I \u2032 ; if it occurs,\none must to include them into the bundles \u039b\u0303 and \u039b\u0303\u2032 , that is, redefine these\nsets by taking into account that the new 0-forms annihilates on them. The\ncorresponding EDSs are the pullback of the original ones.\n\u2022 We know that \u039b\u0303 \u2192 M admits a compatible slicing; we will suppose further\nthat the same is true for \u039b\u0303\u2032 \u2192 M with \u039b\u0303\u2032 \u2243 R \u00d7 L\u0303\u2032 . This diffeomorphism will\nbe denoted as s\u039b\u0303\u2032 . Moreover, it will be assumed the existence of a submersion\n\u03a00 : L\u0303\u2032 \u2192 L\u0303 such that the following diagram is commutative\n\u039b\u0303\u2032\np2\n\n\u2744\nL\u0303\u2032\n\n\u03a0\u2732\n\n\u039b\u0303\np2\n\n\u2744\n\u2732 L\u0303\n\u03a00\n\n\f22\n\nSANTIAGO CAPRIOTTI\n\n\u2022 For each \u03c4 \u2208 R it is tempting to define the EDS\n\u0010 \u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\nI\u03c4\u2032 := i\u2217\u03c4 I \u2032 | \u039b\u0303\u2032\u03c4 \u2282 \u03a9\u2022 L\u0303\u2032\n\u0011\n\u0010\nwhere \u039b\u0303\u2032\u03c4 := i\u03c4 {\u03c4 } \u00d7 L\u0303\u2032 and\ni\u03c4 : L\u0303\u2032 \u0592\u2192 \u039b\u0303\u2032 : l 7\u2192 s\u039b\u0303\u2032 (\u03c4, l) ,\n\nclaiming that\n\u0393n\u22121 (I\u03c4\u2032 , \u03c9 \u2032 ) = i\u2217\u03c4 (\u0393n (I \u2032 , \u03a9\u2032 ))\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u0393n\u22121 (I\u03c4\u2032 , \u03c9 \u2032 )\n\n(16)\ni\u2217\u03c4\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nwhere \u03c9 := \u22020 y\u03a9 . It is obvious that\n\u2283 (\u0393n (I , \u03a9 )). The\nn-involutivity of I \u2032 ensures that every n-integral element is tangent to some\nsolution; however, the opposite inclusion \u0393n\u22121 (I\u03c4\u2032 , \u03c9 \u2032 ) \u2282 i\u2217\u03c4 (\u0393n (I \u2032 , \u03a9\u2032 )) is\nachieved if every n\u22121-integral element of I\u03c4\u2032 can be thickened out (in a regular\nfashion) to a n-integral element for I \u2032 . The requeriment of involutivity is not\nenough; instead, we need the regularity of every n \u2212 1-integral element of I\u03c4\u2032 .\nNote 3 (System where 16 is not verified). There exists an almost canonical counterexample to this claim: The EDS describing orthogonal coordinates in three dimensions. See example 3.2 and theorem 3.3 in [5].\nDue to the previous discussion, we need to introduce a new definition.\nDefinition 4.3. Let I be an involutive EDS on M and let us suppose that M \u2243\nR \u00d7 N for some manifold N ; as above, for each \u03c4 \u2208 R let us define the following\nEDS on N\nI\u03c4 := i\u2217\u03c4 ( I| {\u03c4 } \u00d7 N ) .\nWe say that the induced foliation is regular with respect to the EDS I if every n \u2212 1integral element of I\u03c4 , \u03c4 \u2208 R, is regular. A slicing inducing a regular folitation will\nbe called regular.\nThe regularity notion for a foliation ensures that one can extend any n\u22121-integral\nmanifold for the EDS contained in a leaf to a n-integral manifold; for suitable\nindependence conditions the required involutivity ensures that the extension is not\nincluded in that leaf. So we can state the following result.\n\u223c\n\nProposition 5. If I is an involutive EDS on P , and sP : P \u2212\u2192 Q \u00d7 R is a regular\nslicing for I, then\n\u0393n\u22121 (I\u03c4 , \u03c9) = i\u2217\u03c4 (\u0393n (I, \u03a9)) ,\nwhere \u03c9 := \u22020 y\u03a9 and \u22020 is the vector field pointing in the R-direction of the slicing.\nProof. The hard inclusion is\n\u0393n\u22121 (I\u03c4 , \u03c9) \u2282 i\u2217\u03c4 (\u0393n (I, \u03a9)) .\nBecause of the regularity, it follows from the Cartan-K\u00e4hler theorem that any n \u2212 1integral section for I\u03c4 can be extended to a n-integral section for I.\nIt remains to show some revelant properties of the solutions of an EDS. In order\nto do that, it is important to establish the following fact.\nLemma 4.4. Let I be an EDS on the manifold M , N \u2282 M an integral submanifold\nand X \u2208 \u0393 (TN M ) such that\n(Xy\u03b1)| N = 0\n\n\fCONSTRAINTS, FIELD THEORY AND EDS\n\n23\n\nfor all \u03b1 \u2208 I.

If i : N \u0592\u2192 M is the canonical injection, we have that\n\u0010\n\u0011\ni\u2217 X\u0302y\u03b1 = i\u2217 (Xy\u03b1) ,\nso\n\n\u0001\nLX\u0302 \u03b1 N\n\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0011\u0011\n= i\u2217 X\u0302yd\u03b1 + d X\u0302y\u03b1\n\n= i\u2217 (Xyd\u03b1) + di\u2217 (Xy\u03b1)\n= 0\n\nfor all \u03b1 \u2208 I.\nBy using the definition 7 we obtain an EDS (I\u03c4\u2032 , \u03c9 \u2032 := \u22020 y\u03a9\u2032 ) on L\u0303\u2032 . As we will\nsee in the next sections, this exterior system gives another description for the Dirac\nconstraints, namely, as (algebraic) generators of an EDS.\n4.3. The constraint submanifold as an space of sections.\n4.3.1. An outline. Here we describe the essential elements involved in proving that\nthe constraint submanifold coincides with the set of maps \u03a00 \u25e6\u0393n\u22121 (I\u03c4\u2032 , \u03c9 \u2032 ). Because\nthis proof uses the characterization of C as the maximal invariant submanifold of\nthe set of section of the bundle L\u0303, it is necessary to prove that\n1. \u03a00 \u25e6 \u0393n\u22121 (I\u03c4\u2032 , \u03c9 \u2032 ) is invariant, and\n2. C \u2282 \u03a00 \u25e6 \u0393n\u22121 (I\u03c4\u2032 , \u03c9 \u2032 ).\nIt seems that the first condition is consequence of the fact that the original PDEs\n9 are satisfied by the elements of this set. The second condition can be verified by\nbuilding a n-section from a n \u2212 1-section in C via the formula\n\u03c3 : (\u03c4, x) 7\u2192 (\u03c4, \u03c3\u03c4 (x))\nrealizing that it is an integral section for (I \u2032 , \u03a9\u2032 ), and then restricting to a \u03c4\u0010-slice.\n\u0011\nIt was previously stated that a submanifold Q \u2282 P in our phase space \u0393 L\u0303 is\ninvariant iff\n\u0001\ndH T Q\u22a5 = 0.\n\nAccording to a result of Marsden et al [16], the invariance property is equivalent to\nthe existence of tangent solutions to the Hamilton eqs restricted to Q; that is, for\nevery q \u2208 Q the system\n(XH y\u03c9)|q = dH|q\n\nhas a solution XH |q belonging to Tq Q. In the first part of the proof the construction\nis performed in order to ensure that the submanifold defined by the EDS admits\ntangent solutions to the Hamilton eqs, implying the invariance. In the second part\nthe strategy is to prove that our submanifold is maximal with respect to the property\nof invariance; now the characterization of invariance is used in the opposite direction,\nthat is, it is initially supposed that certain submanifold is invariant, and by using the\ncharacterization, arriving to the conclusion that the Hamilton eqs. admits tangent\nsolutions to this submanifold. Finally it can be related to the manifold defined by\nthe EDS because of the interpretation of the Hamilton eqs as generators of the EDS.\nAfter this warm-up, we are then ready to formulate the theorem with its proof.\n\n\f24\n\nSANTIAGO CAPRIOTTI\n\n4.3.2. The main theorem and its proof. There are several elements to be included\nin the final proof of the main theorem of the paper. In the previous paragraphs\nit was argued the necessity of having a submersion \u03a0 : \u039b\u0303\u2032 \u2192 \u039b\u0303 between bundles\nfitting in the diagram\n\u03a0\n\u2732 \u039b\u0303\n\u039b\u0303\u2032\n\u2745\n\u2758\n\u2745\n\n\u2720\nM\n\nNext it is assumed that there exists a compatible (with respect to the both bundle\nstructures) slicing of M which is well-behaved with the maps in this diagram. That\nis, there exists a map \u03a00 : L\u0303\u2032 \u2192 L\u0303 making commutative the following\n\u039b\u0303\u2032\n\n\u2732 L\u0303\u2032 \u00d7 R\n\ns\u039b\u0303\u2032\n\n\u03a00 \u00d7id\n\n\u03a0\n\n\u2744\n\u039b\u0303\n\n\u2744\n\u2732 L\u0303 \u00d7 R\ns\u039b\u0303\n\n\u2744\nM\n\nsM\n\n\u2744\n\u2732 \u03a3\u00d7R\n\nThe slicing on \u039b\u0303\u2032 allows us to define the EDS\n\u0010\n\u0011\nI\u03c4\u2032 := i\u2217\u03c4 I| L\u0303\u2032 \u00d7 {\u03c4 } ,\n\nwhich is nothing but the original involutive EDS I \u2032 restricted to the leaf L\u0303\u2032 \u00d7 {\u03c4 }.\nr\nIn order to ensures that Vn\u22121 (I\u03c4\u2032 ) \u2282 Vn\u22121\n(I \u2032 ), it is required furthermore that the\nslicing be regular with respect to the EDS I \u2032 . Now we define\n\u0393 (I\u03c4\u2032 ) := \u03a00 \u25e6 \u0393n\u22121 (I\u03c4\u2032 , \u03c9 \u2032 ) ,\nand the main theorem can be stated as follows.\nTheorem 4.5. Let us suppose that the EDS I defined through 15 is \u03c4 -invariant,\nnamely\nL\u22020 I \u2282 I.\nThen the constraint submanifold C in the presymplectic space of sections is equal to\n\u0393 (I\u03c4\u2032 ).\nProof. The constraint submanifold C can be characterized as the maximal\n\u0010 invariant\n\u0011\nsubmanifold of the set of sections of L\u0303 [16], where invariance for J \u2282 \u0393 L\u0303 means\nthat\n\u0001\ndH T J \u22a5 = 0,\nbeing H the Hamiltonian function for our system and the orthogonal complement\nis taken with respect to the presymplectic structure in the space of sections. It\ncan be proved (prop. 6.9 in [16]) that the invariance of a submanifold J in a\npresymplectic manifold is equivalent to the fact that through any point of J there\nexists solutions to the Hamilton equations tangent to this submanifold.

It remains to show that this solution is tangent to \u0393 (I\u03c4\u2032 ); according to lemma\n4.2, it is equivalent to show that\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u03c3\u03c4\u2217 LX\u0302\u03c4 I\u03c4 = 0\n\u0010 \u0011\nfor some extension X\u0302\u03c4 \u2208 X L\u0303 of X\u03c4 . Because of lemma 4.4 and taking into\naccount that \u03c3\u03c4 is a n \u2212 1-dimensional integral submanifold of I, we conclude that\n\u0001\n\u03c3\u03c4\u2217 LX\u0302 I = 0,\n(19)\n\u0010 \u0011\n\u0010 \u0011\nwhere X\u0302 := \u22020 + i\u03c4 X\u0302\u03c4 , and X\u0302\u03c4 \u2208 X L\u0303 is some extension to X\u03c4 .

Therefore we have shown that \u0393 (I\u03c4\u2032 ) is an\n\u0010 \u0011\ninvariant submanifold of \u0393 L\u0303 .\n\n\u2032\nOur next task is to show that\n\u0010 \u0011\u0393 (I\u03c4 ) is maximal among\u0010all\u0011 the invariant submanifolds\nof the space of sections \u0393 L\u0303 .

This section is\nn-integral for I because of the Hamilton equations. In fact, both conditions above\nimplies that \u03c3\u03c4 \u2217 (Tx \u03a3) \u2295 h \u22020 |\u03c4 i (\u03c4 belonging to some neighborhood of 0) annihilates\nthe set of forms\nn\n\u0010 \u0011o\nS := V yd\u03bb\u0303 : V \u2208 \u0393 V \u039b\u0303 ;\n\nbecause S \u2282 I, we have that hSidiff = I (by the definition of I, see Hamilton-Cartan\nEDS, equation 3) and thus Vn (hSidiff ) = Vn (I). Then by using the prolongation\nproperties we can find an integral section \u03c3 \u2032 which is n-integral for I \u2032 and \u03a0\u25e6\u03c3 \u2032 = \u03c3;\nmoreover,\n\u0011\n\u0010\ni0 \u25e6 \u03c30 = \u03a00 \u25e6 \u03c3 \u2032 | \u039b\u0303\u20320\nand \u03c3| \u039b\u0303\u20320 \u2208 \u0393n\u22121 (I0\u2032 ), and then \u03c30 \u2208 \u03a00 \u25e6 \u0393n\u22121 (I0\u2032 ) = \u0393 (I0\u2032 ).\n\nIn the following section we will use the relation settled by this theorem between\nDirac constraints and the EDS I\u03c4 in some interesting examples.\n5. Examples. This section contains examples where the techniques developed in\nthe work will be applied. The first two of them deals with variational problems related to field theories; the last two shows some applications with more mathematical\ntaste.\n\u0010 \u0011\nof language: The symbol i\u03c4 \u2217 X\u0302\u03c4 in the following equation represents the vector field\n\u0011\n\u0010\n(l, s) 7\u2192 is\u2217 X\u0302s (m) on \u039b\u0303 \u2243 L\u0303 \u00d7 R, where the number \u03c4 refers to the second factor in this\n2 Abuse\n\ndecomposition.\n3 We hide behind this assumption some issues concerning hard analysis.\n\n\fCONSTRAINTS, FIELD THEORY AND EDS\n\n27\n\n5.1. Techniques in the EDS treatment. Before to start with, it is necessary to\nmention some specific issues related to the verification of involutivity for a system\nwith independence condition. Namely, it consists of two parts:\n1. The verification that the reduced characters are equal to the original characters.\n2. The verification of the equality hypothesis of the second part of the Cartan's\ntest.\nIf any of these fails, we use some of the tools discussed in the appendix B in order to\nfind an EDS with the same integral manifolds (in some dimension) which make them\nhold. In order to work with these conditions, let us suppose that E = hv1 , * * * , vn i \u2282\nTx X is an n-integral element of an EDS (I, \u03c91 \u2227 * * * \u2227 \u03c9n ) on a manifold X and we\ntake the flag induced by the subspaces\nE0 : =\n\n0,\n\nEk : =\n\nhv1 , * * * , vk i ,\n\nk = 1, * * * , n \u2212 1;\n\nfor each k, the linear system 23 gives us the space H (Ek ) as the kernel of a linear\noperator M (v1 , * * * , vk ) : Tx X \u2192 Tx\u2217 X. Then we have that the Cartan characters4\nare\nck = rank M (v1 , * * * , vk ) .\nFor the calculation of the reduced Cartan characters, we must write the operators\nM (v1 , * * * , vk ) in terms of a basis {\u03c91 , * * * , \u03c9n , * * * } \u2282 T \u2217 X and its dual: The\nreduced Cartan characters c\u0303k are the ranks of the matrices obtained through this\nprocedure, after deleting the columns corresponding to the elements \u03c91 , * * * , \u03c9n of\nthe chosen basis.\n5.2. Electromagnetism. We apply our results in the case of the classical theory\nof electromagnetic field; as we know, the EDS associated to their Hamilton-Cartan\nV2 \u2217\nV2\nequations is defined on \u039b\u0303 =\n(T M )\u2295 (T \u2217 M )\u2295T \u2217M with coordinates (P, F, A)\nby\nI := hF \u2212 dA, P \u2212 \u2217F, dP, dF, dP \u2212 d (\u2217F )ialg\n\u2217\n\nwith the independence condition \u03a9 := (p3 \u25e6 \u03c4\u0304M ) (\u03c9M ) 6= 0, where \u03c9M \u2208 \u03a94 (M )\nis some volume form defined on the space-time (by supposing M orientable). For\nthis system the reduced characters c\u03032 and c\u03033 are less than the corresponding Cartan\ncharacters; this is because of the appeareance of the form P \u2212 \u2217F in the system,\nwhich reduces to a collection of functions on \u039b\u0303 when it is evaluated on integral\nelements satisfying the independence condition. In order to circumvect this, we will\nV2 \u2217\ndeal with the associated EDS on \u039b :=\n(T M ) \u2295 T \u2217 M defined through\nJ := hF \u2212 dA, d (\u2217F ) , dF ialg ;\n\nit is the EDS induced by pullback of our original one to the submanifold described by\nthe equation P = \u2217F . Anyway, by using the identification of the vertical directions\nwith the fibres in our bundle, we use the following vectors\nV \u03bc := (\u2202\u03bc ; F \u03bc , A\u03bc )\nas the basis inducing the flag\nE0 := {0} \u2282 E1 := V 1 \u2282 E2 := V 1 , V 2 \u2282 E3 := V 1 , V 2 , V 3 \u2282 E\n4 These are not the true Cartan characters as they are defined in the literature, although they\nare closely related.\n\n\f28\n\nSANTIAGO CAPRIOTTI\n\nin E := V 0 , * * * , V 3 \u2282 T(F,A) \u039b whose Cartan characters are being calculated.\nConcretely\n\u2022 Because J (1) := J \u2229 \u03a91 (\u039b) = {0} we obtain that\no\nn\nH (E0 ) =\nv \u2208 T(F,A) \u039b : vy\u03c6 = 0 for all \u03c6 \u2208 J (1)\n= T(F,A) \u039b\n\nand so c0 = codim H (E0 ) = 0.\n\u2022 In this case\no\nn\nH (E1 ) = v \u2208 T(F,A) \u039b : vy (wy\u03c6) = 0 for all \u03c6 \u2208 J (2) and w \u2208 E1 ,\nso v \u2208 H (E1 ) if and only if\n\n\u0001\nvy \u22021 yF \u2212 A1 \u2212 \u22021 ydA = 0;\n\u0001\nthen c1 = rank M V 1 = 1.\n\u2022 Now\nn\nH (E2 ) =\nv \u2208 T(F,A) \u039b : vy (w1 y\u03c6) = 0 and vy (w2 yw3 y\u03c8) = 0\n\nfor all \u03c6 \u2208 J (2) , \u03c8 \u2208 J (3) and w1 , w2 , w3 \u2208 E2\n\nand then v \u2208 H (E2 ) iff it is solution for the system\n\u0001\nvy \u22021 yF \u2212 A1 \u2212 \u22021 ydA\n\u0001\nvy \u22022 yF \u2212 A2 \u2212 \u22022 ydA\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\nvy \u22021 y \u2217F 2 \u2212 \u22022 y \u2217F 1 + \u22021 y\u22022 yd (\u2217F )\n\u0001\nvy \u22021 yF 2 \u2212 \u22022 yF 1 + \u22021 y\u22022 ydF\n\nthis means that c2 = 4.\n\u2022 Accordingly, the equations determining H (E3 ) will be\n\u0001\nvy \u22021 yF \u2212 A1 \u2212 \u22021 ydA\n\u0001\nvy \u22022 yF \u2212 A2 \u2212 \u22022 ydA\n\u0001\nvy \u22023 yF \u2212 A3 \u2212 \u22023 ydA\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\nvy \u22021 y \u2217F 2 \u2212 \u22022 y \u2217F 1 + \u22021 y\u22022 yd (\u2217F )\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\nvy \u22021 y \u2217F 3 \u2212 \u22023 y \u2217F 1 + \u22021 y\u22023 yd (\u2217F )\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\nvy \u22022 y \u2217F 3 \u2212 \u22023 y \u2217F 2 + \u22022 y\u22023 yd (\u2217F )\n\u0001\nvy \u22021 yF 2 \u2212 \u22022 yF 1 + \u22021 y\u22022 ydF\n\u0001\nvy \u22021 yF 3 \u2212 \u22023 yF 1 + \u22021 y\u22023 ydF\n\u0001\nvy \u22022 yF 3 \u2212 \u22023 yF 2 + \u22022 y\u22023 ydF\nthe associated Cartan character being\n\nc3 = 9\nbecause of the Hodge operator.\n\n=\n\n0\n\n=\n\n0\n\n=\n\n0\n\n=\n\n0;\n\n=\n\n0\n\n=\n\n0\n\n=\n\n0\n\n=\n\n0\n\n=\n\n0\n\n=\n\n0\n\n=\n\n0\n\n=\n\n0\n\n=\n\n0;\n\no\n\n\fCONSTRAINTS, FIELD THEORY AND EDS\n\n29\n\nLet us now calculate the codimension of V4 (J ) \u2282 G4 (T \u039b); as before, it will be the\nrank of the linear operator behind the linear system5\nV \u03bc yV \u03bd y (F \u2212 dA) = 0\nV \u03bc yV \u03bd yV \u03c3 y (d (\u2217F )) = 0\nV \u03bc yV \u03bd yV \u03c3 y (dF ) = 0\n\n\u2200\u03bc, \u03bd, \u03c3 = 0, * * * , 3.\n\nUsing the symmetries of the contraction operator, we see that the a priori independent equations in this set are determined by the set of pairs of indices\n(0, 1) , (0, 2) , (0, 3) , (1, 2) , (1, 3) , (2, 3)\nand the set of triples\n(0, 1, 2) , (0, 1, 3) , (0, 2, 3) , (1, 2, 3) .\nThe linear operator is constant, consequently it has maximal rank everywhere; so\nwe have that codimE V4 (J ) = # equations = 14.

Gotay-Nester algorithm. Before starting with the next examples, it is necessary to summarize the Gotay-Nester algorithm. The initial data is a triple\n(M0 , \u03c90 , H0 ) where (M0 , \u03c90 ) is a presymplectic manifold and H0 \u2208 C \u221e (M0 ). Then\nthe algorithm proceed with the following steps:\n1. Calculate K0 := ker \u03c90 .\n2. For each l \u2208 N, let Cl+1 be the ideal in C \u221e (Ml ) generated by Cl+1 :=\n{X * Hl : X \u2208 Kl }.\n3. Define Ml+1 as the zero locus for functions in Cl+1 .

According to our previous discusion,\nwe have that the Hamilton-Cartan EDS I is locally generated by\n(\n\u03b8\u03bc := dx\u03bc \u2212 \u03c0 \u03bc\u03bd \u03b7\u03b1\u03bd d\u03be \u03b1 ,\n\u0393\u03c3 := d\u03b7\u03b1\u03c3 \u2227 d\u03be \u03b1 \u2212 12 (\u2202\u03c3 \u03c0 \u03bc\u03bd ) \u03b7\u03b1\u03bc \u03b7\u03b2\u03bd d\u03be \u03b2 \u2227 d\u03be \u03b1 .\nIt can be shown (see for example [26]) that if J (\u03c0) is the jacobiator of the bivector\n\u03c0, then\n\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\n\nd\u03b8\u03bc \u2261 [J (\u03c0)]\n\n\u03b7\u03b1\u03bd \u03b7\u03b2\u03c1 d\u03be \u03b1 \u2227 d\u03be \u03b2\n\nmod I.\n\nSo the jacobiator in these systems is related to the torsion of the associated EDS.\nBecause we will study the Cartan characters of a 2-dimensional integral element, it\nis not necessary to find an expression for d\u0393\u03bc .\nLet us consider the flag E0 = 0 \u2282 E1 := hv1 i \u2282 E := hv1 , v0 i, where\nvi := \u2202\u03bei + Xi\u03bc \u2202x\u03bc + \u039ei\u03b1\u03bd \u2202\u03b7\u03b1\u03bd \u2208 T(\u03be,x,\u03b7) S, i = 0, 1.\nThen E will belong to V2 (I) iff\n\uf8f1 \u03c1\n\u03c1\u03bd\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2X0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u03b70\u03bd = 0,\n\u03c1\nX1 \u2212 \u03c0 \u03c1\u03bd \u03b71\u03bd = 0,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 0\n\u039e1\u03c3 \u2212 \u039e10\u03c3 \u2212 (\u2202\u03c3 \u03c0 \u03bc\u03bd ) \u03b70\u03bc \u03b71\u03bd = 0\n\nfor \u03c1, \u03c3 = 1, * * * , dimM ; then codimE V2 (I) = 3n.

Then the\nCartan test is satisfied, and the system is involutive at E.\n\n5.4.2. Investigation through the Gotay-Nester algorithm. It is interesting to see how\nthe Jacobi identity for \u03c0 can be obtained from the Gotay-Nester algorithm associated to the non standard variational problem describing a Poisson sigma model.

Because \u03c0 is a\nPoisson structure, these constraints are identically satisfied, and M1 is an invariant\nmanifold.\n5.5. Dirac method and integrability conditions. From [29] we know that the\nfollowing PDE system\n(\n\u03c6zz + y\u03c6xx = 0\n\u03c6yy = 0\nhas the equations \u03c6xxy = \u03c6xxxx = 0 as integrability conditions. This system can be\nwritten as the EDS I generated by\nn\n\u03b8 := d\u03c6 \u2212 pdx \u2212 qdy \u2212 rdz,\no\n\u03931 := dr \u2227 dx \u2227 dy + ydp \u2227 dy \u2227 dz, \u03932 := dq \u2227 dx \u2227 dz\n\non R7 with coordinates (x, y, z, \u03c6, p, q, r). It is noted also that these integrability\nconditions can be obtained applying the prolongation procedure twice. In the following sections we will use the correspondence settled by Theorem 4.5 in order to\ncalculate the aforementioned integrability conditions through the Gotay-Nester algorithm. The idea is that, although the system initially considered is highly non\nregular, there exists (via Cartan-Kuranishi) a prolongation which is regular6 , and\nthe Dirac constraints can be determined by our theorem 4.5: Therefore if we know\nthe Dirac constraints, we know something about the prolonged EDS. In particular,\nthe integrability conditions must arise as these kind of constraints.\nTherefore we need to formulate the EDS as a non standard variational problem;\nthus let us define the double fibration\n\u039b := R7 \u2192 \u039b1 := R4 \u2192 M := R3\n(x, y, z, \u03c6, p, q, r) 7\u2192 (x, y, z, \u03c6) 7\u2192 (x, y, z) ,\ntaking as prolongations structure the given EDS I, and as lagrangian the trivial one\n\u03bb = 0. In order to build an associated Lepagean equivalent problem, we consider\n\u039b\u0303 := \u039b \u2295\n\n2\n^\n\n(T \u2217 M ) \u2295 R2\n\n6 There remains the question of regularity of the foliation introduced in order to define the\npresymplectic space; it is supposed that this condition is fulfilled.\n\n\fCONSTRAINTS, FIELD THEORY AND EDS\n\n33\n\nwith coordinates (x, y, z, \u03c6, p, q, r; \u03b1, \u03bb, \u03bc), \u03b1 = Adx\u2227dy+Bdx\u2227dz+Cdy\u2227dz, \u03bc, \u03bb \u2208\nR; the functional to be extremized will be\n\u02c6\n(\u03b1 \u2227 \u03b8 + \u03bb\u03931 + \u03bc\u03932 ) .\nS :=\nM\n\nWe know that it is a covariant Lepage equivalent problem; the following lemma\nshows that it is also contravariant.\nLemma 5.1. The projection\n\u03bd : \u039b\u0303 \u2192 \u039b : (x, y, z, \u03c6, p, q, r; \u03b1, \u03bb, \u03bc) 7\u2192 (x, y, z, \u03c6, p, q, r)\nmaps extremals of S into integral sections for I; conversely, for each integral section\nof I given by\n(x, y, z) 7\u2192 (x, y, z, \u03c6, p, q, r)\nthere exists \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a92 (M ) , \u03bb, \u03bc \u2208 C \u221e (M ) such that joined to the integral section\ngives rise to an extremal of S.\nProof. The variations respect to \u03b1, \u03bc and \u03bb gives us the generators of I, so its\nprojection will be an integral section of I. The variations respect to \u03c6, p, q and r\nleads to\n\uf8f1\nd\u03b1 = 0,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2yd\u03bb \u2227 dy \u2227 dz + \u03b1 \u2227 dx = 0,\n\uf8f4\nd\u03bc \u2227 dx \u2227 dz + \u03b1 \u2227 dy = 0,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\nd\u03bb \u2227 dx \u2227 dy + \u03b1 \u2227 dz = 0.\nThis system is equivalent to\n\n\uf8f1\nAz \u2212 By + Cx = 0,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2y\u03bb + C = 0,\nx\n\uf8f4\n\u03bcy + B = 0,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\u03bbz + A = 0;\n\nin order to find a solution to it, we take \u03bb arbitrary, and define C and A by using the\nsecond and fourth equation respectively. From third equation we can determine B\nonce \u03bc is known, and the first of them gives us a differential equation for \u03bc, namely\n\u03bcyy = \u03bbzz + y\u03bbxx .\nSo the system has solutions, and our new variational problem is contravariant.\n5.5.1.

In order\n\u22a5\nto find out the elements in (T M1) , let us use the remark made in the subsection\n\n\fCONSTRAINTS, FIELD THEORY AND EDS\n\n35\n\u22a5\n\n5.3: If F is a constraint, and it admits a hamiltonian vector, then XF \u2208 (T M1 ) .\nLet us take the constraints qy = 0 y \u03c6y \u2212 q = 0; none of them has a hamiltonian\nvector field, although the consequence \u03c6yy = 0 admits such a vector. Therefore the\nfunction\n\u02c6\n\u03c6yy f1 dx \u2227 dy\n\nF1 :=\n\nR2\n\n\u0001\n(where f1 \u2208 C \u221e R2 is arbitrary) has a hamiltonian vector field. In fact, from the\nequation\n\u03c9 z (XF1 , X2 ) = dF1 (X2 )\nand taking into account that\ndF1 (X2 ) =\n=\n\n\u02c6\n\n\u02c6R\n\n2\n\nR2\n\nwe conclude that\n\n(\u03b4\u03c62 )yy f1 dx \u2227 dy\n\u03b4\u03c62 (f1 )yy dx \u2227 dy\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\nXF1 = 0, 0, 0, 0; (f1 )yy dx \u2227 dy, 0, 0 .\n\u22a5\n\nTherefore we see that (T M1 ) = ker \u03c9 z \u2295 hXF1 i, and we are ready to calculate the\nsecondary constraints.\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u22a5\n= 0\nSecondary constraints. These constraints are obtained from dH z (T M1 )\nz\nz\nand we know that on M1 , dH (ker\u03c9 ) is identically zero; then\n0 = dH z (XF1 )\n\u02c6\n=\u2212\nr (f1 )yy dx \u2227 dy\n2\n\u02c6R\nryy f1 dx \u2227 dy\n=\u2212\n\n\u21d2\n\nryy = 0.\n\nR2\n\nLet us now define C2 := C1 \u222a{ryy } and M2 := {C2 = 0}. By using the additional\nconstraint ryy we can define\n\u02c6\nryy f2 dx \u2227 dy\nF2 :=\nR2\n\nand so\ndF2 (X2 ) =\n\n\u02c6\n\nR2\n\n(\u03b4r2 )yy f2 dx \u2227 dy =\n\n\u02c6\n\nR2\n\n\u03b4r2 (f2 )yy dx \u2227 dy;\n\nthe associated hamiltonian vector field is\n\u0010\n\u0011\nXF2 = 0, 0, 0, 0; 0, (f2 )yy , 0 .\n\nIt is the complementary vector we were looking for, and so (T M2)\u22a5 = (T M1 )\u22a5 \u2295\nhXF2 i.

Now C3 := C2 \u222a {\u03c6xxy } and let M3 be its zero locus. Continuing with the algorithm, we need to find the vectors in the symplectic orthogonal\nto T M3 associated to the (new) constraints functions. So we define\n\u02c6\nf3 \u03c6xxy dx \u2227 dy,\nF3 :=\nR2\n\nand its derivative along X2 will read\n\u02c6\nf3 (\u03b4\u03c62 )xxy dx \u2227 dy\ndF3 (X2 ) =\nR2\n\u02c6\n(f3 )xxy \u03b4\u03c62 dx \u2227 dy.\n=\u2212\nR2\n\nThen\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\nXF3 = 0, 0, 0, 0; \u2212 (f3 )xxy dx \u2227 dy, 0, 0 ,\n\ntherefore (T M3 )\u22a5 = (T M2 )\u22a5 \u2295 hXF3 i, and from here we obtain the new constraint\n0 = dH z (XF3 )\n\u02c6\n=\nr (f3 )xxy dx \u2227 dy\nR2\n\u02c6\n=\u2212\nrxxy f3 dx \u2227 dy\n\n\u21d2\n\nrxxy = 0.\n\nR2\n\nQuaternary constraints. We define C4 := C3 \u222a {rxxy } and M4 := {C4 = 0}. Then if\n\u02c6\nF4 :=\nf4 rxxy dx \u2227 dy\nR2\n\n \u0301\n\nwe have that dF4 (X2 ) = \u2212 R2 (f4 )xxy \u03b4r2 dx \u2227 dy, and the new vector in (T M4 )\nwill be\n\u0010\n\u0011\nXF4 = 0, 0, 0, 0; 0, \u2212 (f4 )xxy , 0 .\n\nThen we have that (T M4 )\u22a5 = (T M3 )\u22a5 \u2295 hXF3 i, and for the new constraint\n0 = dH z (XF2 )\n\u02c6\n=\u2212\nypx (f4 )xxy dx \u2227 dy\n2\n\u02c6 R\n=\n(ypx )xxy f4 dx \u2227 dy\nR2\n\n\u21d2\n\n(ypx )xxy = 0.\n\nBut on M4\n(ypx )xxy = (y\u03c6xx )xxy = (y\u03c6xxxx )y = \u03c6xxxx + y\u03c6xxy = \u03c6xxxx ,\ngiving rise to the constraint \u03c6xxxx = 0.\n\n\u22a5\n\n\fCONSTRAINTS, FIELD THEORY AND EDS\n\n37\n\nFifth order constraints. With the definitions C5 := C4 \u222a {\u03c6xxxx } , M5 := {C5 = 0}\nand\n\u02c6\nF5 :=\nf5 \u03c6xxxx dx \u2227 dy\nR2\n \u0301\nwe have that dH z (X2 ) = R2 (f5 )xxxx \u03b4\u03c62 dx \u2227 dy, so\nXF5 = (0, 0, 0, 0; (f5 )xxxx dx \u2227 dy, 0, 0) .\n\u22a5\n\n\u22a5\n\nThe new symplectic complement is given by (T M5) = (T M4 ) \u2295 hXF5 i. Thus it\nis obtained a new constraint from\n0 = dH z (XF5 )\n\u02c6\nrxxxx f5 dx \u2227 dy\n=\n\n\u21d2\n\nrxxxx = 0.\n\nR2\n\nTermination of the algorithm. Let us define M6 \u2282 M5 as the\n \u0301 zero locus of rxxxx\nin M5 ; by adding the hamiltonian vector field of F6 := R2 f6 rxxxx dx \u2227 dy to\n\u22a5\n\u22a5\n(T M5 ) , we obtain the vector space (T M6 ) ; it can be proved that the function\nz\ndH (XF6 ) is identically zero on M6 , and we can conclude that it is an invariant\nsubmanifold of \u0393 (N0 ). By performing an elimination of the auxiliar variables on\nthe set of constraints C6 := C5 \u222a {rxxxx } and keeping those involving only the\noriginal variables x, y, z, \u03c6, we see that the integrability constraints must be \u03c6xxy =\n0, \u03c6xxxx = 0. A note of caution about the applicability of the method is that this\nelimination process can in principle be as involved as the problem of finding the\noriginal integrability conditions.\n5.6. Non regular EDS and Gotay-Nester algorithm failure. We want to\nconstruct an example where the Dirac method fails in some sense; in order to do\nthat, we will use the approach to variational problems developed here. The rationale\nbehind this is the following: We know from the theorem 4.5 that whenever the EDS\nassociated to the equations of motion admits regular elements, there exists a oneto-one correspondence between the solutions for this EDS and the solutions for the\ndynamical system on the sections of the selected spatial slice. Therefore we need\nto find a variational problem whose extremals are described for an EDS with non\nregular integral elements. Concretely, we will take a system where the non regularity\nstems from singularities of the set of integral elements: this lack of regularity cannot\nbe circumvected via prolongation, and the Dirac method would fail. So the Gotay\nalgorithm could run into problems in facing them.\n5.6.1. Initial setting. Let us consider the EDS I generated by\n\u03b81 := du \u2212 qdx, \u03b82 := dv \u2212 qdr\n6\n\non \u039b := R with coordinates (x, y, u, v, q, r); the independence condition is dx\u2227dy 6=\n0. The idea is the one given in example 4, that is, by considering that I as the ideal\ndefining a prolongation structure on \u039b, which has the double fibration structure via\n\u039b \u2192 \u039b1 := R4 \u2192 M := R2\n(x, y, u, v, q, r) 7\u2192 (x, y, u, v) 7\u2192 (x, y) ,\nand by taking the lagrangian \u03bb = 0. Using\nour prescriptions,\nthe Lepage equivalent\n\u0001\n\u0001\nwill be constructed on \u039b\u0303 := R2 \u00d7 R4 \u2295 T \u2217 R2 \u2295 T \u2217 R2 , with action\n\u02c6\n(\u03b1 \u2227 \u03b81 + \u03b2 \u2227 \u03b82 ) ,\nS :=\nR2\n\n\f38\n\nSANTIAGO CAPRIOTTI\n\nwhere \u03b1 = adx + bdy, \u03b2 = mdx + ndy. We need to prove that it is a bivariant\nLepage equivalent problem.\nLemma 5.3. The projection\n\u03bd : (x, y, u, v, q, r, \u03b1, \u03b2) 7\u2192 (x, y, u, v, q, r)\n\u0011\n\u0010\nmakes \u039b\u0303, 0, \u03b1 \u2227 \u03b81 + \u03b2 \u2227 \u03b82 into a Lepagean equivalent of (\u039b, I, 0). Furthermore,\nit is bivariant, that is, every extremal of the variational problem posed by S on\nsections of \u039b\u0303 projects on an integral section of I (because the lagrangian is trivial,\nthere are no action to work with here) and conversely, every integral section of I\ncan be lifted to an extremal of S.\nProof. The variations along \u03b1 and \u03b2 will give us the generators for I; this shows\nthat it is a covariant Lepage equivalent problem. On the other side, variations along\nu, v, q and r leads to the following system on \u03b1 and \u03b2:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4d\u03b1 = 0,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2d\u03b2 = 0,\n\uf8f4\u03b2 \u2227 dr + \u03b1 \u2227 dx = 0,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\nd (q\u03b2) = 0.\n\nFor every (x, y) 7\u2192 (u, v, q, r) integral section for I, this systems admits solutions,\nso it is contravariant also.\n\n5.6.2. Gotay-Nester algorithm. Now we start with the analysis of the dynamical\nequations associated to the regular slicing y = 0. In order to do that, we take\nN0 \u2282 \u039b\u0303 the submanifold composed by the points in \u039b\u0303 such that y = 0; it is a bundle\non R, and our next task is to define on its space of sections a presymplectic structure\nand a hamiltonian function. The first thing to note is that for \u03bb\u0303 := \u03b1 \u2227 \u03b81 + \u03b2 \u2227 \u03b82\nd\u03bb\u0303 = d\u03b1 \u2227 (du \u2212 qdx) + \u03b1 \u2227 dq \u2227 dx + d\u03b2 \u2227 (dv \u2212 qdr) + \u03b2 \u2227 dq \u2227 dr,\nso\nd\u03bb\u0303\n\nN0\n\n= da \u2227 dx \u2227 du + dm \u2227 dx \u2227 (dv \u2212 qdr) + mdx \u2227 dq \u2227 dr.\n\nTherefore if\nXi = (\u03b4ui , \u03b4vi , \u03b4qi , \u03b4ri ; \u03b4\u03b1i , \u03b4\u03b2i ) ,\n\ni = 1, 2\n\ndenotes a pair of arbitrary elements in T \u0393 (N0 ), the presymplectic structure will be\ny\n\n\u03c9 (X1 , X2 ) =\n\n\u02c6 h\nR\n\nand\n\n\u2212 \u03b4a1 \u03b4u2 \u2212 \u03b4m1 \u03b4v2 \u2212 m\u03b4r1 \u03b4q2 +\ni\n+ (q\u03b4m1 + m\u03b4q1 ) \u03b4r2 + \u03b4u1 \u03b4a2 + (\u03b4v1 \u2212 q\u03b4r1 ) \u03b4m2 dx\nHy =\n\n\u02c6\n\nR\n\n[b (ux \u2212 q) + n (vx \u2212 qrx )] dx.\n\n\fCONSTRAINTS, FIELD THEORY AND EDS\n\nPrimary constraints.

This is a very bad behaviour of\nthe Gotay-Nester algorithm, and it has to do with the singular nature of the new\nconstraints.\n5.6.3. EDS analysis. The analysis of this PDE system is interesting, because its set\nof integral elements consists of several parts, each of them with different regularity\nbehaviour. In fact, we will see that these differences introduces the singularities in\nthe Gotay-Nester algorithm.\nThe integral elements for I divides into two sets: the set W consisting of the\nelements with qx = 0, and U3 is the set of integral elements such that n = b = 0.\nNone of them has regular elements; in particular, the elements in U3 has 0-forms\nin its definition, so this set needs to be redefined. The procedure is to pull back\nthe original EDS I to the submanifold defined by the collection of problematic 0forms. It gives rise to a new EDS I3 whose set of integral elements admits a new\ndecomposition into a pair of subsets V1 and V3 . The set V3 is characterized by the\n0-form constraint m = 0, and will not be studied; the set V1 is composed by regular\nelements. Additionally the prolongation of the portion of the EDS\n\u0001 corresponding\nto the elements in W gives rise to a new EDS IW on G2 T R10 which is regular\ntoo.\nTherefore it is necessary to know the main characteristics of our EDS I; first of all,\na set of algebraic generators will be\n{\u03b81 , \u03b82 , dq \u2227 dx, dq \u2227 dr, d\u03b1, d\u03b2, \u03b2 \u2227 dr + \u03b1 \u2227 dx, \u03b2 \u2227 dq} .\nNow we proceed to calculate the (reduced) characters for the flag E0 := 0 \u2282 E1 :=\nhv1 i \u2282 E := hv1 , v2 i, where\nv1 := \u2202x + U1 \u2202u + V1 \u2202v + Q1 \u2202q + R1 \u2202r + A1 \u2202a + B1 \u2202b + M1 \u2202m + N1 \u2202n ,\nv2 := \u2202y + U2 \u2202u + V2 \u2202v + Q2 \u2202q + R2 \u2202r + A2 \u2202a + B2 \u2202b + M2 \u2202m + N2 \u2202n\nare in T(x,y,u,v,q,r) R10 .

Moreover we have that codimE W = 9, so there are no regular elements in\nW.\nOn U3 we must take care of the fact that it is defined through 0-forms, namely,\nthe constraints n = 0 and b = 0. The regularity of I must be studied through the\nregularity of the EDS I3 obtained from I by pulling back to the submanifold\n\u039b\u03033 := {(x, y, u, v, q, r, a, 0, m, 0) : x, y, u, v, q, r, a, m \u2208 R} ;\na set of generators for I3 will be\n{\u03b81 , \u03b82 , dq \u2227 dx, dq \u2227 dr, da \u2227 dx, dm \u2227 dx, mdx \u2227 dr, mdx \u2227 dq} .\nThen if\nw1 := \u2202x + U1 \u2202u + V1 \u2202v + Q1 \u2202q + R1 \u2202r + A1 \u2202a + M1 \u2202m ,\nw2 := \u2202y + U2 \u2202u + V2 \u2202v + Q2 \u2202q + R2 \u2202r + A2 \u2202a + M2 \u2202m\n7 In\n\npoints where m = 0, some of the characters decrease by one.\n\n\f42\n\nSANTIAGO CAPRIOTTI\n\nthe set of 2-integral elements V2 (I3 ) is described by the equations\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\nU1 = q, U2 = 0,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2V1 = qR1 , V2 = 0,\nU3\u2032 : Q2 = 0, Q1 R2 = 0,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nA2 = 0, M2 = 0,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3mR = 0.\n2\nThus we will have that U3\u2032 = V1 \u222a V3 , where\n\uf8f1\nU1 = q, U2 = 0,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2V = qR , V = 0,\n1\n1\n2\nV1 :\n\uf8f4\nQ2 = 0, R2 = 0,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\nA2 = 0, M2 = 0,\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\nU1 = q, U2 = 0,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2V1 = qR1 , V2 = 0,\nV3 : Q2 = 0, Q1 = 0,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nA2 = 0, M2 = 0,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3m = 0\n\n(21)\n\nand codimE V1 = 8.

Therefore, the integral elements\nin V1 are regular.\nFinally it is necessary to consider the prolongation of the set W , in order to see if\nsome of its elements can be considered as the tangent space of some solution. The\nprolongation of an EDS I \u2282 \u03a9\u2022 (M ) is the pullback of the contact EDS on G2 (T M )\nto the set V2 (I).

Return to Gotay-Nester algorithm. Nevertheless, it can be instructive to\ndesingularize these constraints by mimicking the finite dimensional procedure: That\nis, by considering that the sections fulfilling the problematic constraints are the\nunion of the sections such that n = b = 0 with the set of sections satisfying the\nsingle constraint qx = 0. Despite the validity of such a procedure, we consider the\ncontinuation of the algorithm in each of these sets.\n\u2022 Case n = b = 0.

Some remarks. It must be noted that there exists a field theory whose Dirac\nconstraints has similar behaviour to the constraints found in the last example: It is\nthe system composed of a massless spin 1 charged particle and the electromagnetic\nfield [14]. A detailed analysis of such a system from the point of view adopted in\nthis article is being performed; the true nature of the problems encountered there\nis under investigation yet [7]. Nevertheless, it is interesting to note here that the\nnon standard perspective permits us to analyse any EDS (in particular, any PDE\nsystem) using techniques of (pre)symplectic geometry. The example 5.5 is a sample\nin this direction.\n6. Conclusions. In this paper it was built an entire dynamical theory for non\nstandard variational problems, at least for those admitting a Cartan form. We were\nable also to describe the constraint submanifold in every case where such a description is possible. It was proved that this submanifold is the space of integral sections\nof an EDS which is associated to the EDS generated by the Hamilton-Cartan equations and the slicing of the space-time. We saw that the Dirac constraints has two\nsources: They can arise from the differential closure of the Hamilton-Cartan EDS,\nalthough some others can appears because of the involutiveness requeriment, which\nis a consequence of the stability condition defining the constraint submanifold. Four\nrelevant examples showing these aspects were discussed in some extent.\nAcknowledgements.

The purpose of this appendix\nis to set some common facts about geometrical concepts involved in the description\nof spaces of sections and the variational calculus used throughout the work [15, 16].\nA.1. Variational derivative. Given the bundle F \u2192 B, let us consider on \u0393 (F )\na monoparametric family \u03c3t of sections such that \u03c30 = \u03c3; for every b \u2208 B we can\ncalculate the following vector\n~d\n[\u03c3t (b)]\n\u2208 T\u03c3(b) F\nV (b) :=\ndt\nt=0\n\n\f46\n\nSANTIAGO CAPRIOTTI\n\nwhich has the following properties:\n\u2022 It is a vertical vector, that is, it belongs to ker (\u03c4\u2217 ).\n\u2022 The map b 7\u2192 V (b) covers \u03c3, that is, it makes the following diagram commutative\nVF\nV \u2712\n\u03c4\nF\n\nB\n\n\u2744\n\u2732 F\n\u03c3\n\nTherefore V is a section of the pullback bundle \u03c3 \u2217 (V F ). So we make the following\ndefinition.\nDefinition A.1. The tangent space at \u03c3 of the space of sections \u0393 (F ) of a bundle\n\u03c4\nF \u2212\u2192 B is the space of sections \u0393 (\u03c3 \u2217 (V F )).\nNote. We want to remark that the previous one is just a definition, and does not\nimplies the existence of differential structure in particular cases.\nNow we proceed in the opposite direction: Let us suppose that we have an\nelement V \u2208 \u0393 (\u03c3 \u2217 (V F )), and we need to build a monoparametric family of sections\n\u03c3t \u2208 \u0393 (F ) such that\n\u2022 They satisfies the initial condition \u03c30 = \u03c3.\n\u2022 The section V can be reconstructed through the formula\nV (b) :=\n\n~d\n[\u03c3t (b)]\ndt\n\nt=0\n\n.\n\nThis is the case when V admits an extension9 V\u0302 \u2208 \u0393 (V F ); in general it is a problem\nwith no solution. Nevertheless there exists a particular case for which there always\nexists such an extension, namely whenever F is a vector bundle.\n\u03c4\n\nProposition 6. Let F \u2212\u2192 B a vector bundle, \u03c3 \u2208 \u0393 (F ) a section and V \u2208\n\u0393 (\u03c3 \u2217 (V F )) a tangent vector at \u03c3. Then there exists V\u0302 \u2208 \u0393 (V F ) which extends V .\nProof. Because F is a vector bundle, we have the identification V\u03c3(b) (F ) \u2243 \u03c4 \u22121 (b),\nand then we can consider V as a section for F . Then defining the family of sections\n\u03c3t : b 7\u2192 \u03c3 (b) + tV (b) we obtain a vector field on F (the tangent vector field)\nextending the given vector.\nA functional on F is a function on \u0393 (F ) (from a set-theoretical point of view).\nWe say that a functional S on F is differentiable at \u03c3 \u2208 \u0393 (F ) iff for every extensible\nV \u2208 \u0393 (\u03c3 \u2217 (V F )) the number\nd\n(S [\u03c6t (\u03c3)])\ndt\nt=0\nexists and it is independent of the extension. Here \u03c6t : \u0393 (F ) \u2192 \u0393 (F ) is the flux\nin \u0393 (F ) defined through \u03c8t : F \u2192 F, \u03c80 = id\u039b1 associated to some extension for V\n(that is, \u03c6t (\u03c3) : b 7\u2192 (\u03c8t \u25e6 \u03c3) (b)). With respect to this subclass of functionals we\ndefine the variational derivative.\nV |\u03c3 * S :=\n\n9 This\n\nto V\n\nmeans that there exist on F a vector field V\u0302 whose restriction to the image of \u03c3 is equal\n\n\fCONSTRAINTS, FIELD THEORY AND EDS\n\n47\n\nDefinition A.2. The variational derivative of the differentiable functional S in\n\u03c3 \u2208 \u0393 (F ) is the form \u03b4S [\u03c3] : T\u03c3 \u0393 (F ) \u2192 R, given by\n\u03b4S [\u03c3] (V ) = V |\u03c3 * S.\nRemark 2. The uniqueness of the derivative of a functional depends strongly on\neach case; it has to do with the choice of the extension of the vector V .\nA.2. Variational derivative for special functionals. We want to study the\nvariational derivative of some class of differentiable functionals on F , that is, those\nthat can be given by the formula\n\u02c6\n\u03c3 \u2217 (\u03bb)\nS\u03bb [\u03c3] :=\nB\n\nn\n\nfor some \u03bb \u2208 \u03a9 (F ) , n = dim B.\nProposition 7. [13] The variational derivative for S\u03bb at \u03c3 is given by\n\u02c6\n\u0001\n\u03c3 \u2217 LV\u0302 \u03bb ,\n\u03b4S\u03bb [\u03c3] (V ) =\nB\n\nwhere V\u0302 \u2208 \u0393 (V F ) is some extension for V . In particular, on these kind of functionals the variational derivative is unique.\nAppendix B. Some facts about exterior differential systems. In this section\nwe introduce the basic concepts of the theory of EDS; the sources of the material\npresented here are [5, 22, 23, 25]. The problem is to find out conditions that ensures\nus the existence of submanifolds on which a certain set of forms vanish. Since any\nof such submanifold annihilates the algebraic ideal generated by these forms and its\ndifferentials, let us introduce the following definition.\nDefinition B.1. An exterior differential system on the manifold M is an ideal\nI \u2282 \u03a9\u2022 (M ) closed with respect to the exterior differential operator. We say then\nthat I is differentially closed. A manifold which annihilates all the elements in I is\ncalled integral submanifold of the EDS.\nIt will be supposed that the EDS does not contain 0-forms; it is not a true\nrestriction in cases where the zero locus of these 0-forms is a submanifold of M . In\norder to build up the integral submanifolds of a given EDS, we find out the planes\n(of the corresponding dimension) that annihilates I, asking about the conditions\nunder which these planes are tangent to some submanifold. The following definition\nis motivated by these ideas.\nDefinition B.2. An integral element of dimension k for an EDS I is a subspace\nE \u2282 Tx M of dimension k such that \u03b1|E = 0 for all \u03b1 \u2208 I. The set of k-integral\nelements associated to a given I will be denoted by Vk (I), and it is naturally\nincluded in the manifold Gk (T M ), the k-grassmannian on M .\nThe verification that a given subspace is integral for some EDS involves the\nresolution of a (mostly large) linear system, as the following fact shows.\nLemma B.3. Let us define I k := I \u2229 \u03a9k (M ); moreover, let us fix\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u03b111 , * * * , \u03b11k1 , \u03b121 , * * * , \u03b12k2 , * * * , \u03b1p1 , * * * , \u03b1pkp \u2282 \u03a9\u2022 (M )\n\b\na set of generators (in the algebraic sense) for the EDS I such that \u03b1l1 , * * * , \u03b1lkl \u2282\nI l for all l. Then\n\n\f48\n\nSANTIAGO CAPRIOTTI\n\n\b\n\u2022 Vk (I) |x = E \u2208 Gk (Tx M ) : \u03b1|E = 0 \u2200\u03b1 \u2208 I k .\n\u2022 The subspace E \u2282 Tx M is r-integral for I if and only if \u03b1m\nl |E = 0 for all\n1 \u2264 l \u2264 km and 1 \u2264 m \u2264 r.\nIt is important to note that in order to verify integrability in terms of algebraic\ngenerators of an EDS, it is necessary to prove that the given subspace annihilates\nall the generators of degree less than or equal to its dimension.\n\u03c4\nIf the EDS I is defined on a bundle F \u2212\u2192 B, we ask about integral submanifolds\nwhich are sections of the given bundle, called integral sections 10 ; if n = dimB, the\nprocedure that allows to find them works by fixing a nonzero element \u03a9 \u2208 \u03a9n (B)\nand looking for n-integral manifolds for I on which \u03c4 \u2217 (\u03a9) 6= 0. This discussion\nmotivates the following definition.\nDefinition B.4. An EDS with independence condition on a manifold M is a pair\n(I, \u03a9) composed by an EDS I and a differential n-form \u03a9. The integral elements\n(resp. submanifolds) of such an object are the integral elements (resp. submanifolds) of I such that \u03a9 6= 0 on them.\nThe independence condition, although apparently innocuous, changes dramatically the analysis of an EDS, as we will see in the discussion on the Cartan-K\u00e4hler\ntheorem.\nB.1. K\u00e4hler-ordinary integral elements. First we need to speak about the notions of regularity which are necessary in the hypothesis of the Cartan-K\u00e4hler theorem. The first thing that we have to impose is the regularity condition for the\nintegral elements in the differential geometric sense.\nDefinition B.5. Let I \u2282 \u03a9\u2022 (M ) be a EDS. An n-integral element E \u2208 Vn (I)\nis K\u00e4hler-ordinary iff there exists a neighborhood E \u2208 U \u2282 Gn (T M ) such that\nU \u2229 Vn (I) is a submanifold of Gn (T M ).\nThis is a typical requeriment which ensures (at least locally) a description of the\nset of n-integral elements as the level set of some differentiable functions. In general\nthe sets Vn (I) are algebraic subvarieties of Gn (T M ) and so there exists singular\npoints.\nB.2. Polar spaces and K\u00e4hler-regularity. In order to build up integral submanifolds of dimension n from an integral submanifold of (n \u2212 1)-dimensional, we\nneed to consider the possible directions in which it is possible.\nDefinition B.6. Given an element E \u2208 Vk (I), we will define its polar space as the\nsubspace generated for all the integral elements of dimension k + 1 associated to I\nwhich contains E. The polar space for an integral element E will be denoted by\nH (E).\nThe following lemma gives us a way in which we can calculate a polar space.\nLemma B.7. If E \u2282 Tx X and {v1 , * * * , vk } is a basis of E, then\n\b\nH (E) = w \u2208 Tx X : \u03c6 (v1 , * * * , vk , w) = 0, \u2200\u03c6 \u2208 I k+1 .\n10 The\n\nset of integral sections for an EDS on a fiber bundle will be denoted by the symbol \u0393 (I).\n\n\fCONSTRAINTS, FIELD THEORY AND EDS\n\n49\n\nFrom the previous lemma we get some intuition about how the polar spaces are\ndetermined. That is, supposing that I has generators like in lemma B.3 and that\nE = hv1 , * * * , vn i; the vector x \u2208 Tx X will belongs to H (E) iff\n\uf8f1\n2\n1 \u2264 \u03bd \u2264 k2 , 1 \u2264 i1 \u2264 n\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\u03b1\u03bd (vi1 , x) = 0,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\u03b13\u03bc (vj1 , vj2 , x) = 0,\n1 \u2264 \u03bc \u2264 k3 , 1 \u2264 j1 < j2 \u2264 n\n(23)\n..\n..\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n.\n.\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\u03b1n+1\n(v1 , * * * , vn , x) = 0, 1 \u2264 \u03c3 \u2264 kn+1 .\n\u03c3\nSo, instead of having a set of algebraic equations, we have a linear system determining x, which depends on a flag in E; the next notion to be introduced assures the\nregularity of this system, in the sense that it deals with the invariance of its rank.\nDefinition B.8. A K\u00e4hler-ordinary element E \u2208 Vn (I) is K\u00e4hler-regular if\ncodimH (E) = codimH (E \u2032 )\nfor all E \u2032 belonging to a neighborhood of E in Vn (I) \u2282 Gn (T X).\nWe need to develop some strategies in order to deal with this condition, because\nit is difficult to verify in practice. The main theoretical resource in this direction is\nthe Cartan's Test for Involutivity.\nTheorem B.9 (Cartan's Test for involutivity). Let Ek , 0 \u2264 k \u2264 n a flag of integral\nelements for I at x, and let us define\nck := codimH (Ek ) , 0 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2212 1.\nThen\ncodimEn Vn (I) \u2265 c0 + * * * + cn\u22121 ,\nwhere the codimension of Vn (I) at En is measured in the algebraic sense: It is\ndefined as the maximum number of smooth functions on Gn (T X) which vanish on\nVn (I) and has independent differentials at En .\nMoreover, Vn (I) is smooth of codimension exactly c0 + * * * + cn\u22121 at En if and\nonly if the Ek are all K\u00e4hler-regular for 0 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2212 1.\nB.3. Cartan-K\u00e4hler Theorem. Once we have introduced all the necessary ingredients, we can formulate a version of the Cartan-K\u00e4hler Theorem [22, 23].\nTheorem B.10 (Cartan-K\u00e4hler Theorem). Assume I is an analytic EDS on M\nand P n \u2282 M is an analytic submanifold which is K\u00e4hler-regular and such that, at\neach p \u2208 P , H (Tp P ) has dimension n + r + 1. Moreover, let us assume that R \u2282 M\nis an analytic submanifold of codimension r such that P \u2282 R and Tp R intersects\ntransversely with H (Tp P ). Then for each p \u2208 P there is a neighborhood U \u2282 R of\np and a unique analytic (n + 1)-dimensional integral manifold N \u2282 U containing\nP \u2229 U.\nThe main drawback of this theorem is that we need to work in the analytic\nsetting; for the systems which we consider here this hypothesis is fulfilled, although\nit is important to remark that it is a strong condition to be required.\n\n\f50\n\nSANTIAGO CAPRIOTTI\n\nB.4. Cartan-Kuranishi Theorem. According to the Cartan's test for involutivity, we can apply the Cartan-K\u00e4hler theorem only in those cases in which the\ncodimension of the set of integral elements has the appropiate value. It can happen\nthat the integral manifolds we are looking for cannot be obtained by using this existence theorem. For example, to ensure that the set of 3-integral sections for an EDS\ncan be obtained by restriction of 4-integral sections to some particular submanifold,\nthe hypothesis of the Cartan-K\u00e4hler theorem needs to be verified for each 3-integral\nsection. These ideas motivate the following concept, central in the theory of PDEs.\nDefinition B.11. Let I \u2282 \u03a9\u2022 (M ) be an EDS on M , and E \u2208 Vn (I). A flag\n0 \u2282 E1 \u2282 * * * \u2282 En = E is a regular flag iff Ek is a regular k-integral element of I\nfor 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2212 1.\nThe regular flags allows us to solve the PDE behind an EDS as a sucession of\nCauchy-Kowalevky problems; we can introduce a fundamental concept related to\nthe integrability of the underlying PDE.\nDefinition B.12. An EDS is n-involutive iff every n-integral element is the terminus of a regular flag.\nThe main consequence of this definition and the Cartan-K\u00e4hler theorem is the\nfollowing proposition (see for example [5]).\nProposition 8. If an EDS is n-involutive, through any n-integral element passes\nan integral manifold of dimension n.\nOne may prove there exists an operation, called prolongation, which allows us to\nassociate to every EDS I on a manifold M and every n \u2208 N a new EDS I \u2032 on a\nmanifold M \u2032 such that\n\u2022 There exists a submersion p : M \u2032 \u2192 M , and\n\u2022 the n-integrals elements of I and I \u2032 are in one to one correspondence via the\nmap p.\nThe key point is that, under certain technical assumptions [5], after a finite number\nof prolongations one can obtain an involutive EDS: This fact is known as CartanKuranishi theorem. In this work we are assuming that these technical requeriments\nare fulfilled elsewhere.\nReferences\n[1] Ralph Abraham and Jerrold E. Marsden. \"Foundations of Mechanics\".
