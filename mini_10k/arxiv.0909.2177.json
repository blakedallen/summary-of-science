The reason of this interest come from the works G.W. Mackey\n([Ma]) and Birkhoff-von Neumann ([B-vN]), in which they axiomatize the quantum logic\nwith the lattice of closed subspaces (or equivalently the lattice of projections) of a separable\nHilbert space. But we have in mind to use a characterization of Hilbert lattices in order\nto attach the Connes' embedding conjecture ([Co]) via lattice theory and using a very\nfamous theorem of Kirchberg ([Ki]). For this reason we need a different characterization\nof Hilbert lattices. It should be based only on algebraic properties and it should describe\nin the most precise way what happens in the finite dimensional case, i.e. in the case\nof the n \u00d7 n matrices on the complex field. The nearest approach we meet is strangely\nthe first one: during the years 1935-38 J. von Neumann found an axiomatization for the\nprojections lattice of a finite factor, but he used some axioms that we will not use. In\nparticular we don't assume the existence of a transition probability, cutting off at least\nten of the eighteen von Neumann's axioms. Obviously our construction loses of generality:\nit will be valid only in the case of finite factor of type I, i.e. Mn (C). Successively we\nare able to extend our construction to the separable case. At last we describe a possible\nsecond theorem of correspondence that should refine the first one arriving to the \"minimal\naxiomatization\" of the projections lattice of Mn (C), in which we are able to cut off other\naxioms.\nSo, our approach is similar to the von Neumann's one. This is why we want to compare\nthese two approaches in this preliminary section.\nLet us recall the following\nDefinition 1. (von Neumann, [vN-H2]) A continuous geometry with transition\nprobability is a system (L, \u2264,\u22a5 , P ) verifying the following axioms\n1. \u2264 is a partial ordering on L.\n\n2\n\n\f2. Each subset of L admits greatest lower bound and least upper bound. We set\nl \u2228 l\u2032 = sup{l, l\u2032 }, l \u2227 l\u2032 = inf {l, l\u2032 }, 0 = inf (L), 1 = sup(L).\n3. \u2228 and \u2227 are continuous in the following sense\n(a) If {li } is an increasing net in L and l \u2208 L, then\n_\n_\n(l \u2227 li ) = l \u2227\nli\ni\n\ni\n\n(b) If {li } is a decreasing net in L and l \u2208 L, then\n^\n^\n(l \u2228 li ) = l \u2228\nli\ni\n\ni\n\n4. The modular property holds\nl \u2264 l\u2032\u2032 \u21d2 (l \u2228 l\u2032 ) \u2227 l\u2032\u2032 = l \u2228 (l\u2032 \u2227 l\u2032\u2032 ) \u2200l\u2032 \u2208 L\n5. l \u2192 l\u22a5 is an involutory anti-automorphism of L, i.e. l\u22a5\u22a5 = l and l \u2264 l\u2032 implies\nl\u2032\u22a5 \u2264 l\u22a5 .\n6. l \u2264 l\u22a5 if and only if l = 0.\n7. We say that l, l\u2032 are inverse if l \u2228 l\u2032 = 1 and l \u2227 l\u2032 = 0. This axiom requires that if\nl, l\u2032 and l, l\u2032\u2032 are inverse, it cannot be l\u2032 < l\u2032\u2032 .\n8. P : L \\ {0} \u00d7 L \u2192 [0, 1]\n9. P (l, l\u2032 ) = 1 if and only if l \u2264 l\u2032 .\n10. If l\u2032 \u2264 l\u2032\u2032\u22a5 and l 6= 0, then P (l, l\u2032 \u2228 l\u2032\u2032 ) = P (l, l\u2032 ) + P (l, l\u2032\u2032 ).\n11. We say that a sequence {ln } is convergent to l \u2208 L if P (l\u2032 , ln ) \u2192 P (l\u2032 , l), for all\nl\u2032 \u2208 L \\ {0}. This axiom requires that each increasing sequence is convergent.\n12. Let {ln } \u2286 L. If P (1, ln ) = constant 6= 0, P (ln , lm ) \u2192 1 for n, m \u2192 \u221e and P (l, ln )\nis convergent for each l 6= 0, then {ln } is convergent.\n13. For each \u03b5 > 0 there exists a \u03b4 = \u03b4\u03b5 > 0 such that P (1, l\u2032 ) \u2264 \u03b4 implies\nP (1, l \u2228 l\u2032 ) \u2264 P (1, l) + \u03b5 for all l \u2208 L.\n3\n\n\f14. If l \u2208 L satisfies l\u2032 = (l\u2032 \u2227 l) \u2228 (l\u2032 \u2227 l\u22a5 ) for all l\u2032 \u2208 L, then l = 0 or l = 1. This property\nis called \"irreducibility\".\n15. If T is an (L, \u2264, \u22a5)-automorphism, then it is also a P -automorphism, i.e.\nP (T l, T l\u2032 ) = P (l, l\u2032 ), for all l, l\u2032 \u2208 L, l 6= 0.\n16. If P (1, l) < P (1, l\u2032 ) then there exists an (L, \u2264, \u22a5)-automorphism T such that T l < l\u2032 .\n17. If P (1, l) = P (1, l\u2032 ) then there exists an (L, \u2264, \u22a5)-automorphism T such that T l = l\u2032\nand T l\u2032\u2032 = l\u2032\u2032 for each l\u2032\u2032 \u2264 (l \u2228 l\u2032 )\u22a5 .\n18. There exist l1 < l2 < l3 < l4 .\nIn [vN-H2] von Neumann proved that a continuous geometry with transition\nprobability is isomorphic to the projection lattice of a finite factor (type In or II1 depends\nby the values of the dimension function, whose definition we will recall later).\nIn this paper we obtain the same result in the case In , but without using the transition\nprobability. So we are able to cut off the axioms: 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17. Moreover\nwe will not use axiom 18 and, apparently, axioms 7 (apparently means that one should\nstudy the construction of dimension function deeper in order to see what axioms von\nNeumann used). On the other hand, we have to add two obvious axioms: L must have the\nsame cardinality of R and it must contain at least a minimal element. Actually, we will give\nthis last axiom in a (we hope!) more elegant way, generalizing the well-known property\nof von Neumann algebras: the center of the reduced algebra is the reduced algebra of the\ncenter. But we will use this property only to prove that there exist at least one minimal\nelement.\n\n2\n\nOrthocomplemented lattices\n\nIn this section we recall the original von Neumann's definition of complete lattice (cfr.\n[vN-H1]).\nDefinition 2. A complete lattice is a system (L, \u2264) verifying the following axioms:\n1. \u2264 is a partial ordering on L.\n\n4\n\n\f2. Each subset of L admits a least upper bound and a greatest lower bound. We set\nsup(L) = 1, inf (L) = 0, inf (l, l\u2032 ) = l \u2227 l\u2032 and sup(l, l\u2032 ) = l \u2228 l\u2032 .\n3. \u2228 and \u2227 are continuous in the following sense\n(a) If {li } is an increasing net in L and l \u2208 L, then\n_\n_\n(l \u2227 li ) = l \u2227\nli\ni\n\ni\n\n(b) If {li } is a decreasing net in L and l \u2208 L, then\n^\n^\n(l \u2228 li ) = l \u2228\nli\ni\n\ni\n\n4. The modular property holds\nl \u2264 l\u2032\u2032 \u21d2 (l \u2228 l\u2032 ) \u2227 l\u2032\u2032 = l \u2228 (l\u2032 \u2227 l\u2032\u2032 ) \u2200l\u2032 \u2208 L\nRemark 3. More recently one calls lattice only a partially ordered set in which each\npair of elements admits sup and inf. In particular a lattice is called modular if it verifies\nthe modular property. We work only on modular lattices (unless a little example in\nthe next section) thus we preferred to follow the original von Neumann's definition. On\nthe other hand, it is just the modular property that make false our characterization in\ninfinite dimension: it is proved in [B-vN] that the projections lattice of B(H), with H\ninfinite-dimensional, is not modular.\n\n(see also [Fu]).\n\nIt might be interesting to see\n\nin details what happens without this axiom. We think that our construction can be\ngeneralized (maybe generalizing the dimension function), since it is based above all on\nminimal elements/projections. We will discuss this idea in the last section.\nDefinition 4. An orthocomplemented lattice is a pair (L, \u22a5), where L is a complete lattice\nand\n\n\u22a5\n\n: L \u2192 L is an involution that satisfies\n\n1. l \u2228 l\u22a5 = 1\n2. l \u2227 l\u22a5 = 0\n3. l \u2264 l\u2032 implies l\u2032\u22a5 \u2264 l\u22a5\nWe write also 1 \u2212 l instead of l\u22a5 .\n5\n\n\fNote 5. In the definition of continuous lattice with transition probability, von Neumann\ndoes not require properties 1. and 2. But one can easily prove that they follow by the von\nNeumann's sixth axiom and by the following well-known properties.\n1. (l \u2228 l\u2032 )\u22a5 = l\u22a5 \u2227 l\u2032\u22a5\n2. (l \u2227 l\u2032 )\u22a5 = l\u22a5 \u2228 l\u2032\u22a5\nLet L be an orthocomplemented lattice.\nDefinition 6. Let l \u2208 L. We set \u22a5 (l) = {l\u2032 \u2208 L : l\u2032 \u2264 1 \u2212 l}. Elements belonging into\n\u22a5 (l) are said to be orthogonal to l.\nDefinition 7. Let l, l\u2032 \u2208 L. We said that l commutes with l\u2032 if\nl = (l \u2227 l\u2032 ) \u2228 (l \u2227 l\u2032\u22a5 )\nc(l) will denotes the set of elements which commute with l.\nIt is well-known that\n1. {0, 1, l} \u2286 c(l)\n2. l\u2032 \u2208 c(l) \u21d4 l \u2208 c(l\u2032 )\nThus the relation of commutation is symmetric and we can say that \"l,l' commute\".\nDefinition 8. We set\nC(L) =\n\n\\\n\nc(l)\n\nl\u2208L\n\nElements belonging into C(L) are called central. Certainly C(L) \u2287 {0, 1}. L is called\nfactorial if C(L) = {0, 1}, abelian if C(L) = L.\nNote 9. Factoriality corresponds to irreducibility (14th von Neumann's axiom).\nLemma 10. Let l \u2208 L. Then \u22a5 (l) \u2286 c(l)\nProof. Let l\u2032 \u2264 1 \u2212 l and thus l \u2264 1 \u2212 l\u2032 . We have\n[l \u2227 (1 \u2212 l\u2032 )] \u2228 (l \u2227 l\u2032 ) = l \u2228 0 = l\nthus l\u2032 \u2208 c(l).\n6\n\n\fProposition 11. Let l3 \u2208 c(l1 ) \u2229 c(l2 ), then\n(l1 \u2228 l2 ) \u2227 l3 = (l1 \u2227 l3 ) \u2228 (l2 \u2227 l3 )\nProof. Applying the modular law (sometimes!), one has\n(l1 \u2228 l2 ) \u2227 l3 = [l1 \u2228 (l2 \u2227 l3 ) \u2228 (l2 \u2227 l3\u22a5 )] \u2227 l3 =\n= (l2 \u2227 l3 ) \u2228 [(l1 \u2228 (l2 \u2227 l3\u22a5 )) \u2227 l3 ] =\n= (l2 \u2227 l3 ) \u2228 [((l1 \u2227 l3 ) \u2228 (l1 \u2227 l3\u22a5 ) \u2228 (l2 \u2227 l3\u22a5 )) \u2227 l3 ] =\n= (l2 \u2227 l3 ) \u2228 [(l1 \u2227 l3 ) \u2228 (((l1 \u2227 l3\u22a5 ) \u2228 (l2 \u2227 l3\u22a5 )) \u2227 l3 )] =\n= (l2 \u2227 l3 ) \u2228 (l1 \u2227 l3 )\n\nCorollary 12. An othocomplemented lattice L is abelian if and only if for each l, l\u2032 , l\u2032\u2032 \u2208 L\nthe following holds\n(l \u2228 l\u2032 ) \u2227 l\u2032\u2032 = (l \u2227 l\u2032\u2032 ) \u2228 (l\u2032 \u2227 l\u2032\u2032 )\nThus abelian lattices coincide with those are classically called distributive lattices or Boole\nalgebras.\nProof. If L is abelian, one can apply Prop. 11. Conversely, one can apply the formula\nwith l\u2032 = 1 \u2212 l.\nProposition 13. Let l, l\u2032 \u2208\u22a5 (l). If l \u2228 l\u2032 = l \u2228 l\u2032\u2032 , then l\u2032 = l\u2032\u2032 .\nProof. By Lemma 10 we have l \u2208 c(l\u2032 ) \u2229 c(l\u2032\u2032 ). Thus, using Prop. 11,\nl\u2032\u2032 = (l \u2227 l\u2032\u2032 ) \u2228 (l\u2032\u2032 \u2227 l\u2032\u2032 ) = (l \u2228 l\u2032\u2032 ) \u2227 l\u2032\u2032 =\n= (l \u2228 l\u2032 ) \u2227 l\u2032\u2032 = (l \u2227 l\u2032\u2032 ) \u2228 (l\u2032 \u2227 l\u2032\u2032 ) = l\u2032 \u2227 l\u2032\u2032\nWhence l\u2032\u2032 = l\u2032 \u2227 l\u2032\u2032 and consequently l\u2032\u2032 \u2264 l\u2032 . Changing l\u2032 and l\u2032\u2032 we can find the reverse\ninequality.\n\n7\n\n\fRemark 14. Let l \u2208 L, we consider the complete lattice L\u2032 = L \u2227 l = {l\u2032 \u2227 l, l\u2032 \u2208 L}. This\ncan be orthocomplemented in a natural way setting (for each l\u2032 \u2264 l)\nl \u2212 l\u2032 = (1 \u2212 l\u2032 ) \u2227 l\nNotice that one have to use the modular property to prove that l\u2032 \u2228 (l \u2212 l\u2032 ) = l. Indeed\nl\u2032 \u2228 (l \u2212 l\u2032 ) = l\u2032 \u2228 [(1 \u2212 l\u2032 ) \u2227 l] = [l\u2032 \u2228 (1 \u2212 l\u2032 )] \u2227 l = 1 \u2227 l = l\nDefinition 15. An element l \u2208 L is called abelian if L \u2227 l is an abelian lattice. Let Ab(L)\nbe the set of abelian element in L.\nRemark 16. Obviously a Boole algebra can be characterized as a lattice for which\nAb(L) = L.\nDefinition 17. A factorial lattice is said \"of type I\" if it admits at least a non-zero abelian\nelement.\nRemark 18. By definition of orthocomplement in L\u2227l, it follows that C(L)\u2227l \u2286 C(L\u2227l).\nThe reverse inclusion holds for Boole algebras and it could hold for other important classes\nof orthocomplemented lattices.\nDefinition 19. An R-lattice is an orthocomplemented lattice in which the following\nproperty of restriction of the central elements holds\nC(L \u2227 l) = C(L) \u2227 l \u2200l \u2208 L\nWe repeat that this property generalized the well-known property of von Neumann\nalgebras: the center of the reduced algebra is the reduced algebra of the center.\nProblem 20. Do there exist orthocomplemented lattices which are not R-lattices? also\namong the factorial ones?\nWe conclude this preliminary section giving a nice characterization of the orthogonal\ncomplement. We recall the following\nDefinition 21. Let l \u2208 L. An inverse of l is an element l\u2032 \u2208 L such that l\u2032 \u2228 l = 1 e\nl \u2227 l = 0. inv(l) will denote the set of the inverse of l.\n8\n\n\fProposition 22. Let l \u2208 L. One has\nc(l) \u2229 inv(l) = {1 \u2212 l}\nProof. Certainly 1 \u2212 l \u2208 c(l) \u2229 inv(l). Now let x \u2208 c(l) \u2229 inv(l), then\nx = (x \u2227 l) \u2228 (x \u2227 (1 \u2212 l)) = x \u2227 (1 \u2212 l)\nthus x \u2264 1 \u2212 l. Now we assume that x 6= 1 \u2212 l, then 1 \u2212 l \u2212 x is defined and not zero. Now\nwe observe that if l, l\u2032 are two elements in L and l\u2032 \u2264 l, we defined l \u2212 l\u2032 = l \u2227 (1 \u2212 l\u2032 ). Now\nwe have 1 \u2212 l\u2032 \u2264 l and thus\nl \u2212 (1 \u2212 l\u2032 ) = l \u2227 (1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 l\u2032 )) = l \u2227 l\u2032\nApplying this observation with l = 1 \u2212 l and l\u2032 = 1 \u2212 x we have\n1 \u2212 l \u2228 x = (1 \u2212 l) \u2227 (1 \u2212 x) = 1 \u2212 l \u2212 x 6= 0\nant thus the absurd: l \u2228 x 6= 1.\nDefinition 23. l, l\u2032 \u2208 L are said to be independent if l \u2227 l\u2032 = 0.\nRemark 24. To prove the implication x \u2208 c(l) \u2229 inv(l) \u21d2 x \u2264 1 \u2212 l we used only the\nindependence between l and l\u2032 . Thus we can interpret 1 \u2212 l as the sup of elements which\nare independents and commuting with l .\n\n3\n\nSome examples\n\nIn this section we give some examples of othocomplemented lattices.\n1. For each set X, the set of its subsets P (X) is a Boolean algebra. It is well-known\n(see [Bi]) that each finite Boolean algebra can be obtained in this way. The Stone\nrepresentation theorem (see [St] or [Jo]) give the following deep characterization:\neach Boolean algebra is isomorphic to the set of clopen subsets (subsets which are\nopen and closed) of an Hausdorff extremely disconnected topological space.\n2. The projections lattice of a von Neumann algebra is always an infinite\northocomplemented lattice. It is abelian (resp. factorial) if and only if the von\nNeumann algebra is abelian (resp. a factor).\n9\n\n\f3. Let n \u2208 N. If n is odd, there are no orthocomplemented lattices with n elements. On\nthe other hand, if n is even, and equal to 2m, it is possible to construct a factorial\nlattice with n elements. Indeed we set\nLm = {0, l1 , 1 \u2212 l1 , l2 , 1 \u2212 l2 , ...lm , 1 \u2212 lm }\nwith the conditions l \u2227 l\u2032 = 0, l \u2228 l\u2032 = 1 for each l 6= l\u2032 .

Indeed one can define (in a\nobvious way) the algebraic product of a finite family of orthocomplemented lattices\nwith the lexicographic order and setting (l1 , ...ln )\u22a5 = (l1\u22a5 , ...ln\u22a5 ). Chevalier proved\nthat each finite orthocomplemented lattice is product of {0, 1}n with a finite family\nof type Lm lattices. (see also [Sv]).\n4.

Indeed it is clearly an orthocomplemented lattice, in\nthe sense that it satisfies the first three property of the definition of lattice and all\nthose of the definition of the orthocomplementation. But it is not modular (you find\nwith {x, 1 \u2212 x, x \u2228 y}). Moreover, a direct calculation shows that C(L) = L. On the\nother hand it is not distributive (otherwise it should be modular!). Notice that, in\norder to obtain the equivalence in Cor.12, we used the modular property to prove\nProp. 11. More generally the following proposition holds\nProposition 25. Let L be an orthocomplemented non-modular lattice.\nconsiders the following three properties\n11\n\nOne\n\n\f(a) L is modular.\n(b) L is abelian.\n(c) L is distributive.\nThen c) \u21d4 a) \u2227 b). That is: the third property holds if and only if both the other two\nhold.\nProblem 26. What is the smallest example of orthocomplemented lattice which is\nneither abelian nor factorial?\nNotice that the previous one is not the smallest example of orthocomplemented\nlattice which is abelian without being distributive. The hexagon is a much more\ntrivial example!\n\n4\n\nEquivalence relations on orthocomplemented lattices\n\nIn [vN-H1] von Neumann showed that a powerful mean to know the structure of an\northocomplemented lattice is given by its equivalence relations. In the next three sections\nwe want to run again the street opened by von Neumann, abstracting some concepts.\nDefinition 27. Let L be a lattice and \u223c an equivalence relation on L. We say that l \u2208 L\nis \u223cdominated by l\u2032 \u2208 L (and we write l \u2264\u223c l\u2032 ) if and only if there exists l\u2032\u2032 \u2264 l\u2032 such that\nl\u2032\u2032 \u223c l\u2032 . We write l <\u223c l\u2032 if l\u2032\u2032 < l\u2032 .\nObviously one is interested to equivalence relation that are compatible with the\nordering in some sense.\nDefinition 28. An equivalence relation on an orthocomplemented lattice is called regular\nif\n1. l \u223c 0 \u21d4 l = 0\n2. l \u2265 l\u2032 and l \u2264\u223c l\u2032 imply l \u223c l\u2032 (order compatibility)\n3. For each l, l\u2032 \u2208 L one and only one of the followings hold l \u223c l\u2032 , l \u2264\u223c l\u2032 , l\u2032 \u2264\u223c l.\n\n12\n\n\f4. If {li } and {li\u2032 } are two families of mutually orthogonal elements and they are such\nthat li \u223c li\u2032 for each i, then\n\n_\n\nli \u223c\n\ni\n\n_\n\nli\u2032\n\ni\n\n5. Conditions l\u2032 \u2264 l, l\u2032 \u223c l imply l\u2032 = l (finiteness property).\nDefinition 29. A complete lattice is called irreducible if only 0 and 1 have unique inverse\n(see Def.21)\nRemark 30. We recall that irreducibility corresponds (in orthocomplemented lattices)\nto factoriality (see. [vN-H2], pg. 14).\nWe can join some von Neumann's results to obtain the following\nTheorem 31. (von Neumann) Let L be a complete irreducible lattice. Setting l \u223c l\u2032\nif and only if they are a common inverse (see Def.21), then \u223c is a regular equivalence\nrelation on L.\nProof. Properties 2,3,4 e 5 are already proved by von Neumann in [vN-H1]. The first one\nis clear: if l \u223c 0, then l, 0 have a common inverse. But the unique inverse of 0 is 1 and\nthus l = 1 \u2227 l = 0.\nDefinition 32. We say that two elements are perspective if they are a common inverse.\nThus each irreducible complete lattice (and in particular each orthocomplemented\nfactorial lattice) admits a regular equivalence relation. In this case one can ask if this\nrelation is also compatible with the orthogonality in some sense. Property 4. is already\na compatibility with the orthogonality, but we will prove something more: there exists\nsubstantially only one regular relation (which coincide with the perspective relation,\ni.e.\n\nwith the Murray-von Neumann relation on projections) and thus it verifies the\n\nparallelogram law: l \u2228 l\u2032 \u2212 l \u223c l\u2032 \u2212 l \u2227 l\u2032 .\n\nProposition 33. Let \u223c be a regular equivalence relation on L. If l \u223c l\u2032 and l1 \u2264 l, then\nl1 \u2264\u223c l\u2032 .\n\n13\n\n\fProof. By definition one has l1 \u2264\u223c l\u2032 or l\u2032 \u2264\u223c l1 . We assume the last one and we prove\nthat actually the first one holds in the form: l1 \u223c l\u2032 . Indeed l \u223c l\u2032 \u2264\u223c l1 and thus,\nby transitivity, l \u2264\u223c l1 . On the other hand, by hypothesis, l1 \u2264 l and thus, by order\ncompatibility, it follows that l1 \u223c l and thus l1 \u223c l\u2032 .\n\n5\n\nMinimal elements in factorial lattices\n\nLet L be a factorial R-lattice and \u223c be a regular equivalence relation on L. We recall the\nproperty R: C(L) \u2227 l = C(L \u2227 l) for each l \u2208 L. We don't know if there exists factorial\nlattices which do not verify it.\nDefinition 34. A non-zero element l \u2208 L is called minimal if for each l\u2032 \u2208 L one and only\none of the following holds: l \u2227 l\u2032 = 0, or l \u2227 l\u2032 = l. Let M in(L) denote the set of minimal\nelements of L and with M in(l) the set of minimal elements of L which are less then l.\nNote 35. In literature minimal elements are also called atoms. We prefer to call them\nminimal for keeping a sense of continuously with the theory of Operator Algebras.\nCorollary 36. If l is minimal and l\u2032 \u223c l, than also l\u2032 is minimal.\nProof. Let l1\u2032 \u2264 l\u2032 and thus (by Prop.33) l1\u2032 \u2264\u223c l and consequently l1\u2032 \u223c 0, or l1\u2032 \u223c l. The\nproperties of \u223c then guarantee l1\u2032 = 0, or, by finiteness, l1\u2032 = l\u2032 .\nHere is one of the main result to develop our approach.\nProposition 37. Let L be a type I factorial lattice. Each element of L contains a minimal\nelement.\nProof. Let l 6= 0, l \u2208 Ab(L). Factoriality and property R imply {0, l} = C(L)\u2227l = C(L\u2227l);\nand thus L \u2227 l is still factorial. Since it is also abelian, it must be L \u2227 l = {0, l}. Thus l is\nminimal. Now let l\u2032 \u2208 L. It must be l\u2032 \u2264\u223c l, or l \u2264\u223c l\u2032 . In the first case l\u2032 \u223c l1 \u2264 l. Thus\nl\u2032 \u223c 0 (and therefore l\u2032 = 0), or l\u2032 \u223c l (and therefore l\u2032 is minimal, by Cor.36). In the\nsecond one l\u2032 contains an element equivalent to l. This element must be minimal, being l\nminimal (still by Cor.36).\n\n14\n\n\fCorollary 38. Let L be a type I factorial lattice and {li } a family of elements which are\nW\nmaximal in the properties to be minimal and mutually orthogonal. Then i li = 1.\nProof. If l = 1\u2212\n\nW\n\ni li\n\n6= 0, we can find (see Prop.37) a minimal element l1 \u2264 l, contradicting\n\nmaximality.\nCorollary 39. Let L be a type I factorial lattice. Each element of L is sup of a family of\nminimal and mutually orthogonal elements.\n\n6\n\nThe dimension function\n\nIn this section we give a sketch of the construction of the dimension function in an\nirreducible complete lattice.\nDefinition 40. A system {li }i\u2208I of elements in L is called independent if for each partition\n{J, K} of I one has\n\n_\n\nli \u2227\n\ni\u2208J\n\n_\n\nli = 0\n\ni\u2208K\n\nNote 41. In this section one can change the word \"independent\" with \"orthogonal\".\nTh.31 is still valid.\nDefinition 42. Let L be a complete lattice and \u223c a regular equivalence relation on L. A\ndimension function \u223c-compatible is a map D : L \u2192 [0, 1] such that\n1. D(0) = 0, D(1) = 1\n2. D(l \u2228 l\u2032 ) + D(l \u2227 l\u2032 ) = D(l) + D(l\u2032 )\n3. D(l) = D(l\u2032 ) \u21d4 l \u223c l\u2032\n4. D(l) \u2264 D(l\u2032 ) \u21d4 l \u2264\u223c l\u2032\n5. If {li } is a finite or countable independent system, then\n_\nX\nD( li ) =\nD(li )\n\n15\n\n\fVon Neumann proved in [vN-H1] that choosing \u223c as the perspective equivalence\nrelation, then there exists a unique dimension function \u223c-compatible. Moreover the image\nD(L) can be only one among the following sets\n1. \u2206n = {0, n1 , n2 , ... n\u22121\nn , 1}\n2. \u2206\u221e = [0, 1]\nHere we give a sketch of the construction of the dimension function. The complete\nconstruction can be founded in the first five chapters of [vN-H1]. Let us precise that\nthis construction also works in our case (factorial R-lattices), since factoriality and\nirreducibility coincide for orthocomplemented lattices.\n(I step)\nSince we want define a class function (i.e. constant on each equivalence class) which\ndescribes the order of the equivalence class through the order of their values, the first step\nconsists of defining some operations between equivalence classes. More precisely, we set\nL = L/ \u223c and we denote A, B, C... the elements of L. Von Neumann himself proved that\nif there exist a \u2208 A, b \u2208 B such that a \u2227 b = 0 then one can well-define a unique class\nA \u2228 B (that is the class containing a \u2228 b). Analogously , if there exist a \u2208 A, b \u2208 B such\nthat a \u2265 b, one can well-define a unique class A \u2212 B (that is the class containing a \u2212 b).\n(II step)\nAfter proving some algebraic properties of the operations between classes, von Neumann\ngave the following crucial\nDefinition 43. Let A0 be the class containing 0 \u2208 L and A \u2208 L. We set 0A = A0 .\nNow, supposing defined (n \u2212 1)A and that there exists (n \u2212 1)A \u2228 A, than we define\nnA = (n \u2212 1)A \u2228 A. Otherwise nA is not defined.\nIn order to understand the idea of this definition, it is better to think at factorial\nR-lattices of type I. In this case we know that each element is sup of a family of minimal\nelements. Now we assume the following fact (that we will prove later)\nTheorem 44. Let L be a factorial R-lattice of type I and {li }i\u2208I , {lj\u2032 }j\u2208J two families of\nmutually orthogonal and minimal elements. Then\n16\n\n\f1. |I| and |J| are finite numbers.\n2.\n\nW\n\ni li\n\n\u223c\n\nW\n\n\u2032\nj lj\n\nif and only if |I| = |J|.\n\nLet A \u2208 L. Thanks to this theorem we can define m1 as the number of minimal\nelements appearing in some decomposition of 1 \u2208 L and mA as the number of minimal\nelements appearing in some decomposition of a \u2208 A. Let Amin be the class containing\neach minimal element of L and let nA be the greatest integer for which nA is defined.\nIn this case von Neumann's idea is to determine m1 as nAmin (indeed nAmin \u2228 Amin is\ndefined until one takes a maximal family of minimal and mutually orthogonal elements),\nthen to determine nA = nAmin \u2212 mA and lastly to define the dimension of the class A as\nmA /nAmin . One can follow this idea also in more general cases: the key is to understand\nwhat means, given two classes A and B: n is the greatest integer for which nA is into B.\nDefinition 45. Let A, B \u2208 L. We set A < B if and only if there exist a \u2208 A, b \u2208 B such\nthat a <\u223c b.\nNow we can enunciate one of the most important theorem of this theory.\nTheorem 46. Let A0 6= A, B \u2208 L. There exist a unique pair (n, B1 ), where n \u2265 0 is an\ninteger and B1 < A is a class such that\nB = nA + B1\nWe set [B : A] = n.\nNow the construction would be concluded in the case of factorial lattices of type I. In\nthe general case in which we have not minimal elements, we need a further step.\n(III step)\nDefinition 47. A class A0 6= A \u2208 L is said to be minimal if there no exists B 6= A0 such\nthat B < A.\nThe case in which A is not minimal is optimally described by von Neumann with the\nfollowing\nTheorem 48. If A is not minimal, then there exist B 6= A0 such that 2B \u2264 A.\n17\n\n\fDefinition 49. A minimal sequence {An } of elements 6= A0 is one containing but one\nelement B which is minimal, or containing a denumerable infinitude of elements such that\n2An+1 \u2264 An .\nUsing th.48 we have the existence of minimal sequence. The following theorem allows\nto define the dimension function.\nTheorem 50. Let A0 6= A \u2208 L. Then the following limit exists and it is finite and positive\n(A : A1 ) = limi\u2192\u221e\n\n[A : Ai ]\n[A1 : Ai ]\n\nwhere A1 denotes the class in which 1 \u2208 L belong. (If {Ai } consists of one minimal element\nB, we mean by limi\u2192\u221e the value at Ai = B.).\n(IV step)\nDefinition 51. Let l \u2208 L and Al be the class containing l. We set D(l) = (Al : A1 ) if\nl 6= 0. Otherwise D(0) = 0.\nThe dimension function verifies the following properties.\n1. D(l) \u2208 [0, 1] for each l \u2208 L. D(0) = 0, D(1) = 1\n2. D(l \u2228 l\u2032 ) + D(l \u2227 l\u2032 ) = D(l) + D(l\u2032 )\n3. D(l) = D(l\u2032 ) \u21d4 l \u223c l\u2032\n4. D(l) \u2264 D(l\u2032 ) \u21d4 l \u2264\u223c l\u2032\n5. if {li } \u00e8 is a finite or countable independent system, then\n_\nX\nD( li ) =\nD(li )\n6. D(L) \u00e8 is one of the following sets\n(a) \u2206n = {0, n1 , n2 , ... n\u22121\nn , 1}\n(b) \u2206\u221e = [0, 1]\n\n18\n\n\fWe conclude this section proving some easy facts descending by von Neumann\nconstruction. Let, for the rest of the section, L be a factorial R-lattice. At first we\ngive the following\nDefinition 52. L is said of type In if it admits a dimension function D such that\nD(L) = \u2206n . It is said to be of type II1 if it admits a dimension function D such that\nD(L) = \u2206\u221e .\nRemark 53. An easy consequence of the correspondence theorem (see th.70) is that the\nnotion of type do not depend by the choice of the \u223cdimensionable equivalence relation.\nRemark 54. Notation In agree with the locution \"of type I\". Indeed, by the following\nprop.56 it follows that a factorial R-lattice is of type In (for some n) if and only if it is of\ntype I.\nDefinition 55. A reference on L is given by the choice of a maximal family with respect\nto the properties: mutually orthogonal and minimal.\nProposition 56. Let L of type In . Then\n1. l \u2208 M in(L) if and only if D(l) =\n\n1\nn\n\n2. if R is a reference on L, then |R| = n.\nProof.\n\n1. Let l \u2208 M in(l). If it were D(l) = 0, it would be l \u223c 0 and thus l = 0. Instead,\n\nif it were D(l) = m/n, with m > 1, one could consider l\u2032 \u2208 L such that D(l\u2032 ) = 1/n.\nWhence 0 6= l\u2032 \u2264\u223c l and thus l could not be minimal. Conversely it is clear using\nthe finiteness property of minimal elements.\n2. We suppose for example |R| = m > n (the other case is just the same). Let\nl1 , ...lm \u2208 R. We obtain the following absurd\n1 = D(1) \u2265 D(l1 \u2228 ... \u2228 lm ) =\n\nm\nX\ni=1\n\nNow we can prove th.44.\n19\n\nD(li ) =\n\nm\nX\ni=1\n\n1/n = m/n > 1\n\n\fProof.\n\n1. Using Prop.56, we have |I|, |J| \u2264 n.\n\n2. If |I| = |J| then l =\n\nW\n\ni li\n\n\u223c\n\nW\n\n\u2032\nj lj\n\n= l\u2032 since \u223c is regular. Conversely, we assume for\n\nexample that |I| \u2264 |J|, then there exists J \u2032 \u2286 J such that |I| = |J \u2032 | and thus, by the\nW\nW\nregularity of \u223c, we have i\u2208I li \u223c j\u2208J \u2032 lj\u2032 = l1\u2032 . Whence l1\u2032 \u2264 l\u2032 and l1\u2032 \u223c l\u2032 . By the\nfiniteness property it follows that l1\u2032 = l\u2032 and thus, since lj\u2032 are mutually orthogonal,\n|J| = |J \u2032 |.\n\n7\n\nFactorial W \u2217-lattices of type In\n\nSince we want axiomatize the projection lattice of Mn (C), we are interested in the case\nin which the lattice contains infinite non-countable elements. This property does not hold\nin generale, since one can easily construct finite factorial lattices for example of type I2 :\nL = {0, x, 1 \u2212 x, y, 1 \u2212 y, 1} in which x, 1 \u2212 x, 1 \u2212 y, y have dimension 1/2. Thus they are\nminimals and consequently x (resp. y) commutes only with 0, x, 1\u2212x, 1 (resp. 0, y, 1\u2212y, 1).\nWhence L is factorial.\nDefinition 57. A factorial W \u2217 -lattice of type In is a factorial R-lattice of type In that\ncontains infinite non-countable elements.\n\n8\n\nGeometry of minimal elements\n\nLet L be a factorial W \u2217 -lattice of type In . We start proving that also M in(L) has the\nsame cardinality of L.\nProposition 58.\n|M in(L)| = |R|\nProof. It follows by Cor.39 and Th.44 that each element of L is sup of a finite family\nof minimal elements. Thus L has the same cardinality of the set of the finite subsets of\nM in(L), which has the same cardinality of M in(L).\n\n20\n\n\fDefinition 59. Let A be a set, a0 \u2208 A and A\u2032 \u2286 A \u00d7 A. We say that A\u2032 is a0 -rightseparated if (A \u00d7 {a0 }) \u2229 A\u2032 = \u2205.\nLemma 60. Let A, B be two equipotent sets, A\u2032 \u2286 A, B \u2032 \u2286 B be also equipotent,\nA\u2032\u2032 \u2286 A \u00d7 A a0 -right-separated and equipotent to the b0 -right-separated set B \u2032\u2032 \u2286 B \u00d7 B.\nThen there exists a bijection \u03a8 : A \u2192 B such that\n1. \u03a8|A\u2032 : A\u2032 \u2192 B \u2032 is a bijection\n2. (a1 , a2 ) \u2208 A\u2032\u2032 \u21d4 (\u03a8(a1 ), \u03a8(a2 )) \u2208 B \u2032\u2032\nProof. Let us consider the following subsets of A \u00d7 A: A1 = A\u2032 \u00d7 {a0 }, A2 = (A\\A\u2032 ) \u00d7\n{a0 }, A3 = A\u2032\u2032 , A4 = (A \u00d7 A)\\(A\u2032\u2032 \u222a A \u00d7 {a0 }). They are a partition of A \u00d7 A and\nthey are respectively equipotent to B1 = B \u2032 \u00d7 {b0 }, B2 = (B\\B \u2032 ) \u00d7 {b0 }, B3 = B \u2032\u2032 , B4 =\n(B \u00d7 B)\\(B \u2032\u2032 \u222a B \u00d7 {b0 }), which is a partition of B \u00d7 B. Thus there exist bijections\n\u03c81 : A1 \u2192 B1 , \u03c82 : A2 \u2192 B2 , \u03c83 : A3 \u2192 B3 and \u03c84 : A4 \u2192 B4 . Now we can join all these\nmaps to obtain a bijection \u03a81 : A \u00d7 A \u2192 B \u00d7 B, which, restricted to A \u00d7 {a0 }, gives a\nbijection between it (and thus between A) and B \u00d7 {b0 } (and thus with B) that satisfies\nthe required properties.\nIt follows an unexpected and decisive result.\nDefinition 61. Let I be a set and l2 (I) the standard Hilbert space on I. Let l2 (I)1 be\nthe unit sphere of l2 (I), that is\nl2 (I)1 = {x \u2208 l2 (I) : ||x|| = 1}\nWe define the following equivalence relation on l2 (I)1 : xEy \u21d4 \u2203\u03b8 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0) : x = ei\u03b8 y, in\nwhich transitivity follows by summing \u03b8 modulo 2\u03c0.\nTheorem 62. Let L be a factorial W \u2217 -lattice of type In on which a reference R =\n{r1 , ...rn } is fixed. Then there exists a bijection \u03a8 : M in(L) \u2192 l2 (R)1 /E such that\n1. \u03a8(ri ) is the i-th element of the canonical orthonormal basis of the Hilbert space l2 (R).\n2. m \u22a5 n \u21d4 \u03a8(m) \u22a5 \u03a8(n) in the Hilbert space l2 (R).\n\n21\n\n\fProof. Let A = M in(L) \u222a {1} \u2286 L, A\u2032 = R, A\u2032\u2032 = {(m, n) \u2208 A \u00d7 A : m \u22a5 n}, B =\nl2 (R)1 /E \u222a {1} \u2286 B(l2 (R)), B \u2032 =\"canonical orthonormal basis of l2 (R)\", B \u2032\u2032 = {(x, y) \u2208\nB \u00d7 B : x \u22a5 y}. It is enough to prove that those sets satisfy the hypothesis of lemma\n60 and that \u03a8(1) = 1. In this case we can restrict \u03a8 and obtain a bijection \u03a8 : A \u2192 B\nwithout modifying its properties. Certainly A\u2032\u2032 and B \u2032\u2032 are 1-right-separated. Now, since\nR is finite, then l2 (R)1 has the same cardinality of R, that is the same cardinality of A\n(by Prop.58). Moreover A\u2032 is equipotent to B \u2032 since each basis of l2 (R) has the same\ncardinality of R and thus the same cardinality of A\u2032 . Lastly A\u2032\u2032 is equipotent to A and B \u2032\u2032\nis equipotent to B and thus A is equipotent to B. It remains to prove that \u03a8(1) = 1: it\nis sufficient to observe that in the proof of lemma 60 one can always choose \u03c81 such that\n\u03c81 (a0 , a0 ) = (b0 , b0 ).\nAfter this fundamental result we prove some easy lemmas on the behavior of the\nminimal elements. Also these lemmas will be crucial in the proof of the correspondence\ntheorem.\nLemma 63. For each l \u2208 L, one has\n\nW\n\nm\u2208M in(l) m\n\n= l.\n\nW\nProof. Since m \u2264 l for each m \u2208 M in(l), one certainly has m\u2208M in(l) m \u2264 l. Conversely, if\nW\nW\nl\u2212 m\u2208M in(l) m 6= 0, then there exists m\u2032 \u2208 M in(l\u2212 m\u2208M in(l) m). This is a contradiction,\nbecause we have already get all the minimal elements dominated by l.\nLemma 64. Let l, l\u2032 \u2208 L. Then l \u2264 l\u2032 if and only if M in(l) \u2286 M in(l\u2032 ).\nProof. If l \u2264 l\u2032 and m \u2208 M in(l) one certainly has m \u2208 M in(l\u2032 ). Conversely, using lemma\n63, one has\nl=\n\n_\nm\u2208M in(l)\n\n_\n\nm\u2264\n\nm = l\u2032\n\nm\u2208M in(l\u2032 )\n\nLemma 65. Let l, l\u2032 \u2208 L. Then \u22a5 (l \u2228 l\u2032 ) \u2286\u22a5 (l)\u2229 \u22a5 (l\u2032 ).\nProof. Let x \u2208\u22a5 (l \u2228 l\u2032 ), then, by definition, x \u2264 1 \u2212 (l \u2228 l\u2032 ). Now, we know that l, l\u2032 \u2264 l \u2228 l\u2032\nand thus 1 \u2212 l \u2228 l\u2032 \u2264 1 \u2212 l, 1 \u2212 l\u2032 . So x \u2264 1 \u2212 l, 1 \u2212 l\u2032 and x \u2208\u22a5 (l)\u2229 \u22a5 (l\u2032 ).\n\n22\n\n\fLemma 66. Let l, l\u2032 \u2208 L. Then\nM in(l \u2228 l\u2032 )\u2229 \u22a5 (l)\u2229 \u22a5 (l\u2032 ) = \u2205\nProof. Let x \u2208\u22a5 (l)\u2229 \u22a5 (l\u2032 ), then x \u2264 1 \u2212 l, 1 \u2212 l\u2032 . Consequently x \u2264 (1 \u2212 l) \u2227 (1 \u2212 l\u2032 ) =\n1 \u2212 (l \u2228 l\u2032 ). So x \u2208\u22a5 (l \u2228 l\u2032 ) and thus it can not be dominated by l \u2228 l\u2032 .\nLemma 67. Let m, n \u2208 M in(L). Then m \u223c n.\nProof. It must be m \u2264\u223c n or n \u2264\u223c m. Since each non zero element is not equivalent to 0\nand since m, n are minimal, the it must be exactly m \u223c n.\nLemma 68. For each l\u2032 \u2264 l, one has M in(l \u2212 l\u2032 ) = M in(l)\u2229 \u22a5 (l\u2032 ).\nProof. If x \u2208 M in(l \u2212 l\u2032 ) one certainly has x \u2208 M in(l). Moreover x \u2264 l \u2212 l\u2032 \u2264 1 \u2212 l\u2032 and\nthus x \u2208\u22a5 (l\u2032 ). Conversely, if x \u2208 M in(l)\u2229 \u22a5 (l\u2032 ), then x \u2264 1 \u2212 l\u2032 is minimal. But x \u2264 l\nand thus x \u2264 (1 \u2212 l\u2032 ) \u2227 l = l \u2212 l\u2032 is minimal.\n\n9\n\nThe correspondence theorem\n\nIn this section we finally prove that the concept of factorial W \u2217 -lattice of type In\naxiomatizes the projection lattice of Mn (C).\nNotation 69. Pn will denote the projection lattice of B(Mn (C)).\nTheorem 70. The map Mn (C) \u2192 Pn sends type In factors in factorial W \u2217 -lattices of\ntype In . Conversely, if L is a factorial W \u2217 -lattice of type In , then L \u223c\n= Pn .\nProof. Of course Pn is a factorial W \u2217 -lattice of type In , using the normalized trace as\ndimension. Conversely, let {li }ni=1 be a reference on L and we set H = l2 (I). We map li\nin the projection eli of H onto the i-th addend of the direct sum H = Cn . Now, if l \u2208 L\nis minimal, we map it in the projection of H onto \u03a8(l)C. Now, if l \u2208 L, we can write\nW\nl = lj (where the lj are minimal and mutually orthogonal). Since all the \u03a8(lj ) are still\nminimal and mutually orthogonal in Mn (C), we can map l in the projection el of H onto\nL\nj\u2208J \u03a8(lj )C. In this way, we have constructed a map from L into Pn . Now, if e \u2208 Pn ,\n\n23\n\n\fwe write eH as direct sum of one-dimensional subspaces and then observe that each onedimensional subspace is of the form aC (for a unique a \u2208 l2 (I)1 /E). So, recalling that \u03a8\nW\nis a bijection, we have that eH comes from \u03a8\u22121 (a), where a runs over a decomposition\nof eH. Thus we have a bijection between L and Pn . Now we have to prove that they\nare the same lattice structure. Let \u03a8 : L \u2192 P (B(H)) be the bijection we have already\nconstructed. We have to prove the following properties:\n1. \u03a8 preserves the lattice structure. That is\n(a) \u03a8(l) \u2264 \u03a8(l\u2032 ) \u21d4 l \u2264 l\u2032\n(b) \u03a8(l \u2227 l\u2032 ) = \u03a8(l) \u2227 \u03a8(l\u2032 )\n(c) \u03a8(l \u2228 l\u2032 ) = \u03a8(l) \u2228 \u03a8(l\u2032 )\n2. \u03a8 preserves the orthocomplementation. That is\n\u03a8(1 \u2212 l) = \u03a8(1) \u2212 \u03a8(l)\n3. \u03a8 preserves the regular equivalence relation. That is\n\u03a8(l) \u223c \u03a8(l\u2032 ) \u21d4 l \u223c l\u2032\nIn this case \u03a8 would automatically preserve the dimension.\nWe recall that the map \u03a8|M in(L) is a bijection between M in(L) and M in(Pn ) (by\nconstruction).\n1. (a) Let l \u2264 l\u2032 and \u03a8(m) \u2208 M in(\u03a8(l)).\n\nThen m \u2208 M in(l) \u2286 M in(l\u2032 ) and\n\nthus \u03a8(m) \u2208 M in(\u03a8(l\u2032 ). Consequently, we have M in(\u03a8(l)) \u2286 M in(\u03a8(l\u2032 ))\nand, by lemma 64, \u03a8(l) \u2264 \u03a8(l\u2032 ).\n\nConversely, if \u03a8(l) \u2264 \u03a8(l\u2032 ), then\n\nM in(\u03a8(l)) \u2286 M in(\u03a8(l\u2032 )). Thus if m \u2208 M in(l), then \u03c8(m) \u2208 M in(\u03a8(l))\nand \u03c8(m) \u2208 M in(\u03a8(l\u2032 )). Consequently m \u2208 M in(l\u2032 ). So we have obtained\nM in(l) \u2286 M in(l\u2032 ) and then l \u2264 l\u2032 (always using lemma 64).\n(b) Let \u03a8(m) \u2208 M in(Pn ). We have\n\u03a8(m) \u2264 \u03a8(l \u2227 l\u2032 ) \u21d4 m \u2264 l \u2227 l\u2032 \u21d4 m \u2264 l, l\u2032 \u21d4 \u03a8(m) \u2264 \u03a8(l), \u03a8(l\u2032 ) \u21d4\n\u21d4 \u03a8(m) \u2264 \u03a8(l) \u2227 \u03a8(l\u2032 )\n24\n\n\fSo \u03a8(l \u2227 l\u2032 ) and \u03a8(l) \u2227 \u03a8(l\u2032 ) have the same minimal elements. Whence they are\nequals, using lemma 64 again.\n(c) Certainly l, l\u2032 \u2264 l\u2228l\u2032 . Thus \u03a8(l), \u03a8(l\u2032 ) \u2264 \u03a8(l\u2228l\u2032 ) and consequently \u03a8(l)\u2228\u03a8(l\u2032 ) \u2264\n\u03a8(l \u2228 l\u2032 ). Conversely, let \u03a8(m) \u2208 M in(\u03a8(l \u2228 l\u2032 ) \u2212 \u03a8(l) \u2228 \u03a8(l\u2032 )), then\n\u03a8(m) \u2208 M in(\u03a8(l \u2228 l\u2032 ))\u2229 \u22a5 (\u03a8(l) \u2228 \u03a8(l\u2032 )) \u2286\nusing lemma 65\n\u2286 M in(\u03a8(l \u2228 l\u2032 ))\u2229 \u22a5 (\u03a8(l))\u2229 \u22a5 (\u03a8(l\u2032 ))\nWhence\nm \u2208 M in(l \u2228 l\u2032 )\u2229 \u22a5 (l)\u2229 \u22a5 (l\u2032 ) = \u2205 (by 66)\nThat is absurd. Consequenlty \u03a8(l \u2228 l\u2032 ) \u2212 \u03a8(l) \u2228 \u03a8(l\u2032 )) does not contain minimal\nelements and thus it must be zero.\n2. One has\n\u03a8(m) \u2208 M in(\u03a8(1 \u2212 l)) \u21d4 m \u2208 M in(1 \u2212 l) \u21d4 m \u2208 M in(1)\u2229 \u22a5 (l) \u21d4\n\u21d4 \u03a8(m) \u2208 M in(\u03a8(1))\u2229 \u22a5 (\u03a8(l)) \u21d4 \u03a8(m) \u2208 M in(\u03a8(1) \u2212 \u03a8(l))\nThus \u03a8(1 \u2212 l) and \u03a8(1) \u2212 \u03a8(l) have the same minimal elements and thus they are\nequals.\n3. It remains to prove that \u03a8 preserves the regular equivalence relation. Let \u223cL be\nthe equivalence relation on L and let \u223cPn be the equivalence relation on Pn . We\nW\nhave to prove that l \u223cL l\u2032 \u21d4 \u03a8(l) \u223cPn \u03a8(l\u2032 ). Let l \u223cL l\u2032 , we write l = i\u2208I li e\nW\nl\u2032 = i\u2208I li\u2032 , where {li } and {li\u2032 } are two maximal families of mutually orthogonal and\nminimal elements dominated respectively by l and l\u2032 . Since li and li\u2032 are minimal,\nit must be li \u223cL li\u2032 and thus, since \u03a8 preserves minimality, \u03a8(li ) \u223cPn \u03a8(li\u2032 ) for each\ni. Now, since \u03a8 preserves minimality, orthogonality and order, {\u03a8(li )} and {\u03a8(li\u2032 )}\nare two maximal families of minimal projections of Mn (C) dominated respectively\nby \u03a8(l) and \u03a8(l\u2032 ). This means that \u03a8(l) and \u03a8(l\u2032 ) project onto two subspaces of\nthe same dimension and thus they are equivalent. Conversely, we assume that \u03a8(l)\nand \u03a8(l\u2032 ) are equivalent and thus that they project onto subspaces of the same\n25\n\n\fdimension. We decompose these two subspaces in one-dimensional and mutually\nW\nW\northogonal subspaces and so we write \u03a8(l) = i\u2208I \u03a8(li ) and \u03a8(l\u2032 ) = i\u2208I \u03a8(li\u2032 ),\nwhere {li } and {li\u2032 } are two maximal families of minimal and mutually orthogonal\nelements dominated respectively by l and l\u2032 . Thus li \u223c li\u2032 for each i and consequently\nW\nW\nl = li \u223cL li\u2032 = l\u2032 .\n\nRemark 71. Some easy consequences of the correspondence theorem:\n1. In a factorial W \u2217 -lattice of type I the parallelogram rule is automatically verified.\n2. In a factorial W \u2217 -lattice of type I there is only one dimensionable regular equivalence\nrelation, the perspective one.\nRemark 72. This remark is suggested by F. Radulescu ([Ra]).\nLet Ln be a W \u2217 -lattice of type In and Pn the projections lattice of Mn (C). The\ncorrespondence theorem guarantees Ln \u223c\n= Pn . A first consequence is the not obvious\ninclusion Ln \u0592\u2192 Ln+1 . Not obvious because it is not sufficient to chose those elements\nn\nn+1 :\n\nin Ln+1 whose dimension is less then\n\nthis is not a lattice! Actually this inclusion\n\ndoes not depend just by the correspondence theorem, but by the existence of references:\nchoose in Ln+1 a reference R = {m1 , ...mn+1 }, the sublattice generated by {m1 , ...mn } is\nisomorphic to Ln . This argument shows also that it is possible to choose references on Ln\nand Pn such that each square of the following diagram commute.\nL1\n\u000f\n\nL2\n\n\u03be1\n\n\u03be2\n\n\u000f\n\n\u000f\n\nLn+1\n\n\u000f\n/ P2\n\n...\u000f\n\n...\u000f\nLn\n\n/ P1\n\n\u03ben\n\n\u000f\n/ Pn\n\n\u03ben+1\n\n\u000f\n/ Pn+1\n\n...\u000f\n\n...\u000f\n26\n\n\f\u03ben being the isomorphisms induced by the choice of increasing references. Now, since the\nhyperfinite factor of type II1 is the inductive limit of Mn (C) with normalized trace, we\ncan find a factorial W \u2217 -lattice of type II1 as inductive limit of factorial W \u2217 -lattices of\ntype In . Moreover, this inductive limit coincides with the direct limit (with respect the\ncanonical inclusion) completed by cuts (Dedekind-MacNeille completing, see [MacN]).\nProblem 73. Does the concept of W \u2217 -lattice of type I axiomatize the projections lattice\nof a type I finite von Neumann algebra one?\n\n10\n\nA straightening theorem?\n\nIn this section we want to describe a possible improvement of the correspondence theorem.\nIndeed we believe it is possible to remove hypothesis on the existence of an orthogonal\ncomplement. This hope can be seem exaggerate and thus vain, but actually there are\nmany cases in which something similar happens. The main one, since it looks like the\nour case, is the following: a complex linear space V of dimension n is isomorphic to Cn ,\nwhich has a notion of orthogonality that we can transport on V . On the other hand, if we\nanalyze our construction we notice that the notion of orthogonality is been used only in\ntwo step: the first one is to define central elements and then the abelian ones. Nevertheless\nthe notion of factoriality, following von Neumann, does not really depend by the existence\nof central elements, but it mainly depends by the uniqueness of the inverse (see Def.29);\nmoreover, abelian elements allow only to prove the existence of minimal elements. Thus\nwe can require the existence of a minimal element as an axiom. The second step in which\nwe used the orthogonality is to define references. This is just what happens in the case of\na generic linear space of dimension n with respect to Cn : in a similar way, we believe it is\npossible to start from an affine reference (in the sense of the following definition) and to\nfind a lattice isomorphism with a factorial W \u2217 -lattice of type In , n being the cardinality\n(invariant!) of the affine reference.\nDefinition 74. An affine reference is a family of minimal elements R = {li } such that\n1.\n\nW\n\nli = 1\n\n2. Each subset of R does not verify the first condition.\n27\n\n\fDefinition 75. An irreducible and continuous lattice with minimal elements is an\nirreducible complete lattice such that |L| = |R| and M in(L) 6= \u2205.\nLet L be an irreducible and continuous lattice with minimal elements.\nRemark 76. The second condition of Def.74 implies that {li } are completely\nW\nindependents. Indeed, if not, let J and i0 such that li0 \u2264 j\u2208J lj and i0 \u2208\n/ J. Then\nW\ni\u2208I\\{i0 } li is still equal to 1. Consequently (in the case of irreducible and complete\nlattices) we can still apply th.44 and obtain that two affine references have the same finite\ncardinality.\nProposition 77. Each element of L is sup of a family of minimal elements.\nProof. Applying Prop. 37 (choosing l minimal instead abelian!) we have that each element\nW\nl \u2208 L contains minimal elements. If l\u2032 \u2208M in(l) l\u2032 < l we apply a classical lemma of J. von\nNeumann: if l\u2032 \u2264 l, there exists l\u2032\u2032 (independent to l\u2032 !) such that l\u2032 \u2228 l\u2032\u2032 = l. Take a\nminimal element contained in l\u2032 and find the absurd.\nConjecture 78. (Straightening theorem?) Let L be an irreducible and continuous\nlattice with minimal elements and let n be the cardinality of one of its affine reference.\nThere exists an involutory anti-automorphism \u22a5: L \u2192 L such that (L, \u2264, \u22a5) is a factorial\nlattice of type In .\nRemark 79. This should be the best theorem we can find, because it is quite simple\nto prove that the axioms of irreducible and continuous lattice with minimal elements are\nindependent: we can find examples of lattices satisfying all of them except one.\n\n11\n\nThe separable case\n\nThe main obstacle that we can find in order to extend the correspondence theorem to the\nseparable case is the absence of the modular property. But it is been used only to prove\nthat if l\u2032 \u2264 l, one can define l \u2212 l\u2032 . And this last property is been used only to prove that if\nthere exists a minimal element, then each element is sup of a family of minimal elements.\nWe think that there are no other way that assume this property as an axiom.\nDefinition 80. A factorial W \u2217 -lattice of type I\u03c9 is a factorial W \u2217 -lattice in which\n28\n\n\f1. Each element is sup of a family of minimal elements.\n2. 1 is sup of a countable family of minimal elements.\nTheorem 81. There exists only one (up to lattice isomorphism) factorial W \u2217 -lattice of\ntype I\u03c9 and it is the projection lattice of B(H), where H is a separable Hilbert space.\nProof. The proof is the same as in the finite dimensional case. Indeed results in Sect.8 still\nhold and we can still make the construction of the proof of the correspondence theorem\nthanks to the two properties 1. and 2. of Def.80.\nWe can also conjectured the straightening theorem in the separable case.\nConjecture 82. Let L be an irreducible, complete and continuous lattice such that\n1. Each element is sup of a family of minimal elements.\n2. 1 is sup of a countable family of minimal elements.\nThen there exists an involutory anti-automorphism \u22a5: L \u2192 L such that (L, \u2264, \u22a5) is a\nfactorial lattice of type I\u03c9 .\nWe want to thank Prof. F.
