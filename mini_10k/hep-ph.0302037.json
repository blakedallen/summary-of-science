General formulas have been established, notably those giving the final\nangular distributions in the case of the production of two vector mesons decaying into\npseudoscalar mesons.\nThe squared modulus of the decay amplitude has the following form:\n|A|2 \u221d h\u03bb,\u03bb\u2032 F\u03bb,\u03bb\u2032 (\u03b81 )G\u03bb,\u03bb\u2032 (\u03b82 , \u03c6),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere (summation over \u03bb(\u03bb\u2032 ) is omitted):\n\u2022 h\u03bb,\u03bb\u2032 is the matrix density element constructed from the weak effective hamiltonian\nHwef f taken between the initial state (B0 ) and the final state f .\n\u2022 F\u03bb,\u03bb\u2032 (\u03b81 ) and G\u03bb,\u03bb\u2032 (\u03b82 , \u03c6) are the matrix elements related to the decays V1 \u2192 a1 + b1\nand V2 \u2192 a2 + b2 respectively.\n\u2022 \u03b8j is the polar angle of particle aj in the rest frame of the resonance Vj while \u03c6 is\nthe angular difference \u03c62 \u2212 \u03c61 , where \u03c6j is the polar angle of aj in Vj rest frame.\n\u03bb(\u03bb\u2032 ) being the helicity state of the vector mesons; \u03bb = \u22121, 0, +1.\nAs it can be noticed, the essential parameters for the determination of the decay\ndynamics are the unknown matrix elements h\u03bb,\u03bb\u2032 ; while the two other ones, F\u03bb,\u03bb\u2032 (\u03b81 )\nand G\u03bb,\u03bb\u2032 (\u03b82 , \u03c6), are kinematic (or geometric) parameters because they are completely\ndetermined from the Wigner rotation matrices. The reader is referred to the note 99\u2212051\nfor a full kinematic description of the B 0 decay and the physical significance of the angles\n\u03b81,2 and \u03c6.\nBefore dealing with the mathematical determinations of the h\u03bb,\u03bb\u2032 elements, a simple\njustification of the two vector meson channel is given below.\n\n2\n\nQuantum numbers of the V10V20 system\n\nIn the case of two vector meson B 0 decay, the most interesting case is the one related to\nneutral mesons supplemented by the condition C|V 0 i i = \u2212|V 0 i i, where C is the charge\nconjugation operator and V 0 i is a neutral vector meson eigenstate of C. Some examples\nof these channels are:\n\u03c10 \u03c10 , J/\u03a8\u03c10 , J/\u03a8\u03a6, \u03a6\u03a6 . . .\nThese vector mesons have, in addition, the parity quantum number equal to \u22121.\n~ = s~B is equal\nNoticing that the total angular momentum of the V10 V20 system: J~ = ~l + S\n\n\f~ = s~1 + s~2 , with s1 = s2 = 1, the orbital angular\nto zero and because the total spin S\nmomentum can have three different values: l = S = 0, 1, 2.\nThus, parity, charge conjugation and CP quantum numbers of the V10 V20 system can\nbe computed:\nP (V10 V20 ) = (\u22121)2 (\u22121)l ,\n\nC(V10 V20 ) = (\u22121)2 ,\n\n\u21d3\nCP (V10 V20 ) = (\u22121)l .\nWe are led to the important result that the CP value of V10 V20 is a mixing of two\ndifferent eigenvalues +1 and \u22121 whatever the initial state (B 0 or B\u0304 0 ) is. A direct\nconsequence of this result is that CP symmetry is not an exact one.\nThe above relation does not hold for reactions involving a neutral K \u2217 like:\nBd0 \u2192 K \u22170 \u03c10 ,\n\nJ/\u03a8K \u22170 . . .\n\nbecause K \u22170 and K\u0304 \u22170 are two distinct particles; C|K \u22170 i = |K \u0304\u22170 i =\n6 |K \u22170 i.\nHowever, it is worth noticing two interesting features for channels with an intermediate\nresonance like K \u22170 (K \u0304\u22170 ):\nK \u22170 \u2192 K + \u03c0 \u2212 ,\n\nK 0\u03c00,\n\nK \u0304\u22170 \u2192 K \u2212 \u03c0 + ,\n\nK\u0304 0 \u03c0 0 .\n\nThe decay channels are in the ratio 2/3 and 1/3 respectively. On one hand, the sign\nof the charged kaon shows clearly the nature of the neutral K \u2217 from which it comes and\nconsequently the flavour of the original B 0 (B \u03040 ). So, a neutral K \u2217 decay is a direct way\nfor B 0 flavour tagging.\nOn the other hand, when a neutral K \u22170 (K \u0304\u22170 ) decays into K 0 (K\u0304 0 )\u03c0 0 , the neutral kaon\nK 0 (K\u0304 0 ) is not the true physical particle, because approximately 50% of the K 0 (K\u0304 0 ) go\ninto KS0 and 50% into KL0 respectively and the true detectable particle is KS0 which goes\nto \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 .\nThus, in the special channel:\nB 0 (B \u03040 ) \u2192 K \u22170 (K \u0304\u22170 )\u03c10 ,\n\u2192 KS0 \u03c0 0 ,\n\ntagging the original B 0 is no longer possible but, the KS0 \u03c0 0 being a common final state\nto both B 0 and B \u03040 , the above relation CP = (\u22121)l is still available [2].\nIn the following, emphasis will be put on the channels K \u22170(\u00b1) \u03c10 (\u03c9) and the physical\nimportance of the \u03c10 (\u03c9) mixing for the determination of CP violation.\n\n\fK*\u00b0 r\u00b0 ( w)\n\nB d\u00b0\n\nVub\n\nVtb\nr \u00b0( w)\n\nu\n\nV*ts\n\nW\n\ns\n\nb\n\nb\n\nd\n\nu\nW+\n\nB d\u00b0\n\nK*\u00b0\n\ng\n\nB d\u00b0\ns\n\nd\nd\n\nd\n\nV*us\n\nd\n\nd\n\nK*\u00b0\n\nTree\n\nr \u00b0(w)\n\nPenguin\n\nFigure 1: Tree and Penguin diagrams for the decay B 0 \u2192 K \u22170 \u03c10 (\u03c9).\n\n3\n\n\u03c10(\u03c9) mixing and its consequence\n\nIt is well known from hadronic physics that the neutral isovector \u03c18 and the isosinglet\n\u03c98 mix together, leading to the \"true\" physical resonances \u03c10 and \u03c9. On the\nphenomenological level, this mixing is made possible because of the existence of a common\nfinal state to both \u03c10 and \u03c9 decays [5]:\n\u03c10 \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 ,\n\u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0+\u03c0\u2212,\n\n(BR \u2248 100%),\n(BR \u2248 2.2%).\n\nIn the same framework, it has been established that the \u03c0\u03c0 final state interaction\nprovides a phase shift \u03b4 which reaches 90\u25e6 when the \u03c0\u03c0 invariant mass is at the \u03c9 pole\n(M\u03c9 = 782 MeV ) [6].\nThis interesting physical property has important consequences in the case where a \u03c10\nresonance is produced in some B 0\u00b1 decays like:\nB 0 \u2192 K \u22170 \u03c10 ,\n\n(F ig.1)\n\nB + \u2192 K \u2217+ \u03c10 , B \u2212 \u2192 K \u2217\u2212 \u03c10 ,\n\n(F ig.2)\n\nThese decays require both tree (T) and penguin (P) diagrams. As it is emphasized in\nreference [7], the amplitude A and \u0100 respectively for B + and B \u2212 decays can be set in the\n\n\f+\n\nK* + r\u00b0 ( w)\n\nBu\nVub\n\nu\nW+\n\nVub\n\nK *+\n\nb\n\nr \u00b0( w)\n\nb\n\ns\n\nu\n\nV*us\nu\n\nW+\n\nu\n\nu\n\ns\n\nu\n\nu\nu\n\nr \u00b0(w)\n\nV*us\n\nT ( color favoured )\n\nu\n\nK *+\n\nT ( color suppressed)\nVtb\n\nV*ts\n\nW\n\nK *+\n\ns\n\nb\nu\ng\n\nu\n\nu\nu\nu\n\nr \u00b0(w)\n\nPenguin\nFigure 2: Tree and Penguin diagrams for the decay B + \u2192 K \u2217+ \u03c10 (\u03c9).\nfollowing form:\nA = AT + AP = AT (1 + r exp (i\u03b4) exp (i\u03c6)),\n\n(2)\n\n\u0100 = \u0100T + \u0100P = AT (1 + r exp (i\u03b4) exp (\u2212i\u03c6)),\n\n(3)\n\nAP\nr= T ,\nA\n\n(4)\n\n\u0100T = AT , \u0100P = |AP |exp (i\u03b4) exp (\u2212i\u03c6).\n\n(5)\n\nwhere:\n\nExpressions of A and \u0100 displayed above suppose that final state interactions (FSI)\narise essentially from the penguin diagrams; this hypothesis is supported by the fact that,\n\n\fto order GF \u03b1s (GF and \u03b1s are respectively the Fermi constant and the QCD fine-structure\nconstant), the absorptive part of the transition amplitude is obtained from the penguin\ndiagrams [8].\nIn the special case of \u03c10 \u2212 \u03c9 mixing, another hypothesis is made using more intuitive\narguments: the phase shift due to the mixing is included in the FSI and it is predominating\nat the \u03c9 pole, justifying the above expressions of A and \u0100 that the phase shift \u03b4 is\nprincipally the one generated by the \u03c10 \u2212 \u03c9 mixing.\nBy CP transformation, the strong phase \u03b4 remains unchanged while the weak phase\n\u03c6, which is related to the CKM matrix elements, changes sign. Thus, the asymmetry\nparameter adir\nCP which can reveal direct CP violation can be deduced in the following way:\nadir\nCP =\n\nA2 \u2212 \u01002\n\u22122 sin \u03b4 sin \u03c6\n.\n=\n2\n2\n1 + r 2 + 2r cos \u03b4 cos \u03c6\nA + \u0100\n\n(6)\n\nIt is straightforward to notice that the parameter adir\nCP depends both on the strong\nphase and the weak phase and, consequently, the maximum value of adir\nCP can be reached\nif sin \u03b4 = 1, which allows us to state that the strong final state interaction (FSI) among\npions coming from the \u03c10 \u2212 \u03c9 decays enhances the direct CP violation in the vicinity of\nthe resonance \u03c9 mass.\nSimulation of the \u03c10 \u2212 \u03c9 mixing\nA simple and phenomenological relation describing the amplitude of the \u03c10 \u2212 \u03c9 mixing is\nused for the Monte-carlo simulations [9]. In the \u03c10 Breit-Wigner, the (\u03c10 ) propagator is\nreplaced by the following one:\nA=\n\nT\u03c9 \u03a0\u03c1\u03c9\n1\n+\n,\ns\u03c1\nT\u03c1 s\u03c1 s\u03c9\n\n(7)\n\nwhere\n\u2022 1/sV = 1/(s \u2212 MV 2 + i\u0393V MV ) is the V resonance propagator, MV and \u0393V being\nrespectively the mass and the width of the resonance V .\n\u2022 T\u03c9 and T\u03c1 are respectively the \u03c9 and \u03c1 production amplitudes.\n\u2022 \u03a0\u03c1\u03c9 is the mixing parameter for which recent values come from e+ e\u2212 annihilations:\nRe(\u03a0\u03c1\u03c9 ) = \u22123500 \u00b1 300 MeV 2 and Im(\u03a0\u03c1\u03c9 ) = \u2212300 \u00b1 300 MeV 2 .\nDue to the same physical processes which enter into the production of the \u03c10 and \u03c9\nresonances (they are both made out from u\u016b and dd \u0304 quark pairs with the same weight\n1/2), it seems natural to choose T\u03c9 /T\u03c1 = 1. So, the squared mass distribution of the \u03c0\u03c0\nsystem becomes simplified and it is given by:\n2\n\nd\u03c3/dm2 \u221d |A(\u03c10 (\u03c9))| ,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere A is the amplitude of the two Breit-Wigner given above and m is the \u03c0\u03c0\ninvariant mass.\n\n\fFigure 3: Spectrum (in GeV/c2 ) of \u03c10 Breit-Wigner (upper histogram) and \u03c10 \u2212 \u03c9 mixing\n(lower histogram).\n\n\fIn Figure 3, are displayed the \u03c0\u03c0 invariant mass spectra for the \u03c10 Breit-Wigner and\nthe \u03c10 \u2212 \u03c9 mixing respectively. Because of the very narrow \u03c9 width (\u0393\u03c9 = 8.44 MeV ),\nwe notice a high and narrow peak at the \u03c9 pole (\u2248 782 MeV ).\n\n4\n\nDynamics of the B \u2192 V1V2 decay\n\nThe formalism describing the B 0(\u00b1) decay into two vector mesons is derived from the\ngeneral formalism related to the hadronic weak decay of a heavy meson (or heavy quark).\nIt is based on the new concepts introduced by the Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET)\nwhich involves additionnal symmetry due to the high mass of the heavy quark (b or c\nquark) [10]. Technical calculations require a weak effective hamiltonian, Hwef f , by using\nthe \"Operator Product Expansions\" (OPE) pioneered by Wilson and which involve field\noperators describing both tree and penguin diagrams, the last ones include both QCD and\nelectroweak penguins (Figures 1 and 2).\nThe general form of Hwef f is given by:\n\u0010\n\u0011\nX10\nGF X\n\u2217\nVub Vuq\n(c1 O1 + c2 O2 ) \u2212 Vtb Vtq\u2217\nHw ef f = \u221a\nci O i ,\n(9)\nq=d,s\ni=3\n2\nwhere ci are the Wilson coefficients and Oi are field operators with dimension d \u2265 4;\nthey are computed at an energy scale \u03bc which is identified, here, with the b quark mass\nmb .\nIn the case of charmless B decays, Wilson coefficients have been calculated by Buchalla\net al [11]. These coefficients represent the perturbative part of the weak hamiltonian, they\nare estimated by the Renormalization Group techniques and their values depend on the\nrenormalization scheme which is used. Their physical significance is the weight of each\nfield operator Oi (\u03bc) entering in the weak hamiltonian Hwef f . From reference [12], the\nvalues of ci which have been computed at the energy scale \u03bc = mb are:\nc1 = \u22120.3125,\nc3 = 0.0174,\nc5 = 0.0104,\n\nc2 = 1.1502,\nc4 = \u22120.0373,\n\nc6 = \u22120.0459,\n\nc7 = \u22121.050 \u00d7 10\u22125 ,\nc9 = \u22120.0101,\n\nc8 = 3.839 \u00d7 10\u22124 ,\n\nc10 = 1.959 \u00d7 10\u22123 .\n\n(10)\n\nThe first two coefficients, c1 and c2 , are related to the tree diagrams and they show\nclearly their dominance with respect to the penguin ones. Coefficients c3 \u2212 c6 correspond\nto QCD penguin operators while c7 \u2212 c10 are related to the EW ones.\nHowever, those values of ci must be modified when renormalization of operator Oi at\none-loop order is taken into account.\nDetailed expressions of operators Oi (\u03bc) and their physical interpretation are given in\nreference [13].\nThus, a general form for the weak decay amplitude into a final state f can be expressed\nlike:\n\n\f10\n\nGF X X i\n\u03bbq ci (\u03bc)hf |Oi (\u03bc)|B 0 i,\nA(B 0 \u2192 f ) = hf |Hwef f |B 0 i = \u221a\n2 i=1 q=d,s\n\n(11)\n\n\u2217\nwhere \u03bbq i is the product of two CKM matrix elements: Vub Vuq\n(for i = 1, 2) or (Vtb Vtq\u2217 )\n(for i = 3, . . . , 10).\n\nThe hadronic matrix elements hf |Oi (\u03bc)|B 0i represent the non-perturbative\ncontribution to the amplitude A(B 0 \u2192 f ). Usually, they are estimated according to some\nspecific models: Non Relativistic Quark Model (NRQM), Form Factor models (BSW) and\nespecially the Lattice QCD calculations.\nIn the following, calculation of the hadronic matrix elements is performed in the\nframework of the BSW model [14] from which form factors are derived by the knowledge\nof the hadronic wave functions for both initial and final states.\n\n5\n\nDetermination of the density-matrix elements\n\nThe B 0 decay into two vector mesons requires the helicity formalism which has been\nintensively used in the previous paper [1]. To each vector meson (spin 1) is assigned a set\nof three polarization 4-vectors defined in this way:\n\u0010\n\u0011\n~\n\u01eb1 = (0, \u01eb~1 ), \u01eb2 = (0, \u01eb~2 ), \u01eb3 = |k|/m, E k\u0302/m ,\n(12)\nand verifying the following relations:\n\n\u01ebi 2 = \u22121, \u01ebi * \u01ebj = 0, with i 6= j,\n\n(13)\n\nwhere m, E, ~k are respectively the mass, the energy and the momentum of the vector\nmeson; k\u0302 is defined as the unit vector along the vector momentum, k\u0302 = ~k/|~k|.\nThe three vectors \u01eb~1 , \u01eb~2 and \u01eb~3 = E k\u0302/m form an orthogonal basis; \u01eb1 and \u01eb2 are called\nthe transverse polarization vectors while \u01eb~3 is the longitudinal polarization one.\nFrom that basis, an helicity basis is defined according to:\n(\u01eb1 + i\u01eb2 )\n(\u01eb1 \u2212 i\u01eb2 )\n\u221a\n\u221a\n, \u01eb(\u2212) =\n, \u01eb(0) = \u01eb3 .\n(14)\n2\n2\nThese 4-vectors are eigenvectors of the helicity operator H with the eigenvalues\n\u03bb = +1, \u22121 and 0 respectively. For a clear account of the helicity basis for a spin 1\nparticle, the reader can consult the book of Dewitt-Smith [15].\n\u01eb(+) =\n\nIn the case of two vector mesons coming from the B decay, their 4-momenta are defined\nin the B rest frame and their corresponding polarization vectors are correlated because\nk\u02c61 = \u2212k\u02c62 . For an explicit calculation of their spatial components, see the appendix A.\nThe weak hadronic amplitude is then decomposed on the helicity basis according to\nthe general formalism developed by the authors BSW [14]. This method allows one to\nobtain two interesting results:\n\n\f\u2022 the contribution of the tree and penguin operators to the global amplitude via the\nhelicity states.\n\u2022 the total contribution of each helicity state.\nA way of illustrating this method is to study the channel: B 0 (B\u0304 0 ) \u2192 K \u22170 (K\u0304 \u22170 )\u03c10 .\n(i) First of all, the mass of each resonance (K \u22170 and \u03c10 ) is generated according to a\nrelativistic Breit-Wigner:\nd\u03c3\ndM 2\n\n= C\n\nC being a normalization constant.\n\n\u0393R MR\n2\n\n(M 2 \u2212 MR2 ) + (\u0393R MR )2\n\n,\n\n(15)\n\n(ii) The weak hadronic matrix element is expressed as the sum of three helicity\nmatrix elements; each one of the form, H\u03bb = hV1 V2 |Hw ef f |Bi, is defined by gathering all\nthe Wilson coefficients of both tree and penguin operators. Linear combinations of those\ncoefficients arise like: c\u03c1t1 , c\u03c1p1 , and c\u03c1p2 (see Appendix B) and the helicity amplitude H\u03bb\ngets the following expression:\n\u0011n\n\u0010\n\u03b3 \u03b4\n\u2217\u03b2\n\u2217 \u03c1\nH\u03bb = Vub Vus\nct1 \u2212 Vtb Vts\u2217 c\u03c1p2 \u03b21 \u03b5\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 \u01eb\u2217\u03b1\nK (\u03bb)\u01eb\u03c1 (\u03bb)PB PK\n\u0010\n\u0011o\n+i \u03b22 \u01eb\u2217K (\u03bb)\u01eb\u2217\u03c1 (\u03bb) \u2212 \u03b23 (\u01eb\u2217K (\u03bb).PB )(\u01eb\u2217\u03c1 (\u03bb).PB )\n\u0011n\n\u0010\n\u2217\u03b2\n\u03b3 \u03b4\n\u2217 \u03c1\n+ \u2212 Vtb Vts cp1 \u03b24 \u03b5\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 \u01eb\u2217\u03b1\n\u03c1 (\u03bb)\u01ebK (\u03bb)PB P\u03c1 ,\n\u0010\n\u0011o\n+ i \u03b25 \u01eb\u2217\u03c1 (\u03bb)\u01eb\u2217K (\u03bb) \u2212 \u03b26 (\u01eb\u2217\u03c1 (\u03bb).PB )(\u01eb\u2217K (\u03bb).PB )\n\n(16)\n\nwith:\n\u2022 \u03b5\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 : antisymmetric tensor in the Minkowski space.\n\u2022 \u03b21,4 =\n\nGF\n2\n\n2\nf\u03c1,K m\u03c1,K \u2217 mB +m\n\n\u2022 \u03b22,5 =\n\nGF\n2\n\nf\u03c1,K m\u03c1,K \u2217 (mB + mK \u2217 ,\u03c1 )AB\u2192K\n1\n\n\u2022 \u03b23,6 =\n\nGF\n2\n\n2\nf\u03c1,K m\u03c1,K \u2217 mB +m\nAB\u2192K\n2\nK \u2217 ,\u03c1\n\nK \u2217 ,\u03c1\n\nV B\u2192K\n\n\u2217 ,\u03c1\n\n\u2217 ,\u03c1\n\n(m2\u03c1,K \u2217 ).\n\u2217 ,\u03c1\n\n(m2\u03c1,K \u2217 ).\n\n(m2\u03c1,K \u2217 ).\n\n\u2022 fK , f\u03c1 : respectively K \u22170 and \u03c10 decay constants.\n\u2022 V B\u2192K\n\n\u2217 ,\u03c1\n\n, AiB\u2192K\n\n\u2217 ,\u03c1\n\n: respectively Vector and Axial form factors (see Appendix C).\n\n\u2022 \u01ebK,\u03c1 (\u03bb): K \u22170 , \u03c10 polarization vectors expressed in the B rest frame.\nIt is worth noticing that the tensorial terms which enter H\u03bb become simplified in\nthe B rest frame because the B 4-momentum is given by PB = (mb , ~0).

In our study, these spectra are obtained\nfor the four couples of values: (0.09, 0.323); (0.09, 0.442); (0.254, 0.323) and (0.254, 0.442).\nBut, due to the fact that some density matrix elements do not vary too much with \u03c1 and\n\u03b7, in most cases only the spectra corresponding to the first couple of values are shown.\nAll the histograms correspond to a sample of 20000 generated events.\nIt is important to notice that large spectrum of values for h\u03bb,\u03bb\u2032 are obtained and not\nsingle ones because of the broad range of both the \u03c10 resonance mass and the common\nmomentum |~p| (see the analytical expressions of B(\u03bb) and C(\u03bb) given above).\n\u2022 Whatever the values of \u03c1 and \u03b7 are, the dominant value of h++ = |H+1 |2 is \u2264 10\u22122,\nnumerical result which is proved too by complete analytical calculations. Thus the\ndominant polarization state is the longitudinal one because h00 = |H0 |2 \u2265 60%,\nits mean value being around 85% (Fig.4).\n\u2022 Due to the tiny value of |H+1 |, the modulus of the non-diagonal elements h+\u2212 =\nH+ H\u2212 \u2217 and h+0 = H+ H0 \u2217 are usually smaller than 0.2; while the modulus of\nh\u22120 = H\u2212 H0 \u2217 can reach 0.5 (Fig.5).\nFig.6 and Fig.7 display the variations of the diagonal matrix elements h\u2212\u2212 , h00 and h++\nwith respect to the four sets of \u03c1 and \u03b7 values: it can be seen that h++ has always a tiny\nvalue and h00 is always dominant. Other physical features appear: h00 is very sensitive to\nthe parameter \u03b7; its spectrum is rather wide for \u03b7 = 0.323, while it is bounded between 0.8\nand 1.0 for \u03b7 = 0.442. For a fixed value of \u03b7, no noticeable variation with the parameter\n\u03c1 is seen.\nFig.8 shows the real and imaginary parts of the non-diagonal elements h\u22120 , h+\u2212 , h+0\nrespectively for \u03c1 = 0.09 and \u03b7 = 0.323. It is worth noticing that both real and imaginary\nparts of h+\u2212 and h+0 are too small and close to zero.\nDue to the importance of h+\u2212 matrix element in the \u03c6 angle distribution (see Section\n6), a full study of both real and imaginary parts of h+\u2212 has been done. Fig.9 shows the\ncorresponding spectra according to the values of \u03c1 and \u03b7. It can be deduced that the\nreal and imaginary parts have very similar distributions and both are dominated by small\nvalues (\u2264 0.05).\n\n\f10000\n\n1000\n\n100\n\n10\n\n1\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n10000\n\n1000\n\n100\n\n10\n\n1\n100000\n\n10000\n\n1000\n\n100\n\n10\n\n1\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\nFigure 4: Diagonal matrix elements: h\u2212\u2212 , h00 , h++ respectively for \u03c1 = 0.09, \u03b7 = 0.323.\n\n\f10000\n\n1000\n\n100\n\n10\n\n1\n0\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\n\n0.2\n\n0.25\n\n0.3\n\n0.35\n\n0.4\n\n0.45\n\n0.5\n\n0.35\n\n0.4\n\n0.45\n\n0.5\n\n0.35\n\n0.4\n\n0.45\n\n0.5\n\n100000\n\n10000\n\n1000\n\n100\n\n10\n\n1\n0\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\n\n0.2\n\n0.25\n\n0.3\n\n10000\n\n1000\n\n100\n\n10\n\n1\n0\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\n\n0.2\n\n0.25\n\n0.3\n\nFigure 5: Modulus of non diagonal matrix elements: h0\u2212 , h+\u2212 , h+0 respectively for\n\u03c1 = 0.09, \u03b7 = 0.323.\n\n\f10000\n\n1000\n\n100\n\n10\n\n1\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n10000\n\n1000\n\n100\n\n10\n\n1\n100000\n\n10000\n\n1000\n\n100\n\n10\n\n1\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\nFigure 6: Variations of h\u2212\u2212 , h00 , h++ according to Wolfenstein parameters: \u03c1 = 0.09, \u03b7 =\n0.323 (full line) and \u03b7 = 0.442 (dashed line).\n\n\f10000\n\n1000\n\n100\n\n10\n\n1\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n10000\n\n1000\n\n100\n\n10\n\n1\n100000\n\n10000\n\n1000\n\n100\n\n10\n\n1\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\nFigure 7: Variations of h\u2212\u2212 , h00 , h++ according to Wolfenstein parameters: \u03c1 = 0.254, \u03b7 =\n0.323 (full line) and \u03b7 = 0.442 (dashed line).\n\n\f0.5\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\n-0.1\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.3\n-0.5\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.3\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.1\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.2\n\n0.15\n\n0.1\n\n0.05\n\n0\n\n-0.05\n\n-0.1\n\n-0.15\n\n-0.2\n-0.3\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.1\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n-0.3\n\n-0.25\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.15\n\n-0.1\n\n-0.05\n\n0\n\n0.05\n0.04\n0.03\n0.02\n0.01\n0\n-0.01\n-0.02\n-0.03\n-0.04\n-0.05\n-0.35\n\nFigure 8: Imaginary part vs Real part of matrix elements h0\u2212 , h+\u2212 , h+0 respectively for\n\u03c1 = 0.09, \u03b7 = 0.323.\n\n\f10000\n\n1000\n\n100\n\n10\n\n1\n0\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\n\n0.2\n\n0.25\n\n0.3\n\n100000\n\n10000\n\n1000\n\n100\n\n10\n\n1\n0\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\n\n0.2\n\n0.25\n\n0.3\n\n0\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\n\n0.2\n\n0.25\n\n0.3\n\n0\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\n\n0.2\n\n0.25\n\n0.3\n\n100000\n\n10000\n\n1000\n\n100\n\n10\n\n1\n100000\n\n10000\n\n1000\n\n100\n\n10\n\n1\n\nFigure 9: Real part (full line) and Imaginary part (dashed line) of h+\u2212 matrix element\nfor (\u03c1, \u03b7) = (0.09, 0.323); (0.09, 0.442); (0.254, 0.323) and (0.254, 0.442) respectively.\n\n\f6\n\nDecays of vector mesons V1 V2 into two pseudoscalar\nmesons\n\nThe matrix elements derived above allow us to compute the degrees of polarization of each\nresonance like K \u2217 or \u03c10 . The angular distributions of the pseudoscalar mesons in each Vi\nrest frame depend on:\n(i) the spin 1 of the vector meson Vi .\n(ii) the weight of each helicity state.\n(iii) the correlations among the helicity states of the two vector mesons.\nComplete analytical expression of the final angular distributions is the following one:\nd3 \u0393\n\u221d (h++ + h\u2212\u2212 )sin2 \u03b81 sin2 \u03b82 /4 + h00 cos2 \u03b81 cos2 \u03b82\nd cos \u03b81 d cos \u03b82 d\u03c6\n+ (Re(h+0 )cos \u03c6 \u2212 Im(h+0 )sin \u03c6 + Re(h0\u2212 )cos \u03c6 \u2212 Im(h0\u2212 )sin \u03c6) sin 2\u03b81 sin 2\u03b82 /4\n+ (Re(h+\u2212 )cos 2\u03c6 \u2212 Im(h+\u2212 )sin 2\u03c6) sin2 \u03b81 sin2 \u03b82 /2.\n(22)\nAngles \u03b81 , \u03b82 and \u03c6 have been defined in Section 1.\nExplicit angular distributions for polar and azimuthal angles can be derived from the\nrelation above. It is interesting to notice that, due to the pseudoscalar nature of the final\nparticles, angles \u03b81 and \u03b82 have the same distributions:\n\u2022 d\u03c3/dcos \u03b81,2 \u221d (3h00 \u2212 1) cos2 \u03b81,2 + (1 \u2212 h00 ).\n\u2022 d\u03c3/d\u03c6 \u221d (1 + 2(Re(h+\u2212 ) cos 2\u03c6 \u2212 Im(h+\u2212 ) sin 2\u03c6)).\nIn Fig.10 are displayed respectively the cos \u03b8 distribution and the azimuthal angle \u03c6\none. Some comments on these curves are necessary:\n\u2022 The cos \u03b8 distribution is practically the same whatever the values of \u03c1 and \u03b7 are; no\nsensitivity to particular values of \u03c1 and \u03b7 is seen.\n\u2022 As far as angle \u03c6 is concerned, its distribution depends on the matrix element h+\u2212 .\nDespite the fact that Re(h+\u2212 ) and Im(h+\u2212 ) do not exhibit sensitive differences\n(see Fig.9), those parameters present some dependence upon \u03c1 and \u03b7: full curve\ncorresponds to \u03c1 = 0.09, \u03b7 = 0.323; while dashed one is related to \u03c1 = 0.254, \u03b7 =\n0.442. A visible discrepancy among these two curves is seen.\n\n\f2000\n1800\n1600\n1400\n1200\n1000\n800\n600\n400\n200\n0\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n400\n\n350\n\n300\n\n250\n\n200\n\n150\n\n100\n\n50\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nFigure 10: Cos\u03b8 distribution (upper figure) and azimuthal angle \u03c6 distribution (lower\nfigure) for \u03c1 = 0.09, \u03b7 = 0.323 (full line) and \u03c1 = 0.254, \u03b7 = 0.442 (dashed line)\nrespectively.\n\n\f7\n\nPerspectives and conclusion\n\n\u2022 Thanks to the HQET approach and the OPE formalism which is used, we have at our\ndisposal rigorous and complete calculations of the dynamics of the B 0\u00b1 decays into two\nvector mesons. This formalism is available for all charmless B decays provided the spin\nof the intermediate resonance(s) is less or equal 1; the only changes which must be taken\ninto account are the VCKM matrix elements, the masses and the widths of the resonances\ninvolved in each decay.\n\u2022 In the case of leptonic decay of one resonance, like J/\u03a8 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 , \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 , the angular\ndistributions are modified because of the spin 1/2 final leptons; which require the use of\nother Wigner rotation matrices. Those calculations have been already done in our first\npaper [1].\n\u2022 In the case where a (cc\u0304) bound state or a charmed meson is produced like:\nB 0 \u2192 J/\u03a8\u03c10 , D \u2217 X(X = \u03c10 , \u03c9, K \u22170 ),\nthe Wilson coefficients involved in the effective hamiltonian have to be modified, but\nwe do not expect big change with respect to the ci (c\u2032i ) coefficients used in the present\npaper.\n\u2022 Other interesting consequences arise from this formalism: it can be easily extended\nto the numerous channels like: B \u2192 V P, P P where one or two pseudoscalar mesons\n(P = 0\u2212+ ) are produced directly from the B decay. Because of the simple equality\n\u03bb(P ) = \u03bb(V ) = 0, the number of helicity states is reduced from 3 to 1.\n\u2022 An important point which has been mentionned in the present note is the role of\nthe \u03c10 \u2212 \u03c9 mixing and its consequence for the determination of the direct CPV parameter\n(Section 3 and reference [7]). Tagging of B + and B \u2212 is made easy thanks to the K +\nand K \u2212 mesons coming from the cascade decays. In our opinion, we can also exploit all\nthe angular distributions of the final particles (and their correlations) in order to detect\nan eventual discrepancy which can arise between the B + and B \u2212 decays respectively.\nHowever, a complete study of those channels and their simulations require the knowledge\nof the strong phase shift \u03b4 (mentionned in Section 3) according to the \u03c0\u03c0 invariant mass.\nWork is in progress.\n\u2022 Those calculations and simulations can be implemented into SICBMC, the MonteCarlo generator of the LHCb experiment, in order to perform afterwards a full analysis\nof the simulated channels.\n\n\fAcknowledgements\nThe authors are very grateful to Dr P.Perret, leader of the LHCb Clermont-Ferrand team,\nfor his advices and his
