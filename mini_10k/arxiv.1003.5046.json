If several practical barriers can\nbe overcome and electromechanical transducers of sufficient sensitivity are developed, then it should be possible\nto monitor massive Weber-bar gravitational wave antennae in the regime in which their behavior is dominated by\nquantum effects, i.e., by the measurement process itself. Thus a class of experiments in which repeated measurements\nare performed on a single isolated macroscopic quantum-mechanical oscillator may become possible [3, 4].\nSo far superconducting-quantum-interference-device (SQUID)-based electromechanical transducers have offered the\nbest opportunity to study the quantum regime. However, recently it was pointed out that the tunneling probe used\nin the scanning tunneling microscope is a quantum limited electromechanical amplifier and therefore may present an\nopportunity to study the quantum regime with electromechanical transducers [5].\nSince the tunneling transducer is intrinsically a quantum device, without a classical analog, a quantum analysis\nis required to understand the origin of its noise. It was shown that there are two independent sources of noise in\nthe tunneling transducer [6, 7]. The first is the well-known shot noise of the tunneling current which enters as an\napparent fluctuation of the test mass. The other source of noise is a fluctuating \"back-action\" force which the tunneling\ntransducer exerts on the test mass. The two sources of noise work in concert to add to the amplified mechanical signal\nan amount of noise power equivalent to one-half quantum of energy per second at the operating frequency. Recently\nYurke and Kochanski presented a full quantum-mechanical analysis of the noise of a tunneling transducer [8]. They\nused a second-quantized description of electron tunneling through a barrier to find an expression for the uncertainty\nin the width of the tunneling barrier, which is equivalent to the position of the test mass, based upon the tunneling\ncurrent fluctuations. They also computed the fluctuation of the momentum current transported across the barrier.\nTheir calculations explicitly show that the tunneling transducer enforces the Heisenberg uncertainty relation between\nthe position and momentum of the test mass.\nThe purpose of this paper is twofold. The first purpose is to present a simplified, first-quantization treatment of\nthe noise in the tunneling transducer. Although we obtain the same expressions for the uncertainties as Yurke and\nKochanski in Ref. 8, we think that the use of first quantization to deal with this problem is more physically intuitive\nand less mathematically complex. The second purpose of this paper is to discuss some of the practical considerations\nregarding the tunneling transducer and the prospects for achieving quantum noise limited force detection.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, after a brief description of the working principles of the tunneling\ntransducer, we express the position and the momentum uncertainties in terms of the time-independent solutions of\nthe Schr\u00f6dinger equation. The position uncertainty is derived from the transmission coefficient and the momentum\nuncertainty is obtained by a generalization of the current flux. In Sec. III we apply these considerations to calculate\nthe position and momentum uncertainty product for symmetric and asymmetric rectangular barriers. In Sec. IV we\ntreat the case of a barrier in which there is a constant electric field. In Sec. V we discuss the practical obstacles to\nachieving quantum noise dominance and we give a specific example of a configuration in which quantum effects may\nbe observed. In Sec. VI we discuss some conceptual problems in making the correspondence between the quantum\nmechanical uncertainties which are calculated here and the more experimentally relevant classical description of noise\nwhich employs spectral densities of random variables.\n\n\f2\nII.\n\nPOSITION AND MOMENTUM UNCERTAINTIES FOR A TUNNELING TRANSDUCER\n\nThe tunneling transducer is simply a variable resistance transducer. The motion of a test mass modulates the\ngap of a vacuum tunnel junction thus affecting the tunneling probability. If the junction is voltage biased then the\ncurrent measured by an amplifier which follows the tunnel probe provides a sensitive measure of the tunneling gap\nand therefore of the displacement of the test mass.\nIn Figure 1 we show a schematic representation of the tunneling transducer. A tunneling tip is places a distance\nl from the test mass which is going to be monitored. The displacement of the test mass from its initial position is\ngiven by x. The effective resistance of the tunneling transducer is given, in the limit k0 l \u226b 1, by the familiar formula\nR = R0 e\u22122k0 x ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere k0 is the inverse of the de Broglie wavelength of the electrons with energy E inside the barrier of height V0 and\nis given by\n\u0014\n\n2m(V0 \u2212 E)\nk0 =\n~2\n\n\u00151/2\n\n.\n\n(2)\n\nThe tunneling resistance R0 is usually around 106 \u2212 108 \u03a9 and a typical value of k0 is 1010 m\u22121 ; the distance scale\nover which the tunneling resistance change significantly is of atomic dimensions. For typical values of the tunnel\nprobe voltage bias the tunneling current is in the range of nanoamps to microamps. Using conventional electronic\ntechniques it is possible to measure extremely small fractional changes in currents of this magnitude so it is possible\nwith the tunnel junction transducer to measure displacements which are a very small fraction of k0\u22121 .\nIt is important that the capacitance between the tunneling probe and the test mass be small, on the order of\n10\u221217 F or less [7]. This ensures that the quantum effects associated with the tunneling transducer will dominate the\nback-action force fluctuations that have their origin in the amplifier used to sense the tunneling current and which\nare capacitively coupled to the test mass. This assumption allows us to concentrate on the fluctuations which arise\nfrom the tunneling process.\nWe express the uncertainties in the position and the momentum of the test mass which is sensed by the tunneling\ntransducer in terms of solutions of the time-independent Schr\u00f6dinger equation which describes the motion of a particle\nin the presence of a one-dimensional barrier. Let us assume that there are N electrons attempting to tunnel out of\nthe probe. We treat each tunneling process as independent from the others, this approximation being satisfactory for\nthe realistic tunneling currents that can be obtained. For each electron there is a probability T that it will tunnel and\na probability R = 1 \u2212 T that it will not tunnel, where T and R are, respectively, the transmission and the reflection\ncoefficients associated with the barrier. The probability that n < N electrons will escape from the probe is given by\nthe binomial law, therefore the average number of electrons which escape will be hni = N T and the variance of the\naverage is\n(\u2206n)2 = h(n \u2212 hni)2 i = N T R\n\n(3)\n\nThe variance of the number of electrons which tunnel may be written as a function of the transmission coefficient\nand the gap between the tip and the test mass:\n\n\u2206n = N |\n\n\u2202T\n|\u2206l\n\u2202l\n\n(4)\n\nand the uncertainty in the position of the barrier therefore is inferred as\n\u221a\n1\nTR\n.\n\u2206l = \u221a\n\u2202T\nN | \u2202l |\n\n(5)\n\nWhen |\u2202T /\u2202l| = 0 a second-order expansion must be employed; however, in all the situations which we explore in\nwhat follows, a first-order expansion of (5) is adequate.\nIn order to calculate the uncertainty in the momentum transferred to the barrier we first consider the continuity\nequation for the probability flux\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 1: Scheme for the detection of displacement through a vacuum-tunneling transducer. The \"at-rest\" separation between\nthe test mass and the tunneling probe is l and the displacement of the test mass is x.

Note that (9) expresses Newton's law in quantum mechanical terms, the right-hand side of\n(9) being the force density which acts on the particle. Also, a feature of (14) deserves comment. As we will see in\nthe following examples Jp2 is negative inside the barrier which is a consequence of the following. The barrier is a\nclassically forbidden region so the kinetic energy flux Jp2 /2m associated with a particle inside the barrier is negative\nwhich makes the \"momentum squared\" flux Jp2 negative also.\nFollowing Yurke and Kochanski's approach let us imagine that the potential V (x) represents a barrier located\nbetween a < x < b, and V (x) is zero outside of this region. We decompose the force of the potential barrier on a\ntunneling particle into two parts, \u2202V /\u2202x = \u2202V1 /\u2202x + \u2202V2 /\u2202x, where V1 is associated with the tunneling probe at the\nlocation a and the potential V2 is attributed to the test mass surface at b. To calculate the momentum uncertainty\nimparted to the test mass we must find the momentum and 'momentum-squared\" fluxes passing through a surface at\nb. The momentum current transferred to the part of the barrier at b is obtained by using the stationary version of\n(9) where V (x) is replaced with V2 (x), i.e.\nJpt = Jp (b+ ) +\n\nZ\n\nb+\n\na\u2212\n\n\u2202V2 \u2217\n\u03c8 \u03c8dx.\n\u2202x\n\n(15)\n\nThe \"momentum squared\" flux transferred to the barrier at b is, using Eq. (12),\nJpt2\n\n+\n\n= Jp2 (b ) \u2212 i~\n\nZ\n\nb+\n\na\u2212\n\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u2202V2\n\u2202\u03c8 \u2217\n\u2217 \u2202\u03c8\n\u03c8\n\u2212\n\u03c8 dx\n\u2202x\n\u2202x\n\u2202x\n\n(16)\n\nDividing Jpt and Jpt2 by the incident flux Jin we obtain the momentum and \"momentum squared\" transferred to the\npotential barrier at b by a single tunneling particle. Finally, the momentum and \"momentum squared\" transferred\nto the test mass is related in the following fashion to the momentum and \"momentum squared\" transferred to the\nbarrier from the electron. In our model, the test mass is schematized by a potential step at a fixed location in\nspace. The test mass can be thought of as an infinitely rigid oscillator with a surface fixed at the location b; this\nis the effect of the feedback system which is actually used to prevent the test mass position from drifting under the\neffect of the continuous stream of electrons impinging on it. Therefore the test mass has a quantum-mechanical wave\nfunction which rapidly decays away from b. In a plane-wave representation, this corresponds to a superposition of\nplane waves with imaginary momenta. Thus a localized particle, in this case the test mass at b, with real momentum\ncan be viewed as a free quasiparticle with imaginary momentum. Thus the mean momentum imparted to the test\nmass is hpi = iJpt /Jin which is i times the momentum transferred to the barrier from each electron tunneling event.\nAs a consequence the mean \"momentum squared\" imparted to the test mass is hp2 i = \u2212Jpt2 /Jin .

First we\nsolve the time-independent Schr\u00f6dinger equation to find the electron wave function in the presence of the barrier.\nFrom this we can calculate the transmission and reflection coefficients and therefore \u2206l with the use of Eq.

II to calculate the uncertainty product \u2206l\u2206p for rectangular\nbarriers, both symmetric [see Fig. 2(a)] and asymmetric [see Fig. 2(b)] cases.\nIn the symmetric barrier case the wave function which solves the time-independent Schr\u00f6dinger equation can be\nexpresses as\n1\nx<a\n\u03c8k (x) = \u221a [eikx + r(k)e\u2212ikx ],\n2\u03c0\n1\n\u03c8k (x) = \u221a [C + (k)ek0 x + C \u2212 (k)e\u2212k0 x ],\na<x<b\n(18)\n2\u03c0\n1\n\u03c8k (x) = \u221a t(k)eikx ,\nx > b,\n2\u03c0\np\n\u221a\nwhere ~k = 2mE and ~k0 = 2m(V0 \u2212 E). The normalization of the wave function used throughout this paper\ncorresponds to an incident flux Jin = 1/2\u03c0(~k/m).\nBy imposing the matching conditions for \u03c8 and the first derivative of \u03c8 at a and b we obtain\nt(k) =\n\n2ik0 ke\u2212ik(b\u2212a)\n.\n2ik0 k cosh[k0 (b \u2212 a)] \u2212 (k02 \u2212 k 2 ) sinh[k0 (b \u2212 a)]\n\n(19)\n\nThe uncertainty in the position \u2206l can be calculated using Eq.

(15) and (16) we then have\nJpt =\n\n1 ~2 2\n(k \u2212 k02 )T,\n2\u03c0 2m\n\nJpt2 = \u2212\n\n1 ~3 2\nk kT.\n2\u03c0 m 0\n\n(23)\n\n(24)\n\n\f6\nAccording to (17), we get\n(\u2206p)2 = N\n\n~2\nT [4k 2 k02 + (k 2 \u2212 k02 )2 T ].\n4k 2\n\n(25)\n\nOn multiplying \u2206l and \u2206p we obtain \u2206l\u2206p = ~/2, i.e., the minimum uncertainty product for the test mass. The\nuncertainty principle here may be regarded as arising from the interaction with the tunneling electrons during the\nprocess of measurement.\nThe same calculations can be repeated for an asymmetric rectangular barrier as in Fig. 2(b), schematizing an\nunbiased barrier between two materials having different work functions.

The detailed calculation of \u2206p is shown in the Appendix, as well as the explicit form of the derivative of\nthe transmission coefficient which allows us to obtain \u2206l.\nIn Fig. 4 the momentum uncertainty and the transmission coefficient are shown as functions of the applied voltage.\nWe observe that as the potential drop across the barrier is increased the momentum uncertainty increases. This\ncan be understood in the following way: when the electric field is increased the barrier is more transparent to the\nelectrons and can be effectively represented by a lower rectangular barrier. Thus the electron current increases and\n\u2206l is reduced. The uncertainty relation therefore requires a larger values of the momentum uncertainty.\nIn Fig. 5 the uncertainty product versus the applied voltage is shown for the case of V0 =5 eV and E =1 eV. The\nminimum uncertainty product is obtained in the absence of an applied voltage which can also be verified by examining\nthe asymptotic behavior of the Airy functions in the limit of \u03c6 \u2192 0. The increase of the uncertainty product \u2206l\u2206p as\nthe applied voltage is raised is due, at least in part, to a correlation between \u2206l and \u2206p induced by the electric field\nin the gap. The mechanism for the growth of the correlation is the following: an initial momentum dispersion of the\nelectrons will be transformed into a spatial dispersion as the electrons traverse the barrier under the influence of the\nelectric field. The magnitude of the correlation has been explicitly calculated in Ref. 8. A detailed discussion of the\ncorrelation between the uncertainties in momentum and position may be important for understanding techniques to\nsurpass the standard quantum limit by using time-dependent tunnel probe bias voltages. This is a topic for further\ninvestigation.\nV.\n\nPRACTICAL CONFIGURATIONS FOR REACHING THE QUANTUM NOISE IN TUNNELING\nTRANSDUCERS\n\nIn this section we discuss some experimental aspects of quantum measurements with a tunneling transducer. To\ncompare the quantum noise with the classical sources of noise we have to introduce a \"quantum\" force noise spectral\ndensity which allows us to use the usual techniques of stochastic processes [9]. We do not claim to rigorously define\nsuch an effective noise spectral density, although it may be possible to define such a tool in the framework of Nelson's\nstochastic mechanics [10]. Following Ref. 8 we write the spectral density of the force fluctuations in terms of the\nvariance of the momentum current per unit bandwidth\nSfQ = 2\n\n(\u2206p)2\n,\n\u03c4\n\n(44)\n\n\f9\n\nFIG. 5: Uncertainty product \u2206l\u2206p in units ~ = 1 for the test mass vs. the applied voltage in a rectangular barrier with a\nconstant electric field. At a bias of 0 V, \u2206l\u2206p = ~/2, the value for a rectangular barrier.\n\nwhere the effective force spectral density for the quantum noise has been expressed in terms of the uncertainty in the\nmomentum deposited in the test mass by the tunneling current I0 in a time interval \u03c4 . In practical cases the bias\nvoltage applied to the tunnel junction will be much less than the work function of the tip material so the rectangular\nbarrier is a close approximation to reality. In this case the spectral density of the \"quantum\" force noise is\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n\u0012 \u0013 2 !2\n\u0012 \u00132 !2\nk0\nk0\nI0 2 2 1 \uf8f0\n1+\n\u2212 1\u2212\n(1 \u2212 T )\uf8fb .\n(45)\nSfQ = ~ k\ne\n2\nk\nk\nThe biggest practical obstacle to observing the quantum effects we discuss in this paper is the thermal noise which\nis manifested as the Brownian motion of the test mass. One can describe the Brownian motion of the test mass by\nincluding a Langevin force having a single-sided spectral density\nSfL = 4m(2\u03c0f0 )\n\nkB \u03b8\n.\nQ\n\n(46)\n\nWe assumed in Eq. (46) that the test mass is a mechanical resonator, at a temperature \u03b8, having mass m, frequency\nf0 , and quality factor Q such that the decay time of the free oscillation is Q/\u03c0f0 . To be able to observe the influence\nof the tunneling transducer on the test mass the Langevin force must be smaller than the force fluctuations from the\ntunneling transducer, i.e., SfQ > SfL . This can be expressed in the following practical form:\n10\u22126 A\n\u03b8\nf0 107\nm\n< 1.\nI0 10\u221210 kg 10mK 105 Hz Q\n\n(47)\n\nWe have assumed that k0 = 1010 m\u22121 . The mass, frequency, and Q used in (47) are appropriate to micromachined\nsilicon resonators at low temperatures. The mass of 10\u221210 kg which is assumed above corresponds to a silicon\nstructure like the one shown in Fig. 6. A mechanical quality factor of 6 \u00d7 105 was obtained at room temperature in\na micromachined silicon torsional resonator of mass 7 \u00d7 10\u22126 kg [11], and a more massive resonator, m \u2243 1 g, which\nhad a similar Q at room temperature achieved a Q approaching 108 at 10 mK [12]. A systematic study of acoustic\nlosses of silicon resonators at cryogenic temperatures indicates that the intrinsic Q\u2032 s of silicon are over one billion\n[13]. Therefore we assume that a Q of 107 may be achievable with a 10\u221210 kg mechanical resonator at 10 mK. Atomic\nforce-sensing microcantilevers in this mass range have been fabricated and used at room temperature [14].\nThere are two practical problems which are somewhat eased by working with a mechanical resonator at a frequency\nof 100 kHz. The first is the 1/f noise in the tunneling current. At a frequency of 100 kHz it is likely that the 1/f\nnoise component in the tunneling current should be below the level of the shot noise. Furthermore there should be\nno problems with seismic vibrations and vibration isolation at the frequency of 100 kHz. Two other requirements to\nreach the quantum noise limit with the tunneling transducer are that the noise of the preamplifier used to sense the\n\n\f10\ntunnel current be small in comparison to the shot noise and that the dynamic capacitance of the tunnel probe also be\nsmall. The first requirement, that the amplifier noise be insignificant compared to the tunneling current \u221a\nshot noise,\nis fairly easy to meet. For a tunneling current of 10\u22126 A the shot noise spectral density is 5.7 \u00d7 10\u221213 A/ Hz. This\nis a fairly high noise level compared to the noise of commonly available transistors and operational amplifiers [15].\nThe other requirement is that the dynamical capacitance, i.e., the probe capacitance which changes as the inverse of\nthe tip to test mass gap, be \"small\". Small in this context means low enough to ensure that the back-action force\nassociated with fluctuations in the energy stored in the capacitor is less than the quantum force fluctuations of the\ntunneling current. The specific requirement on the dynamic capacitance have been calculated and values of 10\u221217\nF or smaller are needed to reach the quantum limit [7]. There is also some experimental evidence that the dynamic\ncapacitance of tunnel probes can be in this range [16]. Note that the stray probe capacitance, which may be orders\nof magnitude larger, is not important in this respect because it is only weakly gap dependent.\nIn the realm of conventional, nontunneling transducers, to overcome the two problems just discussed the so-called\nback-action evasion (BAE) techniques have been developed [2]. One example of a BAE strategy which has been\nused on a capacitive transducer coupled to a mechanical harmonic oscillator is to perform phase-sensitive detection.\nThe coupling, i.e., the electric field in the capacitor formed between the transducer and the test mass, is modulated,\nwhich has the consequence that the back-action force acts on one of the phases of the mechanical oscillator while\nthe information which is extracted from the mechanical oscillator reflects the state of the orthogonal phase. It is not\nclear if one can directly apply the phase-sensitive continuous-monitoring BAE techniques to the tunneling transducer\nand circumvent the quantum limit, however, one may be able to use a so-called quantum nondemolition stroboscopic\nmeasurement [2]. In this way, provided that an initial high-sensitivity measurement of the position has been made,\nrepeated measurements made at time intervals of half the period of the mechanical oscillator motion can be performed\nwith the same accuracy as the initial precise measurement. A stroboscopic measurement could be realized by sending\nin short pulses of tunneling current at time intervals equal to one-half of the period of the mechanical oscillator. One\nneeds very short pulses to make an accurate stroboscopic measurement [17]. The duration of each pulse, and therefore\nthe accuracy of the stroboscopic measurement, will be limited by the RC time constant of the tunneling probe so one\nwill have to avoid large stray capacitance of the tunneling probe.\n\nFIG. 6: Design for a silicon micromachined torsional resonator with a resonant frequency of 60 KHz and an effective mass of\n10\u221210 kg.\n\n\f11\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nQuantum-mechanical uncertainties for measurements made on a test mass by a tunneling transducer have been\ncalculated using a first-quantization approach.\nThe possibility of reaching the quantum limit in practical electromechanical devices incorporating a tunneling\nprobe has been discussed, as well as a possible way to surpass the standard quantum limit by means of quantum\nnondemolition stroboscopic techniques.\nin closing the ability to probe a single macroscopic object in the quantum domain opens a fundamental question\nconcerning the validity of the quantum ergodicity assumption. This assumption is that ensemble averaged quantities\nare equivalent to time averages of the same quantity in a single quantum system. The point in our analysis where the\nquantum ergodicity assumption enters is Eq. (44), in which we assert the equivalence of the quantum uncertainties\nwe calculated and the noise spectral densities of the corresponding quantities. All the experiments which probe\nmicroscopic quantum phenomena in which a measurement is made on each member of an ensemble of identically\nprepared systems have outcomes, without exception, which agree with the predictions of quantum mechanics. The\nsort of experiments which should be possible with the tunneling transducer are qualitatively different. One will be\nable to make repeated measurements on a single quantum system which is weakly coupled to its environment. In this\ncase the outcome of the later measurements will depend upon the interaction of the measuring apparatus with the\nsystem during earlier measurements. If the ergodic assumption is true, then the outcome of the experiments discussed\nin this paper should coincide with the quantum predictions obtained by the usual ensemble-averaging technique.\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank G.
