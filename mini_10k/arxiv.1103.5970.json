S. Seshadri on his 80th birthday\nAbstract. We will prove that any weakly-split spherical Tits system (B, N ) in G = G(k) (G a\nquasi-reductive k-group, such as a connected reductive k-group) satisfying some natural conditions\nis \"standard\". In particular, if G is anisotropic over k, then such a Tits system is trivial, i.e.,\nB = G.\n1. Introduction\n1.1. In this paper, k will always be an infinite field, k a fixed algebraic closure of k and ks the\nseparable closure of k in k.\nIt is known that all maximal k-split tori in a smooth connected affine k-group G are G(k)conjugate ([6], Theorem C.2.3). The k-rank of such a G is by definition the dimension of a maximal\nk-split torus of G. We will say that a smooth connected affine k-group is k-isotropic if its k-rank\nis positive, and k-anisotropic if its k-rank is 0.\nA smooth connected unipotent k-group U is said to be k-wound if every map of k-schemes\nA1k \u2192 U is a constant map to a point in U(k). It is obvious from this definition that such a group\ndoes not contain any nontrivial k-split smooth connected k-subgroup. It is known that a k-torus\ncan only act trivially on a k-wound U (see [6], Proposition B.4.4). Therefore, if U is a k-wound\nsmooth connected unipotent normal k-subgroup of a k-group H, then every k-torus of H commutes\nwith U. According to Theorem B.3.4 of [6], any smooth connected unipotent k-group U contains a\nunique k-split smooth connected normal k-subgroup, to be denote by Usplit , such that U/Usplit is\nk-wound. Moreover, this subgroup contains every k-split smooth connected k-subgroup of U, so it\ncan alternatively be described as the unique maximal k-split smooth connected k-subgroup of U.\nTherefore, a smooth connected unipotent k-group is k-wound if it does not contain any nontrivial\nk-split smooth connected k-subgroup.\nThe maximal smooth connected unipotent normal k-subgroup of G is called the k-unipotent\nradical of G; it will be denoted by Ru,k (G). The maximal k-split smooth connected unipotent\nnormal k-subgroup of G is called the k-split unipotent radical of G; it will be denoted by Rus,k (G),\nand is clearly contained in Ru,k (G). By Corollary B.3.5 of [6], the k-split unipotent radical Rus,k (G)\nis the maximal smooth connected k-split subgroup of Ru,k (G), so the quotient Ru,k (G)/Rus,k (G)\nis k-wound.\nA smooth connected affine k group G is said to be pseudo-reductive if its k-unipotent radical\nRu,k (G) is trivial, and is said to be quasi-reductive if its k-split unipotent radical Rus,k (G) is\ntrivial. If G is quasi-reductive then its k-unipotent radical Ru,k (G) equals Ru,k (G)/Rus,k (G), and\nhence is k-wound. Note that the notion of a quasi-reductive group is different from the notion of\na quasi-reductive group scheme over a discrete valuation ring introduced in a joint paper of the\nauthor with Jiu-Kang Yu (in J. Alg. Geom. 15(2006)).\n1\n\n\f2\n\nGiven a smooth connected affine k-group G, G/Ru,k (G) and G/Rus,k (G) are respectively the\nmaximal pseudo-reductive and the maximal quasi-reductive quotients of G. If k is perfect, every\npseudo-reductive and every quasi-reductive k-group is reductive.\nIn the rest of the paper, G will be a quasi-reductive k-group, D(G) will denote its derived\nsubgroup (G, G). Being k-wound, Ru,k (G) commutes with every k-torus of G (Proposition B.4.4\nof [6]). In particular, if S is a maximal k-split torus of G then Ru,k (G) \u2282 ZG (S), so the k-root\nsystem (see C.2.12 in [6]) of G with respect to S is the set of nonzero weights of S on Lie(G).\nThere is a natural bijective correspondence between the set of k-isotropic minimal perfect smooth\nconnected proper normal k-subgroups of G and the set of irreducible components of the k-root\nsystem of G with respect to S; see Proposition C.2.32 in [6].\n1.2. The standard Tits systems in G := G(k) and in certain subgroups of G. Let\nG = G(k) and G+ be the normal subgroup of G generated by the group of k-rational points of the\nk-split unipotent radicals of pseudo-parabolic k-subgroups of G (for definition of pseudo-parabolic\nk-subgroups, see [6], 2.2; in a connected reductive group the pseudo-parabolic k-subgroups are the\nparabolic k-subgroups by Proposition 2.2.9 of [6]). If G is k-isotropic and it does not contain a\nnontrivial perfect smooth connected proper normal k-subgroup, then G+ , and in fact every noncentral normal subgroup of G, is Zariski-dense in G (Theorem C.2.33 of [6]).\nLet S be a maximal k-split torus of G. Let ZG (S) and NG (S) respectively be the centralizer\nand the normalizer of S in G. The finite group k W := NG (S)(k)/ZG (S)(k) is called the k-Weyl\ngroup of G, it is the Weyl group of the k-root system k \u03a6 of G with respect to S.\nFor simplicity, we will denote the k-root system k \u03a6 of G and the k-Weyl group k W by \u03a6 and W\nrespectively in the sequel.\nLet P be a minimal pseudo-parabolic k-subgroup of G containing S. Then P contains the\ncentralizer ZG (S) of S in G ([6], Proposition C.2.4). We fix a subgroup G of G containing G+ such\nthat the identity component of the Zariski-closure of G in G is same as the identity component of\nthe Zariski-closure of G. Let B = P(k) \u2229 G and N = NG (S)(k) \u2229 G . It follows from Proposition\nC.2.23 of [6] that N maps onto the Weyl group W . It has been observed in Remark C.2.24 of\n[6] (using Theorem C.2.19 and Remark C.2.21 of [6]) that (B, N ) is a Tits system in G . The\nWeyl group of this Tits system is W and the rank of this Tits system is equal to the rank of\nthe k-root system \u03a6 of G (which is equal to the k-rank of D(G); see Theorem C.2.14 of [6]).\nWe call this Tits system a standard Tits system in G . (Note that this notion of a standard Tits\nsystem in the abstract group G makes use of the given quasi-reductive algebraic k-group G whose\ngroup of k-rational points contains the group G . But a consequence of Theorem B of this paper is\nthat the notion is to a large extent independent of G.) Conjugacy of maximal k-split tori and of\nminimal pseudo-parabolic k-subgroups in G under G (see Remark C.2.24 of [6]) implies that any\ntwo standard Tits systems in G are conjugate to each other.\nThe Bruhat decomposition for the Tits system (B, N ) of G gives us that G is a disjoint union\nof BwB, w \u2208 W .\nIt turns out, rather surprisingly, that any Tits system in G satisfying some natural conditions is\na standard Tits system. For a precise statement see Theorem B below.\n1.3. From Remark C.2.11 and Lemma 1.2.5 of [6] applied to a maximal k-torus of G containing\nthe given maximal k-split torus S of G, we see that S is an almost direct product of the maximal\n\n\f3\n\nk-split central torus of G and the maximal k-split torus of D(G) contained in S. Thus, D(G) is\nk-anisotropic if and only if S is central. By conjugacy of maximal k-split tori in G, the centrality of\nS is equivalent to the assertion that every k-split torus of G is central. Since, as mentioned above,\nRu,k (G) commutes with every k-torus of G, we easily see that the condition that every k-split\ntorus of G is central is equivalent to the condition that every k-split torus of the maximal pseudoreductive quotient G/Ru,k (G) is central. But according to Lemma 2.2.3 of [6], this latter condition\nis equivalent to the condition that G does not contain proper pseudo-parabolic k-subgroups. Hence\nif every k-split torus of G is central (or, equivalently, if D(G) is k-anisotropic), then G+ is trivial.\n1.4. Let (B, N ) be an arbitrary Tits system in G . Let H = B \u2229 N . Then the Weyl group of this\nTits system is N/H; we will denote it by W T in the sequel. For basic results on Tits systems,\nincluding those recalled in 3.1 below, see [3], Ch. IV.\nLet S be the distinguished set of involutive generators of W T . The rank of the Tits system\n(B, N ) is the cardinality of S. For s \u2208 S, let Gs = B \u222a BsB. Then Gs is a subgroup of G for every\ns \u2208 S.\nWe will say that the Tits system (B, N ) is weakly-split if there exists a nilpotent normal subgroup\nU of T\nB such that B = HU . We will say that the Tits system is split if it is saturated (that is,\nH = n\u2208N nBn\u22121 ) and there exists a nilpotent normal subgroup U of B such that B = H \u22c9 U . As\nRu,k (G) \u2282 ZG (S), the standard Tits system in G with B = P(k) \u2229 G and N = NG (S)(k) \u2229 G is\nsplit, with B = H \u22c9 U , where H = B \u2229 N = ZG (S)(k) \u2229 G and U = Rus,k (P)(k) (see Remarks\nC.2.21 and C.2.24 in [6]).\nIn this paper, we will only work with spherical Tits systems (B, N ) in G (i.e., Tits systems with\nfinite Weyl group). The Tits systems being considered here will often be either weakly-split or\nsplit, and U will be a nilpotent normal subgroup of B as in 1.4.\nThe purpose of this paper is to prove the following two theorems.\nTheorem A. Assume that (i) either G is perfect and quasi-reductive, or it is pseudo-reductive,\n(ii) every k-split torus of G is central (or, equivalently, D(G) is k-anisotropic, cf. 1.3), and (iii) the\nTits system (B, N ) is weakly-split. Then B is of finite index in G . Furthermore, if one of the\nfollowing two conditions hold, then B = G :\n(1) G is reductive.\n(2) G is perfect and quasi-reductive.\nTheorem B. Assume that G is an arbitrary quasi-reductive group, the Tits system (B, N ) is\nweakly-split, and for every s \u2208 S, the index of B in Gs is infinite (or, equivalently, the index of\nB \u2229 sBs\u22121 in B is infinite). Then there exists a pseudo-parabolic k-subgroup P of G such that\nB = P(k) \u2229 G .\nAssume further that the Tits system (B, N ) is saturated and B does not contain a non-central\nnormal subgroup of the group of k-rational points of a k-isotropic minimal perfect smooth connected\nnormal k-subgroup of G. Then (B, N ) is a standard Tits system, namely it is one of the Tits\nsystems given in 1.2 above. In particular, the Tits system is split.\nNote that for the standard Tits system in G , the index of B in Gs is infinite for every s \u2208 S\n(since the field k has been assumed to be infinite). The standard Tits system is saturated and split\n(1.4).\n\n\f4\n\nRemark 1. Regarding the condition in Theorem B that \"B does not contain a non-central normal\nsubgroup of the group of k-rational points of a k-isotropic minimal perfect smooth connected normal\nk-subgroup of G\" we make the following observation: Theorem C.2.32 (2) of [6] implies that the\nintersection of G+ with the group N(k) of k-rational points of a k-isotropic minimal perfect smooth\nconnected normal k-subgroup N of G is a normal subgroup of N(k) that is not central. We also\nmention that N does not contain a nontrivial perfect smooth connected proper k-subgroup that is\nnormal in N (Proposition C.2.32 (4) of [6]), and so by Theorem C.2.33 (3) of [6] every non-central\nnormal subgroup of N(k) is Zariski-dense in N.\nLet G\u2032 be a k-isotropic k-simple connected semi-simple k-group and G\u2032 = G\u2032 (k). Let (B, N )\nbe a weakly-split Tits system in G = G(k). Then (B \u00d7 G\u2032 , N \u00d7 G\u2032 ) is a weakly-split Tits system\nin G \u00d7 G\u2032 . This shows that the condition imposed on B in the second assertion of Theorem B is\nnecessary.\nTheorems A and B hold in particular for G connected reductive, and appear to be new and\ninteresting even for these groups. We recall that there are spherical Moufang buildings which\narise from nonreductive pseudo-reductive groups (see, for example, [13], 10.3.2, or [14], 41.20; the\ngroups appearing in 10.3.2 of [13] are the group of k-rational points of \"exotic\" pseudo-reductive\ngroups described in [6], Ch. 7). Therefore, we have chosen to work in the more general set-up of\nquasi-reductive groups in this paper. Proofs of Theorems A and B given below for G reductive do\nnot require familiarity with the theory of pseudo-reductive and quasi-reductive groups. It would\nbe enough to know the Borel-Tits theory of reductive groups over non-algebraically closed fields\n(as described in [2]) and to know that the pseudo-parabolic k-subgroups of a connected reductive\nk-group are just the parabolic k-subgroups (Proposition 2.2.9 of [6]).\nWe will prove Theorem A in \u00a74 and prove Theorem B, which is the main result of this paper, in\n\u00a75 for Tits systems of rank 1 and in \u00a76 for Tits systems of arbitrary rank.\nSpecial cases of Theorem A were proven earlier in [5] and [1]. Caprace and Marquis proved in\n[5] that if G is semi-simple and k-anisotropic, then B is of finite index in G in case k is either\nperfect or it is a nondiscrete locally compact field. That paper inspired us to write this paper. In\n[1], Abramenko and Zaremsky have proved Theorem A, by an entirely different argument, for some\nclasses of semi-simple groups.\nWe owe the following remark to Richard Weiss.\nRemark 2. Let (B, N ) be a weakly-split spherical Tits system in an abstract group G, and let \u03a9\nbe the building associated to this Tits system. We assume that (i) B acts faithfully on \u03a9, (ii) the\nWeyl group of the Tits system is irreducible, and (iii) the rank of the Tits system is at least 2.\nLet B = HU , with H = B \u2229 N and U a nilpotent normal subgroup of B. Then the building \u03a9 is\nMoufang and U is precisely the subgroup generated by the \"root groups\", of the group Aut(\u03a9) of\ntype-preserving automorphisms of \u03a9, contained in B. This has been proved by De Medts, Haot,\nTent and Van Maldeghem, see the corollary in \u00a72 of [11] (and also [9] and [10]).\nIn the early 1970s, Tits proved that every irreducible thick spherical building of rank > 3 is\nMoufang; see [13], Addenda. Given a semi-simple k-group G, in [13], 11.14, there is an example of\na spherical Tits system (B, N ) in a free group F with infinitely many generators such that B does\nnot contain any nontrivial normal subgroup of F and the building associated to this Tits system\nis the building of the standard Tits system in G(k). As subgroups of F are free, it is obvious\n\n\f5\n\nthat no Tits system in F can be weakly-split. Thus spherical Moufang buildings can arise from\nnon-weakly-split Tits systems.\nRemark 3. Theorem B does not hold in general if k is a finite field and G is a connected reductive\nk-group. To see some examples, let Fp denote the finite field with p elements. As mentioned by\nKatrin Tent, there is a well-known isomorphism between PGL3 (F2 ) and PGL2 (F7 )+ which provides\nsplit Tits systems in PGL3 (F2 ) of ranks 1 and 2. There is also an isomorphism between PU4 (F2 )\nand PSp4 (F3 )+ which provides two non-isomorphic split Tits systems in PU4 (F2 ) of rank 2.\n2. Preliminaries\n2.1. As in Theorems A and B, G is a quasi-reductive k-group. Its k-unipotent radical Ru,k (G) is\nk-wound, so it commutes with every k-torus of G.\nFor a k-subgroup H of G, Hk will denote the k-group obtained from H by extension of scalars\nk \u0592\u2192 k, and Ru (Hk ) will denote the unipotent radical of Hk , i.e., the maximal smooth connected\nunipotent normal k-subgroup of Hk . Let G\u2032 = Gk /Ru (Gk ) be the maximal reductive quotient of\nGk and \u03c0 : Gk \u2192 G\u2032 be the quotient map. For a k-subgroup H of G, we shall denote the image\n\u03c0(Hk ) (\u2286 G\u2032 ) of Hk by H\u2032 .\nFor any smooth affine k-group H, D(H) will denote the derived subgroup (H, H) of H.\n2.2. For any smooth connected affine k-group H, let Ht denote the k-subgroup generated by all\nthe k-tori of H. It is known (see Proposition A.2.11 of [6]) that Ht is a normal subgroup of H,\nH/Ht is a unipotent group, and (Ht )k is the subgroup of Hk generated by all maximal k-tori of the\nlatter. Since H/Ht is a unipotent group, every perfect smooth closed k-subgroup of H is contained\nin Ht , and Ht = H if H is perfect.\nBeing generated by k-tori, Ht is unirational over k, and hence Ht (k) is Zariski-dense in Ht .\nIf Ru,k (H) is k-wound, then it commutes with every k-torus of H, and hence it commutes with\nHt . If, moreover, H is perfect, then as Ht = H, Ru,k (H) is contained in the center of H.\n2.3. The Zariski-closure of G = G(k): Let G\u266e be the identity component of the Zariski-closure\nof G in G. Since Gt (k) is Zariski-dense in Gt (2.2), Gt \u2286 G\u266e . If either G is perfect or reductive,\nthen Gt = G, so in these cases, G\u266e = G; i.e., G(k) is Zariski-dense in G. (Note that Zariski-density\nof G in G may fail if the latter is a commutative pseudo-reductive group, see Example 11.3.1 in\n[6].) Since any perfect smooth connected k-subgroup of G is contained in Gt , any such subgroup\nis contained in G\u266e .\nSince G/Gt is a unipotent group, under the quotient map \u03c0 : Gk \u2192 G\u2032 , the subgroup (Gt )k ,\nand so also Gk\u266e , maps onto the reductive group G\u2032 . This implies that the geometric unipotent\nradical Ru (Gk\u266e ) of G\u266e is contained in the geometric unipotent radical Ru (Gk ) of G, which in turn\nimplies that Ru,k (G\u266e ) \u2286 Ru,k (G) and Rus,k (G\u266e ) \u2286 Rus,k (G). So Rus,k (G\u266e ) is trivial, i.e., G\u266e is\nquasi-reductive, and Ru,k (G\u266e ) is k-wound.\nGiven a k-torus T of G and a k-split smooth connected unipotent k-subgroup U of G, as T(k)\nand U(k) are Zariski-dense in T and U respectively, we see that G\u266e \u2283 T, U. Hence, the root\ngroups and the root systems of G and G\u266e with respect to any maximal k-split torus S are the same\n(see C.2.12 and C.2.20 of [6]), and so the natural homomorphism\nNG\u266e (S)(k)/ZG\u266e (S)(k) \u2212\u2192 NG (S)(k)/ZG (S)(k),\n\n\f6\n\nbetween the k-Weyl groups of G\u266e and G is an isomorphism.\nThe group G\u266e := G\u266e (k) is a normal subgroup of G of finite index, and so it is dense in G\u266e in the\nZariski-topology. Recall that we have assumed that the identity component of the Zariski-closure\nof G in G is same as the identity component of the Zariski-closure of G. So the identity component\nof the Zariski-closure of G in G is G\u266e . The subgroup G \u266e := G\u266e (k) \u2229 G is a normal subgroup of G\nof finite index and so it is also dense in G\u266e in the Zariski-topology.\n2.4. For a quasi-reductive group G, since Ru,k (G) \u2282 ZG (S) for any k-torus S of G, a pseudoparabolic k-subgroup P of G equals PG (\u03bb) (in the notation of [6], 2.1 and 2.2, which we will\nuse here and in the sequel) for a 1-parameter subgroup \u03bb : GL1 \u2192 G. Since \u03bb(GL1 ) \u2282 G\u266e , we\nsee that P\u266e := P \u2229 G\u266e = PG\u266e (\u03bb) is a pseudo-parabolic k-subgroup of G\u266e . Now let P and Q be\ntwo pseudo-parabolic k-subgroups of G and P\u266e := P \u2229 G\u266e , and Q\u266e := Q \u2229 G\u266e . Assume that\nP\u266e = Q\u266e . Let \u03bb and \u03bc be 1-parameter subgroups of G such that P = PG (\u03bb) = ZG (\u03bb) \u22c9 UG (\u03bb)\nand Q = PG (\u03bc) = ZG (\u03bc) \u22c9 UG (\u03bc). As the k-split smooth connected unipotent groups UG (\u03bb) and\nUG (\u03bc) are contained in G\u266e , UG\u266e (\u03bb) = UG (\u03bb) and UG\u266e (\u03bc) = UG (\u03bc). Now since P\u266e = PG\u266e (\u03bb) and\nQ\u266e = PG\u266e (\u03bc), Rus,k (P\u266e ) = UG (\u03bb) = Rus,k (P) and Rus,k (Q\u266e ) = UG (\u03bc) = Rus,k (Q) (Corollary 2.2.5\nof [6]). As P\u266e = Q\u266e , we see that Rus,k (P) = Rus,k (Q). Now Corollary 3.5.10 of [6], applied to\nK = ks , implies that P = Q. In particular, letting P = G, we see that if Q\u266e = G\u266e , then Q = G.\n2.5. Since the multiplication map\nUG\u266e (\u2212\u03bb) \u00d7 ZG\u266e (\u03bb) \u00d7 UG\u266e (\u03bb) \u2212\u2192 G\u266e\nis an open immersion (Proposition 3.1.8 of [6]), and the subgroups UG\u266e (\u2212\u03bb)(k) and UG\u266e (\u03bb)(k) are\ncontained in G \u266e , the Zariski-density of G \u266e in G\u266e implies that ZG\u266e (\u03bb)(k) \u2229 G \u266e and P\u266e (k) \u2229 G \u266e (=\nPG\u266e (\u03bb)(k) \u2229 G \u266e ) are Zariski-dense in ZG\u266e (\u03bb) and P\u266e (= PG\u266e (\u03bb) = ZG\u266e (\u03bb) \u22c9 UG\u266e (\u03bb)) respectively.\nRecall that a 1-parameter subgroup \u03bb of a maximal k-split torus S of G is said to be regular\nif for every root a of G with respect to S, ha, \u03bbi 6= 0, or, equivalently, ZG (\u03bb) = ZG (S). In the\npreceding paragraph, taking \u03bb to be a regular 1-parameter subgroup of a maximal k-split torus S\nof G, we see that ZG\u266e (S)(k) \u2229 G \u266e is Zariski-dense in ZG\u266e (S). Hence, the identity component of the\nZariski-closure of ZG (S)(k) \u2229 G is ZG\u266e (S) (\u2287 S).\nSince P\u266e = P \u2229 G\u266e , we have P\u266e (k) \u2229 G \u266e = P(k) \u2229 G \u266e . Now the Zariski-density of P\u266e (k) \u2229 G \u266e in P\u266e\nimplies that the identity component of the Zariski-closure of P(k) \u2229 G \u266e , and so also of P(k), is P\u266e .\nTherefore, every perfect smooth connected k-subgroup, every k-torus, and every k-split smooth\nconnected unipotent k-subgroup of P is contained in P\u266e . If a is a root of G with respect to a\nmaximal k-split torus S contained in P and a is a weight of S on Lie(P), then as the root group\nUa is contained in P, it is also contained in P\u266e . This implies, in particular, that the weight spaces\nin Lie(P) and Lie(P\u266e ) with respect to S, for a nonzero weight, are identical.\nLet Q be a pseudo-parabolic k-subgroup of G such that Q(k) \u2287 G . Then Q\u266e := Q \u2229 G\u266e equals\nG\u266e , and so Q = G (2.4).\n2.6. We observe here for later use that if P is a pseudo-parabolic k-subgroup of G such that P(k)\u2229G\nis a maximal proper subgroup of G , then P is a maximal proper pseudo-parabolic k-subgroup of\nG. For, if there is a proper pseudo-parabolic k-subgroup Q of G properly containing P, then the\npseudo-parabolic k-subgroup Q\u266e := Q \u2229 G\u266e of G\u266e would properly contain the pseudo-parabolic\nk-subgroup P\u266e := P \u2229 G\u266e of G\u266e (2.4). Now as the identity component of the Zariski-closure of\n\n\f7\n\nP(k)\u2229G (resp. Q(k)\u2229G ) is P\u266e (resp. Q\u266e ), we conclude that P(k)\u2229G 6= Q(k)\u2229G . Hence, Q(k) \u2287 G ,\nwhich implies that Q = G (2.5), a contradiction.\n3. Six basic propositions\n3.1. As in \u00a72, let G be a quasi-reductive k-group, G = G(k). Let (B, N ) be a weakly-split Tits\nsystem in G , with B = HU , H = B \u2229 N . Let W T = N/H be the Weyl group of this Tits system.\nWe assume that the Tits system is spherical, i.e., W T is finite. Let S be the distinguished set of\ninvolutive generators of W T . For a subset X of S, we will denote by WXT the subgroup of W T\ngenerated by the elements in X, and by GX the subgroup BWXT B of G . It is known (as for any\nTits system) that B equals its normalizer in G , so in particular, it contains the center\nT of G . (If the\nTits system (B, N ) is saturated, then the center of G is contained in H since H = n\u2208N nBn\u22121 in\nthat case.) Any subgroup of G containing B equals GX for a unique subset X of S.\n3.2. Notation. As in 2.3, we will denote the identity component of the Zariski-closure of G in\nG by G\u266e . By our assumption, G\u266e is also the identity component of the Zariski-closure of G in G.\nRecall that G\u266e contains Gt . Let B (resp., U) be the identity component of the Zariski-closure of\nB (resp., U ) in G. The subgroups B and U are contained in G\u266e , and U is a connected nilpotent\nnormal k-subgroup of B. Let B0 = B \u2229 B(k). Then B0 is a normal subgroup of B of finite index.\nSince G is the union of finitely many double cosets BwB, w \u2208 W T , finitely many {B0 , B0 }-double\ncosets cover G , which implies that some {B, B}-double coset of a k-point in G\u266e is dense (and\nhence open) in G\u266e . As Gk\u266e maps onto the reductive quotient G\u2032 of Gk (2.3), we see that some\n{B\u2032 , B\u2032 }-double coset is open in G\u2032 .\nWe shall prove six propositions in this section which will be crucial in this paper.\nProposition 1. The following hold:\n(i) The unique maximal k-torus of U is contained in the center of G.\n(ii) If U is contained in D(G), then it is unipotent.\nProof. Let T be the unique maximal k-torus of the smooth connected nilpotent k-subgroup U.\nThen T is normal, and hence central, in the connected group B. This implies that B is contained\nin the centralizer M := ZG (T) of T in G. But then B\u2032 \u2286 M\u2032 = ZG\u2032 (T\u2032 ). Note that M\u2032 , being the\ncentralizer of a torus in the connected reductive group G\u2032 , is a connected reductive subgroup. As\nsome {B\u2032 , B\u2032 }-double coset in G\u2032 is open, some {M\u2032 , M\u2032 }-double coset in the reductive group G\u2032\nis open. By Proposition 1.6 of [4] then M\u2032 = G\u2032 , i.e., T\u2032 is central in G\u2032 . Hence, the commutator\nsubgroup (G, T)k is contained in the geometric unipotent radical Ru (Gk ) of G. So the smooth\nconnected k-subgroup (G, T) is contained in the k-unipotent radical Ru,k (G); i.e., T commutes\nwith G modulo Ru,k (G). Therefore (see Corollary 2 in [2], \u00a711.14), under the natural projection\nG \u2192 G/Ru,k (G), ZG (T) maps onto G/Ru,k (G), hence G = ZG (T)Ru,k (G). But since Ru,k (G)\nis a k-wound unipotent normal subgroup of G, it commutes with the torus T. This implies that\nG = ZG (T); i.e., T is contained in the center of G. This proves the first assertion of the proposition.\nTo prove the second assertion, assume that U \u2282 D(G). Then T\u2032 \u2282 D(G\u2032 ). But D(G\u2032 ) is a\nconnected semi-simple group, so it does not contain any nontrivial central tori. This implies that\n\n\f8\n\nT\u2032 = \u03c0(Tk ) is trivial. As the kernel of \u03c0 is a unipotent group, we conclude that T is trivial and\nhence U is unipotent. This proves the second assertion.\n\u0003\nProposition 2. Assume that either G is perfect (and quasi-reductive) or it is pseudo-reductive. If\nthe image U\u2032 of Uk in G\u2032 is central, then U is central in G and B is of finite index in G .\nProof. Let us assume first that G is perfect and quasi-reductive. Then U is unipotent (Proposition\n1(ii). Now if the unipotent group U\u2032 is central in the reductive group G\u2032 , then it is trivial. This\nimplies that Uk is contained in Ru (Gk ) and hence U \u2286 Ru,k (G). But in a perfect quasi-reductive\ngroup G, Ru,k (G) is central (2.2), so U is central.\nNow let us assume that G is an arbitrary pseudo-reductive group and U\u2032 is central in G\u2032 . Then\nthe commutator subgroup (G, U)k is contained in Ru (Gk ), and so (G, U) \u2286 Ru,k (G). But as G\nhas been assumed to be pseudo-reductive, its k-unipotent radical Ru,k (G) is trivial, so (G, U) is\ntrivial and hence U is central.\nIf U is central in G, then U(k), which contains a subgroup of U of finite\nindex, is S\ncentral in G, so\nS\nU is virtually central in G . Now from the Bruhat decomposition G = n\u2208N BnB = n\u2208N U nB, we\nsee that if U is virtually central (in G ), then B is of finite index in G . This proves the proposition.\n\u0003\nProposition 3. Assume that for every s \u2208 S, the index of B in Gs is infinite. Let Vk be a smooth\nconnected unipotent k-subgroup of Gk which is normalized by B. Let V := Vk (k) \u2229 G inside G(k).\nThen V is contained in B.\nProof. We consider the subgroup BV = V B of G . As it contains B, it equals GX for a subset X of\nS. To prove that V is contained in B, we need to show that X is empty. Let us assume that this\nis not the case, and fix an s \u2208 X. Let Vs = V \u2229 Gs . Then BVs = HU Vs = Gs , and, in particular,\nVs is not contained in B. The pair (B, Ns := N \u2229 Gs ) is a Tits system in Gs of rank 1. Let B be\nthe building associated with this Tits system. B is just the infinite set Gs /B endowed with the\nleft-multiplication action of Gs . Any pair of distinct points in this building constitute an apartment.\nLet x and x\u2032 be the points of B fixed by B and B \u2032 = sBs\u22121 respectively. Then H (\u2286 B \u2229 sBs\u22121 )\nfixes both x and x\u2032 and s interchanges them. As Gs (= U Vs H) operates transitively on the set of\napartments of B, we see that it acts 2-transitively on B. Since H fixes x and x\u2032 , we conclude that\nthe subgroup U Vs is 2-transitive on B. Now we recall that according to Proposition 1(i), the unique\nmaximal k-torus of the connected nilpotent subgroup U is contained in the center of G. Therefore,\nUk Vk is a nilpotent subgroup of Gk . Hence the subgroup U V , and so also the subgroup U Vs , is\nvirtually nilpotent. By the following lemma, which was pointed out to the author by Katrin Tent,\nsuch a group cannot act 2-transitively on an infinite set. Thus we have arrived at a contradiction.\nThis proves that V is contained in B.\n\u0003\nLemma 1. A virtually nilpotent group cannot act 2-transitively on an infinite set.\nProof (by Katrin Tent). We will prove the lemma by contradiction. Let H be a virtually nilpotent\ngroup which acts 2-transitively on an infinite set X . After replacing H with its quotient by the\nkernel of the action, we may (and do) assume that the action is faithful. Then any nontrivial\ncommutative normal subgroup of H acts simply transitively on X . Let N be a nilpotent normal\nsubgroup of H of finite index and C(N ) be its center. Then C(N ) is a nontrivial commutative\nnormal subgroup of H , so it acts simply transitively on X , in particular, C(N ) is infinite. Fix\n\n\f9\n\nan x \u2208 X and let Hx be the stabilizer of x in H . We identify X with C(N ) using the bijection\ng 7\u2192 gx. With this identification, the action of Hx on X is just the conjugation action (of Hx ) on\nC(N ). As Hx acts transitively on X \u2212 {x}, we conclude that the conjugation action of Hx on\nC(N ) is transitive on the set of nontrivial elements of C(N ). But since N is of finite index in H ,\nthe orbit of any element of C(N ) under H , and hence under Hx , is finite. This is a contradiction.\n\u0003\nFor an arbitrary quasi-reductive group G, we have the following converse of Proposition 2.\nProposition 4. Assume that the index of B in G , as well as in Gs for every s \u2208 S, is infinite.\nThen the image U\u2032 of Uk in G\u2032 is not central.\nProof. Applying Proposition 3 to the smooth connected normal subgroup Vk := Ru (Gk ) of Gk\nwe see that V := Ru (Gk )(k) \u2229 G is contained in B. Note that the kernel of the map \u03c0 : Gk \u2192\nG\u2032 = Gk /Ru (Gk ) restricted to G \u2286 G = G(k) (\u2282 G(k)) is V . As the subgroup Gk\u266e maps onto\nG\u2032 , and a subgroup of G is Zariski-dense in G\u266e , the image of G in G\u2032 (k) is Zariski-dense in G\u2032 .\nSo U V /V is virtually central in G /V (i.e., a subgroup of U V /V of finite index is central in G /V )\nif and only if the image U\u2032 of Uk in G\u2032 is central. Now assume, if possible, that U\u2032 is central in\nG\u2032 , or,\ncentral in G /V , then, from the Bruhat decomposition\nS\nS U V /V is virtually\nS equivalently, that\nG = w\u2208W T BwB = w\u2208W T U wB = w\u2208W T U V wB, we see at once that B/V is of finite index in\nG /V , and hence B is of finite index in G , a contradiction.\n\u0003\nProposition 5. Assume that the index of B in G is infinite and one of the following two conditions\nhold: (1) either G is perfect (and quasi-reductive) or it is pseudo-reductive; (2) G is quasi-reductive\nand the index of B in Gs is infinite for every s \u2208 S. Then the commutator subgroup (B, U) contains\na nontrivial k-split smooth connected unipotent subgroup. In particular, then Rus,k (B) is nontrivial.\nProof. According to Proposition 2 and the preceding proposition, U\u2032 cannot be central in G\u2032 .\nSince T\u2032 is central in G\u2032 (Proposition 1(i)), but U\u2032 is not, we conclude that T\u2032 6= U\u2032 , and hence\nthe unipotent radical Ru (U\u2032 ) of U\u2032 is nontrivial. If U is central in B, then U\u2032 , and so also Ru (U\u2032 ),\nis central in B\u2032 . We assert that B\u2032 cannot contain a nontrivial smooth unipotent central subgroup.\nFor, otherwise, B\u2032 (k) would contain a nontrivial unipotent element z which is central (in B\u2032 ).\nThe reduced centralizer C\u2032z of z in G\u2032 would then contain B\u2032 . As some {B\u2032 , B\u2032 }-double coset in\nG\u2032 is open, some {C\u2032z , C\u2032z }-double coset is open too. But it has been shown by Martin Liebeck\nthat for no nontrivial unipotent element z \u2208 G\u2032 (k), a {C\u2032z , C\u2032z }-double coset can be open in G\u2032\n([8], Ch. 1, Cor. 8). This proves our assertion. So we conclude that U cannot be central in B.\nThen the commutator subgroup (B, U) is a nontrivial smooth connected normal k-subgroup of B.\nWe claim that this subgroup is unipotent. To verify this claim, we consider the maximal reductive\nquotient Bred := Bk /Ru (Bk ) of Bk . The image of the smooth connected nilpotent normal subgroup\n(B, U)k of Bk in Bred is a smooth connected nilpotent normal subgroup contained in the (semisimple) derived subgroup of Bred , so it is trivial. This implies that (B, U)k \u2286 Ru (Bk ), and hence\n(B, U) is unipotent, as claimed.\nWe will prove that (B, U) contains a nontrivial k-split smooth connected k-subgroup. Then the\nconjugates of this k-split subgroup of (B, U) under B(ks ) generate a smooth connected k-subgroup\nwhich, being contained in (B, U), is unipotent; it is clearly a normal subgroup of B and Theorem\nB.3.4 of [6] implies that it is k-split, hence Rus,k (B) is nontrivial.\n\n\f10\n\nAs we will not need to work with the original U anymore, for simplicity we will denote the\nsmooth connected unipotent normal k-subgroup (B, U) of B by U in the rest of this proof, and U\u2032\nwill now denote the image of (B, U)k in G\u2032 . Let us assume, if possible, that U does not contain\nany nontrivial k-split smooth connected subgroup. Then U is k-wound, and hence every k-torus of\nB commutes with it. This implies that the subgroup Bt of B generated by k-tori commutes with\nU. But then every k-torus of Bk commutes with Uk since according to Proposition A.2.11 of [6],\n(Bt )k is the subgroup of Bk generated by all the k-tori in Bk .\nWe will now show that B\u2032 contains a nontrivial smooth connected unipotent subgroup in its\ncenter, contradicting what we showed above, so this will prove Proposition 5. Let us fix a Borel\nsubgroup S\u2032 \u22c9 V\u2032 of B\u2032 , with S\u2032 a maximal k-torus and V\u2032 the unipotent radical of the Borel\nsubgroup. Note that as U\u2032 is a smooth connected unipotent normal subgroup of B\u2032 it is contained\nin V\u2032 . Now we inductively define, for each positive integer i, the normal subgroups Vi\u2032 of V\u2032\n\u2032\nbe the commutator\ncontained in U\u2032 as follows. Let V1\u2032 = U\u2032 , and having defined Vi\u2032 , let Vi+1\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nsubgroup (V , Vi ). Let n be the largest integer such that Vn is nontrivial. Then Vn\u2032 is a nontrivial\nsmooth connected subgroup of U\u2032 which commutes with V\u2032 . Since every k-torus of Bk commutes\nwith Uk , the k-torus S\u2032 of B\u2032 commutes with U\u2032 , and hence also with the subgroup Vn\u2032 . Thus the\nBorel subgroup S\u2032 \u22c9 V\u2032 of B\u2032 commutes with the subgroup Vn\u2032 , which implies that Vn\u2032 is central\nin B\u2032 (by Corollary 11.4 of [2]).\n\u0003\nProposition 6. Under the hypothesis of the preceding proposition, there exists a proper pseudoparabolic k-subgroup P of G such that (a) the k-split unipotent radical Rus,k (P) of P contains\nRus,k (B) and (b) B \u2286 P := P(k).\nProof. According to the preceding proposition, Rus,k (B) is nontrivial. Since Ru,k (G) is k-wound,\nthe image V of Rus,k (B) in the pseudo-reductive quotient G := G/Ru,k (G) is a nontrivial k-split\nsmooth connected unipotent subgroup which is normalized by the image B of B in G := G(k).\nSo by Theorem C.3.8 of [6], there exists a proper pseudo-parabolic k-subgroup P of G such that\nV \u2286 Rus,k (P) and B \u2286 P(k). We can choose a 1-parameter subgroup \u03bb : GL1 \u2192 G such that\nfor the induced 1-parameter subgroup \u03bb : GL1 \u2192 G, P = PG (\u03bb). Now take P to be the pseudoparabolic subgroup PG (\u03bb) of G (cf. 2.4). This pseudo-parabolic subgroup clearly has the required\nproperties.\n\u0003\nRemark 4. Proposition 1.6 of [4] and Corollary 8 of [8, Ch. 1] used in the proof of Propositions 1 and\n5 are implied by the following general result proved by Guralnick, Malle and Tiep independently\nand by a simple direct argument: Let G be a connected semi-simple group over an algebraically\nclosed field K, x a noncentral element of G(K), Cx the reduced centralizer of x in G, then no\n{Cx , Cx }-double coset can be dense in G. See Corollary 5.5 in [7].\n4. Proof of Theorem A\nWe will continue to use the notation introduced in 3.1 and 3.2.\nProof of Theorem A. We begin by observing that since in Theorem A, it has been assumed\nthat every k-split torus of G is central (equivalently, D(G) is k-anisotropic), G does not contain\na proper pseudo-parabolic k-subgroup, see 1.3. But according to Proposition 6, in case B is of\n\n\f11\n\ninfinite index in G , and either G is perfect (and quasi-reductive) or it is pseudo-reductive, G does\ncontain a proper pseudo-parabolic k-subgroup. Therefore, B must be of finite index in G .\nWe will assume now that either G is perfect and quasi-reductive, or G is reductive. In both\nthe cases, G (and hence G ) is Zariski-dense in G. As B is of finite index in G , B is also Zariskidense in G. Hence, the Zariski-closure U U of U (which is normalized by B) is a nilpotent smooth\nnormal k-subgroup of G. Its identity component U is then a nilpotent smooth connected normal\nk-subgroup of G. If G is reductive, such a subgroup is central. On the other hand, if G is perfect,\nby Proposition 1(ii), U is unipotent, so it is contained in the k-unipotent radical Ru,k (G). But\nif G is perfect and quasi-reductive, Ru,k (G) is central (2.2). Thus, in this case also, U is central.\nThe centrality of U U in G, and so of U in G , follows in both the cases now from Lemma 5.3.2 of\n[6] using the centrality of U in G.\nNow as N normalizes H and U is central, B = HU is normalized by N and hence by G which\nis generated by B \u222a N . Therefore, B is a normal subgroup of G . But the normalizer of B equals\nB which implies that B = G .\n\u0003\nA Tits system of rank 1 in SL1 (D): Let F be a field. Then F\u00d7 acts on F by multiplication, and\nwe form the semi-direct product G := F \u22ca F\u00d7 . The solvable group G admits a split Tits system\n(B, N ) of rank 1 with B = {(0, x)| x \u2208 F\u00d7 } and N = {(\u22121, \u22121), (0, 1)}.\nNow let D be the division algebra with center the 2-adic field Q2 and of dimension d2 over\nQ2 . Let F be the field extension of degree d of the field with 2 elements. Let G = SL1,D . Then\nG is an absolutely simple simply connected algebraic group defined and anisotropic over Q2 , and\nG := G(Q2 ) is the subgroup SL1 (D) of D \u00d7 consisting of elements of reduced norm 1. Let G2 be the\n\"second congruence subgroup\" of G as in [12], 1.1. Then G/G2 \u2243 G = F \u22ca F\u00d7 ([12], \u00a71). Hence, G\nadmits a spherical Tits system of rank 1. Such a Tits system cannot be weakly-split (cf. Theorem\nA).\n5. Proof of Theorem B when the Tits system is of rank 1\n5.1. Since Theorem B is of special interest in case the Tits system is of rank 1, and the proof is\nsimpler than in the general case, we first prove it for Tits systems of rank 1. The proof of Theorem\nB for Tits systems of arbitrary rank will be given in the next section; it will use results proved in\nthis section.\nWe will assume in this section that the Tits system (B, N ) in G is weakly-split, and of rank 1\n(i.e., S = {s}) with, as before, B = HU , H = B \u2229 N and U is a nilpotent normal subgroup of B.\nWe will also assume that the index of B in G is infinite. To prove Theorem B (for Tits systems\nof rank 1), we need to prove that (1) there exists a (proper) pseudo-parabolic k-subgroup P of G\nsuch that B = P(k) \u2229 G , and (2) if the Tits system (B, N ) is saturated and B does not contain\na non-central normal subgroup of the group of k-rational points of a k-isotropic minimal perfect\nsmooth connected normal k-subgroup of G, then the Tits system is a standard Tits system, i.e.,\nit is as in 1.2. Hence the Tits system is split (possibly, in terms of a different decomposition of B;\nsee, however, Proposition 8 below).\nAs the index of B in G has been assumed to be infinite, by Proposition 6, there is a proper\npseudo-parabolic k-subgroup P of G such that B \u2286 P := P(k). Since P is a proper pseudoparabolic k-subgroup of G, P cannot contain G (2.5). Since the Tits system is of rank 1, any\n\n\f12\n\nsubgroup of G which properly contains B equals G . Hence, P \u2229 G = B, and P is a maximal proper\npseudo-parabolic k-subgroup of G (2.6). This proves assertion (1).\nThe proof of assertion (2) requires Proposition 7 given below, whose proof in turn requires the\nfollowing lemma. We first fix some notation. Let \u03a8 be an irreducible root system of rank > 1,\ngiven with a basis \u2206. Let W be the Weyl group of \u03a8 and R = {ra | a \u2208 \u2206}, where for a root a, ra\nis the reflection in a; R is a set of involutive generators of W . We now fix a root a \u2208 \u2206. Let \u03a8\u2032 be\nthe root subsystem of \u03a8 spanned by \u2206 \u2212 {a} (i.e., \u03a8\u2032 is the intersection of the Q-span of \u2206 \u2212 {a}\nwith \u03a8) and W \u2032 (\u2282 W ) be the Weyl group of \u03a8\u2032 ; W \u2032 is generated by the subset R \u2212 {ra }. The\nlength of an element w \u2208 W , in terms of the generating set R of W , will be denoted by l(w). Let\nw0 and w0\u2032 be the longest elements of W and W \u2032 respectively. Both these elements are of order 2.\nIf \u03a8 is of type Am and a is one of the end roots of \u2206 then #W \u2032 \\W/W \u2032 = 2, as can be easily\nverified (see the example in 5.3 below). On the other hand, we have the following:\nLemma 2. Let us assume that the root system \u03a8 is of rank m > 1. Then #W \u2032 \\W/W \u2032 > 2 unless\nthe root system is of type Am and a is one of the two end roots of \u2206.\nProof. If the root system is not reduced (then it is of type BCm ), the subset \u03a8\u2022 consisting of\nnondivisible roots of \u03a8 is a root system of type Bm with Weyl group W , and \u2206 is a basis of \u03a8\u2022 .\nTherefore, to prove the lemma, we may (and do) replace \u03a8 by \u03a8\u2022 and assume that \u03a8 is reduced\n(and irreducible). We will denote by \u03a8+ the positive system of roots determined by the basis \u2206.\nLet us first consider the case where w0 = \u22121 (this is the case unless the root system \u03a8 is\nof type Am (m > 1), Dm , with m odd, or E6 ) and assume for the sake of contradiction that\n#W \u2032 \\W/W \u2032 6 2. Then, clearly, W = W \u2032 \u222a W \u2032 ra W \u2032 , and we conclude that w0 = \u22121 = w1 ra w2 ,\nwith w1 , w2 \u2208 W \u2032 . Then \u2212ra = w1\u22121 w2 \u22121 . As a is the only positive root which is transformed\ninto a negative root by ra , we see that w1\u22121 w2 \u22121 (\u2208 W \u2032 ) takes all the roots in \u03a8\u2032 + := \u03a8\u2032 \u2229 \u03a8+ into\nnegative roots. Therefore, (w2 w1 )\u22121 = w0\u2032 . Hence, w2 = w0\u2032 w1\u22121 , and so l(w2 ) = l(w0\u2032 ) \u2212 l(w1 ). But\nthen l(w0 ) = l(w1 ra w2 ) 6 l(w1 ) + 1 + l(w2 ) = l(w0\u2032 ) + 1. Since 2l(w0 ) = #\u03a8 and 2l(w0\u2032 ) = #\u03a8\u2032 ,\nwe obtain the bound #\u03a8 6 #\u03a8\u2032 + 2. But it is easily seen that this bound does not hold.\nThe following argument to prove the lemma in case w0 6= \u22121, and more generally if the root\nsystem \u03a8 is simply laced, was kindly provided by John Stembridge.\nWe will assume now that the root system \u03a8 is simply laced, is of rank m > 1, and if it is of\ntype Am then a is not an end root of \u2206. If a is not an end root (i.e., if it is connected to at least\n2 simple roots) we set i = 1, a1 = a, and pick any two simple roots to which a is connected and\ncall them a2 and a3 . On the other hand, if a is an end root (then \u03a8 is one of the following types:\nDm , m > 4, E6 , E7 , E8 ) let b be the unique simple root which is connected to three other simple\nroots. Let a1 = a, a2 , . . . , ai = b be the nodes on the shortest path joining a to b in the Dynkin\ngraph of \u2206, and let ai+1 and ai+2 be the two simple roots, other than ai\u22121 , connected to b = ai .\nFor j 6 i + 2, let rj = raj . Then r1 r2 , r2 r3 , . . . , ri\u22121 ri , ri ri+1 , and ri ri+2 all have order 3.\nLet w = r1 r2 * * * ri * ri+1 ri+2 * ri * * * r2 r1 \u2208 W . By considering the monoid of words in S modulo\nsubstitutions according to the braid relations and s2 = 1, for s \u2208 S, it follows from Proposition\n5 in \u00a71.5 of Ch. IV of [3] that any expression in S for an element of W is brought to a reduced\nexpression via such substitutions and that any two reduced expressions are converted into each\nother exclusively by substitution using the braid relations. Thus, the given expression for w is\n\n\f13\n\nreduced and the only other reduced expression for w is the one obtained by interchanging the\ncommuting ri+1 and ri+2 (note that ai+1 cannot be connected to ai+2 since both are connected to\nai ). Hence, w is of length 2i + 2 and it has exactly two reduced expressions, both of them begin and\nend with r1 = ra . We now claim that the double coset W \u2032 wW \u2032 is distinct from W \u2032 and W \u2032 r1 W \u2032\n(so #W \u2032 \\W/W \u2032 > 2). If w belongs to W \u2032 then there is reduced expression for w which is free of\nr1 , and if it belongs to W \u2032 r1 W \u2032 , then it has a reduced expression in which either the first or the\nlast term is different from r1 , a contradiction.\n\u0003\nIn the next proposition, which will be used again in the next section, we assume that the Tits\nsystem (B, N ) in G is weakly-split and of rank 1, but we do not assume that it is saturated. Let\nP be a pseudo-parabolic k-subgroup of G, P = P(k), and assume that B = P \u2229 G . Then we have\nthe following:\nProposition 7. The pseudo-parabolic k-subgroup P contains all k-isotropic minimal perfect smooth\nconnected normal k-subgroups of G except one. The one not contained in P is of k-rank 1.\nProof. As in 2.3 let G\u266e be the identity component of the Zariski-closure of G in G. It is a quasireductive k-subgroup of G, P\u266e = P \u2229 G\u266e is a pseudo-parabolic k-subgroup of G\u266e , and G \u266e :=\nG\u266e (k) \u2229 G is of finite index in G . Any perfect smooth connected k-subgroup of G is contained\nin G\u266e (2.3) and every k-torus and every k-split smooth connected unipotent k-subgroup of P is\ncontained in P\u266e (2.4). So, in particular, S \u2282 P\u266e .\nWe fix a minimal pseudo-parabolic k-subgroup P0 contained in P and a maximal k-split torus S\nof G contained in P0 . Then P0 = ZG (S)\u22c9 Rus,k (P0 ) (Proposition C.2.4 and Corollary 2.2.5 of [6]).\nWe will denote the k-Weyl group NG (S)(k)/ZG (S)(k) of the quasi-reductive k-group G by W . Let\nP0 = P0 (k), Z = ZG (S)(k), P0 = P0 \u2229 G and N = NG (S)(k) \u2229 G . Since Rus,k (P0 )(k) \u2282 G+ \u2286 G ,\nP0 = P0 Z. Hence, for all n \u2208 N , P0 nP0 = P0 nP0 Z. We recall from 1.2 that N\nS maps onto\nW . So we see using the Bruhat decomposition of G with respect to P0 (that is G = n\u2208N P0 nP0 ,\nTheorem C.2.8 of [6]) that G = G Z. Hence, P = (P \u2229 G )Z = BZ.\nLet \u03a6 be the set of k-roots of G with respect to the maximal k-split torus S, \u03a6+ (\u2282 \u03a6) be the\npositive system of roots and \u2206 the set of simple roots determined by the minimal pseudo-parabolic\nk-subgroup P0 . Let R = {ra | a \u2208 \u2206}, where for a \u2208 \u2206, ra \u2208 W is the reflection in a. Then R is a\nset of involutive generators of W ; the lengths of elements in W will be in terms of the generating set\nR. Let w0 be the longest element of W . For a subset Z of R, we will denote by WZ the subgroup\nof W generated by the elements in Z. Let X be the subset of R such that P = P0 WX P0 . Then\nsince P is a maximal proper pseudo-parabolic k-subgroup of G, X = R \u2212 {ra }, for an a \u2208 \u2206. Let\n\u2206a be the connected component of \u2206 containing a, and \u03a8 the irreducible component of \u03a6 spanned\nby \u2206a . Since P \u2287 P0 \u2283 ZG (S) and the set of nonzero weights of S on Lie(P) contains all the\nconnected components of \u03a6 except \u03a8, it is clear that P contains all k-isotropic minimal perfect\nsmooth connected normal k-subgroup of G except the one whose root system with respect to S\nis \u03a8 (see Proposition C.2.32 of [6]). Let Y be the set of reflections in the roots contained in \u2206a ,\nand Y \u2032 = Y \u2212 {ra }; WY is clearly the Weyl group of the root system \u03a8. Since \u2206a is orthogonal\nto \u2206 \u2212 \u2206a , W = WY \u00d7 WR\u2212Y . Now as G = B \u222a BsB and B \u2286 P , G (so also G = G Z, as\nZ \u2282 P0 \u2286 P ) is contained in the union of two {P, P }-double cosets. From this we infer using the\nBruhat decomposition (Theorem C.2.8 of [6]) that W is the union of two {WX , WX }-double cosets,\nand hence WY is the union of two {WY \u2032 , WY \u2032 }-cosets. (Therefore, WY = WY \u2032 \u222a WY \u2032 ra WY \u2032 .)\n\n\f14\n\nWe shall now show that \u03a8 is of rank 1 using the fact that the Tits system under consideration is\nweakly-split. Assume, if possible, that \u03a8 is of rank m > 1. As WY is the union of two {WY \u2032 , WY \u2032 }cosets, from Lemma 2 we conclude that \u03a8 is of type Am (so \u03a8 is reduced), and a is one of the two\nend roots of the basis \u2206a of this root system. Since W = WY \u00d7 WR\u2212Y and WY = WY \u2032 \u222a WY \u2032 ra WY \u2032 ,\nwe obtain that W = WX \u222a WX ra WX , and then w0 will have to belong to WX ra WX which implies\nthat WX ra WX = WX w0 WX . Hence, G = P \u222a P w0 P . As the Weyl group of the Tits system\n(B = P \u2229 G , N ) is {1, s}, H \u2286 B \u2229 sBs\u22121 \u2286 P \u2229 gP g\u22121 for some g \u2208 P w0 P . Therefore, H is\ncontained in p(P \u2229 w0 P w0\u22121 )p\u22121 for some p \u2208 P . Let p = xz, with x \u2208 B and z \u2208 Z. Then\np(P \u2229 w0 P w0\u22121 )p\u22121 = x(P \u2229 w0 P w0\u22121 )x\u22121 . We will show below that if \u03a8 is the root system of type\nAm with m > 1 and a is an end root of its basis \u2206a , then there cannot exist a nilpotent normal\nsubgroup U of B = P \u2229 G and a subgroup H of B which is contained in x(P \u2229 w0 P w0\u22121 )x\u22121 , for\nsome x \u2208 B, such that B = HU . This will prove the proposition.\nSuppose there exist such H and U . Let U be the identity component of the Zariski-closure of\nU . Then as P\u266e is the identity component of the Zariski-closure of P \u2229 G \u266e in G, and so also that\nof B = P \u2229 G , cf. 2.5, and U is a nilpotent normal subgroup of B, we see that U is a nilpotent\nnormal subgroup of P\u266e . Now we note that by Proposition 3.5.12 (1) of [6], Q\u266e := P\u266e \u2229 w0 P\u266e w0\u22121 is\na smooth connected k-subgroup. It clearly contains S. Since H is contained in x(P \u2229 w0 P w0\u22121 )x\u22121\nfor some x \u2208 B and P\u266e is the identity component of the Zariski-closure of P in G (2.5), the identity\ncomponent of the Zariski-closure of H in G is contained in xQ\u266e x\u22121 for an x \u2208 B. From this we\nobtain, using again the fact that P\u266e is the identity component of the Zariski-closure of B = HU\nin G, that P\u266e = xQ\u266e x\u22121 U. Since B normalizes both P\u266e and U and x lies in B, we conclude that\nP\u266e = Q\u266e U. As the root system \u03a8 is reduced, we now see from Proposition 3.3.5 of [6] that if an\nelement of \u03a8 is a weight of S on Lie(P\u266e ), then it is a weight on either Lie(Q\u266e ) or Lie(U).\nTo determine the weights of S on Lie(P\u266e ) and Lie(Q\u266e ) contained in \u03a8, we enumerate the roots\nin \u2206a as {a1 , a2 , . . . , am } so that a1 = a and for i 6 m \u2212 1, ai is not orthogonal to ai+1 , i.e., the\ncorresponding nodes are connected in the Coxeter graph. Then w0 (ai ) = \u2212am+1\u2212i for all i 6 m.\nThe weights of S on Lie(P\u266e ) which belong to \u03a8 are all the roots in \u03a8+ := \u03a8 \u2229 \u03a6+ , and also all the\nnegative roots contained in the span of {a2 , . . . , am }. The weights of S on Lie(w0 P\u266e w0\u22121 ) contained\nin \u03a8 are all the roots in \u2212\u03a8+ , and also all the positive roots contained in the span of {a1 , . . . , am\u22121 }.\nFrom this we see that the weights of S on Lie(P\u266e ) which lie in \u03a8, but are not weights on Lie(Q\u266e ),\nare the m roots ai + * * * + am , with i > 1. These m roots must therefore be weights of S on Lie(U).\nNote that for i > 2, \u2212(ai + * * * + am ) is a weight on Lie(Q\u266e ). Now for a root b \u2208 \u03a8, let Ub be\nthe corresponding root group (see C.2.20 of [6]); Ub is the largest smooth connected unipotent\nk-subgroup of G\u266e normalized by S on whose Lie algebra the only weight of S is b. If b \u2208 \u03a8 is a\nweight of S on Lie(Q\u266e ), then Ub is contained in both P\u266e and w0 P\u266e w0\u22121 and so it is contained in\nQ\u266e = P\u266e \u2229 w0 P\u266e w0\u22121 . On the other hand, if b \u2208 \u03a8 is a nonzero weight of S on Lie(P\u266e ) which is not\na weight on Lie(Q\u266e ), then it must be a weight on Lie(U) and the root group Ub is contained in U.\nLet now b = a2 + * * * + am . Then \u2212b is a weight of S on Lie(Q\u266e ), so U\u2212b \u2282 Q\u266e , and b is not a weight\nof S on Lie(Q\u266e ) so it is a weight on Lie(U) and Ub \u2282 U. Since U is a (connected nilpotent) normal\nsubgroup of P\u266e , it is normalized by U\u2212b , and hence U\u2212b U is a solvable subgroup (U\u2212b U is in fact\nnilpotent since according to Proposition 1(i) the unique maximal torus of the nilpotent group U is\ncontained in the center of G). But the subgroup U\u2212b U contains the subgroup G\u266eb generated by\nU\u00b1b which is a nonsolvable group (nonsolvability of G\u266eb can be seen by considering the image of\n\n\f15\n\n(G\u266eb )k in the reductive group G\u2032 = Gk /Ru (Gk ); this image is isomorphic to either SL2 or PGL2 ).\nThis is impossible, so we are done.\n\u0003\n5.2. To prove assertion (2) of 5.1, we will assume now that the Tits system (B, N ) is saturated\nand B does not contain a non-central normal subgroup of the group of k-rational points of a kisotropic minimal perfect smooth connected normal k-subgroup of G. Then it follows from the first\nobservation in Remark 1, Proposition 7, the description of pseudo-parabolic k-subgroups of G and\nProposition C.2.32 of [6] that P does not contain any k-isotropic perfect smooth connected normal\nk-subgroups of G and the k-rank of D(G) is 1. Hence P is a minimal pseudo-parabolic k-subgroup\nof G. It is known that for g \u2208 G, P \u2229 gPg\u22121 contains the centralizer of a maximal k-split torus\nof G (Proposition C.2.7 of [6]); moreover, since D(G) is of k-rank 1, we easily see that any two\ndistinct minimal pseudo-parabolic k-subgroups of G are opposed to each other. Therefore, for any\ng\u2208\n/ P , as gP g \u22121 6= P (recall that P equals its normalizer in G), gPg \u22121 is different from P, and so\nit is opposed to P. Hence, P \u2229 gPg \u22121 equals the centralizer (in G) of some maximal k-split torus of\nG. Then as the Tits system (B, N ) is saturated, H = P \u2229 sP s\u22121 \u2229 G = ZG (S)(k) \u2229 G for a suitable\nmaximal k-split torus S of G. From the fact that the identity component of the Zariski-closure of\nH = ZG (S)(k) \u2229 G in G equals ZG\u266e (S) (2.5), we see that the Zariski-closure of H in G contains S\nas the maximal k-split central torus, and hence the normalizer of H in G is contained in NG (S)(k).\nNow since N normalizes H and contains it as a subgroup of index 2, whereas N := NG (S)(k) \u2229 G\nis the unique such subgroup of G , we conclude that N = N . Thus the saturated Tits system (B, N )\nis a standard Tits system. This proves assertion (2) of 5.1.\n5.3. A Tits system of rank 1 in G := SLn+1 (k). Let B be the subgroup of matrices in G whose\nfirst column has all the entries zero except the top entry. Let B \u2032 be the subgroup of matrices in G\nwhose last column has all the entries zero except the bottom entry. Let H = B \u2229 B \u2032 , and choose\na g \u2208 G such that gBg\u22121 = B \u2032 , and let N = H \u222a gH. Then N is a subgroup and H is a normal\nsubgroup of N of index 2. It is easily checked that (B, N ) is a spherical Tits system in G of rank\n1. Note that B itself admits a Tits system of rank n \u2212 1 since it is isomorphic to GLn (k) \u22c9 kn .\nIt has been pointed out by Pierre-Emmanuel Caprace and Katrin Tent that giving a Tits system\n(B, N ) of rank 1 in G is equivalent to providing a 2-transitive action of G on a set X with at\nleast two elements: Given X with a 2-transitive action of G, and a pair x 6= x\u2032 in X, let B be the\nstabilizer of x and N be the stabilizer of the subset {x, x\u2032 }. Then (B, N ) is a Tits system of rank\n1 in G. Conversely, given a Tits system (B, N ) of rank 1 in G, the natural action of G on G/B is\n2-transitive. Now in the above example, the set X is the projective space Pn (k) with the natural\naction of SLn+1 (k).\n6. Proof of Theorem B for Tits systems of arbitrary rank\n6.1. We will continue to use the notation introduced in \u00a7\u00a71-2. Let (B, N ) be a weakly-split Tits\nsystem in G with Weyl group W T . We assume that W T is finite, i.e., the Tits system is spherical,\nand let S be the distinguished set of involutive generators of W T . Let B = HU , with H = B \u2229 N ,\nand U a nilpotent normal subgroup of B. Let U be the identity component of the Zariski-closure\nof U in G. For s \u2208 S, let Gs = B \u222a BsB. For a subset X of S, let WXT be the subgroup of W T\ngenerated by the elements in X, and GX = BWXT B. Then for each s \u2208 S, and X \u2286 S, Gs and GX\nare subgroups of G .\n\n\f16\n\n6.2. We will prove Theorem B by induction on the rank (= #S) of the Tits system (B, N ). If\nthe rank is zero, i.e., if S is empty, B = G . Then the first assertion of Theorem B holds if we\ntake P = G. The hypothesis \"B does not contain a non-central normal subgroup of the group\nof k-rational points of a k-isotropic minimal perfect smooth connected normal k-subgroup of G\"\nin the second assertion does not hold in this case if D(G) is k-isotropic. So to prove the second\nassertion when S is empty, we assume thatTD(G) is k-anisotropic. If the Tits system (B, N ), with\nB = G is saturated, then H := B \u2229 N = n\u2208N nG n\u22121 = G , and hence, N = G . The Tits system\n(B, N ) = (G , G ) is clearly the unique standard Tits system in G if D(G) is k-anisotropic.\nNow let us assume that #S > 0. For s \u2208 S, as the index of B in Gs (\u2286 G ) has been assumed\nto be infinite, the index of B in G is infinite. Then according to Proposition 5, Rus,k (B) is\nnontrivial, and by Proposition 6 there exists a proper pseudo-parabolic k-subgroup Q of G such\nthat Rus,k (B) \u2286 Rus,k (Q) and B \u2286 Q(k). If B = Q(k) \u2229 G , then the first assertion holds if we take\nP = Q, so let us assume that B 6= Q(k) \u2229 G . As Q(k) \u2229 G properly contains B, and is not equal\nto G (2.5), it equals GX for a nonempty subset X (6= S) of S. The quotient M := Q/Rus,k (Q)\nis a quasi-reductive k-group. Let M be the image of GX \u2286 Q(k) under the natural projection\nQ(k) \u2192 M(k) and let K = Rus,k (Q)(k). As Rus,k (Q) is a k-split smooth connected unipotent\nsubgroup, K \u2282 G+ \u2286 G . So K is a normal subgroup of GX = Q(k) \u2229 G , and the projection map\nGX \u2192 M induces an isomorphism of GX /K with M . We will use this isomorphism to identify\nGX /K with M . We see from Proposition 3 that K is contained in B.\n6.3. Let NX = N \u2229 GX , B = B/K and N X = NX K/K. Then (B, NX ) is a Tits system in GX\nand (B, N X ) is a Tits system in M = GX /K. Let H (resp., U ) be the image of H (resp., U ) in\nB. As B = HU , B = HU ; moreover, since B \u2229 NX K = (B \u2229 NX )K = HK, B \u2229 N X = H, so\nthe Tits system (B, N X ) in M is weakly-split. As H \u2286 NX \u2229 HK \u2286 NX \u2229 B \u2286 H, the natural\nhomomorphism WXT = NX /H \u2192 N X /H is an isomorphism, and hence the Weyl group of the Tits\nsystem (B, N X ) in M is WXT . For x \u2208 X, M x (= B \u222a BxB) is the image of Gx in M and the\ninduced map Gx /B \u2192 M x /B is bijective. Therefore, the index of B in M x is infinite for all x \u2208 X.\nNow since the rank of the Tits system (B, N X ) is #X < #S, we conclude by induction on the rank\nof Tits systems that there exists a proper pseudo-parabolic k-subgroup P of the quasi-reductive\nk-group M = Q/Rus,k (Q) such that B = P(k) \u2229 M . Let P be the inverse image of P in Q. Then\nP is a pseudo-parabolic k-subgroup of G (Lemma 3.5.5 of [6]), and B \u2286 P(k). Moreover, since B\ncontains the kernel K = Rus,k (Q)(k) of the natural map Q(k) \u2192 M(k), and its image B in M(k)\nequals P(k) \u2229 M , we conclude that B = P(k) \u2229 G =: P. This proves the first assertion of Theorem\nB.\n6.4. Now to prove the second assertion of Theorem B, we will assume that the Tits system (B, N )\nis saturated and B does not contain a non-central normal subgroup of the group of k-rational points\nof a k-isotropic minimal perfect smooth connected normal k-subgroup of G. We wish to first find\na maximal k-split torus S of G such that Z := ZG (S)(k) \u2229 G \u2286 H = B \u2229 N . For this purpose, and\nalso for use later, we introduce the following notation: for an element w \u2208 W T , l(w) will denote its\nlength with respect to the distinguished set of generators S of the Weyl group W T . The longest\nelement of W T will be denoted by w0 . We will now show that B\u2229w0 Bw0\u22121 = H. For this, we will use\nLemma 13.13 of [13]. This lemma says that B\u2229ww\u2032 B(ww\u2032 )\u22121 \u2286 B\u2229wBw\u22121 if l(ww\u2032 ) = l(w)+l(w\u2032 ).\nBut given T\nany w \u2208 W T , let w\u2032 = w\u22121 w0 . Then ww\u2032 = w0 , and l(w) + l(w\u2032 ) = l(w0 ), which implies\nthat H = w\u2208W T wBw\u22121 = B \u2229 w0 Bw0\u22121 . Therefore, H = B \u2229 w0 Bw0\u22121 = P \u2229 w0 Pw0\u22121 . Now we\n\n\f17\n\nnote that P \u2229 w0 Pw0\u22121 is a smooth connected subgroup which contains the centralizer ZG (S) of a\nmaximal k-split torus S of G (Propositions 3.5.12 and C.2.7 of [6]). Hence, Z \u2286 P \u2229w0 Pw0\u22121 = H.\n6.5. We will next prove that P is a minimal pseudo-parabolic k-subgroup of G. Let us fix a minimal\npseudo-parabolic k-subgroup P0 of G contained in P and containing ZG (S). Let P0 = P0 (k),\nP0 = P0 \u2229 G , Z = ZG (S)(k) and N = NG (S)(k) \u2229 G . Recall from 1.2 that N maps onto the\nk-Weyl group W = NG (S)(k)/ZG (S)(k). It was observed in the proof of Proposition 7 that for all\nn \u2208 N , P0 nP0 = P0 nP0 Z and G = G Z.\nLet \u03a6 be the set of k-roots of G with respect to S, \u03a6+ the positive system of roots and \u2206 (\u2286 \u03a6+ )\nthe set of simple roots given by P0 . For a nondivisible root b \u2208 \u03a6, let Ub be the root group\ncorresponding to it (see [6], C.2.20); Ub is the largest smooth connected unipotent k-subgroup of\nG normalized by S on whose Lie algebra the only weights of S under the adjoint action are positive\nintegral multiples of b. Then there is a subset \u2206\u2032 of \u2206 such that P is generated by P0 and the\nroot groups U\u2212a , a \u2208 \u2206\u2032 . We will now prove that P = P0 , or, equivalently, that \u2206\u2032 is empty.\nThe condition that B (= P = P(k) \u2229 G ) does not contain a non-central subgroup of the group\nof k-rational points of a k-isotropic minimal perfect smooth connected normal k-subgroup of G is\nequivalent to the condition that \u2206\u2032 does not contain any connected components of \u2206 (see Remark\n1 above and Proposition C.2.32 of [6]).\nLet R = {ra | a \u2208 \u2206}, where for a \u2208 \u2206, ra \u2208 W is the reflection in a. The reflections in R\ngenerate W ; for w \u2208 W , we will denote the length of w, with respect to this generating set, by\nl(w). The rank of W , i.e., the number of elements in \u2206, is equal to the k-rank of D(G) (1.2). For\na subset X of R, we will denote by WX the subgroup of W generated by the elements in X. For\nw \u2208 W , P0 wP0 and PwP will denote the double cosets P0 nP0 and PnP respectively, where\nn is any representative of w in N . For X \u2286 R, let G X = P0 WX P0 . Any subgroup of G that\ncontains P0 equals G X for a unique X \u2286 R. Now let Y \u2282 R be such that B = P = G Y . Then\nY = {ra | a \u2208 \u2206\u2032 }. For s \u2208 S, as Gs = B \u222a BsB is a subgroup containing B = P, there is a\nsubset Ys of R containing Y such that Gs = G Ys . Since there is no subgroup of G lying properly\nbetween B and Gs , Ys = Y \u222a {ras } for some as \u2208 \u2206 \u2212 \u2206\u2032 , and then BsB = Pras P. For distinct\nelements s, s\u2032 of S, since Gs \u2229 Gs\u2032 = B = P, and the collection of subgroups {Gs }s\u2208S generates G ,\nwe conclude that if s 6= s\u2032 then as 6= as\u2032 , and moreover, {as | s \u2208 S} = \u2206 \u2212 \u2206\u2032 .\nAssume, if possible, that \u2206\u2032 is nonempty. Then since \u2206\u2032 does not contain any connected components of \u2206, we can find a root a \u2208 \u2206\u2032 such that there is a root b \u2208 \u2206 \u2212 \u2206\u2032 connected to a.\nAs b \u2208\n/ \u2206\u2032 , \u2212b is not a weight of S on the Lie algebra of P. Let s \u2208 S be the element such\nthat b = as . Let P\u2032 be the pseudo-parabolic k-subgroup generated by P and the root group U\u2212b\n\u2032\nand let P \u2032 = P\u2032 (k). Let M = P\u2032 /Rus,k (P\u2032 ) be the maximal quasi-reductive quotient of P\u2032 and\n\u2032\n\u2032\nM := M (k). Then P \u2032 := P \u2032 \u2229 G = Gs = P \u222a Prb P. Since P\u2032 \u2283 P, Rus,k (P\u2032 ) \u2282 Rus,k (P)\n\u2032\n\u2032\n(Proposition 3.5.14 of [6]) and hence K \u2032 := Rus,k (P\u2032 )(k) \u2282 P = B. Let P, P and N denote\n\u2032\nthe respective images of P, P \u2032 and N \u2032 := N \u2229 P \u2032 in M = P \u2032 /K \u2032 . Since (B = P, N \u2032 ) is a Tits\n\u2032\n\u2032\nsystem of rank 1 in P \u2032 , (P, N ) is a Tits system of rank 1 in P . To see that this Tits system\nis weakly-split, let H and U be the images of H and U in P. Then P = HU ; moreover, as\n\u2032\nP \u2229 N \u2032 K \u2032 = (P \u2229 N \u2032 )K \u2032 \u2286 (P \u2229 N )K \u2032 = (B \u2229 N )K \u2032 = HK \u2032 , we find that P \u2229 N = H, which\n\u2032\nshows that the Tits system (P, N ) is weakly-split.\n\n\f18\n\nBy Proposition C.2.32 of [6], there is a k-isotropic minimal perfect smooth connected normal\n\u2032\n\u2032\nk-subgroup of M whose k-root system is the connected component of the root system (of M )\ncontaining a. As b is connected to a, this connected component contains b and so is of rank at\n\u2032\n\u2032\nleast 2. Proposition 7 applied to the quasi-reductive group M , the image of P in M (this image\n\u2032\nis a pseudo-parabolic k-subgroup of M ) in place of G and P, and the weakly-split Tits system\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n(P, N ) of rank 1 in P (\u2286 M = M (k)), implies that the image of P in M contains this k\u2032\nisotropic minimal perfect smooth connected normal k-subgroup of M . From this we infer that \u2212b\nis a weight of S on the Lie algebra of P. But this is not true. Thus we have proved that \u2206\u2032 is\nempty, and hence P = P0 is a minimal pseudo-parabolic k-subgroup of G. In particular, the map\ns 7\u2192 ras from S into R is bijective.\n6.6. Having proved that P is a minimal pseudo-parabolic k-subgroup of G and B = P = P(k)\u2229G ,\nwe will now prove that H = Z = Z \u2229 G and N = NG (S)(k) \u2229 G = NG (Z). We begin by recalling\nfrom [3], Ch. IV, \u00a72.4, Theorem 2, that\n(\u2217) for w \u2208 W T (resp., w \u2208 W ) and s \u2208 S (resp., r \u2208 R) l(sw) > l(w) (resp., l(rw) > l(w))\nif and only if BsB * BwB = BswB (resp., PrP * PwP = PrwP), and if l(sw) < l(w) then\nBsB * BwB is the union of two distinct {B, B}-double cosets BwB and BswB.\nFor s \u2208 S, let as be as in 6.5. We will first prove that the map S \u2192 W which maps s onto ras\nextends to an isomorphism of W T onto W . For this purpose, let s, s\u2032 \u2208 S and m be the common\norder of ss\u2032 and s\u2032 s in W T . Let w (resp., w)\ne be the product of the first m terms of the sequence\n\u2032\n\u2032\n{s , s, s , s, . . .} (resp., of the sequence {ras\u2032 , ras , ras\u2032 , ras , . . .}). Then l(w) = m, and l(sw) = m \u2212 1.\nSince B = P, BsB = Pras P, and Bs\u2032 B = Pras\u2032 P, by repeated application of (\u2217) we easily\nsee that l(w)\ne = m, and l(ras w)\ne = m \u2212 1. This observation implies that the order of the product\nras\u2032 ras (in the k-Weyl group W ) is also m. Now since (W T , S) and (W, R) are Coxeter groups, we\nconclude that the map s 7\u2192 ras of S into R extends uniquely to an isomorphism W T \u2192 W . In\nparticular, W T and W are of equal order, say n.\nWe have shown in 6.4 that H \u2287 Z . We will now prove that these two subgroups are equal.\nFor this, we note that since P is a minimal pseudo-parabolic k-subgroup of G, B = P has\nprecisely n distinct conjugates in G containing Z , these are wPw\u22121 , w \u2208 W . The intersection\nof these conjugates equals Z . On the other hand, since the Weyl group W T of the Tits system\n(B, N ) is of order n, at least n distinct conjugates, namely wBw\u22121 , w \u2208 W T , of B contain H,\nand hence also Z . Therefore, there are exactly n distinct conjugates of B = P which contain\nH, and these conjugates are wBw\u22121 , w \u2208 W T . Thus the collections {wPw\u22121 | w \u2208 W } and\n{wBw\u22121 | w \u2208 T\nW T } are the same.TThe hypothesis that the Tits system (B, N ) is saturated now\ngives that H = w\u2208W T wBw\u22121 = w\u2208W wPw\u22121 = Z .\nTo complete the proof of the second assertion of Theorem B it only remains to show that\nN = NG (S)(k) \u2229 G = N . For this, we recall from 2.5 that the identity component of the Zariskiclosure of H = Z = ZG (S)(k) \u2229 G equals ZG\u266e (S), and hence S is the maximal k-split central torus\nof the Zariski-closure of H in G. This implies that any element of G which normalizes H belongs\nto NG (S)(k). Therefore, N \u2286 NG (H) \u2286 NG (S)(k) \u2229 G = N . But [N : H] = n = [N : H] as\nboth the Weyl groups W and W T have order n. This implies that N = N , and we have proved\nTheorem B.\n\u0003\n\n\f19\n\nWe will end this paper with the following proposition and two remarks.\nProposition 8. Assume that G is a perfect pseudo-reductive k-group, G is a subgroup of G := G(k)\nthat is Zariski-dense in G and contains G+ . Let (B, N ) be a split spherical Tits system in G and\nU be a nilpotent normal subgroup of B such that B = H \u22c9 U , with H = B \u2229 N . Assume that B\ndoes not contain a non-central normal subgroup of the group of k-rational points of a k-isotropic\nminimal perfect smooth connected normal k-subgroup of G. Let P be the minimal pseudo-parabolic\nk-subgroup of G such that B = P(k) \u2229 G . Then U = Ru,k (P)(k).\nProof. Let H and U be respectively the identity components of the Zariski-closures of H and U in\nG. Then B normalizes U and the identity component of the Zariski-closure of B in G is HU. As\nG has been assumed to be perfect, G is Zariski-dense in G so G\u266e = G, P\u266e = P, and B = P(k) \u2229 G\nis Zariski-dense in P (2.3\u20132.5). Hence, HU = P. By Proposition 1(ii), U is unipotent. Since it is\nnormalized by B, it is a smooth connected unipotent normal k-subgroup of P. This implies that\nU \u2286 Ru,k (P). Note that Ru,k (P) = Rus,k (P) by Corollary 2.2.5 of [6] since G has been assumed\nto be pseudo-reductive. Let S be a maximal k-split torus of P such that H = ZG (S)(k) \u2229 G (6.6).\nThen H \u2286 M := ZG (S). Let M = M(k), P = P(k), and S = S(k). As P is a minimal pseudoparabolic k-subgroup of G, P = M \u22c9 Rus,k (P) (Proposition C.2.4 and Corollary 2.2.5 of [6]), hence\nP = M \u22c9 Rus,k (P)(k).\nNow P = HU \u2286 MU \u2286 M \u22c9 Rus,k (P) = P, which implies that H = M and U = Rus,k (P).\nSo U(k) \u2282 G+ \u2286 G . To prove that U = U(k), we consider the natural projection map \u03c0 : P =\nM \u22c9 U(k) \u2192 M . Its kernel is U(k) which contains a subgroup of finite index of U , so F := \u03c0(U )\nis a finite subgroup of M and U \u2286 F * U(k). On the other hand, since B = P(k) \u2229 G \u2283 U(k) and\nB = H \u22c9U , we see that U(k) \u2282 F *U . From this we easily deduce that the index of V := U \u2229U(k) in\nU(k) is #F , in particular this index is finite. The subgroup V is clearly normalized by S\u2229B = S\u2229G .\nWe assert that S \u2229 G+ , and hence also S \u2229 G , is Zariski-dense in S. To prove this, we may\nclearly replace G with a k-split semi-simple subgroup which contains S as a maximal k-torus and\nwhose root system is the set of non-multipliable roots in the root system of G with respect to S\n(for a proof of existence of such a k-split semi-simple subgroup, see Theorem C.2.30 of [6]), and\nassume that G is a k-split semi-simple group. But for a k-split semi-simple group our assertion is\nwell-known. (It can be proved by considering the simply connected central cover of G.)\nWe will show that U(k) does not contain a proper subgroup of finite index that is normalized\nby a subgroup S of S which is Zariski-dense in S. Assuming this for a moment, the subgroup\nV := U \u2229 U(k), which is a subgroup of U(k) of finite index (= #F ) normalized by the group\nS \u2229 G (which is Zariski-dense in S), equals U(k). Hence, #F = 1, which implies that U \u2286 U(k).\nThis in turn implies that U = U(k), which proves the proposition modulo the assertion that U(k)\ndoes not contain a proper subgroup of finite index which is normalized by a subgroup S of S\nwhich is Zariski-dense in S. To prove that U(k) does not contain a proper subgroup of finite index\nthat is normalized by such an S , we note that as S is Zariski-dense in S, for any root a, a(S )\nis Zariski-dense in GL1 . So the subfield ka of k generated by a(S ) is infinite. Now, if a is not\nmultipliable, then the root group Ua is a vector group admitting a k-linear structure such that any\nelement s of S acts by multiplication by a(s). Thus any subgroup of Ua (k) which is stable under\nthe conjugation action of S is a ka -vector subspace of Ua (k). Therefore, any S -stable subgroup\nof Ua (k) either equals Ua (k) or is of infinite index in it. On the other hand, if a is multipliable,\nthen both Ua /U2a and U2a are nonzero vector groups and a similar consideration implies that\n\n\f20\n\nany S -stable subgroup of Ua (k) either equals Ua (k) or is of infinite index in it. Since U(k) is\ngenerated by the Ua (k)'s, we are done.\n\u0003\nRemark 5. The above proposition does not hold in general if G is not perfect. To see an example,\nconsider the group G = GL2 (R) with its standard Tits system (B, N ) in which B is the subgroup\nof upper triangular matrices and N is the normalizer of the diagonal subgroup. The subgroup\nH := B \u2229 N is the subgroup \u0012\nof diagonal\n\u0013 matrices. Let U be the commutative normal subgroup of\net tet\n, t \u2208 R. Then B = H \u22c9 U is a nonstandard splitting of B.\nB consisting of the matrices\n0 et\nThe Zariski-closure of U in GL2 is a connected subgroup which is not unipotent (it contains the\ncentral GL1 ) which shows that Proposition 1(ii) does not hold in general if we drop the hypothesis\nthat U \u2282 D(G).\nRemark 6. Theorem B has the following simple consequences. Let k1 and k2 be infinite fields.\nFor i = 1, 2, let Gi be a perfect quasi-reductive ki -group. Assume that Gi does not contain a\nki -isotropic perfect smooth connected proper normal ki -subgroup. Let G+\ni be the normal subgroup\nof Gi (ki ) generated by the group of ki -rational points of the ki -split unipotent radicals of pseudoparabolic ki -subgroups of Gi and Gi be a subgroup of Gi (ki ) containing G+\ni that is Zariski-dense\nin Gi . If there exists an isomorphism f : G1 \u2192 G2 of abstract groups, then k1 -rank G1 = k2 -rank\nG2 , and given a maximal k1 -split torus S1 in G1 , there is a maximal k2 -split torus S2 of G2 such\nthat f carries the centralizer ZG1 (S1 ) of S1 in G1 isomorphically onto the centralizer ZG2 (S2 ) of S2\nin G2 . In fact, in Gi we have the standard split Tits system provided by the underlying algebraic\nki -group Gi (1.2). Theorem B implies that under the isomorphism f : G1 \u2192 G2 , these Tits systems\nare conjugate to each other. This at once implies both the assertions.\nNow for i = 1, 2, let Gi be a perfect pseudo-reductive ki -group, and assume that Gi does\nnot contain a ki -isotropic perfect smooth connected proper normal ki -subgroup. We will use the\nnotation introduced in the preceding paragraph. From Proposition 8 and Theorem B we see that the\nisomorphism f : G1 \u2192 G2 carries the group of k1 -rational points of the k1 -split unipotent radical of\na minimal pseudo-parabolic k1 -subgroup of G1 isomorphically onto the group of k2 -rational points\nof the k2 -split unipotent radical of a minimal pseudo-parabolic k2 -subgroup of G2 .\nWe note that Propositions 7.3.3(2) and 9.7.4(1) of [6] show that over any local or global function\nfield k of characteristic 2 or 3, there exists a non-reductive pseudo-split perfect pseudo-reductive\nk-group G1 and a split connected semi-simple k-group G2 such that G1 (k) \u2243 G2 (k).\nAcknowledgements.
