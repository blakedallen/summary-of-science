TOMS\nAbstract. Simple and nuclear C \u2217 -algebras which fail to absorb the Jiang-Su\nalgebra tensorially have settled many open questions in the theory of nuclear\nC \u2217 -algebras, but have been little studied in their own right. This is due partly\nto a dearth of invariants sensitive to differences between such algebras. We\npresent two new real-valued invariants to fill this void: the dimension-rank\nratio (for unital AH algebras), and the radius of comparison (for unital and\nstably finite algebras). We establish their basic properties, show that they\nhave natural connections to ordered K-theory, and prove that the range of the\ndimension-rank ratio is exhausted by simple algebras (this last result shows the\nclass of simple, nuclear and non-Z-stable C \u2217 -algebras to be uncountable). In\npassing, we establish a theory of moderate dimension growth for AH algebras,\nthe existence of which was first supposed by Blackadar. The minimal instances\nof both invariants are shown to coincide with the condition of being tracially\nAF among simple unital AH algebras of real rank zero and stable rank one,\nwhence they may be thought of as generalised measures of dimension growth.\nWe argue that the radius of comparison may be thought of as an abstract\nversion of the dimension-rank ratio.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe Jiang-Su algebra Z is by now well known in the study of nuclear C \u2217 -algebras.\nAll evidence indicates that the property of being Z-stable - a C \u2217 -algebra A is\nsaid to be Z-stable if A \u2297 Z \u223c\n= A - is connected naturally to Elliott's program\nto classify separable and nuclear C \u2217 -algebras ([8]); examples due to R\u00f8rdam and\nthe author show that the largest class of simple, separable, unital and nuclear\nC \u2217 -algebras which may be classified up to \u2217-isomorphism by the Elliott invariant\nconsists of those algebras which are, in addition, Z-stable ([27], [30], [31]). It has\nbeen surprising to find that almost all of our stock-in-trade simple, separable, and\nnuclear C \u2217 -algebras are Z-stable ([15], [35]).\nLittle is known about non-Z-stable C \u2217 -algebras in general, save that they seem\nable to exhibit arbitrarily strange behaviour. Specific examples of such algebras\nhave, over the past several years, been used to settle many open questions in the\ntheory of separable and nuclear C \u2217 -algebras - see [27], [29], [30], [31], [32], [36], and\n[37] - but no attempt has been made to study their structure systematically. In\nthis paper - a sequel to [33] in design, though technically independent of it - we\nstudy these algebras through the introduction of invariants which distill purely nonZ-stable information: they are insensitive to differences between Z-stable algebras,\nwhile detecting differences between non-Z-stable C \u2217 -algebras not readily manifest\nin known invariants.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification.

TOMS\n\nIn the early sections of the sequel we concentrate on approximately homogeneous\n(AH) C \u2217 -algebras, as these provide the most tractable examples of simple and nonZ-stable C \u2217 -algebras. Recall that a homogeneous C \u2217 -algebra has the form\np(C(X) \u2297 K)p,\nwhere X is a compact Hausdorff space, K is the algebra of compact operators\non a separable and infinite-dimensional Hilbert space H, and p \u2208 C(X) \u2297 K is a\nprojection of constant rank. A semi-homogeneous C \u2217 -algebra is a finite direct sum\nof homogeneous C \u2217 -algebras.\nDefinition 1.1 (Blackadar, [2]). An approximately homogeneous (AH) C \u2217 -algebra\nis an inductive limit\nA = lim (Ai , \u03c6i ),\ni\u2192\u221e\n\nwhere each Ai is semi-homogeneous.\nLet\nA\u223c\n= lim (Ai , \u03c6i )\n\n(1)\n\ni\u2192\u221e\n\nbe an unital (i.e., both Ai and \u03c6i : Ai \u2192 Ai+1 are unital for every i \u2208 N) AH\nalgebra, where\n(2)\n\nAi :=\n\nmi\nM\n\npi,l (C(Xi,l ) \u2297 K)pi,l\n\nl=1\n\nfor compact Hausdorff spaces Xi,l , projections pi,l \u2208 C(Xi,l ) \u2297 K, and natural\nnumbers mi . Put\n\u03c6ij = \u03c6j\u22121 \u25e6 \u03c6j\u22122 \u25e6 * * * \u25e6 \u03c6i ,\nand write \u03c6i\u221e : Ai \u2192 A for the canonical map. We refer to this collection of objects\nand maps as a decomposition for A. If the \u03c6i are injective, then we will refer to\nthis collection as an injective decomposition.\nDefinition 1.2. Let A be an unital AH algebra. Say that A has flat dimension\ngrowth if it admits a decomposition for which\n\u001b\n\u001a\ndim(Xi,l )\n< \u221e.\n(3)\nlim sup max1\u2264l\u2264mi\nrank(pi,l )\ni\u2192\u221e\nA simple unital AH algebra A admitting a decomposition for which (3) is zero is said\nto have slow dimension growth ([3]). (There are definitions of slow dimension growth\nfor non-simple algebras in [21] and [10], but we will not require them here. Suffice\nit to say that these definitions coincide with Definition 1.2 for simple algebras.) If\n(3) is finite for some decomposition of A, then we may, by passing to a subsequence,\nreplace the lim sup by a limit; proofs in the sequel with exploit this.\nThe beginnings of Definition 1.2 are contained in Blackadar's 1991 survey article\n\"Matricial and Ultramatricial Topology\" ([2]). At the time, all known simple unital\nAH algebras had slow dimension growth, but Blackadar mused nonetheless about\nthe possible existence of a theory of \"AH algebras with moderate dimension growth\"\n(synonymous with our flat dimension growth). His hoped-for theory was made\nplausible when Villadsen provided the first examples of simple unital AH algebras\nwithout slow dimension growth in 1996 ([36]). In the sequel we prove that there\ndoes indeed exist a theory of flat dimension growth for AH algebras, and that the\n\n\fFLAT DIMENSION GROWTH FOR C \u2217 -ALGEBRAS\n\n3\n\nnatural way to study this theory is through an invariant we call the dimensionrank ratio. This invariant for unital AH algebras takes values in the nonnegative\nreals and recovers, roughly, the minimum possible value of the limit in (3). It\nturns out to be of the variety we seek: it is insensitive to differences between Zstable algebras (provided that they are simple and of real rank zero); it detects\nsubtle differences between non-Z-stable algebras. It is also naturally connected to\nordered K-theory. These connections lead us to define an invariant for general unital\nand stably finite C \u2217 -algebras - the radius of comparison - which measures of the\nfailure of comparison in the Cuntz semigroup. This, we argue, is the appropriate\nabstraction of the dimension-rank ratio. Both invariants can be viewed as measuring\nthe ratio of the matricial size of a C \u2217 -algebra to its topological dimension (as\nconstituted by Kirchberg and Winter's decomposition rank - see [17]), despite the\nfact that both quantities are frequently infinite for non-Z-stable algebras.\nOur paper is organised as follows: in section 2 we give the precise definition of\nthe dimension-rank ratio, give a formula for it in the case of semi-homogeneous\nC \u2217 -algebras, and examine its behaviour with respect to common constructions; in\nsection 3 we draw connections between the dimension-rank ratio and ordered Ktheory; section 4 shows that, among simple algebras of real rank zero, the minimal\ninstance of the dimension-rank ratio coincides with the condition of being tracially\nAF; the range of the dimension-rank ratio is shown to be exhausted by simple\nalgebras in section 5; section 6 introduces the radius of comparison, defined for any\nunital and stably finite C \u2217 -algebra, and establishes analogues of some of our earlier\nresults on the dimension-rank ratio.\nAcknowledgements.

The dimension-rank ratio of an AH algebra\nDefinition 2.1. Let A be an unital AH algebra. Define the dimension-rank ratio\nof A (write drr(A)) to be the infimum of the set of strictly positive reals c such that\nA has a decomposition satisfying\n\u001b\n\u001a\ndim(Xi,l )\n= c,\nlim sup max1\u2264l\u2264mi\nrank(pi,l )\ni\u2192\u221e\nwhenever this set is not empty, and \u221e otherwise.\n\nBy compressing the inductive sequence decomposition for A if necessary, one can\nreplace the lim sup of Definition 2.1 with a limit. It is sketched in [2] and proved\nin [10] that the spaces Xi,l in an injective decomposition for an unital AH algebra\nA can always be replaced by CW-complexes X\u0303i,l of the same dimension. From\nhere on we will assume, unless otherwise noted, that the Xi,l s are CW-complexes.\nIt is also true that if one has a decomposition for A as in Definition 2.1 which is\nnot injective, then it can be replaced with an injective decomposition for which\nthe limit in Definition 2.1 is no larger (cf. [9]). Thus, we may assume that the\ndecomposition of the definition is injective whenever this is convenient.\n\n\f4\n\nANDREW S. TOMS\n\nOur first proposition collects some basic properties of the dimension-rank ratio.\nProposition 2.2. Let A, B be unital AH algebras, and I an ideal of A. Then:\n(i)\n(ii)\n(iii)\n(iv)\n\ndrr(A/I) \u2264 drr(A);\ndrr(A \u2295 B) = max{drr(A), drr(B)};\ndrr(A \u2297 Mk ) \u2264 (1/k)drr(A);\nif A and B are simple and of finite dimension-rank ratio, then A \u2297 B has\nslow dimension growth and drr(A \u2297 B) = 0.\n\nProof. For (i), let \u01eb > 0 be given, and fix an injective decomposition for A such\nthat for every i \u2208 N one has\n\u001b\n\u001a\ndim(Xi,l )\n= drr(A) + \u01eb.\nmax1\u2264l\u2264mi\nrank(pi,l )\nLet I be an ieal of A, and let \u03c6i\u221e : Ai \u2192 A be the canonical map. Then, Ii :=\n\u03c6\u22121\ni\u221e (I) is an ideal of Ai for every i \u2208 N. Define \u03c8i : Ai /Ii \u2192 Ai+1 /Ii+1 by\n\u03c8i (a + Ii ) = \u03c6i (a) + Ii+1 .\nOne can then check that A/I = limi\u2192\u221e (Ai /Ii , \u03c8i ). It is well known that\nAi /Ii =\n\nmi\nM\n\npi,l (C(Yi,l ) \u2297 K)pi,l\n\nl=1\n\nfor closed subspaces Yi,l \u2286 Xi,l , i \u2208 N, 1 \u2264 l \u2264 mi .

An inductive limit of\nAH algebras is only approximated locally by semi-homogeneous algebras, and the\nlatter condition is strictly weaker than approximate homogeneity ([7]). Thus, it\ndoes not make sense to investigate the behaviour of the dimension-rank ratio for\ninductive limits of AH algebras.\nOur first theorem shows that the dimension-rank ratio behaves as one would like\nfor semi-homogeneous C \u2217 -algebras. Note that the spectrum of B in the proposition\nbelow need not be a CW-complex, and need not be of finite covering dimension.\nTheorem 2.3.

By part (i) of Proposition 2.2, it will be enough to establish the theorem for\nn = 1 and X1 connected.\nSuppose first that B = p(C(X) \u2297 K)p for some connected compact Hausdorff\nspace X of finite covering dimension.

Let dr(\u2022) denote\nthe decomposition rank of a nuclear C \u2217 -algebra. In [39] it is proved that\ndr (p(C(X) \u2297 K)p) = dim(X)\nwhenever X is a compact. Section 3 of [17] shows that\ndr(C \u2295 D) = max{dr(C), dr(D)}\nfor any nuclear C and D. It follows that dr(B) = dim(X), and that\ndr(Ai ) = max1\u2264l\u2264mi {dim(Xi,l )} .\n\n\f6\n\nANDREW S.

By\ndropping terms from the inductive sequence for B, we may assume that dr(Ai ) =\ndr(B) for every i \u2208 N. In other words there exists, for each i \u2208 N, an 1 \u2264 li \u2264 mi\nsuch that\ndim(Xi,li ) = dim(X).\nIf\nrank(pi,l ) > max1\u2264j\u2264n {rank(pj )},\nthen the canonical map from pi,l (C(Xi,l ) \u2297 K)pi,l to B must be zero, contradicting\nthe injectivity of the decomposition.

It follows that\ndrr(p(C(X) \u2297 K)p) =\n\ndim(X)\n.\nrank(p)\n\nIf X is infinite-dimensional, then the decomposition rank argument from the\nsecond paragraph of the proof allows us to assume that for each i \u2208 N, there is\n1 \u2264 li \u2264 mi such that\ndim(Xi,li ) \u2265 i,\nand that the partial map from pi,li (C(Xi,li )\u2297K)pi,li is not zero. On the other hand,\nrank considerations show that there is M > 0 such that rank(pi,j ) < M whenever\nthe partial map from pi,j (C(Xi,j ) \u2297 K)pi,j is not zero.

Let sr(A) denote the stable\nrank of a C \u2217 -algebra A, and let \u2308x\u2309 (resp. \u230ax\u230b) denote the least (resp. greatest)\ninteger greater (resp. less) than x \u2208 R. Consider the following formula, established\nby Nistor in [22]:\n\u0019\n\u0018\n\u230adim(X)/2\u230b\n+1\n(7)\nsr(p(C(X) \u2297 K)p) =\nrank(p)\nwhenever X is a compact Hausdorff space and p \u2208 C(X) \u2297 K is a projection of\nconstant rank. Clearly, the right hand side is all but equal to 2drr(p(C(X) \u2297 K)p),\nwith any difference owing to the fact that the dimension-rank ratio need not be an\ninteger. This observation leads to:\n\nProposition 2.5. Let A be an unital AH algebra. Then,\nsr(A)\ndrr(A) \u2265\n\u2212 1.\n2\nProof. The proposition is trivial if sr(A) = 1, 2.\nSuppose that sr(A) < \u221e. Theorem 5.1 of [22] states that if A = limi (Ai , \u03c6i )\nis an inductive limit algebra where sr(Ai ) \u2264 n, \u2200i \u2208 N, then sr(A) \u2264 n. Thus,\nwe may assume that regardless of the decomposition A = limi\u2192\u221e (Ai , \u03c6i ), one has\nsr(Ai ) \u2265 sr(A). If the Ai are direct sums of homogeneous building blocks as in\nequation (2), then by (7) above we have\n\u0019\n\u0018\n\u230adim(Xi,l )/2\u230b\n+ 1 \u2265 sr(A)\nrank(pi,l )\n\nfor some 1 \u2264 l \u2264 mi . Straightforward calculation yields drr(Ai ) \u2265 (sr(A) \u2212 2)/2,\nso that lim supi\u2192\u221e drr(Ai ) \u2265 (sr(A) \u2212 2)/2. Since the decompostion of A was\narbitrary, we conclude that drr(A) \u2265 (sr(A) \u2212 2)/2.\nThe case of sr(A) = \u221e is similar.\n\u0003\n3. Ordered K-theory\nIn this section we establish connections between the dimension-rank ratio and\nthe ordered K-theory of AH algebras. We examine first the case of a homogeneous\nC \u2217 -algebra with spectrum a CW-complex of finite dimension.\nTheorem 3.1 (Husemoller, Theorems 1.2 and 1.5, Chapter 8, [14]). Let X be an\nn-dimensional CW-complex, and let \u03b3, \u03c9 be complex vector bundles over X.\n(i) If \u03b3 and \u03c9 are stably isomorphic and the fibre dimension of \u03b3 is greater\nthan or equal to \u2308n/2\u2309, then \u03b3 and \u03c9 are isomorphic.\n(ii) If the fibre dimension of \u03b3 exceeds that of \u03c9 by an amount greater than or\nequal to \u2308n/2\u2309, then \u03c9 is isomorphic to a sub-bundle of \u03b3.\n\nMaking the identifications\nK0 (p(C(X) \u2297 K)p) \u2261 K0 (C(X)) \u2261 K0 (X),\nwe recast Theorem 3.1 in terms of K-theory (this is standard fare). Let p, r \u2208\nM\u221e (C(X)) be projections, and let [p], [r] denote their K0 -classes. Then parts (i)\nand (ii) of Theorem 3.1 are equivalent to the following two statements, respectively:\n(i) if [p] = [r] and rank(p) \u2265 \u2308dim(X)/2\u2309, then p and r are Murray-von Neumann equivalent;\n\n\f8\n\nANDREW S. TOMS\n\n(ii) if rank(p) \u2212 rank(r) \u2265 \u2308dim(X)/2\u2309, then r is Murray-von Neumann equivalent to a subprojection of p (r \u227a p). In particular [p] \u2212 [r] \u2208 K0 (C(X))+ .\nLet A be an unital stably finite C \u2217 -algebra, and let QT(A) denote the compact\nconvex set of normalised quasi-traces on A. (A deep theorem of Haagerup ([13])\nasserts that every quasi-trace on an unital and exact C \u2217 -algebra A is a trace. Thus,\nwhen A is exact, unital, and stably finite, we identify QT(A) with the space T(A)\nof normalised traces on A.) We recall three familiar concepts in the K-theory of\nC \u2217 -algebras:\n(i) If projections p, q \u2208 M\u221e (A) are Murray-von Neumann equivalent whenever\n[p] = [q] \u2208 K0 A, then A is said to have cancellation of projections (or simply\ncancellation).\n(ii) If the condition that \u03c4 (p) < \u03c4 (q) for every \u03c4 \u2208 QT(A) implies that p is\nMurray-von Neumann equivalent to a subprojection of q, then we say that\nA has (FCQ) - A satisfies Blackadar's Second Fundamental Comparability\nQuestion.\n(iii) If, given elements x1 , x2 , y1 , y2 in a partially ordered Abelian group (G, G+ )\nsuch that xi \u2264 yj , i, j \u2208 {1, 2}, there exists z \u2208 G such that xi \u2264 z \u2264 yj ,\ni, j \u2208 {1, 2}, then we say that G has the Riesz interpolation property (or\nsimply interpolation).\nOur next definition generalises these notions and another besides.\nDefinition 3.2. Let A be an unital and stably finite C \u2217 -algebra, p, q \u2208 M\u221e (A)\nprojections, and r \u2265 0.\n(i) Say that A has r-cancellation if p and q are Murray-von Neumann equivalent whenever [p] = [q] and\n\u03c4 (p) = \u03c4 (q) > r, \u2200\u03c4 \u2208 QT(A).\n(ii) Say that A has r-(FCQ) if p is Murray-von Neumann equivalent to a subprojection of q whenever\n\u03c4 (p) + r < \u03c4 (q), \u2200\u03c4 \u2208 QT(A).\n+\n\n(iii) Let (G, G , u) be a partially ordered Abelian group with distinguished order\nunit u and state space S(G). Let r > 0. Say that G has r-interpolation if\nwhenever one has elements x1 , x2 , y1 , y2 \u2208 G such that xi \u2264 yj , i, j \u2208 {1, 2},\nand\ns(xi ) + r < s(yj ), i, j \u2208 {1, 2}, \u2200s \u2208 S(G),\nthen there exists z \u2208 G such that xi \u2264 z \u2264 yj , i, j \u2208 {1, 2}.\n(iv) Let (M, u) be a positive ordered semigroup with distinguished strong order\nunit u and state space S(M ). Let r > 0 and x, y \u2208 M . Say that M has\nr-strict comparison if\ns(x) + r < s(y), \u2200s \u2208 S(M ),\nimplies that x \u2264 y in M .\nWe will prove that the elements of Definition 3.2 are connected naturally to the\ndimension-rank ratio.\nTo prepare the next proposition, recall that a positive ordered semigroup (M, \u2264)\nis said to have an algebraic order if whenever one has x, y \u2208 M such that x \u2264 y,\nthen there is z \u2208 M such that x + z = y. M is said to be cancellative if whenever\none has elements x, y, z \u2208 M such that x + z = y + z, then x = y (cf. [11]).\n\n\fFLAT DIMENSION GROWTH FOR C \u2217 -ALGEBRAS\n\n9\n\nProposition 3.3. Let (M, v) be a positive ordered semigroup with distinguished\nstrong order unit v. Suppose that the order on M is algebraic, and that M is\ncancellative. Let G be the Grothendieck enveloping group of M . Let \u03b9 : M \u2192 G\ndenote the Grothendieck map, and put G+ = \u03b9(M ), u = \u03b9(v). Let S(G) denote the\nstate space of G.\nLet r > 0 and x, y \u2208 G. Then,\ns(x) + r < s(y), \u2200s \u2208 S(G),\nimplies that x \u2264 y in G if and only if (M, v) has r-strict comparison.\nProof. Our hypotheses on M imply that (M, v) \u223c\n= (\u03b9(M ), \u03b9(v)) = (G+ , u), whence\n+\n(G , u) has r-strict comparison if and only if (M, v) does.\nWe may identify S(G) and S(G+ ), whence the forward implication follows from\nrestricting to G+ . (There is a subtle point here: states on partially ordered Abelian\ngroups are merely positive homomorphisms into the reals which take the order unit\nto 1 \u2208 R, whereas states on ordered Abelian semigroups are, in addition, order\npreserving. We are using the fact that \u03b9(M ) \u223c\n= M whenever M is algebraically\nordered and cancellative to make our identification of state spaces ([11]). We are\ngrateful to Francesc Perera for pointing this out to us.)\nNow suppose that (G+ , u) has r-strict comparison. Let x, y \u2208 G and write\nx = x+ \u2212 x\u2212 , y = y+ \u2212 y\u2212 ,\n+\n\nwhere x+ , x\u2212 , y+ , y\u2212 \u2208 G . If\ns(x) + r < s(y), \u2200s \u2208 S(G),\nthen\ns(x+ + y\u2212 ) + r < s(y+ + x\u2212 ), \u2200s \u2208 S(G) \u2261 S(G+ ),\nwhence x+ + y\u2212 \u2264 y+ + x\u2212 in G+ . It follows that x \u2264 y, as desired.\n\n\u0003\n\nIn light of the proposition above, we will say that a partially ordered Abelian\ngroup (G, G+ , u) such that G+ \u223c\n= \u03b9(G+ ) has r-strict comparison whenever (G+ , u)\ndoes; this definition makes sense for the ordered K0 -group of an unital and stably\nfinite C \u2217 -algebra.\nProposition 3.4. Let A be an unital and stably finite C \u2217 -algebra, and (G, G+ , u) a\npartially ordered Abelian group with distinguished order unit u. Then, the following\nsets are closed:\n(i) A1 := {r \u2208 R| A has r \u2212 cancellation };\n(ii) A2 := {r \u2208 R| A has r \u2212 (FCQ) };\n(iii) A3 := {r \u2208 R| G has r \u2212 strict comparison };\n(iv) A4 := {r \u2208 R| G has r \u2212 interpolation }.\nProof. For each i \u2208 {1, 2, 3, 4} one has that s \u2208 Ai whenever s > r and r \u2208 Ai , so\nit will suffice to prove that \u03b1i := inf(Ai ) \u2208 Ai . The proof of each case follows a\ncommon thread.\nFor (i), let there be given projections p, q \u2208 M\u221e (A) such that\n[p] = [q], \u03c4 (p) = \u03c4 (q) > \u03b11 , \u2200\u03c4 \u2208 QT(A).\nThe map \u03c4 7\u2192 \u03c4 (p) on QT(A) is continuous and QT(A) is compact, so this map\nachieves a minimum value \u03b4 > \u03b11 .

Thus,\n\u03c4 (p) + \u03b4 < \u03c4 (q), \u2200\u03c4 \u2208 QT(A).\nSince \u03b4 \u2208 A2 , the desired conclusion follows.\nFor (iii), let x, y \u2208 G+ be such that\ns(x) + \u03b13 < s(y), \u2200s \u2208 S(G).\nThe map\ns 7\u2192 s(y) \u2212 s(x)\nis strictly positive and continuous, and the space S(G) is compact (cf. Proposition\n6.2, [11]). Thus, this map achieves a minimum value \u03b4 > \u03b13 . We now have\ns(x) + \u03b4 < s(y), \u2200s \u2208 S(G).\nSince \u03b4 \u2208 A3 , the desired conclusion follows.\nFor (iv), let there be given elements x1 , x2 , y1 , y2 \u2208 G satisfying\ns(xi ) + \u03b14 < s(yj ), i, j \u2208 {1, 2}, \u2200s \u2208 S(G).\nFor each pair (i, j), i, j \u2208 {1, 2}, there exists ri,j > 0 such that\ns(xi ) + \u03b14 + ri,j < s(yj ), \u2200s \u2208 S(G).\nPut \u03b4 = \u03b14 + min{r1,1 , r1,2 , r2,1 , r2,2 }.

The difference rank(q) \u2212 rank(r) is commonly referred to as the\nvirtual dimension of x. We will let rank(x) denote this virtual dimension, thus\nextending the notion of rank to all of K0 A. With this notation we have\ns(x) =\n\nrank(x)\n, \u2200x \u2208 K0 A.\nrank(p)\n\nWe may now rewrite (8) above as\nrank(xi ) dim(X)\n1\nrank(yj )\n+\n+\n<\n,\nrank(p)\nrank(p)\nrank(p)\nrank(p)\nwhich yields\nrank(yj ) \u2212 rank(xi ) > dim(X) + 1, i, j \u2208 {1, 2}.\nLet z be any element of K0 A such that\nrank(z) = max{rank(x1 ), rank(x2 )} + \u2308dim(X)/2\u2309.\nThen\nrank(z \u2212 xi ), rank(yj \u2212 z) \u2265 \u2308dim(X)/2\u2309, i, j \u2208 {1, 2},\nand z is the desired interpolating element by Theorem 3.1, (ii).\n\u0003\nWe shall see below that Proposition 3.5 can be generalised to the setting of general\nunital AH algebras, provided that the algebras have ordered K0 -groups which admit\na unique state.\nExample 3.6. While part (iii) of Proposition 3.5 gives a positive real r such that\nthe algebra A as in the hypotheses has r-interpolation, it is not immediately clear\nthat there may be a nonzero lower bound on the set of all such reals. But be\none there may. Consider, for any natural number n > 1, the C \u2217 -algebra A =\nMn (C(S 2n )). Clearly, drr(A) = 2. The ordered K0 -group of A is well known: it is\nisomorphic as a group to Z\u2295Z; the first co-ordinate is generated by the K0 -class [\u03b81 ]\nof the trivial line bundle \u03b81 ; the second co-ordinate is generated by the difference\n[\u03be] \u2212 [\u03b8n ], where \u03be is the bundle corresponding to the n-dimensional Bott projection\nand \u03b8n is the trivial bundle of fibre dimension n; the positive cone K0 A+ is\n{(x, y)|y = 0 and x \u2265 0} \u222a {(x, y)|x \u2265 n}.\nPut\nx1 = 0 \u2295 0, x2 = 0 \u2295 1, y1 = n \u2295 0, y2 = n \u2295 1.\nWith the description of K0 A+ in hand, one checks easily that\nxi \u2264 yj , i, j \u2208 {1, 2}.\nin K0 A, yet there is no z \u2208 K0 A which interpolates these four elements. The unique\ngeometric state s on K0 A returns the rank of a K0 element divided by n, whence\ns(xi ) + r < s(yj ), \u2200r < 1, i, j \u2208 {1, 2}.\nThus, K0 A does not have r-interpolation for any r < drr(A)/2.\nLemma 3.7. Let A \u223c\n= limi\u2192\u221e (Ai , \u03c6i ) be an unital AH algebra, where each Ai is\nhomogeneous with connected spectrum. Then, (K0 (A), K0 (A)+ , [1A ]) is a simple\npartially ordered Abelian group admitting a unique state.\n\n\f12\n\nANDREW S. TOMS\n\nProof. For each i \u2208 N write\nAi = pi (C(Xi ) \u2297 K)pi ,\nwhere Xi is a compact connected Hausdorff space, and pi \u2208 C(Xi ) \u2297 K is a projection. As noted following Definition 2.1, the Xi may be assumed to have finite\ncovering dimension (cf. [2], [10]). (K0 (A), K0 (A)+ ) is a partially ordered Abelian\ngroup for every stably finite A (cf. [1, Chapter 6, Section 3]).\nThere is a unique (geometric) state on K0 Ai which returns the normalised rank of\na projection corresponding to a positive K0 -class, and is extended to all of K0 Ai by\nlinearity. By Proposition 6.14 of [11], S(K0 A) is the inverse limit of the S(K0 Ai )s,\nwhence K0 A admits a unique state.\nIt remains to prove that (K0 (A), K0 (A)+ ) is a simple ordered group, i.e., that\nevery non-zero positive element is an order unit. It will suffice to prove that each\n(K0 (Ai ), K0 (Ai )+ ) is a simple ordered group. Each element of K0 (Ai ) = K0 (Xi )\ncorresponds to a difference x = [q] \u2212 [p], where q, p \u2208 M\u221e (Ai ) are projections. Let\ny = [e] \u2212 [f ] \u2208 K0 Ai , where e, f \u2208 M\u221e (Ai ) are projections. If x is positive, then\nrank(q) > rank(p). In particular, there exists n \u2208 N such that\nrank(nx) \u2212 (rank([e]) \u2212 rank([f ])) \u2265 \u2308dim(Xi )/2\u2309,\nso ny \u2265 y by Theorem 3.1, (ii), and x is an order unit.\n\n\u0003\n\nWe will need the following result to prove our next lemma:\nTheorem 3.8 (Goodearl, Proposition 4.16, [11]). Let (G, G+ , u) be a non-zero\npartially ordered Abelian group with distinguished order unit. If G admits a unique\nstate s, then for any x \u2208 G+ one has\ns(x)\n\n= inf{l/n|l, n \u2208 N and nx \u2264 lu}\n= sup{k/m|k \u2208 Z+ , m \u2208 N, and ku \u2264 mx}\n\nLemma 3.9. Let A be an unital AH algebra, and suppose that K0 (A) admits a\nunique state. Let there be given a decomposition of A as in equations (1) and (2)\nand a tolerance \u01eb > 0. Then, for any x \u2208 K0 (A)+ there exists j \u2208 N such that\n(i) x has a pre-image xj \u2208 K0 (Aj );\n(ii) if\nmj\nM\npj,l (C(Xj,l ) \u2297 K)pj,l ,\nAj =\nl=1\n\nand sl denotes the state on K0 (Aj ) which is equal to the (unique) geometric\nstate gl on K0 (pj,l (C(Xj,l ) \u2297 K)pj,l ) and zero on the other direct summands\nof Aj , then\n|sl (x) \u2212 s(x)| < \u01eb, 1 \u2264 l \u2264 mj .\n\nProof. By truncating the given inductive sequence for A, we may assume that x\nhas a pre-image in every Ai , i \u2208 N.\nUsing Theorem 3.8, find non-negative integers r, n, k, m such that\nr/n \u2212 s(x) < \u01eb/2, s(x) \u2212 k/m < \u01eb/2,\nnx \u2264 r[1A ], and k[1A ] \u2264 mx inside K0 (A). The last two inequalities must hold\nalready in some Aj , and, since K0 (Aj ) has the direct sum order coming from the\n\n\fFLAT DIMENSION GROWTH FOR C \u2217 -ALGEBRAS\n\n13\n\nsummands K0 (pj,l (C(Xj,l )\u2297K)pj,l ), they will still hold upon restricting to any such\nsummand. Let xl denote the restriction of x to K0 (pj,l (C(Xj,l ) \u2297 K)pj,l ). We have\nnxl \u2264 r[pj,l ], k[pj,l ] \u2264 mxl , 1 \u2264 l \u2264 mj .\nSince the geometric state gl on K0 (pj,l Mkj,l (C(Xj,l ))pj,l ) preserves order, we conclude that\nk/m \u2264 gl (xl ) \u2264 r/n.\nSince gl (xl ) = sl (x), the lemma follows.\n\n\u0003\n\nTheorem 3.10. Let A be an unital AH algebra with drr(A) < \u221e, and suppose that\nK0 (A) admits a unique state s. Then:\n(i) A has (drr(A)/2)-cancellation;\n(ii) A has (drr(A)/2)-(FCQ);\n(iii) K0 A has (drr(A)/2)-strict comparison.\nIf, in addition, A is simple, then\n(iv) K0 (A) has (drr(A))-interpolation.\nProof. We prove that A has (drr(A)/2 + \u01eb)-cancellation, (drr(A)/2 + \u01eb)-(FCQ),\n(drr(A)/2 + \u01eb)-strict comparison, and (drr(A) + \u01eb)-interpolation for every \u01eb > 0; the\ntheorem then follows from Proposition 3.4. Let \u01eb > 0 be given.\nFor (i), let there be given projections p, q \u2208 M\u221e (A) such that [p] = [q] and\n\u03c4 (p) = \u03c4 (q) = s([p]) = s([q]) > drr(A)/2 + \u01eb, \u2200\u03c4 \u2208 T(A).\nFix a decomposition A = limi\u2192\u221e (Ai , \u03c6i ) where\nAi =\n\nmi\nM\n\npi,l (C(Xi,l ) \u2297 K)pi,l\n\nl=1\n\nand\n\n\u001b\ndim(Xj,l )\n\u2264 drr + \u01eb/2, \u2200i \u2208 N.\nrank(pj,l )\nUse Lemma 3.9 to find j \u2208 N such that p and q have pre-images at the level of K0\n(which are projections) p\u0303 and q\u0303, respectively, in M\u221e (Aj ) with the properties that\n[p\u0303] = [q\u0303], s([p\u0303]) = s([p]), and\nmax1\u2264l\u2264mi\n\n\u001a\n\ns(p) \u2212 drr(A)\n, 1 \u2264 l \u2264 mj .\n4\nSince sl ([p\u0303]) represents the normalised rank of p\u0303 restricted to the direct summand\npj,l (C(Xj,l ) \u2297 K)pj,l of Aj , we conclude that this restriction is in the stable range\nof K0 (pj,l (C(Xj,l ) \u2297 K)pj,l ) (and similarly for the restriction of q\u0303). Thus, the said\nrestrictions, having the same class in K0 , are Murray-von Neumann equivalent by\nTheorem 3.1. It follows that p\u0303 and q\u0303 are Murray-von Neumann equivalent, whence\nso are p and q. This shows that A has (drr(A)/2 + \u01eb)-cancellation. Since \u01eb was\narbitrary, this proves (i).\nFor (ii), (iii), and (iv) we will retain the decomposition of A from the proof of\n(i); for (ii) and (iii) we will retain as the pre-images p\u0303 and q\u0303 of p and q above, with\nthe property that\n|sl ([p\u0303]) \u2212 s([p\u0303])| = |sl ([q\u0303]) \u2212 s([q\u0303])| <\n\n|sl ([p\u0303]) \u2212 s([p\u0303])|, |sl ([q\u0303]) \u2212 s([q\u0303])| <\n\ns(p) \u2212 drr(A)\n, 1 \u2264 l \u2264 mj .\n4\n\n\f14\n\nANDREW S. TOMS\n\nFor (ii), let there be given projections p, q \u2208 M\u221e (A) such that\n\u03c4 (p) + drr(A)/2 + \u01eb < \u03c4 (q), \u2200\u03c4 \u2208 T(A).\nSince K0 A has a unique state s, the statement above is equivalent to\ns([p]) + drr(A)/2 + \u01eb < s([q]).\nFind pre-images p\u0303 and q\u0303 as before. Then, the virtual dimension of the restriction\nof [q\u0303] \u2212 [p\u0303] to a direct summand pj,l (C(Xj,l ) \u2297 K)pj,l of Aj is in the stable range of\nK0 (pj,l (C(Xj,l ) \u2297 K)pj,l ), whence the said restriction is positive. The direct sum of\nthese restrictions, namely, [q\u0303] \u2212 [p\u0303] itself, is then positive. Write [q\u0303] = [p\u0303] + [r] for\nsome projection r \u2208 M\u221e (Aj ). Since\ns([p\u0303]) + s([r]) = s([q\u0303]) = s([q]) > drr(A)/2 + \u01eb,\nwe conclude by (i) that p\u0303 \u2295 r and q\u0303 are Murray-von Neumann equivalent. It follows\nthat p\u0303 is equivalent to a subprojection of q\u0303, and similarly for p and q. This proves\nthat A has (drr(A)/2 + \u01eb)-(FCQ), and so proves (ii).\nK0 A has (drr(A)/2 + \u01eb)-strict comparison if and only if the same is true of the\nsemigroup (K0 A+ , [1A ]). The latter condition is equivalent to the statement that\nfor [p], [q] \u2208 K0 A+ such that\ns([p]) + drr(A)/2 + \u01eb < s([q]),\none has [p] \u2264 [q]. This, in turn, follows from (i), proving (iii).\nFor (iv), we must prove that for any x1 , x2 , y1 , y2 \u2208 K0 A such that\nxi \u2264 yj , s(xi ) + drr(A) + \u01eb < s(yj ), i, j \u2208 {1, 2},\nthere exists z \u2208 K0 A such that xi \u2264 z \u2264 yj , i, j \u2208 {1, 2}.

A classification result\n\nClearly, slow dimension growth implies drr = 0. This begs the obvious question:\nQuestion 4.1. Does drr(A) = 0 imply that A has slow dimension growth for every\nsimple unital AH algebra A?\nThe next theorem and corollary provide a positive answer to Question 4.1 in the\ncase of simple algebras with real rank zero. It is plausible that this positive answer\nwill extend to simple algebras of real rank one, too. Recall that a simple partially\nordered Abelian group (G, G+ ) is said to be weakly unperforated if mx > 0 for some\nm \u2208 N and x \u2208 G implies that x > 0 (Chapter 6, [1]).\nTheorem 4.2. Let A be an unital AH algebra such that drr(A) = 0, and suppose\nthat K0 A is a simple ordered group. Then, K0 A is weakly unperforated, and A has\ncancellation.\nProof. Suppose that mx > 0 for some m \u2208 N and x \u2208 G. Since K0 A is a simple\nordered group, there exists n \u2208 N such that nmx > [1A ] \u2208 K0 A. Since drr(A) = 0,\nwe may choose an injective decomposition\n!\nmi\nM\n\u223c lim Ai :=\npi,l (C(Xi,l ) \u2297 K)pi,l , \u03c6i\nA=\ni\u2192\u221e\n\nl=1\n\nwith the property that for every i \u2208 N,\n\u001b\n\u001a\n1\ndim(Xi,l )\n<\n.\nmax1\u2264l\u2264mi\nrank(pi,l )\nnm\n\nFind a pre-image xi \u2208 K0 Ai of x such that nmxi > [1Ai ].

Thus, K0 A is weakly unperforated.\nNow suppose that we are given projections p, q \u2208 M\u221e (A) such that [p] = [q] \u2208\nK0 A. Since K0 A is a simple ordered group, every positive element is an order unit.\nHence, there exists some m \u2208 N such that m[p] = m[q] \u2265 [1A ].

It follows that pi and qi are Murray-von\nNeumann equivalent, and so are p and q. Thus, A has cancellation.\n\u0003\nThis is the natural point at which to prove the next corollary, but its statement\nrefers to the almost unperforation of the Cuntz semigroup W (A); we have yet to\nremind the reader of this notion. As we will have occasion to discuss this notion in\ndepth in section 6, we defer our definition until then.\nCorollary 4.3. Let A be a simple unital AH algebra of real rank zero. Then, the\nfollowing are equivalent:\n(i) drr(A) = 0;\n(ii) A is tracially AF;\n(iii) A has slow dimension growth;\n(iv) A is Z-stable;\n(v) W (A) is almost unperforated and sr(A) = 1.\nProof. The equivalence of (ii), (iii), (iv), and (v) is Theorem 3.13 of [35], and is\nthe work of many hands, including Marius D\u0103d\u0103rlat, George Elliott, Guihua Gong,\nHuaxin Lin, Mikael R\u00f8rdam, Wilhelm Winter, and the author.\nIf A has slow dimension growth, then drr(A) = 0 by definition. Thus, (iii) implies\n(i)\nWe now prove that (i) implies (ii). It follows from Theorem 4.2 that K0 (A) is\nweakly unperforated and has cancellation of projections. Combining this with real\nrank zero yields stable rank one for A (Proposition 6.5.2, [1]). That A is tracially\nAF then follows from [20].\n\u0003\nCorollary 4.3 allows us to view the dimension-rank ratio as a measure of dimension\ngrowth which extends the existing notion of slow dimension growth. The condition drr = 0 is a more natural way to view slow dimension growth, since it has\nhigher analogues in the form of non-zero dimension-rank ratios. As promised, the\ndimension-rank ratio is insensitive to differences between Z-stable algebras, provided that they are simple and of real rank zero.\n5. The range of the dimension-rank ratio\nIt is clear from Theorem 2.3 that the dimension-rank ratio may take any finite,\nnonnegative, and rational value. In fact, more is true:\nTheorem 5.1. Let c \u2208 R+ \u222a {\u221e}. There exists a simple, unital AH algebra Ac\nsuch that K0 Ac admits a unique state and drr(Ac ) = c. Moreover, the stable rank\nof Ac is one.\nProof. We address the extreme cases first. The case c = 0 is straightforward: any\nUHF algebra has drr = 0. For c = \u221e, we use an existing example due to Villadsen.\nIn [36], Villadsen constructs several simple unital AH algebras whose K0 -groups\nadmit a unique state s. One of these, say A, has unbounded perforation in its\nordered K0 -group - for every n \u2208 N, there is a non-positive element xn \u2208 K0 A\n\n\fFLAT DIMENSION GROWTH FOR C \u2217 -ALGEBRAS\n\n17\n\nsuch that s(xn ) \u2265 n.

Abstracting the dimension-rank ratio\nThe dimension-rank ratio functions well as an invariant tailored for the study of\nunital and non-Z-stable AH algebras, so it is natural to ask whether there exists an\ninvariant defined for any unital and stably finite C \u2217 -algebra which recovers (or is at\nleast closely related to) the dimension-rank ratio upon restricting to the subclass of\nunital AH algebras. In this section, we present a candidate for such an invariant.\nOne could, in light of Corollary 5.2, be forgiven for wondering briefly if the\nextended real\ninf{s| K0 A has s\u2212strict comparison }\nmight be the invariant we seek. The algebra C([0, 1]n ) dispels this notion: its K0 group has comparison, yet drr(C([0, 1]n )) = n. There is, however, a different version\nof ordered K-theory, whose prospects for recovering the dimension-rank ratio are\ndistinctly better than those of the K0 -group.\n\n\f20\n\nANDREW S. TOMS\n\nLet A be a C \u2217 -algebra. We recall the definition of the Cuntz semigroup W (A)\nfrom [6]. (Our synopsis is essentially that of [27].) Let Mn (A)+ denote the positive\n+\nelements of Mn (A), and let M\u221e (A)+ be the disjoint union \u222a\u221e\ni=n Mn (A) . For\n+\n+\n+\na \u2208 Mn (A) and b \u2208 Mm (A) set a \u2295 b = diag(a, b) \u2208 Mn+m (A) , and write\na - b if there is a sequence {xk } in Mm,n (A) such that x\u2217k bxk \u2192 a. Write a \u223c b if\na - b and b - a. Put W (A) = M\u221e (A)+ / \u223c, and let hai be the equivalence class\ncontaining a. Then, W (A) is a positive ordered Abelian semigroup when equipped\nwith the relations:\nhai + hbi = ha \u2295 bi,\n\nhai \u2264 hbi \u21d0\u21d2 a - b,\n\na, b \u2208 M\u221e (A)+ .\n\nThe relation - reduces to Murray-von Neumann comparison when a and b are\nprojections and A is stably finite.\nIn the case of a stably finite C \u2217 -algebra A, the Cuntz semigroup may be thought\nof as a generalised version of the semigroup of Murray-von Neumann equivalence\nclasses of projections in M\u221e (A). If A is unital, then we scale W (A) with h1A i. Let\nS(W (A)) denote the set of additive and order preserving maps from W (A) to R+\nhaving the property that s(h1A i) = 1, \u2200s \u2208 S(W (A)). Such maps are called states.\nGiven \u03c4 \u2208 QT(A), one may define a map s\u03c4 : M\u221e (A)+ \u2192 R+ by\n(11)\n\ns\u03c4 (a) = lim \u03c4 (a1/n ).\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nThis map is lower semicontinous, and defines a state on W (A). Such maps are\ncalled lower semicontinuous dimension functions, and the set of them is denoted\nLDF(A). QT(A) is a simplex (Theorem II.4.4, [4]), and the map from QT(A) to\nLDF(A) defined by (11) is bijective and affine (Theorem II.2.2, [4]).\nDefinition 6.1. Let A be an unital and stably finite C \u2217 -algebra, and let r > 0.\n(i) Say that A has r-comparison if whenever one has positive elements a, b \u2208\nM\u221e (A) such that\ns(hai) + r < s(hbi), \u2200s \u2208 LDF(A),\nthen hai \u2264 hbi in W (A).\n(ii) Define the radius of comparison of A, denoted rc(A), to be\ninf{r \u2208 R+ | (W (A), h1A i) has r \u2212 comparison }\nif it exists, and \u221e otherwise.\nWe summarise some properties of the radius of comparison which are more or\nless immediate from its definition. (Compare with Propositions 2.2 and 3.5.)\nProposition 6.2. Let A, B be unital and stably finite C \u2217 -algebras. Then:\n(i) rc(A \u2295 B) = max{rc(A), rc(B)};\n(ii) if k \u2208 N, then rc(Mk (A)) = (1/k)rc(A);\n(iii) if I is an ideal of A, \u03c0 : A \u2192 A/I is the quotient map, and\n\u03c0 \u266f : QT(A/I) \u2192 QT(A)\nis surjective, then rc(A/I) \u2264 rc(A);\n(iv) A has rc(A)-(FCQ);\n(v) (K0 A+ , [1A ]) has rc(A)-strict comparison.\n\n\fFLAT DIMENSION GROWTH FOR C \u2217 -ALGEBRAS\n\n21\n\nProof. For (i), use the fact that LDF(A \u2295 B) is the convex hull of LDF(A) and\nLDF(B) to obtain rc(A \u2295 B) \u2264 max{rc(A), rc(B)}. The reverse inequality will\nfollow from (iii).\n(ii) is straightforward from Definition 6.1.\nFor (iii), let there be given positive elements a, b \u2208 M\u221e (A/I) such that\ns(hai) + r < s(hbi), \u2200s \u2208 LDF(A/I), some r > rc(A).\nWe may find positive elements \u00e3, b\u0303 \u2208 M\u221e (A) such that \u03c0(\u00e3) = a and \u03c0(b\u0303) = b (lift\nto self-adjoint elements and apply the functional calculus). Let d\u03c4 \u2208 LDF(A) be a\nstate corresponding to a normalised quasi-trace \u03c4 on A. Then, \u03c4 = \u03c0 \u266f (\u03b7) for some\n\u03b7 \u2208 QT(A/I) by assumption, and\nd\u03c4 (h\u00e3i) = lim (\u03c4 (\u00e31/n ) = lim \u03b7(a1/n ) = s\u03b7 (hai)\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nfor the state s\u03b7 corresponding to some \u03b7 \u2208 QT(A/I). It follows that\nd\u03c4 (h\u00e3i) + r < d\u03c4 (hb\u0303i), \u2200d \u2208 LDF(A), some r > rc(A),\nwhence \u00e3 - b\u0303 in W (A). This implies the existence of a sequence (vk ) \u2286 M\u221e (A)\nsuch that\nk\u2192\u221e\nvk\u2217 b\u0303vk \u2212\u2192 \u00e3.\nApplying \u03c0 to the expression above shows that a - b in W (A/I), as desired.\n(iv) and (v) follow from the fact that there is an order unit preserving order\nembedding of the scaled ordered semigroup (V (A), [1A ]) of Murray-von Neumann\nequivalence classes of projections in M\u221e (A) into (W (A), h1A i) whenever A is stably\nfinite (cf. [28]).\n\u0003\nThe next proposition is the analogue of Proposition 3.4 for the radius of comparison.\nProposition 6.3. Let A be an unital and stably finite C \u2217 -algebra for which every\n\u03c4 \u2208 QT(A) is faithful. Then, the set\nB := {r \u2208 R+ | W (A) has r \u2212 comparison }\nis closed. In other words, W (A) has rc(A)-comparison.\nProof. If B = \u2205, then it is closed; suppose that B 6= \u2205. As in the proof of Proposition\n3.4, we need only prove that \u03b1 := inf(B) \u2208 B. Let there be given a, b \u2208 W (A)\nsatisfying\ns(a) + \u03b1 < s(b), \u2200s \u2208 LDF(A).\nSuppose first that a = hpi for some projection p \u2208 M\u221e (A). Then, the map\n\u03b3a : QT(A) \u2192 R+ given by \u03b3a (s) = s(a) is continuous. By [24, Proposition 2.7],\nthe map \u03b3b : QT(A) \u2192 R+ given by \u03b3b (s) = s(a) is lower semicontinuous. It follows\nthat \u03b3b \u2212 \u03b3a is lower semicontinuous and strictly positive on QT(A). Since QT(A)\nis compact, \u03b3b \u2212 \u03b3a achieves a lower bound \u03b4 > 0, whence\ns(a) + \u03b1 + \u03b4/2 < s(b), \u2200s \u2208 LDF(A).\nW (A) has (\u03b1 + \u03b4/2)-comparison, and so a \u2264 b, as desired.\nNow suppose that a is not Cuntz equivalent to any projection. By the functional\ncalculus, we conclude that 0 is not an isolated point of the spectrum of a. Viewing\na as the function f (t) = t on its spectrum, we denote by (a \u2212 \u01eb)+ the function\nmax{0, f (t) \u2212 \u01eb} on the spectrum of a. By [16, Proposition 2.6], proving that a \u2264 b\n\n\f22\n\nANDREW S. TOMS\n\nis equivalent to proving that h(a \u2212 \u01eb)+ i \u2264 b, \u2200\u01eb > 0. Let g\u01eb (t) \u2208 C \u2217 (a) be a\nfunction supported on (0, \u01eb) \u2229 \u03c3(a)(6= \u2205), where \u03c3(a) denotes the spectrum of a.\nSince g\u01eb (t) + (a \u2212 \u01eb)+ \u2264 f (t) = a, we have\ns(a) \u2212 s((a \u2212 \u01eb)+ ) \u2265 s(g\u01eb ), \u2200s \u2208 LDF(A).\nLet supp(\u2022) denote the support of a function. Each s \u2208 LDF(A) is implemented\non C \u2217 (a) by a probability measure \u03bcs in the following sense: for any d \u2208 C \u2217 (a),\ns(d) = \u03bcs (supp(d)). Moreover, our assumption about the faithfulness of quasitraces\non A implies that \u03bcs (U ) > 0 for every open subset U of \u03c3(a). Thus, the map\n\u03b3g\u01eb : QT(A) \u2192 R+ given by \u03b3g\u01eb (s) = s(g\u01eb ) = \u03bcs ((0, \u01eb) \u2229 \u03c3(a)) is strictly positive,\nand, as above, lower semicontinuous. It follows that \u03b3g\u01eb achieves a lower bound on\nQT(A), say \u03b4\u01eb . Now\ns((a \u2212 \u01eb)+ ) + \u03b1 + \u03b4\u01eb /2 < s(b), \u2200s \u2208 LDF(A).\nW (A) has (\u03b1 + \u03b4\u01eb /2)-comparison for every \u01eb > 0, whence h(a\u2212 \u01eb)+ i \u2264 b, \u2200\u01eb > 0. \u0003\nRecall that W (A) is said to be almost unperforated if x \u2264 y in W (A) whenever\nmx \u2264 ny for natural numbers m > n ([28]).\nProposition 6.4. Let A be an unital and stably finite C \u2217 -algebra for which every\n\u03c4 \u2208 QT(A) is faithful. If rc(A) = 0, then W (A) is almost unperforated.\nProof. Let m > n be natural numbers, and x, y \u2208 W (A) such that mx \u2264 ny. For\nany s \u2208 LDF(A) we have the following string of inequalities:\n0\n0\n(m \u2212 n)s(x)\nn\n\n\u2264\n\u2264\n\nn * s(y) \u2212 m * s(x)\nn(s(y) \u2212 s(x)) \u2212 (m \u2212 n)s(x)\n\n\u2264\n\ns(y) \u2212 s(x).\n\nThe map \u03b3 : QT(A) \u2192 R+ given by s 7\u2192 s(x) is thus strictly positive (since each\n\u03c4 \u2208 QT(A) is faithful) and lower semicontinuous ([24, Proposition 2.7]). Since\nQT(A) is compact, \u03b3 achieves a minimum value \u03b4 > 0. Now s(x) + \u03b4/2 < s(y),\n\u2200s \u2208 LDF(A). Since rc(A) = 0, W (A) has (\u03b4/2)-comparison. We conclude that\nx \u2264 y in W (A), as desired.\n\u0003\nTheorem 6.5 (R\u00f8rdam, Corollary 4.6, [28]). Let A be a simple, unital, exact, stably\nfinite C \u2217 -algebra with W (A) almost unperforated. Then, W (A) has 0-comparison,\nand rc(A) = 0.\nCombining Proposition 6.4, Theorem 6.5, and Corollary 4.3, we conclude that drr =\n0 and rc = 0 are equivalent for simple and infinite-dimensional AH algebras of\nreal rank zero and stable rank one. We shall see in Corollary 6.7 below that if a\nsemi-homogeneous algebra A has W (A) almost unperforated and spectrum a CWcomplex, then the dimension of its spectrum, and hence its dimension-rank ratio,\nis at most four; by Proposition 6.4, this conclusion holds a fortiori if the said semihomogeneous algebra has rc = 0. If every finite-dimensional representation of A\nis large, then rc = 0 implies that drr \u2248 0. drr(A) = 0 implies that the spectrum\nof A is zero-dimensional; W (A) is then almost unperforated by Theorem 3.4 of\n[23]. Taken together, these results show the condition rc = 0 to be an appropriate\nabstraction of the condition drr = 0.\n\n\fFLAT DIMENSION GROWTH FOR C \u2217 -ALGEBRAS\n\n23\n\nTheorem 6.6.

We now have a closed subset Y of E \u25e6 homeomorphic\nto S 2m , an open set O such that E \u25e6 \u2287 O \u2287 Y , and a continuous map \u03c0 : O \u2192 Y\nsuch that \u03c0|Y = idY .\n+\nRecalling the description of (K0 S 2m , K0 S 2m ) from the example following Proposition 3.5, let \u03bem be a complex vector bundle over Y whose K0 -class corresponds\nto m \u2295 1 \u2208 Z \u2295 Z \u223c\n= K0 S 2m . \u03bem can be realised inside M2m (C(X)). If \u03b81 is the\ntrivial complex line bundle over Y , then the class [\u03b81 ] corresponds to the element\n1 \u2295 0 \u2208 K0 S 2m and is clearly not dominated by [\u03bem ]. Let f : X \u2192 [0, 1] be a\ncontinuous function which vanishes off O and takes the value 1 at every point in\nthe closure of some open set V \u2287 Y such that V \u2286 O. Define positive functions\na, b \u2208 M2m (C(X)) by\na(x) = f (x)\u03c0 \u2217 (\u03bem ); b(x) = f (x)\u03c0 \u2217 (\u03b81 ).\nWe may think of a and b as being contained in Mk (p(C(X) \u2297 K)p) for some sufficiently large k \u2208 N.\nWe claim that hbi \u0002 hai in W (p(C(X) \u2297 K)p). Indeed, since f (y) = 1, \u2200y \u2208 Y ,\nand \u03c0|Y = idY , we have that\na(y) = \u03bem (y), b(y) = \u03b81 (y), \u2200y \u2208 Y.\nhbi \u2264 hai implies that hb|Y i \u2264 ha|Y i in W (C(Y )), but the second inequality contradicts the fact that \u03b81 is not Murray-von Neumann equivalent to a subprojection of\n\u03bem (remember that the Cuntz equivalence relation reduces to Murray-von Neumann\nequivalence on projections in a stably finite algebra). The claim follows.\nChoose a continuous function g : X \u2192 [0, 1] such that g is identically zero on Y ,\nand identically one on the complement of V . Define a positive element v := g * \u03b8n .\nSince v is zero on Y , the argument of the preceding paragraph shows that\nhbi \u0002 ha \u2295 vi.\nThe lower semicontinuous dimension functions on A = p(C(X) \u2297 K)p correspond\nto normalised traces on A. This correspondence may be viewed as follows: each\nnormalised trace \u03c4 corresponds to a probability measure \u03bc\u03c4 on X, and the dimension\nfunction d\u03c4 is given by\nZ\nrank(a)(x)\nd\u03bc\u03c4 .\nd\u03c4 (hai) =\nrank(p)\nX\n\n\f24\n\nANDREW S.

The proposition follows.\n\n\u0003\n\nThe lower bound on rc(p(C(X) \u2297 K)p) in Theorem 6.6 is close to drr(A)/2,\nparticularly when dim(X) and rank(p) are large. If a simple unital AH algebra B\nhas drr(B) > 0, then the dimensions of the spectra of its building blocks and the\nranks of the units of these building blocks must tend toward infinity, regardless of\nthe injective decomposition chosen. Thus, the bound of Theorem 6.6 applied to\nthese building blocks will be all but equal to one half of their respective dimensionrank ratios. One can obtain a lower bound in the spirit of Theorem 6.6 for the\nalgebras of Theorem 5.1.\nThe proof of Theorem 6.6 yields:\nCorollary 6.7. Let A be a semi-homogeneous C \u2217 -algebra with spectrum a CWcomplex. If W (A) is almost unperforated, then the dimension of the spectrum of A\nis at most four.\nProof. We prove the contrapositive. Retain the notation used in the proof of Theorem 6.6. Suppose that the dimension of the spectrum of A is at least five. Construct\na and b as in the proof of Theorem 6.6, and notice that a = \u03c0 \u2217 (\u03be2 ). Theorem 3.1\nshows that\n\u03be2 \u2295 \u03be2 \u2295 \u03be2 \u223c\n= \u03b84 \u2295 \u03b7\nfor some complex vector bundle \u03b7 over Y . In other words, there is a partial isometry\nv \u2208 M\u221e (C(Y )) such that\nv \u2217 (\u03be2 \u2295 \u03be2 \u2295 \u03be2 )v = \u03b84 .\nLet (gk ) be a self-adjoint approximate unit for C(O).

For any r \u2208 R+ , there is a simple unital AH algebra A such\nthat rc(A) \u2265 r = drr(A)/2.\nProof. There is nothing to prove when r = 0, so fix r > 0. For a C \u2217 -algebra\nA, let V (A) denote the semigroup of Murray-von Neumann equivalence classes of\nprojections in M\u221e (A). The algebra A2r constructed in the proof of Theorem 5.1\nhas drr = 2r and stable rank one. It follows that there is an order unit preserving\norder isomorphism\n(K0 (A2r )+ , [1A ]) \u223c\n= (V (A2r ), [1A ]).\n2r\n\n2r\n\nSince A2r is stably finite, there is an order unit preserving order embedding of\n(V (A2r ), [1A2r ]) into (W (A2r ), h1A2r i). The proof of Corollary 5.2 shows that for\nany t < r, there are projections p, q \u2208 M\u221e (A) such that [p] \u0002 [q], yet s(p)+ t < s(q)\nfor the unique state s \u2208 S(K0 (A2r ), [1A2r ]).\nLet d\u03c4 \u2208 LDF(A2r ) be induced by \u03c4 \u2208 T(A). d\u03c4 gives rise to an element\nof S(K0 (A2r ), and so agrees with s on the image of K0 (A2r )+ in W (A2r ). In\nparticular,\nd\u03c4 (hpi) + t < d\u03c4 (hqi), \u2200d\u03c4 \u2208 LDF(A2r ).\nThe existence of an order unit preserving order embedding\n\u03b9 : (K0 (A2r )+ , [1A2r ]) \u2192 (W (A2r ), h1A2r i)\nimplies that hpi is not less than hqi in W (A2r ), whence rc(A2r ) \u2265 t; t was arbitrary,\nand the proposition follows.\n\u0003\nOne wants an upper bound on the radius of comparison of A = p(C(X) \u2297 K)p\nof the form\nrc(A) \u2264 Kdrr(A), K > 0,\n\n(12)\n\nwhere X is a CW-complex, p \u2208 C(X) is a projection, and K is independent of our\nchoice of X and p. (This bound holds already in the case drr(A) = 0 by Theorem\n3.4 of [23].) This would complete the confirmation of the radius of comparison\nas the correct abstraction of the dimension-rank ratio. Applied to the algebras of\nTheorem 6.6, it would show that the radius of comparison roughly determines the\ndimension rank ratio. Philosophically, asking for the bound in (12) is reasonable\n- it amounts to asking for stability properties in the Cuntz semigroup analogous\nto the the stability properties of vector bundles (cf. Theorem 3.1):\nQuestion 6.9. Does there exist a constant K > 0 such that for any compact\nHausdorff space X and any positive elements a, b \u2208 M\u221e (C(X)) satisfying\nrank(b)(x) \u2212 rank(a)(x) \u2265 Kdim(X), \u2200x \u2208 X,\none has a - b in W (C(X))?\nIt follows more or less directly from Theorem 3.1, (ii), that Question 6.9 has a\npositive answer upon restricting to positive elements whose rank functions take\nat most two values, one of which is zero, but this partial result does not address\nthe essential difficulties of the question. Nevertheless, an affirmative answer seems\nlikely. To generate interest in Question 6.9, we outline an application of a positive\nanswer to it.\n\n\f26\n\nANDREW S. TOMS\n\nConjecture 6.10. There exists a simple, unital, separable, and nuclear C \u2217 -algebra\nA of stable rank one such that\nA \u2247 Mn (A), some n \u2208 N,\nyet\n(V (A), [1A ]) \u223c\n= (V (Mn (A)), [1Mn (A) ]) \u223c\n= (Q+ , 1).\nThe algebras A and Mn (A) thus constitute a particularly strong counterexample\nto Elliott's classification conjecture for simple, separable, and nuclear C \u2217 -algebras\n(cf. [26]).\nSketch of proof. The proof of Theorem 1.1, [31], contains a construction of a simple\nunital AH algebra A of stable rank one which has the properties that rc(A) > 1/2,\nand\n(V (A), [1A ]) \u223c\n= (Q+ , 1).\nExplicitly (cf. [31]), one has\nA = lim (Mni (C([0, 1]mi )), \u03c6i ),\ni\u2192\u221e\n\nwhere mi \u2264 ni . If Question 6.9 has a positive answer, then we may conclude that\nrc(A) \u2264 K. Choose n > 2K. Then,\n(V (Mn (A)), [1Mn (A) ]) \u223c\n= (Q+ , 1),\nbut rc(Mn (A)) < 1/2 by part (ii) of Proposition 6.2. It follows that A \u2247 Mn (A),\nas desired.\n\u2737\nReferences\n[1] Blackadar, B.: K-Theory for Operator Algebras, 2nd edition, MSRI Publications 5, Cambridge University Press 1998\n[2] Blackadar, B.: Matricial and ultramatricial topology, Operator algebras, mathematical\nphysics, and low-dimensional topology (Istanbul, 1991), Res.
