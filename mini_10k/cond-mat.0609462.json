Quantum dots realized in InAs are versatile systems to study the effect\nof spin-orbit interaction on the spin coherence, as well as the possibility to manipulate\nsingle spins using an electric field. We present transport measurements on quantum\ndots realized in InAs nanowires. Lithographically defined top-gates are used to locally\ndeplete the nanowire and to form tunneling barriers. By using three gates, we can\nform either single quantum dots, or two quantum dots in series along the nanowire.\nMeasurements of the stability diagrams for both cases show that this method is suitable\nfor producing high quality quantum dots in InAs.\n\n\fTunable few electron quantum dots in InAs nanowires\n\n2\n\n1. Introduction\nSemiconductor quantum dots (QDs) have been widely studied due to the possibility to\nmanipulate the spin of single electrons, and they have been proposed as building blocks\nfor quantum computing [1]. Recent experiments have demonstrated measurements and\nmanipulations of single spins, as well as coupling of two spins, which are the elementary\nfunctions for using QDs as quantum bits [2, 3]. Interactions with nuclear spins are\nthought to be the main mechanism for spin decoherence in GaAs [3]. Other materials\nwith a strong spin-orbit interaction could provide an opportunity to study different\ndecoherence mechanisms, such as spin-orbit interaction. In addition, strong spin-orbit\ninteraction could provide the opportunity to manipulate single spins in QDs using an\nelectric field instead of a magnetic field [4, 5, 6, 7]. InAs is a material with strong spinorbit interaction, and QDs defined in InAs might give the opportunity to investigate\nthese effects.\nAttempts to realize gate-defined QDs for transport experiments in InAs face the\nproblem of producing reliable Schottky barriers, due to the small energy gap of this\nmaterial [8]. For this reason, the method of top-gates, which is very successfull for\nrealizing tunable nanostructures in GaAs heterostructures, is not straight forward on\nInAs. It has been shown that QDs can be realized in planar InAs heterostructures\n[9]. High quality QDs have been realized on nanowires (NWs), either by using Schottky\ncontacts on InP [10] and Si NWs[11], or by epitaxial growth of InP barriers along an InAs\nNW [12, 13]. While these structures could demonstrate quantum Coulomb blockade\ndown to the last electron, one drawback is the difficulty to control independently the\ncoupling of a single QD to its leads or to another nearby QD. More recently, a new\ntechnique consisting of depositing an InAs NW on predefined finger gates covered by\na silicon nitride isolation layer could demonstrate fully tunable single and double QDs,\nbut was limited to QDs containing a large number of electrons [14].\nHere we show another method to fabricate QDs along InAs NWs. We use top-gates\nin order to locally deplete the NW and form the tunnel barriers necessary to observe\nCoulomb blockade. The metallic gates are electrically isolated from the conducting\nchannel of the NW by the native oxide covering the NW after growth. This way, \"half\nwrap-around-gates\" covering a big fraction of the NW's surface are created and they\nare expected to be more efficient than earlier attempts using local back-gates [15]. By\nmeasuring the stability diagram in two configurations, one with a single QD, the second\nwith two coupled QDs, we show that this method is very suitable for producing high\nquality few electrons QDs in InAs for transport experiments.\n2. Samples and experimental methods\nInAs NWs are grown on GaAs h111i substrates by metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy\n(MOVPE) [16]. Au colloids of diameter 20 to 60 nm are deposited on the substrate,\nand serve as catalyst for the growth. Nanowires are 5 to 10 \u03bcm long and the diameter\n\n\fTunable few electron quantum dots in InAs nanowires\n\n3\n\nvaries from maximum 200 nm at the base down to less than 50 nm at the top.\nResults of two different samples (referred as A and B) will be presented, for which\nthe fabrication processes differ slightly. The NWs are deposited on a highly doped Si\nwafer covered by 300 nm of SiO2 , either after being put into an ethanol solution (sample\nA), or directly by mechanical transfer (sample B). The highly doped Si substrate is used\nas a back-gate to modulate the electron density in the whole NW. Ohmic contacts to\nthe NWs are defined using optical lithography, on part of a NW of diameter 150 nm\n(sample A) or 100 nm (sample B). After development, the contact areas are passivated\nusing (NH4 )2 Sx [17], and layers of Ti (thickness 20 nm) and Au (180 nm) are evaporated.\nThis method gives a contact resistance below 100 \u03a9.\nIn order to realize tunneling barriers along the NWs, top gate fingers are defined\nusing electron beam lithography, and evaporation of a double layer of Cr and Au (with\nthicknesses of respectively 10 and 100 nm for sample A, 6 and 66 nm for sample B\nrespectively). No surface preparation is done before the metal evaporation, in order to\nkeep the native oxide of about 1.5 to 2 nm thickness on InAs (see inset of Fig. 1). This\nthickness is comparable to the native oxide measured on InAs layers [18]. This way we\nobtain a capacitive coupling of these metallic stripe and the NWs. Such a homomorphic\ninsulating layer has been shown to produce low quality macroscopic metal-insulatorsemiconductor structures on laterally extended InAs structures [19]. However, we show\nhere that on the length scale of 100 nm, the metallic gates do not show breakdown for\nvoltages in the range \u00b11V and are appropriate in order to locally deplete the NW.\nA scanning electron microscope image of sample A is shown in Fig. 1(a). The three\nfinger gates have a width of approximately 80 nm and a periodicity of 150 nm. Sample\nB has the same geometry, with a width of 60 nm and a periodicity of 120 nm, evaluated\nfrom the lithographic design. The lower limit for these widths is given by the thickness\nof the evaporated metal layers, since a width-height ratio of at least 1:1 is required for\nour lithographic structures. Samples A and B have been measured respectively in a\npumped 4 He system with base temperature 1.7 K, and a 3 He/4 He dilution refrigerator\nwith base temperature 30 mK.\n3. Single quantum dot\nWith all gates put to ground, transport measurements on sample A at 1.7 K show a\nhigh resistance, due to the complete pinch-off of the NW below the top gates. This\ndepletion due to the presence of the gates is not observe with the same magnitude for\nall devices, and could be due to charges trapped in the oxide layer between the metallic\ngates and the NW. The original resistance of the NW is recovered by either applying a\nlarge positive voltage on the back gate or on the top gates.\nIn order to form a single QD, defined by two tunnel barriers, two gates (RG and CG)\nare set to a low potential while the third gate (LG) is kept at +0.7 V. In this regime, the\ntwo-point conductance measured between source and drain shows peaks when sweeping\nright and center gates, which is a clear signature of Coulomb blockade. These peaks\n\n\fTunable few electron quantum dots in InAs nanowires\n\n4\n\nFigure 1. (a) Scanning electron micrograph of the sample A, showing the ohmic\ncontacts labelled S and D, and three finger top gates labelled LG, CG and RG.\nInset: transmission electron microscope image of the cross-section of an InAs nanowire,\nshowing the native oxide layer. The scale bar is 3 nm. (b) Current through a single\nQD formed in sample A at 1.7 K as a function of the voltage applied on the right gate,\nVRG , and the voltage applied on the center gate, VCG . The back gate voltage is +6 V,\nand the voltage of the left gate is kept to +0.7 V in order to keep the lead open. Each\nline correspond to the addition of an electron in the QD. The slope of the lines is -0.6,\ni.e. of the order of -1, as expected for a QD formed inbetween the gates RG and CG.\nThe dashed line is the line followed to take the charge stability diagram of Fig. 2.\n\ncorrespond to the alignment of the discrete levels in the QD with the chemical potential\nof the leads, which allow transport of electrons. The current is blocked in-between\nthe peaks due to Coulomb repulsion between the electrons [20]. To show that the QD\nis created really between both gates RG and CG, the Coulomb blockade peaks are\nmeasured when varying the voltages VRG and VCG , as shown in Fig. 1(b). The slopes of\nthe Coulomb peak lines are of the order of -1, showing that the lever arms of both gates\non the QD are comparable. This proves that the QD is situated between the gates. We\nhave checked that using the gates LG and CG, and keeping RG to a large voltage, it\nis also possible to form a QD between these two gates. We are therefore able to create\nindependently two dots along the NW using the three gates.\nThe properties of the QD can be determined by measuring the conductance at large\nbias voltage. Figure 2 shows the charge stability diagram of sample A, measured by\nsweeping the source-drain bias voltage, and changing the global potential of the dot\nsymmetrically with the gates RG and CG as indicated by the line in Fig. 1(b). In\nthis picture, the white regions correspond to blockaded transport. A finite conductance\ncan be observed either by aligning the potential of the QD with the chemical potential\nof the leads, or by applying a bias voltage large enough in order to compensate the\ncharging energy of the QD. From the size of the first diamond (labelled N in Fig. 2)\nwe determine the charging energy of this QD, EC \u2248 11.5 meV. This energy corresponds\nto the electrostatic energy of a capacitor C = 13.9 aF, which is the capacitance of an\n\n\fTunable few electron quantum dots in InAs nanowires\n\n5\n\nFigure 2. Differential conductance Gdif f = dISD /dVDS as a function of the\nbias voltage VDS and the gate voltage VRG measured on sample A at 1.7 K. In\nthis measurement, the gate voltage VCG is changed proportionally to VRG , VCG =\n0.99VRG + 0.042 V.\n\nisolated sphere of radius R = C/(4\u03c0\u01eb0 \u01ebr ) = 8.3 nm (\u01ebr = 15 for InAs).\nThe large difference between the first and second diamond (from the bottom of the\ndiagram, corresponding to N + 1 and N + 2 electrons in the QD) is attributed to the\nquantum confinement in a spin-degenerate system. The effective mass of conduction\nelectrons in InAs is rather small, mef f \u2248 0.02m0 , with m0 the electron mass. Electronelectron interaction effects are therefore expected to be smaller than in GaAs-based\nquantum dots. It is therefore very likely that the orbital states are successively filled by\nspin-up and spin-down electrons. Starting with N even, an additional (N + 1)th electron\nneeds to pay only the charging energy EC since it can occupy the same orbital state as\nthe N th electron, with an opposite spin. Because of the Pauli principle, the (N + 2)th\nelectron needs to pay an energy equals to EC + \u2206i,i+1 , where \u2206i,i+1 is the quantum\nlevel spacing between the orbital level i occupied by the N th electron and the orbital\nlevel i occupied by the (N + 2)th electron. From this difference of energy we determine\n\u2206 \u2248 7.5 meV. Compared to the confinement energy of a 3-dimensional quantum well,\n\u2206 = h\u03042 \u03c0 2 /(16m\u2217 R2 ), this energy corresponds to a radius R = 17 nm, which is close to\nthe size determined from the charging energy.\nFigure 2 is qualitatively very similar to charge stability diagrams of QDs which can\nbe depleted down to the last electron [21]. In our system, we are, however, not able\nto determine whether N = 0 for the lowest Coulomb blockaded region, since applying\na more negative gate voltage on RG and CG will also close the tunnel barriers from\nsource and drain, which suppresses the current through the QD. In addition, from the\n\n\fTunable few electron quantum dots in InAs nanowires\n\n6\n\nFigure 3. Differential conductance Gdif f = dISD /dVDS as a function of the bias\nvoltage VDS and the gate voltage VRG measured on sample B at 30 mK. In this\nmeasurement, the gate voltage VCG is also changed proportionally to VRG , VCG =\n0.85VRG \u2212 0.124 V. The back gate voltage is set to 0 V. The arrows point on lines\ncorresponding to excited states, and the dashed line emphasizes the transition to the\ninelastic cotunneling. The electronic temperature is 150 mK, determined from the\nwidth of the Coulomb peaks at low bias voltage [20].\n\nsize determined above and the approximate electron density of 1018 cm\u22123 determined in\nthe ungated wire, we evaluate the number of electron to be less than 10.\nIn the measurement done at 1.7 K, the quantum confinement is not clearly seen\nin the excitation spectrum at high bias voltage, probably due to the time dependent\nfluctuations observed in the Coulomb diamonds. These presumably stem from an\ninsufficient screening of the experiment with respect to external noise in this particular\ncryostat, which can induce fluctuations in the confinement potential of the QD. To show\nthat these fluctuations are due to the set-up, and are not intrinsic to the device, we have\nperformed a measurement at lower temperature with a system specially designed to filter\nexternal noise. The measurement of the Coulomb diamonds on sample B at an electron\ntemperature of 145 \u00b1 10 mK, determined from the Coulomb blockade peak width [20],\nis displayed in Fig. 3. This measurement shows a much more stable diagram, and lines\ncorresponding to excited states are clearly seen (arrows in Fig. 3). In addition, we can\nalso resolve a step in the Coulomb blockade region due to inelastic cotunneling through\nthe corresponding excited state (dashed line in Fig. 3) [22].\n\n\fTunable few electron quantum dots in InAs nanowires\n\n7\n\nFigure 4. Current measured through the double QD defined in sample B at 30 mK,\nas a function of both gate voltage VRG and VLG . The voltage VCG is kept constant\nat -120 mV, and the back gate voltage is set to 0 V. The number of charges in the\nright QD is indicated by N , N + 1..., and the number of charges in the left QD by M ,\nM + 1,....\n\n4. Double quantum dot\nUsing now the three gates to form three tunnel barriers, we show that we can form\ntwo coupled QDs. Figure 4 shows the charge stability diagram of the double QD, while\nchanging the voltages on gates RG and LG in order to tune the number of electrons\nin each QDs independently. The voltage on CG is kept at -120 mV. In the resulting\nmeasurement, vertical lines correspond to charging of the right QD (with number of\nelectrons indicated by N, N + 1,...), and the horizontal lines to the charging of the left\nQD (with number of electrons indicated by M, M +1,...). The hexagon pattern obtained\nis characteristic of a double dot with strong capacitive coupling between both dots [23].\nBeyond that, we observe a finite current in the spacing between the two degeneracy\npoints corresponding to electron and hole transport through the DQD respectively.\nThis signature of strong tunnel coupling between both QDs is required in order to form\nmolecular states in this system [24].\n5. Conclusion\nWe have realized few electron quantum dots in InAs nanowires using top gate fingers\nin order to create tunneling barriers along the nanowire. This method allows to obtain\nfully tunable quantum dots as well as double quantum dots coupled in series. We\n\n\fTunable few electron quantum dots in InAs nanowires\n\n8\n\ndemonstrate that these devices are perfectly suitable to study single electron transport,\nas well as coupled systems in the few electron regime.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank ETH Zurich for financial support.
