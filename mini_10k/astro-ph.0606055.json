Sun: interior, MHD, Sun: rotation\n\n1. Introduction\nHelioseismic data allow us to study the structure and rotation rate of the solar interior. The tachocline is a thin transitional layer below the solar convective zone. In this layer\nthe surface-like rotation of the convection zone changes to\nnear-uniform rotation in the radiative interior. The existence and properties of this layer have been known from\nhelioseismic studies, recently reviewed by Corbard et al.\n(2001). The tachocline is known to be extremely thin;\nthe central radius of the tachocline appears to lie within\nthe range 0.69 \u2212 0.71 R\u2299, and its thickness is estimated\nto be < 0.05 R\u2299 (Kosovichev, 1996; Corbard et al., 1999;\nSchou et al., 1998; Charbonneau et al., 1999).\nPrecise values for the parameters of the solar\ntachocline as such mean position, thickness, latitudinal\nand temporal variations, depend on the inversion techniques used for helioseismic data. Elliott & Gough (1999)\nsuggest that there exists a difference in the sound speed\nprofile between the observations and the Standard Solar\nModels. By including an additional mixing layer below\nthe convection zone, they calibrate the thickness of the\ntachocline and they find that the mean tachocline thickSend offprint requests to: E. Forg\u00e1cs-Dajka\n\nness is 0.019 R\u2299 with a formal standard error of about 5%.\nThe observed light-element abundances at the surface also\nsuggest that the mixing process in the solar tachocline is\nconfined to a shallow layer (Brun et al., 1999, 2002).\nMaking use of the most recent helioseismic results one\ncan investigate the temporal variation and the latitudinal\nstructure of the tachocline. Basu & Antia (2001) found\nthat the tachocline is prolate, with the difference between\nthe tachocline position at 0\u25e6 and that at 60\u25e6 latitude being\nabout 0.02 R\u2299 . This is in agreement with results obtained\nby Charbonneau et al. (1999). Basu & Antia (2001) also\nreport an increase in thickness of the tachocline with latitude, but this increase is less significant, though still\nat the 3\u03c3 level. Regarding the dynamical aspect, one\nwould expect temporal variations associated with the solar cycle to appear in the tachocline (Howe et al., 2000;\nBasu & Antia, 2001; Corbard et al., 2001). Howe et al.\n(2000) report that a large-scale oscillation may be taking place in this layer with a period about 1.3 yr. It is not\nclear whether this period is associated with solar-cyclerelated variations, and Basu & Antia (2001) did not find\nany periodic or systematic changes in rotation rate in the\ntachocline region. This fact may be the consequence of the\ninsufficiency of the helioseismic data.\n\n\f2\n\nE. Forg\u00e1cs-Dajka: Dynamics of the fast solar tachocline\n\nThe extreme thinness of the tachocline implies a\nstrongly anisotropic transport of angular momentum\n(Spiegel & Zahn, 1992). Several different mechanisms\nhave been proposed for this transport, but it is now widely\nbelieved that the magnetic field is instrumental in its origin. It is known that an oscillating magnetic field cannot propagate far into the radiative zone. The extent of\nthe penetration\nof this magnetic field is the skin depth\np\n2\u03b7/\u03c9cyc , where \u03b7 is the magnetic diffusivity\nHskin =\nand \u03c9cyc is the frequency of the cycle. On the one hand,\n8\n2\nfor \u03b7 <\n\u223c 10 cm /s the dynamo field cannot penetrate the\ntachocline, and we can expect the tachocline to be pervaded by the internal primordial field. On the other hand,\n9\n2\nfor \u03b7 >\n\u223c 10 cm /s the tachocline dynamics should be governed by the dynamo field. As the associated diffusive\nand Lorentz timescales are also very different, these two\ncases basically correspond to the case of \"slow\" and \"fast\"\ntachocline, discussed in the literature (see esp. Table I in\nGilman, 2000).\nIn recent years the case of a slow tachocline\nhas been investigated extensively by a number\nof\nauthors.\nR\u00fcdiger & Kitchatinov\n(1997)\nand\nMacGregor & Charbonneau (1999) studied the interaction between a large-scale field with fixed poloidal\ncomponent and differential rotation without taking into\nconsideration the meridional circulation. They found\nthat the internal poloidal field of 10\u22123 G is sufficient to\nconfine the tachocline to its observed thickness if the\ninternal field is fully contained within the radiative zone.\nGough & McIntyre (1998) presented a model for the\nsolar tachocline which allows the nonlinear interaction\nbetween the meridional flows and a large-scale magnetic\nfield in self-consistent way. Garaud (2001) performed\ncalculations taking into account the meridional flow and\nthe self-consistent evolution of the poloidal field.\nIn\nthe\nfirst\npaper\nof\nthese\nseries\n(Forg\u00e1cs-Dajka & Petrovay, 2002, hereafter Paper\nI), we studied the alternative case of a fast, turbulent tachocline with a turbulent diffusivity of about\n\u03b7 = 1010 cm2 /s and we presented detailed numerical\ncalculations allowing for the self-consistent evolution of\nthe dipolar poloidal field. It was found that a sufficiently\nstrong oscillatory poloidal field with dipolar latitude\ndependence at the tachocline-convective zone boundary\nis able to confine the tachocline to its observed thickness.\nThis is in good agreement with our analitical estimate in\nForg\u00e1cs-Dajka & Petrovay (2001).\nIn this paper, instead of a dipolar field we consider the\nmore realistic case of a migrating field, studying its effect\non the dynamics of the solar tachocline. After formulating the mathematical problem in Sect. 2, results of our\nmodel containing a migrating magnetic field will be presented in Sect. 3 We also explore the effect of the meridional flow and the impact of varying the diffusivity with\nradius. Finally, Sect. 4 summarizes the main results.\n\n2. The model\nIn order to describe the differential rotation and the evolution of the large-scale magnetic field in the solar interior\nit is useful to write the equation of motion and the hydromagnetic induction equation in a frame rotating with the\nfixed internal rotation rate. These equations can be found\nin the first paper of these series (Paper I, Sect. 2.1).\n\n2.1. Flow Field\nThe flow field was treated in the same manner as in\nPaper I, nevertheless, some additional remarks are taken\nhere. As we mentioned in Paper I, Sect. 3.4, the total flow\nfield can be written as the sum of the differential rotation\nand meridional circulation. While we compute the evolution of the angular velocity with time, the meridional circulation is prescribed in our region, because in this case\nwe focus on the effect of any meridional circulation in the\ntachocline, not on the complex problem of meridional circulation in the convective zone. Recent helioseismic inversions have shown that the outer convective envelope is pervaded by a \u2243 20 m s\u22121 poleward meridional flow. Such inversions currently do not provide accurate meridional flow\ninformation at greater depth, thus we turn for guidance to\nthe numerical simulations of thermally driven turbulent\nconvection recently carried out by Miesch et al. (2000),\nK\u00fcker & Stix (2001) and Kitchatinov & R\u00fcdiger (1995).\nThese simulations generate a mean meridional circulation\nand in these the meridional flow penetrates into the stable\ninterior. In an attempt to incorporate at least qualitatively\nthese observational and computational results, we used a\nmodel similar to that described in Paper I.\nThe strong subadiabatic stratification of the solar interior sets an upper limit to the meridional flow. An elementary estimate discussed in Paper I yields vm \u223c 10 cm s\u22121 .\nOn the other hand Miesch et al. (2000) found that depending on assumed values of some of the input parameters this pattern is a persistent equatorward or poleward\ncirculation in the overshoot region. Accordingly, the flow\nparameters used in our calculations were chosen to produce simple smooth one- and two-celled flow patterns\nobeying the amplitude constraint as before mentioned,\nwhile reproducing the observed flow speed near the surface. For the density, we used the following expression:\n\u0013m\n\u0012\nR\u2299\n\u2212\u03b3\n,\n(1)\n\u03c1(r) = C\nr\nwhere the values of the parameters used are C = 1.2,\nm = 2.0 and \u03b3 = 0.9. The flow patterns are shown in\nPaper I, Figs. 9 and 10. In these cases, the speed of the\nhorizontal motion is \u223c 5 cm/s in the upper part of the\nradiative interior.\n\n2.2. Poloidal Field\nIt is well known that sunspot activity occurs in the form of\nwaves with periods \u223c 11 yr, which propagate from middle\n\n\fE.

In the extended butterfly diagram (Makarov & Sivaraman, 1989), one can see\nthe poleward migration of the magnetic fields indicated\nby the migration pattern of a number of tracers such as\nquiescent prominences or the coronal green line.\nStenflo (1988, 1994) analyzed 33 yr of synoptic observations of the Sun's magnetic field carried out daily at the\nMount Wilson and Kitt Peak observatories over all solar\nlatitudes and longitudes. The observed longitudinal magnetic field has been converted to a radial magnetic field\nassuming that the field direction is on average radial in the\nlayers where the field is measured. This provides an opportunity to analyse the global modes of the Sun. Stenflo\n(1988, 1994) expanded the radial magnetic field in spherical harmonics and he found that the zonal magnetic field\npattern can be represented as a superposition of N discrete modes with purely sinusoidal time variations with\nfrequency \u03c9cyc = 2\u03c0/22 yr\u22121 . Consequently, the evolutionary pattern of the axisymmetric radial magnetic field\ncan be written in the following form:\nBr (t, x) =\n\nN\nX\n\n|al | cos [\u03c9cyc (t \u2212 tl )] Pl (x),\n\n(2)\n\nl=1\n\nwith\n\u03a6l = \u2212\u03c9cyc tl ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere Br is the radial, axisymmetric magnetic field, |al |\nis the amplitude, \u03a6l is the phase lag, tl is the time lag and\nx = cos \u03b8.\nPetrovay & Szak\u00e1ly (1999) found that the latitudinal\ndistribution of the field at the surface reflects the conditions at the bottom of the convective zone, i.e. in this\nregard the convective zone behaves as a \"steamy window\".\nThus, if we assume that the above formula describes the\ntime-evolution of the radial magnetic field at the base of\nthe convective zone, then the development of the vector\npotential is given by:\nR\nBr (r, \u03b8, t) sin \u03b8rd\u03b8 + F (r, t)\n,\n(4)\nA(r, \u03b8, t) =\nsin \u03b8\nwhere F is an arbitrary function.

For the\nsolution of Eqs. (6\u20138) we use the following boundary conditions.\nAssuming the deep radiative core to be a rigidly rotating perfect conductor, we set both B and A to zero at\nthe lower boundary. Both these quantities are also set to\nzero along the symmetry axis and they are antisymmetric\nabout the equator. Furthermore, our upper boundary condition on the poloidal field is the solution of Eq. (4). For\nthe upper boundary condition chosen for the toroidal field\nwe assume that the toroidal field is negligible in the convective zone compared to its value in the tachocline. Such\na hypothetical situation is in line with current thinking\nin dynamo theory, and it may be a natural consequence\nof buoyancy-driven instabilities effectively removing any\ntoroidal flux from the convective zone.\nFor \u03c9 we require axial and equatorial symmetry, and\nat the bottom of the convection zone we suppose that the\nrotation rate can be described with the same expression\nas in the upper part of the convection zone. Since the\nobservations indicate that the differential rotation varies\nlittle within the convection zone and in the deep radiative interior, we can take \u2202r \u03c9 = 0 at the bottom of the\ncomputational domain, so the lower boundary condition\nfor \u03c9 is different than in Forg\u00e1cs-Dajka & Petrovay (2001,\n2002) where \u03c9 = 0 at the bottom of our box.

Same as in Fig. 2, but including the meridional circulation. In left-hand panel the circulation is counterclockwise,\nwhile in right-hand panel it is clockwise.\n\n3.1. Solution Without Meridional Circulation\nIn the first calculations, only the field strength varies\nfrom case to case. The values of the viscosity and magnetic diffusivity chosen for these simulations are identical,\n\u03b7 = \u03bd = 1010 cm2 /s, i.e. the magnetic Prandtl number\nis one Prm = \u03bd/\u03b7 = 1 and the meridional circulation\nis neglected. Several calculations were run with different\nfield strengths and we chose the most suitable case for us,\nwhere the sufficiently strong magnetic field is able to interfere the spreading of the differential rotation into the\nradiative interior and to reproduce the observed thickness\nof the tachocline. This case is shown in Fig. 2 after relaxation 1 .\nIn the left-hand panel we plotted the contours of the\ntime-average of the rotation rate, which is defined as\n\u03a9(r, \u03b8) = \u03c9(r, \u03b8) + \u03a90\nZ t+Pcyc\n1\n\u03c9(r, \u03b8) =\n\u03c9(r, \u03b8, t) dt,\nPcyc t\n\n(12)\n(13)\n\nwhere Pcyc = 22yr is the period of the cycle.\nIn the right-hand panel we plotted the rotation rate at\ndifferent latitudes as a function of radius. We note that\nin Paper I we plotted the differential rotation amplitude\n\u2206\u03c9 in right-hand panels, where \u03c9 was weighted with latitude and \u2206\u03c9 was normalized (see Eq. (23) in Paper I).\nHowever, in this paper we retained the values of the frequency, so in this case the results can be compared easier\nwith helioseismic observations and even the more insignificant variations of the rotation rate are more conspicouos.\nBased on the helioseismic observations we expect that\nthe differential rotation changes to the rigid rotation in\na thin transition region. It is well visible that the prescribed differential rotation at the base of the convection\nzone changes to the near-uniform rotation in a thin layer.\nWe also study in detail the dynamics of the tachocline\nand compare to the observations. Accordingly, the thickness of the tachocline and the change in the rotation rate\nacross the tachocline are defined as in Basu (1997). Thus,\nthe jump in the rotation rate across the tachocline \u03b4\u03a9 is\nthe difference between the rotation rate at the base of the\n1\nColor figures and computer animations illustrating the time development of some of our solutions\ncan be downloaded from the following web site:\nhttp://astro.elte.hu/kutat/sol/fast2/fast2e.html\n\nFig. 8. Latitudinal variation of the tachocline thickness.\nThe solid line represents the case shown in Fig. 2 and the\ndashed and dashed-dot lines respectively denote the thickness including the meridional circulation.\nconvection zone and the rotation rate in the interior. The\nthickness of the tachocline w is defined as the rotation rate\nincreases from the factor 1/(1 + e) of its maximum value\nto the factor 1 \u2212 1/(1 + e) of its maximum value in the\nrange r = rt \u2212 w to r = rt + w.\nThe fast tachocline shows a quite marked latitudedependence in our results, as illustrated in Figs. 3-4. In\nboth figures we also plot the results of the helioseismic measurements from MDI and GONG (Basu & Antia,\n2001). It should be noted that, according to the helioseismic results, the latitudinal variation in position of\ntachocline is significant, while the variation in width is\nnot clear, but the results tend to suggest that the thickness increases with latitude. Since the top of the computational domain is fixed at 0.69R\u2299 in our model, therefore\nthe position of the tachocline cannot be directly compared\nwith the observations. Notice that the thickness of the\ntachocline is close to zero at around the colatitude of 60\u25e6 ,\nbecause at this colatitude the rotation rate is equal to the\nrigid rotation velocity. This region is the so-called corotation zone (Fig. 3). In addition to latitudinal variations, we\nalso investigate the temporal variations in the properties\nof the tachocline, and we find that the thickness of the\ntachocline depends on cycle phase (Fig. 5). This variation\nis not confirmed by the observations, but the helioseismic data set is relatively short. The development of the\ntoroidal magnetic field and the radial magnetic field shown\n\n\fE.

We studied it for the sake\nof completeness.\n\n3.2. Solution With Weak Meridional Circulation\n\n3.3. Varying the diffusivity with radius and Prm = 1.0\n\nIn the second case, we study the influence of the meridional circulation. As we mentioned, the strong subadiabatic stratification sets an upper limit to the amplitude of\nthe meridional circulation (vm \u223c 10 cm s\u22121 ).\nWe use the flow patterns shown in Paper I, Figs. 9 and\n10, where the speed of the horizontal flow is weak. In these\ncases, we considered the effect of the meridional flow on\nthe magnetic field (M2 , M3 in Eqs. (7-8)). The results with\nthe meridional circulation included can be seen in Fig. 7.\nThe poloidal field amplitude used here was the same as\nin the previous case. Notice that the effect of the weak\nmeridional flow of \u223c 5 cm s\u22121 on the magnetic field is not\ndramatic.\nIn Fig. 7 it can be seen that the rigid rotation\nrate is shifted compared to the first case in accordance with the direction of flow. An equatorward flow in\nthe tachocline region increases the near-uniform rotation\nrate, while a poleward flow reduces it. We remark that\nthe lower boundary condition for \u03c9 is different than in\nForg\u00e1cs-Dajka & Petrovay (2001, 2002) where \u03c9 = 0 at\nthe bottom of our box. In these cases \u2202r \u03c9 = 0 at the\nbottom of the computational domain, so the effect of the\nmeridional circulation on the rotation is perceptible in the\nradiative interior. It is apparent that the deep meridional\nflow changes the rigid rotation rate. If we raised the amplitude of the meridional circulation at the upper part\nof the radiative interior (vm \u223c 2 m s\u22121 ), but we reduced\nthe penetration of the meridional circulation \u2013 the meridional motion is in the overshoot region \u2013, the shift is not\ndramatic. This result could play an important role in the\nmodel for the solar dynamo models wherein a meridional\nflow penetrates into the stable layers below the tachocline\n(Nandy & Choudhuri, 2002).\nIn Fig. 8 the differences between the three results are\napparent. Note that the rotation rate in the interior is\nchanged in these cases and we used it to define the thickness of the tachocline. It is well visible that the effect of\nthe weak circulation is not dramatic and chiefly limited to\nthe pole. In this paper the toroidal field strength is higher\nas in the earlier paper and on the other hand the upper\nboundary condition on the poloidal field is controlling the\ninfluence of the meridional motion. In case of equatorward\ncirculation it can be seen that the tachocline thickness at\nthe pole extended and in the corotation zone the peak is\napparent. Both are due to the transport by the equatorward motion. If we assume that in the tachocline region\nthe circulation is toward the pole then the thickness at\nthe high latitudes is reducible. It must be noted of course\nthat the solar dynamo theories favour the counterclockwise circulation. On the other hand in our model we have\nnot emphasized the role of the circulation, but the role of\nthe Maxwell stresses which are capable to limit the shear\n\nIn this section the diffusivity is allowed to vary with radius. In Paper I we only investigated cases where the diffusivities are constant throughout the computational domain. The question may arise that the high viscosity in\nthe deep radiative zone could be a disfigurement to our\nresults? In order to answer, we change the magnetic diffusivity and the viscosity with radius as\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\u22121\nrv \u2212 r\n\u03b7 (or \u03bd) = \u03b70 (or \u03bd0 ) 1 + exp \u0393\n,\n(14)\nrbcz \u2212 rin\nwhere \u03b70 , \u03bd0 is the maximum value of the diffusivity and\nviscosity, \u0393 and rv are geometric parameters. Important\nnotice that the used numerical technique sets a limit to\nthis variation with radius. Namely, the lowest value of viscosity or magnetic difusivity in the domain determines the\ndiffusive timescale as against the time step which is determined by the highest value of these. Hence the very low\nvalue of viscosity gives rise to the extremly long integration times.\nThus, in this case we set these parameters as follows:\n\u03b70 (or \u03bd0 ) = 1010 , \u0393 = 16 and rv = 4.2 \u00d7 1010 , and the\nmagnetic Prandtl number is one Prm = \u03bd/\u03b7 = 1. The\nmagnetic diffusivity is varied with depth between approx.\n105 and 1010 . This variation of the diffusivity, while quantitatively much milder than expected physically, provides\nan opportunity for us to consider the effects of a variable\ndiffusivity without the necessity of impossibly long integration times.\nIn left-hand panel of Fig. 9 it is clearly visible that the\ninfluence of the downwards decreasing diffusivity on the\nsolution is small. However it is noticeable that in the polar region the differential rotation penetrates into deeper\nlayers of the radiative interior. On the other hand the amplitude of the temporal variation of the thickness is smaller\nthan in the case of Fig. 5.\n\n3.4. Varying the magnetic Prandtl number with depth\nUnder realistic conditions, the turbulent magnetic diffusivity in the tachocline should be reduced to the microscopic magnetic diffusivity in the radiative core and the\nturbulent viscosity to molecular and radiative viscosity.\nHowever the magnetic diffusivity is greater than the viscosity and it is less reduced than the viscosity (see esp.\nFig. 1 in R\u00fcdiger & Kitchatinov, 1997), so the magnetic\nPrandtl number is varied with depth.\nAs argued earlier, the low diffusivities often make the\nnumerical simulations problematic, therefore we tried to\ngive a qualitative test instead of a quantitative analysis.\nAccordingly, we used the above formula (14) to define the\nvariation of \u03b7 and \u03bd with radius and the required parameters are following: \u03b70 = 1 \u00d7 1010 , \u0393 = 8, rv = 4.2 \u00d7 1010\n\n\f8\n\nE.

In\nthis case the poloidal field strength is Bp \u223c 1500 G and the\nmaximum value of the toroidal field is B \u223c 6000 G. It is\nwell visible that the penetration of the differential rotation\ninto the radiative interior is strongly reduced in the polar\nregion and the temporal variation of the thickness is also\ndecreased (see Fig 10).\n\n4. Discussion and Conclusion\nThe models discussed in this paper show that the dynamo field dominates over the dynamics of the fast solar\ntachocline provided that the turbulent diffusivity in the\n9\n2\ntachocline region exceeds \u03b7 >\n\u223c 10 cm /s.\nIn our first work (Forg\u00e1cs-Dajka & Petrovay, 2001)\nwe presented an analytical estimate for the strength of\nan oscillatory poloidal field, which is able to confine the\ntachocline to its observed thickness for \u03b7 \u223c 1010 cm2 /s.\nBased on the estimate we showed a simple numerical\ncalculation. A crucial assumption in this calculation is\nthat the oscillatory poloidal magnetic field does penetrate\nbelow the convective zone to depths comparable to the\ntachocline thickness and the penetration is prescribed a\npriori.\n\nIn our forthcoming model (Paper I), instead of the a\npriori prescribed oscillatory poloidal magnetic field we included the evolution equation for the poloidal field, but\nthe poloidal field was a simple oscillating dipole, which\nwas not very realistic. In that work we also explored the\nparameter space a bit more widely by varying the magnetic Prandtl number and the diffusivity, but we did not\ninvestigate the effects of the variations of these parameters with depth. We found that the confining field strength\nincreased with increasing viscosity and magnetic Prandtl\nnumber.\nIn the present work we focus on three shortfalls of\nthe earlier models. First, instead of the simple oscillating dipole poloidal field we study the more general magnetic field structures reminiscent of the butterfly diagram.\nOn the other hand, a more realistic model should have a\nmagnetic diffusivity decreasing significantly inside the radiative interior.\nFor the more general magnetic field structures, we use\nthe results of Stenflo (1988, 1994), where the evolutionary\npattern of the axisymmetric magnetic field can be written\nas a superposition of the sinusoidal, 22 yr variations for\nthe 7 odd modes spherical harmonic components. Based\non our previous works we studied the field strength and we\nfound that a sufficiently strong migrating magnetic field is\nable to reproduce the observed thickness of the tachocline.\nThis agrees with the results in Forg\u00e1cs-Dajka & Petrovay\n(2001, 2002), apart from the fact that the time-latitude\ndiagram for the toroidal field (Fig. 6) is now similar to the\nbutterfly diagram. The lower boundary condition for \u03c9 is\ndifferent than in Forg\u00e1cs-Dajka & Petrovay (2001, 2002),\ngiving us a possibility to study the effect of the dynamics\nof the upper layers on the inside layers. In Fig. 2 it can be\nseen that because of the high diffusivity there is a little\ndeviation in the rotation rate compared to the fixed internal rotation rate \u03a90 at different latitudes. Furthermore\nan equatorward meridional circulation in the tachocline\nregion increases the near-uniform rotation rate, while a\npoleward flow reduces it. Note that this phenomenon is\nsensitive to the penetration depth of the flow into the upper radiative interior. We found that the internal rotation\nrate is not shifted extremly in spite of the increasing amplitude of circulation if the circulation is dominated in the\nupper part of the tachocline. The downwards decreasing\ndiffusivity or rather the magnetic Prandtl number does\n\n\fE. Forg\u00e1cs-Dajka: Dynamics of the fast solar tachocline\n\nnot appreciably affect the solution. Evidently, this model\nis simplified treatment of the turbulence in the tachocline,\nnevertheless it gave us an opportunity to consider these effects. The varying magnetic diffusivity and Prandtl number with depth give rise to a change of the temporal variation of the tachocline thickness. It is shown in Fig. 10\nthat the downwards decreasing magnetic Prandtl number\ntends to reduce the spatiotemporal variation.\nThe main results of present and earlier models is that\nthe dynamo field in the turbulent tachocline by Maxwell\nstresses is capable to limit the shear layer to its observed\nthickness. The next step of this analysis consists in comparing the numerical results in the present work and the\nmodel in Paper I with the helioseismic results. In Paper I\nthe thickness of the tachocline showed the \"pit\" at the\npole, which is not confirmed by the available helioseismic\ninformation, which may be in consequence of the latitudinal limit of observations. In Paper I the poloidal field\nwas a simple oscillating dipole, and the reality of this pit\nneeds to be verified with other poloidal field geometries\nand other parameters. In this paper we found that in case\nof the more general magnetic field structure the polar pit\nis reduced to its half and in case of varying the magnetic\nPrandtl number with depth the pit is almost disappeared\n(Fig. 11). If we use the more general field geometry reminiscent of the butterfly diagram, the penetration depth of\nthe differential rotation into the radiative interior in the\npolar region is decreased owing to the fact that at higher\nlatitudes the stonger magnetic fields stay up. In case of the\ndecreasing magnetic Prandtl number the influence of the\nMaxwell stresses are in the ascendant compared with the\nviscous stresses, so the permeation of the differential rotation below the convective zone at the pole reduces further.\nOn the other hand regarding the dynamical aspect, we\nstudied the temporal variations of tachocline. Due to the\nrelatively short helioseismic data set, the temporal variations associated with the solar cycle to appear in the\ntachocline is not clear. In both models, the vector potential of the magnetic field is prescribed with a period of\n22 years at the top of the computational domain, so we\nfound that the thickness of the tachocline depends on cycle\nphase. However the amplitude of the temporal variations\ncan be reduced if the impact of Maxwell stresses is enhanced compared with the viscous stresses \u2013 for example\nthe magnetic Prandtl number is less than one (cf. Fig. 10).\nAs stated earlier, an important shortfall of these models is obviously the extremely simplified treatment of the\nturbulent transport. If the turbulence arises from the instabilities in the tachocline, then the diffusivities should\nclearly be some, possibly very complex, functionals of the\nvelocity field and of the magnetic field. The next step to\nmodel this would be to use a Smagorinsky-type formula\nor k \u2212 \u01eb model for the diffusivities.\nOther important points what we should consider in\nthe future are the boundary conditions on the magnetic field and the complete dynamo-generated poloidal\nfield, because the conditions in the present treatment\npoorly represent the dynamical interaction between the\n\n9\n\nFig. 11. Latitudinal variation of the tachocline thickness.\nThe solid line represents the case shown in Fig.6 of Paper I\nand the dashed and dashed-dot lines respectively denote\nthe thickness including the meridional circulation.\nflow and the magnetic field in the tachocline and the\nconvection zone (Petrovay, 2000). Many theoretical models suggest that the toroidal magnetic field is up to\n105 G in the tachocline, required to produce sunspots\nin low latitudes (Petrovay & Moreno-Insertis, 1997). In\nour model the peak toroidal field is above about 104\nG, but this may change if different boundary conditions are used or the dynamo-generated field is included.\nDikpati & Gilman (2001); Gilman & Dikpati (2002) suggest that the dynamo-generated toroidal field should play\nan important role in the global instability of tachocline\ndifferential rotation. In future work we plan to develop\nour model along the lines described above.\nAcknowledgements. I would like to thank J. O.
