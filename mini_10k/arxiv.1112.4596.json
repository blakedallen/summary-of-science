Ho1,2\nABSTRACT\nWe present sub-arcsecond resolution HCN (4\u20133) and CO (3\u20132) observations made with the Submillimeter Array (SMA 1 ), toward an extremely young\nintermediate-mass protostellar core, MMS 6-main, located in the Orion Molecular Cloud 3 region (OMC-3). We have successfully imaged a compact molecular\noutflow lobe (\u22481500 AU) associated with MMS6-main, which is also the smallest\nmolecular outflow ever found in the intermediate-mass protostellar cores. The\ndynamical time scale of this outflow is estimated to be \u2264100 yr. The line width\ndramatically increases downstream at the end of the molecular outflow (\u2206v\u223c25\nkm s\u22121 ), and clearly shows the bow-shock type velocity structure. The estimated\noutflow mass (\u224810\u22124 M\u2299 ) and outflow size are approximately 2\u20134 orders and 1\u20133\norders of magnitude smaller, while the outflow force (\u224810\u22124 M\u2299 km s\u22121 yr\u22121 ) is\nsimilar, as compared to the other molecular outflows studied in OMC-2/3.

They have a variety of characteristics such\nas size (0.01 pc\u2013a few pc), mass (10\u22124 \u2013103 M\u2299 ), and outflow force (10\u22127 \u20131 M\u2299 km s\u22121\nyr\u22121 ) (e.g., Wu et al. 2004). These outflows are known to result from the entrainment of\ncircumstellar gas, swept-up by the primary jet.\nIt is well accepted that primary jets are launched by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) processes in the accretion disks surrounding a protostar (e.g., Pudritz et al. 2007; Shang et al.\n2007). They play an important role to remove angular momentum from the circumstellar\ndisk and thereby promote mass accretion onto the central star. Furthermore, recent 3D-MHD\nsimulations by Machida et al. (2008) focus on the outflows/jets at the earliest evolutionary\nphase of star formation, between the prestellar phase and Class 0 phase such as outflows\nfrom the first adiabatic core and right after 2nd core formation. Theoretical works are able\nto resolve the jet launching points numerically. However, observational studies with current\ntelescopes are not able to spatially resolve the region. The rarity of suitable targets (short\nlife time at the earliest evolutionary phase) is a persistent problem.\nMMS 6 (414 pc; the distance to Orion; Menten et al. 2007), is located in the OMC3 region (Chini et al. 1997; Lis et al. 1998; Johnstone & Bally 1999; Matthews et al. 2005;\nTakahashi et al. 2009, 2011, ; Hereafter, Takahashi et al. 2011a is denoted as Paper II).\nMMS 6-main is the brightest and the most compact submillimeter continuum source in the\nMMS 6 region (Takahashi et al. 2009) as well as in the OMC-3 region (Takahashi et al.\n2011). The sub-arcsecond 850 \u03bcm continuum image (Paper II), spatially resolved a massive\nenvelope (0.29 M\u2299 ) and hot gas (\u226550 K) in the central 120 AU. Comparisons with core\nmodels clearly showed the presence of a self-luminous source, which implies that MMS 6main is an intermediate-mass protostellar core at the earliest evolutionary stage. However,\nneither molecular outflow, nor radio jet, nor infrared source has ever been detected at the\nsource center in the previous studies (Matthews et al. 2005; Takahashi et al. 2008, Hereafter,\nTakahashi et al. 2008 is denoted as Paper I).\nIn order to search for molecular outflows and study their characteristics, we have performed sub-arcsecond angular resolution observations toward MMS 6-main in the CO (3\u20132)\nand HCN (4\u20133) lines with the SMA. Our observations have achieved a factor of seven improvement in terms of beam size (\u223c50 times better in terms of the beam surface area) than\nthe previous molecular line studies by Takahashi et al. (2009).\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n2.\n\nOBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION\n\nThe observations of the CO (3\u20132; 345.796 GHz) and HCN (4\u20133; 354.505 GHz) emission\nwere carried out with the SMA (Ho et al. 2004) in the extended configuration on September\n2, 2010. The phase center was set on MMS 6 (Chini et al. 1997, ; R.A. (J2000)=5h 35m 23.s 48,\ndecl. (J2000)=-05\u25e601\u2032 32\u2032\u2032 .20). The array configuration provided projected baselines ranging\nfrom 44\u2013244 k\u03bb for CO (3\u20132) and 45\u2013249 k\u03bb for HCN (4\u20133). Our observations were insensitive\nto structures more extended than 3\u2032\u2032 .8 for CO (3\u20132) and 3\u2032\u2032 .7 for HCN (4\u20133) at the 10%\nlevel (Wilner & Welch 1994). The typical system noise temperatures in DSB mode were\nbetween 200\u2013350 K at the observed elevations. The receivers have two sidebands with 4\nGHz bandwidth and the CO (3\u20132) and HCN (4\u20133) lines were simultaneously observed in the\nlower- and upper-sideband, respectively. We used the configuration that gave 128 channels\nfor CO (3\u20132) and 64 channels for HCN (4\u20133). The corresponding velocity resolutions were\n0.7 km s\u22121 for CO (3\u20132) and 1.4 km s\u22121 for HCN (4\u20133). The phase and amplitude calibrator,\n0423-013 (1.5 Jy ), was observed every 18 minutes. Observations of Callisto provided the\nabsolute scale for the flux density calibrations. The overall flux uncertainty was estimated to\nbe \u223c20%. The passband across the bandwidth was determined from observations of 3C 454.3\nwith a \u223c30 minute integration.\nThe raw data were calibrated using MIR (Scoville et al. 1993). After the calibration and\nthe flagging of bad data, final CLEANed images were made using the AIPS task \"imager\"\nwith a natural weighting. The resulting synthesized beam sizes were 0\u2032\u2032 .82\u00d70\u2032\u2032 .64 with a\nposition angle of -74\u25e6 for CO (3\u20132) and -79\u25e6 for HCN (4\u20133). The achieved rms noise levels\nwere 0.14 Jy beam\u22121 km s\u22121 for CO (3\u20132) and 0.10 Jy beam\u22121 km s\u22121 for HCN (4\u20133), for\nthe 0.7 km s\u22121 bin and 1.4 km s\u22121 bin.\n\n3.\n\nRESULTS\n\nFigure 1 shows the zeroth-moment (total intensity), first-moment (velocity field described in the radial outflow velocity), and second-moment maps (velocity dispersion) produced in CO (3\u20132) and HCN (4\u20133), superposed on the 850 \u03bcm continuum emission (Paper\nII). With the SMA extended configuration observations, a very compact molecular outflow\nlobe (\u223c2\u2032\u2032 ) associated with MMS 6-main has been successfully imaged and spatially resolved\nfor the first time. The outflow has a collimated bipolar structure and the high-velocity\nemission is elongated along the north-south direction with a position angle of -6\u25e6. The first\nmoment maps show that the redshifted and blueshifted components are clearly separated in\nthe north and south directions centered at the MMS 6-main continuum peak. The second\nmoment maps show that the line width dramatically increases downstream at the ends of\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nthe molecular outflow particularly in the HCN (4\u20133) emission. This is further demonstrated\nby the position-velocity map presented in Figure 2 in HCN (4\u20133), where the radial outflow\nvelocity reaches its maximum only at \u223c2\u2032\u2032 from the exciting source.\nNote that the gas distribution and velocity structure as observed in CO (3\u20132) and\nHCN (4\u20133) are slightly different. In Figure 1 (first moment maps), the peak positions of\nthe redshifted components are roughly the same in both CO (3\u20132) and HCN (4\u20133), while\nthe peak positions of the blueshifted component are shifted approximately 1\u2032\u2032 with respect to\neach other. Moreover, as clearly seen in Figure 2, the CO (3\u20132) emission traces only a part\nof gas observed in HCN (4\u20133) with the radial outflow velocity up to 15 km s\u22121 . No higher\nvelocity emission is traced by the CO (3\u20132) emission. Note that the gas distribution does not\ndramatically change even if we smooth the CO (3\u20132) data to the same velocity resolution\nas the HCN (4\u20133) data. It is difficult to explain that the CO (3\u20132) high-velocity outflow\nis fainter than in HCN (4\u20133), if the emissions are optically thin, since the CO molecule is\nmuch more abundant. It is likely that the CO (3\u20132) is optically thick, and may be sensitive to the less dense region, perhaps the outflow cavity. If the outflow walls are stratified\nin temperature but not in velocity, self-absorption by the cooler outer layers may suppress\nCO (3\u20132) relative to the HCN (4\u20133). In this context, we note that the CO emission region\nis more extensive than in HCN. Multi-transition line observations are necessary to constrain\ndetailed physical conditions of the high-velocity component.\nPaper I and Takahashi et al. (2009) did not detect molecular outflows associated with\nMMS 6-main in the CO (1\u20130) and CO (3\u20132) observations. This is likely due to the limited sensitivity and the beam dilution. The 3 \u03c3 mass sensitivity limit was 10\u22124 M\u2299 (with\nthe ASTE 26\u2032\u2032 beam size; Paper I) and 6.5\u00d710\u22124 M\u2299 (with the NMA \u223c5\u2032\u2032 beam size;\nTakahashi et al. 2009). Here, with the sub-arcsec resolution (0\u2032\u2032 .82\u00d70\u2032\u2032 .64), we detect the\nvery compact outflow (\u22482\u2032\u2032 ) with the mass sensitivity limit of 3.9\u00d710\u22127 M\u2299 (3\u03c3 mass sensitivity derived from HCN).\n\n4.\n\nOutflow Parameters\n\nOutflow parameters were calculated from the detected CO (3\u20132) and HCN (4\u20133) emissions. Note that, as we described in Section 2, the maximum detectable size with our SMA\nobservations is larger than the outflow lobe size (\u223c2\u2032\u2032 ), so that our observations are not\nsignificantly affected by missing flux.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nThe inclination angle of the outflow2 , i, is constrained from the position-velocity diagram. We use a simple analytical outflow model as described in Lee et al. (2000). The\ncomparison with these models shows that the inclination angle of 45\u25e6 as denoted by the\nblack curves in Figure 2b, can delineate the MMS 6 outflow velocity structure. Therefore,\nthe outflow inclination angle of 45\u25e6 is adopted in the following discussion.\nIn order to compare the MMS 6-main outflow properties with those derived from the\nother OMC-2/3 outflows reported in Paper I, the same derivations are adopted. Under the\nassumption of the local thermodynamical equilibrium (LTE) condition and optically thin\nmolecular line emissions, we estimate the outflow mass. The excitation temperature of the\nmolecular line is adopted as 30K, which is the typical CO (3\u20132) brightness temperature measured in the OMC-2/3 region (Paper I). Note that adopting the excitation temperature of 100\nK modifies the outflow mass estimation slightly (a factor of \u22641.5). The abundance of the CO\nand HCN are adopted as X[CO]=10\u22124 (Frerking et al. 1982) and X[HCN]=5\u00d710\u22127 (values\nderived in the L 1157 outflow by Bachiller & Perez Gutierrez 1997). The HCN (4\u20133) abundance can be enhanced by factors of 10-100 in the shock region (Bachiller & Perez Gutierrez\n1997; J\u00f8rgensen et al. 2004). In this paper, the maximum HCN (4\u20133) abundance derived for\nthe L 1157 outflow (Bachiller & Perez Gutierrez 1997), is adopted.\nThe maximum radial outflow velocity3 and the outflow lobe size are derived as vflow =\nvmax(obs) \u00d7[1/sini] and Rflow = Robs \u00d7[1/cosi], respectively. The dynamical time of the outflow\nis estimated to be td = Rflow /vflow yr with the maximum radial outflow velocity. The outflow\nlobe size, and outflow dynamical time, outflow momentum (P = MCO vflow ), energy (E =\n3\n2\n/2R),\n/2), outflow force (Fobs = P/td ), mechanical luminosity (Lm = MCO \u00d7vflow\nMCO vflow\nand mass loss rate (\u1e40out = MCO /td ) are estimated. The estimated parameters using HCN\n(4\u20133) and CO (3\u20132) are listed in Table 1, with/without inclination angle corrections.\n\n5.\n\nNature of the Extremely Compact Outflow\n\nIn the MMS 6-main outflow case, HCN (4\u20133) is a better tracer of the morphology and\nvelocity structure of the collimated molecular outflow as compared with CO (3\u20132). This\nmay be because the central part of the MMS 6-main envelope (\u22641500 AU) is extremely\ndense (n\u223c109 cm\u22123 ; Paper II) and hence, the ejected gas is better traced by the higher\ncritical density of HCN (4\u20133), and also because the CO may suffer from self-absorption\n2\n\nHere, the plane of the sky is defined as i=0\u25e6 .\n\n3\n\nWe correct all velocities by the systemic velocity (see Table 1).\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\neffects. Hereafter, we use the outflow properties as estimated from the HCN (4\u20133) emission.\nNevertheless, estimated outflow parameters from HCN (4\u20133) and CO (3\u20132) do not show\nsignificant differences.\nThe high-velocity gas detected in HCN emission clearly shows the bipolar collimated\nstructure centered at MMS 6-main with a projected lobe size of 1700AU (0.0085 pc) for\nthe blueshifted component and 1200 AU (0.006 pc) for the redshifted component with an\ninclination angle of 45\u25e6 . The dynamical timescale of this outflow is estimated to be 33-44 yr\nwith the maximum radial outflow velocity of 35\u201339 km s\u22121 . (The dynamical time becomes\na factor of 1.5\u20132.3 shorter when the intensity weighted mean outflow sizes and mean gas\nvelocities are adopted.) The derived outflow mass and outflow size are approximately 2\u20134\norders and 1\u20133 orders of magnitude smaller than those derived for other molecular outflows\npreviously detected in the OMC-2/3 region (Aso et al. 2000; Williams et al. 2003, , Paper\nI). The molecular outflow detected in MMS 6-main is the smallest and least massive bipolar\noutflow that has ever been observed for the intermediate-mass protostars (c.f., Aso et al.\n2000; Williams et al. 2003; Zapata et al. 2006; Beltr\u00e1n et al. 2008, , Paper I). In contrast,\noutflow force, (9.1\u201313)\u00d710\u22125 M\u2299 km s\u22121 yr\u22121 , and the mass loss rate, 3.5\u00d710\u22126 M\u2299 yr\u22121 ,\nhave similar values as compared with the median values/mean value of those derived for\nthe other OMC-2/3 outflows (FCO =5.4\u00d710\u22125 M\u2299 km s\u22121 yr\u22121 / 2.7\u00d710\u22124 M\u2299 km s\u22121 yr\u22121 ;\nValues are calculated from Paper I). These strongly imply that the outflow associated with\nMMS 6-main is much younger, but otherwise has similar outflow force as compared with the\nother molecular outflows in OMC-2/3.\nThe projected outflow lobe size (\u22481000 AU) is even smaller than the outflows found\nin the protostellar cores in Taurus (6000 AU/18000 AU for the median/mean values; from\nHogerheijde 1998). The smallest outflow ever reported in the previous studies is an outflow\nassociated with a very low-luminosity object (VeLLOs), L 1014L, which has a lobe size of\n\u223c500 AU and outflow mass of <10\u22124 M\u2299 . This source is a proto-brown dwarf candidate\n(Bourke et al. 2005). Detected molecular outflow in MMS 6-main is a factor of three larger\nthan this outflow. However, the estimated outflow force in MMS 6-main is more than\ntwo orders of magnitude larger than that estimated in L 1014L. Furthermore, similarly\ncompact molecular outflows are reported in young brown dwarf stars; ISO-Oph 102 and\nMHO5 (Phan-Bao et al. 2008, 2011). They have outflow lobe sizes of \u223c1000 AU and outflow\nmasses of \u223c10\u22124 M\u2299 , which are similar to the outflow in MMS 6-main. However, their\nestimated outflow forces are on the order of 10\u22128 M\u2299 km s\u22121 yr\u22121 , which is four orders\nof magnitude smaller than those estimated in MMS 6-main. As summarized in Figure 3,\nthe molecular outflow detected in MMS 6-main is similarly compact and less massive as\ncompared to those associated with young brown dwarfs, while the outflow force is much\nhigher in MMS 6-main. If we consider that the outflow force is correlated with the mass\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\naccretion rate as suggested in Bontemps et al. (1996), this result indicates that MMS 6-main\nhas a much higher accretion rate than for (proto) brown dwarf cases.\nThe observed outflows are usually characterized by the jet-driven bow-shock models and\nwind-driven shell models (e.g., Lee et al. 2000). The jet-driven bow shock model shows that\nmolecular outflows consist of the ambient gas interacting with the bow-shock of the jet head,\nwhile the wind-driven model shows that molecular outflows consist of swept-up gas entrained\nby the wide-angle outflow. The velocity structures observed in HCN (4\u20133) emission show\nthe immediate velocity increment at the jet head up to 25 km s \u22121 . This clearly suggests the\nsignature of the jet-driven bow-shock type outflow. Similar velocity structures are reported in\nlow-mass protostellar outflows in the Class 0 phase (e.g., Lee et al. 2000, 2007; Hirano et al.\n2010).\nThe primary jets from young stars are likely launched from accretion disks around protostars (e.g., Pudritz et al. 2007; Shang et al. 2006). Magnetocentrifugal forces can produce\nwinds with large opening-angles, while the magnetic pressure gradients (hoop stress induced\nby the generated toroidal magnetic field) eventually dominate beyond the region around the\nAlfven radius, which provides the collimation (Pudritz et al. 2007). X-wind models can also\nexplain both wide and collimated winds as an effect due to the density contrast within the\nwinds (Shang et al. 2006).\nFurthermore, recent 3D-MHD simulations predict two distinct outflows associated with\nthe early evolutionary stages (Machida et al. 2008). First case is the outflow from the first\nadiabatic core. These outflows have a strong magnetic field and are driven mainly by the\nmagneto centrifugal mechanism and are guided by the hour glass-like field lines. These\noutflows show a wide opening-angle low-velocity outflow (\u223c5 km s\u22121 ). Second case is the\noutflow from the protostar. These outflows have a weak magnetic field. They are driven\nby the magnetic pressure gradient force and guided by straight field lines. They have a\ncollimated high-velocity outflow (\u226530 km s\u22121 ).\nOur observations do not have enough angular resolution to resolve the outflow launching\npoint. Hence, this experiment cannot distinguish between the different launching mechanisms as proposed by theoretical models. Nevertheless, the nature of the observed outflow in\nMMS 6-main shares similarities with the outflows from protostellar cores, such as collimation,\nbipolarity, high-velocity gas, and bow-shocks. Negative detection of the wide opening-angle\nlow-velocity outflow as predicted in the first adiabatic core, is possibly due to the observational limits on the mass sensitivity (Section 3) and the detectable size (Section 2).\nThe extremely compact and less massive nature of MMS 6-main suggests that it may\nbe at the earliest evolutionary phase of the protostar, shortly after its formation. Paper II\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nsuggests that the observed density of the submillimeter source, MMS 6-main, is explained by\nthe combination of a central heating source and the surrounding warm envelope, supporting\nthe presence of a protostellar core.\n\n6.\n\nConclusion\n\nAn extremely compact molecular outflow was discovered toward an intermediate-mass\nprotostellar core, MMS 6-main in the OMC-3 region. The velocity broadening at outflow\ntips, (\u2206v\u223c25 km s\u22121 ), indicates the bow-shock type of velocity structure. The estimated\noutflow lobe size (\u22481500 AU), mass(\u224810\u22124 M\u2299 ), and dynamical time (\u2264100 yr), clearly\nsuggest that the outflow is compact, less massive, and young, while the estimated outflow\nforce (\u224810\u22124 M\u2299 km s\u22121 yr\u22121 ) is similar to those derived in other OMC-2/3 outflows. These\nresults most likely suggest that the outflow is originated from a protostar (2nd core), shortly\nafter its formation. These results are consistent with our recent SMA continuum observations\nat 850 \u03bcm, which imply that MMS 6-main is an intermediate mass protostellar core.\nWe acknowledge the staff at the Submillimeter Array for assistance with observations.\nWe thank Naomi Hirano, Masanori Nakamura, and Keiichi Asada for fruitful discussions,\nand our anonymous referee whose suggestions improved this manuscript.\n\nREFERENCES\nArce, H.
