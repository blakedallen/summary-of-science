Usually\ndifferent defects arise during a manufacturing of mesoscopic conductors and an investigation\nof its effect to the transport characteristics has a practical significance. From other hand\nthe study of the effect of single defects to kinetic coefficients makes it possible to obtain\nthe most detailed information on the electron scattering processes that is important for\nthe basic science. Point contacts and quantum microconstrictions (quantum wires) are one\nof the classes of mesoscopic systems, which are wide investigated both theoretically and\nexperimentally (for review see [1, 2]). The electrical conductance G of such constrictions is\nproportional to the number N of propagating electron modes (the number of discrete energy\nlevels \u03b5n < \u03b5F of transverse quantization, \u03b5F is the Fermi energy), each one contributing\nan amount of G0 = 2e2 /h. The changing of the contact diameter d leads to the changing\nof the number of occupied levels \u03b5n and the G (d) suffers a G0 stepwise change. This effect\nis a manifestation of the quantum size effect in metals, which first predicted by Lifshits\nand Kosevich in 1955 [3]. The scattering processes decrease a probability Tn < 1 of the\ntransmission of n \u2212 th mode and the conductance at zero temperature T = 0 and an applied\nvoltage V \u2192 0 is described by Landauer-Buttiker formula [4, 5].\nThe shot noise is an important characteristic of the transport properties of mesoscopic\nconductors [1, 2, 6]. It is originated from the time-dependent current fluctuations. First\nKulik and Omelyanchouk [7] noticed that the shot noise in ballistic contacts vanishes in the\nquasiclassical approximation, if there is no any electron scattering. In quantum microconstriction these fluctuations arise from the quantum mechanical probability of electrons to\nbe transmitted through it. At T = 0, a bias at the contact V \u2192 0 and for low frequencies\n\u03c9 \u2192 0 the shot noise is given by [1]\nS (0) = 2eV G0\n\nN\nX\nn=1\n\nTn (1 \u2212 Tn ) .\n\n(1)\n\nIn perfect ballistic contacts, in which the transmission probability for every mode Tn = 1,\nthe shot noise is fully suppressed. However even in adiabatic ballistic constrictions near the\nvalues of its diameter, at which the highest energy levels \u03b5N is close to \u03b5F , the probability\nTN < 1[8]. According to Eq. (1) at the small bias the shot noise is the linear function of the\nvoltage V .\n2\n\n\fThe conductance of quantum microconstriction containing different types of single defects\nhas been investigated theoretically in the papers [9]-[18]. The most remarkable features of\nmanifestation of electron scattering process in mesoscopic constrictions with only few pointlike defects are: (i) the effect of quantum interference between directly transmitted through\nthe contact an electron wave and electron waves scattered by the defects and a barrier in the\ncontact and (ii) the dependence an electron scattering amplitude on a position of the defect\ninside the constriction. First effect results in the nonmonotonic dependence of the pointcontact conductance on the applied bias, which was observed in the experiments [20, 21]\nand theoretically considered in the papers [9, 21]. Recently new experimental observation\nof conductance oscillations in quantum contact was reported in Ref.[22]. The second one\nis the reason for a size dependence of the Kondo anomaly of the quantum conductance\n[16, 19]. This dependence is due to a non-homogeneity of the local density of the electron\nstates across of the diameter of microconstriction. In the paper [17] based on a numerical\nsimulation the influence of \"dirty\" banks on the conductance of quantum point contact was\nconsidered and authors had predicted the suppression of conductance fluctuations near the\nedges of the steps of the function G (d) . This effect have been experimentally observed in\nRef.[21] and explained by the decreasing of the interference terms in the conductance, if the\ncontact diameter d is closed to the jump of the G (d).\nThe most important feature of the ballistic microconstriction is the splitting of the Fermi\nsurface by applied voltage [23]. Effectively, there are two electronic beams moving in opposite directions with energies differing at each point of the constriction by exactly the bias\nenergy eV. Because of this difference of electron energies \u03b5 \u00b1 eV2 , a value of a wave vec\u0001\ntor kz \u03b5 \u00b1 eV2 along the constriction depends on eV . The mentioned above the effect of\nquantum interference between directly transmitted and scattered waves defines by a relative\n\nphase shift \u2206\u03c6 = 2kz \u2206z of wave functions (\u2206z is a distance between scatterers) and the\n\u0001\ndependence kz \u03b5 \u00b1 eV2 results in oscillations of transmission probabilities Tn (V ) as functions on V . In this paper we consider an influence of such effect to the conductance and\n\nshot noise in long quantum microconstrictions with few defects and the potential barrier.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II the model of microconstriction and the basic\nequations are discussed. In Sec. III the voltage dependence of conductance and shot noise is\nstudied. The two cases are considered: single impurity in the constriction with a barrier and\ntwo impurities in the constriction without the barrier. The expressions for Green's function\n3\n\n\ffor these cases are given. Also the results of numerical calculations are presented in this\nsection. We summaries our results in Sec. IV.\n\nII.\n\nMODEL OF MICROCONSTRICTION AND FORMULATION OF THE PROB-\n\nLEM\n\nLet us consider the quantum microconstriction in the form of a long channel with smooth\nboundaries and a diameter 2R comparable with the Fermi wavelength \u03bbF (Fig.1). A length\nof the channel L is much larger than R. We assume that the channel is smoothly (over Fermi\nlength scale) connected with a bulk metal banks, to which the voltage eV \u226a \u03b5F is applied.\nIn a center of the constriction a potential barrier (U (z) = U\u03b4 (z)) is situated in vicinity of\nwhich there are few point-like defects in positions ri . The Hamiltonian of the system can be\nwritten as\n\nX\nb2\nb= p\nH\n+\nU\u03b4\n(z)\n+\ng\n\u03b4 (r \u2212 ri ) ,\n2m\u2217\ni\n\n(2)\n\nb and m\u2217 are a momentum operator and an effective mass of an electron, g is a conwhere p\nstant of electron-impurity interaction (g > 0, a repulsive impurity). In a ballistic channel\n\nwithout the barrier and defects (U = g = 0) the wave functions and energies of the eigen-\n\nstates inside the channel can be separated to the transversal and longitudinal parts with\nrespect to the constriction axis z:\n1\n\u03a8\u03b1 (r) = \u221a \u03c8 \u22a5\u03b2 (R) eikz z ;\nL\n~2 kz2\n\u03b5\u03b1 = \u03b5\u03b2 +\n,\n2m\u2217\n\n(3)\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03b1 = (\u03b2, kz ) is a full set of quantum numbers consisting of two discrete quantum\nnumbers \u03b2 = (m, n) , which define the discrete energies \u03b5\u03b2 of conducting modes, and kz is the\nwave vector along the z axis; r = (R,z) . The transversal part \u03c8 \u22a5\u03b2 (R) of the wave function\nsatisfies to zero boundary conditions at the surface of the constriction. The functions \u03a8\u03b1 (r)\nare orthogonal and normalized.\nAccording to definition the noise power spectrum is\nZ\nD\nE\n1\ndtei\u03c9t \u2206Iba (t) \u2206Ibb (0) + \u2206Ibb (0) \u2206Iba (t) ,\nSab (\u03c9) =\n2\n4\n\n(5)\n\n\fwhere \u2206Iba (t) = Iba (t) \u2212 Ia ; Iba (t) is the current operator in the right (a, b = R) or left\nD E\n(a, b = L) lead; Ia = Iba is the average current in the lead a; brackets h...i denotes the\n\nquantum statistical average for a system at thermal equilibrium. In this paper we will only\nbe interested in zero frequency noise Sab (0) . Note that due to the current conservation\n\nI \u2261 IL = IR we have S \u2261 SLL = SRR = \u2212SLR = \u2212SRL .\nThe general formula for a current I through the quantum contact at a arbitrary voltage\nwas obtained by Bagwell and Orlando [24] (see also the book [25]):\nZ\n2e\nd\u03b5T (\u03b5, V ) \u00d7 (fL \u2212 fR ) ;\n(6)\nI=\nh\nwhere is the transmission coefficient of electrons through the constriction\n\u0002\u2020\n\u0003\nT (\u03b5, V ) = T r b\nt (\u03b5, V ) b\nt (\u03b5, V ) ,\n(7)\n\u0001\nand fL,R (\u03b5) = fF \u03b5 \u00b1 eV2 is the distribution function of electrons moving in the contact\n\nfrom the left (fL ) or right (fR ) bank; fF (\u03b5) is the Fermi function, b\nt (\u03b5, V ) is a scattering\n\nmatrix. In general case the function T (\u03b5, V ) depends on the applied voltage V because the\nelectron scattering leads to the appearance of nonuniform electrical field inside the constriction [26]. This field must be found self-consistently from the equation of electroneutrality.\nIn an almost ballistic microconstriction containing few scatterers and \u03b4-function potential\nbarrier of the small amplitude U the mentioned electrical field is small and we neglect its\neffect, assuming that the electrical potential drops at the ends of the constriction.\nIn the same approximation the noise spectrum S (0) is given by [1, 2]\nZ\n\b \u0002\u2020\n\u0003\n2e2\nd\u03b5 T r b\nt (\u03b5) b\nt (\u03b5) b\nt\u2020 (\u03b5) b\nt (\u03b5) \u00d7 [fL (1 \u2212 fL ) + fR (1 \u2212 fR )]\nS (0) =\nh\n\u0010\n\u0011i\no\nh\nt\u2020 (\u03b5) b\nt (\u03b5) Ib \u2212 b\nt\u2020 (\u03b5) b\nt (\u03b5) \u00d7 [fL (1 \u2212 fR )] + fR (1 \u2212 fL ) ;\n+T r b\n\n(8)\n\nwhere Ib is the unit matrix. The first term in the Eq. (8) corresponds to thermal fluctuations\n(the equilibrium, or Nyquist-Johnson noise) and vanishes, if the temperature T \u2192 0. The\n\nsecond part of this equation remains finite at T = 0, if the bias is applied to the constriction,\nand it describes the shot noise.\nThe calculation of the transport properties of the quantum constriction comes to the\ndetermination of the scattering matrix b\nt (\u03b5) .

For\nthe first case the Green's function takes the form:\nG (r, r\u2032 ; \u03b5) = Gb (r, r\u2032 ; \u03b5) +\n\ngGb (r, r1 ; \u03b5) Gb (r1 , r\u2032 ; \u03b5)\n;\n1 \u2212 gGb (r1 , r1 ; \u03b5)\n\n(20)\n\nwhere r1 is the position of the impurity, a Green's function Gb (r, r\u2032 ; \u03b5) is defined by Eqs.(11),\n(16). If only two impurities are situated inside the ballistic microconstriction, the solution\nof the Eq.(12) is\nG (r, r\u2032 ; \u03b5) = G0 (r, r\u2032 ; \u03b5) +\nX\n\ni,k=1,2;i6=k\n\n1\n\u00d7\n1 \u2212 G1 (r1 ; \u03b5) G1 (r2 ; \u03b5) G20 (r1 , r2 ; \u03b5)\n\n{G1 (ri ; \u03b5) G0 (r, ri ; \u03b5) [G0 (ri , r\u2032 ; \u03b5) +\n\nG1 (rk ; \u03b5) G0 (ri , rk ; \u03b5) G0 (rk , r\u2032 ; \u03b5)]} ;\n7\n\n(21)\n\n\fwhere\nG1 (ri ; \u03b5) =\n\ng\n;\n1 \u2212 gG0 (ri , ri ; \u03b5)\n\n(22)\n\nand G0 (r, r\u2032 ; \u03b5) is the Green's function of the ballistic microconstriction (14). Using the\nEqs. (20) and (21) it is easy to find the transmission probabilities t\u03b2\u03b2 \u2032 (9).\nAt zero temperature the nonlinear conductance G (V ) and the noise power S (0, eV ) are\ngiven by the following expressions:\n\"\n\u0012\n\u00132\n\u0013 2#\n\u0012\nX\neV\neV\n.\n+ t\u03b2\u03b2 \u2032 \u03b5F \u2212\nt\u03b2\u03b2 \u2032 \u03b5F +\nG (V ) =\n2\n2\n\u2032\n\n(23)\n\n\u03b2\u03b2\n\nS (0, eV ) =\n\nX\n\n\u03b5F + eV\n2\n\n\u2032 \u2032\u2032 \u2032\u2032\u2032\n\n\u03b2\u03b2 \u03b2 \u03b2\n\nZ\n\n\u03b5F \u2212 eV\n2\n\n\b\n\u0002\nd\u03b5 t\u22c6\u03b2\u03b2 \u2032 (\u03b5) t\u03b2 \u2032 \u03b2 \u2032\u2032 (\u03b5) \u03b4 \u03b2 \u2032\u2032 \u03b2 \u2032\u2032\u2032 \u03b4 \u03b2 \u2032\u2032\u2032 \u03b2 \u2212\n\nt\u2217\u03b2 \u2032\u2032 \u03b2 \u2032\u2032\u2032 (\u03b5) t\u03b2 \u2032\u2032\u2032 \u03b2 (\u03b5)\n\n\u0003\n\n(24)\n\n.\n\nTo explain the analytical results we present the expansion of the transmission coefficient (7) on the constant of electron-impurity interaction g up to linear in g term for the\nconstriction with one impurity in the point r1 = (R1 , z1 ) and the barrier\nT (\u03b5) =\n\nX\n\u03b2\n\n|t\u03b2 |2 {1\u2212\n\n(25)\n\n\u001b\n\u0001\n2m\u2217 g\n2\n|r\u03b2 | \u03c8 \u22a5\u03b2 (R1 ) cos 2k\u03b2 z1 + \u03c6\u03b2 ; \u03b5 > \u03b5\u03b2 ,\n~2 k \u03b2\n\nwhere t\u03b2 , r\u03b2 , and phase \u03c6\u03b2 are defined by Eqs.(19), (17), and (18). This formula is correct for\n\n2m\u2217 g\n~2 k\u03b2\n\n\u226a 1, i.e. far from the end of the step of conductance, where k\u03b2 \u2192 0.\n\nThe oscillatory term in Eq.(25) originates from the interference between directly transmitted wave (trajectory 1 in Fig.1) and the wave, which is once reflected by the barrier\nand after one reflection from the impurity passes through the contact (trajectory 2 in\nFig.1). The amplitude of the oscillations depends on the local density of electron states\n2\n\n\u03bd \u03b2 (R1 , \u03b5) = m\u2217 \u03c8 \u22a5\u03b2 (R1 ) / (~2 k\u03b2 (\u03b5)) in the point, in which the impurity is situated. In\ncertain points \u03bd \u03b2 (R, \u03b5) can be equal to zero and the defect located near such point contribute a little to the oscillatory addition of \u03b2th mode to the T (\u03b5) . In particular, impurities\non the surface R = Rs do not influence to the oscillations of T (\u03b5) , because \u03c8 \u22a5\u03b2 (Rs ) = 0.\nAs a result of the reflection from the barrier the oscillations have the additional phase \u03c6\u03b2 .\nIts dependence on the energy \u03b5 leads to nonperiodicity of oscillations of function T (\u03b5) . The\n8\n\n\fEq. (25) enables to follow the changing in the amplitude of oscillation with changing of\nthe contact diameter. If the diameter is increased and goes to the end of the conductance\nstep, the energy of the transverse quantum mode \u03b5\u03b2 is decreased (see, for example, the Eq.\n(28) for cylindrical geometry). The wave number k\u03b2 (10) is increased and according the Eq.\n(17) the modulus of the reflection probability |r\u03b2 | is decreased. In opposite situation (the\nradius is decreased) the decreasing of k\u03b2 is a reason for the decreasing of the transmission\nprobability |t\u03b2 | (19). In both cases the amplitude of oscillations of T (\u03b5) is decreased.\nThe similar expansion of T (\u03b5) for the constriction with two defects in points r1 = (R1 , z1 )\nand r2 = (R2 , z2 ) without barrier is\n(\n\u0014\n\u0012 \u2217 \u00132\nX\n2\n1 X\nmg\n(ii)\nA\u03b2\u03b2 \u2032 +\nT (\u03b5) =\n\u03b4 \u03b2\u03b2 \u2032 \u2212 2\n2\n~\nk\u03b2 k\u03b2 \u2032 i=1,2\n\u2032\n\n(26)\n\n\u03b2\u03b2\n\nRe\n\nX\n\n(ii) (jj)\nA\u03b2\u03b2 \u2032 A\u03b2\u03b2 \u2032\n\n\u0001\n\nexp\n\nk\u03b2 + k\u03b2 \u2032 (zj \u2212 zi ) + \u03c6\u03b2 + \u03c6\u03b2 \u2032\n\ni6=j=1,2\n\n\u03b5 > \u03b5\u03b2 , \u03b5\u03b2 \u2032 ;\n\n\u0001\n\n#)\n\n,\n\nwhere\n(ii)\n\nA\u03b2\u03b2 \u2032 = \u03c8 \u22a5\u03b2 (Ri ) \u03c8 \u2217\u22a5\u03b2 \u2032 (Ri ) .\n\n(27)\n\nThe last term in square brackets describes the interference effect between trajectory 3 in\nFig.1 and trajectory 4, which corresponds to two scattering by different impurities, and nonmonotonically depends on the energy \u03b5. The discussed above the energy dependence of the\ntransmission coefficient T (\u03b5) manifests itself in nonmonotonic dependence of conductance\nand shot noise on the applied bias eV.\nThe general expression for the components t\u03b2\u03b2 \u2032 (\u03b5) (9) calculated by using the Green's\nfunctions (20) and (21) takes into account a multiple electron scattering by the impurities\nand barrier. It is valid for any values of parameters. Below we illustrate such situation\npresenting the plots for the voltage dependencies of conductance and shot noise for some\nvalues of parameters, which may be related to experiments.\nFor numerical calculations we used the model of cylindrical channel, for which in formulas\n(3) and (4)\n\u0010\n\u03c1 \u0011 im\u03c6\ne ;\nJm \u03b3 mn\nR\n\u03c0RJm+1 (\u03b3 mn )\n~2 \u03b3 2mn\n=\n.\n2m\u2217 R2\n\n\u03c8 \u22a5\u03b2 (\u03c1, \u03c6) = \u221a\n\u03b5mn\n\n1\n\n9\n\n(28)\n(29)\n\n\fHere we used the cylindrical coordinates r = (\u03c1, \u03c6, z) ; \u03b3 mn is n \u2212 th zero of Bessel function\nJm . Also we introduce dimensionless parameters\ng=\ne\n\nm\u2217 g\n;\n\u03c0R2 \u01272 kF\n\n\u2217\ne = m U,\nU\n\u01272 k F\n\n(30)\n\ne = 0.5For\nwhere kF is the Fermi wave vector. We have performed the calculations for e\ng = 1, U\nsuch values of these parameters the amplitude of conductance oscillations is of the order the\n\namplitude, which was observed in Ref.[22]. For the value of the radius 2\u03c0R = 2.9\u03bbF (one\n\nmode channel) the first energy level \u03b50,1 < \u03b5F is comparatively far from the Fermi energy and\nfor 2\u03c0R = 3.45\u03bbF this level is closed to \u03b5F . For the larger value of radius (2\u03c0R = 5\u03bbF ) there\nare two opened quantum modes with energies \u03b50,1 , \u03b5\u00b11,1 < \u03b5F . To illustrate different reasons\nof appearance of conductance oscillations, in Fig.2 and Fig.3 we show the dependences\nof the conductance on the applied voltage for the channel without the barrier (U = 0)\ncontaining two impurities and for the channel with the barrier and single impurity. From\ncomparison of the different curves in Figs. 2,3 we observe that the amplitude of conductance\noscillations is decreased for radius value (2\u03c0R = 3.45\u03bbF ) corresponding the end of first step\nof conductance. In Fig.4 and Fig.5 the voltage dependences of noise power are plotted. We\nremark that, as seen from Fig.4, for the one mode channel the shot noise is the strongly\nnonmonotonic function of V. As well as for the conductance, the amplitude of the oscillations\nof the shot noise is decreased near the end of the first step (2\u03c0R = 3.45\u03bbF ). For the two\nmode channel the S(V ) is almost linear function that can be explained by the effect of a\nsuperposition of oscillations with a different periods. In the contact with the barrier the\nmain part of the shot noise S0 (V ) originates from the electron reflection from the barrier\npotential (S (V ) = S0 (V ) , if g = 0), and it is the monotonic function on V. The small\nnonlinearity of this function arises from the energy dependence transmission probability.\nThe interference of electron wave in the presence of defect leads to nonmonotonic additions,\nwhich we show in Fig.5.\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe have studied theoretically the voltage dependence of the conductance G and the shot\nnoise power S in the quantum microconstriction in the form of long channel (quantum wire).\nThe effect of quantum interference of electron waves, which are scattered by single defects\n10\n\n\fand the potential barrier inside the constriction, is taken into account. In the framework of\nthe model we have obtained the analytical solution of the problem and found the dependencies of the G and S on such important parameters as the constriction diameter, the constant\nof electron-impurity interaction, the amplitude of the barrier potential and positions of impurities. In the general case these dependencies are complex and defined by the expression\nof transmission probability t\u03b2\u03b2 \u2032 (9) by means of Green's functions (20), (21). For the small\nconstant g of electron-impurity interaction and far from the step of conductance the part\nof the total transmission coefficient T (\u03b5)(25), which is due to the interference effect, is proportional to g and to the amplitude of the reflected from the barrier wave r\u03b2 (see, Eq.(17)).\nAs a result of that, at small g and U the interference part of conductance and shot noise is\nproportional to gU or g 2 (for U = 0) for any number of defects.\nWe have shown that the conductance and noise are oscillatory functions on the applied\nbias V and come to the conclusion that the experimentally observed suppression of conductance oscillations [21] could be due to the energy dependence of the transmission probability\nof electrons through the constriction. In the framework of our model this suppression of\nconductance oscillations can be explained in the following way: The oscillatory part of conductance is decreased with the decreasing of amplitude r\u03b2 of reflected from the barrier wave.\nThe reflection probability r\u03b2 from the barrier has the minimal value, if the energy of quantum mode \u03b5\u03b2 is close to \u03b5\u03b2 . \u03b5F . It is demonstrated that in the one mode constriction\ncontaining only impurities the shot noise power is a strongly nonlinear function on V. In the\ncontact with the barrier the almost linear dependence S (V ) has small oscillatory addition.\nWe acknowledge fruitful discussion with A.N. Omelyanchouk.\n\n[1] Ya. M. Blanter, M.
