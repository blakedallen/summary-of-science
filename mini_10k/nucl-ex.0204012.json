In a very short, but extremely successful, run with an integrated\nluminosity of only a few \u03bcb\u22121 , the four RHIC experiments delivered an impressive amount\nof results offering a first glimpse at the physics of Au-Au collisions at the energy of\n\u221a\ns\n= 130 GeV , almost one order of magnitude larger than the highest energy of\n\u221a NN\nsN N = 17.2 GeV available at CERN. Some of these results are new and exciting, some\nare puzzling and some follow the pattern already established at lower energies. A lot\n\u221a\nmore is expected to come from the second run at the design energy of sN N = 200 GeV ,\ncompleted by the time of this conference with almost two orders of magnitude larger\nintegrated luminosity. In addition to that, the 15 year programme at CERN SPS and\nBNL AGS has produced a wealth of very interesting and intriguing results and more is\nstill to be expected from the SPS in the next few years. This combination results in very\nexciting opportunities for the study of matter under extreme conditions and in particular\nfor the quest of the phase transition associated with quark-gluon plasma formation and\nchiral symmetry restoration.\nAbout a dozen of different experiments at the AGS and SPS and four experiments\nat RHIC are or have been involved in this endeavour covering a very broad range of\nobservables. In the limited space of this paper it is not possible to do justice to the vast\namount of available results [1]. A selection is therefore unavoidable and this review is\nrestricted to selected topics on recent results and highlights of the field on: (i) global\nobservables where systematic comparisons are made from AGS up to RHIC energies\n(Section 2), (ii) hadron spectra and yields (Section 3), (iii) excess emission of low-mass\nlepton pairs (Section 4) and J/\u03c8 suppression (Section 5) which are among the most notable\nresults hinting at new physics from the SPS programme (results on these two topics are\nnot yet available at RHIC as they require a much higher luminosity than achieved in\nthe first year), and (iv) suppression of large pT hadrons (Section 6) which is one of the\nhighlights of the first RHIC run pointing to new phenomena opening up at RHIC energies.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nGLOBAL OBSERVABLES\nNch and ET distributions\n\nGlobal observables, like multiplicity and transverse energy, provide very valuable\ninformation. Besides defining the collision geometry, they can be related to the initial\nenergy density, e.g. using the well-known Bjorken relation [2], shed light into the\nmechanisms of particle production[3] and provide constraints to the many models aiming\nat describing these collisions [4].\nThe charged particle rapidity density at mid-rapidity has been measured by the four\nRHIC experiments -BRAHMS, PHENIX, PHOBOS and STAR- with very good agreement\n\u221a\namong their results [5]. For central Au-Au collisions at sN N = 130 GeV , the global\naverage is dNch /d\u03b7 = 580 \u00b1 18. For the transverse energy rapidity density there is only\none measurement, by PHENIX, with a value dET /d\u03b7 = 578+26\n\u221239 GeV for the most central\n2% of the inelastic cross section [6]. Using the Bjorken formula [2] this translates into an\n\n1\n\n\finitial energy density of \u01eb = 5.0 GeV /f m3 2 i.e. 60-70% larger than the corresponding\nvalues at the full SPS energy.\nThe energy dependence of the charged particle density\ndNch /d\u03b7, normalized to the number of participating nucleon\npairs (Npart /2), exhibits an almost logarithmic rise with\n\u221a\nsN N from AGS up to RHIC energies, as shown in Fig. 1.\nHowever, the dependence is very different from the pp\n\u221a\nsystematics also shown in Fig. 1. At sN N = 200 GeV ,\n\u223c65% more particles per pair of participants are produced\nin central Au-Au collisions than in pp. Note also that\nthe large increase predicted by the HIJING model with jet\nquenching [3] (upper curve in Fig. 1) is not observed, and\n\u221a\nfrom sN N = 130 to 200 GeV the particle density increases\nby only 15% [5]. (See also Sections 2.2 and 6 for further Figure 1: Energy dependence of charged particle\ndiscussion on jet quenching).\nThe centrality dependence of the charged particle den- density in central AA and\nsity has been proposed as a sensitive tool to shed light on pp collisions [3].\nthe particle production mechanism: soft processes are believed to scale with the number of participants Npart , whereas hard processes, expected to\nbecome more significant as the energy increases, lead to a scaling with the number of binary collisions Nbin . PHENIX [8] and PHOBOS [9] have reported an increase of dNch /d\u03b7\nand dET /d\u03b7 strongly than linear with Npart (the PHENIX results are shown in Fig. 2 left\npanel) and in the framework of models with these two components, like HIJING [7, 11],\nsuch an increase is interpreted as evidence of the contribution of hard processes to particle production 3 . This is to be contrasted to SPS results where WA98 reports a much\nweaker increase (also shown in Fig. 2) [13] and WA97 an even weaker increase consistent\nwithin errors with proportionality with Npart [14]. Both the PHENIX and WA98 data,\nextrapolated\nto peripheral collisions, are in very good agreement with the pp result at the\n\u221a\nsame s derived from the UA5 data [15]. The increased role of hard processes at higher\nenergies and their scaling with Nbin could then explain the stronger increase of particle\nproduction in AA collisions compared to pp previously discussed in the context of Fig. 1.\nThe importance of hard processes at RHIC energies is a very interesting issue which will\nbe further discussed in this review.\nMore surprising is the behavior of the ratio (dET /d\u03b7) / (dNch /d\u03b7), the average\ntransverse energy per charged particle, shown in Fig. 2 (right panel). This ratio is\nfound to be independent of centrality and approximately equal to \u223c 0.8 GeV . Within\n\u221a\nerrors of the order of 10-20% this ratio is also independent of sN N from AGS up to\nRHIC, implying a constant or a very moderate increase of the average pT \u221aper particle.\nIt is also interesting to note that UA1 quotes a very similar ratio at s = 200 GeV\n[16] but with a rather large error of \u223c 20%. This seemingly universal behaviour of\nconstant energy/particle is one of the most puzzling results. The increase in dET /d\u03b7 with\n\u221a\nsN N translates into an increase in the number of produced particles rather than in the\nproduction of particles with larger ET .\n2\n\nusing the canonical formation time \u03c4 = 1 f m/c. Much shorter formation times, as advocated in\nsaturation models [7], would result in energy densities as high as \u01eb \u2243 20 GeV /f m3 .\n3\nThis is, however, not a unique interpretation. The centrality dependence results of PHENIX shown\nin Fig. 2 have also been explained with a model based on purely soft processes [12].\n\n2\n\n\f<dE T/d \u03b7 >/<dN ch /d \u03b7 > (GeV)\n\ndN ch /d \u03b7 /(0.5N p)\n\n1.2\n\nCharged particle density per participant\n\n4\n\nTransverse energy per charged particle\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n3\n\n0.6\n\n2\n\n0.4\n\nPHENIX\nWA98\nUA5\n\n1\n00\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\nPHENIX\nWA98\n\n0.2\n0\n\n400\nNp\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\nN part\n\nFigure 2: Left panel: Centrality dependence of the charged particle density from PHENIX\nand WA98 [10].

Elliptic flow provides\ntherefore an opportunity to learn about the degree of thermal equilibrium achieved with\nemphasis on the early collision dynamics.\nElliptic flow has been measured at RHIC by STAR [17], PHOBOS [18] and PHENIX\n[19] using different analysis methods and with good agreement between their results. The\nmagnitude of elliptic flow, quantified e.g. by the second Fourier coefficient v2 of the\nazimuthal particle distribution with respect to the reaction plane, is shown in Fig. 3 (left\npanel) as function of beam energy. The strength of v2 at RHIC follows the systematic\ntrend established over a very broad range of lower energies from SIS to SPS. The STAR\nvalue of 6% is approximately 50% larger than at the SPS, suggesting a much stronger\nearly approach to local thermal equilibrium at RHIC.\n\nin-plane\n\n0.3\n0.25\n\n\u2022 STAR Min.

Curves represent\nhydrodynamic calculations with parton energy loss assuming different gluon densities\ndN g /dy [22].\nOther interesting features appear in the pT dependence of v2 shown in Fig. 3 (right\npanel) [21]. Up to pT of 1 GeV /c, hydrodynamic calculations, which implicitly assume\nlocal thermal equilibrium, are in remarkably good agreement with the data, contrary\n3\n\n\fto the observations at the SPS where the experimental results are significantly below\nthe hydrodynamic limit [23]. At higher pT , when pQCD starts to become significant,\nv2 appears to saturate. This behaviour can be reproduced by incorporating in the\nhydrodynamic model the energy loss of hard partons (jet quenching) in a dense medium\nwith an initial gluon density of dN g /dy \u223c 500 \u2212 1000 [22] 4 . This novel feature of jet\nquenching is further discussed in Section 6.\n\n2.3\n\nParticle interferometry\n\n\u03bb\n\nTwo-particle correlation with small relative momentum (HBT) is a useful tool to learn\nabout the lifetime and size of the source at the time of particle emission.

The RHIC results are a big\npuzzle. All HBT parameters have almost the same values as at the SPS. In particular, the\nlarger source size Rs and longer source lifetime reflecting itself in Ro /Rs \u2265 2, expected if a\nQGP is formed [28], are not observed at RHIC. Instead, Rs is very close to the SPS value\nand Ro /Rs \u223c 1 again as at the SPS. These results are surprising and raise questions about\nthe present understanding of the space-time evolution of relativistic heavy-ion collisions.\n4\n\nThis might not be a unique interpretation. In a very recent paper, the v2 saturation at high pT is\nexplained by the two-particle correlation of produced minijets [24].\n\n4\n\n\f3\n\nHADRONIC OBSERVABLES\n\nHadronic observables (spectra of identified particles, ratios of particle/antiparticle\nproduction, absolute particle yields) contribute, together with the global observables\ndiscussed in the previous section, to complete our view of the space-time evolution of\nRHI collisions. From their systematic studies, the picture has emerged of an initial\nhigh density state, which quickly reaches equilibrium and cools down while undergoing\ncollective expansion. Particles decouple when the temperature and thus the particle\ndensity are low enough that interactions stop. We distinguish the chemical freeze-out\nwhen inelastic collisions cease to occur and particle abundances are frozen and the kinetic\nfreeze-out, occuring later and at a lower temperature, when elastic processes stop and\ntransverse momenta are frozen.\n\n3.1\n\nChemical freeze-out\n\nIf we assume that an ideal hadron gas in thermal equilibrium is formed, then, in a\nstatistical model using the grand canonical ensemble, the final particle production ratios\nare governed by only two independent variables, the temperature T and the baryochemical\npotential \u03bcB characterizing the system at chemical freeze-out [29]. This simple model\nworks extremely well and reproduces all data available from SIS, AGS, SPS and also the\nnew data from RHIC. It is interesting to note that the enhanced production of strange\nand multi-strange hadrons, one of the first proposed signatures of QGP formation, is also\ndescribed by the statistical model nearly as well as all other species.\nThe parameters T and \u03bcB derived from SPS and RHIC data are listed in Table 1\n[29, 30].\nTable 1: Chemical freeze-out parameters (temperature T and baryochemical potential\n\u03bcB ) derived from SPS [29] and RHIC data [30]\nT (MeV )\n\u03bcB (MeV )\n\nSPS\n168 \u00b15\n\u223c270\n\nRHIC\n175 \u00b17\n51 \u00b16\n\nThe temperatures are practically the same at RHIC and SPS, whereas \u03bcB is\nconsiderably lower at RHIC reflecting a lower net baryon density (see below). However,\nat both SPS and RHIC, the freeze-out parameters in the T vs \u03bcB plane are close to the\nexpected boundaries of the QGP phase transition. So presumably, prior to freeze-out, the\nsystem was in a deconfined or at least in a mixed phase.\n\n3.2\n\nKinetic freeze-out\n\nThe conditions at kinetic freeze-out are derived from the transverse momentum spectra\nof identified particles. As an example, Fig. 5 shows the positive and negative p, K, \u03c0\n\u221a\nspectra measured by PHENIX in central Au-Au collisions at sN N = 130 GeV [31].\nThe spectra exhibit an almost exponential shape with a temperature T (the inverse slope\nparameter) increasing with particle mass. This qualitative behaviour is independent of\n\u221a\nsN N . It has been observed all the way from BEVALAC up to RHIC energies and can\nbe understood if one postulates that there is collective radial flow on top of the thermal\nchaotic contribution [32], so that that the measured inverse slope T = Tf o + m < \u03b2T >2 .\n5\n\n\fFigure 5: Identified particle spectra measured by PHENIX in central Au-Au collisions at\n\u221a\nsN N = 130 GeV [31].\nParticle spectra are then reproduced with only two parameters, characterizing the system\nat kinetic freeze-out, the freeze-out temperature Tf o and the collective radial flow velocity\n< \u03b2T >. Tf o is basically constant at \u223c 130 MeV from AGS to RHIC as expected if\nparticles decouple at a given density. A constant radial flow velocity of < \u03b2T >\u223c 0.4\nhas been established at AGS and SPS energies, whereas the first RHIC results point to a\nhigher value of \u223c 0.6 indicating higher initial pressure in the system. The resulting larger\ninverse slopes lead to an interesting feature not observed at lower energies. The p and \u03c0 \u2212\n(as well as the p and \u03c0 + ) yields become comparable at pT \u2248 2GeV /c.\nAt the SPS, the \u03a9 and J/\u03c8 (and probably also the \u039e) particles follow a different\npattern [37]. They exhibit stronger slopes than expected from the previously quoted\nformula. This is taken as evidence that these particles decouple earlier from the system\ndue to their relatively large mean free path. It will be very interesting to see whether\nsimilar data from RHIC will follow the same pattern.\n\n3.3\n\nBaryon yields\n\nBaryon yields have consistently attracted interest: (i) the net baryon yield at midrapidity is an important observable allowing to study the amount of baryon stopping (the\ntransport of participating nucleons to mid-rapidity) that occurs early in the collision.\n(ii) the mechanism of baryon stopping is a an unsolved question and a topic of recent\ndebate [33, 34]. (iii) the total baryon density plays an important role in connection\nwith in-medium modification of light vector mesons and low-mass dilepton production as\nemphasized recently [35] (see Section 4).\nThe p/p and \u039b/\u039b ratios increase dramatically from values of \u223c 0.1 at SPS to values\nof \u223c 0.7 at RHIC [31, 36, 37, 38]. Clearly the ratios do not yet reach unity. The system\napproaches net baryon free conditions, but remarkably, still \u223c 5% of the participating\nnucleons are transported over 5 units of rapidity as shown in Table 2.\nFrom the inclusive (i.e. non-corrected for feed-down) measurement of p and p one can\nget a crude estimate of the total baryon density (under the assumption that p and n have\nthe same stopping probability, that pp and nn pairs are produced in equal quantities and\nthat higher mass baryons (mainly lambdas and sigmas) finally end up as p, p, n or n). The\nrelevant quantities for RHIC are listed in Table 2. A similar estimate at the maximum\n\u221a\nSPS energy of sN N = 17 GeV , derived from the feed-down corrected p, p yields and the\n\u039b, \u039b yields [39] gives a total baryon density of dNB /dy = 110. It appears therefore that,\ncontrary to previous expectations, the total baryon density is approximately the same at\n6\n\n\fTable 2: Net and total baryon density at RHIC\n\u221a\nRHIC Au-Au at sN N = 130GeV\ndN(p)/dy\n28.7a\ndN(p)/dy\n21.1a\nNet protons dN(p \u2212 p)/dy\n8.6\nParticipating Nucleons (p \u2212 p)A/Z\n21.4\nProduced Baryons (p, p, n, n)\n80.4\nTotal Baryon Density dNB /dy\n102\na) inclusive p and p rapidity density from [31]\nSPS and RHIC, the strong decrease in nuclear stopping being compensated by copious\nproduction of baryon-antibaryon pairs.\n\n4\n\nLOW-MASS e+ e\u2212 PAIRS and PHOTONS\n\nDileptons and photons are unique probes to study the dynamics of relativistic heavyion collisions [40]. The interest stems from their relatively large mean free path. As\na consequence, they can leave the interaction region without final state interaction,\ncarrying information about the conditions and properties of the matter at the time of\ntheir production and in particular at the early stages when deconfinement and chiral\nsymmetry restoration have the best chances to occur.\nThe prominent topic of interest, both in dileptons and photons, is the identification\nof thermal radiation emitted from the collision system. This radiation should tell us the\nnature of the matter formed, a quark-gluon plasma (QGP) or a high-density hadron gas\n(HG). The physics potential of low-mass dileptons is further augmented by their sensitivity\nto chiral symmetry restoration. The \u03c1-meson is the prime agent here. Due to its very short\nlifetime (\u03c4 = 1.3 f m/c) compared to the typical fireball lifetime of \u223c 10 f m/c at SPS\nenergies, most of the \u03c1 mesons decay inside the interaction region providing a unique\nopportunity to observe in-medium modifications of particle properties (mass and/or\nwidth) which might be linked to chiral symmetry restoration. The situation is different\nfor the \u03c9 and \u03c6 mesons. Because of their much longer lifetimes they predominantly decay\noutside the interaction region after having regained their vacuum properties. The \u03c9 and\n\u03c6 mesons remain nevertheless important messengers: the undisturbed \u03c9 can serve as a\nreference and the \u03c6 with its ss content is a probe of strangeness production.\nFor the moment, the stage for low-mass dileptons belongs to CERN and more\nspecifically to the CERES experiment. CERES has systematically studied the production\nof e+ e\u2212 pairs in the mass region m \u2264 1.0 GeV /c2 , with measurements of p-Be, p-Au,\n[41, 42], S-Au [43] and Pb-Au [45, 46, 20]. Whereas the p data are well reproduced\nby the known hadronic sources, a strong enhancement is observed in the mass region\n200 < m < 600 MeV /c2 both in the S and Pb data with respect to those sources scaled\nto the nuclear case with the event multiplicity. Fig. 6 (left panel) shows the results from\nPb-Au collisions at 40 A GeV with an enhancement factor of 5.1 \u00b1 1.3(stat.) relative\nto the hadronic cocktail. Within uncertainties, this is consistent with, or even larger\nthan, the enhancement factor of 2.9 \u00b1 0.3(stat.) \u00b1 0.6(syst.) obtained from the combined\n7\n\n\f\u03c3/\u03c3geo\u2248 30 %\n\nPreliminary\n\n2.1<\u03b7 <2.65\npt>200 MeV/c\n\u0398ee>35 mrad\n\n-6\n\n10\n\n\u2192\n\n10\n\n\u03b3\n\n\u03c9\u2192\n\n-7\n\n-8\n\nee\n\n\u03c00\n\n\u03b7\n\n\u2044\n\n\u2192\n\nee\n\n\u03b3\n\n10\n\n-5\n\n-9\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\nCERES/NA45\npt>0.2GeV\n2.1<\u03b7<2.65\n\u0398ee>35mrad\n\n-6\n\n-7\n\n-8\n\n0.0\n\n2\n\nm ee (GeV/c )\n\nPb(158AGeV)+Au\n<Nch>=250\n\n2\n\n10\n\nee\n\n\u03c6\u2192ee\n\n\u03b7\n\n\u03c9\u2192ee\n\n10\n\n<dNch/d \u03b7 >=216\n\n-5\n\n\u03c1\u2192ee\n\n10\n\n\u03c00\u2192ee \u03b3\n\n<dNee/dm ee>/<Nch > (100 MeV/c )\n\nPb-Au 40 AGeV\n\n(d Nee/d\u03b7dM) / (dNch/d\u03b7) [100MeV]\n\nCERES/NA45\n\n-1\n\n-4\n\n2 -1\n\n10\n\n'96 Data\nCocktail\nCktl + free \u03c0\u03c0\nCktl + in-med. \u03c0\u03c0\nCktl + dropping \u03c1-mass\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\nMee [GeV]\n\nFigure 6: Left panel: Invariant mass e+ e\u2212 spectrum measured by CERES in 40 A GeV\nPb-Au collisions [20].

Right panel: Comparison of CERES 96 results from\nPb-Au collisions at 158 A GeV with various theoretical approaches (see text).\n95-96 Pb-Au data at 158 A GeV . Further studies on the latter demonstrate that the\nenhancement is more pronounced at low pair pT and increases faster than linearly with\nthe event multiplicity. In all cases, with the S and Pb beam, the enhancement sets at\nm \u2265 2m\u03c0 .\nThe enhancement of low-mass dileptons has triggered a wealth of theoretical activity\n(for a comprehensive review see [47]). There is consensus that a simple superposition\nof pp collisions cannot explain the data and that an additional source is needed. The\npion annihilation channel (\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u2192 \u03c1 \u2192 l+ l\u2212 ), obviously irrelevant in pp collisions,\nhas to be added in the nuclear case. This channel accounts for a large fraction of the\nobserved enhancement (see line cocktail + free \u03c0\u03c0 in Fig. 6 right panel) and provides first\nevidence of thermal radiation from a dense hadron gas. However, in order to quantitatively\nreproduce the data in the mass region 0.2 < me+ e\u2212 < 0.6 GeV /c2 , it was found necessary\nto include in-medium modifications of the \u03c1 meson. Li, Ko and Brown [48], following the\noriginal Brown-Rho scaling [49], proposed a decrease of the \u03c1-mass in the high baryon\ndensity of the fireball, as a precursor of chiral symmetry restoration, and achieved excellent\nagreement with the CERES data (see the line cocktail + dropping mass in Fig. 6 right\npanel).\nAnother avenue, based on effective Lagrangians, uses the broadening of the \u03c1-meson\nspectral function resulting from its propagation in the medium, mainly from scattering\noff baryons [50], and achieves also an excellent reproduction of the CERES data (see\nline cocktail + in-medium \u03c0\u03c0 in Fig. 6 right panel). The success of these two different\napproaches, one relying on quark degrees of freedom and the other on a pure hadronic\nmodel, has attracted much interest. Rapp raised, and provided support for, the hypothesis\nof quark-hadron duality down to low-masses by showing that in a high density state the\ndilepton production rates calculated with the in-medium \u03c1-meson spectral function are\nvery similar to the qq annihilation rates calculated in pQCD [51]. It is interesting to note\nthat the 40 A GeV data is also equally well reproduced by the two approaches [20]. The\naccuracy of the data does not allow to discriminate among the two. The CERES run of\nyear 2000 taken with improved mass resolution and good statistics may allow to do that.\nThe extension of these studies to RHIC energies should be very interesting. The\ntotal baryon density, which is the key factor responsible for in-medium modifications\n8\n\n\fof the \u03c1 meson both in the dropping mass and the collision broadening scenarios, is\nalmost as high at RHIC as at SPS (cf. Section 3.3), contrary to previous expectations.\nUpdated RHIC predictions that incorporate this and other acquired knowledge on global\nand hadronic observables, show indeed that the enhancement of low-mass e+ e\u2212 pairs\npersist at the collider with at least comparable strength [52]. The calculations further\npredict in-medium modifications of the \u03c9 and \u03c6 mesons. These are much less dramatic\nthan in the case of the \u03c1 meson but should nevertheless be readily observable with the\nexcellent mass resolution of the PHENIX detector. First results on single electrons from\nPHENIX are already available [53] and results on the \u03c6 meson from the second RHIC\nrun are expected soon. The combined analysis of \u03c6 \u2192 K + K \u2212 and \u03c6 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 within the\nsame apparatus should provide a very powerful diagnostic tool to make evident in-medium\neffects.\nDirect photons are expected to provide analogous information to thermal dileptons.\nHowever, the physics background for real photons is larger by orders of magnitude\ncompared to dileptons making the measurement of photons much tougher and less\nsensitive to a new source. And indeed, only a small direct photon signal of \u223c 20%\nhas been observed in central Pb-Au collisions by the WA98 experiment [54]. The better\nconditions at RHIC, larger particle densities and hence larger initial temperatures should\nprovide a more compelling evidence of this key signal.\n\n5\n\nJ/\u03c8 SUPPRESSION\n\nMeasured / Expected J/\u03c8 suppression\n\nThe melting of charmonium states in a deconfined state of matter is one of the earliest\nsignatures of QGP formation [55] and has provided one of the most exciting sagas of\nthe SPS programme. Already in the first runs with O and S beams, the NA38/NA50\nexperiment observed a suppression of J/\u03c8 which immediately captured the interest.\nIntensive theoretical efforts were devoted to explain the effect within conventional physics\nand it soon appeared that all experimental data, including\n1.4\nsystematic studies of pp, pA and SU collisions, can be\n1.2\nreproduced by invoking the absorption in nuclear medium\n1\nof the cc pair before it forms a J/\u03c8, with a cross section\n0.8\n\u03c3abs = 6.4 \u00b1 0.8mb [56].\n0.6\nHowever, a different behavior is observed with the\n0.4\n158 A GeV Pb beam. Whereas peripheral collisions seem to\n0.2\nfollow the regular absorption pattern, an anomalously larger\n0\nsuppression occurs at central collisions characterized by\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3\n3.5\n\u03b5 (GeV/fm )\nimpact parameters b < 8 f m or ET > 40 GeV which can be\ntranslated into a Bjorken energy density \u01eb > 2.3 GeV /f m3\n(see Fig. 7) [57]. The data in this figure exhibit a two-step Figure 7: Measured over\nsuppression pattern which NA50 attributes to the successive expected (assuming normal\nmelting of the \u03c7c and directly produced J/\u03c8 mesons in a absorption cross section)\nJ/\u03c8 yield vs. energy denquark-gluon plasma scenario.\nThe same data normalized to the Drell-Yan cross section sity [57].\nare shown in Fig. 8 as function of ET .

The model of\nBlaizot et al. reproduce the data remarkably well by invoking J/\u03c8 suppression whenever\nthe energy density exceeds the critical value for deconfinement (first step) together with\nfluctuations of the transverse energy for the most central collisions (second step) [59].\nThe extrapolation of these results to RHIC energies is not at all clear and ranges\nfrom total suppression up to enhancement ! [60] thus ensuring another exciting chapter\non the J/\u03c8 saga. First glimpse on J/\u03c8 production at RHIC is expected from the PHENIX\nresults of year 2 run.\n\n6\n\nSUPPRESSION OF LARGE pT HADRONS\n\nWith the energies available at RHIC, one order of magnitude higher than at the SPS,\nnew channels and probes become accessible for matter diagnostics. In particular, energy\nloss through gluon radiation of high pT partons resulting from initial hard scattering\nand jet production has been predicted as a possible signature of deconfined matter. The\nphenomenon, commonly referred to as jet quenching, has been extensively studied over\nthe last decade [63] and should manifest itself as a suppression of high pT particles. Such\na suppression has been observed already in the first low-luminosity RHIC run by the\ntwo large experiments STAR [21] and PHENIX [64] and certainly constitutes the most\ninteresting result from RHIC so far. The suppression is evidenced by plotting the so-called\nnuclear modification factor[65] defined as the ratio of AA to pp pT spectra, scaled by the\nnumber of binary collisions:\nRAA (pT ) =\n\nd2 \u03c3AA /dpT d\u03b7\n< Nbin > d2 \u03c3pp /dpT d\u03b7\n\nIn the absence of any new physics this ratio should be equal to 1 at the high pT\ncharacteristic of hard processes. At low pT , dominated by soft processes which scale\nwith the number of participants, the ratio is expected to be lower, e.g. for central\n10\n\n\fRAA\n\ncollisions RAA (0) \u2248 0.5Npart /Nbin \u2248 0.2. The STAR and PHENIX results for central\n\u221a\nAu-Au collisions at sN N = 130 GeV are shown in Fig. 9. In both cases the pp data\nat 130 GeV were derived from interpolation of pp data [16, 66, 67] at lower and higher\nenergies.

As expected, for low pT the ratio is small, \u2248 0.2. It raises with pT ,\ngetting close to unity and then falls off at higher pT in the STAR data whereas it seems\nto flatten in the PHENIX data. The suppression appears to be stronger for \u03c0 o than for\ncharged particles. This implies that the ratio \u03c0 o /h is considerably smaller than unity and\nreflects the large p, p contribution to the charged particle spectra at high momentum (cf.\nSection 3.2). A similar suppression pattern appears when the ratio of central to peripheral\ncollisions, each divided by its corresponding value of Nbin , is plotted as function of pT [64].\nThis behaviour is in marked contrast to the observations in Pb-Pb and Pb-Au collisions\nat the SPS (the solid lines in Fig. 9 right panel represent the band of uncertainty of\nthe CERN results) where the ratio overshoots unity and saturates at high pT , like in pA\ncollisions [65] due to the well known Cronin effect [68]. The high pT suppression observed\nat RHIC can be quantitatively reproduced in terms of jet quenching if an average energy\nloss of dE/dx \u2248 0.25 GeV /f m is assumed within a parton model[69].\nIn the context of the new RHIC data, jet quenching has been discussed in three\ndifferent topics (cf. Sections 2.1, 2.2 and this Section). Whereas the phenomenon helps\ndescribing the observed effects in elliptic flow and high pT suppression, the expected\nincrease in particle production has not been observed (cf. Section 2.1). Fine tuning of the\ntheoretical treatment to achieve consistent description of all these observables together\nwith new RHIC data allowing to reach much higher pT values and reference data on pp\nand pA measured within the same apparatus will be very valuable to consolidate these\nintriguing results.\n\n7\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn a relatively short run, the RHIC experiments have produced an impressive amount of\nresults and much more is expected over the next years. The second RHIC run has just\nbeen completed with a recorded luminosity almost two orders of magnitude larger than\n11\n\n\fin year-1. This, together with the still ongoing yield of interesting results from the SPS\nprogramme, places the field of relativistic heavy-ion collisions at a very unique phase with\nexciting physics prospects.\n\nReferences\n[1] Proceedings of Quark Matter 2001 in Nucl.
