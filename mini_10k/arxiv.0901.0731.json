The gradual disappearance\nof the QPO harmonic, and the slowly decreasing hard X-ray flux, imply that the accretion disc slowly moved inwards during the HS.\nKey words.

Introduction\nThe X-ray nova H1743\u2212322 was discovered during a bright\noutburst that occurred in 1977 with the Ariel V and HEAO I\nsatellites by Kaluzienski & Holt (1977). In 2003, another bright\noutburst was first detected with INTEGRAL, and the source\nwas then dubbed IGR J17464\u22123213, before it was realised\nthat it was H1743\u2212322 (Markwardt & Swank 2003). This outburst has been studied considerably at all wavelengths (see e.g.\nParmar et al. 2003; Lutovinov et al. 2005; Kalemci et al. 2006).\nIt was shown in particular that H1743\u2212322 had a behaviour consistent with most black-hole X-ray transients, and was, thus,\nclassified as a Black-Hole Candidate. This 2003 outburst was\nfollowed by weaker episodes in 2004, 2005, and in the first\nmonths of 2008 (see Kalemci et al. 2008).\nA new outburst was detected on 2008 September 23\n(Kuulkers et al. 2008), during INTEGRAL observations of the\nGalactic Bulge (GB). The source brightened above the detec\u22c6\n\non behalf of the INTEGRAL Galactic bulge monitoring team\n\ntion limit in the middle of the INTEGRAL observation, and\nthus provided us with the rare privilege of observing an X-ray\nnova during the very first stages of an outburst, from the quiescent state to the rising phase. Due to this early notice, several\nhigh energy satellites were able to follow rapidly H1743\u2212322:\nINTEGRAL and RXTE observations occurred almost every second day, while at softer X-rays, Swift (XRT) and XMM/Newton\nprovided 3 and 1 observations, respectively.\nHerein, we present the results of the X and \u03b3\u2013ray coverage of\nthe source in its Hard State (HS) until its transition to the Hard\nIntermediate State (HIMS, see e.g. Homan & Belloni 2005),\nwhich is characterized by a photon index between \u223c1.5-2.5,\nand the presence of strong type C Quasi Periodic Oscillations\n(QPOs). Our study is focused on the very first stages of its evolution from quiescence to outburst. We analyse the spectral and\ntiming characteristics of H1743\u2212322, and compare its behaviour\nwith that of the well-studied 2003 outbust. The outburst remains\nongoing while this letter is being written, and the study of the\ncomplete outburst is deferred to a future investigation.\n\n\fL.

The periods of the observations used\nin this paper are indicated for each instrument.\n\n2. Observations and data reduction\nThe INTEGRAL observations analysed here originate in two\ndifferent programmes. The Galactic Bulge (GB) programme\n(Kuulkers et al. 2007) is performed once every INTEGRAL revolution whenever the region is visible, and consists of 12.6 ks\nexposure observations. The Galactic Centre (GC) programme\nprovides longer exposures, of duration typically between \u223c40\nand \u223c200 ks, every \u223c2 revolutions, as part of the \"Key Projects\"\nstrategy of INTEGRAL. The black-hole candidates within the\nfield of view are monitored by our team (PI Prat, see Prat et al.\n2008a), by taking advantage of the long exposure time to achieve\nearly detections of new outbursts and monitor their evolution. The XMM/Newton observation originate in a private programme (PI Wilms, Hanke et al. 2008), while the data from\nRXTE and Swift are public. The times of all observations are\nindicated on Fig. 1.\nThe INTEGRAL data were reduced using the standard Off-line Scientific Analysis (OSA) v7.0 software\npackage (Goldwurm et al. 2003). We used standard response\nfiles to obtain spectra of the source in the 18-200 keV range, with\n11 spectral bins (see Fig. 2 for a sample spectrum). A systematic\nerror of 2% was applied to all bins. The activation of H1743\u2212322\nwas monitored for \u223c170 ks without interruption by INTEGRAL,\nand we therefore took special care in analysing the very first data\navailable. Since H1743\u2212322 was too faint to be detected in single science window pointings, we used a \"sliding\" technique: we\naccumulated images of \u223c30 ks exposure time, every \u223c6 ks. This\nenables a more detailed study of its evolution, especially when\nconsidering the 20\u2013200 keV flux (Fig. 3, panel a). In the 3\u201320\nkeV range, JEM-X data were included in our analysis only after\nMJD 54749, when the source was sufficiently bright for spectral\nextraction to be possible in the data.\nThe RXTE and Swift /XRT data were reduced with the\nHEASOFT v6.5 software package following the standard steps explained in the RXTE cookbook1 and XRT users manual2. High\ntime resolution light curves were extracted from the PCA (all\n1\n2\n\n0\n\u22122\n\nASM (count s-1)\n\n\u03c7\n\n2\n\nnormalized counts/sec/keV\n\n10\n\n2\n\navailable at http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xte/data analysis.html\nhttp://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/swift/analysis/\n\n100\n\nFig. 2.

We restricted the energy range to \u223c3\u201340 keV (Channels 5\u201391). We\nproduced power-density spectra (PDS) with powspec v1.0 in\nthe frequency range 0.0156\u20131024 Hz. The PCA spectra were\nextracted in the \u223c3\u201325 keV range from the top layer of PCU\n2, from STANDARD 2 data, while background spectra were\nestimated from the PCA background model for bright sources.\nSystematic errors at a level of 0.8% were added to all channels.\nThe HEXTE spectra were extracted from Cluster B only.\nFor XRT data, we produced level 2 data with the\nxrtpipeline v0.12.0, which removed calibration source, bad\npixels and grade selection. We analyse only observations completed in photon-counting mode. We extracted images, light\ncurves, and spectra from these cleaned event files with xselect\nv2.4. However, even during the first observation the source was\nbright and its light was lightly to cause saturation; we therefore\nextracted source and background spectra from annuli centred on\nthe most accurately determined position of H1743\u2212322. We generated exposure maps with xrtexpomap v0.2.5, and ancillary response files with the tool xrtmkarf v0.5.6. The resultant spectra were rebinned so as to have at least 20 counts per channel,\nallowing the chi-squared statistics to be evaluated using xspec\nv11.3.2ag. The spectra were fitted between 0.5 keV and \u223c10 keV.\nThe XMM/Newton data were reduced with the Science\nAnalysis Software, xmmsas, v. 7.1, following standard procedures. We used successively the tasks epchain, rgsproc,\nevselect, rmfgen, and arfgen to produce spectra and response matrices. We restricted the data from the EPIC-pn (timing mode) to the 1\u201310 keV range. The first and second order\nspectra from RGS 1 and 2 were rebinned to contain \u2265 50 counts\nper bin.\n\n3. Results\n3.1. Spectral analysis and results\n\nApart from the first stages of the outburst, when the flux increased quickly, the source did not evolve significantly during\nany single day. Therefore, we combined the data from the various satellites when the observations were separated by less than\n\n\fL. Prat et al.: An early-phase hard state outburst of H1743\u2212322\n\n3\n\nFe K emission line. As a cut-off power law is usually interpreted as a signature of thermal Comptonization, we replaced\nthis simpler model with a more physical Comptonization model\n(COMPTT, Titarchuk 1994), and obtained equally good fits. The\nplasma temperatures that we obtained are similar to those corresponding to the cutoff energies measured using the phenomenological model, with slightly smaller error bars. Hereafter, the\nphoton indices were thus deduced from the phenomenological\nmodel, while the other spectral parameters were calculated using\nthe more physical constant*wabs*(comptt+diskbb+gaussian)\nmodel (in XSPEC terminology). The absorption is not well constrained by the RXTE /PCA observations and, when leaving this\nparameter free, we were unable to determine the temperature\nof the disc. Therefore, we assumed the value calculated using\nthe Swift and XMM/Newton observations, NH = 1.8 \u00b1 0.2 \u00d7\n1022 cm\u22122 , and fixed the NH parameter to this value in every observation.\nThe spectral evolution of H1743\u2212322 is reported in Fig. 3\n(panels a to e). The sizes of the error bars depend on the availability of the various satellites.\nDuring the first days of the outburst, around MJD 57433,\nthe source exhibited a rapid rise in hard X-ray flux: the flux increased by a factor \u223c2.3 in less than 1.5 days (Fig. 3, panel a).\nAt the same time, the photon index remained remarkably stable,\naround 1.65 (panel c). Then, between MJD 54741.5 and MJD\n54760, the 20\u2013200 keV flux reached a maximum and slowly\ndecayed, while the photon index stayed at low values, in the\nrange 1.2\u20131.6. The times when RXTE or Swift satellites are\navailable correspond to indices lower by \u223c0.3 compared with\nthe INTEGRAL data alone. This is due to the fact that the two\nformer satellites provide coverage in softer energy bands: since\nthe coverage of ISGRI starts around 18 keV, it cannot accurately\nconstrain the high-energy cutoff around \u223c20 keV. Instead, the\npresence of this cutoff appears to cause the photon index to be\nsofter, because the fitting process tends to mix the beginning of\nthe high energy rollover with the end of the pure power-law part.\nThe Comptonized component can be characterised by\nthe Kompaneets parameter (Rybicki & Lightman 1986), y =\n4kT e\nmax(\u03c4, \u03c42 ), where kT e is the plasma temperature, and \u03c4 its\nme c 2\noptical depth (panel d). This parameter did not evolve significantly before MJD 54759, and then decreased significantly\nwithin two days. At the same time, the 20\u2013200 keV flux decreased by \u223c45%, and a softening of the spectra occurred.\n3.2. Timing\n\nFig. 3. Spectral and timing characteristics of H1743\u2212322.

They show a flat top\ncomponent until a break frequency, above which the decrease\nin power versus frequency is almost power law like. This is also\nsimilar to the PDS of GRS 1915+105 during the so-called \u03c7 class\nof variability (Rodriguez et al. 2008). We therefore modelled the\nPDS of H1743\u2212322 using the same kind of model: one or two\nzero-centred Lorentzians, plus narrower ones to account for the\npresence of QPOs. Due to limited quality of our data, above \u223c20\nHz the PDS are consistent with white noise. We therefore restricted the fits to the range 0.0156\u201320 Hz. In all PDS extracted\nbefore MJD 54760, a strong type C QPO with its harmonic is\nvisible, as reported by Yamaoka et al. (2008).

Discussion\nThe spectral and temporal parameters of H1743-322 from MJD\n54732 to 54759 indicated that the source was in a HS typical\nof a Black-Hole Binary (Prat et al. 2008a). This was further supported by the observation of radio emission with a flat or slightly\ninverted spectrum (Corbel et al. 2008). We note that the source\nwas observed to be in this state from the very beginning of the\noutburst. After MJD 54761, the sharp decline in the RMS variability and the sudden increase in the QPO frequency within the\ntiming domain, observed to occur simultaneously with a sudden\nincrease in photon index and decrease in hard X-ray flux, indicate that the source had changed its state. We identify the new\nstate as a HIMS (Belloni et al. 2008; Prat et al. 2008b).\nWhen comparing this behaviour with that of the beginning\nof the 2003 outburst, we can see that H1743\u2212322 emulated in\nan approximate way its past behaviour. H1743\u2212322 remained\nwithin a HS for \u223c12 days only, compared with \u223c28 days for\nthe current outburst. The total fluxes were comparable: it was\nthen in the range 2.5\u20133 \u00d7 10\u22129 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 in the 20\u2013100 keV\nband (McClintock et al. 2007), compared with 0.5\u20133.3 \u00d7 10\u22129\nerg cm\u22122 s\u22121 . The total RMS powers were in the same range, i.e.\n\u223c25% in 2003, compared with \u223c30%. The RMS power and photon index are also similar to those exhibited during the 2003 outburst decay, when the source re-entered the HS (Kalemci et al.\n2006). We detect two QPOs, of frequencies \u223c0.3 and \u223c1 Hz,\nand RMS amplitudes of \u223c5 and \u223c10% respectively. During the\nbeginning of the 2003 outburst, a QPO was detected around \u223c0.1\nHz, along with its first harmonic, of \u223c3\u201314% RMS amplitude.\nThe main differences reside in the photon indices, which\nwere lower during the 2008 outburst, and the duration of the\nHS, which was shorter during the 2003 outburst, although it is\nunclear whether these differences are related.\nThe evolution in the different parameters follows two distinct\npaths. The overall evolution is characterised by a slowly decreasing hard X-ray flux and a slowly increasing QPO frequency. At\nthe same time, more rapid changes occur: we detect a rapid increase in the flux at the onset of the outburst, and a rapid softening of the spectra precisely as a drastic increase in the QPO\nfrequency takes place at the state transition. These two distinct\n\nbehaviours are reminiscent of the interpretation of Smith et al.\n(2002), which involved two different media: one medium that\nevolves with a long viscous timescale (the accretion disc), and\none that evolves more rapidly (a corona and/or a jet). We can\nindeed interpret the slowly decreasing hard X-ray flux as being\na consequence of the disc evolution: the disc slowly moves in\nand, as it does, gradually cools the corona. The properties of the\nQPOs are also comparable to that seen for other BHs in outburst. In particular, the frequency increases with the photon index (Fig. 4, Vignarca et al. 2003). The fact that the energy spectra are dominated by the Comptonized component indicates that,\nalthough the disc properties probably determine the frequency,\nthe observed QPO power is probably generated in the corona.\nThe slow increase in the QPO frequency is of particular interest. If we consider a model of an instability propagating inside the disc, the increase in frequency can be interpreted as a\nmovement of the inner part of the disc. In such a model, the frequency is somehow related to the Keplerian rotation frequency,\nsuch if the inner part of the disc moves in, the rotation frequency\nincreases, and thus so does the QPO frequency. After the transition to the HIMS, when the QPO frequency increases dramatically, this would indicate that the disk had moved further inwards. Unfortunately, H1743\u2212322 was not bright enough to enable the inner radius of the accretion disc to be determined precisely using the multicolor disc blackbody model.\nWe had the rare privilege to observe a poorly studied early\nphase of a BH outburst. Our analysis shows that the outburst\nstarted in a hard state, initiated by a rapid increase in the flux\nwith a roughly constant spectral shape. The parameters of these\nearly phases could provide important constraint on the subsequent evolution of the outburst. For example, the quite hard\nspectra seen here could be linked to the length of the HS interval. In the future, more sensitive hard X-ray instruments, such\nas SIMBOL-X, should allow us to study even fainter and thus\nearlier phases.\nAcknowledgements.
