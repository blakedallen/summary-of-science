Introduction\nLet A be a Q-linear tensor category in which idempotents split equipped with a\nfunctor H to super vector spaces. The endomorphisms universally of trace zero of an\nobject are the endomorphisms whose compositions with any other endomorphisms\nhave all trace zero. In the case A is a category of motives, the endomorphisms N (A)\nuniversally of trace zero of an object A are a subset of the numerically trivial ones.\nAccording to a result by Kimura in [17], if an object A is finite-dimensional, then\nevery numerically trivial endomorphism of A is nilpotent. A still open question is\nwhether the same result holds for Schur-finite objects (see [8]).\nFiniteness conditions for motives are related to part of the standard conjectures:\nin particular, if A is the category of Chow motives, then the finiteness of the motive\nof a surface with pg = 0 is equivalent to Bloch's Conjecture (see [12, Theorem 7]).\nIn this paper we show (Theorem 2.4) that if A has the sign property (Definition 2.3)\nand S\u03bb (A) = 0, where \u03bb is a partition which is not too big, i.e., it does not contain\nthe rectangle with a+ 2 rows and b + 2 columns, a and b being the dimensions of the\neven and the odd part of H(A), then every endomorphism in N (A) is nilpotent.\nWe start by recalling the definitions for the different finiteness notions and their\nmain properties. We then recall the the nilpotency conjecture and how this relates\nto the various finiteness notions. Then the main result is stated and proved (modulo\na combinatorial result) and we dedicate the rest of the section to analyzing some\nrelated facts and reasons why this might be the sharpest result possible using this\nparticular line of proof. The second and last section of the paper will prove the\nnecessary combinatorial facts which are used in the proof of the main result.\nWe keep the notation and the terminology of [8], except that we will write Tr for\nthe categorical trace in the sense of [15], tr for the ordinary trace of matrices, and\nDate: October 2nd, 2007.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nALESSIO DEL PADRONE AND CARLO MAZZA\n\nwe will write V0 |V1 (d0 |d1 ) for (the dimension of) the super vector space having the\ndi -dimensional vector space Vi in degree i.\nSince neither of the authors is an expert in combinatorics, the third section will\nbe less concise and we now recall some basic facts and notations: a partition \u03bb of n\nis a sequence\nof integers (\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbr ) such that \u03bbi \u2265 \u03bbi+1 > 0 for all i = 1, . . . , r \u2212 1\nP\nand i \u03bbi = n. We will often confuse a partition with its associated Young diagram\nand, e.g., we say that the partition (ba ) is the rectangle with a rows and b columns.\nIf \u03bb is a partition, we write \u03bb\u2032 = (\u03bb\u20321 , . . . , \u03bb\u2032s ) for the transposed partition. We say\nthat (i, j) \u2208 \u03bb if \u03bbi \u2265 j. The maximal hook of \u03bb is the hook (\u03bb1 , 1r\u22121 ); the maximal\nskew hook is the set {(i, j) \u2208 \u03bb s.t. (i + 1, j + 1) 6\u2208 \u03bb}. If \u03bd is the maximal (skew\nor not) hook, then \u03bb \\ \u03bd is the partition (\u03bb2 \u2212 1, . . . , \u03bbr \u2212 1). Let \u03bc = (\u03bc1 , . . . , \u03bcs )\nand \u03bb = (\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbr ) be two partitions, we say that \u03bc \u2286 \u03bb if s \u2264 r and \u03bci \u2264 \u03bbi for\nall i = 1, . . . , s.\n2. Finite-dimensionality and nilpotency\nLet A be a pseudo-abelian \u2297-category, i.e., a \"\u2297-cat\u00e9gorie rigide sur F \" as in\n[1, 2.2.2] in which idempotents split. We assume that F = EndA (1) and it contains\nQ. The partitions \u03bb of an integer n give a complete set of mutually orthogonal\ncentral idempotents\ndim V\u03bb X\n\u03c7\u03bb (\u03c3)\u03c3\nd\u03bb :=\nn!\n\u03c3\u2208\u03a3n\n\nin the group algebra Q\u03a3n (see [11]). We define an endofunctor on A by setting\nS\u03bb (A) = d\u03bb (A\u2297n ). This is a multiple of the classical Schur functor corresponding\nto \u03bb. In particular, we define Symn (A) = S(n) (A) and \u039bn (A) = S(1n ) (A). The\nfollowing definitions are directly inspired by [9] and [17] (see [3], [12], and [19] for\nfurther reference).\nDefinition 2.1. An object A of A is Schur-finite if there is a partition \u03bb such\nthat S\u03bb (A) = 0. If S\u03bb (A) = 0 with \u03bb of the form (n) (respectively, \u03bb = (1n )) then\nA is called odd (respectively, even). We say that A is finite-dimensional (in the\nsense of Kimura-O'Sullivan) if A = A+ \u2295 A\u2212 with A+ even and A\u2212 odd.\nBoth finite-dimensionality and Schur-finiteness are stable under direct sums,\ntensor products, duals, and taking direct summands. Hence every finite-dimensional\nobject is Schur-finite, but the converse does not hold (see [6, 2.6.5.1]). On the\nother hand, this weaker condition is compatible with triangulated structures on the\ncategory while finite-dimensionality is not (see [19, 3.6 and 3.8]).\nOne of the most important consequences of finite-dimensionality is the nilpotency\nof endomorphisms universally of trace zero.\n\nDefinition 2.2. Recall that we have F -linear trace maps Tr : EndA (A) \u2212\u2192 EndA (1)\ncompatible with \u2297-functors. We define the F -submodules of endomorphisms\nuniversally of trace zero as\nN (A) := {f \u2208 HomA (A, A) | Tr(f \u25e6 g) = 0, for all g \u2208 HomA (A, A)}.\nWe say an object A is a phantom if IdA \u2208 N (A).\nAndr\u00e9 and Kahn proved in [3, 9.1.14] that if A is a finite-dimensional object, then\nany f \u2208 N (A) is nilpotent. In particular, if all objects of A are finite-dimensional,\nthen the projection functor A \u2192 A/N lifts idempotents and is conservative (hence\n\n\fSCHUR-FINITENESS AND ENDOMORPHISMS UNIVERSALLY...\n\n3\n\n\"there are no phantom objects\"). In general \u2297-categories, Schur-finiteness is not\nsufficient to get the nilpotency of N (A); see [3, 10.1.1] for an example of a phantom\nnon-zero Schur-finite object, i.e., whose identity is universally of trace zero.\nIn the special case of Chow motives, if M (X) is the motive of a smooth variety X,\nthen N (M (X)) is the set of the numerically trivial correspondences CH dim X (X \u00d7\nX)num , and the Andr\u00e9-Kahn result generalizes a previous result by Kimura ([17,\n7.5]) who also conjectured in loc. cit. that all Chow motives are finite-dimensional,\nand hence all N (M (X)) are nilpotent. Moreover, the conjectures of Bloch-BeilinsonMurre (together with the \"numerical=homological\" standard conjecture) imply the\nnilpotency of all endomorphism algebras and this implies the finite-dimensionality\nof each object. In order to extend the Andr\u00e9-Kahn result to a larger subclass of\nSchur-finite objects, we needed to find a peculiar feature which forces the nilpotency and is expected to be true in the category of motives. We will show that the\nsign property is such a feature.\nFrom now on, let A be a category of homological type (see [16, 4]), i.e., a\ncategory with a \u2297-functor to super vector spaces H : A \u2192 sV ect which we will call\n\"cohomology\" by abuse of notation.\nDefinition 2.3. We say that an object A in a category of homological type has the\nsign property if the projections on the even and the odd part of the cohomology\nH(A) = H(A)0 \u2295 H(A)1 lift to endomorphisms in A (cf. [16, 4.8]).\nIn particular, the category of motives is of homological type and the sign property is known as the sign conjecture ([14, p. 426]) which is a part of the conjecture\non the algebraicity of the Chow-K\u00fcnneth decomposition of the diagonal. The main\ndifference is that we do not require the lifts to be idempotents or orthogonal, although they are so in cohomology.\nThe next theorem is our main result: its proof relies on a combinatorial result\nwhich will be proved in \u00a73. The rest of this section will be dedicated to some related\nremarks some of which suggest that this might the best generalization possible of\nthis line of proof.\nTheorem 2.4. Suppose A has the sign property and let H(A) be of dimension\nd0 |d1 . Let S\u03bb (A) = 0 for a partition \u03bb of n \u2265 2 such that (d1 + 2)(d0 +2) * \u03bb\nand let s be the length of the biggest hook in \u03bb. Then for any f \u2208 N (A) we have\nf \u25e6(s\u22121) = 0.\nProof. Let \u03bd be the maximal hook \u03bd of \u03bb, r := n \u2212 s and \u03b4 := \u03bb \\ \u03bd. A key role is\nplayed by the following function: for any f1 , . . . , fr \u2208 End(A), let\n(2.4.1) y(\u03b4; f1 , . . . , fr ) := Tr(d\u03b4 \u25e6 f1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 fr )\n=\n\nq\nY\ndim V\u03b4 X\nTr(f\u03b3j lj \u22121 (kj ) \u25e6 * * * \u25e6 f\u03b3j (kj ) \u25e6 fkj ),\n\u03c7\u03b4 (\u03c3)\n|\u03b4|!\nj=1\n\u03c3\u2208\u03a3r\n\nwhere \u03b31 \u25e6 * * * \u25e6 \u03b3q\u03c3 is the cycle decomposition of \u03c3, kj is any element in the support\nof \u03b3j , and lj is the length of the cycle \u03b3j . Our proof of [8, Theorem 2.1] shows that\nif y(\u03b4; \u2212, . . . , \u2212) is not the zero function on End(A)r , then f \u25e6(s\u22121) = 0 for each\nf \u2208 N (A).\nSince A has the sign property then there exist two endomorphisms \u03c00 and \u03c01\nsuch that ti := Tr(H(\u03c0i )) = (\u22121)i di (i = 0, 1), and we have the following trace\nidentities:\n\n\f4\n\nALESSIO DEL PADRONE AND CARLO MAZZA\n\n(TI1) ti = Tr(\u03c0i ) = Tr(\u03c0il ) \u2208 Z for all l > 0, and\n(TI2) Tr(\u03c0j1 \u25e6* * *\u25e6\u03c0jk ) = 0 for any k > 1 and any non-constant map j : {1, ..., k} \u2212\u2192\n{0, 1}.\nLet us choose f1 = * * * = fr = g := \u03b10 \u03c00 + \u03b11 \u03c01 , then it is an immediate\nconsequence of the properties (TI1) and (TI2) that y becomes a polynomial in\n\u03b10 , \u03b11 , t0 , t1\ny(\u03b4; g) := y(\u03b4; g, . . . , g) =\n\nq\nY\ndim V\u03b4 X\n(\u03b10 lj t0 + \u03b11 lj t1 )\n\u03c7\u03b4 (\u03c3)\n|\u03b4|!\nj=1\n\u03c3\u2208\u03a3|\u03b4|\n\nSince H is a tensor functor, S\u03bb (H(A)) = H(S\u03bb (A)). But S\u03bb (H(A)) = 0 if and\nonly if (d0 + 1, d1 + 1) \u2208 \u03bb (see [9, 1.9]) and therefore S\u03bb (A) = 0 implies that\n(d0 + 1, d1 + 1) \u2208 \u03bb, and, in particular, (d0 , d1 ) \u2208 \u03b4. But by hypothesis, we have\nthat (d0 + 2, d1 + 2) 6\u2208 \u03bb and then (d0 + 1, d1 + 1) 6\u2208 \u03b4. So (d0 , d1 ) is in the maximal\nskew hook of \u03b4.\nFrom the results in \u00a73, it follows that y(\u03b4; g) is the polynomial P (\u03b4; \u03b10 , \u03b11 ; t0 , t1 )\nin Q[\u03b10 , \u03b11 , t0 , t1 ] which, when computed for t0 = d0 and t1 = \u2212d1 , is a non-zero\npolynomial in \u03b10 and \u03b11 . Since the coefficients of this polynomial are a field of\ncharacteristic zero, this proves the theorem.\n\u0003\nRemark 2.5. Proving that the function y(\u03bb \\ \u03bd; \u2212, . . . , \u2212) (defined in equation\n2.4.1) is not zero is a combinatorial problem because it does not depend on the\nchoice of the category. In particular, it can be calculated on a super-vector space.\nRemark 2.6. If S\u03bb (A) = 0 and its cohomology is of super dimension d0 |d1 , then\n\u03bb \u2287 ((d1 + 1)d0 +1 ), and there exist f1 , . . . , fr such that y(\u03bb \\ \u03bd; f1 , . . . , fr ) 6= 0 only\nif \u03bb + ((d1 + 2)d0 +2 ).\nThe first assertion is in the proof of 2.4, while the second one follows from the\nuniversal relations among super traces characterized by Razmyslov. A suitable\nformulation of his result is in Berele's [4, 3.1] where it is shown that if (d0 + 2, d1 +\n2) \u2208 \u03bb, and so (d0 + 1, d1 + 1) \u2208 \u03b4 := \u03bb \\ \u03bd, then d\u03b4 \u2208 Q\u03a3|\u03b4| belongs to the\ntwo sided ideal of Q\u03a3|\u03b4| of those elements whose associated \"trace polynomial\"\n(in our notation, just a multiple of y(\u03b4; \u2212, . . . , \u2212) by a non-zero constant) is an\nidentity of super matrices with even dimension d0 and odd dimension d1 . That is,\nif \u03bb \u2287 ((d1 + 2)d0 +2 ), then y(\u03bb \\ \u03bd; f1 , . . . , fr ) = 0 for any choice of f1 , . . . , fr . For\nmore details, see the given reference, or [7], or [6, 2.5].\nRemark 2.7. Note that in categories of homological type, and in particular for\nmotives, there is really nothing lost in considering only EndA (A)r instead of trying\nto exploit EndA (A\u2297r ), for End(H(A\u2297r )) \u223c\n= End(H(A))\u2297r as vector spaces.\nRemark 2.8. (P. Deligne) By 2.5, it suffices to do the calculations on a super\nvector space V . Letting \u03c00 and \u03c01 be the projections, \u03c00 \u2212 \u03c01 is (\u22121)i in degree i\nand so\nTr(d\u03b4 \u25e6 (\u03c00 \u2212 \u03c01 )\u2297r ) = dim(Im(d\u03b4 )+ ) + dim(Im(d\u03b4 )\u2212 )\nwhich is non-zero if and only if S\u03b4 (V ) 6= 0. This is a sufficient condition for the\nnon-vanishing of y(\u03b4; \u03c00 \u2212 \u03c01 ).\nRemark 2.9. By 2.4, we have that f \u25e6(s\u22121) = 0 for all f \u2208 N (A). Using Razmislov's\nimprovement of the (Dubnov-Ivanov) Nagata-Higman Theorem (see [10] and [20,\n2\n11.8.10]) we have that N (A)(s\u22121) = 0. Thus for finite-dimensional objects A =\n\n\fSCHUR-FINITENESS AND ENDOMORPHISMS UNIVERSALLY...\n\n5\n\nA+ \u2295 A\u2212 the known nilpotency bounds ([2, 3.4]) can be improved: indeed such\nan object is (minimally) killed by the rectangle \u03bb = ((kim(A\u2212 ) + 1)kim(A+ )+1 ),\nhence s \u2212 1 = kim(A) ([6, 2.4.10] or [7]). In the setting of categories of homological\ntype a different bound is given in [16, 4.10 b)] (see also [16, 4.11]). However, for\nany (twist of direct summand of a) pure motive h(X), the global nilpotency bound\nfor N (h(X)) should be dim(X) + 1 by Bloch-Beilinson-Murre's conjectures ([13,\nConjecture 2.1 (strong e)]). As a partial evidence, Morihiko Saito proved in [21]\nthat for smooth complex surfaces S with pg = 0, Bloch's conjecture ([13, Conjecture\n1.8]) is equivalent to (CH 2 (S \u00d7 S)hom )3 = 0.\n\n3. The combinatorial result\nWe now state and prove the main combinatorial result. As a corollary, we will\nget the non-vanishing we needed. We are interested in studying the following polynomial.\nDefinition 3.1. Let \u03b4 be a partition of r, we define:\n\nP (\u03b4; \u03b10 , \u03b11 ; t0 , t1 ) :=\n\nq\nY\ndim V\u03b4 X\n(\u03b10 lj t0 + \u03b11 lj t1 )\n\u03c7\u03b4 (\u03c3)\nr!\nj=1\n\u03c3\u2208\u03a3r\n\nas a polynomial in Q[\u03b10 , \u03b11 , t0 , t1 ], where the lj are the lengths of the cycles in the\ncycle decomposition of \u03c3.\nNotice that P (\u03b4; 1, 0; t0 , t1 ) is the content polynomial of \u03b4 as an element of Q[t0 ].\nProposition 3.2. Let \u03b4 be any partition, and let P (\u03b4; \u03b10 , \u03b11 ; t0 , t1 ) be the polynomial defined in 3.1. Then for any (d0 , d1 ) in the maximal skew hook of \u03b4 we have\nthe following identity of polynomials in \u03b10 and \u03b11 :\nP (\u03b4; \u03b10 , \u03b11 ; d0 , \u2212d1 )\n= (dim V\u03b4 )(\u22121)|\u03bd|\n\ndim V\u03bc dim V\u03bd\n(\u03b10 \u2212 \u03b11 )d0 d1 \u03b10 |\u03bc| \u03b11 |\u03bd| cp\u03bc (d0 )cp\u03bd (d1 ),\n|\u03bc|!\n|\u03bd|!\n\nwhere \u03bc is the partition whose non-zero parts are the positive \u03b4i \u2212 d1 , and \u03bd is the\npartition whose non-zero parts are the positive \u03b4i\u2032 \u2212 d0 (see [5, 6.14]).\nProof. Let A be the Q-linear category of super vector spaces and let A be Qd0 |Qd1 .\nBy Remark 2.5, we can describe the polynomial P (\u03b4; \u03b10 , \u03b11 ; d0 , \u2212d1 ) in terms of\nthe (super) trace of g \u2208 EndA (A) given by \u03b10 \u03c00 + \u03b11 \u03c01 , where \u03c0i \u2208 EndA (A)\nis the projection on the degree i part (if \u03b10 \u03b11 6= 0 then g \u2208 GL(d0 |d1 )). More\nprecisely, if e\u03b4 is any (idempotent) Young symmetrizer associated to \u03b4, then P =\n1\ne := \u03b10 \u03c00 \u2212 \u03b11 \u03c01 of the character \u03c7\u03b4\ndim V\u03b4 P (\u03b4; \u03b10 , \u03b11 ; d0 , \u2212d1 ) is the evaluation on g\nA \u2297|\u03b4|\nof the representation e\u03b4 A\nof GL(d0 |d1 ). Indeed, letting s\u03b8 be the usual Schur\n\n\f6\n\nALESSIO DEL PADRONE AND CARLO MAZZA\n\nfunction of a partition \u03b8 we have:\nP (\u03b4; \u03b10 , \u03b11 ; d0 , \u2212d1 )\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n(a)\n\n=\n\n1\nTr(d\u03b4 \u25e6 g \u2297|\u03b4| )\ndim V\u03b4\nTr(e\u03b4 \u25e6 g \u2297|\u03b4| )\ntr(e\u03b4 \u25e6 ge\u2297|\u03b4| )\n\ntr(e\u03b4 \u25e6 (\u03b10 \u03c00 \u2212 \u03b11 \u03c01 )\u2297|\u03b4| )\n\nHS\u03b4 (\u03b10 , . . . , \u03b10 , \u2212\u03b11 , * * * , \u2212\u03b11 )\n| {z } |\n{z\n}\nd0\n\n(b)\n\n=\n\nd0 Y\nd1\nY\n1\n\n=\n\n1\n\n|\u03bd|\n\n!\n\nd1\n\n(\u03b10 \u2212 \u03b11 ) s\u03bc (\u03b10 , . . . , \u03b10 )s\u03bd (\u2212\u03b11 , . . . , \u2212\u03b11 )\n| {z }\n|\n{z\n}\nd0 d1\n\n(\u22121) (\u03b10 \u2212 \u03b11 )\n\nd0\n\n\u03b10\n\n|\u03bc|\n\n\u03b11\n\n|\u03bd|\n\nd1\n\ns\u03bc (1, . . . , 1)s\u03bd (1, . . . , 1),\n| {z }\n| {z }\nd0\n\n(c)\n\n=\n\n(\u22121)|\u03bd|\n\nd1\n\ndim V\u03bc dim V\u03bd\n(\u03b10 \u2212 \u03b11 )d0 d1 \u03b10 |\u03bc| \u03b11 |\u03bd| cp\u03bc (d0 )cp\u03bd (d1 ),\n|\u03bc|!\n|\u03bd|!\n\nwhere \u03bc is the partition whose non-zero parts are the positive \u03b4i \u2212 d1 , and \u03bd is the\npartition whose non-zero parts are the positive \u03b4i\u2032 \u2212 d0 (see [5, 6.14]).\nThe hyphotesis (d0 + 1, d1 + 1) 6\u2208 \u03b4 allows us to exploit [5, 6.10 (b)] in (a), and\n[5, 6.20] in (b). Notice that the \u03a3|\u03b4| action defined in [5, 1] coincides with the\none induced by the (Koszul) commutativity constraint of A. The equality (c) is a\nwell-known fact (see [18, I.3, Example 5 and the proof of I.7(7.6)]).\n\u0003\nCorollary 3.3. Let P be the polynomial defined in 3.1. If (d0 , d1 ) is in the maximal\nskew hook of \u03b4, then P (\u03b4; \u03b10 , \u03b11 ; d0 , \u2212d1 ) is a non-zero polynomial in \u03b10 and \u03b11 .\nProof. By Theorem 3.2, we just need to show that cp\u03bc (d0 ) 6= 0 and cp\u03bd (d1 ) 6= 0.\nLet us show the first one, since the second one comes from passing to the transpose\npartition. If (d0 , d1 ) is in the maximal skew hook of \u03b4, then \u03b4d0 +1 \u2264 d1 , so \u03bc has\nat most d0 rows which in turn implies that cp\u03bc (d0 ) 6= 0.\n\u0003\nShortly after the proof of the Theorem 3.2 was completed, Christine Bessenrodt\ninformed us that Richard Stanley had suggested a slightly different solution: it\nfollows from the theory of super Schur functions, for our polynomial P can be\nobtained from the power-sum expansion of the Schur function s\u03b4 by a suitable\nsubstitution. Then, one can apply Problem 50(g) in the Supplementary Problems\nfor Chapter 7 of Stanley's book Enumerative Combinatorics II (on his EC web\npage), which is based on [5]. We decided to maintain our approach for it is closer\nto our original \"motivic\" point of view.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Christine Bessenrodt for her suggestions and interest in the problem,\nand Bruno Kahn for supplying the most recent version of his work.
