Woodard\na\n\na\u2217\n\nDepartment of Physics, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611, United States\n\nQuantum gravitational back-reaction offers a simultaneous explanation for why the cosmological constant is\nso small and a natural model of inflation in which scalars play no role. In this talk I review previous work and\npresent a simple model of the mechanism in which the induced stress tensor behaves like negative vacuum energy\nwith a density proportional to \u2212\u039b/8\u03c0G * (G\u039b)2 * Ht. The model also highlights the essential role of causality in\nback-reaction.\n\nThe application of a force field in quantum field\ntheory generally rearranges virtual quanta and\nthereby induces currents and/or stresses which\nmodify the original force field. This is the phenomenon of back-reaction. Famous examples include the response of QED to a homogeneous electric field [1] and the response of generic matter\ntheories to the gravitational field of a black hole\n[2]. In the former case, virtual e+ e\u2212 pairs can\nacquire the energy needed to become real by tunnelling up and down the field lines. The newly\ncreated pairs are also accelerated in the electric\nfield, which gives a current that reduces the original electric field. The event horizon of a black\nhole also causes particle creation when one member of a virtual pair passes out of causal contact\nwith the other by entering the event horizon. As\nthe resultant Hawking radiation carries away the\nblack hole's mass the surface gravity rises.\nParker [3] was the first to realize that the expansion of spacetime can lead to the production of\nmassless, minimally coupled scalars. Grishchuk\n[4] later showed that the same mechanism applies\nto gravitons. Production of these particles is especially efficient during inflation because of the\ncausal horizon. Consider a spatially flat, locally\nde Sitter geometry with Hubble constant H, the\ninvariant element for which is,\nds2 = \u2212dt2 + e2Ht d~x * d~x .\n\n(1)\n\nWhereas the co-moving time t corresponds to the\n\u2217 Supported\n\nby DOE contact DE-FG02-97ER-41029 and\nby the Institute for Fundamental Theory.\n\nduration of physical processes, the physical distance between two points ~x and ~y is not their\ncoordinate separation, \u2206l \u2261 k~x \u2212 ~yk, but rather\neHt \u2206l. This is a geometry in which Zeno's paradox about the impossibility of motion can come\ntrue! For if a photon is emitted at time t = 0\nfrom an observer more distant than one Hubble\nlength, H \u22121 , then the observer will never see it.\nBy the time the photon has covered half the initial distance, the spacetime in between will have\nexpanded by so much that the photon actually\nhas further to go.\nNow add the Uncertainty Principle. Even in\nflat space this requires virtual particles to be continually emerging from the vacuum and then disappearing back into it. But massless particles\nwhich are not also conformally invariant have a\nreasonable amplitude for appearing with wavelength greater than H \u22121 . When this happens in\nan inflating universe the particles must be ripped\napart from one another by the Hubble flow. Since\nthis creation mechanism requires both effective\nmasslessness on the scale of inflation and the absence of conformal invariance, it is limited to\ngravitons and to light, minimally coupled scalars.\nThere is no doubt as to the reality of inflationary particle production because it is the usual\nexplanation [5,6] for the primordial spectrum of\ncosmological density perturbations whose imprint\non the cosmic microwave background has been so\nclearly imaged by the latest balloon experiments\n[7,8]. Our special interest is the back-reaction\n\n\f2\nfrom this process. There is no buildup of particle density because the 3-volume expands as new\nparticles are created so as to keep the density constant. When a new pair is pulled out of the vacuum the one before it is, on average, already in\nanother Hubble volume. However, the gravitational field is another thing. The created particles are highly infrared so they do not carry much\nstress-energy, but they do carry some, and this\nmust engender a gravitational field in the region\nbetween them. Because gravity is attractive this\nfield acts to resist the Hubble flow. Further, it is\ncumulative. The gravitational field of a created\npair must remain behind to add with that of subsequent pairs, just as an observer continues to feel\nthe gravity of a pebble even after dropping it into\na black hole.\nWe believe that the gravitational attraction between virtual infrared gravitons gradually builds\nup a restoring force that impedes further inflation [9]. Gravity is a weak interaction, even at\nthe enormous energies usually conceived for inflation, so the increment from each new pair is\nminuscule. But the effect must continue to grow\nuntil it becomes non-perturbatively strong, unless\nsomething else supervene to end inflation first.\nThis mechanism offers the dazzling prospect of\nsimultaneously resolving the (old) problem of the\ncosmological constant [10] and providing a natural model of inflation in which there is no scalar\ninflaton. The idea is that the actual cosmological\nconstant is not small and that this is what caused\ninflation during the early universe. Back-reaction\nplays the crucial role of ending inflation.\nA sometimes confusing point is that one does\nnot require the complete theory of quantum gravity in order to study an infrared process such\nas this. As long as spurious time dependence\nis not injected through the ultraviolet regularization, the late time back-reaction is dominated\nby ultraviolet finite, nonlocal terms whose form\nis entirely controlled by the low energy limiting\ntheory. This theory must be general relativity,\nL=\n\n\u221a\n1\n(R \u2212 2\u039b) \u2212g ,\n16\u03c0G\n\n(2)\n\nwith the possible addition of some light scalars.\nHere \"light\" means massless with respect to H \u2261\n\np\n\u039b/3. No other quanta can contribute effectively\nin this regime.\nIt is worth commenting that infrared phenomena can always be studied using the low energy\neffective theory. This is why Bloch and Nordsieck\n[11] were able to resolve the infrared problem of\nQED before the theory's renormalizability was\nsuspected. It is also why Weinberg [12] was able\nto achieve a similar resolution for \u039b = 0 quantum general relativity. And it is why Feinberg\nand Sucher [13] were able to compute the long\nrange force due to neutrino exchange using Fermi\ntheory. More recently Donoghue [14] has been\nworking along the same lines for \u039b = 0 quantum\ngravity.\nTo see a crude, Newtonian version of the process, consider locally de Sitter inflation on the\nmanifold T 3 \u00d7 R, so that the physical radius of\nthe universe at co-moving time t is,\nr(t) \u223c H \u22121 eHt .\n\n(3)\n\nThe bare energy density of inflationally produced\ninfrared gravitons - just the h\u0304\u03c9 per graviton -\nis [4],\n\u03c1IR \u223c H 4 .\n\n(4)\n\nThis is insignificant compared with the energy\ndensity of the cosmological constant, \u039b/8\u03c0G, and\n\u03c1IR is in any case positive. However, the gravitational interaction energy is negative, and it\ncan be enormous if there is contact between a\nlarge enough fraction of the total mass of infrared\ngravitons,\nM (t) \u223c r3 (t)\u03c1IR \u223c He3Ht .\n\n(5)\n\nFor example, if M (t) was all in contact with itself\nthe Newtonian interaction energy would be,\n\u2212\n\nGM 2 (t)\n\u223c \u2212GH 3 e5Ht ,\nr(t)\n\n(6)\n\nDividing by the 3-volume gives a density of about\n\u2212GH 6 e2Ht , which rapidly becomes enormous.\nOf course this ignores causality. Most of the infrared gravitons needed to maintain \u03c1IR are produced out of causal contact with one another in\ndifferent Hubble volumes. The ones in gravitational interaction are those produced within the\n\n\f3\nsame Hubble volume. Since the number of Hubble volumes grows like e3Ht , the rate at which\nmass is produced within a single Hubble volume\nis,\ndM1\n\u223c H2 .\ndt\n\n(7)\n\nAlthough most of the newly produced gravitons\nsoon leave the Hubble volume, their gravitational\npotentials must remain, just as an outside observer continues to feel the gravity of particles\nthat fall into a black hole. The rate at which the\nNewtonian potential accumulates is therefore,\nG dM1\nd\u03a61\n\u223c \u2212 \u22121\n\u223c \u2212GH 3 .\ndt\nH\ndt\n\n(8)\n\nHence the Newtonian gravitational interaction\nenergy density is,\n\u03c1(t) \u223c\n\u223c\n\n\u03c1IR \u03a61 (t) \u223c \u2212GH 6 Ht\n\u039b\n* (G\u039b)2 * Ht .\n\u2212\n8\u03c0G\n\n(9)\n(10)\n\nWhen the number of e-foldings Ht becomes\nlarge, the fractional rate of change of the gravitational interaction energy is negligible compared\nwith the expansion rate,\n|\u03c1\u0307(t)| \u226a H|\u03c1(t)| .\n\n(11)\n\nIt follows from energy conservation,\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u03c1\u0307(t) = \u22123H \u03c1(t) + p(t) ,\n\n(12)\n\nthat the induced pressure must be nearly opposite to the energy density. In other words, backreaction induces negative vacuum energy.\nIf inflation persists long enough, the minuscule\ndimensionless coupling constant in (10) - (G\u039b)2\n- can be overcome by the secular growth in the\nnumber of e-foldings, Ht. Of course nonlinear effects become important as well. The physical picture is of inflation ending, rather suddenly, with\nthe universe poised on the verge of gravitational\ncollapse.\nDetailed, explicit computations confirm the\nqualitative analysis presented above, at two loops\nfor pure gravity [15] and at three loops for a\nmassless, minimally coupled \u03c64 theory in which\nthe scalar self-interaction provides the breaking\n\nmechanism [16]. We worked on the manifold\nT 3 \u00d7 R and used the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism [17] to compute the expectation value of the\nmetric in the presence of a state which is free,\nBunch-Davies vacuum at t = 0. Since the state is\nhomogeneous and isotropic the expectation value\nof the metric can be put in the form,\nh\u03a9|g\u03bc\u03bd (t, ~x)dx\u03bc dx\u03bd |\u03a9i = \u2212dt2 + e2b(t) d~x * d~x .(13)\nWe used perturbation theory about the background b0 (t) = Ht. There is no secular slowing\nat one loop because the inflationary production of\ngravitons is itself a one loop effect and the backreaction from it must come at a higher order in\nperturbation theory. Including two loop effects\ngives the following result for the expansion rate,\n(\n\u00132 \u0014\n\u0012\n1\nG\u039b\n(Ht)2\n\u1e03(t) = H 1 \u2212\n3\u03c0\n6\ni\no\n+ O(Ht) + O(G3 ) .\n(14)\n\nThe extra factor of Ht not present in our Newtonian model derives from general relativistic effects\nhaving to do with the response to pressure in a\nlocally de Sitter background.\nAlthough we did not compute contributions at\nthree loops and higher we were able to obtain all\norders bounds on their time dependence. These\nbounds show that the two loop result dominates\nfor as long as perturbation theory remains valid\n[18]. Of course one cannot trust this analysis\nwhen the effect becomes of order one. The correct\nstatement is that back-reaction slows inflation by\nan amount that eventually becomes nonperturbatively large. We have some ideas [19] about how\nto evolve beyond this point but no firm results as\nyet.\nIt is highly significant that this model of inflation contains only a single free parameter, the\ndimensionless product of Newton's constant and\nthe cosmological constant, G\u039b. This means that\nthe model makes unique and testable predictions\nin a way that generic scalar-driven inflation can\nnever do. In fact the model's predictions for the\nCMBR parameters AS , r, nS and nT have recently been worked out [20]. The scalar amplitude AS sets G\u039b, but the other three are legiti-\n\n\f4\nmate predictions of the model. They are in agreement with the latest data and will be subject to\nmuch closer experimental scrutiny from the precision satellite probes which are due to be flown\nin the coming decade. These may be the first observations of quantum gravitational phenomena!\nREFERENCES\n1. J. Schwinger, Phys. Rev. 89 (1951) 664.\n2. S. W. Hawking, Nature 248 (1974) 30; Commun. Math.
