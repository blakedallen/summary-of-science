ROSENTHAL*\nAbstract. Several new characterizations of Banach spaces containing a subspace isomorphic to l1 ,\nare obtained. These are applied to the question of when l1 embeds in the injective tensor product of\ntwo Banach spaces.\n\nNotations and terminology. All Banach spaces are taken as infinite dimensional, \"subspace\" means\n\"closed linear subspace,\" \"operator\" means \"bounded linear operator.\" If W is a subset of a Banach\nspace, [W ] denotes its closed linear span. c denotes the cardinal of the continuum, i.e., c = 2\u05d00 ; this\nis also identified with the least ordinal of cardinality c.\n\u221e, lpc denotes the family f of\nP For 1 \u2264 pp <\n1/p\n< \u221e. Finally, we recall that\nall scalar valued functions defined on c with kf kp = ( \u03b1<c |f (\u03b1)| )\na scalar-valued function defined on a compact metric space K is called universally measurable if it is\nmeasurable with respect to the completion of every Borel measure on K.\nThroughout this paper, the symbols X, Y, Z, B, E shall denote Banach spaces. Ba X denotes the\nclosed unit ball of X. Recall that an operator T : X \u2192 Y is called Dunford-Pettis if T maps weakly\ncompact sets in X to norm compact sets in Y . Also, L(X, Y ) (resp. K(X, Y )) denotes the space of\noperators (resp. of compact operators) from X to Y , L(X) = L(X, X), K(X) = K(X, X). A bounded\nsubset W of X \u2217 is said to isomorphically norm X if there exists a C < \u221e such that\nkxk \u2264 C sup |w(x)| for all x \u2208 X .\nw\u2208W\n\u2228\n\n\u2227\n\nIn case C = 1 and W \u2282 Ba X \u2217 , we say that W isometrically norms X. X \u2297 Y , X \u2297 Y denote the\ninjective, respectively projective, tensor products of X and Y . See [DU], [Gr2] for terminology and\ntheorems in this area.\nMain results. Our first main result gives several equivalences for a Banach space to contain an isomorph of l1 . We have included many previously known ones, to round out the list; also, we use some\nof them later on. As far as I know, the equivalences of 1. with the following are new: 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8,\n11, 12, 13, 14, 19. (Of course some of the implications were previously known or are obvious. Also, the\nsame construction proves that 2, 3, 4 and 6 imply 1, but I thought it useful nevertheless to list these\nexplicitly.) For other equivalences, cf. [H1], [Hay], [G1], Theorem II.3 of [G2], [Ro4], and several of the\nremarks following the proof of Theorem 1.\nTheorem 1. Let X be given. Then the following are equivalent.\n1. l1 is not isomorphic to a subspace of X.\n2. Every integral operator from Y to X \u2217 is compact, for any Y .\n3. Every integral operator from l1 to X \u2217 is compact.\n4. Every integral operator on X \u2217 is compact.\n5. Every integral operator from X to Y is compact, for any Y .\n6. Every integral operator from X to X \u2217 is compact.\n7. Every operator from L1 to X \u2217 is Dunford-Pettis.\n8. Every Dunford Pettis operator from X to Y is compact, for arbitrary Y .\n9. Every w\u2217 -compact subset of X \u2217 is the norm-closed convex hull of its extreme points.\n10. If K is a weak\u2217 -compact subset of X \u2217 which isomorphically norms X, then [K] = X \u2217 .\n*Research partially supported by NSF DMS-0700126.\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nHASKELL P. ROSENTHAL\n\nThe remaining equivalences assume that X is separable.\nEvery unconditional family in X \u2217 is countable.\nEvery unconditional family in X \u2217 has cardinality less than c.\nL(X \u2217 , l\u221e ) has cardinality c.\nL(X \u2217 ) has cardinality c.\nX \u2217\u2217 has cardinality c.\nX \u2217\u2217 has cardinality less than 2c .\nIf K is a weak\u2217 -compact subset of X \u2217 and (xn ) is a bounded sequence in X, then setting\nx\u0302n (k) = k(xn ) for all k and n, any point-wise cluster point of (x\u0302n ) belongs to the first Baire\nclass on K.\n18. There exists an isomorphically norming w\u2217 -compact subset K of X \u2217 so that if (xn ) is as in 17,\nthen (x\u0302n ) has a point-wise cluster point which is universally measurable on K.\n19. There exists a K as in 18 so that if (xn ) is as in 17, the cardinality of the set of point-wise\ncluster points of (x\u0302n ) on K, is less than 2c .\n11.\n12.\n13.\n14.\n15.\n16.\n17.\n\nThe implications 7 \u21d2 1, 12 \u21d2 1 follow quickly from a classical theorem of Pelczy\u0144ski [P], and the\nsecond of these does not require the separability of X. We prove a generalization of Pelczy\u0144ski's result\nin the Appendix.\nAfter proving Theorem 1 and discussing some complements, we apply it in some detail to the question\nof when l1 embeds in the injective tensor product of two Banach spaces.\nProof. 1 \u21d2 2. Let T : Y \u2192 X \u2217 be an integral operator. Thus there exists a probability space (\u03a9, S, \u03bc)\nand operators U : Y \u2192 L\u221e (\u03bc) and V : L1 (\u03bc) \u2192 X \u2217 such that the following commutative diagram holds\ni\n\nL\u221e (\u03bc) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 L1 (\u03bc)\n\uf8e6\nx\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\nyV\n\uf8e6U\n\n(1)\n\nY\n\nT\n\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\nX\u2217\n\nHere, i : L\u221e (\u03bc) \u2192 L1 (\u03bc) denotes the canonical injection. Suppose T is not compact. Then there exists\na bounded sequence (yn ) such that (T yn ) has no convergent subsequence. Then (as is standard), after\npassing to a subsequence if necessary, we may assume that there is a \u03b4 > 0 so that\n(2)\n\nkT yn \u2212 T ym k \u2265 \u03b4 for all n 6= m .\n\nSince i is weakly compact, so is T ; so again after passing to a subsequence if necessary, we may assume\nthat (T yn ) converges weakly. But now if we consider the sequence (zn ) defined by\n(3)\n\nzn = y2n \u2212 y2n\u22121 for all n ,\n\nthen (zn ) is also bounded of course, and\n(4)\n\nT zn \u2192 0 weakly as n \u2192 \u221e , and kT zn k \u2265 \u03b4 for all n .\n\nThus it follows by the Hahn-Banach theorem that we may choose a sequence (xn ) in the unit ball of X\nsuch that\n(5)\n\n|(T zn )(xn )| \u2265\n\n\u03b4\nfor all n .\n2\n\nNow by the l1 -Theorem [Ro1], (xn ) has a weak-Cauchy subsequence, so let us just assume that (xn )\nis itself weak-Cauchy (note that obviously (5) holds for subsequences (zn\u2032 , x\u2032n ) of the pair (zn , xn )).\nBut now it follows that we may choose n1 < n2 < * * * such that\n(6)\n\n|T znk+1 (xnk )| <\n\n\u03b4\nfor all k .\n4\n\n\fSOME NEW CHARACTERIZATIONS OF BANACH SPACES CONTAINING l1\n\nIndeed, let n1 = 1; since T zn \u2192 0 w\u2217 , we may choose n2 > n1 such that |T zn2 (xn1 )| <\nchosen nk , choose nk+1 > nk such that (6) holds. But now it follows that\n\u03b4\n(7)\n|T znk+1 (xnk+1 \u2212 xnk )| >\nfor all k ,\n4\nand\n(8)\n\n3\n\u03b4\n4.\n\nHaving\n\nxnk+1 \u2212 xnk \u2192 0 weakly.\n\nThus finally, after just re-lettering everything we have that\n(9)\n\n(zn ) is a bounded sequence in Y , (xn ) and (T zn ) both\nconverge to zero weakly, and (5) holds for some \u03b4 > 0.\n\nNow regarding X \u2282 X \u2217\u2217 , we may thus write that\n\u03b4\nfor all n .\n2\nBut T \u2217 is also integral, and in fact admits the factorization\n\n(10)\n\n|hT zn , xn i| = |hT \u2217 xn , zn i| \u2265\ni\n\n(11)\n\nL\u221e (\u03bc) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 L1 (\u03bc)\nx\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6 \u2217\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6V\ny\u0168\nT\u2217\n\nX \u2217\u2217 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 Y \u2217\nwhere \u0168 = U \u2217 | L1 (\u03bc), L1 (\u03bc) regarded as contained in L1 (\u03bc)\u2217\u2217 = (L\u221e (\u03bc))\u2217 .\nBut finally, since L\u221e (\u03bc) has the Dunford-Pettis property and \u0168 i is weakly compact and V \u2217 xn \u2192 0\nweakly,\n(12)\n\nkT \u2217 xn k = k\u0169iV \u2217 (xn )k \u2192 0 as n \u2192 \u221e .\n\nOf course since (zn ) is bounded, this contradicts (10).\n2 \u21d2 3, 2 \u21d2 4, and 2 \u21d2 6 are trivial.\nNext, we show that not 1 \u21d2 not 3, not 4, and not 6, establishing the equivalence of 1, 2, 3, 4, and\n6. We shall need the following basic fact concerning integral operators: If Y \u2282 Z, B is complemented\nin B \u2217\u2217 , and T is an integral operator from Y to B, then T extends to an integral operator from Z\nto B. To see this, choose a probability measure space (\u03a9, S, \u03bc) and operators U : Y \u2192 L\u221e (\u03bc) and\nV : L1 (\u03bc) \u2192 B so that the following diagram commutes:\nL\u221e (\u03bc) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 L1 (\u03bc)\ni\nx\nx\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6U\n\uf8e6V\nY\n\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\nT\n\nB\n\n(where i is the canonical \"identity\" map). Then since L\u221e (\u03bc) has the Hahn Banach extension property,\nwe may choose an operator \u0168 : Z \u2192 L\u221e (\u03bc) extending U , (with k\u0168 k = kU k). Thus V i\u0168 is an integral\noperator extending T , proving our assertion.\nNow suppose l1 embeds in X. Then by a theorem of Pelczy\u0144ski [P]\n(13)\n\n(C([0, 1]))\u2217 embeds in X \u2217 .\n\n(See the Appendix for a more general result.)\nThus in particular,\n(14)\n\nL1 embeds in X \u2217 .\n\nLet Q : l1 \u2192 C[0, 1] be a quotient map, and let i : C[0, 1]) \u2192 L1 be the canonical \"identity\" map\nand also let U : L1 \u2192 X \u2217 be an isomorphic embedding.\nThen T = U iQ is a non-compact integral operator from l1 to X \u2217 , proving not 3. But if we let Y be\na subspace of X and V : Y \u2192 l1 a surjective isomorphism, then the map S = T V is a non-compact\n\n\f4\n\nHASKELL P. ROSENTHAL\n\nintegral operator from Y to X \u2217 , and so has an integral operator extension from X to X \u2217 , proving not 6.\nFinally, let Z be a subspace of L1 isometric to l1 , and A : Z \u2192 l1 a surjective isometry. Then T A is\na non-compact integral operator from Z to X \u2217 , and so has an integral operator extension from X \u2217 to\nX \u2217 by the basic fact above, proving not 4.\n2 \u21d2 5. Let T : X \u2192 Y be an integral operator. Then T \u2217 : Y \u2217 \u2192 X \u2217 is also integral. Hence T \u2217\nis compact, so T is compact. (The result that 1 \u21d2 5 follows from a result due to Pisier; see remark 4\nbelow.)\n5 \u21d2 6 is trivial.\n1 \u21d2 7. Suppose to the contrary that T : L1 \u2192 X \u2217 is a non Dunford-Pettis operator. It follows that\nwe may choose a sequence (fn ) in L1 so that fn \u2192 0 weakly but kT fn k 6\u2192 0. Therefore we may choose\na subsequence (fn\u2032 ) of (fn ) so that for some \u03b4 > 0,\n(15)\n\nkT fn\u2032 k > \u03b4 for all n .\n\nFor each n, choose xn \u2208 X with kxn k = 1 and\n|hT fn\u2032 , xn i| > \u03b4 .\n\n(16)\n\nBy the l1 -Theorem, by passing to a further subsequence if necessary, we may assume that (xn ) is a\nweak-Cauchy sequence. But then it follows that\n(17)\n\n(T \u2217 xn ) is a weak Cauchy sequence in L\u221e\n\n(where we regard X as canonically embedded in X \u2217 ).\nSince L1 has the Dunford-Pettis property, it follows that\n(18)\n\n|hfn\u2032 , T \u2217 xn i| \u2192 0 as n \u2192 \u221e ,\n\nwhich contradicts (16). (A Banach space B has the Dunford-Pettis property if every weakly compact\noperator T : B \u2192 Y is Dunford-Pettis, for all Y . By fundamental results of Grothendieck [G1], this is\nequivalent to: (bn ) weakly null in B, (fn ) weakly null in B \u2217 implies fn (bn ) \u2192 0 as n \u2192 \u221e. It is then a\nstandard exercise to show that in fact if (bn ) is weakly null and (fn ) is weak-Cauchy, still fn (bn ) \u2192 0\nas n \u2192 \u221e.)\nNot 1\u21d2 not 7. Since L1 is isomorphic to a subspace of X \u2217 when 1 fails, this is immediate: An (into)\nisomorphism T : L1 \u2192 X \u2217 is obviously not Dunford-Pettis.\n1 \u21d2 8. Let (xn ) be a bounded sequence in X. Choose (by the l1 -Theorem) (x\u2032n ) a weak Cauchy\nsubsequence of (xn ); then given (ni ) and (mi ) strictly increasing sequences of positive integers, (x\u2032ni \u2212\nx\u2032mi ) is weakly null, and hence by hypothesis\nkT (x\u2032ni \u2212 x\u2032mi )k = kT x\u2032ni \u2212 T \u2032 xmi k \u2192 0 as i \u2192 \u221e .\nThis implies (T x\u2032n ) is a Cauchy sequence in Y , so it converges since Y is complete; thus T is compact.\n8 \u21d2 5. Integral operators are Dunford-Pettis operators because L\u221e (\u03bc)-spaces have the DunfordPettis property and integral operators factor through the \"identity\" map i : L\u221e (\u03bc) \u2192 L1 (\u03bc), for some\nprobability measure \u03bc; of course i is weakly compact.\n1 \u21d2 9. Suppose to the contrary that (u\u03b1 )\u03b1<w1 is an uncountable unconditional family in X \u2217 ; let U\nbe the norm closure of its linear span. Assume ku\u03b1 k = 1 for all \u03b1; letting (u\u2217\u03b1 ) be the functions in U \u2217\nbiorthogonal to (u\u03b1 ), choose K so that kuK\n\u03b1 k \u2264 K for all \u03b1. Now we have the following fundamental\nclaim:\n(19)\n\nGiven f \u2208 U \u2217 , then Wf = {\u03b1 : f (u\u03b1 ) 6= 0} is countable.\n\nIf this were false, say then f = U \u2217 , kf k = 1, and Wf is countable. Then we may pass to an uncountable\nsubset \u0393 of Wf such that there exists a \u03b4 > 0 so that\n(20)\n\n|f (u\u03b1 )| \u2265 \u03b4 for all \u03b1 \u2208 \u0393 .\n\nBut now a standard argument shows that\n(21)\n\n(u\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208\u0393 is equivalent to the natural basis of l1 (\u0393) .\n\n\fSOME NEW CHARACTERIZATIONS OF BANACH SPACES CONTAINING l1\n\n5\n\nThus l1 (\u0393) embeds in X \u2217 , which implies l1 embeds in X, by a result of Pelczy\u0144ski [P], Hagler [H1], a\ncontradiction.\n1 \u21d2 9. This is due to R. Haydon [Hay]. For X separable, this had previously been proved by E.\nOdell and myself [OR].\n9 \u21d2 10. If K satisfies the hypothesis of 10, so does K\u0303 = {\u03b1k : \u03b1 is a scalar, |\u03b1| = 1, k \u2208 K}. But\nthen it follows that the w\u2217 -closed convex hull W of K\u0303 has non-empty interior, and hence since then\nalso Ext W \u2282 K\u0303 and 9 implies W is the norm closed convex hull of Ext W , [K] = [K\u0303] = X \u2217 .\n10 \u21d2 1. This follows from a result of G. Godefroy [G1]. Indeed, assume that l1 embeds in X. Then\nit is proved in [Gr1] that there exists an equivalent norm ||| * ||| on X such that if K denotes the w\u2217\nclosure of the extreme points of the ball of X \u2217 in the dual norm induced by ||| * |||, then [K] 6= X \u2217 . But\nof course then K is an isomorphically norming w\u2217 -compact subset of X \u2217 in its original norm, proving\nthat 10 does not hold. There is a minor point here that requires explanation, however. The cited result\nof Godefroy's requires the fundamental case where X = l1 itself, for the proof. But the argument given\nin [G1] is only valid for the case of complex scalars. The result for real scalars may be deduced from\nthe work in [G1] as follows: First, to avoid ambiguity, let lpR , resp. lpC , denote lp for real scalars, resp.\nfor complex scalars, p = 1 or \u221e. It is proved in [G1] that for complex scalars, there exists an equivalent\nnorm ||| * ||| on l1C so that if K is as above, and Y is the closed linear span of K over the complex scalars,\nthen there exists an infinite subset M of N with infinite complement so that\ninf{|y(n) \u2212 y(n\u2032 )| : n \u2208 M, n\u2032 \u2208 N \u223c M } = 0 for all y \u2208 Y .\n\n(22)\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\n\u221e\nNow let ||| * ||| be the dual norm induced on l\u221e\nC , and just regard (lC , ||| * ||| ) as a real Banach space.\n\u221e\n\u221e\nNow if we take the standard norm on lC and regard this as a real Banach space, we obtain l\u221e\nR \u2295 lR\nunder the norm\nq\n(23)\nk(aj ) \u2295 (bj )k = sup a2j + b2j for (aj ), (bj ) \u2208 l\u221e\nR\nj\n\n\u221e\n\u221e\nwhich is obviously equivalent to the standard norm on l\u221e\nR \u2295 lR , which of course is isometric to lR .\n\u2217\n\u221e\nThen it follows also that the norm ||| * ||| must be equivalent to the standard norm k * k\u221e on lR \u2295 l\u221e\nR\n(where obviously we take the isomorphism (aj + ibj ) \u2192 ((aj ), (bj )) for (aj + ibj ) \u2208 l\u221e\nC ).\nNow let c00 denote the space of all sequences of reals which are ultimately zero.

Moreover, we have that a bounded\n1\n\u2217\n\u221e\nsequence (fn ) in l\u221e\nC converges in the w topology on lC induced by lC iff\n(25)\n\nlim fn (j) exists for all j\n\nbn\u2192\u221e\n\niff\n(26)\n\nlim Re fn (j) and\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nlim Im fn (j) exist for all j\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\niff\n(27)\n\n\u2217\n\u221e\n\u221e\n{(Re fn \u2295 Im fn )\u221e\nn=1 converges in the w -topology on lR \u2295 lR } .\n\n\u221e\n\u221e\nIt follows that the w\u2217 -topology on l\u221e\nC is the same as that on lR \u2295 lR , and hence the unit ball of\n\u2217\n\u221e\n\u221e\n\u2217\n(lR \u2295 lR , ||| * ||| ) is compact in the w -topology; thus by the bipolar theorem, that ball is precisely the\ndual ball of (l1R \u2295 l1R , ||| * |||); hence the set K defined above is exactly the same as that defined for the\nreal scalars case above. Finally, it follows that if YR denotes the norm closed linear span of K over real\n\u221e\n\u221e\nscalars, then we have that if (aj )\u221e\nj=1 \u2295 (bj )j=1 \u2208 YR , (aj + ibj )j=1 \u2208 Y , and hence by (22), we obtain\nthat\n\n(28)\n\ninf{max{|an \u2212 a\u2032n |, |bn \u2212 b\u2032n |} : n \u2208 M, n\u2032 \u2208 N \u223c M } = 0\n\n\f6\n\nHASKELL P.

This is trivial.\nIt follows from the main result in [OR] that every element of X \u2217\u2217 is the limit of a weak Cauchy\nsequence in X, which yields 15. (1 \u21d2 15 is also given in [OR].)\n1 \u21d2 13.

It follows by the l1 -theorem that given (x\u0302ni ) a subsequence of (x\u0302n ), then (xni ) has a weakCauchy subsequence, which implies that (x\u0302ni ) has a subsequence pointwise convergent on K. Now the\nresults of [Ro2] prove the conclusion of 17 (and also imply, by the way, that any pointwise cluster point\nof (x\u0302n ) is the limit of a pointwise convergent subsequence of (xn )).\n17 \u21d2 18. Let K be the unit ball of X \u2217 . Then of course (x\u0302n ) has a pointwise cluster point on K,\nwhich is just an element of X \u2217\u2217 restricted to K. This is a Baire-one functions on K by [OR], and so of\ncourse is Borel measurable and hence universally measurable.\n17 \u21d2 19. The cardinality of the class of Baire-one functions on K equals c < 2c .\n18 \u21d2 1. It suffices to prove that any bounded sequence (xn ) in X has a subsequence (xni ) so that\n(x\u0302ni ) converges pointwise on K. For then, it follows by the Hahn-Banach, Riesz-representation, and\nbounded convergence theorems that (xni ) is a weak-Cauchy sequence, and so 1 holds. But if this is\nnot the case, then we find a bounded sequence (xn ) in X such that (x\u0302n ) has no pointwise convergent\nsubsequence on K. It now follows by a theorem of Bourgain-Fremlin-Talagrand [BFT] that (x\u0302n ) has a\nsubsequence, none of whose pointwise cluster points are universally measurable on K, thus contradicting\n18. (For an alternate proof of the cited result, see Theorem 3.18 in [Ro3].)\nIt remains to prove that 12, 16, and 19 imply 1. We shall prove the contrapositive implications\ninstead. So we assume for the rest of the proof that l1 embeds in X and X is separable. (We don't\nneed the separability assumption for the first two implications.)\nl1c is isometric to the space of atomic Borel measures on [0, 1], and so isometric to a subspace of\nC[0, 1)\u2217 . Thus by (8),\n(34)\n\nl1c is isomorphic to a subspace of X \u2217 ,\n\nso 12 does not hold.\n\u2217\u2217\nIt also follows that 16 does not hold, for by (34), l\u221e\nc is isomorphic to a quotient space of X , and\nhence\n(35)\n\ncard X \u2217\u2217 \u2265 cc = 2c .\n\n\fSOME NEW CHARACTERIZATIONS OF BANACH SPACES CONTAINING l1\n\n7\n\n(These implications are of course known.)\nNot 1 \u21d2 Not 19. Let K be a w\u2217 -compact isomorphically norming subset of X \u2217 . Then it follows\nagain by the theorems cited in the proof of 18 \u21d2 1, that if (xn ) is a bounded sequence in X such that\n(x\u0302n ) converges pointwise on K, then (xn ) is a weak Cauchy sequence in X. Thus there must exist some\nbounded sequence (xn ) in X such that (x\u0302n ) has no pointwise convergent subsequence on K. Hence this\nimplication follows (since obviously the family of pointwise cluster points on K has cardinality at most\n2c ) from\nLemma 2. Let K be a compact Hausdorff space and (fn ) be a bounded sequence of continuous scalarvalued functions on K which has no pointwise convergent subsequence. Then the family F of pointwise\ncluster points of (fn ) on K has cardinality at least 2c .\nProof. We may obviously assume the fn 's are real valued since either the real or imaginary parts of the\nfn 's have no pointwise convergent subsequence, and the real or imaginary part of a pointwise cluster\npoint of (fn ) is also a pointwise cluster point of the real or imaginary parts of the fn 's. By the proof\nof the l1 -Theorem ([Ro1]; see also [Ro3]), there exists a subsequence (fn\u2032 ) of (fn ) with the following\nproperty:\n(\u2217) There exist real numbers r and \u03b4 with \u03b4 > 0 such that setting An = {k : fn\u2032 (k) \u2264\nr \u2212 \u03b4} and Bn = {k : fn\u2032 (k) \u2265 r + \u03b4}, then these are non-empty sets for all n, such\nthat ((An , Bn )) is a Boolean independent sequence; that is, if one sets +An = An and\n\u2212An = Bn , then for any infinite sequence (\u03b5j ) with \u03b5j = \u00b11 for all j,\nn\n\\\n\n(36)\n\n\u03b5j Aj is non-empty for all n .\n\nj=1\n\nThis implies\n\u221e\n\\\n\n(37)\n\n\u03b5j Aj is non-empty,\n\nj=1\n\nsince for all n, fn\u2032 is continuous, and thus An , Bn are closed and non-empty, and so (37) follows by\nthe compactness of K. Now let U be the family of all non-principal ultrafilters on N (cf. [CN] for the\ndefinition and standard properties of ultrafilters). Then as is classical, U may be identified the \u03b2N \u223c N,\nwhere \u03b2N denotes the Stone-C\u011bach compactification of N, and so by a classical theorem in topology (cf.\nTheorem 2, page 132 of [E]),\ncard U = 2c .\n\n(38)\n\n(This is also explicitly given in 7.4 Corollary, page 146 of [CN].)\nFor each U \u2208 U, define a function fU on K by\nfU (k) = lim fn\u2032 (k) for all k \u2208 K .\n\n(39)\n\nn\u2208U\n\nThen as is standard, fU is a pointwise cluster point of (fn\u2032 ) and hence of (fn ).

The equivalence we have used in the proof of 10 \u21d2 1 is actually quantitative. That is, we have\nthe following fact.\nProposition A. Given X and \u03bb \u2265 1, the following are equivalent:\n(i) There exists a weak*-compact \u03bb-norming subset K of Ba X \u2217 so that [K] 6= X \u2217 .\n(ii) There exists a norm ||| * ||| on X so that\nk * k \u2264 ||| * ||| \u2264 \u03bbk * k\n\u2217\n\n(k * k the original norm)\n\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\nwith [K] 6= X , where K is the w -closure of the extreme points of Ba(X \u2217 , ||| * ||| ).\nProof. (i) \u21d2 (ii): Let W = {\u03b1k : |\u03b1| = 1, k \u2208 K}. Then W is also w\u2217 -compact. Then it follows by the\ngeometrical form of the Hahn-Banach Theorem that if K\u0303 denotes the w\u2217 -closed convex hull of W , then\nK\u0303 \u2282 Ba X \u2282 \u03bb Ba K\u0303 ;\nin turn, we then easily obtain a norm ||| * ||| on X satisfying the inequality in (ii) such that K\u0303 =\nBa(X \u2217 , ||| * |||\u2217 ). But then it follows that Ext K\u0303 \u2282 W which implies (ii). (ii) \u21d2 (i) is immediate for\nK is then \u03bb-norming.\n\u0003\nNow the arguments in [G1] yield\nProposition B. There exists an absolute constant C so that if l1 embeds in X, there exists a C-norming\nw\u2217 -compact subset K of Ba X \u2217 with [K] 6= X \u2217 .\nThe question then arises:\nProblem 1. If l1 embeds in X, is it so that given \u03b5 > 0, there exists a \u03bb \u2264 1 + \u03b5 satisfying (i) of\nProposition A?\nThe delicate nature of the proof of 10 \u21d2 1 leads me to conjecture that the answer is negative for\nX = l1 itself. Of course if so, it is natural to ask: What is the optimal value of C in Proposition B? Now\nof course if X = C(K) for some uncountable compact metric space, \u03bb = 1 works. However \u03bb = 1 does\nnot work for X = l1 . For then by the arguments sketched above, we would have that the norm-closed\nlinear span of the w\u2217 -closure of Ba l\u221e would be unequal to l\u221e . But standard arguments show that the\nnorm-closed convex hull of Ext Ba l\u221e = Ba l\u221e .\n1b. Some interesting equivalences are also obtained in [G1], complementary to the above discussion.\nThe following notion is introduced there:\nDefinition. Let K be a non-empty closed bounded convex subset of X \u2217 , and W \u2282 K. W is called a\nboundary of K if for all x \u2208 X, sup[Re(\u03c7x) | W ] is attained on W .\nThe following result is obtained in [G1], generalizing the theorem of [OR] that 9 \u21d2 1 for separable\nX, and yielding an analogy of James' famous characterization of weakly compact convex sets.\nTheorem.

I am indebted to Welfeng Chen for a stimulating conversation concerning the implication 1 \u21d2 12.\n3. Suppose X is separable and X \u2217 is non-separable. A remarkable result of Stegall yields that\nthen X \u2217 has a biorthogonal family of cardinality the continuum [S]. Since there are now known many\nseparable spaces X not containing l1 with X \u2217 nonseparable (cf. [AMP], [H2], [J3], [K], [LS], [Ro5]), we\ncannot significantly weaken the unconditionality assertion in 11 and 12. This same result incidentally\nshows that dens X \u2217\u2217 = dens X \u2217 = c; thus assuming l1 does not embed in X, we obtain that all cardinal\nmeasures of the size of X \u2217 , X \u2217\u2217 , L(X \u2217 ) yield the same result. (For a metric space M , dens M denotes\nthe least cardinality of a dense subset.)\n4. The following essentially known result gives equivalences for the embedability of l1 in X and\nthe structure of p-absolutely summing operators on X, analogous to the equivalences 1. through 4. of\nTheorem 1.\nTheorem. Let X be given. The following are equivalent.\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n\nl1 does not embed in X.\nFor all Y and 1 \u2264 p < \u221e, every p-absolutely summing operator from X to Y is compact.\nEvery 2-summing operator from X to l2 is compact.\nEvery 2-summing operator from X to X \u2217 is compact.\n\nProof. 1 \u21d2 2. This is due to G. Pisier (Corollary 1.7, part (iii) of [Pi]). For the sake of completeness,\nwe give the argument. Let T : X \u2192 Y be a p-absolutely summing operator. By a fundamental theorem\nof Pietsch (cf., [LP] or Theorem 1.3 of [Pi]), there exists a regular Borel probability measure \u03bc on\n\u2217\nK = Ba X \u2217 endowed\nand a C < \u221e so that\nR with pthe w -topology\n(a) kT xk \u2264 C( K |w(x)| l\u03bc(w))1/p for all x \u2208 X.\nNow let (xn ) be a bounded sequence in X, and choose a weak-Cauchy subsequence (x\u2032n ) by the l1 Theorem. We claim that\n(b) (T x\u2032n ) converges in the norm topology of Y .\nTo prove this, since Y is a Banach space, we employ the following elegant characterization of Cauchy\nsequences, due to Pelczy\u0144ski: It suffices to show that\n(c) kT x\u2032ni \u2212 T x\u2032mi k \u2192 0 as i \u2192 \u221e for all strictly increasing sequences (ni ), (mi ) of N.\nBut given such sequences, (xni \u2212 xmi ) is a weakly null sequence in X. Now letting i : C(K) \u2192 Lp (\u03bc)\nbe the natural injection and U : X \u2192 C(K) the canonical map given by: (U x)(k) = k(x) for all x \u2208 X,\nk \u2208 K, then since i is weakly compact and C(K) has the Dunford-Pettis property,\n(d) kiU (x\u2032ni \u2212 x\u2032mi )k \u2192 0 as i \u2192 \u221e\nBut (a) yields that\n(f) kT (x\u2032ni \u2212 x\u2032mi )k \u2264 CkiU (x\u2032ni \u2212 x\u2032mi kLp(\u03bc) for all i.\n2 \u21d2 3, 2 \u21d2 4 are trivial. Now suppose l1 embeds in X. Thus by Pelczy\u0144ski's theorem, (8) holds,\nand since l2 embeds in L1 , which thus embeds in X \u2217 , it is obviously enough to show that condition 3\nof the Theorem fails to hold. Now simply let T : l1 \u2192 l2 be defined by: T ej = bj for all j, where ej is\nthe l1 -basis, (bj ) the l2 -basis. It follows that T is absolutely summing, by Grothendieck's fundamental\ntheorem [G2] (although the direct proof of this elementary fact is much simpler). Let Z be a subspace\nof X isomorphic to l1 and let S : Z \u2192 l1 be a surjective isomorphism. It follows that T S is absolutely\nsumming. Hence T S is 2-absolutely summing, which implies T S is 2-integral and hence T S entends to\na 2-integral operator V : X \u2192 l2 . V is thus 2-absolutely summing, but since T is not compact, neither\nis V .\n\u0003\n\n\f10\n\nHASKELL P. ROSENTHAL\n\nComment . It thus follows that 1 \u21d2 5 of Theorem 1 can be deduced from the above Theorem, since\nintegral operators are asbolutely summing.\n5. The proof of 6 \u21d2 1 yields an integral non-compact operator from l1 to L1 (and also 6 \u21d2 1 follows\nfrom this and Pelczy\u0144ski's theorem cited there). The following is a more natural example of such an\noperator. Letting (en ) be the l1 basis, define T by: T en = sin 2\u03c0nx for all n. T is obviously not compact.\nR1\nTo see that T is an integral operator, define S : C[0, 1] \u2192 c0 by: (Sf )n = 0 f (x) sin 2\u03c0nx dx for all\nn \u2208 N . Then S is an integral operator, because if we define V : L1 \u2192 c0 by : (V f )n =\u220810 f (x) sin 2\u03c0nx\nfor all n \u2208 N , then S = V i, where i : C[0, 1] \u2192 L1 is the canonical map. Therefore S \u2217 is integral; it is\neasily verified that S \u2217 = T .\nIf K satisfies the hypothesis of 9, then if we renorm X by |||x||| = sup{|k(x)| : k \u2208 K}, K now\nisometrically norms (X, ||| * |||), and so also \u03a9 = {\u03b1k : \u03b1 is a scalar, |\u03b1| = 1, k \u2208 K} isometrically norms\n(X, ||| * |||) and is w\u2217 -compact. Hence the w\u2217 -closed convex hull of \u03a9 equals D, the unit ball of X \u2217 in\n\u2217\n||| * ||| , and moreover the extreme points of D are contained in \u03a9. Thus by 9, the norm-closed convex\nhull of \u03a9 = D, so of course [\u03a9] = [K] = X \u2217 .\n7. Results of Bourgain in [Bo1], [Bo2] yield the following remarkable result.\nTheorem. Assume X is separable.

There does not exist a subset of the extreme points of Ba X \u2217 equivalent to the basis of l1c .\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n\n(Note that 3 \u21d2 1 follows from Pelczy\u0144ski's theorem and does not require the separability of X, for l1c\nhas the RNP.) He then deduces in [Bo2] that if X is non-separable, E Ba X \u2217 is non-separable in norm.\n(EW denotes the extreme points of W .) For if l1 is not isomorphic to a subspace of X, X \u2217 = [E Ba X \u2217 ]\nby the result of Haydon [Hay]. If l1 embeds in X, then there is a separable subspace Y of X so that\ncard E Ba Y \u2217 = c by 4 \u21d2 1 of the above Theorem, but as is standard, every extreme pont of Ba Y \u2217 lifts\nto an extreme point of Ba X \u2217 , so card E Ba X \u2217 \u2265 c. The Theorem established by Bourgain in [Bo1]\nwhich gives 4 \u21d2 1, also yields the following striking improvement of Pelczy\u0144ski's theorem cited in the\nproof of 12 \u21d2 1 of our Theorem 1. If l1 embeds in X, X separable, then for all 1 > \u03b5 > 0, there exists\na subset K of E Ba X \u2217 homeomorphic to the Cantor set, such that for all f \u2208 (1 \u2212 \u03b5) Ba C(K), there\nexists an x \u2208 X with kxk < 1 and f (k) = k(x) for all k \u2208 K. It follows that for all \u03b5 > 0, E Ba X \u2217 has\na subset (1 + \u03b5)-equivalent to the basis for l1c .\n8. Theorem 3.18 of [Ro3] yields the following result, strengthening the result in [BFT] used in proving\n18 \u21d2 1 of Theorem 1.\nTheorem. Let K be a compact metric space and (fn ) a bounded sequence in C(K) with no pointwise\nconvergent subsequence. Then there exists a subsequence (fn\u2032 ) of (fn ) and a Borel probability measure\n\u03bc on K such that no point-wise cluster point of (fn\u2032 ) is \u03bc-measurable.\nIt follows that we may replace the implications 18, 19 \u21d2 1 by the following stronger statement: If\nl1 embeds in X (assumed separable) and K is a weak*-compact norming subset of X \u2217 , there exists a\nbounded sequence (xn ) in X such that (x\u0302n ) (as defined in 17) has 2c pointwise cluster points on K,\nnone of which are universally measurable.\nApplying Lemma 2, we obtain from the Theorem\nCorollary A. If (fn ) satisfies the hypotheses of the Theorem, there exists a Borel probability measure\n\u03bc on K such that there is a set W of cardinality 2c , consisting of point-wise cluster points of (fn ), none\nof which are \u03bc-measurable.\nHere is another applcation, due to Stegall.\n\n\fSOME NEW CHARACTERIZATIONS OF BANACH SPACES CONTAINING l1\n\n11\n\nCorollary B. Let W be a weakly pre-compact subset of a Banach space. Then the closed convex hull\nof W is weakly pre-compact.\n(W is called weakly pre-compact of every sequence in W has a weak-Cauchy subsequence.)\nProof. It obviously suffices to prove that co W , the convex hull of W , is weakly pre-compact. Any\nsequence in co W is contained in the convex hull of a countable subset of W , so we may assume\nw.l.g. W is separable. Note incidentally that any weakly pre-compact set is bounded, since weakCauchy sequences are bounded by the uniform boundedness principle. Thus, suppose that C < \u221e,\nkwk \u2264 C for all w \u2208 W , and to the contrary, there exists a sequence (fn ) in co W with no weak-Cauchy\nsubsequence. Now letting K = (Ba X \u2217 , w\u2217 ) and x\u0302(k) = k(x) for all x \u2208 W and k \u2208 K, (f\u02c6n ) \u2282 C(K)\nthus has no pointwise convergent subsequence on K, and so by the above Theorem, choose \u03bc a Borel\nprobability measure on K and (fn\u2032 ) a subsequence of (fn ) such that no point-wise cluster point of (f\u02c6n\u2032 )\nis \u03bc-measurable. Now letting i : C(K) \u2192 L1 (\u03bc) be the canonical map, it follows by the bounded\nconvergence theorem that i(W ) is a relatively compact subset of L1 (\u03bc). But then coi(W ) = icoW is\n\u2032\u2032\nalso a relatively compact set. So then, choose (fn\u2032\u2032 ) a subsequence of (fn\u2032 ) such that (ifc\nn ) converges in\n1\n\u2032\u2032\n \u0303\nL (\u03bc), and finally choose (fn ) a subsequence of (fn ) such that (fn ) converges \u03bc-almost everywhere, to\na function g in L1 (\u03bc). But then any point-wise cluseter point of (fc\u0303 ) equals g almost everywhere, and\nn\n\nis hence \u03bc-measurable; of course all such are point-wise cluster points of (f\u02c6n\u2032 ), a contradiction.\n\n\u0003\n\nCorollary C. l1 does not embed in X iff there exists a weakly precompact subset of X isomorphically\nnorming X \u2217 .\nProof. If l1 does not embed in X, W = Ba X is weakly precompact, by the l1 -Theorem. Suppose\nconversely W is a weakly precompact subset of X, isomorphically norming X \u2217 . It is easily seen that\ndef\nW\u0303 = {\u03b1w : |\u03b1| = 1} is also weakly pre-compact and hence coW\u0303 , the closed convex hull of W\u0303 , is weakly\npre-compact by Corollary B. The Hahn-Banach Theorem (geometrical form) implies coW\u0303 contains\nE Ba X for some \u03b5 > 0, showing that every bounded sequence in X has a weak-Cauchy subsequence. \u0003\nIt is interesting to compare the equivalences 1\u20133 of Theorem 1 with the following equivalences, given\nin [DU] (see Theorem 8, page 175 of [DU]; 3 \u21d2 1 is due to Uhl and 1 \u21d2 3 is due to Stegall).\nTheorem. Let X be given. Then the following are equivalent.\n1. X \u2217 has the Radon-Nikodym property (RNP).\n2. Every integral operator from Y to X \u2217 is nuclear, for all Y .\n3. Y \u2217 is separable for all separable Y \u2282 X \u2217 .\nHowever this does not yield the sharp equivalence analogous to the one we obtain in 1 \u21d4 3 in\nTheorem 1.\nProblem 2. Let X be a separable Banach space. When does there exist an integral non-nuclear operator\non X \u2217 ?\nNow if X \u2217 has the\nnuclear. But also,\nintegral implies T \u2217\nNow if X \u2217 has the\n\u2228\n\nRadon-Nikodym property, then by the above Theorem, every operator on X \u2217 is\nif X \u2217\u2217 has the RNP, then: T : X \u2217 \u2192 X \u2217 integral implies T \u2217 : X \u2217\u2217 \u2192 X \u2217\u2217\nis nuclear implies T is nuclear, since X \u2217 is contractively complemented in X \u2217\u2217\u2217 .\napproximation property (ap) in addition, then (again by Grothendieck's results),\n\u2227\n\n(K(X))\u2217 = (X \u2217 \u2295 X)\u2217 = X \u2217\u2217 \u2295 X \u2217 isometrically. This is so because Grothendieck's results yield that\n(K(X))\u2217 = I(X \u2217 ), the space of integral operators on X \u2217 (because X has the ap). But then in the case\nX \u2217\u2217 has the RNP, we also have that the integral norm of T on X \u2217 equals the integral norm of T \u2217\u2217 ,\nwhich equals the nuclear norm of T \u2217\u2217 , which equals the nuclear norm of T \u2217 , which is then the same as\n\u2228\n\nits projective tensor norm. Also, (X \u2217\u2217 \u2295 X \u2217 )\u2217 = L(X \u2217\u2217 ) isometrically. We may thus summarize this\ndiscussion as follows.\n\n\f12\n\nHASKELL P. ROSENTHAL\n\nProposition 3. Let X be a Banach space such that X \u2217 has the ap and X \u2217 or X \u2217\u2217 have the RNP.\n\u2227\n\nThen every integral operator on X \u2217 is nuclear, K(X)\u2217 = X \u2217\u2217 \u2295 X \u2217 isometrically and K(X)\u2217\u2217 = L(X \u2217\u2217 )\nisometrically.\nWe show later on, however, that there exist separable Banach space X so that X \u2217\u2217 has the metric\napproximation property, X and X \u2217 fail the RNP, yet still every integral operator on X \u2217 is nuclear.\nRemark. The above discussion also shows that given X and Y , then if X \u2217 or Y \u2217 has the ap and either\n\u2228\n\n\u2227\n\nX \u2217 or Y \u2217 has the RNP, then (X \u2295 Y )\u2217 = X \u2217 \u2295 Y \u2217 isometrically. A slightly weaker result then this is\ndue to Grothendieck ([Gr2]; see also [DFS]).\nWe now pass to a detailed discussion of the following problem:\n\u2228\n\nProblem 3. Under what conditions on Banach spaces X and Y is it so that l1 embeds in X \u2297Y , the\ninjective tensor product of X and Y ?\nWe solve this problem, for separable Banach spaces X and Y such that X \u2217 or Y \u2217 have the bounded\napproximation property (bap), in Theorem 6 below. This also yields a partial answer to Problem 2. (Of\ncourse under the ap assumption, the problem reduces to the study of separable spaces anyway, because\nif e.g. X \u2217 has the bap, then we show in Lemma 9 that given X0 a separable subspace of X, there exists\na separable subspace X1 , of X with X1 \u2283 X0 such that X1\u2217 has the bounded approximation property.\n\u2228\n\nThus if l1 embeds in X \u2297Y and X \u2217 or Y \u2217 have the bap, there must exist X1 , Y1 separable subspaces of\n\u2228\n\nX and Y so that X1\u2217 or Y1\u2217 has the bap and l1 embeds in X1 \u2297Y1 ).\nWe shall freely use the standard (but rather non-trivial!) results concerning tensor products of\nBanach spaces, due to Grothendieck [Gr2], as also exposed in [DU]. For Banach spaces X and Y ,\nI(X, Y ) denotes the space of integral operators from X to Y and N (X, Y ) the space of nuclear operators\nfrom X to Y . For the definitions, including the norms, of these spaces, see the above references.\n\u2228\n\nOur next result provides as with sufficient conditions for l1 to not embed in X \u2297Y .\nCorollary 4. Let X and Y be given Banach spaces, neither containing an isomorph of l1 , such that\n\u2228\n\nX \u2217 or Y \u2217 has the RNP. Then l1 does not embed into X \u2297Y .\nProof. It obviously suffices to prove this for the case where X and Y are both separable. By a result of\nGrothendieck, we also have that\n\u2228\n\n(X \u2297Y )\u2217 = I(X, Y \u2217 ) = N (X, Y \u2217 )\n\n(47)\n(via trace duality).

But since Y \u2217 is a separable Banach space,\nY \u2217\u2217 is isometric to a subspace of l\u221e , and hence by Theorem 1, part 11, L(X \u2217 , Y \u2217\u2217 ) has cardinality c,\n\u2228\n\nand so we have proved that (X \u2297Y )\u2217\u2217 has cardinality c, using (47)\u2013(49).

By the argument given in the proof of 1 \u21d2 9 \u21d2 10 of\n\u2228\n\nTheorem 1, it follows from [Hay] that [K] = (X \u2297Y )\u2217 = I(X, Y \u2217 ). This proves Proposition 5.\n\n\u0003\n\nRemarks. 1. For X and Y separable, Proposition 5 follows by Theorem 1, part 10.\n2. Of course this result holds if we interchange X and Y in its statement, which is more naturally\ngiven in the language of tensor products: For separable Banach spaces X and Y , if l1 does not embed\n\u2228\n\n\u2228\n\nin X \u2297Y , then (X \u2297Y )\u2217 equals the closure of X \u2297 Y in the space of integral bilinear forms on X \u2217 \u00d7 Y \u2217 .\n3. It is apparently an open problem if the nuclear and integral norms coincide or are equivalent on\nF (X, Y \u2217 ), X, Y given (F (Z, W ) denotes the space of finite rank operators from Z to W ). Of course if\nthis should be the case, for X, Y satisfying the hypotheses of the Proposition, then its conclusion can\nbe strengthened to state: Then every integral operator from X to Y \u2217 is nuclear.\nWe may now give a definitive solution to Problem 2, under an approximation property assumption.\nTheorem 6. Let X and Y be separable Banach spaces such that X \u2217 or Y \u2217 has the bounded approximation property.

As in the preceding result, we may (obviously) interchange X and Y in the statement of\nTheorem 6.\nProof. Suppose first that 1 holds. The approximation property assumption insures that the integral\nand nuclear norms are equivalent on F (X, Y \u2217 ), and these in turn are equivalent to the projective tensor\nproduct norm. The final statement now follows from Proposition 5 and the fact (due to Grothendieck)\n\u2228\n\nthat (X \u2297Y )\u2217 = I(X, Y \u2217 ); of course then 2 follows by Theorem 1 (i.e., by [OR]).\n2 \u21d2 3 is trivial.\nNow suppose that 3 holds, and assume that\n(50)\n\nX \u2217 has the approximation property .\n\nLet K = {x\u2217 \u2297 y \u2217 : (x\u2217 , y \u2217 ) \u2208 Ba X \u2217 \u00d7 Ba Y \u2217 )}, endowed with its w\u2217 -topology as a subset of I(X, Y \u2217 ) =\n\u2228\n\n\u2228\n\n(X \u2297Y )\u2217 . Thus K is a w\u2217 -compact isometrically norming subset of (X \u2297Y )\u2217 .

If X and Y are given such that L1 embeds in X \u2217 \u2297Y \u2217 ; does L1 embed in X \u2217 or Y \u2217 ?\nBy the results in [H1] and [P], an affirmative answer holds for particular X, Y iff l1 embeds in X or\nY . An affirmative answer to Problem 5 implies an affirmative answer to Problem 4. For suppose to\n\u2228\n\nthe contrary, that X, Y provide a counterexample to Problem 4. Since l1 embeds in X \u2297Y , L1 embeds\n\u2228\n\nin (X \u2297Y )\u2217 = I(X, Y \u2217 ). But since l1 does not embed in X or Y , L1 does not embed in X \u2217 or Y \u2217 ,\n\u2227\n\nand so if the answer to the second part of 5 is affirmative, L1 does not embed in X \u2217 \u2297Y \u2217 , which thus\ncannot equal I(X, Y \u2217 ) contradicting the final statement in Theorem 6. (See remark 4 following proof\nof Theorem 11 for further comments on Problem 5.)\n\n\fSOME NEW CHARACTERIZATIONS OF BANACH SPACES CONTAINING l1\n\n15\n\nRemark. If we do not deal with dual spaces in Problem 5, then the answer is negative. A remarkable\nresult of Talagrand [T] asserts the existence of separable spaces X and Y so that L1 embeds in X \u2295 Y\nbut L1 does not embed in X or Y . It follows, since L1 is isomorphic to a finite codimensional subspace\nof itself, that also L1 embeds in X \u2295 Y0 if Y0 is of codimension 1 in Y . Let x0 , y0 be norm one elements\nof X \u2217 , Y \u2217 respectively; choose x\u22170 , y0\u2217 norm one elements of X \u2217 , Y \u2217 with x\u22170 (x0 ) = y0\u2217 (y0 ) = 1, and let\n\u2227\n\n\u1ef8 = y0\u22a5 . Then X \u2297 [y0 ] and [x0 ] \u2297 \u1ef8 are isometric to X and \u1ef8 in X \u2297Y , and I \u2297 (y0\u2217 \u2297 y0 ) is a\n\u2227\n\ncontractive projection from X \u2297Y onto X \u2297 [y0 ] with [x0 ] \u2297 \u1ef8 contained in its kernel. It follows that\n\u2227\n\n\u2227\n\n(X \u2295 [y0 ]) + ([x0 ] \u2297 \u1ef8 ) is isomorphic to X \u2295 \u1ef8 in X \u2297Y and thus L1 embeds in X \u2297Y .\nOf course this counterexample cannot simply lead to a counterexample for Problem 4, because if L1\nembeds in X \u2217 \u2295 Y \u2217 , l1 embeds in X \u2295 Y by [H1] and [P], and then obviously l1 embeds in X or Y .\nNevertheless, I am inclined to believe that the answer to problem 3 and hence to problem 4 is negative.\nLeter on, we give examples where in fact l1 does not embed in X \u2217 or Y \u2217 , both X \u2217 and Y \u2217 have the\n\u2228\n\n\u2227\n\nmetric approximation property and fail the RNP, and indeed (X \u2297Y )\u2217 6= X \u2217 \u2297Y \u2217 . However the proof is\nrather delicate, using specific properties of these spaces, and I'm inclined to believe there is no technique\ngeneral enough to give an affirmative answer to problem 4.\nThe next result summarizes consequences of the previous results in the context of Problem 2.\nTheorem 8. Let X be a given Banach space. Consider the following two properties\nP1 . Every integral operator on X \u2217 is nuclear.\nP2 . l1 does not embed in K(X).\n1. If P1 holds, l1 does not embed in X.\n2. If X \u2217 has the approximation property and X \u2217 or X \u2217\u2217 has the RNP, then P1 holds.\n3. If X \u2217 has the bounded approximation property and P2 holds, P1 holds.\n4. If X \u2217 has the bounded approximation property, then P2 holds if and only if for all separable\nsubspaces Z and Y of X \u2217 and X respectively such that Z \u2217 has the bounded approximation\nproperty, the cardinality of L(Z \u2217 , Y \u2217\u2217 ) is less than 2c (iff the cardinality equals c).\n1. This follows from Theorem 1, part 4, for if 1 is false, this implies there exists an integral operator\non X \u2217 which is not compact, hence not nuclear.\n2. This is Proposition 3.\n\u2228\n\n3. If X \u2217 has the bap, then K(X) = X \u2217 \u2297X (because X has the ap), and hence\n\u2227\n\nK(X)\u2217 = I(X \u2217 ) = X \u2217\u2217 \u2297X \u2217\nby Proposition 5, since the hypotheses imply that the integral, nuclear, and projective tensor norms are\nequivalent on X \u2217\u2217 \u2297 X \u2217 . Of course the final equality implies that P1 holds.\nTo show 4, we need\nLemma 9. If X \u2217 has the bap, then very separable subspace E of X is contained in a separable subspace\nZ of X such that Z \u2217 is isomorphic to a complemented subspace of X \u2217 .\nWe first complete the proof of Theorem 8, then prove Lemma 9.\n\u2228\n\n1. As in the proof of 3, K(X) = X \u2217 \u2297X and so the \"only if\" statement follows immediately from\nTheorem 6. To see \"if\", suppose to the contrary that l1 embeds in K(X). Then we can choose separable\n\u2228\n\nsubspaces E and Y of X and X \u2217 respectively such that l1 embeds in E \u2297Y . But if we choose Z satisfying\n\u2228\n\nthe conclusion of Lemma 9, then Z \u2217 has the bap, and then l1 does not embed in Z \u2297Y , by Theorem 6,\na contradiction.\n\u0003\nProof of Lemma 9. Since X \u2217 has the bap, so does X, and so we may choose 1 < \u03bb < \u221e so that for all\nfinite-dimensional subspaces F of X, there exists a finite rank operator T on X such that\n(60)\n\nkT k \u2264 \u03bb and T | F = I | F .\n\n\f16\n\nHASKELL P. ROSENTHAL\n\nLet e0 , e1 , e2 , . . . be an enumeration of a countable dense subset of E. Choose T1 a finite rank operator\non X satisfying (60), where F = [e0 , e1 ] and \"T \" = T1 . Suppose n \u2265 1 and finite rank operators T1 , Tn\nhave been chosen. Now let F = [Range Tn , [en+1 ]]. Choose Tn+1 satisfying (60) with \"T \" = Tn+1 .\nThis completes the inductive construction of the Tn 's; Let Fn = Tn (X) and Z = \u222aFj . Note that\nFn \u2282 Fn+1 and en \u2208 Fn for all n; hence E \u2282 Z. It follows that\n(61)\n\nTn (X) \u2282 Z for all n and Tn (z) \u2192 z in norm for all z \u2208 Z .\n\nNow the compactness of the unit ball of X \u2217 in the weak* topology implies that there exists a net\n(Tn\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208\u221e (i.e., a subnet of the sequence (Tj ) and an operator P on X \u2217 such that\nTn\u2217\u03b1 (x\u2217 ) \u2192 P (x\u2217 ) w\u2217 for all x\u2217 \u2208 X \u2217 .\n\n(62)\n\n(62) shows that kP k \u2264 \u03bb (so P is indeed bounded). Now if x\u2217 \u2208 Z \u2217 , then (61) implies that Tn\u2217 (x\u2217 ) = 0\nfor all n, which implies\nP (x\u2217 ) = 0 for all x\u2217 \u2208 Z + .\n\n(63)\n\nNow by our construction, Tn+1 | Range Tn = I | Range Tn for all n, which implies that for all k and\nn > k, Tn Tk = Tk , and so taking adjoints, Tk\u2217 Tn\u2217 = Tk\u2217 for all k and n > k. But then for x\u2217 \u2208 X \u2217 , we\ndeduce, thanks to the weak*-continuity of Tk\u2217 , that\nlim Tk\u2217 Tn\u2217\u03b1 (x\u2217 ) = Tk P (x\u2217 ) = Tk (x\u2217 ) .\n\n(64)\n\n\u03b1\n\nIn turn, (64) implies, after taking another limit, that P 2 = P ; hence P is a projection. Finally,\nif P (x\u2217 ) = 0, then x\u2217 \u2208 Z \u22a5 .\n\n(65)\n\nFor if not, we would find z \u2208 Z, hx\u2217 , zi 6= 0. But then\n(66)\n\nhP x\u2217 , zi = limhTn\u2217\u03b1 , x\u2217 , zi = limhx\u2217 , Tn\u03b1 zi = (x\u2217 , z) 6= 0 .\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u22a5\n\n\u2217\n\n(63) and (65) show that Z is the kernel of P . Thus it follows that P X \u2217 is isomorphic to X \u2217 /Z \u22a5 ,\nwhich of course is isometric to Z \u2217 .\n\u0003\nRemark. It is known that the conclusion of the Lemma holds without any approximation property\nassumptions, but we included a proof of our needed result for completeness. We only used the hypothesis\nof the Lemma to obtain that X has the bounded approximation property. With a little more care in\nthe proof, we may thus obtain the following result: If X has the \u03bb-bap and E is a separable subspace of\nX, there is a separable subspace Z of X with the \u03bb-bap, containing E, such that Z \u2217 is \u03bb-isomorphic to\na \u03bb-complemented subspace of X \u2217 .\nOf course Theorem 8 suggests a possible solution to Problem 2, namely that P1 and P2 are equivalent\nproperties, if X \u2217 has the bap.\nProblem 6. If X \u2217 has the bap, does P1 imply P2 ?\nOf course Problems 4 and 6 are linked, for an affirmative answer to Problem 4 implies an affirmative\nanswer to Problem 6.\nWe now give examples illustrating Theorem 6. The examples show that the conditions of Corollary 4\n\u2228\n\nare not necessary, to insure that l1 does not embed in X \u2297Y . The examples also show that there exist\nseparable Banach spaces X and Y not containing l1 isomorphically, so that there exists an integral\nnon-nuclear operator from X to Y \u2217 . The examples are natural generalizations of the James tree space\nJT . We first define these spaces and summarize some of their properties.\nLet D be the dyadic tree; that is, D is the set of all finite sequences of 0's and 1's, ordered by\nextension.

JT2 is the space defined as JT in [LS], discovered\nin [J3], and the proofs of the properties of JTp that we require are the same as those for JT . (For an\nalternate exposition, see [B].)\nLet us first note that\n(71)\n\ns\u2217 is a norm one functional on JTp for any segment s.\n\nWe refer to the functionals \u03b2 \u2217 , for \u03b2 a branch of D, as branch functionals. For W a non-empty subset\nof D, set\nf = [ej : \u03c4 (j) \u2208 W ] .\nW\n\n(72)\n\nThen it is obvious that for any segment s,\n(73)\n\n^\ns\u0303 is contractively complemented in JTp , with complement D\n\u223c s.\n\nLet us also note that given a branch \u03b2 of D, \u03b2 \u223c (\u03b5j )\u221e\nj=1 , then if we let \u03b2\u03b1 = e\u03c4 \u22121 (\u03b51 ,...,\u03b5n\u22121 ) , j = 1, . . .,\nthen\n(\u03b2j )\u221e\nj=1 is isometrically equivalent to the boundedly complete basis for J\n(74)\nwhere J denotes the quasi-reflexive order one space of James.\n\u2217\nIn particular, (\u03b2j )\u221e\nj=1 dominates the summing basis, and the branch functional \u03b2 restricted to \u03b2\u0303 is the\nsumming functional.\nWe denote by Dn the family of elements of D of length n; then letting \u03b1n1 , . . . , \u03b1n2n be an enumeration\nof Dn , and setting enj = e\u03c4 \u22121 (\u03b1nj ) for all j, we have that\n\n(75)\n\n^\nD\u0303n is contractively complemented in JTp , by \u223c\nDn ,\nn\n\nand (enj )2j=1 is isometrically equivalent to the lp2n basis.\nWe now summarize the rest of the properties of JTp that we shall need (some of which are decidedly\nnon-trivial). (Throughout, r\u2217 denotes the conjugate index to r, r1 + r1\u2217 = 1.)\nTheorem 10.\n1. (ej ) is a boundedly complete monotone basis for JTp .\n2. (JTp )\u2217 is the norm-closed linear space of the functionals (e\u2217j ) biorthogonal to (ej ), and the\nbranch functionals.\n3. The set of branch functionals B is homeomorphic to the Cantor set, in the weak*-topology.

Every normalized weakly null sequence in JTp has a subsequence equivalent to the lp -basis.\n(5. was established for JT in [AI]; see [B] for an alternate treatment of the proof of Theorem 10 for\nJT , which immediately generalizes to the case of JTp .)\nWe may draw some immediate consequences. First, since (JTp )\u2217 is thus canonically embedded in\nits double dual, JTp is canonically complemented in (JTp )\u2217 , by ((JTp )\u2217 )\u22a5 . Hence it follows from\nTheorem 10 part 4 that\nJTp\u2217\u2217 is isometric to JTp \u2295 lpc .\n\n(77)\n\nOf course JTp has the Radon-Nikodym property, being a separable dual. Then obviously by (77), JTp\u2217\u2217\nalso has the Radon-Nikodym property and the metric approximation property. So we deduce that\n(78)\n\n(JTp )\u2217 , JTp , (JTp )\u2217 , and JTp\u2217\u2217 all have the metric approximation property.\n\nOf course it also follows immediately that l1 does not embed in JTp\u2217\u2217 .\nWe may now formulate our final main result; which shows in particular that for 1 < p < \u221e,\n\u2228\n\nl1 embeds in JTp \u2297JTp iff 2 \u2264 p < \u221e .\n\n(79)\n\n\u2228\n\n(I am indebted to J.

Suppose first that p\u2217 \u2264 q. We show that 3 holds, which implies that 1 holds by Theorem 6. Let\n\u03bc be the \"Cantor probability measure\" on the Borel sets of B q , associated to the family of clopen sets\n(B\u03b1q )\u03b1\u2208D .

Suppose\nthat there are branches \u03b3 6= \u03b2 such that x\u2217 = \u03b3 \u2217 and y \u2217 = \u03b2 \u2217 , and choose k so that the branches split\n\u221e\nat level k; i.e., if \u03b3 = (\u03b3j )\u221e\nj=0 and \u03b2 = (\u03b2j )j=0 , then \u03b3k 6= \u03b2k , which implies that \u03b3n 6= \u03b2n for all n > k.\nBut then if n > k, there are unique i 6= j such that \u03b1ni \u2208 \u03b3, \u03b1nj \u2208 \u03b2, and hence\n\u03b3 \u2217 (enl )\u03b2 \u2217 (enl ) = 0 for all 1 \u2264 l \u2264 2n .\n\n(95)\n\nFinally, if x\u2217 = \u03b3 \u2217 = y \u2217 , then for each n, there is exactly one i with \u03b1ni \u2208 \u03b3, and then \u03b3 \u2217 (eni ) = 1,\nP2n\n\u03b3 \u2217 (enj ) = 0, j 6= i, and hence l=1 \u03b3 \u2217 (enl )\u03b3 \u2217 (enl ) = 1 for all n. (Actually, (An ) converges in the w\u2217\noperator topology on Lp,q to the operator S such that S(e\u2217j ) = 0 for all j, and S(\u03b3 \u2217 ) = \u03b3 \u2217\u2217 for all\nbranches \u03b3, where \u03b3 \u2217\u2217 (\u03b2 \u2217 ) = \u03b4\u03b3\u03b2 all \u03b2 and \u03b3 \u2217\u2217 (e\u2217j ) = 0 all j; (\u03b3 \u2217\u2217 )\u03b3\u2208B is in fact the basis for lqc in\n(JTq )\u2217\u2217 ).\nNow let F be the family of all finite non-empty subsets of B, directed by inclusion.

But also if \u03b3, \u03b2 are difference branches of B, then for n sufficiently large, the branches will have\n\u2217 mn\nn\nsplit at level mn , which implies that \u03b3 \u2217 (em\nij )\u03b2 (eij ) = 0 for all 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n. Finally, suppose \u03b3 is a\ngiven branch.

Then we have by (92), (100) and the fact that (94) holds for H = Gi ,\n\u2227\n\ni = 1, 2, that G satisfies (87) and (88), and so G \u22a5 JTp \u2297JTq , G(T ) = 1, whence T is not nuclear.\nNow suppose that q < p\u2217 . To show that 1 holds, we only need to show that JTp and JTq satisfy the\nassumptions of Corollary 7; but of course these spaces satisfy all the assumptions preceding the final\none, so we only need to prove that\n(104)\n\nEvery operator from (JTp )\u2217 to (JTq )\u2217\u2217 has separable range.\n\nLet P : (JTq )\u2217\u2217 be the projection from (JTq )\u2217\u2217 onto JTq , with kernel((JTq )\u2217 )\u22a5 , which we know by\nTheorem 10 is isometric to lqc ; for the sake of notational simplicity, let us just set ((JTq )\u2217 )\u22a5 = lqc . Now\nlet T : (JTp )\u2217 \u2192 (JTq )\u2217\u2217 be a given operator, and set\nA = P T and B = (I \u2212 P )T .\n\n(105)\n\nObviously A has separable range, and B is an operator from (JTp )\u2217 to lqc . We claim that\n(106)\n\nB is compact.\n\nIt suffices to prove that B \u2217 :\n\n\u2217\nlqc\n\n\u2192 (JTp )\u2217\u2217 is compact. To do that, we shall show that\n\nEvery normalized weakly null sequence in (JTp )\u2217\u2217\n\n(107)\n\nhas a subsequence equivalent to the lp basis.\n\u2217\n\nThis will complete the proof. Indeed, to show that B \u2217 is compact, it suffices (by reflexivity of lqc ) to\nshow that\n(108)\n\n\u2217\n\ngiven (xn ) a normalized weakly null sequence in lqc , then kB \u2217 (xn )k \u2192 0.\n\nSuppose this is not the case. But if (xn ) fails to satisfy (108), there exists a subsequence (x\u2032n ) such\n\u2217\nthat (x\u2032n ) is equivalent to the lq basis and by (107), B \u2217 (x\u2032n ) is equivalent to the lp basis. But our\n\u2217\n\u2217\nassumption q < p is the same as p < q \u2217 , and we have thus deduced that the lq basis dominates the lp\n\u2217\nbasis, a contradiction. Of course once we know that B and hence B, is compact, then B has separable\nrange, and thus T has separable range, finishing the proof.\nSince (JTp )\u2217\u2217 = JTp \u2295 lpc and so both factors have the desired property, by Theorem 8 part 5, (107)\nis easily seen, but for completeness, here's the argument. Let (xn ) be a normalized weakly null sequence\nin (JTp )\u2217\u2217 .\nWe may assume (by passing to a subsequence) that (xn ) is a basic sequence. Now if there is a\nsubsequence (x\u2032n ) of (xn ) such that kP x\u2032n k \u2192 0, we easily obtain a further subsequence (x\u2032\u2032n ) such that\n((I \u2212 P )x\u2032\u2032n ) is equivalent to (x\u2032\u2032n ), and hence by passing to a further subsequence (x\u2032\u2032n ) if necessary, that\np\n(x\u2032\u2032\u2032\nn ) is equivalent to the l basis. Thus we may now assume that\n(109)\n\nthere is a \u03b4 > 0 so that kP xn k \u2265 \u03b4 for all n.\n\nBut then by Theorem 10 part 5, we may choose a subsequence (x\u2032n ) of (xn ) so that\n(110)\n\n(P x\u2032n ) is equivalent to the lp -basis.\n\nNow if some subsequence (x\u2032\u2032n ) of (x\u2032n ) satisfies that k(I \u2212 P )x\u2032\u2032n k \u2192 0, then just as before, we get a\nsubsequence of (x\u2032n ) equivalent to the lp basis, so suppose this also is not the case. But then (after\ndropping a few terms if necessary), there is a \u03b4 \u2032 > 0 such that\n(111)\n\nk(I \u2212 P )x\u2032n k \u2265 \u03b4 \u2032 for all n ,\n\nand now by the standard property of the lp basis, there is a subsequence (x\u2032\u2032n ) such that also\n(112)\n\n((I \u2212 P )x\u2032\u2032n ) is equivalent to the l1 -basis.\n\nBut then also by (110),\n(113)\n\n(P x\u2032\u2032n ) is equivalent to the lp -basis.\n\nThe continuity of P and I \u2212P and (126),(127) now easily yield that (x\u2032\u2032n ) is equivalent to the lp basis. \u0003\n\n\f22\n\nHASKELL P. ROSENTHAL\n\nRemarks. 1. Going through the proofs of Theorems 6 and 11 is a difficult way to see that condition 4\nin the Remark (following the statement of Theorem 11) holds if 2 holds, for this may more easily be\nseen directly as follows. Since (JTp )\u2217 has the metric approximation property,\n\u2227\n\n\u2228\n\nJTp\u2217 \u2297JTq\u2217 is isometric to a closed linear subspace of I(JTp , JTq\u2217 ) = (JTp \u2297JTq )\u2217 ,\n\n(114)\nand thus\n\n\u2228\n\nLp,q is isometric to a quotient space of (JTp \u2297JTq )\u2217\u2217 ,\n\n(115)\n\n\u2217\n\n(where Lp,q is as in the above remark). Using Theorem 10 part 4 and (77), let Q : (JTp )\u2217 \u2192 lpc be a\nquotient map and j : lqc \u2192 (JTq )\u2217\u2217 be an isometric injection. Since p\u2217 \u2264 q, the l\u2217\u2217 -basis dominates the\n\u2217\nlq -basis. Then given \u03b7 \u2208 {0, 1}c, there exists a unique linear contraction T\u03b7 : lpc \u2192 l?c such that\n(116)\n\nfor all \u03b1 < c, (T\u03b7 )(\u03b1) = 1 if \u03b7(\u03b1) = 1, (T\u03b7 )(\u03b1) = 0 if \u03b7(\u03b1) = 0.\n\nNow defining T\u0303\u03b7 \u2208 Lp,q by\n(117)\n\nT\u0303\u03b7 = jT\u03b7 Q ,\n\nit follows that \u03b7 6= \u03b7 \u21d2 T\u0303\u03b7 6= T\u0303\u03b7\u2032 , proving that card Lp,q = 2c (and also showing directly that\n\u2228\n\n\u2228\n\n(JTp \u2297JTq )\u2217\u2217 has cardinality 2c by (115), thus giving that l1 embeds in JTp \u2297JTq by [OR].\n2. An inspection of the operator V constructed in the above proof shows that its range is actually\ncontained in (JTq )\u2217 , and thus condition 3. of Theorem 10 may be strengthened to\n3\u2032 . There exists an integral operator from JTp to (JTq ), which is not nuclear\n\u2227\n\n4. It's conceivable that (JT )\u2217 \u2297(JT )\u2217 (or more generally, (JTp )\u2217 \u2297 (JTp\u2217 )\u2217 for some 1 < p, q < \u221e,\n\u2217\n(p \u2264 q), is a counterexample to Problem 4. I reduced this to a separable issue, which, however, I cannot\n\u2227\n\ndecide. That is, I proved that if p, q are as above and L1 embeds in (JTp )\u2217 \u2297(Jq )\u2217 , then L1 embeds in\n\u2227\n\n(JTp )\u2217 \u2297(JTq )\u2217 . An alternate approach to Problem 3, using embeddings of unconditional families in\n\u2227\n\n\u2227\n\nplace of embeddings of L1 , does not work. In fact, it follows that Y = ((JT )\u2217 \u2297JT \u2217 )/(JT )\u2217 \u2297(JT )\u2217 ) is\n\u2227\n\nisometric to l2c \u2297l2c ; the space of \"diagonal\" operators in this space is isometric to l1c . Thus, Y contains a\n\u2227\n\nsubspace isometric to l1c , whence by the lifting property of this space, (JT )\u2217 \u2297(JT )\u2217 contains a subspace\nisometric to l1c . However (JT )\u2217 has no uncountable unconditional family by Theorem 1.\nWe conclude this section with an application of Theorem 8 to the relationship of Problem 1 with the\nRNP. We first need\nLemma 12. (JTq )\u2217 fails the RNP for all q, 1 < q < \u221e.\nProof. We shall show that (JTq )\u2217 has a \"\u03b4-tree.\" We first motivate the construction. Let \u03bc be the\nCantor measure on the Borel subsets of B and V : L1 (\u03bc) \u2192 (JTq )\u2217 be the operator constructed at the\nbeginning of the proof of Theorem 11. Then in fact V is valued in (JTq )\u2217 , and is not representable by a\nBochner integrable function. Rather than proving this, however, let us just examine: V (1). Since (e\u2217j )\nP\u221e\nis a w\u2217 -basis for (JTq )\u2217 , V (1) must have an expansion; V (1) = j=1 cj e\u2217j , the series converging in the\nw\u2217 -topology. The coefficients (cj ) are determined by: cj = hV (1), ej i for all j. Let us instead, label the\ncoefficient corresponding to ej as c\u03b1 , where j = \u03c4 (\u03b1). Then for any \u03b1 \u2208 D,\nZ\n1\n(118)\nhV 1, e\u03c4 (\u03b1) i =\nw\u2217 (e\u03c4 (\u03b1) ) d\u03bc(w) = |\u03b1| ,\n2\nB\nbecause w\u2217 (e\u03c4 (\u03b1) ) = 1 if w \u2208 B\u03b1 and 0 otherwise.\nBut we have that\nX 1\n(119)\nconverges in norm.\ne\u2217\n|\u03b1| \u03c4 (\u03b1)\n2\n\u03b1\u2208D\n\n\fSOME NEW CHARACTERIZATIONS OF BANACH SPACES CONTAINING l1\n\n23\n\nIndeed, let yn be defined by\nn\n\n2\nX\n1 n \u2217\n1 X \u2217\ne\u03c4 (\u03b1) .\n(e\n)\n=\nyn =\nj\n2n\n2n\nj=1\n\n(120)\n\n|\u03b1|=n\n\nThen\nkyn k =\n\n(121)\n\n1\n2n/q\u2217\n\nby (75).\n\nThus\n\u221e\nX\n\n(122)\n\nn=0\n\nkyn k =\n\n\u2217\n\n1\n1\u2212\n\nP\u221e\nP\n1\ne\u2217q(\u03b1) .\nand of course n=0 yn = \u03b1\u2208\u221e 2|\u03b1|\nIt is then easily verified that for any \u03b1,\n\n1\n2n/q\u2217\n\nT (\u03c7B\u03b1 ) =\n\n(123)\n\n2n/q\ndef\n= n/q\u2217\n= cq < \u221e ,\n2\n\u22121\n\nX 1\ne\u2217\n|\u03b1| \u03c4 (\u03b1)\n\n\u03b3\u2208B\u03b1\n\nand this series converges in norm, by exactly the same reason we gave for (119).\nNow define (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208D by\nX 1\ne\u2217 = T (2|\u03b1| \u03c7B\u03b1 .\n(124)\nt\u03b1 = 2|\u03b1|\n|\u03b1| \u03c4 (\u03b3)\n2\n\u03b3\u2208B\n\u03b1\n\nSince\n(125)\n\n[e\u2217\u03c4 (\u03b3)\n\n: \u03b3 \u2208 B\u03b1 ] is canonically isometric to (JTq )\u2217 , we thus have that\nkt\u03b1 k \u2264 cq for all \u03b1 .\n\nIt follows by (124) and the linearity of T (or by direct computation) that for all \u03b1 \u2208 D,\n1\n(126)\nt\u03b1 = (t\u03b10 + t\u03b11 )\n2\nand\n(127)\n\n\u2217\n\nkt\u03b10 \u2212 t\u03b11 k \u2265 ke\u2217\u03b10 \u2212 e\u2217\u03b11 k = 21/q .\n\u2217\n\nThus (t\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208D is a bounded \"\u03b4-tree\" with \u03b4 = 21/q , and so (JTq )\u2217 fails the RNP (cf.

Suppose that Z is a L\u221e space which is isomorphic to a quotient of a subspace of a\nBanach space X.

Then\na compactness argument, using the fact that \u03bb Ba Z \u2217 is w\u2217 -compact, shows there is a linear operator\nS : Z \u2217 \u2192 W \u2217 so that\n(132)\n\nkSk \u2264 \u03bb and for all z \u2208 Z and z \u2217 \u2208 Z \u2217 , hSz \u2217 , zi = hz \u2217 , zi .\n\nThus if R : W \u2217 \u2192 Z \u2217 denotes the canonical restriction map, we have by (132) that\nRS = IZ \u2217 .\n\n(133)\n\u2217\n\nThen setting Y = S(Z ), Y is \u03bb-isomorphic to Z \u2217 , since (133) gives that S is an isomorphism with the\ninverse of S : Z \u2217 \u2192 Y given by R|Y . Moreover,\n(134)\n\nGiven \u03b5 > 0 and y \u2208 Y , there exists a z \u2208 Z with kzk = 1\nsuch that |y(z)| > \u03bb1 kyk \u2212 \u03b5.\n\n(It also follows from (133) that Y is complemented in Z \u2217 , by Z \u22a5 , but we don't use this.)\nNow (134) implies that\n(135)\n\nT\u0303 \u2217 | Y is an isomorphism, with T\u0303 (Y ) being \u03bbk(T \u2217 )\u22121 k-isomorphic to Z \u2217 .\n\nIndeed, given y \u2208 Y and \u03b5 > 0, choose z \u2208 Z satisfying (134), then choose x \u2208 X\u0303 with kxk \u2264 k(T \u2217 )\u22121 k+\u03b5\nso that T x = z. Thus letting \u03c4 = k(T \u22171)\u22121 k + \u03b5,\nk(T\u0303 \u2217 )(y)k = \u03c4 |hT\u0303 \u2217 y, xi|\n= \u03c4 |hy, T\u0303 xi| = \u03c4 |hy, T xi|\n(136)\n\nSince \u03b5 > 0 was arbitrary, (135) is proved.\n\n= \u03c4 |hy, zi|\n\u03c4\n\u2265 kyk \u2212 \u03b5 .\n\u03bb\n\u0003\n\n\fSOME NEW CHARACTERIZATIONS OF BANACH SPACES CONTAINING l1\n\n25\n\nRemark. We have kept track of the constants in the above proof because it then yields the following\nresult: Suppose X and Z are Banach spaces so that Z is an \"L1 -predual,\" meaning that Z \u2217 is isometric\nto L1 (\u03bc) for some (not necessarily \u03c3-finite) measure \u03bc, and suppose for all \u03b5 > 0, there exists a subspace\nX\u0303 of X so that Z is 1+\u03b5-isomorphic to a quotient space of X\u0303. Then Z \u2217 is 1+\u03b5-isomorphic to a subspace\nof X \u2217 for all \u03b5 > 0.\nIndeed, we need only apply our proof, using the standard fact (as follows from local reflexivity) that\nZ is an L\u221e,\u03bb space for all \u03bb > 1. Now assuming l1 embeds in X, then by a result of James [J1], given\n\u03b5 > 0, there is a subspace X\u0303 of X which (1 + \u03b5)-isomorphic to l1 , and consequently C([0, 1]) is (1 + \u03b5)isomorphic to a quotient space of X\u0303. Hence we deduce that for all \u03b5 > 0, (C(\u039b))\u2217 is (1 + \u03b5)-isomorphic\nto a subspace of X \u2217 .\nAs we show in Proposition 17, James' result that l1 is not distortable, holds for the spaces l1\u03ba as well,\n\u03ba an infinite cardinal. We thus obtain the following generalization of the above quantitative version of\n(8).\nTheorem 15. Let \u03ba be an infinite cardinal number, and suppose X contains a subspace isomorphic\nto l1\u03ba . Then given Z an L1 predual of density character at most \u03ba, X \u2217 contains a subspace (1 + \u03b5)isomorphic to Z \u2217 for all \u03b5 > 0.\nThe following result, which reduces to Pelczy\u0144ski's theorem for \u03ba = \u05d00 , is an immediate consequence.\nCorollary 16. Let \u03ba be an infinite cardinal number and suppose X contains a subspace isomorphic to\nl1\u03ba . Then for all \u03b5 > 0, X \u2217 contains a subspace (1 + \u03b5)-isomorphic to [C({0, 1}\u03ba )]\u2217 .\n\u0003\nFinally, we give the extension of James' theorem to the spaces l1\u03ba (which is apparently a new result).\nProposition 17. Let \u03ba be an infinite cardinal number, and assume X contains a subspace isomorphic\nto l1\u03ba . Then X contains a subspace (1 + \u03b5)-isomorphic to l1\u03ba for all \u03b5 > 0.\nProof. We identify cardinals with initial ordinals. Let then [e\u03b1 )\u03b1<\u03ba be a normalized basis of cardinality\n\u03ba in X, equivalent to the l1\u03ba basis. For each cardinal \u03b1 < \u03ba, define \u03b4\u03b1 by\n\uf8f1\nX\n\uf8f4\n\u03b4\u03b1 = sup{\u03b4 > 0 : k\nc\u03b3 e\u03b3 k \u2265 \u03b4 for\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\u03b3\u2265\u03b1\nX\n(137)\n\uf8f4\n|c\u03b3 | = 1}\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3all families of scalars (c\u03b3 )\u03b3\u2265\u03b1 such that\n\u03b3\u2265\u03b1\n\nIt is obvious that \u03b1 \u2192 \u03b4\u03b1 is an increasing function. Hence\n(138)\n\ndef\n\nlim \u03b4\u03b1 = \u03b4 exists.\n\n\u03b1\u2192\u03ba\n\n(Of course if \u03ba is of uncountable cofinality, then \u03b4\u03b1 = \u03b4 for all \u03b1 sufficiently large; however this fact is\nirrelevant for the proof.)\nNow let 0 < \u03b7 < \u03b4 be given. It follows easily by induction and the fact that the family of all finite\nsubsets of \u03ba also has cardinality \u03ba, and also because card \u03b3 < \u03ba for \u03b3 < \u03ba and hence card{\u03b1 : \u03b3 \u2264 \u03b1 <\n\u03ba} = \u03ba for all \u03b3 < \u03ba}, that we may choose a family (f\u03b1 )\u03b1<\u03ba of finite linear combinations of the e\u03b1 's\nsuch that for each \u03b1, there exist ordinals \u03b1 \u2264 a\u03b1 \u2264 b\u03b1 and c\u03b3 's, only finitely many non-zero, with\nX\nf\u03b1 =\n(153i)\nc\u03b3 e \u03b3\na\u03b1 \u2264\u03b3\u2264b\u03b1\n\n(153ii)\n\nkf\u03b1 k = 1 and\n\nX\n\na\u03b1 \u2264\u03b3\u2264b\u03b1\n\n(153iii)\n(153iv)\n\n|c\u03b3 | >\n\n1\n\u03b40 + \u03b7\n\n\u03b4\u03b10 > \u03b4 \u2212 \u03b7\nfor all \u03b1 < \u03b1\u2032 < \u03ba ,\n\nb\u03b1 < a\u2032\u03b1 .\n\n\f26\n\nHASKELL P.
