These observations demonstrate that\ngravity can have a significant effect on cavitation bubbles. An analysis of the gravity-induced jets,\ndetailed in Ref. [1], uncovers a scaling law between the size of bubble-induced jets and the nondimensional parameter \u03b6 \u2261 |\u2207p|R0 /\u2206p, where R0 is the maximal bubble radius and \u2206p is the\ndriving pressure. This scaling law applies to any jet formed in any uniform pressure gradient.\n\nJets produced by collapsing cavitation bubbles play a\nkey role in modern technologies [2] and erosion [3]. This\npaper contributes to the study of such jets through precise visualizations and universal results of jets formed by\nbubbles collapsing in different gravitation fields.\nOur study relies on an experiment producing the most\nspherical cavitation bubbles today. The bubbles grow inside a liquid from a point-plasma generated by a nanosecond laser pulse. Unlike in previous studies, the laser is\nfocussed by a parabolic mirror, resulting in a plasma of\nunprecedented symmetry. The arising bubbles are sufficiently spherical that the hydrostatic pressure gradient caused by gravity becomes the dominant source of\nasymmetry in the collapse and rebound of the cavitation\nbubbles. To avoid this natural source of asymmetry, the\nwhole experiment is therefore performed in micro-gravity\nconditions (ESA, 52nd parabolic flight campaign).\n\ngravitational fields. A single frame from this video is\nrepresented in Fig. 1 and shows the three bubbles during\ntheir rebound phase. This figure demonstrates jet formation in the weak uniform pressure gradient of gravity.\nWe systematically analyzed the jets of collapsing\nspherical bubbles, while varying four experimental parameters: the gravitational acceleration a (0g\u22121.8g), the\nmaximal bubble radius R0 (1 \u2212 7 mm), the mean driving\npressure \u2206p (8 \u2212 80 kPa) defined as the difference between the mean static pressure p and the vapor pressure\npv , and the viscosity \u03b7 (1\u221230 mPa s). The latter was varied by choosing specific water-glycerine mixtures for the\nliquid. A statistical analysis of the data unveiled a proportionality relation between the normalized jet volume\nof the cavitation bubbles in a uniform pressure gradient\nand the non-dimensional parameter (plots in Ref.

By\nsystematically analyzing and modelling these jets, we uncovered a universal scaling law, which establishes a general link between a non-dimensional parameter \u03b6 and the\njet volume produced by spherical bubbles collapsing in a\nuniform pressure gradient \u2207p. Since such a uniform gradient is the linear term in the Taylor expansion of any\nsmooth pressure field, our result extends, to first order,\nto bubbles in any other pressure field.\nSupported by the European Space Agency ESA and\nthe Swiss NSF (200020-116641, PBELP2-130895).\n\nfrom laser-induced cavitation bubbles, Appl.
