INTRODUCTION\n\nAs accreted H/He-rich matter accumulates on the\nsurface of a neutron star (NS), it is compressed and\nheated, occasionally leading to violent thermonuclear\nburning, a phenomenon known as type I X-ray bursts.\nSuch bursts were discovered during the mid-1970s\n(Grindlay et al. 1976; Belian et al. 1976), and many\ntheoretical studies have been made to investigate their\ndetailed properties (e.g., Joss 1977; Lamb & Lamb\n1978; Narayan & Heyl 2003; Woosley et al. 2004;\nCooper & Narayan 2006). For reviews, see Lewin et al.\n(1993), Cumming (2004), and Strohmayer & Bildsten\n(2006). Recently, Galloway et al. (2008) presented a\nlarge sample of bursts (1187 in total) observed by\nRXTE over a time interval of more than ten years.\nThe bursts typically rise very rapidly (<2 s), followed\nby a slower exponential decay (\u223c10 s to several minutes).\nThe burst spectra can be fit with a single blackbody (BB)\n(Swank et al. 1977; Hoffman et al. 1977; Galloway et al.\n2008). Burst properties do depend on the mass accretion rate (\u1e41) and the composition of the accreted matter (See Table 1 by Galloway et al. (2008) and references\ntherein and above). Roughly, for solar metallicities, the\nbursts mostly burn helium and have a fast rise when\n\u1e41 is about 1\u201310% of the Eddington limit (\u1e41Edd ). At\nhigher or lower \u1e41, they burn mixed hydrogen and helium and have a slower rise and decay. If the accreted\nmatter is dominated by helium, the bursts mostly burn\nhelium, and their properties vary little with the accretion\nrate. The accreted matter is expected to burn stably at\n\u1e41 close to or above \u1e41Edd (although bursts are seen in\nsome Z sources, see below). In bright bursts, the photospheric layer can be lifted off the NS surface by radiation\n1 MIT Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research,\nMIT, 70 Vassar Street, Cambridge, MA 02139-4307; lindc@mit.edu\n2 Astronomical Institute, \"Anton Pannekoek\", University of Amsterdam, and Center for High Energy Astrophysics, Kruislaan 403,\n1098 SJ Amsterdam, The Netherlands.\n3 INAF \u2013 Osservatorio Astronomico di Brera, Via E. Bianchi 46,\nI-23807, Merate (LC), Italy\n\npressure when the local X-ray luminosity reaches the Eddington limit. Under certain assumptions, these bursts\ncan then be used as distance estimators (Basinska et al.\n1984; Kuulkers et al. 2003; Galloway et al. 2003).\nBursts are only found in weakly magnetized NS\nX-ray binaries, which mainly consist of two classes,\ni.e., atoll and Z sources (Hasinger & van der Klis 1989;\nvan der Klis 2006). They have different luminosity, spectral and timing properties, etc. Atoll sources have \u1e41\ntypically < 0.5\u1e41Edd and can have hard and soft states in\naddition to transition between them. In the hard state, a\nsignificant fraction of the energy is emitted above 20 keV\nand is normally accompanied by radio jets (e.g., Fender\n2006; Migliari & Fender 2006). The source in the soft\nstate has relatively much weaker emission above 20 keV\nand is believed to be dominated by emission from the accretion disk and the boundary layer where the accreted\nmatter impacts the NS surface. Bursts are very often\nseen in atoll sources and have been observed in any of\nthe above X-ray states (e.g., Galloway et al. 2008).\nZ sources include six classical objects Sco X-1, GX\n17+2, GX 349+2, Cyg X-2, GX 340+0, and GX 5-1\n(Hasinger & van der Klis 1989), with \u1e41 close to or above\n\u1e41Edd . In the color-color diagram, Z sources can trace\nout a 'Z' pattern, whose branches are called horizontal,\nnormal and flaring branches (HB/NB/FB), respectively.\nThe Z pattern can move in the diagram, most obviously\nin the case of Cyg X-2. Although the spectra in Z sources\nare all soft and dominated by the emission from the accretion disk and boundary layer, these branches are different from each other in spectral and timing properties and\nevolution timescales. Only GX 17+2 has exhibited type\nI X-ray bursts, and no bursts have been reported to be\nin the FB (Kahn & Grindlay 1984; Tawara et al. 1984;\nSztajno et al. 1986; Kuulkers et al. 2002). There are\nburst events in Cyg X-2, but their thermonuclear origin\nis still inconclusive (Kuulkers et al. 1995; Wijnands et al.\n1997; Galloway et al. 2008).\nIn this letter, we report an analysis of X-ray bursts\nfrom the NS X-ray binary XTE J1701-462 during its\n\n\f2\n\nLin et al.\n\nFig. 2.- The color-color and hardness-intensity diagrams for\nobservations between MJD 54260 and 54315 in the decay of the\n2006-2007 outburst of XTE J1701-462. Blue filled circles for atollsource hard state, purple hexagrams for atoll-source soft state, red\ncrosses for Z-source flaring branch and black diamonds for the normal/flaring branch vertex. The circled points mark the location of\nthe bursts. The data binsize is 960 s, but longer for observations\nin the atoll-source soft and hard states (see text).\nFig. 1.- The one-day ASM light curve (upper panel) and 32-s\nPCA light curve (lower panel). The three prominences in the decay\nof the PCA light curve are type I X-ray bursts, where 1-s data are\nused.\n\n2006-2007 outburst. XTE J1701-462 is a unique source in\nthat it is the first NS transient that shows Z-source characteristics (Homan et al. 2007b; Lin et al. 2009). During\nthe decay of the outburst, the source changed from the\ntypical Z-source behavior to the typical atoll-source behavior (Lin et al. 2009; Homan et al. 2009). The analyses of comprehensive pointed observations of this outburst by RXTE have improved our understanding of atoll\nand Z sources and the physical processes associated with\nthe three Z-source branches. For example, the spectral\nanalysis in Lin et al. (2009) showed that the evolution\nfrom the Z to atoll sources and the movement of the\n'Z' tracks for Z sources in the color-color diagram result from the change in \u1e41. The three Z-source branches\nwere also suggested to represent three distinct physical\nmechanisms presumably operating at constant \u1e41. Our\nanalysis of its bursts is another part of our campaign to\nunderstand this source.\nPreliminary results of the bursts from XTE J1701-462\nhave been given in Homan et al. (2007a,c) and Lin et al.\n(2007). In \u00a72, we first carry out a systematic search of\nthe RXTE archive for bursts from this source. We then\npresent the spectral fit results of the bursts and estimate\nthe distance of this source in \u00a73. We describe our search\nfor burst oscillations in \u00a74. Finally we discuss our results\nand summarize our conclusions in \u00a75.\n2. OBSERVATIONS AND BURST SEARCH\n\nWe carried out a systematic search for bursts from\nXTE J1701-462 during its 2006-2007 outburst. We\nused all 866 pointed observations (\u223c3 Ms) of XTE\nJ1701-462 made with the Proportional Counter Array\n(PCA; Jahoda et al. 1996) on board RXTE. We used\nthe same scheme as that used by Remillard et al.\n(2006), which is briefly described as follows. PCA 1-s\nlight curves were created for each observation from\n\"standard1\" data mode, which integrates over the full\nenergy range of the instrument (effectively 2\u201340 keV).\nFor a time bin t, with intensity C(t), we computed\nthe mean b1 and the sample standard deviation \u03c31\n\nFig. 3.- The hardness-intensity diagram for observations 93703\u2013\n01\u201301\u201301 and 93703\u201301\u201301\u201308 using 32 s data. Black diamonds\nare for the Z-source normal/flaring branch vertex and are all from\nobservation 93703\u201301\u201301\u201308, and red crosses for Z-source flaring\nbranch and all from observation 93703\u201301\u201301\u201301. The two data\npoints in the triangles are from the interval containing the bursts.\nWe connect the time-series data points with solid lines to show\nthe source evolution. The one\u2013\u03c3 error bars for the hard color and\nintensity are also shown, with grey lines.\n\nusing 1-s data in a \"background\" interval t \u2212 280 to\nt \u2212 20 and corresponding values (b2 and \u03c32 ) in another\n\"background\" interval t + 180 to t + 280 after it. Then\nwe tested the joint condition [C(t) \u2212 b1 ] > 5\u03c31 and\n[C(t) \u2212 b2 ] > 5\u03c32 . If this condition is satisfied for three\nsequential data points (at t \u2212 1, t and t + 1), then we\nclaim to find a burst candidate at t. Candidates are\nrejected if they are due to detector breakdowns; see\nhttp://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xte/recipes/pca breakdown.html\nfor more information.\nUsing the above scheme we find three burst candidates.\nThey are on 2007 July 17, 20, and 25, during observations\n93703\u201301\u201301\u201301, 93703\u201301\u201302\u201300, and 93703\u201301\u201302\u201308.\nWe number them I, II, and III, respectively (see Table 1\nfor details).

The soft color and hard color are the count rate\nratios in the (3.6\u20135.0)/(2.2\u20133.6) keV bands and the (8.6\u2013\n18.0)/(5.0\u20138.6) keV bands, respectively. Each data point\nhas an integration time \u223c960 s for observations before\nMJD 54304, but corresponds to an entire observation for\nlater observations, which show little spectral variability.\nSeveral observations are further combined when intensity\nis <30 counts s\u22121 PCU\u22121 . The figure is symbol-coded:\nblue filled circles for atoll-source hard state, purple hexagrams for atoll-source soft state, red crosses for Z-source\nFB and black diamonds for the transition between the\nZ-source NB and the FB (NB/FB vertex). The classification of the states/branches is from Lin et al. (2009).\nDuring the time interval for data shown in Figure 2,\nthe source is not observed to enter the Z-source NB or\nHB. The FB in this interval shows the same spectral\nevolution and timing properties as the FB at higher luminosity when all Z-source branches observed (Lin et al.\n2009; Homan et al. 2009). Given the shape of the color\ntrack shown in Figure 2 and in view of the low persistent\nluminosity (\u223c10% of LEdd , see below), one could also\nclassify the FB in Figure 2 as the atoll-source upper banana branch. The evolution of the color tracks shown\nin Lin et al. (2009) and Homan et al. (2009) suggests\nthat the atoll-source upper banana branch and the Zsource FB as defined by Hasinger & van der Klis (1989)\ndescribe a similar phenomenon, albeit at different luminosities. In this paper, we will follow the state/branch\nclassification scheme by Lin et al. (2009), in which the\nZ-source FB phenomenon can be observed down to luminosities typically associated with atoll sources.\nIn Figure 2, we circle the data points where the bursts\nare detected. Burst I is in the FB, burst II in the NB/FB\nvertex, and burst III in the atoll-source soft state. The\n\npersistent emission stays roughly constant for the observations when bursts II and III are observed, and the occurences of the bursts seem not to modify the persistent\nemission. We examine the same question in greater detail\nfor the observation containing burst I (Obs 93703\u201301\u201301\u2013\n01), since this is the first occurence of a burst from a Z\nsource while it is in the FB. In order to see whether the\npersistent emission is modified by the burst, especially\nto see whether the source jumps to the NB/FB vertex\nright after the burst, we show in Figure 3 the hardnessintensity diagram for this observation (red crosses). Results for the next adjecent observation (Obs ID 93703\u2013\n01\u201301\u201308; about one day later), when the source is in\nthe NB/FB vertex, are also shown (black diamonds) for\ncomparison. Data points with 32 s bin size are used.\nThe two data points in the triangles are from the interval containing burst I. The data points are connected by\nblack solid lines in time to show the source evolution.\nWe clearly see that the source stays roughly at the same\nposition in this diagram before and after the burst. From\nthis we conclude that this burst does not interfere with\nthe persistent emission in the FB either. Ramifications\nfor this result are considered in \u00a75.\nThe count rate, soft color, hard color, and flux of the\npersistent emission are given in Table 1. The flux is estimated using a model of a multi-color disk plus a singletemperature blackbody (BB) (Lin et al. 2009), with both\n2.5\u201325 keV and bolometric values given (unabsorbed).\nThe bolometric flux is obtained analytically as our model\nconsists of two thermal components. The conversion of\nflux to luminosity is complicated by uncertainties in several important parameters, such as the source distance,\nthe disk inclination and the occultation factor of the BB,\nand is therefore not carried out here. Instead, we give\nin Table 1 the dimensionless flux (\u03b3; van Paradijs et al.\n1988), i.e., the ratio of the bolometric persistent flux to\nthe Eddington flux inferred from the radius expansion\nbursts (see below). Based on this parameter, the \u1e41 when\nthe bursts are detected is roughly 10% of \u1e41Edd .\n\n\f4\n\nLin et al.\n3. BURST SPECTRAL FITS\n\nWe used a standard procedure to do spectral fits of\nthe three bursts: create time-resolved spectra, use the\npersistent emission around the burst as background, and\nfit the spectra with a BB model (e.g., Galloway et al.\n2008). We used a 15-s interval that ended 35 s before\nthe burst to define the persistent emission. Event mode\ndata with 64 channels and 125-\u03bcs time resolution were\nused. Only PCUs 0 and 2 were on during the observations in which the above three bursts were detected.\nConsidering that the spectral calibration of PCU 0 has\nbeen bad at energies lower than 10 keV since the loss of\nthe propane layer in 2000, we only used data from PCU\n2. We note that Lin et al. (2007) used data from both\nPCUs. The peak count rates of these bursts are quite\nhigh (\u223c3500 counts/s/PCU), but by comparing with the\ncount rates from \"standard1\" mode data, we found no\ntelemetry saturation in the event mode data. The integration time of the spectra was set to be 0.5 s around\nthe peak and increased as the count rate decreased to\nmaintain sufficient statistics to constrain the spectral parameters. An energy range of 3.5\u201320 keV was used, and\n0.8% systematic errors were applied. Deadtime corrections, which were as large as 5%, were also made as suggested by RXTE team. The response files were created\nusing HEAsoft version 6.4. A hydrogen column density\nNH = 2.0 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 was assumed; it was inferred from\nspectral fitting of the persistent emission using simultaneous observations of RXTE and swift/XRT (Lin et al.\n2009), and is consistent with the value inferred from fitting of quiescence spectra (Fridriksson et al. 2009).\nThe results of our spectral fits are shown in Figure 4.\nThere are five panels for each burst (all with persistent emission background subtracted); PCA intensity,\nbolometric luminosity, BB temperature kTBB , BB radius\nRBB , and reduced \u03c72 are all shown versus time. The luminosity and radius were calculated at a distance of 8.8\nkpc (see below). The low values of reduced \u03c72 suggest\nthat the net burst spectra are well fit by a BB. The fast\nrise and slow cooling decay confirm that these bursts are\nbona fide type I X-ray bursts.\nThe most important feature that Figure 4 shows is that\nthe two brightest bursts (II and III) show photospheric\nradius expansion, as indicated by the anti-correlation between the temperature and radius when the luminosity\nreaches its peak: the temperature decreases from \u223c2.5\nkeV to \u223c1.8 keV while the radius increases from \u223c10 km\nto \u223c20 km. Radius expansion bursts are also often studied in terms of the BB luminosity versus the temperature,\nas shown in Figure 5. In this figure, the arrows indicate\nthe direction of the temporal evolution. As shown in the\npanels for bursts II and III, the source tends to evolve\nalong a horizontal line (constant luminosity) during the\nradius expansion/contraction phase but along a (dashed)\ndiagonal line (constant radius) during the cooling decay\nphase.\nWe use these radius expansion bursts to estimate the\ndistance to XTE J1701-462. The peak flux in bursts\nII and III are given in Table 1 with an average value\nof 41.1\u00b10.8 \u00d7 10\u22129 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 . Using the empirically determined Eddington luminosity 3.79 \u00b1 0.15 \u00d7 1038\nerg s\u22121 for bursts showing photospheric radius expansion\n(Kuulkers et al. 2003, with uncertainty 15%), we derive\n\na distance of 8.8 kpc. Using a theoretical expression for\nthe Eddington limit (see equation 8 in Galloway et al.\n(2008)) and assuming a 1.4 solar-mass NS with a radius\nof 10 km, we obtain a distance of 7.3\u00b10.1 kpc for Hpoor case (H-fraction X = 0) and 5.6\u00b10.1 kpc for H-rich\ncase (X = 0.7). We assumed that the peak luminosity is\nreached when the photosphere has settled back on the NS\nsurface (Galloway et al. 2008), which is roughly true in\nthis case (Figure 4). Hereafter, we use the value derived\nby the empirical method, i.e., 8.8 kpc.\nThe other properties of the bursts are listed in Table 1. The start time was defined to be the time when\nthe burst flux first exceeded 25% of the peak flux, and\nthe rise time is the interval that it takes for the burst\nflux to increase from 25% to 90% of the peak value\n(Galloway et al. 2008). We see that all three bursts rise\nvery rapidly, i.e., within \u223c1 s. Such bursts are probably\ndue to Helium burning, which is consistent with the \u1e41\n(\u223c10% of \u1e41Edd ) during these bursts (\u00a71). The bursts\nshow exponential decays but cannot be fit with a single\nexponential curve. Thus, as in Galloway et al. (2008), we\ndivide the decay (using the bolometric flux curve) into\ntwo parts and fit each with an exponential curve with\nindependent decay constants \u03c41 and \u03c42 . These bursts\ndecay rapidly, on time scales of several seconds. The fluence in Table 1 is estimated by summing the fluxes over\nthe burst and integrating the final exponential curve to\naccount for the additional flux beyond the data window.\nThe characteristic time scale \u03c4 is the fluence divided by\nthe peak flux. It is \u223c6 s for all bursts.\nAs the bursts decay, the radius tends to remain at an\nasymptotic value, as also shown in Figure 5, and this is a\nsignal of unstable nuclear burning in the bursts spreading over the whole NS surface (Lewin et al. 1993). We\ncalculate the asymptotic radius in the burst tails using\ndata when the burst flux decays from 80% to 20% of the\npeak value. The asymtotic radius for each burst is also\nlisted in Table 1 with an average of 8\u00b11 km at a distance\nof 8.8 kpc (corresponding to the dashed line in Figure 5).\nWe note that there is a slight increase in emission area\nin burst III as the decay progresses, as can be seen in\nFigure 5, the cause of which is unknown. The effects of\nredshift and spectral hardening should be corrected for\nin order to obtain the actual size of the NS (Lewin et al.\n1993). If a 1.4 solar-mass NS and a hardening factor of\n1.4 (e.g. Madej et al. 2004) are assumed, then the actual\nsize of the NS is \u223c 13 km.\n4. BURST OSCILLATION SEARCH\n\nWe searched each burst for coherent pulsations in the\nfrequency range 30 to 4000 Hz using Fourier techniques.\nWe computed power spectra throughout each burst using\nsliding 1, 2, 3 and 4-s windows with a step of 0.125 s.\nThe investigated energy bands were 2\u201360, 2\u201310, and 10\u2013\n30 keV. We found no significant signal. To estimate the\nupper limits, we used the set of Leahy-normalized power\nspectra (Leahy et al. 1983) with a 1-s window so as to\ntake into account possible frequency drifts.\nThe upper limit for each burst was then determined as\nfollows (see also Vaughan et al. 1994): (1) we searched\nfor the largest observed power Pmax in the 2\u201360 keV\nband; (2) we fit the noise powers of the power spectrum\nin which we found Pmax with a constant plus power law\nmodel; (3) we divided by the continuum model and mul-\n\n\f5\n\nFig. 4.- The results of the spectral fits of time-resolved spectra of the three bursts detected from XTE J1701-462 during its 2006-2007\noutburst.

The dashed lines\ncorrespond to RBB = 8 km.\n\ntiplied by 2 to re-normalize the power spectrum (see, e.g.,\nIsrael & Stella 1996; Watts & Strohmayer 2006) and (4)\nwe estimated the upper limits at a 99% confidence level\nusing the Groth distribution (Groth 1975; Vaughan et al.\n1994). The pulsed fraction upper limits are listed in Table 1. They are relatively high and not very constraining,\ncompared with the typically observed amplitudes of oscillations of a few ten percent (Strohmayer & Bildsten\n2006).\n5. DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe find three type I X-ray bursts from the 866\nRXTE pointed observations (\u223c3 Ms) of the NS transient\nXTE J1701-462 during its 2006-2007 outburst. These\nbursts are detected during the decay of the outburst. The\npersistent emission of the observations containing these\nthree bursts is weak, with fluxes \u223c 10% of the Eddington\nlimit. Based on the source state/branch classifications\nby Lin et al. (2009), the first burst is detected in the Zsource flaring branch; the second in the flaring/normal\nbranch vertex; and the third in the atoll-source soft state.\nDetailed spectral fits confirm these bursts as type I\nX-ray bursts. The last two of the three bursts show\n\nstrong photospheric radius expansion with a peak flux of\n41.1\u00b10.8 \u00d7 10\u22129 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 . Assuming an Eddington\nluminosity of 3.79 \u00b1 0.15 \u00d7 1038 erg s\u22121 (Kuulkers et al.\n2003), we estimate a distance of 8.8 kpc for XTE J1701462 with 15% systematic uncertainty. We find no significant burst oscillations between 30\u20134000 Hz.\nThe distance to XTE J1701-462 was initially estimated\nby Homan et al. (2007b). They gave a distance of 14.7\u00b13\nkpc by comparing the flux in the NB/FB vertex in a Scolike Z-source interval with that of Sco X-1 (which has a\ndistance of 2.8 \u00b1 0.3 kpc, as determined by radio parallax\nmeasurements). This value is higher than that derived\nhere using radius expansion bursts. A possible explanation for such a discrepancy is a difference in the inclination of these two systems. The orbital inclination of Sco\nX-1 is \u223c40\u25e6 (Fomalont et al. 2001; Steeghs & Casares\n2002). The above discrepancy can be explained if XTE\nJ1701-462 has orbital inclination of 70\u25e6 , as roughly estimated by Lin et al. (2009) based on the weak iron emission lines detected, assuming that the flux is dominated\nby the disk emission.\nThe occurrence of the burst near the end of the outburst is consistent with the behavior of XTE J1701-462\n\n\f6\n\nLin et al.\n\nchanging to that typical of an atoll source. Atoll sources\nare known to be much more prolific bursters than Z\nsources. Among the six classical Z sources, only GX\n17+2 has exhibited type I X-ray bursts (\u00a71). These\nsources accrete at high \u1e41, close to or above \u1e41Edd , as\ninferred from its radius expansion bursts. GX 17+2\nhas both short (\u03c4 . 10 s) and long (\u03c4 > 100 s)\nbursts. Burst-like events from Cyg X-2 are very short\n(\u03c4 \u223c 3 s), and many of them do not show cooling during burst decay. Thus their thermonuclear origin is inconclusive (Kuulkers et al. 1995; Wijnands et al. 1997;\nGalloway et al. 2008). XTE J1701-462 is different in that\nits bursts are detected when it accretes at low \u1e41, \u223c10%\nof \u1e41Edd and that all bursts are short (\u03c4 \u223c 6 s). From\nthe \u1e41 and the burst profiles (fast rise and short duration), these bursts are consistent with helium burning.\nSuch bursts are often seen in the atoll sources in their\nbanana branch (Galloway et al. 2008). Thus the unstable nuclear burning in these bursts should fall under the\nframework of the classical burst theory, indicating that\nZ sources can have regular bursts. The results that these\nbursts are consistent with helium burning can also be\nexplained if the NS is accreting H-poor material, as is\noften seen in ultra-compact X-ray binaries, which have\norbital periods of an hour or less and have helium accreted from a degenerate donor. There is no optical\nspectrum of the mass donor in XTE J1701-462 to determine whether it is H-poor. However, the 2006\u20132007\noutburst is very long (\u223c20 months), while ultra-compact\nX-ray binaries have never displayed such long outbursts\nwhen their light curves can be associated with the class\nof soft X-ray transients. Thus the mass donor in XTE\nJ1701-462 is probably a normal star transferring H-rich\nmaterial.\nSo far no bursts have been detected in the FB (except\nin the NB/FB vertex) from GX 17+2 (Kuulkers et al.\n2002), while the thermonuclear origin of the Burstlike events from Cyg X-2 is inconclusive (see references\nabove). While the detection of burst I from XTE J1701462 in a low luminosity FB might not be unique, given\nthe abundance of burst in the atoll upper banana branch\n(Galloway et al. 2008), it does cast doubt on the speculation that the Z-source FB is caused by unstable nuclear burning (Church et al. 2006). In \u00a72, we show that\nburst I does not interfere with the FB behavior, in that\nno jump in the hardness-intensity diagram is seen before and after the burst. In \u00a73, we also show that burst\nI should have spread over the whole NS surface, since\nthere is constant emission area during the decay. Thus,\nconsidering that the FB and bursts are different (e.g.,\nbursts rise in seconds, but the FB rises in minutes or\n\nlonger), if the FB is caused by unstable nuclear burning,\nit must be a different type of nuclear burning from that\nfor bursts, and it can coexist when burst I burns nuclear\nmaterial globally in XTE J1701-462. Although we cannot simply exclude a complex environment allowing the\nabove scenario, current theoretic studies do not favor coexistence of two types of unstable nuclear burning (e.g.,\nHeger et al. 2007). Thus the explanation of unstable nuclear burning for the FB is quite uncertain. Lin et al.\n(2009) offered an additional argument that the FB cannot be due to unstable nuclear burning, as the energy\nreleased to produce the FB would require a much higher\n\u1e41 than is observed. Lin et al. (2009) propose an alternative explanation for the FB, in which the inner disk radius contracts temporarily from an Eddington-expanded\nvalue toward the innermost stable circular orbit.\nThe burst rate depends on \u1e41 and is expected to\nbe zero at \u1e41 close to \u1e41Edd (Remillard et al. 2006;\nGalloway et al. 2008). While this is consistent with the\nfact that we do not observe bursts during the bright\nphase of the outburst for XTE J1701-462 and in most\nof Z sources, it does raise the question of why the Z\nsource GX 17+2 shows type-I X-ray bursts. One possible explanation could be that bursts are possible at\nhigh \u1e41, but only in the narrow \u1e41-range occupied by\nGX 17+2. We test this hypothesis by estimating the expected number of bursts from XTE J1701-462, for the\nduration when it was similar to GX 17+2. We estimate\nthat XTE J1701-462 has \u223c0.5-Ms of exposure when it resembles GX 17+2, i.e., with all three Sco-like Z branches\ntraced out, and thus has a similar \u1e41 as well. However,\nXTE J1701-462 has no burst detected in this \u223c0.5-Ms\ninterval, while we would have expected to see \u223c6 bursts,\nbased on the burst rate of GX 17+2 (12 bursts observed\nin 1 Ms with RXTE (Galloway et al. 2008)). Thus the\nburst rate in GX 17+2 is much higher than XTE J1701462 at similar \u1e41. It suggests that bursts in GX 17+2 are\nnot only due to its specific \u1e41, but might also depend on\nother factors such as the NS parameters or the chemical\ncomposition of the accreted matter.\nThe three bursts are detected at \u1e41 \u223c 10% \u1e41Edd ,\nwith the burst rate about one per ten hours, considering that the source is observed for several tens of hours\naround such \u1e41. This is consistent with the average value,\n\u223c12 hours from Galloway et al. (2008) or \u223c6 hours from\nRemillard et al. (2006), corresponding to the above \u1e41.\nThis research has made use of data obtained from the\nHigh Energy Astrophysics Science Archive Research Center (HEASARC), provided by NASA's Goddard Space\nFlight Center.
