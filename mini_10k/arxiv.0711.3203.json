On the one hand, this leads\nto dynamical information of molecular rotation; on the\nother hand, this opens up novel ways to control x rays.\nSuch a combination of an optical laser with x rays has\nproved very beneficial already in various setups. For intense laser pulses, ionization of atoms takes place, producing aligned, unoccupied atomic orbitals. They are\nprobed by using XUV light or x rays to excite an innershell electron into them [1, 2, 3]. For slightly lower laser\nintensities, one only modifies the atomic Rydberg manifold leading to electromagnetically induced transparency\nfor x rays [3, 4, 5].\nLaser-alignment of molecules was discovered experimentally by Normand et al. [6] and was later analyzed theoretically by Friedrich and Herschbach [7].\nOther alignment techniques, however, did exist before,\ne.g., with strong static electric and magnetic fields\nfor molecules with permanent electric and magnetic\ndipole moments, respectively [8, 9]. Friedrich and Herschbach [7] considered alignment with a continuous-wave\nlaser which lead to eigenstates of the coupled problem of\nmolecular rotation in the laser field. Ortigoso et al. [10]\ncarried out a systematic theoretical and computational\nstudy of laser-aligned linear molecules. They allowed for\npulsed lasers and rotational wave packets to investigate\nthe transition from a thermal ensemble to the continuouswave solution of Friedrich and Herschbach [7]. Aside of\nthis so-called adiabatic alignment, there is also transient\n\n(or impulsive) alignment [8, 9] which means that the\nmolecules are \"kicked\" with an intense, short laser pulse\nand thereafter evolve freely. This leads to brief, recurring\nperiods when all molecules in a sample are aligned [8, 9].\nThe work of Ortigoso et al. [10] was extended recently to\nsymmetric-top molecules by Hamilton et al. [11].\nThe alignment of a gaseous sample causes the individual molecules to basically rotate in the same way. Hence,\nat sufficiently low temperature, the x-ray absorption signal reflects the properties of a single molecule rather\nthan a rotational average. Adiabatic laser-alignment of\nmolecules is the only choice when the molecules are to be\nstudied with x rays from third-generation synchrotron\nsources due to long x-ray pulses of about 100 ps [12]\nwhich are several orders of magnitude longer than the\ntime scale of transient alignment of about 1 ps [8, 9].\nParticularly suited for the study of alignment is a dependence of the absorption cross section on the angle\nbetween the linear x-ray polarization and the figure axis\nof symmetric-top molecules. Specifically, such a linear\ndichroism can be found on single, isolated resonances in\nthe x-ray absorption near-edge fine structure (XANES)\nregion [13, 14]. For instance, above the carbon K edge,\nthere is a \u03c3 \u2217 shape resonance in hydrocarbons. The dependence of the cross section on the resonance on the\norientation of the molecules was theoretically and experimentally studied with x rays for molecules adsorbed on\nsurfaces [15].\nUsing x rays to quantify molecular alignment has several advantages over conventional methods. Typically,\nmolecular alignment is detected by, first, cleaving a\nmolecular bond with one laser pulse and ionizing the\nfragments with a very intense other laser pulse [8]. The\nlatter pulse leads to highly ionized fragments which undergo Coulomb explosion. Due to the complicated nature of the interaction of a laser with a molecule, this\n\n\f2\nis a very intricate technique to study molecular alignment; e.g., recently, the strong-field ionization probability of aligned molecules was measured and a nontrivial, molecule-specific angular dependence was found [16].\nTherefore, this technique is prone to systematic errors\nand it is highly desirable to have an alternative method\nfor the detection of molecular alignment.\nIn order to theoretically investigate the two-color problem, it is crucial to analyze and exploit the three different\ntime scales of the involved physical processes which are\nassumed to be well-separated by a few orders of magnitude from each other. First, the x-ray oscillations define the fastest timescale. For example, at the K edge\nof a bromine atom, \u03c9X = 13474 eV [12], a cycle period\namounts to \u03c92\u03c0X = 0.30694 as. Second, x-ray absorption\nleads to core-hole formation. A K vacancy in a bromine\natom relaxes with a decay time of \u03931 = 0.264 fs, i.e., the\nline width is \u0393 = 2.49 eV [17]. This relaxation defines\nthe coherence time scale, i.e., the time scale on which xray amplitudes instead of intensities must be considered\nand thus interference effects in x-ray absorption may occur due to molecular rotation. Third, the time scale of\nmolecular rotation, and x-ray and laser envelopes; the\nquickest of them defines the third scale. This last scale\nvaries with the choice of parameters; situations may arise,\ne.g., high laser intensity, where the separation of the third\ntime scale from the second is no longer sufficient and a\njoint treatment of the processes on both time scales is required. For this work, we expect the third time scale to\nbe of a few tens of femtoseconds to several picoseconds,\ni.e., a separate treatment of the physical processes on the\nsecond and on third time scales is feasible. Because of\nthis distinction of three time scales, the slower processes\ncan be taken to be constant while approximations to the\nfaster processes are obtained. Using the approximations\nto the faster process, the variation on the slower time\nscale can be determined.\nIn this work, we study the influence of molecular alignment on the absorption cross section for linearly polarized x rays. We devise a density matrix formalism for\nrotational motion of symmetric-top molecules under the\ninfluence of a laser. The laser-only equations are then\nextended to comprise the interaction with the x rays.\nOur work lays the theoretical foundation for our computational studies of bromotrifluoromethane (CF3 Br) in\nRef. 3 and the joint investigation of CF3 Br with experimentalists in Ref. 18.\nThe paper is structured as follows. Section II discusses\nthe theoretical foundation. We start with the laser-only\nproblem in Sec. II A; the full two-color problem (laser\nplus x rays) is examined in Sec. II B. The x-ray absorption cross section and derived quantities are discussed\nin Sec. II C. In Sec. III, a two-level electronic structure\nmodel is developed for bromine molecules. Computational details are given in Sec. IV and the results are\npresented in Sec. V. Conclusions are drawn in Sec. VI.\nOur equations are formulated in atomic units [19],\nwhere 1 hartree = 1 Eh is the unit of energy, 1 t0 is the\n\nunit of time, and 1 bohr = 1 a0 is the unit of length. The\nBoltzmann constant kB is unity and 1 Eh = 3.15775 \u00d7\n105 K is the unit of temperature. Intensities are given in\n\u22122\n15\n\u22122\nunits of 1 Eh t\u22121\n.\n0 a0 = 6.43641 \u00d7 10 W cm\nII.\nA.\n\nTHEORY\n\nLaser alignment of symmetric-top molecules\n1.\n\nThe freely rotating molecule\n\nWe assume the Born-Oppenheimer approximation and\nthe rigid-rotor approximation which implies that rotational and electronic degrees of freedom are decoupled [19, 20] and molecular vibrations are excluded [20].\nWithout interactions that reestablish a coupling, electronic structure and molecular rotation can be treated\nindependently. We deal in the following with two reference frames: one is the laboratory or space-fixed frame\nwhere the coordinates are denoted by x, y, z. The other\nframe is the molecule-fixed or body-fixed frame with the\ncoordinates a, b, c [20].\nThe molecular rotation is described by the rigid-rotor\nHamiltonian which reads [20]\n2\n2\n\u0124r = AJ\u02c6A\n+ B J\u02c6B\n+ C J\u02c6C2 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere A, B, and C are rotational constants. For a\nsymmetric-top molecule, \u0124r commutes with the square\n\u02c6\nof the angular momentum operator J~2 , the z component\nof the angular momentum in the space-fixed frame J\u02c6z ,\nand the c component of the angular momentum in the\nbody-fixed frame J\u02c6c [20, 21, 22]. The three operators give\nrise to the rotational quantum numbers J, K, and M , respectively, with K, M = \u2212J, . . . , J for integer J \u2265 0. We\nassume throughout a prolate symmetric top, A > B = C,\nwhere the axis A is identified with the figure axis c. For\nan oblate symmetric top, A = B > C and the axis C\nbecomes the figure axis c [20]. In this case, all A need\nto be replaced by C in what follows. We obtain from\nEq.

The eigenfunctions of the general asymmetric rotor can be expanded\nin this basis [8, 9].\nThe molecules in a gas sample are initially not in\na definite quantum state but are described by a thermodynamic ensemble [20, 23]. Therefore, a density\noperator formalism is beneficial [23, 24]. Let T be\nthe rotational equilibrium temperature of the ensemble\nand \u03b2 = T1 . Then, the density operator of a freely rotating symmetric-top molecule reads in its stationary eigenbasis (4)\nX\n\u033a\u02c6nucl =\n| JKM i wJK h JKM | ,\n(5)\nJ,K,M\n\nby \u03b1S (\u03c9L ) in the space-fixed frame.\nHamiltonian reads [28]\n\n1~\n\u2020 S\n~\n\u0124L (t) = \u2212 E\nL (t) \u03b1 (\u03c9L )EL (t) .\n2\n\n\u0124L (t) = \u22122\u03c0\u03b1 IL (t) \u03b1Szz (\u03c9L ) .\n\n(6)\n\nThe weights gI (J, K) reflect the nuclear spin statistics [20, 25] and\nZ=\n\nX\n\n(2J + 1)\n\nJ\n\nJ\nX\n\ngI (J, K) e\u2212\u03b2EJK\n\n(7)\n\nK=\u2212J\n\nis the partition function.\n2.\n\n(12)\n\nwhere we use a prime accent to indicate spherical tensor\n1\nS\ncomponents.

In order to solve\nRt (KM)\nEq. (26), the time integral \u010bJ \u2032 J (t\u2032 ) dt\u2032 needs to be\nts\n\nfound. By comparing Eq. (5) with Eq. (22), we obtain\n(KM)\nthe initial conditions cJ \u2032 J (ts ) = \u03b4J \u2032 J with the help of\nEqs. (6), (20), and (21). Employing standard numerical\nmethods for systems of differential equations [33], an approximate solution can be determined. In doing so, the\nfull propagation interval is decomposed into Nt subintervals which are sufficiently short such that the coeffi(KM)\ncients cJ \u2032\u2032 J (t) on the right-hand side of Eq. (26) and the\nlaser envelope, Eq. (9), can be assumed to be constant\non each subinterval.\nTo quantify the degree of alignment along the laser\npolarization axis, one typically uses the expectation\nvalue [8, 9, 23, 24]\n\nLet\n(KM)\n\ncJ \u2032 J\n\n(t) = h J \u2032 KM | \u03c8JKM , t iI\n\n(21)\n\nbe the time-dependent expansion coefficients. As the matrix representation (17) of the interaction Hamiltonian\nwith the laser is diagonal with respect to K and M , so\nis the coefficient matrix (21). With Eqs.

The x rays are\nassumed to be polarized linearly along the direction ~eX,M .\nBoth vectors are given with respect to the molecule-fixed,\nCartesian coordinate system.\nFor simplicity, we transform the vectors from the\nCartesian to the spherical basis [21, 22]. This change\nof coordinate system is indicated by a prime accent. It\nleaves the scalar product formally the same with the\nsum over Cartesian vector components j \u2208 {x, y, z} and\n\u03b1 \u2208 {a, b, c} replaced by a sum over projection quantum numbers m \u2208 {\u22121, 0, 1}.

Further, \u0124r is given in\nEq. (2), \u0124L (t) in Eq. (11), and \u0124X (t) in Eq. (29). Finally,\n\u0124M denotes the fixed-nuclei molecular Hamiltonian [19].\nTo describe the time-evolution of the interaction of a\nmolecule with a laser and x rays, we extend the density\noperator formalism of Sec. II A 3 to include electronic degrees of freedom. Initially, the molecule is in the electronic ground state | 0 i. The corresponding stationary\ndensity operator simply reads [24]\n\u033a\u02c6el = | 0 i h 0 | .\n\n(36)\n\nThe initial rotational density operator is given by a\nthermal distribution (5). Then, the joint rotationalelectronic problem is initially described by the direct\nproduct [24, 35]\n\u033a\u02c6 = \u033a\u02c6nucl \u2297 \u033a\u02c6el\n\n(37)\n\nbecause, by assumption, for t \u2264 ts , we have \u0124X (t) = 0\nin Eq. (35). The relevant equations from Sec. II A-\nEqs. (19), (20), (21), (23), (25), and (26)-can now be\ngeneralized to comprise also the electronic degree of freedom. To this end, we replace the nuclear rotational\nstates | JKM i with the direct product states | JKM, i i\nfrom Eq. (31) [35]. Formally, this replacement means\nonly that another index, namely, i needs to be added\nto the existing equations. The only thing one has to\npay attention to is the fact that the interaction with\nthe x rays-unlike the interaction with the laser (17)-is\ngenerally not diagonal in K and M . Hence, the coefficients (21) have to be replaced by\ncJKM,i;J \u2032 K \u2032 M \u2032 ,0 (t) = h JKM, i | \u03c8J \u2032 K \u2032 M \u2032 ,0 , t iI .\n\n(38)\n\nBy assumption, the molecule is initially in the electronic ground state (i = 0).

(35). We consider x-ray absorption to produce only electronically excited states (i 6= 0) with a\nsingle core hole which is an excellent approximation for\nthe moderate x-ray intensities at third-generation synchrotron sources. The core vacancies relax by x-ray fluorescence and Auger decay [12, 14]. The associated decay\nwidth is indicated as \u0393; it is assumed not to vary for\n\n\f6\ndifferent core-excited states. This is an excellent approximation when the core vacancy is always in the same shell\nand has always the same angular momentum.\nWe obtain the equation of motion for the joint problem\nin analogy to Eq.

(29) is approximately constant over the subintervals. (Please refer to\nthe introduction concerning a discussion of the involved\nphysical time scales which need to be taken into account.)\nFor our forthcoming approximations to be appropriate,\nthe duration of the subintervals are also required to be\nmuch longer than core-hole lifetimes \u03931 and the duration\nof x-ray oscillations \u03c92\u03c0X\nFor molecules without permanent electric dipole mo\u2032\nment, i.e., d~00\n= 0 [Eq. (33)], the second term in Eq. (43)\nvanishes exactly because the matrix element (32) is zero.\nOtherwise, this term leads to a negligible integral on\nthe time subintervals due to rapid oscillations, Eq.

Thereby, we assume moderate x-ray intensities, i.e., the total x-ray absorption probability for the full propagation interval is tiny. This also\nmeans that the third term is tiny because it depends\non coefficients with i 6= 0. Omitting the third term in\nEq. (43) implies that two- (and multi)-photon processes\nfor x rays are neglected.\nWith these arguments, the second and third terms in\nEq. (43) are omitted leading to the laser-only equations\nof motion (26). In other words, we treat the interaction\nwith the laser independently of the x rays in what follows.\n\ncJ \u2032\u2032 K \u2032\u2032 M \u2032\u2032 ,i\u2032\u2032 ;JKM,0 (t) .\n\n(43)\nThe first term on the left-hand side of Eq. (43) constitutes\nthe interaction of the laser with the rotational degrees of\nfreedom. It is the same as in Eq. (26) in the expanded\ndirect product space (31). Similarly, the second term in\nEq. (43) represents transitions between rotational states\ndue to the x rays. The third term in Eq.

Finally,\nthe third term describes transitions by x-ray absorption\nbetween rotational-electronic core-hole states. Since we\nneglect x-ray nonlinear processes, we set this term to\nzero.

(58) resembles the expression (40) in Ref. 4 for the\ncross section of laser-dressed atoms.\nGiven the instantaneous cross section (58), we can\ncompute experimentally more accessible quantities. The\ncross correlation of the cross section and the x-ray pulse\nis defined by [37]\nPi (\u03c4 ) =\n\nZ\u221e\n\n\u03c3i (t) JX (t \u2212 \u03c4 ) dt ,\n\ni =k, \u22a5, th .\n\n(59)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nHere, k and \u22a5 denote parallel and perpendicular laser\nand x-ray polarization vectors whereas th refers to a thermal ensemble, i.e., no laser radiation is present.

We assume that laser polarization ~eL\nand x-ray polarization ~eX are initially parallel and directed along the z axis. Keeping the laser polarization\nfixed ~eL = ~ez , one obtains the rotated x-ray polarization\nvector [20] with a passive rotation by \u03b8LX around the\ny axis as\n~eX = sin \u03b8LX ~ex + cos \u03b8LX ~ez .\n\n(61)\n\nThe vector ~eX needs to be transformed to the spherical\nbasis [21, 22] and then be subjected to Eq.

Generally, \u03c3\u22a5,k (t)\ndoes not vanish. However, we will show that there are\nno cross terms for the special case of the two level model\nin the ensuing Sec. III.\nThe angular dependence of \u03c3(\u03b8LX , t) can be investigated experimentally [3, 18] in terms of a wave plate scan,\ni.e., the ratio\nZ\u221e\n1\n\u03c3(\u03b8LX , t) JX (t) dt\nRwave (\u03b8LX ) =\nPth (0)\n\u2212\u221e\n\n= cos2 \u03b8LX Rk/th (0) + sin2 \u03b8LX R\u22a5/th (0)\n+ sin \u03b8LX cos \u03b8LX R\u22a5,k/th (0)\n(64)\nis measured, varying \u03b8LX . In addition to Eq. (60), we\nP\n(\u03c4 )\ndefine R\u22a5,k/th (\u03c4 ) = P\u22a5,k\nusing Eq. (59) with \u03c3\u22a5,k (t).\nth (\u03c4 )\n\nsymmetry [42]. The electronic transition is described\n\u02c6\nby the matrix element d~\u03c3g 1s,\u03c3u 4p = h \u03c3g 1s | d~ | \u03c3u 4p i\nin Eq. (33) formed with the Cartesian dipole opera\u02c6\ntor d~ = (a, b, c)T in the molecule-fixed frame. The vanishing integrals rule [41, 42] says that the components\nof d~\u03c3g 1s,\u03c3u 4p can only be nonzero, if the direct product\n\u02c6~\nrepresentation of the representations to which h \u03c3g 1s |, d,\nand | \u03c3u 4p i belong, contains the totally symmetric representation. The question therefore is, for i \u2208 {a, b, c},\n+\ndoes \u0393\u2217 \u03c3g 1s \u2297 \u0393i \u2297 \u0393\u03c3u 4p contain \u0393\u03a3g ?\nThere are two linear combinations of the Br 1s orbitals.\n+\nThese are of \u03a3+\ng and \u03a3u symmetry, respectively; the\n+\n\u03c3u 4p orbital has \u03a3u symmetry. The Cartesian component c of the dipole operator is of \u03a3+\nu symmetry whereas\na and b are of \u03a0u symmetry. With the help of the direct\nproduct table of D\u221eh [42], we find that only the direct\nproduct of the combination of the Br 1s orbitals with \u03a3+\ng\n\u02c6\nsymmetry with the c component of d~ and \u03c3u 4p leads to\na non-vanishing transition matrix element. This linear\ncombination is thus identified with the \u03c3g 1s molecular\norbital in the two-level model. Only the c component dc\nof d~\u03c3g 1s,\u03c3u 4p is nonvanishing. This implies that, according to the scalar product in Eq. (32), x rays are only\nabsorbed with an x-ray polarization vector component\nalong the internuclear axis; there is no absorption for\nperpendicular polarizations. In computations, we focus\non ratios such as Eq. (60). Hence, our results are independent of the value of dc . Since the molecular orbitals\nare glued to the rigid nuclear framework, they rotate with\nthe molecule. Hence, the photoabsorption is sensitive to\nthe spatial alignment of the molecules.\nFor the two-level model, one can further simplify the\ndependence on the angle between laser and x-ray polarizations \u03b8LX of the cross section (63). Due to the fact\nthat the dipole vector d~\u03c3g 1s,\u03c3u 4p has only a nonvanishing c component (or m = 0 component) dc , the cross\nterm in Eq. (62) becomes\n\u2032,k\n\nIII.\n\nELECTRONIC STRUCTURE MODEL\n\nWe assume a two-level model for the electronic structure of a bromine molecule (Br2 ). For simplicity, we treat\nthe two states as Hartree-Fock orbitals [19]; yet our reasoning is general and not limited by this assumption. The\nmodel is justified by the experimental K edge absorption\nspectrum of Br2 which is shown in Fig. 1 of Ref. 40; it\nexhibits an isolated pre-edge resonance which is assigned\nto a transition from the gerade linear combination of the\nBr 1s atomic orbitals, the \u03c3g 1s molecular orbital, to the\n\u03c3u 4p antibonding molecular orbital. The two molecular\norbitals are displayed in Fig. 1 of this paper.\nWe need to find out what the dipole selection rules are\nfor the transition \u03c3g 1s \u2192 \u03c3u 4p using symmetry arguments [41, 42].

Recalling the\nrule (16) to evaluate the matrix elements in Eq. (65),\nwe obtain conditions that need to be fulfilled such that\nthe Clebsch-Gordan coefficients do not vanish. As we focus on the m = 0 component, we obtain from Eq. (16)\n\u2032,\u22a5\nthe equality K = K \u2032\u2032 .

The polarizabilities are determined with coupled-cluster linear response methods\nfor several basis sets. Theoretical SDQ-MP4 values, \u1fb1ref (0) = 44.79 a.u. and \u2206\u03b1ref (0) = 25.68 a.u., were taken from Table 3 in\nRef. 43.\n\nR\u22a5,k/th (0) = 0 and thus\nRwave,model (\u03b8LX ) = cos2 \u03b8LX Rk/th (0)+sin2 \u03b8LX R\u22a5/th (0) ,\n(66)\nwith Eq. (60).\nA two-level electronic structure model, similar to the\none used in this section, is suitable when the x-ray energy lies on an isolated resonance in the absorption spectrum of a molecule. Neglecting the coupling between nuclear and electronic motion as well as vibrations due to\nelectronic excitation [44], as we have done in this paper,\nthe two-level model can easily be generalized to a full\nab initio description because, in this case, the electronic\nprocesses are completely decoupled from the nuclear motion. The electronic transitions matrix elements are determined in the fixed-nuclei approximation and inserted\ninto Eq. (58).\nIV.\n\nCOMPUTATIONAL DETAILS\n\nBased on the theory of Secs. II and III, we have developed the program alignmol of the fella package [45].\nThe program handles symmetric-top molecules where\nthe special case of a linear molecule is treated by letting K = 0 in all equations of this paper and eliminating\nsums over K. A large number of parameters are needed\nto specify the molecular properties, the numerical accuracy, and the laser- and x-ray pulses which we discuss in\nthe following paragraphs.\nThe Br2 molecule is a linear rotor with an internuclear distance of R = 2.289 \u00c5 [40]. The rotational con1\nstants in Eq. (3) are given by A = 0 and B = 2\u03bcR\n2,\nwhere \u03bc is the reduced mass [20]. There are two stable, naturally occurring isotopes of bromine: 79 Br and\n81\nBr [46]. The first one, 79 Br, has a mass of 78.9183361 u\nand a natural abundance of p 79 Br = 50.69% whereas\nthe second one, 81 Br, has a mass of 80.916289 u and a\nnatural abundance of p 81 Br = 49.31% [46, 47]. This\n\nleads to three possible combinations of isotopes in Br2\nand thus to three different rotational constants: B =\n0.081537 cm\u22121 for 79 Br2 , B = 0.079524 cm\u22121 for 81 Br2 ,\nand B = 0.080530 cm\u22121 for 79 Br\u201381 Br.\nBoth bromine isotopes have a nuclear spin quantum\nnumber of I = 32 [46]. The statistical weights in\nEq. (5) for an isotope-pure diatomic molecule with nuclear spin I, are given by [20, 25]\n\u001a\nI + 1 ; J even\ngI (J, K) =\n.\n(67)\nI\n; J odd\nFor 79 Br\u201381 Br, the nuclei are distinguishable and the statistical weight is gI (J, K) \u2261 1. As the equations in this\npaper are mostly nonlinear in the rotational constants\nand the statistical weights, it is required that for each\nof the three combinations of bromine isotopes, a separate computation of the desired quantities is carried out.\nThe results are then averaged assigning the weights p279 Br\nto results for 79 Br2 , p281 Br to 81 Br2 , and 2 p 79 Br p 81 Br\nto 79 Br\u201381 Br.\nWe assume a rotational temperature of Br2 of T =\n30 K; the initial rotational density matrix (5) needs to\nbe represented in terms of a finite number of symmetricrotor functions (4) [for K = 0 because Br2 is linear].\nWe chose angular momenta up to Jmax = 70. The\nvalue for Jmax is determined to be sufficiently large such\nthat the contribution with J = Jmax to the partition\nfunction (7) is < 10\u22126 . For each J = 0, . . . , Jmax all\nsymmetric-rotor functions (4) with M = \u2212J, . . . , J are\nemployed to represent the density operator; sums over K\nare omitted. The total energy of the Gaussian laser\npulse (9) is Epulse = 2 mJ; it lasts (FWHM) \u03c4L = 100 ps.\nThe energy and duration of the pulse imply a peak inW\ntensity of \u2248 1012 cm\n2 on the axis of a laser beam with\na Gaussian radial profile perpendicular to the beam axis\nof a FWHM width of \u033aL = 40 \u03bcm. We do not consider a\nradial intensity variation but take the value on axis.\nAs the molecule is in the field of the aligning laser,\nwe need to determine the dynamical polarizability tensor\n\n\f11\n\n \u0307\n \u0327\nFIG. 2: (Color online) The time evolution of cos2 \u03b8 (t)\n[Eq. (27)] of bromine molecules is given by the solid (red)\nline as a function of the laser pulse which is depicted by a\ndashed (black) line.\n\nM\n\nin the molecule-fixed reference frame \u03b1 (\u03c9L ) [27, 48].\nThis means specifically the average dynamical polarizability \u1fb1(\u03c9L ) [Eq. (14)] and the dynamical polarizability anisotropy \u2206\u03b1(\u03c9L ) [Eq. (15)] which both enter\nEq. (17). The quantities can be computed in fixed-nuclei\napproximation utilizing the ab initio quantum chemistry\nprogram package dalton [49]. We employ molecular\nlinear-response theory in conjunction with wave function models of increasing sophistication: coupled-cluster\nsingles (CCS), second-order approximate coupled-cluster\nsingles and doubles (CC2), and coupled-cluster singles\nand doubles (CCSD) [48]. The cc-pVDZ [correlation consistent polarized valence double zeta] and aug-cc-pVXZ\n[augmented cc-pVXZ] (for X = D, T, Q [D: double,\nT: triple, Q: quadruple]) basis sets [50, 51] are used to\ndescribe the bromine atoms. We examine the static case,\n\u03c9L = 0 Eh , and the dynamic case for the photon energy\nof an 800 nm Ti:Sapphire laser, \u03c9L = 0.057 Eh .\nOur average polarizabilities and the polarizability\nanisotropies are listed in Table I. A moderately rapid\nconvergence with respect to the basis set quality is\nobserved for the individual methods; the difference is\nmuch smaller between corresponding results for augcc-pVTZ and aug-cc-pVQZ than between the results\nfor \u03c9L = 0 Eh and \u03c9L = 0.057 Eh , i.e., the basis set\nlimit is nearly reached. We conclude that the remaining deviations between methods for a specific \u03c9L and\nthe aug-cc-pVQZ basis reflect the differences between\nthe coupled-cluster methods. Comparing our best results\nfor \u03c9L = 0 Eh , CCSD and aug-cc-pVQZ, with theoretical SDQ-MP4 values from Table 3 in Ref. 43, we note a\nsatisfactory agreement. In our computations, we use the\nvalue of \u2206\u03b1(0.057 Eh ) = 27.45 a.u. for the polarizability\nanisotropy.\nThe coefficients (21) of the rotational density matrix\nin Eq. (22) are represented here by Neq = Jmax values\nfor J \u2032 which determines the number of equations of motion (26) for each initial symmetric-rotor state | JKM i.\nWe use the Runge-Kutta algorithm of fourth order [33]\nto compute the time evolution of the density matrix via\nEq. (26). The propagation takes place over the time interval [\u2212400 ps, 400 ps] which is subdivided into Ntime =\n6002 time steps.\nA Gaussian shape of the x-ray pulses similar to the\n\nFIG. 3: (Color online) Ratio of cross correlations Rk/\u22a5 (\u03c4 )\n[Eq. (60a)] for bromine molecules as a function of the time\ndelay between laser and x-ray pulses.\n\nlaser pulse (9) is assumed. As the interaction with\nthe x rays is treated in terms of a one-photon process,\nthe specification of a value for the peak intensity becomes unnecessary; the relevant prefactor cancels once\nratios are formed as in Eqs. (60) and (66). Only, the\nFWHM duration of the x-ray pulse needs to be given. We\nchoose \u03c4X = 120 ps, a typical value for a third-generation\nsynchrotron radiation source [12]. The cross correlation\nof the cross section and the x-ray flux (59) is computed\nvia numerical integration using the trapezoid rule [33].\nTo this end, we assume the laser pulse to be centered at\nzero, Eq. (9), and use an equidistant grid of NX = 1003\nx-ray pulses, i.e., 1003 different time delays \u03c4 , over the\nwhole propagation interval [\u2212400 ps, 400 ps].\n\nV.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nHere, we exemplify the theory of the previous sections\nfor bromine molecules. We picked laser and x-ray pulse\nparameters in the previous Sec. IV; the pulse durations\nwere chosen such that they are comparable; the resulting\nmolecular dynamics is shown in Fig. 2. We give the time\nevolution of cos2 \u03b8 (t) for the rotational wave packet\n[Eq. (27)]. From the figure it becomes clear that we are in\nthe regime of adiabatic alignment because the temporal\nevolution of cos2 \u03b8 (t) and of the laser pulse are practically the same [8, 9]. Even the shape of the molecular\nresponse is very similar to the one of the laser pulse. Yet\nthe response of the molecule is not totally Gaussian as\nindicated by the slight deviation between the two curves\nin Fig. 2.\nThe ratio of cross correlations Rk/\u22a5 (\u03c4 ) [Eq. (60a)] between cross section and x-ray flux is displayed in Fig. 3.\nThe ratio of total x-ray absorption between laser on\nand laser off is given by Eq. (66). It is plotted in Fig. 4\nin relation to the angle between laser and x-ray polarization vectors \u03b8LX . Without laser, there is only a thermal\nensemble and the angular dependence vanishes.\n\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe devised a theory for the x-ray absorption of\nsymmetric-top molecules subject to an intense nonres-\n\n\f12\n\nFIG. 4: (Color online) Dependence of the ratio between the\nx-ray absorption signals of laser-aligned bromine molecules\nversus a thermal ensemble on the angle \u03b8LX between laser\nand x-ray polarization vectors.\n\nonant laser. The rigid-rotor approximation was assumed\nand a density-matrix formalism was used to describe a\nthermal ensemble of rotational states evolving in time.\nThe x-ray absorption is treated in terms of a one-photon\nprocess. The very different time scales of molecular rotation and electronic relaxation (core-hole lifetime) facilitated a separation of the two problems, i.e., the molecular\nrotation was treated separately from the x-ray absorption. The electronic structure of bromine molecules was\ndescribed in terms of a simple parameter-free two-level\nmodel for the \u03c3g 1s \u2192 \u03c3u 4p pre-edge resonance. The\nsymmetry of the resonance caused a linear dichroism-\nlight was only absorbed for a linear polarization component along the internuclear axis of Br2 -which lead to a\nmodulation of the photoabsorption with respect to the\nalignment of the molecule.\nOur theory was realized in terms of the alignmol program which is part of the fella package [45]. The dynamic dipole polarizability for the laser frequency was\ndetermined for Br2 using three ab initio coupled-cluster\nmethods of increasing precision: CCS, CC2, and CCSD;\nit was found not to deviate significantly from the static\npolarizability. We investigated the time evolution of the\nalignment of Br2 molecules in the adiabatic regime. The\nx-ray absorption is studied in terms of the experimentally accessible ratio of cross correlations between cross\nsection and x-ray pulse for several combinations of laser\non and off and parallel and perpendicular linear polar-\n\n[1] R.

A continuous\nvariation of the angle between the polarization vectors\nwas also investigated.\nThis article forms the theoretical basis for future\nstudies. In forthcoming papers, we will apply our\ntheory to the symmetric-top molecule bromotrifluoromethane (CF3 Br) [3, 18]. There, we will compare our\nresults with experimental data. Further perspectives include obtaining absolute cross sections from our theory.\nFor this purpose one needs a quantitative description\nof the electronic structure of the molecule, i.e., one requires transition dipole moments instead of our two-level\nelectronic structure model. The moments can be obtained from existing ab initio program packages. Our\nwork provides an alternative way to the established but\nintricate [16] Coulomb-explosion technique [8] to study\nlaser-controlled molecular rotation in the gas phase which\nadditionally opens up the possibility to study the lasermanipulated rotation of an ensemble of molecules in solution [52] where the Coulomb-explosion technique is\nbound to fail. Moreover, with our theory, one can interpret experimental data; the symmetry of molecular\nresonances in the gas phase enters our formulas in terms\nof selection rules for dipole matrix elements. In conjunction with experiments, our approach offers a novel route\nto determine the symmetry of resonances. It thus complements conventional methods using clamped molecules\non surfaces [53] and angle-resolved photoion yield spectroscopy [54].\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe would like to thank Linda Young and Phay Ho\nfor fruitful discussions and a critical reading of the\nmanuscript.
