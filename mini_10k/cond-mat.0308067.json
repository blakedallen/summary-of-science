Therefore the\n|1> => |1'>\ndrag is realized due to exchange of phonons\nwith zero energy and finite momenta. The phonon\npropagator D(q,\u03c9 ) is never on the \"mass surface\" since \u03c9 =0\nand \u03c9 q\u2260 0, magnetodrag is only mediated by virtual phonons.\nMagnetodrag can be due to exchange of virtual acoustic and\noptic phonons. Two factors determine their relative contributions: the optic phonon propagator D(q,\u03c9 ) is smaller at \u03c9 =0\nwhile the vertex part \u0393 is larger than that of acoustic phonons.\n\n\u001d\n\n\u0001\n\n\u0001\n\n1/ 2\n\n\u0007\u0004\u0006 \b\n\u0003\u0004\u0002 \u0005\nl!\nl '!\n\n2\n\n\u039b=30 nm, d=20 nm\n\n0.02\n\n0.01\n\n\u0393ll ' (q ) = B (q)\u03b4 k,k \u2032+ qx Qll ' (t ) dz\u03c1 ( z) exp(iqz z),\nQll ' (t ) =\n\nT=1 K, \u03bc=200 m V s\n\n\u03bd =5 \u03bd =4\n\n1.0\n\nMagnetodrag due to virtual phonons\n\nT is the transition matrix element and in\nthe second order of the PT is given by\nthis diagram.\nEach solid dot corresponds\nto the electron phonon\nvertex part \u0393 in this diagram.\n\nDrag rate in an asymmetric double\nquantum well system\n\n1.2\n\nT1\u03b3,2 \u21921', 2' \u03b4 (\u03b5 1 + \u03b5 2 \u2212 \u03b5 1\u2032 \u2212 \u03b5 2\u2032 )\n\n\u001c\n\n2\u03c0\n\n\u001c\n\nW1\u03b3, 2\u21921',2 ' =\n\nDouble peak structure due to\nthe screening effects\n\n7\n\n8\n\nT\n\n\u03bd1=1\n\u03bd2=1\n\n0.1\n\n\u03bd =2\n0.0\n2\n\n0.0\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\nMagnetic field [T]\n\nT=1 K, \u03bc=200 m V s\n2\n-1 -1\nT=1 K, \u03bc=25 m V s\n2\n-1 -1\nT=7 K, \u03bc=200 m V s\n2\n-1 -1\nT=7 K, \u03bc=25 m V s\n15\n-2\nn=1.5 10 m , \u0392=9 T\n2\n\n1.2\n\n-1\n\n-1\n\n0.8\n\n0.4\n\n0.0\n-1.0\n\n-0.5\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\nElectron density shift \u2206n/n\n\nMagnetic field [T]\nFig. 4. Drag scattering rate as a function of magnetic field at various temperatures\nwith the screening effects by \u03b5(q\u22a5,\u03c9) in Eq. (1) and for the completely spin\ndegenerated case. The drag rate shows a double-peaked structure as a function of\nfilling factor, firstly revealed in a recent theory for the Coulomb drag by B\u00f8nsager et\nal [1] and observed experimentally by Rubel et al [2].\n\nFig. 5. Drag scattering rate at mismatched densities as a\nfunction of the magnetic field without the screening\neffects. Inset shows the drag rate on assumption that the\ndrag is negative when the outermost Landau level of one\nlayer is more than half filled while the other is less than\nhalf filled [3] with the screening effects included.\n\nFig. 6. Normalized dependence of the transresistance\non shift of electron density from one layer to the other\nfor various temperatures and mobilities. The total\nelectron density remains unchanged and the avarage\nLandau level filling factor does not correspond to the\nhalf filling factor.\n\nConclusions\n\u2022 We have calculated the magnetodrag scattering rate between spatially separated 2D electron\nlayers due to virtual phonon exchange with and without screening effects.\n\u2022 The drag rate as a function of magnetic field shows the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations without\nthe screening effects. The screening effects result to the double-peaked structure, firstly\nrevealed for the Coulomb magnetodrag by B\u00f8nsager et al [1] and observed by Rubel et al [2,3].\n\u2022 The drag rate as a function of T has a peak without the screening effects. At small T it increases\nas a power-law function and at high T it decreases as T-1. At half filling the drag rate diverges at\nT=0. The screening eliminates this divergence and results to its monotonic increase in T.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nReferences\n\nThis research was partially supported by the Ministry of Science\nand Education of Armenia.
