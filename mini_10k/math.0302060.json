Reversing the orientation of a\n\u2032\n\u2032\ncomponent L\u2032 \u2282 L multiplies the polynomial by q \u22126*lk(L ,L\\L ) where lk(L\u2032 , L\\\nL\u2032 ) is the linking number of L\u2032 with its complement in L.\nThe colored Jones polynomial. We briefly recall the basics about\nthe colored Jones polynomial of links (for more details consult [2], [1], [6,\nSections 3,4], and references therein). Given an oriented framed link L whose\ncomponents are colored (marked) by non-negative integers (or, equivalently,\nby irreducible representations of Uq (sl2 ), with integer n corresponding to\nthe (n + 1)-dimensional representation Vn ), the colored Jones polynomial\nJn (L) takes values in Z[q, q \u22121 ]. The label n stands for the coloring, that\nis, for a function from the set of components of L to non-negative integers.\nIf all components of L are colored by 1, the invariant is the original Jones\npolynomial of L. If a component of L is colored by 0, deleting this component\npreserves the value of the colored Jones polynomial.\nFor a framed knot K we denote by Jn (K) the Jones polynomial of K\ncolored by n. Thus, J1 (K) is the original Jones polynomial of K (and does\nnot depend on the framing), while J0 (K) = 1 for any knot K.\nMore generally, one could label link components by arbitrary finite-dimensional\nrepresentations of Uq (sl(2)). This does not give any extra information since\nthe invariant is additive relative to the direct sum of representations,\nJV \u2295W (K) = JV (K) + JW (K),\n2\n\n\fbut allows us to express the colored Jones polynomial via the Jones polynomials of cables. First, the Jones polynomial JV \u2297W (K) of a knot K labelled\nby V \u2297 W equals the Jones polynomial of the 2-cable K 2 of K with components labelled by V and W. The Jones polynomial JV1\u2297n (K) equals the\noriginal Jones polynomial of the n-cable K n of K.\nFor generic q the quantum group Uq (sl(2)) has one irreducible representation Vn in each dimension (we consider representations where q H has only\npowers of q as eigenvalues). The Grothendieck group of this category of representations is free abelian with a basis given by images [Vn ], n \u2265 0 of all\nirreducible representations. We put square brackets around Vn to distinguish\na representation from its image in the Grothendieck group. Another basis in\nthe Grothendieck group is given by all tensor powers of V1 .\nUsing the formula Vn \u2297 V1 \u223c\n= Vn+1 \u2295 Vn\u22121 and induction on n, one checks\nthat\n\u230an\n\u230b\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2\nX\nn\u2212k\n\u2297(n\u22122k)\nk\n[Vn ] =\n[V1\n].\n(1)\n(\u22121)\nk\nk=0\n\nThus, the colored Jones polynomial Jn (K) of a knot K can be expressed via\nJones polynomials of its cables:\n\u0012\n\nn\n\nJn (K) =\n\n\u230a2\u230b\nX\n\n(\u22121)\n\nk\n\nk=0\n\n\u0013\nn\u2212k\nJ(K n\u22122k ).\nk\n\n(2)\n\nThis formula generalizes from knots to links, by summing over all connected\ncomponents of a link:\n\u230a2\u230b\nX\nn\n\nJn (L) =\n\nk=0\n\n(\u22121)\n\n|k|\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\nn\u2212k\nJ(Ln\u22122k ),\nk\n\n(3)\n\nwhere k is a function from the set of link components to non-negative integers.\nWe define the colored Jones polynomial by formula (3). Since the Jones\npolynomial (which appears on the right) depends slightly on the orientation\nof each cable component, we need to specify our choices of orientations. Each\ncomponent of L is oriented. When forming the m-cable of a component, if m\nis even we orient half of the strands one way and the rest the opposite way.\nIf m is odd, we orient m+1\nstrands by way of the original orientation of the\n2\ncomponent, and the remaining strands the opposite way.\nWith this definition, Jn (L) does not depend on the orientations of components colored by even integers, while reversing the orientation of an odd\u2032\n\u2032\ncolored component L\u2032 multiplies the polynomial by q \u22126*lk(L ,Lodd \\L ) , where\nLodd is the sublink of L made of all odd-colored components.\n3\n\n\fIf K is the 0-framed unknot,\ndef\n\nJn (K) = [n + 1] =\n\nq n+1 \u2212 q \u2212n\u22121\n,\nq \u2212 q \u22121\n\nthe quantum dimension of Vn .\nChanging the framing of a component multiplies the colored Jones polynomial by a power of q, as explained in the formula below and figure 2.\nL1\n\nL0\n\nn\n\nn\n\nFigure 2: Change of framing\n\nJn (L1 ) = q \u22122m(m+1) Jn (L0 ) if n = 2m,\nJn (L1 ) = q \u22122m(m+2) Jn (L0 ) if n = 2m + 1,\nwhere n is the color of the component.\nReduced colored Jones polynomial. Another common normalization\nfor the colored Jones polynomial of knots is\ndef Jn (K)\nJen (K) =\n.\n[n + 1]\n\nWe will call Jen (K) the reduced colored Jones polynomial. The reduced polynomial of the 0-framed unknot is 1. We extend this normalization to colored\nlinks with a distinguished component, by\ndef Jn (L)\nJen (L) =\n,\n[n + 1]\n\nwhere n is the color of the distinguished component. The reduced colored\nJones polynomial has integral coefficients.\n\n4\n\n\f2\n\nFirst non-trivial examples\n\nCohomology of cables. Take a framed link L, its cable Ln , and consider\nthe complex C(Ln ) and its cohomology groups H(Ln ) (we refer the reader to\n[4] for definitions of C and H). These groups are invariants of L, and depend\nnon-trivially on its framing. The Euler characteristic of H(Ln ) is the Jones\npolynomial of the cable Ln . We will use the grading conventions of [5].\nCategorification of J2 (K). We would like to have a cohomology theory\nof links whose Euler characteristic is the colored Jones polynomial. Let's start\nwith the first non-trivial example beyond the original Jones polynomial: our\nlink is a framed knot K colored by the three-dimensional representation V2 .\nNote that V2 is a direct summand of V1 \u2297V1 and the complementary summand\nis the trivial representation:\nV1 \u2297 V1 \u223c\n= V2 \u2295 V0 .\nThis formula translates into a simple relation between the Jones polynomials:\nJ2 (K) = J(K 2 ) \u2212 1.\n\n(4)\n\nTo categorify J(K 2 ) we take the cohomology of the 2-cable of K. Since\nJ0 (K) = 1, we simply assume that its categorification is the abelian group Z\nplaced in bidegree (0, 0).\nFormula (4) says that to categorify J2 (K) we need to \"substract\" Z from\nH(K 2 ). This could be achieved by taking the cone of some map H(K 2 ) \u2192 Z\nor of a map going in the opposite direction, from Z to H(K 2 ). This map\nshould be natural. In the cohomology theory H natural maps come from\ncobordisms between links. Note that Z is the cohomology of the empty link\n\u2205 and there is a canonical cobordism in R3 \u00d7 [0, 1] between K 2 and \u2205. In the\n2-cable K 2 two copies of K run parallel next to each other, and there is a\nstandard embedding of an annulus into R3 with K 2 as its boundary (the two\ncomponents of K 2 will be oppositely oriented if we orient our annulus and\ninduce the orientation onto its boundary). Push the interior of the annulus\ninto the interior of R3 \u00d7 [0, 1] slighly away from the boundary component\nR3 \u00d7 {0} that contains K 2 . The resulting annulus SK in R3 \u00d7 [0, 1] is an\noriented cobordism between K 2 and the empty link. Its Euler characteristic\nis 0 and it induces a bidegree (0, 0) map between bigraded cohomology groups\nH(K 2 ) and H(\u2205) \u223c\n= Z. This map is well-defined up to overall minus sign. On\nthe level of complexes, we have a map u : C(K 2 ) \u2192 Z, well-defined (up\nto the minus sign) in the homotopy category of complexes. We define the\ncomplex C2 (K) as the cone of u, shifted by [\u22121] (so that Z is in degree 1),\n5\n\n\fand cohomology groups H2 (K) as the cohomology of C2 (K). There is a short\nexact sequence of complexes\n0 \u2212\u2192 Z[\u22121] \u2212\u2192 C2 (K) \u2212\u2192 C(K 2 ) \u2212\u2192 0\ngiving rise to a long exact sequence of cohomology groups\nu\n\n\u2212\u2192 H2 (K) \u2212\u2192 H(K 2 ) \u2212\u2192 Z \u2212\u2192\nIn this sequence at most one boundary map could be non-zero (the one from\nZ to H21,0 (K)). This map is non-zero if and only if u is not surjective. It's\neasy to see, and we do it below, that u(H(K 2 )) is a subgroup of index 1 or\n2 in Z.\nStrictly speaking, in the above discussion we should fix a plane diagram D\nof K, the associated diagram D 2 of the 2-cable K 2 , and consider the complex\nC(D 2 ). From two diagrams D0 and D1 of K related by a Reidemeister move\nfor framed knots, we obtain diagrams D02 and D12 of K 2 and a diagram of\ncomplexes and homomorphisms\nu\n\n0\nC(D02 ) \u2212\u2212\u2212\n\u2192\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\ny\n\nu\n\nZ\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\u223c\ny=\n\n1\nC(D12 ) \u2212\u2212\u2212\n\u2192 Z\n\nwhich commutes up to overall minus sign. Therefore, the cones of u0 and\nu1 are homotopy equivalent and isomorphism classes of groups H2i,j (K) are\ninvariants of K.\nSince SK is also a cobordism from the empty link to K 2 , it induces a map\nu : Z \u2192 C(K 2 ) and we could alternatively define the cohomology groups of\nK colored by 2 as the cohomology of the cone of u\u2032 .\nIdeally, we would like the two resulting cohomology theories to be naturally isomorphic. Right off, we could see that they are if 2 is invertible in the\nbase ring. Let k be a commutative ring where 2 is invertible (for instance, a\nfield of characteristic other than 2, or Z[ 12 ].) Tensoring u\u2032 and u with k we get\nmaps u\u2032 : k \u2192 C(K 2 ) \u2297Z k and u : C(K 2 ) \u2297Z k \u2192 k, and the induced maps on\ncohomology groups (we don't bother inventing different notations for these\nmaps). The composition uu\u2032 : k \u2192 k is the value of the invariant on the\ncomposition of the two cobordisms given by the annulus SK . This composition is a cobordism in R3 \u00d7 [0, 1] between empty links, and is isotopic to the\n\u2032\n\n6\n\n\ftorus standardly embedded into R4 . Its invariant is \u00b12, therefore, uu\u2032 = \u00b12.\nSince 2 is invertible, we can decompose\nH(K 2 )k \u223c\n= im(u\u2032 ) \u2295 ker(u),\n\n(5)\n\nand derive isomorphisms\nH2 (K)k \u223c\n= coker(u\u2032 )\n= ker(u) \u223c\n\n(6)\n\nproving that the two definitions lead to isomorphic cohomology theories\n(H(K 2 )k in (5) stands for cohomology of C(K 2 ) \u2297Z k and H2 (K)k in (6)\nu\nfor the cohomology of the total complex of 0 \u2192 C(K 2 ) \u2297Z k \u2192 k \u2192 0).\nThe above argument implies that u(H(K 2 )) \u2282 Z has index 1 or 2.\nFraming: The colored Jones polynomial J2 (K) depends in a simple way\non the framing of K. Change in the framing multiplies the polynomial by\nq \u00b14 . The cohomology theory H2 (K) has a more complicated dependence on\nthe framing. Already when K is the unknot with framing m > 0, the rank\nof H(K 2 ) is 2 + 2m, and that of H2 (K) is 1 + 2m. In particular, cohomology\nof two knots that differ by a framing are not just overall shifts of each other.\nIn general, if K is a knot and K1 is obtained from K by twisting by a large\nslope, an overall shift superimposes H2 (K) and H2 (K1 ) except for a long tail\nin H2 (K1 ) trailing along two adjacent diagonals in the bigrading plane (the\ntail is essentially the cohomology of the unknot with a large framing).\nExample: For the 0-framed unknot K,\n\u001a\nZ if i = 0 and j \u2208 {\u22122, 0, 2},\ni,j\n\u223c\nH2 (K) =\n0 otherwise,\nfor both definitions of H2 .\nNote: The complex C2 (K) and its cohomology H2 (K) do not depend on\nthe orientation of K.\nCategorification of J3 (K). Direct sum decomposition\nV1\u22973 \u223c\n= V3 \u2295 V1 \u2295 V1\nimplies that, for a framed knot K,\nJ3 (K) = J(K 3 ) \u2212 2J(K).\n7\n\n\fTo categorify J(K 3 ), we form the 3-cable K 3 of K, take its cochain complex\nC(K 3 ) and its cohomology H(K 3 ). Choose a plane diagram of K and the\ncorresponding diagram of the cable. Enumerate the components of K 3 by\n1, 2 and 3 so that 2 is in the middle, and orient component 2 oppositely from\n1 and 3, see figure 3.\n1\n2\n3\n\nFigure 3: A close-up of K 3\nConsider two annuli in the neighbourhood of K in R3 , one with components 1 and 2 as the boundary, and the other with components 2 and 3 as\nthe boundary. Push the interiors of the annuli into R3 \u00d7 [0, 1] away from\nthe boundary. Two cobordisms from K3 to K result, inducing two maps\nfrom C(K 3 ) to C(K) and two maps on the cohomology, well-defined up to\noverall minus sign. We can guess that the categorification of J3 (K) is the\ntotal complex of the bicomplex\n0 \u2212\u2192 C(K3 ) \u2212\u2192 C(K) \u2295 C(K) \u2212\u2192 0.\nDenote the total complex by C3 (K) and its cohomology by H3 (K). We get a\nbigraded cohomology theory of knots with J3 (K) as the Euler characteristic.\nIndependence of H3 (K) from the choice of planar diagram is straightforward.\nTo categorify Jn (K) for arbitrary n we should look for a bicomplex built\nout of complexes C(K n\u22122k ) with binomial multiplicities as in (2), then form\nthe total complex and take its cohomology. This is done in Section 4, while\nthe representation-theoretic counterpart of this construction is worked out in\nthe next section.\n\n3\n\nA resolution of an irreducible sl(2) representation\n\nIn this section we give a homological interpretation of the formula\n\u230an\n\u230b\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2\nX\nn\u2212k\n\u2297(n\u22122k)\nk\n[Vn ] =\n[V1\n]\n(\u22121)\nk\nk=0\n\n8\n\n(7)\n\n\fdescribing the image of Vn in the Grothendieck group via those of tensor powers of the defining representation V1 . We consider the q = 1 case, so that Vn 's\nare representations of the Lie algebra sl(2). The case of generic q is identical\n(by substituting below \"q-antisymmetrization\" for \"antisymmetrization\").\nThe right hand side of (7) has alternating coefficients, due to (\u22121)k , and\nwe could try to\u0012realize\u0013it as the Euler characteristic of a complex. We put the\nn\u2212k\n\u2297(n\u22122k)\ncopies of V1\nin the k-th cohomological degree\ndirect sum of\nk\nand look for a natural differential\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f6\n\nn \u2212 k \u2212 1\uf8f8\nn \u2212 k\uf8f8\n\u2295\uf8ed\n\u2295\uf8ed\nd\n\u2297(n\u22122(k+1))\n\u2297(n\u22122k)\nk+1\nk\n\u2212\u2192 (V1\n)\n(V1\n)\nThe differential reduces the number of V1 's in each tensor power by 2. Since\nV1 \u2297 V1 \u223c\n= V0 \u2295 V2 , there is a unique, up to scaling, surjective homomorphism\nh : V1 \u2297 V1 \u2192 V0 , and it is simply the antisymmetrization. We will use h to\nconstruct the differential. \u0012\n\u0013\nn\u2212k\nThe binomial coefficient\nequals the number of ways to select k\nk\npairs of neighbours from n dots placed on a line, such that each dot appears\nin at most one pair (the n = 5, k = 2 example is depicted in figure 4). We\nwill call these k-pairings.\n\nFigure 4: All three 2-pairings of 5 dots\nNotice that the exponent in the tensor power of V1 is the number of dots\nwithout a partner (\"single\" dots). The differential goes in the direction of\nincreasing the number of pairs by 1. A new pair will consists of two adjacent\ndots, and the differential should contract the two corresponding powers of V1\ninto the trivial representation.\nTo formalize, let Ik be the set of k-pairings of n dots. For s \u2208 Ik let (s)\ndef\nbe the set of single dots in s, and V s = V \u2297(s) be the tensor product of V1 's,\none for each single dot. If s\u2032 \u2208 Ik+1 contains s (each pair in s is also a pair\n\u2032\nin s\u2032 ), there is a map hs\u2032 ,s : V s \u2192 V s given by contracting the two copies of\nV1 representing the only pair in s\u2032 \\ s. Consider a graph with with vertices\u2013\nelements of Ik , over all k = 0, 1, . . . , \u230a n2 \u230b, and arrows\u2013inclusions s \u2282 s\u2032 as\nabove. For n = 4 this graph is depicted in figure 5. Assigning V s to the\nvertex s and the map hs\u2032 ,s to the arrow from s to s\u2032 we obtain a commutative\ndiagram of sl(2) representations.\n9\n\n\fI2\n\nI1\n\nI0\n\nFigure 5: The n = 4 case\nWe make each square in the diagram anticommute by switching from hs\u2032 ,s\n\u2032\nto (\u22121)(s,s ) hs\u2032 ,s where (s, s\u2032 ) is the number of pairs in s to the left of the only\npair in s\u2032 \\ s. For each k take the direct sum of V s , for all s \u2208 Ik , and the\nsum of maps as above. The result is a complex, denoted Cn .\nExample: The complex C4 has the form\n0 \u2212\u2192 V1\u22974 \u2212\u2192 V1\u22972 \u2295 V1\u22972 \u2295 V1\u22972 \u2212\u2192 V0 \u2212\u2192 0,\nwith the differential\u2013the sum of arrows in figure 5, the top left arrow appearing with the minus sign.\nTheorem 1 The complex Cn is acyclic in non-zero degrees and its degree 0\ncohomology is the irreducible sl(2) representation Vn .\nProof: H 0 (Cn ) is the subrepresentation of V1\u2297n which is the kernel of\nd0 . This map is the sum of antisymmetrizations of two V1 's over all pairs of\nneighbours. Therefore, H 0 (Cn ) is isomorphic to the n-th symmetric power\nof V1 , and to Vn .\nTo prove exactness everywhere else, proceed by induction on n. The short\nexact sequence\n0 \u2212\u2192 Cn\u22122 [\u22121] \u2212\u2192 Cn \u2212\u2192 Cn\u22121 \u2297 V1 \u2212\u2192 0\n\n(8)\n\ncomes from separating all pairings of n dots into two types: the one where\nthe leftmost dot belongs to a pair, and the one where it does not. The sum\nof all first type selections is a subcomplex of Cn isomorphic to Cn\u22122 shifted\none degree to the right, the sum of all second type selections is a quotient\ncomplex of Cn isomorphic to Cn\u22121 \u2297 V1 .\n\n10\n\n\fInduction hypothesis and the long exact sequence of (8) imply H i (Cn ) = 0\nfor i > 1 and exactness of\n0 \u2212\u2192 H 0 (Cn ) \u2212\u2192 V1 \u2297 H 0 (Cn\u22121 ) \u2212\u2192 H 1 (Cn\u22122 [\u22121]) \u2212\u2192 H 1(Cn ) \u2212\u2192 0\nSubstituting Vm for H 0(Cm ), we get a short exact sequence\n0 \u2212\u2192 Vn \u2212\u2192 V1 \u2297 Vn\u22121 \u2212\u2192 Vn\u22122 \u2212\u2192 H 1 (Cn ) \u2212\u2192 0\ntelling us that H 1 (Cn ) = 0.\n\u0003\nRemark: Cn is a resolution of a simple module by a complex of semisimple\nmodules. This is different from the homological algebra framework, where\nwe usually resolve a module by a complex of projective, or injective, or flat\nmodules. The category of finite-dimensional sl(2) representations is already\nsemisimple, all additive functors from this category are exact, and there is\nno need for resolutions from the homological algebra viewpoint. However,\nCn seems to be interesting on it own.\n\n4\n\nCategorification of the colored Jones polynomial\n\nIn characteristic 2. To avoid the sign ambiguity, in this subsection we work\nin characteristic 2. Let F2 be the 2-element field. For a diagram D of a link,\nwe denote the complex C(D) \u2297Z F2 by C(D)2 and its cohomology by H(D)2 .\nStart with a framed oriented knot K and its plane diagram D. It gives\nrise to diagrams D n of cables K n . The cables are oriented as in figure 6, and,\nin a cross-section of D n , orientations alternate. Choose a cross-section of D n\nand enumerate the strands from left to right from 1 to n so that component\n1 is oriented in the same way as D, component 2 is oppositely oriented, etc.\nFor a pairing s \u2208 Ik denote by D s the cable diagram containing only\ncomponents corresponding to single dots (not in any pair) in s, and by K s\nthe corresponding link (it has n \u2212 2k components). Given an arrow s \u2192 s\u2032 ,\n\u2032\n\u2032\nthere is a canonical cobordism Sss from K s to K s given by \"contracting\" the\npair s\u2032 \\ s of neighbouring components of D s via an annulus. This cobordism\n\u2032\ninduces a well-defined (up to homotopy) map hs\u2032 ,s : C(D s )2 \u2212\u2192 C(D s )2 of\ncomplexes, and the induced map on cohomology (also denoted hs\u2032 ,s .)\nLet Cn (D)2 be the complex which in the k-th degree is the direct sum of\nH(D s )2 over all s \u2208 Ik . The differential is the sum of hs\u2032 ,s over all possible\narrows s \u2192 s\u2032 .\n11\n\n\f1\n2\n\nn\n\nFigure 6: Orientations\nDenote by Hn (D)2 the cohomology of Cn (D)2 . These groups are bigraded,\nHn (D)2 = \u2295 Hni,j (D)2 .\ni,j\u2208Z\n\nIf diagrams D and D \u2032 are related by a Reidemeister move II or III, the\ncomplexes Cn (D)2 and Cn (D \u2032 )2 are isomorphic. This implies\nProposition 1 Isomorphism classes of bigraded groups Hn (D)2 do not depend on the diagram D of a framed knot K, and are invariants of K. Their\nEuler characteristic is the colored Jones polynomial Jn (K).\nRemarks: These groups do not depend on the orientation of K.\nFrom knots to links. Given a colored link (L, n), we choose its diagram D, then do the above procedure for each component of L. The result is a multi-dimensional commutative diagram of groups H(D s )2 with\nmultiplicities\u2013products of binomials, for various pairings s and associated\ncables D s of D. Note that n = (n1 , . . . , nr ), and the pairing s = (s1 , . . . , sr )\nwhere si is a pairing of ni dots (equivalently, of ni cables of the i-th component). We collapse this commutative diagram into a complex, denoted\nCn (D)2 (in characteristic 2 a commutative square is anticommutative). Its\ncohomology groups do not depend on D, and are invariants of L. Their Euler\ncharacteristic is Jn (L).\nCobordisms. A cobordism in R4 between colored framed links can be\nrepresented by a sequence of its cross-sections, each a generic plane diagram\nof a colored framed link, with each two consequent cross-sections related\nby either a Reidemeister II or III move, or by a Morse move, see figure 7.\nComponents involved in a saddle point move should be colored by the same\nnumber, see figure 7.\nA Reidemeister II or III move from D to D0 induces an obvious isomorphism of groups H(D s )2 and H(D0s )2 and of complexes Cn (D)2 and Cn (D0 )2 .\n12\n\n\fn\nn\nBirth of a circle\n\nDeath of a circle\n\nn\n\nn\nn\n\nn\nSaddle point\n\nFigure 7: Morse moves of colored link diagrams\nThe unit and counit maps of A\u2297n induce natural maps between the complexes for the empty link and for the crossingless unknot diagram colored by\nn. We assign these maps to the \"birth\" and \"death\" Morse moves.\nSuppose that diagrams D and D0 are related by a saddle point move.\nConsider the case when the move merges two components of D (both labelled\nby n and denoted K1 and K2 ) into one component K of D0 , see figure 8.\nn\n\nn\n\nn\nK\n\nK1\n\nK2\n\nFigure 8: Merging two components into one\nWe would like to come up with a natural map \u03c8 of complexes\n\u03c8 : Cn (D)2 \u2212\u2192 Cn0 (D0 )2 ,\nwhere n0 is the coloring of D0 induced by the coloring n of D. As an abelian\ngroup, Cn (D)2 is the direct sum of H(D s )2 over all pairings s of n. Given\ns, let s1 and s2 be the pairings of n dots which are the restrictions of s to\n13\n\n\fs1\ns2\ncommon dot\n\nFigure 9: Two pairings with a common dot\nthe components K1 and K2 . Let k1 be the number of pairs in s1 and k2 the\nnumber of pairs in s2 .\nIf pairs in s1 and s2 have at least one common dot (see figure 9), we set\n\u03c8(H(D s )2 ) = 0. Otherwise, s1 and s2 are disjoint and their union s1 s2 is a\n(k1 + k2 )-pairing of n dots (see figure 10).\n\ns1\ns2\ns1s2\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nFigure 10: Disjoint union of pairings (in this example k1 = k2 = 1)\nTo such s we assign a pairing s0 of the n0 cable of D0 . This pairing is\nthe same as s on components of D0 that are unchanged during the saddle\npoint move, and s1 s2 on the component K colored by n. The map \u03c8 will take\nH(D s )2 to H(D0s0 )2 .\nA pair in s2 connects two dots numbered m and m + 1 for some m (in\nthe figure 10 example m = 5). For each such pair we apply the operator of\nmultiplication by X at strand m of K1s1 on the cohomology H(D s )2 (recall\nthat X is the generator of the ring A, and X 2 = 0). Likewise, for a pair in s1\nconnecting two dots numbered t and t + 1 (in the figure 10 example t = 2),\nwe apply the operator of multiplication by X at strand t of K2s2 . Denote\nby \u03c81 the product of these operators. \u03c81 is an endomorphism of H(D s )2 , a\nmultiplication by k1 + k2 copies of X at certain k1 + k2 strands of the cable\nDs .\n14\n\n\fFor each pair in s2 (connecting dots/strands numbered m and m + 1)\nconsider a thin annulus whose boundary is the union of two strands of K1s1\nlabelled m and m + 1. Similarly, for each pair in s1 (connecting two dots\nnumbered t and t + 1 for some t) consider a thin annulus whose boundary\nis the union of two strands of K2s2 labelled t and t + 1. Figure 12 depicts\nthese annuli schematically for our example. The resulting k1 + k2 annuli give\nrise to a cobordism from the cabled link with diagram D s to a cabled link\nwith 2(k1 + k2 ) fewer components, whose diagram D \u2032 can be produced by\nremoving these 2(k1 + k2 ) components (the \"mirror\" partners of pairs in s1\nand s2 ) from D s . This cobordism induces a map of cohomology groups from\nH(D s )2 to H(D \u2032 )2 , denoted \u03c82 .\nIn the diagram D \u2032 each strand in the cable K1s1 s2 has a matching strand in\nthe cable K2s1 s2 . There is a canonical cobordism from D \u2032 to D0s0 , the composition of saddle point cobordisms for each pair of identically numbered strands\nin K1s1 s2 and K2s1 s2 (that is, one saddle point cobordism for each dot not in\ns1 s2 ), for an example see figure 14. Denote by \u03c83 the map of cohomology\ngroups from H(D \u2032 )0 to H(D0s0 )0 induced by this composition of saddle point\ncobordisms.\nTo summarize, \u03c81 is the multiplication by a power of X at certains strands\nof the cable D s , \u03c82 is induced by annuli contraction cobordisms at \"mirrors\"\nof strand pairs in s1 and s2 , and \u03c83 is induced by saddle point cobordisms of\nthe remaining strands.\nLet \u03c8 = \u03c83 \u03c82 \u03c81 :\n\u03c81\n\n\u03c82\n\n\u03c83\n\n\u03c8 : H(D s )2 \u2212\u2192 H(D s )2 \u2212\u2192 H(D \u2032 )2 \u2212\u2192 H(D0s0 )2 .\nSumming over all pairings s of n we get a homomorphism of abelian groups\nfrom Cn (D)2 to Cn0 (D0 )2 .\nProposition 2 \u03c8 is a homomorphisms of complexes.\nProof is straightforward. \u0003\nFigures 11-14 illustrate our construction for the case of s1 and s2 in figure 10.\nA similar map \u03c8 can be defined for the case when a saddle point cobordism\nincreases (rather than decreases) the number of components by 1. We leave\nits construction to the reader.\nThus, to each Reidemeister and Morse move of framed colored link diagrams we can assign a map between the corresponding complexes Cn (D)2 .\nWe conjecture that the induced maps on cohomology of these complexes give\nan invariant of framed colored link cobordisms.\n15\n\n\f1 2\n\n3 4\n\nK\n\n5\n\n6\n\n6\n\n5\n\ns1\n\n4\n\nK\n\n1\n\n3 2\n\n1\n\ns2\n2\n\nFigure 11: Part of the diagram D s .

Let F be a field. For a diagram D of\na knot K denote by C(D)F the complex C(D) \u2297Z F and its cohomology by\nH(D)F .\nFor each arrow s \u2192 s\u2032 we have a map\n\u2032\n\nhs\u2032 ,s : H(D s )F \u2212\u2192 H(D s )F\nwell-defined up to overall minus sign.

This cobordism is a composition of saddle point cobordisms between matching pairs of\nstrands.\nLet us call a choice of signs in maps h satisfactory if all squares anticommute. If h is satisfactory, the direct sum of H(D s )F over all possible s with\ndifferential\u2013the sum of hs\u2032 ,s over all possible arrows s \u2192 s\u2032 forms a complex.\nDenote this complex by Cn,h (D)F .\nLemma 2 For any two satisfactory choices of signs h\u2032 , h\u2032\u2032 the complexes\nCn,h\u2032 (D)F and Cn,h\u2032\u2032 (D)F are isomorphic.\nProofs of these two lemmas are left to the reader. From lemmas 1 and 2\nwe derive that the cohomology groups of Cn,h (D)F do not depend on a satisfactory choice of signs. Denote these groups by Hn (D)F . Yet another exercise\nin sign juggling shows that a Reidemeister move induces an isomorphism of\nthese cohomology groups, and implies\nProposition 3 Isomorphism classes of bigraded cohomology groups Hn (D)F\nare invariants of the framed knot K. Their Euler characteristic is the colored\nJones polynomial:\nX\nJn (K) =\n(\u22121)i q j rk(Hni,j (K)F ).\ni,j\u2208Z\n\nRemark: Similar considerations work over Z, with the further complication that we cannot pass from the complex C(D s ) directly to its cohomology\n17\n\n\f(since Z is not a field), and will be forced to work with these complexes\nthroughout. Our diagrams will not be commutative or anticommutative, but\nrather commutative or anticommutative up to chain homotopy.\nDifferent definitions. There are several competing definitions of the\ncomplex whose cohomology categorify the colored Jones polynomial of a link.\nOur maps between complexes assigned to cables go in the direction of reducing the number of strands. We could set up these maps to go in the opposite\ndirection.\nFrom section 3 we know that the algebraic counterpart of the complex\nCn (K)F has cohomology only in degree 0. Taking the hint, we could downsize\nour complex\nd0\n0 \u2212\u2192 H(K n )F \u2212\u2192\n\u2295H(K n\u22122 )F \u2212\u2192 . . .\nby restricting to the subgroup ker(d0 ) of H(K n )F .\nThe above two modifications of Cn (K)F can be done independently, and\ngive rise to the total of four complexes (including Cn (K)F ). We conjecture\nthat if F has characteristic 0, these four complexes have isomorphic cohomology groups.\nExamples: (a) n = 2 case. We've observed in Section 2 that all four\ndefinitions give isomorphic theories over a field of characteristic different\nfrom 2.\n(b) n = 3 case over F2 . The differential in\nd\n\n0\n0 \u2212\u2192 H(D 3 )2 \u2212\u2192\nH(D)2 \u2295 H(D)2 \u2212\u2192 0\n\nis surjective, and the composition d0 \u25e6 d\u2032\u22121 is a permutation, where d\u2032\u22121 is the\ndifferential in\n0 \u2212\u2192 H(D)2 \u2295 H(D)2 \u2212\u2192 H(D 3 )2 \u2212\u2192 0.\nIt is easy to derive that all four definitions give isomorphic theories in this\ncase.\nIn yet another approach, we could consider an Sn -action on H(K n ) induced by permutations (braidings) of strands of the cable K n , and take the\nSn -invariants under this action. We expect that over Q this definition would\ngive the same result as each the previous four. One problem with this approach is the projectivity of the Sn -action, well-defined only up to sign.\n\n18\n\n\f5\n\nCategorification of the reduced colored Jones\npolynomial\n\nIn this section we categorify the reduced colored Jones polynomial Jen (L).\nLet's start with the case of a knot. Given a framed colored knot (K, n),\nthe Jones polynomial Jn (K) can be computed with the help of the Kauffman bracket rules and the Jones-Wenzl projector, see [2]. The Jones-Wenzl\nprojector is uniquely determined by graphical relations in figure 15.\n\nn\n\n=0\n\nn\n\n= [n + 1 ]\n\nFigure 15: The Jones-Wenzl projector\nWe denote the projector by pn and by p\u2032n the projector divided by [n + 1].\nIn this section we assume familiarity with [5] and, in particular, with\nthe ring H n and its indecomposable left projective modules Pa , for a \u2208 B n ,\nwhere B n is the set of crossingless matchings of 2n points. Positioning the\nJones-Wenzl projector in the upper half of the plane we can view it as a\nfunction from B n to Z[q, q \u22121 ], by coupling the projector to any crossingless\nmatching, as in figure 16.\nThe Jones-Wenzl projector evaluates to zero on any crossingless matching\nexcept for the one denoted e in figure 16, on which it takes value [n + 1].\nTherefore, p\u2032n is a \"delta-function\" on B n supported on e.\nIn [5] to any crossingless matching a \u2208 B n we assigned an indecomposable\nleft projective graded H n -module Pa , and to a tangle t with no bottom and\n2n top endpoints a complex of projective left H n -modules F (t), well-defined\nin the homotopy category Kn of complexes of graded H n -modules. To a\ntangle s with no top and 2n bottom endpoints we assigned a complex of\nprojective right H n -modules F (s). Coupling t with s corresponds to forming\nthe tensor product, F (st) \u223c\n= F (s) \u2297H n F (t).\nn\nFor each a \u2208 B there exists a right H n -module, denoted a Z, isomorphic\nas a graded abelian group to Z placed in degree 0, with the idempotent\n1a \u2208 H n acting as the identity on a Z, and other minimal idempotents acting\nby 0.

Therefore, in our categorification we can interpret the quotient\nJones-Wenzl projector p\u2032n as the right H n -module e Z. The ring H n has infinite homological dimension, and e Z does not have a finite length projective\nresolution. We do not know any explicit construction of a (necessarily infinite) projective resolution of e Z.\nRemark: For a similar categorification of the Jones-Wenzl projector pn\nwe should look for a graded H n -module which has a filtration with quotient\nmodules isomorphic to e Z{\u2212n}, e Z{\u2212n+2}, . . . , e Z{n}. Such a module does\nnot exist when n > 1.\nWe categorify the reduced colored Jones polynomial of a framed knot K\nwith the help of e Z.

Turn L into a tangle L\u2022 with no bottom and 2 top endpoints by cutting\na segment out of L\u2032 . Taking the n-cable of L\u2022 at the component L\u2032 gives us\na tangle, denoted Ln\u2022 , with no bottom and 2n top endpoints.\nApply the construction of section 4 to all components of Ln\u2022 other than\nthe n components coming from L\u2032 .

This ambiguity\nforced us into a clumsy definition of Hn (K)F , for a field F of characteristic\nother than 2, see section 4. No matter how we define Hn (L), taking care of\nsigns is a prerequisite for extending these homology groups to an invariant\nof (framed and colored) link cobordisms.\n(b) Cohomology theory described in section 4 depends nontrivially on\nthe framing, and is expected to give rise to invariants of framed cobordisms\nbetween framed links. To check the invariance, one needs a list of movie\nmoves for framed cobordisms.\n22\n\n\fOnce (a) and (b) have been dealt with, one can move on to the following\nproblem:\n(c) Give a clean definition of cohomology groups Hn (L), preferably over\nZ, and extend this construction to a functor from the category of (colored, framed, decorated) link cobordisms to the category of bigraded abelian\ngroups.\nHere are some other problems that we'd like to mention:\n(d) Establish equivalences between various definitions of cohomology groups\n(over Q) discussed at the end of section 4.\n(e) Extend the categorification of the reduced colored Jones polynomial\nto an invariant of (suitably decorated) link cobordisms.\n(f) Relate categorifications of the colored Jones polynomial and the reduced colored Jones polynomial.\nAcknowledgements.
