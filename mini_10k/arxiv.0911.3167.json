Unfortunately, laser cooling depends on the\nexistence of a closed few-level system, which does not\nexist for molecules, making quantum degeneracy harder\nto achieve. Nevertheless, due to large phase space density [2], photoassociation of Bose-condensed atoms can\nbe highly efficient, providing an end run around the\nneed for laser cooling of molecules. In the heteronuclear case [3, 4], photoassociation can thus serve as a bulk\nsource of dipolar molecules which, in turn, can be used\nin quantum computing applications [5] and simulations\nof condensed-matter systems [6].\nIn photoassociation [7, 8, 9], a colliding pair of atoms\nabsorbs a photon and makes a transition from the twoatom continuum to an bound molecular state. Since\none-photon transitions to the homonuclear ground state\nare dipole forbidden, these free-bound transitions occur\nto an electronically-excited state that undergoes spontaneous decay, typically on a time scale of tens of nanoseconds. To allow for fundamental studies and practical\napplications, a second laser is needed to drive population to the ground state [10, 11, 12]. However, Raman\nphotoassociation is limited in practice by unwanted dissociation [13], as well as the large frequency difference\nbetween the lasers that is required to target vibrational\nstables. So far, free-bound-ground photoassociation experiments have produced only a relatively small number\n\nof molecules in metastable high-lying levels [11].\nWe therefore consider photoassociation of a heteronuclear condensate, where the permanent electric dipole\nmoment of the daughter molecule enables transitions directly to the ground electro-vibrational state. High phase\nspace density not withstanding, excessive laser power is\nrequired in a one-photon scheme due to the the small size\nof the molecular state relative to the atom-pair state. A\nsecond photoassociation laser is then added to drive freebound transitions to an electronically-excited molecular\nstate, creating the \"ground-free-bound\" system shown\nin Fig. 1. The addition of the second photoassociation\nlaser creates an alternative path for reaching the electrovibrational ground state, leading to quantum interference\nand a dispersive-like shift of the free-ground resonance\nposition that depend on the free-bound laser intensity\nand detuning, as well as the size of both molecular states.\nNevertheless, strong enhancement does not guarantee coherent conversion to the electro-vibrational ground state,\nwhich occurs only for limited detunings near free-bound\nresonance. This scheme is analogous to laser-induced autoionization [14], and Feshbach-enhanced photoassociation [15, 16, 17, 18].\nThis Article is outlined as follows. In Sec. II, the\nmodel for ground-free-bound photoassociation of a BoseEinstein condensate of heteronuclear atoms is introduced, including photodissociation to noncondensate\natom pairs. Next, a steady-state solution is developed\nfor the noncondensate pair amplitude, leading to a crossmolecular coupling between the two, otherwise uncoupled, molecule states. Also, the rate equation is derived\nfor laser-enhanced photoassociation using the equivalent\nof the density matrix from quantum optics, and quantum\ninterference is discussed qualitatively. In Sec. III, the detuning and intensity position of the inteference node and\nlightshift are detailed, as well as enhanced saturation intensties, using LiNa as an example.

(c) Treating the noncondensate modes in the\nsteady-state approximation leads to an effective coupling between the two molecular states. (d) Similarly, for large freebound detuning, an effective two-level system emerges.\n\nversion to the electro-vibrational ground state is shown\nto take place in a finite window near the free-bound resonance. We conclude with Sec. IV.\n\nII.\n\nSTEADY-STATE MODEL\n\nConsider N1 atoms of mass m1 and N2 atoms of\nmass m1 that have each Bose-condensed into the zeromomentum state |0i, with N = N1 + N2 as the total\nnumber of atoms. The free-ground photoassociation laser\nthen destroys an atom from each species and creates a\ndipolar molecule of mass m3 = m1 + m2 in the J = 1\nrotational state of the electro-vibrational ground state,\n|1i, where transtions to the absolute ground state are\ndipole forbidden. The natural linewidth for this state is\n\u039301 , the atom-molecule Rabi coupling is \u03a91 , and the detuning \u03b401 < 0 indicates an open dissociation channel.\nSimilarly, the free-bound photoassociation laser creates\na molecule in the excited state |2i with natural linewidth\n\u039302 , where the atom-molecule coupling is \u03a92 and the detuning \u03b402 > 0 denotes an open dissociation channel. As\nper Fig. 1(a), this is the cascade system familiar from\nfew-level quantum optics with the intermediate state initially occupied. In the language of second quantization,\nannihilation of an atom (molecule) from the i-th atomic\n(molecular) condensate is represented by the operator ai\n(bi ). The Hamiltonian for the condensate modes is\ni\nXh\nH0\n=\n(\u22121)i \u03b40i \u2212 i\u03930i /2)b\u2020i bi\nh\u0304\ni\ni\n1 X h\n\u2212 \u221a\n\u03a9i a1 a2 b\u2020i + bi a\u20202 a\u20201 .\n2 N i\n\n(1a)\n\nTo be more precise, molecular dissociation to noncondensate levels should be included, as per Fig. 1(b). This\nsituation arises because a condensate molecule need not\ndissociate back to the atomic condensate, but may just\nas well create a pair of atoms with equal-and-opposite\nmomentum, since total momentum is conserved. Socalled rogue [13, 19], or unwanted [20], dissociation to\nnoncondensate modes therefore introduces the operators\nai,\u00b1k , along with the kinetic energy of a dissociated pair\nh\u0304\u03b5k = h\u03042 k 2 /2\u03bc of reduced mass 1/\u03bc = 1/m1 + 1/m2 .\nThe noncondensate Hamiltonian is\n\u0011\nX \u0010 \u2020\nH1\n=\n\u03b5k a1,k a1k + a\u20202,k a2k\nh\u0304\nk\n1 XX\n\u2212 \u221a\n\u03a9i fi,k (a1,k a2,\u2212k b\u2020i + bi a\u20202,\u2212k a\u20201,k ),\n2 N i k\n(1b)\nwhere fi,k accounts for the wavevector dependence of the\ni-th coupling to the noncondensate modes. Note that the\nfree term in H1 is an approximation that yields the correct mean-field equations to lowest order in the BBGKY\nhierarchy of correlation functions.\nTo obtain these mean-field equations, the Heisenberg\nequation of motion for a given operator, ih\u0304\u1e8b = [x, H],\nare derived from the Hamiltonian H = H0 + H1 given\nby Eqs. (1) and the operators are declared c-numbers.\nIn a minimalist model, x represents either the atomic\namplitude ai (molecular amplitude bi ), or the anomalous\ndensity, Ak = a1,k a2,\u2212k , which arises from photodissociation to noncondensate modes. The summation over k implicit to the Hamiltonian is then converted to an integral\nover frequency, introducing the frequency \u03c9\u03c1 = h\u0304\u03c12/3 /2\u03bc.\nThe resulting mean-field equations are\ni\u02271 = \u2212 21 a\u22172 (\u03a91 b1 + \u03a92 b2 ),\ni\u02272 =\ni\u1e03i =\n\n\u2212 12 a\u22171 (\u03a91 b1 + \u03a92 b2 ),\n\u0002\n\u0003\n(\u22121)i \u03b40i \u2212 i\u03930i /2 bi\n\n(2a)\n(2b)\n\u2212\n\n\u221a\nd\u03b5 \u03b5 fi (\u03b5)A(\u03b5),\nP\ni\u0226(\u03b5) = \u03b5A(\u03b5) \u2212 21 i \u03a9i fi (\u03b5)bi ,\n\u2212 21 \u03bei\n\n1\n2 \u03a9i a1 a2\n\nZ\n\n(2c)\n(2d)\n\n\u221a\nwhere the amplitudes have been scaled by a factor of N\nand are now of order unity, the ith atom-molecule cou\u221a\npling is Bose-enhanced, \u03a9i \u221d \u03c1, and the rogue coupling\n3/2\nis 4\u03c0\u03bei = \u03a9i /\u03c9\u03c1 . The frequency dependence of the\nith atom-molecule coupling is modeled with a Gaussian,\nfi (\u03b5) = exp(\u2212\u03b52 /2\u03b2i2 ), where the width of the coupling,\n\u03b2i , is determined by the semi-classical size of the i-th\nmolecule state, \u03b2i = h\u0304/(2\u03bcL2i ).\nBorrowing from quantum optics, the simplest nontrival way to include noncondensate modes is to treat the\nanomalous amplitude in the steady-state approximation,\n\n\f3\ncoherence, \u010a0i \u2248 0, the rate equation for the probability\nof the ith atomic condensate is given by\n\n\u0226 \u2248 0.

Borrowing intuition from quantum optics, once\nthe two molecular states are coupled by the shared photodissociation continuum, this suppression and enhancement is due to quantum interference between photoassociation directly to the electro-vibrational ground state\nand photoassociation to the electro-vibrational ground\nstate via the electro-excited molecular state.\nIII.\n\nEXPLICIT RESULTS\n\nFor concreteness, we consider explicit numbers for\nLiNa. The rate constant for resonant free-ground photoassociation alone is\n\u03c1K1 =\n\nwhere the two-photon atom-molecule coupling is \u03c7 =\n\u03a91 + 12 L\u03b42 \u03a92 /\u03a93 , the Stark-shifted detuning is \u03bd =\n\u03b41 + 14 L\u03b42 , and the effective damping is \u0393 = \u03931 + 14 L\u03932 ,\nwhere L = \u03a923 /[\u03b422 + \u039322 /4]. Since \u03932 \u001d [\u03a922 /(4\u03b42 )]|ai |2 ,\nwe neglect the resonant mean-field shift compared to the\nnatural linewidth of the excited molecular state, except\nto define the resonant intercondensate scattering length,\n\u03c11/3 ar = \u2212\u03a922 /(8\u03c0\u03c9\u03c1 \u03b42 ).\nTo derive an expression for the rate constant, we define\nthe atomic and molecular probabilities, Pi = a\u2217i ai and\nP0 = 2b\u22171 b1 , as well as the atom-molecule \"coherence\"\nC0i = ai b\u22171 . Making extensive use of the product rule,\ne.g., i\u010a0i = iai ai \u1e03\u22171 + 2iai \u0227i b\u22171 , we have\n\u2217\ni\u1e56i = \u03c7(C0i \u2212 C0i\n),\n\n1 \u03c72 /\u0393\nP1 P2 .\n4 \u03bd 2 + \u03932 /4\n\n(3c)\n\nwhere \u03b4i = \u03b40i \u2212 (\u22121)i \u03c30i and \u0393i = \u03930i + \u03b3i . The shift of\nlaser resonance is \u03c30i = <[\u03a3i ], and the photodissociation\nrate is \u03b3i = =[\u03a3i ], where\nZ\n\u221a f 2 (\u03b5)\n\u03a3i = lim 14 \u03a9i \u03bei d\u03b5 \u03b5 i\n.\n(4a)\n\u03c9\u21920\n(\u03b5 \u2212 \u03c9)\n\nia \u03071 = \u2212\n\n\u1e56i =\n\n\u03a921\n.\n\u039301 + \u03b31\n\n(8)\n\nIn\n\u221a the low intensity limit \u03b31 \u001c \u039301 , so that \u03a91 =\n\u03c1K1 \u03930 . Borrowing from Ref. [17], the unit-intensity\nrate constant for 100 nK [21] transitions to the J = 1\nrotational state in the electro-vibrational ground state of\nLiNa is K1 = 5.5 \u00d7 10\u221215 cm3 /s. Estimating the natural linewidth \u039301 = 12 \u00d7 2\u03c0 mHz, the free-ground Rabi\ncoupling is \u03a91 = 3.2 \u00d7 2\u03c0 mHz for I1 = 1 W/cm2 and\n\u03c1 = 1012 cm\u22123 . The free-bound coupling\nfor the electrop\nexcited molecular state, \u03a92 = \u03a902 I/I02 , is estimated\nby mass scaling those for homonuclear Li [16, 22]: \u03a902 =\n44 \u00d7 2\u03c0 kHz/(W/cm2 )1/2 , I02 = 43 W/cm2 , L2 = 133a0 ,\nand \u039302 = 12 \u00d7 2\u03c0 MHz. Finally, for Gaussian\nfi (\u03b5), the\np\ncross-molecular coupling is \u03a93 = \u03b7\u03a91 \u03a92 \u03b2/\u03c9\u03c1 /(4\u03c0\u03c9\u03c1 ),\nwhere \u03b7 is a dimensionless constant of order unity leftover\nfrom integrating\nthe two Gaussians, and \u03b2 = h\u0304/(2\u03bc)L2\np\n4\n4\nwith L = L1 + L42 . Hence, away from the free-bound\nresonance and on lightshifted resonance (\u03bd = 0), the rate\nconstant is then\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\u00152\n1\n\u03a922\n\u03a921 1 + \u03b7\n8\u03c0\u03c9\u03c1 \u03b42\n\u03c11/3 L\n\u03c1K =\n, (9)\n\u0014 \u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012 \u0013\u00152\n2\n1\n\u03a92\n\u03a91\n\u03931 + \u03b7\n\u0393\n2\n8\u03c0\u03c9\u03c1 \u03b42\n\u03a92\n\u03c11/3 L\nwhere \u03931 \u2248 \u039301 for free-ground intensities herein.\n\n\f4\nA.\n\nDestructive Interference\n\nConsidering the node, for fixed free-bound laser intensity photoassociation ceases for the free-bound detuning\n\u03b4N 2\n\u03b7 \u03a922 1/3\n=\u2212\n\u03c1 L.\n\u0393s\n8\u03c0 \u03c9\u03c1 \u0393s\n\n(10a)\n\nOn p\nthe other hand, for fixed laser detuning and \u03a9i =\n\u03a90i Ii /I0i , where I0i is a characteristic intensity for the\ngiven transition, then the intensity position of the destructive interference node is\nIN 2\n8\u03c0 \u03c9\u03c1 \u03b42 1/3\n\u03c1 L,\n=\u2212\nI02\n\u03b7 \u03a9202\n\nConstructive Interference\n\nEnhanced or not, the rate constant is linear for low\nfree-ground intensity and saturates to a constant value\nfor large free-ground intensity.

Although still\nsomewhat large, this result is an improvement to I01 of\nthree orders of magnitude. Further results are shown in\nFig. 3, illustrating the dependence on free-bound detuning and intensity.

However, the laser-enhanced freeground rate constant is nearly 10\u221211 cm3 /s [Fig 2(a)],\nrepresenting an enhancement of more than three orders\nof magnitude over one-color alone. Quantum enhancement via the shared continuum might therefore bring saturation of free-ground transitions closer to the realm of\nobservability.

Near the free-bound resonance, the excited state dominates and the position of\nfree-ground resonance is to the blue, with a nodal position that depends on the detuning and intensity of the\nfree-bound laser, as well as the the semi-classical size of\nboth molecular states. The excited state contribution is\nto the blue because it takes extra energy to break up the\nexcited-state molecule.\nQuantitatively, up to an factor of 1/(\u03b7L1 /L), the light\nshift vanishes for a critical detuning given by Eq. (10a),\nand a critical intensity given by Eq. (10b). Typical results for LiNa are shown in Fig. 4. The difference in the\nposition of the rate and lightshift nodes is due to the assumedly different sizes of the molecular states. In particular, the difference is due to the physical constraint that\nthe size of the ground state is much less than the size of\nthe excited state\u2013if the roles are reversed, the positions\nof the nodes are roughly identical since 1/\u03b7 \u223c 1.\n\nD.\n\n\u2212\u03a922 /(8\u03c0\u03c9\u03c1 \u03b42 ).

Lastly, the dependence on the free-bound laser intensity and detuning is\nnow readily understood, since these are two means by\nwhich the scattering length can be tuned with photoassociation [24, 25, 26].\n\nComparison to Collisional Models\nE.\n\nBridging to collisional models, the laser-induced resonant scattering length is again defined by \u03c11/3 ar =\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n-1\n\n!1/!01\n\n5\n\n-30\n\n(13)\n\n-20\n-10\n\"2/#02\n\n0\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10 15 20\nI2 [W/cm2]\n\nFIG. 4: Dispersive-like lightshift in heteronuclear free-ground\nphotoassociation of a joint Li-Na Bose-Einstein condensate,\nwhere the free-ground laser intensity is 1 W/cm2 and the size\nof the ground molecular state is estimated as L1 /L2 = 10.

Indeed, given that the enhanced free-ground\nrate constant saturates near-resonance at the rate for\nfree-bound photoassociation alone, the question arises\nwhether the conversion to ground state molecules is coherent, or whether the molecules decay as fast as\u2013or\nfaster than\u2013they are made. Borrowing yet again from\nquantum optics, coherence is reached when the Rabi coupling is large compared to the damping rate, |\u03c7|/\u0393 \u001d 1.\nUsing the collisional expression for its economy, the coherence factor is\n\u0010\nar \u0011\n\u03a9\n1\n\u2212\n\u03b7\n1\n\u03c7\nL\n=\n.\n(15)\n\u0012\n\u00132\n\u0393\nar \u03a91\n\u03931 + \u03b7\n\u03932\nL \u03a92\nResults for LiNa are shown in Fig. 5.

While independent of the free-ground laser parameters, elimination\nand enhancement of the free-ground rate constant depends on the detuning and intensity of the free-bound\nlaser, as well as the semi-classical size of both molecular\nstates. Similarly, the cross-molecular coupling leads to\na dispersive-like shift of the free-ground resonance position, which is also independent of the free-ground laser\nparameters, but does depend on the free-bound laser parameters and the size of both molecular states. Finally,\nalthough enhancement of the free-ground rate constant\ntops three orders of magnitude, there is only a small\nrange in free-bound detuning where coherent conversion\nto ground state molecules is possible.\nBesides an all-optical route to enhanced coherent conversion from heteronuclear atoms to dipolar molecules\nin the electro-vibrational ground state, the significance\nof the present work is elucidation of the role played\nby both molecular state sizes, and the subsequent contrast with the analogous Feshbach-enhanced photoassociation [15, 16, 17, 18]. In the case of Feshbach-enhanced\nfree-bound transitions to an excited state [15, 16, 18],\nthe rate constant vanishes and the anomalous lightshift\nchanges from red to blue at roughly the same magnetic\nfield detuning, whereas here we find that rate constant\nvanishes and the anomalous lightshift changes sign at\nvery different values. Based on the present results, this\ndifferential is due to an enhancing state that is much\nsmaller (larger) than the target state in the magnetooptical (all-optical) system. Comparison to the magnetooptical heteronuclear case is difficult, since the results\nof Ref. [17] are not explicit with respect to the size\nof the molecules. Nevertheless, the results herein provide a roadmap to a broader understanding of Feshbachenhanced free-ground photoassociation to the heteronuclear electro-vibrational ground state.\n\nCONCLUSION\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe have investigated ground-free-bound photoassociation of a heteronuclear Bose-Einstein condensate of\natoms into dipolar molecules in the J = 1 electrovibrational ground state. Coupling the additional state\nto the continuum leads to a cross-coupling between the\npreviously uncoupled molecules, which allows an alternate pathway for transitions to the ground molecular\n\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge helpful conversations with Bill Stwalley, support from NSF (MM,\n00900698), and a Diamond Research Scholarship from\nTemple University's Office of the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Affairs (CD).\n\n[1] E.
