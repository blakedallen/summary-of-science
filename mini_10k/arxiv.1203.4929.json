Introduction\nOver the past few decades physics of quantum dots (QDs) has become a focal point of research in nanoelectronics.\nThe introduction of the \"Universal Hamiltonian\" [1, 2, 3, 4] has made it possible to take into account the effects of\nelectron-electron (e-e) interaction within a quantum dot (QD) in a controlled way. This approach is applicable for\na normal-metal QD in the metallic regime when the Thouless energy ET h and the mean single particle level spacing\n\u03b4 satisfy g \u2261 ET h /\u03b4 \u001d 1 (g is the dimensionless conductance). Within this scheme interactions are split into a sum\nof three spatially independent contributions in the charging, spin-exchange, and Cooper channels. The charging term\n\n\fSaha, Gefen, Burmistrov, Shnirman and Altland / Annals of Physics 00 (2018) 1\u201316\n\n2\n\nB\n\u03b4\n\n\u04240\n\nFigure 1: (Color online) Cartoon scheme of an isolated QD . Here \u03b4 is the single particle level spacing, \u03a60 is the zero component of the auxiliary\nHS vector bosonic field, and B is the applied magnetic field.\n\nleads to the phenomenon of Coulomb blockade, while the spin-exchange term can drive the system towards the Stoner\ninstability [5].\nIn bulk systems the exchange interaction competes with the kinetic energy leading to Stoner instability. In finite\nsize systems mesoscopic Stoner regime may be a precursor of bulk thermodynamic Stoner Instability [1]. More\nprecisely, one distinguishes three regimes depending on the strength of the exchange interaction: (a) a phase with\nthe total spin of the dot equal zero, (b) the mesoscopic Stoner regime in which the total spin of the dot is finite but\nnot proportional to the volume of the dot, and (c) the thermodynamic ferromagnetic phase where magnetization is\nproportional to the volume. The mesoscopic Stoner regime can be realized in QDs made of materials close to the\nthermodynamic Stoner instability, e.g., Co impurities in Pd or Pt host, Fe dissolved in various transition metal alloys,\nNi impurities in Pd host, and Co in Fe grains, as well as new nearly ferromagnetic rare earth materials [6, 7, 8].\nNotably, the inclusion of the spin-exchange turned out to be non-trivial as the resulting path integral action is\nnon-Abelian [9, 10]. To understand the complexity of the problem we compare with the case when only the charging\ninteraction is taken into account [11, 12, 13]. It was suggested by Kamenev and Gefen [11] to take the following\nsteps in solving that problem: (a) start from a fermionic action which includes an e-e interaction term quartic in the\nfermionic Grassman variables, (b) perform a Hubbard-Stratonovich (HS) transformation by introducing an auxiliary\nbosonic field, (c) perform a gauge transformation over the Grassman variables which makes all the non-zero Matsubara\ncomponents of the (HS) field decouple from the fermionic fields in the action, and, finally, (d) integrate out the\nfermions. The resulting, purely bosonic action, is quadratic in the bosonic non-zero Matsubara components, which\nrenders the problem easily solvable. The trick of gauge-integrating over Grassman variables does not work for the\nnon-abelian case [9], so that an alternative approach is needed.\nThere have been several attempts to account for charge and spin interactions in a QD including a rate equation\nanalysis [14, 15] and a perturbative expansion [9]. Alhassid and Rupp [14] have analyzed some aspects of the problem\nexactly. More recently an exact solution of the isotropic spin interaction model based on the generalized Wei-NormanKolokolov method [16] has been presented [10]. In this exact solution several observables, including the tunneling\ndensity of states and magnetic susceptibility have been calculated below the Stoner instability point for an equidistant\nspectrum. The effects of disorder have been addressed in Ref [17]. The tunneling density of states exhibits a nonmonotonous behavior as a function of energy, and the magnetic susceptibility emerges out to be a sum of Pauli and\nCurie like terms.\nIn this article we present an approximative geometric approach to tackle the isotropic spin-exchange model. Our\nresults are in agreement with the exact results [10] for the partition function and the magnetic susceptibility within\n\n\fSaha, Gefen, Burmistrov, Shnirman and Altland / Annals of Physics 00 (2018) 1\u201316\n\n3\n\nthe mesoscopic Stoner instability regime. Our rationale behind developing an approximation scheme, given the exact\nsolution, is the high complexity and inflexibility of the exact method. We thus expect to be able to apply our geometric\napproach in cases where the exact method is inapplicable or too complicated. These should cover a broad range of\nproblems involving spin transport through QD coupled to normal leads and through an array of QDs .\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Sec.2 we consider an isolated QD with isotropic exchange interaction,\nand derive an effective action in terms of an auxiliary HS bosonic vector field. In Sec.3 we perform a perturbative\nexpansion of our effective action in powers of the Berry's connection operator, and show that in the lowest order\nof this expansion the Berry phase governs the effective action. In Sec.4 we calculate the partition function and the\nmagnetic susceptibility of the QD , and discuss the effect of Berry phase on susceptibility. Sec.5 contains a summary\nof our analysis. In the appendices (A, B and C) we present alternative methods of calculation, which provide further\njustification of our results.\n2. Hamiltonian and Effective action\nIn this section we perform a HS transformation and obtain the effective action in terms of an auxiliary HS bosonic\n~ We, then perform a unitary rotation R to the instantaneous direction of \u03a6\n~ and rewrite the effective\nvector field \u03a6.\n\u22121\naction in terms of the Berry connection operator R \u1e58. Finally, integrating out the fermions we obtain the effective\naction of the isolated QD in terms of the zero component of the HS field and R\u22121 \u1e58.\nA quantum dot in the metallic regime, g \u001d 1, is described by the universal Hamiltonian [1]:\nH = H0 + HC + H J + H\u03bb .\n\n(1)\n\nThe noninteracting part of the universal Hamiltonian reads\nX\nH0 =\n\u000f\u03b1 a\u2020\u03b1,\u03c3 a\u03b1,\u03c3 ,\n\n(2)\n\n\u03b1,\u03c3\n\nwhere \u000f\u03b1 denotes the energy of a spin-degenerate (index \u03c3) single particle level \u03b1. The charging interaction term\n\u0010\n\u00112\nHC = EC N\u0302 \u2212 N0\n(3)\naccounts for the Coulomb blockade. Here, EC denotes the charging energy of the QD, N0 represents the background\nP\ncharge, and N\u0302 = \u03b1,\u03c3 a\u2020\u03b1,\u03c3 a\u03b1,\u03c3 is the operator of the total number of electrons of the dot. For the isolated QD the total\nnumber of electrons is fixed and, therefore, the charging interaction term can be omitted. The term\n2\n\nH J = \u2212J \u015c\n\n(4)\n\nrepresents the ferromagnetic (J > 0) exchange interaction within the dot where \u015c = \u03b1 a\u2020\u03b1,\u03c31 S\u03c31 \u03c32 a\u03b1,\u03c32 is the operator\n~ = (\u03c3 x , \u03c3y , \u03c3z ) is a vector made of Pauli matrices.

For the dots fabricated in 2D electron gas\nthe interaction in the Cooper channel is typically repulsive and, therefore, renormalizes to zero [2]. In the case of 3D\nquantum dots realized as small metallic grains, the interaction in the Cooper channel can be attractive, giving rise to\ninteresting competition between superconductivity and ferromagnetism [18, 19, 20].

The resulting bosonic action in Eq.9 is non-abelian due to the non commutativity of the Pauli matrices.\nNote that the problem is 'isotropic' in the sense that the outcome should not depend on the initial and final direction\nof ~n.\nWe are guided by the idea that close to Stoner instability the amplitude of the exchange field \u03a6 is large, i.e., a\n~ \u223c JS). In that situation one can distinguish between the adiabatic and the\nlarge total spin develops on the dot (\u03a6\n~\nnon-adiabatic paths of \u03a6(\u03c4).\nThe former involve Matsubara frequencies such that |\u03c9m | \u001c \u03a6. We argue that the nonadiabatic paths do not contribute considerably to the partition function (except for providing for proper normalization),\n~ Hence, we concentrate on the adiabatic paths and\nsince the electrons do not manage to react to the fast changes of \u03a6.\nperform an expansion in the time variation of ~n.

[11], think of R as being applied to the fermionic field. That is,\none first introduces \u03a80\u03b1 via \u03a8\u03b1 = R\u03a80\u03b1 and, then, integrates over \u03a80\u03b1 . In this case it is convenient to choose the gauge\n\u03c8 so that R remains periodic in Matsubara time upon a continuous change of \u03c6 to \u03c6 + 2\u03c0. Then \u03a80\u03b1 is anti-periodic as\nit should be. This can be achieved, e.g., by fixing the gauge as \u03c8(\u03c4) = \u2212\u03c6(\u03c4). In what follows we work in this gauge.\nNext, we represent the amplitude of the exchange field as a sum of its zero frequency component and of the\nR\u03b2\nrest, \u03a6(\u03c4) = \u03a60 + \u03b4\u03a6(\u03c4), such that \u03b4\u03a6(\u03c4)d\u03c4 = 0.

Thus, at these frequencies the system reduces to a large\nspin of amplitude \u223c \u0393. Indeed the last term of the action (29) is just the well known Wess-Zumino action of a free spin.\nWhile a partition function of a true free spin is trivial to calculate, our spin \"lives\" only at the adiabatic frequencies.\nWe, thus, define our functional integral for the partition function as an integral over all paths whose frequency scale\nis cut off by \u03a60 .

Calculating the path integral\nWe are guided by the idea that the most important paths are those of almost constant radius \u03a6(\u03c4) \u2248 \u03a60 . Indeed,\nas can be seen from (29) the longitudinal fluctuations \u03b4\u03a6 are suppressed by a factor containing the bare J. By\ncontrast, close to the Stoner instability, the zero frequency amplitude \u03a60 is only weakly suppressed (J \u2217 \u001d J). The\nlarger is \u03a60 , the bigger is the phase volume of possible transverse fluctuations. The latter are only \"penalized\" by\nthe Berry phase term. An entropic \"phase space\" argument, outlined above, reveals that \u03a60 should assume\n\u221a a large\n\u2217\nT J and\nvalue.

Since \u0393 \u223c \u03bd\u03a60 \u001d 1 (this has to be checked for self consistently), these solid angles must remain small, and we\ncan restrict ourself to a Gaussian expansion around a static value of ~n, namely ~n0 , the relevant paths will be given by\nthe small variations around this static ~n0 .

(39)) dominates when\nT \u001d J \u2217 . In the low temperature\nregime, T \u001c J \u2217 , the Curie-like part (second term) dominates. In this regime\n\u221a\n2\nthe average spins scales as < S > \u223c J \u2217 /\u03b4. This Curie like contribution in the magnetic response can be tested in\nmaterials close to the Stoner instability such as Pd (J/\u03b4 = 0.83) or YFe2 Zn20 (J/\u03b4 = 0.94) [8]. It is important to\nunderstand that the Curie part of the susceptibility represents a mesoscopic effect. The density of states of a QD \u03bd\nscales linearly with the volume of the dot, \u03bd \u223c V. On the other hand J \u223c 1/V. Hence the Pauli like part of the\nmagnetic susceptibility is proportional to the volume V and is an extensive quantity. On the other hand, the Curie\nsusceptibility is intensive as \u03bdJ is scale invariant. Therefore for a fixed temperature T , if one gradually increases\nthe size of the system, the Pauli part grows and, eventually, the Curie susceptibility becomes negligible compared to\nthe Pauli one. This behavior is shown in Fig.2(a) where \u03bdJ is chosen to be in close vicinity of the Stoner instability\nregime. To illustrate the nature of Pauli and Curie like suceptibility more, we show their behavior as a function of\nthe Stoner parameter \u03bdJ in Fig. 2(b). It is clear that for a fixed dimensionless parameter \u03b2J, the Curie susceptibility\n(green curve) becomes more dominant over the Pauli one (red curve) as we approach towards the Stoner instability\npoint. On the other hand, the blue curve shows the behavior of J\u03c7exact which in close vicinity to the Stoner instability\npoint matches quite well to our approximate answear (Eq. (39)), shown by the magenta curve in Fig. 2(b).\n\n\fSaha, Gefen, Burmistrov, Shnirman and Altland / Annals of Physics 00 (2018) 1\u201316\n\n50\n\nJ\u03c7\n\n40\n30\n\n10\n\n(b)\n\nJ\u03c7\nPauli\nJ\u03c7\nCurie\nJ\u03c7 Eq.39\nJ\u03c7 Exact\n\u03b2 J=1.0\n\n20\n10\n0\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n0.85\n\n0.95\n\n\u03bdJ\nFigure 2: (Color online) (a) Magnetic susceptibility of an isolated QD in the T \u2212 V plane where T is the temperature and V is the volume of the\nbackground 3D material.

In the path integral\nHS formulation this problem leads to an effective non-abelian action. Here we have presented an approximative\ngeometric approach in which the Berry phase controls the dynamics of the direction ~n of the HS magnetization vector\n\n~ Close to the Stoner limit, i.e., for \u03bdJ \u2192 1, our approach reproduces well the exact solution of Ref. [10] which\n\u03a6.\ncomes at the expense of a hard calculation based on the generalized Wei-Norman-Kolokolov method [16]. Note\nthat even zero frequency observables (for e.g. susceptibility), involve summation over finite frequency fluctuations\n(Eq. (B.14)), including both low and high frequency contributions. Although the exact result describes both the low\nand high energy contents of susceptibility, we here show that if one is interested in the low energy regime of long\nrange fluctuations, the information of the exact result can be obtained from our physically motivated and user friendly\napproach of the invariant action. However if one insists on knowing ultraviolett behavior, then one may resort to an\nequally simple gaussian expansion around stationary points. Hence, our approximative geometric approach covers\nmuch of the contents of the observable, in a manner suitable for further generalization. Therefore, we believe that\nthis approach could be very useful in situations in which the exact method is inapplicable. These may be, e.g., the\nproblems of charge and spin transport via quantum dots coupled to normal or ferromagnetic leads.\nStrictly speaking our results are valid for \u03b4 = \u03bd\u22121 \u223c J < T < J \u2217 . Yet, for the equidistant spectrum assumed in this\npaper we do not expect major changes at lower temperatures. In the presence of disorder the low temperature regime\nT < J \u2217 is itself more subtle [17].\nFinally, it is important to mention that, as discussed around Eq. (20), disorder can influence the grand canonical\npotential of non-interacting electrons \u03a90 quite essentially. Yet, it is easy to show that the Berry phase part of the action\nis quite insensitive to disorder.\n6.

We observe that the longitudinal part of \u03b7 of\n(A.2), which is responsible for the Berry phase term in the action, does not contain the operators V, V \u22121 and, thus,\nis not influenced by the longitudinal fluctuations \u03b4\u03a6 which appear only in the factor \u03be. Moreover, substituting \u03b7 of\n(A.2) into Eq. (26) we observe that in the adiabatic limit the longitudinal fluctuations drop out also in the second order\nterms. Thus, disregarding the longitudinal fluctuations in (13), and the factor V altogether, was justified.\nAppendix B.

The advantage is\nthe higher level of accuracy in handling the integration measure.

Thus it is not necessary to subtract\nanything at high frequencies.\n(B) \u03c9m \u001c \u03a60\nIn this limit, after the subtraction of the second term of the RHS of (B.14) and retaining only transverse fluctuations we obtain\nX \u03b2\u0393\u03c9m \uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8ec \u03b4\u03a6 x,m \u03b4\u03a6y,\u2212m \u2212 \u03b4\u03a6y,m \u03b4\u03a6 x,\u2212m \uf8f6\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8\nS\u03b4\u03a6\u22a5 = \u2212\n2\n\u03a620\nm>0\nX \u03b2\u0393\u03c92 \uf8eb\uf8ec\uf8ec \u03b4\u03a6 x,m \u03b4\u03a6 x,\u2212m + \u03b4\u03a6y,m \u03b4\u03a6y,\u2212m \uf8f6\uf8f7\uf8f7\nm \uf8ec\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 .\n\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\u2212\n(B.17)\n2\u03a6\n\u03a620\n0\nm>0\nIn the time representation Eq.B.17 reads\nS\u03b4\u03a6\u22a5\n\ni\u0393\n=\n2\n\nZ\u03b2\nd\u03c4\n0\n\n\u03b4\u03a6\u0307 x \u03b4\u03a6y\n\u03a620\n\n\u0393\n\u2212\n4\u03a60\n\nZ\u03b2\nd\u03c4\n0\n\n(\u03b4\u03a6\u0307 x )2 + (\u03b4\u03a6\u0307y )2\n\u03a620\n\n.\n\n(B.18)\n\nThe first term in Eq.B.18 is equal to the Berry phase term (23). The second term is of the second order in\nderivatives and can be rewritten as\nZ\u03b2\n\u0393\n\u2212\nd\u03c4 (~n \u0307 )2 ,\n(B.19)\n4\u03a60\n0\n\n\fSaha, Gefen, Burmistrov, Shnirman and Altland / Annals of Physics 00 (2018) 1\u201316\n\n15\n\n~ Thus we reproduce the second order term (27). Since the\nwhere ~n is the unit vector in the direction of \u03a6.\nobtained action is local in time and is proportional to the time derivatives, the fact that we started from an\n~ 0 is no longer important. Indeed, we can always choose the\nexpansion in small fluctuations around a given \u03a6\n~\n~\ndirection of \u03a60 close to the \"current\" \u03a6(\u03c4).\nAppendix B.4.

QD in presence of an external magnetic field B\nHere we provide an alternative derivation of the susceptibility by considering the isolated QD in a weak magnetic\nfield.
