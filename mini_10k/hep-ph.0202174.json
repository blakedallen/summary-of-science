Leibovich and David Rainwater\nTheory Dept., Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, Batavia, IL, USA\n\nAbstract\nLight bottom squarks and gluinos have been invoked to explain the b quark pair\nproduction excess at the Tevatron. We investigate the associated production of tt\u0304bb\u0304 at\nhadron colliders in this scenario, and find that the rates for this process are enhanced\nover the Standard Model prediction. If light gluinos exist, it may be possible to detect\nthem at the Tevatron, and they could easily be observed at the Large Hadron Collider.\n\nThe bottom quark pair production cross section measured at the Fermilab Tevatron exceeds the\ntheoretical prediction by about a factor of two [1]. The state of the art theoretical prediction is\ncurrently next-to-leading (NLO) order in QCD. While the NLO corrections are large, it is possible\nthat the measured excess is due to new physics [2].\nBerger et al. [3] propose a solution to this puzzle based on low-energy supersymmetry (LESS) [4].\nIn particular, they proposed the existence of a light gluino, g\u0303, with mass mg\u0303 \u2248 12 \u2212 16 GeV, which\ndecays to a bottom quark and light bottom squark, b\u03031 , of mass mb\u03031 \u2248 2 \u2212 5.5 GeV. The bottom squark\nis either long lived or decays hadronically. It is argued that this scenario is not yet ruled out by other\nexperiments [5,6].\nOne way to test the above scenario is via observation of the final state tt\u0304bb\u0304. With LESS, there is\nthe new production channel tt\u0304g\u0303g\u0303, with the gluinos decaying immediately to bb\u03031 . If the bottom squark\ndecays hadronically, the decay products are typically merged with those of the associated b quark\njet. If instead the bottom squarks are long-lived, the event signature is still two additional bottom\nquarks in top quark pair production. One would expect the rate for this new channel to be larger than\nthe Standard Model (SM) tt\u0304bb\u0304 rate due to the large Casimir. Looking for LESS in this manner has\nmany nice properties. Unlike for \u03a5 [7] or B [8] meson decays, we do not need to worry about nonperturbative physics. Furthermore, the scale dependence for top quark pair associated production is\nmuch smaller than for bottom quark pair production. Finally, unlike many supersymmetric searches,\nwith this production channel there is almost no model dependence. As the production coupling\ninvolved is that of QCD, \u03b1s , to a first approximation the only LESS model parameter which enters\nat leading order is the gluino mass, mg\u0303 (inclusion of top squarks leads to additional diagrams, but\nthese are suppressed primarily due to the additional heavy propagators). One could also choose to\nexamine other associated production processes, such as Z g\u0303g\u0303. The larger scale uncertainty could be\n1\n\n\fcompensated by the comparatively larger cross section, but the processes are not purely QCD, so we\ndo not consider them here.\nWe perform leading order, parton level Monte Carlo calculations of the SM tt\u0304bb\u0304 and LESS tt\u0304g\u0303g\u0303\nproduction cross sections, for gluino masses in the range mg\u0303 = 12 \u2212 16 GeV.\n\u221a Cross sections are\ncalculated for both pp\u0304 collisions relevant to Run II of the Fermilab\nTevatron,\ns = 2.0 TeV, and for\n\u221a\npp collisions at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), s = 14.0 TeV. Decay of the top quarks\nis included at the matrix element level, to determine the efficiency of realistic kinematic cuts that\nwould be imposed in such a search. We apply those efficiencies to the inclusive tt\u0304g\u0303g\u0303 rate, but we treat\nthe gluinos as final state particles, impose a minimum transverse momentum cut on the gluinos, and\nassume that their decay leads to an observable hadronic jet with vertex tag from the daughter bottom\nquark. Kinematic cuts used at the Tevatron (LHC) are as follows:\npT (j) > 15(20)GeV,\npT (b) > 20(20)GeV,\npT (l) > 15(15)GeV,\np/T > 30(30)GeV,\n\n|\u03b7(j)| < 3.0(4.0) ,\n|\u03b7(b)| < 2.0(2.5) ,\n|\u03b7(l)| < 2.0(2.5) ,\n\u25b3Rmn > 0.4(0.4) .\n\n(1)\n\nwhere m, n are leptons, bottom quarks, gluinos or light jets.\nMatrix elements were constructed with a LESS-modified version of madgraph [9]. We used\nCTEQ5L parton distribution functions [10] with factorization scale \u03bcf = mt + mjj /2, where mjj is\nthe invariant mass of the extra bottom quark or gluino pair. The renormalization scale was taken to\nbe the same, \u03bcr = \u03bcf . We do not consider any additional contribution from tt\u0304b\u03031 b\u0303 \u03041 production, as first\nthe rate is much lower than for gluinos, and second as this introduces additional model dependence:\nwhether the bottom squarks are long-lived or not; and if not, whether they have sufficient mass to\ndecay into bottom quarks.\nIn the LESS scenario, we take into account the altered running of the QCD coupling, \u03b1s , which\noccurs due to the presence of the light gluino and bottom squark contributions to the beta function.\nThis causes \u03b1s to be considerably larger at the top quark mass scale. Since the cross sections are\nproportional to \u03b1s4 , this effect increases the signal considerably. In calculating the signal cross section,\nwe must also consider the effect of enhanced \u03b1s on the SM tt\u0304bb\u0304 rate \u2013 an increase of 30%. We fix\nthe value of the coupling to be \u03b1s (mb ) = 0.205, and use two-loop running with the bottom squark\nmass set to the bottom quark mass, mb\u03031 = mb [8]. We run the coupling from low-energy data,\nbecause if light gluinos and squarks exist, then the extraction of \u03b1s from low energy data would be\nunaffected by the LESS particle content. The value of \u03b1s obtained at the Z mass scale is 0.127\u20130.128\nfor mg\u0303 = 15 \u2212 12 GeV. Given the uncertainty on \u03b1s (mb ), this result is within experimental errors, as\ndiscussed in Ref. [8].\nWe calculate the tt\u0304bb\u0304 cross section at the Tevatron to be 4.0 fb for pT (b) > 20 GeV (applied to\nthe additional bottom quarks only; no top decays) 1 . We find a 25% efficiency for the kinematic cuts\nfor both the semileptonic (brancyhing ratio (BR) = 29%) and all-hadronic (BR = 46%) decay modes\nof the top quarks. We do not consider the all-leptonic channel (BR = 4.7%) as the rate is much less\nthan one expected event for reasonable Run II luminosity. The LESS cross section for tt\u0304g\u0303g\u0303 production\n\n1 Ref\n\n[11] imposed the same pT (b) cut but did not impose a cut on the rapidity of the b quarks.\n\n2\n\n\fvaries from 11.2 fb at mg\u0303 = 12 GeV to 8.1 fb at 16 GeV, as shown in Fig. 1. The tt\u0304bb\u0304 rate is 5.8 fb with\nLESS \u03b1s running. Assuming that the all-hadronic mode could be used (we don't assume top quark\nreconstruction is necessary), which is somewhat optimistic, and with a bottom quark vertex tagging\nefficiency of \u01ebb = 50% and demanding that all four bottom quarks are tagged, then with 30 fb\u22121 of\nintegrated luminosity, we estimate between 4.5 and 3.5 signal events on a SM background 2 of 1.4\nevents. Using Poisson statistics, this corresponds to a 2.6 to 2.0 sigma effect. Alternatively, one may\ninterpret this as the Tevatron having some capability to place 95% c.l. limits on this scenario.\nWe note that this analysis is different from the planned search for tt\u0304H, which has the same final\nstate signature, except for lack of a mass peak in the extra bottom quark pair spectrum. The fact that\nthis final state arising from light gluinos produces essentially identical kinematic distributions to the\nSM case makes our proposed channel search more difficult, but is mitigated by the much larger overall\nrate from light gluinos that from a Higgs boson. We speculate that this search could be improved at\nthe Tevatron by requiring only three vertex tags, as in the analysis of Ref. [11]. This would increase\nthe total sample by about a factor of five, but also approximately double the SM background by fake\ntags from tt\u0304gg events. Nevertheless, 22 signal events on a background of about 15 events is an \u2248 4.5\u03c3\neffect. We feel more thorough investigation along these lines is warranted. It may also be useful to\nexamine additional production channels at the Tevatron, such as Z g\u0303g\u0303, which will have larger cross\nsections but other complications in their analysis.\nThe situation is much better at the LHC. We calculate the SM tt\u0304bb\u0304 total cross section (pT (b) >\n20 GeV, no top quark decays) to be 1.9 pb, a rate copious enough to allow one to examine the cleaner\nall-leptonic top quark decay channel as well as the semi-leptonic channel. We find cuts efficiencies of\n30% and 20%, respectively. The tt\u0304g\u0303g\u0303 cross section varies from 9.0 pb for 12 GeV gluinos to 7.2 pb\nfor 16 GeV gluinos, as shown in Fig. 1. The tt\u0304bb\u0304 rate is 2.8 pb with LESS \u03b1s running. Again using\n\u01ebb = 50% and demanding four tags, we estimate that each experiment would observe from 15 to 12\nsignal events in the all-leptonic channel alone, with only 2 fb\u22121 of data. Against the SM background\nof 3.3 events, this would yield a 5\u03c3 effect over the entire gluino mass range considered. In the semileptonic channel for the same amount of data, we estimate 61 to 54 signal events on a background of\n18 events, potentially resulting in better than 12\u03c3 observation.\nOne caveat is that of the long-lived bottom squark scenario: if the daughter bottom quark jets\ncoming from the low-pT portion of the gluino spectrum do not have sufficient energy to be identified\nas jets, this analysis could suffer. To compensate we also investigated the case where all b partons and\ngluinos were instead required to have pT > 50 GeV. The rates fall by somewhat more than 50%, but\nthe all-leptonic decay channel would need only 10 fb\u22121 and the semi-leptonic channel only 3 fb\u22121 each\nto reflect a 5\u03c3 observation of light gluinos. Thus, we feel this this analysis can easily be made model\nindependent at the LHC.\nA final point to consider is the scale uncertainty of the cross sections. We estimate this by first\ncalculating the cross sections for \u03bcf,r = 2\u03bcf,r , \u03bcf,r /2 and find about +75%/ \u2212 45% variation. We also\nfind a 75% enhancement if we use \u03bcf as originally stated, but apply two factors of \u03b1s (\u03bcr = \u03bcf ) and\ntwo factors \u03b1s (mjj ). At LHC energies this results in an increase of about 75% in the rate. Since our\nsignal cross sections are typically a factor four larger than the SM background, we are safe in assuming\nthat theoretical uncertainties on the cross section cannot be a limiting factor in this analysis.\n\n2 Calculated\n\nwith SM running of the coupling.\n\n3\n\n\fFigure 1. tt\u0304g\u0303g\u0303 cross section (solid lines) as a function of the gluino mass, mg\u0303 , at the Fermilab Tevatron\n(left) and CERN LHC (right) for pT (b) > 20 GeV. Also shown are the SM tt\u0304bb\u0304 rates (dashed lines), and tt\u0304bb\u0304\nrate with LESS-enhanced running of \u03b1s (dotted lines).\n\nWe have presented an alternative production channel for light gluinos in a particular LESS model.\nIt has the advantages of extremely distinctive final state signature (four bottom quarks and two W\nbosons), scale uncertainties much smaller than the increase in rate due to non-SM particles, and the\nonly model dependence is the gluino mass. The observable rate at the Tevatron, after kinematical\ncuts and approximate efficiencies, is unfortunately useful only to place probably 95% c.l. limits on the\nLESS scenario, and even then only with large integrated luminosity. However, the LHC can make a\n5\u03c3 observation of light gluinos with only a few months of running at planned luminosity.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe want to thank Alex Kagan for useful discussions.
