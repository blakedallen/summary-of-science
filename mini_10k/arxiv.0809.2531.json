Introduction\nThe understanding of the role played by impurities on the nature of phase transitions\nis of great importance, both from experimental and theoretical perspectives. Firstorder phase transitions are known to be dramatically softened under the presence of\nquenched randomness [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], while continuous transitions may have their\nexponents altered under random fields or random bonds [3, 7, 8]. There are some\nvery useful phenomenological arguments and some, perturbative in nature, theoretical\nresults, pertaining to the occurrence and nature of phase transitions under the presence\nof quenched randomness [3, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. The most celebrated criterion is that\nsuggested by Harris [7]. This criterion relates directly the persistence, under random\nbonds, of the non random behavior to the specific heat exponent \u03b1p of the pure system.\nAccording to this criterion, if ap is positive, then the disorder will be relevant, i.e., under\nthe effect of the disorder, the system will reach a new critical behavior. Otherwise, if ap\nis negative, disorder is irrelevant and the critical behavior will not change. The value\n\u03b1p = 0 is an inconclusive, marginal case. The 2D Ising model falls into this category,\nit is the most studied case, but is still controversial [14]. In general and despite the\nintense efforts of the last years on several different models, our current understanding\nof the quenched randomness effects is rather limited and the situation appears still\nunclear for both cases of first- and second-order phase transitions. The present paper\naims to contribute to our knowledge of the effects of quenched bond disorder on secondorder phase transitions. In this quite active field of research, the resort to large scale\nMonte Carlo simulations is often necessary and useful, and following this recipe, we\napplied some recently developed by our group numerical schemes - see reference [15]\nand references therein - on two types of random bond Ising models.\nIn the first part of the paper we present an extension of our numerical investigation\nof a random bond spin model in 2D with competing interactions, known as the random\nbond square SAF model [16]. Details of the pure and random version of this model with\ncompeting interactions and the motivation of such a study will be given below in the\ncorresponding Section, but can also be found in our recently published Letter [16] and\nin other related papers in the literature [17]. Furthermore, in the second part of our\nwork, by a parallel study - using the same numerical techniques - we attempt to shed\nnew light into the well-known random bond version of the 2D (simple) Ising model.\nOur investigation will be related to the extensive relevant literature concerning this\ncase [18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39,\n40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58]. In particular, our\ndiscussion will focus on the main point of the last two decades, concerning the two wellknown conflicting scenarios, namely the logarithmic corrections [18, 19, 21, 22] versus\nthe weak universality scenario [31, 32, 59, 60].\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: In the next Section we outline an\nextensive entropic sampling program. This program is based on (i) the Wang-Landau\n(WL) method [61], (ii) the dominant energy restriction scheme [62], and (iii) a second\n\n\fQuenched bond randomness in marginal and non-marginal Ising spin models in 2D\n\n3\n\nstage improvement that combines the WL method [61] and some new ideas [15, 16, 63],\nsuitable for the study also of disordered systems. Our FSS analysis of the numerical\ndata and the corresponding discussion of the random bond versions of the square SAF\nmodel and the 2D Ising model are presented in Sections 3 and 4, respectively. Finally,\nour conclusions are summarized in Section 5.\n2. Simulation schemes and numerical details\nImportance sampling methods have been for many years the main tools in condensed\nmatter physics and critical phenomena [64, 65, 66, 67, 68]. However, for complex\nsystems, effective potentials may have a rugged landscape, that becomes more\npronounced with increasing system size. In such cases, these traditional methods\nbecome inefficient, since they cannot overcome such barriers in the state space. A\nlarge number of generalized ensemble methods have been proposed to overcome such\nproblems [61, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82]. One\nimportant class of these methods emphasizes the idea of directly sampling the energy\ndensity of states (DOS) and may be called entropic sampling methods [67]. In entropic\nsampling, instead of sampling microstates with probability proportional to e\u2212\u03b2E , we\nsample microstates with probability proportional to [G(E)]\u22121 , where G(E) is the DOS,\nthus producing a flat energy histogram. The prerequisite for the implementation\nof the method, is the DOS information of the system, a problem that can now be\nhandled in many adequate ways via a number of interesting approaches proposed in\nthe last two decades. The most remarkable examples are the Lee entropic [69, 70], the\nmulticanonical [73, 74], the broad histogram [71], the transition matrix [72], the WL [61],\nand the optimal ensemble methods [82].\nIn particular, the WL algorithm [61] is one of the most refreshing variations of\nthe Monte Carlo simulation methods introduced in the last years. The algorithm has\nalready been successfully used in many problems of statistical physics, biophysics, and\nothers [83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98]. To apply the WL\nalgorithm, an appropriate energy range of interest has to be identified and a WL random\nwalk is performed in this energy subspace. Trials from a spin state with energy Ei to a\nspin state with energy Ef , using local spin flip dynamics, are accepted according to the\ntransition probability\n\"\n\n#\n\nG(Ei )\n,1 .\np(Ei \u2192 Ef ) = min\nG(Ef )\n\n(1)\n\nDuring the WL process the DOS G(E) is modified (G(E) \u2192 f \u2217 G(E)) after each\nspin flip trial by a modification factor f > 1. In the WL process (j = 1, 2, . . . , jf )\nsuccessive refinements of the DOS are achieved by decreasing the modification factor\nfj . Most implementations\nuse an initial modification factor fj=1 = e \u2248 2.71828 . . ., a\nq\nrule fj+1 = fj , and a 5% \u2212 10% flatness criterion (on the energy histogram) in order\nto move to the next refinement level (j \u2192 j + 1) [61]. The process is terminated in a\nsufficiently high-level (f \u2248 1, whereas the detailed balanced condition limit is f \u2192 1).\n\n\fQuenched bond randomness in marginal and non-marginal Ising spin models in 2D\n\n4\n\nIn the last few years, there have been several papers dealing with improvements and\nsophisticated implementations of the WL iterative process [63, 70, 84, 91, 97, 99, 100,\n101]. The present authors have introduced a dominant energy subspace implementation\nof the above entropic methods, called critical minimum energy subspace (CrMES)\nmethod [62]. This is a method of a systematic restriction of the energy space, with\nincreasing lattice size, by which one can determine all finite-size thermal anomalies of the\nsystem from the final accurate DOS, and also other (magnetic) anomalies of the system\nby accumulating appropriate histogram data in the final almost entropic stage of the\nprocess. The (WL) random walk takes place in a restricted energy subspace (E1 , E2 ) and\nthis practice produces an immense speed up, without introducing observable errors. It\nhas been shown that the method can be followed successfully in pure systems undergoing\nsecond- or first-order phase transitions [62, 85] and also in more complex systems with\ncomplicated free energy landscapes, such as the 3D random field Ising model [15].\nFor the simulation of the random bond models considered in this paper, we followed\nthe general framework of the implementation of the above described scheme. In\nparticular, we followed most of the details of the implementation applied recently to\nthe 3D random field Ising model and outlined for the random bond version of the SAF\nmodel in our recently published Letter [16]. In these papers, a two stage strategy has\nbeen followed. In the first stage, a multi-range (multi-R) WL method was applied, where\nthe total energy range was split in many subintervals [61] and the DOS's of these separate\npieces were then joined at the end of the process. The WL refinement levels used in\nthis first multi-R WL stage (j = 1, . . . , ji ), were as follows: ji = 18 for L < 80, ji = 19\nfor 80 \u2264 L < 120, and ji = 20 for L \u2265 120. In the second stage of the simulation\n(WL refinement levels: j = ji \u2212 jf ), a more demanding multi-R - but with larger\nenergy pieces - or an one-range (one-R) approach was carried out. The identification\nof the appropriate energy subspace (E1 , E2 ) for the entropic sampling of each disorder\nrealization was carried out by applying our CrMES restriction [62] and taking the union\nsubspace at both pseudocritical temperatures of the specific heat and susceptibility. This\nunion subspace, extended by 10% from each side, low- and high-energy side, is in most\ncases sufficient for an accurate estimation of all finite-size anomalies. The identification\nof the appropriate energy subspace was carried out in the first multi-R WL stage, using\noriginally a very wide energy subspace. After the first identification, the same first stage\nprocess (j = 1, . . . , ji ) was repeated several times, typically \u223c 4 \u2212 6 times, in the new\nrestricted energy subspace. From our experience, this repeated application of this first\nstage multi-R WL approach greatly improves accuracy, and then the resulting accurate\nDOS is used again for a final and more accurate redefinition of the subspace (E1 , E2 ),\nin which the final entropic scheme (second stage) is applied. Thus, the final entropic\nWL stage (j = ji \u2212 jf ), where jf = ji + 4 in all cases, was carried out in this accurately\ndefined subspace in an one-R or in a multi-R approach. For the present models, it\nwas found that a final multi-R approach with large subranges (see below) is in fact\nsufficiently accurate. Therefore, since the multi-R of the original WL scheme improves\nefficiency, we applied, for most of our simulations, this multi-R WL approach also in\n\n\fQuenched bond randomness in marginal and non-marginal Ising spin models in 2D\n\n5\n\nthe final entropic stage, using three times larger energy subintervals than in the initial\nmulti-R stage. The energy subintervals of the first stage where chosen to correspond to\nrather large subspaces, with their sizes depending on the disorder strength. Taking the\npure system as reference, these energy subintervals could be chosen of the order of 50\nto 100 energy levels, depending on the lattice size. In the disorder case, the subinterval\nsizes are multiplied by the factor induced due to the new multiplicity of energy levels,\ngiving for instance, a factor 4 for the disorder strength r = 3/5 = 0.6, where r is the\nratio of weak over strong bond interactions (see also next Section).\nAs pointed out above, the need of using in the final stage the described multi-R\napproach, instead of an one-R approach, is a consequence of the slow convergence at\nthe high WL levels. It is possible to overcome this slow convergence by using a looser\nflatness criterion or an alternative Lee entropic final stage, as proposed in reference [70]\nand applied by the present authors [15]. However, recently a different alternative has\nbeen proposed by Belardinelli and Pereyra (BP) [63], which is free of the application\nof the energy-histogram flatness criterion. Following their proposal, one is using, in the\nfinal stage, an almost continuously changing modification factor adjusted according to\nthe rule ln f \u223c t\u22121 . Since t is the Monte Carlo time, using a time-step conveniently\ndefined proportional to the size of the energy subinterval, the efficiency of this scheme\nis independent of the size of the subintervals and therefore the method provides the\nsame efficiency in both multi-R and one-R approaches. Furthermore, from the tests\nperformed by these authors, and also from our comparative studies in the 2D pure\nIsing model (unpublished), the error-behavior of this method seems superior to the\noriginal WL process, improving to some extent the saturation-error problem of the\nWL method. Accordingly, we have also applied this alternative route for the final\nstage of our simulations using an one-R approach. In particular, the disorder strength\ncase r = 9/11 = 0.818 of the random bond square SAF model, and all simulations\ncorresponding to the larger sizes L = 160 and L = 200 of the random bond Ising model\nwere carried out using this alternative. From our comparative tests, we found that both\napproaches (the BP and the multi-R WL approach) produced very accurate results,\nwith the BP approach giving superior estimates for the pseudocritical temperatures of\nthe models.\nBoth disordered models were simulated for two values of the disorder strength r.\nFor the random bond square SAF model we chose the values r = 9/11 = 0.818 and\nr = 3/5 = 0.6, whereas for the random bond Ising model the values r = 3/5 = 0.6\nand r = 1/7 = 0.142 have been considered. Square lattices, using periodic boundary\nconditions, with linear sizes L in the range L = 20 \u2212 120 or L = 20 \u2212 200 (disorder\nstrength case r = 1/7 = 0.142) were used. A number of 200, disorder realizations\nwas generated and simulated for each disorder case and lattice size. Even for the larger\nlattice sizes the statistical errors of the WL method (WL-errors), used for the estimation\nof thermal and magnetic properties of a particular realization, were found to be much\nsmaller than the statistical errors of the disorder averaging, coming from the fact that we\nhave used a finite number of 200 disorder realizations. Therefore, the WL-errors are not\n\n\fQuenched bond randomness in marginal and non-marginal Ising spin models in 2D\n\n6\n\nshown in our graphs, whereas the latter errors of finite disorder sampling are presented\nin our figures as error bars. The mean values over disorder will be denoted as [. . .]av , the\ncorresponding maxima as [. . .]\u2217av , and finally the individual maxima as [. . .\u2217 ]av . Since\nin the fitting attempts of the following Sections, we have used mainly data from the\npeaks of the disorder averaged curves (i.e. [C]\u2217av ), their finite disorder sampling errors\nare the relevant statistical errors to be used in the fitting attempts. These errors have\nbeen estimated by two similar methods, using groups of 25 to 50 realizations for each\nlattice size and the jackknife method or a straightforward variance calculation (blocking\nmethod) [67]. The jackknife method yielded some reasonably conservative errors, about\n10 \u2212 20% larger than the corresponding calculated standard deviations, and are shown\nas error bars in our figures. Finally, let us point out that in all cases studied, the sampleto-sample fluctuations for the individual maxima are much large than the corresponding\nfinite disorder sampling errors.\n3. The random bond square SAF model: Competing interactions\nIn this Section we extend our investigation on the effects of quenched bond randomness\non the square Ising model with nearest- (Jnn ) and next-nearest-neighbor (Jnnn )\nantiferromagnetic interactions. In zero field, the pure square SAF model, is governed\nby the Hamiltonian:\nHp = Jnn\n\nX\n\n<i,j>\n\nSi Sj + Jnnn\n\nX\n\nSi Sj ,\n\n(2)\n\n(i,j)\n\nwhere here both nearest- (Jnn ) and next-nearest-neighbor (Jnnn ) interactions are\nassumed to be positive. It is well-known that the model develops at low temperatures\nSAF order for R = Jnn /Jnnn > 0.5 [102, 103, 104] and by symmetry the critical\nbehavior associated with the SAF ordering is the same under Jnn \u2192 \u2212Jnn . For\nthe case R = 1, that we deal with, the pure system undergoes a second-order\nphase transition, in accordance with the commonly accepted scenario for many years\nof a non-universal critical behavior with exponents depending on the coupling ratio\nR [102, 103, 105, 106, 107]. The recent numerical study of Malakis et al [108] has\nrefined earlier estimates [103, 106] for the correlation length exponent \u03bd and values\nvery close to those of the 2D three-state Potts model \u03bdp (Potts)= 5/6 [109] were\nobtained. From the FSS of the pseudocritical temperatures [108] it was found that\n\u03bdp (SAF;R = 1)= 0.8330(30) and the subsequent study of Monroe and Kim [110],\nusing the Fisher zeroes of the partition function, yielded a quite matching estimate:\n\u03bdp (SAF;R = 1)= 0.848(1). Furthermore, from the FSS of the specific heat data an\nestimate for the ratio \u03b1p /\u03bdp = 0.412(5) was also found [108]. Finally, from the magnetic\ndata and in accordance with an earlier conjecture of Binder and Landau [103], Malakis\net al [108] found additional evidence of the weak universality scenario [59, 60] and\nobtained the values \u03b2p /\u03bdp = 0.125 and \u03b3p /\u03bdp = 1.75. The values of the above three\nratios of exponents satisfy the Rushbrook relation, assuming that \u03bdp = 0.8292, which is\nvery close to the estimate obtained from the shift behavior of the SAF R = 1 model, thus\n\n\fQuenched bond randomness in marginal and non-marginal Ising spin models in 2D\n\n7\n\n6\n3.05\n\nPure Model\n\nr=0.818\n[C]\n\n3.00\n\n*\nav\n\n=a+bL\n\n*\n\n/\n\nr=0.818: [C ]\n\nav\n\n/ =-0.12(6)\nav\n\n*\n\nr=0.818: [C]\n\n*\n\n[C]\n\n5\n\n2.95\n\n*\n\nr=0.6: [C]\n\nSpecific Heat\n\n2.90\n\n4\n\nav\n\nav\n\n2.85\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n110\n\n120\n\n130\n\nL\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\nL\n\nFigure 1.

From these results, it is tempting\nto conjecture, as was pointed out in reference [16], that the SAF model with R = 1 obeys\nthe same thermal exponents with the 2D three-state Potts model (\u03bdp = 5/6 = 0.833 . . .\nand \u03b1p = 1/3 = 0.333 . . . [109]), but the respective values of the magnetic critical\nexponents are different (\u03b2p /\u03bdp = 2/15 = 0.133 . . . and \u03b3p /\u03bdp = 26/15 = 1.733 . . . for the\n2D three-state Potts model [109]).\nConsidering now the random bond distribution [16]\nJ1 + J2\nJ2\n1\n(3)\n= 1; r = ,\nP (Jij ) = [\u03b4(Jij \u2212 J1 ) + \u03b4(Jij \u2212 J2 )];\n2\n2\nJ1\nwhere the ratio r stands for the disorder strength, the Hamiltonian of equation (1) is\ntransformed into the following disordered one\nH=\n\nX\n\n<i,j>\n\nJij Si Sj +\n\nX\n\nJij Si Sj .\n\n(4)\n\n(i,j)\n\nThe critical behavior of the above defined random model for the case r = 3/5 = 0.6 has\nbeen outlined in reference [16], where apart from the verification of the weak universality\nscenario, a strong saturating behavior of the specific heat has been witnessed. Here, we\nextend our study to a weaker disorder strength, namely the case r = 9/11 = 0.818.\nLet us start the presentation of our results with the most striking effect of the\nbond randomness on the specific heat of the square SAF model.

The inset shows a log-log plot of the maxima of the average\nlogarithmic derivatives of the order-parameter of first-, second-, and fourth-order, for\nthe case r = 0.818. Linear fits are applied for L \u2265 30.\n\nrandom bond model (filled and open circles for r = 0.818 and open triangles for the\ncase r = 0.6). For the case r = 0.818 we show two data set points for the specific\nheat, corresponding to the two averaging processes discussed previously in Section 2.\nNote that the error bars for the quantity [C \u2217 ]av shown reflect the sample-to-sample\nfluctuations, whereas all other error bars are statistical errors due to the finite number\nof disorder realizations (jackknife errors discussed in Section 2). The suppression of the\nspecific heat maxima is clear for both disorder strength values and of course it is much\nstronger for the case r = 0.6, for which a clear saturation is observed even for the smaller\nsizes shown (L = 40). For the present value r = 0.818 we show in the inset of figure 1 a\npower law fitting attempt of the form [C]\u2217av \u223c C\u221e + bL\u03b1/\u03bd for sizes L \u2265 80 which gives\na negative value for the exponent \u03b1/\u03bd of the order of \u22120.12(6). Notably, this value of\n\u03b1/\u03bd will be shown to be compatible with the one obtained by an alternative method via\nthe Rushbrook relation.\nIn figure 2(a) we present the FSS behavior of several pseudocritical temperatures of\nthe model T[Z]\u2217av , i.e. the temperatures corresponding to the maxima of several average\ncurves, such as the specific heat (Z = C), the magnetic susceptibility (Z = \u03c7), the\n|>\n), and\nabsolute order-parameter derivative with respect to the temperature (Z = \u2202<|M\n\u2202T\nthe logarithmic derivatives of several powers of the order-parameter with respect to the\n\n\fQuenched bond randomness in marginal and non-marginal Ising spin models in 2D\n\n9\n\n1.2\n(b)\n\n(a)\n\nr=0.818:\n\n1.1\n\nr=0.6:\n\nr=0.818:\n\n/ =0.124(6)\n\nr=0.6:\n\n/ =0.126(5)\n\n/ =1.749(9)\n\n/ =1.751(10)\n\n1\n\nMagnetic Susceptibility\n\n100\n\n0.8\n\n0.7\n\n[M]\n\nav\n\nc\n\n(T=T )\n\n0.9\n\n0.6\n\n10\n\n0.5\n1\n\n0.4\n1\n\n10\n\nL\n\n100\n\n1\n\n10\n\nL\n\n100\n\nFigure 3.

In both panels, the solid and dotted lines are corresponding linear fits for\nL \u2265 30.\n>\n, n = 1, 2 and 4). For the case r = 0.818 all the above\ntemperature (Z = \u2202 ln<M\n\u2202T\n6 mentioned pseudocritical temperatures are presented and are compared to the case\nr = 0.6 [16]. The lines show two sets of simultaneous fitting attempts, according to the\nshift relation\nn\n\nT[Z]\u2217av = Tc + bL\u22121/\u03bd ,\n\n(5)\n\ngiving Tc = 2.058(8) for r = 0.818 and Tc = 1.980(9) for r = 0.6, respectively, for\nthe critical temperature of the disordered model. Note that the corresponding critical\ntemperature of the pure system is Tc;p = 2.0823(17) [108]. The values for \u03c72 /DoF of\nthe fits shown depend on the method used to evaluate the statistical errors (jackknife\nor simple standard deviation errors) and in all cases studied in this paper vary in the\nrange 0.1 \u2212 0.5. A first estimation of the critical exponent \u03bd of the correlation length\nis obtained from the above shift behavior and is \u03bd = 1.050(13) and \u03bd = 1.080(20) for\nr = 0.818 and r = 0.6 respectively, as illustrated in the graph. An alternative estimation\nof the exponent \u03bd is attempted now from the FSS analysis of the logarithmic derivatives\nof the order-parameter [111] with respect to the temperature [4, 112]\nhM n Ei\n\u2202 lnhM n i\n=\n\u2212 hEi,\n(6)\n\u2202T\nhM n i\nwhich scale as L1/\u03bd with the system size. In figure 2(b) we consider in a log-log scale\nthe size dependence of the maxima of the average second-order logarithmic derivative\n\n\fQuenched bond randomness in marginal and non-marginal Ising spin models in 2D 10\nof the order-parameter for r = 0.818 (open circles) and r = 0.6 (open triangles). The\nsolid and dotted lines are corresponding linear fits whose slopes provides respectively\nestimates for 1/\u03bd and thus for the exponent \u03bd. It is clear for the figure that the slopes of\nthe lines are different and the results we obtain from the linear fits are are \u03bd = 1.047(10)\nand \u03bd = 1.090(12) for r = 0.818 and r = 0.6, respectively. In the corresponding inset of\nfigure 2(b) we present the first- (filled squares), second- (open circles), and fourth-order\n(open triangles) maxima of the average over the ensemble of realizations logarithmic\nderivatives of the order-parameter for the case r = 0.818. The solid, dashed, and dotted\nlines shown are corresponding linear fits whose slopes provide an average estimate for\nthe exponent \u03bd of the order of \u03bd = 1.046(10). These results for the exponent \u03bd for both\nvalues of the disorder strength r compare favorably with the estimation of \u03bd from the\nabove shift behavior shown in panel (a) of figure 2. Thus, in comparison with its value of\nthe pure model, the exponent \u03bd for the disordered model shows an increase of the order\nof 20% for the case r = 0.818 and 30% for the case r = 0.6, reflecting, in both cases, the\nstrong influence of the disorder on the thermal properties of the system. Noteworthy\nthat, our estimates for the exponent \u03bd are in agreement with the inequality \u03bd \u2265 2/D\nderived by Chayes et al [8] for disordered systems.\nTurning now to the magnetic properties of the model we present in figure 3(a) in\na log-log scale the FSS behavior of the average order-parameter for r = 0.818 (open\ncircles) at Tc = 2.058 and r = 0.6 (open triangles) at Tc = 1.98. The straight\nlines show linear fits for L \u2265 30 with a slope of 0.124(6) for r = 0.818 and 0.126(5)\nfor r = 0.6. Thus, these two estimations for the ratio \u03b2/\u03bd indicate that although\nthe exponent \u03b2 increases with disorder, the ratio \u03b2/\u03bd remains unchanged to its pure\nvalue, i.e. \u03b2/\u03bd = \u03b2p /\u03bdp = 0.125 [16, 108]. Correspondingly, we show in panel (b) of\nfigure 3 the behavior of the magnetic susceptibility that provides estimates for the ratio\n\u03b3/\u03bd. The open circles refer to the case r = 0.818 and the open triangles to the case\nr = 0.6. The solid and dotted lines are linear fits giving the values \u03b3/\u03bd = 1.749(9)\nand \u03b3/\u03bd = 1.751(10), respectively. Thus, the ratio \u03b3/\u03bd maintains the value of the\npure model for both disorder strength values considered. The ratios \u03b2/\u03bd and \u03b3/\u03bd for\nthe disordered square SAF model appear to be the same with the corresponding ratios\nof the pure square SAF model but different from those of the 2D three-state Potts\nmodel. Therefore, our results reinforce both the weak universality scenario for the pure\nSAF model, as first predicted by Binder and Landau [103], as well as the generalized\nstatement of weak universality in the presence of bond randomness, given by Kim [113]\nand concerning also the 2D random bond three-state Potts ferromagnet.\nFinally, having estimated the ratios \u03b2/\u03bd, \u03b3/\u03bd, and the exponent \u03bd, we attempt to\nestimate the specific heat exponent \u03b1 using either the Rushbrook (\u03b1 + 2\u03b2 + \u03b3 = 2)\nor equivalently, since 2\u03b2/\u03bd + \u03b3/\u03bd = 2, the hyperscaling (2 \u2212 \u03b1 = D\u03bd) relation. For\nthe case r = 0.818 we find a value \u03b1/\u03bd = \u22120.09(4) which is in agreement with\nthe value \u03b1/\u03bd = \u22120.12(6) estimated from the fitting of the larger specific heat data\nshown in the inset of figure 1. In the case of a non-divergent specific heat it is quite\ninteresting to consider also, rather than the specific heat, the internal energy scaling at\n\n\fQuenched bond randomness in marginal and non-marginal Ising spin models in 2D 11\nthe estimated critical temperature. This provides an estimate for the exponent ratio\n(\u03b1 \u2212 1)/\u03bd, which may be more precise [114]. We finally carried out such a fitting using\nthe larger sizes (L \u2265 80) on the values of the critical energy (at Tc = 2.058) and we found\n(\u03b1 \u22121)/\u03bd = \u22121.04(4). This result, when combined with the estimate for \u03bd from the shift\nbehavior (\u03bd = 1.050(13)) gives a value \u03b1/\u03bd = \u22120.09(3), an intriguing coincidence, in\nfull agreement with the above value obtained for this ratio, via the Rushbrook relation.\nFor the case r = 0.6 [16], the saturation effect is much more stronger and an even more\nnegative value for the specific heat exponent \u03b1 is obtained \u03b1 = \u22120.17(4). From the above\nand in agreement with our preliminary observation in reference [16], it turns out that this\nstrong saturating behavior of the specific heat is completely different from the behavior\nof the 2D random bond three-state Potts ferromagnet [113, 115]. There, a specific heat\ndiverging behavior is obtained for disorder strengths r = 0.9, 0.5, and 0.25 [113] and\nan increasing but progressively saturating behavior is obtained only for the very strong\ndisorder r = 0.1[115]. This behavior of the specific heat of the random bond square\nSAF model may presumably be attributed to the competitive nature of interactions,\nresponsible for the observed sensitivity of the SAF model to bond randomness.\n4. The marginal case of the 2D random bond Ising model\nThe Hamiltonian of the random bond version of the 2D Ising model system is given by\nH=\u2212\n\nX\n\nJij Si Sj ,\n\n(7)\n\n<i,j>\n\nwhere again the implementation of the bond disorder follows the binary distribution (3)\nof ferromagnetic interaction strengths. With this distribution the random Ising system\nexhibits a unique advantage that its critical temperature Tc is exactly known [116, 117]\nas a function of the disorder strength r through\nsinh (2J1 /Tc ) sinh (2rJ1 /Tc ) = 1,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere r = J2 /J1 and kB = 1. This gives the opportunity of carrying out the FSS\nanalysis at the exact Tc (r), a practice that highly reduces statistical errors. Furthermore,\none may check for accuracy his numerical scheme by comparing the estimated critical\ntemperature (via the shift behavior) with the exact result, as we have also done here.\nAt this is point, it is useful to briefly discuss the two main and mutually excluded\nscenarios [14] mentioned in the introduction. The logarithmic corrections scenario is\nbased on the quantum field theory results of Dotsenko and Dotsenko [18], and of\nShalaev [19], Shankar [21], and Ludwig [22]. According to this scenario - supported\ntheoretically for the case of weak disorder - the presence of quenched disorder changes\nthe critical properties of the system only through a set of logarithmic corrections to\nthe pure system behavior. The specific heat C is expected to diverge on approach\nto the critical temperature Tc in a double logarithmic form: C \u221d ln(ln t), where\nt = |T \u2212 Tc |/Tc is the reduced critical temperature. On the other hand, according\nto the weak universality scenario [31, 32, 59, 60], critical quantities, such as the zero\n\n\fQuenched bond randomness in marginal and non-marginal Ising spin models in 2D 12\n\n2.34\n\n2.4\n(b)\n\n(a)\nT =2.2245(7) ; T\n\n2.32\n\nc\n\n=2.22419...\n\nc; exact\n\n2.2\n\nc\n\n2.0\n\n2.3\n\n1.8\n\n2.2\n\n2.1\n\n[C]\n\n2.26\n\nc\n\n[C]\n\nav\n\nL\n\n(T=T )\n\n[Z]\n\n*\n\nav\n\nZ=\n\nav\n\nZ=C\n\n2.28\n\nT\n\n(T=T )\n\n1/ =1.01(1)\n\n2.30\n\n1.6\n\n60\n\n2.0\n\n2.24\n4\n\n1.4\n\n4.2\n\n4.4\n\n4.6\n\n4.8\n\n5\n\nlog (log L)\n\n2.22\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\nL\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\nL\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n0.72\n(c)\n\nc\n\n(T=T )\n\n100\n\nc\n\n(T=T )\n\n0.68\n\nav\n\n0.64\n\n[ ]\n\nav\n\n[M]\n\n(d)\n\n/ =1.754(6)\n\n/ =0.125(3)\n\n0.6\n\n10\n\n0.56\n\n10\n\nL\n\n100\n\n10\n\nL\n\n100\n\nFigure 4.

Note that all fitting attempts shown have been performed for\nL \u2265 20.\n\nfield susceptibility, magnetization, and correlation length display power law singularities,\nwith the corresponding exponents \u03b3, \u03b2, and \u03bd changing continuously with the disorder\nstrength; however this variation is such that the ratios \u03b3/\u03bd and \u03b2/\u03bd remain constant\nat the pure system's value. The specific heat of the disordered system is, in this case,\nexpected to saturate [31].\nTwo significantly different values of the disorder strength, namely the cases r =\n3/5 = 0.6 and r = 1/7 = 0.142 have been investigated by our numerical scheme\nand our data will be presented and analyzed below. Due to marginality, the case\nr = 0.6, that produced in the SAF model a 5% temperature decline, gives here,\nthrough equation (8) a critical temperature Tc (r = 0.6) = 2.22419 . . ., very close\n(2%) to the corresponding critical temperature of the pure system (Tc;p = 2.26918 . . .).\nThus, we may call the first case (r = 3/5 = 0.6) a weak disorder and the second case\n(r = 1/7 = 0.142) a strong disorder case, actually producing a significant temperature\n\n\fQuenched bond randomness in marginal and non-marginal Ising spin models in 2D 13\ndecline Tc (r = 0.142) = 1.77910 . . .. Our simulations are extended to lattice sizes in\nthe range L = 20 \u2212 120 for the weak disorder and in the range L = 20 \u2212 200 for the\nstrong disorder, in the hope that we will observe the true asymptotic behavior of the\nmodel. For the calculation of the statistical errors due to the finite number of simulated\nrealizations, we have followed again the practice outlined in Section 2. The values of\n\u03c72 /DoF of all the fits shown below are again in the range 0.1 \u2212 0.5.\nWe start the presentation of our results with the case r = 3/5 = 0.6 and our\nfitting attempts are summarized in figure 4. Figure 4(a) shows a simultaneous fitting including all data points - using the shift behavior (5) for the estimation of the critical\ntemperature and the correlation length exponent. Now, we have used the pseudocritical\ntemperatures T[Z]\u2217av of the specific heat (Z = C) and magnetic susceptibility (Z = \u03c7).\nAs shown in the panel, the estimated value for the critical temperature is Tc = 2.2245(7)\nin excellent agreement with the exact value. Respectively, the estimation of the inverse\nof the correlation length exponent is 1/\u03bd = 1.01(1), which provides a value for \u03bd of the\norder \u03bd = 0.99(1), very close to the value \u03bd = 1 of the pure model.\nIn panel (b) of figure 4 we illustrate the data of the averaged specific heat at the\nexact critical temperature. The solid and dotted lines are corresponding fits of the form\n[C]av (T = Tc ) \u223c C1 + C2 ln (ln L)\n\n(9)\n\nand\n[C]av (T = Tc ) \u223c C\u221e + bL\u03b1/\u03bd .\n\n(10)\n\nAs it clear from this graph, one may not easily discern between the two lines, although\na more careful analysis indicates that the double logarithmic function is more stable.\nWe have performed both kinds of fits for three sets of data points Lmin \u2212 Lmax . We\nfixed Lmax = 120 and varied Lmin as follows: Lmin = 20, Lmin = 50, and Lmin = 80.\nWe have observed that although the values of \u03c72 /DoF are comparable between the\ntwo functions (9) and (10), the coefficient C2 of equation (9) seems to be stable\n(C2 \u2243 1.67(3)), whereas the exponent \u03b1/\u03bd of equation (10) fluctuates, with increasing\nLmin , in the range \u22120.3 to \u22120.2: \u03b1\u03bd (Lmin = 20) = \u22120.24(2), \u03b1\u03bd (Lmin = 50) = \u22120.21(4),\nand \u03b1\u03bd (Lmin = 80) = \u22120.30(3). Although for this case we can not conclusively\ndiscriminate between the two alternatives, the inset in panel (b) shows that the specific\nheat data fits well to the double logarithm for lattice sizes L \u2265 60. Finally, in panels\n(c) and (d) we plot the average magnetization and the average magnetic susceptibility\nat the critical temperature respectively, as a function of the lattice size L in a log-log\nscale. In both cases a linear fit is applied for L \u2265 20 giving the values \u03b2/\u03bd = 0.125(3)\nand \u03b3/\u03bd = 1.754(6), i.e. the ratios of the magnetic exponents \u03b2/\u03bd and \u03b3/\u03bd maintain\nthe values \u03b2p /\u03bdp = 0.125 and \u03b3p /\u03bdp = 1.75 of the pure model.\nWe proceed to present our results for the strong disorder strength r = 1/7 = 0.142.\nAs was already stated above, for this value of r we have extended our simulations up\nto sizes L = 200. Figure 5 summarizes now the critical behavior for the case r = 0.142\nand, in particular, in figure 5(a) we estimate by a simultaneous fitting attempt for the\nlarger lattices (L \u2265 60) the critical temperature and the correlation length exponent.\n\n\fQuenched bond randomness in marginal and non-marginal Ising spin models in 2D 14\n\n1.96\n\n1.00\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n=1.77910...\n\nc; exact\n\n0.95\n\n0.90\n\n[C]\n\n0.80\n\n0.75\n\n1.80\n\n0.92\n\n0.88\n\nL\n\n60\n\nc\n\n[Z]\n\nT\n\n1.84\n\n(T=T )\n\n0.96\n\n0.85\n\nav\n\n*\n\nav\n\nZ=\n\nc\n\nZ=C\n\n1.88\n\n(T=T )\n\n1/ =0.98(3)\n\n1.92\n\nav\n\nc\n\n[C]\n\nT =1.7816(30) ; T\n\n0.84\n\n1.76\n\n1.98\n\n0.70\n\n2.2\n\nlog (log L)\n\n1.76\n0\n\n40\n\n80\n\nL\n\n120\n\n160\n\n200\n\n0\n\n40\n\n80\n\n120\n\n160\n\n200\n\nL\n\n0.7\n\n1000\n\n(c)\n/ =0.125(6)\n\n(d)\n/ =1.752(9)\n\n(T=T )\n\nc\n\nc\n\n(T=T )\n\n0.65\n100\n\n[ ]\n\n[M]\n\nav\n\nav\n\n0.6\n\n10\n\n0.55\n\n0.5\n1\n10\n\nL\n\n100\n\n10\n\nL\n\n100\n\nFigure 5. The same with figure 4 for r = 1/7 = 0.142. Now data for lattice sizes up\nto L = 200 are presented. All fitting attempts shown are performed for L \u2265 60.\n\nThe estimated value for the critical temperature is Tc = 1.7816(30) in good agreement\nwith the exact value. The production of the above accurate estimates for the critical\ntemperatures, even in this strong disorder case, constitutes a concrete reliability test,\nin favor of the accuracy of our numerical scheme. The estimation of the inverse of\nthe correlation length exponent is 1/\u03bd = 0.98(3), providing a value for \u03bd of the order\n\u03bd = 1.02(3), which within error bars agrees with the pure model's correlation length\nexponent value. In panel (b) of figure 5 we plot the data of the averaged specific heat at\nthe exact critical temperature. Again, the solid and dotted lines are corresponding fits\nof the forms (9) and (10) for the larger sizes (L \u2265 60). Our analysis for the quality of the\nfits for the three sets of data points Lmin \u2212 Lmax , with Lmax = 200 and Lmin = 20, 50,\nand 80 indicated a good trend for the values of \u03c72 /DoF for the double logarithmic fits (9)\nin the range: 0.1\u22120.3. Further reliability in favor of the logarithmic corrections scenario\nis provided by the stability of the coefficient C2 : C2 (Lmin = 20) = 0.412(4), C2 (Lmin =\n50) = 0.410(6), C2 (Lmin = 80) = 0.418(7), whereas the value of the exponent \u03b1/\u03bd of\nthe power law (10) approaches zero with increasing Lmin : \u03b1\u03bd (Lmin = 20) = \u22120.27(4),\n\u03b1\n(Lmin = 50) = \u22120.20(6), and \u03b1\u03bd (Lmin = 80) = \u22120.02(3). From the above, we may\n\u03bd\nconclude that our numerical data are more properly described, at least for the larger\nlattice sizes studied, by the double logarithmic form (9). The inset in panel (b) of\nfigure 5 shows again the specific heat data as a function of the double logarithm of\nthe lattice size for L \u2265 60. The solid line shown is an excellent linear fit. It should\n\n\fQuenched bond randomness in marginal and non-marginal Ising spin models in 2D 15\nbe noted that, the above power law behavior (\u03b1/\u03bd \u2192 0\u2212 ) is in full agreement with\nthe earlier observation of Wang et al [25] in the strong disorder regime (r = 1/4 and\nr = 1/10) [25]). Note also that, analogous results have been presented in figure 2 of\nreference [39] for the site diluted Ising model, where sizes up to L = 256 have been\nconsidered. Finally, in panels (c) and (d) we plot the average magnetization and the\naverage magnetic susceptibility at the critical temperature respectively, as a function of\nthe lattice size L in a log-log scale. In both cases, the solid lines shown are linear fits\nfor L \u2265 60 giving again within error bars the values of the pure model, \u03b2/\u03bd = 0.125(6)\nand \u03b3/\u03bd = 1.752(9), respectively.\nSummarizing, we may point out that the difficulties observed in the case of weak\ndisorder in discriminating between the two scenarios have been surpassed by considering\nthe strong disorder case and larger lattice sizes. In particular, we take as evidence in\nfavor of the picture emerged from the theoretical work of Dotsenko and Dotsenko [18]\nand the improved versions of Shalaev [19], Shankar [21], and Ludwig [22], the stability of\nour fitting attempts using the double logarithmic law. Similar conclusions have also been\nreported by the extensive Monte Carlo studies of Wang et al [25] for the random bond\nmodel and also of Selke et al [43], Ballesteros et al [39], and Tomita and Okabe [48] for\nthe site diluted model, by the transfer matrix approach of Ar\u00e3o Reis et al [36, 40] for the\nrandom bond case, and very recently by Kenna and Ruiz-Lorenzo [58] via an alternative\napproach that involves the density of Lee-Yang zeros of the site diluted model.\n5. Conclusions\nThe effects induced by the presence of quenched bond randomness on the critical\nbehavior of two Ising spin models in 2D have been investigated by a sophisticated\nentropic scheme based on the Wang-Landau algorithm. For the random bond square\nSAF model we have extracted accurate estimates for all critical exponents and two\nvalues of the disorder strength. These values verify hyperscaling, satisfy the Chayes\net al inequality [8], and obey very well the weak universality scenario for disordered\nsystems [113]. Furthermore, the strong saturating behavior of the specific heat clearly\ndistinguishes this case of competing interactions from other 2D random bond systems\nstudied previously. For the marginal case of the random bond Ising model, our findings\nfavor the well-known double logarithmic scaling scenario and suggest that the pure\nsystem behavior, \u03bd = 1, is recovered in the asymptotic limit. Here, the estimated\ncritical temperatures, in both cases of disorder, are in excellent agreement with the\nexact values obtained by duality reflecting the accuracy of the implemented entropic\nscheme. Encouraged by this latter observation, we are currently carrying out a similar\nstudy of bond disorder effects in 2D systems undergoing first-order phase transitions.\n\n\fQuenched bond randomness in marginal and non-marginal Ising spin models in 2D 16\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank V Mart\u0131\u0301n-Mayor and W Selke for useful e-mail correspondence.
