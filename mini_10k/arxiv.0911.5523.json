This wavelength is favorable within the radio\u2013mm range for measuring the intrinsic linearly\npolarized emission from AGN, since in general it is only marginally affected by Faraday rotation of the electric\nvector position angle, and depolarization. The I, Q, U, and V Stokes parameter observations were performed with\nthe XPOL polarimeter at the IRAM 30 m Telescope on different observing epochs from July 2005 (when most\nof the measurements were made) to October 2009. Our sample consists of 145 flat-radio-spectrum AGN with\n> 1 Jy at \u223c 86 GHz, as measured at the IRAM 30 m Telescope\ndeclination > \u221230\u25e6 (J2000.0) and flux density \u223c\nfrom 1978 to 1994. This constraint on the radio spectrum causes our sample to be dominated by blazars, which\nallows us to conduct new statistical studies on this class of high-luminosity, relativistically-beamed emitters. We\ndetect linear and circular polarization (above minimum 3\u03c3 levels of \u223c1.5 %, and \u223c0.3 %) for 76 %, and 6 % of the\nsample, respectively. We find a clear excess in degree of linear polarization detected at 86 GHz with regard to that\nat 15 GHz by a factor of \u223c 2. Over our entire source sample, the luminosity of the jets is anti\u2013correlated with the\ndegree of linear polarization. Consistent with previous findings claiming larger Doppler factors for brighter \u03b3-ray\nblazars, quasars listed in our sample, and in the Fermi Large Area Telescope Bright Source Catalog (LBAS), show\nlarger luminosities than non\u2013LBAS ones, but our data do not allow us to confirm the same for BL Lac objects.\nWe do not find a clear relation between the linear polarization angle and the jet structural position angle for any\nsource class in our sample. We interpret this as the consequence of a markedly non-axisymmetric character of\nthe 3 mm emitting region in the jets. We find that intrinsic circular polarization is the most likely mechanism for\ngeneration of the circular polarization detected in our observations.

INTRODUCTION\n\nRadio loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) are known to produce powerful pairs of highly collimated relativistic jets of\nmagnetized plasma, which are able to extend far beyond\nthe boundaries of the host galaxy. Their relativistic nature,\ntheir magnetic fields, and their non-isotropic geometry determine their most relevant observational properties: superluminal motions (e.g., G\u00f3mez et al. 2001; Jorstad et al. 2005),\nDoppler boosted (decreased) emission of the jet pointing at a\nsmall (large) angle to the observer (e.g., Kadler et al. 2004),\nrapid intrinsic emission variability (e.g., Agudo et al. 2006b;\nFuhrmann et al. 2008; Marscher et al. 2008) and changes of the\njet structure (e.g., Jorstad et al. 2007; Agudo et al. 2007), and\nintense polarized synchrotron and inverse-Compton emission\nalong all the electromagnetic spectrum (e.g., Ostorero et al.\n2006; Abdo et al. 2010; Marscher et al. 2010).\nPolarimetric very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) ob1\n2\n\nInstituto de Astrof\u00edsica de Andaluc\u00eda (CSIC), Apartado 3004, E-18080 Granada, Spain\nInstitute for Astrophysical Research, Boston University, 725 Commonwealth Avenue, Boston, MA 02215;\niagudo@bu.edu\n\n3\n\nInstitut de Radio Astronomie Millim\u00e9trique, 300 Rue de la Piscine, 38406 St. Martin d'H\u00e8res, France;\nthum@iram.fr\n\n4\n\nInstituto de Radio Astronom\u00eda Milim\u00e9trica, Avenida Divina Pastora, 7, Local 20, E-18012 Granada, Spain;\nwiesemey@iram.es\n\n5\n\nMax-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Radioastronomie, Auf dem H\u00fcgel, 69, D-53121 Bonn, Germany;\ntkrichbaum@mpifr-bonn.mpg.de\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nAgudo et al.\n\n< 5 %), but with signifa jet) to be weakly linearly polarized ( \u223c\nicantly larger fractional polarization for the jet regions downstream. Indeed, Lister & Homan (2005) reported a general increase of linear polarization degree with increasing distance\noutward from the core in quasars and BL Lacertae (BL Lac) objets, but with BL Lac jets more polarized in general. They also\nfound the cores and jets of radio galaxies to be much weaker or\nnot linearly polarized compared to those in quasars and BL Lac\nobjects. Homan & Lister (2006) found \"strong\" circular polarization (\u22650.3%, as defined by them), usually in the cores of the\nsources (but not always), within \u223c15% of their sample. They\ndid not find significant correlations between the degree of circular polarization in the core and other relevant source properties.\nNo polarization survey of a large number of AGN has been\nperformed at mm wavelengths thus far. It is known that AGN\njets and their cores are affected by non-negligible Faraday rotation measures (RM) typically ranging from \u223c 102 rad m\u22122\n(e.g., Zavala & Taylor 2003, 2004; Gabuzda et al. 2001, 2004;\nAsada et al. 2008) to \u223c 104 rad m\u22122 (e.g., Zavala & Taylor\n2002; Attridge et al. 2005; G\u00f3mez et al. 2008). These large RM\nvalues \u223c 104 rad m\u22122 have only been found for a few sources,\ntypically in the jets of radio galaxies (Zavala & Taylor 2004).\nSince the observed electric vector linear polarization angle of\na source \u03c7obs = \u03c7int + RM \u03bb2 (where RM \u03bb2 is the amount of\nFaraday rotation and \u03c7int is the intrinsic polarization angle), a\n\u03bb =3.5 mm (86 GHz) survey would be much less affected by\nFaraday rotation than are cm wavelength observations. At this\nwavelength, |RM| \u2248 7000 rad m\u22122 would be required to produce\nFaraday rotation by \u2248 5 \u25e6 , the median linear polarization angle\nuncertainty in the measurements presented in this paper. In contrast, such a value of |RM| translates into rotations of \u2248 160\u25e6\nand \u2248 1400\u25e6 at 2 cm (15 GHz) and 6 cm (5 GHz), respectively.\nIf AGN jet RM in the radio and mm emitting regions are similar\nin general \u2013 which is still to be confirmed observationally\u2013 the\nreduced effect of Faraday rotation in mm wavelength observations also makes them much less sensitive to Faraday depolarization, hence reflecting the intrinsic linear polarization properties of the sources with better fidelity than radio observations.\nThe mm wavelength emission of radio loud AGN is typically dominated by compact regions in their jets; either in their\ninnermost cores of emission, or in their pc scale superluminal knots (e.g., Jorstad et al. 2007; Marscher et al. 2008). Indeed, the results from the 86 GHz VLBI survey of Lee et al.\n(2008) have shown that, in general, \u223c 50 % of the total flux\ndensity of their imaged sources is concentrated in regions not\nfurther than \u223c 1.5 milli-arcseconds from the mm core. In contrast, because of the longer lifetime of synchrotron radiation at\ncm wavelengths (Rybicki & Lightman 1979), such emission is\nmore spread out along the pc scale of the jets up to distances >\n5 milli-arcseconds (Pollack et al. 2003; Lister & Homan 2005).\nMoreover, owing to synchrotron opacity, the bright cm wavelength emission from compact cores in AGN lies in regions\nfarther downstream in the jet than at mm wavelengths (e.g.,\nLobanov 1998; Marscher 2006; Jorstad et al. 2007).\nIn the absence of a large mm-VLBI polarimetric survey, the\nstatistical analysis of a single-dish polarization-mm survey can\nyield relevant insights into the intrinsic polarization properties\nof the innermost compact regions of relativistic jets in AGN.\nHere we present the results from the first 3.5 mm polarimetric\nsurvey over a large (> 100 source) sample of radio loud AGN.\nOur results are also a valuable resource for surveys dedi6\n\ncated to studies of the polarization properties of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), specially that conducted by the\nESA's Planck mission (see the mission Bluebook6). For such\nstudies, radio loud AGN are considered the most important\nCMB-foreground contributors away from the Galactic plane at\n< 0.5\u25e6 up to \u223c 100 GHz observing frequency\nangular scales \u223c\n(Tucci et al. 2005). Hence, a priori knowledge of their polarization is important to account for their contribution to the\npolarization of the CMB data (e.g., Rubi\u00f1o-Mart\u00edn et al. 2010;\nL\u00f3pez-Caniego et al. 2009).\n2. THE SAMPLE\n\nIn Table 1 we present our sample of 145 observed sources\n(see also Fig. 1). This sample has been built essentially from\nthe 138 radio loud AGN in the IRAM pointing source list. Such\nlist comes from the sample of \u223c 300 radio-to-mm flat-spectrum\ncompact AGN visible from the IRAM 30 m Telescope selected\nby Steppe et al. (1988) that were contained in the 1 Jy catalog (K\u00fchr et al. 1981) and/or in the catalog of positions, structures, and polarizations of 404 compact radio sources by Perley\n(1982).\nFrom this sample, Steppe et al. (1992, 1993) and Reuter et al.\n(1997) selected the brightest 138 AGN sources measured by the\nIRAM 30 m AGN monitoring program with a typical flux den> 1 Jy at \u223c 90 GHz and a minimum at S \u223c 0.5 Jy in\nsity S90 \u223c\n90\nthe time span from 1978 to 1994. After removing the 4 sources\nwith J2000.0 declination < \u221230\u25e6 (too low to be observed at the\n30 m Telescope above 20\u25e6 elevation), we complemented our\nsample with 11 new sources not contained in the IRAM pointing source catalog but strong enough currently to be considered\nwithin the selection criteria for such a catalog.\nSince the sample by Steppe et al. (1992, 1993) and\nReuter et al. (1997) was essentially defined to be flux density\n> 1 Jy from 1978 to 1994, our sample was exlimited at S90 \u223c\npected to be complete in that sense. Most likely because of\nsource variability, 54 (19) sources in our sample have measured\nflux densities S86 <1 Jy (S86 <0.5 Jy), hence not matching, at\nthe observing epoch, the constraints imposed for the 1978 to\n1994 time span.\nTo have a raw estimate of the number of radio loud AGN\n> 1 Jy that we may have missed in our sample, we\nwith S86 \u223c\ncompared it with the 5\u2013Year WMAP Point Source Catalog\n(WMAP5, Wright et al. 2009). From this catalog, we find 28\nsources with J2000.0 declination \u2265 \u221230\u25e6 , and with flux density\nlarger than 1 Jy at 90 GHz but not contained in our sample. In\ncontrast, our sample contains 20 sources with S86 >1 Jy that are\nnot found in WMAP5. All but one of these are low Galactic\nlatitude sources, which reflects the bias of the WMAP5 catalog\nthat excludes sources near the Galactic plane.\nAssuming that a 1 Jy flux\u2013limited complete sample of radio\nloud AGN above \u221230\u25e6 dec. contains all sources with S86 >1 Jy\nboth in our sample (i.e. 91), and in WMAP5, we only miss\n24 % of eligible sources. Thus, although this does not allow\nus to claim completeness of our sample to the 1 Jy total flux\ndensity limit, the relatively small fraction of missing sources,\ntogether with the unprecedented large size of our 86 GHz polarization sample, allows us to rely on the results derived from\nit as long as subsample selection does not lead to unacceptably\nsmall number statistics, which is not the case for any of our\nsubsamples (see below).\nIn a survey like ours, polarization non-detection is a relevant\n\nwww.rssd.esa.int/SA/PLANCK/docs/Bluebook-ESA-SCI(2005)1_V2.pdf\n\n\fA 3.5 mm Polarimetric Survey of Radio-loud Active Galactic Nuclei\nbias that may be introduced by source variability when the total\nflux density of a considerable fraction of the sample decreases.\nHowever, we have checked that we are not very much affected\nby such bias. Among our 91 sources with S86 \u22651 Jy, 77 % were\ndetected in linear polarization, whereas for the 54 sources with\nS86 <1 Jy, the fraction of linear polarization detections is similar (74 %).\nGiven the spectral criteria applied to select the sources for the\nIRAM pointing source list, our sample is dominated by radioto-mm flat-spectrum compact AGN, i.e., by blazars. To be more\nspecific, it contains 107 quasars, 26 BL Lac objects, and 6 radio\ngalaxies, with 6 unclassified sources, i.e., not contained in the\nV\u00e9ron-Cetty & V\u00e9ron (2006) catalog. The sample also contains\n32 sources in the Large Area Telescope (LAT, Atwood et al.\n2009) \u03b3-ray bright AGN source sample (LBAS). The LBAS list\ncontains sources detected by LAT onboard the Fermi Gammaray Space Telescope during its first 3 months of operation (i.e.,\nthose in Tables 1 and 2 of Abdo et al. 2009). These 32 LBAS\nsources include 19 quasars, 12 BL Lacs, and, 1 radio galaxy.\nNote that out of the 117 LBAS sources in Abdo et al. (2009),\nonly 97 are visible from the 30 m Telescope with declination\n> \u221230\u25e6 . Among these 97, 32 (33 %) are in our 3.5 mm sample. The source redshift in the sample ranges from z = 0.004\nto z = 3.408, with mean and median z\u0304 = 0.941 and z\u0303 = 0.815,\nrespectively.\nHence, our sample is adequate for studies of the mm polarimetric properties of quasar and BL Lac blazars, and of their\nrelation with their \u03b3-ray properties. Both the MOJAVE and\nour samples were selected primarily based on the flatness of\nsource radio spectra. Hence, both of these are dominated by the\nsame kind of sources, i.e., blazars. Among the 133 sources in\nthe Lister & Homan (2005) MOJAVE sample, 94 (71 %) are in\nour sample as well. Both samples, and the results derived from\nthem, can hence be directly compared, as we do throughout this\npaper.\n3. OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION\n\nThe observations were performed with the XPOL polarimeter (Thum et al. 2008) on the IRAM 30 m Telescope, by making use of the Observatory's orthogonal linearly polarized A100\nand B100 heterodyne receivers tuned at 86 GHz (3.5 mm). The\nmain observing block was performed on July 2005. To complete the list of observed sources, a small number of measurements had to be performed in a time block in September 2005\nor at different epochs between 2006 and 2009 within different\nobserving programs; see Table 2.\nAll observations were performed under the standard XPOL\nset-up and calibration scheme discussed in Thum et al. (2008).\nEvery XPOL polarization measurement consisted of a series of wobbler switching on-offs with typical integration times\n> 4 min., depending on the source's total flux density. Every\npolarization integration was preceded by a cross-scan pointing\nof the telescope and an amplitude, phase, and decorrelation loss\npolarization-specific calibration measurement (see Thum et al.\n2008).\nTo estimate the remaining instrumental polarization to be\nsubtracted from the data (a posteriori), we made measurements\nof strong, compact and unpolarized sources at almost every observing epoch. For 86 GHz observations at the 30 m Telescope,\nthe HPBW of the beam is \u223c28\", hence an object with an ap< 4\") can be safely considered as compact for\nparent size of ( \u223c\nour purposes. As a rule, we used Mars, Uranus, and Neptune\n\n3\n\nas instrumental polarization calibrators. When not available,\nother planets with up to \u223c12\" at the time of the observation\n(e.g., Venus), the compact H II regions W3 OH, K3-50A ,and\nNGC 7538, and the planetary nebula NGC 7027, were observed\nfor cross-check.\nThe output of every polarization observation consists of a\nwide band (640 MHz) spectral measurement from both the\nA100 and B100 receivers, together with the real and imaginary part of their cross-correlation. These four observables are\nneeded to recover the 4 Stokes parameters for each measurement as described in Thum et al. (2008). After the observations,\nthe polarization calibration measurements were used to calibrate the amplitudes of the A100 and B100 measurements, their\nrelative phase, and the decorrelation losses. Such calibrations\nwere applied within the MIRA and CLASS software packages\ninside GILDAS. The instrumental polarization for every ob< 2 %, |U | < 0.5 %, and |V | < 0.5 %) was\nserving epoch (|Qi | \u223c\ni \u223c\ni \u223c\nthen estimated and removed from the data. The CJy/K = 6.4 Jy/K\ncalibration factor for 86 GHz observations at the 30 m Telescope (e.g., Agudo et al. 2006b) was also applied to the total\nflux density measurements (S86 ). At this stage, the uncertainties\nin every specific measurement only account for statistical uncertainties on the average of data along the spectral bandwidth.\nThe final errors in the total flux density measurements were\ncomputed by adding quadratically a 5 % systematic factor coming from the uncertainties in CJy/K (Agudo et al. 2006b). In this\nstage, the remaining polarimetric non-systematic errors, which\ndetermine our polarimetric precision, were estimated from the\ndispersion in the Q, U, and V Stokes parameters from our main\nunpolarized calibrators, i.e. Mars and Uranus. These dispersion estimates (\u2206Qi =0.5 %, \u2206Ui =0.3 %, and \u2206Vi =0.1 %) were\nalso added in quadrature to provide the final uncertainty for every polarization measurement. The latter translate into final\npolarization-uncertainty medians of \u2206m\u0303L \u22480.53 %, \u2206\u03c7\u0303 \u22485 \u25e6 ,\nand \u2206m\u0303C \u22480.2 % for the linear polarization degree (mL ), the\nlinear polarization electric vector position angle (\u03c7), and the circular polarization degree (mC ), respectively. The uncertainties\nof our best measurements are dominated by \u2206Qi , \u2206Ui , and \u2206Vi ,\nand hence their final uncertainties are \u2206mL \u22480.5 %, \u2206\u03c7 \u22481.5 \u25e6 ,\nand \u2206mC \u22480.1 %.\n4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nIn Table 2 we present the observing epoch and integration\ntime for every source in our sample, as well as the observational\nresults, expressed in terms of S86 , mL , \u03c7, and mC . A 3\u03c3 upper\nlimit in both mL and mC is given whenever the measurement did\nnot exceed such 3\u03c3 value. Note that whereas linear polarization\nwas detected from most sources in our sample (76 %), circular\npolarization could be detected only for a small fraction of them\n(6 %).\nStatistical analysis and discussion of the relevant aspects regarding these data are presented in the following sub-sections.\n4.1. Total Flux Density\n4.1.1. Total Luminosity\nFig. 2 shows the 86 GHz luminosity (L = 4\u03c0dL2 S86 (1 + z)\u22121 ,\nwhere dL is the luminosity distance for a Ho = 71 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 ,\n\u03a9m = 0.27 and \u03a9\u039b = 0.73 cosmology, used hereafter) as a function of redshift for our sample, with most - all but 19 sources\n- above the S86 = 0.5 Jy threshold in the observer's frame.\nOnly 6 sources in our sample displayed S86 > 5 Jy. As expected\nby the dependence of L on cosmological distance, quasars, the\n\n\f4\n\nAgudo et al.\n\nmost distant AGN class, show the largest luminosities (with median L\u0303Q = 3.1 \u00d7 1027 W/Hz), followed by BL Lac objects (L\u0303B =\n2.7 \u00d7 1026 W/Hz), and radio galaxies (L\u0303G = 3.8 \u00d7 1024 W/Hz),\nthe closest AGN (see also Fig. 3).\nThe LBAS sources in our sample show an L distribution\nwhich is apparently different from that of non-LBAS sources\n(Fig. 3). The median and peak luminosities of LBAS sources\npeak\n(L\u0303LBAS = 2.4 \u00d7 1027 W/Hz, LLBAS\nwithin [3, 10] \u00d7 1027 W/Hz)\nare larger than those for non-LBAS ones (L\u0303non\u2212LBAS = 1.9 \u00d7\npeak\n1027 W/Hz, Lnon\u2212LBAS\nwithin [1, 3] \u00d7 1027 W/Hz). However, the\nKolmogorov\u2013Smirnov (K-S) test does not give a sufficiently\nhigh confidence level (i.e., 70.7 %) to conclude that both distributions are selected from different parent distributions7 .\nComparison of the luminosity of \u03b3-ray classes of quasars\nand BL Lacs separately (Fig. 4) shows that LBAS quasars\nin our sample are apparently more luminous (L\u0303LBASquasars =\npeak\n7.0 \u00d7 1027 W/Hz, LLBASquasars\nwithin [3, 10] \u00d7 1027 W/Hz)\nthan non-LBAS quasars (L\u0303non\u2212LBASquasars = 2.7 \u00d7 1027 W/Hz,\npeak\nLnon\u2212LBASquasars\nwithin [1, 3] \u00d7 1027 W/Hz), whereas BL Lacs\nshow similar median luminosities and luminosity distributions\nindependently of their \u03b3-ray properties. Indeed, the K-S test\nshows that the distributions of LBAS and non-LBAS quasars\nare significantly different (within a 99.0 % confidence level of\nboth being drawn from different parent distributions), whereas\nLBAS and non-LBAS BL Lacs are not (confidence level only\n13.8 %).\nNote that, for the computation of the confidence level of rejection of the null hypothesis in the K-S test, the effective number of data points (Ne )8 , must be \u2265 4 to rely on the K-S test\n(Press et al. 1992). All K-S tests presented in this paper, including the one for LBAS and non-LBAS BL Lacs mentioned\nabove (with Ne = 5.7), fulfill this requirement.\nLister et al. (2009) found that among the 26 MOJAVE AGN\ncontained in the LBAS sample, quasars have, on average,\nfaster superluminal features than non-LBAS quasars. They\nalso report evidence of faster superluminal proper motions in\n\u03b3-ray variable LBAS AGN with regard to non variable ones.\nKovalev et al. (2009) report a correlation of the \u03b3-ray photon\nflux of 77 LBAS sources with contemporaneous VLBA or single dish flux density at 15 GHz. They also show that LBAS\nsources observed in their 15 GHz VLBA sample display, in\ngeneral, larger compact radio flux densities, larger brightness\ntemperatures of their parsec-scale cores, and more active radio\nstates than non-LBAS sources. These results are in good agreement with previous findings based on EGRET data suggesting that \u03b3-ray bright blazars posses larger Doppler factors than\nweak ones (Jorstad et al. 2001a,b; L\u00e4hteenm\u00e4ki & Valtaoja\n2003; Kellermann et al. 2004). However, Lister et al. (2009)\nalso suggest that the relativistic Doppler factor is not the sole\nparameter controlling the \u03b3-ray properties of blazars.\nOur results are consistent with previous claims suggesting\nthat \u03b3-ray bright blazars have larger Doppler factors than weak\n\u03b3-ray blazars, but we can only confirm the larger luminosity of\n\u03b3-ray bright quasars against \u03b3-weak quasars, and no significant\ndifference for BL Lacs.\nWe note, though, that our 86 GHz observations were not performed contemporaneously with the Fermi-LAT \u03b3-ray obser7\n8\n9\n\nvations by Abdo et al. (2009), and the luminosity distributions\nof LBAS and non\u2013LBAS sources presented here (specially for\nBL Lacs) may appear broader by 3 mm source variability, thus\nhiding actual trends (see \u00a7 4.4).\n4.1.2. 15 GHz to 86 GHz Spectral Index\nThe spectral index between two observing frequencies\n(\u03b1\u03bd1 ,\u03bd2 = log(S\u03bd1 /S\u03bd2 )/log(\u03bd1/\u03bd2 )) in the radio\u2013mm spectral\nrange provides information about the synchrotron opacity between such observing frequencies (\u03bd1 ,\u03bd2 ) affecting the radiation from an emitting jet region. For the 15 GHz and 86 GHz\nemission in radio loud AGN, the emitting regions are not cospatial in general (see Section 1). Hence, for most sources, the\n\u03b115,86 determination is biased towards larger (more optically\nthick) spectral indices. This is because the innermost 86 GHz\njet emitting regions are usually opaque to 15 GHz radiation.\nWith this in mind, we performed an \u03b115,86 study of our main\nsubsamples only to study the relative differences among them.\nFor this, we used only those sources in our sample with available 15 GHz total flux densities from integrated intensities of\nMOJAVE VLBA images9 . To try to avoid biasing the computation of \u03b115,86 owing to source variability, we selected, for each\nsource, the MOJAVE observation closest in time to our 86 GHz\nmeasurement.\nThe \u03b115,86 distributions for each one of the source samples\nconsidered in this paper are shown in Fig. 5. Even when affected by the above mentioned bias, the spectral indices for the\nwhole source sample are distributed towards flat and optically\nthin spectral indices (with \u03b115,86 median \u03b1\u030315,86 = \u22120.23, as expected from the definition of the sample and the high observing\nfrequency), with a small fraction of sources (18 %) showing\nflat to optically thick spectral index. Quasars and non-LBAS\nsources posses \u03b115,86 distributions similar to those of the entire\nquasar\nnon\u2212LBAS\nsource sample (\u03b1\u030315,86 = \u22120.27, \u03b1\u030315,86\n= \u22120.26). However,\nboth BL Lacs and LBAS sources clearly distribute spectral indices more uniformly over an almost symmetric range of \u03b115,86\nin [\u22120.7, 0.6]. This points out that BL Lac and LBAS sources\ntend to show considerably flatter mm spectra (partially optically\nthick) than quasars and non-LBAS sources, respectively. The\nsignificance of this result is guaranteed by the K-S test, which\npoints out that the \u03b115,86 distributions for quasars and BL Lacs\nin Fig. 5 are different (at 99.4 % confidence level), as well as\nthose for LBAS and non-LBAS subsamples (within a 96.9 %\nconfidence level). We note that quasars in the LBAS subsample\nare dominated by sources with spectral indices above \u03b1\u0303quasar\n15,86 ,\nwhereas LBAS BL Lacs have a more spread \u03b115,86 distribution\nalong the ranges of the entire BL Lac subsample.\nIn principle, the spectral differences shown by radio loud\nquasars and BL Lacs in our analysis would be expected if jets in\nBL Lacs would be preferentially oriented towards smaller viewing angles (with regard to the line of sight). In this case, the integrated radiation coming from different spectral components is\nexpected to flatten the spectrum (e.g., Cotton et al. 1980). However, recent work (Hovatta et al. 2009; Pushkarev et al. 2009)\nhas concluded that flat spectrum radio quasars have significantly smaller viewing angles than BL Lac objects, which is\nexpected to produce the reverse spectral behavior from that observed by us. In this case, we can attribute more confidently\nthe average spectral differences shown by quasars and BL Lacs\n\nAs usual, only confidence levels \u2265 95.0 % will be considered sufficiently high to claim that two distributions are significantly different throughout this paper.\nNe = N1 N2 /(N1 + N2 ), where Ni is the number of points on each sample, as defined by Press et al. (1992)\nhttp://www.physics.purdue.edu/MOJAVE\n\n\fA 3.5 mm Polarimetric Survey of Radio-loud Active Galactic Nuclei\nin Fig. 5 to the larger cosmological redshifts of quasars (see\nFig. 3), which shift their spectra to lower frequencies in the observer's frame. This preferentially reveals the optically thin part\nof the synchrotron spectrum of quasars with regard to BL Lacs.\nAlso, we cannot rule out differences in the intrinsic spectral\nproperties of the emitting particle populations between these\ntwo source classes.\nThe means of the viewing angles of LBAS and non-LBAS\nsources contained in Table 1 of Pushkarev et al. (2009) are not\nstatistically significant according to their Student's T-test. This\ndoes not allow us to attribute the spectral differences between\nthese two subsamples to preferential alignment of \u03b3-ray bright\nblazar jets with the line of sight, although this possibility cannot be ruled out based on only this information. Intrinsic differences in the properties of the synchrotron-emitting particle populations of these two subsamples, as well as source redshifts,\ncan, in principle, be relevant as well.\n4.2. Linear Polarization\nFractional linear polarization at 86 GHz (mL ) was detected\nfor 110 sources, 76 % of our sample. When comparing the median values of mL (m\u0303L ) for the major optical classes, we find that\nBL Lac objects, with m\u0303L = 4.4 %, are more strongly polarized\nthan quasars, with m\u0303L = 3.1 %. To avoid biassing the m\u0303L values,\n3\u03c3mL upper limits were considered for the cases when mL could\nnot be detected. Otherwise, if the non-detections are not accounted for when calculating the medians, m\u0303L would be overestimated by \u223c 1\u20131.5 %10 . The difference between the quasar and\nthe BL Lac mL distributions is confirmed by the Gehan's generalized Wilcoxon (GGW) test at a 95.2 % confidence level. To\nperform this test, which takes into account both detections and\nupper limits, we used the ASURV 1.2 survival analysis package\n(see Lavalley et al. 1992, and references therein).\nThis result (i.e., quasars less polarized at 86 GHz, in general, than BL Lacs) does not seem consistent with quasars having a significantly thinner synchrotron spectrum than BL Lacs\nbetween 15 and 86 GHz. This is expected to reduce mL for\nBL Lacs with regard to quasars owing to stronger synchrotron\nself-absorption in BL Lacs. Hence, the radio-to-mm spectral\nproperties of quasars and BL Lacs cannot explain their overall linear polarization properties. In contrast, an explanation\ncomes from recent evidence that the viewing angle of jets in\nquasars is smaller than that in BL Lacs (Hovatta et al. 2009;\nPushkarev et al. 2009). If either the magnetic field is not homogeneously distributed along the jet or the jet has prominent\nnon-axysimmetry, lower polarization degree is expected from\nsources better oriented to the line of sight (i.e., quasars) owing\nto cancellation of orthogonal polarization components.\nInterestingly, the mL distribution of the entire source sample\nis double peaked (Fig. 6), with the first peak at mL \u2248 2.5 %,\nand the second one at mL \u2248 4 %. At lower polarization degrees, a similar bimodal distribution was previously observed\nby Lister & Homan (2005) for the cores of quasars and the integrated polarization degree of EGRET-detected blazars. Fig. 6\nshows that this double peak in our data might come from the\nquasar subsample, which dominates the overall sample.\nTo test whether this dichotomy is produced by the presence of radio loud quasars with high optical polarization (HPQ,\n\u2265 3 %) and radio quasars with low optical polarization (LPQ,\n< 3 %) in our sample, we have also analyzed these two sub10\n\n5\n\nsamples separately (see Fig. 6). We considered HPQ as those\nsources in the V\u00e9ron-Cetty & V\u00e9ron (2006) catalog with such\na label, and LPQ as the remainder of sources in that catalog.\nSimple inspection of Fig. 6 apparently shows that if there is a\nphysical meaning on the two\u2013peaked quasar distribution, it cannot be because of HPQ producing the higher mL peak and the\nLPQ the one at lower mL . Indeed, there is no statistically significant difference between the HPQ and LPQ mL distributions\nthat could confirm such a hypothesis (the GGW test gives only\na 21.4 % confidence).\nA similar double peak is seen in the mL distribution for the\nLBAS source sample (Fig. 6), whereas the second peak is not so\nevident in the non-LBAS source mL distribution. This might be\ninterpreted as suggesting that this bimodal distribution comes\nfrom \u03b3-ray bright quasars. However, according to our GGW\ntest, there is no significant difference between the mL distributions of LBAS and non-LBAS sources (36.9 % confidence\nonly).\nThus our analysis remains inconclusive about the origin of\nthe apparent polarization degree dichotomy.\n4.2.1. 86 GHz to 15 GHz Fractional Linear Polarization Ratio\nThe fraction of linear polarization detections in our sample is \u223c 76 %. Considering that we adopted a 3\u03c3 criterion\nfor detection (with median 3\u03c3\u0303mL \u223c 1.6 % over the whole sample), this means that, on average, \u223c76 % of our sources display\n> 1.6 % at 86 GHz. However, only 60 % of sources both in\nmL \u223c\nthe MOJAVE and in our sample show 15 GHz fractional linear\n> 1.6 %. This points to a general trend of blazars\npolarization \u223c\nto increase their linear polarization degree with frequency, as\npreviously suggested by Agudo et al. (2006b) and Jorstad et al.\n(2007). Indeed, those sources for which linear polarization was\ndetected both in our survey and in the integrated emission of the\nMOJAVE images (Lister & Homan 2005) follow a clear general\ntrend to show significantly larger fractional linear polarization\nat 86 GHz than at 15 GHz by a median factor \u2248 2 (Fig. 7). The\nsame factor \u2248 2 is obtained if our mL data is compared with\nthe linear polarization degree of the core at 15 GHz (mcore\nL,15 ) as\nmeasured by Lister & Homan (2005) (Fig. 8).\nNote also that there is a prominent 22 % (24 %) fraction of\nthe entire source sample with larger mL /mL,15 (mL /mcore\nL,15 ) ratio than 4. This tail of large 86 GHz linear polarization excess seems to be present in all subsamples of optical and \u03b3-ray\nclasses, although BL Lacs do not show it clearly, perhaps because of the lower number of sources in that subsample.\nThis result may be explained by a combination of two phenomena, that the 86 GHz emission in blazars comes from a region with greater degree of order of the magnetic field than the\none at 15 GHz, and that the 15 GHz emission from blazars is affected by considerably greater Faraday depolarization relative\nto the 86 GHz emission.\nIf the former hypothesis is true, it would imply that the magnetic field order in the inner regions of the relativistic jets is\nlarger than in outer regions. For this statement, we assume that\nthe bulk of the 86 GHz emission comes on average from inner\njet regions where 15 GHz emission is strongly affected by synchrotron opacity, hence locating the 15 GHz core farther downstream (e.g., Jorstad et al. 2007).\nDespite the apparent differences between the source subsamples presented in each of Fig. 7 and 8 (see also above), our K-S\n\nNote that assigning different values to the non-detected mL does not have an effect on the resulting median, provided that all estimates of mL are smaller than m\u0303L ,\nas is the case for all considered subsamples.\n\n\f6\n\nAgudo et al.\n\ntest does not allow us to claim any significant differences between the mL /mL,15 or mL /mcore\nL,15 distributions either for quasars\nversus BL Lacs (confidence level only 84.5 %, and 53.9 %,\nrespectively), or for LBAS against non-LBAS sources (confidence level only 85.1 %, and 59.5 %, respectively).\n4.2.2. Total Luminosity vs. Linear Polarization\nFig. 9 shows the 86 GHz luminosity vs. 86 GHz fractional\nlinear polarization for sources with known redshift in the entire\nsource sample and in the four major optical and \u03b3\u2013ray classes\nconsidered here. Our correlation analysis for data containing\nupper limits - performed with the ASURV 1.2 package by\nLavalley et al. (1992) - shows significant correlation between\nL and mL for the whole source sample. This is supported by the\nresults of the Cox, Kendall's \u03c4 , and Spearman's \u03c1 tests. These\nindicate that L and mL are correlated at 98.8 %, 99.2 %, and\n98.7 % confidence level, respectively. Significant correlation\nis also found for the case of the non-LBAS subsample - at\n98.4 %, 97.0 %, and 96.7 % confidence levels, respectively.\nHowever, for the quasar subsample - with confidence levels\nof 87.7 %, 93.3 %, and 91.1 % for the Cox, the Kendall's \u03c4 , and\nthe Spearman's \u03c1 tests, respectively -, no formally significant\ncorrelation is found. Perhaps because of their decreased sizes,\nthe correlation tests over the BL Lac and the LBAS yield confidence levels of correlation of these subsamples that are even\nmuch lower.\nUnder the standard assumption that, in the absence of strong\nFaraday depolarization (which we assume to be the case for our\n3.5 mm observations, see Section 1), higher degree of linear polarization reflects greater magnetic field order, we have found\nthat the magnetic field order -in our entire source sample-\nincreases with decreasing mm luminosity.\nA reasonable hypothesis to explain this phenomenon would\nsimply involve orientation and relativistic effects. In principle,\nthose sources whose jets are better oriented to the line of sight\nare expected to display larger luminosities (because of their\nlarger Doppler factors) and also lower linear polarization degrees (because of cancellation of orthogonal polarization components along the line of sight). To test this hypothesis, we\nused the \"variability Doppler factors\" given by Hovatta et al.\n(2009) to compute the beaming corrected luminosities of the\n70 sources in their and our sample. The correlation analysis\nof all source types in Fig. 9 points out that, although the reduced number of sources in every subsample tends to reduce\nthe correlation between Lunbeamed and mL , the decreasing trend\nof Lunbeamed with increasing mL still seems to be present. Despite the reduction of data points, such anti\u2013correlation is now\nstatistically significant for the LBAS subsample (with 99.1 %,\n99.5 %, and 98.4 % confidence level, from the Cox, Kendall's\n\u03c4 , and Spearman's \u03c1 test, respectively), which do not allow us\nto support the beaming scenario as a reliable explanation for the\nL and mL anti\u2013correlation.\nThis may have a plausible alternative interpretation that, although still qualitative and speculative, may be a valid proposal\nto investigate further. The AGN jet regions responsible for the\n3 mm emission are thought to be dominated by plasma dynamics, in contrast to the innermost Poynting flux-dominated jet region, where the collimation and acceleration is assumed to take\nplace (e.g., Jorstad et al. 2007; Marscher et al. 2008, 2010). It\nis known that increasing jet kinetic energies with regard to their\nsurrounding low speed wind favor the generation of fluid instabilities, leading to turbulence, in the region separating the\n\ninner-fast jet and the outer-slow wind (e.g., Mizuno et al. 2007;\nMeliani & Keppens 2009, for different numerical setups for this\nscenario). This picture fits into our observing results. A faster\njet would be more luminous, but would also produce more turbulence in the shear layer where the external wind penetrates\nthe jet, hence reducing the magnetic field order and the linear\npolarization degree.\n4.2.3. Linear Polarization Angle versus Jet Position Angle\nIn Fig. 10 we show the distribution of misalignment of linearpolarization electric-vector position-angle (\u03c7, given in Table 2)\nwith the jet structural position angle (\u03c6jet , given in Table 1),\ni.e., |\u03c7 \u2212 \u03c6jet |, for the entire source sample, and the subsamples\nof quasars, BL Lacs, LBAS, and non-LBAS sources.\nDifferent angular resolutions achieved at different VLBI\nobserving frequencies probe different jet regions that may\nshow, in some particular cases, large \u03c6jet differences (see e.g.,\nAgudo et al. 2007, for the case of NRAO 150 with \u2206\u03c6jet \u2248\n100\u25e6). Opacity effects of the inner jet regions at low frequencies can also impede a reliable determination of |\u03c7 \u2212 \u03c6jet | if \u03c6jet\nis measured at \u03bd << 86 GHz. To try to avoid these biases as\nmuch as possible, we first searched for \u03c6jet values in the 86 GHz\nVLBI Survey by Lee et al. (2008). When 86 GHz VLBI images\nwere not available, the 15 GHz data from either the MOJAVE\nsurvey (Lister & Homan 2005, preferentially) or those from the\n2 cm VLBA Survey (Kellermann et al. 2004) were used. Otherwise, a deeper search was done for every source from references\n1 to 10 on Table 1. The higher frequency result thus found was\nthen adopted.\nFig. 10 shows a weak trend in the entire source sample of\nalignment of \u03c7 close to 0\u25e6 \u201330\u25e6 to \u03c6jet , such that \u03c7 lies almost\nparallel to the jet axis. A similar pattern is found in the quasar\nand non-LBAS subsamples. In contrast, the values of |\u03c7 \u2212 \u03c6jet |\nin the BL Lac and LBAS subsamples tend to lie within the\nranges 10\u25e6 \u201330\u25e6 or 70\u25e6 \u201380\u25e6. However, our K-S tests indicate\nthat there is no significant difference between the quasar and\nthe BL Lac distributions (only 18.7 % confidence to come from\nthe same parent distribution), and between the LBAS and nonLBAS distributions (only 63.9 % confidence).\nWe therefore find no clear trend in any of the source samples considered in this work for \u03c7 to be aligned either parallel\nor perpendicular to \u03c6jet . Actually, even for the entire source\nsample, which shows an apparent preference of aligned \u03c7 parallel to \u03c6jet , there is only a small excess of sources (\u223c25 %)\ndistributed at |\u03c7 \u2212 \u03c6jet | < 30\u25e6 . Similar results are obtained from\nthe quasar and LBAS distributions. Even this \u223c 25 % excess\nmust be interpreted with care. When only highly polarized\nsource states (mL > 3 %) are considered \u2013 which seems to reveal more clearly the \u03c7 to \u03c6jet relation in the case of the quasar\n3C 454.3 (Jorstad et al. 2010) \u2013, such excess is decreased to\n\u223c 18 %. Moreover, Fig. 11 shows that, if the |\u03c7 \u2212 \u03c6jet | distributions are generated from a smaller number of sources (only\nthose brighter than 1.5 Jy at 86 GHz), such an excess disappears\ncompletely. All this shows that if there is a preference to align \u03c7\nparallel to the jets of the sources shown in Fig. 10, such a preference is intrinsically weak at 86 GHz and it is also partially\nhidden by random changes in the |\u03c7 \u2212 \u03c6jet | distributions.\nTheoretically, the electric vector position angle (\u03c7) of the\nlinearly polarized emission from relativistic axisymmetric jets\nshould be observed either parallel or perpendicular to the\njet axis (e.g, Lyutikov et al. 2005; Cawthorne 2006). However, the results from several observational attempts to con-\n\n\fA 3.5 mm Polarimetric Survey of Radio-loud Active Galactic Nuclei\nfirm this bi-modality do not show a robust agreement among\neach other. Gabuzda, Pushkarev, & Cawthorne (2000), through\n5 GHz VLBI observations, reported a tendency of the core and\njets in a set of 25 BL Lac objects to show \u03c7 either parallel (preferentially) or perpendicular to the jet direction. However, on the\none hand, Pollack et al. (2003) found a strong tendency for the\ncores of their observed quasars to possess values of \u03c7 that are\nperpendicular to the jet axis, whereas no correlation was found\nfor the jets in quasars, nor for the jets or cores in BL Lac objects.\nOn the other hand, Lister & Homan (2005) found the cores of\nsources in the MOJAVE sample to show \u03c7 values aligned preferentially parallel to the jet axis, which was found to be a particularly strong tendency for the case of BL Lac objects. Such\na preference was not found in the jets of their sample, although\nBL Lacs did show a better tendency to have \u03c7 aligned with the\njets. The apparent lack of consensus from these studies might\nbe the result of the well known frequency dependent Faraday\nrotation of \u03c7 (e.g., Zavala & Taylor 2004).\nOur 86 GHz polarimetric observations show that there is not\na clear trend in our data for |\u03c7 \u2212 \u03c6jet | to be distributed either near\n\u223c 0\u25e6 or near \u223c 90\u25e6 . This difference between our results and\nthose by Lister & Homan (2005) cannot be attributed to the use\nof \u03c6jet measured at 86 GHz in our analysis. Indeed, for the 40\nsources in our sample having measurements of both \u03c6jet,>43 GHz\nand \u03c6jet,15 GHz , both magnitudes are in general good agreement\n(with Spearman's correlation rank \u03c1 = 0.91 at 99.9 % confidence, and mean of \u03c6jet,>43 GHz \u2212 \u03c6jet,15 GHz \u2248 9\u25e6 ). Also, when\n\u03c6jet,15 GHz is used instead of \u03c6jet,>43 GHz for these 40 sources, the\ndistribution in Fig. 10 does not show noticeable changes.\nThe median (maximum) uncertainty in the determination of\n\u03c7 for those sources in our sample detected in linear polarization\n \u0304 \u2248 4\u25e6 (\u03b4\u03c7max \u2248 9\u25e6 ). Thus, these uncertainties cannot exis \u03b4\u03c7\nplain the lack of a strong trend in our |\u03c7 \u2212 \u03c6jet | distributions for\n\u03c7 to be aligned either parallel or perpendicular to \u03c6jet .\nThe large amplitude and rapid linear polarization variability\nat mm (e.g., Jorstad et al. 2007) and radio wavelengths (e.g.,\nAller et al. 2003, and references therein), for which blazars\nare well known, is certainly an unavoidable effect both in our\n|\u03c7 \u2212 \u03c6jet | study and in those by previous authors (see \u00a7 4.4).\nHowever, we do not find strong arguments supporting a scenario that hides a clear |\u03c7 \u2212 \u03c6jet | trend in our data when allowing for it in previous radio surveys. Considerably larger \u03c7 variability amplitude, or a larger probability to find sources in high\nvariability states at mm wavelengths could certainly explain this\nscenario, but there is still no strong observational support for it,\nas far as the authors know.\nThere is though a likely explanation for the differences between our results and those by Lister & Homan (2005) and\nPollack et al. (2003). Our data, which are essentially free of\nFaraday rotation (see Section 1), suffer from prominent synchrotron opacity well upstream the 15 GHz and 5 GHz cores,\nhence reflecting the properties of inner jet regions than the sections of the jet that radiate predominantly at radio frequencies.\nApart from other biases, differences on the |\u03c7 \u2212 \u03c6jet | distributions a mm and radio wavelengths could be reflecting the properties of the regions from where most of the emission at such\nwavelengths comes from.\nThere is an increasing number of AGN jets where large\nmm-\u03c7 rotations (>> 90\u25e6 ) with typical time scales of days to\nmonths are detected either in the cores or in bright moving\nfeatures (e.g., D'Arcangelo et al. 2007; Larionov et al. 2008;\n11\n\nhttp://www.rssd.esa.int/index.php?project=Planck\n\n7\n\nJorstad et al. 2010). Successful explanation of these phenomena requires non-axisimmetric jet dynamics such as emitting features that propagate down the jet along helical paths\n(Marscher et al. 2008, 2010). Gradients of axisymmetric Faraday rotation screens along the path of moving jet features\nmay also produce large \u03c7 rotations at 7 mm (e.g., G\u00f3mez et al.\n2000, 2001), but much larger than typical RM values (>>\n104 rad m\u22122 ) are required to produce rotations at 3 mm to explain Figs. 10 and 11.\n4.2.4. AGN as Source of Contamination of the 86 GHz Linear\nPolarization CMB\nFig. 6 show that linear polarization of flat spectrum radio\nloud AGN is larger than previously expected from centimeter\nwavelength surveys (e.g., Pollack et al. 2003; Ricci et al. 2004;\nLister & Homan 2005). This is clearly indicated by the excess\nby a factor of \u223c 2 of 86 GHz linear polarization relative to 15\nGHz linear polarization (Fig. 7), which points out that simple\nextrapolation from measurements at cm wavelengths systematically underestimates the CMB-foreground polarization contribution of AGN at 3 mm wavelength. The median fractional\nlinear polarization of detected sources is \u223c 4 % with a considerable population (27 %) showing linear polarization > 5 %\n(Fig. 6). Fig. 12 shows that, at 3 mm wavelengths, linear polarization in radio loud AGN may reach significant values relative\nto the CMB contribution for high sensitivity measurements. Indeed, 62 % (20 %) of our linear polarization detected sources\nshow |Q| or |U| > 50 mJy (> 100 mJy).\nHence, our observing results in Table 2 are relevant, and\ncan be used, to estimate the 3 mm AGN contribution to linear polarization CMB measurements, such as those performed\nby the Planck satellite11 . A new epoch of observations, over\nan improved flux density limited, complete sample, is already\nplanned for mid 2010. This will provide contemporaneous\nmeasurements with those of Planck, as well as the possibility to\nstudy the effects of linear polarization variability on the CMB\nradio loud AGN foregrounds.\n4.3. Circular Polarization\nThe distribution of |mC | for all major samples considered in\nthis paper is presented in Fig. 13. For comparison, we show\nseparately the distributions of |mC | detections (\u2265 3\u03c3), |mC | results \u2265 2\u03c3, and all |mC | measurements (independently of their\nsignificance).\nThe most evident result with regard to circular polarization is\nthe low level of detection in our observations (\u223c 6 %, 8 sources\nout of 145), which prevents us from conducting a statistical\nstudy of circular polarization. This low detection rate is not\nsurprising given the known low degree of circular polarization\n< 0.5 % at 2 cm as\nof blazars at radio wavelengths (typically \u223c\nobserved with VLBI, Homan & Lister 2006) and the minimum\n> 0.3 %).\nmC detection level in our observations (3\u03c3mC \u223c\nOur circular polarization detection rate is lower than half of\nthat of Homan & Lister (2006) (\u223c 15 %), which may be explained by the difference in angular resolution between their\n15 GHz VLBA observations and ours. Homan & Lister (2006)\nshowed that most circular polarization is confined to the core of\nthe sources. If this also applies to the 86 GHz emitting regions,\nour single dish observations (to which all such emitting regions\ncontribute) must reflect lower mC and a lower detection rate for\n> 0.1 %).\nour similar sensitivity to circular polarization (\u03c3mC \u223c\n\n\f8\n\nAgudo et al.\n\nAmong our 8 sources with detected circular polarization,\nonly 3C 84 (0316+413) and 3C 454.3 (2251+158) were also\n> 3\u03c3 by Homan & Lister (2006). They found\ndetected at \u223c\nsignificant circular polarization in the core and in 3 downstream jet emission regions in 3C 84, and in one jet region in\n3C 454.3. The amount and sign of mC measured in 2003 by\nHoman & Lister (2006) in the core of 3C 84 is not consistent\nwith our single dish measurement in 2005. Note though that the\nVLBI measurement by Homan & Lister (2006), who detected\nstrong circular polarization with opposite sign than in the core\nwithin a nearby jet region, may not be comparable with our single dish measurement. In contrast, both mC and its sign in the\ncore of 3C 454.3 as measured by Homan & Lister's, and our\nmeasurements are consistent, despite the extreme mm flare displayed by this source during our observations (e.g., Raiteri et al.\n2008; Jorstad et al. 2010). These discrepancies, as well as the\nfact that our circular polarization detections do not agree in general with those by Homan & Lister (2006), is consistent with\nthe known circular polarization variability in radio loud AGN\n(e.g., Aller et al. 2003), which may differ considerably at different observing frequencies (e.g., Homan et al. 2009).\nCircular polarization in AGN jets may be generated either\nby intrinsically circularly polarized synchrotron radiation, or\nby Faraday conversion of linear into circular polarization \u2013 see\nWardle & Homan (2003) and Homan et al. (2009) for detailed\nreviews of the different magnetic field configurations and conditions suitable for both mechanisms. Both mechanisms have a\ndependence with the emitting wavelength (\u03bb), that conspires to\nreduce mC with decreasing \u03bb, hence providing an additional explanation for the low level of mC detection in our observations.\nHowever, whereas for the intrinsic mechanism mC int \u221d \u03bb1/2 ,\nfor Faraday conversion the dependence is much more stronger,\nmC F \u221d \u03bb5 under the assumptions adopted by Wardle & Homan\n(2003). Hence, whereas mC int at 3 mm is only \u223c 2 times lower\nthan at 2 cm, mC F is reduced by a factor \u223c 6, 000. Additionally,\nsome of the Faraday conversion scenarios invoked in the literature (Wardle & Homan 2003; Ruszkowski & Begelman 2002;\nBeckert & Falcke 2002; Homan et al. 2009) involve Faraday\nrotation (internal to the jet), that has a \u2206\u03c7F \u221d \u03bb2 dependence. All of these considerations render the Faraday conversion mechanism less suitable to explain the circular polarization\ndetected at 3 mm. Otherwise it would be difficult to explain\nthat the amount of circular polarization detected in our obser< |m | < 0.7 %, is similar to that detected in the\nvations, 0.3 % \u223c\nC \u223c\nMOJAVE survey at 2 cm (Homan & Lister 2006).\n4.4. Influence of Source Variability\nIt is well known that radio loud AGN display in the mm\nrange (as in other spectral ranges) abrupt total flux density variability by up to maxima of \u223c 1 order of magnitude and time\nscales from months (Jorstad et al. 2005; Ter\u00e4sranta et al. 2005;\nFuhrmann et al. 2008) to days (Agudo et al. 2006b). Such\nvariability is usually connected with the ejection of superluminal emission features from the innermost jet regions (e.g.,\nJorstad et al. 2005; Kadler et al. 2008; Perucho et al. 2008).\nThe Doppler factor of the source affects its variability time scale\nin the observer's frame through a directly proportional relation,\nwhereas the cosmological redshift slows down such time scale\nby a factor (1 + z)\u22121.\nJorstad et al. (2005) made a study of the (7, 3, and 1) millimeter polarization variability of 15 radio loud AGN monitored during \u223c 3 yr. They identify different classes of vari-\n\nable sources, with the most variable one displaying excursions\nof up to \u223c 1 order of magnitude in linear polarization degree, and > 90\u25e6 in linear polarization angle in time scales of\nmonths or even weeks (see also Jorstad et al. 2010, for a case\nof mm and optical polarimetric correlation in 3C 454.3). At\n7 mm, shorter mL and \u03c7 variability time scales of less than a\nweek \u2013 but for smaller variability amplitudes \u2013 are reported\nby D'Arcangelo et al. (2007, 2009), for the case of the blazars\nPKS 0420\u2212014, and OJ 287.\nHowever, not all radio loud AGN vary as much as in these\nextreme cases. There seems to be a gradient of variability amplitude and time scales, which is likely related to the intrinsic\nproperties of every source. Anyhow, source variability is an\nunavoidable effect that influences our results, as well as those\nfrom any other survey at which AGN display significant variability. Such influence on the selection of our sample and its\ncompleteness was discussed in \u00a7 1.\nFor the large number of objects in different variability states,\nour distributions of S86 , mL , and \u03c7 are expected to broaden\ntheir shapes or to decrease their correlation between them and\nwith other variables, hence conspiring to hidden possible significant results from them. However, for such a large sample\nlike ours, we do not expect that variability can fake the statistical results by shifting the distributions towards a particular\ntrend. From that point of view, we are confident on the results\nin previous sections, which significance and extension to other\nsubsamples could perhaps have been more ample without the\ninfluence of variability. This is extensive to the studies of \u03b115,86\nand mL /mL,15 in \u00a7 4.1.2 and 4.2.3, respectively. The extra variability at 15 GHz that we could not account for introduces extra\nwidening of the distributions against significant statistical results. Even in that case, we were able to obtain some significant\nresults.\n5. CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have performed the first large 3.5 mm polarization survey of radio loud AGN over a sample of 145 bright and flat\nradio spectrum sources, dominated by blazars, observed with\nthe IRAM 30 m Telescope. At such wavelengths, Faraday rotation and depolarization are expected to have a weak effect on\nthe observed linear polarization, which thus reflects the intrinsic\nlinear polarization properties of the sources with high fidelity.\nWe detect linear and circular polarization above 3\u03c3 levels for\n76 % and 6 % of the sample, respectively. We have shown that\nthe fractional linear polarization at 86 GHz clearly exceeds that\nat 15 GHz by a factor of \u223c 2 for all classes of sources considered here. This implies both a larger degree of magnetic field\norder in the region where the bulk of the 86 GHz emission is\nproduced, and considerable Faraday depolarization at 15 GHz,\nalthough we can not quantify the relative magnitude of these\neffects with the present data.\nConsistent with previous work suggesting that the class of\n\u03b3-ray bright blazars possess, in general, larger Doppler factors\nthan weaker \u03b3-ray bright blazars, we have found that LBAS\nquasars from our sample are more luminous than non-LBAS\nquasars. However, our data do not allow us to claim differences\nin the luminosity distributions of LBAS and non-LBAS BL Lac\nobjects.\nOur entire source sample shows a trend of lower total flux\nluminosity for larger degrees of linear polarization, indicating\nthat the level of magnetic field order in the innermost jet emitting regions is anti-correlated with jet luminosity.\n\n\fA 3.5 mm Polarimetric Survey of Radio-loud Active Galactic Nuclei\nUnlike other authors, who observed at radio frequencies\n(hence affected by Faraday rotation), we do not find a clear relation between the linear polarization angle and the jet structural\nposition angle of BL Lacs. This is also true for the remainder of the source subsamples considered in this work, despite\nthe tendency of the electric-vector linear polarization angle to\nalign with the jet position angle found at radio frequencies on\nquasars. This implies that the sources in our sample do not\ncontain the conditions required for their linear polarization angles to lie either parallel or perpendicular to the jet axis (in the\nobserver's frame), i.e., that they have a markedly non axisymmetric character. Indeed, the 3-dimensional character of a nonnegligible population of jets in AGN at different scales is known\nto be complex (e.g., Fomalont et al. 2000; Pollack et al. 2003;\nJorstad et al. 2005; Lister & Homan 2005; Agudo et al. 2006a,\n2007).\nIn the case of purely axisymmetric jets, cancellation of linearly polarized emission parallel and perpendicular to the jet\naxis forces \u03c7 to align only either parallel, or perpendicular to\nthe axis (e.g, Lyutikov et al. 2005; Cawthorne 2006). Our results contradict this phenomenology, which suggests that the\ntheoretical requirements for relativistic jets to show such behavior are not satisfied when observed at 3 mm. This implies that\nthe 3 mm emitting region in relativistic jets in blazars is primarily non axially-symmetric at this wavelength. Hence, either the\nmagnetic field or the emitting particle distributions (or both)\nresponsible for the synchrotron radiation at 3 mm in a large\nfraction of blazars must have a markedly 3 dimensional (nonaxisimmetric) character in order to account for the |\u03c7 \u2212 \u03c6jet | distributions of our observations.\nWe have shown that the circularly polarized emission detected from our observations is most likely generated by in-\n\n9\n\ntrinsic synchrotron emission. This has an important consequence. Intrinsic circular polarization cannot be produced in\npure pair (electron-positron, e+ e\u2212 ) plasma jets. Thus, sources\nin which such mechanisms govern circular polarization production must be composed, at least in part, by an electron-proton\n(p+ e\u2212 ) plasma. This may be taken as a tool for AGN jet composition diagnostics through future mm wavelength polarimetric\nsurveys. If a large fraction of sources show mC with moduli as\nlarge as those detected at cm wavelengths, this may imply that\ntheir mm jet emitting regions are primarily composed of p+ e\u2212\nplasma.\nThe authors acknowledge the anonymous referee for his/her\nconstructive revision of this paper, which allowed us to improve it considerably.
