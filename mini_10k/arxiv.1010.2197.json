Spiegel\ndsp@astro.princeton.edu\nABSTRACT\nAlthough our solar system features predominantly circular orbits, the exoplanets discovered so far indicate that this is the exception rather than the rule.\nThis could have crucial consequences for exoplanet climates, both because eccentric terrestrial exoplanets could have extreme seasonal variations, and because\ngiant planets on eccentric orbits could excite Milankovitch-like variations of a\npotentially habitable terrestrial planets eccentricity, on timescales of thousandsto-millions of years. A particularly interesting implication concerns the fact that\nthe Earth is thought to have gone through at least one globally frozen, \"snowball\" state in the last billion years that it presumably exited after several million\nyears of buildup of greenhouse gases when the ice-cover shut off the carbonatesilicate cycle. Water-rich extrasolar terrestrial planets with the capacity to host\nlife might be at risk of falling into similar snowball states. Here we show that if\na terrestrial planet has a giant companion on a sufficiently eccentric orbit, it can\nundergo Milankovitch-like oscillations of eccentricity of great enough magnitude\nto melt out of a snowball state.\n\nProceeding\nEven very mild astronomical forcings can have dramatic influence on the Earth's climate.\nAlthough the orbital eccentricity varies between \u223c0 and only \u223c0.06, and the axial tilt, or\nobliquity, between \u223c22.1\u25e6 and 24.5\u25e6 , these slight quasi-periodic changes are sufficient to help\ndrive the Earth into ice ages at regular intervals. Milankovitch articulated this possibility\nin his astronomical theory of climate change. Specifically, Milankovitch posited a causal\nconnection between three astronomical cycles (precession \u2013 23 kyr period, and variation of\nboth obliquity and eccentricity \u2013 41-kyr and 100-kyr periods, respectively) and the onset of\nglaciation/deglaciation. Though much remains to be discovered about these cycles, often in\nthe literature referred to as \"Milankovitch cycles,\"1 they are now generally acknowledged to\n1\n\nOr as \"Croll-Milankovitch cycles\" (1; 2).\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nhave been the dominant factor governing the climate changes of the last several million years\n(3; 4; 5; 6; 7).\nThe nonzero (but, at just 0.05, nearly zero) eccentricity of Jupiter's orbit is the primary\ndriver of the Earth's eccentricity Milankovitch cycle. Were Jupiter's eccentricity greater, it\nwould drive larger amplitude variations of the Earth's eccentricity. This same mechanism\nmight be operating in other solar systems. In the last 15 years, roughly \u223c500 extrasolar\nplanets have been discovered around other stars, where an object is here defined as a \"planet\"\nby the condition that it will not burn significant amounts of deuterium, which corresponds\napproximately to 13 Jupiter masses (8). (This might not be the best way to define exoplanets,\nbut it is probably the most widely used.). Among these \u223c500, there are many that have\nmasses comparable to Jupiter's and that are on highly eccentric orbits; \u223c20% of the known\nexoplanets have eccentricities greater than 0.4, including such extreme values as 0.93 and\n0.97 (HD 20782b; HD 80606). Furthermore, tantalizing evidence suggests that lower mass\nterrestrial planets might be even more numerous than the giant planets that are easier\nto detect. Therefore, it seems highly likely that many terrestrial planets in our galaxy\nexperience exaggerated versions of the Earth's eccentricity Milankovitch cycle.\nThese kinds of cycles could have dramatic influence on life that requires liquid water.\nSince the seminal work of Milankovitch several decades ago, a variety of theoretical investigations have examined the possible climatic habitability of terrestrial exoplanets. Kasting\nand collaborators emphasized that the habitability of an exoplanet depends on the properties\nof the host star (9). Several authors have considered how a planet's climatic habitability depends on the properties of the planet, as well. In particular, two recent papers have focused\non the climatic effect of orbital eccentricity. Williams & Pollard used a general circulation\nclimate model to address the question of how the Earth's climate would be affected by a\nmore eccentric orbit (10). Dressing et al. used an energy balance climate model (11) to\nexplore the combined influences of eccentricity and obliquity on the climates of terrestrial\nexoplanets with generic surface geography (see also (12) and (13; 14) for further description\nof the model). A more eccentric orbit both accentuates the difference between stellar irradiation at periastron and at apoastron, and increases the annually averaged irradiation. Thus,\nperiodic oscillations of eccentricity will cause concomitant oscillations of both the degree of\nseasonal extremes and of the total amount of starlight incident on the planet in each annual\ncycle. Since these oscillations depend on gravitational perturbations from other companion\nobjects, the present paper can be thought of as examining how a terrestrial planet's climatic\nhabitability depends not just on its star, not just on its own intrinsic properties, but also on\nthe properties of the planetary system in which it resides.\nThere is evidence that, at some point in the last billion years, Earth went through a\n\"Snowball Earth\" state in which it was fully (or almost fully) covered with snow and ice.\nThe high albedo of ice gives rise to a positive feedback loop in which decreasing surface\ntemperatures lead to greater ice-cover and therefore to further net cooling. As a result, the\nexistence of a low-temperature equilibrium climate might be a generic feature of water-rich\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nterrestrial planets, and such planets might have a tendency to enter snowball states. The icealbedo feedback makes it quite difficult for a planet to recover from such a state. In temperate\nconditions, the Earth's carbonate-silicate weathering cycle acts as a \"chemical thermostat\"\nthat tends to prevent surface temperatures from straying too far from the freezing point of\nwater. A snowball state would interrupt this cycle. The standard explanation of how the\nEarth might have exited its snowball state is that this interruption of the weathering cycle\nwould have allowed carbon dioxide to build up to concentrations approaching \u223c1 bar over a\nmillion-to-10-million years, at which point the greenhouse effect would have been sufficient\nto melt the ice-cover and restore temperate conditions.2\nHowever, an exoplanet in a snowball state that is undergoing a large excitation of its\neccentricity might be able to melt out of its globally frozen state in significantly less time,\ndepending on the magnitude of the eccentricity variations and on other properties of the\nplanet. Exploring this possibility is the primary focus of (17), in which, using an energy\nbalance climate model, we searched for orbital configurations that would lead to an icecovered planet melting out of the snowball state. In brief, we found that orbital configurations\nthat are not unlikely could cause a snowball-Earth-analog to melt out by dint of increased\neccentricity.\nFigure 1 shows the temperature evolution of two cold-start planet models, one of which (on\nthe right) has a crude approximation of a carbonate-silicate cycle incorporated in the infrared\ncooling term, and the other (on the left) does not. Both model planets have orbital semimajor\naxis 1 AU, and are initialized to very cold temperatures. The high orbital eccentricity of\nthese models (0.8) causes them to intercept more stellar irradiation over the annual cycle than\nwould a model on a circular orbit. They therefore heat rapidly and, with a crude accounting\nof the latent heat of melting/freezing water (17), are eventually able to melt through the ice\nlayer. Figure 2 shows two different compressed Milankovitch-like cycles. In each, a cycle that\nmight take 10,000 \u2013 400,000 years is compressed to 25 years, for computational feasibility\nand visualization purposes. In one (the top row), the planet is at semimajor axis 1 AU\nand has eccentricity varying sinusoidally between 0 and 0.83. In the other (bottom row),\nthe planet is at semimajor axis 0.8 AU and has eccentricity varying between 0.1 and 0.33.\nIn each case, after several years, a \"catastrophic event\" dramatically increases the albedo\nfor several years, so as to plunge the model planet into a snowball state. The increasing\neccentricity, then, eventually leads the planet to melt out of the snowball state. Finally, see\nFigures 3 and 4 of (17) for exemples of the magnitudes and frequencies of Milankovitch-like\neccentricity oscillations that can result from gravitational interactions between an eccentric\n2\n\nEven an ice-encrusted planet in the habitable zone will eventually melt, due to the post-main sequence\nred-giant evolution of a Sun-like star, as the star grows larger and brighter. The planet will not enjoy\ntemperate conditions for long, however, as the continued growth in size and luminosity of the giant will\neventually sterilize it of any water-based surface life. Whether the Earth will be engulfed by the Sun in its\ngiant phase (either by direct expansion or by tidal decay of its orbit), or will survive through the planetary\nnebula phase, remains an open question (15; 16).\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\ngiant planet and a terrestrial planet. Though these kinds of oscillations might be rare, they\nare not impossible. Entirely prosaic planetary system architectures can lead to less dramatic,\nbut still highly important, variations of a terrestrial planet's eccentricity.\nIn the coming years, as new observatories such as the James Webb Space Telescope come\nonline, exploring the atmospheres and atmospheric dynamics of exoplanets will become an\nincreasingly tractable research problem. Already, planets of the hot Jupiter class have been\namenable to investigation with the Spitzer Space Telescope, Kepler, and various groundbased observatories (see, e.g., (18; 19; 20; 21; 22; 23; 24), and more). It might even be\npossible to probe the atmospheric composition of even extremely distant exoplanets, in the\nGalactic bulge (25). Increasingly, it is possible to learn about the properties of Neptunemass exoplanets (26; 27; 28). Discerning the spectral signatures of habitability and of life\non terrestrial planets will be the next frontier (29). As the field of exoplanets matures, it\nwill be important to keep in mind that the long-term climatic habitability of a planet might\ndepend not just on the intrinsic properties of the host star and of the planet itself, but also\non the detailed architecture of the planetary system in which the planet resides.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe author would like to thank the contributions of Sean Raymond, Courtney Dressing, Caleb\nScharf, Kristen Menou, and Jonathan Mitchell.

Both models have\norbital eccentricity of 0.8 along with Earth-like 23.5\u25e6 polar obliquity and 1 bar surface pressure. Temperature is initialized to 100 K, and quickly rises to near 273 K. The melting\nof the ice-cover is handled in accordance with the prescription of (17). Left: CO2 partial\npressure is held constant at 0.01 bars. In this model, once the equatorial region melts, the\nregion of surface that has melted ice-cover grows steadily until the entire planet has melted,\nand temperatures eventually grow to more than 400 K over much of the planet (not shown).\nRight: CO2 partial pressure varies with temperature, in a crude simulation of a \"chemical\nthermostat\". In this model, the climate reaches a stable state with equatorial melt regions\nand polar ice-cover.\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\n\nTemperature (K)\n200\n\n210\n\n220\n\n230\n\n240\n\n250\n\n260\n\n270\n\n280\n\n290\n\nTemperature (K)\n300\n\n310\n\n320\n\n330\n\n340\n\n350\n\n200\n\nVariable Eccentricity Model at 1 AU, P[CO ] constant at 0.01 bars\n\nLatitude (degrees)\n\n\u221260\n\u221290\n0.9\nMaximum e: 0.83\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\nAlbedo spikes to 0.8 in this range\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25\n\n90\n\n210\n\n220\n\n230\n\n240\n\n250\n\nEccentricity\n\n\u03b8a: 30\u00b0\n\n60\n30\n\n\u03b8a: 30\n\n270\n\n280\n\n290\n\n260\n\n270\n\n280\n\n290\n\n300\n\n310\n\n320\n\n330\n\n300\n\n310\n\n320\n\n330\n\n340\n\n350\n\n2\n\n60\n30\n\n\u03b8p: 23.5\u00b0\n\u03b8a: 30\u00b0\n\n0\n\u221230\n\u221260\n\n\u221290\n0.9\nMaximum e: 0.83\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\nAlbedo spikes to 0.8 in this range\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25\n\nTime (years)\n340\n\n350\n\n200\n\n90\n\n\u00b0\n\n0\n\n\u221260\n\u221290\n\n210\n\n220\n\n230\n\n240\n\n250\n\n260\n\n270\n\n280\n\n290\n\n300\n\n310\n\n320\n\n330\n\n340\n\n350\n\nVariable Eccentricity Model at 0.8 AU, P[CO2] adjusts with T\n\n60\n\n\u03b8p: 23.5\u00b0\n\n30\n\n\u03b8a: 30\n\n\u00b0\n\n0\n\u221230\n\u221260\n\u221290\n\nMaximum e: 0.33; Minimum e: 0.10\nAlbedo spikes to 0.8 in this range\n\n0.4\nEccentricity\n\nEccentricity\n\n260\n\nTemperature (K)\n\n\u221230\n\n0.4\n\n250\n\nTime (years)\n\nVariable Eccentricity Model at 0.8 AU, P[CO2] constant at 0.01 bars\n\u03b8p: 23.5\u00b0\n\n240\n\nTemperature (K)\n\nLatitude (degrees)\n\nLatitude (degrees)\nEccentricity\n\n\u03b8p: 23.5\n\n\u221230\n\n200\n\nLatitude (degrees)\n\n\u00b0\n\n0\n\n230\n\n90\n\n60\n30\n\n220\n\nVariable Eccentricity Model at 1 AU, P[CO ] adjusts with T\n\n2\n\n90\n\n210\n\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n\nMaximum e: 0.33; Minimum e: 0.10\nAlbedo spikes to 0.8 in this range\n\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n\n0\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25\n\n0\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25\n\nTime (years)\n\nTime (years)\n\nFig. 2.- Compressed Milankovitch-like evolution of eccentricity and temperature at 1 AU\nand at 0.8 AU. Planets are initialized with warm equator and cold poles, similar to presentday Earth. In the top row (1 AU), the model planets are the same as in Fig. 1, except\nthe eccentricity varies sinusoidally between 0 and 0.83 with a 25-year period, to simulate\na time-acceleration (by a factor of \u223c102 to \u223c104 ) of a Milankovitch-like cycle. When the\neccentricity falls below 0.05, the planet's albedo spikes to 0.8, simulating a catastrophic event\nthat plunges the planet into a snowball state, with the latent heat prescription of (17). In\nthe bottom row (0.8 AU), the eccentricity varies between 0.1 and 0.33, also with a 25-year\nperiod. Left: CO2 partial pressure is held fixed at 0.01 bars. As in the left panel of Fig. 1,\nthese planets do not establish a temperate equilibrium. Right: CO2 partial pressure varies\nwith temperature. Here, temperature increases are muted by reduced greenhouse effect once\nthe ice-cover has melted somewhere.\n\n\f"}
