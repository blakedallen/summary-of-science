Introduction\nThe emission-line object MWC 623 was described by Allen\n& Swings (1976) as a peculiar Be star with a strong\nnear-infrared excess. The spectrum they discussed was\ndominated by strong emission lines of the Balmer series\nand numerous permitted and forbidden emission lines of\nFe ii, [Fe ii], and [O i]. Absorption lines were not reported.\nZickgraf & Stahl (1989) (hereafter referred to as Paper\nI) obtained high resolution spectroscopic observations of\nthis object. In addition to the rich emission line spectrum they detected early-type and late-type absorption\nfeatures, namely He i absorption lines and numerous absorption features of Fe i, Li i, Ca i, etc.. The analysis of\nthese spectroscopic properties and of the continuum energy distribution lead Zickgraf & Stahl to the conclusion\nthat MWC 623 is actually a binary system consisting of a\nB2- and K2-type component.\nPolarimetry of MWC 623 carried out by Zickgraf &\nSchulte-Ladbeck (1989) revealed the presence of intrinsic\npolarization. These observations were interpreted as being\ndue to a bipolar wind structure as suggested for B[e]-type\nstars e.g. by Zickgraf et al. (1985) (cf. also the review by\nZickgraf, 1998, on B[e]-type stars). The presence of intrinsic polarization was considered indicative for an inclination angle deviating significantly from pole-on.\nSend offprint requests to: F.-J. Zickgraf\n\nA puzzling discovery was the existence of a strong absorption line of lithium, Li i\u03bb6708\u00c5. Because it seemed unlikely that the late component in MWC 623 is a T Tauri\nstar Zickgraf & Stahl proposed that the high lithium abundance of the K star might be produced during He-flashes\noccuring when the K star evolves along the giant branch\nor alternatively that the object is just not old enough to\nhave the lithium completely depleted.\nIn this paper new spectroscopic observations of\nMWC 623 are presented. The purpose here is to investigate for the first time variability of the spectrum and to\nrediscuss the evolutionary scenario for MWC 623 based on\na revised spectral classification of the binary components.\nThe outline of the paper is as follows. The observations\nare described in Sect. 2. Radial velocity measurements are\ndiscussed in Sect. 3. In Sect. 4 spectroscopic variability\nis investigated. The stellar parameters and evolutionary\nstatus are discussed in Sect. 5. Finally, conclusions are\nsummarized in Sect. 6\n\n2. New spectroscopic observations\nMWC 623 was observed on October 21, 1998 and June\n16, 2000. The observations in 1998 were obtained with\nthe spectrograph AURELIE at the 1.5 m telescope of the\nObservatoire de Haute Provence. A description of the\nspectrograph can be found in Gillet et al. (1994). The spec-\n\n\f2\n\nF.-J. Zickgraf: The B[e]/K binary system MWC 623\n\ntra were observed with grating No. 2 with 1200 lines mm\u22121\ngiving a reciprocal linear dispersion of 8 \u00c5 mm\u22121 . The detector was a double-barrette Thomson TH7832 (2048 pixel\nwith 13 \u03bcm pixel size). The spectra cover the wavelength\ninterval from 6540 \u00c5 to 6740 \u00c5. The resolution of the spectra is 20 000. Wavelength calibration was obtained with\nNeon and Argon lamps.\nThe spectrum of June 2000 was observed with the\nechelle spectrograph FOCES (cf. Pfeiffer et al. 1998) at the\n2.2 m telescope of Calar Alto Observatory. The spectrograph was coupled to the telescope with the red fibre. The\ndetector was a 1024\u00d71024 pixel Tektronix CCD chip with\n24 \u03bcm pixel size. With a diaphragm diameter of 200 \u03bcm\nand an entrance slit width of 180 \u03bcm a spectral resolution of 34 000 was achieved. Wavelength calibration was\nobtained with a ThAr lamp.\nThe spectra were reduced with the standard routines\nof the ESO-MIDAS software package (contexts longslit for\nthe AURELIE spectra and echelle for the FOCES data).\n\n3. Radial velocities\n3.1. Absorption lines\nThe radial velocity of the late-type component was determined from the spectra by means of a cross-correlation\ntechnique, i.e. by measuring the shifts of the spectra relative to radial velocity standard stars. For this purpose\nfirst the mean continuum was subtracted from the normalized spectra. Then the spectra were rebinned on a\nlogarithmic wavelength scale. The relative shift was finally measured by cross-correlation. The standard stars\nused had been observed with AURELIE during the run\nin October 1998. The selected stars were HD 212943 (K0,\nvrad = 53.8 km s\u22121 ), HD186791 (K3, vrad = \u22122.1 km s\u22121 ),\nand HD 204867 (G0, vrad = +6.5 km s\u22121 ) (Duflot et al.\n1995). In order to obtain consistent measurements of the\nradial velocities also for the spectra of 1986-88 discussed\nin Paper I, the same procedure was applied also to these\ndata and the radial velocities were redetermined with the\nsame set of standard star spectra.\nThe section of the spectra used for the measurement\nwas 6600-6730\u00c5. This region is completely dominated by\nthe lines of the late-type component and is free of emission lines. For the spectrum of 1987 a smaller interval of\n6660-6710\u00c5 had to be used due the smaller wavelength\ninterval covered by the spectrogram of this observing run\n(cf. Paper I). Measurement errors were estimated from the\nscatter of the results for the three standard stars and from\nthe scatter of the individual spectra available for each observing campaign (2-3 spectra per observing run). Note,\nthat only minor differences in the redetermined velocities\nwere found relative to the results given in Paper I.\nThe velocities of the He i absorption lines (and of the\nemission lines, see below) were determined by measuring directly the wavelengths instead of using the crosscorrelation method.\n\nFig. 1. Heliocentric radial velocity of the K component.\nThe interval of \u03c3 = 2.6 km s\u22121 is marked by the upper\nand lower dashed lines.\nIn Table 1 the resulting heliocentric radial velocities\nare listed. The velocities measured from absorption lines\nof Fe i, Li i, and Ca i are summarized as \"K star abs.\".\nWithin the errors of the measurements no significant radial velocity variations of the absorption lines of the K star\ncould be detected between 1986 and 2000. This also holds\nfor the He i lines attributed to the B star component. In\nFig. 1 the heliocentric radial velocities of the K star are\nplotted for the different observational epochs. The mean\nvelocity of the K star calculated from the five measurements is vK = \u22120.8 \u00b1 2.6 km s\u22121 . The standard deviation\nof the mean velocity is of the same order as the individual\nerrors of the measurements.\n\n3.2. Emission lines\nThe radial velocities of the emission lines are also summarized in Table 1 including the results from Paper I. In\nconstrast to the absorption lines the emission features exhibit some variability. [O i] shows some variation on the\norder of 6 km s\u22121 . In 2000 the lines of Fe ii and [Fe ii] had\na slightly more negative velocity than in the 1980s. The\nmean difference is \u223c \u22126 km s\u22121 . Likewise, the Balmer lines\nin 1998 and 2000 exhibit a more negative velocity by the\nsame amount as the singly ionized iron lines. The variable velocities of the Balmer lines could be related to line\nprofile variations discussed in the next section.\n\n4. Spectroscopic variability\n4.1. Emission lines\nThe emission line of H\u03b1 is clearly variable. This is shown\nin Fig. 2. In the recent spectra the line is a factor two\nweaker than in the late 1980s. Also small changes in the\nline profile are discernible, in particular in the blue wing\nwhich showed a more pronounced dip in the 1998 and\n2000 spectra. The spectrum of 1998 additionally shows a\ndip also on the red wing (weakest line in Fig. 2).\n\n\fF.-J. Zickgraf: The B[e]/K binary system MWC 623\n\n3\n\nTable 1.

Rather, these lines seem\nto be constant in intensity, at least for the two epochs of\n1986 and 2000 (only these two observations of the blue\nspectral region are available). This is depicted in Fig. 3.\nNote, that the spectrum of 2000 has been rebinned to the\nsame resolution as that of 1986 for this comparison.\n\ndate\n\nLi i\n\u03bb6708\n\nCa i\n\u03bb6719\n\nFe i\n\u03bb6703\n\nFe i\n\u03bb6705\n\nFe i\n\u03bb6710\n\n\u03a3 Fe i\n\n1986\n1987\n1988\n1998\n2000\n\n192\n200\n298\n135\n200\n\n123\n140\n142\n91\n137\n\n68\n74\n67\n61\n81\n\n60\n36\n62\n20\n53\n\n95\n100\n88\n44\n82\n\n223\n210\n217\n125\n216\n\n4.2. Absorption lines\nIn Fig. 4 a section of the spectrum of MWC 623 around the\nline of Li i\u03bb6708\u00c5 are shown for the five epochs of observation. Obviously, the strengths of the K star absorption\nfeatures are variable to some extent. The measured equivalent widths W of some characteristic lines of Fe i, of Li i,\nand of Ca i are listed in Table 2. In addition, the sum of\nthe three Fe i lines is listed, which has a smaller relative\nerror than the individual lines.\nComparing the measured equivalent width in the different years which are plotted in Fig. 5 one realizes a significant weakening of the strength of all lines in 1998 while\nin the other years the line strengths are similar except the\nline of Li i which shows a significant maximum in 1988.\nThe comparison of the relative line strength, i.e.\nW (Li i)/W (Ca i), W (Li i)/W (\u03a3 Fe i), and W (Ca i)/W (\u03a3\nFe i), however, does not reveal the drop in 1998. This is\ndepicted in Fig. 6. Rather, the line ratios are constant\nwithin the errors. However, the Li i line again deviates\nsignificantly in 1988 in the sense of being stronger than in\nthe other years.\nAn explanation for the variation of the measured\nequivalent widths in 1998 could be a varying relative\nbrightness of the B and the K star. This would change\nthe relative continuum level and consequently the equivalent widths of intrinsically constant lines. The weakening\nof the K star absorption lines in 1998 would thus correspond either to a fading of the K star or to a brightening of\nthe B star. Bergner et al. (1995) published U BV RIJHK\nphotometry for MWC 623 obtained in 1989-1994. Their\n\n\f4\n\nF.-J. Zickgraf: The B[e]/K binary system MWC 623\n\nFig. 5.

The dashed line mark the positions of\nLi i\u03bb6708\u00c5 and Ca i\u03bb6717\u00c5.\n\nmean V magnitude was 10.89 \u00b1 0.06 as compared to 10.5\nmeasured by Allen & Swings (1976). This shows that\nMWC 623 which is also known as V2028 Cyg is photometrically variable at least on a 0.3-0.4 magnitude level\nin V . The mean B \u2212 V colour of Bergner et al. is\n+1.21 \u00b1 0.05 which is similar to +1.3 given by Swings\n(1981). Unfortunately, the photometry available so far\ndoes not allow to decide which of the components is variable although there might be some weak indication that\nthe object appears bluer when it is weaker. This would\nsuggest that the K star became fainter.\nThe behaviour of the Li i line remains puzzling.\nWhereas the ratio of Ca i and Fe i is constant suggesting\nthat no change of the effective temperature of the K star\nhas occured, the observation of 1988 seems to indicate a\nreal increase of the Li i equivalent width although no explanation for such a behaviour can be give at this time.\nCertainly, further monitoring of the spectrum is necessary\nin order to investigate this phenomenon in more detail.\n\n5. Discussion\n\nFig. 6. Ratio of the equivalent widths listed in Table 2.\nWhereas the ratio of Ca i and Fe i is constant, even in\n1998, a significant variation of the Li i line is discernible\nin 1988 relative to both, Ca i and Fe i.\n\n5.1. Distance towards MWC 623 and stellar parameters\nAs discussed in Paper I the continuum energy distribution\ncan be well fitted with the superposition of the energy flux\ndistribution of a B star, a K star, and a black body with\nTbb \u2248 930 K, assuming a reddening of EB\u2212V = 0.8 \u00b1\n0.2. The spectral types adopted for the fit were B2V and\nK2III. The relative brightness of the components lead to\ndereddened V magnitudes of V0 = 8.6 and 9 for the K\nand the B star, respectively. The uncertainty of V0 due to\nEB\u2212V is of the order of 0.6 mag.\nIn the following a new estimate of the spectral types\nof the components is obtained by making use of the wider\nspectral coverage provided by the FOCES echelle spectrum compared to the short spectral sections observed\nwith the coud\u00e9 spectrograph in 1986-1988.\n\n\fF.-J. Zickgraf: The B[e]/K binary system MWC 623\n\n5\n\nFig. 8. Spectrum of MWC 623 together with spectra of\nstars with spectral types between B2 and B6. Note, that\nin MWC 623 Mg ii\u03bb4481 is in emission. The B star spectra were obtained from the stellar library of Prugniel &\nSoubiran (2001).\n\nFig. 7. Spectrum of MWC 623 together with spectra of\nstars with spectral types between K0Iab and K5Ib (upper\npanel) and between K2III and K2Ib (lower panel). The\nH\u03b1 emission line of MWC 623 has been removed by normalization. The comparison shows good agreement of the\nK component of MWC 623 with the K2II and K2Ib star. A\nspectral type of K2II-Ib is therefore adopted for MWC 623.\nThe K star spectra were obtained from the HYPERCAT\ndata base of Prugniel & Soubiran (2001).\n\n5.1.1. Spectral types of the binary components\nThe late-type component of MWC 623 was re-classified\nby comparison with high resolution spectra of late G to\nK stars retrieved from the stellar library of Prugniel &\nSoubiran (2001). This library is part of the HYPERCAT1\ndata base. Note that the resolution of the spectra in\nHYPERCAT is similar to that of the FOCES spectra.\nThe comparison with stars of spectral types between\nG8 and K5 and of luminosity classes V to I yields the\nbest agreement for spectral type K2II-Ib, which will be\nadopted in the following. The uncertainty of the spectral\ntype is about 1-2 subclasses. Luminosity class V can be\ndefinitely excluded. Likewise, luminosity class III yields a\n1\n\nURL: http://www-www-obs.univlyon1.fr/hypercat/11/\nspectrophotometry.html\n\nsignificantly poorer agreement than the higher luminosity\nspectra. Fig. 7 depicts the comparison of the late component of MWC 623 with various K stars and with K2 stars\nof luminosity class III, II, and Ib (HD 5234, HD 39400, and\nHD 206778, respectively).\nLikewise, the reclassification of the early-type component of MWC 623 was aided by the comparison with\nB type spectra from the stellar library of Prugniel &\nSoubiran. The classification of the late component suggests a luminosity class III for the hot component (see\nbelow). A section around He i\u03bb4388 and He i\u03bb4471 of the\nspectra is shown in Fig. 8. The spectral type of the B component can be confined between B2 and B6 from the relative strengths of the He i lines, by taking into account that\nthe lines of Si iii\u03bb\u03bb4553, 4568, 4575 are absent, and from\nthe ratio of the very weak absorption feature at \u03bb4075 and\nof CII\u03bb4267. In the following a spectral type of B4 will be\nadopted with an uncertainty of 2 subclasses. This is somewhat later than adopted in Paper I, however, with only\nweak effects on the continuum fit as carried out in Paper I.\nIn particular, the intrinsic colours are not much different\nand therefore the conclusions on the relative fluxes of the\ncomponents and the dereddened magnitudes from Paper\nI are adopted also here in the following.\nTo summarize the result of the spectral classification\nit can be stated that the spectral types of the two components are K2II-Ib and B4.\n\n5.1.2. Kinematic distance estimate\nAs discussed in Paper I the projected position of MWC 623\nin the plane of sky at l = 67.\u25e6 64 and b = 1.\u25e6 26 lies between\nthe Vul OB1, OB4 (l \u2248 60\u25e6 ) and the Cyg OB3 A, B and\nOB1 associations (l \u2248 73\u25e6 and 76\u25e6 , respectively). The distances of these associations are d = 1.21, 2.54, 1.37, 1.82,\nand 2.31 kpc respectively. The association data were taken\n\n\f6\n\nF.-J. Zickgraf: The B[e]/K binary system MWC 623\n\nFig. 9. Position of MWC 623 in the sky (\u22c6 symbol) in\ngalactic coordinates and the locations of the (projected)\nnearby associations Vul OB4, OB1, Cyg OB3 A, B, and\nCyg OB1.\nfrom Melnik & Efremov (1995) who in addition to the location also give the approximate extension of the associations. In Fig. 9 the position of MWC 623 in galactic coordinates and the associations located in the immediate (projected) neighborhood are plotted. MWC 623 obviously is\ntoo far from each of these associations to be considered\nas a member of one of them. Rather, MWC 623 seems to\nbe located somewhere in the field. Melnik & Efremov also\ngive radial velocities for some associations, e.g. for Cyg\nOB3A, B, and OB1 \u22129, \u221217, and \u22126.5 km s\u22121 , respectively, however, with considerable scatter of 7-10 km s\u22121\nrendering a comparison with MWC 623 meaningless.\nAn independent estimate for the distance may be obtained from the galactic rotation curve if it is assumed that\nthe star is comoving with the field at its given location in\nthe Milky Way.\nWith a second order expansion of the galactic rotation\ncurve the velocity of MWC 623 in the local standard of\nrest (LSR) frame, vLSR , is given by\nvLSR = \u22122 A \u2206R sin l cos b \u2212 2 A2 (\u2206R)2 sin l cos b\n\n(1)\n\nwhere\nvLSR = vhelio + v\u2299\n\n(2)\n\nand \u2206R = R \u2212 R0 , with R and R0 = 8.5 kpc being the\ngalacto-centric distances of the star and the sun, repectively, l and b the galactic longitudes and latitude, respectively, and the constants A = 16.1 km s\u22121 kpc\u22121 and\nA2 = \u22120.7 km s\u22121 kpc\u22122 (cf. Dubath et al. 1988). The solar motion is given by\nv\u2299 = 19.5 km s\u22121 (cos \u03b1\u2299 cos \u03b4\u2299 cos \u03b1 cos \u03b4 +\nsin \u03b1\u2299 cos \u03b4\u2299 sin \u03b1 cos \u03b4 + sin \u03b4\u2299 sin \u03b4)\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03b1 and \u03b4 are the right ascension and declination of\nthe star, and \u03b1\u2299 (1900) = 18h and \u03b4\u2299 (1900) = +30\u25e6 are\nthe standard solar apex (Lang 1980).\n\nThe systemic velocity of MWC 623 should, of course,\nbe derived from the velocity of the centre-of-gravity of\nthe binary system. However, the orbital parameters of the\nsystem are still unknown. Therefore, as an estimate for\nthe centre-of-mass velocity the mean of the velocities of\nthe photospheric lines of the B and the K star in 1986\nand 2000 was used, i.e. vhelio = \u22121.3 \u00b1 2 km s\u22121 . Note\nthat the mass estimates obtained below yielding a mass\nratio of close to 1 justifies this approximation. In this\nway vLSR \u2248 +16.7 km s\u22121 with v\u2299 = +18 km s\u22121 , and\n\u2206R = \u22120.55 kpc is obtained from equ. 1. At the given\ngalactic longitude two solutions for the distance exist,\n+0.4\nd1 = 2.0+0.6\n\u22120.3 kpc and d2 = 4.4\u22120.5 kpc. The uncertainties\ngiven here result from the statistical error of the adopted\nradial velocity of 2 km s\u22121 only. No systematic errors like\npeculiar velocity were taken into account. The distances\ncorrespond to distance moduli of m \u2212 M = 11.5+0.5\n\u22120.4 , and\nm \u2212 M = 13.2+0.2\n,\nrespectively.\nNote\nthat\nboth\ndistances\n\u22120.3\nare consistent with the extinction AV \u2248 1.9 \u2212 3.1 which\nin the direction towards MC 623 occurs at distances larger\nthan 2-3 kpc ( Neckel & Klare 1980).\n\n5.1.3. Distance and stellar parameters\nThe spectral classification of the late component yielded\na spectral type of K2II-Ib which leads to an absolute visual magnitude of MV = \u22123.3 \u00b1 1 (Schmidt-Kaler 1982).\nWith the dereddened V magnitude derived in Paper I of\nV0 = 8.6 this yields m \u2212 M = 11.9 \u00b1 1 or d = 2.4+1.4\n\u22120.9 kpc.\nNote the good agreement with the short kinematic distance d1 . The long kinematic distance of 4.4 kpc corresponds to MV = \u22124.6+0.2\n\u22120.3 for the K star which would still\nmarginally be consistent with the spectroscopic distance,\nalthough the overall agreement of spectroscopic and kinematic distance is better for the short distance. Therefore\nin the following the spectroscopic distance of 2.4 kpc is\nadopted. The dereddened visual brightness of the earlytype component of V0 = 9 then leads to luminosity class\nIII for the B star, i.e. a spectral type B4III. The stellar\nparameters of the components of MWC 623 derived for\nd = 2.4 kpc are summarized in Table 3. Bolometric corrections were taken from Schmidt-Kaler (1982).\nIn Fig. 10 the location of the components of MWC 623\non the H-R diagram are shown. Evolutionary tracks were\ntaken from Schaller et al. (1992) for metallicity Z = 0.020.\nThe masses estimated from the tracks are 6-9 M\u2299 and 510 M\u2299 for the B and the K star, respectively (see Table\n3). The resulting mass ratio is MK /MB = 1.07 \u00b1 0.4.\n\n5.2. Evolutionary status\nA possible model for MWC 623 could involve interaction\nin a close binary system. However, this was already rejected in Paper I based on observations covering about 2\nyears. The absence of significant radial velocity variations\nof the photospheric absorption lines of the B and the K\nstar on an even longer timescale of 14 years as discussed\n\n\fF.-J.

Because the polarization is proportional to sin2 i the inclination should be intermediate to large, i.e. i should be of the order of >\n\u223c3045\u25e6 . Otherwise, the observed degree of intrinsic polarization, pobs = ptrue sin2 i of about 2% (Zickgraf & SchulteLadbeck 1989) would lead to unreasonably high true polarization ptrue .\nAssuming a minimum separation of the components\non the order of the radius of the K star, i.e.100 R\u2299 , the\nmasses determined above would lead to a period of \u223c 30\ndays from\nFig. 10.

(1994) for metallicity Z = 0.020 with the positions of the B and the K\ncomponent of MWC 623. Ages are indicated for each track.\n\nin Sect. 3 indicates that the orbital period is actually on\nthe order of longer than 14 years unless the small radial\nvelocity variation is due to a low inclination angle. This\nseems, however, to be inconsistent with the observed polarization. Rather, the inclination angle is expected to be\nintermediate to large.\n\nP =\n\na3/2\nyr\nM 1/2\n\n(4)\n\nwith the separation a (in A.U.) and the total mass M =\nM1 + M2 (in M\u2299 ) of the system. In this case the velocity amplitude would be of the order of 80 km s\u22121 . This\nis inconsistent with the observations because even within\na few days of observation as in 1988 (cf. Paper I) significant velocity variations should have been detectable.\nOn the other hand, the small observed velocity variation\n\u22121\n\u2206v sin i <\n\u223c 2\u22123 km s over a time interval of 14 years suggests that the orbital period P is longer than \u223c 14 years.\nThis leads to a >\n\u223c 14A.U. \u2248 3000R\u2299. The velocity ampli\u22121\ntude would then be of the order of <\n\u223c 15km s . Taking\nsin i into account expected velocity variations are thus on\nthe order of at most a few km s\u22121 , which is consistent with\nthe observations.\nThe linear separation of the components of 14 A.U.\ncorresponds to an angular separation of \u223c 5 mas. By taking into account the different colours of the components\na positional shift should be directly measurable with the\nforthcoming astrometric space missions DIVA and GAIA\nby comparing observations in different colours.\nThese estimates suggest that MWC 623 is a wide binary system. In this case each component evolved like a\nsingle star. From the evolutionary timescales for single\nstars it is expected that the B star is less massive than the\nK star which then would evolve faster. This is in agreement\nwith the mass estimates given above. Figure 11 shows the\nH-R diagram with isochrones from Bertelli et al. (1994)\nfor metallicity Z = 0.020. The positions of the B and K\ncomponent confirm that both are coeval within the error\nbars. Both stars lie on the 50 Myr isochrone within an uncertainty range from \u223c 30 to \u223c 125 Myr for the K star\n\n\f8\n\nF.-J. Zickgraf: The B[e]/K binary system MWC 623\n\nand \u223c 30 to \u223c 60 Myr for the B star. The B component\nthus constraints the age to 50+10\n\u221220 Myr.\nThese findings shed new light on the question of origin\nof the strong lithium line in MWC 623 which, in principle,\ncould indicate a pre-main sequence status for the K star.\nHowever, the spectroscopic characteristics exclude a lowluminosity K star and lead instead to a luminosity which\nis more than 2 orders of magnitudes above the stellar birth\nline (cf. Palla & Stahler 1993) which for Teff = 4300 K is\nlocated at log L/L\u2299 \u2248 +1. The K star is therefore clearly\nin a post-main sequence evolutionary phase.\nThe estimated age of 50 Myr is younger than that of\nthe Pleiades (80-100 Myr). The lithium abundance of the\nlate-type stars in this cluster is still high due to the young\nage. The high lithium abundance of the late component\nof MWC 623 can therefore quite naturally be explained by\nthe age in the sense that the primordial lithium is not yet\ndestroyed.\nThe B[e] star in MWC 623 is located slightly off but\nstill close to the main sequence and could thus be related\nto the class of (near) main-sequence B[e]-type stars discussed by Lamers et al. (1998) and Zickgraf (1998) for\nwhich HD 45677 and HD 50138 are examples. For this type\nof B[e] star it is unclear whether they are still in a pre-main\nsequence phase of evolution or if they are already in the\ncore-hydrogen burning phase. The first possiblity would\nplace them on contraction tracks of Herbig Ae/Be stars\ntowards the main-sequence instead of post-ZAMS evolutionary tracks. For MWC 623 is was possible for the first\ntime to obtain a reliable age estimate. It clearly excludes\nthe pre-main sequence option at least for this object. Note\nalso that both components of MWC 623 are located above\nthe stellar birth line (cf. Fig. 10). This is also inconstent\nwith a pre-main sequence status. The conclusion is that\nthe B[e] component in MWC 623 is a slightly evolved object starting its post-main sequence evolution. The similarities with the mentioned (near) main-sequence B[e]type stars suggest that this conclusion might also hold for\nthe latter class.\nThe B[e] component in MWC 623 might even belong to\nthe subgroup of post-main sequence B[e] stars discovered\nin the Magellanic Clouds at luminosities log L/L\u2299 \u2248 4\n(Gummersbach et al. 1995). These objects are located in\nthe H-R diagram below the luminous B[e] supergiants described by Zickgraf et al. (1986) and extend the class of\nB[e] supergiants towards lower luminosities into the range\nof classical Be stars.\n\n6. Conclusions\nNew spectroscopic observations were used to reinvestigate\nthe B[e]/K binary system MWC 623. Neither the K nor the\nB star absorption lines were found to exhibit significant\nradial velocity variations over a time interval of 14 years\nsuggesting that the orbital period is longer than 14 years.\nThe spectral classification using a recent echelle spectrum yielded spectral types of K2II-Ib and B4III. The\nluminosity class of the K star was used to estimate the\n\ndistance towards MWC 623 to 2.4 kpc which is consistent\nwith the kinematic distance of 2.0 kpc.\nPlacing the binary components in the H-R diagram\nallows to derive masses of 7 and 7.5 M\u2299 for the B and K\nstar, respectively, yielding a mass ratio close to 1. Both\nstars are coeval with an age of 50 Myr as shown by the\ncomparison with isochrones.\nThe high luminosity of the K star excludes a pre-main\nsequence evolutionary phase as explanation for the strong\nLi i\u03bb6708 absorption line. Rather, the high lithium abundance is a consequence of the young age. Likewise, a premain sequence Herbig Ae/Be phase of the B[e] star can\nbe excluded. Instead it is a slightly evolved post-main sequence object.\nIn order to determine the orbital parameters of\nMWC 623 and to investigate in more detail the variablility indicated by the presently available observations it is\nclearly desirable to monitor this object spectroscopically\nand photometrically also in the future.\nAcknowledgements.
