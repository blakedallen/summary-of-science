An ab-initio calculation of the inelastic neutral reaction of neutrino on 4 He is presented\n[1], including realistic nuclear force and full final state interaction among the four nucleons. The\ncalculation uses the powerful combintation of the Lorentz integral transform (LIT) method and the\nhyperspherical-harmonic effective interaction approach (EIHH). The neutrino - nucleus interaction\nis taken in the impulse approximation. With respect to previous calculations [2], [3], the current\nwork predicts an increased reaction cross-section by 10% \u2212 30% for neutrino temperature up to 15\nMeV.\n\nNeutrino reactions with nuclear targets have an important part in many physical\nphenomena. In astrophysics, for example, neutrino-nuclei interactions have a main role\nin supernova explosion and the nucleosynthesis of the elements. The neutral inelastic\nreactions of 4 He with \u03bdx (\u03bdx ) (x = e, \u03bc , \u03c4 ) have a part in these two phenomena. Core\ncollapse supernovae are widely accepted to be a neutrino driven explosion of a massive\nstar. When the iron core of a massive star becomes gravitationally unstable it collapses\nuntil short-range nuclear forces halt the collapse and drive an outgoing shock through the\nouter layers of the core and the inner envelope. However, the shock loses energy through\ndissociation of iron nuclei and neutrino radiation, and gradually stalls, it becomes an\naccretion shock. It is believed, but to date not proven, that the shock is then revived as\nneutrinos emitted from the collapsed core (the proto-neutron star) deposit energy in the\nmatter behind the shock to reverse the flow to an outgoing shock which explodes the\nstar. Hydrodynamic simulations fail in reviving the shock [4], [5]. One of the ways to\nsolve this problem is through enhancing the neutrinos-matter coupling.\nThe matter behind the shock is composed mainly of protons, neutrons, electrons, and\n4 He nuclei. In contrast to the fairly known cross-sections of neutrinos with electrons\nand nucleons, the interaction of neutrinos with 4 He is not accurately known. The current\nwork is the first realistic microscopic calculation of this cross-section.\nIn their way to the stalled shock, the electron-neutrinos remain in equilibrium with\nmatter for a longer period than their heavy-flavor counterparts, due to the larger cross\nsections for scattering of electrons and because of charge current reactions. Thus the\nheavy-flavor neutrinos decouple from deeper within the star, where temperatures are\nhigher. Typical calculations yield temperatures of \u223c 10MeV for \u03bc - and \u03c4 - neutrinos [6],\nwhich is approximately twice the temperature of electron-neutrinos. Consequently, there\nis a considerable amount of \u03bd\u03bc ,\u03c4 with energies above 20 MeV that can dissociate the 4 He\nthrough neutral reaction.\nTheoretical understanding of neutrino-nucleus scattering process is achieved through\n\n\fTABLE 1.

In the limit of small momentum\ntransfer (compared to the Z particle rest mass),\nthe effective Hamiltonian can be written\nR\nas a current-current interaction: \u0124W = \u221aG d 3 x j\u03bc (~x)J \u03bc (~x), where G is the Fermi weak\n2\ncoupling constant, j\u03bc (~x) is the leptonic current, and J \u03bc is the hadronic current. The\nmatrix element of the leptonic current is h f | j\u03bc |ii = l\u03bc e\u2212i~q*~x , where ~q is the momentum\ntransfer and l\u03bc = \u016b(k\u03bd \u2032 )\u03b3\u03bc (1 \u2212 \u03b35 )u(k\u03bd ).\nThe nuclear current matrix elements consists of one body weak currents, but also\nmany body corrections due to meson exchange. The many-body currents are a result\nof meson exchange between the nucleons. The current work is done in the impulse\napproximation, thus taking into account only one-body terms. In order to estimate this\napproximation, we refer to studies of inclusive electron scattering off 4 He [7], where it is\nshown that isovector electromagnetic two-body currents, which are proportional to the\nelectroweak vector currents, produce a strong enhancement of the transverse response\nat low and intermediate energies. In the current calculation, the vector part is almost\nnegligible with respect to the axial part, and the two-body axial currents are expected to\ngive small contributions [8]. The one-body currents connect the 4 He ground state and\nfinal state wave functions. In order to calculate the cross-section in a percentage level\naccuracy, one needs a solid estimate of these wave functions.\nThe differential cross-section is given by Fermi's golden rule, and is proportional to\nthe response functions of the Coulomb, longitudinal, transverse electric and transverse\nmagnetic multipole operators. The response functions are calculated by combining two\npowerful tools: the Lorentz integral transform (LIT) method [9] and the effective interaction hyperspherical harmonics (EIHH) method [10]. First we use the LIT method in\norder to convert the scattering problem into a bound state like problem, and then the\nEIHH method is used to solve the resulting equations. Using this procedure we solve\nthe final state interaction problem avoiding continuum wave functions. The combination\nof the EIHH and LIT methods brings to a rapid convergence in the response functions\nwhen increasing the effective interaction model space.\nIn Table 1 we present the calculated total temperature averaged cross-section, h\u03c3 iT =\n\n\f11\n2 A h\u03c3\u03bd\n\n+ \u03c3\u03bd iT , and energy transfer cross-section, h\u03c3 \u03c9 iT = 21 A1 h\u03c9\u03c3\u03bd + \u03c9\u03c3\u03bd iT , as a\nfunction of the neutrinos' temperature. Also presented are earlier results by Woosley et.\nal. [2]. It can be seen that the current work predicts an enhancement of about 10% \u221230%\nin the cross-section.\nThe energy transfer cross-section was fitted by Haxton to the formula [3],\nh\u03c3 \u03c9 iT = \u03b1\n\n\u0012\n\nT \u2212 T0\n10MeV\n\n\u0013\u03b2\n\n(1)\n\nwith the parameters \u03b1 = 0.62 * 10\u221240cm2 MeV, T0 = 2.54MeV, \u03b2 = 3.82. A similar fit\nto our results yields \u03b1 = 0.64 * 10\u221240cm2 MeV, T0 = 2.05MeV, \u03b2 = 4.46. It can be seen\nthat the current work predicts a stronger temperature dependence of the cross sections.\nFor example, a 15% differnce between these calculations at T = 10 Mev, grows to a 50%\ndifference at T = 16 MeV.\nIn conclusion, a detailed realistic calculation of the inelastic neutrino-4 He neutral\nscattering cross-section is given. The calculation was done in the impulse approximation\nwith numerical accuracy of about 1%. The different approximations used here should\nresult in about 10% error, mainly due to many-body currents, which were not considered\nin the current work.\nThe effect of these results on the supernova explosion mechanism should be checked\nthrough hydrodynamic simulations, of various progenitors. Nonetheless, it is clear that\nour results facilitate a stronger neutrino-matter coupling in the supernova environment.\nFirst, our calculations predict an enhanced cross section by 10% \u2212 30% with respect\nto previous estimates. Second, we obtained steeper dependence of the energy transfer\ncross-section on the neutrino's temperature. Thus, supporting the observation that the\ncore temperature is a critical parameter in the explosion process. It is important to notice\nthat the energy-transfer due to inelastic reactions are 1 \u2212 2 orders of magnitude larger\nthan the elastic reactions, ergo the inelastic cross-section are important to an accurate\ndescription of the Helium shell temperature.\nThe Authors would like thank W.
