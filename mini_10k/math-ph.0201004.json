Introduction\nThe Jacobi elliptic functions sn (x, m), cn (x, m) and dn (x, m) with real elliptic modulus parameter\nm (0 \u2264 m \u2264 1) have been extensively studied and used in mathematics, science and engineering [1, 4].\nRecently, while studying [7, 8] the properties of quantum mechanical periodic potentials [2, 10], we\nhave discovered numerous mathematical identities involving Jacobi elliptic functions. The purpose of\nthis paper is to tabulate, derive and discuss these identities.\nTo the best of our knowledge, our results are not discussed in the mathematics literature. However,\nwe did find that geometrical constructions called the \"poristic polygons of Poncelet\" give rise to a few\nof our very simplest identities like eqs. (3) and (32) involving just the Jacobi elliptic functions dn(x, m).\nFor a discussion of this geometrical approach, see references [5, 6].\nOur new identities play a crucial role in obtaining a large class of novel periodic solutions of the\nKorteweg-de Vries (KdV) and modified Korteweg-de Vries equations [9], the nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger\nand KP equations, the sine-Gordon equation, as well as the \u03bb\u03c64 model [3]. The solutions obtained for\nthe KdV equation [9] all correspond to one gap periodic potentials. This process can be generalized\nto obtain new solvable periodic potentials with a finite number of band gaps [8].\nIf K(m) denotes the complete elliptic integral of the first kind, the elliptic functions sn (x, m) and\ncn (x, m) have real periods 4K(m), whereas dn (x, m) has a period 2K(m). The m = 0 limit gives\nK(0) = \u03c0/2 and trigonometric functions: sn(x, 0) = sin x, cn(x, 0) = cos x, dn(x, 0) = 1. The m \u2192 1\nlimit gives K(1) \u2192 \u221e and hyperbolic functions: sn(x, 1) \u2192 tanh x, cn(x, 1) \u2192 sech x, dn(x, 1) \u2192\nsech x. Therefore, our new identities for Jacobi elliptic functions can be thought of as generalizations\nto arbitrary m of identities involving trigonometric and hyperbolic functions.\n2. Description of the identities\nIn all the identities discussed in this paper, the arguments of the Jacobi functions are separated by\neither 2K(m)/p or 4K(m)/p, where p is an integer (p \u2265 2) depending on whether the left hand side\nof the identity is a periodic function of period 2K(m)/p or 4K(m)/p. For any given choice of p, we\ndefine the quantities si , ci and di as follows:\nsi \u2261 sn[x +\n\n2(i \u2212 1)K(m)\n2(i \u2212 1)K(m)\n2(i \u2212 1)K(m)\n, m] , ci \u2261 cn[x +\n, m] , di \u2261 dn[x +\n, m] . (1)\np\np\np\n\n2\n\n\fSimilarly, we define\ns\u0303i \u2261 sn[x +\n\n4(i \u2212 1)K(m)\n4(i \u2212 1)K(m)\n4(i \u2212 1)K(m)\n, m] ; c\u0303i \u2261 cn[x +\n, m] , d \u0303i \u2261 dn[x +\n, m] . (2)\np\np\np\n\nEach p-point identity which we discuss will involve a cyclic homogeneous polynomial of degree r\n(in Jacobi elliptic functions with p equally spaced arguments) expressed as a linear combination of\nother cyclic homogeneous polynomials of degree r \u2212 2n, where 1 \u2264 n \u2264 2r . We designate this to be a\np-point identity of rank r.\nLet us consider a few examples to clarify the terminology and establish the notation. A simple\n4-point identity of rank 2 is\nd1 d2 + c.p. \u2261 d1 d2 + d2 d3 + d3 d4 + d4 d1 = A ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere we have used the notation \"+ c.p.\" to denote cyclic permutations of the indices 1, 2, . . . , p.\nLater, we have also used the notation \"\u2212 c.p.\" to denote cyclic permutations with alternating positive\nand negative signs. The quantities in eq. (3) are\nd1 \u2261 dn(x, m) , d2 \u2261 dn(x + K(m)/2, m) , d3 \u2261 dn(x + K(m), m) , d4 \u2261 dn(x + 3K(m)/2, m) . (4)\nSetting x = 0, the constant A can be computed to be A = 2t(1 + t2 ) where\nt \u2261 dn(K(m)/2, m) = (1 \u2212 m)1/4 .\n\n(5)\n\nSimilarly, two examples of 3-point identities of rank 2 and rank 3 are\nc\u03031 c\u03032 + c.p. = \u2212\n\nq(q + 2)\n, c\u03031 d \u03032 d \u03033 + c.p. = \u2212q 2 (c\u03031 + c\u03032 + c\u03033 ) ,\n(1 + q)2\n\n(6)\n\nwhere\nq \u2261 dn(2K(m)/3, m) ,\n\n(7)\n\nand the arguments are x, x + 4K(m)/3 and x + 8K(m)/3 respectively. Many more examples are given\nin Tables 1, 2 and 3. Identities of rank 2 are given in Table 1, identities of rank 3 are given in Table\n2 and some examples of identities of rank 4 or greater are displayed in Table 3.\nAlthough x-independent constants like A do depend on the number of points p, the rank r, the\nmodulus parameter m, and the specific identity involved, for simplicity, we do not usually exhibit\nthese dependences explicitly. In fact, the symbols A, B and C appearing in the identities given in\nTables 1, 2 and 3 are just meant to denote generic constants. They do not all have the same values.\n3\n\n\fFor illustrative purposes, we now outline the proof of the p-point identity\nd1 d2 + c.p. = A ,\n\n(8)\n\nwhich is true for any integer value p > 1. The left hand side of this identity contains p terms. The\n\u221a\nproof for p = 2 is trivial, since it is well-known that d1 d2 \u2261 dn(x, m) dn(x + K(m), m) = 1 \u2212 m\n[1, 4]. For p = 3, one needs to compute d1 d2 + d2 d3 + d3 d1 \u2261 dn(x, m) dn(x + 2K(m)/3, m) + dn(x +\n2K(m)/3, m) dn(x + 4K(m)/3, m) + dn(x + 4K(m)/3, m) dn(x, m). This can be accomplished by\nalgebraic simplification after using the addition theorem [1, 4]\ndn(u + v) = (dnu dnv \u2212 m snu cnu snv cnv)/(1 \u2212 m sn2 u sn2 v) .\n\n(9)\n\nThe result is the constant A for the p = 3 case. One gets A = q(q + 2), where q has been defined in\neq. (7).\nSimilarly, the result for p = 4 has already been discussed following eq. (3). In principle, an analogous algebraic procedure can be used for any value of p, but the algebra becomes increasingly lengthier.\nWe have therefore verified identity (8) numerically using the advanced mathematical software package\nMaple. Note that for any chosen value of p, the constant A equals p in the limit m = 0 and vanishes\nfor m \u2192 1.\nGiven any p-point identity of rank r, one way of generating a new p-point identity of rank r + 1 is\nby differentiation and use of the well-known formulas\nd\nd\nsn(x, m) = cn(x, m) dn(x, m) ,\ncn(x, m) = \u2212sn(x, m) dn(x, m) ,\ndx\ndx\nd\ndn(x, m) = \u2212m sn(x, m) cn(x, m).\ndx\n\n(10)\n\nFor example, differentiation of the p-point rank 2 identity (8) yields the rank 3 identity\ns1 c1 (d2 + dp ) + c.p. = 0 ,\n\n(11)\n\nwhich reduces to the well-known trigonometric identity\np\nX\ni=1\n\nsin[2x +\n\n2(i \u2212 1)\u03c0\n]=0\np\n\n(12)\n\nin the limit m = 0.\nAnother p-point rank r identity of interest for r \u2264 p is\nd1 d2 . . . dr + c.p. = A\n4\n\n(r even) ,\n\n(13)\n\n\fd1 d2 . . . dr + c.p. = B\n\np\nX\n\ndi\n\n(r odd) .\n\n(14)\n\ni\n\nOne also has similar identities involving s\u0303i or c\u0303i (instead of di ) for any odd value of p. All these identities\nhave the remarkable property of reducing the degree of the polynomial in the Jacobi functions from r\nto 0 (1) depending on whether r is even (odd). For small values of p and r, the constants A, B in eqs.\n(13) and (14) are easily evaluated. Some results are\n\u221a\nA(p = 2, r = 2) = 2 1 \u2212 m , A(p = 3, r = 2) = q(q + 2) , A(p = 4, r = 2) = 2t(1 + t2 ) ,\nB(p = 3, r = 3) = 3(\n\n\u221a\nm\n\u2212 1) , B(p = 4, r = 3) = 1 \u2212 m ,\n2\n1\u2212q\n\nA(p = 4, r = 4) = 4(1 \u2212 m) .\n\n(15)\n\nFor the special limiting cases m = 0 and m = 1, one gets\nA(m = 0, p, r) = p , B(m = 0, p, r) = 1 , A(m = 1, p, r) = B(m = 1, p, r) = 0 .\n\n(16)\n\nAnother way of obtaining additional identities is by manipulating established identities. For example, for p = 3 and r = 3, eq. (14) is\nd1 d2 d3 =\n\nB\n(d1 + d2 + d3 ) ,\n3\n\n(17)\n\nwhere B \u2261 B(p = 3, r = 3) is as given by eq. (15). Squaring identity (8) for p = 3 and using eqs. (15)\nand (17) yields the new identity\nd21 d22 + c.p. = \u22122(\n\n3\nX\nm\n6m\n\u2212\n1)\n\u2212 3 \u2212 4m)] .\nd2i + [(1 \u2212 q 2 )2 +\n2\n1\u2212q\n1 \u2212 q2\ni=1\n\n(18)\n\nA similar identity is also true for any p, and in fact we have used it in a crucial manner for obtaining\nnew periodic solutions of the KdV equation [9]. However, to establish this p-point identity, one needs\na generalization of identities (8) and (14). The generalized identities are\nd1 dn + c.p. = A , (n = 2, 3, 4, ...) ,\nand\nd1 dj1 dj2 + c.p. = B\n\np\nX\ni=1\n\ndi , (1 < j1 < j2 \u2264 p) ,\n\n(19)\n\n(20)\n\nwhich we have verified to be true both algebraically and numerically using Maple for many specific\nchoices of the integers n, j1 , j2 , p.\n5\n\n\f3. Discussion and comments\nBy the techniques described in the previous section, we have obtained a large number of new identities,\nmany of which are displayed in Tables 1, 2 and 3. It should be noted that the modulus parameter m\nis not transformed and remains unchanged in all identities. Although it is not easy to give a complete\nsystematic classification, we can comment on some general properties.\n(i) For any identity of rank r, the left hand side is a cyclic homogeneous polynomial expression of\ndegree r with p terms.\n(ii) If the polynomial on the left hand side is periodic with period 2K(m)/p [4K(m)/p], then the\nidentity involves arguments spaced by 2K(m)/p [4K(m)/p].\n(iii) The right hand side involves polynomials of rank r \u2212 2, r \u2212 4,... which are \"irreducible\", some examples being\n\nP\n\ndi ,\n\nP\n\ns\u0303i ,\n\nP\n\nc\u0303i ,\n\nP\n\nc\u0303i d \u0303i ,\n\nP\n\ns\u0303i d \u0303i ,\n\nP\n\nci si ,\n\nP\n\nci si di , etc. and all these irreducibles multiplied\n\nby d2n\ni where n = 1, 2, ....\n(iv) In general, many of the identities of higher rank can be obtained from those of lower rank by either\ndifferentiation or algebraic manipulation. Similarly, many of the identities of a given rank r (r > 2)\ncan be derived from lower rank identities as well as a few identities of the same rank. For example,\nfor p = 3, using the identities of rank 2 and three of the rank 3 identities as given by eqs. (32) to (34)\none can obtain all other identities of rank 3 as given in Table 2.\n(v) The generic constants A, B, C in any identity can be determined by choosing specific, convenient\nvalues of x in the arguments. The value x = 0 is a good choice in many cases. Note that for p \u2264 4,\nwe have given explicit values for all the constants appearing in the identities - for 3-point identities,\nall constants are expressed in terms of q \u2261 dn(2K(m)/3, m) , and for 4-point identities, all constants\nare expressed in terms of t \u2261 dn(K(m)/2, m) = (1 \u2212 m)1/4 . In writing the constants, we have made\nfrequent use of the relationship q 4 + 2q 3 + (m \u2212 1)(2q + 1) = 0.\n(vi) Some identities for even values of p involve alternating positive and negative signs. The symbol\n\"\u2212 c.p.\" in these identities refers to cyclic permutations with alternating signs. Many of these identities,\nlike d21 (d2 +dp )\u2212d22 (d3 +d1 ) * * *\u2212d2p (d1 +dp\u22121 ) = A(d1 \u2212d2 +* * *\u2212dp ), play a crucial role in determining\n6\n\n\fband edge wave functions of solvable quantum mechanical periodic potentials [8]. For p = 4 this\nidentity is easily derived by starting from identity (3) with A = 2t(1 + t2 ) and t = (1 \u2212 m)1/4 . On\nmultiplying both sides of this identity by (d1 \u2212 d2 + d3 \u2212 d4 ) and using the relations d1 d3 = d2 d4 =\n\u221a\n1 \u2212 m, we immediately obtain the 4-point identity\nd21 (d2 + d4 ) \u2212 c.p. = 2t(1 + t + t2 )(d1 \u2212 c.p.) .\n\n(21)\n\n(vii) It should be noted that our identities involve cyclic permutations \u00b1c.p. of terms which have no\nclockwise or anticlockwise \"handedness\". For example, for even p, there is no identity of the type\n(d21 d2 \u2212 c.p.) proportional to (d1 \u2212 c.p.), since the term d21 d2 has a clockwise handedness. It is only\nwhen one adds on an anticlockwise handed term d21 dp that the the combination [d21 (d2 + dp ) \u2212 c.p.] is\nindeed proportional to (d1 \u2212 c.p.).\n(viii) In the limit m \u2192 0, one recovers many known non-trivial trigonometric identities. In the limit\nm \u2192 1, since the period K(1) \u2192 \u221e, one usually gets trivial hyperbolic function identities. Both these\nlimits serve as a useful check on all the new identities involving Jacobi elliptic functions obtained in\nthis paper. Of course, as mentioned previously, software packages like Maple or Mathematica quickly\nprovide confirmation of any identity to typically eight digit accuracy.\n(ix) Identities for a given value of p, contain identities of the factors of p as special cases. For example,\nfor even p, only half of d1 , ..., dp are independent since they satisfy identities\nd1 d p+2 = ... = d p dp =\n2\n\n2\n\n\u221a\n1\u2212m ,\n\n(22)\n\ncoming from p = 2. Similarly, the full list of p = 6 identities contains p = 2, 3 identities. For example,\n\u221a\nd1 d4 = d2 d5 = d3 d6 = 1 \u2212 m and similarly d1 d3 + d3 d5 + d5 d1 = d2 d4 + d4 d6 + d6 d2 = q 2 + 2q, where\nq is as given by eq. (7).\n(x) It should be noted that in many applications like finding new solutions of the KdV equation [9], the\nidentities needed involve summations over all combinations of many (say two) indices i, j = 1, . . . , p.\nThese combinations correspond to the sum of several cyclic identities discussed in the tables.\n(xi) In this paper, we have concentrated our attention on cyclic identities in which the arguments\nare separated by fractions of the periods 2K(m) or 4K(m) on the real axis. However, each one of\n7\n\n\four identities can be easily translated into a corresponding one in which the arguments are separated\nby fractions of the periods i2K \u2032 or i4K \u2032 on the imaginary axis, where K \u2032 \u2261 K(1 \u2212 m). For exam\u221a\nple, the simple 2-point identity dn(x, m) dn(x + K(m), m) = 1 \u2212 m translates to the new identity\n\u221a\nsn(u, m) sn(u + iK \u2032 , m) = 1/ m. The general procedure consists of first replacing m by 1 \u2212 m [which\n\u221a\n\u221a\nin alternative standard notation [4] corresponds to replacing k \u2261 m by k\u2032 \u2261 1 \u2212 m and K(m) by\nK \u2032 ], then using the well-known results\nsn(x, 1 \u2212 m) = \u221a\n\ni cn(ix + K, m)\ndn(ix + K, m)\n, cn(x, 1 \u2212 m) = \u221a\n,\n1 \u2212 m sn(ix + K, m)\n1 \u2212 m sn(ix + K, m)\ndn(x, 1 \u2212 m) =\n\n1\n,\nsn(ix + K, m)\n\nand finally changing to a new variable u = ix + K.\nIn conclusion, even though Jacobi elliptic functions have been studied for approximately two centuries, it is exciting to discover new cyclic identities connecting them. What makes our results doubly\nexciting is that the identities play a vital role in the study of periodic potentials [8] and in yielding\nnew solutions of nonlinear differential equations of physical interest [9].\nAcknowledgment\nOne of us (A.K) thanks the Department of Physics at the University of Illinois at Chicago for hospitality.
