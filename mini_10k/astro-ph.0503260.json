Introduction\nThe very low mass M dwarfs are small, cool and faint, but they\ndominate the Galaxy by number (\u223c50-70%), and even by total mass (\u223c70%)(Chabrier 2003). Any realistic model of the\nGalaxy therefore needs an excellent description of this faint\ncomponent. Over the last decade, stellar models of very low\nmass stars have made great strides, but they still have to use\nsome incomplete or approximate input physics (Chabrier &\nBaraffe 2000). Descriptions of these stars therefore need a\nstrong empirical basis, or validation.\nIn S\u00e9gransan et al. (2003) and Delfosse et al. (2000, hereafter DFS00), we have validated the model predictions for\nradii and luminosities. The empirical radii match the models\nvery well, and have no dispersion beyond the measurement\nerrors. The infrared mass-luminosity (hereafter M/L) relations\nalso have negligible dispersion, and similarly agree with model\npredictions. The V-band M/L relation, in contrast, has a large\nSend offprint requests to: X.

In DFS00 we suggested that metallicity might explain most of this intrinsic dispersion, but for\nlack of quantitative metallicity estimates we could not pursue\nthis suggestion.\nM-dwarf metallicities have also become relevant in the context of planet formation around very low mass stars. One robust\nresult of the exoplanet searches is that G and K stars which\nhost planets are on average more metal-rich than the bulk of\nthe solar neighbourhood population (Gonzalez 1997; Santos et\nal. 2001, 2003, 2004). A leading explanation for this observation is that the disks of metal-rich stars contain larger amounts\nof refractory dust, and that more massive dust disks are much\nmore likely to form planets. This has a clear bearing on planets around M dwarfs, since these low mass stars are likely to\nhave smaller disks than solar-type stars of the same metallicity.\nAssuming that protostellar disk mass scales with stellar mass\nand within the core-accretion scenario, Laughlin et al. (2004)\nand Ida & Lin (2005) show that formation of Jupiter-mass planets is seriously inhibited around the less massive M dwarfs\n(M\u22c6 < 0.4M\u2299 ). To date, the only two M dwarfs known to host\nplanets are Gl 876 (Delfosse et al. 1998; Marcy et al. 1998,\n2001) and Gl 436 (Butler et al. 2004), but a number of ongoing\n\n\f2\n\nX.

They will\nbring new constraints on the frequency of planets as a function\nof stellar mass, and metallicity will be one of the key parameters in the comparison with solar-type targets.\nMeasuring M-dwarf metallicities from their spectra is unfortunately difficult. As the spectral subtype increases, the atmospheres of these cool stars (\u223c 3800 K (M0) > T e f f >\u223c\n2100 K (M9)) contain increasingly abundant diatomic and triatomic molecules (TiO, VO, H2 O, CO, FeH, CrH...), which\nspectroscopically defines the M class. These components have\ncomplex and extensive absorption band structures, which eventually leave no continuum point in the spectrum. In a late-M\ndwarf, the local pseudo-continuum estimated from a high resolution spectrum is defined by a forest a weak lines, and often underestimates the true continuum by a factor of a few.\nThe \"line-by-line\" spectroscopic analysis used for hotter stars\ntherefore becomes impossible for late-M dwarfs, and a full\nspectral synthesis must be used. Besides the practical complexities of that approach, the atmospheric models do not yet reproduce the details of high resolution spectra (mostly due to limitations of their molecular opacity databases). This therefore\nleaves some doubt about the reliability of the resulting metallicities. Here we instead observe visual binaries that contain\nboth an M-dwarf and a solar-type star.

Previous metallicity estimates of M dwarfs\nThe first attempt to measure metallicities for M dwarfs was\nby Mould (1976, 1978) who performed line-by-line analyses\nof atomic lines in intermediate resolution near-IR spectra of\na few stars, using model atmospheres available then. Jones\net al. (1996) used a similar approach, but with the benefit of\natmospheric structures from an early version of the modern\nPHOENIX code (Allard & Hauschildt, 1995). Gizis (1997)\nmatched low resolution optical spectra to synthetic spectra\nfrom the same Allard & Hauschildt (1995) models, and derived\nrelatively crude metallicities that allowed them to classify M\ndwarfs into 3 broad categories (dwarfs, subdwarfs and extreme\nsubdwarfs). Gizis and Reid (1997) validated that metallicity\nscale with observations of binary stars containing one M-dwarf\ncomponent and one warmer star.\nValenti et al. (1998) performed detailed spectral synthesis of a very high resolution spectrum of Gl 725 B (vB 10) to\n\n\fX. Bonfils et al.: Metallicity of M dwarfs\n\n3\n\nTable 3.

Zboril & Byrne (1998)\nmatched high resolution red spectra (5500-9000 \u00c5) of 7 K and\n11 M dwarfs to Allard & Hauschildt (1995) synthetic spectra.\nThey conclude that for the M dwarfs the resulting metallicities\nare only indicative, a conclusion that probably applies to most\nprevious references, at least for the later subtypes. Jones et al.\n(2002) synthesized the water vapor bands for Infrared Space\nObservatory (ISO) 2.5-3 \u03bcm spectra of 3 M dwarfs to derive\ntheir parameters.\nThe limited overlap between these studies shows that they\nhave not yet converged to consistency. Gl 725 B was measured\nby both Valenti et al. (1998) and Zboril & Byrne (1998), who\nrespectively derive [M/H]=\u22120.92 and [M/H]=\u22120.15. Jones et\nal. (1996, 2002), Zboril & Byrne (1998) and Dawson & De\nRobertis (2004) all measured Barnard's star and found subsolar to solar metallicity, but the values spread from \u22120.75 to\n0.0 dex. Kapteyn's star is also consistently found to be submetallic (Mould 1976; Jones 2002; Woolf & Wallerstein 2004,\n2005), as expected from its population II kinematics but again\nwith some dispersion.\nThe above references attempt to simultaneously determine\nthe effective temperature (Te f f ), the gravity (log g) and the\nmetallicity ([M/H]), by minimizing the difference between observed and model spectra. Unfortunately the 3 parameters are\nstrongly coupled, in particular for spectra that are not flux calibrated. Furthermore, the models do not yet reproduce the observed spectra in perfect detail, mostly due to remaining shortcomings in their molecular transition databases, especially for\nthe later subtypes. The interpretation therefore involves estimations as to which features of the spectra should be ignored and\nwhich should be given maximum weight, and to some extent\nthe process remains an art. Different practitioners would likely\nobtain somewhat different answers from the same data and at-\n\nmospheric models, and they definitely do when they analyse\ndifferent spectral bands observed with different spectral resolutions.\nThe recent analyses of Kapteyn's and Barnard's stars by\nWoolf & Wallerstein (2004) and Dawson & De Robertis\n(2004), by contrast, are anchored in model-independent Te f f\nand log g values from S\u00e9gransan et al. (2003). S\u00e9gransan et\nal. (2003) combined their interferometric radius measurements\nwith the bolometric flux to determine Te f f , reversing the more\nusual procedure of determining stellar radii from effective temperature and luminosity, and they computed the gravity from\nthe linear radius and a mass derived from the well constrained\nK band mass-luminosity relation. Woolf & Wallerstein (2004)\nand Dawson & De Robertis (2004) could therefore concentrate\nthe full information content of their spectra on determining the\nmetallicity, free of any uncontrolled coupling with the other atmospheric parameters.\nWoolf & Wallerstein (2005, hereafter WW05) analysed a\nmuch larger sample of 35 K and M dwarfs, that for now do\nnot have interferometric radius measurements. WW05 therefore rely on photometric effective temperatures (Te f f ) and they\nuse a photometric radius to compute the gravity. While less\ndirect than the S\u00e9gransan et al. (2003) measurements, this\nprocedure rests on relations which that paper validates, and\nthat in our view is currently preferable to determining those\nparameters from the spectrum. The 15 Woolf & Wallerstein\n(2005) M dwarfs are overwhelmingly of early subtypes (only\none is later than M1.5) and they concentrate on low metallicity targets. Their spectra therefore have limited molecular\nveiling. Together with their use of the latest generation of the\nPHOENIX models, this reduces their sensitivity to the remaining shortcomings of the molecular opacity databases. The parameter space which they cover complements our own mea-\n\n\f4\n\nX. Bonfils et al.: Metallicity of M dwarfs\n\nsurements, and we make extensive use of these data in our discussion.\n\n3. Observations and analysis\n\n3.1. Sample, observation and data reduction\nWe selected wide physical visual binaries composed of an\nF-, G- or K-primary component and an M-dwarf secondary,\nfrom the Gliese & Jareiss (1991) catalogue of nearby stars, the\nPoveda et al. (1994) catalogue of wide-binary and multiple systems of nearby stars, and the Gould & Chanam\u00e9 (2004) list\nof physical HIPPARCOS binaries. We further required that the\ncomponents be separated by at least 5\u2032\u2032 and that the secondary\nbe brighter than V=14, to facilitate observations of the faint M\ndwarf. Fast rotators, double-lined spectroscopic binaries (SB2)\nand close visual binaries were rejected a priori when known,\nand otherwise discarded a posteriori. These criteria resulted in\na list of 70 pairs.\nWe discarded 2 systems whose secondaries (GJ 3409 B and\nGl 771 B) were SB2 binaries (reported in Table 2). The Gl 549\nsystem had to be rejected as the F7V primary is a fast rotator\n(vsin i \u223c 50 km.s\u22121 ). The Gl 695 system was also rejected as\nboth components are themselves close visual binaries. Here we\nanalyse 21 of those systems (Table 1), of which 20 have Mdwarf secondaries (the last one being classified as K7V).\nMost of the spectra were gathered using the ELODIE spectrograph (Baranne et al. 1996) on the 1.93-m telescope of\nObservatoire de Haute-Provence (France). ELODIE covers a\nvisible spectral range from 3850 to 6800 \u00c5 with a resolution of\n45000. For GJ 1021, Gl 166 A and Gl 250 A we reuse spectra observed by Santos et al. (2001) with the CORALIE spectrograph (1.20-m Swiss Telescope, La Silla Observatory ESO,\nChile). CORALIE has a slightly wider spectral range than\nELODIE, 3650 to 6900 \u00c5, and a slightly higher resolution of\n50000. On-line processing is integrated with control software\nof both spectrographs, and automatically produces optimally\nextracted, flat-fielded and wavelength calibrated spectra, with\nalgorithms described in Baranne et al. (1996). For all primaries\nthe present observations used the \"Object-only\" mode of the\nspectrograph, where its optional reference fiber is not illuminated. This mode provides optimal scattered light correction,\nat the cost of degraded radial velocity precision (\u223c100 m.s\u22121 ).\nThe wavelength calibration used a single Thorium-Argon exposure obtained at the beginning of each night. For each primary\nwe recorded a sequence of 3 spectra, and applied a median filter\nto remove any unflagged cosmic ray hit. The combined spectra have signal-to-noise ratios of approximately 200 per pixel\n(\u223c300 per resolution element), amply sufficient for our spectroscopic analysis. We also obtained spectra for the secondaries,\nusually with a much lower signal to noise ratio, from which\nwe planned to derive spectroscopic metallicity diagnostics that\ncan be applied at moderate/low signal to noise ratio data. That\ngoal has proved more difficult than we expected, and it will be\ndiscussed in a future paper if we are successful.\n\nFig. 1.

Spectroscopic analysis\nOur spectroscopic analysis of the primaries follows the procedure described by Santos et al. (2004) for planet host stars.\nBriefly, we used the Gaussian fitting procedure of the IRAF\nsplot task to the measure equivalent widths (W\u03bb ) of 39 Fe I\nand 12 Fe II lines. The stellar parameters were then derived\nusing the 2002 version of the MOOG code (Sneden 1973),\nand a grid of Kurucz (1993) ATLAS9 model atmospheres.\n\n\fX.

The filled circles correspond to our metallicity determinations and the\nopen circles to those from WW05. The symbol size is proportional to the metallicity. The dashed lines represent isometallicity\ncontours for the polynomial relation of Eq. 1, spaced by 0.25 dex from \u22121.50 dex (left) to +0.25 dex (right). The right-hand axis\nshows masses from the DFS00 K-band Mass-luminosity, which has very low dispersion and allows to interpret the figure as a\nMass-Colour-Metallicity diagram. Gl 876 and Gl 436, the two known M-dwarf planet-host stars, are indicated to illustrate their\nsolar metallicity. Right panels: Residuals from the calibration as a function of both MK and V\u2212K photometry.\nTable 3 presents the resulting atmospheric parameters (microturbulence, effective temperature (Te f f ), surface gravity and\niron abundance ([Fe/H]), which we use as a measurement of\nthe overall metallicity ([M/H]).\nThe standard errors on Teff , log g, \u03bet and [Fe/H] were derived as described in Santos et al. (2004), following the prescriptions of Gonzalez & Vanture (1998). The resulting uncertainties are internal, in the sense that they ignore possible\nscale offsets. There is currently some disagreement on e.g. the\napropriate temperature scale for solar-type dwarfs, as well as\nwhich model atmospheres better reproduce the real stellar atmospheres. The true errors may consequently be larger, but the\nlisted standard errors are appropriate for comparisons within\nour sample. As discussed in Santos et al. (2004, 2005), the\nmethod and the grid of ATLAS9 atmospheres used gives excellent results, compatible with those derived by other authors\nusing other model atmospheres and methods to derive the stellar parameters and metallicities.\nSix of the observed primaries have published stellar parameters (Santos et al. 2004; Edvardsson et al. 1993). Comparison\nof our determinations of Te f f and [Fe/H] with these litterature\nvalues (Fig. 1) shows that they agree to within the stated errors.\n\n4. A photometric calibration of M-dwarf\nmetallicities\nFrom this point on, we use a sample (Table 4) that combines our\nown metallicity measurements with those of WW05. As discussed above, we expect the latter to be reliable, and they reach\nto lower metallicities for mostly hotter atmospheres. The two\n\ndatasets are therefore complementary, but they have enough\noverlap in the (Te f f ,[Fe/H]) plane to assess possible systematic differences (Fig. 2). Table 4 contains all WW05 stars with\nknown parallaxes, except LHS 1138, listed as a G5 dwarf in\nSIMBAD, and GJ 1064 D, a clear outlier in our relations and\nperhaps a photometric binary. We restrict the analysis to stars\nbrighter than MK =7.5, since the sampling is very sparse for\nfainter stars.\nThe left panel of Fig. 2 displays the effect of metallicity in the MK vs V\u2212K observational Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, with symbol sizes proportional to the metallicity of the\ncorresponding stars. After experimenting with several colourmagnitude diagrams, we found that amongst commonly available photometric bands this combination maximizes the metallicity sentivity. It is immediately obvious that lower metallicity\nstars are much bluer at a given absolute MK magnitude, and we\nfind the metallicity well described by the following polynomial\nrelation between MK and V\u2212K:\n[Fe/H] = 0.196 \u2212 1.527 MK + 0.091 MK2\n+1.886(V \u2212 K) \u2212 0.142(V \u2212 K)2 ,\n\n(1)\n\nvalid for MK \u2208 [4, 7.5], V \u2212 K \u2208 [2.5, 6] and [Fe/H] \u2208\n[\u22121.5, +0.2] and with an observed dispersion of only 0.2 dex.\nPart of this dispersion might be due to a few of the higher\nmass stars having evolved slightly off the main sequence. For\ninstance between 8 Gyr and 10 Gyr an 0.8 M\u2299 star brightens by \u223c0.3 mag in the V band and \u223c0.2 mag in the K band,\nmoving noticeably in the Fig. 2 diagram. By 0.7 M\u2299 stellar\nevolution effects become small, with a brightening between\n8 Gyr to 12 Gyr of \u223c0.1 mag in both the V and K bands. The\n\n\f6\n\nX.

The\nfilled circles represent our metallicity determinations and the\nopen circles those from WW05. The symbol size is proportional to the metallicity, and the dashed contours represent\nisometallicity for the Eq. 1 calibration, spaced by 0.25 dex from\n+0.25 (left) to -1.5 dex (right). The solid lines represents the Vband empirical M/L relation of DFS00.\nage/metallicity relation might therefore introduce a small systematic bias in our relation, but that would affect at most the\nhighest mass fringe of its validity range.\nThe lower panels of Fig. 2 display the residuals from that\nrelation. The absence of any obvious systematic pattern demonstrates that the calibration remains valid over its stated range.\nThe consistency between the residuals of the WW05 measurements and ours ensures that any systematic difference between\nthe two datasets must be small where they overlap, for approximately solar metallicities. For significantly subsolar metallicities (i.e. well below -0.25 dex) we have no independent validation of the WW05 data. It should be noted however that\ntheir approach has maximal uncertainties for high metallicities,\nwhere molecular veiling is most severe. The good agreement\nwhere difficulties would be most expected suggests that the low\nmetallicity data points are valid as well.\n\n5. The V-band mass-luminosity relation\nAs demonstrated by DFS00, the infrared J-, H- and K-band\nM/L relations are very tight and in excellent agreement with\nmodel predictions, while the V-band relation has a large intrinsic scatter. The contrasting dispersions were qualitatively\nexpected from different metallicity sensitivities for the visual\nand infrared bands (e.g. Chabrier & Baraffe 2000), but the extent of the effect was a surprise to most observers. Metallicity\naffects luminosity through a given photometric filter in two\nways. First, higher metallicity decreases the bolometric lumi-\n\nFig. 4. Metallicity of M and K dwarfs (filled circles for our\nmeasurements, and open circles for WW05 data) as a function\nof the difference (\u2206M) between masses calculated from the Vand K-band M/L relations of DFS00.\n\nnosity for a given mass, and second, it shifts flux from the\nvisible range to the near-IR through higher line-blanketing by\nTiO and VO molecular bands. The two mechanisms work together to decrease the luminosity of the more metal-rich stars\nthrough visible filters. In the near-IR by contrast, the redward\nshift of the flux distribution of the metal-rich stars counteracts their lower bolometric luminosity. The models therefore\npredict IR absolute magnitudes that are largely insensitive to\nmetallicity, and the tight empirical M/L relations confirm this.\nDFS00 could on the other hand not quantitatively verify their\nsuggestion that metallicity explains the V-band dispersion. The\nTable 4 measurements now allow us to perform this verification.\nSince the K-band M/L relation is so tight, we can use the\nparallaxes and 2MASS photometry to derive accurate masses.\nFig. 3 displays those masses (MassK ) as a function of the MV\nabsolute magnitude, with symbol sizes proportional to the measured metallicity. The figure also shows the DFS00 V-band\nM/L relation, and isometallicity contours obtained by remapping Eq. 1 to the Mass/MV plane. It is immediately obvious\nthat the position relative to the average M/L relation correlates\nwith metallicity, with the smallest symbols far above the M/L\nrelation and the largest ones under that relation.\nFig. 4 provides a more quantitative view, by projecting the\nMass/MV /[Fe/H] information along the average V-band M/L\nrelation. This diagram of [Fe/H] as a function of the difference\nbetween masses derived from the V- and K-band M/L relations\nshows a well-defined linear correlation ([Fe/H] = \u22120.149 \u2212\n6.508 \u2206M, \u03c3([Fe/H]) = 0.21). This demonstrates i) that the\nobserved dispersion indeed results primarily from a metallicity\neffect, and ii) that the luminosity shift for a given metallicity is,\nto first order, constant between 0.8 and 0.2 M\u2299 .\n\n\fX.

Bonfils et al.: Metallicity of M dwarfs\n\nWe now have all the elements in hand to examine how the\nV-band luminosity depends on mass and metallicity, and to\ncompute a mass-metallicity-luminosity relation for very-lowmass stars. We find that the V-band luminosity is well described\nby the following polynomial relation:\nMV = 15.844 \u2212 16.534 Mass + 13.891 Mass2\n\u22127.411 Mass3 + 1.153 [Fe/H]\n\n(2)\n\nfor Mass \u2208 [0.2 M\u2299 , 0.8 M\u2299 ] and [Fe/H] \u2208 [\u22121.5, 0.2], and\nwith a dispersion of 0.28 mag.\n\n6. Metallicity of M-dwarf planet-host stars\nIt is now well established that planet host stars are more\nmetal-rich than the average solar neighbourhood population\n(Gonzalez 1997; Santos et al. 2001, 2003, 2004). Santos et\nal. established that the planet frequency rises very steeply with\nstellar metallicity, at least for [Fe/H] > 0. While only \u223c3% of\nthe solar metallicity stars are orbited by a (detected) planet, this\nfraction increases to over 25% for stars with [Fe/H] above +0.3.\nOne leading explanation for this dramatic dependency is\nthat the probability of planet formation increases non-linearly\nwith the mass of dust in a proto-planetary disk. M dwarfs, with\npresumably smaller disks and hence smaller disk dust mass at a\ngiven metallicity, provide a potentially critical test of that idea.\nThis has up to now been hampered by both small statistic, with\nonly two M-dwarf planet hosts known to date, and the lack of\nreliable metallicity estimates for those stars. Our calibration resolves the second of those difficulties, and shows that Gl 876\nand Gl 436, the two known M-dwarf planet-host stars, both\nhave closely solar metallicities (\u22120.03 dex and +0.02 dex, respectively). Those unremarkable metal abundances do not shed\nlight on whether M dwarf planet hosts are preferentially metalrich or not. Larger samples will be needed for that, and our\ncalibration will be a useful tool when they become available.\n\nFig. 5. Upper panel : M-dwarf metallicity distribution derived\nfrom Eq. 1 and, over-plotted in dashed line, the metallicity distribution of 1000 non-variable stars of our CORALIE radialvelocity planet-search programme. Bottom panel : Cumulative\ndistributions of the same samples.\ntest gives an \u223c 8% probability that the two samples are drawn\nfrom the same parent distribution. The significance of the offset is therefore modest, but if real is in the expected direction.\nSince M-dwarfs have much longer lifetimes than the age of the\nuniverse, every M-dwarf that ever formed is still here for us\nto see, while some of the oldest solar-type stars have evolved\nto white dwarfs. M dwarfs are thus expected to be slightly\nolder on average, and from the age-metallicity relation therefore slightly more metal-poor.\n\n7. Metallicity distribution of M dwarfs\nEquation 1 allows us to estimate the metallicity of any individual M dwarfs with V- and K-band photometry and a well determined parallax. Here we use it to evaluate the metallicity distribution of the Delfosse et al. (2005, in prep) sample of northern\nM dwarfs within 9.25 parsecs. This volume-limited sample is\nbelieved to be complete, and is therefore representative of the\nsolar neighbourhood. We removed all unresolved binaries as\nwell as the faintest stars which are outside the validity range of\nthe calibration (K \u2208 [4 mag, 7.5 mag]). Table 5 lists the 47 remaining stars with their estimated metallicity. For comparison,\nwe consider a sample of 1000 non-binary solar-type stars from\nthe CORALIE radial-velocity planet-search programme (Udry\net al. 2000). This sample of single F, G or K dwarfs is representative of the solar neighbourhood, and we estimate their\nmetallicity using the Santos et al. (2002) calibration of the area\nof the cross-correlation function between the stellar spectra and\nan appropriate template. We display the two distributions and\ntheir cumulative functions (Fig. 5). The two distribution have\nsimilar shapes, but with a \u223c 0.07 dex shift of the M-dwarf distribution towards lower metallicities. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov\n\n8. Conclusions\nWe have determined the metallicities of 20 M dwarfs in widebinary systems that also contain an F, G or K star, under the\nsimple assumption that the two stars have the same composition. Where the parameter spaces overlap, our results are consistent with the direct analysis of M-dwarf spectra by Woolf\n& Wallerstein (2005). This provides a welcome validation of\nboth our assumptions of a common composition and of the\nWW05 analysis of complex M-dwarf spectra. The two datasets\ncover complementary parameter ranges, and we join them to\nderive a photometric calibration of very low-mass star metallicities. The calibration is valid between 0.8 and 0.2 M\u2299 , needs\nV- and K-band photometry and an accurate parallax, and provides metallicity estimates with \u223c0.2 dex uncertainties. A 5%\nparallax uncertainty results in an additional \u223c0.2 dex metallicity uncertainty, making the relation useful only within \u223c50 pc.\nWe use the new metallicities to take a fresh look at the Vband mass-luminosity relation, and demonstrate that its intrinsic dispersion is indeed due to metallicity. We apply the new\ncalibration to the two known M dwarfs that host planets, Gl 876\n\n\fX. Bonfils et al.: Metallicity of M dwarfs\n\n9\n\nTable 5.

Larger samples\nof M-dwarf planet hosts will be needed to investigate whether\nthey are preferentially metal-rich, as are their solar-type counterparts. Finally, we estimate metallicities for a volume-limited\nsample of 47 M dwarfs, and compare its metallicity distribution\n\nto that of a much larger sample of solar-type stars. The difference between the two distributions is small, but if real might\nreflect slightly older average ages for the long-lived M-dwarfs.\nIn a forthcoming paper we will publish metallicities for a larger\nsample of M-dwarfs in binaries, observed from the southern\n\n\f10\n\nX.
