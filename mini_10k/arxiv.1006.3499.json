In conventional low-energy nuclear physics the relevant subnuclear degrees of\nfreedom are considered to be mesons and nucleon isobars. Electron scattering affords an\nexcellent tool for studying these degrees of freedom which are manifested in the transverse\nresponse through meson exchange (MEC) and isobar (IC) currents. The consideration of\nsuch subnuclear currents has a long history in the physics of few-nucleon systems. For\ntwo-body systems a review can be found in [2]. One important issue in the MEC is their\nconsistency with the nucleon-nucleon (NN) potential being used. Such consistent MEC's\nhave not only been taken into account in deuteron electrodisintegration, but also in the\nelectrodisintegration of three-body systems [3\u20137]. On the other hand IC have not received\nthe attention in three-body systems which they have in the two-nucleon sector. Nevertheless\nthere exists a rather complete calculation by [5, 8, 9] where N and \u2206 degrees of freedom\nhave been treated on an equivalent level via a coupled channel calculation with NNN and\nNN\u2206 channels. Also \u2206-effects have been studied [3] in 3 He electrodisintegration below the\nthree-body breakup threshold using the transition-correlation-operator method [10].\nThe present work incorporates the dynamics of the \u2206-resonance into the many-body\nwavefunction by means of the impulse approximation (IA) [11]. This method, as in the\ntransition-correlation-operator and coupled channel methods, avoids the static approximation by fully including the kinetic energy in the \u2206-propagator. For electromagnetic deuteron\nbreakup it has been shown that the \u2206-effects resulting from an IA calculation are rather\nsimilar to those resulting from a coupled channel calculation if the energy is sufficiently\nbelow the resonance position of the \u2206 [12].\nA calculation of RT in our case requires an integration over continuum states of the\ncoupled NNN + NN\u2206 system. As has been demonstrated previously [13, 14] the Lorentz\nintegral transform (LIT) method is well suited for calculating inclusive quantities such as\nresponse functions. Examples of its use in calculating electron scattering response functions\nof three- and four-body nuclei employing realistic nuclear forces (two- and three-body forces)\ninclude (i) nonrelativistic calculations of RL for three-nucleon systems [15], for 4 He [16]\nand inclusion of relativistic effects in 3 H and 3 He [17] and (ii) calculations of RT with\nrelativistic and consistent MEC contributions for three-body nuclei [6, 7, 18]. There is an\n2\n\n\fLIT calculation [19] of RT for 4 He but with semi-realistic NN forces. The method has not\npreviously been applied to the coupled NNN+NN\u2206 system so that this paper is the first in\nthat regard.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section II we describe the general formalism including the incorporation of \u2206 degrees of freedom in the LIT formalism. Section III specifies\nthe input to the dynamical equations developed in section II. This includes subsection A\ndetailing the potentials used in the NNN and NN\u2206 sectors, subsection B describing the electromagnetic current operators used and subsection C outlining calculational details. Finally\nour results are discussed in section IV. There we compare our results for RT to those from\nanother calculation and to experimental data.\n\nII.\n\nFORMALISM\n\nIn the one photon exchange approximation the cross section for the process of inclusive\nelectron scattering on a nucleus is given by\n\u0013\n\u0015\n\u0014 4\n\u0012 2\nd2 \u03c3\nQ\nQ\n2 \u03b8\nRT (q, \u03c9) ,\n= \u03c3M ott\nRL (q, \u03c9) +\n+ tan\nd\u03a9 d\u03c9\nq4\n2q 2\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere RL and RT are the longitudinal and transverse response functions respectively, \u03c9 is\nthe electron energy loss, q is the magnitude of the electron momentum transfer, \u03b8 is the\nelectron scattering angle, and Q2 = q 2 \u2212 \u03c9 2 .\nIn the present work we study the transverse response function,\nZ\nX X\ndf (j\u2020t )if * (jt )f i \u03b4(Ef \u0304 \u2212 Ei \u2212 \u03c9)\nRT (q, \u03c9) =\nMi\n\n(2)\n\nwith \u2206 degrees of freedom within a non-relativistic approach. The low \u03c9 region is considered.\nIn (2) the subscripts i and f label, respectively, an initial state and final states, and the\nmatrix elements are taken between internal states, center-of-mass motion being excluded.\nAs mentioned in the introduction we employ the IA in order to take into account the\n\u2206-resonance. This approximation is used for both the 3 He ground state and the final state.\nBelow we outline the various theoretical aspects required to include \u2206 degrees of freedom\nin a calculation of RT via the LIT method.\nWe consider the three-nucleon system with N(939) and \u2206(1232) degrees of freedom,\n\n3\n\n\fwhich leads to the following Hamiltonian\nH = T + \u03b4m + V =\n\n3\nX\n\n(Ti + \u03b4mi ) +\n\ni=1\n\n3\nX\n\nVij ,\n\n(3)\n\ni<j\n\nwhere Ti is the kinetic energy of particle i with mass mi , \u03b4mi = mi \u2212mN is its mass difference\nwith nucleon N(939), and Vij = Vji is the potential between particles i and j. By omitting\nthe contribution from more than one \u2206-isobar excitation, we construct the three-particle\nbound state from an NNN part and a NN\u2206 part i.e.,\n\u2206\n|\u03a80 i = |\u03a8N\n0 i + |\u03a80 i .\n\n(4)\n\nThe wave function is determined by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation\nN N,N \u2206\n(TN + V\u0304 N N \u2212 E)|\u03a8N\n|\u03a8\u2206\n0 i = \u2212V\n0 i,\nN\u2206\nN \u2206,N N\n(H\u2206 \u2212 E)|\u03a8\u2206\n\u2212 E)|\u03a8\u2206\n|\u03a8N\n0 i = (\u03b4m + T\u2206 + V\n0 i = \u2212V\n0 i,\n\n(5)\n(6)\n\nP\n\u2032 \u2032\nwhere V N1 N2 ,N1 N2 = 3i<j Vij (N1 N2 \u2192 N1\u2032 N2\u2032 ), V\u0304 N N = V\u0304 N N,N N , V N \u2206 = V N \u2206,N \u2206 , and\nP3\ni=1 Ti is denoted by TN and T\u2206 for the NNN and NN\u2206 channels, respectively. One\n\nshould note that V\u0304 N N is different from the usual sum of realistic NN potentials, V N N ,\n\nbecause the latter already contain implicit effects due to the \u2206 (e.g., in meson theoretical\nNN potentials realized via part of the \u03c3 meson exchange).\nHere we do not search for a direct solution of the coupled channel problem represented\n\u2206\nby Eqs. (5,6). Instead we use the IA where one computes \u03a8N\n0 and \u03a80 separately. More\n\nspecifically one first determines the NNN part by solving\n(HN \u2212 E)|\u03a8N\n0 i = 0\n\n(7)\n\nHN = TN + V N N + V N N N ,\n\n(8)\n\nwith\n\nwhere V N N N =\n\nP3\n\ni<j<k\n\nVijk is a three-nucleon force. In the IA one then uses the solution\n\n\u2206\n|\u03a8N\n0 i in order to calculate |\u03a80 i through (6).\n\nTreatment of the continuum in the LIT technique requires the calculation of a localized\nLorentz state |\u03a8\u0303i. This Lorentz state |\u03a8\u0303i also has NNN and NN\u2206 parts written as\n|\u03a8\u0303i = |\u03a8\u0303N i + |\u03a8\u0303\u2206 i .\n4\n\n(9)\n\n\fThese fulfill the coupled equations\n\u2206\n(TN + V\u0304 N N \u2212 E0 \u2212 \u03c3)|\u03a8\u0303N i = \u2212V N N,N \u2206 |\u03a8\u0303\u2206 i + ON N |\u03a8N\n0 i + ON \u2206 |\u03a80 i ,\n\u2206\n(\u03b4m + T\u2206 + V N \u2206 \u2212 E0 \u2212 \u03c3)|\u03a8\u0303\u2206 i = \u2212V N \u2206,N N |\u03a8\u0303N i + O\u2206N |\u03a8N\n0 i + O\u2206\u2206 |\u03a80 i ,\n\n(10)\n(11)\n\nwhere E0 is the three-body ground-state energy, the complex \u03c3 = \u03c3R + i\u03c3I is the argument\nof the LIT in the transformed space, and the ON1 N2 denote the various diagonal (N1 = N2 ))\nand transition (N1 6= N2 ) electromagnetic current operators. One first solves for the NNN\npart using HN of Eq. (8):\n\u2206\n(HN \u2212 E0 \u2212 \u03c3)|\u03a8\u0303N i = \u2212V N N,N \u2206 (H\u2206 \u2212 E0 \u2212 \u03c3)\u22121 O\u2206N |\u03a8N\n0 i + O\u2206\u2206 |\u03a80 i\n\u2206\n+ON N |\u03a8N\n0 i + ON \u2206 |\u03a80 i .\n\n\u0001\n\n(12)\n\nThe above equation is derived by solving (11) formally for |\u03a8\u0303\u2206 i, inserting the solution in\n(10), and dropping the term V N N,N \u2206 (H\u2206 \u2212E0 \u2212\u03c3)\u22121 V N \u2206,N N , since, as mentioned, \u2206-effects\n\nto the nuclear interaction are already contained in the realistic HN . With |\u03a8\u0303N i thus obtained\n\none then calculates |\u03a8\u0303\u2206 i in a second step through (11). Given the solutions |\u03a8\u0303N i and |\u03a8\u0303\u2206 i\nthe LIT is obtained from the norm of the Lorentz state as\nh\u03a8\u0303|\u03a8\u0303i = h\u03a8\u0303N |\u03a8\u0303N i + h\u03a8\u0303\u2206 |\u03a8\u0303\u2206 i.\n\n(13)\n\nThese two terms correspond to different contributions. It can be shown that the piece\nh\u03a8\u0303N |\u03a8\u0303N i describes contributions due to final states with nucleons only. In this case the \u2206\ndegrees of freedom only contribute as virtual intermediate states. On the contrary the term\nh\u03a8\u0303\u2206 |\u03a8\u0303\u2206 i describes contributions from final states containing a real \u2206. The contribution to\nRT from this term vanishes below the threshold for \u2206 production. Since the present study is\nfor energies below that threshold this term will not contribute here to RT . Such a real \u2206 has\nto decay into a nucleon and a pion eventually, thus the contribution h\u03a8\u0303\u2206 |\u03a8\u0303\u2206 i corresponds\nto resonant pion production.\n\nIII.\nA.\n\nINPUT TO DYNAMICAL EQUATIONS\nPotentials\n\nIn the pure nucleonic sector we use the Argonne V18 (AV18) NN potential [20] and the\nUrbana IX (UIX) NNN potential [21] while for the pure NN\u2206 sector we take V N \u2206 =0 as\n5\n\n\fin the IA calculation of [12]. The NNN and NN\u2206 sectors are coupled via the V N N,N \u2206 and\nV N \u2206,N N potentials. We use the same form for this potential as described in [12] except\nthat here we use the short range cutoff given in the AV18 [20] potential. In detail we take\nV (NN \u2192 N\u2206) between particles 1 and 2 to have the form\n\u0015\n\u001a\u0014\n2aN N \u2032 \u03c1\nV0 (m\u03c1 ) \u03c3 1 *\u03c32\nV12 = aN N \u2032 \u03c0 \u03c4 1 *\u03c4 2 V0 (m\u03c0 ) +\naN N \u2032 \u03c0\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u001b\naN N \u2032 \u03c1\n+ V2 (m\u03c0 ) \u2212\nV2 (m\u03c1 ) S12\naN N \u2032 \u03c0\n\n(14)\n\nwith\n2\n\nV0 (m) = (mr)\u22121 e\u2212mr (1 \u2212 e\u2212cr ),\n\u0014\n\u0015 \u2212mr\n3\n3\ne\n2\nV2 (m) = 1 +\n+\n(1 \u2212 e\u2212cr )2 ,\n2\nmr (mr)\nmr\n\n(15)\n(16)\n\nwhere \u03c3 i (\u03c4 i ) are regarded as transition operators for spin (isospin) of particle i, the coupling\nconstants aN N \u2032 \u03c0 and aN N \u2032 \u03c1 are taken from [12], c = 2.1 fm\u22122 is the same value as in the\nAV18 potential, and r = |r1 \u2212 r2 | is proportional to the Jacobi vector \u03be1 (see Eq. (22)).\nB.\n\nElectromagnetic Currents\n\nIn Eqs. (10) and (11) the driving terms are the transverse electromagnetic currents acting\non the ground state. The term ON N represents the purely nucleonic one- and two-body\ncurrents. For these the same one-body and two-body currents as employed in [18] are used.\nThere the one-body currents included relativistic corrections to order M \u22123 and the two-body\ncurrents were consistent \u03c0- and \u03c1-MEC currents constructed using the method of Arenh\u00f6vel\nand Schwamb [22]. The other terms ON \u2206 , O\u2206N , and O\u2206\u2206 are transition and diagonal onebody \u2206-isobar currents. The currents involving the \u2206-resonance are given in Fig. 1. For\none-body \u2206-isobar currents we use the forms\n3\nX\n\ni(\u03c3k \u2206N \u00d7 q) \u2206N \u2206N\nGM 1 \u03c4zk ,\n2m\u2206\n\n(17)\n\n\u0015\n\u2206\ni(\u03c3k \u2206 \u00d7 q)\n1 + \u03c4zk\n2p\u2032k + \u03baq \u2206\n\u2206\nGE0 +\nGM 1\n,\n2m\u2206\n2m\u2206\n2\n\n(18)\n\nj\u2206N =\n\nk=1\n\n\u2032\n\neiq*rk\n\nand\nj\u2206\u2206 =\n\n3\nX\nk=1\n\niq*r\u2032k\n\ne\n\n\u0014\n\nwhere r\u2032k = rk \u2212 Rcm, and p\u2032k = pk \u2212 Pcm Ak /A are the relative coordinate and momentum\noperator of the k-th particle, while Rcm and Pcm are the center-of-mass coordinate and\n6\n\n\f(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFIG. 1: Operators involving the \u2206-resonance in the N N N (a) and N N \u2206 (b) channels\n\ninitial total momentum variables of the system.

(7), (11) and (12) for the ground state and Lorentz vectors we\nexpand the bound and Lorentz states on a complete antisymmetric basis. The reason for\nantisymmetrizing NN\u2206 states is that they couple to purely antisymmetric nucleonic states\nthrough symmetric operators. Thus the excitation of an antisymmetric NNN state to a NN\u2206\nstate occurs via an operator symmetric with respect to nucleons. Such an operator is a sum\nof operators which replace a nucleon with a \u2206 which therefore leads to an antisymmetric\nNN\u2206 state. For the NNN part we take the same correlated hyperspherical basis as in our\n7\n\n\fprevious three-body calculations without considering \u2206 degrees of freedom (see, e.g., [14]).\nFor the part with one \u2206-excitation we use the following hyperspherical basis\n1 + P 1 \u2212 (12)\n|\u03c6k i = \u221a p\n3\n2(1 + B 2 )\n\nhN K(Ll)L \u2297 ((s1 s2 ) Ss3 ) S\n\n\u0001\n\nJ MJ\n\n, ((t1 t2 ) T t3 ) T MT\n\nE\n\n,\n\n(20)\n\nwhere N is the order of the hyperradial function, K is the hyperspherical angular momentum, L and l are the orbital angular momentum of the pair and of the spectator,\nrespectively, coupled to the total orbital angular momentum L. Individual spin (isospin)\nquantum numbers of the three particles are denoted by si (ti ), i = 1, 2, 3 while the pair\nspin (isospin) is denoted by S (T ), the total spin (isospin) by S (T ) and MT stands\nfor the projection of the total isospin. Quantum numbers J and MJ denote the total\nangular momentum and its projection and (... \u2297 ...)J MJ denotes (LS)J coupling. The\nindex k denotes collectively {N, K, L, l, L, S, S, J , MJ , T, T , MT } and B. We define the\nquantity B to be 0 if the pair of the three particle system contains one \u2206 and therefore\n(s1 , s2 , s3 ) = (t1 , t2 , t3 ) = (1/2, 3/2, 1/2), and to be 1 if the pair contains no \u2206 and therefore\n(s1 , s2 , s3 ) = (t1 , t2 , t3 ) = (1/2, 1/2, 3/2). Note that if particles 1 and 2 are nucleons we\nalways assume that L+S+T=odd so that the NN pair is already antisymmetric. The spatial basis functions in coordinate representation are products of hyperradial functions and\nhyperspherical harmonics\nLl\nh\u03be1 \u03be2 |hN K(Ll)LML i = RN (\u03c1)YKLM\n(x, x1 , \u03c61 , x2 , \u03c62 ),\nL\n\nThe coordinates \u03c1 and x are defined in terms of the Jacobi vectors\ns\nr\n\u0012\n\u0013\nA1 r1 + A2 r2\nA1 A2\n(A1 + A2 )A3\n\u03be1 =\nr3 \u2212\n(r2 \u2212 r1 ) , \u03be2 =\nA1 + A2\nA1 + A2 + A3\nA1 + A2\n\n(21)\n\n(22)\n\nas \u03c1 = (\u03be12 + \u03be22 )1/2 , x = (\u03be22 \u2212 \u03be12 )/\u03c1. The coordinates xi \u2261 cos \u03b8i and \u03c6i are spherical coordinates of the unit vectors in the directions of \u03be 1 and \u03be 2 . We use the notation\nAi \u2261 mi /mN . Note that particle permutations entering the antisymmetrization operator\ninterchange not only particle position vectors ri but also their mass numbers Ai . One has\n\u03c12 = \u03be12 + \u03be22 = A1 r12 + A2 r22 + A3 r32 \u2212 AR2 , where R is the center-of-mass position. Thus \u03c1\nremains invariant under particle permutations.\nThe operator (1 \u2212 (12)) / [2(1 + B 2 )]\n\n1/2\n\nmakes the (12)-pair explicitly antisymmetric.\n\nNote that it gives unity if the pair contains no \u2206 but rather is an antisymmetric NN pair.\n8\n\n\f\u221a\nFinally the operator (1 + P )/ 3, where P \u2261 (123) + (132), makes the three particle states\nwith antisymmetric (12) pair totally antisymmetric. It turns out to be convenient to keep\nboth B = 0 and B = 1 in (20) (thereby resulting in an overcomplete basis) and to finally select out numerically the linearly independent states. This enables one to select out\nthose states which give negligible contributions to the results. Application of the operator\n\u221a\n(1 + P )/ 3 in (20) results in the more practical form\nE\n1 \u2212 (12)\n\u2032 \u2032\n\u2032 \u2032\n\u2032 \u2032\n\u2032 \u2032\np\n|\u03c6k i =\n(FjL \u2297 ((s1 s2 ) S s3 ) S)J MJ , ((t1 t2 ) T t3 ) T MT ,\n2(1 + B \u2032 2 )\nB\u2032 S \u2032 T \u2032\nX\n\n(23)\n\nwhere j denotes collectively {B \u2032 S \u2032 T \u2032 , BSST T NK(Ll)} and\n|FjLML i\n\n1 \u0010\n= \u221a \u03b4B\u2032 ,B \u03b4S \u2032 ,S \u03b4T \u2032 ,T hN K(Ll)LML\n3\n\n+gBc \u2032 S \u2032 T \u2032 ,BSST T hcN K(Ll)LML + gBd \u2032 S \u2032 T \u2032 ,BSST T hdN K(Ll)LML\n\n\u0011\n\n(24)\n\nwith (Ll)L coupling for the total orbital angular momentum L and its projection ML . As\nmentioned above components with B \u2032 =1 in Eq. (23) represent configurations NN\u2206 in which\n\nparticles 1 and 2 are nucleons. Those components with B \u2032 =0 represent N\u2206N configurations\nin which particle 1 is a nucleon and particle 2 is a \u2206. More details of the spin-isospin\nfactors g c and g d, and the spatial functions hc and hd are given in Appendix A. Techniques\nemployed in calculating the kinetic energy and the NN \u2192 N\u2206 or N\u2206 \u2192 NN potential are\ngiven in Appendices B and C respectively.\nAs in [6] all currents are expressed in terms of multipole expansions. Explicit expressions\nfor the multipoles of the one-body current (containing relativistic corrections) are given\nin [18]. The multipoles for the \u03c0- and \u03c1-MEC are found in [6] with modifications due to\nthe implementation of consistent MECs for the AV18 potential listed in [7]. Finally the\nmultipoles required here for the one-body currents relating to the \u2206 are listed in Appendix\nD. With these multipoles one can then decompose the LIT of the response function according\nto its multipole content as\nR \u0303T (\u03c3) =\n\nX X\n4\u03c0\n(2J + 1)(R \u0303T )j\u03bb\nJ ,\n2J0 + 1 \u03bb=el,mag J j\n\n(25)\n\nwhere\nj\u03bb\nj\u03bb\nN j\u03bb\nN j\u03bb\n\u2206j\u03bb\n\u2206j\u03bb\n(R \u0303T )j\u03bb\nJ = h\u03a8\u0303J M |\u03a8\u0303J M i = h\u03a8\u0303J M |\u03a8\u0303J M i + h\u03a8\u0303J M |\u03a8\u0303J M i.\n\n9\n\n(26)\n\n\fHere J0 is the initial state total angular momentum, J and M are the final state total\nangular momentum and its projection. The |\u03a8\u0303j\u03bb\nJ i are the solutions of (11,12) where the\nfollowing replacement is made on the rhs of these equations\nO|\u03a80i \u2192 |qJj\u03bbM i = [Tj\u03bb \u2297 |\u03a80 (J0 )i]J M .\n\n(27)\n\n\u2206\nIn Eq. (26) M is arbitrary. In Eq. (27) above \u03a80 is either \u03a8N\n0 or \u03a80 , while O represents\n\nthe various electromagnetic current operators on the rhs of (10,11). By projecting the rhs\nof (27) on the basis states (23) one obtains\n(Fj \u2032L\u2032 \u2297 ((s\u20321 s\u20322 ) S \u2032 s\u20323 ) S \u2032 )J \u2032 M\u2032 qJj\u03bbM i = \u03b4J \u2032 ,J \u03b4M\u2032 ,M\n\n(Fj \u2032 L\u2032 \u2297 ((s\u20321 s\u20322 ) S \u2032 s\u20323 ) S \u2032 )J \u2032 Tj\u03bb k\u03a80 (J0 )i\n.\nJ\u02c6 \u2032\n(28)\n\nWe use the Lanczos method to calculate the response function, as described in [23].

As\nstarting vector |\u03c60 i we choose the rhs of (12) at one particular value of \u03c3. The expression\n\nh\u03c6m |(E0 + \u03c3 \u2212 HN )\u22121 |\u03c6n i can be calculated by using Eq. (71) of [23]. A difference from\nprevious LIT applications appears in the potential term on the rhs of the LIT equation,\nnamely the N\u2206 transition potential V N N,N \u2206 in (12).

Also the second term in Eq.

We found sufficient accuracy by restricting the\nmaximum value of J to 5/2. The LIT is computed with \u03c3I = 5 MeV. The LIT inversion\n10\n\n\f[24] is made with our standard inversion method [14, 25]. As discussed in [6] we subtract\nfrom the LIT of the M1 transition the elastic contribution and invert the remaining inelastic\npiece separately from the other multipole contributions.\n\nIV.\n\nRESULTS\n\nIn the present work we have used the LIT method to calculate \u2206-IC effects on the\ntransverse electron scattering response function RT (q, \u03c9) for q\u2248900 MeV/c and \u03c9 up to\n20 MeV above the breakup threshold. This is the first application of the LIT method to\ninclude \u2206 degrees of freedom in the calculation of inclusive (e,e') response functions. The\nimportance of \u2206-effects at these kinematics has previously been shown by [5]. As NN\nand NNN interactions we used the AV18 and the UIX potentials respectively. Following\nthe IA calculation of [12] we do not consider a diagonal N\u2206 interaction, i.e. VN \u2206 = 0.\nFor the 3 He ground state, our interaction model leads to a \u2206-probability of 1.14 % which\ncompares to 1.44% obtained by [5] who used a CDBonn+\u2206 coupled channel potential model\n[26]. In addition to the \u2206-ICs jN \u2206 , j\u2206N and j\u2206\u2206 the purely nucleonic currents include the\nnonrelativistic one-body current with relativistic corrections up to order M \u22123 [18] and an\nMEC consistent with the AV18 potential [7]. Concerning the relativistic corrections we leave\nout the \u03c9 dependent relativistic piece in the present work as its contribution is negligible in\nthe threshold region we consider. For the neutron magnetic and the proton form factors we\ntake the dipole fit while the neutron electric form factor is taken from [27].\nFig. 2 displays our RT results for several calculational options. The dominant transition\nmultipolarity contributing at these near threshold energies is M1. One sees that relativistic\neffects reduce the M1 transition strength considerably. If in addition MEC are also taken into\naccount then the M1 contribution drops markedly leading to a rather different low-energy\nbehavior of RT . Inclusion of \u2206-IC restores some of this lost strength and demonstrates, as\nanticipated, that the \u2206 effect is quite large.\nNow we turn to a comparison of our results with those of [5]. For the comparison one\nshould keep in mind that there are differences between the two calculations. Thus in [5], (i)\nrelativistic currents have not been considered, (ii) the Coulomb force is neglected in the final\nstate interaction, (iii) their nucleonic potential model, the CDBonn [28], is different from ours\nand does not reproduce the 3 He binding energy and (iv) the full coupled channel calculation,\n11\n\n\f2\n\n-1\n\nNR 1b\nREL 1b\nREL 1b+2b\nREL 1b+2b+Delta\n\n3\n\n-6\n\nRT [ 10 MeV ]\n\n4\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n1.5\n\nq=862 MeV/c\n\n0\n5\n\n10\n15\n\u03c9int [MeV]\n\n20\n\nq=927 MeV/c\n\n0\n5\n\n10\n15\n\u03c9int [MeV]\n\n20\n\nFIG. 2: Theoretical results for RT of 3 He as function of internal excitation energy \u03c9int at q=862\nand 927 MeV/c with various current operators: non-relativistic nucleon one-body (dotted), with\nadditional relativistic corrections (dashed), plus additional MEC (dash-dotted), further addition\nof \u2206-IC (solid).\n\nCDBonn+\u2206 [26], is a more consistent treatment of \u2206 degrees of freedom than the IA, but\nleads to a slight underestimation of the 3 He binding energy. There is another point which\nmakes the comparison a bit more difficult. Namely, the RT of [5] is not calculated for a\nconstant momentum transfer, in fact q is slightly decreasing with growing energy. Therefore,\nin Fig. 3, we prefer to display the results for each q in two panels. One sees that despite\nthe various differences mentioned above the \u2206-effects in both calculations are very similar.\nHowever, one also notes that relativistic corrections lead to an opposite effect, which is of\nthe same size at q = 862 MeV/c, but somewhat weaker at q = 927 MeV/c. By comparison\nof results for RT at about q = 500 MeV/c from [7] against those of [5] one finds again an at\nleast partial cancellation of relativistic and \u2206 contributions close to the breakup threshold.\nThe stronger increase of RT in the calculation of [5] at higher energies, seen in Fig. 3, partly\noriginates from the non-constant momentum transfers used in [5] as mentioned above (see\nalso discussion of Fig. 4).\nFinally in Fig. 4 we compare the results of our calculation with experimental data [29].\nAgain, as in the calculation of [5] the momentum transfer is only quasi-constant.

[5] with non-relativistic nucleon one-body current and MEC (dotted)\nand additional \u2206-contributions (dash-dotted).\n\nin the left panel we show RT including all current contributions for the two extreme q values,\ni.e. q = 862 and 850 MeV/c, and in addition for q = 862 MeV/c the result where only \u2206-IC\nare left out. The lower q corresponds to the data at about \u03c9int = 20 MeV, while the higher q\ncorresponds to the threshold energy. In the right panel of the figure we only show the results\nfor q = 927 MeV/c that corresponds to the data close to threshold. The \u2206-IC contribution\nis seen to be essential for obtaining a good agreement between theory and experiment below\n10 MeV. However, at higher energies the increase due to \u2206-IC is not sufficient to describe\nthe data even if one considers the slight shift of q with higher energies represented by the\ndotted curve. The present case is rather similar to deuteron electrodisintegration at higher\nmomentum transfer, where at low excitation energy the leading M1 transition also has a\nminimum. For the deuteron case it is known (see e.g. [31]) that various theoretical ingredients, like for example the potential model dependence, can lead to rather large variations\nof the theoretical result. Thus our present study cannot give a final answer concerning the\n13\n\n\fcomparison of theory and experiment.\n\n3\n5\n-1\n\n3\n\nRT [ 10 MeV ]\n\n4\n\n-6\n\n2.5\n2\n1.5\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n5\n\n10\n15\n\u03c9int [MeV]\n\n0\n20 5\n\n10\n15\n\u03c9int [MeV]\n\n20\n\nFIG. 4: RT of 3 He for same kinematics and the same dash-dotted and solid curves as in Fig. 2;\nin addition: result with all current contributions at q = 850 MeV/c (dash-double dotted curve).\nExperimental data with slightly varying q-values from [29].\n\nWe summarize our work as follows. We have illustrated how \u2206 degrees of freedom\nare integrated into the LIT formalism for a calculation of the inelastic inclusive transverse (e, e\u2032 ) response function RT of 3 He. The resulting coupled equations for the Lorentz\nstates of the NNN and NN\u2206 channels contain, as opposed to the corresponding coupled\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation, source terms with electromagnetic operators acting on the nuclear\nground state. The \u2206 degrees of freedom are present in three different forms: (i) in the\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\npotentials V N1 N2 ,N1 N2 , (ii) in the \u2206-propagator, and (iii) in the current operators jN1\u2032 N1 . The\ncoupled channel equation is solved in impulse approximation, where the NNN and NN\u2206\nchannels are treated separately. First, the NNN part is solved using a realistic nuclear\ninteraction with NN and NNN potentials. The result thus obtained is then used for the\nsolution of the NN\u2206 channel. The former gives a contribution to the electrodisintegration of a purely nucleonic final state, whereas the latter leads to a contribution to the pion\nproduction channel. In the present work we have studied \u2206-effects in RT of 3 He close to\nthe breakup threshold at an momentum transfers of about 900 MeV/c. The response function is affected by sizable MEC contributions, and, as in a previous full coupled channel\n14\n\n\fcalculation [5] we find a considerable increase of RT due to \u2206 degrees of freedom. Unlike\nthe calculation of [5] we here take into account relativistic corrections to the nonrelativistic\none-body current operator. At the kinematics considered here these relativistic corrections\nnearly cancel the \u2206-IC contribution. This cancellation in fact leads to good agreement of our\ntheoretical RT with experimental data at very low energy transfer, while the experimental\nRT is underestimated at somewhat higher energies.\n\nV.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\n\nAcknowledgments of financial support are given to AuroraScience (L.P.Y.), to the RFBR,\ngrant 10-02-00718 and RMES, grant NS-7235.2010.2 (V.D.E.), and to the National Science\nand Engineering Research Council of Canada (E.L.T.).\n\nAppendix A: Details of gc , hc , gd , hd\n\nThe spin-isospin factors are\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\u221a1 fB \u2032 S \u2032 T \u2032 ,BSST T\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n2\n\uf8f2\nS+T\nc\nfB\u2032 S \u2032 T \u2032 ,BSST T\ngB\u2032 S \u2032 T \u2032 ,BSST T = \u2212(\u2212)\ns1 \u2194s2 ,t1 \u2194t2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n0\n\nif B \u2032 = 1 and B = 0,\nif B \u2032 = 0 and B = 0,\notherwise.\n\n\uf8f1\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u2212(\u22121)S +T \u221a12 fB\u2032 S \u2032 T \u2032 ,BSST T \u2032 \u2032 \u2032 \u2032\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\ns1 \u2194s2 ,t1 \u2194t2\n\uf8f2\n\u2032 +T \u2032 \u221a\nd\nS\ngB\u2032 S \u2032 T \u2032 ,BSST T =\n\u2212(\u2212)\n2fB\u2032 S \u2032 T \u2032 ,BSST T \u2032 \u2032 \u2032 \u2032\n\uf8f4\ns1 \u2194s2 ,t1 \u2194t2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n0\n\u001a \u2032 \u2032 \u2032\u001b\u001a \u2032 \u2032\nt1 t2\ns1 s2 S\nS+T \u2032 \u02c6\u2032\nfB\u2032 S \u2032 T \u2032 ,BSST T = (\u2212)\n\u015c \u015c T T\u0302\n\u2032\nt\u20323 T\ns3 S S\n\nThe spatial functions in coordinate representation are\n\n(A1)\n\nif B \u2032 = 1 and B = 0,\nif B \u2032 = 0 and B = 1,\notherwise.\n\u001b\nT\u2032\n\u03b4s\u20321 s3 \u03b4s\u20322 s1 \u03b4s\u20323 s2 .\nT\n\n(A2)\n\n(A3)\n\nh\u03be 1 \u03be 2 |hcN K(Ll)LML i = (\u2212)L h\u03be\u20321 (\u03be1 , \u03be2 )\u03be \u20322 (\u03be 1 , \u03be 2 )|hN K(Ll)LML i,\n\n(A4)\n\nh\u03be 1 \u03be 2 |hdN K(Ll)LML i = h\u03be\u20321 (\u2212\u03be 1 , \u03be2 )\u03be\u20322 (\u2212\u03be 1 , \u03be 2 )|hN K(Ll)LML i,\n\n(A5)\n\nwhere \u03be \u20321 (\u03be1 , \u03be2 ) and \u03be\u20322 (\u03be1 , \u03be2 ) are connected to \u03be 1 and \u03be 2 through the cycle operator (123)\nby hr\u20321 r\u20322 r\u20323 s\u20321 s\u20322 s\u20323 t\u20321 t\u20322 t\u20323 | = hr2 r3 r1 s2 s3 s1 t2 t3 t1 |, and using (22) we have\n15\n\n\fs\ns\n\n\u03be \u20321 (\u03be 1 , \u03be 2 ) = \u2212\n\n\u03be \u20322 (\u03be 1 , \u03be 2 ) = \u2212\n\nA3 A1\n\u03be +\n(A2 + A3 )(A1 + A2 ) 1\n\ns\n\nA2 (A1 + A2 + A3 )\n\u03be ,\n(A2 + A3 )(A1 + A2 ) 2\n\n(A1 + A2 + A3 )A2\n\u03be \u2212\n(A2 + A3 )(A1 + A2 ) 1\n\ns\n\nA1 A3\n\u03be .\n(A2 + A3 )(A1 + A2 ) 2\n\n(A6)\n\nAppendix B: Kinetic Energy Calculational Details\n\nFor a basis of antisymmetric states the kinetic energy can be written as\nT =\n\n3\nA1 + A2\n\u03c02,\n2mN A1 + A2 + A3 1\n\nwhere \u03c0 1 = \u2212i\u2202/\u2202\u03be 1 is the Jacobi momentum conjugate to \u03be1 .\n\n(B1)\nNoting that for\n\ncalculating the matrix elements of \u03c0 21 between the basis states (23) one may drop\n(1 \u2212 (12)) / [2(1 + B \u2032\u20322 )]\nh\u03c6k\u2032 |T |\u03c6k i =\n\n1/2\n\n, we get\n\nX\nA\"1 + A\"2\n3\n\u03b4L\u2032 ,L \u03b4S \u2032 ,S \u03b4J \u2032 ,J \u03b4MJ \u2032 ,MJ \u03b4T \u2032 ,T \u03b4MT \u2032 ,MT\n2mN\nA\"1 + A\"2 + A\"3\nB\"S\"T \"\n\n\u00d7hFB\"S\"T \",B\u2032 S \u2032 ST \u2032T N \u2032 K \u2032 (L\u2032 l\u2032 )LML |\u03c0 21 |FB\"S\"T \",BSST T N K(Ll)LML i.\n\n(B2)\n\nFor the calculation of the spatial matrix elements we use the technique as described in [30]\nto get\n\u03b4L\u2032 ,L \u03b4ML\u2032 ,ML 8\u03c0 2\n2\n\u2032\n\u2032\nhFj L ML\u2032 |\u03c0 1 |FjLML i =\n2L + 1\n\nZ\n\n(\n\u0015\u0014\n\u0015\nX\u0014 \u2202\n\u2202\nd\u03c4int\nFj \u2032 LM\"\nFjLM\"\n\u2202\u03be\n\u2202\u03be1\n1\nM\"\n)\nX\nl\u03bc Fj \u2032 LM\" l\u03bc FjLM\" , (B3)\n+\u03be1\u22122\nM\",\u03bc=\u00b1\n\nwhere d\u03c4int = \u03be12 \u03be22 d\u03be1d\u03be2 dt, t = \u03be\u02c61 * \u03be\u02c62 .
