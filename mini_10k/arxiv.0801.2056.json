The potential is produced by a relatively simple laser configuration for atoms\nwith a tripod level scheme. We show that the atomic motion is described by two different dispersion\nbranches with positive or negative chirality. As a consequence, atom reflection shows unusual\nfeatures, since an incident wave may split into two reflected ones at a barrier, an ordinary specular\nreflection, and an additional non-specular one. Remarkably, the latter wave can exhibit negative\nreflection and may become evanescent if the angle of incidence exceeds a critical value. These\nreflection properties are crucial for future designs in non-Abelian atom optics.\nPACS numbers: 03.75.-b, 42.50.Gy, 42.25.Bs\n\nIntroduction Atomic mirrors, created by optical [1]\nor magnetic [2] potential barriers, play a crucial role in\natom optics enabling to manipulate matter waves. Wave\nreflection at a mirror is typically specular, where the reflection angle equals the incidence one. However, richer\nreflection scenarios are also possible. For optical waves a\ndouble reflection appears in optically active media, such\nas in chiral liquids characterized by different refractive\nindices for left and right polarized light [3]. This manifests itself as a tiny splitting of the reflected wave into\ntwo parts [4]. An additional striking example is Andreev\nreflection [5, 6] in which an electron incident at the interface between a normal metal and a superconductor is\nreflected to a positively charged hole propagating backwards, where the missing charge of 2e enters the superconductor as a Cooper pair.\nArtificial electromagnetism for cold neutral atoms is\nattracting a growing attention. A proper manipulation\nof atoms in optical lattices may allow for the observation\nof Hofstadter butterfly energy spectra [7] and paradoxical geometries [8], as well as for the generation of nonAbelian gauge potentials [9]. Alternatively, Abelian and\nnon-Abelian gauge potentials may be induced by means\nof laser fields acting on atoms in, respectively, lambda\n[10] and tripod [11, 12, 13] schemes of electronic levels.\nNon-Abelian gauge potentials lead to a number of distinctive properties, e.g. modification of the metal-insulator\ntransition [14] or non-Abelian Aharanov-Bohm interferometric effects [9, 15]. Recently, it was shown [16] that a\ntripod-scheme provides quasi-relativistic physics for cold\natoms, similar to that for electrons in graphene [17].\nIn this Letter we analyze atom reflection in the presence of a non-Abelian vector potential proportional to a\nspin-1/2 operator produced by a relatively simple laser\narrangement for tripod-scheme atoms. We show that the\nappearance of two different dispersion branches with pos-\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) Three light fields acting on atom in a\ntripod configuration of energy levels involved.\n\nitive or negative chirality leads to a double reflection at\nthe mirror, an ordinary specular reflection, and an additional non-specular one. Remarkably, the latter can\nexhibit a negative reflection, resembling the Andreev reflection [5, 6]. The negatively reflected wave becomes\nevanescent if the angle of incidence exceeds a critical\nvalue. These reflection properties could become crucial\nfor the design of future non-Abelian atom optics devices,\nas e.g. non-Abelian atom interferometers [9, 15].\nAdiabatic motion of tripod atoms In the following we\nconsider an atom with a tripod electronic level scheme\n{|0i, |1i, |2i, |3i} (see Fig. 1a) under the influence of three\nstationary laser beams [11, 16, 18, 19]. The j-th laser\ninduces a resonant atomic transition (with a Rabi frequency \u03a9j ) between |ji and |0i. These can be for instance the transition 23 S1 \u2194 23 P0 in 4 He\u2217 or the transition 5S1/2 (F = 1) \u2194 5P3/2 (F = 0) in 87 Rb.\nThe electronic Hamiltonian of the tripod system reads\nin the interaction representation [11]\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u01240 = \u2212~|0i \u03a91 h1| + \u03a92 h2| + \u03a93 h3| + H.c. . (1)\nThus |0i is coupled only to the bright state |Bi = (\u03a9\u22171 |1i+\n\u03a9\u22172 |2i + \u03a9\u22173 |3i)/\u03a9, where \u03a9 = (|\u03a91 |2 + |\u03a92 |2 + |\u03a93 |2 )1/2\n\n\f2\n\nH=\n\n1\n(\u2212i~\u2207 \u2212 A)2 + V + \u03a6 ,\n2M\n\n(2)\n\nwhere M is the atomic mass. The gauge potentials\nA and \u03a6 emerge due to the spatial dependence of\nthe dark states. The 2 \u00d7 2 matrix A with the elements Anm = i~hDn (r)|\u2207Dm (r)i represents the effective vector potential known as the Mead-Berry connection [11, 16, 19, 20, 21, 22]. The 2 \u00d7 2 matrix \u03a6 with\nelements \u03a6nm = (~2 /2M )hDn (r)|\u2207B(r)ihB(r)|\u2207Dm (r)i\nacts as an effective scalar potential. Finally, the 2 \u00d7 2\nmatrix V with elements Vnm = hDn (r)|V\u0302 |Dm (r)i is\nan external\npotential for the dark-state atoms. Here\nP3\nV\u0302 = j=1 Vj (r)|jihj|, with Vj (r) being the trapping potential for an atom in the j-the internal state. Note that\nthe potential Vj can also accommodate a detuning of the\nj-th laser from the resonance of the j \u2192 0 transition.\nLaser arrangement Although elaborate laser configurations may allow for a wealth of possible gauge potentials in the tripod scheme [11], here we concentrate\non a relatively simple laser setup providing non Abelian\npotentials. The first two laser beams are assumed to\ncounterpropagate with the\n\u221a same intensity along the\u221axaxis, \u03a91 = \u03a9 sin \u03b8e\u2212i\u03ba0 x / 2 and \u03a92 = \u03a9 sin \u03b8ei\u03ba0 x / 2,\nand the third one propagating in the z-direction [16],\n\u03a93 = \u03a9 cos \u03b8ei\u03ba0 z . Here \u03ba0 is the wave-number, and the\nmixing angle \u03b8 characterizes the relative intensity of the\nthird laser. A set of two dark states is then given by\n\u0001\n\u2032\n(3)\n|D1 i = 2\u22121/2 |1\u0303i \u2212 |2\u0303i e\u2212i\u03ba z ,\ni\nh\n\u0001\n\u2032\n|D2 i = 2\u22121/2 cos \u03b8 |1\u0303i + |2\u0303i \u2212 sin \u03b8|3i e\u2212i\u03ba z , (4)\nwith \u03ba\u2032 = \u03ba0 (1 \u2212 cos \u03b8), where the modified atomic\nstate-vectors |1\u0303i = |1i exp[i\u03ba0 (x + z)] and |2\u0303i =\n|2i exp[\u2212i\u03ba0 (x \u2212 z)] accommodate the phases of the laser\nfields. An additional phase factor exp(i\u03ba\u2032 z) introduces a\nshift in the origin \u221a\nof the momentum k \u2192 k + \u03ba\u2032 ez . By\nimposing cos \u03b8 = 2 \u2212 1, the vector potential becomes\n\n2.5\n\n2\n\n1.5\n\u03c9/\u03c90\n\nis the total Rabi frequency. The two states |Bi\u221aand |0i\nsplit into a dressed doublet |\u00b1i = (|Bi \u00b1 |0i)/ 2 with\nenergies \u00b1~\u03a9. The remaining two eigenstates |Dj i (j =\n1 , 2), known as dark states, are orthogonal to |Bi and\nhence are decoupled from the light fields, \u01240 |Dj i = 0.\nWe assume that the light fields are sufficiently strong,\nso that \u03a9 is large compared to the two-photon detuning\ndue to the laser mismatch and/or Doppler shift. The\ndark states are thus well separated in energies from the\ndoublet |\u00b1i, and the internal atomic state evolves within\nthe dark state manifold. The full atomic state-vector |\u03a6i\ncan then be expanded in terms of the dark states, |\u03a6i =\nP2\nj=1 \u03a8j (r)|Dj (r)i, where \u03a8j (r) is a wave-function for\nthe center of mass motion of an atom in the j-th dark\nstate. The two-component spinor-like wavefunction \u03a8 =\n{\u03a81 , \u03a82 }T obeys the Schr\u00f6dinger equation i~\u2202\u03a8/\u2202t =\nH\u03a8, with the center of mass Hamiltonian [11]\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\nk/\u03ba\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) Upper (blue dashed) and lower (red\nsolid) dispersion branch for tripod atoms in light fields.\n\nA = \u2212~\u03ba\u03c3\u22a5 , where \u03c3\u22a5 = ex \u03c3x + ez \u03c3z is the operator\nof spin 1/2 in the xz plane, and \u03ba = \u03ba0 cos \u03b8 \u2248 0.414\u03ba0.\nThe Cartesian components Ax and Az are proportional\nto the Pauli matrices \u03c3x and \u03c3z which do not commute,\nso the vector potential A is non-Abelian. Note that similar non-Abelian gauge potentials can also be induced by\nmeans of standing waves in a tripod setup [12, 13] or by\nstate selective tunneling in optical lattices [9].\nFurthermore we take the trapping potentials V1 = V2\nand V3 \u2212 V1 = ~\u03ba20 sin2 \u03b8/2M . This can be achieved by\ndetuning properly the third laser from the two-photon\nresonance. Hence the overall trapping potential V +\u03a6 becomes proportional to the unit matrix, both dark states\nbeing affected by the same potential V1 \u2261 V1 (r), giving\nH=\n\n1\n(\u2212i~\u2207 + ~\u03ba\u03c3\u22a5 )2 + V1 (r) .\n2M\n\n(5)\n\nDispersion law We shall consider a two dimensional\ncase where the atomic motion is confined to the xz plane.\nIf the trapping potential V1 is constant, the eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian (5) are the plane waves\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 1 \u2213 iei\u03c6k\n\u00b1 ik*r\n\u00b1\n,\n(6)\n\u03a8\u00b1\n(r)\n=\ng\ne\n,\ng\n=\nk\nk\nk\n2 \u2212i \u00b1 ei\u03c6k\nwhere \u03c6k is the angle between the atomic wave-vector\nk and the x-axis.

For larger wave-numbers\neach k = k1 < 2\u03ba has a counterpart, k2 = 2\u03ba \u2212 k, characterized by the same eigen-frequency ~\u03c9k\u22122 = ~\u03c9k\u22121 and\nopposite slope in the lower dispersion branch [23]. As\nshown below, this leads to unusual reflection properties.\nDouble and negative reflection of atoms To prepare\nan incident atom in the lower dispersion branch we suggest the following procedure. Initially the first two lasers\nare on, the third laser is off, and the atom is in the\ninternal state |3i coinciding (up to a phase) with the\nsecond dark state, |D2 i = |3i exp(\u2212i\u03ba\u2032 z). The atomic\ncenter of mass motion is initially characterized by a\nwave-vector kin = kin ez [24], giving the full state vector\n|\u03a6i = |D2 i exp(ikz), where k = kin + \u03ba\u2032 . Subsequently\nthe laser 3 is switched on slowly, so that the atom remains in the dark state |D2 i. Yet the duration of the\nswitching-on should be short enough to avoid any substantial atomic motion at this stage. Since k = kez , the\nspinor gk\u2212 represents the dark state |D2 i. Hence one arrives at the atomic state-vector |\u03a6i corresponding to the\nnegative-chirality solution \u03a8\u2212\nk , as required. The atoms\nprepared in this way will propagate along the z axis for\nk > \u03ba or opposite to it for k < \u03ba.\nThe atoms are impinging on an infinitely high potential\nbarrier at an angle of incidence \u03b1. We shall take k < 2\u03ba,\n\u2212\nso that both reflected waves \u03a8\u2212\nk1 and \u03a8k2 remain in the\nlower dispersion branch with wave-numbers k1 = k and\nk2 = 2\u03ba \u2212 k. Fig. 3b shows the case of an incident wave\nwith \u03ba < k < 2\u03ba. Here the group velocity vk\u2212 = \u2202\u03c9k\u2212 /\u2202k\nis positive, so the wave-vectors of the incident and second\nreflected waves point inwards to the surface, whereas the\nwave-vector of the first reflected wave points outwards\nfrom the surface. Since vk\u2212 = vk\u22121 = \u2212vk\u22122 , this ensures the\nforward propagation of the incident wave and backward\npropagation of the reflected ones. Fig. 3a illustrates a\nsituation where 0 < k < \u03ba. Here the group velocity vk\u2212\nis negative and hence the wave-vectors are reversed.\n\nFIG. 4: (Color online) Reflection probabilities P1 and P2 for\nk/\u03ba = 0.5 and k/\u03ba = 1.1.\n\nIn front of the barrier the solution to the stationary\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation (H \u2212 ~\u03c9k\u2212 )\u03a8 = 0 is a linear superposition of the incident wave and two reflected waves:\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u03a8 = \u03a8\u2212\nk + r1 \u03a8k1 + r2 \u03a8k2 .\n\n(8)\n\nThe wave-vector is conserved along the reflection plane,\nkk = k1k = k2k , so the first wave exhibits an ordinary\nreflection with the reflection angle equal to the angle of\nincidence, \u03b11 = \u03b1. The second wave is characterized\nby the opposite group velocity vk\u22122 = \u2212vk\u2212 = \u2212vk\u22121 , and\nhence it experiences a negative reflection at an angle\n\u03b12 = arcsin[sin(\u03b1)k/k2 ] .\n\n(9)\n\nThe reflection coefficients r1 and r2 are determined using\nEqs. (6) and (8) together with the boundary condition at\nthe potential barrier \u03a8|barrier = 0, giving\nr1 =\n\nei\u03b1 \u2212 ei\u03b12\n,\ne\u2212i\u03b1 + ei\u03b12\n\nr2 = \u22121 \u2212 r1 .\n\n(10)\n\nThe corresponding reflection probabilities are\nP1 = |r1 |2 ,\n\nP2 =\n\ncos \u03b12\n|r2 |2 ,\ncos \u03b1\n\n(11)\n\nwith P1 + P2 = 1, where the weight factor cos \u03b12 / cos \u03b1\nappears when calculating the flow of atoms in and out\nof the surface for the incident and reflected waves. The\nprobabilities P1 and P2 plotted in Figure 4 are seen to\ndepend both on the angle of incidence \u03b1 and also on\nthe wave-number k. For small angles, \u03b1 \u226a 1, there is\npredominantly a negative reflection to the second branch,\n|P1 | \u226a 1 and |P2 | \u2248 1. For large angles of incidence\n(\u03b1 \u2192 \u03c0/2) and 0 < k < \u03ba we have mostly a specular\nreflection to the first branch, |P2 | \u226a 1 and |P1 | \u2248 1.\nIf \u03ba < k < 2\u03ba, the situation is more complex. In this\ncase the second reflected wave becomes evanescent when\nthe angle of incidence \u03b1 exceeds a critical value given by\n\n\f4\nsufficiently large incident angles. Atom mirrors are a key\ntool in atom optics. Hence the anomalous reflection properties may be of crucial importance for the design of non\nAbelian atom optics elements, e.g. atom interferometers\nwhich exploit the non-Abelian Aharanov-Bohm effect.\nThis work was supported by the Royal Society of\nEdinburgh, the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences\nResearch Council, the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft\n(SFB407, SPP1116), and the European Graduate College\non Interference and Quantum Applications.\nFIG. 5: (Color online) Reflection of an atomic wave-packet\nwith a negative chirality for \u03b1 = 15\u25e6 , k = 1.5\u03ba (left) and \u03b1 =\n65\u25e6 , k = 0.5\u03ba (right). The incident wave-packet is taken to be\nGaussian with momentum width \u2206k = 0.1\u03ba. An additional\narrow indicates the incident direction.\n\nsin \u03b1crit = k2 /k, i.e. for kk = k2k > k2 . Consequently the\nout-of-plane projection of the wave-vector\nk2 becomes\nq\nimaginary, k2\u22a5 = \u2212iq, with q = kk2 \u2212 k22 . In the region\n\nwhere x < 0 we can once again use Eq. (8) in which \u03a8\u2212\nk2\nis now an evanescent wave. The boundary condition at\nthe potential barrier gives the reflection coefficient\np\np\nei\u03b1 kk + q \u2212 i kk \u2212 q\np\n,\n(12)\nr1 = \u2212i\u03b1 p\ne\nkk + q + i kk \u2212 q\n\nwith |r1 | = 1. Thus there is a total reflection to the\nfirst mode at an angle \u03b11 = \u03b1 accompanied by a phase\nshift, with the second reflected wave being evanescent.\nThe phenomenon resembles the total internal reflection\nof optical waves at an interface with an optically thinner\nmedium. In our situation, however, the evanescent wave\nis the reflected wave rather than the refracted one.\nOur plane-wave analysis may be easily extended to\nthe case of wavepacket reflection. Similar results may\nbe found if the momentum width of the wavepacket \u2206k\nis sufficiently small with respect to \u03ba. Fig. 5 displays\nthe double and negative reflection of atomic wavepackets from an atomic mirror, for an incident wavepacket\n\u03a8 (r) = gk\u0304\u2212 eik\u0304*r f (r), with f (r) a Gaussian, and k\u0304 the\ncentral wavenumber. The propagation direction and population of each of the reflected wave-packets are in good\nagreement with the analytical plane-wave results (9)(11). Similar results are also found for more realistic\nGaussian or evanescent atomic mirrors [1, 2], as long as\nthe potential barrier is sufficiently high compared to the\nincident kinetic energy. Lower barriers would lead to partial reflection, transmission and tunneling, whose physics\nwill be the subject of further investigations.\nSummarizing, the reflection of atoms under a nonAbelian gauge potential presents unusual features. In\nparticular, one can have a double reflection comprising a\nspecular and a non-specular one. Remarkably, the latter\nwave shows negative reflection due to the special properties of the dispersion law, and becomes evanescent for\n\n[1] V. Balykin et al, Phys. Rev.
