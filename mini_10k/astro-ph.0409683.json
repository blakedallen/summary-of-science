Introduction\nThe Mg ii h and k resonance lines as well as the Ca ii\nH and K lines have played and continue to play an important role in the understanding of physical conditions\nin the chromospheres of late-type stars. In particular the\nMg ii emission lines, which are formed at higher temperatures and greater heights than the Ca ii lines, are important tools for the diagnosis of chromospheric properties and, thanks to the large abundance of Magnesium,\nare good indicators of the total chromospheric radiative\nloss (Linsky & Ayres 1978). In addition, the photospheric\nbackground around the region of 2800 \u00c5 being small or\nnegligible compared to the chromospheric flux, the problem of photospheric background subtraction is considerably reduced with respect to Ca ii.\nFor all these reasons, Mg ii emission lines have\nbeen widely studied both in the Sun and in late-type\nstars (Basri & Linsky 1979; Cerruti-Sola et al. 1992;\n(Mathioudakis & Doyle 1992);\nElgar\u00f8y et al. 1997;\nBuchholz et al. 1998).\nThe presence of resonance emission lines in\nlate type stars is generally attributed to chromospheric temperature gradients generated by nonraSend offprint requests\ncardini@rm.iasf.cnr.it\n\nto:\n\nDaniela\n\nCardini,\n\ne-mail:\n\ndiative heating (Ayres 1979). Two different types\nof mechanisms have been identified as responsible\nfor chromospheric heating: hydrodinamic (acoustic\nand pulsational waves) and magnetic mechanisms\n(Narain & Ulmschneider 1996;\nBuchholz et al. 1998;\nUlmschneider et al. 2001; Fawzy et al. 2002a).\nThe heating by acoustic waves appears to be the\nbasic mechanism generating a basal flux strongly dependent on the colour of the star, but independent of\nluminosity class (Oranje & Zwaan 1985; Schrijver 1987;\nRutten et al. 1991).\nThe fact that stars with the same fundamental\nstellar parameters, like effective temperature, luminosity, and metallicity show a broad range of chromospheric activity is generally attributed to different fractions of the stellar surface covered by magnetic fields\n(Rutten et al. 1991; Baliunas et al. 1995). Indeed, highresolution observations of the Sun show considerable spatial variation in Mg ii fluxes which become larger in regions\nof higher magnetic activity.\nSeveral semiempirical and theoretical models of stellar\nchromospheres have been proposed (see Ayres 1979;\nUlmschneider et al. 2001;\nFawzy et al. 2002a).\nTheoretically predicted basal emission fluxes are in\ngood agreement with minimal observed emission fluxes.\nOn the other hand, the modeling of magnetic surface\n\n\f2\n\nD. Cardini: Mg ii emission fluxes in late type stars.\n\nstructure, which is responsible for the excess flux, roughly\naccounts for the observed line emission fluxes in Ca ii,\nbut does not explain the large emission fluxes in Mg ii\n(Buchholz et al. 1998; Fawzy et al. 2002b).\nTo test our understanding of the generation, propagation and dissipation of both mechanical and magnetical\nenergy fluxes, it is useful to provide an empirical estimate\nof the amount of chromospheric heating in a large sample\nof stars covering a wide range of stellar properties.\nIn this paper we present the results of the analysis of\nthe Mg ii k \u03bb 2796.34 \u00c5 emission line of 225 stars, with\nspectral type F6\u2013M6 and luminosity class I\u2013V, as measured from a large number (more than 1400) of IUE spectra. Our sample contains stars with different level of activity, namely dwarfs, very active main sequence stars like\nBY Dra, giants and supergiants, and RS CVn, chromospherically active evolved stars.\nThe interest of our analysis mainly lies in the following\npoints:\n1. The method used to measure intensities of lines is the\nsame for a very large sample of different types of stars.\n2. The absolute flux scale is the same for all our stars and\nis accurate due to the use of high precision measurements of distances.\n3. The effective temperatures and bolometric corrections\nhave been determined fron B \u2212 V colours using unique\naccurate numerical relations.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2 and 3 we\ndescribe our sample of stars, the IUE observations and\ntheir reduction to absolute surface flux units. In Sec. 4\nwe search for trends of estimated chromospheric radiative\nloss rates with basic parameters of stars such as effective\ntemperature Tef f , luminosity and metallicity. In Sec. 5 we\ncompare our observations to avalaible theoretical models\nand our conclusions are given in Sec. 6.\n\n2. Sample of stars\nThe data base used in the present paper was generated starting from the original sample of 230 normal\nstars used in a study of the Wilson\u2013Bappu effect by\nCassatella et al. (2001) (hereafter Paper I). It was a sample of stars with good quality Mg ii observations from IUE\n(see Section 3) and known parallaxes from HIPPARCOS\nwith luminosity classes ranging from I to V. Since for the\npurpose of the present paper we need accurate determination of spectral type, colour and bolometric correction, we\nhave further selected the original sample in order to avoid\nindetermined spectral classification, large errors on B \u2212 V\n(> 0.1) and too large bolometric corrections (< -2.3) (see\nSection 3) because they are too uncertain. We obtained a\nfinal sample of 173 nominally quiet stars.\nIn addition to normal stars, we consider here a sample of 29 very active evolved stars of the RS CVn type.\nThey have been selected following the criteria given in\nCardini et al. (2003) (hereafter Paper II) and further selected following the criteria illustrated above.\n\nFinally, we added a sample of BY Dra stars wich consist of both single and binary dwarf stars having strong\nCa ii H and K emission lines. We have included all objects\nappearing as BY Dra stars in the SIMBAD data base for\nwhich IUE high resolution long-wavelength spectra and\nHIPPARCOS parallaxes were available. As selection criteria, we have adopted the same as Paper I and Paper II\nand described above. These constitute our sample of 23\nchromospherically active main sequence stars with spectral types F to K.\nThe resulting sample (225 stars) consists of an accurately selected, uniformly reduced and homogeneously calibrated data set.\n\n3. Observations and data processing\nThe spectroscopic Mg ii observations have been obtained\nwith the IUE high resolution long wavelength camera. The\ncalibrated spectra have been analysed and processed in\norder to obtain the Mg ii k emission line strength using\nthe method described in Paper II, which consists of a\ndirect integration of the observed profiles, as measured\nabove the photospheric flux level. As stars in our sample all have parallaxes measured astrometrically, they all\nare nearby stars. This makes us confident that the interstellar absorbtion can be neglected. On the other hand\nthe evaluation of the interstellar absorbtion requires information which is usually lacking. The estimated relative\nuncertainty in the derivations of the apparent flux from\nobservations is \u00b115%. In the case of binaries with two\nemitting stars (three known objects between BY Dra and\nfive between RS CVn) we have not deblended both contributions. Indeed AR Lac is the only target in our sample\nin which the individual contribution from the two stars is\nevident as a consequence of their similar Mg ii luminosity\nand of the favorable inclination angle of the system. Due\nto the statistical character of the present investigation,\nwe have not considered it necessary to perform a detailed\nanalysis of these spectra so that the integrated flux of both\ncomponets is considered.\nIn our data sample there are stars that have been observed two or more times. Some active stars have been observed hundreds of times. In all these cases a mean value\nof the flux was computed.\nThe apparent visual magnitudes of all stars along with\ntheir luminosity class, B \u2212 V , trigonometric parallaxes\nand the relative errors were obtained mostly from the\nHIPPARCOS catalogue. In a few cases, mainly regarding RS CVn and BY Dra stars, information on colour\nand luminosity class was taken from the Strasbourgh Data\nCenter (SIMBAD) or from the recent literature. We have\nassumed a typical error of \u00b10.01 mag on visual magnitudes.\nTo convert fluxes at Earth, f , into stellar surface fluxes,\nF , we have used the following relation:\nlog (F/f) = 0.350 + 4 log Teff + 0.4(V + BC)\n\n(1)\n\n\fD.

The constant 0.350 is\nderived from the solar values given by Allen (1983). The\nuncertainty on the chromospheric surface fluxes resulting\nfrom this conversion is hardly evaluable and the cooler\nthe stars the larger the uncertainty. For binaries, we used\ncombined values of B \u2212 V ; in this way a further error in\nthe calculation of surface fluxes is introduced. To prevent\ntoo large uncertainties in BC we have limited our sample\nto B \u2212 V < 1.7 which corresponds to BC \u2248 \u22122.3.\nInformation on metallicity ([Fe/H]) could be found\nonly for a subsample of 130 quiet stars and few very active\nstars (see Carney et al. 1994; Cayrel et al. 1997).\n\nTable 1 and table 2 give the Mg ii k logarithmic surface\nfluxes, together with other relevant data, for BY Dra and\nRS CVn stars respectively.

Discussion of the observations\nIn this Section we investigate the dependence, if any, of the\nchromospheric radiative loss rates on fundamental stellar\nparameters such as luminosity, metallicity, and temperature.\n\n4.1. Line intensity\u2013luminosity relation\nIn Fig. 1 we have plotted the logarithm of the Mg ii k line\nabsolute luminosity against absolute magnitude for normal stars (Fig. 1a) and active stars (Fig. 1b). Also indicated are the linear fits to the data for, separately, evolved\n(crosses) and main sequence (open squares) normal stars.\nTo simplify the figures, error bars are not reported. In the\nfigure are also drawn, for comparison, the \"average\" Mg ii\nk luminosity for quiet solar regions, the \"average\" Mg ii k\nluminosity for plage areas and the Mg ii k luminosity in\nthe flare of September 5, 1973, as reported by Cerruti\u2013Sola\net al. (1992) (filled circles).\nFig. 1a clearly shows that the dependence of the line\nintensity on the stellar luminosity is different for evolved\n\n\f4\n\nD.

A least\u2013squares fit to the data of\nnormal evolved stars (class I\u2013IV) provides:\nlog LMg ii = (30.32\u00b10.01) \u2212 (0.45\u00b10.01) MV\n\n(2)\n\nwith a correlation coefficient of 0.95. The slope coefficient\nof about -0.4 in equation (2) suggests that for giants and\nsupergiants the Mg ii line intensity is directly proportional\nto stellar luminosity.\nA similar fitting procedure applied to normal dwarf\nstars gives:\nlog LMg ii = (30.07\u00b10.04) \u2212 (0.29\u00b10.01) MV\n\n(3)\n\nwith a correlation coefficient of 0.82. The slope coefficient\nsmaller than in Eq. (2) indicates that dwarf stars have an\nexcess of Mg ii k luminosity which increases with increasing magnitude.\nEq. (2) is in very good agreement with the result of\nWeiler & Oegerle (1979) based on stars brighter than MV\n\n= 4 but it is quite different from our fit in Paper II because\nthis last was performed on the whole sample of dwarfs and\ngiants together. Other authors (e.g. Linsky & Ayres 1978;\nWeiler & Oegerle 1979; Basri & Linsky 1979) report, on\nthe basis of a sample mainly containing giant and supergiant stars and only few dwarfs, that the ratio of the Mg ii\nflux rate to stellar luminosity is not dependent on stellar\nluminosity. On the basis of the present analysis, we confirm that this is true only for evolved stars but is not true\nfor main sequence stars.\nAs far as very active stars are concerned, we show\nin Fig. 1b the location of RS CVn + BY Dra in the\n(log LMg ii , MV ) diagram. We can notice that there is\na good correlation between the logarithmic Mg ii k line intensity and MV for RS CVn stars (pluses). A fit to these\ndata gives:\nlog LMg ii = (31.46\u00b10.04) \u2212 (0.33\u00b10.01) MV\n\n(4)\n\n\fD. Cardini: Mg ii emission fluxes in late type stars.\n\n5\n\nTable 3.

Flux\u2013metallicity relation\nIn Fig. 2 is plotted the logarithm of the Mg ii k surface\nflux as a function of metallicity, for the 130 stars for which\nthis latter parameter is known. The figure shows clearly\nthat, in spite of the large range of metallicity covered, the\nradiative losses from the Mg ii k line do not show any correlation with chemical abundance. This is true also considering evolved (crosses) and main sequence stars (open\nsquares) separately. The figure shows also that main sequence stars have greater surface fluxes than evolved stars\nwith the same metallicity, thus confirming the higher level\nof activity of these stars as already pointed out in Sec. 4.1.\n\n\fD. Cardini: Mg ii emission fluxes in late type stars.\n\n7\n\nFig. 2. The logarithm of the surface flux in the Mg ii k\nline is plotted as a function of metallicity for a subsample\nof 130 stars. Open squares indicate main sequence stars\nand crosses indicate evolved stars.\n\n4.3. Flux\u2013colour relation\nIn Fig. 3 we have plotted the observed surface fluxes in\nthe Mg ii k line versus B \u2212 V for normal stars (Fig. 3a)\nand active stars (Fig. 3b).\nIn Fig. 3a we notice that:\n\nFig. 1. The logarithmic absolute luminosity in the Mg ii\nk line is plotted as a function of the absolute visual magnitude. (a) Quiet stars. Dwarfs are shown as open squares\nand evolved stars as crosses. (b) RS CVn (pluses) and BY\nDra stars (diamonds). The best fits to the data of normal\nstars are represented for dwarfs by a dashed line and for\ngiants by a full line. For comparison also data of the Sun\nare reported as filled circles (see text).\n\nDue to the scarcity of the metallicity data available\n(see table 1 and table 2), a similar analysis has not been\nattempted for BY Dra and RS CVn stars.\n\n\u2013 The observed minimum fluxes of giant (crosses) and\nsupergiant (triangles) stars decrease with decreasing\ntemperature.\n\u2013 The observed minimum flux level of supergiants (class\nI\u2013II) is a factor of two larger in FMg ii compared to\ngiant stars of the same colour.\n\u2013 Surface fluxes of luminosity class V stars (open\nsquares) are only weakly dependent on temperature,\nif not all. It is difficult for these stars to identify a\nline of minimum fluxes as they are sparsely distributed\nwith a spread of about one order of magnitude at high\ntemperatures.\nAs for stars with known very active chromospheres\nshown in Fig. 3b we observe that:\n\u2013 RS CVn binaries (pluses) lie far above typical stars\nas seen before (Sec. 4.1). Minimum fluxes for these\nstars are well represented by the line of minimum fluxes\ndefined by giants enhanced by a factor as large as 20.\n\u2013 BY Dra stars (diamonds) lie 0.6 dex above normal\nmain squence stars. Their observed fluxes do not show\nany dependence on temperature.\n\n\f8\n\nD. Cardini: Mg ii emission fluxes in late type stars.\n\nFig. 3. The logarithm of the observed surface flux in the Mg ii k line is plotted as a function of B \u2212 V . (a) Quiet stars.\nDwarfs are shown as open squares, class III\u2013IV stars as crosses and class I\u2013II stars as triangles. (b) BY Dra stars\n(diamonds) and RS CVn (pluses). Also shown in each panel are the theoretical fluxes for pure acustic wave heating\n(dashed) and for magnetic wave heating in flux tubes (solid) as given by Fawzy et al. (2002b; Fig. 11) and corrected\nto consider the k line only. The dotted line in panel (a) represent the observational minimum limits by Rutten et al.\n(1991). The dash\u2013dotted line in panel (b) is the theoretical flux for pure acustic wave heating increased by 1.3 dex.\n\n5. Interpretation of the results\n\nMg ii lines (Schrijver 1987; Mathioudakis & Doyle 1992;\nRutten et al. 1991; Fawzy et al. 2002b).\n\nIn Fig. 3 we compare our observational determination of\nMg ii k line fluxes at stellar surfaces with the simulated estimates of the same quantities computed by Fawzy et al.\n(2002b) using two\u2013component models of stellar chromospheres for late\u2013type main sequence stars. The dashed line\nrefers to fluxes computed taking into account pure acustic\nwave heating only (basal fluxes). In addition to this mechanism the models predict an increase in Mg ii emission\ndue to magnetic tube waves proportional to the fraction\nof the stellar surface covered by magnetic fields (filling factor) (Fawzy et al. 2002a). The solid curve in Fig. 3 refers\nto a magnetic filling factor of 0.4 which corresponds to\nmaximum efficiency in magnetic wave heating and then\ndetermines the upper boundary of the chromospheric activity. Fig. 3a also shows the observational minimum limits from Rutten et al. (1991) (dotted line). All the quoted\ncurves have been decreased by a factor of two to consider\nthe k line only.\n\nThe Ca ii theoretical low and upper emission boundaries agree with the observations within a factor of two,\nwhich is justified given the inaccuracies in the model\nand/or by uncertainties in observed flux determinations.\nFor Mg ii, Fawzy et al. (2002b), comparing their theoretical emission fluxes with observational fluxes given by\nRutten et al. (1991), concluded that the modeled minimum flux limit was within a factor of two compatible with\nobservations, but, even taking a factor of two uncertainty\ninto account, the upper limit obtained was persistently\nlower than the maximum observed emission.\n\nBuchholz et al. (1998) have simulated chromospheric\nMg ii minimum emission fluxes both for main sequence stars and giants concluding that they are essentially the same. Thus, minimum fluxes computed by\nFawzy et al. (2002b) for dwarf stars can be considered valid also for giants. The existence of such a common lower boundary in the surface flux versus colour is\nstrongly supported by the observations of the Ca ii and\n\nLooking at our data in Fig. 3a we see that our observational minimum limit is well defined in the range of\nB \u2212 V between 0.85 and 1.5, where numerous giant stars\n(class III) are present. This limit is in good agreement with\nthe line of acoustic wave heating of Fawzy et al. (2002b)\n(dashed line in Fig. 3), both in absolute magnitude (within\na factor of about 1.5) and in terms of temperature dependence. At higher temperatures, where only main sequence\nstars are present, the minimum flux levels are less well\ndefined, but they are still compatible with the theoretical lower limit. Note that the present minimum fluxes lie\nabove the limit given by Rutten et al. (1991). Class I\u2013II\nstars emission fluxes are greater than that of class III stars.\nThis fact, not caused by magnetic heating, is probably due\nto their lower surface gravity.\n\n\fD. Cardini: Mg ii emission fluxes in late type stars.\n\nIn our sample of \"normal\" stars, the maximum values\nof Mg ii fluxes are observed in main sequence stars. If, as\nsaid before, dwarf and giant stars have the same lower\nboundary, then the spread of Mg ii fluxes in the vertical\ndirection is larger for dwarfs than for giants stars (not considering supergiants). This means that dwarfs may have\na range of activity levels greater than giants of the same\nspectral type. We can see that 60% of normal main sequence stars lie below the theoretical magnetic wave heating line and all but one lie below the theoretical upper\nlimit if a factor of two uncertainty is taken into account.\nEvidently a large fraction of the atmosphere of dwarfs may\nbe dominated by magnetic heating but their emission can\nbe accounted for by present models.\nOn the contrary the cited two\u2013component models seem\nto be inadequate to explain the observed chromospheric\nradiative loss rates of BY Dra and RS CVn stars.\nFawzy et al. (2002a) models describe correctly the\nchromospheres of solar\u2013type stars with low and moderate levels of activity. In addition their models are\nbased on uniformly distributed magnetic flux tubes. BY\nDra stars are generally attributed deep convection zones\nand fast rotation rates that enhance magnetic activity\nand it is known that BY Dra stars have large spotted\nregions (Stewart et al. 1988; Baliunas & Vaughan 1985;\nSaar et al. 1992).\nIn our data shown in Fig. 3b, the BY Dra stars have\nMg ii fluxes which show no dependence on temperature,\nand they all lie above the line of magnetic wave heating\n(full line) with a mean value of 6.3 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 (see\nalso Sec. 4.1). Looking at the data relative to the Sun reported in Fig. 3, the value of 6.3 corresponds, following an\nempirical computation, to a fraction of stellar surface covered by plages of about 32%, if the brightness of typical\nsolar plages is assumed (it is not excluded however that\nthe intrinsic brightness of the plage regions exceeds that\nof typical solar plages) (Cerruti-Sola et al. 1992). Perhaps\nstronger magnetic fields and a modeling different from\nmagnetic flux tubes are necessary to account for the peculiarities of this kind of star.\nFig. 3b also shows that RS CVn stars lie far above\nnormal-chromosphere stars (see also Fig.1b). They seem\nto have a dependence on the effective temperature which\nfollows the slope of the basal flux enhanced by a factor as\nlarge as 20 (dash\u2013dotted line in Fig.3b). However this feature may be simulated by different orbital periods. These\nchromospherically active stars are members of binary systems and interactions between the two components could\nproduce excess heating by completely non-magnetic processes such as mass transfer and accretion, tidal interactions and resonances. These other physical processes could\naffect chromospheric activity in addition to magnetic field\nstrength (see for example Glebocki & Stawikowski 1988).\n\n6. Conclusion\nIn this paper we have addressed the still unsolved problem\nof identifying the possible physical processes responsible\n\n9\n\nfor chromospheric heating. To this purpose we have measured intensities of the Mg ii k line in a large number of\nIUE spectra and we have carried out an analytical study\nfor different types of stars. The results obtained can be\nsummarized as follows:\n\u2013 Metallicity does not affect the emission flux level of the\nMg ii k line.\n\u2013 The logarithm of the total k line emission luminosity is\nlinearly related to the absolute visual magnitude. For\nevolved stars, both normal and RS CVn, the correlation is very strong and allows the linear relationships\nin Eq. (2) and (4) to be defined. Main sequence stars,\nboth normal and BY Dra, are less correlated in the\n(MV , log LMg ii ) plane and show a smaller slope.\n\u2013 There are indications that the Mg ii k flux increases\nslowly with decreasing stellar gravity (supergiants).\n\u2013 The observed range of chromospheric activity in the\nMg ii k line in normal stars is fully accounted for by\ncurrent models based on acoustic and magnetic wave\nheating in the form of magnetic flux tubes.\n\u2013 Peculiar objects, like BY Dra and RS CVn, for which\ncurrent models are inadequate to explain the very large\nstrength of the Mg ii k line, require that additional\nheating processes be taken into account.\nAcknowledgements.
