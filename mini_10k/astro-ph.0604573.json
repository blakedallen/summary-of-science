If field freezing were to\napply (the ideal MHD conditions), newly formed solar-type stars should have surface fields\nof \u223c 107 G (e.g., Mestel & Spitzer 1956), which is several thousand times larger than given\nby the observations of T Tauri stars (e.g., Johns-Krull, Valenti, & Saar 2004). Magnetic-field\ndissipation is crucial to the resolution of this contradiction. In this paper, we demonstrate\nthat it is also needed to avoid an extremely efficient magnetic braking that would prevent\nthe formation of the observed protoplanetary disks around young stars.\nAllen, Shu & Li (2003; hereafter A03a) performed informative numerical simulations of\nthe collapse of isothermal magnetized toroids, which are axially symmetric equilibrium configurations with spatially uniform mass-to-flux ratio (such configuration is called isopedic).\nThese are pivotal states at time t = 0, in the sense that they represent the idealized state of\na molecular cloud core at the instant of formation of a central density cusp, and separate the\npre-protostellar phase of evolution from the protostellar accretion phase (Li & Shu 1996).\nThe structure of these toroids is completely determined by the single parameter H0 , that\nis the fraction of support provided against self-gravity by poloidal magnetic fields relative\nto that of gas pressure (Li & Shu 1996). The collapse of singular isothermal toroids occurs\ninside-out in a self-similar manner (A03a), in which matter collapses toward the central point\nmass dragging magnetic field lines along with it.\nLater, Allen, Li & Shu (2003; hereafter A03b) included angular momentum characterized by a flat rotation curve in these models. The formation of a centrifugally supported\ndisk around the central star did not occur for any reasonable nonzero value of the magnetic\nsupport parameter H0 . They concluded that, in ideal MHD conditions (i.e., no magnetic\nfield dissipation), the efficiency of magnetic braking was so high as to prevent disk forma-\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\ntion. Simulations with limited numerical resolution can be suggestive, but proof requires an\nanalytic or semi-analytic demonstration. Analytic or semi-analytic results have the added\nadvantage that they can be the starting points for additional development, such as providing\na background equatorial collapse against which a bipolar outflow might simultaneously be\ntaking place along the poles (Lizano et al. 2006, in preparation), or for an extension into the\nnon-ideal regime (Shu et al. 2006).\nMotivated by these considerations, in this paper we determine analytically the asymptotic behavior of the density, velocity and magnetic field in the self-similar collapse of an\nisothermal magnetized rotating cloud. We find that at small scales the density and poloidal\nvelocity field in the collapse solution approaches free-fall on a split magnetic monopole configuration, with the azimuthal velocity decreasing to zero at the origin. This result proves\nthat, without magnetic field dissipation, a centrifugally supported disk around the accreting\ncentral star cannot form.\nThe organization of the paper is as follows. In \u00a72 we discuss the relevant ideal MHD\nequations. In \u00a73 we put these equations in non-dimensional self-similar form. In \u00a74 we write\nthe self-similar equations in a streamline formulation, in terms of the Grad-Shafranov and\nBernoulli's equation, and take the limit for small values of the self-similar variable x = r/at,\nwhere r is the spherical radius, a is the sound speed of the cloud and t is the time variable. In\n\u00a75 we show some numerical examples of our inner solution for the case of no rotation, using\nthe numerical simulations of A03a to obtain an approximation for the mass loading of field\nlines. In \u00a76 we consider the effects of rotation and show that the azimuthal velocity vanishes\nat the origin, i.e., the efficient magnetic braking prevents the formation of a centrifugally\ndisk around the star. Finally, in \u00a78, we discuss the implications of our work and summarize\nour conclusions.\n\n2.\n\nIdeal MHD equations\n\nThe equations governing the collapse of an isothermal magnetized cloud are the equation\nof continuity\n\u2202\u03c1\n+ \u2207 * (\u03c1u) = 0,\n(1)\n\u2202t\nwhere \u03c1 is the density and u is the velocity of the gas; the equation of motion\n1\na2\n1\n\u2202u\n+ (\u2207 \u00d7 u) \u00d7 u + \u2207|u|2 = \u2212 \u2207\u03c1 \u2212 \u2207V +\n(\u2207 \u00d7 B) \u00d7 B,\n\u2202t\n2\n\u03c1\n4\u03c0\u03c1\n\n(2)\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nwhere V is the gravitational potential and B is the magnetic field, the induction equation\nin the ideal MHD limit\n\u2202B\n= \u2207 \u00d7 (u \u00d7 B),\n(3)\n\u2202t\nthe condition of no monopoles,\n\u2207 * B = 0,\n(4)\nand Poisson's equation\n\u22072 V = 4\u03c0G\u03c1,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant.\nThe geometry of the collapse is shown in Figure 1. A separatrix indicated in dashed\nlines separates field lines which have been pulled into the origin by the inflow from field lines\ntied to matter in the infalling envelope (see, e.g., Figures 4, 6 and 7 of A03a). We will study\nonly the region inside the separatrix surface that is close to the origin (within the dotted\ncircle in Figure 1).\n\n3.\n\nSelf-similar variables\n\nSince the singular isothermal toroids defining the pivotal t = 0 states are self-similar,\nwe look for collapse solutions depending only on the similarity coordinate x, defined by\nr = atx.\nWe introduce appropriate nondimensional (reduced) variables defined as\n1\n\u03c1(r, t) =\n\u03b1(x),\n4\u03c0Gt2\nu(r, t) = av(x),\n2\n\nV (r, t) = a \u03a8(x),\na\nB(r, t) = 1/2 b(x).\nG t\n\n(6)\n\n(7)\n(8)\n(9)\n(10)\n\nInserting the definitions (6)\u2013(10) into eq. (1)\u2013(3), we obtain the set of nondimensional\nequations governing the self-similar collapse,\n(v \u2212 x) * \u2207\u03b1 + \u03b1\u2207 * v = 2\u03b1,\n1\n1\n1\n\u2212(x * \u2207)v + (\u2207 \u00d7 v) \u00d7 v + \u2207|v|2 = \u2212 \u2207\u03b1 \u2212 \u2207\u03a8 + (\u2207 \u00d7 b) \u00d7 b,\n2\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u2212(x * \u2207)b = b + \u2207 \u00d7 (v \u00d7 b),\n\n(11)\n(12)\n\n\u2207 * b = 0,\n\n(14)\n\n\u22072 \u03a8 = \u03b1.\n\n(15)\n\n(13)\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n4.\n\nThe inner limit\n\nIn the limit |x| \u226a 1 we approximate for any vector or scalar variable f,\nf \u223c (x * \u2207)f \u226a (v * \u2207)f.\n\n(16)\n\nWith these approximations, eq. (11)\u2013(13) become\n\u2207 * (\u03b1v) = 0,\n\n(17)\n\n1\n1\n1\n(\u2207 \u00d7 v) \u00d7 v + \u2207|v|2 = \u2212 \u2207\u03b1 \u2212 \u2207\u03a8 + (\u2207 \u00d7 b) \u00d7 b,\n2\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u2207 \u00d7 (v \u00d7 b) = 0.\n\n(18)\n(19)\n\nThese equations for the self-similar variables in the inner region are formally equivalent to\nthe dimensional equations of steady, ideal MHD flow. The time-dependent self-similar flow\nbecomes quasi-steady when the time it takes the flow to cross the inner region becomes small\ncompared to the evolutionary time governing changes of the infall envelope that feeds matter and field into the inner regions. The latter condition holds independent of the starting\nassumption of self-similarity of the overall collapse (see e.g. Galli & Shu 1993b), and therefore our results have greater generality than its formal derivation here. In the steady-flow\napproximation, we may profitably introduce a streamline formalism (e.g, Shafranov 1966;\nShu al. 1994).\nIn the following we adopt spherical coordinates (x, \u03b8, \u03c6), and assume that the system\nis axisymmetric (\u2202/\u2202\u03c6 = 0). Then eq.

We note that \u03b2 is antisymmetric with respect\nto the equatorial plane (by convention, \u03b2 negative corresponds to the upper hemisphere).\nIf we dot the force equation (18) with v we obtain Bernoulli's equation\n1 2\n|v| + ln \u03b1 + \u03a8 = H(\u03c8),\n2\n\n(26)\n\nwhere H(\u03c8) is Bernoulli's function which is constant on streamlines. Substituting this equation and using the definition of \u03b2, eq. (24), in the equation of motion, eq.

(25), eq. (35) reduces to\nv * \u2207j = 0,\n\n(37)\n\nstating that j = j(\u03c8) is constant along streamlines. Thus, the toroidal velocity is given by\nv\u03c6 =\n\nj(\u03c8)\n.\nx sin \u03b8(1 \u2212 \u03b1\u03b2 2 )\n\n(38)\n\nNotice the formal singular point that arises when \u03b1\u03b2 2 = 1, which is the condition of the\npoloidal velocity reaching the Alfven speed. In fact, the smooth crossing of this surface (with\na continously varying v\u03c6 ) is made in a time-dependent way; as will be shown in Sect. 5, the\npoloidal velocity is distinctly subalfv\u00e8nic (\u03b1\u03b2 2 \u226b 1) in the steady part of the flow. Finally,\nBernoulli's eq.

These need to be\nsolved for the stream function \u03c8 and the density \u03b1 (or the Alfv\u00e8n discriminant A), given the\nfunctions H(\u03c8), j(\u03c8), and \u03b2(\u03c8), which are quantities conserved along streamlines. Then,\nthe toroidal components of the magnetic field and the velocity can be obtained from eq. (24)\nand (38), respectively.\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\n5.\n\nCase of no rotation (j = 0)\n\nWe first consider the case of no rotation, and we look for a separable solution in spherical\ncoordinates in which all variables have a power-law dependence on x. One can show that\nthe density and the stream function must have forms that represent magnetically-modulated\nfree-fall solutions:\n\u0014\n\u00151/2\nm0 (1 + H0 )\n\u03b1(x, \u03b8) =\nx\u22123/2 Q(\u03b8),\n(40)\n2\nand\n\u03c8(x, \u03b8) = m0 (1 + H0 )f (\u03b8),\n\n(41)\n\nwhere Q(\u03b8) is normalized so that\nZ\n\n\u03c0/2\n\nQ(\u03b8) sin \u03b8 d\u03b8 = 1.\n\n(42)\n\n0\n\nThe angular part of the stream function, f (\u03b8), is normalized so that f (0) = 1 and f (\u03c0/2) = 0,\ni.e., the streamlines between those falling in equatorially and along the pole carry the entire\nmass infall rate of the upper hemisphere.\nTo find the unknown functions Q(\u03b8) and f (\u03b8) we need to balance the highest order\nterms in eqs. (34) and (39). The dominant terms that balance in the G-S equation, eq. (34),\nare then\n\u2212\u03b2 2 S(\u03c8) \u2248 \u03b2\u03b2 \u2032 |\u2207\u03c8|2 ,\n(43)\nwhere the Alfv\u00e8n discriminant, A \u2248 \u2212\u03b2 2 , corresponds to highly subalfv\u00e8nic poloidal flow.\nIn Bernoulli's equation the dominant terms that balance are the poloidal kinetic energy\nand the gravitational potential energy. With the gravitational potential of a point mass at\nthe origin, \u03a8 = \u2212m0 (1 + H0 )/x, we get\n|\u2207\u03c8|2 \u2248 2m0 (1 + H0 )\u03b12 x sin2 \u03b8.\n\n(44)\n\nSubstituting the definitions (40) and (41) in this latter equation, one gets\ndf\n= \u2212Q(\u03b8) sin \u03b8.\nd\u03b8\n\n(45)\n\nThe G-S equation (43)now becomes a second-order, nonlinear, ordinary differential equation\nfor f (\u03b8),\n\u0012 \u00132\nd2 f\ndf\n\u03b2 \u2032 df\n\u2212 cot \u03b8 +\n= 0.\n(46)\nd\u03b82\nd\u03b8\n\u03b2 d\u03b8\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nCombining the Bernoulli equation (45) and the G-S equation (46), one obtains\n\u03b2\u2032\ndQ\n= \u2212 Q,\ndf\n\u03b2\n\n(47)\n\n\u03b2\u0304\n,\n\u03b2(f )\n\n(48)\n\nwhich has the solution\nQ(f ) =\n\nwhere \u03b2\u0304 is an integration constant. Furthermore, f (\u03b8) has the parametric solution\n1\ncos \u03b8(f ) =\n\u03b2\u0304\n\nZ\n\nf\n\n\u03b2(f ) df,\n\n(49)\n\n0\n\nwhere we have used the B.C. f (\u03c0/2) = 0. Moreover, the B.C. f (0) = 1, implies that\nZ 1\n\u03b2\u0304 =\n\u03b2(f ) df.\n\n(50)\n\n0\n\nThe physical meaning of the above results is simple. Equation (49) implies that the\npoloidal field lines spread so as to distribute themselves uniformly in polar angle, i.e., the\nmagnetic configuration takes the shape of a split monopole, as anticipated by Galli & Shu\n(1993a; see their Figure 2) and confirmed later by Li & Shu (1997) for the collapse of an\ninfinitesimally thin disk. This happens because the field lines trapped in the central mass\npoint become so strong that the mass inflow, being highly subalfv\u00e8nic, is unable to bend them\nfrom the zeroth-order vacuum field configuration. In turn, the matter is constrained by field\nfreezing to flow along the radial field lines, and the density distribution is that appropriate\nfor free-fall along each radial path (eq. 41), but it departs from a homogenous angular\ndistribution in a manner that depends only on the initial mass-to-flux loading (eq. 48).\nGiven the above interpretation, it is useful to define the magnetic flux function\n\u03a6(r, t) =\n\n2\u03c0a3 t\n\u03c6(x),\nG1/2\n\n(51)\n\nfrom which we may obtain the poloidal field B:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03a6\nB=\u2207\u00d7\n\u00ea\u03c6 .\n2\u03c0r sin \u03b8\n\n(52)\n\nThe components of the poloidal magnetic field, in nondimensional units, are given by\nbx =\n\n1 \u2202\u03c6\n,\nx2 sin \u03b8 \u2202\u03b8\n\nand b\u03b8 = \u2212\n\n1 \u2202\u03c6\n.\nx sin \u03b8 \u2202x\n\n(53)\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nComparing these definitions with equations (21), and using the definition of \u03b2, eq. (24), one\nsees that there is a simple relation between the flux and the stream function given by\nd\u03c6 = \u03b2 d\u03c8\n\n(54)\n\nThus, the parametric equation for \u03c8, eq. (49), simply states that\n\u03c6 = \u03c6\u22c6 (1 \u2212 cos \u03b8),\n\n(55)\n\nwhere \u03c6\u22c6 = \u03c6(\u03c0/2) (just above the midplane) is the nondimensional magnetic flux trapped\nin the central source. In fact, \u03c6\u22c6 labels the flux of the separatrix (see Figure 1). Moreover,\nthe normalization eq. (50) and eq. (54) give\n\u03b2\u0304 = \u2212\n\n\u03c6\u22c6\n.\nm0 (1 + H0 )\n\n(56)\n\nSince every field line that lies interior to the separatrix threads the mass point at the center,\none has the immediate identification that\n\u03bb\u22c6 = \u2212\u03b2\u0304 \u22121 =\n\nm0 (1 + H0 )\n,\n\u03c6\u22c6\n\n(57)\n\nwhere \u03bb\u22c6 is the nondimensional mass-to-flux ratio of the central star defined as\n\u03bb\u22c6 \u2261\n\n2\u03c0G1/2 M\u22c6\n.\n\u03a6(r, \u03c0/2)\n\n(58)\n\nTo summarize, the solution for small x consists of streamlines which are radial but nonuniformly distributed in \u03b8. The \u03b8 dependence of both \u03c8 and \u03b1 is determined by the mass\nloading of field lines represented by \u03b2(\u03c8), assumed to be known from the matching to the\nouter collapse solution. According to eqs. (21) and (45), the radial velocity is just free-fall,\ni.e.,\n\u0014\n\u00151/2\n2m0 (1 + H0 )\nvx = \u2212\n.\n(59)\nx\nBy eq. (24), the magnetic field is that of a split monopole at the the origin,\nbx =\n\n\u03c6\u22c6\n,\nx2\n\n(60)\n\nas inferred by A03a,b. In physical units, the magnetic field of the split monopole is\nBr = \u03c6\u22c6\n\na3 t\n,\nG1/2 r 2\n\n(61)\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nand is maintained by a current sheet in the equatorial plane, with current density in the\nazimuthal direction\ncBr\nJ\u03c6 =\n\u03b4(\u03b8 \u2212 \u03c0/2).\n(62)\n2\u03c0r\nSince the radial velocity increases as vx \u221d x\u22121/2 , while the (nondimensional) Alfv\u00e8n\nspeed increases much faster, vA = bx /\u03b11/2 \u221d x\u22125/4 , the flow asymptotically becomes highly\nsubalfv\u00e8nic, consistent with our assumption for A in eq. (43).\n\n6.\n\nCase with rotation (j 6= 0).\n\nIn the case j = 0, the balance across and along streamlines is achieved by terms of order\nx (see eq. 43 and 44). Multiplying eq. (34) by A, and eq. (39) by A2 , one can show that\nthe highest-order balance of the G-S and Bernoulli equations for j 6= 0 is unchanged. Thus,\nthe non-rotating solution for the density \u03b1 and the radial velocity and magnetic field, vx\nand bx , derived in the previous Section remains valid for x \u226a 1, for any value of j. This is\nconsistent with the findings of A03b that the isodensity contours and poloidal field (stream)\nlines are the same to zeroth approximation in the rotating and non-rotating case for small\nx.\n\u22122\n\nUsing eq. (37) together with the equation of continuity, eq. (17), the conservation of\ntotal angular momentum, \u2207 * (\u03b1vj) = 0, can be written as\n\u2207 * (\u03b1vp jg ) = \u2207 * (bp b\u03c6 x sin \u03b8)\n\n(63)\n\nwhere the gas specific angular momentum is jg = x sin \u03b8v\u03c6 . This equation can be integrated\nover the upper hemisphere as\nZ\nZ\n\u03b1jg vp * dS = x sin \u03b8b\u03c6 bp * dS,\n(64)\nwhere dS = 2\u03c0x2 sin \u03b8d\u03b8 \u00eax . The left hand side is rate of change of the gas specific angular\nmomentum and the right hand side is the magnetic torque. Given our inner solution, the\nintegral on the left hand side is \u221d xv\u03c6 and the magnetic torque is \u221d x\u22121/2 v\u03c6 . Thus, the\nmagnetic torque eventually dominates, decreasing the net gas angular momentum and forcing\nthe azimuthal velocity to deviate from the v\u03c6 \u221d x\u22121 , behavior valid in the absence of\nmagnetic torques. As discussed above, for small x the flow becomes subalfv\u00e8nic (\u03b1\u03b2 2 \u226b 1).\nThus, eq. (38) for the azimuthal velocity, together with eq. (40), implies that along each\nstreamline v\u03c6 \u221d x1/2 , i.e., the azimuthal velocity decreases to zero at the origin. The\nlong lever arm associated with the divergently strong split monopole field yields highly\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nefficient magnetic-braking, causing the gas to spiral into the central star without forming a\ncentrifugally supported disk, as suggested by A03b.\nFinally, from eq. (24), one can obtain the toroidal magnetic field component b\u03c6 \u221d x\u22121 ,\nthat increases with decreasing radius more slowly than the poloidal component bx (eq. (60)).\nThus, the winding of the field (b\u03c6 /bx \u221d x) goes to zero as x \u2192 0, where the field geometry is\ndominated by the split monopole at the origin. Thus, in our treatment, reconnection of the\npoloidal magnetic field because of the sheet current that prevails in the magnetic midplane\nis more important than reconnection of the toroidal component that results because of the\nspinup of inflowing matter. In realistic circumstances, this state of affairs may change after\nthe poloidal field is nearly entirely dissipated and a centrifugal disk is formed that can wind\nup relatively weak fields into a predominantly toroidal configuration.\nFigure 2 summarizes the results of this Section and illustrates qualitatively the behavior\nof the azimuthal velocity in the equatorial plane of a collapsing magnetized cloud. We\nstress that different choices of the mass-loading of field lines specified by the function \u03b2(\u03c8)\nwould merely change the details of when and where the maximum rotational velocity is\nreached in the inflow solution, not the fact that the inflowing matter eventually loses all\nits specific angular momentum. In the next section, adopting a specific collapse model,\nwe will show quantitatively that the region where magnetic braking by the split monopole\nbecomes dominant over angular momentum conservation is generally larger than the size of\na centrifugally supported disk formed in the absence of magnetic torques.\n\n7.\n\nMatching to the outer collapse solution\n\nWe can match our inner collapse solution x \u226a 1 to the outer collapse solution via the\nmass-loading function, \u03b2(\u03c8), and the specific total angular momentum, j(\u03c8). We use the\nsimulations of A03a to perform this asymptotic matching. The exercise is nontrivial since\ncollapse simulations with very high grid resolution are required to provide the \"inner limit\nof the outer solution,\" onto which we wish to match the \"outer limit of the inner solution.\"\nFor our purposes, there is a further problem with the boundary condition imposed by Allen\nand co-workers on the radial field, namely bx = 0 at \u03b8 = \u03c0/2. This boundary condition,\nappropriate to the outside of the separatrix, is in conflict with the magnetic field configuration\ninside of the separatrix (that becomes the split monopole solution at small x) depicted in\nFigure 1. In fact, unlike the analytic work, it is numerically impossible to allow a current\nsheet at the equator (where bx is discontinuous at the midplane) since this configuration is\nunstable to magnetic reconnection via numerical diffusion (see, e.g., Figure 4 of Galli & Shu\n1993b). In spite of these drawbacks, we use the numerical \u03b2 obtained from the simulations of\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nA03a to apply to our models, trusting the conservation principle associated with field freezing\nto yield the correct mass-to-flux loading for all colatitudes except close to the equator.\nIn Figure 3 the logarithm of |\u03b2| is plotted as a function of the normalized flux, \u03be = \u03c6/\u03c6\u22c6 ,\nfor different values of H0 increasing from bottom to top. The points are the results of the\nsimulations. The broken lines are fits given by\n\u2212\u03b2H0 = b exp(\u2212c\u03be)\u03be \u2212H0 1 \u2212 \u03be 4\n\n\u00012\n\n+ H0 ,\n\n(65)\n\nwhere b = H00.2 exp(3.3H0 ) and c = 1.6 + 2.3H0 . These broken lines yield a good representation of the numerical data for all angles except those close to the equator, \u03be = 1. The\nnumerical \u03b2 goes to zero due to the boundary condition discussed above (see eq. 24). The\nanalytic solution requires \u03b2 to be finite and \u03b2 \u2032 = 0 at the midplane; otherwise the density\ngradient will become discontinuous.\nNote that the function \u03b2 diverges at the pole (\u03b8 = 0) because in the starting toroids the\ndensity there goes to zero. Finally, since the numerical simulations give \u03b2(\u03c6), not \u03b2(\u03c8), we\nuse the fact that d\u03c8 = \u03c6\u22c6 d\u03be/\u03b2(\u03be), to obtain from eq. 54) and (57)\nZ 1\nd\u03be\n\u03bb\u22c6 = \u2212\n.\n(66)\n0 \u03b2(\u03be)\nThe numerical values of \u03bb\u22c6 can be determined only approximately, owing to the effects of\nthe boundary condition at the midplane on the numerical values of \u03b2. Roughly, we obtain\n\u03bb\u22c6 \u2248 3\u20134 for H0 = 0.125, \u03bb\u22c6 \u2248 2.4\u20132.7 for H0 = 0.25, \u03bb\u22c6 \u2248 1.2\u20131.7 for H0 = 0.5, and\n\u03bb\u22c6 = 1.0\u20131.3 for H0 = 1. These values are closer to the mass-to-flux ratio \u03bbr than they are\nto \u03bb as tabulated in Table 1 of Li & Shu (1996). The former applies for the initial state of\nan isopedic toroid when one integrates for the mass along flux tubes for given H0 only to a\nspherical surface of radius r, whereas the latter applies if one integrates all the way out to \u221e.\nFor given trapped flux, we can expect mass accumulation to behave in the latter case only\nin the case of complete flattening, H0 \u2192 \u221e. For more modest values of H0 , we can expect a\nmore nearly spherical reach for both mass and flux when the configuration collapses, yielding\nthe closer correspondence of \u03bb\u22c6 to \u03bbr .\nIn contrast, T Tauri stars have observed values of \u03bb\u22c6 \u2248 103 \u2013104 (see e.g. Johns-Krull\net al. 2004), implying that the assumption of field-freezing must break down at some point\nin the star formation process (Shu et al. 2006). As expected, according to our ideal MHD\nsolution the magnetic field trapped in the central protostar exceeds observed stellar fields by\nthree-four orders of magnitude. The four panels of Figure 4 show our inner collapse solutions\nin self-similar coordinates for the four values of H0 given above. The heavy solid contours\nin each panel are isodensity contours and the radial lines are the magnetic field lines (which\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\ncoincide with the streamlines). The arrows show the velocity field at different radii. The\ndynamic pseudodisks that result may bear comparison with observations of young protostars\nbefore they have developed full disks (Hogerheijde 2004).\nQuantitatively, the condition for subalfv\u00e8nic radial flow \u03b1\u03b2 2 > 1, necessary for strong\nmagnetic braking according to the results described in the previous section, is valid in a\nregion x < xA (\u03b8) where xA is the nondimensional Alfv\u00e8n radius. With our asymptotic\nexpressions for vx and bx (eq. 59 and 60) and our fitting formula for \u03b2 (eq. 65), it is possible\nto estimate the value of xA on the midplane (\u03b8 = \u03c0/2), obtaining xA \u2248 0.085, 0.18, and 0.45\nfor H0 = 0.125, 0.25 and 0.5. These values can be compared with the expected disk radius\nfor the collapse of a non-magnetized Toomre-Hayashi toroid, xd \u2248 0.25v02 , where v0 is the\n(uniform) rotation velocity in units of the isothermal sound speed a (A03b). The magnitude\nof v0 for molecular cloud cores ranges from 0.03 to 0.4, with typical value v0 \u2248 0.1 (Goodman\net al. 1993), in which case xd \u2248 0.0025. Thus, xd \u226a xA even for weakly magnetized clouds\n(H0 = 0.125\u20130.5), and the formation of a centrifugally supported disk cannot take place.\nEven for the weakly-magnetized, fast-rotating cloud model with v0 = 0.5 and H0 = 0.25\nconsidered by A03b (see their Fig. 7), the radius of the disk that would be formed in the\nabsence of magnetic torques, xd \u2248 0.063, is about 3 times smaller than the Alfv\u00e8n radius,\nxA \u2248 0.18, explaining why A03b did not observe the formation a centrifugal disk even in\nthis extreme model.\n\n8.\n\nComparison with previous work\n\nThe process of magnetic braking has been usually considered in the context of the quasistatic evolution of a molecular cloud core (e.g. Gillis, Mestel & Paris 1974,1979; Mouschovias\n& Paleologou 1979). Recent semi-analytical calculations and numerical simulations have\nextended these works to follow the increase of density towards the formation of an optically\nthick core (Tomisaka 2002, Machida et al. 2005a,b) and through the formation of a point-mass\ninto the protostellar accretion phase (Li & Shu 1997; Ciolek & K\u00f6nigl 1998; Contopoulos,\nCiolek & K\u00f6nigl 1998; A03a,b). Krasnopolsky & K\u00f6nigl (2002) extended the semi-analytical\ncalculations by Contopoulos et al. (1998) to study the collapse of magnetized, rotating, thin\ndisks surrounded by an external medium with specified physical properties. They found that\nthe decoupling of matter and magnetic field (by ambipolar diffusion) is carried by an outward\npropagating shock, as first suggested by Li & McKee (1996), and the infalling rotating\nmaterial is halted by a centrifugal shock inside which a centrifugal disk is established. The\nformation and radial extent of the centrifugal disk depend on two main parameters: the ratio\n\u03b4 of the azimuthal and vertical components of the magnetic field at the disk surface and the\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nAlfven speed in the external medium, both controlling the importance of magnetic braking\nduring the collapse. In the ideal MHD case (no ambipolar diffusion), for models with a large\nwinding of the magnetic field (\u03b4 = 10) they obtain complete braking, i.e. no centrifugal disk\nis formed. As in our case, the horizontal flow approaches free-fall onto the central mass and\nthe magnetic field of the protostar is that of a split monopole at the origin. However, our\nmodel differs from theirs in that our collapsing cores are 3-D with axial symmetry and we do\nnot include an external medium. The magnetic braking is due to the field lines that connect\nthe inner region, x \u226a 1, with the rest of the collapsing cloud and thus the magnetic field\nwinding and magnetic braking are calculated self-consistently (through the functions j and\n\u03b2). In addition, we find that the radial component of the field largely dominates over the\nazimuthal component at small radii, so the winding of the field is never as severe as assumed\nby Krasnopolsky & K\u00f6nigl (2002).\n\n9.\n\nSummary and conclusions\n\nWe have examined the properties of the inner regions of an ideally magnetized, isothermal, rotating cloud undergoing gravitational collapse. The density distribution and the\npoloidal velocity field in the collapse solution approach free-fall forms, while the trapped\nmagnetic field rooted in the central protostar acquires a split monopole configuration. An\nanalytic solution can be obtained for the central regions if numerical simulations are used\nto obtain the loading function that determines how much mass is coming down a given field\nline. For illustrative purposes, we have adopted the mass loading function \u03b2 from the numerical simulations of A03a. We note, however, that the properties of our collapse solution\ndiscussed in Sect. 5 and Sect. 6 are general, and do not depend on these particular numerical\nsimulations.\nThe long lever arm associated with the strong field is able to brake the rotation of the\ninfalling gas so efficiently that the azimuthal velocity goes to zero at the origin. In other\nwords, the infalling gas spirals directly into the center without the formation of a centrifugally\nsupported disk. Although this conclusion rigorously holds only for the particular class of\ncollapse models considered in this paper, the assumption of self-similarity helps to brings out\nthe dependence of our results on the fundamental physical parameters of the problem, like\nthe cloud's mass-to-flux ratio and rotation rate, suggesting a broader validity of our main\nconclusions. Thus, the catastrophic magnetic braking discussed in Sect. 6, for example, does\nnot depend on the particular choice of the outer collapse solution but follows directly from\nthe ideal MHD equations. This work therefore proves that magnetic field dissipation is a\ncrucial ingredient to allow the formation of the circumstellar disks observed around young\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nstars. It also yields departure points for calculations which include outflow in the presence\nof inflow (Lizano et al. 2006, in preparation) or modifications introduced by the effects of\nfinite resistivity (Shu et al. 2006).\nDG and SL acknowledge financial support from the Theoretical Institute for Advanced\nResearch in Astrophysics (TIARA), CRyA/UNAM, DGAPA/UNAM and CONACyT (Mexico), and INAF-Osservatorio Astrofisico di Arcetri (Italy), where part of the research presented in this paper was done.
