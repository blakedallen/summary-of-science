Introduction\nM\u00fcller et al.1 showed that in presence of constant external electromagnetic fields\nthe Heisenberg-Euler effective potential of QED can be cast in the form of a thermal\nbackground characterized by a spectral density of states \u03c1(E) and temperature TM\neE\nav\nm2\nln(E 2 \u2212 m2 + i\u01eb),\nTM =\n=\n.\n(1)\n8\u03c0 2\nm\u03c0\n\u03c0\nSince an electric field accelerates all charged particles, real or virtual, this can\nbe understood as a property of the vacuum under constant global acceleration2\nav = eE/m. This circumstance has also been discussed by Pauchy Hwang and\nKim.3\nAssociated with this result is the quantum statistics: spin-1/2 QED exhibits a\nthermal distribution as though the fluctuating degrees of freedom are bosons, while\nspin-0 scalar QED exhibits vacuum fluctuations as though the degrees of freedom\nare fermionic. The former result could be understood as being due to pairing of\nelectron-positron pairs. However the latter case has no obvious explanation.\nThe case of 'accelerated vacuum' parallels that of an 'accelerated observer' traveling in a matter- and field-free spacetime. This observer sees a thermal background\ncharacterized by the Unruh temperature\n\u03c1(E) =\n\nTM\naU\n=\n.\n(2)\n2\u03c0\n2\nThe statistics of the thermal distribution are bosonic considering the vacuum of a\nscalar particle4,5 and fermionic in the vacuum of a fermi particle.6 Many readers\nTU =\n\n\fNovember 9, 2018\n\n10:47\n\nWSPC - Proceedings Trim Size: 9.75in x 6.5in\n\nLabun \u0307LeCosPA12f\n\n2\n\nwill expect that there should not be a difference between 'accelerated vacuum' and\n'accelerated observer', yet there is a disagreement in relation to particle spin and\nstatistics and the value of the temperatures Eq. (1) & Eq. (2).\nWe will show that these two results Eq. (1) & Eq. (2) are experimentally distinguishable. This implies the ability to determine which is accelerated, the observer\nor the vacuum state. The question is whether or not one should be able in-principle\nto determine the accelerated state within the current formulation of quantum field\ntheory. If the conclusion is that one should not be able to determine which is accelerated, then there is additional undiscovered physics content in either the vacuum\nstructure or the Unruh accelerated detector.\nIt is of considerable interest to find a model achieving agreement in the quasithermal properties of the quantum vacuum, in the sense that the accelerated observer registers the same outcome as the 'accelerated' field-filled vacuum. The disagreement in relation to particle spin suggests a closer look at the spin properties of\nthe fluctuations. Altering the magnetic moment of the electron from its Dirac value\ndescribed by the gyromagnetic ratio g = 2 to the 'classical' spinning-particle value\ng = 1 achieves agreement with the Unruh temperature and statistics.7 We summarize the results obtained and consider the properties of QED vacuum condensate\nh\u03c8\u0304\u03c8i in presence of strong quasi-constant external fields in the thermal framework\nmodeled by the 'classical' g = 1 QED.\n2. Effective Action\nCharge convective current and spin magnetic dipole current are conserved independently and thus in QED the associated integral 'charges' - the electric charge and\nmagnetic dipole moment can be prescribed arbitrarily. The gyromagnetic ratio g\ncombines with particle charge and mass in defining the magnitude of the magnetic\ndipole moment. The dynamics of a particle \u03c8 with general g is generated by\n\u0015\n\u0014\ng e\u03c3\u03bc\u03bd F \u03bc\u03bd\n\u03c8=0\n(3)\nD 2 + m2 \u2212\n2\n2\nwhere D = i\u2202+eA is the covariant derivative, F \u03bc\u03bd the electromagnetic field strength\ntensor and \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd = (i/2)[\u03b3\u03bc , \u03b3\u03bd ]. Only for the specific case g = 2 can one choose to\nwrite this in the Dirac equation form. Any value of the gyromagnetic ratio g can\narise, and as long as the quantization of charge is not understood, it is difficult\nto claim that the value of g arising in a specific simplified dynamical equation is\nof greater interest than other values. Like charge, g is the subject of experimental\nand theoretical effort to determine quantum corrections to an input value, the best\nknown being the QED correction to the Dirac particle g = 2 + \u03b1/\u03c0 + . . ..\nThe effect of g on vacuum fluctuations is determined from the effective potential\n\u0015\n\u0014\ng e\u03c3\u03bc\u03bd F \u03bc\u03bd\ni\n(4)\nVeff = \u2212 tr ln D2 + m2 \u2212\n2\n2\n2\nFor the Heisenberg-Euler case of a constant electric-only field of strength E, we\n\n\fNovember 9, 2018\n\n10:47\n\nWSPC - Proceedings Trim Size: 9.75in x 6.5in\n\nLabun \u0307LeCosPA12f\n\n3\n\nevaluate the trace using the proper time method8\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ \u221e\ng\n2\n\u03b3s\ndu eEu cosh( 2 eEu)\n\u2212\n1\ne\u2212im u\nVeff =\n2\n3\n32\u03c0 0 u\nsinh eEu\n\n(5)\n\nin which the generalized degeneracy \u03b3s counts the number and type of degrees of\nfreedom. \u03b3s = 4 when g = 2 for spin-1/2 Dirac electron, or \u03b3s = \u22122 when g = 0\nfor a spin-0 electron.

Observable Effects from g = 1\nOne observable effect is spontaneous pair production in strong fields discussed by us\nearlier,7 and originating in the imaginary part of the effective action Eq. (6). This\nallows any non-vanishing electric field to spontaneously decay into charged particle\npairs. g = 0, 2 yield the largest total decay probability and are in this sense the best\ncases for experiment. For g = 1 the reduction in the effective temperature parameter\nis largest. Due to the exponential dependence, the reduction in the temperature\nparameter by factor 2 reduces spontaneous pair production below the critical field\nEc = m2 /e by many orders of magnitude.\nThe real part of the effective potential generates nonlinear field-field interactions.\nThese interactions are exhibited order-by-order in the field by expanding Veff in a\n(semi-convergent) power series in (eE)2n . The power series representation of Veff is\nobtained by expanding the proper time integrand of Eq. (5) for eEu \u226a 1\n\u001a\u0012\n\u0013\n15 2 45 4 1 (eE)4\n\u03b3s\n7\n\u2212\n(17)\ng\n+\ng\nVeff \u2243\n32\u03c0 2\n2\n48\n45 m4\n\u0012\n\u0013\n31 49 2\n4 (eE)6\n35 4\n7 6\n+\n\u2212 g +\ng \u2212\ng\n+ ...\n24 32\n128\n512\n315 m8\nAt each order in (eE)2 , we have separated the numerical coefficients for g = 2 outside\nthe parentheses for ease of comparison to the g = 1 result,\n\u001a\n31 (eE)6\n7 (eE)4\n\u03b3s\n\u2212\n...\n(18)\n\u2243\nVeff\n5760 m4\n161280 m8\ng=1 32\u03c0 2\nFor example, the ratio of the coefficients of the (eE)4 terms is Veff (g = 1)/Veff (g =\n2) \u2243 7/128. We see that nonlinear field-field interactions generated by this potential\nare suppressed in the g = 1 case relative to the g = 2 (or g = 0) electron. This\noutcome is consistent with the suppression of the imaginary part of Veff . Experiments seeking nonlinear field effects10,11 derived from the Euler-Heisenberg effective\npotential are thus also sensitive to the effective value of g.\n5. Discussion and conclusions\nIn summary, we have recalled that in a constant electric field E, the electron fluctuations h\u03c8\u0304\u03c8i display a thermal Bose spectrum with temperature TM = eE/m\u03c0 = av /\u03c0\nEq. (14). This result contrasts with the Fermi spectrum and Unruh temperature\nTU = aU /2\u03c0 expected from viewing the vacuum fluctuations of the electrons as\naccelerated. We have calculated h\u03c8\u0304\u03c8i in an electric field for the gyromagnetic ratio\ng = 0, 1, 2. Setting g = 1, as though considering the quantum fluctuations of a\n'classical spinning particle', displays the Unruh TU = a/2\u03c0 and a Fermi spectrum,\nsee Eq. (16).\nWe highlight the functional dependence of light-light scattering on g because it\nhas implications for future experiments. Any (effective) value of g deviating from\nthe Dirac value g = 2 results in a suppression of the rate of light-light scattering.\n\n\fNovember 9, 2018\n\n10:47\n\nWSPC - Proceedings Trim Size: 9.75in x 6.5in\n\nLabun \u0307LeCosPA12f\n\n6\n\nWe note that QED is not yet tested near the critical field strength Ec = m2 /e,\nand in this strong-field regime, we have still to validate the approach to calculating\nEq. (5), which is perturbative in \u03b1.12 Even more to the point there are serious\nquestions about validity of QED in this limit.13 Therefore, the connection which\nwe established to reconcile the two ways of viewing acceleration could forebear\nforthcoming theoretical developments.\nAn observable, physical difference such as now predicted in Eqs. (2) and (1)\nprovides an in-principle test to determine whether the strong field theory is valid,\nand/or it is the observer or the vacuum that is accelerated. Being able to determine\nwho is accelerated means a fixed reference frame has been selected and defined as\ninertial. In quantum theory, the quantum vacuum state is a natural candidate for\nthe fixed reference frame,13 and here we have recalled that the electron condensate\ncontains in its definition Eq. (10) a specific vacuum state as reference. Experimental observation of quantum vacuum phenomena such as light-light scattering offers\nan important test of our understanding of the vacuum state canonically selected\nin quantum field theory and may reveal whether or not it is consistent with the\nvacuum selected in the Unruh accelerated detector situation.\nAcknowledgments: L.L. thanks Director Pisin Chen for the opportunity to visit\nLeCosPA.
