If K/F is\nany field extension of F , Br(K/F ) denotes the kernel of the restriction map\nBr(F ) \u2192 Br(K), and Brn (K/F ) = Br(K/F ) \u2229 Brn (F ). In addition the Dec\ngroup of K/F denoted by Dec(K/F ) is the subgroup of Br(K/F ) generated by\n\u222a Br(L/F ) where the union ranges over the cyclic subextensions L/F of K/F.\nIf F is a field containing a primitive nth root of unity \u03c9 and a, b \u2208 F \u2217 .\nA\u03c9 (a, b) will denote the symbol algebra over F with generators i, j satisfying\nin = a, j n = b, ij = \u03c9ji. Furthermore, when there is no risk of confusion,\nA\u22121 (a, b) will be denoted by (a, b).\nIn addition assume that F contains a primitive nth root of unity with\nn = exp(D), then it is also known that if l(D) denotes the minimum number of\nsymbols required to represent the Brauer class of D (recall that such an integer\nexists by the Merkurjev-Suslin Theorem), then n(D) \u2264 l(D). Also, numerous\nexamples of division algebras of prime exponent have been constructed by several authors with n(D) < l(D), [see e.g., Ja, Sa, Ti3 ].Note that indecomposable\ndivision algebras satisfy the inequality. At the heart of many of these examples,\n1 The results of this paper will be included in the Author PhD's dissertation. The author\nis very thankful to his advisor Dr. Morandi for his guidance. The author would also like to\nthank his Mathematical grandfather Dr. A. Wadsworth for his suggestions on improving the\nresults of this paper.\n\n1\n\n\flies the obstruction between the relative Brauer group and the Dec group. The\naim of this paper is to study this obstruction for global fields. If K/F is a finite\nabelian Galois extension of global fields whose Galois group has exponent t, we\ndefine what is called a bad prime of F, then prove that there exists a short exact\nc\nsequence 0 \u2212\u2192 Dec(K/F ) \u2212\u2192 Brt (K/F ) \u2212\u2192 \u2295 dqq Z/Z \u2212\u2192 0 where cq and\nbad q\u2032 s\n\ndq are positive integers with cq |dq . Observing that F has no bad primes when\nt is square free, we deduce that Dec(K/F ) = Brt (K/F ) whenever t is square\nfree. Note that the special case (t = 2) of this result was proved using quadratic\nform theory [ELTW, Corollary 3.18]. We use this result to show that if L is\na Henselian valued field containing a primitive pth root of unity whose residue\nfield is a global field, then any exponent p division algebra over L is isomorphic\nto a tensor product of degree p symbol algebras. The last part of this paper is\ndevoted to constructing a counterexample that shows that non square free exponent division algebras over the class of fields studied may not be isomorphic to\na product of symbol algebras. In fact, we construct an example of an exponent\n4 division algebra over Q(i)((x))((y)) that is not isomorphic to a product of\nsymbol algebras of exponent dividing 4.\nIf F is a global field, P a prime of F and D is an F -algebra rFP /F (D) +\nD \u2297F FP will be denoted by DP .\n\n1\n\nThe Dec group of finite abelian Galois extensions over global fields\n\nWe start this section by the following easy lemma.\nLemma 1.1. Let K/F a finite abelian Galois extension with galois group G. If\nt denotes the exponent of G, then Dec(K/F ) \u2286 Brt (K/F )\nProof. Since Dec(K/F ) is generated by the relative Brauer groups Br(L/F )\nwhere L/F runs over cyclic subextensions of K/F, it is enough to show that\nBr(L/F ) \u2286 Brt (K/F ) for every L/F cyclic subextensions of K/F. Note that for\nany such cyclic extension L/F, as G(L/F ) is a quotient group of G, then [L :\nF ] = |G(L/F )| = exp(G(L/F )) divides exp(G) = t. Therefore if D \u2208 Br(L/F ),\nthen exp(D) divides Ind(D) which divides [L : F ], hence exp(D) divides t. Thus\nfor every cyclic subextension L/F of K/F, Br(L/F ) \u2286 Brt (K/F ), therefore\nDec(K/F ) \u2286 Brt (K/F ).\nFor local fields, the inclusion above is an equality as we now show.\nProposition 1.2. Let F = R, C, or a local field, K/F a finite abelian Galois\nextension whose Galois group has exponent s. Then Dec(K/F ) = Brs (K/F ).\nProof. We only need to prove that Brs (K/F ) \u2286 Dec(K/F ). If F = R or C, then\nK = R or C, and in either case the inclusion is obvious. Suppose that F is a\nlocal field and let D \u2208 Brs (K/F ). Note that there exists a cyclic subextension\nL/F of K/F of degree s (for example, if G(K/F ) = Zs \u00d7 Zt2 \u00d7 ... \u00d7 Ztm , take\n2\n\n\fL = F (Zt2 \u00d7 ... \u00d7 Ztm )). Therefore Ind(D) = exp(D) divides t = [L : F ], hence\nby [Re, Corollary 31.10], D \u2208 Br(L/F ) \u2286 Dec(K/F ), thus D \u2208 Dec(K/F ) as\nneeded.\nLemma 1.3. Let F a global field, P a non-archimedian prime of F , 0 \u2264 r \u2264 n,\nand let L/F be a cyclic extension such that [LP : FP ] = n. If \u03c3 denotes a\ngenerator for G(LP /FP ), then there exists b \u2208 FP so that InvP ((LP /FP , \u03c3, b)) =\nr\nn + Z.\nProof. Recall (see, e.g., [Re,]) that InvP : Br(FP ) \u2192 Q/Z is an isomorphism,\ntherefore there exists A \u2208 Br(F ) so that InvP (A) = nr + Z. But this implies that\nInvP (An ) = Z, therefore An \u223c 1, hence Ind(A) = exp(A) divides n = [LP : FP ].\nThus A \u2208 Br(LP /FP ), and by [Dr, Theorem 1 pp.71], there exists b \u2208 FP so\nthat A \u223c (LP /FP , \u03c3, b), therefore InvP ((LP /FP , \u03c3, b)) = InvP (A) = nr + Z.\nWe set up the notations for the remaining of this section. F is a global field\nand K/F is a finite abelian Galois extension with Galois group G of exponent\nK/F\nt. For any prime q of F , Gq\ndenotes the local Galois group G(Kq /Fq ) which\nwe will simply denote by Gq when there is no risk of consfusion. Also denote by\ncq the exponent of Gq and dq := gcd(t, |Gq |). Note that as Gq is isomorphic to\na subgroup of G, then exp(Gq ) divides exp(G), but also exp(Gq ) divides |Gq |,\nhence cq divides dq . We call a prime q bad if cq < dq .\nRemark 1.4. If q is a bad prime of F, then Gq is not cyclic, therefore q is\nramified because if q is unramified, then Gq \u223c\n= G(K/F ) which is cyclic. But\nsince there are only finitely many ramified primes, it follows that there are only\nfinitely many bad primes.\nWe need the following group theoretic results in Proposition 1.7 below.\nProposition 1.5. Let G a finite abelian group of exponent t. Then there exist\nan integer n \u2265 1, a family {Hi }ni=1 of cyclic subgroups of G of order t, and a\nsubgroup D of G such that G/D is cyclic of order t satisfying H1 *H2 * * * Hn = G\nand Hi * D = G for all i.\nProof. Write G = Zt \u00d7Zt2 \u00d7...\u00d7Ztn with ti |t for all i and set D = Zt2 \u00d7...\u00d7Ztn ,\nthen G/D is cyclic of order t. Let \u03c3, \u03c3 2 , ..., \u03c3 n be the generators of Zt , Zt2 , ..., Ztn\nrespectively. For each i = 2, ..., n, set Hi = h\u03c3\u03c3 \u22121\ni i and H1 = Zt .To see that all\nthe required properties are satisfied, first let H = H1 * H2 * * * Hn , then H is a\nsubgroup of G containing \u03c3 and \u03c3\u03c3 \u22121\nfor all i, hence H contains \u03c3 and \u03c3 i for\ni\nall i, therefore H = G. In addition, it is clear that H1 * D = G, and for each\ni > 2, Hi * D contains \u03c3\u03c3 \u22121\nand \u03c3 j for all j > 2, thus Hi * D contains \u03c3 and \u03c3 j\ni\nfor all j > 2, therefore Hi * D = G for all i.\nDualizing the previous Proposition, we get:\nCorollary 1.6. Let G a finite abelian group of exponent t. Then there exist\nan integer n \u2265 1, a family {Hi }ni=1 of subgroups of G with G/Hi cyclic of\norder t for each i, and there exists a cyclic subgroup D of G of order t satisfying\nH1 \u2229 H2 \u2229 * * * \u2229 Hn = (1) and Hi \u2229 D = (1) for all i.\n3\n\n\f\u223c G(:=\nb\nb\nProof. Since G =\nHomZ (G, Q/Z)), it is enough to prove the result for G.\nA way to justify the previous isomorphism is to observe that the isomorphism is\ntrivial for cyclic groups, and appeal to the fundamental theorem of finite abelian\ngroups together with the fact that HomZ (\u2212, Q/Z) preserves direct products.\nNow note that G has subgroups {Hi }ni=1 and D as in Proposition 1.5. For\neach i = 1, ..., n, set Ki = Hi\u22a5 and D\u2032 = D\u22a5 (recall that if H is a subgroup\nb On the\nof G, then H \u22a5 := {f : G \u2192 Q/Z; H \u2286 ker f } is a subgroup of G).\n\u22a5 \u223c c \u223c\nb\nb\nother hand, for each i, G/Hi = Hi = Hi , so for each i, G/Ki is cyclic of\norder t. In addition, for each i, D\u22a5 \u2229 Hi\u22a5 = (D * Hi )\u22a5 = G\u22a5 = (1), and\nn\nn\n\\\n\\\nKi = (1) and Ki \u2229D\u2032 = (1)\nHi\u22a5 = (H1 *H2 * * * Hn )\u22a5 = G\u22a5 = (1), therefore\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\nfor each i as needed.\n\nCorollary 1.6 and the Tchebotarev Density Theorem now yield:\nProposition 1.7. Let F a global field and K/F a finite abelian Galois extension with Galois group G of exponent t. Then there exists cyclic subextensions\n{Li /F }ni=1 of K/F of degree t so that K = L1 ...Ln and there exists infinitely\nmany P of F so that [LiP : FP ] = t for all i.\nProof. G has subgroups {Hi }ni=1 and D as in Corollary 1.6. For each i let Li =\nF (Hi ), then G(Li /F ) \u223c\n= G/Hi , therefore Li /F is cyclic of degree t. On the other\nhand, G(K/(L1 ...Ln )) \u2286 G(K/Li ) = Hi for all i, therefore G(K/(L1 ...Ln )) \u2286\nn\n\n\u2229 Hi = (1), hence G(K/(L1 ...Ln )) = (1), thus K = L1 ...Ln . Let \u03c3 be a gener-\n\ni=1\n\nator of D, by the Tchebotarev Density Theorem [Pi, p363], there are infinitely\nK/F\nmany primes P of F so that GP\n= h\u03c3i. For each of these primes P,and\nK/F\nK/Li\n= (GP ) \u2229 Hi = D \u2229 Hi = (1) by Corollary 1.6,therefore\neach i, GP\nK/L\nfor each i, [KP : LiP ] = |GP i | = 1. In addition, as \u03c3 has order t, then\nt = [KP : FP ] = [KP : LiP ][LiP : FP ] = [LiP : FP ], thus [LiP : FP ] = t for all i\nas needed.\nFrom now and for the rest of this section F will be a global field, K/F a finite\nabelian Galois extension with cyclic subextensions {Li /F }ni=1 as in Proposition\n1.7.\nRemark 1.8. Let G be a finite abelian group, {Hi }ni=1 subgroups of G with\nn\n\n\u2229 Hi = (1) and G/Hi cyclic for each i. Then exp(G) = lcm{|G/Hi |}. To see\n\ni=1\n\nn\n\nb = hH \u22a5 i, hence exp(G) = exp(G)\nb =\nthis, note that since \u2229 Hi = (1), then G\ni\ni=1\n\nlcm{exp(Hi\u22a5 )} = lcm{|G/Hi |}. The last equality holds because for each i,\nG/Hi \u223c\n= Hi\u22a5 and G/Hi is cyclic.\nIn particular if q is a prime of F and Gq = G(Kq /Fq ), let Hi = G(Kq /Liq )\nfor each i, then Gq /Hi \u223c\n= G(Liq /Fq ) and Gq /Hi is cyclic for each i. As K =\nn\n\nL1 ...Ln , then Kq = L1q ...Lnq , hence \u2229 Hi = (1). Therefore, by the above\ni=1\n\n4\n\n\fcq := exp(Gq ) = lcm{|Gq /Hi |} = lcm{[Liq : Fq ]}. Thus for each prime q,\ncq = lcm{[Liq : Fq ]}.\nRemark 1.9. If K = L1 ...Ln as in Proposition 1.7, then Dec(K/F ) = hBr(Li /F ) :\ni = 1, ...ni. To see this, note that in [Ti1 , Lemme 1.3] all that is needed for the\nargument is that the \u03c7i generate the character group \u03c7(K/F ), and this is equivalent to the Li generating K as fields which is our assumption.\nExample 1.10. An example of a finite\n\u221a \u221aabelian Galois extension with a bad\nprime. Consider F = Q(i), K = F ( 5, 4 14) and q an extension of the 5 adic\nvaluation v5 on Q to F. We claim that G \u223c\n= Z2 \u00d7 Z2 , and\n= Z4 \u00d7 Z2 and Gq \u223c\nthis would imply that q is a bad prime of F (cq = 2 < 4 = dq ). Using the fact\n4\nthat 7 is prime in Z[i], and\nthe Eisenstein Criterion, one sees that\n14 is\n\u221a x \u2212\u221a\n\u221a\n4\n= 4 . It is also easy to see that 5 \u2208\n/ F ( 4 14)\nirreducible over F, so [F ( \u221a14) : F ] \u221a\n/\u221aQ( 4 14) ), thus\n(this is true just because 5 \u2208\n\u221a |G| = [K : F ] = 8, in addition\nsince K is the composite of F ( 4\u221a14) and F ( 5) which\nare linearly disjoint over\n\u221a\nF, then G := G(K/F ) = G(F ( 4 14)/F ) \u2295 G(F ( 5)/F ), hence \u221a\nG \u223c\n=\u221aZ4 \u00d7 Z2 .\n4\n\u223c\n5,\n14), and\nZ\n\u00d7\nZ\n.\nFirst\nwe\nhave\nK\n=\nF\n(\nIt remains to see that\nG\n=\n2\n2\nq\nq\nq\n\u221a\n\u221a\n4\nwe assert that Fq ( 14) = Fq ( 2). To see the last assertion, note first that\nas v5 has two extensions to F (5 \u2261 1(mod\n4)), then F = Z5 ; in addition let\np\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n4\n2\n4\n4\nL = F ( 14), then L = F ( 14) = Z5 ( 2 ) = \u221aZ5 ( 2), hence as Lq /Fq is\nunramified, [Lq : Fq ] = [L\n\u221aq : Fq ] = [L : F ] = [Z5 ( 2) : Z5 ] = 2. On the other\nx2 \u2212 2 has a\u221a root in L\u221aq , therefore by the\nhand, as Lq = L\n\u221a = Z5 ( 2), then\n\u221a\n4\nHensel Lemma,\n2 \u2208\u221aLq = Fq ( 14), hence Fq ( 2) \u2286 Fq ( 4 14) and\n\u221a\n\u221a by\u221adegree\ncount Fq ( 2) = Fq ( 4 14) as claimed. Finally we have\u221aKq = Fq ( 5, 4 14) =\n\u221a \u221a\nFq ( 5,\n\u221a 2). We show\u221athat [Kq : Fq ] = 4. Note that 2 \u2208 Kq , so [Kq : Fq ]\n>[Fq ( 2) : FP ]=[Z5 ( 2) : Z5 ]= 2. In addition 21 + Z \u2208 \u0393Kq /\u0393Fq (being the\n\u221a\ncoset of the value of 5), then [\u0393Kq : \u0393Fq ] \u2265 2.

Let D \u2208 Br(F ), then D \u2208 Dec(K/F ) if and only if DP \u2208\nDec(KP /FP ) for all primes P of F .\nProof. It is obvious that D \u2208 Dec(K/F ) implies DP \u2208 Dec(KP /FP ) for all\nprimes P of F .\nConversely, suppose DP \u2208 Dec(KP /FP ) for all primes P of F . Recall that by\nProposition 1.7, there exists cyclic subextensions {Li /F }ni=1 of K/F of degree\nt so that K = L1 ...Ln and there exists infinitely many P of F so that [LiP :\nFP ] = t for all i. Recall also that there is a well-known short exact sequence [see\nfor example Re, 32.13]:\n\u2295rF\n\n\u2295 InvF\n\n/F\n\nP\n0 \u2212\u2192 Br(F ) \u2212\u2192\n\u2295 Br(FP ) \u2212\u2192 P Q/Z \u2212\u2192 0\n\nP\n\n5\n\n(S)\n\n\fLet {P1 , ..., Pm } be the support of D. By assumption, DPj \u2208 Dec(KPj /FPj )\nfor all j = 1, ..., m. Since for each j, KPj = L1Pj ...LnPj , then by Remark ?? and\n[Dr, Th. 1 pp.73], for each j, there exist b1j , ..., bnj \u2208 FP\u2217j such that\nn\n\nDPj \u223c \u2297 (LiPj /FPj , \u03c3 ij , bij ).\n\n(1)\n\ni=1\n\nt\n\nFor each i = 1, ..., n and j = 1, ..., m, write InvPj [(LiPj /FPj , \u03c3 ij , bij )] = sij\n+Z\nij\nwith gcd(tij , sij ) = 1. Then exp[(LiPj /FPj , \u03c3 ij , bij )] = sij for all i, j. But as\n[LiPj : FPj ] divides t for all i, j, then (LiPj /FPj , \u03c3 ij , bij )\u2297t \u223c 1 for all i, j; thus sij\ndivides t for all i, j. Therefore, for each i = 1, ..., n, there exists 0 \u2264 ti < t so that\nm\nX\nInvPj [(LiPj /FPj , \u03c3 ij , bij )] = tti + Z. For each i = 1, ..., n, set ri = t \u2212 ti . Then\nj=1\n\nby Proposition 1.7 there exists a non-Archimedean prime P\u2217 \u2208\n/ {P1 , ..., Pm } so\nthat [LiP\u2217 : FP\u2217 ] = t for each i = 1, ..., n. Then by Lemma 1.3, there exists b\u2217i \u2208\nFP\u2217 so that InvP\u2217 [(LiP\u2217 /FP\u2217 , \u03c3 i , b\u2217i )] = rti + Z. Therefore, for each i = 1, ..., n,\nthe element of \u2295 Br(FP ) whose Pj coordinate is (LiPj /FPj , \u03c3 ij , bij ) (j = 1, ...m),\nP\n\n/\nthe P\u2217\u2032 s coordinate is (LiP\u2217 /FP\u2217 , \u03c3 i , b\u2217i ), and the P \u2032 s coordinate is FP for P \u2208\n{P1 , ..., Pm , P\u2217 } is in the kernel of the map \u2295 InvFP .

This holds trivially\ni=1\n\nfor primes P \u2208\n/ {P1 , ..., Pm , P\u2217 } and easily for primes P \u2208 {P1 , ..., Pm } using\nn\n\nthe relations (1) and (2). On the other hand, ( \u2297 Ai ) \u2297 Dop has invariants Z\nn\n\ni=1\n\neverywhere except possibly at P\u2217 , but as ( \u2297 Ai ) \u2297 Dop \u2208 Br(F ), the exactness\ni=1\n\nn\n\nof the sequence (S) implies that the sum of all the invariants of ( \u2297 Ai ) \u2297 Dop\nn\n\ni=1\n\nis Z, hence its invariant at P\u2217 must also be Z. Therefore ( \u2297 Ai ) \u2297 Dop \u223c 1,\ni=1\n\nand Claim 1 follows.\nClaim 2: Ai \u2208 Br(Li /F ) for each i = 1, ..., n.\nAgain, we just need to prove this locally at each prime of F . Let i = 1, ..., n\nand P a prime of F ; if P = Pj \u2208 {P1 , ..., Pm }, then AiPj \u223c (LiPj /FPj , \u03c3 ij , bij ),\ntherefore AiPj \u2208 Br(LiPj /FPj ). If P = P\u2217 , then AiP\u2217 \u223c (LiP\u2217 /FP\u2217 , \u03c3 i , b\u2217i ), so\n/ {P1 , ..., Pm , P\u2217 }, then AiP \u223c 1 and the result\nAiP\u2217 \u2208 Br(LiP\u2217 /FP\u2217 ). If P \u2208\nholds trivially.\n6\n\n\fRemark 1.12. Let D \u2208 Brt (K/F ), then for any prime q of F, Dq \u2208 Brt (Kq /Fq ).\nWrite Invq (Dq ) = rs + Z with gcd(r, s) = 1, then Ind(Dq ) = exp(Dq ) = s, therefore s divides t and [Kq : Fq ], hence s divides dq . Therefore D \u2208 Brt (K/F )\n\u2032\nimplies for each prime q of F , Invq (Dq ) = rs + Z = drq + Z \u2208 d1q Z/Z. On\nthe other hand if D \u2208 Dec(K/F ), then Dq \u2208 Dec(Kq /Fq ) for all primes q\nof F. But since Kq = L1q * * * Lnq , then by Remark ?? Dq \u223c A1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 An\nwith Ai \u2208 Br(Liq /Fq ) for each i. Hence for each i, exp(Ai ) = Ind(Ai ) divides\n[Liq : Fq ], thus for each prime q, exp(Dq ) divides lcm(exp(Ai )) which divides\nnq\nlcm[Liq : Fq ] = cq [Remark 1.8]. But as Invq (Dq ) = exp(D\n+ Z for some integer\nq)\nn\u2032\n\nnq , it follows that for each prime q, Invq (Dq ) = cqq + Z for some integer n\u2032q .\nTherefore D \u2208 Dec(K/F ) implies for each prime q of F , Invq (Dq ) \u2208 c1q Z/Z.\nThe following is the main result of this paper.\nTheorem 1.13. Let K/F a finite abelian Galois extension of global fields whose\nGalois group G := G(K/F ) has exponent t. Then there is a short exact sequence\nf\n\ng\n\n0 \u2212\u2192 Dec(K/F ) \u2212\u2192 Brt (K/F ) \u2212\u2192\n\n\u2295\n\nbad\n\nq\u2032 s\n\ncq\nZ/Z \u2212\u2192 0\ndq\n\nwhere f is the inclusion map [Lemma 1.1].\nProof. By Remark 1.12, there is a group homomorphism \u03c6 : Brt (K/F ) \u2212\u2192\n\u2295 d1q Z/Z defined by \u03c6([D]) = {Invq (Dq )}bad q\u2032 s and the restriction \u03c6 of\n\nbad q\u2032 s\n\n\u03c6 to Dec(K/F ) is a group homomorphism Dec(K/F ) \u2212\u2192\n\n\u2295\n\nbad q\u2032 s\n\n1\ncq Z/Z.\n\nLet\n\nK = ker \u03c6. We assert that K \u2286 Dec(K/F ). To see this, let D \u2208 K, then D \u2208\nBrt (K/F ) and Invq (Dq ) = Z for each bad prime q. So for each bad prime q,\nDq \u223c 1. But on the other hand since D \u2208 Brt (K/F ), then for each prime q,\nDq \u2208 Brt (Kq /Fq ). Two cases can be considered:\nCase 1: If q is a bad prime, then Dq \u223c 1 \u2208 Dec(Kq /Fq ).\nCase 2: If q is not a bad prime, then as Dq \u2208 Brt (Kq /Fq ), then exp(Dq ) =\nInd(Dq ) divides dq , hence Dq \u2208 Brdq (Kq /Fq ) = Brcq (Kq /Fq ) = Dec(Kq /Fq ).\nThe last equality is Proposition 1.2, therefore Dq \u2208 Dec(Kq /Fq ) for all primes\nq of F, hence by Proposition 1.11, D \u2208 Dec(K/F ). We obtain the following\ncommutative diagram where the vertical arrows are inclusion maps.\n\u03c6\n\n0\u2192 K\n\n\u2212\u2192 Dec(K/F ) \u2212\u2192\n\n||\n0\u2192 K\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\n\u2193\u03b1\nBrt (K/F )\n\n\u03c6\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\n\u2295\n\nbad q\u2032 s\n\n\u2295\n\n1\ncq Z/Z\n\n\u2193\u03b2\n\nbad q\u2032 s\n\n1\ndq Z/Z\n\n\u21920\n\u21920\n\nWe show that the rows of the diagram are short exact sequences. But the\nonly thing to show is that the maps \u03c6 and \u03c6 are surjective. Let (rq )bad q\u2032 s \u2208\nt\n\u2295 d1q Z/Z, then for each bad prime q, rq = dqq + Z for some integer tq. Recall\nbad q\u2032 s\n\nthat by Remark 1.4, there are only finitely many bad primes, let d = lcm{dq : q\n7\n\n\fbad prime}. On the other hand, by Proposition 1.7, there exists a prime P of\nF that is not bad so that [LiP : FP ] = t for all i = 1, ..., n. In addition, there\nexists, D \u2208 Br(F ) with:\nInvq (Dq ) =\nInvP (DP ) =\nInvq (Dq ) =\nX t\nq\nwhere n\u2032 = \u2212d\ndq .\n\ntq\n+Z\nfor each bad prime q\ndq\nn\u2032\n+Z\nd\nZ\nfor q \u2208\n/ {bad primes, P }\n\nbad q\u2032 s\n\nClaim: D \u2208 Brt (K/F ) and \u03c6([D]) = (rq ).\nNote that for each bad prime q, dq divides t, therefore d divides t. Also for\neach prime q (bad or not), o(Invq (Dq )) divides d (where o(Invq (Dq )) denotes\nthe order of Invq (Dq ) in Q/Z), so lcm{o(Invq (Dq )) : q \u2208 {bad primes, P }}\ndivides d, hence as exp(D) = lcm{o(Invq (Dq )) : q \u2208 {bad primes, P }}, then\nexp(D) divides d, thus exp(D) divides t. It remains to show that D \u2208 Br(K/F ),\nor equivalently Dq \u2208 Br(Kq /Fq ) for all primes q of F which we now show by\nconsidering the following cases.\nCase 1: If q is a bad prime, Ind(Dq ) = o(Invq (Dq )) divides dq and dq divides\n|Gq | = [Kq : Fq ], thus Dq \u2208 Br(Kq /Fq ).\nCase 2: If q = P, then Ind(DP ) = o(InvP (DP )) divides d and d divides\nt = [L1P : FP ], so t divides [Kq : Fq ], thus Ind(DP ) divides [Kq : Fq ], hence\nDq \u2208 Br(Kq /Fq ).\nCase 3: If q \u2208\n/ {bad primes, P }, then Dq \u223c 1, hence Dq \u2208 Br(Kq /Fq ).\nTherefore D \u2208 Brt (K/F ), and clearly by construction of D, \u03c6([D]) =\n(rq )bad q\u2032 s .\nWe show that \u03c6 is also surjective. Let (rq )bad q\u2032 s \u2208 \u2295 c1q Z/Z. Then for\nbad q\u2032 s\n\ntq\ncq\n\neach bad prime q, rq =\n+ Z for some integer tq. Recall that by Remark 1.4,\nthere are only finitely many bad primes, let c = lcm{cq : q bad prime}. Note\nthat as cq |dq for each q, then c|d and from the above d|t, it follows that c|t. On\nthe other hand, by Proposition 1.7, there exists a prime P of F that is not bad\nso that [LiP : FP ] = t for all i = 1, ..., n. In addition, there exists, D \u2208 Br(F )\nwith\n\nInvq (Dq )\nInvP (DP )\n\ntq\n+Z\nfor each bad prime q\ncq\nm\u2032\n=\n+Z\nc\n= Z\nfor q \u2208\n/ {bad primes, P }\n=\n\nInvq (Dq )\nX t\nq\nwhere m\u2032 = \u2212c\ncq .\nbad q\u2032 s\n\n8\n\n\fClaim: D \u2208 Dec(K/F ) and \u03c6([D]) = (rq )bad q\u2032 s .\nTo show that D \u2208 Dec(K/F ), it is enough by Proposition 1.11 to show that\nDq \u2208 Dec(Kq /Fq ) for all primes q of F which we now show again by considering\nfew cases:\nCase 1: If q is a bad prime, Ind(Dq ) = o(Invq (Dq )) divides cq and cq\ndivides |Gq | = [Kq : Fq ], thus by [Re, Corollary 31.10], Dq \u2208 Brcq (Kq /Fq ) =\nDec(Kq /Fq ). The last equality follows from Proposition 1.2.\nCase 2: If q = P, then Ind(DP ) = o(InvP (DP )) divides c and c divides\nt = [L1P : FP ], so t divides [Kq : Fq ] = |Gq | (so dq = cq = t). Thus Ind(DP )\ndivides [Kq : Fq ], hence Dq \u2208 Brcq (Kq /Fq ) = Dec(Kq /Fq ) again by Proposition\n1.2.\nCase 3: If q \u2208\n/ {bad primes, P }, then Dq \u223c 1, hence Dq \u2208 Dec(Kq /Fq ).\nTherefore D \u2208 Dec(K/F ), and clearly by construction of D, \u03c6([D]) =\n(rq )bad q\u2032 s .\nBy the Snake Lemma,\nBrt (K/F )/ Dec(K/F ) \u223c\n=( \u2295\n\n1\n\nbad q\u2032 s dq\n\nZ/Z)/( \u2295\n\n1\n\nbad q\u2032 s cq\n\nZ/Z) \u223c\n=\n\n\u2295\n\ncq\n\nbad q\u2032 s dq\n\nZ/Z\n\nwhich completes the proof of the Theorem.\nCorollary 1.14. Let K/F be a finite abelian Galois extension of global fields\nwhose Galois group has a square free exponent t\nThen Dec(K/F ) = Brt (K/F )\nProof. Suppose that t is square free. Let q a prime of F, and prime number\np dividing dq , then p divides |Gq |, thus Gq has a subgroup H of order p, thus\np=exp H divides exp(Gq ) = cq . So cq and dq have the same prime factors, but\nas t is square free, so are cq and dq , thus cq = dq . Therefore F has no bad\nprimes, and by the exactness of the sequence of Theorem 1.13, Dec(K/F ) =\nBrt (K/F ).\n\n2\n\nDivision algebras over Henselian valued field\nwith residue a local or global field\n\nIn this section, we show that if F is a Henselian valued field containing a primitive pth root of unity so that F is either a local or a global field and Char(F ) 6= p,\nevery prime exponent division algebra over F is isomorphic to a product of symbol algebras. We also construct an example to show that the result does not\ngeneralize to higher exponent algebras. In this section, we will use the terminologies inertial, NSR (nicely semiramified), TR (totally ramified) division\nalgebras whose definitions and related results can be found in [JW, sections 1\nand 4]. We will also use the terminologies of gauges and armatures. A good\nreference for gauges in [TW1 ] and a good reference for armatures is [TW2 ].\n\n9\n\n\fProposition 2.1. Let F be a Henselian valued field containing a primitive pth\nroot of unity such that F is either a local or a global field with Char(F ) 6= p.\nThen for each D \u2208 Brp (F ), Ind(D) = pl(D) , or equivalently any prime exponent\ndivision algebra is isomorphic to a tensor product of symbol algebras of degree\nthe same prime.\nProof. We will prove that D is isomorphic to a product of symbols. By [Ja,\nLemma 3.4], D can be decomposed as D \u223c I \u2297 N \u2297 T where I is inertial, N\nis an NSR algebra, T is TR with \u0393N \u2229 \u0393T = \u0393F and exp(I), exp(N ), exp(T )\ndivides p. Let S \u223c I \u2297 N, the underlying division algebra of I \u2297 N. Then by\n[Mo, Theorem 1], since \u0393S \u2229 \u0393T = \u0393F , S \u2297F T is a division algebra and T\nis defectless over F , then D \u223c\n= S \u2297 T. Since T is a product of symbols [Dr2 ,\nThm1], it is enough to prove that S is a product of symbols. As the only\nprime exponent algebras over number/local fields are either split or symbols,\nwe get by [JW, Proposition 2.8] l(I) = l(I) = 0, 1. If I \u223c 0, then S is NSR and\ntherefore by [JW, Proposition 4.4], is a product of symbols. If I is a symbol,\nthen as ind(S) = ind(I N ) ind(N ) [JW, Theorem 5.15], then ind(I N ) divides p.\nTwo cases are then to be considered. If ind(I N ) = 1, then I \u2208 Brp (N /F ) =\nDec(N /F ), the last equality is Corollary 1.14;hence I \u2208 Dec(N /F ), therefore\nby [JW, Theorem 5.15], S is NSR. Finally if ind(I N ) = p, then by the formula\nind(S)=ind(I N )ind(N ), [S : F ] = [I \u2297 N : F ], thus S \u223c\n= I \u2297 N, therefore S is\na product of symbols. Consequently, D is isomorphic to a product of symbols,\nand it follows that ind(D) = pl(D) .\nRemark 2.2. The class of fields of Proposition 2.1 is the best class for which the\nresult holds in the following sense. Number fields have transcendence degree 0\nover Q, and in [ART], there is an example of an indecomposible division algebra\nof index 8 over a Henselian valued field L with L = Q(t), so by [Ti2 ,Thm1], its\nlength is 4. Proposition 2.1 is false in general for algebra of non prime exponent\nas we now show.We start by the following lemma which computes the value\ngroup of a tensor product of symbol algebras.\nLemma 2.3. Let A := \u2297m\nk=1 A\u03c9 (ak , bk ) a division algebra product of symbol\nalgebras of degree n over a Henselian field (F, v) such that char(F ) \u2224 n. If ik , jk\ndenote the standard generators of A\u03c9 (ak , bk ), then \u0393A /\u0393F = hv(ik )+\u0393F , v(jk )+\n\u0393F : k = 1, . . . , mi.\nProof. Consider the canonical armature A = h{ik F \u2217 , jk F \u2217 : k = 1, . . . , m}i \u2286A\u2217 /F \u2217 .\nThen the valuation v induces a group homomorphism ve : A \u2192\u0393A /\u0393F defined\nby ve(cF \u2217 ) = v(c) + \u0393F . For each a \u2208 A, choose in A exactly one representative\nxaP\nof the coset a; then (xa )a\u2208A is a F -basis for A. Define y : A \u2192 \u25b3 \u222a {\u221e} by\ny( a\u2208A \u03bba xa ) = min(v(\u03bba xa )). Then y is an F -gauge [TW, Proposition 4.7],\na\u2208A\n\nand \u0393A,y = Im(e\nv ). But since y is an F -gauge, by [TW, Corollary 3.4], y = v,\nthus \u0393A,v = Im(e\nv ) = \u0393A /\u0393F = hv(ik ) + \u0393F , v(jk ) + \u0393F : k = 1, . . . , mi as\nneeded.\nIn all that follows, because of using i as a generator of a symbol, we will\ndenote by \u03be the primitive 4th root of unity i in C\n10\n\n\f\u221a \u221a\nProposition 2.4. Let k = Q(\u03be) and L = k( 5, 13).Then the factor group\nBr4 (L/k)/ Dec(L/k) is a non cyclic abelian group of exponent 2.\nProof. Note since L is biquadratic, by [Ti2 ,Thm1], Dec(L/k) = Br2 (L/k).\nTherefore it is obvious that Br4 (L/k)/ Dec(L/k) is an Abelian group of exponent 2. To show that Br4 (L/k)/ Dec(L/k) is non cyclic, it is enough to\nshow that it contains more than two elements which we now proceed to do.\nMore precisely, we will prove the existence of A, B \u2208 Br4 (L/k)\\ Dec(L/k) with\nA \u2241 B mod Dec(L/k). Note that since 5 \u2261 1(mod 4) the prime 5 of Q splits\ninto two primes P1 , P2 of k, and similarly 13 splits into two primes P3 , P4 of\nk so that [LPj : kPj ] = 4 for j = 1, 2, 3, 4. To see that these degrees are\n\u221a\nall 4, let's simplify\nthe\nnotation\nand\ndenote\nP\nby\nP.\nThen\n13 \u2208 LP , so\n1\n\u221a\n\u221a\n[LP : kP ] > [kP ( 13) : kP ] = [Z5 ( 13) : Z5 ] = 2. In addition 12 + Z \u2208 \u0393LP /\u0393kP\n\u221a\n(being the coset of the value of 5), then [\u0393LP : \u0393kP ] \u2265 2. Therefore by the\nfundamental\n[LP : kP ] \u2265 [LP : kP ][\u0393LP : \u0393kP ] \u2265 4, but since\n\u221a\n\u221a inequality,\nLP = kP ( 5, 13), then[LP : kP ] \u2264 4, thus [LP : kP ] = 4 as claimed. The\nproof for P2 is identical to the one for P1 , and the proofs for P3 and P4 are\nsimilar. Now consider A, B \u2208 Br(k) with local invariants given in the table\nbelow\nP1\nP2\nP3\nP4\nall other primes\n1\n1\n1\n1\nA\nZ\n4 +Z\n4 +Z\n4 +Z\n4 +Z\n1\n1\n1\nB\nZ\nZ\n4 +Z\n4 +Z\n2 +Z\nTherefore, ind(A) = ind(B) = exp(A) = exp(B) = 4, hence as Dec(L/k) =\nBr2 (L/k) and [LPj : kPj ] = 4 j = 1, 2, 3, 4, then A, B \u2208 Br4 (L/k)\\ Dec(L/k).Finally,\nwe assert that A \u2241 B mod Dec(L/k), for otherwise there exists D\u2032 \u2208 Dec(L/k)\nwith A \u223c B \u2297 D\u2032 . But this would imply that D\u2032 has local invariants 34 + Z at P3 ,\n1\n\u2032\n4 + Z at P4 and Z at all other primes, which forces D to have index 4.But since\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nind(D ) = exp(D ), D would have exponent 4, which contradicts the fact that\nD\u2032 \u2208 Dec(L/k) = Br2 (L/k). Therefore, A \u2241 B mod Dec(L/k) as claimed.\nCorollary 2.5. There exists D1 \u2208 Br4 (L/k) with exp(D1 ) = 4 for which there\ndoes not exist D0 \u2208 Dec(L/k) with D1 \u223c A\u03be (13, 5) \u2297 D0 .\nProof. At least one of the algebras A and B of the Proof of Proposition 2.4 will\ndo as they couldn't both be congruent to A\u03be (13, 5) mod Dec(L/k).\nFor what follows, D1 will denote the algebra from Corollary 2.5 and F =\nk((x))((y)) the field of Laurent series equipped with the usual Henselian valuation v so that \u0393F = Z \u00d7 Z and F = k. Let I the inertial lift of D1 over F ; and D\nthe underlying division algebra of I\u2297F N with N denoting the NSR division algebra (5, x)\u2297F (13, y). Then \u0393N = 12 Z\u00d7 21 Z and N = L. Note that by [JW, Proposition 5.15] and the definition of D1 (See Corollary 2.5). I is split by N = L \u223c\n=D\n(so D is semiramified), \u0393D = \u0393N = 12 Z \u00d7 21 Z and ind(D) = ind(N ) = 4. In\naddition there is a group isomorphism I Br(F ) \u2212\u2192 Br(k) sending I to D1 [JW,\nTheorem 2.8]; therefore, exp(I) = exp(D1 ) = 4. Since ind(D) = 4, then exp(D)\nis 2 or 4, but since exp(I) = 4 and exp(N ) = 2, then exp(D) = 4.\n11\n\n\fTheorem 2.6. The division algebra D above has exponent 4 and is not isomorphic to a product of symbol algebras.\nProof. If D is isomorphic to a product of symbol algebras, then as Ind(D) =\nexp(D) = 4, then D is isomorphic to a single symbol division algebra A\u03be (t, s)\nof degree 4. We let i, j be the standard generators. First, we show that if D \u223c\n=\n\u22172\n2\n2\n\u223c\nA\u03be (t, s), then D = A\u03be (ax , by ) for some v-units a, b with a, b \u2208\n/ F . Note that\n1 1\n1 1\n1\n1\n{(0, 0), (0, ), ( , 0), ( , )} \u223c\n= ( Z \u00d7 Z)/(Z \u00d7 Z) \u223c\n= \u0393D /\u0393F\n2 2\n2 2\n2\n2\nSince by Lemma 2.3 \u0393D /\u0393F = hv(i) + \u0393F , v(j) + \u0393F i and \u0393D /\u0393F is not cyclic,\nthen v(i) + \u0393F 6= v(j) + \u0393F . In addition, as A\u03be (t, s) \u223c\n= A\u03be (t, \u2212ts),\n= A\u03be (s, t\u22121 ) \u223c\n1\nwe can assume v(i) + \u0393F = ( 2 , 0) + \u0393F and v(j) + \u0393F = (0, 12 ) + \u0393F . Thus,\nthere is \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393F so that v(i) = ( 12 , 0) + \u03b3, hence v(t) = (2, 0) + 4\u03b3 = v(x2 ) + 4\u03b3.\nTherefore, there exists \u03b4, a \u2208 F with a unit so that t = a\u03b4 4 x2 ; and similarly,\nthere exists \u01eb, b \u2208 F with b unit so that t = b\u01eb4 y 2 . Thus D \u223c\n= A\u03be (t, s) =\nA\u03be (a\u03b4 4 x2 , b\u01eb4 y 2 ) \u223c\n= A\u03be (ax2 , by 2 ) as claimed. In addition, if either a or b was a\n\u2217\nsquare in F , then by Hensel's lemma, a or b is a square in F , which implies\n2\nthat A\u03be (ax , bx2 ) is similar to a quaternion\n\u221a algebra and violates the exponent\n\u221a\n4 assumption. Furthermore if F ( a)=F ( b), then there exists re \u2208 F , so that\na = be\nr2 , there exists a v-unit r \u2208 F with a = Br2 ; hence D \u223c\n= A\u03be (ax2 , by 2 ) =\n2 2\n2\nA\u03be (Br x , by ) \u223c A\u03be (b, b) \u2297 (b, y)\n\u2297 (rx, b) \u223c A\u03be (b, \u22121) \u2297 (b, y) \u2297\u221a\n(rx, b) which\n\u221a \u221a\n\u221a\nis exponent 2, therefore [F ( a, b) : F ] = 4. Next note that a, b \u2208 D since\n\u221a \u221a\n\u221a \u221a\n2\n2\n2 y \u22121 . Then F ( a, b) = D because F ( a, b) \u2286 D\na = i2 x\u22121 and b = j\u221a\n\u221a \u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a \u221a\nand [D : F ] = [F ( a, b) : F ] = 4. Therefore D \u223c\n5, 13) \u223c\n= F( \u221a\n= F ( a, b).\nBut as \u03b8D = \u03b8N by JW, Prop. 5.15(a), it follows that F ( 5) = F (\u03b8N (h(0, 12 ) +\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\nZ \u00d7 Zi)) = F (\u03b8 D (h(0, 12 ) + Z \u00d7 Zi)) =F ( b). Therefore, F ( 5)=F ( b), and\n\u221a\n\u221a\ne \u2208 F so that a = 13e\ne, \u03b2\n\u03b12 and\nsimilarly F ( 13)=F ( a). Hence, there exists \u03b1\n2\ne , and by Hensel's Lemma there exists v-units \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 F so that a = 13\u03b12\nb = 5\u03b2\nand b = 5\u03b2 2 . The symbols manipulation yields\nD\n\n2\n\u223c\n= A\u03be (ax2 , by 2 ) = A\u03be (13\u03b12 x2 , 5\u03b2 y 2 )\n\u223c A\u03be (13, 5) \u2297 A\u03be (13, \u03b2 2 ) \u2297 A\u03be (13, x2 ) \u2297 A\u03be (\u03b12 , 5) \u2297 A\u03be (x2 , 5)\n\n\u223c A\u03be (13, 5) \u2297 (5, \u03b1) \u2297 (13, \u03b2) \u2297 (5, x) \u2297 (13, y)\n\u223c A\u03be (13, 5) \u2297 (5, \u03b1) \u2297 (13, \u03b2) \u2297 N\n\nBut since D \u223c I \u2297 N , it follows that I \u223c A\u03be (13, 5) \u2297 (5, \u03b1) \u2297 (13, \u03b2) and\npassing to the residue(which can be justified by JW, Examples 2.4(i), Proposition 2.5 and Theorem 2.8), we obtain D1 = I \u223c A\u03be (13, 5) \u2297 (5, \u03b1) \u2297 (13, \u03b2)\nwhich contradicts Corollary 2.5.\nRemark 2.7. In his Ph.D thesis, F. Chang studied tame division algebras over\ngeneralized local fields which are Henselian field with finite residue fields. He\n12\n\n\fwas able to prove that any tame division algebra over such field is isomorphic\nto a product of cyclic algebras. More details about these algebras can be found\nin[Ch]. Based on that result, we were curious to know whether or not we could\ngeneralized Proposition 2.1 to higher exponent division algebra, but as Theorem\n2.6 shows, this is not the case.\n\nReferences\n[ART] S.
