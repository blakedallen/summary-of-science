Differently from earlier proposals, spin transport through our device is\ntolerant against spin-independent scattering processes. Hence the requirement of strictly ballistic\ntransport can be relaxed. This follows from a unique interplay between the Dresselhaus and the\n(gate-controlled) Rashba interactions; these can be tuned to have equal strengths thus yielding kindependent eigenspinors even in two dimensions. We discuss implementations with two-dimensional\ndevices and quantum wires. In the latter, our setup presents strictly parabolic dispersions which\navoids complications arising from anticrossings of different bands.\n\nIn the recent years research in semiconductor physics\nhas been focused on the emerging field of spintronics.\nThis key word refers to the variety of efforts to use the\nelectron spin rather than, or in combination with, its\ncharge for information processing; or, even more ambitiously, quantum information processing [2]. Among the\nmost prominent device proposals is the spin field-effect\ntransistor (FET) due to Datta and Das [3]. This proposal\nuses the Rashba spin-orbit coupling to perform controlled\nrotations of spins of electrons passing through an FETtyped device. This particular spin-orbit interaction is\ndue to the inversion-asymmetry of the confining potential and is of the form [4]\n\u03b1\nHR = (px \u03c3 y \u2212 py \u03c3 x ) ,\n(1)\nh\u0304\nwhere p~ is the momentum of the electron confined in a\ntwo-dimensional geometry, and ~\u03c3 the vector of Pauli matrices. The coefficient \u03b1 is tunable in strength by the\nexternal gate of the FET. Due to the dependence on\nthe momentum, the Rashba spin-orbit coupling can be\nviewed as a wave vector-dependent Zeeman field which\ncan change drastically if the electron is scattered into\na different momentum state. Therefore, such scattering\nevents readily randomize the electron spin thus limiting\nthe range of operation of the Datta-Das spin-FET to the\nregime of ballistic transport where such processes do not\noccur.\nIn the present work we propose a modified version of\nthe spin-FET in which the electrons are not only subject\nto spin-orbit interaction of the Rashba but also of the\nDresselhaus type [5]. The latter is present in semiconductors lacking bulk inversion symmetry. When restricted to\na two-dimensional semiconductor nanostruture with appropriate growth geometry this coupling is of the form\n[6,7]\n\nspin-independent scattering and hence can also operate\nin a non-ballistic (or diffusive) regime. This unique feature follows from the possibility of tuning the Rashba\n(via proper gating) and the Dresselhaus terms so that\nthey have equal strengths \u03b1 = \u03b2. In this case, we\nshow quite generally below that the electron spinor is\nk-independent in two dimensions \u2013 even in the presence\nof (spin-independent) scatterers.\nTuned Rashba and Dresselhaus terms. Consider the\nHamiltonian H = p~2 /2m + V (~r) + HR + HD , where m\nis the effective mass of the semiconductor and V (~r) an\narbitrary scalar\npotential. For \u03b1 = \u00b1\u03b2 the operator \u03a3 =\n\u221a\n(\u03c3 x \u00b1 \u03c3 y )/ 2 provides an additional conserved quantity,\nand a general eigenstate of H and \u03a3 reads (for \u03b1 = +\u03b2)\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u221a\n2\n1\n1\n\u03c6(~r)e\u2213i 2\u03b1m(x\u2212y)/h\u0304 ,\n\u03c8\u00b1 (~r) = \u221a\n(3)\ni\u03c0/4\n\u00b1e\n2\nwhere the function \u03c6(~r) fulfills the usual spinindependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2\u03b12 m\nh\u03042 2\n\u2207 + V (~r) \u03c6(~r) = \u03b5 +\n\u2212\n\u03c6(~r),\n(4)\n2m\nh\u03042\nand \u03b5 is the energy eigenvalue of the wave function \u03c8\u00b1 (~r)\nwith \u03a3 = \u00b11. Since Eq. (4) is independent of the quantum number \u03a3 all eigenstates are generally twofold degenerate. Such two degenerate states differing in \u03a3 are\nrelated by time reversal. Note that the eigenvalue problem (4) is invariant under a formal time reversal, and the\nfunction \u03c6(~r) can be taken to be real. The potential V (~r)\ncan provide further confinement of the quantum well into\na quantum wire (see below) or a quantum dot; it can also\npossibly describe non-magnetic scatterers due to imperfections or impurities\nA robust two-dimensional spin-FET. We consider an\nFET setup given by a two-dimensional quantum well\nwhich is laterally contacted by two spin-polarized contacts. In the vertical direction across the well, an electric\nfield tuning the Rashba coefficient \u03b1 is provided by a\ngate. The spin-polarized leads can be realized by ferromagnetic metals, or by ferromagnetic semiconductors.\n\n\u03b2\n(px \u03c3 x \u2212 py \u03c3 y ) ,\n(2)\nh\u0304\nwhere the coefficient \u03b2 is determined by the semiconductor material and the geometry of the sample. Below we show that our proposed device is robust against\nHD =\n\n1\n\n\fThe latter version appears to be preferable with respect\nto the spin injection properties of the interfaces [2].\nWithin the two-dimensional channel the Hamiltonian\nis H = p~2 /2m + HR + HD whose eigenstates are\n\u0013 i~k~r\n\u0012\n1\ne\n1\n\u00b1\n,\n(5)\n\u03c8~ (~r) = \u221a\ni\u03c6(~\nk)\nk\n2\u03c0\n2 \u00b1e\n\nspin but a controlled rotation\n\u221a around the (1, 1, 0) axis\nby an angle \u03b7 given by \u03b7 = 2 2\u03b1m(ax \u2212 ay )/h\u03042 , where\n~a connects the locations where the particles are injected\nand detected, respectively. Therefore, if the locations of\ninjection and detection are defined with sufficient precision, an electron injected in a general spin state will not\nsuffer a randomization of it spin. However, uncertainties in those locations will translate to an uncertainty in\nthe rotation angle. A way to avoid this problem is to\ninject electrons in the eigenspinor states (1, \u00b1 exp(i\u03c0/4))\n(as discussed above) where the rotation has only a trivial\neffect, or to inject and detect electrons in a general spin\nstate through quantum point contacts leading to welldefined distance vector ~a. To enable a higher efficiency\nof the device, arrays of such quantum point contact pairs,\nseparated by barriers, can be used in parallel as shown\nschematically in figure 1.\nA similar finding was obtained numerically by Kiselev and Kim [11] who studied an effective spin model\nof the form H\u0303 = HR + HD , where the momentum\n~p(t) = m~r \u0307 is a classical variable (not an operator)\nwhose dependence on time t is generated by a Markovian process. TheR general time evolution operator reads\nt\np(t\u2032 )]/h\u0304), where T denotes the\nU(t) = T exp(\u2212i 0 dt\u2032 H\u0303[~\ntime-ordering symbol. For \u03b1 = \u03b2 the time ordering becomes trivial, and U(t) reads, up to a global phase,\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u03b7(~a)\n\u03c3x + \u03c3y\n\u03b7(~a)\nU(t) = 1 cos\nsin\n\u2212i \u221a\n,\n(7)\n2\n2\n2\n\u221a\nwith, as above, \u03b7(~a) = 2 2\u03b1m(ax \u2212 ay )/h\u03042 and ~a =\n~r(t) \u2212 ~r(0). Note that this finding is independent of\nwhether or not the energy H\u0303[~\np(t)] is conserved along the\npath ~p(t), as it was assumed in Ref. [11]. Thus, also\nthis simplified effective spin model (with the orbital degrees of freedom treated classically) leads to the same\ncontrolled spin rotation as the full quantum mechanical\nsolution (3). The above findings are in contrast with earlier assertions where a randomization of the spin was predicted to occur even for \u03b1 = \u03b2 [12], or at least for \u03b1 = \u03b2\nand a general spin state of the injected electron differing\nfrom (1, \u00b1 exp(i\u03c0/4)) [13]. These conclusions are due to\nthe weak-coupling treatment performed in [12,13] and become invalid in the presence of the additional conserved\nquantity \u03a3 arising at \u03b1 = \u03b2.\nA quantitative description of the transport in the\n\"on state\" of our device should include possible spinindependent scatterers in the potential V (~r) of Eq. (4).\nThis equation describes the orbital part of the singleparticle eigenstates whose spin part is independent of the\nmomentum for \u03b1 = \u03b2. Solutions to this equation can be\nmatched with wave functions in the leads according to\nthe appropriate boundary conditions in the presence of\nspin-orbit coupling [14,15]. Transmission coefficients can\nthen be determined from the stationary solutions.\nBallistic regime. In the strictly ballistic case (V (~r) =\n\nwith \u03c6(~k) = arg(\u2212\u03b1ky +\u03b2kx +i(\u03b1kx \u2212\u03b2ky )) and eigenenergies\nq\nh\u03042~k 2\n2\n2\n\u00b1 (\u03b1ky \u2212 \u03b2kx ) + (\u03b1kx \u2212 \u03b2ky ) . (6)\n\u03b5(~k) =\n2m\nFor general \u03b1 and \u03b2 the spinor in the eigenstates (5)\ndepends via \u03c6(~k) on the wave vector, and the dispersion\n(6) is non-parabolic. However, as described above, the\ncase \u03b1 = \u03b2 is particular. Here the spin state of the\nwave functions is independent of the wave vector, and the\ndispersion is perfectly parabolic. The first observation is\ncrucial for our device proposal.\nDevice operation. The \"off state\" of our transistor corresponds to a gate bias such that the Rashba and the\nDresselhaus coupling strengths are unequal, i.e., \u03b1 6= \u03b2.\nIn this case, the spinor of an injected electron is k dependent, Eq. (5), and hence becomes randomized due to momentum scattering. For strong enough spin relaxation,\nthe drain current is that of an unpolarized beam. The\npredominant spin-dephasing mechanism in spin transistors is that of the Dyakonov-Perel type [8,9], due to the\nlargest of the two s-o terms [10]. The \"on state\" of\nour device operates with a gate bias for which \u03b1 = \u03b2.\nHere an injected electron with arbitrary momentum and\nin one of the k-independent spin states (1, \u00b1 exp(i\u03c0/4))\ntraverses the transistor channel with its spin state unchanged. The current at the drain would be the same as\nthe injected one, assuming that the ferromagnetic source\nand drain have parallel polarizations. Note that spinindependent scattering events (provided by lattice imperfections, phonons, and non-magnetic impurities) cannot\nchange the spin state of the traversing electron. Moreover, as it will become clear from the discussion below,\nfurther device setups can be thought of as switching between the two points \u03b1 = \u00b1\u03b2 and/or using different combinations of magnetic polarizations in the contacts.\nAbsence of spin relaxation. The Elliot-Yafet spin-flip\nmechanism is completely suppressed for \u03b1 = \u03b2 (\"on\nstate\" of our device) since the spinor is k independent in\nthis case. In addition, the Rashba-Dresselhaus rotation\naxis is fixed for equal couplings and hence no DyakonovPerel spin relaxation is operative either. This can be\nseen from the general stationary solution (3): particles\ninjected into the device with spin components in one of\nthe eigenspinor states (1, \u00b1 exp(i\u03c0/4)) do not get altered\nat all (up to an unimportant global phase). Moreover, inspection of Eq.

In addition, as\nwe discuss below, there are no avoided crossings in the\nenergy dispersions. These results are significantly different from the usual case of a quantum wire with only the\nRashba s-o interaction [25\u201327]; there the bands are highly\nnon-parabolic and anti-cross for strong Rashba couplings.\nFigure 2 illustrates the wire dispersions for a two-band\nmodel. Note in Fig. 2(a) the features mentioned above\nfor the case with tuned couplings: parabolic dispersions\nwith no anticrossings. For differing coupling constants\n\u03b1 6= \u03b2, the bands are non-parabolic and display avoided\ncrossings. The contrasting features of the \u03b1 = \u03b2 and\n\u03b1 6= \u03b2 case are crucial for spin injection across a no-so/s-o active interface.\nSpin injection in quasi-1D channels. Strong Rashba\ns-o interaction can greatly affect the spin conductance of\nwires [26] and even suppress spin injection [27]. The wires\nwe consider here, with tuned s-o couplings \u03b1 = \u03b2, should\nnot present any obstacle to spin injection since the bands\nare parabolic with no avoided crossings. The problem\nwith tuned couplings is similar to that of a quantum wire\nwith uncoupled s-o bands, where spin injection is always\npossible in the ballistic regime [3].\nWe can also consider a spin-FET setup with a wire as\nthe connecting channel between the source and the drain.\nSince the spin part of the wire eigenstates are wave-vector\ndependent for \u03b1 6= \u03b2, this quasi-1D spin FET operates\nsimilarly to the non-ballistic two-dimensional one discussed earlier. That is, elastic and/or inelastic scattering\nprocesses changing the wave vector also randomize the\nspin state of transmitted electrons (\"off state\") for wires\nwith many bands. These effects are absent for \u03b1 = \u03b2 and\nthe spin state is preserved(\"on state\").\nInflences beyond the effective Hamiltonian. Our analysis assumes that the effects of spin-orbit interaction are\nentirely described by the contributions (1) and (2) to the\nHamiltonian. In a realistic semiconductor system there\nare additional corrections to these dominant terms. It\nis instructive to consider the influence of possible nonparabolicity in the band structure described by a contribution to the Hamiltonian of higher order in the momentum. For instance, as it was argued theoretically\n[22] and confirmed experimentally [19], particularly large\nvalues of \u03b1 are typically accompanied by a sizeable quartic nonparabolicity of the form (~\np2 )2 . This is due to\nthe similar dependence of both terms on the band gap.\nHowever, also in this case \u03a3 is still a conserved quantity at \u03b1 = \u03b2, and the Hamiltonian is invariant under\ntime reversal if only even powers of the momentum occur. In particular, if (1, exp(i\u03c0/4)\u03a6(~r) solves the station-\n\n0) and for source and drain with parallel polarizations chosen along either of the spinor directions\n(1, \u00b1 exp(i\u03c0/4)), we find the transmission amplitude\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u221a\n2\nm2\nk\ne\u2212ika\u00b1i 2\u03b1m2 a/h\u0304 4q m\n1\n,\n(8)\nT\u00b1 = \u0010\n\u00112\n\u00112\n\u0010\nm2\n\u2212iqa \u2212 m2 k \u2212 q\niqa\nk\n+\nq\ne\ne\nm1\nm1\nfor an electron injected at energy \u03b5 and wave vector ~k =\nk~ey . In (8) a is the length of s-o active region, m1 , m2 are\nthe band masses in the contacts\nqand the two-dimensional\nchannel, respectively, and q = 2m2 (\u03b5 \u2212 V0 )/h\u03042 with V0\nbeing a possible band offset between the contacts and\nthe FET channel (also including a contribution from so coupling). From the above expression one can find\nthe conductance using Landauer's fromula. Concerning\n+\n\u2212\nthe phase\n\u221a of transmitted electrons one finds T /T =\nexp(i2 2\u03b1m2 a/h\u03042 ). As discussed above, this phase factor is also obvious from the general form of eigenstates (3)\nand corresponds to a controlled rotation of the spin of the\ninjected particle around the (1,1,0)\ndirection. The rota\u221a\ntion angle is, up to a factor of 2, due to the presence of\nboth Rashba and Dresselhaus coupling, the same as the\none in the original proposal by Datta and Das [3]. Note,\nhowever, that here the spin part of the wave functions\nis independent of the wave vector. Moreover, according\nto the general form of eigenstates given by Eq. (3), the\nsame phase factor occurs if spin-independent scatterers\nencompassed in the potential V (~r) are included. Therefore, as discussed above, the range of operation of our\ndevice is not limited to the strictly ballistic regime.\nMagnitudes of \u03b1 and \u03b2. The largest values for \u03b1 observed in III-V semiconductors are of the order of a few\n0.1eV\u00c5 [16\u201321]. An estimate for the Dresselhaus coefficient in a confined geometry is obtained from \u03b2 = \u03b3hkz2 i,\nwhere hkz2 i is the expectation value of the square wave\nvector component in the growth direction. A typical\n3\nvalue for the coefficient \u03b3 is \u03b3 \u2248 25eV\u00c5 [22\u201324]. For an\ninfinite well with width w we find hkz2 i = (\u03c0/w)2 , which\nyields \u03b2 \u2248 0.09eV\u00c5 for w = 50\u00c5. Hence there should be\nno principle difficulty to achieve the situation \u03b1 = \u03b2 even\nin comparatively narrow wells. Note also that small deviations from the case \u03b1 = \u03b2, i.e. \u03b1 = \u03b2 + \u03b4 with |\u03b4/\u03b1| \u226a 1\nlead (using Fermi's golden rule) to spin scattering rates\nwhich are quadratic in \u03b4. Thus, spin dephasing due to\nspin-orbit coupling is completely suppressed in first order\nin \u03b4. This is in accordance with the results of Ref. [11]\nstudying an effective time-dependent Hamiltonian where\nthe inverse dephasing time has a minimum equal to zero\nat \u03b1 = \u03b2 and is differentiable around this point.\nQuantum wire with spin-orbit coupled bands. We now\nconsider a quantum wire formed by an additional confining potential V (x) along the x-direction. For \u03b1 = \u03b2\nsingle-particle wave functions\n\u221a are of the form (3) with\n\u03c6n (~r) = \u03c7n (x) exp(i(k \u2213 2\u03b1m/h\u03042 )y), where \u03c7n (x)\n3\n\n\fary Schr\u00f6dinger equation, so does the orthogonal state\n(1, \u2212 exp(i\u03c0/4)\u03a6\u2217 (~r) with the same energy, thus leading to the same general degeneracy pattern as in the\nparabolic case. Moreover, transmission amplitudes for\nsuch eigenspinor states are as before related by complex\nconjugation. Thus, for injection into eigenspinor states\n(1, \u00b1 exp(i\u03c0/4) the device operation is completely unaltered. For injection into linear combinations of them\nthe same controlled rotation around the (1, 1, 0) axis occurs. The rotation angle, however, is more difficult to determine since an elegant transformation as described in\nEqs. (3),(4) does not seem to exist. Note that the result\nfor the spin evolution operator (7) obtained within the\nclassical approximation remains the same if additional\nspin-independent terms are included, and the rotation\nangle is again given by the distance ~a. In summary, in\nsituations where a sizeable quartic term is present and\nthe classical approximation to the orbital motion appears\nproblematic, injection in directions close to the eigenspinor directions is favorable in order to ensure good device operation. Thus, even with such corrections like\nnonparabolicity being included, our spin-transistor proposal \u2013 which benefits from a unique \"cancellation\" of the\nRashba and the Dresselhaus terms for tuned couplings \u2013\nshould provide a substantial increase in performance and\nstability of a spin-FET device as compared with the original proposal [3]. We stress that this cancellation occurs\nfor both signs in the relation \u03b1 = \u00b1\u03b2. Therefore further\ndevices can be envisioned switching between these two\npoints and/or using different combinations of magnetic\npolarizations in the contacts.\nThis work was supported by NCCR Nanoscience, the\nSwiss NSF, DARPA, and ARO.\n\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n[22]\n[23]\n[24]\n[25]\n\n[26]\n[27]\n\ntation, F.
