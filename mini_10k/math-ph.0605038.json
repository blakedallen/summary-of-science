Introduction\nThe paper is devoted to the study of the spectrum of the Schr\u00f6dinger\nand Pauli operators in the plane, with nonzero constant magnetic field\nperturbed by smooth compactly supported magnetic and electric fields.\nThe Landau Hamiltonian describing the motion of the quantum particle in two dimensions under the influence of the constant magnetic\nfield is one of the classical models in quantum physics. It was introduced and studied in late 1920-s, see [10]. It turned out that the system\npossesses rather unusual spectral properties: the spectrum consists of\ndiscrete eigenvalues lying at the points of an arithmetic progression and\nall these eigenvalues have infinite multiplicity. These eigenvalues are\ntraditionally called Landau levels (LL) and the corresponding spectral\nsubspaces are called Landau subspaces.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nROZENBLUM AND TASHCHIYAN\n\nA natural question arises, what happens with the spectrum of the\nLandau Hamiltonian under perturbations. If the perturbation is strong,\nsay, it is a Coulomb electric field, it turns out more reasonable to consider the constant magnetic field as a perturbation, and it leads to\nZeeman effect. On the other hand, one can consider weak perturbations of the Landau Hamiltonian by a fast decaying or even compactly\nsupported electric or/and magnetic field. In this case it is natural to\nexpect that the Landau levels will split, and the question consists in describing this splitting as well as the behavior of the spectral subspaces\nunder the perturbation.\nThe case of the perturbation by an electric potential, moderately,\npower-like decaying at infinity, was first studied by Raikov in [12]. It\nwas shown that each LL splits into an infinite sequence of eigenvalues,\nconverging to the originating LL. The rate of convergence of these\neigenvalues is also power-like and it is determined by the rate of decay\nof the perturbation at infinity, the asymptotics being described by a\nsemi-classical formula. Advanced methods of micro-local analysis were\nused in [12].\nThe case of a fast decaying (or compactly supported) electric potential was dealt with much later, in [13], see also [11]. It turned\nout that the Landau levels still split, however in an unusual, not a\nsemi-classical way. Most profoundly this can be seen for a compactly\nsupported perturbation. The semi-classical considerations, formally\napplied, would lead to a finite number of eigenvalues splitting away\nfrom the LL. However, in fact, not a finite but an infinite number of\neigenvalues split away, but they converge to the LL extraordinarily\nfast, super-exponentially. Moreover, the leading term in the asymptotics does not depend on the perturbation at all, and the next term\n(as it was found recently in [5]) is determined by the geometry of the\nsupport of the perturbation. This result can be also understood as\njustifying the first order Raleigh-Schr\u00f6dinger perturbative correction,\nwith properly chosen initial basis in the Landau subspace. Methods of\nmicro-local analysis do not work here, and the results are obtained by\na combinations of methods of complex analysis and variational considerations.\nConsiderably less is known about the perturbations of the Landau\nHamiltonian by a weak magnetic field. The complication here has\nits roots in the fact that it is not the magnetic field itself but its\npotential that enters in the quantum Hamiltonian. Unless the total\nflux of the perturbing magnetic field vanishes, the perturbation of the\n(Schr\u00f6dinger or Pauli) operator contains rather slowly decaying coefficients, so it is fairly strong even for a compactly supported perturbation\nof the field and it even may be not relatively compact if the perturbation goes to zero at infinity not sufficiently fast. Iwatsuka [9] proved\nthat invariance of the essential spectrum still takes place, so Landau\n\n\fPERTURBED LANDAU HAMILTONIAN\n\n3\n\nlevels are the only possible limit points of eigenvalues in the gaps between them. After that, there were very few results in the spectral\nanalysis of this problem (apart from the rather specific situation with\nthe lowest LL). In the paper [4] the perturbation by a single AharonovBohm solenoid was considered. For the standard self-adjoint extension,\nby means of explicitly solving the eigenvalue problem, it was established\nthat the Landau levels are still intact, the eigenspaces change in a controlled way, and a finite number of eigenvalues split away from each\nLL. Hempel and Levendorski in [8] and Besch in [3] investigated the\nbehavior of the eigenvalues in the gaps when a large parameter tending\nto infinity stands in front of the perturbation. The number of eigenvalues between the Landau levels grows quasi-classically, as a power\nof the parameter, but nothing was found out about the distribution\nof the eigenvalues for a fixed value of the parameter. However it was\nshown that one should not expect monotonicity of the eigenvalues in\nthis parameter, even if the perturbing field has constant sign.\nThe aim of the present paper is to find out what happens with the\nspectrum and spectral subspaces of the Landau Hamiltonian under\nsmooth compactly supported perturbations of the magnetic field, with\nadditional perturbation by a compactly supported electric field (thus\nboth the case of the magnetic Schr\u00f6dinger and of the Pauli operators\nare taken care of). We show that the Landau levels split superexponentially, and under certain positivity conditions find the asymptotics\nof eigenvalues as they approach the LL. We find also a rather exact\napproximation to the spectral subspaces of the perturbed operator.\nIt turns out that the spectral subspaces are perturbed fairly strongly.\nThis effect is absent for the perturbation by the electric field only: we\nshow that in the latter case the spectral subspaces change very weakly,\nin proper terms (the behavior of spectral subspaces was not investigated in [13], [11]).\nOur approach is based upon the study of approximate creation and\nannihilation operators. The commutation relations for these operators\n(the deformed Heisenberg relations) enable us to construct approximate\nspectral subspaces. It is known that for the unperturbed operator the\nLandau subspaces are obtained by repeatedly applying the creation\noperator to the explicitly described infinite-dimensional space of zero\nmodes of the Pauli operator. The Pauli operator with the perturbed\nmagnetic field possesses an infinite-dimensional space of zero modes as\nwell, moreover, this subspace can also be explicitly described. It turns\nout that the application of the same procedure for the perturbed operator, but using the approximate creation operator instead, produces a\nvery good approximation for the spectral subspaces for the perturbed\noperator.\nIn the papers [13], [11], [5], the splitting of Landau levels under\nthe electric perturbation was associated with the spectrum of certain\n\n\f4\n\nROZENBLUM AND TASHCHIYAN\n\nToeplitz-type operators acting in the spectral subspaces. In our case,\nthe study of the spectrum of the perturbed operator is based upon the\nanalysis of Toeplitz-type operators in the space of zero modes, generalized in the sense that a differential operator replaces the multiplication\nby a function in the Toeplitz expression.\nWe prove the asymptotics of the eigenvalues split from the Landau\nlevel under a certain positivity condition imposed on the effective potential reflecting the combined influence of the electric and magnetic\nperturbations upon the spectrum. If this condition is not fulfilled, we\ncan only prove the superexponential estimate from above. The obstacle\nhere is the lack of knowledge of the spectrum of the Toeplitz-like operators with indefinite weight in the space of zero modes, which turns\nout to be a separate hard problem in complex analysis.\nIn Section 2 we define our main operators and establish a series\nof relations between them. Further, in Section 3, we construct the\napproximate spectral subspaces. In Section 4 we prove that they form\na very good approximation for the actual spectral subspaces. As a byproduct, we show that the spectral subspaces 'almost' do not change\nif just an electric perturbation is present. Section 5 is devoted to the\nanalysis of the Toeplitz-like operators. In Sect. 6 we establish the\nestimates, and when possible, the asymptotics in the Landau levels\nsplitting. The last section contains the proofs of several rather technical\nformulas and estimates.\nDifferent results involve different smoothness conditions imposed on\nthe perturbations. The upper estimate for the eigenvalue splitting is\nproved for C 2 compactly supported perturbations. On the other hand,\nthe lower estimates granting the eigenvalue asymptotics, as well as the\nresult on the approximate spectral subspaces are proved for infinitely\ndifferentiable perturbations. These latter smoothness conditions can\nbe replaced by some finite smoothness, depending on the Landau level\nunder consideration, but we do not go into these details.\nThe conditions of the perturbations to have compact support can\nbe replaced by the requirements of controlled decay at infinity. In\nthat case the results on the eigenvalue splitting and on the spectral\nsubspaces approximation can also be obtained, with the eigenvalue\nestimates and asymptotics as well as the quality of spectral subspaces\napproximation depending on the rate of decay. These resulst will be\npublished elsewhere.\nThe second author was partly supported by a grant from the Royal\nSwedish Academy of Sciences, he also thanks Chalmers University of\nTechnology in Gothenburg for hospitality.\n2. Magnetic Schr\u00f6dinger and Pauli operators\nWe will denote the points in the plane R2 by x = (x1 , x2 ); it is\nconvenient to identify R2 with C by setting z = x1 + ix2 . The Lebesgue\n\n\fPERTURBED LANDAU HAMILTONIAN\n\n5\n\nmeasure will be denoted by dx and the derivatives by \u2202k = \u2202xk ; we set,\nas usual, \u2202 \u0304 = (\u22021 + i\u22022 )/2, \u2202 = (\u22021 \u2212 i\u22022 )/2.\nThe constant magnetic field will be denoted by B\u25e6 ; we fix the sign,\nB\u25e6 > 0. With this magnetic field we associate the magnetic potential\n\u25e6\nA\u25e6 (x) = (A\u25e61 , A\u25e62 ) = B2 (\u2212x2 , x1 ). Then the (unperturbed) magnetic\nSchr\u00f6dinger operator in L2 (R2 ) is defined as\nH\u25e6 = \u2212(\u2207 \u2212 iA\u25e6 )2 .\n\n(2.1)\nspin- 21\n\nThe Pauli operator describing the motion of a\nparticle acts in the\n2 2\nspace L2 (R ) of two-component vector functions, it has the diagonal\nform, P\u25e6 = diag (P\u25e6+ , P\u25e6\u2212 ), where P\u25e6\u00b1 = H\u25e6 \u00b1 B\u25e6 .\nThe spectrum of the Schr\u00f6dinger operator was found by Landau in\n1928 (see [10]) by separation of variables. However more conveniently\nthe spectral structure of these operators is described by means of creation and annihilation operators introduced by Fock [6] and reflecting\nthe algebraical structure of the problem (see, for example the detailed\nexposition in [7] or [2]). Let us introduce the complex magnetic potential A\u25e6 = A\u25e61 + iA\u25e62 and set\nQ\u25e6 = \u22122i\u2202 \u0304 \u2212 A\u25e6 , Q\u25e6 = \u22122i\u2202 \u2212 A\u25e6 .\n(2.2)\nThese operators can be also expressed by means of the scalar potential\nof the magnetic field, the function\nB\u25e6 2\n\u03a8\u25e6 (z) =\n|z|\n(2.3)\n4\nsolving the equation \u2206\u03a8\u25e6 = B\u25e6 :\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\n \u0304 \u03a8\u25e6 .\nQ\u25e6 = \u22122ie\u03a8 \u2202e\u2212\u03a8 , Q\u25e6 = \u22122ie\u2212\u03a8 \u2202e\nThe creation and annihilation operators Q\u25e6 , Q\u25e6 satisfy the following\nbasic relation\n[Q\u25e6 , Q\u25e6 ] = 2B\u25e6 .\n(2.4)\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\nThis relation, meaning that the operators Q , Q , 2B generate a representation of the Heisenberg algebra, together with the formulas\nP\u25e6+ = Q\u25e6 Q\u25e6 , P\u25e6\u2212 = Q\u25e6 Q\u25e6 , H\u25e6 = Q\u25e6 Q\u25e6 \u2212 B\u25e6 = Q\u25e6 Q\u25e6 + B\u25e6 ,\n\n(2.5)\n\nenable one to describe the spectrum completely, and the construction\nis presented in numerous physical and mathematical sources. Since\nQ\u25e6 = Q\u25e6 \u2217 , the equation P\u25e6\u2212 u = 0 is equivalent to\n\u25e6\n \u0304 \u03a8\u25e6 u) = 0.\nQ\u25e6 u = e\u2212\u03a8 \u2202(e\n\u25e6\n\nThis means that f = e\u03a8 u is an entire analytical function in C, such\n\u25e6\nthat after multiplication by e\u2212\u03a8 it belongs to L2 . The space of such\nfunctions f is called Fock or Segal-Bargmann space F (see [1], [2],\n[7] for extensive discussion); when we need to specify the particular\nweight involved in the definition of F we will use the notation FB\u25e6 .\nSo, the null subspace of the operator P\u25e6\u2212 , i.e., its spectral subspace\n\u25e6\ncorresponding to the eigenvalue \u039b0 = 0, is L0 = e\u2212\u03a8 F . After this,\n\n\f6\n\nROZENBLUM AND TASHCHIYAN\n\nthe commutation relations (2.4), (2.5) imply that \u039b1 = 2B\u25e6 is the\nlowest eigenvalue of the operator P\u25e6+ = P\u25e6\u2212 + 2B\u25e6 , with the same\nspectral subspace, and thus L1 = Q\u25e6 L0 is the spectral subspace of\nP\u25e6\u2212 with eigenvalue \u039b1 and so on. So, the spectrum of P\u25e6\u2212 consists of\neigenvalues, Landau levels \u039bq = 2qB\u25e6, q = 0, 1, . . . , and the spectra of\nH\u25e6 , P\u25e6+ consist, respectively, of \u039bq + B\u25e6 and \u039bq + 2B\u25e6 . The operators\nQ\u25e6 , Q\u25e6 act between Landau subspaces Lq = Q\u25e6 q L0 , q = 0, 1, . . . ,\nQ\u25e6 : Lq 7\u2192 Lq+1 , Q\u25e6 : Lq 7\u2192 Lq\u22121 , Q\u25e6 : L0 7\u2192 0,\n\n(2.6)\n\nand are, up to constant factors, isometries of Landau subspaces.\nIt is also convenient to introduce the spectral projection Pq\u25e6 of P\u25e6\u2212\ncorresponding to the eigenvalue \u039bq = 2qB\u25e6 . The above reasoning can\nbe expressed as\nPq\u25e6 = Cq\u22121 Q\u25e6 q P0\u25e6 Q\u25e6q , Cq = q!(2B\u25e6 )q .\n\n(2.7)\n\nNow we introduce the perturbation b \u2208 C0\u221e (R2 ) of the magnetic\nfield, and we set B = B\u25e6 + b. Let \u03c8 be a scalar potential for the\nfield b, a solution of the equation \u2206\u03c8 = b. Of course, \u03c8 is defined up\nto a harmonic summand, the choice of \u03c8 corresponds to the choice of\ngauge. The magnetic potential a = (a1 , a2 ) = (\u2212\u22022 \u03c8, \u22021 \u03c8), curl a = b,\nis thus determined up to a gradient, and the complete scalar and vector\nmagnetic potentials are\n\u03a8 = \u03a8\u25e6 + \u03c8, A = A\u25e6 + a.\n\n(2.8)\n\nThe crucial observation here is that although b has compact support,\nwe should not expect the same, or even a rapid\ndecay, from the magR\nnetic potential a, unless the total flux of b, b(x)dx is zero. This can\nbe seen in the easiest way by applying Green's formula, saying that the\ncirculation of the vector field a along the circle with radius R equals\nthe flux of b = curl a through the disk |x| < R. Thus, if the total flux\nof b is nonzero and R is taken large enough, so that the support of b\nlies in the disk, the circulation of a is bounded away from zero, and\nthus a may not decay faster than CR\u22121 , at least in some directions.\nThis corresponds to a logarithmical growth rate of \u03c8.\nWe define the perturbed magnetic Schr\u00f6dinger operator as in (2.1),\nwith A\u25e6 replaced by A:\nH = \u2212(\u2207 \u2212 iA)2 ,\nand the components of Pauli operator as\nP\u00b1 = H \u00b1 B.\nIt is easy to observe that the difference between H and H\u25e6 contains an\noperator of multiplication by A\u25e6 * a, the latter function does not decay\nat infinity (again unless the total flux of b vanishes), and thus looks like\nbeing not a relatively compact perturbation of H\u25e6 . However, thanks to\n\n\fPERTURBED LANDAU HAMILTONIAN\n\n7\n\nthe special form of this term, the perturbation is still relatively compact\nif a \u2192 0 at infinity, as was noticed by Besch [3].\nNow let us look at the algebraic structure related with the perturbed\noperators. The perturbed creation and annihilation operators are defined similarly to (2.2):\nQ = \u22122i\u2202 \u2212 A, Q = \u22122i\u2202 \u0304 \u2212 A,\nwhere A is the complex magnetic potential, A = A\u25e6 + (a1 + ia2 ). The\nrepresentation via the scalar potential takes the form\n \u0304 \u03a8.\nQ = \u22122ie\u03a8 \u2202e\u2212\u03a8 , Q = \u22122ie\u2212\u03a8 \u2202e\nMost important for us are the commutation relations for Q, Q:\n[Q, Q] = 2B = 2B\u25e6 + 2b,\n\n(2.9)\n\ntogether with\nP+ = QQ, P\u2212 = QQ, P+ \u2212 P\u2212 = 2B = 2B\u25e6 + 2b,\nH = QQ \u2212 B = QQ + B.\n\n(2.10)\n(2.11)\n\nThe relations (2.9)-(2.11) look similar to (2.4), (2.5), however the\ncrucial difference is that the new ones contain variable functions on\nthe right-hand side, do not represent the Heisenberg algebra any more\nand thus cannot be used for the exact spectral analysis. The spectra of\nSchr\u00f6dinger and Pauli operators do not determine each other any more.\nThe only information that one can obtain immediately, is the description of the lowest point of the spectrum of P\u2212 . Since, again, Q = Q\u2217 ,\n \u0304\nthe equation P\u2212 u = 0 is equivalent to Qu = 0, or \u2202(exp(\u03a8)u)\n= 0.\nSo the function f = u exp \u03a8 is an entire analytical function such that\nu = exp(\u2212\u03a8)f \u2208 L2 . The space of entire functions with this property\nis, obviously, infinite-dimensional, it contains at least all polynomials\nof z, although it does not necessarily coincide with Fock space, since\nexp(\u2212\u03c8) may have power growth (or decay). We denote this space by\nF b.\nThe same reasoning, applied to P+ , shows that the null subspace\nof Q, as well as the one of P+ is zero: it consists of anti-analytical\nfunctions which belong to L2 after the multiplication by the growing\nexponent exp(\u03a8), and there are no such functions, except zero.\nWe denote the null-space of P\u2212 , the space of zero modes, by H0 . In\n[14] rather general sufficient conditions were found for infiniteness of\ndimension of H0 ; in particular they even do not require the magnetic\nfield to be a weak perturbation of the constant one.\nAs it follows from the relative compactness of the perturbation, by\nWeyl's theorem, the essential spectrum of the perturbed operator P\u2212\nconsists of the same Landau levels \u039bq , and the eigenvalues in the gaps\nand below \u039b0 may only have \u039bq as their limit points. This latter fact\nwas established much earlier by Iwatsuka [9], and the reasoning based\nupon the commutation relations remains valid even in the case of a\n\n\f8\n\nROZENBLUM AND TASHCHIYAN\n\nslowly decaying magnetic perturbation, when the perturbation of the\noperator is not relatively compact any more. Since our considerations\nin the paper can be considered as an extension of the ones of Iwatsuka,\nwe reproduce the reasoning from [9].\nTheorem 2.1. ([9]) The essential spectrum of the operator P\u2212 consists\nof the points \u039bq , q = 0, 1, . . . . The essential spectra of H and P+\nconsist, respectively, of the points \u039bq + B\u25e6 and \u039bq + 2B\u25e6 .\nProof. Note first that the operator of multiplication by b is relatively\ncompact with respect to H and P\u00b1 . Thus, by Weyl theorem, the operators P+ and P\u2212 + 2B\u25e6 = P+ \u2212 2b have the same essential spectrum,\ni.e. the essential spectrum of P+ is just the one of P\u2212 , shifted by 2B\u25e6 .\nSo, P+ has no essential spectrum in [0, 2B\u25e6). On the other hand, the\nnonzero spectra of P+ and P\u2212 coincide, since these operators are just\nproducts of Q and Q in the opposite order. Therefore P\u2212 has no essential spectrum in (0, 2B\u25e6), and 2B\u25e6 belongs to the essential spectrum.\nAgain, this means that the interval (2B\u25e6 , 4B\u25e6) is free from the essential\nspectrum of P+ and 4B\u25e6 belongs to it. By repeating this reasoning,\nthe complete description of the essential spectrum is obtained.\n\u0003\nNow we add a perturbation by the electric potential. Let V (x) be a\nreal valued function in C0\u221e (R2 ). We introduce the operators\nH(V ) = H + V, P\u00b1 (V ) = P\u00b1 + V.\n\n(2.12)\n\nSince the operator of multiplication by V is relatively compact with\nrespect to H, P\u00b1 , the operators (2.12) have the same essential spectra\nas the respective unperturbed ones. In this paper we are going to study\nthe behavior of the eigenvalues of H(V ), P\u00b1 (V ) near these Landau\nlevels.\n3. Approximate spectral subspaces\nIn this section we construct the approximate spectral subspaces of\nthe operators (2.12) under the condition b \u2208 C0\u221e . To do this, we need\nsome more properties of the space H0 of zero modes of P\u2212 . We must\nkeep in mind that the ambiguity in associating the vector potential\nwith the magnetic field leads to the ambiguity in defining the magnetic\noperators themselves. The gauge transformations of the form u 7\u2192 ei\u0398 u\nwith real functions \u0398(z) such that ei\u0398 is smooth, realize the unitary\nequivalence of magnetic operators constructed by different choice of the\npotential.\nAs it was explained in Section 2, the space H0 consists of functions\nu(z) having the form u(z) = e\u2212\u03a8(z) f (z) where f (z) is an analytical\nentire function such that e\u2212\u03a8 f \u2208 L2 , and \u03a8(z) is the potential in\n(2.8). Note first that the choice of \u03a8 does not affect H0 , up to a gauge\ntransformation. In fact, let \u03a6 be a harmonic function in R2 , so that\n\u03a8\u2032 = \u03a8 + \u03a6 is also a potential for the magnetic field B = B\u25e6 + b,\n\n\fPERTURBED LANDAU HAMILTONIAN\n\n9\n\n\u2206\u03a8\u2032 = B. Denote by \u0398 the function harmonic conjugate to \u03a6, so\nthat F = \u03a6 + i\u0398 is an entire analytical function. This gives us the\nrepresentation\n\u2032\nu(z) = e\u2212i\u0398(z) e\u2212\u03a8 (z) (eF (z) f (z)),\nso the multiplication by ei\u0398(z) is the gauge transformation in question.\nHowever the perturbation of the magnetic field leads to the perturbation of the space of zero modes that cannot be reduced to a gauge\ntransformation. In fact, if there were a real function \u0398(z) such that\nei\u0398 H0 = L0 , this would mean that the function e\u2212\u03c8+i\u0398 is analytical.\nHowever in this case the function \u2212\u03c8, as the logarithm of the absolute\nvalue of an analytical function, must be harmonic, which it is not.\nNevertheless there is a close relation between H0 and L0 , not reduced to a gauge transform. We fix the potential \u03c8, defining it as the\nlogarithmic potential of the field b,\nZ\n\u22121\nb(y) log |x \u2212 y|dy.\n(3.1)\n\u03c8(x) = (2\u03c0)\nThe behavior of the potential \u03c8 at infinity is determined by \u03c3, the\ntotal flux of the perturbing field divided by 2\u03c0,\nZ\n\u22121\nb(x)dx.\n\u03c3 = (2\u03c0)\nIf \u03c3 = 0, \u03c8 is a bounded function, as well as e\u00b1\u03c8 . So, the multiplication by the bounded function m = e\u2212\u03c8 maps L0 to H0 . This mapping\nis, obviously, invertible.\nNow suppose that \u03c3 > 0. Then the function \u03c8(x) grows at infinity\nas \u03c3 log |x|, m(x) = e\u03c8(x) grows as |x|\u03c3 and it is not bounded any\nmore. The function e\u2212\u03c8(x) is bounded. Thus the multiplication by\nm\u22121 is a bounded operator from H0 to L0 . The inverse mapping is\nnot bounded, but we show that, nevertheless, it is well defined on a\ncertain subspace in L0 . Denote by \u03bd the smallest integer larger than\n\u03c3. Fix \u03bd arbitrary different points z1 , . . . , z\u03bd in C. Denote by p(z) the\nmonic polynomial with simple zeros at the points z1 , . . . , z\u03bd and by L\u03030\nthe space of functions in L0 having zeros at these points. Since the\nevaluation at a point is a bounded functional in the Fock space, L\u03030 is\na closed subspace in L0 , with codimension \u03bd. Now consider the space\nL\u03bd0 = p(z)\u22121 L\u03030 . By our construction, this space is still a part of L0\n(however is not a closed subspace any more). Since at infinity we have\ne\u03c8(z) = O(p(z)\u22121 ), the operator of multiplication by e\u03c8(z) maps L\u03bd0 to\nH0 . In the case of a negative \u03c3, the spaces H0 and L0 change places in\nthe above reasoning.\nThe space H0 is closely related to the spaces F\u03c1 introduced in [1],\nSection 3, consisting of entire analytical functions f (z) that belong to\nL2 after being multiplied by \u03b8\u03c1 (z) = (1 + |z|2 )\u2212\u03c1/2 exp(\u2212(B\u25e6 /4)|z|2 ).\nDue to (3.1), the function \u03be(z) = \u03c8(z) \u2212 \u03c32 log(1 + |z|2 ) is bounded, so\n\n\f10\n\nROZENBLUM AND TASHCHIYAN\n\nwe can write\ne\u2212\u03a8(z) = \u03b8\u2212\u03c3 (z)e\u2212\u03be(z) .\nTherefore our space H0 can be obtained from Bargmann's space \u03b8\u2212\u03c3 (z)F\u03c3\nby multiplication by the bounded and boundedly invertible function\ne\u2212\u03be(z) . This means that many properties of this Bargmann space are\ninherited by our space H0 . What is important for us at the moment\nis the fact established in [1], Section 3.6, that the functions of the\nform \u03b8\u03c3 (z)z n form a basis in \u03b8\u03c3 (z)F\u03c3 . Therefore this space possesses\na dense set consisting of rapidly decaying functions (having the form\n\u03b8\u2212\u03c3 (z)p(z), with polynomial p), and thus our null subspace H0 possesses a dense subspace of rapidly decaying functions as well.\nLet \u03b4q = (\u039bq \u2212 \u03b3, \u039bq + \u03b3), q = 0, 1, 2, . . . , be intervals of the same\nsize on the real axis, centered at the Landau levels \u039bq = 2qB\u25e6 , and not\ncontaining the neighboring Landau levels \u039bq\u00b11 . We choose the size of\n\u03b4q in such way that neither of these intervals has the eigenvalues of P\u2212\nat its endpoints. Moreover, since the lowest LL \u039b0 = 0 is an isolated\npoint of the spectrum of P\u2212 , we can choose the size of the intervals in\nsuch way that \u03b40 contains only this point of spectrum. We denote by\nHq the spectral subspace of P\u2212 corresponding to the interval \u03b4q and\nby Pq the corresponding spectral projection. Since, by Theorem 2.1,\nthe spectrum of P\u2212 is discrete between Landau levels, the change of \u03b4q\nleads only to a finite-rank perturbation of Pq . As usual, the spectral\nprojection Pq can be be expressed by means of the integration of the\nresolvent of P\u2212 along a closed contour \u0393q in the complex plane, not\npassing through the eigenvalues of P\u2212 and containing inside only those\neigenvalues that lie in \u03b4q . Again, using the discreteness of the spectrum\nof P\u2212 between the Landau levels, we can choose these contours in such\nway that all they are obtained from \u03930 by the shift along the real axis\nin the complex spectral plane, \u0393q = \u03930 + 2qB\u25e6 .\nNow we are going to establish several properties of the subspaces Lq ,\nprojections Pq and some related operators.\nFirst, note the simple fact following directly from the spectral theorem.\nProposition 3.1. For any q = 0, 1, . . . , and any polynomial p(\u03bb) the\noperator p(P\u2212 )Pq is bounded, moreover the operator (p(P\u2212 )\u2212p(\u039bq ))Pq\nis compact.\nIn fact, by the spectral theorem the nonzero spectrum of the operator\np(P\u2212 )Pq consists of the points p(\u03bbj ) where \u03bbj are all points of spectrum\nof P\u2212 in \u03b4q and thus all p(\u03bbj ) live in a bounded interval. Moreover,\np(\u03bbj ) may only have p(\u039bq ) as their limit point, by Theorem 2.1.\nThe following lemma will enable us later to establish a much stronger\ncompactness property.\nLemma 3.2. Let each of Tj , j = 1, . . . , N be one of operators Q or Q.\nThen for some constants C, C \u2032 , for any u in the domain of the operator\n\n\fPERTURBED LANDAU HAMILTONIAN\n\nPN\n\u2212,\n\n\u2032\n2\nkT1 T2 . . . TN uk2 \u2264 C(PN\n\u2212 u, u) + C kuk .\n\n11\n\n(3.2)\n\nThe proof of Lemma 3.2 can be found in Section 7.\nNow we can establish the compactness property.\nProposition 3.3. Let T1 , . . . , TN be a collection of operators, each being Q or Q, and let hj , j = 0, . . . N be functions with all derivatives\nbounded, T = h0 T1 h1 . . . TN hN . Then for any q and for any polynomial\np(\u03bb) the operators T (p(P\u2212 ) \u2212 p(\u039bq ))Pq T are compact.\nProof. By commuting functions hj and operators Tj (moving all functions to the left), we can transform the left operator T to the sum of\nterms having the form h\u0303\u03ba T\u03ba where h\u0303\u03ba are bounded functions and T\u03ba is\na product of no more than N operators Q, Q. Similarly, in the copy of\nT that stands to the right from Pq , we move all functions to the utmost\nright positions, to get the representation of T as a sum of terms T\u03bah\u0303\u03ba ,\nbeing the product of a bounded smooth function h\u0303\u03ba and no more than\nN operators Q, Q.\nFor each of the terms arising in this way in the decomposition of\nT (p(P\u2212 ) \u2212 p(\u039bq ))Pq T , we can write\n\u22121\nh\u0303\u03ba T\u03ba (p(P\u2212 ) \u2212 p(\u039bq ))Pq T\u03bah\u0303\u03ba = [h\u0303\u03ba T\u03ba (PN\n\u2212 + 1) ]\u00d7\n\n(3.3)\n\nN\nN\n\u22121\n[(PN\n\u2212 + 1)(p(P\u2212 ) \u2212 p(\u039bq ))Pq (P\u2212 + 1)][(P\u2212 + 1) T\u03ba h\u0303\u03ba ].\n\nIn (3.3), the first factor in brackets is bounded by Lemma 3.2, and the\nmiddle factor is compact by Proposition 3.1. The last factor in brackets\nis also bounded, by Lemma 3.2 applied to the adjoint operator.\n\u0003\nThe result we have just proved indicates that, probably, the eigenvalues of the operator P\u2212 , lying near \u039bq , must converge to \u039bq rather\nrapidly. This will be, in fact, established later on.\nNow we are going to describe the main construction of the paper,\nthe approximate spectral subspaces of the perturbed operator. Note,\nfirst of all, that it is sufficient to consider the operator P\u2212 (V ). In fact,\ndue to the commutation relations, we have\nH(V ) = P\u2212 (V + b) + B\u25e6 , P+ (V ) = P\u2212 (V + 2b) + 2B\u25e6 ,\nand thus the operators differ from P\u2212 by a shift and by the electric\ntype perturbations V + b, V + 2b. We start by finding approximate\nspectral subspaces of P\u2212 . Adding V will be an easier task after this.\nThe subspaces approximating Hq will be defined in the following\nway:\nG0 = H0 , Gq = Qq G0 , q = 1, 2, . . . .\n(3.4)\nSo we mimic the construction of the eigenspaces of the unperturbed\nLandau Hamiltonian, see (2.6). Our approximate spectral subspaces\nare obtained by applying the creation operators to the space of zero\nmodes.\n\n\f12\n\nROZENBLUM AND TASHCHIYAN\n\nOf course, since we apply the unbounded operator Q, we must show\nthat all the time we do not leave the space L2 , and moreover, we have to\nprove that the subspaces Gq are closed. Both these properties, as well\nas some other results of the paper will be based upon the important\nProposition 3.4 to follow. But first we need a definition.\nMany times in the paper we will encounter operators that are products of several copies of Q, Q, functions B, b, U (for some smooth function U) and their derivatives. Let us assign the weight 2 to B\u25e6 , B, b, U,\nthe weight l + 2 to the order l derivatives of b, U and the weight 1 to\nQ and to Q. For a product of operators and functions the weights of\nfactors are added.\nProposition 3.4. Let q > 0.\n(1) There exists a function Zq [b] \u2208 C0\u221e depending only on q, B\u25e6 ,\nand b such that for any u \u2208 H0 ,\nkQq uk2 = Cq kuk2 + (Zq [b]u, u), Cq = q!(2B\u25e6 )q .\n\n(3.5)\n\nThe function Zq [b] is a polynomial of b and its derivatives up\nto the order 2q \u2212 2 with coefficients depending on B\u25e6 . All summands in Zq [b] have weight 2q. The term with the highest derivative equals 2\u2206q b; the term linear in b and not containing\nderivatives equals Cq\u2032 B\u25e6 q\u22121 b, Cq\u2032 = 2q q!q.\n(2) There exists a function Xq [b, U] \u2208 C0\u221e depending only on q, B\u25e6 ,\nb, and U such that for any u \u2208 H0 .\n(UQq u, Qq u) = (Xq [b, U]u, u).\n\n(3.6)\n\nThe function Xq [b, U] is expressible as an order 2q linear differential operator acting on U, with coefficients depending polynomially on b, its derivatives, and B\u25e6 . All the terms in Xq [b, U]\nhave weight 2q + 2. The term with the highest derivative of U is\n\u2206q U. The term with zero order derivative of U is Cq U +Zq [b]U.\n(3) There exists a function Yq [b, U] \u2208 C0\u221e depending only on q, B\u25e6 ,\nb, and U such that for any u \u2208 H0 .\n(UQq u, Qq+1 u) = (Yq [b, U]u, u).\n\n(3.7)\n\nThe function Yq [b, U] is expressible as an order 2q + 1 linear\ndifferential operator acting on U, with coefficients depending\npolynomially on b, its derivatives, and B\u25e6 . All the terms in\nYq [b, U] have weight 2q+3. The term with the highest derivative\n \u0304\nof U is (\u22122i)\u2206q \u2202U.\nThe term with zero order derivative of U\nis Cq U + Zq [b]U.\nProof. First, in order to make the main mechanism of the proof more\nclear, we derive the relation (3.5) for q = 1 and q = 2. It is sufficient\nto prove (3.5) for u = exp(\u2212\u03a8)p(z) where p(z) is a polynomial: such\nfunctions are dense in H0 , and then we can pass to general u by the\n\n\fPERTURBED LANDAU HAMILTONIAN\n\n13\n\nclosure. In the process of our, rather lengthy, calculations we will\nrepeatedly use the commutation relations (2.9) as well as\n \u0304 [Q, h] = \u22122i\u2202h, for h \u2208 C \u221e .\n(3.8)\n[Q, h] = \u22122i\u2202h,\nSo, let us consider the expression kQuk2, u \u2208 H0 . We have\nkQuk2 = (Qu, Qu) = (QQu, u)\n\n(3.9)\n\n= (2B\u25e6 + 2b + QQu, u) = 2B\u25e6 kuk2 + (2bu, u)\n(on the last step we used that Qu = 0). Thus we have Z1 [b] = 2b.\nThe case q = 2 requires some more calculations. We start with\nkQ2 uk2 = (Q2 Q2 u, u).\nThen we are going to commute Q and Q so that only Q, and not Q\nwould act on u, so we will move all copies of Q to the left and all copies\nof Q to the right:\n(Q2 Q2 u, u) = (Q(2B\u25e6 + 2b + QQ)Qu, u) = 2B\u25e6 kQuk2\n\n(3.10)\n\n+2(QbQu, u) + (QQQQu, u).\nThe first term in (3.10) has already the form we aim for, by (3.9). In\nthe second term we commute Q and b using (3.8):\n \u0304\nu).\n(3.11)\n2(QbQu, u) = 2(bQQu, u) + 2(\u22122i(\u2202b)Qu,\nIn the first term in (3.11) we commute Q and Q, and in the second\n \u0304 and Q:\none commute \u22122i(\u2202b)\n2(QbQu, u) = 4(b(B\u25e6 + b)u, u)+\n \u0304\n \u0304\n2(bQQu, u) + 2(Q(\u22122i\u2202b)u,\nu) + (8(\u2202 \u2202b)u,\nu).\nSince Qu = 0, we arrive at\n2(QbQu, u) = 4(b(B\u25e6 + b)u, u) + 2((\u2206b)u, u).\nIn the last term in (3.10) we commute the first pair Q and Q and then\nthe second one:\n(QQQQu, u) = (QQ2 Qu, u) + 2B\u25e6 (QQu, u) + 2(bQQu, u)\n\n(3.12)\n\n= 2B\u25e6 (Qu, Qu) + 4(b(B\u25e6 + b)u, u) + 2(bQQu, u).\nOn the right-hand side of (3.12), the first term is again calculated by\n(3.9), the second term has the required form, and the last one vanishes.\nNow we collect all the transformed terms in (3.10) and obtain\nkQ2 uk2 = 2B\u25e6(2B\u25e6 kuk2 + (2bu, u)) + 4(b(B\u25e6 + b)u, u)+\n2(\u2206bu, u) + 2B\u25e6 (2B\u25e6 kuk2 + (2bu, u)) + 4(b(B\u25e6 + b)u, u)\n= 2(2B\u25e6)2 kuk2 + (Z2 [b]u, u).\nwith\nZ2 [b] = 8b2 + 12B\u25e6 b + 2\u2206b.\n\n\f14\n\nROZENBLUM AND TASHCHIYAN\n\nNow we can formally describe how the procedure goes in the general\ncase. In the expression Qq Qq we start commuting Q and Q, as well as\nthese operators with the functions arising by the previous commutings.\nAll the time we keep moving Q to the right and Q to the left. As soon\nas Q reaches the utmost right position or Q reaches the utmost left\nposition, the corresponding term vanishes. We do this until no operators Q, Q are left, and only a function Cq + Zq [b] remains. To find\nCq and describe the structure of Zq [b], we need only to do some bookkeeping of the terms arising when the operators and/or functions are\ncommuted. The formulas (2.9), (3.8) show that the weight is preserved\nunder commutation. So the constant term Cq has to be proportional to\nB\u25e6 q , and it can arise only when the operators Q, Q are commuted, not\nthe operators with functions. The number of such commutings needed\nto re-arrange all terms equals q!. The term linear in b and not containing derivatives results from the same procedure and has the form\nCq\u2032 B\u25e6 q\u22121 b, Cq\u2032 = 2n q!q. The function Zq [b] arising as a result of moving\nall Q-s to the right and all Q-s to the left will be a polynomial of b\nand its derivatives with weight 2q. The highest derivative of b present\nin Zq [b] will thus be of order 2q \u2212 2, and this term will be linear in b.\nSuch term arises when 2B appears after the first commutation of Q, Q\nin Qq Qq ,\nQq Qq = Qq\u22121 QQQq + Qq\u22121 (2B\u25e6 + 2b)Qq\u22121 ,\nand then q \u2212 1 copies of Q pass 2b on their way to the right and q \u2212 1\ncopies of Q pass it on their way to the left, each such pair producing\nthe Laplacian acting on b.\nThe above reasoning takes care of (3.5). Parts 2) and 3) of the\nproposition are proved in the same way, with a similar bookkeeping in\norder to determine the structure of the resulting functions. We just\ndemonstrate how Part 2) works for q = 1:\n(QUQu, u) = (QQUu, u) + (Q[U, Q]u, u) = (QQUu, u)(= 0)+\n(2BUu, u) + ([U, Q]Qu, u)(= 0) + ([Q, [U, Q]u, u) = (X1 [b, U]u, u);\nX1 [b, U] = 2BU + \u2206U.\n\n\u0003\n\nWhen applying Proposition 3.4 and similar results, we need a certain\ncompactness property. Such facts were used persistently in [13], [11],\n[5], but for the case of a constant magnetic field only.\nLemma 3.5. Let W (x) be a bounded function with compact support.\nThen for any differential operator L with bounded coefficients the quadratic form\nZ\nw[u] =\n\nis compact in the space H0 .\n\nW (x)|Lu|2dx\n\n\fPERTURBED LANDAU HAMILTONIAN\n\n15\n\nRemark 3.6. In section 5 we will find much more detailed information\nabout such forms. However the proof we give here is also useful. We\nreturn to this approach later.\nProof. Let u = e\u2212\u03a8 f be a function in H0 , so f (z) is an analytical\nfunction.\nTake some R such that the support of the function W lies inside the\ncircle CR with radius R centered in the origin. For each r \u2208 (R, 2R)\nwe write the Cauchy representation for f :\nZ\n\u22121\nf (\u03b6)(z \u2212 \u03b6)\u22121 d\u03b6.\n(3.13)\nf (z) = (2\u03c0i)\nCr\n\nR\nThen for some fixed function \u03be(r) \u2208 C0\u221e (R, 2R), \u03be(r)dr = 1, we\nmultiply (3.13) by \u03be(r) and integrate in r from R to 2R. This gives\nRthe integral representation of f (x), |x| < R, in the form f (x) =\nK(x, y)f (y)dy, with smooth bounded kernel K(x, y). After\nR<|y|<2R\napplying L in x variable, we obtain a similar integral representation for\nLu = L(e\u2212\u03a8 f ):\nZ\nLu(x) =\ne\u2212\u03a8(x) K L(x, y)e\u03a8(y) u(y)dy = (KLu)(x).\nR<|y|<2R\n\nThe integral operator |W |1/2 KL has a bounded kernel with compact\nsupport and therefore is compact in L2 , and thus the quadratic form\nw[u] can be written as w[u] = (sign W |W |1/2KLu, |W |1/2 KLu) and\ntherefore it is compact.\n\u0003\nNow we are able to justify our construction of the spaces Gq .\nProposition 3.7. The sets Gq defined in (3.4) are closed subspaces in\nL2 .\nProof. The fact that Gq \u2282 L2 follows directly from Proposition 3.4.\nNext, the relation (3.5) can be written as\n(P0 Qq Qq u, u) = Cq (u, u) + (P0 Zq [b]u, u); u = \u03a80 u \u2208 H0\n\n(3.14)\n\n(recall that P0 is the orthogonal projection onto H0 , P0 u = u). In the\nsecond term in (3.14), by Lemma 3.5, the operator P0 Zq [b] is compact\nin H0 , and therefore we can understand (3.14) as showing that the\noperator Cq\u22121 P0 Qq is a left parametrix for Qq : H0 \u2192 L2 . This implies\n\u0003\nthat the range of Qq is closed.\nThe null space of Q and therefore of Qq is zero. Consider the operator\nQ as acting from G0 = H0 to Gq . This is a bounded invertible operator,\ntherefore the inverse, that we denote by Q\u2212q , is a bounded operator\nfrom Gq to G0 . This inverse operator is a compact perturbation of Qq .\nWe will use Proposition 3.4 and Lemma 3.5 many times throughout\nthe paper. An immediate useful corollary of the latter lemma is the\nfollowing.\nq\n\n\f16\n\nROZENBLUM AND TASHCHIYAN\n\nCorollary 3.8. Under the conditions of Proposition 3.4, for any \u01eb > 0\nthere exists a subspace M \u2282 H0 such that\nkQq vk2 \u2265 (1 \u2212 \u01eb)Cq kvk2 , v \u2208 M,\nand the codimension of M in H0 is finite.\n4. Approximate spectral projections\nThe aim of this section is to prove that the subspaces Gq are very good\napproximations to the actual spectral subspaces Hq of the operator P\u2212 ,\nas well as to the spectral subspaces of P\u2212 (V ). Closeness of subspaces\nwill be measured by closeness of orthogonal projections onto them.\nRecall that the projection onto Hq is denoted by Pq . Let Qq be the\northogonal projection onto Gq .\nTheorem 4.1. The projections Pq and Qq are close: for any N, and\nany collection of the operators Tj , j = 1, . . . , N, each of Tj being Q or\nQ, the operator T (Pq \u2212 Qq )T , is compact, T = T1 T2 . . . TN .\nIn justifying the theorem, we need two technical lemmas which will\nbe proved in Section 7.\nBoth lemmas concern the operator properties of products of many\ncopies of the resolvents of P+ and P\u2212 , the creation and annihilation\noperators Q and Q, functions hj with all derivatives bounded, and,\npossibly, the spectral projection Pq onto Hq . In such product, we assign\norder 1 to Q and Q, order \u22122 to the resolvent, order 0 to functions and\nprojections. The order of the product is defined as the sum of orders\nof factors.\nLemma 4.2. Let the operator A be the product of creation, annihilation\noperators, resolvents, and functions hj , have negative order, and let at\nleast one of the functions hj have compact support. Then A is compact.\nLemma 4.3. Let the operator A be the product of creation, annihilation\noperators, resolvents, functions and a spectral projection Pq . Then A\nis bounded. If, additionally, at least one of the functions has compact\nsupport then A is compact.\nThe proof of the theorem goes in the following way. We construct an\nintermediate operator Sq with range in Gq and prove that Sq is close\nboth to Pq and Qq .\nFor q > 0 we define the operator Sq by the relation\nSq = Cq\u22121 Qq P0 Qq , Cq = q!(2B\u25e6 )q .\n\n(4.1)\n\nSo, our expression for the approximate spectral projection is just a\nnatural modification of the exact formula (2.7) for the unperturbed\noperator. Equivalently, the operator Sq can be described by the formula\nSq = Cq\u22121 GG\u2217 ,\nG = Qq P0 ;\n\n\fPERTURBED LANDAU HAMILTONIAN\n\n17\n\nin Proposition 3.4 this operator is shown to be bounded.\nThe proof of Theorem 4.1 will consist of two parts, showing that Sq\nis close to Pq and showing that it is close to Qq .\nProposition 4.4. The operator Sq is close to the projection Pq .\nProof. We give the detailed proof for q = 1 first, and and then explain\nthe natural changes one should make for larger q.\nWe denote by R\u2212 (\u03b6) the resolvent of the operator P\u2212 ; we also need\nthe resolvent R+ (\u03b6) of the operator P+ . The projection P0 can be\nexpressed via Riesz integral\nZ\n\u22121\nR\u2212 (\u03b6)d\u03b6,\nP0 = (2\u03c0i)\n\u03930\n\nwhere \u03930 is the closed curve, encircling the zero point \u039b0 , defined,\ntogether with curves \u0393q , in Sect.3. We are going to transform the\nexpression for the resolvent R\u2212 (\u03b6) using the commutation relations\n(2.9), (2.10), (2.11), and (3.8). After this, the crucial observation is\nk\nthat the integral of R\u00b1\n, k \u2265 2 along a closed contour vanishes. This\nenables us to dispose of terms that are not compact before integration.\nWe start by writing\nR\u2212 (\u03b6) = (P\u2212 \u2212 \u03b6)\u22121 = (P+ \u2212 2B\u25e6 \u2212 2b \u2212 \u03b6)\u22121.\nNext we use the resolvent equation to get\nR\u2212 (\u03b6) = (P+ \u2212 2B\u25e6 \u2212 \u03b6)\u22121\u2212\n\u22121\n\n\u25e6\n\n(P\u2212 \u2212 \u03b6) (2b)(P+ \u2212 2B \u2212 \u03b6)\n\n\u22121\n\n(4.2)\n\u25e6\n\n= R+ (2B + \u03b6) \u2212 H(\u03b6)\n\nWe multiply (4.2) by Q from the left and by Q from the right, as (4.1)\nrequires. For the first term we use that\nQR+ (2B\u25e6 + \u03b6)Q = Q(QQ \u2212 2B\u25e6 \u2212 \u03b6)\u22121Q =\n\n(4.3)\n\nQQ(QQ \u2212 2B\u25e6 \u2212 \u03b6)\u22121 = P\u2212 R\u2212 (2B\u25e6 + \u03b6).\nIntegration gives\nZ\nZ\n\u25e6\n\u22121\n(P\u2212 \u2212 \u03b6)\u22121 d\u03b6 = 2\u03c0iP\u2212 P1 .\nQ(P\u2212 \u2212 2B \u2212 \u03b6) Qd\u03b6 = P\u2212\n\u03930\n\n\u03931\n\n\u25e6\n\nBy Theorem 2.1, the point \u039b1 = 2B is an isolated point of the essential spectrum of P\u2212 , therefore the nonzero eigenvalues of P\u2212 P1 may\nconverge only to \u039b1 , and thus (P\u2212 \u2212 2B\u25e6 )P1 = P\u2212 P1 \u2212 2B\u25e6 P1 is compact. Moreover, by Proposition 3.3, this compactness is preserved after\nmultiplication by any product of creation and annihilation operators.\nNow we consider the second term, H(\u03b6) in (4.2). We are going to\nshow that for any operator of the type T the integral of T H(\u03b6)T along\n\u03930 is compact. First we apply the resolvent formula (4.2) k times to the\nfirst factor in H(\u03b6), with k large enough. This operation will produce\nterms of order \u22124, \u22126, . . . , containing factors R\u2212 (\u03b6) and b, and the remainder term of order \u22122k containing these factors with, additionally,\n\n\f18\n\nROZENBLUM AND TASHCHIYAN\n\none factor R+ (2B\u25e6 + \u03b6). This last remainder term, for k sufficiently\nlarge, is compact by Lemma 4.2, even after the multiplication by T\nfrom the left and from the right.\nThe leading terms in H(\u03b6), having orders \u22124, \u22126,. . . , will be transformed by repeatedly commuting b and R\u2212 (\u03b6) and then the resulting\ncommutants again with R\u2212 (\u03b6) and so on. Under commuting R\u2212 (\u03b6)\nwith a function, with Q, or with Q, this factor R\u2212 (\u03b6) moves to the left\nor to the right, and one more product in the sum composing T H(\u03b6)T\narises, of order lower by 1. In this commuting procedure we aim for\ncollecting the factors R\u2212 (\u03b6) together. As soon as a term with all R\u2212 (\u03b6)\nstanding together arises, we leave it alone and do not transform any\nmore. After sufficiently many commutations, we arrive at a collection of\nterms in T H(\u03b6)T of negative order, which are compact by Lemma 4.2.\nThe terms of nonnegative order, the ones to which this Lemma cannot be applied, will have the form G1 R\u2212 (\u03b6)k G2 with k > 1 and some\noperators G1 , G2 . These terms vanish after integration over \u03930 .\nNow we demonstrate in detail how this procedure works. Let T = 1.\nFor the case q = 1, which we are considering at the moment, it suffices\nto apply (4.2) twice and write\nH(\u03b6) = 2R\u2212 (\u03b6)bR+ (2B\u25e6 + \u03b6) = 2R\u2212 (\u03b6)bR\u2212 (\u03b6)\n\n(4.4)\n\n\u22124R\u2212 (\u03b6)bR\u2212 (\u03b6)bR+ (2B\u25e6 + \u03b6).\nWe multiply (4.4) by Q and Q, as (4.1) requires, and then the last term\ntakes the form QR\u2212 (\u03b6)bR\u2212 (\u03b6)bR+ (2B\u25e6 + \u03b6)Q. This is an operator of\norder \u22122, containing as a factor the compactly supported function b,\nso it is compact for any \u03b6 \u2208 \u03931 by Lemma 4.2. As for the first term\nin (4.4), we handle it in the following way (we suppress \u03b6 as long as it\ndoes not cause a misunderstanding)\n2\n2\nR\u2212 bR\u2212 = bR\u2212\n\u2212 R\u2212 [P\u2212 , b]R\u2212\n=\n\n(4.5)\n\n2\n3\n3\nbR\u2212\n\u2212 [P\u2212 , b]R\u2212\n+ R\u2212 [P\u2212 , [P\u2212 , b]]R\u2212\n\n(we used here that [R\u2212 , L] = \u2212R\u2212 [P\u2212 , L]R\u2212 for any operator L.)\nAgain we multiply (4.5) by Q and Q. In the first and the second\nterms on the right-hand side all entries of the resolvent are collected\ntogether, so these terms vanish after the integration; the last one has\norder \u22124 and is compact by Lemma 4.2. If the operator T is present,\nwe continue expanding (4.4) sufficiently long:\nH(\u03b6) = 2R\u2212 (\u03b6)bR+ (2B\u25e6 + \u03b6) = 2R\u2212 bR\u2212\n\u25e6\n\n\u22124R\u2212 bR\u2212 bR+ (2B + \u03b6) . . .\n=\n\nk\nX\nj=1\n\n(\u22122R\u2212 b)j R\u2212 + (\u22122R\u2212 b)k+1 R+ (2B\u25e6 + \u03b6).\n\n(4.6)\n\n\fPERTURBED LANDAU HAMILTONIAN\n\n19\n\nWe choose k large enough, so that the last term in (4.6) will be of negative order even after the multiplication by T . In all remaining terms\nin (4.6) we commute R\u2212 with other operators, moving all factors R\u2212\nsay, to the right. For example, the term R\u2212 bR\u2212 bR\u2212 will be handled\nin the following way\n2\n2\nR\u2212 bR\u2212 bR\u2212 = bR\u2212\nbR\u2212 + R\u2212 [b, P\u2212 ]R\u2212\nbR\u2212\n2\n2\n2\n= bR\u2212 bR\u2212\n+ bR\u2212\n[b, P\u2212 ]R\u2212 bR\u2212 + R\u2212 [b, P\u2212 ]R\u2212\nbR\u2212 .\n\nThe second and third terms in the last line are operators of order \u22127,\nand they stay compact after multiplication by four operators Q, Q,\nwhich gives compactness of corresponding terms in T QH(z)QT for an\noperator T containing just one factor. The first term in the last line\nhas order \u22126, so we have to make one more commutation:\n2\n3\n3\nbR\u2212 bR\u2212\n= b2 R\u2212\n+ bR\u2212 [b, P\u2212 ]R\u2212\n.\n\n(4.7)\n\nNow the first term in (4.7) vanishes after integration, and the second\none has order \u22127. If the operator T contains more terms, we have to\ncontinue commuting, moving the factors R\u2212 to the right. If there is a\nseparately standing R\u2212 in some term, we can move it to the right, and\nthe order of the term with commutant decreases by one. We cannot\ndo this and, correspondingly, decrease the order, only if all R\u2212 stand\ntogether, but such terms vanish after the integration. This reasoning\nestablishes our property for S1 .\nNow we explain how one handles the operators Sq , q > 1. It is\nconvenient to use the induction in q. So, supposing that for all q < p\nthe compactness is proved, we start transforming the expression (4.1)\nfor q = p. First we extract the principal term. We write, using (4.2),\nQp R\u2212 (\u03b6)Qp = Qp (R+ (2B\u25e6 + \u03b6) \u2212 H(\u03b6))Qp .\n\n(4.8)\n\nThe term H(\u03b6) produces a compact contribution, in the same way as\nfor p = 1. For the leading term in (4.8) we use (4.3):\nQp R+ (2B\u25e6 + \u03b6)Qp = Qp\u22121 P\u2212 R\u2212 (2B\u25e6 + \u03b6)Qp\u22121 .\nWe commute Qp\u22121 and P\u2212 in the last expression to get\nQp R+ (2B\u25e6 + \u03b6)Qp = P\u2212 Qp\u22121 R\u2212 (2B\u25e6 + \u03b6)Qp\u22121+\n\n(4.9)\n\n[Qp\u22121 , P\u2212 ]R\u2212 (2B\u25e6 + \u03b6)Qp\u22121.\nThe first term in (4.9) has the form, similar to the one we have started\nwith in (4.8), just with p replaced by p\u22121, and the inductive assumption\ncan be applied. The commutator [Qq\u22121 , P\u2212 ] in the second term in (4.9)\nis the sum of p \u2212 1 expressions of the form\nQj [Q, P\u2212 ]Qq\u22122\u2212j = 2B\u25e6 Qp\u22121 + 2Qj+1 bQp\u22122\u2212j , j = 0, . . . , p \u2212 2.\n(4.10)\n\n\f20\n\nROZENBLUM AND TASHCHIYAN\n\nThis gives additionally p \u2212 1 terms of the form 2B\u25e6 Qp\u22121 R\u2212 (2B\u25e6 +\n\u03b6)Qp\u22121 in our integrand. So we have transformed Qp R+ (2B\u25e6 + \u03b6)Qp\nto (2(p \u2212 1)B\u25e6 + P\u2212 )Qp\u22121 R\u2212 (2B\u25e6 + \u03b6)Qp\u22121 plus remainder terms.\nAfter p such steps we arrive at the expression\np\nY\n(2(p \u2212 j)B\u25e6 + P\u2212 ),\nMR\u2212 (2pB + \u03b6); M =\n\u25e6\n\nj=1\n\nwhich, after the change of variables \u03b6 \u2032 = 2pB\u25e6 +\u03b6 and integration along\n\u0393p , gives 2\u03c0iMPp . The latter operator is a compact perturbation of\n2\u03c0iCp Pp , by Proposition 3.1, and, as usual, this perturbation remains\ncompact after multiplication by T .\nThe remainder terms arising in the expressions similar to (4.8), are\ntaken care of by means of Lemma 4.2, as in the case of q = 1: they\ncontain at least two resolvents separated by a function and the commutation procedure succeeds. Another kind of remainders are the ones\nobtained in the relations similar to (4.10), substituted into (4.9). They\ncontain only one resolvent. However after the integration such terms\ntake the form T \u2032 P T \u2032\u2032 where P is one of projections Pq , and T \u2032 , T \u2032\u2032 are\nproducts of creation, annihilation operators and functions, moreover at\nleast one of these functions has compact support. By Lemma 4.3, such\noperators are compact.\n\u0003\nSo we have proved that the operator Sq is close to the projection Pq .\nProposition 4.5. The operator Sq is close to the projection Qq onto\nthe approximate spectral subspace Gq .\nProof. First of all, since the operator Sq is a self-adjoint operator close\nto some projection, it must have the essential spectrum as any projection has, this means, consisting only of the points 0 and 1. Moreover,\nsince the range of Sq lies in Gq , the operator Sq has Gq as an invariant subspace and it annuls the orthogonal complement to Gq . So\nwe may consider Sq in Gq . We are going to show first that zero is\nnot a limit point of nonzero eigenvalues of Sq ; this will imply that\nzero is an isolated point of the spectrum of Sq and the range of Sq\nis closed in Gq . To show this, we consider the self-adjoint operator\nCq\u22121 G\u2217 G : H0 \u2192 H0 , G = Qq P0 . By Proposition 3.4 and Lemma 3.5,\nthis operator is bounded, and, moreover,\nCq\u22121 G\u2217 G = P0 (1 + K)P0\n\n(4.11)\n\nwith a compact operator K. This implies that the point 0 is an isolated\npoint of the spectrum of Cq\u22121 G\u2217 G : H0 \u2192 H0 , and therefore 0 is an\nisolated point of the spectrum of Sq = Cq\u22121 GG\u2217 . So the range of Sq is\nclosed. Further on, it follows from (4.11) that G\u2217 = P0 Qq : Gq \u2192 H0\nhas range of finite codimension in H0 , and since Qq maps H0 onto\nGq (by the definition of the latter space), the range of Sq has finite\n\n\fPERTURBED LANDAU HAMILTONIAN\n\n21\n\ncodimension in Gq . These properties, taken together, imply that Sq\nis a compact perturbation of the projection Qq acting in the range\nof Qq , Sq = Qq (1 + K1 )Qq , with a compact operator K1 . Since the\nrange of Sq has finite co-dimension in Gq , this relation can also be\nwritten as Sq \u2212 Qq = Sq K2 Sq + F with a compact operator K2 and F\nhaving finite rank. By Lemma 4.3, the operator Sq stays bounded after\nmultiplication by any collection of creation and annihilation operators,\nand this establishes closeness of Sq and Qq .\n\u0003\nPropositions 4.4 and 4.5, taken together, prove Theorem 4.1.\nNow we add a perturbation by a compactly supported smooth electric potential V (x). We are going to show that under such perturbation the spectral subspaces 'almost' do not change. This observation\njustifies the usual physical intuition hinting that in the first order of\nperturbation theory only the eigenvalues change, while the spectral\nsubspaces change only in the second order. Note that by our construction of the approximate spectral subspaces we have shown that this\nphysical intuition is wrong in the case of a magnetic perturbation.\nNote, first of all, that the perturbation of P\u2212 by V is relatively\ncompact, therefore, again, the spectrum of the operator P\u2212 (V ) = P\u2212 +\nV between Landau levels is discrete. We can change the contours \u0393q a\nlittle, so that they do not pass through the eigenvalues of P\u2212 (V ). We\ndenote by HqV the spectral subspaces of P\u2212 (V ) corresponding to the\nspectrum inside \u0393q , by PqV the corresponding spectral projections, and\nV\nby R\u2212\n(\u03b6) the resolvent of P\u2212 (V ).\nProposition 4.6. The projections PqV and Qq are close in the sense\nused in Theorem 4.1.\nProof. We will prove that the projection PqV is close to Pq , then the\nresult will follow from Theorem 4.1.\nWe use the representation of projections by means of resolvents,\nZ\nV\nV\n\u22121\nR\u2212\n(\u03b6)d\u03b6.\nPq = (2\u03c0i)\n\u0393q\n\nThe similar expression for Pq and the resolvent formula give\nZ\nV\nV\n\u22121\nR\u2212 (\u03b6)V R\u2212\n(\u03b6)d\u03b6 =\nPq \u2212 Pq = \u2212(2\u03c0i)\n\n(4.12)\n\n\u0393q\n\n(2\u03c0i)\n\n\u22121\n\n2N\n\u22121 Z\nX\nk=1\n\n+(2\u03c0i)\u22121\n\nZ\n\n\u0393q\n\n(\u2212R\u2212 (\u03b6)V )k R\u2212 (\u03b6)d\u03b6\n\n\u0393q\n\nV\n(\u2212R\u2212 (\u03b6)V )N R\u2212\n(\u03b6)(\u2212V R\u2212 (\u03b6))N d\u03b6.\n\nThe last term in (4.12) is compact and stays compact after the multiplication by the creation and annihilation operators, as soon as N\nis large enough, by Lemma 4.2. With the leading terms in (4.12), we\n\n\f22\n\nROZENBLUM AND TASHCHIYAN\n\ncan perform the same procedure as when proving Proposition 4.4. We\ncommute the resolvent with V and with the terms arising by commutation and so on, aiming to collect the resolvents together all the time.\nAs a results we arrive at a number of terms of sufficiently negative order, thus compact before the integration, and terms with all resolvents\ncollected together, and thus vanishing after the integration.\n\u0003\n5. Spectrum of Toeplitz-type operators\nWe move on to the study of the splitting of Landau levels of our\noperators. Similar to [13], [11], [5], the properties of the eigenvalues of\nthe perturbed operators depend on the properties of the spectrum of\ncertain Toeplitz-type operators.\nUsually, by Toeplitz operator one understands an operator of the\nform TW = P W P where P is the orthogonal projection onto some\nsubspace G in L2 and W is the operator of multiplication by some\nfunction. Alternatively, if we consider the Toeplitz operator in G the\noperator can be written as TW = P W .\nIn [13], [11] such operators were considered, with G being one of\nLandau subspaces and the electric potential V acting as W . Later,\nin [5], Toeplitz type operators at the lowest LL were considered, with\nsome differential operators acting as W . We will study this latter kind\nof Toeplitz type operators, with the space H0 of zero modes of the\nperturbed Pauli operator acting as G.\nWe recall that the projection onto the space H0 = G0 of zero modes\nof P\u2212 is denoted by P0 . We consider linear\nP differential operators L of\norder l with bounded coefficients, Lu = \u03b1+\u03b2\u2264l p\u03b1\u03b2 \u22021\u03b1 \u22022\u03b2 u. We suppose\nthat all coefficients p\u03b1\u03b2 have compact support in the disk |x| \u2264 R and\n|p\u03b1\u03b2 | \u2264 M. With any such operator L we associate the Toeplitz-type\noperator in H0 :\nTLv = P0 L\u2217 Lv, v \u2208 H0 .\nThis operator corresponds to the quadratic form\nZ\nL\nt [u] = |Lu|2 dx, u \u2208 H0 .\nWe are going to study the spectrum of TL . We denote by \u03bb\u00b1\nn =\n\u00b1\nL\n\u03bbn (L) positive, resp., negative eigenvalues of the operator T . The\ndistribution functions n\u00b1 (\u03bb), \u03bb > 0, are defined as n\u00b1 (\u03bb) = n\u00b1 (\u03bb; L) =\nL\n#{n : \u00b1\u03bb\u00b1\nn (L) > \u03bb}. The singular numbers sn (L) of the operator T\n\u00b1\nare just the absolute values of \u03bbn ordered non-increasingly, and their\ndistribution function equals n(\u03bb; L) = n+ (\u03bb; L) + n\u2212 (\u03bb, L). We denote\n\u03bb|\nby \u039e(\u03bb) the function 21 ln| ln\n.\n| ln \u03bb|\nProposition 5.1. For an operator L with bounded compactly supported\ncoefficients,\nlim sup n\u00b1 (\u03bb; L)\u039e(\u03bb)\u22121 \u2264 1.\n(5.1)\n\u03bb\u21920\n\n\fPERTURBED LANDAU HAMILTONIAN\n\n23\n\nThe estimate (5.1) means that the eigenvalues of TL converge to zero\nextremely rapidly, super-exponentially:\n1\n\nn\nlim sup(n!\u03bb\u00b1\nn (L)) < \u221e.\n\n(5.2)\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nThe estimates (5.1), (5.2) do not exclude the possibility that the operator TL has only a finite number of positive and/or negative eigenvalues,\ncounting multiplicity.\nProof. We start by proving a special version of the proposition, dealing with the case when the operator L is just the multiplication by a\nbounded compactly supported function W . The corresponding Toeplitz\noperator will be denoted by TW\nWe apply the classical variational approach. Consider the quadratic\nform tW [v] of the operator TW :\nZ\nW\nt [v] = W (x)|v(x)|2 dx, v \u2208 H0 .\nThe variational description of eigenvalues (Glazman lemma) implies\nn+ (\u03bb; W ) = min codim {L \u2282 H0 : tW [v] \u2264 \u03bbkvk2 , v \u2208 L}.\nWe recall the description of the space H0 to get\nn+ (\u03bb; W ) = min codim {M \u2282 F b : tW [e\u2212\u03a8 f ] \u2264 \u03bbke\u2212\u03a8 f k2 , f \u2208 M},\n(5.3)\nb\nwhere F is the space of entire analytical functions, defined in Sect.2.\nNow we are going to estimate the quantity in (5.3) from above by\nmeans of changing the forms and the spaces. First, if we replace\nke\u2212\u03a8 f k2 in (5.3) by something smaller, then there will be fewer subspaces M where the inequality holds and therefore min codim may be\u25e6\ncome only larger. So we can replace ke\u2212\u03a8 f k2 by Cke\u2212(1+\u01eb)\u03a8 f k2 where\n\u03a8\u25e6 is the potential defined in (2.3) and C is some constant, since, due to\n\u25e6\nour estimates of \u03a8, discussed in Sect.3, e\u2212\u03a8 \u2265 Ce\u2212(1+\u01eb)\u03a8 . After this,\nif we replace the enveloping space F b in (5.3) by a larger one, F(1+\u01eb)B\u25e6 ,\nthen the codimension of subspaces may only grow. Therefore, we arrive\nat\nn+ (\u03bb, W ) \u2264\n\n(5.4)\n\u2212(1+\u01eb)\u03a8\u25e6\n\nf k2 , f \u2208 M}.\nmin codim {M \u2282 F(1+\u01eb)B\u25e6 : tW [e\u2212\u03a8 f ] \u2264 \u03bbkCe\nR\nNow we notice that tW [e\u2212\u03a8 f ] = W e\u22122\u03a8 |f |2dx, and W e\u22122\u03a8 is again\na bounded function with compact support. Therefore we can apply\nestimates for the right-hand side in (5.4) established in [13], Proposition 3.2 or [11], Lemma 6.1, which lead to the inequality (5.1).\nThe estimate we have just established can even be improved, if we\nuse the results of [5] to majorize the right-hand side in (5.4):\n1\nB\u25e6\n\u00b1\nn\nlim sup(n!\u03bbn (W )) \u2264\nCap (supp W ),\n2\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n\f24\n\nROZENBLUM AND TASHCHIYAN\n\nwhere Cap (supp W ) is the logarithmical capacity of the support of W .\nNow we pass to the general case. Let all coefficients p\u03b1\u03b2 of the\noperator L have support in the disk with radius R centered at 0 and\n|p\u03b1\u03b2 | \u2264 M.\nDenote by \u03c7 the characteristic function of the disk D of radius 2R.\nBy Cauchy integral formula, applied as in Lemma 3.5, each term of the\nform p\u03b1\u03b2 \u22021\u03b1 \u22022\u03b2 u, u \u2208 H0 can be expressed as T\u03b1\u03b2 (\u03c7u), with a bounded\noperator T\u03b1\u03b2 . The upper bound for the norm of this operator depends\nonly on the order of derivatives \u03b1 + \u03b2, on the size of the coefficient p\u03b1\u03b2\nand on the radius R. P\nSince the quadraticP\nform tL of the operator TL\nL\n\u03b1 \u03b2\n2\nhas the form t [u] = k p\u03b1\u03b2 \u22021 \u22021 uk = k p\u03b1\u03b2 \u22021\u03b1 \u22021\u03b2 \u03c7uk2 , we have\n|tL[u]| \u2264 \u03ba \u22121 k\u03c7uk2 = \u03ba \u22121 t\u03c7 [u], u \u2208 H0\n\n(5.5)\n\nfor a certain \u03ba. Thus the singular numbers of the operator TL are\nmajorated by the ones of the operator TW with W = \u03c7, and for such\noperators the required estimate is already proved.\n\u0003\nIt is more convenient for our needs to formulate Proposition 5.1,\ndirectly in the variational form, declaring the existence of subspaces\nwith prescribed properties.\nProposition 5.2. There exists a constant \u03ba depending only on l, R, M,\nsuch that for any \u01eb > 0 and for any \u03bb > 0, sufficiently small, there exists a subspace M(\u03bb) \u2208 H0 such that the codimension of M(\u03bb) is no\ngreater than (1 + \u01eb)\u039e(\u03bb), and for any order l differential operator L\nwith coefficients p\u03b1\u03b2 supported in the disk with radius R and satisfying\n|p\u03b1\u03b2 | \u2264 M\ntL[u] \u2264 \u03ba\u03bbkuk2 , u \u2208 M(\u03bb).\n\n(5.6)\n\nThe important feature in this formulation is that the subspace M(\u03bb)\nof controlled codimension can be chosen in such way that it services\nsimultaneously all Toeplitz-like operators generated by differential operators L of fixed order and with coefficients subject to the above restrictions.\nProof. By (5.5), as soon as the chosen subspace M(\u03bb) services the\nToeplitz operator T\u03c7 , the inequality (5.6) holds for all operators L\nsubject to our conditions.\n\u0003\nWe formulate the eigenvalue estimate from below for operators TW\nonly, under the condition that the function W is non-negative. This\nlatter condition can be somewhat relaxed, however some kind of positivity requirements still remain. In fact, starting from [13], [11], the\npositivity condition for lower spectral estimates remains a serious obstacle in this field.\n\n\fPERTURBED LANDAU HAMILTONIAN\n\n25\n\nProposition 5.3. Let the function W be non-negative and be greater\nthan some c > 0 on an open set. Then\nlim inf n+ (\u03bb; W )\u039e(\u03bb)\u22121 \u2265 1.\n\u03bb\u21920\n\nProof. We use the variational description of n\u00b1 (\u03bb; W ):\nn+ (\u03bb; W ) = max dim{L \u2282 H0 : t0 [v] < \u03bbkvk2 , v \u2208 L, v 6= 0}. (5.7)\nAgain, using the description of the space H0 of zero modes, we can\nrewrite (5.7) as\nn+ (\u03bb; W ) = max dim{M \u2282 F b : t0 [e\u2212\u03a8 f ] > \u03bbke\u2212\u03a8 f k2 , f \u2208 M, f 6= 0}\n(5.8)\n\u2212\u03a8\n2\nBy replacing ke f k by some larger quantity, we narrow the choice\nof subspaces M where the inequality in (5.8) holds. So, we replace\n\u25e6\nke\u2212\u03a8 f k2 by kCe\u2212(1\u2212\u01eb)\u03a8 f k2 with an arbitrary \u01eb \u2208 (0, 1) and some C.\nThis leads to decreasing of the right-hand side of (5.8). A further\ndecreasing is obtained by narrowing the enveloping space: we replace\nF b by F(1\u2212\u01eb)B\u25e6 . This transforms the right-hand side in (5.8) to the\nform, where the estimate from below is already proved, again in [13],\nProposition 3.2 or [11], Lemma 6.1.\n\u0003\nWe will need the uniform variational version of the latter estimate.\nProposition 5.4. Let \u03a9 be an open set, c > 0. Then for any \u01eb > 0 and\nfor any \u03bb > 0, small enough, depending on \u01eb there exists a subspace\nL = L(\u03bb) \u2282 H0 such that (W v, v) > \u03bbkvk2 , v \u2208 L \\ {0} for all\nfunctions W \u2265 0 satisfying W \u2265 c on \u03a9 and dim L(\u03bb) \u2265 (1 \u2212 \u01eb)\u039e(\u03bb).\nThe result follows from the estimate (W v, v) \u2265 c(\u03c7\u03a9 v, v).\n6. Perturbed eigenvalues\nThe passage from the spectral estimates for Toeplitz-type operators\nto the ones for the Pauli operator has been performed in a different way\nin [12], [13] and in [11]. A short and neat reasoning in [12], [13] based\nupon the proper version of the Birman-Schwinger principle requires\npositivity of the perturbing operator which fails to be positive in our\ncase. Therefore we follow the approach of [11], Sect. 9, using variational\nconsiderations, however certain new features appear.\nThe particular form of the variational principle we use, derived immediately from the spectral theorem, is the following. For a self-adjoint\noperator A and an interval (s, r) in the real axis we denote by N(s, r; A)\nthe total multiplicity of the spectrum of A in (s, r); when this quantity is finite, it is the number of eigenvalues of A in (s, r), counting\nmultiplicities.\n\n\f26\n\nROZENBLUM AND TASHCHIYAN\n\nProposition 6.1. Let A be a self-adjoint operator with domain D(A).\nThen, for s < r,\nN(s, r; A)\n\b\n= max dim L \u2282 D(A) : k(A \u2212 \u03bc)uk2 < \u03c4 2 kuk2, u \u2208 L\\{0}\n\b\n= min codim L \u2282 D(A) : k(A\u2212\u03bc)uk2 \u2265 \u03c4 2 kuk2, u \u2208 L ,\n\n(6.1)\n(6.2)\n\nwhere \u03bc = (r + s)/2 and \u03c4 = (r \u2212 s)/2.\n\nWhen using Proposition 6.1, one looks for a subspace L where the\ninequality in (6.1) is fulfilled. The dimension of this subspace gives an\nestimate from below for N(s, r; A). On the other hand, having found\na subspace L where the inequality in (6.2) is satisfied, we can be sure\nthat the codimension of this subspace estimates N(s, r; A) from above.\nConsidering perturbations of the Landau Hamiltonian by general\nelectric and magnetic fields, we should accept the possibility that the\neigenvalues may split away from the Landau level both up and down.\nTherefore we need rather advanced notations. We fix a Landau level\n\u039b = \u039bq = 2qB\u25e6 and set s\u00b1 = \u039b \u00b1B\u25e6. For given \u03bb \u2208 (0, B\u25e6/4) we define\n\u03bc\u00b1 = (\u039b \u00b1 \u03bb + s\u00b1 )/2, \u03c4 = 21 B\u25e6 \u2212 \u03bb2 . Thus, \u03bc\u00b1 is the midpoint of the\ninterval between \u039b \u00b1 \u03bb and s\u00b1 , \u03c4 is the half-length of this interval. For\nthe perturbation given by an operator V we denote by N+ (\u03bb; q, b, V)\nthe eigenvalue counting function N(\u039bq +\u03bb, s+ ; P\u2212 +V) where P\u2212 is the\nPauli operator with magnetic field B = B\u25e6 +b; similarly, N\u2212 (\u03bb; q, b, V)\nis defined as N(s\u2212 , \u039bq \u2212\u03bb; P\u2212 +V). Thus, N+ , N\u2212 count the eigenvalues\nconverging to \u039b from above, resp., from below.\n6.1. Upper estimate. We start with the upper estimate. It declares\nthat the eigenvalues split away from the Landau level at least superexponentially rapidly. This estimate is rather robust: is does not require\nmuch smoothness of the perturbing magnetic field or of the electric\npotential. It is convenient to keep all the previous notations in the\npaper for a smooth case, and use the superscript \u266f for the non-smooth\nversions.\nSo, let b\u266f \u2208 C02 (R2 ) be a magnetic field with compact support, \u03c8 \u266f \u2208\n4\nC be its scalar potential, \u2206\u03c8 \u266f = b\u266f , and a\u266f \u2208 C 3 its vector potential.\nThe Pauli operator associated to the field B\u25e6 + b\u266f will be denoted by\nP\u266f\u2212 .\nWe consider the smoothened magnetic field, b =R \u03c9 \u2217 b\u266f , where\n\u03c9 \u2208 C0\u221e is a smooth function with compact support, \u03c9dx = 1, and\n\u03c9(x) depends only on |x|. Thus the field b is smooth and compactly\nsupported. Of course, \u03c8 = \u03c9 \u2217 \u03c8 \u266f is a potential for b, \u2206\u03c8 = b. Moreover, since \u03c8 \u266f is a harmonic function outside the support of b\u266f , by\nthe mean value property, \u03c8 coincides with \u03c8 \u266f outside some compact.\nCorrespondingly the vector potential a of the field b coincides with a\u266f\noutside a compact.\n\n\fPERTURBED LANDAU HAMILTONIAN\n\n27\n\nAs a result, the Pauli operator P\u266f\u2212 can be expressed as\nP\u266f\u2212 = P\u2212 + M,\nwhere P\u2212 is the Pauli operator with smooth magnetic field B = B\u25e6 +b\nand M is a first order differential operator with C 2 -coefficients having\ncompact support.\nFurther on, we consider the operator P\u266f\u2212 + V as a perturbation of\nP\u2212 ,\nP\u266f\u2212 + V = P\u2212 + V, V = M + V, V \u2208 C02 (R2 ).\nNow we can formulate the main upper estimate.\nTheorem 6.2. If the perturbations b\u266f and V belong to C02 (R2 ) then\nlim sup N\u00b1 (\u03bb, P\u266f\u2212 + V )\u039e(\u03bb)\u22121 \u2264 1.\n\n(6.3)\n\n\u03bb\u21920+\n\nProof. We will prove the 'minus' version of the Theorem; the 'plus'\nversion differs just by non-essential details. Keeping in mind Proposition 6.1, we are going to construct a subspace L in the domain of the\noperator P\u2212 such that the inequality\nk(P\u2212 + V \u2212 \u03bc)uk2 \u2265 \u03c4 2 kuk2\nholds for all u \u2208 L, and estimate its codimension.\nWe represent an arbitrary function u as u = u1 + u2 where u1 \u2208\nG = Gq belongs to the approximate spectral subspace constructed in\nSection 3 and u2 belongs to the subspace \u011c orthogonal to G, u1 = Qq u,\nu2 = Q\u0302q u, Q\u0302q = 1 \u2212 Qq .\nThen the inequality we aim for takes the form\nk(P\u2212 + V \u2212 \u03bc)(u1 + u2 )k2 \u2212 \u03c4 2 ku1k2 \u2212 \u03c4 2 ku2 k2 \u2265 0.\n\n(6.4)\n\nThe left-hand side in (6.4) can be written as\n[k(P\u2212 + V \u2212 \u03bc)u1k2 \u2212 \u03c4 2 ku1 k2 ] + [k(P\u2212 + V \u2212 \u03bc)u2 k2 \u2212 \u03c4 2 ku2 k2 ]\n+2R((P\u2212 + V \u2212 \u03bc)u1, (P\u2212 + V \u2212 \u03bc)u2 ).\n\n(6.5)\n\nFollowing the pattern of the proof of Proposition 9.2 in [11], we are\ngoing to find subspaces of controlled codimension in G and in \u011c, where\nthe first and the second terms in (6.5) are positive, with some margin,\nwhile the third term in (6.5) is majorized by this margin.\nThe first term. We start with the first term. Since u1 \u2208 G, by our\nconstruction, u1 can be written in a unique way as u1 = Qq v1 , v1 \u2208 H0 ,\nand thus the term takes the form\nk(P\u2212 + V \u2212 \u03bc)u1 k2 \u2212 \u03c4 2 ku1k2 = k(P\u2212 + V \u2212 \u03bc)Qq v1 k2 \u2212 \u03c4 2 kQq v1 k2\n(6.6)\n= k(P\u2212 \u2212 \u03bc)Qq v1 k2 \u2212 \u03c4 2 kQq v1 k2 + 2R((P\u2212 \u2212 \u03bc)Qq v1 , VQq v1 )\n+(VQq v1 , VQq v1 ).\n\n\f28\n\nROZENBLUM AND TASHCHIYAN\n\nThe first two terms in (6.6) can be transformed by means of Proposition 3.4; they produce Cq ((\u039b \u2212 \u03bc)2 \u2212 \u03c4 2 )kv1 k2 as well as Cq (W1 v1 , v1 )\nwith some compactly supported function W1 . The last term is nonnegative and can be ignored when estimating the whole expression\nfrom below. As for the remaining, next to last term in (6.6), we have\n2R((P\u2212 \u2212 \u03bc)Qq v1 , VQq v1 ) \u2265 \u2212(k\u03c7L1 v1 k2 + kL2 v1 k2 ),\nwhere \u03c7L1 , L2 are order q + 2 and order q + 1 differential operators\nwith bounded compactly supported coefficients, L1 = (P\u2212 \u2212 \u03bc)Qq ,\nL2 = VQq , and \u03c7 is a characteristic function of an open set containing\nthe support of coefficients of V, so that \u03c7V = V.\nAs a result, we obtain\nk(P\u2212 + V \u2212 \u03bc)u1 k2 \u2212 \u03c4 2 ku1k2 \u2265 Cq ((\u039b \u2212 \u03bc)2 \u2212 \u03c4 2 )kv1 k2\n2\n\n(6.7)\n\n2\n\n+(W v1 , v1 ) \u2212 k\u03c7L1 v1 k \u2212 kL2 v1 k .\nThe expression ((\u039b \u2212 \u03bc)2 \u2212 \u03c4 2 ) equals (\u039b \u2212 \u03bc \u2212 \u03c4 )(\u039b \u2212 \u03bc + \u03c4 ) =\n\u03bb(\u039b \u2212 s). Now we are going to chose our first subspace. We fix \u01eb \u2208\n(0, 13 ). By Proposition 5.2, there exists a subspace M 1 in H0 such that\n1\n\u03bb(\u039b \u2212 s)kv1 k2\n|(W v1 , v1 )|, k\u03c7L1 v1 k2 , kL2 v1 k2 are all no greater than 10\n1\nand the codimension of M 1 in H0 is less than (1 + \u01eb)\u039e( 10\n(\u039b \u2212 s)\u03bb)\nfor \u03bb small enough. So, for v1 \u2208 M 1 the right-hand side of (6.7)\nis no less than 34 Cq (\u039b \u2212 s)\u03bbkv1 k2 . This means that on the subspace\nL 1 = Qq M 1 , which has the same codimension in G as M 1 has in\nH0 , the left hand side of (6.7) is no less than 43 Cq (\u039b \u2212 s)\u03bbkv1 k2 . The\noperator Qq : H0 \u2192 G is boundedly invertible, so we can majorize\nkv1 k by ||u1||, as in Corollary 3.8, therefore, for some constant c1 , not\ndepending on \u01eb, \u03bb,\nk(P\u2212 + V \u2212 \u03bc)u1k2 \u2212 \u03c4 2 ku1 k \u2265 c1 \u03bbku1 k2 , u1 \u2208 L 1 .\n1\n(\u039b \u2212s)\u03bb)\nThe subspace L 1 has codimension no greater than (1 + \u01eb)\u039e( 10\nin G.\nThe second term. In the next term in (6.5), k(P\u2212 \u2212 \u03bc + V)u2k2\n\u2212\u03c4 2 ku2 k2 , we can write u2 = (1\u2212Qq )u2 = (1\u2212Pq )u2 +(Pq \u2212Qq )u2 where\nPq is the spectral projection of P\u2212 corresponding to the neighborhood\n\u03b4q = (\u039b \u2212 \u03b3, \u039b + \u03b3) of \u039b = \u039bq , defined in Section 3. We denote by P\u0303\nthe spectral projection of P\u2212 corresponding to the set (s \u2212 B\u25e6 /2, \u039b \u2212\n\u03b3] \u222a [\u039b + \u03b3, \u039b + B\u25e6 ). Since the spectrum of P\u2212 is discrete in (\u039b \u2212\n2B\u25e6 , \u039b) \u2229 (\u039b, \u039b + 2B\u25e6 ), the projection P\u0303 has finite rank, and thus u2\ncan be expressed as\n\nu2 = (1 \u2212 Pq \u2212 P\u0303 )u2 + (Pq \u2212 Qq + P\u0303 )u2 = g + h.\n\n(6.8)\n\nConstructed as above, the function g is lying in the spectral subspace\nof P\u2212 corresponding to the exterior of the interval (\u039b\u22123B\u25e6 /2, \u039b+B\u25e6).\nSo, by means of the spectral theorem, we can estimate k(P\u2212 \u2212 \u03bc)gk\n\n\fPERTURBED LANDAU HAMILTONIAN\n\n29\n\nfrom below as k(P\u2212 \u2212 \u03bc)gk \u2265 (\u03c4 + B\u25e6 /2)kgk. Therefore\nk(P\u2212 \u2212 \u03bc)gk2 \u2212 \u03c4 2 kgk2 \u2265 c2 kgk2,\n\n(6.9)\n\nk(P\u2212 \u2212 \u03bc)gk2 \u2212 \u03c4 2 kgk2 \u2265 c3 k(P\u2212 \u2212 \u03bc)gk2\n\n(6.10)\n\nas well as\n\nwith some constants c2 , c3 not depending on \u03bb.\nNow let us consider h = (Pq \u2212 Qq + P\u0303 )u2 . As we have proved\nin Section 4, the operator Pq \u2212 Qq is compact and remains compact\nafter multiplication by any combination of creation and annihilation\noperators. This property remains intact after adding the finite rank\noperator P\u0303 . So, we can write (6.8) as\nu2 = g + Ku2\n\n(6.11)\n\nwith a compact operator K. Therefore, on a subspace of finite codimension, (6.11) can be rewritten as\nu2 = g + K\u2032 g\nwith a compact operator K\u2032 which, again, remains compact after multiplication by Q, Q. As a result, for \u01eb fixed, we can find a subspace of\nfinite codimension in G \u2032 \u2229 Dom (P\u2212 ) such that\nk(P\u2212 \u2212 \u03bc)u2k\nku2 k\n\u2208 (1 \u2212 \u01eb, 1 + \u01eb),\n\u2208 (1 \u2212 \u01eb, 1 + \u01eb).\nkgk\nk(P\u2212 \u2212 \u03bc)gk\nTherefore the inequalities of the form (6.9), (6.10) can be written for\nu2 as well, just with a slight worsening of constants, the value of which\nis not important:\nk(P\u2212 \u2212 \u03bc)u2 k2 \u2212 \u03c4 2 ku2 k2 \u2265 c4 ku2 k2 ,\nas well as\nk(P\u2212 \u2212 \u03bc)u2 k2 \u2212 \u03c4 2 ku2 k2 \u2265 c5 k(P\u2212 \u2212 \u03bc)u2 k2 .\n\n(6.12)\n\nNow we can consider the complete second term in (6.5). This expression can be written as\nk(P\u2212 + V \u2212 \u03bc)u2 k2 \u2212 \u03c4 2 ku2k2 = k(P\u2212 \u2212 \u03bc)u2k2 \u2212 \u03c4 2 ku2 k2\n\n(6.13)\n\n+kVu2 k2 + 2R((P\u2212 \u2212 \u03bc)u2 , Vu2), u2 \u2208 \u011c.\nThe form kVu2 k2 is compact with respect to k(P\u2212 \u2212 \u03bc)u2 k2 , therefore\non a subspace of finite codimension we have kVu2k2 < c45 k(P\u2212 \u2212\u03bc)u2 k2 .\nFurther on, by Cauchy inequality,\n|2R((P\u2212 \u2212 \u03bc)u2 , Vu2)| \u2264\n\n4\nc5\nk(P\u2212 \u2212 \u03bc)u2 k2 + kVu2k2 .\n4\nc5\n\n(6.14)\n\nAgain, using the same relative compactness, we can restrict ourselves\nto a subspace of finite codimension so that the last term in (6.14) is no\n\n\f30\n\nROZENBLUM AND TASHCHIYAN\n\ngreater than c45 k(P\u2212 \u2212 \u03bc)u2k2 . After substituting these estimates into\n(6.13) and recalling (6.12), we obtain\n3c5\nk(P\u2212 + V \u2212 \u03bc)u2 k2 \u2212 \u03c4 2 ku2 k2 \u2265\nk(P\u2212 \u2212 \u03bc)u2 k2 \u2265 c6 ku2k2 (6.15)\n4\non a subspace L 2 of finite codimension in G \u2032 \u2229 Dom (P\u2212 ). Note that\nthe subspaces here do not depend on the value of \u03bb.\nThe third term. We are going to show now that the third term in\n(6.5) is majorized by the sum of two first ones. We can write it in the\nform\n2R((P\u2212 +V\u2212\u03bc)u1, (P\u2212 +V\u2212\u03bc)u2) = 2R((P\u2212 +V\u2212\u03bc)2 u1 , u2 ). (6.16)\nThe function u1 \u2208 Gq can be written as u1 = Qq v1 for some v1 \u2208 H0 .\nSo we have\n(P\u2212 + V \u2212 \u03bc)2 u1 = (QQ \u2212 \u03bc)2 Qq v1 + (P\u2212 \u2212 \u03bc)Vu1 +\n\n(6.17)\n\nV(P\u2212 \u2212 \u03bc)u1 + V 2 u1 = (QQ \u2212 \u03bc)2 Qq v1 + G.\nWe start with the first term in (6.17).\nIn the expression QQQq v1 we perform our usual commuting procedure moving Q to the right all the time. As soon as Q reaches the\nutmost right position, the corresponding term vanishes. Thus we arrive\nat the representation\nX\nQQQq v = 2\nQj (B\u25e6 + b)Qq\u2212j v1\n(6.18)\n\u25e6\n\nq\n\n= 2qB Q v1 +\n\nq\nX\n\nQj bQq\u2212j v = \u039bu1 + F1 .\n\nj=1\n\nIn a similar way, we transform the expression QQQQu1 = QQQQQq v1 :\nwe move both copies of the operator Q to the utmost right position,\nwhere they vanish, being applied to v1 \u2208 H0 . What is left has the form\nQQQQQq v1 = \u039b2 u1 + F2 .\n\n(6.19)\n\nThe functions F1 , F2 in (6.18), (6.19) are compositions of several, no\nmore than q, operators Q and at least one function with compact support, applied to v1 . The term G = ((P\u2212 \u2212 \u03bc)V + V(P\u2212 \u2212 \u03bc) + V2 )Qq v1\nin (6.17) involves the differential operator of order q + 2 with bounded\ncompactly supported coefficients, applied to v1 . So we have\n(P\u2212 + V \u2212 \u03bc)2 u1 = (\u039b \u2212 \u03bc)2 u1 \u2212 2\u03bcF1 + F2 + G.\nWe substitute this expression into (6.16) and use the fact that u1 and\nu2 are orthogonal. This leads us to\n2|R((P\u2212 + V \u2212 \u03bc)2 u1 , u2 )| = 2|R((\u22122\u03bcF1 + F2 + G), u2 )|\n\u2264 Mk \u2212 2\u03bcF1 + F2 + Gk2 + M \u22121 ku2k2 ,\nwhere M > 0 can be chosen arbitrarily. We fix M larger than 16c\u22121\n5 ,\nwhere c5 is the constant in (6.15). After this, we take \u01eb smaller than\n\n\fPERTURBED LANDAU HAMILTONIAN\n\n31\n\nc5\n.\n16M\n\nBy Proposition 5.2 we can choose the subspace M 1 \u2282 H0 , constructed when considering the first term in (6.4), in such way that\nthe codimension of M 1 in H0 is no greater than (1 + \u01eb)\u039e(\u03ba\u03bb) for\nsome \u03ba and that k \u2212 2\u03bcF1 + F2 + Gk2 is no greater than c21 \u03bbkv1 k2 .\nWith all parameters chosen in this way, for u1 \u2208 L 1 = Qq M 1 and\nu2 \u2208 L 2 the third term in (6.5) is majorated by the sum of the first\ntwo terms, and thus the whole expression in (6.5) is non-negative for\nu = u1 + u2 \u2208 L 1 \u2295 L 2 . The subspace L = L 1 \u2295 L 2 has codimension no greater than (1 + \u01eb)\u039e(\u03ba\u03bb) + N(\u01eb). As a result, due to \u01eb being\narbitrary and to the fact that \u039e(\u03ba\u03bb) \u2261 \u039e(\u03bb), \u03bb \u2192 0, we have\nlim sup N\u2212 (\u03bb; q, b, V)\u039e(\u03bb)\u22121 = lim sup N\u2212 (\u03bb; q, b, V)\u039e(\u03ba\u03bb)\u22121 \u2264 (1+\u01eb)\n\u03bb\u21920\n\n\u03bb\u21920\n\nFinally, we let \u01eb \u2192 0, and obtain (6.3).\n\n\u0003\n\n6.2. Lower estimate. Now we establish an estimate for N\u00b1 (\u03bb) from\nbelow. The conditions for this estimate to hold are expressed in the\nterms of an effective potential constructed for each LL from the magnetic field b and the electric potential V . The complicated form of this\neffective potential reflects the complicated character of the influence of\nthe magnetic perturbation onto the behavior of eigenvalues: we remind\nagain that the latter dependence is not monotone. Our construction\nrequires considerable smoothness of b and V ; in order to avoid extra\ntechnicalities, we suppose here that both are infinitely smooth.\nFor a fixed LL \u039b = \u039bq , with the same s\u00b1 , \u03bc\u00b1 , \u03c4 as before, we define\nthe effective potentials as\nW\u00b1 = W\u00b1 [b, V, \u03bb] = \u2212(\u039b \u00b1 \u03bb+2B\u25e6)(s + 2B\u25e6 )Zq [b] \u2212 Zq+2 [b]\n\n(6.20)\n\n\u25e6\n\n+2(\u03bc\u00b1 + 3B )Zq+1 [b] \u2212 Xq [b, 4(2B \u2212 b + \u03bc\u00b1 )b \u2212 (4B \u2212 2\u03bc\u00b1 + V )V ]\n\u22122Xq+1 [b, V \u2212 3b] \u2212 4IYq [b, \u2202V \u2212 2\u2202b],\nwhere the expressions Z, X , Y are described in Proposition 3.4.\nTheorem 6.3. Suppose that for \u03bb close to zero the potential W\u00b1 is nonnegative and, moreover, there exists an open set \u03a9 where W\u00b1 \u2265 c > 0\nfor c independent on \u03bb. Then\nlim inf N\u00b1 (\u03bb, q, b, V )\u039e(\u03bb)\u22121 \u2265 1\n\u03bb\u21920\n\n(6.21)\n\nProof. We consider the eigenvalues below \u039b and prove the estimate\n(6.21) with 'minus' sign. The other case is proved in an almost identical\nway.\nWe are going to construct the subspace L in G = Gq , having dimension asymptotically greater than (1 \u2212 \u01eb)\u039e(\u03bb) such that the inequality\nk(P\u2212 + V \u2212 \u03bc)uk2 < \u03c4 2 kuk2\n\n(6.22)\n\nis satisfied for all u \u2208 L \\ {0}. To do this, we set u = Qq v, v \u2208 H0 ,\nand thus reduce both parts of (6.22) to quadratic forms on the lowest\nLandau level using Proposition 3.4 and then apply Proposition 5.3.\n\n\f32\n\nROZENBLUM AND TASHCHIYAN\n\nSo, we have\nk(P\u2212 + V \u2212 \u03bc)uk2 \u2212 \u03c4 2 kuk2 = (P\u2212 u, P\u2212 u) + 2R(V u, P\u2212 u)+ (6.23)\n(\u03bc2 \u2212 \u03c4 2 )kuk2 + (V u, V u) \u2212 2\u03bc(V u, u) \u2212 2\u03bc(P\u2212 u, u).\nWe substitute u = Qq v, v \u2208 H0 into (6.23) and consider each term.\nFirst, by (3.5), we have\n(\u03bc2 \u2212 \u03c4 2 )kuk2 = (\u03bc2 \u2212 \u03c4 2 )Cq kvk2 + (\u03bc2 \u2212 \u03c4 2 )(Zq [b]v, v).\n\n(6.24)\n\nBy (3.6) applied for U = V and then for U = V 2 , we obtain\n\u22122\u03bc(V u, u) = \u22122\u03bc(Xq [b, V ]v, v); (V u, V u) = (Xq [b, V 2 ]v, v). (6.25)\nFor the last term in (6.23), we have\n\u22122\u03bc(P\u2212 u, u) = \u22122\u03bc(QQu, u) = \u22122\u03bc(QQu, u) + 4\u03bcB\u25e6 (u, u) (6.26)\n+4\u03bc(bu, u) = \u22122\u03bcCq+1 kvk2\n\u22122\u03bc(Zq+1 [b]v, v) + 4\u03bcB\u25e6Cq kvk2 + 4\u03bcB\u25e6 (Zq [b]v, v) + 4\u03bc(Xq [b, b]v, v).\nFurther on, commuting Q, Q, we get\n2R(V u, P\u2212 u) = 2R(V u, QQu) = 2R(QV u, Qu) \u2212 4(BV u, u) (6.27)\n= 2(V Qu, Qu) + 2R([Q, V ]u, Qu) \u2212 4(BV u, u).\nTo the first and the third terms in (6.27), we apply (3.6), and to the\nsecond term we apply (3.7) (with U = \u22122i\u2202V = [Q, V ]), obtaining\n2R(V u, P\u2212 u)\n\n(6.28)\n\n= 2(Xq+1 [b, V ]v, v) \u2212 4(Xq [b, BV ]v, v) + 4I(Yq [b, \u2202V ]v, v).\nFinally, for the term (P\u2212 u, P\u2212 u) we have\nkP\u2212 uk2 = ((QQ \u2212 2B)u, (QQ \u2212 2B)u) = (P\u2212 Qu, Qu)\n\n(6.29)\n\n+4B\u25e62 (u, u) + 4((2B\u25e6 + b)bu, u) \u2212 4B\u25e6 kQuk2 \u2212 4R(Qbu, Qu).\nAll these terms are of the form already considered in (6.26), (6.27),(6.28).\nThus we obtain\n(P\u2212 u, P\u2212 u) = Cq+2 kvk2 + (Zq+2 [b]v, v) \u2212 2B\u25e6 Cq+1 kvk2\n\u25e6\n\n\u25e62\n\n(6.30)\n\n2\n\n\u22122B (Zq+1 [b]v, v) \u2212 2(Xq+1 [b, b]v, v) + 4B (Cq kvk + (Zq [b]v, v))\n\u22124B\u25e6 (Cq+1 kvk2 + (Zq+1 [b]v, v)) + 4(Xq [b, (2B\u25e6 + b)b]v, v)\n\u22124(Xq+1 [b, b]v, v) \u2212 8I(Yq [b, \u2202b]v, v).\n\n\fPERTURBED LANDAU HAMILTONIAN\n\n33\n\nNow we collect the expressions (6.24), (6.25), (6.26), (6.28) (6.30) to\nget\nk(P\u2212 + V \u2212\u03bc)uk2 \u2212\u03c4 2 kuk2 = (\u03bc2 \u2212 \u03c4 2 )(Cq kvk2 + (Zq [b]v, v))\n\n(6.31)\n\n\u22122\u03bc(Xq [b, V ]v, v) + (Xq [b, V 2 ]v, v) \u2212 2\u03bcCq+1 kvk2 \u2212 2\u03bc(Zq+1 [b]v, v)\n+4\u03bcB\u25e6Cq kvk2 + 4\u03bcB\u25e6 (Zq [b]v, v) + 4\u03bc(Xq [b, b]v, v) + 2(Xq+1 [b, V ]v, v)\n\u22124(Xq [b, bV ]v, v) + 4I(Yq [b, \u2202V ]v, v) + Cq+2 kvk2 + (Zq+2 [b]v, v)\n\u22122B\u25e6 Cq+1 kvk2 \u2212 2B\u25e6 (Zq+1 [b]v, v) \u2212 2(Xq+1 [b, b]v, v) + 4B\u25e62 Cq kvk2\n+4B\u25e62 (Zq [b]v, v) \u2212 4B\u25e6 Cq+1 kvk2 \u2212 4B\u25e6 (Zq+1 [b]v, v)\n+4(Xq [b, (2B\u25e6 + b)b]v, v) \u2212 4(Xq+1 [b, B]v, v) \u2212 8I(Yq [b, \u2202b]v, v).\nThe terms with kvk2 have the coefficient\n(\u03bc2 \u2212 \u03c4 2 )Cq \u2212 2\u03bcCq+1 + 4\u03bcB\u25e6Cq + Cq+2 \u2212 2B\u25e6 Cq+1 + 4B\u25e62 Cq\n\u22124B\u25e6 Cq+1 = ((\u03bc2 \u2212 \u03c4 2 ) \u2212 2\u03bc\u039b + \u039b2 )Cq = \u03bb(\u039b \u2212 s)Cq .\nThe sum of all remaining terms in (6.31) equals exactly (\u2212W\u2212 v, v),\nwhere W\u2212 is given by (6.20). Now, by Proposition 5.4 it is possible to\nfind a subspace M(\u03bb) \u2282 H0 such that (W v, v) > \u03bb(L \u2212 s)Cq kvk2 for\nv \u2208 H0 and dimension of M(\u03bb) is greater than \u039e(\u03bb(L\u2212s)Cq )(1\u2212o(\u03bb)).\nThis is the subspace we need.\n\u0003\nIf the conditions of Theorem 6.3 are satisfied then the conditions\nof Theorem 6.2 are satisfied as well and we arrive at the asymptotic\nformula\nlim N\u00b1 (\u03bb, q, b, V )\u039e(\u03bb)\u22121 = 1\n(6.32)\n\u03bb\u21920\n\n7. Proofs of technical lemmas\nProof of Lemma 3.2. As usual, we may prove the inequality for functions u in the Schwartz space first, and then extend it to all functions\nfor which the right-hand side of (3.2) is finite, by continuity.\nWe will prove Lemma by a double induction. For N = 1 the statement is obvious: ||Qu||2 = (P\u2212 u, u), ||Qu||2 = (P+ u, u) = (P\u2212 u, u) +\n2(Bu, u). Now, suppose that for some N0 we have established (3.2) for\nall N < N0 and for all combinations of Tj . The (exterior) induction\nstep will consist of proving (3.2) for N = N0 .\nTo do this, we are going to show first that one can replace P\u2212 by\nP+ on the right-hand side of (3.2) for all N < N0 . This will follow as\nsoon as we prove the inequality\nN\n\u2032\n(PN\n\u2212 u, u) \u2264 C(P+ u, u) + C (u, u), N \u2264 N0\n\n(7.1)\n\n(note that the case N = N0 is included here.) This fact we again prove\nby induction (interior) in N. The statement is obvious for N = 1.\n\n\f34\n\nROZENBLUM AND TASHCHIYAN\n\nSuppose that we have proved it for all N < N1 \u2264 N0 and we will check\nit for N = N1 . In fact, by (2.10),\nN1\n1\nPN\n\u2212 = P+ + R,\n\n(7.2)\n\nwhere R is a sum of many terms R\u03ba . Each R\u03ba is the product of less\nthen N1 factors P\u2212 and some factors 2B. In other words, this means\nthat R\u03ba is a product of no more than N1 \u22121 operators Q, no more than\nN1 \u2212 1 operators Q and several functions, with all derivatives bounded.\nNow we transform each term R\u03ba in the following way. We move half of\nthe factors Q, Q in R\u03ba to the left and the other half of these operators\nto the right, commuting them with functions and using the relations\n(3.8).\nSo, many terms will be produced, having the form\nT1 . . . Tk F Tk+1 . . . Tk+m ,\n\n(7.3)\n\nwhere k, m < N1 , each Tj is Q or Q and F is a bounded function. Now\nwe can estimate each term in (7.3):\n|(T1 . . . Tk F Tk+1 . . . Tk+m u, u)| = |(F Tk+1 . . . Tk+m u, Tk\u2217 . . . T1\u2217 u)| (7.4)\n\u2264 CkF Tk+1 . . . Tk+m uk kTk\u2217 . . . T1\u2217 uk.\nThe right-hand side in (7.4) can be estimated by the interior and the\nexterior inductive assumptions, since there are less than N1 and less\nthan N0 factors Tj involved. Summing all these estimates over all terms\ngenerated by R, we arrive at\n1 \u22121\n(Ru, u) \u2264 C(PN\nu, u) + C \u2032 (u, u),\n+\n\nwhich, together with (7.2) leads to (7.1) for N = N1 . Changing places\nof P+ and P\u2212 , we obtain the dual inequality\nN\n\u2032\n(PN\n+ u, u) \u2264 C(P\u2212 u, u) + C (u, u), N \u2264 N0 .\n\n(7.5)\n\nNow, the inductive step in the exterior induction goes rather easily.\nFor N = N0 , let us have N operators T1 , . . . , TN . Suppose that TN = Q.\nThen we can write ||T1 . . . TN u||2 as ||T1 . . . TN \u22121 v||2 with v = Qu.\nBy the inductive assumption and (7.1), we have ||T1 . . . TN \u22121 v||2 \u2264\nN \u22121\nC(P+\nv, v) + C \u2032 (v, v), the first term here equals C(PN\n\u2212 u, u) so we\narrive at (3.2). In the case of TN = Q, we write the left-hand side\nin (3.2) as ||T1 . . . TN \u22121 v||2 with v = Qu. By the inductive assumpN \u22121\ntion, this quantity is majorized by (P\u2212\nv, v) + (v, v) which equals\nN\n(P+ u, u) + (P+ u, u). Applying (7.5), we again obtain the estimate\n(3.2).\n\u0003\nProof of Lemma 4.2. If A satisfies the conditions of the Lemma and\nwe commute some entry of the resolvent with a neighboring function\nor the operators Q or Q then all resulting operators will again satisfy\nthese conditions. So we perform such commutings by the following\nrule. First, move one copy of the resolvent to the utmost right position.\n\n\fPERTURBED LANDAU HAMILTONIAN\n\n35\n\nThen if there are three or more operators Q, Q in a row in front of some\nresolvent, commute the utmost right of these operator with resolvent.\nAfter performing this operation as long as it is needed, we arrive at the\nsituation where in each summand no more than two operators Q, Q\nstand in front of each copy of the resolvent. Each such group is a\nbounded operator, by Lemma 3.2. At least one copy of the resolvent\nhas no more than one operator Q, Q in front of it, because the order of\nthe whole product is negative. After this, we move the function h that\nhas compact support to the position in front of this particular copy of\nthe resolvent. In this process, the structure of all products remains the\nsame, moreover, when we commute h with resolvent, a compact term\narises. Finally, we arrive at the term hT R\u00b1 or hR\u00b1 , where T is Q or Q.\nThis operator is, obviously, compact. All other factors in the product\nare bounded, therefore the whole product is compact.\n\u0003\nProof of Lemma 4.3. Boundedness of the operator in question is derived from Lemma 3.2 in the same way as Proposition 3.3 is proved.\nBy means of commuting, preserving the overall structure of all arising\nterms, we arrive at a sum of operators of the form\nh\u0303\u03ba T\u03ba Pq T\u03bah\u0303\u03ba =\n\n(7.6)\n\n[h\u0303\u03ba T\u03ba (P\u2212 + 1)\u2212N ][(P\u2212 + 1)N Pq (P\u2212 + 1)N ][(P\u2212 + 1)\u2212N T\u03bah\u0303\u03ba ],\nwhere T\u03ba , T\u03ba are products of no more than N operators Q, Q. The\nmiddle term in (7.6) is bounded by Proposition 3.1, and the extreme\nterms are bounded by Lemma 3.2. If, say, the function h\u0303\u03ba is compactly\nsupported, we can take N larger than the number of terms in T\u03ba , and\nthen the operator h\u0303\u03ba T\u03ba (P\u2212 + 1)\u2212N has negative order and is compact\nby Lemma 4.2.\n\u0003\nReferences\n[1] Bargmann, V.
