Despite the close similarity between these two accelerating epochs\nthere is a number of differences. For instance, inflationary era is characterized by large value of curvature while dark\nera occurs at small curvature. Moreover, the effective equation of state parameter w is qualitatively different for\ninflation or late-time cosmic acceleration. Inflation occurs right after Big Bang/Big Crunch singularity while number\nof quintessence/phantom dark energy models end up at finite time future singularity. This suggests the very natural\nconjecture: Big Bang should be identified with finite time singularity. In other words, the universe realizes cyclic\nevolution which may be produced by multi-fluid [1] or by the theory with oscillating equation of state parameter [2].\nIt is natural to construct the cyclic universe within the theory which describes the inflation and dark energy in unified\nway.\nModified gravity is realistic alternative for unified description of inflation with dark energy (for review of such\nunification in modified gravity, see [3]). Moreover, its weak-field limit may lead to newtonian regime (for review,\nsee [4]). Hence, modified gravity represents very natural candidate where cyclic cosmology may be realized. The\npurpose of this work is precisely this one: reconstruction of modified F (R) gravity which leads to cyclic evolution.\nIn the next section the reconstruction technique for scalar-tensor theory and F (R) gravity is developed. We find the\nexplicit examples of scalar-tensor theory and F (R) gravity which have the solutions corresponding to cyclic universe.\nIn third section F (R) action is presented as General Relativity plus ideal fluid. The reconstruction is developed for\nsuch formulation of modified gravity. Again, the example of F (R) gravity which admits cyclic universe solution is\nfound. In fourth section using above methods we show that ekpyrotic scenario may be also realized in frames of\nmodified gravity. In fifth section we reconstruct F (R) gravity which induces little rip cosmology. Such non-singular\ndark energy model was recently proposed in Ref. [5] as an alternative to \u039bCDM model. Furthermore, we demonstrate\nthat reconstruction of F (R) theory which leads to non-singular phantom evolution is possible. Some summary is given\nin the last section.\nII.\n\nCONFORMALLY CYCLIC UNIVERSE\n\nLet us show how to construct the cyclic universe solution in modified gravity. The starting point is the spatially\nflat FRW metric\nX\n\u00012\n(1)\ndxi .\nds2 = \u2212dt2 + a(t)2\ni=1,2,3\n\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\u2021\n\u00a7\n\nnojiri@phys.nagoya-u.ac.jp\nodintsov@ieec.uab.es\nAlso at Tomsk State Pedagogical University.\nsaez@ieec.uab.es\n\n\f2\nwhere a(t) is the monotonically expanding function of the cosmological time t. Let a(t) has the following form\n(2)\n\nln a(t) = H0 t + h(t) .\nHere H0 is a positive constant and h(t) is a function with period T :\n\n(3)\n\nh(t + T ) = h(t) .\nThen\nds2 = \u2212dt2 + a(t + T )2\n\ndxi\n\ni=1,2,3\n\n2\n\n2 2H0 T\n\n2\n\n2\n\n= \u2212dt + a(t) e\n= \u2212dt + a(t)\n\nX\n\nX\n\n\u00012\n\ndxi\n\ni=1,2,3\n\nX\n\ndx\u0303i\n\ni=1,2,3\n\n\u00012\n\n.\n\n\u00012\n\n(4)\n\nHere x\u0303i \u2261 eH0 T xi . Eqs. (1) and (4) show that the metric at t is physically identical with that at t + T . In this\nsense, the universe is cyclic although the universe is monotonically expanding. Hence, it called as conformally cyclic\nuniverse. A simplest example is\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2\u03c0t\n.\n(5)\nh(t) = H1 cos\nT\nHere H1 is a positive constant less than H0 , which guarantees that the universe is monotonically expanding.\nWe now consider the models which reproduce the scale factor a(t) given by (2) with (5). First, let us investigate\nthe scalar-tensor model, whose action is given by\n\u001a\n\u001b\nZ\n1\n1\n4 \u221a\n\u03bc\nS = d x \u2212g\n(6)\nR \u2212 \u03c9(\u03c6)\u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u2202 \u03c6 \u2212 V (\u03c6) + Lmatter .\n2\u03ba2\n2\nHere, \u03c9(\u03c6) and V (\u03c6) are functions of the scalar \u03c6. For the model where \u03c9(\u03c6) and V (\u03c6) are given by a single function\nf (\u03c6), as follows,\n\u03c9(\u03c6) = \u2212\n\n2 \u2032\u2032\nf (\u03c6) ,\n\u03ba2\n\nV (\u03c6) =\n\n\u0001\n1\n3f \u2032 (\u03c6)2 + f \u2032\u2032 (\u03c6) ,\n2\n\u03ba\n\n(7)\n\nthe exact solution of the FRW equations has the following form:\n\u03c6 = t,\n\nH = f \u2032 (t) .\n\n(8)\n\nIn case of (2) with (5), one finds\nf (t) = ln a(t) ,\n\n2\u03c0H1\nsin\nf (t) = H0 \u2212\nT\n\u2032\n\n\u0012\n\n2\u03c0t\nT\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(9)\n\nTherefore if we consider the model\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u00132\n\u0012\n2H1 2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\u03c6\n\u03c9(\u03c6) =\n,\ncos\n\u03ba2\nT\nT\n( \u0012\n\u0013\u00132 \u0012 \u00132\n\u0013)\n\u0012\n\u0012\n2\u03c0H1\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\u03c6\n2\u03c0\u03c6\n1\n,\n\u2212\ncos\nsin\nV (\u03c6) = 2 3 H0 \u2212\n\u03ba\nT\nT\nT\nT\nthe conformal cyclic universe (2) with (5) can be reproduced.\nWe now consider F (R) theory\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\nF (R)\n4 \u221a\nSF (R) = d x \u2212g\n+ Lmatter .\n2\u03ba2\n\n(10)\n\n(11)\n\n\f3\nHere F (R) is an appropriate function of the scalar curvature R.

By the variation over \u03c6, it follows that 0 = P \u2032 (\u03c6)R+Q\u2032 (\u03c6),\nwhich may be solved with respect to \u03c6 as \u03c6 = \u03c6(R). By substituting the obtained expression of \u03c6(R) into (12), one\narrives again at the F (R) gravity action (for reconstruction of modified gravities, see Refs.

Furthermore by writing P (\u03c6) as\nP (\u03c6) = U (\u03c6)\u22124 ,\n\n(20)\n\n(19) is rewritten as follows:\n12\n2 dU (\u03c6)\n\u2212\ng (\u03c6) =\nU (\u03c6) d\u03c6\nU (\u03c6)2\n\u2032\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c6\n\n\u0012\n\ndU (\u03c6)\nd\u03c6\n\n\u00132\n\n.\n\n(21)\n\n\f4\nAs an example, we may consider\nU (\u03c6) = U1 + U2 cos \u03c9\u03c6 .\nHere U1 , U2 , and \u03c9 are constants and it is assumed U1 > U2 > 0, which show U (\u03c6) does not vanish. Hence\n\u0001\n3U22 \u03c9 2 2\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c91 sin (2\u03c9\u03c6) + C\n2U2 \u03c9 sin \u03c9\u03c6\n\u2032\n\u2212\ng (\u03c6) = \u2212\n.\n2\nU1 + U2 cos \u03c9\u03c6\n(U1 + U2 cos \u03c9\u03c6)\n\n(22)\n\n(23)\n\nHere C is a constant of the integration. Note that the obtained g \u2032 (\u03c6) is not always positive. We also note that the\ng \u2032 (\u03c6) is not periodic due to the term proportional to \u03c6. This kind of term always appears for the periodic U (\u03c6) since\nthe integrand of the last term in (21) is positive definite and therefore the integration cannot be periodic.\nLet us now consider an example where the function P (\u03c6) is given by,\nP (\u03c6) = U (\u03c6)\u22124 = P0 (cos \u03c9\u03c6)4 ,\n\n(24)\n\nwhere P0 and \u03c9 are constants. Then, by the equation (18), the solution is,\ng \u2032 (\u03c6) = g0 (cos \u03c9\u03c6)2 + 2\u03c9(sin 2\u03c9\u03c6 \u2212 tan \u03c9\u03c6) ,\n\n(25)\n\nwhere g0 is an integration constant. Note that here the solution contains divergences due to the term of the tangent\nin (24). These divergences correspond to points where the scale factor becomes null a(t0 ) = 0, which can be identified\nwith a Big Bang/Crunch singularity. This class of singularities is very common in cyclic Universes, where the ekpyrotic\nscenario is reproduced. In the same way other cyclic universes may be used for explicit reconstruction of modified\ngravity.\nIII.\n\nRECONSTRUCTED F (R) AS AN EFFECTIVE PERFECT FLUID\n\nLet us start with the modified gravity FRW equations written in the following form:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\n\u2032\n2\nF (R) + 3H\u2202t F (R) \u2212 3\u1e22 ,\n3H = \u2032\nF (R) 2\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\n\u2032\n2 \u2032\n2\nF (R) + 2H\u2202t F (R) + \u2202t F (R) \u2212 \u1e22 ,\n\u22123H \u2212 2\u1e22 = \u2212 \u2032\nF (R) 2\n\n(26)\n\nwhere we have neglected the contributions of any other kind of matter. If we compare Eqs. (26) with the standard FRW\nequations (3H 2 = \u03ba2 \u03c1 and \u22123H 2 \u2212 2\u1e22 = \u03ba2 p), we may identify both right sides of Eqs. (26) with the energy-density\nand pressure of a perfect fluid, in such a way that they are:\n\u0012\n\u0014\n\u0013\n\u0015\n1\n1\n1\n\u2032\n\u03c1 = 2\nF\n(R)\n+\n3H\u2202\nF\n(R)\n\u2212\n3\n\u1e22\nt\n\u03ba F \u2032 (R) 2\n\u0012\n\u0014\n\u0013\n\u0015\n1\n1\n1\n\u2032\n2 \u2032\nF\n(R)\n+\n2H\u2202\nF\n(R)\n+\n\u2202\nF\n(R)\n+\n\u1e22\n.\n(27)\np = \u2212 2\nt\nt\n\u03ba F \u2032 (R) 2\nThen, Eqs. (26) take the form of the usual FRW equations, where the EoS parameter for this dark fluid is defined by:\n\u0001\n1\n1\n\u2032\n2 \u2032\np\nF \u2032 (R) 2 F (R) + 2H\u2202t F (R) + \u2202t F (R) + \u1e22\nw= =\u2212\n\u0001\n.\n(28)\n1\n1\n\u2032\n\u03c1\nF \u2032 (R) 2 F (R) + 3H\u2202t F (R) \u2212 3\u1e22\nThe corresponding EoS may be written as follows:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\nH\n1\n2 \u2032\n\u2032\n\u2202 F (R) \u2212 \u2032\n\u2202t F (R) .\np = \u2212\u03c1 \u2212 2 4\u1e22 + \u2032\n\u03ba\nF (R) t\nF (R)\n\n(29)\n\nThe Ricci scalar is R = 6(2H 2 + \u1e22), then F (R) is a function of the Hubble parameter H and its derivative \u1e22. The\nform of the EoS is written as: p = \u2212\u03c1 + g(H, \u1e22, \u1e26, * * * ), where\n\u0011\n1 \u0010\n(30)\ng(H, \u1e22, \u1e26, * * * ) = \u2212 2 4\u1e22 + \u2202t2 (ln F \u2032 (R)) + (\u2202t ln F \u2032 (R))2 \u2212 H\u2202t ln F \u2032 (R) .\n\u03ba\n\n\f5\nThen, by combining the FRW equations, it yields the following differential equation:\n\u1e22 +\n\n\u03ba2\ng(H, \u1e22, \u1e26, * * * ) = 0 .\n2\n\n(31)\n\nHence, for a given cosmological model, the function g given in (30) may be seen as a function of cosmic time t, and\nthen by the time-dependence of the Ricci scalar, the function g is rewritten in terms of R. Finally, the function F (R)\nis recovered by the expression (30). In this sense, Eq. (31) combining with the expression (30) results in [8]:\ndx(t)\n+ x(t)2 \u2212 H(t)x(t) = 2\u1e22(t) ,\ndt\n\n(32)\n\nd(ln F \u2032 (R(t))\nwhere x(t) =\n. In general, this equation is very difficult to be solved for a particular Hubble parameter,\ndt\nso that the reconstruction of F (R) gravity is not so simple. Let us consider an example to illustrate this method, we\nassume a power-law evolution for the Hubble parameter,\n\nH(t) =\n\n\u03b1\n.\nt\n\n(33)\n\nThen, the solution of the equation (33) is given by,\n\u22121 +\n\u03b1\nx(t) =\n\u2212\n2t\nRecalling that x(t) =\n\nd(ln F \u2032 (R(t))\n,\ndt\n\n\u0010\n\u221a\n1 \u2212 6\u03b1 + \u03b12 \u22121 +\n\n2C1\n\u221a\nt 1\u22126\u03b1+\u03b12 +C1\n\n2t\n\n\u0011\n\n.\n\n(34)\n\nthe F (R) action yields,\n\nF (R) = C1 R\n\n5+\u03b1\u2212\n\n\u221a\n\n1+\u03b1(\u03b1\u22126)\n4\n\n\u0012 \u221a\n\u0013\n1+\u03b1(\u03b1\u22126)\n2\nR\n+ C2 ,\n\n(35)\n\nwhere {C1 , C2 } are integration constants. Hence, the F (R) action has been reconstructed for the class of power-law\nsolutions expressed in (33). However, for a particular oscillating solution, as the ones studied in the section above,\nthe equation (32) turns out very complicated, and in general, one can not obtain an explicit expression for the action.\nNevertheless, let us proceed in a different way, by reconstructing the Hubble parameter assuming a particular x(t) in\nthe equation (32),\nx(t) =\n\nd(ln F \u2032 (R(t))\n= H1 cos \u03c9t .\ndt\n\nThen, by the equation (32), the Hubble parameter obtained is given by,\nZ\n\u0001\nH1 sin \u03c9t\nH1 sin \u03c9t\nH1 sin \u03c9t\ndt e 2\u03c9\nH12 + H12 cos \u03c9t \u2212 2H1 \u03c9 sin \u03c9t .\nH(t) = C1 e\u2212 2\u03c9 + e\u2212 2\u03c9\n\n(36)\n\n(37)\n\nAnd the action is obtained,\n\nF (R) =\n\nZ\n\ndR e\u2212\n\nH1\n\u03c9\n\nsin[\u03c9t(R)]\n\n.\n\n(38)\n\nHere the function t(R) comes from the inversion of the definition of the Ricci scalar R(t) = 6(2H 2 + \u1e22). Hence, this\nkind of cyclic evolution (37) can be reproduced in the frame of F (R) gravities. However, the complexity of the integral\ndoes not allow us to get an explicit expression for the F (R) action. Note that for explicit values of the constant H1 ,\nand of the frequency \u03c9, some information may be obtained for different times, since each term in the integral (37)\nbecomes important for different values of the time coordinate, i.e. at different epochs of the Universe evolution.\nIV.\n\nTHE EKPYROTIC SCENARIO IN F (R) GRAVITY\n\nThe inflationary epoch (early-time acceleration) just after the initial singularity that was the origin of the Universe,\nis able to solve some of intrinsic problems of the Big Bang model. These problems, known as the flatness problem, the\nquestion on the homogeneity at large scales, the absence of monopoles or the origin of the inhomogeneities that lead\n\n\f6\nto the formation of large scale structure, can be solved quite well by the inflationary paradigm. However, a decade\nago a new proposal, alternative to inflation, was suggested, the so-called Ekpyrotic/cyclic Universe (see Ref. [9]). This\nnew scenario solves additionally the puzzles of the standard cosmological model as well as it provides perhaps a more\ncomplete picture of the Universe evolution. While in the inflationary scenario, the initial conditions are required to\ncomplete the cosmological picture, as the time begins at the Big Bang singularity, in the ekpyrotic Universe, this is\nnot a requirement due to its cyclic nature. The evolution presented by this class of cyclic Universe contains in general\nfour stages per cycle: a first initial hot state similar to the standard Big Bang model, then a phase of accelerated\nexpansion, after which a phase where the Universe starts to contract occurs and finally ends in a Big Bang/Crunch\ntransition, when the cycle starts again. The corresponding period where the main problems enumerated above are\nsolved occurs during the contracting phase. In the usual ekpyrotic models, a scalar field is included to reproduce a\ncyclic Universe. However, it is clear that modified gravity, and precisely F (R) gravity, can perfectly reproduce the\nekpyrotic scenario. In order to show that the above models, reproduced by F (R) gravity, can solve the initial problems\nby means of a cyclic Universe containing a contracting phase, let us consider a FRW Universe described by,\n\u03c1m0\n\u03c1r0\n\u03c1\u03c30\nk\n3 2\nH = 3 + 4 + 6 \u2212 2 + \u03c1F (R) .\n(39)\n\u03ba2\na\na\na\na\nHere \u03c1m0 is the energy-density for pressureless matter, \u03c1r0 for radiation, \u03c1\u03c30 for the anisotropies, k is the spatial\ncurvature of the Universe and \u03c1F (R) is the effective energy-density defined in the previous section for the extra\ngeometrical terms. Then, in order to get a homogeneous and isotropic spatially flat Universe in a contracting phase,\nthe effective EoS parameter wF (R) > 1, so that when the scale factor tends to zero, the F (R) terms in the equations\ndominate over the rest, and the result is the same as in the inflationary scenario.\nLooking at the above examples, we have that for the model given in (25), the effective EoS parameter for the perfect\nfluid defined with the extra terms of F (R) is given by,\n\u0001\npF (R)\n4\u03c9 \u22122\u03c9(cos \u03c9t) + \u03c9(sec \u03c9t)2 + H0 (cos \u03c9t)(sin \u03c9t)\nwF (R) =\n.\n(40)\n= \u22121 +\n2\n\u03c1F (R)\n3 (H0 (cos \u03c9t)2 + 2\u03c9(sin 2\u03c9t) \u2212 (tan \u03c9t))\n\nHence, for each epoch of the Universe, the effective EoS behaves in\neach cycle as follows\n\uf8f1\n8\u03c9\n32\u03c9 2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\u22121 + 3H0 + 3H02 ,\n\u2212 23 ,\nwF (R) =\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n4\u03c9 2\n\u22121 \u2212 4H\n2 ,\n0\n\na different way, we can summarize the phases of\nt \u2192 \u03c0/4\u03c9\nt \u2192 \u03c0/2\u03c9\nt \u2192 \u03c0/\u03c9\n\n(41)\n\nHence, we can see that the F (R) fluid dominates over the rest of components in (40) when its EoS is larger than\n1, which occurs for small times and a contracting universe, while for large times, the EoS behaves as dark energy,\nand even it crosses the phantom barrier when wF (R) < \u22121. So that the ekpyrotic scenario takes place, and the\nresult is the observable Universe. Hence, we have shown that cyclic Universe can be well reconstructed in frames of\nmodified gravity, and the initial problems, as the flatness or horizon problems, can be solved. However, generally\nthe cyclic Universes contain singularities of the type of Big Bang/Crunch, where the scale factor goes to zero, and\nthe energy densities for matter/radiation grow to infinity, as ,for example, occurs for the model (24). In the original\nekpyrotic model, based on a scalar field, the divergences are controlled by a function introduced in the action as a\nstrong coupling between the scalar field and the other components. In the kind of ekpyrotic scenario proposed here,\na smooth transition along the Big Bang/Crunch can be reproduced by means of the reconstruction of models that\navoid the singularity (as it is realized for several examples given above) or by introducing a coupling in the matter\naction,\nZ\n\u221a\nSM = dx4 \u2212g\u03b2(R)Lm .\n(42)\n\nHence, by an appropriate choice of the function \u03b2(R), the matter divergences can be avoided, and the transition\nacross the Big Bang/Crunch can be realized smoothly.\nTherefore, the ekpyrotic scenario can be realized with no need to introduce an additional field but only in terms of\nmodified gravity.\nV.\n\nLITTLE RIP COSMOLOGY IN MODIFIED GRAVITY\n\nIn the previous sections, several oscillating Universes have been reconstructed via F (R) gravity. Cyclic Universes\nseem to be well reproduced in these theories and the ekpyrotic scenario can be realized. Here we are interesting in the\n\n\f7\nstudy of cosmological models which are able to reproduce super-accelerated phase in the context of modified gravity.\nIn this case, the corresponding effective EoS parameter (28) crosses the phantom barrier, that is wF (R) < \u22121. It is\nwell-known that cosmological phantom models usually contain the so-called big rip singularity [10]. In the case of\nthe big rip singularity, the phantom energy-density and the scale factor diverges in a finite future. One of the most\nsurprising consequences of the big rip is the dissolution of bounded systems, as the Solar System and atoms before\nthe singularity (see Ref. [10, 11]).\nIn this section, we are interesting to reconstruct F (R) gravity which is able to reproduce a phantom behavior, being\nfree of future singularity. Nevertheless, such singularity free or little rip cosmology (see Refs. [5, 12]) also leads to\ndissolution of bound structures. Let us recall the first FRW equation in F (R),\n3 2\nH (t) = \u03c1F (R) (t) ,\n\u03ba2\n\n(43)\n\nwhere the energy-density is defined in (27). By definition, a big rip singularity occurs in a finite time, usually denoted\nby ts , when the scale factor a(t) and the energy-density diverges. So in order to avoid a big rip singularity, \u03c1F (R) (t)\nmust remain positive and finite for all t. Looking at the expression for \u03c1F (R) (t) in (27), it seems complicated to obtain\na general condition on the form of F (R), but a natural condition (not sufficient) seems F \u2032 (R) > 0 for all R in order\nto avoid divergences. On the other hand, in the absence of matter, the EoS parameter (28) can be rewritten as,\nwF (R) = \u22121 \u2212\n\n2\u1e22\n.\n3H 2\n\n(44)\n\nHence, for a super-accelerated expansion, the Hubble parameter is required to be an increasing function of time.\nLooking at some of the models reconstructed in the previous sections, we can see that the Hubble parameter (25)\nis a periodic function that reproduces a cyclic Universe. From the effective EoS parameter (41), it is clear that this\nmodel exhibits periods of super-accelerating expansion and it does not contain any future singularity. To find out\nif the model (25) may lead to a little rip, one has to determine the duration of each cycle and the strength of the\neffective repulsive force reproduced by the F (R) terms and compare with the binding forces of coupled systems (as\nfor example the Solar System). However, to ensure that a little rip is reproduced, one has to study models of eternal\nacceleration but free of future singularities, which may have a stronger growth in time than those models containing\nbig rip singularities. Let us use the reconstruction technique using Eqs. (12-21). As an example, we consider the\nfunction,\nU (\u03c6) = e\u2212\u03b2e\n\n\u03b1\u03c6\n\n(45)\n\n,\n\nwhere \u03b1 and \u03b2 are constants. Then, by the expression (21), the Hubble parameter and the scale factor yield,\nH(t) = h0 e\u03b1t + h1 ,\n\n\u2192\n\na(t) = a0 e4\u03b2e\n\n\u03b1t\n\n+6\u03b1t\n\n(46)\n\n.\n\nwhere h0 = 4\u03b1\u03b2 and h1 = 6\u03b1. It is straightforward to see that the function (46) describes a Universe, where for small\ntimes t \u226a \u03b1, the Hubble parameter can be approximated as a constant, reproducing a de Sitter solution, as in the\ncase of \u039bCDM model. For large times, the Universe ends in an eternal phantom phase, where the EoS parameter\nwF (R) < \u22121, but without big rip singularity. Nevertheless, a little rip (dissolution of bound structures) might occur\nin a finite time, similarly to the model presented in Ref. [5], as it is pointed out below. The functions P (\u03c6) and Q(\u03c6)\ncan be easily reconstructed by the expressions (15) and (20),\nP (\u03c6) = e4\u03b2e\n\n\u03b1\u03c6\n\n,\n\nQ(\u03c6) = \u22126\u03b12 (3 + 4\u03b2e\u03b1\u03c6 )(3 + 8\u03b2e\u03b1\u03c6 )e4\u03b2e\n\n\u03b1\u03c6\n\n.\n\n(47)\n\nThe F (R) action that reproduces the solution (46) can be calculated by inverting the expression of the Ricci scalar\nR = 6(2H 2 + \u1e22) and by using the expression (13), which yields,\n\"\n# q\nr\nR\nR\n+ 25\n(48)\nF (R) = C1 + C2 4\n+ 75 e 12R0 16 .\nR0\n\u221a\nwhere R0 = \u03b12 , C1 = \u221224e\u221239/12 R0 , and C2 = 2 3R0 . Hence, we have reconstructed F (R) model which is able to\nreproduce a super-accelerated (eternal) phase, which does not lead to a future singularity. Note that the action (48)\nturns out to be the Einstein-Hilbert action plus some corrections for small values of the Ricci curvature R, where the\nexponential functions are expanded in power series,\nF (R) \u223c \u03ba1 R + \u03ba2\n\nR2\nR3\n+ \u03ba3 2 + * * * .\nR0\nR0\n\n(49)\n\n\f8\nHere the couplings \u03bai are constants depending on C1,2 . Hence, for small values of the Ricci scalar the action reduces\nto the action for General Relativity plus power-law curvature corrections, as R2 , which is known recipe to cure the\nsingularities and which has a viable behavior ([13]). Hence, the action (48) represents a viable model where GR can\nbe recovered while the curvature scalar corrections remain small. It is important that such additional corrections\nbecome relevant close to the little rip evolution. In order to estimate the time for the little rip induced dissolution of\nbound structures in a naive way, one might compare the energy-density of a bound system as the Solar System with\nthe density \u03c1F (R) . For the model (46), such density can be approximated for large times by\n\u03c1F (R) = \u03c10 e2\u03b1t ,\n\n(50)\n\nwhere \u03c10 is a constant that can be set by imposing that the current value of the energy-density is \u03c1F (R) (t0 ) = \u03ba32 H02 \u223c\n10\u221247 GeV4 , where the age of the Universe is taken to be t0 \u223c 13.73 Gyrs, according to Ref. [14]. One can set the time\nof the little rip dissolution occurrence when the gravitational coupling of the Sun-Earth system is broken due to the\n3\ncosmological expansion. By assuming a mean density of the Sun-Earth system given by \u03c1\u2299\u2212\u2295 = 0.594\u00d710\u22123 kg/m \u223c\n4\n\u221221\n10\nGeV , the time for the little rip dissolution of bound structures is,\ntLR = 13.73 Gyrs +\n\n29.93\n.\n\u03b1\n\n(51)\n\nHence, depending on the parameter \u03b1, the appearance of the little rip may last shorter or longer. For example, when\n\u03b1 = 10\u22121 Gyrs\u22121 , the little rip occurs at the Universe age of tLR = 313.03 Gyrs, while for \u03b1 \u2265 1 Gyrs\u22121 , the time for\nthe decoupling will be much shorter.\nA lot of models can be reconstructed in frames of F (R) gravity which are able to reproduce a super-accelerating\nphase free of singularities. Let us consider, for example, a Hubble parameter that reproduces a phantom Universe\nwithout big rip [7],\nH2 =\n\nH02\n(t \u2212 t0 )2 = H0 N + H1 .\n4\n\n(52)\n\nHere we have introduced the number of e-foldings N = ln aa0 instead of the cosmological time t. For the Universe\ndescribed by the function (52), the effective EoS parameter is less than \u22121, so it also describes a phantom evolution\nbut free of future singularities. By using the reconstruction technique from Ref. [7], the action that reproduces the\nabove solution is given by,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 R \u2212 3H0\nF (R) = K \u22122, \u2212 ;\n,\n(53)\n2 12H0\nwhere K(a, b, x) is the Kummers serie. In this model, the energy-density is given by,\n\u03c1F (R) = \u03c10 (t \u2212 t0 )2 ,\n\n(54)\n\nwhere t0 = 0 as the origin of the Universe evolution. Then, by adjusting the value for \u03c10 with the present value of\nthe energy-density as in the above model, the little rip occurs when the Universe age is t = 137.3 \u00d7 1012 Gyrs, which\nclearly grows much slower than for above model.\nHence, we have shown here that F (R) gravity is able to reproduce successfully a phantom scenario free of future\nsingularity, where the little rip occurs at the time which depends completely on the expansion growth rate of the\nmodel.\nWe are now interested to explore the corresponding picture in the Einstein frame for those solutions describing\na little rip in F (R) gravity. In order to reconstruct the action in the Einstein frame, one has to use a conformal\ntransformation that removes the strong coupling in the action (12),\ngE\u03bc\u03bd = \u03a92 g\u03bc\u03bd ,\nwhere the subscript\n\nE\n\nwhere \u03a92 = P (\u03c6) ,\n\nstands for Einstein frame.

By\napplying the conformal transformation (55), the action in the Einstein frame (57) is described by the kinetic term\nand the scalar potential,\n\u03c9(\u03c6) = 4\u03b12 \u03b2 2 e2\u03b1\u03c6 ,\n\nand U (\u03c6) = \u22126\u03b12 (3 + 4\u03b2e\u03b1\u03c6 )(3 + 8\u03b2e\u03b1\u03c6 )e\u22124\u03b2e\n\n\u03b1\u03c6\n\n.\n\n(59)\n\nThe solution is transformed as,\naE (t) = a0 e6(\u03b2e\n\n\u03b1t\n\n+\u03b1t)\n\n,\n\ntE =\n\nZ\n\n2\u03b2e\u03b1t\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nez\n.\nz\n\n(60)\n\nHere the second expression is given by an exponential integral. In order to calculate an exact expression for aE (tE ),\nlet us approximate the exponential e\u03b1t \u223c 1 + \u03b1t + O(t2 ) for small times, so that the solution can be expressed as,\naE (tE ) = aE0 t6E e6\u03b2\u03b3tE ,\n\nHE (tE ) = 6\u03b2\u03b3 +\n\n6\n,\ntE\n\n(61)\n\nwhere \u03b3 = \u03b1e\u22122\u03b2 . Then, it is straightforward to see that the Universe described in the Einstein frame not only\ndoes not describe a super-accelerating expansion evolution but it also contains a singularity, a type of initial or Big\nBang singularity. On the same time the solution in the Jordan frame was free of singularities. The singularity of the\nEinstein frame universe is probably the manifestation of little rip (dissolution of bound structures).\nLet us consider now the inverse reconstruction by studying first the little rip scenario with quintessence/phantom\nfields described by the action (6), and then reconstruct the F (R) action by means of a conformal transformation. It is\nwell-known that any cosmological solution can be reconstructed with minimally coupled quintessence/phantom fields\nscalar fields (see Ref. [15]). As an example, let us consider the kinetic term and the scalar potential\n\u03c9(\u03c6) = \u2212\n\n2\nh0 \u03b1e\u03b1\u03c6 ,\n\u03ba2\n\nV (\u03c6) =\n\n\u0001\n1\n3h20 e2\u03b1\u03c6 + (6h0 h1 + h0 \u03b1)e\u03b1\u03c6 + 3h21 .\n2\n\u03ba\n\n(62)\n\nUsing the FRW equations and Eqs.(7), the solution for the Hubble parameter and the scalar field are\nHE (t) = h0 e\u03b1tE + h1 ,\n\n\u03c6(tE ) = tE ,\n\n(63)\n\nThat coincides with the solution found in (46) reproducing the same little rip evolution as in F (R) gravity. In this\ncase the equation of state parameter is,\nw\u03c6 =\n\n1\n2\n2 \u03c9(\u03c6)\u03c6\u0307\n1\n2\n2 \u03c9(\u03c6)\u03c6\u0307\n\n\u2212 V (\u03c6)\n+ V (\u03c6)\n\n= \u22121 \u2212\n\n2h0 \u03b1\n.\n\u03b1\n3(h0 e 2 tE + h1 e\u2212\u03b1tE )2\n\n(64)\n\nClearly this EoS parameter describes a scalar field which has a phantom behavior, where its EoS parameter w\u03c6 < \u22121\nand only tends to \u22121 for tE \u2192 \u221e. However, as a novelty compared with the usual phantom scalar fields (Ref. [15]),\nhere there is no finite time future singularity, but little rip evolution occurs. For this example, the time for the\ndissolution of the Sun-Earth system is given by (51).\nLet us now attempt to reconstruct the corresponding F (R) by applying a conformal transformation to the action\n(6). It is well-known that F (R) gravity can be described by a non-propagating scalar field (12), so that the conformal\ntransformation must remove the scalar kinetic term in the action (6):\n\" r Z\n#\np\n2\n2\n2\ng\u03bc\u03bdE = \u03a9 g\u03bc\u03bd , where \u03a9 = exp \u00b1\n(65)\n\u03ba d\u03c6 \u03c9(\u03c6) ,\n3\nThe corresponding Jordan frame action yields,\ni\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee h \u221a2 R \u221a\nZ\ni\nh \u221a\n\u221a\n\u00b1 3 \u03ba d\u03c6 \u03c9(\u03c6)\nR\n2\n\u221a\ne\n\u03ba\nd\u03c6\n\u03c9(\u03c6)\n\u00b12\n3\nS = d4 x \u2212g \uf8f0\nV (\u03c6)\uf8fb ,\nR\u2212e\n2\u03ba2\n\n(66)\n\n\f10\nThis action is basically the action given in (12) in vacuum, which is equivalent to F (R) gravity. However, for the\ncase of a phantom scalar that reproduces the little rip, it is straightforward to see that the corresponding action (66)\nturns out to be complex, as the conformal transformation (65) is also complex due to fact that kinetic term in (64)\nis negative. This is the known result for the case of a phantom scalar cosmology containing future singularity (see\nRef. [16]). As in the case of phantom singular Universes, for the case of little rip, a way to reconstruct a consistent\naction in the Jordan frame can be achieved by adding an extra phantom fluid (see Ref. [17]). However, in general\na little rip Universe described in the Einstein frame owns an inconsistent action in the Jordan frame. Thus, it is\nexplicitly demonstrated that little rip evolution may be reconstructed in frames of modified gravity.\nVI.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIn summary, we developed the reconstructed method for F (R) theory which admits cyclic and ekpyrotic universe\nsolution. As a rule, the corresponding reconstructed F (R) action is given implicitly. Nevertheless, its expansion\naround General Relativity action with curvature corrections is always possible as is shown explicitly. The comparison\nwith scalar-tensor theory which also leads to cyclic evolution is made. Our results indicate that geometrical actions\nusually considered as inflation source may lead to more complicated cyclic universe.\nWe also presented the reconstruction of F (R) theory leading to little rip universe. Little rip dark energy represents\nnon-singular phantom cosmology. It was proposed in Ref. [5] as viable alternative to \u039bCDM model because it is\nconsistent with observational data. Being effectively non-singular one, little rip cosmology shows the dissolution\nof bound structures similarly to Big Rip cosmology. It is demonstrated that same effect occurs for F (R) gravity\nadmitting little rip solution: the corresponding time left for such dissolution is estimated. It is interesting that\ntransforming little rip F (R) gravity to scalar-tensor form (the Einstein frame), the little rip universe is transformed\nto qualitatively different (Big Bang type) singular universe. The appearance of initial singularity in Einstein frame\nindicates the manifestation of dissolution time in Einstein frame. Finally, it is shown that other types of non-singular\nsuper-accelerating universe may be also reconstructed in F (R) gravity. Note also that the kind of solutions studied\nhere can be also extended to Ho\u0159ava-Lifshitz gravity (see Ref. [18]).\nNote that modified gravity theories under discussion for cyclic universe are relevant mainly for early universe\nand/or may be expanded as General Relativity action plus corrections. Hence, such theories easily pass the local\ntests. From another side, it remains to understand how natural and realistic the cyclic/ekpyrotic/little rip universes\nare. The natural recipe for this purpose is the study of perturbations. However, such investigation should be done\nfor different epochs showing subsequent transition from the earlier epoch to the following oneand also with account\nof corresponding matter/radiation. This is quite complicated technical problem which lies outside of the scopes of\ncurrent work.\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe are grateful to J. Khoury and R. Scherrer for useful remarks.
