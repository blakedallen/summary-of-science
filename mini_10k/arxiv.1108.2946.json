INTRODUCTION\nA primary goal of modern extragalactic astronomy is to\nreduce the complex, stochastic process of galaxy formation into a few fundamental physical parameters. Such\na goal appears tractable given the tight scaling relations\nexhibited by galaxies over a large dynamic range in observed properties, which to first order may be tied to a\nsingle physical characteristic (Disney et al. 2008). For\nexample, measures of galaxy size, luminosity, and a virialized dynamical quantity (such as the circular velocity in\nrotationally supported systems and velocity dispersion in\npressure-dominated systems) demonstrate strong covariance. Correlations among galaxy properties are found\nin two-dimensional scatter plots (e.g., Courteau et al.\n2007; Nair et al. 2010; Saintonge & Spekkens 2011), lines\nthrough multi-dimensional space (e.g., Tollerud et al.\n2011), and more complex, multi-dimensional manifolds\n(e.g., Zaritsky et al. 2008). Empirical and theoretical understanding of these relations over cosmic time (as in,\ne.g., Dutton et al. 2011a) are critical.\nTwo long-standing scaling relations are the Tully\u2013\nFisher relation (Tully & Fisher 1977, hereafter the TF\nwestfall@astro.rug.nl\n1 Kapteyn Astronomical Institute, University of Groningen,\nLandleven 12, 9747 AD Groningen, the Netherlands\n2 National Science Foundation (USA) International Research\nFellow\n3 Department of Astronomy,\nUniversity of WisconsinMadison, 475 N.

These fundamental relations are strongly\nlinked to mass: The baryonic TF (BTF) relation\n(McGaugh et al. 2000; McGaugh 2005), created by replacing total luminosity with total baryonic mass, exhibits less scatter than the nominal TF relation over a\nwide range of luminosity and spiral type. The massbased FP (Bolton et al. 2007), incorporating the total\n(baryonic+dark-matter[DM]) mass surface density instead of surface brightness, also exhibits lower scatter\nthan its luminosity-based counterpart. It is interesting that the residuals are reduced for both the BTF\nand mass-based FP relation despite the exclusion of\nDM from the former. The tightness of the BTF implies that either DM is a rather negligible mass component or there exists a strict proportionality, in both\nrelative amplitude and distribution, between DM and\nbaryonic mass in spiral galaxies. The former is incompatible with our current understanding of gravity and\nthe current paradigm of hierarchical disk-galaxy formation (see, e.g., Fall & Efstathiou 1980; Dalcanton et al.\n1997; Mo et al. 1998; Agertz et al. 2011), and the latter\nis tantamount to the discomforting disk-halo conspiracy6\n6 The observed fine tuning of the relative fraction and distribution of baryonic and DM mass required to produce a total rotation curve that is dominated by baryonic matter at small radii\nwith a smooth transition to a roughly constant rotation speed at\nlarge radii (cf. Casertano & van Gorkom 1991; Amorisco & Bertin\n\n\f2\n\nWestfall et al.\n\n(van Albada & Sancisi 1986, hereafter vAS86). One can\nbegin to address this contentious issue by placing direct\nconstraints on the detail mass composition of galaxies.\nAlthough there are multiple methods of measuring the\ntotal mass enclosed within a given radius (e.g., dynamics, lensing), a robust decomposition of total mass into\nfractional contributions from DM, stars, and the interstellar medium (ISM) is non-trivial. Measurements of\nthe atomic-gas mass can be made directly using 21cm\nH i emission, and molecular-gas mass can be estimated\nusing CO emission. However, stellar mass estimates\ndepend on the calibration of stellar mass-to-light ratios, \u03a5\u2217 , via resolved stellar populations in the most\nnearby (dwarf) galaxies or stellar-population-synthesis\n(SPS) modeling of integrated light. The latter remains substantially uncertain (Conroy et al. 2009, 2010;\nConroy & Gunn 2010).7\nRotation-curve mass decompositions provide upper\nlimits on \u03a5\u2217 when one adopts the \"maximum-disk\"\nhypothesis, the assumption that the rotation velocity\nat the center is dominated by the luminous matter\n(vAS86). For example, Bell & de Jong (2001) used the\n\"maximum-disk\" rotation curve decompositions made by\nVerheijen (2001, hereafter V01) to place limits on the\nallowed \u03a5\u2217 . However, rotation curves cannot provide\nunique measurements of \u03a5\u2217 as we have recently illustrated (Bershady et al. 2010a, hereafter Paper I); inference of \u03a5\u2217 based on rotation-curve mass decompositions are unconstrained due to the disk-halo degeneracy\n(van Albada et al. 1985).\nGiven the uncertainty in SPS model zero-points and\nthe disk-halo degeneracy, a direct measurement of \u03a5\u2217\nis needed. Following the work of Bahcall & Casertano\n(1984), van der Kruit & Freeman (1984, 1986), and\nBottema (1993), the DiskMass Survey (DMS; Paper I)\naims to tackle this problem via dynamical measurements\nof the mass surface density, \u03a3dyn , of &40 low-inclination,\nlate-type galaxies. Our measurements uniquely describe\nthe baryonic mass distributions and DM-halo density\nprofiles, \u03c1DM , of each galaxy within \u223c3 disk scale lengths\n(hR ), thereby breaking the disk-halo degeneracy and allowing for detailed calculations of disk-galaxy mass budgets. In this paper, we focus on providing a detailed,\ninitial example of these calculations using UGC 463, located at equatorial (J2000.0) coordinates (RA,DEC) =\n(00h 43m 32.s 5,+14d20m34s ). We continue our series by\nsummarizing the baryonic mass fractions in 29 additional\ngalaxies in Bershady et al. (2011; hereafter Paper V),\nsubmitted.\nHere we summarize some salient properties of UGC\n463: It is a well isolated galaxy with a moderately-high\nextrapolated central disk surface brightness (Paper I),\nwhich is a factor of \u223c 2 above the mean derived by\nFreeman (1970). It is of late type (SABc; Paper I) and\ndemonstrates an interesting three-arm spiral structure.\nThe SDSS g-band surface photometry demonstrates a\n2010).\n7 Here, the remarkable success of McGaugh (2005) in reducing\nthe residuals in his BTF relation by using \u03a5\u2217 as derived from the\nmass-discrepancy\u2013acceleration relation (McGaugh 2004) is noteworthy; however, it is possible that this is more reflective of the\nability of MOND (Milgrom 1983) to fit rotation curves and/or the\ndisk-halo conspiracy than it is of the absolute calibration of these\n\u03a5\u2217 measurements.\n\nclear Type II surface-brightness profile, as defined by\nFreeman (1970), with a profile \"break\" at a radius of\n\u223c 15\u2032\u2032 , well within the field-of-view (FOV) of our kinematic data; the break becomes less pronounced toward\nlonger wavelengths. The disk is also bright in the midand far-infrared Spitzer bands, suggestive of significant\nstar-formation activity and molecular gas mass. In general, UGC 463 is unexceptional in its optical and nearinfrared (NIR) color, size, and luminosity; however, it is\nslightly redder and more luminous (in MK ) than typical\nof galaxies in the DMS Phase-B sample (as defined in\nPaper I).\nOur study of UGC 463 is a detailed example in the\nuse of our full suite of data to produce quantities of\nfundamental relevance to the science goals of the DMS\n(Paper I), following much of the formalism developed in\nBershady et al. (2010b, hereafter Paper II). Given the\nlarge number of observational ingredients, we have relocated some detailed information to future papers, which\nwe refer to throughout our discussion. An outline of\nour paper is as follows: Section 2 presents all the data\nproducts. We derive the on-sky geometric projection of\nthe disk using our two-dimensional kinematic data in\nSection 3, including an extensive discussion of the inclination, i. Based on this projection geometry, we produce azimuthally averaged kinematic profiles and beamsmearing corrections and discuss the axial symmetry of\nthe galaxy in Section 4. In Section 5, we derive salient\nproperties of the disk including the shape of the disk stellar velocity ellipsoid (SVE), the disk stability, mass surface densities of all baryonic components, and dynamical\nmass-to-light ratios. In Section 6, we produce a detailed\nmass budget for UGC 463 out to 15 kpc (\u223c 4.2 scale\nlengths); this analysis relies on a traditional rotationcurve mass decomposition but uses our direct measurements of \u03a5\u2217 . Having established the mass distribution of\nall the baryonic components, Section 6 also presents the\nDM-halo density and enclosed-mass distribution. Therefore, Sections 2 \u2013 4 are largely concerned with data handling, whereas Sections 5 \u2013 6 produce the scientifically\nmotivated calculations that result from these data. We\nsummarize our study in Section 7.\nWe note here the nomenclature \u01eb(x) signifies the measurement error in x, x is the azimuthal average of x,\nand hxi is the combined radial and azimuthal average of\nx. When quoting two sets of errors in any quantity (as\ndone in the Abstract), the first and second set provide\nthe random and systematic uncertainties, respectively.\n2.

Contour levels are: \u03bcH\u03b1 - 22, 21, 20 mag arcsec\u22122 ; \u03bcMg i - 22.7, 21.7, 20.7 mag arcsec\u22122 ; VHi ,\nVH\u03b1 , V\u2217 - 4360, 4390, 4420, 4450, 4480, 4520, 4540 km s\u22121 ; \u03a3Hi - 3, 6, 9 M\u2299 pc\u22122 ; \u03a3H2 - 15, 30, 60 M\u2299 pc\u22122 ; and \u03c3\u2217 - 30, 45, 60\nkm s\u22121 . Gray contours are used to ease visibility with respect to the background grayscale image. The contours of \u03bcH\u03b1 (gray) and \u03bcMg i\n(black) are overplotted on the \u03bcg image for comparison.\n\nThe distance to UGC 463 is used to calculate: (1)\nthe total absolute K-band magnitude, MK , providing\nan inclination measurement via inversion of the TF relation (Section 3.1.2); and (2) the disk scale height\nbased on a measured scale length in kpc (see equation 1 from Paper II). In Section 3.1.1, we find Vsys =\n4460 \u00b1 1 km s\u22121 , consistent with Vsys = 4452 \u00b1 9 km s\u22121\n(Huchra et al. 1999) provided by NED.8 Applying the\n104 km s\u22121 flow correction (Mould et al. 2000), we cal8 The NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database, operated by the Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under\ncontract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\n\nculate a flow-corrected velocity of Vflow = 4356 \u00b1 52\nkm s\u22121 , where we have taken half the flow correction as\nits error (Paper II). Using H0 = 73 \u00b1 5 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121\nfor Hubble's constant (provided by NED, cf. Riess et al.\n2009; Larson et al. 2011), we calculate a flow-corrected\ndistance of D = Vflow /H0 = 59.67 \u00b1 0.01 \u00b1 4.15 Mpc; the\nsystematic error is dominated by the uncertainty in H0 .\n2.2.

Photometric measurements are in AB\nmagnitudes for SDSS data and Vega-based magnitudes\nfor 2MASS data. SDSS and 2MASS images are, respectively, 10.\u2032 2 \u00d7 13.\u2032 8 and 8.\u2032 3 \u00d7 17.\u2032 1 with UGC 463 well\nseparated from the frame edges.\n2.2.1. Surface Photometry\nGiven the basic image reduction and photometric calibration provided by SDSS and 2MASS, our surface photometry is primarily concerned with sky-background subtraction and masking sources other than UGC 463.\nSource catalogs have been created for each band using Source Extractor.9 Each catalog has been visually\ninspected and pruned of erroneous source identifications,\nsuch as along meteor streaks or diffraction spikes; these\nfeatures are masked from our final results by including\npseudo-sources in our catalog. We have created a master\ncatalog for the region surrounding UGC 463 by merging\nthe catalogs from all bands, identifying sources detected\nin multiple bands.\nUsing the IRAF10 task imsurfit, we determine the\nsky background of each image by fitting a Legendre polynomial surface (with cross terms) to each image where\nall sources and artifacts are replaced, initially, by a (\u00b13)\nsigma-clipped mean of the image. After the lowest-order\nsurface fit (2-\u00d72-order), masked regions are replaced by\nthe fitted surface values as the fit order is increased. By\ninspection, we find there is little improvement in the sky\nflatness when using surfaces of more than 9-\u00d79-order\n(terms up to x8 ), and higher order fits begin to introduce\nartificial structure. The backgrounds of SDSS images are\ngenerally well-behaved, whereas the 2MASS H- and Kband data exhibit significant background structure.\nSurface photometry has been performed on each image\nafter subtracting the sky background and masking all artifacts and sources, except for UGC 463. Source masking is forced to be identical in every band. From these\nmasked images, we perform elliptical aperture photometry over a range of radii, each with an aspect ratio and\norientation coinciding with the derived geometry of the\ndisk discussed in Section 3.1.

This extends the\nNIR surface-brightness profile to larger radii. The \"JHK\nbandpass\" has an effective band-width of \u03b4\u03bb/\u03bb = 0.62\nand a Vega zero-point of 1062 Jy.\nFigure 2 provides all the surface photometry used in\nour present study of UGC 463. We apply Galactic extinction corrections11 of Ag = 0.357, Ar = 0.242, Ai = 0.173,\nand AK = 0.034; no extinction correction is applied to\n\u03bcJHK (see Section 2.2.2). We also plot the UGC 463 Kband photometry from de Jong & van der Kruit (1994),\nwhich is in very good agreement with our 2MASS photometry at R < 40\u2032\u2032 . Table 2 provides the result of fitting\nan exponential disk to all bands, including the JHK data,\ndemonstrating marginal change in the best-fitting scale\nlength and no evident trend with wavelength. The Table provides the radii over which the exponential disk is\nfit; the minimum radius is always 15\u2032\u2032 in order to avoid\nnon-exponential features seen near the galaxy center.\n2.2.2. K-Band Surface Brightness Profile\nWe apply two corrections to \u03bcJHK and use it as the primary NIR surface-brightness measurement for our study\nof UGC 463: (1) a color correction to produce a more\naccurate K-band surface-brightness profile at large radius and (2) an instrumental-smoothing correction.

We find \u03bcK \u2212 \u03bcJHK = \u22120.47 \u00b1 0.03 at R < 40\u2032\u2032\nwith a maximum deviation from the mean of 0.05 magnitudes, which is at most \u223c \u01eb(\u03bcK ). The NIR color gradients are small over this radius, with \u2206(J \u2212 H) . 0.2 and\n\u2206(J \u2212 K) . 0.1, and roughly consistent with no color\ngradient to within the photometric error.\nOur instrumental-smoothing correction effectively performs a one-dimensional bulge-disk decomposition of\n\u03bcJHK . We assume the central light concentration intrinsically follows a S\u00e9rsic (1963) profile. After first subtracting an exponential surface-brightness profile fitted\nto \u03bcJHK data between 10\u2032\u2032 < R < 33\u2032\u2032 , we model the\ncentral light concentration within R < 8\u2032\u2032 by a S\u00e9rsic\nprofile convolved with a Gaussian kernel, assuming the\nlatter is a good approximation for all instrumental effects. We find a best-fitting S\u00e9rsic index of n = 1.5\nand an effective (half-light) radius of Re = 1.\u2032\u2032 7. Random errors in this modeling are approximated by the\nroot-mean-square (RMS) difference between the measured and modeled central light profile. We assume that\nthe \"intrinsic disk surface brightness\" is the remainder\nof the profile after subtracting the model of the centrallight concentration, the \"intrinsic central light concentration\" is the S\u00e9rsic component of the model, and the\n\"intrinsic \u03bcJHK profile\" is the sum of these two components; our instrumental-smoothing correction then consists of the difference between the measured and \"intrinsic\" \u03bcJHK profile. We adopt a conservative 50% systematic error in this correction due to the inherent uncertainties in the true parameterization of the central light\nconcentration and instrumental-smoothing kernel. Although relevant to our assessment of any central mass\nconcentration in our calculations of \u03a3dyn (Section 5.3),\n\u03a5disk\n\u2217,K (Section 5.6), and the mass budget (Section 6),\nour instrumental-smoothing correction is immaterial to\nthe fundamental conclusions of our paper.\nHereafter, we refer to the corrected JHK measurement\nas \u03bc\u2032K ; hR always refers to the measurement based on\nthis profile unless otherwise stated. The fully corrected\n\u03bc\u2032K profile is shown in, e.g., Figure 4.\n\nparent magnitude, mK , using the 2MASS K-band data\naccording to the procedure used by V01: We measure a\nroughly isophotal magnitude at \u03bcK = 21.5 mag arcsec\u22122\n(the rough surface-brightness limit occurring at R . 55\u2032\u2032 )\nand extrapolate to infinity based on the fitted exponential disk (hR = 12.\u2032\u2032 3 \u00b1 0.\u2032\u2032 3). We find mK (R \u2264 55\u2032\u2032 ) =\n9.45 \u00b1 0.01 and a correction of -0.09 mag for the extrapolation of the disk. Accounting for Galactic-extinction\n(AK = 0.034), we find mK = 9.32 \u00b1 0.02.\n2.2.4. Internal Dust Extinction\nLeft uncorrected, \u03bc\u2032K may overestimate our dynamical\nmass-to-light ratios (Section 5.6) due to internal dust extinction in K-band, AiK . Using the dust-slab model from\nTully & Fouque (1985)12 and i = 27\u25e6 \u00b1 2\u25e6 (Section 3.1),\nwe calculate the function Ai=27\n(R) as shown in Figure\nK\n2, which has a maximum of Ai=27\n(R = 0) = 0.02 \u00b1 0.01\nK\nat the galaxy center. Assuming AV /E(B \u2212 V ) = 3.1\n(Cardelli et al. 1989), we calculate AK /E(g \u2212 i) = 0.18 \u00b1\n0.02, which we use to apply an internal reddening correction to our g \u2212 i color when comparing our dynamical \u03a5\u2217 measurements to those predicted by SPS modeling. Figure 2 plots the uncorrected g \u2212 r, r \u2212 i, and\ng \u2212 i colors, as well as our internal-reddening-corrected\n(g \u2212 i)0 color. Compared to more realistic radiativetransfer modeling including a clumpy ISM and spiral\nstructure, these simple dust-slab model predictions tend\nto overestimate both the level of dust extinction and\nreddening toward high inclination; the predictions are\nmore reasonable at the low inclination appropriate for\nUGC 463 (Schechtman-Rook et al., in prep). Given the\nmarginal extinction in K-band and reddening of g \u2212 i,\nthe simpler model is sufficient for our purposes.\n2.2.5. Dust Emission\nWe note here that the K-band also contains emission\nfrom hot dust and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons;\nhowever, based on a preliminary modeling of the spectral\nenergy distribution of our full suite of NIR and Spitzer\nimaging, we expect this to be no more than a 3% contribution, which is immaterial to the conclusions of this\npaper.\n\n2.2.3. Total Apparent K-Band Magnitude\nIn Section 3.1.2, we use MK to calculate the inverseTF inclination of UGC 463 based on the TF relations\nderived by V01. Therefore, we calculate the total ap-\n\n2.3. Ionized-Gas Kinematics\n12\n\nSee also discussion in V01 and Paper II.\n\n\f6\n\nWestfall et al.\n\nWe primarily use ionized-gas kinematics obtained\nby the SparsePak13 (Bershady et al. 2004, 2005)\nand PPak14 (Verheijen et al. 2004; Roth et al. 2005;\nKelz et al. 2006) integral-field units (IFUs), augmented\nby our H i observations, to produce the total rotation\ncurve of UGC 463. These ionized-gas data also provide\nmeasurements of the gas velocity dispersion, which we\nuse to correct the gas rotation speed to the circular speed\n(Section 4.3.1). Below, we briefly describe the IFU data\navailable for UGC 463 and our extraction of the ionizedgas kinematics.\n2.3.1. H\u03b1, N ii, & S ii Spectroscopy\nSparsePak integral-field spectroscopy (IFS) of UGC\n463 was obtained on the nights of UT 02 January 2002\nand UT 20 October 2002, following the setup provided\nfor the H\u03b1 region as listed in Table 1 of Paper I. We\nobtained four pointings during the January run and an\nadditional three pointings during the October run. The\npointings nominally followed the 3-pointing dither pattern designed to fully sample the 72\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 71\u2032\u2032 FOV of\nSparsePak (Bershady et al. 2004);15 the fourth pointing\nduring the January 2002 run was a repeat of the center pointing. We obtained 2\u00d715-minute exposures for\neach pointing. Each exposure pair is combined, before\nextraction of the spectra, while simultaneously removing cosmic rays. Spatially overlapping fibers among the\nseven pointings are not combined but treated individually throughout our analysis. Further details of the reduction of these data (basic image reduction, spectral\nextraction, wavelength calibration, and sky and continuum subtraction) are provided by Swaters et al., in prep,\nlargely following methods described in Andersen et al.\n(2006) with continuum-subtraction techniques described\nin Bershady et al. (2005). The RMS difference between\nthe catalogued and measured line centroids for the ThAr\nlines used in our wavelength calibration, i.e. the \"wavelength calibration error,\" is typically . 0.1 km s\u22121 .\nWe also measure the instrumental dispersion, \u03c3inst ,\nas a function of wavelength for all spectra, using the\nThAr emission lines from our calibration lamp spectra\n(Paper II). The intrinsic widths of the ThAr features\nare negligible such that the second moment of these\nlines is equivalent to \u03c3inst to good approximation. After identifying a set of appropriate (unblended) lines\nfrom the calibration spectrum, we fit single Gaussian\nfunctions to each line using the same code described by\nAndersen et al. (2008) to fit the emission-line features\nin our galaxy spectra (see also Swaters et al., in prep).\nFor each fiber, we fit a quadratic Legendre polynomial to\n\u03c3inst (\u03bb), which is used to interpolate \u03c3inst at any wavelength. The average instrumental broadening across the\nfull spectral range for all fibers is 13 km s\u22121 .\n2.3.2. O iii Spectroscopy\n13 Mounted on the 3.5-meter WIYN telescope, a joint facility\nof the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Indiana University, Yale\nUniversity, and the National Optical Astronomy Observatories.\n14 Mounted with PMAS on the 3.5-meter telescope at the Calar\nAlto Observatory, operated jointly by the Max-Planck-Institut fr\nAstronomie (MPIA) in Heidelberg, Germany, and the Instituto de\nAstrofsica de Andaluca (CSIC) in Granada, Spain.\n15 http://www.astro.wisc.edu/ mab/research/sparsepak/\n~\n\nOur optical continuum spectra in the Mg i region\ntaken with both SparsePak and PPak - described in\nSections 2.4.1 and 2.4.2, respectively - have sufficient\nspectral range to include the [O iii]\u03bb5007 emission feature. Therefore, we also use these lines as tracers of the\nionized-gas kinematics. No adjustment of the continuumdata reduction recipe was needed to accommodate the\nproper handling of the emission features. Instrumental\ndispersions are calculated as described in Sections 2.4.1\nand 2.4.2 for the SparsePak and PPak data, respectively.\n2.3.3. Kinematic Measurements\nIonized-gas kinematics are measured for all available\nemission lines. Following Andersen et al. (2008, see also\nAndersen et al. 2006), both single and double Gaussian\nline profiles are fitted in a 20\u00c5 window centered around\neach line. All Gaussian fits have been visually inspected\nto ensure each emission line was fitted properly. Velocities (cz) of each atomic species are calculated separately\nusing the wavelength of the Gaussian centroid. Of all fitted line profiles, 27% are better fit by a double Gaussian\nprofile (Andersen et al. 2008, Andersen et al., in prep);\nin these cases, a single component is used to measure the\nline-of-sight (LOS) velocity. Ionized-gas velocity dispersions, \u03c3gas , also use a single component and are corrected\nfor the measured instrumental line width.\nFor our H\u03b1-region spectroscopy, we combine all available velocity and velocity dispersion measurements\n(any combination of the [N ii]\u03bb6548, H\u03b1, [N ii]\u03bb6583,\n[S ii]\u03bb6716, and [S ii]\u03bb6731 lines) into an error-weighted\nmean velocity for each fiber. Due to the large uncertainties in \u03c3gas for lines other than H\u03b1, we only include\nmeasurements with \u01eb(\u03c3gas ) < 3 km s\u22121 in the combined\nvalue. In this spectral region, both velocities and \u03c3gas\nare dominated by the H\u03b1 line measurements due to the\nhigher S/N of these lines; hereafter, we refer to these\nkinematics as \"H\u03b1\" kinematics, despite their inclusion\nof other ionized atomic species.\nIn addition to the consistency check among measurements made by SparsePak and PPak, the [O iii] kinematics provide a useful comparison with the H\u03b1 results\n(see Section 4). However, the H\u03b1 line generally provides\nhigher quality kinematics and velocity fields: the line\nS/N is higher on average and the filling factor of the\nkinematic measurements in the disk of UGC 463 is more\nuniform. We eventually combine all ionized-gas kinematics into a single, axisymmetric set of measurements\n(Section 4.3); however, it is useful to keep in mind this\ndistinction between the merit of the H\u03b1 and [O iii] kinematic data.\n2.4. Stellar Kinematics\nOur optical continuum spectra are at the heart of this\npaper and, in fact, our entire survey. UGC 463 is among\na set of 19 galaxies in (and roughly half of) our Phase-B\nsample that have both SparsePak and PPak continuum\nspectroscopy near the Mg i triplet. This intentional duplication provides an internal consistency check of our\nstellar kinematics using two different instruments, and\nwe find excellent agreement among the observations (Section 4). Here, we provide information concerning our\nobservations and our derivation of the LOS stellar kinematics.\n\n\fThe DiskMass Survey. IV.\n\n7\n\n2.4.1. SparsePak Spectroscopy\nSparsePak IFS of UGC 463 was obtained using the\nMg i-region setup as listed in Table 1 of Paper I - primarily targeting Fe i and Mg i stellar-atmospheric absorption lines. The observation and reduction of these data\nare described by Westfall (2009); we review the salient\ndetails here.\nUGC 463 was observed on consecutive nights during\na single run from UT 23 \u2212 25 September 2006. Four,\nsix, and four 45-minute exposures were taken during the\nthree nights of observation, respectively. No dithering of\nthe pointing was applied between exposures; the original\npointing was repeated to the best of our ability for each\nnight. Exposures taken within a given night have been\ncombined into a single image, using an algorithm that\nsimultaneously rejects cosmic rays, and reduced (basic\nimage reduction, spectral extraction, wavelength calibration, and sky-subtraction) on a night-by-night basis. The\nbasic reduction procedures are nearly the same as that\nused for the H\u03b1 data (Section 2.3.1). The wavelength\ncalibration errors are typically . 0.1 km s\u22121 . Error spectra have been calculated in a robust and parallel analysis.\nThe repeatability of the pointing across the three nights\nof observation was good to less than one arcsecond, determined by Westfall (2009) by forcing the kinematic centers\nof all the SparsePak H\u03b1 and [O iii] data to follow from the\nsame on-sky kinematic geometry. Thus, the extracted\nspectra from each night have been combined on a fiberby-fiber basis and weighted by the spectral (S/N )2 . The\nweighting is relevant due to changing conditions; moon\nillumination increased for each night (from 1 \u2212 7%) and\na number of exposures (\u223c 30%) suffered from variable\ntransparency losses due to passing clouds, particularly\nduring the second night of observation. The combined\nspectra, from all 10.5 hours of integration, are analyzed\nin Section 2.4.3 to measure stellar kinematics for UGC\n463.\nUsing our calculated error spectra, Figure 3 plots the\nmean S/N of our SparsePak IFS as a function of radius\nagainst the g-band surface-brightness profile, demonstrating that we have measured stellar kinematics for\nfibers with \u03bcg \u223c 22.5 at S/N \u223c 3. The scale translation between mean S/N and \u03bcg assumes the data are\ndetector-limited (S/N \u221d flux), which is only an approximation for our data.\nFinally, we estimate \u03c3inst for both the template\nand galaxy spectra for use in measuring instrumentalbroadening corrections (Section 2.4.4). We use the same\napproach as described for the H\u03b1-region spectroscopy in\nSection 2.3.1 for both the galaxy and template observations. The average instrumental broadening for these\ngalaxy spectra is 11 km s\u22121 .\n2.4.2. PPak Spectroscopy\nPPak IFS of UGC 463 was obtained using the Mg iregion setup as listed in Table 1 of Paper I. Compared\nto the SparsePak optical continuum spectra, individual\nPPak spectra have approximately 1.5 times the spectral\nrange, 0.7 times the spectral resolution, and 0.6 times\nthe on-sky aperture per fiber; however, PPak contains\n4.4 times as many fibers as SparsePak in its main fiber\nbundle. These data are described by Martinsson (2011),\nwhich includes all Mg i-region data taken by PPak. Here,\n\nFigure 3. Mean S/N measurements for both our SparsePak (top)\nand PPak (bottom) Mg i-region IFS of UGC 463. Data are plotted\nas a function of radius and against the SDSS g-band profile (gray\nline; Section 2.2.1). Bars provide the range in S/N of all pixels\nover the full spectrum; upper limit arrows are used in cases where\nS/N drops below zero due to the random errors in sky subtraction.\nSpectra that have yielded stellar kinematics are plotted by filled\npoints and as open circles otherwise.\n\nwe briefly review the acquisition and reduction of the\ndata specifically for UGC 463.\nWe obtained two consecutive 1-hour exposures targeting UGC 463 on each of three nights from UT 13 \u2212 15\nNovember 2004, yielding six hours of total on-target\nintegration. Flexure corrections have been applied on\nan exposure-by-exposure basis, requiring spectral extraction, wavelength calibration, and sky subtraction to be\nperformed on each exposure individually. The RMS\nwavelength calibration error is typically of the same order as that found for the SparsePak observations (\u223c 0.1\nkm s\u22121 ). Error spectra have been calculated in a robust\nand parallel analysis. For UGC 463, no pointing offsets\nwere detected; the CCD of the guide camera of the PMAS\nspectrograph allows for accurate reacquisition of our target galaxies on subsequent nights. All six spectra for a\ngiven fiber have been combined using weights depending\non the instrumental resolution and the spectral S/N as\ndescribed by Martinsson (2011).\nFigure 3 provides the mean S/N of the PPak spectra, alongside that of the SparsePak spectra. Despite\nthe shorter integration time and smaller fiber aperture,\nthe PPak data have slightly higher mean S/N , an effect\nof both the lower spectral resolution and the better effi-\n\n\f8\n\nWestfall et al.\n\nciency of PMAS over the WIYN Bench Spectrograph.16\nInstrumental broadening measurements are performed\ndifferently for PPak data than described above for\nSparsePak data. PPak observations provide simultaneous calibration spectra in 15 fibers, evenly distributed\nalong the pseudo-slit among the galaxy spectra. These\nspectra have proven critical for applying the necessary\nflexure corrections (Martinsson 2011). Moreover, they\nprovide simultaneous measurements of the instrumental dispersion, obtained by fitting Gaussian functions to\nthe ThAr emission lines. Martinsson (2011) has fit a\nquadratic Legendre polynomial surface to these measurements of \u03c3inst for each object frame. We use this description of \u03c3inst to calculate the instrumental-dispersion corrections for both the ionized-gas and stellar kinematics\nmeasured from the PPak spectra. The mean instrumental dispersion across all fibers and all spectral channels\nis 17 km s\u22121 for our PPak data of UGC 463.\n2.4.3. Raw Kinematic Measurements\nWe use the Detector-Censored Cross-Correlation\n(DC3) software presented in Westfall et al. (2011, hereafter Paper III) to determine spatially resolved stellar kinematics in UGC 463 from both our SparsePak\nand PPak spectra. Based on a preliminary analysis\n(Paper II), we find a K1 III star provides a minimum\ntemplate-mismatch error of \u223c 5% in the observed velocity dispersion (\u03c3obs ) with no systematic trend in radius.\nIn the future, we can improve upon this by using composite templates; however, a 5% template-mismatch error in\n\u03c3obs is satisfactory for the present study.\nAs per our survey protocol (Paper I), we have observed\ntemplate stars in the Mg i region using both SparsePak\nand PPak. For the analysis here, we specifically use\nthe K1 III stars HD 167042 and HD 162555 for our\nSparsePak and PPak stellar kinematics, respectively; Table 3 presents salient information regarding the template\nspectra. Template star observations are performed under nominally the same spectrograph/telescope configuration as for our galaxy data. For both SparsePak and\nPPak, template stars are observed by drifting the star\nthrough the full FOV, yielding many spectra that are\ncombined to provide high-S/N templates; the final S/N\nof each template is provided in Table 3.\nWe fit any galaxy\u2013template cross-correlation (CC)\nfunction that peaks within a few hundred km s\u22121 of the\nsystemic velocity of UGC 463 (as recorded by NED) regardless of the S/N . For each fiber, we adopt a Gaussian broadening function, and we use a cubic Legendre\npolynomial to minimize continuum differences between\nthe broadened template and the fitted galaxy spectrum.\nAdditionally, we mask the [O iii]\u03bb5007 and [N i] (\u03bb5198\nand \u03bb5200) nebular emission regions from both the template and galaxy spectra. For the PPak data, the redshifted [O iii]\u03bb4960 line is also visible; however, DC3\nmasks the CC to a rest-wavelength range common to\nboth the galaxy and template spectrum, thereby automatically masking this line. Each CC fit has been visually inspected to insure the proper peak was considered\nby the fitting algorithm and that any unexpected arti16 Our data were taken before the completion of the upgrade to\nthe WIYN Bench Spectrograph that improved its overall efficiency\nby a factor of & 2 (Bershady et al. 2008; Knezek et al. 2010).\n\nfacts - poorly removed sky lines and/or cosmic-ray detections - were masked. Based on this inspection, spectra have been refit as necessary. Our stellar kinematic\nanalysis follows the expectations derived for random errors in Paper III. As assessed via \u03c72 and the velocity\nshift with respect to spatially neighboring fibers, we find\nreasonable fits to spectra with mean S/N approaching\nunity, albeit with large errors. Systematic errors should\nbe negligible for velocity measurements at all S/N , and\nthey should be . 20% in \u03c3obs at S/N & 2; systematic errors are always smaller than the calculated random error\n(Paper III).\n2.4.4. Instrumental-broadening Corrections\nWe correct our observed stellar kinematics for the system response function by considering the following two\nseparable components: (1) The broadening of the intrinsic absorption-line widths due to the spectrograph optics, accounted for using an \"instrumental-broadening\"\ncorrection, \u03b4\u03c3inst ; and (2) The smearing of the intrinsic\nsurface-brightness, velocity, and velocity dispersion distributions by the response of the atmosphere+telescope\nsystem, accounted for using a \"beam-smearing\" correc2\n\u2212\ntion, \u03c3beam . The final LOS dispersion is \u03c3\u22172 = \u03c3obs\n2\n2\n\u03b4\u03c3inst \u2212 \u03c3beam (Paper II). Unlike \u03c3beam , \u03b4\u03c3inst is independent of the on-sky geometry and intrinsic kinematic\nstructure of the observed galaxy; therefore, we calculate\n\u03b4\u03c3inst here. We calculate \u03c3beam before combining our\nSparsePak and PPak kinematics in Section 4 using the\nprojection geometry derived in Section 3.\nEach CC is used to compare template and galaxy\nabsorption-line shapes such that \u03b4\u03c3inst is determined by\nthe difference in \u03c3inst measured for the template and\ngalaxy spectrum; we calculate \u03b4\u03c3inst following Appendix\nA of Paper III using our measurements of \u03c3inst for both\nthe template and galaxy spectra. We adopt a 4% error\nin \u03b4\u03c3inst (Paper II), which is marginal when compared\nto \u01eb(\u03c3obs ). These corrections differ rather dramatically\nbetween SparsePak and PPak; however, in both cases,\n2\n\u03b4\u03c3inst\nis typically small. Corrections to \u03c3obs - i.e., the\n1\n2\n2\nratio (\u03c3obs\n\u2212\u03b4\u03c3inst\n) 2 /\u03c3obs - are . 4% and . 20% for, respectively, 90% and 99% of all measurements; a few measurements have rather large corrections due to dispersion\nmeasurements of \u03c3obs < 10 km s\u22121 , which are likely erroneously low (Paper III). We always find \u03b4\u03c3inst < \u01eb(\u03c3inst ).\n2.5. Atomic-Gas Content\nAs part of our general survey strategy (Paper I), we\nhave obtained 21cm aperture-synthesis imaging for the\nDMS Phase-B sample. These data measure neutral hydrogen (H i) surface densities (\u03a3Hi ) and extend the\nrotation-curve measurements of each galaxy; the ionizedgas kinematics can be limited by the FOV of our H\u03b1\nspectroscopy and/or the extent of the H\u03b1 emission in\nthe disk. For UGC 463, we obtained 2.3 hours of onsource integration using the Very Large Array (VLA);\nobservations were taken in the C configuration yielding\na synthesized beam of 14.\u2032\u2032 7 \u00d7 12.\u2032\u2032 9 and a velocity resolution of 10.5 km s\u22121 . In the end, these data provide\nonly a marginal radial extension of the ionized-gas rotation curve of UGC 463. The acquisition and reduction\nof these data is fully described by Martinsson (2011).\nThe two-dimensional H i mass-surface-density map and\n\n\fThe DiskMass Survey.

Errors (random in black and systematic in gray) shown for \u03a3H2 and \u03a3gas are discussed in the text;\nerrors in \u03a3Hi are of order the size of the plotted symbol.

The azimuthally\naveraged measurements of \u03a3Hi (R) for UGC 463 are presented in Figure 4; we adopt \u01eb(\u03a3Hi ) = 0.1\u03a3Hi . As is\ntypical of late-type spiral galaxies we find a decrease in\nthe H i mass surface density toward the galaxy center;\nthe peak surface density of \u03a3Hi = 5.6 M\u2299 pc\u22122 occurs\nat R = 1.9hR . Although the spatial resolution of our\nH i column-density map is a factor of & 3 larger than\nour optical IFU data, we do not attempt to match the\nresolution of these two data sets; such a correction to\nthe azimuthally averaged total mass surface density is\nnegligible for the purposes of this paper.\n2.6. Molecular-Gas Content\nOur nominal survey scope does not include direct observations of the molecular content of our galaxy sample via, e.g., the 12 CO (J = 1 \u2192 0) emission line -\nhenceforth all discussion of \"CO emission\" refers to this\nemission feature unless noted otherwise. Until we obtain such data, estimation of the molecular content in\nDMS galaxies relies on available literature data and/or\ninference from other suitable tracers for which data is\navailable.\nFor our characterization of the molecular content of\nUGC 463, we use our 24\u03bcm Spitzer imaging to produce\na rough approximation of the CO surface-brightness distribution. Numerous studies exist demonstrating a correlation between the infrared luminosity of star-forming\ngalaxies (dominated by thermal dust emission) and their\nmolecular-gas content as traced by CO emission. For\nexample, the integrated infrared luminosity based on\n\nIRAS observations17 is well-correlated with the integrated CO flux (Young & Scoville 1991). Moreover,\nBendo et al. (2007) note a similar dependence of the\ndistribution of 24\u03bcm emission on morphological type\nas was noted by Young et al. (1995) for the molecular gas traced by CO emission. At spatially resolved\nscales, Paladino et al. (2006) have studied the correlation between CO (ICO \u2206V ) and 24\u03bcm emission (I24\u03bcm )\nin a set of 6 nearby spiral galaxies to find I24\u03bcm \u221d\n(ICO \u2206V )0.9\u00b10.1 . Correlations between the CO and 8\u03bcm\nemission have also been discussed (Regan et al. 2006;\nBendo et al. 2010); however, we prefer to focus on the\ncorrelation between ICO \u2206V and I24\u03bcm as the latter\nshould be dominated by warm dust emission and be\nless dependent on the fraction of dust in the form of\npolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (see, e.g., Draine & Li\n2007).\nIn Section 2.6.1, we describe the procedure used\nto measure I24\u03bcm (R) in UGC 463. In Section 2.6.2,\nwe detail the calibration of our I24\u03bcm -to-ICO \u2206V\nsurface-brightness relation using data made available\nby Leroy et al. (2008, hereafter L08). Finally, in Section 2.6.3, we convert from I24\u03bcm to ICO \u2206V and then\ncalculate the molecular mass surface density, \u03a3H2 , using\nthe traditional X-factor, XCO . This latter step dominates the systematic error in our estimation of the molecular content of UGC 463.\n2.6.1. 24\u03bcm Spitzer Photometry\nThe survey strategy for all our Spitzer observations are\nprovided in Section 6.2.3 of Paper I. In general, 24\u03bcm\nimages collected for the DMS demonstrate significant\nbackground structure, due to both detector effects and\nintrinsic structure in the Galactic ISM, with fluctuations\non angular scales close to that of our galaxies. To account for these fluctuations, we mask out all statistically\nsignificant sources, including a substantial radial region\nsurrounding UGC 463, and create a 47\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 47\u2032\u2032 boxcarsmoothed background image. Masked regions are iteratively filled by the boxcar smoothing, effectively interpolating the sky background and its gross structure, across\nall detected sources. We simply subtract this smoothed\nimage from our 24\u03bcm image of UGC 463 and use the\nresult to calculate the 24\u03bcm surface-brightness profile.\nOur background-subtraction procedure has been carefully assessed to ensure that the low-surface-brightness\nextent of UGC 463 has not been systematically oversubtracted. Preliminary tests with UGC 463 and other\ngalaxies in our survey demonstrate that our I24\u03bcm profiles become strongly affected by the sky-subtraction errors at a source intensity below I24\u03bcm < 0.05 MJy sr\u22121\n17\n\nhttp://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/IRASdocs/iras.html\n\n\f10\n\nWestfall et al.\n\n(\u03a3H2 < 0.21 M\u2299 pc\u22122 in Figure 4). UGC 463 is the\nthird brightest 24\u03bcm emitter in our entire sample, meaning that this surface brightness limit falls outside the radial region relevant to this paper. Our measured 24\u03bcm\nsurface-brightness profile uses elliptical apertures following a geometry identical to that used for the optical and\nNIR photometry in Section 2.2.1. Figure 4 provides the\n24\u03bcm surface-brightness profile and the result of its conversion to \u03a3H2 , according to the discussion in the next\ntwo sections. The random errors in our I24\u03bcm measurements incorporate a constant 4% calibration error\n(Engelbracht et al. 2007) and a sky-subtraction error estimated by the change in I24\u03bcm introduced by a factor of\ntwo change in the smoothing-box size; the latter results\nin 1% and 10% sky-subtraction errors at R \u223c 30\u2032\u2032 and\n\u223c 47\u2032\u2032 , respectively.\n2.6.2. 24\u03bcm-to-CO Surface Brightness Calibration\nWe use measurements of both CO and 24\u03bcm emission\nprovided by L08 (see their Table 7) to measure the correlation between I24\u03bcm and ICO \u2206V . Twelve of the 23\ngalaxies studied by L08 include both CO and 24\u03bcm observations; however, four of those galaxies (NGC 2841,\nNGC 3627, NGC 4736, and NGC 5194) are listed in\nNED as having either LINER or Seyfert activity, unlike UGC 463. Therefore, we calibrate I24\u03bcm /ICO \u2206V\nusing only the remaining eight galaxies, hereafter the\n\"I24\u03bcm /ICO \u2206V subsample.\"\nThe quantities provided by L08 are matchedresolution, azimuthally averaged radial profiles of \u03a3H2\n(based on CO emission and a value for XCO ) and the\ncontribution of embedded star formation (determined\nfrom the 24\u03bcm surface brightness) to the total starformation-rate surface density. We revert these quantities to ICO \u2206V (in K km s\u22121 ) and I24\u03bcm (in MJy sr\u22121 )\nusing equations A2 and D1 from L08. All eight galaxies\nin the I24\u03bcm /ICO \u2206V subsample were observed as part\nof the HERACLES Survey (Leroy et al. 2009), observing only the 12 CO(J = 2 \u2192 1) emission line, where L08\nadopt a line ratio of 12 CO(J = 2 \u2192 1)/12 CO(J = 1 \u2192 0)\n= 0.8. The CO surface brightness has been determined\nby integrating the emission profile over the full line width\nand converting the flux units per beam to Kelvin using\nthe Rayleigh-Jeans limit. The 24\u03bcm fluxes are determined from surface photometry of Spitzer imaging data\nobtained by the SINGS Survey (Kennicutt et al. 2003).\nFigure 5 presents the data for the I24\u03bcm /ICO \u2206V subsample regardless of the galaxy or radial region from\nwhich it has been measured. Table 7 from L08 is used\nto calculate \u01eb(ICO \u2206V ) directly, whereas we adopt a uniform \u01eb(I24\u03bcm ) = 0.15I24\u03bcm due to insufficient information; we expect this \u01eb(I24\u03bcm ) to be an upper limit. We\nfit a power-law relationship between I24\u03bcm and ICO \u2206V\nto all available data, incorporating errors in both coordinates (Section 15.3 of Press et al. 2007), finding a best\nfit of\n\u0015 \u0012\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0013\n\u0014\nI24\u03bcm\nICO \u2206V\n=\n1.08\nlog\n+\n0.15\n,\nlog\nK km s\u22121\nMJy sr\u22121\n(1)\nwith a weighted standard deviation of \u00b10.11 dex, in good\nagreement with the previous result from Paladino et al.\n(2006). Thus, given that UGC 463 has physical parameters that are comparable to the I24\u03bcm /ICO \u2206V subsam-\n\nFigure 5.

The dotted line has the slope determined by Paladino et al. (2006) using a different galaxy sample\nwith different CO data. The arrow at the top of the plot indicates\nthe peak I24\u03bcm measured for UGC 463.\n\nple, our calibration is expected to estimate ICO \u2206V for\nthis galaxy to within \u223c 30%.\n2.6.3. H2 Mass Surface Density\nUsing equation 1, we convert our sky-subtracted 24\u03bcm\nimage of UGC 463 to a CO surface brightness map. Subsequently, we calculate the H2 mass surface density using\nthe traditional conversion factor, XCO , following\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\nICO \u2206V\n\u03a3 H2\n=\n1.6\n\u00d7\nM\u2299 pc\u22122\nK km s\u22121\n\u0014\n\u0015\nXCO\ncos i, (2)\n1020 cm\u22122 (K km s\u22121 )\u22121\nwhere i is the galaxy inclination and XCO is the ratio of\nthe H2 column density to the CO line strength. This use\nof XCO to calculate \u03a3H2 is a common procedure for calculating the molecular-gas content of external galaxies;\nhowever, it may suffer from substantial systematic error.\nA large number of studies have been devoted to measuring XCO both in our own Galaxy and within the\nLocal Group. Empirical and theoretical studies suggest XCO likely depends on multiple physical parameters, such as metallicity, radiation field, gas mass surface density, and density structure (Arimoto et al. 1996;\nMihos et al. 1999; Boselli et al. 2002; Bell et al. 2006;\nNarayanan et al. 2011). Moreover, direct measurement\nof XCO is observationally challenging: For example,\nthe assumption of virial equilibrium and the finite spatial resolution of giant molecular clouds, in even Local\nGroup galaxies, may both lead to inflated values of XCO\n(Blitz et al. 2007; Bolatto et al. 2008); see Bolatto et al.\n(2008) for a more general review of XCO measurements.\nKeeping these complications in mind, our analysis here\nadopts a simple approach: Combining the Galactic measurement of XCO = 1.8 \u00b1 0.3 from Dame et al. (2001)\nwith the measurements for M31 (XCO = 3.6 \u00b1 0.3) and\nM33 (XCO = 2.6 \u00b1 0.4) from Bolatto et al. (2008), we\nfind a mean and range of XCO = (2.7 \u00b1 0.9) \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122\n\n\fThe DiskMass Survey. IV.\n(K kms\u22121 )\u22121 . We assume this value to be representative\nof UGC 463, given that the Milky Way, M31 and M33 are\narguably the only spiral galaxies with well-resolved observations of giant molecular clouds or associations from\nwhich robust measurements of XCO can be made.\nFigure 1 provides the 24\u03bcm image, converted to \u03a3H2\nin units of M\u2299 pc\u22122 using the I24\u03bcm /ICO \u2206V calibration from Section 2.6.2 and assuming XCO = 2.7 \u00d7 1020\ncm\u22122 (K km s\u22121 )\u22121 . Figure 4 provides the azimuthally\naveraged surface density profile \u03a3H2 (R) using the 24\u03bcm\nsurface-brightness profile from Section 2.6.1. Errors in\n\u03a3H2 are plotted separately for random and systematic\ncomponents; the former includes errors from the I24\u03bcm\ncalibration and photometry and the inclination, whereas\nthe latter includes the I24\u03bcm /ICO \u2206V calibration error\nand range in XCO . This estimate of \u03a3H2 (R) agrees\nwith the expectation that H2 is concentrated toward the\n\"hole\" in the H i mass surface density, also seen in Figure\n1 and studies of other galaxies (e.g., L08).\nOut to 15 kpc (4.2 hR ), we find MH2 /MH i = 3.2, a\nvalue that is reasonable with respect to direct CO and H i\nstudies in the literature. In particular, Young & Knezek\n(1989) find a range of 0.2 and 4.0 for, respectively,\nlate- and early-type spiral galaxies, comparable to the\nrange measured by the more recent COLD GASS survey (Saintonge et al. 2011). However, despite having\na total MH2 /MH i that is decreased by \u223c 10% compared to the measurement within 15 kpc (Martinsson\n2011), UGC 463 is more rich in molecular gas than the\nmean MH2 /MH i calculated by Saintonge et al. (2011)\nfor the COLD GASS survey by approximately twice\nthe standard deviation. Similarly, by combining our\n24\u03bcm imaging, the I24\u03bcm /ICO \u2206V and XCO values derived herein, and the H i data presented by Martinsson\n(2011) for 24 galaxies in the DMS, we find a mean of\nMH2 /MH i = 0.48, consistent with the Saintonge et al.\n(2011) measurement after accounting for the difference in\ntheir adopted XCO ; UGC 463 has the maximum value of\nMH2 /MH i and 21 of 24 galaxies have MH2 /MH i < 1.\nTherefore, consideration of the molecular mass component in UGC 463 is relatively more important to our dynamical \u03a5\u2217 measurements and the baryonic mass budget\nthan the majority of galaxies in the DMS. In Section 5.6,\nwe discuss both the total dynamical mass-to-light ratios\nas well as stellar-mass-only measurements to illustrate\nthe effects of the gas-mass corrections.\n2.7. Total Gas Content\nFigure 4 provides a calculation of the total gas content\nof UGC 463, \u03a3gas = 1.4(\u03a3Hi + \u03a3H2 ); the factor of 1.4\naccounts for the helium and metal fraction. For this calculation, measurements of \u03a3H2 have been interpolated\nto the radii of the \u03a3Hi measurements; different interpolation schemes are used in subsequent sections. The\nrandom and systematic error have been separated as discussed above for \u03a3H2 . Figure 4 demonstrates a strong\ncorrespondence between \u03bc\u2032K and \u03a3gas . Therefore, if \u03bc\u2032K\nis a reasonable tracer of the stellar mass, the correspondence in Figure 4 suggests that the radial distribution of\nthe stellar mass is roughly equivalent to that of the total\ngas mass.\n\n11\n\n3. ON-SKY GEOMETRIC PROJECTION\nGeometric projection parameters are a fundamental\nconsideration for the DMS. In particular, accurate inclinations are required to decompose \u03c3\u2217 into the vertical\ncomponent, \u03c3z , using the measured axial ratios of the\nSVE (Section 5.2), and to produce the deprojected rotation curve, Vrot (R), used in our mass decomposition. Errors in \u03c3z and Vrot have opposite trends with inclination\nsuch that intermediate inclinations (25\u25e6 \u2264 i \u2264 35\u25e6 ) are\npreferred and, therefore, used to select optimal galaxies\nfor our survey (Papers I and II).\nWe present a detailed discussion of our determination\nof the geometric projection of UGC 463 below. We determine the inclination in Section 3.1; we measure the\non-sky pointing of each observation in Section 3.2; and,\nin Section 3.3, we discuss the two-dimensional maps presented in Figure 1 created using our final pointing geometry.\n\n3.1. Inclination\nWe measure inclination using two methods: (1) \"kinematic inclinations\" (ikin ) are determined by modeling\nan observed velocity field by a circularly rotating disk\nand (2) \"inverse-Tully\u2013Fisher inclinations\" (iTF ) are determined by inverting the TF relation (Rix & Zaritsky\n1995). Kinematic measurements are used in both inclination estimates, but in different ways: For iTF , one\nmeasures a fiducial velocity from the rotation curve\n(e.g., Vmax or Vflat ; V01) in projection and compares\nwith the inclination-corrected rotation speed predicted\nby the TF relation for a known absolute magnitude. In\ncontradistinction, ikin measurements are independent of\nany distance or photometric measurement, instead determined by minimizing the difference between measured\nand model isovelocity contours.\nWe demonstrated in Paper II that the combination of\nikin and iTF is ideal for minimizing the errors at low (using iTF ) and high (using ikin ) inclination; the two methods produce roughly equivalent errors at i \u223c 30\u25e6 . A comparison of ikin and iTF allows for an internal assessment\nof the accuracy and precision of each. We present measurements of ikin and iTF for UGC 463 below, and find\nthat the measurements are consistent at 1.2 times the\ncombined error, which is satisfactory for our purposes.\nA statistically rigorous combination of the two inclination estimates is derived by Andersen & Bershady, in\nprep; however, here we simply produce the error-weighted\nmean value i = 27\u25e6 \u00b1 2\u25e6 , which is used in our analysis\nin Section 3.2 and thereafter. One can also estimate inclination via eccentricity measurements of isophotal contours; however, this method is particularly poor at low\ninclination and for galaxies that have significant outerdisk spiral structure, as is true of UGC 463 (Figure 1).\nNevertheless, we calculate a mean isophotal inclination\nof 27\u25e6 \u00b1 3\u25e6 by combining Source-Extractor eccentricity\nmeasurements in the SDSS g, r, and i bands and the\n2MASS J, H, and K bands; this photometric measurement is easily consistent with our adopted inclination\nbased on kinematic measurements.\n3.1.1. Kinematic Inclination\nWe use the method described in Andersen et al.\n(2008) to measure kinematic inclinations; see also\n\n\f12\n\nWestfall et al.\n\nAndersen & Bershady (2003). The strength of this\nmethod is in its simultaneous use of the full twodimensional information in our observed velocity fields.\nHowever, it assumes a single set of geometric projection\nparameters for the entire disk (a \"one-zone\" model), assumes that all motion is purely circular rotation in the\ndisk plane, and adopts a parameterization for the projected rotation curve; therefore, one must justify these\nassumptions.\nBased on edge-on galaxies, literature studies have repeatedly found that warps in non-interacting galaxies\nonly influence disk morphology at large radii. Highlighting two recent studies, van der Kruit (2007) have shown\nthat gas disks (as traced by HI) typically begin to warp at\napproximately the outer truncation radius of the stellar\ndisk and Saha et al. (2009) have shown that stellar-disk\nwarps occur at R > 3hR . Thus, we expect no warping within the FOV of our IFS of UGC 463, and only a\nmarginal warping of our HI data. Indeed, our H i data\nonly begin to show a position-angle warp for the last\nmeasured radial bin (R = 45\u2032\u2032 ; Martinsson 2011). For\nour IFU data, post-analysis of the velocity-field residuals demonstrates little to no radial dependence of the\ngeometric parameters, as determined by translating velocity residuals with respect to our nominal model (as\ndeveloped in this and subsequent sections) into modelparameter residuals. This is done by holding all but one\nparameter fixed and adjusting the free parameter until\nthe velocity residual is nearly or identically zero. We find\nno correlation between the parameter residuals and radius, with the possible exception of the position angle.\nThere is some indication of a positive slope in position\nangle with radius; however, the magnitude of the position angle change is small (less than 5\u25e6 over the full radial\nrange) and the significance of the slope is marginal. This\nmeans that the use of a radially dependent position angle\nis only marginally justified and, more importantly, inconsequential to our measurement of the rotation curve.\nTherefore, a one-zone velocity-field model provides an\nadequate description of our optical kinematic data.\nAs briefly noted in Section 3.3, the isovelocity contours in our velocity fields appear to show slight noncircular motions. These motions are most prevalent for\nthe H\u03b1 data where some coherent structure is seen in\nthe velocity-field residual map, particularly along the\nspiral-arm to the south-west of the galaxy center (on the\napproaching side of the velocity field). These coherent\nresiduals likely represent streaming motions along this\nspiral arm toward the galaxy center given their spatial\ncorrelation to the photometric feature and the sign of the\nresidual. The magnitude of this streaming is less than 10\nkm s\u22121 along the LOS (less than 25 km s\u22121 in the disk\nplane) and the covering fraction of all non-circular motions is small. Therefore, we expect that our best-fitting\nvelocity-field model should suffer only marginally from\nthese motions, particularly given the benefits afforded\nthe one-zone model in this respect.\nproj\nThe parameterization of Vrot\n(R) = Vrot (R) sin i does\nnot adversely bias the derived geometric parameters:\nAndersen & Bershady (2003) and Andersen et al. (2008)\nhave chosen a hyperbolic tangent (tanh) function - a\nsimple two-parameter model that enforces an asymptotically flat rotation curve. Although inappropriate for the\n\nTable 4\nKinematic Geometry\n\nData Set\nH\u03b1\n[O iii]\nStars\nHi\nMean\n\nikin\n(deg)\n\n\u03c60\n(deg)\n\nVsys\n(km s\u22121 )\n\n24.1+4.5\n\u22122.1\n26.5+4.6\n\u22123.9\n+4.7\n25.5\u221210.8\n***\n25.1 \u00b1 2.5\n\n68.8+0.3\n\u22120.3\n68.8+0.4\n\u22120.7\n68.4+0.6\n\u22120.7\n68.8 \u00b1 1.5\n68.8 \u00b1 0.3\n\n4458.6+1.0\n\u22120.5\n4460.4+0.6\n\u22120.8\n4461.3+0.6\n\u22120.8\n4459.5 \u00b1 1.5\n4460 \u00b1 1\n\nrare declining rotation curve in the DMS sample, kinematic inclinations derived for such galaxies using a more\nappropriate parameterization (e.g., Courteau 1997) are\nwithin the formal errors of those derived using a tanh\nmodel.\nGiven our highly sampled and high-quality velocity\nfields of UGC 463, here we use a step function to deproj\nfine Vrot\n(R), effectively fitting a set of co-planar \"rings\"\nwith constant rotation speed. We fit up to 13 rings, each\nwith a width of 3\u2032\u2032 (approximately the diameter of a single PPak fiber) such that rotation-speed gradients within\neach ring are small, except for possibly the central ring.\nThe final ring includes all data at R > 36\u2032\u2032 and may be\nomitted for some tracers if no data exist at these radii.\nDespite our use of the term \"ring\" here, we emphasize\nthat this fit is not a typical tilted-ring fit given that we\nare defining only a single set of geometric parameters.\nWe measure independent kinematic inclinations for the\nthree kinematic data sets provided by the SparsePak H\u03b1\ndata and the PPak [O iii] and stellar data. All geometric and rotation-curve parameters are fit simultaneously,\nwith one exception: Martinsson (2011) has used reconstructed continuum images to determine the morphological center of UGC 463 relative to the PPak fibers,\nto which we affix the dynamical center when modeling\nthese data. Greater detail regarding our velocity-field\nfitting approach is provided in Appendix B, including a\nfull description of which measurements are omitted from\nconsideration during the fit. However, Appendix B is\nprimarily focused toward an assessment of the optimal\ndata-weighting scheme for modeling the velocity field of\nUGC 463. Therein, we use bootstrap simulations (see\nSection 15.6.2 of Press et al. 2007) to produce inclination\nprobability distributions based on four different weighting schemes. We thereby demonstrate that we obtain the\nmost correspondent inclinations among the different data\nsets by adopting weights defined by the derivative of the\nmodel LOS velocity, VLOS , with respect to the inclination, i.e. \u2202VLOS /\u2202i. These weights approximately follow\na sin2 (2\u03b8) function in azimuth and a direct proportionality in radius; therefore, data with the most leverage on\nthe fitted inclination (at approximately \u00b145\u25e6 from the\nmajor axis; Andersen & Bershady 2003) have the highest weight. The best-fitting inclination, position angle,\nand systemic velocity for each tracer are given in Table 4;\nbootstrap simulations are used to calculate the 68% confidence intervals. The results provided for our H i data\nfrom Martinsson (2011) are based on traditional tiltedring fitting (Begeman 1989).\nThe geometric parameters listed in Table 4 for each\ndynamical tracer are in general agreement; the systemic\n\n\fThe DiskMass Survey.

Such differences are likely due to systematic errors in the heliocentric velocities of the template stars\nand/or shifts in the pointing center. In any case, these\nshifts are small and irrelevant to our analysis of the\nmass distribution in UGC 463. Using the half width\nof the 68% confidence interval from Table 4 as the error,\nwe calculate error-weighted means of ikin = 25.\u25e6 1 \u00b1 2.\u25e6 5\nand \u03c60 = 68.\u25e6 8 \u00b1 0.\u25e6 3. The unweighted mean value\nVsys = 4460 \u00b1 1 km s\u22121 has been used in Section 2.1\nto calculate the distance to UGC 463.\n3.1.2. Inverse Tully\u2013Fisher Inclination\nFollowing the discussion in Paper II, inverse-TF inclinations are calculated according to\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0012\nc1,\u03bb \u2212 M\u03bb\nproj\n\u22121\n,\n(3)\n2Vrot dlog\niTF = sin\nc2,\u03bb\nwhere c1,\u03bb and c2,\u03bb are, respectively, the zero-point and\nslope of the TF relation in wavelength band \u03bb and\nM\u03bb is the total absolute magnitude. Combining D =\n59.67 \u00b1 4.15 Mpc (the error here is the quadrature sum\nof the random and systematic error from Section 2.1),\nmK = 9.32 \u00b1 0.02 (Section 2.2.3), and a K-correction of\n0.035 mag (Bershady 1995), we find MK = \u221224.59\u00b10.15\nfor UGC 463. We use the K-band TF relations derived\nby V01 to calculate iTF based on measurements of the\nprojected rotation speed.\nWe measure the projected rotation-curve for all gas\ntracers in UGC 463 for use in calculating iTF ; stellar\nmeasurements are not considered due to significant asymproj\nmetric drift (Section 4.3). Figure 6 presents Vrot\nfor\nthe H\u03b1 and [O iii] data resulting from all four weighting\nschemes implemented in Appendix B; H i measurements\nare directly from Martinsson (2011).

The H\u03b1 data, in particular, appear to asymptote\nat R > 24\u2032\u2032 ; hence this radial region is chosen for meaproj\nproj\nsuring hVrot\ni. Table 5 provides hVrot\ni for each tracer;\nproj\nmeasurements of hVrot i from H\u03b1 and [O iii] are the unweighted mean of the results from all weighting schemes.\nUsing all tracers, we find a mean and standard deviation\nproj\nof hVrot\ni = 107 \u00b1 2 km s\u22121 .\n\n13\n\nThe calculation of iTF and its uncertainty relies on\ntwo additional factors: (1) the choice of the TF relation and (2) the estimation of its intrinsic scatter. V01\ncreated multiple samples based on a rotation-curve- and\nasymmetry-based taxonomy, each sample yielding different TF coefficients (c1,\u03bb and c2,\u03bb ) and intrinsic-scatter\nestimates. UGC 463 exhibits H i and ionized-gas properties that are most consistent with the \"RC/F D\" sample\nfrom V01 (see his Sections 4 and 5 for a detailed definition of this sample); UGC 463 fits within the definition of the \"RC/F D\" sample because its rotation curve\nasymptotes to a nearly constant rotation speed and exhibits neither strong rotation asymmetries (Section 4.2)\nnor signs of ongoing interaction. Additionally, V01 produced TF coefficients based on two fiducial velocities,\none measured at the rotation-curve peak (Vmax ) and the\nother where it \"flattened\" to a constant value (Vflat ).\nUGC 463 exhibits a well-defined Vflat (Figure 6); however, in most cases Vflat = Vmax for galaxies studied by\nV01. The smallest observed scatter in the K-band TF\nrelations derived by V01 (0.26 mag) was found by excluding the outlying NGC 3992 measurements from the\n\"RC/F D\" sample (leaving measurements for 21 galaxies) and using Vflat for the fiducial rotation measurement;\nthis TF relation is consistent with having zero intrinsic\nscatter.\nGiven the range in c1,K and c2,K for the \"RC/F D\"\nsample (with and without NGC 3992 and based on either Vmax or Vflat ) from Table 4 of V01, we find 28\u25e6 \u2264\niTF \u2264 30\u25e6 ; and we find \u01eb(iTF ) = 1\u25e6 and 2\u25e6 assuming,\nrespectively, 0.0 and 0.2 magnitudes of intrinsic TF scatter, regardless of the assumed c1,K and c2,K . Taking a\nmean across the four relevant TF relations and assuming\n0.2 magnitudes for the intrinsic TF scatter, we measure\niTF = 29\u25e6 \u00b1 2\u25e6 for UGC 463; this measurement of iTF is\ndominated by systematic error with roughly equal contributions from the uncertainties in H0 and the TF relation.\nOur conservative approach to measuring iTF is justified\ngiven that, at MK = \u221224.59 \u00b1 0.15, UGC 463 is more\nluminous than any galaxy considered by V01, far away\nfrom the \"pivot\" point of the fitted K-band TF relations\n(MK \u223c \u221222).\n3.2. Position Angle and Dynamical Center\nThe kinematic position angles derived in Section 3.1.1\nare very consistent among all dynamical tracers; Table\n4 provides an error-weighted mean value of \u03c60 = 68.8 \u00b1\n0.3, which is constant across the optical disk to good\napproximation (as discussed in Section 3.1.1). As stated\nabove, the PPak data affix the dynamical center to the\nmorphological center.\nWe determine the pointing of each SparsePak IFU observation relative to the dynamical center by fitting the\nkinematic geometry (as in Section 3.1.1) with i and \u03c60\nfixed. We simultaneously fit all kinematics measured\nfrom our IFS, assuming all tracers are in co-planar rotation. To do so, we apply slight offsets to Vsys according\nto the differences found in Table 4 such that all data\ncan be forced to have the Vsys measured for the stars.\nWe also allow for asymmetric drift between the gas and\nstars by simultaneously fitting different rotation curves\nto these components. Finally, we force the [O iii] and\nstellar kinematics determined from the SparsePak observations to have the same pointing center. During the\n\n\f14\n\nWestfall et al.\n\nFigure 6.

Two-Dimensional Maps\nFive of the nine images in Figure 1 have used an interpolation algorithm to smooth over the interstitial regions\nof our IFS. The continuum surface-brightness maps of\nour IFS (labeled \u03bcH\u03b1 and \u03bcMg i ) are determined via a\ncalibration to SDSS imaging data. The detailed procedures used to both perform the surface-brightness calibration and two-dimensional interpolation are discussed\nin Appendix A. These interpolated kinematic maps are\npurely for illustration purposes, useful for qualitative assessments of our registration of the dynamical center and\na discussion of the two-dimensional kinematic morphology; however, all quantitative analyses herein have been\nperformed using the direct fiber measurements, the IFU\nastrometric tables, and our derived pointings.\nThe first column of Figure 1 demonstrates the excellent agreement among the reconstructed continuum images and the direct SDSS g-band image.

We further explore the kinematic axisymmetry\nin Section 4.2.\n4. AZIMUTHALLY AVERAGED KINEMATICS\nAnalyses in Sections 5 and 6 assume UGC 463 is axially symmetric, considering only the azimuthally averaged kinematics that we derive in the following subsections. We apply beam-smearing corrections in Section 4.1 (beam-smearing corrections for the H i data are\ndescribed by Martinsson 2011) such that kinematic data\nfrom different instruments can be combined. In Section 4.2, we assess the degree of dynamical symmetry\nby comparing approaching- and receding-side kinematics. Finding no substantial asymmetries, we discuss the\nazimuthally averaged kinematics in Section 4.3.\n\n4.1. Beam-Smearing Corrections\nOur beam-smearing corrections require a characterization of the beam profile, the convolution of the pointspread function and the fiber aperture. Since no significant jitter was detected among or during the individual IFS observations, the effective fiber aperture is\ngiven by the plate-scale (yielding 2.\u2032\u2032 7 for PPak and 4.\u2032\u2032 7\nfor SparsePak). In Appendix A, we find that the seeing of the SDSS imaging data - 1.\u2032\u2032 5 in g-band and 1.\u2032\u2032 2\nin r-band - is very close to the effective seeing of our\nSparsePak IFS; Martinsson (2011) provides a direct seeing measurement of 1.\u2032\u2032 7 for our PPak IFS. Our beamsmearing corrections change negligibly over the range of\nmeasured seeing; therefore, we simply adopt 1.\u2032\u2032 5 seeing\nto calculate all beam-smearing corrections.\nOur approach to beam-smearing corrections (Paper II)\ndepends on comparing our UGC 463 data to models of the intrinsic surface-brightness (I), velocity (V ),\nand velocity-dispersion (\u03c3) distributions. SDSS imaging data provide the model surface-brightness distribution; g-band data are used for Mg i-region IFS\nand r-band are used for H\u03b1-region IFS. We assume\na polyex parameterization to model the intrinsic rotation curve (Giovanelli & Haynes 2002). The gas velocity dispersion is assumed to be constant with radius\nand isotropic. Only the H\u03b1 data are used to describe\nthe velocity-dispersion profile; beam-smearing corrections are marginally different if the [O iii] dispersions are\nused instead. For the stars, we adopt SVE axial ratios of\n\u03b1 = \u03c3z /\u03c3R = 0.6 and \u03b2 = \u03c3\u03b8 /\u03c3R as determined by the\nepicycle approximation (Section 5.2; equation 5). The\nmodel radial profile for the azimuthally averaged \u03c3\u2217 (\u03c3\u2217 )\ncombines an exponential function with a cubic Legendrepolynomial perturbation at small radius; although somewhat ad hoc, this form allows for deviations from a nominal exponential while enforcing a well-behaved, exponential form at large radius. For UGC 463, deviations of \u03c3\u2217\nfrom an exponential form are small and irrelevant to the\ncalculated beam-smearing corrections.\nBeam-smearing corrections are calculated as follows:\nA fit to the uncorrected data is used to generate a seed\nmodel of the intrinsic galaxy kinematics, which is then\n\"observed\" by integrating a set of Gaussian line profiles, defined by (I, V, \u03c3), discretely sampled over the\n\n15\n\nbeam profile of each fiber to create a synthetic data set\n(Westfall 2009). The velocity and velocity-dispersion\ncorrections are the difference between this synthetic\ndataset and the model value at the center of the fiber,\nand they are primarily correlated with the velocity gradients across the fiber face. The beam-smearing effects\nare largest toward the galaxy center where the rotation\ncurve is most steeply rising and the azimuthal coverage\nof each fiber is largest. The trend of the correction is to\nincrease the measured rotation speed and decrease the\nmeasured velocity dispersion. We converge to a set of\nbeam-smearing corrections iteratively by updating the\nmodel of the intrinsic galaxy kinematics, done by fitting\nthe corrected observational data, and minimizing the difference between the observed and synthetic data sets.\nMonte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the random\nerrors in the beam-smearing corrections are . 10%; systematic errors, estimated by calculating beam-smearing\ncorrections using SVE-shape extrema, are typically much\nsmaller. Therefore, we adopt the quadrature sum of a\n10% random error and the estimated systematic error for\neach fiber as the error in the beam-smearing correction;\nthe error is always 10% for the gas data. Although lower\nthan the upper-limit used in Paper II, this reduction in\nerror has little effect on the error budget.\nThe correspondence of the uncorrected H\u03b1, [O iii], and\nH i rotation curves in Figure 6, despite the factor of & 3\ndifference in the beam size among the data sets, suggests\nbeam-smearing corrections should be small; this expectation is in agreement with our direct beam-smearing calculations. For the ionized gas data, corrections to VLOS\nare less than 2 km s\u22121 for 93% of the data, with a maximum correction of 14 km s\u22121 . For the stellar data, VLOS\ncorrections are less than 2 km s\u22121 for 84% and 99% of\nthe SparsePak and PPak data, respectively; the maximum correction is 7 km s\u22121 for SparsePak and 8 km s\u22121\nfor PPak. Corrections to \u03c3\u2217 are less than 5% for 91% and\n99% of the SparsePak and PPak data, respectively; the\nmaximum correction is 41% for SparsePak and 29% for\nPPak. Corrections to \u03c3\u2217 are typically less than \u01eb(\u03c3obs ),\nwith the only exceptions occurring near the galaxy center.\n4.2. Axial Symmetry\nFigure 7 presents individual-fiber kinematics after correcting for instrumental-broadening and beam-smearing,\nwith point types indicating the tracer and instrument.\nFor measurements located at in-plane azimuths within\nproj\n\u00b160\u25e6 of the major axis, we deproject VLOS to Vrot\n;\nrotation velocities are plotted regardless of whether or\nnot they were rejected from the velocity-field fitting discussed in Section 3. Velocity-dispersion data include all\nmeasurements made at any azimuth. We find the kinematic measurements from the different IFUs to be very\nwell matched. Data are separated according to the approaching (negative radii) and receding sides. Figure 7\nalso overlays mean quantities from either side of the miproj\nfor the ionized gas and\nnor axis.

The diagonal dashed line in the \u03c3gas panel is equal to 2/3 of the model \u03c3\u2217 shown in the bottom-right\npanel.\n\nThe overlay of the binned data in Figure 7 from its\ntwo sides show that UGC 463 exhibits little kinematic\nasymmetry, justifying our assumption of axisymmetry in\nthe following sections. In detail, the ionized gas rotation curves exhibit the strongest asymmetry at R . 5\u2032\u2032 .\nUGC 463 is morphologically classified as an SABc galaxy\n(Paper I), suggesting that this low-level asymmetry may\nbe due to non-circular motions imposed by the presence\nof a weak bar. This kinematic asymmetry may also be\nreflected in the stellar data at marginal significance. The\nvelocity-dispersion profiles for both the gas and stars are\nvery symmetric at all radii, more so than the rotation\nvelocities.\n4.3. Radial Kinematic Profiles\nFigure 8 provides the azimuthally averaged kinematics\nanalyzed in Sections 5 and 6, following the same procedure as described in the previous section but over all azimuth. Stellar kinematics combine both SparsePak and\nPPak observations, and ionized-gas kinematics incorporate all tracers from both instruments. Rotation-velocity\nerrors (68% confidence limits) are determined using bootstrap simulations, not by, e.g., considering the difference\n\nin rotation speed between the two sides of the rotation\ncurve; that is, we assume the disk contains no asymmetries such that any asymmetries manifest themselves as\nan increased error in the measured rotation speed via\nbootstrap simulations. The ionized-gas rotation velocity\nat the largest radius is averaged with the radially overlapping H i measurement to slightly extend the radial\ncoverage. The circular-speed curve provided in Figure\n8 results from applying pressure corrections to the gas\nrotation curve, as described in the next section.\nMeasurements of \u03c3gas include only the ionized-gas kinematics, not the colder H i. Although the [O iii] velocity dispersion is significantly larger than the H\u03b1 velocity\ndispersion and decreasing with radius (Figure 7), the azimuthally averaged \u03c3gas is very nearly the same as the\nH\u03b1 velocity dispersion. This is because of the errorweighting and the significantly higher quality of the H\u03b1\nvelocity dispersions. We find h\u03c3gas i = 16.6 \u00b1 1.1 km s\u22121\nwhen excluding the datum near the galaxy center, which\nis nearly constant as a function of radius. This result\nis comparable to similar measurements made in other\nface-on spiral galaxies by Andersen et al. (2006) and, as\nshown by these authors, dominated by turbulence given\n\n\fThe DiskMass Survey. IV.\n\n17\n\nthat \u03b4P > 0.18 Dalcanton & Stilp (2010) propose exponential functions for use in calculating \u03b4P , which is appropriate for our \u03a3gas measurements; however, we adopt\nthe linear function plotted in Figure 8 for \u03c3gas . We calculate 0.2 \u2264 \u03b4P \u2264 3.3 such that the circular-speed corrections range from 0.4 \u2264 (Vc \u2212 Vrot ) \u2264 1.6 km s\u22121 , always\nbelow the measurement error in the gas rotation speed.\nIf we treat the circular-speed corrections independently\nfor [O iii] and H\u03b1, we find the H\u03b1-based and [O iii]-based\ncircular speeds to be more consistent than if one correction is applied to both. However, the combined circularspeeds are roughly independent of whether or not the H\u03b1\nand [O iii] data are treated separately.\n5. THE DISK\n\nUsing the data described above, we measure physical\nproperties of the disk of UGC 463. In summary, we determine the kinematic scale length, h\u03c3 , defined as the efolding length of \u03c3\u2217 (Section 5.1); we determine the shape\nof the SVE such that we can calculate \u03c3z based on our\nmeasurements of \u03c3\u2217 (Section 5.2); we determine the total\ndynamical disk mass surface density, \u03a3dyn , using equation 9 from Paper II (Section 5.3); we calculate the stellar\nmass surface density, \u03a3\u2217 , by removing contributions to\n\u03a3dyn from atomic- and molecular-gas (Section 5.4); we\ncalculate the stability of the isolated gaseous and stellar disks, as well as a quantity for the multi-component\ndisk (Section 5.5); and, finally, we measure the dynamical and stellar mass-to-light ratios in K-band, \u03a5disk\n\u2217,K (Section 5.6).\n\nFigure 8.\nKinematic profiles for UGC 463 averaged over all\nazimuth.

Bottom - Gas\n(open circles) and stellar (filled points) LOS velocity dispersions.\nThe dashed gray lines are the best-fitting linear and exponential\nfunctions for the gas and stellar data, respectively.\n\nthe expected thermal pressure. Physically, the difference\nbetween the H\u03b1 and [O iii] dispersions may be related\nto the different energetics involved in generating the two\nlines; for example, [O iii] emission may be naturally biased toward more turbulent regions of the ISM. From\nFigure 7, we note that the [O iii] dispersion is surprisingly well fit by a radial profile following 2\u03c3\u2217 /3 over a\nlarge radial range; it is of interest to explore the reason\nfor this relationship by comparing with other galaxies.\n4.3.1.

We, thereby, correct our gas rotation\ncurve to the circular speed using our measurements of the\n\u03c3gas in Figure 8 and \u03a3gas in Figure 4.\nOne expects \u03c3gas and \u03a3gas to decrease with radius such\n\n5.1. Kinematic Scale Length, h\u03c3\nMeasurements of \u03c3\u2217 are well fit by an exponential profile; the best-fit exponential has a central dispersion of\n74.7\u00b12.4 kms\u22121 and h\u03c3 = 31.\u2032\u2032 3\u00b11.\u2032\u20328 as plotted in Figure\n8. Given that h\u03c3 \u223c 2.6hR , either \u03a5\u2217 (or more appropriately the dynamical disk mass-to-light ratio, \u03a5dyn ) or the\nscale height, hz , may be increasing exponentially with radius; the implied e-folding length is hR h\u03c3 /(h\u03c3 \u2212 2hR ) =\n57.\u2032\u2032 5. Over the radial range of our data, this suggests a factor of \u223c 2.3 increase in either \u03a5dyn (consistent with, e.g.: Bell & de Jong 2001; Zibetti et al. 2009)\nor hz (compare with edge-on galaxy photometry from,\ne.g.: van der Kruit & Searle 1981a; de Grijs & Peletier\n1997; Narayan & Jog 2002; Bizyaev & Mitronova 2002;\nYoachim & Dalcanton 2006; Saha et al. 2009). The effects of radial variations in \u03a5dyn and/or hz are further\ndiscussed in Section 5.6.\n5.2. Stellar Velocity Ellipsoid Axial Ratios, \u03b1 and \u03b2\nCalculations of disk mass surface density require measurements of \u03c3z . We obtain \u03c3z by correcting \u03c3\u2217 for\nthe shape of the SVE, which can be directly measured\nusing stellar and ionized-gas kinematics (Shapiro et al.\n2003; Noordermeer et al. 2008; Westfall 2009). We define the two axial ratios of the SVE to be \u03b1 = \u03c3z /\u03c3R\nand \u03b2 = \u03c3\u03b8 /\u03c3R . In the limit where the stellar orbits are\nnearly circular, the epicycle approximation (EA) yields\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 \u2202 ln V\u03b8\n2\n+1 ,\n(5)\n\u03b2 2 = \u03b2EA\n\u2261\n2 \u2202 ln R\n18 When \u03c3\n\u22121 (\u03b4\ngas \u221d \u03a3gas \u221d R\nP = 3), equation 4 reduces to\na similar equation used by Swaters et al.

Using\nthese equations, each radially binned measurement of Vc ,\nV\u03b8 , and \u03c3\u22172 provides a direct measurement of \u03b2EA and\n\u03b1 = \u03b1AD , assuming that the derivatives \u2202 ln V\u03b8 /\u2202 ln R\nand \u2202 ln \u03c3\u22172 /\u2202 ln R do not strongly deviate from the fittedmodel expectations; for all measurements we assume\n\u03c3\u22172 = \u03c3\u2217 2 .\nIn Figure 9(a), we calculate \u03b2EA for each radial ring\nusing the parameterized description of V\u03b8 shown in Figure 7. Systematic errors of greater than 15% are expected due to non-circular stellar orbits (Vandervoort\n1975; Kuijken & Tremaine 1991; Dehnen 1999) and nonaxisymmetric streaming motions in the disk near spiral\narms (Vorobyov & Theis 2006, 2008); such effects will\ndominate the . 2% random error shown in Figure 9(a).\nAdopting \u03b2 = \u03b2EA , Figure 9(b) provides \u03b1AD given the\nobserved values of \u03b4AD in Figure 9(c). Note that the\ncalculation of \u03b1AD near the galaxy center provides an\nimaginary result (\u03b12 < 0) and is not shown in Figures\n9(a) or 9(b). Excluding this datum, the mean values are\nh\u03b1AD i = 0.46 and h\u03b2EA i = 0.81.\nWe fit equation 6 to our measurements of \u03b4AD in Figure 9(c) under the assumption that the SVE shape is\nconstant (such that \u03b4AD is linear in radius). We note\nthat \u03b4AD is inversely proportional to \u03b1, and \u03b4AD pivots\nabout \u03b4AD = 2 - where \u03b4AD is independent of \u03b2 - such\nthat an increase in \u03b2 decreases the slope of \u03b4AD (R). Errors in \u03b1 and \u03b2 are estimated using the quadrature sum\nof two quantities: (1) the standard deviation returned\nby a Monte Carlo sampling of the normal distributions\ni = 27\u25e6 \u00b1 2\u25e6 and h\u03c3 = 31.\u2032\u2032 3 \u00b1 1.\u2032\u2032 8; and (2) the mean\nof the error determined from a set of 500 bootstrap simulations performed for each instance of i and h\u03c3 . We\nfind \u03b1 = 0.48 \u00b1 0.09 and \u03b2 = 1.04 \u00b1 0.22, shown as the\ndashed line in Figure 9;19 errors are shown as light- and\ndark-gray regions for \u03b1 and \u03b2, respectively. If we force\n\u03b2 = \u03b2EA when fitting \u03b4AD , we find \u03b1 = 0.44 \u00b1 0.07 with\na fit shown by the solid line in Figure 9.\nFigure 9(a) shows that h\u03b2EA i = 0.81 and \u03b2 = 1.04 \u00b1\n0.22 are different at the level of slightly more than the\nrandom errors. Although interesting, the relevance of\nthis difference to our subsequent analysis is primarily\nwith respect to our conversion of \u03c3\u2217 to \u03c3R (see Section 5.5) and \u03c3z . Figure 9(d) provides individual mea19 Note that we do not use the average nomenclature for these\nmeasurements of \u03b1 and \u03b2, unlike h\u03b1AD i = 0.46 and h\u03b2EA i = 0.81.\nThese fitted parameters describe average properties of the disk but\nthey are not strictly averages of multiple measurements.\n\nsurements of the ratio \u03c3z /\u03c3\u2217 = (\u03b3 cos2 i)\u22121/2 using \u03b1AD\nand \u03b2EA . Adopting i = 27\u25e6 \u00b1 2\u25e6 , \u03b1 = 0.48 \u00b1 0.09,\nand \u03b2 = 1.04 \u00b1 0.22, we calculate the constant value\n\u03c3z /\u03c3\u2217 = 0.76 \u00b1 0.09, which is identical to h\u03c3z /\u03c3\u2217 i calculated using the individual measurements based on \u03b1AD\nand \u03b2EA when excluding the datum near the galaxy center. Assuming \u03b1 = 0.44 \u00b1 0.07 and \u03b2 = \u03b2EA is insignificantly different from \u03c3z /\u03c3\u2217 = 0.76 \u00b1 0.09, as shown by\nthe solid line in Figure 9(d). Moreover, fitting the azimuthal variation in \u03c3\u2217 /\u03c3\u2217 averaged over the full radial\nrange, akin to the analysis done by Gerssen et al. (1997,\n2000) and Shapiro et al. (2003), provides \u03b2 \u223c 0.9, consistent with the error in our measurement based on \u03b4AD\nand, therefore, insignificant to the calculation of \u03c3z /\u03c3\u2217 .\n5.3. Dynamical Disk-Mass Surface Density, \u03a3dyn\nWe calculate \u03a3dyn using equation 9 from Paper II,\nwhich is fundamentally \u03a3dyn = \u03c3z2 /\u03c0kGhz . We calculate \u03c3z using \u03c3\u2217 and our SVE measurements above;\nthe oblateness ratio q = hR /hz , given by equation 1 in\nPaper II, provides the vertical scale height, hz , at the\ndistance D; and the effect of the assumed vertical mass\ndistribution is quantified by k. van der Kruit (1988) calculate the value of k for three vertical mass distributions: exponential (k = 1.5), sech (k = 1.71), and sech2\n(k = 2). As discussed in Paper II, our nominal approach\nis to adopt a purely exponential disk as a reasonable approximation for the composite (gas+stars) density distribution; thus, of the three density distributions discussed\nby van der Kruit (1988), we are effectively maximizing\nthe measurement of \u03a3dyn and, hence, \u03a5disk\n\u2217,K . In Paper II,\nwe suggested a 14% systematic error in k based on the\nrange in k among the exponential, sech, and sech2 distributions. For the case of UGC 463, we increase this\nto k = 1.5 \u00b1 0.3, allowing for a relatively massive gas\ndisk (low k) or spherical DM halo (high k); see further\ndiscussion in Sections 5.6.1 and 6.\nWe use the scale length fitted to \u03bc\u2032K to calculate q\nand hz as provided in Table 2; the band used to define\nhR is insignificant to the result. Figure 10 plots the resulting \u03a3dyn calculations along with the measurements of\n\u03a3Hi and \u03a3H2 from Sections 2.5 and Section 2.6.3, respectively. Random (including contributions from Vsys , mK ,\ni, hR , \u03c3\u2217 , \u03b1, and \u03b2) and systematic (including contributions from q, k, and D) errors are calculated separately;\nthe former are dominated by the error in the SVE and\nthe latter have roughly equal contributions from k and q\n(\u223c 20 \u2212 25%). For clarity, Figure 10 shows neither the\nsystematic error in \u03a3dyn nor any errors in \u03a3Hi and \u03a3H2 ;\nthe systematic errors in \u03a3dyn are comparable to the random errors. Computing the total gas mass surface density, we find a very reasonable fit to \u03a3dyn by scaling \u03a3gas\nby a factor of 3, akin to the correlation of \u03a3gas with \u03bc\u2032K\nshown in Figure 4; \u03a3Hi and \u03a3H2 have been interpolated\nto the radii of the \u03c3\u2217 measurements for this comparison.\n5.4. Stellar Disk-Mass Surface Density, \u03a3\u2217\nCalculations of \u03a5disk\n\u2217,K require a decomposition of \u03a3dyn\ninto stellar and non-stellar components. Five mass components contribute to \u03a3dyn : stars, atomic gas, molecular\ngas, dust, and other non-stellar matter. However, we\naccount for only the first three listed; the others are subsumed in the \"stellar\" mass surface density, \u03a3\u2217 , for the\n\n\fThe DiskMass Survey. IV.\n\n19\n\nFigure 9. SVE results for UGC 463. Dark- and light-gray regions, in any panel, show the error range in \u03b2 = 1.04\u00b10.22 and \u03b1 = 0.48\u00b10.09,\nrespectively, as fitted to the \u03b4AD measurements in panel (c); the dashed line, in any panel, results when these axial ratios are constant\nat all radii. The solid line assumes \u03b2 = \u03b2EA and \u03b1 = 0.44 \u00b1 0.07 (see text). Panel (a) provides \u03b2EA , calculated assuming the model\nstellar rotation curve from Figure 7. Panel (b) provides \u03b1AD calculated assuming \u03b2 = \u03b2EA from panel (a) and measurements of \u03b4AD from\npanel (c). Panel (d) provides measurements of \u03c3z /\u03c3\u2217 assuming \u03b1 = \u03b1AD and \u03b2 = \u03b2EA . Dotted lines in panel (d) give the error range in\n\u03c3z /\u03c3\u2217 = 0.76 \u00b1 0.09.\n\nfollowing reasons. First, our data do not provide dynamically differentiable measurements of the stellar-remnant\nand other DM (baryonic or otherwise) mass. Second,\nthe total dust mass of normal star-forming (or even starbursting) spiral galaxies is expected to be less than 10%\n(and more typically \u223c 1%) of the total hydrogen mass\n(Draine et al. 2007); therefore, it should not be dynamically important to the mass surface density at scales\nrelevant to our analysis.\nOur measurements of \u03a3\u2217 = \u03a3dyn \u2212 1.4(\u03a3Hi + \u03a3H2 ) are\npresented in the bottom panel of Figure 10. As with\n\u03a3dyn , we calculate random and systematic errors in \u03a3\u2217\nseparately; compared with \u03a3dyn , \u03a3\u2217 includes additional\nrandom error from I24\u03bcm and \u03a3Hi and systematic error\nfrom the I24\u03bcm /ICO \u2206V calibration and XCO . Given the\nmodest errors in I24\u03bcm and \u03a3Hi , the random error in\n\u03a3\u2217 is dominated by the errors in \u03c3z ; and, despite the\nlarge systematic uncertainties in I24\u03bcm /ICO \u2206V and XCO\n(roughly 30% for both), the systematic errors in \u03a3\u2217 are\ndominated by the errors in k and q. We plot our \u03a3\u2217\nmeasurements against 2\u03a3gas and \u03bc\u2032K (Section 2.2.2); the\nscale of the plot is such that all \u03a3\u2217 measurements falling\non the \u03bc\u2032K profile have \u03a5disk\n\u2217,K \u223c 0.2. We find that \u03a3\u2217 (R)\nis roughly consistent with both 2\u03a3gas and \u03bc\u2032K at the level\nof the random errors.\n5.5. Global Stability, Q\nWe calculate the global stability, Q, of the gaseous\nand stellar disks separately and for the composite disk\n\nusing our mass-surface-density and velocity-dispersion\nmeasurements.20 These calculations are of interest to our\ndynamical study of UGC 463 given our measurement of\na systematically low \u03a3dyn with respect to a maximal disk\n(see Section 6): A dependence between spiral-arm multiplicity and disk maximality is expected (Toomre 1981;\nAthanassoula et al. 1987) based on stability arguments\nwithin the context of swing-amplification theory - see\nreviews by Athanassoula (1984) and Sellwood (2010).\nQualitatively, one expects a higher spiral-arm multiplicity for lower surface density disks of a fixed rotation\ncurve. This expectation is in line with our measurement\nof a submaximal disk for and the three-arm multiplicity\nof UGC 463 (see Figure 1); however, it should be noted\nthat we find submaximal disks for all 30 galaxies we have\nstudied so far (Paper V; Martinsson 2011), regardless of\ntheir spiral structure. Stability issues will be discussed at\ngreater length based on our full survey stemming from\nthe simple analysis given as an example here for UGC\n463.\nAssuming a razor-thin disk, Toomre (1964) derived\n\u03ba cs\n\u03c0 G \u03a3gas\n\u03ba \u03c3R\nQT,\u2217 =\n,\n3.36 G \u03a3\u2217\n\nQT,gas =\n\n(8)\n(9)\n\n20 Subscripts of Q differentiate between each derivation and\ndisk component.\n\n\f20\n\nWestfall et al.\n\nFigure 10.

The finite thickness of disks systematically increases the stability over that estimated via the\nequations above; however, finite-thickness corrections are\n\nFigure 11. Disk stability measurements for the isolated gaseous\n(open circles) and stellar (filled points) disks following from equations derived by Toomre (1964, QT , top) are plotted in the top\npanel. The multi-component disk stability from Rafikov (2001,\nQR , bottom) for wavenumbers of k\u03bb = 1 (black squares) and k\u03bb = 2\n(gray squares) are provided in the bottom panel. Values of QT,gas\nand QT,\u2217 , and QR for different k\u03bb , are slightly offset in radius\nfor clarity. Random errors are plotted in black; systematic errors,\nnot provided for QR when k\u03bb = 2, are plotted in light gray. The\nvertical dotted line is the same as plotted in Figure 10.\n\nsmall (Romeo 1992).\nFigure 11 provides our measurements of Q for the disk\nof UGC 463; all measurements demonstrate global stability. To calculate \u03ba, we use the derivative of equation\n4 to calculate dVc /dR, adopting the model gas rotation\ncurve from Figure 7 and the model \u03c3gas and \u03b4P functions\ndiscussed in Section 4.3.\nGiven that turbulence dominates the gas kinematics\n(Section 4.3), we calculate QT,gas by replacing cs with\nour measurements of \u03c3gas from the ionized gas.21 Therefore, our measurements of QT,gas may represent upper\nlimits; the measured h\u03c3gas i = 16.6 \u00b1 1.1 km s\u22121 for\nUGC 463 is a factor of two or more greater than the\ntypical turbulent motions seen in the H i or H2 gas\nobserved in local spiral galaxies (Hitschfeld et al. 2009;\nTamburro et al. 2009). Figure 11 shows that QT,gas increases monotonically for R & 4 kpc. In the range\n2 kpc . R . 7 kpc (0.6 . R/hR . 2.0), we find22\n21 Reliable measurements of the H i velocity dispersion are difficult given both the spatial and spectral beam smearing of our\nUGC 463 data.\n22 Quoted errors in mean quantities here and below are (1)\nthe random error in the mean and (2) the quadrature sum of the\nsystematic error and the standard deviation in the quantity.\n\n\fThe DiskMass Survey. IV.\nhQT,gas i = 1.83 \u00b1 0.04+0.79\n\u22120.72 . Thus, in the absence of the\nstellar disk, the gas disk would be globally stable, but\nonly by \u223c 1.2 times the error. A factor of two decrease\nin \u03c3gas would produce an unstable gas disk, when in the\nabsence of the stellar component.\nThe calculation of QT,\u2217 is determined directly from\nthe data shown in Figures 8 and 10, where we calculate\n\u03c3R = (1.59\u00b10.17)\u03c3\u2217 using our measurements of the SVE\naxial ratios (Section 5.2). We find hQT,\u2217 i = 5.2 \u00b1 2.1+3.1\n\u22122.2\nbetween 2 kpc . R . 7 kpc, decreasing to \u223c 0.6QT,gas at\nthe radial limit of our data. The isolated stellar disk appears to be extremely stable, in stark contrast to nominal\nexpectations (Q \u223c 2) based on empirical (e.g., Bottema\n1993) or theoretical (e.g., Sellwood & Carlberg 1984) arguments. Given the mass of the gaseous disk, a measurement of the composite stability is physically more\nmeaningful.\nThe multi-component-disk stability measurement QR\nasymptotically decreases to QR \u223c 2, more in line with the\ntheoretical expectations. In detail, we find hQR i = 2.1 \u00b1\n0.4\u00b10.7 at R & hR for k\u03bb = 1 indicating a globally stable\ndisk;23 measurements assuming k\u03bb = 2, also provided in\nFigure 11, reduce QR by no more than its error. A factor\nof two reduction in \u03c3gas decreases hQR i at R & hR by\n4% and 20% for k\u03bb = 1 and 2, respectively, such that the\ncomposite disk should remain stable in this limit.\ndisk\n5.6.

(2003); and Portinari et al.\n(2004).\n\n21\n\nsurements at small radius may be systematically in error, especially in the presence of a pressure-dominated\nbulge (as possible given the central light concentration;\nSection 2.2.2), a weak bar (Section 4.2), or a massive\nhalo (Section 6). The vertical dashed lined in Figure 12\nmarks where our model of the central light concentration\ncontributes less than 3% to the total light; \u03a3dyn measurements beyond this radius (i.e., R \u2265 2 kpc) should\nnot be strongly affected by either the \"bulge\" or the dynamical assumptions. The two measurements of \u03a5disk\ndyn,K\nand \u03a5disk\n\u2217,K within this radius are not plotted as a function of (g \u2212i)0 . Measurements of (g \u2212i)0 are interpolated\nfrom our SDSS photometry (Section 2.2.1) after accounting for internal reddening (Section 2.2.4); instrumentalsmoothing- and K-corrections have not been applied to\nthe g- or i-band data. We compare our dynamical measurements with SPS model calculations in Figure 12 by\nplotting\n\u03a5SPS\n\u2217,K = dexp[aK + bK (g \u2212 i)0 ],\n\n(13)\n\nwhere the coefficients aK and bK are taken from\nBell et al. (2003, aK = \u22120.211 and bK = 0.137, hereafter B03) and Zibetti et al. (2009, aK = \u22121.379 and\nbK = 0.604, hereafter Z09); these models roughly represent the extrema of similar SPS modeling done by, e.g.,\nBell & de Jong (2001) and Portinari et al. (2004). Consistent with our photometry in Section 2.2, B03 and Z09\nassume K-band measurements are in Vega magnitudes\nand g- and i-band measurements are in AB magnitudes.\nWe discuss our results below after generating approxidisk\nmate probability distributions for \u03a5disk\n\u2217,K (R) and h\u03a5\u2217,K i.\n5.6.1. Probability Distribution\nWe create an approximate probability distribution\n(combining random and systematic components) for our\ndisk\nmeasurements of \u03a5disk\n\u2217,K (R) and h\u03a5\u2217,K i by Monte Carlo\n(MC) sampling individual probability distributions for\neach component of our \u03a5disk\n\u2217,K calculation. In contrast to\nthe random error contributors, systematic errors - particularly in q, k, and XCO - may not be normally distributed, providing the primary motivation for this test.\nOur simulation is limited by the exclusion of any parameter covariance, such as might be manifest in a refitting\nof \u03b1 and \u03b2 after adjusting i; however, we do not expect\nparameter covariance to dramatically change the fundamental conclusions drawn from this MC simulation.\nRandom-error contributors - all quantities with measurement errors contributing to the random error in \u03a5disk\n\u2217,K\n- are assigned Gaussian probability distributions according to their derived \u01eb. We also assign a Gaussian\ndistribution for D (combining the random and systematic\nerror in quadrature) and I24\u03bcm /ICO \u2206V (using the \u00b10.11\ndex error in equation 1). Information on the probability\ndistribution for XCO , particularly for spiral galaxies like\nUGC 463, is limited; therefore, we simply assume a uniform distribution with the range XCO = (2.7\u00b10.9)\u00d71020\ncm\u22122 (K km s\u22121 )\u22121 (Section 2.6.3). We have derived an\nempirical probability distribution for q in Paper II (see\nFigure 1, and references, therein). For our MC simulation, we smooth the growth curve of this empirical distribution by a low-order polynomial to avoid the discretemeasurement quantization noise.\n\n\f22\n\nWestfall et al.\n\ndisk\nFigure 12. Measurements of \u03a5disk\n\u2217,K (filled points) and \u03a5dyn,K (open circles) as a function of radius (left) and (g \u2212 i)0 color (right); the\ndisk\n\u03a5dyn,K measurements are slightly offset in radius from the \u03a5disk\n\u2217,K measurements for clarity. Random errors are plotted in black; systematic\n\nerrors, only plotted for \u03a5disk\n\u2217,K in the left panel, are light gray. The vertical dotted line delineates the radius at which the central light\nconcentration contributes \u223c 3% to the total flux (R = 2 kpc); data within this radius are not shown in the right panel. The solid dark-gray\nSPS\nline provides the mean \u03a5disk\n\u2217,K at R > 2 kpc. The (g \u2212 i)0 colors are used to predict \u03a5\u2217,K based on the work of B03 (dotted line) and Z09\n(dashed line); random errors due to the photometry are shown by the surrounding gray regions in the left panel.\n\nA robust probability distribution for k is elusive, lacking an empirical measurement. For UGC 463, the measurements of a relatively massive gas disk (Section 2.7)\nand DM halo (Section 6) are particularly relevant to the\nvalue of k. In an extreme scenario, the stellar disk is vertically exponential and the gas disk is razor thin, yielding\nan effective 30% decrease in k for our measured values\nof \u03a3gas and \u03a3\u2217 . Despite the resulting increase in \u03a3dyn ,\nwe would still infer a massive DM halo that increases\nk by 20 \u2212 30% (Section 6.3.2) and, therefore, roughly\noffsets the effect of the massive gas disk. In view of\nfurther complications introduced by finite-thickness gas\ndisks, multi-component stellar disks, and triaxial halos,\nwe have decided to take a simple approach and assume\nk is quantized and equally distributed among the exponential (k = 1.5), sech (k = 1.71), and sech2 (k = 2.0)\ncases.\nThe results of our MC simulation are shown in Figure\n13 based on 106 recalculations of \u03a5disk\n\u2217,K for each measurement of \u03c3\u2217 at R \u2265 2 kpc. Each recalculation is binned\nin the two-dimensional (R, \u03a5disk\n\u2217,K ) plane; R is binned in\nphysical units, incorporating the MC sampling of D. For\neach radial bin, we create a growth curve for \u03a5disk\n\u2217,K such\nthat higher intensity (darker) cells in the left panel of\nFigure 13 represent more probable measurement of \u03a5disk\n\u2217,K .\nWe overplot 68%, 95%, and 99% confidence contours for\n\u03a5disk\n\u2217,K (R), as well as a contour following the median value.\nWe also overplot the nominal measurements of \u03a5disk\n\u2217,K from\nFigure 12 for reference, again differentiating between random and systematic error. Figure 13 also provides the\n6\ngrowth curve of h\u03a5disk\n\u2217,K i, calculated for each of the 10\ndisk\nrecalculations of \u03a5\u2217,K (R).\n5.6.2. Discussion\nBased on our nominal calculation (Figure 12), we find\ndisk\nh\u03a5disk\ndyn,K i = 0.34 \u00b1 0.09 \u00b1 0.15 and h\u03a5\u2217,K i = 0.22 \u00b1\n\nK\n0.09+0.16\n\u22120.15 at R > 2 kpc, in units of M\u2299 /L\u2299 . In contrast,\ndisk\nSPS\nB03 and Z09 predict h\u03a5SPS\n\u2217,K i = 3.6h\u03a5\u2217,K i and h\u03a5\u2217,K i =\ndisk\n0.56h\u03a5\u2217,K i, respectively. From our derived probability\n+0.12\ndistribution we find a median of h\u03a5disk\n\u2217,K i = 0.17\u22120.09 such\nthat the Z09 prediction is within our 68% confidence interval; however, B03 predict a measurement that occurs\nfor less than 1 in 105 recalculations of h\u03a5disk\n\u2217,K i. The median value of our probability distribution is below our\nnominal measurement because the median value for k is\nabove our nominal value of k = 1.5. Within the parameter space probed by our MC simulation, we find a\nmaximum measurement of h\u03a5disk\n\u2217,K i = 0.82.\nThe prescriptions adopted for the many ingredients\nof SPS modeling - such as the initial mass function\n(IMF), star-formation and chemical-enrichment history,\ndust content, and the treatment of specific phases of\nstellar evolution - play an important role in setting\n\u03a5SPS\n\u2217,K and its trend with color (Portinari et al. 2004;\nConroy et al. 2009, 2010; Conroy & Gunn 2010). Indeed, in their discussion of the differences between their\n\u03a5\u2217 \u2013color relations and those from B03, Z09 isolate their\ntreatment of the star-formation histories and thermally\npulsating asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) phases of\nstellar evolution from intermediate-age populations as\nthe primary culprits. The latter particularly effects differences in SPS predictions of \u03a5\u2217 in the NIR bands\n(Maraston 2005). Aside from the factor of \u223c 7 difference in the mean B03 and Z09 predictions for UGC 463,\nit is also important to keep in mind that there is an additional factor of 2 or more internal variation in the \u03a5SPS\n\u2217,K\ncalibration associated with each study as determined by\ntheir search of the SPS modeling parameter space. It is\nencouraging that the advancement in SPS modeling, as\nrepresented by the Z09 study, are more consistent with\nour dynamical measurements. However, Figure 12 shows\nthat neither the zeropoint nor the trend of \u03a5\u2217 with (g \u2212i)\n\n\fThe DiskMass Survey. IV.\n\n23\n\nFigure 13. Result of the Monte Carlo simulation outlined in Section 5.6.1. The left panel shows the gray-scale image of the folded\ndisk\ngrowth curve in \u03a5disk\n\u2217,K at a given radius. The median \u03a5\u2217,K (R) lies at the peak intensity (black) as traced by the dashed white line; black\ncontours mark the 68%, 95%, and 99% confidence intervals. The nominal measurements of \u03a5disk\n\u2217,K (R) from Figure 12 are overplotted (black\npoints) with random and systematic errors in black and gray, respectively; data at R < 2 kpc are omitted. The growth curve of h\u03a5disk\n\u2217,K i is\ndisk\nplotted in the right panel. Gray lines mark h\u03a5disk\n\u2217,K i = 0.22 and 0.476; less than 1% and 0.1% of the simulations produce h\u03a5\u2217,K i > 0.476\nand h\u03a5disk\n\u2217,K i > 0.59, respectively.\n\ncolor from these models are a good match to our measurements; therefore, we cannot conclude that this specific SPS treatment - either for the TP-AGB phase or\nstar-formation histories - is correct or applicable to our\nentire sample. An absolute calibration of \u03a5\u2217 using a\nmulti-color approach for the full DMS Phase-B sample\nwill be presented in forthcoming papers.\nAs expected from the discussion in Section 5.1, Figdisk\nure 12 shows \u03a5disk\ndyn,K and \u03a5\u2217,K generally increase with\nradius. Considering only the data at R = 5.6 and 10.8\n+1.2\ndisk\nkpc, \u03a5disk\ndyn,K and \u03a5\u2217,K increase by a factor of 2.2\u00b11.0\u22121.1\n+2.8\nand 3.4 \u00b1 2.3\u22122.5 , respectively. Figure 13 shows that the\nradial trend holds for the median of the probability disSPS\ntribution in \u03a5disk\n\u2217,K (R). Variation in \u03a5\u2217,K is expected in\ngalaxy disks given the observed arm/inter-arm and radially averaged color gradients. Yet, in terms of the latter,\nFigure 12 shows that the variation in \u03a5disk\n\u2217,K for UGC 463\nis consistent with neither of the plotted \u03a5SPS\n\u2217,K predictions.\nGiven both the errors in our measurement and the errors\nin the \u03a5SPS\n\u2217,K calibration, it is difficult for us to conclude\nthat our measurements are inconsistent with a radially\ndisk\ninvariant \u03a5disk\n\u2217,K . Indeed, a radially independent \u03a5\u2217,K is\nconsistent with our 68% confidence limits derived in Figure 13.\nMoreover, the more shallow decline of \u03c3z2 with respect\nto the surface-brightness profile, which is the primary\ndriver for our measurement of a radially varying \u03a5disk\n\u2217,K ,\nmay also be interpreted as a flaring of the stellar disk\n(Section 5.1). A flared stellar disk has been measured for\nthe Galaxy (L\u00f3pez-Corredoira et al. 2002; Robin et al.\n2003; Momany et al. 2006) and one might expect disks to\nbe flared due to, e.g., interactions with dark and/or luminous satellites (Hayashi & Chiba 2006; Dubinski et al.\n2008; Read et al. 2008; Kazantzidis et al. 2009). Indeed,\nHerrmann et al. (2009) suggest their measurements of\n\na nearly constant \u03c3z at large radii in M 83 and M 94\nprovide evidence for such interactions. However, the\nonset radius for disk flaring is expected to be beyond\nthe region relevant to our dynamical measurements for\nUGC 463. Robust photometric evidence for stellar-disk\nflares in edge-on galaxies remains elusive: The empirical and theoretical foundation for the vertical structure\nof galaxy disks with radially independent scale heights\ndeveloped by van der Kruit & Searle (1981a,b, 1982a,b)\nremains the current paradigm due to repeated confirmations of little to no variation in scale height measurements from surface photometry, particularly for galaxies of similar Hubble type to UGC 463 (SABc) (e.g.,\nde Grijs & Peletier 1997; Bizyaev & Mitronova 2002).\nHowever, claims of factors of 2 or more increase in scale\nheight within the optical extent of some stellar disks exist\nin the literature (e.g., Narayan & Jog 2002; Saha et al.\n2009). For our UGC 463 data, the measured increase in\n\u03a5disk\n\u2217,K with radius is consistent with these claims; however, we cannot claim a stellar-disk flare exists in UGC\n463 based solely on our data. Therefore, barring more detailed information on the disk structure of UGC 463, we\nsimplify our mass decomposition in Section 6 by largely\nfocusing on results that assume \u03a5disk\n\u2217,K and hz are constant\nfor the entire disk.\nFinally, we note that our data provide a few, limited\nassessments of the presence of a \"DM disk\" in UGC 463.\nSuch a structure has been predicted by recent simulations\n(e.g., Read et al. 2009) and modeling of the Galaxy by\nKalberla (2003) (cf., Moni Bidin et al. 2010). DM disks\nare expected to be more extended both radially and vertically than stellar thin disks; Kalberla (2003) fit a DM\ndisk that has a scale length and scale height that are,\nrespectively, three and 10 times larger than for the stellar thin disk. Our stellar kinematic data are expected to\ntrace the thin disk mass distribution only such that we\n\n\f24\n\nWestfall et al.\n\ncan place an upper limit on any DM distributed identically to this structure as follows: Assuming the \u03a5SPS\n\u2217,K\nprediction from Z09 is exactly correct, our \u03a5disk\n\u2217,K measurements suggest a thin DM disk that has \u223c 80% of\nthe stellar mass surface density (or \u223c 30% of the baryonic mass surface density). One can increase the mass\nsurface density of a DM disk in UGC 463 by proportionally increasing its scale height with relatively moderate\neffects on our calculation of \u03a3dyn . Assuming no influence on \u03a3dyn , the scale height of the DM disk would\nneed to be roughly the same as the thin-disk scale length\nto reach the mass ratio that Kalberla (2003) measure\nfor the Galaxy. Although one may accommodate such\na disk within the current understanding of DM disks,\nsuch a structure is mostly conjectural with respect to\nour data. Given the uncertainty in both the expected\nvertical distribution of a DM disk and the SPS modeling results for \u03a5SPS\n\u2217,K , our mass decomposition assumes no\nDM disk exists in UGC 463, which is consistent with our\nobservations.\n6. MASS BUDGET\n\nWe produce a detailed mass budget of UGC 463\nvia a traditional rotation-curve mass decomposition\n(e.g., Carignan & Freeman 1985; van Albada et al. 1985;\nBegeman et al. 1991). We assume\nX\nVj2 ,\n(14)\nVc2 =\nj\n\nwhere Vj is the circular-speed of a test particle associated\nwith potential-density pair \u03a6j and \u03c1j for each mass component j; all potential-density pairs are considered independent and separable, neglecting any covariance among\nthe j components (cf., vAS86; Amorisco & Bertin 2010).\nWe calculate Vj for each baryonic mass component based\non our mass-surface-density measurements using rotmod,\na program within the GIPSY25 software package that calculates Vj for oblate and spherical density distributions\n(following Casertano 1983).\nStudies of our Galaxy suggest the potential-density\nstructure of UGC 463 may be very complex. For simplicity, we assume here that the total gravitational potential\nis composed of four unique, axisymmetric density distributions, yielding the following circular speeds: (1) Vhalo\nfor the spherical halo, (2) V\u2217bulge for the stellar bulge, (3)\ndisk\nV\u2217disk for the stellar disk, and (4) Vgas\nfor the gaseous\ndisk. We attribute the central light concentration to a\nbulge (cf. Dutton 2009, who propose such surface density peaks may be attributed to the disk); however, our\nuse of the term \"bulge\" does not distinguish between a\n(disk-like) pseudo-bulge (Kormendy & Kennicutt 2004)\nor (spherical) classical bulge. We neglect any significant contribution from, e.g., an inner halo, thick stellar\ndisk, or flattened dark-matter component for two reasons: (i) Our spectroscopic and imaging data present\nno evidence for significant contributions of such components to either the measured kinematics or the stellar\nlight profile; and, therefore, (ii) if present, the influence\nof such mass components is negligible with respect to our\n25\nGroningen\nImage\nhttp://www.astro.rug.nl/~ gipsy/.\n\nProcessing\n\nSystem;\n\nTable 7\nUGC 463 Enclosed Mass at 15 kpc (4.2hR )\n\nComponent\n\nMass\n(1010 M\u2299 )\n\nStellar Bulge\nStellar Disk\nTotal Stars\nAtomic Hydrogen\nMolecular Hydrogen\nTotal Gas\nBaryonic Matter\nDark Matter\nTotal Mass\n\n0.22 \u00b1 0.09 \u00b1 0.16\n2.6 \u00b1 1.1+1.9\n\u22121.8\n2.8 \u00b1 1.2+2.0\n\u22121.9\n0.24 \u00b1 0.02\n0.76 \u00b1 0.04+0.34\n\u22120.31\n1.40 \u00b1 0.07+0.47\n\u22120.43\n4.2 \u00b1 1.1+2.1\n\u22121.9\n+3.2\n13.5+1.9\n\u22122.4 \u22124.2\n+2.2 +3.8\n17.7\u22122.7 \u22124.6\n\nMass Fraction\nBaryonic Total\n(%)\n(%)\n5.2\n62\n67\n5.7\n18\n33\n\n1.2\n15\n16\n1.4\n4.3\n7.9\n24\n76\n\nanalysis of the gravitational potential in UGC 463. Furthermore, we assume the halo is dominated by DM (i.e.,\nVhalo \u2248 VDM ) and the vertical distributions of the atomic\ndisk\nand molecular gas are identical (Vgas\nis determined by\n\u03a3gas directly). We define the baryonic circular speed,\ndisk 2\nVb2 = (V\u2217bulge )2 + (V\u2217disk )2 + (Vgas\n) , such that we can\n2\nisolate the DM mass contribution via VDM\n= Vc2 \u2212 Vb2 .\nThe fundamental advantage of our rotation-curve mass\ndecomposition over previous studies is that Vb is uniquely\ndefined by our observations.\nIn summary, we calculate the circular speeds of all\nbaryonic mass components in Section 6.1; we measure VDM (R) and the DM-halo volume-density profile,\n\u03c1DM (R), in Section 6.2; and we discuss the relative contributions of the baryonic matter and DM components to\nthe total mass budget of UGC 463 in Section 6.3 finding\nthat DM dominates at R > hR .\n6.1. Baryonic Mass and Circular Speed\nFollowing the bulge-disk decomposition discussed in\nSection 2.2.2, we calculate the mass-surface-density\ndistribution for each stellar component assuming\n+0.16\n\u03a5\u2217,K (R) = h\u03a5disk\n\u2217,K i = 0.22 \u00b1 0.09\u22120.15 . We use a single\n\u03a5\u2217,K for the disk and bulge components, which is reasonable considering the marginal change in \u03a5SPS\n\u2217,K between\nthe disk- and bulge-dominated regions in Figure 12. The\nresults are shown in Figure 14 along with our measurements of \u03a3gas . We calculate masses enclosed within\nR = 15 kpc (R = 4.2hR ) for all baryonic components\nin Table 7 by integrating each mass-surface-density profile; these results are further discussed in Section 6.3.3.\nWe note that the instrumental-smoothing correction to\n\u03bc\u2032K (Section 2.2.2) amounts to a marginal 3% increase of\nthe stellar-bulge mass.\nCircular-speed calculations for each baryonic component use the mass-surface-density profiles in Figure 14\nand an assigned three-dimensional, axisymmetric density\ndistribution. We assume any truncation of each mass element occurs well beyond our last dynamical measurement. We assume \u03a3gas is distributed in a razor-thin disk;\nand, consistent with our previous assumptions, we adopt\nan exponential vertical distribution for the stellar disk\nwith a constant scale height of hz = 0.44 kpc. For the\nstellar bulge (or central mass concentration), our nominal approach is to assume a spherical distribution.\n\n\fThe DiskMass Survey. IV.\n\nFigure 14. Mass-surface-density (top) and circular-speed (bottom) distributions for the stellar bulge (dotted line), stellar disk\n(dot-dashed line), gaseous disk (dashed line), and all baryonic matter (solid black line) in UGC 463 assuming a constant \u03a5\u2217,K (R).\nOur measurements of \u03a3dyn at R > 2 kpc are overplotted as open\nsymbols in the top panel for reference, which are directly traced\nduring our calculations assuming a variable \u03a5\u2217,K (R). Dark- and\nlight-gray regions illustrate, respectively, the random and systematic error in \u03a3b and Vb . The solid gray lines assume \u03a5\u2217,K = \u03a5SPS\n\u2217,K\nas predicted by B03. Measurements of the DM-only circular speed\n(VDM ; black triangles) are calculated by subtracting Vb from Vc\n(open triangles) in quadrature. Random and systematic errors in\nVDM are shown as black and gray error bars, respectively.\n\nDue to our imposition of a constant \u03a5\u2217,K for the\nmass decomposition illustrated in Figure 14, the surface density of all baryonic mass components, \u03a3b , does\nnot exactly follow our \u03a3dyn measurements. We have\nalso performed a more direct mass decomposition that\nadopts \u03a3b = \u03a3dyn by applying a smooth interpolation for\n\u03a5\u2217,K (R) = \u03a5disk\n\u2217,K (R) at 2 < R < 11 kpc; we extrapolate\nby simply extending the \u03a5disk\n\u2217,K measurements at the two\nendpoints of this range to small and large radius. This\napproach does not produce statistically different values\nfor the quantities discussed below. For completeness, Table 8 provides the implied DM properties for both a constant and variable \u03a5\u2217,K (R); however, we simplify the\ndiscussion below by primarily focusing on the results obtained by assuming a constant \u03a5\u2217,K (R). This approach\nis justified by the consistency of our measurements with\na radially invariant \u03a5disk\n\u2217,K as discussed in Section 5.6.2.\n\n25\n\nIn addition to the constant \u03a5\u2217,K based on our dynamical measurements, Figure 14 also provides the calculation of \u03a3b and Vb assuming \u03a5\u2217,K = \u03a5SPS\n\u2217,K = 0.79,\nbased on the prediction of B03; adopting the Z09 prediction produces Vb within the systematic errors of our\ndynamical measurements. The stellar and baryonic mass\nare, thereby, increased by a factor of 3.6 and 2.7, respectively, resulting in a maximal disk (i.e., Vb \u223c Vc ).\nTherefore, we can account for the measured rotation velocity within R \u2264 3.2hR by simply scaling \u03bc\u2032K by a constant \u03a5\u2217,K . This result is not unexpected given that\nthe \"diet Salpeter\" IMF, used by B03, was chosen by\nBell & de Jong (2001) to accommodate the \"maximumdisk\" rotation-curve mass decompositions produced by\nVerheijen (1997). Moreover, this is consistent with the\nexpectation from most rotation-curve mass decompositions in the literature performed within similar radial\nregimes (see discussion by Sancisi 2004), including the recent study of dwarf galaxies performed by Swaters et al.\n(2011). However, we have shown in Section 5.6 that the\ndisk\nassumption \u03a5\u2217,K = \u03a5SPS\n\u2217,K = 0.79 is rejected by our \u03a5\u2217,K\nmeasurements at \u226b 99% confidence. That is, while it\nis possible to account for the rotation curve of UGC 463\nwithin R \u2264 3.2hR without invoking DM, DM is effectively required by our treatment of the observed stellar\nkinematics and, in fact, dominates the mass budget (Section 6.3.3). Moreover, the implied DM-mass distribution\nmust be substantially less oblate than the baryonic-mass\n(disk) distribution traced by our stellar kinematics to simultaneously explain our measurements of Vc and \u03c3\u2217 , as\ndiscussed in Section 5.6.2.\nWe note here that the DM properties we infer below are\nrobust against many of the assumptions made above concerning the detailed baryonic mass decomposition. First,\nour characterization of the intrinsic central light concentration is a marginal consideration for calculating Vb .\nFor the innermost measurement of Vc (R = 0.7 kpc), Vb\nis 10% (9.1 km s\u22121 ) higher for our nominal measurement\nthan if we were to adopt the stellar-disk density distribution at all radii; the random errors are 15%. This\ndifference increases to 25% (23.3 km s\u22121 ) if we also omit\nthe instrumental-smoothing correction to \u03bc\u2032K ; however,\nthe difference at the radius of the second measurement\nof Vc (at R = 1.5 kpc) in this case is only 2% (3.5\nkm s\u22121 ). Second, we find statistically equivalent measurements of the DM rotation speed, VDM , when simply\ncalculating Vb directly from \u03a3b = \u03a3dyn and assuming\nthe nominal oblateness of the disk. The detailed baryonic\nmass decomposition presented here is meant to couch our\nrotation-curve mass decomposition within the traditional\nconstruct found in the literature and to provide insight\ninto the baryonic mass budget of UGC 463.\n\n6.2. Dark-Matter-Halo Circular Speed, Mass, and\nVolume Density\n2\nFigure 14 provides measurements of VDM\n= Vc2 \u2212Vb2 assuming a constant \u03a5\u2217,K (R); the enclosed mass of the pre+1.3 +2.1\n10\nsumed spherical halo is Mhalo\nDM = (8.9\u22121.6 \u22122.9 )\u00d710 M\u2299\nwithin the radial range of our measurements (R \u2264 11.4\nkpc).

Upper limit arrows are used for data with random errors of \u01eb(\u03c1DM ) > \u03c1DM . The best-fitting NFW (solid lines)\nand pseudo-isothermal (dashed lines) parameterizations of the DMhalo are shown against the data. For reference, dotted lines in the\nbottom panel provide simple power-law density distributions following \u03c1DM \u221d R\u2212a for a = 1 and 2; zero-points are set to approximately match the trend at small and large radius for a = 1 and\na = 2, respectively.\n\nhalo volume-density profile via\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2\n2\nVDM\nd ln VDM\n\u03c1DM =\n1\n+\n4\u03c0GR2\nd ln R\n\n(15)\n\n(de Blok et al. 2001; Swaters et al. 2003a) as shown in\n2\nFigure 15, where we calculate dVDM\n/dR = dVc2 /dR \u2212\n2\ndVb /dR based on the model values for Vc and Vb . The\ncalculation of dVc /dR is the same as used in Section 5.5\nto calculate \u03ba, and the calculation of dVb /dR is done via\nfinite-differencing of the Vb data in Figure 14. Measurements of \u03c1DM are upper limits at R & 4 kpc (R & 1.1hR )\nbecause the random error, \u01eb(\u03c1DM ), becomes larger than\nthe measured value.\nWe model the VDM data in Figure 15 using a spherical\n\"NFW\" halo (Navarro et al. 1996, 1997) and a pseudoisothermal sphere (Ostriker & Caldwell 1979; Schmidt\n1985; Kent 1986). The former is parameterized by the total halo mass, Mhalo\nDM , and its concentration c = R200 /Rs ,\nwhere R200 is the radius at which the halo reaches 200\ntimes the critical density (\u03c1crit = 3H02 /8\u03c0G) and Rs is\nthe characteristic scale of the density profile; as above, we\nadopt H0 = 73 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 . The pseudo-isothermal\nsphere is parameterized by its central density, \u03c10 , and\ncore radius, Rc . Best-fitting DM halo parameters are\ndetermined by \u03c72 -minimization, where \u03c72 is defined using only the random errors. Bootstrap simulations are\nused to calculate the random error in each the parameter.\nSystematic errors are based on 100 simulations of refitting the DM halo after MC sampling of the systematic\n\nerrors in VDM , again minimizing a \u03c72 incorporating only\nthe random errors. The best-fitting DM halo models are\nplotted against our measurements in Figure 15; we provide the best-fitting parameters for both a constant and\nvariable \u03a5\u2217,K (R) in Table 8. Statistically, the NFW and\npseudo-isothermal halos are equally suitable descriptions\nof the DM halo of UGC 463, and there is only a marginal\ndifference between the results when using a constant or\nvariable \u03a5\u2217,K (R). While the reduced \u03c72 is lower when\nadopting a constant \u03a5\u2217,K (R), the systematic deviations\nof the data about the model is such that this difference\nis not statistically meaningful. For comparison, Figure\n15 also shows simple power-law density profiles following\n\u03c1DM \u221d R\u2212a for a = 1 and 2; zero-points have been set\nby-eye in each case.\nWe measure the concentration of the NFW halo to be\nc = 19+3\n\u22122 in reasonable agreement with the expectation\nfor low-redshift DM halos of similar mass (Navarro et al.\n1997; Bullock et al. 2001). Thus, consistent with our\nmeasurement of a relatively low-mass disk, it appears\nthat the baryons have had little effect on the structure\nof the DM halo. However, it is difficult to assess the\nphysical meaning of this concentration index given the\nsimplicity of our halo fitting; specifically, we do not include adiabatic contraction, which should be a relatively\nsmall effect given the expected gravitational influence of\nthe baryons. It is interesting that the innermost \u03c1DM\ndatum indicates a steeper slope than provided by either\nof the DM-halo parameterizations, demonstrating a \u223c 2\nas opposed to unity. However, the error in this measurement is large and is highly subject to our treatment of\nthe central mass concentration. The full DMS sample\nwill provide stronger statistical constraints on the inner\nhalo profile.\n6.3. The Dominant Gravitational Influence of Dark\nMatter\nAs discussed in Section 1, assessments of the relative\ncontribution of dark and baryonic matter to disk-galaxy\nmass budgets have been limited by the disk-halo degeneracy (van Albada et al. 1985). We have measured these\ncontributions directly for UGC 463. Although allowing\nfor a novel investigation of the DM mass distribution,\nit is useful to cast our analysis also in terms of a traditional approach such that we can compare with previous\nstudies.\nIn particular, a common praxis in rotation-curve mass\ndecomposition is the so-called \"maximum-disk\" hypothesis (vAS86), producing an extremum of the mass budget. Application of the \"maximum-disk\" hypothesis\namounts to maximizing a radially independent mass-tolight ratio while adjusting any DM-halo parameters to\nfit the observed circular speed; however, exact implementations have varied. All baryonic components have\nbeen approximated by a single exponential disk (as in\nvan Albada et al. 1985), values of \u03a5\u2217 have been distinct\n(as in, e.g., Kent 1986, 1987) or identical (as done above)\nfor the bulge and disk components; and the gas disk has\nbeen subsumed into or isolated from the stellar component(s). Thus, one should keep in mind that, although\ntermed the \"maximum-disk\" hypothesis, the direct association of this hypothesis with the stellar disk, in particular, can be tenuous in its practical implementation.\nRegardless, all implementations minimize the DM con-\n\n\fThe DiskMass Survey.

Galaxies\nadhering to the \"maximum-disk\" hypothesis are often\nsaid to have maximal disks; however, this definition remains inchoate.\nThe \"maximality\" of a galaxy is often assessed via the\nstellar-disk mass fraction, F\u2217disk = V\u2217disk /Vc (equation 11\nin Paper II). This quantity is traditionally measured at\n2.2hR , the radius at which the circular speed peaks for\nrazor-thin, radially exponential disks (see the generalization to oblate disks in Paper II). In the idealized case of\na two-component galaxy with a spherical DM halo and\nan exponential stellar disk, F\u2217disk (R = 2.2hR ) uniquely\nquantifies the influence of the DM on the mass budget\nat all radii for a given disk scale length, oblateness, and\nDM-halo density parameterization. This idealized case\nprovides a useful fiducial model with which to compare\nobservations, as we discuss below. Real galaxies deviate\nfrom the idealized case due to (1) the inclusion of other\nbaryonic components with generally different mass distributions, such as bulges and gaseous disks, and (2) perturbations of the stellar-disk mass-surface-density profile away from the nominal exponential, as inferred from\nsurface-brightness variations. Thus, as explicitly associated with the stellar disk, F\u2217disk (R = 2.2hR ) has an\nintrinsic distribution for maximal disks: Sackett (1997)\nadopted F\u2217disk (R = 2.2hR ) = 0.85 \u00b1 0.10 as an appropriate definition for maximal disks in galaxies of similar\nHubble type to the Milky Way (Sb to Sc), also representative of the DMS Phase-B sample. We directly compare\nthis definition to our measurements in UGC 463; however, we note that the literature studies upon which this\ndefinition was based do not remove the molecular gas\ncomponent from the total disk mass distribution as we\ndo for UGC 463.\nAs roughly synonymous throughout the discussion\nby vAS86, the \"maximum-disk\" hypothesis could also\nbe termed the \"maximum-baryon\" or \"minimum-darkmatter\" hypothesis. In this respect, it is also useful to\ncalculate the baryonic mass fraction, Fb = Vb /Vc .26 As\nimplemented by vAS86, Fb \u2248 F\u2217disk at least in the sense\nthat their mass-to-light ratios incorporated all mass distributed similarly to the luminous disk and they assumed\nthe stellar disk was by far the most massive baryonic\ncomponent. Our detailed accounting of multiple bary26 This should not be confused with the total baryon fraction,\ntot\nFbar = Mtot\nbar /Mdyn , discussed in Paper II.\n\nonic components in UGC 463 with different mass distributions, particularly with regard to the massive gas disk,\nmeans that (1) Fb 6= F\u2217disk and (2) quoting F\u2217disk (2.2hR )\nhas a more limited bearing on the relative influence of\nthe baryonic and DM mass on the total mass budget\nthan described above. Therefore, it is useful to consider\nthe radial functions F\u2217disk (R) and Fb (R) and to define\nmultiple fiducial radii for Fb based on the expectation\nof that each baryonic component can dominate the mass\nbudget in distinct radial regimes.\nOne expects Fb to decrease with radius as DM increasingly dominates the mass budget. The \"maximumdisk\" hypothesis effectively states Fb \u223c 1 at small radius, regardless of whether or not the disk or bulge dominates the baryonic mass (see the implementation of the\n\"maximum-disk\" hypothesis by, e.g., Kent 1986, 1987).\nThe application of Fb \u223c 1 at small radius to Sb\u2013Sc galaxies has shown F\u2217disk (2.2hR ) = 0.85, which may be considered a lower limit for Fb at these radii. Finally, it\nis expected that Fb \u2192 0 at large radius because rotation curves have been shown to remain nearly constant\nup to the radial extent of H i disks. The recent study\nby Dutton et al. (2011b) has shown that this expectation for Fb (R) is likely a limited picture of the range in\ngalaxy properties. By combining strong lensing analysis and stellar kinematics, Dutton et al. have shown\nFb (Re ) = 0.99 and Fb (2.2hR ) = 0.67 for the late-type\nlens galaxy SDSS J2141-0001, which is at a redshift of\n0.14; Re is the effective (half-light) radius of the bulge\n(Section 2.2.2). Thus, while adhering to the fundamental\ntenant of the \"maximum-disk\" hypothesis, SDSS J21410001 exhibits a disk that is relatively less massive than\nthe disks of local Sb\u2013Sc galaxies, such that it would be\nconsidered \"submaximal\" under the definition proposed\nby Sackett (1997).\nFor UGC 463, we assess the ratio of the dark and baryonic mass components via the mass fractions F\u2217disk and\nFb in Section 6.3.1. We quote Fb at Re = 0.5 kpc and\n2.2hR = 7.8 kpc as to compare with both the expectations from the \"maximum-disk\" hypothesis and the results from Dutton et al. (2011b).27 These radii are close\nto the radii at which the circular speeds of the stellar\ncomponents are maximized (Figure 14). We also quote\n27 In galaxies with extended gas disks, one might also quote\nFb at a radius where the gas disk dominates the baryonic circular\nspeed; however, Figure 14 shows that there is no such radius for\nUGC 463 within the radial regime of our measurements.\n\n\f28\n\nWestfall et al.\n\nF\u2217disk (2.2hR ) for a direct comparison with the definition\nof a maximal disk proposed by Sackett (1997). Further\nassessments are made using the ratio of the mid-plane\nvolume densities (\u03c1DM /\u03c1b )z=0 in Section 6.3.2 and the\nenclosed-mass budget in Section 6.3.3. In all of these sections, we compare our measurements for UGC 463 with\nan idealized, maximal-disk galaxy; this model provides\nthe equivalent quantities for a maximal disk that has\nbeen embedded in the NFW and pseudo-isothermal halos fitted to our measurements of VDM (Section 6.2). This\nfiducial maximal disk has the scale length and oblateness\nas measured for UGC 463, is purely exponential in both\nR and z and has Fdisk = 0.85 at R = 2.2hR . Here, our\nnotation Fdisk , as opposed to F\u2217disk , purposely leaves the\nnature of the matter in the disk undefined, as done by\nvAS86 in their implementation of the \"maximum-disk\"\nhypothesis. The combination of this fiducial maximal\ndisk and our fitted DM halos produces a substantially\nhigher circular speed than we measure for UGC 463,\nand the shape of the rotation curve does not adhere to\nthe disk-halo conspiracy (vAS86); we have shown in Section 6.1 that application of the \"maximum-disk\" hypothesis to UGC 463 essentially results in a marginal DM-halo\nmass within the radial regime probed by our data.\nBefore continuing, we note that Bottema (1993, 1997)\nused kinematic measurements similar to our own and\nfound Fdisk (2.2hR ) = 0.63 \u00b1 0.10 for a sample of 12 latetype galaxies; Bottema did not differentiate between stellar and gas components in this decomposition, hence our\nuse of Fdisk . In detail, Bottema's assumptions are not exactly the same as our own; however, we can cast UGC 463\nin terms of his measurement to find Fdisk (2.2hR ) = 0.6,\nwhich is compatible with these previous results. We also\nnote that, using planetary nebulae as kinematic tracers, Herrmann & Ciardullo (2009) reported submaximal\ndisks for four of the five galaxies they studied.\n6.3.1. Stellar-Disk and Baryonic Mass Fractions, F\u2217disk\nand Fb\n\nFigure 16 provides F\u2217disk and Fb as a function of radius\nassuming a constant \u03a5\u2217,K (R). Individual data points use\nour direct measurements of Vc , whereas the gray lines\n2\ncalculate Vc2 = Vb2 + VDM\nusing Vb from Figure 14 and\nVDM from the NFW and pseudo-isothermal halos fitted in\nFigure 15. Both F\u2217disk (R) and Fb (R) are effectively constant between 1.0 . R/hR . 3.5; the roughly constant\nFb \u2212 F\u2217disk at these radii reflects the similarity between\nthe radial distribution of the gas and stars. Figure 16\nalso provides the expected Fdisk for the fiducial maximum disk, which is the same for the NFW and pseudoisothermal halos at R & 0.5hR . The shape of F\u2217disk (R) is\nvery similar to that calculated for a maximal disk, which\nis essentially a statement that \u03bc\u2032K is very close to an exponential after subtracting the central light concentration;\nhowever, the normalization is very different. At small\nradius, Fb and F\u2217disk diverge largely due to the exclusion\nof the central mass concentration in the calculation of\nthe latter.\nTable 8 gives Fb (Re ), Fb (2.2hR ), and F\u2217disk (2.2hR ) for\nboth the constant and variable \u03a5\u2217,K (R) assumptions.\nOur measurement of Fb (Re ) has significant uncertainty\ndue to the error in measurement of Vc at this radius\n(largely due to centering errors), the uncertainty in the\nbaryonic rotation speed, and the difference in the ex-\n\nFigure 16.

To the contrary, both Fb and F\u2217disk at\n2.2hR are relatively well constrained. Following the definition proposed by Sackett (1997) and assuming a constant \u03a5\u2217,K (R), these quantities demonstrate that UGC\n463 has a substantially submaximal disk by a factor of\n\u223c (0.85/0.46)2 \u2248 3.4 in mass; this reduces to 1.9 if one\ninstead defines Fb (2.2hR ) = 0.85 as a maximal disk.\nThese factors are consistent with our previous discussion in Sections 5.6.2 and 6.1 regarding the comparison\nof our dynamical measurements with the SPS predictions\nfrom B03. Adopting a variable \u03a5\u2217,K (R) results in a mass\nprofile of the disk that yields a peak rotation speed at or\nbeyond the limit of our calculation (R = 15 kpc), whereas\nthe constant \u03a5\u2217,K (R) disk has a peak rotation at 2.7hR .\nHowever, in both cases the stellar (and baryonic) disk\nremains submaximal due to the relatively constant value\nof F\u2217disk (and Fb ) at R > hR . Although it is possible that\nthe baryonic mass is close to satisfying the Fb (Re ) \u223c 1\ngiven the uncertainty, our data suggest that the circular\nspeed may have substantial contributions from DM even\nwithin the bulge region.\n6.3.2. Mid-Plane Volume-Density Ratio, (\u03c1DM /\u03c1b )z=0\nOur mass-surface-density and \u03c1DM measurements from\nFigures 14 and 15, respectively, provide the mid-plane\nvolume-density ratio between the dark and baryonic matter, (\u03c1DM /\u03c1b )z=0 . We assume that the stratification of\nthe gaseous and stellar disks combine to produce an\nexponential vertical density distribution with a single\nscale height hz and that the bulge is spherical. Thus,\nthe baryonic volume density at the disk mid-plane is\n(\u03c1b )z=0 = (\u03a3\u2217 +\u03a3gas )/2hz +\u03c1bulge . If the gas is more confined to the plane, this calculation results in upper limits.\nFigure 17 provides the mid-plane volume-density ratio\nwhen assuming a constant \u03a5\u2217,K (R), where the discrete\n\n\fThe DiskMass Survey.

The\ncalculation of (\u03c1b )z=0 is discussed in the text. Data points use\nthe \u03c1DM measurements from Figure 15, whereas gray lines use the\nNFW (gray solid lines) and pseudo-isothermal (gray dashed lines)\nparameterizations of \u03c1DM . Only random errors are shown; upper\nlimit arrows are used when the error is larger than the measured\nvalue. The results for the fiducial maximal disk are plotted as black\nlines for both the NFW (solid black lines) and pseudo-isothermal\n(dashed black lines) DM halo parameterizations.\n\nmeasurements use the non-parametric calculation of \u03c1DM\nand the gray lines use the NFW and pseudo-isothermal\nsphere parameterizations. We also plot the expectation\nfor the fiducial maximal disk discussed above. For reference, Bienaym\u00e9 et al. (2006) find (\u03c1DM /\u03c1b )z=0 = 0.14 in\nthe solar neighborhood assuming a spherical halo.\nAt R \u226b z, the change in \u03c1DM with z is much smaller\nthan the change in \u03c1b such that (\u03c1DM /\u03c1b ) \u221d exp(|z|/hz ).\nAveraging the data at 1 < R/hR < 3 in Figure 17, we\nfind that (\u03c1DM /\u03c1b )z=0 \u223c 0.2, which is a factor of 5 larger\nthan the expectation for a maximal disk (only 40% larger\nthan the Milky-Way value). The mass volume density\nof UGC 463 is, therefore, dominated by dark matter at\n|z| & 1.6hz at R & hR . This result is particularly important for our understanding of out-of-plane motions in the\ndisk of UGC 463: The derivation of \u03a3dyn = \u03c3z2 /\u03c0kGhz\nassumes an isolated, plane-parallel, infinite disk. Deviations from these assumptions, such as embedding the\ndisk in a very massive DM halo, introduces systematic\nerrors in the calculation, as briefly discussed in Paper II.\nThe result for (\u03c1DM /\u03c1b )z=0 in UGC 463 suggests that\nsuch effects may be significant for this galaxy.\nBottema (1993) has discussed the influence of a massive DM halo on \u03c3z in disk stars, continuing the work\nof Bahcall (1984). These authors find that \u03c3z should be\ninflated relative to an isolated disk when embedded in\na massive, spherical halo; the degree of the inflation is\nproportional to (\u03c1DM /\u03c1b )z=0 , as shown in Figure 15 from\nBottema (1993). For the fiducial maximal disk shown in\nour Figure 17, Bottema (1993) would predict a less than\n5% increase in the \u03c3z over an isolated disk, whereas our\nmeasurements for UGC 463 from Figure 17 suggest \u03c3z\ncould be increased by 10 \u2212 15%. This means that our\ncalculation of \u03a3dyn \u221d \u03c3z2 could overestimate the mass of\nthe disk by 20 \u2212 30%.\nIdeally, one would calculate \u03a3dyn by first assuming an\n\n29\n\nisolated disk and then converging to a solution that incorporated the effects of the DM halo. However, we have\nnot done so here for UGC 463 because (1) the random error in our isolated-disk measurements of \u03a3dyn are of the\nsame order as this systematic correction; (2) there is substantial error in our measurement of (\u03c1DM /\u03c1b )z=0 \u223c 0.2,\neven if we adopt the parameterized solutions for \u03c1DM ;\nand (3) there are equally unknown competing systematics that work in the opposite direction, such as the\ninclusion of a massive, razor-thin gas disk. The continued study of the effects of a massive halo on the velocity dispersion, as opposed to just the rotation curve\n(Hayashi & Navarro 2006; Widrow 2008), is worthy of\na dedicated effort. However, given ambiguities regarding\nthe three-dimensional structure of galaxies and the vertical stratification of disks (see discussion in Section 5.6.1),\na detailed understanding of the influence of the DM halo\non the disk is complicated. Here, we simply note that\nthe impact of a relatively massive DM halo in UGC 463\nworks to further lower the maximality of an already submaximal disk.\n6.3.3. Enclosed-Mass Budget\nAs discussed in Paper II, the total baryon fraction\ntot\nFbar = Mtot\nb /Mdyn is ill-defined; however, the surface\ndensity and VDM measurements from Figure 14 allow for\na robust calculation of the enclosed-mass budget to a finite radius, assuming the halo is spherical. The resulting\nmass budget is presented in Table 7 and the mass growth\ncurves are shown in Figure 18. We end the calculation\nat R = 15 kpc (R = 4.2hR ; \u223c R200 /10 for our fitted\nNFW halo), well within the limiting radius of our \u03bc\u2032K\nmeasurements (Figure 2) but extrapolating beyond our\ndynamical data. We calculate the DM mass at 15 kpc using the fitted halo parameterizations and the percentage\nerrors from the measured data. The mass growth curve of\nthe fiducial maximal disk discussed above is overplotted\nin Figure 18 for reference. Although Table 7 only provides the results when assuming a constant \u03a5\u2217,K (R), the\nresults assuming a variable \u03a5\u2217,K (R) are insignificantly\ndifferent.\nFigure 18 shows that the integrated baryonic mass of\nUGC 463 is, at most, equal to the integrated DM mass\nat R \u223c hR . Beyond this radius, the integrated DM mass\nquickly begins to dominate, such that Mb /MDM \u223c 0.3\nat 15 kpc. To the contrary, the integrated mass of the\nfiducial maximal disk always dominates over the DM\nmass; the minimum mass ratio Mdisk /MDM \u223c 1.4 is\nat R = 15 kpc.\n7. SUMMARY\nIn this paper, we have presented a detailed case study\nof the dynamics and implied mass budget of the lowinclination, SABc galaxy UGC 463. We find the galaxy\nto be dominated by DM at nearly all radii, a classification usually reserved for low-surface-brightness galaxies\nwhereas UGC 463 is \u223c 1 magnitude above the Freeman\n(1970) mean central surface brightness (Paper I). The\nstellar disk of UGC 463 is submaximal by a factor of\n& 3 in mass. Submaximal disks have been both indirectly (e.g. Courteau & Rix 1999) or directly (Bottema\n1993; Herrmann & Ciardullo 2009) measured in the past,\nand our results are consistent with these measurements.\n\n\f30\n\nWestfall et al.\n\nFigure 18. Mass growth curves for baryonic mass (solid black\nline), NFW (gray solid line) and pseudo-isothermal (gray dashed\nline) DM halo parameterizations, and the fiducial maximal disk\n(dotted line). The baryonic mass profile assumes a constant\n\u03a5\u2217,K (R); the dark- and light-gray regions represent the random\nand systematic errors, respectively. Individual measurements of\nVDM from Figure 15 are converted to masses assuming a spherical\nhalo and plotted as black triangles; black and gray bars represent\nthe random and systematic errors, respectively.\n\nAt present, this general result should be unaffected by\nsystematic error, despite the albeit large number of assumptions. A summary of our analysis follows.\nOur analysis of UGC 463 draws from nearly all of our\nsurvey data for this galaxy as collectively described in\nSection 2. We derive a distance of D = 59.67\u00b10.01\u00b14.15\nMpc using the flow-corrected systemic velocity and H0 =\n73 \u00b1 5 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 . We derive optical and NIR surface\nbrightness profiles from, respectively, archival SDSS and\n2MASS data; we use the latter to calculate a total Kband magnitude of mK = 9.32 \u00b1 0.02. Our photometry\nis corrected for Galactic extinction; internal extinction\nand dust emission are marginal considerations for our\nresults. We also correct for instrumental smoothing of\nthe surface brightness profile at small radius. Ionized-gas\nand stellar kinematics are derived using SparsePak and\nPPak IFS. Ionized-gas kinematics combine results from\natomic emission lines near H\u03b1 and the [O iii]\u03bb5007 line;\nkinematics are measured using single or double Gaussian\nline fits (as in Andersen et al. 2008). Stellar kinematics\nare derived from absorption lines with rest wavelengths\nbetween \u223c 492 \u2212 522nm using DC3 (Paper III) and a\nsingle K1 III template star (HD 167042 for SparsePak\nand HD 162555 for PPak); template mismatch is . 5%\n(Paper II). All kinematics are corrected for instrumental broadening. We measure H i mass surface densities\nand the H i velocity field using 21cm aperture synthesis\nimaging from the VLA. Finally, we estimate the H2 mass\nsurface density by combining 24\u03bcm Spitzer imaging and a\nI24\u03bcm /ICO \u2206V calibration based on our reanalysis of data\ntabulated by L08. Errors in our measurements of \u03a3H2 incorporate the systematic error in this calibration and the\nerror in our adopted value of XCO = (2.7 \u00b1 0.9) \u00d7 1020\ncm\u22122 (K km s\u22121 )\u22121 .\nIn Section 3, we determine the detailed on-sky geometric projection of the disk of UGC 463, including extensive\ntests of the inclination. These efforts are important to\n\nsubsequent analysis of the measured kinematics due to\nthe substantial influence of inclination errors on the fundamental calculations in this study (Paper II). Inclinations are measured both kinematically - using an algorithm explained in Andersen et al. (2008) that assumes\ncircular motion and a single, coplanar disk - and by\ninverting the TF relations from V01. Kinematic inclinations are most consistent between all ionized-gas and stellar tracers when adopting a \u2202VLOS /\u2202i weighting scheme,\nas explained in Appendix B. We find ikin = 25.\u25e6 1 \u00b1 2.\u25e6 5\nand iTF = 29\u25e6 \u00b1 2\u25e6 ; a combined measurement of i =\n27\u25e6 \u00b1 2\u25e6 represents our best estimate for the inclination\nand is used throughout all subsequent analysis. We derive the dynamical center of each SparsePak observation\nand, for the PPak data, we affix the dynamical center\nto the morphological center determined from a reconstructed continuum map; our two-dimensional maps in\nFigure 1 demonstrate that the dynamical and morphological centers of UGC 463 are identical to within the\nerrors of our measurement (\u223c 1\u2032\u2032 ).\nUsing the derived geometry, we create azimuthally\naveraged kinematics in Section 4. To combine kinematic measurements using different instruments and different wavelength regimes, we apply beam-smearing corrections to both our ionized-gas and stellar kinematics;\nbeam-smearing corrections to the H i data are described\nby Martinsson (2011). The beam-smearing corrections\nemploy model surface-brightness, velocity, and velocitydispersion distributions to create a synthetic dataset that\nis compared to our observations; the corrections are small\n(less than a few percent) except for data near the dynamical center. Figure 7 demonstrates that both the\nionized-gas and stellar kinematics measured separately\nby SparsePak and PPak are very well matched. We provide a cursory assessment of the kinematic axisymmetry of the rotation curves and velocity dispersion profiles by overlaying 180\u25e6 azimuthally averaged kinematics for the receding and approaching sides in Figure 7;\nwith respect to the errors, only moderate differences are\npresent. Therefore, we impose axisymmetry by measuring the gas (ionized+neutral) and stellar velocity and\nvelocity dispersions only as a function of in-plane galaxy\nradius. We correct the gas rotation curve to the circular speed using measurements of \u03c3gas and \u03a3gas following\nDalcanton & Stilp (2010) to produce the axisymmetric\nradial profiles in Figure 8.\nBased on our collection of azimuthally averaged properties, we determine physical properties of the disk of\nUGC 463 in Section 5. We find that the stellar velocity dispersion profile, \u03c3\u2217 (R), has only minor deviations from a pure exponential; the fitted e-folding length\n(h\u03c3 \u223c 2.6hR ) suggests either \u03a5dyn or hz increases by\na factor of \u223c 2.3 over the radial range of our data, if\nthe other quantity is radially invariant. Using the measured circular speed, stellar rotation curve, and stellar\nvelocity dispersion profile, we calculate the observable\nfunction \u03b4AD (R). This function is directly related to the\nshape of the SVE such that we find \u03b1 = 0.48 \u00b1 0.09\nand \u03b2 = 1.04 \u00b1 0.22, when assumed to be constant over\nthe entire disk. Therefore, we find the conversion factors\n\u03c3z /h\u03c3\u2217 i\u03b8 = 0.76\u00b10.09 and \u03c3R /h\u03c3\u2217 i\u03b8 = 1.59\u00b10.17, which\nwe use in our calculations of \u03a3dyn and the disk stability,\nQ. Our calculations of \u03a3dyn (Figure 10) use equation 9\nfrom Paper II, which assumes the oblateness from their\n\n\fThe DiskMass Survey. IV.\nequation 1. We find \u03a3dyn is well fit by 3\u03a3gas , from which\nit follows that \u03a3\u2217 \u223c 2\u03a3gas . Using \u03a3gas , \u03c3gas , \u03a3\u2217 , and \u03c3R ,\nwe calculate individual and multi-component stability\ncoefficients following from, respectively, Toomre (1964)\nand Rafikov (2001). We find the disk to be globally stable, with the multi-component stability asymptotically\ndecreasing with radius to a value of QR \u223c 2. Based on\ncombining stability arguments with swing-amplification\ntheory (Toomre 1981; Athanassoula et al. 1987), disks\nof a fixed rotation curve should exhibit higher spiral-arm\nmultiplicity when the disk mass is decreased. This expectation is qualitatively consistent with our measurements\nof a submaximal disk and three-arm multiplicity in UGC\n463; however, Paper V and Martinsson (2011) find submaximal disks regardless of spiral-arm multiplicity.\n\u2032\ndisk\nWe calculate \u03a5disk\n\u2217,K using \u03a3\u2217 and \u03bcK to find h\u03a5\u2217,K i =\n+0.16\n0.22 \u00b1 0.09\u22120.15 M\u2299 /LK\n\u2299 at R > 2 kpc. Our measurements of h\u03a5disk\n\u2217,K i are systematically lower than SPS model\npredictions (\u03a5SPS\n\u2217,K ) from B03 by a factor of \u223c 3.6 and\nlarger than the SPS modeling of Z09 by a factor of \u223c 1.8.\nBased on an MC sampling of probability distributions\nassigned to each quantity in the calculation, we generate a composite (random+systematic error) probability\ndisk\ndistribution for \u03a5disk\n\u2217,K (R) and h\u03a5\u2217,K i. We find that the\nZ09 prediction are within our 68% confidence interval for\ndisk\nh\u03a5disk\n\u2217,K i; in contrast, measurements of h\u03a5\u2217,K i consistent\nwith the B03 prediction occur for less than 1 in 105 MC\nsamples. Z09 attribute the disparity between their \u03a5SPS\n\u2217,K\npredictions and those from B03 to different treatments of\nthe star-formation history and TP-AGB phases of stellar\nevolution. We also find a factor of \u223c 2 increase in \u03a5disk\n\u2217,K\nwith radius, which is not predicted by the SPS modeling.\nThis feature may reflect a true increase in the \u03a5disk\n\u2217,K , a\nflaring of the stellar disk, or a change in the relative dynamical influence of the halo, thick stellar disk, and/or\nrazor-thin gas disk.\nWe discuss the mass budget of UGC 463 out to 15 kpc\n(4.2 hR ) in Section 6 using a traditional rotation-curve\nmass decomposition, which benefits from our unique and\ndirect measurement of \u03a5disk\n\u2217,K . Our primary discussion assumes a constant \u03a5\u2217,K (R) = h\u03a5disk\n\u2217,K i; however, we also\nbriefly discuss results obtained by assuming a variable\n\u03a5\u2217,K (R) = \u03a5disk\n\u2217,K (R). Our mass decomposition also assumes that hz is constant with radius and that the galaxy\nis composed of four separable potentials (halo, stellar\nbulge, stellar disk, and gas disk). The total mass budget\nobtained by assuming a constant \u03a5\u2217,K (R) is provided in\nTable 7; assuming a variable \u03a5\u2217,K (R) produces results\nthat are statistically identical.\nWe calculate the circular speed of each baryonic component in Section 6.1. We find that a maximal disk\nmay be produced by adopting the \u03a5SPS\n\u2217,K prediction from\nB03, which amounts to increasing the stellar (baryonic)\nmass by a factor of 3.6 (2.7) above our measurements of\nh\u03a5disk\n\u2217,K i. However, this result is effectively excluded by\nour simultaneous measurements of Vc and \u03c3\u2217 . Using our\n2\ndynamical measurements, we produce VDM\n= Vc2 \u2212 Vb2\nand use these measurements to calculate \u03c1DM ; both VDM\nand \u03c1DM assume a spherical halo. In Section 6.2, we\nfit VDM with an NFW and pseudo-isothermal DM halo,\n\n31\n\nand we find both to be statistically suitable descriptions\nof our measurements. The concentration of the NFW\nhalo is consistent with expectations from DM-only simulations, implying that the halo structure has been relatively unaffected by the collapsed baryons. Our measurements of \u03c1DM show a slope that may be steeper than both\n\u03c1DM \u221d 1/R and the slope predicted by either DM-halo\nparameterization; however, this result is highly dependent on the error-prone assessment of the baryonic mass\nwithin the central kpc. Results for additional galaxies in\nour Phase-B sample are required to place better statistical constraints on the shape of DM halos of local disk\ngalaxies.\nWe discuss the dominant gravitational influence of DM\nover baryonic matter in UGC 463 in Section 6.3, as\nsummarized in Tables 7 and 8. Assuming a constant\n\u03a5\u2217,K (R), we find the baryonic disk to be substantially\n+0.12\nsubmaximal with Fb (2.2hR ) = 0.61+0.07\n\u22120.09 \u22120.18 . Considering only the stellar disk and adopting F\u2217disk (2.2hR ) =\n0.85 \u00b1 0.10 as the definition of a maximal disk (Sackett\n1997), UGC 463 is submaximal by a factor of \u223c\n(0.85/0.46)2 = 3.4 in mass, consistent with our expectation based on the difference between h\u03a5disk\n\u2217,K i and the\nSPS\n\u03a5\u2217,K prediction from B03 (Section 6.1). We also compare our measurements of the baryonic component to a\nfiducial maximal disk (having Fdisk (2.2hR ) = 0.85) resulting from embedding a purely exponential disk (with\nhR and hz as measured for UGC 463) in our fitted NFW\nand pseudo-isothermal DM halos. In the disk mid-plane,\nwe find the ratio (\u03c1DM /\u03c1b )z=0 is a factor of five larger\nthan expected by our fiducial maximal disk, which may\nlead to an overestimate of \u03a3dyn . Additionally, we find\nthat the enclosed-mass of the galaxy is dominated by\nDM at R & hR , whereas the fiducial maximal disk dominates the enclosed-mass budget at all radii sampled by\nour observations. Finally, assuming a constant \u03a5\u2217,K (R),\nwe find a baryonic-to-DM mass ratio of 0.31 \u00b1 0.8+0.16\n\u22120.14\nfor the mass enclosed within the central 15 kpc.\nAlthough our results are for a single galaxy, an analysis of 30 galaxies in our sample demonstrate that all\nof these disks are comparably submaximal (Paper V;\nMartinsson 2011). One can increase the maximality of\nthese disks by changing the assumptions concerning the\nvertical mass distribution (quantified by the constant k)\nor the applied oblateness (q), as discussed in Sections 5.3\nand 5.6.1; however, k and q would have to take on values\nthat are effectively excluded by empirical constraints on\nthe structural parameters of disk galaxies based on edgeon systems (e.g., Kregel 2003). The recalibration of \u03a5\u2217\nbased on these results has significant consequences for,\ne.g., our understanding of the baryonic mass of galaxies\nas a function of redshift and for the gravitational interplay between baryonic and dark matter in the process of\ngalaxy formation.\nSupport for this work was provided by the National\nScience Foundation (NSF) via grants AST-0307417 and\nAST-0607516 (M.A.B., K.B.W., and A.S.-R.), OISE0754437 (K.B.W.), and AST-1009491 (M.A.B. and A.S.R.).

SURFACE-BRIGHTNESS CALIBRATION AND INTERPOLATION OF IFU DATA\n\nThe spectral-continuum surface-brightness maps in the H\u03b1 and Mg i regions shown in Figure 1 are calibrated against\nSDSS imaging data, assuming that the dynamical center (Table 6) is the same as the morphological center.\nThe \"model\" flux in fiber f measured from the CCD data is\nCmod,f = dlog [0.4(Zfib \u2212 ZCCD ) + log ICCD,f ] Afib \u2212 Sfib ,\n\n(A1)\n\nwhere Z represents a magnitude zero-point and ICCD,f = (CCCD,f \u2212 SCCD )/ACCD represents the surface brightness in\nunits of DN arcsec\u22122 - determined by the total flux (C) within an aperture (of area A) with a sky background (S).\n2\nThe fiber aperture area, ACCD \u223c Afib \u2261 \u03c0Dfib\n/4, is known and the quantities related to the CCD image are measured\nor provided by the SDSS calibration. The fiber-continuum zero-point, Zfib , and sky-level, Sfib , are free parameters;\nSfib is fiber independent, adjusting\nthe nominal\ncorrection based on the average sky spectrum. Equation A1 is fit to\np\np\nour IFS data by minimizing ( Cfib,f \u2212 Cmod,f )2 , where Cfib,f is the mean flux across the full spectral range; data\nwith erroneous negative flux are ignored. We also limit the radial region considered to avoid inflated errors were the\nsky subtraction of the IFS is particularly problematic due to variations in the sky flux as measured by the dedicated\nsky fibers.\nWe use the SDSS g-band (1.\u2032\u2032 5 seeing) and r-band (1.\u2032\u2032 2 seeing) data to calibrate the Mg i-region and H\u03b1-region\nIFS, respectively. For the PPak data, analysis of guide-camera images taken throughout each exposure show that\nthe average seeing was 1.\u2032\u2032 7 (Martinsson 2011); therefore, we match this seeing by applying a Gaussian kernel with a\nFWHM of 0.\u2032\u2032 8 to the g-band image when fitting to the PPak data. No such seeing measurements are available for the\nSparsePak data. Although we have allowed the seeing to be a fitted parameter for SparsePak, seeing measurements\nwere non-convergent in the sense that there appears to be no substantial difference with the inherent seeing of the\nSDSS images. This is not surprising given the image quality quartiles at WIYN and the large SparsePak fibers.\nThe final calibration results are provided in Figure 19 for all data. We mark each panel by the pointing number and\ninclude the residual RMS within the fitting region. The RMS values are typically 0.2 magnitudes, and the PPak data\n\n\f34\n\nWestfall et al.\n\nFigure 19. Photometric calibration of the IFS fiber continuum flux. Three panel groups are shown: the results for the four H\u03b1 02Jan02\nSparsePak pointings, the results for the three H\u03b1 20Oct02 pointings, and the results for the two Mg i pointings - one from SparsePak and\nthe other from PPak. Each group has two columns, overlaying the calibrated fiber fluxes (black) on the measured aperture photometry\nfrom the SDSS images (gray) to the left and plotting the residual, \u2206\u03bc = \u03bcfib \u2212 \u03bcCCD , to the right. Radial regions not considered during\nthe calibration process are shaded gray. The pointing number or instrument is provide in the upper-right corner of the left-column panels,\nand the RMS of the residuals are displayed in the upper-left corner of the right-column panels.\n\nhave the smallest residual at 0.1 magnitudes. Fits using no additional seeing for the SparsePak data demonstrate good\nagreement with the direct-imaging data at small radii, implying that the systematic errors due to an inappropriate\nseeing match between the SDSS images and the SparsePak IFS are inconsequential. The results shown in Figure 19\nare used to produce calibrated fluxes that are interpolated and converted to surface brightness for Figure 1.\nThe interpolation of the continuum fluxes and kinematics from our IFS is performed to fill interstitial fiber regions\naccording to the following algorithm: Each kinematic measurement contributes to every pixel in the image, weighted\nby a two-dimensional Gaussian function centered on the fiber aperture with a FWHM equal to a multiple of the\neffective fiber diameter, Dfib , and inversely weighted by the measurement error; therefore, each image pixel is weighted\nboth by the quality and proximity of the surrounding fiber measurements. Mathematically, the weight of each fiber f\nat pixel coordinate (j,k) is, therefore,\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1\n\u2212(xj \u2212 xf )2 \u2212 (yk \u2212 yf )2\nwf (j, k) = 2 exp\n,\n(A2)\n\u01ebf\n(nDfib /2)2 / ln 2\nwhere \u01ebf is the measurement error, (xj , yk ) are the on-sky coordinates of pixel (j,k), the fiber center has on-sky\ncoordinates (xf , yf ), and nDfib is the FWHM of the circular Gaussian in multiples of the fiber diameter. Calibrated\ncontinuum fluxes include no additional error weighting (\u01ebf is constant for all f ). The interpolated value at each\npixel is then the weighted average, over all fibers, of the continuum value or kinematic measurement in question.\nFor presentation purposes, we limit the interpolation to only those regions with a \"significant\" contribution to the\ninterpolated map. For Figure 1, we adopt the following representation of \"significant:\"\nNf\nX\n\nf =1\n\nwf (j, k) \u2265\n\ny \u22121 Nf\nNx \u22121 NX\nX\nwmin X\nwf (j, k),\nNx Ny j=0\n\nk=0\n\nf =1\n\n(A3)\n\n\fThe DiskMass Survey.

That is, the summed weight of all fibers to a given pixel\nmust be greater than wmin times the mean of all weights across the entire image. This scheme is not ideal given the\ndependence between the inclusion of an interpolated value and the arbitrary size of the image; however, it can provide\nreasonable results as demonstrated by Figure 1.

OPTIMAL WEIGHTING SCHEME FOR KINEMATIC INCLINATION MEASUREMENTS\n\nIn velocity-field modeling, parameter robustness and covariance can be, respectively, improved and mitigated by\nintroducing data-weighting schemes. For example, Begeman (1989) introduced a cosine weighting scheme, effectively\nweighting each datum by the derivative of the model LOS velocity with respect to the projected rotation velocity,\nproj\nw = \u2202VLOS /\u2202Vrot\n= cos \u03b8, thereby limiting the covariance between Vrot and i. Andersen & Bershady (2003) mitigate\nthis same covariance by instead fitting the projected rotation curve directly. Here, we consider an optimal weighting\nscheme for measuring the kinematic inclination of UGC 463 according to the approach described in Section 3.1.1.\nproj\nAndersen & Bershady (2003) parameterized Vrot\n(R) by a hyperbolic tangent function and adopted a velocity-error\nweighting scheme, producing a face-on TF relation that is well matched to samples of more inclined systems. Their\nerror-weighting scheme combines, in quadrature, the measured velocity error with a \"beam-smearing error\" and a\n\"stochastic error.\" The beam-smearing error is based on a fiber-by-fiber measurement of the variance in VLOS within\nthe fiber aperture, thereby reducing the effect of patchy emission on the fit. The stochastic error is a single error\nassessed for every velocity measurement that reduces the influence of small-scale, incoherent non-circular motions on\nthe fit.\nHere, we are primarily concerned with fitting inclination such that we test the success/failure of a given weighting\nfunction, as applied to UGC 463, via the correspondence/disparity of the inclinations determined from each of three\ntracers: (1) H\u03b1 from SparsePak, iH\u03b1 ; (2) [O iii] from PPak, i[O iii] ; and (3) stars from PPak, i\u2217 . We apply four\nweighting schemes: In addition to the error-based and cos \u03b8 schemes described above, we include uniform weighting\nand a weighting scheme defined by w = \u2202VLOS /\u2202i. The latter scheme affords those data with greater leverage on the\nfitted inclination a greater influence on the goodness-of-fit statistic.\nWe omit data from consideration in our goodness-of-fit statistic in two steps. First, we omit all data with velocity\nerrors that are greater than 15 km s\u22121 , eliminating 0.5%, 0%, and 1.0% of the SparsePak H\u03b1, PPak [O iii], and PPak\nstellar data, respectively. We note here that, after applying this omission, the mean velocity measurement errors\nare 1, 3, and 6 km s\u22121 for the SparsePak H\u03b1, PPak [O iii], and PPak stellar data, respectively. Second, we omit\nhighly discrepant velocities by first fitting the data using the error weighting scheme and omitting data at high \u03c72 .\nData are iteratively omitted while adjusting the model and the stochastic error until the error-weighted distribution\nof the data about the model follows a nominal Gaussian (Westfall 2009); in practice, no points are omitted with\n\u03c72 = (V \u2212 Vm )2 /\u01eb(V )2 < 10. This omission stategy does not bias our results toward, e.g., the initial guess parameters\nof the fit; instead, it serves to eliminate a \u03c72 -optimization bias driven by a few, highly discrepant measurements.\nApplying this procedure to our UGC 463 data eliminates an additional 11.6%, 14.0%, and 5.2% of the SparsePak\nH\u03b1, PPak [O iii], and PPak stellar data, respectively. As described in Section 3.1.1, all velocity-field parameters are\nsimultaneously fit to the remaining data with the dynamical center of the PPak data fixed to the morphological center.\nIdentical data sets are fit by each weighting scheme for each tracer, and we use a set of 500 bootstrap simulations\n(see Section 15.6.2 of Press et al. 2007) to determine the probability distribution for each fitted parameter. The errorweighted standard deviations of the velocities about the best-fitting models are typically 5, 6, and 7 km s\u22121 for the\nSparsePak H\u03b1, PPak [O iii], and PPak stellar data, respectively, with only small (5 \u2212 10%) variations among results\nreached using the different weighting schemes.\nFigure 20 provides the bootstrap-based probability distributions and growth curves for the inclinations measured\nby each weighting scheme and each tracer; the best-fit inclination and the 68% confidence limits are tabulated in the\nFigure. For UGC 463, we find that weighting by \u2202VLOS /\u2202i produces inclination distributions that are the most similar\nbetween the three kinematic tracers. This is, therefore, the weighting scheme we have adopted in Section 3.1.1 to\nmeasure ikin . For all results except those based on the error-weighting scheme, the error-weighted mean of iH\u03b1 , i[O iii] ,\nand i\u2217 is compatible with our final adopted inclination of i = 27\u25e6 \u00b1 2\u25e6 to better than the errors.\n\n\f36\n\nWestfall et al.\n\nFigure 20.
