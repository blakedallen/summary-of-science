In quiescence, SGRs have been found\nto exhibit persistent X-ray luminosities of \u223c1035 ergs s\u22121 . Three SGRs emit coherent pulsations\nbetween 5 and 8 s (Kouveliotou et al. 1998; Hurley et al. 1999a; Kulkarni et al. 2003), and all\nare spinning down rapidly with time (Kouveliotou et al. 1998, 1999, Kulkarni et al. 2003). The\nspindown observed in two of these SGRs (1806\u221220 and 1900+14) is not constant. Furthermore,\nmost of the spindown variations do not directly correlate with the bursting activity of the source\n(Woods et al. 2002).\nThe rapid spindown in SGRs has been interpreted (e.g. Kouveliotou et al. 1998) as magnetic\nbraking of a strongly magnetized neutron star with Bdip \u223c 1014 \u2212 1015 G, or magnetar (Thompson\n& Duncan 1995, 1996). The magnetar model postulates that the short duration SGR bursts are\ntriggered by starquakes induced by magnetic stresses in the neutron star crust (Thompson &\nDuncan 1995) or perhaps magnetic reconnection events in the stellar magnetosphere (Lyutikov\n2002). Persistent magnetospheric currents, driven by twists in the evolving magnetic field, and\nfield decay in the stellar interior contribute to the quiescent flux from SGRs (Thompson & Duncan\n1996; Thompson, Lyutikov & Kulkarni 2002).\nBurst activity in SGRs occurs sporadically in time and the separation between successive\nevents can vary from seconds to years. Epochs when SGRs are emitting several bursts or burst\nactive phases vary in both intensity and duration. For example, SGR 1900+14 was discovered in\n1979 when it was observed to burst only 3 times in 3 days (Mazets & Golenetskii 1981). In 1992,\nthe source became active again for a few days and emitted a handful of events (Kouveliotou et\nal. 1993); it entered an unprecedented level of activity in 1998 (Hurley et al. 1999b) never before\nobserved for any SGR. During the course of 9 months, more than 1000 bursts were recorded from\nthis source with various instruments (G\u00f6\u011f\u00fc\u015f et al. 1999).\nThe pinnacle of the 1998 activity of SGR 1900+14 was realized on August 27 when a giant\nflare was recorded from this source (Hurley et al. 1999c; Mazets et al. 1999; Feroci et al. 1999,\n2000). The event reached a peak luminosity of \u223c4 \u00d7 1044 ergs s\u22121 and persisted for over \u223c6 minutes\nreleasing a total of \u223c1044 ergs in gamma-rays >15 keV. The flare started with a spectrally hard,\nnon-thermal initial spike that was followed by a softer tail which decayed in a quasi-exponential\nmanner. Superimposed on the decaying tail were coherent 5.16 s pulsations whose shape evolved\nwith time. Eighteen minutes after the termination of the gamma-ray emission, a bright X-ray\ntail from SGR 1900+14 was detected that decayed in time as a power-law (Woods et al. 2001).\nThe change in pulse profile observed during the August 27 flare at gamma-ray energies was also\nevident in the persistent X-ray emission pulse profile seen before and after the flare (Woods et\nal. 2001; G\u00f6\u011f\u00fc\u015f et al. 2002). In addition, a transient radio outburst was seen for the first and\nonly time from an SGR source, due to a sudden outflow of material associated with this flare\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n(Frail, Kulkarni & Bloom 1999). Finally, there is strong circumstantial evidence which indicates\nthat there was a brief, albeit substantial spin-down event (\u2206P = 5.72(14) \u00d7 10\u22124 s [Woods et al.\n1999b]) within the hours following the flare (Palmer et al. 2001), due perhaps to this large outflow\nof material (Thompson et al. 2000).\nOn 2001 April 18, a burst was detected from SGR 1900+14 with a high energy (\u223c1043 ergs)\nand long duration \u223c40 s (Guidorzi et al. 2001). Unlike the August 27 flare, there was no intense,\nnon-thermal emission episode at the onset of this event (Guidorzi et al. in preparation). The\nenergy released by this flare was less than the giant flare of August 27, yet much larger than\na typical SGR event and was consequently dubbed an \"intermediate flare\" (Kouveliotou et al.\n2001). Several, more common SGR bursts were detected during the following weeks. We triggered\na sequence of ToO observations of the source with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) and\nthe Satellite per Astronomia X (BeppoSAX) over the two weeks following the April 18 event. Here,\nwe present pulse timing and profile results from these observations. The flux history during this\nepoch is discussed in the accompanying paper (Feroci et al. 2003).\n\n2.\n\nObservations\n\nThe ToO observations of SGR 1900+14 with the RXTE Proportional Counter Array (PCA)\nbegan \u223c34 hours after the intermediate flare and continued for the next two weeks. A total of 128\nks of data were collected during 13 pointings. A single monitoring observation (10 ks exposure\ntime) of SGR 1900+14 was serendipitously performed on 2001 April 14, just 4 days prior to the\nflare.\nWe find no burst activity during the pre-flare observation on 2001 April 14. We performed\na search through the data following the flare and found a total of 32 bursts that exceeded\n5.5\u03c3 above background (using a running mean) on the 0.125 s time scale. The last burst from\nSGR 1900+14 detected in the PCA data was recorded on 2001 May 1 at 04:00:22 UT. On 2001\nApril 28, we noted a sudden increase in the intensity of SGR 1900+14 between consecutive RXTE\norbits. We determined that this flux increase was associated with another high fluence burst\nfrom SGR 1900+14 recorded by instruments aboard Ulysses and Konus while the source was\nEarth-occulted for RXTE. A detailed analysis of this event is presented elsewhere (Lenters et al.\n2003).\nTwo observations of SGR 1900+14 were performed with the BeppoSAX Narrow Field\nInstruments (NFI) during the April 2001 activation of the source. The first commenced \u223c8 hours\nafter the intermediate flare and the second observation took place \u223c12 days later. The source\nexposure times for the two Medium Energy Concentrator Spectrometer (MECS) units were 34.8\nand 57.3 ks, respectively. A more detailed account of the NFI observations are presented in Feroci\net al. (2003).\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n3.\n\nPulse Timing Analysis\n\nThe PCA data from each observation were first filtered to remove the 32 detected bursts by\neliminating all data prior to and following each burst by 1 s. The data were then energy selected\n(2\u22125 keV) to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio and allow for a comparison to the BeppoSAX\nNFI data. The data were binned to 0.125 s time resolution and transformed to the Solar system\nbarycenter using the ftool faxbary. Next, we generated Lomb-Scargle power spectra (Lomb 1976)\nto determine coarse frequencies for each set of observations.\nThe BeppoSAX MECS data were filtered for bursts by first binning the source region event\ntimes into a histogram having 0.5 s time resolution and calculating the normalized Poisson\nprobabilities for each bin. Bins having probabilities less than 1 \u00d7 10\u22123 (\u223c7 counts) were identified\nas bursts and events recorded during those times (\u00b11 s) were removed from the subsequent\nanalysis. As with the PCA data, we energy selected our event list to only include photons with\nenergies 2\u22125 keV. The event times were transformed to the solar-system barycenter using the\nSAXDAS tool baryconv.\nAll data following the flare were folded on a single frequency determined by the highest\npeak in the Lomb-Scargle power spectrum and a phase was calculated for each set relative to a\ntemplate profile (generated from a subset of PCA observations when the source was brightest).\nWe found significant curvature in the phase residuals, indicative of spin-down. The phases were\nfit to a second order polynomial and a new template was generated from the full data set. This\nprocedure was iterated and the final second-order polynomial fit yielded a \u03c72 = 20.8 for 26 degrees\nof freedom. Using the combined RXTE and BeppoSAX data sets, we measure a frequency and\nfrequency derivative of 0.193317095(15) Hz and \u22126.56(9) \u00d7 10\u221212 Hz s\u22121 , respectively (epoch\n= 52023.0 MJD TDB). The combined data set spans the time range MJD 52017.68\u221252034.01\n(Figure 1). The spindown rate measured here is more rapid than the spindown observed following\nthe giant flare of 1998 August 27 (Woods et al. 1999b) by a factor \u223c2.9.\nWe next extrapolated our fit to the time of the PCA observation that preceded the April 18\nflare by four days. Using the full covariance matrix from our fit to the post-flare phases, the model\nuncertainty in the predicted phase at the time of the pre-flare observation is \u00b10.027 cycles. We find\nthat the relative phase measured for this observation is discrepant from the model ephemeris by\n\u223c0.24 cycles or 4.1\u03c3. The frequency during this brief observation, however, is poorly determined\nso we cannot rule out the existence of cycle slips between April 14 and April 18 which would only\nincrease the phase discrepancy (e.g. the phase difference could be -1.76, -0.76, 0.24, 1.24, cycles,\netc.). The disagreement of our phase measurement on April 14 suggests that the source suffered\natiming anomaly, however, the absence of a precise frequency measurement on April 14 precludes\nus from determining the manner in which the spin evolution deviated. Therefore, it is not possible\nto place a meaningful quantitative limit on any hypothetical glitch coincident with or following\nthe April 18 flare.\nPalmer (2001) noted that the gamma-ray pulsations (15\u2212150 keV) during the 1998 August\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n\nFig. 1.- Top \u2013 Pulse phases (PCA, MECS, and GRBM) during the April activation of\nSGR 1900+14 minus a linear trend.

He noted that this mis-alignment could be either due to a strong energy\ndependence of the pulse profile or the consequence of rapid spin-down during the minutes or hours\nfollowing the flare as was deduced earlier from the spin history of the source (Woods et al. 1999).\nUsing the GRBM data from BeppoSAX, we performed a similar analysis for the April 18 flare.\nThe GRBM bin times were converted to the solar-system barycenter to within the absolute time\naccuracy of the GRBM clock (\u223c10 ms or 0.002 cycles). Using the spin ephemeris determined\nabove, we calculated the phase of each GRBM time bin. The model uncertainty in the phase at\nthe time of the flare is 0.001 cycles. The detrended flare data are plotted along with the folded\n(2\u22125 keV) PCA X-ray profile (Figure 2). Unlike the August 27 flare, we find good agreement in\nthe occurrence in phase of the peak in the pulse profile between the X-ray and gamma-ray bands.\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n\nFig. 2.- Top \u2013 The detrended GRBM lightcurve of the April 18 flare from SGR 1900+14 (40\u2212700\nkeV) transformed from time to rotational phase of the star. Bottom \u2013 The 2\u22125 keV pulse profile\nfrom PCA data acquired during the two weeks following this flare folded on the same ephemeris\nand repeated here ten times. Note the good agreement in the phase of the peak between X-rays\nand gamma-rays. The vertical dotted lines denotes the centroid of the pulse peak in X-rays.\n\nWe next quantified the alignment of the gamma-ray to X-ray pulsations. We chose not to\ncross-correlate the profiles as was done for the X-ray data alone due to the modest, yet significant\ndifferences in pulse shapes between the X-ray and gamma-ray bands. Instead, we chose to fit the\npeak of each pulse profile to a quadratic and compare the centroids of the gamma-ray pulsations\nto the X-ray pulse train. We fit the peak of the X-ray profile to the quadratic and measured its\nphase. Before centroid fitting the gamma-ray pulsations, we removed the burst envelope using\na low-pass digital filter. We identified eight local maxima in the filtered gamma-ray lightcurve\n(labeled above and to the left of each maximum in Figure 2). We fit pulses 1 through 7 to the\nquadratic function and measured their phases relative to the X-ray profile. To check the validity\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nof our filtering procedure, we fit the unfiltered pulse maxima and found that only peak 1 changed\nsignificantly. Peak 1 is found during the rapid and jagged rise of the flare where our filter could not\nreliably subtract the burst envelope from the pulse. We therefore omitted the phase measurement\nof pulse 1. The local maximum 8 occurs after the primary burst envelope (encompassing pulses\n1\u22127) returns to background. We interpret this as a separate burst event, and not a pulse. The\ndistinction between this event and the other pulses is more apparent when viewing the unfiltered\nlightcurve (Guidorzi et al. in preparation). We find that the six remaining gamma-ray pulsations\narrive systematically earlier in phase between 0.041 and 0.093 cycles. The average phase lag is\n\u223c0.063 cycles or 23\u25e6 (denoted by the triangle in Figure 1). We conclude that there are only minor\nchanges in the pulse profile with both energy (2\u2212 \u223c100 keV) and luminosity (1035 \u2212 1042 ergs\ns\u22121 ). Another consequence of the relatively good agreement between the X-ray ephemeris and the\ngamma-ray pulsations implies that there was no sudden spindown following the April 18 flare of\nthe magnitude and type inferred for the August 27 flare.\n\n4.\n\nPulse Profile and Fraction\n\nThe X-ray pulse profile (2\u22125 keV) is quite simple showing a single, nearly sinusoidal peak.\nWe investigated the evolution of the pulse shape with energy by extracting profiles in different\nenergy bands. To expand the range to lower photon energies, we also included data from Chandra\nAdvanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) observations (Kouveliotou et al. 2001) performed\nduring this epoch. We find no significant energy dependence within the X-ray band (0.5\u221220 keV).\nComparison of the X-ray profile with the gamma-ray profile seen during the burst shows that he\npulse shapes are similar, but not identical. The primary gamma-ray peak is narrower than the\nX-ray pulse peak and a secondary maximum is seen at gamma-ray energies between peaks.\nIt was shown previously (Woods et al. 2001) that the dramatic change in pulse profile found\nwithin the gamma-ray tail of the August 27 flare manifested itself within the persistent X-ray pulse\nprofile as well. We searched for changes in the X-ray pulse profile by comparing with observations\nfrom the PCA in the year 2000. The folded pulse profiles for the year 2000 and the April 2001\nactivation are shown in Figure 3. Comparing the two pulse shapes using a \u03c72 test, we find that\nthe profiles are different at a confidence level of 99.7%. Specifically, the rise to pulse maximum is\nfaster in the year 2000 profile and the decline is faster in the April 2001 profile. We note that the\nphase discrepancy of April 14 (>0.24\ncycles) cannot be accounted for by the difference in shape\n\u223c\nbetween these pulse profiles. A more detailed investigation of the energy and temporal dependence\nof SGR pulse profiles is presented in G\u00f6\u011f\u00fc\u015f et al. (2002).\nWe next measured the pulse fraction following the April 18 flare using the data from the\ntwo imaging telescopes, the BeppoSAX (SAX) MECS and Chandra (CXO) ACIS detectors. We\nmeasure 2\u221210 keV rms pulse fractions of 18.1(10)%, 16.3(11)%, 13.6(15)%, and 12.9(12)% for\nthe respective epochs of MJD TDB 52018.113 (SAX), 52021.324 (CXO), 52029.591 (SAX), and\n52030.092 (CXO). Note that the measured CXO pulse fractions differ slightly from those reported\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\n\nFig. 3.- The folded pulse profile of SGR 1900+14 in 2\u221210 keV X-rays as seen with the PCA\nduring the year 2000 (left) and during the two weeks following the April 18 flare (right).\n\nin Kouveliotou et al. (2001), who reported the pulse fractions in the 0.5\u22127.0 keV energy range.\nThe pulse fraction of SGR 1900+14 increases significantly following the April 18 flare and during\nthe subsequent 11 days, slowly declines, approaching its quiescent value.\nWe have also studied the pulse fraction evolution with energy. The known temporal evolution\nof the pulse fraction restricted our study to contemporaneous observations (i.e. we could only\nsearch for changes within individual observations). We find no significant evolution of the pulse\nfraction with energy (0.5\u221210 keV) within the individual BeppoSAX and Chandra observations,\nalthough our limits are not very strong (<\n\u223c 25% at 95% confidence).\n\n5.\n\nDiscussion\n\nWe have observed a good phase alignment, and similarity in pulse morphology, between the\nbright gamma-ray emission (>15 keV) during the April 18 flare, and the much fainter X-ray\nemission (0.5\u221210 keV) following the flare. These observations have interesting implications for\nthe source of the dissipation, and the mechanism that shapes the pulse profile, in these two very\ndifferent states of SGR 1900+14 \u2013 which differ by more than a factor of 106 in luminosity.\nThe pulse maximum in these two states is apparently produced at the same geometric location\non (or above) the surface of the neutron star. In the magnetar model, this means either that the\nbursting and persistent emission are emanating from the same region close to the star; or that the\nangular pattern of the X-ray/gamma-ray emission is being modified in a similar way by resonant\n(electron) cyclotron scattering high in the magnetosphere. By themselves, the observations of the\n2001 April flare and post-flare pulsations cannot distinguish between these two models. However,\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nthe pulse profile of SGR 1900+14 showed significant changes during the 1998 burst activation.\nCombining these earlier observations with the measurements of the April 2001 activity, we can\nbegin to constrain the underyling physics.\nThere were gross changes in both the gamma-ray pulse morphology at high luminosity during\nthe 1998 August 27 flare, and in the much fainter X-ray pulsations observed before and after this\nflare. On that basis, we argued that the magnetic field of SGR 1900+14 was reconfigured during\nthe August 27 flare (Woods et al. 2001). During the tail of that flare, the luminosity exceeded the\nEddington luminosity by as much as a factor of 10,000, which allows a substantial optical depth\nto accumulate in material blown off the surface of the star (Thompson and Duncan 1995). It was\nargued that the outburst was driven by the relaxation of a non-axisymmetric magnetic field close\nto the star, which channeled the outflow of material and created anisotropies in the opacity high\nin the magnetosphere (Feroci et al. 2001; Thompson & Duncan 2001). The change in pulse profile\nduring the flare was proposed to be due to the contraction and simplification in topology of a hot\nfireball powering the gamma-ray emission during the tail.\nA corresponding simplification was observed in the persistent X-ray pulse profile \u2013 from a\nmulti-peaked shape pre-flare to a nearly sinusoidal profile post-flare (Woods et al. 2001). In\nthis much lower luminosity state, it was hypothesized that the external magnetic field of the\nstar retains a significant non-potential component, and that the associated electrical currents\npower the continuing non-thermal X-ray emission (Thompson, Lyutikov & Kulkarni 2002). This\nmodel implies a significant optical depth to resonant cyclotron scattering, which is independent\nof frequency in the simplest case of a self-similar and axisymmetric magnetosphere. The optical\ndepth to scattering has a maximum at the magnetic equator, and drops smoothly toward the\nmagnetic pole. Resonant scattering of X-rays (2\u221210 keV) by electrons would take place far enough\nfrom the surface of a magnetar (\u223c 5 \u2212 10 R\u22c6 ) that the poloidal magnetic field would be almost\ndipolar \u2013 hence the simplified X-ray pulse shape observed in all observations of the persistent\nemission since the August 27 flare. In the simplest case, this \"scattering screen\" was activated\nat the onset of the giant flare when most of the energy was deposited into the magnetosphere.\nBecause the quiescent X-ray spectrum was non-thermal even before the flare, it was suggested\nthat the outer magnetosphere of SGR 1900+14 was already twisted, and made a transition from a\nnon-axisymmetric to an axisymmetric configuration during the flare (Thompson et al. 2002). It\nshould be emphasized that, in this model, the mechanism for supplying the scattering screen is\ndifferent in the high and low luminosity states. Moreover, the field geometry close to the star can\nremain quite complicated even after the flare.\nWe now consider the observations of the 2001 April activation of SGR 1900+14 within the\nframework of the model outlined above for the August 27 flare. The presence of a scattering\nscreen in the outer magnetosphere provides a possible explanation for the phase alignment of the\npulse maxima between outburst and quiescence. (The optical depth in the screen is smallest along\nthe magnetic pole, which can be assumed to have a fixed orientation with respect to the body of\nthe star.) However, the pulse profiles in the April 18 and August 27 flares are grossly different\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nin the same energy band, in spite of having similar luminosities. During an outburst, the optical\ndepth in the screen can be temporarily augmented by ionized matter blown off the surface of\nstar and channeled along the magnetic field.13 As a result, one must postulate that the flux of\nmaterial reaching a distance of 50\u2212100 km was much more irregular during the August 27 flare\nthan it was during the April 18 flare (whose energy was an order of magnitude lower [Guidorzi et\nal. 2001]). Matter and radiation interact in a complicated way in the part of the magnetosphere\nwhere electrons and X-rays are resonantly coupled (Thompson et al. 2002), and more detailed\nwork is required to determine if this supposition is reasonable.\nAn unattractive feature of this model is that the simplication in the pulse profile observed\nboth during the August 27 flare, and in the persistent emission following the flare, is ascribed\nto two separate physical mechanisms. The electrical current flowing along extended field lines\nis hypothesized to have changed at the beginning of the flare, giving rise to the change in the\npersistent emission pulse shape. The pulse morphology evolution during the flare itself is ascribed\nto the passive cooling of a confined fireball, with the distribution of suspended matter undergoing a\ngradual simplification in response to the changing pattern of radiative intensity emerging from the\ncontracting fireball. In addition, the persistent X-ray pulse profile observed before the flare had a\nsimilar morphology to the complicated four-peaked pulse shape observed during the intermediate\nstages of the August 27 flare (Woods et al. 2001) \u2013 and yet the mechanism for supplying the\nanisotropic scattering screen is different in the two cases. One requires a correlation between the\ncurrent distribution flowing along extended field lines in the pre-flare state, and the energy release\nwithin the flare itself.\nAn extreme alternative to this model is that the entire external magnetic field of SGR 1900+14\nwas reconfigured into a simpler geometry over the duration of the August 27 flare (Woods et al.\n2001). In this model, the magnetosphere is assumed to remain optically thin post-flare (i.e. no\nscattering screen). The similar morphology and good phase alignment of the burst and post-burst\npulsations during the 2001 April 18 flare follow naturally if there is a common dissipative region.\nHowever, the reconfiguration of the field would have to progress on a timescale \u223c107 times longer\nthan the Alfv\u00e9n crossing time of the magnetosphere (\u223c30 \u03bcsec), and \u223c 104 times longer than\nthe corresponding timescale in the deep interior of the star (e.g. Thompson & Duncan 1995).\nRecently, Lyutikov (2003) argued that reconnection in the magnetosphere driven by a tearing\nmode instability would proceed on a longer timescale of order \u223c10 ms. This timescale is consistent\nwith the rise time of the more common SGR bursts (G\u00f6\u011f\u00fc\u015f et al. 2001), but still many orders of\nmagnitude shorter than the timescale of the pulse profile change observed during the August 27\nflare (\u223c5 min).\nA global magnetospheric reconfiguration during the August 27 flare has the advantage\n13\n\nOnly one part in 1010 of the energy of the August 27 flare need be expended to lift a scattering cloud that is\noptically thick at 10 keV at the electron cyclotron resonance. Similarly, one part in a million is enough to create a\nlarge optical depth to Thomson scattering at a similar radius.\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nof providing the most straightforward explanation of the pulse morphology changes seen in\nSGR 1900+14, both in 1998 and 2001. However, there is still the challenge of explaining how the\nfield would continue to reconfigure itself over a duration of \u223c 400 seconds in a very smooth manner\n\u2013 without inducing secondary instabilities and reconnection events that would manifest themselves\nas sudden changes in the X-ray flux. A compromise between these models would involve a gradual\nsimplication of the most extended magnetic field lines (those which extend out to the electron\ncyclotron resonance for soft gamma-rays up to \u223c100 keV).\nWe have shown that the torque in the aftermath of the 2001 April 18 flare was a factor \u223c3\nlarger than the torque measured immediately following the 1998 August 27 flare. In contrast, the\nburst activity following the August 27 flare was more intense and persisted longer than the activity\nfollowing April 18. The torque measured following this intermediate flare is large as compared to\nthe post-August 27 torque, but is not the largest measured for SGR 1900+14. Comparison of the\nburst activity and spindown in April 2001 with previous epochs in SGR 1900+14 strengthens our\nearlier conclusion (Woods et al. 1999b, 2002) that there exists no direct correlation between burst\nactivity and torque in this system.\nOur comparison of the gamma-ray pulse profile with the X-ray ephemeris has shown that\nthere is no evidence for transient post-flare spindown of the magnitude and type inferred for\nthe August 27 flare. This observation also lends credence to the interpretation of the phase\nmis-alignment in the August 27 flare as being due to a sudden spindown event (Palmer 2001;\nWoods et al. 1999b) rather than a strong energy dependence in the pulse profile. Although we can\nexclude a sudden spindown like that inferred for the August 27 flare, the fortuitous observation\npreceding the April 18 flare indicates that there was some timing anomaly near the epoch of the\nflare. Unfortunately, the exact manner in which the spin frequency of the star evolved leading up\nto and through both flares is not certain due to uncertainty in the pre-flare spin ephemerides.\nThe value of precise pre-flare spin ephemerides is best illustrated in the recent SGR-like outburst\nfrom the anomalous X-ray pulsar 1E 2259+586 (Kaspi et al. 2003). In this case, the continuous\nmonitoring of 1E 2259+586 leading up to this outburst allowed Kaspi et al. (2003) to detect a\nsudden spin-up or glitch that coincided with the burst activation. Since the onset of burst activity\nin SGRs is unpredictable, continuous monitoring of their spin ephemerides is required to quantify\ntiming events such as the glitch detected in 1E 2259+586 coincident with bursts, and hence\nconstrain the underlying physical mechanism responsible for the busts.\nAcknowledgements \u2013 We thank the RXTE/SDC and the SAX/SDC for pre-processing the\nRXTE/PCA and BeppoSAX data, respectively.
