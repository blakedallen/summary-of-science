Achieving this requires\nsignificant investment for test beam activities to complete the detector R&D needed, to test\nprototypes and (later) to qualifying final system designs, including integrated system test. To\nrealize this efficiently, the ILC detector R&D groups and accelerator experts at test beam\nfacilities have been working together. After the first ILC Detector Test Beam Workshop had\nbeen held at Fermilab in 2007 (IDTB071), the roadmap document2 for ILC detector R&D was\nwritten and sent to the executives of particle physics laboratories in the world. Since then the\ndetector R&D groups, especially for the calorimetry and tracking devices, have obtained\nmany fruitful results on their prototypes and various experiences at the test beam facilities.\nAfter LoIs of the two detector concept groups, ILD and SiD, had been validated in 2009, the\ndetector R&D groups entered a new phase toward final system designs. For this purpose the\nsecond ILC Detector Test Beam Workshop was held at LAL Orsay in November 2009\n(LCTW093), and a new document is being prepared as a result of the workshop. In the test\nbeam session of LCWS2010, which was very compact, updates since LCTW09 and future\nplans were reported and discussed. In addition, status of the AIDA4 project to boost European\ndetector R&D for accelerator experiments was presented.\n\n2\n\nTest Beam Facilities\n\nWe had three talks on test beam facilities. Some highlights of them are given in this document.\nFor details, please refer to original contributions in these proceedings.\n\n2.1\n\nFermilab Test Beam Facility\n\nThe Meson Test Facility (MTest) at Fermilab has been providing high energy particle beams\nfor the R&D studies of the ILD detector. MTest gives users an opportunity to test the\nperformance of their particle detectors in a variety of particle beams. A good example is the\n*\n\nThis work is supported by the Grant-in-Aid for Science Research, JSPS (No. 19204027).\n\nLCWS/ILC 2010\n\n\fcombined test of the CALICE collaboration, where the prototypes of electromagnetic and\nhadron calorimeters, as well as a muon tail catcher were combined and tested together.\nOne of the requests of the detector R&D groups is to have test beams with an ILC-like time\nstructure (1 ms train with a 199 ms inter-train quiet period). To this purpose the Accelerator\ndivision has installed quadruple extraction hardware that can deliver beams within 1 to 5 ms\nshort spills.\nAt the experimental area of MTest, new common equipments have been installed (see Fig. 1).\nOne is the precision tracking devices: two stations of PHENIX pixel tracker (pixel size\n50x400 \u03bcm2, active area 6x6 cm2) and four stations of CMS pixel tracker (pixel size 100x150\n\u03bcm2, overlap area 2x2 cm2) . The other is a fast timing detector, made of quarts bar and\nPHOTEK MCPs, with a time resolution of 6 ps.\nIn addition to the MTest beam line, Fermilab is preparing a new test beam facility in the\nMeson Center beam line. The proposal of the new facility (MCenter Test Facility) has been\napproved and the facility is expected to be available after 2010 summer shutdown.\n\nFigure 1: A station of CMS pixel tracker (left) and the fast\ntiming detector.\n\n2.2\n\nESTB SLAC Test Beam Project\n\nEnd Station Test Beam (ESTB) is an approved and funded SLAC project to use a small\nfraction of the 13.6 GeV electron beam from the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) to\nrestore test beam capability in End Station A (ESA) as shown in Fig. 2. Four kicker magnets\nwill be installed in the Beam Switch Yard to divert 5 Hz of LCLS beam to the A-line. This\nbeam can be directed against a thin screen to produce secondary electrons or positrons with\nenergies up to the incident energy, and a wide range of intensities including single particles\nper pulse suitable for detector studies. ESTB is constructed in 2010 and will be available by\nSpring 2011. The installation of a secondary hadron target and a hadron beam line in ESA is a\npossible upgrade for 2011. This beam will produce pions and kaons over a broad range of\nLCWS/ILC 2010\n\n\fmomentum, suitable detector R&D. The expected yields of secondary particles are shown in\nFig. 3.\n\nFigure 2: A schematic view of ESTB.\n\nFigure 3: Expected yields of\nsecondary particles at ESTB.\n\n2.3\n\nAsian Test Beam Facilities\n\nThere are several low energy test beam facilities in Asia, where test of small units can be\nperformed.\n2.3.1 J-PARC Test Beam Facility\nIn Japan, the test beam line at KEK (FTBL) was shut down at the end of 2009 for the upgrade\nof the KEKB collider. On the other hand, a new test beam facility is being constructed in the\nhadron experimental hall at J-PARC (see Figure 4). The 50 GeV proton synchrotron started\nits operation at 30 GeV beam energy in 2009. The K1.1 Beam line will become available in\nfall 2010, where hadrons with momentum 0.5~1.1 GeV and good enough particle yields are\navailable. This beam line can be used for test beam experiments until preparation of the main\nexperiment at K1.1 is started. The K1.8BR beam line is dedicated to the test beam\nexperiments, and hadrons with momentum 0.5~1.5 GeV are available. This beam line also\nwill be ready in 2010. However, the particle yields are expected to be very small at the\nbeginning to be used for the experiments, until the intensity of the proton synchrotron\nbecomes close to the design value (100 MW).\n2.3.2 IHEP Beijing Test Beam Facility\nIn China, BTF (Beijing Test beam Facility) provides primarily electron beams with\nmomentum 1.1~1.5 GeV and secondary beams with momentum 0.4~1.2 GeV. BTF is now\nunder a long shut down for its upgrade. The commissioning is scheduled to start in January\n2011.\n\nLCWS/ILC 2010\n\n\fFigure 4: A schematic view of the accelerator complex at J-PARC and\nthe test beam lines in the experimental hall.\n\n3\n\nSummary\n\nThe detector R&D groups deeply acknowledge the effort of the staffs of test beam facilities at\nparticle physics laboratories for providing test beams in recent years. The R&D groups\ndefinitely need new or upgraded test beam facilities to continue their studies for the ILC\nproject. To keep the momentum of the test beam activities, communication between the\nfacility staffs and the users is essential.\n\n4\n\nReferences\n\n[1] URL : https://conference.fnal.gov/idtb07/.\n[2] Roadmap for ILC Detector R&D Test Beams, World Wide ILC Detector R&D Community, KEK Report\n2007-3, FERMILAB-TM-2392-AD-DO-E, August 2007, unpublished.\n[3] URL : http://events.lal.in2p3.fr/conferences/LCTW09/\n\"Report on LCTW09 at Orsay\", R.
