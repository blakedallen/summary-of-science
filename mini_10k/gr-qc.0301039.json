This is possible in existence of a cosmological repulsion which\nis described usually by \u039b-term or equivalently\nby the presence of an vacuum-like medium with\na negative pressure. An open universe will expand forever even if \u039b = 0. A closed universe at\n\u039b = 0 will stop expanding in future and begin to\nrecollapse without fail. If \u039b > 0, the expansion\nbecomes accelerated when the doubled vacuum\ndensity exceeds the decreasing matter density.\nThe open universe is sure to pass this condition\nand its eternal expansion has not an alternative1 .\nReaching of the closed universe the acceleration\nstate and its consequent eternal expansion requires a potential barrier overcoming which is\npossible under certain conditions. In this work a\nrestriction on the closed universe parameters being necessary to getting over the barrier and the\nuniverse dynamics in this case are investigated.\n\nCondition of eternal\nexpansion\n\nThe closed universe dynamics is described by the\nEinstein field equation for curvature radius a of\n3-space in comoving with cosmological expansion\nnonrotating (synchronous) frame:\n\u02272 =\n\na2\nAm\n+ 2 \u2212 1.\na\nAv\n\n(1)\n\nHere and below convention c = 1 is used.

The condition of the closed universe eternal expansion restricts the Friedmann integrals\nratio by the correlation (8). Written down for\nthe density parameters \u03a9m , \u03a9v this correlation\n(13) separate the area in the phase-space (Fig.\n2). The measured parameters \u03a9m , \u03a9v of our\nUniverse are found in this area. The Friedmann\nintegrals of our Universe do not coincide. The\nphase curves of the eternally expanding closed\nuniverses have been plotted. The dependence of\nthe cosmological parameters \u03a9m , \u03a9v , q, H on\nthe universe curvature radius a has been investigated.\n\nReferences\n[1] A.G. Riess et al., Astron.

Carrol, Living Rev. Rel. 4 (2001) 1,\nastro-ph/0004075.\n\nIt should be mentioned that at an early stage\nof an universe evolution a radiation density \u03c1r\ndominates, then phase-space is three-dimensional\n(\u03a9m , \u03a9v , \u03a9r ). The phase curves begin at the\npoint (0, 0, 1); they are directed to the \u03a9r axis\nfor a closed universe, and when the matter grows\npredominant over the radiation, the curves pass\non (\u03a9m , \u03a9v ) plane as it is shown in Fig. 2. The\nvacuum energy density \u03c1v is to prevail at a still\nmore early stage preceding radiation-dominated,\nand then the universe develops from de Sitter\nmetric to de Sitter metric along a closed phase\ncurve. This curve simplified has been plotted\nhere for a flat universe \u03a9m + \u03a9v + \u03a9r = 1.\n\n[4] A.A. Starobinski, Grav. Cosmol. 6 (2000)\n157, astro-ph/9912054.\n[5] A.D.
