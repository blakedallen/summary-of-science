Opt.\n\n\fResolved diffraction patterns from a reflection grating for atoms\n\n2\n\nDiffraction of atoms by periodic potentials has been a subject of study ever since\nthe beginning of the field of atom optics. The most extensive work has been done in\na transmission geometry [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11], but reflection gratings have\nbeen demonstrated as well. Using evanescent wave mirrors, reflection gratings have been\nproduced by retroreflecting the laser beam creating the evanescent wave [12, 13, 14, 15]\nor by temporally modulating the intensity of the evanescent wave [16]. Magnetic mirrors\nhave also been rendered periodic by adding an appropriate external magnetic field [17].\nMany early experiments on atomic reflection gratings were done at grazing\nincidence, but this problem proved considerably more subtle than was first imagined\n(for a review see [18]). It turned out that atomic diffraction at grazing incidence cannot\nbe analogous to the diffraction of light (or X rays) on a reflection grating, because the\nreflection is not on a hard wall, but on a soft barrier, so that the atom averages out\nthe grating modulation during the bounce. Alternatively, one can show that scalar\n(i.e. without internal state change) atomic diffraction at grazing incidence on a soft\nreflection grating would not allow energy and momentum conservation. This is why\ngrazing incidence atomic diffraction must be a process with an internal state change.\nThe change in internal energy allows the process to conserve energy. \"Straightforward\",\nscalar diffraction which is due only to a periodic modulation of the atomic wave front,\ncan only be achieved at normal incidence, as implemented in reference [13].\nThis experiment suffered however from a resolution which was not quite high enough\nto separate the individual diffraction peaks. Although it was possible to deconvolve the\nexperimental resolution, and make a quantitative comparison with a scalar diffraction\ntheory, it was disappointing not to be able to directly see the diffraction peaks. Here we\ndiscuss an improved version of this experiment in which we use velocity selective Raman\ntransitions to select and analyze a velocity class much narrower than what was possible\nin the experiments of reference [13]. We are thus able to resolve the diffraction peaks.\nOur results are also significant from the point of view of measurements of the\nroughness of atomic mirrors. These measurements have been performed for both\nmagnetic and evanescent wave mirrors [19, 20, 21, 22, 23]. Some of the interpretation\nof these measurements relies on theoretical treatments developed in close analogy with\nthe theory of atom diffraction [24], and it is clearly useful to make additional tests of\nthe theory when possible.\nOur velocity selection scheme is shown in figure 1. Two counterpropagating, phaselocked lasers induce transitions between the two hyperfine levels of 85 Rb. They are\ndetuned from resonance by about 600 MHz (\u2206 in figure 1). The detuning \u03b4 for this two\nphoton transition depends on the Doppler shift \u03b4 = kL (v \u00b1 vR ) [25], where kL is the\nmagnitude of the laser wavevector and vR the photon recoil velocity. Thus only atoms\nwith a given velocity v such that \u03b4 = 0 are resonant. The width of the velocity selection\nis proportional to 1/\u03c4 , where \u03c4 is the duration of the pulse. This width can be much\nsmaller than the photon recoil velocity. Figure 1 shows the various laser frequencies\nused for the Raman transitions and for the evanescent wave atomic mirror.\nOur experiment follows closely the procedures of reference [23]. It consists of two\n\n\fResolved diffraction patterns from a reflection grating for atoms\n\n3\n\n5P3/2\n\n\u2206\n\n2\n\n1\n\u03c9a\n5S1/2\n\n\u03c9b\n\u03c923\n\n\u03b4\n\u2206 Ti:Sa\n\nF=3\nF=2\n\nFigure 1.

First, to measure the atomic velocity\ndistribution after reflection, the following sequence is used. A sample of 85 Rb atoms\nare optically pumped into F=2 after preparation in a magneto-optical trap and optical\nmolasses, and released at time t = 0. A constant magnetic field of 750 mG is turned on,\nto define the axis of quantization and split the mF levels. A Raman \u03c0-pulse is applied\nat t = 8 ms with detuning \u03b4S (selection). This transfers atoms from |2, 0, \u03b4S /kL \u2212 vR i\ninto |3, 0, \u03b4S /kL + vR i\u2021\u00a7. At t = 47 ms, the Ti:Sa laser that forms the evanescent wave\nis turned on. Its detuning is chosen so that it reflects atoms in F=3 (blue detuning),\nwhile being attractive for the state F=2 (red detuning). This eliminates unselected\natoms left in F=2. The Ti:Sa laser is turned off at t = 67 ms. At t = 120 ms, a second\n\u03c0-pulse is applied, with detuning \u03b4A (analysis), returning atoms in |3, 0, \u03b4A /kL + vR i\nto |2, 0, \u03b4A /kL \u2212 vR i. At t = 124 ms we switch on a pushing beam for 2 ms, resonant\nfor F=3, which accelerates F=3 atoms away from the detection region. Finally, the\nmeasured signal is the fluorescence of the remaining atoms in F=2, illuminated by a\nresonant probe beam with repumper and measured with a photomultiplier tube. To\nmeasure the number of atoms at the end of the sequence, we evaluate the area of a\nGaussian fit of the fluorescence signal.\nThis first sequence is repeated fixing \u03b4S and scanning \u03b4A . In this way, we build\nup the velocity distribution of the reflected atoms. The frequencies \u03b4A are selected in a\nrandom order, and after each shot, a second shot is taken with \u03b4S = \u03b4B (background)\nsufficiently detuned so that it does not transfer any atoms. Since we detect all atoms\nin F=2, there is a small background of atoms that have not been selected, but instead\nscattered a photon, thereby finishing in the same state as the atoms that have been\nselected. This can occur during the analysis pulse, and during interaction with the\nTi:Sa laser. We estimate that around 10% of atoms undergo such processes in the\n\u2021 The basis is |F, mF , vi where v is the atom velocity along the laser beam propagation.\n\u00a7 We choose the hyperfine sublevel mF = 0 because it is insensitive (to first order) to magnetic fields.\n\n\fResolved diffraction patterns from a reflection grating for atoms\n\n4\n\nevanescent wave, and 1% during each \u03c0 pulse. Most of these atoms are accounted for by\nthe background shot. The background shot is subtracted from the signal shot, and the\ndifference is the data point. We average each data point 5 times, so that a diffraction\npattern takes around 20 minutes to acquire.\nTo complete the experiment, we need to know the velocity distribution of the atoms\nselected by the first pulse. To measure this we employ a second sequence, essentially the\nsame as the first, but without the mirror. Atoms are prepared in F = 3 at the end of the\noptical molasses. At t = 8 ms the first Raman pulse transfers resonant atoms to F = 2,\nother atoms are removed with the pushing beam. At t = 22 ms the second Raman\npulse transfers atoms back in F = 3 and we finally detect only atoms in F = 3. By\nscanning the detuning of the second Raman pulse we can measure the velocity width of\nthe atoms selected by the first pulse. The observed velocity distribution is well fitted by\na Gaussian function with a width given by 2 kL \u03c3v \u2248 2\u03c0/\u03c4 . Because of the convolution of\n\u221a\nthe selection and analysis pulses, the observed velocity distribution is approximately 2\ntimes larger than that due to the selection pulse alone. For a pulse length of \u03c4 = 120 \u03bcs,\nthe measured rms width is 2 kL \u03c3v = 2\u03c0 \u00d7 7.7 kHz or \u03c3v = 0.50 vR = 3.0 mm.s\u22121 . We\nwill use this Gaussian function as our resolution function S(\u03b4). Any differences between\nthe two measured velocity distributions are attributed to the action of the diffraction\ngrating.\nThe reflection grating for atoms is made by retroreflecting a small proportion of\nlight that makes the evanescent wave: a standing wave is created on the mirror and the\npotential seen by the atoms can be written (neglecting the van der Waals interaction\nfor the moment)\nU(x, z) = U0 e\u22122 \u03ba z (1 + \u01eb cos(2 kx x)),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u01eb is the contrast of the interference pattern, 1/\u03ba is the decay length of the electric\nfield, and kx is the propagation wave vector of the evanescent wave. The contrast \u01eb can\nbe written:\n\u221a\n2 R kx2 \u2212 \u03ba2\n,\n(2)\n\u01eb=\n1 + R kx2 + \u03ba2\nwhere R = IR /I0 is the intensity fraction of the laser beam that is retroreflected. To a\ngood approximation, the grating behaves as a thin phase grating, producing a modulated\nde Broglie wave whose predicted phase modulation index is:\n2\u03c0 \u01eb\n,\n(3)\n\u03c6=\n\u03bbdB \u03ba\nwhere \u03bbdB is the de Broglie wavelength of the atomic cloud incident on the mirror. The\nvan der Waals force introduces a multiplicative correction that here increases the phase\nmodulation index \u03c6 [13] by 12% .\nIn our experiments, \u03ba = 1.14 kL. When the contrast of the grating \u01eb is of order\n\u03bbdB /\u03bbL , we have \u03c6 \u223c 1 rad, and the diffraction is efficient. Here, \u03bbdB = 7 nm and\n\u03bbL = 780 nm. Thus we only need a very weak contrast \u01eb \u223c 10\u22122 , corresponding to\nR \u223c 10\u22124 .\n\n\fResolved diffraction patterns from a reflection grating for atoms\nTi:Sa\n\n5\n\nPa\nRaman\n\nPrism\n\nx\nVacuum\nchamber\n\ny\n\nRaman\nPb\n\u03bb/2\n\n\u03bb/4\n\nFigure 2.

The system of polarizers and wave plates allows us to\nreflect a small controlled amount of the Ti:Sa beam.\n\nThe nth diffraction order acquires a transverse momentum of 2 n ~ kx and has an\nintensity of Jn2 (\u03c6), where Jn is the Bessel function of order n. Here, kx = 1.5 kL, so to\ndistinguish two successive diffraction orders, we must have a velocity selection in the x\ndirection better than 1.5 vR .\nFigure 2 shows the experimental geometry. The mirror is 20.7 mm below the\nmagneto-optical trap. It is a prism with an index of refraction of n = 1.869 and the\nangle of incidence of the Ti:Sa laser \u03b8 = 53\u25e6 . The prism is superpolished and has a\nroughness of about 0.07 nm deduced from measurements made with an atomic force\nmicroscope and a Zygo optical heterodyne profiler. To remove the degeneracy of the\nZeeman sublevels, a magnetic bias field of 750 mG is applied along the direction of\npropagation of the Raman beams. After the first \u03c0 pulse, the direction of the magnetic\nbias field is rotated by 45\u25e6 so that it lies along the y-direction, corresponding to the\nquantization axis of the evanescent wave. The change is carried out over 10 ms, so that\nthe atoms adiabatically follow the field. The direction of the field is turned back after\nthe bounce for the second \u03c0 pulse.\nAlso shown in figure 2 is the setup for measuring and controlling the retroreflected\npower R. The two wave plates control the power, the half wave plate is used as a coarse\nand the quarter wave plate as a fine adjustment. A cat's eye arrangement is used to\ncontrol the spatial superposition and size of the return beam. The experimental setup\nfor the Raman beams has been described elsewhere [23].\nTo measure R, first the incident power is found from Pa and the (known)\ntransmission T of the first mirror in figure 2. Then the quarter wave plate is turned to\nthe position that maximizes the power Pb . Next, the position of the half wave plate is\nfixed so that Pb /(Pa /T ) is the maximum value of R desired. Finally, the quarter wave\nplate is adjusted to vary the R over the desired range.

The\ndata in the figure give a peak separation of \u03b40 = 2\u03c0 \u00d7 38 kHz. The difference between\nthe calculated and observed peak separations is rather large, but we currently have no\nsatisfactory explanation for this discrepancy.\nThe data are fitted by the following function:\nX\u0002\n\u0003\na + b R(\u03b4) \u00d7\nJn2 (\u03c6) \u03b4(\u03b4 \u2212 n \u03b40 ) \u2217 {S(\u03b4) + c M(\u03b4)}\n(5)\nn\n\nEach diffraction order has a weight given by the value of the Bessel function Jn2 (\u03c6) and\nis convolved by the resolution function S(\u03b4), plus the function M(\u03b4) that accounts for\na background of atoms whose velocity distribution is imposed by the spatial extent of\nthe mirror. The resolution function is a gaussian profile with rms width 7.7 kHz. This\nentire function is then multiplied by the function R(\u03b4) which takes account of the spatial\nvariation of the Raman beams.\nThe widths of the functions R, S and M are calculated from measured values,\nso that there are only four adjustable parameters for the fitting procedure: an offset\na, the amplitude of the curve b, the phase modulation index \u03c6, and the background\nterm c.

Fitted and predicted phase modulation index. The fitted values are deduced\nfrom the velocity profile of the diffracted atoms and the predicted ones are calculated\nfrom the measurement of the amount of reflected power R (taking into account the\nVan der Waals interaction). The straight line fit has gradient 1.11(8).\n\nare in satisfactory agreement to within our uncertainty, which is chiefly limited by the\nuncertainty in the superposition of the return beam.\nTo conclude, the fact that the peak heights can be accounted for by a series of Bessel\nfunctions depending on a single parameter, the modulation index, is quite remarkable\nand constitutes the central result of this work. It shows that one can reach a regime\nin which the atomic diffraction on a corrugated mirror can be described simply as a\nreflection of a scalar matter wave, with a phase modulation of the reflected wavefront\ncalculated within the straightforward thin phase grating approximation [26]. In this\nregime, one thus have a close analogy to light diffraction off a reflection grating.\nThis work was supported by the European Union under grants IST\u20131999\u201311055\nand HPRN\u2013CT\u20132000\u201300125, and by the DGA grant 00.34.025.\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n\nGould P L, Ruff G A, and Pritchard D E 1986 Phys.
