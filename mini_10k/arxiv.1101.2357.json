These three classes play a prominent role in graph\nconnectivity theory, and we give a brief introduction with a light\nemphasis on reduction- and construction theorems for classes of\nk-connected graphs.\n\n1. Introduction\nOne of the main concerns of graph connectivity theory is to find reduction\nmethods for classes of k-connected graphs. Such methods can be used for induction proofs, but have also a constructive counterpart which might be helpful\nfor generating the respective classes. They also can be employed for setting up\nproblem solving strategies for general graphs: Roughly, if a graph has a small\ncutset then we can split it into two smaller parts, solve the problem, and combine the solutions, and if not then we might reduce and use structural properties\n\n1\n\nJune 12, 2018\n\n\fof k-connected graphs.1\nTutte was the first who studied such methods systematically for 2- and 3connected graphs. Let us start, as an initial example, with the following version\nof his celebrated Wheel Theorem [82]:\nTheorem 1.1 Every 3-connected simple graph non-isomorphic to a wheel can\nbe reduced to a smaller 3-connected simple graph by either deleting or contracting\nan edge.2\nThis is a reduction theorem for the class of simple 3-connected graphs. It tells\nus that unless such a graph belongs to a simple subclass of basic graphs (the\nwheels), we can reduce it to a smaller one by performing a short sequence of\nelementary reductions (deleting or contracting an edge). Throughout Section\n6, we will discuss a number of similar methods for more classes of k-connected\ngraphs. Not all of them will operate in terms of deletion and contraction, but\nthere is a good reason to concentrate on these: Contracting or deleting edges,\nas well as deleting vertices, will not create minors in the reduced graph which\nhave not been there before, that is, we will stay inside any given class described\nby forbidden minors; the only reason for which the reduction might fail is that\nthe resulting graph is not k-connected.\nThe methods to actually find reducible objects (for example a single contractible\nor deletable edge, as in the Wheel Theorem) are of course encoded in the respective proofs. They often have a potential for generalization, which would\ntypically answer questions like: (a) Are there many reducible objects? (b) Are\nthey all over the place? (c) Can we reduce in such a way that some additional\nproperty survives? In very basic terms, these are questions on the number and\ndistribution of reducible objects. In (c), an additional property might be simplicity as in the Wheel Theorem; another such property might be to contain\na specific graph as a minor, and this could lead to what is commonly called a\nsplitter theorem. As an example, let us mention Negami's splitter theorem for\n3-connected graphs [65]:\nTheorem 1.2 Let H be any 3-connected graph non-isomorphic to a wheel.\nThen every 3-connected simple graph non-isomorphic to H and containing H\nas a minor can be reduced to a smaller 3-connected simple graph containing H\nas a minor by deleting or contracting a single edge.\nThe results of Section 6 can be considered as high-end outcomes of a flourishing\nstudy of the distribution of reducible objects in a graph. We start, in Section 2,\n1 An instructive example of this is Carsten Thomassen's brilliant proof for Kuratowski's\nTheorem [77].\n2 All graphs considered here are, for the time being, finite and undirected. For terminology\nnot defined here, I refer to [2] and [7]. To contract an edge means to delete it and to identify\nits endpoints; in general, that may cause multiple edges. A wheel is obtained from a cycle of\nlength at least 3 by adding a new vertex and connecting it to all others by a single edge.\n\n2\n\nJune 12, 2018\n\n\fwith a brief treatise of minimally k-connected graphs, i. e. k-connected graphs\nwhere deleting any edge produces a graph which is no longer k-connected. These\nclasses are far too big to become reasonably primitive base classes for a reduction\ntheorem, even in the case that k = 2. The same applies to critically k-connected\ngraphs studied in Section 3, i. e. k-connected graphs where deleting any vertex\nproduces a graph which is no longer k-connected, and even to the intersection\nclass of both minimally and critically k-connected graphs3 . Therefore, it is\nnecessary to look at yet another elementary operation - and see how far that\nwould lead. According to our above remarks, edge contraction is a good choice.\nThe corresponding class of contraction-critically k-connected graphs, i. e. kconnected graphs where contracting any edge produces a graph which is no\nlonger k-connected, is considered in Section 4. It is a proper subclass of the\ncritically k-connected graphs (however, both criticity concepts can be treated\nas special cases of a more general one recalled in Section 5). For k \u2264 3, it\nconsists just consists of Kk+1 , which is certainly a sufficiently basic graph. For\nk \u2265 4, there are infinitely many contraction-critically k-connected graphs, and\nthey are rich in a sense. Still, for k = 4, we may either describe most of them\nas line graphs of a class of cubic graphs which in turn admits a constructive\ncharacterization. Alternatively, these contraction critically 4-connected graphs\ncan be reduced by contacting two edges to obtain a smaller 4-connected graph\n[39]. This suggests an idea of what could be true for 5-connected graphs [39]:\nConjecture 1.3 There exist integers b, h such that every 5-connected graph on\nat least b vertices can be reduced to a smaller one by contracting at most h edges.\nAs we have pointed out, the corresponding result for 4-, 3-, 2-, and 1-connected\ngraphs is true. The reason for Conjecture 1.3 being an interesting question is,\nhowever, not, that it would settle the next open case, but that it would settle the\nlast open case: The corresponding statements for 6-, 7-, * * * connected graphs are\nnot true, i.e. for k \u2265 6, there are minimally k-connected graphs showing that we\nhave to contract arbitrarily many edges to obtain a smaller k-connected graph\n(equivalently, the gap between the order of such a graph and the maximum order\nof its lower neighbors in the minor relation, restricted to k-connected graphs, is\narbitrarily large) [39].\nThis indicates that it is maybe worthwhile to look at larger substructures of the\ngraph than just vertices or edges and to study possible ways to employ them\nfor reduction. This is the topic of Sections 7 and 8.\nMany problems involving vertex-connectivity have a literal counterpart in terms\nof edge-connectivity. Although in most cases these turn out to be easy if not\ntrivial, the restriction of the original vertex-connectivity problems to line graphs\nis a little bit more demanding and may serve as a touchstone, as it is finally\nillustrated in Section 9.\n3 For example, every k-connected graph where every every edge is incident with a vertex of\ndegree k and every vertex is adjacent to a vertex of degree k - in particular, k-regular graphs\n- are among these.\n\n3\n\nJune 12, 2018\n\n\f2. Edge Deletion\nWe start with a brief section on graphs where deleting any edge decreases its\nconnectivity. Let G be a k-connected graph4 . An edge e of G is called k-essential\nif G \u2212 e is not k-connected, and G is called minimally k-connected if every edge\nis k-essential. The connectivity of such a graph is equal to k. Minimally k-edgeconnected graphs are very well understood which is mostly due to the following\nfundamental statement relating vertices of degree k and k-essential edges [50,\nSatz 1].\nTheorem 2.1 Let G be a k-connected graph and C be a cycle of k-essential\nedges in G. Then there exists a vertex in V (C) of degree k in G.\nAs an immediate consequence, in a minimally k-connected graph G the vertices\nof degree larger than k induce a forest [50], and it is easy to derive that such a\nk\u22121\ngraph must have more than 2k\u22121\n|V (G)| many vertices of degree k [50]. Moreover, Theorem 2.1 implies that every minimally k-connected graph G is the edge\ndisjoint union of a tree and k \u2212 1 forests5 . In particular, the average degree of\na minimally k-connected graph is less than 2k.\nAnother consequence of Theorem 2.1 is that every minimally k-connected graph\nhas at least k +1 vertices of degree k [50]. This implies that - unlike in the case\nof vertex deletion (see the next section) - deleting an edge e from a k-connected\ngraph G, where k \u2265 2, will almost never produce a minimally (k \u2212 1)-connected\ngraph: The only exception is that G is a cycle.6\nHalin proved earlier that every triangle of k-essential edges in a k-connected\ngraph contains at least two vertices of degree k (see [21, Satz 3']).\nFor a comprehensive survey on minimally k-connected graphs and digraphs see\n[57].\n4 That is, G has more than k vertices and cannot be separated by removing less than k\nvertices, i.e. G \u2212 X is connected for all X \u2286 V (G) with |X| < k. The smallest k for which G\nis k-connected is the connectivity of G, denoted by \u03ba(G).\n5 The proof by induction on k starts obviously for k = 1, whereas for k > 1 G contains a\nminimally (k \u2212 1)-connected subgraph H, for which the statement is true; if there was a cycle\nconsisting of edges in E(G) \u2212 E(H) then, by Theorem 2.1, it contains a vertex x of degree k\nin G - but then x had degree k \u2212 2 in H, a contradiction.\n6 If G \u2212 e is minimally (k \u2212 1)-connected then it has k vertices of degree k \u2212 1. But on the\nother hand it has at most two vertices of degree k \u2212 1, namely the endvertices of e. Hence\nk = 2 and G \u2212 e is minimally 1-connected with two vertices of degree 1, so that G must be a\ncycle.\n\n4\n\nJune 12, 2018\n\n\f3. Vertex Deletion\nLet G be a k-connected graph. A vertex x of G is called k-essential if G \u2212 x\nis not k-connected, and G is called critically k-connected if every vertex is kessential. Again, in this case, k must be equal to \u03ba(G). Any k-connected graph\nwhere every vertex is adjacent to a vertex of degree k is critically k-connected.\nClearly, such graphs might have vertices of arbitrarily large degree unless k = 1.\nOne might ask if, as for minimally k-connected graphs, a critically k-connected\ngraph must have vertices of degree k. This turns out to be true for k = 2 and\nk = 3, by the following Theorem - but it is wrong in general. To see this,\nobserve that if G is a critically k-connected graph then (a) the lexicographic\nproduct7 G[Kl ] of G and a complete graph of order l is critically kl-connected\nwith \u03b4(G[Kl ]) = \u03b4(G) * l + l \u2212 1, and (b) the graph G \u2217 K1 obtained from G by\nadding a new vertex and making it adjacent to all others is critically (k + 1)connected with \u03b4(G \u2217 K1 ) = \u03b4(G) + 1. Hence given k \u2265 2 and any critically\n2-connected graph G, the graphs G[Kk/2 ] for even k and G[K(k\u22121)/2 ] \u2217 K1 for\nodd k are critically k-connected of minimum degree \u230a 32 k \u2212 1\u230b. At the same time,\nthey are sharpness examples of the following theorem from [48].\nTheorem 3.1 For every critically k-connected graph G,\n\u03b4(G) \u2264\n\n3\n2\n\n* k \u2212 1.\n\nThis is a consequence of a more general result. To describe it, we need to\nintroduce some terminology. For any graph G, let us denote by T (G) the set\nof all separating vertex sets of cardinality \u03ba(G). A fragment of G is the union\nof the vertex sets of at least one but not all components of G \u2212 T , for some\nT \u2208 T (G). For a non-complete graph, fragments of minimum cardinality are\ncalled atoms, and this cardinality is denoted by a(G). It is easy to see that a\nvertex of a non-complete graph G of connectivity k is k-essential if and only if it\nis contained inSsome member of T (G); consequently, G is critically k-connected\nif and only if T (G) = V (G). If A is an atom then the neighbors of any x \u2208 A\nare in (A \u2212 {x}) \u222a NG (A) and |NG (A)| = \u03ba(G) because NG (A) \u2208 T (G), and so\n\u03b4(G) \u2264 \u03ba(G) + a(G) \u2212 1.\nHence Theorem 3.1 is an immediate consequence of the following from the following Theorem in [49]:\nTheorem 3.2 For every non-complete critically k-connected graph G,\na(G) \u2264 k/2.\n7 The lexicographic product G[H] of two simple loopless graphs G, H is the graph defined by\nV (G[H]) := V (G) \u00d7 V (H) and E(G[H]) := {(x, a)(y, b) : xy \u2208 E(G) \u2228 (x = y \u2227 ab \u2208 E(H))}.\nRoughly, the vertices of G are replaced by disjoint copies of H, and two such copies are\nconnected by all possible edges if their corresponding vertices in G are adjacent.\n\n5\n\nJune 12, 2018\n\n\fThis is an almost immediate consequence of the following fundamental lemma\ndue to Mader [49].\nLemma 3.3 If A is an atom of a graph G and T \u2208 T (G) contains at least one\nvertex from A then (i) A \u2286 T and (ii) |A| \u2264 |T \u2212N2G (A)| .8\nLater, we will come to a yet more general version of this (Lemma 5.1).\nUnlike for minimally k-connected graphs, the average degree of critically kconnected graphs cannot be bounded by a function of k [40].\nLemma 1 implies that distinct atoms of a k-connected graph are disjoint. This\nwas first proved by Watkins, and he used it to relate degree and connectivity of\nvertex transitive graphs (see [84], where there is also an independent proof of\nTheorem 3.1, for vertex transitive graphs). The question of relating degree and\nconnectivity of a vertex transitive graph goes back to Vizing (see page 130 of [83],\nand be aware that vertex transitive graphs are called regular there). For even\nk, the lexicographic products Cl [Kk/2 ] show that the bound of Theorem 3.1 is\nsharp for vertex transitive graphs, but for odd k our examples G[K(k\u22121)/2 ] \u2217 K1\nare not vertex transitive. Indeed, in this case we can improve the bound as\nfollows. First, (i) of Lemma 3.3 implies that distinct atoms of a critically kconnected graph are disjoint. Moreover, if G is vertex transitive then the atoms\nform a system of imprimitivity and, again by (i) of Lemma 3.3, every T \u2208 T (G)\nis the disjoint union of atoms. Therefore, a(G) divides |T | = \u03ba(G), and a(G) 6=\n|T | by (ii) of Lemma 3.3. Hence a(G) \u2264 k/p, where p is the smallest prime\ndivisor of k, which improves the bound from Theorem 3.1 to\n\u03b4(G) \u2264\n\np+1\np\n\n* k \u2212 1.\n\nThis is sharp because of the vertex transitive graphs G[Kk/p ], where G is any\nvertex transitive p-regular graph of connectivity p. See also Section 4 in [84].\nLater, Jung [28] used similar methods to analyze graphs where every vertex is\ncontained in the same number of k-atoms, i. e. fragments F with |F | \u2265 k and\n|V (G) \u2212 (F \u222a NG (F ))| \u2265 k of minimum cardinality. In particular, this lead\nto an interesting structural classification of vertex transitive graphs in terms of\nfragment clusters [28].\nIt has been observed by Watkins [84] that the disjointness of distinct atoms\nimplies a(G) = 1 (and hence \u03b4(G) = \u03ba(G)) for an edge-transitive graph G. Here\nis his argument: Assume, to the contrary, that a(G) > 1, and let A be an\natom. Then there exists a path xyz with x \u2208 NG (A) and y, z \u2208 A, and an\nautomorphism of G which maps yz to xy. Clearly, xy is contained in an atom\ndistinct but not disjoint from A, contradiction.\n8 This is a good justification for the term atom, from greek \u03ac\u03c4 o\u03bco\u03c2, meaning uncuttable/indivisible, which is resembled in in (i) - plus the connotation of being small, resembled\nin (ii).\n\n6\n\nJune 12, 2018\n\n\fMaurer and Slater [63] suggested to generalise the concept of critically k-connected graphs. They defined a graph G to be l-critically k-connected if \u03ba(G \u2212 X) =\nk\u2212l for all X \u2286 V (G) with |X| \u2264 l; equivalently, \u03ba(G) = k and either G \u223c\n= Kk+1\nor every X \u2286 V (G) with |X| \u2264 l is a subset of some T \u2208 T (G). Any such G\nis called l-critical. Obviously, G is critically k-connected if and only if G is\n1-critically k-connected, and every l-critically k-connected graph is l\u2032 -critically\nk-connected whenever 1 \u2264 l\u2032 \u2264 l. Trivially, l \u2264 k, but Maurer and Slater\nconjectured that even l \u2264 k/2 holds unless G is isomorphic to Kk+1 . This has\nfirst been proved by Su (see [74] from 1988, and, easier to access, [75] from\n1993):\nTheorem 3.4 Suppose there exists an l-critically k-connected graph non-isomorphic to Kk+1 . Then l \u2264 k/2.\nThe graphs\nSl := Kl+1 [K2 ]\nand Sl \u2212 x are l-critically 2l-connected and (l \u2212 1)-critically (2l \u2212 1)-connected,\nrespectively, thus showing that the bound in Theorem 3.4 is sharp.\nLater, in 1998, Jord\u00e1n found a very elegant argument of Theorem 3.4, which\nis one of the pearls of this part of the theory [26]. It depends on Theorem\n2.1. So let G be an l-critically k-connected graph, and let A be an atom of\nG. By Lemma 3.3 it follows easily that G \u2212 A is (l \u2212 1)-critically (k \u2212 |A|)connected, and that every fragment F of G \u2212 A is a fragment of G, where\nNG (F ) = NG\u2212A (F ) \u222a A. Each fragment of G \u2212 A contains a vertex of S :=\nNG (A). Therefore, we may add some set N of new edges between vertices of\nS such that (G \u2212 A) + N is (k \u2212 |A| + 1)-connected. If we take N inclusion\nminimal with respect to this property then every new edge will be (k \u2212 |A| + 1)essential for (G \u2212 A) + N , so that N forms a forest on S by Theorem 2.1. The\nedges of a forest (of any bipartite graph) can be covered by at most half of its\nvertices, so that there exists a set X of at most |S|/2 vertices in S meeting\neverybody from N . As for every smallest separating set of G \u2212 A, there must\nbe an edge from N connecting two distinct components of G \u2212 A (for otherwise\n\u03ba((G \u2212 A) + N ) = k \u2212 |A|), we deduce that X is not contained in a smallest\nseparating set of G \u2212 A. Consequently, |X| \u2265 l, as G \u2212 A is (l \u2212 1)-critically\n(k \u2212 |A|)-connected. Therefore, l \u2264 |X| \u2264 |S|/2 = \u03ba(G)/2, as desired.\nMader conjectured several properties of l-critically k-connected graphs stronger\nthan the statement of Theorem 3.4 in a survey paper from 1984 [55], which are,\nmeanwhile, all proved. The possibly most difficult result along these lines is the\nfollowing theorem from [23]:\nTheorem 3.5 If G \u223c\n6 Kk+1 is l-critically k-connected then G contains 2l + 2\n=\ndisjoint fragments.\n\n7\n\nJune 12, 2018\n\n\fThis has been proved by Su, too [23], and his proof is very ingenious and difficult.\nUnlike in the case of Theorem 3.4, no simpler proof has been found so far.\n(Refining his method outlined above, Jord\u00e1n gave a - still simple - proof\nthat there is an antichain9 of 2l + 2 fragments [26].) - Given an atom A of\nan l-critically k-connected graph G, we may apply Theorem 3.5 to the (l \u2212 1)critically (k \u2212 |A|)-connected graph G \u2212 A (see above). It is easy to see that\nevery fragment of G \u2212 A contains at least |A| vertices from S := NG (A), so\nthat (2(l \u2212 1) + 2) * |A| \u2264 |S| = k, which yields the following generalization of\nTheorem 3.2 (also conjectured by Mader [55]); see [23]:\nTheorem 3.6 If G \u223c\n6 Kk+1 is l-critically k-connected then a(G) \u2264\n=\n\nk\n2l .\n\nThe graphs Sl [Km ] are l-critically 2lm \u2212 connected, and they have exactly\n2l + 2 fragments, which are pairwise disjoint and have cardinality m - hence\nthe bounds in Theorem 3.6 (and Theorem 3.5) are sharp.\nSkew to these Theorems, there is the following statement on the extremely critically connected graphs, that is, the l-critically 2l-connected graphs (another\nformer conjecture by Mader [55]). See [35], [41], and [76]:\nTheorem 3.7 If G \u223c\n6= K2l+1 is l-critically 2l-connected and l \u2265 3 then G \u223c\n=\nKl+1 [K2 ] = Sl .\nA substantial part of the proof is considered with the small cases l \u2208 {3, 4} [35],\nand, in [41], to the cases up to approximately l = 20. For larger values, the\nstatement turned out to be less and less difficult in a sense [41]. The proof in\n[41] has been developed while the statement of Theorem 3.5 was still an open\nquestion, and is, thus, independent from Theorem 3.5. However, it is possible\nto simplify part of the work for the small cases by using Theorem 3.5, as it\nhas been demonstrated in [76]. A characterization of the extremely critically\nconnected graphs for odd connectivity \u2265 5, that is, the l-critically (2l + 1)connected graphs, might be achieved in the future.\nThere are several open questions on l-critically k-connected graphs, also for\nsmall values of l. For the first one, see [55]:\nConjecture 3.8 Is there an l such that every l-critically k-connected graph\ncontains a K4 ?\nThe octahedron S2 = K3 [K2 ] = K2,2,2 is 2-critically 4-connected and does not\ncontain K4 , thus showing l \u2265 3 if l as in Conjecture 3.8 existed.\nIf a, b are vertices of a 3-critically k-connected graph and A is an atom of the 1critically (k \u22122)-connected graph G\u2212{x, y}, then there exist neighbors c, d \u2208 A;\n9 With\n\nrespect to \u2286.\n\n8\n\nJune 12, 2018\n\n\fby Theorem 3.2, |A| \u2264 (k\u22122)/2, which implies that c, d have a common neighbor\nin A \u222a NG (A). This shows that a, b are at distance at most 4, and as they have\nbeen chosen arbitrarily, G has diameter at most 4 [53]. Mader asked if there\nexists any 3-critically k-connected graph of diameter 4 or 3 [55]. In [42], I\nconstructed for every l \u2265 3 an l-critically k-connected graphs of diameter 3\n(the smallest one is 122-connected and has 252 vertices). I doubt that there are\nany of diameter 4 (cf. [42]):\nConjecture 3.9 Every 3-critically k-connected graph has diameter at most 3.\nIn order to extend the construction from [42] to produce l-critically k-connected\ngraphs of diameter 4, it would be necessary to find sufficiently large l-critically\nk \u2032 -connected graphs. This turned out to be impossible for l \u2265 5 [42], and it\nwould be impossible also for l \u2208 {3, 4} if the answer to the following question\n[58, Conjecture 4.3] (see also [53]) was affirmative:\nConjecture 3.10 There exists a c > 0 such that every 3-critically k-connected\ngraph has at most ck 3/2 many vertices.\nIn [58, Corollary 1.3] it has been shown that every 3-critically k-connected graph\nhas at most 2k 2 \u2212 k many vertices, improving the constant in the bound 6k 2\nfrom [53, Satz 2]. It is not known whether there exists a c > 0 and a \u03bb < 2\nsuch that every 3-critically k-connected graph has at most ck \u03bb vertices. It is\nnot even known if this holds for l-critically k-connected graphs for a sufficiently\nlarge l (not depending on k).\nRegarding our quest for reduction theorems for a class C of k-connected graphs,\nit is possibly difficult to exploit knowledge on l-critically k-connected graphs for\nl \u2265 3. However, a k-connected graph G has two vertices x 6= y such that their\nidentification produces a smaller k-connected graph G\u2032 unless G is 2-critically\nk-connected. These vertices may be adjacent or not; if they are connected by\nan edge e then G\u2032 = G/e, and this will be discussed in Section 4. If they are\nnot then we would possibly leave class C (if it is described by forbidden minors).\nHowever, identifying non-adjacent vertices can be used to reduce k-connected\nbipartite graphs (and contraction is useless there!), as it will be explained in\nSection 6.\n\n4. Edge Contraction\nLet again G be a k-connected graph. An edge e of G is called k-contractible if\nG/e is k-connected, and G is called contraction-critically k-connected if there are\nno k-contractible edges. Again, in this case, k must be equal to \u03ba(G). There is a\nplethora of results on the existence, number, and distribution of k-contractible\n9\n\nJune 12, 2018\n\n\fedges, and the reader is refered to my survey from 2002 [39]. Here, I will repeat\nthe basics and concentrate on more recent developments.\nTrivially, every edge of a 1-connected graph non-isomorphic to K2 is 1-contractible, and it is easy to see that every vertex in a 2-connected graph G \u223c\n6 K3\n=\nis incident with some 2-contractible edge. Tutte's Theorem 1.1 from Section 1\nimplies that every 3-connected graph G \u223c\n6 K4 has a 3-contractible edge (but the\n=\nwheels of order at least 5 and many other examples show that there might be\nvertices not incident with any 3-contractible edge). From these statements we\ndeduce:\nTheorem 4.1 For k \u2264 3, Kk+1 is the only contraction-critically k-connected\ngraph.\nIn other words, for k \u2264 3, every k-connected graph non-isomorphic to Kk+1 can\nbe reduced to a smaller k-connected graph by contracting one single edge, and\nKk+1 is the only minor-minimal k-connected graph. This has been generalised\nby Egawa [11, Theorem B] as follows.\nTheorem 4.2 If G \u223c\n6= Kk+1 is contraction-critically k-connected then a(G) \u2264\nk/4.\nAs every 2-critically k-connected graph is contraction-critically k-connected,\nTheorem 4.2 also generalises Theorem 3.6, restricted to the case that l = 2.\nIn the spirit of Maurer's and Slater's generalization of criticity (see Section 3),\nMader called a graph G l-con-critically k-connected if \u03ba(G \u2212 X) = k \u2212 l for\nall X \u2286 V (G) with |X| \u2264 l and G[X] connected [58]; equivalently, \u03ba(G) = k\nand either G \u223c\n= Kk+1 or every X \u2286 V (G) with |X| \u2264 l and G[X] connected\nis a subset of some T \u2208 T (G). Clearly, every l-critically k-connected graph is\nl-con-critically k-connected, but the converse is not true (which is, by the way,\nnot easy to certify, see [58, Section 5]). Opposed to the situation of 3-critically\nk-connected graphs (see Section 3), it is not possible to bound the number of\nvertices in a 3-con-critically k-connected graph by a function of k [59]. However,\nTheorem 3.4 generalises as follows [59]:\nTheorem 4.3 Suppose there exists an l-con-critically k-connected graph nonisomorphic to Kk+1 . Then l \u2264 k/2.\nThere are infinitely many contraction critically 4-connected graphs. Fortunately,\nthey are all known, due to the following result by Fontet [15, 16] and Martinov\n[60, 61, 62] (cf. [55]):\nTheorem 4.4 The contraction-critically 4-connected graphs are the squares of\ncycles of length at least 5 and the line graphs of cubic cyclically 4-edge-connected\ngraphs.\n10\n\nJune 12, 2018\n\n\fFrom this it is easy to see that every 4-connected graph non-isomorphic to K5\nand K2,2,2 can be reduced to a smaller 4-connected graph by contracting one\nor two edges (so that K5 and K2,2,2 are the only minor minimal 4-connected\ngraphs). As it has been mentioned in the introduction, it is a burning question\nif a similar result was true for 5-connected graphs (see Conjecture 1.3).\nAnother, less straightforward way to turn Theorem 4.4 into a reduction theorem\nis to reduce cubic cyclically 4-edge-connected graphs, as follows: To suppress a\nvertex x of degree at most 2 in a graph G means to delete it and add an edge\nfrom a to b if a, b were distinct non-adjacent neighbors of x. To homotopically\ndelete an edge e in a graph means to delete it and to suppress its endvertices\nshould they have degree at most 2. The result is denoted by G \u2212 \u2212e. Observe\nthat if G is cubic and triangle-free then G \u2212 \u2212e is cubic. Now every simple,\ncyclically 4-edge-connected cubic graph non-isomorphic to K4 or the skeleton\nof a 3-dimensional cube can be reduced to a smaller cyclically 4-edge-connected\ncubic graph by homotopically delete an edge (see [55]). In the line graph this\nmeans to delete a vertex (of degree 4) and contract the two (disjoint) edges in\nits former neighborhood10 . So if G is contraction-critically 4-connected then we\nmay either reduce it this way, or G is the square of a cycle of length l \u2265 5. If\nl = 5 then G \u223c\n= K5 , if l = 6 then G \u223c\n= K2,2,2 , and if l \u2265 7 then we may contract\ntwo edges to obtain the square of a cycle of length l \u2212 2.\nLike for minimally k-connected graphs, and unlike for critically k-connected\ngraphs, the average degree of a contraction-critically k-connected graph can be\nbounded from above by a function f of k [40]. In fact, f (k) \u2264 ck 2 log k for\nsome constant c [40]. As there are contraction-critically k-connected graphs of\naverage degree k 2 /6 [37], the bound is sharp up to the logarithmic factor - of\nwhich I believe that it can be omitted [40, Conjecture 2]:\nConjecture 4.5 There exists a constant c such that every finite k-connected\ngraph of average degree at least ck 2 admits a k-contractible edge.\nIn [40], I constructed contraction-critically 5-connected graphs of average degree\n10, and conjectured that this would be sharp. However, Ando gave an example of a contraction-critical 5-connected graph of average degree 12.5 [personal\ncommunication].\nA k-contractible edge can also be forced by degree sum conditions: It has been\nproved in [37] for k \u2265 4 and k 6= 7 and in [22] for k = 7, that if the sum of\nthe degrees of any pair of vertices at distance 1 or 2 in a k-connected graph\nnon-isomorphic to Kk+1 is at least 2\u230a 45 k\u230b \u2212 1 then there exists a k-contractible\nedge. In fact, even the following weaker degree sum condition turned out to be\nsufficient (as I conjectured for all k in [37]), see [24]:\nTheorem 4.6 Let k \u2265 8. If the sum of the degrees of any two adjacent vertices\n\n10 The drawback of this, compared to just contracting any triangle in the line graph, is, that,\nin general, we cannot do it everywhere.\n\n11\n\nJune 12, 2018\n\n\fin a k-connected graph is at least 2\u230a 45 k\u230b \u2212 1 then there exists a k-contractible\nedge.\nThe degree sum bound is sharp for every k [37].\n\n5. Generalised Criticity\nMost of the considerations on fragments presented in Section 3 can be generalised to fragments whose neighborhood contains a member of a specified set\nS of vertex sets of the graph in question. This approach has been worked out\nby Mader in [56]. Given a graph G and S \u2286 P(V (G)), we call a fragment of\nG an S-fragment if S \u2286 NG (F ) for some S \u2208 S. An S-atom is a minimum\nS-fragment, and its cardinality is denoted by aS (G). Lemma 3.3 generalises as\nfollows [56]:\nLemma 5.1 Let G be a graph and S \u2286 P(V (G)). If A is an S-atom and there\nexist S \u2208 S and T \u2208 T (G) such that S \u2286 T \u2229 (A \u222a NG (A)) and A \u2229 T 6= \u2205 then\nA \u2286 T and |A| \u2264 |T \u2212 NG (A)|/2.\nIn all the results on critical graphs above, the set of critical objects - let that be\nvertices, vertex sets, or edges - was dense in the rough sense that everywhere in\nthe graph we could find them. However, in most basic situations we need only\na slightly weaker density condition, which just ensures that the preconditions of\nLemma 5.1 are satisfied: So let us call a graph G of connectivity k S-critically\nk-connected, where S \u2286 P(V (G)), if S 6= \u2205, every S \u2208 S is a subset of some\nT \u2208 T (G), and for every S-fragment A there exist S \u2208 S and T \u2208 T (G) such\nthat S \u2286 T \u2229 (A \u222a NG (A)) and A \u2229 T 6= \u2205. Using this notion, Lemma 5.1 implies\nthe following theorem from [56], by literally the same argument that led from\nLemma 3.3 to Theorem 3.2:\nTheorem 5.2 For every S-critically k-connected graph G,\naS (G) \u2264 k/2.\nMader designed this concept as a common generalization of many of the previously mentioned criticity concepts, and of others. Suppose that G is a noncomplete graph. Then:\n1. G is critically k-connected iff G is {{x} : x \u2208 V (G)}-critically k-connected.\n2. G is l-critically k-connected iff G is {X : X \u2286 V (G), |X| \u2264 l}-critically\nk-connected.\n12\n\nJune 12, 2018\n\n\f3. G is l-con-critically k-connected iff G is {X : X \u2286 V (G), |X| \u2264 l, G[X]\nis connected}-critically k-connected.\n4. G is contraction-critically k-connected iff G is {V (e) : e \u2208 E(G)}-critically\nk-connected.\n5. G is almost critically k-connected iff G is {\u2205}-critically k-connected.\n6. G is clique-critically k-connected iff G is {X : X \u2286 V (G), G[X] complete}critically k-connected.\nLet us briefly consider the last two items of the list. Accordingly, a k-connected\ngraph G \u223c\n6 Kk+1 is almost\n=\nS critically k-connected if and only if every fragment\ncontains a vertex from T (G). These graphs are important when studying the\ndistribution of contractible edges. So suppose that a vertex x of some graph\nG\u223c\n6 Kk+1 of connectivity k is not incident with a k-contractible edge. Then\n=\nit is easy to see that G is Sx -critical, where Sx := {V (e) : e \u2208 EG (x)}. Every\nfragment F of G \u2212 x is a fragment of G, where NG (F ) = NG\u2212x (F ) \u222a {x} and\nboth F and NG (F ) contain a vertex from NG (x). (In particular, G \u2212 x is almost\ncritically (k \u2212 1)-connected.) Following Mader's argument from [56], let us use\nthis fact to prove that there is a triangle in G 'close' to x, by considering an\nSx -atom A: If A consists of a single vertex y then x is on a triangle, formed\nby x, y, and any neighbor of x in NG (A). Otherwise, A must contain a pair\nof adjacent vertices, and they must have a common neighbor in A \u222a NG (A)\nbecause |A| \u2264 k/2 by Theorem 5.2 (in fact, |A| \u2264 (k \u2212 1)/2 by the appropriate\napplication of Lemma 5.1). For a detailed treatise of this interconnection, see\n[56]. Let us just mention that we get one of the main results in [78], as a\ncorollary [56]:\nTheorem 5.3 Every non-complete triangle free k-connected graph contains a\nk-contractible edge.\nA graph is clique-critical k-connected if and only if it is non-complete and \u03ba(G\u2212\nV (K)) = \u03ba(G) \u2212 |V (K)| for every clique K in G (roughly, deleting a clique will\nalways exhaust its potential of decreasing \u03ba, that is, decrease it by its order).\nA tantalizing question is, whether there are clique-critical graphs at all. Mader\nconjectured [56]:\nConjecture 5.4 There is no clique-critical k-connected graph.\nIf this was true, then, for example, every l-critically k-connected graph must\ncontain a clique on l + 1 vertices, which provides an affirmative answer to Conjecture 5.4. As a clique-critically k-connected graph is contraction-critically\nk-connected, it would contain a triangle by Theorem 5.3 - but it is not known\nwhether it would contain a K4 , cf. Conjecture 3.8. Mader proved that Conjecture 5.4 is true for k \u2264 6 [56].\n13\n\nJune 12, 2018\n\n\f6. Reduction Methods\nLet us summarise some reduction methods for k-connected graphs. The first set\nruns in terms of k-contractible edges; for a comprehensive survey, see [39]. Trivially, every edge of a 1-connected graph non-isomorphic to K2 is 1-contractible.\nThe respective statement for 2-connected graphs is not true, as it might happen\nthat the endvertices of some edge separate. However, we have11 :\nTheorem 6.1 Every vertex of a 2-connected graph non-isomorphic to K3 is\nincident with a 2-contractible edge.\nFor 3-connected graphs, we have the following, as an immediate consequence\neither of the Wheel Theorem (Theorem 1.1), or of Theorem 4.2:\nTheorem 6.2 Every 3-connected graph non-isomorphic to K4 has a 3-contractible edge.\nFor 4-connected graphs, the following theorem [39, Theorem 45] can be deduced\nfrom Theorem 4.4 (sketch of proof see there).\nTheorem 6.3 Every 4-connected graph non-isomorphic to K5 or K2,2,2 can be\nreduced to a smaller 4-connected graph by contracting one or two edges.\nAs it has been mentioned in the introduction, the option of contracting a constantly bounded number of edges in one step might yield a similar reduction\ntheorem for 5-connected graphs, but not for k-connected graphs where k > 5.\nTheorems 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3 also provide the minor-minimal k-connected graphs\nfor k \u2264 4. It follows from [67, (1.4)] that the class of minor-minimal 5-connected\ngraphs is finite (as there exist planar 5-connected graphs), but there is an 'exact'\nconjecture by Fijav\u017e [13]:\nConjecture 6.4 Every 5-connected graph contains a minor isomorphic to one\n \u0303 or G0 .12\nof the graphs K6 , K2,2,2,1 , C5 \u2217 K3 , I, I,\n11 As\n\nan immediate consequence of Lemma 5.1 applied to Sx as in the preceeding paragraph.\nK6 is the complete graph on six vertices, the Tur\u00e1n\u2013graph K2,2,2,1 is obtained from\na complete graph on seven vertices by deleting three independent edges, C5 \u2217 K3 is obtained\nfrom a cycle C5 by adding 3 new vertices and making them adjacent to all vertices of the C5 ,\nI denotes the icosahedron, I \u0303 is the graph obtained from I by replacing the edges of a cycle\nabcdea induced by the neighborhood of some vertex with the edges of a cycle abceda, and G0\nis the graph obtained from the icosahedron by deleting a vertex w, replacing the edge ab of\na cycle abcdea induced by the neighborhood of w with the two edges ac and ad, and, finally,\nidentifying b and e.\n12 Here\n\n14\n\nJune 12, 2018\n\n\fk\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\nMinor base\n{K2 }\n{K3 }\n{K4 }\n{K5 , K2,2,2 }\n \u0303 G0 }\n{K6 , K2,2,2,1 , C5 \u2217 K3 , I, I,\n\nReference\nobvious\nobvious\nwell-known13 , Theorem 6.2, Tutte [82]\nTheorem 6.3\nconjectured by Fijav\u017e [13, 14]\n\nTable 1: Numbers k for which the minor-minimal k-connected graphs are known\nor predicted.\nFijav\u017e proved this for graphs embeddable on the projective plane (K2,2,2,1 , C5 \u2217\nK3 are not projective planar) [13, 14]. See also Table 1. Apparently, to prove\nthat, for any k > 5, there are only finitely many minor-minimal k-connected\ngraphs, we need the full statement of Wagner's Conjecture (proved in [68]).\nA different reduction method has been developed by Dawes in [5]. His starting\npoint was Dirac's Theorem that the class of minimally 2-connected graphs is the\nclass of graphs obtained from the cycles by finite sequences of attaching paths\nof length at least 2 to suitable pairs of vertices14 . The corresponding reduction\ntheorem thus states that every minimally 2-connected graph distinct from a\ncycle can be reduced to a smaller such graph by deleting the interior vertices of\nsome path of length at least 2 whose interior vertices have degree 2 (not every\nsuch path will do the trick).15 In [5], Dawes suggested the following operations\nfor each k \u2265 1 to construct a larger graph from a given one: Operation Ak is\nto choose s \u2265 1 distinct edges and k \u2212 2s \u2265 0 distinct vertices, delete each of\nthe chosen edges, add a new vertex x, and add a new edge from x to each end\nvertex of each chosen edge and from x to each chosen vertex. Operation Ak is a\nspecial Henneberg construction. Operation Bk is to choose s \u2265 2 distinct edges\nand k \u2212 s \u2212 1 \u2265 0 distinct vertices, subdivide each of the chosen vertices, and\nadd an edge from every subdivision vertex to every other subdivision vertex and\nto every chosen vertex. Operation Ck is to choose k vertices, add a new vertex\nx, and add an edge from x to every chosen vertex. Here is Dawes's construction\ntheorem for minimally 3-connected graphs [5, Theorem 6] [6]:\nTheorem 6.5 The class of minimally 3-connected graphs is the class of graphs\nobtained from K4 by finite sequences of operation A3 , B3 , C3 at suitable sets of\n13 By\n\na Theorem of Dirac [8], every graph of minimum degree at least 3 contains a subdivision\nof K4 .\n14 The resulting graph is always 2-connected, and it is not too difficult to characterise the\nsuitable pairs for which the result is minimally 2-connected.\n15 As an easy consequence, we get the well-known theorem on ear-decompositions, that every\n2-connected graph can be obtained from a cycle by subsequently attaching paths of length at\nleast 1 to suitable pairs of vertices: If G is any 2-connected graph non-isomorphic to a cycle\nthen its simple subdivision is minimally 2-connected and Dirac's Theorem gives us a path\nwhich corresponds to a path P in G such that deleting all its elements except its endvertices\nproduce a smaller 2-connected graph.\n\n15\n\nJune 12, 2018\n\n\fobjects.16\nTheorem 6.5 implies the following reduction theorem for minimally 3-connected\ngraphs [5, 6]:\nTheorem 6.6 Every minimally 3-connected graph non-isomorphic to K4 can\nbe reduced to a smaller minimally 3-connected graph by homotopically deleting\nedges or deleting vertices.\nTheorem 6.5 'literally' holds for minimally 1- and 2-connected graphs; however,\nnote that the preconditions of A1 , B1 , and B2 cannot be fulfilled, so that we\nget back the well-known fact that the minimally 1-connected graphs are the\nnon-trivial trees, and that the class minimally 2-connected graphs is the class\nobtained from K3 by finite sequences of subdivisions (A2 ) and attaching paths of\nlength 2 (which follows from Dirac's theorem). Dawes conjectured in [5, p. 287]\nthat these facts plus Theorem 6.5 generalise to generator theorems for minimally\nk-connected graphs for each k \u2265 4 but also noticed that the 'compatibility\ncondition' characterizing the suitable sets of objects would become much more\ndifficult. - However, let us disprove his conjecture:\nTheorem 6.7 For each k \u2265 4, there are infinitely many minimally k-connected\ngraphs which do not arise from a smaller minimally k-connected graph by operation Ak , Bk , or Ck .\nProof. First note that Ak generates a k-connected graph only if all chosen edges\nare independent and not incident with the chosen vertices (otherwise the new\nvertex will have less than k neighbors). Bk generates a k-connected graph only\nif the chosen edges are not incident with the chosen vertices (otherwise some\nsubdivision vertex will have less than k neighbors). For all three operations, the\ndegree at the endvertices of the chosen edges does not change after application,\nand the degree of each chosen vertex increases by at least one. Moreover, Bk\ngenerates graphs with triangles unless s + k \u2212 s \u2212 1 \u2264 2, so unless k \u2264 3.\nFor k \u2265 4 it follows that if a k-regular k-connected graph arises from some\n(minimally) k-connected graph G by applying Ak , Bk , or Ck then it must arise\nby applications of either Ak to G and t = k2 independent edges where k is even,\nor Bk with s = k \u2212 1 distinct edges (no vertices are chosen).\nConsequently, for odd k \u2265 5, every k-regular k-connected graph which arises\nfrom some (minimally) k-connected graph by Ak , Bk , Ck has to contain a triangle - but there are infinitely many triangle free k-regular k-connected graphs.\n16 Again, the graph resulting from applying A , B , or C to any set of objects meeting the\n3\n3\n3\ndefinition of the respective operation is 3-connected - but here it is much more difficult to\ncharacterise those sets which yield a minimally 3-connected graph. See [5, 6] for the details.\n\n16\n\nJune 12, 2018\n\n\fFor even k \u2265 4, let the graph H arise from a multicycle of length at least\n5 with edge multiplicity k2 by subdividing each edge once. Every edge of H\nis incident with precisely k others, two edges of H can not be separated by\nremoving less than k edges, and H is edge-transitive. Its line graph G = L(H) is,\nconsequently, k-regular, k-connected, and vertex-transitive. We can not obtain\nit from applying Ak (with s = k/2) to some minimally k-connected graph, since\nthe neighborhood of the new vertex as in Ak had to contain at least k2 pairwise\ndisjoint pairs of non-adjacent vertices - but this situation does not occur at\nany vertex of G. Up to isomorphism, there is a unique graph G\u2212 from which\nG arises by applying Bk (with s = k \u2212 1), but G\u2212 has a separating vertex set\nof order k2 + 1 < k. (G\u2212 can be obtained from G by contracting any complete\nsubgraph Kk to a single vertex.)\nTherefore, for even k \u2265 4, too, there are infinitely many minimally k-connected\ngraphs which do not arise from a smaller one by Ak , Bk , Ck .\n\u0003\nYet another approach to constructively characterise the k-connected graphs is\nSlater's concept of 'splitting and soldering' [70, 71, 72]. Let x be a vertex of a\ngraph G and A, B sets such that A \u222a B = NG (x). To split x into (a, b) according\nto (A, B) means to delete x from G, add two new vertices a, b and an edge from\na to b, and add an edge from a to every y \u2208 A and from b to every z \u2208 B. If\n|A|, |B| \u2265 k and |A \u2229 B| = 0 then we say that the new graph arises from G by\nk-vertex-splitting, and if |A|, |B| \u2265 k and |A \u2229 B| = 1 then we say that the new\ngraph arises from G by k-edge-splitting17 . In this terminology, for example, the\nclass of 3-connected (simple) graphs is the class of graphs obtained from K4 by\nfinite sequences of edge addition, 3-vertex-splitting, and 3-edge-splitting - as\na constructive version of the Wheel Theorem (Theorem 1.1).\nLet G be a graph and K be a complete subgraph of order k of G. To solder x on\nK means to add a new vertex x and an edges from x to every y \u2208 K to G, and\nto delete a certain set F of edges from E(K). If, in the new graph H, dH (x) \u2265 k\nfor all x \u2208 V (K) and (V (K), F ) = H[V (K)] does not contain a 4-cycle then we\nsay that H arises from G by k-soldering. The reason for excluding C4 here is to\nguarantee that H is k-connected if G is, which is otherwise not true in general\n[72]. The drawback of this operation is that G might contain a minor which is\nnot a minor of H.\nOne of the main results in [70] is that the class of 3-connected (simple) graphs\nis the class of graphs obtained from K4 by finite sequences of line addition and\n3-soldering. This does not similarly extend to 4-connected graphs: 4-connected\nline graphs of cubic graphs (see above) are examples that cannot be obtained\nfrom any smaller 4-connected graph by edge-addition, 4-vertex-splitting, 4-edgesplitting, or 4-soldering. Slater's solution to overcome this situation was to\ngeneralise the vertex splitting as follows. Let x be a vertex of a graph G and\nA1 , . . . , Ar sets such that A1 \u222a . . . \u222a Ar = NG (x). To split x into (a1 , . . . , ar ) according to (A1 , . . . , Ar ) means to delete x from G, add r new vertices a1 , . . . , ar )\n17 The\n\n'edge' to which this notion refers is the one connecting x to the vertex in A \u2229 B in G.\n\n17\n\nJune 12, 2018\n\n\fand all edges connecting any two of them, and add an edge from aj to every\ny \u2208 Aj , j \u2208 {1, . . . , r}. If |Aj | \u2265 k for every j \u2208 {1, . . . , r} and the Aj are\npairwise disjoint then we say that the new graph arises from G by r-fold kvertex-splitting. The following is the second main result from [70].\nTheorem 6.8 The class of 4-connected graphs is the class of graphs obtained\nfrom K5 by finite sequences of edge addition, 4-soldering, 4-vertex-splitting, 4edge-splitting, and 3-fold 4-vertex-splitting.\nA more recent reduction theorem for 4-connected graphs, due to Saito, uses\na special Henneberg reduction; these reductions have been very successfully\napplied in the context of edge-connectivity and aboricity questions. Let x be\na vertex of some graph G and let \u03c3 be a partition of EG (x) into classes of\n\u03c3\n\ncardinality 1 or 2. The graph G \u2212 x is the graph obtained from G \u2212 x by adding\na new edge18 between the endvertices distinct from x of each pair of edges e 6= f\nsuch that {e, f } \u2208 \u03c3, and we say that it arises from G by a Henneberg reduction\nof degree |\u03c3| at x. The nice feature when performing a Henneberg reduction\nof degree l at a vertex of degree 2l is that the degree function of the result is\nequal to the degree function of G on V (G) \u2212 {x}; in particular, when applied to\na k-connected graph, the resulting graph will have minimum degree at least k.\n\u03c3\nThe drawback is, as for soldering, that G \u2212 x might contain a minor which is\nnot a minor of G, and conversely. Here is Saito's Theorem (from [69, Theorem\n2]):\nTheorem 6.9 For every vertex x of a 4-connected graph G \u223c\n6 K5 , there exists\n=\na 4-contractible edge at distance at most 1 from x, or there exists a vertex y\nof degree 4 at distance 1 from x and a partition \u03c3 of EG (y) into two sets of\n\u03c3\n\ncardinality 2 such that G \u2212 y is 4-connected.\nAnother attempt to reduce a given 3-connected graph G to a smaller one is to\nhomotopically delete a vertex x, i. e. to delete x and then repeatedly suppress\nvertices of degree at most 2 as long as it is possible. This might do severe\ndamage to G: We could kill the entire graph, for example if G is a wheel and x\nis its center. The resulting graph is, however, well-defined [45], and denoted by\nG \u2212 \u2212x. Let us mention the main result from [45]:\nTheorem 6.10 Every 3-connected graph non-isomorphic to K3,3 , K2 \u00d7 K3 , or\na wheel can be reduced to a smaller 3-connected graph by homotopically deleting\na vertex.\nAlthough homotopic vertex deletion is by no means a 'bounded' operation, it\nstill has a constructive counterpart in terms of series parallel extensions [45]. As\n18 That\n\nmight be a loop.\n\n18\n\nJune 12, 2018\n\n\fthe homotopic deletion of vertices or edges can be considered as a (not constantly\nbounded) sequence of edge deletions, vertex deletions, or edge contractions, it\nstill would keep us in any class closed under taking minors.\nHere is an example of a contraction/deletion result for the class of triangle free\n3-connected graphs from [43]:\nTheorem 6.11 Every 3-connected triangle free graph non-isomorphic to K3,3\nor the skeleton of a 3-dimensional cube can be reduced to a smaller 3-connected\ntriangle free graph by at most six edge deletions, vertex deletions, or edge contractions.\nLet us finally mention a reduction theorem for bipartite graphs. Apart from\ntrivial situations, we would leave the class when contracting an edge in a bipartite graph. Instead of identifying a pair of non-adjacent vertices, I have\nsuggested to identify a pair of (non-adjacent) vertices of the same colour class,\nwhich led indeed to a reduction theorem [33, Theorem 4]:\nTheorem 6.12 Every k-connected bipartite graph on more than 2k 2 \u2212 2k + 2\nvertices and, for even k, non-isomorphic to a graph Cl [Kk/2 ] for some even\nl \u2265 4, can be reduced to a smaller k-connected bipartite graph by identifying two\ndistinct non-adjacent vertices.\nThe bound to the number of vertices is sharp for infinitely many k, as it is shown\nby the point-line-incidence graphs of projective geometries [33]. It is easy to see\nthat the 'irreducible' bipartite graphs in Theorem 6.12 for k = 2 are the cycles\nof even length, and in [33, Theorem 5] the nine irreducible graphs for k = 3\nhave been determined. It might well be that there are similar results for the\nclass of k-connected 3-colourable graphs or even generalizations to r-colourable\ngraphs where r > 3.\n\n7. Subgraph Deletion\nAll the previously considered local reduction problems can be reformulated as\nquestions for the existence of a subgraph X in some k-connected graph G such\nthat \u03ba(G \u2212 V (X)) > k \u2212 |V (X)| (alternatively: \u03ba(G \u2212 E(X)) > k \u2212 |E(X)|),\nwhere, in addition, X respects some size- or connectivity conditions, or, more\ngenerally, X belongs to a certain class H of graphs. For example, when asking\nfor a k-contractible edge in a graph G we ask for a subgraph X \u223c\n= K2 of G such\nthat \u03ba(G \u2212 V (X)) > k \u2212 2, and H would be the class consisting of K2 .\nAs we have seen, such an X need not to exist. Is there one which keeps the\nconnectivity high? Let us formulate this more precisely. Given a class H of\n19\n\nJune 12, 2018\n\n\fgraphs, does there exist a function f (k) such that every f (k)-connected graph\nG admits a subgraph X from H such that G \u2212 V (X) (alternatively: G \u2212 E(X))\nis k-connected?\nFor every non-empty finite graph class H, such an f obviously exists (take\nf (k) := k + max{|V (X)| : X \u2208 H}). Another obvious case in which f exists\nis that H contains a graph X which is contained in every sufficiently highly\nconnected graph19 .\nApart from this, there are also classes H for which the answer is not obvious.\nThomassen proved [78] that every (k + 3)-connected graph G has an induced\ncycle C such that G \u2212 V (C) is k-connected (see next section); that is, f (k) :=\nk + 3 will give a 'yes' to our question if H is the class of all cycles. On the other\nhand, not every infinite class H admits such an f , simply because there might\nbe highly connected graphs which do not contain objects from H as subgraphs\n(let H be, for example, the odd cycles). Therefore, a first step towards our\nquestion could be the more fundamental question of characterizing the graph\nclasses H such that every sufficiently highly connected graph contains a member\nfrom H as a subgraph. However, for these classes our problem is solved, as it\nhas been pointed out by K\u00fchn and Osthus [46, p. 30]:\nTheorem 7.1 Suppose that H is a class of graphs such that there is an l such\nthat every l-connected graph contains a member from H as a subgraph. Then, for\nevery k, there exists an fH (k) such that every fH (k)-connected graph contains a\nmember H of H such that G \u2212 V (H) (alternatively: G \u2212 E(X)) is k-connected.\nThis follows from Theorem 1 in [46] that the vertex set of every 211 3k 2 -connected\ngraph admits a partition into two sets A, B such that G[A], G[B] are k-connected\nand every vertex in A has at least k neighbors in B; any copy of H \u2208 H in G[A]\nwill do (cf. [46]).\nTherefore, we propose to exclude those graphs without subgraphs from H:\nProblem 7.2 Determine (the) classes of graphs H for which there is a highconnectivity-keeping-H-theorem, i.e.: For every k there exists an f (k) such that\nevery f (k)-connected graph G which contains a subgraph from H admits a subgraph X from H such that G \u2212 V (X) (alternatively: G \u2212 E(X)) is k-connected.\nTable 2 summarises the graph classes H for which a high-connectivity-keepingH-theorem in the sense of Problem 7.2 exists or is conjectured.\nThere is a number of conjectures and results of the same flavour. The first one\nleads us back to contractibility. By Theorem 6.2, every 3-connected graph nonisomorphic to K4 contains a connected subgraph H on two vertices such that\n19 Any\n\nforest X is such a candidate, see, for example [1].\ntheta graph is any subdivision of the graph K4\u2212 , the complete graph on 4 vertices minus\na single edge.\n20 A\n\n20\n\nJune 12, 2018\n\n\fH\ncycles\neven cycles\nodd cycles\ntheta graphs20\nt-connected graphs\nas in Theorem 7.1\n\nf (k)\nk+3\nk+4\n?\nk+4\n4k + 4t \u2212 13\nk+t+1 ?\n211 3 max{k 2 , l2 }\n\nReference\nThomassen [78]\nFujita and Kawarabayashi [18]\nconj.

Thomassen [80, p. 167]\nK\u00fchn and Osthus [46]\n\nTable 2: Graph classes H for which a non-obvious high-connectivity-keeping\nH-theorem as in Problem 7.2 exists or is conjectured.\nG\u2212V (H) is 2-connected or, equivalently, that the graph obtained from G\u2212V (H)\nby adding a new vertex h and making it adjacent to all neighbors of V (H) in\nG is 3-connected. McCuaig and Ota conjectured the following generalization of\nthis [64]:\nConjecture 7.3 For every l \u2265 1 there exists an f (l) such that every 3-connected graph on at least f (l) vertices contains a connected subgraph H on l vertices\nsuch that G \u2212 V (H) is 2-connected.\nConjecture 7.3 is true for k \u2264 4, where the optimal values are f (2) = 5 [82],\nf (3) = 9 [64], and f (4) = 8 [34]. These values are sharp, and they are not\nmonotone in k. Moreover, every cubic 3-connected graph on at least 13 vertices\nhas a contractible subgraph on 5 vertices, and it is maybe interesting to see that\nthe 'local character' of the proof yields a generalization to 3-connected graphs\nof average degree at most 3 + 1/132 [44]. The conjecture is wide open in general.\nFor example, it is not known whether there exists a k such that its restriction\nto k-connected graphs is true. However, if we do not insist that H as in the\nstatement is connected, then there is a positive result [36]:\nTheorem 7.4 For every l \u2265 1 there exists an f (l) such that every 3-connected\ngraph on at least f (l) vertices contains a subgraph X on l vertices such that\nG \u2212 V (X) is 2-connected.\nIf we delete edges instead of vertices then there is the following positive result\nfrom [44] (based on a Theorem of Lemos and Oxley [47]): For every l \u2265 1\nthere exists an f (l) such that every 4-connected graph on at least f (l) vertices\ncontains a path or a star X on l vertices such that G \u2212 E(X) is 2-connected.\nMader generalised the statement of Theorem 7.4 to higher connectivity, as follows [59]:\nTheorem 7.5 For every k \u2265 4 and every l \u2265 2 there exists an fk (l) such that\n21\n\nJune 12, 2018\n\n\fevery k-connected graph on at least fk (l) vertices contains a subgraph X on l\nvertices such that G \u2212 V (X) is (k \u2212 2)-connected.\nIt is not possible to replace k \u2212 2 by k \u2212 1 here [59].\nThe possibly most prominent conjecture along these lines is Lov\u00e1sz's Conjecture\non high-connectivity keeping paths (cited according to [79, p. 267]):\nConjecture 7.6 For every k there exists an f (k) such that for any two vertices\na, b of any f (k)-connected graph G, there exists an induced a, b-path P in G such\nthat G \u2212 V (P ) is k-connected.\nThis conjecture has been verified for k \u2264 2, where f (1) = 3 and f (2) = 5 are\nbest possible (see [4], [38], and also [31]). Some years ago, I have suggested to\nfirst prove a version where we delete E(P ) instead of V (P ) and/or do not insist\nthat P is induced. There is recent progress on this, due to Kawarabayashi, Lee,\nReed, and Wollan [30]:\nTheorem 7.7 For every k there exists an f (k) such that for any two vertices\na, b of any f (k)-connected graph G, there exists an a, b-path P in G such that\nG \u2212 E(P ) is k-connected.\nIt is easy to see that an affirmative answer to Conjecture 7.6 would imply Theorem 7.7, even with the additional constraint that P is induced. It is not clear if\nthe 'non-induced' version of Conjecture 7.6 would imply Theorem 7.7. It might\nbe the case that Theorem 7.7 generalises as follows:\nConjecture 7.8 For every k there exists an f (k) such that every f (k)-connected graph contains a spanning tree T such that G \u2212 E(T ) is k-connected.\nThe edge-connectivity of this is obviously true, because every (2k + 2)-edgeconnected graph admits k + 1 edge-disjoint spanning trees, by a well-known\ncorollary of the base packing theorem by Tutte and Nash-Williams; removing\none of them yields a supergraph of the union of k edge-disjoint spanning trees\nand hence a k-connected graph. In particular, Conjecture 7.8 is true for k = 1,\nwhere f (1) = 4 is best possible. Jord\u00e1n proved that every 6k-connected graph\nG has k edge-disjoint 2-connected subgraphs, which shows that f (2) \u2264 12 [27].\nThe edge sets of these subgraphs are actually bases of the 2-dimensional rigidity\nmatroid of G. It might be that there is a way of proving conjecture 7.8 for larger\nk by using properties of the higher dimensional rigidity matroids of the graph\nin question, but these are objects which are far from being well understood [25].\n\n22\n\nJune 12, 2018\n\n\f8. Partitions under Connectivity Constraints\nAs an alternative to the notion of high-connectivity-keeping subgraphs, most\nof the previous results can be considered as partition statements: Given a sufficiently highly connected graph G with certain extra properties, we look for\na partition {A, B} of V (G) such that G[A] meets a 'small' or 'bounded' size\ncondition and, in many cases, a mild connectivity condition, whereas we want\nG[B] highly connected. In some cases, an additional condition to the location\nof A might be incorporated. For example, the presence of a contractible edge\nin a graph of connectivity k [incident with some vertex x] is equivalent to the\npresence of such a partition, where G[A] has order two and is connected [and\ncontains x], whereas G[B] needs to be (k \u2212 1)-connected.\nIn this section we look at a problem where the conditions to the partition sets\nare more balanced. Let me first mention Gy\u0151ry's classic characterization of the\nk-connected graphs [19].\nTheorem 8.1 A graph G is k-connected if and only if for\nPkany k distinct vertices\na1 , . . . , ak , and any k positive integers b1 , . . . , bk with i=1 bi = |V (G)|, there\nexist disjoint sets C1 , . . . , Ck \u2286 V (G) such that for all i \u2208 {1, . . . , k}, G[Ci ] is a\nconnected graph on bi vertices containing ai .\nThere are versions for digraphs and also for edge-connectivity instead of connectivity (see [19]). It is maybe surprising that this theorem has not been\nemployed so far to the type of problems we mentioned here; but, on the other\nhand, the same applies, basically, to Menger's theorem, as the vast majority of\nthe arguments run exclusively in terms of T (G). The reason might be that the\nnon-trivial part is the necessity of the partition conditon, i. e. we could apply\nthe theorem to the graph G under consideration but possibly not to certify a\ncertain connectivity of some substructure.\nThe following question is due to Thomassen [80] (cf. Table 2):\nConjecture 8.2 For every (s+t+1)-connected graph G, there exists a partition\n{A, B} of V (G) such that G[A] is s-connected and G[B] is t-connected.\nThe qualitative part of this question has been settled: The conclusion holds for\n(4s + 4t + 1)-connected graphs G [80]. The proof runs in three steps.\n(i) Since G has minimum degree at least 4s + 4t + 1, there exists a partition\n{A\u2032\u2032 , B \u2032\u2032 } of V (G) such that G[A\u2032\u2032 ] has minimum degree at least 4s and\nG[B \u2032\u2032 ] has minimum degree at least 4t, by a famous theorem of Stiebitz [73]. In particular, G[A\u2032\u2032 ], G[B \u2032\u2032 ] have average degree at least 4s, 4t\nrespectively.\n\n23\n\nJune 12, 2018\n\n\f(ii) By a Theorem of Mader [51] (see also [7]), the average degree bound from\n(i) ensures that G[A\u2032\u2032 ] has an s-connected subgraph and G[B \u2032\u2032 ] has a tconnected subgraph. That is, there exist disjoint subsets A\u2032 \u2286 A\u2032\u2032 and\nB \u2032 \u2286 B \u2032\u2032 such that G[A\u2032 ] is s-connected and G[B \u2032 ] is t-connected.\n(iii) Since G is (s + t \u2212 1)-connected, we can extend A\u2032 , B \u2032 to a partition of\n{A, B} of V (G) as desired, that is, A \u2287 A\u2032 , B \u2287 B \u2032 , and G[A] is sconnected and G[B] is t-connected; this is due to a beautiful argument of\nThomassen [80].\n(i) and (iii) show that the conclusion of Conjecture 8.2 holds also under the\nweaker assumption that G is (s + t \u2212 1)-connected and has minimum degree\n4s+4t+1. (iii) shows that for proving the conclusion of Conjecture 8.2 it suffices\nto find two disjoint subgraphs, which are s- and t-connected, respectively. By\ncareful consideration of the original bounds from Mader [51], which are slightly\nbetter than 4k, Hajnal improved the bound to 4s + 4t \u2212 13 for all s, t \u2265 3 [20].\nThere is also a version of Conjecture 8.2 where we partition E(G) instead of\nV (G), which has been posed by Mader in [54] as an open problem:\nProblem 8.3 Given s, t \u2265 2, does every (s + t)-connected graph admit a partition {A, B} of E(G) such that the graph formed by the edges of A is s-connected\nand the graph formed by those of B is t-connected?\nLet me sketch a proof for the qualitative part of it: Suppose that G is a (2s+4t)connected graph, or just any s-connected graph of average degree at least 2s+4t.\nThen G contains a minimally s-connected spanning subgraph H. As we have\nseen in Section 2, the average degree of H is less than 2s, so that the average\ndegree of G \u2212 E(H) is at least 4t. By Mader's Theorem, G \u2212 E(H) contains a\nt-connected subgraph T . Since S := G \u2212 E(T ) is a supergraph of H, it follows\nthat the edge sets of S and T partition E(G) in the desired way.\nThe first non-trivial case of Conjecture 8.2 has been settled by Thomassen [78]:\nTheorem 8.4 Every (k + 3)-connected graph G contains an induced cycle C\nsuch that G \u2212 V (C) is k-connected.\nThe proof is by induction on V (G) of the stronger statement that there is an\ninduced cycle C such that every vertex not in V (C) has at most 3 neighbors\nin V (C) (such that G \u2212 V (C) is k-connected). Obviously, every triangle would\nserve as such a C, so that we may assume that G is triangle free. By Theorem\n5.3, G contains a contractible edge e. From a cycle in G/e with the desired\nproperties it is the easy to obtain one in G. - Along these lines, let me also\npoint to Mader's result that every (k + 2)-connected graph contains a cycle C\nsuch that G \u2212 E(C) is k-connected [52, p. 190]. In fact, C can be taken as an\ninduced cycle here.\n24\n\nJune 12, 2018\n\n\fIt seems to be extremely difficult to prove local versions of this statement. For\nexample, the statement that 'there is a function g such that every for every edge\ne of every g(k)-connected graph G there exists an induced cycle C containing e\nsuch that G \u2212 V (C) is k-connected' is equivalent to Conjecture 7.6, as has been\nobserved by Thomassen. Even the following, weaker problem, is open:\nConjecture 8.5 For every k, there exists an h(k) such that every for every vertex v of every h(k)-connected graph G there exists an induced cycle C containing\nv such that G \u2212 V (C) is k-connected.\nIt might be that partition problems as in Conjecture 8.2 or 8.5 are easier to\nsolve on graphs with high girth.21 This is supported by the following facts\nconjectured by Thomassen and proved by Egawa [10] [12]:\nTheorem 8.6 Let k \u2265 2.\n1. Every (k + 2)-connected triangle free graph G contains an induced cycle C\nsuch that G \u2212 V (C) is k-connected.\n2. Every (k + 1)-connected graph G of girth at least 5 contains an induced\ncycle C such that G \u2212 V (C) is k-connected.\nLet us look at the case that s = t = k in Conjecture 8.2. Hajnal's Theorem\nimplies that the vertex set of every (8k \u2212 13)-connected graph G has a partition\ninto two sets A, B such that G[A], G[B] are k-connected. This improves by\nalmost a factor of 2 if we restrict the statement to graphs of girth larger than\nk: By [51, Korollar 2], every graph with \u03b4(G) \u2265 2k \u2212 2 and girth g(G) > k\ncontains a k-connected subgraph; therefore, following the (i)-(ii)-(iii)-argument\nright after Conjecture 8.2, the vertex set of every (4k \u2212 3)-connected graph\nwith g(G) > k has a partition into two sets A, B such that G[A], G[B] are kconnected. In fact, for k = 3 it is possible to use [51, Satz 1], with n = 3 and\n\u03bd = \u22121, in part (ii) of the argument, which then yields that the vertex set of\nevery 9-connected graph without an induced subgraph K4\u2212 22 has a partition\ninto two sets A, B such that G[A], G[B] are 3-connected. Also for the (i)-part\nof the argument, there are improvements for graphs of high girth: Whereas the\ngeneral bound resulting from Stiebitz's Theorem is s + t + 1, the vertex set of\nevery triangle-free graph of minimum degree at least s + t can be partitioned\ninto A, B with \u03b4(G[A]) \u2265 s and \u03b4(G[B]) \u2265 t [29], and the bound s + t can\nbe improved once more to s + t \u2212 1 for graphs of girth at least 5 [9]. (As\na consequence, the vertex set of every 8-connected triangle-free graph can be\npartitioned into A, B such that G[A], G[B] are 3-connected.)\n21 The\n22 K \u2212\n4\n\ngirth g(G) of a graph G is the length of a shortest cycle and +\u221e if G is a forest.\nis obtained from K4 by deleting a single edge.\n\n25\n\nJune 12, 2018\n\n\fAlso for large graphs, the bound in Mader's Theorem in (ii) of the argument\nright after Theorem 8.2 improves: It follows from\u221a[51, Satz 4] that every sufficiently large graph of average degree at least (2 + 2) * k contains a k-connected\nsubgraph. As we have no control on the size of the partition classes when applying Stiebitz' result in (i) of the argument, this statement does not improve the\nbound of 4(s + t) + 1 for large graph immediately. However, if it would be true\nthat (*) for n, s, t there exists a f (n, s, t) such that every graph G of minimum\ndegree s + t + 1 with |G| \u2265 f (n, s, t) admits a partition {A\u2032\u2032 , B \u2032\u2032 } of V (G) such\nthat G[A\u2032\u2032 ] has average degree at least s, G[B \u2032\u2032 ] has average degree at least t,\nand |A\u2032\u2032 |, B \u2032\u2032 | \u2265 n, then we get the following:\n\u221a\nTheorem 8.7 For s, t, n there exists f (s, t, n) such that for every (2 + 2)*(s+\nt) + 1-connected graph G with |G| \u2265 f (s, t, n), there exists a partition {A, B} of\nV (G) such that G[A] is s-connected and G[B] is t-connected.\nA (probabilistic) proof of (*) has been announced by Carmesin and et al. [3].\n\n9. Line Graphs\nMost of the problems mentioned in Section 7 and 8 provide an (often literal)\nanalogous version in terms of edge-connectivity (instead of connectivity). The\nanswers are often affirmative, mostly due to the presence of enough edge-disjoint\nspanning trees. (See, for example, the paragraph right after Conjecture 7.8).\nMoreover, it is straightforward to translate these results on graphs into the\nlanguage of their line graphs: For example, the fact that for any two vertices\na, b of an f (k)-edge-connected graph G there exists an a, b-path P such that\nG \u2212 E(P ) is k-edge-connected immediately implies that for any two edges e, f\nof an (f (k) + 2)-edge-connected graph G there is a path with terminal edges\ne, f such that G \u2212 E(P ) is k-connected; consequently, in the line graph L(G),\nbetween any two vertices there exists an induced path P such that L(G) \u2212 V (P )\nis k-connected. One is tempted to say that this proves Lov\u00e1sz's Conjecture,\nConjecture 7.6, for line graphs - but this is not true, because a high-edgeconnectivity of some graph is sufficient but not necessary for high connectivity\nof its line graph23 . However, it is easy to see that if L(G) is k-connected then\nthe vertices of degree at least k in G are k-edge-connected in G [38]. This\nobservation has been combined with a powerful theorem on removable paths\nin graphs with a given edge-connectivity function by Okamura [66], in order to\nfinally prove that Lov\u00e1sz's Conjecture is true for line graphs [38].\nLet us give another example of how to employ this method. We prove Conjecture\n7.8 for line graphs.\n23 Think\n\nof pendant edges.\n\n26\n\nJune 12, 2018\n\n\fTheorem 9.1 Every (12k+11)-connected line graph has a spanning tree T such\nthat G \u2212 E(T ) is k-connected.\nProof. Let G be any graph such that L(G) is (6k + 6)-connected and L(G) has\nminimum degree at least 12k + 11. By [38, Lemma 1], the set A of vertices of\ndegree at least 6k + 6 in G is (6k + 6)-connected, and since L(G) has minimum\ndegree at least 12k+11, G\u2212A is edgeless. By [17, Theorem 3.1], G admits 2k+2\nedge-disjoint trees such that each of them covers A. Therefore, there exists k + 1\nedge-disjoint connected subgraphs G T1 , . . . , Tk such that each of them covers\nA, every vertex of A has degree at least 2 in every Tj , and E(T1 ), . . . , E(Tk+1 )\npartitions E(G).\nFor each vertex x \u2208 V (G), let Kx be the clique on EG (x) in L(G), and for each\nx \u2208 V (G), let Kxj be the subclique induced by ETj (x) in Kx .\n\nFor each x \u2208 A, take mx such that |Kxm | = max{|Kxj | : j \u2208 {1, . . . , k + 1}}.\nThen Kxm is a clique on at least 4 vertices and, thus, has a non-separating\nspanning path Mxmx . For each j 6= mx , there exists a matching Mxj in Kx such\nthat each edge of Mxj connects a vertex from V (Kxj ) to a vertex from V (Kxmx )\nand each vertex of V (Kxj ) is connected this way. The graph Hx1 formed by\nSk+1\nj\n1\nj=1 E(Mx ) \u222a E(Kx ) is, therefore, a connected spanning subgraph of Kx such\nthat, for each j 6= 1, the graphs Hxj := Kxj \u2212 E(Hx1 ) are connected and for every\nvertex e \u2208 V (Kx ) and every j such that e 6\u2208 V (Hxj ) there exists an edge in\nE(Kx ) \u2212 E(Hx1 ) connecting e to some vertex in V (Hxj ).\nS\nS\nLet H j := x\u2208V (G)\u2212A Kxj \u222a x\u2208A Hxj .\nWe claim that for e 6= f \u2208 L(G), there exists an e, f -path in H 1 and k openly\ndisjoint e, f -paths in L(G) \u2212 E(H 1 ) (*), which proves the theorem. There\nexists x, y \u2208 A such that e \u2208 V (Kx ) and f \u2208 V (Kx ), e \u2208 V (Ky ). If x = y\nthen there exists an e, f -path in H 1 as Hx1 is a spanning connected subgraph\nj\nof Kx . Let je , jf \u2208 {1, . . . , k + 1} such that e \u2208 V (Kxje ), f \u2208 V (Kxf ). Take\nsje := e, rjf := f , for each j 6= je take a vertex sj \u2208 NKx \u2212E(H 1 ) (e) \u2229 V (Kxj ),\nand for each j 6= jf take a vertex rj \u2208 NKx \u2212E(H 1 ) (e) \u2229 V (Kxj ). For j 6= 1, there\nexists an sj , rj -path Lj in Kxj \u2212 E(H1 ), and as the Lj are disjoint by definition,\nthe paths eLj f are openly disjoint e, f -paths, which proves (*). If x 6= y then\nlet Pj be any x, y-path in Tj , and let Qj be the path induced by E(Pj ) in L(G).\nBy construction, E(Q1 ) \u2286 E(H 1 ) and E(Qj ) \u2229 E(H 1 ) = \u2205 for all j 6= 1. Since\nthe Qj are edge disjoint, the Pi are disjoint. Each Pj connects a vertex ej from\nV (Kxj ) to a vertex fj from V (Kyj ). By construction, there exists an e, ej -path\nRj such that Rj \u2212 e is in Hxj and an fj , f -path Sj such that Sj \u2212 f is in Hyj .\nIt follows that S1 Q1 R1 is an e, f -path in H 1 and that Sj Qj Rj for k 6= 1 are k\nopenly disjoint paths in L(G) \u2212 E(H 1 ).\n\u0003\nAnother example is that also Conjecture 8.2 is true for line graphs, simply\nbecause a line graph of minimum degree s + t + 1 contains Ks+1 or Kt+1 as\na subgraph. Let me finally mention the main result from [32] that there is no\n27\n\nJune 12, 2018\n\n\f3-con-critically k-connected line graph (which implies Slater's conjecture from\n[63] that there is no 3-critically k-connected line graph).\n\nReferences\n[1] B\u00e9la Bollob\u00e1s.
