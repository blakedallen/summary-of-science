These\nadvances provide an important capability for the implementation of functional quantum optical\nnetworks and precision atomic spectroscopy near dielectric surfaces.\nPACS numbers:\n\nAn exciting frontier in quantum information science is\nthe integration of otherwise \"simple\" quantum elements\ninto complex quantum networks [1]. The laboratory realization of even small quantum networks enables the exploration of physical systems that have not heretofore\nexisted in the natural world. Within this context, there\nis active research to achieve lithographic quantum optical circuits, for which atoms are trapped near micro- and\nnano-scopic dielectric structures and \"wired\" together by\nphotons propagating through the circuit elements. Single atoms and atomic ensembles endow quantum functionality for otherwise linear optical circuits and thereby\nthe capability to build quantum networks component by\ncomponent.\nCreating optical traps compatible with the modal geometries of micro- and nano-scopic optical resonators and\nwaveguides [2, 3] is a long-standing challenge in AMO\nphysics [4\u20136]. 'Optical tweezers' with tight focussing\nhave succeeded in trapping single atoms within small volumes \u223c \u03bb3 [7], but the focal geometries of conventional\noptical elements are not compatible with atomic localization ' 100 nm near microscopic photonic structures\n[2, 3]. Moreover, spatially inhomogeneous energy shifts\nU (r) on a sub-wavelength scale generally depend on the\natomic internal state, limiting long-lived trap and coherence times [8]. Nevertheless, important advances have\nbeen made by loading ultracold atoms into hollow-core\noptical fibers [9\u201313] and by trapping atoms in the evanescent fields of nanoscale waveguides [14\u201322].\nFollowing the landmark realization of a nanofiber trap\n[19\u201321], in this Letter we report the implementation of a\nstate-insensitive, compensated nanofiber trap for atomic\nCesium (Cs), as illustrated in Fig. 1 [23]. For our\ntrap, differential scalar shifts \u03b4Uscalar between ground\nand excited states are eliminated by using \"magic\" wavelengths for both red- and blue-detuned trapping fields\n[24]. Inhomogeneous Zeeman broadening due to vector light shifts \u03b4Uvector is suppressed by way of pairs of\ncounter-propagating red- and blue-detuned fields.\nThe compensation of scalar and vector shifts results in\na measured transition linewidth\u0393/2\u03c0 = 5.7 \u00b1 0.1 MHz\n\nFIG. 1: Adiabatic trapping potential Utrap for a stateinsensitive, compensated nanofiber trap for the 6S1/2 , F = 4\nstates in atomic Cs outside of a cylindrical waveguide of radius a = 215 nm [23].

[14\u201317] and the demonstrations in Refs. [19\u201321].\nA dielectric fiber in vacuum with radius a smaller than\na wavelength supports the \"hybrid\" fundamental mode\nHE11 , which carries significant energy in its evanescent\nfield [25]. For linear input polarization at angle \u03c60 , an\nappropriate combination of attractive and repulsive HE11\nfields creates a dipole-force trap external to the fiber's\nsurface with trap minima at \u03c6 \u2212 \u03c60 = 0, \u03c0.\nFollowing these principles, we have designed a \"magic\ncompensation\" scheme that traps both ground and excited states and greatly reduces the inhomogeneous\nbroadening for atomic sublevels [23]. By contrast, uncompensated schemes do not provide a stable trapping\npotential for excited states and suffer large dephasing\nbetween ground states over a single vibrational period\n[19\u201321].\nAs shown in Fig. 1, our trap consists of a pair of\ncounter-propagating x-polarized red-detuned beams at\nthe \"magic\" wavelength [24] \u03bbred = 937 nm to form an\nattractive 1D optical lattice. A second pair of beams at\nthe \"magic\" wavelength \u03bbblue = 686 nm with detuning\n\u03b4blue provides a repulsive contribution to Utrap , thereby\nprotecting the trapped atoms from the short-ranged attractive surface interaction. To avoid a standing wave\nincommensurate with that at 937 nm, the blue-detuned\nbeams have a relative detuning \u03b4f b = 382 GHz and effectively yield linearly polarized light at all positions; vector\nlight shifts are suppressed by \u03b4f b /\u03b4blue ' 4 \u00d7 10\u22123 [23].\nThe resulting potential Utrap allows for state-insensitive,\n3D confinement of Cs atoms along a SiO2 nanofiber for\n\nthe 6S1/2 ground and 6P3/2 excited states.\nWe calculate the adiabatic potential Utrap in Fig. 1\nfrom the full light-shift Hamiltonian (i.e., scalar, vector,\nand tensor shifts), together with the surface potential\nfor Casimir-Polder interactions with the dielectric [23].\nThe red-detuned beams each have power 0.4 mW, while\nthe blue-detuned beams each have power 5 mW. The\ntrap depth at the minimum is Utrap = \u22120.27 mK located\nabout 215 nm from the fiber surface, with trap frequencies {w\u03c1 , wz , w\u03c6 }/2\u03c0 = {199, 273, 35} kHz.\nAn overview of our experiment is given in Fig. 2. A\ncloud of cold Cesium atoms (diameter \u223c 1 mm) spatially overlaps the nanofiber. Cold atoms are loaded into\nUtrap during an optical molasses phase (\u223c 10 ms) and are\nthen optically pumped to 6S1/2 , F = 4 for 0.5 ms. The\nred- and blue-detuned trapping fields are constantly 'on'\nthroughout the laser cooling and loading processes with\nparameters comparable to those in Fig. 1.\nFor the transmission and reflection measurements, the\ntrapped atoms are interrogated by a probe pulse (1 ms)\nwith frequency \u03c9P , optical power Pprobe ' 0.1 pW and\ndetuning \u03b4 = \u03c9P \u2212 \u03c9A relative to the F = 4 \u2194 F 0 = 5\ntransition frequency \u03c9A . The probe pulse is combined\nwith the forward propagating trapping fields by a pair\nof Volume Bragg Gratings (VBGs) at the fiber input.\nThe strong trapping beams are then filtered by a pair of\nVBGs at the fiber output, with the transmitted probe\npulse monitored by a single-photon avalanche photodiode. The polarization of the probe laser is aligned along\nthe trapping beams in order to maximize the overlap with\nthe trapped atoms. We then shelve the atoms to F = 3\nwith a depumping pulse, and probe the fiber transmission with a reference pulse to determine the input power\nof the probe pulse.\nAs described in the Appendix A, the polarizations\nof the trapping and probe beams are aligned by observations of Rayleigh scattering [19]. From a simple\nmodel of the results in Fig. 2 (b, c), we infer a trans~ in (z = 0) = (Ex , iEy ) with\nverse polarization vector E\n\u03b2 = arctan(Ey /Ex ) ' 12 \u00b1 3\u25e6 for the probe beam. The\nprincipal axes of the polarization ellipse rotate in an approximately linear fashion along z in the trapping region\nby an angle \u03c6(z) ' \u03c60 + (d\u03c6(z)/dz)\u03b4z, where \u03c60 ' 16\u25e6\nand d\u03c6(z)/dz ' 12\u25e6 /mm. These results are incorporated\ninto our analysis of the measured transmission and reflection spectra of the trapped atoms (Appendix B).\nThe lifetime of the atoms in our nanofiber trap is determined from the decay of the resonant optical depth\ndN ' N \u03c30 /Aeff as a function of storage time \u03c4 . Here,\nN is the number of trapped atoms, \u03c30 is the resonant\nabsorption cross-section, and Aeff = Pprobe /Iprobe (~rmin )\nis the effective optical mode area of the probe's evanescent wave. We observe that dN decays exponentially\nwith time constant \u03c40 = 12 \u00b1 1 ms. With pulsed\npolarization-gradient cooling, the lifetime is extended to\n\u03c4PG = 140 \u00b1 11 ms. We are currently characterizing the\nintensity and polarization noise spectra of the trapping\nfields to reduce parametric heating [26] with the goal of\n\n\f3\n\n(a)\n\n1.0\n0.8\n\n(i)\n\n0.6\n\n(ii)\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n\n(b)\nPabs (nW)\n\nextending the trap lifetime towards the limit \u03c4r \u223c 30 s\nset by recoil heating.\nFig. 3(a) displays the transmission spectra T (N ) (\u03b4) for\nthe 1D atomic array. The linewidth \u0393 = 5.8 \u00b1 0.5 MHz\nis determined from a model (solid black line) incorporating fiber birefringence and linear atomic susceptibility (Appendix B) in the low density regime (\u03c4 = 299\nms). The fitted line profile (solid red line) yields a maximum resonant optical depth dN = 66 \u00b1 17 at \u03c4 = 1\nms (Appendix B). Significantly, our magic, compensated\nscheme has no discernible shift of the transition frequency\n\u2206A /2\u03c0 ' 0 \u00b1 0.5 MHz relative to the free-space line\ncenter. The measured linewidths from 4 data sets average to \u0393/2\u03c0 ' 5.7 \u00b1 0.1 MHz, as compared to the\nfree-space radiative linewidth \u03930 /2\u03c0 = 5.2 MHz for the\n6S1/2 \u2194 6P3/2 transition. By contrast, for a noncompensated scheme without magic wavelengths for Cs\n[19], the transition frequency is shifted by \u2206A /2\u03c0 ' 13\nMHz and the linewidth is broadened to \u0393/2\u03c0 ' 20 MHz.\nThe broadening of the absorption linewidth above \u03930 is\npredicted for our nanofiber trap because of the enhanced\natomic decay into the forward and backward modes of the\nnanofiber at rate \u03931D [27]. We estimate that an atom\nat the minimum of Utrap decays into the fiber at rate\n(th)\n\u03931D /2\u03c0 ' 0.35 MHz, leading to a predicted linewidth\n\u0393tot /2\u03c0 ' 5.3 MHz. Additional broadening arises from\nthe tensor shifts of the excited 6P3/2 , F 0 = 5 manifold\n(' 0.7 MHz) and Casimir-Polder shifts (' 0.1 MHz), as\nwell as technical noise of the probe laser (' 0.3 MHz).\nWhile each of these contributions is being investigated in\nmore detail, the spectra in Fig. 3 provide strong support\nfor the effectiveness of our state-insensitive, compensated\ntrapping scheme [23].\nTo determine the number of trapped atoms, we carry\nout a saturation measurement at a storage time \u03c4 = 1\nms with \u03b4 = 0 MHz. As shown in Fig. 3(b), we measure\nthe power Pabs absorbed by the trapped atomic ensemble\nin the limit of high saturation s = P/Psat \u001d 1 [19]. As\ndescribed in the Appendix C, the fitted curve (blue solid\nline) yields a number of trapped atoms N = 224 \u00b1 10.\nTogether with the optical depth dN = 18, we find an\noptical depth per atom d1 = 7.8 \u00b1 1.3% for Fig. 3(b)\n[28]. A similar measurement presented in the Appendix\nC with dN = 43 \u00b1 10 and N = 564 \u00b1 92 yields d1 =\n7.7 \u00b1 2.2%. These measurements of d1 and \u0393tot were\nseparated by four months and yield consistent results for\nthe nanofiber trap. We thereby estimate \u03931D /2\u03c0 ' 0.2\n(th)\nMHz [29], similar to \u03931D .\nThe reflection from the 1D atomic array results from\nbackscattering of the electromagnetic field within the 1D\nsystem [29]. The randomness in the distribution of N\natoms among nsites trapping sites can thus greatly affect\nthe reflection spectrum RN (\u03b4). In Fig. 4(a), we observe\nRN (\u03b4) from the 1D atomic array, where the measured\nLorentzian linewidth \u0393R is significantly broadened from\n\u03930 for large N (with N \u001c nsite ).

From\nfits to T (N ) (\u03b4) (full curves), we obtain the optical depths dN\nat \u03b4 = 0 and linewidths \u0393 from a model that incorporates\nthe polarization measurements in Fig.2 (b),(c) (Appendix B).\nT (N ) (\u03b4) (i) at \u03c4 = 299 ms with dN = 1.2 \u00b1 0.1 and \u0393 =\n5.8 \u00b1 0.5 MHz and (ii) at \u03c4 = 1 ms with dN = 66 \u00b1 17.\n(b) Measurement of the power Pabs absorbed by the trapped\natoms as a function of input power Pin , together with the\nassociated optical depth dN = 18 \u00b1 2 from curve (ii) (red\nline) of the inset, allow an inference of N = 224 \u00b1 10 [19].\nThe linewidth \u0393 = 5.5 \u00b1 0.4 MHz and dN = 1.1 \u00b1 0.1 are\ndetermined from curve (i) (black line) of the inset.\n\nIn order to quantify the microscopic state of disorder\nfor the system, we define an entropy S for the 1D atomic\nsite !\narray by S = ln Wm (\u03c8), where Wm (\u03c8) = N !(nnsite\n\u2212N )!\nis the multiplicity for the atomic distribution in the 1D\nlattice. In Fig. 4(b), we find that the measured reflection linewidth \u0393R (colored points) as well as the linewidth\n\u0393th\nR (black points) from the numerical simulation are proportional to the entropy S of the site-population statistics. These results demonstrate the strong modification\nof RN (\u03b4) due to randomness in the atomic distribution.\nIn conclusion, we have trapped atoms along a nanofiber by using a state-insensitive, compensated optical\ntrap [23] to achieve an optical depth dN ' 66. Compared\nto previous work with hollow-core and nano-fibers, the\natoms are trapped with small perturbations to dipoleallowed transitions.

The vibrational ground state for\naxial motion in Utrap can be reached by introducing Raman sidebands on the 937 nm trapping fields [33]. The\nstrong axial confinement in our trap implies the presence\nof a large anharmonicity in the vibrational ladder, which\ncould provide a tool for experiments with single phonons.\nFurthermore, the design principles of our magic, compensated trap can be extended from simple 'nanowires' to\ncomplex photonic crystal structures [3].\nWe gratefully acknowledge the contributions of D.\n\n\u22126\n\n\u22124\n\n\u22122\n\n0\nz (mm)\n\n2\n\n6\n\n4\n\n240\n220\n200\n180\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n5\n6\nsample number\n\n7\n\n8\n\nFIG. 5: (a) The radius r(z) as a function of axial coordinate\nz from SEM measurements for a set of 8 fiber tapers.

(c) Spatially resolved visibility V as a\nfunction of axial position z.\n\nthe fiber axis. For the radiation pattern I(\u03c6) \u2248 sin2 (\u03c6)\nof a dipole induced by linearly polarized light, no light\nshould be detected along the direction that the dipoles\noscillate (\u03c6 = 0, \u03c0). Since the HE11 mode has a nontransversal polarization along the fiber axis z, a polarizer (PBS) is placed in front of a CCD camera to block\nz-polarized light. By rotating the angle \u03b8 for the input\npolarization of the probe field with the half-waveplate\n(\u03bb/2) shown in Fig. 6(a), a sinusoidal modulation of the\nscattering intensities I(z, \u03b8) is observed along the z axis\nof the fiber. From I(z, \u03b8), we determine the visibility\nmax \u2212I(z,\u03b8)min\nV (z) = I(z,\u03b8)\nI(z,\u03b8)max +I(z,\u03b8)min as a function of z along the\nnanofiber as shown in in Fig. 6(c).\nTo describe these measurements, we use a simple model\nbased upon z-dependent birefringence in the fiber that\nresults in elliptical polarization for the transverse fields\nEx,y along z. From Fig. 6(b) in the region of the\natom trap, we deduce that the principal axes of the\npolarization ellipse rotate along z by an angle \u03c6(z) '\n\u03c60 + (d\u03c6(z)/dz)\u03b4z, where \u03c60 describes a possible offset\nfrom the symmetry axes of the trap (i.e., the direction\n\u03c6 = 0 in Fig. 1) and (d\u03c6(z)/dz) = 12\u25e6 /mm gives the\nvariation from this offset along z. From fits to transmission spectra described in the next section, we find that\n\u03c60 ' 16\u25e6 .\nFig. 6(c) makes clear that there is a wide range\nof visibility values V (z) for the probe beam along\nz. For our simple model, we determine the ellip~ x,y (z) =\nticity of the transverse polarization vector E\n(Ex (z), iEy (z)), which we describe by the phase \u03b2(z) =\narctan(Ey (z)/Ex (z)). Absent trapped atoms, the principal axes for the polarization ellipse also rotate by angle\n\u03c6(z) along the nanofiber. From fits to transmission spectra, we find that fixed \u03b2(z) = \u03b20 provides an adequate\ndescription of our measurements, with \u03b20 ' 12 \u00b1 3\u25e6 determined along the high-visibility region in Fig. 6(c).\n\n0.2\n0.0\n\n-40\n\n-20\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n(MHz)\n(N )\n\nFIG. 7: Measured transmission spectra Tx (red points) and\n(N )\nTy (black points) for x, y polarizations of the probe beam\nas functions of the detuning \u03b4 from the |F = 4i \u2194 |F 0 = 5i\ntransition. From theoretical fits of our model (full curves)\nthat include the interplay of spatially varying birefringence\n(as in Fig. 6) and of atomic absorption and dispersion along\nthe nanofiber, we infer an optical depth dN = 18 \u00b1 2 with\npolarization offset \u03c60 = 16\u25e6 \u00b1 3\u25e6 and \u03b20 = 12\u25e6 .\n\nAppendix B: Optical depth estimation\n\nTo model the combined effects of the linear atomic susceptibility (i.e., absorption and dispersion) together with\nthe spatially varying birefringence along the nanofiber,\nwe divide the region 0 6 z 6 L into M 'cells' each\nof length \u03b4z = L/M . Propagation through a cell at\nzj \u2212 \u03b4z/2 6 zj 6 zj + \u03b4z/2 is generated by the product\nof two transfer matrices: (1) R\u0302(\u03c6(z)) produces rotation\nof the polarization axes from \u03c6(zj ) to \u03c6(zj ) + \u03b4\u03c6, with\n\u03b4\u03c6 = (d\u03c6(z)/dz)\u03b4z, and (2) T (\u03b4, dM ) specifies the propagation of Ex (zj ), Ey (zj ) through the trapped atoms with\ndetuning \u03b4 and optical depth dM for the x, y polarizations. Here dM = dN /M is the optical depth of a single\ncell, and dN is the optical depth for the entire sample\nof N atoms. For each cell, we take the ratio of resonant\noptical depths to be d0,x /d0,y = 2.5 at the trap minimum\nrmin = 215 nm, given by the asymmetry of the evanescent\nHE11 fiber mode [21], where x, y refer to the coordinates\nfor the trap axis as in Fig. 1.\nIn correspondence to the results from Fig. 6(b, c), the\ninput polarization to this sequence of cells is set to be\nelliptically polarized with angle \u03b20 and offset \u03c60 . After\npropagation through the fiber in the absence of atoms,\nour experimental procedure is to compensate the state of\nthe output polarization with the transformation matrix\nR\u0302out to maximize the polarization contrast for the photodetection after a polarization beamsplitter aligned along\nx, y. Hence, in our model, a final rotation R\u0302out follows\npropagation through the M cells before projection of the\n\n\f6\n1.0\n\nin Fig. 8, we find dN = 43 \u00b1 10 and \u03c60 = 16\u25e6 \u00b1 9\u25e6 for\n\u03b20 = 12\u25e6 .\nThe theoretical fits to the transmission spectra shown\nin Fig. 2 have been obtained by applying this model.\nFrom these and other fits to the measured transmission\nspectra, we have consistently found that \u03c60 ' 16\u25e6 \u00b1 2\u25e6\nwith fixed \u03b20 = 12\u25e6 .
