A star can\nretain much of its planetary system as it leaves the main sequence and evolves through the\n1\n\nSpitzer Science Center, MS 220-6, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91125\n\n2\n\nNASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD 20771\n\n3\n\nDepartment of Astronomy, University of Texas, 1 University Station C1400, Austin, TX 78712\n\n4\n\nDepartment of Astronomy and Steward Observatory, University of Arizona, 933 North Cherry Avenue,\nTucson, AZ 85721\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nred giant stage. Although the inner \u223c 5 AU of a planetary system may evaporate within the\nred giant atmosphere and planets that were in marginally stable orbits may escape during\nstellar mass loss, most outer planets and even much of the Oort-cloud-like extremities of\nplanetary systems should persist around white dwarfs (Debes & Sigurdsson 2002).\nThe white dwarf Giclas 29-38 (WD 2326+049; G29-38 hereafter) has garnered intense\ninterest since Zuckerman & Becklin (1987) discovered infrared emission from this object far in\nexcess of the photosphere. The excess emission, confirmed both by ground-based (Tokunaga\net al. 1990) and space-based (Chary et al. 1999) observations, begins to deviate from a\npure photosphere in the near-infrared. While it was initially speculated that a Jupiter-sized\ncompanion could supply all the infrared excess, follow-up observations (e.g. Kuchner et\nal. 1998, Graham et al. 1990) appear to have ruled this out. The colors measured with\nISOCAM suggested the infrared excess is due to particulate matter rather than a brown\ndwarf companion (Chary et al. 1999).\nBesides strong hydrogen absorption lines, G29-38 has some photospheric metal lines,\nincluding Ca II which should rapidly (< 104 yr) sink out of the atmosphere due to gravitational sedimentation (Alcock & Illarionov 1980; Koester et al. 1997; Zuckerman & Reid\n1998). Possible explanations for the atmospheric metals and the infrared excess include interstellar medium (ISM) accretion (Dupuis et al. 1993; Koester et al. 1997; Zuckerman &\nReid 1998), cometary breakup (Alcock et al. 1986), and asteroid disruption (Jura 2003).\nWe turned the powerful instruments of the Spitzer Space Telescope (Werner et al. 2004)\ntowards G29-38 to measure its brightness from 4.5\u201324 \u03bcm. These observations probably\nprobe a planetary system in a late stage of evolution. G29-38's main sequence progenitor\nwas probably an A star with mass approximately 3.1 M\u2299 (Weidemann 2000), similar to\nmany stars known to have debris disks and potential planetary systems (Rieke et al. 2005).\nThe post-AGB phase age is estimated to be \u223c 5 \u00d7 108 yr (Bergeron et al. 1995a).\n\n2.\n\nObservations\n\nFigure 1 shows the spectral energy distribution of G29-38. Observations with the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) (Fazio et al. 2004) were performed on 2004 Nov 26 10:54 UT.\nAt each of five dithers in a Gaussian spatial distribution, a 30 sec frame was taken with the\n4.5 and 8 \u03bcm arrays. We extracted our photometry using the method (Reach et al. 2004)\nused for the IRAC calibration stars. The quoted 4.5 and 8 \u03bcm fluxes, measured from the\nbasic calibrated data, are 8.8 \u00b1 0.3 and 8.2 \u00b1 0.3 mJy, respectively. We calculated color\ncorrections of 0.995 and 1.17 in the 4.5 and 8 \u03bcm channels, making the estimated fluxes 9.2\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n\nFig. 1.- Spectral energy distribution of the white dwarf G29-38 from the ultraviolet through\ninfrared. The infrared observations are described in \u00a72 and the ultraviolet through nearinfrared observations and model are described in \u00a73. The solid line through the infrared\ndata is a modified blackbody fit to the continuum.\nand 7.0 mJy at the IRAC nominal wavelengths of 4.493 and 7.782 \u03bcm. Observations with\nthe Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer (MIPS) (Rieke et al. 2004) were performed\non 2004 Dec 2 04:45 UT. Three cycles of small-scale photometry dithers were taken with 10\nsec frames (total exposure time 420 sec); the flux at 24 \u03bcm is 2.4 mJy.\nObservations with the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) (Houck et al. 2004) were performed\non 2004 Dec 8 3:26 UT. The source was first observed on the blue-filter portion of the peak-up\narray; the flux measured from the 16 \u03bcm peak-up image is 3.7 mJy. The spectrum from 5.2\nto 14.4 \u03bcm was assembled by differencing observations at two nods on each of the 4 spectral\norders. The flux derived from the IRS spectrum convolved with the IRAC 8 \u03bcm bandpass\nis consistent with the IRAC flux.\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nThe IRS spectrum shows continuum emission and a strong 9\u201311 \u03bcm feature characteristic of silicate minerals. It shows none of the bands at 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, 11.3, or 12.6 \u03bcm characteristic of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that normally dominate mid-infrared spectra of the\nISM. The excess emission above photospheric is approximated by two modified blackbodies\nwith temperatures 890 K and 290 K and dilution factors (at 10 \u03bcm wavelength) 4.2 \u00d7 10\u221216\nand 6.3 \u00d7 10\u221215 , and emissivity proportional to \u03bd 0.5 . These functions are only intended as\nmathematical approximations of the continuum shape.\n\n3.\n\nModeling\n\nWe adopt the following basic parameters for G29-38. It is a DA4 type white dwarf, with\natmospheric spectrum dominated by H lines (Green et al. 1986). It has an assumed mass of\n0.69 M\u2299 , surface gravity log g = 8.14, and temperature 11, 800 K (Bergeron et al. 1995b).\nThe parallax is \u03c0 = 0.071\u2032\u2032 + / \u2212 0.004\u2032\u2032 (Harrington & Dahn 1980), implying a distance of\n14 pc.\nWe assembled the spectral energy distribution from the IUE low-dispersion spectrum\ncovering 0.115\u20130.3148 \u03bcm (Holberg et al. 2003) and a model atmosphere for T = 12, 000 K\nand log g = 8 covering 0.35\u201360 \u03bcm (courtesy D. Koester). We used the 2MASS photometry\n(J = 13.132 \u00b1 0.029, H = 13.075 \u00b1 0.022, Ks = 12.689 \u00b1 0.029) and optical spectrophotometry from Palomar (Greenstein & Liebert 1990) for normalization, giving extra weight\nto the 2MASS J-band photometry, the longest-wavelength where we think the photosphere\ndominates. The integrated luminosity of the star is 2 \u00d7 10\u22123 L\u2299 .\nThe 9\u201311 \u03bcm emission feature indicates silicates. Figure 2 compares the shape of the\nG29-38 silicate feature to that of interstellar dust (Kemper et al. 2004), Solar System zodiacal\nlight, the O-rich mass-loss from the star Mira (Sloan et al. 2003), and comet Hale-Bopp\n(Crovisier et al. 1997). The G29-38 silicate feature is redder than that of the ISM, which has\na single, rounded peak at 9.7 \u03bcm and nearly linear slopes on either side. This suggests that\nthe material around G29-38 is not accreted interstellar matter but rather is indigenous to\nthe star. The G29-38 silicate feature is more compact than the zodiacal light silicate feature\nas well as the exozodiacal light around \u03b2 Pic feature (Reach et al. 2003). The Hale-Bopp\nspectrum has a prominent 11.3 \u03bcm peak that is not seen in the G29-38 spectrum. The Mira\nsilicate feature is somewhat redder and wider than the ISM feature, roughly intermediate\nbetween the ISM and G29-38 feature shape. The G29-38 silicate feature shape is most\nsimilar to (and approximately intermediate between) those of Mira and the zodiacal light,\nbut the line-to-continuum ratio of G29-38 is much greater than that of the zodiacal light\n(125% versus 6%) suggesting a very different particle size distribution.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nWe computed theoretical emission spectra for grains (size a =0.01\u20131000 \u03bcm, dn/da \u221d\na ) of various compositions (amorphous carbon, crystalline enstatite, amorphous pyroxene\n[50/50 Mg/Fe], amorphous olivine [50/50] and crystalline forsterite) around G29-38 to further\nelucidate the properties of the dust around that star. The temperatures and emissivities over\na range of distances (0.003\u20133.5 AU = 0.6\u2013750 R\u2299 ) from the white dwarf were integrated over\na spherical, presumed-optically-thin shell with a radial profile n \u221d r \u2212\u03b1 and an inner cutoff\nat Rmin . The temperatures of 0.5 \u03bcm radius grains of amorphous carbon (olivine) are 600\nK (920 K) at 3 R\u2299 and 130 K (110 K) at 1 AU from the white dwarf. Grains hotter than\n1500 K are presumed sublimated and are not included in the emissivity. Since we assume\nthe cloud is optically thin, we cannot further constrain the geometry of the emitting region,\nwhich could range from a spherical shell to a flattened disk.\n\u22123.5\n\nThe G29-38 silicate feature resembles the amorphous olivine model, with excess on the\nred side that can be accounted for by mixing in forsterite. Pyroxene can not contribute\nsignificantly to the observed spectrum; its 9\u201311 \u03bcm feature is too blue. Amorphous olivine\nand fosterite alone cannot explain the spectrum, however, because it cannot emit at 3\u20136 \u03bcm\nwithout also producing a 1.6 \u03bcm feature that exceeds the near-infrared H-band flux. The\nnear-infrared continuum shape at these wavelengths matches the amorphous carbon model.\nThe contrast of the silicate feature demands a particle size distribution that favors small\nparticles, unlike that of interplanetary dust grains (Gr\u00fcn et al. 1985). On the assumption\nthat all the particles participate in the same collisional evolution, we assume that silicate\nand carbon particles share the same size distribution.\nThe distance of the emitting region from the star is constrained as follows. In order to\nproduce significant emission at 5 \u03bcm, we require Rmin < 5R\u2299 . The best-fitting models all\nrequire small Rmin , implying that the dust exists nearly up to its sublimation temperature.\nThe radial profile shape requires high \u03b1, suggesting the emitting region extends from 1\u201310 R\u2299\nfrom the star. Figure 3 shows the observed spectrum and the best-fit model. Experiments\nwith other geometries yielded similar results: a face-on slab required \u03b1 \u223c 3, Rmin \u223c 2.5R\u2299 .\nA dust cloud this small is consistent with the measurements of Kuchner et al. (1998) that\nshowed G29-38 to be unresolved in K-band at 55 mas (160 R\u2299 ) resolution.\n\n4.\n\nConclusions\n\nA cloud of small grains 1\u201310 R\u2299 from G29-38 creates its mid-infrared emission. The\nluminosity of the infrared excess is 3% of the luminosity of the star, high by the standards\nof debris disks, indicating nontrivial disk opacity in the ultraviolet-visible range.\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nOur models suggest a dust grain abundance ratio (by number) of olivine:carbon:forsterite\nof 5:12:2. Considering only the atoms in these grains, assuming material densities of 2.2 and\n2.5 g cm\u22123 for the amorphous carbon and silicates, the abundance ratio (by number) of C:O\nis 3:1. The total dust mass required to generate the observed mid-infrared flux is of order\n1018 g; a larger mass could be present if there are larger, cooler grains that do not contribute\nto the observed flux. This inferred mass corresponds to that of a \u223c10 km diameter asteroid\nor comet, slightly less than that of the interplanetary dust responsible for the zodiacal light\nin the Solar System (Fixsen & Dwek 2002).\nWhere could this dust cloud have come from? It was not generated by the white dwarf\n(by any known mechanism), nor is it likely to be planetary system material that was at\nthis location before the star was a red giant, whose atmosphere extended much further than\nthe current dust cloud. The silicate feature is suggestive of dust formed in O-rich mass-loss\nduring the red giant or AGB phase, but the presence of significant and comparable amounts\nof silicate and carbonaceous dust (and no PAH) does not seem compatible with such dust,\nwhich in any event could not have survived at 10 R\u2299 from the star. The material must\nhave been transported inward. If the material originates from the planetary system of the\nprogenitor, then gravitational perturbations would occasionally send smaller bodies close to\nthe star. If the small body is collisionally fragmented, or loses mass by cometary sublimation,\nor breaks apart by thermal or gravitational stress, the Poynting-Robertson effect will cause\nparticles of radius a (\u03bcm) and distance r (R\u2299 ) to spiral into the star on timescales of 4r 2 a yr,\ni.e. a few years for material contributing to the mid-infrared emission. The particles would\ncontinue toward the star until they sublimate, suffer mutual collisions, disrupt, with part of\nthe material landing in the photosphere, part being blown out of the system by radiation\npressure, and part remaining on bound orbits. If the entire mid-infrared-emitting mass (i.e.\nparticles out to \u223c 10R\u2299 ) were lost in the Poynting-Robertson timescale, the accretion rate\nis of order 1015 g yr\u22121 . This flow could be supplied by collisional comminution of debris\nfrom an asteroidal and cometary cloud like the one in the Solar System Sykes & Greenberg\n(1986). This mass loss rate is comparable to the 'high' ISM accretion scenario calculated\nby (Dupuis et al. 1993), which appears inconsistent with G29-38's present location in a low\ndensity ISM environment.\nA plausible model for the infrared excess around G29-38 involves the tidal disruption\nof an asteroid near the white dwarf (Graham et al. 1990; Jura 2003). Since short-period\ncomets are composed largely of refractory material, we generalize this model to include\nthe tidal disruption of a comet. Comets are commonly observed to pass near the Sun, so\nby analogy a surviving reservoir of comets (and possibly a surviving massive outer planet)\nwould inevitably lead to star-grazing cometary passages. With its low luminosity, the white\ndwarf would not drive a high sublimation rate for star-grazing comets, reducing the related\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nstresses that appear to cause Sun-grazing comets to split. Comets may then travel rather\nclose to the white dwarf, where they could be disrupted by tidal forces. Our new observations\nsupport this model, since the emitting region lies close to the star, where a large solid body\nwould be tidally disrupted. Based on the high C/O ratio in the dust, it is also conceivable\nthat the 'comet' was condensed out of the AGB mass-loss (Kuchner & Saeger 2005). The\ndetails of the tidal disruption model presented here are different from previous papers which\nassume larger grains and an optically thick disk. If the emitting region is a disk, it is either\noptically thin or it is viewed relatively face-on, with the line of sight from the white dwarf\nto the Sun relatively free of dust. For a thin disk to absorb 3% of the luminosity of the\nstar it would have to be opaque in the ultraviolet, where there is no evidence of significant\nextinction and no 2175 \u00c5 absorption bump in the IUE spectrum.\nAn alternate and long-standing model for both the photospheric metals and the infrared\nexcess is dredge-up and mass loss. There are already difficulties with dredge-up models associated with the need for vertical velocities that are at odds with G29-38's g-mode pulsations\nthat are overwhelmingly horizontal. Further, standard white dwarf models are layered from\nprior nuclear burning; hypothetical mixing from the pulsations would have to reach many\norders of magnitude below the convection zone boundary, well below even the degeneracy\nboundary (about 10\u22126 M\u2299 ) to dredge up material from the C/O layer (presumably around\n10\u22123 M\u2299 or deeper). Further, the dredge-up hypothesis cannot explain the abundant silicates;\ninvoking these materials just below the He-layer is very difficult to accommodate within our\ncurrent understanding of nuclear burning of He in post-main sequence stars appropriate to\nwhite dwarf stars in the mass range of G29-38. Our observations therefore argue that the\nobserved material was not formed in the white dwarf; it formed well outside its current\nposition.\nThe presence of a dust cloud around G29-38 is likely related to the anomalous presence\nof metals in its photosphere. As discussed by Zuckerman et al. (2003), the photospheric\nmetals could be accreted from interstellar gas, but then the star would need to be within a\ndense cloud (because the lifetime of metals in the photosphere [< 104 yr] is smaller than the\ncrossing time of a dense cloud [& 104 yr]), which is not true for G29-38. The other major\nmodel for white dwarf photospheric metals is cometary impact (Zuckerman & Reid 1998;\nDebes & Sigurdsson 2002). Based on the presence of a strong silicate feature and the overall\nmid-infrared spectral energy distribution, we believe this latter model prevails for G29-38.\nThe abundance of photospheric metals for G29-38 is among the highest of any white dwarf,\nand the infrared excess is also the highest of any known white dwarf. Another white dwarf,\nWD 1337+705 (G 238-44), with even higher atmospheric Ca abundance (Zuckerman et al.\n2003) does not show infrared excess at the level seen in G29-38 in our Spitzer photometric\nsurvey of white dwarfs at 4.5 and 8 \u03bcm. It is possible that a recent disruption of an asteroid\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nor comet has occurred in G29-38, re-populating the star's dust cloud at a level much higher\nthan the long-term steady state, as indeed occurs in debris disk around main sequence stars\n(Rieke et al. 2005) and the Solar System (Sykes & Greenberg 1986).\nAre there planets around G39-38? The 9\u201311 \u03bcm spectral feature proves there is a cloud\nof small silicate grains. We ascribed the 3\u20136 \u03bcm continuum to amorphous carbon dust, and\nthe carbon-silicate mix matches the spectral energy distribution, but there is no spectral\nsignature for carbon other than its color temperature. If we ascribe the 890 K continuum\nto a planet, then it must be not only very hot but also very large, with radius 0.2 R\u2299 -an\nextremely unusual object. If the dust cloud is indeed due to an asteroid or comet, perhaps\nother, cooler planets await discovery around the fascinating star G29-38.\nThis work is based in part on observations made with the Spitzer Space Telescope, which\nis operated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under NASA\ncontract 1407.
