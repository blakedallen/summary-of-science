Introduction\n\n2\n\nThe magnetic confinement of burning hydrogenic plasma is of primary concern to those interested in the production of power from nuclear fusion. The most popular approach is based on\nthe tokamak design (Luxon, 2002), in which a current is driven through an ionized gas within\na toroidal confinement vessel surrounding a central coil by transformer action. Some geometric\nnomenclature and useful coordinate relations are given in the Appendix. The vacuum vessel is encircled by poloidal coils which produce the toroidal magnetic field, and the toroidal plasma current\nproduces the poloidal magnetic field. The mathematical description of the device is generally based\non that of plasma physics, which in principle is a marriage of kinetic mechanics and electrodynamics. In practice, however, the standard description of the plasma phase of matter neglects one very\nimportant equation, thus introducing mathematical inconsistency to the model.\nDifferent authors use the term \"neoclassical\" to mean different things; most often it is applied\nto theories of particle transport in toroidal geometry, as opposed to \"classical\" transport in an\naxial geometry. We prefer to use the term to include all theories of ionized media which are nonclassical by construction, ie not based on the potential formulation of electrodynamics, whereby\nthe so-called quasineutral approximation (which is not an approximation but rather an assumption\non the mathematical form of the theory) requires the use of an equation of motion to determine\nthe electric field rather than Gauss's law or Poisson's equation (Chen, 1984; Dendy, 1993; Wesson,\n2004). Plasma theorists have been neglecting Gauss's law since the advent of the topic's selfidentification as a separate branch of physics (Rose and Clark, 1961; Braginskii, 1965), which may\n\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n\nEmail address: robjohnson@alphawaveresearch.com (Robert W.

Please forgive\nthe thoroughness of the presentation, which addresses the arguments made by various colleagues\nin defense of the neoclassical approach. At issue is the validity of the quasineutral approximation,\nwhichP\nallows for a divergenceful electric field in the absence of a non-vanishing space charge density\n\u03c1e \u2261 s ns es , formally expressed as \u2207 * E 6= 0 for \u03c1e = 0, and requires the determination of the\nelectrostatic field from an equation of motion. However, the quasineutral approximation does not\nrespect the mathematics of electrodynamic field theory,\n\u2207 * E = \u03c1e /\u03b50 .\n\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n52\n53\n54\n55\n56\n57\n58\n59\n60\n61\n62\n63\n64\n65\n\n(1)\n\nFrom a particle physicist's perspective (Davis, 1970; Ryder, 1985; Halzen and Martin, 1985; Ramond,\n1990; Mandl and Shaw, 1993), the gauge invariant Maxwell field tensor F \u03bc\u03bd \u2261 \u2202 \u03bc A\u03bd \u2212 \u2202 \u03bd A\u03bc is\nknown to carry only 3 scalar degrees of freedom in media, not 3 for each of the electric and magnetic fields, embodied by the four-potential A\u03bc \u2261 (\u03a6/c, A) subject to the gauge condition and\ncoupled to sources given by the conserved four-current J \u03bc \u2261 (c\u03c1e , J) through the inhomogeneous\nMaxwell equations \u2202\u03bd F \u03bc\u03bd = \u03bc0 J \u03bc , while the homogeneous equations are recognized as the Bianchi\nidentity for electromagnetism given by the field equation for the dual tensor \u2202\u03bd Fe \u03bc\u03bd = 0 and are\nsatisfied identically when written in terms of the electromagnetic potential hence do not determine\nany degrees of freedom, thus the electrostatic field is determined by the space charge density \u03c1e\nand not by an equation of motion. The equations by Maxwell may be expressed succinctly using\nintrinsic, geometric notation as d \u2217 d A = J in terms of the exterior derivative d, the Hodge dual\n\u2217 , the connection 1-form A, and the current 3-form J, as given in many standard quantum field\ntheory texts, such as Ryder (1985), or more esoteric monographs, such as Davis (1970). What that\nexpression states is that Gauss's law may not be isolated from the remainder of the source bearing\nMaxwell field equations, \u2207 \u00d7 B \u2212 \u03bc0 \u03b50 \u2202E/\u2202t = \u03bc0 J, as they are but one unit of truth.\nNote that we are not criticizing the kinetic approach to plasma calculations, which in its original\ninception as the Vlasov-Maxwell system (Vlasov, 1968) fully respects the microscopic electrodynamic field theory, but rather the neoclassical (non-classical) fluid model based on the quasineutral\napproximation, which does not respect the macroscopic electrodynamic field theory. While various\napproximations are made in the drift kinetic equations (Hinton and Rosenbluth, 1973; Lin et al.,\n1995), most practical numerical evaluations address Poisson's equation directly (Belli and Candy,\n2008). With this article, we examine in detail the mathematical difficulties one encounters when\nfollowing the neoclassical prescription. Similar discussions on the existence of the whistler oscilliton in geophysical plasmas (McKenzie et al., 2005, 2007; Verheest, 2007a,b) and of the helicon\nwave in propulsion devices (Johnson, 2009; Walker and Yano, 2009) are noted. Criticism of the\nquasineutral approach in a cosmological context has also recently appeared (Teodoro et al., 2008;\nDiver and Teodoro, 2008), and it is time for the fusion community to address these difficulties head\non.\nWe close by considering an alternate model for the production of electric fields within toroidal\nconfinement devices based upon the physics of macroscopic electromagnetism. Relaxing the requirement of equilibrium slightly indicates that changes to the kinetic pressure distribution (for\nconstant net pressure) produce changes to the plasma magnetization which induce an electric field\nby Faraday's law. Regions of opposite variation experience a mutually repulsive force, which may\nbe a source of plasma instability not previously recognized in the literature.\n2\n\n\f66\n\n2.

The\nuse of concentric circular flux surfaces with a toroidal integrating measure is pursued herein to\nremain consistent with the model as presented in the literature, as are the expansions in \u01eb \u2261\nr/R0 of the electron density ne = n0e (r)[1 + nce (r) cos \u03b8 + nse (r) sin \u03b8] and electrostatic potential.\ne c,s \u2261\nStacey and Groebner (2008) state that \"the electron momentum balance can be solved for \u03a6\nc,s\nc,s\n0\n\u03a6 /\u01eb = ne /\u01eb(e\u03a6 /Te ), which represents the poloidal asymmetry in the electrostatic potential.\"\nLet us examine that statement in detail.\n\n77\n\n2.1.

The terms with factors of \u01eb above are strictly due to the toroidal geometry\nand would disappear for a cylindrical plasma column R0 \u2192 \u221e; one cannot address the extension\nto toroidal geometry of other aspects of the model (Stacey and Sigmar, 1985) without addressing\n3\n\n\f92\n93\n94\n95\n96\n97\n98\n\n99\n\nthe extension here. Solution in pairs given finite (fixed) \u03a60 yields inconsistent values of \u03a6c,s and\nan overdetermined system, which therefor has no solution, thus the poloidal electrostatic field in\nthis neoclassical model, which fails to consider the O(\u01eb) terms within the cosine and sine moment\nequations, is unphysical. Failing to include the O(\u01eb) terms indicates expressions applicable only on\nthe magnetic axis r = 0, where \u01eb = 0 for R0 6= \u221e, yet this neoclassical model is commonly used\nto address the physics near the edge of the confinement region (Stacey and Groebner, 2008).

The matrix A\nhas rank 3, thus the solution has 0 free parameters (Schneider and Barker, 1989). For a cylindrical\n0\n0\ncolumn \u01eb \u2192 0, one recovers a matrix of rank 2 and the solution \u03a6c,s = nc,s\ne (Te /e\u03a6 ) with \u03a6 a\nfree parameter. If one assumes that the smallness of the coefficients may be represented by \u01eb, eg\nnc,s\nnc,s\ne \u2261 \u01ebe\ne , then the offending terms near the edge where \u01eb approaches 1/2 represent up to a\n19% correction to the leading order equations. As non-vanishing \u03a6c,s are an integral part of the\ndevelopment of this neoclassical model and appear in its remaining equations without a prefactor\nof \u03a60 through substitution, the validity of its conclusions is in jeopardy. Note that a putative nonvanishing radial electrostatic field without poloidal variation demands the existence of no poloidal\nelectrostatic field, else the poloidal variation to the potential ruins the poloidal symmetry of the\nradial field; if that radial field is determined from a radial equation of motion then the associated\npoloidal field is determined by the poloidal dependence of that equation.\nOne might think to alleviate the difficulty by invoking the logarithmic derivative, writing\nthe electron poloidal equation of motion as \u2202(ln ne \u2212 e\u03a6/Te )/\u2202\u03b8 = 0, with solution C(r) =\nne (r, \u03b8) exp[\u2212e\u03a6(r, \u03b8)/Te (r)]. Expanding the exponential gives, for \u2212\u221e < e\u03a6/Te < \u221e,\nC(r) = ne\n\n\u221e\nX\n(\u2212e\u03a6/Te )k\nk=0\n\n116\n117\n118\n119\n120\n121\n122\n123\n124\n125\n126\n127\n\n(8)\n\nk!\n\n(9)\n\nand to each order in e\u03a6/Te , taking the flux surface moments yields three equations to solve.\nThe difficulty with \u03a60 encountered above has simply been shifted to the \"undetermined\" function\nC(r), which is perfectly determinable in principle from the system of equations. As the electron\ndensity n0e divides out of Equation (4), its poloidal variations nc,s\ne are determined by continuity\nh\u2202ne /\u2202t + \u2207 * ne Ve \u2212 \u1e45e iC,S = 0 for particle source rate \u1e45, and the thermal energy Te is determined\nby the heat equation and given as input from experimental measurement for the analysis; the\nremaining degree of freedom \u03a60 must be determined by C(r). Concern over the expansion in no\nway detracts from the observation that the physics of the situation is embodied by the algebraic\nEquation (7) which contains no exponential factor thus represents a more exact method of solution.\n2.2.

The harmonic potential for the toroidal Laplacian \u22072tor \u2261 \u22072axi + \u2202/R\u2202R is written \u03a6tor = \u03a6axi (R \u2192 ln R), from which EZ = \u2212\u03a60 [(ln R\u2212R0 )/2R02 \u22122/R0 ] and ER = \u2212\u03a60 Z/2RR02 ,\nnoting that the introduction of the logarithm breaks the usually obvious relation between the symbol for the magnitude of a quantity and the units associated with that quantity-carefully pulling\nthe units beside the leading coefficients of expressions ensures that they are respected.

As this is an\nelectrostatic field within a neutral medium (ie one for which the net charge on a differential volume\nelement vanishes) at equilibrium, Maxwell's equations \u2207 \u00d7 E = 0 and \u2207 * E = 0 are satisfied within\nthe bulk region.\nThe Pfirsch-Schl\u00fcter current is supposed to flow along the electrostatic field of this section\nto cancel the charge accumulation arising from the pressure gradient driven diamagnetic current\nJ\u2207p = \u2212\u2207p \u00d7 B/B 2 in toroidal geometry (Wesson, 2004). For the harmonic potential, these\ncharges accumulate on the boundary of the region under consideration, which in this case is the\nR/R0 weighted circle representing our outermost flux surface at normalized minor radius r/a = 1\nupon collapse of the toroidal dimension, writing \u2212\u2202\u03c1\u2207p /\u2202t = \u2207tor * J\u2207p 6= 0.

However, J\u2207p is but one\ncomponent of the total diamagnetic current, properly defined as the curl of the magnetization\nJdia \u2261 \u2207 \u00d7 M where M \u2261 \u2212(p/B 2 )B, which includes the effects of the pressure gradient driven\ncurrent as well as the curvature and \u2207B drift currents (Hazeltine and Waelbroeck, 2004) and\nremains divergence-free regardless of the geometry \u2207 * Jdia \u2261 0, thus there is no space charge\naccumulation and no motivation for a canceling current. (The common procedure of adding the\nparticle drift currents to the fluid diamagnetic current we feel represents an over-counting of the\nunderlying phenomenon, as all currents are the curl of either an H or an M .) The error here\nlies in not fully distinguishing the free and bound charges and currents as they appear in the\nHeaviside notation of the Maxwell equations and in trying to model a fully ionized medium as both\na conductor and dielectric at zero frequency.\n\n200\n\n4. Dynamic electric field\n\n201\n\nRelaxing our requirement of equilibrium slightly, we consider now the effect of a shift in the\nmagnetic flux density when the total magnetic flux remains constant. This effect may possibly\naccount for the direct experimental observations of an electric field within the device (Cortes et al.,\n2003; Holcomb et al., 2006). As Gauss's law is inviolate, any electric fields within the neutral,\nconducting medium of a tokamak plasma necessarily are driven by changes in the magnetic flux\ndensity at some location in space, giving us\n\n189\n190\n191\n192\n193\n194\n195\n196\n197\n198\n\n202\n203\n204\n205\n206\n\n\u2207 * E = 0 , \u2207 \u00d7 E = \u2212\u2202B/\u2202t .\n207\n208\n209\n210\n211\n\n(22)\n\nThese changes may result for fixed H\u03c6 by a shift in the pressure distribution leading to \u2202M\u03c6 /\u2202t 6= 0,\nas B/\u03bc0 = (H \u2212 M )\u0125.

Conclusions and outlook\n\n232\n\nFrom the preceding analysis, we find that the use of an equation of motion to determine the\nequilibrium electrostatic field rather than Poisson's equation leads to formal inconsistencies in\nthe model. Part of the problem lies in treating the poloidal and radial components of the field\n\n228\n229\n\n233\n234\n\n8\n\n\fZ\n\u03c6\nRr\nr\n\n\u03b8\n\nR\n\nFigure 2: Tokamak coordinates (r, \u03b8, \u03c6) and cylindrical coordinates (Z, R, \u03c6).\n\n255\n\nseparately, when there is only one electrostatic potential from which both components may be determined. The remainder lies in the neglect of Gauss's law popularly established within the plasma\nphysics community (Goldston and Rutherford, 1995; Kivelson and Russell, 1995; B\u00fcchner et al.,\n2003; Kallenrode, 2004; Dinklage et al., 2005), which relegates the defining relation for the electrostatic field to a position of subsidiary moment. Any model which treats the plasma as a neutral,\nconducting fluid, where neutrality is understood to hold down to some scale smaller than the differential volume element used to define the continuum quantities, needs to respect all of Maxwell's\nlaws, which are manifestly Lorentz covariant. Taking a field theoretic perspective implies that\nthe electrostatic field within a neutral medium must either vanish or result from sources and be\nsupported by dielectric polarization.\nIn conclusion, we have found that neither neoclassical model for the equilibrium electrostatic\nfield within a tokamak respects the mathematics of electrodynamic field theory. An alternative\nmodel relating changes in pressure to changes in magnetization may explain observations of an\nelectric field during experiments. The potential formulation is becoming widely recognized as more\nfundamental even at the classical level, while the macroscopic field formulation can be just as useful\nfor the description of nonlinear media as for linear ones. The thrust of our argument is simply that,\nif there is an electric field within a tokamak, then it must follow the same rules as every other\nelectric field found in nature. The most reductionist description of macroscopic phenomena must\ngive a complete accounting of the quantities for current J, momentum K, charge potential A, and\nmass potential G all living on a space-time X. Elucidating that system of equations remains a\ntopic of wide interest.\n\n256\n\nAppendix A. Useful relations\n\n257\n\nThere are (at least) three useful sets of coordinate axes to describe a toroidal magnetic confinement device with concentric circular flux surfaces as shown in Figure 2, namely (\u1e90, R\u0302, \u03c6\u0302),\n\u02c6 k\u0302), and in the infinite aspect ratio limit (R0 \u2192 \u221e) we have the axial coor(r\u0302, \u03b8\u0302, \u03c6\u0302), and (r\u0302, \u22a5,\ndinate axes (\u1e90, R\u0302, \u1e91) and (r\u0302, \u03b8\u0302, \u1e91). Note that the term \"toroidal coordinates\" means something\nvery different to a mathematician than those commonly applied to a tokamak, which we call \"tokamak coordinates.\" For a plasma with coaxial applied electric and magnetic fields and free current\ndriving a circulating field, we note that (r\u0302, \u03b8\u0302, \u1e91) = (\u2212E \u00d7 B/EB, \u2212E \u00d7 (E \u00d7 B)/E 2 B, E/E) and\n\u02c6 k\u0302) = (\u2212E \u00d7B/EB, \u2212B \u00d7(E \u00d7B)/EB 2 , B/B). Cylindrical coordinate labels (Z, R, \u03c6) relate\n(r\u0302, \u22a5,\nto tokamak coordinates (r, \u03b8, \u03c6) via Z = \u2212r sin \u03b8 and R = R0 + r cos \u03b8 in the concentric circular\n\n235\n236\n237\n238\n239\n240\n241\n242\n243\n244\n245\n246\n247\n248\n249\n250\n251\n252\n253\n254\n\n258\n259\n260\n261\n262\n263\n264\n265\n\n9\n\n\f266\n267\n268\n269\n270\n271\n272\n273\n\n274\n\napproximation, where r\u0302, \u03b8\u0302, and \u03c6\u0302 give the radial, poloidal, and toroidal directions, respectively.\nThe outermost minor radius of the confined plasma, given in meters by a, defines the normalized\nminor radius r/a, and Ra is its centroid.\nThe magnetic field B and current density J lie in isobaric surfaces given by \u2207p = J \u00d7 B for a\nstationary equilibrium, defining the \"flux surface\" at radius r. In general, the nested flux surfaces\nare neither circular nor concentric; however, a concentric circular geometry, R0 = Rr for r \u2208 [0, a],\nis often used as a first approximation. The relationship between vector components in the tokamak\n\u02c6 k\u0302) may be succinctly expressed by\ncoordinates (\u1e90, R\u0302, \u03c6\u0302) \u2190 (r\u0302, \u03b8\u0302, \u03c6\u0302) \u2190 (r\u0302, \u22a5,\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\uf8ee\n\uf8f9 \uf8ee\n\uf8f9\nFr\nFZ\n\u2212 sin \u03b8 \u2212 cos \u03b8 0\n1 0\n0\n\uf8f0 FR \uf8fb = \uf8f0 cos \u03b8 \u2212 sin \u03b8 0 \uf8fb \uf8f0 0 b\u03c6 b\u03b8 \uf8fb \uf8f0 F\u22a5 \uf8fb ,\n(A.1)\n0\n0\n1\n0 \u2212b\u03b8 b\u03c6\nF\u03c6\nFk\nwhere k\u0302 \u2261 B/B \u2261 (0, b\u03b8 , b\u03c6 ). Various useful relationships are\nZ = \u2212r sin \u03b8 ,\n\u2202Z/\u2202r = Z/r , \u2202Z/\u2202\u03b8 = \u2212(R \u2212 R0 ) ,\nR \u2212 R0 = r cos \u03b8 , \u2202R/\u2202\u03b8 = Z ,\n\u2202R/\u2202r = (R \u2212 R0 )/r ,\n\n275\n276\n277\n\n(A.2)\n\nand for the logarithm, we have \u2202 ln R/\u2202R = 1/R where the units on the left are carried by the\ndifferential operator and the units on the right are carried by the result, which shows that the ln R\nis a pure number which carries no units.\nReferences\nAbramowitz, M., Stegun, I.
