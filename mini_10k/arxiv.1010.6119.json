compactifications, Springer fibers.\nMSC-2010: 15B10, 05E18, 22E46\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nLet G denote the special linear group SLn over C, the field of complex numbers. Let U \u2282 G\ndenote the set of all unipotent elements, which forms an irreducible, closed subvariety of G.\nConsider the incidence variety X = {(gB, x) \u2208 G/B \u00d7 G : g \u22121 xg \u2208 U}. It is well known\nthat U is singular; however, the second projection pr2 : X \u2192 G is a resolution of singularities\n1\n\n\ffor U (see [17] and [21]). The fibers of pr2 , known as Springer fibers, have many remarkable\ncombinatorial and geometric properties. For example, if u \u2208 G is a unipotent element, then\nfor each i \u2265 0 the cohomology space H i (pr2\u22121 (u), Q) is a representation of the symmetric\ngroup Sn , and the top non-vanishing cohomology space is an irreducible Sn -module ([18],\n[19]). Furthermore, all irreducible components of pr2\u22121 (u) have the same dimension e(u),\nwhich is equal to the half of the dimension of the top non-vanishing cohomology space\nH 2e(u) (pr \u22121 (u), Q), [16]. These facts lead to striking combinatorial results as in [9, 12, 22].\nMotivated by the combinatorial significance of the fibers of pr2 , in our earlier paper [2]\nwe initiated a study of the sets\n(G/K)u = {gK : g \u22121 ug \u2208 K},\n\n(1.1)\n\nwhen K = SOn , the special orthogonal group, and when K = Spn , the symplectic group.\nHere u \u2208 G is a prescribed unipotent element. Unlike the fibers pr2\u22121 (u), our sets (G/K)u are\nnot complete. Therefore, in this paper we continue our analysis by studying their completions\nin a compactification of G/K.\nSuppose there exists an involution \u03b8 : G \u2192 G such that K = {g \u2208 G : \u03b8(g) = g} is the\nfixed subgroup of \u03b8. Let H = NG (K) denote the normalizer of K in G; in the two examples\nabove, H = Z(SLn )K, where Z(SLn ) denotes the center of SLn . The wonderful embedding\nof G/H is the unique smooth projective G-variety M = MG/H that contains a copy of\nG/H as a G-stable open subset, and its boundary M \u2212 G/H is a finite union of G-stable\ndivisors with normal crossings [4]. The case where G = G1 \u00d7 G1 , with G1 reductive and\n\u03b8(x, y) = (y, x), so that K = diag(G1 ) and G/K \u223c\n= G1 , has been studied previously. In fact,\nthe wonderful embedding in this case is used in the study of character sheaves by Lusztig\n[13] and by Lusztig-He [7]. The Zariski closures in the wonderful compactifications of some\nclosely related subvarieties of G1 (called \"Steinberg fibers\") are studied by He [6] and by\nHe-Thomsen [8]. For a survey of these results, we recommend Springer's I.C.M. report [20].\nOur main focus is on the fixed locus of a regular unipotent element u. (Here, regular\nmeans that the Jordan type of u consists of a single block.) Let X denote the wonderful\ncompactification MG/H as described above corresponding to K = SOn or K = Spn . We\n2\n\n\fconstruct a cell decomposition of the variety X u consisting of complete quadrics (respectively,\ncomplete skew forms) that are invariant under u. As an application, we compute the Poincar\u00e9\npolynomial (i.e. the generating function for the dimensions of the cohomology with Qcoefficients) of the variety X u in each of these cases. The Poincar\u00e9 polynomial corresponding\n\u0001 i\nP\nx , and the Poincar\u00e9 polynomial for Spn is (1 + x)n/2\u22121 . (In fact, the\nto SOn is ni=0 n\u22121\u2212i\ni\nfirst Poincar\u00e9 polynomial is a polynomial analog of the (n \u2212 1)-st Fibonacci number.)\n\nOur paper is organized as follows. After giving some notational conventions in the next\nsection, in Section 3.1 we review some results from [2] that explicitly describe which matrices\nare invariant under the action u * A = (u\u22121)\u22a4 Au\u22121 of a unipotent matrix u. In Section 3.2 we\nintroduce one parameter subgroups that we use in the cell decompositions of Section 5, and\nin Section 3.3 we give a brief overview of the construction of the wonderful compactifcation,\nfocusing on the special cases of complete quadrics (Section 3.4) and complete skew forms\n(Section 3.5) in detail. In Section 4, we describe a certain decomposition of unipotent fixed\nelements of the varieties of complete quadrics and of complete skew forms that we prove in\nSection 5 give a Bialynicki-Birula cell decomposition. Finally, we prove the assertions made\nabove about the Poincar\u00e9 polynomials.\n\nAcknowledgements The first author is partially supported by the Louisiana Board of\nRegents enhancement grant.\n\n2\n\nNotation\n\nWe use N to denote non-negative integers, and if n \u2208 N is non-zero, then we denote by [n]\nthe set {1, 2, . . . , n}. All varieties and spaces in this manuscript are defined over C and are\n\n3\n\n\fnot necessarily irreducible. Our basic list of notation is as follows:\nspace of n \u00d7 n matrices\n\nMatn :\nSLn \u2282 Matn :\n\ninvertible matrices with determinant 1\nspace of n \u00d7 n symmetric matrices\n\nSymn :\nSym0n \u2282 Symn :\n\ninvertible symmetric matrices\nspace of n \u00d7 n skew-symmetric matrices\n\nSkewn :\nSkew0n \u2282 Skewn :\n\ninvertible skew-symmetric matrices\n\nL\nNote that Matn \u223c\n= Symn Skewn .\n\nThere is a common left action of SLn on the spaces Matn , Symn and Skewn given by\ng * A = (g \u22121 )T Ag \u22121 .\n\n(2.1)\n\nIt follows from Cholesky's decompositions that on Sym0n and Skew0n the action (2.1) of SLn\nis transitive (see Appendix B of [5]). It is easy to check that the stabilizer of the identity\nmatrix In \u2208 Sym0n is the special orthogonal group SOn := {A \u2208 SLn : AA\u22a4 = In }, and the\nstabilizer of\nJ=\n\n0\n\nIn\n\n\u2212In\n\n0\n\n!\n\n\u2208 Skew02n\n\nis the symplectic subgroup Sp2n \u2282 SL2n . Therefore, the quotients SLn /SO2n and SL2n /Sp2n\nare canonically identified with the quasi-affine varieties Sym0n and Skew02n , respectively.\nA composition of n is an ordered sequence positive integers that sum to n. For example,\n(1, 3, 2, 4, 2) is a composition of 12. We denote by Comp(n) the set of all compositions of n.\nA partition of n is an unordered sequence of integers that sum to n. Since it is unordered,\nwithout loss of generality we assume that the entries of a partition form a non-increasing\nsequence. Let \u03bb = (\u03bb1 , \u03bb2 , . . . , \u03bbk ) be a partition of n with \u03bbk \u2265 1. In this case, we call k\nthe length of \u03bb, and denote it by l(\u03bb). Entries \u03bbi , i = 1, . . . , k are called the parts of \u03bb.\nAlternatively, we write \u03bb = (1\u03b11 , 2\u03b12 , . . . , l\u03b1l ) to indicate that \u03bb consists of \u03b11 1's, \u03b12 2's,\nand so on. Zero parts or terms with zero exponent may be added and removed without\n4\n\n\faltering \u03bb. For example, each of (3, 3, 2), (3, 3, 2, 0), (10 , 21 , 32 ), and (21 , 32 ) represent the\nsame partition 3 + 3 + 2 of 8. As a special case used frequently in this paper, the notation\n(k) indicates the partition with single part equal to k.\nFinally, for an arbitrary matrix B = (bij )ni,j=1 , we say that bij lies on the k-th anti-diagonal\nif i + j = n + k. The first anti-diagonal of B is the main anti-diagonal.\n\n3\n\nPreliminaries\n\n3.1\n\nUnipotent invariant matrices\n\nWe recall some basic structural results on unipotent fixed matrices from [2].\nLet N be a nilpotent matrix with entries in C, u = exp N. There is an elementary but\nefficient criterion for determining when a matrix is fixed by u:\nu * A = A \u21d0\u21d2 AN + N T A = 0.\n\n(3.1)\n\nIt is easy to see that the Jordan type of u = exp(N) is the same as the Jordan type of\nN. Let N and N \u2032 be two nilpotent matrices that are conjugate in SLn , say N \u2032 = SNS \u22121 . If\nwe set u = exp(N) and u\u2032 = exp(N \u2032 ), then the fixed point loci of u and u\u2032 are isomorphic\nvia A 7\u2192 SAS T . It follows that the fixed point space X u depends only on the Jordan type\nof u, or equivalently only on the Jordan type of N.\nIt is well known that the Jordan classes of n-by-n nilpotent matrices are in bijection with\npartitions of n. Indeed, let N(p) be the p-by-p matrix\n\uf8eb\n0 1 0 ***\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec0 0 1 * * *\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec. . . .\nN(p) = \uf8ec\n\uf8ec .. .. .. . .\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec0 0 0 * * *\n\uf8ed\n0 0 0 ***\n5\n\n0 0\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n0\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n.. \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n.\uf8f7 .\n\uf8f7\n0 1\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n0 0\n0\n..\n.\n\n(3.2)\n\n\fThen the above correspondence associates to a partition \u03bb = (\u03bb1 , \u03bb2 , . . . , \u03bbk ), to the Jordan\nmatrix N\u03bb given in block form by\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nN\u03bb1 0 * * *\n0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec 0 N\u03bb2 * * *\n0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n.\nN\u03bb = \uf8ec .\n..\n.. \uf8f7\n..\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec ..\n.\n.\n.\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n0\n0 * * * N\u03bbk\n\nFrom now on if the Jordan type of u is \u03bb, we write X \u03bb in place of X u .\nIt is straightforward to verify that a generic element A = (ai,j )ni,j=1 of Mat(n)\nhas the\nn\nfollowing form:\n\uf8eb\n0\n0\n0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n0\n0\n0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n0\n0\n0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n..\n..\n..\n\uf8ec\n.\n.\n.\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n0\n0\n(\u22121)n\u22123 a1,n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n0\n(\u22121)n\u22122 a1,n (\u22121)n\u22123 a2,n\n\uf8ed\n(\u22121)n\u22121 a1,n (\u22121)n\u22122 a2,n (\u22121)n\u22123 a3,n\n\n***\n\n0\n\n0\n\n***\n\n0\n\n\u2212a1,n\n\n***\n.\n..\n\na1,n\n..\n.\n\n\u2212a2,n\n..\n.\n\n* * * an\u22124,n \u2212an\u22123,n\n* * * an\u22123,n \u2212an\u22122,n\n* * * an\u22122,n \u2212an\u22121,n\n\na1,n\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\na2,n \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\na3,n \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n.. \uf8f7\n. \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\nan\u22122,n \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\nan\u22121,n \uf8f7\n\uf8f8\nan,n\n\n(3.3)\n\nAn analysis of the matrices of the form (3.3) yields the following propositions.\n\nProposition 3.4.

Let N be an arbitrary nilpotent matrix with entries in C, u = exp N, and\nU = {exp(tN) : t \u2208 C}. If X is any complete variety on which U acts, then X u = X U .\n\n3.3\n\nEmbeddings\n\nLet G denote SLn , B \u2282 G the subgroup of upper triangular matrices and let T \u2282 B be\nthe subgroup of diagonal matrices. A closed subgroup P of G is called a standard parabolic\nsubgroup, if B \u2286 P . More generally, a subgroup P \u2032 is called parabolic, if there exists g \u2208 G\nsuch that P \u2032 = gP g \u22121 for some standard parabolic subgroup P \u2282 G.\nThere exists a one-to-one correspondence between the standard parabolic subgroups of\nG and the subsets of [n \u2212 1] given by:\nI\n\nPI := BWI B,\n7\n\n\fwhere WI is the subgroup of the symmetric group Sn generated by the simple transpositions\nsi = (i, i + 1) for i \u2208 I. With this notation, the quotient space G/PI is called the partial flag\nvariety of type I. We need the following interpretation of G/PI .\nLet I c = {j1 , . . . , js } be the complement of I in [n \u2212 1]. Then G/PI is identified with the\nset of all nested sequences of vector spaces (flags) of the form\nF : 0 \u2282 V j 1 \u2282 V j 2 \u2282 * * * \u2282 V j s \u2282 Cn ,\nwhere dim Vjk = jk , k = 1, . . . , s. The type of a flag F is defined to be the set {j1 , . . . , js },\nor equivalently, it is the composition (j1 , j2 \u2212 j1 , . . . , js \u2212 js\u22121 , n \u2212 js ) of n.\nFinally, let us mention the fact that G/PI has a canonical decomposition into B-orbits\nwhere the orbits are indexed by the elements of W I , the minimal length coset representatives.\nFurthermore, T acts on G/PI and each B-orbit contains a unique T -fixed flag. For more\ndetails, see [10].\nWe briefly review the theory of wonderful embeddings, referring the reader to [4] for more\ndetails.\nFor us, a symmetric space is a quotient of the form G/K, where G is an algebraic group\nand K is the normalizer of the fixed subgroup of an automorphism \u03c3 : G \u2192 G of order\n2. When G is a semi-simple simply connected algebraic group (over an algebraically closed\nfield), there exists a unique minimal smooth projective G-variety X = XG/K , called the\nwonderful embedding of G/K, such that\n1. X contains an open G-orbit X0 isomorphic to G/K;\n2. X \u2212 X0 is the union of finitely many G-stable smooth codimension one subvarieties Xi\nfor i = 1, 2, . . . , r;\n3. for any I \u2282 [r], the intersection X I :=\n\nT\n\ni\u2208I\n/\n\nXi is smooth and transverse;\n\n4. every irreducible G-stable subvariety has the form X I for some I \u2282 [r];\n\n8\n\n\f5. for I \u2282 [r], let O I denote the dense G-orbit in X I . There is a fundamental decomposition\nXI =\n\nG\n\nOK.\n\n(3.7)\n\nK\u2282I\n\nConsequently, G-orbit closures form a Boolean lattice and there exists a unique closed\norbit Z corresponding to I = \u2205.\nThe recursive structure of wonderful embeddings is apparent from the following observation:\nFor each I \u2282 [r], there exists a parabolic subgroup PI and G-equivariant fibrations\n\u03c0 : O I \u2192 G/PI and \u03c0I : X I \u2192 G/PI such that the following diagram commutes:\nOI\n\nXI\n\u03c0I\n\n\u03c0I\nG/PI\n\nIt turns out that the fiber of \u03c0 is L/N, where L is the semi-simple part of the Levi subgroup\nof PI and N is the normalizer in L of the fixed subgroup of \u03b8 induced on L. Moreover, the\nfiber (\u03c0 I )\u22121 (x) over a point x \u2208 G/PI is isomorphic to a wonderful embedding of \u03c0I\u22121 (x).\nThere is more to be said about the parametrizing set [r] of the G-orbits. We choose a\nmaximal torus S consisting of semi-simple elements x \u2208 G such that \u03b8(x) = x\u22121 . Let T\nbe a maximal torus containing S. Then T is automatically \u03b8-stable. Denote by \u03a6 the root\nsystem for T in G. Then \u03b8 induces an involution on \u03a6, which we denote by \u03b8, also. Let\n\u03a60 \u2286 \u03a6 denote the set of roots that are fixed by \u03b8, and let \u03a61 denote the complementary set\nof moved roots. We choose a Borel subgroup B containing T such that the corresponding\nset of positive roots \u03a6+ satisfy \u03b8(\u03a6+ \u2229 \u03a61 ) \u2286 \u2212\u03a6+ .\nThere is a natural restriction map res : X \u2217 (T ) \u2192 X \u2217 (S) and the image of \u03a61 gives a not\nnecessarily reduced root system in X \u2217 (S) \u2297Z R. Let \u2206 denote the set of simple roots of \u03a6+\nand set \u22061 = \u2206 \u2229 \u03a61 . We call the image \u2206 = res(\u22061 ), the set of simple restricted roots.\n\n9\n\n\fFinally, let \u03a0 denote the set of fixed simple roots \u03a60 \u2229 \u2206. We denote by P\u03a0 the corresponding parabolic subgroup of G. The unique closed orbit is isomorphic to G/P\u03a0 .\n\n3.4\n\nExample: Complete Quadrics\n\nThere is a vast literature on the variety of complete quadrics. See [11] for a survey. We\nbriefly recall the necessary definitions.\nTwo non-degenerate n\u00d7n symmetric matrices represent the same non-degenerate quadric\nhypersurface in Pn\u22121 if and only if they differ by multiplication by a scalar; hence P(Symn )\nis the moduli of such quadric hypersurfaces. In this context, the classical definition of the\nvariety of complete quadrics in Pn\u22121 (see [14, 15, 23]) is as the closure of the image of the\nmap\n1\n\n2\n\n[A] 7\u2192 ([\u039b (A)], [\u039b (A)], . . . , [\u039b\n\nn\u22121\n\n(A)]) \u2208\n\nn\u22121\nY\n\nP(\u039bi (Symn )), [A] \u2208 P(Sym0n ).\n\n(3.8)\n\ni=1\n\nIn more modern group-theoretical language, the variety of complete quadrics is the wonderful\nembedding MQ = MSLn /Z(SLn )SOn of the symmetric space SLn /Z(SLn )SOn .\nLet I \u2286 [n \u2212 1] and let PI be the corresponding standard parabolic subgroup. It follows\nfrom results of Vainsencher [24] that a point P \u2208 MQ is described by the data of a flag\nF : V0 = 0 \u2282 V1 \u2282 * * * \u2282 Vs\u22121 \u2282 Vs = Cn\n\n(3.9)\n\nand a collection Q = (Q1 , . . . Qs ) of quadrics Qi \u2286 P(Vi ) whose singular locus is P(Vi\u22121 ).\nMoreover, OI consists of complete quadrics whose flag F is of type I and the map (F , Q) 7\u2192\nF is the SLn -equivariant projection\n\u03c0 I : MIQ \u2192 SLn /PI .\n\n(3.10)\n\nThe fiber of \u03c0 I over F \u2208 SLn /PI is isomorphic to a product of varieties of complete quadrics\nof smaller dimension.\nLet \u03b8o : SLn \u2192 SLn denote the automorphism \u03b8o (g) = (g \u22121)\u22a4 . Then \u03b8o is an involution\nand its fixed subgroup is precisely H = SOn . In this case, the set of moved roots and the set\n10\n\n\fof simple roots \u2206 of T coincide. Here T is the maximal torus of diagonal matrices in SLn .\nThe unique closed orbit, therefore, corresponds to the empty set of roots, and hence, it is\nisomorphic to the flag variety G/B.\nFurthermore, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the subsets of \u22061 = \u2206 and\nthe G-orbits. It follows for each standard parabolic subgroup PI \u2286 G, I \u2282 \u2206, there exists\nG-equivariant fibration \u03c0 : O I \u2192 G/PI with fibers isomorphic to LI /NI , where LI is the\nsemi-simple part of the Levi subgroup of PI and NI is the normalizer in LI of the fixed\nsubgroup of \u03b8 induced on LI .\nOn the other hand, we know that the standard Levi subgroups in G = SLn are of the\nQ\nP\nform kj=1 SLmj , where\nmj = n. Since the \u03b8-fixed subgroup of such a group is isomorphic\nQ\nQk\nto j=1 SOmj , a fiber of \u03c0 has to form kj=1 Sym0mj .\n\n3.5\n\nExample: Complete Skew Forms\n\nNotation: From now on, n is assumed to be an even number whenever we deal with a\nsymplectic group.\nThe classical construction of the wonderful compactification of SLn /Z(SLn )Spn , MS =\nMSLn /Z(SLn )Spn , is similar to that of MQ ; instead of symmetric matrices in (3.8) one needs\nto use 2-forms (n \u00d7 n skew-symmetric matrices).\nThe group-theoretical definition parallels that of MQ as well. A point P \u2208 MS is given\nby the data of a flag of even dimensional subspaces\nF : V0 = 0 \u2282 V1 \u2282 * * * \u2282 Vs\u22121 \u2282 Vs = Cn\n\n(3.11)\n\nand a collection W = (\u03c91 , . . . \u03c9s ) of 2-forms, where \u03c9i is a 2-form in P(Vi ) whose null space\nis P(Vi\u22121 ). Moreover, O I consists of complete 2-forms whose flag F is of type I and the map\n(F , W) 7\u2192 F is the SLn -equivariant projection\n\u03c0 I : MIS \u2192 SLn /PI .\n\n(3.12)\n\nThe fiber of \u03c0 I over F \u2208 SLn /PI is isomorphic to a product of wonderful compactifications\nof spaces of complete skew forms of smaller dimension.\n11\n\n\f4\n\nFixed Subvarieties\n\nIn this section we describe the fixed subvarieties of a regular unipotent element operating on\ncomplete quadrics and complete skew forms.\nDefinition 4.1. Let\nF : 0 = V0 \u2282 V1 \u2282 V2 \u2282 * * * \u2282 Vk = V\nbe a (partial) flag of V = Cn . For any g \u2208 SLn , the flag F is g-fixed if and only if g(Vi ) = Vi\nfor all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k. For any n \u00d7 n matrix M, the flag F is M-stable if and only if M(Vi ) \u2286 Vi\u22121\nfor all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k.\nRemark 4.2. Let N be a nilpotent n\u00d7n matrix and u = exp(N) the corresponding unipotent\nelement of SLn . Then a flag F of Cn is u-fixed if and only if it is N-stable.\nLemma 4.3. Let V = Cn with standard basis\n\uf8eb\n0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec0\n\uf8ec\nN = N(n) = \uf8ec .\n\uf8ec ..\n\uf8ed\n\n{e1 , e2 , . . . , en }, and let\n\uf8f6\n1 0 *** 0\n\uf8f7\n0 1 * * * 0\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n.. .. . . .. \uf8f7\n. .\uf8f7\n. .\n\uf8f8\n0 0 0 *** 0\n\nbe the regular nilpotent operator for this basis. Set u = exp(N). Then for each composition\n\u03b3 of n, there is a unique flag of type \u03b3 that is fixed by u, namely the sub-flag of type \u03b3 of the\nstandard complete flag 0 \u2282 Ce1 \u2282 Ce1 \u2295 Ce2 \u2282 * * * \u2282 Ce1 \u2295 Ce2 \u2295 * * * \u2295 Cen = V .\nProof. We prove this by induction on the number k of parts of the composition \u03b3. Let v be\nany non-zero vector in V1 and let j be the largest integer such that v contains a non-zero\nej component. Then v, N(v), N 2 (v), . . . , N j\u22121 (v) are j linearly independent vectors in V1 .\nSince dim(V1 ) = \u03b31 , this implies j \u2264 \u03b31 . Thus V1 = Ce1 \u2295 Ce2 \u2295 * * * \u2295 Ce\u03b31 . Now apply the\ninductive hypothesis to the induced flag obtained by quotienting F by V1 , noting that the\ninduced nilpotent transformation on V /V1 has Jordan type (n \u2212 \u03b31 ), allowing the induction\nto proceed.\n12\n\n\fRemark 4.4. Let u = exp(N) be as in Lemma 4.3, and let F : 0 \u2282 V1 \u2282 V2 \u2282 * * * \u2282 Vk = Cn\nbe an N-stable flag (or, equivalently, u-fixed) of type \u03b3 = (\u03b31 , . . . , \u03b3k ). Then restriction of\nN to Vi /Vi\u22121 is another principal nilpotent operator and its Jordan type is (\u03b3i ). It follows\nfrom Section 3.1 that, if dim(Vi /Vi\u22121 ) is even for some 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k, then there are no u-fixed\nquadrics in P(Vi /Vi\u22121 ). Consequently, there cannot be any u-fixed complete quadrics on such\na flag F . On the other hand, if dim(Vi /Vi\u22121 ) is odd for some 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k, then there are no\nu-fixed 2-forms in P(Vi /Vi\u22121 ), hence no u-fixed complete skew-forms on such a flag.\nWe are ready to give a set theoretic description of the u-fixed subvarieties of our compactifications.\n(n)\n\nProposition 4.5. The unipotent fixed subvariety MQ has a decomposition into affine spaces\nindexed by the compositions of n with no even parts. Similarly, the unipotent fixed subvariety\n(n)\n\nMS\n\nhas a decomposition into affine spaces indexed by the compositions of n with no odd\n\nparts.\n(n)\n\n(n)\n\nProof. We begin with the case MQ . Let (F , Q) be a point of MQ with F of type \u03b3 =\n(\u03b31 , . . . , \u03b3k ). Then by Remark 4.4 we know that each \u03b3i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 k) is odd. It follows from\nProposition 3.4 (1) that the space of non-degenerate u-fixed quadrics on P(Vi /Vi\u22121 ) is an\naffine space of dimension (\u03b3i \u2212 1)/2.\n(n),\u03b3\n\nLet MQ\n\n(n)\n\n\u2286 MQ denote the subspace consisting of complete quadrics of flag type \u03b3.\n\nClearly,\n(n)\n\nMQ =\n\nG\n\n(n),\u03b3\n\nMQ\n\n,\n\n\u03b3\n\nwhere the union is over all compositions \u03b3 = (\u03b31, . . . , \u03b3k ) of n with odd parts only. Moreover,\n(n),\u03b3\n\nthe above discussion implies that MQ\n(n),\u03b3\n\nMQ\n\nis an affine space:\n\n= A(\u03b31 \u22121)/2 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 A(\u03b3k \u22121)/2 \u223c\n= A(n\u2212k)/2 .\n\n(n)\n\nThe argument for MS is similar, so we write the end result:\n(n)\n\nMS =\n\nG\n\u03b2\n\n13\n\n(n),\u03b2\n\nMS\n\n,\n\n\fwhere the union is over all compositions \u03b2 = (\u03b21 , . . . , \u03b2k ) of n with even parts only, and each\n(n),\u03b2\n\nMS\n\nis an affine space:\n(n),\u03b2\n\nMS\n\n= A\u03b21 /2\u22121 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 A\u03b2k /2\u22121 \u223c\n= An/2\u2212k .\n\nAs an immediate corollary of the proof of Proposition 4.5 we have\n(n)\n\n(n)\n\nCorollary 4.6. dim MQ = \u230a(n \u2212 1)/2\u230b, and dim MS = n/2 \u2212 1.\n\n5\n\nCell Decompositions\n\n5.1\n\nC\u2217 action on matrices\n\nLet T \u2282 SLn denote the maximal torus of diagonal matrices.

We briefly recall certain\naspects of this well developed theory of torus actions.\nTheorem 5.5. [1, Theorem 4.3] Let Z be a smooth, irreducible projective variety with a\nC\u2217 -action such that the fixed point set is finite. Then\n\u2217\n\n1. For each fixed point x \u2208 Z C , the set\nCx := {y \u2208 Z : lim t * y = x}\nt\u21920\n\nis an affine space.\n2. The closures Cx of the cells Cx form an additive basis for the Chow ring (as well as\nthe integral cohomology ring) of Z.\nIt turns out that the smoothness condition in the above theorem can be relaxed.\nTheorem 5.6. [3, Theorem 1] Let Z be a possibly singular, possibly reducible C\u2217 -variety\nwhose fixed point set is finite. If the first statement in Theorem 5.5 holds, then so does the\nsecond statement.\nIf the first statement of Theorem 5.5 holds (hence the conclusion of Theorem 5.6 holds),\nF\nthen we call the decomposition Z = x\u2208Z C\u2217 Cx a cell decomposition of Z with respect to the\n\u2217\n\nC\u2217 -action, and refer to the affine sets Cx , x \u2208 Z C , as the cells of the decomposition.\n16\n\n\f5.3\n\nTorus action on compactifications\n\nWe consider extensions of the action given by \u03c6n (defined in Section 3.2) on matrices to MQ\nand to MS . Recall from the proof of Proposition 4.5 that there are decompositions\nG (n),\u03b3\nG (n),\u03b2\n(n)\n(n)\nMQ =\nMQ\nand MS =\nMS ,\n\u03b3\n\n(n),\u03b3\n\nwhere MQ\n\n(5.7)\n\n\u03b2\n\nis the affine space consisting of unipotent invariant complete quadrics of flag\n(n),\u03b2\n\ntype \u03b3, and MS\n\nis the affine space consisting of unipotent invariant complete skew-forms\n\nof flag type \u03b2.\nTheorem 5.8. Let \u03c6n be the 1-PSG defined in Section 3.2. Then C\u2217 acts on the spaces\n(n)\n\n(n)\n\nMQ and MS\n\nwith finitely many fixed points. The cells of the torus action are given by\n\nthe decompositions (5.7).\nProof. Let e1 , . . . , en denote the standard ordered basis for Cn , and let Fs denote the standard\nflag 0 \u2282 V1 \u2282 V2 \u2282 * * * \u2282 Vn = Cn , where Vr is the C-span of e1 , . . . , er . Let x = (F , P) be\n(n)\n\n(n)\n\neither from MQ or from MS . By Lemma 4.3, we know that in order for x to be fixed by\nu = exp N(n) its flag F has to be a subflag of Fs . Suppose F : 0 \u2282 Vj1 \u2282 * * * \u2282 Vjk = Cn ,\nand suppose P = (P1 , . . . , Pk ) is the (symmetric or skew) form of x. Then the i-th entry of\nP is a non-degenerate form (up to a scaler multiple) on the quotient space Vji /Vji\u22121 , and\nfurthermore, it is fixed by the restriction of u on Vji /Vji \u22121 , which is a regular unipotent\noperator of Jordan type (dim Vji \u2212 dim Vji\u22121 ).\nIt is straightforward to verify that \u03c6n (C\u2217 ) * F = F . Therefore, it remains showing that\nthere are only finitely many P on F such that \u03c6(C\u2217 ) * P = P. Note that this equality\nis true if and only if the restriction of \u03c6n (C\u2217 ) to each quotient space Vji /Vji\u22121 acts on the\ncorresponding form Pi trivially. But we know from Lemma 5.4 that Pi has to be represented\nby an anti-diagonal matrix of size dim Vji \u2212 dim Vji\u22121 . In either case, our conclusion is that\nthere is only one C\u2217 -fixed point for each subflag F of the standard flag Fs . Since C\u2217 -action\n(n),\u03b3\n\npreserves the flag type, and since the affine subsets MQ\n\n(n),\u03b2\n\n, MS\n\nfrom (5.7) are precisely\n\nthe unipotent invariant complete forms of a given flag type, by Theorem 5.6 we see that the\naffine subsets of (5.7) must be the cells of the C\u2217 -action.\n17\n\n\fLet Compo (n) denote the set of all compositions of n with odd parts only, and let\nCompe (n) denote the set of all compositions of n with even parts only.\n(n)\n\nCorollary 5.9. The Poincar\u00e9 polynomial PM(n) (x) of MQ is given by\nQ\n\nX\n\nPM(n) (x) =\nQ\n\n(n\u2212k)/2\n\nx\n\n(\u03b31 ,...,\u03b3k )\u2208Compo (n)\n\n\u0013\nn \u0012\nX\nn\u22121\u2212i i\nx.\n=\ni\ni=0\n\nProof. For simplicity let pn (x) denote the Poincar\u00e9 polynomial PM(n) (x). The first equality\nQ\n\nfollows from the proof of Proposition 4.5. To prove the second equality, we first find a\nrecurrence for pn (x). To this end, observe that Compo (n) = Compo (n)\u2032 \u2294 Compo (n)\u2032\u2032 , where\nCompo (n)\u2032 consists of elements \u03b3 \u2208 Compo (n) such that \u03b31 = 1, and Compo (n)\u2032\u2032 consists of\nthose \u03c1 \u2208 Compo (n) with \u03c11 > 1.\nX\n\npn (x) =\n\nx(n\u2212k)/2 +\n\n\u03b3=(\u03b31 ,...,\u03b3k )\u2208Compo (n)\u2032\u2032\n\n=\n\nX\n\nX\n\nx(n\u2212l)/2\n\n\u03c1=(\u03c11 ...,\u03c1l )\u2208Compo (n)\u2032\u2032\n\nx[(n\u22121)\u2212(k\u22121)]/2 +\n\n(\u03b32 ,...,\u03b3k )\u2208Compo (n\u22121)\n\nX\n\nx * x[(n\u22122)\u2212l]/2 ,\n\n(\u03c11 \u22122...,\u03c1l )\u2208Compo (n\u22122)\n\nwhich simplifies to\npn (x) = pn\u22121 (x) + xpn\u22122 (x).\n\n(5.10)\n\nIt is easy to easy to check that p1 (x) = p2 (x) = 1. Now, a simple induction argument\ncombined with the well known recurrence\n\u0013\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0012\nn\u22122\u2212i\nn\u22122\u2212i\nn\u22121\u2212i\n+\n=\ni\ni\u22121\ni\ntogether with (5.10) give us the desired second equality.\n\nRemark 5.11. It follows from (5.10) and the initial conditions that the value at x = 1 of the\nPoincar\u00e9 polynomial PM(n) (x) is the (n \u2212 1)-st Fibonacci number.\nQ\n\n18\n\n\f(n)\n\nCorollary 5.12. Suppose n = 2m. Then the Poincar\u00e9 polynomial PM(n) (x) of MS is given\nS\n\nby\nX\n\nPM(n) (x) =\nS\n\nxn/2\u2212k = (1 + x)m\u22121 .\n\n(\u03b21 ,...,\u03b2k )\u2208Compe (n)\n\nProof. The first equality follows from the proof of Proposition 4.5. To prove the second\nequality observe that Compe (n) is in bijection with Comp(m), the set of all compositions of\nm. Thus, the equality\nX\n\nPM(n) (x) =\nS\n\nxm\u2212k\n\n(5.13)\n\n(\u03b21 ,...,\u03b2k )\u2208Comp(m)\n\nis obvious.\nRecall the bijection between the set of all compositions of m and the set of all subsets\nof [m \u2212 1]: For \u03b3 = (\u03b31 , . . . , \u03b3k ) a composition of m, let I\u03b3 denote the complement of the\nset I = {\u03b31 , \u03b31 + \u03b32 , . . . , \u03b31 + * * * + \u03b3k\u22121 } in [m \u2212 1]. Then the assignment \u03b3 7\u2192 I\u03b3 is the\ndesired bijection between compositions of m with k parts and the subsets of [m \u2212 1] with\nm \u2212 1 \u2212 (k \u2212 1) = m \u2212 k elements. Therefore, the right hand side of equation (5.13) is equal\nP\nto I\u2286[m\u22121] x|I| , which is obviously equal to (1 + x)m\u22121 .\n\nReferences\n[1] A. Bialynicki-Birula.
