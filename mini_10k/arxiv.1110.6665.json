We here correct their erroneous implication that \u03c3\u03bdN (s) should satisfy the\n\u03bdN\nFroissart bound and their mistaken assertion that we state that \u03c3BBT\nsatisfies it.\n\nThere is long-standing interest in the behavior of the ultrahigh energy (UHE) neutrino-nucleon\ntotal cross section, \u03c3\u03bdN (s), where s \u2261 (p\u03bd + pN )2 = 2mE\u03bd + m2 \u2248 2mE\u03bd is the four-momentum\nsquared of the neutrino-isobaric nucleon system, where m is the proton mass and N the isobaric\nnucleon. The authors of a recent Physical Review Letters paper, \"Ultrahigh-Energy NeutrinoNucleon Deep-Inelastic Scattering and the Froissart Bound\", [1], derive an approximate formula for\nthe UHE limit of \u03c3\u03bdN (s) in a class of models that includes our own and assert that they are led \"to\n\u03bdN\nthe important observation that \u03c3BBT\n\u221d ln3 s, which manifestly violates the Froissart bound [2] in\ncontrast to what is stated in Refs. [6-8]\", with their Ref. [8] being our work-see our Ref. [5]-and\n\u03bdN\nthe \u03c3BBT\nbeing the cross sections [3, 4] we reported in Ref. [5].\nTheir above-quoted implication that \u03c3\u03bdN (s) should satisfy the Froissart bound and their assertion about what is stated in our work are erroneous. In this commentary we cannot emphasize\ntoo strongly that we never implied, let alone stated, that our calculation of the weak cross section\n\u03c3\u03bdN (s) obeys the Froissart bound. It is simply not expected to satisfy \u03c3\u03bdN (s) \u2264 ln2 s [2]; it is a\nfirst order perturbation expansion in the electroweak coupling constant GF . What we do say is\nthat the Froissart bound may apply to \u03b3 \u2217 p, W \u2217\u00b1 N, Z0\u2217 N interactions [3, 4, 5], which we treat on\n\n1\n\n\fthe same footing as strong interactions. This is in the spirit of vector meson dominance, where the\nelectroweak currents communicate with hadronic systems through hadronic vector mesons [6].\nOur high quality fit to all of the small-x HERA I data [7] with a handful of parameters lends solid\nsupport to this hypothesis. In this case the deep inelastic scattering (DIS) reaction is e + p \u2192 e + X,\nand the role of the electron is to supply the virtual \u03b3 \u2217 which, via vector dominance, interacts strongly\nwith the proton. There is no reason to believe that \u03c3ep (s), a quantity calculated only to leading\norder in \u03b1, the electromagnetic coupling constant, is subjected to any bound. Similarly, there\nis no reason to expect that \u03c3\u03bdN (s), the neutrino-isobaric nucleon total cross section-a quantity\ncalculated in only leading order in electroweak interactions and all orders in strong interactions-is\nconstrained by the Froissart bound.\nTo make the distinction crystal clear between the interactions that might or might not be\nsubjected to the Froissart bound, let us define the appropriate squared center of mass energy\ns\u2217 = (q + pN )2 , where q the off-shell vector boson 4-momentum. This is the final state hadronic\ninvariant mass-squared (often denoted as W 2 in DIS literature); s\u2217 is the appropriate variable for the\n\u03b3 \u2217 p, W \u2217\u00b1 N, Z0\u2217 N total strong interaction scattering cross sections. We reiterate that the electron\nsimply furnishes the virtual photon \u03b3 \u2217 for DIS, whereas in the neutrino-nucleon interaction, the\nneutrino serves only to provide the W \u2217\u00b1 or the Z0\u2217 . Since for DIS, s\u2217 = Q2 (1 \u2212 x)/x + m2 \u2248 Q2 /x\nfor small Bjorken x and large, fixed virtuality Q2 = \u2212q 2 , saturating the Froissart bound of ln2 (s\u2217 )\nin \u03b3 \u2217 p scattering is equivalent to the statement that F2p (x, Q2 ) grows no faster than ln2 x. We\nemphasize that this is a statement only about the structure function F2p (x, Q2 ); it does not apply\nto the total ep cross section's dependence on s = (pe + pp )2 . Similarly, when the same proton\nstructure function is used for off-shell, weak vector boson-N scattering, no statement is made about\n\u03c3\u03bdN (s) satisfying a Froissart bound in s = (p\u03bd + pN )2 .\nThe purpose of this comment is to make clear that our work in [4, 5] does not require or even\nhint at the possibility that the \u03c3\u03bdp (s) cross section obeys the Froissart bound in s, using our\nmodel for F2 (Q2 , x). The Froissart bound in s\u2217 -used as a guide to the asymptotic behavior of\n\u03c3\u03b3\u2217N (s\u2217 ) \u223c F2 (Q2 , x)-was its only application in our work. Thus, we conclude that the \"master\nformula\" of Ref. [1], their Eq.(10), applicable to models of F2 (x, Q2 ) including our own and that\nexplicitly displays the models' asymptotic behaviors, cannot be used to determine whether or not\nF2 has the \"correct\" asymptotic behavior.\nM.
