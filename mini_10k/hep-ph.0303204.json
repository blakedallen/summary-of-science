Outstanding Phenomenological Questions in High Energy\nQCD\n1.1. Introduction\nThe advent of a new generation of high energy collider experiments,\nbeginning with HERA and the Tevatron in the early 1990's to RHIC\nand LHC in the new millenium (and others in the planning stages) have\nlaunched a new era in the study of the strong interactions. Questions\nwhich have been around since the early days of the strong interactions,\nsuch as the behavior of cross-sections at high energies, the universality\nof hadronic interactions at high energies, the nature of multi-particle\nproduction and the possibility of creating thermalized states of strongly\ninteracting matter have acquired fresh vigor. For instance, it is often\nbelieved that little could be learned about the high energy limit of QCD\nsince the physics is assumed to be entirely non-perturbative. On the\nother hand, we have learned from HERA that parton densities are large\nat high energies or equivalently, at small values of Bjorken x. The large\ndensities of small x, or \"wee\" partons suggest, as we will discuss at length\nlater, that semi-hard scales may be present which allow one to describe\nthe physics of this regime using weak coupling techniques. QCD at high\nenergies can thus be described as a many-body theory of partons which\nare weakly coupled albeit non-perturbative due to the large number of\npartons. We will call this system a Color Glass Condensate (CGC), for\nthe following reasons:\n\u2022 \"Color\", since the gluons are colored.\n\u2022 \"Glass\" because of the strong analogy of the system to actual glasses. A\nglass is a disordered system which evolves very slowly relative to natural\ntime scales: it is like a solid on short time scales and like a liquid on\nmuch longer time scales. Similarly, the partons of interest are disordered\nand evolve in longitudinal momentum in a manner analogous to a glass.\n\u2022 \"Condensate\" because it contains a very high density of massless gluons\nwhose momenta are peaked about some characteristic momentum. Increasing the energy forces the gluons to occupy higher momentum states\n(due to repulsive interactions) causing the coupling to become weaker.\nThe gluon density saturates at a value of order 1/\u03b1s \u226b 1, corresponding\nto a multiparticle Bose condensate state.\nWe will argue in the following that the Color Glass Condensate is\nthe effective theory describing high energy scattering in QCD. We will\noutline the rich structure of the theory and discuss how it provides insight into outstanding conceptual issues in QCD at asymptotically high\nenergies. The theory can be applied to study phenomena at a number\nof existing and upcoming high energy collider facilities. We will discuss\napplications of the CGC to study the initial conditions and equilibration in heavy ion collisions and to describe heavy ion phenomenology.\nWe will discuss applications to Deep Inelastic Scattering, to the current\nexperiments at HERA but also for future experiments being discussed\n\n3\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\n4\n\n21:22\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Review Volume\n\nQGP3 \u0307final \u0307web\n\nThe Color Glass Condensate and High Energy Scattering in QCD\n\nat HERA and at Brookhaven. In addition, we will discuss applications\nof the CGC to proton/deuteron-nucleus scattering experiments planned\nat RHIC and at the LHC and to peripheral nucleus-nucleus scattering\nexperiments at RHIC.\n1.2. Light cone kinematics and dynamics\nThe appropriate kinematics to discuss high energy scattering are lightcone (LC) coordinates. Let z be the longitudinal axis of the collision.\nFor an arbitrary 4-vector v \u03bc = (v 0 , v 1 , v 2 , v 3 ) (v 3 = vz , etc.), we define\nits LC coordinates as\n1\nv + \u2261 \u221a (v 0 + v 3 ),\n2\n\n1\nv \u2212 \u2261 \u221a (v 0 \u2212 v 3 ),\nv\u22a5 \u2261 (v 1 , v 2 ).\n(1.1)\n2\n\u221a\nIn particular, we\u221ashall refer to x+ = (t + z)/ 2 as the LC \"time\", and\n\u2212\nto x = (t \u2212 z)/ 2 as the LC \"longitudinal coordinate\". The invariant\nscalar product of two four-vectors reads:\np * x = p\u2212 x+ + p+ x\u2212 \u2212 p\u22a5 * x\u22a5 ,\n\n(1.2)\n+\n\n\u2212\n\nwhich suggests that p should be interpreted as the LC energy, and\n\u221a p as\nthe (LC) longitudinal momentum. In particular, since p\u00b1 = (1/ 2)(E \u00b1\npz ) with E = (m2 + p2 )1/2 , the light cone dispersion relation takes the\nform\np\u2212 =\n\n1 m2\u22a5\n1 p2\u22a5 + m2\n=\n,\n+\n2\np\n2 p+\n\n(1.3)\n\nwhere the transverse mass m\u22a5 is defined as m2\u22a5 = p2\u22a5 + m2 . The momentum space rapidity is further simply as:\ny \u2261\n\n1 p+\n1 2p+2\nln \u2212 = ln 2 .\n2 p\n2\nm\u22a5\n\n(1.4)\n\nThese definitions are useful, among other reasons, because of their simple properties under longitudinal Lorentz boosts: p+ \u2192 \u03bap+ , p\u2212 \u2192\n(1/\u03ba)p\u2212 , where \u03ba is a constant. Under boosts, the rapidity is just shifted\nby a constant: y \u2192 y + \u03ba.\nThe utility of light cone kinematics is not merely that of a convenient coordinate transformation. The Hamiltonian dynamics of quantum\nfield theories quantized on the light cone have several remarkable features as was first pointed out by Dirac 1 . Firstly, the LC Hamiltonian\np\u2212 (which is the generator of translations in the light cone time x+ ) can\n\u2212\nbe written in the form p\u2212 = p\u2212\n0 + V , where p0 is the free Hamiltonian,\ncorresponding to a complete set of non-interacting Fock eigenstates, and\nV is the light cone potential. Second, the LC vacuum is trivial, namely,\nthe vacuum state is an eigenstate of both the free and the full Hamiltonian. As a consequence of these properties, multi-parton Fock states\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\n21:22\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Review Volume\n\nQGP3 \u0307final \u0307web\n\nThe Color Glass Condensate and High Energy Scattering in QCD\n\ncan be constructed as eigenstates of the QCD Hamiltonian. Thus, in LC\nquantization (and in the light-cone gauge A+ = 0) the quark-parton\npicture of QCD becomes manifest. Finally, we note that the apparent\nnon-relativistic structure of the light cone Hamiltonian suggested by the\ndispersion relation in Eq. (1.3) is not accidental but is a consequence\nof an exact isomorphism between the Galilean subgroup of the Poincar\u00e9\ngroup and the symmetry group of two dimensional quantum mechanics 2 . Thus in LC quantization, the Rayleigh-Schr\u00f6dinger perturbation\ntheory with off-shell energy denominators can be used instead of the\nmore usual Feynman rules. For a more detailed discussion of the light\ncone formalism and its application to high energy scattering, we direct\nthe reader to Ref. 3 .\n1.3. High energy behavior of total cross-sections\nWe now return to the outstanding phenomenological questions we mentioned in the introduction. Clearly, computing total cross-sections as\nE \u2192 \u221e is one of the great unsolved problems of QCD. Unlike processes\nwhich are computed in perturbation theory, it is not required that any\nenergy transfer become large as the total collision energy E \u2192 \u221e. Computing a total cross-section for hadronic scattering therefore appears to\nbe an intrinsically non-perturbative procedure. In the 60's and early\n70's, Regge theory was extensively developed in an attempt to understand the total cross-section. The results of these analyses were, to our\nmind, inconclusive, and at any rate, certainly cannot be claimed to be\nunderstood from first principles in QCD.\nOn the basis of very general arguments invoking unitarity, analyticity\nand crossing, Froissart has shown that the total cross-section for the\nstrong interactions grows at most as fast as ln2 E as E \u2192 \u221e 4,5 . Several\nquestions arise in this regard. Is the coefficient of ln2 E universal for all\nhadronic processes? Can this coefficient be computed from first principles\nin QCD? How do we understand the saturation of the unitarity limit\ndynamically in QCD? Or is the Froissart bound an intrinsically nonperturbative phenomenon?\n1.4. Multi-particle production in QCD\nCan we compute N (E), the total multiplicity of produced particles as\na function of energy in QCD ? By this we mean not only the multiplicity of particles in jets (which is fairly well understood in perturbative\nQCD) but also the total number of particles, at least, for semi-hard\nmomenta. Consider the collision of two identical hadrons in the center\nof mass frame, as shown in Fig. 1. The colliding hadrons are ultrarelativistic and therefore Lorentz contracted in the direction of their motion.\nFurthermore, we assume that the typical transverse momenta of the produced particles is large compared to \u039bQCD .

What is the ratio of produced strange/nonstrange\nmesons, and corresponding ratios of charm, top, bottom etc at y = 0\nas the center of mass energy approaches infinity? Does multiparticle\nproduction as s \u2192 \u221e at y = 0 become simple, understandable and\ncomputable?\nNote\nparticles with pz = 0 or p+ =\n\u221a that y = 0 corresponds\n\u221a to\n\u221a\n+\nm\u22a5 / 2, for which x = m\u22a5 /( 2p1 ) = m\u22a5 / s is small, x \u226a 1, in\nthe high-energy limit of interest. Thus the multiparticle production at\ncentral rapidity reflects properties of the small-x degrees of freedom in\nthe colliding hadron wavefunctions.\nThere is a remarkable feature of rapidity distributions of produced\nhadrons, generally referred to as either Feynman scaling or Limiting\nFragmentation. If we plot rapidity distributions of produced hadrons at\ndifferent energies, then as function of y \u2212yproj , the rapidity distributions\nare to a good approximation independent of energy. This is illustrated in\nFig. 3, where the rapidity distribution measured at one energy is shown\nwith a solid line and the rapidity distribution at a different, higher,\nenergy is shown with a dotted line. In this plot, the rapidity distribution\nat the lower energy has been shifted by an amount so that particles of\npositive rapidity begin their distribution at the same yproj as the high\nenergy particles, and correspondingly for the negative rapidity particles.\nThis of course leads to a gap in the center for the low energy particles\n\n7\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\n8\n\n21:22\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Review Volume\n\nQGP3 \u0307final \u0307web\n\nThe Color Glass Condensate and High Energy Scattering in QCD\n\ndue to this mapping.\nThis means that as we go to higher and higher energies, the new\nphysics is associated with the additional degrees of freedom at small\nrapidities in the center of mass frame (small-x degrees of freedom). The\nlarge x degrees of freedom do not change much. This suggests that there\nmay be some sort of renormalization group description in rapidity where\nthe degrees of freedom at larger x are held fixed as we go to smaller\nvalues of x. We shall see that in fact these large x degrees of freedom act\nas sources for the small x degrees of freedom, and the renormalization\ngroup is generated by integrating out degrees of freedom at relatively\nlarge x to generate these sources.

Deep Inelastic Scattering\nIn the previous section, we discussed hadron-hadron collisions in which\nlarge numbers of particles are produced. Here we will discuss Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) of a lepton scattering off a hadronic target 6 .\nFewer particles are produced in DIS, so this provides a relatively clean\nenvironment to study QCD at high energies. In Fig. 4 is shown the cartoon of a DIS experiment.\nTo describe quark distributions, it is convenient to work in a reference\nframe where the hadron has a large light-cone longitudinal momentum\nP + \u226b M (\"infinite momentum frame\"). In this frame, one can describe\nthe hadron as a collection of constituents (\"partons\"), which are nearly\non-shell excitations carrying some fraction x of the total longitudinal\nmomentum P + . (The correct mathematical formulation of this picture\ninvolves the light cone quantization mentioned previously: the hadron\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\n21:22\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Review Volume\n\nQGP3 \u0307final \u0307web\n\n9\n\nThe Color Glass Condensate and High Energy Scattering in QCD\n\nelectron\n\nphoton\n\nquark\nhadron\n\nFig. 4.\n\nDeep inelastic scattering of an electron on a hadron.\n\ncan then be expressed in a \"quark-parton\" basis.) Thus, the longitudinal\nmomentum of a parton is p+ = xP + , with 0 \u2264 x < 1.\nFor the struck quark in Fig. 4, this x variable (\"Feynman x\") is equal\n(modulo target mass corrections) to the empirical Bjorken variable xBj ,\nwhich is defined in a frame independent way as xBj = Q2 /2P * q. In this\ndefinition, Q2 = \u2212q \u03bc q\u03bc , with q \u03bc the (space-like) 4-momentum of the\nexchanged photon. The Bjorken variable scales like xBj \u223c Q2 /s, with\ns = the invariant energy squared. Thus, in deep inelastic scattering at\nhigh energy (large s at fixed Q2 ) we measure the quark distributions\ndNquark /dx at small x (x \u226a 1).\nIt is again useful to think about these distributions as a function of\nrapidity. We define this for deep inelastic scattering as y = yhadron \u2212\nln(1/x), and the invariant rapidity distribution as dN/dy = xdN/dx. At\nhigh Q2 , the measured quark and gluon distribution functions are simply\nrelated (at least, in a leading order approximation) to the number of\npartons per unit rapidity in the hadronic wavefunction.\nThe typical dN/dy distribution for constituent gluons of a hadron as\nmeasured in DIS is similar to the rapidity distribution of produced particles in hadron-hadron collisions (see Fig. 2). This suggests a relationship\nbetween the structure functions in DIS and the rapidity distributions\nfor particles produced in hadronic collisions. We expect the gluon distribution function to be proportional to the pion rapidity distribution.\nThis relation is plausible (since the degrees of freedom of the gluons\nshould not be lost) and is incorporated in many models of multi-particle\nproduction.\nThe small x problem is that in experiments at HERA, the rapidity\ndistribution functions for quarks and gluons grow rapidly as the rapidity\ndifference\n\u03c4 \u2261 ln(1/x) = yhadron \u2212 y\n\n(1.7)\n\nbetween the quark and the hadron increases 7 .

The gluon distribution is the number of gluons per\nunit rapidity in the hadron wavefunction, xG(x, Q2 ) = dNgluons /dy .\nExperimentally, it is extracted from the data for the quark structure\nfunctions, by analyzing the dependence of the latter upon the resolution\nQ2 of the probe.\nThe growth seen in Fig. 5 appears to be more rapid than \u03c4 or \u03c4 2 .\nPerturbative considerations of the high energy limit in QCD by Lipatov\nand colleagues lead to an evolution equation commonly called the BFKL\nequation 8 which suggests that distributions may grow as an exponential\nin \u03c4 8,9 . Alternatively, the double logarithmic DGLAP evolution equa\u221a\ntion 10 predicts a less rapid growth, like an exponential in \u03c4 .

Consider Fig. 6, where we view the hadron head\non. The constituents are the valence quarks, gluons and sea quarks, all\nshown as colored circles. As we add more and more constituents, the\nhadron becomes more and more densely populated. If one attempts to\nresolve these constituents with an elementary probe, as in DIS, then, at\nsufficiently small x (for a given transverse resolution), the density of the\nconstituents becomes so large that one cannot neglect their mutual interactions any longer. One expects such interactions to give \"shadowing\"\nby which we imply a decrease of the scattering cross-section relative to\nwhat is expected from incoherent independent scattering.\nMore precisely, we shall see later that, as a effect of these interac-\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\n21:22\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Review Volume\n\nQGP3 \u0307final \u0307web\n\n11\n\nThe Color Glass Condensate and High Energy Scattering in QCD\n\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\nGluon\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0 Density\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0 Grows\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n\nFig. 6.\n\n00000\n11111\n000\n111\n11111\n00000\n000\n111\n00000\n11111\n000\n111\n00000\n11111\n000\n111\n00000\n11111\n000\n111\n00000\n11111\n000\n111\n00000\n11111\n000\n111\n00000\n11111\n00000\n11111\n0000\n1111\n00000\n11111\n0000\n1111\n00000\n11111\n0000\n1111\n00000\n11111\n0000\n1111\n00000\n11111\n0000\n1111\n00000\n11111\n0000\n1111\n00000\n11111\n0000\n1111\n00000\n11111\n0000\n1111\n00000\n11111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n\n000 111\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n00\n11\n000\n111\n000\n111\n00\n11\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n0011\n11\n000\n111\n00\n000\n111\n000\n111\n00\n11\n000\n111\n00\n000\n111\n000\n111\n0011\n11\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n00\n000\n111\n00\n11\n11\n00\n0000 11\n1111\n000 11\n111\n00\n11\n000\n111\n00\n00\n11\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n00\n11\n000\n111\n00\n11\n00111\n11\n0000\n1111\n00011\n111\n000\n111\n00\n000\n000\n111\n000\n111\n00\n11\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n00\n11\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n00000\n11111\n00\n11\n000\n111\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n00\n11\n000\n111\n000\n111\n00000\n11111\n00\n11\n000\n111\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n00000\n11111\n00\n11\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n00000\n11111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n00000\n11111\n000\n111\n00\n000\n111\n000\n111\n00111\n11\n000\n00000\n11111\n000 11\n111\n000\n111\n00000\n11111\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n00\n11\n000\n111\n00000\n11111\n00000\n11111\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n00\n11\n000\n111\n000\n111\n00000\n11111\n00\n11\n00000\n11111\n000\n0000\n1111\n0011\n11\n000\n111\n000\n111\n00000111\n11111\n00\n00000\n11111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n00\n11\n000\n111\n000\n111\n00000\n11111\n00\n11\n000\n111\n000\n111\n00000\n11111\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n00000\n11111\n00\n11\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n00000\n11111\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n00\n11\n000\n111\n00000\n11111\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n00000\n11111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n00\n11\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n00000\n11111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n00111\n11\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n00000\n11111\n000\n000\n111\n000\n111\n00\n11\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n00000\n11111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n00000\n11111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n00\n00011\n111\n000\n111\n00\n11\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n00\n11\n000\n111\n00\n11\n0000\n1111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n000\n111\n0000\n1111\n00\n11\n00\n000\n111\n00\n11\n000\n111\n000 11\n111\n00\n11\n0000\n1111\n00\n11\n00\n11\n000\n111\n00\n11\n000\n111\n000\n111\n00\n11\n00\n11\n00\n11\n00 111\n11\n000\n000\n111\n00\n11\n00\n000\n111\n00\n11\n000\n111\n00 11\n11\n00011\n111\n00\n11\n00\n000\n111\n00\n11\n00\n00011\n111\n\nLow Energy\n\nHigh Energy\n\nSaturation of gluons in a hadron.

For a\ngiven Q2 , this saturation occurs if x is low enough, lower than some critical value xs (Q2 ). Converserly, for given x, saturation occurs for transverse momenta below some critical value Q2s (x), defined as\nQ2s (x) = \u03b1s Nc\n\n1 dN\n,\n\u03c0R2 dy\n\n(1.8)\n\nwhere dN/dy is the gluon distribution at y = yhadron \u2212 ln(1/x). Only\ngluons are included, since, at high energy, the gluon density grows much\nfaster than the quark density, and is the driving force towards saturation.\nThis explains why in the following we shall focus primarily on the gluons.\nIn Eq. (1.8), \u03c0R2 is the hadron area in the impact parameter space (or\ntransverse plane). This is well defined provided the wavelength of the\nprobe is small compared to R, which we assume throughout. Finally,\n\u03b1s Nc is the color charge squared of a single gluon. Thus, the \"saturation\nscale\" (1.8) has the meaning of the average color charge squared of the\ngluons per unit transverse area per unit rapidity.\nSince the gluon distribution increases rapidly with the energy, as\nthe HERA data suggests, so does the saturation scale.

This suggests that weak coupling techniques can be\nused to study the high energy regime in QCD.\nHowever, weak coupling does not necessarily mean that the physics\nis perturbative. There are many examples of nonperturbative phenomena at weak coupling. An example is instantons in electroweak theory,\nwhich lead to the violation of baryon number. Another example is the\natomic physics of highly charged nuclei. Although the electromagnetic\ncoupling constant is very weak, \u03b1em \u226a 1, the large charge Z of the\natoms introduces a scale Z\u03b1em \u223c 1 producing a strong nuclear Coulomb\nfield in which the electron propagates. Nevertheless, there is a systematic\ntechnique which enables one to compute the non-perturbative properties of high Z atoms. Yet another example is QCD at high temperature\nT \u226b \u039bQCD ; this is a weakly coupled quark-gluon plasma, but exhibits\nnonperturbative phenomena on large distances r \u226b 1/T due to the collective behaviour of many quanta 21 .\nSimilarly, the small-x gluons with transverse momenta Q2 \u2264 Q2s (x)\nmake a high density system, in which the interaction probability \u03c3 \u00d7 n\n(where \u03c3 \u223c \u03b1s /Q2 is the typical parton cross-section and n is the gluon\n2\n11,12,13 (cf. Eq. (1.8)). That is,\ndensity, n = dN\ndy /\u03c0R ) is of order one\nalthough the coupling is small, \u03b1s (Q2s ) \u226a 1, the effects of the interactions are amplified by the large gluon density and ordinary perturbation\ntheory breaks down. A resummation of the high density effects is therefore necessary. Our strategy, to be developed in the following sections,\nwill be to construct an effective theory - the Color Glass Condensate\n14,25,26,23,20 - in which the small-x gluons are described as the classical color fields radiated by \"color sources\" at higher rapidity. Physically,\nthese sources are the \"fast\" partons, i.e., the hadron constituents with\nlarger longitudinal momenta p+ \u226b xP + . The properties of the color\nsources will be obtained via a renormalization group analysis, in which\nthe \"fast\" partons are integrated out in steps of rapidity and in the\nbackground of the classical field generated at the previous step 22,23 .\n\n1.6. Nucleus-Nucleus and Proton-Nucleus Collisions\nIn Fig. 7, we plot a cartoon of the space-time evolution of a heavy ion\ncollision 24 . Imagine we have two Lorentz contracted nuclei approaching\none another at the speed of light. We choose coordinates such as the\ncollision takes place at z = t = 0, or x+ = x\u2212 = 0. Since the two nuclei\nare well localized in the longitudinal direction, they can be thought of as\nsitting at z \u2243 t (x\u2212 = 0) for the right mover, respectively at z \u2243 \u2212t (or\nx+ = 0) for the left mover. To analyze this problem for t \u2265 0, namely,\nafter the collision takes place, it is convenient to introduce a time variable\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\n21:22\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Review Volume\n\nQGP3 \u0307final \u0307web\n\n13\n\nThe Color Glass Condensate and High Energy Scattering in QCD\n\nt\n\nHadron\n\nGas\nQGP\nThermalization\nParton Formation\nz\n\nFig. 7.\n\nA space-time figure for ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions.\n\nwhich is Lorentz invariant under longitudinal boostsa \u03c4 =\n\"proper time\") and a space-time rapidity variable\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\nt+z\nx+\n1\n\u03b7 =\nln\nln \u2212 .\n=\n2\nt\u2212z\n2\nx\n\n\u221a\n\nt2 \u2212 z 2 (the\n(1.10)\n\nFor free streaming particles with velocity vz (z = vz t = pEz t), the spacetime rapidity equals the momentum space rapidity (1.4): \u03b7 = y. We\nshall see later that this identification remains approximately true also\nfor the off-shell quantum fluctuations (the partons) with relatively large\nlongitudinal momenta.\nAt high energies, in the central rapidity region, particle distributions\nvary slowly and it should be a good approximation to take them to be\nrapidity invariant and therefore also independent of \u03b7. Therefore distributions are the same on the lines of constant proper time \u03c4 , which are\nshown in Fig. 7.\nAn outstanding problem is to formulate the initial conditions for a\nheavy ion collision and to study the subsequent evolution of the produced\npartons. Can one argue from first principles that the partonic matter will\nthermalize into a quark-gluon plasma ?\nThere are two separate classes of problems one has to understand\nfor the initial conditions. Firstly, the two nuclei which are colliding are\ncoherent quantum mechanical wavepackets. Therefore, for some early\ntime, the degrees of freedom must be quantum mechanical. This means,\nin particular,\n\u2206z\u2206pz \u2265 1 ,\n\na This\n\n(1.11)\n\nshould not be confused with the rapidity variable introduced previously, in\neq. (1.7), and which will not appear in this subsection.\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\n14\n\n21:22\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Review Volume\n\nQGP3 \u0307final \u0307web\n\nThe Color Glass Condensate and High Energy Scattering in QCD\n\nwhich particularly constrains the small-x gluons, which are delocalized\nover large longitudinal distances \u2206z \u223c 1/pz , and thus overlap with each\nother. Such degrees of freedom cannot be described by semi\u2013classical\ntransport theory for particles. (Classical particles are characterized by a\ndistribution function f (~\np, ~x, t), which is a simultaneous function of momenta and coordinates.) However, fortuitously, quantum coherent states\ncan be described as classical fields because they have large occupation\nnumbers \u223c 1/\u03b1s \u226b 1. Heisenberg commutators between particle creation and annihilation operators become negligible in this limit:\n[ak , a\u2020k ] = 1 \u226a a\u2020k ak = Nk .\n\n(1.12)\n\nClassical field theory is also the appropriate language to describe another\nimportant feature of the initial conditions, namely the classical charge\ncoherence. At very early times, we have a tremendously large number\nof particles packed into a longitudinal size scale of less than a fermi due\nto the Lorentz contraction of the nuclei. We know that such particles\ncannot interact incoherently. For example, if we measure the field due\nto two opposite charges (a dipole) at a distance scale r large compared\nto their separation, the field falls off as 1/r 2 , not 1/r. On the other\nhand, in parton cascade models, interactions are taken into account by\ncross-sections which involve matrix elements squared leaving no room for\nclassical charge coherence. These models should therefore not be applied\nat very early times.\nAs an effective theory at small x, the Color Glass Condensate can be\napplied to study the initial stages of a heavy ion collision 29,30,33 . The\nonly scales in the problem are the saturation scale Qs and the transverse\nsize of the system R. On a time scale \u03c4 \u223c 1/Qs , the initial energy and\nnumber distributions of gluons can be computed by solving classical field\nequations. At later times \u03c4 \u226b 1/Qs , the system becomes dilute and the\nclassical field approximation breaks down, but one in terms of transport\nequations becomes valid. There is presumably an overlap region where\nthe two descriptions can be both correct 35 . At early times, the distribution of gluons in momentum space is primarily transverse. As the\nsystem becomes dilute, the gluons begin to scatter \"off the transverse\nplane\". Baier, Mueller, Schiff and Son 34 have argued that 2\u2192 3 processes are those which lead to the most efficient thermalization. Whether\non not the initial non-equilibrium gluon distributions thermalize to form\na quark gluon plasma at the energies of interest is of outstanding phenomenological interest at RHIC and LHC energies. It is also of interest\nto understand how much of the RHIC data can be understood purely\nfrom initial state effects 36,37,38,39 as opposed to the final state effects\nwhich are important for thermalization. Proton (or deuterium)\u2013nucleus\ncollisions should be very helpful in helping to isolate initial state effects\nfrom final state rescattering effects. In a proton-nucleus collision, one\ndoes not expect final state rescattering to dominate the measured parti-\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\n21:22\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Review Volume\n\nQGP3 \u0307final \u0307web\n\nThe Color Glass Condensate and High Energy Scattering in QCD\n\n15\n\ncle spectrum. Initial state effects, on the other hand, should be especially\nimportant in the proton fragmentation region and have been computed\nrecently within the CGC framework 27,40,41,42 . The upcoming experiments at RHIC on deuterium-gold collisions will hopefully clarify the\nrole of initial/final state effects in high energy scattering.\n1.7. Universality of High Energy Scattering\nIn pion production, it is observed that, with the exception of globally\nconserved quantities like the energy and the total charge, the rapidity\ncorrelations are of short range. If the theory is local in rapidity, the\nonly dimensionful parameter which can determine the physics at a given\nrapidity is Q2s (x). For an approximately scale invariant theory such as\nQCD, a typical transverse momentum of a constituent will therefore be\nof order Q2s . If Q2s \u226b 1/R2 , where R is the radius of the hadron, the\nfinite size of the hadron becomes irrelevant. Thus at small enough x, all\nhadrons become the same-specific properties of the hadrons (like their\nsize or atomic number A) enter only via the saturation scale Q2s (x, A).\nHence there should be some equivalence between nuclei and protons:\nwhen their Q2s values are the same, their physics should be the same.\nEq. (1.8) suggests the following empirical parametrization of the saturation momentum:\nA1/3\n(1.13)\nx\u03bb\nwhere the value \u03bb \u223c 0.2 \u2212 0.3 seems to be preferred by both the data\n7,43 and the most recent theoretical calculations 44 . There should thus\nbe the following correspondence:\n\u2022 RHIC with nuclei \u223c HERA with protons\n\u2022 LHC with nuclei \u223c HERA with nuclei\nEstimates of the saturation scale for nuclei at RHIC energies give\nQs \u223c 1 \u2212 2 GeV, and at LHC 2 \u2212 3 GeV.\nThis further suggests that for relatively simple processes like deep\ninelastic scattering (at least), the observables should be universal functions of the ratio between the transferred momentum Q2 and the saturation scale Q2s (x, A). This feature, called \"geometric scaling\", is rather\nwell satisfied by the proton structure functions measured at HERA, for\nall values of Bjorken x smaller than 0.01 and in a broad region of Q2\n(between 0.045 and 450 GeV2 ) 45 . Interestingly, the observed scaling\nextends up to relatively large values of Q2 , well above the saturation\nscale Q2s (x), which suggests that the phenomenon of gluon saturation at\nQ2 \u2264 Q2s (x) has a rather strong influence also on the physics at much\nlarger Q2 46 .\nThe previous considerations suggest how to reconcile unitarity with\nthe growth of the gluon distribution function at small x. The point is\nthat the smaller x is the larger Qs (x) is and thus and the typical partons\nQ2s (x, A) \u223c\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\n16\n\n21:22\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Review Volume\n\nQGP3 \u0307final \u0307web\n\nThe Color Glass Condensate and High Energy Scattering in QCD\n\nare smaller. Therefore, when decreasing x, although we are increasing\nthe number of gluons, we do it by adding in more gluons of smaller and\nsmaller size. A probe of transverse size resolution \u2206x\u22a5 \u223c 1/Q will not\nsee partons smaller than this resolution size. Thus when Q < Qs , newly\ncreated partons will not contribute to the cross-section.\n2. The Effective Theory for the Color Glass Condensate\n2.1. The hadron wavefunction at small x\nAs discussed in Sect. 1.2, a relativistic quantum field theory quantized\non the lightcone has a simple structure in terms of the bare quanta or\n\"partons\" of the theory. For instance, in QCD, the eigenstates of the\n\u2212\nlight-cone Hamiltonian PQCD\ncan be expressed as a linear superposition of the eigenstates of the non-interacting part of the Hamiltonian\n\u2212\n\u2212\nPQCD,0\n= PQCD\n\u2212 VQCD , where VQCD is the LC potential. The proton\nwavefunction for instance can be written in this parton basis as\n|\u03c8 >= c1 |qqq > +c2 |qqqg > + * * * + cn |qqqgggg...q q\u0304gg > + * * * .\n\n(2.1)\n\nIt is a priori not obvious what the advantage of such a decomposition is.\nThe magic of the parton model is that, at high energies, it is apparent\nfrom the structure of VQCD that the interactions of the partons with\neach other are time dilated. The very complicated picture of the scattering of the proton off an external potential can be replaced with the\nsimple picture of individual partons scattering off the external potential.\n(In the eikonal approximation, each of these partons acquires a simple\nphase in the scattering 47 .) At lower energies, the Fock states involving\nlarge numbers of partons are not very important but at higher energies they are increasingly important, and involve predominantly gluons.\nSince the total LC momentum of the proton P + is divided among a large\nnumber of partons, a typical parton will carry a momentum k+ << P + ,\ni.e., only a small fraction x = k+ /P + of the proton total momentum.\nUnderstanding the physics of QCD at high energies or small x thus requires that we understand the properties of the n-gluon components of\nthe hadron's LC wavefunction.\nA very interesting approach to computing the properties of the ngluon component of the hadronic wavefunction is Mueller's color dipole\napproach for heavy quarkonia 48 . This is valid in the limit where the\nnumber of colors Nc is large, so the gluons can be effectively replaced\nby q q\u0304 pairs (\"color dipoles\"). It will be shown later that this approach\nand the CGC formalism give identical results for the evolution of distributions in x, in this large-Nc limit.\nThe CGC approach that we shall follow here is to construct a coarse\ngrained effective theory for the small-x component of the hadron LC\nwavefunction. We shall first consider a large nucleus, for which this construction is most intuitive. Then, we shall argue that, at sufficiently large\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\n21:22\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Review Volume\n\nQGP3 \u0307final \u0307web\n\n17\n\nThe Color Glass Condensate and High Energy Scattering in QCD\n\nenergy, or small enough x, a similar theory can be constructed for any\nhadron, via weak coupling calculations in QCD.\n2.2. The McLerran-Venugopalan model for a large nucleus\nConsider a nucleus in the infinite momentum frame (IMF) with momentum P + \u2192 \u221e. We will assume that the nucleus is of nearly infinite\ntransverse extent with a uniform nuclear matter distribution. As we will\ndiscuss later, the model can be extended to include realistic nuclear\ndensity profiles. In the IMF, partons which carry large fractions of the\nnuclear momentum (\"valence\" partons), are Lorentz contracted to a distance \u223c 2R/\u03b3, with \u03b3 = P + /mp and mp the mass of the proton. The\n\"wee\" partons with momentum fractions x \u226a 1 are delocalized in the\nx\u2212 direction over much larger distances: a simple kinematic estimate\nsuggests that partons with momentum fraction x \u226a A\u22121/3 are delocalized over distances larger than the nuclear diameter. These partons then\n\"see\" the partons at large x as infinitely thin sources of color charge. The\nmodel assumes a simple kinematic distinction between wee and valence\npartons. The reality is more complex as we will discuss later but certain\nkey features of this simple model will survive.\nAnother salient feature of wee partons is their very short lifetimes.\nTheir lifetime on the lightcone, \u2206x+ , is, from the uncertainity principle, conjugate to their light cone energy: \u2206x+ \u223c 1/k\u2212 . From the\nlight cone dispersion relation, k\u2212 = m2\u22a5 /2k+ \u2261 m2\u22a5 /2xP + . Thus\n\u2206x+ \u223c xP + /m2\u22a5 is proportional to x. These estimates imply that wee\nparton lifetime is much shorter than that of the valence partons: on\nthe scale of the lifetime of the former, the latter appear to live forever.\nThe valence parton sources are thus static sources of color charge. Since\ntheir momenta are large, they are unaffected by absorbing or emitting\nsoft quanta: they are recoilless sources of color charge. In this \"eikonal\"\napproximation, the wee parton cloud couples only to the \"plus\" component of the LC current, which, from the discussion here, can be written\nas (see also Sect. 2.3 below) :\n\na\n\nJ \u03bc,a = \u03b4 \u03bc+ \u03b4(x\u2212 )\u03c1a (x\u22a5 ) ,\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhere \u03c1 (x\u22a5 ) is the valence quark color charge density in the transverse plane. The \u03b4-funtion in x\u2212 assumes an infinitely thin sheet of color\ncharge. The assumption can and must be relaxed; namely, \u03c1a (x\u22a5 ) \u2192\n\u03c1a (x\u22a5 , x\u2212 ) as we will discuss later. Note that \u03c1a is static, i.e., independent of the LC time x+ , for the reasons explained previously.\nWe now turn to the color charge density \u03c1a (x\u22a5 ) and how it is generated. We assume that the nucleus is interacting with an external probe\nwhich can resolve distances of size \u2206x\u22a5 in the transverse plane that\nare much smaller than the nucleon size \u223c \u039bQCD . Now, in the longitudinal direction, the small probe which has x \u226a A\u22121/3 simultaneously\ncouples to partons from nucleons all along the nuclear diameter.

The choice of a gauge will however soon become an issue\nwhen we shall study the dynamics of the gluons radiated by this random\ndistribution of color charges.\nThe local Gaussian form of the weight function in Eq. (2.6) is valid,\nby construction, for a large nucleus, and within some restricted kinematical range that we spell here again, for more clarity. As already discussed, this is correct for a transverse resolution Q2 \u2261 1/\u2206S\u22a5 within\nthe range \u039b2QCD \u226a Q2 \u226a \u039b2QCD A1/3 . But, clearly, the assumption that\nthe valence quarks are uncorrelated must fail for transverse separations\nof order R0 \u223c 1/\u039bQCD or larger, since the Nc = 3 valence quarks within\nthe same nucleon are confined in a color singlet state. Thus, the total\ncolor charge, together with its higher multipolar moments, must vanish\nwhen measured over distances of the order of the nucleon size R0 , or\nlarger. As emphasized by Lam and Mahlon 49 (see also Ref. 50 for an\nearlier discussion), the requirement of color neutrality can be included\nin the Gaussian weight function by replacing the \u03b4-function in eq. (2.5)\nwith h\u03c1a (x\u2212 , x\u22a5 )\u03c1b (0)i = \u03bb(x\u2212 , x\u22a5 )\u03b4 ab , where \u03bb(x\u2212 , x\u22a5 ) is such that its\nFourier transform \u03bb(x\u2212 , k\u22a5 ) vanishes rapidly at momenta k\u22a5 <\n\u223c \u039bQCD .\nConsider also the validity range of Eq. (2.6) in longitudinal momenta.\nAs explicit in the previous analysis, the color fields that we are computing have small values of x \u226a A\u22121/3 , that is, they carry longitudinal\nmomenta k+ much lower than those of their sources, the valence quarks.\nThus, the weight function (2.6) can be seen as part of an effective theory\nfor gluon correlations at momenta k+ smaller than some upper cutoff\n\u039b+ , of the order of the typical longitudinal momentum of the valence\nquarks. (This theory will be completely specified in Sects. 2.3\u20132.4.) Note\nhowever that, for the classical approximations underlying Eq. (2.6) to\nbe valid, the value k+ of interest should be not much smaller than \u039b+ .\nIndeed, as we shall see, new color sources with momenta p+ < \u039b+ are\nproduced by radiation from the original sources at p+ \u2265 \u039b+ . If the gap\nbetween k+ and \u039b+ is relatively large - the precise condition is that\n\u03b1s Nc ln(\u039b+ /k+ ) \u2265 1 - these new sources, which are mostly gluons, will\ncompletely dominate the physics at the scale k+ of interest. As we shall\nin Sect. 3, these new sources can be explicitly constructed by integrating\nout layers of quantum fluctuations in a renormalization group analysis,\nbut the ensuing weight function is generally not a Gaussian. Still, the\nGaussian (2.6) may be a good initial condition for this quantum evolution. Moreover, rather remarkably, it turns out that this is also a good\napproximation in the quantum theory, but with a non-trivial transverse\nmomentum dependence for the 2-point function \u03bb that will be specified\nin Sect. 3.\n\n19\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\n20\n\n21:22\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Review Volume\n\nQGP3 \u0307final \u0307web\n\nThe Color Glass Condensate and High Energy Scattering in QCD\n\n2.3. The Color Glass\nOnce the weight function for the classical color charge configurations\nassociated with the large-x partons is known, it is possible to write down\nan effective theory for the small-x gluons. The generating functional for\nthe correlation functions of the small-x gluons reads 23 :\n\uf8f1 +\n\uf8fc\nR\nZ\n\uf8f2 R \u039b DA \u03b4(A+ ) e iS[A, \u03c1]\u2212 j*A \uf8fd\nZ[j] =\nD\u03c1 W\u039b+ [\u03c1]\n,\n(2.7)\n\uf8f3 R \u039b+ DA \u03b4(A+ ) e iS[A, \u03c1]\n\uf8fe\n\nwhere the external current ja\u03bc is a formal device to generate Green's\nfunctions via differentiations, and S[A, \u03c1] is the action that describes\nthe dynamics of the wee gluons in the presence of the classical color\ncharge \u03c1 (see below). The path integral over the gluon fields is written\nin the light cone (LC) gauge A+\na = 0, since this is the gauge which allows\nfor the most direct partonic interpretation. Correspondingly, \u03c1a is the\ncolor charge density in the LC gauge.\nNote the dependence upon the intermediate longitudinal momentum\ncutoff \u039b+ in the integrals in Eq. (2.7). As explained at the end of the\nprevious subsection, \u039b+ is the scale which separates the 'fast' partons\n(p+ > \u039b+ ), which have been 'integrated out' and replaced by the classical color charge \u03c1a , from the 'wee' gluons (k+ < \u039b+ ), for which the\neffective theory is meant, and which are still explicit in the path integral, as the gauge fields A\u03bc\na . Since obtained after integrating out the\nmodes with p+ > \u039b+ (see Sect. 3), the weight function W\u039b+ [\u03c1] depends\nupon the separation scale \u039b+ . Clearly, \u039b+ must be chosen such that\n\u039b+ /P + \u2265 x, with x the longitudinal fraction of interest.\nFor instance, for a large nucleus at not so high energies (e.g., a gold\nnucleus at RHIC) we have x \u2243 10\u22121 \u2212 10\u22122 , so we can neglect the\nquantum evolution in a first approximation, and identify \u03c1 with the\ncolor charge of the valence quarks. Then, we can use the MV model\ndescribed previously, in which case W\u039b+ [\u03c1] \u2261 WA [\u03c1] is the Gaussian\nweight function given by Eqs. (2.6) and (2.5).\nBut for smaller values of x (say x < 10\u22123 ), as relevant for DIS at\nHERA, and also for nucleus-nucleus scattering at LHC, quantum effects\nare essential, so \u03c1 must include the color sources generated by quantum\nevolution down to \u039b+ . As we shall see in Sect. 3, these sources are predominantly gluons. Thus, in what follows, we shall restrict the quantum\nevolution to the gluonic sector; that is, the only fermions to be included\namong the color sources are the valence quarks in the initial condition.\nIf the scale k+ = xP + of interest is of order \u039b+ , or slightly below it,\nthe correlation functions at that scale can be computed in the classical\napproximation, i.e., by evaluating the path integral over A\u03bc in Eq. (2.7)\nin the saddle point approximation. There are two reasons for that: a)\nThe quantum corrections due to gluons in the intermediate range k+ <\np+ < \u039b+ are, at most, of order \u03b1s ln(\u039b+ /k+ ), and thus are truly higher\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\n21:22\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Review Volume\n\nQGP3 \u0307final \u0307web\n\n21\n\nThe Color Glass Condensate and High Energy Scattering in QCD\n\norder effects as long as ln(\u039b+ /k+ ) <\n\u223c 1. b) The small-x gluons have large\noccupation numbers \u226b 1 (as we shall see, at saturation the occupation\nnumbers are parametrically of order 1/\u03b1s ), so their mutual interactions\ncan be treated in the classical approximation, i.e., by solving the classical\nfield equations \u03b4S/\u03b4A\u03bc = 0, or, more explicitly:\n(D\u03bd F \u03bd\u03bc )a (x) = \u03b4 \u03bc+ \u03c1a (~x) ,\n\n(2.8)\n\nwhere D\u03bd = \u2202\u03bd \u2212 igAa\u03bd T a with (T a )bc = \u2212ifabc .\nNote however that, precisely because the occupation numbers are so\nlarge, the corresponding classical fields are strong (Ai \u223c 1/g at saturation), and thus the classical non-linearities must be treated exactly. In\nparticular, we need the exact solution to the classical equations of motion (EOM) (2.8), that we shall construct in the next subsection. Once\nthis solution is known as an explicit functional of \u03c1, the correlation functions of interest are obtained by averaging over \u03c1, with weight function\nW\u039b+ [\u03c1]. For instance, the 2-point function is computed as:\nZ\n+\n\u03bd +\nhA\u03bc\n(x\n,\n~\nx\n)A\n(x\n,\n~\ny\n)i\n=\nD\u03c1 W\u039b+ [\u03c1] A\u03bc\nx)A\u03bdb (~\ny) ,\n(2.9)\n+\na\na (~\nb\n\u039b\n\u03bc\nwhere A\u03bc\na \u2261 Aa [\u03c1] is the solution to Eq. (2.8), and is independent of the\n+\nLC time x (because so is the source \u03c1a (~x)). This means that only equaltime correlators can be computed in this way; but these are precisely the\ncorrelators of interest for small-x scattering.\nThe remaining question is: What is the weight function W\u039b+ [\u03c1] for\n\u039b+ \u226a P + ? As we shall see in Sect. 3, this can be answered via a quantum calculation, the result of which will allow us to compute W\u039b+ in\nterms of the initial condition W\u039b+ , by integrating out the gluons with\n0\n\n+\n+\nmomenta p+ in the range \u039b+\n0 < p < \u039b . For the purpose of this calculation, we need to also specify\nR the action S[A, \u03c1] in Eq. (2.8). The simple\nguess S[A, \u03c1] = SYM [A] + x \u03c1a A\u2212\na (which would generate the classical\nEOM (2.8)) cannot be right since the second term, involving \u03c1, is not\ngauge-invariant. This reflects the fact that, written as in Eq. (2.8), the\nclassical EOM is not manifestly gauge-covariant either. In fact, Eq. (2.8)\nis correct as written only for field configurations having A\u2212\na = 0. This\nis not a limitation for classical calculations, since it is always possible\nto construct a classical solution having this property. But Eq. (2.8) is\nnot sufficient to determine S[A, \u03c1], which is explicitly needed for the\nquantum calculation.\nTo find the general equation which replaces Eq. (2.8) in some ar\u03bc\nbitrary gauge (where A\u2212\na 6= 0), notice that, in general, the current Ja\nin the r.h.s. of the Yang-Mills equations must satisfy the covariant conservation law D\u03bc J \u03bc = 0 (since we also have D\u03bc D\u03bd F \u03bd\u03bc = 0). For the\neikonal current (2.2), this implies D\u2212 J + \u2261 ( \u2202x\u2202+ \u2212 igA\u2212 )J + = 0, which\nreduces indeed to \u2202 \u2212 \u03c1 = 0 when A\u2212 = 0. But in general, this is satisfied\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\n22\n\n21:22\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Review Volume\n\nQGP3 \u0307final \u0307web\n\nThe Color Glass Condensate and High Energy Scattering in QCD\n\nby J + (x+ , ~x) = W (x+, ~x) \u03c1(~x) W \u2020 (x+ , ~x).

(2.7) and\n(2.9) is that of a Color Glass 23,50 . Note indeed the special structure of\nthe 2-point function that follows from Eq. (2.7):\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f1 +\nZ\n\uf8f2 R \u039b DA A\u03bc (x)A\u03bd (y) e iS[A, \u03c1] \uf8fd\n\u03bc\n\u03bd\n.

One thus solves the dynamics of the wee gluons at a\nfixed distribution of color charges, and only then averages over the latter.\nThere is no feedback from the evolution of the sources on the wee gluon\nfields. And there is no interference between successive configurations of\nthe color sources. These features, together with the large fluctuations in\nthe color charge density, are the ultimate reasons for treating the large-x\npartons as forming a classical random distribution.\nThe prototype of a glass is the \"spin glass\"\u2013a collection of magnetic\nimpurities randomly distributed on a non-magnetic lattice. The dynamical degrees of freedom, which are rapidly varying, are the magnetic\nmoments of the impurities (the \"spins\"), while the slowly varying disorder refers to the positions of these spins in the host lattice. To study the\nthermodynamics of such a system, one first computes the free-energy (=\nthe logarithm of the partition function) of the spin system for a fixed\ndisorder (namely, for a given spatial configuration of the impurities),\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\n21:22\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Review Volume\n\nQGP3 \u0307final \u0307web\n\n23\n\nThe Color Glass Condensate and High Energy Scattering in QCD\n\nand subsequently makes an average over all such configurations, with\nsome weight function. The final average over the configurations is not\na thermal one: what is averaged is the free-energy computed separately\nfor each configuration.\nSimilarly, the connected correlation functions of the small-x gluons in\nthe present effective theory are obtained from the following generating\nfunctional:\n!\nZ\nZ\nF [ja\u03bc ] =\n\n\u039b\n\nD\u03c1 W\u039b [\u03c1] ln\n\nDA \u03b4(A+ ) e iS[A, \u03c1]\u2212i\n\nR\n\nj*A\n\n,\n\n(2.14)\n\nwhere the logarithm is taken inside the integral over \u03c1. That is, the freeenergy reaches its extremum as a function of the external source j for\na fixed distribution of the color sources. The measured free-energy (or\ncorrelation function) is finally obtained by also averaging over \u03c1.\nNote that the presence of a non-trivial color charge background\nbreaks gauge symmetry explicitly. But this symmetry is restored in the\nprocess of averaging over \u03c1 provided the weight function is gauge invariant, which we shall assume in what follows.\n2.4. The classical color field\nIn this subsection, we shall construct the solution to the classical EOM\n(2.8). We note first that, for a large class of gauges, one can always find\na solution with the following properties 20 :\nFaij = 0,\n\nA\u2212\na = 0,\n\ni\nA+\na , Aa : static ,\n\n(2.15)\n\nwhere \"static\" means independent of x+ . This follows from the specific\nstructure of the color source which has just a \"+\" component, and is\nstatic. Since F ij = 0, the transverse fields Ai form a two-dimensional\npure gauge; that is, there exists a gauge rotation U (x\u2212 , x\u22a5 ) \u2208 SU(N )\nsuch that:\nAi (x\u2212 , x\u22a5 ) =\n\ni\nU (x\u2212 , x\u22a5 ) \u2202 i U \u2020 (x\u2212 , x\u22a5 ) .\ng\n\n(2.16)\n\n(in matrix notations appropriate for the adjoint representation: Ai =\nAia T a , etc). Thus, the requirements (2.15) leave just two independent\nfield degrees of freedom, A+ (~x) and U (~x), which are further reduced to\none (either A+ or U ) by imposing a gauge-fixing condition.\nWe consider first the covariant gauge \u2202\u03bc A\u03bc = 0. By eqs. (2.15) and\n(2.16), this implies \u2202i Ai = 0, or U = 0.

(As before, we assume a homogeneous distribution in the\ntransverse plane, for simplicity.)\nFor illustration, let us compute the gluon distribution of a nucleus\nin the MV model.

(2.31) are in fact the expected results, which could have been\nobtained also by a direct analysis of the gluon radiation by a single quark,\ntogether with the assumption that gluons radiated by different quarks\ndo not interact with each other, so that the total gluon distribution is\nsimply the sum of independent contributions from the A \u00d7 Nc valence\nquarks. This is the Weizs\u00e4cker\u2013Williams approximation for radiation off\nindependent quarks.\n2.6. Gluon saturation in a large nucleus\nAccording to eq. (2.31), the gluon density in the transverse phase-space\nis proportional to A1/3 , and becomes arbitrarily large when A increases.\nThis is however an artifact of our previous approximations which have\nneglected the interactions among the radiated gluons, i.e., the non-linear\neffects in the classical field equations.

This is defined by the condition that, for r\u22a5 = 2/Qs (A), the\nexponent in Eq. (2.39) becomes of order one, which gives:\nQ2s (A) \u2243 \u03b1s Nc \u03bc2A ln\n\nQ2s (A)\n\u223c A1/3 ln A .\n\u039b2QCD\n\n(2.41)\n\nNote that this is larger than QA , eq. (2.40), since we work in the hypothesis that QA \u226b \u039bQCD . Then we distinguish between two regimes:\ni) At high momenta k\u22a5 \u226b Qs (A), the integral is dominated by small\nr\u22a5 \u226a 1/Qs (A), and can be evaluated by expanding out the exponential.\nTo lowest non-trivial order (which corresponds to the linear approximation), one recovers the bremsstrahlung spectrum of eq. (2.31):\n\u03c6A (k\u22a5 ) \u2248\n\n\u03bc2\n1 Q2A\n= 2A\n2\n\u03b1s Nc k\u22a5\nk\u22a5\n\nfor\n\nk\u22a5 \u226b Q A .\n\n(2.42)\n\nii) At small momenta, k\u22a5 \u226a Qs (A), the dominant contribution comes\nfrom large distances r\u22a5 \u226b 1/Qs (A), where one can simply neglect the\n2\nexponential in the numerator and recognize 1/r\u22a5\nas the Fourier transb\n2\nform of ln k\u22a5 :\n\u03c6A (k\u22a5 ) \u2248\n\n1\nQ2 (A)\nln s 2\n\u03b1s Nc\nk\u22a5\n\nfor\n\nk\u22a5 \u226a Q A .\n\n(2.43)\n\nUnlike the linear distribution (2.42), which grows like A1/3 , and is\n2\nstrongly infrared dominated (as it goes like 1/k\u22a5\n), the distribution in\nEq. (2.43), which takes into account the non-linear effects in the classical\nYang-Mills equations, rises only logarithmically as a function of both A\n2\nand 1/k\u22a5\n. This is saturation. At saturation, the gluon occupation factor\nis parametrically of order 1/\u03b1s , which corresponds to a Bose condensate, and is the maximum density allowed\nby the repulsive interactions\np\nbetween the strong color fields \u0100i = hAi Ai i \u223c 1/g. When increasing\nthe atomic number A, the new gluons are produced preponderently at\nlarge transverse momenta >\n\u223c Qs (A). where this repulsion is less important. This is illustrated in Fig. 9.\nTo clarify the physical interpretation of the saturation scale, note\nthat, at short-distances r\u22a5 \u226a 1/Qs (A),\n\u03bc2A ln\n\n2\nxG(x, 1/r\u22a5\n)\n1\n\u221d\n2 \u039b2\n2 \u2212 1)\u03c0R2\nr\u22a5\n(N\nc\nA\nQCD\n\n(2.44)\n\nb The saturation scale provides the ultraviolet cutoff for the logarithm in eq.

Then, eq. (2.41)\nis the condition that the total color charge squared within the area occupied by each gluon is of order one. This is the original criterion of\nsaturation by Gribov, Levin and Ryskin 11 , for which the MV model\noffers an explicit realization.\nLet us finally compute the (integrated) gluon distribution in the saturation regime, i.e., for Q2 \u226a Q2s (A), and compare with the corresponding result in the linear regime at high Q2 , Eq. (2.31). By using (2.43) in\nEqs.

Dipole-hadron scattering at high energy\nAlthough the previous definition of the gluon distribution in terms of\nthe Fock space gluon density is useful for a conceptual discussion of\nsaturation, it is on the other hand less clear whether it corresponds to\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\n21:22\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Review Volume\n\nQGP3 \u0307final \u0307web\n\n31\n\nThe Color Glass Condensate and High Energy Scattering in QCD\n\nsomething that could be directly measured in experiments. Recall that,\nin the lowest-order analysis of deep inelastic scattering where one neglects non-linear effects in the hadron wavefunction, the gluon distribution is related to the scaling violation in the hadron structure function\nF2 : \u2202F2 /\u2202 ln Q2 \u221d \u03b1s xG(x, Q2 ). It is therefore interesting to compute\nthis quantity also in the presence of non-linear effects, and identify some\nmeasurable consequences of saturation. This is what we shall do starting with this section, first in the framework of the MV model, then by\nincluding the effects of the quantum evolution in going towards smaller\nvalues of x (in Sects. 3 and 4). As a general conclusion, we shall find\nthat saturation effects in the hadron wavefunction correspond to unitarity effects in the high-energy virtual-photon\u2013hadron collision, whose\ntotal cross-section is related to F2 via:\n\u03c3\u03b3 \u2217 H (x, Q2 ) =\n\n4\u03c0 2 \u03b1em\nF2 (x, Q2 ) .\nQ2\n\n(2.46)\n\nAs we have seen in Sect. 1.5, when viewed in the infinite momentum\nframe (IMF) of the hadron, DIS appears as the scattering of the virtual\nphoton off a quark (with longitudinal fraction equal to the Bjorken x of\nthe collision) in the hadron wavefunction. At very small x, this quark is\ntypically not a valence quark, but rather a see quark which is emitted,\nmost probably, off the small-x gluons. It is then convenient to disentangle\nthis final quark emission from the quantum evolution which involves\nmostly gluons. This can be done by performing a Lorentz boost in such\na way to pull the \u03b3 \u2217 q q\u0304 vertex out of the hadron. That is, instead of the\nhadron IMF, it is preferable to use the so-called dipole frame 19 (and\nreferences therein) in which most of the energy is still carried by the\nhadron (so that the high density effects are again associated with the\nhadron wavefunction), but the virtual photon moves in the negative z (or\npositive x\u2212 ) direction with enough energy to dissociate before scattering\ninto a quark\u2013antiquark pair in a color singlet state (a color dipole), which\nthen scatters off the hadron. This sequential picture of DIS is appropriate\nat high energy, since the lifetime of the q q\u0304 pair is much larger than the\ninteraction time between this pair and the hadron.\nMore precisely, if \u03c4 \u2261 ln(1/x) = yH \u2212 y\u03b3 \u2217 is the (boost-invariant)\nrapidity gap, with \u03c4 \u226b 1 at small x, then the dipole frame corresponds\nto choosing y\u03b3 \u2217 \u226a yH and such that \u03b1s y\u03b3 \u2217 \u226a 1, which ensures that one\ncan neglect additional gluon radiation from the quark and the antiquark\nin the dipole.\nThis physical picture translates into the following factorization formula for \u03c3\u03b3 \u2217 H 57,58,59 , that we shall derive in Sect. 4.1:\nZ 1 Z\n\u03c3\u03b3 \u2217 H (\u03c4, Q2 ) =\ndz d2 r\u22a5 |\u03a8(z, r\u22a5 ; Q2 )|2 \u03c3dipole (\u03c4, r\u22a5 ).\n(2.47)\n0\n\nHere, \u03a8(z, r\u22a5 ; Q2 ) is the light-cone wavefunction for the photon splitting into a q q\u0304 pair with transverse size r\u22a5 and a fraction z of the pho-\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\n32\n\n21:22\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Review Volume\n\nQGP3 \u0307final \u0307web\n\nThe Color Glass Condensate and High Energy Scattering in QCD\n\nton's longitudinal momentum carried by the quark57,58 . Furthermore,\n\u03c3dipole (\u03c4, r\u22a5 ) is the dipole\u2013hadron total cross section for a dipole of\ntransverse size r\u22a5 = x\u22a5 \u2212 y\u22a5 (with the quark located at x\u22a5 and the\nantiquark at y\u22a5 ), and is obtained by integrating the (imaginary part) of\nthe scattering amplitude N\u03c4 (x\u22a5 , y\u22a5 ) = N\u03c4 (r\u22a5 , b\u22a5 ) over all the impact\nparameters b\u22a5 = (x\u22a5 + y\u22a5 )/2 :\nZ\n\u03c3dipole (\u03c4, r\u22a5 ) = 2 d2 b\u22a5 N\u03c4 (r\u22a5 , b\u22a5 ) .\n(2.48)\nAt high energy, the dipole-hadron scattering can be treated in the eikonal\napproximation57,60,52 . This amounts to neglecting the recoil of the\nquark (or the antiquark) during its scattering off the color field in the\ntarget: the whole effect of the scattering consists in a color precession.\nThen, the scattering amplitude reads N\u03c4 (x\u22a5 , y\u22a5 ) = 1\u2212S\u03c4 (x\u22a5 , y\u22a5 ), with\nthe following S-matrix element:\n\u0011E\n1 D \u0010 \u2020\nS\u03c4 (x\u22a5 , y\u22a5 ) \u2261\ntr V (x\u22a5 )V (y\u22a5 )\n,\n(2.49)\nNc\n\u03c4\n\nwhere V \u2020 and V are the Wilson lines describing the eikonal interaction\nbetween the quark (or the antiquark) and the color field at rapidity \u03c4\ndue to color sources within the hadron:\n\u0012 Z \u221e\n\u0013\n\u2212\na\nV \u2020 (x\u22a5 ) = P exp ig\ndx\u2212 A+\n.\n(2.50)\na (x , x\u22a5 )t\n\u2212\u221e\n\nThat is, this is the same as Eq. (2.24), but rewritten in the fundamental\nrepresentation. The average in Eq. (2.49) is over all the configurations of\nthe color fields in the hadron. In the CGC formalism, where A+\na = \u03b1a ,\ncf. Eq. (2.17), this average is computed as in Eq. (2.22).\nIn what follows we shall focus on the computation of the S-matrix\nelement (2.49), which encodes all the information about the hadronic\nscattering, and thus about the non-linear and quantum effects in the\nhadron wavefunction. [Once this is known, F2 can be immediately obtained by using Eqs.

(2.52), which would predict a scattering ampli2\ntude growing indefinitely with the area r\u22a5\nspanned by the dipole, and\nalso with the atomic number A of the target. Eq. (2.51) shows that,\nwhen r\u22a5 and/or A are large enough, the effects of multiple scattering\nbecome non-negligible, and eventually ensure the unitarization of the\nscattering amplitude at fixed impact parameterc . Note that, according\nto Eq. (2.51), the multiple scatterings are higher-twist effects, i.e., their\n2\ncontributions are of higher order in r\u22a5\n.\nWe see that, remarkably, it is the same scale - the saturation momentum - which sets the critical transverse size for both gluon saturation and the unitarization of the dipole-hadron scattering. This conclusion, that we have found here in the framework of the MV model, will\nbe seen in Sect. 3 to remain valid after including the quantum evolution.\nPhysically, this can be understood as follows: Both saturation and unitarization (when the scattering is seen in the dipole frame)\nrequire strong\nR\ncolor fields in the hadron wavefunction, such that g dx\u2212 A+ \u223c 1. Qs\nis the critical transverse scale at which this strong field condition begins\nto be satisfied.\nWhat is specific to the present MV model (and, more generally, to\nany approximation in which the color sources are only weakly correlated\nwith each other, like the gluonic sources in the DGLAP approximation\n10,12 ) is that the dipole scatters independently off the color sources in\nthe hadron (here, the valence quarks). This is best seen by noticing that\nEq.

As a result, not only the general Glauber formula (2.53) becomes\ninapplicable (the successive scatterings are not independent any longer),\nbut even its linearized 'leading-twist' approximation, corresponding to\na single scattering, fails to apply when 1/r\u22a5 is close enough to Qs ,\nwhile still above it. This is the BFKL regime where 'higher-twists' effects\nappear already in the linear evolution.\nMost interestingly, we shall see that gluon saturation at small x holds\nindependently of the non-linear effects in the classical Yang-Mills equations. Rather, this is the consequence of the correlations among the color\nsources induced by non-linear effects in the quantum evolution. These\nsame correlations will be shown to ensure color screening already over the\nperturbative scale 1/Qs \u226a 1/\u039bQCD , which thus eliminates the infrared\nsensitivity of the classical MV model to the non-perturbative physics of\nconfinement (see, e.g., Eqs. (2.39) or (2.51)).\n3. The Quantum Evolution of the Color Glass Condensate\nIn this section, we shall explain how to construct the CGC effective\ntheory at small x by integrating out the gluons with x\u2032 > x in perturbation theory, in the presence of high density effects. The central result\nof this analysis will be a renormalization group equation for the weight\nfunction W\u039b+ [\u03c1] in Eq. (2.7), which generalizes the BFKL equation by\nincluding non-linear effects, and has important physical consequences\namong which gluon saturation.\n3.1. The BFKL evolution and its small-x problem\nWithin perturbative QCD, the enhancement of the gluon distribution at\nsmall x proceeds via the gluon cascades depicted in Fig. 10. Fig. 10.a\nshows the direct emission of a soft gluon with longitudinal momentum\nk+ = xP + \u226a P + by a fast moving parton (say, a valence quark) with\np+ = x0 P + and 1 > x0 \u226b x.

This correction is enhanced\nby the large rapidity interval \u2206\u03c4 = ln(x0 /x) available for the emission\nof the additional gluon.\nd At\n\nthe same level of accuracy, a complete calculation must include also the appropriate virtual corrections (self-energy and vertex renormalization); but for the present,\nqualitative purposes, it is sufficient to consider the real gluon emission.\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\n21:22\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Review Volume\n\nQGP3 \u0307final \u0307web\n\n35\n\nThe Color Glass Condensate and High Energy Scattering in QCD\np+\np +1\n\n1\n\np+\n\np+\n\np +1\nk+ << p +\nk+\n\np 2+\n\n2\n.\n\n.\n.\n\np+\n\nn\n\nn\n\nk+\na)\n\nb)\n\nc)\n\nFig. 10. a) Small\u2013x gluon emission by a fast parton; b) the lowest-order radiative correction; c) a gluon cascade.\n\nA similar enhancement holds for the gluon cascade in Fig. 10.c, in\nwhich the succesive gluons are strongly ordered in longitudinal momenta:\n+\n+\n+\np+ \u226b p+\n1 \u226b p2 \u226b * * * \u226b pn \u226b k .

Clearly, when x is so\nsmall that ln(x0 /x) \u223c 1/\u1fb1s , all such quantum \"corrections\" become of\norder one, and must be resummed for consistency. A calculation which\nincludes effects of order (\u03b1s ln(1/x))n to all orders in n is said to be valid\nto \"leading logarithmic accuracy\" (LLA).\nThe gluon cascades in Fig. 10 contribute all to the production of\n(virtual) gluons with longitudinal fraction x. Thus, by resumming these\ncascades, one can compute the number of such gluons per unit rapidity,\ni.e., the gluon distribution (2.25). One can recognize in Eqs. (3.1)\u2013(3.2)\nthe expansion of an exponential. Therefore:\n\ndN\n\u2261 xG(x, Q2 ) \u223c e\u03c9\u1fb1s \u03c4 = x\u2212\u03c9\u1fb1s ,\n(3.3)\nd\u03c4\nwith \u03c9 a pure number. We have tacitly assumed that all the gluons in\nthe cascade have transverse momenta of the same order, namely of order\nQ. A more refined treatment, based on the BFKL equation 8 , allows one\nto compute \u03c9 and specifies the Q2 \u2013dependence, and also the subleading\n\u03c4 \u2013dependence (beyond the exponential behaviour shown in Eq. (3.3)) of\nthe gluon distribution.\nTo describe the effects of the BFKL evolution in more detail, it is\ninstructive to consider the dipole-hadron scattering introduced in Sect.\n2.7. With increasing energy, the gluon fields change in the hadron wavefunction, and therefore so does also the cross-section for the dipole which\ncouples to these fields (cf. Eq. (2.49)). Specifically, to LLA, and in the\nlinear regime where one can neglect multiple scattering, the amplitude\nN\u03c4 (x\u22a5 , y\u22a5 ) = 1 \u2212 S\u03c4 (x\u22a5 , y\u22a5 ) \u2261 Nxy obeys to:\nZ 2\nn\no\n\u2202\n(x\u22a5 \u2212 y\u22a5 )2\nd z\u22a5\nNxz + Nzy \u2212 Nxy ,\n(3.4)\nNxy = \u1fb1s\n\u2202\u03c4\n2\u03c0 (x\u22a5 \u2212 z\u22a5 )2 (y\u22a5 \u2212 z\u22a5 )2\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\n36\n\n21:22\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Review Volume\n\nQGP3 \u0307final \u0307web\n\nThe Color Glass Condensate and High Energy Scattering in QCD\n\nwhich is the coordinate form of the BFKL equation 8,48 .\n\nfast partons (\u03c1)\n\nFast hadron\n\nsmall-x gluons (A[\u03c1])\nDipole\n\n\u03b3\u2217\nFig. 11.\n\nDeep inelastic scattering in the dipole frame\n\nThe physical interpretation of this equation depends upon the\nLorentz frame that we choose to visualize the process. When using the\ndipole frame of Sect. 2.7, the quantum evolution is put entirely in the\nwavefunction of the hadron (which is boosted to higher and higher energies with increasing \u03c4 ), while the dipole remains a simple q q\u0304 pair. In this\nframe, Eq. (3.4) describes the dipole-hadron scattering as the exchange\nof a BFKL ladder; the dipole couples to the last gluon (with the smallest\nvalue of x) in a gluon cascade which develops fully inside the hadron.\n(See also Fig. 11.)\nAlternatively, by a change of frame, one can use the increase in the\ntotal energy to accelerate the dipole, and study the evolution of its wavefunction with \u03c4 . Under an increment d\u03c4 such that \u1fb1s d\u03c4 \u223c 1, the dipole\nevolves by emitting one gluon (from either the quark or the antiquark),\nand the ensuing q q\u0304g state scatters off the hadronic target. It is convenient (although not necessary) to view this evolved state in the large\u2013Nc\nlimit, in which the radiated gluon is effectively replaced by a q q\u0304 pair in\na color octet state. Then, the evolution looks like the splitting of the\noriginal dipole into two new dipoles, each of them made of a quark (or\nantiquark) from the initial dipole and an antiquark (or a quark) from\nthe emitted gluon. From this perspective, the various terms in Eq. (3.4)\nhave a simple interpretation: the quantity\n\u1fb1s\n(x\u22a5 \u2212 y\u22a5 )2\n2\u03c0 (x\u22a5 \u2212 z\u22a5 )2 (y\u22a5 \u2212 z\u22a5 )2\n\n(3.5)\n\nis the differential probability for the initial dipole (x\u22a5 , y\u22a5 ) to decay\ninto a pair of dipoles (x\u22a5 , z\u22a5 ) and (x\u22a5 , z\u22a5 ), while Nxz and Nzy are\nthe amplitudes for the scattering between any one of these final dipoles\nand the target. Finally, the negative contribution proportional to \u2212Nxy\nrepresents the decrease in the scattering amplitude of the original dipole\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\n21:22\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Review Volume\n\nQGP3 \u0307final \u0307web\n\nThe Color Glass Condensate and High Energy Scattering in QCD\n\n37\n\ndue to its dissociation (this term is necessary for the conservation of the\nprobability).\nOne should mention here that this different perspective, in which the\nquantum evolution is put in the dipole and studied in the large-Nc limit,\nlies at the basis of an approach originally developed by Mueller 48 - the\n'Color Dipole approach' -, in which the wave function of a very energetic\ncolor dipole (an \"onium\") is constructed in the BFKL approximation.\nIn this approach, the scattering between two \"onia\" (physically, this\ncorresponds, e.g., to the \u03b3 \u2217 \u03b3 \u2217 scattering) can be treated as the product\nof the number of dipoles in each onium times the dipole-dipole crosssection. The ensuing scattering amplitude has been shown to satisfy\nequation (3.4).\nThe BFKL equation (3.4) can be solved by standard techniques 9 .\n2 2\nAt high energy, \u1fb1s \u03c4 \u226b ln(1/r\u22a5\n\u039bQCD ), and for a homogeneous target\n(e.g., for a large nucleus, and impact parameters near the center of the\ntarget), the solution reads (with r\u22a5 = x\u22a5 \u2212 y\u22a5 )\n\u0010\n\u0011\uf8fc\n\uf8f1\n2\n2 2 \uf8fd\nq\n\uf8f2\n\u03c9 \u1fb1s \u03c4\n\u2212\nln\nr\nQ\n0\n\u22a5\n2 Q 2 \u221ae\nN\u03c4 (r\u22a5 ) \u2243 r\u22a5\nexp\n.\n(3.6)\n0\n\uf8f3\n\uf8fe\n2\u03b2 \u1fb1s \u03c4\n2\u03c0\u03b2 \u1fb1s \u03c4\nwhere the reference scale Q0 is introduced by the initial conditions at\nlow energy, and thus is of order \u039bQCD (for a nucleus, this carries the\ndependence on A). Furthermore, \u03c9 = 4 ln 2 \u2248 2.77 and \u03b2 = 28\u03b6(3) \u2248\n33.67. In writing Eq. (3.6) we have assumed a fixed coupling \u03b1s , as\nappropriate at leading-order BFKL accuracy. The modifications due to\nthe running of the coupling will be discussed in Sect. ??.\nEq. (3.6) exhibits two essential features of the BFKL approximation,\nwhich eventually provoke its failure in the high energy limit :\n(a) Violation of the unitarity bound : The solution (3.6) increases\nexponentially with \u03c4 , that is, as a power of the energy. At high energy,\nsuch a behaviour violates both the unitarity bound N\u03c4 (r\u22a5 , b\u22a5 ) \u2264 1 on\nthe scattering amplitude at fixed impact parameter, and the Froissart\nbound \u03c3dipole (s) \u2264 \u03c30 ln2 s 4 on the total dipole cross-section (2.48).\n\u0010\n\u0011\n2 2\n(b) Infrared diffusion : When seen as a function of ln r\u22a5\nQ0 , the\n\nsolution (3.6) shows a diffusive behaviour, with diffusion 'time' proportional to \u03c4 . With increasing energy, the typical transverse momenta carried by the gluons within the BFKL ladder diffuse away from the hard ex2\nternal scale 1/r\u22a5\n\u226b \u039b2QCD , and eventually enters the non-perturbative\n2 < 2\nregion at k\u22a5 \u223c \u039bQCD , which contradicts the use of perturbation theory.\nThe first difficulty is similar to that with the linear approximation\nto the scattering amplitude in the MV model, Eq. (2.52), which violates\nunitaritye for very large A. As in that case, we expect unitarity to be\n\ne We\n\nmean here the unitarity of the scattering amplitude at fixed impact parameter.

(2.49)\u2013(2.50). Both Eqs. (2.52) and\n(3.6) correspond to a single scattering approximation\u2013they are obtained\nby retaining terms which are, at most, quadratic in gA+ in the expansion\nof the Wilson lines in Eq. (2.49).)\nHowever, unlike in the MV model, at small x we expect an additional\nsource of non-linearities which arise from the interactions among the gluonic sources. Such interactions lead to the fusion of gluons from different\nparton cascades (\"gluon recombination\"), a phenomenon which should\ntame the rapid growth of the number of partons. Thus saturation arises\nfrom the competition of two effects: the growth of the gluonic density\ndue to radiation and its depletion due to recombination effects 11,12 .\nSince now the dominant color sources are themselves gluons, the saturation we speak of here refers simultaneously to the source and the fields\nradiated by them. This is because what we call \"sources\" and \"radiated\nfields\" is only relative, as it depends upon the scale \u039b+ = xP + at which\nwe consider the effective theory.\nBoth the multiple scattering and gluon recombination mechanisms\nare illustrated in Fig. 11. We expect both mechanisms to become important at the same scale, Q2s (\u03c4, A), which is the critical gluon density at\nwhich the non-linear effects become of order one. This saturation scale\nis also the typical transverse momentum of the gluons in the hadron\nwavefunction at small x. As anticipated in the Introduction, and will\nbe verified explicitly in what follows, this scale increases rapidly with \u03c4\nand A. The emergence of such a hard intrinsic momentum scale can also\nsolve the 'infrared diffusion' problem of the BFKL approximation and\ntherefore restore the applicability of perturbation theory to high energy\nprocesses in QCD.\nIn the dipole frame, gluon recombination is seen as the merging of\ntwo gluon cascades, as illustrated in the r.h.s. of Fig. 11. It is interesting\nto see this process also from the boosted frame in which the quantum\nevolution proceeds via the dissociation of the incoming dipole into two\ndipoles. After the boost, the final gluon in the cascade in Fig. 11-the\none which couples to the dipole-gets incorporated within the dipole\nwavefunction, so the merging of two cascades now happens inside the\ndipole. Thus, from the boosted frame, the non-linear process is seen\nas the simultaneous scattering of the two final dipoles off the hadronic\ntarget.\nThese considerations suggest the following simple equation which\ngeneralizes Eq.

The main assumption used in its derivation was\nthe fact the two final dipoles scatter independently off the target; it is\ncorrect only in the large\u2013Nc limit. Deriving this equation, (together with\nits generalizations to finite Nc originally obtained by Balitsky 52 within\na different formalism) within the framework of the CGC effective theory,\nwill be a main objective of the forthcoming developments in this section.\n3.2. Non-linear evolution for the CGC\nThe CGC provides a natural framework for the description of the nonlinear effects in the quantum evolution towards small x, and of the\nphenomenon of saturation. The main observation is that, to LLA, all\nthe quantum corrections described previously-both the exponentially\ndeveloping BFKL cascade, and gluon recombination which tames this\nrapid growth-can be incorporated into a change of the classical color\ncharge and its correlations, namely, into a renormalization of the weight\nfunction W\u039b+ [\u03c1] in Eq. (2.7).\nTo see this at an intuitive level, let us reconsider the first radiative\ncorrection, the one\u2013gluon emission in Fig. 10.b, and note that, to LLA,\nthe typical contributions to the integral in Eq. (3.1) come from momenta\n+\n+\n+\np+\n1 such that p \u226b p1 \u226b k . That is, the condition of separation of\nscales is indeed satisfied for the intermediate gluon with momentum p+\n1\nto be treated as a 'frozen' color source for the final gluon with momentum\n+\nk . The effect of this quantum correction is therefore simply to renormalize the effective color source at scale k+ , as pictorially illustrated in\nFig. 12.\n1111\n0000\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n\u03c1\n0000\n1111\n0000\n1111\n\np+\n\np+\n\np+\n1\n\n+\nk+\n\nFig. 12.\n\n=\nk+\n\nk+\n\nEffective color source after including the lowest-order radiative correction.\n\nBy iterating this argument, it is quite clear that a whole BFKL\ncascade (see Fig. 10.c) can be included in the definition of the classical\ncolor source at the scale \u039b+ = xP + of interest. It is furthermore clear\nthat the fusion between two gluon cascades, as illustrated in the l.h.s.\nof Fig. 13, can be represented in the CGC theory as a non-linear effect\nin the classical dynamics of the color fields generated by this effective\nsource (see the r.h.s. of Fig. 13).\nBut non-linear effects are important also in the quantum evolution,\nand actually interfere with it, as illustrated in Fig. 14.

At each step in this procedure, one has to perform a one-loop\nquantum calculation, but with the exact background field propagator\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\n21:22\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Review Volume\n\nQGP3 \u0307final \u0307web\n\nThe Color Glass Condensate and High Energy Scattering in QCD\n\n41\n\nfor the \"semi-fast\" gluons (the quantum gluons that are integrated out\nin that particular step). Such an all-order inclusion of the classical field\neffects permits one to resum not only the large energy logarithms, namely\nthe terms \u223c (\u03b1s ln 1/x)n , but also the dominant high density effects\u2013 the\nnon-linear effects (like gluon recombination) which become of order one\nat saturation.\nThe corresponding analysis is technically quite involved and has been\ndescribed in detail in previous publications 23,20 . Here we shall present\nonly the final results and their consequences. As shown in Ref. 23 , the\ncondition that the new correlations induced by integrating out quantum fluctuations be reproduced by the CGC effective theory leads to a\nfunctional renormalization group equation (RGE) for the weight function\nW\u039b+ [\u03c1] \u2261 W\u03c4 [\u03c1], which is most succinctly written as 23\nZ\n\u2202W\u03c4 [\u03c1]\n1\n\u03b4\n\u03b4\nW\u03c4 [\u03c1] ,\n(3.8)\n=\n\u03c7 (x , y )[\u03c1] b\n\u2202\u03c4\n2 x\u22a5 ,y\u22a5 \u03b4\u03c1a\u03c4 (x\u22a5 ) ab \u22a5 \u22a5\n\u03b4\u03c1\u03c4 (y\u22a5 )\n\nin notations that we shall shortly explain. Early versions of this equation\ncan be found in the pioneering works of Refs. 22,54 . A formally similar,\nand physically equivalent 63 , functional evolution equation has been obtained by Weigert 55 , within a different formalism 52 . We shall discuss\nthis latter approach in the next subsection.\nLet us now discuss the meaning and structure of the terms in\nEq. (3.8). The rapidity variable \u03c4 = ln(1/x) = ln(P + /\u039b+ ) indicates\nthe dependence of the effective theory upon the separation scale. This is\nconvenient since (as illustrated by the BFKL evolution discussed in Sect.\n3.1), \u03c4 is the natural \"evolution time\". The contribution of the quantum\nmodes within a small layer in p+ (say \u039b+ > p+ > k+ ) is proportional\nto the rapidity extent \u2206\u03c4 = ln(\u039b+ /k+ ) of that layer.\nThe kernel \u03c7[\u03c1] is a positive definite non\u2013linear functional of \u03c1\n(Eq. (3.8) is a diffusion equation) and is highly non\u2013local in both longitudinal and transverse coordinates. The non\u2013linearity in \u03c1 and the non\u2013\nlocality in x\u2212 are strongly correlated, since they have a common origin:\n\u03c7[\u03c1] depends upon \u03c1 via the Wilson lines (2.24). Physically, \u03c7[\u03c1]d\u03c4 is\nthe charge-charge correlator induced when integrating out quantum gluons within a rapidity interval d\u03c4 and in the presence of a classical color\ncharge distribution with density \u03c1a (~x) 23,20 . Technically, this is computed by evaluating the diagram in Fig. 14.c with the Feynman rules\nin Eq. (2.7). Note that, in addition to this real-gluon emission diagram,\nthere are also virtual (self-energy and vertex) corrections which must be\nsimilarly computed 22,23 . Such corrections are already included in the\nRGE (3.8), where they correspond to the functional derivative of the\nkernel \u03c7[\u03c1] 23 .\nThe argument \u03c1a\u03c4 (x\u22a5 ) of the functional derivatives in Eq. (3.8) denotes the color charge density \u03c1a (x\u2212 , x\u22a5 ) at x\u2212 = x\u2212\n\u03c4 . The color source\ngenerated by the quantum evolution up to rapidity \u03c4 has support within\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\n42\n\n21:22\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Review Volume\n\nQGP3 \u0307final \u0307web\n\nThe Color Glass Condensate and High Energy Scattering in QCD\n\u2212\n\u03c4\na limited interval in x\u2212 , namely at 0 < x\u2212 < x\u2212\n\u03c4 , with x\u03c4 \u221d e . The\nreason this is so follows from the uncertainty principle: since the classical\nsource at rapidity \u03c4 is obtained by integrating out quantum modes with\nlarge longitudinal momenta p+ \u226b \u039b+ \u2261 e\u2212\u03c4 P + , it must be localized\n\u2212\n+\nnear x\u2212 = 0, within a distance \u2206x\u2212 \u223c e\u03c4 x\u2212\n0 (with x0 \u2261 1/P ).\nHowever, eq. (3.8) shows that the correlation between the quantum\nevolution in \u03c4 and the longitudinal distribution of the resulting color\nsource is even stronger. When the rapidity is further increased, say from\n\u03c4 to \u03c4 + d\u03c4 , the additional contribution to the color source which is\ngenerated in this way has no overlap in x\u2212 with the original source at\nrapidity \u03c4 . Instead, this new contribution makes a new layer in x\u2212 , which\n\u2212\nis located between x\u2212\n\u03c4 and x\u03c4 +d\u03c4 . This is why the functional derivatives\nin eq. (3.8) involve just the color source \u03c1\u03c4 \u2261 \u03c1(x\u2212\n\u03c4 ) in this outermost\nlayer.\nThis correlation is most simply formulated if one uses the space\u2013time\nrapidity y,\n\ny \u2261 ln(x\u2212 /x\u2212\n0 ),\n\n+\nx\u2212\n0 \u2261 1/P ,\n\n\u2212\u221e < y < \u221e ,\n\n(3.9)\n\nto indicate the longitudinal coordinate of a field.

In particular, the color source created\nby the quantum evolution up to \u03c4 has support at space-time rapidities\ny \u2264 \u03c4 (in agreement with the simple argument based on the uncertainty\nprinciple). Formally:\nW\u03c4 [\u03c1] \u221d \u03b4\u03c4 [\u03c1] ,\n\n(3.12)\n\nwhere \u03b4\u03c4 [\u03c1] is a \u03b4\u2013functional enforcing that \u03c1y \u2261 0 for any y > \u03c4 . As we\nshall see, this constraint is important because the \u03c4 \u2013dependence of the\nobservables in the effective theory comes precisely from the upper limit\non the longitudinal support of \u03c1.

The transverse kernel in\nEq. (3.14) is similar to the 'dipole kernel' in the BFKL equation (3.4).\nTheir relation will be discussed in the next subsection.\nThe RGE in eq. (3.13) [or eq. (3.8)] has the structure of a Fokker\u2013\nPlanck equation. In the CGC formalism, the quantum evolution towards\nsmall x is a random walk in the space of Wilson lines 63 . The random\nprocess is one by which the Wilson lines are built. The physical random\nvariable in the evolution is the elementary contribution \u03b1a\u03c4 (x\u22a5 ) to the\nclassical field in the hadron arising from integrating out quantum fluctuations in the rapidity strip [\u03c4, \u03c4 + d\u03c4 ].

(This path\nis unambiguously defined only after discretizing the rapidity variable;\nsee Ref. 63 for details.) By exploiting this representation, an exact but\nformal solution to Eq.

Both involve some approximations.\nThe first strategy consists in using this functional equation to deduce\nordinary differential equations for quantities of interest. Because of the\nnon-linearity of Eq. (3.13), the ensuing equations will generally not be\nclosed, but rather form an infinite hierarchy of coupled equations. Nevertheless some progress can be made in various approximations, particularly in the large Nc limit, where we shall see that a closed equation\nemerges. The other strategy, to be developed in the next subsection, is\nto search directly for approximate solutions to the functional equation\n(3.13) for the weight function.\nIf hO[\u03b1] i\u03c4 is any observable which can be computed as an average\nover \u03b1 (cf. eq.

This is similar in spirit\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\n21:22\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Review Volume\n\nQGP3 \u0307final \u0307web\n\nThe Color Glass Condensate and High Energy Scattering in QCD\n\nto the 'Color Dipole approach' by Mueller 48 , but it is not restricted to\nthe large\u2013Nc limit. It is better suited for an asymmetric collision, like\nthat between an \"onium\" (= a high-energy dipole) and a dense hadronic\ntarget, like a nucleus. In this respect, Balitsky's formalism is closer to\nthe CGC formalism, where the focus is fully on the target wavefunction.\nAs anticipated, the above equation is not closed: It relates the 2point function to the 4-point function htr(Vx\u2020 Vz )tr(Vz\u2020 Vy )i. Physically, it\nis so since, except at large Nc , the q q\u0304g system formed after radiating one\ngluon from the original dipole is not exactly the same as a system of two\ndipoles (recall the discussion around Eq. (3.5)). One can similarly derive\nan evolution equation for the 4-point function 52 , but this will in turn\ncouple the 4-point function to a 6-point function, and so on. Eq. (3.20)\nis merely the first in an infinite hierarchy of coupled equations 52 . In\nRef. 55 , Weigert managed to reformulate Balitsky's hierarchy as a single\nfunctional evolution equation for the generating functional of the n-point\nfunctions of the Wilson lines. As shown in Ref. 63 , Weigert's equation\nis equivalent to the RGE (3.13) as far as the correlations of the Wilson\nlines are concerned. More recently, Mueller used a similar approach to\ngive a simple derivation 56 for Eq. (3.13).\nA closed equation can still be obtained in the large Nc limit in which\nthe 4-point function in eq. (3.20) factorizes:\nD\nE D\nE\nD\nE\nfor Nc \u2192 \u221e.\ntr(Vz\u2020 Vy )\ntr(Vx\u2020 Vz ) tr(Vz\u2020 Vy ) \u2212\u2192 tr(Vx\u2020 Vz )\n\u03c4\n\n\u03c4\n\n\u03c4\n\nThen Eq. (3.20) reduces to a closed equation for the 2-point function, which, when rewritten in terms of the scattering amplitude\nN\u03c4 (x\u22a5 , y\u22a5 ) = N1c htr(1 \u2212 Vx\u2020 Vy )i\u03c4 , is recognized as the Kovchegov equation (3.7) 53 . An early version of this equation has been proposed by\nGribov, Levin and Ryskin 11 , and proven by Mueller and Qiu 12 in the\n'double-logarithmic approximation'. More recently, Braun has rederived\nEq. (3.7) by directly resumming 'fan' diagrams 61 . Following the recent\nliterature, we shall refer to Eq. (3.7) as the \"Balitsky-Kovchegov (BK)\nequation\"\nClearly, in the weak scattering approximation N\u03c4 (r\u22a5 ) \u226a 1 (which\ncorresponds to a very small dipole, or, equivalently, to a relatively low\ngluon density in the hadronic target), the non-linear term can be neglected in the r.h.s. of Eq. (3.7), which then reduces to the BFKL equation (3.4). But in general, the feedback provided by this non-linear term\nensures that the solution N\u03c4 (r\u22a5 ) to Eq. (3.7) respects the unitarity\nbound N\u03c4 (r\u22a5 ) \u2264 1. Thus, Eq. (3.7) is a simple QCD\u2013based non-linear\nequation consistent with unitarity. This explains the large interest in this\nequation in the recent literature, with important progress towards its resolution via both analytic 53,65,46 and numerical methods 65,66,67,68 .\nThe conclusions reached in this approach are equivalent to those ob-\n\n45\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\n46\n\n21:22\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Review Volume\n\nQGP3 \u0307final \u0307web\n\nThe Color Glass Condensate and High Energy Scattering in QCD\n\ntained from direct investigations of the RGE (3.13) 16,69 , and will be\ndescribed in the next sections.\n3.4.

The scattering amplitude vanishes as r\u22a5 \u2192 0, as it should from its\ndefinition N\u03c4 (r\u22a5 ) = N1c htr(1 \u2212 Vx\u2020 Vy )i\u03c4 , and the fact that the Wilson\nlines are unitary matrices. For small r\u22a5 , N\u03c4 (r\u22a5 ) remains small (\"color\ntransparency\"), and is well approximated by the BFKL solution (3.6).\nFor large r\u22a5 , it approaches the unitarity bound N\u03c4 (r\u22a5 ) = 1. The transition between \"color transparency\" at small r\u22a5 and \"blackness\" at large\nr\u22a5 takes place at a characteristic value of r\u22a5 that we shall identify with\nthe saturation length 1/Qs (\u03c4 ). More precisely, we shall define Qs (\u03c4 ) by\nthe following convention:\nN\u03c4 (r\u22a5 ) = 1/2\n\nfor\n\nr\u22a5 = 1/Qs (\u03c4 ) .\n\n(3.21)\n\nAs shown in Fig. 15, this saturation length decreases with \u03c4 .\nThe result illustrated in Fig. 15 clearly shows that the non-linear BK\nequation (3.7) solves the unitarity problem of the BFKL equation (at\nleast, at a fixed impact parameter; see also Sect. 4.4 below). Moreover,\nthe emergence of an intrinsic \"saturation scale\" Qs (\u03c4 ), which increases\nwith \u03c4 , also solves the problem of \"infrared diffusion\", as convincingly\ndemonstrated by the numerical analysis in Ref. 68 . In addition to the\nnumerical studies in Refs. 65,66,67,68 , the behaviour shown in Fig. 15\nis supported also by analytic investigations focusing on qualitative features like the energy dependence of the saturation scale 15,46,94,44 ,\nthe \"geometric scaling\" behaviour 46,94,44 , or the approach towards\nthe blackness with increasing r\u22a5 53,65,16,46,69 .

Even though the\nBFKL solution (3.6) is valid only at small r\u22a5 , well below the saturation\nlength, it is nevertheless possible to compute the energy dependence of\nthe saturation scale by extrapolating Eq. (3.6) up to r\u22a5 \u223c 1/Qs (\u03c4 )\nand then imposing the saturation condition (3.21) 15,46 . More precisely,\nwe shall see shortly that Q2s (\u03c4 ) is increasing exponentially with \u03c4 . The\nBFKL computation alluded to above should then correctly reproduce the\nvalue of the exponent, but not necessarily the (slowly varying) prefactor\nas well (see however 94 ).\nTowards this end, the solution of the BFKL equation in Eq. (3.6) is\n2 2\nfirst re-written as (\u03c1 \u2261 ln(1/r\u22a5\nQ0 )):\n\u001a\n\u001b\n\u03c1\n\u03c12\nN\u03c4 (r\u22a5 ) \u2243 exp \u03c9 \u1fb1s \u03c4 \u2212 \u2212\n,\n(3.22)\n2\n2\u03b2 \u1fb1s \u03c4\nwhere we have kept only the dominant terms in the regime \u03c1 \u226b 1 and\n\u1fb1s \u03c4 \u226b 1, with \u1fb1s \u03c4 \u226b \u03c1. Since the BFKL equation is now seen as just an\napproximation to more general non-linear equations like the BK equation\n(3.7), the solution (3.22) is acceptable only as long as r\u22a5 \u226a 1/Qs (\u03c4 ), or\n\u03c1 > \u03c1s (\u03c4 ), with \u03c1s (\u03c4 ) \u2261 ln(Q2s (\u03c4 )/Q20 ).\nIf nevertheless extrapolated down to \u03c1 \u223c \u03c1s (\u03c4 ), the saturation condition (3.21) amounts to the vanishing of the exponent in Eq. (3.22).\nThis gives a second-order algebraic equation for \u03c1s (\u03c4 ) with the physical\nsolution 15,46 :\nh\ni\np\nQ2s (\u03c4 ) = Q20 ec\u1fb1s \u03c4 , c = \u2212 \u03b2 + \u03b2(\u03b2 + 8\u03c9) /2 = 4.84...\n(3.23)\n\nThis estimate is consistent with the numerical solutions to the BK equa65,66,68 , but not with the phenomenology\ntion, which have found c >\n\u223c4\nof DIS at HERA, which suggests rather a significantly lower value for the\nexponent 43 (see Sect. 4.3 below), namely, \u03bb \u2248 0.3 instead of c\u1fb1s \u223c 1.\nThe factor in front of the exponential in eq. (3.23) is not under\ncontrol in present approximations. In Ref. 94 , a more refined treatment\nwas proposed, where the BFKL equation was solved with an absorbtive\nboundary condition at r\u22a5 \u223c 1/Qs (\u03c4 ), and a weak dependence on \u03c4 for\nthis prefactor was obtained. It would be interesting to test their results\nagainst more accurate numerical solutions to Eq. (3.7).\nIt is also interesting to study the behaviour of the scattering amplitude (3.22) for r\u22a5 below but relatively close to 1/Qs (\u03c4 )\u2013for \u03c1 slightly\nabove \u03c1s (\u03c4 ).

Eq. (3.25) suggests a remarkable simplification: Assume that r\u22a5 is sufficiently close to 1/Qs (\u03c4 ) (although still\nbelow it) for \u03b4\u03c1/\u1fb1s \u03c4 \u226a 1.

Numerically,\nsuch a scaling behaviour has been seen in the solutions to the BK equation 65,68 .\nSince Eq. (3.26) is the first term in an expansion in powers of \u03b4\u03c1/\u03c1s ,\nwith \u03c1s = c\u1fb1s \u03c4 , this approximation is correct for\n1 < ln\n\n1\n\u226a c\u1fb1s \u03c4 .\n2 Q2 (\u03c4 )\nr\u22a5\ns\n\n(3.27)\n\nThe condition on the left, r\u22a5 < 1/Qs (\u03c4 ), ensures we are still in a linear\n2\nregime. For a dipole transverse resolution Q2 \u2261 1/r\u22a5\n, this condition\n46\ntranslates to the following scaling window :\nQ2s (\u03c4 ) \u226a Q2 \u226a\n\nQ4s (\u03c4 )\n.\nQ20\n\n(3.28)\n\nSince Q0 \u223c \u039bQCD and Qs (\u03c4 ) \u226b \u039bQCD for sufficiently large \u03c4 , the\nupper boundary of this scaling window is rather large. In particular,\nit is much larger than the saturation scale itself: Q2s (\u03c4 )/Q0 \u226b Qs (\u03c4 ).\nRemarkably, as a consequence of saturation, knowledge of an intrinsic\nmomentum scale is propagated through the linear evolution equations\nup to relatively large values of Q2 well outside the saturation regime.\nThis is especially interesting since such values of Q2 are large enough for\nperturbation theory to be fully trustworthy. A property like (3.26) can\nbe and has been tested against the experimental data 45,93,39 . We shall\nreturn to phenomenological aspects of geometric scaling in Sect. 4.3.\nThe previous results are obtained from the leading order BFKL equation. Recently, there has been some progress in including next-to-leadingorder \u03b1s effects in the physics of saturation. In Refs. 46,94 , this was done\nheuristically, by simply replacing the fixed coupling \u03b1s in the BFKL\nequation by the one-loop running coupling of QCD with the running\nscale set by the saturation momentum : \u1fb1s \u2212\u2192 \u1fb1s (Q2s (\u03c4 )), with\n\u1fb1s (Q2 ) =\n\nb0\n,\nln(Q2 /\u039b2QCD )\n\nb0 =\n\n12Nc\n.\n11Nc \u2212 2Nf\n\n(3.29)\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\n21:22\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Review Volume\n\nQGP3 \u0307final \u0307web\n\n49\n\nThe Color Glass Condensate and High Energy Scattering in QCD\n\nThe only modification due to the running coupling is in the functional\nform of the saturation scale, whose growth with \u03c4 becomes somewhat\nmilder (\u03c40 is an arbitrary constant, and c is the same number as in in\nEq. (3.23)):\n\u221a\nQ2s (\u03c4 ) = \u039b2QCD e 2b0 c(\u03c4 +\u03c40 ) ,\n(3.30)\nwhere the overall scale is now set by \u039bQCD rather than the initial scale\nQ0 . All the previous results on geometric scaling (the scaling law (3.26),\nincluding the value of the \"anomalous dimension\" \u03b3, and its range of\nvalidity (3.28)) remain unchanged, except for the expression for the saturation scale entering these results.\nFor nuclei, Eq. (3.30) has an intriguing consequence for the dependence of the saturation scale upon the atomic number A 95 . Assume an\ninitial condition of the MV type at \u03c4 = 0, Q2s (\u03c4 = 0, A) = Q2s (A) \u223c\nA1/3 ln A. For fixed coupling BFKL evolution, where Eq. (3.23) applies,\nthis initial condition identifies the hitherto unspecified 'initial' scale Q0\nwith the MV saturation scale,\nQ2s (\u03c4, A) = Q2s (A)ec\u1fb1s \u03c4\n\n(fixed coupling) ,\n\n(3.31)\n\nwhich preserves the A\u2013dependence of the initial condition at any later\n'time' \u03c4 : Q2s (\u03c4, A) \u223c A1/3 ln A.\nFor the running coupling BFKL evolution case where Eq. (3.30)\napplies (with \u03c40 fixed by the initial condition as 2b0 c\u03c40 =\n[ln(Q2s (A)/\u039b2QCD )]2 ), one obtains a very different A\u2013dependence at small\nand large \u03c4 , respectively 95 :\ni) At relatively small energies, such that \u03c4 \u226a \u03c40 \u223c ln2 A1/3 ,\n2\n\nQ2s (\u03c4, A) \u2248 Q2s (A) ec\u1fb1s (Qs (A))\u03c4 ,\n\n(3.32)\n\nwhich is the 'fixed-coupling'\u2013like behaviour, with the \u1fb1s in the exponent\nbeing the running coupling (3.29) evaluated at the initial saturation\nscale.\nii) At higher energies, \u03c4 \u226b ln2 A1/3 , one obtains\n\uf8f1\n!2 \uf8fc\n\uf8f2\n\uf8fd\n\u221a\n2\n1\nQ (A)\n\u221a\nQ2s (\u03c4, A) \u2248 \u039b2QCD e 2b0 c\u03c4 exp\n,\n(3.33)\nln 2s\n\uf8f3 2 2b0 c\u03c4\n\uf8fe\n\u039bQCD\nwhich, for very large \u03c4 , is nearly independent of A.\nIn Ref. 44 , which did not consider the A\u2013dependence, Triantafyllopoulos presented a complete computation of the NLO effects on the energy dependence of the saturation scale. Recall that the NLO corrections\nto the BFKL equation 96 , turn out to be anomalously large and require\nresummation to obtain sensible results. Ref. 44 used the RG\u2013improved\nresummation scheme of Ciafaloni, Colferai, and Salam 97 and found that,\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\n50\n\n21:22\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Review Volume\n\nQGP3 \u0307final \u0307web\n\nThe Color Glass Condensate and High Energy Scattering in QCD\n\nalthough Q2s (\u03c4 ) is in general a more complicated function than the simple\nexponential (3.23), it can nevertheless be represented as such for a rather\nwide range of rapidities (including those of phenomenological interest).\nSpecifically, if one defines \u03bb(\u03c4 ) \u2261 d ln(Q2s /\u039b2 )/d\u03c4 , then \u03bb(\u03c4 ) turns out\nto be a very slowly decreasing function, with \u03bb(\u03c4 = 5 \u2212 9) \u2243 0.30 \u2212 0.29.\nRemarkably, this value is also favoured by the current phenomenology at\nHERA 43 (and Sect. 4.3 below). It would be very interesting to compute\nthe A\u2013dependence within this fully NLO formalism.\n3.5. Gluon saturation and perturbative color neutrality\nIn this section, we return to the RGE (3.13), which describes the evolution of the hadron wavefunction as a whole, and construct approximate\nsolutions to it. As usual, these approximations depend upon the transverse resolution scale Q2 at which correlations are measured. If Q2 is\nlarge enough (Q2 \u226b Q2s (\u03c4 )), we probe color sources with small transverse size, which do not overlap with each other. In this dilute regime, a\ndescription in terms of uncorrelated sources, such as the MV model, may\nbe a good approximation. With increasing \u03c4 at fixed Q2 (or, equivalently,\nwith decreasing Q2 at fixed \u03c4 ), spatial correlations start to develop, initially according to the linear BFKL evolution and then, once the density\nis high enough, according to the general non-linear RGE which predicts\ngluon saturation. A schematic map of the kinematical regimes for quantum evolution is shown in Fig. 16 (see the discussion below for details).\ni) High\u2013momentum regime (Q2 \u226b Q2s ): Recovering BFKL\n\nIn the dilute regime at Q2 \u226b Q2s , the color charge density is low,\nhence the classical field is weak, g\u03b1 \u226a 1. One can therefore keep only the\nlinear term in the expansion of the Wilson lines in Eq. (3.13) in powers\nof g\u03b1 :\nZ\nV \u2020 (x\u22a5 ) \u2248 1 + ig dy \u03b1y (x\u22a5 ) \u2261 1 + ig\u03b1(x\u22a5 ),\n1 \u2212 Vz\u2020 Vx \u2248 ig(xj \u2212 xj )\u2202 j \u03b1(x\u22a5 ).\n\n(3.34)\n\n(\u03b1a (x\u22a5 ) is the effective color field in the transverse plane.) The kernel\n\u03b7[\u03b1] in Eq. (3.14) then becomes quadratic in \u03b1(x\u22a5 ), and the RGE takes\nthe generic form:\n\u0011 \u03b4\n\u2202W\u03c4 [\u03b1]\n1 \u03b4 \u0010\n\u03b1K\u03b1\n\u2248\nW\u03c4 [\u03b1] ,\n\u2202\u03c4\n2 \u03b4\u03b1\n\u03b4\u03b1\n\n(3.35)\n\nwhere the new kernel K is non-local in the transverse coordinates. Its\nexplicit form is easily extracted from Eq. (3.14) using Eq. (3.34). Even in\nthis dilute regime, the RGE is non-linear and the corresponding weight\nfunction W\u03c4 [\u03b1] is not a Gaussian.

Indeed, the quartic operator acting on\nW\u03c4 [\u03b1] in the r.h.s. of Eq.

This shows the expected rapid\nexponential growth with \u03c4 and infrared diffusion as well.\nii) Low\u2013momentum regime (Q2 \u226a Q2s ) : Saturation\n\nAn external probe with low transverse resolution Q2 \u226a Q2s couples\nmostly to the saturated gluons, which have momenta k\u22a5 <\n\u223c Qs and occupation numbers \u223c 1/\u03b1s . The corresponds classical fields are strong,\ng\u03b1(x\u22a5 ) \u223c 1, so the Wilson lines (3.11)-which are complex exponentials\nbuilt with these fields-oscillate around zero over a characteristic distance \u223c 1/Qs (\u03c4 ) in the transverse plane. This implies that Wilson lines\nwhich are separated by large distances \u226b 1/Qs (\u03c4 ) are necessarily uncorrelated (since their relative phases are random). Thus, when studying the\ndynamics over large transverse separations r\u22a5 \u226b 1/Qs (\u03c4 ), it should be\na good approximation to neglect the correlations of the Wilson lines (or,\nmore generally, to treat them as small quantities). This is the \"random\nphase approximation\" (RPA) introduced in Refs. 16,55 .\nIn this approximation, the RGE (3.8) simplifies drastically 16 .

It is to be used only for modes k\u22a5 < Qs (y).\nWe see an interesting duality emerging at saturation: this strong field\nregime allows for a description in terms of a Gaussian weight function,\nlike for a free theory.

(3.41) applies only for y in the interval \u03c4s (k\u22a5 ) < y < \u03c4 , with \u03c4s (k\u22a5 )\nbeing the rapidity at which the saturation scale becomes equal to the\nmomentum k\u22a5 of interest :\n2\nQ2s (\u03c4 ) = k\u22a5\n\nfor\n\n\u03c4 = \u03c4s (k\u22a5 ),\n\n(3.42)\n\n(see Fig. 16).

This should be contrasted with the exponential increase of the corresponding quantity at\nk\u22a5 \u226b Qs (\u03c4 ), obtained from the BFKL equation (3.38). (In Ref. 98 , the\nresult in Eq. (3.43) was obtained from a study of the BK equation.)\nWe conclude that, at low momenta k\u22a5 \u226a Qs (\u03c4 ), the color charge\ndensity saturates, because of the non\u2013linear effects in the quantum evolution 16 . In contras, in the MV model, the corresponding quantity \u03bc2A\nincreases indefinitely as a power of the atomic number A (the analog of\nthe energy in the MV model), since the respective sources are uncorrelated. Due to the quantum evolution, correlations arise already in the\nlinear regime via the BFKL equation. However it is only after including the non-linear effects associated with gluon recombination that these\ncorrelations are such as to limit the growth of the color charge density\nwith \u03c4 .\nSince the color sources saturate with \u03c4 , so does also the gluon distribution radiated by these sources. This is obvious if the linear approximationf , Eq. (3.37), is used to compute this distribution. Namely,\nEqs.

(2.43)) only after fully taking into account the non-linear\neffects in the classical EOM (2.8). By contrast, in the quantum case, the\nnon-linear effects responsible for saturation have already been encoded\nin the distribution of the color sources. This is natural since, as noticed\nat the end of Sect. 2, the difference between \"sources\" and \"wee gluons\"\nis a matter of convention and depends upon the resolution scale in k+ .\nAs anticipated, the gluon occupation factor at saturation, Eq. (3.44), is\nparametrically of order 1/\u03b1s , as in the MV model.\ng Recall\n\nthat Eq. (3.23) corresponds to a fixed coupling \u03b1s . In the case of a running\ncoupling, where Eq.

(3.44) remains formally the same, but \u1fb1s in\nthe denominator must be understood as the running coupling (3.29) evaluated at Q2 =\nk\u22a5 Q s .\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\n21:22\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Review Volume\n\nQGP3 \u0307final \u0307web\n\n55\n\nThe Color Glass Condensate and High Energy Scattering in QCD\n\nTo conclude, the unintegrated gluon distribution predicted by the\nCGC effective theory is illustrated in Fig. 17, and looks qualitatively\nsimilar to that in the MV model, cf. Fig. 9. At large k\u22a5 \u226b Qs (\u03c4 ), the\ndistribution in Fig. 17 is given by the solution to the BFKL equation, cf.\nEqs. (3.37)\u2013(3.38), while at low k\u22a5 \u226a Qs (\u03c4 ), it is given by Eq. (3.44).\nThe saturation condition (3.21) can be also formulated in terms of the\nunintegrated gluon distribution as\n\u03c6\u03c4 (k\u22a5 ) \u223c\n\n1\n\u1fb1s\n\nfor\n\nk\u22a5 \u223c Qs (\u03c4 ) .\n\n(3.45)\n\nThis condition, together with BFKL evolution at higher momenta, implies that, for k\u22a5 within the scaling window (3.28), the unintegrated\ngluon distribution has a scaling form similar to Eq. (3.26) 69 :\n!\u03b3\nQ2s (\u03c4 )\n\u03ba\n.\n(3.46)\n\u03c6\u03c4 (k\u22a5 ) \u2243\n2\n\u1fb1s\nk\u22a5\nwhere \u03ba is a yet undetermined numerical prefactor. We see that the\nscaling property characteristic of saturation (cf. Eq. (3.44)) is preserved\nby the linear BFKL evolution up to a relatively large moemtum k\u22a5 \u223c\nQ2s (\u03c4 )/\u039bQCD (cf. Eq. (3.28)), which is well above the saturation scale.\nThis \"extended scaling\" region 46 where the gluon density is relatively\nlow, but takes the scaling form (3.46), is represented on the diagram in\nFig. 16.\niii) Color neutrality at saturation\n2\nThe vanishing of the charge-charge correlator (see (3.43)), as k\u22a5\nwhen k\u22a5 \u2192 0 has important consequences for the infrared behaviour of\nthe CGC effective theory. Consider, the calculation of the dipole-hadron\nS-matrix element. In the MV model, it was found to be logarithmically\ninfrared divergent, cf. Eqs. (2.38) or (2.51). If in Eq. (2.37) one replaces\nthe MV estimate for the charge correlator \u03bbA by the corresponding quantum expression, the ensuing integral over k\u22a5 becomes infrared finite,\ndue to Eq. (3.41). When computed in the quantum effective theory, the\ndipole scattering amplitude is infrared safe, and therefore insensitive to\nthe non-perturbative physics of confinement. A similar property holds\nfor other gauge-invariant quantities like the gluon distribution.\nFurthermore, the smooth infrared behaviour in Eq. (3.41) is responsible for k\u22a5 \u2013saturation in the gluon distribution. In what follows, we shall\nargue that this behaviour has a simple physical interpretation\u2013gluonic\ncolor sources are correlated over long distances to ensure that color neutrality is achieved over a transverse area of order 1/Q2s (\u03c4 ) 20,98,69 .\nConsider the total color charge Qa enclosed within a surface \u03a3, as\ngiven by Eq. (2.4) with \u2206S\u22a5 \u2192 \u03a3.

(3.47) can\nbe estimated as (up to a color factor):\n2\nhQ2 i\u03c4 \u223c \u03a3 \u03bc2\u03c4 (k\u22a5\n\u223c 1/\u03a3) .\n\n(3.49)\n\u22121\n\nFor a relatively small area, or moderately high energies, \u03a3\n\u226b\nQ2s (\u03c4 ), and \u03bc2\u03c4 (k\u22a5 ) is given by the BFKL equation (3.38). Then\nEqs. (3.37) and (3.46) imply :\n\u0011\u03b3\n1 \u0010\nhQ2 i\u03c4 \u223c\n\u03a3Q2s (\u03c4 )\nfor\n1/\u03a3 \u226b Q2s (\u03c4 ),\n(3.50)\n\u03b1s\n\nwhich shows incomplete color shielding. With increasing \u03a3, the total\ncharge squared enclosed within this surface increases, but not as fast\nas the area itself. Thus, the density hQ2 i/\u03a3 \u223c 1/\u03a31\u2212\u03b3 vanishes in the\nlimit \u03a3 \u2192 \u221e, which is consistent with (global) charge conservation.\nFurthermore, for fixed \u03a3, the total charge hQ2 i\u03c4 increases exponentially\nwith \u03c4 .\nFor larger surfaces, of the order of the saturation disk 1/Q2s (\u03c4 ) or\nlarger, one should rather us eq. (3.43), which gives:\n\u0010\n\u0011\n1\nhQ2 i\u03c4 \u223c\nln \u03a3Q2s (\u03c4 )\nfor\n1/\u03a3 \u226a Q2s (\u03c4 ).\n(3.51)\n\u03b1s\nThe total charge squared (3.51) is still non-zero, but unlike Eq. (3.50)\nit is only logarithmically increasing with both 1/x and \u03a3. This is complete shielding : When increasing \u03a3, the newly included color sources are\ncompletely screened by the other sources. If the total charge (squared) is\nstill increasing with \u03a3 (albeit only slowly), it is because the longitudinal\nwidth \u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4s (\u03a3) \u223c ln(\u03a3Q2s (\u03c4 )) of the \"saturated\" piece of the hadron\nrises logarithmically with \u03a3.\nThis complete shielding, together with the fact that the total charge\n(3.51) is much smaller than the total charge for a system of uncorrelated color sources with surface density Q2s /\u03b1s , cf. eq. (3.48), enables\nus to speak about color neutrality already at the relatively short scale\n1/Qs (\u03c4 ) \u226a 1/\u039bQCD . This interpretation is further confirmed by the fact\nthat the color field created by gluon sources at large distances \u226b 1/Qs (\u03c4 )\ncannot be distinguished from a dipolar field 69 .\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\n21:22\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Review Volume\n\nQGP3 \u0307final \u0307web\n\nThe Color Glass Condensate and High Energy Scattering in QCD\n\n57\n\n3.6. A Gaussian effective theory\nConsider the calculation of the dipole-hadron S-matrix element (2.49)\nwithin the CGC effective theory. After expanding the Wilson lines\nin Eq. (2.49), one is led to evaluate n-point functions of the type\ng n h\u03b1(~z1 )\u03b1(~z2 ) * * * \u03b1(~zn )i\u03c4 , where the transverse arguments z\u22a5,i are either x\u22a5 or y\u22a5 . Each such a n-point function receives contributions from\neither hard (k\u22a5 > Qs (\u03c4 )) or semi-hardh (\u039bQCD < k\u22a5 < Qs (\u03c4 )) momenta. The contributions of the modes with k\u22a5 \u226a Qs (\u03c4 ) are easy to\nevaluate. In the saturation regime, the weight function is the Gaussian\n(3.40), and the only non-trivial correlation is the 2-point function (3.41).\nFor hard momenta k\u22a5 \u226b Qs (\u03c4 ), the weight function is strictly speaking\nnot a Gaussian. In this regime, fields are rather weak (g\u03b1 \u226a 1), so the\n(yet unknown) contributions of the higher-point correlations are less important than that of the 2-point function. The latter is explicitly known\nas the solution to the BFKL equation. Finally, there are the contributions of the modes k\u22a5 \u223c Qs (\u03c4 ), which we don't know how to evaluate\nso far. But these contributions should be relatively unimportant as long\nas x\u22a5 \u2212 y\u22a5 is either very small, or very large, compared to 1/Qs (\u03c4 ).\nTo summarize, in order to compute S\u03c4 (r\u22a5 ) for a dipole which is either\nvery large, or very small, it should be enough to use the previous approximations for the 2-point function, which are valid far away from the\nsaturation scale.\nThese considerations can be extended to any quantity which is not\nvery sensitive to the momenta in the transition regime around Qs (\u03c4 ). To\nsystematically compute such quantities, construct a Gaussian approximation to the weight function which encodes the limiting behavior of the\nthe 2-point function at high and low momenta and which interpolates\nsmoothly between these regimes. Such a Gaussian will be as simple to\nuse as the original MV model, but will extend the latter by including\nthe BFKL evolution at high momenta, and the physics of saturation and\ncolor neutrality at low momenta.\nSuch a Gaussian weight function has been constructed in Ref. 69 ,\nand reads:\n\u001a\n\u001b\nZ\nZ\n\u03c1ay (x\u22a5 )\u03c1ay (y\u22a5 )\n1 \u03c4\nW\u03c4 [\u03c1] = N\u03c4 exp \u2212\ndy\n,\n(3.52)\n2 \u2212\u221e\nx\u22a5 ,y\u22a5 \u03bby (x\u22a5 , y\u22a5 )\nwhere the kernel \u03bby (x\u22a5 , y\u22a5 ) - the 2-point function of the color sources\n(cf. Eq. (3.41)) - is such that its Fourier transform \u03bby (k\u22a5 ) satisfies the\nBFKL equation at momenta k\u22a5 \u226b Qs (\u03c4 ) and reduces to Eq. (3.41) for\nmomenta k\u22a5 \u226a Qs (\u03c4 ). We can match these limiting behaviours continuously at k\u22a5 = Qs (\u03c4 ) by imposing the following boundary condition on\nh As explained above, gauge invariant quantities computed in the effective theory are not\nsensitive to soft (k\u22a5 <\n\u223c \u039bQCD ) momenta.\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\n58\n\n21:22\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Review Volume\n\nQGP3 \u0307final \u0307web\n\nThe Color Glass Condensate and High Energy Scattering in QCD\n\nthe solution to the BFKL equation:\n1 2\nQ (\u03c4 ) \u2243 \u03bbBFKL\n(k\u22a5 = Qs (\u03c4 )) .\n\u03c4\n\u03c0 s\n\n(3.53)\n\nThen, the following function provides a smooth interpolation, that we\nshall use in Eq.

Deep Inelastic Scattering and the CGC\nIn this section, we shall discuss some applications of the Color Glass\nCondensate picture to Deep Inelastic Scattering. We start by explicitly\nderiving a factorization formula introduced in Sect. 2.7, which allows\none to compute the F2 structure function at high energy in terms of the\ndipole scattering. We shall then discuss a phenomenological \"saturation\nmodel\", proposed by Golec-Biernat and W\u00fcsthoff, which is based on\nsimilar physical premises, and compares remarably well with the HERA\ndata. This model will be further reconsidered from the CGC perspective,\nin which the dipole-hadron scattering is computed within QCD. This allows us to relate the \"geometric scaling\" observed in the HERA data\nto properties of the quantum evolution towards saturation. In addition,\nwe discuss the Froissart bound can be realized conceptually in the Color\nGlass Condensate. We discuss next the relation of saturation to shadowing in DIS. Finally, we discuss inclusive and semi-inclusive signatures of\nthe Color Glass Condensate in Deep Inelastic Scattering and specifically\nhow they may be observed at a future Electron Ion Collider.\n4.1. Structure Functions in the Color Glass Condensate\nWe shall show here how one computes structure functions for DIS in\nthe presence of non-linear effects associated with saturation 59 . Towards\nthis end, one needs the correlator of the electromagnetic current in the\nbackground of the strong classical gluon field representing the CGC.

In other\nwords, the Green's function which, in general, is computed in the full\nbackground field of the nucleus, is now computed in the saddle\u2013point\napproximation where Aa\u03bc \u2192 Aa\u03bc,classical . Note that this expression makes\nno reference to the operator product expansion of DIS 6 . Thus, it is also\n\nvalid at small values of x and moderate Q2 , where the operator product\nexpansion is not reliable 70 but where the classical approximation is\nsensible.\nSince the current-current correlator is gauge invariant, one can compute it by using background field propagator in an arbitrary gauge. For\nthe reasons explained in Sect. 2.4, it is most convenient to use the covariant gauge, in which the propagator reads as follows 71,52,59 :\nZ\nGA (x, y) = G0 (x \u2212 y) \u2212 i d4 z G0 (x \u2212 z)\u03b3 \u2212 \u03b4(z \u2212 )G0 (x \u2212 z)\nn\no\n\u03b8(x\u2212 )\u03b8(\u2212y \u2212 )(V \u2020 (z\u22a5 ) \u2212 1) \u2212 \u03b8(\u2212x\u2212 )\u03b8(y \u2212 )(V (z\u22a5 ) \u2212 1) ,\n(4.5)\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\n21:22\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Review Volume\n\nQGP3 \u0307final \u0307web\n\n61\n\nThe Color Glass Condensate and High Energy Scattering in QCD\n\nwhere G0 is the free propagator and V and V \u2020 are the Wilson lines of\nEq.

This decomposition implies a similar decomposition for F2 , namely, F2 = FT + FL . F1 ,\nthis is proportional to FT \u2013explicitly, FT = 2xF1 and the longitudinal\nstructure function is FL = F2 \u2212 2xF1 . In the parton model, FL = 0\u2013the\nCallan-Gross relation\u2013but is non-zero in QCD and is directly proportional to the gluon distribution. An independent measurement of FL is\ntherefore of great phenomenological interest as will be discussed in Sect.\n4.6. One can similarly derive expressions for the diffractive structure\nfunctions as discussed in Ref. 109 . Some of the phenomenological implications of the CGC picture for measurements of structure functions\nwere discussed in Sects. 2.6 and 2.7.\n4.2. The Golec-Biernat\u2013W\u00fcsthoff model\nIn Ref. 43 , Golec-Biernat and W\u00fcsthoff introduced a simple phenomenological model for the dipole-hadron cross-section, Eq. (2.48), which is\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\n62\n\n21:22\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Review Volume\n\nQGP3 \u0307final \u0307web\n\nThe Color Glass Condensate and High Energy Scattering in QCD\n\ngenerally referred to as the \"Saturation Model\" :\n\u0010\n\u0011\n2\n2\n\u03c3dipole (x, r\u22a5 ) = \u03c30 1 \u2212 e\u2212r\u22a5 Qs (x)/4\n\n(4.8)\n\nwith the parametrization Q2s (x) = Q20 (x0 /x)\u03bb . This shows color transparency at low r\u22a5 \u226a 1/Qs (x) and respects the unitarity bound, as it\napproaches a constant value \u03c30 when r\u22a5 \u226b 1/Qs (x). If one interpretes\n\u03c3dipole (x, r\u22a5 )/\u03c30 as a scattering amplitude (compare to Eq. (2.48)), then\nthis has no dependence upon the impact parameter b\u22a5 . Rather, this\nshould be seen as an average of the true scattering amplitude over all\nimpact parameters. This amplitude is consistent with the physics of saturation (compare to Fig. 15), so it is natural to interprete the scale\nQs (x) in Eq. (4.8) as a \"saturation momentum\". Note however that the\napproach towards the unitarity bound N\u03c4 (r\u22a5 ) = 1 for large r\u22a5 is much\nfaster then predicted by the CGC approach, or the solution to the BK\nequation (see Sect. 4.3 below). Besides, at small r\u22a5 , Eq. (4.8) fails to\nreproduce, as it should, the leading-twist approximation\u2013it misses the\n2 2\nlogarithmic factor ln (1/r\u22a5\n\u039b ) in the exponent of Eqs. (2.51). Neither\ndoes it recover the BFKL prediction (3.6).\nBy using the dipole cross-section (4.8) and the factorization formula\n(2.47) for DIS, Golec-Biernat and W\u00fcsthoff were able to fit the HERA\ndata for \u03c3\u03b3 \u2217 p for x < 10\u22122 and a wide range in Q2 with only three\nparameters, namely \u03c30 = 23 millibarns, \u03bb = 0.288 and x0 = 3.04 * 10\u22124 .\n(The reference scale Q20 has been fixed as Q20 = 1 GeV2 .) These fits\nwere performed for three light quark flavors; with the addition of charm\nquarks, the best fit was obtained with slightly changed parameters: \u03c30 =\n29.1mb, \u03bb = 0.277, and x0 = 0.4 * 10\u22124 .\nThe fits are reasonable for Q2 up to Q2 \u223c 20 GeV2 , but are less successful beyond. This is related to the above observation that Eq. (4.8)\ndoes not have the right perturbative behaviour at small r\u22a5 . By replacing\nEq. (4.8) with a Glauber\u2013type formula as shown in Eq. (2.53), the situation at high Q2 improves considerably and a wider range in Q2 can be\nfit within the framework of this model 73 . For other phenomenological\nmodels of the HERA data based on ideas of saturation see Refs. 74,75 .\nThe diffractive structure function F2D (xP , Q2 , \u03b2) (where xP =\n2\n(M +Q2 )/(W 2 +Q2 ) and \u03b2 = Q2 /(M 2 +Q2 ) where M is the diffractive\nmass and W is the total energy of the virtual photon-proton process)\nwas measured at HERA and several striking properties of the diffractive\nstructure function were observed. For instance, the ratio of \u03c3 dif f /\u03c3 is\nlarge and is nearly independent of W , a feature that was not anticipated\nin pQCD based models. In Ref. 43 , the simple model that describes the\ninclusive scattering data also describes the diffractive structure function\ndata. Interestingly, the form of the diffractive cross-section in this model\nis similar to the inclusive one except the dipole-hadron cross-section ap-\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\n21:22\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Review Volume\n\nQGP3 \u0307final \u0307web\n\nThe Color Glass Condensate and High Energy Scattering in QCD\n\npearing in the latter is replaced by the square of this cross-section i . The\nparameters appearing in the fit of the inclusive cross-section to the data\nare therefore the same as those used in the diffractive fit. The agreement with data is quite impressive given these constraints. A version of\nthe model has also been applied to study vector meson production with\nreasonable results 110,76 .\nWhereas the behaviour at high Q2 can be improved rather easily,\nby replacing Eq. (4.8) by Eq. (2.53) as mentioned above, the impact\nparameter dependence is problematic. This is expected to be especially\nimportant in a proton. Data on the t-dependence of differential crosssections, particularly for vector meson photoproduction, may be useful\nin understanding parton distributions in impact parameter space 76,77 .\n\n4.3. Geometric Scaling in DIS\nThe Golec-Biernat\u2013W\u00fcsthoff dipole cross-section, Eq. (4.8), has the\nremarkable feature to depends upon the two kinematical variables x\nand r\u22a5 only via the dimensionless combination (the \"scaling variable\")\n2 2\nT \u2261 r\u22a5\nQs (x). Via the factorization formula (2.47), this scaling property transmits to the virtual photon total cross-section \u03c3\u03b3 \u2217 p which, in\nthe limit where the quark masses are negligible, becomes a function of\nthe ratio Q2 /Q2s (x) alone (a property usually referred to as \"geometric scaling\"). At a first sight, this may appear an artifact of the simple\nparametrization (4.8) specific to the saturation model. Indeed, while the\nscaling looks natural at saturation one would na\u0131\u0308vely expect this scaling\nto be broken after generalizing Eq. (4.8) to reproduce the perturbative\n2 2\nbehaviour at high Q2 (e.g., the inclusion of the logarithm ln (1/r\u22a5\n\u039b )\nas in Eq. (2.51) would clearly violate scaling).\nIt thus appeared as a surprise when Sta\u015bto, Golec-Biernat and\nKwieci\u0144ski showed 45 that, to a rather good accuracy, the HERA data\non \u03c3\u03b3 \u2217 p do show scaling for small enough x (x < 0.01) and all Q2 up\nto 450GeV 2 (see Fig. 19). Such Q2 are significantly higher than the estimated value of the saturation scale at HERA, as extracted from the\n\"saturation model\" fits to F2 43 : Q2s \u2243 1 * * * 2 GeV2 . On the other hand,\nthe data show no scaling for larger values of x.\nSubsequently, some indications of geometric scaling have been found\nalso in the data for DIS off nuclei 93 , and even in the particle production\nat RHIC 38 , although, in these cases, the experimental evidence is more\nuncertain.\nIn the light of the previous discussion in Sect. 3, such a scaling behaviour should not look surprising any more. As explained in Sects.\n3.4 (for the scattering amplitude) and 3.5 (for the gluon distribution),\n\ni This\n\nfeature of the model can be understood very simply in the CGC picture 109 .\n\n63\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Review Volume\n\nQGP3 \u0307final \u0307web\n\nThe Color Glass Condensate and High Energy Scattering in QCD\n\n\u03c3tot\u03b3*p [\u03bcb]\n\n64\n\n21:22\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10 2\n\n10\n\nZEUS BPT 97\nZEUS BPC 95\n2\nH1 low Q 95\n2\nZEUS+H1 high Q 94-95\n\n1\n\nE665\nx<0.01\nall Q\n\n10\n\n2\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n1\n\n10\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\n\u03c4\n\nFig. 19.

Eq. (3.28)).\nIf one uses the phenomenological values of Qs alluded to before, and\n\u039bQCD = 0.2 * * * 0.3GeV, one finds that the maximum Q2 up to which\nscaling is expected is indeed of the order of a few hundred GeV2 , as\nobserved at HERA 45 .\nWithin the CGC formalism, the scaling properties of the dipolehadron scattering amplitude can be explicitly studied by using the Gaussian approximation to the weight function introduced in Sect. 3.6. The\nkernel of the Gaussian shows explicit scaling for all momenta k\u22a5 <\n\u223c\nQ2s (\u03c4 )/\u039bQCD , cf. Eq.

The Froissart Bound for dipole scattering\nLet us now address the fundamental question of the asymptotic behaviour of the total cross-section at very high energies. Thus far, in the\nanalysis of the dipole-hadron scattering, we have neglected the impact\nparameter dependence. We have assumed the hadron to be a homogeneous disk with radius R. Then all the theoretical descriptions which\ninclude saturation, from the phenomenological \"saturation model\" in\nEq. (4.8) to the QCD\u2013based formalisms like the CGC or the BalitskyKovchegov equation, lead a dipolar cross-section which approaches a\nconstant value \u03c30 = 2\u03c0R2 as s \u2192 \u221e. Although consistent with the\nFroissart bound 4,5 , this result cannot be right. From experiments, we\nknow indeed that hadronic cross-sections (e.g., for pp collisions) keep\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\n66\n\n21:22\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Review Volume\n\nQGP3 \u0307final \u0307web\n\nThe Color Glass Condensate and High Energy Scattering in QCD\n\ngrowing with s up to the highest energies that have been reached so\nfar. At very high energy, the growth is rather slow, and can be fitted by\neither a small power of s (the \"soft pomeron\" \u223c s0.08 ), or some power\nof ln s, or a combination of them. A recent analysis 81 of the data for\nseveral high-energy processes appears to favour a dominant behaviour of\nthe log\u2013squared type: \u03c3tot (s) \u2243 \u03c30 ln2 s, with an universal prefactor \u03c30 .\nIf true, this would imply that the Froissart bound is actually saturated\nin nature.\nSuch a steady growth of total cross-sections is also expected on physical grounds 78,79,80 . As a quantum mechanical bound state, the hadron\ndoes not have a sharp edge but rather a tail. In a theory with a mass\ngap like QCD, this tail is an exponential whose width is fixed by the\nlowest mass in QCD, namely the pion mass. Impact parameters which,\nat some initial energy, are far away in the tail of the distribution will\nnot contribute much to scattering, since the parton density is low there.\nBut with increasing energy, the local gluon density will increase rather\nfast as a power of s, since gluon recombination is not effective when the\ndensity is low. Eventually, for sufficiently large s, the local gluon density will become high enough for these impact parameters to contribute\nsignificantly to scattering. That is, with increasing energy, the effective\ninteraction radius of the hadron is expected to grow as well, which then\nresults in an increase of the total cross-section. In fact, since the local\nscattering amplitude N\u03c4 (r\u22a5 , b\u22a5 ) cannot exceed the unitarity, or \"black\",\nlimit N\u03c4 = 1, it is clear that, for sufficiently large energies, the increase\nof the cross-section with s will proceed via the expansion of the \"black\ndisk\" (= the central area of the hadron where the unitarity limit has\nbeen reached already).\nThis general discussion shows that a theoretical description of the\ndynamics of the black disk must combine two essential ingredients: i) a\nmechanism which ensures the unitarization of the scattering amplitude\nat fixed impact parameter, and ii) a description of the tail of the hadron\nwavefunction. In QCD, the second issue is certainly related to confinement, and is thus genuinely non-perturbative. But it has been unclear\nuntil recently whether the first issue, that of the unitarization, can be addressed in perturbation theory or not. Indeed, since gauge interactions\nare a priori long-ranged, it could well be that soft, non-perturbative,\ninteractions are responsible for the approach towards \"blackness\" at a\nfixed impact parameter. The \"infrared diffusion\" of the BFKL equation\nmay be seen as in argument in that sense.\nHowever, our present understanding of the physics of high parton\ndensities shows that the phenomenon of gluon saturation provides a\nperturbative framework for the study of unitarization. We have seen\nindeed that the perturbative, but non-linear, evolution equations yield a\nscattering amplitude which respects the unitarity bound (see Fig. 15 and\nEq. (4.9)). To study the expansion of the black disk, these equations must\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\n21:22\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Review Volume\n\nQGP3 \u0307final \u0307web\n\n67\n\nThe Color Glass Condensate and High Energy Scattering in QCD\n\nr\n\nQ\u22121\ns\n\nr\nx\nx\n\n\u03b3\u2217\n\nb\n\nb\n2\n\nQs (b)\n2\n\nQ\n\nQ2 = 1/r2\n\n\u039b\n\n2\n\n2\n\nR (Q )\nFig. 20.\ntions.\n\nRH\n\nb\n\nDipole-hadron scattering in longitudinal (left) and transverse right) projec-\n\nbe supplemented with some information about confinement and applied\nat impact parameters in the tail of hadron, namely, in the \"grey area\"\nat b\u22a5 > R(\u03c4, Q2 ).\nHere, R(\u03c4, Q2 ) is the radius of the black disk for an incoming dipole\n2\nwith transverse resolution Q2 \u2261 1/r\u22a5\nand relative rapidity \u03c4 = ln s/Q2 .\nThat is, N\u03c4 (r\u22a5 , b\u22a5 ) is of order one for b\u22a5 \u2264 R(\u03c4, Q2 ), but it drops\nrapidly for b\u22a5 > R(\u03c4, Q2 ).

This\ncondition leaves us with a perturbative grey corona at R(\u03c4, Q2 ) < b\u22a5 <\nRH (\u03c4 ), which is sufficient, as we shall see, to perform a controllable\ncalculation of the expansion rate of the black disk.\nSpecifically, for impact parameters within this corona, the dipole\n2\nundergoes mostly hard scattering, with transferred momenta k\u22a5\n\u226b\n2\nQs (\u03c4, b\u22a5 ) (cf. the discussion after Eq. (4.9)). This implies that it interacts predominantly with color sources which are relatively close in\nimpact parameter space, within a saturation disk of radius 1/Qs (\u03c4, b\u22a5 )\ncentered at b\u22a5 . Physically, it is so because of the screening phenomena\nassociated with saturation (cf. Sect. 3.5) : Color sources which lie further\naway create only dipolar fields at the impact parameter of the incoming\ndipole; such fields decrease rapidly with distance (more rapidly then the\nmonopole fields due to the nearby color sources), and thus contribute\nless to scattering 80,69 .\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\n68\n\n21:22\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Review Volume\n\nQGP3 \u0307final \u0307web\n\nThe Color Glass Condensate and High Energy Scattering in QCD\n\nMathematically, this means that scattering in the grey corona is\ncontrolled by the linear BFKL equation (3.4), but with an infrared cutoff\nof order Qs (\u03c4, b\u22a5 ). This cutoff simulates the non-linear terms, which, in\nthe full equation (3.7), would limit the range of the dominant interactions\nto 1/Qs (\u03c4, b\u22a5 ). Clearly, with such a cutoff, the BFKL equation is not\nafflicted by \"infrared diffusion\" any more. As in the previous calculation\nof the saturation scale in Sect. 3.4, the black disk radius can be computed\nby first solving the BFKL equation, and then imposing a saturation\ncondition similar to Eq. (3.21) :\nN\u03c4 (r\u22a5 , b\u22a5 ) \u2243 1\n\nfor\n\nb \u2243 R(\u03c4, Q2 ).\n\n(4.12)\n\nThe b\u22a5 \u2013dependence of the initial condition is determined by the\nnon-perturbative physics of the confinement, and thus requires a model.\nHowever, what we need to know about confinement is quite limited,\nand can be inferred from general principles. Firstly, what is the typical\nscale for transverse inhomogeneity in the hadron: this is clearly 1/\u039bQCD .\nSecondly, what is the b\u22a5 \u2013dependence of the scattering amplitude in the\nhadron tail. This is an exponential fall-off \u221d e\u22122m\u03c0 b where twice the\npion mass enters since the long range interactions between the dipole\nand the (isosinglet) gluons require the exchange of at least one pair of\npions (recall that pions have isospin one).\nThe first requirement tells us that the inhomogeneity occurs over\ntransverse scales much larger than the typical range of the interactions,\n<\n\u223c 1/Qs (\u03c4, b\u22a5 ). The scattering of the small dipole proceeds quasilocally\nin the impact parameter spacej . As a consequence, the b\u22a5 \u2013dependence\nof the solution to the (effective) BFKL equation factorizes, and is fixed\nby the initial condition 80 :\nN\u03c4 (r\u22a5 , b\u22a5 ) \u2248 N\u03c4 (r\u22a5 ) S(b\u22a5 ),\n\n(4.13)\n\nwhere N\u03c4 (r\u22a5 ) is the solution to the homogeneous BFKL equation, as\nshown in Eq.

The second condition provides the transverse profile function in the hadron tail: S(b\u22a5 ) \u221d e\u22122m\u03c0 b (the proportionality\ncoefficient is not important to the present accuracy).\nThe previous arguments, together with Eq.

This behaviour ensures the compensation between the exponential increase with\n\u03c4 (due to the perturbative BFKL evolution) and the exponential decrease\nwith b\u22a5 (due to confinement).\nSince N\u03c4 is rapidly decreasing at b\u22a5 \u226b R(\u03c4, Q2 ), the total crosssection is dominated by the black disk:\n\u03c3dipole (\u03c4, Q2 ) \u2243 2\u03c0R2 (\u03c4, Q2 ).\n\n(4.16)\n\nTogether with Eq. (4.15), this yields the following dominantl behaviour\nof the cross-section at high energies80 (see also Ref. 79 for an early\nstudy):\n\u00132\n\u0012\n\u03c0 \u03c9 \u1fb1s\n\u03c3dipole (s, Q2 ) \u2248\nln2 s\nas s \u2192 \u221e.\n(4.17)\n2 m\u03c0\nThis saturates the Froissart bound, with a universal coefficient for\nall hadrons and reflects the combined role of perturbative and nonperturbative physics in controlling the asymptotic behaviour at high\nenergy. This behaviour is in qualitative agreement with the phenomenological analysis in Ref. 81 , but the coefficient in Eq. (4.17) is too large to\nfit the data. The difference with respect to the data can be substantially\nreduced by using the RG-improved NLO estimate for the BFKL intercept, which decreases the leading-order value \u03c9 \u1fb1s by roughly a factor of\nthree 96,97 . In Refs. 82 , the result in Eq. (4.17) has been generalized to\n\u03b3 \u2217 \u2212 \u03b3 \u2217 scattering.\nFrom Eq. (4.14), one can also estimate the radius RH (\u03c4 ) where the\nsaturation scale decreases to \u039bQCD (beyond which perturbation theory\nfails to apply). This is the same as the black disk radius for a large dipole\nwith Q2 \u223c \u039b2QCD .

At impact parameters within the grey corona, these long-range\ncontributions are relatively small, and the evolution is driven by the\nshort-range interactions, with the conclusions outlined above. But for\nsufficiently large impact parameters, well beyond RH (\u03c4 ), the power-law\ncontributions will eventually supersede the exponentially decreasing one,\nand the hadron will develop an unphysical power-law tail. (This is unphysical since, in the real world, it is removed by confinement.) If one\npushes the perturbative expansion until the black disk enters this powerlaw tail, then its expansion rate speeds up, and violates the Froissart\nbound 83 . This is clearly an artifact of using perturbation theory outside\nits range of validity. The only way to circumvent this difficulty without\nintroducing ad-hoc modifications in the evolution equations (to account\nfor confinement) is to follow the perturbative evolution for only a limited\ninterval of \"time\" \u2206\u03c4 , such that perturbation theory remains valid. As\nexplained above, a limited evolution in time is indeed sufficient for the\ncalculation of the expansion rate of the black disk. The result of this\ncalculation can be then extrapolated to arbitrarily high energies, even\nthough the perturbative evolution eventually becomes meaningless.\nTo conclude, while perturbation theory alone appears to be sufficient\nto describe unitarization at fixed impact parameter, one still needs some\ninformation about the finite range of the strong interactions in order\nto compute total cross-sections. This is reminiscent of an old argument\nby Heisenberg 78 which combines unitarity and short-range interactions\n(as modelled by a Yukawa potential) to derive cross-sections which saturate the Froissart bound. Fifty years later, our progress in understanding\nstrong interactions allows us to confirm Heisenberg's intuition, and identify short-range interactions with confinement, and unitarization with\nsaturation.\n4.5. Saturation and Shadowing in Deep Inelastic Scattering\nShadowing is the phenomenon where F2A (x, Q2 )/AF2N (x, Q2 ) < 1 at\nsmall x (x < 0.1). It is a large effect in the region where the coherence\nlength of the probe (the q q\u0304-pair in DIS) lcoh \u223c 2m1N x exceeds the intranuclear longitudinal distance between any two nucleons in the nucleus.\nThe nuclear parton distribution is not merely the sum of nucleon parton\ndistributions but also contains the intereference between the parton distributions of the nucleons. When the coherence length is larger than the\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\n21:22\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Review Volume\n\nQGP3 \u0307final \u0307web\n\nThe Color Glass Condensate and High Energy Scattering in QCD\n\nnuclear diameter (lcoh \u226b 2A1/3 , or x << 1/(4mN A1/3 )), the q q\u0304\u2013pair\ninteracts coherently with the entire nucleus, and the collective effects are\nexpected to be imporatant.\nThere are several questions about shadowing that have not been\nunambiguously resolved in the framework of QCD.\n\u2022 Is shadowing a \"leadig twist\" effect, or it is suppressed by powers\nof Q2 ? An empirical answer to this question would help settle whether\nshadowing is an intrinsically leading twist phenomenon 84 or whether it\nis due to weak coupling, higher twist/high parton density effects 11,12,14 .\n\u2022 What is the relation of shadowing to parton saturation? Does parton\nsaturation provide a microscopic understanding of shadowing?\n\u2022 Does the shadowing ratio \"saturate\" at a minimum value for fixed Q2\nand A with decreasing x? Does it saturate faster for quarks or gluons?\n\u2022 What is the relation of shadowing in nuclei to diffractive scattering\nof nucleons? The relation is well established at low parton densities 85\nIn an interesting recent exercise, it has been shown that diffractive nucleon data at HERA could be used to predict the shadowing of quark\ndistributions observed by NMC 86,108 . Significant deviations from the\nsimple relation between shadowing and diffraction, may again suggest\nthe presence of strong non\u2013linearities.\n\u2022 Is shadowing universal? For instance, are gluon structure functions\nextracted from p-A collisions at RHIC identical to those extracted from\ne-A in the same kinematic region? The naive assumption that this is\ntrue may be incorrect if higher twist effects are important.\nThe answers to these questions will only be conclusively settled by\nthe next generation of p-A collider experiments at RHIC and LHC 87\nand by e-A collider experiments at RHIC (EIC/eRHIC) and/or DESY\n(HERA III)-see the following sub-section for a discussion of e-A collider\nplans.\nFrom the theoretical perspective, there are several shadowing models\nwhich consider only leading twist shadowing 108,88,89 . Namely, shadowing effects are put in the non-perturbative initial conditions, which are\nthen evolved in Q2 and x using the leading twist DGLAP equations 10 .\nModifications of these leading twist models to include Mueller-Qiu type\nnon-linear contributions have also been considered 90 .\nIn the McLerran-Venugopalan saturation model, the gluon distribution (defined as the integral over the unintegrated gluon distribution) is\nadditive in A. However, the structure functions computed as discussed\nin section 4.1 will exhibit shadowing for Q2 < Q2s . There have been a\nfew attempts to compute shadowing from the non-linear renormalization group equation. One of these calculations, which is based on the\nnon-linear equation derived in Ref. 54 , predicts that perturbative gluon\nshadowing will become large as one goes to smaller xBj 's 91 . Other more\nrecent computations of shadowing have been performed within the con-\n\n71\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\n72\n\n21:22\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Review Volume\n\nQGP3 \u0307final \u0307web\n\nThe Color Glass Condensate and High Energy Scattering in QCD\n\ntext of numerical solutions of the Balitsky-Kovchegov equation for both\ninclusive 67,93 and diffractive scattering 92 . In both cases, geometric\nscaling of the nuclear distributions is claimed but it is not clear that\nboth groups obtain the same A-dependence for the saturation scale. A\nvery interesting recent theoretical suggestion is that the scattering amplitude for high energy scattering for nuclei, at fixed impact parameter,\nis the same as for protons at asymptotic energies! 94 . Integrated over\nimpact parameter, this would suggest that shadowing saturates at very\nsmall x. The understanding of shadowing in the saturation picture is\nstill preliminary-more detailed global fits of the non-linear equations (as\nfor instance performed for the linear DGLAP fits) are needed. In addition, different computations of the A-dependence of the saturation scale\nwill likely converge as our theoretical understanding improves. Finally,\nas will be discussed in the following, the issue will likely not be resolved\nconclusively until DIS experiments off nuclei at small x are performed.\n4.6. Probing the CGC with an Electron Ion Collider\nA high energy electron\u2013nucleus collider, with a center of mass energy\n\u221a\ns = 60\u2013100 GeV, presents a remarkable opportunity to explore fundamental and universal aspects of QCD. The nucleus, at these energies,\nacts as an amplifier of the novel physics of high parton densities\u2013aspects\nof the theory that would otherwise only be explored in an electron\u2013\nproton collider with energies at least an order of magnitude greater than\nthat of HERA. An electon\u2013nucleus collider will also make the study of\nQCD in a nuclear environment, to an extent far beyond that achieved\npreviously, a quantitative science. In particular, it will help complement,\nclarify, and reinforce physics learnt at high energy nucleus\u2013nucleus and\nproton\u2013nucleus collisions at RHIC and LHC over the next decade. For\nboth of these reasons, an eA collider facility represents an important\nfuture direction in high energy nuclear physics.\nWe will briefly discuss here experimental observables in deep inelastic\nscattering (DIS) which are signatures of the novel physics of the Color\nGlass Condensate m . A more detailed discussion of the following can be\nfound in Ref. 101 .\nThe regime of small xBj 's (xBj \u2264 0.01) is easily accessed by an\n\u221a\nelectron\u2013heavy ion collider in the energy range s \u2248 60\u2013100 GeV. These\nenergies would be most natural if the Electron Ion Collider (EIC) were\nconstructed at BNL-this particular realization is called eRHIC. The kinematic coverage of EIC/eRHIC is shown in Fig. 21. What is novel about\nthese energies is that for the first time one can study the physics of\nxBj << 0.01 in a nucleus for Q2 >> \u039b2QCD , where \u039bQCD \u223c 200 MeV.\nm We\n\nwill not cover here the interesting physics at intermediate and large xBj that can be\nstudied with an eA collider.

The center of mass (c.m) energy of the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) is a factor of 10 smaller than that of the current ep-collider\nat HERA (the proposed HERA III plan-which includes e-A scattering\nwould have a center-of-mass energy that's roughly 3 times greater than\nEIC). However, an eA collider has a tremendous advantage\u2013the parton\ndensity in a nucleus, as experienced by a probe at a fixed energy, is much\nhigher than what it would experience in a proton at the same energy.\nSince the parton density grows as A1/3 , this effect is more pronounced\nfor the largest nuclei-see Eq. 1.13.\n\n2\n\n10\n\n5\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n2\n\n2\n\nQ (GeV )\n\nAbhay Deshpande at RBRC\n\nHERA\nFixed target \u03bc-DIS\nFixed target e-DIS\nEIC\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n-6\n\n10\n\n-5\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n1\n\nx\nFig. 21.

Impact parameter tagging\nis feasible by counting knock-out neutrons 112 \u2013if so, the gain in parton\ndensity in eA relative to ep may be even more spectacular.\nIn the following, we will discuss both inclusive and semi\u2013inclusive signatures of the CGC. The latter in particular are very difficult to measure\nin fixed target DIS\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\n74\n\n21:22\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Review Volume\n\nQGP3 \u0307final \u0307web\n\nThe Color Glass Condensate and High Energy Scattering in QCD\n\nInclusive signatures of the CGC\nAn obvious inclusive observable is the structure function F2 (xBj , Q2 )\nand its logarithmic derivatives with respect to xBj and Q2 . The EIC\nshould have sufficient statistical precision for one to extract the logarithmic derivative of F2 (and its logarithmic derivative!). Whether the\nsystematic errors at small xBj will affect the results is not clear at the\nmoment. The logarithmic derivative dF2 /d ln(Q2 ), at fixed xBj , and\nlarge Q2 , as a function of Q2 , is the gluon distribution. QCD fits implementing the DGLAP evolution equations should describe its behavior at\nlarge Q2 . At smaller Q2 , one should see a significant deviation from linear QCD fits\u2013in principle, if the Q2 range is wide enough, one should see\na turnover in the distribution. The Q2 at which the turnover takes place\nshould be systematically larger for smaller x's and for larger nuclei 74 .\nAt eRHIC one can extract the longitudinal structure function\nFL (xBj , Q2 ) = F2 \u22122 xBj F1 at small xBj independently since the energy\nof the colliding beams can be varied significantly. In the parton model,\nFL = 0\u2013thus FL is very sensitive to scaling violations. It provides an\nindependent measure of the gluon distribution 102 and in particular of\nhigher twist saturation effects which may be prominent in both FL and\nFT but may cancel in the sum 103 .\nThe extended kinematic range of EIC may help determine whether\nshadowing is entirely a leading twist phenomenon, or if there are large\nhigher twist perturbative corrections. As also discussed previously, there\nis a close relation between shadowing and diffraction. At EIC the validity\nof this relation can be explored directly\u2013different nuclear targets are\navailable, and the diffractive structure function may also be measured\nindependently.\nSemi\u2013inclusive signatures of the CGC\nA striking semi\u2013inclusive measurement is hard diffraction wherein\nthe virtual photon emitted by the electron fragments into a final state\n2\nX, with an invariant mass MX\n\u226b \u039b2QCD , while the proton emerges\nunscathed in the interaction. A large rapidity gap\u2013a region in rapidity\nessentially devoid of particles\u2013is produced between the fragmentation\nregion of the electron and that of the proton. In pQCD, the probability of\na gap is exponentially suppressed as a function of the gap size. At HERA\nthough, gaps of several units in rapidity are unsuppressed; one finds that\nroughly 10% of the cross\u2013section corresponds to hard diffractive events\nwith invariant masses MX > 3 GeV.\nHard diffraction probes the color singlet object (the \"Pomeron\")\nwithin the proton that interacts with the virtual photon. It addresses,\nin a novel fashion, the nature of confining interactions within hadrons.\nThe mass of the final state is large and one can reasonably ask questions about the quark and gluon content of the Pomeron.

Finally, if Pomeron structure is A\u2013dependent,\nsome models argue that RA1,A2 = F2,A1 /F2,A2 .\nThe ratio of RD = \u03c3diffractive /\u03c3total at HERA is \u223c 10% for MX > 3\nGeV. The systematics of hard diffraction at HERA can be understood\nin saturation models 43 . For eA collisions at EIC energies, saturation\nA\nmodels predict that the ratio RD\ncan be much higher\u2013on the order of\n106\n,108\n30% for the largest nuclei\n.\nAn important semi\u2013inclusive observable in eA DIS at high energies\nis coherent (or diffractive) and inclusive vector meson production. For\ninstance, the forward vector meson diffractive leptoproduction cross\u2013\nsection off nuclei is 107\n\nh\ni2\nd\u03c3\n|t=0 (\u03b3 \u2217 A \u2192 V A) \u221d \u03b12S (Q2 ) GA (x, Q2 ) ,\ndt\n\n(4.23)\n\nfor large Q2 and is therefore a sensitive probe of gluon saturation/shadowing. It is very important to measure inclusive and diffractive\nopen charm and jets since they provide useful and complementary data\nto those of vector mesons.\nDue to large color fluctuations at small xBj , on can expect: a) a\nbroader rapidity distribution in larger nuclei relative to lighter nuclei\nand protons, b) Enhanced anomalous multiplicity distributions where\nanomalous multiplicity in one rapidity interval in an event would be\naccompanied by an anomalous multiplicity in rapidity intervals several\nunits away 111 , and c) a correlation between the central multiplicity\nwith the multiplicity of neutrons in a forward neutron detector 112 .\nIn pA scattering at RHIC one also has the opportunity to study the\nhigh parton densitiy phenomena-see section 5.5 for a discussion. Some of\nthe differences between pA and eA are as follows. In the pA Drell\u2013Yan\nprocess, it is very hard to reliably extract distributions in the region\nbelow the \u03a8\u2032 tail\u2013 namely, one requires Q2 > 16 GeV2 . In the x region\nof interest, one expects saturation effects to be important at lower Q2\nof 1\u201310 GeV2 . For Q2 = 16 GeV2 , one might have to go to significantly\nsmaller x's to see large saturation effects. Secondly, the survival probability of large rapidity gaps is smaller in pA relative to eA. This is\nbecause in pA (unlike eA) the gap is destroyed due to secondary interactions between \"spectator\" partons in the proton and the \"Pomeron\"\nfrom the nucleus. Thus one expects that diffractive vector meson and jet\nproduction in pA should be qualitatively different than what one will\nsee in eA.\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\n21:22\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Review Volume\n\nQGP3 \u0307final \u0307web\n\nThe Color Glass Condensate and High Energy Scattering in QCD\n\n5. Melting the CGC in Nucleus-Nucleus and\nProton-Nucleus Collisions\nIn general, the problem of high energy hadron\u2013hadron collisions is very\ndifficult. As we discussed in the introductory section, a full understanding of multi-particle production in high energy collisions is one of the\noutstanding problems in high energy QCD. The approach developed in\nprevious sections however suggests that classical methods may be useful in studying multi-particle production in high energy collisions. In\nthis section, we will discuss applications of this approach in describing\nthe initial stages of very high energy heavy ion collisions, proton (or\ndeuteron)\u2013nucleus collisions and briefly, peripheral nucleus-nucleus collisions.\nUnderstanding the initial conditions for heavy ion collisions is of\nthe utmost importance in studying the high energy heavy ion experiments performed at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at BNL\nand (to be performed) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN.\nThe initial conditions are crucial in determining whether the quarkgluon matter produced immediately after the collision will equilibrate\nto briefly form a thermalized Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP). Classical\nmethods are applicable because the occupation numbers of gluons in the\nnuclear wavefunctions (and immediately after the collision) are of order\n1/\u03b1S . One can therefore study the space-time evolution of partons which\nare \"frozen\" in the Color Glass Condensate through their release in the\ncollision and their subsequent evolution. Unfortunately, it is not possible\nin this approach to follow their evolution all the way to equilibration.\nThis is because the gluon occupation numbers become small well before equilibration thereby signalling the breakdown of the classical field\napproach.\nSince the classical field equations are fully non-linear, they cannot be\nsolved analytically n . The solutions can however be determined numerically and the initial energy and number distributions can be obtained.\nA particular feature of our formulation of the scattering problem is that\nthe classical Yang-Mills field equations are boost invariant-the equations\nare independent of the space-time rapidity. The boost invariance leads\nto a significant simplification-the classical Yang-Mills equations are only\nfunctions now of the two transverse spatial directions and the propertime.\nIn order to maintain gauge invariance, the numerical problem is formulated on the lattice and solved as a function of proper time. In the\nfollowing, we will discuss briefly the numerical procedure and the results\nof the simulations. The non-perturbative results can be compared to the\nresults of analytical computations at large transverse momenta and we\nwill show that they agree with these computations.\nn For\n\nrecent analytical work in this direction, see Ref. 114\n\n77\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\n78\n\n21:22\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Review Volume\n\nQGP3 \u0307final \u0307web\n\nThe Color Glass Condensate and High Energy Scattering in QCD\n\nThe results of these numerical computations can now be interpreted\nin light of the recent data from RHIC. We will discuss some of the\nphenomenological consequences of our results-in particular the implications for the importance of final state interactions of partons (beyond\nthe initial stage of high occupation numbers) and their subsequent thermalization. Quantum effects, such as the non-trivial geometric scaling\ndiscussed earlier, may also play an important role in interpreting the\nvery interesting and in some instances very puzzling RHIC data.\nAs we will discuss, a contentious issue in deciphering the RHIC data\nis whether the phenomena observed are primarily due to initial state or\nfinal state effects. Experiments underway at RHIC on Deuteron-Gold\ncollisions should help settle the issue since one expects final state effects\nin these collisions to be relatively unimportant o Recently, there have\nbeen several papers studying various final states at RHIC energies in\nthe CGC model. We will discuss these works and their predictions for\nthe RHIC data. Finally, we will also discuss briefly the predictions of\nthe CGC model for particle production in peripheral nucleus-nucleus\ncollisions.\n5.1. Classical Picture of Nuclear Collisions\nThe classical picture of nuclear collisions was first formulated by\nKovner, McLerran and Weigert 29 in the framework of the McLerranVenugopalan model for a single nucleus. At very high energies, P + \u2192 \u221e\nof one of the nuclei (and P \u2212 \u2192 \u221e for the other), the hard valence quark\n(and gluon) modes are highly Lorentz contracted, static sources of color\ncharge for the wee parton, Weizs\u00e4cker\u2013Williams, modes in the nuclei.\nFor simplicity, we will first consider only central collisions of cylindrical nuclei with uniform matter distributions. The case of realistic nuclei\nand non-central collisions will be discussed later. The valence sources are\nthen described by the current\nJ \u03bd,a (r\u22a5 ) = \u03b4 \u03bd+ \u03c1a1 (r\u22a5 )\u03b4(x\u2212 ) + \u03b4 \u03bd\u2212 \u03c1a2 (r\u22a5 )\u03b4(x+ ) ,\n\n(5.1)\n\nwhere \u03c11(2) correspond to the color charge densities of the hard modes in\nnucleus 1 (nucleus 2) respectively. The \u03b4-function in x\u2212 for the valence\nparton current of one nucleus (or \u03b4-function in x+ for the other) implies\nthat we are literally assuming the nuclei to move at the speed of light. In\nreality of course this condition should and can be relaxed. We will discuss\nthis issue later on in this section. In the collision, these valence partons\nare assumed to be Eikonal sources-they continue on their straight line\no Scattering\n\neffects that are often thought of as \"final state\" effects in proton-nucleus\neffects can, in a different gauge, be interpreted as initial state effects 27 . The final state\neffects emphasized here are those involving re-scattering of on-shell partons off each\nother.\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\n21:22\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Review Volume\n\nQGP3 \u0307final \u0307web\n\n79\n\nThe Color Glass Condensate and High Energy Scattering in QCD\n\ntrajectories along the light cones. They may acquire a phase due to the\nrotation of the color charge in the scattering 115 . However, in the gauge\nwe will use, no such phase will appear in our treatment of the classical\nscattering problem.\nFor each color configuration in each of the nuclei, the classical field\ndescribing the small x modes in the Effective Field Theory (EFT) is\nobtained by solving the Yang\u2013Mills equations in the presence of the two\nsources.

Fixing this\ngauge however does not fix the gauge completely. The residual gauge\nfreedom can be fixed by imposing the Coulomb gauge condition \u2207\u22a5 *\nA\u22a5 = 0 in the two transverse dimensions.\nSubstituting Eq. (5.5) in Eq. (5.2), and re-writing the equations in\nterms of the transverse coordinates x\u22a5 , the proper time \u03c4 and the spacetime rapidity \u03b7, one observes that the Yang-Mills are independent of \u03b7,\nnamely, they are boost invariant. The fields \u03b1i3 and \u03b1 are functions of\nx\u22a5 and \u03c4 only. The boost invariance of the solutions of the Yang-Mills\nequations is entirely due to our approximation-using \u03b4-function sources.\nSmearing the sources in rapidity would destroy the boost-invariance of\nthe solutions. Nevertheless, one expects that the boost-invariance approximation is a reliable one especially at central rapidities in a nuclear\ncollision. This point will be discussed further.\nThe initial conditions for the solution of the Yang\u2013Mills equations\nin the forward light cone are determined by matching the solutions in\nthe space-like and time-like regions at \u03c4 = 0. Requiring that the gauge\nfields be regular at \u03c4 = 0, the coefficients of the singular pieces of the\nequations D\u03bci F \u03bci = 0 and D\u03bc\u00b1 F \u03bc\u00b1 = J \u00b1 (for x\u2212 , x+ \u2192 0) have to be\nset to zero. These give the boundary conditions at \u03c4 = 0:\n\u03b1i3 (0, x\u22a5 ) = \u03b1i1 (0, x\u22a5 ) + \u03b1i2 (0, x\u22a5 ),\n(5.8)\ni i\ni\n\u03b1(0, x\u22a5 ) = [\u03b11 (0, x\u22a5 ), \u03b12 (0, x\u22a5 )].\n(5.9)\n2\nThese conditions, first formulated for infinitely large nuclei, are the same\nfor finite nuclei as well. The boundary conditions remain the same even\nwhen the fields \u03b1i1,2 before the collision are smeared out in rapidity properly account for singular contact terms in the equations of motion 116 .\nFurther, since the equations are very singular at \u03c4 = 0, the only condition on the derivatives of the fields that would lead to regular solutions\nare \u2202\u03c4 \u03b1|\u03c4 =0 , \u2202\u03c4 \u03b1i\u22a5 |\u03c4 =0 = 0.\nPerturbative solutions of the Yang\u2013Mills equations to order \u03c12 in\nthe color charge density (or equivalently to second order in \u039bs /k\u22a5 ) were\nfound, and at late times, after averaging over the Gaussian sources, the\nnumber distribution of classical gluons was found to be 29,116,115\n2\n6 4\ndN\n2 2g \u03bc Nc (Nc \u2212 1)\n=\n\u03c0R\nL(k\u22a5 , \u03bb) ,\n4\ndyd2 k\u22a5\n(2\u03c0)4\nk\u22a5\n\n(5.10)\n\nwhere L(k\u22a5 , \u03bb) is an infrared divergent function at the scale \u03bb.

What is novel about\nthe classical approach is that, at sufficiently high energies, the non\u2013\nlinearities in the Yang\u2013Mills fields self\u2013consistently regulate this infrared\ndivergence. To confirm this claim, one needs to solve the Yang\u2013Mills\nequations to all orders in \u039bs /k\u22a5 . This is very difficult to do analytically.\nFortunately, as we will discuss in section 5.2, the classical problem can\nbe solved numerically.\nThe discussion here has been extended to treat the collision of finite,\nultrarelativistic nuclei with realistic nuclear matter distributions 119 .\nFor the case of finite nuclei, the issue of color neutrality, as discussed\nin sections 2.4 and 3.10, becomes very important. A global neutrality\nconstraint at the level of the nucleus is insufficient to ensure that there\nare no large field strengths outside the nuclear radius-color neutrality\nmust be imposed at the nucleon level. The practical implementation of\ncolor neutrality will be discussed further in the following.\nAs mentioned earlier, a major simplification occurs in the classical\napproach when boost invariance is assumed. It is likely a good approximation, especially in the central region, but the effects of relaxing this\ncondition are unclear. A first step in answering this question (before\nperforming a fully 3+1-dimensional simulation) is to study the stability of the 2+1-dimensional results with respect to a perturbation in the\n\u03b7-direction 120 .\n5.2. Numerical Gluodynamics of Nuclear Collisions\nClassical real time numerical solutions of gauge theories were first discussed in the context of sphaleron transitions during the electroweak\nphase transition in the early universe 28 . Similar techniques can be applied to discuss the problem at hand. It is most convenient to follow\nthe Hamiltonian approach, namely, to construct the appropriate lattice\nHamiltonian and solve Hamilton's equations on the lattice with the lattice analog of the initial conditions discussed in section 5.1. These will be\ndiscussed below.

The color\ncharge squared \u039b2s was taken to be a constant for the uniform cylindrical nuclei. Furthermore, color neutrality was imposed only in a global\nsense 50 , namely, the color charge distribution over the entire nucleus\nwas constrained to be zero. While very useful in obtaining first estimates\nof the space-time evolution of the produced gluonic matter, these studies did not make predictions for realistic nuclear collisions. In addition,\nstudies of the distributions in peripheral collisions, in particular of the\nazimuthal anisotropy associated with elliptic flow, require finite nuclei\nand realistic nuclear matter distributions within each nucleus. These requirements were discussed in Refs. 118,119 .\nThe problem with color neutrality for a finite nucleus can be stated\nsimply as follows. If we impose the simple and obvious constraint that the\ncolor charge distribution must be zero outside the nucleus, the solution\nof Poisson's equation can still give a non-zero gluon distributions outside\nthe nucleus. In two dimensions, the fall-off of the gluon field is rather slow\nas shown in Fig. 5.2. This slow fall-off is a problem for a finite nucleus\nsince the gluon field is associated with a non-zero field strength.

Our numerical procedure to implement the constraint for finite nuclei is as follows. We first sample A nucleons on a discrete lattice requiring that they satisfy a Woods-Saxon nuclear density profile in the transverse plane. Note that this procedure generates the same distribution\nin the continuum as \u039b2s (x\u22a5 ) = \u039b2s0 TA (x\u22a5 )\nR\u221e\nwhere TA (x\u22a5 ) = \u2212\u221e dz \u03ba(r) is a thickness function, x\u22a5 is the transverse coordinate vector (the reference frame here being the center of the\nnucleus), \u03ba(r) is the Woods-Saxon nuclear density profile, and \u039b2s0 is\nthe color charge squared per unit area in the center of each nucleus. The\nonly external dimensional variables in the model are \u039bs0 and the nuclear\nradius R.\nNext, Gaussian color charge distributions are generated on the lattice. The probability distribution of color charge in a nucleon is expressed\nas\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nN\nX\n\u03c12j\n\uf8f8,\nP [\u03c1] = exp \uf8ed\u2212\n(5.17)\n2\u039b2n,j\nj\n\n\u03c1 (p T) (a.u.)\n\nwhere \u039b2n,j is the color charge distribution squared, per unit area, of\na nucleon at a lattice site j and N is the number of lattice sites that\ncomprise a nucleon. \u039b2n,j is obtained from \u039b2s0 by assuming that the\ncolor charges of the nucleons add incoherently. There are two versions\nof the subsequent step. In the first (whichP\nwe term Color Neutral I), we\nsubtract from every \u03c1j the spatial average j \u03c1j /N in order to guarantee\ncolor neutrality h\u03c1i = 0 for each nucleon. In the second (termed Color\nNeutral II), the dipole moment d of each nucleon is eliminated in a\nsimilar manner.\n\n1.4\nMV\ncolor neutral I\ncolor neutral II\n\n1.2\n1\n3\n\n0.8\n\n2\n\npT\n\npT\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5\np T/ \u039b s0\nFig. 24.

In the MV model, \u03c1\u0303(p\u22a5 ) is a constant everywhere\nexcept at p\u22a5 = 0 where it is constrained to be zero from the global charge\nconstraint. In the Color Neutral I (II) variant, we see that \u03c1\u0303(p\u22a5 ) \u223c p2\u22a5\n(\u223c p3\u22a5 ) for small momenta p\u22a5 < \u039bs0 and is constant at larger momenta.\nThe oscillatory behavior seen for Color Neutral I and II is due to the fact\nthat the correlator in coordinate space is not strictly a delta-function.\nIn the coordinate space the charge correlator for the two models, Color\nNeutral I and II, falls off rapidly, as \u223c 1/x4\u22a5 and \u223c 1/x5\u22a5 respectively,\nat larger distances.\nIt is an interesting coincidence that the behavior of \u03c1\u0303(p\u22a5 ) in our\nmodel is similar to the behavior expected from the renormalization group\n(RG) evolution of color charges in the McLerran-Venugopalan model as\ndiscussed here in Section 3.10. In Refs. 16,123 , it is shown that the\nscreening of color charges due to the RG evolution gives a behavior\n\u03c1\u0303(p\u22a5 ) \u223c p2\u22a5 for p\u22a5 \u2264 \u039bs0 (and \u03c1\u0303(p\u22a5 )=constant for p\u22a5 > \u039bs0 ).\n\niii) Numerical Results for Distributions in Energy and Number\nin Central Collisions\nWe will now discuss results for central collisions of very large cylindrical nuclei. We will see later that they are not very different from\nthose for central collisions of realistic nuclei. There are only two free\nparameters for the problem of nuclear collisions as formulated int the\nEFT. One is the saturation scale \u039bs while the other is the nuclear radius R p (For an infinite cylindrical nucleus, one has \u03c0R2 = L2 , where L\nis the lattice size.) Any dimensional quantity P , well defined within the\nEFT, can be written in terms of the physically relevant parameters \u039bs\nand R as \u039bds fP (\u039bs R), where d is the dimension of P . The non\u2013trivial\nphysical information is therefore contained in the dimensionless function\nfP (\u039bs R). On the lattice, P will generally depend on the lattice spacing a; this dependence can be removed by taking the continuum limit\na \u2192 0. The broad range of physically relevant values of \u039bs for RHIC and\nLHC energies are \u223c 1-2 GeV and 2-4 GeV respectively-corresponding to\n\u039bs R \u2248 30-120 approximatelyq . Also, for central Au\u2013Au collisions, we\np Strictly speaking, the saturation scale is not a free parameter since it can be determined\nfrom the gluon density as in Ref. 72,27 . However, for the momentum scales of interest,\nthere is much uncertainity in the gluon density. Moreover, for nuclei, gluon shadowing contributions are not under control. Our results will therefore be non-perturbative\nformulae valid for a wide range of \u039bs .\nq If we extrapolate from the Golec-Biernat HERA parametrization, we get \u039b = 1.4 GeV\ns\nfor RHIC and \u039bs = 2.2 GeV for LHC.\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\n86\n\n21:22\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Review Volume\n\nQGP3 \u0307final \u0307web\n\nThe Color Glass Condensate and High Energy Scattering in QCD\n\nobtain L = 11.6 fm as the physical linear dimension of our square lattice.\n0.35\n(a)\n\n3\n\n\u2208\u03c4 / \u039b S\n\n0.3\n0.25\n0.2\n\nSU3\nSU2*8/3\n\n0.15\n\n3\n\n\u2208 \u03c4 /\u039b s\n\n0.1\n0\n\n0.3\n0.28\n0.26\n0.24\n0.22\n0.2\n0.18\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8 10 12 14 16 18 20\n\u039bS \u03c4\n(b)\n\nSU3: \u039b s R=50\nSU3: \u039b s R=167.4\nSU2*8/3: \u039b sR=50\nSU2*8/3: \u039b sR=167.4\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\u039b sa\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\nFig. 25.

In Figure 5.2 (a), we plot the Hamiltonian density, for a particular fixed value\nof \u039bs R = 167.4 (on a 512 \u00d7 512 lattice) in dimensionless units as a function of the proper time in dimensionless units. We note that \u03b5\u03c4 converges\nvery rapidly to a constant value. The form of \u03b5\u03c4 is well parametrized by\nthe functional form \u03b5\u03c4 = \u03b1 + \u03b2 exp(\u2212\u03b3\u03c4 ). Here dET /d\u03b7/\u03c0R2 = \u03b1 has\nthe proper interpretation of being the energy of produced gluons per\nunit area per unit rapidity, while \u03c4D = 1/\u03b3/\u039bs is the \"formation time\"\nof the produced glue.\nIn Figure 5.2 (b), the convergence of \u03b1 to the continuum limit is\nshown as a function of the lattice spacing in dimensionless units for two\nvalues of \u039bs R. In Ref. 31 , this convergence to the continuum limit was\nstudied extensively in an SU(2) gauge theory for very large lattices (up\nto 1024 \u00d7 1024 sites) and shown to be linear. The trend is the same for\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\n21:22\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Review Volume\n\nQGP3 \u0307final \u0307web\n\n87\n\nThe Color Glass Condensate and High Energy Scattering in QCD\n\nthe SU(3) results-thus, despite being further from the continuum limit\nfor SU(3) (due to the significant increase in computer time) a linear\nextrapolation is justified. We can therefore extract the continuum value\nfor \u03b1.\nNumerical results for the physically relevant RHIC and LHC initial\nconditions were discussed in several papers 31,32,33,118,119 . Very recently, Lappi pointed out that the overall normalization in Eq. 5.19 was\nincorrect and the fE computed in Refs. 31,33 is too large by a factor of\ntwo 121,122 . As we will discuss below, the normalization for the number\nis correct. Wherever feasible, the corrected results will be discussed below. We find fE (50) = 0.269 and fE (167.4) = 0.248. The RHIC and LHC\nvalues likely lie in this wide range of \u039bs R. The SU(2) value is approximately half the SU(3) value. Note that the variation of fE as a function\nof \u039bs R is extremely weak.The formation time \u03c4D = 1/\u03b3/\u039bs is essentially the same for for both the SU(3) and SU(2) cases-for \u039bs R = 167.4,\n\u03b3 = 0.362 \u00b1 0.023 and . As discussed in Ref. 31 , it is \u223c 0.3 fm for RHIC\nand \u223c 0.13 fm for LHC (taking \u039bs = 2 GeV and 4 GeV respectively-for\nthe values of \u039bs extracted using the Golec-Biernat fit, the corresponding\ntimes are of course larger).\nWe now combine our expression in Eq. (5.19) with our nonperturbative expression for the formation time to obtain a nonperturbative formula for the initial energy density 122 ,\n\u03b5=\n\n0.08 4\n\u039bs\ng2\n\n(5.20)\n\nThis formula gives a rough estimate of the initial energy density, at a\nformation time of \u03c4D = 1/\u03b3\u0304/\u039bs R where we have taken the average value\nof the slowly varying function \u03b3 to be \u03b3\u0304 \u223c 0.3. For \u039bs = 1.4 GeV, one\nobtains \u03b5 \u223c 10 GeV/fm3 .\nWe now report our results for the initial multiplicity of gluons produced at central rapidities. First consider a free field theory whose Hamiltonian in momentum space has the form\nHf =\n\n\u0011\n1X\u0010\n|\u03c0(k)|2 + \u03c9 2 (k) |\u03c6(k)|2 ,\n2\n\n(5.21)\n\nk\n\nwhere \u03c6(k) is the kth momentum component of the field, \u03c0(k) is its\nconjugate momentum, and \u03c9(k) is the corresponding eigenfrequency. The\naverage particle number of the k-th mode is then\nq\n(5.22)\nN (k) = \u03c9(k)h|\u03c6(k)|2 i = h|\u03c6(k)|2 |\u03c0(k)|2 i, .\nIn our case, the average hi is over the initial conditions.\nWe use two different generalizations of the particle number to an\ninteracting theory. We have verified that the two definitions agree in the\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\n88\n\n21:22\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Review Volume\n\nQGP3 \u0307final \u0307web\n\nThe Color Glass Condensate and High Energy Scattering in QCD\n\nweak-coupling regime at late times 31 . Our first definition is based on\nthe behavior of a free-field theory under cooling. We obtain 32\nr Z \u221e\ndt\n8\n\u221a V (t) ,\nN=\n(5.23)\n\u03c0 0\nt\nwhere t is the cooling time (not to be confused with real or proper time),\nand V (t) is the potential energy of the relaxed free field after cooling. The\nrelaxed potential V (t) is gauge-invariant-hence so is this definition of the\nparticle number. This is an attractive feature of the cooling method. Unfortunately, it presently only permits determination of the total particle\nnumber and cannot be used to find the number distribution N (k\u22a5 ).\nOur second definition of the multiplicity will enable us to compute\nN (k\u22a5 ). We impose the Coulomb gauge condition in the transverse plane,\n~ \u22a5 *A\n~ \u22a5 = 0, and substitute the momentum components of the resulting\n\u2207\nfield configuration into Eq. (5.22). We can determine N (k\u22a5 ) from the\nrightmost expression of Eq. (5.22); the middle expression of Eq. (5.22)\ncan then be used to obtain \u03c9(k\u22a5 ).\nIn Fig. 26(a), we plot the normalized gluon transverse momentum\ndistributions versus k\u22a5 /\u039bs with the value \u039bs R = 167.4, for both the\nSU(3) and SU(2) gauge theories r . Clearly, we see that the normalized\nresult for SU(3) is suppressed relative to the SU(2) result in the low\nmomentum region. In Fig. 26 (b), we plot the same quantity over a wider\nrange in k\u22a5 /\u039bs for two values of \u039bs R. At large transverse momentum,\nwe see that the distributions scale exactly as Nc2 \u2212 1, the number of\ncolor degrees of freedom. This is as expected since, at large transverse\nmomentum, the modes are nearly those of non\u2013interacting harmonic\noscillators. At smaller momenta, the suppression is due to non-linearities,\nwhose effects, we have confirmed, are greater for larger values of the\neffective coupling \u039bs R.

The results from the Cooling and Coulomb methods also show\nvery good agreement (less than 10%) especially for larger values of \u039bs R.\nIf we take the ratio of Eq. (5.19) to Eq.

For peripheral nuclear collisions, the\ninteraction region is a two-dimensional almond shaped region, with the\nx axis lying along the impact parameter axis and the y direction perpendicular to it and to the beam direction. Even though large electric\nand magnetic fields (and the corresponding transverse components of the\npressure in the x and y directions) are generated over very short time\nscales \u03c4 \u223c 1/\u039bs , the significant differences in the pressures, responsible\nfor elliptic flow, are only built up over much longer time scales \u03c4 \u223c R.\nThis can be seen in Fig. 27 where we plot the two transverse components\nof the pressure (Txx and Tyy ) and the energy density as a function of\nproper time (in units of \u039bs0 ) for a peripheral nuclear collision. Moreover,\nthe elliptic flow is generated by soft modes pT \u223c \u039bs /8. Our result has\nimportant consequences for the theoretical interpretation of the RHIC\ndata-these will be discussed later in the text.\nThe elliptic flow, defined by Eq. (5.28), can be computed, as in the\ncase of the gluon multiplicity, in two different ways; directly in Coulomb\nGauge (CG) and by solving a system of relaxation (cooling) equations for\nthe fields. It is easy to show that v2 N , N being the total gluon number,\ncan be reconstructed from the cooling time history of Txx \u2212 Tyy , just as\nN can be reconstructed from that of the energy functional 32 :\nv2 N =\n\nr\n\n2\n\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n0\n\ndt\n\u221a (T xx (t) \u2212 T yy (t)) .\nt\n\n(5.29)\n\nThis expression for v2 N is manifestly gauge invariant.\n\nv 2 (%)\n\n8\nCG v.s.Cooling\n\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n\ncorrected values\n\n0\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9\nn ch/n max\nFig. 28.

The systematic errors represented by the band (for \u039bs0 = 37 are primarily due to limited resources\navailable to study the slow convergence of the cooling and CG computations. We have studied the late time behavior of v2 for one impact\nparameter-the results are shown in the figure.\nThe asymptotic values of v2 , as predicted by the model, undershoot\nthe data. For a fixed impact parameter, the model predicts that, as\n\u039bs0 R \u2192 \u221e, the classical contribution to the elliptic flow goes to zero.\nThis is because increasing \u039bs0 R is equivalent to increasing R for fixed\n\u039bs0 and therefore reducing the initial anisotropy.\nIn Fig 5.2, v2 (p\u22a5 ) is plotted for b/2R = 0.75 for \u039bs0 R = 148. Our\ncalculations show that the elliptic flow rises rapidly and is peaked for\np\u22a5 \u223c \u039bs0 /8 before falling rapidly.

The lattice numerical data appear to\nconfirm this result-better statistics are required to determine the large\nmomentum behavior accurately. The dominant contribution of very soft\nmodes to v2 helps explain why the cooling and CG computations differ\nuntil very late times. The soft gluon modes have large magnitudes and\ntherefore continue to interact strongly until very late proper times. Concomitantly, the occupation number of these modes is not small and the\nclassical approach may be adequate to describe these modes even at the\nlate times considered.\n\n16\n14\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n0\n\nb/2R=0.75\n\n\u039b s0R=148\n\n0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9\n\n1\n\np T / \u039b s0\nFig. 29. v2 (p\u22a5 ) as a function of transverse momentum in dimensionless units for\n\u039bs0 R = 148.\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\n21:22\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Review Volume\n\nQGP3 \u0307final \u0307web\n\ndN/d \u03b7 |\u03b7 =0/(N part /2)\n\nThe Color Glass Condensate and High Energy Scattering in QCD\n\n4\n3.8\n3.6\n3.4\n3.2\n3\n2.8\n2.6\n2.4\n2.2\n2\n50\n\n93\n\n\u039b s(0)=1.18\n\u039b s(0)=1.95\nPHENIX (130)\nPHOBOS (130)\n100 150 200 250 300 350 400\nN part\n\nFig. 30.

Melting the Color Glass Condensate at RHIC\nIn Fig 5.3, we plot the computed centrality dependence of gluons together\nwith the experimental data from PHOBOS 132 and PHENIX 131 . We\nassume here that the charged particle multiplicity is two thirds of the\ngluon number. The classical computation is performed for fixed \u03b1s ; the\ncentrality dependence, as seen from Eq. (5.27), comes from the dependence of fN on the impact parameter. In Ref. 32 , it was shown that\nfN \u2261 fN (\u039bs R) increases slowly with \u039bs R-hence one expects it to vary\nwith impact parameter. We see that the results agree reasonably well\nwith the data.\nThe centrality dependence of the transverse energy is studied in\nFig. 5.3. As in the case of the multiplicity, even though the absolute\nnormalization is strongly dependent on one's choice of \u039bs , the centrality dependence is very similar for the two \u039bs 's and shows reasonable\nagreement with the data.\nLet us now compare our results with those derived previously by\nKharzeev and Nardi in Ref. 36 and discussed further in Ref. 134 .

Comparison of the centrality dependence of the gluon transverse energy distribution from SU(3) lattice results to data from experiments 133 . The strong coupling\nconstant is fixed to the value g 2 = 4. The lattice results for \u039bs (0) = 1.95 GeV are scaled\nby 14 while those for \u039bs (0) = 1.18 are scaled by 87 .\n\nthe physically interesting regime, it is difficult to distinguish between the\ntwo. A reasonable agreement with the data is also seen in this formulation\nof the problem.\nThe relation between the two formulations is as follows. What we\nsimulate numerically is the color charge squared per unit area, \u039b2s 32 .\nThe saturation scale, on the other hand, is a scale determining the\nbehaviour of the gluon number distribution 27 . The relation between\nthe two is given in Eq. 5.4. The relation between cN and fN is then\ncN = 4\u03c0 2 fN /(Nc2 \u2212 1)/ ln(Q2s /\u039b2QCD ). Therefore, if cN is to be a constant, fN increases logarithmically with Qs . A weak rise in fN is seen in\nour simulations. If the infrared scale, as argued in Ref. 46 , is a number\nof order O(1/Qs ), we would have \u039bs \u2248 Qs . This is indeed the case in\npractice 119 .\nThe initial transverse energy per particle is ET /N \u223c 0.88\u039bs , which\nfor the Golec-Biernat value of \u039bs = 1.4 GeV (also the value favored by\nRefs. 36,37 ), gives ET /N = 1.23 GeV. This is a factor of 2 larger than\nthe value for measured charged hadrons 133 . For this value of \u039bs , the initial number of gluons is approximately half the multiplicity of hadrons at\ncentral rapidity. The excess ratio of ET /N in the initial state can be reduced by a) inelastic fragmentation of partons, which increases N and b)\nthermalization and hydrodynamic expansion expansion which increases\nN and decreases ET respectively. Thermalization increases the particle\nnumber because it is driven primarily by inelastic partonic processes 34 .\nIt is very conceivable that the multiplicity increases by a factor of two\ndue to either a) or b) or both. Thermalization increases the particle\nnumber because it is driven primarily by inelastic partonic processes 34 .\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\n21:22\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Review Volume\n\nQGP3 \u0307final \u0307web\n\nThe Color Glass Condensate and High Energy Scattering in QCD\n\nThe p\u22a5 distributions from the melting of the CGC were discussed\npreviously. The distributions obtained numerically from purely classical\nconsiderations can be used as initial conditions in parton transport equations which describe the evolution of the system when the description\nin terms of classical fields is inadequate. The parton distributions exhibit geometric scaling-they are functions of p\u22a5 /\u039bs alone. (At large p\u22a5\n(p\u22a5 >> \u039bs ), one expects this classical geometric scaling break down and\ndistributions to be described by perturbative QCD.) It has been argued\nthat the RHIC data demonstrate scaling behavior in a broad kinematic\nregion in p\u22a5 38,135 . A very similar scaling is seen in the string percolotion framework 136 . In Ref. 39 , a novel mechanism for nuclear collisions\nwas suggested, where, due to quantum evolution of saturation effects in\nthe wavefunctions of the incoming nuclei, the p\u22a5 window, where geometric scaling holds, may extend to p\u22a5 > Q2s /\u039bQCD . This mechanism has\nprecisely the same origin as the geometric scaling discussed at length\nin Sect. 3.4 and which was suggested in Sect. 4.3 to be an explanation the large scaling window observed in Deeply Inelastic Scattering at\nHERA. As a consequence of geometric scaling, the p\u22a5 distributions in\nAA-collisions at RHIC (and more strikingly at LHC) scale with centrality \u221d Npart . The boundary of this region is estimated to be \u223c 4 GeV at\nRHIC and \u223c 9 GeV at LHC. The CGC+geometric scaling picture therefore explains the qualitative behavior of the quenching seen in central\ncollisions at RHIC 137 . For peripheral collisions, the saturation scale is\nsmall: the window for geometric scaling shrinks and the binary scaling\nof pQCD is restored just as observed in the data.\nThis CGC+geometric scaling picture of Ref. 39 is in striking contrast\nto the QGP+energy loss description of the quenching of spectra seen in\ncentral AA-collisions 138 . The two scenarios, at face value, make very\ndifferent predictions for quenching in d-Au collisions. The former predicts\nquenching in roughly the same p\u22a5 range with the centrality dependence\n(Npart )1/2 ; the latter predicts a \"Cronin-enhancement\" just as seen in\nlower energy p-A collisions. However, multiple-scattering of the Cronin\nvariety is also, in principle, present in the CGC picture. The magnitude\nof this effect must be quantified before we rush to any conclusions about\nthe RHIC data. We will discuss p-A collisions further in Section 5.5.\nWe now turn to the theoretical interpretation of the RHIC v2 data\nin the CGC approach. It is clear from Fig. 28 that our result for v2 contributes only about 50% of the measured v2 for various centralities. Our\np\u22a5 distributions also clearly disagree with experiment 139,140 . Naively,\none could argue that the classical Yang-Mills approach is only applicable at early times so additional contributions to v2 will arise from later\nstages of the collision. While there is merit in this statement, it is also\nproblematic as we will discuss below. The reason the situation is complex is as follows. We observed that it takes a long time \u03c4 \u223c R to obtain\na significant elliptic flow in the CGC. At these late times, one would ex-\n\n95\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\n96\n\n21:22\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Review Volume\n\nQGP3 \u0307final \u0307web\n\nThe Color Glass Condensate and High Energy Scattering in QCD\n\npect that the classical approach would be inapplicable due to the rapid\nexpansion of the system. On the other hand, we have seen that v2 in\nthe classical approach is dominated by soft modes which are strongly\ninteracting and don't linearize even at time scales \u03c4 \u223c R. Clearly, the\nsoft modes cannot be treated as on-shell partons even at times \u03c4 \u223c R!\nThis conceptual problem will be discussed further in Section 5.4. The\nobservation in Ref. 118 that the CGC alone is unable to explain the low\np\u22a5 behavior of the RHIC v2 data is, thus far, the strongest argument\nfor the importance of final state effects at RHIC.\nFinally, we note that v2 is extracted from a variety of techniques-in\naddition to a reaction plane method, two and four particle cumulant\nanalyses are used 141 . As we noted previously, the CGC p\u22a5 distribution at high p\u22a5 decays as 1/p2\u22a5 while the data is flat up to p\u22a5 \u223c 10\nGeV. Recently, non-flow two particle correlations in the CGC model\nwere suggested as an explanation of the v2 data 142 . It is unclear at\npresent whether non-flow correlations can explain other features of the\nmeasured azimuthal anisotropy. In the approach reported previously, a\nprocedure very similar to the experimental approach can be followed and\ntwo and four particle correlations can be determined 120 . It is not yet\nclear whether the results of this study would affect our above conclusion\nabout the relevance of final state effects in heavy ion collisions.\n5.4. Equilibration and the Quark Gluon Plasma\nAn outstanding issue in the physics of heavy ion collisions is whether\nthe hot and dense matter formed equilibrates to form a Quark Gluon\nPlasma (QGP). Hydrodynamic models, which assume local equilibrium,\nhave been used to study the evolution of the QGP and are successful\nin describing some of the data at RHIC 143 . It is however not easy to\nshow from first principles that thermalization does occur in the extreme\nconditions of a high energy heavy ion collision. Even though the initial\ndensity is very high, the system is expanding and becoming dilute very\nrapidly; moreover, if the momenta of the gluons is large, asymptotic\nfreedom dictates that the cross-section of the gluons is small.\nIn the CGC approach, we have argued that the energy densities\nright after the collision are very high-\u03b5 \u223c 10 GeV/fm3 at RHIC and\n\u03b5 \u223c 60 GeV/fm3 at LHC energies. These energy densities are formed\nvery rapidly after the collision-about \u03c4f ormation = 0.4 fm for RHIC and\n\u03c4f ormation = 0.25 fm at LHC using the values of Qs from the GolecBiernat parametrization. At the high energies of interest, a heavy ion\ncollision in the classical picture is boost invariant s . The dynamics of\nparticle production at early times is therefore purely transverse. Consider\ns This assumption is modified by quantum effects-however, at central rapidities, boost\ninvariance is a good approximation.\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\n21:22\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Review Volume\n\nQGP3 \u0307final \u0307web\n\n97\n\nThe Color Glass Condensate and High Energy Scattering in QCD\n\na narrow slice in space-time rapidity, around the central rapidity \u03b7 =\n0. Partons with any significant longitudinal momentum pz will not be\nfound in this slice (over time scales of interest)-they have only transverse\nmomentum p\u22a5 \u223c Qs . Our classical dynamics only describe the initial\ntransverse dynamics of partons. In Fig. 27, we see that at a time of\n\u223c 20\u039bs0 \u03c4 (\u223c 2.8 fm), \u03b5 = Txx + Tyy . This suggests that the partons\nthat were strongly interacting in the transverse plane are free-streaming\nby this time.\nIt is unlikely however that the classical approach is valid at these late\ntimes. Shortly after partons are formed \u223c 1/Qs , they begin to scatter\noff each other and off the transverse plane. The physics of this process\nis not contained in the classical picture. A first guess is to see if small\nangle elastic 2 \u2192 2 scattering will lead to thermalization. Analytical\nestimates 144 suggest and numerical solutions of the Boltzmann equation\nconfirm 145 that the time scale for equilibration due to small angle\n\u221a\nscattering is \u223c exp(1/ \u03b1s )/Qs parametrically. In practice, this time\nscale is not much smaller than the lifetime of the system. Also, as pointed\nout in Ref. 146 , the pressure computed from these simulations is smaller\nthan that of an equilibrated QGP.\nIt was suggested by Baier et al. 34 that inelastic 2 \u2192 3 scattering\nmay provide the dominant mechanism driving the system towards equilibrium. Naive power counting suggests that this process is suppressed\nrelative to elastic scattering by a power of \u03b1s -however, the 2 \u2192 3 process\nis more efficient in re-distributing momenta and changing particle number. This scenario for thermalization, termed \"bottom-up\" on account\nof our particular initial conditions, can be outlined briefly as follows. As\nwe discussed previously, the classical fields can be linearized into partons\nfor \u03c4 > (Qs )\u22121 . The parton distribution can be expressed as in Eq. 5.24\nwith the functional form of the distribution given in Eq. 5.25. This description, in weak coupling, is valid (parametrically) up to a proper time\n\u03c4 \u223c (\u03b1s )\u22123/2 /Qs . This is the time at which, on account of the longitudinal expansion, the occupation number of partons f < 1. In a small slice\nin rapidity, pz \u223c 1/\u03c4 which is small for \u03c4 > 1/Qs . However, pz is built\nup gradually through random multiple scattering: p2z = m2D Ncoll , where\nmD is the Debye mass and Ncoll is the collision rate. Simple estimates\nof these give self-consistently pz \u223c Qs /(Qs \u03c4 )1/3 . Thus even though pz\ndecreases with \u03c4 , it does so at a slower rate than given by free streaming.\nThe occupation number of the hard gluons (with p\u22a5 \u223c Qs ) is then\nf=\n\ndNh\n1 (Qs \u03c4 )1/3\nQ3s\n\u2248\n,\n2\n\u03b1s (Qs \u03c4 ) Q2s\nQs\ndzSA Qs pz\n\u22123/2\n\n(5.31)\n\nwhich gives f < 1 for \u03c4 > \u03b1s\n/Qs . This estimate was made assuming\none had only elastic 2 \u2192 2 scattering. There is also inelastic 2 \u2192 3\nscattering going on but the number of these soft gluons Ns << Nh at\nthese times. When f < 1, this inequality continues to hold but the soft\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\n98\n\n21:22\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Review Volume\n\nQGP3 \u0307final \u0307web\n\nThe Color Glass Condensate and High Energy Scattering in QCD\n\ngluons begin to dominate the contribution to the Debye screening mass.\nOne obtains Ns \u223c Nh at Qs \u03c4 = (\u03b1s )\u22125/2 .\nFor Qs \u03c4 > (\u03b1s )\u22125/2 , most of the gluons are soft. These collide frequently with each other and achieve an equilibrated distribution with a\ntemperature T . However, there are still some hard gluons left which continue to transfer energy to the soft gluons thereby acting as a heat bath.\nIndeed, as a consequence, the temperature of the soft gluons increases\nlinearly initially even though the system as a whole is expanding. The\ntemperature finally stops increasing when the hard gluons have lost all\ntheir energy. This happens at a time Qs \u03c4 = (\u03b1s )\u221213/5 at a temperature\n2/5\nof T = \u03b1s Qs . The temperature subsequently decreases as \u03c4 \u22121/3 as\none would expect for a fluid undergoing one dimensional expansion.\nThe bottom-up scenario is an attractive one and the authors in\nRef. 134 have show that the centrality dependence of the RHIC experimental data can be fit successfully. Nevertheless, a fully successful\napplication of the idea to phenomenology is still remote. For the various\nstages of this scenario to be realized, \u03b1s must be very small-likely, much\nsmaller than may be realized at RHIC and perhaps even LHC energies.\nIn the bottom-up scenario itself, the final temperature and the equilibration time are not determined up to a constant-however this number\ncan in principle be determined within the theoretical framework itself. A\nnumber that needs to be determined externally is the liberation coefficient cN . As we described previously in section 5.2.3 and 5.2.4, we obtain\ncN = 0.3 \u2212 0.5 depending on what Qs is. From empirical considerations,\na larger value cN \u223c 1 is favored in the bottom-up picture 134 . Even for a\nfavorable choice of parameters which fit the data, one finds \u03c4equil \u2248 R/2\nwhere R = 6.8 fm is the radius of a Gold nucleus. While still smaller\nthan the size of the system, a necessary condition for thermalization, it\nis not smaller by a large enough margin to make it appear inevitable.\nThe long equilibration times discussed here are problematic for understanding the RHIC data on v2 . Hydrodynamical models that fit the\ndata require early thermalization times of \u03c4equil \u223c 0.6 fm. The v2 generated by the CGC alone is not sufficient to explain the data. The correct\nway to treat the theoretical problem may be as follows. Hard modes\nwith k\u22a5 \u2265 \u039bs linearize on very short time scales \u03c4 \u223c 1/Qs . Their subsequent evolution is treated incorrectly in the classical approach, which\nhas them free streaming in the transverse plane. In actuality, as discussed here, they are scattering off each other via elastic gg \u2192 gg and\ninelastic gg \u2194 ggg collisions which drive them towards an isotropic distribution 34 . This dynamics would indeed provide an additional preequilibrium contribution to v2 and is calculable. An effect to consider\nhere would be the possible screening of infrared divergences in the hard\nscattering by the time dependent classical field. More complicated is the\neffect of these hard modes on the classical dynamics of the soft modes\nand on their possible modification of the contribution of the latter to v2 .\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\n21:22\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Review Volume\n\nQGP3 \u0307final \u0307web\n\nThe Color Glass Condensate and High Energy Scattering in QCD\n\nOne has here a little explored dynamical analog to the interplay of hard\nparticle and soft classical modes in the kinetic theory of Hard Thermal\nLoops 21,147 . The overlap between the classical field and Boltzmann\npictures in this context has been discussed recently in Ref. 35 . A practical issue of interest is to use the results of the classical field simulations\nas the initial input to parton cascade models which simulate the later\nstages of heavy ion collisions 148 .\n5.5. p\u2013A & Peripheral A\u2013A collisions at RHIC and LHC\nProton-Nucleus collisions at RHIC and LHC will provide an excellent\nprobe of the properties of the CGC. Deuteron-Gold collisions with the\n\u221a\ncenter of mass energy of s = 200 GeV/nucleon at RHIC started in\nJanuary 2003 and Proton-Nucleus collisions are an important part of\nthe program at the upcoming LHC collider at CERN 87 . A big difference between p/D-A collisions and A-A collisions is that final state\ninteractions are more important in the latter than in the former. Thus\np/D-A collisions provide an important benchmark to disentangle novel\nphenomena such as the Quark Gluon Plasma, which arise as a consequence of strong final state interactions, from initial state phenomena\nwhich may result from the Color Gluon Condensate.\nA case in point is the remarkable observation of the suppression of the\nsingle particle spectra, as a function of p\u22a5 , in Au-Au collisions relative\n\u221a\nto that in pp-collisions (per binary collision) at s = 130 GeV/nucleon\nand 200 GeV/nucleon 137 . An interpretation is that high p\u22a5 partons\ntraversing a QGP suffer significant energy loss resulting in fewer high\np\u22a5 partons 149 . If correct, the observed suppression is evidence that a\nQGP has been created in high energy heavy ion collisions. In contrast,\nin p/D-Au collsions, it is argued that one will see the Cronin effectthe ratio of d-Au relative to pp-collisions will show an enhancement at\nmoderate p\u22a5 , peaking at p\u22a5 \u223c 3 \u2212 4 GeV before going down to unity\nat larger p\u22a5 138 . The argument is that energy loss in the \"cold matter\"\nof d-Au collisions is quite small and the p\u22a5 broadening due to multiple\nscattering causes the Cronin effect. On the other hand, if no Cronin effect\nis seen and a suppression is seen instead it may be an indication that\ninitial state effects are responsible for the phenomenon in both d-Au and\nAu-Au collisions.\nIn this section, we will briefly summarize recent work on protonnucleus collisions in the CGC framework. Proton-Nucleus collisions in\nthis framework were first considered by Kovchegov and Mueller 27 .\nThe proton in this case was modelled by a gauge invariant gluonic\ncurrent. They showed that one obtains a Glauber-type formula with\na saturation scale Qs (of the nucleus) for the inclusive gluon crosssection. The problem was looked at in more detail in Ref. 40 . The\nproblem of proton-nucleus scattering was considered in a manner sim-\n\n99\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\n100\n\n21:22\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Review Volume\n\nQGP3 \u0307final \u0307web\n\nThe Color Glass Condensate and High Energy Scattering in QCD\n\nilar to the classical fields treatment of nuclear scattering 29,30 , except\nnow they introduced two saturation scales Qs1 and Qs2 for the nucleon and nucleus respectively with Qs1 << Qs2 . They were able to\nobtain analytical solutions for classical gluon production in the regions\nk\u22a5 > Qs2 > Qs1 as well as for Qs2 > k\u22a5 > Qs1 . In the former, one ob4\ntains dN/d2 k\u22a5 d2 b \u221d Q2s1 Q2s2 /k\u22a5\nwhile in the latter case they obtained\nk 2\n2\n2\n2\n2\ndN/d\u22a5 d b \u221d Qs1 ln(k\u22a5 /Qs1 )/k\u22a5\n. In this latter regime, one is solving\n2\nthe classical equations to all orders in Q2s2 /k\u22a5\n. No analytical solution\nis available for k\u22a5 < Qs1 < Qs2 , even when k\u22a5 > \u039bQCD . The classical problem discussed here can also be formulated numerically 119 .\nThe k\u22a5 dependence of the two kinematical regions is seen clearly in the\nnumerical result. It was also argued in Ref. 40 that since the rapidity\ndistributions, for fixed k\u22a5 , in one or the other regime are so different,\nthese rapidity distributions could be used to isolate the Renormalization\nGroup (RG)-evolution of the partons in both the proton and the large\nnucleus.\nThe proton fragmentation region provides an excellent probe of the\nCGC. Final states measured in this region are produced by the scattering\nof high x partons in the proton off very small x partons in the nucleus.\nThe scattering can be described as the convolution of the probability to\nfind a quark in the proton q(x1 , Q2 ) times the probability for the quark to\nscatter off the classical field of the nucleus characterized by a saturation\nscale Qs2 (x2 ) 41,42 . As discussed in Ref. 40 , the k\u22a5 distribution for this\nscattering is modified from the usual tree level pQCD distribution-this\nmodified distribution, when convolved with the appropriate fragmentation functions will be reflected in hadronic final states 41,150 . Electromagnetic final states such as photons and di-leptons are a particularly\nsensitive probe of saturation dynamics in the proton fragmentation region 42 . Interestingly, the modified p\u22a5 distributions lead to p\u22a5 broadening of the final state and the Cronin effect 41,42 . This effect is also\nseen in other (dipole) models of saturation 151 .\nThough the CGC picture gives rise to the Cronin effect (which can\nbe represented by multiple scattering tree level diagrams), quantum effects in the wavefunction can modify this picture significantly. In sections 4.3 and 5.3 respectively, we discussed the CGC+geometric scaling\nmechanism which was first applied to understand the HERA DIS data\nand subsequently the suppression of p\u22a5 spectra of charged hadrons in\nAu-Au collisions at RHIC. In the geometric scaling regime, the anomalous dimensions for the evolution are very close to BFKL anomalous\ndimensions 46,94 -this change in the anomalous dimensions (from the\nDGLAP one) is what causes the suppression of the p\u22a5 spectra in the\ninitial state CGC scenario. A similar suppression must then persist in\np/D-A collisions. In Ref. 39 , it is predicted that the dependence of semihard processes on the number of participating nucleons of the nucleus\n\n\fOctober 22, 2018\n\n21:22\n\nWSPC/Trim Size: 9in x 6in for Review Volume\n\nQGP3 \u0307final \u0307web\n\nThe Color Glass Condensate and High Energy Scattering in QCD\n\n101\n\nAu 1/2\nin D-A collisions will be \u223c (Npart\n) . The number of participants are\ndetermined a la the Glauber calculation of Kharzeev and Nardi 36 . Thus\n\nmore quantitatively, the suppression in D-Au collisions (relative to pp )\n\u221a\nat s = 200 GeV/nucleon due to the geometric scaling initial state effect\ntranslates into a 25-30% of moderately high p\u22a5 particles in the top 15%\ncentrality range. This conclusion will be modified by the Cronin final\nstate scatterings of Refs. 41,42 \u2013these will change the behavior and one\nmay even recover an enhancement. A quantitative calculation including\nboth geometric scaling and final state scattering is urgently required.\nVery recently, in Ref. 152 , quantitative predictions (along the lines\nof the qualitative ones in Ref. 40 ) were made for hadron multiplicities\nin Deuteron-Gold scattering at RHIC-in particular for the rapidity and\ncentrality dependence. The results of the current Deuteron-Gold run\nshould therefore help determine whether a Color Glass Condensate is\nformed already at the moderately high energies at RHIC.\nAn important part of the RHIC program is the study of peripheral\nnuclear collisions. Very intense electromagnetic fields are created at these\nenergies and a variety of photon-photon and photon-Pomeron final states\ncan be studied 153 . Of particular interest to us is inclusive and diffractive QQ\u0304-in the color field of a nucleus 154 . The problem is analogous to\nthe photo-production of heavy quark pairs in Deeply Inelastic Scattering. The transverse momentum and invariant mass distribution of quark\npairs can be shown to depend sensitively on the saturation scale Qs .\nThus ultra-peripheral nuclear collisions provide an independent method\nto extract properties of Color Glass Condensate.\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank our colleagues and friends, J.
