Most typically, one derives an \"effective\" reduced\nHamiltonian Heff from a given microscopic Horig by some approximation procedure.\nIn one of applications of such an approach in nuclear physics, people map the fermions\ngoverned by a complicated Hamiltonian Horig ) on a bona fide equivalent bosonic system controlled by Heff [1].\nEven though the latter recipe may lead to non-Hermitian Heff in general, the au\u2020\nthors of the review [1] emphasized that the work with Heff 6= Heff\nneed not contradict\n\nthe principles of Quantum Mechanics. A core of the message lies in the observation\nthat one is free to introduce an alternative metric \u0398 6= I in Hilbert space. This\n\noperator defines the new scalar product and the new norm in our Hilbert space in\nsuch a way that\n\u2020\nHeff\n= \u0398 Heff \u0398\u22121 ,\n\n\u0398 = \u0398\u2020 > 0 .\n\n(1)\n\nIn this language, our Hamiltonian may be called \"quasi-Hermitian\" (the word meaning just Hermitian and, hence, physical with respect to the new metric). It becomes\nallowed to represent an observable (energy). Let us only note that it is in fact just\nconventional to call H \"the operator of energy\" since it may also be interpreted as\n\"an occupation number\", etc. After all, the latter re-classification is not too unusual,\nsay, within the so called superymmetric quantum mechanics [2].\nIn the late nineties, a renewed interest in the quasi-Hermitian non-Hermitian\nmodels has been inspired by Bessis [3] and by Bender and Boettcher [4] who revealed\nthat one of important non-Hermitian models in field theory seemed to possess the\ndiscrete and real \"bound-state-like\" spectrum. This hypothesis (which has rigorously\nbeen confirmed a few years later [5]) opened the question of the possible physical\ninterpretation of the model because its Heff only happened to satisfy a weaker form\nof eq. (1),\n\u2020\nHeff\n= P Heff P \u22121 ,\n\nP \u22121 = P = P \u2020 ,\n\n(2)\n\nwith the role of an indefinite \"pseudo-metric\" played by the operator of parity [6].\nIn the latter new family of models (conventionally called, for some historical\nreasons [7], PT \u2212symmetric) people only succeeded in constructing physical met-\n\n\u2020\nric \u0398 very recently [8]. One must remember that Heff 6= Heff\nso that the stan-\n\ndard Schr\u00f6dinger equation must be considered together with the parallel Hermitian-\n\n1\n\n\fconjugate problem,\n\u2020\nHeff\n|\u03c8ii = E |\u03c8ii.\n\nHeff |\u03c8i = E |\u03c8i,\n\n(3)\n\nMoreover, many PT \u2212symmetric models proved to behave, in many a respect, against\n\nour current intuition [9]. Hence, up to a few partial differential exceptions [10], people\n\nprefer working with the one-dimensional effective Hamiltonians. Hence, it is not too\nsurprising that the constructions of the correct positive definite metric \u0398 found their\nmost transparent presentations in exactly solvable models. For example, one may\nrecollect ref. [11] where an entirely elementary \"schematic\" square-well model of\nrefs. [12] has been used and studied and where its measurable and physical aspects\nhave been described in detail.\nOur present letter was immediately motivated by some specific features of the\ntransition P \u2192 \u0398 in the context of coupled-channel Schr\u00f6dinger equations, perceived\n\nhere as residing somewhere in between the unsolvable (=\"realistic\") and solvable\nextremes. Their introduction may be based on various physical assumptions as well as\non some formal considerations in representation theory [13] and/or on constructions\nbelonging to relativistic quantum mechanics [14] etc.\n\n2\n\nCoupled-channel problems\n\nIn some of the contemporary papers devoted to PT \u2212symmetric Quantum Mechanics\n\n[15] the operator P of eq. (2) does not coincide with parity and it need not even be\nchosen as involutive. For this reason, let us now change its symbol from P, say, to \u03b8.\nAlthough the rigorous mathematical specification of this \u03b8 6= \u03b8\u22121 need not be easy\n\nin general [16], a generic requirement is that this auxiliary indefinite pseudo-metric\n\noperator as well as the related Hamiltonian Heff remain sufficiently elementary [17].\n\n2.1\n\nTwo particles coupled in a one-dimensional deep box\n\nThe most elementary coupled-channel model are, undoubtedly, the two-channel models and, in particular, their one-dimensional example\n\uf8eb\n\nHeff = \uf8ed\n\n2\n\nd\n\u2212 dx\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n2\n\nd\n\u2212 dx\n2\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8 + Veff ,\n\n\uf8eb\n\nVeff = \uf8ed\n\nVa (x)\n\nWb (x)\n\nWa (x)\n\nVb (x)\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\n\n(4)\n\nwritten in units h\u0304 = 2m = 1. These operators lie somewhere in between the ordinary\nand partial differential ones and offer a certain combination of merits of the solvability\n\n2\n\n\f(so characteristic for ordinary differential equations) with a richer structure of wave\nfunctions.\nIn what follows we shall only search for such two-channel bound states |\u03c8i which\n\nhave the standard asymptotic Dirichlet boundary conditions mimicked by their suitable large\u2212L approximation\n\uf8eb\n\nh\u00b1L|\u03c8i = \uf8ed\n\nh\u00b1L|\u03c8a i\nh\u00b1L|\u03c8b i\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\n\n\uf8eb\n\n=\uf8ed\n\n0\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8.\n\n(5)\n\nIn this setting, a non-trivial core of our message will lie in the assumption that\nwhile the character of the spectrum {En } will be assumed \"entirely standard\" (i.e.,\nreal, discrete and bounded below), the potential term itself will possess an unusual,\nasymmetric and manifestly non-Hermitian form with Va 6= Va\u2020 , etc.\n\n2.2\n\nModels with \u03b8\u2212pseudo-Hermiticity and PT \u2212symmetry\n\nOur key motivation stems form the success of a number of the ordinary differential\nnon-Hermitian Hamiltonians which were offered within the framework of the so called\nquasi-Hermitian [1], PT \u2212symmetric [4] or P\u2212pseudo-Hermitian [18] Quantum Mechanics. In this context, rather surprisingly, coupled-channel models were not yet\nstudied in sufficient detail. Our present letter has been written just to fill this gap.\nFor the sake of a maximal transparency of our forthcoming arguments we shall\nviolate the current Hermiticity as drastically as possible and postulate the \u03b8\u2212pseudoHermiticity property\n\u2020\nHeff\n= \u03b8 Heff \u03b8\u22121\n\n\u03b8 = \u03b8\u2020\n\n(6)\n\nusing the following parity-dependent (or, if you wish, generalized-parity-dependent)\npseudo-metric\n\uf8eb\n\n\u03b8 = \u03b8\u2020 = \uf8ed\n\n0 P\n\nP\n\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\u03b8\u22121 = \uf8ed\n\n\uf8f8,\n\n0\nP \u22121\n\nP \u22121\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8.\n\n(7)\n\nAs long as these operators commute with the kinetic (i.e., differential) part of our\nHeff (4), the related \u03b8\u2212pseudo-Hermiticity condition (6) degenerates to the following\ntwo P\u2212pseudo-Hermiticity relations and one definition,\nWa\u2020 = PWa P \u22121 ,\n\nWb\u2020 = PWb P \u22121 ,\n\nVb = P \u22121 Va\u2020 P .\n\n(8)\n\nIn our present note just a \"minimal\" model will be considered, with the re-scaled\ncoordinate x [such that L = 1 in eq.

The remaining two equations\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\n\n\u2212 sin \u03ba\u2217\n\nsin \u03ba\n\n\u03ba cos \u03ba \u03ba\u2217 cos \u03ba\u2217\n\n\uf8f6\uf8eb\n\uf8f8\uf8ed\n\nA\nA\u2217\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\n\n=0\n\n(13)\n\ndefine one of these complex coefficients. The nontriviality of this solution is guaranteed by the elementary secular equation Re (\u03ba\u22121 tan \u03ba) = 0. The later condition has\nthe simplified equivalent form\ns sin 2s + t sinh 2t = 0\n\n(14)\n\nwith the structure of solutions known from the single-well constructions [19],\ns = sn =\n\n(n + 1)\u03c0\n+ (\u22121)n \u03b5n ,\n2\n\nn = 0, 1, . . .\n\nwhere quantities \u03b5n remain small and positive at large n or small\n\n(15)\n\u221a\n\nY Z. In contrast\n\nto the single-well case, the present real energy levels En = s2n \u2212 Y Z/(4s2n ) are doubly\nq\n\ndegenerate since t in the above-mentioned ratio A/B = 2st/Y = \u00b1 Z/Y may\n\nacquire both signs,\n\n\uf8eb\n\n|\u03c8n(\u03c3) i = \uf8ed\n\n|\u03c6n i *\n\n\u221a\n\n|\u03c6n i * \u03c3\n\nZ\n\u221a\n\nY\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8,\n\n\u03c3 = \u00b11,\n\nn = 0, 1, . . . .\n\n(16)\n\nThe construction is completed.\n\n4\n4.1\n\nDiscussion\nThe existence of the set of two commuting observables\n\nThe key merit of our choice of the example (9) is methodical since its Hamiltonian\nHeff commutes with the operator which might play the role of an independent spinlike observable in our system,\n\uf8eb\n\n0\n\n\u03a9=\uf8ed q\nY /Z\n\nq\n\nZ/Y\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8.\n\n(17)\n\nIndeed, the \u03b8\u2212pseudo-Hermiticity \u03a9\u2020 = \u03b8\u03a9\u03b8\u22121 is readily verified as one of the welcome intuitive arguments supporting the possible consistency of such an interpretation.\n\n5\n\n\fWe saw that both our pseudo-Hermitian candidates H = Heff and \u03a9 for observables possess the real spectra (remember: just two points \u03c3 = \u00b11 in the latter case),\n\nat not too large couplings Y \u2265 0 and Z \u2265 0 at least (more precisely, at all of them\n\u221a\nsuch that Y Z < Zcrit \u2248 4.48 [12]). In this regime, our wave functions may be per-\n\nceived as functions of the (real) variables E (or, equivalently, n) and \u03c3. From such a\npoint of view their set becomes complete once the operators in question (i.e., H and\n\u03a9 in our model) form a complete set of commuting operators in a given indefinite\nmetric.\n\n4.2\n\nThe basis in Hilbert space for the degenerate spectrum\n\nIn the majority of studies concerned with PT \u2212symmetric quantum mechanics the\n\nenergy spectra happen to be non-degenerate. In contrast, bound states are usually\nclassified by more quantum numbers in practice [1, 20]. In this sense, the degeneracy\nof energies and the emergence of the second quantum number \u03c3 might further enhance\n\nthe pragmatic as well as theoretical appeal of our present example.\nIn the present unusual non-Hermitian setting, the eigenvectors of H \u2020 and \u03a9\u2020 (or,\nequivalently, the left eigenvectors of H and \u03a9) will be also needed. We must solve\nthe following extended set of Schr\u00f6dinger equations,\nH |E, \u03c3i = E |E, \u03c3i,\n\n\u03a9 |E, \u03c3i = \u03c3 |E, \u03c3i,\n\nhhE, \u03c3| H = E hhE, \u03c3|,\n\nhhE, \u03c3| \u03a9 = \u03c3 hhE, \u03c3| .\n\nFortunately, the latter pair only means that\nH \u2020 |E, \u03c3ii = E \u2217 |E, \u03c3ii,\n\n\u03a9\u2020 |E, \u03c3ii = \u03c3 \u2217 |E, \u03c3ii\n\nso that, due to the pseudo-Hermiticity (6) and due to the independence and completeness of our set of wave functions (be it proved or assumed) we have\n|E, \u03c3ii = \u03b8 |E \u2217 , \u03c3 \u2217 i qE\u03c3 ,\n\nE = E1 , E2 , . . . ,\n\n\u03c3 = \u00b11.\n\n(18)\n\nWe are just left with a freedom in a complex normalization constant in the explicit\ndefinition of all the missing solutions.\nNow, it is easy to derive the biorthogonality relations among our wave functions,\nhhE \u2032 , \u03c3 \u2032 |E, \u03c3i(E \u2032 \u2212 E) = 0,\n\nhhE \u2032 , \u03c3 \u2032 |E, \u03c3i(\u03c3 \u2032 \u2212 \u03c3) = 0.\n\n6\n\n\fWe see that only the diagonal overlaps may remain non-vanishing and enter the\ncompleteness relations\nI=\n\nX\nE, \u03c3\n\n|E, \u03c3i\n\n1\nhhE, \u03c3|\nhhE, \u03c3|E, \u03c3i\n\nas well as the following two spectral representation formulae,\nX\n\nH=\n\nE, \u03c3\n\n|E, \u03c3i\n\nE\nhhE, \u03c3|,\nhhE, \u03c3|E, \u03c3i\n\n\u03a9=\n\nX\nE, \u03c3\n\n|E, \u03c3i\n\n\u03c3\nhhE, \u03c3|\nhhE, \u03c3|E, \u03c3i\n\n(19)\n\nwhere the later one is rather formal of course.\n\n5\n\nThe transition from indefinite \u03b8 to physical \u0398\n\nIn terms of the metric \u0398, the bound-state coupled-channel wave functions of our\nmodel acquire the standard probabilistic interpretation. Indeed, the scalar product\n(|\u03c81 i \u2299 |\u03c82 i) = h\u03c81 | \u0398 |\u03c82i = h\u03c81 |\u03c82 i(physical)\ngenerates the norm, ||\u03c8|| =\n\n(20)\n\nq\n\nh\u03c8|\u03c8i(physical), and enables us to treat all the quasi-\n\nHermitian operators A with the property A\u2020 = \u0398 A \u0398\u22121 as observables. Such a usage\n\nof this word makes good sense because the expectation values h\u03c8| A |\u03c8i(physical) are\n\nmathematically unambiguously defined,\n\n(|\u03c81 i \u2299 |A \u03c82 i) \u2261 (|A \u03c81 i \u2299 |\u03c82 i) .\n\n(21)\n\nIn our particular square-well model just a re-interpretation of our \u03b8\u2212pseudo-Hermitian\nHamiltonian Heff and spin \u03a9 as quasi-Hermitian operators with respect to \u0398 is\nneeded.\n\n5.1\n\nA formula for the metric\n\nLet us recollect that we started our considerations from a given (i.e., with a strong\npreference, very simple) indefinite metric (i.e., pseudo-metric) operator \u03b8 and from\na \u03b8\u2212pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonian Heff [cf. eq. (6)]. Now, having performed all\nthe constructions of the bound states we are left with the ultimate task of finding\nthe physical metric, i.e., a Hermitian and positive definite solution \u0398 = \u0398\u2020 > 0 of\neq. (1). In terms of the above formulae (19) it is easy to see, immediately, that we\nmust have\n\u0398=\n\nX\n\nE, \u03c3, F, \u03c4\n\n|F, \u03c4 ii RF,\u03c4, E, \u03c3 hhE, \u03c3|\n\n7\n\n\fwhere the (in general, fairly ambiguous [1]) choice of the matrix R must remain\ncompatible with eq. (1) and with its analogue for \u03a9. This remains true if and only if\nRE,\u03c3, F, \u03c4 (E \u2217 \u2212 F ) = 0,\n\nRE,\u03c3, F, \u03c4 (\u03c3 \u2212 \u03c4 ) = 0.\n\nOnce the spectrum of energies is assumed real we arrive at the compact formula\n\u0398=\n\nX\nE, \u03c3\n\n|E, \u03c3ii SE, \u03c3 hhE, \u03c3|\n\n(22)\n\nwhich represents the menu of all the eligible pseudo- and metrics parametrized by\nthe infinite sequence of the non-vanishing parameters SE, \u03c3 where \u03c3 = \u00b11 and, by\nassumption, E = E0 , E1 , . . . are all real. Easily we also deduce that\n\u0398\u22121 =\n\nX\nE, \u03c3\n\n|E, \u03c3i\n\n1/SE, \u03c3\nhE, \u03c3| .\nhE, \u03c3|E, \u03c3ii * hhE, \u03c3|E, \u03c3i\n\nThe obligatory invertibility and Hermiticity of \u0398 is guaranteed when all the parameters SE, \u03c3 remain real and non-vanishing. Finally, its positivity (i.e., tractability as\na physical metric) will be achieved whenever all SE, \u03c3 remain positive.\n\n5.2\n\nQuasi-parity\n\nIn our particular model of section 3, the reality of the energies was comparatively\neasy to prove. In such a situation, people usually work with eq. (18) and employ\nvery particular q = qE\u03c3 = \u00b11, calling such a \"new quantum number\" quasi-parity\n\n[6, 21] or charge [22]. It enters the formula\nhhE, \u03c3|E, \u03c3i = qE\u03c3 hE, \u03c3| \u03b8 |E, \u03c3i ,\n\nE = E1 , E2 , . . . ,\n\n\u03c3 = \u00b11,\n\nqE\u03c3 = \u00b11.\n\nIn our model where the proportionality of both the components of our wave functions\n|\u03c8n(\u03c3) i to the same single-channel ket |\u03c6n i is a useful artifact, we may insert eqs. (7)\n\nand (16) and arrive at an even more compact relation\n\nhh\u03c8n(\u03c3) |\u03c8n(\u03c3) i = qEn \u03c3 * h\u03c8n(\u03c3) | \u03b8 |\u03c8n(\u03c3) i = \u03c3 qEn \u03c3 * h\u03c6n | P |\u03c6n i *\n\n\u221a\n\n4Y Z .\n\nObviously, we may prescribe the overall sign of this overlap since it is controlled\n\u2022 by \u03c3 = \u00b11, i.e., by the optional sign-convention accepted in eq. (16),\n\u2022 by the overlap h\u03c6n | P |\u03c6n i which \"measures\" the parity of the upper-channel\nwave function in eq. (10) and varies with n = 0, 1, . . .,\n\n8\n\n\f\u2022 and by the quasi-parity qEn \u03c3 = \u00b11 which is our free choice.\nDue to the mere two-by-two matrix character of the spin \u03a9, our key definition (22)\nof the metric may be now further reduced to the sum\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\u221a\n\u221e\nX\nY (SEn, + + SEn, \u2212 )\nY Z (SEn, + \u2212 SEn, \u2212 )\n\uf8f8 h\u03c6n | P\nP |\u03c6n i \uf8ed \u221a\n\u0398=\nY\nZ\n(S\n\u2212\nS\n)\nZ\n(S\n+\nS\n)\nn=0\nEn, +\nEn, \u2212\nEn, +\nEn, \u2212\n\n(23)\n\nwhich is a two-by-two matrix with respect to the spin (17) and depends on the pairs\nof the positive free parameters SEn, \u00b1 > 0.\n\n6\n\nSummary and outlook\n\n6.1\n\nAn efficiency of perturbation expansions\n\nOne of the key advantages of our present model is that the coordinate representation\n(10) of its wave functions is piecewise trigonometric. In addition, perturbation ansatz\nof the form\n\u03b5n =\n\nK\nX\n\nk=1\n\n\"\n\nYZ\n(n + 1)2 \u03c0 2\n\n#k\n\nT (k)\n\n*\n\nX\nt=1\n\nck,t\n(n + 1)t \u03c0 t\n\nmay be used to solve eq. (14) by iterations. Then, for the sufficiently high excitations\n\u221a\nn \u2265 n0 \u226b 1 and/or for the sufficiently small geometric-mean measure Y Z of the\n\nnon-Hermiticity of our Heff we may derive and work, say, with the formula\n2YZ\n4 Y 2Z 2\n\u03b5n =\n+\n(n + 1)3 \u03c0 3 3 (n + 1)5 \u03c0 5\n\"\n\n#\"\n\n1\n1+O\n(n + 1)4\n\n!#\n\nY 3Z 3\n+O\n(n + 1)7\n\n!\n\n(24)\n\nshowing that the convergence in 1/(n + 1) proves extremely rapid.\nIt would be easy to demonstrate that one of the important consequences of the\nsteady growth of the latter quantities with growing Y Z would be a merger and the\nsubsequent complexification of s0 and s1 (or of s2 and s3 etc) at a sufficiently large\nY Z. At this critical point (or rather critical curve Y = const/Z), the reality of\nthe spectrum of our parity-pseudohermitian Heff gets spontaneously broken. This\npossibility opens a number of questions which were not discussed here at all.\nAnother immediate consequence of eq. (24) is that the role of the non-Hermiticity\ndecreases very quickly at the higher excitations. This means that in our present\nmodel a fairly reliable approximation of the metric \u0398(approx) will sufficiently significantly differ from the unit operator \u0398(trivial) = I just in a finite-dimensional subspace\nspanned, say, by the N lowest excitations of the Y = Z = 0 system of the two completely decoupled deep (and, of course, Hermitian) square wells.\n\n9\n\n\f6.2\n\nPoint-interaction models\n\nIn the future, our present choice and study of our example could prove insufficient.\nThen, it need not necessarily be followed just by its various generalizations with\na suitable piece-wise form of the forces. Indeed, with the number of the admissible\ndiscontinuities, one may expect an increase of difficulties of a purely technical nature.\nWe believe that at least a partial reduction of such a obstacle could be achieved when\none switches to the class of the point interactions, say, of the PT \u2212symmetric form\nWa (x) =\n\nMa\nX\n\n[i \u03b1l \u03b4 (x \u2212 al ) \u2212 i \u03b1l \u03b4 (x + al )] ,\n\n(25)\n\nMb\nX\n\n[i \u03b2j \u03b4 (x \u2212 bj ) \u2212 i \u03b2j \u03b4 (x + bjl )] ,\n\n(26)\n\nl=1\n\nWb (x) =\n\nj=1\n\nVa (x) = Vb\u2217 (\u2212x) =\n\nN\nX\n\nn=1\n\ni \u03b3n \u03b4 (x \u2212 gn )\n\n(27)\n\nwith the purely imaginary delta functions located at certain ordered sets of the points\n0 < a1 < . . . < aMa < 1,\n\n0 < b1 < . . . < bMb < 1,\n\n\u22121 < g1 < . . . < gN < 1\n\nand proportional to some real constants \u03b1l , \u03b2j and \u03b3n .\n\nAcknowledgement\nWork partially supported by the grant Nr.
