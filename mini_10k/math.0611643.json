Strooker, Mathematisch Instituut, Universiteit Utrecht, Postbus\n80010, 3508 TA Utrecht, Nederland. E-mail: strooker@math.uu.nl\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nSemidualizing modules were introduced by Foxby [7] and Golod [9] under\nanother name. They can be described as a poor man's projectives, and of\nlate occasion a spate of papers, going in different directions, e.g. [1], [5],\n[10], [8], [15], [17], [11]. There are several reasons why such modules are\nof interest, but a broad question is where they behave like projectives and\nwhere not. However, many studies focus on a more sophisticated concept,\nsemidualizing complexes. Another important feature is to generalize the theory of Gorenstein dimension of Auslander-Bridger [2] by replacing projective\nmodules with semidualizing ones and then resolving by modules which are\ntotally reflexive with respect to a specific such module. A concrete understanding in specific cases of semidualizing modules which are not projective,\nis in its infancy.\nLet us therefore assume we have a fixed such module at our disposal,\nand derive a few simple consequences. In this note we prove an AuslanderBuchsbaum identity for this module. The original one holds for modules of\nfinite projective dimension [16, Cor. 7.1.5], [4, Th. 1.3.3]. We show that\na theory based on semidualizing modules runs largely parallel, and this is\nperhaps the main insight on offer here. We do not claim much originality,\n\n\fjust want to show how much can already be achieved in the classical case,\nfinitely generated modules over a local noetherian ring, by elementary means.\nAcknowledgements 1.1 A few of the facts and directions pursued here\ncame to mind during an exchange of e-mails with Diana White, University\nof Nebraska at Lincoln, for which I thank her. As more often, discussions\nwith my Utrecht colleague Wilberd van der Kallen helped to clarify certain\nissues.\n\n2\n\nSemidualizing modules\n\nThroughout this note, A stands for a fixed commutative noetherian local\nring over which we only consider finitely generated modules. This section\ndeals with two facts I learned from Diana White. In [17, Lemma 2.4], [17,\nTh. 2.5] she proves more in greater generality. For our classical case, we\nprovide easy proofs.\nDefinition 2.1 An A-module C is called semidualizing if\n(i) The natural ringhomomorphism A \u2192 EndA (C) is an isomorphism;\n(ii) ExtiA (C, C) = 0 for every i > 0.\nClearly the ring A is a dualizing module over itself. In what follows,\nC shall always denote a fixed semidualizing A-module. We shall show that\nconditions (i) and (ii) have a strong influence on the additive, covariant left\nexact functor hC = Hom(C, \u2212) where we drop the subscript A. But first we\nuse its contravariant counterpart hC = Hom(\u2212, C) to prove\nLemma 2.2 If C n = U \u2295 V for n \u2265 0, then U = C p and V = C q with\np + q = n.\nHere and elsewhere, given an arbitrary module X, we write X n for the direct\nsum of n of its copies.\nProof Applying hC to the direct sum, we find An = hC (U )\u2295hC (V ). Over\nthe local ring A projectives are free, and we necessarily have a decomposition\nAn = Ap \u2295 Aq with p + q = n. Apply hC once more and write D = hC \u25e6 hC .\nThen D is a covariant additive functor which preserves direct sums. The\nevaluation map from C n to D(C n ) = C n is the identity, which proves the\nlemma.\nLemma 2.3 Any surjection \u03c0 : C n \u2192 C q splits and C n = C p \u2295 C q .\n\n\fProof Putting k for the residue class field of A, we see that k \u2297 \u03c0 is a\nsurjection of finite dimensional vectorspaces, so q \u2264 n. The matrix T which\ndescribes \u03c0 is a q \u00d7 n-matrix with entries in End(C) = A. By Nakayama,\nnot every entry in this matrix can be in the maximal ideal of A, so there\nmust be a unit somewhere. Permuting the direct sums C n and C q we can\nget a unit in the upper left hand corner of the matrix, and by the usual\nelementary transformations obtain a matrix with 1 in the upper left hand\ncorner and zeroes everywhere else in the first row and column. Now \u03c0 splits\noff the first copy of C n and C q . We continue in this way until we obtain a\nmatrix whose first q columns shape a q \u00d7 q-identity matrix, which furnishes\nthe desired splitting.\n\n3\n\nFurther consequences of condition (i)\n\nIn this short section, we concentrate on the functor hC and derive a few\nproperties which condition (i) confers on it.\nA finite exact sequence is called split exact when it is spliced together\nfrom a number of split short exact squences. It is therefore evident that\nthe additive functor hC takes such a sequence where the modules are finite\ndirect sums of copies of C, to a similar split exact sequence where the C's\nare replaced by A's. Suppose however that a finite complex of modules C n\nis taken to a split exact sequence of frees. Then the original complex was\nsplit exact. Indeed, in both sequences the maps are defined by rectangular\nmatrices T with entries in A. If there is another rectangular matrix S with\nST or T S is the appropriate identity matrix, then S defines a splitting\nequally well in both cases.\nHere is another property of hC . For x \u2208 A and M a module, put K for\nthe kernel of the scalar multiplication x : M \u2192 M . Then\nx\n\n0 \u2192 hC (K) \u2192 hC (M ) \u2192 hC (M )\nis exact.\nLooking at associated primes and support [3, Ch. 4-1], one has Ass hC (M ) =\nAss M \u2229 Supp C for any M . Taking M = C, one finds Ass A = Ass C. Thus\nboth these modules have as support Spec A, so have the same dimension.\nMoreover Ass hC (K) = Ass K so that either both these modules are 0 or\nneither. This means that x is a nonzerodivisor in A if and only if it is one\non C. This argument more generally shows that an arbitrary module M\nand hC (M ) have the same nonzerodivisors, as well as the same associated\nprimes, support and dimension.\nIt has been pointed out by S. Sather-Wagstaff that these facts and some\nof the ones to follow, are already collected as \"basic facts\" in [9, p. 68].\nWe shall just prove and use what we need as we go along, with our single\n\n\fsemidualizing module C and not all modules which are totally reflexive with\nrespect to C as in Golod.\n\n4\n\nCondition (ii) comes into play\n\nLet\nC = 0 \u2192 Cs \u2192 Cs\u22121 \u2192 * * * \u2192 C1 \u2192 C0 \u2192 Y \u2192 0\nbe a resolution of the module Y where each Ci is the direct sum of a finite\nnumber of copies of C. We shall prove that the functor hC takes this into a\nfree resolution of hC (Y ).\nIf Y has such a resolution, we say that Y has finite C-dimension and\nC-dim Y is then the smallest such s with Cs 6= 0.\nLemma 4.1 For every Y of finite C-dimension, Exti (C, Y ) = 0 for every\ni > 0. Moreover the evaluation map on Y with respect to C is the identity.\nProof Since the property is clear if C-dim Y = 0, suppose 0 \u2192 C1 \u2192\nC0 \u2192 Y \u2192 0 is short exact. Applying hC to this gives a long exact sequence\nin which (ii) entails that Exti (C, Y ) = 0 for every i > 0. By induction on the\nC-dimension we verify that this is true for every Y of finite C-dimension.\nThe proof of the last statement, that Y is C-reflexive, is also by induction\nand left to the reader.\n[11, Cor. 6.5] contains a sweeping generalization of the Lemma. Working\nwith Auslander and Bass classes, as introduced by Foxby, allows many of the\nconsiderations in this note, and more, to be treated in a wider context. The\npaper just cited provides a convenient framework for this. Still, we persist\nwith our down to earth treatment of the classical case.\nCorollary 4.2 The exactness of any short exact sequence of modules of\nfinite C-dimension is preserved by hC .\nIn fact, this conclusion remains true for any short exact sequence in which\nExt1 (C, X) = 0 for the left hand module X.\nTheorem 4.3 Let C be a resolution of Y as above. Then hC takes this to a\nfree resolution F of hC (Y ). Moreover the projective dimension pd hC (Y ) =\nC- dim Y .\nProof Since C consists of a number of short exact sequences as in the\nprevious corollary spliced together, the first statement of the theorem follows.\nThus pd hC (Y ) \u2264 C-dim Y . According to a classical, half a century old,\nresult of Eilenberg [6, Th. 8] , the resolution 0 \u2192 Fs \u2192 Fs\u22121 \u2192 * * * \u2192 F0 \u2192\nhC (Y ) \u2192 0, the Fi 's finite frees, can be written as a direct sum of a minimal\n\n\ffree resolution K of hC (Y ) and a split exact complex H of frees. Minimal\nmeans that the boundary maps of K vanish when tensored with the residue\nclass field k, and then pd hC (Y ) is the length t of K. Since Fi = Ki \u2295 Hi for\nevery i, the argument in Lemma 2.2 and the fact that the boundary maps in\nC and in F are described by the same matrices with entries in A, show that\nC = U \u2295 V where the first complex is taken to K by hC and the second to\nH. By a remark in section 3, the complex V is itself split, and we remove\nit to find U as a C-resolution of Y . This complex has length t \u2264 s. Since\ns = C-dim Y , one must have s = t.\nThe first part of this theorem is also a consequence of [11, Th. 1]. Diana\nWhite informs me that the second part was proved by her as part of her thesis\nwork and is to appear in a joint preprint with Ryo Takahashi. Consider the\npresent proof as a lowbrow approach.\nTo prepare for the next section we make a quick observation. Let\nK = * * * \u2192 Ks \u2192 Ks\u22121 \u2192 * * * \u2192 K1 \u2192 K0 \u2192 0\nbe a complex whose homology is concentrated in degree 0. Suppose scalar\nmultiplication by x \u2208 A is injective on every chain module Ki , and also\non H0 (K). Then the factor complex K/xK has its homology concentrated\nin degree 0 where it is H0 (K)/xH0 (K). Indeed, the short exact sequence\nof complexes gives rise to a long exact sequence of homology modules. The\nexactness of K in all positive degrees shows that K/xK is exact in all degrees\ngreater than 1. At degree 1 exactness follows from the injectivity of x on\nH0 (K).\n\n5\n\nSetting up for induction\n\nLet x \u2208 A be a nonzerodivisor, which is automatically a nonzerodivisor on\nC, see section 3. We want to show that C/xC is a semidualizing module\nover the local ring A/(x).\nFirst notice that multiplying the isomorphism A \u2192 End(C) with x,\nwe get an isomorphism A/(x) \u2192 End(C)/x End(C). Now applying hC\nx\nto the short exact sequence 0 \u2192 C \u2192 C \u2192 C/xC \u2192 0, we obtain in\nview of Corollary 4.2, another short exact sequence which teaches us that\nhC (C/xC) = End(C)/x End(C) and that every homomorphism f : C \u2192\nC/xC factors through C. Together this shows that the map from A/(x) to\nEndA/(x) (C/xC) is an isomorphism.\nNext we need to see that ExtiA/(x) (C/xC, C/xC) = 0 for i > 0. Take\na free A-resolution K of C. Then multiplying with x is injective on every free chain module Ki and x is also injective on H0 (K) = C. By the\nremark which ends the previous section, we know that K/xK provides a\nfree resolution of the A/(x)-module C/xC. Now ExtiA/(x) (C/xC, C/xC) =\n\n\fH i (HomA/(x) (K/xK, C/xC)) = H i (HomA (K, C/xC)) = ExtiA (C, C/xC).\nThe latter is 0 for all i > 0; this follows from Lemma 4.1 since C-dim C/xC\n= 1. We have proved\nProposition 5.1 Let C be a semidualizing module over the noetherian local\nring A. For every nonzerodivisor in A, the module C/xC is semidualizing\nover A/(x).\nLet Y be a module of finite C-dimension, and suppose x is a nonzerodivisor on Y and on C. For the complex K at the end of the previous section,\nchoose a finite C-resolution of Y . Going through the paces, one sees that\nY /xY has a finite C/xC-dimension as an A/(x)-module.\nx\nApplying Corollary 4.2 to the short exact 0 \u2192 Y \u2192 Y \u2192 Y /xY \u2192 0 one\ngets hC (Y /xY ) = hC (Y )/xhC (Y ), and the left hand term in this identity is\nHomA/(x) (C/xC, Y /xY ).\n\n6\n\nMain result\n\nTheorem 6.1 Let C be a semidualizing module over the local noetherian\nring A, and let Y be a module of finite C-dimension s. Then C-dim Y =\ndepth C \u2212 depth Y .\nProof Let C be a C-resolution of Y of length s. We have seen in Theorem\n4.3 that hC (Y ) has a minimal free resolution of the same length s, say F.\nNow let x be a nonzerodivisor on Y , by section 3 it is also one on hC (Y ).\nAccording to [16, section 13.1.9] and [4, Th. 9.4.7, Rem. 9.4.8] it is even\none in A, because the module hC (Y ) has finite projective dimension. Thus\nx is a nonzerodivisor on C. The previous section tells us that over the local\nring A/(x), we are in the same position. Namely, C/xC is semidualizing\nover this ring, and hC (Y )/xhC (Y ) = HomA/(x) (C/xC, Y /xY ). By now it is\nstandard that C/xC is a C/xC-resolution of Y /xY and there is no shorter\none.\nIf we take the minimal resolution F for K at the end of section 4, the\nfree A/(x)-resolution F/xF of HomA/(x) (C/xC, Y /xY ) is also minimal, so\nwe recover the well-known fact that pdA/(x) hC (Y )/xhC (Y ) = pdA hC (Y )\n[12, Ch. 4-1, Th. E]. The left hand term is equal to the C/xC-dimension of\nthe A/(x)-module Y /xY says Theorem 4.3.\nWe continue dividing out by a regular sequence x1 , ..., xt on Y where t =\ndepth Y , x1 = x, and write a for the ideal it generates. Over the factor ring\nA/a we have depth Y /aY = depth hC (Y )/ahC (Y ) = 0, the latter module still\nhaving projective dimension pd hC (Y ). By the Auslander-Buchsbaum formula this integer is depth A/a = depth A \u2212 t, so that pd hC (Y ) = depth A \u2212\ndepth hC (Y ). Carrying this over to the other side, we find C-dim Y =\ndepth C \u2212 depth Y .\n\n\fIn semidualizing theory, Auslander-Buchsbaum identities have been stated\nbefore. For instance, working with total reflexivity, as basic fact 8 in [9],\nand for semidualizing complexes in [5, Th. 3.14]. From Diana White I\nunderstand that she obtained a result which implies the above version, to\nappear in the joint paper with Takahashi.\nWe summarize a number of identities which stem from the affinity between our ring A and its semidualizing module C, and the close fit between\nC-resolutions of a module Y and the free resolutions of hC (Y ) into which\nhC takes them, in\nCorollary 6.2 Let C be a semidualizing module over the noetherian local\nring A. Then Ass C = Ass A, Supp C = Spec A, dim C = dim A, and both\nmodules have the same nonzerodivisors and the same depth. For any module\nY , one has Ass Y = Ass hC (Y ), Supp Y = Supp hC (Y ), dim Y = dim hC (Y ),\nand both modules have the same nonzerodivisors. If C-dim Y is finite, it is\nequal to pd hC (Y ) and depth Y = depth hC (Y ).\nRemark 6.3 As the reader will have noticed, the arguments have all been\nimmediate and standard from the definition of semidualizing onward. Until\nthe proof of the last theorem. Here we used the fact that a nonzerodivisor\non a module of finite projective dimension is a nonzerodivisor in the ring.\nOr even that a regular sequence on such a module is a regular sequence in\nthe ring. This was conjectured by M. Auslander [13, Ch. 2-3] and essentially\nproven there in the equal characteristic case, and then in [14] for all rings.\nIt belongs to the so-called \"Homological Conjectures\" which apparently operate at a deeper level. This one generalizes slightly to the final result.\nAnother generalization was obtained by my then-time student J. Bartijn for\nequicharacteristic rings [16, Th. 13.1.9].\nCorollary 6.4 A regular sequence on a module of finite C-dimension extends to a maximal regular sequence on C which is also regular in the ring.\n\nReferences\n[1] T.
