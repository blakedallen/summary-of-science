A semiconductor-based twodimensional electron gas (2DEG) lacking inversion symmetry is known to electrically generate nonequilibrium\nspin density through the spin-orbit interaction [2, 3]. The\nsame type of spin-orbit interaction, named after Rashba\n[4], is the driving force behind numerous recent interesting discoveries, e.g., the well-known spin-Hall effect [5, 6].\nBesides its dominating role in semiconductor structures, Rashba spin-orbit interaction is expected to\nemerge in a thin ferromagnetic layer, such as cobalt (Co),\nsandwiched asymmetrically between a heavy metal thin\nfilm (Pt) and a layer of metal oxides (AlOx ) [7\u201310]. In\nsuch a quasi-two-dimensional metal layer (see Fig.1), the\neffective field BR generated by the spin-orbit interaction\nis predicted to excite the ferromagnetic order parameter\nby a charge current [11\u201313], which has been confirmed\nby several experiments [7\u201310]. This spin torque, coined\nRashba torque, falls into to a broader family where the\nspin-orbit interaction enables a transfer of angular momentum between the spin and orbital degrees of freedom,\nand has been observed in diluted magnetic semiconductors [14\u201316]. The same type of spin-orbit-induced torque\nis predicted to improve current-driven domain wall motion [12, 13] as it has been shown experimentally [10].\nRecently, Miron et al., [9] has demonstrated the currentinduced magnetization switching in a single ferromagnet,\nwhich represents an outstanding alternative to the celebrated Slonczewski-Berger spin-transfer torque [17, 18]\nthat requires noncollinear magnetic textures such as spin\nvalves or domain walls [19].\nIn a nonmagnetic 2DEG, the diffusive spin dynamics in the presence of Rashba spin-orbit interaction and\nD'yakonov-Perel spin relaxation [20] has attracted significant attention [21\u201323], resulting in further intrigue\nsuch as spin-Hall edges [24]. We foresee that in a metallic ferromagnetic layer accommodating both a Rashba\nspin-orbit interaction and an exchange splitting, the com-\n\nBR\nz\n\nm\n\nje\n\ny\n\nx\n\nFIG. 1: A schematic view of a Co film sandwiched by a metaloxide layer (AlOx ) and a heavy metal (Pt). The magnetization direction m\u0302 is arbitrary, the in-plane charge current is\nje , and BR is the Rashba effective field perpendicular to je .\n\npetition between spin relaxation (induced by random\nmagnetic impurities and D'yakonov-Perel) and the spin\nprecession enforced by both exchange and Rashba field\ngives rise to complex spin dynamics that is important to\ncurrent-driven magnetization manipulation and anomalous Hall effect. Meanwhile, theoretical accounts on\nRashba torque are, so far, limited to an infinite medium\n[11, 12], where diffusive motion is absent. In this Letter, we employ the Keldysh technique [25] to derive a\ndiffusion equation describing the coupled dynamics of\ncharge and spin in a quasi-two-dimensional ferromagnetic layer submitted to a Rashba spin-orbit interaction. We show that the coupling between the magnetism\nand the spin-orbit interaction, as mediated by the electrons through s \u2212 d exchange, leads to a Rashba torque\n(T ) that has both out-of-plane and in-plane components,\ni.e., T = T\u22a5 \u0177 \u00d7 m\u0302 + Tk m\u0302 \u00d7 (\u0177 \u00d7 m\u0302). In the case of a\nnarrow magnetic wire, we show that the in-plane torque\nTk can be enhanced significantly.\nThe total Hamiltonian for conducting electrons (with\neffective mass m) in a quasi-two-dimensional ferromagnetic layer in x\u2212y plane is (~ = 1 is assumed throughout)\nHT =\n\n1\nk\u03022\n+ \u03b1\u03c3\u0302 * (k\u0302 \u00d7 \u1e91) + \u2206xc \u03c3\u0302 * m\u0302 + H i\n2m\n2\n\n(1)\n\n\f2\nwhere k is the momentum, \u03b1 is the Rashba constant,\n\u03c3\u0302 the Pauli matrices, \u2206xc the ferromagnetic exchange\nsplitting,\nm\u0302 the magnetization direction, and H i =\nPN\nj=1 V (r \u2212 Rj ) the spin-independent impurity potential with centers located at Rj . An electric field is applied and to be included in the following discourse. Using\nDyson equation [25], the advanced and retarded Green's\nfunctions \u011cA and \u011cR , Keldysh function \u011cK , and the\nself-energy \u03a3\u0302A,R,K are related by the quantum kinetic\nequation [23, 25]\n[\u011cR ]\u22121 \u011cK \u2212 \u011cK [\u011cA ]\u22121 = \u03a3\u0302K \u011cA \u2212 \u011cR \u03a3\u0302K ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere all Green's functions are the full functions.\nTo obtain a diffusion equation from Eq.(2), we assume short-range \u03b4-function type impurity scatterers at\nlow concentration with a weak coupling to electrons\n[23], then a second-order Born approximation is justified,\ni.e., \u03a3\u0302A,R,K (r, r \u2032 ) = \u03b4(r, r \u2032 )\u011cA,R,K (r, r)/(m\u03c4 ). The\nmomentum relaxation rate 1/\u03c4 due to spin-independent\nimpurities is evaluated at the Fermi energy. The quasiclassical distribution function \u011d \u2261 \u011dk,\u01eb (T, R), as the\nWigner transform of the Keldysh function \u011cK (r, t; r \u2032 , t\u2032 ),\nis obtained by integrating out the relative spatialtemporal coordinates while retaining the center-of-mass\nones R = (r + r \u2032 )/2 and T = (t + t\u2032 )/2.

Spin transport in ferromagnetic\nlayers in a real experimental setup [7, 9, 10] is exposed to\nrandom magnetic scatterers, for which an isotropic spinflip relaxation S/\u03c4sf is introduced phenomenologically.\nIn total, we have\n\u2202n\n=D\u22072 n + B\u2207z * S\n\u2202t\n+ \u0393\u2207z * m\u0302n + R\u2207z * m\u0302(S * m\u0302),\n(7)\n\u2202S\n1\n1\nS\u22a5\n=D\u22072 S \u2212 Sk \u2212\n\u2202t\n\u03c4k\n\u03c4\u22a5\n1\nm\u0302 \u00d7 (S \u00d7 m\u0302)\n\u2212 \u2206xc S \u00d7 m\u0302 \u2212\nTxc\n+ B\u2207z n + 2C\u2207z \u00d7 S + 2R(m\u0302 * \u2207z n)m\u0302\n+ \u0393 [m\u0302 \u00d7 (\u2207z \u00d7 S) + \u2207z \u00d7 (m\u0302 \u00d7 S)] ,\n(8)\nwhere \u2207z \u2261 \u1e91 \u00d7 \u2207. Accounting for both D'yakonovPerel and random magnetic impurities, rate 1/\u03c4k \u2261\n1/\u03c4xc + 1/\u03c4sf measures the relaxation of the spin density Sk \u2261 Sx x\u0302 + Sy \u0177, as 1/\u03c4\u22a5 \u2261 2/\u03c4xc + 1/\u03c4sf does to\nS\u22a5 \u2261 Sz \u1e91. Parameter Txc sets a time scale for the decay\nof the transverse (to m\u0302) component of the spin density,\nthus contributing directly to the spin torque [26].\nFor a broad range of the ratio \u03b1kF /\u2206xc , Eqs.(7) and\n(8) govern the full spin dynamics in a ferromagnetic\nlayer and constitute the main result of this Letter. We\ncan readily show [27] that the absence of magnetism\n(\u2206xc = 0) leaves the B term a source generating spin\n\n\f3\ndensity electrically [3, 23]. When spin-orbit coupling vanishes (\u03b1 = 0), the first two lines in Eq.(8) survive to\ndescribe a diffusive motion of spin density in a ferromagnetic metal, which agrees excellently with early results in\nthe corresponding limit [27, 28]. The C term represents\na coherent precession of the spin density around the effective Rashba field. The precession of the spin density\n(induced by the Rashba field) around the exchange field is\ndescribed by the \u0393 term, is thus at a higher order (compared to C) in the dirty limit for \u0393 = \u2206xc \u03c4 C/2. The\nR-term contributes to a magnetization renormalization.\nTo illustrate the spin dynamics and the Rashba spin\ntorque embedded in Eq.(8), we restore the electric field\nof strength E applied along the x\u0302 direction by a shift\n\u2207 \u2192 \u2207 + eE x\u0302\u2202\u01eb [23]. This Letter is focusing on a\nweak spin-orbit coupling \u03b1kF < \u2206xc [11, 12]; i.e., the\nspin density is aligned dominantly along the local magnetization. Thus, the deviation due to effective Rashba\nfield BR \u221d je \u00d7 \u1e91 (along the \u0177 direction in the present\nsetup) is considered as a perturbation. We may approximate the energy derivative \u2202\u01eb S \u2248 PF NF m\u0302 and\n\u2202\u01eb n \u2248 nF /\u01ebF = NF , given NF the density of states and\nPF the polarization; both quantities are at Fermi energy\n\u01ebF .\nConsider an infinite homogeneous ferromagnetic layer\n[11], we replace \u2207 by eE x\u0302\u2202\u01eb and Eq. (8) is\n1\n1\n1\n\u2202S\nS\u2212\nS \u00d7 m\u0302\nm\u0302 \u00d7 (S \u00d7 m\u0302) \u2212\n=\u2212\n\u2202t\n\u03c4sf\nTxc\n\u03c4\u2206\n+ eE NF [2PF C \u0177 \u00d7 m\u0302 + PF \u0393m\u0302 \u00d7 (\u0177 \u00d7 m\u0302)] . (9)\nwhere the higher-order contribution proportional to R is\ndiscarded and \u03c4\u2206 \u2261 1/\u2206xc characterizes the time scale of\nthe precession of the spin density around the magnetization. The spin torque exerted on the local magnetization\nby the nonequilibrium spin density is given by\nT =\n\n1\n1\nS \u00d7 m\u0302 +\nm\u0302 \u00d7 (S \u00d7 m\u0302),\n\u03c4\u2206\nTxc\n\n(10)\n\ntaking into account a fieldlike spin precession and dephasing of the transverse component that is essentially\nthe Slonczewski-Berger type spin-transfer torque. At a\nstationary state \u2202S/\u2202t = 0, Eq.(9) leads to a general\nform T = T\u22a5 \u0177 \u00d7 m\u0302 + Tk m\u0302 \u00d7 (\u0177 \u00d7 m\u0302) that is\nT =\n\nje PF\n[(2\u03b7C + \u03b2\u0393)\u0177 \u00d7 m\u0302\neD 1 + \u03b6 2\n+(\u03b7\u0393 \u2212 2\u03b2C)m\u0302 \u00d7 (\u0177 \u00d7 m\u0302)] ,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere je = e2 nF \u03c4 E /m is the current density, \u03b6 =\n\u03c4\u2206 (1/\u03c4sf + 1/Txc), \u03b7 = 1 + \u03b6\u03c4\u2206 /Txc , and \u03b2 = \u03c4\u2206 /\u03c4sf\n[28]. The first term in Eq.(11) is an out-of-plane torque\ndriven by the effective field BR and is perpendicular to\nthe (m\u0302, BR ) plane. Using the data from experiments\n[7], we take \u03b1 \u2248 10\u221210 eVm, polarization PF = 0.5, saturation magnetization Ms \u2248 1.09 \u00d7 106 A m\u22121 , and the\n\ncurrent density je = 108 A cm\u22122 , the effective field generating the out-of-plane torque is estimated to be of the\norder of 1 T.\nThe second in-plane torque arises from the change of\nthe spin density induced by its precession around the\nexchange field (\u221d \u0393) as well as to the presence of spin flip\nin the layer (\u221d \u03b2), inducing a spin density that is parallel\nto BR \u00d7 m\u0302 (or \u0177 \u00d7 m\u0302) [27], hence leading to a torque\nin the (m\u0302, \u0177) plane. In other words, the in-plane torque\nis driven by an effective field along the direction BR \u00d7\nm\u0302. In the limit \u03c4sf \u2192 \u221e, the ratio Tk /T\u22a5 \u2248 \u2206xc \u03c4 /4,\napproaches a constant. When considering Txc \u2192 \u221e and\n\u0393 \u226a C (dirty limit), the in-plane torque diminishes and\nEq.(11) is in a good agreement with Ref. [11].\nThe impact of diffusion on the Rashba spin torque is\nappreciated by numerically solving Eq. (8) in a semiinfinite ferromagnetic wire with a width L along the y\naxis. The wire is open on the transport direction x\u0302, along\nwhich an electric field is applied (thus \u2207x \u2192 eE x\u0302\u2202\u01eb ). To\ncompare with the recent experiment [9], the magnetization is aligned perpendicularly along \u1e91. Two boundary\nconditions are available in the transversal direction (y):\nvanishing spin density S(y = \u00b1L/2) = 0 or vanishing\nspin current Jy (y = \u00b1L/2) = 0 at the boundaries. The\nformer condition indicates an absorbent surface where\nspin-flip relaxation at the boundaries is fairly strong, thus\nsuppressing the spin density. A vanishing spin current\ndesignates a fully reflective boundary where the spin current is reflected. In the present simulation, we choose to\nadopt the boundary condition according to the work of\nKato et al., [29]: optical detection on the spatial profile\nof the spin density induced by the spin-Hall effect in a\nn-GaAs 2DEG reveals that the spin density vanishes at\nthe interfaces. We believe that the recent experiments\non Rashba spin torque in ferromagnetic layers [7, 9, 10]\nfall into this picture.\nFigure 2 shows the spatial profile of the three components of the spin density: Sx (panels a and d), Sy (panels\nb and e), and Sz (panels c and f), for various magnitudes\nof \u03b1. The spin-orbit interaction drives the spin dynamics\nin two prominent ways: the first is explained by Edelstein\n[3]; i.e., a nonequilibrium spin density at \u0177 direction is\ngenerated electrically, becoming a source to a nonvanishing Sy in the center of the wire. Second, the spin density\nprecesses around the total field combining the exchange\n(\u2206xc m\u0302 \u00d7 S) and the effective fields (2C\u2207z \u00d7 S). In the\ncase of a wide magnetic wire, this precession is localized near the edges of the wire and vanishes towards the\ncenter where the nonequilibrium spin density generated\nby spin-orbit coupling gets robust along the Rashba field\n(\u0177 direction). Consequently, the Sx component, though\nmuch smaller in magnitude than Sy , is peaked at the\nboundaries; see Figs.2 (b) and 2(c). The profile of the Sz\ncomponent has an opposite sign at two edges, which is\ndriven by the rotation of the spin accumulation around\nthe effective Rashba fields (pointing oppositely to each\n\n\f4\n(d)\n\n-2\n\nSpin Torque\n\n-2\n\n0.6x10\n\n-2\n\n0.01\n\n0.3x10\n\n-2\n\n0.2x10\n\n-2\n\n0.1x10\n\n0.00\n\n(e)\n\n(b)\n\n0.050\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n1.0\n0.5\n\n40 nm\n30 nm\n\n0.0\n\n20 nm\n10 nm\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n0.0\n\n-1.0\n8.0x10\n\n-4\n\n1.6x10\n\n-3\n\n-3\n\n2.4x10\n\n0.0\n\n(eV.nm)\n\n0.1\n\n0.025\n\nL= 1000 nm\n50 nm\n\n10\n\n8.0x10\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n1.6x10\n\n2.4x10\n\n-3\n\n(eV.nm)\n\n(c)\n\nl\n\nsf\n\n=100 nm\n\n0.0\nl\n\nsf\n\n=5 nm\n\n-0.1\n\nl\n\nsf\n\n=10 nm\n\n|\n\n0.000\n0.002\n\nT /T\n\n(f)\n\n(c)\n\nl\n\n-0.2\n\nsf\n\n=2 nm\n\n||\n\nNon-equilibrium Spin Density /(P\n\n20\n\nx10-3/(PFje/eD) (nm.s-1)\n\n(a)\n=1x10 eV.nm\n\nF e\n\nj /eD)(nm)\n\n0.02\n\n0.001\n\n-0.3\n-0.4\n\n0.000\n\n-0.5\n\n-0.001\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\nL (nm)\n\n-0.002\n-20\n\n-10\n\n0\ny (nm)\n\n10\n\n20\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n5\n\ny (nm)\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) Spatial profile of nonequilibrium spin\ndensity Sx (a),(d), Sy (b),(e), and Sz (c),(f) for a width L =\n50nm (a),(b),(c) and L = 10nm (d),(e),(f) for \u03b1 = 0.1 \u2212\n1 \u00d7 10\u22122 eV*nm. The parameters are \u03c4 = 10\u221215 s, exchange\nsplitting \u2206xc = 1014 s\u22121 , spin relaxation time \u03c4sf = 10\u221212 s,\ndiffusion constant D = 125 \u00d7 10\u22126 m2 s\u22121 .\n\nother) generated while diffusing transversally along opposite directions (i.e., negative y and positive y axes).\nIn the case of a weak spin-orbit coupling addressed in\nthis Letter, the spin density profile is mainly symmetric\nalong the (transverse) y direction. In the opposite limit of\na strong spin-orbit coupling, the spin-Hall effect induces\na large spin imbalance along the transverse direction of\nthe wire, which favors a deeper asymmetry in the spatial\nprofile (not shown here). The narrow width (shorter than\nthe spin-flip diffusion length defined by \u03c4sf ) of the wire\nprevents the relaxation of the spin density such that its\neffective magnitude in the middle of the wire may differ\nfrom its value in an infinite medium.\nTherefore, one expects a strong influence of the wire\nwidth on the magnitude and sign of the Rashba spin\ntorque. Figures 3(a) and 3(b) display the magnitude of\nR L/2\nthe average torque \u2212L/2 T dy/L at different wire widths\nas a function of \u03b1. For a fixed \u03b1, by decreasing the wire\nwidth the in-plane torque Tk changes its sign and the\nmagnitude can be enhanced dramatically, while the magnitude of the out-of-plane torque T\u22a5 is just moderately\nreduced. Figure 3(c) shows the ratio Tk /T\u22a5 as a function\nof the wire width for different spin diffusion lengths. Several features deserve attention. (i) For a given spin-flip\nrelaxation time (therefore the spin diffusion length), the\nratio approaches a constant when increasing the width of\nthe wire, while its absolute value increases exponentially\nwhen decreasing the width. (ii) For a wide wire with a\nlarge spin diffusion length, the ratio tends towards the\nbulk value Tk /T\u22a5 = \u2206xc \u03c4 /4. Using the present value\n\u2206xc = 1014 s\u22121 and \u03c4 = 10\u221215 s, the bulk value is about\n\nFIG. 3: (Color online) Out-of-plane (a) and in-plane (b)\ntorques as a function of \u03b1 for different wire widths.

The other parameters are the same as in Fig.\n2.\n\n0.03, which agrees well with the numeric value (black\nsolid line) in Fig.3 (c). (iii) The sign of the ratio can be\nswitched by the wire width or the spin relaxation rate,\nas is reflected in the second term in Eq. (11).\nIn a recent work, Miron et al., [9] has demonstrated a\ncurrent-induced magnetization reversal in a perpendicularly magnetized single ferromagnet. In Eq.(11) of this\nLetter, the effective field (producing the in-plane torque)\nparallel to BR \u00d7 m\u0302 explains the effective perpendicular\nmagnetic field BSz required to accomplish the magnetization switching [9]. In the Co layer as sandwiched\nby metal oxides and heavy metal with a large spin-orbit\ncoupling, the spin-flip relaxation length is believed to be\nmuch shorter than its value in the bulk Co, hence further\nenhancing the in-plane torque: see Fig.3 (c). If we take\n\u2206xc \u2248 5 \u00d7 1014 s\u22121 (or 0.3 eV) [30], \u03c4sf \u2248 10\u221212 s, and\n\u03c4 \u2248 10\u221215 s, then we have \u03b2 \u2248 0.002, \u03b6 \u2248 \u03c4\u2206 /Txc \u2248 0.5,\nand \u03b7 is of order 1. A quick estimate suggests that\nthe perpendicular switching field generating the in-plane\ntorque is about 100 mT, which agrees with the estimation in Ref.[9]. In the case of magnetic domain walls,\nthe present torque acts like a transverse field that can\nincrease the Walker breakdown limit and enhance the\nrange for the nonadiabatic current-driven domain wall\nmotion [31]. Miron et al., exploited this characteristic to\ninterpret large current-driven domain wall velocities in\nperpendicularly magnetized domain walls [10].\nMost of the previous works on transitions metals have\nbeen carried out in fairly complex structures where interfacial Rashba spin-orbit coupling has not been evaluated\nexperimentally or theoretically. Identifying the relevant\nmechanisms is an urgent need [32]. Among them, the\nmicroscopic description of interfacial Rashba spin-orbit\ncoupling in ultrathin layers as well as the spin dynamics\n\n\f5\nin the presence spin-orbit coupling will provide essential\ninformation to the electrical manipulation of spins in low\ndimensional systems.\nWe are grateful to G.
