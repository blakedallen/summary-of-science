In the literature, these two\nstrands are kept largely separate; both, however suffer from severe limitations. Laser\ncooling of atoms and molecules largely relies on the internal level structure of the species\nbeing cooled. As a result, only a small number of elements and a tiny number of\nmolecules can be cooled this way. In the case of micromirrors, the problem lies in the\nengineering of micromirrors that need to satisfy a large number of constraints-these\ninclude a high mechanical Q-factor, high reflectivity and very good optical quality, weak\ncoupling to the substrate, etc.-in order to enable efficient cooling.\nDuring the course of this thesis, I will draw these two sides of laser cooling closer\ntogether by means of a single, generically applicable scattering theory that can be used\nto explain the interaction between light and matter at a very general level. I use this\n'transfer matrix' formalism to explore the use of the retarded dipole\u2013dipole interaction\nas a means of both enhancing the efficiency of micromirror cooling systems and rendering\nthe laser cooling of atoms and molecules less species selective. In particular, I identify the\n'external cavity cooling' mechanism, whereby the use of an optical memory in the form\nof a resonant element (such as a cavity), outside which the object to be cooled sits, can\npotentially lead to the construction of fully integrated optomechanical systems and even\ntwo-dimensional arrays of translationally cold atoms, molecules or even micromirrors.\nThe concept of an optical memory is a very general one, and I use it to link together\nmechanisms that would otherwise appear disparate, including the cavity cooling of atoms\nand cooling mechanisms based on the non-adiabatic following of atomic populations. A\nfully vectorial three-dimensional scattering theory including the effects of such a memory\nis also presented and used to explore several different experimentally-realisable cooling\nconfigurations.\n\n\fContents\nAbstract\n\ni\n\nList of Figures\n\nvi\n\nDeclaration of Authorship\n\nviii\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nix\n\nIntroduction\n\n1\n\nI\n\n5\n\nAtomic Physics Theory &

I will forever be indebted to all\nthose who were there to patiently guide me along the way and, perhaps just as patiently,\npoint me in the right direction in the 1,001 occasions where I interrupted their thoughts\nto ask some basic question.\nThe Quantum Control group at the University of Southampton has always been a bit of\na mystery to me: moments of tremendous insight are generally punctuated by periods\nwhere we all seem to be eight years old. I appreciate being thrown into the deep, dark end\nof experimental atomic physics during the first few weeks of my stay at Southampton\nwhen James Bateman and Matthew Himsworth asked me to do some work in their\nlaboratory. My subsequent prediliction for theoretical work should not be interpreted as\nbeing due to that experience! James also provided some much needed physical insight\nat times. Richard Murray, who I am fond of disagreeing with, often provided an extra\npoint of view on whatever it was that we would be discussing at the time. Being an\nopinionated Mediterranean, I found this rather useful (in retrospect, of course). Hamid\nOhadi, the experimentalist par excellence and former ion trapper, and his laboratory\nprovided a well-needed distraction whenever I got bored with my sums. I'd also like to\nthank Nathan Cooper, who is working with Hamid to explore experimentally some of\nour less crazy ideas and who took over my duty as official tea-maker on Fridays.\nI must also mention Peter Domokos, whose insight triggered off a sequence of events\nthat led to the results in this thesis that I am perhaps most proud of. Sandro Grech\nand the various advisers and tutors I had at the University of Malta, especially David\nBuhagiar and Charles Sammut, always encouraged me to pursue my fascination with\nmathematics and physics.\nFinally, I must thank my family for their support; every one of them\u2020 was an inspiration,\nand I would have been a very different person were it not for them. Sharon, who always\nstuck by my side, listening to my grumbling, pushing me along, and generally being\nthere for me, I cannot help but thank from the bottom of my heart.\n\"Oh, and just one more thing...\"-words probably cannot express how exasperated my\nsupervisors, Tim Freegarde and Peter Horak, must have felt at times because of my\nhard-headedness. Without their help this work would have never gotten to the starting\nblocks and, at the risk of repeating myself, I feel I have to tell them a deeply heartfelt\n\"thanks!\" Working with both of them proved to be a tremendous learning experience\nand I have nothing but words of praise for them, both in their role as advisers and in\ntheir role as scientists.\n\u2020\n\nAnd there are quite a few: Zak, Rebekah, Luke, Konrad, Charmaine, Maria, and of course my parents.\n\nix\n\n\f\fis an important and popular fact that things are not always what they seem.

Amidst all of this, cold atoms can be seen as the ideal\nprototypical system with which to explore nature. In contrast to the sledgehammer approach so typical of high-energy physics experiments, clouds of ultracold matter provide\nan almost blank canvas that one can use as a microscope to probe the behaviour of\nmatter at the atomic, and even subatomic [2], scale. Optical cooling is perhaps the only\ndirect way of producing these ultracold clouds.\nTherein lies the catch, however. Whereas the most sensitive probes of various physical\nlaws are perhaps the more complicated molecules, most optical cooling methods in use\ntoday are applicable to only a small (albeit growing) fraction of the periodic table.\nExperiments are quickly advancing to the point where a select few \"normal\"2 molecules\nwill soon be optically cooled on demand [5, 6] and the race is now on to find methods\nof cooling any given molecule to ultracold temperatures.\nIn the related field of optomechanics, and I will in due course examine how the relation\nwith cold atoms runs deeper than the widespread use of the word \"cold\" in the literature,\nthe aim of cooling a macroscopic vibrating object to its ground state has been achieved\n1\n\nI am somewhat fond, however unfairly, of mentioning string theory in this context. See Ref. [1] for an\noverview into the birth of string theory that suggests otherwise.\n\n2\n\nUltracold di-alkali molecules are reasonably common (see Refs. [3] and [4] for reviews), but require\nultracold atoms as building blocks.\n\n1\n\n\fIntroduction\n\n2\n\nusing cryogenic methods [7], but several experimental groups [8\u201310] are tirelessly working\nto achieve the same using optical cooling methods.\nNew cooling paradigms thus have to be devised, perhaps borrowing a healthy dose of\ninspiration from those currently in use, to bridge the gaps between the cooling of simple\natoms, the cooling of arbitrary molecules, and even the cooling of micro- and mesoscopic\nstructures.\n\nBrief overview of past work\nOptical cooling of the motion of particles was originally observed in the regime of small\ndielectric particles, with Ashkin hypothesising [11] that similar ideas might be applicable to the control of atomic and molecular motion. Wonderful progress was made, both\nin experiment [12, 13] and in theory [14, 15] in extending these ideas to three dimensions and in exploiting the internal structure of simple atoms. Cloud temperatures of\ntens of \u03bcK have long been considered routine in magneto\u2013optical traps [16]. Cooling\nthe motion of dielectric particles proved to be more challenging, especially because the\ninitial explorations [11] were conducted with the particles in suspension whereas a more\ndesirable configuration [17] would be with the particle suspended in vacuum; cooling of a\nmicroscopic particle to millikelvin temperatures was indeed reported very recently [18].\nSub-Doppler cooling mechanisms, of the type reported in Ref. [14], shift the energy loss\nprocess from the decay of the excited state population to the non-adiabatic decay of\nthe population of different hyperfine levels. In the search for more generally-applicable\ncooling methods, it was realised that one can similarly shift the energy loss process to the\ndecay of a degree of freedom external to the atom. This led to the proposal for the cooling\nof atomic motion inside a driven cavity [19]-demonstrated recently in experiments by\nthe Vuleti\u0107 [20] and Rempe [21] groups-by extension of similar mechanisms for cooling\natomic motion using the modified vacuum field present in a cavity [22]. Following a\nseparate line of research, Braginsky and co-workers [23] suggested using cavity fields to\ncool the motion of micro- or mesoscopic mirrors, initially in the context of gravitational\nwave detectors. Experimentally, this idea lay dormant until technology improved to the\npoint where such effects could be unambiguously demonstrated [24, 25], for example\n\n\fIntroduction\n\n3\n\nby cooling the vibrational motion of a micromechanical oscillator from an occupation\nnumber of around 53 000 quanta (2.25 K) to ca. 32 quanta (1.3 mK) [26].\nThese two streams can be seen as two limiting cases of a general 'matter interacting\nwith a cavity field' configuration, with the matter interacting weakly (atom) or strongly\n(microscopic mirror) with the cavity field. One of my aims in this thesis will be to\ncombine these two fields through the use of a generic matrix-based theoretical approach.\nThe virtues of this approach are that such models are solvable in the fully general case,\nand that no restriction is placed on the strength of the light\u2013matter interaction.\nOn a more general level, these ideas can be united with Sisyphus\u2013type cooling mechanisms that make use of internal atomic variables following external ones non-adiabatically.\nThis link comes about because a cavity field also introduces a non-adiabatic 'delay' element into the dynamics of the situation. This idea of a system with a delay, or memory,\nas a means to a generic optical cooling mechanism will also be one of the recurring\nthemes throughout this thesis.\n\nOutline of thesis\nThis thesis will begin with a general, if somewhat brief, overview of atomic physics,\nwhich will allow me to discuss several of the \"standard\" cooling or trapping methods in\ncurrent use. In Chapter 2 I will look at what can be viewed as a prototypical system for\ncavity cooling of atoms, which I call 'mirror-mediated cooling', and explore it from the\nsemiclassical perspective.\nThe discussion in Part II will see me exploring two classical theories of light\u2013matter\ninteractions: one based on the transfer matrix method, in Chapter 3, and one based on\na delayed fully vectorial three-dimensional scattering theory, in Chapter 5. The transfer\nmatrix theory is developed in Section 3.1, solved in the general case in Section 3.2,\nand extended in Section 3.4 to describe multi-level atoms. It is then applied to the\nmirror-mediated cooling paradigm and, in Chapter 4, to another system, 'external cavity\ncooling', which promises to be very important in optomechanical experiments. As a\nfinal application of the matrix formalism, I will explore another configuration, in a\nunidirectional ring cavity with a gain medium, which allows one to dispense with certain\n(somewhat stringent) requirements in mirror-mediated cooling. The scattering theory\ndeveloped in Chapter 5 is also initially applied to the one-dimensional mirror-mediated\n\n\fIntroduction\n\n4\n\ncooling geometry, in order to verify the method, and is then used to describe mirrormediated cooling in three dimensions and also the \"optical binding\" of a refractive\nparticle to its own reflection.\nIn the final part, I will first discuss the experimental work that is currently underway\nin the laboratories at the University of Southampton to explore both the consequences\nof the above, and atom\u2013surface interactions in a more general context. Finally, I will\nanalyse several of the cooling configurations discussed throughout this thesis from an\nexperimental point of view and give an estimate for the performance that can be expected\nfrom each configuration under realistic experimental conditions.\n\nLogical connections between chapters\n\n\fPart I\n\nAtomic Physics Theory\n&\nCooling Methods\n\n5\n\n\fChapter 1\n\nAtom\u2013field interactions\n[...] [T]he semiclassical theory, when extended to take into account both the effect\nof the field on the molecules and the effect of the molecules on the field, reproduces\nalmost quantitatively the same laws of energy exchange and coherence properties\nas the quantised field theory, even in the limit of one or a few quanta in the field\nmode.\nE. T. Jaynes and F. W. Cummings, Proceedings of the IEEE 51, 89 (1963)\n\nI begin this chapter with a very brief review of atomic structure, covering the fine and\nhyperfine structures as well as the magnetic sublevels within the hyperfine manifold;\nthese ideas will be used later to discuss trapping and cooling of atoms. The following\nsections describe the density matrix approach and build up to a derivation of the Optical\nBloch Equations. These equations are the tools necessary to examine the interaction\nbetween an atom and the electromagnetic field and, ultimately, to derive an expression\nfor the forces acting on an atom, as parametrised by the polarisability of that atom.\nThe chapter continues with a note on the fluctuation\u2013dissipation theorem and shows\nhow the calculation of the full force acting on the atom allows the prediction of the\nequilibrium temperature a population of such atoms will tend to, and concludes with\na short discussion on multi-level atoms. The reader is referred to Refs. [27\u201333], and\nreferences therein, for a more in-depth and complete treatment of certain parts of this\nchapter.\n\n6\n\n\f7\n\nAtom\u2013field interactions\n\n1.1\n\nAtomic structure\n\nIt has been known for centuries that the spectrum of the light emitted by excited atomic\ngases is made up of a finite, and usually large, number of distinct spectral lines. These\nlines are not randomly distributed but can be divided into various closely-spaced groups.\nEach of these groups can be thought of as being due to the coarse structure of the\nenergy levels of the atom; i.e., each group of lines in the coarse structure originates from\na particular transition between two (electron) energy levels. Each energy level has an\nassociated orbital angular momentum, L. The total angular momentum J of an electron\nincludes a contribution from both L and the electron's intrinsic spin angular momentum\nS:\nJ =L+S,\n\n(1.1)\n\nwhereby the corresponding quantum number J is an integer or half-integer in the range\n|L\u2212S| \u2264 J \u2264 L+S. This is called the LS coupling scheme [31]. We adopt the convention\np\nthat a quantised momentum vector v has magnitude v(v + 1)~. The different possible\nvalues of J give rise to the fine structure in the spectrum.\n\nDrilling down further, each line in the fine structure spectrum can be subdivided. This\narises from the coupling, or interaction, between the total angular momentum of the\nelectron and the angular momentum I of the nucleus. We can then define an atomic\nangular momentum F as [31]\nF =J +I,\n\n(1.2)\n\nwhere F again takes any integer or half-integer value in the range |J \u2212 I| \u2264 F \u2264 J + I.\nFinally, we denote the quantisation axis of our system as z, whereby the projection of\nF along z is denoted Fz \u2261 mF ~, with \u2212F \u2264 mF \u2264 F , mF again being an integer or\nhalf-integer. In general, F can take several values for each of the fine structure levels;\nthis gives rise to the hyperfine structure in the observed spectrum.\nWe will temporarily constrain ourselves to the transition of perhaps largest experimental\ninterest in cold atoms, the L = 0 \u2192 L = 1 transition in alkali atoms (the so-called D\nline), where S = 1/2. First of all, we note that the ground state (L = 0) has only one\nfine structure level (J = 1/2) whereas the excited state (L = 1) has two: J = 1/2 and\nJ = 3/2. The D line is therefore composed of two separate lines: the D1 line (2 S1/2 \u2192\n\n2P\n\n1/2 )\n\nand the D2 line (2 S1/2 \u2192 2 P3/2 ). In the preceding sentence we used spectroscopic\n\n\f8\n\nAtom\u2013field interactions\n\nnotation, whereby the levels with L = 0, 1, . . . are denoted by S, P, . . . , and where the\nsuperscript is equal to 2S + 1. The Hamiltonian that describes the hyperfine structure\nfor the D line transitions is, to lowest order [34],\n\u0124hfs = Ahfs I * J + Bhfs\n\n3(I * J )2 + 23 (I * J ) \u2212 I(I + 1)J(J + 1)\n,\n2I(2I \u2212 1)J(2J \u2212 1)\n\n(1.3)\n\nwith Ahfs being the magnetic dipole constant and Bhfs the electric quadrupole constant.\nThese are experimentally determined and can be found in standard references, such as\nRef. [35] for\n\n85 Rb.\n\nThe two terms in the preceding equation are due to the magnetic\n\ndipole and electric quadrupole interaction between I and J , respectively. Higher-order\nmultipole components were ignored in the above expression. The hyperfine levels subsequently incur an energy shift\n3\n\n\u2206Ehfs = 12 Ahfs K + Bhfs 2\n\nK(K + 1) \u2212 2I(I + 1)J(J + 1)\n,\n4I(2I \u2212 1)J(2J \u2212 1)\n\n(1.4)\n\nwhere we have defined K = F (F + 1) \u2212 I(I + 1) \u2212 J(J + 1) for convenience.\nIn the presence of a static external magnetic field B, it is convenient to define the\nquantisation axis z as being aligned with the applied field. The different mF levels\n(magnetic sublevels) undergo a shift depending on B = |B|. The effect on the atom of\nits interaction with B is qualitatively different for various regimes, depending on the\nsize of the energy shifts compared to the splitting between the levels. We will only be\nconcerned with the simplest of these cases, where the energy shift is small compared\nto the splitting between the hyperfine levels. In such cases, F is a good quantum\nnumber (i.e., its value is well-defined as the system evolves in time) and the interaction\nHamiltonian can be written\n\u0124B = \u03bcB gF F * B ,\n\n(1.5)\n\nwhere \u03bcB is the Bohr magneton and gF the Land\u00e9 g-factor given approximately by1\n\u0014\n\n\u0015 \u0014\n\u0015\n3J(J + 1) + S(S + 1) \u2212 L(L + 1)\nF (F + 1) \u2212 I(I + 1) + J(J + 1)\ngF \u2248\n\u00d7\n. (1.6)\n2J(J + 1)\n2F (F + 1)\nThe associated energy shift for each magnetic sublevel is then\n\u2206EB = \u03bcB gF mF B ,\n1\n\nSee Ref. [31, 35]; we approximate gS \u2248 2 in their notation.\n\n(1.7)\n\n\f9\n\nAtom\u2013field interactions\n\nwhich is therefore different for each value of mF , giving rise to the splitting between the\nmagnetic sublevels known as the Zeeman effect.\nA similar effect, called the DC Stark effect, occurs in the presence of DC electric fields.\nThe DC Stark effect is generally less pronounced than the Zeeman effect. To lowest\norder, the energy shift for each level is [31]\n\u2206EE \u221d Ez2 ,\n\n(1.8)\n\nwhere Ez is the electric field along the quantisation axis. It is only the higher order\nterms, omitted in the above expression, that lift the degeneracy for the different levels.\n\n1.2\n\nThe density matrix\n\nAny physical Hamiltonian that acts on a system is Hermitian; i.e., \u0124 \u2020 = \u0124. As such,\nit is diagonalisable and therefore affords a basis of eigenstates. The system acted on by\nthe Hamiltonian is said to be in a pure state if it can be represented as a weighted sum\nof the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian; in other words, if the Hamiltonian has eigenstates\n|\u03c80 i, |\u03c81 i, . . . , |\u03c8n i (n = 0, 1, . . . ), a pure state can be described by\n|\u03a8i =\n\nX\ni\n\nci |\u03c8i i ,\n\nwith the ci being complex numbers normalised according to the condition\nOften, the above eigenstates are represented as the basis vectors, with\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\u03c8i = \uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n\uf8fc\n0\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fd\n..\n.\uf8f4 i \u2212 1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n0\uf8fe\n\n(1.9)\nP\n\n2\ni |ci |\n\n= 1.\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n1\n\uf8f7\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n0\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fd\n\uf8f7\n..\n\uf8f7\n.\uf8f4 n \u2212 i \uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n0\uf8fe\n\n(1.10)\n\nbeing the ith basis vector in an n-dimensional complex Hilbert space. In general this\ndescription does not suffice since the state of the system may be a statistical mixture of\n\n\f10\n\nAtom\u2013field interactions\n\nthe different states |\u03a8i i, each of which is itself a weighted sum of the eigenstates of the\nHamiltonian, as in Eq. (1.9):\n|\u03a8i i =\n\nX\nj\n\n(i)\n\ncj |\u03c8j i .\n\n(1.11)\n\nWe can conveniently express the state of such a system using the density matrix formalism [27], in which we define the density matrix\n\u03c1=\n\nX\ni\n\npi |\u03a8i ih\u03a8i | ,\n\n(1.12)\n\nwhere each pi is interpreted as the probability of the system being in state |\u03a8i i; i.e.,\nP\ni pi = 1 and 0 \u2264 pi \u2264 1. We note that the diagonal elements of \u03c1 are of the form\nP\n(i) 2\n\u03c1ii = j pj cj , where i runs from 1 to n. \u03c1ii can be interpreted as the probability of\nfinding the system in the eigenstate \u03c8i . It is therefore called the population of this state.\nThe off-diagonal elements of this matrix are related to interference effects between pairs\nof different eigenstates, and are called coherences.\nThe usefulness of the density matrix formalism is readily apparent when calculating\nexpectation values of quantum mechanical operators, for let \u00c2 be such an operator with\nexpectation value h\u00c2i. Then,\n\n\u0001\nh\u00c2i = Tr \u03c1A ,\n\n(1.13)\n\nwith A being the matrix representation of \u00c2:\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\nA \u2261 h\u03c8i |\u00c2|\u03c8j i i,j .\n\n(1.14)\n\nWe will adopt this notation throughout: an operator \u00c2 and a matrix A correspond to\nthe same operation in different representations; the (i, j)th matrix element of A will\nbe denoted Aij . Let us see how Eq. (1.13) arises. For a system in pure state |\u03a8i, the\nP\nP\nexpectation value of \u00c2 is given by h\u00c2i = h\u03a8|\u00c2|\u03a8i = i,j c\u2217i cj h\u03c8i |\u00c2|\u03c8j i = i,j \u03c1ji Aij =\n\u0001\nP\nTr \u03c1A , where \u03c1 = |\u03a8ih\u03a8| = i,j ci c\u2217j |\u03c8i ih\u03c8j |. This relation similarly holds in the case\nof a statistical mixture of states.\n\nThe time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation [36] for a Hamiltonian \u0124 acting on a state\n\u2202\n|\u03c8i, \u0124|\u03c8i = i~ \u2202t\n|\u03c8i, can be used to show that\n\ni~\u03c1\u0307 = [H, \u03c1] \u2261 H\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1H ,\n\n(1.15)\n\n\f11\n\nAtom\u2013field interactions\n\nwhere we use the notation that a dot above a symbol represents its derivative with\nrespect to time:\n\u03c1\u0307 =\n\nX\ni\n\n=\n\nX\ni\n\npi\n\n\u0001\n\n\u2202\n\u2202t |\u03a8i i\n\nh\u03a8i | +\n\nX\ni\n\n\u0001\n\n\u2202\n\u2202t h\u03a8i |\n\nX\n\u0001\n\u0001\npi |\u03a8i i \u2212 i~1 h\u03a8i |\u0124 \u2020\npi i~1 \u0124|\u03a8i i h\u03a8i | +\n\n\"\n\n!\n\nX\n1\n\u0124\n=\npi |\u03a8i ih\u03a8i |\ni~\n=\n\npi |\u03a8i i\n\ni\n\ni\n\n\u2212\n\nX\ni\n\n! #\n\npi |\u03a8i ih\u03a8i | \u0124\n\n1\ni~ [H, \u03c1] ,\n\n(1.16)\n\nsince \u0124 is Hermitian.2 Eq. (1.15) is valid for systems that have no dissipation. Incoherent\nprocesses-such as the decay of the electromagnetic field inside a cavity, spontaneous\nemission, etc.-are a result of the system coupling to an infinity of modes, for example\nthe vacuum electromagnetic field. In most cases [37, \u00a75.1.1], such processes can be most\nconveniently described not by directly including them in the Hamiltonian but by adding\nso-called Lindblad terms to the preceding relation [38].3 These terms are represented by\na 'superoperator' L\u0302 acting on \u03c1, giving the full quantum master equation [37, \u00a75.4.2]:\n\u03c1\u0307 =\n\n1\ni~ [H, \u03c1]\n\n+ L\u0302\u03c1 .\n\n(1.17)\n\nIf the system described by \u03c1 is coupled to a zero-temperature environment with a decay\nconstant \u03ba, then the Lindblad terms take the generic form\n\u0001\nL\u0302\u03c1 = \u2212\u03ba \u0109\u2020 \u0109\u03c1 + \u03c1\u0109\u2020 \u0109 \u2212 2\u0109\u03c1\u0109\u2020 ,\n\n(1.18)\n\nwith \u0109 being an operator that describes the system coupled to \u03c1. For example, the\ndecay of a cavity field to which an atom is coupled is described by setting \u03ba to be the\ncavity field decay rate and \u0109 the annihilation operator, more commonly denoted \u00e2, of\nthe cavity field; \u0109\u2020 , or \u00e2\u2020 , is then the corresponding creation operator. This description\nis used in Section 2.6, as adapted from the literature (see, in particular, Ref. [39]), in\nour semiclassical exploration of the mirror-mediated cooling mechanism.\n2\n\nIt is perhaps interesting to note that Eq. (1.15) differs in sign from the Heisenberg equation of motion\nof an operator [27, Complement GIII ]. Mathematically, this is due to the operator ordering, of the\nform \u00db \u2020 \u0124 \u00db , used to transform from the Schr\u00f6dinger picture, where the state vector is time-dependent\nand observables correspond to time-independent operators, to the Heisenberg picture, where only the\nobservables are time-dependent.\n\n3\n\nFormally, the Lindblad terms arise upon tracing the master equation Eq. (1.16) over the bath variables.\n\n\f12\n\nAtom\u2013field interactions\n\nThe result embodied in Eqs. (1.17) and (1.18) is surprisingly independent of the properties of the bath, or environment, that gives rise to the incoherent processes. The reader is\nreferred to Ref. [37], especially Ch. 5, for more discussion about this point. Throughout\nthis thesis, we will assume: (i) weak coupling between the system and the bath, (ii) that\nthe dynamics is Markovian [40, Ch. 3], (iii) that the rotating wave approximation (see\nSection 1.3.2) is a valid approximation, and (iv) that the bath is effectively at zero\ntemperature. These assumptions are crucial in deriving Eq. (1.18).\nWe now introduce what we shall refer to as the two-level atom (TLA). This is a system\nthat is assumed to have two levels, a ground state |gi labelled 'g' and an excited state\n|ei labelled 'e'. In terms of the atomic model we introduced in Section 1.1, a TLA\n\ncan be emulated by a J = 0 \u2192 J 0 = 1 transition pumped by purely positive-handed\ncircularly polarised light, such that only the mJ = 0 and mJ 0 = 1 sublevels are coupled.\nIn the so-called D transitions of the alkali atoms, atoms can be made to cycle between\ntwo hyperfine levels in exactly the same fashion. Whilst the TLA is an idealisation,\ntherefore, it can be approximated quite well in the laboratory.\nA justification of Eq. (1.17) is provided in Ref. [37, \u00a71.5; see Eq. (1.5.39)] for the case\nof a TLA coupled to the radiation field. Such a description encompasses stimulated\nabsorption and emission as well as spontaneous emission processes.\n\n1.3\n\nThe Optical Bloch Equations\n\nThe Optical Bloch Equations (OBE) are a set of equations that explore the behaviour\nof the elements of \u03c1 when a TLA interacts with an incident harmonic electric field.\nTo derive the OBE, we start off from the Hamiltonian of a TLA at rest in a radiation\nfield [32]:\n\u0124 = \u0124A + \u0124R + \u0124I .\n\n(1.19)\n\nThe terms on the right-hand side of the above equation are the Hamiltonian of: the\natom, the quantised radiation field, and the interaction between the atom and the field,\nrespectively. Let us now assume that the energy difference between |gi and |ei is equal to\n\n~\u03c90 , including any level shifts due to coupling to the quantised field. We can immediately\n\nwrite down \u0124A = ~\u03c90 |eihe|, where we have taken the ground state as defining zero\nenergy. The interaction Hamiltonian has two contributions, \u0124I,i arising from the incident\n\n\f13\n\nAtom\u2013field interactions\n\nelectric field and \u0124I,q arising from the quantised field, which we will henceforth assume\nto be initially in the vacuum state, denoted |0i. Let us consider these two contributions\nseparately.\n\n1.3.1\n\nInteraction with the quantised field\n\nThe density matrix of the TLA interacting with the quantised field evolves according to\n\u03c1\u0307 =\n\n1\ni~ [H A\n\n+ H R + H I,q , \u03c1] ,\n\n(1.20)\n\nFollowing the standard procedure outlined in the literature (see, for example, Ref. [32,\n\u00a7V.A]), we may derive the following equations for the density matrix elements:\n\u03c1\u0307gg = 2\u0393\u03c1ee ,\n\n(1.21a)\n\n\u03c1\u0307ee = \u22122\u0393\u03c1ee ,\n\n(1.21b)\n\n\u03c1\u0307ge = i\u03c90 \u03c1ge \u2212 \u0393\u03c1ge , and\n\n(1.21c)\n\n\u03c1\u0307eg = \u2212i\u03c90 \u03c1eg \u2212 \u0393\u03c1eg .\n\n(1.21d)\n\nThe first pair of these equations describes the decay, with a time constant 2\u0393,4 of atoms\nin the excited state to the ground state by means of spontaneous emission. The second\npair describes the harmonic evolution, at a frequency \u03c90 , and decay of the coherences\nof the atom.\nSpontaneous emission as an irreversible process is a result of the coupling of the atomic\ndipole to the infinity of quantised vacuum modes in free space. It can therefore be\ndescribed as an incoherent process using Lindblad terms. The decay terms in the above\nequations can be derived by adapting Eq. (1.18) for the coupling between the atom\nand the vacuum field. In this case, \u03ba \u2192 \u0393, and \u0109 \u2192 |gihe| is the lowering operator.\nEqs. (1.21) then follow if we assume that the TLA, effectively, has infinite mass and\nsuffers no momentum recoil from spontaneous emission.\n4\n\nThis differs from standard notation by a factor of 2; our \u0393 is frequently denoted \u03b3 in the literature.\nWe use this notation for simplicity of presentation and consistency with Refs. [41] and [42].\n\n\f14\n\nAtom\u2013field interactions\n\n1.3.2\n\nInteraction with the incident field\n\nAtoms and molecules, whose sizes are usually in the range of 10\u221210 \u201310\u22129 m, are much\nsmaller than the wavelength of visible electromagnetic radiation (ca. 400\u2013800 \u00d7 10\u22129 m)\nand the spatial variation of the electric field over the extent of the electron cloud can\ntherefore be neglected. Several cases violate this criterion, such as the interaction of\nhighly excited Rydberg atoms with visible radiation, but we will only consider cases\nwhere we can make this long-wavelength assumption. We can thus write the interaction\nbetween the atom and the radiation field, by modelling the atom as a point dipole, as\n\u0124I,i = \u2212d * E [32], where d is the dipole moment of the atom and E = E 0 cos(\u03c9L t)\n\b\nthe incident electric field at the position of the atom. In the basis |gi, |ei , d is a\n\nHermitian matrix having only off-diagonal elements.5 We define the Rabi frequency \u03a9\nof the interaction:\n\u03a9 = \u2212 ~1 deg * E 0 ,\n\n(1.22)\n\nwith deg = he|d|gi as usual. By a suitable choice of phase we can ensure that \u03a9 is real,\nin which case d is a symmetric matrix; however, we will keep the rest of this chapter\ngeneral and do not make this simplification. The evolution of the density matrix under\nthe influence of this interaction is given by\n\u03c1\u0307 =\n\n1\ni~ [\u2212d\n\n* E 0 cos(\u03c9L t), \u03c1] ,\n\n(1.23)\n\nwhich can be expanded to\n\n5\n\n\u0001\n\u03c1\u0307gg = \u2212i \u03a9\u2217 \u03c1eg \u2212 \u03a9\u03c1ge cos(\u03c9L t) ,\n\u0001\n\u03c1\u0307ee = i \u03a9\u2217 \u03c1eg \u2212 \u03a9\u03c1ge cos(\u03c9L t) ,\n\u0001\n\u03c1\u0307ge = \u2212i\u03a9\u2217 \u03c1ee \u2212 \u03c1gg cos(\u03c9L t) , and\n\u0001\n\u03c1\u0307eg = i\u03a9 \u03c1ee \u2212 \u03c1gg cos(\u03c9L t) .\n\nThe dipole operator has odd parity and its diagonal elements are therefore zero.\n\n(1.24a)\n(1.24b)\n(1.24c)\n(1.24d)\n\n\f15\n\nAtom\u2013field interactions\n\nIn the same basis as before, we can write the atomic dipole d = deg |eihg| + dge |gihe|.\n\u0002\n\u0003\nWe can also rewrite cos(\u03c9L t) = 12 exp(i\u03c9L t) + exp(\u2212i\u03c9L t) . Then, we have\n\u0002\n\u2212 d * E = 21 ~ \u03a9|eihg| exp(\u2212i\u03c9L t) + \u03a9\u2217 |gihe| exp(i\u03c9L t)\n\n\u0003\n+ \u03a9|eihg| exp(\u2212i\u03c9L t) + \u03a9\u2217 |gihe| exp(i\u03c9L t) . (1.25)\n\nThe first two terms inside the brackets in the above expression are resonant when \u03c9L\nis close to \u03c90 . They describe the raising of the atomic energy level from |gi to |ei by\nabsorption of a photon or the lowering of the energy level from |ei to |gi accompanied by\nthe emission of a photon.

These three parameters are all real, since \u03c1 is Hermitian, and can be\n\nused to describe the coherent evolution of the state of the atom geometrically, with the\n'Bloch' vector (u, v, w) describing a path on the so-called Bloch Sphere. We will not be\nconcerned with the Bloch Sphere in this thesis but will use u, v and w as a shortcut to\nderiving some results in this section.\nIf an atom is moving at not too fast a speed, say its velocity v is such that \u03c4i |v|, \u03c4L |v| \u001c\n\u03bbL , with \u03c4L = 2\u03c0/\u03c9L being the duration of an optical period of the incident radiation,\n\b\n\u03bbL = 2\u03c0c/\u03c9L its wavelength, and \u03c4i = min (2\u0393)\u22121 , \u03a9\u22121 the timescale for the internal\nevolution of the atom, then we can assume that at each point in time the internal\n\nvariables of the atom-represented by \u03c1\u0303 or, equivalently, (u, v, w)-will reach a state of\nequilibrium [32]. In other words, we need only concern ourselves with the steady-state\nvalue of \u03c1\u0303 \u2261 \u03c1\u0303st (this process is known as adiabatic elimination [43] of the external\nvariables). Let us substitute u, v and w for the matrix elements of \u03c1\u0303 in Eqs. (1.27), and\nlet us set all the time derivatives to zero. Then we can write\n\u0001\nu\u0307 = 0 = \u22122\u0393ust + 2\u2206L v st \u2212 \u03a9\u2217 \u2212 \u03a9 wst ,\n\u0001\nv\u0307 = 0 = \u22122\u2206L ust \u2212 2\u0393v st \u2212 \u03a9\u2217 + \u03a9 wst , and\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u1e87 = 0 = 12 i \u03a9\u2217 \u2212 \u03a9 ust + 21 \u03a9\u2217 + \u03a9 v st \u2212 2\u0393wst \u2212 \u0393 ,\n\n(1.28a)\n(1.28b)\n(1.28c)\n\nwith the superscript 'st' again denoting steady-state values.

For\n1\nst\nvery large s, we have \u03c1\u0303st\ngg , \u03c1\u0303ee \u2248 2 , in which case the population is evenly distributed\nst\nbetween the two states, and \u03c1\u0303st\nge , \u03c1\u0303eg \u2248 0, so that the coherences between the two states\n\nst\nessentially disappear. Conversely, for very small s, we have \u03c1\u0303st\ngg \u2248 1 and \u03c1\u0303ee \u2248 0; i.e.,\n\npractically the entire atomic population is in the ground state, and in the limit of small\ns we have\n\u03c1\u0303st\nge =\n\n\u03a9/2\n\u03a9\u2217 /2\nand \u03c1\u0303st\n=\n.\neg\n\u2206L \u2212 i\u0393\n\u2206L + i\u0393\n\n(1.30)\n\nThe average value of the (induced) atomic dipole moment in the steady state is given\nby\n\u0001\n\b\nhdi = Tr \u03c1st d = 2 Re \u03c1st\neg dge\n\u001b\n\u001a \u2217\n1\n\u03a9 /2\n\u2212i\u03c9L t\ndge e\n.\n= 2 Re\n\u2206L + i\u0393 1 + s\n\n(1.31)\n\nWe can assume that the induced atomic dipole moment is aligned, in space, with the\nincident electric field, at which point we can set dge = |dge |ei\u03c6 , with \u03c6 being some phase,\n\nand dge * E 0 = |dge |E0 ei\u03c6 , such that\n\n\u001a\n\u001b\n1 |dge |2 e2i\u03c6 1\n\u2212i\u03c9L t\nhdi = Re \u2212\nE0 e\n.\n~ \u2206L + i\u0393 1 + s\n\n(1.32)\n\n\b\nLet \u03c7 be the (complex) polarisability of the atom, whereby hdi = \u000f0 Re \u03c7E0 e\u2212i\u03c9L t [44],\n\u000f0 being the vacuum permittivity. It can be verified by direct calculation that, within\nthe RWA, Re{d * E} = Re{d} * Re{E}; this justifies the form of the equation in the\npreceding sentence.

Let us\nnow simplify this expression. First, consider Eq. (1.29b), which describes the population\nin the excited state, and note that atoms in the excited state decay at a rate 2\u0393, as also\n\n\f18\n\nAtom\u2013field interactions\nimplied by Eq.

We can use the definitions of the Rabi frequency \u03a9, Eq. (1.22),\nand Isat to obtain\n|he|d|gi|2 =\n\nc\u000f0 \u03932 ~2\n.\nIsat\n\n(1.36)\n\nThe scattered power is given by ~\u03c9L R. Let us now define \u03c3a \u2261 ~\u03c9L R/I = ~\u03c9L \u0393/Isat on\nresonance and in the limit of low incident power. Thus, \u03c3a corresponds to the scattering,\nor radiative, cross-section (the scattered power divided by the incident energy flux) when\n\u2206L = 0 and I \u001c Isat . But then,\n|he|d|gi|2\n\u03c3a c\n\u03bb \u03c3a\n=\n\u0393=\n\u0393 , or\n\u000f0 ~\n\u03c9L\n\u03c0 2\n\u03c7=\u2212\n\n1\n1\n\u03bb \u03c3a\n\u0393\n1\n\u03c3a c\n\u0393\n=\u2212\n.\n\u03c9L \u2206L + i\u0393 1 + s\n\u03c0 2 \u2206L + i\u0393 1 + s\n\n(1.37)\n\n(1.38)\n\nIt can also be shown that \u03c3a = 3\u03bb2 /(2\u03c0) [46, \u00a768.6], which allows us to relate \u03c7 to known\nquantities. We will use the linear polarisability \u03c7 to define the dimensionless 'scattering\nparameter'7 \u03b6. Indeed, let us first look at the 1D wave equation, along the z axis, for a\nmonochromatic plane wave incident normally on a polarisable plane at z = 0 [44, 47]:\n\u0010\n\n\u22022\n\u2202z 2\n\n\u0011\n+ k 2 E = \u2212k 2 \u03b7\u03c7\u03b4(z)E ,\n\n(1.39)\n\nwith \u03b4(z) being the Dirac \u03b4-function, k = 2\u03c0/\u03bb the wavenumber of the wave and \u03b7\nthe density of the particles making up the plane per unit area. If the wave interacts\nwith one particle, then we can effectively set \u03b7 = 1/\u03c3L , \u03c3L being the mode area of the\n(possibly focussed) wave. In situations where the atom is at the focus of an extremely\ntightly-focussed wave, however, this approximation breaks down [48] and we effectively\nhave \u03b7 < 1/\u03c3L ; we will henceforth assume that the atom is not in the centre of such a\n7\n\nWe will refer to \u03b6 as 'polarisability' throughout-the linear relation between \u03c7 and \u03b6, as well as the\ncontext, allows us to do this without giving rise to any ambiguity. \u03c7 is perhaps more correctly referred\nto as a 'susceptibility'.\n\n\f19\n\nAtom\u2013field interactions\ntightly-focussed beam.\nBy defining \u03b6 = 12 k\u03b7\u03c7, and making use of the boundary conditions [47]\nE\n\u2202\n\u2202z E\n\n\u0001\n\nz\u21920\u2212\n\nz\u21920\u2212\n\n\u2212\n\n=E\n\n\u2202\n\u2202z E\n\n\u0001\n\nz\u21920+\n\nz\u21920+\n\n, and\n\u0010\n= 2k\u03b6 E\n\n(1.40a)\n\nz=0\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n(1.40b)\n\nobtained by integrating the wave equation over a small interval centred at z = 0, we can\nshow that the complex (amplitude) reflection and transmission coefficients are\nr=\n\ni\u03b6\n1\nand t =\n,\n1 \u2212 i\u03b6\n1 \u2212 i\u03b6\n\n(1.41)\n\nrespectively. The polarisability of a TLA can therefore be written [42]\n\u03b6=\u2212\n\n\u0393\n1\n\u03c3a\n\u0393\n\u03c3a\n, or \u03b6 = \u2212\n,\n2\u03c3L \u2206L + i\u0393 1 + s\n2\u03c3L \u2206L + i\u0393\n\n(1.42)\n\nwhere the low-intensity (s \u2192 0) limit is taken at the end; we will be concerned with\nthis limit in the subsequent work. This form of \u03b6 is independent of the system of\nunits (SI or CGS) used and expresses the polarisability of the TLA as a dimensionless\nnumber. One of the advantages of this formalism is that \u03b6 can take, at the outset, any\ncomplex value. For far-detuned atoms, for example, \u03b6 is approximately real, while on\nresonance it is purely imaginary. Going a step further, we can use this parameter as\nan abstract quantity representing a general 1D 'scatterer' with (amplitude) reflectivity\nr and transmissivity t, noting that for real \u03b6 the scatterer absorbs none of the incident\nenergy (|r|2 + |t|2 = 1). In Part II we will apply this concept to form a very physical\nlink between the cooling of atoms in radiation fields and optomechanics, which concerns\nitself with the manipulation of mesoscopic optical elements using light.\nLet us make some final comments about Eq. (1.42). First of all, as can easily be verified,\nthis definition for \u03b6 obeys the Kramers\u2013Kronig relations [49]. However, if we rewrite\n\u03b6(\u03c9) = \u2212\n\n\u03c3a\n\u0393\n,\n2\u03c3L \u03c9 \u2212 \u03c90 + i\u0393\n\n(1.43)\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\u2217\nwhereby \u03b6 = \u03b6(\u03c9L ) in Eq. (1.42), we can immediately see that \u03b6(\u2212\u03c9) 6= \u03b6(\u03c9) . This\n\nimmediately leads to problems. For let us assume that, in the time domain, \u03b6(t) is real,\nwhich is equivalent to asserting that hdi in Eq. (1.31) is real. Then, using the definition\n\n\f20\n\nAtom\u2013field interactions\nof the Fourier transform,\n\u03b6(\u03c9) =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212i\u03c9t\n\ne\n\n\u03b6(t) dt , so that \u03b6(\u2212\u03c9) =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\u2217\nei\u03c9t \u03b6(t) dt = \u03b6(\u03c9) ;\n\n(1.44)\n\nsomething is not right in our definition of \u03b6. Indeed, a more rigorous treatment ignoring\nthe RWA gives [50]\n\u03c3a\n\u03b6(\u03c9) = \u2212\n2\u03c3L\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0393\n\u0393\n\u2212\n\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c90 + i\u0393 \u03c9 + \u03c90 + i\u0393\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(1.45)\n\nwhich satisfies the aforementioned equality. In all cases we will be concerned with,\nhowever, |\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c90 |, \u0393 \u226a \u03c9, \u03c90 -the RWA is valid-in which case the second term in the\nabove expression can be safely neglected and Eq. (1.45) reduces to Eq. (1.43).\n\n1.5\n\nEnergy balance: Work done on a two-level atom\n\nConsider a small interval between a time t and a time t + dt, where dt is infinitesimally\nsmall. During this time interval, the electric field incident on the TLA can be taken to\nbe constant, E 0 cos(\u03c9L t), but the dipole moment of the TLA can change, say, due to\nthe more rapid motion of the atomic electrons. The rate of work done, averaged over an\noptical cycle, by the field on the dipole is then [44]\nP = E 0 cos(\u03c9L t) * h\u1e0bi\n= 2\u000f0 \u03c9L |E 0 |2 Im{\u03c7} .\n\n(1.46)\n\nBy making use of the definition of \u03c7, the OBE, and the assumption that \u03a9 is real, we\ncan show that P = 2~\u03c9L \u0393\u03c1st\nee . Physically, P is the average power absorbed by the atom.\nFor an atom at rest, this must be equal to the energy lost by the atom per unit time\nthrough scattering of photons. Dividing P by the energy per incident photon, ~\u03c9L , gives\nthe number of photons scattered per unit time by the atom, R = 2\u0393\u03c1st\nee . This justifies\nEq. (1.34).\nTwo facts emerge from Eq. (1.46) that are important for our discussion. First of all,\na TLA with real \u03c7 will experience no photon scattering, i.e., scattering is significantly\nsuppressed when \u2206L \u001d 2\u0393. Secondly, and more importantly, suppose that d is delayed\nwith respect to E. Then an extra phase factor, let us say \u03c6, appears in Eq. (1.46) such\n\n\f21\n\nAtom\u2013field interactions\n\n\b\nthat P = 2\u000f0 \u03c9L |E 0 |2 Im \u03c7ei\u03c6 . For \u03c6 6= 0, the real component of \u03c7 can also lead to\n\nexchange of energy between the TLA and the electric field. This is exploited in cooling\nmechanisms that rely on optical pumping in polarisation gradients (see, for example,\nSection 3.4 and Ref. [14] as well as the concluding remarks in the next section).\nA final remark can be made about the work done on a TLA in an optical potential.\nIndeed, the work done on a TLA undergoing small displacements in the field is not, in\ngeneral, equal to the change in the potential energy of the atom in the field [14] because\nthe energy in the electromagnetic field itself changes. The relation \"work done = change\nof potential energy\" is only valid for closed systems, and because the system we are\nconsidering is patently open (the light leaving the system carries away energy) we can\nnot expect these two quantities to be equal. Care must be taken, then, when deriving\nforces from gradients of optical potentials.\n\n1.6\n\nForces on a two-level atom\n\nUnder most circumstances, excluding of course Bose\u2013Einstein condensation and related\nphenomena, we can assume that the spread of the wavefunction of a TLA is much\nsmaller than the optical wavelength. The force on a TLA interacting with an incident\n\u0001\nfield is F = \u2207 hdi * E , evaluated at the position of the atom (r = 0); this follows from\n\u0002\n\u0003\nEhrenfest's theorem [32].

In\nthe following sections we will restrict ourselves to the limit of small s. This is useful\nin considering the interaction of a TLA with a standing wave. For small intensities,\nthe TLA behaves as if it interacts with the two running waves making up the standing\nwave independently. For very high intensities, the process of absorption of photons from\none running wave and stimulated emission into the other running wave can become\nimportant and modify the interaction significantly.\nAnother way of looking at this is to recall that the force is the gradient of the product\nof the induced dipole and the local electric field. The gradient operation is linear, so we\nneed not concern ourselves with its effects. However, suppose that the electric field at\nthe position of the TLA is a sum of two fields, E 1 + E 2 , with the corresponding induced\n\u0002\n\u0001\ndipole being equal to hd1 i + hd2 i. Then, the force on the TLA is \u2207 hd1 i + hd2 i * E 1 +\n\u0001\u0003\nE 2 , which has two extra terms in addition to the sum of the two independent forces,\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u2207 hd1 i * E 1 + \u2207 hd2 i * E 2 . If the spatial (temporal) average of these extra two terms\nover a wavelength is zero (this happens, e.g., when there is no coherence between the\n\ntwo electric fields), the two forces can therefore be computed separately and added to\ngive the total spatially (temporally) averaged force.\nLet us end this section with a note on the dipole force, which corresponds to the term\n\n\f23\n\nAtom\u2013field interactions\n\nin the force proportional to \u2207\u03a9 (the reactive force). Eq. (1.31) and Eq. (1.46) tell us\nthat only v st can give rise to a global exchange of energy between the TLA and the\nlight field. The reactive component of F above can, in fact, be derived from a potential.\nIn other words, the dipole force is conservative. This is not true in general, however.\nEmploying the same arguments as before, if hdi is delayed with respect to the field, a\n\ncomponent of v st enters the dipole force and it is therefore no longer constrained to be\nstrictly conservative.\n\n1.7\n\nThe Fluctuation\u2013Dissipation Theorem\n\nIn the case of the systems that we will investigate, the fluctuation\u2013dissipation theorem\nis a relation between the systematic (dissipative) and fluctuating components of a force\nacting on a particle. We shall make extensive use of this theorem in the form of Eq. (1.61)\nbelow.\nConsider a particle interacting with the radiation field, such that the force acting on the\nparticle, as a function of time, is F(t) = F0 (t) + FL (t), where the first term describes a\ncontinuous force that, for example, acts to dampen the particle's motion and the second\nterm is a Langevin force, which has a zero time average and describes the instantaneous\nfluctuations of the force about its average. In other words, hF(t)i = hF0 (t)i.8 Now,\nconsider\nhF(t)F(t0 )i = hF0 (t)F0 (t0 )i + hF0 (t)FL (t0 )i + hFL (t)F0 (t0 )i + hFL (t)FL (t0 )i\n= hF0 (t)ihF0 (t0 )i + hF0 (t)ihFL (t0 )i + hFL (t)ihF0 (t0 )i + hFL (t)FL (t0 )i\n= hF(t)ihF(t0 )i + hFL (t)FL (t0 )i ,\n\n(1.52)\n\nwhere the time average is taken on a timescale that is short with respect to the timescale\nfor variations in F0 (t) but long with respect to that for FL (t), whereby hF0 (t)FL (t0 )i =\nhF0 (t)ihFL (t0 )i = 0. The correlation function for FL (t) on this timescale is assumed to\nhave the form\nhFL (t)FL (t0 )i \u2248 D \u03b4(t \u2212 t0 ) ,\n8\n\n(1.53)\n\nA note about notation is due: in this section we use the angle brackets, h * i, to represent the average\nfor a classical force or the expectation value for a quantised force, depending on the nature of the\nforce.\n\n\f24\n\nAtom\u2013field interactions\nwhere D is some real number; i.e.,\nD \u03b4(t \u2212 t0 ) = hF(t)F(t0 )i \u2212 hF(t)ihF(t0 )i ,\n\n(1.54)\n\ncf.

The width of the momentum distribution is\nsimilarly given by \u03c3p2 (t) \u2248 Dt, whereby D is, by definition, the momentum diffusion\n\ncoefficient. For very long times we can make two observations. Firstly, hv(t)i = 0, so\n\nthat the particle is cooled to zero mean velocity; secondly, \u03c3v2 (t) = D/(2m%). We will not\ngo into any further depth here, but it can be shown [53] that all higher-order correlation\nfunctions vanish at long timescales. Moreover, this further implies that the velocity\n\u0002\n\u0003\ndistribution of an ensemble of such particles is Gaussian, of the form exp \u2212v 2 /(\u03c3v /2)2 ,\nwith the factor of\n\n1\n2\n\narising due to the symmetry of the distribution. Comparing this\n\nwith a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution in thermal equilibrium at temperature T , for\nwhich \u03c3v2 = kB T /(2m) with kB being the Boltzmann constant, we can therefore calculate\nthe equilibrium temperature of our particle:\nkB T =\n\nD\n.\n%\n\n(1.61)\n\nThis is in fact of the same form as that obtained by Einstein [54] in his discussion of the\nBrownian motion of particles suspended in a liquid. Eq. (1.61) links the fluctuating and\ndissipating forces experienced by the particle to its equilibrium temperature. Although\nthe justification given here is not completely general, namely in terms of demanding a\nlinear friction force and a constant momentum diffusion constant, Eq. (1.61) is a good\napproximation under most circumstances of interest. See Ref. [55] for a slightly more\ngeneral treatment, and Ref. [56] for a treatment based on the theory of quantum noise.9\nThe results above can easily be adapted for forces acting in 3D by replacing the forces F,\nF0 , FL with their vector counterparts F, F0 , FL ; replacing products of the type F(t)F 0 (t0 )\nwith F (t) * F 0 (t0 ) (F, F 0 = F, F0 , FL ); and also replacing v with v.\n9\n\nConsiderations related to the general quantum case imply the failure of the Onsager hypothesis,\nwhich states that \"the average regression of fluctuations will obey the same laws as the corresponding\nmacroscopic irreversible process\" [57], in cases such as where strong coupling between the system and\nthe noise bath is allowed. Put differently, the quantum regression theorem cannot be called a 'theorem'\nin the mathematical sense. See the discussions in Refs. [58] and [59] for further details.\n\n\f26\n\nAtom\u2013field interactions\n\nFigure 1.1: Prototypical '\u039b'\u2013type system used to describe stimulated Raman transitions. The transition between the ground states is taken to be dipole-forbidden.\n\n1.8\n\nBeyond two-level atoms\n\nThe two-level atom is a useful, but rather crude, approximation. As noted by Dalibard,\nReynaud and Cohen\u2013Tannoudji [60], amongst many others, several interesting physical\nmechanisms can only be explained when one includes the manifold of Zeeman sublevels,\nSection 1.1, that occur in the energy level structure of real atoms into the model. Indeed,\nthis manifold of sublevels can be included into the definition of the \u03b6, above, by generalising it into the polarisability tensor, defined as the steady-state expectation value of\nthe polarisability operator \u03b6\u0302,\n\u0001 X\n\u03b6 = Tr \u03c1\u0303st * \u03b6\u0302 =\nhj|\u03c1\u0303st |iihi|\u03b6\u0302|ji ,\n\n(1.62)\n\ni,j\n\nwhere \u03c1\u0303st , as defined previously, is the steady-state density matrix describing the system\nand the summation runs over all the internal sublevels of the atom. The matrix elements\nof the polarisability operator \u03b6\u0302, defined similarly to Eq. (14.9-24) of Ref. [30], read in\nthe general \u03bc, \u03bd basis\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\nX hi|d\u0302\u03bc |eihe|d\u0302\u03bc |ji hi|d\u0302\u03bc |eihe|d\u0302\u03bd |ji\n\uf8f0\n\uf8fb,\nhi|\u03b6\u0302|ji = \u03b60\nhi|d\u0302\u03bd |eihe|d\u0302\u03bc |ji hi|d\u0302\u03bd |eihe|d\u0302\u03bd |ji\ne\n\n(1.63)\n\nwhere \u03b60 embodies the dimensional constants and the frequency dependence of the polarisability of the atom (see, for example, Ref. [50]):\n\u03b60 = \u2212\n\nk\n1\n,\n2\u03c3L \u2206L + i\u0393\n\n(1.64)\n\nIn the above equation, the dipole moment operator d\u0302\u03bc (d\u0302\u03bd ) is related to the \u03bc (\u03bd)\npolarised light field and the sum runs over all the internal sublevels, e, of the atom. The\n\n\f27\n\nAtom\u2013field interactions\n\nmatrix elements of d\u0302\u03bc (d\u0302\u03bd ) are given by the appropriate Clebsch\u2013Gordan coefficients.\nWe will explore the implications of this generalised polarisability tensor in Part II, where\nit will be used to give an alternative derivation of Sisyphus cooling [14].\nStimulated Raman transitions [29] also require multilevel atoms by their very definition.\nThe basic model for an atom undergoing a stimulated Raman transition is a three-level\n'\u039b'\u2013type level system (Fig. 1.1): an atom having two 'ground' states |g1 i and |g2 i, and\none excited state |ei. The transition between |g1 i and |g2 i is always dipole-forbidden,10\n\ndue to parity conservation, and the remaining two transitions are coupled by 'Pump'\n(|g1 i \u2194 |ei) and 'Stokes' (|g2 i \u2194 |ei) fields, characterised by strengths \u03a9P and \u03a9S ,\nrespectively. For simplicity, we assume that both coupling fields have a detuning \u2206\nfrom resonance. Under these conditions, Rabi oscillations occur between the two ground\nstates at an effective frequency [61]\n|\u03a9P \u03a9\u2217S |\n.\n2\u2206\n\n(1.65)\n\nIt has often been assumed in the literature (see, for example, Ref. [62, \u00a72.1]), that\nthe hyperfine structure of |ei can easily be taken into account by summing over the\nappropriate multiple routes, giving an effective Rabi frequency\nX |\u03a9P;i \u03a9\u2217S;i |\ni\n\n2\u2206\n\n,\n\n(1.66)\n\nwhere the label i denotes the coupling to the ith sublevel of |ei, and \u2206 is assumed\nto be much larger than the energy splittings between the different sublevels. Indeed,\nit was only in a recent publication by Bateman, Xuereb and Freegarde [61] that this\nwas proven mathematically to be the case in general, by diagonalising the appropriate\nmultilevel Hamiltonian.\nFor completeness, we will now briefly go through the main arguments in Ref. [61]. This\nwork was originally published as Bateman, J., Xuereb, A., & Freegarde, T., Phys. Rev. A\n81, 043808 (2010).11 The energy structure of the atom we consider is a straightforward\nextension of that shown in Fig. 1.1, where we maintain the two ground states |g1 i and\n10\n\nIn other words, an atom in one of the |gi i states will remain in that state, justifying their designation\nas 'ground' states.\n\n11\n\nJB set up the problem, solved the three-level system case, provided the interpretation and wrote\nthe paper; AX produced the analytical formulation of the eigensystem of the general (N + 2)-level\nHamiltonian.\n\n\f28\n\nAtom\u2013field interactions\n\n|g2 i, but where a similar hyperfine structure is taken to exist for the excited state-the\nstate |ei splits into |e1 i, |e2 i, . . . , |eN i, say. The coupling between the two beams and the\ndifferent excited sublevels may not be identical, and we therefore set \u03a9P;i and \u03a9S;i to be,\nrespectively, the coupling strengths for the transitions |g1 i \u2194 |ei i and |g2 i \u2194 |ei i.

We solve the Schr\u00f6dinger equation with this Hamiltonian by using unitary\ntransformations to find a basis where the time evolution of the states is simple and the\ntransformed Hamiltonian is diagonal.

[...] [I]n general one restricts oneself\nto a discussion of the energy exchange, without taking the momentum change into\naccount. One feels easily justified in this, because the smallness of the impulses\ntransmitted by the radiation field implies that these can almost always be neglected\nin practice [...].\nA. Einstein, Physikalische Zeitschrift 18, 121 (1917)\n\nThe general description given previously of the forces acting on two-level atoms allows\nthe exploration of a number of laser trapping and cooling configurations currently used.\nIn particular, I will look at dipole traps in Section 2.1, optical molasses in Section 2.2,\nand the magneto\u2013optical trap (MOT) in Section 2.3. Following these, I will discuss a\nmore recent attempt at a generally applicable laser cooling method, so-called 'mirrormediated cooling', Section 2.6, which naturally lends itself to being extended in various\nways, as shall be seen in Section 2.7 and Part II.\n\n2.1\n\nDipole traps\n\nWe have already remarked that the 'reactive force' in Eq. (1.51a) is often called the\ndipole force. The dipole force is proportional to the gradient of the magnitude of the\nRabi frequency and is therefore sensitive to spatial nonuniformities in the electric field\nintensity that the atom is interacting with. In other words, an atom immersed in a\ntightly focussed light field will experience a force that attracts it to, or repels it from,\n\n32\n\n\fTrapping and cooling atoms\n\n33\n\nthe focus. Specifically, if \u2206L < 0 the force will point towards increasing light intensity;\nconversely if \u2206L > 0, the force points away from the focus. In the former case, the atom\ncan be trapped at the focus of the beam, whereas in the latter case configurations can\nbe found having a field minimum at some point in space [63], raising the possibility of\ntrapping the atom in such regions.\nThe dipole force is a very general mechanism; it applies not only to TLAs, as explained\nin the preceding paragraph, but to any object that has a nonzero polarisability. Let us\nconsider an object with an induced dipole moment d interacting with an electric field\nE. Then, the object will experience a (dipole) potential U = \u2212d * E. This potential then\ngives rise to the dipole force F = \u2212\u2207U in a manner similar to the force experienced by\na TLA. We note that this derivation of F implies that the dipole force is conservative;\nessentially identical arguments to those used when describing the TLA in Section 1.6\nhold in the general case too, whereby a delay between d and E can give rise to a\nnonconservative term in the dipole force.\nThis universality inherent in the dipole force makes it a very versatile experimental\ntool. It has been used to trap atoms in free space [64] and cavities [65], manipulate\nmicrospheres [66], viruses and even living cells [67]; it is also essential in achieving fully\noptical Bose\u2013Einstein condensation [68].\n\n2.2\n\nOptical molasses\n\nOptical molasses historically provided the first proof that purely optical mechanisms can\nbe used to slow down the motion of ensembles of atoms [12]. Let us see how optical\nmolasses work by looking at the behaviour of a TLA inside a standing wave composed\nof two weak (s \u001c 1) counterpropagating travelling waves. Eq. (1.51a) is again the key\nto exploring this interaction. For each travelling wave, having a propagation vector \u00b1k\n[i.e., \u03c6(r) = \u00b1k * r], we can easily see that \u2207\u03a9 = 0-we are thus only concerned with\nthe dissipative force-and \u2207\u03c6(r) = \u00b1k. Adding the two forces together thus seems to\ngive a zero net force, but this is only because the Doppler shift has not yet been taken\ninto account. Indeed, the frequency for the \u00b1k wave is seen by the atom to be shifted\nby \u00b1k * v, i.e., \u2206L \u2192 \u2206L \u00b1 k * v. In effect, then, the total force seen by the atom is\n\n\f34\n\nTrapping and cooling atoms\ntherefore\nFOM = \u2212\n\u2248\n\n~\u03a92 \u0393/2\n~\u03a92 \u0393/2\nk+\nk\n\u00012\n\u00012\n\u2206L + k * v + \u0393 2\n\u2206L \u2212 k * v + \u03932\n\n2~\u03a92 \u2206L \u0393\n\u00012 (k * v)k\n\u22062L + \u03932\n\n=\n\n2~\u03a92 \u2206L \u0393\n\u00012 (k \u2297 k)v ,\n\u22062L + \u03932\n\n(2.1)\n\n\u000e\n\u0001\nwith the approximation holding only up to linear order in k * v\u0393 \u22062L + \u03932 , and the\nvector outer product being defined as\n\n\uf8eb \uf8f6 \uf8eb \uf8f6 \uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n2\nk\nk\nk\nk1 k2 k1 k3\n\uf8ec 1\uf8f7 \uf8ec 1\uf8f7 \uf8ef 1\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ec \uf8f7 \uf8ec \uf8f7 \uf8ef\n\uf8fa\nk \u2297 k = \uf8eck2 \uf8f7 \u2297 \uf8eck2 \uf8f7 = \uf8efk1 k2 k22 k2 k3 \uf8fa .\n\uf8ed \uf8f8 \uf8ed \uf8f8 \uf8f0\n\uf8fb\n2\nk3\nk3\nk1 k3 k2 k3 k3\n\n(2.2)\n\nLet us now constrain ourselves to one dimension, whereby F, v, k \u2192 F, v, k. For every\nphoton absorption or emission event that the atom undergoes, it experiences a momentum change ~k; this process occurs at a rate 2R, with the factor of 2 arising because\nof the presence of the two identical beams, and R given by Eq. (1.34). Thus, over\nsmall times t, we have (\u03b4p)2 /t = 2~2 k 2 R. Identifying \u03b4p = \u03c3p (t), we therefore have the\ndiffusion and cooling coefficients,\nD = 2~2 k 2 R =\n\n2~k 2 \u03a92 \u2206L \u0393\n~2 k 2 \u03a92\n,\nand\n%\n=\n\u2212\n\u00012 ,\n\u22062L + \u03932\n\u22062 + \u0393 2\n\n(2.3)\n\nL\n\nrespectively (cf. Ref. [52]), whereby the equilibrium temperature of the atom is given\nby\n~\u0393\nT =\n2kB\n\n\u0012\n\n|\u2206L |\n\u0393\n+\n\u0393\n|\u2206L |\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhich only makes sense for \u2206L < 0. T attains its lower bound, known as the Doppler\ntemperature TD , when \u2206L = \u2212\u0393, at which point\nTD =\n\n~\u0393\n.\nkB\n\n(2.5)\n\nRemarkably, this limiting temperature is independent of the atom's mass m or the\nintensity of the light beam (recall, however, that we have assumed s \u001c 1).\nA more fundamental limit than the Doppler temperature is due to what is called the\n\n\f35\n\nTrapping and cooling atoms\n\nrecoil limit; this gives rise to the recoil temperature TR . Any time an atom absorbs\nor emits a photon, it undergoes a momentum change of magnitude \u2206p = ~k. As such,\nthen, the momentum of the atom can be described as a discrete one-dimensional random\nwalk of step size \u00b1~k. After n steps in such a walk, the momentum p = Sn ~k of the\nP\natom is described by the quantity Sn = ni=1 ci , where each ci = \u00b11. The statistics of\nSn obeys\n\nhSn i =\n\nn\nX\ni=1\n\nh\u00b11i = 0 and hSn2 i =\n\nn\nX\nh(\u00b11)2 i = n ,\n\n(2.6)\n\ni=1\n\nwhereby\n\u0001\n\u03c3p2 = hSn2 i \u2212 hSn i2 (~k)2 = n(~k)2 ,\n\n(2.7)\n\nsuch that the momentum diffusion experienced by the atom is D = (~k)2 (n/t); the\nquantity (n/t) has to be interpreted as the rate at which photons interact with the\natom. The recoil limit applies to any cooling process involving scattering of photons,\nand therefore at least one scattering event has to occur on average during such a process.\nThe minimum value for \u03c3p is therefore achieved when n = 1; \u03c3p = (~k)2 . Assuming the\nmomentum distribution is Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann,1 this corresponds to a temperature\nTR =\nFor a\n\n85 Rb\n\n~2 k 2\n.\n2kB m\n\n(2.8)\n\natom cycling on the D2 transition, TD = 146 \u03bcK and TR = 185 nK (see\n\nRef. [35], but their definition of the recoil temperature is a factor of 2 larger than ours;\nwe use a definition consistent with, e.g., Ref. [71]). Not even the recoil limit is a hard\nlimit, though, with several schemes-such as evaporative cooling [72], and even alloptical schemes like velocity-selective coherent population trapping [71]-being devised\nto overcome it. Such schemes generally work by ensuring that the target state is subject\nto much less than one scattering event, on the average.\n\n2.3\n\nMagneto\u2013optical traps\n\nTo describe MOTs, we have to give up the TLA model we have pursued throughout\nmost of the preceding sections and appeal to the multilevel structure of realistic atoms.\n1\n\nThis assumption is not very well-founded; ensembles close to, or below, the recoil limit generally obey\ndifferent statistics (see, for example, Refs. [69] and [70], and Fig. 2 in Ref. [71]). Nonetheless, in the\nabsence of well-definition, assuming Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann statistics allows us to assign a 'temperature'\nto such an ensemble.\n\n\fTrapping and cooling atoms\n\n36\n\nIn particular, let us consider a J = 1 \u2192 J 0 = 2 transition.2 Our description of the\ncooling mechanism that dominates in a MOT will be cursory here-to present a unified\napproach to laser cooling, we will in Section 3.4 treat this type of cooling using an\nextended form of the transfer matrix method that will be introduced in Part II.\nThe 'sub-Doppler' cooling mechanism in a MOT relies on the phenomenon of optical\npumping between the multiple magnetic sublevels in the ground (J = 1) state. Let us\nassume that the atom is interacting with two counterpropagating travelling waves of\nidentical frequencies but opposite circular polarisations; this is often referred to as the\n\u03c3 + \u2013\u03c3 \u2212 configuration. The resulting standing wave pattern is linearly polarised everywhere, but this linear polarisation rotates in space on the wavelength scale. Consider\nnow a ground-state static atom in such a field. Optical pumping processes between\ndifferent magnetic sublevels of the J = 1 level proceed at rates given by the various\nClebsch\u2013Gordan coefficients for the transitions involved. We note that this mechanism\nrelies on pumping between these magnetic sublevels and therefore needs a ground state\nwith J \u2265 1. The physics behind cooling in this configuration [14] is rather involved\nbut we can summarise it as follows. In its rest frame, an atom moving with (constant)\nvelocity sees a linear polarisation rotating with a constant angular velocity which, by\nLarmor's theorem, acts like a fictitious magnetic field parallel to the motion of the atom.\nThis magnetic field acts to effectively couple the magnetic sublevels of the ground state.\nThe motion of the atom also induces an imbalance in the populations of these sublevels,\ncausing it to preferentially scattering photons from one of the two running waves. It\ncan be shown that, under the right conditions, this preferential scattering can lead to a\nsignificant friction force acting on the atom, enough to cool a population of such atoms\nto well below the Doppler temperature [13\u201315].\nWe can now describe the theory of operation of MOTs. A MOT is formed at the zero\nof a quadrupole magnetic field; let us use this magnetic field to define our coordinate\nsystem: the z-axis points along the axis of symmetry of this magnetic field and the\nx and y axes define what we will call the 'symmetry plane'. The origin of our coordinate system will be taken at the zero of the magnetic field. Traditionally, a MOT\nrequires three pairs of counterpropagating red-detuned circularly-polarised beams, one\npair along each of the coordinate axes. The beams in the symmetry plane all have the\nsame helicity, and opposite to that of the beams along the z-axis. The polarisation of\n2\n\nWe use the standard notation here, with J denoting the ground state and J 0 the excited state.\n\n\fTrapping and cooling atoms\n\n37\n\nFigure 2.1: Close to the centre of a magneto\u2013optical trap, the magnetic field has a\nconstant gradient, taken here to be positive along the positive x direction. An atom\nto the right of the origin will see the \u03c3 + beam as further detuned than the \u03c3 \u2212 beam,\neven though both have the same frequency \u03c9L , and therefore preferentially scatter from\nthe latter, causing it to experience a restoring force towards x = 0. A similar principle\noperates when the atom is to the left of the origin, whereby it will preferentially scatter\nfrom the \u03c3 + beam. We depict a J = 0 \u2192 J 0 = 1 transition here. The designation \u03c3 \u00b1\nrelates to the effective circular polarisation of the light, and not its helicity.\n\nthe beams is as yet undetermined; sub-Doppler cooling occurs for either configuration,\ndepending on the sign of the detuning of the cooling light from the atomic transition.\nThis degree of freedom is therefore fixed by choosing whether to operate above or below\natomic resonance.\nWe have thus far discussed only the cooling mechanism in a MOT. Trapping in a MOT\noperates as follows. Let us suppose that the magnetic field is such that the gradient\nis positive in the x direction, and consider a static atom with a positive x coordinate.\nDue to the nonzero magnetic field, the energy levels of the atom will be split. We will\nnow, for simplicity, consider an atom with a J = 0 ground state (similar conclusions will\nhold for J 6= 0). The atom is in a region where the magnetic field strength is positive;\nin other words, the \u2206mJ = \u22121 (\u2206mJ = +1) transition is shifted to a lower (higher)\nenergy; this statement follows from Eq. (1.5). If the counterpropagating beam (i.e., the\nbeam from the positive x direction) is \u03c3 \u2212 polarised, whereby the opposite beam is \u03c3 +\npolarised, the atom will preferentially scatter photons from the positive x direction and\ntherefore experience a force towards the origin; see Fig. 2.1. Conversely, if the magnetic\nfield gradient is negative in the x direction, we require the beam from the positive x\ndirection to be \u03c3 + polarised.\n\n\fTrapping and cooling atoms\n\n2.4\n\n38\n\nMemory-based approach to cooling in laser light: the\ndipole force delayed3\n\nWe have stated previously that the dipole force, in its 'bare' form, is a conservative force,\nbut if we introduce a delay between the dipole moment of our particle and the field that\nthe particle interacts with, this restriction evaporates and the dipole force gains a nonconservative character [73]. In the atomic domain, this is generally referred to as a\n'Sisyphus'\u2013type cooling mechanism, following the nomenclature first applied by Aspect\nand co-workers [74] with reference to the ancient Greek myth. We will now generalise\nthis idea and see that it leads us to several potentially promising cooling configurations\nthat rely solely upon the dipole force.\nIn the previous section we considered 'standard' Sisyphus cooling. A similar mechanism\ncan be seen to act for atoms inside optical resonators [75]. Let us consider a simplified\nmodel of a resonant optical resonator having almost perfect mirrors. The electric field\ninside the resonator is, to a very good approximation, a sinusoidal standing wave. If one\nintroduces an atom into the resonator, the effect that the atom has on the resonator\nwill depend greatly on its position in this standing wave. An atom at a node of the field\nwill not affect the field, whereas an atom at an antinode will affect the field rather more\nstrongly.4 In such a picture, the atom is constantly being pumped into a dressed-state\nfrom which it preferentially decays in such a way as to lose kinetic energy. We note\nthat a very similar mechanism is in operation here as in traditional Sisyphus cooling\nbut-crucially-the delay process has been shifted from an internal delay mechanism\n(optical pumping between the different magnetic sublevels of the atom) to an external\none (optical pumping between the atom\u2013cavity dressed states), since the response of the\ncavity field is necessarily a viscous one.\nTo illustrate the generality of this idea, let us consider the potential energy U [x, xa (t), v]\nat time t on a test particle at position x due to an atom following a path xa (t) = x0 + vt.\nWe suppose that the dependence of U on the motion of the atom is mediated entirely\nthrough the action of a 'memory' in the system, or another time-delayed effect, that can\n3\n\nWith sincere apologies to J. Dalibard and C. Cohen-Tannoudji.\n\n4\n\nA similar point, with implications for photonic crystals, is made about atoms in an optical lattice in\nRef.

Eq. (2.15) may not be\ntrivial to evaluate in practice, and in other circumstances the model itself may not apply;\nfor a given situation \u03c4 may be ill-defined, for example. Nevertheless, it allows us to make\na general and powerful prediction that applies to a wide range of systems: by simply\nendowing a system with a memory, the dipole force can be used to cool the motion of the\nparticle interacting with the system. It also provides a physical link between models that\nuse an external memory, such as a cavity field, and those that use an internal memory,\nsuch as populations in different hyperfine levels.\n\n2.5\n\nCavity fields and atomic motion: A brief review of current work\n\nThe first few sections of this chapter discussed various ways of capturing atoms or slowing\ntheir motion down. In the sections following this, we will explore novel methods that\nuse an optical memory, cf. Section 2.4, to achieve cooling. At this stage, therefore, it\nwould be good to briefly summarise the existing work that uses cavities to slow atoms\ndown or otherwise control their motion. Our later work will borrow heavily from the\nideas presented here.\n\n2.5.1\n\nCavity-mediated cooling\n\nThe electromagnetic field inside a cavity differs from that in free space in several respects.\nOn the most basic level, the zeroth-order approximation of a (resonant) cavity field is\na region in physical space where the electromagnetic field is, for a given driving power,\nstronger than in other locations. Such a coarse approximation, however, has limited\napplicability.6 A first-order approximation to a cavity field would include memory effects\nwhich, as we have seen above, imply that the cavity field can be used to control atomic\n6\n\nThis point is, of course, arguable: the strong coupling of atoms to the electromagnetic field is an\ninteresting field of research with several applications [76].\n\n\fTrapping and cooling atoms\n\n41\n\nmotion. Quantum mechanically, however, the field inside a good cavity is modified\nin a highly nontrivial way, for even the vacuum fluctuations themselves are modified.\nThis phenomenon is the origin of the Purcell effect [77] and was recognised in the early\n1990's as a way of inducing cooling forces on atoms [22]. The theory of cavity-mediated\ncooling of atoms subsequently developed in the direction of driven high-Q cavities [78].\nRef. [19] was the first to point out evidence for a novel cooling process taking place inside\nsuch cavities that is reminiscent of Sisyphus\u2013type sub-Doppler cooling mechanisms (cf.\nRef. [14], but see also above): the basis of the mechanism here being that the photon\nnumber in a cavity is, in the strong coupling regime, intimately connected with the\nposition of the atom inside the cavity. By choosing the right system parameters, this\nconnection can be used to slow down the atomic motion. Cavity-mediated cooling of\natoms was observed only in recent experiments [20, 21]. The potential application of this\nmechanism to the cooling of the motion of dielectric particles has also been noted [79, 80]\nand progress is rapidly being made towards the experimental realisation of cavity cooling\nof microscopic dielectric 'particles', both in the form of microspheres [79] and in the form\nof micromirrors [81, 82], with profound implications for the study of the foundations of\nquantum mechanics and even relativity [18].\nOur work in later sections, in particular Section 4.1, will explore the use of cavities in\na different way. By placing a particle outside a cavity, we can still benefit from the\npresence of the cavity in lengthening the time delay, but without subjecting the particle\nto the strong field present inside a resonant cavity.\n\n2.5.2\n\nRing cavity cooling\n\nInvestigations of cavity cooling inside Fabry\u2013P\u00e9rot cavities have focussed on the 'goodcavity' limit, where the bare cavity has a very high finesse or Q-factor. Ring cavities, by\ntheir very topology, tend to be larger and with a lower Q-factor. This has, perhaps, been\none reason why cooling of atoms inside ring cavities has not been explored as thoroughly\nas cavity-mediated cooling. One distinct advantage of ring cavities is that the system\nis translationally invariant with respect to the position of the atom; any friction forces\ndeveloped on the atom are subsequently not dependent on the position of the atom (this\nwill be seen to be a serious limitation of cavity-mediated cooling in Section 4.2.2.1). The\ntheory for cooling atoms inside ring cavities [83\u201388] is similar to that for cavity-mediated\n\n\fTrapping and cooling atoms\n\n42\n\ncooling. Experimental work on atoms inside ring cavities is rather sparse and tends to\nfocus on recoil-induced effects [89, 90], which will be discussed next. It has also been\nproposed (see Refs. [91] and [92]; see also Section 4.3) that the practical limitation of\nring cavities as low-Q devices can be lifted by the use of a gain medium inside the ring\ncavity. This approach holds promise towards improving the performance of such cavity\nsystems to the point that they may be useful in practical realisations of optomechanics\nexperiments.\n\n2.5.3\n\nSelf-organisation of atoms inside cavities\n\nThe strong feedback between atoms and cavity fields may, under the right conditions,\nresult in self-organisation of an atomic ensemble inside a cavity. We mention here\ntwo distinct effects. In Fabry\u2013P\u00e9rot cavities, it was proposed [93] and subsequently\nobserved [94] that above a threshold pump power, an ensemble of atoms will organise\ninto a checkerboard pattern. Two possible configurations are possible, with the atoms\noccupying either set of sites in the checkerboard, and transitions occur between the two\ndue to the presence of noise in the system.\nCollective atomic recoil lasing (CARL) [89, 90, 95, 96] is a related phenomenon that\noccurs inside ring cavities. CARL occurs when a pump beam inside a ring cavity is\nreflected off an ensemble of atoms into the counterpropagating mode. The motion of\nthe atoms will Doppler-shift this reflection. An exponential build-up of this latter mode\ncan then occur, accompanied by a spontaneous self-organisation of the ensemble into\na grating-like structure. In such a setup, the atomic ensemble acts as a gain medium\nfor the counterpropagating wave, and in its reliance on a gain medium CARL is related\nto the 'amplified optomechanics' idea we discuss in Section 4.3. However, amplified\noptomechanics uses a gain medium that is spatially separated from the atomic ensemble,\nin a similar way to the ideas discussed in Ref. [91], whereas in CARL the two are one\nand the same.\n\n2.6\n\nMirror-mediated cooling\n\nAs explained Section 2.4, the dipole force can be invested with a dissipative character\nby endowing the system as a whole with a memory. Exploring the cooling of atoms\n\n\f43\n\nTrapping and cooling atoms\n\n(a) Cavity-Mediated Cooling\n\n(b) Mirror-Mediated Cooling\n\nFigure 2.2: Space\u2013time diagrams showing the interaction of an atom with light when\nthe atom is (a) inside an optical resonator, and (b) in front of a mirror. It is clear that\nin case (a) one gets multiple interactions between the two and a 'memory time' is not\nwell-defined, whereas in case (b) a definite memory time can be assigned. The blank\narrow indicates the pump beam.\n\ninside cavities using this terminology is fine in principle, since a cavity may be viewed\nas the archetypal optical memory element, but is not easy in practice. Indeed, in such a\nsystem, a well-defined \"delay time\" does not exist: a cavity has several memories, each\none arising from a separate interaction of the same light with the atom. By simplifying\nthe system and removing one of the cavity mirrors, we can once again talk about such\na concept as a delay time \u03c4 . In this configuration, light interacts with the atom twice,\nat times t = 0 and t = \u03c4 , say, and no more.7 These two pictures are illustrated\nschematically in Fig. 2.2. Whereas we can readily define the system memory time\n\u03c4 = t2 \u2212 t1\n\n(2.16)\n\nfor Fig. 2.2(b), no such intuitive definition is possible in Fig. 2.2(a) because (i) if the\natom is not at the centre of the cavity, then t2 \u2212 t1 6= t3 \u2212 t2 6= . . . , and (ii) each\ninteraction has a different weighting due to the imperfect reflectivity of the mirrors; it is\nhowever possible to assign an effective memory time \u03c4 = 1/(2\u03ba), where \u03ba is the HWHM\nlinewidth of the cavity. Indeed, it will be shown in Appendix 3.A.3 that the finesse of a\ncavity can be written as\nF = \u03c0N ,\n7\n\n(2.17)\n\nThis is a very 'classical' picture, where we describe the light by means of point-like photons. This\ndescription is used here to illustrate the physics of the situation. Quantitative calculations can only\nbe made by properly describing the light in terms of the solutions to Maxwell's equations.\n\n\f44\n\nTrapping and cooling atoms\n\nwhere N is the number of round-trips made by the light inside the cavity before the\nintracavity intensity decays by a factor 1/e2 . The dipole energy U is proportional to the\ndelayed electric field; so one would expect that the effect of the cavity field on U decays\nby a factor 1/e over N round-trips. It seems reasonable, therefore, to set\nM (T ) = 1 \u2212 e\u22121/N\n\n\u0001 X\n\nn even\n\n\u03b4 T \u2212 nL1 /c)e\u2212n/N + 1 \u2212 e\u22121/N\n\n\u0001 X\n\nn odd\n\n\u03b4 T \u2212 nL2 /c)e\u2212n/N ,\n(2.18)\n\nwith L1 and L2 being the distances from the atom to the two cavity mirrors and L =\nL1 +L2 the cavity length. This memory function represents an infinite number of discrete\ninteractions, each one being weaker than the previous, of the cavity field with the atom.\nThus, in the good-cavity limit of large N ,\n\u03c4=\n\nL1 + L2\n1\nFL\nLN\n=\n.\n\u2192\nc\nc\n\u03c0c\ne1/N \u2212 1\n\n(2.19)\n\nIt will also be shown (see Appendix 3.A.3) that \u03ba = \u03c0c/(2FL). It thus follows that\n\u03c4 = 1/(2\u03ba) is a good definition for the effective memory time of the system in this\nmodel. Throughout the rest of this chapter and in later chapters, we shall see how this\nmemory time \u03c4 governs the interaction of the particle with the field.\nThe remainder of this section will be devoted to the mathematical description of mirrormediated cooling and follows closely Ref. [41]. It was published as Xuereb, A., Horak,\nP. & Freegarde, T. Phys. Rev. A 80, 013836 (2009) and several parts are reproduced\nverbatim. This paper was the first to introduce the 'mirror-mediated cooling' mechanism,\nbut was accompanied by another paper [97] that discusses the more computationallyoriented aspects of the Monte\u2013Carlo simulations performed.\nA semiclassical model of the situation is presented in Section 2.6.1. The model is then\nexplored analytically in a perturbative manner (Section 2.6.2), and numerically using\nMonte\u2013Carlo simulations (Section 2.6.3). Finally, a few brief comments are made about\nsome of the approximations made to describe the system.\n\n2.6.1\n\nMathematical model\n\nWe shall use the TLA model explored in detail in Chapter 1. The atom will be assumed\nto have a transition frequency \u03c90 and upper-state decay rate 2\u0393, as before, and be\ncoupled to a continuum of quantised electromagnetic modes with frequencies \u03c9 and\n\n\f45\n\nTrapping and cooling atoms\nstanding-wave mode functions\nf (\u03c9, x) = sin(\u03c9x/c) ,\n\n(2.20)\n\nwith the mirror being at x = 0. The field modes have annihilation and creation operators \u00e2(\u03c9) and \u00e2\u2020 (\u03c9), respectively, and the atom\u2013field coupling is described by a single,\nfrequency-independent, coupling coefficient g. The mode at frequency \u03c9 = \u03c9L is pumped\nin a coherent field by a laser, and we assume that the detuning, defined as\n\u2206L = \u03c9L \u2212 \u03c90 ,\n\n(2.21)\n\nobeys the condition |\u2206L | \u001d \u0393; i.e., we assume far off-resonant operation. The numerical\nexamples we give will be for a\n\n85 Rb\n\natom cycling in the 5S1/2 \u2194 5P3/2 transition.\n\nThe starting point for our description is the quantum master equation, Eq. (1.17), where\nthe Hamiltonian now reads\np\u03022\n\u2212~\u2206\u03c3\u0302 + \u03c3\u0302 \u2212 +\n\u0124 =\n2m\n\nZ\n\nZ\n~(\u03c9 \u2212\u03c9L )\u00e2 (\u03c9)\u00e2(\u03c9) d\u03c9 \u2212i~g [\u03c3\u0302 + \u00e2(\u03c9)f (\u03c9, x\u0302)\u2212H.c] d\u03c9 , (2.22)\n\u2020\n\nwhere x\u0302 and p\u0302 are the position and momentum operators of the atom and 'H.c.' denotes\nthe Hermitian conjugate. We also use the Liouvillian terms\n\u0014\nZ\nL\u03c1\u0302 = \u2212\u0393 \u03c3\u0302 + \u03c3\u0302 \u2212 \u03c1\u0302 + \u03c1\u0302\u03c3\u0302 + \u03c3\u0302 \u2212 \u2212 2\n\n1\n\n\u22121\n\n\u0015\nN (u)\u03c3\u0302 \u2212 e\u2212iux\u0302 \u03c1\u0302eiux\u0302 \u03c3\u0302 + du .\n\n(2.23)\n\nIn this expression, N (u) describes the 1D projection of the spontaneous emission pattern\nof the atomic dipole. In the low-saturation regime, we can adiabatically eliminate the\ninternal atomic dynamics and formally express the dipole operator as\ni\u2206 + \u0393\ng\n\u03c3\u0302 = \u2212 2\n\u2206 + \u03932\n\u2212\n\nwhere \u03be\u02c6\u2212 is a noise term [43].\n\nZ\n\nf (\u03c9, x\u0302)\u00e2(\u03c9) d\u03c9 + \u03be\u02c6\u2212 ,\n\n(2.24)\n\n\f46\n\nTrapping and cooling atoms\n\n2.6.2\n\nA perturbative approach to exploring the model\n\n2.6.2.1\n\nForce on a static atom\n\nThe aim of this section is to derive an analytical expression for the friction force acting\non the atom when the latter is not moving. To achieve this, we treat the atomic position\nclassically, effecting the replacement x\u0302 \u2192 x0 in Eq. (2.22) to obtain\n\u0124 =\n\nZ\n\n~(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9L )\u00e2\u2020 (\u03c9)\u00e2(\u03c9) d\u03c9\nZZ\ng 2 \u2206L\n+~ 2\nsin(\u03c91 x0 /c) sin(\u03c92 x0 /c)\u00e2\u2020 (\u03c91 )\u00e2(\u03c92 ) d\u03c91 d\u03c92 . (2.25)\n\u2206L + \u0393 2\n\nA consequence of assuming |\u2206L | \u001d \u0393, and operating in the low-saturation regime, is\nthat the population of the excited state is negligible, and therefore last term in Eq. (2.23)\ndoes not contribute to the dynamics. With this simplification, the master equation for\nthe annihilation operators reduces to\n\u0003\ni\u0002\nd\n\u00e2(\u03c9, t) = \u0124, \u00e2(\u03c9, t) .\ndt\n~\n\n(2.26)\n\nBy substituting Eq. (2.22) into this equation, we obtain the integro-differential equation\nd\ng 2 \u2206L\n\u00e2(\u03c9, t) = \u2212i(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9L )\u00e2(\u03c9, t) \u2212 i 2\nsin(\u03c9x0 /c)\ndt\n\u2206L + \u0393 2\n\nZ\n\nsin(\u03c91 x0 /c)\u00e2(\u03c91 , t) d\u03c91 . (2.27)\n\nWe now assume coherent states at all times for the fields and replace the operators\nwith their respective expectation values. Since we are pumping the atom at a single\nfrequency, we take the initial condition a(\u03c9, 0) = A \u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9L ), where A is the amplitude\n\nof the pump field, such that |A|2 is the pump power in units of photons per second, and\n\u03b4 is the Dirac \u03b4-function. We now expand the fields a(\u03c9, t) in the weak-coupling limit\nin powers of the coupling constant,\na(\u03c9, t) =\n\nX\nn\n\n\u0012 2\n\u0013n\ng \u2206L\nan (\u03c9, t)\n,\n\u22062L + \u03932\n\n(2.28)\n\nwith an (\u03c9, t) being the nth coefficient of the series expansion. Solving Eq. (2.27) to\n\u0001\nsuccessive orders in g 2 \u2206L / \u22062L + \u03932 yields the zeroth order term in this parameter,\na0 (\u03c9, t) = A\u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9L ) ,\n\n(2.29)\n\n\f47\n\nTrapping and cooling atoms\nand the first order term\na1 (\u03c9, t) = A\n\nexp [\u2212i(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9L )t] \u2212 1\nsin(\u03c9x0 /c) sin(\u03c9L x0 /c) .\n\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9L\n\n(2.30)\n\nTo the same level of approximation, we can now find the force acting on the atom to\n\u0001\nsecond order in g 2 \u2206L / \u22062L + \u03932 .8 The (classical) force acting on the atom is, then,\nF(x0 ) = \u2212\n\n\u2202H\n, or\n\u2202x\n\n(2.31)\n\n\u001a\n2\n~\n2 g \u2206L\n\u03c9L sin(2\u03c9L x0 /c)\nF(x0 ) = |A|\nc\n\u22062L + \u03932\n\n\u001b\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03c0 g 2 \u2206L\n2\n2\n\u2212\nsin (\u03c9L x0 /c) 4 cos (\u03c9L x0 /c) \u2212 1 . (2.32)\n2 \u22062L + \u03932\n\nThe two terms making up this force have different origins. The first term represents the\ninteraction between the dipole induced in the atom and the (unperturbed) pump field.\nThe second term is the lowest-order correction to the force when the back-action of the\natom on the light field is taken into account. The latter term therefore represents the\ninteraction between the dipole induced in the atom by the pump field and the electric\nfield propagated from this same dipole. What we shall see, in the next subsection, is\nthat this propagated electric field can, after being reflected by the mirror, re-interact\nwith the atomic dipole. The motion of the atom between these two interactions gives\nrise to a velocity-dependent force, i.e., a friction force, on the atom.\n\n2.6.2.2\n\nForce on a moving atom: Friction forces\n\nLet us now assume that the atom is moving at a constant velocity, v. x\u0302 is now a function\nof time, such that x\u0302 \u2192 x(t) = x0 + vt, assuming that by t = 0 the system has already\nreached steady-state; in other words, the pump beam has been on for a time longer than\n\u03c4 = 2x0 /c, which is the time taken for a disturbance to travel from the position of the\natom to the mirror and back again. With this replacement for x\u0302, we proceed to solve\n\u0001\nEq. (2.27), keeping terms up to first order in g 2 \u2206L / \u22062L + \u03932 , as before. The friction\n8\n\nMathematically, the fact that the force is at a higher order arises from \u0124 not having any zeroth order\nterms [see Eq. (2.22)]; physically, the force is an interaction of an electric field with an induced dipole\nmoment, and the electric field in this case is itself caused by the induced dipole at an earlier time.\n\u0001\nBoth the induced dipole and this electric field are then, to lowest order, linear in g 2 \u2206L / \u22062L + \u03932 .\nThis term in the force is therefore quadratic in the same parameter.\n\n\f48\n\nTrapping and cooling atoms\nforce (in the longitudinal direction, i.e., along x) can finally be obtained:\n\n\u0012 2\n\u00132\n\u0012 2\n\u00132\ng \u2206L\ng \u2206L\nv 2\n2\n2\n2\nFk (x0 ) = 2\u03c0~kL |A|\nsin (2kL x0 ) \u2212 \u03c0~kL v\u03c4 |A|\nsin(4kL x0 ) ,\nc\n\u22062L + \u03932\n\u22062L + \u03932\n(2.33)\nwith kL = \u03c9L /c being the wavenumber of the pump field; this force lacks the usual\n'optical molasses' friction force that is produced by the interaction between the atomic\ndipole and the Doppler-shifted, unperturbed, pump beam because the atomic excited\nstate has been adiabatically eliminated. The first term in the friction force expression is\nthe velocity-dependent analogue of the second term in F(x0 ) above: it represents the interaction between the induced dipole of the atom and the instantaneous Doppler-shifted\nfield produced by that same dipole. It is the second, 'delayed', term, however, that we\nwill be concerned with in the following. Indeed, this term represents the interaction\nbetween the atomic dipole and the reflected field it itself produces; the Doppler shift\nhere can effectively be looked at as changing the phase accrued by the reflected field in\narriving back at the atom.\nThe delayed friction force is larger than the instantaneous friction force by a factor kL x0 ,\nand we are therefore fully justified in setting\nFk (x0 ) =\n\n\u2212\u03c0~kL2 v\u03c4 |A|2\n\n\u0012\n\ng 2 \u2206L\n\u22062L + \u03932\n\n\u00132\n\nsin(4kL x0 )\n\n(2.34)\n\nif we constrain ourselves to the far-field limit, kL x0 \u226b 1.\nSupposing that the species we are cooling is\n\n85 Rb,\n\nand setting |A|2 = 62.5\u0393/(2\u03c0), \u2206L =\n\n\u221210\u0393, \u03c4 = 0.5/\u0393, and Gaussian beam waist w = 1.4 \u03bcm, Eq. (2.34) predicts 1/e cooling\ntimes of the order of 2 ms. The value for \u03c4 that we use implies a separation between the\natom and the mirror of the order of several metres. We suggest that this problem can\nbe overcome through the coupling of the light into an optical fibre, thereby avoiding the\neffects of diffraction. A recent experiment making use of a similar technique is described\nin Ref. [98].\nEq. (2.34) indicates an exponential decay or increase in velocity. We define the cooling\ncoefficient as % = \u2212F/v, whereby we obtain the relation dp2 /dt = \u22122%p2 , which thus\ndepends on position as sin(4kL x0 ). Moreover, since p2 \u221d T for a thermal ensemble, we\nalso have dT /dt = \u22122%T . Fig. 2.3 shows a plot of % against atomic position, where we\n\nintroduced the coordinate x00 relative to the nearest node of the standing wave pump.

This force arises\nfrom the spatial variation of the coupling constant g when the pump field is assumed\nto be a tightly-focussed Gaussian beam. In this case the coupling constant g becomes\na function g(r), where r is the coordinate in the transverse direction. For an atom\nmoving at small constant velocity, we may write g(r0 + vt) \u2248 g(r0 ) + vtg 0 (r0 ), where\ng 0 (r) = dg/dr and time t = 0, at which r = r0 , is defined as before. Substituting this\ninto Eq. (2.27) we can derive an expression for the friction force, F\u22a5 (x0 ) = \u2212\u2202H/\u2202r, in\nthe direction of r:\nF\u22a5 (x0 ) = \u22122\u03c0~v\u03c4 |A|2\n\n\u0012\n\n2gg 0 \u2206L\n\u22062L + \u03932\n\n\u00132\n\nsin3 (kL x0 ) cos(kL x0 ) ,\n\n(2.35)\n\nwith g and g 0 being evaluated at r = r0 . This transverse friction force is also shown\nin Fig. 2.3, for comparison with the longitudinal friction force, assuming a Gaussian\nmode function of waist w = 1.4 \u03bcm. Note that Fk and F\u22a5 are comparable in magnitude\nfor the parameters chosen here, i.e., where the mode waist is comparable to the optical\nwavelength. Moreover, we can see that there exist regions where both these forces\n\n\f50\n\nTrapping and cooling atoms\n\npromote cooling. In the remainder of this section, however, we will concentrate on a\none-dimensional treatment of the problem and therefore only consider the longitudinal\nfriction force.\nIn terms of more familiar parameters, we can rewrite Eq. (2.34) in the limit |\u2206L | \u001d \u0393\nas\nFk (x0 ) = \u2212vs\u0393\n\n\u03c3a 2\n~k \u03c4 sin(4kL x0 ) ,\n\u03c3L L\n\n(2.36)\n\nwhere s = g 2 |A|2 /(\u22062L + \u03932 ) is the maximum saturation parameter of the atom in the\nstanding wave, \u03c3a = 3\u03bb2L /(2\u03c0) is the atomic radiative cross-section at a wavelength \u03bbL =\n2\u03c0/kL , as defined in Section 1.4, and where we used the relation 2\u03c0g 2 /\u0393 = 4\u03c3a /(2\u03c3L ),\nwith \u03c3L = \u03c0w2 /8 being the mode area of the pump beam of waist w, and where the\nfactor of 4 arises from the standing wave amplitude.\nAside from allowing us to make predictions of cooling times, Eqs. (2.34) and (2.36) also\nhighlight the dependence of this cooling effect on the variation of important physical\nparameters. In particular, Fk depends on the square of the detuning, which means that\nit is possible to obtain cooling with both positive and negative detuning, in stark contrast\nwith the standard Doppler cooling force. The friction force also scales with w\u22124 and\n|A|2 . Hence, for a fixed laser intensity, proportional to |A|2 /w2 , i.e., for a fixed atomic\n\nsaturation, the friction still scales with w\u22122 and thus a tight focus is needed in order\nto have a sizeable effect. The physical reason for this dependence is that the dipole\nmoment induced in the atom by the pump light is proportional to |A|2 g 2 \u221d |A|2 /w2 ;\nthis polarisation couples to the electric field and, after being reflected by the mirror,\npolarises the atom again. The size of the force therefore scales as |A|2 g 4 , or |A|2 /w4 .\nA very promising feature of these two equations is the linear dependence of the cooling\nrate on \u03c4 : by increasing the distance between the atom and the mirror, we can increase\nthe strength of the friction force acting on the atom. In Section 2.6.3 we further analyze\nthe dependence of the cooling rate on the various parameters and support the validity\nof the analytical solution by comparing it with the results of simulations.\n\n2.6.2.3\n\nLocalising the atom: The effects of adding a harmonic trap\n\nEq. (2.34) shows that, in order to observe any cooling effects, we need to localise the\nparticle within around \u03bbL /8. This may be achieved, for example, by an additional\n\n\f51\n\nTrapping and cooling atoms\n\nfar off-resonant and tightly focussed laser beam propagating parallel to the mirror and\nforming a dipole trap centred at a point x0 . In this section, we aim to characterise the\neffects of this dipole trap, or indeed any harmonic trap, on the atom\u2013field interaction.\nWe characterise this trap by means of its spring constant kt , such that the trapping\nforce is given by Ft = \u2212kt (x \u2212 x0 ), or equivalently by the harmonic oscillator frequency\np\n\u03c9t = kt /m, where m is the mass of the atom.\n\nWith the atom being in a harmonic trap, we can now write down its time-dependent\n\nvelocity as v(t) = vm cos(\u03c9t t), with a maximum velocity of the atom vm . Using this\nexpression, it is possible to derive a modified cooling coefficient by performing a perturbative expansion in the dimensionless parameter vm /c. Proceeding along the lines of\nthe preceding section, we arrive at a modified expression for the friction force,\nFk (x0 ) =\n\n\u2212\u03c0~kL2 vm \u03c4\n\n2\n\nsinc(\u03c9t \u03c4 )|A|\n\n\u0012\n\ng2\u2206\n\u22062 + \u0393 2\n\n\u00132\n\nsin(4kL x0 ) .\n\n(2.37)\n\nBy way of confirmation, it is easy to see that this expression reduces to Eq. (2.34) in\nthe limit of small \u03c9t ; i.e., in the free-particle limit for the atomic motion. The sinusoidal\ndependence on \u03c9t \u03c4 can be justified in an intuitive manner: the effect on the particle is\nunchanged if the particle undergoes an integer number of oscillations in the round-trip\ntime \u03c4 .\nWhile Eq. (2.37) was derived for an oscillating atom, it only accounts for the sinusoidal\nvariation of the velocity, and therefore does not include the effect of the finite spatial\ndistribution of the position of the atom. In order to obtain an estimate for the friction\nforce in the presence of this spatial broadening, we calculate the overall energy loss rate\nexperienced by the particle in terms of the time average of Eq. (2.34):\n\u001c\n\ndp2\ndt\n\n\u001d\n\n= \u2212\n\n\u0012\n\u00132 Z 2\u03c0\n\u0002\n\u0003\n~kL2 p20\ng2\u2206\n\u03c4 |A|2\nsin 4kL x0 + 4kL xm sin(T ) cos2 (T ) dT ,\n2\n2\nm\n\u2206 +\u0393\n0\n\n(2.38)\n\nwhere p0 = mvm is the maximum momentum of the particle in the trap, given by\n\u221a\np0 = xm mkt . The value of the integral in Eq. (2.38) can be expressed as\n\u0003\n2\u03c0 \u0002\nsin(4kL x0 )J1 (4kL xm ) + cos(4kL x0 )H1 (4kL xm ) ,\n4kL xm\n\n(2.39)\n\n\f52\n\nTrapping and cooling atoms\n6\n\ndp2 /dt (\u0393 ~2 k 2 )\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\nCapture range\n\nz\n\n}|\n\n{\n\n-2\n\n-4\n\n-6\n0\n\n0.25\n\n0.50\n\n0.75\n\n1.00\n2\n\n1.25\n\n1.50 \u00d7 106\n\n2 2\n\n(Initial momentum, p0 ) (~ k )\n\nFigure 2.4: Dependence of dp2 /dt on the square of the initial momentum, p20 , for\n\u03c9t = 0.45 \u00d7 2\u03c0\u0393 and x00 = 3\u03bbL /16. Other parameters are as in Fig. 2.3. Cooling is\nachieved only for a finite range of initial momenta.\n\nwhere J1 is the order-1 Bessel function of the first kind and H1 is the order-1 Struve\nfunction [99]. At the point of maximum friction, which occurs at x0 = \u22123\u03bbL /16 + n\u03bbL\nfor some integer n, the integral in the above equation reduces to 2\u03c0J1 (4kL xm )/(4kL xm );\nthis function can be readily evaluated numerically for a given trap frequency.\nFor small values of the trap frequency, the effect of the above averaging process is to\nintroduce a factor of\n\n1\n2\n\ninto Eq. (2.37). The result can be seen as being physically\n\nequivalent to the effect of cooling only one degree of freedom when the atom is in a\nharmonic trap. Finally, we combine the above two ideas to include both the effects\nof harmonic oscillation and the spatial extent of the atomic motion into Eq. (2.38).\nThis can be done, effectively, by replacing \u03c4 \u2192 sin(\u03c9t \u03c4 )/\u03c9t . The resulting approximate\nexpression for the friction force, taking into account the periodicity in the time delay as\nwell as spatial averaging effects, becomes\n\nFk (x0 ) =\n\n\u2212 21 ~kL2 vm \u03c4 |A|2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u00132\ng2\u2206\nsinc(\u03c9t \u03c4 )\n\u22062 + \u0393 2\nZ 2\u03c0\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u00d7\nsin 4kL x0 + 4kL xm sin(T ) cos2 (T ) dT .

In fact, it increases from zero, for increasing p0 , achieves a maximum,\nand then decreases again until it reaches zero at some value for p0 . Physically, this is\ndue to the broader spatial distribution for faster particles in the harmonic trap. For fast\nenough velocities, the particle oscillates into the heating regions, as can be deduced from\nFig. 2.3, even if the trap is centred at the position of maximum cooling. This defines a\nrange of initial momenta, starting from zero, within which a particle is cooled by this\nmechanism; faster particles are heated and ejected from the trap. Note that this result\nwas derived from the friction to lowest order in velocity v, and higher-order terms are\nexpected to affect the capture range for high values of p0 .\nAt particular values of x00 , e.g. at \u22123\u03bbL /16, this capture range can be conveniently estimated by using the location of the first zero of the Bessel function, giving a momentum\ncapture range\npm \u2248 0.958\n\np\nmkt /kL = 0.958m\u03c9t /kL .\n\n(2.41)\n\nThus, p2m \u221d \u03c9t2 , for values of \u03c9t that are not too large, and the capture range as defined\nin Fig. 2.4 is expected to scale with the square of the trap frequency. We will compare\nthis later, in Section 2.6.3, with the results of Monte\u2013Carlo numerical simulations.\n\n\f54\n\nTrapping and cooling atoms\n2.6.2.5\n\nDiffusion and steady-state temperature\n\nThe main result of the preceding discussion was a friction force, which of course cools an\natom towards zero momentum in the absence of any other effects. Momentum diffusion\ndue to spontaneous scattering, in a manner similar to that discussed in Section 1.7,\nintroduces a constant in the equation for dp2 /dt and results in a constant upward shift\nof the curve in Fig. 2.4. This slightly reduces the capture range for fast particles, but its\nmain effect is to introduce a specific value of the momentum where friction and diffusion\nexactly compensate each other in the small p0 range. This point corresponds to the\nsteady-state temperature achievable through the cooling mechanism discussed here.\nTo lowest order in the coupling frequency g 2 , the momentum diffusion is given by the\ninteraction of the atom with the unperturbed, standing-wave pump field. In this limit,\ndiffusion in our system is therefore identical to that encountered in the usual Doppler\ncooling mechanism [51, 52, 100, 101], where the diffusion coefficient D is given to lowest\norder in s by\n\nh\ni\nD = ~2 kL2 \u0393s cos2 (kL x0 ) + 52 sin2 (kL x0 ) .\n\n(2.42)\n\nThe steady-state temperature TM of mirror-mediated cooling is then obtained from\nEq. (1.61) using % = \u2212Fk (x0 )/vm , with Fk (x0 ) given by Eq. (2.37). For |\u2206L | \u001d \u0393\nwe thus find\nTM =\n\n1 ~ \u03c9t \u0393 2 + 3 cos2 (kL x0 )\n.\n5\u03c0 kB g 2 sin(\u03c9t \u03c4 ) sin(4kL x0 )\n\n(2.43)\n\nAn example of the dependence of TM on the trap position is shown in Fig. 2.5, predicting a minimum temperature of the order of 400 \u03bcK. Whilst this may seem large in\ncomparison to the Doppler temperature of 141 \u03bcK, one has to keep in mind that TM ,\ngiven by Eq. (2.43), is insensitive to detuning and, for far off-resonant operation of the\norder of tens of linewidths, it will be the dominant mechanism. This is further discussed\nin Section 2.6.4. We also note that Fig. 2.5 further highlights the importance of the\nrequirement for localising the particle.\nUsing Eq. (2.36) we can approximate the steady-state temperature at the point of maximum friction by\nTM \u2248\n\n~ \u03c3L\n.\n2kB \u03c4 \u03c3a\n\n(2.44)\n\nIt is interesting to note that this expression is closely related to the expression for the\nlimiting temperature in Doppler cooling, kB T = ~\u0393, but where the upper state lifetime\n\n\f55\n\nTrapping and cooling atoms\n\n1/(2\u0393) is replaced by the atom\u2013mirror delay time, \u03c4 , and where a geometrical factor\nequal to the mode area divided by the atomic radiative cross-section is included.\nThis last point will turn out to be a general trend in the cooling methods we discuss.\nThe steady-state temperature is in general described by a function of the form\nT =\n\n~\n\u03c6,\n2kB \u03c4\u0303\n\n(2.45)\n\nwhere \u03c4\u0303 is the characteristic time-e.g., the memory time-of the system and \u03c6 depends\non the geometry of the situation. In Doppler cooling, the characteristic time is the\nlifetime of the upper state, \u03c4\u0303 = 1/(2\u0393), whereas in mirror-mediated cooling it is naturally\nthe delay time \u03c4 . In cavity-mediated cooling, where the atom is inside a cavity, the\nenergy loss mechanism is due to the decay of the cavity field, and we thereby have\n\u03c4\u0303 = 1/(2\u03ba) [19], where \u03ba is the linewidth of the cavity field.\n\n2.6.3\n\nNumerical analysis of mirror-mediated cooling\n\nIn this section we now investigate a more accurate numerical model to corroborate the\nsimplified analytical results obtained above.9 In order to render the problem numerically\ntractable, the continuum of modes is replaced by a discrete set of modes with frequencies\n\u03c9k , with k = 1, . . . , N . The master equation Eq. (1.17) is then converted by use of the\nWigner transform [37] into a Fokker\u2013Planck equation for the atomic and field variables.\nApplying a semiclassical approximation and restricting the equation of motion to secondorder derivatives, one arrives at an equivalent set of stochastic differential equations for\na single atom with momentum p and position x in a discrete multimode field with mode\namplitudes \u03b1k [102],\np\ndt ,\n(2.46a)\nm\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0003\nd \u2217\nd\nd \u2217\nd\ndp = i\u03b30 E(x) dx\nE (x) \u2212 E \u2217 (x) dx\nE(x) dt \u2212 U0 E(x) dx\nE (x) + E \u2217 (x) dx\nE(x) dt\n\ndx =\n\n\u2212 kt (x \u2212 xt )dt + dP , and\n\nd\u03b1k = i\u2206k \u03b1k dt \u2212 (iU0 + \u03b30 )E(x)fk\u2217 (x)dt + dAk ,\n9\n\n(2.46b)\n(2.46c)\n\nThe Fokker\u2013Planck equation was obtained, through the use of a suitably extended Wigner transform,\nby Peter Horak. The basis for the Monte\u2013Carlo code was also written by PH, and then extended by\nAX. The simulations and data analysis were performed by AX.\n\n\f56\n\nTrapping and cooling atoms\nwhere fk (x) = sin(\u03c9k x/c) are the individual mode functions, E(x) =\n\nP\n\nk\n\n\u03b1k fk (x) is the\n\ntotal electric field, \u2206k = \u03c9k \u2212 \u03c9L is the detuning of each mode from the pump, U0 is the\nlight shift per photon, and \u03b30 is the photon scattering rate. The terms dP and dAk are\ncorrelated noise terms [102] responsible for momentum and field diffusion.\nIn the following, we set the trap centre to xt = \u22123\u03bbL /16, modulo \u03bbL , which is the\npoint where the analytical solution predicts the maximum of the damping force. We use\nN = 256 field modes with a mode spacing of \u0393/10. At the start of every simulation, all\nfield modes are empty with the exception of the pump mode which is initialised at 625\nphotons, corresponding to a laser power of around 50 pW for our chosen parameters.\nThe simulations were performed in runs of several thousand trajectories. Each such run\nwas performed at a well-defined initial temperature, with the starting momenta of the\nparticles chosen from a Gaussian distribution, and the starting position being the centre\nof the trap.\n\n2.6.3.1\n\nFriction force and capture range\n\nFig. 2.6 presents the results of a set of simulations performed when setting the noise\nterms dP and dAk in equations Eq. (2.46) to zero, i.e., neglecting momentum and\nphoton number diffusion. The simulation data are compared with the result of the\nperturbative calculations Eq. (2.40). For modest values of \u03c9t , Fig. 2.6(a) justifies the\naveraging process used to derive Eq. (2.38), which was based on spatial averaging but\nneglecting higher order terms in v. In contrast, for larger trap frequencies, the numerical\nsimulations diverge significantly from the analytical result, as can be seen in Fig. 2.6(b).\nWe expect that the terms in higher powers of the initial speed, which were dropped in\nthe perturbative solution, are responsible for this discrepancy.\nWe have already seen, in Eq. (2.41), that the capture range is expected to scale as \u03c9t2 .\nFor weak traps, as shown in Fig. 2.7, the numerical simulations agree well with these\nexpectations. For stiffer traps, however, the capture range is consistently larger than\nthat predicted; in fact, the simulations predict a capture range of around 450 mK for a\ntrap frequency of 0.5 \u00d7 2\u03c0\u0393\n\n\f57\n\nTrapping and cooling atoms\n6\n\ndp2 /dt (\u0393 ~2 k 2 )\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n-4\n\n-6\n0\n\n0.25\n\n0.50\n\n0.75\n\n1.00\n\n1.25\n\n1.50\n\n(Initial momentum, p0 )2 (106 ~2 k 2 )\n(a) \u03c9t = 0.3 \u00d7 2\u03c0\u0393\n\ndp2 /dt (\u0393 ~2 k 2 )\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n-10\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\n4.00\n\n(Initial momentum, p0 )2 (106 ~2 k 2 )\n(b) \u03c9t = 0.5 \u00d7 2\u03c0\u0393\n\nFigure 2.6: Comparison of dp2 /dt for the simulations without noise (data points)\nwith the analytical approximation, Eq.

(2.46) including the diffusion terms. Because of the discrete nature of\nthe field modes with uniform frequency spacing used in the simulations, the numerically\nmodelled behaviour is always periodic in time with a periodicity given by the inverse\nof the frequency spacing. The simulations therefore cannot follow each trajectory to its\nsteady-state unless an unfeasibly large number of modes is used.

For each such group of trajectories the initial\nvalue of dT /dt was calculated. The results for \u03c9t = 0.5 \u00d7 2\u03c0\u0393 are shown in Fig. 2.8,\nwhere the error bars are due to statistical fluctuations for a finite number of stochastic\nintegrations. The steady-state temperature is that temperature at which dT /dt = 0 as\nclearly illustrated in this figure. For the chosen parameters, our data suggest a steadystate temperature of 722\u00b154 \u03bcK with a 1/e cooling time of around 3.0 ms.

(2.43) (solid line). The solid square represents the equivalent data from Fig. 2.8, resulting from a much larger number of simulations. Parameters\nare as in Fig. 2.6.\n\nWe finally performed a large number of simulations to investigate the dependence of\nthe steady-state temperature on the trap frequency. Eq. (2.43) indicates that as one\ndecreases \u03c9t the steady state temperature decreases. This is clearly seen in Fig. 2.9,\nwhich compares the prediction of Eq. (2.43) with a set of numerical simulations. The\ntrend in the data is reproduced well by the analytical expression. However, the simulated\nsteady-state temperature is consistently a little higher than predicted. We expect that\nthis discrepancy is due mainly to two reasons: (i) Eq. (2.43) was derived from the friction\nEq. (2.37), i.e., without the spatial averaging of Eq. (2.40) which would reduce the\nfriction force; and (ii) higher order terms in the velocity v are also expected to reduce\nfriction compared to the lowest order analytical result. For both these reasons, therefore,\nthe analytical expression is expected to overestimate the friction force and thus to predict\nequilibrium temperatures that are too low.\n\n2.6.4\n\nBeyond adiabatic theory\n\nAll the theoretical analysis and simulations discussed so far have been based on adiabatic\nelimination of the internal atomic degrees of freedom, and therefore neglected Doppler\ncooling.

In the presence of both cooling effects, and assuming that the momentum\ndiffusion terms are identical for both mechanisms, the stationary temperature achieved\nby the system is given by\nT =\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n1\n+\nTM TD\n\n\u0013\u22121\n\n.\n\n(2.48)\n\nThus, for the parameters of Fig. 2.9, the calculated steady-state temperature T reduces\nto 250 \u03bcK in the limit of vanishing \u03c9t .\nFrom Fig. 2.10 one can see that the mirror-mediated force, for our tightly focussed pump,\nis stronger than the Doppler force for detunings larger than around 10\u0393 in magnitude.\nIn practice this has two implications: for large negative detunings, we expect the steadystate temperature of the system to be significantly lower than that predicted by Doppler\ncooling; whereas for large positive detunings, we still predict equilibrium temperatures\nof the order of mK.\nBoth our perturbative expressions and our simulations are calculated to lowest orders in\nthe atomic saturation. However, it is well known that in the limit of very large detunings\nalso higher order terms in the saturation parameter s become significant. Using the full\n\n\fTrapping and cooling atoms\n\n61\n\nexpression for the diffusion constant [52], we can estimate the detuning for which we\nexpect minimum diffusion and temperature. For the value of the saturation parameter\ns . 0.1 used throughout this section, it can be shown that TM attains a minimum at\ndetunings of up to several tens of linewidths. Our chosen parameters are therefore within\nthe range of validity of the model.\n\n2.6.5\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nIn conclusion, we have presented a mechanism for cooling particles by optical means\nwhich is based fundamentally on the dipole interaction of a particle with a light beam\nand therefore does not rely on spontaneous emission. The particle is assumed to be\ntrapped and is simultaneously driven by an off-resonant laser beam. After the interaction\nwith the particle the beam is reflected back onto the particle by a distant mirror. The\ntime-delay incurred during the light round-trip to the mirror and back is exploited to\ncreate a non-conservative cooling force.\nThe system was analysed using stochastic simulations of the semiclassical equations of\nmotion representing a single two-level atom coupled to a continuum of electromagnetic\nmodes. The results of these computations were found to agree with the expectations of\na perturbative analysis. Our models predict sub-mK steady-state temperatures for 85 Rb\natoms interacting with a tightly focussed laser beam several metres from the mirror, in\nan arrangement similar to that of Ref. [103]. While most of the theory is presented for a\none-dimensional model, results for the friction force in the transverse direction suggest\nthat three-dimensional cooling is possible with this scheme.\nThe model presented here requires a large separation between the atom and the mirror,\nof the order of several metres, for an observable cooling effect. This limitation can be\novercome in several ways. First, the light could propagate in an optical fibre between\nthe atom and the mirror to avoid the effects of diffraction. Second, the required delayed\nreflection could be achieved through the use of a cavity instead of a mirror; in contrast\nto cavity-mediated cooling schemes [19, 104\u2013107], the atom would remain external to\nthe cavity. For a time delay \u03c4 of order 1 ns one would require a cavity quality factor Q =\n\u03c9\u03c4 [108] of the order of 106 \u2212 107 , which is achievable with present-day technology [109].\nThis mechanism is explored heuristically in Section 2.7.1, and subsequently investigated\n\n\f62\n\nTrapping and cooling atoms\n\nin greater depth in Section 4.1, after we have developed the necessary mathematical\ntools.\n\n2.6.A\n\nAppendix: A note on units\n\nThe units used in the preceding work can perhaps best be called 'quantum mechanical'.\nHere, we provide a number of useful conversions and numerical values, which could be\nof benefit to readers with a more experimental leaning.\n\nQuantity in this work\nA\ng\n\nExperimental value\nq\n\u0001\n2 2\u03c0P/ ~kL\nq\n\u0001\n\u0393\u03c3a / \u03c0\u03c3L\n\ng 2 |A|2 /\u22062L = 8\u0393P \u03c3a / ~kL \u03c3L \u22062L\n\ns\n\n\u0001\n\nIn the above, P is the incident travelling-wave electromagnetic power, related to the\nincident electric field E by\n\nP = 12 \u000f0 c\u03c3L |E|2 .\n\n(2.49)\n\n\u0393 is the HWHM linewidth of the upper state.

In\nthe present section, we will explore other geometries with which we can investigate the\n\n\f63\n\nTrapping and cooling atoms\n\nretarded dipole\u2013dipole interaction. The ideas developed here will be fleshed out in later\nchapters, after we develop the necessary formalisms, but it is fairly instructive at this\nearly stage to intuitively explore how the different mechanisms arise from very similar\nphysical arguments.\nLet us first start by addressing the two major issues with the mirror-mediated cooling\nmechanism as described in the previous section. To recapitulate, the cooling force in\nthis mechanism arises from the retarded dipole\u2013dipole interaction of a particle with its\nown reflection in a mirror but (i) requires a distance of 'several metres' between the\nparticle and the mirror for a sizeable effect, and (ii) the friction force oscillates between\ncooling and heating on a sub-wavelength scale and has a zero spatial average.\nFollowing the discussion of these two points, we will turn our attention to three-dimensional\ngeometries to see how we can exploit the focussing properties of optics to achieve cooling.\n\n2.7.1\n\nLengthening the time delay: External cavity cooling\n\nFrom the general arguments in Section 2.4, as well as the expressions in Section 2.6, we\ncan see that the time delay is what governs the overall strength of the friction force in\nthe retarded dipole\u2013dipole interaction. This can be exploited in what we term 'external\ncavity cooling' (Section 4.1), where the particle to be cooled interacts with a cavity field\ndespite being outside the cavity. The nature of the interaction here is practically identical\nto mirror-mediated cooling; in particular, it suffers from the same drawback of having\nthe friction force oscillate between a cooling and a heating force several times over the\nspace of a single wavelength. Nevertheless, this is not a problem if what is to be cooled is\nnot the motional energy of an atom but that of a micromirror since (i) a micromirror can\nbe positioned, using piezoelectric actuators, with sub-nanometre-scale resolution [113],\nand (ii) the oscillation amplitude for the Brownian motion of a micromirror is also in\nthe picometre to nanometre range. To illustrate the latter point, let us use the effective\nspring constant of a commercially-available micromirror as calculated in Ref. [114], kM =\n28 N m-1 . Then, the RMS displacement for the micromirror at a temperature T = 300 K,\ncalculated as\n\nis of the order of 10\u221211 m.\n\np\nhx2 i =\n\nr\n\nkB T\n,\nkM\n\n(2.50)\n\n\fTrapping and cooling atoms\n\n64\n\nFigure 2.11: Space\u2013time diagram showing the distance folding argument used to\nexplain the action of external cavity cooling. This figure should be compared to Fig. 2.2.\nThe blank arrow indicates the pump beam.\n\nHaving established the rationale, then, we can introduce 'external cavity cooling' by\nmeans of the distance folding argument (see Fig. 2.11). For suppose we place a particle\n(atom or micromirror) in front of a cavity. The light that interacts with the particle\nis then allowed to couple into the cavity. This light then undergoes several round trips\ninside the cavity, and with each round-trip some light leaks out and re-interacts with\nthe particle. An effective delay time can be defined that is related to the finesse (or,\nequivalently, the linewidth) of the cavity, and it is this concept that we show in Fig. 2.11.\nOne notes that this delay time is, for a good cavity, orders of magnitude larger than\nthat due to either mirror separately. Using a good cavity, with a finesse of the order of\n105 , thereby allows us to squeeze the 'several metres' into a sub-millimetre-scale device.\nThis opens the door to several important advances, of which we mention a few here.\nFirst of all, one is not constrained to use Fabry\u2013P\u00e9rot-type cavities, whereby the system\ncan be constructed monolithically on a chip-scale device. Secondly, the cavity does not\nneed to have good optical or mechanical access, which allows one to make significantly\nbetter and more stable cavities. Finally, having the micromirror or atom outside the\ncavity means that there is less chance of burning or saturation effects, since the local\nfield surrounding the particle is not amplified by the cavity.\n\n2.7.2\n\nLifting the sub-wavelength dependence: Ring cavity cooling\n\nA cursory physical analysis of the mirror-mediated cooling mechanism will reveal that\nthe origin of the sin(4kL x0 ) dependence lies in the fact that the atom is in a standing\n\n\f65\n\nTrapping and cooling atoms\n\n(a) Mirror-Mediated Cooling\n\n(b) Ring Cavity Cooling, position 1\n\n(c) Ring Cavity Cooling, position 2\n\nFigure 2.12: In (a) mirror-mediated cooling, the time delay depends on the atomic\nposition (\u03c41 6= \u03c42 ), whereas in (b, c) ring cavity cooling, it is independent of the atomic\nposition (\u03c41 = \u03c42 ). The blank arrow indicates the pump beam.\n\nwave inside a system that is not translationally invariant. To see this latter point, one\nsimply needs to observe that, with the atom at two different places the time delay is\nof course different. One way of restoring translational invariance into the system is\nby using a ring cavity, rather than a plane mirror, to introduce a delay; see Fig. 2.12.\nThe expectation of the physical mechanism being preserved, albeit without the position\ndependence in the friction force, is borne out when the system is examined in detail, as\nwe shall see in Section 4.3 after we have developed the necessary mathematical model.\n\n2.7.3\n\nExploiting three-dimensional electromagnetism\n\nPerhaps the two biggest conceptual differences between electromagnetism in one dimension and that in three dimensions are orthogonal polarisations (which can nevertheless\nbe mathematically mimicked in a quasi-one-dimensional geometry) and the spreading\nout of waves. Indeed, a travelling wave in one dimension can be represented as\ncos[\u03c9(t \u2212 x/c)] ,\n\n(2.51)\n\nwhereby the amplitude of the wave is 1, for any value of x. In three dimensions, however [44] [see, for example, Eq. (9.19) in this reference], the amplitude of the electric\nfield is dependent on the distance r from the source, and scales as 1/r for r \u001d \u03bb. Thus,\n\n\f66\n\nTrapping and cooling atoms\n\n(a) Optical binding\n\n(b) Self\u2013tweezing, static\n\n(c) Self\u2013tweezing, moving\n\nFigure 2.13: In (a) optical binding, particle 2 is in a potential well caused by particle\n1. Self\u2013tweezing, (b), occurs when a particle is in a potential well caused by itself; if\nthe particle is moving, (c), it will experience a force opposing its motion. The blank\narrow indicates the pump beam and the thick black arrows the force.\n\nsuppose a particle has a dipole induced by a local electric field E. This dipole will subsequently emit a spherical wave, and let us suppose that we reflect this wave back onto\nthe dipole. The potential energy mediated by the interaction between the instantaneous\ndipole polarisation and the reflected field (which has travelled through a distance r) is,\nup to some phase and constants,\nU \u223c\u2212\n\nE2\n.\nr\n\n(2.52)\n\nWe can now apply the result in Eq. (2.15): the dipole will experience a friction force\nproportional to \u03c4 c/r3 = 1/r2 .\nThe spreading out of waves in three dimensions is but one instance of the more general\nconcept of (de)focussing of an electric field. Let us examine a simple way in which we\ncan exploit this idea, self-tweezing. Optical binding [115], Fig. 2.13(a), is an interesting\nphenomenon whereby light incident on a dielectric sphere is focussed by the sphere\nitself. This focus, in turn, produces a potential well for a second particle, which is\nthereby optically bound to the first. Suppose, then that we only have one particle, and\nthat we put a plane mirror 'downstream' of that particle, Fig. 2.13(b). The mirror will,\nif the geometry is chosen properly, cause the focus to appear close enough to the particle\nthat it will feel the potential well caused by this electric field. This situation, then is\nsimilar to the case with two particles, but the single particle is now optically bound to\nitself. Any motion of the particle around this position will cause its image to lag behind\nit and a restoring, viscous, force to act on it, Fig. 2.13(c).\n\n\fPart II\n\nScattering Models\n&\nTheir Applications\n\n67\n\n\fChapter 3\n\nThe transfer matrix model\nThe reader might wonder why it is of interest, physically, to consider n-manifolds\nfor which n is larger than 4, since ordinary spacetime has just four dimensions.\nIn fact many modern theories [...] operate within a 'spacetime' whose dimension is\nmuch larger than 4.\nR. Penrose, The Road to Reality (2004)\n\nChapter 1, and in particular Section 1.4, developed the necessary tools to describe the\ninteraction of an atom with the electromagnetic field, as parametrised by the atom's\ncharacteristic polarisability. In one dimension, one can succinctly describe the fields interacting with a linear scatterer through what is called the transfer matrix approach [47].\nRestricting ourselves to one spatial dimension is not an overly restrictive approximation,\ndespite the quote at the beginning of this chapter; the formalism that is discussed in\nthis chapter allows us to describe a wealth of physical situations. The purpose of this\nchapter is to extend this model significantly, enabling it to account for moving as well as\nstatic scatterers; this is done in Section 3.1 and the model that results is solved generally in Section 3.2. The extended model discussed here takes into account the first-order\nDoppler shift but not relativistic effects, and it is therefore correct only up to first order\nin the velocity of the scatterer.\nThe transfer matrix method is more general than an analysis based on modal decomposition, and is therefore used to describe the optomechanics of scatterers inside cavities\nin Section 3.3. This method is extended even further in Section 3.4, where it is shown\nthat the concept of polarisability can also be applied to atoms having a Zeeman manifold and interacting with circularly polarised light. The results of these sections are\n68\n\n\fThe transfer matrix model\n\n69\n\nconfirmed by showing that the standard results for optical molasses, mirror-mediated\ncooling and cooling of cavity mirrors, as well as sub-Doppler cooling mechanisms [14],\ncan be reproduced by simple applications of the transfer matrix method. In Chapter 4,\nthe theory developed over the present chapter will then be applied to describe two novel\ncooling schemes, outside cavities (Section 4.1) and inside ring cavities (Section 4.3).\n\n3.1\n\nAn extended scattering theory\n\nIn this first section we develop and present a scattering theory for optomechanically\ncoupled systems, allowing for the efficient description of the motion of arbitrary combinations of atoms and mirrors interacting through the radiation field. We will restrict\nthe model to one-dimensional motion and small velocities. The main building block is\nthe beamsplitter transfer matrix [47, 116], i.e., the local relation between light field amplitudes at the two sides of a scatterer. We will calculate the radiation force acting on a\nmoving scatterer up to linear order in the velocity. The model is completed by including\nthe quantum fluctuations of the radiation force which stem from the quantised nature\nof the field. We will determine the momentum diffusion coefficient corresponding to the\nminimum quantum noise level.\nOne system we will consider in some detail is composed of two mirrors; one of them\nis fixed in space, whilst the other one is mobile. This is the generic scheme for radiation pressure cooling of moving mirrors [117\u2013119]. At the same time, in the limit of\nlow reflection the moving mirror can equally well represent the a single atomic dipole\ninteracting with its mirror image in front of a highly reflecting surface (Section 2.6; see\nalso Refs. [41, 103, 120]).\nThe work in this chapter is published as Xuereb, A., Domokos, P., Asb\u00f3th, J., Horak, P.,\n& Freegarde, T. Phys. Rev. A 79, 053810 (2009) and Xuereb, A., Freegarde, T., Horak,\nP., & Domokos, P., Phys. Rev. Lett. 105, 013602 (2010) and is in part reproduced\nverbatim. After our initial exploration of the transfer matrix description of moving\nscatterers, we subsequently apply this description to several systems, and also extend it\nin several ways. The resulting model is very general and can be solved to give analytical\nformulations of the friction forces and momentum diffusion processes acting in a generic\noptomechanical system.\n\n\f70\n\nThe transfer matrix model\n\nFigure 3.1: The four different modes that interact through a point-like beamsplitter\nin one dimension.\n\n3.1.1\n\nBasic building blocks of the model\n\nConsider a point-like scatterer (or beamsplitter), BS, moving along the 'x' axis on the\ntrajectory xBS (t).

Our first goal\nis the derivation of the transfer matrix M connecting the field amplitudes on the right\nto those on the left side of a beamsplitter moving at a fixed velocity v. This relation is well-known [47] for an immobile scatterer. Therefore, let us first transform the\nelectromagnetic field into a frame moving with the instantaneous velocity v of the BS.\n\n3.1.1.1\n\nTransfer matrix for an immobile beamsplitter\n\nIn the frame co-moving with the BS, the interaction of the field with the scatterer at\nx0 = 0 can be characterised by the single parameter \u03b6 by means of the one-dimensional\n1\n\nThis is a simplifying assumption and all our results also hold for a continuum of field modes.\n\n\f71\n\nThe transfer matrix model\nwave equation [44, 47],\n\u0012\n\n\u2202x20\n\n\u0013\n1 2\n2\n\u2212 2 \u2202t0 E 0 (x0 , t0 ) = 2 \u03b6 \u03b4(x0 ) \u2202t20 E 0 (x0 , t0 ) .\nc\nkc\n\n(3.3)\n\nThe electric field can be considered in a modal decomposition similar to Eq.

A similar statement holds for\nD(k).\n\nStarting from the knowledge of the incoming field amplitudes, this transfer matrix allows\nfor calculating the total electromagnetic field around a beamsplitter moving with a fixed\nvelocity.

Since the broadening is\n\ndue to the Doppler shift, \u2206 \u223c 2\u03c90 vc , where v is the speed of the beamsplitter.

The time needed to reach the stationary regime of scattering is\ntypically much shorter and thus this condition imposed on the averaging time \u03c4 can be\nsafely fulfilled.\nThe force on the medium is given by the surface integral of T xx on the surface, S, of a\nfictitious volume V = \u03c3L \u03b4l enclosing the medium, where \u03c3L is the mode area and \u03b4l the\ninfinitesimal length of the volume along the 'x' axis.

An identical result holds when we\nR\nreplace the discrete sum over k by an integral, defining A = [~\u03c90 /(2\u03c3L \u000f0 c)]\u22121/2 A(k)dk,\netc.\n\n\f75\n\nThe transfer matrix model\n3.1.1.4\n\nQuantum fluctuations of the force\n\nIn the previous section the force was derived based on the assumption that the field amplitudes are c-numbers. In order to describe the inherent quantum fluctuations of the\nforce, we need to resort to the quantum theory of fields and represent the mode amplitudes by operators: A(k) \u2192 \u00c2(k). To leading order the fluctuations of the force acting\non a beamsplitter amount to a momentum diffusion process [14, 121]. The diffusion\ncoefficient will be evaluated in the case of coherent-state fields [122].\nThe diffusion coefficient can be deduced from the second-order correlation function of\nthe force operator, Eq. (1.54). The evaluation of this quantum correlation is systemspecific. Quantum correlations, i.e., the operator algebra of the mode amplitudes \u00c2(k),\nB\u0302(k), \u0108(k), and D\u0302(k), are influenced by multiple scattering and thus depend on the total\ntransfer matrix of the entire system. The simplest case is a single beamsplitter at rest\nwhere the \"input\" modes B\u0302(k) and \u0108(k) have independent fluctuations. The calculation,\ndelegated to Appendix 3.1.B, includes all the steps needed for the treatment of a general\nsystem. The diffusion coefficient for a single beamsplitter is obtained as\n\u0010\n2\nD = (~k)2 A + B\n\n2\n\n+ C\n\n2\n\n+ D\n\n2\n\n\u0011\n+ 2 Re{rA\u2217 B \u2212 tA\u2217 C} + 2 Re{rD\u2217 C \u2212 tD\u2217 B} ,\n\n(3.19)\n\nwhere A = h\u00c2i, B = hB\u0302i, C = h\u0108i, D = hD\u0302i are the photo-current amplitudes (their\nmodulus square is of the units of 1/sec), obeying Eq. (3.11) for v = 0.\nAs an example, let us consider the diffusion coefficient for a two-level atom illuminated by\ncounter-propagating monochromatic light waves. Using the polarisability \u03b6, the transmission and reflection coefficients can be expressed as t = 1/(1 \u2212 i\u03b6) and r = i\u03b6/(1 \u2212 i\u03b6),\nrespectively [see Eq. (3.6)]. Eq.

Second- and higher-order terms in |\u03b6| correspond to the backaction of the atom on the field and are usually absent in treatments of laser cooling\ndue to the fact that |\u03b6| \u001c 1 is generally implicit in such treatments. Note that the\ndiffusion process due to the recoil accompanying the spontaneous emission of a photon\n\n\f76\n\nThe transfer matrix model\n\n(see Ref. [52]) is missing from this result. The detailed modelling of absorption, i.e.,\nscattering photons into the three-dimensional space, is not included in our approach.\n\n3.1.1.5\n\nExample: Force on a moving beamsplitter\n\nWe will now use Eq. (3.18) to derive a general expression for the force on a moving\nbeamsplitter illuminated by two counterpropagating, monochromatic, plane waves with\namplitudes B0 and C0 . On using Eq.

Note, however, that the scattering theory leads to a more general\nresult which is represented by the terms of higher order in \u03b6. These terms describe\nthe back-action of the scatterer on the field, which we re-iterate is generally neglected\nin free-space laser cooling theory. The general result in Eq.

This is a very general class and we will only focus on such scatterers in\nthe following.\n\n3.1.2\n\nGeneral system of a fixed and a mobile scatterer\n\nConsider the model in Fig. 3.2 where the scatterer, or 'atom', has a polarisability \u03b6\nconstant over the frequency range of interest.

Note that the freepropagation transfer matrix Mp is non-uniform in the k-space, and therefore the Doppler\nshift has an influence on the phase shift accumulated between two scattering events.\nThe boundary condition is set as follows. We assume that there is no incoming field\nfrom the right; therefore C(k) = 0 for all k. The incoming field from the left is assumed\nto be monochromatic, B(k) = B \u03b4(k \u2212 k0 ), with k0 being the pump wavenumber. The\nresulting field comprises modes with wavenumbers in a narrow region around k0 . In the\nlaboratory frame the field mode A(k) interacts with B(k \u2212 2k vc ) and C 0 (k) through the\nDoppler shift, and similarly for D0 (k).

The main virtue of our approach is clearly seen,\nin that we can smoothly move from \u03b6 = 0, which indicates the absence of the mobile\nscatterer, to |\u03b6| \u2192 \u221e, which corresponds to a perfectly reflecting mirror, i.e., a moving\nboundary condition for the electromagnetic field.\nLet us outline some of the generic features of the above calculation that would be\nencountered in a general configuration of scatterers. By using the formal Doppler shift\noperators, we benefit from the transfer matrix method in keeping the description of\nthe system as a whole within 2 \u00d7 2 matrices. The input-output relation for the total\nsystem is always obtained in a form similar to that of Eq. (3.29). As long as the Doppler\nbroadening is well below the transient time broadening of the system, the calculation of\nforces and diffusion requires solely the sum of the mode amplitudes. An important point\nis that the integrated action of the Doppler shift operator P\u0302v on monochromatic fields\nis a shift in k-space. Therefore, by interchanging the order of terms and putting the P\u0302v\nterms just to the left of the input field amplitudes, they can be eliminated, such as in\nEq. (3.30). Finally, up to first order in v/c, the resulting power series, a trace of multiple\nreflections, can be evaluated in a closed form, as shown in Eq. (3.31). In conclusion,\nthe illustrated method lends itself for the description of more complex schemes, for\nexample, the cooling of a moving, partially reflective mirror in a high-finesse FabryPerot resonator [123]. This scheme, however, rapidly increases in complexity with the\nsummations becoming potentially unmanageable. An alternative is possible, in that the\nmatrix M\u0302 is invertible to first order in v/c so that F and D can be evaluated in closed\nform for a mobile scatterer in a generic optical system. We will investigate this solution\nin Section 3.2 after some illustrative examples.\n\n\f80\n\nThe transfer matrix model\n3.1.2.1\n\nForce acting on the mobile scatterer\n\nTo obtain the force on the moving scatterer, we also need to evaluate C 0 (k) and D0 (k):\n\uf8f9\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u0001\nA(k)\n1 \u2212 i\u03b6\n\u2212i\u03b6 1 \u2212 2 vc P\u03022v\n\uf8fb\uf8ed\n\uf8f8,\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8=\uf8f0\n\u0001 \u22121\ni\u03b6 1 + 2 vc P\u03022v\n1 + i\u03b6\nB(k)\nD0 (k)\n\uf8eb\n\nC 0 (k)\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8ee\n\n(3.32)\n\nwhere we applied the inverse of the transfer matrix Ma .

(3.31). The cooling coefficient %, defined through\nthe relation F = \u2212%v, is plotted in Fig. 3.3 as a function of the position x in a halfwavelength range for various values of \u03b6. When varying the coupling strength from\n\u03b6 = 0.01 up to \u03b6 = 1, the cooling coefficient transforms between two characteristic\nregimes. For small coupling the linear velocity dependence tends to a simple sinusoidal\nfunction while, for large coupling, the friction exhibits a pronounced resonance in a\nnarrow range. This resonance arises from the increased number of reflections between\nthe mobile scatterer and the fixed mirror. It can be observed that the resonance shifts\ntowards k0 x = \u03c0 on increasing \u03b6. In the opposite limit of small \u03b6, the maximum friction\n\u0001\nis obtained periodically at n \u2212 41 \u03c0/2 according to the sinusoidal function. The position\n\nof the maximum friction is plotted in Fig. 3.4(a), showing the transition from 7\u03c0/8 to\n\u03c0.

(3.31) and Eq. (3.36) with\nk0 L = 2\u03c0 \u00d7 100. The fixed mirror is assumed to be a perfect mirror. In order to fit all\nthe curves into the same range, they are divided by the factors indicated in the figure.\nNote that x is defined differently from Fig. 2.3; the mobile scatterer here is closer to\nthe fixed mirror for increasing x.\n\nof \u03b6 2 behaviour, in the limit of small \u03b6, and \u03b6 6 behaviour, in the limit of large \u03b6. These\ntwo cases are described in Section 3.1.3 and Section 3.1.4, respectively.\n\n3.1.2.2\n\nDiffusion coefficient\n\nThe calculation of the diffusion coefficient proceeds along the same lines as that corresponding to a single beamsplitter, shown in Appendix 3.1.B. The difference is that\nthe modes B(k) and C 0 (k) around the mobile scatterer are not independent, for the\nreflection at the fixed mirror mixes them. Therefore, all the modes A, B, C 0 , and D0\nhave to be expressed in terms of the leftmost and rightmost incoming modes, B(k) and\nC(k), respectively. Instead of the derivation of such a general result for the diffusion,\nhere we will restrict ourselves to the special case of r = \u22121 (\u21d4 perfect mirror) and real\n\u03b6 (\u21d4 no absorption in the moving mirror). In this special case the diffusion calculation\nsimplifies a lot, because (i) the perfect mirror prevents the modes C from penetrating\ninto the interaction region, and (ii) quantum noise accompanying absorption does not\nintrude in the motion of the scatterer.\nOnly the modes B\u0302(k) impart independent quantum fluctuations.

(b) A similar plot, showing the maximum friction force as\na function of \u03b6 (on a log-log scale) with k0 L = 2\u03c0 \u00d7 100. In the limit of small \u03b6, the\nforce scales as \u03b6 2 [cf. Eq. (3.41); dashed line] whereas in the limit of large zeta it scales\nas \u03b6 6 [cf. Eq. (3.48); dotted line].\n\nforce correlation function given in Eq.

The fixed mirror is a perfect mirror.\n\nr = \u22121 and Im{\u03b6} = 0, declared above.\nTo be consistent with the calculation of the friction force linear in velocity, the diffusion\nshould be evaluated only for v = 0. From the ratio of these two coefficients, the steadystate temperature can be deduced. The velocity-independent components of the modes\nobey the following relations: A = 1 and C0 = D0 (all incoming power is reflected).\nTherefore the diffusion coefficient further simplifies,\n\nD = 4~2 k02 B 1 \u2212\n\n1\n1 \u2212 i\u03b6 + i\u03b6e\u22122ik0 x\n\n2\n\n!2\n\n.\n\n(3.38)\n\nIn Fig. 3.5, the temperature kB T = D/%, is plotted as a function of the scattering\nparameter \u03b6.

The two limits of small and large\nscattering parameter \u03b6 will be analysed in Section 3.1.3 and Section 3.1.4, respectively.\n\n3.1.3\n\nAtom in front of a perfect mirror\n\nAn atom pumped with a far off-resonance beam can be modelled as a moving mirror\nwith small and real \u03b6. In this section we accordingly truncate our expressions to second\n\n\f84\n\nThe transfer matrix model\n\norder in \u03b6. We also assume that the fixed mirror is perfect; i.e., r = \u22121 and t = 0.

Using Eq. (3.30) and Eq. (3.39),\nwe obtain:\n\u0002\n\u0003\nA = \u2212e\u22122ik0 x +\u03b6(i\u22122ie\u22122ik0 x +ie\u22124ik0 x )+\u03b6 vc \u22122i+2ie\u22124ik0 x \u22124k0 (L\u2212x)e\u22124ik0 x , (3.40)\nand\n\b\n\u0002\n\u0003\nF = 4~k0 B \u03b6 sin(2k0 x) \u2212 \u03b6 2 2 sin2 (k0 x) 4 cos2 (k0 x) \u2212 1\n\u0002\n\u0003\u0001\n\u2212 \u03b6 2 vc 4 sin2 (2k0 x) \u2212 4k0 (L \u2212 x) sin(4k0 x) ,\n\n(3.41)\n\nin agreement with Eq. (2.34). In the far field (x \u001d \u03bb), the dominant friction term in the\npreceding expression is the last term, which renders the sin(4k0 x) position dependence\nshown in Fig. 4.2 for \u03b6 = 0.01.\nWe are now in a position to derive the diffusion coefficient for this system. By substituting Eq. (3.40) into Eq. (3.37) and setting v = 0, we obtain\nD = 8(~k0 )2 \u03b6 2 B .\n\n(3.42)\n\nThis allows us to estimate the equilibrium temperature for such a system at a position\nof maximum friction:\nT \u2248\n\n~\nkB \u03c4\n\n, where \u03c4 = 2(L \u2212 x)/c ,\n\n(3.43)\n\nwhich we note is identical in form to the Doppler temperature for a two-level atom\nundergoing free-space laser cooling [124], but where we have replaced the upper state\nlifetime, 1/\u0393, by the round-trip time delay between the atom and the mirror.2 Note that\nthis temperature corresponds to the constant value presented in Fig. 3.5 for \u03b6 < 0.1.\n2\n\nThis expression lacks the geometrical factor in Eq. (2.44); the reason for this is that the semiclassical\ntreatment of a TLA is, strictly speaking, inconsistent with the assumption Im{\u03b6} = 0; the dominant\nterm of the diffusion is then the first term in Eq. (3.20).\n\n\f85\n\nThe transfer matrix model\n\n3.1.4\n\nOptical resonator with mobile mirror\n\nAfter the small polarisability case of the previous section, we will now consider the\n|\u03b6| \u2192 \u221e limit. We again assume that the fixed mirror of the resonator is perfect, with\nr = \u22121, and that C = 0. For simplicity, we assume that the moving mirror has a real\npolarisability; i.e., it is lossless. We expand the field mode amplitudes as power series\nin v/c, such that A = A0 + vc A1 + . . . , and similarly for C 0 .\nLet us first calculate the field in the resonator for v = 0. It follows from Eq. (3.32) that\nC00 = (1 \u2212 i\u03b6)A0 \u2212 i\u03b6 = \u2212\n\ne\u22122i\u03c6\n,\n1 \u2212 i\u03b6 + i\u03b6e\u22122i\u03c6\n\n(3.44)\n\nwith \u03c6 = k0 d, which has a maximum at \u03c60 obeying\n1\ntan(2\u03c60 ) = \u2212 .\n\u03b6\n\n(3.45)\n\nIn the limit of \u03b6 \u2192 \u221e, the resonance is Lorentzian:\nC00 = \u2212\n\nh\n\ne\u22122i\u03c6\n\n2i(1 \u2212 i\u03b6) (\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c60 ) \u2212 i 4\u03b612\n\ni,\n\n(3.46)\n\nwith a width of 1/(4\u03b6 2 ).\nThe perfect mirror reflects the total power incoming from the left, B. Moreover, for real\n\u03b6, there is no absorption in the moving mirror, so the outgoing intensity has to be equal\nto the incoming one: A = 1. This is true if v = 0; for v 6= 0, the field can do work on the\nmirror. The expansion of the back-reflected intensity to linear order in velocity reads\nA = 1 + 2 vc Re{A\u22170 A1 }. Extracting the velocity-dependent terms for the general form of\nthe force in Eq. (3.36), it reduces to\n\b \u000e\n\u0001\nF1 = vc 4~k0 B\u03b6 Im A1 1 + i\u03b6 \u2212 i\u03b6e2i\u03c6 ,\n\n(3.47)\n\nwhich, after some algebra, leads to\nF1 = \u2212 12 vc ~k02 L\n\n\u03b64\n\n\u0014\u0010\n\n(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c60 )\n\u00153 B .\n\u00112\n1\n2\n+ (\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c60 )\n4\u03b6 2\n\n(3.48)\n\n\f86\n\nThe transfer matrix model\n\n\u0001\nOn substituting \u03ba = c/ 4L\u03b6 2 , \u2206C = \u2212c(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c60 )/L, \u03b7 2 /(2\u03ba) = B, and G = c2 k02 /L2 ,\nthe friction force renders that derived from the usual radiation pressure Hamiltonian in\nAppendix 3.1.C.\nExpressing the field modes interacting with the mobile mirror in terms of the input field\nmode and performing a calculation similar to that leading to Eq. (3.19) readily gives\nD \u2248 4(~k0 )2 |C00 |4 B \u2248\n\n4\u03b6 4\n\n\u0014\u0010\n\n(~k0 )2 B\n\u00152 .\n\u00112\n1\n+ (\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c60 )2\n4\u03b6 2\n\n(3.49)\n\nThe resulting temperature thereby attains a minimum at 4\u03b6 2 (\u03c6\u2212\u03c60 ) = 1, i.e., \u2206C = \u2212\u03ba,\nin analogy with free-space Doppler cooling, at which point we have\nkB T \u2248\n\n~c\n= ~\u03ba .\n4\u03b6 2 L\n\n(3.50)\n\nAgain, this asymptotic behaviour is reflected in Fig. 3.5 for large \u03b6. We note the similarity of the preceding expression with the temperature of an atom cooled in a cavity, in\nthe good-cavity limit [102]. We conjecture that this is due to the fact that both systems\ncan be considered to involve the coupling of a laser with a system having a decay rate\n\u03ba. This result also holds for the case of an atom undergoing mirror-mediated cooling,\nas can be seen in Eq. (3.43).\nIt is also important to note that the above discussion only treats the effects of the\nlight fields on the scatterer. As such, the temperature limit, Eq. (3.50), is intrinsic to\nthe light forces, and the mechanical damping and heating processes present in a real,\nmacroscopic mirror-cooling setup are not taken into account. In practice, these heating\nprocesses may dominate over the heating induced by the quantum noise in the light\nfield [24, 125]. In such cases, radiation pressure cooling is a possible means to lower the\nequilibrium temperature owing to the additional, optical, damping process.\n\n3.1.A\n\nAppendix: The Doppler shift operator\n\nConsider the situation in Fig. 3.6, in the laboratory frame, where S is a scatterer, and\n\u0001\nsuppose that B and C are known. A(k) has contributions arising from both B k + 2k vc\n\n\f87\n\nThe transfer matrix model\n\nFigure 3.6: Reflection and transmission of a moving scatterer. B and C are the input\nfield modes, and A is the output field mode. A further output field mode ('D') is not\ndrawn because it is not relevant to our discussion here.\n\nand C(k), where k is any arbitrary wave number, written separately as:\nAB (k) = a1 B(k + 2k vc ) , and\n\n(3.51)\n\nAC (k) = a2 C(k) .\n\n(3.52)\n\nWe can therefore express A(k) as\nA(k) = a1 B(k + 2k vc ) + a2 C(k) .\n\n(3.53)\n\nDefining P\u0302v by P\u0302v : f (k) 7\u2192 f (k + k vc ), we have\nA(k) = P\u03022v a1 B(k) + a2 C(k) .\n\n(3.54)\n\nA similar expression, involving P\u0302v\u22121 = P\u0302\u2212v , holds for D(k). These two operators can\nthen be introduced into Eq. (3.5) as part of the Lorentz transformation, and thus into\nthe transfer matrix for the moving scatterer, giving rise to the form shown in Eq. (3.12).\nThe resulting transformation, for the transfer matrix M , of a scatterer moving with\nvelocity v can be written as:\n\uf8f9 \uf8ee\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n(1 + vc )P\u0302v\u22121\n(1 \u2212 vc )P\u0302v\n0\n0\n\uf8f0\n\uf8fbM \uf8f0\n\uf8fb,\n0\n(1 + vc )P\u0302v\u22121\n0\n(1 \u2212 vc )P\u0302v\n\n(3.55)\n\nto first order in vc , where the ordering of the elements of M is as described in the text.\nNote that this relation is general, in the sense that the elements of M can depend on k\n(see Section 3.1.1.5).\nFor any finite v, P\u0302v is trivially a bounded operator, having unit norm. This property\nR\nR\nfollows from the important relation P\u0302vm f (k)dk = f (k)dk, for any function f (k) and\n\nany integer m.\n\nThis operation can be generalised to n = 2, 3 pairs of modes in n orthogonal dimensions.\nIn two dimensions, this could correspond to a beamsplitter oriented at 45\u25e6 to the x-axis;\n\n\f88\n\nThe transfer matrix model\n\nin three dimensions, the beamsplitter would be oriented at 45\u25e6 to all three coordinate\naxes. We define a new operator by \u015ci (v) : f (k) 7\u2192 f (k + ki vci ei ), where ei is the\nunit vector along the ith coordinate axis, v is the velocity vector of the scatterer, and\nx = (x1 , x2 , . . . ) for any vector x. In particular, we have P\u0302v = \u015c1 (ve1 ).

The cross-correlation of these operators is not\ntrivial because of the boundary condition connecting the mode amplitudes A(k), B(k),\nC(k) and D(k). The input modes \u0108(k) and B\u0302(k) can be considered independent, and\nthe commutator is non-vanishing for the creation and annihilation operators of the same\n\n\f89\n\nThe transfer matrix model\nmode, e.g.,\nh\n\ni h\ni\n~\u03c9\nB\u0302(k), B\u0302 \u2020 (k 0 ) = \u0108(k), \u0108 \u2020 (k 0 ) =\n\u03b4k,k0 ,\n2\u000f0 V\nh\ni\nB\u0302(k), \u0108 \u2020 (k 0 ) = 0 ,\n\n(3.59)\n(3.60)\n\nassuming a discrete mode index of k, and a quantisation volume V = \u03c3L l with \u03c3L being\nthe mode area and l a fictitious total length of the space in one dimension.\nIn using Eq. (1.61), expressions for F correct to order n in v/c are compared to D to\norder (n \u2212 1) in this same parameter. Since our force expressions are accurate up to first\norder in v/c, therefore, we need only consider terms that contribute to the diffusion in\nthe v = 0 case. In the quantum description, the linear relation for the output modes is\nA(k) = tC(k) + rB(k) +\n\n\u221a\n\n\u000fE\n\n(3.61)\n\nD(k) = rC(k) + tB(k) +\n\n\u221a\n\n\u000fE ,\n\n(3.62)\n\nwhere the transmission t = 1/M22 = 1/(1\u2212i\u03b6), and reflection r = M12 /M22 = i\u03b6/(1\u2212i\u03b6),\nas above. The amplitude E represents the quantum noise fed into the system by the\n\u0001\nabsorption. For \u000f = 1 \u2212 |r|2 + |t|2 , this noise ensures that the output modes obey the\n\nsame commutation relations as the input ones, namely\nh\n\ni h\ni\n~\u03c9\n\u03b4k,k0 ,\n\u00c2(k), \u00c2\u2020 (k 0 ) = D\u0302(k), D\u0302\u2020 (k 0 ) =\n2\u000f0 V\nh\ni\n\u00c2(k), D\u0302\u2020 (k 0 ) = 0 .\n\n(3.63)\n(3.64)\n\nHowever, the linear dependence implies that commutators between input and output\nmode operators are\nh\n\ni\nh\ni\n\u00c2(k), B\u0302 \u2020 (k 0 ) = r B\u0302(k), B\u0302 \u2020 (k 0 ) ,\nh\ni\nh\ni\n\u00c2(k), \u0108 \u2020 (k 0 ) = t \u0108(k), \u0108 \u2020 (k 0 ) ,\n\n(3.65)\n(3.66)\n\nand similar relations hold for the cross-commutators with D(k).\nThe proper treatment of quantum fluctuations and the derivation of correlation functions\n\n\f90\n\nThe transfer matrix model\n\nrequire that the explicit time dependence be considered. Let us introduce the timevarying operators\n\u00e2(t) =\n\nX\n\n\u00c2(k)e\u2212i\u03c9t ,\n\n(3.67)\n\nk\n\n\u02c6\nand similarly for b\u0302(t), \u0109(t) and d(t).\nIt follows that\nh\n\ni\n~\u03c9 X \u2212i\u03c9(t\u2212t0 )\n~\u03c9\n\u00e2(t), \u00e2\u2020 (t0 ) =\n\u03b4(t \u2212 t0 ) .\ne\n\u2248\n2\u000f0 V\n2c\u000f0 \u03c3L\n\n(3.68)\n\nk\n\nHere we made use of the fact that the non-excited vacuum modes, having a bandwidth\nthat is much broader than that of the pump, also contribute to the summation, allowing\nus to approximate the summation as an integral over all frequencies. The Fourier-type\nintegral then yields \u03b4-function on the much slower timescale of interest. A similar com\u02c6\nmutation relation applies to the operators b\u0302(t), \u0109(t), and d(t).\nThe cross-commutators\ncan be derived directly from those concerning the modes, e.g.,\nh\n\ni\n~\u03c9\n\u00e2(t), b\u0302\u2020 (t0 ) = r\n\u03b4(t \u2212 t0 ) .\n2c\u000f0 \u03c3L\n\n(3.69)\n\nThe force operator is\n\u0002\n\u0003\nF\u0302 = \u03c3L T\u0302 xx (x \u2192 0+ ) \u2212 T\u0302 xx (x \u2192 0\u2212 ) ,\n\n(3.70)\n\nas before, where\n\nT\u0302 xx (x \u2192 0) =\n\n\uf8f1\nh\ni\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\u22122\u000f0 \u00e2\u2020 (t)\u00e2(t) + b\u0302\u2020 (t)b\u0302(t)\nh\ni\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\u22122\u000f0 \u0109\u2020 (t)\u0109(t) + d\u02c6\u2020 (t)d(t)\n\u02c6\n\nfor x \u2192 0\u2212\nfor x \u2192\n\n(3.71)\n\n0+\n\nis the quantised stress tensor. Assuming that the field is in a coherent state, in all\nnormally ordered products, the mode amplitude operators can be replaced by the corresponding coherent state amplitudes, which are c-numbers: e.g., \u00c2(k) \u2192 A(k) and\n\u00c2\u2020 (k) \u2192 A\u2217 (k). The force operator in Eq. (3.70) is normally ordered in this way; there-\n\nfore coherent-state fields render, as a mean value of the quantum expressions, the force\nEq. (3.18) derived from the classical theory based on the definition Eq. (3.17). Nontrivial quantum effects arise from non-normally ordered products, such as the fourthorder product terms of the second order correlation function of the force Eq. (1.54).\n\n\f91\n\nThe transfer matrix model\n\nThese terms can be evaluated straightforwardly by invoking the above-derived commutators to rearrange the product into normal order. As an example, consider\n\u00e2\u2020 (t)\u00e2(t)\u00e2\u2020 (t0 )\u00e2(t0 ) = \u00e2\u2020 (t)\u00e2\u2020 (t0 )\u00e2(t)\u00e2(t0 ) \u2212 \u00e2\u2020 (t)\u00e2(t0 )\n\n~\u03c9\n\u03b4(t \u2212 t0 ) .\n2c\u000f0 \u03c3L\n\n(3.72)\n\nFor radiation fields in coherent state, the first term is cancelled from the correlation\nfunction by the h\u00e2\u2020 (t)\u00e2(t0 )i2 term. The coefficient of \u03b4(t \u2212 t0 ) in the second term is in\nnormal order and can be replaced by c-numbers and then calculated identically as the\nforce in Section 3.1.1.5,\n\u00e2\u2020 (t)\u00e2(t) \u2248\n\nX\n\nA(k)\n\n2\n\n=\n\n~\u03c9\n|A|2 ,\n2c\u000f0 \u03c3L\n\n(3.73)\n\nin terms of the photo-current intensity |A|2 .\nAssembling all similar contributions, originating from the non-vanishing commutators\n[b, b\u2020 ], [c, c\u2020 ], [d, d\u2020 ], [a, b\u2020 ], etc., one obtains Eq. (3.19) presented in Section 3.1.1.4.\n\n3.1.C\n\nAppendix: Mirror cooling via the radiation pressure coupling\nHamiltonian\n\nWe describe a generic optomechanical system composed of a single, damped-driven field\nmode coupled to the motion of a massive particle, whose Hamiltonian is given by [126,\n127]\n\u0124 = ~\u03c9c \u00e2\u2020 \u00e2 + i~\u03b7(\u00e2\u2020 e\u2212i\u03c9t \u2212 \u00e2ei\u03c9t ) +\n\np\u03022\n+ V (x\u0302) + ~G\u00e2\u2020 \u00e2x\u0302 .\n2m\n\n(3.74)\n\nwhere \u00e2 and \u00e2\u2020 are the annihilation and creation operators, respectively, of the mode; x\u0302\nand p\u0302 are the position and momentum operators associated with the motion; and where\nwe drop the carets to signify expectation values. The mode is driven by a coherent field\nwith an effective amplitude \u03b7 and frequency \u03c9. This Hamiltonian describes, for example,\nthe radiation pressure coupling of a moving mirror to the field in a Fabry-Perot resonator.\nIn this case the coupling constant is G = \u03c9c /L, rendering the cavity mode frequency\ndetuning \u03c9c x/L provided the mirror is shifted by an amount x. Since the cavity mode\nis lossy with a photon escape rate of 2\u03ba, the total system is dissipative. Thereby, with\na proper setting of the parameters, in particular the cavity detuning \u2206C = \u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9C , the\n\n\f92\n\nThe transfer matrix model\n\nmirror motion can be cooled. We will determine the corresponding friction force linear\nin velocity.\nIn a frame rotating at frequency \u03c9, the Heisenberg equation of motion for the field mode\namplitude reads\n\u00e2 \u0307 = [i(\u2206C \u2212 Gx\u0302) \u2212 \u03ba] \u00e2 + \u03b7 .\n\n(3.75)\n\nwhere the noise term is omitted. We assume that the mirror moves along the trajectory\nx(t) \u2248 x+vt with fixed velocity v during the short time that is needed for the field mode\nto relax to its steady-state. The variation of \u00e2 arises from the explicit time dependence\nand from the motion of the mirror. A steady-state solution is sought in the form of\n\u00e2 \u2248 \u00e2(0) (x) + v\u00e2(1) (x). On replacing this expansion into the above equation, and using\nthe hydrodynamic derivative\n\nd\ndt\n\n\u2192\n\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n\n\u2202\n+ v \u2202x\n, one obtains a hierarchy of equations of\n\ndifferent orders of the velocity v. To zeroth order the adiabatic field is obtained as\na(0) =\n\n\u03b7\n.\n\u2212i(\u2206C \u2212 Gx) + \u03ba\n\n(3.76)\n\nThe linear response of a to the mirror motion is then\na(1) =\n\n1\n\u2202 (0)\ni\u03b7G\na =\u0002\n\u00033 .\ni(\u2206C \u2212 Gx) \u2212 \u03ba \u2202x\n\u2212 i(\u2206C \u2212 Gx) + \u03ba\n\n(3.77)\n\nThe force acting on the mirror derives from the defining equation p\u0302 \u0307 = ~i [\u0124, p\u0302] = \u2212~G\u00e2\u2020 \u00e2\nand, up to linear order in velocity, is\no\nn\n~\u03b7 2 G2 \u03ba\u2206C\nF1 = \u22122v~G Re a(0)\u2217 a(1) = 4v\n\u00013 ,\n\u22062C + \u03ba2\n\n(3.78)\n\nwhere we used x = 0 without loss of generality. It can be seen that mirror cooling\nrequires that \u2206C < 0, i.e., the cavity resonance frequency is above the pump frequency.\nIn this case, for efficient excitation of the field in the resonator, the frequency of the pump\nphotons is up-shifted at the expense of the mirror's kinetic energy. This cooling force has\nbeen derived in Section 3.1.4, as a limiting case of the more general scattering theory.\nTo check the perfect agreement between the two results, the quantity corresponding to\n\u03b7 can be deduced from the total field energy in the resonator for an immobile mirror,\nwhich is ~\u03c9C \u00e2(0)\u2020 \u00e2(0) here.\n\n\f93\n\nThe transfer matrix model\n\n3.2\n\nGeneral solution to the transfer matrix approach\n\nThe approach used to find F in the previous section illustrates the nature of this quantity,\narising from the multiple round-trips of the light between the static and moving mirrors,\nvery well. However, the series summation does not lend itself to easy direct evaluation in\na mechanical fashion. By rewriting the Doppler shift operator, however, this limitation\ncan be lifted and F and D evaluated for a fully general optical system. The basis of this\ncurrent section was published as Xuereb, A., Freegarde, T., Horak, P., & Domokos, P.\nPhys. Rev. Lett. 105, 013602 (2010), and will be elaborated on in a manuscript that is\ncurrently being prepared. In this section, we will first summarise the general transfer\nmatrix approach and show how solutions in closed form can be found to the friction\nforce, in Section 3.2.1, and momentum diffusion, in Section 3.2.2, acting on the scatterer.\nSection 3.3 subsequently explores the linear and nonlinear optomechanical coupling that\ncan be achieved between the field of a cavity and the position of a micromirror placed\ninside it.\nGiven a static scatterer represented by the transfer matrix M\u0302 , the effect of the motion of\nthe scatterer on the fields it is interacting with is included by applying the transformation\n[cf.

A complete theory based on the input-output operator formalism can be built\nalong the lines of the previous section. The results we have obtained so far correspond\n\n\f96\n\nThe transfer matrix model\n\nto assuming that the input fields are in a coherent state, see Section 3.1.1.4, whereby the\nfields A, B, etc., are the expectation values of analogous bosonic annihilation operators:\nh\u00c2i = A, h\u00c2\u2020 i = A\u2217 , and so on. The two input modes are the only independent modes\nin our system, and their corresponding operators obey the usual bosonic commutation\nrelations:\n\ni\nh\ni h\ni\nh\n~k0\nB\u0302l , B\u0302l\u2020 = \u0108r , \u0108r\u2020 =\n\u03b4(t \u2212 t0 ) , and B\u0302l , \u0108r\u2020 = 0 ,\n2\u000f0 \u03c3L\n\n(3.92)\n\nwith \u03c9 = kc being the (angular) frequency. Since we are working to first order in v/c,\nwe need to evaluate everything in this section to zeroth order in v/c.\nBesides photon number fluctuations, lossy beamsplitters also induce noise into the system; this is equivalent to having a noise mode \u00ca that modifies the output fields interacting with that component. The noise input in the system by any of its components is\nindependent of the noise input by any other component; in other words, if \u00ca1 and \u00ca2\nare two noise modes that interact with the system,\nh\n\ni h\ni\nh\ni\n~k0\n\u00ca1 , \u00ca1\u2020 = \u00ca2 , \u00ca2\u2020 =\n\u03b4(t \u2212 t0 ) , \u00ca1 , \u00ca2\u2020 = 0 ,\n2\u000f0 \u03c3L\n\n(3.93)\n\nh\u00ca1 i = h\u00ca2 i = 0 ,\n\n(3.94)\n\nand\n\nwith the last pair of equalities being true by construction. We can therefore treat each\nof the noise modes independently. Moreover, the noise modes are independent of the\ninput modes; for any such noise mode \u00ca:\nh\n\ni h\ni\n\u00ca, B\u0302l\u2020 = \u00ca, \u0108r\u2020 = 0 .\n\n(3.95)\n\nIn this section, we will generalise the treatment in Section 3.1 to the situation where\nthe loss-inducing beamsplitter is part of a generic optical system. Let us now assume,\nfor concreteness, that the moving scatterer S from Section 3.2.1 introduces the only\nnoise mode, \u00ca, in the system. In the case of an isolated scatterer, B\u0302 and \u0108 represent\nindependent input modes and the above equations guarantee that the two-time selfcommutators of \u00c2 and D\u0302 behave as expected; see Appendix 3.1.B.

In a recent experiment,\nSankey and co-workers [131] looked at both linear and nonlinear coupling between the\nmechanical degree of freedom of the micromirror and the cavity field. The physical\nmechanism by which optomechanical coupling, and subsequently cooling, is enhanced\nby the presence of the cavity can be looked at either using the standard theory of cavitymediated cooling [19, 75], in the case of weakly reflective micromirrors, or by considering\nthe micromirror to form the boundary between two coupled cavities [123, 130], in the\ncase of more strongly reflective micromirrors. The transfer matrix approach detailed in\nthe previous sections provides a natural way to explore this interaction no matter what\nthe optical properties of the micromirror are.\nWe begin by modelling the system in Ref. [114]: a two\u2013mirror Fabry-P\u00e9rot cavity with\na micromirror near its centre, operating at a wavelength \u03bb = 1064 nm and having a\nlength LC = 6.7 cm. The micromirror is modelled by its polarisability \u03b6 which, in light\nof the small losses observed in practice, is taken to be real and negative. Whereas the\nreal experimental system corresponds to \u03b6 & \u22121, we allow \u03b6 to vary freely in our model.\nThe two quantities of interest in this section are the intensity of the field close to the\n\n\f100\n\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n\u2206LC (units of wavelength)\n\n\u2206LC (units of wavelength)\n\nThe transfer matrix model\n\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n0.0\n\nMicromirror position, x (units of wavelength)\n\n0.1\n\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.2\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\nMicromirror position, x (units of wavelength)\n\n100\n\n0.4\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\nMicromirror position, x (units of wavelength)\n\n(h) \u03b6 = \u221210.000\nCooling coefficient, in units of N/(m s\u22121 )\n\nIntensity, in W\n\n10\u22125\n\n0.3\n\n1.0\n\n(g) \u03b6 = \u22125.000\n\n10\u221210\n\n0.2\n\nMicromirror position, x (units of wavelength)\n\n\u2206LC (units of wavelength)\n\n\u2206LC (units of wavelength)\n\n0.8\n\n0.3\n\n0.5\n\n(f) \u03b6 = \u22122.000\n\n1.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n(e) \u03b6 = \u22121.000\n\n0.1\n\n0.3\n\n0.6\n\nMicromirror position, x (units of wavelength)\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\nMicromirror position, x (units of wavelength)\n\n\u2206LC (units of wavelength)\n\n\u2206LC (units of wavelength)\n\n0.8\n\n0.3\n\n0.1\n\n(d) \u03b6 = \u22120.700\n\n1.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n\n0.8\n\n(c) \u03b6 = \u22120.500\n\n0.1\n\n0.4\n\n1.0\n\nMicromirror position, x (units of wavelength)\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.3\n\n(b) \u03b6 = \u22120.300\n\u2206LC (units of wavelength)\n\n\u2206LC (units of wavelength)\n\n(a) \u03b6 = \u22120.100\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\nMicromirror position, x (units of wavelength)\n\n105\n\n\u2212100\n\n\u221210\u221210\n\n10\u221210\n\n100\n\nFigure 3.8: Field intensity (left panels) at and cooling coefficient (right panels) acting\non the micromirror as the micromirror position (x) and cavity length (LC + \u2206LC ) are\nscanned.

We note qualitative agreement between the two models for x \u2248 0.25\u03bb and\nfor \u2206LC close to the resonances, especially for large |\u03b6|. The discrepancies between\nthe two sets of data, that are more pronounced for small polarisability, have significant\nconsequences for any theory based on a coupled-cavity modal decomposition model.\nThe black dashed lines [Eq.

Each\nsubfigure (a)\u2013(h) explores a different value for \u03b6. For \u03b6 \u2248 0, the cavity field is similar to\nthe bare-cavity field; in particular, the cavity resonances are only slightly perturbed by\nthe presence and position of the micromirror. The opposite is true of the \u03b6 \u001c \u22121 case,\nwhere there is strong coupling between pairs of cavity modes, typified by the avoided\ncrossings in the spectra. The resonance frequencies can be obtained analytically, in the\nlimit of a good bare cavity, as frequency shifts from the bare resonances:\n(\n\u0002\n\u0003)\n2 sin2 (2k x)\n\u03b6\ncos(2k\nx)\n\u2213\n\u03b6\n1\n+\n\u03b6\nc\n0\n0\n\u0002\n\u0003 ,\n\u2206\u03c9 =\ntan\u22121\nLC\n\u03b6 2 cos(2k0 x) \u00b1 1 + \u03b6 2 sin2 (2k0 x)\n\n(3.111)\n\nwith LC being the length of the cavity, x the position of the micromirror, and k0 = 2\u03c0/\u03bb\nthe wavenumber of the light inside the cavity. The two sets of solutions to Eq. (3.111)\nare, in the \u03b6 \u2192 0 limit or at x = \u03bb/8, separated by a free spectral range. These cavity\n\u0001\nresonances, plotted as detuned cavity lengths \u2206LC = LC /\u03c9 \u2206\u03c9, are traced by means\n\nof the dashed black curves in the left panels of Fig. 3.8.\n\nIn the standard optomechanical coupling Hamiltonian, the mirror\u2013field coupling is represented by a term of the form\n(1)\n\n\u0124OM \u223c ~\u03c9 0 x\u0302\u00e2\u2020 \u00e2 ,\n\n(3.112)\n\nwhere x\u0302 is the position operator of the mirror, and \u03c9 0 \u2261 \u2202(\u2206\u03c9)/\u2202x. \u00e2 is the annihilation\noperator of the field mode that has the dominant interaction with the micromirror; in\nthe |\u03b6| \u2192 0 limit, these field modes are the bare cavity modes of the whole cavity.\nHowever, as |\u03b6| increases, the micromirror effectively splits the main cavity into two\ncoupled cavities, giving rise to symmetric and antisymmetric modes, seen as the higher\n(bright) and lower (dark) branches in Fig. 3.8(h) for 0 < x < \u03bb/4; in such cases a is\nthe annihilation operator belonging to one of these eigenmodes. We note that similar\nbehaviour was observed in Ref. [129].\nCertain effects, such as mechanical squeezing of the mirror position [133] and quantum\nnon-demolition measurements on the mirror [134], require not linear coupling to x\u0302 but\nquadratic coupling to x\u03022 :\n(2)\n\n\u0124OM \u223c ~\u03c9 00 x\u03022 \u00e2\u2020 \u00e2 ,\n\n(3.113)\n\n\f104\n\nThe transfer matrix model\nwith \u03c9 00 \u2261 \u2202 2 (\u2206\u03c9)/\u2202x2 . In our notation, we have\n\u03c90 = \u2213\nand\n\u03c9 00 = \u2213\n\n\u03b6 sin(2k0 x)\n2k0 c\n,\n\u0002\nLC 1 + \u03b6 2 sin2 (2k0 x)\u00031/2\n4k02 c\n\u03b6 cos(2k0 x)\n.\n\u0002\nLC 1 + \u03b6 2 sin2 (2k0 x)\u00033/2\n\n(3.114)\n\n(3.115)\n\nOne thing we note immediately is that there is no value for x such that \u03c9 0 = \u03c9 00 = 0;\nin other words, the optomechanical coupling is restricted to be linear or quadratic, to\nlowest order. Higher-order nonlinearities may be achieved by coupling different transverse modes of the cavity (see, e.g., the experimental results in Ref. [131]) but are\noverwhelmed by the linear or quadratic couplings in a single-mode cavity. Moreover,\nthe linear coupling \u03c9 0 is bounded in the \u03b6 \u2192 \u221e limit:\n|\u03c9 0 | \u2264\n\n2k0 c\n\u2248 2\u03c0 \u00d7 8.42 MHz/nm ,\nLC\n\n(3.116)\n\nwith the numeric value corresponding to our parameters. In the same limit, \u03c9 00 exhibits resonant behaviour (see Fig. 3.9), indicative of avoided crossings in the spectrum,\npeaking at a value of:\n|\u03c9 00 | \u2192\n\n4k02 c\n|\u03b6| \u2248 2\u03c0 \u00d7 0.10 |\u03b6| MHz/(nm)2 .\nLC\n\n(3.117)\n\nWe plot the lower (\u2213 \u2192 \u2212) branches of Eqs. (3.114) and (3.115) in Fig. 3.9 for two values\nfor \u03b6: \u03b6 = \u22121, representative of realistic micromirrors, and \u03b6 = \u221210, representative\nof highly reflective micromirrors. These correspond to cases (e) and (h) in Fig. 3.8,\nrespectively. Coupling between the pairs of modes is not very strong for the \u03b6 = \u22121 case;\n\nthis is manifested by means of the smooth variation with x of \u03c9 0 and \u03c9 00 in Fig. 3.9(a).\nThe second case shows strong signs of the avoided crossing behaviour seen in Fig. 3.8(h),\nwith \u03c9 0 no longer behaving smoothly and \u03c9 00 acquiring a resonance-like character. Note\nthat, independently of the magnitude of \u03b6, the strongest quadratic coupling always\noccurs at the points where \u03c9 0 = 0.\nThe linear frequency shifts, Eq. (3.114) and the solid curves in Fig. 3.9, describe the\nsame quantity as do the curves in Fig. 5 of Ref. [123]. In other words, our results match\nthose in Ref. [123] in the relevant limit of a high-reflectivity micromirror, but the selfconsistent scattering solution presented here is also applicable to the general situation\n\n\fThe transfer matrix model\n\n105\n\nwhere \u03b6 can take any complex value. Thus, our 'micromirror' could represent an actual\nmicromirror, a poorly reflective membrane, or even an atom, whereas in the latter two\ncases the decomposition of the system into two coupled cavities is not valid. Fig. 3.10\npresents a comparison of the static force acting on the micromirror, for various values\nof \u03b6, as calculated both from the model presented in this work (left panels) and from a\nmodal decomposition model (Ref. [129], right panels). We note that the two sets of data\nagree in the large |\u03b6| limit, where the 'two coupled cavities' model is formally valid, but\nthere are significant qualitative differences when |\u03b6| \u001c 1, where the model used most\noften is that of a single cavity mode interacting with a scatterer [75].\nThe behaviour of the cooling coefficient acting on the micromirror, as shown on the\nright panels of Fig. 3.8, also has a number of interesting properties. Its overall trend\nfollows the structure of the field intensity closely, as can be seen from an inspection of\nthis figure. As is expected from earlier investigations [75, 129] optomechanical cooling\ninside cavities proceeds when the light pumped into the cavity is tuned below resonance.\nThis is shown quite clearly in Fig. 3.8, in that the friction force generally acts to cool\nthe micromirror when \u2206LC is smaller than the resonant length, and it acts to heat when\n\u2206LC is larger. One notes that for weak mirror\u2013field coupling [Fig. 3.8(a)] the behaviour\nof the cooling coefficient at a given \u2206LC close to resonance is approximately well-defined:\nthe motion of the mirror is either cooled or heated, almost irrespectively of the value of x.\nThe situation is qualitatively different for very strong mirror\u2013field coupling [Fig. 3.8(h)],\nwhere the cooling coefficient changes sign very rapidly as x is scanned over the resonance\nat a fixed \u2206LC . This has profound implications for experimental explorations, since the\nlocalisation of the micromirror within the cavity becomes of critical importance to the\nqualitative behaviour of the system.\n\n3.4\n\nOptical pumping and multilevel atoms\n\nThe work in this section is published as Xuereb, A., Domokos, P., Horak, P., & Freegarde,\nT. Phys. Scr. T140, 014010 (2010) and is reproduced essentially verbatim [135]. The\ntransfer matrix method described previously is extended here to handle multilevel atoms\nand arbitrarily polarised incident fields.\n\n\f106\n\nThe transfer matrix model\n\nFigure 3.11: Moving scatterer interacting with four field modes represented by the\nJones vectors A, B, C, and D. The scatterer has velocity v and is described by means\nof its polarisability tensor \u03b6. The field mode amplitudes are, in general, functions of\nthe wavenumber k.\n\nThe extended model we describe in the present section allows us to treat multi-level\natoms as classical scatterers in light fields modified by, in principle, arbitrarily complex\noptical components such as mirrors, resonators, dispersive or dichroic elements, or filters.\nAfter we introduce the general extension in the next section, we verify our formalism\nfor two prototypical sub-Doppler cooling mechanisms-the J =\n\n1\n2\n\n\u2192 J0 =\n\n3\n2\n\ntransition,\n\nleading to the Sisyphus cooling mechanism, and the J = 1 \u2192 J 0 = 2 transition-in\nSection 3.4.2 and Section 3.4.3, respectively, and show that it agrees with the standard\nliterature.\n\n3.4.1\n\nA transfer matrix relating Jones vectors\n\nWe investigate the interaction of atoms with light of different polarisations. To this end,\nwe denote the two polarisation basis vectors by \u03bc and \u03bd, whereby the standard circular\npolarisation basis is equivalent to setting \u03bc = \u03c3 + and \u03bd = \u03c3 \u2212 . Starting from the transfer\nmatrix model explored in Section 3.1 and using the definitions in Fig. 3.11, we replace\neach of the field modes by a corresponding Jones vector, similar to the model used in\nRef. [136]. Thus, for example,\n\uf8eb\n\nA(k) \u2192 A(k) = \uf8ed\n\nA\u03bc (k)\nA\u03bd (k)\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8,\n\n(3.118)\n\nand similarly for B, C and D, which are the mode amplitudes in the positive frequency\npart of the electric field.

(1.62). We note that this new transfer matrix\nstill allows us to model the interaction of the multilevel atom with an arbitrary system\nof immobile optical elements such as mirrors, cavities, waveplates, etc. As was done in\nSection 3.1, this interaction is accounted for by the multiplication of the various transfer\nmatrices of the elements making up the system; this model is, in principle, applicable\nto systems of arbitrary complexity.\nFinally, we recall that the diagonal elements, hi|\u03c1st |ii, of the steady-state density ma-\n\ntrix \u03c1st are the populations in each of the sublevels, whereas its off-diagonal elements,\n\nhi|\u03c1st |ji, are the respective coherences. The matrix elements of \u03c1st are obtained from\nthe appropriate optical Bloch equations (see, for example, the procedure outlined in\nRef. [137]). We note here that, through its dependence on \u03c1st , M depends on the fields\nthat it helps to determine, and thus Eq. (3.119) will in general become a set of nonlinear\nequations. In cases like the ones considered in the following sections, where only one\nmultilevel atom is interacting with a linear optical system, this problem may be solved\nusing a procedure similar to the one outlined below: the fields surrounding the atom are\nobtained from the input fields through linear operations and then used with the optical\nBloch equations to obtain the populations and coherences of the atom's various levels.\nKnowledge of these quantities then determines the fields, and hence the forces acting on\nthe atom, completely.\n\n\f108\n\nThe transfer matrix model\n\nFigure 3.12: Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for a J =\n\n1\n2\n\n\u2192 J0 =\n\n3\n2\n\ntransition.\n\nIn the following sections we will restrict our discussion to the case where the input field\nis not modified by other transfer matrices. We will apply this mechanism to investigate\nthe behaviour of atoms in two cases where the polarisation of the light varies in space\non scales of the order of the wavelength to verify the validity of the model given by\nEq. (3.122), Eq. (1.62), and Eq. (1.63). In the first instance, we illuminate our atom with\ntwo counterpropagating linearly polarised beams. We choose the planes of polarisation\nof the two beams to be orthogonal to each other. The second configuration we will\ninvestigate involves illuminating the atom with two circularly polarised beams, choosing\nopposite handedness for the two beams. These two cases mirror those in Ref. [14].\n\n3.4.2\n\nAtoms in a gradient of polarisation\n\nIn this and the following sections, we will adopt the low-intensity hypothesis. This\nallows us to simplify the optical Bloch equations and resulting system considerably by\nneglecting the populations and coherences of the excited state sublevels. We can thus\nreplace \u03c1st by the ground state steady-state density matrix, \u03c1st\ng . We denote the diagonal\nelement (i, i) of \u03c1st\ng , the population in sublevel i, by \u03a0i , and the off-diagonal element\n(i, j), the coherence between sublevels i and j, by Ci,j .\nHere we will discuss what is perhaps the simplest transition between two levels with\nmultiple magnetic sublevels: the J =\n\n1\n2\n\n\u2192 J0 =\n\n3\n2\n\ntransition. In this case, we have two\n\nground sublevels so that \u03c1st\ng is a 2 \u00d7 2 matrix. Fig. 3.12 tabulates the Clebsch-Gordan\ncoefficients required to evaluate \u03b6.

Specifically, we will relate the cavity HWHM\nlinewidth \u03ba, its finesse F, and its Q-factor to one another and to the reflectivity of the\ncavity mirrors.\n\n3.A.1\n\nCavity finesse\n\nThe finesse of a cavity is defined as\nF=\n\n\u2206\u03bb\n,\n\u03b4\u03bb\n\n(3.137)\n\nwhere \u03b4\u03bb is the FWHM linewidth of the cavity transmission peak and \u2206\u03bb is the free\nspectral range (FSR) of the cavity.

As a reference system for the analysis of the cooling\nforce in this setup, we also consider the mirror-mediated cooling configuration, which\nis the optomechanical cooling scheme used in many experiments [25, 139\u2013141].

Throughout most of this section, although not\ninitially, we consider in particular an object having low reflectivity, around 50%, which\ncorresponds to a polarisability \u03b6 = \u22121 and is representative of typical experimental\nconditions [139]. This ensures that a high-finesse resonator cannot be formed between\nthe object and the near mirror, thereby guaranteeing a parameter range where the\ncavity formed between the immobile mirrors dominates the interaction. For the sake of\nsimplicity, we restrict ourselves to the special case of scatterers that can be characterised\nby a real polarisability; this is equivalent to assuming that no absorption takes place in\nthe scatterer. Similar results hold when \u03b6 is not real.\nA numerical fit to Eq. (3.91) for |t| \u223c |T | and |\u03b6| \u001c 1 renders a friction force of the\napproximate form\nF \u2248 \u22128~k02 \u03b6 2 vc (2x + 0.17FL) sin(4k0 x + \u03c6)|B0 |2 ,\n\n(4.1)\n\nwhere F is the cavity finesse, L the cavity length (optimised as discussed below), x the\nseparation between the scatterer and the near mirror, and \u03c6 a phase factor. The gross\nspatial variation of the friction force is linear in both L and x; this is simply because of the\n\n\fApplications of transfer matrices\n\n117\n\nlinear increase of the retardation time of the reflected field with the distance between\nthe scatterer and the mirrors. This dependence is modulated by a wavelength-scale\noscillation of the friction force, which thereby follows the same oscillatory dependence\nas mirror-mediated cooling [cf. Eq. (3.41)] and constrains cooling to regions of the size of\n\u03bb0 /8, where \u03bb0 = 2\u03c0/k0 . In the case of a micro-mechanical mirror, where the vibrational\namplitude is naturally much less than the wavelength, this presents no problem. The\nform of Eq. (4.1) is dependent on the properties of the scatterer and of the mirrors;\nfor realistic mirrors and \u03b6 = \u22121, the enhancement factor 0.17F drops to 0.04F. With\n\ntypical experimental parameters this results in an enhancement of 103 \u2013104 over the\nstandard setup.\nAs shown in Fig. 4.1, the fine tuning of the cavity length by varying L on the wavelength\nscale shows a Lorentzian-like resonant enhancement of the friction amplitude (i.e., the\namplitude of the cooling coefficient), following that of the intracavity field intensity. If\nwe denote the complex reflectivities of the near and far mirror by r and R, respectively,\nwe can show that the peaks of Fig. 4.1 lie around the cavity resonances, at approximately\n\u0001\nL = 21 m\u03bb0 \u2212 2k10 arg rR , with m being an integer, and have approximately the same\np\n\u0001\n\u0001\nfull-width at half-maximum, 1 \u2212 |rR| / k0 |rR| = \u03bb0 /(2F). The enhancement of\n\nthe friction force by the cavity is due to the multiplication of the retardation time\nby the number of round trips in the cavity, which thereby acts as a 'distance folding'\n\nmechanism. For the chosen parameters, the optical path length is effectively 2x+0.04FL;\ni.e., determined predominantly by the cavity length L.\nThe friction force depends not only upon the retardation but also upon the cavity reflectivity, which drops near resonance in the well-known behaviour of a Fabry\u2013P\u00e9rot\nresonator. Fig. 4.2 shows the friction amplitude as a function of the near mirror transmissivity |t| for a fixed far mirror transmissivity, T = 1/(1 + 100i). We note that this\nnonideal reflectivity of the far mirror could equivalently arise from absorption, of ca.\n0.01% with the given parameters, of the incident power by the mirror. For each value\nof |t|, the cavity length L has been adjusted to maximise the friction force, according\nto curves such as those in Fig. 4.1. The calculated result follows the intracavity field\n(shown dashed) except where the cavity reflectivity drops near resonance [region (b)],\nand in the extremes of regions (a) and (c), where the geometry is dominated by the near\n(|t| \u2192 0) or far (|t| \u2192 1) mirrors, respectively. Fig. 4.3 shows the effect of the drop in\nreflectivity as the cavity is scanned through resonance for similar mirror reflectivities.\n\n\f118\n\nFriction amplitude (units of ~k0 vc |B0 |2 )\n\n105\n\n(b)\n\n(a)\n\n11\n\n10\n\n(c)\n104\n\n10\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n9\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n8\n\n10\n\n101\n7\n\n10\n\n100\n6\n\n10\n\n10-6\n\n10-5\n\n10-4\n\n10-3\n\n10-2\n\n10-1\n\nIntra-cavity photon number (units of |B0 |2 /\u01eb0 )\n\nApplications of transfer matrices\n\n100\n\nNear mirror transmissivity, |t|\n\n1.00\n\n0.50\n\n0.00\n\n1.00\n\n0.50\n\nPower reflectivity\n\nFriction amplitude (arb. units)\n\nFigure 4.2: Amplitude of the friction acting on a scatterer of polarisability \u03b6 = \u22121\ninteracting with a cavity tuned to achieve maximum friction, for varying transmissivity\nof the near mirror.

We note that the friction amplitude is not\nmaximised at the point of maximum intracavity field (t = T ) because more light is lost\nthrough the cavity for larger |t|.\n\n\fApplications of transfer matrices\n\n119\n\nThe external cavity cooling mechanism may prove particularly valuable when the scatterer is a small mirror or other micro-mechanical optical component. In such cases, the\nadvantage gained by using the external cavity over the standard optomechanical cooling\nscheme depends heavily upon the polarisability or reflectivity of the moving scatterer,\nwhich in the above calculations have so far been taken to be modest (\u03b6 = \u22121; |r| = 0.7)\nin comparison with those of the cavity mirrors. For |\u03b6| \u001c 1, the friction force is enhanced\nby a factor approximately equal to F because of the distance folding argument explained\nabove. For larger |\u03b6|, the system turns into a three\u2013mirror resonator and the advantage of external cavity cooling is not as big, but is still significant. For |\u03b6| \u2248 1 we find\nenhancement by a factor 0.04F, as discussed above. For even larger \u03b6, when the reflectivity of the moving mirror becomes comparable to that of the fixed mirrors, the scheme\nbehaves similarly to the mirror-mediated cooling configuration. The main heating process that counteracts the cooling effect in the case of micromirrors is thermal coupling\nto the environment, which depends on the geometry. In the case of isolated scatterers\nthat undergo no absorption, the heating is due to quantum fluctuations in the fields (see\n\u0001\nAppendix 3.1.B); the limit temperature here is \u2248 ~c/ 0.34kB FL = 1.87~\u03ba/kB when\n\n|\u03b6| \u001c 1, which evaluates to \u2248 0.1 mK for the parameters in Fig. 4.2. This expression for\nthe temperature conforms to the form expected from Eq. (2.45).\nThe usual cavity-mediated cooling mechanism [114, 142], where the moving scatterer\nis inside a two-mirror cavity, can also be described by our general framework in terms\nof Eqs. (3.87) and (3.91). Compared with this scheme, external cavity cooling has the\nadvantage of always having a sinusoidal spatial dependence; the narrow resonances in\nthe friction force for particles inside a cavity, as seen in the next section, impose more\nstringent positioning requirements.\n\n4.2\n\nCavity cooling of atoms: within and without a cavity\n\nIn Section 4.1 we explored the cooling of a micromirror outside a high-finesse cavity as\na means of enhancing the optomechanical interaction of the mirror with the field. Our\nformalism is general and, indeed, so are our results: the mechanism works similarly for\natoms. Inside a resonator, the enhancement of the interaction is accompanied by an\nenhancement in the field itself, which precludes using high optical powers in order not\nto saturate the atom. Outside a cavity, the enhancement in the friction force is lower,\n\n\fApplications of transfer matrices\n\n120\n\nbut the field itself is not amplified by the presence of a cavity, and therefore one can\nuse much higher powers. The important question, then, is whether these two effects\ncompensate for one another in such a way as to render the cooling forces experienced\nby an atom outside a cavity similar to those it experiences inside.\nTo answer this question we will first describe the two models, in Section 4.2.1.1 and Section 4.2.1.2, respectively, using realistic parameters for state-of-the-art optical devices.\nTaking into account saturation effects, it is seen that the two different models result in\nsimilar cooling forces and equilibrium temperatures. An examination of scaling properties of the force acting on the atom in the two schemes then follows in Section 4.2.2.\nThe work in this section has been accepted for publication in the Eur. Phys. J. D topical\nissue on Cold Quantum Matter \u2013 Achievements and Prospects.\n\n4.2.1\n4.2.1.1\n\nComparison of cavity cooling schemes\nCavity-mediated cooling: Atom inside the cavity\n\nPlacing a scatterer-atom [19\u201321], micromirror [114, 130], or 'point polarisable particle' [143]-inside a cavity has long been pointed out to be a generic means of cooling\nthe translational motion of that scatterer. Cooling of atoms inside resonators has been\nobserved: first [20] as a means of counteracting the heating of a trapped ion inside a\ncavity, leading to a steady-state occupation number for the motion of the atom of around\n20 quanta; and later [21] as an increase in the storage time for a neutral atom inside\na cavity from 35 ms to 1100 ms. The generic layout of such an experiment is shown in\nFig. 4.4(a). For our purposes, we place the scatterer inside a symmetric Fabry\u2013P\u00e9rot\ncavity of length Lc , which we pump from one side; the dominant field inside the cavity\nis a standing wave field if the reflectivity of the mirrors, r, is high enough. For a numeric\nexample, we use the same cavity properties as Ref. [65]: finesse F = 56 000 modelled\nby using mirrors with t = r + 1 = 1/(1 + 133.5i), cavity length 495 \u03bcm, and mode waist\n30 \u03bcm; we use a wavelength \u03bb = 780 nm. In contrast with Ref. [65], however, let us\nreiterate that our cavity is pumped along its axis.\nWe also take the scatterer to be a two-level atom, with the cavity field detuned 10\u0393\nto the red of the atom transition frequency. Thus, the polarisability of the atom is\n\u03b6 = 4.1 \u00d7 10\u22125 + 4.1 \u00d7 10\u22126 i. The maximum cooling coefficient is found at a detuning\nof \u22122.6 \u03ba from the cavity resonance.

(3.91), on the position of the scatterer, scanned\nover a wavelength, is shown in Fig. 4.4(b). The presence of the cavity manifests itself\nprimarily through a strong enhancement of both the cooling coefficient \u2212F/v and the\nintracavity field intensity. The scattering model explored above is only valid in the limit\nof small saturation. For the\n\n85 Rb\n\nD2 transition, assuming that the beam is circularly\n\npolarised, the saturation intensity is 1.67 mW cm\u22122 [35]. In order to avoid saturation\neffects, we restrict the power input into the cavity to 2 pW; this equates to an intracavity\nintensity of 23 mW cm\u22122 and hence a saturation parameter s = 0.14; this is because s is\ninversely proportional to the square of the detuning, \u221210\u0393 in this case, of the pump beam\nfrom resonance. In turn, this input power also yields a maximum cooling coefficient of\n\n\f122\n\nApplications of transfer matrices\n\nCooling coefficient [in 10\u221211 N/(W m s\u22121 )]\n\n(a)\n\n1.6\n1.4\n1.2\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n-0.2\n-0.4\n-0.6\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nAtom position, x (units of wavelength)\n(b)\n\nFigure 4.5: External cavity cooling.

Therefore, the equilibrium temperature is independent of\nthe pump power in this regime. For the parameters used above, the equilibrium temperature predicted for a scatterer at the point of maximum friction is 56 \u03bcK; averaging the\ncooling coefficient, as well as the diffusion coefficient, over a wavelength, gives a higher\nequilibrium temperature of 220 \u03bcK.\n\n4.2.1.2\n\nExternal cavity cooling: Atom outside the cavity\n\nIn Section 4.1 above, we also proposed [128] that even with the scatterer outside the\ncavity, the cavity's resonance can be exploited to greatly enhance the optomechanical\nfriction experienced by the scatterer vis-\u00e0-vis standard optomechanical cooling setups [8,\n\n\fApplications of transfer matrices\n\n123\n\n23, 139], which place the scatterer in front of a single mirror. It is the aim of this\nsubsection to explore this cooling mechanism, using experimental parameters similar\nto those in the previous subsection, and compare it to the cavity-mediated cooling\nmechanism discussed there.\nOur mathematical model, Fig. 4.5, represents the cavity as a standard, symmetric Fabry\u2013\nP\u00e9rot cavity. However, we emphasise that in principle what is required is simply an\noptical resonance: the cavity in the model can indeed be replaced by whispering gallery\nmode resonators [144] or even solid-state resonators. As a basis for numerical calculations, and to enable direct comparison, we model the same resonator as in the previous\nsubsection. It is important to emphasise that the achievable quality factors of the resonators used for external cavity cooling can intrinsically be made larger than the ones\nin the previous subsection (see, e.g., Ref. [108]) because there does not need to be any\nform of optical or mechanical access inside the resonator itself.\nThe pump beam frequency is again taken to be detuned by 10\u0393 to the red of the atomic\ntransition. By placing the atom outside the cavity, one is free to use high-numericalaperture optics to produce a tighter focus than might be possible in a cavity with\ngood optical and mechanical access. Having a tight focus strengthens the atom\u2013field\ncoupling because of the 1/w2 dependence of \u03b6 on the beam waist w; whereas the friction\nforce scales linearly with the input power, it also scales as \u03b6 2 \u223c 1/w4 [cf. Eq. (3.41)].\nFocussing the beam therefore increases the atom\u2013field coupling more than the local\nintensity. Thus, it is now assumed that the beam is focussed down to 1 \u03bcm, which gives\n\u03b6 = 3.7 \u00d7 10\u22122 + 3.7 \u00d7 10\u22123 i.\nIn order to make a fair comparison between the two cases, we choose to set the saturation\nparameter s = 0.14, as in the previous subsection. The maximum achievable cooling\ncoefficient is then 2.9 \u00d7 10\u221221 N/(m s\u22121 ) for 200 pW of input power, which is an order of\nmagnitude smaller than the previous result and leads to a 1/e velocity cooling time of\n50 \u03bcs and an equilibrium temperature of 280 \u03bcK. The magnitude of the force in this case\nresults from the much smaller pumping beam mode waist and the use of much higher\npowers, subsequently leading to a stronger atom\u2013field interaction. With this beam waist\nand finesse we would be restricted to input powers several orders of magnitude smaller\nif the atom were inside such a cavity.\nIn summary, whereas the friction force inside a cavity is much stronger per unit input\n\n\f124\n\nCooling coefficient [in 10\u221210 N/(W m s\u22121 )]\n\nApplications of transfer matrices\n2.0\n\n\u00d7100 ; 100 \u03bcm\n\u00d7103 ; 10 \u03bcm\n\u00d7105 ; 1 \u03bcm\n\n\u00d7105\n1.5\n\u00d7103\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n-0.5\n-1.0\n-1.5\n-2.0\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nAtom position, x (units of wavelength)\n\nFigure 4.6: Spatial dependence of the friction force acting on an atom inside a cavity with different mode waists (i.e., different polarisabilities) but equal detuning from\nresonance, 10\u0393 to the red.

This is in sharp contrast\nto the case of large polarisability, achieved by an atom at a tight beam focus, as shown\nin Fig. 4.6, or by a micromirror. A scatterer of larger polarisability would experience\nextremely narrow (\u001c \u03bb) peaks in the friction force inside a cavity but not outside it.\nWithin the scattering model used in this section, the atom\u2013cavity coupling can be tuned\nby varying either the beam waist or the laser detuning from atomic resonance. Experimentally, however, atom\u2013cavity coupling is rarely investigated close to resonance, in\norder to minimise the effects of atomic decorehence through spontaneous emission. In\nsuch cases, this coupling can be increased by operating a cavity with a small mode waist;\nthis may in turn be detrimental to the performance of the system due to the strong subwavelength nature of the interaction, as explored in Fig. 4.6.

Eq. (3.41)],\nbut the length scale of the cooling and heating regions is unaffected. (Parameters as in\nSection 4.2.1.2 but with \u2202\u03b6/\u2202k = 0.)\n\nsmaller mode waist is that this not only demands extremely good localisation but also\ntends to decrease the effective cooling coefficient drastically-by up to several orders of\nmagnitude-because of spatial averaging effects.\nIn Section 4.2.1.2, no mention was made of the average friction force acting on the\nscatterer; indeed this average computes to approximately zero for any case involving fardetuned atoms, or other particles with an approximately constant polarisability, outside\ncavities. This, then, also demands strong localisation of the atom; whilst experimentally\nchallenging this disadvantage is somewhat mitigated by the easy mechanical and optical\naccess afforded by external cavity cooling schemes. In Fig. 4.7 it is shown that the\npolarisability of the atom can be varied over a very wide range without affecting the\nlength scale of the cooling and heating regions. The friction force can be seen to vary\nas 1/w4 for a beam waist w; in turn, this originates from the \u03b6 2 scaling of the friction\nforce [cf. Eq. (3.41)].\nIn contrast with the atomic situation, if the scatterer is a micromirror mounted on a\ncantilever, localisation does not present a problem, since such micromirrors naturally\nundergo small oscillations and can be positioned with sub-nm accuracy.\n\n\f126\n\nCooling coefficient [in 10\u221211 N/(W m s\u22121 )]\n\nApplications of transfer matrices\n\n1.0\n\n\u00d710\u22121 ; Lc = 49.5 \u03bcm\n\n\u00d7100 ; Lc = 495.0 \u03bcm \u00d7101 ; Lc = 4950.0 \u03bcm\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n-0.2\n-0.4\n-0.6\n-0.8\n-1.0\n0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5\n\nAtom position, x (units of wavelength)\nFigure 4.8: Spatial dependence of the friction force acting on an atom outside a cavity,\nwith detuning 10\u0393 to the red of resonance.

These parameters can be tuned\nindependently by changing the length of the cavity and the reflectivity of its mirrors.\nThis subsection briefly explores how the two mechanisms we are considering scale with\n\u03ba and F.\nExpressions for the force acting on an atom inside a good cavity are not simple to write\ndown. Nevertheless, in the good-cavity limit one may obtain an analytical formulation\nfor the limiting temperature [19]:\nT =\n\n~\u03ba\n,\nkB\n\n(4.2)\n\ni.e., making a cavity longer decreases the equilibrium temperature proportionately. This\nresult can be justified by observing that whereas the diffusion constant depends only on\nthe intensity inside the cavity (\u221d F), the friction force scales linearly with both the intensity and, if the intensity is kept constant, with the lifetime of the cavity field (\u221d 1/\u03ba).\nThe friction force is therefore proportional to F/\u03ba, and the equilibrium temperature\nproportional to \u03ba.\n\n\f127\n\nApplications of transfer matrices\n\nAs is known from Section 4.1, the friction force (F) acting on an atom outside a cavity\nscales approximately linearly with both the length and the finesse of the cavity. This is\ninterpreted in terms of a 'distance folding' mechanism: the lifetime of the light inside a\n\u0001\ncavity scales inversely with its linewidth \u03ba \u221d 1/ FLC if all other parameters are kept\n\nfixed. Within the range of parameters where the light coupled into the cavity dominates\n\nthe optomechanical effects, this implies that F \u221d 1/\u03ba. One can see this behaviour\nreproduced in Fig. 4.8, where the cooling coefficient acting on an atom outside each of\nthree cavities having different lengths is shown. This mechanism loses its importance if\nthe atomic polarisability is too large, whereby the system behaves more like two coupled\ncavities, or if the cavity is too long. The momentum diffusion affecting the atom outside\na cavity is essentially independent of the length of the properties of a good cavity, since\nit depends on the local intensity surrounding the scatterer. Putting these two results\ntogether, then, gives (Section 4.1)\nT \u2248 1.9\n\n~\u03ba\n,\nkB\n\n(4.3)\n\nin the limiting case of small polarisability and at the point of maximum friction; i.e.,\nthe temperature scales in the same way as for an atom inside the cavity. The numeric\nfactor in the preceding equation depends on \u03b6 and is larger for |\u03b6| \u223c 1.\n\n4.3\n\nAmplified optomechanics in a ring cavity\n\nIn the limit of strong scatterers, friction forces in standing-wave cavities become increasingly position-dependent (cf. Section 4.2), which limits the overall, averaged cooling efficiency. This can be overcome by using ring cavities [83\u201390] where the translational\nsymmetry guarantees position-independent forces. On the other hand, ring cavities are\nusually much larger and of lower Q-factor than their standing-wave counterparts. Using\na gain medium inside a ring cavity has been proposed [91, 92] to offset these losses, allowing one to effectively 'convert' a low-Q cavity into a high-Q one, and thus to increase\nthe effective optomechanical interaction by orders of magnitude. This same concept\nhas also been discussed in theoretical proposals investigating the use of optical parametric amplifiers in standard optomechanical systems [145], or nonlinear media inside\n\n\fApplications of transfer matrices\n\n128\n\ncavities [146] as a tool to control the dynamics of a micromechanical oscillator. A further application of ring cavities is in the investigation of collective atomic recoil lasing\n(CARL) [95], which exploits the spontaneous self-organisation of an atomic ensemble\nwithin a ring cavity, induced by a strong pump beam, to amplify a probe beam through\nDoppler-shifted reflection of the pump. The gain medium is in this case the atomic\nensemble itself.\nLet us now consider a different system that shares several features with the above mechanisms. In particular, we consider a scatterer inside a ring cavity that includes a gain\nmedium, spatially separated from the scatterer. An isolator is also included in the ring\ncavity, in such a way as to prevent the pump beam from circulating in the cavity and\nbeing amplified; this ensures that the intensity of the field surrounding the scatterer is\nalways low and thereby circumvents any problems caused by atomic saturation or mirror\nburning. The Doppler-shifted reflection of the pump from the scatterer is, on the other\nhand, allowed to circulate, and its amplification in turn enhances the velocity-dependent\nforces acting on the scatterer.\nIn such a situation, one is able to take advantage of properties inherent to the ring\ncavity system, such as the fact that the forces acting on the particle do not exhibit any\nsub-wavelength spatial modulation; this is due to the translational symmetry present\nin the system [83]. Moreover, modest amplification allows one to use optical fibres to\nform the ring cavity, opening the door towards increasing the optical length of such\ncavities. It is necessary to have amplification in such cases to compensate for the losses\nintroduced when coupling to a fibre; such losses would otherwise limit the quality factor\nof the cavity. The optomechanical force is, as we will see and in the parameter domain\nof interest, linearly dependent on the cavity length; lengthening the cavity thus provides\nfurther enhancement of the interaction.\nThis section is structured as follows. We shall first introduce the physical model, which\nwe proceed to solve using the transfer matrix method to obtain the friction force and\nmomentum diffusion acting on the particle. In the good-cavity limit, Section 4.3.1.1,\nsimple expressions for these quantities can be obtained, yielding further insight into\nthe system and allowing us to draw some parallels with traditional cavity cooling. In\nthis limit, our model becomes equivalent to one based on a standard master equation\napproach [83] as outlined in Section 4.3.1.2. Realistic numerical values for the various\nparameters are then used in Section 4.3.2 to explore the efficiency and limits of the\n\n\fApplications of transfer matrices\n\n129\n\nFigure 4.9: (a) Physical schematic of a polarisable particle in a unidirectional ring\ncavity, showing the input field B\u0302in .

The work in this section will be published in the J. Mod. Opt. topical\nissue on New cooling mechanisms for atoms and molecules.\n\n4.3.1\n\nGeneral expressions and equilibrium behaviour\n\nThe mathematical model of the ring cavity system, schematically drawn in Fig. 4.9(a),\nis shown in Fig. 4.9(b). A particle, characterised by its polarisability \u03b6, is in a ring\ncavity of round-trip length L. C1,3 are the couplers, between which lies the particle,\nthat terminate the fibre-based cavity, and C2 is the input coupler that injects the pump\nbeam into the cavity. The amplifier, having a gain \u03b3 \u2265 1, is assumed to also function\nas an optical isolator. ri and ti = ri + 1 are the (amplitude) transmission and reflection\ncoefficients of coupler Ci (i = 1, 2, 3). All the \"\u00ca\" modes are noise modes introduced by\nspecific elements. \u000fA , the amplitude of \u00caA introduced into the system, depends on \u03b3;\nsimilarly, \u000f depends on \u03b6. The values of l1 > lA > l2 > l3 > 0 are not important. One of\nthe travelling wave modes of the cavity is pumped by light with wavenumber k0 , but is\nprevented from circulating inside the cavity. This avoids resonant enhancement of the\npumped mode in the cavity and thus avoids saturating the particle. The backscattered\ncounterpropagating mode, on the other hand, is amplified on every round trip by a factor\n\u03b3 by means of the optical amplifier. The TMM is used to self-consistently solve for the\nfour field amplitudes at every point in the cavity in the presence of the pump field and\nthe noise modes introduced by the coupler losses and by the amplifier. Note that in the\nlimit where the amplifier is compensating for the ring cavity losses, the amplifier noise\n\n\f130\n\nApplications of transfer matrices\n\nis also comparable to the loss-induced noise and must therefore be taken into account\nin our model.\nUsing the notation in Fig. 4.9(a) we can relate the expectation values of the amplitudes\nof the two input and two scattered field modes interacting with the particle in a onedimensional scheme, A(k) = h\u00c2(k)i, B(k) = hB\u0302(k)i, C(k) = h\u0108(k)i, and D(k) =\nhD\u0302(k)i, to Bin (k) = hB\u0302in (k)i by means of the relations\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\uf8eb \uf8f6\nC\nA\nB = r2 t3 eik0 l2 Bin , C = \u03b1A , and \uf8ed \uf8f8 = M\u0302 \uf8ed \uf8f8 ,\nD\nB\n\n(4.4)\n\nwhere \u03b1(k) = t1 t2 t3 \u03b3 exp(ikL) is the factor multiplied to the field amplitude every\nround trip. In the preceding equations, as well as in the following, we do not write the\nindex k for simplicity of presentation. The operators \u00c2(k), etc., denote the annihilation\noperators of the various field modes. The three equations Eqs. (4.4) have a readily\napparent physical significance-respectively, they correspond to: the propagation of B\u0302in\nto reach the particle; the feeding back of \u00c2 to \u0108 through the ring cavity; and the usual\ntransfer matrix relation for a particle interacting with the four fields surrounding it. The\nfirst two of these relations are substituted into the third, which subsequently simplifies\nto\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8eb\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\uf8f6\u22121 \uf8eb \uf8f6\n1\n0\n\u03b1 0\n0\n\uf8ed \uf8f8 = \uf8ed\uf8f0\n\uf8fb \u2212 M\u0302 \uf8f0\n\uf8fb\uf8f8 M\u0302 \uf8ed \uf8f8\nBin\n0 r2 t3 eik0 l2\n0 0\nD\nA\n\n\uf8f6\n\n(4.5)\n\nIf we assume far off-resonant operation, i.e., \u2202\u03b6/\u2202k = 0, the velocity-dependent transfer\nmatrix M\u0302 can be written as, cf.

Eq. (4.5) can be inverted in closed form to first order in v/c,\np\nR\nsimilarly to Section 3.2, and can thus be used to find A = 2\u000f0 \u03c3L /(~k0 ) A(k)dk, B =\np\np\np\nR\nR\nR\n2\u000f0 \u03c3L /(~k0 ) B(k)dk, C = 2\u000f0 \u03c3L /(~k0 ) C(k)dk, and D = 2\u000f0 \u03c3L /(~k0 ) D(k)dk,\nwhere the normalisation is with respect to the pump beam mode area \u03c3L and where a\n\nmonochromatic pump is assumed: Bin (k) = B0 \u03b4(k \u2212 k0 ). Here, |A|2 , |B|2 , etc., are\nthe photon currents in units of photons per second.

Section 3.1.1.4), keeping in mind that\n\u0002\n\u0003\nmost of the noise modes, as well as B\u0302in , obey the commutation relation \u00ca(t), \u00ca \u2020 (t0 ) =\n~k0 /(2\u000f0 \u03c3L ) \u03b4(t \u2212 t0 ). The sole exception is the noise introduced by the amplifier, \u00caA , for\n\u0002\n\u2020 0 \u0003\nwhich \u00caA (t), \u00caA\n(t ) = \u2212~k0 /(2\u000f0 \u03c3L ) \u03b4(t \u2212 t0 ); this is due to the model of the amplifier\nas a negative temperature heat-bath, whereby the creation and annihilation operators\n\neffectively switch r\u00f4les. Further discussion of this model can be found in Ref. [37, \u00a77.2].\nAll the noise modes are independent from one another and from B\u0302in , which simplifies\nthe expressions considerably.\n\n\f132\n\nApplications of transfer matrices\n4.3.1.1\n\nThe good-cavity limit as a simplified case\n\nBefore discussing the result of Section 4.3.1, we shall make several approximations to\nobtain a transparent set of equations to briefly explore the equilibrium behaviour of the\nscatterer and to compare with a standard master equation approach. In particular, \u03b6\nis assumed to be real, which is tantamount to assuming that the scatterer suffers no\noptical absorption or, if it is an atom, that it is pumped far off-resonance. Moreover, the\ncavity is assumed to be very good (|t1,2,3 | \u2192 1) and thus no gain medium is introduced\nin the cavity (\u03b3 = 1). With these simplifications, Eq. (4.8) reduces to\n\u001a\n\u001b\n\u0001\n\u03b62\n\u2217 2 \u2202\u03b1\nRe\n1\n\u2212\n\u03b1\nr2 B0\n|1 \u2212 \u03b1|4\n\u2202k\n\u03ba\u2206C\n1\n2\n\u2248 16~k02 \u03b6 2 v\n\u00012 r2 B0 .\n2\n2\n\u03c4\n\u2206C + \u03ba\n\nF \u2248 \u22128~k02 vc\n\n2\n\n(4.10)\n\nIn the preceding equations, \u2206C is the detuning of the pump from cavity resonance, \u03ba is\nthe HWHM cavity linewidth,\n\u03ba=\n\n1 1 \u2212 |t1 t2 t3 |\u03b3\np\n,\n\u03c4\n|t1 t2 t3 |\u03b3\n\n(4.11)\n\nfor |\u03b6| \u001c 1, and \u03c4 = L/c is the round-trip time. Using the same approximations as for\nEq. (4.10), we also obtain the diffusion constant\nD \u2248 8~2 k02 \u03b6 2\n\n1\n\u03ba\n2\nr2 B0 .\n\u22062C + \u03ba2 \u03c4\n\n(4.12)\n\nNote that \u03b3 = 1 here and therefore \u00caA does not contribute to the diffusion constant.\nEqs. (4.10) and (4.12) hold for the case where \u2206C /\u03ba is not too large. The cavity can be\nfully described by means of \u03ba and the finesse F = \u03c0c/(2L\u03ba). Let us now set \u2206C = \u2212\u03ba\nin Eqs. (4.10) and (4.12), whereby\nF = \u2212 \u03c08 ~k02 \u03b6 2 v\n\nF\n2\n2\nr2 B0 , and D = \u03c08 ~2 k02 \u03b6 2 F r2 B0 .\n\u03ba\n\n(4.13)\n\nThese two expressions have a readily-apparent physical significance; at a constant finesse,\ndecreasing the cavity linewidth is equivalent to making the cavity longer, whereupon the\nretardation effects that underlie this cooling mechanism lead to a stronger friction force.\nAt the same time, this has no effect on the intracavity field strength and therefore does\nnot affect the diffusion. On the other hand, improving the cavity finesse by reducing\n\n\f133\n\nApplications of transfer matrices\n\nlosses at the couplers increases the intracavity intensity, thereby increasing both the\nfriction force and the momentum diffusion.\nUsing the above results, we obtain, for \u2206C < 0,\n~\nTA \u2248\nkB\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n|\u2206C |\n\u03ba\n\u03ba\n~\n\u03ba,\n+\n\u2265\n\u03ba\n|\u2206C | 2\nkB\n\n(4.14)\n\nwith the minimum temperature occurring at \u2206C = \u2212\u03ba. One notes that this expression\nis identical to the corresponding one for standard cavity-mediated cooling [19]. Like the\ncorresponding results in Section 3.1.3 and Section 3.1.4, it can be interpreted in a similar\nlight as the Doppler temperature, albeit with the energy dissipation process shifted from\nthe decay of the atomic excited state to the decay of the cavity field.\nA particular feature to note in all the preceding expressions is that they are not spatial\naverages over the position of the particle, but they do not depend on this position\neither. As a result of this, the force, momentum diffusion and equilibrium temperature\ndo not in any way depend on the position of the particle along the cavity field in a 1D\nmodel. The issue of sub-wavelength modulation of the friction force is a major limitation\nof cooling methods based on intracavity standing fields, in particular mirror-mediated\ncooling (Section 3.1.2) and cavity-mediated cooling (Section 4.2).\n\n4.3.1.2\n\nComparison with a semiclassical model\n\nIn the good-cavity limit and without gain our TMM model is equivalent to a standard\nmaster equation approach with the Hamiltonian\n\u0124 = \u2212 ~\u2206a \u03c3\u0302 + \u03c3\u0302 \u2212 \u2212 ~\u2206C \u00e2\u2020C \u00e2C\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\n+ ~g \u00e2\u2020C \u03c3\u0302 \u2212 eik0 x + \u03c3\u0302 + \u00e2C e\u2212ik0 x + ~g a\u2217P \u03c3\u0302 \u2212 e\u2212ik0 x + \u03c3\u0302 + aP eik0 x ,\n\n(4.15)\n\nand the Liouvillian terms\n\u0001\n\u0001\nL\u03c1\u0302 = \u2212\u0393 \u03c3\u0302 + \u03c3\u0302 \u2212 \u03c1\u0302 \u2212 2\u03c3\u0302 \u2212 \u03c1\u0302\u03c3\u0302 + + \u03c1\u0302\u03c3\u0302 + \u03c3\u0302 \u2212 \u2212 \u03ba \u00e2\u2020C \u00e2C \u03c1\u0302 \u2212 2\u00e2C \u03c1\u0302\u00e2\u2020C + \u03c1\u0302\u00e2\u2020C \u00e2C ,\n\n(4.16)\n\nas adapted from Ref.

(4.10), thus confirming our TMM results by a more standard technique.\nThe advantage of the TMM approach lies in the simplicity and generality of expressions\nsuch as Eq.

As shown above, the momentum diffusion coefficient is easily calculated\nfrom the TMM.\n\n4.3.2\n\nNumerical results and discussion\n\nWe can use the conversion factor |B0 |2 = P/(~k0 c), where P is the power of the input beam, to evaluate the above equations numerically in a physically meaningful way.\nSpecifically, the particle is now assumed to be a (two\u2013level)\n\n85 Rb\n\natom, pumped \u221210\u0393\n\nfrom D2 resonance, where \u0393 = 2\u03c0 \u00d7 3.03 MHz is the HWHM linewidth of this same\ntransition at a wavelength of ca. 780 nm; because the detuning is much larger than the\nlinewidth, we simplify the calculations by setting \u2202\u03b6/\u2202\u03c9 = 0.

The Doppler temperature for 85 Rb is also indicated. The\nhorizontal axis differs from that in Fig. 4.10 mainly because the temperature is only\nwell-defined for regions where the friction force promotes cooling. (Parameters are as\nin Fig. 4.10.)\n\nthe power is reduced by a factor of 1/|t1 t2 t3 |2 = 4.04 with each round-trip, in the presence of no gain in the amplifier. We shall compare this case to the low-gain case; the gain\nof the amplifier we consider is constrained to be small enough that |\u03b1|2 = |t1 t2 t3 \u03b3|2 < 1.\nUnder these conditions, there is no exponential build-up of intensity inside the cavity\nand the system is stable. A cavity with a large enough gain that |\u03b1|2 > 1 would effectively be a laser cavity. Such a system would have no stable state in our model, since\nwe assume that the gain medium is not depleted, and will therefore not be considered\nfurther in the following.\nFig. 4.10 shows the friction force acting on the particle, and Fig. 4.11 the equilibrium\ntemperature, as the length of the cavity is tuned on the scale of one wavelength. In\neach of these two figures two cases are shown, one representing no gain in the amplifier\n(\u03b3 = 1) and one representing a low-gain amplifier (\u03b3 = 1.75); note that in both cases\nthe condition |\u03b1|2 < 1 is satisfied.\nIn order to provide a fair comparison between these two cases, we choose the pump\namplitude Bin such that the saturation of the particle is the same in the two cases. This\nensures that any difference in cooling performance is not due to a simple increase in intensity. Since the TMM as presented here is based on a linear model of the particle, our\nresults presented above are only valid in the limit of saturation parameter much smaller\n\n\fApplications of transfer matrices\n\n136\n\nthan 1. Thus, as a basis for the numerical comparisons between the two different cases,\nwe choose to set the saturation parameter to 0.1. Fig. 4.10 shows that under these conditions the amplified system leads to a significant, approximately 25-fold, enhancement\nof the maximum friction force. This can therefore be attributed unambiguously to the\neffective enhancement of the cavity Q-factor by the amplifier.\nHowever, for the parameters considered here, in particular for small particle polarisability \u03b6 and for |\u03b1|2 < 1, the counterpropagating mode intensity is much smaller than that\nof the pumped mode, even if the former is amplified. Thus, the intracavity field is always\ndominated by the pump beam, whereas the friction force is mostly dependent on the\nDoppler-shifted reflection of the pump from the particle. Specifically, for the parameters\nused above we find that the total field intensity changes by less than 1% when the gain\nis increased from 1 to 1.75. Hence, similar results to those of Fig. 4.10 are obtained even\nwithout pump normalisation.\nThe steady-state temperature, obtained by the ratio of diffusion and friction, is shown in\nFig. 4.11 for the same parameters as above. We observe that the broader resonance in the\nfriction as a function of cavity detuning (i.e., of cavity length), shown in Fig. 4.10, also\nleads to a wider range of lower temperatures compared to the amplified case. However,\nas expected, within the narrower resonance of the amplified system where the friction\nis significantly enhanced, the stationary temperature is also significantly reduced. We\nsee that while the maximum friction force is increased by a factor of 25.4, the lowest\nachievable temperature is decreased by a factor of 19.9 when switching from \u03b3 = 1 to\n\u03b3 = 1.75. While the overall cavity intensity is dominated by the pump field, and is\ntherefore hardly affected by the amplifier, the diffusion is actually dominated by the\ninteraction of the weak counterpropagating field with the pump field. This can be seen\nmost clearly by the strong detuning dependence of the analytical expression for D in\nthe good-cavity limit, Eq. (4.12). As a consequence, the lowest achievable temperature\nis improved by a slightly smaller factor than the maximum cooling coefficient. This is\nconsistent with the idea that the amplifier not only increases the cavity lifetime, but\nalso adds a small amount of additional noise into the system. Nevertheless, a strong\nenhancement of the cooling efficiency is observed in the presence of the amplifier.\n\n\fChapter 5\n\nThree-dimensional scattering\nwith an optical memory\nHomogeneal Rays which flow from several Points of any Object, and fall almost\nPerpendicularly on any reflecting or refracting Plane or Spherical Surface, shall\nafterwards diverge from so many other Points, or be Parallel to so many other Lines,\nor converge to so many other Points, either accurately or without any sensible Error.\nAnd the same thing will happen, if the Rays be reflected or refracted successively\nby two or three or more Plane or spherical Surfaces.\n[...]\nWherever the Rays which come from all the Points of any Object meet again in\nso many Points after they have been made to converge by Reflexion or Refraction,\nthere they will make a Picture of the Object upon any white Body on which they\nfall.\nI. Newton, Opticks (1704)\n\nThe scattering theory presented in the previous chapters can be used to describe a\nwide variety of one-dimensional, or quasi-one-dimensional, situations involving mobile\nscatterers and immobile optics. The three-dimensional nature of the electromagnetic\nfield can, however, be exploited to give rise to a different type of retarded dipole-dipole\ninteraction, one mediated not only by the relative phase difference between the successive\nreflections but also the spreading nature of spherical waves in three dimensions.\nI start this chapter with an extension of a self-consistent scattering theory that was used\nto describe optical binding phenomena [147]. Our treatment essentially identifies the\ntwo particles described in Ref. [147] such that the 'binding' that takes place really is\n\n137\n\n\f138\n\nThree-dimensional scattering with an optical memory\n\nFigure 5.1: Polarised by incident radiation E 0 (t, r), a particle moving with velocity v\nis bound to its retarded reflection in a surface, characterised by round-trip time \u03c4 and\nfield propagator g.\n\nbetween a particle and itself, as mediated by a mirror or other delay element. After\ndescribing this extension to the theory in Section 5.1, I shall apply it to the mirrormediated cooling described earlier in this work, both in one dimension (cf. Section 5.2)\nand in three (Section 5.3). I will use these results in Chapter 7 to discuss experimentallyaccessible configurations for exploring the various mechanisms described in this thesis.\n\n5.1\n\nOptical self-binding of Rayleigh particles\n\nThe work in this section is being prepared for publication by James Bateman, AX, and\nTim Freegarde. Its basis originated from TF and was subsequently elaborated upon by\nall three authors. The Mathematica code used to solve the equations and verify the\nsolutions was written largely by JB.\nWe first analyse the retarded classical electrostatic interaction between the induced\ndipoles of a particle, moving along a path r(t), and its reflection, as shown in Fig. 5.1,\nfollowing the ideas set forth in Ref. [147]. The unperturbed illuminating field is denoted\nE 0 (t, r). A tensor propagator, g, is used to describe the propagation of the scattered field\nfrom the particle and back to itself through reflection in the mirror. In one dimension,\ng(t, r) = \u2212iei\u03c9\u03c4 (t,r) 1 ,\n\n(5.1)\n\nwhere the pre-factor \u2212i accounts for the phase shift upon reflection as well as the Gouy\nphase shift: in our 1D model we take the particle to be a point-like dipole at the focus\n\n\fThree-dimensional scattering with an optical memory\n\n139\n\nof a tightly-focussed beam of mode area \u03c3L .

(5.2) is the tensor Green's function for\nfree-space propagation [148, 149] of an electromagnetic wave, normalised to render it\ndimensionless.\nThe interaction of the particle with the electric field is assumed to be through the\ndipole interaction, whereby the particle is described by means of its polarisability \u03c7;\nthis polarisability allows us to define a dimensionless polarisability\n\u03b6 = \u03c7k/(2\u03c3L ) ,\n\n(5.3)\n\nas before. The form for \u03b6 we choose is identical for both one- and three-dimensional\ncases, despite arising from different considerations; in one dimension \u03b6 is defined in\nSection 1.6, whereas in three dimensions we define \u03b6 through a particular grouping of\nconstants to yield dimensionless \u03b6 and g. In this chapter we will, for simplicity, assume\na real, scalar value for \u03c7. The resulting equations can be subsequently generalised for\ncomplex, vector or tensor polarisabilities. Multiple scattering between the particle and\nthe mirror is taken into account self-consistently by solving for the total electric field\nE[t, r(t)], experienced by the particle at position r(t) and time t:\nE = E 0 + \u03b6g * E ,\n\n(5.4)\n\nwhere all the terms are evaluated at [t, r(t)]. The solution of this equation can be given\nanalytically to lowest order in v and \u03c4 , and for the case when (1 \u2212 \u03b6g) is invertible (i.e.,\n\n\fThree-dimensional scattering with an optical memory\n\n140\n\nwhen k\u03b6gk \u001c 1) [147],\n\uf8eb\n\nEx\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7 h\n\uf8ec\ni\n\u0001\u22121 0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n*E ,\nE = \uf8ec Ey \uf8f7 = 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b6g)\u22121 * \u03c4 \u03b6g * Dt 1 \u2212 \u03b6g\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\nEz\n\n(5.5)\n\nwhere Dt = \u2202t + v * \u2207 is the total time derivative. All the terms in the preceding two\nequations are evaluated in a frame rotating with the angular frequency \u03c9, in order to\nremove the fast time variation, at [t, r(t)]. The non-retarded result of Ref. [147], applied\nto the particle and its reflection, is thus modified by the appearance of an additional,\ntime- and velocity-dependent, term. The dipole force experienced by the particle may\nbe obtained as in Ref. [147]:\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8fc\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f2 X\n\uf8fd\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nF = \uf8ec Fy \uf8f7 ; where Fi = 12 \u000f0 Re \u03c7\nEj \u2202i Ej\u2217 ,\n\uf8f3\n\uf8fe\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\nj\nFz\nFx\n\n(5.6)\n\nwith i, j separately representing the three spatial dimensions x, y, z. A series expansion\nin powers of k\u03b6gk reveals the leading terms for a stationary particle to be the dipole\nforce from the unperturbed field, and then the dipole force upon the polarised particle\ndue to the field propagated from the induced polarisation.\n\n5.2\n\nMirror-mediated cooling in one dimension\n\nFor a one-dimensional geometry with the particle a distance x from a perfect mirror,\nthe incident illumination combines with its reflection to give an electric field E 0 (x) =\nE0 \u0177 sin(kx), and \u03c4 = 2x/c; \u0177 is a unit vector in the y direction. The force in the x\ndirection upon the moving particle is therefore\n\u001a\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03c7k \u0010\nv\u0011 2\n1\n2\n1\u2212\nsin (kx) 4 cos2 (kx) \u2212 1\nFx = \u000f0 \u03c7kE0 sin(2kx) +\n4\n\u03c3L\nc\n\u001b\n2\n\u03c7k \u03c4 v\n\u2212\nsin(4kx) .\n\u03c3L\n\n(5.7)\n\nThe force thus comprises three terms. The first two are the dipole force exerted by the\nunperturbed field, and a Doppler-shifted optical binding force between the particle and\n\n\fThree-dimensional scattering with an optical memory\n\n(a) Laboratory frame\n\n141\n\n(b) Particle frame\n\nFigure 5.2: Retarded binding of a normally-illuminated particle, moving with velocity\nv, to its own reflection, depicted (a) in the laboratory frame, in which the image lags\nbehind; (b) in the rest frame of particle, whereby the 'wake' trails behind.\n\nits reflection: the Doppler shift here changes the wavelengths of the Fourier field components and hence the gradient of the field formed by their superposition. The third term,\nwhich depends upon the particle velocity, the electric field propagator and the round-trip\nretardation time, is the velocity-dependent force, and dominates the velocity-dependent\npart of the second term when the distance from the mirror is many wavelengths. When\nthe sign of this component is such as to oppose the particle velocity, cooling ensues. This\nthird term is qualitatively and quantitatively identical to the equivalent terms derived\nfrom a semiclassical approach (Section 2.6.2.2) and using a one-dimensional scattering\ntheory (Section 3.1.3).\n\n5.3\n\nSelf-binding: mirror-mediated cooling in three dimensions\n\nWhen a particle or ensemble is strongly coupled to its reflection, we must consider\nhigher-order terms in the expansion of Eq. (5.5), such as the interaction between the\npropagated particle polarisation and the further polarisation which that induces. This\ncorresponds to the optical binding [150, 151] of the particle to its reflection, due to the\ntweezing of the particle by light that it has focussed, as shown in Fig. 5.2(a). The finite\ntime taken for light from the particle to return via the mirror causes the reflected image\nto trail behind the moving particle, providing a component of the binding force in the\ndirection of the particle velocity and therefore a transverse force even when the geometry\nshows translational symmetry. Fig. 5.2(b) shows the same geometry in the frame of the\nparticle: it is now the inclination of the transformed incident illumination that causes\nthe focussed 'wake' again to lie behind the particle. The sign of the frictional component\n\n\f142\n\nThree-dimensional scattering with an optical memory\n\nagain alternates with distance from the mirror, but it does so asymmetrically because\nthe apparent field strength described by Eq. (5.5) is also modulated. The result is a\nnon-zero force, when averaging over the x coordinate,\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n* Fx +\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\u000f0 E 2 k 2 \u03c72\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec Fy \uf8f7 = (\u2212v) 0\n128\u03c0cx2\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\nFz\n\n\uf8eb\n\n1\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8ec 3 \uf8f7,\n\uf8ed \uf8f8\n3\n\n(5.8)\n\nunder circularly-polarised illumination and taking into account the near-field effects in\ng. This force becomes comparable with the amplitude of the position-dependent force\nwhen x . \u03bb, and could therefore be particularly significant for refractive nanoparticles\nin, for example, colloidal photonic crystals.\n\n\fPart III\n\nExperimental Work\n\n143\n\n\fChapter 6\n\nExperimental setup\nEach piece, or part, of the whole nature is always an approximation to the complete\ntruth, or the complete truth so far as we know it. In fact, everything we know is\nonly some kind of approximation, because we know that we do not know all the\nlaws as yet. Therefore, things must be learned only to be unlearned again or, more\nlikely, to be corrected. [...] The test of all knowledge is experiment. Experiment is\nthe sole judge of scientific \"truth\".\nR. Feynman, The Feynman Lectures on Physics (1964)\n\nThe mechanisms described in the previous chapters, especially mirror-mediated cooling\nand external cavity cooling, present several exciting avenues not only for theoretical, but\nalso for experimental, research. This chapter presents an overview of the vacuum and\nlaser systems employed by our group in our ongoing investigations into these mechanisms\nand into MOT miniaturisation and atomic trap arrays. In the first section I describe\nthe physical makeup of the vacuum and laser systems; the second section describes the\nnovel trap geometry and imaging process employed in our system.\n\n6.1\n\nVacuum and laser system\n\nThe aim of the current experiment is to investigate atom\u2013surface interactions. A 'clean'\ncloud of ultracold\n\n85 Rb\n\natoms in a magneto-optical trap was chosen as the starting\n\npoint for these investigations. In designing the experiment, the apparatus had to satisfy\na number of criteria, chiefly:\n\n144\n\n\fExperimental setup\n\n145\n\n\u2022 the cold atom cloud needs to be formed close to a surface and the vacuum chamber\nwindows;\n\u2022 the surface, or 'sample', may be simply plane or structured on the micro- or nanoscale;\n\u2022 rapid (on the order of one or two weeks) turnaround time for changing the sample;\nand\n\u2022 very good optical access.\nLet us look at each of these criteria in turn to explore the design choices they impose\non the system.\n\n6.1.1\n\nAtom cloud close to surface\n\nThe mirror magneto-optical trap [152] (mirror MOT) was devised as a way to obtain\ncold atom samples close to a surface. In the present context, however, the standard\nmirror MOT has a number of disadvantages: the plane of the mirror lies obliquely to\nthe coils that generate the magnetic field necessary to form the MOT, and the beam\nthat forms the MOT illuminates a large cross-section of the mirror directly below the\natom cloud-the former will be discussed below in the context of optical access, whereas\nthe latter can be solved by using what we term the '\u039bMOT' beam geometry, as will be\ndiscussed in Section 6.2.\n\n6.1.2\n\nStructured surface\n\nThe interaction between atoms and plane surfaces has been investigated both in the\ncontext of near field [153] and far field effects [103]. The use of structured surfaces\nallows the coupling of fluorescence from the atom to surface plasmons. A number of\nadvances by Bartlett and co-workers [154, 155] over the past decade have permitted\nthe rapid production of two-dimensional arrays of hemispherical dimples, with radii of\n0.1\u2013100 \u03bcm, on gold surfaces and with extremely small surface roughness. This process\nis illustrated schematically in Fig. 6.1; the result is an array of dimples in a small area\nof an otherwise plane mirror.\nThe initial characterisation of the system in the Southampton Laboratory was conducted\n\n\fExperimental setup\n\n146\n\nFigure 6.1: Templating process used to make the structured surfaces. (a) A colloidal\nsuspension of latex spheres in water is allowed to evaporate on a gold substrate within\na masked region. (b) An ordered, close-packed monolayer of spheres is formed on the\nsubstrate. (c) Gold is electrodeposited and grows from the substrate upwards, around\nthe latex spheres. (d) The spheres and mask are removed by using conventional solvents.\n\nFigure 6.2: First sample used in the vacuum chamber, pictured being secured into\nthe holder. This sample consisted of a microscope slide onto which a layer of gold was\nevaporated.\n\nusing a plane mirror sample, Fig. 6.2. This sample was then replaced by one templated\nwith 100 \u03bcm hemispherical dimples, Fig. 6.3.\n\n6.1.3\n\nRapid changing of surface\n\nThe physical mechanisms behind the dominant interaction between the atom and the\nsurface depend on the length scale of the structure present on the surface. In the case of\na plane sample, the dominant interaction is the Casimir\u2013Polder force in the extreme near\nfield [156, 157] and the retarded dipole force in the extreme far field (see Section 2.6; see\nalso Ref. [158]). For a surface with hemispherical dimples having radii of the order of the\nwavelength, plasmonic effects [159] are expected to dominate. For larger dimples, say\nthose with radii of 10 \u03bcm or greater, the system is approximated better by geometrical\noptics and one expects the formation of a dipole trap at the focus of each hemisphere. In\nthis regime, one can also envisage depositing magnetically polarised films on the surface\n\n\fExperimental setup\n\n147\n\nFigure 6.3: Second sample used, mounted on the vacuum-compatible translation\nstage. This sample was templated with hemispherical concave mirrors; the bright dot\nin the mirror is the reflection of light off the hemispheres.\n\nthat would allow the formation of a microscopic MOT at the focus of each dimple.\nFor these reasons, it is important to be able to switch samples, in order to vary the\nlength scale of the structure, rapidly. This imposes restrictions on the size of the vacuum\nchamber used: it must be as small as possible without hindering optical access.\n\n6.1.4\n\nGood optical access\n\nA good compromise for a vacuum chamber that satisfies the above restrictions was found\nin the Kimball Physics Spherical Octagon (part number MCF600-SO200800) chamber,\nshown in Fig. 6.4. The two large ports and large aspect ratio enable the use of high\nnumerical aperture fluorescence collection optics. The sample close to which the MOT\nis formed is placed in the centre of the chamber with its plane parallel to the large ports.\nThis in turn allows the use of a purpose-built high-magnification microscope objective\n(spatial resolution: ca. 2 \u03bcm) to be used with its focal plane coincident with the sample.\nTwo of the smaller ports on the chamber are used for the mount holding the sample\nand for connecting the chamber to the ion pump and 85 Rb dispensers. The other six are\ntherefore left free, allowing almost unrestricted optical access to the cold atom cloud.\n\n\fExperimental setup\n\n148\n\nFigure 6.4: Technical drawing for the Kimball Physics MCF600-SO200800 spherical octagon.

In particular, we are able to trap atoms\nclose to optically scattering surfaces and to image them with an excellent signal-to-noise\nratio. We also demonstrate a simple magneto\u2013optical atom cloud launching method.\nWe anticipate that this system will be useful for a range of experimental studies of novel\natom-surface interactions and atom trap miniaturisation.\n\n6.2.1\n\nIntroduction and motivation\n\nOver the past two decades, several configurations for magneto\u2013optical traps have been\ndemonstrated [163\u2013167]. The starting point for most geometries has been the original,\n'6-beam', configuration [163], where the atom trap is created in the intersection of three\ncounterpropagating laser beams. Despite it having the advantage that the atoms can\nbe trapped far from any surface, thereby reducing spurious scatter in the imaging of\nsuch a trap, one cannot easily use this configuration for investigations into atom\u2013surface\ninteractions, for precisely the same reason. Another, more recent, configuration is the\nso-called 'mirror MOT' [167], where the trap is formed a short distance away from a\nmirror, which also serves to reduce the number of necessary incident laser beam paths\nto two. The major drawback of such a configuration is its reduced optical access, due\nto the oblique angle of the field coils with respect to the mirror. The presence of\na reflecting surface close to the trap also presents a problem of an entirely different\nnature. If the object of one's investigation is to observe the interaction between atoms\nand surfaces structured at the micrometre scale, for example hemispherical mirrors of\nthe type investigated in [159], the signal from the atoms will almost certainly be lost\ndue to unwanted scattering of light into the optical system. MOTs on the meso- and\nmicroscopic scale, in particular, have received some recent interest [168], but the small\natom numbers in such traps have so far hindered their imaging and characterisation [169].\nIn this section we detail a modified configuration that we call the '\u039bMOT' and implement\nan imaging system based on a two-stage excitation process [170], which help us overcome\neach of these limitations and aid our exploration of different atom\u2013surface interactions.\n\n\fExperimental setup\n\n150\n\nFigure 6.5: Schematic of one of the two beam paths involved in our MOT geometry.\nS is the incoming beam; A, B, and C are mirrors. The component marked '\u03bb/4' is a\nquarter-wave plate. The cold atom cloud forms in the intersection region, O. In this\ndiagram we do not show a second, identical, beam, which provides trapping and cooling\nforces in the plane normal to the paper. The area of mirror A immediately adjacent to\nthe trapped atoms is not illuminated, and can therefore be patterned or structured to\nexplore atom\u2013surface interactions. Inset: The lower surface of mirror A, showing the\nMOT beams and the sample area, which is not illuminated by any of the beams.\n\nThis section is structured as follows. The next subsection is devoted to the description\nand characterisation of our trap geometry. We then discuss the mechanism behind our\nmultilevel imaging system and show how it does indeed allow for practically backgroundfree imaging of the atom trap. The subsequent subsection discusses surface loading by\nmagneto-optic launching, which allows us to load atoms onto a surface with a threedimensional range of motion.\n\n6.2.2\n6.2.2.1\n\nThe \u039bMOT\nDescription\n\nA single beam of circularly polarised light of the right helicity is split using a nonpolarising beamsplitter, to generate the two beams that produce the trap, and a halfwave plate is inserted in one of the two resulting beams to achieve the correct polarisations. Each of these beams, denoted S, is then used to construct the geometry shown in\nFig. 6.5. Mirror C is set up so as to retroreflect the beam. Mirrors B and C, together\nwith the quarter-wave plate, allow us to change the polarisation in the retroreflected\nbranch independently of the incoming polarisation. In a normal mirror MOT, the polarisations cannot be modified independently of each other and the quadrupole axis has\n\n\fExperimental setup\n\n151\n\nFigure 6.6: Image of our MOT in operation, corresponding to Fig. 6.5; mirror A is\nindicated in the picture.\n\nto be at an oblique angle to the mirror. The four beams travelling towards O thus have\nthe correct polarisations to produce the trapping and cooling forces necessary to form a\nMOT in this plane. Combined with the second set of beams, this means that the MOT\nis formed in the intersection region of four pairs of counterpropagating beams. We note\nthat alignment of mirror B such that the beam is retroreflected perfectly will recover\nthe traditional mirror MOT beam geometry, albeit with the incorrect polarisations for\na MOT cloud to form.\nSeveral advantages are apparent in the use of this geometry. The trapping volume is\nthe entire overlap of the trapping beams, unlike that in a mirror MOT where half the\ntrapping volume is rendered inaccessible by the presence of the mirror. Optical access\nis also much improved, both because the coils are oriented in such a way as to be less\nobstructive, and because we have removed the necessity of having a beam travelling in a\nplane parallel to mirror A. This allows us to use as much of the 360\u00b0 viewing angle in that\nplane as is necessary for imaging or manipulation beams. If this is not a requirement,\na simpler set-up can alternatively be used, where only one set of beams is used in the\ndouble-'\u039b' geometry, the trapping and cooling forces in the plane normal to the paper\nin Fig. 6.5 being produced by means of a separate pair of counterpropagating beams.\nAn important advantage of this geometry is that the double-'\u039b' shape of the MOT\nbeams affords better imaging of the trap, allowing microscope objectives to be mounted\nvery close to it. With a custom-made objective, we can achieve high-NA imaging (NA >\n\n\f152\n\nExperimental setup\n\n0.5) and a diffraction-limited resolution of < 2 \u03bcm. While a similar degree of optical\naccess may be possible in the traditional 6-beam configuration, we note that this latter\nconfiguration is unsuitable for atom\u2013surface interaction studies. In contrast, mirror A in\nour geometry can be replaced by any other suitable reflecting surface. One candidate for\nsuch a reflecting surface would be one of the surfaces of a Dove prism, which could then\nbe used to form a two-dimensional bichromatic evanescent-field trap [171] close to the\nmirror surface. This trap would be loaded from the MOT cloud using such techniques\nas magneto-optic launching, which is explained in Section 6.2.4.\nAside from this marked increase in optical access, our system is simple to set up and\noperate. In particular, it requires fewer beam paths than a traditional MOT (two rather\nthan three) and alignment of the beams is also easy: a CCD camera looking up at the\nmirror can be used to align the beams coarsely; once this is done, optimisation of the\ncold atom signal provides the fine-tuning of the alignment.\n\n6.2.2.2\n\nCharacterisation\n\nA typical trap, shown in Fig. 6.6, is ellipsoidal in shape with a 1/e diameter of the order\nof 400 \u03bcm along its minor axes and contains around 4 \u00d7 104\n\n85 Rb\n\natoms. Combined\n\nwith a measured trap lifetime \u03c40 \u2248 6 s, this allows us to infer the trap loading rate,\n\nN0 /\u03c40 \u2248 6.7 \u00d7 103 s\u22121 . We measured a cloud temperature of 110 \u00b1 40 \u03bcK, the large\n\nuncertainty being due to the imprecision in measuring the cloud size.\nTypical parameters for the operation of our trap are: a detuning of \u221214.9 MHz, or\n\u22125.0 \u0393 (\u0393 \u2248 3.0 MHz [172]), for the cooling laser and a power of 6 mW divided between\nthe two trapping beams (beam diameter: 6 mm). The minimum power necessary to\nproduce the MOT was found to be \u2248 1.3 mW in each of the two beams. The trap was\nloaded from background gas of a natural isotopic mixture of rubidium at a pressure of\n10\u22129 mbar. The cooling and repump lasers were locked using the DAVLL technique [173]\nfor long-term stability and flexibility of operation.\n\n6.2.3\n\nMultilevel imaging system\n\nThe most common method of imaging a cold atom cloud in a MOT is fluorescence\nimaging. When the cloud is close to a reflecting surface both the cloud and its reflections\n\n\f153\n\nExperimental setup\n\nFigure 6.7: The four-level system in 85 Rb that we use to image our atoms. The\nMOT lasers (780 nm) and a laser at 776 nm are used to induce a ladder transition.\nThe population decays back to the ground state, via an intermediate state, and emits\na 420 nm photon in the process. The hyperfine splitting of the excited states is not\ndrawn for clarity.\n\nwill be seen by the imaging system (see Ref. [152], for example). This situation is\nexacerbated by the presence of surfaces that reflect unwanted light into the imaging\noptics and thereby decreasing the signal-to-noise ratio of the imaging system. Fig. 6.6,\nshows an example of the mirror in our system scattering the MOT beams into the\nimaging system.\nThis problem may be overcome using two-stage excitation imaging. We make use of a\nfour-level system in\n\n85 Rb\n\n(see Fig. 6.7 for details), similarly to Refs. [174] and [175];\n\natoms in the 5S1/2 ground state are pumped to the 5D5/2 state via 780 nm and 776 nm\nradiation, the former being provided by one of the MOT beams, and then decay back to\nthe ground state via an intermediate 6P3/2 state, emitting 420 nm radiation, which we\ndetect. We note that a very similar system was recently used to produce a multiphoton\nMOT [176]. In our system, this process gives a significantly smaller signal than can\nbe obtained through 780 nm fluorescence imaging. However, it has the benefit of being\nentirely background-free: in a well-shielded system, the entire 420 nm signal reaching\nthe detector has its origin in the cold atom cloud. Off-the-shelf filters can then be used\nto remove the 780 nm radiation reaching the detector.\n\nGeneration of the 776 nm beam\nThe 776 nm beam is produced using a Sanyo DL7140-201S diode and the same external\ncavity diode laser design used to produce the MOT cooling and trapping beams.

To obtain these data, we\nremoved the quarter-wave plates on either end of the vapour cell, thus having linearly\npolarised light entering the cell from both ends.\n85 Rb\n\nhas no spectral features in this wavelength range that are suitable for locking the\n\nlaser frequency, a multilevel locking system is used (see Fig. 6.8). 5 mW from each of\nthe MOT cooling and repump beams (\u2248 780 nm) and 1.5 mW from the 776 nm beam,\nall rendered circularly polarised by the quarter-wave plates, enter the heated vapour cell\n(VC) from opposite ends. A large-area UV-enhanced filtered silicon photodiode (PD),\noperating in photovoltaic mode, picks up the resulting Doppler-free fluorescence and is\namplified by means of a LMP7721 amplifier chip. Magnetic coils surrounding the heated\nvapour cell control the Zeeman shift of the magnetic sublevels of the atoms inside the\ncell, shifting this signal, and therefore the lock point, as required. Around 4 mW of\nthe 776 nm beam is then mixed in with the MOT cooling and repump beams and sent\nthrough an optical fibre to the MOT.\nWe show a sample 420 nm signal, as detected at the photodiode, in Fig. 6.9, where the\nhyperfine splitting of the 5D5/2 level in 85 Rb is evident in the shoulders on the right-hand\nside of the peak in the figure.

Depending\non the parameters chosen, the spectra corresponding to the latter figure may exhibit two\nwell-resolved peaks due to the Autler\u2013Townes splitting [177]; in the spectrum shown in\nFig. 6.10, however, the presence of the second peak manifests itself as a slight shoulder\non the photodiode signal.

Several methods have been devised for moving cold atom clouds, including the use of push beams [178]\nand moving magnetic coils [179]. Push beams are easy to set up, requiring either the\naddition of one extra beam or the switching off of one of the counterpropagating beams,\nbut cannot be used to push atom clouds towards highly reflective surfaces. Using moving\nmagnetic coils requires a rather involved mechanical setup.\nWe make use of a third method, which we call magneto-optic launching, for transport of\nthe atom cloud by rapidly moving the trap centre and then releasing the cloud, thereby\nimparting momentum to it. An auxiliary coil is added to the system in Fig. 6.5, above\nthe upper MOT coil. After the MOT cloud forms, a long current pulse is applied to this\nauxiliary coil, which launches the cloud upward with a speed determined by the size and\nduration of the current pulse, and then the cloud is released from the trap by switching\noff the MOT beams after 20 ms. Fig. 6.11 shows a series of photographs of the cloud\nafter being launched by a magnetic pulse. It can be seen that the pulse results in an\napproximately uniform vertical cloud speed of 0.063 m s\u22121 . The physical orientation of\nour system, with the mirror and sample being above the trapping region, allows us to\nlaunch the cloud upwards with a much greater degree of control than would be possible\nif the cloud were merely dropped downwards.\nFinally, we note that the equilibrium distance of the MOT cloud from the mirror surface\ndepends on the beam diameter and the size of the 'sample area', i.e., the section of the\nmirror that acts as a sample and is not usable as a plane mirror. With a sample area\ndiameter of 2 mm and beam diameter of 4 mm, the cloud can be made to form less than\n4 mm away from the surface, allowing us to use the magneto-optic launching method to\nmove the atoms closer to the surface for interaction studies.\n\n\fChapter 7\n\nA guide for future experiments\n[...] [I]t is more important to have beauty in one's equations than to have them fit\nexperiment.\nP. A. M. Dirac, Scientific American 208, 5 (1963)\n\nThis chapter aims to provide a guide for experimentalists seeking to observe the effects we\npredicted in earlier chapters. Section 7.1 presents an overview of the different geometries\nexplored in the previous chapters. For each of these geometries, Section 7.2 calculates\nand compares the relevant friction forces acting on the particle. Section 7.3 discusses\na number of experimentally-accessible configurations and calculates cooling times and\nequilibrium temperatures that can be expected in each situation. The first appendix to\nthis chapter is a technical note discussing electric fields inside dielectrics and the origin\nof the Clausius\u2013Mossotti equation that describes the response of a bulk dielectric to an\napplied electric field. Finally, two appendices then follow that discuss, respectively, some\nproblems encountered when calculating electric fields inside microscopic hemispherical\nmirrors, and general expressions for the force acting on an atom inside an arbitrary\nmonochromatic field, ignoring delay effects.\n\n7.1\n\nOverview of several different possibilities\n\nIt has been outlined in the preceding chapters that several different geometries exist that\nallow a memory. Moreover, within each such geometry, one can choose to investigate\ncooling mechanisms on different classes of particle. The aim of this section is to briefly\n157\n\n\fA guide for future experiments\n\n158\n\nsummarise these different possibilities, noting the advantages and disadvantages of each:\nSection 7.1.1 to Section 7.1.4 look at species that can be cooled, and Section 7.1.5 to\nSection 7.1.9 at the geometries themselves.\n\n7.1.1\n\nTrapped ions\n\nIons can be trapped in radio-frequency traps, and laser cooled down to the ground vibrational state of such traps,1 with remarkable ease. The lifetime of trapped ions can be of\nthe order of hours [180], which is orders of magnitude longer than the comparable figure\nfor neutral atoms. For these reasons, ions would make ideal test subjects for exploring\nforces that vary significantly over length scales of the order of a wavelength [103, 181].\nInterest in using trapped ions also arises from their potential applications in quantum\ninformation storage and processing [182].\n\n7.1.2\n\nNeutral atoms\n\nThe ease of manipulation of trapped ions using electric fields is a double-edged sword,\nin the sense that this very feature also makes trapped ions highly sensitive to the environment they are immersed in. One can avoid these issues through the use of neutral\natoms rather than ions. Neutral atoms, however, cannot easily be confined to subwavelength regions without complex experimental systems such as the one used in a\nrecent proof-of-concept experiment presented in Ref. [183].\n\n7.1.3\n\nOptomechanics-Cantilevers and micromirrors\n\nRecent years have seen a surge in the popularity of optomechanics experiments, mostly\nwith the aim of reaching the ground vibrational state of a vibrating reflective cantilever [8], or of a reflective micro-membrane [114]. The use of such optical elements\nintroduces a number of interesting possibilities:\n1\n\nIt must be pointed out that such ions would have a translational temperature lower than that which\ncan be achieved through mirror-mediated cooling setups using typical experimental parameters. The\naims of such experiments would be (i) a proof-of-principle demonstration, and (ii) an exploration of\nthe wavelength-scale variations of the forces.\n\n\f159\n\nA guide for future experiments\n\n\u2022 Engineered internal resonances-Ref. [184] looks at using resonances inside a photonic crystal as a means of controlling its motion, in much the same way as one\nuses atomic resonances in Doppler cooling. In contrast with the case of an atom\nor ion, however, one can engineer the system to have a wide range of different\nproperties.\n\u2022 Strong mirror\u2013field coupling-Single atoms or ions do not have a large polarisability unless the driving field is close to resonance; this is problematic because\nstrong heating effects become important under such conditions. Mirrors, even microscopic ones, consist of vast numbers of atoms, each of which is essentially an\nindividual dipole, and therefore experience correspondingly stronger effects.\n\u2022 Positioning-micromirrors enjoy the advantages of both ease of positioning, shared\nwith ions, and the immunity to electrostatic forces, shared with neutral atoms.\nMoreover, the technology exists to make silicon nitride (SiN) membranes much\nthinner than an optical wavelength [129], so such mirrors can indeed be used to\nexplore sub-wavelength structure in the forces.\n\n7.1.4\n\nDielectric particles\n\nSpherical dielectric particles, of sizes on the nanometre [17, 79] or micrometre [185]\nscales, have been proposed as replacements for individual atoms in cooling experiments.\nOn the small end of the scale, the particles can be suspended using purely optical\nforces and are therefore not coupled to any physical heat bath. Nevertheless, even such\nsmall particles exhibit polarisabilities much larger than that of an individual atom, and\ntherefore correspondingly stronger interactions with the light field. The larger particles\nwould need to be physically supported, perhaps by being mounted on the end of a\ntapered fibre. This could, in turn, be achieved by ablating the tapered end of the fibre\nto form a microsphere. The mechanical properties of such a fibre would ensure poor\ncoupling of phonons between the microsphere and the bulk fibre.\nThe response to the electric field of a dielectric particle on the nanometre scale is related\nto its complex permeability \u000f through the Clausius\u2013Mossotti relation:\n\u03c7 = 3V\n\n\u000f\u22121\n.\n\u000f+2\n\n(7.1)\n\n\f160\n\nA guide for future experiments\n\nFigure 7.1: Optical micrograph of a section of a templated gold surface. The bright\nspot in each of the dimples is the focus. The centre\u2013to\u2013centre distance is 100 \u03bcm and\nthe depth of the electrodeposited gold is 15 \u03bcm. (Courtesy Nathan Cooper.)\n\nThe derivation of the Clausius\u2013Mossotti equation itself has some interesting subtleties\nthat are discussed in Appendix 7.A. \u000f is furthermore related to the real, \u03b7, and imaginary,\n\u221a\n\u03ba, parts of the refractive index n = \u000f by\nRe{\u000f} = \u03b7 2 \u2212 \u03ba2 , and\n\n(7.2)\n\nIm{\u000f} = 2\u03b7\u03ba .\n\n(7.3)\n\nFinally, \u03ba is related to the 1/e power absorption length of a substance, 1/\u03b1, by \u03b1 =\n2k\u03ba at wavenumber k. For the common dielectric PMMA [poly(methyl methacrylate)]\n\u03b7 = 1.5 and, conservatively, \u03b1 = 50 m\u22121 at a wavelength \u03bb = 1 \u03bcm in vacuum [186]; i.e.,\n\u0001\n\u000f = 2.2 + 1.2 \u00d7 10\u22125 i. The imaginary part of \u000f is much smaller than the real part and\n\ncan generally be neglected when calculating optical forces. It is, however, responsible\nfor absorption of part of the incident light and its effects cannot be neglected when\ncalculating the power absorbed by an illuminated dielectric.\n\n7.1.5\n\nDipole trap arrays\n\nTwo-dimensional arrays of dipole traps have been built using microfabricated lens arrays [64] and used to site-selectively address trapped atoms [187]. However, the use\nof refractive elements such as lens arrays brings with it a number of disadvantages, of\nwhich we mention two:\n\u2022 Fabrication costs-each array has to be custom-made and it is difficult to massproduce such optical elements.\n\n\fA guide for future experiments\n\n161\n\nFigure 7.2: Schematic of an experiment to explore the mirror-mediated cooling mechanism. Light is focussed onto an ion trapped in an endcap trap, then coupled into a\nfibre. This light is retroreflected back into the fibre by means of a mirror whose position\ncan be adjusted through piezoelectric elements.\n\n\u2022 Integration-lens arrays require optical access from both sides, leading to a larger\napparatus and making it difficult to integrate them into so-called atom chips [168].\n\nOne way to overcome both these issues is to use arrays of reflective concave mirrors,\nwhich can be manufactured easily (this was explored in Fig. 6.1). The end product, as\nshown in Fig. 7.1, is indeed close to ideal in terms of periodicity and surface quality.\nThese concave mirrors can be used to construct individual dipole traps for either neutral\natoms or ions.\nThe interest in using such arrays of mirrors lies not only in their ease of manufacture but\nalso in the surface plasmon resonances that are exhibited by the individual hemispherical\nmirrors [159]. Such resonances couple to the incident light and give rise the possibility\nof mechanisms of the \"external cavity cooling\" type, Section 4.1, using not Fabry\u2013\nP\u00e9rot cavities but material resonances. The advantages of using such a system are\nimmediately obvious; we mention only that such a setup introduces the possibility of\ntwo-dimensional arrays of individual optical resonant elements that require essentially no\nalignment. Coupled with the fact that external cavity cooling, as with any mechanism\nbased on the dipole force, is not species-selective, this leads to the possibility of producing\ntwo-dimensional arrays of cold ions, atoms, or even micromirrors. Such arrays would\npotentially revolutionise quantum information processing by implementing a scalable\ntwo-dimensional register for quantum information.\n\n7.1.6\n\nPlane mirror cooling\n\nThe mirror-mediated cooling setup would be the most basic proof-of-concept experiment\nof optical cooling using a memory, seeing as it involves merely one mirror. As has been\ndiscussed previously, the friction force in such a setup oscillates on a sub-wavelength\n\n\fA guide for future experiments\n\n162\n\nscale and, moreover, is only sizeable for atom\u2013mirror distances of the order of metres.\nA realistic approach to implementing this delay is to couple the light, after interacting\nwith the atom, into a single-mode fibre. The light inside the fibre is then retroreflected\nand imaged back onto the atom itself. This setup, shown schematically in Fig. 7.2, is\nconceptually similar to the one used in Ref. [103]. In Fig. 7.2, the species to be cooled\nis shown to be a trapped ion rather than a neutral atom. The reason for this is again\nthe small length scale over which the friction force changes from a cooling to a heating\nforce, necessitating very good localisation of the particle to be cooled. One also notes\nthat the delay line length must be stabilised interferometrically.\n\n7.1.7\n\nExternal cavity cooling\n\nThe use of an optical resonance to enhance the cooling effect of the retarded dipole\u2013dipole\ninteraction presents a novel way of enhancing the performance of current optomechanical\nexperiments. Indeed, such setups would be less sensitive to misalignment of the mirror to\nbe cooled than traditional optomechanical setups [82], which require micromirrors with\nextremely good optical and mechanical properties. The sub-wavelength modulation\nof the friction force is an issue with this mechanism too, which necessitates the use of\nparticles-such as thin micromirrors, membranes, or trapped ions-that can be localised\nto within a small fraction of a wavelength.\n\n7.1.8\n\nRing cavity cooling\n\nOne may wish to do away with the sub-wavelength localisation problem inherent in\nmirror-mediated cooling altogether. Ring cavity cooling, discussed under the guise of\n\"amplified optomechanics\" in Section 4.3, provides one way of achieving this aim. This\nmechanism works best with particles that are rather poorly reflective, otherwise the\nadvantages of the amplifier gain are lost, and is therefore more suited towards the cooling\nof atoms rather than micromirrors. In this instance, both neutral atoms and trapped\nions are good candidates; it must also be mentioned that in the case of ions, cooling\ndown to a very low vibrational state is not needed in this case. The constraint on the\ndelay line length is not lifted, however: this must still be stabilised interferometrically.\n\n\fA guide for future experiments\n\n163\n\nFigure 7.3: Highly schematic illustration of a three-dimensional ring cavity cooling\nsetup. The pump light does not couple directly into any cavity, allowing one to use gain\nmedia in the fibres similarly to the amplified optomechanics scheme (see Section 4.3).\n\nAn extension of this scheme can be envisaged where the pump light is not injected into\nthe cavity but is directed off-axis at the particle. This geometry would not require an\nisolator, since the pump light never enters the cavity, and can easily be extended to\nthree dimensions; see Fig. 7.3.\n\n7.1.9\n\nConcave mirror cooling\n\nA final possibility is that of using the reflection from a concave hemispherical mirror\nitself, and not any material resonances supported by the mirror, to cool the motion of a\nparticle at the centre of curvature of the mirror. One would expect that for the effect to\nbe sizeable, the mirror radius would need to be much larger than a wavelength, perhaps\nof the order of millimetres or centimetres. A brief justification for why a cooling effect is\nexpected to exist in such a geometry is possible using the ideas developed in Section 2.4\nin the case where the particle experiences a repulsive interaction with its image. Such a\ncase could correspond to an atom illuminated by light tuned to the blue of its resonance.\nWhen the particle is near the centre of the mirror, a real image is formed that in steadystate is at the same distance from, but on the opposite side of, the centre. Given the\nsymmetry of the situation, it is enough to decompose the motion of the particle into\ntwo orthogonal motions, radially and tangentially in a polar coordinate system centred\non the centre of curvature of the mirror. In the case of radial motion, we will appeal to\nEq. (2.15). The repulsive potential U seen by a motionless particle at a small distance\n\n\f164\n\nA guide for future experiments\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 7.4: Origin of the friction force for tangential \"racetrack\" motion of a particle\naround the centre of curvature of a hemispherical mirror. (a) In the absence of delay,\nthe particle and its image are at diametrically opposite points in the circular locus of\nthe motion of the particle. (b) Due to delay, the image trails behind its equilibrium\nposition slowing the particle down due to the repulsive interaction between the two.\nNote that the length scales are greatly exaggerated; in reality, the particle, and the\npath it moves along, would be much smaller than depicted.\n\nr from the centre can be described by a Gaussian2 , having a peak at r = 0 and tailing\noff to zero as r increases. For concreteness, let us take\n\u0002\n\u0003\nU (r\u0303, r, v = 0) = U0 exp \u2212(r + r\u0303)2 /w2 ,\n\n(7.4)\n\nusing the notation of Section 2.4, where w is the width of the potential, taken to be the\nsame in every direction, and U0 is non-negative. Thus, using Eq. (2.15), we obtain the\ndelayed friction force\nF = 2U0 \u03c4 v\n\n\u0001\n8r2 \u2212 w2\nexp \u22124r2 /w2 ,\n4\nw\n\n(7.5)\n\nwhich is a cooling force for small r, and where \u03c4 = 2R/c is the delay time for a mirror\nof radius of curvature R.\nThe origin of the cooling force for motion in the tangential direction is best explained\npictorially. Fig. 7.4 shows the particle moving in a circle of constant radius around\nthe centre of the mirror. In the absence of delay, Fig. 7.4(a), the particle and its image\n2\n\nTo a good approximation, a small particle close to the centre of a spherical mirror produces a spherical\nGaussian image upon focussing by the mirror [138].\n\n\fA guide for future experiments\n\n165\n\nwould be in diametrically opposite positions along this circle. Due to the delay, however,\nthe image lags behind its equilibrium position, as shown in Fig. 7.4(b). The repulsive\ninteraction between the particle and its image thereby produces a force opposing the\nmotion of the particle. This force can easily be seen to increase with both v and \u03c4 , since\nthe distance between the particle and its image decreases with both these quantities, and\ntherefore acts to cool the tangential motion of the particle. Putting these two arguments\ntogether implies that a particle undergoing any motion around the centre of curvature\nof a spherical mirror experiences a friction force mediated by the delayed dipole\u2013dipole\ninteraction.\n\n7.2\n\nCooling forces experienced in different geometries\n\nIn this section we shall use the three-dimensional scattering theory developed in Chapter 5 to obtain the cooling forces experienced by a point-like dipole in a number of\ndifferent configurations, both (quasi-)one-dimensional and three-dimensional.\n\n7.2.1\n\nLongitudinal mirror-mediated cooling\n\nIn one dimension, the mirror-mediated cooling force is given, in agreement with Eq. (5.7),\nas\nF=\u2212\n\n\u0001\n1 E02 2 3\n\u000f0 \u03c7 k x sin(4kx)v + O \u03c74 ,\n2c \u03c3L\n\n(7.6)\n\nwhere x is the position of the particle with respect to the mirror, and \u03c7 is the polarisability of the particle. Note that this force is oscillatory in the position of the particle\nand therefore has a zero spatial average on the wavelength scale.\nA close analogue to the one-dimensional case in three dimensions is that of longitudinal\npumping, where the pump field forms a standing wave with the mirror; this is the case\nconsidered earlier.

Upon reflection by the mirror, E 1 is in turn responsible\nfor inducing a polarisation P 1 in the particle. For each index i, E i is of the order \u03c7i\nand P i of the order \u03c7i+1 . The force acting on the particle due to a term of the form\nP \u2217i * E j is thereby of order \u03c7i+j+1 .

This has to be understood as being\nphysically separate from the factors of x introduced by the spreading of wavefronts in\nthree dimensions; indeed, in one dimension F \u221d x despite the fact that wavefronts do\nnot spread. We will factor this term out in the following.\n3\n\nThe averaging is done by assuming kx \u001d 1, which allows us to hold the 1/(kx)n terms constant and\naverage only over the periodic functions.\n\n\fA guide for future experiments\n\n167\n\nLet us first decompose the friction force in Eq. (7.7): there are two sets of terms, of order\n\u03c72 /(kx) and \u03c72 /(kx)2 , both of which arise from interactions of the form P \u22170 * E 1 and P \u22171 *\nE 0 . Respectively, these interactions represent the interaction of the polarisation induced\nby the incident field with the retarded re-radiated field, and that of the polarisation\ninduced by this retarded field with the incident electric field. The first term in the nonzero spatially averaged force, Eq. (7.8), is in this case entirely due to the geometrical\nspreading out of the wavefronts in the same terms. The second term, which arises from\na term that is not written explicitly in Eq. (7.7), has a different origin: it arises from\nthe phase-locked interaction between P 1 and E 1 , which has no sub-wavelength spatial\ndependence, since E 1 is a travelling wave and therefore any sub-wavelength dependences\nare factored out of the product P \u22171 * E 1 . It is this friction force that therefore arises from\na delayed 'self-binding' interaction.\n\n7.2.2\n\nTransverse mirror-mediated cooling\n\nIn three dimensions one is of course free to choose the direction of illumination. Let us\nagain consider the usual mirror-mediated cooling geometry, but where the pump light is\na circularly polarised wave in the x\u2013y plane travelling in the z-direction, i.e., propagating\nparallel to the mirror.

In a\ntransverse-pumping geometry, it is this self-binding force that is the dominant effect.\n\n7.2.3\n\nRing cavity cooling\n\nThe mechanism involved in ring cavity cooling is essentially the same as that involved\nin (one-dimensional) mirror-mediated cooling. Indeed, we can compare Eq. (4.10) to\nEq. (3.41) and deduce that the dominant friction force acting on a particle inside a ring\ncavity will be of the form\nF=\u2212\n\n1 E02 2 3\n\u000f0 \u03c7 k \u039bLv ,\n4c \u03c3L\n\n(7.11)\n\nwhere \u039b is a factor due to the properties of the cavity, and L the length of the cavity.\n\n7.2.4\n\nSummary: Orders of magnitude\n\nThe table below is a convenient reference for the forms of the dominant friction forces\nacting on a particle in the geometries discussed in this section.

The aim of this section is to\nevaluate the cooling forces and base temperatures for a few specific situations.\n\n7.3.1\n\nOne-dimensional mirror-mediated cooling: Trapped ion\n\nThe 'fine structure' in the friction force produced in the mirror-mediated cooling geometry in one dimension is perhaps best explored using trapped ions, as shown schematically in Fig. 7.2. We assume that the species being cooled is a Ba+ ion, and that\nthe pump beam is at a wavelength of \u03bb = 493 nm, detuned by \u2206 = \u00b110\u0393 from resonance and focussed down to a 10 \u03bcm spot at the position of the ion. The length of\nthe fibre-based delay line is taken to be L = 2 m. In order to ensure operation in the\nlow-saturation regime, we set the pump power to be P = 1 nW. The mass of the ion is\nm = 2.3 \u00d7 10\u221225 kg. These numbers result in:\n1/e velocity cooling time: 12 ms, and\nsteady-state temperature: 570 \u03bcK.\n\nBoth of these numbers decrease linearly with increasing L and include a factor of\n\n1\n2\n\noriginating from the presence of the harmonic trap confining the motion of the ion, as\nexplained in Section 2.6.2.3. Doppler cooling of the ion, after which the position spread\nof the particle would be smaller than a wavelength (specifically, ca. 35 nm in the setup\nof Ref. [103]), would be necessary to resolve the sub-wavelength features in the friction\nforce.\n\n\f170\n\nA guide for future experiments\n\n7.3.2\n\nExternal cavity cooling: Transmissive membrane\n\nWe have already remarked that external cavity cooling would act to enhance optomechanical cooling mechanisms, such as those used to cool the vibrational motion of reflective mirrors. Let us suppose we use a membrane with power transmissivity of 50%\nand couple the transmitted light into a Fabry-P\u00e9rot cavity, whose mirrors have power\ntransmissivities of 1%. A typical commercially-available SiN membrane would have an\neffective mass m = 5 \u00d7 10\u221214 kg [114] for the centre-of-mass mode and negligible absorption. Coupling in 1 mW of light at a wavelength \u03bb = 780 nm thereby gives\n\n1/e velocity cooling time: 1 ms, and\nsteady-state temperature: 35 \u03bcK,\n\nwith the steady-state temperature being a lower limit in the absence of any absorbed\npower or coupling to a substrate.\n\n7.3.3\n\nAmplified optomechanics: Neutral atom\n\nThe friction force in amplified optomechanics, or ring cavity cooling in general, is not\ndependent on the position of the particle to be cooled. To explore this mechanism,\nwe therefore suggest using neutral atoms. Our atom of choice is\n\n85 Rb\n\n(mass m =\n\n1.4 \u00d7 10\u221225 kg), which can be Doppler-cooled and confined to a small cloud beforehand.\nWe assume that the pump beam, of wavelength \u03bb = 780 nm and detuning \u2206 = \u221210\u0393,\nis focussed down to a 10 \u03bcm spot at the position of the atom, and that the power at\nthe input coupler is 13 nW to guarantee operation in the low-saturation regime. The\nfibre-based cavity is taken to be 300 m long, the power loss at each of the two couplers\nterminating the cavity is assumed to be 50%, and the input coupler to transmit only 1%\nof the incident power. A gain medium, with gain 1.75, is assumed to form part of the\ncavity. We therefore obtain\n\n1/e velocity cooling time: 4 ms, and\nsteady-state temperature: 40 \u03bcK.\n\n\f171\n\nA guide for future experiments\n\n7.A\n\nAppendix: Electric fields inside dielectrics\n\nWithin a simple model of the dielectric of volume V as a collection of closely spaced\ndipoles at random positions, its response to an electric field can be embodied entirely in\nthe relative permittivity \u000f, defined by the relation\nP = V (\u000f \u2212 1)\u000f0 E ,\n\n(7.12)\n\nThe Clausius\u2013Mossotti relation, as quoted in Eq. (7.1), connects the susceptibility \u03c7\nof the dielectric to the bulk refractive index of the dielectric. Many derivations of\nthis relation (see, for example, Ref. [44, \u00a74.5]) divide the dielectric into two regions:\na spherical section of the dielectric, large enough to contain several dipoles but small\nenough that the polarisation is practically constant within; and the rest of the dielectric.\nOne objection to this argument is that it depends critically on the first region chosen\nas being spherical, an assertion that has no real physical justification and no immediate\nconnection to the main assumption, mentioned below, present in the Clausius\u2013Mossotti\nrelation. Hannay [188] presented an alternative derivation of this same expression that\ndoes not make use of this model. Let us briefly recapitulate Hannay's argument.\nThe electric field E produced by an ideal point-like dipole p is, as a function of the\ndisplacement r from the dipole,\n\"\n#\n1\n3(p * r)r\np\np\nE=\n\u2212 3 \u2212\n\u03b4(r) .\n5\n4\u03c0\u000f0\n|r|\n|r|\n3\u000f0\n\n(7.13)\n\nThe central assumption that leads to the Clausius\u2013Mossotti equation is that a \"test\"\ndipole inserted at a random position in the dielectric experiences an electric field that is\nfree from the influence of the \u03b4-spikes that occur at each of the dipoles making up the\ndielectric. These \u03b4-spikes, of which there are N , contribute a spatially-averaged field\n\u2212\n\nP\nNp\n=\u2212\n,\n3V \u000f0\n3V \u000f0\n\n(7.14)\n\ndefining the macroscopic polarisation of the medium by P \u2261 N p. Thus, the field\nexperienced by the test dipole-and, therefore, the field inside the medium-is equal to\nthe \"normalised\" field\nE norm = E +\n\nP\n,\n3V \u000f0\n\n(7.15)\n\n\f172\n\nA guide for future experiments\n\nwhere E is the local microscopic spatial average of the electric field that the dielectric is\nimmersed in. Finally, E norm is related to P through the definition of \u03c7 [44, \u00a74.5],\nP = \u000f0 \u03c7E norm\n\nP\n= \u000f0 \u03c7 E +\n3V \u000f0\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(7.16)\n\nThus,\nP = V (\u000f \u2212 1)\u000f0 E =\n\n\u000f0 \u03c7E\n\u0001,\n1 \u2212 \u03c7/ 3V\n\n(7.17)\n\nwhich can be rearranged to give the Clausius\u2013Mossotti equation:\n\u03c7 = 3V\n\n\u000f\u22121\n.\n\u000f+2\n\n(7.18)\n\nFor a particle of volume V made from a typical dielectric with a refractive index n = 1.5,\n\u03c7 = 0.9V \u2248 V . An intuitive understanding of \u03c7 is therefore possible as the volume of\ndielectric that is polarised by an incoming field. It is perhaps interesting to note that this\nmeans that each single molecular dipole in the dielectric has an effective susceptibility\n4\n\u03c7eff \u2248 \u03c0a3 ,\n3\n\n(7.19)\n\nwhere 2a is the mean distance between the molecules making up the dielectric; a \u223c\n10\u221210 m is typically several orders of magnitude larger than the molecular radius itself.\n\nHowever, \u03c7eff is of the same order as the susceptibility of a free molecule [189]. In other\nwords, the polarisation of an individual dipole due to an off-resonant electric field is of\nabout the same order whether that dipole is isolated or in a bulk solid.\nThis \u03c7 can be used to calculate the power dissipated by a small dielectric sphere, modelled as a single point dipole, due to blackbody radiation.

The size of the hemispherical template and the depth of the void\n(15 \u03bcm vertically from the bottom to the lip) match the surface in Fig. 7.1.\n\ncan be made with several tens (for large diameters) up to several hundreds (for diameters\nof the order of 1 \u03bcm [190]) of dimples. However, the analysis of the electromagnetic fields\ninside the dimples presents a challenge. The most direct route to exploring these fields\nis through the numerical solution of Maxwell's equations. A large number of software\npackages are available, with several operating either on finite element method (FEM) or\nfinite-difference time-domain (FDTD) principles or employing Mie theory (see Ref. [191]\nfor a recent review of such techniques). Analyses of scattering of electromagnetic radiation off spherical particles are usually performed using Mie theory [44], which exploits\nthe fact that the vector spherical harmonics form a complete orthogonal set of modes on\nthe sphere. In the case of a hemisphere, however, no such set of modes exists-and the\nsituation is even worse for truncated hemispheres-and FEM or FDTD techniques are\nmore desirable. It is interesting to note that this problem can be formally circumvented\nin certain situations. For example, the authors of Ref. [181] implicitly assume knowledge\nof the field outside the spherical region defined by a perfect truncated hemispherical mirror to explore the behaviour of the vacuum field inside this same spherical region. In\nthe absence of a compact analytical solution, we use an open-source software package\ncalled MEEP [192] for our analysis.\nWe show an example of such a simulated field in Fig. 7.5. Close to the geometrical focus\nof the dimple, a strong focus is found; the size and peak intensity of this focus can be\nused to explore the possibility of producing single- or few-atom dipole traps inside such\ncavities. 2D arrays of dipole traps were demonstrated [64] a number of years ago, and\nrecently used to perform site-selective manipulation of atoms [187]-both these experiments relied on a purpose-built refractive micro-lens array. Using templated surfaces\noffers a number of advantages over the micro-lens array, not least ease of manufacture\nand the possibility of integration into so-called atom chips [168]; in this regard, the use\nof reflective rather than refractive optical elements is of paramount importance.\n\n\f175\n\nA guide for future experiments\n\nThe dimples in the first surface produced for the experimental investigations in Southampton were not grown to full hemispheres. Rather, latex spheres with a diameter of 100 \u03bcm\nwere used and gold was only templated up to a depth of 15 \u03bcm. Part of the resulting\nsurface is shown in Fig. 7.1, with the field inside one such dimple simulated in Fig. 7.6.\nNote that aliasing artifacts are more apparent in this figure than in Fig. 7.5, the reason\nbeing that the 0.05 \u03bcm resolution possible in the case of the latter was not possible\nin simulating the larger sample, due to computer memory constraints. In the case of\nFig. 7.6, a resolution of 0.17 \u03bcm was used. In both cases, the incoming field was a plane\nwave with a wavelength of \u03bb = 780 nm.\n\n7.C\n\nAppendix: Force acting on an atom inside an arbitrary monochromatic field\n\nIn a remarkable piece of work dating to 1980, Gordon and Ashkin [52] give several useful\nexpressions for the force and diffusion experienced by an atom inside what they called a\n'radiation trap'-essentially an arbitrary (monochromatic) electric field. Implicit in their\nwork is the assumption that the system has no 'memory'; we cannot directly apply their\nequations to mirror-mediated or external cavity cooling systems, for example. Nonetheless, such a model is perhaps the easiest way of exploring the behaviour of atoms inside\nfields as complex as those in hemispherical voids on a metal surface. Unfortunately,\nthe authors of Ref. [52] do not give explicit general formulae for the velocity-dependent\nforce acting on an atom; we will now generalise their expressions [specifically, Eqs. (14)\nand (15)] to the case when the atom is not motionless. Let us first briefly introduce\nthe notation we will use in this section:4 F is the force acting on the atom; D is the\ndifference in the populations of the upper and lower states; \u03c3 is the atomic lowering\noperator; \u2206 = \u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9a , with \u03c9 the frequency of the driving field and \u03c9a the atomic\nresonance frequency; \u03b3 = \u0393 \u2212 i\u2206; \u03bc21 the atomic dipole operator; v the atomic velocity;\n\nand Ee\u2212i\u03c9t the classical incident electric field. We also define\ng = ~i \u03bc21 * E ,\n4\n\nOur notation will be identical to Ref. [52] wherever possible.\n\n(7.22)\n\n\f176\n\nA guide for future experiments\n\nand the saturation parameter s = 2|g|2 /|\u03b3|2 . It is also convenient to define the vectors\n\u03b1 and \u03b2 by grad g = (\u03b1 + i\u03b2)g. In practice, numerical simulation gives us knowledge of\nE, assuming that the perturbation of the atom on the field is quite small. By specifying\nthe magnetic field, we can determine \u03c9a , and therefore \u2206. Given the atomic species, we\nalso know \u0393 and \u03bc21 ; knowledge of \u03b3, g, s, \u03b1, \u03b2 and h\u03c3i then follows, as we will see.\nFinally, this determines hFi, the classical force acting on the atom.\nTo first order in v, we have\n\u0002\n\u0003\nhFi = \u2212i~ h\u03c3i\u2217 grad g \u2212 h\u03c3i grad g \u2217 ,\n\nh\u03c3\u0307i + \u03b3h\u03c3i = hDig ,\n\nh\u1e0ai + 2\u0393hDi = 2\u0393 \u2212 2(g \u2217 h\u03c3i + gh\u03c3i\u2217 ) ,\n2s\nh\u1e0ai = \u2212 1+s\n(v * \u03b1)hDi ,\n\u0002\n\u0003\nh\u03c3\u0307i = (v * \u03b1) 1\u2212s\n1+s + i(v * \u03b2) h\u03c3i , and\n\n\u0121 = v * (\u03b1 + i\u03b2)g ,\n\n(7.23)\n(7.24)\n(7.25)\n(7.26)\n(7.27)\n(7.28)\n\ndirectly from Ref.

Increasingly, research is focussing more\nand more towards the use of cold atoms in applications such as sensing, metrology and\ninformation processing. This trend has made it ever more important to find means of\ncooling more general species of atoms and molecules; current methods are simply too\nspecies-selective. Throughout the course of this thesis I have shown how the retarded\ndipole\u2013dipole interaction can be used to achieve this aim; by investing the dipole force\nwith a non-conservative nature, one can transfer energy from a moving polarisable particle to or from the light field-the nature of the particle itself is largely irrelevant. Several\nkey theoretical results were reported in this thesis; these are summarised below:\n\u2022 By introducing a time delay, in a very general sense, into an optical system, one\ncan endow the dipole interaction with a non-conservative nature.\n\u2022 This delayed dipole\u2013dipole interaction is a very general mechanism and applies to\nanything that is acted upon by the dipole force.\n\u2022 In order to explore these interactions, we devised an extended formalism based on\nthe transfer matrix method and applied it successfully to various cooling schemes.\n\u2022 The prototypical mirror-mediated cooling mechanism was explored in great detail and its shortcomings addressed through external cavity cooling and amplified\noptomechanics.\n\u2022 Apart from rendering the exploration of the above cooling mechanisms possible,\nthe formalisms we extended also naturally lead to the unification of cooling mechanisms for atomic motion, and optomechanical cooling mechanisms for micromirror\nvibrations.\n177\n\n\fA guide for future experiments\n\n178\n\nThe basis for an experimental investigation of these cooling mechanisms was also laid\nin the latter parts of this thesis, the main results of which are\n\u2022 an experimental apparatus that simplifies the investigation of the interactions between atoms and surfaces structured on the nano- or micro-scale;\n\u2022 a multi-level imaging system for exploring cold atom clouds near highly reflective\nand highly scattering surfaces; and\n\u2022 the exploration of a number of physical configurations that promise experimentallyobservable effects under realisable conditions.\n\nWork is currently underway to better understand the nature of the retarded dipole\u2013\ndipole interaction in three dimensions and in a more general geometric setting; it is\nhoped that this understanding will greatly facilitate the production of systems, perhaps\nof an integrated nature, that can be tailored to generate cold samples of any arbitrary\nspecies. Such systems would revolutionise sensing and metrology applications and also\nprovide an unprecedented means of interfacing with the quantum nature of matter at\nthe micro- and mesoscopic scales.\nSeveral questions are raised by the work in this thesis that are as yet unanswered, but\nwhich can form the basis of theoretical work in the future, are:\n\u2022 Can the vectorial electromagnetic field inside a possibly truncated, micro- or mesoscopic, hemispherical mirror be expressed succinctly? Small hemispherical mirrors\nviolate the approximations usually assumed in optics, namely the paraxial and ray\napproximations. The resulting behaviour of the electric field inside such deeply\ncurved surfaces is very intricate. Some work has been done using scattering theories\n(see, for example, Refs. [193] and [194]), but these theories lead to numericallyintensive computations and do not give the insight required to explore the system\nfrom the point of view of the retarded dipole\u2013dipole interaction.\n\u2022 A natural generalisation of the transfer matrix method for static scatterers in three\ndimensions is the scattering matrix theory; can this latter theoretical framework\nbe extended to account for the motion of scatterers? The transfer matrix method\nexplored in this thesis provides a very general formalism for exploring light\u2013matter\n\n\fA guide for future experiments\n\n179\n\ninteractions. It is, however, limited to systems that are inherently in one dimension, systems that can be reduced to one dimension (such as ring cavities), or\nsystems interacting with an electric field that can be described in terms of plane\nwaves along orthogonal dimensions. Systems such as colloidal crystals in two or\nthree dimensions cannot be explored using the matrix theory described in this\nthesis, and yet potentially present highly interesting dynamics mediated by light.\n\u2022 The transfer matrix approach presented is based on the assumption of a quasistatic system. Within such a framework, the motion of any scatterer must be slow\nenough for the system to reach optical steady-state at every point. Thus, any\nmotion must be slow on the timescale defined by the decay lifetime of any cavity\ninteracting with the scatterer. This condition specifically rules out operation in the\nso-called 'resolved sideband' regime which, in the case of both micromirrors [82]\nand ions [195], has been shown to lead to the most efficient cooling processes.\nIn particular, it is not yet known whether the external cavity cooling mechanism\nwould be as effective in this regime.\n\n\fPart IV\n\nAppendices:\nPublications\n&\nTalks\n\n180\n\n\fAppendix A\n\nPublications\nWherever published work was used in this thesis, this was clearly indicated.

Multiple scattering to all orders is taken into account. The theory is applied to describe the\nscheme of a Fabry-Perot resonator with one of its mirrors moving. The friction force, as well as the\ndiffusion, acting on the moving mirror is derived. In the limit of a small reflection coefficient, the\nsame model provides for the description of the mechanical effect of light on an atom moving in front\nof a mirror.\nPACS numbers: 37.10.De, 37.10.Vz, 42.70.Qs\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe use of light forces to manipulate mechanical motion has been extended by now from the translational\nmotion of single atoms [1, 2] to the motional modes\nof massive systems, such as the oscillations of a micromechanical mirror [3, 4, 5]. The theoretical approach\nto describe the mechanical effect of light on the centerof-mass motion of atoms is completely distinct from the\nmodels dealing with vibrating optical resonators. In the\nfirst case, theories are based on the assumption that\natoms are very weak scatterers in free space, negligibly\nperturbing the impinging bright laser beams [6]. In the\nother case, the influence of the moving massive component on the radiation field is so strong that it is considered a (moving) boundary condition defining a single\nor a few modes of the field participating in the optomechanical coupling [7, 8]. This is clearly the case for a\nFabry-Perot type resonator with one of its mirrors moving [9, 10, 11]. We argue that these two cases can be\ndealt with as two extremes of a general system that can\nbe described in a unified theoretical framework.\nIn this paper we develop and present a scattering\ntheory for opto-mechanically coupled systems, allowing\nfor the efficient description of the motion of arbitrary\ncombinations of atoms and mirrors interacting through\nthe radiation field. We will restrict the model to onedimensional motion and small velocities. The main building block is the beamsplitter transfer matrix [12, 13], i.e.,\nthe local relation between light field amplitudes at the\ntwo sides of a scatterer. We will calculate the radiation\nforce acting on a moving scatterer up to linear order in\nthe velocity. The model is completed by including the\nquantum fluctuations of the radiation force which stem\n\n\u2217 To whom all correspondence should be addressed. Electronic address: andre.xuereb@soton.ac.uk\n\nfrom the quantized nature of the field. We will determine\nthe momentum diffusion coefficient corresponding to the\nminimum quantum noise level.\nThe system we will consider in some detail is composed of two mirrors; one of them is fixed in space, whilst\nthe other one is mobile. This is the generic scheme for\nradiation-pressure cooling of moving mirrors [14, 15, 16].\nAt the same time, in the limit of low reflection the moving\nmirror can equally well represent a single atomic dipole\ninteracting with its mirror image in front of a highly reflecting surface [17, 18, 19]. The scattering model description of this example gives a clear recipe for generalizing the method to more complex systems.\n\nII.\n\nMODEL\n\nFIG. 1: The four different modes that interact through a\npoint-like beamsplitter in 1D.\n\nConsider a point-like scatterer (or beamsplitter), BS,\nmoving along the 'x' axis on the trajectory xBS (t). Outside the scatterer, the electric field E can be expressed\nin terms of a discrete sum of left- and right-propagating\nplane wave modes with different wave numbers, k, and\nhence different frequencies, \u03c9 = kc:\n(P \u0002\n\u0003\nA(k)e\u2212ikx\u2212i\u03c9t + B(k)eikx\u2212i\u03c9t + c.c.\n\u0003\nE = Pk \u0002\n\u2212ikx\u2212i\u03c9t\n+ D(k)eikx\u2212i\u03c9t + c.c. ,\nk C(k)e\n(1)\nwhere A(k) and B(k) are the mode amplitudes on the left\nside, x < xBS (t), while C(k) and D(k) are the amplitudes\non the right side, x > xBS (t), of BS. This is a simplifying\n\n\f2\nassumption and all our results also hold for a continuum\nof field modes. In accordance, the magnetic field is [20]\n(P \u0002\n\u0003\n\u2212 A(k)e\u2212ikx\u2212i\u03c9t + B(k)eikx\u2212i\u03c9t + c.c.\n\u0003\ncB = Pk \u0002\n\u2212ikx\u2212i\u03c9t\n+ D(k)eikx\u2212i\u03c9t + c.c. .\nk \u2212 C(k)e\n(2)\nAs depicted schematically in Fig. 1, the scatterer mixes\nthese waves. Our first goal is the derivation of the transverse matrix M connecting the field amplitudes on the\nright to those on the left side of a beamsplitter moving\nat a fixed velocity v. This relation is well-known [12] for\nan immobile scatterer. Therefore, let us first transform\nthe electromagnetic field into a frame moving with the\ninstantaneous velocity v of the BS.\nA.\n\nTransfer matrix for an immobile beamsplitter\n\nIn the frame co-moving with BS, the interaction of the\nfield with the scatterer at x\u2032 = 0 can be characterized by\nthe single parameter \u03b6 by means of the one dimensional\nwave equation [12, 20],\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n2\n\u2202x2\u2032 \u2212 2 \u2202t2\u2032 E \u2032 (x\u2032 , t\u2032 ) = 2 \u03b6 \u03b4(x\u2032 ) \u2202t2\u2032 E \u2032 (x\u2032 , t\u2032 ) .\nc\nkc\nThe electric field can be considered in a modal decomposition similar to Eq. (1). Since a fixed beamsplitter couples only the plane waves with identical frequency and\nwave number, the stationary scattering can be fully described within the closed set of modes\n(\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nA\u2032 e\u2212ikx \u2212i\u03c9t + B \u2032 eikx \u2212i\u03c9t + c.c. x\u2032 < 0\nE \u2032 (x\u2032 , t\u2032 ) =\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nC \u2032 e\u2212ikx \u2212i\u03c9t + D\u2032 eikx \u2212i\u03c9t + c.c. x\u2032 > 0 ,\nwhere the index k has been dropped. A linear relation\nbetween the field amplitudes on the right of the scatterer and those on the left can be derived from the wave\nequation,\n\u0012 \u2032\u0013\n\u0012 \u2032\u0013\nA\nC\n, with\n(3)\n=\nM\n0\nB\u2032\nD\u2032\nM0 =\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n1 1 \u2212r\n1 \u2212 i\u03b6 \u2212i\u03b6\n=\n.\ni\u03b6\n1 + i\u03b6\nt r t2 \u2212 r2\n\n(4)\n\nIn the second form of the transfer matrix M0 , we expressed it in terms of the reflectivity r and transmissivity\nt of the beamsplitter. This latter form is more convenient to describe moving mirrors, while for atoms the\nscattering strength parameter \u03b6 can be readily expressed\nin terms of the polarizability [12],\n\u03b6=\n\n\u03c0\u03b1\n,\n\u01eb0 \u03bbS\n\nwhere \u03b1 is the linear polarizability and S is the effective\nbeam cross section.

In this case the transfer matrix depends on\nthe wave number k, which might lead to essential effects,\ne.g., Doppler cooling, close to resonance with the atom\n(see Section II E).\nB.\n\nTransfer matrix for a moving beamsplitter\n\nThe transformation back into the laboratory-fixed\nframe involves the change of the coordinates, x\u2032 = x \u2212 vt\nand t\u2032 = t, and the Lorentz-boost of the electric field up\nto linear order in v/c [20, \u00a711.10]:\nE = E \u2032 + vB \u2032 ,\n\nwhere we assumed that E and E \u2032 are polarized in the\n'y' direction, B and B \u2032 are polarized in the 'z' direction,\nand the velocity is along the x axis.

The amplitude C at a given wave number k,\ni.e., C(k), \u0001is combined with the amplitudes A(k) and\nB k \u2212 2k vc . A similar statement holds for D(k).\nStarting from the knowledge of the incoming field amplitudes, this transfer matrix allows for calculating the\ntotal electromagnetic field around a beamsplitter moving with a fixed velocity. In the next step, we derive the\nforce on the moving scatterer through the Maxwell stress\ntensor.\nC.\n\nForce on a medium in an electromagnetic field\n\nThe Maxwell stress tensor (see [20, \u00a76.7]) is defined,\nfor a homogeneous medium in one dimension, x, as\n\u0011\n\u01eb0 \u0010\n2\n2\nT =\u2212\nE + c2 B\n,\n2\n\nwhere the electric field E and the magnetic field B,\nEq.

Although we considered first\nthe electric field composed of independent modes, in the\nforce expression only the sums of the mode amplitudes\noccur.\nD.\n\nQuantum fluctuations of the force\n\nIn the previous subsection the force was derived based\non the assumption that the field amplitudes are cnumbers. In order to describe the inherent quantum fluctuations of the force, we need to resort to the quantum\ntheory of fields and represent the mode amplitudes by\noperators: A(k) \u2192 \u00c2(k). To leading order the fluctuations of the force acting on a beamsplitter amount to\na momentum diffusion process [21, 22]. The diffusion\ncoefficient will be evaluated in the following in the minimum, quantum noise limit, which occurs in the case of\ncoherent-state fields [23].\nThe diffusion coefficient can be deduced from the\nsecond-order correlation function of the force operator [24, 25]\nF\u0302 (t)F\u0302 (t\u2032 ) \u2212 F\u0302 (t)\n\n2\n\n= D(t)\u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 ) .\n\n(10)\n\nThe evaluation of this quantum correlation is system specific. Quantum correlations, i.e., the operator algebra of\nthe mode amplitudes \u00c2(k), B\u0302(k), \u0108(k), and D\u0302(k), are\ninfluenced by multiple scattering and thus depend on the\n\n\f4\ntotal transfer matrix of the entire system. The simplest\ncase is a single beam splitter where the \"input\" modes\nB\u0302(k) and \u0108(k) have independent fluctuations. The calculation, delegated to Appendix B, includes all the steps\nneeded for the treatment of a general system. The diffusion coefficient for a single beamsplitter is obtained as\n\u0010\nD = (~k)2 A\n\n2\n\n+ B\n\n2\n\n+ C\n\n2\n\n+ D\n\n2\n\n+ 2 Re{rA\u2217 B \u2212 tA\u2217 C}\n\n\u0011\n+ 2 Re{rD\u2217 C \u2212 tD\u2217 B} , (11)\n\nwhere A, B, C, D are the photo-current amplitudes (their\nmodulus square is of the units of 1/sec), obeying Eq. (6)\nfor v = 0.\nAs an example, let us consider the diffusion coefficient\nfor a two-level atom illuminated by counter-propagating\nmonochromatic light waves. Using the polarizability \u03b6,\nthe transmission and reflection coefficients can be expressed as t = 1/(1 \u2212 i\u03b6) and r = i\u03b6/(1 \u2212 i\u03b6), respectively\n(see Eq. (4)). Eq.

Note that the diffusion process due to the recoil accompanying the spontaneous emission of a photon (see [25]) is missing from this\nresult-the detailed modeling of absorption, i.e., scattering photons into the three dimensional space, is not\nincluded in our approach.\n\nThese relations are substituted into Eq.

(9) to derive a general expression for the force on a moving beamsplitter illuminated\nby two counterpropagating, monochromatic, plane waves\nwith amplitudes B0 and C0 . On using Eq. (6) to express the outgoing field modes in terms of the incoming\nones, we note that the outgoing amplitudes comprise two\nmonochromatic terms each:\n\nA=\n\nh\ni\u03b6 1 \u2212\n\n\u0001i\n\u2202\u03b6\nB0 + C0\n2 \u2212 \u03c9\u03b6 \u2202\u03c9\n\u0011\n\u0010\n,\n\u2202\u03b6\n1 \u2212 i\u03b6 1 + vc \u03c9\u03b6 \u2202\u03c9\nv\nc\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\nh\n\u2202\u03b6\n1 \u2212 2i vc \u03c9 \u2202\u03c9\nB0 + i\u03b6 1 + vc 2 \u2212\n\u0010\n\u0011\nD=\n\u2202\u03b6\n1 \u2212 i\u03b6 1 + vc \u03c9\u03b6 \u2202\u03c9\n\n\u03c9 \u2202\u03b6\n\u03b6 \u2202\u03c9\n\nwhich, excluding the diffusion effects due to spontaneous\nemission, matches the standard result in [25]. Note,\nhowever, that the scattering theory leads to a more\ngeneral result which is represented by the terms of higher\norder in \u03b6. These terms describe the back-action of the\nscatterer on the field, an effect neglected in free-space\nlaser cooling theory.\nThe general result in Eq. (13) reveals that this velocitydependent force also acts on a scatterer whose polarisability is independent of the frequency. This is a very\ngeneral class and we will only focus on such scatterers in\nthe following.\nIII.\n\nand\n\u0001i\n\nC0\n\n.\n\n(15)\n\nGENERAL SYSTEM OF A FIXED AND A\nMOBILE SCATTERER\n\nConsider the model in Fig. 2 where the scatterer, or\n'atom', has a polarizability \u03b6 uniform over the frequency\nrange of interest.

Note that the free propagation transfer matrix Mp\nis non-uniform in the k-space, and therefore the Dopplershift has an influence on the phase shift accumulated between two scattering events.\nThe boundary condition is set as follows. Since there\nis no incoming field from the right, C(k) = 0 for all\nk. The incoming field from the left is assumed to be\nmonochromatic, B(k) = B\u03b4(k \u2212 k0 ), with k0 being the\npump wavenumber. The resulting field comprises modes\nwith wavenumbers in a narrow region around k0 . In\nthe laboratory frame the field mode A(k) interacts with\nB(k \u2212 2k vc ) and C \u2032 (k) through the Doppler-shift, and\nsimilarly for D\u2032 (k).

Then the atom\u2013\nmirror distance can be replaced by d = L \u2212 x, and k0 L\ndrops from all the trigonometric functions. The solution,\nEq. (17), has a clear physical meaning, in that the reflected field, A, can be decomposed into an interfering\nsum of fields: the first term is the reflection directly from\nthe atom, whereas the summation is over the electric field\nundergoing successive atom\u2013mirror round-trips. We can\nalso write the preceding expression in closed form:\n(\n1\ne\u22122ik0 x\nA=\ni\u03b6 + r\n1 \u2212 i\u03b6\n1 \u2212 i\u03b6 \u2212 ri\u03b6e\u22122ik0 x\n\"\nv\nr2 e\u22124ik0 x\n\u2212 2i \u03b6 1 \u2212\n\u00012\nc\n1 \u2212 i\u03b6 \u2212 ri\u03b6e\u22122ik0 x\n\u2212 2ik0 (L \u2212 x)\n\nr2 (1 \u2212 i\u03b6)e\u22124ik0 x\n\n1 \u2212 i\u03b6 \u2212 ri\u03b6e\u22122ik0 x\n\n\u00013\n\n#)\n\n.\n\n(18)\n\nThis result is valid for arbitrary \u03b6. The main virtue of our\napproach is clearly seen, in that we can smoothly move\nfrom \u03b6 = 0, which indicates the absence of the mobile\nscatterer, to |\u03b6| \u2192 \u221e, which corresponds to a perfectly\nreflecting mirror, i.e., a moving boundary condition.\nLet us outline some of the generic features of the above\ncalculation that would be encountered in a general configuration of scatterers. By using the formal Doppler-shift\noperators, we benefit from the transfer matrix method in\nkeeping the description of the system as a whole within\ntwo-by-two matrices. The input-output relation for the\ntotal system is always obtained in a form similar to that\nof Eq. (16). As long as the Doppler broadening is well\nbelow the transient time broadening of the system, the\ncalculation of forces and diffusion requires solely the sum\nof the mode amplitudes. An important point is that\nthe integrated action of the Doppler-shift operator P\u0302v\non monochromatic fields is a shift in k-space. Therefore,\nby interchanging the order of terms and putting the P\u0302v\nterms just to the left of the input field amplitudes, they\ncan be eliminated, such as in Eq. (17). Finally, up to\nfirst order in v/c, the resulting power series, a trace of\nmultiple reflections, can be evaluated in a closed form, as\nshown in Eq. (18). In conclusion, the illustrated method\nlends itself for the description of more complex schemes,\nfor example, the cooling of a moving, partially reflective\nmirror in a high-finesse Fabry-Perot resonator [26].\n\n\f6\nForce acting on the mobile scatterer\n\n40\n\nTo obtain the force on the moving scatterer, we also\nneed to evaluate C \u2032 (k) and D\u2032 (k):\n\u0012\n\nC \u2032 (k)\nD\u2032 (k)\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0001\n\u0013\n\u0015\u0012\n1 \u2212 i\u03b6\u0001\n\u2212i\u03b6 1 \u2212 2 vc P\u03022v\nA(k)\n,\n=\n\u22121\nB(k)\ni\u03b6 1 + 2 vc P\u03022v\n1 + i\u03b6\n(19)\n\u0014\n\nwhere we applied the inverse of the transfer matrix Ma .\nNext, we make the following definitions:\n\nFriction coefficient (units of ~k0 /(cB))\n\nA.\n\n\u03b6=1\n\u03b6 = 0.25\n\u03b6 = 0.06\n\u03b6 = 0.01\n\n30\n20\n10\n0\n-10\n\n\u00d70.01\n\n-20\n-30\n-40\n0\n\n2\n\n\u00d71000\n\u00d710\n\n0.2\n\n2\n\nA = |A| , B = |B| ,\nZ\nZ\n2\n1\n1\nC=\nC \u2032 (k) dk , D =\nD\u2032 (k) dk\nB\nB\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nk0 x/\u03c0\n2\n\nFIG. 3: (Color online.)

(18). The coefficient of the term linear in velocity, the 'friction coefficient' \u03b2, is plotted in Fig. 3 as a function of the position x\nin a half-wavelength range for various values of \u03b6. When\nvarying the coupling strength from \u03b6 = 0.01 up to \u03b6 = 1,\nthe friction coefficient transforms between two characteristic regimes. For small coupling the linear velocity\ndependence tends to a simple sinusoidal function while,\nfor large coupling, the friction exhibits a pronounced resonance in a narrow range. This resonance arises from\nthe increased number of reflections between the mobile\nscatterer and the fixed mirror. It can be observed that\nthe resonance shifts towards k0 x = \u03c0 on increasing \u03b6.\nIn the opposite limit of small \u03b6, the\n\u0001 maximum friction\nis obtained periodically at n \u2212 14 \u03c0/2 according to the\nsinusoidal function. The position of the maximum friction is plotted in Fig. 4(a), showing the transition from\n7\u03c0/8 to \u03c0. The maximum friction force is plotted in\nFig. 4(b), showing the two limiting cases of \u03b6 2 behavior,\nin the limit of small \u03b6, and \u03b6 6 behavior, in the limit of\nlarge \u03b6. These two cases are described in section IV and\nsection V, respectively.\n\nDiffusion coefficient\n\nThe calculation of the diffusion coefficient proceeds\nalong the same lines as that corresponding to a single\nbeamsplitter, shown in Appendix B. The difference is\nthat the modes B(k) and C \u2032 (k) around the mobile scatterer are not independent, for the reflection at the fixed\nmirror mixes them. Therefore, all the modes A, B, C \u2032 ,\nand D\u2032 have to be expressed in terms of the leftmost and\nrightmost incoming modes, B(k) and C(k), respectively.\nInstead of the derivation of such a general result for the\ndiffusion, here we will restrict ourselves to the special\ncase of r = \u22121 (\u21d4 perfect mirror) and real \u03b6 (\u21d4 no absorption in the moving mirror). In this special case the\ndiffusion calculation simplifies a lot, because (i) the perfect mirror prevents the modes C from penetrating into\nthe interaction region, and (ii) quantum noise accompanying absorption does not intrude in the motion of the\nscatterer.\nOnly the modes B\u0302(k) impart independent quantum\nfluctuations. When all the amplitudes around the scatterer are expressed in terms of B\u0302(k), and are inserted\ninto the force correlation function given in Eq. (10), the\ncommutator [b\u0302(t), b\u0302\u2020 (t\u2032 )] appears in all the terms (see Appendix B). Straightforward algebra leads to\nD = ~2 k02 B(A + 1 \u2212 C \u2212 D)2 .\n\n(21)\n\nWe emphasize that the above result is not general: the\ndiffusion is not necessarily proportional to the square of\nthe force. This simple relation here follows from the assumptions, r = \u22121 and Im{\u03b6} = 0, declared above.\nTo be consistent with the calculation of the friction\nforce linear in velocity, the diffusion should be evaluated\nonly for v = 0.

The velocity independent components of the modes obey the following relations: A = 1 and C\u2032 = D\u2032 (all incoming power\nis reflected).

The friction and the diffusion\ncoefficients are taken at the position where the friction\nis maximum, as shown in Fig. 4(a). The two limits of\nsmall and large scattering parameter \u03b6 will be analysed\nin section IV and section V, respectively.\n\nAn atom pumped with a far off-resonance beam can be\nmodelled as a moving mirror with small and real \u03b6. In\nthis section we accordingly truncate our expressions to\nsecond order in \u03b6. We also assume that the fixed mirror\nis perfect; i.e., r = \u22121 and t = 0. Thus,\n\b\nF = 2~k0 B 2\u03b6 Im{A} \u2212 2\u03b6 2 Re{A}\n\u0001\n\u0001\n(23)\n\u2212 \u03b6 2 1 + vc A \u2212 \u03b6 2 1 \u2212 vc .\n\nTo obtain F to second order in \u03b6, we need A to first\norder. Using Eq. (17) and Eq. (23), we obtain:\n\nA = \u2212 e\u22122ik0 x + \u03b6(i \u2212 2ie\u22122ik0 x + ie\u22124ik0 x )\n\u0003\n\u0002\n+ \u03b6 vc \u2212 2i + 2ie\u22124ik0 x \u2212 4k0 (L \u2212 x)e\u22124ik0 x , (24)\n\nand\n\nF = 4~k0 B \u03b6 sin(2k0 x)\n\b\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u2212 \u03b6 2 2 sin2 (k0 x) 4 cos2 (k0 x) \u2212 1\n\u0002\n\u2212 \u03b6 2 vc 4 sin2 (2k0 x)\n\u0003\u0001\n\u2212 4k0 (L \u2212 x) sin(4k0 x) ,\n\n(25)\n\nin agreement with [19]. In the far field (x \u226b \u03bb), the dominant friction term in the preceding expression is the last\nterm, which renders the sin(4k0 x) position dependence\nshown in Fig. 3 for \u03b6 = 0.01.\nWe are now in a position to derive the diffusion\ncoefficient for this system. By substituting Eq. (24)\ninto Eq. (21) and setting v = 0, we obtain\nD = 8(~k0 )2 \u03b6 2 B .\n\n\f8\nThis allows us to estimate the equilibrium temperature\nfor such a system at a position of maximum friction:\nkB T \u2248\n\n~\n, where \u03c4 = 2(L \u2212 x)/c ,\n2\u03c4\n\n(26)\n\nwhich we note is identical in form to the Doppler temperature for a two-level atom undergoing free-space laser\ncooling [6], but where we have replaced the upper state\nlifetime, 1/(2\u0393), by the round-trip time delay between\nthe atom and the mirror. Note that this temperature\ncorresponds to the constant value presented in Fig. 5 for\n\u03b6 < 0.1.\nV.\n\nOPTICAL RESONATOR WITH MOBILE\nMIRROR\n\nAfter the small polarizability case of the previous section, we will now consider the |\u03b6| \u2192 \u221e limit. We again\nassume that the fixed mirror of the resonator is perfect,\nwith r = \u22121, and that C = 0. For simplicity, we assume\nthat the moving mirror has a real polarizability. We expand the field mode amplitudes as power series in v/c,\nsuch that A = A0 + vc A1 + . . . , and similarly for C \u2032 .\nLet us first calculate the field in the resonator for v = 0.\nIt follows from Eq. (19) that\nC0\u2032 = (1 \u2212 i\u03b6)A0 \u2212 i\u03b6 = \u2212\n\ne\u22122i\u03c6\n,\n1 \u2212 i\u03b6 + i\u03b6e\u22122i\u03c6\n\nwith \u03c6 = k0 d, which has a maximum at \u03c60 obeying\n1\ntan(2\u03c60 ) = \u2212 .\n\u03b6\nIn the limit of \u03b6 \u2192 \u221e, the resonance is Lorentzian:\nC0\u2032 = \u2212\n\ne\u22122i\u03c6\nh\ni,\n2i(1 \u2212 i\u03b6) (\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c60 ) \u2212 i 4\u03b612\n\nwith a width of 1/(4\u03b6 2 ).\nThe perfect mirror reflects the total power incoming\nfrom the left, B. Moreover, for real \u03b6, there is no absorption in the moving mirror, so the outgoing intensity has\nto be equal to the incoming one: A = 1. This is true if\nv = 0; for v 6= 0, the field can do work on the mirror.\nThe expansion of the back reflected intensity to linear order in velocity reads A = 1 + 2 vc Re{A\u22170 A1 }. Extracting\nthe velocity-dependent terms for the general form of the\nforce in Eq. (20), it reduces to\n\u0001\n\b \u000e\nF 1 = vc 4~k0 B\u03b6 Im A1 1 + i\u03b6 \u2212 i\u03b6e2i\u03c6 ,\nwhich, after some algebra, leads to\nF 1 = \u2212 21 vc ~k02 L\n\n\u03b64\n\n\u0014\u0010\n\n(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c60 )\n\u00153 B .\n\u00112\n1\n2\n+\n(\u03c6\n\u2212\n\u03c6\n)\n0\n2\n4\u03b6\n\n(27)\n\n\u0001\nOn substituting \u03ba = c/ 4L\u03b6 2 , \u2206C = \u2212c(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c60 )/L,\n\u03b7 2 /(2\u03ba) = B, and G = c2 k02 /L2 , the friction force renders\nthat derived from the usual radiation pressure Hamiltonian in Appendix C.\nExpressing the field modes interacting with the mobile\nmirror in terms of the input field mode and performing\na calculation similar to that leading to Eq.

We note the similarity of the preceding expression with the temperature of an atom cooled in a cavity,\nin the good cavity limit [27]. We conjecture that this\nis due to the fact that both systems can be considered\nto involve the coupling of a laser with a system having\na decay rate \u03ba. This result also holds for the case of an\natom undergoing mirror-mediated cooling, as can be seen\nin Eq. (26).\nIt is also important to note that the above discussion\nonly treats the effects of the light fields on the scatterer.\nAs such, the temperature limit, Eq. (28), is intrinsic to\nthe light forces, and the mechanical damping and heating\nprocesses present in a real, macroscopic mirror-cooling\nsetup are not taken into account. In practice, these heating processes may dominate over the heating induced by\nthe quantum noise in the light field [28, 29]. In such cases,\nradiation pressure cooling is a possible means to lower the\nequilibrium temperature owing to the additional, optical\ndamping process.\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have presented a powerful extension of an existing\ntheoretical framework to analyse the interaction between\nlight and matter. The theory we presented is based on\nthe transfer matrix method for dealing with the interaction between scatterers and a light field, and is therefore\nable to handle complex optical systems, made from several elements, with relative ease. Through the use of the\nMaxwell stress tensor one can calculate the force acting\non any of the elements in the system. We have generalized the transfer matrix for slowly moving scatterers,\nthereby the corrections first-order in v/c can be calculated for the electromagnetic field as well as for the radiation force acting on the scatterer. Furthermore, one\ncan express this force in terms of the operators representing the quantized field modes interacting with the\n\n\f9\nscatterer and consequently derive the momentum diffusion of the scatterer due to the quantum noise present in\nthe fields. Our scattering theory can also transparently\ncover the whole range of interaction strengths, from the\nperturbative interaction between a weak standing wave\nand a single atom to the very strong (quasi boundarycondition) interaction between a pump light field and a\nFabry-Perot cavity with a moving mirror.\nWe also applied this framework to three different\nlaser cooling configurations: optical molasses, mirrormediated cooling and cooling of micromirrors. We derived the forces on an atom arising from its interaction\nwith the light field, as well as an estimate for the equilibrium temperature an ensemble of atoms is expected to\nreach through this interaction. In the case of optical molasses, which corresponds to the well-known Doppler temperature limit, the theory provides for additional force\nand diffusion terms related to the effect of the back-action\nof the atom on the radiation field. Although for single\natoms in free space this back-action is feeble, it is responsible for the modification of equilibrium properties\n[30, 31] and for collective effects in large optical lattices\n[32]. In the latter cases of a moving scatterer in front of\na fixed mirror, our results are valid for arbitrary scattering strength, i.e., spanning the parameter range from a\nsingle atom to high-reflectivity mirror.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported by the UK Engineering\nand Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) grant\nEP/E058949/1, by the Cavity-Mediated Molecular Cooling working group within the EuroQUAM programme of\nthe European Science Foundation (ESF) and by the National Scientific Research Fund of Hungary (NF68736,\nT049234).\n\nAPPENDIX A: THE DOPPLER-SHIFT\nOPERATOR\n\nnumber, written separately as:\nAB (k) = a1 B(k + 2k vc ) , and\nAC (k) = a2 C(k) .\nWe can therefore express A(k) as\nA(k) = a1 B(k + 2k vc ) + a2 C(k) .\nDefining P\u0302v by P\u0302v : f (k) 7\u2192 f (k + k vc ), we have\nA(k) = P\u03022v a1 B(k) + a2 C(k) .\nA similar expression, involving P\u0302v\u22121 = P\u0302\u2212v , holds for\nD(k). These two operators can then be introduced\ninto Eq. (3) as part of the Lorentz transformation, and\nthus into the transfer matrix for the moving scatterer,\ngiving rise to the form shown in Eq. (7). The resulting\ntransformation, for the transfer matrix M , of a scatterer\nmoving with velocity v can be written as:\n\u0014\n\u0015 \u0014\n\u0015\n0\n0\n(1 \u2212 vc )P\u0302v\n(1 + vc )P\u0302v\u22121\nM\n,\n0\n(1 + vc )P\u0302v\u22121\n0\n(1 \u2212 vc )P\u0302v\nto first order in vc , where the ordering of the elements of\nM is as described in the text. Note that this relation is\ngeneral, in the sense that the elements of M can depend\non k (see section II E).\nFor any finite v, P\u0302v is trivially a bounded operator,\nhaving unit norm.\nThis property\nR\nR follows from the important relation P\u0302vm f (k) dk = f (k) dk, for any function\nf (k) and any integer m.\nThis operation can be generalized to n = 2, 3 dimensions. We define a new operator by \u015ci (v) : f (k) 7\u2192\nf (k + ki vci ei ), where ei is the unit vector along the ith\ncoordinate axis, v is the velocity vector of the scatterer,\nand x = (x1 , x2 , . . . ) for any vector x. In particular, we\nhave P\u0302v = \u015c1 (ve1 ). Now, let L\u0302(v) be the 2n \u00d7 2n matrix\noperator:\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n0\n0\n***\n(1 + vc1 )\u015c1\u22121 (v)\n\uf8ef\n0\n(1 \u2212 vc1 )\u015c1 (v)\n0\n* * *\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\u22121\n.\nv2\n\uf8ef\n)\n\u015c\n(v)\n* * *\uf8fa\n0\n0\n(1\n+\n\uf8fb\n2\n\uf8f0\nc\n..\n...\n...\n...\n.\nThen, the transfer matrix for the scatterer moving with\nvelocity v is given by\nL\u0302(\u2212v) M L\u0302(v) ,\n\nFIG. 6: Reflection and transmission of a moving scatterer.\nB and C are the input field modes, and A is the output field\nmode.

The cross correlation of these operators is not trivial because of the boundary condition\nconnecting the mode amplitudes A(k), B(k), C(k) and\nD(k). The input modes \u0108(k) and B\u0302(k) can be considered independent, and the commutator is non-vanishing\nfor the creation and annihilation operators of the same\nmode, e.g.,\nh\ni h\ni\n~\u03c9\nB\u0302(k), B\u0302 \u2020 (k \u2032 ) = \u0108(k), \u0108 \u2020 (k \u2032 ) =\n\u03b4k,k\u2032 ,\n2\u01eb0 V\nh\ni\nB\u0302(k), \u0108 \u2020 (k \u2032 ) = 0 ,\n\nassuming a discrete mode index of k, and a quantisation\nvolume V = Sl with S being the mode area and l a\nfictitious total length of the space in one dimension.\nWe consider only the v = 0 case, since our expressions\nare accurate up to first order in v/c. In the quantum\ndescription, the linear relation for the output modes is\n\u221a\nA(k) = tC(k) + rB(k) + \u03b3E\n\u221a\nD(k) = rC(k) + tB(k) + \u03b3E ,\nwhere the transmission t = 1/M22 = 1/(1 \u2212 i\u03b6), and\nreflection r = M12 /M22 = i\u03b6/(1 \u2212 i\u03b6), as above. The\nfictitious amplitude E represents the quantum noise fed\n\u0001\ninto the system by the absorption. For \u03b3 = 1\u2212 |r|2 +|t|2 ,\nthis noise ensures that the output modes obey the same\ncommutation relations as the input ones, namely\nh\ni h\ni\n~\u03c9\n\u00c2(k), \u00c2\u2020 (k \u2032 ) = D\u0302(k), D\u0302\u2020 (k \u2032 ) =\n\u03b4k,k\u2032 ,\n2\u01eb0 V\ni\nh\n\u00c2(k), D\u0302\u2020 (k \u2032 ) = 0 .\n\nHowever, the linear dependence implies that commutators between input and output mode operators are\nh\ni\nh\ni\n\u00c2(k), B\u0302 \u2020 (k \u2032 ) = r B\u0302(k), B\u0302 \u2020 (k \u2032 ) ,\nh\ni\nh\ni\n\u00c2(k), \u0108 \u2020 (k \u2032 ) = t \u0108(k), \u0108 \u2020 (k \u2032 ) ,\n\nand similar relations hold for the cross-commutators with\nD(k).\nThe proper treatment of quantum fluctuations and the\nderivation of correlation functions require that the explicit time dependence be considered. Let us introduce\n\nthe time-varying operators\nX\n\u00e2(t) =\n\u00c2(k)e\u2212i\u03c9t ,\nk\n\n\u02c6\nand similarly for b\u0302(t), \u0109(t) and d(t).\nIt follows that\nh\ni\nX\n\u2032\n~\u03c9\n~\u03c9\n\u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 ) .\ne\u2212i\u03c9(t\u2212t ) \u2248\n\u00e2(t), \u00e2\u2020 (t\u2032 ) =\n2\u01eb0 V\n2\u01eb0 cS\nk\n\nHere we used that the non-excited, vacuum modes also\ncontribute to force fluctuations. Therefore the Fouriertype summation extends to a broad frequency range and\nyields a \u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 ) on the much slower timescale of interest.\nA similar commutation relation applies to the operators\n\u02c6\nb\u0302(t), \u0109(t), and d(t).\nThe cross-commutators can be derived directly from those concerning the modes, e.g.,\nh\ni\n~\u03c9\n\u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 ) .\n\u00e2(t), b\u0302\u2020 (t\u2032 ) = r\n2\u01eb0 cS\nThe force operator is\n\u0003\n\u0002\nF\u0302 = S T\u0302 xx (x \u2192 0+ ) \u2212 T\u0302 xx (x \u2192 0\u2212 ) ,\n\n(B1)\n\nas before, where\n\n\uf8f1\nh\ni\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\u22122\u01eb0 \u00e2\u2020 (t)\u00e2(t) + b\u0302\u2020 (t)b\u0302(t) x \u2192 0\u2212\nT\u0302 xx (x \u2192 0) =\nh\ni\n\uf8f4\n\u02c6\n\uf8f3\u22122\u01eb0 \u0109\u2020 (t)\u0109(t) + d\u02c6\u2020 (t)d(t)\nx \u2192 0+\n\nis the quantized stress tensor. Assuming that the field\nis in a coherent state, in all normally ordered products,\nthe mode amplitude operators can be replaced by the\ncorresponding coherent state amplitudes, which are cnumbers: e.g., \u00c2(k) \u2192 A(k) and \u00c2\u2020 (k) \u2192 A\u22c6 (k). The\nforce operator in Eq. (B1) is normally ordered in this way;\ntherefore coherent-state fields render, as a mean value of\nthe quantum expressions, the force Eq. (9) derived from\nthe classical theory based on the definition Eq. (8). Nontrivial quantum effects arise from non-normally ordered\nproducts, such as the 4th-order product terms of the\nsecond order correlation function of the force Eq. (10).\nThese terms can be evaluated straightforwardly by invoking the above-derived commutators to rearrange the\nproduct into normal order. As an example, consider\n\u00e2\u2020 (t)\u00e2(t)\u00e2\u2020 (t\u2032 )\u00e2(t\u2032 ) = \u00e2\u2020 (t)\u00e2\u2020 (t\u2032 )\u00e2(t)\u00e2(t\u2032 )\n~\u03c9\n\u2212 \u00e2\u2020 (t)\u00e2(t\u2032 )\n\u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 ) .\n2\u01eb0 cS\nFor radiation fields in coherent state, the first term is canceled from the correlation function by the h\u00e2\u2020 (t)\u00e2(t\u2032 )i2\nterm.

(11) presented in section II D.\n\n\f11\nAPPENDIX C: MIRROR COOLING VIA THE\nRADIATION PRESSURE COUPLING\nHAMILTONIAN\n\nWe describe a generic opto-mechanical system composed of a single, damped-driven field mode coupled to\nthe motion of a massive particle, whose Hamiltonian is\ngiven by [33, 34]\n\u0124 = ~\u03c9c \u00e2\u2020 \u00e2 + i~\u03b7(\u00e2\u2020 e\u2212i\u03c9t \u2212 \u00e2ei\u03c9t )\n+\n\np\u03022\n+ V (x\u0302) + ~G\u00e2\u2020 \u00e2x\u0302 .\n2m\n\nwhere \u00e2 and \u00e2\u2020 are the annihilation and creation operators of the mode, x\u0302 and p\u0302 are the position and momentum operators associated with the motion and we drop\nthe carets to signify expectation values. The mode is\ndriven by a coherent field with an effective amplitude \u03b7\nand frequency \u03c9. This Hamiltonian describes, for example, the radiation pressure coupling of a moving mirror to\nthe field in a Fabry-Perot resonator. In this case the coupling constant is G = \u03c9c /L, rendering the cavity mode\nfrequency detuning \u03c9c x/L provided the mirror is shifted\nby an amount x. Since the cavity mode is lossy with a\nphoton escape rate of 2\u03ba, the total system is dissipative.\nThereby, with a proper setting of the parameters, in particular the cavity detuning \u2206C = \u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9C , the mirror motion can be cooled. We will determine the corresponding\nfriction force linear in velocity.\nIn a frame rotating at frequency \u03c9, the Heisenberg\nequation of motion for the field mode amplitude reads\n\nthe field mode to relax to its steady-state. The variation of \u00e2 arises from the explicit time dependence and\nfrom the motion of the mirror. A steady-state solution is\nsought in the form of \u00e2 \u2248 \u00e2(0) (x) + v\u00e2(1) (x). On replacing this expansion into the above equation, and using the\n\u2202\n\u2202\nd\n\u2192 \u2202t\n+ v \u2202x\n, one obtains a\nhydrodynamic derivative dt\nhierarchy of equations of different orders of the velocity\nv. To zeroth order the adiabatic field is obtained as\na(0) =\n\n\u03b7\n.\n\u2212i(\u2206C \u2212 Gx) + \u03ba\n\nThe linear response of a to the mirror motion is then\n1\n\u2202 (0)\na\ni(\u2206C \u2212 Gx) \u2212 \u03ba \u2202x\ni\u03b7G\n=\u0002\n\u00033 .\n\u2212 i(\u2206C \u2212 Gx) + \u03ba\n\na(1) =\n\nThe force acting on the mirror derives from the defining\nequation p\u0302 \u0307 = ~i [\u0124, p\u0302] = \u2212~G\u00e2\u2020 \u00e2. The force linear in\nvelocity is\n\nwhere the noise term is omitted. We assume that the\nmirror moves along the trajectory x(t) \u2248 x + vt with\nfixed velocity v during the short time that is needed for\n\nn\no\n~\u03b7 2 G2 \u03ba\u2206C\nF 1 = \u22122v~G Re a(0)\u22c6 a(1) = 4v \u0002\n\u00033 ,\n\u22062C + \u03ba2\nwhere we used x = 0 without loss of generality. It can\nbe seen that mirror cooling requires that \u2206C < 0, i.e.,\nthe cavity resonance frequency is above the pump frequency. In this case, for efficient excitation of the field in\nthe resonator, the frequency of the pump photons is upshifted at the expense of the mirror's kinetic energy. This\ncooling force has been derived in section V, as a limiting\ncase of the more general scattering theory. To check the\nperfect agreement between the two results, the quantity\ncorresponding to \u03b7 can be deduced from the total field\nenergy in the resonator for an immobile mirror, which is\n~\u03c9C \u00e2(0)\u2020 \u00e2(0) here.\n\n[1] T.

The\ncooling relies on the dipole force and thus in principle applies to arbitrary refractive particles including atoms, molecules, or dielectric spheres. Friction and equilibrium temperatures are derived\nby an analytic perturbative approach. Finally, semiclassical Monte-Carlo simulations are performed\nto validate the analytic results.\nPACS numbers: 37.10.De, 37.10.Vz, 42.50.Wk\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nOptical cooling of atoms has come a long way since it\nwas first proposed; magneto\u2013optical traps are even found\nin undergraduate laboratories [1, 2, 3]. The field of ultracold molecules, in contrast, is still in its infancy. Ultracold diatomic alkali molecules (< 100 \u03bcK for Rb2 [4])\nare routinely produced from Bose-Einstein condensates\nthrough Feshbach resonances. Some groups (see, for example, [5] and [6]) have demonstrated the possibility of\ncooling the internal degrees of such molecules, cooling ultracold di-alkali molecules to their lowest rovibronic levels by means of laser-stimulated state transfer processes.\nPresent methods of producing ultracold samples suffer\nfrom one of two major drawbacks: either they are specific\nto particular species, or they produce very low densities.\nThe bulk of optical cooling methods are applicable only\nto a handful of species because they rely on a closed optical transition within which the population can cycle [7].\nMost atoms and molecules do not have such a transition available, but instead exhibit a large number of loss\nchannels through which the population is gradually lost,\nhalting the cooling. Samples of cold molecules are therefore generally produced by capturing the low-velocity tail\nof the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of a hotter initial\nsample [8]. However, such filtering methods do not lead\nto an increase of the phase-space density and thus only\ncapture a small fraction of the initial population, leading\nto very dilute samples.\nOne possibility to solve this problem is through the use\nof non-resonant processes [9] or cavities [10, 11, 12, 13,\n14]. The latter require extremely high precision alignment of the cavity mirrors as well as complicated loading\nof the molecules into the optical cavity mode. The requirements for integrated systems near the surface of a\nsubstrate in the form of atom chips [15] are even more\nstringent.\nHere, we investigate a mechanism for the cooling of\n\na particle using only a single plane mirror in place of a\ncavity. In principle, this scheme only relies on the dipole\nforce of a refractive particle in a laser beam and thus\napplies to a wide range of atomic and molecular species\nas well as, for example, dielectric micro- or nanospheres.\nHowever, in the present work we focus on the basic principles of the cooling scheme and thus restrict the analysis\nto the simplest case of a two-level atom.\nConceptually, one can view the interaction between the\natom and the mirror as being closely related to that between a micromechanical oscillator, acting as a mobile\nmirror, and a second mirror. Such schemes have been investigated both theoretically [16, 17] and experimentally\n[18, 19] in various configurations.\nAlthough we have recently shown that one can treat\nthese two situations as two opposite limits of the same\nmodel [20], the situation we explore here behaves differently, and this can be attributed to two facts. Firstly,\nthe coupling strength between the static and moving\nscatterer (atom or mirror) is very different in the two\ncases: an atom merely perturbs the field it interacts with,\nwhereas a mirror acts as a moving boundary condition\nand changes the field significantly. Secondly, the effect\nwe investigate here is only dominant at large atom\u2013mirror\nseparations. Thus, our proposed cooling scheme operates\nin a parameter regime that is as yet mostly unexplored.\nThis paper is structured as follows. In the next section\nwe introduce the key features of our system and propose\na simple classical explanation of the cooling scheme. In\nsection III the relevant quantum equations of motion are\nintroduced. Section IV solves these equations of motion\nanalytically through the use of perturbative methods,\nwhereas section V gives the results of numerical simulations used to explore the implications of the theory in\nfurther detail. Section VI compares our results with those\nof traditional Doppler cooling, and finally section VII\nsummarizes and concludes our discussion.\n\nII.\n\u2217 To whom all correspondence should be addressed.

(a) In the laboratory frame, an atom moving with velocity v parallel to\na mirror, a distance \u03c4 c away, interacts with a pump beam\nand its time-delayed reflection. (b) In the frame of the atom,\nthe (relativistically transformed) pump beam and its reflection are tilted by an angle \u03b8 = arcsin(v/c) and produce a net\nretarding force, F .\n\nmodel presented in the next section. The phenomenon of\noptical binding has been known for some time (see, for\nexample, [21, 22, 23]) and is now a common occurrence.\nAt a basic level, optical binding takes place between two\ndielectric spheres when one sphere focuses the light onto\na second sphere, which is subsequently trapped. If we\nnow consider just one such sphere in front of a mirror,\nthe modified electric field will be reflected back towards\nthe sphere itself. In essence, then, the sphere will be attracted to its own image. However, this interaction is\ndelayed by the time 2\u03c4 it takes the disturbance in the\nelectric field to travel from the sphere to the mirror and\nback, where \u03c4 is the time that light from the atom takes\nto reach the mirror. Suppose, now, that the sphere is\nmoving parallel to the plane of the mirror with velocity\nv, as shown in Fig. 1(a). In this case, the sphere moves a\ndistance 2v\u03c4 during the light roundtrip time. Thus, the\ndisturbed light field lags behind the particle and creates\nan attractive force in the direction opposite to the motion of the particle. This attractive force can be shown\nto be a viscous force, i.e., it is proportional to v. This\nscenario also applies to the case of a single atom interacting with an off-resonant beam, where the atom can\neffectively be modeled as a refractive particle. Note that\nthe interaction between a single atom and its image in a\ndistant mirror has already been demonstrated [24, 25].\nAlternatively, we may consider the same situation in\nthe reference frame of the moving particle, as shown in\nFig. 1(b). In this case both the incident laser beam and\nits reflection are tilted by an angle \u03b8 = arcsin(v/c) with\nrespect to normal incidence on the mirror. The sum potential is therefore offset from the particle position by an\namount proportional to its velocity, leading again to a\nvelocity-dependent force opposing the motion.\nSimilar arguments apply for a particle moving along\nthe direction of the pump beam, i.e., orthogonal to the\nmirror. In this case, the phase of the reflected beam is\ndetermined by the interaction of the particle with the\npump at the earlier time 2\u03c4 . In effect, the atom exerts\na delayed phase change on the light field, dragging the\npotential along with itself while moving and thus creating\na non-conservative force. This effect is similar to the\n\nFIG. 2: Schematic representation of the key components of\nthe system under consideration. The atom is separated from\nthe mirror by a distance \u03c4 c and lies in a standing wave maintained by the pump beam.\n\n\"position dependent phase locking\" described in [26].\nIII.\n\nMATHEMATICAL MODEL\n\nIn order to analyze the principles of the proposed cooling scheme most clearly, we simplify the situation described above to a one-dimensional (1D) scheme and assume a single two-level atom as the particle to be cooled.\nA schematic of the system is shown in Fig. 2.\nThe atom has a transition frequency \u03c9a and a decay\nrate 2\u0393 and is described by the operators p\u0302 and x\u0302 associated with the atomic momentum and position, respectively, and by the atomic dipole raising (\u03c3\u0302 + ) and lowering (\u03c3\u0302 \u2212 ) operators. The atom is coupled to a continuum\nof quantized electro-magnetic modes with frequencies \u03c9\nand standing-wave mode functions f (\u03c9, x) = sin(\u03c9x/c),\ndescribed by the field annihilation \u00e2(\u03c9) and creation operators \u00e2\u2020 (\u03c9). The mirror is at position x = 0. For\nsimplicity, we neglect the frequency-dependence of the\natom-field coupling and assume a single coupling coefficient g. Finally, mode \u03c90 is pumped by a laser, which\nenters our analysis as an initial condition, and far off resonant pumping is assumed, |\u2206| = |\u03c9a \u2212 \u03c90 | \u226b \u0393, where\nthe atom mainly acts as a refractive particle and spontaneous scattering is reduced. For the numerical examples\ngiven in this paper, we consider 85 Rb atoms and a realistic pump beam that is detuned from the 5S1/2 \u2192 5P3/2\ntransition of 85 Rb by several linewidths.\nThe starting point for describing the coupling between\nthe atom and the field modes is the quantum master\nequation:\ni\nih\n\u03c1\u0302 \u0307 = \u2212 \u0124, \u03c1\u0302 + L\u03c1\u0302,\n(1)\n~\nwhere \u03c1\u0302 is the density operator of the full system comprising all modes and the atom. Applying the dipole and\nrotating wave approximations and in a frame rotating\nwith the driving frequency \u03c90 , the Hamiltonian \u0124 reads\nZ\np\u03022\n\u0124 =\n+ ~\u2206\u03c3\u0302 + \u03c3\u0302 \u2212 ~(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c90 )\u00e2\u2020 (\u03c9)\u00e2(\u03c9) d\u03c9\n2m\nZ\n\u2212 i~g [\u03c3\u0302 + \u00e2(\u03c9)f (\u03c9, x\u0302) \u2212 h.c.] d\u03c9,\n(2)\n\n\f3\nand the damping term associated with atomic decay into\nmodes other than the 1D system modes reads\n\u0014\nL\u03c1\u0302 = \u2212\u0393 \u03c3\u0302 + \u03c3\u0302 \u2212 \u03c1\u0302 + \u03c1\u0302\u03c3\u0302 + \u03c3\u0302 \u2212\n\u2212 2\n\nZ\n\n1\n\n\u22121\n\n\u0015\nN (u)\u03c3\u0302 \u2212 e\u2212iux\u0302 \u03c1\u0302eiux\u0302 \u03c3\u0302 + du .\n\n(3)\n\nHere N (u) describes the 1D projection of the spontaneous emission pattern of the atomic dipole. In the low\nsaturation regime we can adiabatically eliminate the internal atomic dynamics and formally express the dipole\noperator as\nZ\ni\u2206 + \u0393\ng\nf (\u03c9, x\u0302)\u00e2(\u03c9) d\u03c9 + \u03be\u0302 \u2212 ,\n(4)\n\u03c3\u0302 \u2212 = \u2212 2\n\u2206 + \u03932\n\nwhere \u03be\u02c6\u2212 is a noise term [27].\nIn the following, we present two different ways of proceeding from this point. In the first instance we approximate further and use perturbation theory to derive the\nforce experienced by the atom analytically, in section IV,\nand in the second instance we derive semiclassical equations of motion. The latter approach is then applied to\nnumerical simulations of the situation in section V.\nIV. ANALYZING THE MODEL: A\nPERTURBATIVE APPROACH\nA.\n\nWe first derive an analytical approximation for the friction on the atom. To this end, we treat atomic motion\nsemiclassically and thus replace the operator x\u0302 by an\natomic position x. After inserting Eq. (4) into Eq. (2)\nand Eq. (3), we obtain the Hamiltonian\nZ\n\u0124 = ~(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c90 )\u00e2\u2020 (\u03c9)\u00e2(\u03c9) d\u03c9 + ~g 2 D(\u2206)\nZZ\n\u00d7\nsin(\u03c91 x/c) sin(\u03c92 x/c)\u00e2\u2020 (\u03c91 )\u00e2(\u03c92 ) d\u03c91 d\u03c92 ,\n\nwhere we have defined D(\u2206) = \u2206/(\u22062 +\u03932 ). As a consequence of the assumed large pump detuning \u2206, we in the\nfollowing neglect that part of the decay term L\u03c1\u0302 which\nleads to spontaneous scattering of photons between the\nquantized modes by the atom.\nLet us first consider a stationary atom at a fixed position x = x0 . Starting with the Heisenberg equation of\nmotion for the annihilation operators\ni\nih\nd\n\u0124, \u00e2(\u03c9, t) ,\n\u00e2(\u03c9, t) =\ndt\n~\nwe arrive at the integro-differential equation\n\n\u2212 ig 2 D(\u2206) sin(\u03c9x/c)\n\nsin(\u03c91 x/c)\u00e2(\u03c91 , t) d\u03c91 .\n\nn\n\nwith an (\u03c9, t) being the nth coefficient of the series expansion. Solving Eq. (5) by perturbation theory then yields\nthe zeroth order term in g 2 D(\u2206)\na0 (\u03c9, t) = A\u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c90 ),\n\n(7)\n\nand the first order term\na1 (\u03c9, t) = A\n\nexp [\u2212i(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c90 )t] \u2212 1\nsin(\u03c9x/c) sin(\u03c90 x/c).\n\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c90\n\nWe now proceed to find, to second order in g 2 D(\u2206), the\nstatic force, F (x0 , t) = \u2212\u2202 \u0124/\u2202x, acting on the atom:\n\u001a\n~\n|A|2 g 2 D(\u2206)\u03c90 sin(2\u03c90 x0 /c)\nc\n\u001b\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03c0 2\n\u2212 g D(\u2206) sin2 (\u03c90 x0 /c) 4 cos2 (\u03c90 x0 /c) \u2212 1 .\n2\n\nF (x0 , t) =\n\nFriction force\n\nd\n\u00e2(\u03c9, t) = \u2212 i(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c90 )\u00e2(\u03c9, t)\ndt\nZ\n\nWe now assume coherent states at all times for the fields\nand replace the operators with their respective expectation values. Since we are pumping the atom at a single frequency, we take the initial condition a(\u03c9, 0) =\nA\u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c90 ), where A is the amplitude of the pump field,\nsuch that |A|2 is the pump power in units of photons per\nsecond, and \u03b4 is the Dirac \u03b4-function. We now expand\nthe fields a(\u03c9, t) in the weak-coupling limit in powers of\nthe coupling constant,\nX\na(\u03c9, t) =\nan (\u03c9, t)[g 2 D(\u2206)]n ,\n(6)\n\n(5)\n\nThe first term in the above equation describes the interaction of the atom with the unperturbed pump field,\nwhereas the second term is the lowest order correction of\nthe force due to the back-action of the atom on the light\nfields. Note that this force is independent of time.\nSimilarly, we can now calculate the force on an atom\nmoving at a constant velocity v. For this we assume that\nthe atom follows a trajectory given by x(t) = x0 + v(t \u2212\nt0 ), where t0 is a long enough time for the system to\nreach a stationary state, i.e., t0 is larger than twice the\npropagation time \u03c4 = x0 /c of the light from the atom to\nthe mirror. We can then solve Eq. (5) up to first order in\nboth v and g 2 D(\u2206). The friction force in the longitudinal\ndirection is finally obtained as\nF k (x0 , t) =\n\n\u0002\n\u00032\n2\u03c0~\u03c90\nv|A|2 g 2 D(\u2206) sin2 (2k0 x0 )\nc2\n\u0002\n\u00032\n2\u03c0~\u03c9 2\n\u2212 2 0 v\u03c4 |A|2 g 2 D(\u2206) sin(4k0 x0 ).(8)\nc\n\nThe second term in Eq. (8) is larger than the first by a\nfactor of the order k0 x0 = \u03c90 x0 /c and is therefore dominant if the distance of the atom from the mirror is much\nlarger than an optical wavelength.

Parameters are for Rb atoms and\n|A|2 = 62.5\u0393/(2\u03c0), \u2206 = \u221210\u0393, \u03c4 = 0.25/\u0393, w = 0.7 \u03bcm.\n\nSupposing that the species we are cooling is 85 Rb, and\nsetting |A|2 = 62.5\u0393/(2\u03c0), \u2206 = \u221210\u0393, \u03c4 = 0.25/\u0393, and\nGaussian beam waist w = 0.7 \u03bcm, Eq. (9) predicts 1/e\ncooling times of the order of 2 ms. The value for \u03c4 that\nwe use implies a separation between the atom and the\nmirror of the order of several metres. We suggest that\nthis problem can be overcome through the coupling of the\nlight into an optical fibre, thereby avoiding the effects of\ndiffraction. A recent experiment making use of a similar\ntechnique is described in [28].\nEquation (9) indicates an exponential decay or increase\nin velocity. We define the heating coefficient \u03a5 of an ensemble of atoms as the proportionality constant in the\nrelation dp2 /dt = \u03a5p2 , which thus depends on position\nas sin(4k0 x0 ). Moreover, since p2 \u221d T for a thermal ensemble, we also have dT /dt = \u03a5T . Figure 3 shows a plot\nof \u03a5 against atomic position, where we introduced the\ncoordinate x\u20320 relative to the nearest node of the standing wave pump. It is only in certain intervals that we\nexpect the longitudinal force to be a damping force, as\nindicated in this figure by the shaded regions.\nWe now derive the friction force in the transverse direction, i.e., orthogonal to the pump beam. In this\ncase the coupling constant g becomes a function g(r),\nwhere r is the coordinate in the transverse direction.\nFor an atom moving at small constant velocity, we may\nwrite g[r0 + v(t \u2212 t0 )] \u2248 g(r0 ) + v(t \u2212 t0 )g \u2032 (r0 ) where\ng \u2032 (r) = dg/dr. Substituting this in Eq. (5) we can derive\nan expression for the friction force, F \u22a5 (x0 , t) = \u2212\u2202 \u0124/\u2202r,\nin the direction of r:\n\u00132\n\u0012\n2gg \u2032 \u2206\nF \u22a5 (x0 , t0 ) = \u22124\u03c0~v\u03c4 |A|2\n\u22062 + \u03932\n\u00d7 sin3 (k0 x0 ) cos(k0 x0 ).\n\nThis transverse friction force is also shown in Fig. 3 as-\n\nsuming a Gaussian mode function of waist w = 0.7\u03bcm.\nNote that F k and F \u22a5 are comparable in magnitude for\nthe parameters chosen here where the mode waist is comparable to the optical wavelength, and that there exist\nregions where both these forces promote cooling.\nIn the remainder of this paper, however, we will concentrate on a one-dimensional treatment of the problem\nand therefore only consider the longitudinal friction force.\nThis could correspond, for example, to the imaging arrangement of Eschner at al. [24].\nIn terms of more familiar parameters, we can\nrewrite Eq. (9) in the limit |\u2206| \u226b \u0393 as\nF k (x0 , t) = \u22124vs\u0393\n\n\u03c3a\n~k 2 \u03c4 sin(4k0 x0 ),\n\u03c0w2 0\n\n(10)\n\nwhere s = g 2 |A|2 /(\u22062 + \u03932 ) is the maximum saturation parameter of the atom in the standing wave, \u03c3a =\n3\u03bb2 /(2\u03c0) is the atomic radiative cross-section, and where\nwe used the relation 2\u03c0g 2 /\u0393 = 4\u03c3a /(\u03c0w2 ).\nAside from allowing us to make predictions of cooling\ntimes, Eq. (9) and Eq. (10) also highlight the dependence\nof this cooling effect on the variation of certain physical\nparameters. In particular, F k depends on the square of\nthe detuning, which means that it is possible to obtain\ncooling with both positive and negative detuning. The\nfriction force also scales with w\u22124 and |A|2 . Hence, for a\nfixed laser intensity, proportional to |A|2 /w2 , i.e., fixed\natomic saturation, friction still scales with w\u22122 and thus\na tight focus is needed in order to have a sizeable effect.\nA very promising feature of these two equations is the\nlinear dependence of the cooling rate on \u03c4 . In section V\nwe further analyze the dependence of the cooling rate\non the various parameters and support the validity of\nthe analytic solution by comparing it with the results of\nsimulations.\n\nB.\n\nLocalizing the particle\n\nEquation (9) shows that, in order to observe any cooling effects, we need to localize the particle within around\n\u03bb/8. This can be achieved, for example, by an additional\nfar-off resonant and tightly focused laser beam propagating parallel to the mirror forming a dipole trap centered\nat a point x0 . We characterize this trap by means of its\nspring constant kt , such that the trapping force is given\nby Ft = \u2212kt (x \u2212 x0 ), orp\nequivalently by the harmonic\noscillator frequency \u03c9t = (kt /m), where m is the mass\nof the atom.\nIf we now assume that the atom oscillates as x(t) =\nx0 + xm sin[\u03c9t (t \u2212 t0 )] in the trap with a maximum distance xm of the particle from the trap center and a corresponding maximum velocity vm , it is possible to derive\na new friction coefficient by perturbation theory in xm .\n\n\f5\nProceeding along the lines of section IV A, we arrive at\n\n\u00d7 |A|2\n\n\u0012\n\nsinc(2\u03c9t \u03c4 )\n\u00132\ng \u2206\nsin(4k0 x0 ) .\n\u22062 + \u03932\n\n4\n\n2\n\n(11)\n\nNote that this formula reduces to Eq. (9) in the limit of\nsmall wt . The sinusoidal dependence on \u03c9t \u03c4 can be explained in an intuitive manner: the effect on the particle\nis unchanged if the particle undergoes an integer number\nof oscillations in the round-trip time 2\u03c4 .\nWhile Eq. (11) was derived for an oscillating particle,\nit is still only correct to lowest order in xm and therefore\ndoes not include the effect of a finite spatial distribution.\nIn order to obtain an estimate for the friction force in the\npresence of spatial broadening, we calculate the overall\nenergy loss rate experienced by the particle in terms of\nthe time average of Eq. (9):\n\u001c 2\u001d\n\u00132\n\u0012\ndp\n2~k02 p20\ng2\u2206\n= \u2212\n\u03c4 |A|2\ndt\nm\n\u22062 + \u03932\nZ 2\u03c0\n\u00d7\nsin[4k0 x0 + 4k0 xm sin(T )] cos2 (T ) dT , (12)\n0\n\nwhere p0 = mvm is the maximum momentum\nof the par\u221a\nticle in the trap given by p0 = xm mkt . The value of\nthe integral in (12) can be expressed as\n2\u03c0\n[sin(4k0 x0 )J1 (4k0 xm ) + cos(4k0 x0 )H1 (4k0 xm )],\n4k0 xm\nwhere J1 is the order-1 Bessel function of the first kind\nand H1 is the order-1 Struve function [29]. At the point\nof maximum friction, x\u20320 = \u22123\u03bb/16, the integral in the\nabove equation reduces to 2\u03c0J1 (4k0 xm )/(4k0 xm ) which\ncan be readily evaluated.\nFor small values of xm , the effect of this averaging process is to introduce a factor of one half into Eq. (11),\nwhich can be seen as being equivalent to the effect of\ncooling merely one degree of freedom when the atom is\nin a harmonic trap. Finally, Eq. (12) is modified similarly\nto Eq. (11) to include the effects of the harmonic oscillation by replacing \u03c4 \u2192 sin(2\u03c9t \u03c4 )/(2\u03c9t ). This results in an\napproximate expression for the friction, taking into account the periodicity in the time delay as well as spatial\naveraging effects,\n\u0012\n\u00132\ng2\u2206\nF k (x0 , t) = \u2212 ~k02 vm \u03c4 |A|2\nsinc(2\u03c9t \u03c4 )\n\u22062 + \u03932\nZ 2\u03c0\n\u00d7\nsin[4k0 x0 + 4k0 xm sin(T )] cos2 (T ) dT .\n0\n\n(13)\n\nC.\n\nCapture range\n\nAs discussed above, the addition of the dipole trap\nintroduces several features into the friction force.

Other parameters are as in Fig. 3. Cooling is achieved\nonly for a finite range of initial momenta.\n\nthe particle's initial momentum, as in Fig. 4, shows that\nthe force changes sign for high enough initial momentum.\nThis is due to the broader spatial distribution for faster\nparticles in the harmonic trap. For fast enough velocities, the particle oscillates into the heating regions, as\nshown in Fig. 3, even if the trap is centered at the position of maximum cooling. This defines a range of initial\nmomenta, starting from zero, within which a particle is\ncooled by this mechanism; faster particles are heated and\nejected from the trap. Note that this result was derived\nfrom the friction to lowest order in velocity v, and higher\norder terms are expected to affect the capture range further.\nAt particular values of x\u20320 , e.g. at \u22123\u03bb/16, this capture\nrange can be conveniently estimated by using the location\nof the first zero of the Bessel function,\np\np0 \u2248 0.958 (mkt )/k0 = 0.958m\u03c9t/k0 .\n(14)\n\nThus, p20 \u221d \u03c9t2 , and the capture range as defined in Fig. 4\nis expected to scale with the square of the trap frequency.\nWe compare this later in section V with the results of\nnumerical simulations.\nD.\n\nDiffusion and steady-state temperature\n\nIn the preceding discussion we found a friction force\nwhich cools an atom towards zero momentum. In practice, the cooling process is counteracted by momentum\ndiffusion due to spontaneous scattering by the atom of\nphotons from the pump beam into other electromagnetic\nmodes and between the two counterpropagating components of the standing wave pump itself. In a simplified\nBrownian motion model, this diffusion introduces a constant in the equation for dp2 /dt, resulting in a constant\nupward shift of the curve in Fig. 4. This slightly reduces the capture range for fast particles, but its main\n\n\f6\nDoppler cooling, kB T = ~\u0393, but where \u0393 is replaced\nby the inverse of the atom\u2013mirror delay time, 1/\u03c4 , and\nwhere a geometrical factor related to the mode area divided by the atomic cross section is included.\n\nSteady-state temperature (mK)\n\n3.0\n\n2.5\n\n2.0\n\n1.5\n\nV.\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.0\n0\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.6\n\n-0.8\n\n-1\n\nAtom position, x\u20320 (\u03bb)\n\nFIG. 5: Calculated steady-state temperature TM for an atom\nconfined in a harmonic trap as a function of position whilst\nkeeping the detuning and pump field constant. \u03c9t = 0.1\u00d72\u03c0\u0393;\nother parameters are as in Fig. 3.\n\neffect is to introduce a specific value of the momentum where friction and diffusion exactly compensate each\nother. This point corresponds to the steady-state temperature achievable through the cooling mechanism discussed here.\nTo lowest order in the coupling coefficient g 2 , the diffusion is given by the interaction of the atom with the\nunperturbed, standing-wave pump field. In this limit,\ndiffusion in our system is therefore identical to that of\nDoppler cooling [30, 31, 32, 33], where the diffusion coefficient D is given to lowest order in s by\nh\ni\nD = ~2 k02 \u0393s cos2 (k0 x0 ) + 25 sin2 (k0 x0 ) .\n(15)\n\nThe steady-state temperature TM of mirror-mediated\ncooling is then obtained from kB TM = Dvm /F k (x0 , t)\nwhere F k (x0 , t) is the friction force given by Eq. (11).\nFor |\u2206| >> \u0393 we find\nTM =\n\n1 ~ \u03c9t \u0393 2 + 3 cos2 (k0 x0 )\n.\n5\u03c0 kB g 2 sin(2\u03c9t \u03c4 ) sin(4k0 x0 )\n\n(16)\n\nAn example of the dependence of TM on the trap position\nis shown in Fig. 5, predicting a minimum temperature of\nthe order of 400 \u03bcK. Whilst this may seem large in comparison to the Doppler temperature of 141 \u03bcK, one has\nto keep in mind that TM , given by Eq. (16), is insensitive to detuning and, for far off-resonant operation of the\norder of tens of linewidths, it will be the dominant mechanism. This is further discussed in section VI. We also\nnote that Fig. 5 further highlights the importance of the\nrequirement for localizing the particle. Using Eq. (10)\nwe can approximate the steady-state temperature at the\npoint of maximum friction by\n~ \u03c0w\n.\n\u03c4 8\u03c3a\n\nNUMERICAL SIMULATIONS\n\nIn this section we now investigate a more accurate\nnumerical model to corroborate the simplified analytical results obtained above. In order to render the problem numerically tractable, the continuum of modes is replaced by a discrete set of modes with frequencies \u03c9k ,\nk = 1, . . . , N . The master equation (1) is then converted\nby use of the Wigner transform into a Fokker-Planck\nequation for the atomic and field variables. Applying\na semiclassical approximation and restricting the equation of motion to second-order derivatives, one arrives\nat an equivalent set of stochastic differential equations\nfor a single atom with momentum p and position x in a\ndiscrete multimode field with mode amplitudes \u03b1k [34],\np\ndt,\nm\u0002\n\u0003\nd\nd \u22c6\nE (x) \u2212 E \u22c6 (x) dx\nE(x) dt\ndp = i\u03b3 E(x) dx\n\u0002\n\u0003\nd \u22c6\nd\n\u2212 U0 E(x) dx\nE (x) + E \u22c6 (x) dx\nE(x) dt\n\ndx =\n\n(17a)\n\n\u2212 kt (x \u2212 xt )dt + dP ,\n(17b)\n\u22c6\nd\u03b1k = i\u2206k \u03b1k dt \u2212 (iU0 + \u03b3)E(x)fk (x)dt + dAk , (17c)\nwhere fk (x) = sin(\u03c9k x/c) are the mode functions, E(x) =\nP\nk \u03b1k fk (x) is the total electric field, \u2206k = \u03c90 \u2212 \u03c9k is the\ndetuning of each mode from the pump, U0 is the light\nshift per photon, and \u03b3 is the photon scattering rate.\nThe terms dP and dAk are correlated noise terms [34]\nresponsible for momentum and field diffusion.\nIn the following, we set the trap center to x\u20320 =\n\u22123\u03bb/16, which is the point where the analytic solution\npredicts the maximum of the damping force. We use\nN = 256 field modes with a mode spacing of \u0393/10. At\nthe start of every simulation, all field modes are empty\nwith the exception of the pump mode which is initialized\nat 625 photons, corresponding to a laser power of around\n50 pW for our chosen parameters.\nThe simulations were performed in runs of several\nthousand trajectories. Each such run was performed at\na well-defined initial temperature, with the starting momenta of the particles chosen from a Gaussian distribution, and the starting position being the center of the\ntrap.\n\nA.\n\nFriction force and capture range\n\n2\n\nkB TM \u2248\n\nIt is interesting to note that this expression is closely related to the expression for the limiting temperature in\n\nFig. 6 presents the results of a set of simulations performed when setting the noise terms dP and dAk in equations (17a) to zero, i.e., neglecting momentum and photon number diffusion.

(13).\nFor modest values of \u03c9t , Fig. 6(a) justifies the averaging process used to derive (12) which was based on spatial averaging but neglecting higher order terms in v. In\ncontrast, for larger trap frequencies, the numerical simulations diverge significantly from the analytic result, as\ncan be seen in Fig. 6(b). We expect that the terms in\nhigher powers of the initial speed, which were dropped\nin the perturbative solution, are responsible for this discrepancy.\nWe have already seen, in Eq. (14), that the capture\nrange is expected to scale as \u03c9t2 . For weak traps, as\nshown in Fig. 7, the numerical simulations agree well\nwith these expectations. For stiffer traps, however, the\ncapture range is consistently larger than that predicted;\nin fact, the simulations predict a capture range of around\n450 mK for a trap frequency of 0.5 \u00d7 2\u03c0\u0393\nB.\n\nSteady-state temperature\n\nThe next step in our investigation was to run simulations involving the full dynamics given by Eqs. (17a)\n\nFIG. 8: Heating rate (dT /dt) extracted from the simulations\nstarting at a number of initial temperatures. The solid line\nrepresents a quadratic fit to the data. \u03c9t = 0.5 \u00d7 2\u03c0\u0393; other\nparameters are as in Fig. 6.\n\nincluding the diffusion terms. Because of the discrete\nnature of the field modes with uniform frequency spacing used in the simulations, the numerically modeled\nbehavior is always periodic in time with a periodicity\ngiven by the inverse of the frequency spacing. The simulations therefore cannot follow each trajectory to its\nsteady-state. Instead, simulations were performed in several groups of trajectories, each group forming a thermal\nensemble at a well-defined initial temperature. For each\nsuch group of trajectories the initial value of dT /dt was\ncalculated. The results for \u03c9t = 0.5 \u00d7 2\u03c0\u0393 are shown in\nFig. 8, where the error bars are due to statistical fluctuations for a finite number of stochastic integrations. The\nsteady-state temperature is that temperature at which\ndT /dt = 0 as clearly illustrated in this figure. For the\nchosen parameters, our data suggest a steady-state temperature of 722\u00b154 \u03bcK with a 1/e cooling time of around\n\n\f8\n\nSteady-state temperature (\u03bcK)\n\nSteady-state temperature, TS (\u03bcK)\n\n2000\n\n1500\n\n1000\n\n500\n\n0\n\n1000\n\n100\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n-1\n\n-10\n\nDetuning, \u2206 (\u0393)\n\nTrap frequency, \u03c9t (2\u03c0\u0393)\n\nFIG. 9: Steady-state temperature for a number of simulations\n(circles) compared to the analytic formula (16) (solid line).\nThe solid square represents the equivalent data from Fig. 8,\nresulting from a much larger number of simulations. Parameters are as in Fig. 6.\n\n3.0 ms. This compares reasonably well with the steadystate temperature of 597 \u03bcK predicted by Eq. (16).\nWe finally performed a large number of simulations\nto investigate the dependence of the steady-state temperature on the trap frequency. Equation (16) indicates\nthat as one decreases \u03c9t the steady state temperature decreases. This is clearly seen in Fig. 9, which compares the\nprediction of Eq. (16) with a set of numerical simulations.\nThe trend in the data is reproduced well by the analytic\nexpression. However, the simulated steady-state temperature is consistently a little higher than predicted. We\nexpect that this discrepancy is due to one of two reasons.\n(i) Equation (16) was derived from the friction Eq. (11),\ni.e., without the spatial averaging of (13) which would\nreduce friction. (ii) Higher order terms in the velocity\nv are also expected to reduce friction compared to the\nlowest order analytical result. In both cases, therefore,\nthe analytic expression is expected to overestimate the\nfriction force and thus to predict too low temperatures.\n\nVI.\n\nBEYOND ADIABATIC THEORY\n\nAll the theoretical analysis and simulations discussed\nso far have been based on adiabatic elimination of the internal atomic degrees of freedom, and therefore neglected\nDoppler cooling. In Fig. 10, we explore the variation of\nTM and the Doppler temperature, TD , as a function of detuning from resonance when the particle is at the point\nof greatest friction (x\u20320 = 3\u03bb/16), where TD is given by\nTD = \u2212~\u0393(\u22062 + \u03932 )/(2\u2206) for negative values of \u2206. In\nthe presence of both cooling effects, the stationary temperature achieved by the system is given by\nT =\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n1\n+\nTM\nTD\n\n\u0013\u22121\n\n.\n\n(18)\n\nFIG. 10: Comparison between the calculated steady-state\ntemperatures for mirror-mediated cooling TM (dash-dotted\nline), Doppler cooling TD (dashed), and in the presence of\nboth effects T (solid), drawn as a function of detuning whilst\nkeeping the saturation parameter constant. \u03c9t = 0.1 \u00d7 2\u03c0\u0393;\nother parameters are as in Fig. 6.\n\nThus, for the parameters of Fig. 9, the calculated steadystate temperature T reduces to 250 \u03bcK in the limit of\nvanishing \u03c9t .\nFrom Fig. 10 one can see that the mirror-mediated\nforce, for our tightly focused pump, is stronger than the\nDoppler force for detunings larger than around 10\u0393 in\nmagnitude. In practice this has two implications: for\nlarge negative detunings, we expect the steady-state temperature of the system to be significantly lower than that\npredicted by Doppler cooling; whereas for large positive\ndetunings, we still predict equilibrium temperatures of\nthe order of mK.\nBoth our perturbative expressions and our simulations\nare calculated to lowest orders in the atomic saturation.\nHowever, it is well known that in the limit of very large\ndetunings also higher order terms in the saturation parameter s become significant. Using the full expression\nfor the diffusion constant [30], we can estimate the detuning for which we expect minimum diffusion and temperature. For the value of the saturation parameter s . 0.1\nused throughout this paper, it can be shown that TM attains a minimum at detunings of up to several tens of\nlinewidths. Our chosen parameters are therefore within\nthe range of validity of the model.\nVII.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe have presented a mechanism for cooling particles\nby optical means which is based fundamentally on the\ndipole interaction of a particle with a light beam and\ntherefore does not rely on spontaneous emission. The\nparticle is assumed to be trapped and is simultaneously\ndriven by an off-resonant laser beam. After the interaction with the particle the beam is reflected back onto\nthe particle by a distant mirror. The time-delay incurred\n\n\f9\nduring the light round-trip to the mirror and back is exploited to create a non-conservative cooling force.\nThe system was analyzed using stochastic simulations\nof the semiclassical equations of motion representing a\nsingle two-level atom coupled to a continuum of electromagnetic modes. The results of these computations\nwere found to agree with the expectations of a perturbative analysis. Our models predict sub-mK steady-state\ntemperatures for 85 Rb atoms interacting with a tightly\nfocused laser beam several meters from the mirror, in\nan arrangement similar to that of Ref. [24]. While most\nof the theory is presented for a one-dimensional model,\nresults for the friction force in the transverse direction\nsuggest that three-dimensional cooling is possible with\nthis scheme.\nThe model presented here requires a large separation\nbetween the atom and the mirror, of the order of several\nmeters, for an observable cooling effect. This limitation\ncan be overcome in several ways. First, the light could\npropagate in an optical fiber between the atom and the\n\nmirror to avoid the effects of diffraction. Second, the\nrequired delayed reflection could be achieved through the\nuse of a cavity instead of a mirror; in contrast to cavitymediated cooling schemes [10, 11, 12, 13, 14], the atom\nwould remain external to the cavity. For a time delay \u03c4\nof order 1 ns one would require a cavity quality factor\nQ = \u03c9\u03c4 [35] of the order of 106 \u2212 107 , which is achievable\nwith present-day technology [36].\n\n[1] T.

The starting point for most geometries has been the original, '6-beam',\nconfiguration [1], where the atom trap is created in the intersection of three counterpropagating\nlaser beams. Despite it having the advantage that the atoms can be trapped far from any surface, thereby reducing spurious scatter in the imaging of such a trap, one cannot easily use this\nconfiguration for investigations into atom\u2013surface interactions, for precisely the same reason.\nAnother, more recent, configuration is the so-called 'mirror MOT' [5], where the trap is formed\na short distance away from a mirror, which also serves to reduce the number of necessary incident laser beam paths to two. The major drawback of such a configuration is its reduced optical\naccess, due to the oblique angle of the field coils with respect to the mirror. The presence of\na reflecting surface close to the trap also presents a problem of an entirely different nature. If\nthe object of one's investigation is to observe the interaction between atoms and surfaces structured at the \u03bcm scale, for example hemispherical mirrors of the type investigated in [6], the\nsignal from the atoms will almost certainly be lost due to unwanted scattering of light into the\noptical system. MOTs on the meso- and microscopic scale, in particular, have received some\nrecent interest [7], but the small atom numbers in such traps have so far hindered their imaging\nand characterisation [8]. In this article we propose a modified configuration that we call the\n'\u039bMOT' and implement an imaging system based on a two-stage excitation process [9], which\nhelp us overcome each of these limitations and aid our exploration of different atom\u2013surface\ninteractions.\nThis paper is structured as follows. The next section is devoted to the description and characterization of our trap geometry. We then discuss the mechanism behind our multilevel imaging\nsystem and show how it does indeed allow for practically background-free imaging of the atom\ntrap. The subsequent section discusses surface loading by magneto-optic launching, which allows us to load atoms onto a surface with a three-dimensional range of motion. Finally, we\nconclude and summarize the main features of our system.\n2.\n\nThe \u039bMOT\n\n2.1. Description\nA single beam of circularly polarized light of the right helicity is split using a non-polarizing\nbeamsplitter, to generate the two beams that produce the trap, and a half-wave plate is inserted\nin one of the two resulting beams to achieve the correct polarizations. Each of these beams,\ndenoted S, is then used to construct the geometry shown in Fig. 1. Mirror C is set up so as to\nretroreflect the beam. Mirrors B and C, together with the quarter-wave plate, allow us to change\nthe polarization in the retroreflected branch independently of the incoming polarization. In a\nnormal mirror MOT, the polarizations cannot be modified independently of each other and the\nquadrupole axis has to be at an oblique angle to the mirror. The four beams traveling towards\nO thus have the correct polarizations to produce the trapping and cooling forces necessary to\nform a MOT in this plane. Combined with the second set of beams, this means that the MOT\nis formed in the intersection region of four pairs of counterpropagating beams. We note that\nalignment of mirror B such that the beam is retroreflected perfectly will recover the traditional\nmirror MOT beam geometry, albeit with the incorrect polarizations for a MOT cloud to form.\n\n\fFig. 1. (Color online.) Schematic of one of the two beam paths involved in our MOT geometry. S is the incoming beam; A, B, and C are mirrors. The component marked '\u03bb /4'\nis a quarter-wave plate. The cold atom cloud forms in the intersection region, O. In this\ndiagram we do not show a second, identical, beam, which provides trapping and cooling\nforces in the plane normal to the paper. The area of mirror A immediately adjacent to the\ntrapped atoms is not illuminated, and can therefore be patterned or structured to explore\natom\u2013surface interactions. Inset: The lower surface of mirror A, showing the MOT beams\nand the sample area, which is not illuminated by any of the beams.\n\nFig. 2. Image of our MOT in operation, corresponding to Fig. 1; mirror A is indicated in\nthe picture.\n\nSeveral advantages are apparent in the use of this geometry. The trapping volume is the entire\noverlap of the trapping beams, unlike that in a mirror MOT where half the trapping volume is\nrendered inaccessible by the presence of the mirror. Optical access is also much improved,\nboth because the coils are oriented in such a way as to be less obstructive, and because we\nhave removed the necessity of having a beam traveling in a plane parallel to mirror A. This\nallows us to use as much of the 360\u00b0 viewing angle in that plane as is necessary for imaging\nor manipulation beams. If this is not a requirement, a simpler set-up can alternatively be used,\nwhere only one set of beams is used in the double-'\u039b' geometry, the trapping and cooling\nforces in the plane normal to the paper in Fig. 1 being produced by means of a separate pair of\ncounterpropagating beams.\nAn important advantage of this geometry is that the the double-'\u039b' shape of the MOT beams\naffords better imaging of the trap, allowing microscope objectives to be mounted very close to it.\nWith a custom-made objective, we can achieve high-NA imaging (NA > 0.5) and a diffraction-\n\n\fFig. 3. (Color online.) The four-level system in 85 Rb that we use to image our atoms. The\nMOT lasers (780 nm) and a laser at 776 nm are used to induce a ladder transition. The\npopulation decays back to the ground state, via an intermediate state, and emits a 420 nm\nphoton in the process. The hyperfine splitting of the excited states is not drawn for clarity.\n\nlimited resolution of < 2 \u03bcm. While a similar degree of optical access may be possible in the\ntraditional 6-beam configuration, we note that this latter configuration is unsuitable for atom\u2013\nsurface interaction studies. In contrast, mirror A in our geometry can be replaced by any other\nsuitable reflecting surface. One candidate for such a reflecting surface would be one of the\nsurfaces of a Dove prism, which could then be used to form a two-dimensional bichromatic\nevanescent-field trap [10] close to the mirror surface. This trap would be loaded from the MOT\ncloud using such techniques as magneto-optic launching, which is explained in Section 4.\nAside from this marked increase in optical access, our system is simple to set up and operate.\nIn particular, it requires fewer beam paths than a traditional MOT (two rather than three) and\nalignment of the beams is also easy: a CCD camera looking up at the mirror can be used to\nalign the beams coarsely; once this is done, optimization of the cold atom signal provides the\nfine-tuning of the alignment.\n2.2. Characterization\nA typical trap, as shown in Fig. 2, contains around 4 \u00d7 104 85 Rb atoms and has a 1/e diameter of\nthe order of 400 \u03bcm along the minor axes. Combined with a measured trap lifetime \u03c40 \u2248 6 s, this\nallows us to infer the trap loading rate, N0 /\u03c40 \u2248 6.7\u00d7103 s\u22121 . We measured a cloud temperature\nof 110 \u00b1 40 \u03bcK, the large uncertainty being due to the imprecision in measuring the cloud size.\nTypical parameters for the operation of our trap are: a detuning of \u221214.9 MHz, or \u22122.5 \u0393\n(\u0393 \u2248 6.1 MHz [11]), for the cooling laser and a power of 6 mW divided between the two trapping beams (beam diameter: 6 mm). The minimum power necessary to produce the MOT was\nfound to be \u2248 1.3 mW in each of the two beams. The trap was loaded from background gas\nof a natural isotopic mixture of rubidium at a pressure of 10\u22129 mbar. The cooling and repump\nlasers were locked using the DAVLL technique [12] for long-term stability and flexibility of\noperation.\n3.\n\nMultilevel imaging system\n\nThe most common method of imaging a cold atom cloud in a MOT is fluorescence imaging.\nWhen the cloud is close to a reflecting surface both the cloud and its reflections will be seen\nby the imaging system (see Ref. [13], for example). This situation is exacerbated by the presence of surfaces that reflect unwanted light into the imaging optics and thereby decreasing the\n\n\fFig. 4. 776 nm spectroscopy and locking system.

Fig. 2, shows an example of the mirror in our system scattering the MOT beams into the imaging system.\nThis problem may be overcome using two-stage excitation imaging. We make use of a fourlevel system in 85 Rb (see Fig. 3 for details), similarly to Refs. [14] and [15]; atoms in the 5S1/2\nground state are pumped to the 5D5/2 state via 780 nm and 776 nm radiation, the former being\nprovided by one of the MOT beams, and then decay back to the ground state via an intermediate\n6P3/2 state, emitting 420 nm radiation, which we detect. We note that a very similar system was\nrecently used to produce a multiphoton MOT [16]. In our system, this process gives a significantly smaller signal than can be obtained through 780 nm fluorescence imaging. However, it\nhas the benefit of being entirely background-free: in a well-shielded system, the entire 420 nm\nsignal reaching the detector has its origin in the cold atom cloud. Off-the-shelf filters can then\nbe used to remove the 780 nm radiation reaching the detector.\nGeneration of the 776 nm beam\nThe 776 nm beam is produced using a Sanyo DL7140-201S diode and the same external cavity\ndiode laser design used to produce the MOT cooling and trapping beams. Since 85 Rb has no\nspectral features in this wavelength range that are suitable for locking the laser frequency, a\nmultilevel locking system is used (see Fig. 4). 5 mW from each of the MOT cooling and repump beams (\u2248 780 nm) and 1.5 mW from the 776 nm beam, all rendered circularly polarized\nby the quarter-wave plates, enter the heated vapor cell (VC) from opposite ends. A large-area\nUV-enhanced filtered silicon photodiode (PD), operating in photovoltaic mode, picks up the\nresulting Doppler-free fluorescence and is amplified by means of a LMP7721 amplifier chip.\nMagnetic coils surrounding the heated vapor cell control the Zeeman shift of the magnetic sublevels of the atoms inside the cell, shifting this signal, and therefore the lock point, as required.\nAround 4 mW of the 776 nm beam is then mixed in with the MOT cooling and repump beams\nand sent through a fiber to the MOT.\nWe show a sample 420 nm signal, as detected at the photodiode, in Fig. 5, where the hyperfine\nsplitting of the 5D5/2 level in 85 Rb is evident in the shoulders on the right-hand side of the\npeak in the figure. The 776 nm laser diode is locked to the side of one the main peak, at the\npoint indicated by the dashed line in Fig. 6, using a conventional PID circuit. The lock point is\nfound by manually and slowly adjusting the frequency offset of the 776 nm laser to maximize\nthe fluorescence from the MOT cloud. Evident in this latter figure are two well-resolved peaks,\ncaused by the Autler\u2013Townes splitting [17]. Locking at a detuning of around 6.5 MHz from the\npeak of absorption in the vapor cell gives the strongest signal in the MOT cloud, as recorded by\nthe photomultiplier tube trace shown in the same figure.\n\n\fSignal (arb. units)\n\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n-30\n\n-20\n\n-10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\nFrequency detuning (MHz)\n\nFig. 5. 420 nm fluorescence from the vapor cell, observed on PD (see Fig. 4) as a function\nof the detuning of the 776 nm beam, with the cooling and repump beams locked and shifted\nby 80 MHz with respect to the frequencies required to make a MOT. The various peaks are\ndue the hyperfine structure in 85 Rb. To obtain these data, we removed the quarter-wave\nplates on either end of the vapor cell, thus having linearly polarized light entering the cell\nfrom both ends.\n\nFig. 6.

Several methods have\nbeen devised for moving cold atom clouds, including the use of push beams [18] and moving\nmagnetic coils [19]. Push beams are easy to set up, requiring either the addition of one extra\nbeam or the switching off of one of the counterpropagating beams, but cannot be used to push\natom clouds towards highly reflective surfaces. Using moving magnetic coils requires a rather\ninvolved mechanical setup.\nWe make use of a third method, which we call magneto-optic launching, for transport of the\n\n\fFig. 7. (Color online.) A sequence of four false color fluorescence images, taken at 8 ms\nintervals, of the cloud before and after it has been given a magnetic impulse.

The transfer efficiency after 24 ms is over\n40%.\n\natom cloud by rapidly moving the trap center and then releasing the cloud, thereby imparting\nmomentum to it. An auxiliary coil is added to the system in Fig. 1, above the upper MOT coil.\nAfter the MOT cloud forms, a long current pulse is applied to this auxiliary coil, which launches\nthe cloud upward with a speed determined by the size and duration of the current pulse, and\nthen the cloud is released from the trap by switching off the MOT beams after 20 ms. Fig. 7\nshows a series of photographs of the cloud after being launched by a magnetic pulse. It can\nbe seen that the pulse results in an approximately uniform vertical cloud speed of 0.063 m s\u22121 .\nThe physical orientation of our system, with the mirror and sample being above the trapping\nregion, allow us to launch the cloud upwards with a much greater degree of control than would\nbe possible if the cloud were merely dropped downwards.\nFinally, we note that the equilibrium distance of the MOT cloud from the mirror surface\ndepends on the beam diameter and the size of the 'sample area', i.e., the section of the mirror\nthat acts as a sample and is not usable as a plane mirror. With a sample area diameter of 2 mm\nand beam diameter of 4 mm, the cloud can be made to form less than 4 mm away from the\nsurface, allowing us to use the magneto-optic launching method to move the atoms closer to\nthe surface for interaction studies.\n5.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe have introduced and characterized a modified magneto-optical trap geometry that allows\nthe behavior of atoms close to surfaces to be explored with greater flexibility and better optical\naccess than the standard configurations. A multilevel imaging system, which proves to be important in eliminating background signals and unwanted scatter when atoms are close to highly\nreflecting templated surfaces, was also characterized and explored. The combined system is\ntherefore ideal for exploring the miniaturization of atom traps and is easily applied to a wide\nrange of experiments.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by the UK EPSRC grants EP/E039839/1 and EP/E058949/1 and by\nthe Cavity-Mediated Molecular Cooling collaboration within the the EuroQUAM programme\nof the ESF.\n\n\fStimulated Raman transitions via multiple atomic levels\nJames Bateman,\u2217 Andr\u00e9 Xuereb, and Tim Freegarde\nSchool of Physics and Astronomy, University of Southampton, Southampton, SO17 1BJ, United Kingdom\n(Dated: April 13, 2010)\n\narXiv:0908.2389v4 [quant-ph] 12 Apr 2010\n\nWe consider the stimulated Raman transition between two long-lived states via multiple intermediate states, such as between hyperfine ground states in the alkali-metal atoms.

This technique has been used to measure sublinewidth features [4, 5] and to construct atomic interferometers which, by exploiting photon recoil, create spatially separated atomic wave packets which are sensitive\nto gravity [6, 7] or fundamental constants [8, 9]. The\neffective two-level system, which emerges from the Raman problem, can exhibit behavior such as Rabi flopping [10, 11], can be used for experiments such as Ramsey interferometry [12, 13], and can provide the qubits\nfor quantum information processing [14\u201316]. Sequences\nof Raman pulses can be used to craft arbitrary superpositions in systems with numerous metastable states [17]\nand to prepare such systems in particular states prior to\ncoherent manipulation [18]. Raman processes have also\nbeen used to cool atomic samples to far below the photon\nrecoil limit [19\u201322].\nThroughout the literature, when the Raman transition\nis discussed, the level structure of the atom is often approximated to three levels-two metastable states and\none intermediate (radiative) state. The Raman problem\nis solved for this prototypical case and then extended,\nwithout proof, to include the multilevel structure of the\natom by summing over the various possible routes (see,\ne.g., Ref. [7, \u00a72.1]). Here, by including multiple routes\nfrom the outset, we confirm that this simple approach is\ncorrect, show how an expression for the lightshift emerges\nnaturally from this treatment, and show that the system\nbehaves as a two-level system with an effective coupling\nstrength and an effective detuning.\nThere is much existing work related to this problem.\nThe three-level (single intermediate state) off-resonant\ncase has been treated [23], there have been extensions to\nfour levels [24], and the general multilevel problem has\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: jbateman@soton.ac.uk\n\nbeen recast into \"serial\" and \"parallel\" cases [25]. It has\nnever been shown rigorously, however, that the threelevel case can be extended in the way so often assumed.\nIn the following, we use the semiclassical approach but\nalternatively one might consider the Jaynes\u2013Cummings\nmodel [26, 27].\nThis article is structured as follows. We first describe,\nin Sec. II, the Raman transition in a three-level system\nand we show how this can be generalized to include multiple intermediate states; details of the lengthly calculation\nare confined to the appendix. We then derive, in Sec. III,\nexpressions for the behavior of the quantum-mechanical\namplitudes in the general, off-resonance case. In Sec. IV\nwe show how these results can be applied to alkali-metal\natoms, and we conclude in Sec. V.\n\nII.\n\nTHREE-LEVEL SYSTEMS\n\nThe simplest system in which a Raman transition may\nbe driven is the three-level \"\u039b\" system, illustrated in\nFig. 1, in which two long-lived ground states are coupled\nvia a radiative upper state which, because the singlephoton detuning is sufficiently large, is never significantly\npopulated. We label the states of the system by |ni, with\nstates |0i and |2i coupled by the \"pump\" field of strength\n\u03a9P and frequency \u03c9P , and states |1i and |2i coupled by\nthe \"Stokes\" field of strength \u03a9S and frequency \u03c9S . Using\nthe usual correspondence between bra\u2013ket and column\nvector notation (see, e.g., Ref. [28, \u00a7II-C]), the Hamiltonian for this system may be represented by the following\nmatrix (see, e.g., Ref. [11, \u00a73.2]):\n\uf8f6\n\u03c90\n0\n\u03a9P cos \u03c9P t\n\uf8ed0\n\u03c91\n\u03a9S cos \u03c9S t \uf8f8 .\n\u03a9P cos \u03c9P t \u03a9S cos \u03c9S t \u03c92\n\uf8eb\n\n(1)\n\nHere, as in standard treatments, we assume there is no\ncoupling between states |0i and |2i by the Stokes field,\nor between states |1i and |2i by the pump field.\nThis Hamiltonian can be simplified by making the rotating wave approximation and transforming to the inter-\n\n\f2\ntion with this Hamiltonian by using unitary transformations to find a basis where the time evolution of the states\nis simple and the transformed Hamiltonian is diagonal.\nWhen one makes such a conversion between bases, is it\npossible to find an equivalent Schr\u00f6dinger equation with a\ntransformed Hamiltonian [11]: if |\u03c8B i = \u00d4BA |\u03c8A i, then\ni(\u2202/\u2202t) |\u03c8B i = \u0124B |\u03c8B i where\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202 \u22121\n\u22121\n.\n(4)\n\u2212 i \u00d4BA\n\u0124B = \u00d4BA \u0124A \u00d4BA\n\u2202t\n\nFIG. 1: A simple three-level \"\u039b\" system, in which a Raman\ntransition between states |0i and |1i is driven by \"pump\" and\n\"Stokes\" fields via intermediate state |2i. For each field, the\ncoupling strength and frequency are shown in parentheses,\nand frequencies are chosen to be near two-photon resonance:\n\u03c9P = (\u03c92 \u2212 \u03c90 ) + \u2206; \u03c9S = (\u03c91 \u2212 \u03c90 ) + (\u2206 + \u03b4). The singlephoton detuning \u2206 is large compared with the couplings,\n|\u2206| \u226b \u03a9P,S , and, in this illustration, is negative: \u2206 < 0.\nThe two-photon detuning \u03b4 is small compared with the separation between the ground states and, in this illustration, is\nalso negative.\n\naction picture. This yields a slowly varying Hamiltonian,\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n1\n0\n0\n2 \u03a9P\n1\n+i\u03b4t \uf8f8\n\u0124 = \uf8ed 0\n,\n(2)\n0\n2 \u03a9S e\n1\n1\n\u2212i\u03b4t\n\u03a9\n\u03a9\ne\n\u2212\u2206\n2 P 2 S\n\nwhere the pump frequency \u03c9P = (\u03c92 \u2212\u03c90 )+\u2206 is detuned\nfrom single-photon resonance by \u2206, and the difference\nbetween the pump frequency and the Stokes frequency\n\u03c9S = (\u03c91 \u2212 \u03c90 ) + (\u2206 + \u03b4) is offset by \u03b4 from the twophoton resonance (\u03c91 \u2212 \u03c90 ). We now extend this interaction picture to include multiple levels and define the\nHamiltonian \u0124A to be\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n1\n1\n0\n0\n...\n2 \u03a9P;2\n2 \u03a9P;3\n1\n+i\u03b4t 1\n+i\u03b4t\n\uf8ec 0\n... \uf8f7\n0\n2 \u03a9S;2 e\n2 \u03a9S;3 e\n\uf8ec 1 \u2217\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec 2 \u03a9P;2 12 \u03a9\u2217S;2 e\u2212i\u03b4t\n\u2212\u2206\n0\n... \uf8f7\n2\n\uf8ec 1 \u2217\n\uf8f7.\n\uf8ec \u03a9P;3 1 \u03a9\u2217S;3 e\u2212i\u03b4t\n0\n\u2212\u22063\n... \uf8f7\n2\n\uf8ed 2\n\uf8f8\n..\n..\n..\n..\n..\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n(3)\nThe second part of the subscript, 2, 3, . . . , N , denotes the\nlevel to which the pump or Stokes field couples. Note that\nthe oscillation frequency is the same for each Stokes term\nbecause this depends on the difference in the frequency of\nthe fields and not on the Bohr energy of the intermediate\nlevel. However, the single-photon detunings do depend\non the intermediate level Bohr frequencies, but we now\nmake the approximation that the detuning is large compared with the separation of these intermediate levels,\nand hence \u2206 := \u22062 \u2248 \u22063 \u2248 . . . \u2248 \u2206N .\nIn this limit, the above Hamiltonian describes a Raman\nsystem and we expect to see oscillations of population between the ground states. We solve the Schr\u00f6dinger equa-\n\nFor the multistate Hamiltonian \u0124A in Eq. (3), we\nchoose the operator \u00d4BA to be the matrix of eigenvectors; the first term \u00d4\u0124 \u00d4\u22121 is thus the diagonal matrix\nof the eigenvalues. In the appendix, we detail a procedure to find the eigensystem of this Hamiltonian; we\nfind two eigenvectors which are superpositions of these\nground states, and N \u2212 2 more which are superpositions\nof the remaining intermediate levels. These N \u2212 2 upper\nstates are decoupled from the ground states and so we\nignore them in the following treatment.\nThe difference between the eigenvalues for the two\nground state eigenvectors is\nr\n1\neB = 1\n|\u03a9P * \u03a9\u2217S |2 + (k\u03a9S k2 \u2212 k\u03a9P k2 )2 , (5)\n\u03a9\n2\u2206\n4\nwhere, for conciseness, we have represented the couplings as vectors \u03a9P and \u03a9S with components \u03a9P;i and\n\u03a9S;i respectively, and have used vector notation for dot\nproducts and norms. This oscillation frequency is composed p\nof a coupling strength \u03a9B and a detuning \u2206B , via\ne B = \u03a92 + \u22062 , analogously to a two-level system:\n\u03a9\nB\nB\n|\u03a9P * \u03a9\u2217S |\n,\n2\u2206\n2\nk\u03a9S k \u2212 k\u03a9P k2\n.\n=\n4\u2206\n\n\u03a9B =\n\n(6)\n\n\u2206B\n\n(7)\n\nThe detuning \u2206B is readily identified as the lightshift\nand we justify this in the next section.\nThe operator which describes the transformation from\nthe bare ground states to these dressed ground states can,\nbecause of normalization, be written as a rotation:\n\u0012\n\u0013\ncos \u03b8 e+i\u03b4t sin \u03b8\n\u00d4BA =\n,\n(8)\n\u2212e\u2212i\u03b4t sin \u03b8\ncos \u03b8\n\u0010\n\u0011\ne B /\u03a9B .\nand the angle \u03b8 is defined by tan \u03b8 = \u2206B \u2212 \u03a9\nThis treatment is sufficient for the on two-photon resonance case, where \u03b4 = 0, but in general the effective\nHamiltonian \u0124B also contains a time-derivative second\nterm, originating from the time-dependence of the operator \u00d4BA . Away from the two-photon resonance, where\n\u03b4 6= 0, we find the following slowly varying, but nevertheless time-dependent, effective Hamiltonian:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2212\u03b4 sin2 \u03b8\n\u2212\u03b4e+i\u03b4t cos \u03b8 sin \u03b8\n\u0124B =\n.

(9) has the same form as\nthat for the simple two-level problem in the interaction\npicture and with the rotating-wave approximation. We\ncan, therefore, use familiar tools to solve this problem.\nFirst, we transform to find a time-independent Hamiltonian using the operator \u00d4CB in Eq. (4):\n\u0012\n\n1 0\n0 ei\u03b4t\n\u0012\n=\u21d2 \u0124C =\n\n\u00d4CB =\n\n\u0013\n\n\u2212\u03b4 sin2 \u03b8\n\u2212\u03b4 cos \u03b8 sin \u03b8\neB\n\u2212\u03b4 cos \u03b8 sin \u03b8 \u03b4 cos2 \u03b8 + \u03a9\n\n\u0013\n\n. (10)\n\nNext, analogously to the dressed-states approach, we rotate by an angle \u03b82 (thus defining \u00d4DC ) where\ntan(2\u03b82 ) =\n\n\u03b4 sin(2\u03b8)\n,\ne\n\u03a9B \u2212 \u03b4 cos(2\u03b8)\n\n(11)\n\nto find a diagonal Hamiltonian \u0124D . The difference between the diagonal elements of \u0124D corresponds to the\ne D of the states in this baphase evolution frequency \u03a9\nsis. As in the previous section, we see that this oscillation frequency is composed of a coupling strength\n\u03a9B\np\ne D = \u03a92 + \u22062 ,\nand a modified effective detuning \u2206D : \u03a9\nB\nD\nwhere \u2206D = \u2206B \u2212\u03b4 is the detuning relative to \u2206B , which\nwas previously identified as the lightshift.\nWe now relate the pure phase evolution in this doubly\ndressed basis to the evolution of the bare states by concatenating the transformations that led us to this final\nHamiltonian:\n\u00d4DA = \u00d4DC * \u00d4CB * \u00d4BA\n\n(12)\n\nand |\u03c8D i = \u00d4DA |\u03c8A i, or\n\u0012\n\nD0\nD1\n\n\u0013\n\n=\n\n\u0012\n\ncos(\u03b8 + \u03b82 ) ei\u03b4t sin(\u03b8 + \u03b82 )\n\u2212 sin(\u03b8 + \u03b82 ) ei\u03b4t cos(\u03b8 + \u03b82 )\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\nA0\nA1\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(13)\nwhere D0,1 and A0,1 are the ground- and excited-state\ncomponents of the doubly dressed wave function |\u03c8D i\nand the bare (interaction picture) wave function |\u03c8A i,\nrespectively. Finally, the time evolution of the doubly\ndressed states is simply\n\u0012\n\nD0 (t)\nD1 (t)\n\n\u0013\n\n=\n\n\u0012\n\nD0 (t = 0)\ne\nD1 (t = 0)ei\u03a9D t\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\nExplicit forms of the amplitudes\n\nThe time dependence of the bare state coefficients\nA0,1 (t) is readily calculable from the procedure described\nabove and is stated here for completeness:\n\u0014\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0011\u0015\ne D t \u2212 i \u2206D sin 1 \u03a9\ne Dt\nA0 (t) = A0 (0) cos 12 \u03a9\n2\neD\n\u03a9\n!\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u03a9D\n1e\n;\n(15a)\nsin 2 \u03a9D t\n+ A1 (0) i\neD\n\u03a9\n\u0014\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0011\u0015\n\u0010\ne D t + i \u2206D sin 1 \u03a9\ne Dt\nA1 (t) = A1 (0) cos 12 \u03a9\n2\neD\n\u03a9\n!\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u03a9D\ne D t e\u2212i\u03b4t .\nsin 21 \u03a9\n+ A0 (0) i\n(15b)\neD\n\u03a9\n\nHence the system behaves as a two-level system with the\ncoupling strength \u03a9D = \u03a9B and detuning \u2206D = \u2206B \u2212 \u03b4,\nrelative to the effective detuning \u2206B . This justifies our\nprevious identification of \u2206B with the lightshift.\nB.\n\nOscillation amplitude\n\nThe complete, but cumbersome, formulas in Eq. (15)\ndescribe the behavior of the bare-state amplitudes in\nterms of the bare state initial conditions. If, instead,\nwe express this evolution in terms of the initial values\nin the doubly dressed basis, we see clearly that the evolution is composed of a time-independent offset and an\noscillation:\ne\n\nA0 (t) = cos(\u03b8 + \u03b82 )D0 (0) \u2212 sin(\u03b8 + \u03b82 )D1 (0)ei\u03a9D t . (16)\n2\n\nThe population p0 (t) = |A0 (t)| in state |0i therefore\noscillates with peak-to-peak amplitude no greater than\nm = sin [2(\u03b8 + \u03b82 )] which, expressed in terms of the effective coupling strength and detuning, is\n\u03a9B\nm= p 2\n.\n\u03a9B + \u22062D\n\n(17)\n\nThis envelope function describes a power-broadened\nLorentzian, centered on the light shifted frequency difference between the ground states. This expression represents the maximum possible population transfer, and\nany oscillation will be contained within this envelope.\n\n(14)\n\nUsing Eq. (13) we can find the dressed state initial\nconditions D0,1 (t = 0) in terms of the bare state initial\nconditions A0,1 (t = 0). Using these values, we can then\nuse Eq. (14) to find the dressed state coefficients at some\nlater time. Finally, we can invert the transformation in\nEq. (13) to find the time evolution of the bare state amplitudes.\n\nC.\n\nComments\n\nA few specific cases are provided here for illustration.\nFirst, for \u03a9P = (0, 0, \u03a9P ) and \u03a9S = (0, 0, \u03a9S ) we recover\nthe well-known results for the three level problem. Next\nwe note two interesting cases: for k\u03a9P k = k\u03a9S k, the\nlightshift \u2206B is zero. On the other hand, for |\u03a9P * \u03a9\u2217S | =\n0, the Rabi frequency \u03a9B is zero.\n\n\f4\nIf, as in this last case, the coupling vectors \u03a9P and \u03a9\u2217S\nare orthogonal, then the transition is not driven. Examples include the trivial case where there is no intermediate state to which both ground states are coupled and\nthe case where there are states to which both are coupled, but where these individual coupling strengths sum\nto zero. However, unless the vectors are orthogonal, it\nis possible to adjust the pump and Stokes field strengths\nto ensure the norms of the vectors are equal, and hence\nthat the lightshift is zero.\nOur approach relies on the slow time-dependence of the\ninteraction-picture Hamiltonian: we require that the system is near two-photon resonance, as previously stated,\nand that there is no coupling of state |0i by the Stokes\nfield or of state |1i by the pump field. If present, these\ncross-coupling terms would cause the off-diagonal terms\nin \u0124A to oscillate in amplitude as well as phase, and the\ntreatment in the appendix would no longer be valid.\nFor our treatment to be valid, it must therefore be possible to identify clearly which field is resonant with which\ntransition (see Refs [1, \u00a713.1] and [11, \u00a73.9] for further discussion). First, the detuning must be such that no field\nis close to a single-photon resonance: |\u2206| \u226b k\u03a9P,S k and\n|\u2206 \u00b1 \u03c910 | \u226b k\u03a9P,Sk. Additionally, the coupling strength\nmust be sufficiently small that each ground state can be\nresolved: \u03c910 \u226b k\u03a9P,Sk. If this last condition is violated,\nthe system may still appear Ramanlike and exhibit coherent behavior, but it is not described adequately by\nthe treatment in this article.\n\nlinear and left and right circular polarizations, respectively; mF labels the Zeeman sublevel, corresponding to\nthe projection of the total angular momentum F along\nthe quantization axis provided by an external magnetic\nfield [30]. Linear polarization, in this context, refers\nspecifically to the case of the light electric field parallel to the quantization axis; if these axes are orthogonal,\nthe light field interacts with the atom as though it were\na superposition of left and right circular polarizations.\nThe coupling strengths \u03a9P,S depend not only on the\nlight intensities but also on the dipole matrix element for\nthe transition. Using the Wigner-Eckart theorem [30\u201332]\nwe can split the overlap integral needed to find this dipole\nmatrix element and extract from it a purely geometrical\nterm G, leaving a term which embodies the other physical\ndetails of the transition:\n62 P3/2 , F \u2032 , m\u2032F \u03bc\u0302 62 S1/2 , F, mF\n\u2032\n\n= hJk\u03bc\u0302kJ \u2032 i\n\n\u00d7 G (I, J, F, mF , J , F \u2032 , m\u2032F , q) .\n\n(19)\n\nThe \"reduced\" matrix element, denoted by double bars k,\ndepends on many details of the atom, including nuclear\nmass, and is not easily calculated; it can, however, be\nfound experimentally from measurements of the upperstate lifetime, as described by Loudon [33, Eq. (2.57)]\nand Demtr\u00f6der [34]:\n\u0393=\n\n16\u03c0 3 2J + 1\n2\n|hJk\u03bc\u0302kJ \u2032 i| .\n3\u01eb0 h\u03bb3 2J \u2032 + 1\n\n(20)\n\nThe second part is the product of geometrical terms:\nIV.\n\nALKALI-METAL ATOMS\n\nG = (\u22121)2F\nWe are able to calculate the Rabi frequency and lightshift for two states |0i and |1i coupled via a number of\nupper states. A common embodiment of this situation is\nthe coupling of two ground hyperfine states via a manifold of upper hyperfine states in an alkali-metal atom.\nIndeed, there typically exists many such pairs of states,\nbut, as ensured by conservation of angular momentum,\none state is Raman coupled to at most one other state;\nhence, the total system may be treated as a collection of\nindependent pairwise couplings.\nAs a typical example, consider the Raman transition\nbetween the ground hyperfine states, via the radiative upper states, in atomic cesium. The pump and Stokes fields,\nboth tuned near to the D2 transition at 852 nm, couple\nstates 62 S1/2 , F = 3 and 62 S1/2 , F = 4 , respectively,\nto the 62 P3/2 manifold, and have a frequency difference\nnear to the hyperfine splitting of 9.2 GHz [29]. The two\nground states and the intermediate states are\n|0i = 62 S1/2 ; F = 3; mF ,\n|1i = 62 S1/2 ; F = 4; mF + qP \u2212 qS , and\n|ni = 62 P3/2 ; F = 2, 3, 4, 5; mF + qP ,\n\n(18)\n\nwhere qP,S = 0, \u22121, +1 are the polarizations of the copropagating pump and Stokes fields and correspond to\n\n\u2032\n\np\n(2F \u2032 + 1) (2F + 1) (2J + 1)\n\u001b\n\u0012 \u2032\n\u0013\u001a\nF 1 F\nJ J\u2032 1\n(21)\n\u00d7\n\u2032\n\u2032\nmF q \u2212mF\nF F I\n\n+J+I+mF\n\nwhere the arraylike symbol in parentheses (. . .) is the\nWigner 3-j symbol and the similar term in braces {. . .}\nis the Wigner 6-j symbol [35, \u00a73.3]; both are closely related to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. This relation\nis described in detail by Edmonds [36]. The two states\ncoupled by the Raman interaction are both in 62 S1/2 so,\nin the calculations that follow, it is only this geometrical\nterm which is relevant.\nWe imagine the atom in a region of uniform magnetic\nfield and consider an experiment where it is possible to\nadjust the frequency difference in order to sweep across\ntransitions between various Zeeman sublevels. The properties which affect the dipole moment are the various\nquantum numbers: the nuclear spin I = 7/2; the electron angular momentum J = 1/2 or J \u2032 = 3/2; the total\nangular momentum F = 3 to F = 4 via F \u2032 = 2, 3, 4, 5;\nand the aforementioned projection mF of F along the\nquantization axis.\nThe coupling strength for a dipole transition between\nstates |ni and |mi is proportional to the electric field [1]:\n\u03a9P,S = EP,S hn| \u03bc\u0302 |mi /~\n\n(22)\n\n\f5\nwhere \u03bc\u0302 is the dipole operator. As above, we can extract\na geometrical term and, using the vector notation,\n\n1.2\n\n1\n\n(23)\n0.8\n\nHence, the relative properties of each of the Zeeman sublevels are determined by the geometrical terms GP,S.\nIf we revisit the equations for the coupling strength\n(Eq. (6)) and the lightshift (Eq. (7)), we see that these\nterms appear as |GP * GS | and kGP,Sk2 , respectively.\nThus:\nhJk\u03bc\u0302kJ \u2032 i2\n|EP ES\u2217 | |GP * GS | and\n(24)\n2\u2206 ~2\n\u0011\n\u2032 2\u0010\nhJk\u03bc\u0302kJ i\n|ES |2 kGS k2 \u2212 |EP |2 kGP k2 . (25)\n\u2206B =\n4\u2206 ~2\n\u03a9B =\n\nIt is simple to calculate these factors for a given\ninitial state and pair of polarizations to examine how\nthe lightshift and the coupling strength depend on\nthe strength of the applied fields.\nWe find that\nkGk2 , for transitions from |J = 1/2, F = I \u00b1 1/2, mF i to\n|J \u2032 , F \u2032 , mF + qi, driven by light with polarization q, are,\nfor an alkali-metal atom with nuclear spin I, given by\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n2\n\u2032 q mF\nkGk =\n1 \u00b1 A(J )\n(26)\n3\n2I + 1\n\nwhere A(1/2) = \u22122 for the D1 transition and A(3/2) = 1\nfor the D2 transition. The pump vector GP couples from\nthe lower hyperfine state and corresponds to the negative branch (F = I \u2212 1/2); the stokes vector GS couples\nfrom the upper hyperfine state and corresponds to the\npositive branch (F = I + 1/2). Using these expressions\nand Eq. (25), one may easily calculate the lightshift for\na given Raman transition in any alkali-metal atom.\nWe now turn to the coupling strength \u03a9B which, for\nequal polarizations (qP , qS ) = (1, 1), is symmetrical about\nmF = 0. We find\nq\n|A(J \u2032 )|\n(I + 1/2)2 \u2212 m2F ,\n(27)\n|GP * GS | =\n3(2I + 1)\nfor the D1 and D2 transitions, where A is given above.\nIf we now break this symmetry by choosing, for example,\n(qP , qS ) = (0, 1), we find\n|GP * GS | =\n\n|A(J \u2032 )| p\nT (I + 1/2 \u2212 mF ) ,\n3(2I + 1)\n\n(28)\n\nwhere T (n) is the nth triangular number (1, 3, 6, 10 . . .).\nThe dependence of coupling strength on mF level is illustrated in Fig. 2.\nThe values for a common arrangement are shown in\nTable I. While of course linear in any overall scaling of\nthe intensity, the lightshift has a different dependence\non the individual field strengths for each of the Zeeman\nsublevels. It is offset from zero (for unequal intensities)\nand is linear in mF ; the lightshift between the hyperfine\nground states hence has the same dependence on mF as\n\n|GP * GS |\n\n\u03a9P,S = EP,S hJk\u03bc\u0302kJ \u2032 iGP,S /~ .\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nmF\n\nFIG. 2: Illustration of the dependence of coupling strength\ndescribed by Eqs (27) (solid) and (28) (dashed).

[37], is sufficient to\naccount for the majority of the observed spacing between\nthe spectral peaks.\nThe coupling strengths are not necessarily symmetrical\nabout mF = 0 and, for an experiment in which damping\nis important, this may be manifest as a change in the amplitude of the peaks. However, the common arrangement\nof equal polarizations does not show this asymmetry, and,\nas noted in Ref. [37], asymmetry in the preparation of the\ninitial states is also important.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have described the stimulated Raman transition\nand, by including multiple intermediate states from\nthe outset, have obtained results which give the coupling strength for the multistate system and from which\nthe lightshift naturally emerges. We have applied this\n\n\f6\nmethod to the cesium atom, given more general expressions for the alkali-metal atoms, and noted how the linear dependence of the lightshift on the mF level mimics a\nZeeman shift. We comment on the possibility of the dependence of the coupling strength on mF level manifesting as a variation in peak height in experimental spectra.\nOur results were derived in the limit of far detuning\nand our calculations were simplified greatly by this enforced absence of decoherence. However, for specific coupling strengths and detunings, the problem of finding\neigenvalues and vectors can be treated numerically, and\nmany efficient algorithms exist for this task. Hence, a\nsimilar approach might be used for situations including\ncoherent population trapping [38, 39] and electromagnetically induced transparency [40, 41].\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank Steven Barnett and Dieter Meschede and\nhis group for helpful discussions.

Box 49, Hungary\n(Dated: July 2, 2010)\n\narXiv:1002.0463v3 [physics.optics] 1 Jul 2010\n\n2\n\nThe fields in multiple-pass interferometers, such as the Fabry\u2013P\u00e9rot cavity, exhibit great sensitivity not only to the presence but also to the motion of any scattering object within the optical path.\nWe consider the general case of an interferometer comprising an arbitrary configuration of generic\n'beam splitters' and calculate the velocity-dependent radiation field and the light force exerted on\na moving scatterer. We find that a simple configuration, in which the scatterer interacts with an\noptical resonator from which it is spatially separated, can enhance the optomechanical friction by\nseveral orders of magnitude.\nPACS numbers: 42.50.Wk, 42.79.Gn, 07.10.Cm, 07.60.Ly\n\nOptomechanics [1] is a rapidly growing field addressing the manipulation of macroscopic scatterers by making\nuse of the mechanical effects of light. The ponderomotive force exhibits a velocity-dependent character which\nstems from any retardation of the electromagnetic field\npresent in such systems. With an appropriate choice of\nparameters, velocity-dependent terms in the force may\nlead to viscous damping of motion [2].\nPure Doppler frequency shifting results in a velocity\ndependent force with a relative magnitude of order v/c,\nwhich is generally small at room temperature or below.\nThe laser cooling of atoms, for example, produces a significant cooling effect because it is resonantly enhanced\nby the atom with the Q-factor \u03c9/\u03b3 characteristic of an\natomic transition (\u03c9 is the frequency of the radiation, \u03b3\nis the linewidth of the transition). This situation can be\nmimicked in the case of a moving micro-mirror, as was\nproposed in Ref. [3], whereby a photonic crystal having a steep frequency-dependent reflection coefficient is\nmounted upon it. In the more general case of a nonresonant scatterer, the sensitivity of the radiation force\nto the velocity can be enhanced by coupling the moving object to a resonant optical element. This is the\ncase, for example, in several recent optomechanical cooling experiments [4\u20137]: the thermal vibration of one of the\nmicro-mirrors making up a Fabry\u2013P\u00e9rot-type resonator\ncan be quenched through the radiation pressure of the\nlight field enclosed in the resonator. Several factors limit\nthe efficiency of this mechanism in practice, including\nthe quality of the micromirrors that can be fabricated\nand the precision with which the cavities can be aligned.\nIn this Letter we generalize the conventional optomechanical cooling scheme [4\u20137] and calculate the linear response of the electromagnetic field to the motion of an arbitrary scatterer within a general 1D configuration of immobile optical elements on either side of it (see Fig. 1(a)).\nWe find that the field interference can be significantly\nsensitive to motion even if the scatterer lacks a specific\nfrequency-dependent reflectivity.\n\n\u0001\n\nFIG. 1: (a) The general system consisting of a mobile scatterer, S, between two sets of generic immobile optical elements\n(we show a Bragg reflector, on the left, and a Fabry\u2013P\u00e9rottype cavity, on the right, as an example). The mobile scatterer\ncan, a priori, represent anything, e.g., an atom or a mirror.\nWe discuss two specific configurations in this Letter: an atom\nin front of (b) a two-mirror cavity, and (c) a plane mirror [8].\n\nIn the second part of this Letter, the role of interference in enhancing the viscous cooling force is analyzed\nfor a simple geometry, in which the scatterer lies in front\nof, but not within, a standard two-mirror resonator, as\nin Fig. 1(b). With this scheme, which we label 'external\ncavity cooling', one can benefit from the high finesse of\nthe cavity even if the moving object has a low reflectivity.\nWe thus propose a very general, efficient optomechanical\ncooling mechanism applicable to a wide class of microor mesoscopic objects.\nWe begin by presenting the formal solution of the scattering model which we constructed in a recent paper for\ndealing with a general configuration of one-dimensional\noptomechanical systems [9]. Each element of the system\nis described by a transfer matrix which relates linearly\nthe field amplitudes on its left-hand side to those on the\nright-hand side. Transfer matrices for moving scatterers\nup to linear order in v/c have been constructed. The\ntransfer matrix of an arbitrary configuration of optical\nelements is then obtained by matrix multiplication. A\ndifficulty in analyzing complex networks originates from\nthe Doppler shift operator P\u0302v [9], which appears in the\ntransfer matrix of the moving scatterer and acts in the\nspace of the wave vectors rather than in the space of amplitudes: P\u0302v f (k) = f (k + k0 v/c), for any function f of\n\n\f2\nthe wavenumber k, where k0 is the carrier wavenumber\nin the system. For the mathematical description of the\nproblem, we start with the transfer matrices M\u0302S (k) and\nM1,2 (k) for the scatterer and for the general optical systems preceding and following the scatterer, respectively.\nExplicit forms for such matrices are given in Ref. [9]. We\nthen calculate the transfer matrix M\u0302 (k) of the entire system given by the product M\u0302 (k) = M1 (k) M\u0302S (k) M2 (k),\nand the matrix inverse M1\u22121 (k), such that\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\nAl\nA\nCr\nAl\n,\nand\n= M1\u22121\n= M\u0302\nBl\nB\nDr\nBl\nwhere we have omitted the k-dependence. We use the\nhat to indicate that the corresponding matrix contains\nthe Doppler shift operator P\u0302v . The elements of these\nmatrices, which we denote, for convenience, by\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0002 \u0003\n\u03b3\u0302 \u03b1\u0302\n,\n(1)\nM1\u22121 \u2261 \u03b8ij , and M\u0302 \u2261\n\u03b4\u0302 \u03b2\u0302\n\ncan all be obtained in a straightforward manner using\nonly 2-by-2 matrix multiplication for an arbitrary number of scatterers, and hence can in principle be calculated\nanalytically, or can be derived by using formal computer\nlanguages.\nIn order to make the mathematics more concise, we explicitly consider the case where we pump the system from\nonly one direction. Setting Cr (k) = 0 in Eq. (1), we obtain Al (k) = \u03b1\u0302\u03b2\u0302 \u22121 Bl (k). Because of the presence of \u03b2\u0302 \u22121 ,\nthis relation between the back-reflected and the incoming\nfields contains the powers of the shift operator P\u0302v to all\norders. In the simple example of one mirror moving in\nfront of a fixed one, the corresponding summation could\nbe carried out analytically [9]. However, this is not the\ncase generally. The crucial step to overcome this problem is to express the Doppler shift operator in the transfer\n\u2202\nmatrix M\u0302S to first order in v/c: P\u0302v = 1+ vc k0 \u2202k\n. Here we\nhave assumed that we pump at a single wavenumber; i.e.,\nwe take Bl (k) = B0 \u03b4(k \u2212 k0 ), with \u03b4(k) being the Dirac\n\u03b4 function and k0 being the wavenumber corresponding\nto the central pumping frequency. We can thus expand\nboth \u03b1\u0302 and \u03b2\u0302 in v/c and conveniently denote them by\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n(1) \u2202\n(1) \u2202\n(0)\n(0)\nand \u03b2\u0302 = \u03b20 + vc \u03b21 +\u03b21 \u2202k\n.\n\u03b1\u0302 = \u03b10 + vc \u03b11 +\u03b11 \u2202k\n(0)\n\nThe auxiliary functions \u03b10 , \u03b11 , . . . , are simply related to\nthe matrix elements defined in Eq. (1) and to the scattering strength parameter [9], or 'polarizability', \u03b6. We\nrecall that the amplitude reflectivity and transmissivity\nof the scatterer are related to \u03b6 by r = i\u03b6/(1 \u2212 i\u03b6) and\nt = 1 + r, respectively; the reflectivity and transmissivity of a mirror or scatterer are, in general, complex and\naccount automatically for phase shifts in the reflected\nand transmitted fields [10]. Thus \u03b2\u0302 can be inverted in\nclosed form up to linear order in v/c to yield the amplitude A(k). We then calculate the total field amplitudes\n\nR\nA(k) dk and B = B(k) dk and obtain\n\"\u0012\n\u0013\n(0)\n(0)\n\u03b10\nv\n\u03b1 \u03b20 \u2212 \u03b10 \u03b21\nA=\n\u03b811\n\u03b811 1\n+ \u03b812 +\n2\n\u03b20\nc\n\u03b20\n!#\n(1)\n(1)\n\u03b1 \u03b20 \u2212 \u03b10 \u03b21\n1 \u2202\nB0 = A0 + vc A1 ,\n\u03b811 1\n\u2212\n\u03b20 \u2202k\n\u03b20\n\nA=\n\nR\n\n(2)\nand similarly for B. This general solution for the field\namplitudes at the scatterer is one of the main results of\nthis Letter, and can be evaluated for an arbitrary system.\nThe amplitudes on the right side of the moving scatterer\ncan be expressed, using the elements of M\u0302S , as\n\u0001\nC = (1 \u2212 i\u03b6)A \u2212 i\u03b6 1 \u2212 2 vc B and\n\u0001\n(3)\nD = i\u03b6 1 + 2 vc A + (1 + i\u03b6)B ,\n\nwhere we have used the\nR explicit form of M\u0302\nR S , and where\nwe have defined C = C(k) dk and D = D(k) dk. In\nEqs. (3) we have also assumed that \u03b6 is independent of\nk. Upon using these relations, we obtain an expression\nfor the force acting on the scatterer, from which we can\nextract the friction force (see Ref. [9] for the details of\nthis derivation):\n\u0001\nvh 2\n|\u03b6| |A0 |2 \u2212 |B0 |2\nc\n\u0001\n+ |\u03b6|2 + Im{\u03b6} Re{A0 A\u22c61 } \u2212 2 Im{\u03b6} Re{A0 B0\u22c6 }\n\u0001\n+ |\u03b6|2 \u2212 Im{\u03b6} Re{B0 B1\u22c6 } + Im{\u03b6} Re{A0 B1\u22c6 }\noi\nn\u0010\n\u0011\n+ Re |\u03b6|2 + i Re{\u03b6} A1 B0\u22c6 . (4)\n\nF = \u22124h\u0304k0\n\nAll our assumptions-i.e., pumping at a single wavenumber, frequency independent polarizability (\u2202\u03b6/\u2202k = 0),\nand Cr (k) = 0-are simplifying assumptions and can\nbe relaxed. However, this would result in forms for\nthe friction force that are less transparent and amenable\nto analysis. We now apply this to the 'external cavity\ncooling' configuration, Fig. 1(b). As a reference system\nfor the analysis of the cooling force in this setup, we\nalso consider the 'mirror mediated cooling' configuration\n(see Fig. 1(c)), which has been previously discussed [8, 9],\nand which is the optomechanical cooling scheme used in\nmany experiments [4\u20137]. Note that in the 'external cavity cooling' scheme with a near mirror of complex transmissivity t, the limits of small and large |t| render the\nsituation where the cavity is replaced respectively by the\nnear mirror only or the far mirror only. For intermediate\nt compared with the transmissivity of the far mirror, T ,\nthe moving scatterer interacts with a field reflected back\nfrom the cavity and is subject to the interference created\nby the multiple reflections between the two mirrors. In\nthis text, we consider in particular an object having low\nreflectivity, around 50%, which corresponds to a polarizability \u03b6 = 1 and is representative of typical experimental\n\n\f109\n\n108\n\n107\n\n106\n\n5\n\n10\n-0.010\n\n10\n\n11\n\n10\n\n10\n\nFriction amplitude (units of ~k0 vc |Bl |2 )\n\nFriction amplitude (units of ~k0 vc |Bl |2 )\n\n1010\n\n0.000\n\n0.010\n\n0.020\n\n0.030\n\n0.040\n\nCavity detuning, \u03bb \u2212 2000\u03bb (units of \u03bb)\n\nFIG. 2: The amplitude of the friction force acting on the\nscatterer, for various near-mirror transmissivities, is shown as\na function of the mirror separation in the cavity.

This ensures that a high-finesse resonator\ncannot be formed between the object and the near mirror,\nthereby guaranteeing a parameter range where the cavity\nformed between the immobile mirrors dominates the interaction. For the sake of simplicity, we restrict ourselves\nto the special case of scatterers that can be characterized\nby a real polarizability; this is equivalent to assuming\nthat no absorption takes place in the scatterer. Similar\nresults hold when \u03b6 is not real.\nA numerical fit to Eq. (4) for |t| \u223c |T | and \u03b6 \u226a 1\nrenders a friction force of the approximate form\nF \u2248 \u22128h\u0304k02 \u03b6 2 vc (2x + 0.17F L) sin(4k0 x + \u03c6)|B0 |2 , (5)\nwhere F is the cavity finesse, L the cavity length (optimized as discussed below), x the separation between\nthe scatterer and the near mirror, and \u03c6 a phase factor.\nThe gross spatial variation of the friction force is linear in\nboth L and x; this is simply because of the linear increase\nof the retardation time of the reflected field with the distance between the scatterer and the mirrors. This dependence is modulated by a wavelength-scale oscillation of\nthe friction force, which thereby follows the same oscillatory dependence as mirror mediated cooling [8, 9] and\nconstrains cooling to regions of the size of \u03bb0 /8, where\n\u03bb0 = 2\u03c0/k0 . In the case of a micro-mechanical mirror,\nwhere the vibrational amplitude is naturally much less\nthan the wavelength, this presents no problem. The form\nof Eq. (5) is dependent on the properties of the scatterer\nand of the mirrors; for realistic mirrors and \u03b6 = 1, the\nenhancement factor 0.17F drops to 0.04F . With typical\nexperimental parameters this results in an enhancement\nof 103 \u2013104 over the standard setup; e.g., in Ref.

If we denote the complex reflectivities of the near and far mirror\nby r and R, respectively, we can show that the peaks\nof Fig. 2 lie around the cavity \u0001resonances, at approximately L = 12 m\u03bb0 \u2212 2k10 arg rR , with m being an integer, and have approximately\np the \u0001same full-width at half\u0001\nmaximum, 1 \u2212 |rR| / k0 |rR| . The enhancement of\nthe friction force by the cavity is due to the multiplication of the retardation time by the number of round\ntrips in the cavity, which thereby acts as a 'distance folding' mechanism. For the chosen parameters, the optical\npath length is effectively 2x + 0.04F L; i.e., determined\npredominantly by the cavity length L.\nThe friction force depends not only upon the retardation but also upon the cavity reflectivity, which drops\nnear resonance in the well-known behaviour of a Fabry\u2013\nP\u00e9rot resonator. Fig. 3 shows the friction amplitude as a\nfunction of the near mirror transmissivity |t| for a fixed\nfar mirror transmissivity, T = 1/(1 \u2212 100i). We note that\nthis nonideal reflectivity of the far mirror could equivalently arise from absorption, of ca. 0.01% with the given\nparameters, of the incident power by the mirror. For each\nvalue of |t|, the cavity length L has been adjusted to maximize the friction force, according to curves such as those\nin Fig. 2.

When this causes a dip in the friction amplitude peak, the optimum values plotted in Fig. 3 occur\nto either side of the resonance, and the friction force in\nthis region is effectively limited by this interference effect.\nWe note that the friction amplitude is not maximized at\nthe point of maximum intra-cavity field (t = T ) because\nmore light is lost through the cavity for larger |t|.\nThe external cavity cooling mechanism of Fig. 1(b)\nmay prove particularly valuable when the scatterer is a\nsmall mirror or other micro-mechanical optical component. In such cases, the advantage gained by using the\nexternal cavity over the standard optomechanical cooling\nscheme, Fig. 1(c), depends heavily upon the polarizability or reflectivity of the moving scatterer, which in the\nabove calculations have so far been taken to be modest\n(\u03b6 = 1; |r| = 0.7) in comparison with those of the cavity mirrors. For \u03b6 \u226a 1, the friction force is enhanced\nby a factor approximately equal to F because of the distance folding argument explained above. For larger \u03b6,\nthe system turns into a three\u2013mirror resonator and the\nadvantage of external cavity cooling is not as big, but is\nstill significant. For \u03b6 \u2248 1 we find enhancement by a factor 0.04F , as discussed above. For even larger \u03b6, when\nthe reflectivity of the moving mirror becomes comparable\nto that of the fixed mirrors, the scheme behaves similarly\nto the mirror mediated cooling configuration. The main\nheating process that counteracts the cooling effect in the\ncase of micromirrors is thermal coupling to the environment, which depends on the geometry. In the case of\nisolated scatterers that undergo no absorption, the heating is due to quantum fluctuations in the\u0001fields [9]; the\nlimit temperature here is \u2248 h\u0304c/ 0.34kB F L when \u03b6 \u226a 1,\nwhich evaluates to \u2248 0.1 mK for the parameters in Fig. 3.\nThe usual cavity mediated cooling mechanism [11, 12],\nwhere the moving scatterer is inside a two-mirror cavity,\n\ncan also be described by our general framework in terms\nof Eqs. (2) and (4). Compared with this scheme, external cavity cooling has the advantage of always having a\nsinusoidal spatial dependence; the narrow resonances in\nthe friction force for well-localized particles in a far-off\nresonance trap inside a cavity [13], for example, impose\nmore stringent positioning requirements. On the other\nhand, whereas scatterers travelling distances of many\nwavelengths within a cavity can experience a net cooling force [14], the friction force outside a cavity averages to zero; we find, however, that a net cooling effect\narises in a similar geometry in three dimensions which\nmay be particularly significant for micro-mechanical systems [15]. Finally, we note that when the scatterer is\noutside, rather than within, the cavity the local field is\nnot amplified by the resonator and the incident field can\ntherefore be made much stronger without causing saturation (when the moving scatterer is an atom) or damage\n(when it is a mirror).\nThis work was supported by the UK EPSRC\n(EP/E039839/1 and EP/E058949/1), by the CMMC\ncollaboration within the EuroQUAM programme of\nthe ESF, and by the NSF (NF68736) and NORT\n(ERC HU 09 OPTOMECH) of Hungary.\n\n\u2217\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n\nCorresponding\nauthor.\nElectronic\naddress: andre.xuereb@soton.ac.uk\nF.

A tightly confined laser beam interacting with a trapped\nparticle experiences a phase shift, which upon reflection from a mirror or resonant microstructure\nproduces a time-delayed optical potential for the particle. This leads to a nonconservative force and\nfriction. A quantum model of the system is presented and analyzed in the semiclassical limit.\nKey words: Particle cooling; optical trapping; micro-resonators\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nII.\n\nCONCEPTUAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN\nOPTICAL COOLING METHODS\n\nStandard techniques for optical cooling of atoms\nmostly rely on spontaneous emission from the atom to\ncarry away the excess momentum. This basic process\nhas been demonstrated to be highly efficient for cooling\nof two-level or multi-level atoms and for various laser\nconfigurations in one, two, or three dimensions, applying\nvarious polarization states and frequencies1 . However,\na common requirement is for the atom to exhibit a single, albeit possibly degenerate, ground state such that\nno atomic population is lost from the cooling cycle by\npopulation transfer into internal states decoupled from\nthe laser light. These cooling mechanisms are thus not\nwell suited for most atomic species and hardly for any\nmolecules at all.\nCavity-mediated cooling mechanisms2,3,4,5 have been\nsuggested to address these shortcomings of laser cooling\nmethods. In this case, only a dipole interaction between\nthe particles and a near resonant cavity mode is required.\nWhile this can be fulfilled for a much larger variety of\nparticles, resonator alignment and loading of the particles\ninto the small mode volume of an appropriate cavity is\ndifficult.\nWe have recently proposed an alternative method for\ncooling particles that exhibit an electric dipole moment\nbut no closed transitions6 . In this 'mirror-mediated cooling' scheme, a laser-driven particle interacts with its own\nimage in a mirror and the time-delay incurred during the\nreflection is exploited to introduce a non-conservative element into the dipole force, thereby leading to friction and\ncooling. This time delay may be induced by a delay line,\ne.g., an optical fiber, but more conveniently could arise\nfrom an integrated optical micro-resonator7,8,9,10,11 , possibly combined with a plasmonic microstructure for local\nfield enhancement12,13 .\nHere we investigate the challenges involved in modeling this novel cooling mechanism. We discuss how the required processes differ from free-space or cavity-mediated\nlaser-cooling methods and propose a theory to overcome\nthese new difficulties. We finally discuss the main results\nobtained from our method.\n\nFIG. 1: Schematics of optical cooling methods: (a) Freespace laser cooling, (b) cavity-mediated cooling of a particle\nbetween two partially reflective mirrors, (c) mirror-mediated\ncooling of a particle using one perfectly reflecting and one\npartially reflective mirror.\n\nWe start our discussion with a brief review of the fundamental concepts behind three different laser cooling\nschemes: (i) free-space laser cooling, (ii) cavity-mediated\ncooling, and (iii) mirror-mediated cooling.\nFree-space laser cooling methods, such as Doppler\ncooling14 , polarization gradient cooling15 , or velocityselected coherent population trapping16 , utilize a number\nof laser beams focused from various directions on a small\nsample of atoms, as illustrated in Fig. 1(a). In each case,\nthe laser and atomic configuration is set up in such a\nway that the atom-light coupling is velocity-dependent.\nFor example, the photon scattering rate or the spatial\npositions where scattering predominantly happens can\ndepend on the atomic velocity, leading to an average net\ncooling effect. The excess momentum of hot atoms is\nthereby transferred to spontaneously emitted photons. A\nmathematical description of the cooling mechanism thus\n\n\f2\ncontains a number of classical, stationary laser beams,\nand a quantum description of the atomic degrees of freedom. To remove the excess momentum, the excited states\nof the atoms are coupled to a heat bath, which is assumed\nto be memory-less (Markovian)17 .\nIn cavity-mediated cooling schemes2,3,4,5 , Fig. 1(b),\nthe atoms sit inside an optical resonator and are coupled\nto one or a few resonator modes, while laser beams are\nused to pump the resonator through its mirrors. Dipole\ncoupling transfers excess momentum coherently from the\natoms to the cavity modes, which subsequently decay\nthrough the partially-transmitting mirrors. Mathematically, the classical stationary laser beams are now coupled to a quantum system comprising the atom degrees\nof freedom and the quantum state of the discrete cavity\nmodes. The modes in turn are coupled to a Markovian\nheat bath.\nIn mirror-mediated cooling, finally, the particles sit\noutside a coherent delay device, Fig. 1(c), which could be\nas simple as a single mirror, a piece of optical fiber with\nan inscribed Bragg grating, or formed by an integrated\noptical resonator on a chip7,8,9,10,11 . Via the dipole coupling, the particle imprints a phase on the pump beam\nwhich returns to the position of the particle after reflection with a time delay. Hence, the total dipole potential\nexperienced by the particle depends on the interference of\nthe incoming beam with the time-delayed reflected beam.\nIf the particle has moved during the light round trip, this\nleads to a non-conservative force that can be exploited\nfor extracting energy from the particle motion. A mathematical description of this situation therefore requires\ntwo key ingredients, different from free-space cooling and\ncavity-mediated cooling: (i) the pump beam itself must\nbe described as dynamic, and (ii) cooling relies on the\nsystem state at an earlier time, thus it is non-Markovian.\nOn the other hand, no heat bath is required.\nInstead of introducing a system memory in time, we\nmay also decompose the field into a continuum of modes.\nThe model presented here will follow this latter approach.\nFor the sake of simplicity, we model the polarizable particle as a single two-level atom and assume that the time\ndelay arises from a significant distance (several meters)\nbetween the atom and the mirror. However, it is envisaged that in a practical realization the time delay will\narise from reflection by an integrated micro-optical resonator or a similar structure. Moreover, we restrict the\nanalysis to a single spatial dimension. The electromagnetic modes at angular frequency \u03c9 thus are standing\nwaves with mode functions f (\u03c9, x) = sin(\u03c9x/c) if the\nmirror is assumed at x = 0. Upon adiabatic elimination\nof the internal degrees of freedom of the atom, and treating atomic motion semiclassically, we obtain a continuum\nquantum model governed by the Hamiltonian\n\u0124 =\n\nZ\n\nh\u0304(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c90 )\u00e2\u2020 (\u03c9)\u00e2(\u03c9)d\u03c9\nZZ\ng2\n\u03c92 x \u2020\n\u03c91 x\n+h\u0304\nsin\n\u00e2 (\u03c91 )\u00e2(\u03c92 )d\u03c91 d\u03c92 (1)\nsin\n\u2206\nc\nc\n\nwhere \u00e2(\u03c9) and \u00e2\u2020 (\u03c9) are the mode annihilation and creation operators, \u2206 is the detuning of the atom from the\ndriving laser, and g is the atom-field coupling constant.\nFor a two-level atom with transition wavelength \u03bb and\nexcited state decay rate 2\u0393, this coupling constant is related to the mode beam waist w by18\n2\u03c0g 2 = \u0393\n\n4\u03c3a\n\u03c0w2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03c3a = 3\u03bb2 /(2\u03c0) is the atomic radiative cross section. The force operator describing the action of the field\non an atom at position x is derived from the Hamiltonian\nas\nF\u0302 (x) = \u2212\n\nd\u0124\n.\ndx\n\n(3)\n\nWe note that the general form of the inter-modal coupling given by the Hamiltonian (1) is valid for any pointlike dipole scatterer, and thus will also hold for general\nmulti-level atoms and molecules. Moreover, in order to\ncalculate the force (3) we are interested only in the time\nevolution of the field in the vicinity of the particle. Hence,\nit is mainly the relative phase between the mode functions at this position which is important. We thus conclude that, instead of free-space propagation, any dispersive optical device could be used as a delay element,\nwhich in particular includes resonant micro- or nanostructures.\nIII.\n\nPERTURBATIVE SOLUTION OF THE\nMODEL\n\nIn the following we apply perturbation theory to the\nmodel introduced above to derive the basic properties of\nthe proposed cooling method. We work in the Heisenberg picture where the mode operators become time dependent with the dynamics governed by\ni\nd\ni h\n\u0124, \u00e2(\u03c9, t)\n\u00e2(\u03c9, t) =\ndt\nh\u0304\n= \u2212i(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c90 )\u00e2(\u03c9, t)\nZ\n\u03c9x\n\u03c91 x\ng2\n\u00e2(\u03c91 , t)d\u03c91 . (4)\nsin\n\u2212 i sin\n\u2206\nc\nc\nNext, we apply a semiclassical approximation for the field\nmodes assuming that the state of every mode is given\nby a coherent state at all times. This is tantamount to\nreplacing the operator \u00e2(\u03c9, t) by its expectation value\na(\u03c9, t). We assume that the atom follows a linear trajectory x(t) = x + v(t \u2212 t0 ) such that at a time t0 \u226b 2\u03c4 the\natom is at position x. Here, 2\u03c4 = 2x/c is the round-trip\ntime of the delayed reflection. We then expand the mode\namplitudes into powers of both the coupling g 2 /\u2206 and\nthe atom velocity v,\na(\u03c9, t) = a0 (\u03c9, t) +\n\ng2\n[a1 (\u03c9, t) + vb1 (\u03c9, t)] + * * * .

Inserting (5) with (6) into (4), one can derive\nthe first order terms in g 2 /\u2206 analytically by perturbation\ntheory yielding\n\n0\n\n10\n\n\u22121\n\nCooling time 1/\u03c1 (s)\n\nThe zeroth order term in g 2 /\u2206 corresponds to the field\nwithout back action of the atom. It is thus independent\nof v and represents the unperturbed driving laser field,\nwhich is assumed to be monochromatic,\n\n10\n\n\u22122\n\n10\n\n\u22123\n\n10\n\n\u22124\n\n10\n\n\u22125\n\n10\n\nExpressions (5)-(8) can then be inserted into (3) to calculate the leading terms of the force experienced by the\natom at position x at time t0 . Most interesting is the\nfirst-order term of the force in velocity v, since this gives\nthe linear friction force and thus describes heating or\ncooling of the atom in the proposed setup. We find\nFv (x, t0 ) =\n\n2\u03c0h\u0304k02 v\u03c4 |A|2\n\ng4\nsin(4k0 x)\n\u22062\n\n(9)\n\nin leading order of x/\u03bb. Here, k0 = \u03c90 /c is the pump\nwavenumber. Note that Fv is independent of time. We\nnow define the spatially dependent friction coefficient\n\u03c1(x) by the relation Fv (x) = \u2212\u03c1(x)mv and introduce the\natomic saturation parameter s = |A|2 g 2 /\u22062 at the maximum of the standing-wave pump. Together with (2) this\nyields\n\u03c1(x) = \u22124s\u0393\n\n\u03c3a h\u0304k02\n\u03c4 sin(4k0 x)\n\u03c0w2 m\n\n(10)\n\nwhich has units of s\u22121 and therefore relates to the inverse\nof the cooling or heating time.\nFig. 2 shows the dependence of the 1/e cooling time\nfor rubidium atoms at a point of maximum friction,\nsin(4k0 x) = \u22121, on the beam waist and for different delay times ranging from 1 ns to 1 \u03bcs. Note that this plot\nassumes constant saturation s and thus the pump laser\npower is assumed to increase linearly with the mode area.\nThe figure predicts that cooling times of the order of ms\ncan be achieved if the pump is tightly focussed at the\natom and the delay time is of the order of tens of ns.\nLonger delays lead to faster cooling. These conditions\nare comparable with those explored experimentally in,\nfor example, Ref. 19.\nAn important feature of the friction coefficient (10) is\nits spatial dependence with sin(4k0 x).

Significant cooling via this method thus requires\nlocalizing the atom in an additional trap. In practice\nthis could be achieved by an additional far-off resonant\nbeam either propagating parallel to the mirror or forming another standing wave superimposed on the driving\nbeam for the cooling. Alternatively, on-chip microtraps\ncan be utilized in conjunction with integrated time-delay\nreflectors. In the following, we will assume a harmonic\ntrapping potential.

For trap sizes \u03b4 >\n\u223c 0.15\u03bb cooling finally turns\ninto heating as the atom spends more time in regions\nof the standing-wave pump where the mirror-mediated\nforce accelerates the atom.\nSo far, we have neglected momentum diffusion due to\nspontaneous scattering of photons by the atom, which together with the friction coefficient determines the stationary temperature achievable with this system. To zeroth\norder in the atom-field coupling, momentum diffusion is\ndue to the interaction with the unperturbed pump field.\nWe may thus expect diffusion to be identical to that observed in free-space Doppler cooling, where the diffusion\nconstant is given by14\nD = h\u03042 k02 \u0393s.\n\n(12)\n\nFrom this the stationary temperature is obtained as\nkB T =\n\nD\nh\u0304 \u03c0w2\n\u22121\n=\nm\u03c1(x)\n\u03c4 4\u03c3a sin(4k0 x)\n\n(13)\n\nwhere for simplicity we have used the non-averaged value\nof the friction (10). This is a remarkably simple expression which, apart from the spatial dependence, only depends on the delay time and the beam cross section. Fig.\n4 shows the stationary temperatures corresponding to the\nfriction curves of Fig. 2. For realistic parameters these\nsimple analytic results predict stationary temperatures\nof the order of mK or even slightly below and thus less\nthan an order of magnitude above the Doppler limit of\n141 \u03bcK for Rb atoms. However, we emphasize again that\nthe cooling in our scheme is based on the dipole force, in\ncontrast to free-space Doppler cooling which relies on the\nradiation pressure force. As such, mirror-mediated cooling uniquely also works in the far-off resonant regime.\n\nIn addition to the perturbative solution of the system\ndynamics, we also performed numerical Monte-Carlo simulations. These semiclassical simulations have a number\nof advantages: (i) they allow us to include the harmonic\ndipole trap consistently, (ii) they provide solutions to any\norder in the coupling g 2 /\u2206 and in the velocity v, and (iii)\nthey include momentum and photon number diffusion.\nOn the other hand, the numerical treatment requires us\nto restrict the analysis to a discrete set of equally spaced\nmodes of angular frequencies \u03c9k .\nThe corresponding set of equations is derived following\nthe approach of Refs. 20 which we only very briefly outline here. Starting from the full quantum master equation including quantized atomic motion and a Liouvilletype term for spontaneous atomic decay, a Wigner transform is applied to obtain a Fokker-Planck equation for\nthe joint Wigner function of the complex mode field amplitudes \u03b1k and the atomic momentum p and position x.\nIn the semiclassical approximation, this Fokker-Planck\nequation is equivalent to the following set of stochastic\ndifferential equations:\np\ndx =\ndt,\n(14)\nm\n\u0003\n\u0002\nd\nd\ndp = i\u03b3 E(x) E \u2217 (x) \u2212 E \u2217 (x) E(x) dt\ndx\ndx\n\u0003\n\u0002\nd\nd\n\u2212U0 E(x) E \u2217 (x) + E \u2217 (x) E(x) dt\ndx\ndx\n+kt (x \u2212 x0 )dt + dP,\n(15)\nd\u03b1k = i\u2206k \u03b1k dt \u2212 (iU0 + \u03b3)E(x)fk\u2217 (x)dt + dAk , (16)\nP\nwhere E(x) = k \u03b1k sin(\u03c9k x/c) is the total field amplitude at x, xt and kt are the position of the trap center\nand the trap spring constant, respectively, and \u03b3 and U0\nare the atomic scattering rate and the optical potential\nper photon, respectively. The terms dP and dAk are correlated stochastic white-noise terms describing the spontaneous redistribution of photons between modes by the\nscattering atom and the subsequent fluctuations in atom\nmomentum and modal photon numbers.

Parameters are for\nRb atoms, \u2206 = \u221210\u0393, \u03c4 = 0.25/\u0393, w = 0.7 \u03bcm, \u2206\u03c9 = 0.1\u0393,\n\u03c9t = 0.5 \u00d7 2\u03c0\u0393, s = 0.076. The trap is centered at a point of\nmaximum friction.\n\npropagation times for ensembles of different initial temperatures and derive linear approximations for the rate of\ntemperature change dT /dt. Numerically, we found that\nthis approach works well, however great care is required\nin the data analysis and fitting routines as outlined in\nthe following.\nFigure 5 shows the principles of our data analysis routines for the example of a single particle trajectory, where\nmomentum diffusion was neglected for the sake of clarity.\nAn atom with an initial momentum of 100 h\u0304k0 oscillates\nin a trap with trap frequency \u03c9t , Fig. 5(a). A closer look\nat the maxima of the momentum oscillations, Fig. 5(b),\nreveals the cooling effect due to friction. Note that this\neffect is small, only of the order of 10\u22124 for the period\nof time shown here. It is therefore necessary to remove\nthe fundamental oscillation with very high accuracy from\nthe simulated data, as it can otherwise easily mask the\neffects of friction.\nOne possibility (method 1) is to fit each single oscillation with a harmonic motion. From these fits the positions and momentum amplitudes of the individual oscillations are obtained, as indicated by the crosses in the\nfigure. Finally, a linear fit to these data points provides\nan accurate measure of the averaged friction coefficient\nwhich can be compared to the analytic result (11). An\n\nalternative method (method 2) to extract the friction coefficient from a trajectory, or from an ensemble average\nover many trajectories in the presence of noise, is shown\nin Fig. 5(c). In this case, a single sine function is fitted\nto the trajectory and subtracted from it. The result is\na curve where the large amplitude oscillations have been\nremoved. A linear fit to this curve reveals the average\nslope and thus the friction coefficient. Both methods, 1\nand 2, work well within certain parameter limits, with\nmethod 1 in general being more accurate but method 2\nbeing quicker to evaluate.\nThe results of one set of simulations of the full system\nof stochastic differential equations (14)-(16) are shown in\nFig. 6. Simulations were performed in ensembles of 104\nindependent trajectories, where the initial conditions of\neach ensemble were chosen to represent an atomic cloud\nat a given temperature. Every trajectory was propagated\nfor a time 60 \u0393\u22121 , and ensemble averages of the squared\nmomentum were taken as a measure of the ensemble temperature as a function of time. Finally, method 2 as\noutlined above was employed to extract a linear approximation to the cooling rate dT /dt. The numerical errors\nrelated to the finite number of simulations per ensemble\nwere estimated by applying the same analysis to subensembles of 103 trajectories.\nFigure 6 shows that the numerically obtained values\nof dT /dt are well approximated by a linear function of\ninitial temperature. This linear behavior is expected for\nBrownian motion with linear friction. For very small initial temperatures, momentum diffusion dominates and\nthe ensemble temperature increases with time. For large\ninitial temperatures, on the other hand, friction dominates and the ensemble is cooled. The stationary temperature where the two effects cancel is obtained as\nT = 0.69 \u00b1 0.17 mK from the linear fit to the data with\nGaussian error propagation. By comparison, the simple analytic estimate (13) predicts a temperature of 0.76\nmK, which is in surprisingly good agreement given the\n\n\f6\nnumber of approximations made in the derivation of the\nperturbative result.\nV.\n\nOUTLOOK: APPLICATION TO MICROAND NANODEVICES\n\nIn the analysis presented above, the delay time was\nprovided by a meter-scale distance between the particle\nand the mirror. However, we envisage various routes for\nintegration of this cooling scheme into microchip devices,\nas outlined in the following.\nMicroresonators.\nThe necessary delay time can\nbe conveniently achieved using an integrated optical\nresonator7,8,9,10,11 instead of a delay line. For example, a\n10 ns delay requires a resonator quality factor of Q \u2248 107 ,\nwhich is well within the limits of state-of-the-art microsphere or microdisk resonators. The friction coefficient \u03c1\nwill then correspond to the average of Eq. (10) over the\ndelay time \u03c4 for light exiting the resonator after 1, 2, 3,\netc. roundtrips.\nPlasmonic field enhancement. In free space, the minimum beam diameter is limited by diffraction to about\none optical wavelength. However, it has been shown that\nmicroantennas can vastly enhance local field intensities\nby plasmon effects, and enhancement factors of 300 have\nalready been demonstrated13 . If the particle could be\nplaced inside such a microantenna, the geometric factor\n\u03c3a /(\u03c0w2 ) would effectively be increased by this factor,\nleading to significantly faster, more efficient cooling.\nOptomechanics.

This model allows us\nto treat multi-level atoms as classical scatterers in light fields modified by, in principle, arbitrarily\ncomplex optical components such as mirrors, resonators, dispersive or dichroic elements, or filters.\nWe verify our formalism for two prototypical sub-Doppler cooling mechanisms and show that it\nagrees with the standard literature.\nPACS numbers: 42.50.Wk; 37.10.De; 37.10.Vz; 42.70.Qs\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe two-level model of atoms interacting with light\nfields [1] has often been used to explore optical cooling mechanisms [2, 3, 4]. Its inherent simplicity-the\natom has one ground state and one excited state-makes\nthe resulting models amenable to analysis, but also suppresses mechanisms [5] that, in the appropriate parameter regimes, dominate the interaction.\nA notable example of such an initially overlooked\nmechanism in atomic physics is three-dimensional optical molasses [6]. By means of the two-level model,\none can predict the equilibrium temperature, the socalled \"Doppler\" temperature TD , of atoms in molasses\nto be ~\u0393, where \u0393 is the (half-width at half-maximum)\nlinewidth of the transition from the excited to the ground\nlevel [4]. Data from early three-dimensional molasses experiments contradicted this [7], showing that the achievable equilibrium temperature was in fact much lower.\nThis discrepancy was resolved independently by two\ngroups [5, 8], both explanations relying on the inclusion of the manifold of magnetic sublevels in each of the\nground and excited states. In particular, the motion of\nthe atoms in the optical field leads to a non-adiabatic following of the magnetic sublevel populations, which gives\nrise to a strong viscous force and efficient cooling to temperatures significantly lower than the Doppler temperature.\nWe recently [9] explored a new scattering theory that\ndeals with the interaction of light and matter in a unified form applicable from microscopic to macroscopic systems. In that work we only considered the two-level atom\nmodel and showed, in particular, how our model can explain such mechanisms as standard optical molasses and\nmirror-mediated cooling [10]. In this paper we extend\nthis model to deal with magnetic sublevels, in much the\n\nFIG. 1: Moving scatterer interacting with four field modes\nrepresented by the Jones vectors A, B, C, and D. The scatterwe has velocity v and is described by means of its polarizability tensor \u03b6. The field mode amplitudes are, in general,\nfunctions of the wavenumber k.\n\nsame spirit as ref. [5]. In due course, this extension will\nenable us to deal with multilevel atoms interacting with\nan arbitrarily complex system composed of immobile mirrors, cavities, MEMS devices, etc., without resorting to\na quantized model for such a system.\nAfter we introduce the general extension in the next\nsection, we then proceed to explore two prototypical\nsystems-the J = 12 \u2192 J \u2032 = 23 transition, leading to the\n\"Sisyphus\" cooling mechanism, and the J = 1 \u2192 J \u2032 = 2\ntransition-in Section III and Section IV, respectively.\n\nII.\n\nA TRANSFER MATRIX RELATING JONES\nVECTORS\n\nWe investigate the interaction of atoms with light of\ndifferent polarizations. To this end, we denote the two\npolarization basis vectors by \u03bc and \u03bd, whereby the standard circular polarization basis is equivalent to setting\n\u03bc = \u03c3 + and \u03bd = \u03c3 \u2212 . Starting from the transfer matrix model explored in ref. [9] and using the definitions\nin Fig. 1, we replace each of the field modes by a corresponding Jones vector, similar to the model used in\nref. [11]. Thus, for example,\nA(k) \u2192 A(k) =\n\n\u2217 To whom all correspondence should be addressed.

A general\nrecipe for transforming the formulae for the field mode\namplitudes, as given in ref. [9], can be summarized by\nmeans of the two replacements\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1 0\nand \u03b6 \u2192 \u03b6 ,\n(4)\n1\u21921=\n0 1\nwherever necessary.

[12], Complement EIII \u00a73-b, in defining\nthe polarizability tensor \u03b6 as the steady-state expectation\nvalue of the polarizability operator \u03c7\u0302; \u03b6 is therefore given\nby the trace\n\u0001 X\nhj|\u03c1st |iihi|\u03c7\u0302|ji ,\n(6)\n\u03b6 = Tr \u03c1st * \u03c7\u0302 =\ni,j\n\nwhere \u03c1st is the steady-state density matrix describing\nthe system and the summation runs over all the internal\nsublevels of the atom, and where we construct the order\n4 polarizability operator tensor \u03c7\u0302 similarly to ref. [13],\nEq. (14.9-24). In the general \u03bc, \u03bd basis:\n!\n!\nX hi|d\u02c6\u03bc |ei\nhj|d\u02c6\u03bc |ei\nhi|\u03c7\u0302|ji = \u03b60\n\u2297\nhi|d\u02c6\u03bd |ei\nhj|d\u02c6\u03bd |ei\ne\n\"\n#\nX hi|d\u02c6\u03bc |eihe|d\u02c6\u03bc |ji hi|d\u02c6\u03bc |eihe|d\u02c6\u03bd |ji\n= \u03b60\n, (7)\nhi|d\u02c6\u03bd |eihe|d\u02c6\u03bc |ji hi|d\u02c6\u03bd |eihe|d\u02c6\u03bd |ji\ne\nwith \u03b60 being the characteristic polarizability of the\natom. In Eq. (7), the dipole moment operator d\u02c6\u03bc (d\u02c6\u03bd )\nis related to the \u03bc (\u03bd) polarized light field and the sum\nruns over all the internal sublevels, e, of the atom. The\nmatrix elements of d\u02c6\u03bc (d\u02c6\u03bd ) are given by the appropriate\nClebsch-Gordan coefficients.\nImportantly, this new transfer matrix still retains all\nits properties, allowing us to model the interaction of the\nmultilevel atom with an arbitrary system of immobile optical elements such as mirrors, cavities, waveplates, etc.\nAs in our previous work [9], this interaction is accounted\nfor by the multiplication of the various transfer matrices\nof the elements making up the system; this model is, in\nprinciple, applicable to systems of arbitrary complexity.\nFinally, we recall that the diagonal elements, hi|\u03c1st |ii,\nof \u03c1st are the populations in each of the sublevels,\n\nFIG. 2: Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for a J =\ntransition.\n\n1\n2\n\n\u2192 J\u2032 =\n\n3\n2\n\nwhereas its off-diagonal elements, hi|\u03c1st |ji, are the\nrespective coherences. The matrix elements of \u03c1st are\nobtained from the appropriate optical Bloch equations\n(see, for example, the procedure outlined in ref. [14]).\nWe note here that, through its dependence on \u03c1st , M\ndepends on the fields that it helps to determine, and\nthus Eq. (2) will in general become a set of nonlinear\nequations. In cases, like the ones considered in the\nfollowing sections, where only one multilevel atom is\ninteracting with a linear optical system, this problem\nmay be solved using a procedure similar to the one\noutlined below: the fields surrounding the atom are\nobtained from the input fields through linear operations\nand then used with the optical Bloch equations to obtain\nthe populations and coherences of the atom's various\nlevels. Knowledge of these quantities then determines\nthe fields, and hence the forces acting on the atom,\ncompletely.\nIn the following sections we will restrict our discussion to the case where the input field is not modified by\nother transfer matrices. We will apply this mechanism\nto investigate the behaviour of atoms in two cases where\nthe polarization of the light varies in space on scales of\nthe order of the wavelength to verify the validity of the\nmodel given by Eq. (5) to Eq. (7). In the first instance,\nwe illuminate our atom with two counterpropagating linearly polarized beams. We choose the planes of polarization of the two beams to be orthogonal to each other.\nThe second configuration we will investigate involves illuminating the atom with two circularly polarized beams,\nchoosing opposite handedness for the two beams. These\ntwo cases mirror those in ref. [5].\nIII.\n\nATOMS IN A GRADIENT OF\nPOLARIZATION\n\nIn this and the following sections, we will adopt the\nlow-intensity hypothesis. This allows us to simplify the\noptical Bloch equations and resulting system considerably by neglecting the populations and coherences of the\nexcited state sublevels. We can thus replace \u03c1st by the\nground state steady-state density matrix, \u03c1st\ng . We denote the diagonal element (i, i) of \u03c1st\ng , the population in\nsublevel i, by \u03a0i , and the off-diagonal element (i, j), the\n\n\f3\ncoherence between sublevels i and j, by Ci,j .\nHere we will discuss what is perhaps the simplest transition between two levels with multiple magnetic sublevels: the J = 12 \u2192 J \u2032 = 32 transition. In this case, we\nhave two ground sublevels so that \u03c1st\ng is a 2 \u00d7 2 matrix.\nFig. 2 tabulates the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients required\nto evaluate \u03b6.

The\nvelocity-dependent force terms in the above expression\narise through the Doppler shifting of photons both between field modes in the same polarization and between\nfield modes in different polarizations; these mechanisms\nare accounted for by the diagonal and off-diagonal terms\nin \u03b6, respectively.

We have applied this theory to two standard subDoppler cooling configurations, the so-called \"lin\u2013\u22a5\u2013lin\"\nand \"\u03c3 + \u2013\u03c3 \u2212 \" configurations, and thereby reproduced the\nknown expressions for the force acting on the atom.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by the UK Engineering\nand Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) grant\nEP/E058949/1 and by the Cavity-Mediated Molecular\nCooling network within the EuroQUAM programme of\nthe European Science Foundation (ESF), as well as by\nthe National Scientific Fund of Hungary (Contract No.\nNF68736).\n\nSoc.

Our model introduces two additional features to the cavity:\nan isolator is used to prevent circulation and resonant enhancement of the pump laser field and thus to avoid\nsaturation of or damage to the scatterer, and an optical amplifier is used to enhance the effective Q-factor of the\ncounterpropagating mode and thus to increase the velocity-dependent forces by amplifying the back-scattered\nlight. We calculate friction forces, momentum diffusion, and steady-state temperatures to demonstrate the\nadvantages of the proposed setup.\nKeywords: optomechanics; cavity cooling; ring cavities; optical forces; gain media\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction and Motivation\n\nFree-space laser cooling [1] has proven to be remarkably successful in cooling simple atomic\nsystems, especially alkali atoms [2]. Relying on the availability of a (quasi-)closed two-level [3]\nor multi-level [4, 5] system, however, only occasional successes were had with more complicated\nsystems, such as molecules [6, 7]. An alternative to such schemes is cavity\u2013mediated cooling [8\u2013\n11], where the interaction of a polarisable particle with a cavity field leads to a Sisyphus\u2013type\nmechanism [12] that can cool the motion of the particle; no specific energy level scheme is required\nfor this mechanism to operate. Much of this work has been focused on standing-wave (Fabry\u2013\nP\u00e9rot) cavities, where high Q-factors can be achieved experimentally to significantly enhance\noptomechanical forces. However, in the limit of strong scatterers, friction forces in standingwave cavities become increasingly position-dependent [13], which limits the overall, averaged\ncooling efficiency. This can be overcome by using ring cavities [14\u201321] where the translational\nsymmetry guarantees position-independent forces. On the other hand, ring cavities are usually\nmuch larger and of lower Q-factor than their standing-wave counterparts. Using a gain medium\ninside a ring cavity has been proposed [22, 23] to offset these losses, allowing one to effectively\n'convert' a low-Q cavity into a high-Q one, and thus to increase the effective optomechanical\ninteraction by orders of magnitude. This same concept has also been raised in connection with\nusing optical parametric amplifiers in standard optomechanical systems [24]. Research is also\nbeing conducted into using nonlinear media inside cavities [25] as a tool to control the dynamics\nof a micromechanical oscillator. Another application of ring cavities is in the investigation of\ncollective atomic recoil lasing (CARL) [26], which exploits the spontaneous self-organisation of\nan atomic ensemble within a ring cavity, induced by a strong pump beam, to amplify a probe\nbeam through Doppler-shifted reflection of the pump. The gain medium is in this case the atomic\nensemble itself.\n\u2217 Corresponding\n\nauthor.

(a) Physical schematic of a polarisable particle in a unidirectional ring cavity, showing the input field B\u0302in .\n(b) Equivalent 'transfer matrix'\u2013style (unfolded) model; the particle is drawn on both sides of this schematic to illustrate\nthe recursive nature of the cavity. The various components are defined in Section 2.\n\nHere, we investigate a different system that shares several features with the above mechanisms.\nIn particular, we consider a particle inside a ring cavity that includes a gain medium, spatially\nseparated from the particle. An isolator is also included in the ring cavity, in such a way as to\nprevent the pump beam from circulating in the cavity and being amplified; this ensures that\nthe intensity of the field surrounding the particle is always low and thereby circumvents any\nproblems caused by atomic saturation or mirror burning. The Doppler-shifted reflection of the\npump from the particle is, on the other hand, allowed to circulate, and its amplification in turn\nenhances the velocity-dependent forces acting on the particle.\nIn such a situation, one is able to take advantage of properties inherent to the ring cavity\nsystem, such as the fact that the forces acting on the particle do not exhibit any sub-wavelength\nspatial modulation; this is due to the translational symmetry present in the system [14]. Moreover, modest amplification allows one to use optical fibres to form the ring cavity, opening the\ndoor towards increasing the optical length of such cavities. The optomechanical force is, as\nwe will see and in the parameter domain of interest, linearly dependent on the cavity length;\nlengthening the cavity thus provides further enhancement of the interaction.\nThis paper is structured as follows. We shall first introduce the physical model, which we\nproceed to solve using the transfer matrix method (TMM) [27] to obtain the friction force and\nmomentum diffusion acting on the particle. In the good-cavity limit, Section 2.1, simple expressions for these quantities can be obtained, yielding further insight into the system and allowing\nus to draw some parallels with traditional cavity cooling. In this limit, our model becomes\nequivalent to one based on a standard master equation approach [14] as outlined in Section 2.2.\nRealistic numerical values for the various parameters are then used in Section 3 to explore the\nefficiency and limits of the cooling mechanism. Finally, we will conclude by mentioning some\npossible extensions to the scheme.\n\n2.\n\nGeneral expressions and equilibrium behaviour\n\nThe mathematical model of the ring cavity system, schematically drawn in Fig. 1(a), is shown\nin Fig. 1(b). A particle, characterised by its polarisability \u03b6, is in a ring cavity of round-trip\nlength L. C1,3 are the couplers, between which the particle lies, that terminate the fibre-based\ncavity, and C2 is the input coupler that injects a pump beam with wavenumber k0 into one of\nthe travelling modes of the cavity. The couplers Ci (i = 1, 2, 3) have (amplitude) reflection and\ntransmission coefficients ri and ti = ri + 1, respectively, and are associated with corresponding\nnoise modes \u00cai . Similarly, the particle itself couples a noise mode \u00ca into the system with an\namplitude \u01eb depending on \u03b6. The length scales l1 > lA > l2 > l3 > 0 are introduced for clarity,\nbut their values are not important for the results of this paper. The cavity contains an optical\n\n\fJanuary 4, 2011\n\n1:20\n\nJournal of Modern Optics\n\nfinal\n\n3\n\nisolator which prevents the pumped mode from circulating inside the cavity. This avoids resonant\nenhancement of the pumped mode in the cavity and thus avoids saturating the particle. The\nbackscattered counterpropagating mode, on the other hand, is amplified on every round trip by\nmeans of an optical amplifier with gain \u03b3 \u2265 1. The amplifier also introduces a noise mode \u00caA\nwith an amplitude \u01ebA which depends on \u03b3. The TMM [27] is used to self-consistently solve for\nthe two counterpropagating field amplitudes at every point in the cavity in the presence of the\npump field and the noise modes. Note that in the limit where the amplifier is compensating for\nthe ring cavity losses, the amplifier noise is also comparable to the loss-induced noise and must\ntherefore be taken into account in our model.\nUsing the notation in Fig. 1(a) we can relate the expectation values of the amplitudes of the two\ninput and two scattered field modes interacting with the particle in a one-dimensional scheme,\nA(k) = h\u00c2(k)i, B(k) = hB\u0302(k)i, C(k) = h\u0108(k)i, and D(k) = hD\u0302(k)i, to Bin (k) = hB\u0302in (k)i by\nmeans of the relations\nB = r2 t3 eik0 l2 Bin , C = \u03b1A , and\n\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\nA\nC\n= M\u0302\n,\nB\nD\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b1(k) = t1 t2 t3 \u03b3 exp(ikL) is the factor multiplied to the field amplitude every round trip.\nIn the preceding equations, as well as in the following, we do not write the index k for simplicity\nof presentation. The operators \u00c2(k), etc., denote the annihilation operators of the various field\nmodes. The three equations Eqs. (1) have a readily apparent physical significance-respectively,\nthey correspond to: the propagation of B\u0302in to reach the particle; the feeding back of \u00c2 to \u0108\nthrough the ring cavity; and the usual transfer matrix relation for a particle interacting with the\nfour fields surrounding it. The first two of these relations are substituted into the third, which\nsubsequently simplifies to\n\n\u0012\n\nA\nBin\n\n\u0013\n\n=\n\n\u0015\n\u0014 \u0015!\u22121 \u0012 \u0013\n\u0014\n1\n0\n\u03b10\n0\n\u2212 M\u0302\nM\u0302\n00\nD\n0 r2 t3 eik0 l2\n\n(2)\n\nIf we assume far off-resonant operation, i.e., \u2202\u03b6/\u2202k = 0, the velocity-dependent transfer matrix\nM\u0302 can be written as [27, 28]\n\n\u0015\n1 + i\u03b6\ni\u03b6 \u2212 2i\u03b6 vc + 2ik0 \u03b6 vc \u2202k\n.\n1 \u2212 i\u03b6\n\u2212i\u03b6 \u2212 2i\u03b6 vc + 2ik0 \u03b6 vc \u2202k\n\n\u0014\n\n(3)\n\n\u2202\nThe notation \u2202k \u2261 \u2202k\nis used throughout; note that this partial derivative acts not only on \u03b1(k)\nbut also on the field mode amplitudes it precedes.

Section 3, we shall make several approximations to obtain a transparent set of equations to briefly explore the equilibrium behaviour of the\nparticle and to compare with a standard master equation approach. In particular, \u03b6 is assumed\nto be real, which is tantamount to assuming that the particle suffers no optical absorption, i.e.,\nif it is an atom, that it is pumped far off-resonance. Moreover, the cavity is assumed to be very\ngood (|t1,2,3 | \u2192 1) and thus no gain medium is introduced in the cavity (\u03b3 = 1). With these\nsimplifications, Eq. (5) reduces to\nF \u2248\n\n\u22128~k02 vc\n\n\u03b62\nRe\n|1 \u2212 \u03b1|4\n\u03ba\u2206C\n\n\u2248 16~k02 \u03b6 2 v\n\n\u22062C\n\n\u001a\n\n\u00012\n+ \u03ba2\n\n\u0001\n\u2217 2 \u2202\u03b1\n\n1\u2212\u03b1\n\n\u2202k\n\n1\n2\nr2 B0 .\n\u03c4\n\n\u001b\n\nr2 B0\n\n2\n\n(9)\n\nIn the preceding equations, \u2206C is the detuning of the pump from cavity resonance, \u03ba is the\nHWHM cavity linewidth,\n\u03ba=\n\n1 1 \u2212 |t1 t2 t3 |\u03b3\np\n,\n\u03c4\n|t1 t2 t3 |\u03b3\n\n(10)\n\nand \u03c4 = L/c is the round-trip time. Using the same approximations as for Eq. (9), we also obtain\nthe diffusion constant\nD \u2248 8~2 k02 \u03b6 2\n\n1\n\u03ba\n2\nr2 B 0 .\n\u22062C + \u03ba2 \u03c4\n\n(11)\n\nNote that \u03b3 = 1 here and therefore \u00caA does not contribute to the diffusion constant. Eqs. (9)\nand (11) hold for the case where \u2206C /\u03ba is not too large. The cavity can be fully described by\nmeans of \u03ba and the finesse F = \u03c0c/(2L\u03ba). Let us now set \u2206C = \u2212\u03ba in Eqs. (9) and (11), whereby\nF = \u2212 \u03c08 ~k02 \u03b6 2 v\n\nF\n2\n2\nr2 B0 , and D = \u03c08 ~2 k02 \u03b6 2 F r2 B0 .\n\u03ba\n\n(12)\n\nThese two expressions have a readily-apparent physical significance; at a constant finesse, decreasing the cavity linewidth by making the cavity longer is equivalent to increasing the retardation effects that underlie this cooling mechanism [30], leading to a stronger friction force. At\nthe same time, this has no effect on the intracavity field strength and therefore does not affect\nthe diffusion. On the other hand, improving the cavity finesse by reducing losses at the couplers\nincreases the intracavity intensity, thereby increasing both the friction force and the momentum\ndiffusion.\nUsing Eq. (8) together with Eqs. (9) and (11) we obtain, for \u2206C < 0,\nTA \u2248\n\n~\nkB\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n|\u2206C |\n\u03ba\n~\n\u03ba\n+\n\u2265\n\u03ba,\n\u03ba\n|\u2206C | 2\nkB\n\n(13)\n\nwith the minimum temperature occurring at \u2206C = \u2212\u03ba. One notes that this expression is identical\nto the corresponding one for standard cavity\u2013mediated cooling [12], and can be interpreted in a\nsimilar light as the Doppler temperature, albeit with the energy dissipation process shifted from\nthe decay of the atomic excited state to the decay of the cavity field.\n\n\f1:20\n\nJournal of Modern Optics\n\nfinal\n\n6\n\n250\n\nVelocity cooling rate \u2212F /m (s\u22121 )\n\nJanuary 4, 2011\n\n\u03b3 = 1.75\n\u03b3 = 1.00\n\n200\n150\n100\n50\n\n\u21d1 cooling\n\n0\n-50\n\n\u21d3 heating\n\n\u00d70.1\n\n-100\n-150\n-200\n-250\n0.00\n\n0.25\n\n0.50\n\n0.75\n\n1.00\n\nCavity length detuning \u03b4L (units of wavelength)\n\nFigure 2.

(|t1 |2 = |t3 |2 = 0.5, |t2 |2 = 0.99, B0 is chosen such as to give an atomic\nsaturation s = 0.1.)\n\nA particular feature to note in all the preceding expressions is that they are not spatial averages\nover the position of the particle, but they do not depend on this position either. As a result of\nthis, the force, momentum diffusion and equilibrium temperature do not in any way depend on\nthe position of the particle along the cavity field in a 1D model. The issue of sub-wavelength\nmodulation of the friction force is a major limitation of cooling methods based on intracavity\nstanding fields, in particular mirror\u2013mediated cooling [28] and cavity\u2013mediated cooling [13].\n\n2.2.\n\nComparison with a semiclassical model\n\nIn the good-cavity limit and without gain our TMM model is equivalent to a standard master\nequation approach with the Hamiltonian\n\u0124 = \u2212 ~\u2206a \u03c3\u0302 + \u03c3\u0302 \u2212 \u2212 ~\u2206C \u00e2\u2020C \u00e2C\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\n+ ~g \u00e2\u2020C \u03c3\u0302 \u2212 eik0 x + \u03c3\u0302 + \u00e2C e\u2212ik0 x + ~g a\u2217P \u03c3\u0302 \u2212 e\u2212ik0 x + \u03c3\u0302 + aP eik0 x ,\n\n(14)\n\nand the Liouvillian terms\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\nL\u03c1\u0302 = \u2212\u0393 \u03c3\u0302 + \u03c3\u0302 \u2212 \u03c1\u0302 \u2212 2\u03c3\u0302 \u2212 \u03c1\u0302\u03c3\u0302 + + \u03c1\u0302\u03c3\u0302 + \u03c3\u0302 \u2212 \u2212 \u03ba \u00e2\u2020C \u00e2C \u03c1\u0302 \u2212 2\u00e2C \u03c1\u0302\u00e2\u2020C + \u03c1\u0302\u00e2\u2020C \u00e2C ,\n\n(15)\n\nas adapted from Ref.

The pump field is assumed to be unperturbed\nby its interaction with the atom, and in the above is replaced by a c-number, aP . Calculating the\nfriction force form this model leads again to Eq. (9), thus confirming our TMM results by a more\nstandard technique. The advantage of the TMM approach lies in the simplicity and generality\nof expressions such as Eq. (4), and the ease with which more optical elements can be introduced\ninto the system. As shown above, Eq. (7), the momentum diffusion coefficient is easily calculated\nfrom the TMM.\n\n\f1:20\n\nJournal of Modern Optics\n\nfinal\n\n7\n\n-1\n\n10\n\nEquilibrium temperature (K)\n\nJanuary 4, 2011\n\n\u03b3 = 1.75\n\u03b3 = 1.00\nDoppler temperature, TD\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-5\n\n10\n\n0.00\n\n0.10\n\n0.20\n\n0.30\n\n0.40\n\nCavity length detuning \u03b4L (units of wavelength)\n\nFigure 3.

The horizontal axis differs from that in Fig. 2 mainly because the temperature\nis only well-defined for regions where the friction force promotes cooling. (Parameters are as in Fig. 2.)\n\n3.\n\nNumerical results and discussion\n\nWe can use the conversion factor |B0 |2 = P/(~k0 c), where P is the power of the input beam, to\nevaluate the above equations [notably Eqs. (5) and (7)] numerically in a physically meaningful\nway. Specifically, the particle is now assumed to be a (two\u2013level) 85 Rb atom, pumped \u221210\u0393 from\nD2 resonance, where \u0393 = 2\u03c0 \u00d7 3.03 MHz is the HWHM linewidth of this same transition at a\nwavelength of ca. 780 nm; because the detuning is much larger than the linewidth, we simplify\nthe calculations by setting \u2202\u03b6/\u2202\u03c9 = 0. The beam waist where the particle interacts with the\nfield is taken to be 10 \u03bcm. With the parameters in Fig. 2, the power is reduced by a factor of\n1/|t1 t2 t3 |2 = 4.04 with each round-trip, in the presence of no gain in the amplifier. We shall\ncompare this case to the low-gain case; the gain of the amplifier we consider is constrained to\nbe small enough that |\u03b1|2 = |t1 t2 t3 \u03b3|2 < 1. Under these conditions, there is no exponential\nbuild-up of intensity inside the cavity and the system is stable. A cavity with a large enough\ngain that |\u03b1|2 > 1 would effectively be a laser cavity. Such a system would have no stable state\nin our model, since we assume that the gain medium is not depleted, and will therefore not be\nconsidered further in this paper.\nFig. 2 shows the friction force acting on the particle, and Fig. 3 the equilibrium temperature,\nas the length of the cavity is tuned on the scale of one wavelength. In each of these two figures\ntwo cases are shown, one representing no gain in the amplifier (\u03b3 = 1) and one representing a\nlow-gain amplifier (\u03b3 = 1.75); note that in both cases the condition |\u03b1|2 < 1 is satisfied.\nIn order to provide a fair comparison between these two cases, we choose the pump amplitude\nBin such that the saturation of the particle is the same in the two cases. This ensures that any\ndifference in cooling performance is not due to a simple increase in intensity. Since the TMM as\npresented here is based on a linear model of the particle, our results presented above are only\nvalid in the limit of saturation parameter much smaller than 1. Thus, as a basis for the numerical\ncomparisons between the two different cases, we choose to set the saturation parameter to 0.1.\nFig. 2 shows that under these conditions the amplified system leads to a significant, approximately 25-fold, enhancement of the maximum friction force. This can therefore be attributed\nunambiguously to the effective enhancement of the cavity Q-factor by the amplifier.\nHowever, for the parameters considered here, in particular for small particle polarisability \u03b6 and\nfor |\u03b1|2 < 1, the counterpropagating mode intensity is much smaller than that of the pumped\nmode, even if the former is amplified. Thus, the intracavity field is always dominated by the\npump beam, whereas the friction force is mostly dependent on the Doppler-shifted reflection of\nthe pump from the particle. Specifically, for the parameters used above we find that the total\nfield intensity changes by less than 1% when the gain is increased from 1 to 1.75. Hence, similar\nresults to those of Fig. 2 are obtained even without pump normalisation.\n\n\fJanuary 4, 2011\n\n1:20\n\nJournal of Modern Optics\n\nfinal\n\n8\n\nREFERENCES\n\nThe steady-state temperature, obtained by the ratio of diffusion and friction, Eq. (8), is shown\nin Fig. 3 for the same parameters as above. We observe that the broader resonance in the friction\nas a function of cavity detuning (i.e., of cavity length), shown in Fig. 2, also leads to a wider\nrange of lower temperatures compared to the amplified case. However, as expected, within the\nnarrower resonance of the amplified system where the friction is significantly enhanced, the\nstationary temperature is also significantly reduced. We see that while the maximum friction\nforce is increased by a factor of 25.4, the lowest achievable temperature is decreased by a factor\nof 19.9 when switching from \u03b3 = 1 to \u03b3 = 1.75. While the overall cavity intensity is dominated\nby the pump field, and is therefore hardly affected by the amplifier, the diffusion is actually\ndominated by the interaction of the weak counterpropagating field with the pump field. This\ncan be seen most clearly by the strong detuning dependence of the analytic expression for D in\nthe good-cavity limit, Eq. (11). As a consequence, the lowest achievable temperature is improved\nby a slightly smaller factor than the maximum friction coefficient. This is consistent with the\nidea that the amplifier not only increases the cavity lifetime, but also adds a small amount of\nadditional noise into the system. Nevertheless, a strong enhancement of the cooling efficiency is\nobserved in the presence of the amplifier.\n4.\n\nConclusions and Outlook\n\nWe have presented a modified model for optomechanics inside ring cavities where only one of\nthe counter-propagating fields in the cavity is allowed to circulate. By pumping the other mode\nand using a gain medium inside the cavity, one can greatly improve the optomechanical force\nacting on a polarisable particle inside the cavity, regardless of its energy level structure, without\nbringing about ill effects such as saturation or mirror burning. The conceptual introduction of a\ngain medium inside the cavity brings about several interesting possibilities. We have considered\nusing this gain medium to offset losses inherent in the cavity, thereby improving its Q-factor\nsignificantly. This renders possible the use of optical fibres to build the cavity. One could also\nenvisage using doped fibre amplifiers [31] to provide a distributed gain medium along the cavity.\nIn this paper, we only considered low-gain media, such that the total losses in the cavity still\nexceeded the gain. Higher gains could be used to explore and exploit novel phenomena such as\noptomechanical interactions of weakly reflective micromirrors inside laser cavities and will be\nthe subject of future work.\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by the UK EPSRC (EP/E039839/1 and EP/E058949/1), and by the\nCavity\u2013Mediated Molecular Cooling collaboration within the EuroQUAM programme of the\nESF.\nReferences\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n\nS.

We compare the efficiencies of two optical cooling schemes, where a single particle is either\ninside or outside an optical cavity, under experimentally-realisable conditions. We evaluate the cooling\nforces using the general solution of a transfer matrix method for a moving scatterer inside a general\none-dimensional system composed of immobile optical elements. Assuming the same atomic saturation\nparameter, we find that the two cooling schemes provide cooling forces and equilibrium temperatures of\ncomparable magnitude.\n\n1 Introduction\n'Traditional' laser cooling schemes, such as those applied\nto the alkali atoms [1,2] require a closed set of two [3] or\nmore [4] energy levels within which the atom cycles. These\nschemes rely on the spontaneous atomic decay from the\nexcited to the ground state to carry atomic translational\nenergy away from the system. The requirement for a closed\nset of levels means that laser cooling has only been shown\nto be feasible for a small range of atomic species and for\neven fewer molecules [5,6].\nCavity cooling [7] switches the energy decay process\nfrom atomic spontaneous emission to the decay of a cavity field. Specifically, the motion of an atom is coupled\nto a cavity field, itself driven either directly or through\nscattering from the atom [8], and the decay of this field\nleads to damping of the atomic motion by a Sisyphus\u2013\nlike [9] mechanism. This mechanism inherently relies solely\non the dipole force and should therefore be applicable to\nany scatterer that is subject to the dipole force [10]. This\nis the basis for recent investigations of cavity cooling of\nmicromirrors [11] and dielectric spheres [12].\nIn a recent paper [13] we used a scattering theory [14]\nto examine the interaction between a particle and a 'generalised interferometer', and proposed an alternative to\ncavity cooling whereby the particle to be cooled is not inside the cavity, but outside it. By physically separating\nthe atom from the cavity, one can use cavities that are\nof much higher optical quality, or even solid-state, rather\nthan macroscopic, cavities, thereby rendering the apparatus simpler and more amenable to miniaturisation.

A scatterer, characterised by its polarisability \u03b6\nand velocity v, interacting with the four field modes that\nsurround it.\never, by placing the atom outside the cavity, the atom\u2013\ncavity coupling is reduced significantly. The important\nquestion is whether, in practical implementations, these\ntwo effects compensate for one another in such a way as\nto render the cooling forces experienced by an atom outside a cavity similar to those it experiences inside.\nTo answer this question we will first describe the two\nmodels, in Section 2.2 and Section 2.3, respectively, using realistic parameters for state-of-the-art optical devices.\nTaking into account saturation effects, it is seen that the\ntwo models result in similar cooling forces and equilibrium\ntemperatures. An examination of scaling properties of the\nforce acting on the atom in the two schemes then follows\nin Section 3, after which we conclude in Section 4.\n\n2 Comparison of cavity cooling schemes\n2.1 Generic scattering model\nThe two situations we describe will be discussed within\nthe context of a scattering theory based on the transfer\nmatrix method [14]. This scattering model can substitute\nthe usual cavity QED calculations for these systems. At\neach point in a one-dimensional space, and at each frequency, the electric field is described by two complex amplitudes, representing two waves moving in opposite direc-\n\n\f2\n\nAndr\u00e9 Xuereb et al.: Cavity cooling of atoms\n\ntions, cf.

[14],\nthe full velocity-dependent force can be calculated to first\norder in the scatterer velocity v and the friction force F 1\nthen extracted.\nA more rigorous model can be built that uses quantised\nfields rather than classical electromagnetic fields. In such\na model, the transfer matrices operate on the respective\nannihilation operators, and a force operator can be defined\nin much the same way as the force in Eq. (4). The twotime autocorrelation function of this force operator can\nthen be used to obtain the momentum diffusion D acting\non the scatterer [14]. Finally, the fluctuation\u2013dissipation\ntheorem [15] gives the equilibrium temperature T that the\nmotion of the scatterer will tend to:\nkB T = \u2212\n\nD\n,\nF 1 /v\n\n(5)\n\nwhich is only well-defined for a cooling force (F 1 /v < 0),\nand where kB is the Boltzmann constant.\nFurther details of the calculations leading to the above\nexpressions will not be presented in this paper. In the next\ntwo sections, the model is applied directly to investigate\nthe nature of the cooling forces present in the two different\nconfigurations.\n2.2 Cavity mediated cooling: Atom inside the cavity\nPlacing a scatterer-atom [7,16,17], micromirror [18,11],\nor 'point polarisable particle' [10]-inside a cavity has\n\n(a)\nFriction coefficient [units of 10\u22129 N/(W m s\u22121 )]\n\nFor a two-level atom in the low-saturation limit, we can\nwrite\n\u0393\n\u03c3a\n,\n(2)\n\u03b6 =\u2212\n2S \u2206 + i\u0393\nwhere \u03c3a is the on-resonance scattering cross-section of\nthe atom, S the mode area of the beam, \u0393 the HWHM\nlinewidth of the transition, and \u2206 the detuning of the\npump beam from resonance with the transition. In the\ncase of a mirror, \u03b6 is related to its macroscopic properties\nvia its reflectivity r = i\u03b6/(1 \u2212 i\u03b6) and its transmissivity\nt = 1 + r = 1/(1 \u2212 i\u03b6).

(b) Friction coefficient, per unit\ninput power, experienced by the scatterer at different positions in the cavity, for realistic parameters (see text for\ndetails).\nlong been pointed out to be a powerful means of cooling the translational motion of that scatterer. Cooling of\natoms inside resonators has been observed: first [16] as\nan increase in the storage time of atoms inside the cavity, and more directly in Ref. [17]. The layout of such\nan experiment is shown in Fig. 2(a). For our purposes,\nwe place the scatterer inside a symmetrical Fabry\u2013P\u00e9rot\ncavity of length Lc , which we pump from one side; the\ndominant field inside the cavity is a standing wave if the\nreflectivity of the mirrors, r, is sufficiently high. For a numerical example, we use the same cavity properties as\nRef. [19]: finesse F = 56 000 modelled by using mirrors\nwith t = r + 1 = 1/(1 + 133.5i), cavity length 495 \u03bcm,\nand mode waist 30 \u03bcm; we use a wavelength \u03bb = 780 nm.\nIn contrast with Ref. [19], however, our cavity is pumped\nalong its axis.\nWe also take the scatterer to be a two-level atom, with the\ncavity field detuned 10\u0393 to the red of the atomic transition frequency. Thus, the polarisability of the atom is\n\u03b6 = 4.1 \u00d7 10\u22125 + 4.1 \u00d7 10\u22126 i. The maximum friction coefficient is found at a detuning of \u22122.6 \u03ba from the cavity\nresonance. As expected [10], the optimal friction coefficient occurs for a negative detuning, of the pump from the\nbare cavity resonance, but for a positive detuning from the\ndressed atom\u2013cavity resonance.\n\n\fAndr\u00e9 Xuereb et al.: Cavity cooling of atoms\n\n(a)\nFriction coefficient [units of 10\u221211 N/(W m s\u22121 )]\n\nThe dependence of the friction force on the position\nof the scatterer, scanned over a wavelength, is shown in\nFig. 2(b). The presence of the cavity manifests itself primarily through a strong enhancement of both the friction coefficient F 1 /v and the intracavity field intensity\nover their bare field values. The scattering model explored\nabove is only valid in the limit of small saturation; e.g.,\nwhen power broadening of the atom is negligible and the\nlinear polarisability \u03b6 in Eq. (2) applies. For the 85 Rb D2\ntransition, assuming that the beam is circularly polarised,\nthe saturation intensity is 1.67 mW cm\u22122 [20]. In order\nto avoid saturation effects, we restrict the power input\ninto the cavity to 2 pW; this equates to an intracavity intensity of 23 mW cm\u22122 and hence a saturation parameter\ns = 0.14; this is because s is inversely proportional to the\nsquare of the detuning, \u221210\u0393 in this case, of the pump\nbeam from resonance. In turn, this input power yields\na maximal friction coefficient of \u22121.5 \u00d7 10\u221220 N/(m s\u22121 ),\nwhich corresponds to a 1/e velocity cooling time of 9 \u03bcs for\nthe same atom; averaging the friction force over a wavelength gives a cooling time of 37 \u03bcs.\nIn the low-saturation regime, the friction force and momentum diffusion both scale linearly with input power; the\nequilibrium temperature is therefore independent of the\npump power. For the parameters used above, the equilibrium temperature predicted for a scatterer at the point of\nmaximum friction is 56 \u03bcK; averaging the friction coefficient, as well as the diffusion coefficient, over a wavelength,\ngives a higher equilibrium temperature of 220 \u03bcK.\n\n3\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n-0.2\n-0.4\n-0.6\n-0.8\n-1.0\n-1.2\n-1.4\n-1.6\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nAtom position, x (units of wavelength)\n\n(b)\n\n2.3 External cavity cooling: Atom outside the cavity\n\nFig. 3. External cavity cooling. (a) Model, similar to\nFig. 2, but with the atom at a distance L \u2212 x outside\nthe cavity. (b) Friction coefficient per unit input power\nexperienced by the scatterer as x is varied, for realistic\nparameters (see text for details). Note the change of scale,\non the vertical axis, from Fig. 2(b).\n\nMore recently [13] it was proposed that even with the\nscatterer outside the cavity, the cavity's resonance can be\nexploited to enhance the optomechanical friction experienced by the scatterer over that in the standard optomechanical cooling setups [21,22,23], which place the scatterer in front of a single mirror. It is the aim of this section to explore this cooling mechanism, using experimental\nparameters similar to those in the previous section, and\ncompare it with the cavity mediated cooling mechanism\ndiscussed there.\nOur mathematical model, Fig. 3, represents the cavity\nas a standard, symmetrical Fabry\u2013P\u00e9rot cavity. However,\nwe emphasise that in principle what is required is simply\nan optical resonance: the cavity in the model can indeed\nbe replaced by whispering gallery mode resonators [24]\nor even solid-state resonators. As a basis for numerical\ncalculations, and to enable direct comparison, we model\nthe same resonator as in the previous section. It is important to emphasise that the achievable quality factors of\nthe resonators used for external cavity cooling can often\nbe made larger than the ones in the previous section (see,\ne.g., Ref. [25]) because no optical or mechanical access\ninside the resonator itself is required.\nThe pump beam frequency is again taken to be detuned by 10\u0393 to the red of the atomic transition. By\nplacing the atom outside the cavity, one is free to use\nhigh-numerical-aperture optics to produce a tighter focus\n\nthan might be possible in a cavity with good optical and\nmechanical access. Having a tight focus strengthens the\natom\u2013field coupling because of the 1/w2 dependence of \u03b6\non the beam waist w; whereas the friction force scales linearly with the input power, it also scales as \u03b6 2 \u223c 1/w4 [13].\nFocussing the beam therefore increases the atom\u2013field coupling more than the local intensity. Thus, it is now assumed that the beam is focussed down to 1 \u03bcm, which\ngives \u03b6 = 3.7 \u00d7 10\u22122 + 3.7 \u00d7 10\u22123 i.\nIn order to make a fair comparison between the two cases,\nwe choose to set the saturation parameter s = 0.14, as\nin the previous section. The maximum achievable friction\nforce coefficient is then -2.9 \u00d7 10\u221221 N/(m s\u22121 ) for 200 pW\nof input power, which compares well with the previous result and leads to a 1/e velocity cooling time of 50 \u03bcs and\nan equilibrium temperature of 280 \u03bcK. The magnitude of\nthe force in this case results from the much smaller pumping beam mode waist, allowing the use of much higher\npowers and subsequently leading to a stronger atom\u2013field\ninteraction. With this beam waist and finesse we would\nbe restricted to input powers several orders of magnitude\nsmaller if the atom were inside such a cavity.\nIn summary, whereas the friction force inside a cavity\nis much stronger per unit input power and for the same\nbeam waist, the restrictions imposed on the magnitude of\nthese quantities when the atom is inside the cavity reduce\n\n\fAndr\u00e9 Xuereb et al.: Cavity cooling of atoms\nFriction coefficient [units of 10\u221210 N/(W m s\u22121 )]\n\n4\n2.0\n\n\u00d7100 ; 100 \u03bcm\n\u00d7103 ; 10 \u03bcm\n\u00d7105 ; 1 \u03bcm\n\n\u00d7105\n1.5\n\u00d7103\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n-0.5\n-1.0\n-1.5\n-2.0\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nAtom position, x (units of wavelength)\n\nFriction coefficient [units of 10\u221211 N/(W m s\u22121 )]\n\nFig. 4.

This is in sharp\ncontrast to the case of large polarisability, achieved by an\n\natom at a tight beam focus or by a micromirror, as shown\nin Fig. 4. A scatterer of larger polarisability would experience extremely narrow peaks, of spatial extent \u226a \u03bb, in\nthe friction force if it lies inside a cavity but not outside\nit.\nWithin the scattering model used in this paper, the atom\u2013\ncavity coupling can be tuned by varying either the beam\nwaist or the laser detuning from atomic resonance. Experimentally, however, atom\u2013cavity coupling is rarely investigated close to resonance, in order to minimise the effects\nof atomic decoherence through spontaneous emission. In\nsuch cases, this coupling can be increased by operating\na cavity with a small mode waist; this may in turn be\ndetrimental to the performance of the system due to the\nstrong sub-wavelength nature of the interaction, as explored in Fig. 4. The net effect of having a smaller mode\nwaist is that this not only demands extremely good localisation but also tends to decrease the effective friction coefficient drastically-by up to several orders of magnitude-\nbecause of spatial averaging effects; this will be investigated in detail elsewhere.\nIn Section 2.3, no mention was made of the average\nfriction force acting on the scatterer; indeed this average\ncomputes to approximately zero for any case involving fardetuned atoms, or other particles with an approximately\nconstant polarisability, outside cavities. This, then, also\ndemands localisation of the atom on a sub-wavelength\nscale; whilst experimentally challenging this disadvantage\nis somewhat mitigated by the easy mechanical and optical\naccess afforded by external cavity cooling schemes. Moreover, Fig. 5 shows that spatial resonances are generally\nmuch wider here than in Fig. 4: the polarisability of the\natom can be varied over a very wide range without affecting the length scale of the cooling and heating regions.\nIn contrast with the atomic situation, if the scatterer is\na micromirror mounted on a cantilever, localisation does\nnot present such a problem, since such micromirrors naturally undergo small oscillations and can be positioned\nwith sub-nm accuracy.\n3.2 Scaling with cavity finesse and linewidth\nCavity\u2013mediated cooling mechanisms depend heavily on\nthe physical properties of the cavity, namely its linewidth\n\u03ba and finesse F . These parameters can be tuned independently by changing the length of the cavity and the reflectivity of its mirrors. This section briefly explores how the\nmechanisms considered scale with \u03ba and F .\nExpressions for the force acting on an atom inside a\ngood cavity are not simple to write down. Nevertheless, in\nthe good-cavity limit one may obtain an analytic formulation for the limiting temperature [7]:\nT =\n\n~\u03ba\n,\nkB\n\n(6)\n\ni.e., making a cavity longer decreases the equilibrium temperature proportionally.

Spatial dependence of the friction force acting on\nan atom outside a cavity, with detuning 10\u0393 to the red of\nresonance. Three different cavity lengths are shown; the\nfriction force scales almost linearly with the cavity length.\nNote the different scaling factors and cavity lengths, given\nabove each curve. (Parameters as in Section 2.3 but with\n\u2202\u03b6/\u2202k = 0.)\nonly on the intensity inside the cavity (\u221d F ), the friction\nforce scales linearly with both the intensity and, if the\nintensity is kept constant, with the lifetime of the cavity\nfield (\u221d 1/\u03ba). The friction force is therefore proportional\nto F /\u03ba, and the equilibrium temperature proportional to\n\u03ba.\nAs is known from Ref. [13], the friction force (F 1 ) acting on an atom outside a cavity scales approximately linearly with both the length and the finesse of the cavity.\nThis is interpreted in terms of a 'distance folding' mechanism: the lifetime of the light inside a\u0001cavity scales inversely with its linewidth \u03ba \u221d 1/ F LC if all other parameters are kept fixed. One can see this behaviour reproduced in Fig. 6, where the friction coefficient for on\nan atom outside each of three cavities having different\nlengths is shown. This mechanism loses its importance if\nthe atomic polarisability is too large, whereby the system\nbehaves more like two coupled cavities, or if the cavity is\ntoo long. The momentum diffusion affecting the atom outside a cavity is essentially independent of the properties of\na good cavity, since it depends on the local intensity surrounding the scatterer; putting these two results together,\nthen, gives [13]\n~\u03ba\nT \u2248 1.9\n,\n(7)\nkB\nin the limiting case of small polarisability and at the point\nof maximum friction; i.e., the temperature scales in the\nsame way as for an atom inside the cavity. The numerical\nfactor in the preceding equation depends on \u03b6 and is larger\nfor \u03b6 \u223c 1.\nThe cavity linewidth also affects the velocity 'capture\nrange' of the cooling mechanisms discussed in this text.\nIn the case of cooling of atoms inside a cavity, it has been\ndiscussed in the literature [27,28] that the mechanism involved applies for atoms with a velocity |v| < \u03ba/k. The\ntheory described in this paper is correct only up to linear\n\nWe have used the solution for the friction force and diffusion constant experienced by a polarisable scatterer interacting with a general 1D optical system to compare\ntwo different 'cavity enhanced' cooling methods, where\nthe scatterer is either inside or outside the cavity. It was\nfound that, with state-of-the-art experimental parameters,\nthe constraints imposed by the saturation of atomic transitions imply that the two mechanisms produce friction\nforces and lead to equilibrium temperatures that are of\ncomparable magnitudes. The velocity capture range of\nboth mechanisms scales linearly with the cavity linewidth,\nand is therefore expected to be similar in the two cases.\nIt was also shown that for weakly polarisable scatterers (e.g., atoms in the low-saturation regime), positioning\nrequirements are stronger for external cavity cooling due\nto a net-zero spatially averaged friction force. This conclusion is reversed for strongly polarisable scatterers (e.g.,\nmicromirrors), in which case the friction force inside a\ncavity varies over a much shorter length-scale than that\noutside.\nThis work was supported by the UK Engineering and Physical\nSciences\nResearch\nCouncil\n(EPSRC)\ngrants\nEP/E058949/1 and EP/E039839/1, and the European Science\nFoundation's EuroQUAM project Cavity-Mediated Molecular\nCooling, and by the National Office for Research and Technology (ERC HU 09 OPTOMECH) of Hungary.\n\nReferences\n1.

Cooling\nrates depending on particle position and coupling parameters are obtained by an analytical perturbative approach.\nFinally, we present a semiclassical computational model incorporating momentum diffusion, which will eventually allow us\nto predict steady-state temperatures.\n\nOur model\n\nPrinciples of the mechanism\nJust as two separate particles in a light field\nmay be optically bound [1], so can an atom\nbe optically bound to its reflection in a mirror.\nA time delay is introduced by this mechanism,\nwhich results in a friction force which opposes\nthe motion of the particle.\n\nPump beam\n\nF\nPump beam\n\nMirror\n\nAtom\n\nWe model the system as shown above: an atom, some distance away from\na mirror, is illuminated by an off-resonant light beam.\n\nv\nMirror\n\nIn effect, the atom can be seen as being optically bound to itself at an\nearlier time.\n\nThe light beam is modelled as a continuous Gaussian beam and assumed\nto be single-mode.\nLongitudinal motion of the atom is treated classically.\n\nEquations of motion\nCooling\n\nThrough a semiclassical approach [2], we get a set of coupled stochastic differential\nequations for the atomic position and momentum, as well as the field amplitude.\n\nHeating\n\nMomentum diffusion is included through noise terms in the equations.\n\nPerturbative approach: An analytical solution\nUsing a perturbative approach, these equations of motion are solvable analytically.\nAssuming that the pump detuning \u0394 is much greater than the line width, and working to first\norder in the coupling strength g and atomic velocity v, we get the friction force:\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\nAtomic position\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n(in units of )\n\nField intensity\nFriction force\n\nThis force increases with both field intensity I and time delay .\nThis suggests a cooling time of the order of 10 to 100 ms for a delay time of 13 ns (ca. 4 m).\n\nNumerical simulations\nThe coupled differential equations of motion were solved numerically and non-perturbatively for\ndifferent atomic starting positions, momenta, etc.\nA harmonic trap was added to localise the atom better in regions that promote cooling.\nTo permit a thorough examination of the parameter space, a large number of simulations were conducted\nwithout taking into account the diffusion.\nIn the limits where the analytical solution applies, the simulations show the expected dependence on a\nnumber of parameters, inlcuding \u0394 (see the graph above right) and on .\n\n20\n\n18\n\n16\n\n14\n\n12\n\nMomentum diffusion counteracts the cooling effect, leading to finite steady-state temperatures.\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\nThe graph on the right shows the momentum distribution for a number of particles that have interacted with\nthe system.

This technique, therefore, cannot be extended\nto species-such as molecules-which, in general, do not have closed optical transitions.\nAnother way of introducing a viscous component to the force acting on an atom is to use the optical dipole force. Under the right conditions, this force\ncauses one atom to be attracted to another similar atom or, by the use of a mirror, to its own reflection. The delay introduced by the light travelling from\nthe atom to the mirror and back gives the required viscous component, always acting to slow the atom down. This effect can be augmented greatly by\nthe use of a resonant cavity instead of a simple mirror. Having an array of these microscopic mirrors or cavities, with each imaging the atom onto itself,\nfurther increases the strength of this interaction. Better coupling of the atom to its reflection, and thus more efficient cooling, can be achieved by the\nuse of evanescent waves or a dipole trap to confine the atom close to the surface.\n\nBasic principles of the mechanism\n\nOur model\n\nJust as two separate particles in a light field may be optically bound [1], so can an atom be\noptically bound to its reflection in a mirror.\n\nKey components of the model:\nan off-resonant pump beam, interacting with\nan atom in front of\na single mirror.\n\nA time delay is introduced by this mechanism, resulting in a friction force which opposes the motion\nof the particle.\n\nThe force experienced by the atom is positive (heating) or negative (cooling) depending on the\ndistance of the atom from the mirror (see Fig. 3).\n\nIn effect, the atom can be seen as being optically bound to itself at an earlier time.\n\nWe therefore need to introduce a harmonic trap to localise the atom inside the cooling region.\nThis improves the cooling mechanism dramatically.\nTheoretically, our model is very similar to cavity-cooling mechanisms [2].\n\nv\n\nHarmonic trap\n\nF\nv\n\nPump beam\nMirror\n\nMirror\n\nFig. 1\n\nDisturbance in the electric field\ndue to a refractive particle.

Our group is conducting research into different ways of overcoming this hurdle.\nOne avenue of research we are exploring is the dipole force. This is a force induced on matter by light and which can be used to manipulate anything\nfrom single atoms to living cells. Our theoretical investigations lead us to believe that this force can be used to cool down atoms by making them\ninteract with their reflection in a mirror. With these investigations at a mature stage, we are now preparing to investigate this phenomenon\nexperimentally.\n\nApplications of cold atoms\n\nAnother application of cold-atom research that is likely to become more and more important in\nthe coming years is Quantum Information. Quantum systems, such as cold atoms, are able to\nperform multiple calculations simultaneously, unlocking massive parallel processing\ncapabilities. Cold atoms are, in fact, behind most research into quantum computing.\n\nWhy is there so much research into cooling atoms and molecules? In other words, what\nadvantage do precise measurements of atomic properties offer us?\nIn fact, we have almost all come into direct contact with one of the most important products of\ncold-atom research: the Global Positioning System (GPS). This system requires a number of\nsatellites to emit a signal at precise time-intervals. The only way we know to achieve this sort of\nprecision and long-term stability is through atomic clocks, which are themselves based on making\nvery accurate measurements on cold atoms.\n\nCold chemistry is an avenue that is starting to be explored. This will likely revolutionise our\nunderstanding of chemical processes occuring between atoms.\nCold molecules are also used in experiments exploring the same fundamental physics as the\nLarge Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, at a fraction of the cost.\n\nThe problem: Fast-moving atoms\n\nTemperature and speed\n\nPerforming measurements on a system is like taking photographs. If your subject is moving, the\nphotograph will be blurry. One way of overcoming this problem is to stop the subject from moving\nduring the exposure.\n\nWhat is the connection between the speed of an atom and its temperature? In fact, these two\nconcepts are directly related. Hot atoms have more energy and therefore move faster than cold\natoms. Our answer, then, is to rob the atoms from their energy. In other words, we need to cool our\natomic samples if we want to make sensible measurements.\nFig. 3: With hot (fast) atoms, one cannot observe the\nfine features of an atom's spectrum [red curve]. With\ncolder (slower) atoms, a number of features become\napparent in the spectrum [blue curve].\n\nSignal\n\nWe experience the exact same problems at the atomic scale. Atoms, in their normal state, are\nmoving at very high speeds-hundreds of metres per second. But how can we slow atoms down?\nTo answer this question, we need to explain the fundamental concepts behind temperature.\n\nHow cold do our atoms have to be? In order to make the measurements we require, we cool our\nsamples of atoms to about 100 \u03bcK-i.e., 100 millionths of a degree above absolute zero!\n100 \u03bcK\n\n100 nK\n\nFig. 1: If an atom is moving fast, all one\nsees when measuring its properties is a\nblur...\n\nFig. 2: ... stop the atom from moving,\nhowever, and its properties are now\neasier to measure.\n\n300 K\n\n4K\n\nx1000\nCold\natoms\n\n6000 K\n\nx1000\n\nx1000\n\nBose-Einstein\ncondensates\n\nLiquid helium\n\n15 000 000 K\n\nx1000\n\nRoom\ntemperature\n\nEarth's core\n\nWe cool atoms through\nthis range of temperatures\n\nSun's core\n\nAdapted from original figure by Sunil Patel.\n\nDoppler cooling of atoms\n\nThe problem with Doppler cooling\n\nAll of us are familiar with the Doppler effect: this is the reason why the sound coming from an\nobject-the horn of a car, say-changes in pitch (frequency) if the object is moving towards or\naway from us.\n\nDoppler cooling is a very effective means of laser cooling atoms-in a fraction of a second we can\ncool atoms down from room temperature to a few hundred microkelvin. In fact, this force is about\n1000 times as strong as gravity!\n\nAtoms only interact with light if it has a particular resonant frequency. If we shine light on a static\natom that is not exactly resonant, the atom will be transparent to the light. If the atom is\nmoving, however, it will interact with the light, which will seem to the atom to have a different\nfrequency than it really does.\n\nHowever, it is not applicable to all elements! This is because every time an atom absorbs a photon,\nit needs to be \"reset\" to be able to absorb another photon. Not all atoms can be reset in this way,\nand the cooling process therefore halts after just one interaction. Compared with the 10,000 or\nso interactions that are needed to obtain a cold sample, this is definitely not enough.\nThe problem is even more severe in the case of molecules: none can be cooled this way!\n\nMoving atoms will then absorb photons from the light, and in doing so will slow down.\n\n1\nH\n\nLight beam\n\nLight beam\n\nFig. 4: In Doppler cooling, a static atom does not\ninteract with the light; but a moving one does.\n\nFig. 5: Our group's magneto optical trap, based on these\nprinciples.

As a result\nof this interaction a force is set up between them, like an optical spring.\n\nThe dipole force is interesting to us because it can be used to manipulate anything from atoms\nto small polystyrene beads and even living cells simply using laser beams.\n\nLight\nbeam\n\nIn particular, the dipole force can act on an atom regardless of whether a \"resetting\" mechanism is\nin place or not. This increases the range of applicability of manipulation of matter by laser\nbeams enormously.\n\nFig. 8: Attractive forces between two particles.\n\nWhat we can now do is to put a mirror in between the two particles. The mirror will reflect the\nlight and the remaining particle interacts with its own reflection. However, light travels at a finite\nspeed, and the delay it takes for the reflected light to reach the particle is enough for it to move a\nshort distance.\nIn other words, the particle will feel a force trying to move it towards its earlier position. This slows\nit down. Replacing the particle by an atom, we can thus use the dipole force to cool the atom.\n\nThe dipole force, as the van der Waals force, is\nalso exploited in nature. In fact, some lizards can\nclimb on vertical surfaces using the attractive\ndipole force between its feet and the surface.\n\nFig. 7: The dipole force, in the form of \"optical tweezers\",\nbeing used to trap a single-celled organism in place.\nSimilar mechanisms apply for the interaction between a\nlaser beam and an atom.\n\nLight\nbeam\n\nOriginal figure from the Institute of Scientific Instruments, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.\n\nMirror\n\nFig. 9: A particle attracted to its position at an earlier time.\n\nOutlook and future research\nHere in Southampton we are conducting an investigation into the theory of mirror-mediated cooling, and we are\nalso gearing up to explore this effect experimentally.\nWe are also looking at ways of increasing the strength of the interaction by using mirrors with speciallydesigned surfaces.\nSeveral other methods have been proposed for the cooling atoms, most of which are applicable to more\ngenerally than Doppler cooling.\n\nQuantum Control Group\nSchool of Physics and Astronomy\nUniversity of Southampton\nSouthampton SO17 1BJ\nUnited Kingdom\n\nCavity-Mediated Molecular Cooling\n\nFig. 10: Four steps to the formation of a nano-templated surface.\nThe end result is a gold mirror with a number of hemispheres.\nThese hemispheres act like lenses, increasing the strength of the\ninteraction between the atoms and the light.\nThis method was pioneered by P N Bartlett (School of Chemistry) in\nthe University of Southampton.\n\nOptoelectronics Research Centre\nUniversity of Southampton\nSouthampton SO17 1BJ\nUnited Kingdom\n\nFigure B.3: An explanation of laser cooling intended for a lay audience.\n\n\f256\n\nAppendices: Publications & Talks\n\nScattering theory of cooling in optomechanical systems\nAndr\u00e9 Xuereb*, Hamid Ohadi, James Bateman, Richard Murray,\nMatthew Himsworth, Tim Freegarde1,\nPeter Domokos2, Peter Horak3\n*E-mail address: andre.xuereb@soton.ac.uk\nSchool of Physics and Astronomy, University of Southampton 2Hungarian Academy of Sciences 3Optoelectronics Research Centre, University of Southampton\n\n1\n\nWe present a one-dimensional scattering theory describing from the optomechanical coupling of the motion of scatterers to the electromagnetic field. Multiple scattering to all\norders is taken into account. The result is a versatile model that can be used to describe a wealth of effects, including optical molasses and novel interactions between atoms\nand cavities. This could potentially lead to optical cooling mechanisms applicable to a wide range of atomic and molecular species.\nOur model is a generalisation of the transfer matrix approach in optics. The Lorentz boost and the Doppler shift are included in this generalised transfer matrix, and the\napproach can in principle be extended to describe two- or three-dimensional systems, as well as complex cascaded optical systems. In the simplest case of pumping at one\nfrequency, the force and momentum diffusion acting on any component of the optical system can be calculated analytically.\n\nMotivation\n\nIntroduction to matrix methods in 1D\n\nLight forces are now used to manipulate the motion of everything from atoms to\nresonators.\n\nThe transfer matrix method is used in optics when\ndealing with multi-element or multi-layer systems\n(see Fig. 1).\n\nSeveral frameworks exist to describe these interactions between light and matter; but\nnone addresses the full range of interactions: some are useful in discussing weak\ninteractions, whereas others describe scatterers that act as boundary conditions on the\nelectromagnetic field.\nOur aim is a single theoretical framework that explains the optomechanical\ninteractions between light and scatterers at all strengths of these interactions:\n\nEach scatterer interacts withfour light modes : two to the\nleft and two to the right, as shown in Fig. 2. The transfer\nmatrix represents the mixing among these four modes.\n\nto\n\nFrom\n\nThe transfer matrix for the entire system is the product of\nthe individual transfer matrices. Stacked systems, such\nas dielectric mirrors, are particularly simple to handle,\nrequiring one to simply raise a 2-by-2 matrix to some\ninteger power.\n\nComplicated systems, made up of a number of optical\nelements, and their interactions with the light field can\ntherefore be explored as easily as a single mirror.\n\nCurrent theoretical frameworks cannot deal with the vast range of interaction strengths one is concerned with in\nexperiments. These can range from a perturbative interaction with the field, as is the case with an atom interacting\nwith its reflection in a mirror, to a moving boundary condition, as is the case in a Fabry-Perot cavity with one of its\nmirrors on a cantilever.\n\nExtension to moving scatterers\n\nFig. 1: Multilayer dielectric mirrors are\neasily analysed by means of the transfer\nmatrix method.\n\n?\nFig. 2: The transfer matrix representing\nany particular element is calculated by\nworking out the interaction among the\nfour\nfield\nmodes\nsurrounding\nthe\nelement.\n\nFor example, suppose we characterise an atom by its polarizability, . The transfer matrix for\nsuch an atom, assuming that it is not moving, is quite simple:\n\nThe transfer matrix of a static scatterer is easily extended to account for the motion of\nthe scatterer. To perform this transformation we need to account for the Lorentz boost\nand the Doppler shift of the electromagnetic field.\nFor example (see figure to the right), field\ninteracts\nwith a red-shifted field\nand an unshifted field .\nThe amplitude of field\n, as seen by field\n, is also\nmodified; this is the Lorentz boost.\n\nBy applying the aforementioned transformation, we obtain the matrix for a moving atom,\ncorrect to first order in its velocity:\n\nThe resulting transformation has a wide applicability and takes the form of a linear\nmatrix transformation acting on the original transfer matrix:\nHere, we have made the simplification that the polarizability is independent of frequency.\n\nwhere\n\nThe variation of\nwith frequency, in fact, is what allows us to apply this method to explain\nsuch effects as Doppler cooling in 1D optical molasses [1].\n\n.\n\nApplication: Cavity assisted cooling\nWe recently [2] proposed a novel cooling mechanism (mirror mediated cooling) that\ninvolves a particle interacting with its own time-delayed reflection in a distant mirror:\n0.2\nSteady-state temperature\n\nHeating\n\nCooling\n\nNumerical simulations\nAnalytic formula\n\n0\n\nField intensity\nFriction force\n\nThe new friction force depends crucially on the properties of the cavity, since the cooling\nmechanism arises from the decay of the cavity field, and allows us to bring our atomic\nsample closer to the surface.\nPlotting the friction force experienced by the atom, we can see that it follows the amplitude\nof the intracavity field.\n\n-0.2\n\n~3 m\n\n-0.4\nHeating rate\n\n-0.6\n\n103\n\n-0.8\n-1\n-1.2\n\n102\n\n-1.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\nAtomic position\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\n(in units of )\n\n~30 \u03bcm\n\n-1.6\n\n101\n\n-1.8\n\n~1 mm\n\n-2\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\nInitial temperature (mK)\n\nUsing the transfer matrix method, we modelled this situation and obtained the same\nresults as those obtained by means of a semiclassical theory.

By employing the retarded dipole-dipole interaction\nof any polarisable particle with its own image we can dampen the particle's motion by coupling it to the light field.\nTo analyse this model, we extend the transfer matrix method to be able to handle moving scatterers. This framework proves to be very versatile and allows us to extend the\nmirror-mediated cooling method to include more complex optical components. As a prototypical system, we replace the mirror by a two-mirror cavity, outside which the atom\nsits. This cavity acts to greatly enhance the coupling of the particle motion to the light field. Plasmonic structures could also act as similar amplifiers.\nOur group aims to explore this wide class of atom-surface interactions experimentally, and to this end we have devised a MOT configuration and imaging system that together\nallow us to probe these interactions at an unprecedented level of detail.\ntime delay\n\nMirror-mediated cooling\n\nCooling\n\nSteady-state temperature\n\nField intensity\nFriction force\n\n-0.4\n\nF\nPump beam\n\n(tightly focussed)\n\nv\n\nNumerical simulations\nAnalytic formula\n\n0\n-0.2\n\nAtom\n\n0.5\n\nMirror\n\nThe interaction of the particle with the mirror is due to the retarded dipole force [2] and is therefore\nlargely independent of the particle's internal structure, and applicable to any polarisable particle.\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\nAtomic position\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\nHeating rate\n\nThe time delay introduced by this mechanism results in a viscous\ncomponent in the dipole force, opposing the motion of the particle.\n\nFig. 2: Heating rate for\ndifferent initial\ntemperatures of\n85\npopulations of Rb.

This may mask links between\nthe physics describing related situations: an atom interacting with a light field can, on some level, be described\nsimilarly to a mirror interacting with the same light field. By treating these two objects as extremes of a general\nscatterer, we are able to link the two situations, and any intermediate case, in a natural manner.\n\nExtension to moving scatterers\nThe transfer matrix of a static scatterer is easily extended to account for the motion of the scatterer. We need to account for the Lorentz boost and the Doppler shift of the\nelectromagnetic field. For example (see figure to the right), field\ninteracts with a red-shifted field\nand an unshifted field . The amplitude of field , as seen by field , is also\nmodified; this is the Lorentz boost. The resulting transformation takes the form of a linear matrix transformation acting on the original transfer matrix [4]:\n, where\n\n.\nTwo input and one output modes interacting with\na moving scatterer. In the laboratory frame, these\nthree modes do not all have the same frequency.\n\nWe can now express the fields surrounding the scatterer in terms of the properties of the system and the input fields analytically and obtain the friction force acting on it [5]:\n, where\n\nExternal cavity cooling\n\n, etc.\n\nPlotting the friction force experienced by the atom, we can see that it follows the amplitude of the\nintracavity field [5]:\n~3 m\n\nUsing the transfer matrix method, we modelled the mirror-mediated situation and obtained the same\nresults as those obtained by means of a semiclassical theory.

For a onedimensional example, we find cooling times of milliseconds and limiting temperatures in the millikelvin range. The force, which may be\nconsidered the prototype for cavity\u2013mediated cooling, may also be enhanced by plasmon and cavity resonances at the mirror.\n\nMotivation and introduction\nSeveral recent schemes for cooling particles have relied not on the scattering force of nearly resonant radiation, but on the\noptical dipole force present when the particle experiences spatially-varying interaction with off-resonant illumination.\nWe mention, in particular, cavity\u2013mediated cooling [1] and mirror\u2013mediated cooling [2] mechanisms, where the decay\nchannel is shifted from an atomic resonance to the decay of the field between two reflectors.\nSeveral iterations of such mechanisms exist; the cavity mode can be pumped longitudinally or transversely, for example,\nleading to a markedly different behaviour for the system as a whole. The link between such models, whose differences stem\nfrom geometrical considerations, are often lost in the complexity of the models used to describe them.\n\nFig. 1: Polarized by incident radiation, a\nmoving particle is bound to its reflection\nin a surface, characterized by round-trip\ntime and field propagator.\n\nIn this poster, we discuss a new way of looking at the retarded interaction between a general particle and its image in a\nreflector, based on classical three-dimensional electrodynamics. Our model naturally links mirror\u2013mediated cooling to a\nretarded form of the optical binding [4] model, and where we identify the two particles with a real particle and its reflection.\n\nGeometrical considerations\n\nField\u2013particle interaction\n\nThe mathematical description of our system can be subdivided into two\nmain conceptual ideas: the interaction of the particle with the field and the\ninteraction of the field with the surroundings of the particle.\n\nThe interaction of a polarisable particle with an electric field can be\ndescribed in terms of the effect of the particle on the field itself:\n\nWe describe the latter by means of the round\u2013trip time,\n\nThe particle affects the field through its polarisability, , and we see above\nthat this depends both on its current position and on its position at an\nearlier time.\n\n,\n\n.\n\nand the propagator (related to the Green's function) of the system:\n\n.\n\nWe can formally solve the above equation to obtain:\n\n,\n\nThe nature of the environment of the particle is contained in these two\nexpressions.\n\nto first order in the velocity of the particle, .\n\nThe retarded dipole force\n\nMirror\u2013mediated friction\n\nWe work with the dipole approximation; i.e., we assume that our particle\ncan be represented as a point-like dipole, .\n\nWe apply our model first to the familiar 1D case of an atom interacting with\nits reflection in a plane mirror [2], whereby we have:\n\nAfter painstakingly evaluating the various derivatives that appear in our\nexpressions above, we can then find the Coulomb force acting on the dipole:\n\n.\nThe resulting expressions are almost completely general:\n\u27a4 the force is derived from the vector electric field\n\u27a4 no approximations to a single dimension are necessary a priori\n\u27a4 it relies on the dipole force, and therefore does not assume a particular\n\u27a4 level structure for the particle\nOur only requirement, and the chief limitation of our model, is that the\ndipole approximation holds.\n\n, and\n\n.\n\nHere, is the distance of the atom from the mirror and\nis the laser mode\ncross-sectional area. The force acting on the atom is thus:\n\n.\n\u2780\n\n\u2781\n\n\u2782\n\nThe force therefore comprises three terms:\n\u2780 Dipole force from unperturbed field\n\u2781 Doppler-shifted binding force between the atom and its reflection\n\u2782 Mirror\u2013mediated friction force due to retardation effects (cf. )\nThese results match those obtained from quantum [2] and matrix [3] based\napproaches.\n\nTransverse mirror\u2013mediated cooling\n\nConclusions\n\nGiven the three-dimensional nature\nof our model, we can change the\ngeometry to consider transverse\ncooling mechanisms.\n\nWe have discussed a model, based on retarded classical electromagnetism,\nwhich allows us to describe the interaction between light and any particle\nthat can be described as a point-like dipole.\n\n.\n\nOur formalism is very general and is not restricted to one or two\ndimensions, allowing us to describe situations that cannot be easily\nexamined using other models.\nFig. 2: A particle moving transversely\nto both the mirror and the pumping\nfield should experience a retarding\nforce, even if the pumping field is\ntranslationally invariant.\n\nInterestingly, the friction force in this case is always a damping force, and\ncould therefore prove significant for mesoscopic particles.\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n\nMoreover, we are not limited to including only\nplane mirrors in our geometry; we envisage\nusing resonant surfaces to enhance term \u2782 in\nthe above expression.\nFig. 3: Resonant enhancement of the force acting on the\nparticle is possible through engineering the surface\nproperties.
