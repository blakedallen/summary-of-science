In this paper we look for model\nindepend definition of the habitable zone. It will be shown that the\nradius of the habitable sphere depends only on the constants of the\nNature, \u03b1, h\u0304, c.\nKey words: Habitable sphere; Fine structure constant \u03b1.\n\n\fIntroduction\nThe existence of Extra-Solar planets is well established. In the contemporary\nstatus of the searching program (e. g. DARWIN space infrared interferometer\nproject) the following categories of extra-solar planets are described: Definite\nplanets (20), possible planets (8), microlensed planets (5), borderline planets\n(2), dust clump planets (7) and pulsar planets (4), number in paranthesis\ndenotes the number of planet.1 It is well known that round the Sun the\nhabitable zone \u2013 Ecosphere exists. Within the Sun Ecosphere are: Venus,\nEarth and Mars and Sun. It will be interesting to calculate the Ecosphere\n3/2\nradius for \"average\" star with mass Ms = aG mp (aG = the gravity fine\nstructure constant and mp = proton mass).\nTo that aim in this paper we investigate the possibility of the calculations\nof the planet orbit radii as the function of the fine structure constant \u03b1. We\nargue that the Ecosphere is defined as the part of space rounded the star\nwhich can be calculated assuming the present day value of the electromagnetic fine structure constant. Considering the existence of the ,,niche\" for\nfine structure constant we calculate the niche for planet orbit radii and obtain\nRrel = R(\u03b1)/R(\u03b1 = 1/137) = 0.5 \u2212 1.5 where Rrel denotes the relative orbit\nradii. In the case of the Solar system in Ecosphere we find out the orbits of\nVenus, Earth and Mars. Considering the agreement of the calculation with\nthe Ecosphere radius for Solar system we argue that our model for habitable\nzone can be applied to other planet systems also.\n\nCoincidence\nIn paper [1] the quantum heat transport on the atomic, nuclear and quark\nscale was discussed and the characteristic time scales were obtained. For\natomic scale:\nh\u0304\n\u03c4a =\n,\n(1)\nme \u03b12 c2\nwhere me is electron mass, \u03b1 is the electromagnetic fine structure constant,\nc is the light velocity. For nuclear scale:\n\u03c4n =\n1\n\nh\u0304\n,\nmn (\u03b1s )2 c2\n\nData taken from http://art.star.rl.ac.uk/darwin/planets\n\n2\n\n(2)\n\n\fwhere mn denotes nucleon mass, \u03b1s \u223c 0.15 is the coupling constant for strong\ninteractions. In the case of free quark gas (if it exist!):\n\u03c4q =\n\nh\u0304\nmq (\u03b1sq )2 c2\n\n(3)\n\nand \u03b1sq , mq are the fine structure constant for quark-quark interaction and\nquark mass respectively.\nThe atomic time scale, \u03c4a , is proportional to the ,,atomic year\", Ta , viz.:\n\u03c4a =\n\naB\nh\u0304\n\u223c\n= Ta ,\n2\n2\nme \u03b1 c\n\u03b1c\n\n(4)\n\nwhere aB is the Bohr radius.\nIt is quite interesting to observe that the ,,coincidence\" holds:\nA Ta \u223c TEarth ,\nA mp = 1g,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere A is the Avogardo number, A = 6.02 1023, mp = 1.66 10\u221227 kg is the\nproton mass and TEarth denotes the Earth year (in seconds).\nFrom Kepler law the relation TEarth \u2192 REarth can be concluded:\n2\nTEarth\n=\n\n2mEarth \u03c0\n(\u2212mEarth K)1/2\n\n!2\n\n3\nREarth\n.\n\n(6)\n\nIn formula (6) we approximate Earth orbit as the circle with radius REarth\nand mEarth is the Earth mass, K is equal:\nK = \u2212GmEarth M,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere G is gravity constant and M denotes the mass of the central body\n(the Sun) which creates gravity forces. In the following we approximate the\nM mass of the central body by the mass of the ,,average\" star [2, 3]\n\u22123/2\nM\u223c\n= aG mp = Nmp ,\n\u22123/2\n\n(8)\n\nwhere N = aG is the Landau-Chandrasekhar number, aG denotes the fine\nstructure constant for gravity force. Comparing formulae (5) and (6) one\nobtains:\n!1/2\n!1/2\nAh\u0304c 1\nh\u0304c\nMpl\n3/2\nR =\n.\n(9)\n2\u03c0\u03b12 me c2 mp\nmp c2\n3\n\n\fIn formula (9) for planet radius we omit the subscript ,,Earth\" because the\nradius does not depend on the planet mass. The R denotes the planet orbit\nradius for average star with mass described by formula (8). The planet radius\ndepends only on the three fundamental constant of the Nature: G, h\u0304, c. The\nmass Mpl = ( h\u0304c\n)1/2 is the Planck mass.\nG\nConsidering formula (5), A mp =1 g the planet radius (9) can be formulated in more ,,elegant\" form:\nR\n\n3/2\n\nh\u0304c\n1\n=\n2\nmp \u03b1 me c2\n\nMpl\nmp\n\n!1/2\n\nh\u0304c\nmp c2\n\n!1/2\n\n.\n\n(10)\n\nThe dependence of R on \u03b1 is quite interesting. For, it is well known that\ngrand unified theories allow very sharp limits to be placed on the possible\nvales of the fine structure constant in a cognizable universe. The possibility\nof the doing physics on the background space-time at the unification energy\nand the existence of stars made of protons and neutrons endorse \u03b1 in the\nniche [4]:\n1\n1\n\u2264\u03b1\u2264\n(11)\n180\n85\nor [5]\n1\n1\n\u2264\u03b1\u2264\n.\n(12)\n195\n114\nIt is interesting to observe that one obtains the niche for planet radii - the\nEcosphere which is the consequence of formulae (11) and (12). The Ecosphere\nspans from Rrel \u223c 0.5 to Rrel \u223c 1.5. In the case of the Solar system in\nthis niche we find only the orbits of Venus Earth and on the border of the\nEcosphere: Mars.\nConsidering the agreement of the calculations present in this paper with\nthe habitable zone for Sun, we argue that our model for Ecosphere can be\napplied to other planet systems (other \"worlds\") also.\nThe habitable sphere is conservatively defined as a shell region around a\nstar where liquid water can be found at the surface of the planet. this zone\nis typically from about Rrel 0.95 Au to 1.37 AU. As we shown this \"life shell\"\ncan be calculated as the function of the Nature constants \u03b1, h\u0304, c.\n\n4\n\n\fReferences\n[1] Marciak-Kozlowska J., Kozlowski M.,\nDiscretization of the thermal excitation in highy excited matter,\nFoundation of Physics Letters, 9, (1996), p. 285.\n[2] Landau L.
