One of the most important items on its agenda is the investigation of the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB), in particular the\ndiscovery of one or more Higgs bosons. Once discovered, the measurement of the Higgs\nbosons' properties will be crucial to unravel the underlying EWSB mechanism. The production of a weak gauge boson, W \u00b1 (from now on indicated simply as W unless differently\nspecified) or Z, with a pair of bottom (b) quarks, contributing to both the W/Z + 1 b-jet and\nW/Z + 2 b-jets signatures, represents both an interesting Standard Model (SM) signal and\none of the most important background processes to many Higgs-boson production channels.\nThe cross sections for W and Z boson production with bottom quarks has been measured\n\u221a\nat the Tevatron pp\u0304 collider at Fermilab ( s = 1.96 TeV) by both the CDF [1, 2] and\nD0 [3, 4] collaborations. These measurements will continue with increased precision, which\nwill provide a unique opportunity to test and improve the theoretical description of heavyquark jets at hadron colliders by performing a thorough comparison between the Tevatron\nexperimental data and existing theoretical predictions. Studying the same cross sections\nin the very different kinematic regimes available at the LHC pp collider will then be of\ngreat interest and will represent a crucial test of our understanding of QCD at high-energy\ncolliders.\nMoreover, the production of a W and Z boson with one or two b jets represents a crucial\nirreducible background for several Higgs-boson production channels at the LHC. W bb\u0304 production is an irreducible background to W H associated production followed by the decay\nH \u2192 bb\u0304. This is a difficult channel but theoretically very interesting, since it can play\na very important role in measuring the b-quark Yukawa coupling for a light Higgs boson\nat the LHC. Analogously, for a light Higgs boson, Zbb\u0304 production is a background to ZH\nassociated production followed by the decay H \u2192 bb\u0304. More importantly, for heavier Higgs\nbosons, if the b quarks in Zbb\u0304 production decay leptonically, the Zbb\u0304 production process\ncan be a background to the inclusive production of a Higgs boson followed by the decay\nH \u2192 ZZ with each Z boson decaying leptonically. Finally, Zbb\u0304 production is a background\nto searches for Higgs bosons with enhanced b-quark Yukawa couplings, produced in Hbb\u0304\nassociated production followed by the decay H \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 or H \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 [5].\n2\n\n\fAll Higgs-boson production channels have been calculated including at least next-toleading order (NLO) QCD corrections (see, e. g., Ref. [6] for a recent review). The hadronic\ncross sections for gg \u2192 H and associated W H and ZH production are also known at nextto-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD, Refs. [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]\nand Refs. [18, 19, 20], respectively. The NLO electroweak corrections to these processes\nhave been calculated as well (see Ref. [21] and references therein (gg \u2192 H) and Ref. [22]\n(W H, ZH)). The cross section for Hbb\u0304 associated production is known at NLO in QCD\nincluding full b-quark mass effects [23, 24, 25, 26].\nThe production of a W or a Z boson with up to two jets, one of which is a b jet, has been\ncalculated including NLO QCD corrections in the variable-flavor scheme (VFS) [27, 28, 29],\nwhile the production of a W or Z boson with two b jets has been derived at NLO in QCD\nusing the fixed-flavor scheme (FFS), first in the massless b-quark approximation [30, 31, 32,\n33, 34, 35] and more recently including full b-quark mass effects [36, 37, 38]. In the FFS only\nmassless-quark densities are considered in the initial state, hence the alternative name of 4flavor-number scheme (4FNS), while in a VFS an initial-state b-quark density is introduced,\nhence the alternative name of 5-flavor-number scheme (5FNS). The two schemes amount to\na different ordering of the perturbative series for the production cross section: in the 4FNS\nthe perturbative series is ordered strictly by powers of the strong coupling \u03b1s , whereas in\nthe 5FNS the introduction of a b-quark parton distribution function (PDF) allows to resum\nterms of the form \u03b1sn ln(m2b /M 2 )m at all orders in \u03b1s (for fixed order of logarithms m), where\nM represents the upper integration limit of the b-quark transverse momentum and can be\nthought to be of the order of MW or MZ . While the two approaches can give very different\nresults at the leading or lowest order (LO) in QCD, starting at NLO in QCD they have been\nshown to be consistent within their respective theoretical uncertainties for both H + 1 b-jet\nproduction [39, 40, 41] (for a brief review see also Ref. [26]) and single-top production [42].\nRecently, W + 1 b-jet production has been calculated by consistently combining both NLO\n4FNS and 5FNS calculations [43]. Since the relevance of the logarithms resummed in the\nVFS approach varies with the kinematic regime considered, combining the two calculations\nimproves the accuracy of the theoretical prediction for W + 1 b-jet production. A similar\nstudy is currently in progress for Z + 1 b-jet production [44]. Improving the predictions for\nZ + 1 b-jet production will be particularly relevant at the LHC, where this process allows\nfor a direct determination of the b-quark PDF, to be used in the prediction of H + 1 b-jet\n3\n\n\fproduction, a discovery channel for beyond-the-SM Higgs bosons with enhanced b-quark\nYukawa couplings.\nIn this paper we provide results for W bb\u0304 and Zbb\u0304 production at the LHC, keeping the\nW and Z boson on shell and with both b jets tagged in the final state, i. e. we focus on\nthe W/Z + 2 b-jet case. We include NLO QCD corrections and full b-quark mass effects.\nThe corresponding results for W bb\u0304 and Zbb\u0304 production at the Tevatron have been presented\nin Refs. [36, 37, 38]. The details of the NLO QCD calculations used to compute the NLO\ncross sections in this paper can be found in Refs. [36, 37, 38]. In this paper we focus on\npresenting results for the total production cross sections and kinematic distributions that are\nof interest to LHC physics. Using the MCFM package [45], we compare our results to those\nobtained by neglecting the b-quark mass at NLO in QCD. A non-zero b-quark mass mainly\naffects phase space regions where the relevant kinematic observable, such as the transverse\nmomentum of the bottom quarks or the invariant mass of the b-quark pair, are of the order\nof mb . Indeed, this is the reason why b-quark mass effects cannot be neglected in studies\nof W/Z + n-jet production (n = 1, 2) with at least one b jet, as has been discussed for the\nn = 2 case in Refs. [28, 29] and for the n = 1 case in [43].\nThe paper is organized as follows: in Section II we briefly describe our choice of input\nparameters, cuts, jet-identification algorithm, and observables, while we present numerical\nresults and a discussion of the b-quark mass effects for W bb\u0304 and Zbb\u0304 production in Section III\nand Section IV, respectively. Section V contains our conclusions.\n\nII.\n\nGENERAL SETUP\n\nThe results for both W bb\u0304 and Zbb\u0304 production presented in this paper have been obtained\n\u221a\n\u221a\nfor the LHC pp collider running at a center-of-mass energy of either s = 10 TeV or s =\n14 TeV. While we only provide kinematic distributions obtained with a center-of-mass energy\n\u221a\nof s = 14 TeV, we compare the total cross sections obtained for center-of-mass energies of\n\u221a\n\u221a\ns = 10 TeV and s = 14 TeV in Tables I and II. The mass of the bottom quark is taken to\nbe mb = 4.62 GeV. Results in the massless b-quark approximation have been obtained using\nthe MCFM code (version 5.4) [45]. The top-quark mass, entering in the virtual corrections, is\nset to mt = 172.6 GeV. In the case of W bb\u0304 production we use MW = 80.44 GeV, while for Zbb\u0304\nproduction we use MZ = 91.1876 GeV and derive MW from the relation MW = MZ cos \u03b8W .\n4\n\n\fIn both cases we assume sin2 \u03b8W = 0.223. We work in the electroweak G\u03bc input scheme and\nreplace the fine structure constant \u03b1(0) = e2 /(4\u03c0) by \u03b1(G\u03bc ) =\n\n\u221a\n\n2\n2\nG\u03bc MW\n\u03c0\n\nsin2 \u03b8W with the\n\nFermi constant G\u03bc = 1.16639 * 10\u22125 GeV\u22122 . The W -boson coupling to quarks is proportional\nto the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix elements. We use non-zero CKM matrix\nelements for the first two quark generations, Vud = Vcs = 0.974 and Vus = Vcd = 0.227, while\nwe neglect the contribution of the third generation, since it is suppressed either by the\ninitial-state quark PDFs or by the corresponding CKM matrix elements.\nThe LO results are based on the one-loop evolution of \u03b1s and the CTEQ6L1 set of\nPDFs [46], with \u03b1sLO (MZ ) = 0.130, while the NLO results use the two-loop evolution of \u03b1s\nand the CTEQ6M set of PDFs, with \u03b1sN LO (MZ ) = 0.118. In the calculation of the parton\nluminosity we assume five light flavors in the initial state, but we have verified that including\nthe b-quark PDF has a negligible effect (< 0.1%) on the W/Zbb\u0304 cross section. We implement\nthe kT jet algorithm [47, 48, 49, 50] with a pseudo-cone size of R = 0.7 and we recombine the\nparton momenta within a jet using the so called covariant E-scheme [48]. We checked that\nour implementation of the kT jet algorithm coincides with the one in MCFM. We require all\nevents to have a b-jet pair in the final state, with a transverse momentum larger than either\n15 GeV or 25 GeV, in order to study the dependence on the b-jet transverse-momentum\ncut. We also require that the pseudorapidities of both b jets satisfy |\u03b7 b,b\u0304| < 2.5. We impose\nthe same pT and |\u03b7| cuts also on the extra jet that may arise due to hard non-collinear\nreal emission of a parton, i. e. in the processes W/Zbb\u0304 + g or W/Zbb\u0304 + q(q\u0304). This hard\nnon-collinear extra parton is treated either inclusively or exclusively. In the inclusive case\nwe include both two- and three-jet events, while in the exclusive case we require exactly two\njets in the event. Two-jet events consist of a b-jet pair that may also include a final-state\nlight parton (gluon or quark) due to the applied recombination procedure. On the other\nhand, three-jet events consist of events containing a b-jet pair plus an extra light jet.

In the following we will provide results separately for both production\nprocesses.\nIn Fig. 1 we illustrate the renormalization- and factorization-scale dependence of the\nLO and NLO total cross sections obtained for a massive b quark, when \u03bc = \u03bcr = \u03bcf is\nvaried between \u03bc0 /2 and 2\u03bc0 , with \u03bc0 = MW + 2mb . We immediately notice that the\nimpact of NLO QCD corrections is very large, in particular in the inclusive case, where they\nincrease the LO cross section by a factor between two and three depending on the scale.\nWe also notice that the scale dependence of the NLO cross section is worse than (inclusive\ncase) or comparable to (exclusive case) the scale dependence of the LO cross section. This\nis different from what has been observed for the Tevatron [36, 38], and was first pointed\nout in a calculation with massless bottom quarks [35].

The lower window shows a bin-by-bin K factor, for\nthe inclusive (red, solid) and exclusive (blue, dot-dashed) cases.\n\nthe NLO QCD corrections introduce a new, numerically important production channel not\npresent at LO, as will be discussed in more detail below. Therefore, only at NLO the scale\ndependence of the cross sections starts to be a meaningful measure of the behavior of the\nperturbative expansion.\nIn order to understand better the behavior of the W + bb\u0304 and W \u2212 bb\u0304 cross section, we\nalso show in Fig. 1 the scale dependence of the individual parton-level channels. We notice\nthat although the qg(q\u0304g) \u2192 W \u00b1 bb\u0304 + q \u2032 (q\u0304 \u2032 ) channel appears for the first time at NLO in the\nperturbative expansion of the W bb\u0304 cross section, it is actually a tree level contribution and,\nas such, introduces a large scale dependence in the calculation that will be moderated only\nby adding (still unknown) NNLO corrections. The reason why this becomes so evident at\nthe LHC, while it is not at the Tevatron, is because the qg(q\u0304g) \u2192 W \u00b1 bb\u0304 + q \u2032 (q\u0304 \u2032 ) channel is\nenhanced by the correspondingly large initial-state gluon PDF. The NLO W bb\u0304 total cross\nsection is particularly affected by this process because there is no gluon-initiated process at\nLO. Finally, the impact of the qg(q\u0304g) \u2192 W \u00b1 bb\u0304+q \u2032(q\u0304 \u2032 ) channel on the scale dependence of the\ntotal cross section is larger in the inclusive than in the exclusive case because the exclusive\ncross section by definition discriminates against processes with more than two jets in the\n9\n\n\f-2\n\n-1\n\n18\n\npt > 15 GeV\n\n16\n\n|\u03b7| < 2.5\n\n14\n\nR = 0.7\n\n0\n\n1\n\n-2\n\nECM = 14 TeV\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n+ _\n\n2\n\nLO\nNLO Inc\nNLO Exc\n\nW bb\n\n20\n18\n16\n14\n12\n\n10\n\n10\n\n8\n\n8\n\n6\n\n6\n\n4\n\n4\n\n2\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n3\n\n3\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\nLeading b-Jet \u03b7\n12\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\npt > 15 GeV\n\n10\n\nk-factor\n\nd\u03c3 / d\u03b7 [ pb / \u2206 \u03b7 ]\n\n2\n\n12\n\nk-factor\n\nd\u03c3 / d\u03b7 [ pb / \u2206 \u03b7 ]\n\n20\n\n8\n\n2\n\n-2\n\nb,l\n\n1\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\nSubleading b-Jet \u03b7\n2\n\n-2\n\nECM = 14 TeV\n\n|\u03b7| < 2.5\n\n-1\n\n-\n\n0\n\n1\n\n_\n\n2\n\nLO\nNLO Inc\nNLO Exc\n\nW bb\n\n0\n\nb,sl\n\nR = 0.7\n\n12\n10\n8\n\n6\n\n6\n\n4\n\n4\n\n2\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n3\n\n3\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\nLeading b-Jet \u03b7\n\n2\n\n-2\n\nb,l\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\nSubleading b-Jet \u03b7\n\n2\n\n0\n\nb,sl\n\nFIG. 4: LO (black, dashed), NLO inclusive (red, solid) and NLO exclusive (blue, dot-dashed)\npseudorapidity distributions for the b jet with the leading (left hand side) and subleading (right\nhand side) transverse momentum in W + bb\u0304 (upper plots) and W \u2212 bb\u0304 (lower plots) production.

Comparing the results from the massless approximation and our results with full\nb-quark mass dependence, one observes that for pbT > 15 GeV the massless approximation\n\noverestimates the total cross section by about 10%, while for pbT > 25 GeV the difference is\n\u221a\n\u221a\na milder 3% (both for s = 10 TeV and s = 14 TeV). As expected, the more inclusive\nthe treatment of the b jets the more important the b-quark mass effects become. This, for\nexample, explains why for a complete NLO treatment of W + 1 b-jet production, the contributions from the W bb\u0304 production process must be calculated using the full b-quark mass\ndependence, as discussed in [43].\nIn Figs.

Figure (2)\nshows that at NLO in QCD the production of b jets at large pbT is consistently suppressed\nin the exclusive case, while in the inclusive case the cross section for the production of a\nleading b jet is enhanced, yielding K factors of about 2 in the low pbT region and of about 3.5\nat large pbT . Similar features can be observed in the pW\nT distributions of Fig. (3). We note\nthat this may have an impact especially on assessing the effects of experimental triggers on\nthe lepton coming from the W -boson decay.

The\nincrease of the pseudorapidity distributions of the W bosons at NLO QCD, on the other\nhand, is more pronounced in the forward regions in both the inclusive and exclusive cases.\nFinally, we point out that the large positive corrections to the Rbb\u0304 distributions of Fig. (7)\nin regions with low and large values of Rbb\u0304 are especially pronounced in the inclusive case.\nAlthough these changes in shape are commonly seen in NLO QCD computations involving\ntwo or more jets, the large effects observed here in the inclusive case are a specific feature of\nW bb\u0304 production, originating from the tree-like qg-initiated contribution to the NLO QCD\ncorrections, as one can easily deduce from comparing with the exclusive K factors.\nFinally, we compared the distributions presented here to the ones produced by MCFM\nin the massless b-quark approximation. We agree very well, with only small (of the order\nof the change in the total cross sections shown in Table I) but noticeable deviations in\nregions where relevant kinematic observables become small, i. e. comparable to mb .

Details of the calculation have been given in Refs. [37, 38] and will\nnot be repeated here.\nAs done in the case of W + bb\u0304 and W \u2212 bb\u0304 production in Section III, we start our discussion of Zbb\u0304 cross sections at NLO QCD at the LHC by studying the renormalization- and\nfactorization-scale dependence of the LO and NLO total cross sections. In Fig. 9 we show\nthe scale dependence of the individual parton-level channels, as well as their sum, at LO and\nNLO in QCD for both the inclusive and exclusive case. As for W bb\u0304 production, we notice\nthe pronounced scale dependence of the NLO total cross section to qg(q\u0304g) \u2192 Zbb\u0304 + q(q\u0304).\nHowever, since in Zbb\u0304 production both the LO and NLO cross sections also consist of a\ngg-initiated subprocess, the qg(q\u0304g) \u2192 Zbb\u0304 + q(q\u0304) channel is not dominant at NLO and its\neffect is therefore less pronounced.

We compare the case\nof a massless and massive bottom quark and we observe that the effects of a non-zero bquark mass are mild for Zbb\u0304 production. Indeed, for pbt > 15 GeV the massless approximation\nmildly overestimates the total cross section by about 2 \u2212 3%, which in the inclusive case is\n\nconsiderably smaller than the scale uncertainty. For pbt > 25 GeV the difference is basically\n\ngone. We remind, however, that this is not the case in more inclusive studies, like Z + 1 b-jet\nproduction [44], where, as seen in W + 1 b-jet production [43], one needs to consistently\ninclude full b-quark mass effects.\nIn Figs.

In this paper we have presented a\nstudy of W and Z boson production with two b jets at the LHC including full b-quark\nmass effects, based on the NLO QCD calculation of W bb\u0304 and Zbb\u0304 production presented in\nRefs. [36, 37, 38]. We have presented numerical results for the total W bb\u0304 and Zbb\u0304 production\ncross sections, as well as for a number of kinematic distributions interesting to LHC physics,\nfor both massive (our calculation) and massless bottom quarks (as implemented in MCFM).\n18\n\n\fk-factor\n\nd\u03c3 / d\u03b7 [ pb / \u2206 \u03b7 ]\n\n50\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n45\n\npt > 15 GeV\n\n40\n\n|\u03b7| < 2.5\n\n35\n\nR = 0.7\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n-2\n\nECM = 14 TeV\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n_\n\n2\n\nLO\nNLO Inc\nNLO Exc\n\nZbb\n\n50\n45\n40\n35\n\n30\n\n30\n\n25\n\n25\n\n20\n\n20\n\n15\n\n15\n\n10\n\n10\n\n5\n\n5\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1.5\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0.5\n0\n\n0.5\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\nLeading b-Jet \u03b7\n\n2\n\n-2\n\nb,l\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\nSubleading b-Jet \u03b7\n\n2\n\n0\n\nb,sl\n\nFIG. 12: LO (black, dashed), NLO inclusive (red, solid) and NLO exclusive (blue, dot-dashed)\npseudorapidity distributions for the b jet with the leading (left hand side) and subleading (right\nhand side) transverse momentum in Zbb\u0304 production. The lower window shows the bin-by-bin K\nfactor, for the inclusive (red, solid) and exclusive (blue, dot-dashed) cases.\n\nThe W bb\u0304 cross sections at NLO QCD still suffer from a large theoretical uncertainty due\nto the unphysical renormalization- and factorization-scale dependence, which is particularly\npronounced in the inclusive case, and further theoretical improvements are warranted. In\nthe case of Zbb\u0304 production, the NLO QCD cross sections are well behaved, i. e. exhibit\nonly a mild residual scale dependence, in particular in the exclusive case. The shape of\ndistributions is changed significantly by NLO QCD corrections, such that they can not be\ncorrectly described by global K-factor rescalings. This is more dramatic in the case for\nW bb\u0304 production, in view of which including resummation effects, as well as consistent NLO\nshowering, might be of considerable importance.\nThe b-quark mass effects can impact the shape of the kinematic distributions, as shown\non the example of the mbb\u0304 and Rbb\u0304 distributions, in particular in phase space regions where\nthe relevant kinematic observable is of the order of mb . Apart from these regions, however,\nthese effects can be approximated by rescaling the NLO cross section for mb = 0 with the\nratio of LO cross sections for massive and massless bottom quarks as discussed in detail\nin [36, 37]. The total production cross sections are reduced by b-quark mass effects, and\nthe effect is more pronounced the smaller the applied pbT cut.
