Introduction.\n1.1. Aims. The modeling of interactions between ultrasonic waves and cracks\nis of great interest in many fields of applied mechanics. When the wavelengths are\nmuch larger than the width of the cracks, the latter are usually replaced by zerothickness interfaces with appropriate jump conditions. Linear models for crack-face\ninteractions have been widely developed [21]. However, these models do not prevent\nthe non-physical penetration of crack faces. In addition, laboratory experiments have\nshown that ultrasonic methods based on linear models often fail to detect partially\nclosed cracks [25].\nA well-known nonlinear model for cracks is the unilateral contact model [22, 12]. A\nmore realistic hyperbolic model accounting for the finite compressibility of crack faces\nunder normal loading conditions has been presented for applications in engineering [2]\nand geomechanical contexts [4]. The well-posedness and the numerical modeling of\nthe latter model in the context of 1-D linear elastodynamics was previously studied in\n[15]. The generation of harmonics and the distortion of simulated scattered velocity\nand stress waves were also observed.\nSubsequent numerical experiments have brought to light an interesting property.\nIn the case of a sinusoidal incident wave, the mean values of the elastic displacements\naround a crack were found to be discontinuous. The simulations conducted also indicated that the mean dilatation of the crack increases with the amplitude of the forcing\nlevels. This purely nonlinear phenomenon (the linear models predict no dilatation) is\nof physical interest: experimenters can measure the dilatation [14] and use the data\nobtained to deduce the properties of the crack.\nA preliminary theoretical study based on the use of a perturbation method was\npresented in [16]. An analytical expression for the dilatation was obtained in that\n\u2217 This\n\nwork was carried out with the support of the GdR 2501, CNRS, France.\nJ.A.

However, this expression gives only a local estimate, valid in the particular case of the hyperbolic model\nsubjected to very low sinusoidal forcing levels. The aim of the present study is to\nprovide a theoretical analysis which can be applied to any range of forcing levels and\nto a larger number of contact models.\n1.2. Design of the study. The present paper is organized as follows:\n\u2022 In section 2, the physical configuration is described. The family of strictly\nincreasing convex jump conditions dealt with in this study is introduced.\nNumerical simulations of the process of interest are presented;\n\u2022 In section 3, the problem is reduced to a nonautonomous differential equation.\nUp to section 6, only the case of sinusoidal forcing, which allows a complete\nunderstanding of the phenomena involved, is studied;\n\u2022 In section 4, preliminary results on the differential equation are presented.\nClassical tools for dynamical systems are used: Poincar\u00e9 map, phase portrait,\nlower and upper solutions [10, 18];\n\u2022 In section 5, the main qualitative results of this study are presented. The\nmean, maximum and minimum aperture of the crack are bounded, and local\nestimates for small forcing are also proved;\n\u2022 In section 6, some of the previous results are extended to non-monochromatic\nperiodic forcing conditions. The increase of the mean dilatation with the\nforcing parameter is proved in theorem 6.3. The most general quantitative\nresult of the paper is given in equation (6.6);\n\u2022 In section 7, some conclusions are drawn about the physical observables.\nSome future perspectives are also suggested.\n2.

Physical modeling. We consider the case of a single crack with rough\nfaces separating two media \u03a90 and \u03a91 , which are both linearly elastic and isotropic,\ntaking \u03c1 to denote the density and c to denote the elastic speed of the compressional\nwaves. These parameters are piecewise constant and may be discontinuous around\nthe crack: (\u03c10 , c0 ) if x \u2208 \u03a90 , (\u03c11 , c1 ) if x \u2208 \u03a91 . The media are subject to a constant\n\n\f3\n\nNONLINEAR CRACK AND ELASTIC WAVES\n\nstatic stress p. At rest, the distance between the planes of average height is \u03be0 (p) > 0\n(figure 2.1, left).\nElastic compressional waves are emitted by a singular source of stress at x = xs <\n\u03b1 in \u03a90 , where \u03b1 is a median plane of the actual flaw surface. The wave impacting\n\u03b1 gives rise to reflected (in \u03a90 ) and transmitted (in \u03a91 ) compressional waves. These\nperturbations in \u03a90 and \u03a91 are described by the 1-D elastodynamic equations\n\u03c1\n\n\u2202v\n\u2202\u03c3\n=\n,\n\u2202t\n\u2202x\n\n\u2202\u03c3\n\u2202v\n= \u03c1 c2\n+ S(t) \u03b4(x \u2212 xs ),\n\u2202t\n\u2202x\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere S(t) denotes the causal stress source, v = \u2202\u2202 ut is the elastic velocity, u is the\nelastic displacement, and \u03c3 is the elastic stress perturbation around p. The dynamic\nstresses induced by the elastic waves affect the thickness \u03be(t) of the crack (figure 2.1,\nright). The constraint\n\u03be = \u03be0 + [u] \u2265 \u03be0 \u2212 d > 0\n\n(2.2)\n\nmust be satisfied, where [u] = u+ \u2212 u\u2212 is the difference between the elastic displacements on the two sides of the crack, and d(p) > 0 is the maximum allowable closure\n[4]. We also assume that the wavelengths are much larger than \u03be, so that the propagation time across the crack is neglected, the latter being replaced by a zero-thickness\ninterface at x = \u03b1: [u] = [u(\u03b1, t)] = u(\u03b1+ , t) \u2212 u(\u03b1\u2212 , t).\n\u03c3*\n\n\u03c3*\n\nKd\nK\n\u2212d\n\n0\n\nK\n\n[u]\n\n\u2212d\n\n0\n\n[u]\n\nFig. 2.2. Sketch of the nonlinear relation between the stress and the jump of the elastic displacement at \u03b1. Left row: model 1 (2.7), right row: model 2 (2.8).\n\nTwo independent jump conditions at \u03b1 need to be defined to obtain a well-posed\nproblem. The discontinuity of \u03c3 is proportional to the mass of the interstitial medium\npresent between \u03a90 and \u03a91 [24]. Since the crack is dry and contains only air, the\ndensity of which is much smaller than \u03c10 or \u03c11 , the elastic stress is assumed to be\ncontinuous:\n[\u03c3(\u03b1, t)] = 0 \u21d2 \u03c3(\u03b1+ , t) = \u03c3(\u03b1\u2212 , t) = \u03c3 \u2217 (t).\n\n(2.3)\n\nEstablishing the second jump condition is a more complex task. Experimental and\ntheoretical studies have shown that u is discontinuous, and that the discontinuity is\nproportional to the stress applied. The linear model has often been considered [21]:\n\u03c3 \u2217 (t) = K [u(\u03b1, t)] ,\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhere K is the interfacial stiffness. Welded conditions [u(\u03b1, t)] = 0 are obtained if\nK \u2192 +\u221e. However, the linear condition (2.4) violates (2.2) under large compression\n\n\f4\n\nS. JUNCA AND B. LOMBARD\n\nloadings conditions: \u03c3 \u2217 (t) < \u2212K \u03b4 \u21d2 \u03be < \u03be0 \u2212 \u03b4. The linear condition (2.4) is\ntherefore realistic only with very small perturbations. With larger ones, a nonlinear\njump condition is required.\nTo develop this relation, it should be noted that compression loading increases\nthe surface area of the contacting faces. A smaller stress is therefore needed to open\nthan to close a crack; an infinite stress is even required to close the crack completely.\nIn addition, the constraint (2.2) must be satisfied, and the model must comply with\n(2.4) in the case of small stresses. Lastly, concave stress-closure relations have been\nobserved experimentally [17]. Dimensional analysis shows that the general relation\n\u03c3 \u2217 (t) = K d F ([u(\u03b1, t)]/d)\n\n(2.5)\n\nis suitable, where F is a smooth increasing concave function\nF : ] \u2212 1, +\u221e[\u2192] \u2212 \u221e, Fmax [,\nF (0) = 0,\n\n\u2032\n\nF (0) = 1,\n\nlim F (X) = \u2212\u221e,\n\nX\u2192\u22121\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n0 < Fmax \u2264 +\u221e,\n\n\u2032\n\nF <0<F .\n\n(2.6)\n\nTwo models illustrate the nonlinear relation (2.5). First, the so-called model 1 presented in [2, 4] is\n\u03c3 \u2217 (t) =\n\nK [u(\u03b1, t)]\nX\n\u21d4 F (X) =\n,\n1 + [u(\u03b1, t)] /d\n1+X\n\nFmax = 1.\n\n(2.7)\n\nSecondly, the so-called model 2 presented in [17] is\n\u03c3 \u2217 (t) = K d ln (1 + [u(\u03b1, t)]/d) \u21d4 F (X) = ln(1 + X),\n\nFmax = +\u221e.\n\n(2.8)\n\nThese two models are sketched in figure 2.2. The straight line with a slope K tangential to the curves at the origin gives the linear jump conditions (2.4).\n2.2. Numerical experiments. Here, we describe the influence of the nonlinear\njump condition (2.5) on the wave scattering. For this purpose, we consider a single\ncrack described by model 1 (2.7), a sinusoidal source S with a frequency of 50 Hz,\nand parameters\n(\n\u03c10 = \u03c11 = 1200 kg.m\u22123 , K = 1.3 109 kg.m\u22121 .s\u22122 ,\nc0 = c1 = 2800 m.s\u22121 ,\n\nd = 6.1 10\u22126 m.\n\nThe amplitude v0 of the incident elastic velocity ranges from 10\u22124 m/s to 5 10\u22123 m/s.\nThis latter maximal amplitude corresponds to a maximal strain \u03b5 = v0 /c0 \u2248 10\u22126 ,\nso that the linear elastodynamic equations (2.1) are always valid [1]. The linear\nfirst-order hyperbolic system (2.1) and the jump conditions (2.3) and (2.7) are solved\nnumerically on a (x, t) grid. For this purpose, a fourth-order finite-difference ADER\nscheme is combined with an immersed interface method to account for the jump\nconditions [15]. At each time step, numerical integration of v also gives u.\nFigure 2.3 shows snapshots of u after the transients have disappeared and the\nperiodic regime has been reached. The mean values of the incident and reflected displacements (x < \u03b1) and the transmitted displacement (x > \u03b1) are given by horizontal\ndotted lines.

Existence and uniqueness of a periodic solution Y . The T -periodic\nisocline of zero slope deduced from (3.10) is\nI0y (t) = f \u22121 (\u2212A sin \u03c9t).\n\n(4.1)\n\nProposition 4.1. There is a unique T -periodic solution Y (t) of (3.10). This\nsolution is asymptotically stable.\nProof. For the sequel, we denote Y0 = Y (0) the unique initial data such that the\nsolution of (3.10) is T -periodic. Three cases can be distinguished.\nCase 1: A = 0. Equation (3.10) becomes a scalar autonomous equation with the\n\u2032\nsteady state solution Y = 0. Since f is a C 1 function and f (0) = \u22121, the fixed point\n0 is asymptotically stable. In the case of model 1 (2.7), the exact solution is a known\nspecial function: y ey = y0 ey0 \u2212t \u21d2 y(t) = L (y0 ey0 \u2212t ), where L is the Lambert\nfunction [6].\nCase 2: 0 < A < |fmin |. The T -periodic isocline (4.1) is defined on R, with\nlower and upper bounds f \u22121 (A) < 0 and f \u22121 (\u2212A) > 0 (figure 4.1-a). Below I0y , we\nobtain dd yt > 0; and above I0y , we obtain dd yt < 0. Consequently, the null slope of the\nhorizontal line f \u22121 (A) is smaller than F (t, y) when these curves intersect, except at\nt = 3 T /4, where they are both equal to zero: f \u22121 (A) is called a weak lower fence\n\u2032\nfor (3.10) [10]. Similarly, F (t, y) \u2264 (f \u22121 (\u2212A)) = 0, where equality occurs only at\nT /4: f \u22121 (\u2212A) is called a weak upper fence for (3.10). Since y 7\u2192 F (t, y) is Lipschitz\ncontinuous, f \u22121 (\u00b1A) are nonporous fences: once a solution has crossed these fences,\n\n\f9\n\nNONLINEAR CRACK AND ELASTIC WAVES\n\nit cannot sneak through them [10]. Based on the funnel's theorem, the subset of the\n(t, y) plane defined by\n\u0002\n\u0003\nK = R+ \u00d7 K0 , K0 = f \u22121 (A), f \u22121 (\u2212A) ,\nis a funnel [10]: once a solution has entered K, it stays inside. Defining the subsets\n\b\n\b\nU + = t \u2265 0; \u22121 < y < f \u22121 (A) ,\nU \u2212 = t \u2265 0; y > f \u22121 (\u2212A) ,\n\nthe solution of (3.10) increases in U + and decreases in U \u2212 as t increases. In addition,\nzero slope dd yt = 0 in U \u00b1 occurs only at T /4 and 3 T /4. The solution therefore\nenters K in finite time, and K0 is invariant under the flow \u03c6 : R+ \u00d7] \u2212 1, +\u221e[\u2192\n] \u2212 1, +\u221e[; (t, y0 ) 7\u2192 y(t) = \u03c6(t, y0 ). The solutions of (3.10) are therefore always\nbounded, which ensures that the solutions are global solutions in time.\nThe invariance of K0 ensures \u03a0(K0 ) \u2282 K0 , with the Poincar\u00e9 map \u03a0 :]\u22121, +\u221e[\u2192\n] \u2212 1, +\u221e[; y0 7\u2192 \u03a0(y0 ) = \u03c6(T, y0 ). Since \u03a0 is continuous on K, it has at least one\nfixed point Y0 . The solutions Y (t) = \u03c6(t, Y0 ) and YT (t) = \u03c6(t + T, Y0 ) both satisfy\nthe same ODE with the same initial value: YT (0) = \u03c6(T, Y0 ) = \u03a0(Y0 ) = Y0 = Y (0).\nTherefore Y (t + T ) = Y (t) at all values of t, which proves that Y (t) is T -periodic.\n(a)\n2\n\n(b)\n\n5\n-1\n\nupper fence f (-A)\n4\n\n1.5\n\nisocline of zero slope\n\nisocline of zero slope\n3\n\n1\n\n2\n\nY\n\n0.5\n\nY\n1\n\n0\n\u22120.5\n\n0\n\nlower fence f -1(A)\n\n\u22121\n\nT1\n\n\u22121\n0\n\nT/4\n\nT/2\nt\n\n3T/4\n\nT\n\n0\n\nT/4\n\nT2\nlower fence f -1(A)\nT/2\nt\n\n3T/4\n\nT\n\nFig. 4.1.

Assuming that Y0 > \u1ef80 yields Y (t) > \u1ef8 (t) at all values of t \u2208 [0, T ], hence f (Y (t)) <\nf (\u1ef8 (t)). The integral forms of Y (T ) and \u1ef8 (T ), together with the T -periodicity, give\nZ T\u0010\n\u0011\nYT \u2212 \u1ef8T = Y0 \u2212 \u1ef80 +\nf (Y (t)) \u2212 f (\u1ef8 (t) dt < Y0 \u2212 \u1ef80 ,\n(4.2)\n0\n= Y0 \u2212 \u1ef80 .\nThis results in Y0 \u2212 \u1ef80 < Y0 \u2212 \u1ef80 , which is impossible. The opposite case Y0 < \u1ef80 can\nbe handled in the same way, which proves the uniqueness of the T -periodic solution.\nLastly, the properties of f in (3.10) mean that\nZ T\nZ T\n\u2032\n\u2202F\nf (\u03c6(t, y0 )) dt < 0,\n(4.3)\n(t, \u03c6(t, y0 )) dt =\na0 =\n\u2202y\n0\n0\n\n\f10\n\nS.

The set [f \u22121 (A), +\u221e[ is invariant under the flow but not compact.\nTo prove the existence of solutions at all time, let us examine the subset of the (t, y)\nplane where the solution can blow up: \u0393 = {0 < t < T /2; y > 0}. In \u0393, y > 0 and\nf (y) < 0, hence dd yt < A sin \u03c9t.

As long as y > 0, integration will ensure that\ny is bounded by a lower solution and an upper solution\ny0 + fmin t +\n\nA\nA\n(1 \u2212 cos \u03c9t) < y(t) < y0 +\n(1 \u2212 cos \u03c9t) .\n\u03c9\n\u03c9\n\nTaking y0 > |fmin | T , for instance y0 = 2 |fmin | T , ensures that y > 0 for all values of\nt \u2208 [0, T ] and that y(T ) < y0 . Therefore, upon defining the subset of the (t, y) plane\n\u0002\n\u0003\nK = R+ \u00d7 K0 , K0 = f \u22121 (A), 2 |fmin| T ,\n\nthen K0 is invariant under the Poincar\u00e9 map, yielding \u03a0(K0 ) \u2282 K0 . The same arguments as those given in case 2 hold here, which proves the existence, uniqueness and\nasymptotic stability of the T -periodic solution.\nAs seen in the previous proof, the phase portrait of (3.10) depends on A. However,\nthe evolution of Y with t is the same at all values of A, as seen in figure 4.1 and\nproved in section 5. Some auxiliary solutions are first introduced. These solutions\nmake it possible to investigate how the attractive periodic solution Y evolves with the\nparameter A.\n4.2. Auxiliary solutions. The first derivative of Y with respect to A is introduced: Z(t, A) = \u2202\u2202 YA .

In [0, T ], the T -periodic solution Z of (4.5) has two roots tZ1\nand tZ2 , which are ordered as follows:\n0 < tZ1 < T /2 < tZ2 < T.\nTherefore Z < 0 in [0, tZ1 [\u222a]tZ2 T ], and Z > 0 on ]tZ1 , tZ2 [.

From lemma 4.2 and the phase portrait\nof (4.5), it can be deduced that Z must cross the t-axis twice, at tZ1 and tZ2 in\n]0, T [. Let us assume tZ1 \u2265 T /2, where the isocline (4.6) is negative (figure 4.2).\nThen Z will intersect I0Z twice at negative values and will never cross the t-axis,\nwhich is impossible. After tZ1 , Z increases and intersects I0Z with a zero slope at\ntZ1 < t < T /2. It then decreases but cannot intersect again I0Z as long as I0Z > 0 i.e.\nat t < T /2. This means that tZ2 > T /2.\nTaking A = 0 results in Y = 0, as stated in the proof of proposition 4.1 (case 1),\nand hence (4.5) becomes the linear ODE\n\u2032\n\nZ = \u2212Z + sin \u03c9t,\nthe T -periodic solution of which is given in (4.8).\n(a)\n\n(b)\n7\n\n5\nisocline of zero slope\n\nisocline of zero\n\n6\n\n4\n\nslope\n\n5\n3\n\n4\n3\n\n2\n\nW\n\n2\nW\n\n1\n\n1\n0\n\n0\n0\n\nT/4\n\nT/2\nt\n\n3T/4\n\nT\n\n0\n\nT/4\n\nT/2\nt\n\n3T/4\n\nT\n\nFig. 4.3.

If W0 \u2264 0, the phase portrait of (4.9) entails that W (T ) > W0 , which is\ncontradictory with the T -periodicity of W : hence, W0 > 0. We then consider\n( \u2032\n\u2032\nw = f (Y ) w,\n0 < w(0) < W0 .\n\nSince f \u2032\u2032 > 0 and W0 > w(0), w is a lower solution of W , hence W (t) > w(t) at all t.\nHowever, the T -periodic lower solution is w = 0, which completes the proof.\nLemma 4.5. In the limit case of null forcing, the T -periodic solution W of (4.9)\ncontains only the harmonics sin 2\u03c9t and cos 2\u03c9t, and has a non-null mean value\n\u2032\u2032\n\nW (0) =\n\n1\nf (0)\n.\n2 1 + \u03c92\n\n(4.11)\n\nProof.

In the limit case of null forcing, the mean value of the T -periodic\nsolution X of (4.12) is X(0) = 0.\nProof.

Propositions 4.3 and 4.4 yield ddYA0 = Z(0, A) < 0 and dd AY20 = W (0, A) >\n0, which proves the convex decreasing of Y0 . Since Y0 (0) = Y (0, 0) = 0, then Y0 (A) \u2264\n0, which gives the upper bound of Y0 .\nWe now prove the lower bounds of Y0 . In the proof of proposition 4.1, it was\nestablished that f \u22121 (A) is a lower nonporous fence, which means that Y (t) \u2265 f \u22121 (A),\nand hence that Y0 \u2265 f \u22121 (A). On the other hand, lemma 4.2 and proposition 4.4\nshow that A 7\u2192 Y0 (A) is a convex function, which reaches a maximum at A = 0, with\nY0 (0) = 0. Y0 (A) is therefore always above the straight line going through the origin\nwith slope A \u2202\u2202 YA (0): Y0 \u2265 A Z0 (0), where Z0 (0) is deduced from (4.8).\nAt A \u226a 1, a Taylor expansion of Y is written as follows\nY0 (A) = Y0 (0) + A\n\n\u2202 Y0\n(0) + O(A2 ).\n\u2202A\n\nIf A = 0, then Y0 = Y = 0, and (4.8) again provides Z0 (0) =\n\n\u2202 Y0\n\u2202 A (0).\n\nThe evolution of Y0 with A is shown in figure 5.1.

The phase portrait of (3.10) and the proposition 5.1 mean that Y (t) must\ncross the t-axis twice, at tY1 and tY2 in ]0, T [. At t \u2265 T /2, the isocline I0y (4.1)\nis negative (figure 4.1). Consequently, tY1 \u2265 T /2 means that Y crosses I0y twice at\nnegative values of Y , preventing Y from crossing the t-axis, which is impossible.\nThe slope of Y is null at tYmax , which means that Y crosses I0y . This occurs\nonly when the slope of I0y is negative, between T /4 and 3 T /4. Since I0y must also\nbe positive at the intersection point, it is possible only when T /4 < tYmax < T /2. Y\nsubsequently decreases but cannot cross the t-axis as long as I0y positive, which means\nthat tY2 > T /2.\nLastly, the slope of Y is equal to zero at tYmin , which means that Y crosses I0y .\nThis is possible only when the slope of I0y is positive. Since I0y must also be negative,\nthis means that tYmin > 3 T /4.\nTo prove the local estimates, a Taylor expansion of Y is written as follows\nY (t, A) =\n=\n\n\u2202Y\n(t, 0) + O(A2 ),\n\u2202A\nA Z(t, 0) + O(A2 ).\n\nY (t, 0) + A\n\n\f16\n\nS.

The\nfollowing properties are assumed to hold whatever the value of \u03bb in \u039b:\n(i) h+ (\u03bb) = sup h(z, \u03bb) is reached at a single point z + (\u03bb) \u2208 I;\nz\u2208I\n\n\u22022 h +\n(z (\u03bb), \u03bb) < 0;\n(ii)\n\u2202 z2\n\u2202h\n\u22022 h\n(iii) \u2200z \u2208 I,\n> 0.\n> 0,\n\u2202\u03bb\n\u2202 \u03bb2\n+\n2\nThen h (\u03bb) \u2208 C (I, R), and \u03bb 7\u2192 h+ (\u03bb) is a strictly increasing and convex function.\nProof. The definition of z + in (i) gives\n\n2\n\n\u0001\n\u2202h +\nz (\u03bb), \u03bb = 0.\n\u2202z\n\n(5.3)\n\nIn addition, (ii) ensures that \u2202\u2202 zh2 (z + (\u03bb), \u03bb) 6= 0. The implicit function theorem can\nbe applied to \u2202\u2202 hz \u2208 C 2 (I \u00d7 \u039b, R): therefore, \u03bb 7\u2192 z + (\u03bb) \u2208 C 2 (\u039b, R), and h+ (\u03bb) =\nh(z + , \u03bb) \u2208 C 2 (I, R).\nBased on the first property in (iii) and (5.3),\nd h+\n(\u03bb)\nd\u03bb\n\n\u2202h +\n\u2202h +\nd z+\n(z , \u03bb) +\n(z , \u03bb)\n,\n\u2202\u03bb\n\u2202z\nd\u03bb\n\u2202h +\n(z , \u03bb) > 0,\n=\n\u2202\u03bb\nwhich proves that h+ is a strictly increasing function of \u03bb. On the other hand,\ndifferentiating (5.3) in terms of \u03bb gives\n=\n\n\u22022 h\nd z+\n\u22022 h +\n(z , \u03bb)\n(z + , \u03bb) +\n= 0.\n2\n\u2202 \u03bb\u2202 z\nd\u03bb\n\u2202z\n\n(5.4)\n\n\f19\n\nNONLINEAR CRACK AND ELASTIC WAVES\n\nUsing (ii), the second property in (iii), and (5.4), we obtain\nd2 h+\n(\u03bb)\nd \u03bb2\n\nd z+\n\u22022 h +\n\u22022 h\n+\n2 (z , \u03bb) + \u2202 z \u2202 \u03bb (z , \u03bb) d \u03bb ,\n\u2202\u03bb\n\u0012 + \u00132\n\u22022 h +\ndz\n\u22022 h +\n(z , \u03bb) \u2212\n(z , \u03bb)\n> 0,\nd\u03bb\n\u2202 \u03bb2\n\u2202 z2\n\n=\n=\n\nwhich proves that h+ is a strictly convex function of \u03bb.\nTheorem 5.6.

To analyse the evolution of Ymax in terms of A, we proceed in three steps.\nFirst, the phase portrait of Y and the proposition 5.2 show that Y (t, A) reaches its\nmaximum value at a single time between T /4 and T /2. Secondly, the definition of\ntYmax and proposition 5.2 give\n\u22022 Y\n(tYmax , A) =\n\u2202 t2\n=\n\n\u2032\n\nf (Ymax )\n\n\u2202Y\n(tYmax , A) + A \u03c9 cos \u03c9tYmax ,\n\u2202t\n\nA \u03c9 cos \u03c9tYmax < 0.\n2\n\nThirdly, corollary 5.3 and proposition 4.4 yield \u2202\u2202 YA > 0 and \u2202\u2202 YA2 > 0 on [T /4, T /2].\nThe three hypotheses in lemma 5.5 are therefore satisfied, which proves the convex\nincreasing of Ymax with A.\n\n\f20\n\nS. JUNCA AND B. LOMBARD\n\nThe bounds of Ymax are proved by building upper and lower solutions of Y , as\nin the proof of proposition 4.1, case 3. In ]tY1 , tYmax [, proposition 5.2 ensures Y > 0,\nwhich means that fmin < f (Y ) < 0, and hence fmin + A sin \u03c9t < ddYt < A sin \u03c9t.\nIntegrating this inequality from tY1 to tYmax gives\nA\nA\n(cos \u03c9tY1 \u2212 cos \u03c9tYmax ) + (tY1 \u2212 tYmax ) |fmin | < Ymax <\n(cos \u03c9tY1 \u2212 cos \u03c9tYmax ) .\n\u03c9\n\u03c9\nProposition 5.2 and corollary 5.3-(iii) give the bounds T /4 < tYmax < T /2 and 0 <\ntY1 < \u03b8/\u03c9, and hence\n(\ncos \u03b8 < cos \u03c9tY1 < 1,\n0 < \u2212 cos \u03c9tYmax < 1.\n\nThese inequalities, together with the definition of \u03b8 in (4.8), yield\nA\n1\nA\n2A\n\u221a\n<\n(cos \u03c9tY1 \u2212 cos \u03c9tYmax ) <\n.\n\u03c9 1 + \u03c92\n\u03c9\n\u03c9\nProposition 5.2 also gives tY1 \u2212 tYmax > \u2212T /2, which gives the upper bound and a first\nlower bound in \u221a\n(5.5). The latter lower bound is not always an optimum bound: when\nA < T2 |fmin| \u03c9 1 + \u03c9 2 , it is negative, whereas proposition 5.2 states that Ymax > 0\nat all values of A. We therefore take advantage of the convex increasing of Ymax with\nA, which was previously proved. Since Ymax (0) = 0, then Ymax (A) is always above the\nstraight line going through the origin with the slope A Z(tYmax (0+ ), 0). Proposition\n5.2 and equation (4.8) therefore give a second lower bound in (5.5). A second-order\nTaylor expansion of Ymax (A) proves that this lower bound is also the local estimate\nof Ymax when A \u226a 1.\nThe evolution of Ymax stated in theorem 5.6 is shown in figure 5.4. If |fmin\n\u221a |<\u221e\n\u03c9\nand \u03c9 6= 1, the two lower bounds given in (5.5) intersect at A = T2 |fmin | 1\u2212\u03c9\n1 + \u03c92.\nAt higher values of A, the second lower bound is more accurate than the first one.\n(a)\n\n0\n\n(b)\n\n0\n\n\u22120.2\n\u22120.4\n\nminimum value of Y\n\nminimum value of Y\n\n\u22120.2\n\u22120.4\n\nYmin\n\n\u22120.6\n\n\u22120.6\n\nlower bound\n\n\u22120.8\n\n\u22120.8\n\nlocal estimate\n\n\u22121\n\nYmin\nlower bound\nlocal estimate\n\n\u22121\n0\n\n0.4\n\n0.8\n\n1.2\n\n1.6\n\n2\n\n0\n\n4\n\nA\n\n8\n\n12\n\n16\n\n20\n\nA\n\nFig. 5.5.

At moderate\nforcing levels (a), one cannot distinguish between Ymin and its lower bound. At higher\nforcing levels (b), one observes that Ymin is above its lower bound, as stated in theorem\n5.7. Although no rigorous proof has been obtained so far, the numerical simulations\nindicate that Ymin decreases strictly as A increases.\n6. Generalization.\n6.1. Periodic forcing. Most of the results obtained in sections 4 and 5 were\nbased on the simple analytical expression of sinusoidal forcing. In the case of more\ngeneral forcing, the key properties stated in proposition 5.2 and corollary 5.3 are lost,\nwhich makes it impossible to obtain estimates such as theorems 5.6 and 5.7. However,\nsome properties are maintained if two assumptions are made about S in (3.1): T0 periodicity, and a null mean value. The latter assumption is physically meaningfull:\nas deduced from (3.7), a non-null mean value of S results in an amplitude of uI that\nincreases linearly with t.\nSince the techniques required are the same as those used in the above sections, the\nderivations will be shortened. Setting the parameters and the Fourier decomposition\nof the source as follows\n[u(\u03b1, t)]\n2 v0\n1\n, y=\n, f (y) = \u2212F (y),\nmax |S(t/\u03b2)| , A =\nv0 =\n\u03b2d\nd\n2 \u03c10 c20 t\u2208[0, T ]\n\u221e\nX\n1\n2\u03c0\ng(t) =\n,\n|S(t/\u03b2)|\n=\n(an sin n\u03c9t + bn cos n\u03c9t) , T = \u03b2 T0 , \u03c9 =\n2\nT\n2 \u03c10 c0 v0\nn=1\n(6.1)\n\n\fNONLINEAR CRACK AND ELASTIC WAVES\n\nwe obtain the model problem\n\uf8f1\ndy\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n= f (y) + A g(t) = F (t, y),\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\ndt\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4 f : ] \u2212 1, +\u221e[\u2192]fmin, +\u221e[,\nlim f (y) = +\u221e, \u2212\u221e \u2264 fmin < 0,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\ny\u2192\u22121\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\nf (0) = 0, f (0) = \u22121, f (y) < 0 < f (y),\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nmax |g(t)| = 1, 0 \u2264 A < +\u221e,\ng(t + T ) = g(t), g = 0, |g(t)| \u2264 1,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nt\u2208[0, T ]\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\ny(0) = y0 \u2208] \u2212 1, +\u221e[.\n\n23\n\n(6.2)\n\nThe isocline of zero slope of (6.2) is\n\nI0y (t) = f \u22121 (\u2212A g(t)).\n\n(6.3)\n\n6.2. Periodic solution. The following result generalizes the proposition 4.1:\nsince the same notations and processes are used, the proof is only sketched here.\nProposition 6.1. There is a unique T -periodic solution Y (t) of (6.2). This\nsolution is asymptotically stable.\nProof. Three cases can be distinguished.\nCase 1: A = 0. This case is identical to case 1 in proposition 4.1.\nCase 2: 0 < A < |fmin |. Based on the funnel's theorem, the compact set\n\u0002\n\u0003\nK0 = f \u22121 (A), f \u22121 (\u2212A)\n\nis invariant under the flow of (6.2), and hence \u03a0(K0 ) \u2282 K0 . A fixed point argument\nshows the existence of a T -periodic solution Y . Equations (4.2) and (4.3) still hold:\n\u2032\nthe uniqueness and attractivity of Y are straightforward consequences of f (y) < 0.\nCase 3: A \u2265 |fmin |. The isocline (6.3) is not defined when A g(t) \u2265 \u2212fmin .\nIn these cases, the invariant set deduced from the isocline is the non-compact set\n[f \u22121 (A), +\u221e[, which makes it impossible to apply the fixed point argument. To build\na compact invariant set, we take y > 0, which means that fmin +A g(t) < dd yt < A g(t).\nAs long as y > 0, integration gives lower and upper solutions of y\nZ t\nZ t\ny0 + fmin t +\nA g(\u03be) d\u03be < y(t) < y0 +\nA g(\u03be) d\u03be.\n0\n\n0\n\nFrom the T -periodicity of g, it follows that\ny0 + fmin T < y(T ) < y0 .\nIt is then only necessary to bound y0 to establish that y > 0 on [0, T ]. Setting\ngmin = min g(t) < 0,\nt\u2208[0, T ]\n\nthe lower solution of y gives\ny0 \u2212 t (|fmin | + A|gmin |) \u2264 y(t),\n\n\u2200t \u2208 [0, T ].\n\nTaking y0 > T (|fmin| + A|gmin |) therefore gives y > 0. The compact set\n\u0002\n\u0003\nK0 = f \u22121 (A), 2 T (|fmin | + A|gmin |)\n\nis therefore invariant under the Poincar\u00e9 map, which completes the proof.\n\n\f24\n\nS. JUNCA AND B. LOMBARD\n\n6.3. Auxiliary solution. Like in section 4, the first derivative of Y with respect\nto A is introduced: Z(t, A) = \u2202\u2202 YA . Applying the chain-rule to (6.2) shows that the\nT -periodic solution Z satisfies\n\u2032\ndZ\n= f (Y ) Z + g(t).\ndt\n\n(6.4)\n\nLemma 6.2.

Null forcing gives Y = 0, hence (6.4) becomes\ndZ\n= \u2212Z + g(t).\ndt\nThis equation is integrated over [0, T ]. T -periodicity of Z and g = 0 yield Z(0) = 0.\nThe solution Z is therefore sought as a Fourier series with null mean value\nZ(t, 0) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n(An sin n\u03c9t + Bn cos n\u03c9t) .\n\nn=1\n\nInjecting this series in the ODE satisfied by Z(t, 0) and using (6.1) provides\nAn =\n\nan + n \u03c9 b n\n2\n\n1 + (n \u03c9)\n\n,\n\nBn =\n\nb n \u2212 n \u03c9 an\n2\n\n1 + (n \u03c9)\n\n,\n\nwith\n\nA2n + Bn2 =\n\na2n + b2n\n\n2.\n\n1 + (n \u03c9)\n\nNow, Parseval's formula leads to the last equality in (6.5).\n6.4. Mean dilatation of the crack. The next result extends the theorem 5.4.\nIt shows that a positive jump in the mean elastic displacement still occurs.\nTheorem 6.3. The mean value of the T -periodic solution Y in (6.2) is positive\nand increases strictly with the forcing amplitude:\nY > 0,\n\n\u2202Y\n> 0.\n\u2202A\n\nAt small forcing levels, the following local estimate holds\n\u0012 \u00132 X\n\u221e\n\u0001\nA\na2n + b2n\n3\n,\nY = f (0)\n2 +O A\n2\nn=1 1 + (n \u03c9)\n\u2032\u2032\n\n(6.6)\n\nwhere an and bn are the Fourier coefficients of the source (6.1).\nProof. Based on the T -periodicity and the null mean value of g, the proof of\ntheorem 5.4 can be straightforwardly extended to prove Y > 0. To prove the second\ninequality, we proceed in three steps. First, as stated in the proof of proposition 6.1,\nnull forcing gives Y = 0, and hence Y (0) = 0. Secondly, lemma 6.2 gives Z(0) = 0.\n2\n\u2032\nZ\nThirdly, the T -periodic function W = \u2202\u2202 AY2 = \u2202\u2202 A\nsatisfies (4.9).

We therefore obtain W (A) > 0, and\nhence Z(A) > Z(0) = 0, which proves the second inequality.\nLastly, a Taylor expansion of Y when A \u226a 1 gives\nY (A)\n\n\u2202Y\nA2 \u2202 2 Y\n(0) + O(A3 ),\n(0) +\n\u2202A\n2 \u2202 A2\n\n=\n\nY (0) + A\n\n=\n\nA2\nW (0) + O(A3 ).\n2\n\nElementary calculations on (4.9) lead to\n\u2032\u2032\n\nW (0) = f (0) Z 2 (0),\nwhere Z 2 (0) is given in (6.5), which completes the proof.\nIn the case of a pure sinusoidal source, a1 = 1 and an>1 = bn = 0: the estimate\n(6.6) recovers the estimate (5.2).\n7. Conclusion.\n7.1. Physical observables. A set of nondimensionalized parameters was used\nthroughout this study. To recover the physical observables, we recall (3.9) and (6.1).\nThe results of physical interest are as follows.\n\u2022 Theorems 5.4 and 6.3: mean dilatation of the crack\n\u2202 [u]\n> 0,\n\u2202 \u03b2v0d\n\n[u] > 0,\n\n\u0012 3 \u0013\n\u221e\na2n + b2n\nv02 X\nv0\n,\n[u] = F (0) 2\n2 +O\n\u03b2 d n=1 1 + (n \u03a9 / \u03b2)\n\u03b2 3 d2\n\n(7.1)\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\nwhere an and bn are the Fourier coefficients of the normalized source. The\nmain aim of the present study was to establish the validity of the inequalities\nin (7.1) with any set of parameters. In the case of model 1 (2.7) and a\nmonochromatic source (3.8), the local estimate obtained here matches the\ntheoretical expression obtained in our previous study using a perturbation\nanalysis method [16]. In the local estimate of (7.1), an improvement of one\norder of accuracy is reached with a purely monochromatic source: see (5.2).\nLastly, note that the local estimate with model 1 is twice that obtained with\nmodel 2 (2.8).\n\u2022 Theorem 5.6: maximum aperture of the crack (monochromatic source only)\n\u2202 2 [u]max\n\u2202 [u]max\n>\n0,\n\u0010 \u00112 > 0,\n\u2202 \u03b2v0d\n\u2202 \u03b2v0d\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n1\n1\n+\n\u03a9/\u03b2\n2\nv\n2\n\u03c0\n\u03b2\nd\n4 v0\n2\nv\n0\n0\nq\nq\n,\n\u2212\n|Fmax |\uf8f8 \u2264 [u]max \u2264\n,\nmax \uf8ed\n\u03b2\n\u03a9\n\u03a9\n\u03a9\n2\n2\n1 + (\u03a9/\u03b2)\n1 + (\u03a9/\u03b2)\n[u]max\n\n2 v0\n1\nq\n=\n+O\n\u03b2\n2\n1 + (\u03a9/\u03b2)\n\n\u0012\n\nv02\n\u03b22 d\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n(7.2)\n\n\f26\n\nS.

Acoustic determination of the contact law. One of the applications of\nthe present study is the characterization of the crack model, in particular the finite\ncompressibility of the crack. This data is crucial in geomechanics and geohydrology,\nwhere it is linked to the transport of fluids across fractured rocks [3]. If [u], the source,\nand the physical parameters of \u03a90 and \u03a91 are known, then the second equation in (7.1)\n\u2032\u2032\nprovides a straightforward mean of determining |F (0)|/d. Note that the stiffness K,\nwhich is involved in \u03b2 via the proposition 3.1, is classically measured using acoustic\nmethods [21]. It then suffices to measure [u]. For this purpose, two possible methods\ncome to mind.\nThe first method consists in measuring the dilatation of the crack mechanically.\nThis requires installing two strain gauges around the crack [14]. However, in many\ncontexts such as those encountered in geosciences, this is not practicable. The second\nmethod consists in performing acoustic measurements of the diffracted elastic waves\nfar from the crack. The proposition 4.1 can be used here, by writing the Fourier series\nof incident, reflected, and transmitted elastic displacements\nv0\n{cos(\u03a9 t \u2212 k0 x) \u2212 1} ,\nuI (x, t) =\n\u03a9\n\u221e\nX\n\b a\nRn sin n (\u03a9 t + k0 x) + Rnb cos n (\u03a9 t + k0 x) ,\nuR (x, t) = R0a +\n(7.4)\nn=1\n\u221e\nX\b\nTna sin n (\u03a9 t \u2212 k1 x) + Tnb cos n (\u03a9 t \u2212 k1 x) ,\nuT (x, t) = T0a +\nn=1\n\nwhere k0 = \u03a9/c1 and k1 = \u03a9/c1 . Definition of [u] implies\n[u] = T0a \u2212 R0a +\n\nv0\n.\n\u03a9\n\n(7.5)\n\nOn the other hand, the causality of the source and the continuity of the stress (2.3)\nmean that\n\u03c10 c0 v0\n\u03c11 c1 T0a + \u03c10 c0 R0a = \u2212\n.\n(7.6)\n\u03a9\nSolving (7.5) and (7.6) gives\n[u] =\n=\n\n\u03c10 c0 + \u03c11 c1 a \u03c11 c1 \u2212 \u03c10 c0 v0\nR0 +\n,\n\u03c11 c 1\n\u03c11 c 1\n\u03a9\nv0\n\u03c10 c 0 + \u03c11 c 1 a\nT0 + 2 .\n\u03c10 c 0\n\u03a9\n\n\u2212\n\n(7.7)\n\n\fNONLINEAR CRACK AND ELASTIC WAVES\n\n27\n\nPurely acoustic measurements of R0a or T0a therefore give [u], from which the nonlinear\ncrack parameter can be easily determined.\n7.3. Future lines of investigation. The monotonicity of F in (2.6) - or equivalently f in (3.9) and (6.1) - was the key ingredient used here to prove the properties\nof the crack: the strict increasing of F - or the strict decreasing of f - proves the\nuniqueness and attractivity of the periodic solution. In addition, the strict concavity of F - or the strict convexity of f - shows that the mean value of the solution\nincreases with the forcing parameter. Relaxing these hypotheses may lead to more\ncomplex situations, and require more sophisticated tools. One thinks for instance to\nthe case of hysteretic models of interfaces [11, 7].\nThis paper was focused on the normal finite compressibility of a crack. Coupling\nwith shear stress is also an important topic to examine [20].\nLastly, further studies are also needed on networks of nonlinear cracks [23]. These\nconfigurations frequently occur in applications. Direct numerical simulations have\nbeen carried out in [16], but a rigorous mathematical analysis is still required.\nAcknowledgments.
