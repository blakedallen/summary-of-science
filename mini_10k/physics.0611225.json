Physical basis and model approximation\n\n2\n\n3. Conclusion\n\n10\n\n1. Introduction\nConverters of neutron radiation play the crucial role during development of detectors\nbecause they determine the basic characteristics of detectors, i.e. \u2013 the efficiency of\nregistration, as well as both energetic and spatial resolution of the detector.\nGase-filled and solid-state converters of slow neutrons are widely used now. Several\ntypes of nuclear reactions are used in these converters. The most well-known among them are\n3\n\nHe and 10BF3 converters. It should be mentioned that gas-filled converters are used in the wide\n\nclass of gas-filled detectors [1],[2],[3]. Solid-state converters are used in gas-filled as well as in\nboth scintillation and semiconductor detectors. But solid-state converters are rarely used in the\ndetectors of neutrons; this is related first of all to their low efficiency of registration. Thus, the\nregistration efficiency of detectors based on\n\n10\n\n\u0412 and 6Li as usual does not exceed 3-4 % and 1\n\n%, respectively (see [1], [4]).\nAmong the solid-state converters of thermal neutrons, the highest registration efficiency\nup to 30 % is received using converters on the basis of gadolinium and especially its 157\nisotope [5], [6]. In the paper [7] simulation of the registration efficiency of thermal neutrons by\nthe gadolinium foil converters was performed. The following conditions were considered in this\nsimulation: neutron flux (with 2 fixed energies) perpendicularly fell on to the surface of the\nconverting foil of various thicknesses; the secondary electron escapes to the frontward and\nbackward hemispheres were calculated. As a result, the detector on the basis of multi-wire\nproportional chamber with gadolinium converter has been developed. However, this kind of\ndetector does not possess well enough spatial resolution; it is just about 10 mm. In order to\nimprove the spatial resolution the same authors suggested to use the converter-collimator,\nwhich was a sandwich of alternating lead foils interlaid by glass textolite with holes drilled in\n\n\fthem by fine steps. This converter was pressed against a gadolinium foil and thus it limited the\nelectron tracks in gas, simultaneously serving as an emitter of secondary electrons. It helped to\nimprove the spatial resolution up to 2 mm, but the spatial resolution has turned out to be\nmodulated by the step of apertures, moreover the efficiency of registration has sharply fallen [8].\nFurther, during the development of multi-step avalanche chambers with the gadolinium\nconverters the spatial resolution of detectors was improved significantly (up to 1 mm) without\nusing Jeavons converter [9].\nRecently many authors were engaged in the development of detectors on the basis of\ngadolinium converters [10],[11],[12],[13],[14],[15],[16]. Simulations of the registration efficiency\nof thermal neutrons are also performed [17],[18],[19]. This fact testifies a significant interest to\nthe gadolinium converters.\nIt is worth to mention that modeling of the processes of neutron capture by gadolinium\nnuclei recently found it application also in beam therapy in order to decrease dozes of radiation\nreceived by oncological patients during their treatment. Recently, since 2000, the new direction\nin oncology and treatment of cancer tumors has started to develop, which is called gadolinium\nneutron capture therapy (GdNCT) [20]. The method is based on the injection of gadolinium\nnuclei to the organism of patient in the composition of medicinal products and their selective\nabsorption by the malignant tumor cells. Thus gadolinium nuclei, which have an extraordinary\nhigh section of interaction with thermal neutrons, allow to localize influence of radiation in the\narea of cancer cells. Therefore the basic radiation exposure is provided by both low-energy\ninternal conversion electrons and Auger electrons.\nIn our previous calculations of the registration efficiency of Gd-based detectors [17] we\nused data on internal conversion coefficients from the paper [21]. There are more precise new\ndata now [22]. Analysis of these data had shown that we could improve our calculations and\nobtain more accurate results. This fact stimulated us to perform new calculations.\nIn this work we will carry out model calculation of the efficiency of registration of thermal\nneutrons by the foil converters made of natural gadolinium and its 157 isotope. Also we\ncompare our obtained modeling data with the experimental results.\n\n\f2. Physical basis and model approximation\n\nIn the process of the capture of thermal neutrons by gadolinium nuclei, in addition to the\nradioactive \u03b3-quanta, here both internal conversion electrons and Auger electrons are being\nemitted. These are the electrons that are mainly registered by the position sensitive detectors\nand especially by the gas-filled ones, which have low \u03b3-quanta registration efficiency. Therefore,\nin our calculations, we take into account only those electrons, which arise as a result of neutron\nconversion on gadolinium nuclei.\nAs it is well-known, natural gadolinium is a mixture of isotopes that could participate in\nthe (n, \u03b3) nuclear reaction. Table 1 summarizes the main characters of Gd isotopes, including\ntheir cross sections of interactions with neutrons, daughter isotopes and half-decay periods of\nunstable daughter isotopes [23].\nTable 1\nIsotope\n\nAbundance\n\nCross section (b)\n\nDaughter\n\nT1/2\n\nisotope\nnat\n\nGd\n\n152\n\nGd\n\n154\n\nGd\n\n100\n0.2\n2.2\n\n48890\n\n-\n\n1100\n\n153\n\n241.6 d\n\n90\n\n155\n\nStable\nStable\n\nGd\nGd\n\n155\n\n14.7\n\n61000\n\n156\n\n156\n\n20.6\n\n2.0\n\n157\n\nStable\n\n255000\n\n158\n\nStable\n\n2.4\n\n159\n\n18.6 h\n\n0.8\n\n161\n\n3.66 min\n\nGd\nGd\n\n157\n\nGd\n\n158\n\nGd\n\n160\n\nGd\n\n15.68\n24.9\n21.9\n\nGd\nGd\nGd\nGd\nGd\n\nAs one can see in this table, the most interesting for our calculations are natural Gd and\nits 155 and 157 isotopes, which have abnormally high cross sections of interaction with\nneutrons.

Nucleus eliminates its excitation by the irradiation of gamma-quantum, but it also can emit\nthe close located electrons. As usual the K-electron (electron from the K-shell) is emitted, but an\nelectron from the higher shell (like L, M, N and so on) also could be emitted. Created electron\nvacancy (the electron hole) is filled by another electron from the higher level. This process is\naccompanied by X-ray irradiation, or by the irradiation of Auger electron.\nThe effect of internal conversion is accompanied by the significant X-ray radiation, which\ncould positively affect on the use of scintillation detectors with the fine-dispersed gadolinium.\nWe will only consider electrons with the energies higher than 20 keV.\nData on coefficients of internal conversion are different in various sources [21] that lead to\nthe divergences in quantity of the secondary electrons. In our last modeling, we based on the\nlast data presented in the database [22].\n\n\fIn the Table 3 the most intensive lines of electrons are given, whose probability of\nemission exceeds 0.03/100 neutrons, for the energies of primary gamma quantum less than 1\n\u041ceV. Data on Auger electrons which are formed during the K-shell filling are presented as well.\nThe maximum number of formed vacancies on K-shell (electron holes) does not exceed 45.2 to\n100 falling neutrons.\n\nTable 3\n\nElectron\n\nElectron output\n\nElectron path in\n\nEnergy of\n\nComment,\n\nEnergies\n\n1/100 n\n\nGadolinium\n\nprimary\n\nlevel\n\n(\u03bcm)\n\ngamma\n\n(keV)\n\nquantum\n29.3\n\n35,58\n\n4,7\n\n79.51\n\nK\n\n34.9\n\n7.9\n\n6,29\n\n71.7\n\n5,57\n\n20,7\n\n79.51\n\nL\n\n78\n\n1,2\n\n23,78\n\n79.51\n\nM\n\n131.7\n\n6,96\n\n55,70\n\n181.93\n\nK\n\n174.1\n\n0,99\n\n86,27\n\n181.93\n\nL\n\n180.4\n\n0,21\n\n91,23\n\n181.93\n\nM\n\n205.4\n\n0,14\n\n111,47\n\n255.66\n\nK\n\n227.3\n\n0,16\n\n130,27\n\n277.54\n\nK\n\n729.9\n\n0,03\n\n649,38\n\n780.14\n\nK\n\n893.85\n\n0,06\n\n830,05\n\n944.09\n\nK\n\n911.8\n\n0,04\n\n849,83\n\n960\n\nK\n\n926.8\n\n0,03\n\n866,35\n\n975.4\n\nK\n\nK- Auger\n\nIn our calculations, totally 444 discrete electron energies with the output probability of\nmore than 10-5 on 100 falling neutrons were considered. On fig. 2 the histogram is presented,\nwhich shows the dependence of the most intensive lines of electron intensity on their energy.\nThe most important characteristic of converter is the probability of secondary electron\noutput, emitted during the irradiative capture of neutrons by the substance of converter. Since,\ngenerally, electrons have low energies and small paths in the substance of converter it puts\nforward the additional requirements to the thickness of the converter.\nThe absorption coefficient F0 characterizes probability of absorption of electrons in the\nsubstance. If \u0425 is thickness of the converter, Re is an electron path in the substance of\nconverter, then\n\n\fF0 (X) = 1 \u2013 X * \u03c1 / Re\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c1 is density of the substance of converter. For gadolinium it is \u03c1 = 7, 9 g/\u0441m3.\nFig. 3 shows the dependence of the electron path in gadolinium (g/cm2) on their energy\n[25]. Size Re is defined both by the electron energy and by the specific ionization loss value\n\nE\n\nRe =\n\n\u222b dE(-dE/dX)\n\n.\n\n(2)\n\n0\n\nAttenuation of narrow collimated neutron beam in a thin layer of the substance is governed\nby the exponential law\n\nFx = F0 exp (-NA \u03c3 X)\n\n(3)\n\nwhere Fx and F0 are the neutron flux density after and before its passage through the layer of\nthe material with the thickness \u0425, respectively, NA is the number of nucleus in the volume of 1\n\u0441m3, \u03c3 is full microscopic cross-section of neutron interaction with the nuclei of substance.\nIn our calculations we will use four fixed neutron energies corresponding to thermal area.\nThese are neutrons with wavelengths of 1, 1.8, 3 and 4 \u04100. In table 4 their wavelengths,\ncorresponding energies (eV) and velocities (m/s) are shown.\nTable 4\nCapture Cross\nVelocity of\n\nSection\n\nWave Length\n\nEnergy of\n\nNeutrons\n\n(barns) for\n\nAO\n\nNeutrons (eV)\n\n(m/s)\n\nNatGd\n\nCapture Cross\nSection (barns)\nfor 157Gd\n\n1\n\n0,081894\n\n3955\n\n13 563.56\n\n75 323.47\n\n1,8\n\n0,025276\n\n2197,2\n\n48 149.41\n\n253 778.40\n\n3\n\n0,0090993\n\n1318,3\n\n70 597.77\n\n367 842.60\n\n4\n\n0,0051184\n\n988,76\n\n89 066.84\n\n464 373.40\n\n\fFig. 4 depicts the dependence of cross-section (barn) on the energy of incident neutrons\n(eV), for natural gadolinium and the same dependence for its 157 isotope [26]. Arrows indicate\nenergy of neutrons for which we will carry out our calculations. As one can see, with the\nreduction of energy of neutrons the cross-section of interaction strongly increases. Especially it\nincreases in the region of cold and ultra cold neutrons.\nModeling was realized by examining the simplest targets, namely the plane-parallel foils.\nThe calculations for thermal neutrons with the fixed energies, which correspond to neutron\nwavelength of 1, 1.8, 3 and 4 A0 were carried out; also both the thickness of converters from 1\n\u03bcm to 40 \u03bcm, and isotopic composition of converter (for natural Gd and 157Gd) were varied.\nIn the calculation all electrons (appeared as a result of neutron capture act) are taken into\naccount which are able to escape an infinite plane-parallel plate of the converter. The ratio of\nthe number of electrons escaped from the foil to that of the incident ones is referred to as the\nefficiency of the converter.\nConventionally we divide a foil into more thin layers. For each elementary layer we count\nthe probability of absorption of neutrons with the fixed energy. Efficiency of the converter will be\ndetermined by the sum of probabilities of neutron absorption and probability of the electron\nescape from the converter. In order to calculate the electron escape we have chosen a simple\ngeometrical model. The choice of the model is made from the following assumptions: all\nelectron emissions are isotropic, the length of path for any fixed energy of electrons (Rei) is\nconstant (fluctuation of power losses in the end of path is neglected). Then the density of\nprobability to find electrons in the substance forms a sphere with the radius equal to Rei (for any\nfixed energy). If the center of the sphere is crossed by the plane, two identical hemispheres are\nformed, which correspond to the electron escape to the forward and backward hemisphere, thus\nthe area of hemispheres could be considered as the probability of an electron output. In this\ncase total probability is 100 %, and escape to the one of hemispheres is 50 %. If we begin to\ncross a sphere with a step much less than Rei, segments will be formed whose area will be\nequal to the probability of electron escape. The step of iterations should be at least 100 times\nless than Rei, and then the electron absorption under the big corners could be neglected. The\n\n\farea of a segment and therefore the probability of electron escape becomes equal to zero in the\nintersection of a sphere by the plane at the distance Rei. The sum of probabilities of electron\nescapes for all energies, taking into account their weight contributions will determine the total\nelectron escape probability.\nIn our calculations, the probability of neutron absorption for each elementary layer, as a\nresult of reaction of inelastic interaction (n, \u03b3 ), is determined, using database for fixed neutron\nenergies. Both the probability of electron emission and probability of their escape from the body\nof the converter were calculated as well.\nResults of calculations of neutron absorption in converters made from natural gadolinium\nand its 157 isotope are shown in Fig. 5. Figure shows that at 30 microns thickness of the natural\ngadolinium converter there takes place a full absorption of neutrons with the wave length f 1.8\n\u0410\u041e. For its 157 isotope for neutrons with the wave lengths f 1.8 \u0410\u041e the same absorption\nhappens at 8 microns thickness of the converter.\nIn order to detect cold neutrons by the 157Gd converters we could limit ourselves by the\nthickness of 10 microns of the converter, if there no technological restrictions. It should be taken\ninto account that ranges of the majority of electrons emitted in the reaction of radiating capture\nof neutrons do not exceed 5 microns. If we use natural gadolinium converter the situation is little\nbit more complex, since low absorbing ability results in the necessity to use of more thick (up to\n20-40 micron) converters.\nObtained data on effectiveness and optimal thicknesses of converters for natural\ngadolinium and its 157 isotopes (see table 5 and 6 respectively).\n\nTable 5\n\nEfficiency E and optimal thickness T ( \u03bc m)\n\n\u03bb (A )\n0\n\nForward\n\nbackward\n\ntotal\n\n1\n\n0.080 (16)\n\n0.107 (30)\n\n0.180 (22)\n\n1.8\n\n0.145 (9)\n\n0.205 (19)\n\n0.328 (12)\n\n3\n\n0.169 (6)\n\n0.232 (13)\n\n0.388 (9)\n\n4\n\n0.190 (4)\n\n0.254 (12)\n\n0.415 (8)\nTable 6\n\n\fEfficiency E and optimal thickness T ( \u03bc m)\n\n\u03bb (A0)\nForward\n\nbackward\n\ntotal\n\n1\n\n0.170 (5)\n\n0.244 (14)\n\n0.400 (8)\n\n1.8\n\n0.265 (3)\n\n0.319 (6)\n\n0.569 (4)\n\n3\n\n0.293 (3)\n\n0.336 (5)\n\n0.611 (3)\n\n4\n\n0.305 (2)\n\n0.341 (4)\n\n0.633 (2)\n\nFig. 6 and 7 shows the dependence of registration efficiency on converter thickness for\nneutrons with the different energies.\nOur obtained results of calculations are compared with the experimental data presented in\npaper [18]. In this paper experimental data on the detection efficiency was measured in\nbackward direction for six different energies and compared to a calibrated 3He counter.\nEnriched up to 90.5%\n\n157\n\nGd converter was used. Works were performed in the reactors of\n\nAtominstitut in Vienna (ATI) and the ILL Grenoble.\nThe results of comparison are shown in the Fig. 8. For natural gadolinium our results\ncoincide with the experimental data well enough, in the limits of errors. Errors of calculations are\ncaused both by the precision of determining of gamma-quanta output (see Table 2) and by\ndetermining of neutron cross-section. This good consent testifies the correct choice of our\nmodels and performed calculations.\nFor the converter made of 157 isotope of Gd the experimental curve lays little bit higher.\nOur data are in good agreement with the theoretical limit, determined by the coefficients of\ninternal conversion, which makes no more than 65 % for an isotropic electron escapes, i.e. no\nmore than 32.5 % for the escape to one of hemispheres. If we take into account Auger\nelectrons, which could also escape in other directions with respect to internal conversion\nelectrons, the efficiency of the converter, could be improved by 4%, i.e. theoretical limit is 36.5\n% for the electron escapes to the backward direction.\n\n\f3. Conclusion.\n\nModel calculations of the efficiency of registration of thermal neutrons by foil converters\nmade of natural gadolinium and its 157 isotope are carried out. Processes of neutron absorption\nin the substance of converter and the probability of secondary electron escapes were examined.\nCalculations are performed for converters with the various thicknesses. We have chosen the\nmost optimal converter thicknesses, both from natural gadolinium and its 157 isotope. While\nusing converters from natural gadolinium it is possible to obtain total effectiveness of 18, 32, 38,\n42%, respectively for the neutrons with the wavelengths of 1, 1.8, 3 and 4 A0 for the converter\nthickness of 22, 12, 9, 8 microns. For the converters made of 157 isotope it is possible to reach\ntotal effectiveness of registration up to 40, 57, 61, 63% for the neutrons with the wavelengths 1,\n1.8, 3 and 4 A0 with the thickness of converter 8, 4, 3, 2 microns. Obtained results of calculation\nare compared with the experimental data. Our data for natural gadolinium in the limits of errors\ncoincide with the experimental [18] data, which testifies the correctness of chosen models and\nalgorithms of calculations. For the converters made of\n\n157\n\nGd our data are little bit lower, but\n\nnevertheless they do not exceed the maximal possible values.\nThis work has been accomplished under the Project T-1157 of the International Science\nand Technology Center.\nLiterature:\n[1]\n\nP.
