While it is well-known that the averaged induction equation for the mean magnetic field admits\nself-excited solutions for a turbulent flow with helicity, analogous solutions to the averaged vorticity equation only exist\nin the compressible case [1, 2]. An exception is the case of\nflows that are driven by a non-Galilean invariant forcing function, which can give rise to the so-called anisotropic kinetic\nalpha effect [3, 4, 5, 6]. This effect produces mean flows that\nare helical and of Beltrami type. Another example of mean\nflow generation is the \u039b effect [7, 8], whereby large-scale nonuniform flows can be produced in rotating anisotropic turbulence.\nIn the last few years another example has emerged, where\nthe analogy between vorticity and induction equations is more\nstriking. This example applies to the case of shear-flow turbulence. In fact, it has been argued that large-scale magnetic\nfield generation is possible via the shear\u2013current effect that results from non-vanishing off-diagonal components of the turbulent magnetic diffusivity tensor [9, 10]. This effect predicts\nlarge-scale field generation in homogeneous shear-flow turbulence with non-helical driving, which has indeed been seen in\nseveral simulations [11, 12, 13]. However, there is the problem that, according to the test-field method, the sign of the\nrelevant component of the turbulent magnetic diffusivity ten-\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: petri.kapyla@helsinki.fi\naddress: dhruba.mitra@gmail.com\n\u2021 Electronic address: brandenb@nordita.org\n\u2020 Electronic\n\nsor was found to be incompatible with that required for the\nshear\u2013current dynamo [12]. On the other hand, the analogous\nhydrodynamic effect has not yet been explored in sufficient\ndetail. This effect may explain the generation of large-scale\nvorticity in homogeneous shear-flow turbulence and was first\nstudied analytically in a seminal paper by Elperin, Kleeorin,\nand Rogachevskii [14]. Several recent studies discuss numerical evidence for the spontaneous formation of mean vorticity\n[11, 12, 13]. In those papers the main objective is to study\nthe generation of large-scale magnetic fields by shear-flow turbulence, while the simultaneous generation of mean vorticity\nwas merely an additional (but interesting) complication. On\nthe other hand, in view of the disappointing experience when\ntrying to verify the operation of the shear\u2013current dynamo using the test-field method, one should be careful in view of\nearlier negative results [15] concerning both the shear\u2013current\neffect and the mean-vorticity dynamo effect. The aim of this\npaper is therefore to discuss turbulent shear flow simulations\nwithout magnetic fields in order to demonstrate the existence\nof the mean-vorticity dynamo and to analyze its connection\nwith the eddy viscosity tensor in more detail.\nFollowing earlier work [11, 12, 13], periodic boundary conditions are used in the streamwise direction and in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the shear, while shearingperiodic boundary conditions are used in the cross-stream direction. This means that mass and mean momentum are conserved. Furthermore, if a large-scale flow emerges, it will also\nbe periodic corresponding to a simple sine wave. The mean\nvorticity is therefore also a long-wavelength sine wave. However, although the original analysis was based on mean vorticity, we discuss in the following mainly the mean velocity,\nbecause the corresponding equations are simpler and more intuitive.\nFor a proper analysis of the hydrodynamic mean-vorticity\n\n\f2\ndynamo effect one would need to proceed analogously to the\nhydromagnetic case where it was possible to determine all relevant components of the turbulent magnetic diffusivity tensor using the test-field method. One would then need to determine all relevant components of the eddy viscosity tensor.\nHowever, in the absence of a properly developed \"test-flow\"\nmethod for hydrodynamics, we must resort to more primitive\nmeasures for estimating components of the eddy viscosity tensor. Using decay calculations of a large-scale velocity structure, it was found that eddy viscosity, \u03bdt , and turbulent magnetic diffusivity, \u03b7t , are approximately equal, i.e. \u03bdt \u2248 \u03b7t , and\naround (0.8...0.9) \u00d7 urms /kf [16]. Here, kf is the wavenumber corresponding to the scale of the energy-carrying eddies\nand urms is the rms velocity of the turbulence. On the other\nhand, a more accurate determination of \u03b7t led recently to the\n\u03b7t = \u03b7t0 \u2261 urms /(3kf ), where \u03b7t0 is just a reference value.\nIn this paper we use an analogously defined reference value,\n\u03bdt0 \u2261 urms /(3kf ), but note that there is no strong case for\nassuming that \u03bdt will be close to \u03bdt0 .\nII.\n\nTHE MODEL\n\nIn the present work we consider weakly compressible subsonic turbulence in the presence of a linear shear flow,\nS\n\nU = (0, Sx, 0),\n\n(1)\n\nso x is the cross-stream direction, y is the streamwise direction, and z is the direction perpendicular to the plane of the\nshear flow. Since the effect of temperature changes is not important in this context, we consider an isothermal equation of\nstate. In the following we work with the departures from this\nS\nmean flow, so the total velocity is U + U , and the governing\nequations for U are then [12]\nDU\n= \u2212SUx\u0177 \u2212 c2s \u2207 ln \u03c1 + f + F visc ,\nDt\n\n(2)\n\nD ln \u03c1\n= \u2212\u2207 * U ,\nDt\n\n(3)\n\nS\n\nwhere D/Dt = \u2202/\u2202t + (U + U ) * \u2207 is the advective derivative with respect to the total velocity, cs is the isothermal\nsound speed, here considered as constant, \u03c1 is the mass density, f is a random forcing function, F visc = \u03c1\u22121 \u2207 * 2\u03c1\u03bdS\nis the viscous force, and Sij = 12 (Ui,j + Uj,i ) \u2212 13 \u03b4ij \u2207 * U\nis the traceless rate of strain tensor and commas denote partial\nderivatives.\nThe forcing function is \u03b4-correlated in time and consists\nof random plane waves with wavevectors k in the interval\n4.5 \u2264 k/k1 \u2264 5.5 [17]. During each time step, f is a single transverse (solenoidal) plane wave proportional to k \u00d7 e,\nwhere the wavevector k is taken randomly from a set of predefined vectors with components that are integer multiples of\n2\u03c0/L and whose moduli are in a certain interval around an average value, h|k|i, which we denote by kf , and e is an arbitrary\nrandom unit vector not aligned with k. The corresponding\n\nscale, 2\u03c0/kf , is referred to as the energy-carrying scale of the\nturbulence. Moreover, the time dependence of f is designed\nto mimic \u03b4-correlation, which is a simple and commonly used\nform of random driving [17].\nThere are two important dimensionless control parameters,\nthe Reynolds number Re and the shear parameter Sh,\nRe = urms /(\u03bdkf ),\n\nSh = S/(urms kf ),\n\n(4)\n\nthat quantify the intensity of turbulence and shear, respectively. We note that the values of Re and Sh cannot be chosen\na priori due to the strong effect that the vorticity dynamo has\non the value of urms in the saturated state. Thus we always\nrefer to values of urms , Re ,and Sh that apply to the situation\nwhere the vorticity dynamo is absent, i.e. early stages of the\nrun or a non-shearing simulation. The ratio of the size of the\ndomain, L, to the size of the energy-carrying scale is also an\nimportant control parameter that we call the scale separation\nratio, written here as kf L/2\u03c0 = kf /k1 , where k1 = 2\u03c0/L is\nthe smallest wavenumber that fits into the domain.\nWe employ the P ENCIL C ODE [18] with sixth-order finite\ndifferences in space and a third order time stepping scheme.\nWe use triply-periodic boundary conditions, except that the x\ndirection is shearing\u2013periodic, i.e.\nU (\u2212 21 Lx , y, z, t) = U ( 12 Lx , y + Lx St, z, t).\n\n(5)\n\nThis condition is routinely used in numerical studies of shear\nflows in Cartesian geometry [19, 20].\n\nIII. RESULTS\n\nThe initial velocity is zero, but the volume forcing drives a\nrandom flow that soon develops a turbulent cascade where the\nspectral energy follows an approximate k \u22125/3 inertial range\nbetween the forcing wavenumber kf and some dissipation\nwavenumber kd = hS2 /\u03bd 2 i1/4 .\nIn Fig. 1 we show images of the streamwise component of\nU at the periphery of the computational domain from a run\nwith Re \u2248 100 and Sh \u2248 \u22120.2 (hereafter Run A). At early\ntimes the velocity pattern is dominated by structures whose\nscale is comparable with the forcing scale, which is about one\nfifth of the domain size. However, at later times there is a tendency to produce large-scale flow patterns with a long wavelength variation in the z direction. This flow pattern tends to\nbe unstable and keeps disappearing and reappearing. This is\nseen also for other runs with smaller Reynolds number.\nGiven the systematic variation in the z direction, it is useful\nto consider averages over the x and y directions, denoted in\nthe following by overbars. So, U = U (z, t) depends only on\nz and t. Figure 2 shows U x and U y as functions of time and\nz. In Fig. 3 we plot the z dependence of U x and U y at a time\nnear the maximum vorticity. Note that the amplitude of U y\nis about 4 times as big as that of U x , and that the two fields\nare essentially in phase. The fact that U x and U y are in phase\nis an immediate consequence of the fact that S < 0, and that\nthere is a minus sign in front of S in Eq. (2).\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) Representation of Uy on the periphery of the computational domain for Run A at six different times showing the\noccasional generation of large scale flow patterns with a systematic variation in the z direction. Dark (blue) shades refer to negative values of\nUy while light (yellow) shades refer to positive values. Note that at time tcs k1 = 900 (corresponding to turms kf \u2248 480) the orientation of the\nflow pattern in the z direction is reversed compared to the previous event at tcs k1 = 600 (corresponding to turms kf \u2248 300).\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) U x (a) and U y (b) as functions of time and z\nfor Run A.\nFIG. 3: Four times U x (solid line) and U y (dashed) from Run A at\nt = 500(cs k1 )\u22121 .\n\nIn Run A with 5123 meshpoints there is one particularly\npronounced event during the time interval 200 < turms kf <\n\u2032\n400, where U y reaches an extremum at turms kf \u2248 280, fol\u2032\nUx\n\nlowed by an extremum of\na bit later at turms kf \u2248 300;\nsee Fig. 4 for their root mean square values.

This fact has been of some significance in previous studies of hydromagnetic dynamo action from turbulent shear flows [11, 13, 21], because, depending on the value\nof the sound speed, this can lead to numerical difficulties if\nthe Mach number exceeds unity during these strong enhancements of Urms . These difficulties are here avoided by choosing a smaller shear parameter Sh, regulated by the input parameter S.\nThe effect of increasing S is demonstrated in Fig. 5, which\nshows the rms values of the large-scale velocities for four runs\nwhere S is varied while the other parameters are kept constant.\nThe amount of shear is here quantified by the value of Sh,\nwhich is based on the urms value from a run without shear and\nthus effectively quantifies the strength of the random forcing.\nThese runs are denoted by the letters B to E, with the strength\nof the shear increasing from Sh = \u22120.08 in Run B to Sh =\n\u22120.33 in Run E. The bottom panel of Fig. 5 shows that Urms\nincreases almost in proportion to the shear for \u2212Sh > 0.25.\nThe flow in the large Sh runs is also highly fluctuating during\nperiods of vigorous vorticity generation, see Fig. 6 for a spacetime diagram of the large-scale velocities from Run E. Even in\nthe lowest shear run (Run B with Sh \u2248 \u22120.08), which is very\nsimilar to the non-shearing case during most of its evolution, a\nweak large-scale pattern is discernible at times, see times after\nturms kf > 600 in Fig. 7.\n\nFIG. 5: Root mean square values of U x (a) and U y (b), and Urms\n(c) for Runs B to E with different shear as indicated in the legend\nin panel (a).

(7) over z, we have\n\u2032\n\nRi + \u03bdij U j \u2261 const.\n\n(9)\n\nGiven that R and U can be obtained from the simulations,\nwe can then find all four components of \u03bdij by considering\nmoment equations of the form\n\u2032\n\nhRi U k i + \u03bdij Mjk = 0,\n\nFIG. 6: (Color online) U x (a) and U y (b) as functions of time and z\nfor Run E with Sh \u2248 \u22120.33.\n\nFIG. 7: (Color online) U x (a) and U y (b) as functions of time and z\nfor Run B with Sh \u2248 \u22120.08.\n\nthe initial condition. Thus, only the x and y components of U\nare non-vanishing. Therefore, U * \u2207U = 0. Furthermore, the\npressure gradient term does not enter in Eq. (6), because any\nhorizontally averaged gradient term can only have a z component. Using mean field theory [14], F can be expressed in\nterms of derivatives of the mean flow. In the present case of\none-dimensional mean fields this relationship reduces to\nFi =\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\u03bdij U j ,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u03bdij is the eddy viscosity tensor. We also assume incompressibility of the small-scale velocity field, \u2207 * u = 0,\nwhich is a good approximation for small Mach numbers, and\nrecall that horizontal averages depend only on z, i.e. the j = 3\ncoordinate. Therefore we have\n\u2032\n\nF i = \u2212\u22073 ui u3 = \u2212Ri .\n\n(8)\n\nHere we have denoted the two relevant components of the\nReynolds stress tensor by Ri \u2261 ui u3 , where i = 1, 2 refer\n\n(10)\n\nwhere we have introduced the correlation matrix Mjk =\n\u2032 \u2032\nhU j U k i. We have also assumed that \u03bdij is independent of\nz, and that, owing to periodic boundary conditions, the mean\nflow and its z derivatives have zero volume average, i.e.\n\u2032\nhU i i = 0 for any i. The components of \u03bdij can then be written\nas\n!\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2032\nhRi U 1 i\n\u03bdi1\n\u22121\n,\n(11)\n= \u2212M\n\u2032\n\u03bdi2\nhRi U 2 i\nwhere i = 1 or 2.\n\u2032\nIt turns out that the components of the correlations hR1 U j i\nare small compared with those of Mjk . This makes the evaluation of the components of \u03bd1j using Eq. (11) ill-behaved\n(see Fig. 8). This procedure does, however, yield reasonable\nresults for the \u03bd2i components: \u03bd21 is highly fluctuating, but\nwith an average of the order of roughly half of the reference\nvalue \u03bdt0 \u2261 31 urms kf\u22121 , whereas \u03bd22 is positive and between\none and two times \u03bdt0 in the quiescent phases of the simulation and peaking at roughly 5\u03bdt0 when the vorticity peaks.\nThe definition of \u03bdt0 is analogous to a corresponding reference\nvalue for the magnetic diffusivity [23], but it is not clear that\n\u03bdt should be exactly equal to \u03bdt0 in any limit. Instead, according to the first order smoothing approximation, \u03bdt = 0.4\u03bdt0\n[16], and hence the magnetic Prandtl number was expected to\nbe 0.4.\n\u2032\nIf both components of hR1 U k i for k = 1 and 2 were exactly zero, we could calculate \u03bd12 /\u03bd11 in terms of the ratios\n\u03bd12\nM1k\n=\u2212\n\u03bd11\nM2k\n\n(12)\n\nfor k = 1 and 2. Yet another possibility is to take the geometric mean of the two expressions, so\n\u03bd12\n\u2248\u2212\n\u03bd11\n\n\u0012\n\nM11 M12\nM21 M22\n\n\u00131/2\n\n\u2261\u2212\n\n\u0012\n\nM11\nM22\n\n\u00131/2\n\n,\n\n(13)\n\nwhere we have used the fact that M21 = M12 . The results\nshown in Fig. 9 indicate that the two ratios in Eq. (12) give\nconsistently negative values, although their moduli are different. Assuming that \u03bd11 is positive, which is reasonable, this\nresult suggests that a negative \u03bd12 is present in the system with\na modulus that is between 0.2 and 0.4 times the \u03bd11 component.\nFinally, a completely different approach for obtaining estimates between the components of \u03bdij is to use the resulting\n\n\f6\n\nFIG. 8: Components of the eddy viscosity tensor as obtained from\nEq. (11) normalized by \u03bdt0 = 13 urms kf\u22121 for Run A. Note that the\naverage value of \u03bd21 is negative (see the dashed line in the third panel\nfor turms kf > 100).\n\nmean-field equations, Eq. (6), and apply them to a hypothetical steady state. These equations are linear, which is a consequence of assuming the components of \u03bdij to be constant. In\nthat case we can Fourier transform and obtain the two equations\n(\u03bd + \u03bd11 )k 2 \u00db1 + \u03bd12 k 2 \u00db2 = 0,\n\n(14)\n\n(S + \u03bd21 k 2 )\u00db1 + (\u03bd + \u03bd22 )k 2 \u00db2 = 0,\n\n(15)\n\nwhere \u00db1 and \u00db2 are the Fourier amplitudes of the x and y\ncomponents of the mean flow. Since these equations are linear, they cannot describe nonlinear saturation of a mean-field\nvorticity dynamo instability. However, it is plausible that the\nassumption of constancy of the components \u03bdij breaks down\nwhen the resulting mean vorticity has become large enough.\nThe resulting modifications of \u03bdij may then explain saturation.\nEquations (14) and (15) show that a necessary condition for\nthe mean-vorticity dynamo to be excited is that the product\n\u03bd12 S is positive. This is indeed the case; in our case both\n\u03bd12 and S are negative. A sufficient condition for the meanvorticity dynamo to be excited is that the parameter\n\u0003 2\n\u0002\n\u2265 1,\n(16)\nD \u2261 \u03bd12 (S/k 2 + \u03bd21 ) + \u01eb2 /\u03bdT\nwhere \u03bdT = \u03bd + \u03bdt with\n\u03bdt =\n\n1\n2 (\u03bd11\n\n+ \u03bd22 ),\n\n\u01eb=\n\n1\n2 (\u03bd11\n\n\u2212 \u03bd22 ).\n\n(17)\n\nThe parameter D plays the role of a mean-vorticity dynamo\nnumber.

However, there is at least one other component\nthat does not enter Eq. (6), but that can also be used to determine the eddy viscosity (see, e.g. [24]). This component is not\ndriven by the derivatives of U , but by the imposed shear flow,\nS\n\u2207x U y , itself. Indeed, one expects that this imposed shear\nleads to an xy stress\n\u0010\n\u0011\nS\nS\nux uy = \u2212\u03bdt \u2207x U y + \u2207y U x = \u2212\u03bdt S.\n\n(21)\n\nThis is indeed the case; see Fig. 11. It turns out that the \u03bdt determined in this way is rather similar to the value of \u03bd22 estimated from Eq. (20). Again, there is no good reason that these\nvalues are the same, because the eddy viscosity obtained from\nEq. (21) belongs to a different component of the full rank-4\neddy viscosity tensor and is not part of the rank-2 tensor considered above.\n\nThe present work has demonstrated quite clearly that in\nnon-helical shear-flow turbulence a large-scale flow pattern\nemerges spontaneously. In the present case, where in the absence of shear the turbulence saturates at a Mach number of\norder 0.01, the large-scale flow becomes exceedingly strong\nand saturates at a Mach number of 0.1\u20130.2. This behavior is\nseen both at small and at the largest Reynolds numbers considered here (Re = 100, based on the inverse forcing wavenumber).\nThe flow pattern can be particularly well pronounced at certain times and shows a long wavelength variation in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the shear flow (here the\nz direction). For negative shear, the x and y components of\nthe shear flow are in phase in a way that is compatible with\nan interpretation in terms of a large-scale vorticity dynamo,\nas explored first by Elperin, Kleeorin, and Rogachevskii [14].\nThis means that the large-scale flow is driven by an anisotropic\neddy viscosity tensor. Particularly important is its xy component, \u03bdxy , which describes the production of a cross-stream\nlarge-scale flow component, U x (z, t), from a z-variation of\nthe streamwise large-scale flow, U y (z, t). The mean-vorticity\n\"dynamo cycle\" is completed by a suitable action of the shear\nitself, which produces a streamwise large-scale flow component, U y , from the cross-stream component, U x , by the term\nS\n\n\u2212U * \u2207U .\nThe mean-vorticity dynamo cycle can only work if the sign\nS\nof \u03bdxy is the same as that of the shear, \u2207x U y . The present\ninvestigations suggest that this is indeed the case. However, it\nis desirable to verify the sign of \u03bdxy using a test-flow method\nanalogously to the test-field method used in magnetohydrodynamics. Some care in using the correlation method is in\norder, because there are examples in magnetohydrodynamics\nwhere the correlation method give incorrect values for some\ncomponents of the magnetic diffusion tensor, although other\ncomponents were correct [25]. For example, when we apply\n\n\f8\na method analogous to that in Eq. (18) to the magnetic field\nof a simulation of shear flow turbulence (see, e.g., Figs. 7 or\n8 of Ref. [12]), the components of the magnetic field scatter almost isotropically about the origin. This is compatible\nwith an interpretation in terms of an incoherent alpha\u2013shear\neffect [12, 26]. On the other hand, there is still a weak correlation with a negative slope. This would suggest that the\nshear\u2013current dynamo might also be at work, even though the\ntest-field method indicates that this should not be the case.\nClearly, the reality of the large-scale flow found in simulations is more complicated than what is suggested by the simple mean-vorticity dynamo problem. Firstly, in contrast to the\nmagnetic dynamo no kinematic stage can be distinguished, i.e.\nthe large-scale patterns are visible only after they are already\nof dynamical importance. Secondly, the mean flow can reverse sign in random intervals which is not anticipated from\nthe linear mean-vorticity dynamo model with anisotropic eddy\nviscosity, where self-excited solutions would always be nonoscillatory. Another question that needs to be addressed in\nfuture work is the saturation level of the large-scale flow, its\nrelation to the saturation level of the small-scale flow, and a\npossible dependence on the Mach number.\nFor more realistic applications it will be important to get\ninformation about the full eddy viscosity, which is a rank-4\ntensor [8]. In the present work, where the averages are only\n\none-dimensional, the eddy viscosity reduces to a rank-2 tensor. Finally, for astrophysical applications it should be pointed\nout that the gas in many shear flows is ionized and electrically conducting, giving rise to efficient dynamo action. The\nresulting mean Lorentz force from the small-scale magnetic\nfield modifies the eddy viscosity in a way that suppresses the\nmean-vorticity dynamo. Details of this need to be investigated\nfurther. Another effect that can suppress the mean-vorticity\ndynamo is rotation [13]. This can be understood from the dispersion relation in that the addition of rotation leads, among\nother terms, to a \u22124\u03a92 term inside the squared brackets of\nEq. (16) that always suppresses the mean-vorticity dynamo.\n\n[1] Moiseev, S. S., Sagdeev, R. Z., Tur A. V., Khomenko, G. A., &\nYanovskii, V. V., Sov. Phys. JETP 58, 1149 (1983).\n[2] Kitchatinov, L.
