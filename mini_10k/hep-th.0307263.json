Since the approach\nis based on a sum over space-time histories, it is perturbatively non-renormalizable\neven in three dimensions. By mapping the three-dimensional theory to a two-matrix\nmodel with ABAB interaction we show that both the cosmological and the (perturbatively) non-renormalizable gravitational coupling constant undergo additive\nrenormalizations consistent with canonical quantization.\n\n1\n\n\fIntroduction\nDefining a theory of quantum gravity as a suitable sum over space-time histories is an\nappealing proposition, since it can in principle be done in a completely backgroundindependent and non-perturbative way, with the structure of space-time being determined dynamically. In two space-time dimensions, such a program can be carried\nout successfully, although in this case \u2013 because of the absence of propagating gravitons \u2013 it may be more appropriate to talk about a theory of \"quantum geometry\"\nrather than one of quantum gravity. A well-known example is the non-perturbative\nlattice formulation of 2d (Euclidean) gravity which reproduces quantum Liouville\ntheory in the limit of vanishing lattice spacing [1, 2, 3]. Attempts to use similar\ncombinatorial and matrix-model techniques to extract information about the nonperturbative structure of higher-dimensional gravity have until recently met with\nlittle success. However, if one performs the sum over geometries over space-times\nof Lorentzian (as opposed to Riemannian) signature, matrix-model methods can be\napplied profitably in the non-perturbative quantization of three-dimensional quantum gravity, as was first shown in [4]. This line of investigation will be pursued\nfurther in the present work.\nQuantum gravity in three space-time dimensions represents an interesting case in\nbetween dimensions two and four. On the one hand, it contains no propagating gravitational degrees of freedom and can be reduced classically to a finite-dimensional\nphysical phase space, both in a metric [5] and a connection (Chern-Simons) formulation [6].1 Nevertheless, the unreduced theory in terms of the metric g\u03bc\u03bd appears to be\nnon-renormalizable when one tries to expand around a fixed background geometry,\njust as in four dimensions. A definition of three-dimensional quantum gravity via a\n\"sum over geometries\" therefore seems to require a genuinely non-perturbative construction, and in turn may shed light on the problem of non-renormalizability of the\nfull, four-dimensional theory, where an explicit classical reduction is not available.\nA non-perturbative definition of the sum over geometries in three- and fourdimensional quantum gravity was proposed in [7, 8]. Unlike previous approaches,\nthis method of \"Lorentzian dynamical triangulations\" or \"Lorentzian simplicial\nquantum gravity\" uses space-time geometries with physical, Lorentzian signature,\nrather than positive-definite Riemannian geometries as a fundamental input. Details\non the classes of geometries included in the path sum and on earlier two-dimensional\nwork that provided the motivation for this approach can be found in [9, 8, 10]. In\nview of the recent observational progress in cosmology (see [11] for a recent review)\nwe should point out that the physical, renormalized cosmological constant in all of\nthese models is necessarily positive.\nIn this paper, we will present an explicit analysis of the renormalization behaviour\nof the 3d Lorentzian model, using a matrix-model formulation. This follows previous\n1\n\nWhether and to what extent the associated quantum theories are related is still a contentious\nissue.\n\n2\n\n\f(4,1)\n\nt+1\n\nt\n(1,4)\n\n(2,2)\n\nFigure 1: The fundamental building blocks of 3d Lorentzian quantum gravity interpolate between adjacent spatial slices of integer times t and t+1, and are labelled\naccording to the numbers (it , it+1 ) of their vertices lying in the two slices.\nwork which analyzed the phase structure of three-dimensional quantum gravity (for\nspherical spatial topology) with the help of computer simulations [12, 13, 14], and\na demonstration [4] that 3d Lorentzian dynamical triangulations can be mapped to\ngraph configurations generated by the so-called ABAB-matrix model [15].\nWithin continuum approaches to quantum gravity there have also been attempts\nto prove the non-perturbative renormalizability of gravity beyond dimension two,\nstarting with an analysis of the theory in 2+\u01eb dimensions [16, 17, 18]. More recently,\nan effective average action approach has produced evidence of a non-trivial fixed\npoint through an analysis of renormalization group flow equations [19, 20, 21].\n\nQuantum gravity and the ABAB-matrix model\nWe start out with a brief description of the three-dimensional Lorentzian simplicial\nspace-times appearing in the sum over geometries, and the construction of the partition function. In the standard formulation of the model, the spatial hypersurfaces\nof constant integer proper time t are given by two-dimensional equilateral triangulations, each corresponding to a unique piecewise flat 2d geometry. These are the\nsame geometries as appear in the construction of 2d Euclidean quantum gravity,\nwhich is known to be rather robust with regard to changes in both the types of\nbuilding blocks used and their gluing rules [22]. We exploited this universality in [4]\nby using 2d spatial geometries made up of equilateral squares instead of triangles,\nand accordingly changing the 3d building blocks from tetrahedra only to a set of\ntetrahedra and pyramids.\nAny two neighbouring spatial quadrangulations at times t and t+1 can be connected (in many inequivalent ways) by a three-dimensional \"sandwich\" geometry\nconstructed from these building blocks, as indicated in Fig.1. The square base of a\n\n3\n\n\fpyramid (or an upside-down pyramid) coincides with a square of the spatial slice at\ntime t (or t+1), whereas the tetrahedral building block is needed to connect between\nthe two types of pyramids within the same sandwich.\nThe amplitude for propagation from an initial quadrangulation g1 to a final one\ng2 in n proper-time steps is obtained by summing over all geometrically distinct ways\nof stacking n sandwich geometries \u2206t = 1 in between g1 and g2 , in such a way that\ntheir 2d boundary geometries match pairwise at integer times. The weight of each\ngeometry is given by a discretized version of the Einstein action, here conveniently\ntaken as the Regge action for piecewise linear geometries [23]. After Wick-rotating,\nthe partition function (or proper-time propagator) can be written as\nX\n1 \u2212S(T )\ne\n,\n(1)\nZ(\u03ba, \u03bb; g1, g2 , n) =\nC\nT\nT ,\u2202T =g \u222ag\n1\n\n2\n\nwhere CT is the order of the automorphism group of the (generalized) triangulation\nT , and the sum is over all T with fixed boundaries g1 and g2 of the kind just\ndescribed. The gravitational action, including a cosmological term, is given by\n\u0010\n\u0011 \u0010\n\u0011\n1\nS(T ) = \u2212\u03ba N14 (T )+N41 (T )\u2212N22 (T ) +\u03bb N14 (T )+N41 (T )+ N22 (T ) , (2)\n2\nwhere N41 (T ) and N14 (T ) count the numbers of pyramids and upside-down pyramids\nand N22 (T ) the number of tetrahedra contained in a given triangulation T . The\nsimplicity of the Regge action in our case stems from the fact that we use only\ntwo types of building blocks, and contributions to volumes and curvatures (in the\nform of deficit angles) occur only in terms of a few basic units (see [8, 4] for further\ndetails). The simplicial action contains two dimensionless coupling constants \u03ba and\n\u03bb, related to their continuum counterparts by2\n\u0011\na3 \u039b(0)\na \u0010\n\u22121 1\n\u221a ,\n,\n\u03bb\n=\n\u2212\n\u03c0\n+\n3\ncos\n(3)\n\u03ba=\n4\u03c0G(0)\n3\n24 2\u03c0\nwhere a is a geodesic lattice cut-off with the dimension of length. It should be emphasized that these are \"na\u0131\u0308ve\" relations between the dimensionless lattice coupling\nconstants and those of the continuum theory, which will not be valid in the quantum\ntheory. As we shall see in due course, additive renormalizations of both coupling\nconstants will be needed in that case.\nWe can rewrite the partition function (1) as\nX\nX 1\ne\u03ba(N14 (TN )+N41 (TN )\u2212N22 (TN )) ,\n(4)\nZ(\u03ba, \u03bb; g1 , g2, n) =\ne\u2212\u03bbN\nC\nTN\nN\nT\nN\n\nwhere the sum over the total space-time volume N = N14 + N41 + 12 N22 has been\npulled out, together with the accompanying Boltzmann weight e\u2212\u03bbN , and the remaining sum runs over all triangulations TN of fixed volume N, whose Boltzmann\n2\n\nNote\nour cosmological constant \u039b(0) is defined as the quantity that multiplies the volume\nR 3that\n\u221a\nterm d x g. More conventionally this term would be called \u039b(0) /(8\u03c0G(0) ).\n\n4\n\n\f\u03bb\n\u03bbc(\u03ba)\n(\u03ba,\u03bb)\na3\n\n(\u03ba0, \u03bb 0)\na\n\n\u03ba0\n\n\u03ba\n\nFigure 2: The phase diagram of 3d Lorentzian quantum gravity in the plane spanned\nby the bare inverse gravitational coupling \u03ba and the bare cosmological constant \u03bb,\ntogether with the canonical approach to a point (\u03ba0 , \u03bbc (\u03ba0 )) on the critical line.\nweights depend on the curvature term multiplying \u03ba. To leading order, the number\nof triangulations at fixed volume grows exponentially with the volume, leading to\nthe asymptotic behaviour\nf (N; g1 , g2 ) e\u03bbc (\u03ba)N ,\n(5)\nfor the second sum in (4), where f (N; g1 , g2) indicates subleading terms in N. It\nfollows immediately that for a given \u03ba the regularized quantum gravity model is\nonly well defined (that is, its state sum converges) for \u03bb > \u03bbc (\u03ba), corresponding to\nthe region above the critical line in the phase diagram of Fig. 2. The critical line\nlimits the region of convergence of the partition function Z. Taking \u03bb \u2192 \u03bbc (\u03ba) from\ninside this region of convergence, the average value of (suitable powers of) N will\ndiverge, corresponding to the limit of infinite lattice volume. Such a limit is clearly\nnecessary if a continuum limit in any conventional sense is to be achieved.\nThe continuum limit is obtained by scaling the lattice spacing a to zero while\nkeeping the continuum time T = n * a fixed (and therefore, increasing the number\nn of discrete time steps at a rate 1/a). Different, non-canonical scaling relations\nbetween T and a are in principle possible3 , but the computer simulations of [12]\nsupported the presence of canonical scaling in 3d quantum gravity. More precisely,\nwe expect to leading order in a a scaling of the form\na\n= \u03ba \u2212 \u03ba0 ,\nG\n\na3 \u039b = \u03bb(\u03ba) \u2212 \u03bbc (\u03ba),\n\n3\n\n(6)\n\nIn two-dimensional\nEuclidean quantum gravity the proper time T scales anomalously and one\n\u221a\nhas to keep n a fixed [24]. By contrast, the scaling in two-dimensional Lorentzian simplicial\nquantum gravity is canonical [9]. The relation between the two formulations is well understood\n[25].\n\n5\n\n\fas illustrated in Fig. 2. The approach to the critical line is governed by the dimensionless combination G3 \u039b which serves as the true, \"observable\" coupling constant\nof 3d quantum gravity. The physics underlying (6) is as follows: for a given value\nof the bare inverse gravitational coupling \u03ba the average discrete space-time volume\nhNi and its dimensionful counterpart hV i behave like\nhNi \u223c\n\n1\n\u03bb \u2212 \u03bbc (\u03ba)\n\nhV i := a3 hNi \u223c\n\n=\u21d2\n\na3\n,\n\u03bb \u2212 \u03bbc (\u03ba)\n\n(7)\n\nthat is, the number of building blocks diverges in the limit as \u03bb \u2192 \u03bbc (\u03ba). The\nphysical requirement that the continuum volume hV i remain finite and be proportional to the inverse renormalized cosmological constant 1/\u039b fixes the second scaling\nrelation in (6). The first relation is then determined by demanding that G3 \u039b be a\ndimensionless coupling constant of the theory. This is precisely achieved by approaching a given point (\u03ba0 , \u03bbc (\u03ba0 )) on the critical curve according to the canonical\nscaling assignment (6). Note in passing that there is no way of obtaining a renormalized cosmological coupling \u039b \u2264 0, in agreement with our earlier remarks. Also,\nwe choose the approach to the critical line such that the sign of the renormalized\nNewton constant is standard and positive.\nOur construction raises the question of whether or not physics depends on the\nchoice of \u03ba0 . Indications from the computer simulations of the model are that the\nfinal result is independent of the value of \u03ba0 in the range probed [12]. We will discuss\nin the following how this question can be addressed analytically.\nLet gt and gt+1 be two spatial quadrangulations at t and t+1, and hgt+1 |T\u0302 |gt i\nthe transition amplitude or proper-time propagator for the single time step from t\nto t + 1. By definition, T\u0302 is the transfer matrix in the sense of Euclidean lattice\ntheory, and can be shown to satisfy the usual properties of a transfer matrix [8].\nThe propagator for n time steps is obtained by an n-fold iteration,\nZ(\u03ba, \u03bb; g1, g2 , n) = hg2 |T\u0302 n |g1 i.\n\n(8)\n\nConsider now the matrix model of two hermitian M \u00d7 M-matrices with partition\nfunction\nZ\n2\n2 \u03b11 4 \u03b12 4 \u03b2\nZ(\u03b11 , \u03b12 , \u03b2) = dAdB e\u2212M tr (A +B \u2212 4 A \u2212 4 B \u2212 2 ABAB) .\n(9)\nIn the context of the large-M expansion the free energy F can be expressed as\n2\n\nM F (\u03b11 , \u03b12 , \u03b2) \u2261 \u2212 log Z(\u03b11 , \u03b12 , \u03b2) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nM \u03c7(h) Fh (\u03b11 , \u03b12 , \u03b2),\n\n(10)\n\nh=0\n\nwhere \u03c7(h) = 2 \u2212 2h is the Euler number of the quadrangulations dual to the fourvalent graphs generated by the matrix model. It was argued in [4] that the transfer\nmatrix for transitions between two spatial geometries gt and gt+1 of genus h is related\nto Fh (\u03b11 , \u03b12 , \u03b2) according to\nX\nX\ne\u2212zt Nt \u2212zt+1Nt+1\nhgt+1 (Nt+1 )|T\u0302 |gt (Nt )ih ,\n(11)\nFh (\u03b11 , \u03b12 , \u03b2) =\nNt ,Nt+1\n\ngt+1 (Nt+1 ),gt (Nt )\n\n6\n\n\fwhere Nt and Nt+1 denote the numbers of squares of the quadrangulations defining\nthe spatial geometries at times t and t + 1, both of Euler number \u03c7(h). Pulling\nout the double-sum over discrete boundary volumes is convenient when studying\nthe transfer matrix per se (see [9, 26] for an analogous procedure in two space-time\ndimensions). The two dimensionless boundary constants zt and zt+1 can be viewed\nas cosmological coupling constants for the boundary areas. For the purposes of the\npresent paper we will choose particular values for zt and zt+1 , in such a way that\nthe relations\n1\n(12)\n\u03b11 = \u03b12 = e\u03ba\u2212\u03bb ,\n\u03b2 = e\u2212( 2 \u03bb+\u03ba) ,\nhold between the matrix model coupling constants \u03b1i , \u03b2, and the bare gravitational\nand cosmological coupling constants 1/\u03ba and \u03bb of three-dimensional gravity. The\nrelations (12) were derived previously in [4], and we will use them in the next section\nto translate the canonical approach (6) to the matrix model and draw conclusions\nabout the renormalization behaviour of the theory.\nThe derivation of eq. (12) requires some explanation. Generic matrix elements\nof T\u0302 in (11) grow exponentially with the total discrete three-volume N = Nt+Nt+1+\nN22 /2, reflecting the fact that there are exponentially many three-geometries which\ninterpolate between two given two-geometries gt and gt+1 . This exponential growth\nis taken care of by the combined additive renormalizations of the cosmological and\ngravitational constants, as discussed earlier in this section.\nThere is a completely analogous entropy for the boundary two-geometries, since\nthe number of quadrangulations of a given topology and a given discrete two-volume\nNt grows exponentially with Nt . Just as in the case of the three-volume, this exponential growth can be cancelled by an additive renormalization, in this case of the\nboundary cosmological constant zt , leading to a renormalized boundary cosmological\nconstant multiplying a continuum area. Assume that the second sum in (11) grows\nlike ezc (Nt +Nt+1 ) to leading order in the boundary two-volumes, and renormalize zt\nand zt+1 canonically according to\nzt = zc + a2 Zt ,\n\nzt+1 = zc + a2 Zt+1 .\n\n(13)\n\nDefining the continuum area At of a quadrangulation of Nt squares by At := Nt a2 ,\nthe total area contribution in the exponential in (11) becomes\n(zc \u2212 zt )Nt + (zc \u2212 zt+1 )Nt+1 = \u2212(Zt At + Zt+1 At+1 ),\n\n(14)\n\nas anticipated. In this article, we set Zt = Zt+1 = 0, corresponding to zt = zt+1 = zc\nin (11), since we are only interested in the bulk coupling constants \u039b and G. This\nimplies the symmetry \u03b11 = \u03b12 , as well as the relation (12). From a technical point\nof view it means that we have to deal only with the symmetric ABAB-matrix model\nwhich, contrary to the asymmetric model, has been solved explicitly [15].\n\n7\n\n\f\u03b1\n\nA\n(\u03b2c ,\u03b1 c )\n\n(\u03b20,\u03b1 0 )\n\u03b1c(\u03b2)\n\n(\u03b2,\u03b1)\n\nB\n\ns=1\n\n\u03b2 (\u03ba, \u03bb c(\u03ba))\n\n\u03b2\n\n\u03b2(\u03ba 0 , \u03bb c(\u03ba0 ))\n\nFigure 3: The phase diagram of 3d Lorentzian quantum gravity in the plane spanned\nby the two coupling constants \u03b2 and \u03b1 of the matrix model, together with the\ncanonical approach to a point (\u03b20 , \u03b10 ) on the critical line. The end point (\u03b2c , \u03b1c = \u03b2c )\nof the diagonal s = 1 separates phase A from phase B.\n\nRenormalization of 3d gravity\nThe canonical approach (6) to a critical point (\u03ba0 , \u03bb0 ) on the critical line of the\n(\u03ba, \u03bb)-coupling constant plane, Fig.2, can be mapped via (12) to the (\u03b2, \u03b1)-plane, as\nshown in Fig.3. Let F (\u03b1, \u03b2) denote the free energy of the symmetric ABAB-matrix\nmodel, and set \u03b11 = \u03b12 \u2261 \u03b1. It is convenient to change variables from (\u03b2, \u03b1) to\n(s, r), where\np\n\u03b2\ns= ,\n(15)\nr = \u03b12 + \u03b2 2 .\n\u03b1\nThe upper right-hand quadrant of the \u03b1-\u03b2-plane corresponds to r, s \u2208 [0, \u221e]. Approaching a point (\u03b2c (s), \u03b1c (s)) on the critical line from below along\np a line segment\nof constant s, the coordinate r will vary between 0 and rc (s) = \u03b1c (s)2 + \u03b2c (s)2 .\nAccording to [15], F (\u03b1, \u03b2) or F (s, r) are analytic functions of their arguments below\nthe critical line. Moreover, approaching the critical line along s = const, F (r, s) has\nan expansion\nF (s, r) \u2212 F (s, rc (s)) = c1 (s)\u03b4r + c2 (s)\u03b4r 2 + c5/2 (s)\u03b4r 5/2 + c3 (s)\u03b4r 3 + * * *\n\n(16)\n\nin the vicinity of the critical point (s, rc (s)), where \u03b4r = rc (s) \u2212 r and where the\ncoefficients ci (s) are analytic functions of s for both 0 < s < 1 and 1 < s < \u221e.\nAround the special point (s, rc (s)) = (1, rc (1)) which separates the so-called A-phase\n(s < 1) from the B-phase (s > 1), the behaviour is more complicated than the one\n\n8\n\n\fgiven in (16). As discussed in [4], phase A is the one relevant for canonical quantum\ngravity and we will consider only coupling constant variations inside phase A.\nThe straight approach along s = const to the critical line underlying (16) is not\nthe one relevant for three-dimensional quantum gravity, since it would translate to a\ncurve in the (\u03ba, \u03bb)-plane which approaches the corresponding critical point (\u03ba0 , \u03bb0 )\nnon-tangentially. In the notation of (6), this would imply \u03ba \u2212 \u03ba0 \u221d \u03bb(\u03ba) \u2212 \u03bbc (\u03ba), in\ncontradiction with the scaling relations (6). Stated differently, insisting on canonical\ndimensions for G and \u039b and a finite \u039b, the gravitational coupling G would have to\ngo to infinity like 1/a2 when the cut-off is removed.\nOne can of course repeat the analysis of [15] for an arbitrary approach to the\ncritical line. However, rather than giving the technical details of this, let us just\nstate the final result for the case at hand. We can approach a critical point (\u03b20 , \u03b10 )\nalong any curve (\u03b2(a), \u03b1(a)), where for convenience we have identified the curve\nparameter a with the lattice cut-off. For the canonical gravitational interpretation\nto be valid, the scaling must follow (6), that is, both the tangent and the curvature\nof the curve (\u03b2(a), \u03b1(a)) must agree with those of the critical line (\u03b2c (s), \u03b1c (s)) at\nthe point (\u03b20 , \u03b10 ). The difference between the two curves will only appear in their\nthird-order derivatives, as indicated by Fig.3. In order to investigate the analyticity\nproperties of the free energy, we perform a decomposition\n\u0010\n\u0011 \u0010\n\u0011\nF (\u03b1(a), \u03b2(a)) \u2212 F (\u03b10 , \u03b20 ) = F (\u03b1, \u03b2) \u2212 F (\u03b1c , \u03b2c ) + F (\u03b1c , \u03b2c ) \u2212 F (\u03b10 , \u03b20 ) , (17)\nwhere, in the notation of Fig.3, the approaching curve (\u03ba(a), \u03bb(a)) translates into\n(\u03b2(a), \u03b1(a)), (\u03b2c , \u03b1c ) corresponds to the point (\u03ba, \u03bbc (\u03ba)), and (\u03b20 , \u03b10 ) to (\u03ba0 , \u03bb0 ) on\nthe critical line. To evaluate the first difference in (17) we can use\n\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b1c \u223c \u039ba3 + * * * ,\n\n\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b2c \u223c \u039ba3 + * * * ,\n\n(18)\n\nas well as the expansion (16). In the second difference we can use\n\u03b1c \u2212 \u03b10 \u223c \u2212a/G + * * * ,\n\n\u03b2c \u2212 \u03b20 \u223c \u2212a/G + * * * ,\n\n(19)\n\nwithout any reference to the renormalized cosmological constant \u039b, defined by (6).\nThis happens because both (\u03b20 , \u03b10 ) and (\u03b2c , \u03b1c ) lie on the critical line, whereas \u039b\nis a measure of the distance from the critical line. The important point is that \u2013 as\nlong as we stay in phase A \u2013 the difference F (\u03b1c , \u03b2c )\u2212F (\u03b10 , \u03b20 ) is entirely analytic\nin \u03b1c \u2212\u03b10 . We conclude that the non-analytic behaviour of the free energy occurs\nas a function of the cosmological coupling constant alone. This non-analyticity\nensures the existence of an infinite-volume limit of 3d quantum gravity in the sense\nof (7). The renormalized gravitational coupling constant G plays no role in taking\nthe continuum limit, which is entirely dictated by the non-analytic part of F (\u03b1, \u03b2).\nLet us discuss this behaviour in some more detail. The free energy F (\u03b1, \u03b2) of\nthe matrix model serves as the partition function of the sum over sandwich configurations of the three-dimensional Lorentzian gravity model, as described above. Its\n9\n\n\fcontinuum limit is associated with a limit where the number N of 3d building blocks\ndiverges, and a \u2192 0, while keeping the continuum three-volume V = Na3 finite.\nThis large-N behaviour is related to the expansion\nX\nN (N14 , N41 ; N22 ) \u03b1N14 +N41 \u03b2 N22 ,\n(20)\nF (\u03b1, \u03b2) =\nN14 ,N41 ,N22\n\nof F (\u03b1, \u03b2) into large powers of \u03b1 and \u03b2, where N (N14 , N41 ; N22 ) denotes the number\nof three-geometries constructed from (N14 , N41 , N22 ) building blocks between neighbouring spatial surfaces at t and t+1 (see [4] for details). The non-analytic part of\nF (\u03b1, \u03b2) is associated with simultaneous infinitely large powers of \u03b1 and \u03b2, which in\nturn is reflected in a finite radius of convergence of the power expansion.\nWe will denote the non-analytic part of F (\u03b1, \u03b2) by Fsingular (\u03b1, \u03b2), and it is only\nthis part that should be kept when discussing the continuum limit. Thus, returning\nto the expansion (16), the first two terms on the right-hand side are irrelevant to a\npotential continuum limit dictated by the non-analytic term (rc \u2212 r)5/2 . Likewise,\nthe term F (\u03b1c , \u03b2c )\u2212F (\u03b10 , \u03b20 ) in eq. (17) can be ignored when discussing continuum\nphysics. The term F (\u03b1, \u03b2)\u2212F (\u03b1c , \u03b2c ) in that relation is similar to the quantity (16)\nwhich characterizes the non-tangential approach to a critical point. The continuum\nexpression which survives is therefore\n\u0010\n\u00115/2\nFsingular (\u039b, G) \u223c \u039ba3\n.\n\n(21)\n\nOne would obtain the same expression in the 2d (Euclidean) quantum gravity interpretation given in [15], except that the power of the lattice cut-off would be\ndifferent. This is due to the tangential approach to the critical point in the present\ncase, reflecting the different physical properties of the higher-dimensional gravity\ntheory.\nOne should keep in mind that Fsingular is not identical with the partition function\n(4) for three-dimensional quantum gravity for n = 1, but rather is a particular sum of\nmatrix elements of the transfer matrix between two adjacent constant proper-time\nslices, which are separated by one lattice unit a. However, as was also argued in\n[4], the study of this sum is sufficient to exhibit the renormalization behaviour of\nthe bare gravitational and cosmological coupling constants.4 The only way in which\nthe (perturbatively) non-renormalizable gravitational coupling constant G makes\nan appearance in 3d Lorentzian quantum gravity is by fixing the approach to the\nchosen critical point \u03ba0 , and thereby defining the dimensionless quantity\n\u03bb \u2212 \u03bbc (\u03ba)\n= const. = \u039bG3 .\n(\u03ba \u2212 \u03ba0 )3\n\n(22)\n\n4\nIn an analogous analysis of two-dimensional simplicial Lorentzian quantum gravity one also\ncan deduce the renormalization of the cosmological constant from the study of the same restricted\ncombination of matrix elements.\n\n10\n\n\fConsequently, all observables we may think of calculating in this formulation will\nbe of the form\nO(\u039b, G) = \u039bdim/3 F (\u039bG3 )\n(23)\nafter the continuum limit has been performed, where \"dim\" refers to the mass dimension of the observable O.\n\nDiscussion\nThree-dimensional simplicial Lorentzian quantum gravity gives an explicit realization of the summation over three-geometries. As in all quantum theories with a\ncut-off, a prescription must be given of how to remove the cut-off and recover the\nunderlying continuum quantum field theory; we did this by specifying the renormalization of the bare coupling constants of the theory. The relation of the model\nto the ABAB-matrix model allowed us to give a detailed discussion of a possible\nrenormalization of the gravitational and cosmological coupling constants, consistent\nboth with the existence of an infinite-volume limit of the model and with a canonical\nscaling of the renormalized coupling constants.\nThe bare gravitational and the bare cosmological coupling constants turned out\nto be subject to additive renormalizations. The perturbative non-renormalizability\nof the gravitational coupling constant is resolved in this non-perturbative approach\nby the fact that the renormalized gravitational coupling constant only appears in\nthe particular combination (22), defined by the canonical approach to the critical\nline.\nOne way to obtain more detailed information about the continuum limit would\nbe by analyzing the full transfer matrix, instead of the contracted version we have\nstudied in the present work. From the transfer matrix one can extract the continuum\nproper-time Hamiltonian \u0124 by virtue of the relation\nT\u0302 = e\u2212a\u0124 \u2248 I\u02c6 \u2212 a\u0124.\n\n(24)\n\nThis can be done explicitly in both two-dimensional Lorentzian and Euclidean simplicial quantum gravity, where the Hamiltonian is a differential operator in a single\nvariable, the one-volume of the spatial universe. Three-dimensional quantum gravity\nis more involved since the spatial geometries at a fixed time constitute an infinitedimensional field space, spanned by the conformal factor and a finite number of\nTeichm\u00fcller parameters. However, from our knowledge of the classical, canonical\nstructure of the theory we do not expect the conformal part of the geometry to\nplay a dynamical role. From this point of view \u2013 in addition to any Teichm\u00fcller\nparameters \u2013 at most the constant mode of the conformal factor (equivalently, the\ntwo-dimensional total area) of the spatial geometry should appear in the Hamiltonian.\n11\n\n\fWe know that at the discretized level there are transitions between any pair\nof two-geometries of the same topology, that is, all matrix elements of T\u0302 are nonvanishing. It would be very interesting to understand in detail how the matrix\nelements lose their sensitivity to anything but the Teichm\u00fcller parameters and the\ntotal area in the continuum limit. Although the ABAB-matrix model cannot be used\nto address the issue of how the dependence of the transfer matrix on the conformal\nfactor drops out, solving its asymmetric version (with \u03b11 6= \u03b12 ) would determine\nthe dependence of the transfer matrix (and thus the quantum Hamiltonian) on the\narea of the spatial boundaries. We hope to return to this issue in the near future.\nAcknowledgment. All authors acknowledge support by the EU network on \"Discrete\nRandom Geometry\", grant HPRN-CT-1999-00161.
