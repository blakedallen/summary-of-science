Its goal is a measurement of the general relativistic gravitomagnetic\nLense-Thirring effect (Lense and Thirring 1918) due to the Earth's rotation at a repeatedly\nclaimed \u2243 1% level of accuracy in conjunction with the existing LAGEOS and LAGEOS II\nlaser-ranged satellites which fly at much higher altitudes, i.e. h \u2243 6000 km. The observable\nis a suitable linear combination of the longitudes of the ascending nodes \u03a9 of the three\nsatellites, because the gravitomagnetic field of the Earth induces a secular precession on\nsuch a Keplerian orbital element\n\u03a9\u0307LT =\n\n2GL\n,\n\u2212 e2 )3/2\n\n(1)\n\nc2 a3 (1\n\nwhere G is the Newtonian gravitational constant, L is the Earth's spin angular momentum,\nc is the speed of light in vacuum, a is the satellite's semi-major axis and e is its eccentricity.\nIn Table 1 we quote the Lense-Thirring precessions for LAGEOS, LAGEOS II and LARES:\ntheir magnitudes are of the order of 101 \u2212 102 milliarcseconds per year (mas yr\u22121 in the\nfollowing).\nThe much larger classical secular precessions induced on \u03a9 by the even zonal harmonic\n1\n\nSee on the WEB http://www.asi.it/SiteEN/MotorSearchFullText.aspx?keyw=LARES\n\n2\n\nSee on the WEB http://www.esa.int/esapub/bulletin/bulletin135/bul135f bianchi.pdf.\n\nActually,\n\nthe\n\nlaunch\n\ndate\n\nhas\n\nbeen\n\npostponed\n\nto\n\nlate\n\n2010/early\n\n2011.\n\nhttp://www.spacenews.com/civil/100115-asi-expects-budget-remain-flat-2010.html\n3\n\nIn its originally proposed configuration (Ciufolini 1986) the semi-major axis of LARES\n\nwas equal to that of LAGEOS, i.e. a = 12270 km.\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n\nTable 1: LAGEOS, LAGEOS II and LARES: orbital parameters and node precessions due to\nthe terrestrial gravitomagnetic field and the first two even zonal harmonics for L\u2295 = 5.86 \u00d7\n1033 kg m2 s\u22121 (McCarthy and Petit 2004), J2 = 0.00108263538, J4 = \u22121.619989 \u00d7 10\u22126 .\n(Tapley et al. 2007)\n\u03a9\u0307LT (mas yr\u22121 )\n\n\u03a9\u0307J2 (mas yr\u22121 )\n\n\u03a9\u0307J4 (mas yr\u22121 )\n\n0.0045 109.9\n\n30.7\n\n4.538082658 \u00d7 108\n\n\u22122.501490 \u00d7 105\n\nLAGEOS II 12163\n\n0.014\n\n52.65\n\n31.5\n\n\u22128.303252509 \u00d7 108\n\n9.05051 \u00d7 104\n\nLARES\n\n0.0\n\n71.5\n\n118.1\n\n\u22122.0298207310 \u00d7 109\n\n2.8925357 \u00d7 106\n\nSatellite\n\na (km)\n\ne\n\nLAGEOS\n\n12270\n\n7828\n\nI (deg)\n\ncoefficients Jl , l = 2, 4, 6, ... of the multipolar expansion of the terrestrial gravitational\npotential accounting for the centrifugal oblateness of our planet (Kaula 1966) are a major\nsource of systematic uncertainty. They can be written as\n\u03a9\u0307obl =\n\nX\n\n\u03a9\u0307.l Jl ,\n\n(2)\n\nl=2\n\nwhere the coefficients \u03a9\u0307.l depend on the Earth's mass M and equatorial radius R, and of\nthe orbital geometry of the satellite through a, e and the inclination I of the orbital plane to\nthe Earth's equator. Since they have the same temporal signature of the relativistic effect\nof interest, they cannot be subtracted from the signal without affecting the recovery of the\nLense-Thirring effect itself. Thus, it is of the utmost importance to realistically assess the\nuncertainty in them in order to evaluate their percent impact on the gravitomagnetic shift.\nMore specifically, the magnitude of the node secular precessions due to the first two even\nzonals for LAGEOS, LAGEOS II and LARES are listed in Table 1. It can be noted that\nthe J2 \u2212induced rates are of the order of 108 \u2212 109 mas yr\u22121 , i.e. seven orders of magnitude\nlarger than the Lense-Thirring precessions. The perturbations by J4 are of the order of\n105 \u2212 106 mas yr\u22121 , i.e. four orders of magnitude larger than the gravitomagnetic effects.\nSuch figures immediately demonstrate the difficulty of determining a smallish relativistic\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\neffect with respect to a huge classical one, which needs, thus, to be accounted for with the\nappropriate accuracy (about one part in 1010 ), or, as combining the three satellite data sets\naims at (see Section 3), removed from the signal with the same accuracy.\nUp to now major efforts have been devoted to evaluate the bias due to the lingering\nuncertainty \u03b4Jl in the even zonals according to\n\u03b4 \u03a9\u0307obl\nJl \u2264\n\nX\nl=2\n\n|\u03a9\u0307.l |\u03b4Jl .\n\n(3)\n\nA reliable evaluation of such a corrupting effect is made difficult by the fact that the\nrelatively low altitude of LARES brings into play more even zonals than done by LAGEOS\nand LAGEOS II (Iorio 2009).\nConcerning the non-conservative orbital perturbations (Milani et al. 1987) like direct\nsolar radiation pressure, Earth's albedo, direct Earth's infrared radiation, atmospheric\ndrag, thermal effects like the Yarkovski-Schach and Rubincam ones, they have been so far\nregarded as a minor concern because their direct impact on the node of the LAGEOS-type\nsatellites is . 1% of the Lense-Thirring effect (Lucchesi 2001, 2002).\nIn this paper we want to investigate their indirect effects through the cross-coupling\n(Kaula 1966)\n\u03b4 \u03a9\u0307obl\nI \u2264\n\n\u2202 \u03a9\u0307.l\nJl \u03b4I\n\u2202I\n\n(4)\n\nbetween the zonals-induced node precessions and certain non-gravitational perturbations\naffecting the LARES inclination. We will show that, in particular, the impact of the\natmospheric drag on ILR may play an important role in the evaluation of the error budget\nof the Lense-Thirring test. Indeed, although the direct secular effect of the atmospheric\ndrag on the node vanishes, it is not so for the indirect one due to the non-vanishing secular\ndecrease of the inclination which maps onto a node effect. Moreover, we will point out\nthat it should not be possible to correct the signal for the measured value of I arc by\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\narc without likely affecting the gravitomagnetic signal of interest itself. Clearly, since the\nnon-gravitational perturbations do depend on the particular type of satellite considered\nand since LARES has not yet been launched in orbit, our investigation should not be\nrequired to be more accurate than it can be in the sense that it must be viewed as a\nreasonable sensitivity analysis pointing out a possible source of potential bias and evaluating\nconservatively the largest possible size of the effect examined.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we calculate the secular rate of the\ninclination of a LAGEOS-type satellite induced by a drag force and compute it for LARES.\nIn Section 3 we calculate its indirect effect on the Lense-Thirring shift through the secular\nprecession due to the even zonal harmonics. We also briefly discuss other non-gravitational\nperturbations which may cause a secular variation of the LARES inclination in Section 4.\nSection 5 is devoted to the conclusions.\n\n2.\n\nThe effect of the atmospheric drag on the inclination of LARES\n\nThe Gauss equation for the variation of the inclination I is (Milani et al. 1987)\ndI\nr cos u\n\u221a\n=\nA\u03bd ,\n2\ndt\nna 1 \u2212 e2\n\n(5)\n\n.\n. p\nwhere n = GM/a3 is the un-perturbed Keplerian mean motion, u = g + f is the argument\nof latitude, defined as the sum of the argument of pericentre g, which fixes the position of\n\nthe pericentre with respect to the line of the nodes, and the true anomaly f which reckons\nthe instantaneous position of the spacecraft from the pericentre, and A\u03bd is the out-of-plane\ncomponent of the perturbing acceleration A.\nThe drag force per unit mass is (King-Hele 1987)\n1\nAD = \u2212 CD \u03a3\u03c1V V ,\n2\n\n(6)\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nwhere\nV =v\u2212VA\n\n(7)\n\nis the satellite velocity with respect to the atmosphere; v and V A are the geocentric\nsatellite and atmosphere velocities, respectively. The other parameters entering eq. (6) are\nthe drag coefficient CD , which depends in a complicated way on the interaction between\nthe gas of particles in the surroundings of the satellite and its surface (Afonso et al. 1985;\n.\nMilani et al. 1987), \u03a3 = S/m is the area-to-mass ratio4 of the satellite, and \u03c1 is the density\nof the atmosphere.\nThe velocity of the atmosphere, known as ambient velocity, can be written in terms of\ngeocentric inertial quantities as\nV A = \u03c9 A \u00d7 r,\n\n(8)\n\n\u03c9 A = (1 + \u03be)\u03c9\u2295 = (1 + \u03be)\u03c9\u2295 k,\n\n(9)\n\nwith\n\nwhere k is the unit vector of the z\u2212axis in an inertial geocentric frame chosen aligned\nwith the Earth's angular velocity vector. Note that eq. (9) accounts for the fact that the\natmosphere, in general, does not co-rotate exactly with the Earth; maximum observed\ndeviations from the simplifying assumption of exact co-rotation are of the order of 40%\n(King-Hele 1987). Thus,\nV A = \u03c9A (\u2212y i + x j) ,\n\n(10)\n\nwhere i and j are the unit vectors in the reference {xy} plane of the geocentric inertial\nframe which coincides with the Earth's equator; the angle between v, which lies in the\norbital plane, and V A is the inclination I.\n4\n\nS denotes the spacecraft cross sectional area (perpendicular to the velocity).\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nIn order to have the out-of-plane component A\u03bd of the drag acceleration evaluated onto\nthe un-perturbed Keplerian ellipse, to be inserted into the right-hand-side of eq. (5), V\nmust be projected onto the n\u0302 direction of the frame co-moving with the satellite; since\nn\u0302 = sin I sin \u03a9 i \u2212 sin I cos \u03a9 j + cos I k,\n\n(11)\n\nV A * n\u0302 = \u2212\u03c9A x sin I.\n\n(12)\n\nx = r cos u cos \u03a9 \u2212 sin u cos I sin \u03a9,\n\n(13)\n\nthen, by choosing \u03a9 = 0,\n\nOnto the unperturbed orbit\n\nso that it is possible to obtain\nV A * n\u0302 = \u2212\u03c9A r sin I cos u.\n\n(14)\n\nv = vr r\u0302 + vt t\u0302,\n\n(15)\n\nSince\n\nit appears clear that if the Earth's atmosphere did not rotate there would not be any\nout-of-plane component of the drag acceleration which, instead, exists because V A * n\u0302 6= 0\nfor non-equatorial orbits. Thus, the out-of-plane component of eq.

In general, \u03c1 undergoes many irregular and\ncomplex variations both in position and time, being largely affected by solar activity and\nby the heating and cooling of the atmosphere (King-Hele 1987; Abd El-Salam and Sehnal\n2004).\nAccording to Table ??, the inclination of LARES will experience a secular decrease of\n\u001c \u001d\ndI\n= \u22123 \u00d7 10\u22129 rad yr\u22121 = \u22120.6 mas yr\u22121 ,\n(23)\ndt LR\n5\n\n\u2206I in (Milani et al. 1987) is the shift per revolution; in order to be confronted with eq.\n\n(22), (6.17) by Milani et al.

The value of the area-to-mass ratio \u03a3\nhas been obtained by using for LARES a diameter of d = 37.6 cm and a mass of m = 400\nkg (http://esamultimedia.esa.int/docs/LEX-EC/CubeSat%20CFP%20issue%201.pdf). The\nvalue of \u03c1 is that for the Ajisai satellite (Sengoku et al. 1996) which has a semimajor axis of\n7870 km.

Concerning the node, whose Gauss variation\nequation is identical to eq.

For LARES eq. (25) yields a shift of 18.8 mas yr\u22121 over one year; since the LenseThirring precession of the node of LARES amounts to 118 mas yr\u22121 , the cross-coupling of\nthe inclination perturbation with the oblateness would yield a systematic error of 16% over\njust one year.\nIn fact, the data of LARES will be combined with those of the existing LAGEOS and\nLAGEOS II spacecraft according to the following linear combination of their nodes (Iorio\n2005)\n\u03a9\u0307LAGEOS + c1 \u03a9\u0307LAGEOS\n\nII\n\n+ c2 \u03a9\u0307LARES , c1 = 0.358642219, c2 = 0.075117522\n\n(26)\n\nin order to cancel out the impact of the mismodelling \u03b4J2 and \u03b4J4 of the first two even zonal\nharmonics; the general relativistic prediction of the total Lense-Thirring shift, according\nto the linear combination of eq. (26), is 50.7 mas yr\u22121 . The combination of eq. (26) is\nbased on a strategy put forth for the first time in (Ciufolini 1996). It turns out that the\nimpact of eq. (22) on eq. (26) is 3% yr\u22121 . Note that since c1 and c2 are aimed at removing\nthe classical effects by J2 and J4 to the needed extent, we released them with nine decimal\ndigits, i.e. with the matching accuracy. Indeed, as shown by Table 1, the largest classical\neffect is about seven orders of magnitude larger than the Lense-Thirring precessions, and\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nthe claimed accuracy of the proposed test is 1%. In obtaining such a result we treated\nthe coefficients c1 and c2 , which depend on the semi-major axes, the eccentricities and\nthe inclinations of the three satellites, as constant numbers; let us check if a conservative\nuncertainty of the order of6 \u03b4ILR \u2243 1 mas in ILR can affect the numerical values of c1 and\nc2 at the ninth decimal digit. It turns out that\n|c1 (ILR ) \u2212 c1 (ILR + \u03b4ILR )| = 1.7 \u00d7 10\u22129, |c2 (ILR ) \u2212 c2 (ILR + \u03b4ILR )| = 3 \u00d7 10\u221210 .\n\n(27)\n\nThus, we can conclude that the uncertainty in determining the inclination of LARES is\nnot a concern about the accuracy required to compute c1 and c2 . By repeating the same\nanalysis for the semimajor axis aLR of LARES, it turns out that an uncertainty \u03b4aLR \u2243 1\ncm yields a similar conclusion because\n|c1 (aLR ) \u2212 c1 (aLR + \u03b4aLR )| = 5 \u00d7 10\u221210 , |c2 (aLR ) \u2212 c2 (aLR + \u03b4aLR )| = 5 \u00d7 10\u221210 .\n\n(28)\n\nLet us see what could be the impact of the uncertainties in parameters like CD and\n\u03c9A on our estimates. For 2 < CD < 2.5 we get a substantially unchanged bias 2.7 \u2212 3.4%\nyr\u22121 . By assuming \u03c9A = \u03c9\u2295 = 7.292115 \u00d7 10\u22125 s\u22121 , i.e. by assuming that the atmosphere\nco-rotates with the Earth, the bias amounts to 2.5% yr\u22121 . Concerning the approximation of\n\u221a\neq. (17) used for V , i.e. V = v kR \u2243 v, it is fully justified in our case. Indeed, (VA /v) cos I\nappearing in it can be approximated with (\u03c9A /n) cos I for a circular orbit; for LARES it\n\u221a\namounts to 0.03 only, thus yielding kR = 0.97. It must be noted that the effect of eq. (25)\nshould likely affect the LARES data in full because of the difficulty of realistically modelling\nthe drag force, especially CD and \u03c1; just to give an idea of the uncertainty in their values\nnote that when the solar activity is low a typical atmospheric density at about 1500 km\naltitude is 2 \u00d7 10\u221216 kg m\u22123 (Sengoku et al. 1996), while for the existing LAGEOS satellite\n6\n\nIn fact, it may likely be about one order of magnitude smaller because \u03b4r \u2243 1 cm yields\n\nan uncertainty of approximately 0.3 mas at an height of 1450 km.\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nthe drag coefficient is CD \u2243 4.9 (Afonso et al. 1985; Milani et al. 1987). The fact that CD\nis larger for LAGEOS than for a lower satellite like LARES is only seemingly contradictory\n(the higher the orbit, the smaller the drag). Indeed, the drag coefficient depends on the\nratio between the average thermal molecular speed of the atmosphere VT and the orbital\nspeed v of the spacecraft. For relatively low orbits, VT \u2243 1 km s\u22121 is typically smaller\nthan7 v \u2243 7.5 km s\u22121 . On the contrary, at higher altitudes the situation changes because\nv becomes smaller and smaller, while VT increases rapidly due to higher temperatures and\nlower mean molecular weight. In this case, as for LAGEOS, (Afonso et al. 1985)\n\"\n*\u0012 \u0013 +\n*\u0012 \u0013 +#\n2\n4\n4\n2\nVT\nVT\nCD = b 2 +\n\u2212\n,\n3\nv\n15\nv\n\n(29)\n\nwith b \u2243 1.4 and hVT /vi \u2243 0.8, so that CD \u2243 4. For more details, see the discussion in\n(Milani et al. 1987), pp.104-107.\nIn addition to the neutral particle drag considered so far it should also be taken into\naccount the charged particle drag (Afonso et al. 1985) due to the fact that a spacecraft\nmoving in a gas of electrons and ions tends to acquire an electric charge because of the\ncollisions with such particles and also because of the photoelectric effect caused by solar\nradiation. The effect of the charged particle drag can be obtained by re-scaling the one due\nto the neutral particle drag by a multiplicative factor b containing, among other things,\nthe satellite's potential V0 . According to Lucchesi and Paolozzi (2001), it may amount to\nabout V0 = \u22120.3 V for LARES, so that b = 3.1 which implies a 9% yr\u22121 systematic error\nin the measurement of the Lense-Thirring effect with eq. (26). It must be pointed out that\nthe reduction of the impact of the perturbing accelerations of thermal origin should have\nbeen reached by the LARES team with two concentric spheres. However, as explained by\nAndr\u00e9s (2007), this solution will increase the floating potential of LARES because of the\n7\n\nFor LARES (see Table 1 for its orbital parameters) it is v = 7.1 km s\u22121 .\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nmuch higher electrical resistivity, so that the evaluations presented here may turn out to be\noptimistic.\nSince the extraction of the relativistic effect would require a multi-year analysis,\ntypically \u2206t = 5 \u2212 10 yr, the action of the overall atmospheric drag on the LARES\ninclination may be a serious corrupting effect over such timescales.\nCiufolini et al. (2009) objected that, in fact, the disturbing effect examined would\nnot appear in the real data analysis procedure because the inclination along with all the\nother Keplerian orbital elements would be8 \"measured\" arc by arc, so that one should\nonly have to correct the signal for the measured value of the inclination; after all, the\nsame problems, if not even larger, would occur with the semimajor axes of the LAGEOS\nsatellites, which are known to undergo still unexplained secular decrease of 1.1 mm d\u22121\n(Rubincam 1982) and their consequent mappings onto the node rates. The problem is that\nwhile a perturbation \u2206a pertains the in-plane, radial R component (Christodoulidis et al.\n1988) of the LAGEOSs' orbits, both the Lense-Thirring node precession and the shifts in\nthe inclination affect the out-of-plane, normal N component (Christodoulidis et al. 1988)\nof the orbit; thus, even if repeated corrections to the semimajor axis could be applied\nwithout affecting the gravitomagnetic signal of interest, the same would not hold for the\ninclination. This is particularly true in view of the fact that, for still unexplained reasons,\nthe Lense-Thirring effect itself has never been estimated, either as a short-arc or as a\nglobal parameter. Moreover, Ciufolini et al. (2009) claimed that the recent improvements in\natmospheric refraction modelling would allow to \"measure\" the inclination of the LAGEOSs\nsatellites at a level of accuracy, on average, of 30 \u03bcas for LAGEOS and 10 \u03bcas for LAGEOS\nII. Firstly, the tracking of a relatively low satellite is always more difficult than for higher\n8\n\nActually, the Keplerian orbital elements are not directly measurable quantities, contrary\n\nto, e.g., ranges, range-rates, right ascension, declination.\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\ntargets, so that caution would be needed in straightforwardly extrapolating results valid for\nLAGEOS to the still non-existing LARES. Second, it is difficult to understand the exact\nsense of such claims because they would imply an accuracy \u03b4r \u2243 a\u03b4I in reconstructing the\norbits of LAGEOS and LAGEOS II, on average, of 0.2 cm and 0.06 cm, respectively.\n\n4.\n\nOther effects potentially inducing secular variations of the LARES\ninclination\n\nAmong the other non-conservative forces acting on the LAGEOS-type satellites, also\nthe Rubincam (1987) effect, due to the anisotropic re-emission of the infrared radiation of\nthe Earth along the satellite's spin axis, is important. Such an effect arises from the fact\nthat the retroreflectors of LAGEOS have a significant thermal inertia of about 3000 s; since\nsuch time of thermal response is shorter than the satellite's orbital period Pb = 13526 s and\nlarger than the spin period, whose nominal value was about 1 s at the launch epoch, the\nperturbation induces a temperature asymmetry between the hemisphere facing the Earth\nand the one opposite to it. The illuminated hemisphere becomes hotter than the dark one\nonly after the Earth has passed its pole, causing a time lag effect accounted for by the\nthermal lag angle \u03b8. A net recoil acceleration ARub directed along the satellite spin axis\noccurs. It induces a secular rate of the inclination according to (Lucchesi 2002)\n\u001c \u001d\n\u0001\ndI\nARub\n=\u2212\nsin \u03b8 sin 2I 3\u03c3z2 \u2212 1 .\ndt\n8na\n\n(30)\n\nIn it ARub is the Rubincam acceleration which depends in a complex way on the physical\nand thermal properties of the satellite and of its array of retro-reflectors, \u03b8 is the thermal\nlag angle, and \u03c3z is the component of the satellite's spin along the z axis of a geocentric\nequatorial inertial frame having the x axis along the vernal equinox direction. For LAGEOS\nII the secular inclination rate is of the order of 1.5 mas yr\u22121 . By assuming for LARES the\nsame value of ARub as for LAGEOS II, i.e. ARub \u2243 \u22127 \u00d7 10\u221212 m s\u22122 , eq. (30) yields an\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\neffect of the order of about 0.7 mas yr\u22121 . In fact, it might be finally smaller because of the\ncurrently ongoing manufacturing efforts of the LARES team aimed at reducing the impact\nof the non-gravitational perturbations of thermal origin on the new spacecraft with respect\nto the LAGEOS satellites (Bosco et al. 2007). Moreover, it will depend on the direction of\nthe satellite's spin at the injection in orbit.\n\n5.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this paper we have shown that certain subtle non-gravitational perturbations acting\non the forthcoming LARES satellite may corrupt the claimed goal of performing a \u2243 1%\nmeasurement of the Lense-Thirring effect in the gravitational field of the rotating Earth\nbecause of the lower altitude of the new spacecraft with respect to the existing LAGEOS\nand LAGEOS II spacecraft. In particular, the interplay between the node precessions due\nto the even zonal harmonics of the geopotential, which are a major source of systematic\nerror, and the LARES inclination has been investigated. The atmospheric drag, both in\nits neutral and charged components, will induce a non-negligible secular decrease of the\ninclination of the new spacecraft yielding a correction to the node precession of degree l = 2\nwhich amounts to 3 \u2212 9% yr\u22121 of the total gravitomagnetic signal pertaining just the node\nitself. Such a corrupting bias would be very difficult to be modeled. Since the extraction of\nthe relativistic signature will require a data analysis of about 5 \u2212 10 yr, the effect examined\nhere may yield a degradation of the achievable total accuracy of the test. In principle, also\nthe Rubincam effect, of thermal origin, should be taken into account because it can induce\na non-vanishing secular variation of the inclination. Since both the node and the inclination\nenter the out-of-plane, normal component of the orbit of a satellite, it would not be possible\nto correct for the measured values of the inclinations arc by arc without likely affecting also\nthe Lense-Thirring signal itself, especially because it has never been estimated along with\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\nthe other parameters.\n\nAcknowledgments\nI am grateful to an anonymous referee for his/her detailed and helpful comments.\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\nREFERENCES\nF.A.
