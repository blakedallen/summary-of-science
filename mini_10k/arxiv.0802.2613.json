In particular, the evolution and the dynamical interactions of binaries in high-density environments can generate objects (like Blue Straggler Stars,\nX-ray binaries, millisecond pulsars, etc.) that cannot be explained by standard stellar evolution. In this respect the most common exotic objects are the so-called Blue Straggler Stars\n(BSS). They are defined as those stars brighter and bluer (hotter) than the Main Sequence\nTurnOff (MS-TO), lying along an extrapolation of the MS. BSS are more massive than the\nnormal MS stars (Shara et al. 1997), thus indicating that some processes which increase the\ninitial mass of single stars must be at work. These could be related either to mass-transfer\n(MT) or merging processes between members of primordial binaries (PB-BSS), which mainly\nevolve in isolation in low density environment, or the merger of two single or binary stars\ndriven by stellar collisions (COL-BSS), which are particularly efficient in high density regions.\nAs shown by Ferraro et al. (2003), the two formation channels can have comparable efficiency\nin producing BSS in their respective typical environment (see the case of M80 and NGC288,\nFerraro et al. 1999, Bellazzini et al. 2002). Moreover, these formation mechanisms could\n1\n\nBased on observations with the NASA/ESA HST, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute,\nwhich is operated by AURA, Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555. Also based on data acquired using\nthe Large Binocular Telescope (LBT). The LBT is an international collaboration among institutions in the\nUnited States, Italy and Germany. LBT Corporation partners are: The University of Arizona on behalf of the\nArizona university system; Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica, Italy; LBT Beteiligungsgesellschaft, Germany,\nrepresenting the Max-Planck Society, the Astrophysical Institute Potsdam, and Heidelberg University; The\nOhio State University, and The Research Corporation, on behalf of The University of Notre Dame, University\nof Minnesota and University of Virginia. This research used the facilities of the Canadian Astronomy Data\nCentre operated by the National Research Council of Canada with the support of the Canadian Space\nAgency.\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nalso act simultaneously within the same cluster, with efficiencies that depend on the radial\nregions, corresponding to widely different stellar densities. This hypothesis was suggested\nfor the first time by Ferraro et al. (1993, 1997; hereafter F97): by using a proper combination of high-resolution and wide-field observations they studied the projected BSS radial\ndistribution of the GC M3 over the entire cluster extension. The distribution turned out to\nbe bimodal: it reaches the maximum at the center of the cluster, shows a clear-cut dip in the\nintermediate region (at 4rc < r < 8rc ), and rises again in the outer region (out to r \u223c 14rc ).\nWhile the bimodality detected in M3 was considered for years to be peculiar, the most recent\nresults demonstrated that this is not the case. The same observational strategy adopted by\nF97 in M3 has been applied to a number of other Galactic GCs, to study the BSS radial\ndistribution over the entire cluster extension. Bimodal distributions with an external upturn\nhave been detected in several cases: 47 Tuc (Ferraro et al. 2004), NGC 6752 (Sabbi et al.\n2004), M55 (Zaggia et al. 1997; Lanzoni et al. 2007a), M5 (Warren et al. 2006; Lanzoni et al.\n2007b), NGC 6388 (Dalessandro et al. 2007) and NGC 5466 (Beccari et al. 2008, in preparation). Extensive dynamical simulations (Mapelli et al. 2006; Lanzoni et al. 2007a) have been\nperformed: they suggest that the observed central peak is mainly due to COL-BSS formed\nin the core and/or PB-BSS sunk to the centre because of dynamical friction effects, while\nthe external rising branch is made of PB-BSS evolving in isolation in the cluster outskirts.\nEven though the number of the surveyed clusters is low, the bimodal radial distribution\nfirst found in M3 and originally thought to be peculiar appears instead to be the natural one.\nHowever, generalizations made from a small samples are dangerous. Indeed, a few exceptions\nare already known: the BSS population in the high density GC NGC 1904 turns out to be\nhighly centrally segregated but it does not show any external upturn (Lanzoni et al. 2007c).\nMoreover the BSS population in the massive GCs \u03c9 Cen (Ferraro et al. 2006a) and NGC2419\n(Dalessandro et al., 2008) has a radial distribution completely indistinguishable from that\nof other \"normal\" cluster stars. This is the cleanest evidence that these GCs are not fully\nrelaxed, even in the central regions, and it suggests that the observed BSS are the progeny\nof primordial binaries, whose radial distribution was not yet significantly altered by stellar\ncollisions and by the dynamical evolution of the cluster.\nAn even deeper insight on the BSS formation mechanism can be obtained by means\nof spectroscopic surveys able to measure the BSS surface abundance patterns. Recently\nFerraro et al. (2006b) discovered that a sub-population of BSS in 47 Tuc shows a significant\ndepletion in the Carbon and Oxygen surface abundances, with respect to the dominant\nBSS population and the normal cluster stars. Since incomplete CNO-burning products are\nexpected at the surface of PB-BSS (Sarna & de Greve 1996), while normal abundances are\npredicted for COL-BSS (Lombardi et al. 1995), this discovery represents the first detection of\na chemical signature clearly pointing to the MT formation process for BSS in a GC. However,\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nfurther spectroscopical analysis of BSS in a large sample of GCs are necessary in order\nto statistically increase the significance of the results obtained for 47Tuc. Unfortunately,\nbecause of the hostile environmental conditions (high crowding conditions of the cores of\nGCs), such observations are quite difficult. On the other side, photometric surveys, easier to\nperform, will allow to determine how common bimodality is, and what are its consequences\nfor the theories of BSS formation and cluster dynamics.\nHere we present a multiband photometric study of the GC NGC 5024 (M53), performed\nthrough a proper combination of data obtained by using three different telescopes: the\nHubble Space Telescope (HST), the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) and the CanadaFrance-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT). This large data-set allow us to resolve, for the first time,\nthe stellar populations of this cluster from the very central regions out to a radius of 0.5\ndegree (\u223c 155 pc, assumming a distance from the Sun of 17.8 Kpc from Harris 1996) from\nthe center. In Section 2 we present the observation and data reduction strategy. In Section 3\nwe describe the homogenization of the sample through accurate astrometry and photometric\ncalibration. In section 4 we show the observed radial density profile of the cluster and the\ncomparison with King models. Finally, in Section 6 we study the BSS radial distribution of\nthe cluster.\n\n2.\n\nObservations and data reduction\n\nThe photometric data used here consist of two main data sets. The high resolution\nsample consists of a set of HST images of the core region obtained with the Advanced Camera for Survey (ACS) through the F606W and F816W filters (GO-10775;P.I.: Sarajedini;\nsee Table 1). All images were passed through the standard ACS/WFC reduction pipeline.\nGiving our interest in the brightest stars of the cluster and since stellar crowding is low in\nthese images, we decided to perform aperture photometry using the SExtractor photometric\npackage (Bertin et al. 1996), with an aperture radius of 0.15\u2032\u2032 (corresponding to a FWHM\nof 3 pixels). The source detection and the photometric analysis have been performed independently on each image. In the deepest exposure images only stars detected in three out\nfive frames have been included in the final catalog. Finally, each ACS pointing has been\ncorrected for geometric distortion using the prescriptions by Hack & Cox (2001) and a final\ncatalogue was obtained. Since the central regions of the cluster are positioned in the very\ncenter of the ACS field of view (FoV), were also the gap between the two chips of the ACS\nis located, we decided to use a photometric catalogue of the cluster core obtained through\nthe Planetary Camera (PC) chip of the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 on board of HST.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nThis has been retrieved from the HST Snapshot published by Piotto et al. (2002)2 .\nThe wide field sample consists of deep multi-filter (U, B and V ; see Table 1) wide-field images, secured during the Science Demonstration Time (SDT) of LBC-Blue (Ragazzoni et al.\n2006; Giallongo et al. 2008) mounted on the LBT, sited at Mount Graham, Arizona (Hill et al.\n2006). The LBC is a wide-field imager which provides an effective 23\u2032 \u00d7 23\u2032 FoV, sampled at\n0.224 arcsec/pixel over four chips of 2048 \u00d7 4608 pixels each. LBC-Blue is optimized for the\nUV\u2013blue wavelengths, from 320 to 500 nm, and is equipped with the U, B, V , g and r filters.\nThe core of the cluster has been positioned in the central chip (namely #2) of the LBC-Blue\nCCD mosaic. Here we present only the photometric reduction of the shortest exposures (see\nTable 1). The photometry of the complete data-set, including the longest exposures, will be\npresented in a forthcoming paper (Beccari et al. 2008, in preparation). The raw LBC images\nwere corrected for bias and flat field, and the overscan region was trimmed using a pipeline\nspecifically developed for LBC image pre-reduction from LBC-team at Rome Astronomical\nObservatory3 . The source detection and relative photometry was performed independently\non each U, B and V image, using the PSF-fitting code DaoPHOTII/ALLSTAR (Stetson\n1987, 1994).\nIn order to sample the entire extension of the cluster, additional archive g and r widefield MEGACAM images were taken from the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre (CADC4 ).\nMounted at CFHT (Hawaii), the wide-field imager MEGACAM (built by CEA, France),\nconsists of 36 2048 x 4612 pixel CCDs (a total of 340 megapixels), fully covering a 1 degree x 1\ndegree FoV with a resolution of 0.187 arcsecond/pixel. The data are preprocessed (removal of\nthe instrumental signature) and calibrated (photometry and astrometry) by Elixir pipeline.\nGiving the very low crowding conditions of the external regions, we performed aperture\nphotometry using SExtractor with an aperture radius of 0.9\u2032\u2032 (corresponding to a FWHM of\n5 pixels). Each of the 36 chips was reduced separately, and we finally obtained a catalogue\nlisting the relative positions and magnitudes of stars in common between the g and r data-set.\n2\n\nThe catalogue is available at web site http://www.astro.unipd.it/globulars/\n\n3\n\nhttp://lbc.oa-roma.inaf.it/\n\n4\n\nhttp://www3.cadc-ccda.hia-iha.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/cadc/\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n3.\n\nHomogenization of the catalogues: Astrometry and Photometric\ncalibrations\n\nIn Figure 1 we show a map of the adopted data-sets. In order to properly combine the\navailable catalogues is crucial to find a proper astrometric solution over the entire sampled\narea. For this purpose we used the same method largely employed and described in the\nliterature (see for example Lanzoni et al. 2007a, and references therein). We used thousand\nstars in common with a SDSS catalogue5 covering an area of 1 square degree, centered on\nthe cluster, in order to obtain an absolute astrometric solution for each of the 36 chips over\nthe MEGACAM FoV, with a final global accuracy of 0.3\u2032\u2032 r.m.s. both in right ascension\n(\u03b1) and declination (\u03b4); note that the WCS informations available in the FITS images\nprocessed by the Elixir pipeline are given with a global accuracy \u03c3 > 0\u2032\u2032 .5. The same\ntechnique applied to LBC-Blue sample gave an astrometric solution with similar accuracy,\ni.e. \u03c3 < 0.3\u2032\u2032 r.m.s.. Considering that the very central regions of the cluster are not provided\nwith standard astrometric stars, we used the stars in LBC-Blue catalogue as secondary\nastrometric standards for finding a good astrometric solution for the high-resolution sample.\nWe thus obtained an astrometric solution for the stars in the core region with the same\naccuracy obtained in previous cases.\nThe different data sets were first calibrated in the respective photometric systems. The\nphotometric calibration of the g and r magnitudes in the MEGACAM sample was performed\nusing the stars in common with SDSS catalogue. In order to transform the instrumental B\nand V magnitudes of the LBC-Blue sample into the Johnson standard system we used the\nstars in common with a photometric catalogue previously published by Rey et al. (1998,\nhereafter R98). The most isolated and brightest stars in the ACS field have been used to\nlink the aperture magnitudes at 0.5\" to the instrumental ones, after normalizing for exposure\ntime. Instrumental magnitudes have been transformed into the VEGAMAG system by using\nthe photometric zero-points by Sirianni et al. (2005). Finally, the catalogue of the HST\nSnapshot is provided with the magnitudes both in the F 439W and F 555W flight system\nand in the standard Johnson B and V systems.\nAppropriate photometric transformations were then applied to convert the g and F 606W\ninto standard V Johnson. This allows us to use the V magnitudes as reference between all\nthe data-sets. In Figure 2 and 3 we show the CMDs of the high-resolution (ACS, left panel;\nWFPC2/PC, right panel) and wide-field samples (LBC-Blue, left panel; MEGACAM, right\npanel) respectively.\n5\n\nAvailable at web-site http://cas.sdss.org/dr6/en/tools/search/radial.asp\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nIn order to perform the most complete and homogeneous sampling of the cluster, we\ndecided to use the high-resolution dataset for the central area, the LBC-Blue catalog for the\nregion out to a radius r = 630\u2032\u2032 from the center, and the MEGACAM sample for r > 630\u2032\u2032 .\nMoreover, only stars in the magnitude range 16.5 < V < 21 have been considered in the\ncombined high resolution + wide-field catalogs. A completeness study performed over the\nACS images in the considered magnitude range has shown that the completeness is larger\nthan 90%. Moreover, we have verified that all the stars of the R98 catalogue lying in the\nregion in common with our LBC-Blue dataset are recovered in the LBC-Blue sample. Hence,\nfrom Figure 3 of R98, we estimated a level of completeness greater than 80% for the LBCBlue catalogue. Finally, by comparing star count density profiles in the region in common\nbetween the LBC-Blue and the MEGACAM data we verified that the two samples have the\nsame level of completeness.\n\n4.\n\nThe cluster density profile\n\nThe extended data set collected for this cluster offered the possibility to compute its\ndetailed radial star density profile, from the center, out to distances beyond the tidal radius (rt \u2243 22\u2032 from Harris 1996). Using the sample as previously defined (see also Figure 1)\nwe have determined the projected density profile of M53 by direct star counts. Following\nthe procedure already described in Lanzoni et al. (2007a), we have divided the entire sample into 27 concentric annuli, each split in an adequate number of sub-sectors (quadrants).\nThe number of stars lying within each sub-sector was counted, and the star density was obtained by dividing these values by the corresponding sub-sector areas. The stellar density in\neach annulus was then obtained as the average of the sub-sector densities, and the standard\ndeviation was estimated from the variance among the sub-sectors.\nThe radial density profile thus derived is plotted in Figures 4 and 5. Notice that from\na radius r \u2243 16.6\u2032 outwards, the statistical contamination of the background stars starts\nto dominate the stellar counts. The average of the two outermost surface density measures\nhas been adopted as the background contribution (corresponding to 0.57 stars/arcmin\u22122 ).\nOur profile is in excellent agreement with that published by Trager et al. (1995), in the\nregion from r = 0\u2032\u2032 to r \u2243 550\u2032\u2032 . In order to reproduce the observed profile, isotropic,\nsingle-mass King models have been computed. As shown in Figure 4, the best fit model\n(reduced \u03c72 = 2.3) is characterized by a core radius rc \u2243 25\u2032\u2032 and a concentration c \u2243 1.6. In\nFigure 5 (panel a) we show, for comparison, the King model with parameters rc \u2243 22\u2032\u2032 and\nc \u2243 1.8 adopted by Harris (1996). As apparent, the quality of the fit is significantly worse\n(\u03c72 = 5.5) than in the case of our best-fit model. As shown in panel b of Figure 5, a model\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nwith lower concentration (c = 1.45) and larger core radius (rc = 26\u2032\u2032 ) best reproduces the\ninner portion of the observed profile. In fact, considering the region within a radius r < 4.2\u2032 ,\nwe have \u03c72 \u2032 = 0.32, while for the best fit model we have \u03c72 \u2032 = 1. However the low\nr<4.2\nr<4.2\nconcentration model strongly disagrees with the observations in the outer regions, while the\ndiscrepancy is not statistically significant for the adopted best-fit model. Such a change of\nslope of the surface density profile might be the signature of the presence of tidally stripped\nstars (see Combes et al. 1999; Johnston et al. 1999; Leon et al. 2000, and references therein).\nThis aspect need to be further investigate since, up to now, no evidence of tidal tail have\nbeen detected for M53.\n\n5.\n\nThe cluster population selection\n\nIn Figure 2 we show the population of BSS (open circles) and horizontal branch (HB;\nopen triangles) stars selected in each data-set. Their number counts are reported in Table 2.\nAs largely discussed in the literature, in order to study the radial distribution of BSSs,\none needs to compare their number counts as a function of radius to those of a population\nassumed to trace the overall radial density distribution of the cluster. For homogeneity with\nour previous works (see Lanzoni et al. 2007a, and references therein), we decided to use the\nHorizontal Branch (HB) stars as reference population. The BSS selection box was initially\ndefined in the WFPC2/PC (B, B \u2212 V ), ACS (V, V \u2212 I) and LBC-Blue (B, B \u2212 V ) CMDs,\nas the region containing most of the BSSs in common with R98, who studied the BSS radial\ndistribution within \u223c 9\u2032 from the cluster center. Then the BSSs thus identified in the LBCBlue catalogue which are in common with the MEGACAM one, allowed us to properly define\na selection box in the (V, V \u2212 r) plane. Giving the excellent quality of all the CMDs, the\nHB population is easily separable from the Red and Asymptotic Giant Branch sequences.\nMoreover, the SX Phoenicis and RRlyrae stars identified by comparing our catalogues with\npreviously published works (Jeon et al. 2003; Clement et al. 2001, for the SX Phoenicis and\nRRlyrae, respectively), were included in the BSS and HB populations, respectively. All the\npopulations thus selected in each data-set, are marked in Figure 2, and their number counts\nare reported in Table 2. Since at r > 16.6\u2032 the stellar counts start to be dominated by\nbackground stars (see Section 4), in the following analysis we only consider the BSS and HB\nstars within this distance from the cluster center.\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\n6.\n\nResults: the BSS radial distribution\n\nThe radial distribution of BSSs identified in M53 has been studied following the same\nprocedure previously adopted for other clusters (see Lanzoni et al. 2007a, and references\ntherein). In Figure 6, we compare the BSS cumulative radial distribution to that of HB\nstars. As can be seen, the behavior of the two distributions is not monotonic since the\nBSSs appear to be more concentrated than the HB stars in the central region and less\nconcentrated in the outer region. This trend resembles that found for M3 by Ferraro et al.\n(1997). Following the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (KS), there is a probability of 95% that the\nBSS population has a different radial distribution with respect to that of HB stars.\nFor a more quantitative analysis, the surveyed area has been divided in concentric annuli\ncentered on the cluster center (from Harris 1996). We have chosen 7 concentric annuli (see\nTable 3), each containing a fairly similar number of HB stars. Then, we counted the number\nof BSSs (NBSS ) and HBs (NHB ), and we computed the NBSS /NHB ratio in each annulus.\nIn the upper panel of Figure 7 we show the radial distribution of this ratio. It clearly shows\na bimodality, with a high frequency of BSSs in the inner and outer regions, but a distinct\ndip in the intermediate region. The results for r < 9\u2032 well agree with those obtained by R98.\nThen, thanks to the much larger extension of our data-set, the existence of an upturn of the\nBSS radial distribution in the most external regions is clearly apparent. The significance of\nthe observed dip in the region 30\u2032\u2032 < r < 80\u2032\u2032 can be assessed by noting that 50 BSS (instead\nof the 25 observed) would be needed in this region in order to flatten the distribution. From\nPoisson statistics alone, the observed number (25) thus represents a 5\u03c3 fluctuation from\nthe expected value (50). An alternative possibility is that the BSS population is affected\nby a lower level of completeness than the HB one. In order to investigate this problem, we\nselected a population of Red Giant and Sub Giant Branch (RGB and SGB, respectively) stars\nin the same magnitude range as defined for the BSSs. In this case the KS test reveals that\nthe cumulative radial distribution of the RGB+SGB population (dotted line in Figure 6) is\ndifferent from that of BSS, with a 98.7% significance. By using this population as reference,\nwe calculated the ratio between NBSS and the number of RGB+SGB stars (simply NRGB )\nin the same annuli as previously defined. As shown in the lower panel of Figure 7, the radial\ndistribution of the specific frequency NBSS /NRGB shows exactly the same properties as that\nof NBSS /NHB .\nAs a further confirmation of this observational feature, we decided to study also the radial distribution of the BSS compared to HB stars normalized to the sampled luminosity. By\ndefining Npop the number of stars of a given population in a given ring, and Lsample the sampled light in that ring, the double normalized ratio (Rpop ) in each annulus is (Ferraro et al.\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\n1993)\nRpop =\n\ntot\nNpop /Npop\nLsample /Ltot\nsample\n\ntot\nwhere Npop\nand Ltot\nsample are the total sampled population and luminosity, respectively. The\nluminosity in each annulus has been calculated by summing up the luminosity of each sampled star (with 21 < V < 16.5). The double normalized ratio of BSS and HB stars calculated\nin each annulus is reported in Table 3, and their radial distribution is plotted in Figure 8.\nAs can be seen, the HB double normalized ratio remains essentially constant around unity\nover the surveyed area. This is in agreement with the fact that the fraction of HB (as of\nany post-MS) stars in each annulus strictly depends on the fraction of luminosity sampled\nin that annulus (see the relation in Renzini & Buzzoni 1986). In contrast, the BSS double\nnormalized ratio reaches a maximum at the center of the cluster, decreases and reaches a\nminimum at r \u223c 1\u2032 , and then rises again. This behavior fully confirms the trend shown in\nFigure 7 and suggests that dynamical events and/or different formation mechanisms shape\nthe radial distribution of the BSSs in the cluster (see Mapelli et al. 2006).\n\nAs previously discussed, a bimodal radial distribution of BSSs like the one found here\nfor M53 has been detected in several GCs studied with a similar observational strategy\n(e.g. M3, 47 Tuc, NGC6752, M5, M55; see references in Dalessandro et al. 2007). By using\nthe best-fit King model presented in Section 4, with central density and velocity dispersion\n\u03c10 = 2.2 \u00d7 103 M\u2299 /pc3 and \u03c3 \u223c 6.7 km s\u22121 , respectively (from McLaughlin & van der Marel\n2005), and assuming 12 Gyr as the cluster age, we estimated the value of the radius of\navoidance (ravoid ) from the dynamical friction time-scale formula (e.g., Mapelli et al. 2006).\nThis is defined as the radius within which all the stars of \u223c 1.2 M\u2299 (value that well represents\nthe average mass of the BSSs) have already sunk to the core because of dynamical friction\neffects. For M53 we found a value of ravoid \u2243 4.6rc , that corresponds to \u2243 115\u2032\u2032 by assuming\nrc = 25\u2032\u2032 and is marked with a vertical arrow in both panels of Figure 7. As apparent, this\nvalue is a factor of two larger than the observed minimum, which occurs at \u223c 2 rc from\nthe cluster center. For the adopted central velocity dispersion6 and for BSS masses ranging\nbetween 1 and 1.5 M\u2299 , completely unrealistic cluster ages (t < 4 Gyr) would be necessary in\norder to reconcile the value of ravoid with the position of the observed minimum. However, if\n\u03c3 is underestimated by 50% (i.e., if \u03c3 = 10 km/s), an agreement between the two quantities\nis found for t \u223c 10 \u2212 12 Gyr and MBSS 1 \u2212 1.2 M\u2299 . An observational measure of the central\nvelocity dispersion of M53 and accurate dynamical simulations are therefore urgent in order\nto better understand the origin of the observed discrepancy.\n6\n\nNote that the value listed by McLaughlin & van der Marel (2005) is not observed but derived from a\ndynamical King model.\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nIndeed, although our estimate of ravoid is quite rough, it is interesting to note that in most\nof the clusters with a bimodal BSS radial distribution, ravoid has been found to be located\nwithin the region of the observed minimum (see Dalessandro et al. 2007, and references\ntherein). The main exception to this rule is the case of NGC6388, where Dalessandro et al.\n(2007) found that ravoid is 3 times larger than the position of the observed minimum. The\nresult presented here for M53 is similar to that of NGC6388 and it suggests that in a few\nclusters the dynamical friction seems to be somehow less efficient than expected. Which is\nthe origin of this low efficiency? Could the history of each individual cluster play a role in\nthis?\nWe also note that the value of ravoid estimated for M53 is very similar to that found\nfor M3 (\u223c 4.9 rc ; Mapelli et al. 2006), Moreover, the two clusters seem to share some similarities: (1) the structural parameters (listed in Table 4) are quite similar; (2) the specific\nfrequency NBSS /NHB within 20\u2032\u2032 from the cluster center is similar (0.51 \u00b1 0.01, 0.53 \u00b1 0.01\nfor M53 and M3, respectively). In Figure 9 the radial distribution of NBSS /NHB for the two\nclusters is shown. As apparent, while the computed values of ravoid turn out to be located\nat approximately the same distance in the two clusters, the location of the observed minimum of the distribution is sensibly different: in particular, in M53 the region where the\ndynamical friction has been efficient in segregating massive stars toward the cluster center\nis significantly more internal than in M3.\nHence, while the central value of the specific frequency suggest a similar overabundance\nof BSSs in the centre of the two clusters, the different location of the minimum of the\ndistributions suggests that M53 is dynamically younger than M3 (i.e. that, for some reasons,\nthe dynamical friction has been less efficient in M53). As shown in Mapelli et al. (2006), the\ncentral peak of the radial distribution of M3 is found to be mainly generated by COL-BSSs,\nwhile the external upturn is due to the presence of a genuine population of MT-BSS. While\nanalogous conclusions might also apply to the case of M53, the origin of the diversity needs\nto be further investigated through detailed numerical simulations. We once more emphasize\nthat the BSS radial distribution contains crucial information about the dynamical history\nand evolution of stellar systems.\nWe would thank the anonymous Referee for the rapid and useful comments.This research\nwas supported by the Agenzia Spaziale Italiana (under contract ASI-INAF I/016/07/0) and\nby the Ministero dell'Istruzione dell'Universit\u00e0 e della Ricerca.
