See review articles [1, 2] and [3],\nrespectively. In the cold fusion reactions only one neutron is emitted from the compound nucleus to form the final\ncompound-residue nucleus in its ground state. In hot fusion reactions more neutrons are emitted. At each step of\nthe deexcitation cascade the neutron evaporation competes with the dominating process of fission. Therefore the\nsynthesis cross section represents only a small part of the fusion cross section.\nA characteristic feature of the fusion-evaporation reactions leading to the synthesis of superheavy nuclei is enormous\nhindrance of the fusion process itself. Consequently, the cross sections for the synthesis of heaviest elements are\nmeasured in picobarns or even femtobarns. It is believed that the hindrance is caused by the highly dissipative\ndynamics of the fusing system in its passage over the saddle point on the way through the multidimensional potential\nenergy surface from the initial configuration of two touching nuclei into the configuration of the compound nucleus.\nZagrebaev and Greiner developed a method of solving Langevin equations of motion to describe this stochastic stage\nof the fusion process [4]. In spite of very time consuming Langevin trajectory calculations, in which only one of say\na million trajectories leads to formation of the compound nucleus, the model is used effectively to calculate synthesis\ncross sections for various reactions [5]. Another approach to the process of fusion of a \"dinuclear system\" (DNS)\nwas proposed in Ref. [6]. It was assumed in this model that the dinuclear system stays in contact configuration and\nundergoes successive transfer of all nucleons from the lighter nucleus to the heavier partner (in competition with the\nquasi-fission processes). Applications of this concept have been used in recent years by several groups. In still another\napproach, the \"fusion-by-diffusion\" model [8], the stochastic process of shape fluctuations that lead to the overcoming\nthe saddle point was described as the solution of the Smoluchowski diffusion equation in the deformation space along\nthe fission valley.\nThe cold fusion reactions leading to the synthesis of nuclei of Z \u2264 113 were studied systematically with the DNS\nmodel in Ref. [7], with the fusion-by-diffusion (FBD) model [8], [9] and with the Langevin dynamics model [5]. The\nhot fusion reactions leading to the synthesis of the heaviest nuclei of Z \u2265 114 have not been studied so systematically.\nIn Ref. [5] excitation functions for some selected reactions were calculated although they were not confronted with\nexperimental cross sections. Most of the publications on this topic concentrated on the predictions concerning possible\nways of synthesis of the heaviest elements of Z = 119 and 120 [5, 10\u201314, 16, 17]. Only very recently, an extensive\nstudy of cold and hot fusion reactions in terms of a phenomenological approach based on the DNS model was reported\n\n\f2\n[18].\nThere is one important aspect of all the models of the synthesis of superheavy nuclei that was not treated with\nproper attention so far. This is the question of the choice of theoretical fission barriers and ground-state masses\nwhich have to be adopted for the description of the deexcitation of the compound nucleus. It is well known that\ncalculations of the cross sections for synthesis of superheavy nuclei are extremely sensitive to the height of the fission\nbarrier, especially in case of \"hot\" fusion reactions, in which three or four neutrons are emitted from the compound\nnucleus. When the barrier heights are not known precisely, an error in evaluation of the \u0393n /\u0393f ratio in each step of\nthe (xn) deexcitation cascade accumulates x times leading to enormous errors in the calculation of the synthesis cross\nsections. (Here, \u0393n and \u0393f denote the neutron decay width and fission width, respectively.) Thus, precise knowledge\nof theoretical fission barriers and neutron binding energies (ground-state masses) is crucial for reasonable predictions\nof the synthesis cross sections.\nIn the last decade the mass tables of M\u00f6ller et al. [19] have most frequently been used in the field of superheavy\nnuclei. Unfortunately, fission barriers heights are not given in these tables. Therefore, in most of the mentioned above\ncalculations of the synthesis cross sections the ground-state shell effect of the compound nucleus (that is listed in\nthese tables) was used as the barrier height. In this simplification, both the macroscopic deformation energy and the\nshell effect at the saddle configuration are neglected. It seems, therefore, that these approximate values of the fission\nbarrier are not sufficiently accurate to guarantee reliable predictions of the synthesis cross sections. (Absolute value\nof both these neglected effects may be of about 1\u20132 MeV each, while a 1 MeV-shift of the barrier height may result\nin a change of the calculated cross section of 3n or 4n reaction by 2\u20133 orders of magnitude.)\nOnly in recent years systematic compilations of theoretical fission barriers of superheavy nuclei (combined with the\nnecessary information on the ground-state masses) have became available in literature. Calculations in framework of\nthe macro-microscopic approach were reported by Muntian et al. [20] and later by M\u00f6ller at al. [21]. The model [20]\nhas been extended recently by Kowal et al. [22, 23] by the inclusion of nonaxiality as an important new degree of\nfreedom. Fission barriers of superheavy nuclei have been calculated also in a number of other papers within various\nmodels (see Ref. [24], Table IV for a review), however no sufficiently systematic information on the fission barriers\nand, simultaneously, ground-state masses has been provided.\nIn the present study we adopt the \"fusion-by-diffusion\" (FBD) model [8, 9] for calculating the synthesis cross\nsections of the heaviest nuclei in hot fusion (xn) reactions by using the information on the fission-barrier heights\n[22, 23] and other properties of the superheavy nuclei obtained within the Warsaw macroscopic-microscopic model\n[20].\nThe whole set of experimental data [3, 25\u201335] on the synthesis of new superheavy elements of Z = 114\u2013118\n(obtained in Dubna by Oganessian and coworkers and later in a series of confirming experiments at GSI Darmstadt\nand LBNL Berkeley) was analyzed. Based on this test of the model predictions, the calculations were then performed\nfor experimentally unexplored yet reactions aimed at the synthesis of new elements of Z = 119 and 120.\nII.\n\nREVIEW OF THE FBD MODEL\n\nThe fusion-by-diffusion (FBD) model [8, 9] serves for calculating cross sections for the synthesis of superheavy\nnuclei. Recently the model was modified in order to describe both cold fusion (1n) and hot fusion (xn) reactions.\nIn this extended version [9], for each angular momentum l the partial evaporation-residue cross section \u03c3ER (l) for\nproduction of a given final nucleus in its ground state is factorized as the product of the partial capture cross section\n\u03c3cap (l) = \u03c0\u03bb2 (2l + 1)T (l), the fusion probability Pf us (l) and the survival probability Psurv (l):\n\u03c3ER = \u03c0\u03bb2\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n(2l + 1)T (l) * Pf us (l) * Psurv (l).\n\n(1)\n\nl=0\n\nThe capture transmission coefficients T (l) are calculated in a simple sharp cut-off approximation, where the upper limit\nlmax of full transmission, T (l) = 1, is determined by the capture cross section known from the systematics described\nin Refs. [9, 36]. Here \u03bb is the wave length, \u03bb2 = h\u03042 /2\u03bcEc.m. , and \u03bc is the reduced mass of the colliding system.\nThe fusion probability Pf us (l) is the probability that the colliding system, after reaching the capture configuration\n(sticking), will eventually overcome the saddle point and fuse, thus avoiding reseparation. The other factor in Eq.\n(1), the survival probability Psurv (l), is the probability for the compound nucleus to decay to the ground state of the\nfinal residual nucleus via evaporation of light particles and \u03b3 rays, thus avoiding fission.\nThe cross sections for the synthesis of superheavy nuclei are dramatically small because the fusion probability Pf us (l)\nis hindered (in some reactions even by several orders of magnitude) due to the fact that the saddle configuration of\nthe heaviest compound nuclei is much more compact than the configuration of two colliding nuclei at sticking. It\nis assumed in the FBD model that after the contact of the two nuclei, a neck between them grows rapidly at an\n\n\f3\napproximately fixed mass asymmetry and constant length of the system. This \"neck zip\" is expected to carry the\nsystem towards the bottom of the asymmetric fission valley. This is the \"injection point\", from where the system starts\nits climb uphill over the saddle in the process of thermal fluctuations in the shape degrees of freedom. Theoretical\njustification of the above picture of fast zipping the neck was given in Ref. [37], where the later stage of the stochastic\nclimb uphill was described by solving the two-dimensional Langevin equation. Theoretical location of an effective\ninjection point can be deduced from this model [37]. Also in a modified fusion-by-diffusion model [38] the location\nof the injection point was estimated theoretically. In our model we rely, however, on empirical determination of the\ninjection point. Its location in the asymmetric fission valley, sinj , is the only adjustable parameter of the FBD model.\nBy solving the Smoluchowski diffusion equation, it was shown in Ref. [39] that the probability of overcoming a\nparabolic barrier for the system injected on the outside of the saddle point at an energy H below the saddle is:\nPf us =\n\np\n1\n(1 \u2212 erf H/T ),\n2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere T is the temperature of the fusing system. The energy threshold H opposing fusion in the diffusion process\nis thus the difference between the energy of the saddle point Esaddle and the energy of the combined system at the\ninjection point Einj , where Einj is calculated using algebraic expressions given in Ref. [9] which approximate the\npotential energy surface along the fission valley. The energy of the saddle point is given by the adopted theoretical\nvalue of the fission barrier Bf and the ground-state energy of the compound nucleus. The corresponding values of\nthe rotational energy at the injection point and at the symmetric saddle point are calculated assuming the rigid-body\nmoments of inertia at these configurations [9].\nAs regards the survival probability Psurv , the standard statistical-model calculation were done by applying the\nWeisskopf formula for the particle (neutron) emission width \u0393n , and the conventional expression of the transitionstate theory for the fission width \u0393f . The level density parameters an and af for neutron evaporation and fission\nchannels were calculated as proposed by Reisdorf [40], with shell effects accounted for by the Ignatyuk formula [41].\nAll details regarding the calculations of the survival probability Psurv can be found in our recent paper [9]. In case of\ncalculating multiple evaporation (xn) channels a simplified algorithm avoiding the necessity of using the Monte Carlo\nmethod was applied [42].\nIII.\n\nCALCULATIONS FOR Z=114-120 ELEMENTS WITH THE MACROSCOPIC-MICROSCOPIC\nBARRIERS\n\nAs pointed out in the Introduction, calculations of the cross sections for synthesis of superheavy nuclei are extremely\nsensitive to the height of the fission barrier, especially in case of \"hot fusion\" reactions because at each step of\ndeexcitation cascade the competition between neutron emission and fission strongly depends on the difference of\nenergy thresholds for these two decay modes. Therefore, in attempts to reasonably calculate the synthesis cross\nsections, the choice of realistic and consistent theoretical information on the fission barrier heights and the groundstate masses is essential. In our previous applications of the FBD model, devoted mostly to analysis of cold fusion\nreactions (of Z of the compound nucleus ZCN \u2264 113), fission barriers based on the Thomas-Fermi model [43] were\nused. In Ref. [45] it was observed, however, that for heavier nuclei of ZCN \u2265 114 produced in hot fusion reactions\nthe fission barriers based on the Thomas-Fermi model are evidently too high, while barriers based on the Warsaw\nmacroscopic-microscopic model [20] lead to better agreement with experimental observations. Therefore results of\nthe new macroscopic-microscopic calculations of the Warsaw group [22], involving an extended multi-dimensional\ndeformation space, have been chosen as the saddle-point and ground-state input to the FBD model. The published\n[22] results for even-even nuclei have been supplemented with unpublished yet results for odd-Z and/or odd-N nuclei\n[23].\nIn the first stage of calculations a complete set of experimental data [3, 25\u201335] on the synthesis of Z=114-118\nelements in reactions induced by 48 Ca projectiles on 242,244 Pu, 243 Am, 245,248 Cm, 249 Bk and 249 Cf targets was analyzed\nwith the aim to determine location of the injection point sinj . Here sinj is defined as the excess of the total length of\nthe combined system over the length of the initial system (at the touching configuration) when the neck-zip process\nbrings the system to the asymmetric fission valley.\nIn order to determine systematics of sinj for the set of hot fusion reactions [3, 25\u201335], the individual values of sinj\nwere deduced for each reaction and each particular xn channel by adjusting the assumed sinj -value to the experimental\nsynthesis cross section at the maximum of a given xn excitation function. The compilation of so deduced sinj -values\nis displayed in Fig. 1 as a function of the kinetic energy excess Ec.m. \u2212 B0 above the Coulomb barrier B0 . (For the\ndefinition of B0 see Ref. [9].)\nIt should be commented here that values of sinj are inferred from the synthesis cross sections in a model-dependent\nway, assuming particular ground-state masses and fission barriers. Therefore the result of this procedure obviously\n\n\f4\ndepends to some extent on these theoretical input data used in the calculations. Consequently, the systematics of sinj\nobtained in calculations employing different sources of the theoretical input data may appear different (cf. the sinj\nsystematics obtained in recent calculations of cold fusion reactions [9] analyzed assuming masses and fission barriers\nbased on the Thomas-Fermi model [43]).\nIt is clearly seen from Fig. 1 that the injection distance sinj increases with the decreasing energy Ec.m. \u2212 B0 , in\nagreement with expectations based on the dynamics of nucleus-nucleus collisions, for example the classical trajectory\ncalculations [44]. Very good correlation between the sinj -values and the corresponding energies Ec.m. \u2212 B0 can be\nviewed as an argument in favor of the fission barriers of Kowal et al. [22, 23] because such a striking correlation would\nbe very unlikely if the theoretical barrier heights were inconsistent with experimental values.\nA linear fit to the dependence of sinj on Ec.m. \u2212 B0 in Fig. 1,\nsinj \u2248 4.09 fm \u2212 0.192(Ec.m. \u2212 B0 ) fm/MeV,\n\n(3)\n\nrepresents the only empirical input to our model and once this systematics of the injection-point distance is determined\nin form of Eq. (3), one can use the FBD model to calculate excitation functions of fusion-evaporation reactions without\nany adjustable parameters.\nIn Fig. 2 we present a comparison of our FBD model predictions of excitation functions for different xn channels\nwith experimental synthesis cross sections (assigned to the corresponding xn channels) in the following hot fusion\nreactions: 244 Pu(48 Ca,xn)292\u2212x 114 [3, 26, 27, 31, 34], 243 Am(48 Ca,xn)291\u2212x 115 [3, 25, 35], 245 Cm(48 Ca,xn)293\u2212x 116\n[3, 26], 248 Cm(48 Ca,xn)296\u2212x 116 [3, 27, 33], 249 Bk(48 Ca,xn)297\u2212x 117 [30] and 249 Cf(48 Ca,xn)297\u2212x 118 [3, 28]. The\nlargest deviations of our general fit to the data approach a factor of 10 that corresponds effectively to a difference\nof about 0.5 MeV in the assumed height of the theoretical fission barrier. Given this high sensitivity of the model\npredictions to the assumed fission barrier heights, the overall agreement between the FBD predictions and measured\ncross sections is quite satisfactory. (It is rather unlikely that the accuracy of the theoretical predictions of individual\nfission barriers might be much better than \u00b10.5 MeV.)\nIt is instructive to compare results of calculations presented in Figs. 1 and 2 with predictions for an alternative\nset of theoretical fission barriers. In Fig. 3 we present individual values of the injection distance sinj deduced for\nthe same set of data on hot fusion reactions [3, 25\u201335], but obtained assuming fission barriers of M\u00f6ller et al. [21],\nthe only alternative, complete set of necessary information available in literature. The barriers of M\u00f6ller et al. are\nconsiderably higher than barriers of Kowal et al. [22, 23], thus resulting in larger values of the calculated survival\nprobability Psurv . Consequently, the procedure of \"calibrating\" the individual sinj values by fitting the predictions\nto experimental cross sections resulted in larger values of the determined injection distance sinj . Contrary to the\nconsistent systematics of sinj values shown in Fig. 1, Fig. 3 demonstrates the evident inconsistency of the set of sinj\nvalues obtained for the barriers of Ref. [21]. It is seen from Fig. 3 that the sinj values range from 5.5 fm to 8.5 fm\nand are too large to have a reasonable physical meaning. (In most cases, they correspond to the injection distance\nthat exceeds the distance of the scission configuration.) Most importantly, the individual points in Fig. 3 seam to be\nalmost randomly scattered and do not show any correlation with energy.\nThere is one more inconsistency that can be noticed when the fission barriers of Ref. [21] and the ground-state\nmasses [19] are used. Namely, for these high fission barriers and corresponding Q-values, the predicted positions of\nthe maxima of the xn excitation functions are shifted by some 5\u20137 MeV toward lower energies as compared with the\ndata (and also with respect to the predictions for barriers of Ref. [22, 23]). This effect is illustrated in Fig. 4, where\nthe data for 3n and 4n channels in the 243 Am(48 Ca,xn)291\u2212x 115 reaction are compared with the excitation functions\ncalculated for these two reaction channels. This considerable energy shift, seen also for other reactions, stems from\nthe fact that for the M\u00f6ller's barriers [21] and the corresponding ground-state masses [19], the fission barrier Bf is\nlarger than the neutron binding energy Bn for all the compound nuclei formed in the studied reactions. Consequently,\nthe \u0393n /\u0393f ratio rises very fast at low excitation energies thus influencing the position and shape of the xn excitation\nfunctions.\nFrom Figs. 1 and 2 it is seen that contrary to the generally higher fission barriers of Ref. [21], the input data of\nKowal et al. [22, 23] give a reasonable agreement of the calculated and measured cross sections as well as the very\nclear correlation between sinj and Ec.m. \u2212 B0 that \"calibrates\" the injection distance sinj . This entitles us to believe\nthat the set of theoretical fission-barrier heights and ground-state masses [22, 23] is quite adequate for a wide range\nof the heaviest nuclei considered in this study. Therefore we are going to use them for predictions of cross sections of\nyet unexplored reactions aimed at the synthesis of new elements Z = 119 and 120.\nRegarding possibilities to produce the element Z = 119 we consider, first of all, the most preferred reactions induced\nby the favorable beam of 48 Ca on two isotopes of einsteinium, 252 Es and 254 Es. These extremely difficult-to-produce\ntargets might possibly be available in the near future. Therefore we present in Figs. 5(a) and 5(b) the predicted\nenergy dependence of the xn cross sections in reactions on these two isotopes. The largest cross section, which turns\nout to be at the edge of experimental possibilities (about 0.2 pb in 4n channel at Ec.m. \u2248 220 MeV), is predicted for\nthe 252 Es(48 Ca,xn)300\u2212x 119 reaction. Surprisingly, the cross section in the reaction on a more neutron-rich target,\n\n\f5\n254\n\nEs(48 Ca,xn)302\u2212x 119, is by one order of magnitude lower (only about 15 fb). This is a consequence of lower fission\nbarriers [22, 23] in the chain of subsequent neutron-emitting nuclei, Bf = 4.87 MeV, 4.98 MeV, 5.77 MeV in 302 119,\n301\n119 and 300 119, while in a chain of neutron decays starting from the 300 119 nucleus, the predicted fission barriers are\n5.77 MeV, 5.55 MeV and 6.03 MeV, respectively. Very recently Zagrebaev et al. [16] have reported a prediction for the\nsame reaction, 254 Es(48 Ca,xn)302\u2212x 119 (about 0.3 pb for 3n channel). No prediction for the 252 Es(48 Ca,xn)300\u2212x 119\nreaction was given.\nIn case of inaccessibility of Es targets, the most promising target-projectile combination to synthesize the element\nZ = 119 is the 249 Bk(50 Ti,xn)299\u2212x 119 reaction. Predictions for this reaction are shown in Fig. 5(c). Both 3n and\n4n channels are expected to have comparable cross sections of about 30 fb (at maximum) at Ec.m. \u2248 225 and 232\nMeV, respectively. Almost an equally small cross section for the 249 Bk(50 Ti,xn)299\u2212x 119 reaction (about 60 fb) was\npredicted in Ref. [5], and somewhat larger value (about 110 fb) in Ref. [17]. Unfortunately, such small cross sections\nseem to be beyond the reach of present-state experiments. More optimistic predictions for the same reaction appeared\nrecently in Ref. [15], however a relatively large cross section (about 0.6 pb) was obtained for probably overestimated\nvalues of the fission barrier taken as the pure ground-state shell effect from tables of Ref. [19].\nProspects for the synthesis of element Z = 120 are considerably worse than those for Z = 119. First of all, there\nis no chance to use the favorable beam of 48 Ca because the complementary 257 Fm target cannot be produced. We\nconsider therefore reactions with 50 Ti beam on two available isotopes of californium, 249 Cf(50 Ti,xn)299\u2212x 120 and\n251\nCf(50 Ti,xn)301\u2212x 120, which seem to be best choice. Excitation functions for these two reactions are shown in Figs.\n5(d) and 5(e). The largest cross section is expected in the former reaction (about 6 fb at maximum in both 3n and 4n\nchannels), in the latter reaction the maximum cross section is about 3 fb for 4n channel. Again, similarly as in case\nof reactions on two isotopes of einsteinium discussed above, a smaller cross section for more neutron rich compound\nnucleus is associated with respectively lower fission barriers predicted in Refs. [22, 23].\nIn Fig. 5(f) we present results of calculations for the 248 Cm(54 Cr,xn)302\u2212x 120 reaction that is a more symmetric\ncombination of even-Z target and projectile, next to Ti + Cf. The obtained cross sections of the order of 1 fb for\n3n and 4n reaction channels clearly demonstrate that fusion processes are too strongly hindered in more symmetric\nsystems. For completeness, we calculated also cross sections in two reactions of much more symmetric systems,\n238\nU(64 Ni,xn)302\u2212x 120 and 244 Pu(58 Fe,xn)302\u2212x 120 (not shown in figures), for which attempts to produce the element\nZ = 120 were done [46], [47]. The calculated 3n and 4n cross sections in these two reactions are dramatically small,\nabout 0.3 fb and 0.1 fb, respectively. Note that experimental upper limits for these two reactions had been established\nat 90 fb [46] and 400 fb [47], respectively.\nOur calculations show that if the fission barriers of Refs. [22, 23] were correct, there is no chance to synthesize the\nelement Z = 120, even in the most favorable reaction 249 Cf(50 Ti,xn)299\u2212x 120, for which the predicted cross section is\nonly 6 fb. Note that other model calculations for the 249 Cf(50 Ti,xn)299\u2212x 120 reaction, published previously [5, 10, 12\u2013\n14, 17], predicted considerably larger cross sections though also too small to be measurable (typically of the order of\n50 fb). The dispersion of these different theoretical results has to be linked, first of all, to different fission barriers\nand ground-state masses used in these calculations.\nWe would like to emphasize that our predictions concerning the synthesis of Z = 119 and 120 nuclei are based on the\nconsistency of the FBD model calculations with the adopted ground-state masses and fission barriers of Refs. [22, 23]\nand with all the existing experimental data on the synthesis of superheavy nuclei in hot fusion reactions [3, 25\u201335].\nTherefore the accuracy of these predictions is expected to be comparable with the accuracy of our overall fit to the\ndata for the synthesis of Z = 114\u2013118 nuclei, shown in Fig. 2.\nIn summary, we analyzed a complete set of existing data on hot fusion reactions leading to the synthesis of superheavy nuclei of Z =114-118 [3, 25\u201335] in terms of a new l-dependent version of the FBD model with fission barriers\nand ground-state masses taken from the macroscopic-microscopic model of Kowal et al. [22, 23]. By \"calibrating\"\nthe assumed injection-point distances (sinj ) to the measured cross sections, perfect systematics of sinj -values have\nbeen established for a wide range of hot fusion reactions enabling, hopefully, reliable predictions of the synthesis cross\nsections for yet unexplored reactions. Regarding prospects to produce the new element Z = 119, our calculations\nprefer the 252 Es(48 Ca,xn)300\u2212x 119 reaction, for which the synthesis cross section of about 0.2 pb in 4n channel at\nEc.m. \u2248 220 MeV is expected. According to the microscopic-macroscopic model predictions [22, 23], fission barriers\nfor heavier isotopes of the element Z = 119 are significantly lower leading to a considerably smaller cross section in\nthe alternative 254 Es(48 Ca,xn)302\u2212x 119 reaction. Also the reaction 249 Bk(50 Ti,xn)299\u2212x 119 gives little chances for a\nmeasurable cross section (the predicted cross section is about 30 fb for both 3n and 4n channels). The most favorable\nreaction to synthesize the element Z = 120 is the 249 Cf(50 Ti,xn)299\u2212x 120 reaction, but the predicted cross section is\n\n\f6\nonly 6 fb (for 3n and 4n channels).\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n[22]\n[23]\n[24]\n[25]\n[26]\n[27]\n[28]\n[29]\n[30]\n[31]\n[32]\n[33]\n[34]\n[35]\n[36]\n[37]\n[38]\n[39]\n[40]\n[41]\n[42]\n[43]\n[44]\n[45]\n[46]\n[47]\n\nS.
