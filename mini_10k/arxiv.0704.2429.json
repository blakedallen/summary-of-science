In the Abelian case, the\ninvariants obtained are the Self-Linking Number or the Gauss Linking Number (GLN), depending on whether one\ndeals with one or several Wilson lines. In the non-Abelian case, on the other hand, the invariants obtained are known\nto be knot or link polynomials, such as the celebrated Jones polynomial [16]. Which polynomial appears depends on\nthe gauge group involved [6].\nThe GLN of a pair of closed curves admits an analytical expression (see equation 12) that has a simple and appealing\ngeometric interpretation: it represents the oriented number of times that one of the curves flows through a surface\nbounded by the other one. However, to obtain analytical expressions in the non-Abelian case, one must resort to\na perturbative expansion of the v.e.v. of the WLs [5], since as far as it is known, polynomial invariants are not\nexpressible in analytical terms. This perturbative expansion yields an infinite tower of analytical expressions for LIs\nof increasing complexity. In general, it is not easy to elucidate their geometric or topological meaning, however,\nthe first three of them have been explicitly calculated, and in some cases, a geometrical interpretation is available\n[2, 5, 6, 7, 9, 12, 15].\nA question that naturally rises is about the existence of an intermediate situation between the Abelian and nonAbelian cases. Stated more precisely: is there any topological field theory, other than the Abelian CS (or the Abelian\nBF theory) that yields exact analytical expressions for LIs, other than the GLN?.\nBeyond the theoretical interest that this question could have, there is an increasing interest in the description of\nphenomena that involve closed lines as relevant structures (vortices and defects in condensed matter or fundamental\nphysics, loops in gauge theories and quantum gravity, polymer entanglements, among others examples). Therefore, it\ncould be useful to have at one's disposal new topological theories, that while going beyond the Abelian Chern-Simons\nTheory and its associated GLN, do not present the difficulties of the non-Abelian ones.\nThe purpose of this paper is to provide an example of such a theory. As we shall see, the LI that the theory we are\ngoing to consider produces is the Milnor's Linking Coefficient \u03bc(1, 2, 3) , which is an invariant associated to links of at\nleast three-components. This invariant follows the GLN in an infinite family of link invariants discovered by Milnor\nseveral decades ago [13].\nThe theory that we shall study can be seen as an effective Abelian gauge and diffeomorphism invariant theory, that\nreproduces just the second contribution of the perturbative expansion of a non-Abelian topological one, namely, of the\nCS model coupled to chromo-electrically charged particles (so called 'Wong particles' [17]). This Chern-Simons-Wong\nmodel has been recently studied from a classical point of view [7, 9].\nThe action that we are going to deal with comprises a pure gauge-fields part, and terms representing the coupling of\nthese fields with external sources with support on closed curves. The terms that correspond to the gauge-field's part\ncoincide with those of a recent article [4] that studies Chern-Simons theories with non-semisimple group of symmetry.\nHowever, in contrast with reference [4], the interaction term that we take is manifestly diffeomorphism invariant, and\nbreaks the non-Abelian gauge invariance of the former term down to an Abelian gauge invariance (see equations (10)\nand (14)).\nIn the discussion that follows, we shall adopt the method of dealing with the classical (in the sense of non- quantummechanical) theory to calculate LIs [7, 8, 9]. Within this scheme, one solves the equation of motion and calculates\nthe on-shell (OS) action of the topological theory coupled to external Wilson lines. The OS action results to be\na functional depending on the Wilson lines that act as sources of the gauge theory and, since the theory is metric\nindependent, it is clearly a LI. For instance, when this procedure is applied to the Abelian CS theory coupled to\n\n\f2\nWilson lines, the OS action yields the GLN of the lines, just as in the quantum case. This approach for obtaining\nLIs from classical field theories can be rigorously proven and generalized to situations where the symmetry group is\nother than the group of diffeomorphisms of the base manifold [10, 11]. Although we shall focus mainly in this classical\napproach, we shall also make some remarks about the \"quantum method\", which is the procedure usually employed\nto study the relation between LIs and topological theories.\nII.\n\nTHE ACTION AND THE LINK INVARIANT\n\nThe action that we shall study is given by\nZ\nZ\n\b\n2\nS =\nd3 x \u03b5\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 4 Ai\u03bc (x)\u2202\u03bd ai\u03c1 (x) + \u03b5ijk ai\u03bc (x)aj\u03bd (x)ak\u03c1 (x) \u2212 2 d3 x Ti\u03bcx Ai\u03bc (x) +\n3\nZ\nZ\n+ d3 x\nd3 y \u03b5ijk Ti\u03bcx,\u03bdy aj\u03bc (x)ak\u03bd (y).\n\n(1)\n\nHere, Ai\u03bc (x) and ai\u03bc (x) are two sets of independent Abelian gauge fields, labelled by Latin letters running from 1\nto 3 (we use the summation convention of Einstein also for these \"internal\" indexes). The first two terms would\ncorrespond to the topological theory with non-semisimple gauge group of symmetry introduced in reference [4].

As we shall see, the presence of the second\n\"loop-coordinate\" T\u03b3\u03bcx, \u03bdy is just what will lead us to obtain a LI beyond the GLN, which only depends on the first\n\"loop-coordinate\" T\u03b3\u03bcy .\nVarying the action (1) with respect to Ai\u03bc and ai\u03bc yields\n\n\u03b5\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 \u2202\u03bd ai\u03c1 =\n\n\u03b5\n\n\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\n\n\u2202\u03bd Ai\u03c1 (x)\n\n1 \u03bcx\nT ,\n2 i\n\n1\n1\n= \u2212 \u03b5\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 \u03b5ijk aj\u03bd (x)ak\u03c1 (x) +\n2\n2\n\n(8)\nZ\n\n[\u03bcx,\u03bdy]\n\nd3 y \u03b5ijk Tj\n\nak\u03bd (y).\n\n(9)\n\nThese equations are just the 0\u2212th and first order contributions to the SU (2) Chern-Simons-Wong equations of motion\nthat were studied in references [7, 9]. In that approach, the fields Ai\u03bc and ai\u03bc correspond, respectively, to the first and\n0 \u2212 th contributions of a perturbative expansion for the non-Abelian potential [7, 9].\n\n\f3\nis divergenceless, equation (8) is consistent. This reflects the invariance of the action under the gauge\nSince T\u03b3\u03bcy\ni\ntransformations\nAi\u03bc \u2212\u2192 Ai\u03bc + \u2202\u03bc \u039bi .\n\n(10)\n\nThe consistency of equation (9) is more involved. Taking the divergence of both sides of this equation yields\nZ\n\u2202 [\u03bcx,\u03bdy]\n.\n0 = 2\u03b5\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 \u03b5ijk \u2202\u03bc (aj\u03bd (x)ak\u03c1 (x)) \u2212 \u03b5ijk d3 y ak\u03bd (y) \u03bc Tj\n\u2202x\n\n(11)\n\nUsing the differential constraints (6) and the equation of motion (8), we obtain\nI\nI\n(x \u2212 z)\u03b1\n= \u03b5ijk \u03b4 3 (x \u2212 xj (0))L(j, k) = 0,\n\u03b5ijk \u03b4 3 (x \u2212 xj (0)) dx\u03bd\ndz \u03b2 \u03b5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2\n|x \u2212 z|3\nj\nk\nwere\n1\nL(i, j) =\n4\u03c0\n\nI\n\n\u03b3i\n\ndzi\u03b2\n\nI\n\n\u03b3j\n\ndyj\u03bc \u03b5\u03bc\u03b2\u03b3\n\n(z \u2212 y)\u03b3\n,\n|z \u2212 y|3\n\n(12)\n\nis the GLN between the curves \u03b3i and \u03b3j . In the case where these curves do not intersect each other, equation (12)\ndemands that\nL(i, j) = 0 \u2200 i, j.\n\n(13)\n\nFrom this result we obtain that the theory is consistent whenever the curves are not linked in the sense of the GLN.\nThis does not mean that the curves are equivalent to the trivial link (the unlink). For instance, the Borromean Rings\nare a well known set of three curves whose GLNs vanish, although they are indeed entangled [14]. There are more\ncomplex entanglement patterns associated with CS theory than those measured by the GLN.\nThe consistency condition (13) is also related to a gauge symmetry of the theory. A direct calculation shows that\nthe action (1) is invariant under the transformations\nai\u03bc \u2192 ai\u03bc + \u2202\u03bc \u03a9i ,\n\n(14)\n\nprovided that the consistency condition (13) is fulfilled. Thus, we see that both sets of fields Ai and ai must be\nAbelian gauge fields for the theory to be consistent.\nOn the other hand, there is no need of introducing a metric in the manifold to construct the action, as can be easily\nverified. Hence, the theory is metric independent. Since it is also generally covariant, it is a topological theory, just\nlike its cousins the Abelian and non-Abelian Chern-Simons theories. Hence, following references [7, 8, 9], we conclude\nthat the on-shell action Sos of the theory should only depend on topological features of the curves appearing in the\naction, i.e., it should be a link invariant. Let us see how this happens.\nThe solution of equation (8) is given by\n\u00101\u0011 1 I\n(x \u2212 z)\u03bd\nai\u03bc (x) = \u2212\n.\n(15)\ndz \u03c1 \u03b5\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\n2 4\u03c0 \u03b3i\n|x \u2212 z|3\nEquation (9) can also be integrated as easily as the former one, but in order to calculate Sos it suffices to substitute\nthe left hand side of (9) and expression (15) into (1). The result is then\n1\n2\n\nZ\n\n1\n2\n\nZ\n\u0010\n[\u03bcx,\u03bdy]\nd3 x\nd3 y T1\na2\u03bc (x)a3\u03bd (y)+\n\u0011\n[\u03bcx,\u03bdy]\n[\u03bcx,\u03bdy]\n+T2\na3\u03bc (x)a1\u03bd (y) + T3\na1\u03bc (x)a2\u03bd (y) .\n\nS (1) (1, 2, 3) = \u2212\n\nd3 x \u03b5\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 a1\u03bc (x)a2\u03bd (x)a3\u03c1 (x) \u2212\n\nZ\n\n(16)\n\nEquation (16) corresponds to an analytical expression for the Milnor's Linking Coefficient \u03bc(1, 2, 3) [13]. In [9] it\nwas shown by explicit calculation that this expression, despite its appearance, is metric independent, as it should be.\nAn interpretation of its geometrical meaning can be found in references [9, 12].\nA sketch of the interpretation of this result would be as follows: the first term in equation (16) measures how\nmany times three arbitrary surfaces whose boundaries are the three curves of the theory (known as Seifert surfaces\n\n\f4\n[14]) intersect at a common point. The second term counts the oriented number of times that one of the curves\ncrosses first the surface bounded by the second curve and then the surface bounded by the last one. The fact that\nexpression (16) keeps memory of the order in which each curve flows through the surfaces attached to the other curves\nis what distinguishes this invariant from the GLN. This feature makes \u03bc(1, 2, 3) a natural \"next level\" of complexity\nLI when compared to the GLN. Obviously, further developments along these lines might provide even more (and more\ninteresting) link invariants.\nTo conclude let us briefly discuss the quantum formulation of the theory, within the Feynman path-integral framework. We consider the functional integral\n\nW (\u03b3i ) =\n\nZ\n\nDA\n\nZ\n\nDa exp (\u2212S).\n\n(17)\n\nIt should be noticed that action (1) already depends on the \"Wilson lines\" \u03b3i . This dependence is mandatory to\npreserve the Abelian gauge-invariance given by (10) and (14). This contrasts with what occurs in the usual Abelian\nChern-Simons theory and the non-Abelian one, where gauge invariance does not demand the coupling with external\nWilson lines. Integrating out the fields A produces a functional \"delta function\"\nZ\nnZ\no\n\b\nDA exp\n\u221d \u03b4[4 \u03b5\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 \u2202\u03bd ai\u03c1 (x) \u2212 2Ti\u03bcx ],\n(18)\nd3 x Ai\u03bc (x) 4 \u03b5\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 \u2202\u03bd ai\u03c1 (x) \u2212 2Ti\u03bcx\nthat when substituted into (17) enforces the a fields to take their on-shell values given by (15). Hence, the result is\nW (\u03b3i ) = C exp(Sos ),\n\n(19)\n\nwhere C is a constant and Sos is the link invariant given in equation (16).\nIn the preceding discussion we have ignored that, indeed, gauge invariance leads to infinities in the Feynman pathintegrals that should be properly handled. This can be done, for instance, by employing the Faddeev-Popov method\n[3] in the usual way. The result still is given by (19), as can be readily checked.\nSummarizing, we have presented a topological model that \"interpolates\" between Abelian and Non-Abelian ChernSimons theory, in the sense that it leads to a link invariant that goes beyond the GLN yielded by the Abelian theory,\nbut otherwise retaining the property of being an exactly soluble model, unlike the non-Abelian one. The link invariant\nso obtained corresponds to the Milnor linking coefficient \u03bc(1, 2, 3).\nThis work was supported by Proyect PI 03-00-6316-2006 of Consejo de Desarrollo Cient\u0131\u0301fico y Human\u0131\u0301stico, Universidad Central de Venezuela, Caracas, VENEZUELA, and by Project G-2001000712 of FONACIT, VENEZUELA.\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n\nA.P.
