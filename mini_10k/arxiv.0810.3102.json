In this paper, some results on vanishing and non-vanishing of generalized local cohomology modules are presented and some relations between those modules and, Ext and ordinary\nlocal cohomology modules are studied. Also, several cofiniteness propositions for generalized local\ncohomology modules are established which, among other things, provide an alternative answer to\na question in [Y2].\n\n1. Introduction\nThe notion of generalized local cohomology was first introduced by J. Herzog in his habilitationss\n[H] and then continued by N. Suzuki [S], S. Yassemi [Y] and some other authors. They studied some\nbasic duality theorems, vanishing and other properties of generalized local cohomology modules\nwhich also generalize several known facts about Ext and ordinary local cohomolgy modules.\nThroughout the paper, R is a commutative Noetherian ring with identity, a is an ideal of R. For\neach i \u2265 0, the generalized local cohomology functor Hai (\u2212, \u2212) is defined, for all R-modules M and\nN , by\nHai (M, N ) = lim\nExtiR (M/an M, N ).\n\u2212\u2192\nn\n\nIn section 2, we study the vanishing and non-vanishing of generalized local cohomology modules.\nThe crucial point is Theorem 2.2 which is interesting in itself as it provides a vanishing proposition\nfor Ext and ordinary local cohomology modules. Then Proposition 2.3 and Corollary 2.4 show\nwhat implied from this theorem about vanishing and non-vanishing of generalized local cohomology\nmodules. In Proposition 2.6, we extend Theorem 2.2 for Artinian property of local cohomology\nmodules which gives a new proof for [Mel; Theorem 5.5]. Finally, in this section, Proposition 2.8\nshows how the generalized local cohomology modules behave sharply at the non-vanishing bounds\nfor Ext and local cohomology modules. We also apply this proposition in section 3.\nIn section 3, we study the cofiniteness property of generalized local cohomology modules. In\nthe first proposition we show that for finite R-modules M and N with pd(M ) < \u221e, the R-module\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 13D45, 14B15.\nKey words and phrases.

Mafi [M; Theorem 2.9], but also a-\n\ncofinite. Then in Proposition 3.4 we generalize [Mel; Corollary 2.5] for a Serre subcategory of\nthe category of R-modules. Furthermore we generalize and give a new proof to [Mel; Corollary\n3.14] for arbitrary R-modules in Proposition 3.5. These two propositions can also be employed to\nprove Proposition 3.6 which presents some finite generalized local cohomology modules. The main\ntheorem of section 3 is Theorem 3.7 which provides some sufficient conditions for generalized local\ncohomology modules to be a-cofinite. Even though the assumptions in this theorem are apparently\nstrong, they are practically useful as we can see in the next corollaries which demonstrate some new\nfacts and represent some older facts about a-cofiniteness of generalized local cohomology modules.\n\n2. Vanishing and non-vanishing results\nIn this section, we investigate some basic properties of generalized local cohomology modules.\nMost properties of generalized local cohomology modules inherit from the spectral sequence\nE2p,q := ExtpR (M, Haq (X))=p\u21d2 Hap+q (M, X)\n\n(\u2217)\n\nin particular, when we put this spectral sequence in a double complex. All of the facts in this\nsection can be proved by means of the method that we apply in Theorem 2.2 but to shorten the\nother proofs, we just mention the corresponding spectral sequence's property.\nThe following lemma is an immediate consequence of (\u2217) or can be drawn directly, applying the\nbasic properties of generalized local cohomology such as [DST; Lemma 2.1(i)].\nLemma 2.1. Suppose that M is a finite R-module and that X is an arbitrary R-module. Then\n(i) \u0393a(M, X) = 0 whenever \u0393a(X) = 0.\n(ii) \u0393a(M, X) = Ha1 (M, X) = 0 whenever \u0393a(X) = Ha1 (X) = 0.\nTheorem 2.2. Let X be an arbitrary R-module (not necessarily finite) and t be a positive integer.\nThen the following statements are equivalent:\n(i) Hai (X) = 0 for all 0 \u2264 i < t.\n(ii) ExtiR (R/a, X) = 0 for all 0 \u2264 i < t.\nProof. We prove by using induction on t. Let t = 1. Consider the isomorphism HomR (R/a, X) \u223c\n=\nHomR (R/a, \u0393a(X)); so that we have an equivalent condition that HomR (R/a, X) = 0 if and only\nif \u0393a(X) = 0, since Supp(\u0393a(X)) \u2286 V (a). Hence the assertion holds in this case.\nSuppose that t > 1 and that we have proved the theorem for t \u2212 1 and all R-modules X. Let Y\nbe an R-module and consider the exact sequence\n0 \u2192 Y \u2192 E(Y ) \u2192 L \u2192 0,\n\n\fON VANISHING AND COFINITENESS OF GENERALIZED LOCAL COHOMOLOGY\n\n3\n\nwhere E(Y ) is an injective hull of Y and L is an R-module. Applying the derived functors of\nHomR (R/a, \u2212) and \u0393a(\u2212) to the above short exact sequence, we have exact sequences and isomorphisms:\n0 \u2192 HomR (R/a, Y ) \u2192 HomR (R/a, E(Y )) \u2192 HomR (R/a, L) \u2192 Ext1R (R/a, Y ) \u2192 0,\ni\n\u223c\nExti\u22121\nR (R/a, L) = ExtR (R/a, Y )\n\nfor all i > 1, and\n0 \u2192 \u0393a(Y ) \u2192 \u0393a(E(Y )) \u2192 \u0393a(L) \u2192 Ha1 (Y ) \u2192 0,\nHai\u22121 (L) \u223c\n= Hai (Y )\nfor all i > 1.\nNow, assume that Hai (Y ) = 0 for all 0 \u2264 i < t. Since \u0393a(Y ) = 0, we have \u0393a(E(Y )) = 0 from the\nfact that E(Y ) is an essential extension of Y ; so that HomR (R/a, Y ) \u2286 HomR (R/a, E(Y )) = 0.\nHence we have, by the above isomorphisms and exact sequences, R-isomorphisms:\ni\ni\u22121\n\u223c i\n\u223c\nExti\u22121\nR (R/a, L) = ExtR (R/a, Y ) and Ha (L) = Ha(Y )\n\nfor all i > 0.\nNow, Hai (L) = 0 for all 0 \u2264 i < t \u2212 1 form the latter isomorphisms. Hence ExtiR (R/a, L) = 0\nfor all 0 \u2264 i < t \u2212 1 by the induction hypothesis on L. Again from the above isomorphisms,\nExtiR (R/a, Y ) = 0 for all 0 \u2264 i < t.\nConversely, as the above proof, we see that if ExtiR (R/a, Y ) = 0 for all 0 \u2264 i < t, then Hai (Y ) = 0\nfor all 0 \u2264 i < t. We leave the proof to the reader. The proof is completed.\n\n\u0003\n\nProposition 2.3. Let M be a finitely generated R-module, X be an R-module, and t be a positive\ninteger. If R-module X satisfies the equivalent conditions in Theorem 2.2 for the integer t, then we\nhave\n(i) Hai (M, X) = 0 for all 0 \u2264 i < t.\n(ii) H t (M, X) \u223c\n= HomR (M, H t (X)).\na\n\n(iii)\n\nExttR (R/a, X)\n\na\n\n\u223c\n= HomR (R/a, Hat (X)).\n\nProof. Before beginning the proof, recall that by Da(X) we mean the ideal transform of X with\nHomR (an , X). For the basic definitions and theorems\nrespect to a which is defined by Da(X) := lim\n\u2212\u2192\nn\n\nabout local cohomology and ideal transform we refer the reader to [BS].\nWe use induction on t. Let t = 1. Since \u0393a(X) = 0, \u0393a(M, X) = 0 by Lemma 2.1(i). We\nhave \u0393a(Da(X)) = Ha1 (Da(X)) = 0 by [BS; Corollary 2.2.8(iv)]. Therefore \u0393a(M, Da(X)) =\nHa1 (M, Da(X)) = 0 by Lemma 2.1(ii) and, HomR (R/a, Da(X)) = Ext1R (R/a, Da(X)) = 0 by\nTheorem 2.2; so that the ideal transform sequence 0 \u2192 X \u2192 Da(X) \u2192 Ha1 (X) \u2192 0, yields\nExt1R (R/a, X) \u223c\n= HomR (R/a, Ha1 (X)) and Ha1 (M, X) \u223c\n= \u0393a(M, Ha1 (X)). Now, the latter isomorphisms in conjunction with [YKS; Lemma 1.1] imply the assertion in the case where t = 1.\n\n\f4\n\nS. H. HASSANZADEH AND A. VAHIDI\n\nLet Y be an R-module and t > 1. Also suppose that our claims are satisfied for t \u2212 1 and all\nR-modules X.\nNow, assume that Hai (Y ) = 0 for all 0 \u2264 i < t. Since \u0393a(Y ) = 0, we have \u0393a(E(Y )) = 0 from the\nfact that E(Y ) is an essential extension of Y ; so that \u0393a(M, E(Y )) = 0 by Lemma 2.1(i). Using\nthe exact sequence 0 \u2192 Y \u2192 E(Y ) \u2192 L \u2192 0 as we used in the above theorem and applying the\nderived functors of HomR (R/a, \u2212), \u0393a(M, \u2212) and \u0393a(\u2212) to this short exact sequence, we obtain\nthe isomorphisms:\ni\ni\u22121\ni\u22121\n\u223c\n\u223c i\n\u223c i\nExti\u22121\nR (R/a, L) = ExtR (R/a, Y ) , Ha (M, L) = Ha(M, Y ) and Ha (L) = Ha(Y )\n\nfor all i > 0.\nNow, our assumption on Y and the latter isomorphisms show that, Hai (L) = 0 for all 0 \u2264 i <\nt\u22121\n\u223c\nt \u2212 1. Hence Hat\u22121 (M, L) \u223c\n= HomR (M, Hat\u22121 (L)), Extt\u22121\nR (R/a, L) = HomR (R/a, Ha (L)) and\nHai (M, L) = 0 for all 0 \u2264 i < t \u2212 1 by the induction hypothesis on L. Again from the above\nisomorphisms, we have H t (M, Y ) \u223c\n= HomR (M, H t (Y )), Extt (R/a, Y ) \u223c\n= HomR (R/a, H t (Y )) and\na\n\na\n\nR\n\na\n\nHai (M, Y ) = 0 for all 0 \u2264 i < t, as we desired.\n\n\u0003\n\nThe following corollary can be obtained, by straightforward applications, from Theorem 2.2 and\nProposition 2.3.\nCorollary 2.4. Let M, N be non-zero finite R-modules, X be an arbitrary R-module, and t be a\npositive integer. Then\n(i) (a) Ext1R (R/a, Da(X)) = Ha1 (M, Da(X)) = 0.\n(b) Ext2 (R/a, Da(X)) \u223c\n= HomR (R/a, H 2 (X))\n\na\n2\n2\n\u223c\nand Ha (M, Da(X)) = HomR (M, Ha (X)).\n(c) Ext1R (R/a, X/\u0393a(X)) \u223c\n= HomR (R/a, Ha1 (X))\nand Ha1 (M, X/\u0393a(X)) \u223c\n= HomR (M, Ha1 (X)).\nIf Hai (X) = 0 for all 0 \u2264 i < t, then Hai (M, X) = 0 for all 0 \u2264 i < t.\nIn this case Hat (M, X) 6= 0 if and only if Supp(M ) \u2229 Ass(Hat (X)) 6= \u00d8.\nR\n\n(ii)\n\nt (M, N ) 6= 0.\n(iii) If a maximal ideal m belongs to Supp(M ) and t = grade(m, N ), then Hm\nt (M, N ) 6= 0.\n(iv) (c.f.[S; Theorem 2.3]) If (R, m) is a local ring and t = depth(N ), then Hm\n\nLemma 2.5. Suppose that P is a finite projective R-module and X is an arbitrary R-module. Then\nH i (P, X) \u223c\n= HomR (P, H i (X)) for all i \u2265 0.\na\n\na\n\nProof. This lemma can be proved by using the method implied in Proposition 2.3. It is also an\nimmediate consequence of the spectral sequence\nE2i,j := ExtiR (P, Haj (X))=\u21d2 Hai+j (P, X)\ni\n\nwhere in the corresponding double complex (E2i,j )i\u22650,j\u22650 all of the columns except the first one\nvanish.\n\n\u0003\n\n\fON VANISHING AND COFINITENESS OF GENERALIZED LOCAL COHOMOLOGY\n\n5\n\nIn the course of the remaining parts of the paper for an arbitrary R-module X, by cd(a, X)\n(cohomological dimension of X at a) we mean the largest integer i in which Hai (X) is non-zero.\nAlso pd(X) and dim(X) are denoted as the projective dimension and the Krull dimension of X,\nrespectively. The next proposition shows how Artinian property behaves similarly at the initial\npoints of Ext and at those of ordinary local cohomology modules. This proposition gives a new\nproof for [Mel; Theorem 5.5].\nProposition 2.6. Let X be an arbitrary R-module and t be a positive integer. Then the following\nstatements are equivalent:\n(i) Hai (X) is Artinian for all 0 \u2264 i < t.\n(ii) ExtiR (R/a, X) is Artinian for all 0 \u2264 i < t.\nProof. We prove by induction on t. Considering 0 :X a = 0 :\u0393a (X) a and applying Melkersson's\nTheorem [BS; Theorem 7.1.2], the case where t = 1 is straightforward.\nLet Y be an R-module and t > 1. Also assume that we have proved the claim for t \u2212 1 and all\nR-modules X. Let N = Y /\u0393a(Y ) and L = E(N )/N where E(N ) is an injective hull of N . Since\n\u0393a(N ) = 0, we have \u0393a(E(N )) = 0 from the fact that E(N ) is an essential extension of N . Now\nconsider the exact sequence\n0 \u2192 N \u2192 E(N ) \u2192 L \u2192 0.\nApplying the derived functors of HomR (R/a, \u2212) and \u0393a(\u2212) to the above short exact sequence, we\nhave isomorphisms:\ni\n\u223c\nExti\u22121\nR (R/a, L) = ExtR (R/a, N )\n\nand Hai\u22121 (L) \u223c\n= Hai (N )\n\nfor all i > 0.\nNow, assume that Hai (Y ) is Artinian for all 0 \u2264 i < t. From the latter isomorphisms and [BS;\nCorollary 2.1.7], we have Hai (L) is Artinian for all 0 \u2264 i < t \u2212 1. Hence ExtiR (R/a, L) is Artinian for\nall 0 \u2264 i < t\u22121 by the induction hypothesis on L. Again by the above isomorphisms, ExtiR (R/a, N )\nis Artinian for all 0 \u2264 i < t. Now, the exact sequence 0 \u2192 \u0393a(Y ) \u2192 Y \u2192 N \u2192 0 in conjunction\nwith Artinianness of \u0393a(Y ) show that, ExtiR (R/a, Y ) is Artinian for all 0 \u2264 i < t.\nConversely, as the above proof, we see that if ExtiR (R/a, Y ) is Artinian for all 0 \u2264 i < t, then\nHai (Y ) is Artinian for all 0 \u2264 i < t. We leave the proof to the reader. The proof is completed.\n\n\u0003\n\nProposition 2.7. Let M be a finite R-module with pd(M ) < \u221e, X be an arbitrary R-module, and\nt be a positive integer. If R-module X satisfies the equivalent conditions in Proposition 2.6 for the\ninteger t, then Hai (M, X) is Artinian for all 0 \u2264 i < t.\nProof. We use induction on pd(M ). The case where pd(M ) = 0 yields M \u2295 M \u2032 \u223c\n= Rn for some\nR\u2212module M \u2032 and some integer n. Then, by Lemma 2.5,\nHai (M, X) \u2295 Hai (M \u2032 , X) \u223c\n= HomR (M, Hai (X)) \u2295 HomR (M \u2032 , Hai (X))\n\n\f6\n\nS. H. HASSANZADEH AND A. VAHIDI\n\n\u223c\n= HomR (Rn , Hai (X)) \u223c\n= Hai (X)n\nwhich gives the assertion in this case.\nSuppose that pd(M ) > 0 and that the assertion is true for every finite R-module T with pd(T ) <\npd(M ). Taking the exact sequence 0 \u2192 T \u2192 F \u2192 M \u2192 0, where F is free and T is an R-module,\nwe set the long exact sequence\n* * * \u2192 Hai\u22121 (T, X) \u2192 Hai (M, X) \u2192 Hai (F, X) \u2192 * * *\nwhere by induction hypothesis Hai\u22121 (T, X) and Hai (F, X) are Artinian; so that Hai (M, X) is Artinian\nas desired.\n\n\u0003\n\nThe below proposition can also be proved either by considering the spectral sequence (\u2217) or using\nthe method in Proposition 2.3 based on an induction on cd(a, X).\nProposition 2.8. (compare [Y; Theorem 2.5]) Let M be a finite R-module with pd(M ) < \u221e and\nX be an arbitrary R-module. Then for all i > pd(M ) + cd(a, X), Hai (M, X) = 0 and\npd(M )+cd(a,X)\n\nHa\n\npd(M )\ncd(a,X)\n(M, X) \u223c\n(M, Ha\n(X)).\n= ExtR\n\n3. Cofiniteness results\nIn this section we deal with the cofiniteness property of generalized local cohomology modules.\nRecall that an R-module X is said to be a-cofinite if Supp(X) \u2286 V (a) and either ExtiR (R/a, X) is\nfinite for all i or equally, T oriR (R/a, X) is finite for all i [Mel; Theorem 2.1].\nProposition 3.1. (compare [M; Theorem 2.9)]) Assume that M, N are finite R-modules such that\nt = pd(M ) and d = dim(N ) are finite. Then Hat+d (M, N ) is an a-cofinite Artinian module.\nProof. If cd(a, N ) < d, Hat+d (M, N ) = 0 by Proposition 2.8. Hence suppose that cd(a, N ) = d\nthen we have H t+d (M, N ) \u223c\n= Extt (M, H d (N )), again by Proposition 2.8. Now, according to [Mel;\na\n\nProposition 5.1]\n\nHad (N )\n\nR\n\na\n\nis an a-cofinite Artinian module and also by [Mel; Corollary 4.4] the cate-\n\ngory of a-cofinite Artinian modules is a Serre subcategory of the category of R-modules, i.e. this subcategory is closed under taking subobjects, quotients and extensions. Therefore ExttR (M, Had (N ))\nand hence Hat+d (M, N ) is an a-cofinite Artinian module.\n\n\u0003\n\nNotation 3.2. For an ideal b of R, we denote the category of finite R/b-modules by C f (R/b) and\nthe category of finite R-modules whose support contained in V (b) by C b(R). Also we denote the\ncategory of R-modules by C(R).\nConsidering the fact that each member of C a(R) belongs to C f (R/an ) for some positive integer\nn and appling a straightforward induction on n, we deduce the following useful lemma.\nLemma 3.3. Suppose that T is a middle exact covariant (contravariant) functor from C(R) to\nC(R) and that \u03b4 is a Serre subcategory of C(R). Then T (L) \u2208 \u03b4 for each L \u2208 C a(R) whenever\nT (L) \u2208 \u03b4 for each L \u2208 C f (R/a).\n\n\fON VANISHING AND COFINITENESS OF GENERALIZED LOCAL COHOMOLOGY\n\n7\n\nProposition 3.4. (compare [Mel; Corollary 2.5]) Let X be an arbitrary R-module, t be a nonnegative integer, and \u03b4 be a Serre subcategory of C(R). Suppose b be a second ideal of R contains\na. Then\n(i) If ExtiR (R/a, X) \u2208 \u03b4 for all 0 \u2264 i \u2264 t, then ExtiR (N, X) \u2208 \u03b4 for all 0 \u2264 i \u2264 t and all\nN \u2208 C a(R). In particular, ExtiR (R/b, X) \u2208 \u03b4 for all 0 \u2264 i \u2264 t.\n(ii) If T oriR (R/a, X) \u2208 \u03b4 for all 0 \u2264 i \u2264 t, then T oriR (N, X) \u2208 \u03b4 for all 0 \u2264 i \u2264 t and all\nN \u2208 C a(R). In particular, T oriR (R/b, X) \u2208 \u03b4 for all 0 \u2264 i \u2264 t.\nProof. We just prove (i), the proof for (ii) is similar. First, we use induction on i to prove\nthat ExtiR (N, X) \u2208 \u03b4 whenever N \u2208 C f (R/a). Let i = 0 and N \u2208 C f (R/a). Considering\na suitable integer s and an exact sequence (R/a)s \u2192 N \u2192 0, we obtain the exact sequence\n0 \u2192 HomR (N, X) \u2192 HomR ((R/a)s , X) where HomR ((R/a)s , X) \u2208 \u03b4 by our assumption; so that\nHomR (N, X) \u2208 \u03b4 which completes the proof for the case where i = 0.\nSuppose that 1 \u2264 i \u2264 t and that our assertion holds for i \u2212 1. Let N \u2208 C f (R/a). By an exact\nsequence 0 \u2192 K \u2192 (R/a)s \u2192 N \u2192 0, where K \u2208 C f (R/a) and s is an integer, we obtain a long\nexact sequence\ni\ni\ns\n* * * \u2192 Exti\u22121\nR (K, X) \u2192 ExtR (N, X) \u2192 ExtR ((R/a) , X) \u2192 * * *\n\nwhere by the assumption in (i), ExtiR ((R/a)s , X) \u2208 \u03b4 and by induction hypothesis Exti\u22121\nR (K, X) \u2208 \u03b4\ntherefore ExtiR (N, X) \u2208 \u03b4. This terminates the induction argument. Now, an application of Lemma\n3.3 completes the proof.\n\n\u0003\n\nProposition 3.5. (compare [Mel; Corollary 3.14]) Suppose that X is an arbitrary R-module and\nthat cd(a, X) = 1. Then for all i \u2265 0, Exti (R/a, H 1 (X)) \u223c\n= Exti+1 (R/a, X/\u0393a(X)). In particular,\nR\n\na\n\nR\n\nif X is finite, then Hai (X) is a-cofinite for all i.\nProof. Since cd(a, X) = 1, Hai (Da(X)) = 0 for all i \u2265 0. Hence ExtiR (R/a, Da(X)) = 0 for all i \u2265 0\nby Theorem 2.2. Now, by the ideal transform sequence\n0 \u2192 X/\u0393a(X) \u2192 Da(X) \u2192 Ha1 (X) \u2192 0,\nwe get ExtiR (R/a, Ha1 (X)) \u223c\n= Exti+1\nR (R/a, X/\u0393a(X)) for all i \u2265 0.\n\n\u0003\n\nThe next proposition introduces some finite generalized local cohomology modules.\nProposition 3.6. Suppose that M, N are finite R-modules such that M = \u0393a(M ) and cd(a, N ) = 1.\nThen Hai (M, N ) is finite for all i \u2265 0.\nProof. Since cd(a, N ) = 1, Hai (Da(N )) = 0 for all i \u2265 0. Hence Hai (M, Da(N )) = 0 whenever i \u2265 0\nby Proposition 2.3. Then the ideal transform sequence\n0 \u2192 N/\u0393a(N ) \u2192 Da(N ) \u2192 Ha1 (N ) \u2192 0\n\n\f8\n\nS. H. HASSANZADEH AND A. VAHIDI\n\nin conjunction with [YKS; Lemma 1.1] yield the isomorphisms below:\nHai+1 (M, N/\u0393a(N )) \u223c\n= Hai (M, Ha1 (N )) \u223c\n= ExtiR (M, Ha1 (N )) and Hai (M, \u0393a(N )) \u223c\n= ExtiR (M, \u0393a(N ))\nfor all i \u2265 0. By Proposition 3.5 \u0393a(N ) and Ha1 (N ) are a-cofinite and, thus, by Proposition\n3.4 ExtiR (M, Ha1 (N )) and ExtiR (M, \u0393a(N )) are finite for all i \u2265 0. Thus Hai (M, N/\u0393a(N )) and\nHai (M, \u0393a(N )) are finite for all i \u2265 0 which in turn shows that Hai (M, N ) is finite for all i \u2265 0.\n\n\u0003\n\nK.-I. Yoshida [Yo] and, D. Delfino and T. Marley [DM] proved that in the case R is local and\ndimR/a = 1, Hai (M ) is a-cofinite for all i \u2265 0 and all finite R-modules M . K.-I. Kawasaki [K]\nproved the same property of local cohomology modules in the case where a is principle.\nAs a natural generalization to the above facts, S. Yassemi [Y2; Question 2.7] proposed a question whether the same results hold for generalized local cohomology modules. This question was\naffirmatively answered by K. Divaani-Aazar and R. Sazeedeh in [DS]. In the next theorem and its\ncorollaries, we recover the main theorems of [DS] in Corollary 3.9 and Corollary 3.10; furthermore\na wider class of ideals and R-modules are provided for which the corresponding generalized local\ncohomology modules are cofinite.\nTheorem 3.7. Suppose that M, N are finite R-modules with pd(M ) = t < \u221e and Hai (N ) is\na-cofinite for all i \u2265 0; suppose also that the category of a-cofinite R-modules is Abelian. Then\nHai (M, N ) is a-cofinite for all i \u2265 0.\nProof. We prove by using induction on t. In the case where t = 0, M is a projective R-module; so\n\u223c Rs . Hence by Lemma 2.5,\nthat there exist an R-module M \u2032 and an integer s such that M \u2295 M \u2032 =\nfor each i \u2265 0,\nHai (M, N ) \u2295 Hai (M \u2032 , N ) \u223c\n= HomR (M, Hai (N )) \u2295 HomR (M \u2032 , Hai (N ))\n\u223c\n= HomR (Rs , Hai (N )) \u223c\n= Hai (N )s .\nWhich implies the assertion in this case.\nSuppose that t > 0 and that the assertion holds for all finite R-modules with projective dimension\nless than t. Considering the exact sequence\n0 \u2192 K \u2192 Rn \u2192 M \u2192 0\nwhere K is an R-module and n is an integer, and we obtain the long exact sequence\n* * * \u2192 Hai\u22121 (Rn , N ) \u2192 Hai\u22121 (K, N ) \u2192 Hai (M, N ) \u2192 Hai (Rn , N ) \u2192 Hai (K, N ) \u2192 * * * .\nBy induction hypothesis Hai\u22121 (Rn , N ), Hai\u22121 (K, N ), Hai (Rn , N ) and Hai (K, N ) are a-cofinite while\nby our assumption, the category of a-cofinite R-modules is Abelian. Therefore Hai (M, N ) is acofinite as we desired.\n\n\u0003\n\nApplying [Mel; Theorems 7.4 and 7.10] and the above theorem it is straightforward to deduce\nthe following corollary.\n\n\fON VANISHING AND COFINITENESS OF GENERALIZED LOCAL COHOMOLOGY\n\n9\n\nCorollary 3.8. Suppose that dimR \u2264 2 and M, N are finite R-modules with pd(M ) < \u221e. Then\nHai (M, N ) is a-cofinite for all i \u2265 0.\nThe next two corollaries have already been proved in [DS; Theorems 2.8 and 2.9]. Here we\npresent new proofs based on Theorem 3.7.\nCorollary 3.9. Suppose that a is a principle ideal. Then for finite R-modules M, N with pd(M ) <\n\u221e, Hai (M, N ) is a-cofinite for all i \u2265 0.\nProof. According to Proposition 3.5 and Theorem 3.7 it is enough to prove that the category of\na-cofinite R-modules is Abelian.\nLet f : L \u2192 T be an R-homomorphism where L, T are two a-cofinite R-modules. To prove that\nthe category of a-cofinite R-modules is Abelian we need only to show that I = imf is an a-cofinite\nR-module.\nLet K = kerf and C = cokerf . Considering the exact sequences\n0 \u2192 I \u2192 T \u2192 C \u2192 0 and 0 \u2192 K \u2192 L \u2192 I \u2192 0,\none can obtain exact sequences\n0 \u2192 0 :I a \u2192 0 :T a \u2192 0 :C a and K/aK \u2192 L/aL \u2192 I/aI \u2192 0.\nThe latter exact sequences imply that 0 :I a and I/aI are finite. Therefore, by [Mel; Corollary 3.4],\nI is a-cofinite as we desired.\n\n\u0003\n\nCorollary 3.10. Suppose that p is a prime ideal of a complete local ring (R, m) with dimR/p = 1.\nThen for finite R-modules M, N with pd(M ) < \u221e, Hpi (M, N ) is p-cofinite for all i \u2265 0.\nProof. Our assumption on p in conjunction with [DM; Theorem 2] imply that the category of pcofinite R-modules is Abelian; so that this corollary is an consequence of Theorem 3.7 and the\nmentioned theorem of Yoshida and, Delfino and Marley.\n\n\u0003\n\nCorollary 3.11. Suppose that (R, m) is a local ring such that R/a is analytically irreducible (for\nexample regular) of dimension one. Then for finite R-modules M, N with pd(M ) < \u221e, Hai (M, N )\nis a-cofinite for all i \u2265 0.\nb a is a complete local domain, by Corollary 3.10 H i (M \u2297R R,\nb N \u2297R R)\nb and thus, by\nProof. As R/b\nb\na\nb is b\n[DST; Lemma 2.1 (ii)], H i (M, N ) \u2297R R\na-cofinite for all i \u2265 0. Now, [Mel2; Theorem 11.5(ii)]\na\n\nimplies that Hai (M, N ) is a-cofinite for all i \u2265 0.\n\n\u0003\n\nCorollary 3.12. Let (R, m) be a complete local ring and a be an ideal of R with dimR/a = 1.\nSuppose also that for each a-cofinite R-module L and each minimal member of V (a), say p, \u0393p(L)\nand Hp1 (L) are p-cofinite. Then Hai (M, N ) is a-cofinite for all i \u2265 0 whenever M, N are finite\nR-modules with pd(M ) < \u221e.\nProof. By [Mel; Proposition 7.12], our assumption on a implies that the category of a-cofinite Rmodules is Abelian. Now, the assertion follows from Theorem 3.7 and the mentioned theorem of\nYoshida and, Delfino and Marley.\n\n\u0003\n\n\f10\n\nS. H. HASSANZADEH AND A. VAHIDI\n\nAcknowledgments.
