In this setting, communicating with perfect\nfidelity requires a quantum code of bounded minimum distance,\nfor which the best known rates are given by the quantum\nGilbert-Varshamov (QGV) bound. Asking only for arbitrarily\nhigh fidelity and letting the sender and reciever use a secret\nkey of length logarithmic in the number of qubits sent, we find a\ndramatic improvement over the QGV rates. In fact, our protocols\nallow high fidelity transmission at noise levels for which perfect\nfidelity is impossible. To achieve such rates, we introduce fully\nquantum list codes, which may be of independent interest.\nIndex Terms- Quantum error correction, adversarial channels, approximate quantum codes, quantum list codes.\n\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nEffectively dealing with noise is a major challenge faced\nby all proposals for the coherent manipulation of quantum\ninformation. Besides communication, sending a quantum state\nover a noisy channel models noisy storage, and as such,\ncharacterizing communication rates for quantum channels is\na central question in the study of both quantum information\nand computation.\nVarious asymptotic capacities of quantum channels have been\nstudied [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11].\nHowever, this work has been almost exclusively concerned\nwith discrete memoryless channels (DMCs), wherein a sender\nand receiver use many independent and identical copies of a\nchannel. In this scenario, one studies the asymptotic communication rate possible using an operation of the form N \u2297n ,\nwhere N is the channel under consideration and the rate is\nR = k/n where k is the number of high fidelity logical qubits\nsent. Relatively little is known outside of the DMC scenario,\nwith notable exceptions found in [12], [13], [14], [15], [16].\nIn this paper, we study an adversarial quantum channel (AQC),\nwhich is perhaps as different from a DMC as one can imagine.\nWhen sending n qubits over an AQC, instead of errors on different qubits occuring independently, an adversary who knows\nwhat protocol is being used tries to foil the communication by\nmaliciously choosing a superposition of errors, subject only to\na restriction on the number of qubits each error affects. We\nadv\ncall this channel Np,n\n, where p is the fraction of qubits the\nadv\nadversary is allowed to corrupt. Np,n\nis the natural quantum\nDebbie Leung and Graeme Smith were both with the Institute for Quantum\nInformation, California Institute of Technology, MSC 107-81, Pasadena, CA\n91125, USA.

The quantum GilbertVarshamov bound guarantees the existence of such a code with\na rate of at least 1\u2212H(2p)\u22122p log 3 [20], where logarithms are\ntaken base 2 here and throughout. Communication beyond this\nrate is possible only if QECCs beating the Gilbert-Varshamov\nbound exist, which is a question that has been quite difficult\nto resolve. Furthermore, Rains has shown [21], [22]\n\u221a that\n\u0001 no\nquantum code can have distance greater than n 3 \u2212 3 /4 \u2248\n0.317n, so\u221athat it is impossible to send even a single qubit for\np \u2265 (3 \u2212 3)/8 \u2248 0.158.\nHowever, if we ask only for a high fidelity reconstruction,\nand allow the sender and receiver to share a secret key of\nsize O(log n) it is possible to communicate at rates much\nhigher than the Gilbert-Varshamov and Rains bounds suggest.\nBelow, we present a coding strategy for this scenario with a\nrate of 1\u2212H(p)\u2212p log 3, which is significantly larger than the\nGilbert-Varshamov rate for all values of p and remains nonzero\nup to p \u2248 0.189. Our rate equals the best communication rate\nvia the depolarizing channel (in the DMCs scenario) of error\nprobability p using only nondegenerate codes.\nThere are three ingredients in achieving such rates with\nnegligible length secret keys. The first is a predetermined\nquantum list code that is known to the adversary. This alone\nallows high-rate but low-fidelity transmission. To improve the\nfidelity, a random subcode is further chosen according to a\nsecret key unknown to the adversary. Finally, the subcode is\nderandomized using small-biased sets.\nBefore explaining the construction of our code, we first discuss\nsome intuition on why the code works and how resources are\nbeing reduced. Informally, a quantum list code is an error\ncorrecting code with the relaxed reconstruction requirement\nthat the decoded state be equal to the original state acted\non by a superposition of a small number of errors. We\ncall the number of errors the \"list length.\" This relaxation\nallows a considerable increase in rate over QECCs, and by\na random coding argument we show there are list codes with\nconstant-length lists and rates approaching 1\u2212H(p)\u2212p log 3\nthat tolerate pn errors. To distinguish between the errors in\nthe list and communicate with high fidelity, the sender and\nreceiver select a large subcode of the list code using a secret\nkey. In particular, this can be chosen pseudorandomly by using\nO(log n) bits of secret key.\n\n\fSUBMITTED TO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY\n\nWe can interpret our code as a set of (parity) check conditions\nthat yield syndrome information. Most of these conditions are\nused in list-decoding and can be known to the adversary,\nand the rest of the conditions are pseudorandom and with\nhigh probability are capable of completely distinguishing the\nerrors on the list. Note that there are simpler constructions\nusing randomness unknown to the adversary, and we now\nmake a comparison. The first construction is simply a random\n(nondegenerate) quantum error correcting code achieving the\nsame rate but requiring O(n2 ) bits of secret key 1 . Second,\none could use a secret permutation of the n qubits in the AQC\nturning the adversarial channel to something very similar to\nn depolarizing DMCs of error p in the DMCs setting [24],\n[15]. The best known rate is similar to ours (but slightly\nbetter for large p) but the cost will be O(n log n) bits of key,\nwhich, unfortunately, still gives a divergent key rate. Third,\nthe standard derandomizing technique of key recycling cannot\nbe used in a straightforward way in the current, adversarial,\ncontext. Thus, our hybrid construction involving a known listcode and a pseudorandom subcode demonstrates what type\nof randomness is unnecessary, and can be seen as a method\nto derandomize other key-inefficient protocols, achieving the\nsame task with a much shorter key.\nFor the rest of the paper, we summarize related works, review\nbackground material, present the details of our construction,\nafter which we discuss various applications and open problems.\nRelated work\nApproximate error correction was studied in [25] to reduce\nthe block length (and thus improving the rate) for a more\nspecific error model. Success criterion and algebraic sufficient\nconditions were given. Reference [26] provided an information theoretic approximate error correction criterion. The\napproximation in these works stems from a relaxed decoding\nprocedure. Much closer to our work is Ref. [27] (in the\ncontext of quantum secret sharing) that used a randomized\ncode to maximize the distance with high probability but the\nrate is low (of lesser concern in that context). Our construction\nwas inspired by that in [17] in the classical setting. Further\ncomparisons between our work and these earlier results and\ninsights obtained will be discussed in Section V.\nAfter the initial presentation of this result [28], we learned\nof two independent studies of list codes, both in settings quite\ndifferent from our own. Ref. [29] studied decoding of classical\nlist codes with quantum algorithms, and Ref. [30] studied list\ncodes for sending classical messages via iid quantum channels.\nII. BACKGROUND\n\nAND\n\nD EFINITIONS\n\nOur sender, receiver, and adversary will be named Alice, Bob,\nand Eve, respectively. The encoding of a k-qubit state |\u03c8i\ninto a QECC will be written as |\u03c8\u0304i. We call the Pauli group\nacting on n qubits Gn and write its elements in the form\nP = it X u Z v , where t \u2208 {0, 1, 2, 3}, u, v are binary vectors\n1 It is folklore, somewhat implicit in the hashing protocol of [23]. It is also\nimplied by our current construction.\n\n2\n\nof length n, X u \u0001(Z v ) denotes X u1 \u0001\u2297 * * * \u2297 X un (Z v1 \u2297 * * * \u2297\nZ vn ), X = 01 10 and Z = 10 \u221210 . The (anti)commutation\nrelation between P1 , P2 \u2208 Gn is determined by P1 P2 =\n(\u22121)\u03c9(P1 ,P2 ) P2 P1 with \u03c9(P1 , P2 ) = u1 * v2 + u2 * v1 , where\nthe dot products and sum are computed in arithmetic modulo\ntwo. We let hPl i denote the subgroup of Gn generated by a\nset of Pauli elements {Pl }.\n\nA state |\u03c8i is said to be stabilized by a Pauli matrix P when\nP |\u03c8i = |\u03c8i. An [n, k] stabilizer code is a 2k -dimensional\nspace of n-qubit states simultaneously stabilized by all elements of a size 2n\u2212k abelian subgroup of Gn . The abelian\nsubgroup is typically called S and is referred to as the code's\nn\u2212k\nstabilizer, and has n\u2212k generators denoted by {Si }i=1\n. For\nany E \u2208 Gn we refer to the (n\u2212k)-bit string \u03c9(E, Si ) as\nthe syndrome of E [20], [31]. The weight of a Pauli matrix\nP , which we denote by wt(P ), is the number of qubits on\nwhich P acts nontrivially, and we call a stabilizer code an\n[n, k, d] code if it can detect all errors outside of S of weight\nless than the distance d, which is equivalent to being able\nto correct all errors of weight less than \u230a(d\u22121)/2\u230b. For any\npositive real number r, let E r be the set of Pauli matrices of\nweight no more than \u230ar\u230b. Let N (S) be the set of all unitaries\nleaving S invariant under conjugation. (N (S) is the center\nand also the normalizer of S in Gn , thus the symbol N .)\nNote that two errors Ei and Ej have the same syndrome if\nand only if Ei\u2020 Ej \u2208 N (S). Thus S defines an [n, k, d] code\nexactly when every pair of errors Ei , Ej \u2208 E (d\u22121)/2 satisfies\nEi\u2020 Ej 6\u2208 N (S)\u2212S. Intuitively, it means that the syndrome can\nbe used to identify all errors of concern up to a multiplicative\nfactor that is in S and has no effect on the codespace.\n\nWe state a property of the Pauli group that will be useful later.\nFor any subgroup G of Gn , for any set S of i independent elements in G, and a specific (ordered) list of i (anti)commutation\nrelations with elements of S, exactly |G|/2\u2212i elements of G\nwill satisfy those relations.\nDefinition 1 The n-qubit adversarial quantum channel with\nadv\n, acts on a state of n qubits,\nerror rate p, which we call Np,n\n\u03c1, and is of the form\nX\nX\nadv\nAi \u03c1A\u2020i with Ai =\n\u03b1iE E\n(1)\nNp,n\n(\u03c1) =\ni\n\nE\u2208E pn\n\n\u2020\nsubject to the requirement that\ni Ai Ai = I and where\nnp\nE\n= {E \u2208 Gn | wt(E) \u2264 pn} is as defined before. The\nparticular choice of the {Ai }'s is made by Eve only after\nAlice and Bob have decided on a communication strategy.\n\nP\n\nadv\nNotice that to communicate effectively over Np,n\none must\nfind a strategy that works with high fidelity for all channels\ndescribed by Eq. (1). To do this, we will use quantum list\ncodes, which are defined below.\n\nDefinition 2 We say that an [n, k] stabilizer code, C, is an\n[n, k, t, L]-list code if there is a decoding operation, D, such\nthat for every Ei \u2208 E t and |\u03c8\u0304i \u2208 C, the decoded k-qubit state,\n\u2020\nalong\ns, is given\ni |\u03c8\u0304ih\u03c8\u0304|Ei ) =\nP by s\u2020D(E\nP\nP withs the syndrome\ns\u2020\ns\nsj Aj Aj = I, and each\ns\nj Aj |\u03c8ih\u03c8|Aj \u2297|sihs| where\n\n\fSUBMITTED TO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY\n\nAsj is a linear combination of the 2L elements of hPls iL\nl=1 ,\nwhere {Pls }L\nis\na\nlist\nof\nlogical\nerrors\non\nthe\ncodespace\nl=1\nand hPls iL\nl=1 is the group they generate.\nNote that in the above definition, the set {Pls }L\nl=1 generating\nthe error list depends on the syndrome s.\nIII. Q UANTUM L IST C ODES\nWe now show that, asymptotically, there exist [n, k, t, L]-list\ncodes with favorable parameters. We proceed by considering\nrandom stabilizer codes, arguing along the lines of [23], [20].\nIn particular, we will show that if we choose a random\nstabilizer code with rate as below, in the limit of large n the\nprobability of it failing to be L-list decodable is less than 1.\nTheorem 3 [n, \u230aRn\u230b, \u230apn\u230b, L]-list codes exist for sufficiently\nlarge n and for\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n(H(p) + p log 3) .\n(2)\nR<1\u2212 1+\nL\nE\nProof: Let NE = |E pn | and E pn = {Ei }N\ni=1 . Since two\n\u2020\nerrors Ei and Ej have the same syndrome iff Ei Ej \u2208 N (S),\na code will fail to be L-list decodable only if there are L + 1\nindependent errors E0 , * * * , EL outside of S having the same\nsyndrome. Mathematically, this means Ei\u2020 Ej \u2208 N (S) for 0 \u2264\ni, j \u2264 L (or equivalently, E0\u2020 Ej \u2208 N (S) for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 L). The\nproof consists of two steps: (1) bounding the probability (over\nthe code) for a fixed list of L independent Pauli matrices to be\nin N (S), and (2) taking the union bound over all such possible\nlists to show that list-decoding will fail with probability (over\nthe code) strictly less than 1. Thus, the desired list code must\nexist.\n\nStep (1) is essentially a counting argument. How many ways\ncan we choose n\u2212k stabilizer generators S1 , S2 , * * * Sn\u2212k ?\nHere we omit overall factors of \u00b11, i, but we count different\ngenerating sets (for the same code) and different orderings.2\nThere are two constraints for the generating set, commutivity and independence. S1 can be chosen from any of\nthe 22n \u22121 nontrivial Pauli matrices. Recall the property of\nGn stated in the previous section. S2 can be chosen from\nthe 22n\u22121 Pauli matrices commuting with S1 but must be\nchosen from outside of the multiplicative group generated by\nS1 , thus there are 22n\u22121 \u2212 2 choices. Similarly, each Si is\nchosen from the 22n\u2212(i\u22121) Pauli matrices commuting with\nS1 , * * * , Si\u22121 but not from the multiplicative group generated\nby them, so there are 22n\u2212(i\u22121)\n\u2212 2i\u22121 choices. Thus, there\n\u0001\nn\u2212k\u22121\n2n\u2212a\na\n2\n\u22122 distinct generating sets.\nare \u03a0a=0\n\nNow, for an arbitrary and fixed list E0 , * * * , EL of independent\nerrors, how many choices of stabilizer generators will give a\ncode with {E0\u2020 Ej } \u2208 N (S) \u2200j=1, * * * , L? This counting is\nsimilar to the above, but now S1 , S2 * * * Sn\u2212k are constrained\n2 Our analysis revolves around random stabilizer generators rather than\nrandom codes. As an aside, the resulting Q\ncode is also\nrandomly distributed.\n \u0301\nn\u2212k\u22121 ` n\u2212k\u2212b\nAlso, any stabilizer of size 2n\u2212k has\n2\n\u22121 different\nb=0\ngenerating sets, so we have also found the total number of stabilizers codes\nof this size.\n\n3\n\nto commute with {E0\u2020 Ej }, in addition to the two original\nconstraints. In other words, S1 can be chosen from the\n22n\u2212L \u2212 1 nontrivial Pauli operators commuting with the\nE0\u2020 Ej , and S2 has 22n\u2212L+1 \u22122\n\u0001 choices, and so on. Thus, there\n22n\u2212L\u2212a \u22122a sets of stabilizer generators that\nare \u03a0n\u2212k\u22121\na=0\ncommute with all of E0\u2020 Ej .\nPutting together with the two stabilizer counts, one unconstrained and the other with the same syndrome for\n{Ej }j=0,*** ,L , the latter has probability\n\u0001\n22n\u2212L\u2212a \u22122a\n\u03a0n\u2212k\u22121\na=0\n\u2264 2\u2212L(n\u2212k) .\n(3)\nn\u2212k\u22121\n2n\u2212a\na\n\u03a0a=0\n(2\n\u22122 )\nFor step (2), we apply the union bound for the choice\nof the L+1 Ej 's. The probability that a random\n[n, k]\n\u0001 \u2212L(n\u2212k)\nNE\n2\n,\ncode is not L-list decodable is less than L+1\nwhich is no more than NEL+1 2\u2212L(n\u2212k) . The latter is less\nthan 1 if k < n\u2212(1+ L1 ) log NE . But NE = |E pn | =\nP\u230anp\u230b r n\u0001\nr=0 3 r . For any \u03b4 > 0, \u2203n\u03b4 s.t. whenever n \u2265\nn\u03b4\u0002, log NE \u0001 \u2264 n(H(p)+p log 3+\u03b4/3)\nso choosing k =\n\u0003\nn 1\u2212 1+ L1 (H(p)+p log 3) \u22122\u03b4/3 finishes the proof.\nIV. C ODING S TRATEGY\nTheorem 3 tells us that for any R < 1\u2212H(p)\u2212p log 3, there\nexist [n, Rn, pn, L]-list codes for large enough n and L. For\nexample, we can choose the various parameters as \u03b4 = 1 \u2212\nH(p) \u2212 p log 3 \u2212 R, L \u2265 3\u03b4 (H(p)+ log 3), and n \u2265 n\u03b4 in\nThm. 3). Note that L does not grow with n.\nWe now fix such a list-code, C n,L . This always returns a\nsyndrome s, a corresponding list of errors Qsf \u2208 hPls i,\nP s\ns\u2020\n=:\nand a list-decoded state of the form\ni Bi |\u03c8ih\u03c8|Bi\ns\nN\n(|\u03c8ih\u03c8|),\nwhere\n|\u03c8i\nis\nthe\nsender's\nintended\nlogical\nstate,\nP s\u2020 s\ns\ns\ni Bi Bi = I, and each Bi is in the span of Qf . Note that\nlist-decoding removes all superposition between errors with\ndifferent syndromes. Also, no approximation has been made\nso far.\nNow we add a few more stabilizer generators to C n,L so that\nwith high probability (over the choice of the extra generators)\nthe receiver can decode |\u03c8i unambiguously. These generators\nare determined by a secret key shared by the sender and\nreceiver, making them unknown to the adversary.\nIt will follow from the proof of Thm. 4 below that adding\n(1/ log(4/3))(2L + log(1/\u01eb)) random generators to the code\nL\nC n,L would allow us to distinguish among the {Qsf }2j=1\npossible errors, with probability at least 1\u2212\u01eb. This would\nrequire 2n(2L+ log(1/\u01eb))/ log(4/3) bits of shared key.\nA much smaller key can be used if small-biased sets are\nused to choose these extra stabilizers pseudorandomly [32],\n[33]. A subset of {0, 1}m, denoted A, is said to be an \u03b7biased set of length m if for each e \u2208 {0, 1}m, roughly\nhalf of the elements of A have odd/even parity with e, or\nmathematically, |Pra\u2208A (e * a = 0) \u2212 Pra\u2208A (e * a = 1)| \u2264 \u03b7.\nThere are efficient constructions of \u03b7-biased sets of length m\n2\nwith only O( m\u03b7 ) elements [32], [33].\n\n\fSUBMITTED TO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY\n\n4\n\nLet G0 be the set of stabilizer generators of C n,L . We add\nK extra stabilizer generators T1 , * * * , TK . When j of these\nhave been added, denote the code by Cjn,L , with k\u2212j encoded\nn,L\nqubits and generator set Gj . (Each Cjn,L is a subcode of Cj\u22121\n.)\nThe next generator Tj+1 has to commute with all of Gj but\nnot be generated by it, thus, it is an encoded operation on\nthe code Cjn,L . Without loss of generality, it is an encoded\nPauli operation on the encoded k\u2212j qubits, and can be chosen\naccording to a random element of an \u03b7-biased set Aj+1 of\nlength 2(k\u2212j). The following theorem shows that using this\nprocedure to add K = O(L log 1/\u01eb) stabilizers allows the\nreceiver to reconstruct the encoded state with high probability.\nUsing the efficient constructions of \u03b7-biased sets of length\n2\nm \u2264 2n with only O( n\u03b7 ) elements, our construction requires\n\u0001\nO (2L + log(1/\u01eb)) log(n2 /\u03b7) bits of key.\nTheorem 4 Let C n,L be an [n, Rn, pn, L]-list code of rate R\nn,L\nand let CK\nbe the code obtained from C n,L by progressively\nadding K = (1/ log(4/3))(2L + log(1/\u01eb)) stabilizers determined by \u03b7-biased sets A1 , * * * , AK (of decreasing length)\nas described above. By using a secret key of fewer than\n2\nn,L\n, nR \u2212 K = n(R \u2212 o(n))\nO(K(log( n\u03b7 ))) bits to select CK\nadv\nqubits can be sent over Np,n\nwith fidelity at least 1 \u2212 \u01eb for\nall \u01eb < 1/2.\nProof: The [n, Rn, pn, L]-list code reduces the adversary's power to choosing some N s (with operation elements\nL\nin the span of {Qsf }2f =1 = hPls i) and a distribution of s.\nSo, if we prove that for each s, the probability (over the\nchoice of T1 , * * * , TK ) is less than \u01eb to fail to distinguish\nL\nbetween the {Qsf }2f =1 , the fidelity of the decoded state with\nthe original will be at least 1 \u2212 \u01eb. More specifically, fix an\narbitrary s.PIt is shown in [34] that N s has a \u03c7-representation\nN s (\u03c1) = f,f \u2032 \u03c7f,f \u2032 Qsf \u03c1(Qsf \u2032 )\u2020 and let\nFs = {k|\u2203f,f \u2032 \u03c9(Tlk , Qsf ) = \u03c9(Tlk , Qsf \u2032 )}\n\n(4)\n\nbe the set of key values for which the additional stabilizer\ngenerators fail to determine the list element. Then, letting\n|\u03c8k ih\u03c8k | be the encoded logical state and Dks be the decoding\noperation given list s and key k, our decoded state is\n\nTj is chosen using an \u03b7-biased string of encoded operations\nn,L\n,\nof the code Cj\u22121\n, we have Pr (Mj |Mj\u22121 . . . M1 ) \u2264 1+\u03b7\n\u0001 2\n\u0001\n1+\u03b7 K\nK\n. By\nwhich immediately implies that Pr \u2229j=1 Mj \u2264 2\na union bound over the choice of f, f \u2032 , the probability of any\npair having the same commutation relations for all j is less\n\u0001K\nthan 22L 1+\u03b7\n.\n2\n\nBy choosing \u03b7 \u2264 1/2, K = (1/ log(4/3))(2L + log(1/\u01eb)) we\nmake this failure probability less than \u01eb so that with probability\nat least 1\u2212\u01eb, Qsf can be unambiguously identified and the state\nreconstructed.\n\nNote that \u01eb can be made to vanish exponentially with n without\nincurring extra n-dependence on the key size.\nIn Theorem 4, the extra generators can distinguish the worst\ncase N s and no union bound over s is needed. Furthermore,\nthe additional stabilizers do not depend on s. It means that\nthe final construction is a single quantum error correcting\ncode depending only on a small key. It also means that it is\nnot necessary to first perform list-decoding before selecting\nthe extra stabilizers. The combined decoding operation is\nindependent of s but concludes the error based on the joint\ninputs of s and the extra syndrome bits (one possible way of\nwhich is to first output a list based on s).\n\nV. D ISCUSSION\nWe have introduced the adversarial quantum channel and\nshown that using a logarithmic length secret key one can communicate over this channel with a rate of 1\u2212H(p)\u2212p log 3.\nThis is far higher than would be naively expected from\nexisting QECCs, and quite close to the best known rates for\nindependent depolarizing channels of error probability p. Our\nconstruction involves quantum list codes, which we defined\nand showed to exist with favorable parameters. Classical list\ndecoding has recently played an important role in several\ncomplexity theoretic results (for a review, see [35]), and we\nexpect quantum list codes will be similarly useful in the\ncontext of quantum complexity theory.\n\nThe scenario considered in this paper and the spirit of our\nprotocols are closely related to those of [27]. Comparing their\nK\n1 X s s\nresult with ours points to interesting open questions. Reference\nDk (N (|\u03c8k ih\u03c8k |))\nK\n[27] constructed approximate quantum error correcting codes\nk=1\nX\nX\nof\nlength n capable of correcting up to (n \u2212 1)/2 errors with\n1\n1\nDks (N s (|\u03c8k ih\u03c8k |)) +\nDks (N s (|\u03c8k ih\u03c8k |)) high probability (compared to at most n/4 correctable errors\n=\nK\nK\nk6\u2208Fs\nk\u2208Fs\nfor an exact code). Thus, the fraction of errors that can be\n= (1 \u2212 Pr(Fs ))|\u03c8ih\u03c8| + Pr(Fs )\u03c6s ,\n(5) tolerated in [27] approaches 1/2 as n gets large, which is much\nP\nhigher than in our scheme. Furthermore, unlike our scheme,\n1\ns\ns\nwhere \u03c6s = K Pr(F\nk\u2208Fs Dk (N (|\u03c8k ih\u03c8k |)) is the state\ns)\nno secret key is required. Instead, randomizing parameters are\nconditional on the key failing to distinguish the list elements\nsent as part of the message via carefully constructed secret\nproperly. We will now show that Pr(Fs ) can be made less than\nsharing schemes. However, the alphabet size of the codes in\n\u01eb for all lists of length 2L by choosing K as in the theorem.\n[27] grows as a function of both the blocklength and the code's\nThis results in a decoding fidelity of at least 1 \u2212 \u01eb.\naccuracy which severely limits the transmission rate. Also,\nNow fix f, f \u2032 and define the events Mj as {\u03c9(Qsf , Tj ) = when their large dimensional channel is viewed as a block\n\u03c9(Qsf \u2032 , Tj )}. Then, the probability, over the choices of of qubit channels, the adversary considered in [27] is much\nT1,*** ,K , that they assign the same syndrome to Qsf and Qsf \u2032 more restricted than ours, being limited to the corruption of\n\u0001\nQK\nis Pr \u2229K\ncontiguous blocks of qubits.\nj=1 Mj =\nj=1 Pr (Mj |Mj\u22121 . . . M1 ). Since each\n\n\fSUBMITTED TO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY\n\nAltogether, there is a general open question on the tradeoff\nbetween distance, rate, and key required for a code. More\nspecifically, it is an interesting question whether there are\nqubit approximate QECCs which achieve the rates of our\ncodes without using a secret key, or, less ambitiously, one\nwith constant size. We have also left unanswered the capacity\nadv\nof Np,n\nassisted by a negligible length secret key. It seems\nplausible that the capacity is equal to that of the depolarizing\nchannel with error rate p, which would be in analogy with\nthe classical result of [17]. While the capacity of for the\ndepolarizing channel is an open question, one may find codes\nadv\nfor Np,n\nwith rates matching the best known for the depolarizing channel. It will also be interesting to consider other\nside resources such as a negligible amount of entanglement.\nFinally, unlike DMCs, it is unclear for adversarial channels\nwhether the capacity can be improved with a small number of\nuses of noiseless quantum channels.\nAs a side remark, our scheme uses the secret key as a\nrandomizing parameter that is inaccessible to the adversary.\nSince the adversary must corrupt the transmitted state before\nit is received by Bob, if Bob is allowed to send a \"receipt\"\nof the quantum states to Alice, she can simply disclose the\nrandom code afterwards and no key is required. In other words,\none bit of back communication along with logarithmic forward\nclassical communication (all authenticated) can replace the key\nrequirement.\nAs another side remark, as the channel can be used to create\nentanglement, the key used in the communication can be\nreplenished by sending a negligible number of EPR pairs\n(without affecting the communication rate). Thus the key\nrequirement is only catalytic.\nOur result also finds application to a related problem-\nentanglement distillation with bounded weight errors. In this\nproblem, a state is already distributed between Alice and Bob,\nso the adversary has already acted and randomizing parameters\ncan be sent in public without a receipt. In [36], it was shown\nthat n noisy EPR pairs with errors of weight up to pn could\nbe purified to n(1 \u2212 H(p) \u2212 p log 3) perfect EPR pairs by a\ntwo-way distillation procedure. Our construction lets us distill\nhigh fidelity EPR pairs at the same rate with only forward\nclassical communication. In fact, it was suggested in [36] that\nquantum list codes could be used to reduce the computational\ncomplexity of their protocols-almost exactly the approach\ntaken here, though in our case with an eye towards reducing\nthe communication required. The question of efficent encoding\nand decoding via list codes has not yet been resolved.\nIt may also be interesting to consider how restricting the\ncomputational power of our adversary affects the channel's\ncapacity, which is another topic we leave to future work. The\ninvestigation of other restrictions (such as causality of the\nadversarial channel) is also natural in certain situations and\nmay lead to additional insights.\n\n5\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe are grateful to Roberto Oliveira, John Smolin, Daniel\nGottesman, and especially Aram Harrow for helpful discussions, as well as to the IBM T.J.
