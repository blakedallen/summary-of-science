Introduction\nStudying the molecular cloud properties in starburst, active and\ninteracting galaxies is important in order to understand the feedback mechanisms between star formation, dynamics and the interstellar medium. Important probes of cloud properties include\nmolecules such as HCN, HCO+ and HNC (e.g. Krips et al. 2008;\nGraci\u00e1-Carpio et al. 2008; Imanishi et al. 2004; Gao & Solomon\n2004; Aalto et al. 2002) that trace the dense (n \u223c> 104 cm\u22123 ) star\nforming phase of the molecular gas.\nAlternatively, to study the bulk properties of the molecular\ngas one can use the ratio between 12 CO and its isotopomer 13 CO.\nGlobally, there is a correlation between the 12 CO/13 CO 1\u20130 ratio\n(R) and the FIR f (60\u03bcm)/ f (100\u03bcm) flux ratio (e.g. Young &\nSanders 1986; Aalto et al. 1995). The extreme values of R (i.e.\nR>20) generally occur in luminous merging galaxies with large\ndust temperatures (e.g. Aalto et al. 1995; Glenn & Hunter 2001).\nWithin galaxies there is a general trend of increasing R towards\nthe central region where the gas is warmer and denser (e.g. Wall\net al. 1993; Aalto et al. 1995; Paglione et al. 2001).\nSend offprint requests to: S. Aalto\n\nBoth high kinetic temperatures and large turbulent line\nwidths will decrease the optical depth (\u03c4), of the 12 CO and 13 CO\n1\u20130 lines and thus elevate the line ratio R. Therefore, information on the spatial variation of R can be used to identify regions\nof extreme or unusual physical conditions in the molecular gas and global values can help classify galaxies. Aalto et al. (1995)\nsuggested some general diagnostics of the cloud conditions and\nenvironment based on global values of R:\n\u2013 Small ratios, R \u2248 6 are an indication of a normal Galactic\ndisc population of clouds dominated by cool, self-gravitating\nGiant Molecular Clouds (GMCs).\n\u2013 Intermediate ratios 10 \u223c< R <\u223c 15 are associated with the inner\nregions of normal starburst galaxies where the gas is warmer\nand denser than in the disc.\n\u2013 The extreme values R > 20 seem to originate in warm, turbulent, high pressure gas in the centres of luminous mergers\nwith highly compact molecular distributions and gas surface\ndensities in excess of 104 M\u2299 pc\u22122 -two orders of magnitude\nhigher than in typical Milky Way GMCs. Large surface densities require high pressures in hydrostatic equilibrium and\nlow density (n < 103 cm\u22123 ) - 12 CO emitting - gas must be\nsupported by large turbulent line widths (P \u221d n(\u03b4V)2). Thus,\n\n\f2\n\nS.

Tosaki et al. (2002) find this in\nthe spiral arms of M 51 and Meier & Turner (2004) in the centre\nof the spiral galaxy NGC 6946. H\u00fcttemeister et al. (2000) find\nlarge values of R in the large scale bar of NGC 7479 as a result of the dynamical impact of a density wave on gas properties.\n\n800\n\n2\n\n0\n\nThe nearby merger NGC 4194 - the Medusa merger - belongs to a class of lower luminosity (LFIR = 8.5 \u00d7 1010 L\u2299 at\nD=39 Mpc) E+S mergers (Aalto & H\u00fcttemeister 2000; Manthey\net al. 2008), an order of magnitude fainter than well known Ultra\nLuminous Galaxies (ULIRGs (LFIR >\u223c 1012 L\u2299 )) such as Arp 220.\nThe Medusa has an elevated value of R (\u224820) (e.g. Aalto et al.\n1991; Casoli et al. 1992; Glenn & Hunter 2001), but in contrast to the more luminous high-R mergers, NGC 4194 has a\nrelatively extended (2 kpc) starburst region (e.g. Armus et al.\n1990; Prestwich et al. 1994) and Aalto & H\u00fcttemeister (2000)\nfound that the molecular gas was also distributed on the comparatively large scale of 25\u2032\u2032 (4.7 kpc), despite its advanced stage\nof merger. Due to the linear extent of the molecular gas and relative proximity of the Medusa merger, it is possible to spatially\nresolve the relative distributions of 12 CO and 13 CO and hence\nallow the investigation of the underlying causes of the elevated\nR values observed in this galaxy. The Medusa starburst is particularly interesting to study since its LLFIR\nratio of 163 rivals that\nCO\nof ULIRGs (for example Arp 220 with a LLFIR\nof 210), despite\nCO\nthe comparatively modest luminosity, indicating an exceptionally high star formation efficiency (SFE) in the Medusa merger.\nGao & Solomon (2004) find that for galaxies with LFIR <\u223c 1011 L\u2299\nratio is typically 33. At higher luminosity they find that\nthe LLFIR\nCO\nLFIR\nLCO instead increases to 100\u2013300. Gao & Solomon (2004) sugFIR\ngest that, in contrast to CO, the LLHCN\nratio is independent of luLFIR\nminosity with LHCN =900. Interestingly the Medusa deviates sigFIR >\nnificantly from this HCN correlation with a LLHCN\n\u223c 4075 based on\nupper limits from Aalto & H\u00fcttemeister (2000)). Further discussion of the underlying causes of this discrepancy are presented\nin Aalto & H\u00fcttemeister (2000).\nWe have imaged NGC 4194 in the 13 CO 1\u20130 line with the\nOwens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO) millimetre array. Our\naim was to compare the distribution of the 12 CO and 13 CO emission within the galaxy and to see how it relates to star formation,\ngas surface density and dynamics. In sections 2 and 3 we discuss\nthe observations and results. In section 4 we discuss the R line\nratio variations within the Medusa merger in terms of warm gas\nin the starburst region and possible diffuse gas in the central dust\nlane. Future observational tests for these proposed scenarios are\nsuggested.\n\n-2\n\n-4\n\n-6\n6\n4\n2\n0\n-2\nARC SEC\nCenter at RA 12 11 41.22000 DEC 54 48 16.4000\nGrey scale flux range= 1.0 1000.0\nCont peak flux = 4.7088E-03 JY/BEAM\nLevs = 9.000E-04 * (-3, 3, 4, 5, 6)\n\n-4\n\n-6\n\n-8\n\nFig. 1.

Continuum subtraction\n\nUsing the aips task imlin we fitted continuum to the line-free\nchannels and subtracted from the cleaned map. The resulting\ncontinuum map is presented in Fig. 1 and the flux density and\nposition in Tab. 1. The 1.4 GHz continuum position of Condon\net al. (1990) agree within 0.\u2032\u2032 4 with the 110 GHz position which\nis within the positional errors of the 13 CO map. The 1.4 GHz radio continuum emission is dominated by synchrotron emission\nresulting primarily from star-formation, along with a small contribution from the compact core (Beswick et al. 2005; Condon\net al. 1990). The 110 GHz the emission (see Fig. 1) is coincident\nwith the area of highest dust obscuration observed in the optical.\nThis emission is tracing the thermal emission from dust in this\nregion illuminated by ongoing star-formation. This is consistent\nwith the alignment in the 110 and 1.4 GHz continuum positions\nobserved.\n\n2. Observations\n\n2.2. Alignment of the data\n\nWe have obtained maps of 13 CO 1\u20130 using the Caltech sixelement OVRO millimeter array. Two tracks were taken in\nthe low resolution configuration in April 2000. The naturally\nweighted synthesised beam size is 4 \u2032\u2032. 56 \u00d7 3 \u2032\u2032. 98 (472 \u00d7 378 pc\nfor D=39 Mpc) and the beam position angle (BPA) is \u201340\u25e6 .\nSystem temperatures were 500\u2013600 K. The quasar\n1150+497 was used for phase calibration and Neptune and\nUranus for absolute flux calibration. The digital correlator, centred at VLSR = 2560 km s\u22121 , provided a total velocity coverage of\n\nBoth the 12 CO and 13 CO observations were made using the same\ninstrument and employing identical gain and passband calibrators, thus minimising potential misalignments due to instrumental effects. Furthermore, the 110 GHz continuum extracted from\nthe 13 CO data set is positionally coincident with the 1.4 GHz\ncontinuum (see Sect. 2.1) suggesting that there are no systematic errors in the positions of the 13 CO data set. We also note that\nthe shift between 12 CO and 13 CO is partially caused by missing\n13\nCO emission in some velocity channels (see Sect. 3.3).\n\n\fS.

Note that for 12 CO a big fraction of the detected, extended flux is not\nshown due to the cut-off. The comparative channels maps show the position of the peak emission for 12 CO and 13 CO. The velocity in panel\n18=2714 km s\u22121 , panel 14 is 2538 km s\u22121 , and panel 10=2362 km s\u22121 . Increment between panels is 44 km s\u22121 . Crosses indicate the 1.4 GHz radio\ncontinuum position. The beam is marked in the upper right corner of the first panel for the 12 CO and 13 CO channel maps. Greyscale for the 12 CO\nmap ranges from 50 to 400 mJy beam\u22121 and for 12 CO from 7.5 to 26 mJy beam\u22121 . For the 13 CO map the first contour corresponds to 2.5\u03c3.\n\npart of the main optical body (see Fig. 2 (left panel)). The extended 12 CO flux density traces the two prominent dust lanes:\none of which crosses the central region at right angles to the optical major axis, and the second which curves to the north-east\nand joins the base of the northern molecular tidal tail. The total\nmolecular mass in the system is estimated to be at most 2 \u00d7 109\nM\u2299 , depending on which 12 CO - H2 conversion factor is applicable.\n\n3.2. Integrated 13 CO 1\u20130 intensity\n\nThe naturally weighted, 4.\u2032\u2032 5 resolution, 13 CO emission is distributed on a scale of 8\u2032\u2032 (1.8 kpc) in an oval structure centred\non the optically bright centre of the galaxy. There is also an offcentre 13 CO concentration 10\u2032\u2032 north of the centre. In Fig 2 (right\npanel) we show the integrated 13 CO map overlaid on a 12 CO map\nsmoothed to the 13 CO resolution. Integrated- and peak flux densities are listed in Tab. 1.\nThe 13 CO emission in the inner 8\u2032\u2032 is shifted towards the\nnorth-west as compared to the 12 CO distribution. The shift is\n2.\u2032\u2032 3 (430 pc). Also the northern 13 CO emission peak is shifted\noff the corresponding 12 CO peak to the south-west by 2.\u2032\u2032 5. In\nFig. 3 (centre panel) the 13 CO 1\u20130 map is overlaid on an HST\nWFPC2 image. This shows that the 13 CO emission is not tracing\nthe central dust lane (which the 12 CO does (left panel in Fig. 3))\nbut instead is shifted towards the north-west part of the starburst\nand towards the western dust features. The moment maps were\nproduced through smoothing in velocity and space (3 channels,\n3 pixels boxcar smoothing) and then applying a 2\u03c3 flux cut-off\n(allowing both positive and negative flux levels).\n\n3.3. The channel map\n\nIn Fig. 4 the channel maps of 12 CO and 13 CO 1\u20130 are presented, smoothed to a resolution of 5\u2032\u2032 . Compared to 12 CO,\n13\nCO-emission is \"missing\" primarily in three velocity bins in\nthe centre: 2495, 2538 and 2620 km s\u22121 . In the first case we find\n13\nCO emission 10\u2032\u2032 north of the centre - despite 12 CO in the same\nbin having a peak in the centre. In the second case 13 CO emission is found only west of the centre while 12 CO is distributed\neast and west of the radio peak. In the 2620 bin there is a bright\n12\nCO peak in the centre which is missing in 13 CO. In general, the\nchannel maps show that there is no 13 CO emission east, northeast of the radio continuum peak apart from a small region of\nemission 10\u2032\u2032 north of the central region.\n3.4. Line ratios\n\nWe find that R is 7 \u2013 10 in the region 10\u2032\u2032 north of the centre while in the centre it is significantly greater: ranging from 16 in\nthe western region of the centre to >45 (3\u03c3) in the eastern part\nof the centre where the central dust lane is making a 90 degree\nturn. Over a distance of 5\u2032\u2032 (945 pc) the line ratio, R, changes\nby more than a factor of 3. A map of the varying R line ratios is\ndisplayed in Fig 3 (right panel).\n\n4. Discussion\nThe line ratio change in the Medusa occurs on scales of 0.5 to 1\nkpc where the ratio goes from extreme ratios >40 to more normal starburst ratios of 16. This observed gradient in R is likely to\nbe caused either by the presence of diffuse, unbound molecular\ngas or a temperature gradient in the ISM. In the following sec-\n\n\fS. Aalto et al.: Molecular clouds in NGC 4194\n\n5\n\ntion we discuss each of these scenarios and compare these with\nobservations in other galaxies.\n\ngesting that the similar shift in the Medusa is caused by the funnelling and compression of gas towards the starburst region.\n\n4.1. Diffuse gas in the central dust lane?\n\n4.2. Temperature gradient in the gas?\n\nOptical images of the Medusa merger are dominated by the\nstrong absorption from several dust lanes - the most prominent\none crossing the central starburst region. We suggest that the intense starburst activity is being fed by gas funnelled along the\ndust lane - supported by the bright 12 CO emission associated\nwith the dust lane(s), and the distribution and dynamics seen in\nthe Hi absorption at high resolution (Beswick et al. 2005). The\ncentral dust lane is in front of the main burst region in the east\nand then appears to curve into the burst region itself at the centre. A possible scenario is then that the molecular gas is diffuse\n(non self-gravitating) in the dust lane region - creating the general east-west gradient in the line ratio R.\nInterestingly, a comparison of the Medusa 13 CO image and\nthe H\u03b1 images of Hattori et al. (2004) show that the position\nof the H\u03b1 equivalent width (EW) peak coincides with the regions of lower values of R. The large EW is consistent with the\nregion being an extra-nuclear star forming region. It coincides\nwith the western radio continuum arm and the Giant Molecular\nAssociation (GMA) feature c in the high-resolution 12 CO map\n(see Aalto & H\u00fcttemeister (2000)). Thus, it seems that the 13 CO\nemission correlates spatially with more quiescent, spiral-arm\nlike star formation, shifted from the dust lane and the central\nstarburst. Note that if the 12 CO 1\u20130 is mainly tracing diffuse gas\nthe 13 CO 1\u20130 emission is showing the real mass distribution of\nthe molecular gas. Fig. 10 of Aalto & H\u00fcttemeister (2000) shows\nthat the correlation between 1.4 GHz radio continuum and the\ncentral dust lane is poor - this could be a further indication of\nboth a lack of ongoing star formation in the dust lane as well as\nthe molecular gas potentially being diffuse in the dust lane (see\nfor instance the discussion of 12 CO and radio continuum in the\nspiral arm of M 83 by Rand et al. (1999)).\n\nIn this scenario, the elevated value of R in the eastern part of the\ncentral region is caused not by diffuse molecular gas but by the\ngas there being warmer and denser than in the north-west. For\na temperature gradient to result in elevated values of R it is required that the average gas densities exceed 3 \u00d7 103 cm\u22123 (since\nthe 1\u20130 transition of 12 CO and 13 CO must be thermalised). A\nchange of R from 16 to >40 can be caused by a temperature increase from 40 to 150 K in the gas (for a constant column- and\ngas density per cloud). If both the temperature and gas density\nis increasing towards the east then a smaller change in temperature could explain the change in R. If it is filled with warm and\ndense gas, the dust lane would be more likely to harbour intense\nstar formation than the rest of the central region. However, as we\nmentioned above, the dust lane shows no sign of elevated star\nformation rates, although it is potentially hidden behind large\nmasses of dust. High resolution imaging of higher J-transition\n(e.g. 2\u20131) emission from 13 CO and 12 CO will allow these diffuse\ngas and temperature effects to be distinguished. If the faint 13 CO\n1\u20130 emission in the eastern central part is caused by diffuse gas\nthe 13 CO 2\u20131 emission should be even fainter there while the\nopposite is true if it is caused by a high gas temperature. This\nis because the 2\u20131 level would be more populated than the 1\u20130\nfor 13 CO if the gas is warm - while the opposite is true if the gas\nis diffuse. One example where faint 13 CO 1\u20130 is accompanied\nby bright 13 CO 2\u20131 is the merger Arp 299 where it was suggested that the elevated value of R is due to temperature effects\n(Aalto et al. 1999). Other studies of multi-transition 13 CO can\nbe found in Aalto et al. (e.g. 1995); Glenn & Hunter (e.g. 2001);\nIsrael (e.g. 2009). Additionally, high density tracer species such\nas HCN or HCO+ will reveal where gas of densities n > 104\ncm\u22123 is located in relation to the starburst and dust lane. If the\ndust lane is filled with diffuse gas very little dense gas will be\nfound there. A high resolution dust SED will reveal where hot\nand cold dust is in relation to the dust lane and central- and offnuclear star formation.\nAn abundance gradient: If the physical conditions in the gas are\nkept constant, an elevated R may be caused by a change in the\n12 13\nC/ C abundance ratio. This possibility has been discussed by\nCasoli et al. (e.g. 1992) as an effect of low metallicity gas being\ntransported from the outskirts of the merger to its centre. The\nstarburst would then contribute to enriching the gas in 13 C. In\nthis scenario the gas in the dust lane has then not yet been enriched by the starburst and there is therefore an east-west and\nnorth-south age-gradient. However, abundances in NGC 4194\nare found to be close to solar, and no significant metallicity gradient can be found from a study of the properties of the star forming regions (Hancock et al. 2006).\n\n4.1.1. Spatial shifts in R in other galaxies\n\nEven if the central region of the Medusa is more chaotic than\nthat of a density wave spiral galaxy, and the extinction structure suggests a three-dimensional central region, it is tempting\nto compare the shift in 12 CO and 13 CO to that found in other\ngalaxies. Tosaki et al. (2002) found a spatial shift between 12 CO\nand 13 CO 1\u20130 emission on similar spatial scales in the southern\nspiral arm of M 51. The shift seems to separate diffuse (unbound)\nlower density gas (as traced by 12 CO) from self-gravitating gas\nemitting the bulk of the 13 CO line emission. Tosaki et al. (2002)\nsuggested that there is a 107 yr time delay between the accumulation of gas by the M 51 spiral density wave and the formation\nof self-gravitating clouds, resulting in the 13 CO emission being\nfound downstream in the spiral arm where it is also spatially\ncorrelated with H\u03b1 emission. Meier & Turner (2004) find for\nNGC 6946 that the value of R reaches high values of 40 away\nfrom the central starburst which they attribute to diffuse, lowdensity molecular gas in and behind the molecular arms.\nWithin the barred galaxy NGC 7479 spatial shifts between\n13\nCO and 12 CO have also been found (H\u00fcttemeister et al. 2000).\nThese shifts have been attributed to density-wave or bar-like dynamical effects. The similarity of these spatial shifts with those\nfound in the Medusa may suggest similar dynamical effects may\nbe important. In particular, the transition region between diffuse\ninter arm gas and self-gravitating gas in the arms of M 51 sug-\n\n4.3. The large scale gradient in R\n\nIn the Medusa, the lowest ratios of 7 \u2013 10 are found in the taillike region north of the centre. It is not unusual to find that R is\ndecreasing away from the central region. This has been seen towards many starburst galaxies including NGC 3256, NGC 1808\nand large spiral galaxies such as M 51. The gas 10\u2032\u2032 north of the\ncentre may therefore consist of rather ordinary cool Galactictype GMCs. This is interesting since the gas there does not appear to be in a normal disc distribution, but rather in a shell or\n\n\f6\n\nS. Aalto et al.: Molecular clouds in NGC 4194\n\na tidal tail. There is no apparent star formation going on in this\nregion and the line widths are narrow. If the gas in the central\nregion is accumulating from the outer regions of the Medusa via\nthe central dust lane, then our results suggest that the molecular cloud properties are normal in the outskirts, before becoming\ndiffuse due to the funnelling of gas towards the centre and then\naccumulates as self-gravitating, star-forming clouds in the centre\nof the Medusa.\n4.4. The nature of the Medusa starburst\n4.4.1. Comparing with local minor mergers\n\nOne of the few E+S minor mergers to have its molecular medium\nstudied is the Medusa \"look-alike\" NGC 4441. Based on single\ndish observations of 12 CO and 13 CO 2\u20131 and 1\u20130 J\u00fctte et al.\n(2010) suggest that the molecular gas is in an unbound, diffuse state. Interestingly NGC 4441 appears to be an evolved version of the Medusa with similar morphology and luminosity and\nhigh resolution 12 CO1\u20130 observations of NGC 4441 show that\nit traces a centrally crossing dust lane. The star formation rate\nof NGC 4441 is much lower than that of the Medusa - likely\ndue to the diffuse state of its molecular medium. In this paper\nwe suggest that a fraction of the Medusa molecular ISM may be\nthe diffuse - it is possible that the entire molecular gas content\nof NGC 4441 is in this state. This raises interesting questions on\nthe nature of the Medusa starburst and what it will evolve into.\nPerhaps it will be left with a remnant, feeble dust lane, a small\nreservoir of diffuse gas and only low level star formation, like\nNGC 4441.\n4.4.2. Is the star formation out of equilibrium?\n\nDespite being a minor merger of comparatively moderate luminosity, the Medusa has an LFIR /LCO ratio (163) similar to those\nof typical ULIRGs such as Arp 220 (210) - suggesting that its\nSFE rivals that of the compact ULIRGs. However, the fraction\nof dense (n > 104 cm\u22123 ) gas is significantly lower in the Medusa\ndespite its similar SFE to ULIRGs (Aalto & H\u00fcttemeister 2000).\nAalto & H\u00fcttemeister (2000) estimate the gas consumption time\nfor the Medusa starburst to 40 Myrs and, if a significant fraction of the molecular medium is diffuse, this time could be even\nshorter.\nThe picture becomes even more interesting when one considers that most of the ongoing star formation in the Medusa\nseems not to be traced by FIR or radio emission. The H\u03b1 SFR\nis found to be \u224846 M\u2299 yr\u22121 (Hancock et al. 2006), while the\nFIR estimated SFR is 6\u20137 M\u2299 yr\u22121 (Aalto & H\u00fcttemeister 2000).\n(Note, that the SFR estimated from H\u03b1 would suggest an even\nmore extreme SFE than the already high SFE derived from the\nFIR emission.) It is possible that variations in the initial mass\nfunction (IMF) can account for some of these differences (e.g.\nWilkins et al. 2008), although the issue is far from resolved.\nSuch an anomaly in the form of a flatter upper IMF could lead\nto enhanced H\u03b1 emission. The molecular morphology is also\nquite different from that of 1.4 GHz radio continuum - which is\nalso quite different from that found from other luminous galaxies where the two distributions are usually found to coincide.\nThe optical star formation is concentrated in knots that could be\nprecursors to globular clusters. These knots have no clear spatial\nrelation to either the molecular gas distribution or the continuum.\nThis indicates a local deviation from the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation (KS) in the Medusa that warrants further study. We suggest\n\nthat the starburst of the Medusa is in an extreme transient phase\nof very high efficiency.\n4.4.3. Comparing the Medusa to high-redshifts extreme\nstarbursts\n\nThe Medusa merger has a number of features in common with\nsome extreme starbursts at high-z (despite its significantly lower\nluminosity). The starburst regions in high-z systems often seem\nextended (> 3 kpc), gas consumption times are similarly short\nand there is a combination of ordered rotation and merger-driven\nrandom motions and inflows. More importantly, Bothwell et al.\n(2010) find for three z=3 ULIRGs a significant size difference\nbetween the CO distribution and star formation tracers. They\nfind that this size difference results in the SFEs within systems\nto vary by up to a factor of five. As a consequence to their results they conclude that SMGs lie significantly above the KS\nrelation, indicating that stars may be formed more efficiently in\nthese extreme systems than in other high-z starburst galaxies.\nThe Medusa merger is (by far) less luminous than the high-z\nsystems studied by Bothwell et al. (2010) but a careful study of\nthe extreme starburst of the Medusa merger may lead to insights\nthat can be applied to more distant galaxies.\n\n5. Conclusions\nWe have obtained a high resolution map of the Medusa merger,\nNGC 4194, in the 13 CO 1\u20130 line with the OVRO array. The main\nconclusions we draw from this map are:\n1. The 13 CO 1\u20130 emission is mainly distributed in the northwestern part of the inner 8\u2032\u2032 region. There is also an offcentre 13 CO peak in the tail-like distribution to the north,\nwhere the CO/13 CO line ratios are similar to those of galactic type GMCs\n2. The 12 CO/13 CO 1\u20130 line ratio, R, varies on a scale of 950 pc\nfrom 16 (typical values for starburst galaxies) in the northwest to >40 in the eastern part of the central region.\n3. We suggest that this shift between 12 CO and 13 CO emission\nis caused by the presence of diffuse gas in a prominent dust\nlane crossing the eastern part of the centre. A strong density\nwave-like phenomenon may cause shocks (hence the dust\nlane) and the 13 CO is tracing more self-gravitating gas in\nthe post-shock region in the starburst. In this scenario, the\nactual molecular mass distribution is better traced by the\n13\nCO 1\u20130 emission than the 12 CO. Alternatively, the line ratio shift is caused by temperature and density gradients in\nthe gas. These two scenarios can be tested through imaging\nof 13 CO 2\u20131 and high density tracer molecules such as HCN\nand HCO+ .\n4. The extreme star formation efficiency and the lack of correlation between various star formation tracers suggest that\nthe inner region of the Medusa merger is in a highly transient phase. We predict that it will evolve into a quiescent\nobject similar to NGC 4441, but that in its current evolutionary stage it may have some features in common with high\nredshift starburst galaxies.\nAcknowledgements.
