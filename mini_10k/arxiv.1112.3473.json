Introduction\nNowadays there is a growing interest in using quantum entanglement measures for study of\nquantum correlations in topologically ordered systems [1]. The analysis of these systems is a\nhighly non-trivial task due to the absence of the order parameter. Particular examples are\nthe integer and fractional quantum Hall liquids which cannot be understood in terms of the\ntraditional description of phases based on symmetry breaking and local order parameters. The\nmain stream of such an analysis is focused on many-particle one-dimensional systems (cf [2]).\nRecently, topological phases were studied in finite systems such as two-dimensional electrons at\nvery high magnetic field (Laughlin states) [3] and weakly interacting two-dimensional rotating\nBose-Einstein condensate [4]. There are attempts to find a relation between topological orders\nof different topological phases and quantum phase transitions, driven by quantum fluctuations\nat zero temperature in many-body systems (see a textbook [5]).\nIt is believed that various quantum phases could exist in quantum dots (QDs) at different\nstrengths of the applied perpendicular magnetic field [6]. At small magnetic field strengths one\nobserves the orbital momentum and spin oscillations of the ground state of a QD by increasing\nthe field strength. At certain field range the oscillations disappear and electrons form a fully\npolarized state called the maximum density droplet. It is expected that a further increase of\nthe magnetic field should lead to the formation of the Wigner molecule, a finite-size analogue of\nthe Wigner crystallization of the homogeneous electron gas. A natural question arises: if QDs\ncan be considered as a finite-size analogy of conventional condensed matter systems what are\nsignatures of quantum phase transitions in QDs ?\n\n\fTo shed light on this question we will employ the entanglement and compare its evolution with\nthe evolution of quantum spectra of QDs as a function of the magnetic field. Evidently, finite\nsystems can only show precursors of the QPT behaviour. However, they are also important for\nthe development of the concept. Two-electron QDs being realictic tractable nontrivial systems\nare, in particular, attractive because their eigenstates can be obtained very accurately, or in\nsome cases, exactly (cf [7, 8]). Moreover, it was found that at certain values of the magnetic\nfield quantum spectra of two-electron QDs become degenerate due to onset of the spherical\nsymmetry [9, 10]. The goal objective of the present paper is to demonstrate that a quantum\nentanglement can be used to indicate this transition in a three-dimensional (3D) quantum dot\nunder a magnetic field.\n2. Basics\nOur analysis is carried out by means of the numerical diagonalization of the Hamiltonian\nH=\n\n2 \u0014\nX\n1 \u0010\n\nj=1\n\n2m\u2217\n\nk\ne \u00112\n+ Hspin .\npj \u2212 Aj + U (rj ) +\nc\n|r1 \u2212 r2 |\n\u0015\n\n(1)\n\nHere k = e2 /4\u03c0\u03b50 \u03b5r and Hspin = g \u2217 \u03bcB (s1 + s2 ) * B describes the Zeeman term, where \u03bcB =\neh\u0304/2me c is the Bohr magneton. As an example, we will use the effective mass m\u2217 = 0.067me ,\nthe relative dielectric constant \u03b5r = 12 and the effective Land\u00e9 factor g\u2217 = \u22120.44 (bulk\nGaAs values). For the perpendicular magnetic field we choose the vector potential with gauge\nA = 21 B\u00d7 r = 21 B(\u2212y, x, 0). The confining potential is approximated by a 3D axially-symmetric\nharmonic oscillator U (r) = m\u2217 [\u03c902 (x2 + y 2 ) + \u03c9z2 z 2 ]/2, where h\u0304\u03c9z and h\u0304\u03c90 are the energy scales\nof confinement in the z-direction and in the xy-plane, respectively.\nBy introducing the center of mass (CM) and relative coordinates: R = 21 (r1 + r2 ) and\nr12 = r1 \u2212 r2 , \u2013 the Hamiltonian (1), in agreement with the Kohn theorem [11], separates\ninto the CM and relative-motion terms H = HCM + Hrel (see details in [8]). The CM term is\ndescribed by the oscillator Hamiltonian with the mass M = 2m\u2217 and frequencies of the oneparticle confining potential U . The Hamiltonian for relative motion in cylindrical coordinates\ntakes the form\nHrel =\n\n\u0011 \u03bc\nk\nl2\n1 \u0010 2\n2\n)+\n\u2212 \u03c9L lz ,\np\u03c112 + 2z + p2z12 + (\u03a92 \u03c1212 + \u03c9z2 z12\n2\u03bc\n2\nr\n\u03c112\n12\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03bc = m\u2217 /2 is the reduced mass, lz (\u2192 \u2212ih\u0304\u2202/\u2202\u03c612 ) is the projection of angular momentum\n2 1/2 .\n2\n2 )1/2 , \u03c6\nfor relative motion and \u03c112 = (x212 + y12\n12 = arctan(y12 /x12 ), r12 = (\u03c112 + z12 )\nHere, \u03c9L = eB/2m\u2217c is the Larmor frequency, and the effective lateral confinement frequency\n\u03a9 = (\u03c9L2 + \u03c902 )1/2 depends through \u03c9L on the magnetic field.\nThe total two-electron wave function \u03a8(r1 , r2 ) = \u03c8(r1 , r2 )\u03c7(\u03c31 , \u03c32 ) is a product of the orbital\n\u03c8(r1 , r2 ) and spin \u03c7(\u03c31 , \u03c32 ) wave functions. Due to the Kohn theorem, the orbital wave function\nis factorized as a product of the CM and the relative motion wave functions\n\u03c8(r1 , r2 ) = \u03c8CM (R) \u03c8rel (r12 ).\n\n(3)\n\nAccording to the Pauli principle, the orbital wave function must be symmetric (or,\nequivalently, \u03c8rel (r12 ) must be even) for the antisymmetric (singlet: S = MS = 0) spin state, and\nit must be antisymmetric (\u03c8rel (r12 ) must be odd) for the symmetric (triplet: S = 1, MS = 0, \u00b11)\nspin states. Thus, for the relative motion the parity of \u03c8rel (r12 ) is a good quantum number as\nwell as the magnetic quantum number m, since lz is the integral of motion.\nThe CM eigenfunction is a product of the Fock-Darwin state (the eigenstate of electron\nin an isotropic 2D harmonic oscillator potential under a perpendicular magnetic field) [12]\n\n\fin the (X, Y )-plane and the oscillator function in the Z-direction (both sets for a particle of\nmass M). In this paper we consider the lowest\nCM eigenstate which has the form \u03c8CM (R) =\nq\n(xy)\n\n(z)\n\n(xy)\n\n2\n\n2\n\n(z)\n\n2\n\n\u03c8CM (X, Y ) \u03c8CM (Z), where \u03c8CM (X, Y ) = 2\u03a9\u0304/\u03c0 e\u2212\u03a9\u0304(X +Y ) and \u03c8CM (Z) = (2\u03c9\u0304z /\u03c0)1/4 e\u2212\u03c9\u0304z Z\n(i.e. zero principle quantum numbers), with \u03a9\u0304 = m\u2217 \u03a9/h\u0304 and \u03c9\u0304z = m\u2217 \u03c9z /h\u0304.\nSince the Coulomb interaction mixes the eigenstates of non-interacting electrons, the\neigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian for relative motion (2) are expanded in the basis of the\nFock-Darwin states \u03a6n,m(\u03c112 , \u03c612 ) and oscillator functions in the z12 -direction \u03c6nz (z12 ) (for a\nparticle of mass \u03bc), i.e.\n\u03c8rel (r12 ) =\n\nX\n\n(m)\ncn,n\n\u03a6n,m (\u03c112 , \u03c612 ) \u03c6nz (z12 ).\nz\n\n(4)\n\nn,nz\n(m)\n\nThe coefficients cn,nz can be determined by diagonalizing the Hamiltonian (2) in the same\nbasis. Evidently, in numerical analysis the basis is restricted to a finite set {\u03a6n,m \u03c6nz | n =\n}. It must be, however, large enough to provide a good convergence\n0, . . . , nmax ; nz = 0, . . . , nmax\nz\nfor the numerical results. Since the function \u03c8rel (r12 ) has a definite parity and the parity of\nthe functions \u03a6n,m \u03c6nz is (\u22121)m+nz , the index nz in the expansion (4) takes either even or odd\nvalues.\nFor non-interacting electrons (k = 0) the eigenfunctions \u03c8rel are simply the basis functions\n\u03a6n,m \u03c6nz , and, therefore, the ground state is described by the wave function \u03c8rel = \u03a60,0 \u03c60 .\nWhen two interacting electron move in the external field created by the confining potential and\nthe applied, varying steadily, magnetic field, the quantum number m of the ground state (in\nthe form (4)) evolves from zero to higher values as the magnetic field strength increases. It\nresults in the well known singlet-triplet transitions [13]. Namely, for a given m the dominant\nterm in the expansion (4) will be \u03a60,m \u03c60 (\u21d2 all nz are even) and the parity of the ground state\nis (\u22121)m , which determines the total spin to be S = 12 [1 \u2212 (\u22121)m ]. Note that the quantum\nnumber MS associated with the spin wave function evolves as following: for even m the total\nspin S = 0 and, thus, MS = 0; for odd m the total spin S = 1 and MS can be \u22121, 0 or 1. The\nZeeman splitting (with g\u2217 < 0) will lower the energy of the MS = 1 component of the triplet\nstates, while leaving the singlet states unchanged. As a consequence, the ground state will be\ncharacterized by MS = S. With the increasing magnetic field the intervals of the triplet states\nwill increase at the cost of the singlet ones, and eventually, the singlet ground states will be\ntotally suppressed. The increase of the magnetic field leads to the formation of a ring and a\ntorus of maximal density in 2D- and 3D-densities, respectively (see Fig. 4 in Ref.[14]).\nAt the value \u03c9Lsph = (\u03c9z2 \u2212 \u03c902 )1/2 the magnetic field gives rise to the spherical symmetry\n(\u03c9z /\u03a9 = 1) (with \u03c9z > \u03c90 ) in the axially-symmetric two-electron QD [9, 10]. This phenomenon\nwas also recognized in the results for many interacting electrons in self-assembled QDs [15].\nIn the later case it was interpreted as an approximate symmetry that had survived from the\nnon-interacting case due to the dominance of the confinement energy over a relatively small\nCoulomb interaction energy. However, the symmetry is not approximate but exact even for\nstrongly interacting electrons, because the radial electron-electron repulsion does not break the\nrotational symmetry. A natural question arises how to detect such a transition looking on the\ndensity distribution only. The related question is, if such a transition occurs, what are the\nconcomitant structural changes?\nTo this end we employ the entanglement measure based on the linear entropy of reduced\ndensity matrices (cf [16])\n2\n2\n(5)\n] Tr[\u03c1r(spin) ],\nE = 1 \u2212 2 Tr[\u03c1(orb)\nr\n(orb)\n\n(spin)\n\nwhere \u03c1r\nand \u03c1r\nare the single-particle reduced density matrices in the orbital and spin\nspaces, respectively.

Analysis of results\nThe strongest correlations are expected for the states with m = 0, since they are not affected\nby the orbital electron motion which weakens the Coulomb interaction. In the absence of the\nmagnetic field (B = 0) the entanglement decreases if the ratio \u03c9z /\u03c90 decreases from \u221e (2D\nmodel) to 1 (spherically symmetric 3D model); see Fig. 1(a) at \u03c9L /\u03c90 = 0. This effect could be\nexplained by introducing the effective charge keff [9, 18] which determines the effective electronelectron interaction VC = keff /\u03c112 in the QD. In the 3D dot the electrons can avoid each other\nmore effectively than in the 2D one. Therefore, the Coulomb interaction has a smaller effect on\nthe 3D spectrum (the ratio keff /k \u223c 0.5) in contrast to the 2D case when keff /k = 1. Thus, a\ndecreasing of the ratio \u03c9z /\u03c90 yields an analogous effect as the reduction of the electron-electron\ninteraction.\nFig. 1(a) shows the entanglement measure E of the lowest angular momentum state m = 0 as\na function of the magnetic field (the parameter \u03c9L /\u03c90 ) at a fixed value of RW and for different\nratios \u03c9z /\u03c90 . In the 2D case the entanglement decreases monotonically with the increase of\nthe magnetic field. The constant electron-electron interaction becomes relatively weaker, since\nthe effective lateral confinement (h\u0304\u03a9) increases with the\np magnetic field. If we introduce the\ncharacteristic length of the effective confinement l\u03a9 = h\u0304/m\u2217 \u03a9, the parameter R\u03a9 = l\u03a9 /a\u2217\n(which is equal RW at B = 0) determines the relative strength of Coulomb interaction at a\ngiven effective confinement. Evidently, R\u03a9 decreases with the increase of the magnetic field B\n(see Fig. 1(b), the line labelled by '2D'). In the 3D case, however, the entanglement decreases\nuntil \u03c9L = \u03c9Lsph , when the spherical symmetry occurs. After this point the entanglement starts\nto increase (see Fig. 1(a)).\nThis behaviour can be explained by the influence of magnetic field on the effective strength\nR\u03a9 , which is twofold here. Indeed, in the 3D case the magnetic field affects the effective charge\nas well as the effective confinement. For the quasi-2D system of electrons (\u03a9\nq \u226a \u03c9z ) the effective\n(2D)\n\n2 is the full\ncharge is keff = h\u03c112 VC i (see Eq. (18) in Ref. [18]), where VC = k/ \u03c1212 + z12\n3D Coulomb interaction. The mean value h\u03c112 VC i is calculated by means of the eigenstates\nof Hrel in the approximation of non-interacting electrons. Here, the eigenstate is \u03a60,m \u03c60 (for\n\n\fexplicit expressions see Eqs. (19),(20) in Ref. [18]). Thus, for the quasi-2D case the parameter\n(2D)\n(2D)\nR\u03a9 = (m\u2217 /h\u03043 \u03a9)1/2 keff can be used as a measure for the relative strength of the Coulomb\ninteraction.\nFor \u03a9 \u226b \u03c9z (very strong magnetic field) the electrons are pushed laterally towards the\ndot's center. The magnetic field, however, does not affect the vertical confinement. As a\nconsequence the electrons practically can move only in the z-direction and the QD becomes a\nquasi-1D system. In this case a measure for the relative strength of Coulomb interaction can\n(1D)\n(1D)\nbe defined as R\u03a9\n= (m\u2217 /h\u03043 \u03c9z )1/2 keff , where the effective charge for a quasi-1D system\n(1D)\nis keff = h|z12 |VC i. It can be shown that for the lowest state with m = 0 one obtains\np\n(1D)\nkeff /k = (1 + \u03c9z /\u03a9)\u22121 .\n(1D)\n(2D)\nThe quantities R\u03a9 and R\u03a9 for the lowest state with m = 0, as functions of the parameter\n\u03c9L /\u03c90 (in the domains 0 < \u03c9L < \u03c9Lsph and \u03c9L > \u03c9Lsph , respectively), are shown in Fig. 1(b) for\n(2D)\ndifferent ratios \u03c9z /\u03c90 . One observes that the effective strength R\u03a9 decreases with the increase\nof the magnetic field for different ratios \u03c9z /\u03c90 , similar to the 2D case. The oppositely ordered\nconfinement \u03a9(1D) (which is not defined for the 2D case) increases with \u03c9L and, therefore, the\n(2D)\n(1D)\n(1D)\neffective strength R\u03a9 increases as well. In order to match R\u03a9 = R\u03a9 at \u03c9L = \u03c9Lsph (i.e.\n(1D)\nwhen \u03a9 = \u03c9z ) the strength R\u03a9 is scaled by the factor \u03c0/2. Although at this point the 3D\n(1D)\n(2D)\nsystem is far from the 2D model and from the 1D model and, as a consequence, R\u03a9 and R\u03a9\ndo not match smoothly, these two functions taken together give a qualitative picture how the\neffective electron-electron interaction in a 3D QD changes with the magnetic field.\nThe minimum of entanglement for the lowest state with m = 0 at \u03a9 = \u03c9z can be associated\nwith the condition\nof equivalence of the oscillator scales in the lateral and vertical confinements:\np\nh\u0304/m\u2217 \u03c9z . These quantities can be understood as the amplitudes of electron\nl\u03a9 \u2261 lz =\noscillations in the \u03c1 and z-directions, respectively, for single-particle states with n\u03c1 = 0 and\nnz = 0 [18]. At this point the effective Coulomb interaction becomes isotropic, which results in\nthe small mixing of single-particle states, in contrast to the 2D and 1D cases. This result can be\nreadily extended for the infinite square well potential in the z-direction. In this case lz \u2248 d/2; d is\nthe thickness of semiconductor layer where the dot is created (see Fig.1 in Ref. [18])). Therefore,\nthe minimum of entanglement is expected at lq\n\u03a9 = d/2 which defines the value of the magnetic\nfield by means of the Larmor frequency \u03c9L = (4h\u0304/m\u2217 d2 )2 \u2212 \u03c902 .\nTo get deep insight into this transition we calculate the probability density |\u03c8(r12 )|2 and\npotential surfaces for various values of the magnetic field (see Fig. 2). Since the symmetry\nis exact for any strength of the electron-electron interaction at the transition point, in order\nto illuminate the effect, we use RW = 10. For the magnetic field \u03c9L < \u03c9Lsph the density\nmaximum is located in the (x12 , y12 )-plane (z12 = 0, see Fig. 2(a)). For \u03c9L > \u03c9Lsph , however,\nthere are two maxima located symmetrically along the z12 -axis (\u03c112 = 0, see Fig. 2(c)). The\n2 ) + k/r\nanalysis of the behaviour of the stationary point of the potential V = 12 \u03bc(\u03a92 \u03c1212 + \u03c9z2 z12\n12\nas a function of the magnetic field provides the explanation. For \u03c9L < \u03c9Lsph (\u03a9 < \u03c9z ) the\nstationary point \u03c112 = \u03c10 , z12 = 0 is the minimum of the potential surface (see Fig. 2(d)).\nHere \u03c10 = (k/\u03bc\u03a92 )1/3 [19]. By increasing the magnetic field over the value Bsph (\u03a9 > \u03c9z )\nthe stationary point transforms to the saddle point and two new minima appear, divided by a\npotential barrier (see Fig. 2(f)). In other words, for m = 0 a bifurcation of the stationary point\nlocated at (\u03c10 , 0) occurs at the value of magnetic field when \u03c9L = \u03c9Lsph (see Fig. 2(b,e)). In the\ndomain \u03a9 > \u03c9z , for m = 0, the minima are located at z12 = \u00b1z0 in the z12 -axis (\u03c112 = 0), where\nz0 = (k/\u03bc\u03c9z2 )1/3 . Similar behavior is observed for the states with m 6= 0. However, the effect is\nless prominent due to weakening of correlations by the orbital electron motion.\n\n\f(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\n(e)\n\n(f)\n\n3\n\nz\n\n\u221a 12 0\n2 l0\n\n-3\n0\n\n3\n\u221a\n\n6\n\n\u03c112 / 2 l0\n\nFigure 2.

Conclusions\nSummarizing, we have shown that the 3D approach provides a consistent description of the shape\ntransition in the excited states of two-electron QDs under the magnetic field. The entanglement\nof the lowest state with m = 0, being first a decreasing function of the magnetic field, starts\nto increase after the transition point with the increase of the magnetic field. This behaviour is\nunderstood as the transition from the lateral to the vertical localization of the two-electron\nprobability density for this state, which becomes prominent at strong Coulomb interaction\n(RW \u226b 2).\nAcknowledgments\nThis work is partly supported by RFBR Grant No.11-02-00086 (Russia), Project 171020 of\nMinistry of Education and Science of Serbia, Spanish MICINN Grant No. FIS2008-00781, and\nProject FQM-2445 of the Junta de Andalucia (Spain).\nReferences\n[1] Amico L, Fazio R, Osterloh A and Vedral V 2008 Rev.
