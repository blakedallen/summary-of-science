The paper is organized as following. Section II\ndiscusses semiclassical catastrophes in the dynamics of\na driven quantum rotor with the help of a simple twodimensional model [18]. Section III applies these generic\nresults to a thermal system of cold atoms driven by a\npulsed optical lattice [19]. Section IV focuses on 3D effects important in the processes of molecular alignment\nand orientation by strong laser pulses [20].\n\nSemiclassical catastrophes in the dynamics of a quantum\nrotor (molecule) driven by a strong time-varying field are considered.

TWO-DIMENSIONAL ROTOR\n\nPACS numbers: 42.50.-p, 42.50.Vk, 32.80.Pj, 33.80.-b\n\nFor the sake of clarity, we start with the simplest\nmodel of a two-dimensional rotor described by the timedependent Hamiltonian\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nb2\nb = L + V (\u03b8, t)\nH\n2I\n\nDriven rotor is a standard model in classical and quantum nonlinear dynamics studies [1]. Increasing interest\nin the problem has arisen because of recent atom optics realization of the quantum \u03b4-kicked rotor [2,3], and\nnovel experiments on molecule orientation (alignment) by\nstrong laser fields [4\u20137]. A strong enough laser field creates the so-called pendular molecular states [8\u201310] that\nare hybrids of field-free rotor eigenstates. By adiabatically turning on the laser field, it is possible to trap a\nmolecule in the ground pendular state, thus leading to\nmolecular alignment. The only way to reach a considerable degree of alignment in this approach is by increasing the intensity of the field. However, many applications may require only a transient molecular alignment\n(orientation), where the molecular angular distribution\nbecomes extremely squeezed at some predetermined moment of time. It is well known that a physically related\nproblem of squeezed states generation in a harmonic system may be solved by a proper time-modulation of the\ndriving force (parametric resonance excitation). Behavior of a rotor in general, strong, time-varying fields is\na much less-studied problem, although it is understood\nthat the long-persisting beats in the molecular angular\ndistribution may be induced by short laser pulses [11\u201317].\nIn the present paper, we analyze generic features in\nthe dynamics of a quantum rotor driven by strong pulses,\nand present a strategy for efficient squeezing of the rotor\nangular distribution by a sequence of pulses of moderate intensity. The results of our research are related to\na number of physical processes, ranging from molecular\n\n(1)\n\nb is the angular momentum operator, and I is the\nwhere L\nmomentum of inertia of the rotor. This model contains\nmost of the physics we want to present here. Some important additional effects that appear in 3D will be discussed\nbelow in Section IV. For a \"linear 2D molecule\" having\na permanent dipole moment \u03bc, and driven by a linearly\npolarized field, the interaction potential is\nV (\u03b8, t) = \u2212\u03bcE(t) cos(\u03b8)\n\n(2)\n\nwhere E(t) is the field amplitude (i. e., of a half-cycle\npulse), and \u03b8 is the polar angle between the molecular\naxis and the field direction. In the absence of interaction with a permanent dipole moment, the external field\nmay couple with induced anisotropic molecular polarization. This interaction (being averaged over fast optical\noscillations) may result in the interaction potential proportional to cos2 (\u03b8) (see Eq.(17) in Section IV) [21]. Although these two forms of V (\u03b8, t) may lead to different\nphysical consequences (i. e., orientation vs alignment),\nthe effects we will present are more or less insensitive to\nthe choice of interaction. Therefore, we prefer to start\nwith the more simple situation described by Eq.(2).\nBy introducing dimensionless time \u03c4 = th\u0304/I, and interaction strength \u03b5 = \u03bcE(t)I/h\u03042 , the Hamiltonian can\nbe written as\n\n1\n\n2\nb = \u2212 1 \u2202 \u2212 \u03b5(\u03c4 ) cos(\u03b8)\nH\n2 \u2202\u03b82\n\n\fThe wave function of the system can be expanded in the\neigenfunctions of a free rotor\n\nthe help of the following semiclassical arguments. Consider an ensemble of randomly oriented classical rotors\nsubject to a kick. The angular velocity of a rotor located\nat the angle \u03b8 is\n\n+\u221e\nX\n1\ncn (\u03c4 )ein\u03b8\n\u03a8(\u03b8, \u03c4 ) = \u221a\n2\u03c0 n=\u2212\u221e\n\n\u03c9(\u03b8) = \u2212P sin(\u03b8)\n\nIn the absence of the field, the wave function takes the\nform\n+\u221e\nX\n2\n1\ncn (0)e\u2212in \u03c4 /2+in\u03b8\n\u03a8(\u03b8, \u03c4 ) = \u221a\n2\u03c0 n=\u2212\u221e\n\njust after the kick, assuming negligible initial velocity.\nFor rotors from the region of small \u03b8 << 1, the acquired\nvelocity is linearly proportional to their initial angle, so\nthat all of them arrive at the focal point \u03b8 = 0 at the\nsame time\n\n(3)\n\n\u03c4f = 1/P.\n\nDespite a simple form of Eq.(3), the wave function exhibits extremely rich space-time dynamics. In particular, it shows periodic behavior in time with the period\nTrev = 4\u03c0 (full revival) and a number of fractional revivals at \u03c4 = p/sTrev (p and s are mutually prime numbers) [22]. An analytical solution valid for a general timedependent field is unknown even for this simplest model.\nMuch effort has been devoted to the case of extremely\nshort field pulses (\u03b4\u2212kicks) (see, e. g. [1], and references\ntherein). In general, as a result of a single kick applied\nto the rotor at \u03c4 = \u03c4k , the coefficients cn transform as\ncn (\u03c4k + 0) =\n\n+\u221e\nX\n\nm=\u2212\u221e\n\nin\u2212m Jn\u2212m (P )cm (\u03c4k \u2212 0),\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\nThis phenomenon is quite similar to the focusing of light\nrays by a thin optical lens. For P >> 1, the shape of\nthe distribution at the focusing time \u03c4f is dictated by\nthe aberration mechanism (deviation of the cos(\u03b8) potential from the parabolic one), and it is P -independent.\nWe consider the orientation factor O =< 1 \u2212 cos(\u03b8) >\n(where angular brackets mean averaging over the state\nof rotor) as a measure of the rotor orientation. For large\nenough P, the time-dependent orientation factor (for the\ninitial s-state) may be easily estimated by averaging over\nthe initially uniform classical ensemble of rotors having\nthe velocity distribution of Eq. (5): O(\u03c4 ) = 1 \u2212 J1 (P \u03c4 ).\nHere J1 (x) is Bessel function of the first order. The minimal value O \u2248 0.418 of the orientation factor is, in fact,\nachieved in the post-focusing regime, at \u03c4 \u2248 1.84\u03c4f . As\nseen in Fig. 1 (c), a new phenomenon can be observed in\nthe angular probability distribution just after the focusing. Sharp singular-like features are formed in the distribution, which are moving with time. Each of these features has a typical asymmetric shape, with pronounced\noscillations on one side and an abrupt drop down on the\nother side. Again, the origin of this effect can be traced\nin the time evolution of a classical ensemble of initially\nmotionless rotors.\nAfter a kick applied at \u03c4 = 0, the motion of the rotors\nis described by\n\n(4)\n\nwhere\n+\u221e\nZ\nP =\n\u03b5(\u03c4 )d\u03c4,\n\u2212\u221e\n\nand Jn (P ) is the Bessel function of the nth order. The result of multiple kicks applied at different times can be obtained by combining transformations (4) after each kick\nwith a free evolution according to Eq.(3) between the\nkicks. If the kicks are applied periodically to the system\nwith the period Trev , the system does not show chaotic\nbehavior, and the energy accumulates quadratically with\ntime (the so-called \"quantum resonance\" [23,24]). It is,\ntherefore, quite natural to examine potential accumulation of angular squeezing of the rotor wave function under\nthe \"quantum resonance\" excitation. In this case, because of the exact quantum revivals at the free-evolution\nstages, the effect of N kicks of a magnitude P is equivalent to the action of a single strong pulse of strength N P\n(see, e. g. [23]). In Figure 1, we show numerically calculated time evolution of the probability density |\u03a8(\u03b8, \u03c4 )|2\nafter a relatively strong kick of a magnitude P = 85\napplied at \u03c4 = 0. Initially the rotor was in the ground\ns-state (cn (0) = \u03b4n0 ). For the chosen values of \u03c4 , several\ndistinct phenomena can be seen in these plots. First of\nall, the wave function shows an extreme narrowing in the\nregion of small \u03b8 after some delay following the kick [Fig.\n1 (b)]. The physics of this effect may be understood with\n\n\u03b8 = \u03b80 \u2212 P sin(\u03b80 )\u03c4 (mod 2\u03c0)\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u03b80 is the initial angle. For \u03c4 < \u03c4f Eq.(7) represents\na one-to-one mapping \u03b8(\u03b80 ) [see Fig. 2 (a)]. At \u03c4 = \u03c4f\nthe curve \u03b8(\u03b80 ) touches the horizontal axis [Fig. 2 (b)].\nAt \u03c4 > \u03c4f the angle \u03b80 becomes a multi-valued function of\n\u03b8 [Figs. 2 (c), (d)]. The classical time-dependent angular\ndistribution function of the ensemble is given by\nf (\u03b8, \u03c4 ) =\n\nX f (\u03b8a , \u03c4 = 0)\n0\na\n|d\u03b8/d\u03b8\n0|\na\n\n(8)\n\nThe summation in Eq. (8) is performed over all possible\nbranches of the function \u03b80 (\u03b8) defined by Eq.(7). It follows immediately from Eq.(8) that even for a smooth initial distribution, f (\u03b8, \u03c4 ) may exhibit a singular behavior\n2\n\n\fnear the angles where d\u03b8/d\u03b80a \u2192 0. The quantum nature\nof the rotor motion replaces the classical singularities by\nsharp maxima in the probability distribution with the\nAiry-like shape typical to rainbow phenomena. Indeed,\nthis effect is similar to the formation of caustics in the\nwave optics [25], and rainbow-type scattering in optics\nand quantum mechanics [26\u201328]. We should stress, however, that the long-time asymptotic regimes are radically\ndifferent for the classical and truly quantum motion of\nthe rotor. Thus, contrary to the classical limit, in which\nthe caustics exist forever, they gradually disappear in the\nquantum case because of the overall decay of the initial\nrotational wave packet. On even longer time scale, another quantum phenomenon can be seen, namely revivals\nand fractional revivals of the initial classical-like motion.\nFigs. 1 (e)-(i) show several examples of fractional foci and\nrainbows in the angular distribution, which is a purely\nquantum effect.\nAs we have demonstrated, a mere application of\n\u03b4\u2212kicks at the condition of \"quantum resonance\" does\nnot lead to accumulated angular squeezing, and the orientation is saturated at some finite asymptotic level. Here\nwe suggest an excitation scheme that exhibits the desired accumulation property. As previously mentioned,\nthe wave function of the rotor reaches the state of the\nmaximal orientation (i. e., minimal O value) after a certain delay \u2206\u03c41 following the application of the first kick\nat \u03c4 = \u03c41 = 0. We suggest to apply the second kick at\n\u03c42 = \u2206\u03c41 . Immediately after the second kick, the system will keep the same probability density distribution.\nOn the other hand, \u03c4 = \u03c42 will no longer be a stationary point for O(\u03c4 ) =< 1 \u2212 cos(\u03b8) > (\u03c4 ). The orientation\nfactor O(\u03c4 ), and its derivative are continuous and periodic functions of time in the course of a free evolution.\nTherefore, O(\u03c4 ) will reach a new minimum at some point\n\u03c42 + \u2206\u03c42 in the interval [\u03c42 , \u03c42 + Trev ]. Clearly, the new\nminimal value of the orientation factor is smaller than\nthe previous one. By continuing this way, we will apply\nshort kicks at iterative time instants \u03c4k+1 = \u03c4k + \u2206\u03c4k .\nBy construction of this pulse sequence, the squeezing effect will accumulate with time, in contrast to the \"quantum resonance\" excitation. This is demonstrated by\nFig. 3, which shows calculated sequences {\u2206\u03c4k } and\n{< 1 \u2212 cos(\u03b8) > (\u03c4k )} for a rotor initially in the s-state\nand being kicked by pulses with P = 3. The logarithm\nof the orientation factor gradually decreases, without any\nsign of saturation.\nAt the stage of a well-developed squeezing (O << 1),\nthe cos(\u03b8) -potential may be approximated by a parabolic\none. It can be easily shown (both classically and quantum mechanically) that in this limit our strategy provides the following recurrent relationships for the time\nintervals \u2206\u03c4k , successive values of the angular variance\nuk =< \u03b82 >k \u2248 2Ok and normalized variance of the angular velocity wk =< (\u2212id/d\u03b8)2 >k /P 2 :\n\n\u2206\u03c4k =\n\nuk\nuk + wk\n\nu2k\nuk + wk\n= wk + uk\n\nuk+1 = uk \u2212\nwk+1\n\n(9)\n\nFor large k, the last two finite-difference equations may\nbe replaced by a system of coupled differential equations.\nThe latter has an exact solution\n\u221a providing the following\nasymptotics: < \u03b82 >k \u221d 1/ k and \u2206\u03c4k \u221d 1/k. This\nresult is in good agreement with the numerically observed\npower-laws behavior of the graphs 3 (a) and 3 (b), and\nit describes correctly their slopes at k >> 1. We note,\nthat in contrast to the wave optics (in which the size\nof the focal spot is diffraction limited), our system may\nbe, in principle, \"unlimitedly\" squeezed in angle. We\nalso note that a quasi-periodic sequence of kicks applied\nat \u03c4k+1 = \u03c4k + \u2206\u03c4k + Trev provides the same squeezing\nscenario for a quantum rotor. The introduction of the\nTrev -shift between pulses may be useful in the practical\nrealizations of the scenario to avoid the overlap between\nshort excitation pulses of a finite duration.\n\nIII. SQUEEZING OF ATOMS IN A PULSED\nOPTICAL LATTICE\n\nIn the present Section we apply the above results to\nanother well-known system : cold atoms interacting with\na pulsed optical lattice [19]. Optical lattices are periodic\npotentials for neutral atoms induced by standing light\nwaves formed by counter-propagating laser beams. When\nthese waves are detuned from any atomic resonance, the\nac Stark shift of the ground atomic state leads to a conservative periodic potential with spatial period \u03bb/2, half\nthe laser wavelength (for a review, see, e. g. [29]). Such\nlattices present a convenient model systems for solid state\nphysics and nonlinear dynamics studies. In contrast to\ntraditional solid state objects, the parameters of optical\nlattices (i. e. lattice constant, potential well depth, etc.)\nare easily controllable. Many fine phenomena that were\nlong discussed in solid state physics, have been recently\nobserved in corresponding atom optics systems. Bloch\noscillations [30], or the Wannier-Stark ladder [31,32] are\nonly few examples to mention. Time-modulation of the\nfrequency and intensity of the constituent laser beams\nprovide tools for effective modeling of numerous timedependent nonlinear phenomena. Since the initial proposal [33], and first pioneering experiments on atom optics realization of the \u03b4-kicked quantum rotor [2], cold\natoms in optical lattices provide also new grounds for\nexperiments on quantum chaos.\nWe describe atoms as two-level systems with transition\nfrequency \u03c90 , interacting with a standing optical wave\nthat is linearly polarized and has the frequency of \u03c9l .\nIf the detuning \u2206l = \u03c90 \u2212 \u03c9l is large compared to the\n3\n\n\ftemperatures. It can be seen, that after the first few kicks\nthe localization factor demonstrates a negative power dependence as a function of the kick number (a straight line\nin the double logarithmic scale). Although, the system\ndemonstrates a reduced squeezing for higher initial temperatures, the slope of all of the curves in Figure 5 is\nthe same after the first several kicks, in full agreement\nwith the general arguments of the previous Section (see\nEqs.(9). Therefore, the accumulative squeezing scenario\nmay be an effective and regular strategy for atomic localization even at finite temperatures.\nHowever, this does not mean that the accumulative\nsqueezing is the only one (or the most effective) squeezing\nstrategy. We have studied the best localization that can\nbe achieved with a given number of identical \u03b4-kicks, by\nminimizing the localization factor Eq.(11) with respect\nto the delay times \u2206\u03c4n between the kicks. For clarity,\nwe present here only the results for zero initial temperature of the atoms. Table 1 shows the best values of the\nlocalization factor found for up to five kicks, and compares them with the results of the accumulative squeezing strategy with the same number of kicks. While the\nmaximal atomic localization that can be achieved with\ntwo pulses is almost the same for accumulative squeezing\nand for the optimal sequence of two pulses, the optimized\nresults for three and more pulses are much better.\nFor illustration, we choose the sequence of four optimal\npulses to visualize the dynamics behind the localization\nprocess. Figure 6 (a) shows the spatial distribution of\nthe ensemble of atoms at the time of arrival of the second pulse. Note that the second pulse is not applied\nat the time of the maximal localization. On the contrary, the optimized procedure finds it favorable to wait\nafter the focusing event, until the distribution becomes\nrather broad. The optimal four-pulse sequence we found\nrequires applying the third and the forth pulses simultaneously, thus producing an effective \"double pulse\". The\nspatial distribution at the time of the combined third and\nfourth pulses can be seen in Figure 6 (b). The distribution is only slightly more localized than in Fig. 6(a), and\nonly the last pulse (with the double strength) squeezes\nthe ensemble at the time of the maximal localization,\nthus bringing most of the atoms to the optical lattice\nminima [see Fig. 6 (c)].\n\nrelaxation rate of the excited atomic state, the internal\nstructure of the atoms can be neglected and they can be\nregarded as point-like particles. In this approximation,\nthe Hamiltonian for the atomic motion is\nH(x, p, t) =\n\np2\n\u2212 V (t) cos (2kl x) ,\n2m\n\n(10)\n\nwhere m is the atomic mass, kl = \u03c9l /c is the wave number of the standing wave. The depth of the potential\nproduced by the standing wave is V (t) = h\u0304\u03a9(t)2 /8\u2206l ,\nwhere \u03a9(t) = 2|dz E(t)|/h\u0304 is the Rabi frequency, d~ is the\natomic dipole moment and E(t) is the time-dependent\namplitude of the light field. In the case of rather short\nlaser pulses, this Hamiltonian corresponds to that of the\ntwo-dimensional \u03b4-kicked rotor considered in the previous\nSection, with \u03b8 = 2kl x. In accordance with the previous\ndiscussion, many aspects of the dynamics of this system\ncan be explained with semiclassical arguments. Here we\nprovide results for a classical description of atoms in a\npulsed optical lattice, with thermal effects taken into account.\nWe performed a Monte-Carlo simulation of the dynamics of an ensemble of \u03b4-kicked particles which were initially uniformly distributed in space and had a thermal\nmomentum distribution. Figure 4 shows the spatial distribution of atoms at different times after a single kick.\nIn the upper row, the initial temperature of the ensemble is zero, and we can observe focusing [Fig. 4(a)] and\nformation of caustics [Fig. 4(b)] as it was described in\nSection II. In Fig. 4(c) and (d), the average thermal energy of the initial ensemble is comparable with the energy\nsupplied by a kick. As a result, instead of sharp peaks\nin the spatial distribution (like in Figure 4 (a) and (b)),\nwe observe some broader spatial structures that are still\nreminiscent of the focusing phenomenon and the rainbow\neffect.\nWe examined the accumulative squeezing approach in\napplication to the above system. The angular localization factor O =< 1 \u2212 cos (2kl x) > introduced in Section\nII describes now the spatial width of atomic groups localized in the minima of the light-induced potential. In\nthe classical limit, the localization factor after applying\nn kicks is given by\nZ \u221e\nZ \u03c0\n1\nO(tn ) = 1 \u2212\nd\u03c90\nd\u03b80 \u03c1(\u03c90 ) cos \u03b8n ,\n(11)\n2\u03c0 \u2212\u221e\n\u2212\u03c0\n\nIV. ORIENTATION AND ALIGNMENT OF A 3D\nROTOR\n\nwhere \u03b8n is determined by\n\u03b8n = \u03b8n\u22121 + \u2206\u03c4n\n\n\u03c90 \u2212\n\nn\u22121\nX\ni=0\n\nsin \u03b8i\n\n!\n\n.\n\nUnder certain conditions, the process of molecular orientation (or alignment) by laser fields can be described\nby a strongly driven three-dimensional rigid rotor model.\nAlthough many features in the dynamics of 3D rotors are\nsimilar to those already discussed for the two-dimensional\ncase, there are two principal differences that we want to\nemphasize. The first one may be traced in the evolution\n\n(12)\n\nHere, \u03c90 = 2kl v0 , where v0 is the initial velocity of an\natom, and \u03c1(\u03c90 ) describes the thermal distribution of\nthe velocities. Figure 5 displays the amount of spatial\nsqueezing for the series of 100 kicks for different initial\n4\n\n\fof a classical ensemble of 3D-rotors being initially at zero\ntemperature. The probability of finding a rotor (driven\nby a linearly polarized field) at a certain solid angle element sin \u03b8d\u03b8 is determined by the initial distribution\nfunction, f0 (\u03b80 ) as follows:\nf (\u03b8) sin \u03b8d\u03b8 = f0 (\u03b80 ) sin \u03b80 d\u03b80 .\n\nplotted on a sphere. Red color corresponds to the high\nprobability density while the blue color presents a low\nprobability. Initial isotropic ensemble corresponds to an\nuniform solid angle distribution [see Fig. 7 (a)]. In Figure 7 (b), the distribution is plotted at the \"focal time\"\ndefined according to Eq.(6). In the two-dimensional case\nconsidered in the previous Sections, the distribution at\nthe focal time is characterized by a sharp peak at \u03b8 = 0\nand a broad background for larger values of \u03b8. In the\nthree-dimensional case, the distribution has an additional\nsharp dip at \u03b8 = 0, as discussed above. Figures 7 (c) and\n(d) show the angular distribution at t > tf . In Fig. 7\n(c) the formation of the \"corona\" around \u03b8 = 0 can be\nseen. In addition, we can observe a ring of relatively high\nprobability moving from the north pole to the south pole\nof the sphere. This ring is a three-dimensional analog\nof the rainbow structure modified by the thermal effects.\nAfter the ring arrives at the south pole, a singular feature appears around \u03b8 = \u03c0, with a hole in the center\ncaused the repulsive centrifugal force [Fig. 7 (d)]. The\nformation of this sharp and robust structure in the angular distribution is analogous to the glory effect in the\nwave optics.\nAll the described phenomena, namely, focusing, caustics creation, and accumulating squeezing are not specific\nfor the simplest models considered above, but are rather\ncommon features that can be observed under general conditions of a strong excitation of the quantum rotor. Indeed, for strong enough driving field one may neglect the\ninitial rotational energy stored in the rotor, and use the\nabove quasiclassical ideas to describe its dynamics. The\nrole of the initial state of the rotor (even thermally averaged) is reduced to the formation of a frozen classicallike initial angular distribution of the rotational ensemble. For example, for the dipole-type interaction, Eq.\n(2), the angular focusing may be analyzed by considering classical dynamics at small angles (\u03b8 \u226a 1):\n\u0015\n\u0014 2\nd\n+\n\u01eb(\u03c4\n)\n\u03b8 = 0.\n(16)\nd\u03c4 2\n\n(13)\n\nTherefore, the probability density of finding a rotor at\nthe angle \u03b8 at some latter time is\nf (\u03b8) =\n\nX f0 (\u03b8a ) sin \u03b8a\n0\n0\na | sin \u03b8 ,\n|d\u03b8/d\u03b8\n0\na\n\n(14)\n\nwhere the summation is done over all branches of the\n\u03b80 (\u03b8) function (see Section II). The probability density\nf (\u03b8) has a singularity if one of the factors in the denominator is zero. As in the 2D case, the zeroes of the fraction\n|d\u03b8/d\u03b80a | give rise to the formation of the rainbow-like\nstructures. But in addition, the geometrical factor sin \u03b8\ncan get zero too, which leads to the additional singularities at \u03b8 = 0 and \u03b8 = \u03c0. This kind of singularities are\nresponsible for the formation of the corona and glory effects in the optical and quantum-mechanical scattering\n[26,27].\nThe second difference appears at finite initial temperature of the ensemble of 3D rotors. Because of the conservation of the angular momentum projection onto the\nfield polarization direction, an effective repulsive centrifugal force appears that prevents the rotors from reaching\nthe exact \u03b8 = 0 and \u03b8 = \u03c0 orientations. As a result, two\nholes in the angular distribution of a driven 3D thermal\nensemble should be always present at \u03b8 = 0 and \u03b8 = \u03c0\n[34].\nWe present below the results of Monte-Carlo simulation of the dynamics of a classical ensemble of threedimensional rotors (linear molecules) driven by a linearly polarized time-dependent field. The corresponding\nHamiltonian is\n!\np2\u03c6\n1\n2\nH=\np\u03b8 +\n\u2212 \u03bcE(t)r cos \u03b8,\n(15)\n2mr2\nsin2 \u03b8\n\nHere, \u03c4 = th\u0304/I, and \u01eb = \u03bcE(t)I/h\u03042 , and the initial condition is \u03b8(\u03c40 ) = \u03b80 , d\u03b8(\u03c40 )/d\u03c4 = 0 (where \u03c40 is any moment\nin the past before the beginning of the pulse). Focusing\ntime \u03c4f is defined by \u03b8(\u03c4f ) = 0. Because of the linearity of Eq.(16), the position of the focusing times, and\nnumber of focusing events do not depend on \u03b80 , but are\ndetermined only by the properties of the pulse \u01eb(\u03c4 ). This\nboundary problem may be solved analytically in several\nspecial cases only (for \u03b4-pulse considered above, or for\na step-like \u01eb(\u03c4 ) dependence). In general, determination\nof focusing times requires numerical solution of Eq.(16).\nBased on the previous analysis, we expect that a new\nangular rainbow appears immediately after each focusing event.\nFigure 8 shows numerically calculated time-evolution\nof a three-dimensional quantum rotor (linear molecule)\n\nwhere m is the reduced mass of the molecule, r is\nthe (fixed) distance between the atoms, \u03bc is permanent\ndipole moment, \u03b8 and \u03c6 are Euler angles, and p\u03b8 and\np\u03c6 are related canonical momenta. For the driving field\ndescribed by a \u03b4\u2212 pulse, the equations of motion can be\neasily integrated (see [35]).\nAt zero initial temperature, p\u03b80 = 0 and p\u03c60 = 0, and\nthe angle \u03c6(t) is an additional constant of motion. In this\ncase, the dynamics of the system is reduced to that of a\ntwo-dimensional rotor, beside the effect of the geometrical factor described above. Figure 7 demonstrates the\ntime evolution of the angular distribution of an ensemble\nwith finite initial temperature. Here, the probability of\nfinding a rotor inside the solid angle element sin \u03b8d\u03b8d\u03c6 is\n5\n\n\fcoupled to the external laser field via the anisotropic polarization interaction. The time averaged value of this\ninteraction is (see, e. g. [21,9])\nV (\u03b8, t) = \u22121/4E 2(t)[(\u03b1k \u2212 \u03b1\u22a5 ) cos2 (\u03b8) + \u03b1\u22a5 ]\n\n[4] D. Normand, L. A.

In this case there\nare two opposite equilibrium directions \u03b8 = 0, \u03c0, so the\nfield aligns the molecules but not orients them. The applied pulse has a Gaussian shape of a finite duration (i.\ne. it is not a \u03b4-kick). As seen from Fig. 8, both focusing\nand caustics formation occur in the system, similar to the\nprevious consideration, with the differences attributed to\nanother symmetry of the problem. For instance, the angular rainbows are made of moving rings located symmetrically with respect to the equatorial plane. Note,\nthat the glory and corona are not seen because of the\nsin(\u03b8) factor incorporated into the distribution function\nshown in Fig. 8.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\n\nThe predicted effects may be observed in a wide range\nof systems with strongly driven rotational degrees of freedom. Possible examples range from heavy-ion collisions\n(when highly excited wave packets of nuclear rotational\nstates are produced [12]) to molecules subject to strong\nlaser pulses, and cold atoms trapped by standing light\nwaves. The spectacular features described in this paper may be observed in the spatial distribution of an\natomic ensemble driven by pulsed optical lattices. Recently, the accumulated squeezing scenario [18] has been\nrealized experimentally in this system [36]. Moreover,\nthe related squeezing approaches may find application in\natom lithography of ultra-high resolution [37,38]. In the\ncase of molecules, the considered effects may reveal themselves in the angular distribution of fragments produced\nby intense laser-field molecular interaction. The most direct evidence can be achieved in a two-pulse experiment,\nin which the first strong non-resonant pulse attempts to\norient (align) the molecular ensemble, while the second\nshort delayed pulse creates fragment ions.\n\n[1] F.

In (c) and\n\u221e\n(d), kB T = (1/9)kl2 [ \u2212\u221e V (t)dt]2 /m, where V (t) is the\ndepth of the potential produced by the standing wave,\nand kB is Boltzmann constant. Figures (a) and (c) show\nthe spatial distribution at focal time \u03c4 = \u03c4f , while in\nfigure (b) and (c) \u03c4 = 2.5\u03c4f .\nFig. 5. Accumulative squeezing of atoms in a\npulsed optical lattice at finite temperature (classical description). The minimal localization factor as a function of the kick number is shown in double logarithmic scale. The solid line corresponds to zero initial temperature. The dashed\nR \u221e and dotted lines correspond to kB T = (1/9)kl2 [ \u2212\u221e V (t)dt]2 /m and kB T =\nR\u221e\n(4/9)kl2 [ \u2212\u221e V (t)dt]2 /m, respectively.\nFig. 6. Spatial distribution for the optimized sequence\nof four \u03b4-pulses. The upper row shows the spatial distribution averaged over 100 atomic ensembles (each containing 5000 atoms), the lower figures show the distribution of atoms in one of the ensembles. In (a), the distribution is plotted at the time of the second pulse, that\nis delayed by \u03c4 = 3.02\u03c4f with respect to the first pulse,\nin (b) - at the time of the (combined) third and fourth\npulses delayed by \u03c4 = 1.35\u03c4f after the second pulse. Figure (c) shows the distribution of atoms at the time of the\nmaximal squeezing.\n\n7\n\n\fNo of kicks\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\nOacc\n0.33\n0.26\n0.21\n0.18\n\nOopt\n0.31\n0.20\n0.11\n0.07\n\nTABLE I.\n\n8\n\n\f\u0017\n\n\u0003DQJXODU\u0003GLVWULEXWLRQ\n\n\u0016\n\nIRFXVLQJ \u0017\n\n\u0017\nD\n\n\u0016\n\nE\n\n\u0016\n\n\u0015\n\n\u0015\n\n\u0015\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0010\u0016 \u0010\u0015 \u0010\u0014 \u0013\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n\u0016\n\n\u0017\n\u0016\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0010\u0016 \u0010\u0015 \u0010\u0014 \u0013\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n\u0016\n\n\u0017\nG\n\n\u0016\n\n\u0013\n\nH\n\n\u0016\n\n\u0015\n\n\u0015\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n\u0016\n\n\u0017\n\u0016\n\n\u0010\u0016 \u0010\u0015 \u0010\u0014 \u0013\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n\u0016\n\n\u0017\nJ\n\n\u0016\n\nK\n\n\u0016\n\n\u0015\n\n\u0015\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0010\u0016 \u0010\u0015 \u0010\u0014 \u0013\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n\u0016\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0010\u0016 \u0010\u0015 \u0010\u0014 \u0013\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n\u0016\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n\u0016\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n\u0016\n\nI\n\n\u0010\u0016 \u0010\u0015 \u0010\u0014 \u0013\n\n\u0017\n\n\u0015\n\n\u0013\n\nF\n\n\u0017\n\n\u0015\n\n\u0010\u0016 \u0010\u0015 \u0010\u0014 \u0013\n\nUDLQERZ\n\n\u0010\u0016 \u0010\u0015 \u0010\u0014 \u0013\n\n\u0014\n\nDQJOH\u0003T\n\n\u0015\n\n\u0016\n\n\u0013\n\nL\n\n\u0010\u0016 \u0010\u0015 \u0010\u0014 \u0013\n\n\fT\n\n\u0019\n\n\u0019\n\nE\n\nD\n\u0017\n\n\u0017\n\n\u0015\n\n\u0015\n\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\n\u0015\n\n\u0017\n\n\u0019\n\n\u0019\n\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\n\u0015\n\n\u0017\n\n\u0019\n\n\u0019\n\nG\n\nF\n\u0017\n\n\u0017\n\n\u0015\n\n\u0015\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\n\u0015\n\n\u0017\n\n\u0019\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0015\n\n\u0017\n\n\u0019\n\nT\u0013\n\n\fD\n\n\u0003'WN\n\n\u0013\u0011\u0014\n\u0013\u0011\u0013\u0014\n\u0014(\u0010\u0016\n\u0014(\u0010\u0017\n\n\u0014\u0010\u001fFRV T !\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0014\u0013\n\n\u0014\u0013\u0013\n\nE\n\u0013\u0011\u0014\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0014\u0013\n\nNLFN\u0003QXPEHU\n\n\u0014\u0013\u0013\n\n\fThis figure \"Fig4.gif\" is available in \"gif\" format from:\nhttp://arxiv.org/ps/quant-ph/0201051v1\n\n\fThis figure \"Fig5.gif\" is available in \"gif\" format from:\nhttp://arxiv.org/ps/quant-ph/0201051v1\n\n\fThis figure \"Fig6.gif\" is available in \"gif\" format from:\nhttp://arxiv.org/ps/quant-ph/0201051v1\n\n\fThis figure \"Fig7.gif\" is available in \"gif\" format from:\nhttp://arxiv.org/ps/quant-ph/0201051v1\n\n\fThis figure \"Fig8.gif\" is available in \"gif\" format from:\nhttp://arxiv.org/ps/quant-ph/0201051v1\n\n\f"}
