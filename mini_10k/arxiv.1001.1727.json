Introduction\nNEMS are actively being explored due to their incredible potential for applications such as\nultrasensitive mass [1], [2], [3], [4] and force sensing [5]. However, efficient actuation and sensitive\ndetection at the nanoscale remains a challenge. The small displacements of these miniaturized devices\ninduce very low signals which are overwhelmed by parasitic background. A lot of effort has been\ndevoted to develop new transduction and background reduction [6]. A variety of NEMS detection\ntechniques, such as capacitive [3], [7] [8], magnetomotive [9], piezoresistive [10], [11] and fieldemission [4] [12] transduction, have been proposed. Magnetomotive typically requires large magnetic\nfields (2-8 T) and is thus not suitable for integrated applications. The field-emission effect detection\ndemands complex instrumentation and its stability in time is still questionable. Moreover, this\ntechnique uses bottom-up approach that is hardly compatible with large scale integration (VLSI)\nprocess. Piezoresistive detection scheme offers great potential compared to capacitive one especially\nat high resonant frequency measurements [10] [13].\nRecently, mass resolution down to 7 zg / Hz [1] has been demonstrated using a metallic gauge\nlayer deposited on the top of a cantilever. Another approach [14] consists in using a doped silicon\nnanowire that produces a second-order piezoresistive effect for large displacements of the nanowire.\nHowever to date bottom-up nanowire cannot be fabricated using a VLSI process compatible with a\nstandard CMOS technology.\nIn this paper, we demonstrate an original technique of highly efficient in-plane motion detection\nbased on suspended p++ doped piezoresistive nanowires connected in a symmetric bridge\nconfiguration to a resonating lever arm. The differential bridge architecture provides intrinsic signal\namplification and background suppression. We show that detection through silicon gauges has a better\nsignal to noise ratio at room temperature than the metallic layer used as piezoresistive gauge.\nAlthough the Johnson noise is higher with semiconductor nanowire gauges (due to their larger\nresistance) the increase in signal is much larger than the increase in noise. We therefore present an\nalternative way using piezoresistive technique showing similar performance as metallic gauges. We\n\n2\n\n\ftherefore reconsider the belief that metallic gauges are the best candidates for nanoscale piezoresistive\ntransduction.\nIn addition, in-plane motion architecture offers more flexibility of design and simplifies process\ndevelopment. Our device uses CMOS-based fabrication and is therefore fully compatible with very\nlarge scale integration (VLSI) of NEMS on 200mm wafer in the future.\nThis paper starts with an overview of the fabrication process and architecture, continues with\nmeasurements and results, and concludes with a discussion of the efficiency of the detection scheme\nand the frequency stability of these devices.\n\n2. NEMS resonator and principle of operation\n2.1. Device\nAdvances in top-down lithographic processes have enabled fabrication of nanostructures with sizes\nsimilar to those achieved with bottom-up synthesis methods. The NEMS device presented in this\npaper is fabricated using CMOS compatible materials with nano-electronics state-of-the-art\nlithography and etching techniques. We used a 200-mm silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer of (100)\norientation with a 160-nm-thick top silicon structural layer (resistivity \u2248 10 \u03a9*cm) and a 400-nm-thick\nsacrificial oxide layer. The top silicon layer was implanted with boron ions (p-type) through a thin\nlayer of thermal oxide. Homogenous doping (~1019cm-3) in the whole thickness of the top silicon was\nobtained through specific annealing step (for material reconstruction and doping activation commonly\nused in CMOS technology), resulting in top layer resistivity of approximately 9 m\u03a9*cm. A hybrid ebeam/DUV lithography technique (allowing 50 nm minimum feature size) was used to define the\nnano-resonators and electrode pads, respectively. Top silicon layer was etched by anisotropic reactive\nion etching (RIE). In order to decrease the lead resistances, the interconnecting leads have been made\nthicker with a 650 nm thick AlSi layer, a typical metal for CMOS interconnections process. Finally,\nthe nanoresonators have been released using a vapor HF isotropic etching to remove the sacrificial\nlayer oxide beneath the structures.\n\n3\n\n\f1500 devices per wafer of such design are fabricated with this VLSI process. Functionality of the\nfinal devices is checked measuring both the lead and gauges resistances and resonant frequency. The\nyield is 95% per wafer in average.\nThe NEMS is composed of a fixed-free lever beam and two piezoresistive gauges connected to the\ncantilever at a distance l1=0.15l from its fixed end where l is the beam length (see TAB. 1). This value\nwas chosen to maximize the stress inside the gauges due to the cantilever motion (see FIG. 1). The\ngauges have been etched along the <110> direction in order to benefit from the high gauge factor\nassociated with p++ doped silicon. A drive electrode was patterned along one side of the vibrating\nbeam for electrostatic actuation. The general architecture is given in FIG. 1 and the device dimensions\nare summed up in TAB. 1.\n\nFIG.1 \u2013 Artificially colored and modified SEM image illustrating the in-plane vibration of the beam\n\nBeam\nlength\nl\n\nBeam width\nw\n\n5\u03bcm\n\n300nm\n\nTAB. 1 \u2013 Typical values of the device\nDistance\nGauge\nGauge\nAnchor/Gauges\nlength\nwidth\nl1\nb\nw1\n700nm\n\n500nm\n\n80 nm\n\nElectrode\nlength\na\n\nGap\nElectrode/Beam\ng\n\n3.5 \u03bcm\n\n200nm\n\nThe lead resistance of approximately 4 k\u03a9 and the gauge resistance of 3.6 k\u03a9 were measured using\nthe 3-point local AFM technique [15].\n\n4\n\n\f2.2. Principle of operation\nTo evaluate the dynamical behavior of the NEMS geometry shown in, we used a model based on\nEuler-Bernoulli beam theory that is detailed in Ref [13]. From this model, we can easily compute the\nfirst Eigen frequency, \u03c90, as well as the force Fg acting on the gauges,\n\nFg (\u03c9 ) = \u03b1\n\n\u03c9 02\n\u03c9 02 \u2212 \u03c9 2 + j\u03c9\u03c9 0 / Q\n\nFel (\u03c9 )\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b1, \u03c9, Q and Fel (\u03c9) are the amplification factor, the angular frequency (rad/s), the quality\nfactor, and the electrostatic driving force respectively.\nThe electrostatic driving force along the lever beam is given by Fel = 1 2 C \u2032V 2 , where V the\napplied voltage and C' is the derivative of the capacitance C between the cantilever and the drive\nelectrode with respect to the lateral displacement. At resonance, \u03c9 = \u03c9 0 and the force amplification\nis given by Fg (\u03c9 0 ) Fel (\u03c9 0 ) = j\u03b1Q\n\n(2)\n\nA comparison with the results of Finite Element Modeling (FEM) validated to a large extent our\nanalytical model, as shown in TAB 2.\n\nTAB. 2 \u2013 Comparison of predictions of analytical and FEM models - Meff is the effective mass\nMeff\n\u03c90/2\u03c0\n\u03b1\nAnalytical model\n\n21.10 MHz\n\n6.05\n\n140 fg\n\nFEM model\n\n20.65 MHz\n\n5.2\n\nNA\n\nThe slight discrepancies are due to the assumption that there is no bending moment introduced by\nthe gauges with a perfect anchor.\nThis design results in first order piezoresistive effect (as opposed to weaker second order like in\n[9]) with the suspended gauges acting as collectors of the stress Fg/s, where s is the cross section area\nof the gauges. The strain induced in the gauges is transduced into a resistance variation \u2206R through\nthe piezoresistive effect:\n\nFg (\u03c9 )\n\u2206R(\u03c9 )\n= \u03b3 \u22c5 \u03b5 (\u03c9 ) = \u03b3 \u22c5\nR\n2\u22c5s \u22c5 E\n\n(3)\n\n5\n\n\fwhere \u03b3 and E are the gauge factor and the Young's modulus of the gauges, respectively. The\npiezoresistive factor \u03b3 is usually written as,\n\n\u03b3 = (1 + \u03bd ) +\n\n1 \u2206\u03c1\n\n(4)\n\n\u03b5 \u03c1\n\nwhere \u03c1 , \u03b5 and \u03bd are the resistivity, the strain and the Poisson ratio respectively. The gauge\nfactor, which links the mechanical strain in a gauge to its relative resistance change, is caused by two\neffects. The first is a purely geometric effect and is associated with elastic deformation (first term in\nparenthesis in eqn 4), while the second corresponds to the modification of the energy bands inside the\nsemiconductor, which alters its resistivity (second term in eqn 4). In metals, only the first term is\nsignificant, and the gauge factor ranges from 1 to 4. In semiconductors, the second term is the most\nsignificant contribution. For the chosen <110> crystalline orientation and the doping level of 1019 cm3\n\n, the theoretical value is 47 [16]. In our case, \u03b3 is evaluated to be around 40 from the amplitude peak\n\nat the resonance using equations (1) and (2). This experimental result is in good agreement with the\ntheory. Values of material parameters used in this article are summed up in TAB 3.\n\nParameters\n\nTAB. 3 \u2013 Parameters of the cross-beam NEMS\nE (GPa)\n\u03c5\n\u03bc (g.cm-3)\n\u03c1 (m\u03a9.cm)\n169\n\n0.26\n\n2330\n\n1.4\n\n\u03b3\n40\n\nThe device under test was connected to a radio frequency (RF) circuit board through wire bonding\nand loaded into an RF vacuum chamber for room temperature measurements. At high frequencies, the\nelectrical readout is complicated by parasitic capacitances which change the expected behavior of the\nelectrical circuit. Given the cable capacitance (100pF/m), the input impedance of the Stanford\nResearch 830 lock-in amplifier (R=10M\u03a9, C=25pF), and the device pads, the overall parasitic\ncapacitance at the NEMS output is close to Cp=125pF. This capacitance combines with the electrical\nresistance of the setup to produce a low pass-filter on the output signal with a cut-off frequency of 120\nkHz. To avoid parasitic impedances and cross talk, we used a 2\u03c9 down-mixing technique to read out\nthe resistance variation at a lower frequency \u2206\u03c9 (typically between 10 kHz and 30 kHz) [17]. A\n\n6\n\n\fschematic of the setup is shown in Fig. 2. The cross beam is actuated with a drive voltage Vd at \u03c9/2.\nBecause the electrostatic force is proportional to Vd2 , the strain in the gauges varies at the frequency\n\n\u03c9. This technique results in efficient frequency decoupling of the downmixed signal from parasitic\nfeedthrough. The downmixed signal read out at the middle of the bridge is proportional to,\n\nVout (\u2206\u03c9 ) \u221d \u2206R cos(\u03c9t ) \u22c5 I b cos((\u03c9 + \u2206\u03c9 )t ) =\n\n1\nI b \u22c5 \u2206R \u22c5 cos(\u2206\u03c9t )\n2\n\n(5)\n\nwhere Ib is the bias current through the gauges induced by the bias voltage Vbias (see Fig. 2).\n\nFIG. 2 \u2013 Schematic of the experimental setup used for detecting the resonant motion of the NEMS in\nFig 1. PS, LPF, VCO, X2 are power splitter and phase shifter, voltage control oscillator and frequency\ndoubler respectively.\n\nThe two gauges on each side of the lever arm work under equal and opposite tensile and\ncompressive strains. This balanced bridge configuration suppresses the parasitic feedthrough at the\nmiddle point of the bridge.\n\n3. Experimental results\nThe experiments, performed at room temperature and pressure of less than 1 mTorr, showed a\nremarkably small and flat background, as shown in FIG. 3. The measured quality factor was\n\n7\n\n\fapproximately 5000 in vacuum and 200 at atmospheric pressure. Quality factors up to 10000 were\nmeasured.\n3.1. Signal to background ratio\nThe geometrical and frequency decoupling between the actuation and detection results in a very\nlarge signal to background ratio (SBR) of 67dB. For ultra low mass sensing, SBR is an important\nparameter that should be maximized. At the resonance, a large SBR means large variation of the phase\nfor a small frequency shift (Bode representation). In a closed loop (phase locked loop for instance) the\ndigital error on the readout of the phase will be then low with devices having a large SBR.\nFurthermore device with large background will be more sensitive to the random perturbations of its\nenvironment. This value is close to two orders of magnitude larger than previous SBR [3] [18] [19] at\nambient temperature (300K). Average value per wafer of resonant frequency is 19.16 MHz with a\nmaximum dispersion of 2% showing the pretty good reproducibly of the VLSI process.\nVdrive can be set between a few hundred millivolts to 5 volts before having non linear behavior of the\ncantilever. Vbias can be set up to 10 V before gauge melting. In the experiment, the voltages are set to a\nvalue of 1.5V, which corresponds to the maximum supplied by our AC-generator.\n\nFIG. 3 \u2013 Typical output signal from the structure shown in Fig. 1 in a vacuum with pressure under 1\nmTorr. The signal to background ratio is 67 dB for Vdrive=1.5V and Vbias=1.5V \u2013 Sampling time=30\nms. The inset shows the same data using linear scale.\n\n8\n\n\f3.2. Noise and signal to noise ratio\nFor frequency-shift based sensing applications, frequency fluctuations naturally impose a limit on\nthe sensitivity. One source of frequency fluctuations is due to a finite signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at\nresonance and the resolution can be defined with the approach presented in Ref. [5]. As shown in Fig.\n4, a large SNR of around 100dB can be obtained with our device. This value is larger than data\nreported previously (see [1], [10] for example). To measure the noise, we followed the technique\ndescribed in Ref. [17]. There was no external drive, and only a bias voltage was applied to the gauges.\nThe noise (V / Hz ) was then measured by sweeping the frequency of the bias signal \u03c9bias while\nkeeping a constant offset frequency of \u2206\u03c9 / 2\u03c0 = 25kHz . As a result, the high-frequency thermomechanical noise was mixed down to a lower frequency \u03c9 bias \u2212 \u03c9 0 = \u2206\u03c9 . We thus obtained two\npeaks with amplitudes of 28 nV/\u221aHz, separated by 50kHz (see inset of Fig. 4). The noise level is\nevaluated over a 1 Hz-bandwidth.\nThe noise floor S d1 2 \u2248 13nV / Hz resulted from both the Johnson noise and input noise of\ndetection electronics. The thermomechanical noise S th1 / 2 can be calculated from the peak amplitude\nand the floor level and is approximately 24.8 nV/\u221aHz. The Johnson noise is given by S 1J / 2 =\n\u2248 11.2nV / Hz (R~7600\u03a9). The electronics noise is then SV1 / 2 =\n\n4k B TR\n\nS d \u2212 S J \u2248 6nV / Hz , which\n\nagrees with the noise level specified by the manufacturer of the lock-in amplifier.\n\n9\n\n\fFIG. 4 \u2013 Signal to noise ratio obtained for Vdrive=1.5V and Vbias=1.5V \u2013 Noise is computed for 1Hzbandwith \u2013 The inset corresponds to the noise density peaks around the resonance frequency.\n\nTypically, 1/f-noise created by resistance fluctuations is the main limitation in piezoresistive\nsensors [9]. However, these resistance fluctuations were not observed in our devices at 20-MHz\noperating frequency. In order to investigate the consistency of such a result, we computed 1/f-noise\ndensity using Hooge's empirical relation [20],\n\nSH =\n\n2\nHVbias\nN f \u2212 f bias\n\n(6)\n\nwhere N is the total number of carriers within the gauge and fbias is the bias frequency. The Hooge\nparameter H is extracted from the measurement of the relative resistance variation according to the\nreadout voltage frequency for two amplitudes (see Fig. 5). An AC-bias (~15 kHz) is used to remove\nthe 1/f-noise of the lock-in. By linearly fitting the data, we find H to be approximately 10-6. From Eqn.\n(6), we then estimate the resulting noise to be a few nV/\u221aHz at 20 MHz, which is negligible compared\nto other source of noise. To illustrate this, we included the noise floor level (Johnson and electronics\nnoises) and the thermomechanical noise level in terms of relative resistance fluctuation in Fig. 5. For\nfrequencies higher than 100 kHz 1/f-noise appears to be lower than other noises. This result is in\nparticular obtained thanks to homogenous doping (1019cm-3) in the whole thickness and specific\n\n10\n\n\fannealing. Bad doping process in conjunction with low doping level could lead to opposite\nconclusion.\n\nFIG. 5 \u2013 Contribution of different noise sources expressed in relative resistance change, which is\nindependent of Vbias. 1/f noise density measurement for different bias voltages (colored squares)\ncompared with both the noise floor and the thermomechanical noise. Red curve is the linear fit of the\nexperimental data for 1/f noise. Black curve corresponds to the noise floor (i.e. electronic and Johnson\nnoises). Black dashed curve corresponds to a schematic of the thermomechanical noise.\n\nIt is important to note that we obtain a priori an unexpectedly large SNR (see Fig.4). For our\nsemiconductor nanowire gauges, we infer the piezoresistive gauge factor \u03b3 to be approximately 40,\ncompared to at most a few unities for metallic-layer piezoresistors. The large resistance of the gauges,\nwhich is roughly one or two orders of magnitude (~1k\u03a9) larger than that of metallic-layer\npiezoresistors (~10\u03a9). Taking into account the Johnson noise only, the SNR is given by\n\nSNR J =\n\nVout\nSJ\n\n\u221d\n\n\u03b3Vb \u03b5\n4k bTR\n\n(7)\n\n11\n\n\fwhere T and R are the temperature and the gauge resistance respectively, kb is the Boltzmann constant,\nVb is the RMS value of the bias voltage. Vout is proportional to \u03b4R R according to Eqn. (3). SNR for\nsemiconducting gauge over SNR of metallic gauge can be simply expressed by,\n\nSNR JS\n\u03b3 V\n= S bS\nSNR JM \u03b3 M VbM\n\nRM\nRS\n\n(8)\n\nIndexes S and M are for semiconductor gauge and metallic layer respectively.\nAt constant temperature considering the aforementioned resistances VbS can be 100 times larger\nthan VbM because of the respective fusion temperature of silicon and metals. The SNR J S is then 10\ntimes larger than SNR J M . The gauge factor of silicon nanowires are much higher than the metallic\nlayer gauges used as piezoresistive detection scheme for NEMS. The signal improvement is then\nmuch higher than the noise enhancement and the Johnson noise impact is limited.\n\n3.3. Allan deviation\nUsually NEMS is embedded in a phase locked loop (PLL) or a self-excited loop in order to monitor\ntime evolution of their resonant frequency. The frequency stability of the overall system (e.g. of the\nNEMS and the supporting electronics) is characterized by the Allan deviation, defined as [9]\n\n\u03b4\u03c9 0 \u03c9 0 =\n\n\u2212\n\u2212\nN \uf8eb\n1\n\uf8ec \u03c9 i +1 \u2212 \u03c9 i\n\u2211\n( N \u2212 1) 1 \uf8ec\uf8ec \u03c9 0\n\uf8ed\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n2\n\n(9)\n\n\u2212\n\nwhere \u03c9 i is the average angular frequency in the ith time interval \u03c4 ,N is the number of independent\nfrequency measurements, which is assumed to be a sufficiently large number. The mass resolution\n\n\u03b4m is then\n\n2M eff \u03b4\u03c9 0 \u03c9 0 for 1s-integration time. The theoretical Allan deviation can be expressed\n\nas [6],\n\n(\u03b4\u03c9 0 \u03c9 0 )th = 10 \u2212 DR 20\n\n2Q\n\n(10)\n\nFor the experimental dynamic range, (DR) of 100 dB (see Fig.5) the ultimate Allan deviation would\nbe around 1.5x10-9 over 1s-integration time. For an effective mass of 140 fg (see TAB. 1) and a Q-\n\n12\n\n\ffactor of 5000, this would result in a potential mass resolution of \u03b4m =\n\nM eff\nQ\n\n\u22c5 10 \u2212( DR / 20 ) \u22480.3 zg at\n\nroom temperature and at relatively low frequency (20 MHz).\nThe experimental Allan deviation was measured in open loop recording the phase variation of the\nelectrical signal at the NEMS output. NEMS was driven at its resonant frequency (20MHz). Allan\ndeviation was measured in three steps (for short, intermediate and long times). For low time constants\n(<0.1s), the integration time of the lock-in and the global acquisition time were 100 \u03bcs and 10s\nrespectively. For larger time constants, they were set to 100 \u03bcs and 4000s (50000s) respectively.\nThese adjustments remove the effect of the lock-in filtering that would artificially decrease the Allan\ndeviation and ensure at least 100 points for each interval. We can also note that the smallest interval is\nset by the transient time Q/f (i.e. ~250 \u03bcs in our case). Typical experimental data are shown in FIG 6.\nFor mass sensing the study has to be focused on short times lower than 1s. Typically, we achieved an\nAllan deviation of 10-6 for \u03c4 =1s at room temperature. For long time constant, the minimum Allan\ndeviation reaches 6.10-7. This value is quite a classical one reported in many papers (see [3], [21] for\nexample) and might be considered as the experimental limit.\nThe large difference of three orders of magnitude between the expected value and the experimental\nAllan variance has to do with the fact that actuation is not present during thermomechanical noise\nmeasurement. The DR measurements therefore do not take into account noise contributions from the\nactuation voltage and the thermal bath. Considering both a typical silicon NEMS temperature\ncoefficient of 50 ppm/K and an Allan deviation close to 10-6, the related thermal bath temperature\nfluctuations will be around 10-2 K. The effect of temperature fluctuations on cantilever measurements\nis well explained in Ref [22]. To get better frequency stability we think that the temperature\nfluctuation should be controlled at least below this value. It is also essential to suppress the\nbackground level as much as possible in order to reduce the additional phase noise that results from\nbackground fluctuations associated with electronic and temperature instabilities. The discrepancy\nbetween the Allan deviation obtained with eqn. (10) and the experimental data is an open question\nthat is currently being studied.\n\n13\n\n\fFIG. 6 \u2013 Allan deviation measured in open loop for Vdrive=1.5V and Vbias=1.5V.\n4. Conclusion\nIn this paper, we demonstrate a new kind of detection scheme based on doped silicon nanowire\nstrain gauges that are fully compatible with CMOS processes. This allows very large scale integration\nof devices in a straightforward manner. Measurements obtained with this approach are showing\npromising performances in term of frequency stability, dynamic range, and achievable mass\nresolution. The devices tested in this work were developed as prototypes and were not optimized for\nmass detection at this stage. Such NEMS have thus a great potential for future performance\nimprovements and new applications opportunities. Further device optimization for lower mass and\nhigher frequency, based on advanced top-down nanowire fabrication techniques [23] with expected\ngiant gauge factors will lead to a resolution in the range of few zeptograms or less.\nSeveral papers [3] [7] [10] have argued the importance of reducing the fundamental sources of\nnoise by optimising the NEMS design. However, a tremendous effort is also needed to study and\nunderstand the coupling between NEMS and their environment (temperature fluctuation, packaging),\nwhich apparently limits the resolution so far.\n\n14\n\n\fThis device with the lever arm architecture, symmetric piezoresistive gauges and decoupling\nbetween electrostatic actuation and piezoresistive detection makes the measurements more efficient\nand signal over noise ratio higher. Compared to metallic gauges, doped silicon gauges produce a much\nlarger signal thanks to a much higher intrinsic gauge factor and larger allowed bias voltages (due to\ntheir higher resistance). The signal is thus much easier to detect while noise floor remains very low as\nit is dominated by thermomechanical and electronic, rather than Johnson, noise. Flicker noise (1/f\nnoise), which is often cited as a huge barrier for doped-silicon-based piezoresistive detection, is not an\nissue for RF resonance frequencies.\nVery Large Scale Integration (VLSI) of devices described in this letter will enable a wide range of\nnew devices, such as arrays of massively parallel oscillating NEMS, sensitive multigas sensors, and\nNEMS mass spectrometry with very low frequency dispersion less than 1%.\n\n15\n\n\f4.
