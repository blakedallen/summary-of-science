Here, we present optical observations of an exoplanet candidate, Fomalhaut b. In the plane of the belt, Fomalhaut b lies approximately 119\nastronomical units (AU) from the star and 18 AU from the dust belt, matching\npredictions. We detect counterclockwise orbital motion using Hubble Space\nTelescope observations separated by 1.73 years. Dynamical models of the interaction between the planet and the belt indicate that the planet's mass is at\n1\n\n\fmost three times that of Jupiter for the belt to avoid gravitational disruption.\nThe flux detected at 0.8 \u03bcm is also consistent with that of a planet with mass no\ngreater than a few times that of Jupiter. The brightness at 0.6 \u03bcm and the lack\nof detection at longer wavelengths suggest that the detected flux may include\nstarlight reflected off a circumplanetary disk, with dimension comparable to\nthe orbits of the Galilean satellites. We also observed variability of unknown\norigin at 0.6 \u03bcm.\n\nApproximately 15% of nearby stars are surrounded by smaller bodies that produce copious\namounts of fine dust via collisional erosion (1). These \"dusty debris disks\" are analogues to our\nKuiper Belt, and can be imaged directly through the starlight they reflect or thermal emission\nfrom their dust grains. Debris disks may be gravitationally sculpted by more massive objects;\ntheir structure gives indirect evidence for the existence of accompanying planets (e.g., 2, 3).\nFomalhaut, an A3V star 7.69 pc from the Sun (4), is an excellent example: a planet can explain\nboth the observed 15 AU offset between the star and the geometric center of the belt, and the\nsharp truncation of the belt's inner edge (3, 5\u20137). With an estimated age of 100\u2013300 Myr (8), any\nplanet around Fomalhaut would still be radiating its formation heat, and would be amenable to\ndirect detection. The main observational challenge is that Fomalhaut is one of the brightest stars\nin the sky (mV =1.2 mag); to detect a planet around it requires the use of specialized techniques\nsuch as coronagraphy to artificially eclipse the star and suppress scattered and diffracted light.\nDetection of Fomalhaut b\nCoronagraphic observations with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in 2004 produced the\nfirst optical image of Fomalhaut's dust belt, and detected several faint sources near Fomalhaut\n\n2\n\n\f(6). Fomalhaut's proper motion across the sky is 0.425 arcsecond per year in the southeast\ndirection, which means that objects that are in the background will appear to move northwest\nrelative to the star. To find common proper motion candidate sources, we observed Fomalhaut\nusing the Keck II 10-m telescope in 2005 and with HST in 2006 (SOM). In May, 2008, a\ncomprehensive data analysis revealed that Fomalhaut b is physically associated with the star and\ndisplays orbital motion. Follow-up observations were then conducted at Gemini Observatory at\n3.8 \u03bcm (SOM).\nFomalhaut b was confirmed as a real astrophysical object in six independent HST observations at two optical wavelengths (0.6 \u03bcm and 0.8 \u03bcm; see Fig. 1 and Table S1). It is co-moving\nwith Fomalhaut, except for a 0.184 \u00b1 0.022 arcsecond (1.41 \u00b1 0.17 AU) offset between 2004\nand 2006 (\u2206T = 1.73 yr), corresponding to 0.82 \u00b1 0.10 AU yr\u22121 projected motion relative to\nFomalhaut (SOM). If Fomalhaut b has an orbit that is coplanar and nested within the dust belt,\nthen its semimajor axis is a \u2243 115 AU, close to that predicted by Quillen (7). An object with\na = 115 AU in Keplerian motion around a star with mass 2.0 M\u2299 has an orbital period of 872\nyears, and a circular speed of 3.9 km s\u22121 . The six Keplerian orbital elements are unconstrained\nby measurements at only two epochs; however, by comparing the deprojected space velocity\n\u22121\n(5.5+1.1\n\u22120.7 km s ) with the circular speed we find a lower limit on the eccentricity of 0.13 (95%\n\nconfidence) by assuming that Fomalhaut b is at periastron. Thus, our observations are consistent with bound Keplerian motion, although the exact range of allowable eccentricity depends\nsensitively on poorly known uncertainties in orbital inclination, apsidal orientation, and host\nstellar mass.\nFomalhaut b is located near the faint half of the belt seen in stellar light backscattered by\ndust grains. Therefore it lies behind the sky plane (the Earth-Fomalhaut-Fomalhaut b angle\nis 126o ), at approximately 51o past conjunction as it orbits counter-clockwise. Though faint,\nFomalhaut b is still one hundred times brighter than reflected light from a Jupiter-like planet at\n3\n\n\fthat radius from Fomalhaut (SOM).\nDynamical Models of Planet-Belt Interaction\nWe constrain the mass of Fomalhaut b by modeling its gravitational influence on the dust\nbelt, reproducing properties of the belt inferred from the HST scattered light images. Our\nmodel assumes that Fomalhaut b is solely responsible for the observed belt morphology. This\nassumption implies that the orbits of the belt and of Fomalhaut b are apsidally aligned. The\ndeprojected space velocity of Fom b is nominally inconsistent with this expectation. Apsidal\nmisalignment may imply the existence of additional perturbers; then the mass estimates derived\nfrom our single planet models are upper limits.\nOur modeling procedure takes four steps. First, for a given mass and orbit of Fomalhaut b,\nwe create a population of several thousand parent bodies stable to gravitational perturbations\nfrom the planet. These parent bodies, modeled as test particles, do not undergo close encounters\nwith Fomalhaut b over 100 Myr. Initial parent body orbits have semimajor axes between 120\nand 140 AU, and eccentricities and longitudes of periastron that are purely secularly forced\nby the planet (9). Initial inclinations of parent bodies are randomly and uniformly distributed\nwithin 0.025 radian of Fomalhaut b's orbital plane, and remaining orbital angles are drawn\nat random. After 100 My, parent body orbits differ somewhat from these initial conditions;\nmost survivors have semimajor axes > 130 AU. The forced orbits thus constructed are nested\nellipses of eccentricity \u2248 0.11 that approximate the observed belt morphology. Forced orbits\nare expected to result from interparticle collisions, which dissipate random motions and compel\nplanetesimals to conform towards closed, non-intersecting paths (10).\nThis elliptical annulus of parent bodies is termed a \"birth ring\" (11); erosive collisions\namong parent bodies give birth to smaller sized but more numerous dust grains. The observed\nscattered stellar light arises predominantly not from parent bodies but rather from their dust\n\n4\n\n\fprogeny. Thus the second step of our procedure is to track dust trajectories. We take each parent\nto release a dust grain with the same instantaneous position and velocity as its parent's. The\ntrajectory of a grain of given \u03b2 (force of radiation pressure relative to that of stellar gravity; \u03b2\nscales inversely as grain radius) is then integrated forward under the effects of radiation pressure\nand Poynting-Robertson drag. We carry out integrations for \u03b2 \u2208 (0, 0.00625, 0.0125, . . . , 0.4).\nFor \u03b2 approaching the radiation blow-out value of \u223c1/2, grains execute highly elongated orbits\nwhose periastra are rooted within the birth ring. Integrations last 0.1 Myr, corresponding to the\ncollisional lifetime of grains in Fomalhaut's belt, as estimated from the inferred optical depth\nof the belt.\nThird, we superpose the various \u03b2-integrations to construct maps of optical depth normal\nto the belt plane. To reduce the shot noise associated with a finite number of grains, we smear\neach grain along its orbit: each grain is replaced by an elliptical wire whose linear density along\nany segment is proportional to the time a particle in Keplerian motion spends traversing that\nsegment. We compute the optical depth presented by the collection of wires, weighting each\n\u03b2-integration according to a Dohnanyi (12) grain size distribution. This distribution, which\nreflects a quasi-steady collisional cascade in which parent bodies grind down to grains so small\nthey are expelled by radiation pressure, is assumed to hold in the birth ring, where dust densities\nare greatest and collision rates highest.\nThe final step is to compare the optical depth profile of our dynamical model with that of\na scattered light model adjusted to fit the 2004 HST image of Fomalhaut's belt (6). We focus\non the one belt property that seems most diagnostic of planet mass and orbit: the belt's inner\nedge, having a semimajor axis of ainner = 133 AU according to the scattered light model. This\nedge marks the outer boundary of the planet's chaotic zone (7). The chaotic zone is a swath of\nspace enclosing the planet's orbit which is purged of material because of dynamical instabilities\ncaused by overlapping first-order mean-motion resonances (13). For a given planet mass M,\n5\n\n\fwe adjust the planet's semimajor axis a until the dynamical model's optical depth attains half\nits maximum value at ainner (Fig. 2, bottom panel). Applying this procedure, we find that\nainner \u2212 a = 2.0(M/M\u2217 )2/7 a\n\n(1)\n\nwhere M\u2217 is the central stellar mass.\nTwo trends that emerge from our modeling imply that the mass of the planet should be low.\nFirst, as M increases, the planet more readily perturbs dust grains onto eccentric orbits, and\n>\n\nthe resultant optical depth profile becomes too broad at distances \u223c 140 AU (Fig. 2, bottom\npanel). Second, to not disrupt the belt, larger mass planets must have smaller orbits, violating\nour estimate for the current stellocentric distance of Fomalhaut b (Fig. 2, top two panels). Together, these considerations imply that M < 3MJ . This upper limit supersedes those derived\npreviously (7), as the quantitative details of our model are more realistic [see also (14)]: the\nbelt as a whole is modeled, not just its inner edge; parent bodies are handled separately from\ndust grains, and only the latter are used to compare with observations; stellar radiation pressure\nis accounted for; parent bodies are screened for dynamical stability over the system age; and\ngrain-grain collisions are recognized as destructive, so that dust particle integrations are halted\nafter a collision time.\nModel Planet Atmospheres\nComparison between our photometric data and model planet atmosphere spectra indicate\nthat Fomalhaut b may be a cooling Jovian-mass exoplanet with age 100-300 Myr (Fig. 3). A\nplanet atmosphere model with effective temperature Teff = 400 K and radius 1.2 RJ , for which\nthe bolometric luminosity is 3.4 \u00d7 10\u22127 L\u2299 (15-16), reproduces the observed 0.8 \u03bcm flux.\nThis model implies that the luminosity of Fomalhaut b is lower than any other object observed\noutside the solar system, and thus that it is not a young brown dwarf or a more massive object.\nTheoretical cooling tracks of objects with Teff = 400 K and ages >100 Myr are insensitive to\n6\n\n\funcertain initial conditions (see figure 1 of 15). The luminosity on these tracks is given by\nL \u223c 2 \u00d7 10\u22127 (M/2MJ )1.87 (t/200Myr)\u22121.21 L\u2299 , implying that the mass of Fomalhaut b is 1.7\u2013\n3.5 MJ . The error in the mass is dominated by the age uncertainty.\nRelative to the models of planet atmospheres, the flux of Fomalhaut b is too faint by at least\na factor of a few at 1.6 \u03bcm, and the upper limit set by observations at 3.8 \u03bcm is only marginally\nconsistent with the models. However, the various models disagree with each other by similar\nfactors at 1.6 \u03bcm, partly because of theoretical uncertainties associated with the strengths of the\nCH4 vibrational bands. Moreover, our hypothesized effective temperature is near the condensation temperature of water clouds, and such clouds are a large source of uncertainty in planet\natmosphere models. Nevertheless, our observations at 1.6 \u03bcm and 3.8 \u03bcm exclude a warmer\n(more massive) planet.\nChoosing a 400 K, 46 m s\u22122 , 5\u00d7 solar abundance model from (15) as a baseline, we can\ninvestigate the effects of gravity and composition using theoretical exoplanet model spectra (1516). The elevated abundance set is chosen to be representative of solar system gas giants. The\ntemperature and gravity of this model are a good match to a 200 Myr, 2.5 MJ exoplanet. As\npreviously noted, this model accounts for the 0.8 \u03bcm flux, but over predicts the 1.6 \u03bcm band\nflux by a factor of three. Cooler models (350 K) cannot simultaneously reproduce the 0.8 \u03bcm\nflux without violating the long wavelength flux limits, while for hotter models (500 K) the 1.6\n\u03bcm upper limit becomes particularly problematic. If there is a significant thermal photospheric\ncontribution to the 0.8 \u03bcm flux, then 400 K is a rough upper limit to the temperature of the\nobject.\nThe 400 K, solar abundance model has reduced methane opacity which causes it to be\nunacceptably bright in the H band. The colors and fluxes also depend on the surface gravity.\nModels from (15) for 10 m s\u22122 and 215 m s\u22122 are also available: the colors of the low gravity\nmodel are too red in both [0.8 \u03bcm \u2212 1.6 \u03bcm] and [0.8 \u03bcm \u2212 3.8 \u03bcm] to be acceptable. Thus,\n7\n\n\fif the gravity is lower than our nominal assumption, corresponding to approximately a 0.5 MJ\nobject, then we estimate that the upper limit on temperature is raised by about 50 K. The colors\nof the high-gravity 400 K model are similar to those of the 46 m s\u22122 one.\nOther Sources of Optical Emission\nFrom 0.6 to 0.8 \u03bcm, Fomalhaut b is bluer than the models predict (Fig. 3). Furthermore,\nbetween 2004 and 2006 Fomalhaut b became fainter by \u223c0.5 mag at 0.6 \u03bcm . Photometric variability and excess optical emission cannot be explained by exoplanet thermal radiation alone.\nThe 0.6 \u03bcm flux might be contaminated by H\u03b1 emission (SOM) that is detected from brown\ndwarfs (17, 18). Variable H\u03b1 emission might arise from a hot planetary chromosphere heated\nby vigorous internal convection, or trace hot gas at the inner boundary of a circumplanetary\naccretion disk, by analogy with magnetospheric emission from accreting T Tauri stars (e.g.,\n19). If a circumplanetary disk is extended, the starlight it reflects might contribute to the flux\ndetected at 0.6 and 0.8 \u03bcm. To explain our observed fluxes requires a disk radius \u223c 20 \u2212 40 RJ ,\ncomparable to the orbital radii of Jupiter's Galilean satellites (SOM). The need for additional\nsources of luminosity implies that the mass inferred from the 0.8 \u03bcm flux alone is an upper\nlimit.\nAs remarkably distant as Fomalhaut b is from its star, the planet might have formed in situ.\nThe dust belt of Fomalhaut contains three Earth masses of solids in its largest collisional parent bodies. Adding enough gas to bring this material to cosmic composition would imply a\nminimum primordial disk mass of 1 MJ , comparable to the upper mass limit of Fomalhaut b.\nAlternatively, the planet might have migrated outward by interacting with its parent disk (20), or\nby gravitationally scattering off another planet in the system and having its eccentricity mildly\ndamped by dynamical friction with surrounding disk material (21).\n\n8\n\n\fReferences and Notes\n1.

After a correction for\ngeometric distortion the pixel size is 25\u00d725 mas. In 2004 we placed Fomalhaut behind the 1.8\u2032\u2032\nocculting spot only, whereas in 2006 we imaged Fomalhaut behind both occulting spots (Table\nS1). Even though the occulting spots block the core of the stellar point spread function (PSF),\na significant halo of light is present in the entire CCD frame. We use two separate strategies to\nremove this PSF halo: 1) We observe another bright star (Vega) with the coronagraph and use\nthis template PSF to subtract the PSF of Fomalhaut, and (2) We image Fomalhaut such that the\ndetector is rotated at different angles relative to the sky. In the instrument reference frame the\nPSF is quasi-static, whereas astrophysical features rotate. The 2006 data acquire Fomalhaut at\nfour separate position angles (PA) of the sky on the detector, with a maximum PA separation\nof 6o . Taking the median value of these frames gives a master PSF that does not contain the\nastrophysical features. The master PSF is then subtracted from the individual images, which\nare then rotated to a common orientation and combined. Technique 2 is known in the literature\nas roll deconvolution or angular difference imaging (ADI; S2-S4).\nTable S1 catalogs our observations. Fomalhaut b is detected independently in each row with\nan F606W and F814W observations. For each of these rows, Fomalhaut b is detected using\nboth PSF subtraction techniques outlined above. False-positives are defined as apparent point\nsources that cannot be consistently confirmed among these data sets.\n\n11\n\n\fTable S1: Fomalhaut Observing log\nObservatory\nInstrument\nUT Date\nFilter\n\u2032\u2032\nHST 2.4-m\nACS/HRC 1.8 spot 2004 Oct. 25\nF606W\n................. 1.8\u2032\u2032 spot 2004 Oct. 26\nF606W\n................. 1.8\u2032\u2032 spot 2006 July 14\nF435W\n................. 3.0\u2032\u2032 spot 2006 July 15-16 F435W\n................. 1.8\u2032\u2032 spot 2006 July 17-19 F606W\n................. 3.0\u2032\u2032 spot 2006 July 19-20 F606W\n................. 1.8\u2032\u2032 spot 2006 July 18\nF814W\n\u2032\u2032\n................. 3.0 spot 2006 July 19\nF814W\n\u2032\u2032\nKeck II 10-m NIRC2 2.0 spot\n2005 July 17\nH\n2005 July 27\nH\n2005 July 28\nH\n2005 Oct. 21\nH\n2005 Oct. 22\nCH4\nGemini N 8-m NIRI\n2008 Sep. 17-18 L\u2032\n\nExp.

We\nused a camera scale of 0.04\u2032\u2032 per pixel and a 2.0\u2032\u2032 diameter, semi-transparent occulting spot.\nThough the instrument has reimaging optics to fix the sky angle relative to the detector reference frame, we permit the sky to rotate in order to employ PSF subtraction technique 2 (ADI).\nGemini South observations at L\u2032 , without adaptive optics correction, were executed in a similar\nmanner to employ the ADI technique. We used the NIRI F/32 camera with 22 mas pixels, giving a 22.4\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 22.4\u2032\u2032 field of view. Fomalhaut b is not detected in either the Keck II or Gemini\nNorth data.\n\nAstrometry\nThe astrometric reference frame is established relative to the star Fomalhaut as there are\nno other adequately bright stars contained within the ACS/HRC field of view. The significant source of astrometric uncertainty is determining the position of Fomalhaut behind the\nACS/HRC occulting spots. Successive frames may be registered at the sub-pixel level relative\n12\n\n\fto each other by mutual subtraction, but a fiducial frame is required where the pixel position of\nFomalhaut behind the occulting spot is estimated. This is achieved by minimizing the residuals\nwhen a frame is subtracted from a copy of itself rotated by 180o . The residuals are minimized\nwhen the assumed center of rotation is nearest the position of the star behind the spot. The\nself-subtraction center positions can be compared to the relative center positions determined by\nsubtracting images of Fomalhaut obtained in successive orbits. We thus estimate the accuracy\nof determining the location of Fomalhaut behind the occulting spots using 180o self-subtraction\ntechnique as \u00b10.5 pixel (12.5 mas, or 0.10 AU at the distance to Fomalhaut). This value is an\nupper limit to the possible difference between the true and estimated positions of Fomalhaut.\nThe centroid position of Fomalhaut b were measured in three versions of the final F606W\nprocessed images in 2004, and seven versions from the 2006 F606W processed data. All images\nwere rotated to the orientation shown in Fig. 1. We find a standard error of 0.31 and 0.55 pixel\nalong the x and y directions in the 2004 data. In the 2006 measurements the corresponding\nstandard errors are 0.09 and 0.32 pixel. Adding these uncertainties in quadrature to the uncertainties in the position of Fomalhaut at each epoch gives 0.87 pixel for the 1-\u03c3 uncertainty in the\nestimated motion of Fomalhaut b between epochs. This translates to 0.022 arcsecond or 0.169\nAU.\nThe fact that Fomalhaut b is orbiting Fomalhaut is robust because the apparent orbital motion of 7.3 pixels between epochs is significantly greater than these uncertainties, as well as the\nPSF full-width at half-maximum of \u223c2.7 pixels. Fomalhaut b cannot be a background objects\nas shown in Fig. S1. The empirical RMS accuracy in the position angle achieved in ACS data is\n0.003 degrees (S5), which corresponds to an insignificant uncertainty of 0.03 pixel at the radial\nposition of Fomalhaut b.\n\nPhotometry\n13\n\n\fIn the cases where Fomalhaut b was detected (HST), we report photometry corrected to an\ninfinite aperture using DAOPHOT and an empirical curve of growth derived from the data (Table\nS2). Zeropoints for the HST data are obtained from (S6). The error bars quoted are statistical\nonly. The standard error derived from multiple versions of the F606W data with different PSF\nsubtraction techniques is 0.10 mag and 0.05 mag for the 2004 and 2006 data, respectively.\nTable S2: Photometry on Fomalhaut b\nUT Date\nFilter\n\u03bbc (\u03bcm) Magnitude\n2004-10-25\nF606W 0.606\n24.43\n2004-10-26\n...\n...\n24.29\n2005-07-21\nH\n1.633\n>22.9\n2005-10-21\nCH4 S\n1.592\n>20.6\n2006-07-14/20 F606W 0.606\n25.13\n...\nF814W 0.814\n24.55\n...\nF435W 0.435\n>24.7\n2008-09-17/18 L\u2032\n3.78\n>16.6\n\nError (mag)\n0.08\n0.09\n3\u03c3 limit\n3\u03c3 limit\n0.09\n0.13\n3\u03c3 limit\n3\u03c3 limit\n\nDetection?\nYes\nYes\nNo\nNo\nYes\nYes\nNo\nNo\n\nPhotometric calibration of the Keck upper limits is a multi-step process. Data were scaled\nto a common signal level using background star observations prior to combination. For the\nmulti-night combination of H-band data, we use the July 17 observations for photometric calibration because of that night's exceptional conditions. The peak brightness of Fomalhaut was\nmeasured through the partially transmissive occulting spot in short exposure images. These\nmeasurements were used to determine an on-axis sensitivity calibration using the 2MASS photometry of Fomalhaut and the previously measured occulting spot transmission. We derived a\nsensitivity curve by measuring the standard deviation of fluxes in apertures of 3 pixel diameter\nand measured the value at the predicted angular separation of Fomalhaut b. Finally, we noted\nthat the Strehl ratio at the location of Fomalhaut b is degraded due to anisoplanatism. We estimated a decrease in sensitivity of 0.75 mag, which corresponds to an isoplanatic angle of 13\u2032\u2032 at\n1.6 \u03bcm.\n\n14\n\n\fCalibration of the Gemini L\u2032 -band data was performed using observations of a standard star,\nHR 9016A, which were obtained in the middle of the observing sequence each night. The unsaturated exposures of the standard were used to derive a photometric zero point and aperture\ncorrection for each night. The data from the different nights were scaled to the same throughput\nin apertures of 0.3\u2032\u2032 diameter prior to combination. The upper limit to Fomalhaut b was obtained\nby measuring the standard deviation of flux in 0.3\u2032\u2032 apertures in an arc along \u00b145 degrees of\nthe predicted position of Fomalhaut b. We adopt a factor of 2 in decreased sensitivity due to the\nestimated Strehl degradation from errors in centroiding the saturated images of Fomalhaut.\n\nBolometric luminosity\nIn this section and following, we consider various possibilities for the origin of the detected\noptical flux. Here, we assume that the F814W flux is pure thermal emission from the planet,\nwhich consistent with the model atmosphere from (S7) where Tef f = 400 K; g = 46 m s\u22122 ;\nand 5\u00d7 solar metallicity. With this effective temperature, and with a planet radius 1.2 RJ , the\nbolometric flux at Earth is:\nrp\nF =\ndp\n\u0012\n\n\u00132\n\n4\n\u221213\n\u03c3SB Tef\nerg s\u22121 cm\u22122\nf = 1.86 \u00d7 10\n\n(2)\n\nwhere rp is the the radius of Fomalhaut b, dp is the heliocentric distance, and \u03c3SB is the StefanBoltzmann constant. As a check, we integrate the flux from the (S7) high resolution model\nspectrum, and obtain:\n7.5\u00d710\nZ 14 Hz\n\nF\u03bd d\u03bd = 1.80 \u00d7 10\u221213 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122\n\n(3)\n\n6.0\u00d71012 Hz\n\nThe smaller value is expected because the model is tabulated over a finite frequency range and\nsome power is missing in the numerical integration. The corresponding luminosity is \u223c 3\u00d710\u22127\nL\u2299 , which indicates that Fomalhaut b is the faintest known object outside of the solar system.\n\n15\n\n\fH\u03b1 Emission\nPhotometry in the F606W filter varies between 25.1 and 24.3 mag (0.36 and 0.75 \u03bcJy, respectively). Assuming that the flux is due to a single, narrow emission line, the equivalent line\nflux would be \u2206\u03bdF\u03bd = 0.7 \u2212 1.5 \u00d7 10\u221214 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 . The fractional luminosity would be\nLH\u03b1 /Lbol = 0.4\u22120.8%. The H\u03b1 emission from Fomalhaut b would be similar to that suggested\nfor GQ Lup b, where LH\u03b1 /Lbol = 2% (S8).\nThe H\u03b1 emission hypothesis can be tested with an optical spectrum of Fomalhaut b. If confirmed, then a key problem is explaining the origin of gas around a 200 Myr yr old star (two\norders of magnitude older than GQ Lub b). Equating the H\u03b1 luminosity to accretion luminosity,\nthe accretion rate is 10\u221211 MJ yr\u22121 , or 0.002 MJ over the age of the system (assuming 100%\nefficiency). If we assume that the efficiency is \u223c1%, then the total gas accretion is 0.2 MJ .\n\nDust Cloud Model\nWe explore the possibility that Fomalhaut b represents reflected light from an unresolved\ndust cloud that is not gravitationally bound and therefore not associated with a planet. In this\nscenario the cloud arises from the stochastic, catastrophic collision of two parent bodies analogous to Kuiper Belt Objects or short-period comets in the solar system. The event is improbable at the location of Fomalhaut b compared to regions closer to the star where the collision\ntimescales are significantly shorter, or farther from the star where the number density of parent\nbodies is enhanced in order to replenish the visible belt with fresh dust.\nSince Fomalhaut b appears as a point source in the HST data, the maximum size of the dust\ncloud corresponds to the full-width at half-maximum of the PSF, which is 69\u00b16 mas or 0.53\n\u00b10.05 AU (compared against the background star shown in Fig. S1, which has FWHM = 68 \u00b1 4\nmas). A dust cloud could originate from a catastrophic collision between two planetesimals, but\nthe event must be recent because even in the absence of stellar radiation pressure and Poynting16\n\n\fRobertson drag, the different orbital period of a dust grain located at the inner boundary of the\ncloud (i.e. closest to Fomalhaut) versus the outer boundary of the cloud would shear the cloud\ninto an arc, ultimately becoming a ring of material orbiting Fomalhaut.\nThe dust cloud will contain a size distribution of grains, though the scattered light images\nare predominantly sensitive to grain sizes with x = 2\u03c0a/\u03bb \u223c 1, where a is the grain radius. In\nour model of a dust cloud we assume a size distribution with amin < a < amax following a differential size distribution dn/da = no (a/ao )\u22123.5 . We note that due to radiation pressure from\nFomalhaut, grains smaller than 3\u22128 \u03bcm (depending on porosity) are ejected from the system\non free-fall timescales (S9). We therefore use Mie theory to calculate the apparent magnitude\nand scattered light color of a dust cloud with amin = 0.01 \u03bcm and amax = 1000 \u03bcm (m0.01 in\nTable S3) and amin = 8 \u03bcm and amax = 1000 \u03bcm (m8 in Table S3). These values represent two\nextremes of a fresh dust cloud with small grains still present within the cloud, and a later epoch\nwhere only grains larger than the radiation pressure blowout size of \u223c8 \u03bcm have survived. We\ntest grains composed of water ice (density = 1.0 g cm\u22123 ; mice in Table S3) and refractory carbonaceous material (density = 2.2 g cm\u22123 ; S10; mLG in Table S3). The results for these two\ncalculations are given in Table S3. The total grain mass (and hence the total scattering surface\narea) is adjusted such that the integrated light in F814W from the model matches the observations. In the case of m8ice , the total mass is 1.24\u00d71021 g, which corresponds to the disruption of\na 67 km water ice body. However, the total grain mass depends strongly on the value selected\nfor amax . Perhaps a more useful calculation is the minimum grain mass assuming the grain size\ndistribution is nearly monodisperse and peaks where the scattering efficiency is highest. For\nthese optical observations, the scattering efficiency is highest for grains 0.1 \u2212 0.2 \u03bcm in size,\ngiving a minimum dust mass in the cloud Md = 4.1 \u00d7 1018 (\u03c1g /1.0 g cm\u22123 ) g. Therefore, for\nwater ice, the minimum grain mass is 4.1 \u00d7 1018 g, corresponding to the disruption of a 10 km\nradius object.\n17\n\n\fTable S3: Dust cloud model for Fomalhaut b\nFilter\nm\u22c6\nmFom\u2212b\nm0.01\nm0.01\nm8ice\nice\nLG\nF435W 1.25 >24.7 3-\u03c3\n24.37 24.59 24.50\nF606W 1.16 25.13 \u00b1 0.09 24.46 24.57 24.67\nF814W 1.08 24.55 \u00b1 0.13 24.55 24.55 24.55\nTable S4:\nFilter\n\u2206m\u22c6\nF435W - F606W 0.09\nF606W - F814W 0.08\n\nm8LG\n24.83\n24.68\n24.55\n\nColors of the dust cloud model\n0.01\n\u2206mFom\u2212b \u2206m0.01\n\u2206mLG\n\u2206m8ice\nice\n<0.43\n-0.09\n0.02\n-0.17\n0.58\n-0.09\n0.02\n0.12\n\n\u2206m8LG\n0.15\n0.13\n\nIn Table S4 we give the apparent optical colors. The dust cloud model explains the Fomalhaut b observations with respect to the non-detections in H and L\u2032 . Otherwise, the dust cloud\nmodel is inconsistent with the Fomalhaut b photometry because: (1) A dust cloud should have\nbeen detected in the F435W data (except in the case of m8LG in Table S4), and (2) The color of a\ndust cloud is significantly bluer than the observed red color of Fomalhaut b (Table S3). A third\nsignificant problem with the dust cloud model is explaining the F606W variability observed\nover two epochs. The cumulative scattering surface area would have to drop by 63% over 1.73\nyear to account for the 0.5 mag decrease in optical magnitude. One possible mechanism is that\nthe 2004 data show Fomalhaut b with a small grain component, but in 2006 the small grains\nhave dispersed due to radiation pressure. Removing all grains < 8 \u03bcm in size from the first\nmodel without renormalizing the F814W flux results in a brightness decrease of 2.23 mag in\nF606W. Thus an 0.5 mag decrease is possible by tuning the removal of small grains over 1.73\nyears. This scenario demands that we have observed the cloud at a fortuitous time right after it\nhas been produced, but before all of the small grains are blown out.\nTaking all four arguments together \u2013 the low probability of the stochastic collision at the\nposition of Fomalhaut b, the fortuitous timing to explain variability, the non detection in the\nF435W filter, and the somewhat discrepant observed optical colors compared to a model \u2013 the\n18\n\n\fdust cloud hypothesis appears inadequate to explain the observed properties of Fomalhaut b.\n\nReflected light from a planet surrounded by an extended dust disk\nWe consider the hypothesis that the Fomalhaut b observations are explained by reflected\nlight from a Jovian planet surrounded by a large ring system. First, we consider reflected light\nfrom the planet alone. The flux received at Earth from the star (Fomalhaut) is:\n6.34 \u00d7 1027\nL\u22c6\n=\n= 8.914 \u00d7 10\u22129 Wm\u22122\nf\u22c6 =\n2\n17\n2\n4\u03c0 D\n4\u03c0 (2.379 \u00d7 10 )\n\n(4)\n\nwhere L\u22c6 is the stellar luminosity in watts (W; S12), and D is the heliocentric distance (7.688\npc = 2.379 \u00d7 1017 m).

If we ignore the reduction in brightness due to viewing phase, the\n19\n\n\fgeometric cross section of a 1.2 RJ planet is \u03c3p = \u03c0 \u00d7 (1.2 \u00d7 7.15 \u00d7 107 m)2 = 2.31 \u00d7 1016\nm2 . For Qs = 0.5, the apparent magnitude of this planet mp = 30.0 mag. Thus, the observed\napparent magnitude of Fomalhaut b at optical wavelengths (Table S2) is \u223c5 mag brighter than\nlight reflected from a Jupiter.\nNow we consider that the planet is surrounded by dust grains analogous to circumplanetary\nrings. Since this is a flattened disk, the geometric cross section scales as cos(i), where i is\nthe inclination to the line of sight (i = 0o is a face-on orientation). Consider that the main,\noptically thick rings of Saturn extend out to Saturn's Roche radius, or about 2 planetary radii.\nIf Fomalhaut b also harbored a ring system extending to its Roche radius, then \u03c3p would be\nreplaced by the ring cross section \u03c3pr \u223c \u03c3p \u00d7 22 \u00d7 cos(66o ) \u223c 1.6\u03c3p . Assuming again Qs =\n0.5, the apparent magnitude of the system would be mpr = 29.5 mag, or about 4.5 mag too faint\ncompared to what is actually observed.\nTo make up for this shortcoming, the scattering surface area of the planet+ring system would\nhave to increase by yet another factor of \u223c60. This would correspond to about \u223c16 planetary\nradii. If the effective albedo of the ring particles is closer to 0.1-and in fact outer solar system\nalbedoes are typically this low-then the rings must extend to \u223c35 planetary radii. An optically thick ring system that is 16\u201335 planetary radii large is better described as a protosatellite,\ncircumplanetary disk. For example, the outermost Galilean satellite of Jupiter, Callisto, has a\nplanetocentric distance of about \u223c27 Jupiter radii. Regular satellites have prograde motion that\nindicates formation in situ around the planet.\nThough in some respects this is similar to the pure dust cloud model, the planet+disk hypothesis has several advantages: (1) The presence of a planet allows for a wider range of physical\nphenomena to account for the F606W variability, such as the H\u03b1 hypothesis. (2) The location\nof Fomalhaut b just inside the dust belt is consistent with the predicted location of a planet\ngravitationally sculpting the belt's inner edge. (3) The existence of a planet permits a system of\n20\n\n\fdust to be spatially confined rather than dispersed due to shearing or radiation pressure.\n\nSOM References\n1. H. C.

All the other apparent objects in the field are either background stars and galaxies or\nfalse-positives. The fainter lower half of the dust belt lies behind the sky plane. To obtain an\norientation with north up and east left, this figure should be rotated 66.0o counterclockwise. The\nyellow circle marks the location of the star behind the occulting spot. The yellow ellipse has a\nsemimajor axis of 30 AU at Fomalhaut (3.9\u2032\u2032 ) that corresponds to the orbit of Neptune in our\nsolar system. The inset is a composite image showing the location of Fomalhaut b in 2004 and\n2006 relative to Fomalhaut. Bounding Fomalhaut b are two elliptical annuli that are identical\nto those shown for Fomalhaut's dust belt (6), except that here the inner and outer annuli have\nsemimajor axes of 114.2 and 115.9 AU, respectively. The motion of Fomalhaut b therefore\nappears to be nested within the dust belt.\n\n22\n\n\fRelative vertical\noptical depth of dust\n\nNumber of stable parent bodies\n\n1000\n\n100\n\n10\n\nEstimated\ndeprojected\nstellocentric\ndistance\nof Fom b\nin 2006\n\n5:3\n7:4\n\n10 MJ\na = 94 AU\ne = 0.14\n\n1000\n\n4:3\n7:5\n100\n\nPlanetary\nchaotic\n\n1 MJ\na = 109 AU\ne = 0.12\n\nzone\n10\n\n1.0\n\nKalas et al. 05 model\n0.1 MJ, a = 120 AU\n0.3 MJ, a = 115.5 AU\n1 MJ, a = 109 AU\n3 MJ, a = 101.5 AU\n10 MJ, a = 94 AU\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n100\n\n120\n140\n160\nSemimajor axis a (AU)\n\n180\n\nFigure 2: Dynamical models of how Fomalhaut b gravitationally sculpts the belt [see also (14)].\nTop two panels: Histograms of time-averaged semimajor axes of parent bodies that survive 100Myr-long integrations with Fomalhaut b, whose parameters are chosen to reproduce the belt's\ninner edge at 133 AU and ellipticity of 0.11. Parent bodies are evacuated from Fomalhaut b's\nchaotic zone (yellow region). Gaps open at the planet's resonances, akin to the solar system's\nKirkwood gaps. Black circles and bars mark the range of stellocentric distances spanned by the\nmodel orbits for Fomalhaut b. The apocentric distance for 10 MJ is inconsistent with the observed stellocentric distance of Fomalhaut b (green line). The 1 MJ model is consistent. Bottom\npanel: Vertical optical depth profiles of dust generated from parent bodies. The planet orbit is\ntuned so that the optical depth is at half maximum at 133 AU, the location of the inner edge of\nthe scattered light model from (6) (red curve), which itself is an idealized and non-unique fit\nto the HST data. While the dynamical and scattered light models do not agree perfectly, lower\n>\nplanet masses are still inferred because they do not produce broad tails of emission at a \u223c 140\n>\nAU. At a \u223c 160 AU, the HST data are too uncertain to constrain any model.\n\n23\n\n\fFigure 3: Photometry on Fomalhaut b shows the F435W 3-\u03c3 upper limit (yellow square), two\nF606W measurements (blue square=2006, blue circle=2004), the F814W photometry (green\nsquare), 3-\u03c3 upper limits for Keck observations in the CH4 passband (purple solid star) and the\nH band (red solid star), and a 3-\u03c3 upper limits for Gemini observations at L\u2032 (light blue star).\nThis is a log-log plot. If we first assume that the F606W variability is due to H\u03b1 emission and the\nF814W detection is due to planet thermal emission, we then proceed to fit a planet atmosphere\nmodel from (15) to the F814W flux. The heavy solid line represents that planet atmosphere\nmodel smoothed to R=1200 with planet radius 1.2 RJ , gravity 46 m s\u22122 , and T=400K (roughly\n1-3 MJ at 200 Myr). The horizontal colored lines mark the equivalent broad-band flux found by\nintegrating the model spectrum over the instrumental passband. Other models from (16) give\na similar spectrum (light solid line), though a factor of 3 - 4 brighter in CH4 and H band. The\nmodel predicts that the planet candidate should have been detected with Keck in the H band,\nthough this prediction is only a factor of a few above our limit. The discrepancy could arise\nfrom uncertainties in the model atmosphere (which has never been tested against observation),\nor from the possibility that the F606W and F814W detections include stellar light reflected\nfrom a circumplanetary dust disk or ring system. The solid blue line intersecting the optical\ndata represents light reflected from a circumplanetary disk with radius 20 RJ , a constant albedo\nof 0.4, and with stellar properties adopted from (22).\n24\n\n\fFigure 4: Fig. S1: Two enlarged sub-regions (at the same scale) from Figure 1 centered on\nFomalhaut b and a background star (located at the 8 o'clock position relative to Fomalhaut\nin Fig. 1, just outside the dust belt). We show relative motion by registering the 2004 and\n2006 data to Fomalhaut and producing the difference image. Background objects are easily\ndistinguished from the planet candidate in terms of the magnitude (0.7 arcsecond) and direction\nof their motion. In 2004, Fomalhaut b is detected at separation \u03c1 = 12.61\u2032\u2032 and position angle,\nPA = 316.86o relative to Fomalhaut. In 2006, Fomalhaut b is at \u03c1 = 12.72\u2032\u2032 and position angle,\nPA = 317.49o (recall that the orientation shown here is rotated 66.0o clockwise from one that\ngives north up and east left).\n\n25\n\n\f"}
