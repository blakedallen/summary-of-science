Box MG6, Bucharest, Romania\nemail: dita@zeus.theory.nipne.ro\nNovember 3, 2018\n\nAbstract\nIn this paper we obtain a description of the Hermitian operators\nacting on the Hilbert space Cn , description which gives a complete\nsolution to the over parameterization problem. More precisely we provide an explicit parameterization of arbitrary n-dimensional operators,\noperators that may be considered either as Hamiltonians, or density\nmatrices for finite-level quantum systems. It is shown that the spectral multiplicities are encoded in a flag unitary matrix obtained as an\nordered product of special unitary matrices, each one generated by\na complex n \u2212 k-dimensional unit vector, k = 0, 1, . . . , n \u2212 2. As a\nbyproduct, an alternative and simple parameterization of Stiefel and\nGrassmann manifolds is obtained.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThere is a considerable interest in a simple description of density matrices\nthat have a wide variety of applications, particularly in quantum information\ntheory, and many efforts were devoted in describing them. However the problem of over parameterization is still open [17], for an arbitrary n. We solve\nthis problem by providing an explicit parameterization of eigenvalues, as\nwell as of the unitary matrices that diagonalize arbitrary finite-dimensional\nHermitian operators. Quite expectedly, such a description is closely related\nto the description of various homogeneous manifolds, alluded to the title.On\nthe other hand the Stiefel, or Grassmann manifolds arise in many problems\n1\n\n\ffrom different other domains such as encryption, coherent states, geometric\nphases, signal processing, geometric integration on homogeneous manifolds,\nnumerical linear algebra algorithms, and many others. In such problems,\nthe \"states of interest\" are, in general, elements of some homogeneous space\nX\u223c\n= G/K\n\n(1.1)\n\nwhere G is a Lie group, and K is a closed subgroup of G. Further in problems\narising in engineering, physics, quantum information theory, one needs a\nconcrete realization of these manifolds in a form able to be stored into a\ncomputer. Although, the geometrical description of Grassmann and Stiefel\nmanifolds is available in many books, see for example [5], [7], the available\nparameterizations of the above manifolds are not the most convenient in\nsome concrete applications, e.g. [3], [16] .\nOne aim of the paper is to obtain a satisfactory description of Hermitian\noperators that appear in the study of finite-level systems. By satisfactory, we\nmean a complete as possible description of equivalence classes of Hermitian\noperators, i.e. a full and complete parameterization of the orbits generated by these operators. We recall that two Hermitian operators are in the\nsame orbit if their spectra coincide, or, equivalently, if their characteristic\npolynomials are identical. Our own interest in studying such problems was\noriginally awakened by a query raised by a colleague of mine [11] who is interested in a complete description of the solutions of the quadratic operator\nequation\n\u03c12 \u2212 2p \u03c1 + (p2 \u2212 q 2 ) In = 0,\n\np, q \u2208 R, with p2 \u2212 q 2 \u2265 0\n\n(1.2)\n\nwhere, in the following, In denotes the unit n-dimensional matrix, and \u03c1 is\na Hermitian operator. When \u03c1 is a density matrix, the equation (1.2) is the\nsimplest generalization of the pure state condition \u03c12 = \u03c1. We note that\nWerner states [14], and Horodecki states [6] satisfy such an equation.\nBy itself, an equation as (1.2) has nothing special. According to CayleyHamilton theorem, any finite n-dimensional matrix satisfies an n-degree\npolynomial equation, the characteristic polynomial. As we will see in the\nfollowing, equation (1.2) describes a Hermitian operator whose spectrum\nhas a maximum degeneracy. If the multiplicities of eigenvalues are denoted\nby k and n \u2212 k, respectively, the spectral decomposition of \u03c1 is\n\u03c1 = \u03bb1 P + \u03bb2 (In \u2212 P )\n\n(1.3)\n\nwhere P is the projection onto the k-dimensional subspace. Thus, a description of the projection P on Cn is equivalent to a description of the\nGrassmann manifold Gr(k, n).\n2\n\n\fFormally, the states of an n-level quantum system are described by density matrices \u03c1 that are positive, Hermitian, nuclear operators whose trace\nis normalized to unity\n\u03c1 = {\u03c1 \u2265 0, \u03c1 = \u03c1\u2217 , T r \u03c1 = 1}\n\n(1.4)\n\nwhere \u2217 denotes adjoint, i.e. the complex conjugated transpose.\nIf we denote by D = (\u03bb1 , . . . \u03bbn ) the diagonal matrix of \u03c1 eigenvalues,\nelementary facts from the spectral theory of self-adjoint operators tell us that\nthere exists a unitary operator U \u2208 U (n), where U (n) \u2208 End Cn , generated\nby the eigenvectors of \u03c1 such that\n\u03c1 = U D U\u2217\n\n(1.5)\n\nP\nwith n1 \u03bbi = 1. In the generic case, a Hermitian n \u00d7 n matrix H is parameterized by n2 real parameters, number which coincides with the number\nof parameters entering the parameterization of an arbitrary unitary matrix\nU \u2208 U (n). Since the eigenvalues \u03bbi are also independent, we infer from (1.5)\nthat there are some constraints upon the form of U , i.e. the number of free\nparameters entering U is less than n2 . It is well known that the constraints\ncoming from the Hermitian character of an operator H may be translated\nto the request that its eigenvectors are defined up to an overall arbitrary\nphase. We choose the phases such that the first entry of each eigenvector is\na non-negative number. This means that the first row entries of U are nonnegative, i.e. U is parameterized by n(n \u2212 1) real parameters, and in this\nway we conclude that a generic Hermitian matrix is parameterized by n2 real\nparameters, as it should be. In fact this approach will be used everywhere\nin the paper: we start with a parameterization of U (n) and restrict to the\nappropriate subset of coordinates to describe the corresponding manifold.\nWe made this digression because, especially in the physical literature,\nU , entering equation (1.5), is considered an element of SU (n \u2212 1), that\nevidently leads to an over parameterization. Thus when we have to do some\nsymbolical, or even numerical calculations, as in [17] or [12], we have to be\nmore careful. We shall see later that such a U is a matrix realization of the\nflag manifold\nX\u223c\n= U (n)/U (1)n\n\n(1.6)\n\nwhere U (1)n denotes the torus subgroup of U (n). By obtaining a full and\nexplicit parameterization of X, we obtain, via formula (1.5), a parameterization of all finite-dimensional Hermitian operators whose spectra are simple.\n3\n\n\fSuch a construction addresses an old fundamental question in the theory\nof measurement [15],[8], namely if it is possible to measure experimentally\nthe 'variables' corresponding to an arbitrary Hermitian operator. Thus the\nfirst question to be solved is the finding of the 'variables' entering an Hermitian operator. After that, the answer is simple: there does exist an experimental embodiment for every Hermitian operator in finite-dimensional\nHilbert space; see [10] for details concerning its realization.\nIf \u03c1 is a density matrix, then \u03c1 in equation (1.5) is parameterized by n2 \u22121\nparameters because of the trace condition. At the other extreme, there is\nthe case when H is an one-dimensional projection, and then U entering (1.5)\nis a matrix realization of the coset\nX\u223c\n=\n\nU (n)\n\u223c\n= Gr(1, n) \u223c\n= CP n\u22121\nU (1) \u00d7 U (n \u2212 1)\n\nwhere G(1, n) denotes the simplest Grassmannian. Between these two extreme cases lie all the other spectral types. For example, the solutions of\nequation (1.2) describe the most degenerate spectrum, which means that \u03c1\nhas only two distinct non-zero eigenvalues. By description, we will understand the parameterization of the set of all unitary diagonalizing operators\nU in terms of a subset of parameters entering the parameterization of the\ngroup U (n), for a generic situation. In other words we are looking for a\nmatrix realization of the relation (1.3), i.e. of the projection P , and this\nis the place where the Grassmann manifolds enter the play; and we expect\nthat in this case, stronger conditions on the form of U will be in force. In\nfact, in this paper, we provide a unified method for treating all the spectral\ntypes of Hermitian operators, by properly taking into account their spectral\nmultiplicities.\nThis problem is closely related to the description of isometries between\nthe Hilbert spaces Ck and Cn , 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n. The isometries are operators\ngenerated by n \u00d7 k or k \u00d7 n matrices whose columns, and respectively rows,\nare orthogonal, and in the following we show that there is a close relationship\nbetween these isometries and different matrix realizations of the coset spaces\ngenerated as in (1.1). The necessity of working with matrices that have\northogonal column vectors, or row vectors, became evident in the last years;\nsee e.g. [3], [4].\nThe mathematical background necessary for obtaining such results are\nelementary facts from the spectral theory of self-adjoint operators and the\ntheory of contraction operators, and a trivial lemma that we state here for\nthe case of the n-dimensional unitary group G = U (n); for the general case\nsee [5].\n4\n\n\fLemma 1. The coset relation\nX\u223c\n= U (n)/K\n\n(1.7)\n\nwhere K \u2282 U (n) is a subgroup, can be written as a matrix relation in the\nfollowing form\nMn = An BK\n\n(1.8)\n\nwhere Mn \u2208 U (n) is an arbitrary n \u00d7 n unitary matrix, An \u2208 U (n) is a\nunitary matrix parameterized by a point of the coset X, and BK \u2208 K is\nan arbitrary element of the subgroup K viewed as an element embedded in\nU (n).\nBy using it we obtain new parameterizations of flag, Stiefel and Grassmann manifolds. The paper is a sequel of our results concerning the factorization of unitary matrices [2] in terms of n complex vectors vi \u2208 S 2i\u22121 , i =\n1, . . . , n, where S k is the k-dimensional sphere in Cn . We denote by M (n, k)\nthe set of all n \u00d7 k complex matrices over Cn , and the main mathematical\nresult of the paper is:\nMain Theorem. Let C \u2208 M (n, k) be an n \u00d7 k complex matrix that\ngenerates an isometry, i.e. C : Ck \u2192 Cn , C\u2217 C = Ik . Then, the matrix\nrepresentation of the coset generated by the point C is realized in terms of a\nunitary matrix A(n, k) that diagonalizes the projection DT \u2217 , where DT \u2217 is\nthe defect operator associated to the isometry C, under the form\nIn \u2212 DT \u2217 = A(n, k)\n\n\u0012\n\nIk\n0\n0 0n\u2212k\n\n\u0013\n\n\u2217\n\nA(n, k) =\n\nk\nX\n\nci * c\u2217i = C C\u2217\n\n(1.9)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere ci , i = 1, . . . , k, are the (orthogonal) column vectors of C.\nAll the other results discussed in this work are a consequence of the\nabove theorem.\nThe organization of paper is as follows. In section 2 we show the close\nrelationship between the isometries C \u2208 M (n, k) and matrix realizations\nof the coset spaces. In section 3 we reformulate our results [2] in a more\nconvenient form for the present applications, and we find the generic parameterization of n-dimensional Hermitian operators. In section 4 we obtain our\nmatrix parameterizations of Stiefel and Grassmann manifolds. The paper\nends with Conclusion.\n5\n\n\f2\n\nIsometries\n\nIn this section we show how the isometries C \u2208 M (n, k) can be used for\nthe parameterization of various interesting manifolds. The main idea is\nthat the isometries generated by k rows, or columns of an arbitrary n \u00d7 n\nmatrix, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n, allow to define projection operators whose spectral\ndecomposition provides the necessary tool in finding matrix representations\nof various interesting manifolds. For what follows, we need a few elementary\nnotions from contraction operator theory; we use this theory since it has a\npowerful functional calculus that help us in doing explicit calculations.\nAn operator T applying the Hilbert space H in the Hilbert space H\u2032 is\na contraction if for any v \u2208 H, ||T v||H\u2032 \u2264 ||v||H, i.e. ||T || \u2264 1, where ||T ||\ndenotes the norm of T [13]. For any contraction we have T \u2217 T \u2264 IH and\nT T \u2217 \u2264 IH\u2032 , where T \u2217 denotes the adjoint, that is defined by the relation\n(T v, v \u2032 ) = (v, T \u2217 v \u2032 ), v \u2208 H, v \u2032 \u2208 H\u2032 , and (*, *) is the usual inner product\nin H, or, respectively, H\u2032 . To any contraction T one associates two defect\noperators by the relations\nDT = (IH \u2212 T \u2217 T )1/2 ,\n\nDT \u2217 = (IH\u2032 \u2212 T T \u2217 )1/2\n\n(2.1)\n\nthat are Hermitian operators in H and H\u2032 , respectively. They have the\nproperty\nT DT = DT \u2217 T,\n\nT \u2217 DT \u2217 = DT T \u2217\n\n(2.2)\n\nFinite-dimensional contractions can be seen as being generated by n \u00d7 k, or\nk \u00d7 n matrices, and for definiteness we consider the first case, i.e. T has n\nrows and k columns and we denote it by C. In the following we are interested\nin contractions of a special form, namely the isometries between Ck and Cn .\nThey are operators T : Ck \u2192 Cn that satisfy T \u2217 T = Ik , k = 1, . . . , n, i.e.\nthe columns of T are orthogonal columns, and respectively, T : Cn \u2192 Ck\nthat satisfy T T \u2217 = Ik , when the k rows are orthogonal. With our choice,\ni.e. T is a n \u00d7 k matrix, we have the identification H \u2261 Ck and H\u2032 \u2261 Cn .\nFor an isometry C generated by k columns, the relations (2.1) give DT =\nDC = 0. However, in the following we preserve the notation for the defect\noperator DT , to be implied that it is generated by a definite contraction,\nand from the first relation (2.2) we deduce that\nDT \u2217 T = T DT = 0 = DT \u2217 C = \u03bb C\n\n(2.3)\n\ni.e. all columns of C are in the kernel of DT \u2217 . In other words, the k column\nvectors are the eigenvectors that correspond to the eigenvalue \u03bb = 0, and\n6\n\n\fthese eigenvectors are orthogonal. When DT = 0, the other defect operator\nDT \u2217 is a projection, i.e. a self-adjoint operator which satisfies DT \u2217 = DT2 \u2217 ,\nand we infer that rank DT \u2217 = n \u2212 k; thus In \u2212 DT \u2217 projects onto the\neigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue \u03bb = 1. Then, from the preceding\nrelation, we get\n(In \u2212 DT \u2217 )C = In C = C = \u03bbC\n\n(2.4)\n\ni.e. the k column vectors of C are the orthogonal eigenvectors of In \u2212 DT \u2217\ncorresponding to the k eigenvalues \u03bb = 1, or in other words, rank (In \u2212 DT \u2217 )\n= k.\nFor us the interesting objects are the unitary matrices that diagonalize\nthe projections DT \u2217 and In \u2212 DT \u2217 . Let A(n, k) be the unitary matrix which\ndiagonalizes the projection DT \u2217 , then\n\u0012\n\u0013\n0k\n0\n\u2217\nA(n, k) DT \u2217 A(n, k) =\n(2.5)\n0 In\u2212k\nand from it we obtain a matrix representation of the projection DT \u2217 under\nthe form\n\u0012\n\u0013\n0k\n0\nDT \u2217 = A(n, k)\nA(n, k)\u2217\n(2.6)\n0 In\u2212k\nBut we also have\n\u2217\n\nA(n, k) (In \u2212 D )A(n, k) =\nT\u2217\n\n\u0012\n\nIk\n0\n0 0n\u2212k\n\n\u0013\n\n(2.7)\n\nrelation which can be written as\nIn \u2212 DT \u2217 = A(n, k)\n\n\u0012\n\nIk\n0\n0 0n\u2212k\n\n\u0013\n\nA(n, k)\u2217 =\n\nk\nX\n\nci * c\u2217i = C C\u2217\n\n(2.8)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere ci , i = 1, . . . , k, are the column vectors of the isometry C. Equations\n(2.6) and (2.8) provide matrix representations for both the projections on the\nn \u2212 k-, and respectively k-dimensional, subspaces of Cn . In our applications\nA(n, k) will be an n \u00d7 n unitary matrix generated by a coset as in Lemma\n1, coset, which at its turn, is parametrized by the point C.\nThe above representation does not provide a full explicit form for the\nmatrix A(n, k). We know only that its first k columns coincide with the C\ncolumns. Thus an important problem is the completion of the matrix A(n, k)\n7\n\n\fwith n \u2212 k columns without introducing new parameters, i.e. the next n \u2212 k\ncolumns must be determined by the first k columns. For doing that we\nneed a parameterization of the first k columns and the most convenient one\nis to introduce generalized spherical coordinates. In the next section we\nshow that the most important case is k = 1, the other cases being a direct\nconsequence of it, which leads to a factorization of unitary matrices. In the\nsame time, we reformulate our results from [2], concerning factorization of\nunitary matrices, that will provide the necessary tools for obtaining matrix\nrealizations for symmetric manifolds.\n\n3\n\nFactorization of unitary matrices\n\nThe idea behind such a factorization comes from the following sequence\nU (n) \u223c\n=\n\nU (n \u2212 1)\nU (2)\nU (n)\n\u00d7\n\u00d7 *** \u00d7\n\u00d7 U (1)\nU (n \u2212 1) U (n \u2212 2)\nU (1)\n\u223c\n= S 2n\u22121 \u00d7 S 2n\u22123 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 S 3 \u00d7 S 1\n\n(3.1)\n\nsequence that shows that each factor can be parameterized by an arbitrary\npoint on the corresponding complex sphere.\nThe factorization comes from the relation (3.1) which we write as\nS 2n\u22121 \u223c\n= U (n)/U (n \u2212 1)\n\n(3.2)\n\nSimilarly to relation (1.8), we rewrite (3.2) as\n1\nMn = Bn0 Mn\u22121\n\n(3.3)\n\nwhere Mn \u2208 U (n) is an arbitrary n\u00d7n matrix, Bn0 \u2208 U (n) is a special matrix\ngenerated by one of its column vectors, for example by its first column vector,\nwhich at its turn is parameterized by a point z \u2208 S 2n\u22121 , and\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n0\n1\nMn\u22121 =\n(3.4)\n0 Mn\u22121\nwhere Mn\u22121 \u2208 U (n \u2212 1) is an arbitrary (n \u2212 1) \u00d7 (n \u2212 1) matrix. For further\ndetails see [2]. By iteration of (3.4), we arrive at the form\n1\nMn = Bn0 * Bn\u22121\n. . . B1n\u22121\n\n8\n\n(3.5)\n\n\fk\nis generated by a column vector, and here is the point where\nwhere each Bn\u2212k\nan explicit parametrization enters. First we remind that a standard parameterization of U (n) is given in terms of n(n \u2212 1)/2 angles, \u03b8i \u2208 [0, \u03c0/2], i =\n1, . . . , n(n \u2212 1)/2, and n(n + 1)/2 phases, \u03c6i \u2208 [0, 2 \u03c0), i = 1, . . . , n(n + 1)/2,\nsee e.g. [1], [9].\nThe matrix realization of formula (3.5), which is the main result in [2],\nis given by\n\nTheorem 1. Any element Mn \u2208 U (n) can be factored into an ordered product of n matrices of the following form\n1\n. . . B1n\u22121\nMn = Bn0 * Bn\u22121\n\n(3.6)\n\nwhere\n\nk\nBn\u2212k\n\n=\n\n\u0012\n\nIk\n0\n0 Bn\u2212k\n\n\u0013\n\nand Bn\u2212k \u2208 U (n \u2212 k) are special unitary matrices, each one generated by\na single complex (n \u2212 k)-dimensional unit vector, bn\u2212k \u2208 S 2(n\u2212k)\u22121 . For\nexample B1n\u22121 = ei\u03c6 , where \u03c6 is an arbitrary phase.\nIf ym \u2208 S 2m\u22121 , m = 1, . . . , n, is parameterized by\nym = (ei\u03c61 cos \u03b81 , ei\u03c62 sin \u03b81 cos \u03b82 , . . . , ei\u03c6m sin \u03b81 . . . sin \u03b8m\u22121 )t\nwhere t denotes transpose, the m columns of Bm are given by\n\uf8eb\n\nv1 = y m\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n=\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\nei\u03c61 cos \u03b81\nei\u03c62 sin \u03b81 cos \u03b82\n*\n*\n*\nei\u03c6m sin \u03b81 . . . sin \u03b8m\u22121\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\nand\nvk+1 =\n\nd\nv1 (\u03b81 = * * * = \u03b8k\u22121 = \u03c0/2),\nd \u03b8k\n\nk = 1, . . . , m \u2212 1,\n\nwhere in the above formula one calculates first the derivative and afterwords\nthe restriction to \u03c0/2.\n9\n\n\fThe essential point of the algorithm for getting (3.6) was the use of\ncontraction operator theory to construct all the eigenvectors of a self-adjoint\nprojector, generated by the first column vector of Bn0 , eigenvectors that are\neasy provided by the above theorem, if the first vector generating them is\nparameterized in spherical coordinates.\nTaking into account that by multiplication at left of an arbitrary matrix\nfrom U (n) by a diagonal phase matrix dn = (ei\u03c61 , . . . , ei\u03c6n ), the first row is\nmultiplied by ei\u03c61 , the second by ei\u03c62 , etc., and the last one by ei\u03c6n we can\nwrite Bn0 = dn B \u0303n0 where the first column of B\u0303n0 \u2208 SO(n) has non-negative\nentries.\nFor our aims we need an explicit parameterization of Bn\u2212k , k = 0, . . . , n\u2212\n1, and we choose the n generating vectors as follows\nyn = (ei\u03b11 cos a1 , ei\u03b12 sin a1 cos a2 , . . . , , ei\u03b1n sin a1 . . . sin an\u22121 )t\nyn\u22121 = (ei\u03b21 cos b1 , ei\u03b22 sin b1 cos b2 , . . . , ei\u03b2n\u22121 sin b1 . . . sin bn\u22122 )t\n....................................................................................................\ny2 = (ei\u03c81 cos z1 , ei\u03c82 sin z1 )t\n\n(3.7)\n\ny1 = ei\u03c91\nThe projection operator In \u2212 DT \u2217 entering formula (2.8) is a self-adjoint\noperator, and for such an operator its eigenvectors ci are defined up to\nan overall phase. We choose the phases such that the first entry of each\neigenvector is a nonnegative number. With the generating vectors of the\nform (3.7), the parameterization of the matrix (3.6), given by Theorem 1,\nis such that its first row entries have the form\nm11 = ei\u03b11 cos a1 , m12 = \u2212ei(\u03b11 +\u03b21 ) cos b1 sin a1 ,\nm13 = ei(\u03b11 +\u03b21 +\u03b31 ) cos c1 sin a1 sin b1 , . . . ,\nm1n = (\u22121)n\u22121 ei(\u03b11 +***+\u03c91 ) sin a1 . . . sin z1\n\n(3.8)\n\nand if we want that these matrix elements should be nonnegative we have\nto take\n\u03b11 = 0,\n\n\u03b21 = \u03b31 = * * * = \u03c91 = \u03c0\n\n(3.9)\n\nIn the following we shall use in relations (3.7) these constraints, and so\nwe remove the first phase of each of the vectors yk and change the numbering\nas \u03b1i \u2192 \u03b1i\u22121 , i = 2, . . . , n, \u03b2i \u2192 \u03b2i\u22121 , i = 2, . . . , n \u2212 1, etc., and now each\nvector yk is parameterized by 2(k \u2212 1) parameters, k = 2, . . . , n, i.e. an\n10\n\n\fequal number of phases and angles. In this way the last vector disappears,\nsuch that the relation (3.6) has the following form\n1\nMn = Bn0 * Bn\u22121\n. . . B2n\u22122\n\n(3.10)\n\nThe last matrix is the matrix realization of the flag manifold\nF l(n) \u223c\n=\n\nU (n)\nU (n)\n\u223c\n=\nU (1) \u00d7 U (1) \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 U (1)\nU (1)n\n\n(3.11)\n\nit depends on n(n \u2212 1) parameters and it is the most general form of a\nunitary matrix that diagonalizes an n-dimensional Hermitian operator H\nwhose all the eigenvalues are simple. In the same time F l(n) is the 'natural'\nmanifold on which one can define a symplectic structure, and an interesting\nproblem would be to find its explicit form.\nPutting together the information contained in Theorem 1 and formulas\n(3.10) and (3.11) we have the following\nCorollary 1. The matrix Mn describes the spectral decomposition of a\nfinite-dimensional Hermitian operator H whose eigenvalues are simple, i.e.\nthey satisfy a relation as\n\u03bb 1 > \u03bb2 > * * * > \u03bbn\nand the operator H is written in the form\nH=\n\nn\nX\n\n\u03bbi ui u\u2217i\n\n(3.12)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere ui , i = 1, . . . , n, are the column vectors of the matrix (3.10). If\nH \u2265 0 and T r H = h \u2208 R\u2217+ , then \u03bbi , entering formula (3.12), could be\nparameterized as\n\u03bb1 = h cos2 \u03b81 , \u03bb2 = h sin2 \u03b81 cos2 \u03b82 , . . . , \u03bbn = h sin2 \u03b81 . . . sin2 \u03b8n\u22121(3.13)\nwhere \u03b8i \u2208 [0, \u03c0/2], i = 1, . . . , n \u2212 1, are arbitrary angles. If H is a density\noperator, h = 1 in the above relation.\nIf H is not positive definite, let suppose that its first p eigenvalues are\npositive, and n \u2212 p are negative. If T r H = 0, and h = T r H\u03bbi >0 =\n\u2212T r H\u03bbi <0 \u2208 R\u2217+ , then a parameterization of eigenvalues is given by\n\u03bb1 = h cos2 \u03b81 , \u03bb2 = h sin2 \u03b81 cos2 \u03b82 , . . . , \u03bbp = h sin2 \u03b81 . . . sin2 \u03b8p\u22121(, 3.14)\n11\n\n\f\u03bbp+1 = \u2212h cos2 \u03b8p , . . . , \u03bbn = \u2212h sin2 \u03b8p . . . sin2 \u03b8n\u22121\n\n(3.15)\n\nIf T r H = h 6= 0, the parameterization of eigenvalues is given by\n\u03bb1 = |h| cosh2 \u03b8, \u03bb2 = |h| cosh2 \u03b8 cos2 \u03b81 , . . . ,\n\u03bbp = |h| cosh2 \u03b8 sin2 \u03b81 . . . sin2 \u03b8p\u22122\n\n(3.16)\n\n\u03bbp+1 = \u2212|h| sinh2 \u03b8, . . . , \u03bbn = \u2212|h| sinh2 \u03b8 sin2 \u03b8p\u22121 . . . sin2 \u03b8n\u22122 (3.17)\nif h > 0, where \u03b8 \u2208 R\u2217+ , \u03b8i \u2208 [0, \u03c0/2], i = 1, . . . , n \u2212 2, are arbitrary angles,\nand by a similar formula in which one interchanges ch2 \u03b8 \u21cb sh2 \u03b8, if h < 0.\nIn this way, Corollary 1 gives a simple and explicit parameterization\nof all generic finite-dimensional Hermitian operators.\n\n4\n\nMatrix realizations of Stiefel and Grassmann\nmanifolds\n\nLooking at relation (3.11) we consider that the next simpler manifold is the\nStiefel manifold that we define as the coset space\nSt(k, n) \u223c\n=\n\nU (1)k\n\nU (n)\nF l(n)\n\u223c\n=\n\u00d7 U (n \u2212 k)\nF l(n \u2212 k)\n\n(4.1)\n\ninstead of the usual definition\nSt(k, n) \u223c\n=\n\nU (n)\nU (n \u2212 k)\n\n(4.2)\n\nBoth forms are similar, only the number of parameters entering them is\ndifferent. According to Lemma 1 we can write the first relation (4.1) as a\nmatrix relation\n\u0012\n\u0013\nIk\n0\nMn = A(n, k)\n(4.3)\n0 Mn\u2212k\nwhere Mn \u2208 U (n), Mn\u2212k \u2208 U (n \u2212 k) and A(n, k) \u2208 U (n) is the matrix realization of the Stiefel manifold St(k, n) parameterized by a point represented\nby a n \u00d7 k complex matrix, with the first row entries non-negative numbers.\n\n12\n\n\fAlternatively, we may consider that Mn \u2208 F l(n), Mn\u2212k \u2208 F l(n \u2212 k). Looking at relation (2.8) we see that A(n, k) is the same object in both relations\n(2.8) and (4.3). By consequence we deduce from (3.10) that\nk\u22121\n1\nA(n, k) = Bn0 * Bn\u22121\n. . . Bn\u2212k+1\n\n(4.4)\n\nis the matrix realization of the Stiefel manifold (4.1). Thus the following\nholds\nTheorem 2. The matrix representation of the Stiefel manifold St(k, n) as\ndefined by (4.1) is obtained from the parameterization (3.10) by taking zero\nall the parameters entering U (n \u2212 k), i.e. U (n \u2212 k) = In\u2212k such that\nk\u22121\n1\nA(n, k) = Bn0 * Bn\u22121\n. . . Bn\u2212k+1\n\n(4.5)\n\nBy using elementary facts from spectral theory of self-adjoint operators we\nfind that the matrix representation of the projection In \u2212 DT \u2217 writes as\nIn \u2212 DT \u2217 = St(k, n) = c1 c\u22171 + * * * + ck c\u2217k\n\n(4.6)\n\nwhere ci , i = 1, . . . , k are the first k column vectors of (4.5). As long as the\nmatrix (4.5) is parameterized by d1 = n2 \u2212 k \u2212 (n \u2212 k)2 = k(2n \u2212 k \u2212 1) real\nparameters, we can choose any k \u0001column vectors of (4.5) in formula (4.6)\nand we can make this choice in nk modes. If the form (4.2) is used, then\nk\u22121\n1\nA(n, k) = Bn0 * Bn\u22121\n. . . Bn\u2212k+1\n\n(4.7)\n\np\n, p = 0, . . . , k \u22121 are the first k matrices entering equation (3.6),\nwhere Bn\u2212p\ni.e. the complex vectors generating (4.7) are such as in the written form\n(3.7), comprising n(n + 1)/2 phases. The difference between the forms (4.5)\nand (4.7) consists in the number of real parameters entering them: (4.5) is\nparameterized by d1 parameters, while (4.7) depends on d2 = n2 \u2212 (n \u2212 k)2 =\nk(2n \u2212 k) parameters.\n\nRemark. Similarly to F l(n), on the Stiefel manifold (4.1) one can define\na symplectic structure.\nAs a consequence of the above theorem, we have the following\nCorollary 2. The matrix (4.5) describes the spectral decomposition of a\nfinite-dimensional Hermitian operator H that has a degenerate eigenvalue\nof multiplicity k, \u03bbi = * * * = \u03bbk , and all the other eigenvalues are simple. In\nthis case H writes as\nH = \u03bb1\n\nk\nX\nj=1\n\nuj u\u2217j +\n\nn\u2212k\nX\ni=1\n\n13\n\n\u03bbk+i ui+k u\u2217i+k\n\n(4.8)\n\n\fwhere ui , i = 1, . . . , n, are the column vectors of the matrix (4.5). If H is a\ndensity operator, then\n\u03bb1 = cos2 \u03b81 , \u03bbk+1 = sin2 \u03b81 cos2 \u03b82 , . . . , \u03bbn = sin2 \u03b81 sin2 \u03b82 . . . sin2 \u03b8n\u2212k\u22121\nwhere \u03b8i \u2208 [0, \u03c0/2], i = 1, . . . , n \u2212 k \u2212 1 are arbitrary angles. If H is not\npositive definite, the eigenvalues are parameterized by similar formulas, as\nin Corollary 1.\nThe Grassmann manifold, Gr(k, n), is defined as the set of all k-dimensiononal subspaces of Cn , and a main problem is to have a simple description\nof this variety. From what was said before, evidently there is a one-to-one\ncorrespondence between k-dimensional subspaces, k-dimensional projections\nand a unitary operator like A(n, k). The first problem is to determine the\nnumber of independent parameters entering A(n, k) for this case. Taking\ninto account that k- and n \u2212 k-dimensional subspaces are transformed into\nk- and respectively n\u2212k-dimensional subspaces under the action of matrices\nfrom U (k) \u2282 U (n) and respectively U (n \u2212 k) \u2282 U (n), Gr(k, n) is viewed as\nthe coset space\nGr(k, n) \u223c\n=\n\nF l(n)\nU (n)\n\u223c\n=\nU (k) \u00d7 U (n \u2212 k)\nF l(k) \u00d7 F l(n \u2212 k)\n\n(4.9)\n\nand by consequence the real dimension of the Grassmann manifold Gr(k, n)\nequals\nd = n2 \u2212 k2 \u2212 (n \u2212 k)2 = 2 k(n \u2212 k)\n\n(4.10)\n\nLike the case of Stiefel manifolds, we want first to obtain a parameterization of A(n, k) which is equivalent with finding a parameterization of\nGrassmannians. With that end in view we rewrite relation (4.9) into the\nform\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\nBk\n0\nIk\n0\nMn = A(n, k)\n\u00d7\n(4.11)\n0 In\u2212k\n0 Cn\u2212k\nwhere Mn \u2208 U (n) is an arbitrary matrix from U (n) and Bk \u2208 U (k) and\nrespectively Cn\u2212k \u2208 U (n \u2212 k). Such a relation is always possible since any\ngroup operation is uniquely written as the product of an element in the\nsubgroup with an element of the coset. From that relation we infer that\n14\n\n\fthe number of independent parameters entering A(n, k) is the same as the\ndimension d of the Grassmann manifold Gr(k, n).\nIf we look at the relations (3.10) or (4.5) and consider one of them for\nthe case k = 1 we observe that Bn0 is equal to A(n, 1). Thus we obtain a\nmatrix representation for\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n0\nIn \u2212 P = Gr(1, n) = A(n, 1)\nA\u2217 (n, 1)\n(4.12)\n0 0n\u22121\ni.e. the simplest Grassmannian, a result already known. The preceding\nrelation can be written in an equivalent form as\nGr(1, n) = v1 * v1\u2217\n\n(4.13)\n\nwhere v1 is the vector that generates Bn0 , i.e. the vector yn from relation\n(3.7). Thus A(n, 1) can be obtained from (3.10) by taking all the phases\nand angles entering U (n \u2212 1) equal to zero, i.e. U (n \u2212 1) = In\u22121 , and here\nwe give its explicit form\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ec\nA(n, 1) = \uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n\uf8f6\n\n1\nei\u03b11\n...\nei\u03b1n\u22121\n\ncos a1\n\u2212 sin a1\n0\n0\nsin a1 cos a2\ncos a1 cos a2 \u2212 sin a2 0\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\nsin a1 . . . sin an\u22121\n...\n...\n...\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n(4.14)\n\n0\n0\n0\n\u2212 sin an\u22121\ncos an\u22121\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\nwhere we factored out the diagonal phase matrix. This formula provides an\nexplicit form of the vectors vi that are generated by Theorem 1.\nIn the following we show that A(n, k) can be obtained in a similar way.\nTaking into account the form of the projection operator In \u2212 P and the\ndimensions d1 and d for Stiefel and Grassmann manifolds respectively, we\ninfer that the Grassmann manifold is a special case of a Stiefel manifold.\nOur problem now is to find those constraints which lead to the correct\nparameterization of A(n, k) for Grassmannians.\nIn order to view which are the constraints, let us consider the case k = 2.\nBy taking into account that the first column of A(n, 2) coincides with the\n15\n\n\ffirst column of the matrix (4.14), we infer from (4.10) that the parameterization of the second column is given in terms of 2(n \u2212 3) new real parameters.\nThis means that we have to remove an angle and a phase from the vector\nyn\u22121 , equation (3.7). A convenient choice is to take equal to zero the last\nangle and phase, i.e. bn\u22122 = \u03b2n\u22122 = 0. This choice induces the following\n1\nform for the matrix Bn\u22121\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n1\n0\n0\n1,1\n1\nBn\u22121\n(bn\u22122 = \u03b2n\u22122 = 0) = Bn\u22121\n= \uf8ed 0 Bn\u22122 0 \uf8f8\n(4.15)\n0\n0\n1\nwhere Bn\u22122 is generated as in Theorem 1 by the vector\n\u2032\n\nyn\u22122 = (cos b1 , ei\u03b21 sin b1 cos b2 , . . . , ei\u03b2n\u22123 sin b1 . . . sin bn\u22123 )t\n\n(4.16)\n\nIt is easily seen that this structure preserves from k \u2192 k + 1 such that\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nIk\n0\n0\nn\nk,k\nk = 1, . . . , [ ]\nBn\u2212k\n= \uf8ed 0 Bn\u22122k 0 \uf8f8 ,\n(4.17)\n2\n0\n0\nIk\n\nwhere [a] denotes the integer part of a, and Bn\u22122k , k = 1, . . . , [ n2 ], are generated by the vectors\nw1 = (cos a1 , ei\u03b11 sin a1 cos a2 , . . . , , ei\u03b1n\u22121 sin a1 . . . sin an\u22121 )t\nw2 = (cos b1 , ei\u03b21 sin b1 cos b2 , . . . , ei\u03b2n\u22123 sin b1 . . . sin bn\u22123 )t\n..........................................................................................................\nwp = (cos l1 , ei\u03c61 sin l1 cos l2 , . . . , ei\u03c6n\u2212(2p\u22121) sin l1 . . . sin ln\u2212(2p\u22121) )t (4.18)\n...........................................................................................................\nw[n/2] = (cos z1 , ei\u03c91 sin z1 cos z2 , ei\u03c92 sin z1 sin z2 )t , for n odd\nw[n/2] = (cos z1 , ei\u03c91 sin z1 )t , for n even\nWith the above notation the following holds\n\nTheorem 3.

If H is a density matrix operator, then \u03bb1 = cos2 \u03b8 and \u03bb2 = sin2 \u03b8,\nwhere \u03b8 \u2208 [0, \u03c0/2] is an arbitrary angle. With this choice, formula (4.22)\ndescribes all the density matrices that are solutions of the equation (1.2).\nWhen H is not positive definite, and T r H = h, the parameterization\nof eigenvalues is: \u03bb1 = h cosh2 \u03b8 and \u03bb2 = \u2212h sinh2 \u03b8, if \u03bb1 > |\u03bb2 |, and\n\u03bb1 = |h| sinh2 \u03b8 and \u03bb2 = \u2212|h| cosh2 \u03b8, if h < 0. .\nIn this way we succeeded to find an explicit parameterization for the\nfinite-dimensional Hermitian operators, in three cases: the generic case,\nwhen all the eigenvalues are different, an intermediate case when the first\nk eigenvalues are degenerated, the other eigenvalues being simple, and the\nmost \"degenerated\" case, when there exist only two (different) eigenvalues.\nMatrix realization of other flag manifolds, as e.g.\nF l(k1 , k2 , . . . , kl , ; n) \u223c\n=\n\nF l(n)\nF l(k1 ) \u00d7 F l(k2 ) \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 F l(kl )\n\n(4.23)\n\nP\nwith li ki \u2264 n, that describe other spectral multiplicities, can be found in\na similar way.

The flag matrix (3.10) encodes all the possible spectral decompositions of finite-dimensional Hermitian operators, acting on Cn , i.e.\nany other particular unitary matrix A(n, k) that describes a given spectral\nmultiplicity of an Hermitian operator can be obtained from it by properly\nrestricting the number of parameters entering (3.10).\nExample.

Further, this construction is recursive: if we\nhave a parameterization of Mn , Mn+2 is obtained by embedding Mn into\nMn+2 , and by multiplication at left by an appropriate matrix of the form\n(4.14), with n \u2192 n + 2. We have shown that the unitary matrices which\ndiagonalize the Hermitian operators are subsets of the flag unitary matrix\nMn whose explicit form is given by formula (3.10). When the eigenvalues\nare simple, the generic form of the unitary operators is Mn ; when there\nis a k-fold degeneracy, the corresponding unitary matrices are in the set\nSt(k, n). If there is a maximum degeneracy, i.e. only two eigenvalues, with\nmultiplicities k and, respectively n \u2212 k, are distinct, the unitaries are in\nthe Grassmannian G(k, n). Our explicit construction was done only for the\nn-dimensional unitary group U (n), but it is evident that the same approach\nworks in the case of any compact group. For example, taking zero all the\nphases entering U (n) and doing similar calculations, one gets results for\nSO(n), and so on.\nWe consider that the above parameterization will be useful for doing\ncalculation, especially for problems where one has to make an optimization\nover a set of parameters, e.g. for the characterization of entanglement.\nTaking also into account our previous results [2], which state that any\nunitary matrix entering Mn is an ordered product of n \u2212 1 diagonal phase\nmatrices and n(n \u2212 1)/2 two-dimensional rotations, one can make use of\nthe device designed by Reck et al [10] to give an operational meaning in\nthe real world to any finite-level Hermitian operator. This means that all\nthe Hermitian matrices could be experimentally implemented and, by consequence, could be measured. Such multi-states devices will find applications\nin quantum information processing and quantum computation.\nIn the same time, we obtained a new and simple analytic representation of Stiefel and Grassmann manifolds, representation that is essentially\ncontained in a unitary matrix A(n, k), which can be easy stored into a computer, and problems similar to those encountered in [3], or [16] will be easier\nto solve.\nOur results show also that there are two new symmetric spaces Mn ,\nand St(k, n), defined as in (4.1), on which one can implement a symplectic\nstructure, and an interesting problem would be the finding of the relationship\nbetween a generic Hermitian operator on these symmetric spaces and the\nLaplace-Beltrami operator on the corresponding manifold. Some of these\nproblems will be considered elsewhere.\n19\n\n\fAcknowledgments\nThe author wants to thank the anonymous referee of his paper [2] who\nrecommended the following:\n[. . . ] I recommend that the factorization theorem be stated\nclearly in the early part of the paper and that it be followed\nby a construction algorithm.
