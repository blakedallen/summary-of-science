Introduction\nIn 1989 a new interferometric setup was proposed by J. D. Franson [1]. The main\nintent was to test the possibility of local realist models as a possible description, more\ncomplete than quantum mechanics. The sinusoidal interference obtained from the\nexperiment when restricting to coincident events is larger than the bound from given\nby the Bell inequality [2]. But the selection of coincident events at the two sites\nintroduces postselection into the data analysis. This need for postselection has been\nunder discussion for some time [3\u20138], and this paper is intended to review the discussion\nand to provide some insight into the matter at hand. We will see that, depending on\nwhat is required from the tested model class, the appropriate inequality changes so that\nthe same experimental outcomes in some cases do violate the Bell inequality as usual,\nand in some cases do not. Interestingly, the class of models that uses EPR elements of\nreality (and nothing more) falls between these two, and violates the Bell inequality at a\nlesser degree than in other setups.\nThe paper is organized as follows: the rest of the Introduction is devoted to\nbackground, in a level of detail that enables an in-depth discussion in what follows.\nSection 2 introduces the Franson interferometer and discusses effects of postselection.\nIn section 3 the usual Bell inequality is re-established by adding path realism to the\nmodel class. Section 4 concentrates on using only EPR elements of reality, giving a\nweaker inequality but nonetheless a violation of local realism, and section 5 contains a\nfew examples of modified experimental setups and their properties.\nA central concept in this analysis is \"EPR elements of reality\" as proposed by\nEinstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (EPR) in 1935 [9]. The concept is well-known, but a brief\nrepetition is in place. The setting is as follows: consider a (small) physical system on\nwhich we intend to measure position Q or momentum P . The physical measurement\ndevices associated with these measurements are mutually exclusive, and furthermore, the\nquantum-mechanical description for this physical system tells us that the measurements\nQ and P do not commute. The standard way to interpret this is that the system does\nnot possess the properties of position or momentum, only probabilities are possible to\nobtain from quantum mechanics.\nWhat EPR ask in their paper is whether the quantum-mechanical description\ncan be considered complete, or if it is possible to argue for another, more complete\ndescription. They use a combined system of two subsystems A and B of the above type in\na combined state, so that measurement of the sum of the positions gives QA +QB = 0 and\nmeasurement of the momentum difference gives PA \u2212 PB = 0. These two combinations\nare measurable at the same time even though the individual positions and momenta are\nnot, which means that it is possible to produce a joint state with these properties. Letting\nthe two subsystems separate, usually very far, they consider individual measurement\nof position or momentum. The system is such that the position sum and momentum\ndifference is preserved under the separation process, which means that if the position of\none subsystem has been measured, the position of the remote subsystem can be predicted.\n\n\fEnergy-time entanglement, Elements of Reality, and Local Realism\n\u03c6A\n\n3\n\u03c6B\n\nSource\n+1\n\n+1\n\u22121\n\n\u22121\nFigure 1. The EPR-Bohm-Bell setup. The two systems are spin-1/2 systems, and the\nlocal measurements are made along a direction in space \u03c6A or \u03c6B , respectively. The\nsource is such that if the directions \u03c6A = \u03c6B , the outcomes A + B = 0 with probability\none.\n\nTherefore, EPR argue, the position of the remote subsystem must exist as a property of\nthe subsystem. EPR write:\nIf, without in any way disturbing a system, we can predict with certainty (i.e.,\nwith a probability equal to unity) the value of a physical quantity, then there\nexists an element of physical reality corresponding to this physical quantity.\nLikewise, if the momentum of one subsystem has been measured, the momentum\nof the remote subsystem can be predicted. In this case, the momentum of the remote\nsubsystem must exist as a property of the subsystem. EPR continue to argue that both\nposition and momentum must simultaneously exist as properties of the remote subsystem,\notherwise\n. . . the reality of P and Q depend[s] upon the process of measurement carried\nout on the first system, which does not disturb the second [remote] system in\nany way. No reasonable definition of reality could be expected to permit this.\nThe above definition of an \"EPR element of reality\" is the philosophical motivation\nfor considering properties of a system as existing, independent of measurement. The\npossibility of remote prediction (\"without in any way disturbing a system\") enables the\nnotion of EPR element of reality, and we will use this notion below to motivate existence\nof properties of the involved physical systems.\nA measurement setup more suited to experiment was proposed by Bohm in the\nfifties [10] (see figure 1), and uses a system combined of two spin-1/2 subsystems in a total\nspin 0 state, so that the spins A + B = 0 when measured along equal directions \u03c6A = \u03c6B .\nThe subsystems are allowed to separate and a spin measurement is made on one of the\nsubsystems. The choice of measurement directions is a continuous choice instead of\nthe dichotomic choice in the original EPR setup. When a measurement has been made\non one subsystem, the result can be used to predict the result of a measurement on\nthe remote subsystem along the same direction. And because the reality of the spin\nmeasurement result in the remote system cannot depend on the local choice, the spin\nalong any direction is an EPR element of reality.\nThis was used in the celebrated Bell paper [2] where a statistical test was devised\nin the form of an inequality that must be fulfilled by any mathematical model that is\n\n\fEnergy-time entanglement, Elements of Reality, and Local Realism\n\n4\n\nrealist and local. Here, realism is motivated by the spin being an EPR element of reality,\nand locality by the finite speed of light, or more specifically, because local measurement\nis made \"without in any way disturbing\" the remote system (the formulation below is\nadapted from [11]).\nTheorem 1. A local realist model has the following two properties:\nRealism. Measurement outcomes can be described by two families of random variables.\nA is the outcome for site 1 with local setting \u03c6A and B the outcome for site 2 with\nlocal setting \u03c6B :\nA(\u03c6A , \u03c6B , \u03bb) and B(\u03c6A , \u03c6B , \u03bb)\nwhere the absolute values of the outcomes are bounded by 1. The dependence on the\nhidden variable \u03bb is usually suppressed in the notation\nLocality. Outcomes do not depend on the remote settings\nA(\u03c6A , \u03c6B , \u03bb) = A(\u03c6A , \u03bb),\n\nB(\u03c6A , \u03c6B , \u03bb) = B(\u03c6B , \u03bb).\n\nBy writing Ai = A(\u03c6A,i ) and Bj = B(\u03c6B,j ) the outcomes from a local realist model obey\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\nE A1 B1 + E A1 B2\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\n+ E A2 B1 \u2212 E A2 B2\n\n\u0011\n\n\u2264 2.\n\n(1)\n\nInequality (1) is violated by the predictions of quantum mechanics, for instance\nmeasurement on a state with total spin zero gives the correlation\nD\n\nE\n\nA(\u03c6A )B(\u03c6B ) = \u2212 cos(\u03c6A \u2212 \u03c6B )\n\n(2)\n\nwith \u03c6A \u2212 \u03c6B being the angle between the two directions \u03c6A and \u03c6B . Choosing the four\ndirections \u03c0/4 apart in a plane in the order b1 , a1 , b2 and a2 one obtains\nD\n\nE\n\nD\n\nA1 B1 + A1 B2\n\nE\n\n+\n\nD\n\nE\n\nD\n\nA2 B1 \u2212 A2 B2\n\nE\n\n\u221a\n= 2 2,\n\n(3)\n\nand this violates inequality (1). Therefore, the quantum-mechanical predictions cannot\nbe obtained from a local realist model.\nThere is one problem that is present in most experiments done to test this inequality:\ninefficient detectors. This problem was first noticed by Pearle in 1970 [12] but has been\ntreated in many subsequent papers. The problem is that only pairs with coincident\ndetections are obtained, which is a subset of all pairs emitted by the source. The\ncorrelation obtained from experiment is conditioned on coincident detection of two\nparticles, one at each side. Taking this into account, the theorem needs to be modified\nas follows (adapted from [11]).\nTheorem 2. A local realist model with inefficiency has the following three properties:\nRealism. Outcomes are given by random variables on subsets of detection (in a\nprobability space (\u039b, F, P )),\nA(\u03c6A , \u03c6B , \u03bb) on \u039bA,\u03c6A ,\u03c6B\n\nand\n\nB(\u03c6A , \u03c6B , \u03bb) on \u039bB,\u03c6A ,\u03c6B .\n\n\fEnergy-time entanglement, Elements of Reality, and Local Realism\n\n5\n\nLocality.

We will see effects and\nextensions of this below.\n2. The Franson interferometer\nIn 1989 a new experimental setup was proposed by Franson [1] (see figure 2). The\nsetup uses a source that emits time-correlated photons at unknown moments in time,\nand two analysis stations consisting of unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometers. The\nanalysis stations should have a path difference that is large enough to prohibit first-order\ninterference. Therefore, the probability is equal for a photon to emerge from each port of\nthe final beamsplitter. The path differences of the analysis stations should be as equal as\npossible; the path-difference difference (repetition intended) should be so small that the\nevents of both photons \"taking the long path\" and both photons \"taking the short path\"\nare indistinguishable. Quotation marks are used here to remind the reader that photons\nare not particles, but quantum objects and as such, do not take a specific path. Given\nthis indistinguability, since the emission time is unknown (and is a quantum variable in\nsecond quantization), there can be interference between two possibilities at the second\nbeamsplitter.\nThere will be no interference if one photon \"takes the long path\" and the other \"takes\nthe short\", because then the emission time can be calculated easily as the early detection\ntime minus the short path length divided by c. When this happens the emission time will\nbecome known. When both photons \"take the same path\", the emission time remains\nunknown, and this is what enables the interference. The interference is not visible as a\nchange in output intensity, as in first-order interference, but instead in correlation of the\noutputs. Given coincident detection, if the total phase modulation \u03c6A + \u03c6B = 0, then\na photon emerging in the +1 channel on the left is always accompanied by a photon\nemerging in the +1 channel on the right, and the same for the \u22121 channels.

These travel through analysis stations consisting of\nunbalanced (but equal) Mach-Zehnder interferometers with variable phase modulators\n\u03c6A and \u03c6B .

Does this mean that the Franson interferometer\nviolates local realism?\nThe answer is no. The problem is that there exists a local realist model that gives\nthe exact same predictions as quantum mechanics [4] (see figure 3). Since the model\nfulfulls the requirements of Theorem 1, it is strange that it seems to violate inequality (1).\nBut it only seems to give a violation. The model does not violate the inequality; it is\ntrue that the model gives the correlation\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nE A(\u03c6A )B(\u03c6B ) coinc. for A(\u03c6A ) and B(\u03c6B ) = cos(\u03c6A + \u03c6B ),\n\n(7)\n\nbut this is a conditional expectation of the type used in Theorem 2. We have stumbled\nupon a loophole that arises from the fact that we need to postselect coincident events,\nwhich means that we have to discard 50% of the events right away. This \"postselection\nloophole\" gives us a case that is similar to the detection loophole discussed in Theorem 2.\nMore accurately, we the following theorem from [13] can be established:\nTheorem 3.

The outcomes are determined by the above graphs where detections\nare \"early\" (E) or \"late\" (L). This model reproduces the quantum predictions for the\nFranson interferometric setup, including those for the coincident detections.\n\nDelays. Detections occur after local realist time delays,\nTA (\u03c6A ) : \u039b 7\u2192 R\n\nand TB (\u03c6B ) : \u039b 7\u2192 R,\n\nand usage of a coincidence window gives an apparent efficiency of\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03b7=\n\nmin P coincidence local detection .\n\nsettings\nlocal sites\n\nThe outcomes from a local realist model with delays obey\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\nE A1 B1 coinc. for A1 and B1 + E A1 B2 coinc. for A1 and B2\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n+ E A2 B1 coinc. for A2 and B1 \u2212 E A2 B2 coinc. for A2 and B2\n\n\u0011\n\n\u2264\n\n(8)\n6\n\u2212 4.\n\u03b7\n\nIn the Franson setup the delays are not continuously distributed but rather limited\nto two values: \"Early\" and \"Late\". Coincidence only occurs when these timeslots\nequal between the analysis stations, corresponding to a coincidence window smaller\nthan the delay. In inequality (8) the bound for quantum-mechanical violation is\n\u221a\n\u03b7 = 3 \u2212 3/ 2 \u2248 87.87%, which is higher than the standard bound. The apparent\nefficiency that arises in the Franson interferometer due to postselection is 50% even with\nideal detectors. It is therefore possible for a local realist model (like the one in figure 3)\nto violate inequality (8).\nAt this point we want to re-establish a violation. To do this we must first understand\nwhy Theorems 1 to 3 fail to provide a usable Bell test. What is the basic reason for the\nexistence of the model in figure 3? It is tempting to blame only the postselection, but\nthis is not the whole story. It should be noted that the theorems treat the individual\n\n\fEnergy-time entanglement, Elements of Reality, and Local Realism\n\n8\n\nsites as black boxes; feed them a setting and they give an outcome in the late or early\ntimeslot with a value of +1 or \u22121, much like the setup of figure 1. We will see that taking\nmore properties of the setup into account will enable a violation, and the remainder of\nthis paper will discuss the possible ways to do this.\n3. Path Realism\nThe key ingredient of the local realist model in figure 3 is that the timeslot in which\ndetection occurs at an analysis station depends on the relation between the hidden\nvariables (\u03b8, r) and the local setting (\u03c6A or \u03c6B ) at the analysis station. To avoid this, one\npossibility is to have the \"path taken by the photon\" as a realist property [5, 8], in essence\nrequiring particle-like properties of the photons. In this case, a photon will encounter the\nfirst beamsplitter before the variable phase modulation, so that the \"decision\" to \"take\nthe long path or the short path\" must be independent of the phase modulation setting\nof the analysis station-the local measurement chosen-in contrast to a standard Bell\nexperiment where only independence from the remote measurement choice is required.\nIt is certainly possible to list path realism as an expected model property and test\nit. It is however important to note that, in this setup, path realism is very different from\nmeasurement-outcome realism. The outcomes are EPR elements of reality because they\ncan be remotely predicted, and by locality they can be argued to exist independently of\nwhat remote measurement was made. On the other hand, the path taken is not an EPR\nelement of reality because it cannot be remotely predicted. There is no measurement at\none site that enables a path prediction for the remote site in the setup of figure 2.\nOne may attempt to argue for path realism by bringing in properties from classical\nphysics into the picture [5], which would make models like that in figure 3 inconsistent.\nHowever, the question at hand is not if an experiment like the above can be described\nwithin classical physics; there is no doubt that this is not possible. Instead, the question\nis whether the quantum-mechanical model can be considered complete. It is entirely\npossible that our classical intuition fails us, while quantum mechanics still can be\ncompleted. The discussion on EPR-Bell arguments is an attempt to find precisely what\nminimal requirements are needed to give a contradiction with quantum predictions.\nThis question cannot be answered if the model is required to obey some complicated\nrequirements from classical physics.\nAnother argument for path realism [8] would be to appeal to local prediction rather\nthan prediction from the remote site as EPR do. By measuring in one path and finding\nthe photon there it is possible to predict that it is not present in the other. Locality and\nspacelike separation between the paths could then be used as support for path realism,\nand one could even attempt to extend the notion of reality [8] by changing \"without in\nany way disturbing a system\" into \"spacelike separation\". This is a large modification\nof EPR elements of reality because EPR requires that a photon-when detected in one\npath-is a different undisturbed system when predicted not to be present in the other\npath, which is clearly not the case. It is true that finding the photon in one position\n\n\fEnergy-time entanglement, Elements of Reality, and Local Realism\n\n9\n\nenables a prediction that it is not anywhere else. But this cannot be used as evidence of\nan underlying realist model. Prediction of properties of one system immediately after\nmeasurement merely suggests that the measurement is repeatable.\nFurthermore, it is central in the EPR reasoning that the system that we predict\nproperties for is unaffected by the measurement used for predictions. EPR could choose\nto remotely predict position or momentum and therefore conclude the simultaneous\nreality of both. However, photon path is only available through a measurement in the\nlocal analysis station, and such a measurement prevents the remote prediction of the\nanalysis station output, since the interference is destroyed in the process. This means\nthat we cannot conclude in the same way that path and analysis station output both\nsimultaneously are realist properties. Even though it is claimed in Refs. [5, 8] that \"path\ntaken\" must be a realist property independently of whether the path measurement is\nperformed or not, this is clearly not supported by EPR-style reasoning.\nIf we choose to use path realism we must remember that path realism on its own\ndoes not prohibit interference. First order interference is not prohibited, since the model\ncould randomly select a path for the photon and send an \"empty wave\" through the other\npath, that registers any phase shift in that path. The phase shift difference can be used\nto determine through which output port to emit the photon from the second beamsplitter.\nSecond order interference in the present setup is also not directly prohibited by path\nrealism itself, because the same mechanism would work.\nHowever, large second order interference will be prohibited by the combination of\npath realism and local realist analysis station output. These two together will enable\nTheorem 1 separately both for Late-Late coincidences (both photons \"taking the long\npath\") and Early-Early coincidences (both photons \"taking the short path\"), because\nthe existence of a delay cannot depend on the local choice of phase modulator settings.\nThis re-establishes the bound on the whole set of coincidences [5].\nTheorem 4. A local realist model with path realism has the properties \"Realism\" and\n\"Locality\" from Theorem 1, and\nPath realism. The path taken is a realist property, and is setting-independent.\nThe outcomes from a local realist model with path realism obey\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\nE A1 B1 coinc. for A1 and B1 + E A1 B2 coinc. for A1 and B1\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n+ E A2 B1 coinc. for A1 and B1 \u2212 E A2 B2 coinc. for A1 and B1\n\n\u0011\n\n(9)\n\u2264 2.\n\nOf course, path realism requires intimate knowledge of the internals of the analysis\nstations, for example, that there really are two distinct paths used. This means that\npath realism makes it difficult to argue for device independence since the requirements\nused involve low-level properties of the devices. Also, an experiment meant to test the\ninequality needs to ensure that the \"decision\" to \"take the long or the short path\" really\nis independent of the phase modulator setting. This would be accomplished by space-like\nseparation of the choice of phase modulation and the \"photon's path choice\", that is, the\n\n\fEnergy-time entanglement, Elements of Reality, and Local Realism\n\n10\n\nevent of \"the photon passing the beamsplitter\". Since the experimenters do not know\nthe detection moments in advance, this must be done by switching the settings fast\nenough to ensure that a new random setting is chosen in-between these two events. This\nis in contrast to a Bell experiment where the setting choices only need to be chosen at\nspacelike separation from the emission and each other, which is a much less demanding\ntask.\nUsing path realism does have benefits, since postselection has no negative effects on\nthe bound. The appropriate inequality has the standard bound as in inequality (9) and\nis violated by the quantum prediction in equation (6). There is no local realist model\nwith path realism that gives the probabilities predicted by quantum mechanics for the\nFranson interferometer.\n4. Local realism only\nIt is now interesting to ask whether it is possible to obtain a violation using only EPR\nelements of reality. Obviously, local realist measurement outcomes is not enough. It\nis possible to establish another EPR element of reality in this setup, but it is slightly\ndifferent than the path realism used above. By replacing one of the analysis stations\nwith a single detector it is possible to measure the source emission time. This enables\nprediction of the emission moment for the remote photon, without in any way disturbing\nit. Therefore, the moment of emission is an EPR element of reality, which means that\na local realist model must be similar to the one in figure 3 in that it needs to specify\nwhether a detection is \"early\" or \"late\". This is not the same as specifying the path\nbecause it does not require particle-like behaviour of the quantum object (the photon\n\"takes a path\"). The only requirement is that the detection occurs in one of the two\ntimeslots, treating the analysis station like a black box just as it is in the original\nBohm-Bell setup. The important observation here is that the detection moment also is\nan element of reality and must be present in any local realist model.\nIn this situation, the settings \u03c6A and \u03c6B can still influence whether a delay occurs\nor not. The event that needs to be spacelike separated from the setting choices is no\nlonger \"passing the first beamsplitter\", a point in time which here is EPR element of\nreality, but the event of detection. This is because the detection is the event that gets\ndelayed (or not) in the local realist model. The problem is that detection takes place\nafter the photon has (or could have) passed the phase modulation, so it seems impossible\nto have spacelike separation between setting choice and detection event.\nFortunately, there are two possible detection events, one early and one late. This\nmeans that it is possible to have two different settings for the two detection events: one\nat the \"early-setting readoff\" event for the early detection, and one at the \"late-setting\nreadoff\" event for the late detection (see figure 4A). The choice of the early setting\ncannot be spacelike separated from any of the possible detection events since they are\nboth inside (or on) the forward light cone with respect to it. The choice of the late\nsetting, however, can be spacelike separated or even inside the forward light cone of\n\n\fEnergy-time entanglement, Elements of Reality, and Local Realism\nA\n\n11\n\nB\nPath difference\nSetting delay\n\nEarly\nsetting\nreadoff\n\n\u03c6\n\nSetting delay\n\nLate\nEarly\ndetection setting\nreadoff\nevent\n\nLate\nt\ndetection\nevent\n\n+1\n\u22121\n\nFigure 4. A: Two settings influence the outcome, one for the early detection, and one\nfor the late detection. The setting delay is the time that it takes for the information to\ntravel from the phase modulator to the detectors, via the light path. B: To ensure the\nevents occur in the order indicated in a), three things can be done: a) making the path\nlength difference large, b) placing the phase modulator late in the analysis station, and\nc) placing the detectors close to the second beamsplitter.\n\nthe (possible) early detection event. To make this possible, one needs to make the path\ndifference of the analysis station longer than the distance from the phase modulator to\nthe detectors. In other words, one needs to make the path difference large, place the\nphase modulator as late as possible in the analysis station and have the detectors close\nto the second beamsplitter (see figure 4B).\nWhen this is the done, the early setting can still be used by a (hypothetical) model to\ndelay the detection. But as soon as a delay has occured the setting cannot cause the delay\nto be undone as this would violate causality. The early detection event would already\nhave taken place when the late-setting choice is made. So while the early coincidences\nonly are bounded by the trivial bound 4 in Theorem 1 applies for the late coincidences.\nWe therefore have the following theorem [4]:\nTheorem 5. A local realist model with long realist delays has the properties \"Realism\"\nand \"Locality\" from Theorem 1, and\nLong realist time delays. The delay is a realist property as in Theorem 3 and is long\nenough to ensure that the setting relevant for the late detection cannot undo the\ndelay.\nThe outcomes from a local realist model with long realist delays obey\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\nE A1 B1 coinc. for A1 and B1 + E A1 B2 coinc. for A1 and B2\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n+ E A2 B1 coinc. for A2 and B1 \u2212 E A2 B2 coinc. for A2 and B2\n\n\u0011\n\n(10)\n\u2264 3.\n\nThe bound in inequality (10) is 3. This stems from the fact that early and late\ncoincidences are equally probable which lets us take the mean value of the trivial bounds\n4 (early coincidences) and 2 (late coincidences). Unfortunately, this is larger than\n\u221a\nthe maximal quantum prediction 2 2. To establish a better bound we need to use\nso-called \"chained\" Bell inequalities [12, 14] with more terms, and this gives the following\ntheorem [4].\n\n\fEnergy-time entanglement, Elements of Reality, and Local Realism\n\n12\n\nTheorem 6.

While the postselection does\nhave an effect on the bound, this case allows quantum mechanics to give a violation;\nchoosing the six directions \u03c0/6 apart in a plane in the order b3 , a1 , b2 , a2 , b1 , a3 , will\nyield the quantum prediction\nD\n\nE\n\nD\n\nA1 B3 coinc. for A1 and B3 + A1 B2 coinc. for A1 and B2\n\nE\n\n+\n\nD\n\nE\n\nD\n\nE\n\n+\n\nD\n\nE\n\nD\n\nE\n\nA2 B2 coinc. for A2 and B2 + A2 B1 coinc. for A2 and B1\nA3 B1 coinc. for A3 and B1 \u2212 A3 B3 coinc. for A3 and B3\n\n(12)\n\n= 6 cos \u03c06 \u2248 5.196,\nThere is no local realist model with setting-independent delays that gives this value\nand we therefore have established a test for the Franson interferometer that is free of the\npostselection loophole. Performing this experiment is however more difficult than the one\nin Theorem 1 since the value in equation (12) is so close to the bound in inequality (11).\nThe visibility needs to be as high as 96.2% which is demanding. By adding even more\nterms to inequality (11) it is possible to slightly decrease this requirement to 94.6%. This\nminima is found when using ten terms, increasing the number of terms even more only\nincreases the critical visibility. Table 1 lists visibility requirements for different number\nof terms.\nWhen only using local realism it becomes easier to argue for device independence\nsince one does not rely on internal properties of the analysis stations. It is, of course,\nstill important to verify that the delays do occur at equal probability, but it is no longer\nneeded to verify the existence of two distinct paths. Similarly as before, an experiment\nmeant to test the inequality needs to ensure that the possible early detection event\nreally is independent of the late phase delay choice. And again, since the experimenters\ndo not know the detection moments in advance, this must be done by switching the\nsettings fast enough to ensure that a new random setting is chosen in-between the early\ndetection event and the late-setting readoff. This is similarly difficult to the corresponding\nrequirement when using path realism (see above), but this is the price to pay for only\nusing EPR elements of reality in the derivation of the bound. One should also note that\nthe early-setting choice and the late-setting choice needs to be independent, which would\nbe achieved with a good source of randomness.

There is no local realist model with realist emission time that\ngives the probabilities predicted by quantum mechanics for the Franson interferometer.\n5. Modified setups\nAnother approach to reach a violation of local realism from the quantum-mechanical\npredictions is to modify the setup. A number of alternatives exist, and we will here\nbriefly go through three of these alternatives.\nThe first modified setup was proposed by Strekalov et al. in 1996 [16] (see figure 5).\nThis setup uses a polarization-entangled source and three polarizing beamsplitters at\neach site. The interference occurs at the third and last polarizing beamsplitter. In this\nsetup, the path taken is an EPR element of reality because a polarization measurement\n(in place of one analysis station) can be used to remotely predict which path the remote\nphoton is going to travel through. But this is not needed; because of the polarization\nentanglement the photon pairs always end up in the same timeslot, giving coincident\ndetection. There is no postselection, and we can in fact use Theorem 1 (modulo other\nexperimental problems). This is good, because the experimental realization proposed\nin [16] does not use separate paths, but instead uses a single birefringent optical element\nat each site to implement the whole analysis station, so an argument based on a realist\npath cannot be used. But as we have seen, local realism can be violated in this setup\neven when the paths coincide.\nThe second alternative, sometimes called \"time-bin entanglement\", uses a source\nproposed in Brendel et al. in 1999 [17] and switched mirrors in place of the first\nbeamsplitters [18]. The source uses a pulsed pump, an unbalanced interferometer, and\n\n\fEnergy-time entanglement, Elements of Reality, and Local Realism\n\n14\n\n\u03c6\n\n\u03c8\n\n45\u25e6\n\n45\u25e6\n\nPol. ent. source\nPBS\n\n+1\n\nPBS\n\nPBS\n\nPBS\n\n\u22121\n\n+1\n\u22121\n\nFigure 5. Using a polarization-entangled source. The time-correlated photons are still\nsent out at unknown moments in time, but are now also polarization-entangled. The\nbeamsplitters used are polarizing beamsplitters (PBS), and the interference occurs at\nthe third PBS at each site, because this is oriented \u03c0/4 in relation to the other two. In\nthis setup there is no postselection, so that Theorem 1 can be used directly, and the\nbound is violated by the quantum prediction.\n\nPulsed pump\n\n\u03c6\n\n\u03c8\nL\n\nE\n\n+1\n\nL\n\nNonlinear crystal\n\nE\n\n\u22121\n\n+1\n\u22121\n\nFigure 6. Time-bin entanglement. The mirrors are synchronized with the source so\nthat photons produced by the early part of the pulse would be delayed in the analysis\nstation, while photons produced by the late part of the pulse would not be delayed. In\nthis setup there is no postselection, so that Theorem 1 can be used directly, and the\nbound is violated by the quantum prediction. If we instead replace the controlled mirrors\nwith passive beamsplitters we have phase-time encoding which gives us Theorem 5.\n\n\u03c6\n\u22121\nSource\n+1\n\u22121\n\n\u03c8\n\n+1\n\nFigure 7. Hugging interferometers. This setup has many of the properties of\nthe original Franson setup. The interferometers are very large and this becomes\nexperimentally challenging. Here, the path taken by each photon is an EPR element\nof reality so that Theorem 1 can be used, and the bound is violated by the quantum\nprediction.\n\n\fEnergy-time entanglement, Elements of Reality, and Local Realism\n\n15\n\na nonlinear device that creates photon pairs. The active mirrors are pushed in and\npulled out of the photon path in sync with the source (see figure 6). In this setup, the\npath taken is also an EPR element of reality, because a measurement of the time of\nemission (in place of one analysis station) can be used to remotely predict which path\nthe remote photon is going to travel through. Again, this is not needed; because of the\nsynchronization of the mirror positions the photon pair is detected in the same timeslot\nand every pair gives coincident detections. There is no postselection, and Theorem 1\n(modulo other experimental problems) can be used to rule out local realist models.\nIt is possible to modify the time-bin-entanglement setup further by using passive\nswitching. Gisin et al. refers to this setup as \"phase-time encoding\" [19]. In this method,\nthe movable mirrors are replaced by beam splitters. We can remove one of the analysis\nstations and measure the emission time from the source, which becomes an EPR element\nof reality. However, in contrast to time-bin-entanglement it is not possible to predict the\npath taken and we get a situation very similar to the Franson interferometer. In fact,\nwith passive switching we recover the weaker Theorem 5 and the only difference to the\nFranson setup is the fact that phase-time encoding uses a pumped source.\nThe third alternative in this list was proposed by Cabello et al. in 2009 [20] and\nuses interferometers in a \"hugging\" configuration as seen in figure 7. In this setup,\npostselection is performed because the two photons both may end up at the same site,\nat both input ports of the beamsplitter at that site but in different timeslots. The\nevents that give coincident detection at both sites make up 50% of the total. But also\nhere the path is an EPR element of reality, because a local path measurement (done\nby removing the final beamsplitter) can be used to remotely predict which path the\nremote photon is going to emerge from. Since the path is an EPR element of reality, we\ncan use Theorem 4 (modulo other experimental problems), and the quantum prediction\nwill violate the bound. There is no local realist model (with realist path) that gives the\nquantum predictions of this setup, and because of this, the hugging interferometer setup\nis sometimes called a setup with \"genuine energy-time entanglement\". Lima et al. [21] and\nCuevas et al. [22] have both demonstrated violations of Bell's inequality using hugging\ninterferometers, the latter was performed with a fibre length of 1 km.\n6. Conclusions\nThis paper has discussed tests of local realism using energy-time entanglement. Even\nthough most of the proposed experiments use postselection, we have seen that certain\ntypes of models can be ruled out. But we have also seen that the tests are subtle,\nbecause depending on the precise requirements made on the local realist model, the same\nexperimental data can imply a) no violation, b) smaller violation than usual, or c) full\nviolation of the appropriate statistical bound.\nUsing only that the measurement outcomes are EPR elements of reality is not\n\n\fEnergy-time entanglement, Elements of Reality, and Local Realism\n\n16\n\nenough to yield a violation [4]: the appropriate Bell inequality would be trivial and reads\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\nE A1 B1 coinc. for A1 and B1 + E A1 B2 coinc. for A1 and B2\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\n+ E A2 B1 coinc. for A2 and B1 \u2212 E A2 B2 coinc. for A2 and B2\n\n\u0011\n\n(13)\n\u2264 4.\n\nAdding that the moment of emission is an EPR element of reality enables a violation,\nalthough a weaker violation than that of the usual Bell setup [4]: there is a violation\nusing the chained equation (12) with six terms while the appropriate four-term Bell\ninequality would read\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\nE A1 B1 coinc. for A1 and B1 + E A1 B2 coinc. for A1 and B2\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\n+ E A2 B1 coinc. for A2 and B1 \u2212 E A2 B2 coinc. for A2 and B2\n\n\u0011\n\n(14)\n\u2264 3.\n\nRequiring that the model also uses a realist path will enable a violation, equally\nlarge as that from a standard Bell test [5, 8]. Note that, in the original Franson setup,\nthe path is not an EPR element of reality; it cannot be predicted without disturbing the\nsystem. But path realism can still be listed as an expected model property, and tested in\nexperiment; one motive for requiring this particle-like behaviour from the model would\nbe correspondence to properties from classical physics. The violation would be equally\nstrong as that of the usual Bell setup: the appropriate Bell inequality has the usual\nbound\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\nE A1 B1 coinc. for A1 and B1 + E A1 B2 coinc. for A1 and B2\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n+ E A2 B1 coinc. for A2 and B1 \u2212 E A2 B2 coinc. for A2 and B2\n\n\u0011\n\n(15)\n\u2264 2.\n\nA final alternative is to modify the setup to ensure that the path taken is an EPR\nelement of reality [16\u201318, 20]. This enables a violation that is equally strong as that of\nthe usual Bell setup: the appropriate Bell inequality is inequality (15).\nThese considerations must also be taken into account in quantum communication.\nFor example, in Bell-inequality based quantum cryptography [23], the inequality is used\nas test of security. The original Bell inequality (bounded by 2) is only available as a\nsecurity test if path realism can be used, and this is only possible when a) there really\nare distinct paths within the analysis stations, and b) the attacker is unable to control\nwhich path the \"photon will take\". This is highly device-dependent; when aiming for\ndevice-independent security, the security test should not rely on the internal structure\nof the analyzing stations. Thus, path realism should not be used. The users must rely\non the black-box formulation obtained when using emission time as an EPR element of\nreality. In this case, the original four-correlation Bell inequality cannot be used as test\nof security (see above), and using the chained inequalities, the security margin will be\nsmaller than from the standard Bell test, since the critical visibility is higher than in\nthis test.\n\n\fREFERENCES\n\n17\n\nEnergy-time entanglement obtained with the Franson interferometer and its variants\nis a subtle way to test local realistic models, with or without added properties. It will\nbe used in many future experiments intended to violate local realism, but in performing\nthem it is important to be aware of exactly what is tested in these experiments, and\nthe size of the violation. Even with the subtleties associated with this interferometer,\nor more correctly, because of these subtleties, the interferometer will continue to be an\nimportant tool to extend our knowledge on the foundations of quantum mechanics.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors would like to thank J.
