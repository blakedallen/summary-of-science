Thus two almost CR geometries (H, J)\nand (H \u2032 , J \u2032 ) are equivalent if and and only if they generate isomorphic induced partially integrable\nCR geometries (H, K) and (H \u2032 , K \u2032 ), and the set of CR morphisms between these spaces contains an\nelement that maps J to J \u2032 . Similar results hold for almost Lagrangian structures.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nCR geometry is a particularly rich mathematical seam, spawning elegant results and successful applications all over the place with joyful abandon. Though partially integrable CR manifolds of hyper-surface\ntype can be sucessfully analysed by constructing a unique normal Cartan connection (see [\u010cap02] and\n[\u010cS00]), the same is not true for general almost CR structures of the same type, where no such constructions exist.\nHowever, this paper details a way of locally matching each 'generic' almost CR structure (H, J), in\na purely algebra\u0131\u0308c fashion, to a uniquely defined partially integrable CR structure (H, K). The data of\n(H, J) can thus be fully captured by the normal Cartan connection for (H, K) and by J. In particular, two\nalmost CR structures are equivalent if and only if they generate isomorphic induced partially integrable\nCR structures (H, K) and (H \u2032 , K \u2032 ), and the set of CR morphisms between these spaces contains an\nelement that maps J to J \u2032 .\nSimilar results hold for Lagrangian geometries, which are another real form of these CR geometries.\nThe construction of K from J requires certain assumptions on the eigenvalues of an automorphism\nA of H, specifically that they all be non-real. This is the 'generic' condition needed for the almost CR\nstructure \u2013 note that the condition is vacuous in the definite signature case, where A has only imaginary\neigenvalues. When the condition does fail, the structure on the manifold can best be described as a mixed\nstructure, intertwining Lagrangian and CR structures.\n\nAcknowledgements\nIt gives me great pleasure to acknowledge the financial support of project P19500-N13 of the \"Fonds zur\nF\u00f6rderung der wissenschaftlichen Forschung (FWF)\".\n\n2\n\nThe CR case\n\nAn almost CR structure of hypersurface type is given by:\n\u2022 a manifold M of dimension 1 + 2n,\n1\n\n\f2. The CR case\n\n\u2022 a distribution H \u2282 T M of rank 2n generating a \"contact\" form \u03c9 \u2208 \u0393(\u22272 H \u2217 \u2297 (T M/H)), which\nmay be degenerate,\n\u2022 an almost-complex structure J on H, such that \u03bd is non-degenerate, where \u03bd is defined as\n\u03bd(X, Y ) =\n\n\u0001\n1\n(\u03c9(X, Y ) + \u03c9(JX, JY ) ,\n2\n\nfor any sections X and Y of H.\nNote that \u03bd is J-hermitian, in that \u03bd(JX, JY ) = \u03bd(X, Y ) for all X, Y \u2208 \u0393(H). It defines a metric g given\nby\ng(X, Y ) = \u03bd(X, JY ).\nThe signature of an almost CR structure is the signature of g. If g is positive definite, then the nondegeneracy of \u03bd implies the non-degeneracy of \u03c9; this is not the case for other signatures.\nDefinition 2.1. A partially integrable CR manifold is one defined as above with \u03bd = \u03c9.\nWe may construct an automorphism A of H as A = g \u22121 \u03c9. Then the core theorem of this paper is:\nTheorem 2.2. If \u03c9 and \u03bd are both non-degenerate, and none of the eigenvalues of A is real, then there\nexists an almost-complex structure K on H, uniquely defined by the data (H, J), such that (H, K) defines\na partially integrable CR manifold.\nIn the definite signature case, all the eigenvalues of A must be pure imaginary, so the restriction on\nA is not needed. It is an open condition that will be satisfied by \"most\" distributions, and certainly\nthose obtained by small deformations of partially integrable CR structures: for in that case A = J, with\neigenvalues \u00b1i.\nSince partially integrable CR structures are defined by a unique normal Cartan connection ([\u010cap02]\nand [\u010cS00]), this has the immediate corollary that:\nCorollary 2.3. Two almost CR structures (H, J) and (H \u2032 , J \u2032 ) are isomorphic if and only if their generated partially integrable CR structures (H, K) and (H \u2032 , K \u2032 ) define isomorphic normal Cartan connections,\nand if there exists a CR morphism between them that pulls back J to J \u2032 .\nThe methods used to prove Theorem 2.2 involve constructing K linearly from J at each point of M .\nThe procedure is easily seen to be continuous, generating a continuous K. Now pick any point x in M ,\nand let V = Hx ; by an abuse of notation, we will drop the indexes and refer to \u03c9x , \u03bdx gx , Ax and Jx as\n\u03c9, \u03bd, g, A and J.\nThe endomorphism space V \u2297 V \u2217 decomposes under the triple (\u03bd, g, J) as\n2\n2\nV \u2297 V \u2217 = su(g, J) \u2295 (\u22271,1\n0 V ) \u2295 (\u2227C V ) \u2295 (\u2299C V ) \u2295 (R * J) \u2295 (R * Id).\n\nRelevant subalgebras of this are the complex algebra sl(V, J) = su(g, J) \u2295 (\u22271,1\n0 V ), the symplectic\nalgebra sp(\u03bd) = su(g, J) \u2295 (\u22992C V ) \u2295 (R * J), the orthogonal algebra so(g) = su(g, J) \u2295 (\u22272C V ) \u2295 (R * J) and\nthe conformal unitary algebra su(g, J) \u2295 (R * J) \u2295 (R * Id). Following the tradition of parabolic geometry\n([\u010cG00], [\u010cG02]), this last algebra will be designated g0 and the corresponding group G0 . It is the largest\ngroup that preserves a given CR structure. Upon constructing K from J, we will see that the definition\nis unique up to G0 action, hence that it defines a unique CR structure.\nNote that so(g) \u2229 gl(V, J) = g0 , hence that SO(g) \u2229 GL(V, J) = G0 . The process for construction K\nflows from:\n\n2\n\n\f2. The CR case\n\nProposition 2.4. For any given collection of non-degenerate \u03c9, J, \u03bd A and g, defined as above with\nA having only non-real eigenvalues, there exists an element e in SO(g) such that \u03c9 is hermitian for the\nalmost-complex structure K = e\u22121 Je. This e is defined up to the left action of G0 ; since G0 preserves J,\nthis defines K uniquely.\nConstructing this e is basic linear algebra. We will be operating in the complexified space VC = V \u2297 C,\nkeeping track of the subspace V = V \u2297 1 via complex conjugation.\nDefinition 2.5. The space D\u03b1k is defined to be the k-th generalised eigenspace for A with eigenvalue \u03b1,\ni.e. the kernel of the linear map (A \u2212 \u03b1Id)k . The Jordan normal form decomposition of A demonstrates\nthat\nVC = \u2295j D\u03b1j ,\n= D\u03b1k j .\nwhere \u03b1j are the eigenvalues of A and D\u03b1j = D\u03b1k k for some k where D\u03b1k+1\nj\nDefinition 2.6. The set S is defined to be the set of eigenvalues of A; since A is non-degenerate, 0 \u2208\n/ S,\nand by assumption, S \u2229 R = \u2205.\nLemma 2.7. The space D\u03b1 is g-orthogonal to all eigenspaces D\u03b2 , except when \u03b2 = \u2212\u03b1. Moreover, g\ngives a non-degenerate pairing between D\u03b1 and D\u2212\u03b1 .\nProof of Lemma. Let u \u2208 D\u03b11 , v \u2208 D\u03b21 . Then since g(Au, v) = \u2212g(Av, u), we must have \u03b1g(u, v) =\n\u2212\u03b2g(u, v). Hence either g(u, v) = 0, or \u03b1 = \u2212\u03b2. Assume for the moment that \u03b1 6= \u2212\u03b2; hence D\u03b11 \u22a5 D\u03b21 .\nReasoning by induction, assume that D\u03b1j \u22a5g D\u03b2k , and let u \u2208 D\u03b1j , v \u2208 D\u03b2k+1 . Then\n\u03b1g(u, v) = g(Au, v) == \u2212g(u, Av) = \u2212g(u, \u03b2v + v k ) = \u2212g(u, \u03b2v).\nHence D\u03b1j \u22a5g D\u03b2k+1 . Since we may induct both j and k, and since the generalised eigenspaces stabilise\nafter finitely many steps, we must have D\u03b1 \u22a5 D\u03b2 .\n\u2217\nand D\u2212\u03b1 \u2283 D\u03b1\u2217 . Dimensional considerations\nConsequently, the pairing under g gives D\u03b1 \u2283 D\u2212\u03b1\nimply that g pairs D\u03b1 and D\u2212\u03b1 in a non-degenerate fashion.\n\u0004\nSince A is real, it commutes with complex conjugation, implying that S = S and that D\u03b1 = D\u03b1 .\nDefine S+ as the set of elements \u03b1 in S such that the argument of \u03b1 is in (0, \u03c0/2]. Then S =\nS+ \u222a S+ \u222a \u2212S+ \u222a \u2212S+ . For any \u03b1 in S+ , define the space\nC\u03b1 = D\u03b1 + D\u03b1 + D\u2212\u03b1 + D\u2212\u03b1 .\nThese C\u03b1 are mutually orthogonal, non-degenerate under g and closed under complex conjugation. This\nmeans that C\u03b1 = C\u03b1R \u2297 C, where C\u03b1R is a real subspace of V . If \u03b1 is not pure imaginary, then C\u03b1R must be\nof split signature (2p, 2p), since D\u03b1 + D\u03b1 must be the complexification of an even dimensional isotropic\nspace, pairing non-degenerately with D\u2212\u03b1 + D\u2212\u03b1 .\nIf \u03b1 is pure imaginary, let v + v be an orthonormal element of C\u03b1R , for v \u2208 D\u03b1 . Then\n||iv \u2212 iv||2\n\n= \u22122g(iv, iv) + g(iv, iv) + g(v, v)\n= 2g(v, v)\n= ||v + v||2 ,\n\nsince v and v are isotropic. Hence C\u03b1R is of signature (2p, 2q).\nLet L\u00b1 be the \u00b1i eigenspace of J. These two spaces must be isotropic with L+ \u2295 L\u2212 = V , by the\nproperties of J. Note that L+ = L\u2212 . By the signature results for C\u03b1R , we have the following lemma:\n\n3\n\n\f3. The Lagrangian case\n\nLemma 2.8. There exists a decomposition of L+ as\nL+ = \u2295\u03b1\u2208S+ P\u03b1 ,\nsuch that the spaces Q\u03b1 = P\u03b1 \u2295P\u03b1 are mutually orthogonal, non-degenerate under g, closed under complex\nconjugation, and of same dimension and signatures as C\u03b1 .\nProof of Lemma. Pick an orthonormal basis in V for the hermitian metric g + i\u03bd, group the basis\nelements together to generate subspaces of the correct signature, and complexify into subspaces of VC .\nSince these spaces are all preserved by J, they give the required splitting of L+ .\n\u0004\nWe now choose a map e on VC , defined in the following way: for \u03b1 not purely imaginary, let P\u03b1 =\nP\u03b11 \u2295P\u03b12 , where P\u03b1j \u2295P\u03b1j is isotropic. Then map D\u03b1 into P\u03b11 in any fashion, map D\u03b1 into P\u03b11 by conjugation,\nD\u2212\u03b1 into P\u03b12 by duality under g, and D\u2212\u03b1 into P\u03b12 by duality then conjugation (or conjugation then duality\n\u2013 g is real, hence commutes with conjugation).\nFor \u03b1 purely imaginary, pick an orthonormal basis vj \u2295 vj of C\u03b1R with vj \u2208 D\u03b1 , an orthonormal basis\nuj \u2295 uj of QR\n\u03b1 for u \u2208 L+ , and map one basis to the other, sending D\u03b1 into P\u03b1 .\nBy construction, e preserves the metric g and complex conjugation; thus it is an element of SO(g).\nLet e\u2032 be another element of SO(g) that maps D\u03b1 to L+ whenever \u03b1 has positive imaginary part; then\ne\u2032 = f e, where f is an element of:\n(GL(L+ ) \u2295 GL(L\u2212 )) \u2229 SO(g).\nBut this intersection is G0 , as the real part of (GL(L+ ) \u2295 GL(L\u2212 )) is just GL(V, J). Thus e is unique up\nto left G0 action. By construction, the endomorphism eAe\u22121 must have eigenspaces that are subspaces\nof L\u00b1 , and hence commute with J. Since e is orthogonal, this implies that e\u22121 * \u03c9 is J-hermitian, where\n(e\u22121 * \u03c9)(X, Y ) = \u03c9(e\u22121 X, e\u22121 Y ).\nLemma 2.9. The form \u03c9 is hermitian under the complex structure K = e\u22121 Je, i.e.\n\u03c9(KX, KY ) = \u03c9(X, Y ),\nand K is invariantly defined independently of the choice of e.\nProof of Lemma. First note that\n\u03c9(KX, KY ) = \u03c9(e\u22121 J(eX), e\u22121 J(eY ))\n= (e\u22121 * \u03c9)(J(eX), J(eY ))\n= (e\u22121 * \u03c9)(eX, eY )\n= \u03c9(e\u22121 (eX), e\u22121 (eY ))\n= \u03c9(X, Y ),\nsince (e\u22121 * \u03c9) is J-hermitian. Now let e\u2032 = f e be another suitable map. Then\n(e\u2032 )\u22121 Je\u2032 = e\u22121 f \u22121 Jf e = e\u22121 Je = K,\nsince f \u2208 G0 preserves J.\n\n3\n\n\u0004\n\nThe Lagrangian case\n\nAlmost Lagrangian structures are given by a distribution H with contact form \u03c9, as above, and by a\ndecomposition\nH = E \u2295 F,\n4\n\n\fREFERENCES\n\n4. Real and imaginary eigenvalues\n\ninto two bundles of equal size. This can be characterise by the existence of a trace-free involution \u03c3\nsquaring to the identity, with E as its +1 eigenspace and F its \u22121 eigenspace. Partial integrability is\ngiven by the relation:\n\u03c9(\u03c3(X), \u03c3(Y )) = \u2212\u03c9(X, Y ),\nequivalent to the isotropy of E and F under \u03c9 (notice the change in sign compared with the CR case).\nThe canonical two-form that we will need is \u03bd, defined by\n\u03bd(X, Y ) =\n\n\u0001\n1\n\u03c9(X, Y ) \u2212 \u03c9(\u03c3(X), \u03c3(Y )) ,\n2\n\nwhile the (split) metric g is\ng(X, Y ) = \u03bd(X, \u03c3(Y )).\nIf \u03c9 and \u03bd are non-degenerate, and the automorphism A = g \u22121 \u03c9 does not have any purely imaginary\neigenvalues, then the proof proceed as in the CR case (except that now D\u03b1 \u2295 D\u03b1 will be mapped into\nL+ , rather than D\u03b1 \u2295 D\u2212\u03b1 as was the case then; note also that L\u00b1 = L\u00b1 , L+ = E \u2297 C and L\u2212 = F \u2297 C).\n\n4\n\nReal and imaginary eigenvalues\n\nIf A in the CR case has a real eigenvalue, the above procedure does not work. Since a g-skew automorphism\nwith real eigenvalues can be approximated arbitrarily closely by those with complex eigenvalues, it must\nstill remain the case that D\u03b1 is even-dimensional, and that C\u03b1 = D\u03b1 \u2295 D\u2212\u03b1 is of split signature (2p, 2p).\nThe only obstruction to choosing e as above is that e cannot now be chosen to lie inside SO(g), but only\nin its complexification SO(g, C) (uniqueness of the definition of e is preserved by assigning D\u03b1 to L+\nwhen \u03b1 > 0). However, a different approach can bear fruit.\nDefine MA to be the subset of M where A has real eigenvalues. It must be closed, implying that\nM c = M \u2212 MA is open, hence that M c is a submanifold of M . On M c , we have a unique choice of K, but\nthis choice cannot necessarily be extended continuously across MA . If MA has empty interior, and does\nnot separate M into components, then the degeneracy on MA does not matter much: the equivalence\nproblem for (H, J) can be analysed away from MA , and extended to MA by continuity. Even if M\ndoes get separated in to components, the equivalence problem can still be analysed on each component\nseparately, and the resulting limits \"glued together\".\nIf MA does have a non-empty interior, then the natural structure on it is an intertwined structure: a\ndecomposition of H into isotropic H1 \u2295 H2 , such that there exists a J on 1 and a \u03c3 on H2 with \u03c9|\u22272 H1\nbeing J-hermitian, and \u03c9|\u22272 H2 being \u03c3-Lagrangian. On any connected subset of MA where the rank of\nthe generalised eigenspaces for real eigenvalues is constant, such a structure can be defined. Since that\nrank is upper semi continous, and bounded above by 2n, this allows us to partition MA into components\nwhere such structures are defined, excluding only sets of small dimension.\nOf course, the converse results hold for almost Lagrangian structures with an A with pure imaginary\neigenvalues.\n\nReferences\n[\u010cap02] Andreas \u010cap.
