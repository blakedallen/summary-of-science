Lyngby, Denmark\nE-mail: antti@mic.dtu.dk\nA generalized Landauer formula, derived with the methods due to Keldysh, and Baym and\nKadanoff, is gaining widespread use in the modeling of transport in a large number of different\nmesoscopic systems. We review some of the recent developments, including transport in semiconductor superlattices, calculation of noise, and nanoelectromechanical systems.\n\nI.\nA.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nSome background, and a few historical remarks\n\nA mesoscopic transport measurement is often concerned with a situation where the \"device\", whose properties are\nthe subject of the investigation, is connected to structureless \"contacts\" via \"ideal leads\", i.e., in a situation which is\naccessible via the Landauer formula (or, more generally, the scattering approach to transport). An important feature\nis the fact that the size of the device is finite, and comparable to other important length-scales of the system, such as\nthe phase-braking length or impurity mean free path. Thus the wave-properties of the charge carriers are important,\nleading to a number of interesting interference effects, such as weak localization, or universal conductance fluctuations.\nThe conductance g of the device, for example, is then given by the celebrated Landauer formula[1, 2]\ng=\n\n2e2 2\n|t| ,\n~\n\n(1)\n\nwhere t is the quantum mechanical transmission amplitude through the device.\nThe expression given above holds for the one-channel case, for low applied voltages, and in a situation when the\n\"device\" can be modelled by a noninteracting system. It is then natural to ask: Can this equation be generalized\nto the case, when interactions are important? Or: Can this equation be extended to time-dependent situations, or\nsituations where superconductivity or magnetism are essential for the physics? How about strong driving fields?\nMany authors have addressed these questions, with a number of different approaches. In the spirit of this conference,\nthis review is concerned with the subset of these theories which use the nonequilibrium Green function technique.\nThe earliest applications to mesoscopic transport, to my knowledge, are due to French researchers[3, 4, 5, 6]: these\nresearchers were mainly interested in inelastic effects in tunneling through oxide barriers. It is a curious side-note\nto observe that these early, and pioneering, papers were essentially forgotten during the 80's, but have obtained a\nsubstantial revival since mid-90's, and are presently cited more often than ever earlier. The explanation lies perhaps\nin the fact that the whole idea of mesoscopics is newer than these early papers, and it took the mesoscopic community\na few years to realize the applicability of these ideas.\nFor the purposes of the present review, the next important development was the paper by Meir and Wingreen[7],\nwhich gave a very useful formal expression for the current in terms of the exact Green function of the device (or\n\"central region\"). This formula, and similar expressions obtained by other groups, were then applied to the Kondo\nproblem out of equilibrium, a notoriously difficult problem, which remains a topic of active research even today. My\nprevious review[8] in the first meeting of the present series focused in some of these issues, paying particular attention\nto the time-dependent generalization of the Meir-Wingreen expression[9]. I shall not repeat any of that material,\nbut rather focus on other topics: the selection criterion has been that either they were not discussed during the\nfirst meeting, or that they are strictly post-1999 vintage. I have chosen to discuss three examples: (i) Transport\nin a semiconductor superlattice; (ii) Calculation of the noise in a spintronic system; and (iii) Tunneling transport\nin a nanoelectromechanical (NEMS) device. These three topics have a common feature: they all have practical\napplications, and, dare I say in the present meeting, even commercial potential.\nIt should be noted that there are many other recent applications of the NGF to mesoscopic transport which, due\nto space and time limitations, the present review does not address. One such example is transport in nanowires,\n\n\u2217\n\nBased on a talk presented at the conference \"Progress in Nonequilibrium Green Functions, Dresden, Germany, 19.-22. August 2002\"\n\n\f2\nfabricated either with scanning tunnelling microscope, or with break junctions, which is a large research field where\nmany theoretical calculations emply the NGF techniques. An exhaustive review has recently become available[10].\nMolecular electronics holds enormous potential, and here a combination of ab initio electronic structure calculations\n(within the density-functional scheme) and NGF appears to the most promising theoretical technique[11, 12]. Yet\nanother example is the \"circuit theory\" developed by Nazarov[13, 14], which has successfully been applied to a number\nof hybrid structures, consisting of superconductors, ferromagnets, or semiconductors. The more abstract field-theoretic\nformulations, based on path-integrals and/or Grassmann variables fall also outside our present purposes, even though\nthey play an important role in the study of disordered systems, or dephasing due to the environment.\nB.\n\nThe basic equations, and their limitations\n\nFor completeness, we sketch here a derivation of the basic expressions used in the theory. Several more complete\naccounts are available elsewhere[8, 9, 15]. A brief reminder of how the nonequilibrium formalism works in the\ncontext of mesoscopic transport measurements is also in place. One reasons as follows. In the remote past the\ncontacts and the central region (i.e., the \"device\") are assumed to be decoupled, and each region is in thermal\nequilibrium. The equilibrium distribution functions for the three regions are characterized by their respective chemical\npotentials; these do not have to coincide nor are the differences between the chemical potentials necessarily small. The\ncouplings between the different regions are then established and treated as perturbations via the standard techniques\nof perturbation theory. The nonequilibrium nature of the problem manifests itself in that symmetry of remote past\nand remote future has been broken, and thus one must do the calculations on the two-branch time contour. It is\nimportant to notice that the couplings do not have to be small, e.g., with respect level to spacings or kB T , and\ntypically must be treated to all orders.\nLet us next consider some generic Hamiltonians: H = HL + HR + HT + Hcen , or, explicitly:\nX\n\u01ebk,\u03b1 c\u2020k,\u03b1 ck,\u03b1\nH =\nk,\u03b1\u2208L/R\n\n+\n\nX\n\nk,\u03b1\u2208L/R;n\n\nh\ni\n\u0002\n\u0003\nVk\u03b1;n c\u2020k,\u03b1 dn + h.c. + Hcen {dn }, {d\u2020n } ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the central part Hamiltonian must be chosen according to the system under consideration. The operators\n{dn }, {d\u2020n } refer to a complete set of single-particle states of the central region. Occasionally we specify explicitly\nthe orbital and spin quantum numbers: n = m, \u03c3, and analogously for the states in the leads. The derivation of the\nbasic formula for the current does not require\nPan explicit form for Hcen ; the actual evaluation of the formula of course\nrequires this information. We write Hcen = n \u01ebn d\u2020n dn + Hint , where Hint could be electron-phonon interaction,\nel\u2212ph\nHint\n=\n\nX\n\nd\u2020m,\u03c3 dm,\u03c3\n\nm\u03c3\n\nX\nq\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\nMm,q a\u2020q + aq ,\n\n(3)\n\nor an Anderson impurity:\nA\nHint\n=U\n\nX\n\nd\u2020m,\u2191 dm,\u2191 d\u2020m,\u2193 dm,\u2193 .\n\n(4)\n\nm\n\nThe current operator for the (say) left lead is\nie\nIL = \u2212e\u1e44L = \u2212 [H, NL ]\n~\ni\nie X h\n\u2217\n= \u2212\n\u2212VkL;n c\u2020kL dn + VkL;n\nd\u2020n ckL .\n~\n\n(5)\n\nk,n\n\nThe physically relevant observables can be expressed in terms of expectation values of the current operator, or its\nhigher powers. For example, one can show[9, 15] that the current leaving the left contact is\nt\n\nn\nd\u01eb\nImTr e\u2212i\u01eb(t1 \u2212t) \u0393L (\u01eb, t1 , t)\n2\u03c0\n\u2212\u221e\n\u0002 <\n\u0003o\n.\n\u00d7 G (t, t1 ) + fL0 (\u01eb)Gr (t, t1 )\n\n2e\nhIL i = JL (t) = \u2212\n~\n\nZ\n\ndt1\n\nZ\n\n(6)\n\n\f3\nHere the Green functions are defined by\n\u2020\nG<\nnm (t, t1 ) = ihdm (t1 )dn (t)i\nGrnm (t, t1 ) = \u2212i\u03b8(t \u2212 t1 )h[dn (t), d\u2020m (t1 )]i ,\n\n(7)\n(8)\n\n\u0393mn describes the coupling between the central region and the contacts, and fL0 (\u01eb) is the equilibrium distribution\nfunction of the left contact. In the dc-limit, (6) reduces to the result of Meir and Wingreen[7]:\nZ\n\u0003\nd\u01eb n \u0002 L\nie\nTr \u0393 (\u01eb) \u2212 \u0393R (\u01eb) G< (\u01eb)\nJ =\n2~\n2\u03c0\no\n\u0002 0\n\u0003\n+ fL (\u01eb)\u0393L (\u01eb) \u2212 fR0 (\u01eb)\u0393R (\u01eb) [Gr (\u01eb) \u2212 Ga (\u01eb)]\n(9)\nZ\nie\nd\u03b5\n=\n[fL (\u03b5) \u2212 fR (\u03b5)] T (\u03b5) ,\n(10)\n~\n2\u03c0\nwhere\nT (\u03b5) = Tr\n\n\u001a\n\n\u0003\n\u0393L (\u03b5)\u0393R (\u03b5) \u0002 r\nG (\u03b5) \u2212 Ga (\u03b5)\nL\nR\n\u0393 (\u03b5) + \u0393 (\u03b5)\n\n\u001b\n\n.\n\n(11)\n\nThe expressions (6) and (10) are the central formal results whose consequences we explore in this review.[53] They are\nformally exact, and give the tunneling current for an interacting system coupled to noninteracting contacts (or, more\nprecisely, for contacts which can be described by an effective single-body Hamiltonian). Thus, in a time-dependent\nsituation the displacement current must be considered separately. It should also be noted that these equations only\ndefine the starting point of any calculation: to get into physical results one must evaluate the correlation function\nand the retarded/advanced Green function, Eqs.(7) and (8), respectively. These functions obey the Keldysh equation,\nand the (nonequilibrium) Dyson equation:\nG< = Gr \u03a3< Ga ,\nGr = Gr0 + Gr0 \u03a3r Gr .\n\n(12)\n(13)\n\nThe success of the theory depends on whether one can construct a self-energy functional that captures the essential\nphysics, and that a good solution can be found for these coupled equations. Both of these steps may be hard indeed.\nII.\n\nTRANSPORT IN A SEMICONDUCTOR SUPERLATTICE\n\nIn 1970 Esaki and Tsu[16] suggested that semiconductor superlattices, man-made structures which consist of alternating layers of different semiconductor materials, would have physical properties which could be used for a number\nof device applications. Very shortly, the spatial variations in the band-gaps will lead to a spatially varying conduction band edge, which supports minibands, which in turn diplay very interesting transport properties, such as Bloch\noscillations, or negative differential resistance. A well known-result is the Esaki-Tsu IV-characteristic,\nI(V ) = 2Imax V0\n\nV\n,\nV 2 + V02\n\n(14)\n\nwhere Imax and V0 depend on the physical paratmeres of the system, such as the superlattice period, scattering\nrate, and temperature. To derive expressions like this, three main approaches have been used in the literature:\n(i) Miniband transport[16], (ii) Wannier-Stark hopping[17], and (iii) sequential tunneling[18]. The three different\napproaches have different domains of validity, and are all likely to fail if the three basic energy scales, i.e. scattering\ninduced broadening, miniband width, and potential drop per period all have comparable values. The basic features\nof these three approaches are summarized in Figure 1.\nIn order to map out the boundaries of the various domains of validity, and to access the region where the approaches\n(i)\u2013(iii) fail, a higher level theory is required. To achieve this, Andreas Wacker and myself, together with several\ncolleagues, launched a program whose task was to develop a nonequilibrium Green function theory for superlattice\ntransport.[54] Certain aspects of this program are now completed[22, 23], and in what follows I will review some of\nthe highlights. It should be noted that the literature on superlattice transport is vast and here I can give only a\n\n\f4\nTABLE I: The three standard approaches to miniband transport, and the physical picture underlying them.(Courtesy of A.\nWacker.)\ncoupling T1 field drop eF d scattering \u0393\nMiniband conduction\nexact\nminiband\n\nacceleration\n\ngolden rule\n\nexact: Wannier Stark states\n\ngolden rule\n\nWannier Stark\nhopping\n\nSequential tunneling\nlowest order\n\nenergy\nmismatch\n\n\"exact\"\nspectral\nfunction\n\nvery superficial discussion; the reader is referred to two recent review articles where a much fuller account can be\nfound[24, 25].\nLet me start with a few disclaimers. The quantum theory has not yet been fully developed to the case when the\nelectric field is inhomogeneous (domain formation), nor is it available for the time-dependent case (photo-assisted\ntransport; progress is however being made see, e.g., Appendix C in the review by Wacker[24]). For these important\nsituations one has to apply one of the simpler approaches discussed above. As far scattering is concerned, impurity\nscattering and phonon scattering have been discussed, but carrier-carrier interaction is still a future task.\nThe task is now to solve the coupled Keldysh and Dyson equations, Eq.(12\u201313). We adopt the tight-binding\nrepresentation of the single-particle Hamiltonian:\nHn,m = (\u03b4nm\u22121 + \u03b4n,m+1 )T1 + \u03b4n,m (Ek \u2212 neF d),\n\n(15)\n\nwhere T1 is the nearest neighbor coupling, Ek = ~2 k 2 /(2m) the kinetic energy perpendicular to the growth direction,\nF the applied field, and d the superlattice period. In this basis the Keldysh and Dyson equations (12\u201313) read\n\u0012\n\u0013\nX\nm1 \u2212 n\nr\nG\nG<\n(E)\n=\nE\n+\neF\nd\nmm1\nmn\n2\nm1\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0012\nm+n\n<\n\u00d7 \u03a3m1 E + eF d m1 \u2212\n2\n\u0012\n\u0013\nm\n\u2212\nm\n1\n\u00d7 Gam1 n E + eF d\n(16)\n2\n\u0013\n\u0012\nm\u2212n\nr\nE + eF d\nGrmn (E) = gm\n2\n\"\n\u0012\n\u0013\nX\nl\u2212n\nr\n\u00d7 \u03b4mn +\n\u03a3ml E + eF d\n2\nl\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\nl\u2212m\n\u00d7 Grln E + eF d\n.\n(17)\n2\nNext one needs to specify the self-energies. We have considered[22, 23] impurity scattering, optical phonon scattering, and mimicked acoustic phonon scattering by a very low-energy optical phonon, all in the self-consistent Born\n\n\f5\n\nT1\n2\u0393\n\nMiniband\nconduction\nWannierStark\nHopping\n\n\u0393\n\n0\n\nsequential Tunneling\n\u0393\n2\u0393\n\n0\n\neFd\n\nFIG. 1: The range of validity of various approaches to superlattice transport, in the parameter space spanned by the nearestneighbor coupling T1 , and the potential energy drop edF per period, in units of the scattering width \u0393.\n\n\u2206=20.3 meV\n\nT=77 K\n\nvdrift [cm/s]\n\n10 6\n\n10 5\n\nNGF with phonons\nMC-simulation of BTE\n\n10 -4\n\n10 -3\neFd [eV]\n\n10 -2\n\n10 -1\n\nFIG. 2: Drift velocity vs. applied field.\n\napproximation. By numerically solving these coupled equations, computing the current, and comparing to the corresponding IV-curves found by the simpler approaches (i)\u2013(iii), we can construct a \"phase-diagram\" (see Figure 2),\nwhich indicates where the simpler approaches hold, and where a quantum approach is necessary.\nWe have also compared the quantum mechanical drift\u2013velocity vs. field relation to the results obtained with a\nsemiclassical Monte Carlo simulation. This is quite interesting because the two methods are totally different, and\nboth require computationally rather intensive calculations. Typical results are shown in Figure 3. For the parameters\nconsidered here, the Monte Carlo simulation gives very good results, except that it misses the weak phonon replica\nseen in the quantum calculation.\nThe approach sketched here is ideally suited to transport phenomena where quantum phenomena, such as resonant\ntunneling, or phonon-assisted tunneling, play an important role. Another application concerns quantum cascade\nlasers[26], where the current injection occurs through a \"funnel\": the superlattice is designed so that the miniband\nwidth varies with distance. Another recent calculation concerns the evaluation of gain in such structures[27].\nIII.\n\nNOISE IN SPINTRONICS\n\nThe emerging field of spintronics[28, 29, 30], where, in addition to the charge, also the electron spin is used to design\nnew devices, has led to fascinating and novel ideas such as spin filters[31, 32, 33], spin field-effect transistors[34], and\n\n\f6\nproposals for solid state quantum computing[35]. For example, quantum dot systems can in principle be used to\ncontrol the electron spin and are thus suitable for creating quantum bits relevant for quantum gate operations[36].\nA detailed theoretical study of nonequilibrium transport properties of spintronic devices is necessary in order to\nunderstand the basic physical phenomena and to predict new functionalities. Calculation of the current, for example,\ncan give the conductance/resistance of a system and its dependence on magnetic field, Coulomb interaction, spin-flip\nand so on. On the other hand, current fluctuations, due to the granularity of the charge (shot noise[37]), are also\nrelevant because their measurements can provide additional information not contained in the average current[38].\nHere we illustrate how the nonequilibrium Green function technique can be used to calculate current and its\nfluctuations (noise)[55] in a quantum dot coupled to two ferromagnetic leads as a function of the applied voltage for\nparallel (P) and antiparallel (AP) lead-polarization alignments. We include Coulomb interaction in the Hartree-Fock\napproximation as well as spin-flip in the dot. We show that spin-flip makes the alignment of the lead polarizations\nless important; both P and AP results coincide for large enough spin-flip rates. This fact gives rise to a reduction of\nboth Fano factor[56] and tunnelling magnetoresistance (TMR) as we show below.\nWe model the central region with the Hamiltonian\nX\nHD =\n\u01eb0 d\u2020\u03c3 d\u03c3 + U n\u2191 n\u2193 + R(d\u2020\u2191 d\u2193 + d\u2020\u2193 d\u2191 ),\n(18)\n\u03c3\n\nwhere d\u03c3 (d\u2020\u03c3 ) destroys (creates) an electron in the dot with spin \u03c3 and the energy \u01eb0 is spin independent[43, 44].\nIn addition, we assume that the dot is a small enough in order to have only one active level \u01eb0 . In the presence of\na voltage the level shifts by \u01eb0 = \u01ebd \u2212 eV\n2 , where \u01ebd is the dot level for zero bias. In a more realistic calculation\none should determine the bias dependence self-consistently. The spin-flip scattering amplitude R is viewed here as a\nphenomenological parameter. The spin-flip process lifts the degeneracy, splitting the quantum dot level to two states,\nlet us call them \u01eb1,2 , with corresponding operators. The current is readily evaluated with the formulas given in Section\n1.2 with the result\nZ\n2e\nJL = Re dt2 Tr{Gr (t, t2 )\u03a3L< (t2 , t) + G< (t, t2 )\u03a3La (t2 , t)},\n(19)\n~\n\u2020\nr\nwhere Gr and G< are the nonequilibrium dot Green functions, with elements G<\nij (t, t2 ) = ihdj (t2 )di (t)i and Gij (t, t2 ) =\n\u2020\n\u2212i\u03b8(t \u2212 t2 )h{di (t), dj (t2 )}i. The lesser (retarded, advanced) tunnelling self-energy is given by\n\n\u03a3L<(r,a)\n\n(t2 , t) =\n\n1X 2\n|tkL |\n2\n\n(20)\n\nk\n\n\u00d7\n\n!\n<(r,a)\n<(r,a)\n<(r,a)\n<(r,a)\ngkL\u2191 (t2 , t) + gkL\u2193 (t2 , t) gkL\u2191 (t2 , t) \u2212 gkL\u2193 (t2 , t)\n,\n<(r,a)\n<(r,a)\n<(r,a)\n<(r,a)\ngkL\u2191 (t2 , t) \u2212 gkL\u2193 (t2 , t) gkL\u2191 (t2 , t) + gkL\u2193 (t2 , t)\n\n<(r,a)\n\nwhere gkL\u03c3 is the lesser (retarded, advanced) uncoupled Green function for lead L. Equation (20) leads to a\ngeneralization of the coupling \u0393 found in Section 1.2 above; the coupling matrix now becomes\n\u0013\n\u0012\nL\nL\nL\n1 \u0393L\n\u2191 + \u0393\u2193 \u0393\u2191 \u2212 \u0393\u2193\n\u0393L =\n(21)\nL\nL\nL .\n2 \u0393L\n\u2191 \u2212 \u0393\u2193 \u0393\u2191 + \u0393\u2193\nAccounting for Coulomb interaction in the Hartree-Fock approximation, we can write down a matrix Dyson equation\nfor the retarded Green function, Gr = G0r + G0r \u03a3r Gr , and a Keldysh equation for the lesser Green function\nG< = Gr \u03a3< Ga , where G0r is the uncoupled dot Green function. In these equations the self energies are the sum of\nthe left and right self energies, i.e., \u03a3(r,<) = \u03a3L(r,<) + \u03a3R(r,<) . A self-consistent\ncalculation is required to calculate\nR\n<\nhni i and hd\u2020i di i, which are given by the lesser Green function, hd\u2020j di i = d\u03c9\nImG\nij (\u03c9).\n2\u03c0\nThe current operator can be written as its average value plus some fluctuation, i.e., I\u03b7 = J\u03b7 + \u03b4I\u03b7 (here \u03b7 = L/R\nlabels the contacts). In our system there are two sources of noise, namely, thermal noise and shot noise. The first\none is due to thermal fluctuations in the occupations of the leads. It vanishes for zero temperature, but can be\nfinite for T 6= 0 and eV = 0. On the other hand, shot noise is due to the granularity of the electron charge; it is a\nnonequilibrium property of the system in the sense that it is nonzero only when there is a finite current (eV 6= 0).\nTo calculate the noise (thermal+shot noise) we use the definition S\u03b7\u03b7\u2032 (t \u2212 t\u2032 ) = h{\u03b4I\u03b7 (t), \u03b4I\u03b7\u2032 (t\u2032 )}i, which can also be\nwritten as S\u03b7\u03b7\u2032 (t \u2212 t\u2032 ) = h{I\u03b7 (t), I\u03b7\u2032 (t\u2032 )}i \u2212 2J\u03b72 . After a lengthy but straightforward calculation[45], we find for the\nnoise power spectrum (dc limit; a scalar version of this equation has been found earlier[42])\n\n\f7\n\nS\u03b7\u03b7\u2032 (0) =\n\ne2\n~\n\nZ\n\n\u2032\nd\u03c9\n{\u03b4\u03b7\u03b7\u2032 in\u03b7 \u0393\u03b7 G> \u2212 \u03b4\u03b7\u03b7\u2032 i(1 \u2212 n\u03b7 )\u0393\u03b7 G< + G< \u0393\u03b7 G> \u0393\u03b7\n2\u03c0\n\u2032\n\n\u2212 n\u03b7 (1 \u2212 n\u03b7\u2032 )Gr \u0393\u03b7 Gr \u0393\u03b7 \u2212 n\u03b7\u2032 (1 \u2212 n\u03b7 )Ga \u0393\u03b7 Ga \u0393\u03b7\n\u2212 G< \u0393\u03b7 [(1 \u2212 n\u03b7\u2032 )Gr \u2212 (1 \u2212 n\u03b7 )Ga ]\u0393\u03b7\n\n\u2032\n\n(22)\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n+ (n\u03b7 Gr \u2212 n\u03b7\u2032 Ga )\u0393\u03b7 G> \u0393\u03b7 }.\nThe dc noise (zero frequency) is position independent, and it is possible to show that SLL (0) = SRR (0) = \u2212SLR (0) =\n\u2212SRL (0)[37]. In our numerics we make a few simplifying assumptions. We assume that the couplings \u0393\u03b7 are energy\nindependent, but allow a polarization dependence. For the physical parameters we use accepted values from the current\nliterature[43]. Our Hartree-Fock approximation for the electron-electron interaction does not include correlations of\nthe Kondo type, however we do not expect these to change our results in the present range of parameters.\n\n0.01\n\n(a)\n0.008\n\nI/(2\u03c0eU/h)\n\nP\n0.006\n\nAP\n0.004\n\nR=0\nR=0.1 (AP)\n\n0.002\n\n0\n0.01\n\n(b)\n\n2\n\nS(0)/(2\u03c0e U/h)\n\n0.008\n\nP\nAP\n\n0.006\n1\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n\n0.004\n\n0.002\n\nFano factor\n\nAP\nP\n\n0\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n2\n\n3\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n4\n\n5\n\neV/U\nFIG. 3: Current and noise as a function of the bias for parallel (P) and antiparallel (AP) alignments and with R = 0 and 0.1U .\nThe curves for R = 0.1U are only for the AP alignment; observe that these are almost on top of the P curves, except within\nthe sloping region around U and 3U . Both current and noise are reduced when the right lead changes its polarization from P\nto AP, following the typical behavior of TMR. The inset shows a suppression of the AP-Fano factor due to spin-flip.\n\nFigure 4 shows current (a) and noise (b) as a function of the bias with R = 0 (solid line) and R = 0.1U (dotted line)\nfor both P and AP configurations. Because P and AP curves for R = 0.1U coincide, we plotted only the AP case. The\nfirst enhancement of the current and noise at eV = U happens when \u01eb0 crosses the left chemical potential, allowing\nelectrons to tunnel from the emitter (left lead) to the dot and then to the collector (right lead). The current and noise\n\n\f8\nremain constant until the second level \u01eb0 + U reaches \u03bcL at eV = 3U , when another enhancement is observed. Each\nenhancement corresponds to a peak in the differential conductance \u03c3diff . When the system changes from parallel (P)\nto antiparallel (AP) configurations the current is reduced. This is a typical behavior of tunnelling magnetoresistance\n(TMR). The noise is also affected by this resistance variation, showing a similar reduction.\nLooking at the effects of spin-flip on current and noise we see that the AP curves with R = 0.1U (dotted lines) tend\nto lie on the P curves with R = 0, thus showing that lead alignments are less important when spin-flip plays a part.\nThis AP current enhancement due to spin-flip gives rise to a reduction of the TMR; since TMR = (IP \u2212 IAP )/IAP ,\nwhen IAP \u2192 IP we have TMR \u2192 0. For a somewhat simpler model W. Rudzi\u0144ski et al.[43] found a similar behavior.\nIV.\n\nNANOELECTROMECHANICAL SYSTEMS\n\nMicroelectromechanical systems (MEMS) are today an important part of our technology. Their functionality is\nbased on combining mechanical and electronic degrees of freedom, the great advantage being that the whole device can\nbe fabricated with standard Si-processing technology. Typical applications include hearing aids, sensors, or actuators.\nAs the fabrication technology gets refined, we soon expect to find systems where the mechanical parts are in the\nnanometer range, see the review by Craighead[47]; hence the acronym NEMS. An example is the nanomechanical\nelectron shuttle constructed by Erbe et al.[48] (see Figure 5), based on the theoretical ideas of Gorelik et al..[49]\nTransport through the device was modelled with rate-equations[48], however these are not expected to work when one\n\nFIG. 4: The nanomechanical electron shuttle. An ac-voltage coupled to the gates G1 and G2 causes the central electrode, the\n\"clapper\", C to oscillate, and charges tunnel from the source S to the island, and from the island to the drain D.\n\nenters the coherent transport regime, at lower temperatures and smaller devices, and a quantum theory of transport\nmust be invoked. Such an approach has recently been formulated by Fedorets et al.[50], and I'll give a brief introduction\nto this topic.\nThe archetypal NEMS device consists of a moving part, and electrodes. We shall model the moving part by\na quantum well, whose coupling to the electrodes are position dependent: the tunnelling amplitude is written as\nTL/R (x(t)) = \u03c4L/R exp[\u2213x(t)/\u03bb], where \u03bb is some characteristic tunnelling length, and x(t) is the center-of-mass coordinate of the moving quantum dot. The electronic degrees of freedom are governed by exactly the same Hamiltonians\nas discussed in Section 2; now the dot-level depends on the dot's location via \u01ebd = \u01eb0 \u2212 Ex(t), where E is the electric\nfield, which depends on the applied bias.[57] The center-of-mass of the dot obeys Newton's equation of motion,\n\u1e8d + \u03c902 x = F (x)/M ,\n\n(23)\n\nwhere M is the mass of the grain, \u03c902 = k/M is the characteristic frequency, and F is the force, which includes both\nthe electric force acting on the charge(s) on the dot, and an exchange force, which arises due to the x-dependence of\nthe tunnelling matrix elements. One can evaluate the force via F = \u2212h\u2202H/\u2202xi, and the result is\nX\nF (t) = \u2212iEG< (t, t) + 2/\u03bb\n(\u22121)\u03b1 T\u03b1 (t)Im[G<\n(24)\n\u03b1,k (t, t)],\n\u03b1,k\n\nusing the notation of Section 2. The problem is thus (again) reduced to the determination of the two lesser Green\n\u2020\nfunction: G< for the dot, and the non-diagonal G<\n\u03b1,k = ihck,\u03b1 d(t)i. Fedorets et al.[50] calculate these for a noninteracting system, and proceed to present an analysis of the mechanical stability of the system: does the dot execute\n\n\f9\nregular oscillations (whose frequencies are determined by an appropriate linearization of (23) and (24), or does it\nperhaps become unstable, as the bias is increased? The details of the analysis are not our concern here; the upshot is\nthat above a certain threshold value an instability results. The analysis has also bearing on a recent experiment[51],\nwhere vibronic anomalies were observed in a single-C60 -transistor when current was passed through it.\nThe analysis of Fedorets et al.[50] is very interesting and suggests for several further refinements. For example,\nwhat are the results for an interacting system (Coulomb blockade)? How about the environmental degrees of freedom?\nThis issue was addressed recently Armour and MacKinnon[52], in a slightly different context. Finally, is it possible to\ncombine the spintronic effects with charge shuttles? Can one envisage a spin shuttle? Will there be a new technology\ncalled NEMSS (nanoelectromechanical spin systems)?\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nI have reviewed some of the post-1999 developments in applying NGF to modelling of transport in mesoscopic\nsystems. The common theme in my review has been to focus on \"real devices\", which may have \"real applications\".\nI find it very pleasing that the NGF technique, often regarded as an academic exercise most suited for theoretical\ngames, is now becoming a strong tool in the analysis of practical devices. This trend is also confirmed by several other\ntalks at this conference. At the same time there is still much room for theoretical refinements, and I'm convinced\nthat in the coming years we will witness significant progress in this field, both abstract and practical.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe author is grateful to acknowledge fruitful collaborations with A.
