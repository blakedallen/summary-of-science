Klochkov\n\n1. Introduction\nThe persistent accreting pulsar Hercules X-1 was one of the first X-ray sources discovered by\nthe Uhuru satellite in 1972 (Tananbaum et al. 1972; Giacconi et al. 1973) and since then it remains\none of the most intensively studied X-ray pulsars. The mass of the optical companion is \u223c2M\u2299\nwhich places the system in the middle between high and low mass X-ray binaries. Other main\nparameters of the binary system are the following: orbital period Porb \u2243 1.7 days, spin period of the\nneutron star Pspin \u2243 1.24 sec, X-ray luminosity of the source LX \u223c 2 \u00d7 1037 erg s\u22121 for a distance of\n\u223c7 kpc (Reynolds et al. 1997). The binary orbit is almost circular (Staubert et al. 2009) and has an\ninclination i \u223c 85 \u2212 88\u25e6 (Gerend & Boynton 1976).\nLike many other X-ray pulsars Her X-1 exhibits significant variation of the pulsation period.\nAlternation of spin-up and spin-down episodes on time-scales of several months in this system is\nsuperimposed on a background of systematic spin-up (e.g. Staubert et al. 2006; Klochkov 2007).\nThe behavior of the pulsar's spin period on shorter time scales is not very well studied because such\na study would require a continuous monitoring of Her X-1 with a sensitive X-ray detector. Only\nbetween 1991 and 2000 the BATSE instrument onboard CGRO provided the information about the\nsource's pulse period on a regular basis.\nIn this work we present a continuous monitoring of the Her X-1 pulse period P and its local\n(measured at the time of the observation) time derivative \u1e56 using the Swift/BAT instrument starting\nfrom 2005 (begin of scientific operation) to 2009. The data of the monitoring allowed us to explore\nfor the first time the correlation between the locally measured \u1e56 and the X-ray flux of the pulsar\nand compare the results with predictions of the accretion theory. The observed strong spin-down\nepisodes are discussed in the frame of a model assuming ejection of matter from the inner part of\nthe accretion disk along the open magnetic field lines.\n\n2. Observations and data analysis\nFor our analysis we used the public archival data obtained with the Burst Alert Telescope\n(BAT, 150\u2013150 keV, Barthelmy et al. 2005) onboard the Swift observatory (Gehrels et al. 2004).\nWith its large field of view (1.4 sterad) the BAT instrument is originally designed to provide fast\ntriggers for gamma-ray bursts and their accurate positions in the sky (\u223c4 arcsec). Following such\na trigger, the observatory points in the direction of the burst, which can be then observed with the\nX-ray and UV/optical telescopes onboard the satellite. While searching for bursts, BAT points at\ndifferent locations of the sky, thus, performing an all-sky monitoring in hard X-rays (measurements\nof the X-ray flux are provided by the Swift/BAT team in the form of X-ray light curves for the\nseveral hundred bright persistent and transient sources1 ). If a bright pulsating source with a known\nperiod falls into the field of view of the instrument, the total count rate stored by BAT can be\nused to search for coherent pulsations of that source. We have used this strategy to measure the\n1.24 s pulsations of Her X-1 during its so-called main-on states (when the X-ray flux of the source\nis high). Such states repeat every \u223c35 days and are believed to be caused by a precessing tilted\naccretion disk around the neutron star, see e.g. Gerend & Boynton 1976.\n1 http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/swift/results/transients/\n\n2\n\n\fMonitoring of pulse period in Her X-1\n\nD.

The first one is\nused to establish the presence of the periodic signal from Her X-1 in the BAT data, determine the\napproximate period, and construct pulse profiles (by folding the data with the found period), while\nthe second is subsequently applied to the pulse profiles to determine the precise value of the period\nand its time derivative.\nFor our analysis we used the total count rates measured by BAT with a time resolution of 64\nmsec. All times of the count rates were translated to the solar system barycenter and corrected\nfor binary motion (using our newest orbital ephemeris presented in Staubert et al. 2009). Then\nwe performed a period search using epoch folding in a narrow period interval around the expected\npulse period (\u223c1.237 s). If a strong periodic signal is present we determined the period and used it\nto construct X-ray pulse profiles for subsequent pulse phase connection.\nA convenient way to explore the variation of the pulse period, often used in phase-connection\ntechnique, is to construct the so-called (O \u2212 C) diagram showing the estimated (observed) pulse\narrival time minus the calculated one assuming a constant period. An example of such a diagram\nmeasured with BAT during one of the Her X-1 main-on states is shown in Fig. 1. A straight line in\nthe graph would correspond to a constant period defined by the slope of the line. The solid curve\nindicates the parabolic fit to the data corresponding to a constant positive \u1e56.\n\n3. Results\nUsing the method described in the previous section we determined the pulse period P and its\ntime derivative \u1e56 for most of the Her X-1 main-on states observed with BAT. For other parts of\nthe 35 d cycle, i.e. outside main-ons, the flux was too low for such determinations. At the time of\npreparing this text the data are available for the time period from March 2005 to May 2009 that\ncovers 45 35d cycles of the pulsar. For several cycles the BAT observations have relatively poor\nstatistics due to gaps in the data. For such cycles only P, but no \u1e56 could be determined.\n3\n\n\fMonitoring of pulse period in Her X-1\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\nYear\n2007\n\nD.

Where a corresponding value of \u1e56 was measured,\nthe 1\u03c3-uncertainty range is indicated by the cones, the orientation of which reproduce the measured\n\u1e56 value.\nOne can see, that for many points the locally measured \u1e56 is substantially different from the\none derived from P values of adjacent measurements (that is from the slope of the pulse period\ndevelopment). Thus, one can conclude that strong pulse period variations in Her X-1 occur on\nshorter time scales than the 35 d super-orbital period of the system.\nAlready in Fig. 2 one can notice that the strong spin-down episodes occasionally exhibited\nby Her X-1 and lasting from 1 to 3 main-ons are mostly coincident with drops in the X-ray flux.\nThis behavior can also be demonstrated by plotting values of \u1e56 versus X-ray flux (Fig. 3). The\ndata indicate an anticorrelation as predicted by the basic accretion theory. Inspection of the linear\nPearson's correlation coefficient gives the probability of \u223c4\u00d710\u22124 to find the measured correlation\nby chance.\nThe correlation is mainly driven by the group of four points with high spin-down rate and\nlow flux (in the upper left part of the graph in Fig. 3). The rest of the points forms an uncorrelated\n\"cloud\" around \u1e56 = 0. This means that most of the time the pulsar is close to the equilibrium regime,\nwhen spin-up and spin-down torques are nearly balanced. Sometimes, however, it switches to\nstrong spin-down accompanied by strong decrease of the X-ray flux. Such a behavior needs further\nexplanation. In the next section we argue that the episodes of strong spin-down are associated with\nstrong matter outflow from the inner parts of the accretion disk. The mass transfer rate through the\naccretion disk does not need to change significantly.\n\n4. Evidence for the coronal mass ejection\nIf one assumes that the accretion disk carries some magnetic field, it can interact via reconnection with the neutron star's magnetosphere beyond the corotation radius Rc . This might imply that\nbeyond Rc the field lines can sometimes inflate to become open (see also discussion in Lovelace\n4\n\n\fMonitoring of pulse period in Her X-1\n\nD.

During such episodes, a substantial fraction of matter in the inner part of the accretion\ndisk can escape the system in the form of a coronal wind ejection along the open field lines.\nSuch an ejection of matter should be reflected in a secular change of the system's orbital period which is indeed observed in Her X-1 (Deeter et al. 1991; Staubert et al. 2009). To assess the\nimportance of coronal mass ejections for the orbital period evolution, we invoked general considerations of the non-conservative treatment of binary orbital parameters (see e.g. Grishchuk et al.\n2001). First, we defined the non-conservativeness parameter in the standard way (e.g. Ritter & Kolb\n1992): \u03b7 = \u2212 \u1e40 x / \u1e40o \u2264 1, ( \u1e40o < 0). Assume that the ejected mass carries away the specific angular momentum of the neutron star we express the fractional change of the orbital period through\n\u1e40 x /M x , q and \u03b7:\n\"\n!\n#\n\u1e40 x\n1 q/3 + 1\nq\n1 \u1e56orb\n=\u2212\n1\u2212 \u2212 1\u2212\n,\n(4.1)\n3 Porb\nMx\n\u03b7\n\u03b7 q+1\nwhere M x is the mass of the accretor, \u1e40 x is the accretion rate onto the neutron star, q = M x /Mopt is\nthe binary mass ratio.\nIt is convenient to normalize the mass accretion rate onto the neutron star \u1e40 x to the value that\ncan be derived from the observed fractional change of the orbital period in the conservative case\n( \u1e40 x )cons , so that \u1e41 \u2261 \u1e40 x /( \u1e40 x )cons . In Her X-1 q \u2243 0.63 and one finds ( \u1e40 x )cons \u2243 8 \u00d7 1017 g s\u22121 for\nthe measured \u1e56orb = \u22124.85 \u00d7 10\u221211 s s\u22121 (Staubert et al. 2009). Then we can eliminate \u1e56orb /Porb\nfrom the left hand side of Eq. (4.1) to obtain the equation for \u03b7 at a given \u1e41:\n\u03b7=\n\nq2 + 2q/3 \u2212 1\n.\n(q2 \u2212 1)/\u1e41 + 2q/3\n\n(4.2)\n\nFrom here we see that \u1e41 < 1 leads to \u03b7 < 1, i. e. if one wants to decrease the mass accretion rate onto\nthe neutron star to get smaller X-ray luminosity (as is the case of Her X-1, where the mean observed\nL x \u223c 2 \u00d7 1037 erg s\u22121 is 4 times smaller than the one following from the conservative mass exchange\nanalysis, Staubert et al. 2009), a non-conservative mass exchange is required. Specifically, if we\nwant to bring in accordance the observed \u1e56orb and LX in Her X-1, we would need \u1e41 \u2243 1/4 and\n(from Eq. 4.2) \u03b7 \u223c 0.1, a fairly high non-conservative mass exchange.\nIn the frame of our model, the mass ejection from the system through the open magnetic field\nlines occurs most efficiently during strong spin-down episodes which are associated with small X5\n\n\fMonitoring of pulse period in Her X-1\n\nD. Klochkov\n\nray luminosity. Indeed, as we see in Fig 3, the observed X-ray flux is decreased by a factor of two\nduring strong spin-down. From Eq. (4.2) it is easy to find that at a given q a fractional decrease in \u1e41\nleads to comparable fractional decrease in \u03b7, i.e. accretion indeed becomes more non-conservative\nduring strong mass ejection episodes. During such episodes, the neutron star spin-down power\nI\u03c9\u03c9\u0307 is spent to expel accreting matter from the inner disk radius Rd \u223c Rc :\nI\u03c9\u03c9\u0307 \u223c \u1e40ej\n\nGM\n.\nRc\n\n(4.3)\n\nThis equation is satisfied for the observed parameters of Her X-1: ejected mass rate during strong\nspin-downs \u1e40ej \u223c 0.5 \u1e40 x \u2243 1017 g s\u22121 , \u1e56 \u2243 10\u221212 s s\u22121 , and Rc \u2243 1.3 \u00d7 108 cm.\n\nReferences\nBarthelmy, S.
