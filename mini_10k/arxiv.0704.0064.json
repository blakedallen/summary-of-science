One of the key results of our present investigation is a great deal of simplification\nin the geometrical understanding of the nilpotent (anti-)BRST symmetry invariance.\n\nPACS numbers: 11.15.-q, 12.20.-m, 03.70.+k\nKeywords: Superfield formalism; (non-)Abelian 1-form gauge theories; (anti-)BRST symmetries; symmetry invariance; horizontality condition; geometrical interpretations\n\n\f1 Introduction\nThe geometrical superfield approach [1-8] to Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) formalism\nis one of the most attractive and intuitive approaches which enables us to gain some physical\ninsights into the beautiful (but abstract mathematical) structures that are associated with\nthe nilpotent (anti-)BRST symmetry transformations and their corresponding generators.\nThe latter quantities play a very decisive role in (i) the covariant canonical quantization of\nthe gauge theories, (ii) the proof of the unitarity of the \"quantum\" gauge theories at any\narbitrary order of perturbative computations for a given physical process (that is allowed\nby the theory), (iii) the definition of the physical states of the \"quantum\" gauge theories\nin the quantum Hilbert space, and (iv) the cohomological description of the physical states\nof the quantum Hilbert space w.r.t. the conserved and nilpotent BRST charge.\nTo be specific, in the superfield formulation [1-8] of the 4D 1-form gauge theories, one\ndefines the super curvature 2-form F\u0303 (2) = d \u0303\u00c3(1) + i \u00c3(1) \u2227 \u00c3(1) in terms of the super exterior\nderivative d \u0303 = dx\u03bc \u2202\u03bc + d\u03b8\u2202\u03b8 + d\u03b8\u0304\u2202\u03b8\u0304 (with d \u03032 = 0) and the super 1-form connection \u00c3(1) on\na (4, 2)-dimensional supermanifold parametrized by the usual spacetime variables x\u03bc (with\n\u03bc = 0, 1, 2, 3) and a pair of anticommuting (i.e. \u03b82 = \u03b8\u03042 = 0, \u03b8\u03b8\u0304 + \u03b8\u0304\u03b8 = 0) Grassmannian\nvariables \u03b8 and \u03b8\u0304. The above super 2-form is subsequently equated, due to the so-called\nhorizontality condition [1-8], to the ordinary curvature 2-form F (2) = dA(1) + iA(1) \u2227 A(1)\ndefined on the ordinary 4D flat Minkowski spacetime manifold in terms of the ordinary\nexterior derivative d = dx\u03bc \u2202\u03bc (with d2 = 0) and the 1-form connection A(1) = dx\u03bc A\u03bc . The\nabove super exterior derivative d \u0303 and super 1-form connection \u00c3(1) are the generalization of\nthe 4D ordinary exterior derivative d and 1-form connection A(1) to the (4, 2)-dimensional\nsupermanifold because d \u0303 \u2192 d, \u00c3(1) \u2192 A(1) in the limit (\u03b8, \u03b8\u0304) \u2192 0.\nThe above horizontality condition (HC) has been referred to as the soul-flatness condition in [9] which amounts to setting equal to zero all the Grassmannian components of\nthe (anti)symmetric second-rank super tensor that constitutes the super curvature 2-form\nF\u0303 (2) on the (4, 2)-dimensional supermanifold. The key consequences, that emerge from\nthe HC, are (i) the derivation of the nilpotent (anti-)BRST symmetry transformations for\nthe gauge and (anti-)ghost fields of a given 4D 1-form gauge theory, (ii) the geometrical\ninterpretation of the (anti-)BRST symmetry transformations for the 4D local fields as the\ntranslation of the corresponding superfields along the Grassmannian directions of the supermanifold, (iii) the geometrical interpretation of the nilpotency property as a pair of\nsuccessive translations of the superfield along a particular Grassmannian direction of the\nsupermanifold, and (iv) the geometrical interpretation of the anticommutativity property\nof the (anti-)BRST symmetry transformations for a 4D local field as the sum of (a) the\ntranslation of the corresponding superfield first along the \u03b8-direction followed by the translation along the \u03b8\u0304-direction, and (b) the translation of the same superfield first along the\n\u03b8\u0304-direction followed by the translation along the \u03b8-direction.\nIt will be noted that the above HC (i.e. F\u0303 (2) = F (2) ) is valid for the non-Abelian (i.e.\n\n2\n\n\fA(1)(n) \u2227 A(1)(n) 6= 0) 1-form gauge theory as well as the Abelian (i.e. A(1) \u2227 A(1) = 0) 1-form\ngauge theory. As expected, for both types of theories, the HC leads to the derivation of the\nnilpotent (anti-)BRST symmetry transformations for the gauge and (anti-)ghost fields of\nthe respective theories. We lay emphasis on the fact that the HC does not shed any light\non the derivation of the nilpotent (anti-)BRST symmetry transformations associated with\nthe matter fields of the interacting 4D (non-)Abelian 1-form gauge theories.\nIn a recent set of papers [10-17], the above HC condition has been generalized, in a\nconsistent manner, so as to compute the nilpotent (anti-)BRST symmetry transformations\nassociated with the matter fields of a given 4D interacting 1-form gauge theory (along with\nthe well-known nilpotent transformations for the gauge and (anti-)ghost fields) without\nspoiling the cute geometrical interpretations of the (anti-)BRST symmetry transformations\n(and their corresponding generators) that emerge from the HC alone. The latter approach\nhas been christened as the augmented superfield approach to BRST formalism where the\nrestrictions imposed on the (4, 2)-dimensional superfields are (i) the HC plus the invariance\nof the (super) matter Noether conserved currents [10-14], (ii) the HC plus the equality of\nany (super) conserved quantities [15], (iii) the HC plus a restriction that owes its origin\nto the gauge invariance and the (super) covariant derivatives on the matter (super)fields\n[16,17], and (iv) an alternative to the HC where the gauge invariance and the property\nof a pair of (super) covariant derivatives on the (super) matter fields (and their intimate\nconnection with the (super) curvatures) play a crucial role [18-20].\nIn all the above approaches [1-20], however, the invariance of the Lagrangian densities\nof the 4D (non-)Abelian 1-form gauge theories, under the nilpotent (anti-)BRST symmetry\ntransformations, has not yet been discussed at all. Some attempts in this direction have\nbeen made in our earlier works where the specific topological features [21,22] of the 2D\nfree (non-)Abelian 1-form gauge theories have been captured in the superfield formulation\n[23-25]. In particular, the invariance of the Lagrangian density under the nilpotent and\nanticommuting (anti-)BRST and (anti-)co-BRST symmetry transformations has been expressed in terms of the superfields and the Grassmannian derivatives on them. These are,\nhowever, a bit more involved in nature because of the existence of a new set of nilpotent\n(anti-)co-BRST symmetries in the theory. The geometrical interpretations for the Lagrangian densities and the symmetric energy-momentum tensor (for the above topological\ntheory) have also been provided within the framework of the superfield formulation.\nThe purpose of our present paper is to capture the (anti-)BRST symmetry invariance of\nthe Lagrangian density of the 4D (non-)Abelian 1-form gauge theories within the framework\nof the superfield approach to BRST formalism and to demonstrate that the above symmetry invariance could be understood in a very simple manner in terms of the translational\ngenerators along the Grassmannian directions of the (4, 2)-dimensional supermanifold on\nwhich the above 4D ordinary gauge theories are considered. In addition, the reason behind\nthe existence (or non-existence) of any specific nilpotent symmetry transformation could\nalso be explained within the framework of the above superfield approach. We demonstrate\n\n3\n\n\fthe uniqueness of the existence of the nilpotent (anti-)BRST symmetry transformations\nfor the Lagrangian density of a U(1) Abelian 1-form gauge theory. We go a step further\nand show the existence of the nilpotent BRST symmetry transformations for the specific\nLagrangian densities (cf. (4.1) and (4.4) below) of the 4D non-Abelian 1-form gauge theory\nand clarify the non-existence of the anti-BRST symmetry transformations for these specific Lagrangian densities within the framework of the superfield formulation (cf. section\n5 below). Finally, we provide the geometrical basis for the existence of the off-shell nilpotent and anticommuting (anti-)BRST symmetry transformations (and their corresponding\ngenerators) for the specifically defined Lagrangian densities (cf. (4.7) and/or (4.8) below)\nof the 4D non-Abelian 1-form gauge theory in the Feynman gauge.\nThe motivating factors that have propelled us to pursue our present investigation are\nas follows. First and foremost, to the best of our knowledge, the property of the symmetry\ninvariance of a given Lagrangian density has not yet been captured in the language of the\nsuperfield approach to BRST formalism. Second, the above (anti-)BRST invariance of the\ntheory has never been shown, in as simplified fashion, as we demonstrate in our present\nendeavour. The geometrical interpretations for (i) the existence of the above nilpotent\n(anti-)BRST symmetry invariance, and (ii) the on-shell conditions of the on-shell nilpotent\n(anti-)BRST symmetries, turn out to be quite transparent in our present work. Third, we\nestablish the uniqueness of the existence of the (anti-)BRST symmetry invariance in their\nvarious forms. The non-existence of the specific symmetry transformation is also explained\nwithin the framework of the superfield approach to BRST formalism. Finally, our present\ninvestigation is the first modest step in the direction to gain some insights into the existence\nof the nilpotent symmetry transformations and their invariance for the higher form (e.g.\n2-form, 3-form, etc.) gauge theories within the framework of the superfield formulation.\nThe contents of our present paper are organized as follows. In section 2, we recapitulate\nsome of the key points connected with the nilpotent (anti-)BRST symmetry transformations\nfor the free 4D Abelian 1-form gauge theory (having no interaction with matter fields) in\nthe Lagrangian formulation. The above symmetry transformations as well as the symmetry\ninvariance of the Lagrangian densities are captured in the geometrical superfield approach\nto BRST formalism in section 3 where the HC on the gauge superfield plays a crucial role.\nSection 4 deals with the bare essentials of the nilpotent (anti-)BRST symmetry transformations for the 4D non-Abelian 1-form gauge theory in the Lagrangian formulation. The\nsubject matter of section 5 concerns itself with the superfield formulation of the symmetry\ninvariance of the appropriate Lagrangian densities of the above 4D non-Abelian 1-form\ngauge theory. Finally, in section 6, we summarize our key results, make some concluding\nremarks and point out a few future directions for further investigations.\n2 (Anti-)BRST symmetries in Abelian theory: Lagrangian formulation\nLet us begin with the following (anti-)BRST invariant Lagrangian density of the 4D Abelian\n\n4\n\n\f1-form gauge theory\u2217 in the Feynman gauge [26,27,9]\n1\n1\n(a)\nLB = \u2212 F \u03bc\u03bd F\u03bc\u03bd + B (\u2202\u03bc A\u03bc ) + B 2 \u2212 i \u2202\u03bc C\u0304 \u2202 \u03bc C,\n4\n2\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere F\u03bc\u03bd = \u2202\u03bc A\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd A\u03bc is the antisymmetric (F\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212F\u03bd\u03bc ) curvature tensor that constitutes the Abelian 2-form F (2) = dA(1) \u2261 2!1 (dx\u03bc \u2227 dx\u03bd )F\u03bc\u03bd , B is the Nakanishi-Lautrup\nauxiliary multiplier field and (C\u0304)C are the anticommuting (i.e. C 2 = C\u0304 2 = 0, C C\u0304+ C\u0304C = 0)\n(anti-)ghost fields of the theory. The above Lagrangian density respects the off-shell nilpotent (s2(a)b = 0) (anti-)BRST symmetry transformations s(a)b (with sb sab + sab sb = 0)\u2020\nsb A\u03bc = \u2202\u03bc C,\nsab A\u03bc = \u2202\u03bc C\u0304,\n\nsb C = 0,\nsab C\u0304 = 0,\n\nsb C\u0304 = iB,\nsab C = \u2212iB,\n\nsb B = 0,\nsab B = 0,\n\nsb F\u03bc\u03bd = 0,\nsab F\u03bc\u03bd = 0.\n\n(2.2)\n\nIt is clear that, under the nilpotent (anti-)BRST symmetry transformations s(a)b , the curvature tensor F\u03bc\u03bd is found to be invariant. In other words, the 2-form F (2) , owing its\norigin to the cohomological operator d = dx\u03bc \u2202\u03bc , is an (anti-)BRST invariant object for the\nAbelian U(1) 1-form gauge theory and is, therefore, a physically meaningful (i.e. gaugeinvariant) quantity. These observations will play an important role in our discussion on the\nhorizontality condition that would be exploited in the context of our superfield approach\nto (anti-)BRST invariance of the Lagrangian densities in sections 3 and 5 (see below).\nA noteworthy point, at this stage, is the observation that the gauge-fixing and FaddeevPopov ghost terms can be written, modulo a total derivative, in the following fashion\nh\n1\nsb \u2212i C\u0304 {(\u2202\u03bc A\u03bc ) + B}],\n2\nh i\ni\n1\n\u03bc\nsb sab\nA\u03bc A + C C\u0304 .\n2\n2\n\nh\n\nsab +i C {(\u2202\u03bc A\u03bc ) +\n\ni\n1\nB} ,\n2\n\n(2.3)\n\nThe above equation establishes, in a very simple manner, the (anti-)BRST invariance of\nthe 4D Lagrangian density (2.1). The simplicity ensues due to (i) the nilpotency s2(a)b = 0\nof the (anti-)BRST symmetry transformations, (ii) the anticommutativity property (i.e.\nsb sab + sab sb = 0) of s(a)b , and (iii) the invariance of the F\u03bc\u03bd term under s(a)b .\nAs a side remark, it is interesting to note that the following on-shell (i.e. \u2737C = \u2737C\u0304 = 0)\nnilpotent (s\u03032(a)b = 0) (anti-)BRST symmetry transformations (with s\u0303b s\u0303ab + s\u0303ab s\u0303b = 0)\ns\u0303b A\u03bc = \u2202\u03bc C,\ns\u0303ab A\u03bc = \u2202\u03bc C\u0304,\n\ns\u0303b C = 0,\ns\u0303ab C\u0304 = 0,\n\ns\u0303b C\u0304 = \u2212i(\u2202\u03bc A\u03bc ),\ns\u0303ab C = +i(\u2202\u03bc A\u03bc ),\n\n\u2217\n\ns\u0303b F\u03bc\u03bd = 0,\ns\u0303ab F\u03bc\u03bd = 0,\n\n(2.4)\n\nWe adopt here the notations and conventions such that the flat Minkowski metric in 4D is \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd = diag\n(+1, \u22121, \u22121, \u22121) so that A\u03bc B \u03bc = \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd A\u03bc B \u03bd = A0 B0 \u2212 Ai Bi for two non-null 4-vectors A\u03bc and B\u03bc . The\nGreek indices \u03bc, \u03bd...... = 0, 1, 2, 3 and Latin indices i, j, k.... = 1, 2, 3 stand for the 4D spacetime and 3D\nspace directions on the 4D Minkowski spacetime manifold, respectively, and the symbol \u2737 = (\u22020 )2 \u2212 (\u2202i )2 .\n\u2020\nWe follow here the notations and conventions adopted in [27]. In its full blaze of glory, the nilpotent\n(anti-)BRST transformations \u03b4(A)B are a product of an anticommuting spacetime independent parameter\n\u03b7 and s(a)b (i.e. \u03b4(A)B = \u03b7s(a)b ) where the nilpotency property is encoded in the operators s(a)b .\n\n5\n\n\fare the symmetry transformations for the following Lagrangian density\n1\n1\n(a)\nLb = \u2212 F \u03bc\u03bd F\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 (\u2202\u03bc A\u03bc )2 \u2212 i \u2202\u03bc C\u0304 \u2202 \u03bc C.\n4\n2\n\n(2.5)\n\nThe above transformations (2.4) and the Lagrangian density (2.5) have been derived from\n(2.2) and (2.1) by the substitution B = \u2212(\u2202\u03bc A\u03bc ). An interesting point, connected with the\non-shell nilpotent symmetry transformations, is to express the analogue of (2.3) as \u2021\nh i\ni\ns\u0303ab \u2212 C (\u2202\u03bc A\u03bc ) \u2212 i A\u03bc \u2202 \u03bc C ,\n2\n\nh i\ns\u0303b + C\u0304 (\u2202\u03bc A\u03bc ) + i A\u03bc \u2202 \u03bc C\u0304],\n2h\ni\ni\n1\ns\u0303b s\u0303ab\nA\u03bc A\u03bc + C C\u0304 .\n2\n2\n\n(2.6)\n\nIt should be noted that, in the above precise computation, one has to take into account\nthe on-shell (\u2737C = \u2737C\u0304 = 0) conditions so that, for all practical purposes s\u0303(a)b (\u2202\u03bc A\u03bc ) = 0.\nThe above nilpotent (anti-)BRST symmetry transformations (i.e. sr , s\u0303r with r = b, ab)\nare connected with the conserved and nilpotent generators (i.e. Qr , Q\u0303r with r = b, ab).\nThis statement can be succinctly expressed, in the mathematical form, as\nsr \u03a9 = \u2212i [ \u03a9, Qr ](\u00b1) ,\n\ns\u0303r \u03a9\u0303 = \u2212i [ \u03a9\u0303, Q\u0303r ](\u00b1) ,\n\nr = b, ab,\n\n(2.7)\n\nwhere the subscripts (with the signatures (\u00b1)) on the square bracket stand for the bracket\nto be an (anti)commutator, for the generic fields \u03a9 = A\u03bc , C, C\u0304, B and \u03a9\u0303 = A\u03bc , C, C\u0304 (of\nthe Lagrangian densities (2.1) and (2.5)), being (fermionic)bosonic in nature. The above\ncharges Qr , Q\u0303r are found to be anticommuting (i.e. Qb Qab +Qab Qb = 0, Q\u0303b Q\u0303ab + Q\u0303ab Q\u0303b = 0)\nand off-shell as well as on-shell nilpotent (Q2(a)b = 0, Q\u03032(a)b = 0) in nature, respectively.\n3 (Anti-)BRST invariance in Abelian theory: superfield formalism\nIn this section, we exploit the geometrical superfield approach to BRST formalism, endowed\nwith the theoretical arsenal of the horizontality condition, to express the (anti-)BRST\nsymmetry transformations and the Lagrangian densities (cf. (2.1) and (2.5)) in terms of\nthe superfields defined on the (4, 2)-dimensional supermanifold. The latter is parametrized\nby the spacetime coordinates x\u03bc (with \u03bc = 0, 1, 2, 3) and a pair of Grassmannian variables \u03b8\nand \u03b8\u0304. As a consequence, the generalization of the 4D ordinary exterior derivative d = dx\u03bc \u2202\u03bc\nand the 1-form connection A(1) = dx\u03bc A\u03bc (x) on the (4, 2)-dimensional supermanifold, are\nd \u03032 = 0,\nd \u2192 d \u0303 = dx\u03bc \u2202\u03bc + d\u03b8 \u2202\u03b8 + d\u03b8\u0304 \u2202\u03b8\u0304 ,\nA(1) \u2192 \u00c3(1) = dx\u03bc B\u03bc (x, \u03b8, \u03b8\u0304) + d\u03b8 F\u0304 (x, \u03b8, \u03b8\u0304) + d\u03b8\u0304 F (x, \u03b8, \u03b8\u0304),\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere the mapping from the 4D local fields to the superfields are: A\u03bc (x) \u2192 B\u03bc (x, \u03b8, \u03b8\u0304),\nC(x) \u2192 F (x, \u03b8, \u03b8\u0304) and C\u0304(x) \u2192 F\u0304 (x, \u03b8, \u03b8\u0304). The super-expansion of the superfields, in terms\n\u2021\n\nWe lay emphasis on the fact that (2.6) cannot be derived directly from (2.3) by the simple substitution\nB = \u2212(\u2202\u03bc A\u03bc ). One has to be judicious to deduce the precise expression for (2.6). The logical reasons\nbehind the derivation of (2.6) are encoded in the superfield formulation (cf. (3.9) below).\n\n6\n\n\fof the basic fields as well as the secondary fields, are (see, e.g., [4-7, 10-12]):\nB\u03bc (x, \u03b8, \u03b8\u0304) = A\u03bc (x) + \u03b8 R\u0304\u03bc (x) + \u03b8\u0304 R\u03bc (x) + i \u03b8 \u03b8\u0304 S\u03bc (x),\nF (x, \u03b8, \u03b8\u0304) = C(x) + i \u03b8 B\u03041 (x) + i \u03b8\u0304 B1 (x) + i \u03b8 \u03b8\u0304 s(x),\nF\u0304 (x, \u03b8, \u03b8\u0304) = C\u0304(x) + i \u03b8 B\u03042 (x) + i \u03b8\u0304 B2 (x) + i \u03b8 \u03b8\u0304 s\u0304(x).\n\n(3.2)\n\nIt can be readily seen that, in the limiting case of (\u03b8, \u03b8\u0304) \u2192 0, we get back our 4D basic\nfields (A\u03bc , C, C\u0304). Furthermore, on the r.h.s. of the above super expansion, the bosonic (i.e.\nA\u03bc , S\u03bc , B1 , B\u03041 , B2 , B\u03042 ) and the fermionic (R\u03bc , R\u0304\u03bc , C, C\u0304, s, s\u0304) fields do match.\nAt this juncture, we have to recall our observations after equation (2.2). The nilpotent\n(anti-)BRST symmetry transformations basically owe their origin to the cohomological\noperator d. This is capitalized in the horizontality condition where we impose the restriction\nd \u0303\u00c3(1) = dA(1) on the super 1-form connection \u00c3(1) that contains the superfields defined on\nthe (4, 2)-dimensional supermanifold. The latter condition yields the following relationships\n(see, e.g., for details, in our earlier works [21-25]):\nB1 = B\u03042 = s = s\u0304 = 0,\n\nB\u03041 + B2 = 0,\n\n(3.3)\n\nwhere we are free to choose the secondary fields (B2 , B\u03041 ) (i.e. B2 = B \u21d2 B\u03041 = \u2212B) in\nterms of the Nakanishi-Lautrup auxiliary field B of the BRST invariant Lagrangian density\n(2.1). The other relations, that emerge from the above HC (i.e. d \u0303\u00c3(1) = dA(1) ), are\nR\u03bc = \u2202\u03bc C,\n\nR\u0304\u03bc = \u2202\u03bc C\u0304,\n\nS\u03bc = \u2202\u03bc B,\n\n\u2202\u03bc B\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd B\u03bc = \u2202\u03bc A\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd A\u03bc .\n\n(3.4)\n\nAt this stage, the super-curvature tensor F\u0303\u03bc\u03bd = \u2202\u03bc B\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd B\u03bc is not equal to the ordinary\ncurvature tensor F\u03bc\u03bd = \u2202\u03bc A\u03bd \u2212\u2202\u03bd A\u03bc as the former contains Grassmannian dependent terms.\nThe substitution of the above values (cf. (3.3),(3.4)) of the secondary fields, in terms\nof the basic and auxiliary fields of the Lagrangian density (2.1), leads to\nB\u03bc(h) (x, \u03b8, \u03b8\u0304) = A\u03bc + \u03b8 \u2202\u03bc C\u0304 + \u03b8\u0304 \u2202\u03bc C + i \u03b8 \u03b8\u0304 \u2202\u03bc B,\nF (h) (x, \u03b8, \u03b8\u0304) = C \u2212 i \u03b8 B,\nF\u0304 (h) (x, \u03b8, \u03b8\u0304) = C\u0304 + i \u03b8\u0304 B,\n\n(3.5)\n\nwhere the superscript (h) has been used to denote that the above expansions have been\nobtained after the application of the HC. It can be seen that, due to (3.5), we get\n\u2202\u03bc B\u03bd(h) \u2212 \u2202\u03bd B\u03bc(h) = \u2202\u03bc A\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd A\u03bc ,\n\n(3.6)\n\nwhere there is no Grassmannian \u03b8 and \u03b8\u0304 dependence on the l.h.s.\nIn the language of the geometry on the (4, 2)-dimensional supermanifold, the expansions\n(3.5) imply that the (anti-)BRST symmetry transformations s(a)b (and their corresponding\ngenerators Q(a)b ) for the 4D local fields (cf. (2.7)) are connected with the translational\ngenerators (\u2202/\u2202\u03b8, \u2202/\u2202 \u03b8\u0304) because the translation of the corresponding (4, 2)-dimensional\nsuperfields, along the Grassmannian directions of the supermanifold, produces it. Thus,\n(h)\nthe Grassmannian independence of the super curvature tensor F\u0303\u03bc\u03bd\n= \u2202\u03bc B\u03bd(h) \u2212\u2202\u03bd B\u03bc(h) implies\nthat the 4D curvature tensor F\u03bc\u03bd is an (anti-)BRST (i.e. gauge) invariant physical quantity.\n7\n\n\fIn terms of the superfields, equations (2.3) can be expressed as\ni\n\u2202h\n1\n\u2212i F\u0304 (h) { (\u2202 \u03bc B\u03bc(h) + B) } ,\n2\n\u2202 \u03b8\u0304 h\ni\n\u2202\n1\n(h)\n\u03bc (h)\n(3.7)\nLim\u03b8\u0304\u21920\n+ iF { (\u2202 B\u03bc + B) } ,\n\u2202\u03b8\n2 i\nh\n\u2202 \u2202\ni \u03bc(h) (h)\n1\nB B\u03bc + F (h) F\u0304 (h) .\n2\n\u2202 \u03b8\u0304 \u2202\u03b8 2\nThese equations are unique because there is no other way to express the above equations in\nterms of the derivatives w.r.t. Grassmannian variables \u03b8 and \u03b8\u0304. Thus, besides (2.3), there\nis no other possibility to express the gauge-fixing and the Faddeev-Popov ghost terms in\nthe language of the off-shell nilpotent (anti-)BRST symmetry transformations (2.2). The\nsuperfield approach to BRST formulation, therefore, establishes the uniqueness of (2.3).\nTo express (2.6) in terms of the superfields, one has to substitute B = \u2212(\u2202\u03bc A\u03bc ) in (3.5).\nThus, the expansion (3.5), in terms of the transformations (2.4), becomes\u00a7\n\nLim\u03b8\u21920\n\n(h)\n\nB\u03bc(o) (x, \u03b8, \u03b8\u0304) =\n\u2261\n(h)\nF(o) (x, \u03b8, \u03b8\u0304) =\n(h)\nF\u0304(o) (x, \u03b8, \u03b8\u0304) =\n\nA\u03bc + \u03b8 \u2202\u03bc C\u0304 + \u03b8\u0304 \u2202\u03bc C \u2212 i \u03b8 \u03b8\u0304 \u2202\u03bc (\u2202 \u03c1 A\u03c1 ),\nA\u03bc + \u03b8 (s\u0303ab A\u03bc ) + \u03b8\u0304 (s\u0303b A\u03bc ) + \u03b8 \u03b8\u0304(s\u0303b s\u0303ab A\u03bc ),\nC + i \u03b8 (\u2202\u03bc A\u03bc ) \u2261 C + \u03b8 (s\u0303ab C),\nC\u0304 \u2212 i \u03b8\u0304 (\u2202\u03bc A\u03bc ) \u2261 C\u0304 + \u03b8\u0304 (s\u0303b C\u0304).\n\n(3.8)\n\nWe note that (3.5) and (3.8) are the super expansions (after the application of the HC)\nwhich lead to the derivation of the off-shell nilpotent (anti-)BRST symmetry transformations s(a)b as well as the on-shell nilpotent (anti-)BRST symmetry transformations s\u0303(a)b ,\nrespectively, for the basic fields A\u03bc , C and C\u0304 of the theory.\nThe gauge-fixing and Faddeev-Popov ghost terms of the Lagrangian density (2.5) can\nalso be expressed in terms of the superfields (3.8).

In the language of geometry on the (4, 2)-dimensional\nsupermanifold, the (anti-)BRST invariance corresponds to the Grassmannian independence\nof the supersymmetric versions of the Lagrangian density (2.1).

This observation captures the (anti-)BRST invariance of (2.1).\n4 (Anti-)BRST symmetries in non-Abelian theory: Lagrangian approach\nWe begin with the following BRST-invariant Lagrangian density, in the Feynman gauge,\nfor the four (3 + 1)-dimensional non-Abelian 1-form gauge theory\u00b6 (see, e.g. [26,27,9])\n1\n1\n(n)\nLB = \u2212 F \u03bc\u03bd * F\u03bc\u03bd + B * (\u2202\u03bc A\u03bc ) + B * B \u2212 i\u2202\u03bc C\u0304 * D \u03bc C,\n4\n2\n\n(4.1)\n\nwhere the curvature tensor (F\u03bc\u03bd ) is defined through the 2-form F (2)(n) = dA(1)(n) +iA(1)(n) \u2227\nA(1)(n) . Here the non-Abelian 1-form gauge connection is A(1)(n) = dx\u03bc (A\u03bc * T ) and the\nexterior derivative is d = dx\u03bc \u2202\u03bc . The Nakanishi-Lautrup auxiliary field B = B * T is\nrequired for the linearization of the gauge-fixing term and the (anti-)ghost fields (C\u0304)C are\nessential for the proof of the unitarity in the theory. The latter fields are fermionic (i.e.\n(C a )2 = 0, (C\u0304 a )2 = 0, C a C b + C b C a = 0, C a C\u0304 b + C\u0304 b C a = 0, etc.) in nature.\n(n)\nThe above Lagrangian density respects the following off-shell nilpotent ((sb )2 = 0)\n(n)\nBRST symmetry transformations sb , namely;\n(n)\n\nsb A\u03bc = D\u03bc C,\n(n)\n\nsb B = 0,\n\ni\n(n)\nsb C = \u2212 (C \u00d7 C),\n2\n(n)\nsb F\u03bc\u03bd = i(F\u03bc\u03bd \u00d7 C).\n\n(n)\n\nsb C\u0304 = iB,\n\n(4.2)\n\nIt will be noted that (i) the curvature tensor F\u03bc\u03bd * T transforms here under the BRST\nsymmetry transformation. However, it can be checked explicitly that the kinetic energy\nterm \u2212(1/4)F\u03bc\u03bd * F \u03bc\u03bd remains invariant under the BRST symmetry transformations, (ii)\nthe nilpotent anti-BRST symmetry transformations corresponding to the above BRST\nsymmetry transformations (4.2) cannot be defined for the Lagrangian density (4.1), and\n(iii) the on-shell nilpotent version of the above BRST symmetry transformations is also\npossible if we substitute, in the above symmetry transformations, B = \u2212(\u2202\u03bc A\u03bc ).

The horizontality condition, for\nthe non-Abelian gauge theory is the requirement of the equality of the Maurer-Cartan\nequation on the (super) manifolds. In other words, the covariant reduction of the super\n2-form curvature F\u0303 (2)(n) to the ordinary 2-form curvature (i.e. d \u0303\u00c3(1)(n) + i\u00c3(1)(n) \u2227 \u00c3(1)(n) =\ndA(1)(n) + iA(1)(n) \u2227A(1)(n) ) leads to the determination of the secondary fields in terms of the\nbasic and auxiliary fields of the theory. The ensuing expansions, in terms of the basic and\nauxiliary fields, lead to (i) the derivation of the (anti-)BRST symmetry transformations\nfor the basic fields of the theory, and (ii) the geometrical interpretations of the nilpotent\n(anti-)BRST symmetry transformations (and their corresponding nilpotent generators) for\nthe basic fields of the theory as the translations of the corresponding superfields along the\nGrassmannian directions of the (4, 2)-dimensional supermanifold (see, e.g., [16,19]).\nWith the identifications B2 = B and B\u03041 = B\u0304, the following relationships emerge after\nthe application of the horizontality condition k (see, e.g., [16]):\nR\u03bc = D\u03bc C,\nR\u0304\u03bc = D\u03bc C\u0304,\nB + B\u0304 = \u2212(C \u00d7 C\u0304),\ns = i(B\u0304 \u00d7 C),\nS\u03bc = D\u03bc B + D\u03bc C \u00d7 C\u0304 \u2261 \u2212D\u03bc B\u0304 \u2212 D\u03bc C\u0304 \u00d7 C,\n1\n1\nB\u03042 = \u2212 (C\u0304 \u00d7 C\u0304).\ns\u0304 = \u2212i(B \u00d7 C\u0304),\nB1 = \u2212 (C \u00d7 C),\n2\n2\nk\n\n(5.3)\n\nIn the rest of our present text, we shall be using the short-hand notations for all the fields e.g.:\nA\u03bc * T = A\u03bc , C * T = C, B * T = B, etc., for the sake of brevity.\n\n12\n\n\fThe substitution of the above expressions, which are obtained after the application of the\nhorizontality condition, leads to the following expansions\nB\u03bc(h) (x, \u03b8, \u03b8\u0304) = A\u03bc + \u03b8 D\u03bc C\u0304 + \u03b8\u0304 D\u03bc C + i \u03b8 \u03b8\u0304 (D\u03bc B + D\u03bc C \u00d7 C\u0304),\ni\nF (h) (x, \u03b8, \u03b8\u0304) = C + i \u03b8 B\u0304 \u2212 \u03b8\u0304 (C \u00d7 C) \u2212 \u03b8 \u03b8\u0304 (B\u0304 \u00d7 C),\n2\ni\n(h)\nF\u0304 (x, \u03b8, \u03b8\u0304) = C\u0304 \u2212 \u03b8 (C\u0304 \u00d7 C\u0304) + i \u03b8\u0304 B + \u03b8 \u03b8\u0304 (B \u00d7 C\u0304).\n2\n\n(5.4)\n\nThe above expansions (see, e.g., our earlier works [16,19]) can be expressed in terms of the\noff-shell nilpotent (anti-)BRST symmetry transformations (4.9) and (4.10).\nWith the above expansion at our disposal, the gauge-fixing and Faddeev-Popov terms\nof the Lagrangian density (4.1) can be written, modulo a total ordinary derivative, as\nLim\u03b8\u21920\n\ni\n1\ni\n\u2202h\n\u2212iF\u0304 (h) * \u2202 \u03bc B\u03bc(h) \u2212 F\u0304 (h) * B = B * (\u2202\u03bc A\u03bc ) + B * B \u2212 i \u2202\u03bc C\u0304 * D \u03bc C.\n2\n2\n\u2202 \u03b8\u0304\n\n(5.5)\n\nFurthermore, it can be seen that, due to the validity and consequences of the horizontality\ncondition, the super curvature tensor F\u0303\u03bc\u03bd has the following form [16,4]\n(h)\nF\u0303\u03bc\u03bd\n= F\u03bc\u03bd + i\u03b8(F\u03bc\u03bd \u00d7 C\u0304) + i\u03b8\u0304(F\u03bc\u03bd \u00d7 C) \u2212 \u03b8 \u03b8\u0304 (F\u03bc\u03bd \u00d7 B + F\u03bc\u03bd \u00d7 C \u00d7 C\u0304).\n\n(5.6)\n\nIt is clear from the above relationship that the kinetic energy term of the present 4D\nnon-Abelian 1-form gauge theory remains invariant, namely;\n1\n1 (h)\n* F\u0303 \u03bc\u03bd(h) = \u2212 F\u03bc\u03bd * F \u03bc\u03bd .\n\u2212 F\u0303\u03bc\u03bd\n4\n4\n\n(5.7)\n\nThe Grassmannian independence of the l.h.s. of (5.7) has deep meaning as far as physics is\nconcerned. It implies immediately that the kinetic energy term of the non-Abelian gauge\ntheory is an (anti-)BRST (i.e. gauge) invariant physical quantity.\nAt this juncture, it is worthwhile to point out that one can also capture the equation\n(4.6) in the superfield approach to BRST formalism where the on-shell nilpotent version\n(n)\nof the BRST symmetry transformations (i.e. s\u0303b ) plays an important role. For this purpose, we have to express the superfield expansion (5.4) for the on-shell nilpotent BRST\nsymmetry transformation where one has to exploit the replacement B = \u2212(\u2202\u03bc A\u03bc ). With\nthis substitution, the equation (5.4) for the superfield expansion becomes\n(h)\n\nB\u03bc(o) (x, \u03b8, \u03b8\u0304) = A\u03bc + \u03b8 D\u03bc C\u0304 + \u03b8\u0304 D\u03bc C + i \u03b8 \u03b8\u0304 [\u2212D\u03bc (\u2202 \u03c1 A\u03c1 ) + D\u03bc C \u00d7 C\u0304],\ni\n(h)\nF(o) (x, \u03b8, \u03b8\u0304) = C + i \u03b8 B\u0304 \u2212 \u03b8\u0304 (C \u00d7 C) \u2212 \u03b8 \u03b8\u0304 (B\u0304 \u00d7 C),\n2\ni\n(h)\nF\u0304(o) (x, \u03b8, \u03b8\u0304) = C\u0304 \u2212 \u03b8 (C\u0304 \u00d7 C\u0304) \u2212 i \u03b8\u0304 (\u2202\u03bc A\u03bc ) \u2212 \u03b8 \u03b8\u0304 [(\u2202\u03bc A\u03bc ) \u00d7 C\u0304)].\n2\n\n(5.8)\n\nNow, the equation (4.6) can be expressed in terms of the above superfields, as:\nLim\u03b8\u21920\n\ni\n\u2202 h i (h)\n1\n(h)\n(h)\nF\u0304(o) * (\u2202 \u03bc A\u03bc ) + i B\u03bc(o) * \u2202 \u03bc F\u0304(o) = \u2212 (\u2202\u03bc A\u03bc ) * (\u2202\u03c1 A\u03c1 ) \u2212 i \u2202\u03bc C\u0304 * D \u03bc C.\n2\n\u2202 \u03b8\u0304 2\n(5.9)\n\n13\n\n\fFurthermore, it will be noted that the analogue of (5.6), for the on-shell nilpotent BRST\n(h)\nsymmetry transformation (i.e. F\u0303\u03bc\u03bd(o) ), can be obtained by the replacement B = \u2212(\u2202\u03bc A\u03bc ).\nOnce again, the equality (5.7) would remain intact even if we take into account the on-shell\nnilpotent BRST symmetry transformations. Thus, we note that the kinetic energy term\n\u03bc\u03bd(h)\n(h)\n(i.e. (\u2212(1/4)F \u03bc\u03bd * F\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212(1/4)F\u0303(o) * F\u0303\u03bc\u03bd(o) ) of the non-Abelian gauge theory remains\nindependent of the Grassmannian variables \u03b8 and \u03b8\u0304 after the application of the HC. This\nstatement is true for the off-shell as well as the on-shell nilpotent (anti-)BRST symmetry\ntransformations. Physically, it implies that the kinetic energy term for the gauge field of\nthe non-Abelian theory is an (anti-)BRST (i.e. gauge) invariant quantity.\nThe above key observation helps in expressing the Lagrangian density (4.1) and (4.4)\nin terms of the superfields (obtained after the application of HC), as\ni\n\u2202h\ni\n1 (h)\n(n)\n* F\u0303 \u03bc\u03bd(h) + Lim\u03b8\u21920\n\u2212iF\u0304 (h) * \u2202 \u03bc B\u03bc(h) \u2212 F\u0304 (h) * B ,\nL\u0303B = \u2212 F\u0303\u03bc\u03bd\n4\n2\n\u2202 \u03b8\u0304 h\n(5.10)\ni\n1 (h)\n\u2202 i (h)\n(n)\n\u03bc\u03bd(h)\n(h)\n\u03bc\n\u03bc (h)\nL\u0303b = \u2212 F\u0303\u03bc\u03bd(o) * F\u0303(o) + Lim\u03b8\u21920\nF\u0304 * (\u2202 A\u03bc ) + i B\u03bc(o) * \u2202 F\u0304(o) .\n4\n\u2202 \u03b8\u0304 2 (o)\nThis result, in turn, simplifies the BRST invariance of the above Lagrangian density (4.1)\nand (4.4) (describing the 4D 1-form non-Abelian gauge theory) as follows\n\n\u2202 (n)\n\u2202 (n)\n(n) (n)\n(n) (n)\n(5.11)\nL\u0303B = 0 \u21d2 sb LB = 0,\nLim\u03b8\u21920 L\u0303b = 0 \u21d2 s\u0303b Lb = 0.\n\u2202 \u03b8\u0304\n\u2202 \u03b8\u0304\nThis is a great simplification because the total super Lagrangian densities (5.10) remain\nindependent of the Grassmannian variable \u03b8\u0304. This key result is encoded in the mapping\n(n) (n)\n(n)\n(n)\n(sb , s\u0303b ) \u21d4 Lim\u03b8\u21920(\u2202/\u2202 \u03b8\u0304) and the nilpotency (sb )2 = 0, (s\u0303b )2 = 0, (\u2202/\u2202 \u03b8\u0304)2 = 0.\nIt can be readily checked that the analogues of (5.5) and (5.9) cannot be expressed as\nthe derivative w.r.t. the Grassmannian variable \u03b8. To check this, one has to exploit the\nsuper expansions (5.4) and (5.8) obtained after the application of the HC (in the context\nof the derivation of the off-shell as well as the on-shell nilpotent BRST symmetry transfor(n)\n(n)\nmations sb and s\u0303b ). It can be clearly seen that the operation of the derivative w.r.t. the\nGrassmannian variable \u03b8, on any combination of the superfields from the expansions (5.4)\nand (5.8), does not lead to the derivation of the r.h.s. of (5.5) and (5.9). In the language\nof the superfield approach to BRST formalism, this is the reason behind the non-existence\nof the anti-BRST symmetry transformations for the Lagrangian densities (4.1) and (4.4).\nThe form of the gauge-fixing and Faddeev-Popov terms (4.11), expressed in terms of\nthe BRST and anti-BRST symmetry transformations together, can be represented in the\nlanguage of the superfields (obtained after the application of HC), as\nLim\u03b8\u21920\n\ni\n1\n\u2202 \u2202 h i (h) \u03bc(h)\n= B * (\u2202\u03bc A\u03bc ) + (B * B + B\u0304 * B\u0304) \u2212 i\u2202\u03bc C\u0304 * D \u03bc C.\nB\u03bc * B\n+ F (h) * F\u0304 (h)\n2\n\u2202 \u03b8\u0304 \u2202\u03b8 2\n(5.12)\nAs a consequence of the above expression, the Lagrangian densities (4.7) (as well as (4.8))\ncan be presented, in terms of the superfields, as\n(1,2)(n)\n\nL\u0303b\n\ni\n\u2202 \u2202 h i (h) \u03bc(h)\n1\n(h)\n+\n= \u2212 F\u0303 \u03bc\u03bd(h) * F\u0303\u03bc\u03bd\nB\u03bc * B\n+ F (h) * F\u0304 (h) .\n4\n\u2202 \u03b8\u0304 \u2202\u03b8 2\n\n14\n\n(5.13)\n\n\fThe BRST and anti-BRST invariance of the above super Lagrangian density (and that of\nthe ordinary 4D Lagrangian densities (4.7) and (4.8)) is encoded in the following simple\nequations that are expressed in terms of the translational generators along the Grassmannian directions of the (4, 2)-dimensional supermanifold, namely;\n\u2202 (1,2)(n)\n\u2202 (1,2)(n)\n(n) (1)(n)\n(n) (2)(n)\nL\u0303b\n= 0 \u21d2 sb L b\n= 0, Lim\u03b8\u0304\u21920 L\u0303b\n= 0 \u21d2 sab Lb\n= 0.\n\u2202\u03b8\n\u2202 \u03b8\u0304\n(5.14)\nThis is a tremendous simplification of the (anti-)BRST invariance of the Lagrangian densities (4.7) and (4.8) in the language of the superfield approach to BRST formalism. In\nother words, if one is able to show the Grassmannian independence of the super Lagrangian\ndensities of the theory, the (anti-)BRST invariance of the 4D theory follows automatically.\nIn the language of the geometry on the supermanifold, the (anti-)BRST invariance of\na 4D Lagrangian density is equivalent to the statement that the translation of the super\nversion of the above Lagrangian density, along the Grassmannian directions of the (4, 2)dimensional supermanifold, is zero. Thus, the super Lagrangian density of an (anti-)BRST\ninvariant 4D theory is a Lorentz scalar, constructed with the help of (4, 2)-dimensional\nsuperfields (obtained after the application of HC), such that, when the partial derivatives\nw.r.t. the Grassmannian variables (\u03b8 and \u03b8\u0304) operate on it, the result is zero.\nThe nilpotency and anticommutativity properties (that are associated with the conserved (anti-)BRST charges and (anti-)BRST symmetry transformations) are found to be\ncaptured very naturally (cf. (3.16)-(3.18)) when we consider the superfield formulation of\nthe (anti-)BRST invariance of the Lagrangian density of a given 1-form gauge theory. We\nmention, in passing, that one could also derive the analogue of the equations (3.16), (3.17)\nand (3.18) for the 4D non-Abelian 1-form gauge theory in a straightforward manner.\nLim\u03b8\u21920\n\n6 Conclusions\nIn our present investigation, we have concentrated mainly on the (anti-)BRST invariance\nof the Lagrangian densities of the free 4D (non-)Abelian 1-form gauge theories (having no\ninteraction with matter fields) within the framework of the superfield approach to BRST\nformalism. We have been able to provide the geometrical basis for the existence of the\n(anti-)BRST invariance in the above 4D theories. To be more specific, we have been able\nto show that the Grassmannian independence of the (4, 2)-dimensional super Lagrangian\ndensity, expressed in terms of the appropriate superfields, is a clear-cut proof that there is\nan (anti-)BRST invariance (cf. (3.16), (3.17), (3.18), (5.11), (5.14)) in the 4D theory.\nIf the super Lagrangian density could be expressed as a sum of (i) a Grassmannian\nindependent term, and (ii) a derivative w.r.t. the Grassmannian variable, then, the corresponding 4D Lagrangian density will automatically respect BRST and/or anti-BRST\ninvariance. In the latter piece of the above super Lagrangian density, the derivative could\nbe either w.r.t. \u03b8 or w.r.t. \u03b8\u0304 or w.r.t. both of them put together. More specifically,\n(i) if the derivative is w.r.t. \u03b8\u0304, the nilpotent symmetry would correspond to the BRST,\n15\n\n\f(ii) if the derivative is w.r.t. \u03b8, the nilpotent symmetry would be that of the anti-BRST\ntype, and (iii) if both the derivatives are present together, both the nilpotent (anti-)BRST\nsymmetries would be present together (and they would turn out to be anticommuting).\nFor the 4D (non-)Abelian 1-form gauge theories, that are considered on the (4, 2)dimensional supermanifold, it is the HC on the 1-form super connection \u00c3(1) that plays a\nvery important role in the derivation of the (anti-)BRST symmetry transformations. The\n \u0303\ncohomological origin for the above HC lies in the (super) exterior derivatives (d)d.\nThis\npoint has been made quite clear in our discussions after the off-shell as well as the on-shell\nnilpotent (anti-)BRST symmetry transformations (2.2), (2.4), (4.2), (4.3), (4.9) and (4.10).\nIn fact, it is the full kinetic energy term of the above theories (owing its origin to the\ncohomological operator d = dx\u03bc \u2202\u03bc ) that remains invariant under the above on-shell as well\nthe off-shell nilpotent (anti-)BRST symmetry transformations.\nThe HC produces specifically the nilpotent (anti-)BRST symmetry transformations for\nthe gauge and (anti-)ghost fields because of the fact that the super 1-form connection\n\u00c3(1) /\u00c3(1)(n) (cf. (3.1) and (5.1)) is constructed with a super vector multiplet (B\u03bc , F , F\u0304)\nwhich is the generalization of the gauge field A\u03bc and the (anti-)ghost fields (C\u0304)C (of the\nordinary 4D (non-)Abelian 1-form gauge theories) to the (4, 2)-dimensional supermanifold.\nAs a consequence, only the nilpotent and anticommuting (anti-)BRST symmetry transformations for the 4D local fields A\u03bc , C and C\u0304 are obtained when the full potential of the HC\nis exploited within the framework of the above superfield formulation.\nIt is worthwhile to point out that geometrically the super Lagrangian densities, expressed in terms of the (4, 2)-dimensional superfields, are equivalent to the sum of the\nkinetic energy term and the translations of some composite superfields (obtained after the\napplication of the HC) along the Grassmannian directions (i.e. \u03b8 and/or \u03b8\u0304) of the (4, 2)dimensional supermanifold. This observation is distinctly different from our earlier works\non the superfield approach to 2D (non-)Abelian 1-form gauge theories [24,25,23] which are\nfound to correspond to the topological field theories. In fact, for the latter theories, the\ntotal super Lagrangian density turns out to be a total derivative w.r.t. the Grassmannian\nvariables (\u03b8 and/or \u03b8\u0304). That is to say, even the kinetic energy term of the latter theories,\nis able to be expressed as the total derivative w.r.t. the variables \u03b8 and/or \u03b8\u0304.\nIn our present endeavour, within the framework of the superfield approach to BRST\nformalism, we have been able to provide (i) the logical reason behind the non-existence of\nthe anti-BRST symmetry transformations for the Lagrangian densities (4.1) and (4.4) for\nthe 4D non-Abelian 1-form gauge theory, (ii) the explicit explanation for the uniqueness\nof the equations (2.3) and (2.6) for the 4D Abelian 1-form gauge theory, (iii) the convincing proof for the on-shell nilpotent (anti-)BRST invariance of the gauge-fixing term (i.e.\n(n)\ns\u0303(a)b (\u2202\u03bc A\u03bc ) = 0, s\u0303(a)b (\u2202\u03bc A\u03bc ) = 0) for the (non-)Abelian 1-form gauge theories, and (iv) the\ncompelling arguments for the non-existence of the exact analogue(s) of (2.3) and (2.6) for\nthe non-Abelian 1-form gauge theory. To the best of our knowledge, the logical explanations for the above subtle points (connected with the 1-form gauge theories) are completely\n\n16\n\n\fnew. Thus, the results of our present work are simple, beautiful and original.\nIt is worthwhile to mention that our superfield construction and its ensuing geometrical\ninterpretations are not specific to the Feynman gauge (which has been taken into account\nin our present endeavor). To corroborate this assertion, we take the simple case of the 4D\nAbelian 1-form gauge theory and write the Lagrangian density (2.1) in the arbitrary gauge\n(a,\u03be)\n\nLB\n\n\u03be\n1\n= \u2212 F \u03bc\u03bd F\u03bc\u03bd + B (\u2202\u03bc A\u03bc ) + B 2 \u2212 i \u2202\u03bc C\u0304 \u2202 \u03bc C,\n4\n2\n\n(6.1)\n\nwhere \u03be is the gauge parameter. It is elementary to check that, in the limit \u03be \u2192 1, we get\nback our Lagrangian density (2.1) for the Abelian theory in the Feynman gauge.\nThe analogue of the equation (2.3) (for the gauge-fixing and Faddeev-Popov ghost terms\nin the case of the arbitrary gauge) can be expressed as\nh\n\u03be\nsb \u2212i C\u0304 {(\u2202\u03bc A\u03bc ) + B}],\n2\nh i\ni\n\u03be\n\u03bc\nsb sab\nA\u03bc A + C C\u0304 .\n2\n2\n\nh\n\nsab +i C {(\u2202\u03bc A\u03bc ) +\n\ni\n\u03be\nB} ,\n2\n\n(6.2)\n\nThe above expression can be easily generalized to the analogues of the equations (3.10)-\n(3.12) in terms of the superfields by taking the help of (3.8). Thus, the geometrical interpretations remain intact even in the case of the arbitrary gauge.\nIn a similar fashion, for the 4D non-Abelian 1-form gauge theory, the equations (4.5),\n(4.6) and (4.11) can be generalized to the case of arbitrary gauge and, subsequently, can\nbe expressed in terms of superfields as the analogues of (5.5), (5.9) and (5.12). Finally,\nwe can obtain the analogues of (5.7), (5.10) and (5.13) which will lead to the derivation of\nthe analogues of (5.11) and (5.14). Thus, we note that geometrical interpretations, in the\narbitrary gauge, remain the same for the 4D (non-)Abelian 1-form gauge theory within the\nframework of our superfield approach to BRST formalism.\nOur present work can be generalized to the case of the interacting 4D (non-)Abelian\n1-form gauge theories where there exists an explicit coupling between the gauge field and\nthe matter fields. In fact, our earlier works [14-18] might turn out to be quite handy in\nattempting the above problems. It seems to us that it is the combination of the HC and\nthe restrictions, owing their origin to the (super) covariant derivative on the matter (super)\nfields and their intimate connection with the (super) curvatures, that would play a decisive\nrole in proving the existence of the (anti-)BRST invariance for the above gauge theories.\nIt is gratifying to state that we have accomplished the above goals in our very recent\nendeavours [30-32]. In fact, we have been able to provide the geometrical basis for the\nexistence of the (anti-)BRST invariance, in the context of the interacting (non-)Abelian\n1-form gauge theories with Dirac as well as complex scalar fields, within the framework\nof the augmented superfield approach to BRST formalism. As it turns out, here too, the\nsuper Lagrangian density is found to be independent of the Grassmannian variables.\nIn our earlier works [33-35], we have been able to show the existence of the nilpotent\n(anti-)BRST and (anti-)co-BRST symmetry transformations for the 4D free Abelian 2-form\n17\n\n\fgauge theory. We have also established the quasi-topological nature of it in [35]. In a recent\nwork [36], the nilpotent (anti-)BRST symmetry transformations have been captured in the\nframework of the superfield formulation. It would be a very nice endeavour to study the\n(anti-)BRST and (anti-)co-BRST invariance of the 4D Abelian 2-form gauge theory within\nthe framework of superfield formulation. At present, this issue and connected problems in\nthe context of the 4D free Abelian 2-form gauge theory are under intensive investigation\nand our results would be reported in our forthcoming future publications [37].\nAcknowledgement: Financial support from the Department of Science and Technology\n(DST), Government of India, under the SERC project sanction grant No: - SR/S2/HEP23/2006, is gratefully acknowledged.\n\nReferences\n[1] J.
