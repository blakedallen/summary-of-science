Such static instanton may be well suited for the\n\"saltatory\" relaxation scenario proposed by Feng et al.\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIt has long been recognized that the effective cosmological constant \u039bef f may have contributions from a four-form field F , and that in such case\n\u039bef f = (F 2 /2) + \u039b\n\n(1)\n\nmay vary in space and time due to brane nucleation events. This has led to various proposals\nfor solving the cosmological constant problem, starting with the pioneering work of Brown\nand Teitelboim [1]. These authors considered a cosmological scenario where \u039bef f is initially\nvery large and positive, due to a large F 2 term. The additive constant \u039b in (1) is assumed\nto be negative, but not fine-tuned in any way, so its absolute value is expected to be of the\n\n\forder of some cut-off scale to the fourth power. During the cosmological evolution, \u039bef f is\n\"neutralized\" through successive nucleation of closed 2-branes (charged with respect to the\nform field), which decrease the value of F , until eventually \u039bef f is relaxed down to the small\nobserved value, \u039bobs .\nOne problem with the original scenario is that neutralization must proceed in very small\nsteps, so that any initially large \u039bef f can be brought to \u039bobs without overshooting into\nnegative values. For that, the charge of the branes should be tiny, ensuring that \u2206\u039bef f . \u039bobs\nat each step. Also, the nucleation rate must be very small, or else the present vacuum\nwould quickly decay. These two constraints make the relaxation process extremely slow\non a cosmological time-scale. Meanwhile, ordinary matter in the universe is exponentially\ndiluted by the quasi-de Sitter expansion, resulting in a disappointing empty universe.\nRecently, Feng et al. (FMSW) [2] have suggested that nucleation of coincident branes\nmay offer a solution to the \"empty universe\" problem. Their proposal can be summarized\nas follows. In the context of M-theory, a stack of k coincident D-branes supports a number\nof low energy degrees of freedom, corresponding to a U(k) super Yang-Mills (SYM) theory\nliving on the world-sheet. Consequently, the nucleation rate of coincident branes should be\naccompanied by large degeneracy factors, and could in principle be enhanced with respect\nto the nucleation of single branes. The charge of a stack of branes can be very large even\nif the individual charges are small, facilitating quick jumps from \u039bef f to \u039bobs . In this way,\nneutralization might proceed very rapidly, perhaps in just a few \"multiple\" steps of the right\nsize. Finally, the stability of the present vacuum could be due to gravitational suppression\nof the nucleation rate [1, 3].\nFMSW argued, rather heuristically, that the nucleation rate of coincident branes should\nbe enhanced by a factor of the form\nD \u223c eS ,\n(2)\n\nwhere S is the entropy of the worldsheet SYM fields. This entropy was estimated through\nsimple thermodynamic arguments, as\nS \u223c g\u2217 R 2 T 2 ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere g\u2217 is the effective number of worldsheet field degrees of freedom, and R is the size of\nthe brane at the time of nucleation. However it remained unclear in [2] which temperature\nT should be used for the worldsheet degrees of freedom. Brane nucleation takes place in an\n1/2\nambient de Sitter (dS) space characterized by a Gibbons-Hawking temperature To \u221d \u039bef f .\nThe region inside the closed brane has a smaller value of the effective cosmological constant,\nand is therefore characterized by a smaller temperature Ti . Feng et al. considered two\nalternative possibilities for the temperature of the worldsheet degrees of freedom: T1 \u223c To\nand T2 \u223c (To Ti )1/2 . The proposed enhancement of the nucleation rate and the resulting\ncosmological scenarios are quite different in both cases, and therefore it seems important to\ntry and clarify the issue of which temperature is the relevant one.\nThe purpose of this paper is to present a more formal derivation of the nucleation rate\ncorresponding to multiple brane nucleation. As we shall see, the temperature relevant for the\nworldsheet degrees of freedom is in fact determined by the internal geometry of the worldsheet [4]. For the Coleman-de Luccia (CdL) instanton, this worldsheet is a 2+1 dimensional\nde Sitter space of radius R, and the corresponding temperature is T \u223c R\u22121 . When substituted into the naive expression (3), this leads to S \u223c g\u2217 , independent of R (and hence on the\nambient dS temperatures). As we shall see, the actual result has a certain dependence on\n\n\fR due to the anomalous infrared behaviour of light fields in the lower dimensional de Sitter\nspace, but this results only in a rather mild dependence on the ambient dS temperatures.\nWe shall also see that de Sitter space allows for a \"static\" instanton which may be\nquite relevant to the nucleation of coincident branes. This is analogous to the instanton for\nthermal activation in flat space. It has a higher Euclidean action than the CdL solution, and\nhence (ignoring the degeneracy factor) it seems to represent a subdominant channel of decay.\nHowever, we shall argue that, depending on the short distance behaviour of the interactions\namongst the branes, the CdL instanton for coincident brane nucleation may simply not exist,\nand in this situation the static instanton may be the relevant one. In several respects, the\nstatic instanton appears to be better suited to the neutralization scenario proposed by Feng\net al. than the CdL one.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section II we review different proposals for neutralization of \u039bef f via brane nucleation. Section III contains a discussion of coincident branes\nin 4 spacetime dimensions. These are obtained from dimensional reduction of type IIA supergravity in ten dimensions. In the 4 dimensional picture, the gravitational and four-form\nforces are both repulsive. However, the two are exactly balanced by the attractive force\nmediated by the scalar dilaton. In Section IV and V we discuss the stabilization of the\ndilaton, which is required in a more realistic scenario. After the dilaton aquires a mass, the\nremaining long range forces are repulsive, rendering the stack of coincident branes unstable,\nor metastable at best. This has important implications, since the instanton for nucleation\nof coincident branes will only exist provided that some mechanism causes an attractive\ninterbrane force at short distances.\nSection VI contains a description of the CdL instanton for nucleation of coincident branes,\nhighlighting a few limiting cases of interest. In Section VII we discuss the corresponding\ndegeneracy factor in the nucleation rate, and we show that its dependence on the ambient\nde Sitter temperatures is rather mild. We also include a heuristic interpretation of this\nresults based on the observation that the relevant temperature for the worldsheet degrees\nof freedom is determined by the inverse of the radius of the instanton. Implications for the\nscenario of [2] are briefly discussed.\nSection VIII, is devoted to a study of the \"static\" instanton, where the worldsheet has\nthe topology S 2 \u00d7 S 1 , and where the intrinsic temperature is comparable to To . In this\ncase, the dependence of the nucleation rate on the ambient dS temperature is exponential.\nCoincident brane nucleation can be unsuppressed at large To but strongly suppressed at\npresent. Our conclusions are summarized in Section IX. Some technical discussions are left\nto the Appendices.\nTo conclude this Introduction, a disclaimer may be useful. For most of the paper, we\nshall work directly in four dimensions, and our discussion will be certainly less than rigorous\nfrom the string theory point of view. In particular, we shall model the degrees of freedom of\na stack of k coincident 2-branes by a weakly coupled U(k) gauge theory on the world-sheet.\nThis may or may not correspond to a true dimensional reduction from M-theory, but it\nshould at least represent some of the broad features of the degeneracy factors.\nII.\n\nNEUTRALIZATION v.s. RANDOMIZATION\n\n\u221a\nIn four dimensions, a four form can be written as F\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 = F \u2212g\u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 where g is the\ndeterminant of the metric and \u01eb is the Levi-Civita symbol. This field has no propagating\ndegrees of freedom, since in the absence of sources the equation of motion d\u2217 F = 0 implies\n\n\fthat F is a constant. This simply gives a contribution to the effective cosmological constant\nwhich gets added to the true cosmological constant, or vacuum energy density \u039b,\n\u039bef f =\n\nF2\n+ \u039b.\n2\n\n(4)\n\nFour-forms may couple to \"charged\" 2-dimensional extended sources, or 2-branes, through\na term of the form\nZ\nq A,\n(5)\n\u03a3\n\nwhere the integral is over the worldsheet of the extended object and A is the 3-form potential\n(F = dA). In this case, F changes by\n\u2206F = q\n\n(6)\n\naccross a brane of charge q. Consequently, F can decay through nucleation of closed spherical\nbranes. The process is analogous to pair creation in the presence of an electric field, and\nvery similar to false vacuum decay in field theory [5]. The closed brane is the boundary of a\nnewly formed \"true\" vacuum bubble, where the field strength differs from the original value\nby the amount (6). After nucleation, the radius of the bubble grows with constant proper\nacceleration, and the volume occupied by the new phase keeps increasing. Further nucleation\nevents take place in the region with a low F , lowering \u039bef f even further. In the absence of\ngravity, this \"neutralization\" would proceed as long as F > q/2, wiping out any large initial\n2\nvalue of F 2 and leaving us with a large negative cosmological constant \u039bfefinal\nf \u223c \u039b + O(q ).\nOf course, this is not what we want.\nGravitational effects can improve the picture dramatically [1]. In particular, tunneling\nfrom flat or Anti-de Sitter space (with a negative cosmological constant) is forbidden provided that the squared tension of the branes is sufficiently large compared with the jump\n\u2206\u039bef f \u223c qF in energy density across the brane,\n\u03c3 2 > (4/3)qF Mp2 .\n\n(7)\n\nHere \u03c3 is the brane tension and Mp2 = 1/(8\u03c0G) is the square of the reduced Planck mass.\nThis gravitational \"shutdown\" of brane nucleation could be useful, since an initially large\n\u039bef f may eventually get \"neutralized\" to a value which is much smaller than \u039b in absolute\nvalue [1]. Suppose that the true cosmological constant is negative \u039b < 0. As long as\n\u039bef f > 0, branes keep nucleating. But once a vacuum with \u039bef f \u2264 0 is reached, the process\nstops provided that Eq. (7) is satisfied. After that, the vacuum becomes absolutely stable.\nBrown and Teitleboim conjectured that we may live in one such vacuum, where the effective\ncosmological constant is expected to be of the order of the energy density gap between\nneighboring vacua\n1/2\n|\u039bfefinal\n.\n(8)\nf | \u223c F \u2206F \u223c q|\u039b|\nIn this vacuum, |F | \u223c |\u039b|1/2 , and the huge negative bare cosmological constant is almost\ncompletely cancelled by the F 2 contribution in the final state.\nFor sufficiently small charge q, Eq. (8) leads to a suppression of |\u039bfefinal\nf | relative to the\ntrue vacuum energy |\u039b|, which might be helpful in solving the \"old\" fine tuning problem of\nthe cosmological constant. Particle physics models suggest |\u039b| & (T eV )4 . Hence, we need\nq . 10\u221235 (eV )2 ,\n\n(9)\n\n\fobs\n\u221211\nso that the final value |\u039bfefinal\n(eV )4 . The\nf | is consistent with the observed value |\u039bef f | \u223c 10\nconstraint (9) seems rather demanding, since in the context of supergravity we would expect\nq to be closer to the Planck scale. This is the so-called \"gap problem\". FMSW argued that\nthe smallness of the charge could be due to the wrapping of branes on degenerating cycles in\nthe extra dimensions. A successful implementation of this idea has not yet been presented,\nbut some plausibility arguments have been given in [2]. Alternatively, in a different context,\nit has been suggested that branes with a very tiny charge q may arise due to symmetries\nof the theory. An explicit example was given in [6], where the branes are not fundamental\nobjects but domain walls of a broken discrete symmetry. This same symmetry suppresses\nthe coupling of the domain walls to the four-form F without any fine-tuning of parameters\n(see also [7] for a fuller discussion).\nA more severe problem of the Brown and Teitelboim neutralization scenario, is the \"empty\nuniverse\" problem which we discussed in the Introduction. By combining the condition\n(9) with the stability condition (7), it can be shown that the time required to reach the\nvalue (8) is huge compared with the age of the universe [1]. By the time the effective\ncosmological constant would be wiped out, all other forms of matter would have also been\ndiluted exponentially, in clear contradiction with observations. Furthermore, the endpoint\nof neutralization would be a state with vanishing or negative effective cosmological constant,\nwhereas the observed value \u039bobs\nef f is positive.\nOne way around the empty universe problem is to consider a slightly different scenario,\nwhere the effective cosmological constant is \"randomized\" (rather than neutralized) during\ninflation. Assume, for simplicity, that the energy scale of inflation is much larger than\n\u2206\u039bef f . In an inflationary phase, brane nucleation processes may increase as well as decrease\nthe value of F 2 [4] . Thus, \u039bef f will randomly fluctuate up and down the ladder as a result\nof brane nucleation. Inflation is generically eternal to the future and there is an unlimited\namount of time available for the randomization process to take place before thermalization\n[4]. Assume that the tunneling barriers are sufficiently high, so that no nucleation events\nhappen in the last 60 e-foldings of inflation, or during the hot phase after thermalization\nup to the present time. In this scenario there is no empty universe problem: the local value\nof \u039bef f is decided many e-foldings before the end of inflation, and a wide range of values of\n\u039bef f will be found in distant regions of the universe, separated from each other by distances\nmuch larger than the present Hubble radius. Some of these regions will just happen to have\na very tiny \u039bef f . In combination with anthropic selection effects, this approach may be used\nto explain the smallness of the observed effective cosmological constant [4, 6, 8, 9]. This\nmay also explain the so-called cosmic time coincidence, or why do we happen to live at the\ntime when an effective cosmological constant starts dominating [4, 9, 10].\nBousso and Polchinski [11] have proposed a somewhat related \"randomization\" scenario\nwhich, moreover, does not rely on branes with the exceedingly small charge q satisfying (9).\nIn the context of string theory one may expect not just one but many different four-form\nfluxes Fi coupled to branes with different charges qi . Each one of these fluxes is quantized\nin units of the charge, so that Fi = ni qi . In this case, the condition for\nnegative\nPJa generic\n2 2\ncosmological constant to be compensated for by the fluxes is |\u039bef f | = | i=1 (qi ni )/2 + \u039b| .\n\u039bobs . The larger the number of different fluxes, the denser is the discretuum of possible\nvalues of \u039bef f , and the easier it is to find a set of values of ni such that the above inequality\nis satisfied. A sufficiently dense discretuum is typically obtained provided that the number\nof fluxes is sufficiently large J \u223c 100, even if the individual charges qi are Planckian (a\nsmaller number of fluxes J & 6 may be enough in a scenario with large extra dimensions,\n\n\fwhere the charges qi are suppressed with respect to the Planck scale by a large internal\nvolume effect). In the Bousso-Polchinski model, \u039bef f is typically very large, and drives\nan exponential expansion at a very high energy scale. Suppose we start with a single\nexponentially expanding domain characterized by a set of integers {ni }. Whenever a brane\nof type j nucleates in this region, the integer nj will change by one unit inside of the brane.\nThe newly formed region will itself expand exponentially, creating a huge new domain. The\nnucleation of further branes within this region will cause an endless random walk of the\nvalues of {ni }, which will sample the whole discretuum of values of \u039bef f . Eventually, a\nbubble will nucleate where \u039bef f is comparable to the observed value. The nucleation of this\nlast bubble is still a high energy process, which kicks some inflaton field off its minimum, and\nstarts a short period of inflation within this last bubble. This period of \"ordinary\" inflation is\nnecessary in order to produce the entropy we observe, thereby avoiding the empty universe\nproblem. Of course, some anthropic input is still necessary in this approach in order to\nexplain why, out of the discretuum of possibilities, we live in a vacuum with small \u039bef f .\nNucleation of coincident branes would drastically modify the neutralization scenario of\nBrown and Teitelboim, as well as the randomization scenarios sketched above. As proposed\nin [2], in the case of neutralization, this modification may lead to a solution of the empty\nuniverse problem. In the randomization scenarios there is no such problem, and it is unclear\nwhether an enhancement of the multiple brane nucleation rate is desirable at all. This\nenhancement would trigger large jumps in the effective cosmological constant, making the\ncalculation of its spatial distribution more complicated than for single brane nucleation.\nThus, it is of interest to understand the conditions under which multiple brane nucleation\nis allowed, and what are the degeneracy factors which might enhance their nucleation rate\nrelative to the nucleation of single branes. Before addressing this issue, it will be convenient\nto present a short discussion of coincident branes.\nIII.\n\nCOINCIDENT BRANES IN 4D\n\nIn the context of string theory, one may consider stacks of k coincident D-p-branes. Each\nbrane in the stack has charge q with respect to the form field A. Thus, in four noncompact\ndimensions, a pair of parallel 2-branes repel each other with a constant force per unit area\ngiven by\nfq = q 2 /2,\n(10)\ndue to the four-form field interaction. In the ten dimensional theory, the repulsive force due\nto A is balanced with other contributions from the closed string sector, such as the graviton\nand dilaton. As a result, there are no net forces amongst the different branes on the stack.\nIt is in principle possible to maintain this delicate balance by suitable compactification\nfrom 10 to 4 dimensions. In 4D, the branes look like domain walls, and their interaction\nthrough the ordinary graviton leads to a mutual repulsive force given by [12],\nf\u03c3 = 3\u03c3 2 /4Mp2 .\n\n(11)\n\nHence, both forces given by (10) and (11) tend to push the branes apart from each other.\nOn the other hand, some of the higher dimensional gravitational degrees of freedom are\nrepresented by scalars in 4D, and these, together with the dilaton, lead to attractive forces.\n\n\fA.\n\nDimensional reduction\n\nLet us first consider the case of D-2-branes in 10 dimensional Type IIA supergravity. The\nrelevant part of the action is given by (see e.g. [13])\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ\nZ\n8 Z\np\n\u221a\n\u0001\n1\nM10\n\u22122\u03c6\n2\n\u2212\u03c6\n3\n10\n2\nR + 4(\u2207\u03c6) \u2212\nd x G e\nF\u0302 \u2212 T2 d \u03be G\u03a3 e + q\u03022 d3 \u03be \u00c2.\nS10 =\n2\n2 * 4!\n\u03a3\n\u03a3\n(12)\n\u221a\n\u221a\nHere, G and G\u03a3 are the determinants of the 10 dimensional metric GAB and of the metric\ninduced on the worldsheet \u03a3, respectively, whereas R is the Ricci scalar corresponding to\nGAB . The hats on the four-form, the gauge potential, and the corresponding charge, are\nintroduced in order to distinguish them from the four dimensional ones which will be used\nbelow, and which differ from those by constant normalization factors. Compactifying on a\nCalabi-Yau manifold K through the ansatz\nds210 = e2\u03c6\u22126\u03c8 g\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd + e2\u03c8 dK62 ,\nwhere the Greek indices run from 0 to 3, we readily obtain the following four-dimensional\naction:\n\u001a\n\u001b\nZ\nMp2\n2\n6\n1\n4 \u221a\n2\n2\n\u22122\u03c6\u0302 2\nS4 =\nd x g R \u2212 (\u2202 \u03c6\u0302) \u2212 (\u2202 \u03c3\u0302) \u2212\n(13)\ne F\u0302\n2\n7\n7\n2 * 4!\nZ\nZ\n\u03c6\u0302\n3 \u221a\n\u2212T2 d \u03be \u03b3 e + q\u03022 \u00c2.\n\u03a3\n\nMp2\n\n\u03a3\n\n8\nM10\nV6 ,\n\nHere,\n=\nwhere V6 is the coordinate volume of the manifold K, R is the Ricci\nscalar for the metric g, and we have introduced two linear combinations of the internal\nvolume modulus \u03c8 and the dilaton \u03c6\n\u03c6\u0302 = 2\u03c6 \u2212 9\u03c8,\n\n\u03c3\u0302 = \u03c6 \u2212 \u03c8.\n\nThe field \u03c3\u0302 decouples from the branes, and shall be ignored in what follows. In Ref.[2],\na different expression was given for the dimensionally reduced action, because no modulus\nwas introduced for the size of the internal space. However, as we shall see, such modulus is\nnecessary for the cancellation of forces among the branes.\nA more direct route to the 4-dimensional theory (13), which will be slightly more convenient for our discussion, is to start directly from 11-dimensional supergravity and compactifying on a 7 dimensional internal space. The action in eleven dimensions is given by\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ\nZ\n9 Z\np\n\u221a\nM11\n1\n3\n11\n2\nS11 =\n\u00c2.\n(14)\nd x G R\u2212\nF\u0302 \u2212 T2 d \u03be G\u03a3 + q\u03022\n2\n2 * 4!\n\u03a3\n\u03a3\n\n3\nwhere T2 = q\u03022 = 2\u03c0M11\n. Introducing the ansatz\n\nds211 = e\u22127\u03c8\u0302 g\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd + e2\u03c8\u0302 d\u03a927 ,\nwith a Ricci flat internal manifold, we find\n\u001b\n\u001a\nZ\nMp2\n1\n2\n4 \u221a\n2\n\u22122\u03c6\u0302 2\nS4 =\nd x g R \u2212 (\u2202 \u03c6\u0302) \u2212\ne F\u0302 + * * * ,\n2\n7\n2 * 4!\n\n(15)\n\n(16)\n\n\f9\nwhere Mp2 = M11\nV7 and\n\n21\n\u03c8\u0302.\n2\nNot surprisingly, this has the same form as (13), since after all the 10-dimensional Lagrangian\ncan be obtained from the 11-dimensional one by compactifying on a circle.\nEq. (16) is a particular case of the slightly more general action in four dimensions:\n\u001b\n\u001a\nZ\nZ\nZ\n1\n1 \u22122\u03b1\u03c6 2\n4 \u221a\n3 \u221a\n2\n2\n\u03b1\u03c6\nd x g Mp [R \u2212 (\u2202\u03c6) ] \u2212\nS4 =\ne\nF \u2212 \u03c3 d \u03be \u03b3 e + q A.\n(17)\n2\n4!\n\u03a3\n\u03a3\n\u03c6\u0302 = \u2212\n\nThe parameter \u03b1 characterizes the scalar charge of the brane. As we shall see below, linearizing in \u03c6 around \u03c6 = 0, it can be easily shown that the scalar force is given by\nfe = \u2212e2 /2,\n\n(18)\n\nwhere we have introduced the scalar charge\ne \u2261 \u03b1\u03c3/Mp .\n\n(19)\n\nThus, from (10), (11) and (18), the branes will be in indifferent equilibrium provided that\nthe following relation holds:\n\u0014 2\n\u0015\ne \u2212 q2\n3\u03c3 2\n2\nQ \u2261\n= 0.\n(20)\n\u2212\n2\n4Mp2\nFrom (19), this condition can be rewritten as\n\u00131/2\n\u0012\n\u03c3\n3\n2\n.\nq= \u03b1 \u2212\n2\nMp\n\n(21)\n\np\nNote that the case of Type IIA supergravity discussed above, corresponds to \u03b1 = 7/2,\n\u221a\n\u221a\nq = ( 2/Mp ) q\u03022 , and \u03c3 = T2 [note that \u00c2 = ( 2/Mp )A]. Therefore (21) is satisfied provided\nthat T2 = q\u03022 , the usual BPS condition.\nB.\n\nMultiple brane solutions\n\nMultiple brane solutions to (17) can easily be constructed provided that (21) is satisfied.\nIn the bulk, the equation of motion for A leads to\n\u221a\nF\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 = F e2\u03b1\u03c6 g \u01eb\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 ,\nwhere F is a constant and \u01eb is the Levi-Civita symbol. At the branes, this constant jumps\nby the amount\n\u2206F = q\nIt can be checked that the remaining equations of motion for the scalar and the gravitational\nfield follow from the action\n\u001b\n\u001a 2\nZ\nXZ\nMp\n\u221a\n2\n4 \u221a\n[R \u2212 (\u2202\u03c6) ] \u2212 Vi (\u03c6) \u2212 \u03c3 d3 \u03be \u03b3 e\u03b1\u03c6 ,\nS4 =\ndx g\n(22)\n2\n\u03a3\ni\ni\n\n\fwhere\n\nFi2 2\u03b1\u03c6\ne ,\n2\nand the sum is over the regions with different values of F . With the metric ansatz\nVi (\u03c6) =\n\n(23)\n\nds2 = w 2 (z)\u03b7ab dxa dxb + dz 2 ,\nwhere Latin indices run from 0 to 2, the solution is given by\ne\u2212\u03b1\u03c6 = ci \u00b1\nand\n\n\u03b12\n|Fi |\nz,\n2\n1/2\n(\u03b1 \u2212 3/2) Mp\n\u03c6\n\nw(z) = e\u2212 2\u03b1 .\n\n(24)\n\n(25)\n\nHere, ci are integration constants. These, and the sign option in (24), must be chosen so\nthat the junction conditions for the gravitational field and for the scalar field are satisfied\nat the branes. For the gravity part, the condition is [14],\n[Kab ] = \u22124\u03c0G\u03c3 e\u03b1\u03c6 \u03b3ab ,\n\n(26)\n\nwhere [Kab ] is the difference of extrinsic curvature on the two sides of the brane and \u03b3ab is\nthe world-sheet metric. In the present case, this reduces to\n\u0014 \u2032\u0015\nw\n\u03c3\n=\u2212\ne\u03b1\u03c6 .\n(27)\n2\nw\n2Mp\nFor the scalar field, the junction condition which follows from the equation of motion at the\nbrane reduces to\n\u03c3\n(28)\n[\u03c6\u2032 ] = \u03b1 2 e\u03b1\u03c6 ,\nMp\nwhich is consistent with (27) and (25). For instance, a solution with two branes separated\nby a distance d is given by flat space (w = 1, \u03c6 = 0) in the region between the branes, and\nby\n\u03c3\ne\u2212\u03b1\u03c6 = 1 \u2212 \u03b12 2 (|z| \u2212 d/2)\n(|z| > d/2)\n(29)\nMp\nin the exterior region (see Fig 1). The solution corresponds to two branes of charge q\ninterpolating between regions with F = q and F = \u2212q, separated by a region with F = 0.\nNote that the solution (29) contains a singularity at a distance z \u223c Mp2 /\u03b12 \u03c3 (where the\nwarp factor w and the volume of the internal space vanish). In what follows, however, we\nshall not be interested in flat, infinite branes, such as the ones discussed above. Rather, we\nshall be interested in compact instanton solutions of finite size, in a theory with a stabilized\ndilaton. In this case, the singularities due to linear potentials of the form (29) should not\narise, but the solutions discussed above should remain a good description in the vicinity of\nthe branes. Another consequence of stabilizing the dilaton is that the perfect balance of\nforces amongst the branes will be spoiled at distances larger than the inverse mass of the\nmoduli, as we now discuss.\n\n\fF =q\n\nF =0\n\nF = \u2212q\n\ne\u2212\u03b1\u03c6\nPSfrag replacements\nd\n\nFIG. 1: Configuration of two parallel branes\nIV.\n\nSTABILIZING THE MODULI\n\nAs it stands, the dimensionally reduced supergravity lagrangian (13) [or its generalization (17)] is not useful for discussing the neutralization of the cosmological constant. The\nlagrangian does not include the bare cosmological term \u039b, which is precisely the subject of\nour interest, and the term proportional to F 2 does not behave as an effective cosmological\nconstant, but rather as an exponential potential for a modulus \u03c6 (which is not flat enough to\nmimick the vacuum energy 1 ). A more realistic model is obtained by introducing a stabilization mechanism which fixes the expectation value of \u03c6, and gives it some mass m. Once \u03c6 is\nstabilized the F 2 term does behave as a contribution to \u039bef f . Stabilization is also desirable\nbecause the dilaton and the radion moduli (corresponding to the size of extra dimensions)\nmediate scalar interactions of gravitational strength, which are severely constrained by observations. The study of mechanisms for stabilization is currently an active topic of research\n(see e.g. [16, 17] and references therein). Although the details of stabilization will not be\ntoo important in our subsequent discussion, it may be nevertheless illustrative to have in\nmind a specific toy mechanism (for which we do not claim any rigorous justification in the\ncontext of string theory).\nThe general problem is that the potential (23) has no minimum and leads to a runaway\ndilaton. In order to create a minimum, let us consider two contributions which may be\nadded to (23). First of all, instead of using a Ricci flat internal manifold in (15) we may\ncompactify on an Einstein manifold, with\n\u03a9\n\u03a9\nRab\n= 6Kgab\n.\n1\n\n(30)\n\nExponential potentials such as the one appearing in (22) have been thoroughly studied in the literature,\nand it is known that they can drive cosmological solutions with a power-law scale factor [15]. Such\nattractor solutions are approached for a wide range of initial conditions, and the resulting expansion\ncan be accelerating or decelerating, depending on whether \u03b12 < 1/2 or \u03b12 > 1/2. For \u03b12 < 3/2 the\n2\ncosmological scale factor approaches a(t) \u223c t1/2\u03b1 , where t is cosmological time. This solution corresponds\nto an effective equation of state p = [(4\u03b12 /3) \u2212 1]\u03c1, where the ratio of kinetic and potential energies of\nthe scalar field \u03c6 remains constant. In our case, from (21), we need \u03b12 > 3/2 and therefore the kinetic\nterm becomes completely dominant in the long run, which leads to p = +\u03c1. Hence, by itself, the F 2 term\ndoes not behave like an effective cosmological constant.\n\n\fUpon dimensional reduction, the curvature K contributes an exponential term to the effective potential for \u03c6. However, this will still not be sufficient for stabilizing the internal\nvolume in an interesting way. In fact, as shown by Nunez and Maldacena [18], there are\nno static compactifications of the classical supergravity Lagrangian with a positive effective four-dimensional cosmological constant \u039bef f > 0, and so far we have added nothing\nto the classical Lagrangian. Thus, in order to implement the four dimensional situation of\nour interest, a third term related to quantum corrections has to be considered. Following\nCandelas and Weinberg [19], we may consider the Casimir energy of bulk fields (we are of\ncourse assuming that supersymmetry is broken, so that the Casimir contributions of bosons\nand fermions do not cancel each other exactly).\nIn the example considered by Candelas and Weinberg [19], besides the Casimir energy\nterm, a higher dimensional cosmological term \u039b4+n was used, and the internal manifold\nwas taken to be a space of constant positive curvature (K = 1). In 11-D supergravity a\ncosmological constant is not allowed, so here we use the F 2 flux instead. Also, we will need\nto compactify on a negatively curved internal manifold (K = \u22121), or else the dilaton would\nbe stabilized at negative \u039bef f .\nThe versatility of negatively curved compactifications has been stressed in [20]. In particular, they have the interesting property of rigidity, which means they do not lead to other\nmoduli besides the size of the internal space. Compact hyperbolic manifolds (CHM) can be\nobtained from the maximally symmetric negatively curved space H7 through identifications\nby a discrete isometry group \u0393. The volume of H7 /\u0393 is given by\nV7 = rc7 e\u03b3 ,\n\n(31)\n\nwhere rc is the curvature radius of the manifold, related to the curvature parameter in\n(30) by K = \u22121/rc2 . The factor e\u03b3 depends on the topology, and it is bounded below but\nnot above. If L is the largest distance around the manifold, then for L \u226b rc /2 we have\ne\u03b3 \u223c e6L/rc . The Kaluza Klein (KK) spectrum in this manifold is believed to have a mass\ngap, bounded below by mKK \u223c e\u2212\u03c8\u0302 rc\u22121 . From the 11 dimensional point of view the Casimir\nenergy density scales like\n(11)\n\u221211\u03c8\u0302 \u221211\n\u03c1C = Cm11\nrc .\n(32)\nKK = Ce\nThe factor C can be estimated by naive dimensional analysis as C \u223c \u03b2\u03bd, where \u03bd \u223c 103 is\nthe number of physical polarizations of bulk fields, and \u03b2 is some small one-loop factor. This\nfactor will depend on the precise topology of the compact hyperbolic manifold, but it could\nplausibly be in the range \u03b2 \u223c 10\u22122 \u2212 10\u22124 . Hence, the parameter C could be of order one.\nExplicit calculations for different choices of the manifold H7 /\u0393 have not been performed,\nand are well beyond the scope of the present paper (see e.g. [21] and references therein).\nIn what follows we shall leave C unspecified, assuming that a compactification exists where\n(11)\n|C| & 1. Multiplying the higher dimensional energy density \u03c1C given in (32) by the size of\nthe internal manifold, V7 e7\u03c8\u0302 , and by a factor e\u221214\u03c8\u0302 which arises from the four-dimensional\nvolume element in going to the Einstein frame, the effective potential which appears in Eq.\n(22) gets replaced by\n9\nVi (\u03c6) = \u221221 M11\nV7 Ke\u22129\u03c8\u0302 + C V7 rc\u221211 e\u221218\u03c8\u0302 +\n\nFi2 \u221221\u03c8\u0302\ne\n,\n2\n\n(33)\n\nwhere\nwe have also added the curvature contribution. Here \u03c8\u0302 = \u2212(2/21)\u03b1\u03c6, where \u03b1 =\np\n7/2.\n\n\fWe can always adopt the convention that rc = 1/M11 , since a change of rc \u2192 e\u2212\u03bb rc can\nbe reabsorbed by a shift in \u03c8\u0302 \u2192 \u03c8\u0302 + \u03bb and a constant re-scaling of the four-dimensional\nmetric g\u03bc\u03bd \u2192 e7\u03bb g\u03bc\u03bd (in this frame, the curvature of the manifold is of the order of the\nhigher\u221a dimensional \u221a\nPlanck scale for |\u03c8\u0302| . 1). Since Fi = ni q, where ni is an integer and\n3\n/Mp , we have\nq = ( 2/Mp )q\u03022 = 2 2\u03c0M11\n\"\n#\n\u0012\n\u00134\nM11\n2\nVi (\u03c6) = Mp2 M11\n21 e\u22129\u03c8\u0302 + C e\u221218\u03c8\u0302 + 4\u03c0 2 n2i\n(34)\ne\u221221\u03c8\u0302 .\nMp\nAs illustrated by Eq. (31) a large value of V7 in units of rc = 1/M11 can be obtained by using\n9\n2 \u03b3\na manifold with sufficiently complicated topology. Since Mp2 = M11\nV7 = M11\ne , the factor\n4\n\u22122\u03b3\n(M11 /Mp ) = e\nin the last term of (34) can be rather small. The scale M11 could be as\nlow as the T eV , in which case that factor can be as low as 10\u221264 . Moreover, as emphasized\nin [20], this can be achieved for CHM even if the linear size L of the internal manifold is not\nvery much larger than rc . In Fig. 2 we plot the effective potential for C = \u221220, e\u2212\u03b3 = 10\u22123\nand values of ni = 485, 487, 489 and 491.\nWhen a single brane nucleates, it changes ni by one unit, and hence changes the value\nof the effective potential at the minimum (changing therefore the effective cosmological\nconstant). If the discretuum of values of Fi were sufficiently dense, then there would always\nbe one of the minima of the effective potential where the vacuum energy is sufficiently\nsmall to match observations. In the case we have considered here, the discretuum is not\ndense enough. The cancelation between the last term in (33) and the other two requires\n4\nni \u223c (Mp /M11 )2 , and so the gap between levels near Vi = 0 can be estimated as \u2206Vi \u223c M11\n,\nwhich is far too large. This situation can be remedied by considering 5M branes wrapped\naround 3-cycles in the internal space. As emphasized by Bousso and Polchinski [11], these\nare coupled (with different charges) to additional fluxes, and a large number of fluxes will\nresult in a much denser spectrum. Alternatively, FMSW have suggested that the branes\nmay wrap a degenerating cycle [2], in which case the individual charges might themselves\nbe exponentially smaller than the fundamental scale, resulting also in a sufficiently dense\ndiscretuum.\nV\n30\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n-0.2 -0.1\n\nPSfrag replacements\n0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5\n\n\u03c8\u0302\n\nFIG. 2: The effective potential (34), for different values of the integer ni which characterizes the\nquantized flux of the four-form F .\n\nBefore closing this Section, we should note that the location where the modulus sits is\nbasically determined by the competition between the two first terms in (33), corresponding to\n\n\fcurvature and Casimir energy. The physical curvature radius of the internal space is therefore\n\u22121 1/(D\u22122)\nC\n, where D = 11 is the spacetime dimension.\nstabilized at rphys = rc e\u03c8\u0302 \u223c M11\nThus, unless the constant C in Eq. (32) is exceedingly large, the compactification scale\nis comparable to the inverse of the higher dimensional cut-off scale M11 . In such case the\nsemiclassical analysis which we have entertained above is not justified, since higher order\ncorrections will be just as important as the one loop effect which we have included. This\nappears to be a generic problem when we try to stabilize by making the curvature and\nthe Casimir terms comparable, as in the Candelas and Weinberg example [19]. There, the\nproblem was not quite as poignant, since the constant C could be made very large by adding\na sufficient number of fields (also, as it is clear from the above estimate of rphys , the problem\nis somewhat milder if the number of extra dimensions is smaller). Here we shall not dwell\non this problem, since the main purpose of the above discussion is just to illustrate the\nrole of the four-form in obtaining a discretuum of states. For more fundamental approaches\nto moduli stabilization in the present context, the reader is referred to [16] and references\ntherein. Our ensuing discussion will be largely independent of the details of the stabilization\nmechanism.\nV.\n\nINTER-BRANE FORCES\n\nInevitably, the stabilization of \u03c6 spoils the perfect balance of forces. At distances larger\nthan the inverse of the mass of the modulus m\u22121 , the remaining gravitational and four-form\ninteractions are both repulsive, and lead to a linear potential per unit surface of the form\n\u0014 2\n\u0015\nq\n3\u03c3 2\nV(d) \u2248 \u2212\nd\n(d \u226b m\u22121 )\n(35)\n+\n2\n2\n4Mp\nwhere d is the distance between the branes.\nTo investigate the behaviour of the interaction potential at distances shorter than m\u22121 ,\nlet us first consider the situation where gravity and the 3-form gauge potential A are ignored,\nand the branes interact only through a scalar field \u03c6 of mass m. The action is given by:\nZ\nZ\n\u0002\n\u0003\nMp2\n\u221a\n4\n2\n2 2\nS=\u2212\nd x (\u2202\u03c6) + m \u03c6 \u2212 \u03c3 d3 \u03be \u03b3 e\u03b1\u03c6 .\n(36)\n2\n\u03a3\n\nThe solution with a single brane on the plane z = 0 has the cusp profile\n\u03c6 = \u03c60 e\u2212m|z| ,\n\n(37)\n\nwhere \u03c60 is a solution of\n\u03c60 e\u2212\u03b1\u03c60 = \u2212\n\ne\n\u03b1\u03c3\n\u2261\n\u2212\n.\n2mMp2\n2mMp\n\nThe energy per unit area of this configuration is given by\nZ\n\u0001\nMp2\n\u03b1\u03c60\ndz \u03c6\u2032 2 + m2 \u03c62 = \u03c3e\u03b1\u03c60 + mMp2 \u03c620 .\n\u03c31 = \u03c3e\n+\n2\n\nFor small charge and tension, we have\n\n\u03c31 \u2248 \u03c3 \u2212\n\ne2\n,\n4m\n\n(e2 \u226a 2m\u03c3).\n\n(38)\n\n(39)\n\n\fDue to the scalar field dressing, the effective tension of the brane, denoted by \u03c31 , is smaller\nthan the parameter \u03c3 which appears in the action. This effect becomes more dramatic if we\nplace a large number k of branes on top of each other. Since both \u03c3 and e scale like k, the\neffective tension of the stack is given by\n\u0015\n\u0014\ne2\n,\n(k e2 \u226a 2m\u03c3),\n(40)\n\u03c3k \u2248 k \u03c3 \u2212 k\n4m\nwhich grows with k but less than linearly. In the limit of very large k, using (38) with \u03c3\nreplaced by k\u03c3 we have\n\u0013\n\u0012\nm\u03c3 2 2 k e2\n\u03c3k \u2248 2 ln\n,\n(k e2 \u226b 2m\u03c3)\n(41)\ne\n2m\u03c3\nand so the tension almost saturates, growing only logarithmically with k. This last expression\nshould not be taken too literally, however, since in (36) we are neglecting gravitational\neffects. As shown above, nonlinear effects of gravity become important at a distance given\nby Mp2 /\u03b12 \u03c3k , which in the limit given by (41) is smaller than m\u22121 . Hence the cusp solution\n(37), which has typical width \u223c m\u22121 , will receive sizable gravitational corrections in the\nlimit of large k. Nevertheless, it still seems likely that the effective tension of the stack of\nbranes will grow with k much slower than linearly. Physically, the reason is that the scalar\ncharge of the stack increases with k. According to (28), this means that the cusp in the\nfield \u03c6 on the branes grows stronger, which in turn means that the value of the field \u03c60 on\nthe branes has to be further displaced into negative values. Hence, the brane contribution\nto the effective tension k\u03c3e\u03b1\u03c60 shows only a very modest growth with k, and the tension\nfor large k is in fact dominated by the potential and gradient energy of the scalar near the\nbrane.\nLet us now look at the interaction potential between two branes separated from each\nother. For simplicity, we shall restrict attention to the case of small scalar charge, e2 \u226a 2m\u03c3.\nThen, the last term in (36) is well approximated by its linearized expression:\nZ\nZ\n\u0002\n\u0003\nMp2\n\u221a\n4\n2\n2 2\nS=\u2212\nd x (\u2202\u03c6) + m \u03c6 \u2212\nd3 \u03be \u03b3 (\u03c3 + eMp \u03c6).\n(42)\n2\n\u03a3\n\nPlacing the two branes at z = \u00b1d/2, the solution for the scalar field has the \"Golden Gate\"\nprofile shown in Fig. 3\ne\ne\u2212md/2 cosh mz,\n|z| < d/2\n(43)\n\u03c6=\u2212\nmMp\ne\ncosh(md/2) e\u2212m|z| .\n|z| > d/2\nmMp\nThe energy per unit area of this configuration, as a function of the interbrane distance, is\ngiven by\ne2 \u2212md\n\u03c32 (d) = 2\u03c31 \u2212\ne\n.\n(44)\n2m\nFrom this expression, and adding the long range contributions from gravity and the fourform, the interaction potential per unit surface is given by\n\u0015\n\u0014 2\ne2 \u2212md\n3\u03c3 2\nq\nd\u2212\n+\ne\n.\nV(d) = \u2212\n2\n4Mp2\n2m\n\u03c6=\u2212\n\n\fAt short distances, this takes the form\nV(d) = \u2212\nwhere the parameter\n\nme2 2\ne2\n+ Q2 d \u2212\nd + ...\n2m\n4\n\n\u0015\ne2 \u2212 q 2\n3\u03c3 2\nQ \u2261\n,\n\u2212\n2\n4Mp2\n2\n\n\u0014\n\n(45)\n\n(46)\n\nwas introduced in (20). As shown in Section III, dimensional reduction from the supergravity\nlagrangian with BPS charges gives Q2 = 0. In this case, the linear term in (45) disappears.\nThe quadratic term is negative, which means that the stack of coincident branes is unstable and tends to dissolve. Thus the stabilization of the modulus \u03c6 seems to make the\nsuperposition of branes an unstable configuration.\nAs we shall see in more detail in Section VII, stacks of branes in marginal or unstable\nequilibrium will not be appropriate for constructing instantons, since in particular these\nwould have too many negative modes. The instanton is only meaningful if the branes\nattract each other. The above analysis shows that at the classical level, the branes with\nBPS values of the charges would not attract each other, and consequently the nucleation of\ncoincident branes is not allowed at least in the semiclassical description.\nThere may be several escape routes to this conclusion. For instance, after supersymmetry\nbreaking, the charges of the branes get renormalized, and it is possible that the corrected\ncharges satisfy Q2 > 0. In this case the branes in the stack would attract each other\nwith a linear potential. Other mechanisms by which nearby branes attract each other are\nconceivable, but here we shall not try to pursue their study. It should be emphasized,\nhowever, that this remains an important open question which needs to be addressed in order\nto justify the semiclassical description of coincident brane nucleation. In section VII, where\nwe discuss the degeneracy factor, we shall simply postulate that an attractive interaction\nexists at short distances.\n\n\u03c6\n\nd\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\nFIG. 3: Profile of a massive dilaton in the presence of two branes.\n\nVI.\n\nCOLEMAN-DE LUCCIA (CDL) INSTANTONS\n\nThe brane nucleation rate per unit volume is given by an expression of the form [5]\n\u0393 = De\u2212B ,\n\n(47)\n\n\fwhere B = SE (I)\u2212SE (B). Here SE (I) is the Euclidean action of the instanton corresponding\nto the decay of the four-form field, and SE (B) is the action for the background solution before\nnucleation. The prefactor D will be discussed in the next section. The formal expression\n(47) can be used both in flat space and in curved space. Also, it can be used at zero or at\nfinite temperature. The difference is in the type of instanton and background solutions to\nbe used in each case.\nIn this section, we shall concentrate in the maximally symmetric instanton. In flat space,\nthis represents the decay of a metastable vacuum at zero temperature. The Euclidean\nsolution can be described as follows [5]. At infinity, the field strength takes the value Fo ,\nwhich plays the role of a false vacuum. Near the origin, we have F = Fi = Fo \u2212 q. This plays\nthe role of a true vacuum phase. Both phases are separated by the Euclidean worldsheet of\nthe brane, which is a three-sphere of radius\nR=\n\n3\u03c3\n.\n\u01eb\n\n(48)\n\nHere, \u03c3 is the tension of the brane and\n1\n\u01eb = (Fo2 \u2212 Fi2 ) = q[Fo \u2212 (q/2)]\n2\n\n(49)\n\nis the jump in the energy density accross the brane. The difference in Euclidean actions\nbetween the instanton and the background solution is given in this case by [5]\nB (f lat) \u2248\n\n27\u03c0 2 \u03c3 4\n.\n2 \u01eb3\n\n(50)\n\nIf instead of considering a single brane, we are looking at the nucleation of k coincident\nbranes, an analogous solution of the Euclidean equations of motion should be considered.\nThe only difference is that the effective charge is a factor of k higher, and the effective\ntension is also higher by approximately the same factor. Using (40), we should replace\n\u01eb \u2192 \u01ebk = kq[Fo \u2212 (kq/2)],\n\u03c3 \u2192 \u03c3k \u2248 k[\u03c3 \u2212 (ke2 /4m)],\n\n(51)\n\nin Eq. (50) for the \"bounce\" action. As shown in Section V, the approximate form of \u03c3k\nis valid when the second term in the r.h.s. of (51) is small compared with the first. In the\nmodel considered in Section IV, the modulus is stabilized with a mass of order m \u223c M11 .\nThis may be regarded as a conservative upper bound for the general case. Since e = \u03b1\u03c3/Mp ,\nthe condition (ke2 /4m) \u226a \u03c3 requires\n\u00132\n\u0012 3 \u0013\u0012\n1 M11\nMp\nk\u226a 2\n.\n(52)\n\u03b1\n\u03c3\nM11\nFor larger k, gravitational corrections to the brane profile become important on a lengthscale\ncomparable to the inverse mass of the dilaton, as we discussed in the previous section. In\nthis case the instanton solution will depend on the detailed dynamics of the dilaton near\nthe brane. The investigation of these dilatonic instantons is per se an interesting problem,\nwhich we leave for further research. Here, for simplicity, we shall assume a scenario where\n\n\f3\neither \u03c3 \u226a M11\n, due perhaps to the wrapping of branes on a degenerating cycle, or where\nthe extra dimensions are relatively large, so that Mp \u226b M11 , and we shall restrict attention\nto instantons where the number of branes is bounded by (52). This gives\n(f lat)\n\nBk\n\nk \u03c34\n27\u03c0 2\n.\n2 q 3 [Fo \u2212 (kq/2)]3\n\n\u2248\n\n(53)\n\nNucleation in flat space is impossible when the number of branes is too large, since otherwise\nwe would be jumping to vacua with a higher energy density. Therefore, we must restrict\nto k < 2Fo /q. In fact, the minimum value of Fi is achieved for the largest k satisfying\nk < (Fo /q) + (1/2). Note that the action increases faster than linearly as we increase the\nnumber of branes k, but we still have\n(f lat)\n\nBk\n\n\u223c k B (f lat)\n\nthroughout this range.\nWhen gravity is taken into account, the maximally symmetric instanton was given by\nColeman and De Luccia [3]. It is constructed by gluing two different de Sitter solutions\n(that is, two four-spheres) at the worldsheet of the brane, which is still a three-sphere. The\ninstanton is sketched in Fig. 4. The four-spheres have the radii Ho\u22121 and Hi\u22121 , where\nHo2 =\n\n\u039bef f\n,\n3MP2\n\nHi2 =\n\n\u039bef f \u2212 \u01eb\n,\n3MP2\n\n(54)\n\nare the Hubble rates of the de Sitter phases before and after the nucleation event, respectively. Here, and in what follows, we are assuming that the effective cosmological constant\nis still positive after nucleation, since these are the final states we are interested in. The\nbubble radius at the time of nucleation (which coincides with the radius of the three-sphere)\nis bounded by 0 < R < Ho\u22121 . Analytic expressions for R are given in Refs.[1, 3].

In the opposite limit, \u03c3Ho /\u01eb \u226b 1, we have (Ho\u22121 \u2212 R) \u226a Ho\u22121 and\nB (wall) \u2248 2\u03c0 2 \u03c3Ho\u22123 .\n\n(56)\n\nThe vacuum energy difference \u01eb is unimportant in this case, and the action coincides with\nthat for domain wall nucleation [22].\nFinally, the gravitational field of the brane is important when\n\u03c3 \u226b MP2 Ho .\n\n(57)\n\nIn this case, the radius of the worldsheet is given by R \u2248 (1/2\u03c0G\u03c3), and\nB (wall) \u2248\n\n\u03c0\n.\nGHo2\n\n(58)\n\nIn this limit, the action of the instanton is much smaller than the action of the background,\nand this is the reason why (58) is independent of the tension.\nThe same arguments apply of course to the instantons with coincident branes, and the\ncorresponding expressions for the action and radii in the different regimes are summarized\nin Table I.\nVII.\n\nTHE PREFACTOR FOR CDL INSTANTONS\n\nThe prefactor D in Eq. (47) is given by [5]\nZ\u2032\nD=\n.\nZB\n\n(59)\n\nHere, Z and ZB are the Gaussian integrals of small fluctuations around the instanton and the\nbackground solutions respectively. Expanding all brane and bulk fields\nP (which we generically\ndenote by \u03c6) around the instanton configuration \u03c6I as \u03c6 = \u03c6I + j \u03b4\u03c6j , we have SE [\u03c6] =\n\n\fSE [I] + S (2) [I, \u03b4\u03c6j ] + ..., where S (2) includes the terms quadratic in \u03b4\u03c6j . At the one loop\norder we have\nZ\n(2)\n\u2032\nZ = \u03a0j D \u2032 (\u03b4\u03c6j ) e\u2212S .\n\nIn the functional integral, there are some directions which correspond to spacetime translations of the instanton. The primes in the numerator of (59) and in the previous equation\nindicate that the translational zero modes are excluded from the integration, and replaced\nby the corresponding spacetime volume. The latter is subsequently factored out in order to\nobtain a nucleation rate per unit time and volume.\nThe degrees of freedom which live on the brane will make a contribution to the numerator\nbut not to the denominator. Consider, for instance, a free bosonic field \u03a6 of mass m\u03a6 living\non the worldsheet. Its contribution to the prefactor is\nZ\nR 1/2\n2\n2\n3\n\u2212W\u03a6\nD\u03a6 = Z \u03a6 = e\n= D\u03a6 e \u03b3 \u03a6 (\u2206 \u2212m\u03a6 ) \u03a6d \u03be\nHere, the integral in the exponent is over the Euclidean worldsheet of the brane. If we have\nk 2 of such fields, their effect on the nucleation rate is to replace\nBk \u2192 Bk + k 2 W\u03a6 ,\n\n(60)\n\nin the naive expression for the nucleation rate, \u0393 \u223c e\u2212Bk , a replacement which can become\nvery important as we increase the number of fields. This is, in essence, the observation made\nby Feng et al. that the large number of worldsheet fields might strongly affect the nucleation\nrate.\nA.\n\nScalars\n\nThe Euclidean worldsheet in the Coleman-de Luccia instanton is a 3-sphere. Determinantal prefactors due to scalar fields were considered in some detail in [23]. They are given\nby\nZ \u03c0y\n1\n\u2032\n2\nW\u03a6 = \u2212\u03b6R (\u22122) + (y /2) ln(sin \u03c0y) \u2212 2\nx ln(sin x)dx,\n(61)\n\u03c0 0\n\nwhere y 2 = 1 \u2212 m2\u03a6 R2 and \u03b6R is the usual Riemann Zeta function. For instance, the\ncontribution of a conformally coupled scalar field can be obtained by taking m2\u03a6 = (3/4)R\u22122,\nwhich gives\n1\n7\nWc = \u2212\u03b6R\u2032 (\u22122) + ln 2 \u2212\n\u03b6R (3) \u2248 0.0638\n8\n16\u03c0 2\nHence, the effective degeneracy factor contributed by a conformal scalar field is given by\nDc \u2248 e\u2212Wc \u2248 0.94 < 1.\n\n(62)\n\nThe first thing to note is that this factor is not an enhancement, but a suppression. Hence,\nthe prefactor cannot simply be thought of as the exponential of an entropy. More generally,\nfrom Eq. (61), the prefactor is independent of the expansion rate of the ambient de Sitter\nspace. This has implications for the scenario proposed by FMSW, as we shall discuss in the\nnext Section.\n\n\fIn general, the degeneracy factor will depend on R and on the mass of the particle. For\nlight minimally coupled scalars, equation (61) gives\n\u2032\n\nDs \u2248\n\ne\u03b6R (\u22122)\n\u03c0 1/2 m\u03a6 R\n\n(m\u03a6 R \u226a 1).\n\n(63)\n\nThere can be a strong enhancement in the nucleation rate if there are very light scalar\nfields. In the limit m\u03a6 \u2192 0 the factor goes to infinity. This is because a massless scalar has\na normalizable zero mode on the sphere, corresponding to the symmetry \u03a6 \u2192 \u03a6 + const.\nIn this case, the zero mode must be treated as a collective coordinate. The nucleation rate\nis proportional to the range \u03b4\u03a6 of the field \u03a6, because the bubbles can nucleate with any\naverage value of the scalar field with equal probability [23]\n\u2032\n\n[m\u03a6 Ds (m\u03a6 )](\u03c0R3 )1/2 \u03b4\u03a6 = e\u03b6R (\u22122) R1/2 \u03b4\u03a6.\nDs (m2\u03a6 = 0) = lim\n2\nm\u03a6 \u21920\n\n(64)\n\nFinally, for large mass the expression (61) leads to\nDs \u2248 exp(\u03c0m3\u03a6 R3 /6)\n\n(m\u03a6 R \u226b 1).\n\n(65)\n\nThe exponent of this expression can be interpreted as a renormalization of the tension of\nthe stack of branes, due to the heavy scalars living on it [24]. Indeed, the effective potential\nfor a scalar field in 2+1 dimensions in the flat space limit is proportional to m3\u03a6 , and the\nfactor of R3 is just due to the volume of the worldsheet. The factor Ds is plotted in Fig. 5\nfor different values of m\u03a6 R.\nDs\n10\n8\n6\n4\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\n2\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nm\u03a6 R\n\nFIG. 5: Contribution of a scalar field to the prefactor D in the nucleation rate (47), as a function\nof its mass m\u03a6 (measured in units of the inverse radius of the instanton.) At low mass, the\nenhancement is due to large phase space: bubbles can nucleate with values of the field in the range\n(66), which becomes larger for smaller masses. The enhancement at large mass can be understood\nas a finite renormalization of the brane tension.\n\nNote that there is an enhancement both at smal and at large mass, but the two have\nvery different origin. The large value of (63) for light fields can be interpreted as a phase\nspace enhancement. As we shall discuss in Subsection VII-D, quantum fluctuations of fields\nliving on the worldsheet of the brane are characterized by a temperature T = 1/2\u03c0R. The\ncorresponding fluctuations in the potential term are of order m2\u03a6 \u03a62 \u223c T 3 , which corresponds\nto a root mean squared expectation value for \u03a6 of the order\n\u03b4\u03a6 \u223c\n\n1\n.\nmR3/2\n\n(66)\n\n\fEq. (63) is recovered if we insert the range (66) in Eq. (64). The lighter the field, the\nlarger is the phase space factor \u03b4\u03a6, and the larger is the nucleation rate. For m\u03a6 R \u226b 1 this\nargument cannot be used, since the field does not behave as effectively massless. In that limit\nthe field decouples, as it should, and its effect is felt as a renormalization of the parameters\nin the lagrangian. For a scalar field, the leading effect is to renormalize the tension of the\nbrane, making it lower (See Appendix A). This causes an exponential enhancement of the\nnucleation rate.\nB.\n\nU (k) fields\n\nBesides scalar fields, gauge bosons and fermions may live on a brane. At low energies,\nthe field content on a stack of coincident branes will be model dependent. The idea is that it\nwill correspond to a gauge theory whose symmetry is enhanced when branes are coincident,\ngiving rise to a large number of light species on the worldsheet. The details of the theory,\nhowever, will depend on whether we start from 2D branes which descend directly from the\nten dimensions, of from higher dimensional p-branes wraped on (p-2)-cycles. They will\nalso depend on the details of compactification. Rather than building a particular scenario\nfrom first principles, here we shall try to gain some intuition by considering a toy model\ndirectly in four dimensions. The degrees of freedom on the stack of k coindident branes will\nbe bluntly modeled by a weakly coupled SUSY U(k) gauge theory on the 2+1 dimensional\nworldsheet. This contains a U(k) gauge field, (k 2 \u22121) scalar degrees of freedom in the adjoint\nrepresentation of SU(k), and a scalar singlet; plus the corresponding fermionic degrees of\nfreedom. The action for the worldsheet fields is given by\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ\n\u221a 3 1\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bc\nSSY M = \u2212\n(67)\n\u03b3d \u03be Tr(F\u03bc\u03bd F ) + Tr(D\u03bc \u03c6D \u03c6) + V(\u03c6) + ... ,\n2\nwhere the ellipsis indicate the terms containing fermions. Here F\u03bc\u03bd is the field strength of the\ngauge field A\u03bc = A\u03bca \u03bba , where \u03bba are the generators of U(k), normalized by Tr(\u03bba \u03bbb ) = \u03b4ab /2,\nand \u03c6 = \u03c6a \u03bba , where \u03c6a are real scalar fields (a, b = 1, ..., k 2 ). By analogy with the well\nknown case of D-branes in 10 dimensions, we shall assume that if the coincident branes are\nflat (as in the case when there is no external four-form field), then the theory is supersymmetric and all degrees of freedom are massless. The scalar field \u03c6 is a hermitian matrix and\ncan always be diagonalized by a suitable U(k) gauge transformation, \u03c6 = diag(\u03c61 , ..., \u03c6k ).\nThe eigenvalues \u03c6i , i = 1, ..., k are then interpreted as the positions of the different parallel\nbranes along an axis perpendicular to them (if the codimension of the branes were higher,\nthere would be additional scalar matrices representing the positions of the branes along the\nadditional orthogonal directions, but here we are interested in the case of codimension one).\nIn the supersymmetric case, the potential for the scalar field vanishes, V(\u03c6) = 0. However,\nfor non-flat branes, the displacement of the stack of branes no longer behaves as an exatly\nmassless field [23, 25], but one which couples to a combination of the worldsheet and extrinsic curvatures, as well as to the background four-form field. Also, after moduli stabilization,\nthe forces amongst branes are nonvanishing, and this also contributes to the potential for\nthe relative displacements of the different branes. Thus, as we shall see, there will be a\nnonvanishing potential V(\u03c6) 6= 0 in the physical situation of our interest.\nWhen the positions are not coincident, the U(k) symmetry breaks to a smaller group\nbecause some of the gauge bosons aquire masses m2A = (g 2 /2)(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j )2 . There are always\n\n\fat least k massless vectors (corresponding to Maxwell theory on the individual branes on the\nstack) and the remaining k 2 \u2212 k have double degeneracy. For example, in the case of a single\nbrane, the scalar field will represent the Goldstone mode of the broken translational symmetry, associated to transverse displacement of the brane.\n\u221a For the case of two branes, there\nare two such scalars. One of them, \u03c6+ = (\u03c61 + \u03c62 )/ 2, will corresponds to simultaneous\n\u221a\nmotion of both branes, and is a singlet under SU(2). The other one, \u03c6\u2212 = (\u03c61 \u2212 \u03c62 )/ 2,\nwill correspond to relative motion of the branes and it transforms under SU(2). When the\ntwo branes move apart, \u03c6\u2212 acquires an expectation value and two of the gauge bosons get\na mass, breaking the symmetry U(2) \u2192 U(1) \u00d7 U(1).\nThe case of interest to us is not a flat brane, but the world-wolume of the 2-brane in the\nCdL instanton, which forms a 3-sphere of radius R. In this situation, we do not expect the\ntheory to be supersymmetric (in particular, corrections to the effective action will appear\nat one loop, which will be related in fact to the determinantal prefactor in the nucleation\nrate). The case of a single brane is very similar to the case of a vacuum bubble, and in that\ncase we know that the transverse displacements correspond to a scalar field of negative mass\nsquared [23, 25]\nm2+ = \u22123R\u22122 .\n(68)\nThe origin and precise value of this mass term can be understood geometrically, since it\nleads to four normalizable zero modes which are the spherical harmonics with l = 1. These\ncorrespond to the four space-time translational modes of the instanton, which have to be\ntreated as collective coordinates. This scalar field has also a single negative mode, which\nis the constant l = 0 mode. A negative mode is precisely what is needed for an instanton to contribute to the imaginary part of the vacuum energy, and hence to contribute to\nfalse vacuum decay [5]. Integrating out the transverse displacement of the brane gives a\ndeterminantal prefactor of the form [23]\nD+ =\n\n\u03c3 2 R2 \u03b6R\u2032 (\u22122)\ne\n\u03a9,\n4\n\n(69)\n\nwhere \u03a9 = V T is the spacetime volume. The prefactor in the nucleation rate (47) per unit\ntime and volume is obtained after dividing by \u03a9. The above argument neglects gravity, and\nit is a good approximation when \u03c30 \u226a Mp2 Ho . The case of strong gravity \u03c30 \u226b Mp2 Ho is far\nmore complicated, since one has to integrate over fluctuations of the gravitational field in\nthe bulk, and is left for further research.\nIf there are 2 coincident branes, then there are two independent transverse displacements\ncorresponding to the eigenvalues \u03c61 and \u03c62 . The \"center of mass\" displacement \u03c6+ behaves\njust like in the case of a single brane. The orthogonal combination \u03c6\u2212 represents the brane\nseparation, and the two-brane instanton will only be relevant if this second combination\nacquires a positive mass through some mechanism, so that there is a single negative mode,\nnot two, and four normalizable zero modes in total. In other words, the branes must attract\neach other. As shown in Section V, if the branes have BPS charges, they in fact tend to\nrepel each other once the dilaton is stabilized, and the configuration with coincident branes\nis unstable. In this case, we do not expect that there will be any instanton representing the\nnucleation of multiple branes.\nOne possible way out of this conclusion, is to assume that the charges are different from\ntheir BPS values, due to supersymmetry breaking effects, so that the sum Q2 defined in\nEq. (46) is positive. In that case, the two branes attract each other with a linear potential.\n\n\fThe canonical field \u03c6\u2212 is related to the interbrane distance d by |\u03c6\u2212 | = \u03c3 1/2 d. Hence, the\ninterbrane potential (45) takes the form\nme2 2\n\u03c6 + ...\n(70)\n4\u03c3 \u2212\nThis potential is attractive at small distances, and has a maximum at \u03c6\u2212 = \u03c6m \u223c\nQ2 \u03c3 1/2 /me2 . Classically, the branes will attract at short distances. However, there is a\ndanger that they will be separated by quantum fluctuations. As we discussed in the previous Subsection (and we will argue more at length in Subsection D) quantum fluctuations of\nfields living on the worldsheet of the brane are characterized by a temperature T = 1/2\u03c0R.\nThe fluctuations in the potential are of order V \u223c T 3 , and these correspond to a root mean\nsquared expectation value for \u03c6\u2212 of the order\nV(\u03c6\u2212 ) = Q2 \u03c3 \u22121/2 |\u03c6\u2212 | \u2212\n\n\u03b4\u03c6\u2212 \u223c \u03c3 1/2 /R3 Q2 .\n\n(71)\n\nThe stability of the two-brane instanton requires that \u03b4\u03c6\u2212 \u226a \u03c6m . Otherwise, unsuppressed\nquantum fluctuations take the field over the barrier and the distance between the branes\nstarts growing without bound. This requires\nme2\n.\n(72)\nR3\nIf this condition is satisfied, then \u03c6\u2212 is trapped near the origin, and the branes stay together.\nIt can be shown that for Q4 \u226b \u03c3R\u22125 the field behaves as approximately massless in the\nrange given by (71), so from (64) its contribution to the prefactor can be estimated as\nQ4 \u226b\n\nD\u2212 \u223c R1/2 \u03b4\u03c6\u2212 \u223c\n\n\u03c3 1/2\n.\nR5/2 Q2\n\n(73)\n\nAs in the case of the massive field discussed in the previous Section, this expression is\nonly justified when D\u2212 \u226b 1. If Q2 is too large, then the field will not behave as massless\nin the range (71), and we expect that for Q4 \u226b \u03c3R\u22125 the sole effect of the field will be to\nrenormalize the coefficients of operators such as the brane tension in the classical lagrangian.\nAn inconvenient feature of the linear potential (70) is that is non-analytic at the origin, and\nhence an explicit calculation in the limit of large slope is not straightforward. Moreover, we\ncannot write down an expression for it in terms of the matrix operator \u03c6, but just in terms\nof its eigenvalues \u03c6i .\nAnother possibility, which is more tractable from the formal point of view, is to assume\nthat there is an attractive interbrane potential which is quadratic at short distances. That\nis, as in (70) with Q2 = 0 but with a positive coefficient in front of the second term. In\nterms of the eigenvalues \u03c6i , which represent the displacements of the branes, we assume the\nfollowing expression for the potential\nX\n1\nV(\u03c6j ) = m2+ \u03c62+ + m2\u2212\n(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j )2 + ...,\n(74)\n2k\nij\nP\nwhere \u03c6+ = k \u22121/2 ki=1 \u03c6i = k \u22121/2 Tr(\u03c6) and m2+ = \u22123R\u22122 [as given in Eq. (68)], while\nm2\u2212 > 0 is a new parameter which characterizes the attractive interaction at short distances.\nIn terms of the field \u03c6, we can write the potential as\nV(\u03c6) = m2+ k \u22121 (Tr\u03c6)2 + m2\u2212 [Tr\u03c62 \u2212 k \u22121 (Tr\u03c6)2 ]\n\n(75)\n\n\fk2\n\nX\n1\n1\n\u03c62b ,\n= m2+ \u03c621 + m2\u2212\n2\n2\nb=2\n\nwhere in the last equality we have expanded \u03c6 = \u03c6a \u03bba in the basis of generators \u03bba , and\nwe have used \u03bb1 = (2k)\u22121/2 1 and Tr\u03bbb = 0 for b = 2, ..., k 2 . In the symmetric phase\n(and assuming m\u2212 R \u226a 1) each one of the adjoint fields \u03c6b will contribute a determinantal\nprefactor of the form\n\u2032\ne\u03b6R (\u22122)\nD\u2212 \u2248 1/2\n, (m\u2212 R \u226a 1)\n(76)\n\u03c0 m\u2212 R\nwhere we have used (63). This shows a somewhat milder dependence in R than in the case\nof a linear interaction between branes, given in Eq. (73), but still of power law form. In\nthe limit of large mass D\u2212 \u2248 exp(\u03c0m3\u2212 R3 /6), which as discussed before amounts to a finite\nrenormalization of the brane tension.\nAside from scalars, we should also consider the contributions from gauge bosons and\nfermions. For the case of a 3-sphere, these have been studied in [24]. For vectors of mass\nmA , the result is\n\u0013 Z mA R\n\u0012\n\u0012 2 \u0013\nsinh(\u03c0mA R)\nd\ng R\n1\n\u2212\n\u2212 log\ny 2 log(sinh \u03c0y)dy \u2212 \u03b6R\u2032 (\u22122) + 2\u03b6R\u2032 (0),\nWA = \u2212 log\n2\n2\n4\u03c0\n\u03c0mA R\ndy\n0\n(77)\nwhere g is the gauge coupling, which is dimensionful in three dimensions. When the branes\nare coincident, the theory is in the symmetric phase and the gauge bosons are massless.

Note\nthat the R dependence of the prefactor is simply as a power law. Here we have used the\nform (76) for the scalar contribution D\u2212 , corresponding to an attractive interaction amongst\nbranes which is quadratic at short distances, with a curvature of the potential characterized\nby some mass parameter m\u2212 2 . The prefactor in Eq. (82) has the exponential dependence\non k 2 which counts the number of worldsheet field degrees of freedom, while the Euclidean\naction Bk behaves approximately linearly with k. Hence, as suggested in [2], the prefactor\ncan be quite important in determining the nucleation rate.\nIn the scenario proposed in [2] it was also desirable that the enhancement in the nucleation\nrate would switch off at the present time, in order to prevent the vacuum from decaying\nfurther. Unfortunately, the expression (82) does not seem to have this property. The\nprefactor depends only on the radius R, which is itself a function of various parameters,\nsuch as the brane tension, the charge and the ambient expansion rate, as summarized in\nTable I. According to (82), an enhancement of the nucleation rate of coincident branes will\noccur for\n\u001a\n\u001b\n3\u03c3k \u22121 4Mp2\nR \u223c Min\n\u226a (g/m\u2212 )2 ,\n(83)\n, Ho ,\n\u01ebk\n\u03c3k\n\nwhere we have used the results of Table 1 in the first step. Consider first the situation\nwhere \u03c3k Mp\u22122 \u226a Ho . Note that even in the regime when R \u2248 H0\u22121 , the dependence of\nthe degeneracy factor on the corresponding dS temperature is only power law, and not\nexponential as suggested in [2]. Also, it is clear the stability of our vacuum is not guaranteed\nby the smallness of the present expansion rate. The enhancement will persist provided that\n\u03c3k /\u01ebk \u226a (g/m\u2212 )2 , even if the ambient de Sitter temperature vanishes. More worrisome is\nthe fact that for sufficiently large k we enter the regime where \u03c3k Mp\u22122 \u226b Ho . In that case,\nwe have\nR \u223c Mp2 /\u03c3k ,\nwhich can get smaller and smaller as we increase the number of coincident branes, eventually\nleading to a catastrophic decay rate, regardless of the value of Ho .\nThe expression (82) for the nucleation rate is valid for m\u2212 R \u226a 1. In the opposite limit,\nm\u2212 R \u226b 1, the scalars decouple, contributing a finite renormalization of the parameters in\nthe action (such as the brane tension and induced Newton's constant). For completeness,\nthis is discussed in Appendix A, where it is shown that the renormalization of parameters\ncan have a very significant impact on the nucleation rate.\nD.\n\nDiscussion: temperature of a vacuum bubble\n\nIn Ref. [2], the prefactor in the nucleation rate for the nucleation of coincident branes\nwas estimated as an entropy enhancement\nD \u223c eS ,\nwhere, from dimensional analysis, the entropy was estimated as S \u221d T 2 R2 per field degree of\nfreedom. The factor R2 is due to the area of the bubble, and T is some effective temperature.\n2\n\nIf we assume instead a linear interaction at short distances, we should use (73) and the behaviour changes\n2\nto D \u221d R(9/2)\u22122k , but in any case the dependence is still a power of the radius R\n\n\fAlthough the interpretation of the prefactor as the exponential of an entropy should not be\ntaken too literally, let us try and phrase the results of the previous subsection in this intuitive\nlanguage.\nA particle detector following a geodesic in a de Sitter space responds as if it was at rest\nin a thermal bath in flat space, at the temperature To = Ho /2\u03c0. It should be kept in\nmind, however, that the dS invariant quantum state is in fact a pure state, and hence rather\ndifferent from a true thermal state. For instance, any two detectors in geodesic relative\nmotion observe the same temperature, with a perfectly isotropic distribution. This is a\nconsequence of de Sitter invariance, and is in contrast with the situation in a thermal bath\nin flat space, where moving observers detect a temperature blue-shift in the direction of\ntheir motion relative to the bath.\nThe fields living on a nucleated brane will experience some thermal effects too. The\nbubble is embedded in a dS space characterized by a temperature To . The interior of the\nbubble is also a dS space characterized by a different expansion rate, with corresponding\ntemperature Ti . The existence of two different de Sitter spaces in contact with the brane led\nthe authors of Ref. [2] to consider two different possibilities for the effective temperature of\nthe fields on the brane: T = To and T = (To Ti )1/2 . However, there is in fact no ambiguity\nin the temperature of such fields [4], which is determined as follows.\nThe worldsheet of the brane is an S 3 of radius R, the Euclidean de Sitter space in 2+1\ndimensions. If interactions with bulk fields are neglected, brane fields are only sensitive to\nthe geometry of the worldsheet, and do not know about the properties of the ambient space.\nIn this approximation, the relevant temperature is clearly the intrinsic temperature of the\nlower dimensional de Sitter space,\nTR = 1/2\u03c0R.\n\n(84)\n\nThis conclusion remains unchanged when we include interactions with bulk fields. The\nsimplest way to see this, is to consider the limiting case where gravity can be ignored and\nthe nucleation takes place in a flat space. There, the ambient temperature vanishes To = 0,\nbut the fields on the brane will feel the temperature TR , because the nucleated brane expands\nwith constant acceleration a = 1/R. An accelerating observer in the Minkowski vacuum will\ndetect a Rindler temperature TR = a/2\u03c0, which happens to coincide with the intrinsic\nworldsheet temperature. Hence, the de Sitter vacuum in the 2+1 dimensional worldsheet is\nin equilibrium with the Minkowski vacuum in the bulk. This conclusion is quite general, and\napplies also to bubbles nucleating in de Sitter. The CdL instanton has an O(4) symmetry\nunder Euclidean rotations. This becomes an O(3, 1) symmetry after analytic continuation\ninto Lorentzian time. The quantum state after bubble nucleation is expected to inherit this\nsymmetry [5, 26, 27], and the only way to achieve it is if the fields on the brane are in their\nintrinsic de Sitter vacuum, which is characterized by temperature TR .\nNote that TR is a relatively high temperature. The radius of the instanton is always\nsmaller than Ho\u22121 (see Table 1), and therefore TR is strictly larger than To and Ti . Nevertheless, the product k 2 TR2 R2 \u223c k 2 , and hence the \"entropy enhancement\", is independent of\nthe ambient de Sitter temperature. As shown in the previous subsections, the independence\nof the prefactor D on the ambient expansion rate is only approximate, due to the anomalous\nbehaviour of light fields in de Sitter space. This introduces a dependence of the effective\naction Wef f = \u2212 log D on the radius R of the instanton (which in turn may depend on Ho\nin certain regimes). This dependence, however, is quite different from the one proposed in\n[2], where it was suggested that the nucleation rate of coincident branes would be enhanced\n\n\fat high Ho , and would switch off at low Ho due to the drop in ambient temperature. What\nwe find instead is that, if the CdL instanton for nucleation of coincident branes really exists,\nthen the corresponding degeneracy factor does not necessarily switch off.\nWe shall return to a discussion of this point in the concluding Section. Before that, let us\nturn our attention to a different instanton, which may be relevant to the FMSW scenario.\nVIII.\n\nPAIR CREATION OF CRITICAL BUBBLES\n\nEuclidean de Sitter space is compact in all spacetime directions, and (as we just discussed)\nit behaves in some respects as a system at finite temperature. One may then ask whether\nthere are instantons similar to the thermal ones in flat space. These correspond to static\nbubbles, in unstable equilibrium between expansion and collapse.\nStatic instantons with O(3) symmetry have previously been considered in a variety of\ncontexts, notably for the description of false vacuum decay in the presence of a black hole (See\ne.g. [28, 29] and references therein). The particular instanton we shall consider corresponds\nto pair creation of critical bubbles in de Sitter, and to our knowledge it does not seem to\nhave received much attention in the past. This is perhaps not surprising, since its action is\nhigher than the action for the maximally symmetric CdL instanton. However, if the CdL\ninstanton does not exist for coincident branes, the static one may turn out to be relevant\nonce the degeneracy factors are taken into account.\nA.\n\nThe instanton solution\n\nThe energy of a critical bubble is different from zero, and consequently, the metric outside\nof the bubble is no longer pure de Sitter, but Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS). The instanton\nis a solution of the Euclidean equations of motion, with two metrics glued together at the\nlocus of the wall, which is a surface of constant r in the static chart of SdS (see Fig. 6). The\nmetric outside is given by\nds2 = fo (r) dt2 + fo\u22121 (r) dr 2 + r 2 d\u03a92 ,\n\n(85)\n\nwhere d\u03a92 = d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 , and\nfo (r) =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n2GM\n2 2\n1\u2212\n\u2212 Ho r .\nr\n\n(86)\n\nThe metric inside is given by\nds2 = C 2 fi (r) dt2 + fi\u22121 (r) dr 2 + r 2 d\u03a92 ,\n\n(87)\n\n\u0001\nfi (r) = 1 \u2212 Hi2 r 2 ,\n\n(88)\n\n[Kab ] = \u22124\u03c0G\u03c3k \u03b3ab ,\n\n(89)\n\nwhere\ncorresponding to a de Sitter solution.

One of them, say\nr\u2212 , is negative and the other two are positive. The two positive roots correspond to the\nblack hole and cosmological horizons. We call them respectively rs and r+ . Therefore we\ncan write\nH2\n(96)\nfo (r) = \u2212 o (r \u2212 r\u2212 ) (r \u2212 rs ) (r \u2212 r+ ) .\nr\nOf course, in our instanton the horizon at rs is not present, since the exterior metric is\nmatched to an interior metric at some r = R > rs (see Fig. 6). For r < R the metric is just\na ball of de Sitter in the static chart, and it is regular down to the center of symmetry at\nr = 0. In general, the size of the cosmological horizon is given by\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2\n\u03c6+\u03c0\nHo r+ = \u221a cos\n,\n(97)\n3\n3\nwhere we have introduced the angle\n\u03c6 = \u2212 arctan\n\ns\n\n1\n27Ho2 M 2 G2\n\n\u2212 1,\n\n(98)\n\nIn the limit M \u2192 0 the angle \u03c6 \u2192 \u2212\u03c0/2, and Ho r+ \u2192 1.\nAccording to Eq (92), at the brane we have fo (R) = x2 (R \u2212 3GM)2 , so the equation\nfo (R) = 0 has a double zero instead of two different roots. This means that the radius of\nthe instanton will coincide with the radius of one of the horizons only in the special case\nwhere both horizons have the same size, rs = r+ = R = 3GM. In the limit rs = r+ the\n\u221a\n\u0001\u22121\nexterior metric becomes the Nariai solution [30, 31], which has r =\n3Ho .

As\nwe shall see, the Euclidean solution is periodic in the time direction, so that time runs on\na circle S 1 (See Fig. 6). The geometry at the time of nucleation is obtained by slicing the\ncompact instanton through a smooth spacelike surface which cuts the S 1 factor at two places,\nsay, t = 0 and t = \u03c0. The resulting geometry contains two different bubbles separated by a\ndistance comparable to the inverse expansion rate.\nB.\n\nTemperature and action\n\nIn order to calculate the temperature of the worldsheet in the static instanton we must\nfirst find the time periodicity \u03b2 . This is determined by the regularity of the Euclidean\nmetric at the cosmological horizon. For r \u2192 r+ , we have\n\u0012\n\u0013\nr\n2\nfo (r) \u2248 A 1 \u2212\n,\n(99)\nr+\nwhere\n2\nA2 = Ho2 (r+ \u2212 r\u2212 ) (r+ \u2212 rs ) = 3Ho2r+\n\u2212 1.\n\n(100)\n\nIn terms of the new coordinates\n\n2r+\n\u03c1=\nA\n\nr\nr\n1\u2212 ,\nr+\n\n\u03c6=\n\nA2\nt,\n2r+\n\n(101)\n\n\fthe metric (85) for r \u2192 r+ reads\n2\nds2 = \u03c12 d\u03c62 + d\u03c12 + r+\nd\u03a92 ,\n\n(102)\n\nso it is clear that \u03c6 is an angle, 0 \u2264 \u03c6 \u2264 2\u03c0, and t varies in the range 0 \u2264 t \u2264 4\u03c0r+ /A2 .\nTherefore the value of \u03b2 is\n\u03b2=\n\n2\n2\u03c0r+\n4\u03c0r+\n=\n.\n2\n3Ho2r+\n\u22121\nr+ \u2212 3GM\n\n(103)\n\nThe\ntemperature of the worldsheet instanton is given by the proper time periodicity \u03b2R \u2261\nR \u03b2 1/2\n1/2\n1/2\nf (R) dt = fo (R) \u03b2 = Cfi (R) \u03b2.

This is derived in Appendix B, where it is shown that the difference\nin Euclidean actions between the instanton and the background solutions is given by\nB=\n\nC.\n\n\u0001\n\u03c0\n2\n2\n1\n\u2212\nr\nH\n+ o .\nGHo2\n\n(105)\n\nSome limiting cases\n\nLet us start with the case of low tension branes, \u03c3k /Mp2 \u226a Ho , Ho \u2212 Hi . In this case the\nparameter x is large compared with Ho , R \u2243 x\u22121 is small, and GMHo \u226a 1. In this limit\nthe angle \u03c6 in Eq. (98) is close to \u2212\u03c0/2 and Ho r+ \u2243 1. We have\nB\u2243\n\n2\u03c0 16\u03c0\u03c3k3\n,\nHo 3\u01eb2\n\n\u03b2R \u2243\n\n2\u03c0\n.\nHo\n\n(106)\n\nThis is just the flat space expression for the energy of a critical bubble, multiplied by\nEuclidean time periodicity of the low curvature de Sitter space in which this bubble is\nembedded.\nNext, we may consider the case of intermediate tension Ho \u2212 Hi \u226a \u03c3k /Mp2 \u226a Ho , Hi . In\n\u221a\n\u221a\nthis case, x \u2248 Hi / 2, R \u2248 ( 3x)\u22121 , Ho r+ \u2248 1 \u2212 GMHo , with GMHo \u226a 1, and we have\n16\u03c0 2 \u03c3k\nB\u2248 \u221a\n,\n3 3 Ho3\n\n2\u03c0\n\u03b2R \u2248 \u221a\n.\n3Ho\n\n(107)\n\nIn this case, the difference in pressure between inside and outside of the brane is insignificant\ncompared with the brane tension term, which is balanced against collapse by the cosmological\nexpansion.\nFinally, in the limit of very large \u03c3k we find that 3GM becomes larger than R, namely,\n3GM \u2192 4R/3. This means that fo (R) vanishes for some value \u03c3k = \u03c3max , given below\nin Eq. (118), so it is not sensible to consider the limit of very large \u03c3k but just the limit\n\u03c3k \u2192 \u03c3max . As we have mentioned [see the discussion below Eq. (96)], the exterior metric\n\n\f\u221a\n\u0001\u22121\nin this limit corresponds to the Nariai solution, with rs = r+ =\n3Ho . Replacing this\nvalue in (105) we find readily\n2\u03c0\nB=\n.\n(108)\n3GHo2\nIt is interesting to compare this value of B with the corresponding one for the nucleation of\nblack holes in the same de Sitter universe. This is described by the Nariai instanton [30],\nwhich has the bounce action\n\u03c0\n.\n(109)\nBN =\n3GHo2\nNote that the difference B \u2212 BN = \u03c0/3GHo2 = Abh /4G, where Abh = 4\u03c0rs2 is the area of the\nblack hole horizon in the Nariai solution. Hence, the probability of nucleating black holes\ndivided by the probability of nucleating brane configurations characterized by the same\nmass parameter is just the exponential of the black hole entropy, as expected from general\nconsiderations (In this argument, we are of course neglecting the entropy stored in the field\ndegrees of freedom living on the branes, which will only show up when the determinantal\nprefactor in the nucleation rate is evaluated).\nLet us consider the value of \u03b2R in the limit \u03c3k \u2192 \u03c3max . This is a singular limit in Eq.\n(104) due to the simultaneous vanishing of numerator and denominator. Thus we will need\nto change to more appropriate coordinates. The fact that rs = r+ does not mean, though,\nthat both horizons coincide, since the coordinates r, t become inadequate in this case. Near\nthis limit the metric outside takes the form (85), with\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u00132\nr\nr\n2\nfo (r) \u2248 A 1 \u2212\n\u2212 1\u2212\n,\n(110)\nr+\nr+\nand r \u2248 r+ , plus higher orders in A. The\n\u221a constant A is the same parameter defined in (100),\n2\nbut in this limit tends to zero, A = 3Ho (r+ \u2212 rs ). Now we define new coordinates \u03c8 and\n\u03bb by\n\u0013\n\u0012\nA2\nr\n2\n, \u03bb=\nt,\n(111)\ncos \u03c8 = 1 \u2212 2 1 \u2212\nA\nr+\n2\nso that the metric becomes\n2\n2\nds2 = sin2 \u03c8 d\u03bb2 + r+\nd\u03c8 2 + r+\nd\u03a92 .\n\n(112)\n\nIn these coordinates the cosmological horizon is at \u03c8 = 0 and the black hole horizon is at\n\u221a\n\u0001\u22121\n\u03c8 = \u03c0. Now in the limit A \u2192 0 we just replace r+ =\n3Ho .\nWe must determine the position \u03c8R of the brane, which is given as before by the matching\nconditions (89), where now the metric outside is (112). So, on the brane, we have\n2\nds2\u03c3k = sin2 \u03c8R d\u03bb2 + r+\nd\u03a92\n\u20322\n\n2\n\n2\n\n= fi (R) dt + R d\u03a9\n\n(113)\n(114)\n\nand the extrinsic curvature on the outside of the brane is \u2212(1/2)\u2202\u03c8 gab , with g00 = sin2 \u03c8\n2\nand g\u03a9\u03a9 = r+\n, i.e., K00 = \u2212(1/r+ )g00 cot \u03c8, K\u03a9\u03a9 = 0. The curvature inside is as before\n1/2\n1/2\nK00 = g00 \u2202r fi and K\u03a9\u03a9 = g\u03a9\u03a9 fi /r, with fi (r) = (1 \u2212 Hi2r 2 ), so the Israel conditions\ngive\n\u0010\n\u0011\u2032\n1\n1/2\ncot \u03c8R \u2212 fi\n|R = \u22124\u03c0G\u03c3k ,\n(115)\n\u2212\nr+\n1/2\n\nfi\n\n(R) /R = 4\u03c0G\u03c3k .\n\n(116)\n\n\fThese equations are easily solved and give\nsin \u03c8R\n\u03c3k = \u03c3max\n\n\u00131/2\n3Ho2 \u2212 Hi2\n,\n=\n6Ho2 \u2212 Hi2\nq\n= 2Mp2 3Ho2 \u2212 Hi2\n\u0012\n\n(117)\n(118)\n\n\u221a\nso Hi must be less than 3Ho . Now regularity at the cosmological horizon \u03c8 \u2243 0 implies\nthat 0 \u2264 \u03bb/r+ \u2264 2\u03c0, so \u03b2R = sin (\u03c8R ) 2\u03c0r+ . Hence,\n2\u03c0\n\u03b2R = \u221a\n3Ho\n\n\u0012\n\n3Ho2 \u2212 Hi2\n6Ho2 \u2212 Hi2\n\n\u00131/2\n\n.\n\n(119)\n\nThus, also in this case, the effective temperature of the field degrees of freedom living on\nthe worldsheet will be of order H0 or higher.\nD.\n\nThe prefactor for static instantons\n\nIn flat space, and at finite temperature T \u226b \u01ebk /\u03c3k , the instanton which is relevant for\nvacuum decay is static and spherically symmetric in the spatial directions. The fluctuations\nare periodic in Euclidean time, with periodicity \u03b2 = 1/T . The worldsheet of the brane has\nthe topology S 1 \u00d7 S 2 , where the S 1 is the direction of imaginary time, and the S 2 is the\nboundary of the \"critical\" bubble, a closed brane in unstable equilibrium between expansion\nand collapse (this is in contrast with the zero temperature instanton, where the world-sheet\nis a 3-sphere.) The radius of the critical bubble is given by\nR\u03b2 =\n\n2\u03c3k\n,\n\u01ebk\n\nand the difference of the instanton action and the action for the background is given by\nB\u03b2 = \u03b2E (0) ,\nwhere E (0) = (4\u03c0/3)\u03c3k R\u03b22 is the classical energy of the critical bubble. The one loop quantum\ncorrection can be written as (see e.g. [32])\nW\u03a6 = \u03b2F\u03a6 = \u03b2(E\u03a6 \u2212 T S\u03a6 )\n\n(120)\n\nHere, F\u03a6 denotes the free energy and E\u03a6 is the correction to the energy of the critical bubble\ndue to the field \u03a6. This includes the zero point energy of \u03a6 in the presence of the bubble,\nas well as the thermal contributions. Finally, S\u03a6 is the entropy. Thus, the nucleation rate\ntakes the form\n2\n\u0393\u03b2 = De\u2212B\u03b2 \u223c e\u2212(B\u03b2 +k W\u03a6 ) \u223c e\u2212\u03b2F \u223c e\u2212E/T eS ,\n\nwhere E = E (0) + k 2 E\u03a6 is the total energy, F = E (0) + k 2 F\u03a6 is the total free energy and\nS = k 2 S\u03a6 is the total entropy. Thus, for thermal instantons the determinant prefactor does\nindeed include the exponential of the entropy. This is, however, not the only role of the\nprefactor, since there is also some correction to the energy of the bubble.\n\n\fConsider, for simplicity a massless field \u03a6. At sufficiently high temperature T \u226b R\u03b2\u22121 ,\nthe entropy behaves as S\u03a6 \u221d T 2 R\u03b22 . From S\u03a6 = \u2212\u2202F\u03a6 /\u2202T , it follows that F\u03a6 \u2248 \u2212T S\u03a6 /3.\nHence\n2\n\u0393\u03b2 = De\u2212B\u03b2 \u223c e\u2212B\u03b2 e+k S\u03a6 /3 .\nIn this case, the prefactor clearly represents an \"entropy enhancement\". On the other hand,\nat lower temperatures, it is not clear whether the prefactor represents an enhancement or\na suppression. At temperatures comparable to R\u03b2\u22121 , the vacuum energy term can be as\nimportant as the thermal contributions, and the logarithm of the prefactor D can have\neither sign.\nThe case of the static instanton in de Sitter space is somewhat close to this low temperature situation, and without an explicit calculation it is not clear whether the prefactor\nrepresents an enhancement or a suppression of the nucleation rate. An interesting possibility would be that at sufficiently high Gibbons-Hawking temperature To \u223c Ho , the thermal\ncontribution may be sufficient to restore the symmetry, creating the desired attractive force\namongst the branes. This is currently under research.\nThe static instanton presented in this Section may perhaps be better suited to the scenario proposed by Feng et al. [2], than the Coleman-de Luccia instanton. Ignoring the\ndegeneracy factors, the action of the static instanton is always larger than the action of\nthe CdL instanton. In this sense, it seems to correspond to a subdominant decay channel.\nHowever, as we have discussed in previous Sections, it might well be that the CdL instanton\nfor multiple brane nucleation simply does not exist because of the repulsive force amongst\nthe branes. This does not exclude the possibility that in the case of the static thermal instantons the symmetry is restored at high ambient (and worldsheet) dS temperature \u223c H0 .\nIn this situation, the decay through nucleation of coincident branes would only be possible\nthrough the static instanton 3 . At low Ho , the thermal contribution might not be sufficient\nto restore the symmety and stacks of branes may simply not hold together, destroying the\npossibility of further decay by coincident brane nucleation. Also, the prefactor and the\nEuclidean action have an exponential dependence on the ambient temperature \u223c Ho , and\ncan be much suppressed at the present epoch, contributing to the stability of the present\nvacuum (in contrast with the Coleman-de Luccia case).\nE.\n\nAn entropy bound\n\nA potentially worrying aspect of coincident brane nucleation in the CdL case is whether\nthe degeneracy factor may grow without bound as we increase the number of branes [2].\nAs we have seen, this will not happen for the case of the static instanton discussed in this\nsection, since nucleation of coincident branes cannot involve arbitrarily large k. Indeed,\nthere is a maximum value of the combined tension of the branes \u03c3k \u226a \u03c3max \u223c Mp2 Ho , given\nin Eq. (118), beyond which the instanton simply does not exist. In this limit, the metric\noutside of the branes approaches the Nariai solution.\nFrom this observation, we can easily derive a bound on the maximum entropy which can\nbe stored in the stack of branes. Indeed, the static instanton represents a spherical bubble\nin unstable equilibrium between undeterred expansion or collapse into a black hole. The\n3\n\nIn the weak coupling limit, we have checked that indeed the U (k) symmetry is not restored in the case of\nthe CdL instanton [24].\n\n\fentropy can only increase when the stack of branes collapses, and hence the entropy of the\ncoincident branes cannot exceed the entropy of the Nariai black hole. The stack of branes\nwith tension \u03c3k \u2192 \u03c3max has the same radius as the horizon of the Nariai black hole, and\nso, the entropy of the stack of branes is bounded by one fourth of its own area, in natural\nunits. A corollary is that the nucleation rate of coincident branes in the limit \u03c3k \u2192 \u03c3max is\nbounded above by the nucleation rate of Nariai black holes of the same mass.\nIX.\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION\n\nIn this paper we have investigated the possibility of coincident brane nucleation by a\nfour-form field, in connection with string motivated scenarios for the neutralization of the\neffective cosmological constant.\nIn four dimensions, and after the moduli are stabilized, the branes repel each other at\ndistances larger than the inverse mass of the moduli. At shorter distances, their interactions\nwill be model dependent, but in the simplest models the branes do not attract at the classical\nlevel. In this situation, it is unclear whether the Coleman-de Luccia (CdL) instanton for\nnucleation of coincident branes really contributes to the semiclassical decay rate, since it\nwould have too many zero modes and negative modes.\nAssuming that the CdL instanton exists for the nucleation of coincident branes (that is,\nassuming an attractive short range interaction amongst the branes in the stack), we have\ninvestigated the degeneracy factor accompanying the formula for the nucleation rate, due\nto the large number of worldsheet degrees of freedom. We have modeled such degrees of\nfreedom by a weakly coupled SYM U(k) gauge theory, which is unbroken when the branes\nare coincident. We find that the degeneracy factor does not depend very strongly on the\nambient de Sitter (dS) temperatures before or after the nucleation event. Rather, it depends\nonly on the radius of the instanton. Hence the degeneracy factors can be quite important\neven when the ambient dS temperature is as low as it is today. This may indicate that\nnucleation of coincident branes via the CdL instanton is in fact impossible, otherwise the\npresent vacuum would immediately decay.\nIf the CdL instanton for coincident branes does not exist, stacks of branes may still\nnucleate through a \"static\" instanton which represents pair creation of critical bubbles, in\nunstable equilibrium between expansion and collapse. This is the analog of the instanton\nfor thermal activation in flat space. Despite the absence of a classical attractive force, the\nbranes could be held together by thermal corrections to the interbrane potential, which tend\nto favor the symmetric phase (where branes are on top of each other). The calculation of\nthis thermal effective potential for the static instanton is currently under research. One may\nask whether a similar symmetry restoration may not happen for the CdL instanton. In this\ncase the calculation has been done in [24], where it is shown that the one loop potential does\nnot help restoring the symmetry. So it is conceivable that the branes may stick together for\nthe static instanton but not for the CdL instanton, in which case the former would be the\nrelevant decay channel.\nTo conclude, we have presented some evidence that the \"saltatory\" relaxation scenario\nof [2] may be difficult to implement via the CdL instanton, since saltation would be hard\nto stop at present. Rather, we have speculated that it may be easier to implement through\nthe static instanton. In the scenarios proposed in Ref. [2] for the saltatory relaxation of the\ncosmological constant, two different possibilities were suggested for the effective temperature\nof the worldsheet degrees of freedom, namely T1 \u223c Ho and T2 \u223c (Ho Hi )1/2 , where Hi and\n\n\fHo are the expansion rates before and after nucleation. We have shown that for the static\ninstanton, the relevant temperature is comparable to the ambient de Sitter temperature \u223c Ho\nbefore the tunneling. Hence, the nucleation rate of coincident branes would be unsupressed\nat large ambient de Sitter temperature, but exponentially suppressed at present, which is of\ncourse desirable.\nClearly, many issues need to be addressed before a scenario based on coincident brane\nnucleation can be used to successfully explain the smallness of the observed cosmological\nconstant. A considerable advance would be to understand why the large \u039bef f relaxes to\nthe small \u039bobs instead of plunging directly into deep AdS space (the latter jump involves a\nlarger number of coincident branes and would be rewarded by a larger degeneracy factor).\nIn Ref. [2] an explanation was offered, based on a \"uniquely weak\" form of the anthropic\nprinciple. As explained in Section II, any relaxation mechanism requires the gap \u2206\u039b in\nthe discretuum of \u039bef f not to be much larger than \u039bobs (otherwise it becomes a problem\nto understand why, accidentally, there happens to be an allowed vacumm so close to zero,\nat \u039bef f = \u039bobs \u226a \u2206\u039b). In [2] it was proposed that \u2206\u039b = a\u039bobs with a \u223c 1, saturating\nthe above requirement. Then the allowed \u039bef f would take values in the sequence ..., (1 \u2212\na)\u039bobs , \u039bobs , (1+a)\u039bobs , (1+2a)\u039bobs , .... If we start from a large \u039bef f , then the enhancement\nof brane nucleation for large k favours a jump to the lowest value in the above list which is\nstill compatible with the existence of observers. FMSW suggested that the value (1 \u2212 a)\u039bobs\nmay already be too small for observers to emerge, making the vacuum with the value \u039bobs\nthe favourite destination.\nFinally, one should try to embed this scenario in a cosmological context, taking into\naccount the restrictions imposed by homogeneity and isotropy. If unsuppressed saltation\nhappened after inflation, then we would have seen signals of it in the microwave background. Indeed, bubbles which nucleate after thermalization are still rather small at the\ntime of decoupling, and we would see different domains with different values of \u039bef f separated by fast moving stacks of branes, which would presumably cause large perturbations\nin the gravitational potential. Hence, saltation should occur during inflation, and switch\noff somewhat before the end of it. This may impose certain constraints on the space of\nparameters such as the tension and charges of the branes, or alternatively, on the ambient\ntemperature below which the instanton with coincident branes simply does not exist (e.g.\nbecause thermal symmetry restoration is no longer effective). Also, it should be clarified\nwhat might be the advantages of a saltatory \"neutralization\" scenario over the \"randomization\" scenarios discussed in Section II. A possible advantage is that saltatory relaxation\noperates very quickly, and hence it does not require eternal inflation to take place (as required in the randomization scenarios). A fuller discussion of these issues is left for further\nresearch.\nAcknowledgements\n\nJ.G. is grateful Roberto Emparan and Alex Vilenkin for very useful discussions.

For completeness,\nhere we shall discuss the limit m\u2212 R \u226b 1. In this case the heavy degrees of freedom decouple,\nand they simply contribute a finite renormalization of the parameters in front of different\noperators in the classical Lagrangian.\nFor scalar fields we have\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\n(A1)\nW\u2212 = \u2212 m3\u2212 R3 + m\u2212 R + ...\n6\n4\nAs discussed in Section VII, the first term in this expansion corresponds to a finite renormalization of the brane tension, multiplied by the worldvolume of the stack of branes. The\nsecond term correspond to a finite renormalization of the coefficient in front of the worldsheet Ricci scalar. This term was not present in the classical action we started with, but\nevidently it can be generated by quantum corrections. The scalar contribution (A1) tends\nto decrease the tension of the stack of branes. This tends to favour the nucleation rate at\nlarge m\u2212 R, as represented in Fig. 5. However, whether an actual enhancement really occurs\nwill be model dependent, since all massive species, and not just the scalars, contribute finite\nrenormalizations of the parameters in the action. In Section VII we have assumed that there\nis an attractive short range force amongst the branes, which we have modeled as a mass\nterm for the scalars representing the relative positions of the branes. One may expect that\nthe same mechanism which generates a potential for the scalars may generate masses also\nfor their fermionic partners. From (79), heavy fermions give a contribution to the effective\npotential of the form\n1\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\nW\u03a8 = + m3\u03a8 R3 + m\u03a8 R + ... (m\u03a8 R \u226b 1)\n(A2)\n2\n6\n8\nper degree of freedom. This gives a positive renormalization of the brane tension (which\ntends to suppress the nucleation rate). In the special case where m\u2212 = m\u03a8 , the brane tension\ndoes not renormalize, but each pair of fields will still contribute a finite renormalization of the\nsubleading term \u2206W = (3\u03c0/8)m\u2212 R which would suppress the nucleation rate. Generically,\nhowever, scalars and fermions may wind up with different masses (since supersymmetry is\nbroken at some level), and the tension will be renormalized. Dividing the leading term\nin W by the worldvolume Vol[S 3 ] = 2\u03c0 2 R3 , each scalar and fermionic degree of freedom\ncontributes a brane tension renormalization of the form\nm3 \u2212 m3\u2212\n\u2206\u03c3 \u2248 \u03a8\n.\n(A3)\n12\u03c0\nSimilarly, there will be a renormalization of the induced Newton's constant GN on the\nworldsheet, of the order \u2206G\u22121\nN \u223c (m\u03a8 \u2212 m\u2212 ) for each pair of heavy field species. These\nchanges will modify the instanton solution. For k coincident branes, the number of such\nfields grows as k 2 , and the effect of these finite renormalizations can be quite dramatic. The\nnucleation rate will take the form\n\u0393k \u223c \u03c3 2 R2 (Ag 2 R)k\n\n2 /2\n\nren\n\ne\u2212Bk\n\n(m\u2212 R \u226b 1).\n\n(A4)\n\nwhere A \u223c 1 is a constant which depends on whether some (or all) of the fermionic species\nhave decoupled or not. The bounce action Bkren in the exponent is calculated by using the\nrenormalized values of the parameters. If \u2206\u03c3 < 0, then the renormalized tension \u03c3k \u223c\nk\u03c3 + (k 2 \u2212 1)\u2206\u03c3 sharply decreases for large k, leading to unsuppressed tunneling rate. On\nthe contrary, for \u2206\u03c3 > 0 the nucleation of coincident branes is strongly suppressed.\n\n\fAPPENDIX B: EUCLIDEAN ACTION FOR THE STATIC INSTANTON\n\nThe action is given by\nSE (I) = \u03c3\n\nZ\n\n\u221a\nd \u03be \u03b3+\n3\n\nZ\n\n\u0012\n\u221a\nd x g \u03c1V \u2212\n4\n\n\u0013\nR\n.\n16\u03c0G\n\n(B1)\n\nOn shell, the scalar curvature is given by,\n\u221a\n\u221a\nR g = 32\u03c0G\u03c1V g + 24\u03c0G\u03c3\n\nZ\n\n\u221a\nd3 \u03be \u03b3\u03b4 (4) (x \u2212 x (\u03be)) ,\n\nand hence the instanton action is given by\nZ\nZ\n\u03c3\n\u221a\n3 \u221a\nd \u03be \u03b3 \u2212 d4 x\u03c1V g.\nSE (I) = \u2212\n2\n\n(B2)\n\n(B3)\n\nThe first integral in (B3) is just the volume of a two-sphere of radius R times \u03b2R .
