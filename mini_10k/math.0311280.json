Introduction: This paper addresses questions about exponential functionals of\nBrownian motion and the integral of geometric Brownian motion in particular. These\nquestions reduce to the study of the quadratic variation processes A(\u03bd) of geometric\nBrownian motion which for any real drift \u03bd are explicitly given by the integrals over\ntime\nZ t\n(\u03bd)\ne2(\u03bdw+Bw ) dw ,\nt \u2208 [0, \u221e)\nAt =\n0\n\nwith B a standard Brownian motion. These processes have both a surprisingly rich theory and manifold applications ranging from the physics of random media to mathematical finance and insurance. In fact, the insurance motivated study of certain perpetuities\nin [Du90] seems to have initiated this line of research. Here, the above integrals over the\nwhole time axis are considered and shown to be distributed as the reciprocals of certain\ngamma variables. Drawing on his probabilistic interpretation of the Hartman-Watson\nidentities in [Y80], Yor was able to extend this work and to determine the law of the\nprocesses A(\u03bd) in [Y]. This approach, using the Laplace transform and based on Bessel\nprocesses, has been found by Yor to open many surprising vistas on the processes A(\u03bd)\nand their applications, see in particular [Y01]. The interest in these processes A(\u03bd) is\n\n\f2\n\nP. Carr and M. Schr\u00f6der\n\npartially due to their importance in mathematical finance, in particular for understanding the so-called Asian options.\nAsian options are widely used financial derivatives. As discussed in Part I of the paper,\nthese options provide in general nonlinear payoffs on the arithmetic average of the\nprice of an underlying asset. A common objective in their valuation is to derive an\nexplicit expression for a certain functional of A(\u03bd) . The pursuit of this objective has\nevolved over the last fifteen years as an interplay between theoretical and computational\nperspectives, see [RS] or [Du00] for instance. Yor's work in [Y] clarified the structure of\nthe Black-Scholes prices of Asian options by expressing them as certain triple integrals.\nIn contrast to this result, however, it was the Laplace transform approach of [GY], also\nbased on Hartman-Watson theory, which had far reaching consequences for the way\nAsian option valuation is seen today, and on which we focus here from Part II onwards.\nThis is essentially because a very explicit expression in terms of Kummer's confluent\nhypergeometric function resulted from this approach for what has been regarded as\nthe Laplace transform of the value of such options. From a numerical point of view,\nthis expression has proved to be amenable to computation by numerical inversion,\nsee [FMW] as a recent example. And it seems fair to say that this has lead financial\nmathematics to a new interest in developing and applying these techniques.\nUnfortunately, some difficulties with this Laplace transform approach to valuing Asian\noptions have emerged. First, it turned out that the Laplace transforms computed in\n[GY] are not those of the Asian option's value. This appeared to empty the relevance\nof this result for the finance application proper. Luckily, it turned out that there is\na reduction of the original problem of valuing Asian options to the one considered in\n[GY]. All of this is discussed in Part II of the paper.\nA difficulty of a more serious and more principal nature, however, originates with the\nHartman-Watson approach on which the Laplace transform computations of [GY] are\nbased. Its idea is to analyze A(\u03bd) using Bessel processes of indices \u03bd, and its applicability\nhas limits if \u03bd is negative because of the pathologies which Bessel processes of such\nnegative indices develop. Together with background material about Bessel processes,\nwe have thus given in Part III a new exposition of the analysis in [GY], which explicitly takes care of the nonnegativity restriction on the index \u03bd. Hereby, we have been\nencouraged by the kind support of Yor, and we have tried to incorporate his kind\ntutorials and suggestions. In terms of financial mathematics, our extension to negative\n\u03bd in fact extends the analysis of Asian options from the zero dividend situation originally\nconsidered in [GY] to one of general real dividend yields, and thus to one with general\nreal risk-neutral drifts. In this setting, the condition that \u03bd is not negative transcribes\ninto the postulate that risk-neutral drift is not less than half the squared volatility.\nUnfortunately, this lower bound on the drift restricts the financial applicability of the\nresults. In fact, the greater is the volatility, the greater is the range of parameters in\nwhich the nonnegativity condition on \u03bd is violated and in which the approach does not\ngive the Laplace transforms. Unfortunately, it is precisely due to high volatility of the\nunderlying asset that Asian options are used in the first place.\n\n\fBessel Processes and Asian options\n\n3\n\nThus, the third contribution of our paper is to remove these restrictions by showing\nthe existence of the desired Laplace transforms. In fact, we develop three ways for\nremoving these restrictions. More precisely, we develop three princpal ways of coping\nwith the difficulties caused by Bessel processes of negative indices in the HartmanWatson approach. This can be seen as the main mathematical contribution of the\npaper. The approaches of Parts IV and VI are based on an analysis of Bessel processes\nin the spirit of Yor. Our first approach extends the [GY] analysis to the missing cases\nusing deeper properties of Bessel processes of negative indices. Our second approach\ngives a new uniform proof using zero index Bessel processes only. Our third approach\nof Part V extends that of [CS] and merges stochastic with complex analytic techniques.\nThis appears to be a rather novel and promising line of attack as we are able to largely\ndispense with Bessel processes and focus instead on Brownian motion.\nApart from all this, our extension of the Laplace transform approach of [GY] has made\npossible advances in valuing Asian options, some of which are sketched in Part VII.\nHence, it may be fair to say that the Laplace transform approach of [GY] has proved\nto be a rich source for new results and insights in both finance and mathematics.\n\nI\n\nPrologue\n\n2. Black-Scholes modelling: The results to be discussed originate from the socalled risk-neutral approach to the valuation of contingent claims. General equilibrium\ntreatments for this and other notions developed for the analysis of financial markets and\ninstruments are in [D88], [D96], [KS, Chapters 1\u20134], for instance. This analysis is based\non models of security markets, and this section aims to recall the most fundamental of\nthese, the Black-Scholes model of security markets.\nIn fact, we need only that particular case of the Black-Scholes model where there are\nonly two securities, and the understanding is that these are traded on markets where\ntheir prices are determined by equating demand and supply. First, there is a riskless\nsecurity, a bond, whose price \u03b2 grows at the continuously compounding positive interest\nrate r, i.e., for which we have we have \u03b2t = exp(rt) at any time t \u2208 [0, \u221e). Then, there\nis a risky security. The fundamental idea is that all uncertainties affecting its price S\nyield a certain probability space. In fact, consider for this a complete probability space\nequipped with the standard filtration of a standard Brownian motion on the time set\n[0, \u221e). Giving expression to the fact that S comes as an equilibrium price, we have the\nrisk neutral measure Q on this filtered space, a probability measure equivalent to the\ngiven one. And with B any standard Q-Brownian motion, the exact modelling then is\nthat S is the strong solution of the following stochastic differential equation:\ndSt = \u031f * St * dt + \u03c3 * St * dBt ,\n\nt \u2208 [0, \u221e) ,\n\nor equivalently using It\u00f4 calculus, St = S0 exp((\u031f\u2212\u03c3 2 /2)t+\u03c3Bt ), for all t in [0, \u221e). The\npositive constant \u03c3 is the volatility of S. The specific form of the otherwise arbitrary\nconstant \u031f depends on the nature of the security modelled which could be a stock, a\ncurrency, a commodity etc. For example, if S is the price of a stock paying a dividend\ncontinuously so as to have constant dividend yield \u03b4, then we have \u031f = r\u2212\u03b4.\n\n\f4\n\nP. Carr and M. Schr\u00f6der\n\n3. Asian options and their equilibrium pricing: In the Black-Scholes framework\nof \u00a72, fix any time t0 and consider the process J given for any time t by:\nZ t\nJ(t) =\nSu du ,\nt0\n\nThe arithmetic-average Asian option written at time t0 with maturity T and strike\nprice K is then the stochastic process on the closed time interval from t0 to T paying\n\u001a\n\u0013\n\u001b\n\u0012\nJ(T )\nJ(T )\n+\n= max 0,\n\u2212K\n\u2212K\nT \u2212 t0\nT \u2212 t0\n\nat time T and paying nothing at all other times. As such it is a contingent claim on\nthe time interval from t0 to T with payoff (J(T )/(T \u2212t0 ) \u2212 K)+ .\nIt is one of the fundamental insights that in the the equilibrium framework of the\nBlack-Scholes model, any such contingent claim on a risky security has an equilibrium\nprice which is equal to the discounted expectation of its payoff with respect to the risk\nneutral measure conditional on today's information, see [D88, \u00a722K, (47)], [D96, \u00a78A]\nor [MR, Corollary 5.1.1], for instance. Applying this arbitrage pricing principle, the\nprice Ct of the Asian option at any time t between t0 and T is given by the discounted\nQ-expectation conditional on the information F t available at time t:\n#\n\"\u0012\n\u0013+\nJ(T\n)\nFt .\nCt = e\u2212r(T \u2212t) E Q\n\u2212K\nT \u2212 t0\nHowever, following [GY, \u00a73.2], we do not focus on this price, but instead we normalize\nthe valuation problem as follows. On factoring out the reciprocal of the length T \u2212 t0\nof the time period, we split the integral J(T ) into two integrals, one of which is deterministic by time t and the other of which is random. We then couple the deterministic\nintegral with the new strike. For the random integral, we restart the Brownian motion\ndriving the underlying at time t, and then using the scaling property of Brownian motion, we change time so as to normalize its coefficient in the new time scale to two. The\nprecise result is the factorization:\nCt =\n\ne\u2212r(T \u2212t) 4St\n* 2 * C (\u03bd) (h, q) ,\nT \u2212 t0\n\u03c3\n\nwhich reduces the general valuation problem to computing\n\u0003\n\u0002 (\u03bd)\nC (\u03bd) (h, q) = E Q (Ah \u2212 q)+ ,\n\nthe normalized time-t price of the Asian option. Herein, A(\u03bd) is Yor's process\nZ h\n(\u03bd)\ne2(Bw +\u03bdw) dw ,\nAh =\n0\n\nand the normalized parameters are as follows:\n\u03bd=\n\n2\u031f\n\u2212 1,\n\u03c32\n\nh=\n\n\u03c32\n(T \u2212 t),\n4\n\nq = kh+q \u2217 ,\n\n\fBessel Processes and Asian options\nwhere\nK\nk= ,\nSt\n\n\u03c32\nq = q (t) =\n4St\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\n\u0012\n\nK * (t\u2212t0 ) \u2212\n\nZ\n\n5\nt\n\n\u0013\n\nSu du .\nt0\n\nTo interpret these quantities, \u03bd is the normalized adjusted interest rate, h is the normalized time to maturity, which is non-negative, and q is the normalized strike price.\nOn a conceptual level, notice that valuing any Asian option in this way is reduced to\ncomputing a single function C (\u03bd) , and that a similar notion of normalized hedging of\nAsian options can be developed along these lines. On a structural level, moreover notice\nhow q becomes affine linear in the time variable h with coefficients k and q \u2217 depending\nonly on quantities known at time t.\n\n4. A first reduction of the normalized valuation: There is now a dichotomy in\ncomputing the normalized time-t price\n\u0002 (\u03bd)\n\u0001+ \u0003\nC (\u03bd) (h, q) = E Q Ah \u2212 q\n\nof the Asian option according to the normalized strike price q being positive or not.\nIndeed, if q is non-positive, Asian options lose their option feature. Computing the\nvalues C (\u03bd) (h, q) is straightforward:\nLemma: If q \u2264 0, we have\nwith\n\nh\ni\n(\u03bd)\nC (\u03bd) (h, q) = E Q Ah \u2212 q .\ni e2h(\u03bd+1) \u2212 1\nh\n(\u03bd)\n,\nE Q Ah =\n2(\u03bd +1)\n\nfor any real \u03bd, and it is thus sufficient to compute C (\u03bd) (h, q) if q > 0.\nThis can be proved on applying Fubini's theorem, and the last expectation is seen to be\nanalytic in \u03bd with its value at \u03bd = \u22121 equal to h. It should be mentioned that formulas\nfor all moments of A(\u03bd) have been derived at various instances over the last fifty years,\nsee for example [Y01, \u00a72.4.1, (4.d'), p.33 and Postscript #3b), p.54].\n\n5. Yor's integral representation for Asian option values: A closed form for the\nnormalized time-t prices C (\u03bd) of Asian options can be obtained as a consequence of\nYor's triple integral representation [Y, (6.e), p.528]. Recall the latter is based on Yor's\ncharacterization of the law of A(\u03bd) in [Y, (6.c), p.527] and so is eventually based on the\nHartman-Watson theory of [Y80]. Furnishing a measure for the difficulty of computing\nnormalized prices, the precise form of Yor's closed form is as follows\nTheorem: For any reals h, q > 0 and \u03bd, we have\nZ \u221e Z \u221e (1+x2 )y \u0010\n\u0011+\n1\n\u2212\n2\n\u2212q * \u03c8xy (h) dy dx .\n*\nx\u03bd\ne\nC (\u03bd) (h, q) = c\u03bd,h\ny\n0\n0\n\n\f6\n\nP. Carr and M. Schr\u00f6der\n\nHerein the function \u03c8a , for any positive real number a, is given by the following integral\nZ \u221e w2\n\u0010\u03c0 \u0011\n\u2212\n\u2212a cosh(w)\n\u03c8a (h) =\ne 2h e\nsinh(w) * sin w dw ,\nh\n0\n\nfor any h > 0, and we abbreviate\n\n2\n\n2\n\n\u03c0 \u2212\u03bd h\n1\ne 2h 2 .\nc\u03bd,h = \u221a\n\u03c0 2\u03c0 3 h\nWhile Yor's formula seems to require \u03bd to be bigger than at least minus one, it is valid\nfor all real \u03bd. This is proved in [SL, \u00a76].\n\nOne purpose of closed form expressions is to provide means for actually computing\noption prices. While Yor's results above are the key to many insights into the mathematical structure of A(\u03bd) , Yor's formula of the Theorem has a number of structural\ndifficulties in this regard. First, it involves three integrations with seemingly no further\nstructure or further possibilities for simplification. Thus, methods for explicitly computing it will necessarily be rather complex. However, we have noticed an apparently\neven bigger obstacle to computability. For instance taking t0 = 0 and \u031f = r equal to\n5%, we compute the factors c\u03bd,h as follows:\nc\u03bd,h\nT = 1 year\nT = 6 months\n\n\u03c3 = 20%\n2 . 627 \u00d7 10213\n7 . 686 \u00d7 10427\n\nTable 1.\n\nc\u03bd,h\n\n\u03c3 = 30%\n2 . 265 \u00d7 1094\n5 . 717 \u00d7 10189\n\nas function of\n\nT\n\nand \u03c3 .\n\n\u03c3 = 40%\n4 . 816 \u00d7 1052\n2 . 583 \u00d7 10106\n\nAs the examples of \u00a78 or \u00a724 will show, normalized prices of Asian options are not\ntoo big. Yor's formula thus expresses them as the product of a big number times a\ntriple integral. The latter so has to be very small and must be computed with very\nhigh accuracies to get reasonably accurate results. The Laplace transform approach\ndeveloped in [GY] explicitly for the purpose of valuing Asian options was seen to offer\na way out of these difficulties.\n\nII\n\nLaplace transform results\n\n6. The Laplace transform in option valuation: Working with continuous functions on the non-negative real line of at most exponential growth, the Laplace transform\nL (f ) of any such function f is defined by\nZ \u221e\ne\u2212zx f (x) dx ,\nL (f )(z) =\n0\n\nfor any complex number z in a half-plane contained sufficiently deep within the complex\nright half-plane.\nThe connection of this notion with option valuation in general and Asian option valuation in particular is as follows. Fix any option type, like \u00a73's European style Asian call\noption on a certain stock with price S. It will depend on a number of parameters, like\nstrike price and maturity date. At a fixed point in time t, consider the family which\n\n\fBessel Processes and Asian options\n\n7\n\nconsists of all options on the market with all such parameters fixed except maturity\ndates M . In the Asian option example thus consider the Asian options of all maturities\navailable at time t which have the same strike price. In this way regard maturity date\nM as a real variable ranging from t to infinity. The value of the option thus becomes a\nfunction of M .\nHowever, it is normalized prices C (\u03bd) we have to consider for the Asian option. The\nnormalizations of \u00a73 in fact turn C (\u03bd) into a function of, in particular, normalized time\nto maturity. As a function of maturity date M normalized time to maturity is explicitly\ngiven by h(M ) = (\u03c3 2 /4) * (M \u2212t). With M from t to infinity, h(M ) thus ranges from\n0 to infinity. The normalized price of the Asian option so becomes a function on the\nnon-negative real line. Call it fAO for the sake of emphasis. Recalling from \u00a73 how\nthe normalized strike price q depends in an affine linear way on normalized time to\nmaturity, we then have more precisely\nh\n\u0001 i\n(\u03bd)\n\u2217 +\nQ\nAx \u2212(kx+q )\nfAO (x) = E\nfor any non-negative real x.\n\nAt this point we should signal a difficulty with [GY] which we have noticed in Fall 1999.\nIt is not the functions fAO this last paper is working with, but the functions fGY,a given\nfor any positive real a by\nh\n\u0001+ i\n(\u03bd)\nfGY,a(x) = E Q Ax \u2212a\n\nfor any non-negative real x. Notice that the function fAO has a non-constant strike\nprice x 7\u2192 kx+ q \u2217 whereas any function fGY,a has the constant strike price a. So the\nvalue function of the Asian option fAO is different from any function fGY,a which thus\nis the value function of a non-Asian option. Because of the injectivity of the Laplace\ntransform on continuous functions, the Laplace transform L (fAO ) is different from any\nLaplace transform L (fGY,a ) too. The problem at this point so is one of relevance of the\nmathematics for the finance application proper: is there a way of relating the valuation\nof Asian options to the valuation of the non-Asian options?\n\n7. Valuing Asian options using families of non-Asian options: The basic idea\nis as follows. Try to reconstruct the normalized time-t price\nh\n\u0001+ i\n(\u03bd)\nC (\u03bd) (h, q) = E Q Ax \u2212(kx+q \u2217 )\n\nx=h\n\nof the Asian option from a family of auxiliary functions whose single members are\nunrelated to the problem of valuing the Asian option but amenable to the [GY] analysis. Given that the time dependency of the normalized strike price poses the problems,\nsimply force this strike price to be constant. Thus arrive, for any positive real a, at \u00a76's\nfunctions fGY,a on the positive real line recalled to be given by\n\u0002\n\u0003\n+\nfGY,a(x) = E Q (A(\u03bd)\nx \u2212a)\nfor any positive real x. These are the functions considered in [GY]. As we remarked\nin \u00a76 they are the values of certain non-Asian options, and taken individually, they\ncannot be used to value the original Asian option. However, our finding is that as a\n\n\f8\n\nP. Carr and M. Schr\u00f6der\n\nwhole they allow one to recover the normalized time-t price. With the concepts of \u00a73\nthis key reduction is made precise in our following\nLemma: If q = kh+q \u2217 is positive, computing the normalized time-t price C (\u03bd) (h, q) of\nthe Asian option reduces to computing all fGY,a with a > 0. More precisely, C (\u03bd) (h, q)\nis obtained by choosing the function fGY,kh+q\u2217 and evaluating it at h.\nA moment's reflection will convince the reader that this is true by construction, and\nmeanwhile, the particular case of the Lemma we explained to Yor in May 2000 can\nbe found in [Y01, pp. 95\u201396]. Notice that our construction works in the more general\nsituation where functions of the form h(y) = f (y, \u03c6(y)) with a known map \u03c6 have to\nbe computed: compute the functions f and then intersect with the graph of \u03c6 to get h.\nAnd to stress the main result again, as one consequence of this technique, we have at\nthis point reduced valuing Asian options to valuing the family of all non-Asian options.\n\n8. Laplace transforms of the non-Asian option values fGY,a : The key reduction\nof the preceding \u00a77 shows the way to apply the [GY] Laplace transform to value Asian\noptions. Moreover, adopting the notation of \u00a73, consider the family of all functions\nfGY,a with a > 0 that send any x > 0 to\n\u0002\n\u0003\n+\nfGY,a (x) = E Q (A(\u03bd)\nx \u2212a) .\n\nRecall from \u00a77 that its single members are unrelated to valuing the Asian option,\nbut that as a whole, the family allows reconstruction of the normalized time-t price\nC (\u03bd) (h, q) of the Asian option. As a first step in actually computing the fGY,a , try to\ncompute their Laplace transform FGY,a given by\nZ \u221e\ne\u2212zx fGY,a(x) dx = L (fGY,a )(z).\nFGY,a (z) =\n0\n\nHere the complex number z is to be taken in a half-plane sufficiently deep within the\nright complex half-plane such that the integrals are finite. The function so obtained\nis analytic. The precise conditions under which these integrals are finite is part of our\ndescription of these generalized Geman-Yor Laplace transforms in the following\n\nTheorem: If the normalized strike price q is positive, the integrals FGY,a are finite for\nany complex number z with Re (z) > max{0, 2(\u03bd +1)}, and we have\nFGY,a (z) =\n\nD\u03bd (a, z)\nz(z\u22122(\u03bd +1))\n\nwhere on choosing the principal branch of the logarithm\n1 Z\n\u0010x\u0011\ne\u2212 2a \u221e \u2212 x2 \u03bd+3 \u221a\nD\u03bd (a, z) =\ndx .\ne 2a x I 2z+\u03bd 2\na\na\n0\nHerein I\u03bc is the modified Bessel function with complex order \u03bc, as discussed in [L,\nChapter 5]. Generalizing [GY, (3.9), p.363], the integral D\u03bd (a, z) can be expressed\nusing the confluent hypergeometric function \u03a6 discussed in [L, Chapter 9] as follows\n\n\fBessel Processes and Asian options\n\n9\n\nCorollary:\n\nFor any complex z with Re (z) > max{0, 2(\u03bd +1)}, we have\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u03bd+2\u2212\u03bc(z)\n\u03bd +4+\u03bc(z)\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0393\n2\n\u03bd +4+\u03bc(z)\n1\n(2a)\n2\n\u0001 *\u03a6\nD\u03bd (a, z) =\n, \u03bc(z)+1;\n*\n1\n2\n2a\n\u0393 \u03bc(z)+1\ne 2a\n\u221a\non setting \u03bc(z) = 2z+\u03bd 2 .\nWe again stress that these Laplace transforms are not those of the Asian option price,\nbut rather the Laplace transforms of the prices of auxiliary options. To obtain Asian\noption prices, we have to invert these Laplace transforms and then proceed using\n\u00a77 Lemma; formally speaking:\nC (\u03bd) (h, q) = L\n\n\u22121\n\n(FGY,q ) (h) .\n\nIn full mathematical generality, analytic inversion has been achieved in [SA], and we\ncome back to this in \u00a723. Numerical inversions have also been accomplished. For example [FMW] computed the following seven cases as reproduced in [Du00, Table 7.1]\nCase\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n\nr\n2%\n18%\n1.25%\n5%\n5%\n5%\n5%\n\n\u03c3\n10%\n30%\n25%\n50%\n50%\n50%\n50%\n\nT\n1\n1\n2\n1\n1\n1\n2\n\nS0\n2.0\n2.0\n2.0\n1.9\n2.0\n2.1\n2.0\n\n\u03bd\n3\n3\n\u22120.6\n\u22120.6\n\u22120.6\n\u22120.6\n\u22120.6\n\n2C (\u03bd)\n0.056\n0.219\n0.172\n0.194\n0.247\n0.307\n0.352\n\nTable 2. Prices 2C (\u03bd) for K=2.0 and\nusing numerical Laplace inversion.\n\nt0 =t=0\n\nObtaining our two results proceeds in two steps. In a first probabilistic step, the arguments of [GY] are adapted to compute the modified Geman-Yor transforms FGY,a . We\ngive in Part III a new exposition of the argument incorporating the tutorials and kind\nsuggestions of Yor. The key idea is to factorize the geometric Brownian motion of the\nunderlying over a Bessel process of index \u03bd. Pertinent notions are discussed in \u00a79. This\nmakes time stochastic in such a way that Yor's process A(\u03bd) now takes the double role\nof both a stochastic clock and a control variable for the Asian option. At first sight,\nthis appears to complicate the original valuation problem. However, this double role of\nA(\u03bd) is especially suited to the Laplace transform. Indeed, in contrast to the situation\nfor the Asian option, the strike price a of the non-Asian option with value function\nfGY,a is independent of time. This makes it possible to reduce the computation of the\nLaplace transform FGY,a to the following problem: obtain explicit expressions for the\nBessel semigroup of index \u03bd and for a certain conditional expectation involving first\npassage times of Yor's process A(\u03bd) .\nHowever, such results are available for both concepts only if the index \u03bd is non-negative,\nan assumption which is explicit in [GY, \u00a72]. This non-negativity condition, however,\ntranslates into the condition that the risk-neutral drift is not less than half the squared\nvolatility. Unfortunately, this places restrictions on the financial applicability of the\n\n\f10\n\nP. Carr and M. Schr\u00f6der\n\nresult. For example, if volatility is 30%, the arguments of [GY, \u00a73] are not valid if the\ndifference between the riskfree rate and the dividend yield is less than 4.5%, and then\nwe do not have the Laplace transforms of the non-Asian options either. Worse yet, the\ngreater is the volatility, the greater is this range of parameters in which we do not have\nthe Laplace transforms. Unfortunately, it is precisely due to high volatility that Asian\noptions are used in the first place.\nWe have been a bit disconcerted by these findings. Luckily, however, we found that\nin particular those results of Table 2 where \u03bd is negative were reproduced in [Du00]\nusing an alternative approach. And corroborating Andr\u00e9 Weil's [We, p.457] dictum that\n'theorems are proved by those who believe in them', we are now able to discuss in the\nsequel three different ways for stablishing the Theorem and its Corollary for arbitrary\nreal risk neutral drifts \u03bd.\nThe first of these, as discussed in Part IV, is inspired by [Y], and we think Yor could\nhave given this argument had he been aware of the financial motivation for letting the\nparameter \u03bd be negative. In fact, the key idea is to try to bypass the difficulties of\nBessel processes of negative index \u03bd by Girsanov transforming to the simpler Bessel\nprocesses of index zero.This theme is developed also in the third approach discussed in\nPart VI. Here, the idea is not to Girsanov transform Bessel processes derived from the\ngeometric Brownian motion driving the underlying. Instead, Girsanov transform this\ngeometric Brownian motion itself; an idea we distilled from [Y80]. The effect of this\nis that zero drift Bessel processes enter right from the beginnning, and the result is a\nuniform argument based on these most natural Bessel processes.\nIn comparison to these two approaches, our second approach discussed in Part V seems\nsomewhat novel. The idea is to combine stochastic methods with complex analytic ones.\nThe net effect here is that with an input of some standard result from the latter area\nlike the identity theorem, it is not Bessel processes which now have to be dealt with\nbut Brownian motion. For this it is moreover not required to work on the process level,\nas it is sufficient to work on the level of expectations. So this second approach seems\nto be an example of a rather promising methodology for solving problems, which is to\nsystematically enhance stochastic techniques with complex analytic ones.\n\nIII\n\nLaplace transforms if \u03bd \u2265 0\n\n9. Preliminaries on Bessel processes: As a preliminary to establishing the Laplace\ntransforms of \u00a78, this section collects a number of pertinent facts from the theory of\nBessel processes. This theory is patterned after the example of the Bessel processes of\ninteger dimension \u03b4 \u2265 2, which are defined by taking the Euclidean distance from the\norigin of a Brownian motion in dimension \u03b4. Applying It\u00f4's Lemma, their infinitesimal\ngenerator A is seen to be given by\n\nA f (x) = 21 f \u2032\u2032(x) + 2\u03bd2x+1 f \u2032(x) ,\n\n\fBessel Processes and Asian options\n\n11\n\nfor any function f in Cb2 (R>0 ). This notion makes sense for any real number \u03b4, and the\nreal-valued diffusion associated to A using the Volkonskii construction, see for instance\n[K, Theorem 4.3.3, p.91], is the Bessel processes R(\u03bd) on [0, \u221e) with index \u03bd = (\u03b4/2)\u22121.\nWhile Bessel processes of non-negative indices \u03bd stay positive if started with a positive\nvalue at time zero, Bessel processes of negative indices \u03bd develop some pathologies. As\nexplained in [RY, XI \u00a71], in this case they hit zero. If \u22121 < \u03bd < 0, they are thereupon\ninstantantanously reflected and never become negative. For \u03bd = \u22121 they continue at\nzero.\nThis matters for the second way of defining Bessel processes of arbitrary dimension \u03b4.\nIn fact, the focus here is on squares of Bessel processes. Applying It\u00f4's Lemma, they\nare the continuous strong solutions of the stochastic differential equation\np\nd\u03c1t = 2\u03b4dt + 2 |\u03c1t | dBt ,\n\u03c10 = 1\n\n[RY, XI, \u00a71]. These stochastic differential equations make sense for any real number\n\u03b4 and have a unique continuous strong solution also if \u03b4 is smaller than two. The so\nobtained processes are studied in [YG\u00f6, \u00a73]. For non-negative indices \u03bd, they coincide\nwith the squares of the corresponding Bessel processes of index \u03bd. They develop some\npathologies for negative indices \u03bd. In this case, they hit zero if started with a positive\nvalue at time zero, and if \u03bd < \u22121, they even continue negative. Notice that in such\nsituations their square roots are purely imaginary, and so cannot coincide with any\nof the Bessel processes constructed above. However, these two ways of extending the\nnotion of Bessel processes do coincide for processes started at time zero at a positive\nvalue up to the first time zero is hit. This essentially is the reason behind the following\nLamperti identity, which may nevertheless be surprising\nLemma: For the index \u03bd any real number, we have the factorization:\n(\u03bd) \u0001\neBt +\u03bdt = R(\u03bd) At .\n(\u03bd)\n\nfor any t > 0, where At\n\n=\n\nRt\n0\n\ne2(Bw +\u03bdw)dw is Yor's process.\n\nFor \u03bd \u2265 0 a proof is given in [Y92, \u00a72] while the general case is now contained as\nexercise XI (1.28), p.452 in the third edition of [RY]. We are indebted to Yor for this\nand for kindly supplying us with the following argument.\nThe idea is to apply the It\u00f4 rule to the square Zt of Yt = exp(\u03bdt+Bt ) to get\nZ t\nZ t\nZw dBw .\nZw dw + 2\nZt = 2(\u03bd +1)\n0\n\n0\n\nRu\nTime change the process using the inverse function \u03c4 (t) = inf{u| 0 Zw dw > t} to Yor's\nprocess A(\u03bd) to get\nZ \u03c4 (t)\nZw dBw .\nZ\u03c4 (t) = 2(\u03bd +1)t + 2\n0\n\n\f12\n\nP. Carr and M. Schr\u00f6der\n\nTo interpret the stochastic integral in this sum, apply the basic time change formalism\nfor stochastic processes as in [\u00d8, \u00a78.5] to obtain\nZ t\nZ \u03c4 (t)\np\nZw \u03c4 \u2032 (w) dWw\nZw dBw =\n0\n\n0\n\nR \u03c4 (t) \u221a\nZw dBw and is a Brownian\nwhere Wt is defined as the stochastic integral Wt = 0\nmotion. Using the inverse function theorem of calculus, the derivative of \u03c4 is equal\nto the reciprocal of the derivative with respect to time of Yor's process A(\u03bd) at time\nw. Hence it is equal to the reciprocal of Zw . On substitution we so identify the time\nchanged process Z as a continuous solution to the stochastic differential equation for\nthe square of the Bessel process of index \u03bd:\nZ tp\nZw dWw .\nZ\u03c4 (t) = 2(\u03bd +1)t + 2\n0\n\nUsing the uniqueness of the solution of these stochastic differential equations, the timechanged process Z is the square of the Bessel process of index \u03bd. Reversing the time\nchange, this translates into\n(\u03bd)\n(\u03bd)\nYt2 = (Rt )2 (At ).\n\nTo establish the identity of the Lemma, we have to take square roots. This is not\na problem if \u03bd is non-negative since then the Bessel process takes non-negative values\nonly. It does pose a problem if \u03bd is negative. In this case, however, recall that the Bessel\nprocess starts at time zero with a positive value. Since it is continuous by hypothesis,\nit will stay positive until it first hits zero at time t\u2217 > 0. Since the process A(\u03bd) starts\nat zero at time zero, there is a latest point in time t\u2217\u2217 , infinity admitted, such that A(\u03bd)\nis smaller than t\u2217 at all points in time t smaller than t\u2217\u2217 . Thus we have the required\nidentity at least for all points in time t smaller than t\u2217\u2217 . Now Yt is never zero. Since\nthe processes on both sides of the identity are continuous in time, t\u2217\u2217 must be infinity,\nand the proof is complete.\n\n10. Computing Laplace transforms if \u03bd \u2265 0: This section is the first step in the\nproof of the integral representation of \u00a78 Theorem for the Laplace transform\nZ \u221e\ne\u2212zx fGY,a(x) dx = L (fGY,a )(z),\nFGY,a (z) =\n0\n\n+\nwhere, with the concepts of \u00a73 and \u00a76, we have fGY,a (x) = E Q [(A(\u03bd)\nx \u2212a) ], for any positive real numbers a and x. We now explain why one needs to restrict the probabilistic\narguments of [GY] and apply them mutatis mutandis in order to arrive at the following\n\nLemma: The assertions of \u00a78 Theorem are valid if \u03bd = 2\u03c3 \u22122 \u031f\u22121 \u2265 0.\nWe are very indebted to Yor for correspondence and discussions about this result, and\nare very grateful for his kind support. In the sequel, we want to indicate the key steps\nof the proof following [GY], while trying to incorporate his suggestions. Hopefully, no\npitfalls have remained undetected.\n\n\fBessel Processes and Asian options\n\n13\n\nThe basic idea is to make time stochastic using the Lamperti identity\n\u0001\ne\u03bdw+Bw = R(\u03bd) A(\u03bd)\nw\n\nfor all positive real numbers w as has been discussed in the preceding section. Here, R(\u03bd)\nis the Bessel process of index \u03bd with R(\u03bd) (0) = 1. On applying this Lamperti identity,\nA(\u03bd) has the double role of both control variable and stochastic clock. That the \"strike\nprice\" a is independent of time now becomes essential. It makes possible to transcribe\nthe condition on the control variable to be bigger than a as the inverse time change\n(\u03bd)\n\n\u03c4\u03bd,a = inf{u | Au > a}\nfor the stochastic clock. This is the key idea for obtaining the representation\n\u0015\n\u0014 2(\u03bd+1)[w\u2212\u03c4\u03bd,a ]+\n\u22121\n(\u03bd) 2\nQ e\n* (Ra ) ,\nfGY,a(w) = E\n2(\u03bd +1)\nfor all w > 0. Indeed, fix any positive real number x, and consider the process A(\u03bd)\nat x on the set of all events where \u03c4\u03bd,a takes values less than or equal to x. Break the\nintegral defining A(\u03bd) (x) at \u03c4\u03bd,a . The first summand then is A(\u03bd) at time \u03c4\u03bd,a and so\nis equal to a. In the second summand, restart the Brownian motion in the exponent\nof the integrand at \u03c4\u03bd,a shifting the variable of integration accordingly. The second\nintegral then is the product of exp(2 * (B(\u03c4\u03bd,a )+\u03bd\u03c4\u03bd,a )) times A(\u03bd) at x\u2212\u03c4\u03bd,a , by abuse\nof language after having applied the Strong Markov property. This last process is such\nthat it is independent of the information at time \u03c4\u03bd,a . Unravelling the definition of \u03c4\u03bd,a ,\nthe first above factor so is the square of the Bessel process R(\u03bd) at time a.

However, it is just what is especially suited to the Laplace transform FGY,a of fGY,a now given by:\n\u0014 2(\u03bd+1)[w\u2212\u03c4\u03bd,a ]+\n\u0015\nZ \u221e\n\u22121\n\u2212zw Q e\n(\u03bd) 2\ne\nE\nFGY,a (z) =\n* (Ra ) dw .\n2(\u03bd +1)\n0\nStill, for computing this integral one wants to interchange the Laplace integral with\nthe expectation E Q . If z is real, it seems best to follow Yor's proposal for justifying\nthis. Indeed, with the integrand of the double integral in question positive and measurable, apply Tonelli's theorem now but justify only in a later step that any of the\nresulting integrals are finite. The case of a general argument z is reduced to this case\nby considering the absolute value of the integrand, and the result is the identity\ni\nh\n1\nE Q e\u2212z\u03c4\u03bd,a (R(\u03bd) )2\nFGY,a (z) =\nz(z\u22122(\u03bd +1))\n\n\f14\n\nP.

Following [GY, p.362] we make this integral explicit by making the single\nfactors of its integrand explicit. For this, work with the results recalled in [GY, \u00a72].\nWith respect to the conditional expectation factor, under the hypothesis \u03bd \u2265 0, Yor\nhas computed it at positive real arguments z in [Y80, Th\u00e9or\u00e8me 4.7, p.80] (see also\n[GY, Lemma 2.1 and Proposition 2.6]). Using analytic continuation, the validity of his\nresult can be seen to extend to the arguments z in the right half-plane required in the\npresent situation.

This is a consequence of \u00a711 Proposition's convergence analysis of\nthese integrals, and granting this result, the proof of the Lemma is complete.\n\n11.

If |Im (\u03bd)| \u2264 \u03b5, the integrals D\u03bd (a, z) are\nfinite for any complex z with real part Re (z) > 2\u03b52 .\nThe Proposition depends on the following result about the complex square root associated to the principal branch of the complex logarithm.\nLemma: Let \u03b5 \u2265 0 be any real number. For any complex \u03bd with |Im (\u03bd)| \u2264 \u03b5 we then\nhave\np\nRe ( 2z + \u03bd 2 ) > |Re (\u03bd)|\nfor any complex z with Re (z) > 2\u03b52 .\n\nA proof of the Lemma based on a close analysis of the square root can be found in\n[CS, \u00a710]. To prove the Proposition, finiteness of D\u03bd (a, z) under the conditions of the\nProposition follows by combining the above square root lemma with the asymptotic\nbehaviour of the Bessel function factor of its integrand near the origin and towards\ninfinity. Indeed, setting\np\n\u03bc = 2z+\u03bd 2 ,\n\nfrom [L, \u00a75.11] recall that I\u03bc is a continuous function on the positive real line in particular whose asymptotic behaviour for large real arguments is\ne\u03be\nI\u03bc (\u03be) \u2248 \u221a\n2\u03c0\u03be\n\nfor \u03be \u2192 \u221e .\n\nHence the factor exp(\u2212x2 /(2a)) dominates the asymptotic behaviour of the integrand\nof D\u03bd (a, z) with x to infinity, whence its integrability away from the origin. On the\nother hand, from [L, \u00a75.7] we have for real arguments near zero\nI\u03bc (\u03be) \u2248\n\n\u03be\u03bc\n2\u03bc \u0393(1+\u03bc)\n\nfor \u03be \u2193 0 .\n\nThus, if the real part of \u03bc+\u03bd +4 is positive, or equivalently, if we have\nRe (\u03bc) > \u2212(Re (\u03bd)+4),\nno integrability problems arise for x near the origin. Under the conditions of the Proposition, on the other hand, the above Lemma gives\nRe (\u03bc) > |Re (\u03bd)|.\nSince this last inequality implies the former, the proof of the Proposition is complete.\n\n\f16\n\nP. Carr and M. Schr\u00f6der\n\nIV Laplace transforms in the general case:\nusing Girsanov transforms of Bessel processes\n12. Further preliminaries on Bessel processes: Our first way of extending the\nresults of \u00a710 to negative indices \u03bd requires further preliminaries on Bessel processes\nfrom [Y, \u00a72]. Recall that Bessel processes where the index \u03bd is any real number are the\nreal-valued diffusions whose infinitesimal generators A are given by\n\nA f (x) = 21 f \u2032\u2032(x) + 2\u03bd2x+1 f \u2032(x) ,\nfor any function f in Cb2 (R>0 ). To describe the law P\u03bc,u on C(R\u22650 , R\u22650 ) of R(\u03bd) if this\nprocess starts at the non-negative real u, let \u03c1 be the canonical process on C(R\u22650 , R\u22650 );\nrecall it operates as evaluation map: \u03c1a (f ) = f (a). If R is the canonical filtration with\nR a equal to the sigma algebra generated by the \u03c1s with s \u2264 a, we then have the\nmutual absolute continuity relation\nLemma: If the Bessel process of any real index \u03bd is started at any non-negative real\nu, its law is realated to that of the zero index Bessel process started at u as follows\n\u0012 \u0013\u03bc\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\n\u03c1a\n\u03bc2 a ds\nP\u03bc,u\nR a \u2229{a<T0 } = u exp \u2212 2 0 \u03c12s P0,u R a ,\nwhere T0 is the first passage time of \u03c1 to zero.\nThis is proved as an application of Girsanov's theorem by exchanging drifts in the\nstochastic differential equation of \u00a79, and has the following\nCorollary:\n\nFor any complex z with positive real part, and any non-negative real r,\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0015\n\u0012 !\nZ a \u0013\nI\u221a2z ur\nds\n0\nEu exp \u2212 z\n\u03c1a = r =\n,\n2\nI0\na\n0 \u03c1s\n\nwhere the expectation is taken with respect to the law P0,u .\nThe Corollary is proved in two steps. If z is any non-negative real, T0 = \u221e, and we\nhave the explicit expressions for the densities p\u03bc,a (u, r) of the of the Bessel semigroups\nalready encountered in \u00a710 and related to the law via P\u03bc,u (a, dr) = p\u03bc,a (u, r) dr:\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012 \u0013\n\u0010 r \u0011\u03bc r\nur\n1 2 2\nexp \u2212 (u +r ) I\u03bc\n,\np\u03bc,a (u, r) =\nu a\n2a\na\nfor any non-negative reals u, a > 0 and r. And so the Corollary follows on taking\nexpectations in the absolute continuity relation of the Lemma. Observing that both\nsides of the identity to be proved are analytic functions in z on the right half plane,\nthe general case then follows by analytic continuation as a second step.\n\n\fBessel Processes and Asian options\n\n17\n\n13. First proof of the Laplace transform using Bessel processes: Resuming\nthe discussion of \u00a710, we are now able to complete the proof of \u00a78 Theorem in the way\nit might have been envisaged by Yor: based on a careful analysis of Bessel processes.\nRecall that we still need explicitly compute for negative normalized risk-neutral drifts\n\u03bd, the risk-neutral expectations\nh\n\u00012 i\nE Q e\u2212z\u03c4\u03bd,a Ra(\u03bd)\n\nwhere a > 0 and Re (z) is positive and sufficiently big in particular. From the time\nchange part of the argument in \u00a79, recall that \u03c4\u03bd,a as the inverse time change of the\nprocess A(\u03bd) at time a is given by\nZ a\nds\n.\n\u03c4\u03bd,a =\n(\u03bd) \u00012\n0\nRs\nAgain using \u00a79's Lamperti relation\n\n\u0001\neBw +\u03bdw = R(\u03bd) A(\u03bd)\n,\nw\n\nwhich is valid for w \u2265 0, the point now is that a is smaller than the first passage time\nto zero T0 of the Bessel process R(\u03bd) .

An application of \u00a711 Proposition then shows finiteness of this integral if\nz0 = Re (z) is positive and bigger than 2(\u03bd +1), and the first proof of \u00a78 Theorem is\ncomplete. Note that meanwhile the argument of[Y01, pp. 97\u201399] seems to corroborate\nour statement that this proof is very much in the spirit of Yor.\n\n14. Vista on the use of Bessel processes: The strategy of the preceding argument\nis to bypass the difficulties brought about by Bessel processes with negative indices by\nGirsanov transforming to Bessel processes of index zero. One could ask about a direct\nattack in the spirit of \u00a710. This would require possession of explicit expressions for\nboth the densities of the respective Bessel semigroups and the pertinent conditional\nexpectations of exp(\u2212z\u03c4\u03bd,a ). The recent work of G\u00f6ing-Jaeschke and Yor in [YG\u00f6] now\nin particular provides certain analytic expressions for the densities. However, it is not\nBessel processes as considered in \u00a712 which are studied there, but rather processes\nobtained as strong solutions to the stochastic differential equations of squared Bessel\nprocesses, as mentioned in \u00a79. Recall that for negative indices, the latter processes\n\n\f18\n\nP. Carr and M. Schr\u00f6der\n\nbecome negative and their square roots, which should give the Bessel processes, then\nare purely imaginary. Still, the two notions of Bessel processes thus obtained coincide\non their respective positive range. There, we have Bessel semigroup densities based on\nthose derived in [YG\u00f6, \u00a73 Proposition 2, p.21]. For indices \u03bd < \u22121 and time-0 starting\nvalues y > 0, they are given by\n\u0001\ny\u2212x Z 1 (1\u2212w)2(\u03bc\u22121) 1 xw\u2212 y\nw\np\u03bd,t (x, y) = h(x, y, \u03b4, t) e 2t\ndw\ne 2t\nw\u03bc\n0\ndefining\n(xy)\u03bc\u22121\n1\nt\u03b4\u22123\nh(x, y, \u03b4, t) = 2\n\u0393 (\u03bc\u22121) 2(2\u2212\u03b4) (2\u2212\u03b4)\nand with \u03b4 = 2(1 + \u03bd) < 0 and \u03bc = 1 \u2212 \u03bd. However, these densities are in terms of\nnew classes of special functions. The clarification of their relations to those for Bessel\nprocesses of non-negative indices is but one of the problems that require further study.\n\nV Laplace transforms in the general case:\ncombining stochastics and complex analysis\n15. Remarks on general philosphy: The discussion up to now has focused in\nparticular on extension at the process level. The actual valuation problem, however, is\nnot at the process level but at the expectation level. From this point of view, \u00a710 has\nidentified two function f and g in the variable \u03bd and has proved them to be equal for \u03bd\nnon-negative. One would like to have this equality also for negative \u03bd, and thus extend\nthe validity of the identity f = g from the non-negative real line to the whole real line.\nSuch situations quite commonly appear in problems in analysis and are addressed there\nusing analytic continuation. However, functions become amenable to complex analytic\nmethods only on open subsets of the complex plane. Thus the identity theorem of\ncomplex analysis asserts that two functions on a connected open subset of the complex\nplane are equal if they are analytic and agree on a convergent sequence there only. So\nit is in fact no longer possible to stick to real numbers only. As a subset of the complex\nplane they are closed with an empty interior. At this stage, however, nothing is known\nabout the functions of \u00a710 if \u03bd is outside the non-negative real line. In particular,\nit is not known if they exist at all, and this needs to be established togother with\ntheir analyticity properties. Of these two functions, D\u03bd (a, z) is already given as an\nexplicit analytic expression, while the other function is not. In fact, it is not explicit\nat all, as it is defined as the Laplace transform of a certain expectation. The question\nto be tackled here is then how to get explicit analyticity properties from such nonexplicit stochastic concepts. In the present situation, we attack this in two stages.\nFirst, establish analyticity properties of the expectation. Then, in a second step, study\nhow these are preserved on taking Laplace tranforms. As it turns out, using standard\nresults from complex analysis, we find that it is not Bessel precesses which enter into\nthe analysis but simply Brownian motion. All of this may be regarded as an instance\nfor why enhancing stochastics by complex analytic methods seems quite an interesting\nand promising line of thought.\n\n\fBessel Processes and Asian options\n\n19\n\n16. First step \u2013 analyticity of the function D\u03bd (a, z): As a first step in the analytic continuation argument, this section studies the analytic properties of the generalized first Weber integral D\u03bd (a, z) of \u00a78 Theorem.

Using the confluent hypergeometric function \u03a6 discussed in [L,\n\u00a79.9], the precise analyticity result to be proved is the following\nProposition: Let a be any positive real and \u03b5 be any non-negative real.

Combining this with the analyticity properties of \u03a6 discussed\nin [L, \u00a79.9] and those of the gamma function, the Corollary follows from the Proposition.\nThe proof of the Proposition then reduces to exlicitly computing D\u03bd (a, z). For this we\nmodify the quite typical discussion in [W, \u00a713.3, pp.393f] of Hankel's generalization\nof Weber's first integral.

Applying Girsanov's theorem\nsuch that Wx = \u03bdx+Bx becomes a standard Brownian motion, and dropping reference\nto this new measure, we get\nh\n\u0001 \u03bdWx i \u2212 x \u03bd 2\n*e 2 .\nL(x, \u03bd) = E f A(0)\nx e\n\nFor establishing the analyticity statement of the Lemma, it is thus sufficient to show\nthat the expectation factor is analytic in any complex number \u03bd. This is true by definition if we have the convergent series\n\u221e\nh\n\u0001 mi\n\u0001 \u03bdWx i X\n\u03bdm h\n(0)\nE\nf\nA\nE f A(0)\n=\ne\nx Wx\nx\nm!\nm=0\n\nfor all \u03bd. For this it is sufficient to show that the series is absolutely convergent for all\n\u03bd. Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality this is implied by the convergence of\nr h\n\u221e\ni\nir h\nX\n|\u03bd|m\n(0) \u0001\n2\nE f Ax\nE Wx2m\nm!\nm=0\n\n(0)\nE[f 2 (Ax )]\n\nfor all \u03bd. Herein\nis majorized by the second moment of Yor's zero drift\nprocess A(0) at x, and so is finite from [Y, \u00a74].

Actually,\nwe have so established yet another upper bound to the price of the Asian option.\nTo establish the majorization of the Lemma, taking absolute values inside the expectation in the above Girsanov representation of L(x, \u03bd) gives:\ni\nh\n\u0001\nx 2\n|L(x, \u03bd)| \u2264 E f A(0)\n* e\u03bdWx * e\u2212 2 \u03bd .\nx\n\nThe absolute value of the exponential factors are the exponentials of the real parts of\nthe respective arguments.

Third step \u2013 analyticity of the transforms FGY,a : While the preceding section has studied the expectations\n\u0002\n\u0001+ \u0003\nL(x, \u03bd) = E Q A(\u03bd)\nx \u2212a\n\nfor any fixed positive real numbers a and x as function in the complex variable \u03bd only,\nthis section moreover treats x as a variable. If \u03bd is any non-negative real number, we\nhave from \u00a710 Lemma that the integrals of the Laplace transforms\nZ \u221e\ne\u2212zx L(x, \u03bd) dx\nF (\u03bd)(z) =\n0\n\nare finite if Re (z) > 2(\u03bd + 1). In this section we give an independent proof of the\nfollowing more general statement\nProposition: For any complex number z with a positive real part, the map sending \u03bd\nto F (\u03bd)(z) is analytic in all complex numbers \u03bd with Re (z) > 21 Im 2 (\u03bd)+2(Re (\u03bd)+1).\nThe proof of the Proposition is based on the following\nLemma: For any complex number \u03bd, the Laplace transform F (\u03bd)(z) is finite for any\ncomplex number z with Re (z) > max{0, 12 Im 2 (\u03bd)+2(Re (\u03bd)+1)}.\nProof of the Lemma: As first step in proving the Lemma, we establish for any complex\nnumber \u03bd the majorization\nZ \u221e\n\u0001\n2 (\u03bd) x\n\u2212 Re (z)\u2212 1\nIm\n2\ne\n|F (\u03bd)(z)| \u2264\nE Q [Ax(Re (\u03bd)) ] dx\n0\n\nfor any complex number z in the sense of measurable functions. Indeed, majorize the\nabsolute value of F (\u03bd)(z) by taking the absolute value inside the defining integral. The\nabsolute value of the exponential factor then is equal to exp(\u2212Re (z)x). Majorizing the\nabsolute value of L(x, \u03bd) using \u00a717 Lemma, the estimate follows.\n\n\f22\n\nP. Carr and M. Schr\u00f6der\n\nSetting \u03bd0 = Re (\u03bd), now let Re (z) be positive and such that \u03be0 = Re (z)\u2212Im (\u03bd)2 /2 is\nbigger than 2(\u03bd0 +1). We compute the Laplace transform of the right hand side of the\nabove inequality using \u00a74 Lemma. If \u03bd0 is different from minus one,\nZ \u221e\n1\n0)\n,\ne\u2212\u03be0 x E Q [A(\u03bd\nx ] dx =\n\u03be0 (\u03be0 \u2212 2(\u03bd0 +1))\n0\n\nusing that \u03be0 is bigger than 2(\u03bd0 +1) to compute the improper integrals. It converges to\n\u03be0\u22122 with \u03bd0 going to minus one. Thus it is seen to coincide with the Laplace transform\nfor the case \u03bd0 = \u22121. The Laplace transforms are finite if \u03be0 is positive and bigger than\n2(\u03bd0 +1), and then F (\u03bd)(z) is finite a forteriori . The proof of the Lemma is complete.\nProof of the Proposition: For proving the Proposition, fix any complex z with a positive real part and then choose any complex \u03bd0 satisfying the resulting inequality of the\nProposition. In fact, the validity of this inequality then extends to all \u03bd in a compact\nneighbourhood V of \u03bd0 . As a consequence of \u00a717 Lemma, fz (x, \u03bd) = exp(\u2212zx)L(x, \u03bd) is\nfor any x > 0 analytic in \u03bd on V in particular. Since V is compact, the argument of the\nLemma moreover shows that its absolute value is majorized by an integrable function\ng on the real line. The function \u03bd 7\u2192 F (\u03bd)(z) so is continuous on V being obtained by\nintegration of fz over the positive real line. To show it is analytic on the interior of V\nwe want to apply Morera's theorem, see [R, 10.17, p.208] and have to show\nZ\nF (\u03bd)(z) d\u03bd = 0\n\u2202\u2206\n\nfor any triangle \u2206 contained in the interior of V . Indeed, since we have shown fz to be\nintegrable, applying Fubini's theorem gives\nZ \u221eZ\nZ\nfz (x, \u03bd) d\u03bd dx .\nF (\u03bd)(z) d\u03bd =\n\u2202\u2206\n\n0\n\n\u2202\u2206\n\nRecalling that \u03bd 7\u2192 fz (x, \u03bd) is analytic from \u00a717 Lemma, the inner integral herein is\nzero by Cauchy's theorem for \u2206, see [R, 10.13, p.205]. Thus the whole double integral\nis zero, as was to be shown. This completes the proof of the Proposition\n\n19. Final step \u2013 second proof of the Laplace transform using analytic extension: It remains to pull things together and show how the results of this Part V give\na second proof of the two results of \u00a78 by using analytic extension.\nFirst notice that \u00a78 Corollary is implied by \u00a78 Theorem using the computation of\nD\u03bd (a, z) in \u00a716 Lemma. Thus we are reduced to prove \u00a78 Theorem.\nThe proof of \u00a78 Theorem is by analytic continuation using the identity theorem, see\n[R, Corollary to 10.18, p.209]. As a consequence of \u00a710 Lemma it remains to establish\nthe identity in \u00a78 Theorem for negative indices \u03bd only. The existence of the Laplace\ntransform on all complex numbers z with positive real part required in the Theorem\nthen has essentially been proved in \u00a718 Proposition.\nFor establishing the crucial Laplace transform identity of \u00a78 Theorem, thus first let\nz be any complex number with real part Re (z) > 4 and choose 0 < \u03b5 < 1. Using\n\n\fBessel Processes and Asian options\n\n23\n\n\u00a716 Corollary, the generalized first Weber integral\n1 Z\n\u0010x\u0011\ne\u2212 2a \u221e \u2212 x2 \u03bd+3 \u221a\nD\u03bd (a, z) =\ndx\ne 2a x I 2z+\u03bd 2\na\na\n0\n\nis analytic in \u03bd on the \u03b5-thickened real line A\u03b5 which consists of all complex numbers\n\u03bd with |Im (\u03bd)| < \u03b5. Picture A\u03b5 as the band of height 2\u03b5 symmetric with respect to the\nreal axis. If we choose \u03b5 so small that Re (z) > 2(2+2\u03b5), we claim to have analyticity\nof the Laplace transform\nZ \u221e\ne\u2212zx L(x, \u03bd) dx\nF (\u03bd)(z) =\n0\n\nas a function in \u03bd on the \u03b5-thickened half-line B\u03b5 , that subset of A\u03b5 which consists of\n\n0 \u2022\n\n(\u03b5, \u03b5)\n\u2022\n\u2022\n(\u03b5, \u2212\u03b5)\n\nFigure 1. The \u03b5-thickened half-line\n\nB\u03b5 .\n\nall complex numbers \u03bd with |Im (\u03bd)| < \u03b5 and Re (\u03bd) < \u03b5. Indeed, if Re (\u03bd) < \u03b5, we have\n2(2+2\u03b5) > 2\u03b5+2(Re (\u03bd)+2). If |Im (\u03bd)| < \u03b5, we have 2\u03b5 > Im 2 (\u03bd)/2 since \u03b5 < 1. Any\n\u03bd in B\u03b5 so satisfies the inequality Re (z) > Im 2 (\u03bd)/2+2(Re (\u03bd)+2) of \u00a718 Proposition,\nand the claim follows.\nSo the functions F (\u03bd)(z) and\nD\u03bd\u2217 (a, z) =\n\nD\u03bd (a, z)\nz(z \u2212 2(\u03bd +1))\n\nare analytic as functions in \u03bd on the \u03b5-thickened half-line B\u03b5 . It is now a consequence of\n\u00a710 Lemma that we have F (\u03bd)(z) = D\u03bd\u2217 (a, z) for all \u03bd \u2265 0 such that 2(\u03bd +1) < Re (z).\nWith Re (z) > 4 this so holds a forteriori for all \u03bd \u2265 0 such that 2(\u03bd + 1) < 4, i.e.,\nfor all non-negative real numbers \u03bd smaller than 1. With \u03b5 smaller than 1 we so have\nF (\u03bd)(z) = D\u03bd\u2217 (a, z) for any \u03bd in the subinterval (0, \u03b5) of B\u03b5 . With B\u03b5 open and connected\nthe identity theorem literally applies to give that F (\u03bd)(z) = D\u03bd\u2217 (a, z) for all \u03bd in B\u03b5 .\nThis identity then holds a forteriori for all real numbers \u03bd in B\u03b5 , i.e., for all \u03bd < \u03b5.\nThis gives \u00a78 Theorem for any z with Re (z) > 4.\nTo lift this last restriction on Re (z), notice that \u00a718 Lemma implies F (\u03bd) for any fixed\nreal \u03bd to be analytic on the half-plane {Re (z) > 2(\u03bd + 1)}; this is seen by using a\nMorera type argument as for proving \u00a718 Proposition. On the other hand, applying\n\u00a716 Corollary, D\u03bd\u2217 (a, z) as a function of z is analytic on the intersection of this last halfplane with the right-half plane. The validity of the identity F (\u03bd)(z) = D\u03bd\u2217 (a, z) thus can\nbe analytically continued from complex numbers z with Re (z) > 4 to complex numbers\nz with Re (z) positive and bigger than 2(\u03bd +1), and the second proof of \u00a78 Theorem is\ncomplete.\n\n\f24\n\nP.

Remarks on general philosophy: The question may arise if there is not a\nuniform way for computing the Laplace transfoms in \u00a78 Theorem not requiring a two\nstep procedure. The Lamperti factorization\n\u0001\neBw +\u03bdw = R(\u03bd) A(\u03bd) (w)\n\nof \u00a79 Lemma may in fact offer a clue. The idea of the two arguments discussed up to\nnow is to focus on the Bessel process side of this identity. It is the problems with Bessel\nprocesses that transcribe into their two-step approach. A possible remedy so would be\nto try to bring in Bessel processes not at the earliest stage but as late as possible. The\nLamperti factorization suggests to focus on the geometric Brownian motion of its left\nhand side. While Yor has already made extensive use of this device for instance in [Y92,\n\u00a76], we explain in the sequel what seems to be a most natural adaption of the Girsanov\ntechnique to the Lamperti factorization approach for explicitly computing the Laplace\ntransforms FGY,a with a > 0.\n\n21. Third proof of the theorem \u2013 a uniform argument: This section sketches a\nuniform way for computing the Laplace transforms FGY,a with a any positive real, and\nthus provides a third proof of \u00a78 Theorem.

Consequences for Asian options \u2013 Hermite functions: Having persevered\nto this point, the reader may wonder about the nature and the quality of the implications of the mathematics developed up to now. Indeed, going back to the starting\npoint of the journey, it seems that the Laplace transform approach makes possible\nsignificant improvements in understanding \u00a73's normalized prices C (\u03bd) (h, q) of Asian\noptions themselves. These improvements are on a structural level and as such make\npossible advances on computing C (\u03bd) as a consequence. This is essentially by being\nable to establish new links of Asian option valuation with a well-studied class of special\nfunctions: the Hermite functions to be reviewed in this section.\nFollowing [L, \u00a7\u00a710.2ff], to which we refer for details, Hermite functions H\u03bc are analytic\non the complex plane as functions of both their variable z and their degree \u03bc. If the\n\n\f26\n\nP. Carr and M. Schr\u00f6der\n\nreal part Re (\u03bc) of \u03bc is bigger than \u22121, they have the integral representation\nZ\n\u0010\n2\u03bc+1 z 2 \u221e \u2212x2 \u03bc\n1 \u0011\nH\u03bc (z) = \u221a e\ne x cos 2zx\u2212 \u03bc\u03c0 dx .\n2\n\u03c0\n0\n\nSo they specialize to the \u03bc-th Hermite polynomials if \u03bc is any non-negative integer,\nwhence H0 = 1, H1 (z) = 2z, H2 (z) = 4z 2\u22122, H3 (z) = 8z 3\u221212z, for example. If the real\npart of \u03bc is negative, however, Hermite functions change their character. Then they\nhave the integral representation:\nZ \u221e\n1\n2\nH\u03bc (z) =\ne\u2212u \u22122zu u\u2212(\u03bc+1) du ,\n\u0393(\u2212\u03bc) 0\n\u221a\nand so specialize via (2/ \u03c0)H\u22121 (z) = exp(z 2 )Erfc (z) to the complementary error\nfunction Erfc recalled to be given by\nZ \u221e\n2\n\u2212\u03be 2\ne d\u03be .\nErfc (z) = \u221a\n\u03c0 z\nFor any complex \u03bc, Hermite functions can be expressed in terms of the Kummer confluent hypergeometric function \u03a6 by\n\u0011\n\u0010 \u03bc 1\n\u0010 1\u2212\u03bc 3 \u0011\n2\u03bc * \u0393(\u22121/2)\n2\u03bc * \u0393(1/2)\n\u0001 * \u03a6 \u2212 , ; z2 + z *\n\u0001 *\u03a6\n, ; z2\nH\u03bc (z) =\n2 2\n2 2\n\u0393 (1\u2212\u03bc)/2\n\u0393 \u2212 \u03bc/2\n\nfor any complex z. From this representation one can moreover see how Hermite functions\nare connected with the parabolic cylinder functions D\u03bc and with the Kummer confluent\nhypergeometric function of the second kind \u03a8.\n\n23. Consequences for Asian options \u2013 new integral representations: Hermite\nfunctions as recalled in the previous section appear naturally in the closed form solution for \u00a73's normalized price C (\u03bd) (h, q) of the Asian option we have developed in [SA].\nIf the normalized strike price q is positive, it expresses this value as the sum of integral representations which have a product structure. They are obtained by integrating\nproducts of Hermite functions H\u03bc with weighted error functions as follows:\nTheorem: If q is positive, the normalized price C (\u03bd) (h, q) of the Asian option is given\nby the following difference\nC (\u03bd) (h, q) = ce2h(\u03bd+1) S\u03bd+2 \u2212 c S\u03bd\nwhere the S\u03be are three-term sums\nS\u03be = Ctrig \u03be(\u03c1\u03be ) + Chyp,\u03be (\u03c1\u03be ) + Chyp,\u2212\u03be (\u03c1\u03be )\nwhose single summands are integrals that depend on parameters \u03c1\u03be \u2265 0, but which as a\nwhole are independent of these.\nIn terms of \u00a73's concepts, c is given by\nc = c(\u03bd, q) =\n\n1\n\n\u0393(\u03bd +4) * (2q) 2 (\u03bd+2)\n1\n\n2\u03c0 * (\u03bd +1) * e 2q\n\n\fBessel Processes and Asian options\n\n27\n\nrecalling \u03bd = 2\u031f/\u03c3 2\u22121.

Epilogue: On a technical level, the differences just noted between \u00a75's and \u00a723's\n\nformula can be regarded as consequences of the different mathematical approaches for\nproving the valuation formula. In fact, \u00a75's originates from Yor's direct attack on the\nlaw of the integral of geometric Brownian motion. In contrast, \u00a723's is eventually based\non the indirect enveloping construction of \u00a77. In fact, to obtain Asian option prices,\nfirst analytically invert \u00a78 Theorem's Laplace transforms FGY,a , then proceed using the\nkey reduction of \u00a77 Lemma; formally speaking: C (\u03bd) (h, q) = L \u22121 (FGY,q )(h).\n\nHowever, there are not only structural differences between \u00a75's and \u00a723's formula. Finally deriving benchmarks for the normalized prices C (\u03bd) (h, q) of Asian options seems\nto be one of the main practical application of such formulas. As we have already mentioned, Yor's formula seems impracticable for this purpose in particular because of the\ngigantic size of the numbers it involves. For instance, consider valuing Asian options\nwith annual interest rates r equal to nine percent, with maturities of one year, with\nK = S0 , with t0 = 0, and with a volatility of \u03c3 = 30%. These values require coping with\nnumbers of order 10100 . Our formula improves on this aspect as well. In the above situation, for instance, the four hyperbolic terms have orders 107 and the two trigonometric\nterms have orders 10\u22122 . Sharpening results of [RS], it thus became possible to derive in\n\n\f28\n\nP. Carr and M.

Normalized prices C (\u03bd) (h,q) of the Asian option for T =1.\nAll of this may be seen as a consequence of the Laplace transform approach to valuing\nnon-Asian options initiated in [GY]. With hindsight, this paper appears to be a rich\nsource for new results in both mathematics and finance.\nAcknowledgements: The second author is grateful to the support by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft and the hospitality of the Mathematisches Institut of the Universit\u00e4t Mannheim.\nWhile the usual disclaimer applies, we would also like to thank the editor Professor Shiryaev\nfor his interest in the paper and the efforts he has spent on it.\n\nReferences\n[B] R.
