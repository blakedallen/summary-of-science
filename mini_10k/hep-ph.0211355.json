INTRODUCTION\n\nMassive neutrinos can come in two different types: as Dirac or Majorana particles.\nDirac fermions have distinct particles and antiparticle degrees of freedom while Majorana\nfermions make no such distinction and have half as many degrees of freedom [1]. In this\nconditions fermions with conserved charges (color, electric charged, lepton number,...) must\nbe of Dirac type, while fermions without conserved charges may be of either type. New\nneutrinos could have large masses and be of either type. If there are heavy neutrinos (N),\nthen the present and future experiments offer the possibility of establishing their nature.\nThe production of Majorana neutrinos via e+ e\u2212 , e\u2212 \u03b3, \u03b3\u03b3 and hadronic collision have been\nextensively investigated in the past [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]. In this work we study the possibility of\nthe \u03b3\u03b3 linear collider to produce clear signatures for Majorana neutrinos. The photon linear\ncollider [10] may be the best alternative to the electron positron colliders. In this paper\nwe discuss the possible detection of Majorana neutrinos in the reactions \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 W \u00b1 W \u00b1 lj\u2213 lk\u2213\n(lj \u2261 e, \u03bc, \u03c4 ) where the real gamma beam are obtained by Comptom backscattering of laser\nphotons off the linear electron beam. In this process most of the photons are produced at the\nhigh energy regions. For the cross section calculation we have used the helicity formalism\n[11,12], considering the complete set of Feynman diagrams show in Fig.1. The phase space\nintegration was done taking account that the intermediate neutrinos can be either on shell\nor off shell. In this\n\u221a point the present work differ of previous calculation [9] where the\nrestriction MN > s is\u221aconsidered and then only neutrinos off-shell are take into account.\nOf course, for MN < s the new heavy neutrino is more likely to be first discovered via\nsingle production in e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bdN. However the \u03b3\u03b3 collider have some facilities that make\nit suitable to search Majorana neutrinos and study their interactions. In particular a \u03b3\u03b3\ncollider offer the possibility to control the helicity of the colliding photons controlling the\nhelicity of the Laser photons. Using these polarized high energy photon beams we have\nthe possibility to study in detail the interactions of Majorana neutrinos and reject possible\nbackgrounds. Due the large CM energies of these colliders we have considered that the mass\nof the final lepton vanishes.\nFor the couplings of the Majorana neutrinos we follow Ref [6] starting with rather general\nlagrangian densities for the interaction of N with W and light leptons lj (e, \u03bc, \u03c4 ):\nLN W l\n\n3\nX\n\n(j)\n\ngBL  \u0304 \u03bc\n\u221a lj \u03b3 PL NW\u03bc\u2212 + h.c.\n=\u2212\n2\nj=1\n\n(1)\n\nThe heavy Majorana neutrino couples to the three flavors lepton with couplings proportional\n(j)\n(j)\nto BL , where j labels the family. This (BL )2 constant are, in notation of [13], the sin square\n\u03bd\nof the mixing angle between light and heavy neutrinos ((SL\u03bde )2 , (SL\u03bc )2 , (SL\u03bd\u03c4 )2 ). The constant\ng is the standard SU(2)L gauge coupling.\n(j)\n\nThis BL parameters will affect the final results via the combinations\n(i)\n\nHi =| BL |2\n\nand\n\nH=\n\n3\nX\n\nj=1\n\n1\n\n(j)\n\n| BL |2\n\n(2)\n\n\fThe final leptons can be either of e\u2212 , \u03bc\u2212 or \u03c4 \u2212 because this is allowed by the interaction\nlagrangian (eq.1). All these possible final states are a clear signal for intermediary Majorana\nneutrino and then we sum the cross section over the flavors of the final lepton. This sum\ndepend of H, H1 , H2 and H3 in the numerator of the total cross section. In the other\nhand this cross-section also depends on H through the total width \u0393N \u2192all in the Majorana\nneutrino propagator. This last dependence is relevant when the Majorana neutrino is onshell. We use the Breit-Wigner propagator for the Majorana neutrino N for different values\nof the mass MN . The total width \u0393N \u2192all of N was determined at tree level considering the\ndominant decay modes N \u2192 W \u00b1 lj\u2213 :\n\u0393N \u2192all =\n\ng2H\n2\n2\n4\n(M 2 \u2212 MW\n)(MN4 + MN2 MW\n\u2212 2MW\n)\n2\n(32\u03c0MN3 MW\n) N\n\n(3)\n\nThe constants Hi (i = 1, 2, 3) are severely restricted by available experimental data\n(CERN e+ e\u2212 collider (LEP) and low energies data) [13,14]. This bounds are\nH1 < 0.0066\nH2 < 0.006\nH3 < 0.018\n\n(4)\n\nIn this conditions the upper bound for H is H < 0.031. However the bound on H1 is even\nmore restricted once the constraint from \u03b2\u03b20\u03bd are taken into account [15]. It is H1 < 2\u00d710\u22125\nfor MN < 1 TeV and then the electronic channel do not contribute appreciablement in\nthe kinematic region examined in the present work. The above mentioned bound do not\nconstraint the muonic and tauonic channel and do not put new limits on the constants H2\nand H3 . Then, when the bounds from \u03b2\u03b20\u03bd are considered the new upper bound on H is\nH < 0.024.\n\n(5)\n\nIt is the value we have considered in the present article. In this work we have considered the complete set of Feynman diagrams (Fig.1) that contribute at tree level to\n\u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 W \u00b1 W \u00b1 lj\u2213 lk\u2213 (\u2192 jets + lj lk ) with the light leptons l1 = e, l2 = \u03bc, l3 = \u03c4 .\nIn | M\u0304 |2 we average over the initial photon polarizations and sum over the final polarization of the both W and lj\u2212 and over the flavor of the final leptons. Moreover an 21\nfactor is included to avoid double counting of the two W and another 12 to avoid double\ncounting of the two identical\nleptons when integrating over the phase space. We take as\n\u221a\ninputs the values of s and MN . The H dependence is complicate due to the Majorana\nneutrino propagator . We have founded that the most important contribution \u221a\nto | M\u0304 |2\ncoming from the couplings is proportional to H 2 . However in the MW < MN < s \u2212 MW\nkinematic region (Reg.I), where the intermediate Majorana neutrino may be on-shell, the\ntotal cross-section\nis approximately proportional to the H value. In the other hand in the\n\u221a\nMN > s \u2212 MW region (Reg.II), where the Majorana neutrino is off-shell, the total crosssection is approximately proportional to H 2 . The behaviour in Reg.I is easy to realize if we\n2\n\n\fmake the so-called peaking approximation, in which the Breit-Wigner shape of the Majorana\nneutrino propagator is replaced by a delta function. In this region the H 2 dependence in\nthe numerator is canceled by the H factor in the total width. Considering only the relevant\nfactors in the cross section, we have\n\u03c3=\n\nX\nj\n\n\u03c3j \u223c * * * H 2\n\n1\n(q 2 \u2212\n\nMN2 )2\n\n+ MN2 \u03932N\n\n***\n\n(6)\n\nwhere j labels the final lepton flavors. Making now the peaking approximation\n***\n\n1\n(q 2\n\n\u2212\n\nMN2 )2\n\n+\n\nMN2 \u03932N\n\n*** \u2192\n\n\u03c0\n\u03b4(q 2 \u2212 MN2 )\nMN \u0393N\n\n(7)\n\nP\n\nand since that \u0393 \u223c H (eq.3) then we can see that \u03c3 = j \u03c3j is approximately proportional\nto the H value in Reg.I. The expression for M is too long. It extend over tens of page\nwhen printed out and we do not present explicitly it here. We show\n\u221a the numerical results\nfor the cross-section for the \u03b3\u03b3-subprocess for different values of sb (the center of mass\nenergie of the \u03b3\u03b3 subprocess) and MN . The numerical Monte Carlo integration was done\nusing the FORTRAN subroutine RAMBO\n\u221a [16]. The Fig.2 show the MN dependence of\nthe unpolarized cross-section \u03c3b at fixed sb for the maximum value of H given by eq.5.\nTo check the correctness of our final 4-body calculation we include in the\u221asame figure the\ncorresponding results for the final 3-body process (\u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 l\u2213 NW \u00b1 ), for sb = 500 GeV.\nMoreover,\u221apartial results were also checked using the CalcHep program [17]. In Fig.3 we\nshow the sb dependence of \u03c3b for different values of MN keeping the same values for H.\n\nIn the following the embedding of the subprocess \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 W \u00b1 W \u00b1 lj\u2213 lk\u2213 into appropriate\nphoton fluxes is presented. We have considered real gamma beam obtained by the Comptom\nbackscattering of laser photon off the linear electron beam. The mentioned subprocess is\nrelated to e+ e\u2212 collition by folding the \u03b3\u03b3-subprocess cross-section (\u03c3b (sb)) with appropriate\n\u03b3\u03b3 luminosity function:\n\u03c3(s) =\n\nZ\n\n\u03c4 max\n\n\u03c4 min\n\nd\u03c4\n\ndL\u03b3\u03b3\n\u03c3b\u03b3\u03b3\u2192W \u00b1 W \u00b1 l\u2213 l\u2213 (\u03c4 s)\nd\u03c4\n\n(8)\n\nThe differential luminosity dL\u03b3\u03b3 /d\u03c4 is defined as usual in terms of photons structure\nfunctions of electrons (f (x)) beam:\ndL\u03b3\u03b3\n=\nd\u03c4\n\nZ\n\nxmax\n\u03c4\nxmax\n\n\u03c4\ndx\nf (x)f ( )\nx\nx\n\n(9)\n\n\u221a\nwhere \u03c4 = sb/s. sb is the center of mass energy of the subsystem and \u03c4 min is determined\nby the production threshold:\n\u03c4 min = (2mW )2 /s\n3\n\n(10)\n\n\fand x is the fraction of the parent electron's energies carried by the photons. The\nmaximum possible value for x is\nxmax =\n\n\u03be\n,\n1+\u03be\n\nwhere\n\n\u03be=\n\n4E0 \u03c90\n;\nme\n\n(11)\n\nwhere E0 and \u03c90 are the incident electron and laser light energies. To avoid unwanted\ne+ e\u2212 pair production from the collitions between the incident and back-scattered photons,\nwe should \u221a\nno choose too large \u03c90 . This fact constraint the maximum value for \u03be to be\n\u03be = 2(1 + 2). The variable \u03c4 is obviously \u03c4 = xa xb , the product of electron's energies\nfractions. In this conditions the minimal value for x is \u03c4 /xmax and the maximum value for\n\u03c4 is (xmax )2 . This justify the integral limits in eq(8) and (9).\nIn the other hand we can translate eq(8) and (9) in a alternative expression for the\ncross-section:\n\u03c3(s) =\n\nZ\n\nxmax\n\nxmin\na\n\ndxa\n\nZ\n\nxmax\n\u03c4 min\nxa\n\ndxb f (xa )f (xb )\u03c3b (xa xb s)\n\n(12)\n\nwhere xmin\n= \u03c4 min /xmax .\na\nTo illustrate the possible impact of this process in the\u221adiscovery of Majorana neutrinos\nwe show in Fig 4 the number of events as a function of s for MN = 300GeV . We have\nconsidered the maximum possible value of H as inferred of the experimental bounds (eq.(5)).\nWe have used the estimated luminosity [18] for the \u03b3\u03b3 collider of L = 100f b\u22121 . We have\nignored the experimental difficulties of detecting the discussed process unambiguously but if\nwe take as reasonable the threshold of 100 events then we could see signatures for Majorana\nneutrinos with mass of 300 GeV for center of mass energies greater than 700 GeV. We have\nalso include in Fig.5 a contour plot for different number of events as a function of H and\n\u221a\ns for MN = 300 GeV. The horizontal line represent the maximum possible value for H.\nSummarizing, we calculate the cross-section for the process \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 W \u00b1 W \u00b1 lj\u2213 lk\u2213 where\nl1 , l2 and l3 are light leptons (e, \u03bc, \u03c4 ) respectively. \u221a\nWe show the total unpolarized crosssection for the subprocess \u03b3\u03b3 for different values of s and MN . We have included all the\ncontributions considering that the intermediate Majorana neutrinos\u221acan be either on-shell\nor off-shell. Finally we show the number of events as a function of s considering the real\ngamma beam is obtained by the Comptom backscattering of laser photons off the linear\nelectron beam.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank CONICET (Argentina) and Universidad Nacional de Mar del Plata (Argentina) for their financial supports.\n\n4\n\n\fREFERENCES\n[1] B.
