The most recent world average is \u2206md = 0.502 \u00b1 0.007 ps\u22121 (1.4%\naccuracy). An estimate of the errors for 500 fb\u22121 data is also given.\n\n2 Dilepton measurement\n\nIn the Standard Model, B0 -B0 oscillations occur through\nsecond-order weak interactions, mainly through internal\nloops containing virtual t quarks. The mixing parameter\n\u2206md , the mass difference between the two mass eigenstates, is thus related to the Vtb and Vtd CKM matrix elements. The measurement of \u2206md can therefore in principle\nprovide a means to extract |Vtd |. In addition, \u2206md plays a\nrole in the parameterization of the CP asymmetries in the\nB0 system: a precise measurement of \u2206md is also needed\nfor CP violation measurements (see [1,2]).\n\nIn this analysis [4,5], semi-leptonic decays B \u2192 X \u2212 l+ \u03bdl\nfrom both B mesons are used to tag the B flavor with\nthe sign of the lepton. Two fast leptons are searched for.\nThe decay vertex position of the B meson is determined\nfrom the interception of the lepton track with the profile\nof the interaction point. Because of the large semi-leptonic\nbranching fraction, this analysis offers the largest statistics.\nHowever, the purity of the signal is affected by the background coming from charged B mesons.\n\nPOF (\u2206t)\nPSF (\u2206t)\n\n=\n=\n\nEvents / 0.24 ps\n\nIn this article, we present different measurements of \u2206md\nfrom the time distributions of opposite-flavor (OF \u2013 B0 B0 )\nand same-flavor (SF \u2013 B0 B0 , B0 B0 ) neutral B decays at the\n\u03a5(4S ) resonance. The theoretical time-dependent probabilities for observing OF and SF states are given by:\n\nEvents / 0.24 ps\n\n1 Introduction\n\ne\u2212|\u2206t|/\u03c4B0\n[1 + cos(\u2206md \u2206t)]\n4\u03c4B0\ne\u2212|\u2206t|/\u03c4B0\n[1 \u2212 cos(\u2206md \u2206t)]\n4\u03c4B0\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c4B0 is the B0 lifetime and \u2206t is the proper time difference between the two B meson decays. This assumes CP\nand CPT conservation in the mixing, as well as negligible\n\u2206\u0393 (decay width difference between the two B meson mass\neigenstates).\nThe analyses presented here were performed on data collected with the BaBar and the Belle detectors [3]. A 9 GeV\n(resp. 8 GeV) electron beam and a 3.1 GeV (resp. 3.5 GeV)\npositron beam are collided in the PEPII (resp. KEKB)\nstorage ring, resulting in a Lorentz boost of the centerof-mass of \u03b2\u03b3 = 0.55 (resp. 0.425) with respect to the\nlaboratory frame. Since B mesons are nearly at rest in the\n\u03a5(4S ) frame, the proper time difference \u2206t is approximated\nby \u2206z/\u03b2\u03b3c, \u2206z being the (signed) distance between the decay vertices of the two B mesons along the beam axis. The\nflavor of the B mesons is determined using flavor-specific\ndecays.\n\n(a)\n4000\n2000\n0\n600\n\n(b)\n\n400\n200\n0\n\nAsymmetry / 0.24 ps\n\narXiv:hep-ex/0306061v2 1 Jul 2003\n\nIPHE, University of Lausanne\n\n0.8\n\n(c)\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\n-10\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n\u2206 t (ps)\n\nFigure 1.

Mixing asymmetry fitted by Belle on the dilepton \u2206z\ndistributions.\n\n3\n\nD\u2217 \u03c0 partial reconstruction\n\nBelle uses another partial reconstruction method [6] to extract \u2206md from B0 \u2192 D\u2217\u2212 \u03c0+f decays. The D\u2217\u2212 information\nis extrapolated from the soft pion of D\u2217\u2212 \u2192 D0 \u03c0\u2212s , and\nthen combined with the fast pion \u03c0+f and the beam information to reconstruct the B meson. The flavor is given by\nthe charge of the fast pion. The other side is tagged by\nsimply looking for a fast lepton. 31 fb\u22121 on-resonance data\nwas used in this measurement.\nContributions of various backgrounds can be estimated\nfrom the D0 \"missing mass\" (see Fig. 3). A simultaneous unbinned maximum likelihood fit to OF and SF events\nyields: \u2206md = 0.509 \u00b1 0.017 \u00b1 0.020 ps\u22121 .\n\n4\n\nD\u2217 l \u03bd full reconstruction\n\nThis method [7,8] fully reconstructs B0 \u2192 D\u2217\u2212 l+ \u03bd, with\nD\u2217\u2212 \u2192 D0 \u03c0\u2212 and D0 \u2192 K + \u03c0\u2212 , K + \u03c0\u2212 \u03c00 , or K + \u03c0\u2212 \u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212\n(BaBar also reconstructs K s \u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212 ). The flavor of the\nother B meson is tagged using the same algorithms as in\nRef. [1,2] (a neural network for BaBar, a multidimensional\nlikelihood for Belle).\nThe cosine of the angle between the reconstructed D\u2217 l system and the B meson momenta in the \u03a5(4S ) frame is used\nto separate the signal from various backgrounds (D\u2217\u2217 , fake\nD\u2217 , random D\u2217 l and continuum). An unbinned maximum\nlikelihood fit is then performed on the \u2206z distributions.\nThe results of the fit by BaBar, shown on Fig. 4, yields\n\n1.860\n\nFigure 3.

Neutral B mesons are reconstructed in\nthe decay modes D(\u2217)+ \u03c0\u2212 and D(\u2217)+ \u03c1\u2212 (and also D(\u2217)+ a\u22121\nby BaBar), with D\u2217+ decaying into D0 \u03c0+ and D0 decaying\ninto K \u2212 \u03c0+ , K \u2212 \u03c0+ \u03c00 or K \u2212 \u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212 \u03c0+ (or also K s \u03c0+ in BaBar's\ncase). The \u03c1\u2212 and a\u22121 are formed of \u03c00 \u03c0\u2212 and \u03c0\u2212 \u03c0+ \u03c0\u2212 , respectively. Finally, BaBar also includes B0 decaying into\nJ/\u03c8K \u22170 .

Mixing asymmetry and result of the fit to hadronic\nmodes (Belle).\n\nBaBar performs an unbinned likelihood fit including resolution parameters on 30 fb\u22121 on-resonance data and finds\n\u2206md = 0.516 \u00b1 0.016 \u00b1 0.010. Belle uses the resolution function used for lifetime measurements [11] and obtains \u2206md = 0.528 \u00b1 0.017 \u00b1 0.011 ps\u22121 from 29 fb\u22121 onresonance data (see Fig. 6).\n\nWithin 3 years, BaBar and Belle will have collected\n500 fb\u22121 each (about 15 times more than what was used\nhere). An extrapolation of the systematic errors for each\nindividual measurement has been made in order to estimate\nthe accuracy on \u2206md that could be reached. Improvement\nof the current limiting systematic errors are evaluated from:\na better precision on the B lifetime, a larger amount of\nMonte-Carlo statistics, an accurate measurement of some\nbranching fractions (e.g. B \u2192 D\u2217\u2217 l \u03bd). In addition, resolution parameters are expected to be better extracted from\ndata. The average value is then computed in the same way\nas for the world average, with the central value fixed to\nthe present average. A total error of 0.0023 ps\u22121 is found,\nwhich corresponds to 0.5% of 0.502 ps\u22121 .\nThese extrapolations do not take into account possible improvements of the existing analyses. On the other hand, the\nevolution of systematic errors is hard to predict. This 0.5%\naccuracy should therefore be treated carefully.\n\n7 Conclusion\nA number of measurements of \u2206md have been performed\nby the BaBar and Belle collaborations. These efforts have\nlead to a world average of \u2206md = 0.502 \u00b1 0.007 ps\u22121 . The\n\n\f4\n\nWorkshop on the CKM Unitarity Triangle, IPPP Durham, April 2003\n\nerror takes into account statistical and systematical correlations between the measurements. The current accuracy on\n\u2206md is currently 1.4%, and is expected to reduce to about\nhalf a percent within a few years.\nIn the future, \u2206m s will be measured with high precision.\nThe error on \u2206md may then become a limiting factor on\nthe determination of related CKM matrix parameters (see\ndiscussion in [13], chapters 4 and 5). In the meanwhile,\nas the accuracy on \u2206md is approaching the percent level,\nefforts are moving to more fundamental tests of underlying assumptions. Limits on CPT violating parameters have\nbeen set [5], and measurements of \u2206\u0393 have started [14].\n\nReferences\n1. B. Aubert et al. (BaBar collab.), Phys. Rev. Lett. 89\n201802 (2002).\n2.
