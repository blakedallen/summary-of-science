A cooperative structural relaxation process was observed. From the in-plane scattering vector dependence of the relaxation rates in hydrogenated and deuterated samples, combined\nwith results from a 0.1 \u03bcs long all atom molecular dynamics simulation, it is concluded that correlated dynamics in lipid membranes occurs over several lipid distances, spanning a time interval\nfrom pico- to nanoseconds.\nPACS numbers: 87.16.dj, 87.14.Cc, 83.85.Hf, 87.15.ap, 83.10.Mj\n\nIt is speculated that atomic and molecular motions in\nregions of biomolecular systems with strong local interactions are highly correlated on certain range of time\nand length scales [1, 2]. In proteins intra-protein correlations are believed to be essential for their biological\nfunctioning, such as protein folding, domain motion and\nconformational changes. Very recently, inter-protein correlations in protein crystals and also membranes have\nbeen reported from experiment and simulation [3, 4]. Experimental and computational effort has been invested\nto study collective molecular motions in phospholipid\nmodel membranes [5, 6, 7, 8] to understand the possible impact on physiological and biological functions of\nthe bilayers, such as transport processes [9], and eventually their implication on function of membrane-embedded\nproteins. While fast (picosecond) propagating collective\nmicroscopic fluctuations in the plane of the bilayer can be\nunderstood as sound waves [10, 11], the slow (nanosecond) in-plane mesoscopic fluctuations (undulations) are\ngoverned by the elasticity properties of the bilayers [12].\nWe studied dynamical modes at nearest neighbor distances of the lipid molecules using the neutron backscattering technique [13]. These modes are too fast to be\naccessed by x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy and\nthe lateral length scales involved are too small to be resolved by dynamic light scattering or the neutron spinecho technique. Selective deuteration was used to discriminate relaxations due to collective molecular motions\nfrom relaxations arising from localized, single molecule\nexcitations. In this Letter, we examine results of inelastic neutron scattering experiments that demonstrate the\nexistence of slow coherent motion of lipid molecules in\nthe fluid phase of phospholipid bilayers. From the inplane scattering vector dependence (q|| ) of the measured\nrelaxation rates, combined with results of a 0.1 \u03bcs long all\natom molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, we find that\nthe cooperative structural dynamics in lipid membranes\noccurs over several lipid distances, spanning a time inter-\n\nval from pico- to nanoseconds.\n\nThe experiments were carried out at the cold neutron backscattering spectrometer IN16 [14] at the Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL) with an energy resolution of\nabout 0.9 \u03bceV FWHM (\u03bb=6.27 \u00c5). An energy transfer of \u221215 \u03bceV< E < +15 \u03bceV and a q range of\n0.43 \u00c5\u22121 < q <1.92 \u00c5\u22121 were scanned, accessing\ntime scales of 0.28 ns<t<4.6 ns and length scales of\n3.2 \u00c5<d<14.6 \u00c5. A separate line of diffraction detectors\nallowed to determine the bilayer structure in-situ. Protonated (DMPC-h) and partially (acyl chain) deuterated\n1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phoshatidylcholine (DMPCd54), along with protonated cholesterol were obtained\nfrom Avanti Polar Lipids. Highly oriented multi lamellar\nmembrane stacks of several thousands of lipid bilayers of\nDMPC and DMPC/cholesterol were prepared by spreading a solution of typically 25 mg/ml lipid and lipid/40%\ncholesterol (wt/wt) in trifluoroethylene/chloroform (1:1)\non 2\" silicon wafers, followed by subsequent drying in\nvacuum and hydration from D2 O or H2 O vapor. Twenty\nsuch wafers (five for DMPC-h) separated by small air\ngaps were combined and aligned with respect to each\nother to create a \"sandwich sample\" consisting of several\nthousands of highly oriented lipid bilayers (total mosaicity about 0.5\u25e6 ). The deuterated (protonated) samples\nhad a total mass of about 400 mg (100 mg) of lipid or\nlipid/cholesterol. The samples were mounted in a hermetically sealed aluminum container within a cryostat\nand hydrated from D2 O or H2 O vapor. By aligning the\nbilayer normal at 135, respective 45 degrees with respect\nto the incoming neutron beam, the momentum transfer\ncould be placed in the plane of the bilayers (q|| ) or perpendicular to the membranes (qz ). The lamellar spacing of the DMPC sample was determined to dz =54 \u00c5\nat T=30\u25e6 C, which corresponds to a relative humidity of\nRH=99.6% [15]. Five different samples (referred to as\nS1,..., S5) were prepared:\n\n\fBilayer\nDMPC\nDMPC\nDMPC\nDMPC\nDMPC\n\n-d54\n-d54\n-h\n-h\n-d54\n\nCholesterol Content Hydration\n\u2013\nD2 O\n\u2013\nH2 O\n\u2013\nD2 O\n\u2013\nH2 O\n40% cholesterol\nD2 O\n\nNeutrons are scattered by the atomic nuclei, and each\nelement intrinsically has non zero coherent and incoherent scattering cross sections. In experiments the different contributions can be enhanced with respect to each\nother, by, e.g., using different isotopes or selective deuteration. While in protonated samples the incoherent scattering is dominant and the time-autocorrelation function\nof individual scatterers is accessed, (partial) deuteration\nemphasizes the coherent scattering and probes the pair\ncorrelation function. By careful analysis of the scattering of all samples S1 to S5, it was possible to emphasize\nbetween the collective and self motions in the underlying\ndynamics. Sample S5 allowed us to investigate the effect\nof cholesterol incorporation on the collective dynamics\nof the lipid backbone because protonated cholesterol was\nused.\nFigure 1(a) depicts in-plane diffraction patterns, i.e.,\nstructure factors S(q|| ), at 303 K. Subtracting S(q|| ) for\nsamples S3 and S1 emphasizes the coherent scattering of\nthe lipid acyl chains. Similarly, subtraction of S(q|| ) for\nS3 and S5 emphasizes the coherent lipid tail scattering\nin the cholesterol sample. Finally, to emphasize coherent\nwater scattering, the diffraction pattern of S4 was subtracted from that of S3. There are two peaks in S(q|| )\nof the lipid chains around q|| = 0.7 \u00c5\u22121 and 1.4 \u00c5\u22121 ,\nwhich correspond to the nearest neighbor distances of\nphospholipid head groups and the acyl chains in DMPC,\nrespectively. The peaks shift to smaller q|| values in the\npresence of cholesterol, indicating a slight increase in the\nnearest neighbor distances. The water scattering is enhanced towards the water correlation peak around 2 \u00c5\u22121 ,\nbut there is no pronounced diffraction peak within the instrumental resolution.\nFigure 2 exemplarily depicts spectra measured at q|| =\n0.5 \u00c5\u22121 and 1.5 \u00c5\u22121 for S1 and S4 at a temperature\nof T=303 K, in the fluid phase of the bilayers. A fast\nand a slow relaxation process were visible in the data\nand data were therefore fitted using two Lorentzians and\nconvoluted with the instrumental resolution. Because\nthe faster process (the broad Lorentzian) could not be\ndetermined with sufficient accuracy, this Letter focuses\non the slower relaxation process (\u03c91 ). \u03c91 might contain contributions from incoherent and coherent scattering. A quantitative determination of the coherent and\nincoherent relaxation rates would require purely coherent and purely incoherent scatterers or neutron polarization analysis (which has not yet been realized on a\nneutron backscattering spectrometer) to discriminate the\ndifferent contributions to \u03c91 .

This points to a strong coupling of\ndynamical properties to the static structure of the system\nand to a softening of the coherent relaxation rate around\nthe maximum of the static structure factor S(q|| ). The\nslowing down of the decay of the density autocorrelation\nfunction for distances corresponding to nearest neighbors\nis known as de Gennes narrowing [16]. The momentum\ndependence of the dynamical parameters in the collective\ndynamics case is not trivial as in the single-particle case\nbut points to coherent structural relaxation. Because\nthe out-of-plane component (q\u22a5 ) of the scattering vector (also in Fig. 1(b)) shows no minimum, it is concluded\nthat the relaxation process is confined to the plane of the\nmembranes.\nTo gain further insight in the above relaxation process,\nwe performed an all atom MD simulation of DMPC and\nanalyzed the motion of the carbons within the lipid tails.\nThe fully solvated system, built from a pre-equilibrated\nDMPC bilayer [17], contained 128 lipid and 2577 TIP3\nwater molecules. The MD simulation was performed\nwith NAMD-2.6 [18] using the CHARMM27 [19] force\nfield. The pair interactions were turned off smoothly from\n10 \u00c5 to 12 \u00c5, and the long-range electrostatic interactions were calculated using the PME method [20]. The\nsimulation was performed in the NVT ensemble using\nperiodic boundary conditions. A constant temperature\nof T=303 K was maintained by employing a Langevin\nthermostat with a coupling constant of 0.05 ps\u22121 . After\nproper energy minimization and thermal equilibration, a\nproduction run of 0.1 \u03bcs was carried out on 40 CPUs\n\nFIG. 3: The slow relaxation times \u03c4c (closed circles) and \u03c4s\n(open squares) as a function of wave-vector q|| .

The sums are taken over the N carbon atoms\nin the lipid tails and ~rn (t) is the position of the nth atom\nat time t. The scattering vector ~q|| is parallel to the x \u2212 y\nplane of the lipid bilayer. By examining Is/c (qk , t) we\ncan isolate purely coherent and incoherent contributions\nto the scattering due to the carbons within the lipid tails.\nThe minimum in \u2206\u03c91 (q|| ) shown in Fig. 1 suggests a\nlonger relaxation time for Ic (qk , t) than for Is (qk , t) for\nqk values around the peak of S(qk ) = Ic (qk , 0). Shown\nin inset to Fig. 3 are Is/c (qk , t) for qk = 2.5 \u00c5\u22121 and\n1.42 \u00c5\u22121 . For qk = 2.5 \u00c5\u22121 the decay times for Is (qk , t)\nand Ic (qk , t) are almost identical, but Ic (qk , t) decays\nslower for q|| around the first peak of the static structure factor. We defined the decay time \u03c4 (qk ) as when\nIs/c (qk , \u03c4 (qk ))/Is/c (q, 0) = e\u22121 . Shown in Fig. 3 are\n\u03c4s (qk ) and \u03c4c (qk ) along with S(qk ). Note that the nonmonotonic behavior of \u03c4c (q|| ) yields a minimum in the\ndifference \u03c4s \u2212 \u03c4c around the peak of S(qk ). Thus, the\nMD simulation results are in qualitative agreement with\nthose from the experiment and reinforces the conclusion\nthat the difference of the quasielastic widths \u2206\u03c91 (q|| ) is\ndue to correlated dynamics of the lipid acyl chains.\nTo determine the temporal and spatial extent of the\ncorrelated motion of the lipid tails, we calculated the\ncorrelation function\ng\u2206 (r, t) =\n\nV\n\u00d7\nh\u2206ri2 N\n\n\f4\n3\n\n(b)\n\n0.2\n\nt = 2.5 ps\n0.1\n\n1\n\nG(r,t)\n\n\u0393(t) (\u00c5)\n\n(a)\n2\n\nt = 1.09 ns\n0 -4 -3 -2 -1 0\n1\n10 10 10 10 10 10\n\nt (ns)\n\n5\n\n0\n10 15 20 25 30\n\nr (\u00c5)\n\nRFIG. 4:\n\nMeasures of the correlated dynamics \u0393(t) =\nG(r, t)dr. \u0393(t) is a measure of the size of the correlated\ndisplacement at a time t, and G(r, t) measures the spatial\nrange of the correlations.\n\nX0\n\ncal structural perturbance of the lipids could propagate\nin the bilayer, which might be relevant for the understanding of processes and functions involving collective\nstructural changes.\nWe acknowledge financial support from the DFG\nthrough project SA 772/8-2.

Thus\nR\n\u0393(t) = [g\u2206 (r, t)/g1 (r) \u2212 1] dr provides a measure of the\ncorrelation of in plane displacements of the carbon atoms\nwithin the lipid tails between different lipids [21].\nExamination of \u0393(t), Fig. 4(a), shows that the displacements of the lipid acyl tails are correlated for times from\naround 1 ps to 1 ns, i.e., for much longer than the microscopic collision time but shorter than the time needed for\na lipid to diffuse one lipid diameter. This is exactly the\ntime window of the structural relaxation probed by the\nneutron scattering experiments and corresponds to the\ndecay times \u03c4s/c . Thus, we associate \u2206\u03c91 observed in\nthe experiments and the difference in decay times \u03c4c \u2212 \u03c4s\nto correlated motion of lipid tails.\nFinally, the spatial decay of G(r, t) = g\u2206 (r, t)/g1 (r)\u22121\nyields the length scale associated with the correlated displacements. Shown in Fig. 4b is G(r, t) for t1 = 2.5 ps (at\nthe peak of \u0393(t)) and t2 = 1.1 ns. For both times G(r, t)\ndoes not decay to zero until around 30 \u00c5. Therefore, the\nlipid tails displacements are correlated for at least four\nto six lipid diameters between t1 and t2 .\nIn conclusion we found experimental evidence for a cooperative structural relaxation process in fluid phospholipid membranes. An all atom molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that the displacements of the lipid\ntails are correlated for up to six lipid diameters for a time\nspan from picoseconds to around a nanosecond. Experimental data of the sample containing cholesterol proved\nthat the process is present not only in pure lipid bilayers, but also in more complex and relevant membranes.\nA possible implication of this motional coherence of the\nlipid acyl chains is, e.g., that information about a lo-\n\nElectronic address: RheinstadterM@missouri.edu\n[1] C.
