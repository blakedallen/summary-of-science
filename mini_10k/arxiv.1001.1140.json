There are various approaches to create quantum computer. First solid state quantum\ncomputer was built using artificial atoms \u2013 transmons (cooper pair boxes) in superconducting\nresonator. It was recently proposed to use an ensemble of atoms with long coherence time as a\nmulti-qubit quantum memory for such kind of quantum computer where the cooper pair boxes\nare used for realization of single and two-qubit gates. However the operation of such computer is\nlimited because of using a number of processing rigid cooper boxes working with fixed\nfrequency at temperatures of superconducting material. Here, we propose a novel architecture of\nquantum computer based on a flexible wire circuit of many coupled quantum nodes containing\ncontrolled atomic (molecular) ensembles. We demonstrate wide opportunities of the proposed\ncomputer. Firstly, we reveal a perfect storage of external photon qubits to multi-mode quantum\nmemory node and demonstrate a reversible exchange of the qubits between the quantum memory\nand any arbitrary nodes. We found optimal parameters of atoms in the circuit and self quantum\nmodes for quantum processing. The predicted perfect storage has been observed experimentally\nfor microwave radiation on the lithium phthalocyaninate molecule ensemble. Then also, for the\nfirst time we show a realization of the efficient basic two-qubit gate with direct coupling of two\narbitrary nodes by using appropriate atomic frequency shifts in the circuit nodes. Proposed twoqubit gate runs with a speed drastically accelerated proportionally to the number of atoms in the\nnode. The direct coupling and accelerated two-qubit gate can be realized for large number of the\ncircuit nodes. Finally, we describe two and three-dimensional scalable architectures that pave the\nroad to construction of universal multi-qubit quantum computer operating at room temperatures.\nConstruction of large quantum computer (QC) is a synergetic physical and engineering problem\nwhich imposes a number of critical requirements on physical and spatial organization of\ninterconnections between the qubits of QC and with its near environment necessary for a\nquantum transmission and readout of quantum calculations results1,2. Quantum computing is\nbased on delicate exploitation of number of various single- and two- qubit gates. Usually, single\nqubit gates are relatively easily fulfilled experimentally by using a well-known coherent control\nof single two-level atoms (atomic qubit) or molecular qubits in external resonant electromagnetic\nfields5-7. Also, the single photon qubit gates can be realized by the linear optics technique which\nprovides simple procedures for rotation of the light phase and polarization with a control of light\nby mirrors and beamsplitters8-9.\nIt is necessary to have a high enough coupling constant between qubits in order to realize\nsufficiently fast two-qubit gates. Few promising approaches have been proposed to increase a\n\n\fcoupling constant of two qubit interactions. For example, using a single mode optical cavity\nprovides the enhanced coupling constant of the interaction between an atomic qubit and a photon\nin the cavity10,11. This idea got an extensive use in modern proposals of quantum information\nprocessing. Very powerful method to increase the coupling constant with a photon is to use a\nJosephson qubits cooper characterized by superconducting current of mesoscopic magnitude12\nand by using the Josephson qubits (transmons) in superconducting resonators13,14. The two qubit\ntransmon processor has been demonstrated recently3 for successful implementation of the Grover\nsearch and Deutsch\u2013Jozsa quantum algorithms.\nAnother promising tool of the coupling constant enhancement is an encoding of qubits on\nmulti-atomic coherent states. Here, the coupling constant of N atoms with a photon can be\nenhanced by factor\n\nN . Initially the multi-atomic coherent ensembles have been used for\n\noptical quantum memory (QM)15-21, implementation of robust quantum communication over\nlong lossy channels22 and for single photon generation23. Recently collective ensembles of\nmultilevel systems have been discussed for QM cooperated with quantum computing24,25 and this\nidea has been developed to use the multi-qubit QM integrated in a hybrid superconducting QC\nfor encoding of the qubits cooperated with transmon cooper pair box used for quantum\nprocessing4. In this paper, the single and two qubit gates can be performed by coherent control of\ntransmon qubit in the external electromagnetic field and via the two-qubit iSWAP gate with the\ncavity photon state. Complete quantum computing for large number of qubits is realized by a\ntransfer of any pair of the qubits on the transmon and photon qubits with their subsequent\nswapping and using single qubit gates. The hybrid approach had been proposed for quantum\nprocessing of more than 100 qubits stored in common atomic ensemble embedded in\nsuperconducting transmission line resonator.\nWire circuit\nWe propose a novel architecture of multi-qubit QC based on flexible wire circuit which couples\nmany atomic ensembles situated in different spatial nodes. We demonstrate how the wire circuit\narchitecture yields possibility to use available technologies for effective multi-qubit QM, faster\nquantum processing satisfying the di-Vincenzo criteria26. In particular, scalability is easily\nachievable for the proposed circuit based architecture. The simplest wire circuit scheme is shown\nin Fig.1. The circuit consists of three basic elements: an usual cupper receiver (R-) loop with\ndiameter D1, two-wire transmission (TWT-) line and second loop with highly reduced spatial\ndiameter D2 containing the resonant atoms (node). Two wires of the TWT-line are twisted in\norder to suppress an irradiation in external space. In our experiments, we used diameter D2 =0.4\nmm which is more than 500 times smaller than the used wavelength \u03bb = 250 mm of the\n\n\fradiation transmitted through the external waveguide. The R-loop provides an efficient reception\nof the radiation from the closely situated waveguide output loop as shown in Fig.1. At small\nlength of TWT-line, the wire circuit works as a single mode resonator. We have been urged\nexperimentally in a robust work of the wire resonator in its numerous spatial architectures. Rloop with inductivity L and capacity C tuned by varying length of line l (see Fig.1) determines a\nresonant frequency \u03c9o = 1 / LC of the circuit. TWT-line was adjusted to R-loop by choosing its\nspatial length as l = n\u03c0c /(\u03c9o \u03b5 o\u03b5 ) = n\u03bbTW / 2 , where \u03bbTW is a wavelength of radiation in the\nTWT-line, c is the speed of light, \u03b5 is a nondimensional permittivity of TWT-line volume, n is\nan integer. We note that a distance between two twisted wires in TWT-line was few orders\nsmaller than the wavelength so the coupling between TWT-line and R-loop didn't change the\nresonant frequency \u03c9o while the line provided an effective transmission of the electromagnetic\nfield between the loops. Since the RS-loop had a negligibly small spatial size the electromagnetic\nfield evolved as a standing wave along the TWT-line with the same electrical current in the wires\nof nodes and R-loop. Thus the wire circuit works as a spatially distributed single mode resonator\non the resonant frequency \u03c9o with Q-factor Q = r \u22121 L / C , where r is a total losses resistance in\nthe circuit (the losses were negligibly weak in our experiments) and the circuit provides an\neffective quantum electrodynamics of the atomic ensemble with electromagnetic field of the\nsingle resonator mode.\nMulti-mode quantum memory\nBy following cavity mode formalism27 we describe an efficient multi-qubit QM in our circuit.\nWe use the Tavis-Cumming Hamiltonian28,29 H\u02c6 = H\u02c6 o + H\u02c6 1 for N atoms, field modes and their\ninteractions generalized by taking into account inhomogeneous broadening of atomic frequencies\nand\n\ncontinuous\n\nspectral\n\ndistribution\n\nof\n\nthe\n\nfield\n\nmodes\n\nwhere\n\n2\nH\u02c6 o = h\u03c9o {\u2211 j =1 S zj + a\u02c6 + a\u02c6 + \u2211n=1 \u222b b\u02c6n+ (\u03c9 )b\u02c6n (\u03c9 )d\u03c9} are main energies of atoms ( Szj is a z-\n\nprojection of the spin operator), energy of cavity field ( \u00e2 + and \u00e2 are arising and decreasing\noperators), energy of waveguide field (n=1) and energy of free space field (n=2) ( b +n and b n are\narising and decreasing operators of the waveguide modes);\n2\nH\u02c6 1 = h \u2211 j =1 \u0394 j S zj + h \u2211n=1 \u222b (\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9o )b\u02c6n+ (\u03c9 )b\u02c6n (\u03c9 )d\u03c9\n2\n+ ihg \u2211 j =1[ S \u2212j a\u02c6 + \u2212 S +j a\u02c6 ] + ih \u2211n=1 \u222b \u03ba n (\u03c9 )[b\u02c6n (\u03c9 )a\u02c6 + \u2212 b\u02c6n+ (\u03c9 )a\u02c6 ]d\u03c9 .\n\n(1)\n\nThe first two terms in (1) comprise a perturbation energies of atoms (where \u0394 j is a frequency\ndetuning of j-th atom) and the field modes; the third and fourth terms are the interaction energy\n\n\fof atoms with cavity mode ( S+j and S\u2212j are the transition spin operators, g is a coupling\nconstant) and interaction energy of the cavity mode with the waveguide and free propagating\nmodes characterized by coupling constants \u03ba n (\u03c9 ) .\nWe note that\n\n[\u0124 o , \u01241 ] = 0 and Hamiltonian \u0124 o characterizes a total number of\n\nexcitations in the atomic system and in the fields which is preserved during the quantum\nevolution where \u0124 o gives a contribution only to the evolution of common phase of the wave\nfunction. H1 determines a unitary operator U\u02c6 1 (t ) = exp{\u2212iH\u02c6 1t / h} causing a coherent evolution\nof the atomic and field systems with dynamical exchange and entanglement of the excitations\nbetween them. In spite of huge complexity of the compound light-atoms system here we show\nthat their quantum dynamics governed by H1 in (1) can be perfectly reversed in time on our\ndemand in a simple robust way.\nWe assume that initially all atoms ( j = 1,2,..., N ) stay on the ground state\n\n0 = 01 ,0 2 ,...,0 N and free mode fields are in the vacuum state and we launch a signal multimode weak field to the circuit through the waveguide at t=0 as shown in Fig.1. Total temporal\nduration of the signal field should be shorter than decoherence time of the atomic system\n( \u03b4t << T2 ). By assuming that the spectral width \u03b4\u03c9 of the signal field is narrow in comparison\nwith spectral window of waveguide transmission and inhomogenenous broadening of the\nresonant line ( \u03b4\u03c9 << \u0394 in ) the consideration of the atoms and field evolution for \u03b4t < t << T2\ngives an efficiency Qeff of the signal field storage (a ratio of stored in atomic system energy to\nincoming energy of the signal field):\n\nQ eff =\n\n\u03b31\n\n4\u0393 /(\u03b3 1 + \u03b3 2 )]\n,\n(\u03b3 1 + \u03b3 2 ) | 1 + \u0393 /(\u03b3 1 + \u03b3 2 )] |2\n\n(2)\n\nplotted in Fig. 3, where \u03b3 i = \u03c0\u03ba i2 (\u03c9o ) determines coupling between the cavity mode with\nwaveguide modes and with the free propagating modes, \u0393 = N qm g 2 / \u0394 in - coupling of cavity\nmode with atomic system, Nqm is a number of atoms in the QM node.\nAs it is seen in Fig.2, the quantum efficiency Qeff reaches unity at \u0393 / \u03b3 1 = 1 and\n\n\u03b3 2 / \u03b3 1 << 1 that shows a possibility of perfect storage for multi-mode signal field at moderate\natomic density. Note that \u03b3 1 = \u0393 is a condition of optimal matching between the waveguide\nmodes and the atomic system in QM node. In this case all multi-mode signal fields incoming in\nthe circuit transfer to the atomic system of the QM node. The efficient direct unconditional\ntransfer of the multi-mode field is possible for inhomogenously broadened atomic (electron spin)\n\n\ftransition where the effective quantum storage of multi-mode fields occurs for arbitrary temporal\nprofile of the modes.\nWe examined experimentally the signal storage for the radiation field with carrier\nfrequency \u03bd = 1.2 GHz. We varied parameter \u03b3 1 by changing a spatial distance between R-loop\nand waveguide output loop in Fig.3 a) and found that all signal field energy was transferred to\nthe electron spin systems of lithium phthalocyaninate (LiPc) molecule sample at the optimal\nmatching value of \u03b3 1 = 3.768 \u22c5107 where the reflected field was absent in the waveguide. At this\ncondition we have observed a strong signal of the electron paramagnetic resonance depicted in\nFig.4 b) from \u2248 4.51 \u22c5 1013 LiPc molecules situated in one distant node.\nIn order to construct an efficient QM for the multi-mode fields we follow the original\nprotocol of the photon echo QM proposed in 200119 and theoretically described29 in most general\nway in the Schr\u00f6dinger picture by exploiting symmetry properties of the light atoms Hamiltonian.\nHere, we exploit simplicity of this approach in description of the multi-mode QM in the\nproposed QC. The assumed atomic detunings \u0394 j are caused by a presence of the magnetic field\ngradient. By assuming a perfect storage in accordance with above coupling matching condition\nwe change a sign of the detunings \u0394 j \u2192 \u2212\u0394 j at time moment t=t' by changing of the magnetic\nfield polarity similar to recent experiments30. By using a substitution for the field operators\n\na\u02c6 = \u2212 A\u02c6 and b\u02c6n (\u03c9 o \u2212 \u0394\u03c9 ) = B\u02c6 n (\u03c9 o + \u0394\u03c9 ) (with similar relations for the Hermit conjugated\noperators) we get a new Hamiltonian \u01241 ' = \u2212\u01241 which has an opposite sign with respect to initial\nHamiltonian determining a reversed quantum evolution in accordance with a new unitary\noperator U\u02c6 2 [(t \u2212 t ' )] = exp{\u2212iH\u02c6 1 ' (t \u2212 t ' ) / h} = exp{iH\u02c6 1 (t \u2212 t ' ) / h} . So the initial quantum state of\nthe multi-mode signal field will be reproduced at t = 2t ' in the echo pulse with the irradiated\nfield spectrum inverted relatively to the frequency \u03c9o in comparison with the original one. Thus\nwe have shown for the first time that the multi-mode QM can be realized with 100% efficiency\nby using the optimal matching condition \u03b3 1 = \u0393 of the atoms in circuit with the waveguide\nmodes.\nQuantum processing\nLet's consider a principle scheme of the QC operation for three node circuit depicted in Fig. 4.\nThe circuit contains the QM node and two processing nodes. QM node is loaded in gradient\nmagnetic field providing an inhomogeneous broadening of atomic frequencies \u0394 in >> \u03b4\u03c9 f with\ncentral atomic frequency coinciding with the circuit frequency \u03c9qm = \u03c9o . The second and third\nnodes have N atoms in each node with equal frequencies \u03c92,3 within each node tuned far away\n\n\ffrom the frequency \u03c9o . We should provide a perfect transfer of arbitrary qubits between QM\nnode and each other two nodes. Initially, the multi-qubit states encoded in the M temporally\nseparated photon modes E ( t ) = \u2211 m =1 E m ( t ) with spectral width \u03b4\u03c9f are recorded in the QMM\n\nnode by excitation from the external waveguide. When the storage procedure is completed we\ntune away the atomic frequency of the QM node from resonance with the circuit \u03c9qm \u2260 \u03c9o . In\norder to transfer one arbitrary k-th qubit state from the QM node to the second node we switch\noff the wire circuit coupling with the external waveguide ( \u03b3 1 = 0 ) and launch rephasing of the\natomic coherence in QM node (by reversion of the atomic detunings \u0394 \u2192 \u2212\u0394 ). The m-th qubit\nstate will be rephased at t=2tm. At time moment tk +tk-1 we equalize the frequencies of QM-node\nand 2-nd node with \u03c9o . The quantum dynamics of atoms in QM and 2-nd nodes and circuit\nmode evolves to complete transfer of atomic excitation from the QM node to the second-node at\nt=2tk\n\nwhen\n\nthe\n\ntemporal\n\nshape\n\nof\n\nrephased\n\nsingle\n\nphoton\n\nwave\n\npacket\n\nis\n\nEk (t ) = Eo exp{\u2212\u0393 | t \u2212 2tk | / 2} sin S (t \u2212 2t k ) / S ( S = Ng 2 \u2212 (\u0393 / 2) 2 , t < 2tk , Eo is an\namplitude). These modes are the self-modes of the QC that provide the perfect reversible\ncoupling of multi-mode QM with processing nodes. Similar temporal shape was proposed\nrecently for single-mode QM31. After qubit transfer, we switch off the coupling of the 2-nd node\nwith resonator by changing the frequency of atoms in the 2-nd node. The same procedure can be\nfulfilled for transfer of qubit from QM node to the 3rd node.\nFor realization of two-qubit gates we equalize the carrier frequencies of the 2-nd and 3-rd\nnodes with some detuning from the resonator mode frequency \u03c91k \u2212 \u03c9o = \u03941k = \u03c92 \u2212 \u03c9o = \u0394 2 = \u0394 .\nThis results in interaction of the atoms in the two nodes and between the nodes via the virtual\nprocesses\n\nof\n\nresonant\n\ncircuit\n\nquanta\n\ndetermined\n\nby\n\nN\n2\n3\nm)\n(m)\n= h( g / \u0394)\u2211i j Si+1m S\u2212jm\n+ H\u02c6 int , where \u0124 (node\nH\u02c6 eff = \u2211 m =1 H\u02c6 node\n\neffective\n\nHamiltonian32,33\n\nis a long-range spin-spin\n\nm m\n\n(\n\n)\n\ninteraction in m-th node, \u0124 int = h( g / \u0394)\u2211 j , j =1 S+j1S\u2212j2 + S\u2212j1 S+j2 describes a spin-spin interaction\n2\n\nN\n\n1 2\n\nbetween the nodes. The spin-spin interaction with atoms of QM-node is suppressed because of\nthe absence of resonance.\nLet's introduce four collective basis states in the two nodes: 0 1 0 2 , 1 1 0 2 , 0 1 1 2 and\n\n1 1 1 2 , where\n1\n\nm\n\n0\n\nm\n\n=| 01 ,0 2 ,...,0 N m \u3009 corresponds to ground state of the m-th node,\n\n= ( N m ) \u22121 / 2 {| 11 ,0 2 ,...,0 N m \u3009+ | 01 ,12 ,...,0 N m \u3009 + ...+ | 01 ,0 2 ,...,1N m \u3009}\n\nis\n\na\n\nsingle\n\natomic\n\nsuperposition excited in the 2-nd and 3-rd nodes (m=2,3) after transfer of a single photon state\nfrom QM node via the QC self-mode. It is important that the Hamiltonian \u0124 eff has a matrix\n\n\frepresentation in the basis separable from other states of the multi-atomic system\n( N 2 = N3 = N )\n\u239b0 0\n\u239c\nh | g | \u239c0 N\n\u0394 \u239c0 N\n\u239c\n\u239c0 0\n\u239d\n2\n\n0 0 \u239e\n\u239f\nN 0 \u239f\n.\nN 0 \u239f\n\u239f\n0 2 N \u239f\u23a0\n\n(3)\n\nThe structure of matrix (3) coincides with the matrix structure of two interacting two-level atoms.\nSo the unitary evolution in the Hilbert space of four collective states will be the same but\ndrastically accelerated N-times comparing to the case of two coupled two-level atoms. In\nparticular the coherent oscillations between the states 1 1 0\n\n2\n\nand 0 1 1 2 will occur with\n\ncoherent frequency \u03c9 \u0441 = 2 N | g | 2 / \u0394 . By taking into account our experimental situation we can\nget \u0394 = 10\u0394 n that leads to \u03c9 \u0441 = \u03b3 1 / 10 = 3.768 \u22c5 10 6 . It is known32, 33 that the evolution of the two\ncoupled two level atoms can lead to iSWAP and\n\niSWAP . In our case the gates are realized at\n\nshortened times: 1 / \u03c9 \u0441 \u2245 2.65 \u22c5 10 \u22127 sec. and 1 /(2\u03c9 \u0441 ) = 1.325 \u22c5 10 \u22127 sec. Thus using the described\n\niSWAP realization we can achieve a fast transfer of a chosen qubit from the QM node to the\nsecond node. In the same way one can transfer arbitrary other qubit to the third node from the\nQM node. Then we can perform\n\niSWAP gate which entangles the two qubits and provides a\n\ncomplete set of universal quantum gates together with single qubit operations. Single gates can\nbe performed with arbitrary qubits by switching on the coupling \u03b3 \u2192 \u03b3 1 with a chosen node and\ntransfer the atomic qubit to photonic qubit in waveguide where it can be rotated on arbitrary\nangle by usual means9. On demand we can return the qubit back to QM node by using welldeveloped fast methods of linear optics. Another possibility to organize single qubit gates is to\ntransfer quantum information to the node with single resonant atom which state can be controlled\nby external classical field11.\nDiscussion\nThe described principle 2D scheme of the quantum processing can be extended to large number\nof nodes as depicted in Fig.5. Moreover the 2D scheme is scalable to 3D architecture presented\nin Fig.6 due to its flexibility. We note an important possibility to make a parallel quantum\nprocessing with two different qubit pairs simultaneously by equalizing the carrier frequencies in\neach pair at different values between the pairs. In our experiments we have already realized a\ncircuit with 5 spatially delocalized nodes organized along one straight TWT-line. We have\n\n\fobserved strong EPR signals from each node that have demonstrated a real possibility to\nincorporate more than 100 coupled nodes in one QC of wire circuit architecture.\nIn this work we proposed a novel architecture of solid state QC based on wire circuit\ncoupling multi-atomic systems in distinct quantum nodes. Experimentally we demonstrated basic\nphysical properties of the architecture for perfect transfer of the light field to the circuit nodes\nand a possibility of a robust work with many distinct nodes. Theoretically we reveal perfect\nmulti-mode QM for optimal experimentally attainable condition and we propose self-modes of\nQC and demonstrate a reversible transfer of an arbitrary gubit from the QM node to arbitrary\nother node. Also, we show a realization of fast iSWAP gate for arbitrary pair of two nodes which\ndrastically accelerates basic quantum processes and opens a way for parallel operation of\nquantum gates. We demonstrated that the proposed QC architecture is a highly flexible for 2D\nand 3D wire-circuit configurations and that it is practically scalable for construction of many\ncoupled distinct quantum circuits that opens a promising way for practical realization of multiqubit QC with a number of coupled qubits limited only by the atomic coherence time. We\nanticipate that the proposed atomic QC can principally work at room temperatures for example\non NV-centers in a pure diamond which looks now one of promising candidates of the qubit\ncarriers up to ~10-3-1 sec. timescale34.\nMethod Summary\nExperimental measurements have been performed on the original EPR spectrometer of L-band\nspectral range with resistive magnet of the Varian Company. Wire circuits were fabricated from\na lacquered cupper wire with diameter 0.2 mm. Resonant frequency of circuit R-loop was tuned\nby using Rohde & Schwarz SMT03 (5kHz-3GHz) Sweep Generator. Radiation transfer from the\nwaveguide to the circuit node has been controlled by detection of the minimum radiation\nreflection to the bridge of the spectrometer.\nAcknowledgment\nThe authors thank the grant of the Russian Foundation for Basic Researches number 08-0700449, Scientific School grant # 4531.2008.2 and Government contract of RosNauka #\n02.740.11.01.03.\nReferences\n1.
