Box 208120, New Haven, CT 06520-8120\n(Dated: July 10, 2018)\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0002 \u0003\nWe report detailed spectroscopic measurements of the X(0) 1 \u03a3+ (v = 0) \u2192 B(1) 3 \u03a0 (v = 5)\ntransition in PbO. Using a Stark-modulated laser absorption technique, we have measured the\nhyperfine constant of 207 PbO in the B(1) state, as well as the B(1)(v = 5) rotational constant,\nX \u2212 B isotope shifts, etc. The hyperfine constant of the B(1) state is of interest as a benchmark\nfor calculations of PbO electronic structure, related to experiments to search for the electric dipole\nmoment of the electron.\nPACS numbers: 33.15.-e,33.20.Kf,14.60.Cd\n\nSpectroscopy of the PbO molecule has become of interest since it is a good candidate for use in searches for\na permanent electric dipole moment (EDM) of the electron, de . EDMs are interesting because a non-zero value\nfor an EDM of any fundamental particle would violate\nparity and time-reversal symmetries. Standard model\npredictions for EDMs are well below any proposed experimental sensitivities. However, most extensions of the\nstandard model predict dramatically enhanced EDMs.\nA promising approach towards improving the limits on\nde involves heavy polar diatomic molecules in a configuration with an unpaired electron spin. In such systems,\nthe effective electric field Wd seen by the unpaired electron can be many orders of magnitude larger than external fields attainable in the laboratory [1, 2]. An electron\nEDM can be detected by spin polarizing an electron along\nthis internal field and searching for the characteristic linear Stark shift \u2206E = \u2212de Wd . Interpreting experimental\nlimits on \u2206E measured in a molecule in terms of de requires a value for Wd . This can be obtained using semiempirical wavefunctions for the state of interest [1], or\nfrom ab initio calculations [2]. Spectroscopic properties\nsensitive to the electron spin density at the nucleus such\nas hyperfine structure (hfs) can constrain the parameters\nin semi-empirical evaluations of Wd , or test the predictions of ab initio calculations.\nAn\u0002 experiment\nis underway in our lab using the\n\u0003\na(1) 3 \u03a3+ state of PbO, that may improve the current\nlimit |de | < 1.6 \u00d7 10\u221227 e cm [3] by several orders of\nmagnitude [4]. Such an improvement would probe large\nregions of the parameter space of many standard model\nextensions. Stimulated by this work, a measurement of\nthe hyperfine constant of the a(1) \u0002state\n\u0003 was recently reported [5]. The hfs of the B(1) 3 \u03a0 state of 207 PbO\nis also of interest, since it can be used to further check\nand/or refine the electronic structure calculations used to\ncalculate the value of Wd in the a(1) state. In addition,\nknowledge of the B(1) hfs can be used for estimating Wd\n\n\u2217 Present\n\nAddress : Department of Physics, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003 and RIKEN-BNL Research Center,\nUpton, NY 11973\n\nfor the B(1) state, which also may be a viable candidate for an EDM search [6]. This motivates this effort to\ndetermine the hfs of the B(1) state of PbO.\nThe measurements were made by observing the absorption of laser light by PbO vapor in a cell as the laser\nwavelength was tuned. The cell contains PbO of natural\nisotopic abundance; it is constructed from a 5.7 cm cube\nof alumina, with 5.1 cm diameter through holes bored\nperpendicular to, and centered on, each face. The top\nand bottom holes of the resulting cubical frame structure are capped with alumina plates. Thin YAG windows are bonded on the remaining four holes using gold\nfoil as an intermediate layer. The cell is heated to 700\u25e6 C\nby the radiation from resistively heated thin foils of tantalum supported on a quartz framework surrounding the\ncell. This results in a PbO number density n \u2248 4 \u00d7 1013\ncm\u22123 in the cell. The laser used in the measurements\nwas an external cavity diode system based on a standard\ndesign [7]. Our system used a Nichia NLHV500C violet\ndiode laser and 3600 grooves/mm diffraction grating in\na Littrow configuration. The laser provided <\n\u223c1 mW of\npower around 406.5 nm which passed through the YAG\nwindows into the cell.\nTo enable sensitive lock-in detection of the absorption,\nwe employed a Stark modulation technique [8]. As explained below, this method enhances signals from low J\nlevels where the hfs is largest, which are otherwise difficult to isolate within the spectrally congested region near\nthe bandhead. Here we briefly discuss the basic features\nof the Stark-modulated signals, as relevant to our experiment.\nThe Stark effect in the X(0) \u2192 B(1) transition is dominated by shifts due to mixing between the closely-spaced\n\u03a9-doublet levels in the B(1) state. The doublet members, e and f , share a common value of total (electronic\n+ rotational) angular momentum J but are of opposite\nparity. The spacing between the doublet levels is given\nby \u2206\u03a9 (J) = qJ(J + 1), where q \u226a Bv=5 , the rotational\nconstant for the B(v = 5) state. [By convention, q is positive if the e level, with parity P = (\u22121)J , is at higher\nenergy.] In the absence of an electric field E, selection\nrules for the electric-dipole X \u2192 B transition ensure that\nthe laser light is absorbed only in the transition to one\nof the doublet levels. In the presence of E, the e and f\n\n\f2\n\n(A)\n+\n\nJ=1 (f)\nJ=1\u0003 (e)\n\nB(1)\n\nJ=1 (e)\n\nm=+1\n\nm=\u00011\n\nm=0\n\nX(0)\n\n(B)\nJ=1\n\nB(1)\n\nJ=1\u0004 (e)\n\nm=+1\n\nm=0\n\nm=\u00021\n\nX(0)\n\nFIG. 1: Stark modulation of the excited state energy levels,\nleading to a modulation of the transmitted light intensity.\nPlot (A) shows the Q1 transition and the absorption expected\nat E=0. In (B), with E large, the Stark effect mixes and shifts\nthe doublet levels. The difference in absorption is recorded in\nthe scans.\n\nlevels mix and are shifted by an amount \u2206\u03bd given by:\n\u0015\n\u0014q\n2\n2\n(\u2206\u03a9 (J)/2) + (\u03b1E) \u2212 \u2206\u03a9 (J)/2 . (1)\n\u2206\u03bd = \u00b1\nHere the upper (lower) sign corresponds to the upper\n(lower) level in the limit E \u2192 0, and\n\u03b1 = \u03bcB(1) MF\n\nF (F + 1) + J(J + 1) \u2212 I(I + 1)\n, (2)\n2F (F + 1)J(J + 1)\n\nwhere \u03bcB(1) is the dipole moment of the B state, and\nF = J + I is the total angular momentum. In the limit\nof large E and small J, \u2206\u03bd \u221d E and the doublet levels\nare completely mixed. In this limit, the laser is absorbed\nwith equal strength by both eigenstates of the mixed doublet, and the repulsion of the doublet levels results in a\ncharacteristic broadening of the absorption spectral line\n(see Fig. 1). For a laser tuned to one of the unperturbed\ndoublet levels, by modulating E, maxima in absorption\nwill occur twice per period at the minima of E. The \u03a9doublet mixing leads to small shifts in the line centers, as\ndoes the slight residual Stark mixing with nearby rotational levels of opposite parity. Both of these small shifts\n(\u2264 50 MHz) are accounted for in the analysis.\nIn our measurements, an electric field E was produced\nusing two parallel 3.8 cm diameter gold foil electrodes\nspaced 0.6 cm apart in the cell. The laser light was linearly polarized parallel to E and traversed the vapor cell\n\nbetween the electrodes. A reference signal at \u03c9 = 2\u03c0 \u00d799\nkHz was amplified to produce a voltage V = V0 cos(\u03c9t),\nwhere V0 \u2248 800 V, across the electrodes. The transmitted light was detected with a photodiode and amplified.\nPart of the laser beam was diverted for a wavelength\nmeasurement (using a Burleigh WA-1500 Wavemeter),\nand the laser power reflected from the cell was monitored\nwith a second \"reference\" photodiode.\nThe transmitted signals were sampled at 1 MHz with\na 12 bit ADC and recorded for 4 s. The amplitude of the\nsignal at the 2nd harmonic of the reference was extracted\nfrom the digitized data. Then the laser frequency was advanced roughly 150 MHz by simultaneous adjustment of\nthe grating angle and diode current, and a new absorption measurement was taken. This cycle was repeated\nuntil a mode-hop occurred, yielding scans covering 15-30\nGHz.\nThe scans showed absorption features corresponding to 208 PbO, 207 PbO, and 206 PbO molecules making\nP -, Q-, and R-branch\nfrom the electronic\n\u00021 + \u0003 transitions\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\nground\nstate\nX(0)\n\u03a3\n(v\n=\n0,\nJ\n)\nto the excited state\n\u0002 \u0003\n1\nfor\nJ \u2032\u2032 = 0 \u2212 6. An\nB(1) 3 \u03a0 (v \u2032 = 5, J \u2032 ), with S/N >\n\u223c\nexample is shown in Fig. 2. Before analyzing the data,\nthe absorption amplitudes were corrected for the variation in laser power with frequency during a scan. We\nexpect residual variations in amplitude over the scan of\n\u223c 5%, based on observed fluctuations in the ratio between transmitted and reflected power (presumably due\nto interference effects in the cell windows). The statistical uncertainty in each measurement was estimated from\nthe fluctuations of the second harmonic out of phase with\nthe signal, and was typically a few times greater than\nthe shot noise in the photodiode signal. The largest signal was observed from the Q1 208 PbO line, with a peak\nS/N \u226575, corresponding to \u2248 4 ppm absorption. These\nscans were fit to extract the hfs constant and coefficients\nin the Dunham expansion, as described below.\nHyperfine structure in the B(1) state of 207 Pb0 arises\nfrom the interaction Hhfs = Je * A * I = Ak JeZ IZ +\nA\u22a5 (JeX IX + JeY IY ), where A is the hyperfine tensor,\nI = 1/2 is the nuclear spin of 207 Pb, Je is the electronic\nangular momentum, and the coordinate axes are defined\nin the body-fixed frame, with \u1e90 along the internuclear\naxis n\u0302. For levels with low J values in an \u03a9 = 1 electronic state, the hfs is dominated by the term in Hhfs\nproportional to Ak . The terms containing JX,Y induce\noff-diagonal mixing with states with \u03a9 6= 1, which are\nfar in energy for this Hund's case (c) molecular state.\nWe can thus write the energy shift due to hfs, correct to\nsecond order in Hhfs \u2248 Ak JeZ IZ , as\n\u2206Ehfs \u2248 F IJMF \u03a9|Ak JeZ IZ |F IJMF \u03a9\nX | F IJ \u2032 MF \u03a9|Ak JeZ IZ |F IJMF \u03a9 |2\n+\n.\nEF IJ \u2212 EF IJ \u2032\n\u2032\nJ =J\u00b11\n\n(3)\n\n\f3\nThe matrix elements are determined from:\n\u2032\n\nhF IJ MF \u03a9|JeZ IZ |F IJMF \u03a9i\n\u001b\n\u001a\n\u2032 p\nF +I+J F I J\nI(I + 1)(2I + 1)\n= (\u22121)\n1 J I\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u2032\np\nJ 1 J\nJ \u2032 \u2212\u03a9\n\u2032\n\u00d7 (\u22121)\n\u03a9.

[9], and taking into account the known\nnatural abundances of each Pb isotope. The line splitting\ndue to hfs in 207 PbO is clearly visible in two transitions,\ncorresponding to the Q1 and Q2 lines, in Fig.2. The unperturbed line positions of these hfs-split lines could be\nlocated initially by extrapolating from 207 PbO lines with\nhigher values of J, which exhibit much smaller hfs splitting. The sign of Ak is found to be positive by visual\ninspection of Fig. 2, using the following observations:\nthe largest peak, which is closest to the unperturbed line\ncenter, must arise from the F = J +1/2 state (see Eqn.5);\nand in addition, if Ak > 0 (< 0), then this line should\nlie higher (lower) in energy than the unperturbed line\ncenter.\nOnce the lines were assigned, each scan was analyzed\nwith a multiparameter fit in which the modulated absorption lines were approximated as as sum over second\nderivatives of a gaussian, with a separate gaussian for\neach value of mJ in the excited state. With the isotopic abundances fixed, several fit parameters were used\nto characterize the height and the width of the various\ntransitions; these included the ratio of P :Q and R:Q transition strengths, the value of \u03bcB(1) , the Doppler width,\nand a measure of the electric field inhomogeneity. To extract line positions, the energy E Z,A (v, J) of electronic\nstate Z (Z = X, B) with vibrational and rotational quantum numbers v and J, respectively, for the A PbO isotopic\nspecies was written as\n2\n\nE Z,A (v, J) =GZ,A\n+ BvZ,A J (J + 1) \u2212 DvZ,A J 2 (J + 1)\nv\n+ E X,A (v = 0, J = 0).\n\n(6)\n\nThe energies of the X state sublevels were taken from the\nprecise data of Ref. [9]. The B state values were determined by fitting, with separate values of the rotational\nconstants used for the \u03a9-doublet levels with e and f character. For 207 PbO, the hfs constant Ak was included as\nan additional fit parameter.\nAs described above, determination of Ak was the primary goal of our work. Fitting the data set yielded\nAk = 5.01(7) GHz, where the dominant uncertainty is\n\nTABLE I: Dunham coefficients YijB,208 , in cm\u22121 .

This value is in good agreement with the ab initio prediction in [2]. We also find\nGB,208\n= 24600.085(8) cm\u22121 , (where the uncertainty\nv=5\nis from the wavemeter absolute calibration specification,\nwhich we did not verify independently, and from the exB,208\ntraction of the line centers); Bv=5\n= 0.24939(20) cm\u22121 ;\nand \u03bcB(1) = 4(1) D. Our data is insensitive to the small\nB,208\nparameters Dv=5\nand q.\nThe shifts between the values of GB,A\nv=5 for the different\nisotopes arise from changes in both the rovibrational and\nelectronic energies. In order to separate these effects, it is\nnecessary to evaluate the absolute ro-vibrational energies\nof the B(1)(v = 5) and the X(0)(v = 0) states. We\naccomplish this using a Dunham expansion :\nE Z,A (v, J) = TeZ,A +\n\nX\n\nj\n\nk\n\nZ,A\nYjk\n(v + 1/2) (J (J + 1)) .\n\nj,k\n\n(7)\nHere the isotopic changes in rovibrational energy are\nZ,A\nZ,208 \u2212(j/2+k)\n,\ntaken into account by writing Yjk\n= Yjk\n\u03c1A\nwhere \u03c1A \u2261 \u03bc(A)/\u03bc(208) and \u03bc(A) is the molecular\nreduced mass of A PbO. The coefficients in the Dunham expansion are simply related to the previously deB,A\nscribed parameters. For example, GB,A\n+\nv=5 = Te\nP X,A\nP B,A\nj\nj\nY\n(0\n+\n1/2)\n.\nY\n(5\n+\n1/2)\n\u2212\nj j0\nj j0\nTo evaluate the rovibronic part of the isotopic shifts,\nX,208\nwe take the values of Yjk\nfrom Ref.[9]. The Dunham\nB,208\ncoefficients Yjk\ngiven in Table I were evaluated using\nthe data of Ref. [9] on the three lowest vibrational levels\n(v = 0, 1, 2) of the B(1) state, in combination with our\nB,208\ndetermination of GB,208\nv=5 and Bv=5 . Although inclusion\nof our data shifts the values of individual Dunham coefficients noticeably (as compared to their values using only\nthe data from Ref. [9]), the resulting change in the rovibronic part of the isotope shifts is small: <\n\u223c 100 MHz,\ncomparable to the uncertainty in our determination of\nindividual line positions. Due to our limited range in J,\nwe have negligible sensitivity to isotopic differences in the\nrotational constants.\nWith this determination of the rovibronic part of the\nisotope shift, it is possible to extract the isotopic shifts\nin the electronic energies.

In a second approach, line centers from two different isotopes were extracted with no constraints on their\nrelative positions or amplitudes. Subtracting off the rovibronic part of the separation expected between the lines\nfrom Eqn.7 gave consistent results for the electronic part\nof the isotope shifts.

This shift\nis unusually large, although similar shifts are known to\noccur in complex atoms [14].\nIn summary, we have measured some detailed spectroscopic parameters of the X(0)(v = 0) \u2192 B(1)(v = 5)\ntransition of PbO. The measured value of the B(1) state\nhfs provides an important data point for checking calculations of the effective electric field acting on an electron\nEDM in excited states of PbO.\nWe thank M.
