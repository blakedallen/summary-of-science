In this article we explain how critical points of a particular perturbation of the\nRabinowitz action functional give rise to leaf-wise intersection points in hypersurfaces of\nrestricted contact type. This is used to derive existence and multiplicity results for leaf-wise\nintersection points in hypersurfaces of restricted contact type in general exact symplectic\nmanifolds. The notion of leaf-wise intersection points was introduced by Moser [Mos78].\n\n1. Introduction\nWe consider a closed hypersurface \u03a3 \u2282 (M, \u03c9 = d\u03bb) in an exact symplectic manifold (M, \u03c9)\nsuch that (\u03a3, \u03b1 := \u03bb|\u03a3 ) is a contact manifold. Moreover, we assume that \u03a3 bounds a compact\nregion in M and that M is convex at infinity, that is, M is isomorphic to the symplectization\nof a compact contact manifold at infinity. \u03a3 is foliated by the leaves of the characteristic line\nbundle which is spanned by the Reeb vector field R of \u03b1. For x \u2208 \u03a3 we denote by Lx the\nleaf through x. Furthermore, we denote by Hamc (M, \u03c9) the group of compactly supported\nHamiltonian diffeomorphism. The following question was addressed by Moser [Mos78].\nQuestion. Given \u03c6 \u2208 Hamc (M, \u03c9), does there exist a leaf-wise intersection point, that is,\nx \u2208 \u03a3 with \u03c6(x) \u2208 Lx ?\nDefinition 1.1. We denote by \u2118(\u03a3, \u03b1) > 0 the minimal period of a Reeb orbit of (\u03a3, \u03b1)\nwhich is contractible in M . If there exists no contractible Reeb orbit we set \u2118(\u03a3, \u03b1) = \u221e.\nOur first main result is the following.\nTheorem A. If \u03c6 \u2208 Hamc (M, \u03c9) has Hofer norm ||\u03c6|| < \u2118(\u03a3, \u03b1), then there exists a leaf-wise\nintersection point for \u03c6.\nRemark 1.2. The case (M, \u03a3) = (R2n , S 2n\u22121 ) shows that Theorems A is sharp since \u2118(S 2n\u22121 )\nequals the displacement energy of the sphere S 2n\u22121 . In particular, the smallness assumption\nin Theorem A is necessary.\nThe proof of Theorem A uses a stretching of the neck argument for gradient flow lines of\na perturbed, time dependent Rabinowitz action functional. More sophisticatedly, using local\nRabinowitz Floer homology around the action value 0 we obtain the following multiplicity\nresult.\nTheorem B. For a generic Hamiltonian diffeomorphism \u03c6 \u2208 Hamc (M, \u03c9) with ||\u03c6|| < \u2118(\u03a3, \u03b1)\nX\nbi (\u03a3, Z/2) .\n(1.1)\n#{leaf-wise intersection points} \u2265\ni\n\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 53D40, 37J10, 58J05.\nKey words and phrases. Leaf-wise Intersections, Rabinowitz Floer homology, stretching the neck, local\nhomology.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nPETER ALBERS AND URS FRAUENFELDER\n\nIf the full Rabinowitz Floer homology is non-zero we obtain much stronger results. For the\nconstruction of Rabinowitz Floer homology we refer the reader to [CF09], see also Section 2.3.\nTheorem C. If the Rabinowitz Floer homology of (M, \u03a3) does not vanish, RFH(M, \u03a3) 6= 0,\nthen there always exists a leaf-wise intersection point for \u03c8 \u2208 Hamc (M, \u03c9).\nWe point out that we make no assumption on the Hofer norm of \u03c8. Moreover, as mentioned\nabove, without the assumption RFH(M, \u03a3) 6= 0 Theorem C does not hold in general.\nRemark 1.3. In the article [CF09] examples with non-vanishing Rabinowitz Floer homology\nare provided. See [CFO09] for further examples.\nRemark 1.4. The leaf-wise intersection points found in Theorems A and B are always contractible in the following sense. For any Hamiltonian function H : S 1 \u00d7 M \u2212\u2192 R such that\n\u03c6 = \u03c6H the leaf-wise intersection point can be completed to a loop \u03b3 by first following the\nflow of \u03c6tH and then the Reeb flow in such a way that \u03b3 is contractible in M , see Lemma 2.13\nbelow.\nRemark 1.5. As in Theorem B local Rabinowitz Floer homology around the action value\nof a non-contractible Reeb orbit can be considered. Similar techniques then lead to existence\nresults for non-contractible leaf-wise intersections points. In fact, generically each Reeb orbit\ngives rise to two different leaf-wise intersection points since the local homology is isomorphic\nto the homology of a circle.\n1.1. History of the problem and related results. The problem addressed above is a\nspecial case of the leaf-wise coisotropic intersection problem. For that let N \u2282 (M, \u03c9) be a\ncoisotropic submanifold. Then N is foliated by isotropic leafs. The problem asks for a leaf L\nsuch that \u03c6(L) \u2229 L 6= \u2205 for \u03c6 \u2208 Hamc (M, \u03c9).\nThe first result was obtained by Moser in [Mos78] for simply connected M and C 1 -small\n\u03c6. This was later generalized by Banyaga [Ban80] to non-simply connected M .\nThe C 1 -smallness assumption was replaced by Hofer, Ekeland-Hofer in [Hof90],[EH89] for\nhypersurfaces of restricted contact type in R2n by a much weaker smallness assumption,\nnamely that the Hofer norm of \u03c6 is smaller than a certain symplectic capacity. Only recently,\nthe result by Ekeland-Hofer was generalized in two different directions. It was extended\nby Dragnev [Dra08] to so-called \"coisotropic submanifolds of contact type in R2n \". Among\nother results Ginzburg [Gin07] generalized from restricted contact type in R2n to restricted\ncontact type in subcritical Stein manifolds. Moreover, examples by Ginzburg [Gin07] show\nthat the Ekeland-Hofer result is a symplectic rigidity result, namely it becomes wrong for\narbitrary hypersurfaces. Recently Ziltener [Zil08] and Gurel [Gur09] obtained results on leafwise intersection points using entirely different methods from this article.\nTheorem A gives a complete answer to the existence problem of leaf-wise intersection points\nwithin the class of restricted contact type hypersurfaces. After this article was published on\nthe arXiv an independent proof of Theorem A was given by Gurel [Gur09].\nTheorem B is (to the authors' knowledge) the first time that a general multiplicity result for\nleaf-wise intersection points in the Hofer-small case is proved. In the C 1 -small case multiplicity\nresults were obtained by Moser and Banyaga. In the special case of fibrations Ziltener [Zil08]\nproves similar multiplicity results to Theorem B.\nTheorem C is (again to the authors' knowledge) the first global (i.e. valid for all Hamiltonian\ndiffeomorphisms) existence result for leaf-wise intersection points.\n\n\fLEAF-WISE INTERSECTIONS AND RABINOWITZ FLOER HOMOLOGY\n\n3\n\nAcknowledgments.

A perturbation of the Rabinowitz action functional\nWe recall that \u03a3 \u2282 (M, \u03c9 = d\u03bb) is a closed hypersurface in an exact symplectic manifold\nsuch that (\u03a3, \u03b1 = \u03bb|\u03a3 ) is a contact manifold. Moreover, \u03a3 is assumed to bound a compact\nregion in M . We denote by R the Reeb vector field of \u03b1. Moreover, we define the vector field\nY by d\u03bb(Y, *) = \u03bb(*).\nLemma 2.1. The vector field Y is a Liouville vector field for (\u03a3, \u03b1), that is, LY \u03c9 = \u03c9 and\nY \u22d4 \u03a3. In particular, (\u03a3, \u03b1) is of restricted contact type.\nProof. Since \u03bb(Y ) = d\u03bb(Y, Y ) = 0 we compute LY \u03bb = d(\u03b9Y \u03bb) + \u03b9Y d\u03bb = \u03bb. Since the Lie\nderivative commutes with the exterior differential we conclude LY \u03c9 = \u03c9. If we assume that\nY \u2208 Tx \u03a3 then 0 = d\u03b1(Y, R) = d\u03bb(Y, R) = \u03bb(R) = \u03b1(R) = 1. This contradiction shows\nY \u22d4 \u03a3.\n\u0003\nThe flow \u03c6tY of the Liouville vector field is defined near \u03a3. We fix \u03b40 > 0 so that \u03c6tY |\u03a3 is\nb by G(\u03c6\nb t (x)) = t for all x \u2208 \u03a3. For 0 < \u03b4 \u2264 \u03b40\ndefined for all |t| \u2264 \u03b40 and define a function G\nY\nwe set\nb\nU\u03b4 := {x \u2208 M | |G(x)|\n< \u03b4}.\n(2.1)\nSince \u03a3 bounds we can choose a G : M \u2212\u2192 R which is locally constant outside U\u03b40 , coincides\nb on U \u03b40 , and such that G\u22121 (0) = \u03a3. Thus, the Hamiltonian vector field XG of G\nwith G\n2\nR1\nsatisfies XG |\u03a3 = R. Finally, we fix a smooth function \u03c1 : S 1 \u2212\u2192 R with 0 \u03c1(t)dt = 1 and\nsupp(\u03c1) \u2282 (0, 12 ) and set\nF (t, x) := \u03c1(t)G(x) .\n(2.2)\nTherefore, the Hamiltonian vector fields satisfy\nXF (t, x) = \u03c1(t)XG (x) .\n\n(2.3)\n\nWe recall the definition of the positive and negative part of the Hofer norm.\nDefinition 2.2. Let H : S 1 \u00d7 M \u2212\u2192 R a compactly supported Hamiltonian function. We\nset\nZ 1\nZ 1\nmin H(t, x)dt = || \u2212 H||+\n(2.4)\nmax H(t, x)dt\n||H||\u2212 := \u2212\n||H||+ :=\n0 x\u2208M\n\n0 x\u2208M\n\nand\n\n||H|| = ||H||+ + ||H||\u2212 .\nFor \u03c6 \u2208 Hamc (M, \u03c9) the Hofer norm is\n||\u03c6|| = inf{||H|| | \u03c6 = \u03c6H } .\n\n(2.5)\n(2.6)\n\nLemma 2.3. For all \u03c6 \u2208 Hamc (M, \u03c9)\n||\u03c6|| = |||\u03c6||| := inf{||H|| | \u03c6 = \u03c6H , H(t, *) = 0 \u2200t \u2208 [0, 21 ]} .\n\n(2.7)\n\n\f4\n\nPETER ALBERS AND URS FRAUENFELDER\n\nProof. ||\u03c6|| \u2264 |||\u03c6||| is obvious. To prove the reverse inequality pick a smooth monotone\nmap r : [0, 1] \u2192 [0, 1] with r( 21 ) = 0 and r(1) = 1. For H with \u03c6H = \u03c6 we set H r (t, x) :=\nr \u2032 (t)H(r(t), x). Then a direct computation shows \u03c6H r = \u03c6H , ||H r || = ||H||, and H r (t, x) = 0\n\u0003\nfor all t \u2208 [0, 12 ]. This finishes the proof.\nFrom now on we assume that H(t, *) = 0 for all t \u2208 [0, 21 ]. Then for F as in equation (2.2)\nthe perturbed Rabinowitz action functional is defined as follows\nZ 1\nZ 1\nZ 1\nF (t, u(t))dt\n(2.8)\nH(t, u(t))dt \u2212 \u03b7\nu\u2217 \u03bb \u2212\nAFH (u, \u03b7) := \u2212\nwhere u \u2208\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nC \u221e (S 1 , M )\n\nand \u03b7 \u2208 R. Critical points (u, \u03b7) \u2208 CritAFH satisfy\n\uf8fc\n\u2202t u = XH (t, u) + \u03b7XF (t, u) \uf8f4\n\uf8fd\nZ 1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fe\nF (t, u)dt = 0\n\n(2.9)\n\n0\n\nIn the following proposition we observe that existence of a critical point of AFH gives rise to\na positive answer of the leaf-wise intersection problem mentioned in the introduction.\nProposition 2.4. Let (u, \u03b7) \u2208 CritAFH . Then x = u( 21 ) satisfies \u03c6H (x) \u2208 Lx . Thus, x is a\nleaf-wise intersection point.\nProof. For t \u2208 [0, 12 ] we compute, using H(t, *) = 0 for all t \u2264 12 ,\nd\nG(u(t)) = dG(u(t)) * \u2202t u\ndt\n= dG(u(t)) * [XH (t, u) +\u03b7 XF (t, u) ]\n| {z }\n| {z }\n=0\n\n(2.10)\n\n=\u03c1(t)XG (u)\n\n=0,\n\nsince dG(XG ) = 0. Hence G(u(t)) = c =const for t \u2264 21 . Thus,\nZ 1\nZ 1\n0=\nF (t, u)dt =\n\u03c1(t)G(u(t))dt = c\n0\n\n(2.11)\n\n0\n\nTherefore, G(u(t)) = c = 0, and since G\u22121 (0) = \u03a3 we have u(t) \u2208 \u03a3 for t \u2208 [0, 12 ]. In\nparticular, u( 12 ), u(0) = u(1) \u2208 \u03a3.\nFor t \u2208 [ 21 , 1] we have F (t, *) = 0. Thus, the loop u solves the equation \u2202t u = XH (t, u) on\n[ 12 , 1], and therefore, u(1) = \u03c6H (u( 12 )). We conclude that \u03c6H (u( 21 )) \u2208 \u03a3.

Moreover, its\nboundary consists of the point (0, p, 0) only.\nAssuming the Claim we prove the assertion of Theorem A. The moduli space M is the\nzero-set of a Fredholm section of a Banach-space bundle over a Banach manifold. Its index\nequals 1. Moreover, since by Lemma 2.12 AF = AK0 is Morse-Bott along \u03a3 the Fredholm\nsection is regular at the boundary point (0, p, 0). It is well-known that a Fredholm section\ncan be perturbed to a transverse Fredholm section given that its zero-set is compact. Since\nthe Fredholm section is already transverse at the boundary point it suffices to perturb away\nfrom the boundary. Thus, assuming the claim we obtain from M a smooth compact manifold\nwith boundary being the point (0, p, 0). Such a manifold does not exists. Thus, to finish the\nproof it remains to show the claim.\nAccording to Lemma 2.7 we have for (r, w) \u2208 M with lims\u2192\u221e w = (p\u2032 , 0)\nZ \u221e\n||\u2202s Kr ||\u2212 ds\nE(w) \u2264 AF0 (p, 0) \u2212 AF0 (p\u2032 , 0) +\n=\n\nZ\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n=\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n||\u03b2r\u2032 (s)H||\u2212 ds\n\u03b2r\u2032 (s)||H||\u2212 ds \u2212\n\n= \u03b2r (0) ||H||\u2212 + ||H||+\n\u2264 ||H|| .\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n0\n\n\u03b2r\u2032 (s)||H||+ ds\n\n(2.39)\n\n\u0001\n\nMoreover, if r = 0 in the above then E(w) = AF0 (p, 0) \u2212 AF0 (p\u2032 , 0) = 0 thus w is constant\nand therefore w(s) = (p, 0) for all s \u2208 R. In particular, for r = 0 the only solution in M is\nw(s) = (p, 0). Finally, since AF0 (p, 0) = AF0 (p\u2032 , 0) = 0 the above computation implies\n\u2212 ||H|| \u2264 AKr (w(s)) \u2264 ||H||\n\n\u2200s \u2208 R .\n\nSince we have uniform action bounds we know by Theorem 2.9 that the sequence wn converges\n(after choosing a subsequence) to some solution v of the gradient flow equation. In case that\nv(+\u221e) 6\u2208 \u03a3 (the other case is analogous) we choose an open set U \u2282 L \u00d7 R containing only\nthe constant critical points. Let sn be the first time so that wn (\u03c3n ) 6\u2208 U , i.e. the first exit time.\nThis is well-defined for large enough n since v(+\u221e) 6\u2208 \u03a3. Now consider the reparametrised\n\u221e compactness the sequence u converges to u\nsequence un := \u03c3n \u2217 wn := wn (* + \u03c3n ). By Cloc\nn\n(after choice of a subsequence). Then u is a non-constant gradient flowline since u(0) \u2208 \u2202U\nand u(\u2212\u221e) = (p, 0) using again that \u03a3 is Morse-Bott, see Lemma 2.12. Thus, one of the\nfollowing has to exist\n(1) a non-constant gradient flow line v of AF0 with one asymptotic end being (p, 0),\n\u221e is as above.\n(2) a gradient flow line v of AF\u03b2\u221e H , where \u03b2\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\nMoreover, E(v) \u2264 lim sup E(wn ) \u2264 ||H|| < \u2118(\u03a3, \u03b1). In the first case the sequence rn converges, whereas in the second case rn \u2192 \u221e. If there exists no leaf-wise intersection points,\nthen the second case cannot occur since otherwise one asymptotic end of v is a critical point\nof AFH which gives a leaf-wise intersection point according to Proposition 2.4.\n\n\fLEAF-WISE INTERSECTIONS AND RABINOWITZ FLOER HOMOLOGY\n\n11\n\nIn the first case not both asymptotic ends of v can be of the form (q, 0) \u2208 CritAF0 for\nsome q \u2208 \u03a3 since otherwise E(v) = 0 according to Lemma 2.7. Hence the gradient flow line\nwould be constant. Therefore, one asymptotic end of v is of the form (\u03b3, \u03b7) where \u03b3 is a Reeb\norbit (contractible in M ) of period \u03b7 6= 0. Thus, |\u03b7| = |AF0 (\u03b3, \u03b7)| = E(v) < \u2118(\u03a3, \u03b1), which\ncontradicts the definition of \u2118(\u03a3, \u03b1). This finishes the proof.\n\u0003\nLemma 2.13. For any Hamiltonian function H : S 1 \u00d7 M \u2212\u2192 R such that \u03c6 = \u03c6H the leafwise intersection point found in Theorem A can be completed to a loop \u03b3 by first following\nthe flow of \u03c6tH and then the Reeb flow in such a way that \u03b3 is contractible in M .\nProof. From the previous proof it follows immediately that for the chosen Hamiltonian\nfunction H the leaf-wise intersection point x = u(0), where (u, \u03b7) \u2208 CritAFH , can be completed\nto a contractible loop \u03b3. We observe that \u03b3(t) = \u03c6tH+\u03b7F (x) is a 1-periodic orbit of the\nHamiltonian function H + \u03b7F . If K is another Hamiltonian function with \u03c6 = \u03c6K , then\nH + \u03b7F and K + \u03b7F have the same time-1-maps \u03c6H+\u03b7F = \u03c6K+\u03b7F . Moreover, it follows\nfrom the existence of at least one contractible periodic orbit for the time-1-map of the flow\nt\nt\nt\n\u03c6\u2212t\nH+\u03b7F \u25e6\u03c6K+\u03b7F that the loop \u03c6H+\u03b7F (x) is contractible if and only if \u03c6K+\u03b7F (x) is contractible.\n\u2212t\nt\nThe existence of a contractible periodic orbit for \u03c6H+\u03b7F \u25e6 \u03c6K+\u03b7F follows from Floer's proof\nof the Arnold conjecture [Flo88a].\n\u0003\n2.2. The perturbed Rabinowitz action functional is generically Morse. We set\nH := {H \u2208 C \u221e (S 1 \u00d7 M ) | H(t, *) = 0 \u2200t \u2208 [0, 21 ]} .\n\n(2.40)\n\nThe specific time support of functions H \u2208 H is crucial in the proof of Proposition 2.4.\nFortunately, the set H still generates Ham(M, \u03c9), see Lemma 2.3. Moreover, it is large\nenough so that the perturbed Rabinowitz action functional is generically Morse.\nTheorem 2.14. For a generic H \u2208 H the perturbed Rabinowitz action functional AFH is\nMorse.\nProof. The proof is postponed to the appendix A.\n\n\u0003\nAFH\n\nRemark 2.15. It is straight forward to prove that\nis Morse if one does not insist that\n1\nH has time support in [ 2 , 1], see [CFP08]. The proof of the genericity of the Morse property\nfollows a standard scheme once it is shown that a certain linear operator is surjective. This\noperator is composed out of two summands. One is the Hessian of AFH and the other comes\nfrom the variation in H. Without restrictions on the time support surjectivity follows essentially directly from examining the second summand. In the situation of this paper this fails\nand we crucially use the Hessian.\n2.3. Rabinowitz Floer homology. The definition of Floer homology HF(AFH ) proceeds as\nusual. We choose an s-independent H : S 1 \u00d7M \u2212\u2192 R. In addition, we require that H(t, *) = 0\nfor all t \u2208 [0, 12 ]. Moreover, we assume that the perturbed Rabinowitz action functional AFH\nis Morse.

For example, one can use the theory of polyfolds by Hofer-Wysocki-Zehnder. In\nfact, since there are no automorphism groups acting, the framework of M -polyfolds [HWZ07,\nHWZ09] is sufficient to achieve transversality. Indeed, the space of broken trajectories is\nan M -polyfold and the gradient flow equation is a Fredholm section into an M -polybundle.\nThe moduli space M(c\u2212 , c+ ) is the zero set of this Fredholm section. Using the abstract\nperturbation theory developed in [HWZ09] then achieves transversality.\nIt also is conceivable that M(c\u2212 , c+ ) is smooth for a generic choice of an S 1 -family J(t, *)\nof compatible almost complex structures similarly as in the work of [FHS95].\nBy abuse of notation the smooth manifold obtained by perturbing the gradient flow equation will again be denoted by M(c\u2212 , c+ ). We set n(c\u2212 , c+ ) to be the Z/2-number of elements\nin the zero-dimensional components of M(c\u2212 , c+ ).

We choose an s-dependent homotopy from H to 0. Because of Theorem 2.9 the usual\ncontinuation homomorphisms are well-defined and isomorphisms.

We assume by contradiction that there exists no leaf-wise intersection points.\nparticular, by Proposition 2.4 CritAFH = \u2205 and thus AFH is Morse with 0 = HF(AFH )\nRFH(M, \u03a3). This contradiction finishes the proof.\n\nIn\n\u223c\n=\n\u0003\n\n2.5. Local Rabinowitz Floer homology. In the following we assume that \u03c6H \u2208 Hamc (M, \u03c9)\nis chosen so that AFH is Morse.

This follows from the Arzela-Ascoli theorem since\nthe Lagrange multiplier \u03b7 is uniformly bounded according to Lemma 2.11.

The second inequality is obvious. To prove the first inequality we point out that\ntwo critical points (u, \u03b7) 6= (u\u2032 , \u03b7 \u2032 ) \u2208 Crit(AFH ) can give rise to the same leaf-wise intersection\npoint only if the underlying leaf of the Reeb flow is closed. Indeed, if u( 12 ) = u\u2032 ( 21 ) then\naccording to Proposition 2.4 we know that u(1) = \u03c6H (u( 12 )) = \u03c6H (u\u2032 ( 21 )) = u\u2032 (1). Trivially,\nu(1) = u(0) = u\u2032 (0) = u\u2032 (1). This is illustrated in figure 1.

The linearized operator. We denote by Hk = {H \u2208 C k (S 1 \u00d7 M ) | H(t, *) = 0 \u2200t \u2208\n[0, 21 ]}. Moreover, for w \u2208 LH (see equation (A.6) for the definition) we define the bundle\nEH \u2212\u2192 LH by\n(EH )w := L2 ([0, 1], w\u2217 T M ) .\n(A.12)\nDefinition A.1. Let (v0 , \u03b70 ) be a critical point of AFH and (w0 , \u03b70 ) the corresponding critical\npoint of AeF\u03b70 ,H , that is, defined by the equation v0 = \u03a6\u03b70 F +H (w0 ). Then we define the linear\noperator\nL(w0 ,\u03b70 ,H) : (Tw0 L\u03b70 F +H ) \u00d7 R \u00d7 H \u2212\u2192 (E\u03b70 F +H )\u2228 \u00d7 R\n(A.13)\nvia the pairing with (\u01752 , \u03b7\u03022 ) \u2208 (E\u03b70 F +H ) \u00d7 R\nhL(w0 ,\u03b70 ,H) [\u01751 , \u03b7\u03021 , \u0124], (\u01752 , \u03b7\u03022 )i := HAeF (w0 , \u03b70 )[(\u01751 , \u03b7\u03021 ), (\u01752 , \u03b7\u03022 )]\n\u03b70 ,H\nZ 1\nd((\u03a6\u03b70 F +H )\u2217 \u0124)(t, w0 )[\u01752 (t)]dt\n+\n\n(A.14)\n\n0\n\nProposition A.2. The operator L(w0 ,\u03b70 ,H) is surjective. In fact, L(w0 ,\u03b70 ,H) is surjective when\nrestricted to the space\nV := {(\u0175, \u03b7\u0302, \u0124) \u2208 (Tw0 L\u03b70 F +H ) \u00d7 R \u00d7 H | \u0175( 12 ) = 0} .\n\n(A.15)\n\nRemark A.3. The additional assertion of the surjectivity of L(w0 ,\u03b70 ,H) |V is not used in the\ncurrent article but will prove useful in the future. Since it added only two lines we decided\nto include it here.\nProof. The L2 -Hessian is a self-adjoint Fredholm operator. Thus, the operator L(w0 ,\u03b70 ,H)\nhas closed image. Therefore, it suffices to prove that the annihilator of the image of L(w0 ,\u03b70 ,H)\nvanishes. Let (\u01752 , \u03b7\u03022 ) be in the annihilator of the image of L(w0 ,\u03b70 ,H) , that is\nhL(w0 ,\u03b70 ,H) [\u01751 , \u03b7\u03021 , \u0124], (\u01752 , \u03b7\u03022 )i = 0\n\n(A.16)\n\nfor all (\u01751 , \u03b7\u03021 , \u0124) \u2208 (Tw0 L\u03b70 F +H ) \u00d7 R \u00d7 H. This is equivalent to the following two equations:\nHAeF\n\n\u03b70 ,H\n\nand\n\n(w0 , \u03b70 )[(\u01751 , \u03b7\u03021 ), (\u01752 , \u03b7\u03022 )] = 0\nZ\n\n0\n\n1\n\n\u2200(\u01751 , \u03b7\u03021 ) \u2208 (Tw0 L\u03b70 F +H ) \u00d7 R\n\nd\u0124t (\u03c6t\u03b70 F +H (w0 ))[d\u03c6t\u03b70 F +H (w0 )[\u01752 ]] = 0\n\nSince the Hessian HAeF\n\n\u03b70 ,H\n\n\u2200\u0124 \u2208 H\n\n(A.17)\n\n(A.18)\n\nis a self-adjoint operator, equations (A.11) and (A.17) imply by\n\nelliptic regularity that \u01752 \u2208 C k+1 ([0, 1], M ) and satisfies the equation\n\u2202t \u01752 \u2212 \u03b7\u03022 XF (t, w0 ) = 0\n\n(A.19)\n\nand the linearized boundary condition\n\u01752 (0) = d\u03c61\u03b70 F +H (w0 )[\u01752 (1)] .\n\n(A.20)\n\nIn fact, when the Hessian is restricted to V then equation (A.19) holds for all t 6= 12 , since the\nHessian is a local operator. Thus, by continuity, equation (A.19) holds for all t in any case.\nFrom equation (A.18) we deduce that\n\u01752 (t) = 0 \u2200t \u2208 [ 21 , 1] .\n\n(A.21)\n\nUsing F (t, x) = \u03c1(t)G(x) we rewrite equation (A.19)\n\u2202t \u01752 \u2212 \u03b7\u03022 \u03c1(t)XG (w0 ) = 0 .\n\n(A.22)\n\n\fLEAF-WISE INTERSECTIONS AND RABINOWITZ FLOER HOMOLOGY\n\nThis is a linear ODE in the vector space Tw0 M which we can solve\n\u0013\n\u0012Z t\n\u03c1(\u03c4 )dt XG (w0 ) .\n\u01752 (t) = \u01752 (0) + \u03b7\u03022\n\n17\n\n(A.23)\n\n0\n\nWe recall (see equation (2.2)) that F (t, x) = \u03c1(t)G(x) where\nCombining this with equation (A.21) we conclude for t \u2265 12\n\nRt\n0\n\n\u03c1(t)dt = 1 for all t \u2208 [ 12 , 1].\n\n0 = \u01752 (t) = \u01752 (0) + \u03b7\u03022 XG (w0 ) .\n\n(A.24)\n\nCombining equations (A.20) and (A.21) at t = 1 we derive \u01752 (0) = 0. Hence, by equation\n(A.24) we have\n\u03b7\u03022 XG (w0 ) = 0 .\n\n(A.25)\n\nSince (w0 , \u03b70 ) comes from a critical point (v0 , \u03b70 ) of AFH we know G(v(0)) = G(w0 ) = 0, and\ntherefore, XG (w0 ) 6= 0 since 0 was assumed to be a regular of G. In particular,\n\u03b7\u03022 = 0\n\n(A.26)\n\nEquations (A.23) and (A.26) immediately imply\n\u01752 (t) = 0 \u2200t \u2208 [0, 1] .\n\n(A.27)\n\nTherefore, the annihilator of the image of Lw0 ,\u03b70 ,H vanishes and thus Lw0 ,\u03b70 ,H is surjective.\n\n\u0003\n\nA.3. Proof of Theorem 2.14. We recall that L = W 1,2 (S 1 , M ) and Hk = {H \u2208 C k (S 1 \u00d7\nM ) | H(t, *) = 0 \u2200t \u2208 [0, 12 ]}. We define the Banach space bundle E \u2212\u2192 L by Ev =\nL2 (S 1 , v \u2217 T M ). We consider the section S : L \u00d7 R \u00d7 Hk \u2212\u2192 E \u2228 \u00d7 R given by the differential\nof the Rabinowitz action functional AFH\nS(v, \u03b7, H) := dAFH (v, \u03b7) .\n\n(A.28)\n\nwhere the perturbation H \u2208 Hk is considered an additional variable. Its vertical differential\n\u2228\nDS : T(v0 ,\u03b70 ,H) L \u00d7 R \u00d7 Hk \u2212\u2192 E(v\nat (v0 , \u03b70 , H) \u2208 S \u22121 (0) is\n0 ,\u03b70 ,H)\n\u0002\n\u0003\nDS(v0 ,\u03b70 ,H) [(v\u0302, \u03b7\u0302, \u0124)] = HAF (v0 , \u03b70 ) (v\u0302, \u03b7\u0302, \u0124) ; \u2022 +\nH\n\nZ\n\n1\n\n\u0124(t, v0 )dt\n\n(A.29)\n\n0\n\nSince the pull-back of DS under the diffeomorphism \u03a6\u03b70 F +H \u00d7 idR \u00d7 idHk is the operator\nL(w0 ,\u03b70 ,H) in Proposition A.2, the operator DS is surjective. Thus, by the implicit function\ntheorem the universal moduli space\nM := S \u22121 (0)\n\n(A.30)\n\nis a smooth Banach manifold. We consider the projection \u03a0 : M \u2212\u2192 Hk . Then the AFH\nis Morse if and only if H is a regular value of \u03a0, which by the theorem of Sard-Smale form\na generic set (for k large enough). Moreover, the Morse condition is C k -open. Thus, for\nfunctions in an open and dense subset of Hk the Rabinowitz action functional is Morse.\nTaking the intersection of all k concludes the proof of Theorem 2.14.\n\u0003\n\n\f18\n\nPETER ALBERS AND URS FRAUENFELDER\n\nReferences\n[Ban80]\n[CF09]\n[CFO09]\n[CFP08]\n[Dra08]\n[EH89]\n[FHS95]\n[Flo88a]\n[Flo88b]\n[Fra04]\n[Gin07]\n[Gur09]\n[Hof90]\n[HWZ07]\n[HWZ09]\n[Mos78]\n[MS04]\n[Zil08]\n\nA.
