Our programme clusters span almost the whole range of the metallicity distribution of GCs\nand were selected to sample the widest range of global parameters (horizontal-branch morphology, masses, concentration, etc). In this paper\nwe focus on the discussion of the Na-O and Mg-Al anticorrelations and related issues. Our study finds clear Na and O star-to-star abundance\nvariations, exceeding those expected from the error in the analysis, in all clusters. Variations in Al are present in all but a few GCs. Finally,\na spread in abundances of Mg and Si are also present in a few clusters. Mg is slightly less overabundant and Si slightly more overabundant\nin the most Al-rich stars. The correlation between Si and Al abundances is a signature of production of 28 Si leaking from the Mg-Al cycle\nin a few clusters. The cross sections required for the proper reactions to take over in the cycle point to temperatures in excess of about 65\nmillion K for the favoured site of production. We used a dilution model to infer the total range of Al abundances starting from the Na and\nAl abundances in the FLAMES-UVES spectra, and the Na abundance distributions found from analysis of the much larger set of stars for\nwhich FLAMES-GIRAFFE spectra were available. We found that the maximum amount of additional Al produced by first-generation polluters\ncontributing to the composition of the second-generation stars in each cluster is closely correlated with the same combination of metallicity\nand cluster luminosity that reproduced the minimum O-abundances found from GIRAFFE spectra.

Introduction\nA growing body of evidence indicates that globular clusters\n(GCs) are not actual examples of simple stellar populations:\nwhen examined in detail, their stars are not coeval, nor do they\nshare the same initial chemistry (see the exhaustive reviews by\nKraft 1994 and, more recently, by Gratton, Sneden, Carretta\n2004 on this subject). The star formation in GCs included a second generation of stars born from the ejecta of the most massive\namong the stars of the primeval generation.

Even more complex might have been the environment for these events, possibly in the cores of giant clouds or\neven, in the case of the most massive clusters, of dwarf galaxies\n(Bekki 2006).\nMost of these events left behind a trace, represented by the\nchemical composition of the stars, that can be followed through\nquite subtle spectral features, like the lines of O, Na, and another few key elements such as Al, Mg, and possibly Si. This\nallows us to quantitatively probe the existence of a second generation of stars in GCs.\nThe best known among these tracers is the star-to-star anticorrelation between the O and Na abundances, which has been\n\n\f2\n\nE.

In the companion Paper VII we presented the Na-O anticorrelation derived for almost 2000 red giant branch (RGB) stars and provided a synoptic table with references to all the analyses. UVES spectra were only exploited\nup to now to measure the detailed chemical composition of\ntwo poorly studied, yet interesting bulge clusters (NGC 6441,\nGratton et al. 2006, Paper III; and NGC 6388, Carretta et al.\n2007b, Paper VI), for a total of 12 stars. In the present paper\nwe present the analysis of the other 202 RGB star with UVES\nspectra that are bona fide members in the remaining 17 clusters of our sample. We focus our discussion on the additional\ninformation they can provide about the proton capture process\n(the first three items listed above), while an in depth analysis of\nthe information concerning primordial abundances as well as\nstar-to-star scatter in Fe abundances will be presented in future\nworks. The most crucial additional data concern the Mg-Al cycle, which could not be observed on the GIRAFFE spectra for\nlack of Al lines. (We selected the two gratings including the O\nand Na spectral features most suited for abundance determination).\nThe outline of the paper is as follows. Criteria of target selection and observations are given in the next section; our procedure deriving the atmospheric parameters and the analysis\nare described in Sect. 3, whereas error estimates are briefly discussed in Sect. 4. In Sect. 5 we show the pattern of Na-O and\nMg-Al anticorrelations in all clusters, while Sect. 6 is devoted\nto extending and tuning the simple dilution model set up in the\ncompanion Paper VII, with a comparison with predictions from\nmodels of massive stars (both in main sequence and in the AGB\nphase). Finally, results are summarised in Sect. 7.\n\n2.

Second, since the metallicity is the well-known first parameter in shaping the HB morphology, we inserted GCs with\nmetal abundances from [Fe/H]= \u22122.4 to about [Fe/H]= \u22120.4 in\nour sample, spanning almost the whole metallicity range of the\nGalactic GCs. Both small and massive clusters are included in\nour sample, and finally all the age classes defined by Zinn, Lee,\nand collaborators (see e.g. Mackey and van den Bergh 2005)\nare represented well in the sample (see also Carretta et al. 2009,\nPaper VII). In Table2 we provide some information for the sample analysed here. After the cluster alternate name we list the\nnumber of member stars observed, together with their average\neffective temperature and the mean S /N per pixel, estimated\naround 6200 \u00c5.\nStar selection- The target selection within a given cluster fol-\n\nlowed the same criteria already illustrated for the previous GCs.\nWe chose stars free of any companion brighter than V + 2 mag\nwithin a 2.5 arcsec radius, or brighter than V \u2212 2 mag within 10\narcsec, with V the target magnitude. Stars near the RGB ridge\nline were primarily selected, while stars close to the RGB tip\nwere avoided to reduce problems related to model atmospheres.\nWe used two fibre configurations to maximize the number of\npossible target observed with UVES dedicated fibres (up to a\nmaximum of seven, plus one pointing to the sky) while observing the bulk of programme stars with the GIRAFFE instrument.\nThe constraints due to mechanical limitations in the Oz-Poz fibre positioner for FLAMES, coupled with the clusters sizes on\nthe sky, restricted observations to stars at some distance from\nthe clusters centres. However, these circumstances did not increase the risk of including field interlopers much except for\nthe disc cluster NGC 6171 (M 107), where we found that only\nfive UVES fibres targeted cluster member stars. Relevant information for all individual target stars (cluster, star identification,\ncoordinates, magnitudes, and heliocentric radial velocities) are\ngiven in Table 3 (on-line).\nPhotometry and astrometry- We used the available optical\n\nOur observations were collected in Service Mode at the\nESO VLT-UT2 telescope under programmes 072.D-0507\nand 073.D-0211 using the high-resolution multifibre facility\nFLAMES (Pasquini et al. 2002). In Table 1 we list the log of\nobservations for each cluster; date and time of beginning of\nthe observations are UT, exposure times are in seconds. The\nreported airmass is the one at the start of each exposure. The\nUVES Red Arm fed by FLAMES fibres provides a wavelength\ncoverage from 4800 to 6800 \u00c5 with a resolution of R \u2243 40, 000.\n\nphotometry, calibrated to the standard Johnson-Cousins system, for our target selection. The adopted photometric and astrometric data are discussed in Carretta et al. (2006, Paper I) for\nNGC 2808, in Carretta et al. (2007a, Paper II) for NGC 6752,\nin Carretta et al. (2007c, Paper IV) for NGC 6218 (M 12), and\nin Carretta et al. (2009, Paper VII) for the remaining clusters\nanalysed here. The K magnitudes used for the determination\nof effective temperature and surface gravity (see next section)\nare from the 2MASS Point Source Catalogue (Skrutskie et al.\n2006). Optical and near IR magnitudes are listed in Table 3.\n\nCluster selection- The first criterion adopted was to select\n\nSpectroscopic\n\nclusters with a wide range of distribution of stars along the HB,\n\ndata preparation- We used the onedimensional, wavelength-calibrated, reduced spectra from\n\n\f4\n\nE.

Radial velocities\n(RVs) were measured for each individual spectrum using\nmany lines with the IRAF2 package RVIDLINES. Using these\nRVs the spectra were shifted to zero RV and co-added for\neach star. The resulting heliocentric RVs and associated errors\n(typically a few hundred m s\u22121 ) are indicated in Table 3 for\nindividual member stars; average values for each programme\ncluster (with 1\u03c3 rms scatters) are listed in Table 2 with\nthe values from the Harris (1996) updated catalogue, as a\ncomparison.

Atmospheric parameters and analysis\n\n3.1. Atmospheric parameters\nTemperatures and gravities were derived for all stars using the\nsame procedure described in detail in the previous papers of\nthe series (see Papers II to VII) to which we refer the reader.\nThe only exception was NGC 2808 (Paper I). For this cluster,\nthe first analysed, temperatures were obtained only from V \u2212 K\ncolours and the Alonso et al. (1999) calibration, without using the second step of deriving the final adopted temperatures\nfrom a T eff versus magnitude relation. For self-consistency, we\nused here the same temperature derivation also for stars in\nNGC 2808 observed with UVES that, furthermore, were all observed with both instruments.Surface gravities were obtained\nfrom the position of stars in the colour-magnitude diagram.\nMicroturbulent velocities, vt , were derived by eliminating\ntrends in the relation between abundances from Fe neutral lines\nand expected line strength (see Magain 1984). Final metallicities were obtained by interpolating the model with the proper\natmospheric parameters whose abundance matched the one derived from Fe i lines in the Kurucz (1993) grid of model atmospheres (with overshooting on).\nAdopted atmospheric parameters, along with iron abundances derived from neutral and singly ionised lines, are listed\n\n\fE.

All quantities are plotted as a function of the effective\ntemperature.\nin Table 4 (completely available only in electronic form at\nCDS) for all the 202 stars with UVES spectra analysed in the\n17 GCs of the present work.\n\n3.2. Equivalent widths and iron abundances\nThe adopted line lists, atomic parameters, and reference solar abundances (from Gratton et al. 2003) are strictly homogeneous for all stars analysed in all clusters of the present\nprogramme. We stress that this is the remarkable strength of\nthe project, aimed at obtaining an extensive database of stellar\nabundances derived in the most homogeneous way for a significant part of the galactic GC population.\nEquivalent widths were measured with the same automatic procedure as we used in the analysis of GIRAFFE spectra (Papers I, II, VI, V, VII; see the detailed description in\nBragaglia et al. 2001 for the definition of the local continuum\naround each line). Stars observed in each cluster with both instruments were used to register the EWs from GIRAFFE spectra to those measured here on the higher resolution UVES spectra (see also the discussion in Paper VII), using linear relations\nto correct the EWs.\nAfter this correction onto the UVES system is applied,\nEWs from GIRAFFE spectra agree very well with those mea-\n\n5\n\nsured even in extremely high-resolution spectra with quite high\nS /N (see a lengthier discussion in Paper II, section 2.2).\nAverage abundances of iron derived from UVES spectra\nfor the 17 programme clusters are summarised in Table 5,\nwhere we include also the 2 bulge clusters (NGC 6388 and\nNGC 6441) previously analysed in Papers III and VI. Beside\nthe number of stars for each cluster, we list in this table the average value of [Fe/H] with two attached errors: the first is the\nstatistical error and the second represents the systematic error\nrelated to the various assumptions we made in the analysis (see\nbelow, next section)3 . The rms scatter about the mean is given\nin the next column of Table 5.\nThe average slope \u2206\u03b8 of the relation between abundances\nfrom Fe i lines and excitation potential and the average slope\nin the relation of the expected line strength versus Fe i (used\nto derive the microturbulent velocity) are given in the next two\ncolumns, each with its statistical error attached. Individual values of these slopes are plotted as a function of the adopted effective temperature in the first two panels of Fig. 1 which summarises our analysis of iron abundances in the 17 programme\nclusters. Panel (a) shows how well the microturbulent velocity\nis constrained by our using several tens of Fe i lines and the\nexpected line strength: the average value is 0.002 \u00b1 0.001 with\nrms = 0.012 from 202 stars, stable even when a 2.5\u03c3\u2212clipping\nis applied. Panel (b) in Fig. 1 displays the slopes of the relation\nbetween abundances from neutral Fe i lines and excitation potential for each analysed star. There is a slight trend toward\nmore negative value for lower metallicity stars, the average\nvalue for the 202 stars being \u22120.013 \u00b1 0.002 with rms = 0.029,\nwhich implies that we derive temperatures from colours about\n45 K higher than those we would derive from the iron excitation equilibrium. However, after excluding 32 outliers with a\n2.5\u03c3\u2212clipping, the average slope becomes only \u22120.004 \u00b10.001\n(with rms = 0.013), corresponding to an offset in temperature\nof only about 14 K.\nTo plot the metal abundance of single stars for all clusters, we subtracted the average metallicity of the parent cluster\nfrom each star. The results are plotted in panel (c) of Fig. 1 and\nshow no trend whatsoever as a function of the temperature (on\na range of \u223c 1000 K), the mean difference being 0.000 \u00b1 0.004\nwith rms = 0.050 dex, after 3 outliers were eliminated by a\n2.5\u03c3\u2212clipping.\nFinally, the last two columns of Table 5 list the average\n[Fe ii/Fe i] ratio for each cluster and its rms scatter of the mean.\nIndividual values are plotted in the last panel (d) of Fig. 1 and\nthe average value from 191 stars left after the usual clipping\nof outliers is \u22120.004 \u00b1 0.003 (rms = 0.042 dex). This difference is obviously negligible and it indicates that the iron ionisation equilibrium is perfectly matched by our present abundance analysis. In turn, since surface gravities are derived from\nthe position in the colour-magnitude diagram, this evidence\nsupports the assumptions we made in the analysis very well,\n3\n\nAs discussed in Paper IV these systematic errors only include uncertainties in the average cluster abundances. Limitations due to e.g.\nthe grid of model atmospheres used or to the reference solar abundances, which apply to all clusters, are not included.\n\n\f6\n\nE.

In the upper panel the comparison\nis done for neutral iron, while abundances from singly ionised\nspecies are used in the lower panel. All data points lie within 1\u03c3\nrms on the line of equal abundance, convincingly showing how\nhomogeneous are our final metallicities. We therefore consider\nthat the samples of stars observed with both the GIRAFFE and\nUVES spectrographs can be safely merged, as done in Paper\nVII to increase statistics and study the properties of stars belonging to different stellar generations in GCs.\n\nserved also with GIRAFFE. Since the temperature range is\nquite similar for the two samples, we adopted the sensitivities\nfor the elements Fe i, Fe ii, O, and Na from Paper VII. For the\nelements not studied in that work (i.e., Mg, Al, and Si), we\nobtained the new sensitivity values by repeating our abundance\nanalysis for each star and changing only one atmospheric\nparameter each time. For every cluster the adopted sensitivity\nto each parameter is the average of what results from the\nindividual stars. In doing so, we also checked that the slope\nabundance/parameters for iron were similar to those obtained\nfrom GIRAFFE spectra.

This\nis good proof of the soundness of our approach.\nFor the other clusters, errors in T eff and gravity are as previously estimated in Paper VII\nErrors in metallicity do change because they are estimated\nfrom the rms scatter in [Fe/H] of all analysed stars.\nErrors in vt are generally less than those from GIRAFFE\nspectra due to the much larger number of Fe i lines used to\nestimate the microturbulent velocity\nErrors from uncertainties in the measurement of EWs are\nlower, since they were obtained from the rms in Fe i divided\nby the square root of the typical number of measured lines,\nusually higher in UVES spectra, in particular in the case of\niron.\n\nFinally, in Table 8 we show the errors in the abundances of\nFe (from neutral and singly ionised species), O, Na, Mg, Al,\nand Si as due to uncertainties in each atmospheric parameter\n\nand to errors in the EW measurement. The sums in quadrature\nof the three major (T eff , vt , EW) or of all error sources (last two\ncolumns in Table 8) represent the expected typical star-to-star\nerror in each abundance ratio.\nThe observed scatter in Fe abundances will be compared to\nerrors in a forthcoming paper. We only note here that as far as\niron is concerned, this scatter is generally very small, so that\nthe GCs can be still considered as monometallic aggregates. In\nturn, the implication is that products of supernovae nucleosynthesis must be very well mixed in the gas from which any protocluster started to form its stars. This is an inescapable constraint\nand requisite for any theoretical model of GCr formation.\nSummarising, typical star-to-star errors for the 17 clusters\nin the present work are on average 0.088 dex in [O/Fe], 0.061\ndex in [Na/Fe], 0.070 dex in [Mg/Fe], 0.078 dex in [Al/Fe], and\n0.049 dex in [Si/Fe].\n\n\f8\n\nE.

We used a synthetic spectrum\ntemplate (as described in Paper I) to clean each individual star\nspectra from telluric contamination by H2 O and O2 lines in\nthe region around the oxygen line at 6300.3 \u00c5. The spectra\nwere then shifted to zero RV and coadded. On the basis of previous experience, we consider as negligible the contributions\nto the measured oxygen EW due to the high excitation Ni i\nline at 6300.34 \u00c5 and CO formation in our programme stars.\nFurthermore, as discussed in Papers III and VI, even when\npresent these effects have opposite signs and compensate each\nother.\nThe Na abundances, derived from the doublets at 568288 \u00c5 and 6154-60 \u00c5, were corrected for effects of departures\nfrom the LTE assumption using the prescriptions by Gratton et\nal. (1999). Mg abundances are typically based on two to three\nhigh excitation lines (Mg i 5711.09, 6318.71 and 6319.24 \u00c5)\nand Al abundances are all derived from the subordinate doublet\nat 6696-98 \u00c5, the only one lying in the spectral region covered\nby UVES red arm spectra. The Si abundances are presented\nhere because we found that in some clusters this element is\npartly involved, actually produced, in proton-capture reactions\n(see below)4 . The Si abundances are from EWs of several transitions in the spectral range 5645-6145 \u00c5; atomic parameters\nare from Gratton et al. (2003).\nIn Table 9 we list the abundances for the elements involved\nin proton-capture reactions at high temperature, derived for all\nstars with UVES spectra in the 17 programme clusters (the\ncomplete table is available only in electronic form at CDS).\nThe table gives for each star the identification, the number of\nlines used, the abundance ratios, and the rms values; for O and\nAl, we distinguish between actual detections and upper limits.\nWe list in Table 10 the average abundances of O, Na, Mg,\nAl, and Si, together with the number of stars in each cluster\nand the 1\u03c3 rms scatter of the mean.

Element\nratios from field stars are from literature studies, mainly from\nthe collection by Venn et al. (2004), and from abundance analyses not used by the Venn et al. compilation: Gratton et al.\n(2003), Fulbright et al. (2007), Reddy et al. (2003), Fulbright\n(2000), Johnson (2002), Jonsell et al. (2005), Gehren et al.\n(2006). The rms scatters associated in each study with abundances of field stars are typically less than a few hundredths of\na dex, much smaller than those derived for the average abundances found in GCs for these elements.\nFrom Table 10 and Fig. 3, it is possible to appreciate how\ncluster stars differ from their analogues in the galactic fields (irrespective of their belonging to the halo, disc, and bulge components). At every metallicity, the oxygen abundances are depleted on average and those of Na and Al are enhanced in GCs,\n\n[Mg/Fe]\n(dex)\n+0.52\n+0.45\n+0.28\n+0.20\n+0.34\n+0.35\n+0.41\n+0.55\n+0.51\n+0.52\n+0.49\n+0.21\n+0.46\n+0.34\n+0.50\n+0.47\n+0.49\n+0.45\n+0.51\n\nrms\n\nn\n\nrms\n\nn\n\n11\n10\n8\n12\n13\n13\n14\n14\n5\n11\n10\n7\n\n[Al/Fe]\n(dex)\n+0.52\n+0.40\n+0.64\n+0.40\n+0.14\n+0.74\n+0.27\n+0.60\n+0.39\n+0.20\n+0.41\n+0.69\n\n0.03\n0.03\n0.06\n0.25\n0.04\n0.06\n0.07\n0.03\n0.04\n0.04\n0.04\n0.07\n0.04\n0.09\n0.05\n0.10\n0.04\n0.19\n0.04\n\n0.17\n0.09\n0.41\n0.49\n0.38\n0.18\n0.29\n0.05\n0.07\n0.18\n0.37\n0.24\n\n5\n14\n14\n12\n13\n10\n\n+0.30\n+0.41\n+0.49\n+0.50\n+0.57\n+0.77\n\n0.15\n0.33\n0.32\n0.15\n0.26\n0.32\n\n11\n10\n10\n12\n13\n13\n14\n14\n5\n11\n14\n7\n13\n5\n14\n14\n12\n10\n9\n\n[Si/Fe]\n(dex)\n+0.40\n+0.37\n+0.29\n+0.28\n+0.30\n+0.40\n+0.30\n+0.52\n+0.53\n+0.35\n+0.28\n+0.32\n+0.34\n+0.33\n+0.38\n+0.38\n+0.38\n+0.43\n+0.34\n\nrms\n0.02\n0.03\n0.03\n0.05\n0.05\n0.05\n0.05\n0.06\n0.08\n0.06\n0.05\n0.10\n0.05\n0.11\n0.05\n0.06\n0.06\n0.10\n0.07\n\nwith respect to the same ratios in field stars. The abundances\nof all these elements show large star-to-star variations that are\nnot an effect of the analysis, but reflect a true change in chemical composition in a large fraction of stars (see also Paper VII).\nDifferences between GCs and field populations are much less\nfor Mg and Si, which also show much less spread. The smaller\nscatter for Mg and Si with respect to Al is in part an effect of\ntheir much larger primordial abundance; however, it also signals that only a fraction of the original Mg is transformed into\nAl and Si in the case of the Mg-Al cycle, at variance with the\ncase of the Ne-Na cycle, where almost all 22 Ne is transformed\ninto 23 Na. In turn, this is partly because of the higher temperature required for the reactions to occur in the two cycles (25\nMK and 70 MK, respectively), and of complexity of the MgAl cycle itself (some of the original 24 Mg is transformed into\n25\nMg and 26 Mg, rather than in 27 Al: see Yong et al. 2003). We\ncome back to this point in next section.\nOn the other hand, if we consider the envelopes of the abundance distributions (upper for O and Mg; lower for Na, Al, and\nSi), we find good agreement between the abundances for the\nGCs and those for the field stars. This suggests that the abundances of the primordial population in GCs are close to those\nof the field stars -see also the right panels of Fig. 3, where the\nentire range of abundances in each cluster is shown. On the\n\n\f10\n\nE. Carretta et al.: Proton-capture elements in 17 globular clusters\n\nwhole, these are not new results (see e.g. Gratton et al. 2000\nfor a discussion of abundance variations in light elements in\nfield stars as opposed to cluster stars), but in our study this\ncomparison is based for the first time on a sample of cluster\nstars comparable in size with the samples of field stars. There\nare, however, subtler points that should be discussed, such as\nthe large spread of the minimum values of [Al/Fe] ratios in the\nvarious clusters. We will re-examine this point in more detail\nin a forthcoming paper.\n\n5.1. The Na-O anticorrelation\nThe present UVES spectra clearly reveal the classical anticorrelations between proton-capture elements, in spite of the limited\nnumber of UVES fibres available in each pointing that hampers a statistically meaningful study like the one on GIRAFFE\ndata. In Fig. 4 we show the Na-O anticorrelations we obtain\nusing only UVES observations for the 19 clusters observed\nwithin our programme (data from this paper, complemented by\nthose for NGC 6441 from Paper III and NGC 6388 from Paper\nVI). Expected star-to-star error bars are plotted in each panel.\nAlthough limited in number in each cluster, these additional\ndata are very useful in some cases: as explained in the companion Paper VII, the higher resolution and quality of UVES spectra are crucial where only a few upper limits in O abundances\nwere extracted from a total of more than a hundred stars observed with GIRAFFE spectra, as happened for NGC 6397. In\nfact, the extreme homogeneity of our whole procedure allows\nthe two sample of stars with UVES and GIRAFFE spectra to be\nsafely merged, with gain in statistics. In Paper VII, whenever\npossible we replaced/complemented O and Na abundances obtained from GIRAFFE spectra with those from the UVES ones\nwhen studying the different stellar populations in GCs.\nThe global Na-O anticorrelation from UVES spectra for\nall programme clusters is plotted in the left panel of Fig. 5.\nAverage error bars are also shown in this panel. The stars\nare colour-coded according to arbitrarily defined metallicity\nbins: stars of metal-rich clusters (\u22121.1 <[Fe/H] < \u22120.4 dex),\ngiants of clusters of intermediate metallicity (\u22121.8 <[Fe/H]\n< \u22121.1 dex), and finally stars in the most metal-poor clusters\n(\u22122.4 <[Fe/H] < \u22121.8 dex). In the Na-O plane we can see that\nmetal-rich clusters seem to start at the same average high oxygen values of the other GCs, but from a higher Na value, at the\nO-rich, Na-poor extreme of the anticorrelation. However, this\nis not surprising, because it is assessed that the plateau of minimum Na established by supernovae nucleosynthesis is a function of metallicity. It is higher for [Fe/H]> \u22121 dex, as is also\nevident from the literature data of field stars shown in Fig. 3.\nThe largest extension of the Na-O anticorrelation seems to be\nreached in intermediate-metallicity clusters. Unpolluted stars\n(likely first-generation stars) in the most metal-poor clusters\npopulate the same locus of unpolluted stars of GCs with moderate metal abundances; however, when the cluster metallicity is\nvery low, the stars do not seem to show very large O-depletion.\nFrom this sample alone, it is not clear whether (and how much)\nthis result might be affected by the difficulty of observing weak\nO lines in metal-poor, rather warm giants.\n\nFrom the left panel of Fig. 5 we can see that the low-O\n([O/Fe] <\n\u223c \u2212 0.4 dex) tail of the anticorrelation almost entirely\ncome from stars measured in two clusters, NGC 2808 (three\nstars) and NGC 3201 (two stars)5 . Actually, all EWs measured\nin these stars are upper limits and, from the quality of the spectra, we cannot determine at the moment what is the real O abundance. We note, however, that these three stars in NGC 2808\nalso have a subsolar [Mg/Fe] ratio (they actually define the lowMg tail in the Mg-Al anticorrelation shown in the middle panel\nof Fig. 5), hence they are all good candidates for having chemical compositions severely altered by nuclear reactions involving all the proton-capture chains. In contrast, the other O-poor\nstars in this region from NGC 1904, NGC 3201, and NGC 5904\ndo not show any strong depletion of Mg, falling not much below the average value of the respective clusters. Finally, the last\ntwo stars in the O-poor tail belong to the metal-rich and quite\nmassive cluster NGC 6388 (see Paper VI); also for these stars,\nthe Mg abundances are not exceptionally low, since very close\nto the cluster average.\n\n5.2. The Mg-Al cycle\nLet us start by considering the abundances of the three elements\ninvolved in the Mg-Al cycle for which we have data (Mg, Al,\nand Si). We might expect some degree of anticorrelation between Mg and Al, and possibly even between Mg and Si, if\nthe burning temperature is high enough. The central and right\npanels of Fig. 5 show the global anti-correlations that we derive from our sample of giants with UVES spectra. There is\na considerable scatter in these plots. The Mg-Al run presents\nthe same features already found by previous studies (see e.g.\nCohen and Melendez 2005; Sneden et al. 2004). The star-tostar variations in Mg abundances are limited to a range of about\n0.5 dex, in most cases much less, apart from very few exceptions; we stress that all the [Mg/Fe] values <\n\u223c 0.2 dex were\nchecked by eye inspection of the spectral tracings. In the case\nof Mg and Si, there is no obvious anti-correlation: rather, there\nis a global positive correlation.\nHowever, these global trends are only marginally instructive. In fact, there are large differences between individual clusters. Separate plots for each cluster provide much more insight.\nSuch plots are shown in Figs. 6 and 7 for the Mg-Al and the\nMg-Si relations, respectively. (In Fig. 6 NGC 6397 is excluded,\nsince we did not measure Al in its stars.) An inspection of these\nfigures reveals a few clear facts:\n\u2013 The maximum Mg and minimum Al and Si abundances,\nwhich should be indicative of the composition of the primordial population (see next section) may be significantly\ndifferent in different clusters. Although we observed only a\nlimited number of stars in each cluster, and in many cases\nwe were only able to derive upper limits to the Al abundances, there is little doubt that the minimum Al abundance\nmay vary by almost an order of magnitude from cluster to\ncluster. In the next section we examine this issue in more\n5\nThe other two stars below [O/Fe]= \u22120.4 dex are from NGC 5904\nand NGC 1904, respectively\n\n\fE.

On the other hand, maximum Mg and minimum Si abundances also change from\ncluster to cluster. Some cases are obvious, like the pair of\nclusters M 5 (NGC 5904) and M 4 (NGC 6121), for which\n\nsuch a difference has already been found in previous analyses (Carney 1996; Ivans et al. 1999, 2001).

These fine correlations can be well explained by different primordial overabundances of the \u03b1\u2212elements in the various clusters. In\na separate paper we will study the correlation existing between the overabundance of \u03b1\u2212elements and other cluster\nparameters. Here, we simply note that it justifies the global\ncorrelation of Mg and Si abundances.\n\u2013 In a few clusters, none of these elements show significant\nvariations. Such clusters are generally small and not very\nmetal-poor. Typical cases are NGC 6121 (M 4), NGC 6171\n(M 107), and NGC 288. We notice that all stars in these\nclusters have rather large Al abundances: this finding will\nbe expanded upon in a future paper.\n\u2013 In the remaining clusters, Al abundances show broad\nspreads. Clearly, these variations cannot be explained by\nobservational errors (see Table 8). Interestingly enough,\nthese are also approximately the same ranges of abundance\nvariations as seen in unevolved cluster stars (Gratton et al.\n2001), pointing to the same origin for the mechanism establishing the observed chemical pattern. Stars very rich\n\nin Al (with [Al/Fe]\u2265 0.8) show Mg depletion. This is not\nsurprising, because Al is about an order of magnitude less\nabundant than Mg in the Sun and even more in the primordial stars in GCs. Hence, when a significant fraction\nof the original Mg is transformed into Al (so that the Mg\ndepletion is detectable), Al production is comparatively\nhuge. These Al-very rich and Mg-depleted stars are present\nin clusters that are massive (like NGC 2808, NGC 6388,\nNGC 6441), quite metal-poor (like NGC 6752), or both\n(like NGC 7078=M 15: note that, in this last case, we\nonly have an upper limit to the Al abundance for the Mgpoor star). Hence, at variance with the Na-O anticorrelation, which is present in all GCs, the Mg-Al anticorrelation\nis present or particularly prominent only in massive and/or\nmetal-poor GCs.\n\u2013 The most extreme (low) Mg abundances have been detected\nin three NGC 2808 stars. Even these are actual detections,\nnot upper limits. We remind the reader that this is one of\nthe only two clusters showing a conspicuous component\nof second-generation stars with extreme composition (see\n\n\fE.

Again, this effect is limited to massive or\nmetal-poor GCs. We are aware of only one previous detection\n\nFig. 9.

We found that the global slope (0.07 \u00b1 0.02\nfrom 192 stars) is highly statistically significant.

An enlargement for the Si-Mg anticorrelation in these clusters, together with the slopes and associated errors, is shown in the\nupper part of Fig. 10. In the bottom two panels of this figure\nwe display the direct Si-Al correlations for the two clusters\nwith significant slope and no upper limits on Al abundances:\nNGC 2808 and NGC 6752.\nThe explanation for this behaviour is given by Yong et al.\n(2005) in their study of giants in NGC 6752. The authors claim\nthat such a correlation is expected if a \"leakage\" from the MgAl cycle on 28 Si does occur, and discuss how small amounts of\n29\nSi and 30 Si can even be synthesized by neutron\u2212capture processes in the He-shell of AGB stars. However, the total abundance of Si is unlikely to change significantly unless the reaction 27 Al(p, \u03b3)28 Si takes over the reaction 27 Al(p, \u03b1)24 Mg in the\n\nMg-Al chain. The result is that a certain amount of 28 Si might\nbe produced in hot bottom burning (HBB) in intermediatemass AGB stars by proton\u2212capture reactions (see Karakas\nand Lattanzio 2003), giving just the sort of trend displayed in\nFig. 10. Incidentally, the variation of Si abundances we found\nin NGC 6752 is exactly the same as that found by Yong et al.\n(2005).\nA strong conclusion that can be drawn from the above results is that only a fraction of the polluters responsible for the\nNa-O anticorrelation actually produce large quantities of Al.\nThis is likely to be related to the large difference between the\ntemperature required for the two cycles. The temperature where\nthe Mg-Al cycle occurs is high enough for a significant production of Si. As a result, the finding of the Si-Al correlation\nallows us to put a strong constraint on the temperature at which\nH-burning occurred in these massive clusters. By looking at\nthe temperature dependence of Maxwellian-averaged reaction\nrates from NACRE for proton-captures (right panel of Fig. 8\nin Arnould et al. 1999) we can evaluate that the reaction producing 28 Si becomes predominant in the Mg-Al cycle when the\n\n\fE.

Once again we then confirm\nthat the chemical pattern we observe in present-day cluster red\ngiants must already be imprinted in the gas by a previous generation of more massive stars. In currently evolving low-mass\nstars the CNO processing shell only reaches its maximum temperature of about 70 MK very near the tip of the RGB (e.g.\nLanger et al. 1996), while we observe stars still far from this\nmagnitude range and yet able to show the Si-Al correlation in\ntheir photospheric abundances.\n\n6.

In most cases there is a clear\ncorrelation between Al and Na abundances. However, in spite\nof the numerous upper limits for metal-poor or Al-poor stars, it\nis also clear that these runs are different from cluster to cluster.\nIn a few cases there is no appreciable change in the Al abun-\n\nTable 11.

As\nmentioned in Paper VII, this dilution model explains the shape\nof the Na-O anticorrelation (see also Prantzos et al. 2007). In\nthis model the logarithmic abundance of an element [X] for a\ngiven dilution factor dil is given by\n[X] = log [(1 \u2212 dil) 10[Xo] + dil 10[Xp] ],\n\n(1)\n\nwhere [Xo] and [Xp] are the logarithmic abundance of the element in the original and processed material, respectively. We\napply this model to Na and Al abundances. We notice that a\n\nbasic property of this model is that there should be a unique relation between Na and Al abundances in a given cluster. While\nthis indeed seems the case for most of the clusters, there might\nbe exceptions, the most notable being NGC 6254, for which\nthere seems to be a genuine scatter of Al abundances at a given\nNa abundance. Let us ignore this difficulty for the moment. In\nprinciple, [Xo] and [Xp] could be directly derived from observations for both Na and Al. However, the sample of stars with\nUVES spectra is quite small for a single cluster, and it is very\nlikely that the extremes of the distributions have not been well\nsampled. For Na, this concern can be removed by using the\nmuch larger samples of stars with GIRAFFE spectra: for Na we\nwill adopt the values of [Xo]=[Na/Fe]min and [Xp]=[Na/Fe]max\nfrom Table 7 of Paper VII. On the other hand, we can only\nuse the UVES data to derive [Al/Fe]min and [Al/Fe]max . Since\nwe could derive only upper limits for a number of stars, we\napplied a maximum likelihood method (see Isobe, Feigelson\nand Nelson 1986) to estimate [Al/Fe]min and [Al/Fe]max values,\nlisted in Table 11.\nDilution sequences obtained by this approach are superimposed on the observed run of Na and Al abundances in\nFig. 11. They generally do a good job of fitting the observations. However, there is a large scatter in the observational data\nfor some clusters (e.g. NGC 6254). We think that there are a\nfew cases where our dilution model is not fully compatible with\nobservations, most likely because we cannot assume a single\ncomposition for the polluters.\nIn our model, [Al/Fe]min represents the original Al abundance in the cluster. We plotted the run of [Al/Fe]min with\n[Fe/H] in Fig. 12. We obtain low values of Al abundances in\nthe most metal-poor clusters: in a couple of cases they are upper limits, because we did not detect Al lines in these clusters.\nMetal-rich clusters usually have very high values of [Al/Fe]min .\nOn the other hand, we find a huge range in Al abundances in\nclusters of intermediate metallicity. We will re-examine this\npoint in a forthcoming paper, but only anticipate here that most\nof this scatter can be explained by the origin of these clusters\n(disc or inner halo versus outer halo clusters).\nOn the other hand, [Al/Fe]max , or better the amount of Al\nproduced6, depends on the yields of typical polluters. It is then\ninteresting to notice that we found [Al/Fe]prod to be correlated\nwith a linear combination of metallicity and cluster luminosity, as shown in Fig. 13. This is true for all GCs in our sample\nexcept NGC 6838, which seems to have too large an Al production with respect to its metallicity and total mass. We have at\npresent no explanation for this cluster so we excluded it from\nthe fit. We note that this is the same combination of cluster\nmetallicity and luminosity that we obtained from a multivariate analysis of [O/Fe]min in Paper VII (see Fig. 20 there). The\nimplication is that the polluters that produced Al are actually\nthe same as destroyed O and produced Na, but that their properties change regularly with cluster luminosity and metallicity.\nThe dependence on metallicity is not surprising, since HBB\nis expected to occur at a higher temperature in more metal-poor\nstars (see Lattanzio, Forestini and Charbonnel 2000). These\nstars can produce Al and destroy O more efficiently. On the\n6\n\n[Al/Fe]prod = log (10[Al/Fe]max \u2212 10[Al/Fe]min )\n\n\fE.

[Al/Fe] ratios as a function of [Na/Fe] ratios for the 18 individual GCs, with a dilution model superimposed.\nother hand, cluster luminosity is probably a proxy for the cluster mass, and the latter might be a proxy for polluter mass. This\nmay be understood within the context that dynamical evolution of clusters occurs more rapidly in clusters of high mass\n(and luminosity). In this case, we should expect that the typical polluter mass is higher in more massive (and luminous)\nclusters. The trend towards increasing [Al/Fe]max and decreasing [Na/Fe]max and [O/Fe]min with increasing cluster luminosity should be a consequence of a similar trend with increasing\ntypical polluter mass.\nWe may compare this result with the very recent nucleosynthetic yields for AGB polluters by Ventura & D'Antona.\n(2009). We indeed find similar trends over the mass range 46 M\u2299 (the mass range changes somewhat with metallicity, the\nvalue we give is for Z = 10\u22123 ); however, the agreement is\nonly qualitative. In the models Al production and O destruction\nare not enough, and/or Na production is much too sensitive to\nmass. As a consequence, even playing with the minimum and\nmaximum mass of the polluters, we are never able to reproduce the abundances of all of these elements in any cluster.\nFor instance, in the case of NGC 2808, we may obtain a reasonably good production of Na and Al; adopting a mass range\n\nfor the polluters between 4.5 and 6.3 M\u2299 (and a Salpeter initial mass function -but this is not a critical assumption, given\nthe narrow range of masses involved) we obtain [Na/Fe]\u223c 0.6\nand [Al/Fe]\u223c 1.0, to be compared with [Na/Fe]max =0.56 and\n[Al/Fe]max =0.92. However, we get [O/Fe]\u223c \u22120.1, which is\nmuch larger than the observed value of [O/Fe]min = \u22121 (see\nPaper VII). In the case of NGC 6121, a slightly wider mass\nrange of the polluters (between 4.2 and 6.3 M\u2299 ) again reproduces the abundances of O and Na quite well ([O/Fe]\u223c 0 and\n[Na/Fe]\u223c 0.75, to be compared with [O/Fe]min = \u22120.2 and\n[Na/Fe]max =0.74), but it overestimates the production of Al\n([Al/Fe]\u223c 1 against [Al/Fe]max =0.65). We conclude that more\nimprovement in the models is required for such a comparison\nto be meaningful.\nWe remind the reader that there are a few clusters for\nwhich a unique dilution sequence does not reproduce the run\nof [Al/Fe] with [Na/Fe]. Examples are NGC 3201, NGC 6254,\nand NGC 6809, but there are other more dubious cases, like\nNGC 5904. This result is not new, since Johnson et al. (2005)\nfind a similar result for NGC 5272 (M 3). Such a result would\nsuggest that in these clusters there were more generations of\nstars, or perhaps even a continuum of second generations. This\n\n\f18\n\nE. Carretta et al.: Proton-capture elements in 17 globular clusters\n\nlast hypothesis would agree better with the massive star polluters, where each polluter might have its own progeny.\nLet us then consider the models for fast-rotating massive\nstars. We may use the yields given in Table 5 of Decressin et\nal. (2007), who give the predicted composition of the wind as\na function of stellar mass. These models predict a roughly constant Na production and a production of Al and destruction of\nO that are an increasing function of the mass. This might indeed agree with observations. However, a closer look reveals\nseveral inconsistencies. First, Al production and O destruction\nchange much less with mass than do the observed cluster to\ncluster variations in the maximum Al and minimum O abundances. This discrepancy becomes even worse if we consider\nthat stars over quite wide mass ranges should be taken into\naccount to provide enough mass for the second generation. A\nrange in stellar rotation rates is no help, as it yields a range in\nNa abundances, which is not observed. This is the same difficulty as was found for the AGB model, and it may point toward\nbasic problems in the relevant cross sections.\nThe rotating massive star scenario has an additional difficulty. In fact, in this scheme, material expelled from the polluting stars is not mixed into a single star-forming cloud, but\nrather second generation stars form around each of the fastrotating, polluting massive stars. We then expect different O,\nNa, and Al yields, depending on the mass and rotation rate of\nthe polluters. If we combine these different yields with a range\nin dilution factors, we expect that second-generation stars fill a\ntriangle in the [Na/Fe] versus [Al/Fe] plane, the vertices being\ndefined by the original [Na/Fe] and [Al/Fe] values, and by the\n[Na/Fe] and [Al/Fe] values given by the winds of the most and\nless massive fast-rotating star, respectively. The closer these\nlast two values, the less is the mass range allowed for polluters.\nWhile a range in polluter masses seem indeed present in clusters like NGC 3201 or NGC 6254 (or NGC 5272=M 3: see\nSneden et al. 2004), the sequences seem almost monoparametric in other clusters, including NGC 104 (47 Tuc), NGC 2808,\nNGC 6752 (see also Yong et al. 2003), or NGC 6205 (M 13,\nsee Sneden et al. 2004). More extensive samples of stars with\naccurate determinations of the Al abundances are required to\nclarify this issue.\n\nFig. 12. [Al/Fe]min versus [Fe/H] for the 19 GCs; the two upper\nlimits are for NGC 4590 and NGC 7078.\n\n7. Summary\nIn this paper, we have derived atmospheric parameters, abundances of Fe and of the elements involved in proton capture\nat high temperatures (O, Na, Mg, Al, and Si) in 202 stars in\n17 GCs. This analysis is based on FLAMES-UVES spectra.\nAdding the two clusters with similar data whose analysis has\nalready been presented in previous papers (NGC 6441: Paper\nIII; and NGC 6388: Paper VI), we now have a large data set\n(214 stars) from 19 GCs. This material complements results\nderived from the FLAMES-GIRAFFE spectra of about 2,000\nstars, as discussed in Paper VII, providing abundance analysis\nfor a sample of GC stars of unprecedented size.\nThe analysis of this huge dataset was done as automatically as possible. We put great care to reducing internal errors. Effective temperature were generally derived exploiting\nthe T eff \u2212 K magnitude relation within each cluster, calibrated\n\nFig. 13. Run of [Al/Fe]prod for the GC of our sample as a\nfunction of a linear combination of metallicity [Fe/H] and\ncluster luminosity MV . The relation was computed excluding\nNGC 6838.\nusing the relation between T eff and (V \u2212 K) colours. This allows us to minimise the impact of differential reddening (when\npresent), and to reduce star-to-star errors in the effective temperatures to a few K. This was crucial for enabling us to discuss\nstar-to-star abundance differences within each cluster.\n\n\fE. Carretta et al.: Proton-capture elements in 17 globular clusters\n\nData mining of this huge dataset is in progress. In the\npresent paper, we focused on the star-to-star scatter in the abundances of O, Na, Mg, Al, and Si. This was very important for\ndiscussing the relation between the Ne-Na and Mg-Al cycles.\nThe main results we obtained are as follows:\n\u2013 We confirm the very small scatter in Fe abundances found\nin Paper VII. Regardless of the mechanism responsible for\nthe variations in the abundances of O, Na, Mg, Al, and Si,\nit does not produce significant amounts of Fe.\n\u2013 As in paper VII, we found variations in O and Na abundances (anticorrelated with each other) in all surveyed clusters, including small ones like NGC 288, NGC 6397, or\nNGC 6838 (M 71). While minimum O abundances change\ngreatly from cluster to cluster, the maximum Na abundances show only a narrow spread. Clusters like NGC 288,\nNGC 6121 (M 4), and NGC 6171 (M 107) show no variation in the abundances of Al at all. This contrasts with the\nhuge spread in the Al abundances found in other clusters,\nlike NGC 2808, NGC 3201, NGC 6752. This clearly indicates that only a subset of the polluters responsible for the\nvariations of the O and Na abundances are responsible for\nthose of the Al abundances. That is, only a fraction of the\npolluting stars reached temperatures high enough for the\nMg-Al cycle to be active.\n\u2013 Significant variations in Mg and Si are seen whenever large\noverabundances of Al are observed. While the Mg depletion was expected in these cases, the observed overabundances of Si indicate that the \"leakage\" mechanism from\nthe Mg-Al cycle proposed by Yong et al. (2005) to explain\ntheir data for NGC 6752, is in fact active also in other clusters. This requires temperatures above 65 MK for the MgAl cycle.\n\u2013 We used a dilution model to derive minimum and maximum Al abundances from the Na-Al relation drawn from\nour UVES data, and minimum and maximum Na abundances obtained from the much more extensive GIRAFFE\nsample. These should reflect the primordial and polluter Al\nabundances, respectively. The peculiar run of the minimum\nAl abundances will be discussed in a forthcoming paper.\nHowever, from maximum and minimum Al abundances, we\nwere able to derive the Al produced within the polluters.\nThis was found to be correlated with the same combination of cluster luminosity (likely a proxy for the mass) and\nmetallicity that we obtained from an examination of the\nminimum O abundances in Paper VII. This indicates that\nAl production and O destruction are closely related, possibly indicative of a common dependence on the typical mass\nof the polluters.\n\u2013 A comparison of these results with current nucleosynthesis\npredictions from either massive AGB stars or fast-rotating\nmassive stars shows that in both cases a qualitative, but not\nquantitative agreement can be obtained. Further theoretical\nwork is clearly required.\n\u2013 Finally, we found that our dilution model satisfactorily explains most of the clusters. However, the spread in Al abundances at a given Na abundance found in a few clusters\n(the clearer example being NGC 6254=M 10) shows that\n\n19\n\nin some cases there was more than a single pool of gas\nfrom which second generation stars formed. We argue that\na careful and extensive study of the Na-Al relation may provide crucial information on the nature of the polluters.\nAcknowledgements.
