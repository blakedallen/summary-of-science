Fifteen Be/X-ray binaries and candidates in the SMC were observed serendipitously with the EPIC instruments\nof XMM-Newton during two observations of SNR 0047-73.5 and SNR 0103-72.6 in October 2000. A total of twelve of those\nsources are detected. For eleven of them an accurate position and in part detection of X-ray pulsations support the proposed\nidentification as Be/X-ray binaries. In one case the improved X-ray position excludes the previously suggested identification with an H\u03b1 emission line star found within the ROSAT error circle. The detection of pulsations (172.2 s, 320.1 s and\n751 s) from three hard X-ray sources with periods known from ASCA observations confirm their proposed identifications\nwith ROSAT sources and their optical Be star counterparts. In addition, pulsations with a period of 263.6 s were found from\nXMMU J004723.7\u2212731226=RX J0047.3\u22127312. For SAX J0103.2\u22127209 a pulse period of 341.2\u00b10.5 s was determined, continuing the large spin-up seen with ASCA, BeppoSAX and Chandra between 1996 and 1999 with a period derivative of \u22121.6\ns yr\u22121 covering now 4.5 years. The 0.3-10.0 keV EPIC spectra of all eleven Be/X-ray binaries and candidates are consistent with power-law energy distributions with derived photon indices strongly peaked at 1.00 with a standard deviation of\n0.16. No pulsations are detected from RX J0049.2\u22127311 and RX J0049.5\u22127310 (both near the 9 s pulsar AX J0049\u2212732)\nand RX J0105.1\u22127211 (near AX J0105\u2212722, which may pulsate with 3.3 s), leaving the identification of the ASCA sources\nwith ROSAT and corresponding XMM-Newton objects still unclear. We present an updated list of high mass X-ray binaries\n(HMXBs) and candidates in the SMC incorporating improved X-ray positions obtained from Chandra and XMM-Newton observations. Including the results from this work and recent publications the SMC HMXB catalogue comprises 65 objects with\nat least 37 showing X-ray pulsations.\nKey words. galaxies: individual: Small Magellanic Cloud \u2013 stars: neutron \u2013 X-rays: binaries \u2013 X-rays: galaxies\n\n1. Introduction\nX-ray observations of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC)\nwith recent observatories like ASCA, BeppoSAX, ROSAT and\nRXTE revealed a large number of Be/X-ray binary systems.\nMost of them were discovered through the detection of X-ray\npulsations (e.g. see summary of ASCA X-ray sources in the\nSMC Yokogawa et al. 2003), indicating the spin period of the\nneutron star which orbits an early type star. Optical follow-up\nobservations are then required to determine the spectral type of\nthe high mass star and in the SMC only Be stars were identified (with the only secure exception of the supergiant system\nSMC X-1), making the SMC very different to the Milky Way\nand the Large Magellanic Cloud in absolute numbers of high\nmass X-ray binaries with respect to the galaxy mass and also in\ntheir ratio of Be to supergiant OB systems.\nHaberl & Sasaki (2000,\nhereafter HS00) searched\nfor Be/X-ray binaries in the ROSAT catalogues of\nHaberl et al. (2000) and Sasaki et al. (2000) by correlating them with catalogues of optical H\u03b1 emission line objects\nSend offprint requests to: F. Haberl, e-mail: fwh@mpe.mpg.de\n\u22c6\nBased on observations with XMM-Newton, an ESA Science\nMission with instruments and contributions directly funded by ESA\nMember states and the USA (NASA)\n\n(Meyssonnier & Azzopardi 1993; Murphy & Bessell 2000).\nHS00 presented a list of 47 Be/X-ray binaries and candidates\nwith X-ray positions typically better than 10\u2032\u2032 . Since the\nlaunch of Chandra and XMM-Newton new X-ray pulsars\nand Be/X-ray binary candidates were discovered (Sasaki et al.\n2001, 2003; Macomb et al. 2003). Together with eleven pulsars\ndetected by RXTE with very uncertain X-ray positions we\nknow about sixty high mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) and\ncandidates in the SMC, from which more than thirty are known\nas X-ray pulsars (Yokogawa et al. 2003; Mereghetti 2001).\n\nThe position uncertainties of X-ray sources in the SMC obtained by previous missions of up to tens of arc-seconds (including the most precise ROSAT positions) made it in many\ncases impossible to uniquely correlate sources from the different X-ray missions, nor allowed exact optical identifications.\nWe therefore started to systematically analyse archival XMMNewton data of HMXBs and candidates in the SMC in order\nto confirm their proposed nature. First results were presented\nin Sasaki et al. (2003). Here we continue this work analyzing\nthe XMM-Newton EPIC data of two fields in the SMC which\ncontain in total fifteen known HMXBs and candidates.\n\n\f2\n\nHaberl & Pietsch: X-ray observations of Be/X-ray binaries in the SMC\n\n-73:00:00\n\n5\n05:00\n\n-73:10:00\n\n17\n\n4\n\n14\n\n9\n8\n\n7\n\n3\n\n15:00\n\n12\n\n-73:20:00\n\n11\n25:00\n53:00\n\n52:00\n\n51:00\n\n0:50:00\n\n49:00\n\n48:00\n\n47:00\n\n46:00\n\n44\n-72:10:00\n\n48\n\n15:00\n\n-72:20:00\n\n47\n43\n25:00\n\n[HS00]54\n\nFig. 1.

XMM-Newton observations and analysis\nXMM-Newton observed the fields around the SMC supernova\nremnants SNR 0047\u221273.5 and SNR 0103\u221272.6 on October 15,\n2000 and on October 17, 2000 with EPIC-MOS (MOS1 and\nMOS2, Turner et al. 2001) for 26.9 ks and 34.8 ks and EPIC-pn\n(Str\u00fcder et al. 2001) for 23.0 ks and 30.9 ks. For both observations the three EPIC cameras were operated in imaging mode\ncovering the full field of view of \u223c14\u2032 radius, MOS in fullframe (2.6 s time resolution) and pn in extended full-frame (0.2\ns) CCD readout mode. For optical light blocking the medium\nfilter was used in all cameras.\nThe data were processed using the XMM-Newton analysis\npackage SAS version 5.4.1 to produce the photon event files\nand binned data products like images, spectra and light curves.\nTo avoid artificial photon arrival time jumps in the EPIC pn\ndata an updated SAS development version from 2003, May 16\nwas used to create pn event files.\nThe observation of SNR 0103\u221272.6 suffered from strong\nbackground flaring activity (Fig. 1) which hampered the analysis of the data. We applied two different levels of background\nscreening depending on the goals of the analysis. To obtain\n\n08:00\n\n07:00\n\n06:00\n\n1:05:00\n\n04:00\n\n03:00\n\n02:00\n\nFig. 2. EPIC-pn images of the two observed SMC fields\nobtained from 1.0-2.0 keV data, using an intensity dependent adaptive smoothing (top: observation 0110000101 with\nSNR 0047\u221273.5 near the center of the image; bottom: observation 0110000301 with SNR 0103\u221272.6). The Be/X-ray binaries and candidates are marked with numbers as used in Table 3.\nSource 54 from HS00 was removed as Be/X-ray binary candidate from Table 3 because its improved position derived from\nthe EPIC data is now inconsistent with that of the emission\nline object proposed as optical counterpart. Sources 4, 8 and\n47 were not detected, while a possible association of source 8\n(detected with ASCA) with source 7 or 9 (ROSAT) could not\nbe clarified (see Sect. 2.1).\nclean images which also show faint sources we used only data\nfrom times of low background (<10 cts ks\u22121 arcmin\u22122 in\nEPIC-pn). To search for periodicities in the brighter sources\nwe used two different background cuts of 10 and 50 cts ks\u22121\narcmin\u22122 . While the strong screening removes the flares which\nhave typical time scales of a few 1000 s, the latter method\navoids too many data gaps. For the spectral analysis of point\n\n\fHaberl & Pietsch: X-ray observations of Be/X-ray binaries in the SMC\n\nsources the cut level of 50 cts ks\u22121 arcmin\u22122 was applied.\nFor the MOS data corresponding levels of 2 and 5 cts ks\u22121\narcmin\u22122 were defined, which result in similar good time intervals in the contemporaneous parts of MOS and pn data.\nFig. 2 shows the EPIC-pn images of the two observed\nSMC fields. The investigated Be/X-ray binaries are marked\nwith source numbers given in Table 3 which we use throughout\nthe paper. The fields of view of the MOS cameras are slightly\nshifted with respect to pn and do not cover the 345 s pulsar\nSAX J0103.2\u22127209 (source 44).\n\n2.1. Source positions\nSource detection based on sliding window and maximum likelihood methods available in the SAS package was applied\nto the MOS and pn images, simultaneously for four energy\nbands (0.3-1.0 keV, 1.0-2.0 keV, 2.0-4.5 keV and 4.5-7.5 keV),\nbut separately for the three instruments. Dividing the data\ninto several energy bands enhances the signal to noise ratio for sources which have their major part of emission in\na relatively narrow band, like e.g. super-soft X-ray sources\nor highly absorbed sources. In Table 1 we list the detected\nBe/X-ray binaries with XMM-Newton names, X-ray positions, count rates as obtained from the pn images (except for\nsource 5 which is located near a CCD border in the pn camera). Coordinate uncertainties include a 4\u2032\u2032 systematic error\n(Barcons et al. 2002). We correlated our source list with the\ncompilation of Be/X-ray binaries from HS00 and with the H\u03b1\nemission line object catalogue of Meyssonnier & Azzopardi\n(1993). Source 47 (Fig. 2) detected in ROSAT HRI data\n(Sasaki et al. 2000) was not detected by the EPIC instruments.\nAlso source 4 (Yokogawa et al. 2003) was not detected. The\nassociation of the 9.1 s pulsar AX J0049\u2212732 (source 8) with\neither of source 7 or 9 (Yokogawa et al. 2003; Filipovi\u0107 et al.\n2000b) could not be confirmed by a detection of the pulsations\nfrom either of the two sources in the EPIC data (see below).\nAX J0049\u2212732 may be an uncorrelated source detected during\na brighter state during the ASCA observations. HS00 classified\nRX J0105.7\u22127226 ([HS00]54) as candidate Be/X-ray binary\ndue to the positional coincidence with the emission line object\n1544 in Meyssonnier & Azzopardi (1993). Our newly derived\nX-ray position fully agrees with the ROSAT position, but the\nsmaller uncertainty now excludes an association with the emission line object. Since no other evidence argues for RX 0105.77226 as Be/X-ray binary, we remove it from the list of candidates. Similarly, source 48 is now very unlikely to be associated with [MA93]1517. This makes the situation concerning\nthe identification of the possible pulsar AX J0105\u2212722 with a\nROSAT source more unclear. However, the spectral analysis of\nRX J0105.1\u22127211 (see below) supports the HMXB nature of\nthe source and we therefore keep it as a candidate.\nThere remain eleven Be/X-ray binaries and candidates in\nthe two SMC fields for which we present a more detailed temporal and spectral analysis in the following.\n\n3\n\n2.2. X-ray pulsations\nWe searched for pulsations in the X-ray light curves (from\ndifferent energy bands and background screening levels)\nof all eleven Be/X-ray binaries and candidates using Fast\nFourier Transform (FFT) and Rayleigh Z2n methods. The\npower spectra obtained from broad band data (0.3\u22127.5 keV)\nof the three known pulsars in the field of SNR 0047\u221273.5\n(sources 11, 12 and 17) clearly reveal their pulse periods.\nThis - together with the accurate source positions - now allows the unique identification of the ASCA sources (which\nshowed pulsations) with ROSAT sources (good X-ray positions), which could previously be done on positional coincidence only. In particular RX J0051.9\u22127311 (source 17),\nwhich was suggested to be the counterpart of the 16.6 s\npulsar XTE J0050\u2212732#1 (Lamb et al. 2002b) or the 172\ns pulsar AX J0051.6\u22127311 (Yokogawa et al. 2003), is consistent in position with XMMU J005152.2\u2212731033, which\nshows 172.2 s pulsations. In addition we find 263 s pulsations from XMMU J004723.7\u2212731226=RXJ0047.3\u22127312\nwhich is likely associated with AX J0047.3\u22127312 (see also\nYokogawa et al. 2003). In Fig. 3 we present FFT power spectra\nand light curves folded at the pulse period of the four pulsars.\nAs indicated by the presence of the first harmonic in the power\nspectrum of RX J0049.7\u22127323, the pulse profile of this long\nperiod pulsar is double peaked. The determined pulse periods\nwith 1\u03c3 error are listed in Table 1.\nFrom SAX J0103.2\u22127209 (source 44, Israel et al. 2000)\nwhich is located at the rim of the field of SNR 0103\u221272.6,\nwe detect pulsations with a period of 341.2 s. This indicates that the period of large spin-up reported by (Israel et al.\n2000) is now lasting more than 4.5 years (Figs. 4 and 5).\nIn Fig. 5 we also plot period measurements of the two long\nperiod pulsars RX J0050.8\u22127316 and RX J0049.7\u22127323. The\ntwo pulsars with periods measured at more than two epochs,\nSAX J0103.2\u22127209 and RX J0050.8\u22127316=AX J0051\u2212733,\nshow very similar pulse periods and also (linear) period\nchanges \u1e56 of \u22121.6 s yr\u22121 and \u22121.0 s yr\u22121 , respectively. A \u1e56 of -14 s yr\u22121 is derived for the 750 s pulsar\nXMMU 004942.3\u2212732313 but is based on only two period\nmeasurements, one of them with large error.\nFor six of the eleven sources we do not detect significant\npulsations. From a Z21 analysis no period with more than 2.5 \u03c3\nsignificance was found. In particular in the data of observation\n0110000101 with low background, modulations with a similar pulsed fraction as seen from the detected pulsars (Fig. 3)\nshould be easily picked up. On the other hand, the sensitivity\nfor period detection is lower in the high background observation 0110000301. The pulse period of SAX J0103.2\u22127209 was\ndetected with a formal 3.2 \u03c3 significance (for an unknown period) and a slightly weaker modulation would not be detected\nfor sources 43 and 48.\n\n2.3. X-ray spectra\nEPIC-pn and -MOS spectra were extracted for the eleven Be/Xray binaries and candidates and simultaneously fit. An absorbed power-law model describes the data sufficiently well\n\n\f4\n\nHaberl & Pietsch: X-ray observations of Be/X-ray binaries in the SMC\n\nFig. 3.

Table 2 summarizes the spectral fit results for all eleven sources. The powerlaw photon indices \u03b3 show a narrow distribution with an average value of 1.0 and a standard deviation of 0.16. The total absorption column densities are above the Galactic fore-\n\nground value of 5.74\u00d71020 cm\u22122 as observed towards the\nSMC (Dickey & Lockman 1990) and indicates absorption by\ninterstellar matter in the SMC and/or local matter around the\nX-ray sources. For the absorbing material solar element abundances were used in the spectral fits. If an SMC abundance of\n0.2 solar is assumed (Russell & Dopita 1992), the contribution\nto the column density by SMC matter (total NH reduced by the\nGalactic foreground) needs to be multiplied by a factor of 5.0.\nIn Table 2 we list observed fluxes and source intrinsic luminosities in the 0.2-10.0 keV energy band.\n\n\f6\n\nHaberl & Pietsch: X-ray observations of Be/X-ray binaries in the SMC\n\nFig. 5.

Long term variability\nTo investigate intensity variations on time scales of years we\nlist in Table 2 the range of X-ray luminosities in which the\ninvestigated sources were detected in the past. We do this separately for instruments covering an energy band similar to the\nEPIC band (ASCA, BeppoSAX) and for ROSAT with the soft\nband of 0.1-2.4 keV. Most broad band luminosities were reported from ASCA observations by Yokogawa et al. (2003,\n0.7-10.0 keV) which were corrected by a factor of 1.05 to account for the slightly larger (0.2-10.0 keV) energy band. Only\nsource 44 (SAX J0103.2\u22127209) was observed with maximum\nluminosity by BeppoSAX (Israel et al. 2000). In this case the\ncorrection factor is 1.23. The correction factors were derived\nfor an unabsorbed power-law spectrum with photon index of\n1.0. Source 5 was not detected by ASCA and for sources 7 and\n9 the association with the nearby ASCA source 8 is unclear.\nWe also do not give an ASCA flux for source 48 because of\ncontamination of the spectrum by nearby sources due to the\nlarge ASCA point spread function. To obtain 0.2-10 keV luminosities based on ROSAT measurements we used the spectral\nparameters inferred from the EPIC spectra, computed expected\n\nFig. 6. EPIC spectra (crosses) of the pulsar RX J0049.77323=AX J0049.5-7323 together with the best-fit absorbed\npower-law model. The model is drawn in the upper panel as histograms for the pn spectrum (upper one) and both MOS spectra\n(lower pair which overlaps and appears as single histogram).\nPSPC count rates by folding the spectral model through the\nPSPC detector response and scaled the observed count rates to\nderive the conversion factor. Measured PSPC count rates were\ntaken from the Results Archive (RRA) PSPC source catalogue\nfrom pointed ROSAT observations (ROSAT Consortium 2000)\nwhich contains multiple detection entries for a source if observed more than once during the ROSAT mission. The last\ncolumn in Table 2 shows the ratio between maximum and min-\n\n\fimum luminosity which is at most a factor of 13. The intensity\nvariations are relatively moderate for this kind of objects and\ncan probably be explained by variations of the mass accretion\nrate along a neutron star orbit with moderate eccentricity within\nthe circum-stellar matter of the Be star. While variations up to a\nfactor of \u223c20 are observed from many Be/X-ray binaries (e.g.\nHaberl & Pietsch 1999), 'giant' outbursts (factor 100-1000) are\nrare and are thought to be explained by increased mass outflow\nthrough the Be stellar wind disc (Apparao 1994). No giant outbursts were so far detected from any of the eleven systems.\n\n7\n\nFrequency\n\nHaberl & Pietsch: X-ray observations of Be/X-ray binaries in the SMC\n\n3. The HMXB population of the SMC\n\n4. Summary\nWe performed temporal and spectral analyses of eleven\nBe/X-ray binaries and candidates observed serendipitously by\n\nPhoton index\n\nFrequency\n\nThe detection of a periodic 263.6 s X-ray flux modulation from\nXMMU J004723.7\u2212731226 increases the number of likely\nHMXB pulsars in the SMC to at least thirty-seven. In Table 3\nwe give an updated list of HMXBs and candidates in the SMC\nwhich is based on the work of HS00 and add transient pulsars detected by RXTE. We do not include two additional\nknown pulsars which may be of different type: AX J0043\u2212737\nfor which confirmation of a 87 ms period is needed and\nwhich could be a Crab-like pulsar (Yokogawa & Koyama 2000;\nYokogawa et al. 2003), and CXOU J0110043.1\u2212721134 a possible anomalous X-ray pulsar in the SMC (Lamb et al. 2002a).\nThe number of Be/X-ray binaries and candidates is the\nhighest known from any galaxy, including the Milky Way\nwhere about forty such systems (Liu et al. 2000) are known\ntoday. The SMC Be/X-ray binaries, all at a similar distance,\nconstitute an ideal sample for statistical studies. Luminosity\ndistributions were derived by HS00 and Sasaki et al. (2003).\nCompared to the Milky Way the SMC harbours a higher fraction of low-luminosity systems (\u223c1035 erg s\u22121 ), which may be\na selection effect due to a more difficult identification of such\nobjects in the Galactic Plane (HS00). The XMM-Newton results from SMC HMXBs allow to compare the X-ray spectra\nfrom already 16 sources [11 from this work and sources 33, 34,\n35, 41 and 45 from Sasaki et al. (2003)] obtained with the same\ninstruments and processed in a coherent way. In Fig. 7 (upper\npanel) the distribution of the power-law photon index is presented. The distribution is strongly peaked at 1.0, but includes\na weak wide contribution with indices between 0.65 and 1.45.\nAlthough the column densities derived from the spectra\nhave relatively large errors, the NH distribution (Fig. 7 bottom\npanel) exhibits two maxima. An excess of objects with little or\nno absorption may either indicate spectra with a soft component which is not recognized because of insufficient statistics\nor a special spatial distribution of the sources on the near side\nof the SMC (star formation arm). The second peak may be explained by interstellar absorption in the SMC with the majority\nof objects located in the inner parts of the SMC. A comparison\nwith similar data obtained from background AGN behind the\nSMC should allow to derive constraints on the total absorbing\ncolumn density through the SMC on a statistical basis.\n\nColumn density (1021 cm\u22122 )\n\nFig. 7. Distribution of power-law photon indices (top) and absorption column density (bottom, without Galactic absorption)\nmeasured from EPIC spectra of sixteen Be/X-ray binaries and\ncandidates in the SMC observed by the EPIC instruments of\nXMM-Newton.\n\nthe EPIC instruments on board XMM-Newton in two observations of the supernova remnants SNR 0047\u221273.5 and\nSNR 0103\u221272.6. From five of the objects pulsations in their\nX-ray flux are detected, four of them were previously known\npulsars and in one case, XMMU J004723.7\u2212731227, the\nXMM-Newton data revealed 263 s pulsations for the first\ntime. XMMU J004723.7\u2212731227 coincides in position with\nRX J0047.3\u22127312 which was suggested to be a Be/X-ray binary due to its likely identification with an H\u03b1 emission line\nobject (HS00). The detection of the pulse period strongly supports this identification.\nThe detection of pulsations, together with the good Xray positions allowed to securely identify sources detected\nby various X-ray space missions, like e.g. the 172 s pulsar\nAX J0051.6\u22127311 with XMMU J005152.2\u2212731033 (via pulsations) and RX J0051.9\u22127311 (via accurate position).
