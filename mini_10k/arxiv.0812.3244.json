Box 49, H-1525 Budapest, Hungary\nWe study a spatial two-strategy (cooperation and defection) Prisoner's Dilemma game with two types (A\nand B) of players located on the sites of a square lattice. The evolution of strategy distribution is governed\nby iterated strategy adoption from a randomly selected neighbor with a probability depending on the payoff\ndifference and also on the type of the neighbor. The strategy adoption probability is reduced by a pre-factor\n(w < 1) from the players of type B. We consider the competition between two opposite effects when increasing\nthe number of neighbors (k = 4, 8, and 24). Within a range of the portion of influential players (type A)\nthe inhomogeneous activity in strategy transfer yields a relevant increase (dependent on w) in the density of\ncooperators. The noise-dependence of this phenomenon is also discussed by evaluating phase diagrams.\nPACS numbers: 89.65.-s, 89.75.Fb, 87.23.Cc, 05.50.+q\n\nThe investigation of the spatial evolutionary Prisoner's\nDilemma (PD) games expands progressively since Nowak and\nMay [1] reported the maintenance of cooperative behavior\namong selfish players. In these models the PD game [2] represents a pair interaction between two players who can either cooperate (C) or defect (D) and their income depends\non both choices in a way forcing both rational (selfish) players to choose D while they would share equally the maximum\ntotal payoff for mutual cooperation.\nIn the first model the players are located on a square lattice, they can follow one of the two pure strategies (D and C)\nand their income comes from PD games with the neighbors.\nDuring a synchronized strategy update the players adopt the\nstrategy from the neighbor receiving the highest score. After\nthis pioneering work many modified versions of the original\nmodel have been suggested and studied (for recent surveys see\n[3, 4]). Let us mention only a couple of examples: in some\nmodels larger set of strategies was used [5, 6, 7], in the evolutionary rules noises [8, 9, 10] were introduced that can help\nthe cooperative behavior [11, 12, 13], and the spatial structure\nwas also extended by locating the players on different graphs\ngiving a better description about the connections in human societies [14, 15, 16, 17]. In the last years the concept of interaction and learning graphs are distinguished [18, 19, 20] and the\nresearch of the co-evolution of strategy distribution and these\ngraph has also become a promising topic [21, 22, 23]. It is\nfound, furthermore, that different types of personality [24, 25]\nand inhomogeneous activity in the strategy adoption can also\nsupport cooperation [15, 26, 27, 28] particularly if some distinguished players have higher influence to spread their strategies [29, 30].\nIn the latter case the relevant increase in the frequency of\ncooperators is related to a phenomenon described previously\nby Santos et al. [31, 32] who studied evolutionary PD games\non scale-free networks with an evolutionary rule exploiting\nthe high income for players (called hubs) who have a large\nnumber of neighbors. As a result, on the scale-free networks\nthe strategy of hubs become an example to be followed by\ntheir neighborhood. Thus, the hubs as influential players face\nthe consequence of the imitation of their own strategy that\nincreases (decreases) the income of cooperative (defective)\n\nhubs. After a short transient process this phenomenon favors\nthe spreading of cooperation because the influential players\ncan also adopt strategy from each other for suitable connectivity structures. Evidently, in the absence of links between influential players the mentioned mechanism cannot help cooperators to beat defectors [31, 32, 33]. Recent studies [30, 34]\nhave indicated that the presence of linked influential players\non scale-free graphs can efficiently promote cooperation (even\nfor normalized payoffs) if the capability of strategy spreading\ndiffers from player to player. These results raise many interesting questions about the impact of the size of neighborhood\non the frequency of cooperators for inhomogeneous activity\nin the strategy transfer.\nIn the present work we study the competition between two\nopposite effects emerging if the average number of neighbors\nis increased. On one hand, the above described mechanism\n(supporting the spreading of cooperation for inhomogeneous\nstrategy transfer capability) is enhanced when choosing larger\nand larger k. On the other hand, the increase of the number of\nneighbors, k, is beneficial for defectors on regular networks\n[32, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40]. Here it is worth mentioning that\nthe mean-field approximation (predicting the extinction of cooperators in the evolutionary PD games [3, 4]) gives a simple\nexplanation of this phenomenon. The scope of the present paper is to explore the impact of these two opposite effects by\ncomparing results obtained for three different sizes of neighborhood. More precisely, the studied types of neighborhood\nare the von Neumann neighborhood including only the nearest\nneighbors (k = 4), the Moore neighborhood with nearest and\nnext-nearest neighbors (k = 8), and the case of k = 24 where\nplayers within a 5 \u00d7 5 box of sites are neighbors of the central\nplayer (self-interaction is excluded). Monte Carlo (MC) simulations are used to study systematically the effects of payoff,\nnumber of neighbors, and inhomogeneous capability of strategy transfer (for a fixed noise level) on the average number of\ncooperators.\nFor these evolutionary PD game models two types of players (nx = A or B) are located on the sites x of a square lattice\nwith a concentration of \u03bd and (1 \u2212 \u03bd) and their random initial\ndistribution remains unchanged (quenched) during the simulations. The income of player x comes from one-shot PD games\n\n\f2\nwith her neighbors, that is,\nsx * Asy\n\n(1)\n\ny\u2208\u03a9x\n\nwhere the sum runs over all neighboring sites (\u03a9x ) of player\nx, the payoff matrix is defined as suggested by Nowak and\nMay [1],\n\u0013\n\u0012\n0 b\n, 1<b<2,\n(2)\nA=\n0 1\nand the defective and cooperative strategies are denoted by\nunit vectors as\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\n0\n1\n.\n(3)\nor C =\nsx = D =\n1\n0\nThe evolution of strategy distribution is governed by random\nsequential strategy update representing strategy adoption from\na randomly chosen site y to one of its neighbors x with a probability\nW (sx \u2190 sy ) = wy\n\n1\n1 + exp[(Px \u2212 Py )/kK]\n\nof \u03c1 decreases monotonously from 1 to 0 if b is increased\n(k)\n(k)\nwithin a region of b (bc1 (K) < b < bc2 (K)) where the\nstrategies C and D coexist. For all the three types of neigh(k)\n(k)\nborhoods bc1 (K) (bc2 (K)) tends to 1 from below (above) if\nK \u2192 \u221e. In other words, in the strong noise limit (K \u2192 \u221e)\nthe systems reproduce the behavior of the mean-field model,\nthat is \u03c1 drops suddenly from 1 to 0 at b = 1. In the oppo(k)\n(k)\nsite case (K \u2192 0) the limit values of bc1 and bc2 depend\non k. When decreasing K the upper critical value of b tends\n(k)\nmonotonously to a value (bc1 (0) larger than 1 if k = 8 or 24.\n(4)\nOn the contrary, for k = 4, the function bc2 (K) has a local\n(4)\nmaximum at K = Kopt \u2243 0.08 (bc2 (K = Kopt ) \u2243 1.08)\nand approaches 1 if K \u2192 0.\nIn the light of the above results we first study the density\nof cooperators (\u03c1) when varying the portion of players of type\nA for fixed values of payoff (b), strategy transfer capability\n(w), and noise (K). The latter was chosen to present optimal\ncooperation for k = 4 system (i.e., K \u223c\n= Kopt ). The MC data\nare compared in Fig. 1 for the three types of neighborhood.\nFor the sake of comparison, we selected such a high value of b,\n\n(4)\n\ndependent on the difference of normalized payoffs (e.g. (Px \u2212\nPy )/k) for later convenience of comparisons. For this strategy adoption probability the meaning of the parameter K is\nanalogous to the temperature as introduced in the kinetic Ising\nmodel and characterizes the magnitude of payoff noise affecting the decision of player x [9, 10]. The multiplicative factor\nwy denotes the strategy transfer capability of player y,\n\u001a\n1, if ny = A\nwy =\n, 0<w<1.\n(5)\nw, if ny = B\nIn this notation players of type A represent those individuals\nwho can easily convince their neighbors to adopt the strategy\nthey are just following. This personal feature can be related to\nage, reputation, etc.\nFor all the three cases studied here the simulations are performed on an L \u00d7 L square of sites with periodic boundary\nconditions. The evolution of the spatial distribution of the C\nand D strategies starts from an uncorrelated initial state where\ncooperators and defectors are present with the same probability. When repeating the above described elementary steps the\nsystem develops into a final stationary state characterized by\nthe average density of cooperators (\u03c1). After a suitable relaxation time tr \u03c1 is determined by averaging the density of\ncooperators over a time ta . Typical (maximum) value of parameters used in our simulations are the following: L = 400\n(1600); tr \u2243 ta = 104 (106 ) MCS [during one MC step\n(MCS) each player has a chance once on average to adopt one\nof the neighboring strategies]. Pronounced long relaxations\nwere observed at the large noise limit.\nBefore discussing the behaviors of the above systems we\nbriefly recall some general features of the homogeneous system (\u03bd = 0 or 1) [41]. The average (total) payoff increases\nmonotonously with \u03c1 independent of the initial strategy distribution. Furthermore, in each homogeneous system the value\n\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n\u03c1\n\nPx =\n\nX\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n\u03bd\nFIG. 1: Density of cooperators as a function of the portion of A\nplayers if b = 1.05, K = 0.1 and w = 0.1 for three different\nneighborhoods: k = 4 (open squares); 8 (closed squares); and 24\n(closed triangles).\n\nwhich prevents cooperation in the homogeneous model of k =\n24. Figure 1 shows that the highest density of cooperators can\nbe observed (at \u03bd = 0 or 1) for k = 8 where the overlapping\ntriangles in the connectivity structure support the spreading\n(maintenance) of cooperation as discussed in [12]. The further\n(k)\nincrease of k, however, yields a decrease in both \u03c1 and bc2\n[32] tending to the behavior of mean-field model. This is the\nreason why cooperators become extinct in the final stationary\nstate for the homogeneous system at k = 24.\nFigure 1 demonstrates clearly the existence of an optimum\ncomposition (defined by the maximum in \u03c1) of the players\nA and B. The presence of distinguished players results in a\nrelatively higher impact on cooperation level for larger k. In\nagreement with the expectations, the more neighbors the players have, the smaller portion of influential players (type A)\n\n\f3\n\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n\u03c1\n\nare capable to achieve the highest increase in \u03c1. The resultant\nasymmetry can be observed in the function \u03c1(\u03bd) for k = 24.\nFor the largest neighborhood our simulations have clearly indicated that cooperators can remain alive only within a region\nof \u03bd with boundaries dependent on w and K. It is expected,\nthat this region, \u03bd1 (w, K) < \u03bd < \u03bd2 (w, K), shrinks if we\nincrease k further.\nAs the largest effect is found for the largest neighborhood,\nhenceforth our attention will be focused on the system of\nk = 24. Figure 2 illustrates the increase of the density of\ncooperators when varying the composition of players A and\nB for several values of w at a fixed payoff and noise level.\nWhen the difference is small, typically when 1/w \u2264 2, the\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n1\n\n1.1\n\n1.2\n\n1.3\n\n1.4\n\nb\n\n1\n\nFIG. 3: Density of cooperators as a function of b for different values\nof 1/w (w = 1, 0.2, 0.05, 0.02m and 0.005 from left to right) at fixed\nnoise level (K = 0.1), composition (\u03bd = 0.2), and neighborhood\n(k = 24).\n\n0.8\n\n\u03c1\n\n0.6\n0.4\n\nneighborhoods (k = 4 and 24) at a fixed portion of players A\nand B.

If the ratio 1/w is increased then the cooperators can\nsurvive within the above mentioned region of \u03bd. This interval becomes wider and wider while the maximum value of\n\u03c1 increases monotonously until reaching its saturation value\n(\u03c1 = 1). Consequently, we can observe four subsequent transitions in Fig. 2 if \u03bd increased for sufficiently high values of\nthe ratio 1/w. Apparently the density of cooperators tends\nto a limit profile if 1/w \u2192 \u221e. We have to emphasize that\nthe rigorous analysis of the asymptotic behavior becomes difficult because the transient time increases with the ratio 1/w\nparticularly at small values of \u03bd.\nWe have also studied the effect of the variation of w on the\ncooperation level at different payoffs (b). To avoid additional\neffects the noise level is fixed at a composition (\u03bd = 0.2) close\nto its optimum value. The results, summarized in Fig. 3, illustrates that the curves \u03c1(b) shift to larger b values if the ratio\n1/w is increased. (For comparison, the left curve shows the\nresults obtained in the homogeneous system). The plotted results refer to a shift proportional to ln(1/w). Due to the above\nmentioned increasing run time if we choose larger values of\n1/w, the more rigorous (numerical) confirmation of this trend\ngoes beyond the scope of the present work. Instead of it we\nhave concentrated on the effect of noise for the two extreme\n\nbc\n\n1.2\nFIG. 2: Density of cooperators vs. \u03bd for five different values of the\nreduced strategy transfer capability (w = 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, and\n0.2 from top to bottom) at b = 1.05, k = 24, and K = 0.1.\n\n1.1\n1.0\n0.9\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nK\nFIG. 4: The upper and lower critical values of b for k = 24 and\n\u03bd = 0.2 (open squares connected with dashed lines).

Between the upper and lower critical points strategies C and D coexist.\nAbove (below) this region only defectors (cooperators) remain\nalive in the final stationary states. For both cases the system\nbehavior is not affected by the spatial inhomogeneities in the\nlow noise limit, in agreement with the previous results [29].\nIn other words, the relevant improvement in the maintenance\nof cooperation appears in the noisy systems even for the limit\nK \u2192 \u221e. In contrary to the prediction of mean-field theory\n\n\f4\nthe present data indicate clearly that cooperators and defectors\ncan coexist within a region of b if K goes to infinity, that is,\nbc1 and bc2 tends to two distinct limit values for both types of\nneighborhood. This latter feature has already been confirmed\nqualitatively by the pair approximation for k = 4 [29]. Notice, furthermore, that the larger neighborhood yields a larger\nincrease in the value of bc1 and bc2 when applying optimum\ncomposition of players A and B for both systems.\nIn summary, within the framework of evolutionary PD\ngames, the present investigation of the effect of the inhomogeneous strategy transfer capability on the cooperative behavior\nhas indicated a relevant increase in the density of cooperators\nif the fraction of influential players was close to the optimum\nvalue dependent on the number of neighbors (range of interaction) if two types of strategy transfer capability (represented\nby the players A and B) are distinguished. It is found that the\nlarger neighborhood with a less fraction of influential players\n(type A) can be more beneficial for the whole system due to\nthe imitation mechanism rewarding (punishing) cooperation\n(defection) for the influential players. The improvement of\ncooperation increases with the ratio of strategy transfer capa-\n\nbility (1/w) between players of type A and B. Furthermore,\nthe maintenance of cooperation is supported remarkably by\nthe mentioned effect in the high noise limit where the region\nof coexistence is broadened and shifted to higher values of b.\nFor small fraction of players A one can think that the competition between the influential players surrounded by their\nfollowers can be characterized by an effective (rescaled) payoff matrix favoring cooperation (as it appears on evolving networks [21]) while their competitions are disturbed by those\nplayers of type B who do not belong to the neighborhood of\nany influential player. These latter B players can mediate an\ninteraction between the influential players and/or preserve the\ndefective behavior. Further research is requested to clarify the\nrelevance of these opposite effects.\n\n[1] M. A. Nowak and R. M. May, Int. J. Bifurcat. Chaos 3, 35\n(1993).\n[2] H.
