Introduction\n\n1\n\n2. The Riemann Zeta Zeros\n\n3\n\n3. The fractal dimension of the Riemann zeros\n\n3\n\n4. Conclusion\n\n5\n\n1. Introduction\nThe Riemann hypothesis(RH)[1] is that all the nontrivial zeros of the zeta function\nhave real part 1/2, so that the quantities tj defined by\n1\n\u03b6( + itj ) = 0\n2\n\n(1.1)\n\nare all real. There are strong evidence to support this hypothesis: the first billions\nof zeros are on the line, and also more than 40% of the nontrivial zeros satisfy the\nRiemann hypothesis. There are also mathematical evidence, such as the Deligne's\nproof of the corresponding Riemann hypothesis for Zeta function of arbitrary varieties\nover finite fields, or the Weil's explicit formula. For a review, see the paper written\nfor the Millennium by E.Bombieri[2], or the paper[3] by J.B.Conrey.\nPolya and Hilbert made the conjecture that the imaginary part of the Riemann\nzeros could be the eigenvalues of a Hermitian operator. Then the RH would follow, since Hermitian operator have real eigenvalues. In the 50's Selberg found a\nremarkable duality between the length of the geodesics on a Riemann surface and\nthe eigenvalues of the Laplacian operator defined on it[4]. Quite independently of Selberg's work, Montgomery showed that the Riemann zeros are distributed randomly\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\fand obeying locally the statistical law of the Random Matrix Theory(RMT)[5]. The\nmatrix related to the Riemann zeros is the gaussian unitary ensemble(GUE) associated to the random hermitian matrices. Montgomery's results found an impressive\nnumerical confirmation in the work of Odlyzko in the 80's, so the GUE law is nowadays called the Mongomery-Odlyzko law[6].\n\nA further step along this physical approach to RH was taken by Berry, who\nnoticed a similarity between the formula yielding the fluctuations of the number of\nthe zeros around its average position, and a formula giving the fluctuations of the\nenergy levels of a Hamiltonian obtained by the quantization of a classical chaotic\nsystem[?]. The quantum chaos approach can explain the deviations from the GUE\nlaw found numerically by Odlyzko. By this model suffer an overall sign problem\nand this problem lead Connes to propose an abstract approach to the RH based\non discrete mathematical objects known as adeles[7]. Those approaches give two\npossible physical realizations of the Riemann zeros, either as point like spectra or\nas missing spectra in a continuum. The next step came in 1999 when Berry and\nKeating[8] on one hand and Connes[7] on the other, proposed that the classical\nHamiltonian H = xp, where x and p are the position and momenta of a 1D particle,\nis closely related to the Riemann zeros. They choose different regularizations of\nthis Hamiltonion and gave different realization of the Riemann zeros. And all these\nsemiclassical results are heuristic and lack so far of a consistent quantum version.\nAnd there are further work along this line[9].\n\nIn this paper, we will go along with other approach, that is to consider the zeros\nas the eigenvalues of the Dirac operator on a suitable manifold. With the heat kernel\nexpansion we can get the dimension of this manifold and find that the manifold is\nfractal and has fractal dimension about 1.1 \u2212 1.2, closed to the 1 dimension. And\nour result don't dependent on the models.\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\f2. The Riemann Zeta Zeros\nThe Riemann Zeta function is defined in the half-plane Re(s) > 1 by\n\u03b6(s) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n1\n=\ns\nn\nn=1\n\nY\np(prime)\n\n1\n.\n1 \u2212 p\u2212s\n\n(2.1)\n\nand has a meromorphic continuation to C. This function satisfy the functional\nequation\n\u03be(s) := \u03c0 \u2212s/2 \u0393(s/2)\u03b6(s) = \u03be(1 \u2212 s).\n\n(2.2)\n\nIt is known that the complex zeros of \u03b6(s) lie in the \"critical strip\" 0 < Re(s) < 1,\nand Riemann hypothesis states that in fact all these zeros lie on the \"critical line\"\nRe(s) = 1/2, that is the tj on 1.1 are all real. The asymptotic density of the zeros is\ngiven by\nd(t) =\n\n1\nt\n1\nlog( ) + O( 2 )\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\nt\n\n(2.3)\n\nand therefore that the mean spacing between the zeros decreases logarithmically with\nincreasing t. Define the scaled Riemann zeros so as to have unit mean spacing, that\nis\nuj =\n\ntj\ntj\nlog .\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n\n(2.4)\n\nWe will consider those numbers as the eigenvalues of the Dirac operator on some\nconjectured manifold, and compare to the results from the random matrix theory\nand quantum chaos theory.\n\n3. The fractal dimension of the Riemann zeros\nThe reason why we consider the zeros as the eigenvalues of the Dirac operator is\nthat, from the functional equation 2.2 we know that if 1/2 + itj is the zero of the\nRiemann zeta function, 1/2 \u2212 itj is also the zero of the function, so \u00b1tj both are\neigenvalues, thus we choose the Dirac operator instead of the Laplacian operator.\nWe assume that this Dirac operator has the similar heat kernel expansion as the\nusual one, and this assumption can be verified by our results. From the heat kernel\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n\fexpansion we can define the fractal dimension as follows[5]:\nd ln(T race(e\u2212D\nDs = \u2212\nd ln \u039b\n\n2 /\u039b2\n\n))\n\n.\n\n(3.1)\n\nSubstitute the scaled Riemann zeros uj [10] into 3.1, and plot the figure of the fractal\ndimension varying with the \u039b. From the above figure we can see that although the\n\n2.0\n\nD\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\nN=160\nN=80\n\n0.5\n\nN=40\nN=20\n\n0.0\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n\u039b\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nFigure 1: The fractal dimension of the Riemann zeta zeros for different numbers\n\nfractal dimension general vary with the \u039b, at the middle region, the curve is nearly\nflat, and correspondent to\nDs = 1.1 \u2212 1.2\n\n(3.2)\n\nIn the previous paper[11], we show that for ordinary sphere, this region give the\ncorrect dimension, so here we also consider this number is the dimension of the\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n\funderling manifold. We also notice that for more zeros, the nearly flat region will be\nlonger.\nThe GUE conjecture state that all statistics for zeta zeros and eigenvalues of\nHermitian matrices match. And the numerical calculation performed by Odlyzko\nconfirmed this conjecture. But it can't tell us exactly which Hermitian matrix gives\nthe zeta zeros. On the other hand, the quantum chaos theory give some clues for\nthe dynamics behind the zeta function, that is chaotic, time-asymmetry system. But\nthe system is 1 dimension, and can't give the above figure. So we think that this\napproach is unsatisfying.\n\n4. Conclusion\nWe get the fractal dimension from the scaled zeros of the Riemann zeta function, so\nit must be obeyed by any system which is used to model the Riemann zeta function.\nUnfortunately, the current physical models, such as the GUE matrices, quantum\nchaos system don't satisfy this picture.\nThe fractal dimension is about Ds = 1.1 \u2212 1.2, not away from the integer 1, but\nshow the fractal character of the Riemann zeta function. The similarity between the\nRiemann hypothesis and the quantum gravity has been point out by Connes and\nMarcolli in their book[12], and our result confirm this relations.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was partly done at Beijing Normal University.
