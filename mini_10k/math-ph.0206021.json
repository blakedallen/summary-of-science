other and that are both, whenever technically\nfeasible, guided and ultimately confronted by experiment: There is the quest\nto find the underlying theories that govern natural phenomena, and then\nthere is the equally complex and important task to use these fundamental\nbuilding blocks to understand actual physical systems and to solve given\nproblems. Here we will be mainly concerned with the latter.\nThis thesis contains a selection of works in theoretical/mathematical\nphysics that are all in one way or the other concerned with exact results\nfor quantum systems. The problems are taken from various fields of physics,\nranging from concrete quantum systems, in particular spin and strongly correlated electron systems, over abstract quantum integrable systems to gauge\ntheories on quantum spaces.\nSince we are interested in mathematically rigorous results one would a\npriori expect the need to invent a novel approach for each given problem.\nHowever, it turns out that one can often use similar ideas in many different\nfields of physics \u2013 the methods are transferable. There are several recurring themes in this thesis, the most obvious being the use of symmetries.\nThen there is the trick to simplify a system by enlarging it. In the work\non frustrated spin systems and on quantum integrable systems we construct\ndoubles; in the first case by adjoining a suitable mirror image, yielding a\nre positive whole, in the second case by adjoining the dual of configuration space and thereby linearizing the equations of motion. In the work on\nnonabelian noncommutative gauge theories we enlarge space-time by extra\ninternal dimensions to reduce the problem to the abelian case.\nThe last chapter on noncommutative gauge theories and star products\nis the focus of my current research. At first sight this topic does not seem\nto fit in the central theme of this thesis since it frequently employs formal\npower series, i.e., something inherently perturbative, or in other words, not\n\"exact\" However, the framework of deformation quantization allows us to\nseparate algebraic questions from difficult problems regarding representation\nv\n\n\fvi\n\nPREFACE\n\ntheory and convergence, thereby enabling, e.g., a rigorous proof by explicit\nconstruction of the existence of a Seiberg-Witten map.\nThis thesis is based on a series of publications [1]\u2013[7]. The original presentation has been streamlined and illustrations have been added. New unpublished results are scattered throughout the text. Each chapter starts\nwith an introductory overview including an indication of the original sources\nand, where appropriate, a discussion of cross relations between the chapters.\nThese introductory sections starting on pages 1, 21, 37, 49, 83 and the historical remarks on the Lieb-Mattis theorem starting on page 12 can be also\nread independently of the main text as a brief summary.\n\nAcknowledgments\nI am indebted to Julius Wess and Elliott Lieb for letting me join their respective groups in Munich and Princeton where most of the research of this\nthesis was done.\nI thank Branislav Jur\u010do, Elliott Lieb and Julius Wess for fruitful and enjoyable collaboration on parts of the material included in this thesis as well as\nBianca Cerchiai, John Madore, Lutz M\u00f6ller, Stefan Schraml and Wolfgang\nSpitzer for joint work on closely related topics [8]\u2013[12].\nMany helpful and inspiring discussions with Michael Aizenman, Paolo Aschieri, Almut Burchard, Rainer Dick, Gaetano Fiore, Dirk Hundertmark,\nMichael Loss, Roderich Moessner, Nicolai Reshetikhin, Michael Schlieker,\nAndrzej Sitarz, Harold Steinacker, Stefan Theisen, Lawrence Thomas and\nBruno Zumino have also contributed much to this work.\n\n\fChapter 1\nFrustrated quantum spin systems\nGeometric frustration occurs in spin systems with interactions that favor\nanti-alignment and involve fully connected units of three or more spins, that\ncan obviously not all be mutually anti-aligned (Fig. 1.1). The kagome lat-\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\nFigure 1.1: Triangular and tetrahedral frustrated units.\ntice is an example of a frustrated spin system with site-sharing triangular\nunits, the pyrochlore lattice and its two-dimensional version, the pyrochlore\ncheckerboard are examples with site-sharing tetrahedra (Fig. 1.2). Common\nto all these systems is the richness of classical ground states which make them\nvery interesting but unfortunately also very hard to understand, especially\nin the quantum case. We were able to obtain some exact results (among\nthe first in this field) for the fully frustrated quantum antiferromagnet on a\npyrochlore checkerboard: With the help of the reflection symmetry of this\ntwo-dimensional lattice we have established rigorously that there is always a\nground state with total spin zero (i.e., a singlet), furthermore, in the periodic\ncase all ground states (if there is more than one) are singlets and the spinexpectation vanishes for each frustrated unit (this is the quantum analog of\nthe \"ice rule\" for the corresponding Ising system). With the same methods\nwe also found explicit upper bounds on the susceptibility, \u03c7(T ) \u2264 81 (in natural units), both for the ground state and at finite temperature. This bound\nbecomes exact in the classical high spin limit. The pyrochlore checkerboard\n1\n\n\f2\n\nCHAPTER 1. FRUSTRATED QUANTUM SPIN SYSTEMS\n\nFigure 1.2: Pyrochlore lattice over checkerboard lattice.\nis a system in which frustration effects are especially strong, so it is very\nexciting that a door to a more rigorous understanding of such systems has\nbeen opened.\nOur approach combines old ideas of reflection positivity with more recent methods of Lieb and myself that we had originally tried to use with\nthe Hubbard model (see chapter 3). Figure 1.3 illustrates the basic idea for\nthe simpler case of a classical antiferromagnetic spin system: The lattice on\nthe top shows a given state of the spin system, the two lattices on the bottom show derived states. They are constructed from the original state by\nreflecting the left (resp. right) half over to the right (resp. left) half while\nsimultaneously flipping all the spins. This leads in either case to a state with\na lower energy. (Recall that we are considering anti -ferromagnetic interaction.) If the original state was a ground state then the derived states must\nalso be ground states of the system. In the quantum case things get more\ninvolved since states are in general superpositions of configurations like the\nones in Figure 1.3. Mathematically the extra complexity can be handled by\ntrace inequalities. Both in the classical and quantum case we gain a lot of\n\n\f1.1.

The method and some of\nthe results generalize to other reflection symmetric lattices and hold in arbitrary dimensions. In section 1.2 we shall in particular establish the following\nexact properties of reflection symmetric spin systems with antiferromagnetic\ncrossing bonds: At least one ground state has total spin zero and a positive\nsemidefinite coefficient matrix and the crossing bonds obey an ice rule. This\naugments some previous results which were limited to bipartite spin systems\nand is of particular interest for frustrated spin systems.\nThere are many open questions and there is hope that much remains\nto be learned with the new approach which, by the way, has its origin in\nold work by Osterwalder on quantum field theory. This work was done in\ncollaboration with E. Lieb at Princeton University and is published in [1, 2].\n(The following two sections are based on these publications.)\n\n1.1\n1.1.1\n\nThe Pyrochlore checkerboard\nGeometric frustration\n\nGeometrically frustrated spin systems are known to have many interesting\nproperties that are quite unlike those of conventional magnetic systems or\nspin glasses [12]. Most results are for classical systems. The first frustrated\nsystem, for which the richness of classical ground states was noted, was the\n\n\f4\n\nCHAPTER 1. FRUSTRATED QUANTUM SPIN SYSTEMS\n\ntriangular lattice [13]. Subsequently, the pyrochlore lattice, which consists\nof tetrahedra that share sites, was identified as a lattice on which the frustration effects are especially strong [14]. Unusual low-energy properties \u2013 in\nparticular the absence of ordering at any temperature, was predicted both\nfor discrete [14] and continuous [15] classical spin sytems. The ground state\nand low energy properties of the classical pyrochlore antiferromagnet \u2013 whose\nquantum version we are interested in \u2013 has been extensivly studied in [16].\nBoth the interest and difficulty in studying frustrated spin systems stem\nfrom the large ground-state degeneracy, which precludes most perturbative\napproaches.\nAs is the case for most other strong interacting systems in more than one\ndimension, very little is known exactly about the ground states of frustrated\nquantum spin systems. Most of the present knowledge has been obtained by\nnumerics or clever approximations. Quantum fluctuations have been studied\nin the limits of large-S [18], where a tendency towards lifting the groundstate degeneracy in favor of an ordered state (\"quantum order by disorder\")\nwas detected. In the opposite limit \u2013 S = 1/2, where quantum fluctuations\nare much stronger \u2013 the pyrochlore antiferromagnet has been identified as\na candidate for a quantum disordered magnet (\"quantum spin liquid\") [19],\nand it has also been discussed in terms of a resonating valence bond approach\n[20]. However, there are no exact results against which to test the reliability\nof the results in this limit. In contrast to this, for conventional \u2013 bipartite \u2013\nantiferromagnetic spin systems it is well known, for example, that the energy\nlevels are ordered in a natural way according to spin, starting from spin\nzero [21]. Geometrically frustrated systems are not bipartite and thus this\notherwise quite general theorem does not apply.\nIn the following we shall focus on the pyrochlore checkerboard: this is\na two dimensional array of site-sharing tetrahedra, whose projection onto a\nplane is a square lattice with two extra diagonal bonds on every other square,\nsee figures 1.2, 1.4(a). (The regular pyrochlore lattice is a three-dimensional\narray of site-sharing tetrahedra; it coincides with the checkerboard if suitable\nperiodic boundary conditions are imposed.) The tetrahedra \u2013 or squares with\nextra diagonal bonds \u2013 are the frustrated units and will henceforth be called\nboxes.\nThe hamiltonian of a quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a general\nlattice is (in natural units)\nX\nHAF =\nsi * sj ,\n(1.1)\nhi,ji\n\nwhere the sum is over bonds hi, ji that connect sites i and j and s = (s1 , s2 , s3 )\nare spin operators in the spin-s representation, where s can be anything.

It has a hamiltonian that\nis (up to a constant) the total spin squared of one box and the energy levels,\ndegeneracies, and eigenstates follow from the decomposition of the Hilbert\nspace of four spin-s particles into components of total spin; all ground states\nhave total spin zero and there are 2s + 1 of them.\n\n1.1.2\n\nReflection symmetry\n\nA checkerboard lattice of arbitrary size, with or without periodic boundary\nconditions but with an even number of independent sites, has the property\nthat it can be split into two equal parts that are mirror images of one another\nabout a line that cuts bonds, as indicated in figure 1.4, and that contains\nno sites. We shall now show that such a system has at least one spin-zero\nground state. It is actually not important, for the following argument, what\nthe lattice looks like on the left or right; these sublattices neither need to be\ncheckerboards nor do they have to be purely antiferromagnetic (as long as\ntotal spin is a good quantum number). What is impotant is, that the whole\nsystem is reflection symmetric about the line that separates left and right\nand that the crossing bonds are of checkerboard type. (For a system with\nperiodic boundary conditions in one direction there will actually be two such\nlines, but we emphasize that periodic boundary conditions are not needed\nhere even though it is needed in the usual reflection positivity applications;\nsee [22] and references therein.) A key observation is that these crossing\n\n\f6\n\nCHAPTER 1. FRUSTRATED QUANTUM SPIN SYSTEMS\n\nbonds (solid lines in figure 1.4(b)) form antiferromagnetic bonds SL * SR\nbetween pairs of spins SL = s1 + s2 and SR = s3 + s4 of each box on the\nsymmetry line.\nThe hamiltonian is H = HL + HR + HC , where HL and HR act solely in\nthe Hilbert spaces of the left, respectively right, subsystem\nand HC contains\nP\nthe crossing bonds. For the checkerboard HC = y ((s1 + s2 ) * (s3 + s4 ))y ,\nwith the sum over boxes y that are bisected by the symmetry line. HL and\nHR are completely arbitrary as long as they commute with the total spin\noperator. We will, however, assume here that they are real in the S 3 basis.\nAny state of the system can be written in terms of a matrix c as\nX\nc\u03b1\u03b2 \u03c8\u03b1L \u2297 (\u03c8\u03b2R )rot ,\n(1.3)\n\u03c8=\n\u03b1,\u03b2\n\nwhere the \u03c8\u03b1L form a real orthonormal basis of S 3 eigenstates for the left subsystem and the (\u03c8\u03b2R )rot are the corresponding states for the right subsystem,\nbut rotated by an angle \u03c0 around the 2-direction in spin space. This rotation\ntakes \u2191 into \u2193, \u2193 into \u2212 \u2191, and more generally |s, mi into (\u2212)s\u2212m |s, \u2212mi. It\nreverses the signs of the operators S 1 and S 3 , while it keeps S 2 unchanged.\nThe eigenvalue problem H\u03c8 = E\u03c8 is now a matrix equation\nT\n\nhL c + c(hR ) \u2212\n\n3 X\nX\ni=1\n\n(i) T\nt(i)\ny c(ty ) = Ec,\n\n(1.4)\n\ny\n\nwhere (hL )\u03b1\u03b2 and (hR )\u03b1\u03b2 are real, symmetric matrix elements of the cor(i)\nrosponding terms in the hamiltonian and the ty are the real matrices defined\n(1,3)\n(1,3)\n(1,3)\nfor the spin operators s1 and s2 in box y by t\u03b1\u03b2 = h\u03c8\u03b1L |s1 + s2 |\u03c8\u03b2L i and\n(2)\n\n(2)\n\n(2)\n\nt\u03b1\u03b2 = ih\u03c8\u03b1L |s1 + s2 |\u03c8\u03b2L i. Note the overall minus sign of the crossing term\nin (1.4): replacing s1 + s2 by s3 + s4 and \u03c8 L by (\u03c8 R )rot gives a change of sign\nfor directions 1 and 3, while the i in the definition of t(2) gives the minus sign\nfor direction 2.\nConsider now the energy expectation in terms of c:\nX\n(i) \u2020\nh\u03c8|H|\u03c8i = tr cc\u2020 hL + tr c\u2020 chR \u2212\ntr c\u2020 t(i)\n(1.5)\ny c(ty ) .\ni,y\n\nSince H is left-right symmetric and by assumption real, we find that for an\neigenstate of H with coefficient matrix c, there is also an eigenstate with\nmatrix c\u2020 and, by linearity, with c + c\u2020 and i(c \u2212 c\u2020 ). Without loss of generality we may, therefore, write eigenstates of H in terms of Hermitean c = c\u2020 .\nWe shall also take \u03c8 to be normalized: h\u03c8|\u03c8i = tr c\u2020 c = 1. Following [23],\n\n\f7\n\n1.1. THE PYROCHLORE CHECKERBOARD\n\nFigure 1.5: Canonical spin-zero state \u2013 the pyrochlore lattice is shown folded\nalong the symmetry axis, thick lines represent singlets.\n\nlet us write the trace in the last term of (1.5) in the diagonal basis of c:\nP\n(i)\n(i)\n(i)\n\u2212tr c\u2020 ty c(ty )\u2020 = \u2212 k,l ck cl |(ty )kl |2 . This expression clearly does not increase if we replace all the ck by their absolute values |ck\u221a\n|, i.e., if we replace\nthe matrix c by the positive semidefinite matrix |c| = c2 . The first two\nterms in (1.5) and the norm of \u03c8 remain unchanged under this operation.\nWe conclude that if c is a ground state than so is |c|. Since c = c+ \u2212 c\u2212 and\n|c| = c+ + c\u2212 , with positive semidefinite (p.s.d.) c+ and c\u2212 , we may, in fact,\nchose a basis of ground states with p.s.d. coefficient matrices.\n\n1.1.3\n\nSinglets and magnetization\n\nNext, we will show that the state \u03c80 with the unit matrix as coefficient\nmatrix (in the S 3 eigenbasis) has total spin zero. Since the overlap of \u03c80\nwith a state with matrix c is simply the trace of c, which is neccessarily\nnon-zero for states with a p.s.d. matrix, and because spin is a good quantum\nnumber of the problem, this will imply that there is a least one ground state\nwith total spin zero. First consider a spin-1/2 system. In the S 3 eigenbasis\nevery site has then either spin up or down. The state with unit coefficient\nmatrix is a tensor product of singlets on corresponding pairs of sites i \u2208 L,\ni\u2032 \u2208 R of the two sublattices (see Fig. 1.5):\nO\nO\n\u03c80 =\n(\u2191 (\u2191)rot + \u2193 (\u2193)rot )ii\u2032 =\n(\u2191\u2193 \u2212 \u2193\u2191)ii\u2032 .\n(1.6)\ni\u2208L\n\ni\u2208L\n\nThe analogous state for a system with arbitrary spins,\n\u03c80 =\n\ns\nO X\n\ni\u2208L m=\u2212s\n\n(\u2212)s\u2212m |s, mi \u2297 |s, \u2212mi\n\n\u0001\n\nii\u2032\n\n,\n\n(1.7)\n\n\f8\n\nCHAPTER 1. FRUSTRATED QUANTUM SPIN SYSTEMS\n\nis also a tensor product of spin-zero states.\nFinally, we would like to show that the projection onto the spin zero\npart of a state with p.s.d. coefficient matrix preserves its positivity. This\nis only of academic interest here, but it is non-trivial and may very well\nbe important for other physical questions. To find the projection onto spin\nzero we need to decompose the whole Hilbert space into tensor products\nof the spin components [j]k \u2297 [j \u2032 ]k\u2032 of the two subsystems; here k, k \u2032 are\nadditional quantum numbers that distinguish multiple multiplets with the\nsame spin j. Only tensor products with j = j \u2032 can have a spin zero subspace,\nj\nX\n|j, m, ki \u2297\nwhich is unique, in fact, and generated by the spin zero state\nm=\u2212j\n\n(\u2212)j\u2212m |j, \u2212m, k \u2032 i. Noting that (\u2212)j\u2212m |j, \u2212m, k \u2032 i is precisely the spin-rotated\nstate (|j, m, k \u2032 i)rot , we convince ourselves that the projection onto spin zero\namounts to a partial trace over m in a suitably parametrized matrix c. This\noperation preserves positive semidefiniteness, so we actually proved that the\ncheckerboard has at least one ground state that has both total spin zero and\na p.s.d. coefficient matrix c.\nWe do not know how many ground states there are. To determine the spin\nof any remaining ground states we add an external field to the hamiltonian\nand study the resulting magnetization. We will see that the spontaneous\nmagnetization of every box on the symmetry line vanishes for all ground\nstates, and thus if we have periodic boundary conditions in at least one\n3\nis a good quantum\ndirection, the total magnetization vanishes. Since Stot\n\u00b1\nnumber and Stot commute with the hamiltonian, this will imply that all\nground states in such a system have total spin zero. Let us thus modify the\n(3)\n(3)\n(3)\n(3)\noriginal hamiltonian (1.2) by replacing the term (s1 + s2 + s3 + s4 )2z for\n(3)\n(3)\n(3)\n(3)\na single box, z, on the symmetry line by (s1 + s2 + s3 + s4 \u2212 b)2z , i.e.,\neffectively adding a field b to the spins in box z and a constant term 21 b2 to the\n(3)\n(3)\nhamiltonian. We want to distribute the resulting b-terms (s1 + s2 \u2212 b/2)2 ,\n(3)\n(3)\n(3)\n(3)\n(3)\n(3)\n(s3 + s4 \u2212 b/2)2 , and 2(s1 + s2 \u2212 b/2)(s3 + s4 \u2212 b/2) to HL , HR , HC\nrespectively. We cannot use the spin rotation as before, because the crossing\nterms in the hamiltonian would no longer be left-right symmetric in the basis\n(1.3). To avoid this problem we will, instead, expand eigenstates \u03c8 in the\nsame basis on the left and on the right:\n\u03c8=\n\nX\n\u03b1,\u03b2\n\nc\u0303\u03b1\u03b2 \u03c8\u03b1L \u2297 \u03c8\u03b2R .\n\n(1.8)\n\nIn this basis the hamiltonian is left-right symmetric and we may assume,\nas before, that c\u0303 = c\u0303\u2020 . Except for the presence of b in box z the energy\n\n\f1.1. THE PYROCHLORE CHECKERBOARD\n\n9\n\nexpectations on the left and right are as before. The energy expectation of\nthe crossing terms of box z in the diagonal basis of c\u0303 is now\nX\n\u0001\n2\n(2)\n2\n(3)\n2\nc\u0303k c\u0303l |(t(1)\n.\nz )kl | \u2212 |(tz )kl | + |(tz )kl \u2212 b/2|\nk,l\n\nThis expression clearly does not increase if we replace the ck by their absolute\nvalue |ck | and change the signs of the first and last terms. The sign change\ncan be achieved by simultaneously performing a spin rotation and changing\nthe sign of the field b in the right subsystem. This actually completly removes\nb from the hamiltonian. We have thus shown that the ground state energies\nof the systems Hb with and H0 without the b-terms satisfy the inequality\nEb \u2265 E0 . Let |bi be a ground state of Hb and |0i a ground state of H0 . It\nfollows from the variational principle, that h0|Hb|0i \u2265 hb|Hb |bi = Eb \u2265 E0 .\n(3)\n(3)\n(3)\nExpressed in terms of spin operators this reads E0 \u2212 2h0|b(s1 + s2 + s3 +\n(3)\ns4 )z |0i + b2 \u2265 E0 . Recalling that we are free to choose both the sign and the\nmagnitude of b we find that the ground state magnetization of box z must\nbe zero:\n(3)\n(3)\n(3)\n(3)\nh0|(s1 + s2 + s3 + s4 )z |0i = 0.\n(1.9)\nThis quantum analog of the \"ice rule\" is true for any box on the symmetry\nline and it holds for all three spin components. In a system with periodic\nboundary conditions and an even number of sites in at least one direction\nwe can choose the symmetry line(s) to intersect any given box, so in such a\nsystem the magnetization is zero both for every single box separately and also\n(3)\nfor the whole system: h0|Stot |0i = 0. As mentioned previously this implies\nthat the total spin is zero for all ground states of such a system.\n\n1.1.4\n\nSusceptibility\n\nLet us return to the inequality Eb \u2265 E0 . It implies a bound on the local\n(3)\nsusceptibility of the system: Let E(b) \u2261 hb|H0 \u2212 bSbox |bi be the ground state\nenergy of the periodic pyrochlore checkerboard with a single box immersed\n(3)\nin an external field b. Recalling Hb = H0 \u2212 bSbox + 21 b2 , we see that the above\ninequality becomes E(b)+ 12 b2 \u2265 E(0) and, assuming differentiability, implies\nan upper bound on the susceptibility at zero field for single-box magnetization\n\u03c7loc\n\n1 \u2202 2 E(b)\n=\u2212\n\u03bb \u2202b2\n\nb=0\n\n1\n\u2264 ,\n4\n\n(1.10)\n\nwhere \u03bb = 4 is the number of spins in a box. (The susceptibility is given in\nnatural units in which we have absorbed the g-factor and Bohr magneton in\nthe definition of the field b.)\n\n\f10\n\nCHAPTER 1. FRUSTRATED QUANTUM SPIN SYSTEMS\n\nWe would like to get more detailed information about the response of the\nspin system to a global field {bx } in a hamiltonian H{bx } which is identical to\n(1.2), except for the terms for the third spin component, which are replaced\n(3)\n(3)\n(3)\n(3)\nby (s1 + s2 + s3 + s4 \u2212 bx )2x . From what we have seen so far, it is\napparent that the corresponding ground state energy E{bx } is extremal for\nbx = 0. With the help of a more sophisticated trace inequality [25, 2], that\nbecomes relevant whenever the matrix c in (1.3) cannot be diagonalized, one\ncan actually show that E{bx } has an absolute minimum at bx = 0:\nE{bx } \u2265 E0 .\n\n(1.11)\n\nNote that we had to put the field on the boxes for this result to hold; not\nevery field on the individual spins can be written this way. The special\nchoice bx = B/2 corresponds to a global homogenous field B on all spins.\n(The factor 1/2 adjusts for the fact that every spin is shared by two boxes.)\n(3)\nIf E(B) = hB|H0 \u2212 BStot |Bi is the ground state energy of the periodic\npyrochlore checkerboard in the external field B, then (1.11) implies E(B) +\n\u039b\nB 2 \u2265 E(0), and thus an upper bound on the susceptibility per site at zero\n16\nfield (in natural units)\n\u03c7=\u2212\n\n1 \u2202 2 E(B)\n\u039b \u2202B 2\n\nB=0\n\n1\n\u2264 ,\n8\n\n(1.12)\n\nwhere \u039b is the number of independent sites, which equals twice the number\nof boxes.\nAll these results continue to hold at finite temperature. The analog of\n(1.11) holds also for the partition function corresponding to H{bx } :\nZ{bx } \u2264 Z0 ,\n\n(1.13)\n\nas can be shown by a straightforward application of lemma 4.1 in section\n4 of [22] to the pyrochlore checkerboard. The physically relevant partition\nfunction for the periodic pyrochlore checkerboard at finite temperature in a\n(3)\nhomogenous external field, Z(B) \u2261 tr e\u2212\u03b2(H0 \u2212BStot ) , differs from Z{bx } , where\nbx = B/2, only by a factor corresponding to the constant term in H{bx } .

We could, e.g., have\ndiagonal bonds on every square, but then the horizontal and/or vertical\nbonds must have twice the coupling strength. Our results also apply to\nvarious 3-dimensional cubic versions of the checkerboard, e.g., with diagonal\ncrossing bonds in every other cube, see figure 1.6. While the method does\n\nFigure 1.6: A 3-dimensional checkerboard: Every cube has 8 vertices \u2013 each\nshared among two cubes.

FRUSTRATED QUANTUM SPIN SYSTEMS\n\nproperties to the pyrochlore checkerboard, which is also fully frustrated, and\nhas the added advantage of being more easily visualizeable.\n\n1.2\n1.2.1\n\nSinglets in reflection symmetric spin systems\nOrdering energy levels according to spin\n\nTotal spin is often a useful quantum number to classify energy eigenstates of\nspin systems. An example is the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg Hamiltonian\non a bipartite lattice, whose energy levels plotted versus total spin form\ntowers of states. The spin-zero tower extends furthest down the energy scale,\nthe spin-one tower has the next higher base, and so on, all the way up the spin\nladder: E(S + 1) > E(S), where E(S) denotes the lowest energy eigenvalue\nfor total spin S [21]. The ground state, in particular, has total spin zero;\nit is a singlet. This fact had been suspected for a long time, but the first\nrigorous proof was probably given by Marshall [26] for a one-dimensional\nantiferromagnetic chain with an even number of sites, each with intrinsic spin1/2 and with periodic boundary conditions. This system is bipartite, it can\nbe split into two subsystems, each of which contains only every other site, so\nthat all antiferromagnet bonds are between these subsystems. Marshall bases\nhis proof on a theorem that he attributes to Peierls: Any ground state of the\nsystem, expanded in terms of S (3) -eigenstates has coefficients with alternating\nsigns that depend on the S (3) -eigenvalue of one of the subsystems. After a\ncanonical transformation, consisting of a rotation of one of the subsystems\nby \u03c0 around the 2-axis in spin space, the theorem simply states that all\ncoefficients of a ground state can be chosen to be positive. To show that this\nimplies zero total spin, Marshall works in a subspace with S (3) -eigenvalue\nM = 0 and uses translation invariance. His argument easily generalizes to\nhigher dimensions and higher intrinsic spin. Lieb, Schultz and Mattis [27]\npoint out that translational invariance is not really necessary, only reflection\nsymmetry is needed to relate the two subsystems, and the ground state is\nunique in the connected case. Lieb and Mattis [21] ultimately remove the\nrequirement of translation invariance or reflection symmetry and apply the\nM-subspace method to classify excited states. Like Peierls they use a PerronFrobenius type argument to prove that in the S (3) -basis the ground state\nwave function for the connected case is a positive vector and it is unique.\nComparing this wave function with the positive wave function of a simple\nsoluble model in an appropriate M-subspace [23] they conclude that the\nground state has total spin S = |SA \u2212SB |, where SA and SB are the maximum\n\n\f1.2.

We shall now reintroduce reflection\nsymmetry, but for other reasons: we want to exploit methods and ideas of\n\"reflection positivity\" (see [22] and references therein.)

The main application is to frustrated spin systems similar to\nthe pyrochlore lattices discussed in the previous section.\n\n1.2.2\n\nReflection symmetric spin system\n\nWe would like to consider a spin system that consists of two subsystems\nthat are mirror images of one another, except for a rotation by \u03c0 around the\n2-axis in spin-space, and that has antiferromagnetic crossing bonds between\ncorresponding sets of sites of the two subsystems. The spin Hamiltonian is\nH = HL + HR + HC ,\n\n(1.17)\n\nand it acts on a tensor product of two identical copies of a Hilbert space that\ncarries a representation of SU(2). \"HL = H\u0303R \" in the sense that HL = h \u2297 1\nand HR = 1 \u2297 h\u0303, where the tilde shall henceforth denote the rotation by \u03c0\naround the 2-axis in spin-space.

The overlap of any state with coefficient matrix c with the canonical\nstate \u039e is simply the trace of c. In the previous section we found that the\nreflection symmetric spin system necessarily has a ground state with positive\nsemidefinite, non-zero coefficient matrix, which, by definition, has a (nonzero) positive trace. Since the trace is proportional to the overlap with the\ncanonical spin-zero state, we have now shown that there is always a ground\nstate that contains a spin-zero part. Provided that total spin is a good quantum number, we can conclude further that our system always has a ground\nstate with total spin zero, i.e., a singlet.\nProjection onto spin zero\nP\nConsider any state \u03c8 =\nc\u03b1\u03b2 \u03c8\u03b1 \u2297 \u03c8e\u03b2 with positive semidefinite c = |c|.

A convenient parametrisation of the S 3\neigenstates \u03c8\u03b1 for this task is, as before, \u03b1 = (j, m, k), where k labels spin-j\nmultiplets [j]k in the decomposition of the Hilbert space of one subsystem\ninto components of total spin.

By symmetry (1.27)\nwill also be true for the first spin component and, if we are dealing with a\nspin Hamiltonian that is invariant under spin rotations, it is also true for the\nsecond spin component. For ground states with symmetric or antisymmetric\n(3)\n(3)\ncoefficient matrix we automatically have hsi + si\u2032 i = 0 for any pair of sites\ni and i\u2032 , so in that case (1.27) is trivial.\nFor the proof we introduce a real parameter b in the spin Hamiltonian:\n(3)\n(3)\nH(b) \u2261 H \u2212 b(SB + SB\u2032 ) + b2 /2, where B is one of the sets of sites involved\nin the crossing bonds of the original Hamiltonian H.

If we now\nwrite the ground state energy expectation of H(b) as a matrix expression like\n(1.5) and apply the trace inequality to it, we will find an equal or lower energy\nexpectation not of H(b), but rather of H: The trace inequality effectively\nremoves the parameter b from the Hamiltonian. By the variational principle\nthe true ground state energy of H is even lower and we conclude that Eb \u2265\nE0 . Role of the technical assumptions mentioned above: If h = hT , then\nthe transpose in the second term in (1.5) vanishes, the matrix expression is\nsymmetric in cL and cR (except for the sign of the parameter b), and the trace\ninequality gives hH(b)ic \u2265 12 {hHicL + hHicR }. If h = h\u0303, then we should drop\nthe spin rotation on the second term of the analog of expression (1.18) for\n\u03c8b . The matrix expression for hH(b)i is then symmetric in c and cT and we\nmay assume c = \u00b1cT to prove Eb \u2265 E0 . The calculation is similar to the\none in section 1.2.4. Note, that c = \u00b1cT only enters the proof of Eb \u2265 E0 ,\nwe still do not need to assume that the coefficient matrix of \u03c80 in (1.27) has\nthat property.\nThe preferred configurations of four spins with antiferromagnetic crossed\nbonds in a classical Ising system are very similar to the configurations of the\nfour hydrogen atoms that surround each oxygen atom in ice (Fig. 1.10): There\nare always two hydrogen atoms close and two further away from each oxygen\natom, and there are always two spins \"up\" and two \"down\", i.e. M = 0,\nin the Ising system. Equation (1.27) is a (generalized) quantum mechanical\nversion of this \u2013 that is why we use the term \"ice rule\". This phrase is also\nused in the context of ferromagnetic pyrochlore with Ising anisotropy (\"spin\nice\") [28] and we hope that does not cause confusion.\n\n\f20\n\n1.2.6\n\nCHAPTER 1. FRUSTRATED QUANTUM SPIN SYSTEMS\n\nComparison with previous results\n\nWe would like to discuss similarities between our method and previous work,\nin particular the approach of [21] for the bipartite antiferromagnet: There,\nthe spin Hamiltonian splits into two parts\nP H = H0 + H1 . The expectation\nvalue of H0 with respect to a state \u03c8 = f\u03b1 \u03c6\u03b1 , expanded in an appropriate\nbasis {\u03c6\u03b1 }, depends only on |f\u03b1 |, and the expectation of H1 does not increase\nunder the transformation f\u03b1 \u2192 |f\u03b1 |. The variational principle then implies\nthat there must be a ground state with only non-negative coefficients |f\u03b1 |.\nThe present setup is very similar, except that we use coefficient matrices\n(c\u03b1\u03b2 ) to expand states, since we work on a tensor product of Hilbert spaces.\nIn our case the expectation value of H0 = HL + HR depends only on c via\nthe positive matrices cL and cR , and the expectation value of HC increases\nif we \"replace\" c by these positive matrices. The similarity is even more\napparent if h has real matrix elements: In that case we may assume that c\nis diagonalisable and its eigenvalues play the role of the coefficients f\u03b1 . The\nspin of a positive ground state is established in all cases from the overlap\nwith a state of known spin that is also positive. In a system with sufficient\nsymmetry we can, however, also use the \"ice rule\" to prove that all ground\nstates have total spin zero [1]. (E.g., in a system with constant coefficients\nji and enough translational invariance, so that every spin can be considered\nto be involved in a crossing bond and thus in an ice rule, we would conclude\n(3)\nthat all ground states have Stot = 0 and, assuming rotational invariance in\nspin space, Stot = 0.) It is not clear, if M-subspace methods can be used in\nthe present setting to get information about excited states. An important\npoint in the our work is that we consider not only antiferromagnetic bonds\nbetween single sites but also bonds between sets of sites. This frees us from\nthe requirement of bipartiteness and even allows some ferromagnetic crossing\nbonds, for example in (s1 \u2212 s2 )(s1\u2032 \u2212 s2\u2032 ). There is no doubt that the scheme\ncan be further generalized, e.g., to other groups or more abstract \"crossing\nbonds\". In the present form the most interesting applications are in the field\nof frustrated spin systems [1].\nWe did not address the question of the degeneracy of ground states. Classically a characteristic feature of frustrated systems is their large ground state\ndegeneracy. For frustrated quantum spin systems this is an important open\nproblem.\n\n\fChapter 2\nWehrl entropy of Bloch coherent\nstates\nThere is a hybrid between the quantum mechanical entropy, \u2212tr\u03c1 ln \u03c1, and\nthe entropy of the corresponding classical system: Wehrl proposed to use\nthe expectation hz|\u03c1|zi of the density matrix between\nR coherent states as\nprobability density for the Shannon entropy; SW = \u2212 dz hz|\u03c1|zi lnhz|\u03c1|zi.\nIt turns out that this entropy has nice properties, some of which either of\nits 'parents' lack: The Wehrl entropy is sub-additive, monotone and always\npositive \u2013 even for pure states. In fact, it is always larger than the quantum\nentropy.\nWehrl conjectured that the minimum of SW for a single particle on the\nline is reached only for density matrices that are projectors onto coherent\nstates. This was proved by Lieb using advanced theorems in Fourier analysis.\nWhile it is well-known that entropy considerations can lead to non-trivial\ninequalities (they e.g. improve on Heisenberg's uncertainty), it was still quite\nsurprising that the proof of Wehrl's conjecture was so hard. In an effort\nto shed more light on this, Lieb was led to a related conjecture for Bloch\ncoherent states. Even though many attempts have been made to find a proof\nof the latter, there had been virtually no progress for the last twenty years.\nUsing a geometric representation of spin states we will see in the following\nsections how to compute the Wehrl entropy explicitly and will settle the\nconjecture for cases of low spin. We will also give a group theoretic proof for\nall spin of a related inequality.\nSharp inequalities that stem from entropy considerations have in the past\nbeen seen to be very useful in mathematical physics. In this particular case\nthere is a way to use Lieb's conjecture to get much better approximations\nto probability distributions than are in use today. There is also a direct\nphysical interpretation: The Wehrl Entropy for states of spin j is the entropy\n21\n\n\f22\n\nCHAPTER 2.

We find that a proof of Lieb's conjecture\nfor low spins can be reduced to some beautiful spherical geometry, but the\nunreasonable difficulty of a complete proof is still a great puzzle; its resolution\nmay very well lead to interesting mathematics and perhaps physics.\nThe results have been published in [3], the remainder of this chapter is\nbased on that publication. Much of the early work was done in collaboration\nwith Wolfgang Spitzer who\n\n2.1\n\nConjectures of Wehrl and Lieb\n\nFor a quantum mechanical system with density matrix \u03c1, Hilbert space H,\nand a family of normalized\ncoherent states |zi, parametrized symbolically\nR\nby z and satisfying dz |zihz| = 1 (resolution of identity), the Wehrl entropy [44] is\nZ\nSW (\u03c1) = \u2212\n\ndz hz|\u03c1|zi lnhz|\u03c1|zi,\n\n(2.1)\n\ni.e., this new entropy is the ordinary Shannon entropy of the probability\ndensity provided by the lower symbol of the density matrix. If we are dealing\nwith a tensor product H1 \u2297 H2 of Hilbert spaces we can either consider the\ntotal entropy S12 directly, or we can use partial traces to compute reduced\ndensity matrices \u03c11 , \u03c12 and the associated entropies S1 and S2 . It would be\nphysically desirable to have inequalities\nS1 \u2264 S12 \u2264 S1 + S2\n\n(2.2)\n\nbut it turns out that while subadditivity S12 \u2264 S1 + S2 is no problem, monotonicity S1 \u2264 S1 + S2 in general fails for quantum entropy and for classical\ncontinuous entropy. For the Wehrl entropy, however, both inequalities are\nvalid. Furthermore it also satisfies concavity in \u03c1 and strong subadditivity [35, 36].\nLike quantum mechanical entropy, SQ = \u2212tr \u03c1 ln \u03c1, Wehrl entropy is always non-negative, in fact SW > SQ \u2265 0. In view of this inequality it is\ninteresting to ask for the minimum of SW and the corresponding minimizing density matrix. It follows from concavity of \u2212x ln x that a minimizing\ndensity matrix must be a pure state, i.e., \u03c1 = |\u03c8ih\u03c8| for a normalized vector\n|\u03c8i \u2208 H [34]. (Note that SW (|\u03c8ih\u03c8|) depends on |\u03c8i and is non-zero, unlike\nthe quantum entropy which is of course zero for pure states.)\nFor Glauber coherent states Wehrl conjectured [44] and Lieb proved [34]\nthat the minimizing state |\u03c8i is again a coherent state. It turns out that all\n\n\f2.1. CONJECTURES OF WEHRL AND LIEB\n\n23\n\nGlauber coherent states have Wehrl entropy one, so Wehrl's conjecture can\nbe written as follows:\nTheorem 2.1.1 (Lieb) The minimum of SW (\u03c1) for states in H = L2 (R) is\none,\nZ\nSW (|\u03c8ih\u03c8|) = \u2212 dz |h\u03c8|zi|2 ln |h\u03c8|zi|2 \u2265 1,\n(2.3)\n\nwith equality if and only if |\u03c8i is a coherent state.\n\nTo prove this, Lieb used a clever combination of the sharp Hausdorff-Young\ninequality [30, 37, 39] and the sharp Young inequality [31, 30, 37, 39] to show\nthat\nZ\ns dz |hz|\u03c8i|2s \u2264 1, s \u2265 1,\n(2.4)\n\nagain with equality if and only if |\u03c8i is a coherent state. Wehrl's conjecture\nfollows from this in the limit s \u2192 1 essentially because (2.3) is the derivative\nof (2.4) with respect to s at s = 1. All this easily generalizes to L2 (Rn )\n[34, 38].\nThe lower bound on the Wehrl entropy is related to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle [29, 32] and it has been speculated that SW can be used to\nmeasure uncertainty due to both quantum and thermal fluctuations [32].\nIt is very surprising that 'heavy artillery' like the sharp constants in the\nmentioned inequalities are needed in Lieb's proof. To elucidate this situation, Lieb suggested [34] studying the analog of Wehrl's conjecture for Bloch\ncoherent states |\u03a9i, where one should expect significant simplification since\nthese are finite dimensional Hilbert spaces. However, no progress has been\nmade, not even for a single spin, even though many attempts have been made\n[35]. Attempts to proceed again along the lines of Lieb's original proof have\nfailed to provide a sharp inequality and the direct computation of the entropy\nand related integrals, even numerically, was unsuccessful [42].\nThe key idea turns out to be a geometric representation of a state of\nspin j as 2j points on a sphere. In this representation the expression |h\u03a9|\u03c8i|2\nfactorizes into a product of 2j functions fi on the sphere, which measure the\nsquare chordal distance from the antipode of the point parametrized by \u03a9 to\neach of the 2j points on the sphere. Lieb's conjecture, in a generalized form\nanalogous to (2.4), then looks like the quotient of two H\u00f6lder inequalities\nQ2j\n||f1 * * * f2j ||s\n||fi ||2js\n\u2264 Qi=1\n,\n(2.5)\n2j\n||f1 * * * f2j ||1\ni=1 ||fi ||2j\nwith the one with the higher power winning against the other one. We shall\ngive a group theoretic proof of this inequality for the special case s \u2208 N in\ntheorem 2.2.8.\n\n\f24\n\nCHAPTER 2. WEHRL ENTROPY OF BLOCH COHERENT STATES\n\nIn the geometric representation the Wehrl entropy of spin states finds a\ndirect physical interpretation: It is the classical entropy of a single particle\non a sphere interacting via Coulomb potential with 2j fixed sources; s plays\nthe role of inverse temperature.\nThe entropy integral (2.1) can now be done because |h\u03a9|\u03c8i|2 factorizes\nand one finds a formula for the Wehrl entropy of any state. When we evaluate\nthe entropy explicitly for states of spin 1, 3/2, and 2 we find surprisingly\nsimple expressions solely in terms of the square chordal distances between\nthe points on the sphere that define the given state.\nA different, more group theoretic approach seems to point to a connection\nbetween Lieb's conjecture and the norm of certain spin js states with 1 \u2264\ns \u2208 R [33]. So far, however, this has only been useful for proving the analog\nof inequality (2.4) for s \u2208 N.\n\n2.1.1\n\nBloch coherent spin states\n\nGlauber coherent states\n1\n\n2\n\n|zi = \u03c0 \u2212 4 e\u2212(x\u2212q) /2 eipx ,\n(2.6)\n\u221a\nparametrized by z = (q + ip)/ 2 and equiped with a measure dz = dpdq/2\u03c0,\nare usually\nintroduced as eigenvectors of the annihilation operator a = (x\u0302 +\n\u221a\nip\u0302)/ 2, a|zi = z|zi, but the same states can also be obtained by the action\nof the Heisenberg-Weyl group H4 = {a\u2020 a, a\u2020 , a, I} on the extremal state\n1\n2\n|0i = \u03c0 \u2212 4 e\u2212x /2 . Glauber coherent states are thus elements of the coset space\nof the Heisenberg-Weyl group modulo the stability subgroup U(1)\u2297U(1) that\nleaves the extremal state invariant. (See e.g. [45] and references therein.)\nThis construction easily generalizes to other groups, in particular to SU(2),\nwhere it gives the Bloch coherent spin states [41] that we are interested\nin: Here the Hilbert space can be any one of the finite dimensional spin-j\nrepresentations [j] \u2261 C2j+1 of SU(2), j = 12 , 1, 32 , . . ., and the extremal state\nfor each [j] is the highest weight vector |j, ji. The stability subgroup is U(1)\nand the coherent states are thus elements of the sphere S2 =SU(2)/U(1);\nthey can be labeled by \u03a9 = (\u03b8, \u03c6) and are obtained from |j, ji by rotation:\n|\u03a9ij = Rj (\u03a9)|j, ji.\nFor spin j =\n\n1\n2\n\n(2.7)\n\nwe find\n1\n\n\u03c6\n\n1\n\n\u03c6\n\n|\u03c9i = p 2 e\u2212i 2 | \u2191i + (1 \u2212 p) 2 ei 2 | \u2193i,\n\n(2.8)\n\nwith p \u2261 cos2 2\u03b8 .

Consider a sphere of radius 12 , with points 1, 2, 3 on its\nsurface, and two planes through its center; the first plane containing points\n1 and 3, the second plane containing points 2 and 3. The intersection angle\n\u03c6 of these two planes satisfies\np\n2 cos \u03c6 \u01eb\u03bc(1 \u2212 \u01eb)(1 \u2212 \u03bc) = \u01eb + \u03bc \u2212 \u03bd \u2212 2\u01eb\u03bc.\n(2.35)\n\n\u03c6 is the azimuthal angle of point 2, if point 3 is at the 'north pole' of the\nsphere and point 1 is assigned zero azimuthal angle.\nThe states |\u03c8 (1) i, |\u03c8 (2) i, and |\u03c8 (3) i all have one point at the north pole of\n(i)\nthe sphere. It is enough to compute the values of |\u03c8m |2 for one i, the other\nvalues can be found by appropriate permutation of \u01eb, \u03bc, \u03bd.

The original conjecture 2.1.2 follows from it in the limit\ns \u2192 1. For s = 1 we simply get the norm of the spin j state |\u03c8i,\nZ\nd\u03a9\n(2j + 1)\n|h\u03a9|\u03c8ij |2 = |Pj |\u03c8i|2,\n(2.59)\n4\u03c0\nwhere Pj is the projector onto spin j. We have numerical evidence for low\nspin that an analog of conjecture 2.2.7 holds in fact for a much larger class\nof convex functions than xs or x ln x.\nFor s \u2208 N there is a surprisingly simple group theoretic argument based\non (2.59):\nTheorem 2.2.8 Conjecture 2.2.7 holds for s \u2208 N.\nRemark: For spin 1 and spin 3/2 (at s = 2) this was first shown by Wolfgang\nSpitzer by direct computation of the integral.\nProof: Let us consider s = 2, |\u03c8i \u2208 [j] with ||\u03c8i|2 = 1, rewrite (2.58) as\nfollows and use (2.59)\nZ\nd\u03a9\n|h\u03a9|\u03c8i|2*2\n(2j * 2 + 1)\n4\u03c0\nZ\nd\u03a9\n= (2(2j) + 1)\n|h\u03a9 \u2297 \u03a9|\u03c8 \u2297 \u03c8i|2 = |P2j |\u03c8 \u2297 \u03c8i|2 .

There has been some progress and it is now clear\nthat there will not be an argument as simple as the one given above [33].\nCoherent states of the form discussed in [43] (for the hydrogen atom) could\nbe of importance here, since they easily generalize to non-integer 'spin'.\nTheorem 2.2.8 provides a quick, crude, lower limit on the entropy:\n\n\f2.2.

WEHRL ENTROPY OF BLOCH COHERENT STATES\n\n\fChapter 3\nSymmetries of the Hubbard model\nResearch on high temperature superconductivity in cuprates has greatly revived interest in the Hubbard model [46] as a model of strongly correlated\nelectron systems [47, 48, 50]. Despite its formal simplicity this model continues to resist complete analytical or numerical understanding. Symmetries of the Hubbard Hamiltonian play a major role in the reduction of the\nproblem. They have for instance been used to construct eigenstates of the\nHamiltonian with off-diagonal long range order [51], to simplify numerical\ndiagonalization[52] and to show completeness of the solution [53] to the onedimensional model [54].\nIn addition to the regular spin su(2) symmetry, the Hubbard model has a\nsecond su(2) symmetry at half filling, which is called pseudo-spin [55, 51, 56].\nThis is a consequence of the particle hole symmetry at half filling, which\nmaps su(2)-spin into su(2)-pseudo-spin and vice versa. According to Yang\nthe generators of the pseudo-spin symmetry indicate off-diagonal long range\norder. The closest thing to a rigorous prove of long range order at half filling\nis Lieb's proof that the ground state of both the repulsive and the attractive\nHubbard model is a singlet in this case. In the physically interesting repulsive\ncase I was able to extend this result to show that in fact all energy levels are\narranged according to spin at half-filling. For this I used reflection positivity\narguments to prove that the Hubbard states have non-vanishing overlap with\nspecial states of known spin. A similar result has been independently found\nby Tasaki using arguments related to the prove of the Lieb-Mattis theorem.\nAway from half-filling the symmetry of the Hubbard model and also that\nof related models is deformed to a special kind of quantum group symmetry,\nas we will discuss in the following sections. This suggests that even away\nfrom half-filling the energy levels of the Hubbard model should be arranged\naccording to their spin. There are simple qualitative arguments in the limits\nof strong and weak on-site interaction: Consider the attractive case. In the\n37\n\n\f38\n\nCHAPTER 3. SYMMETRIES OF THE HUBBARD MODEL\n\nlimit of weak interaction the kinetic energy (hopping term) dominates and\nenergy levels will fill up pair-wise with spin singlets until only spins of one\ntype are left over. If there are n spin \"up\" and m spin \"down\" electrons then\nthe ground state will have total spin 1/2 * |m \u2212 n|. In the limit of strong\ninteraction the result is the same. Electrons will again try to minimize the\nground state energy by arranging themselfs in pairs (this time in position\nspace instead of momentum space) until only electrons of one type are left\nover. The conjecture is thus that this is also true for all intermediate coupling\nstrengths. A corresponding conjecture for the physically more interesting\nrepulsive case can be found by a particle-hole transformation on every other\nsite.\nIn his proof Lieb expanded states of the Hubbard model in terms of a\nbasis of electron states with spin \"up\" and a dual basis of electron states\nwith spin \"down\",\nX\n\u03c8=\ncij \u03c8\u2191i \u2297 \u03c8\u2193j ,\n\nand then used trace-inequalities for the coefficient matrices cij as is familiar\nto us from chapter 1. Lieb worked at half-filling, so the cij were square\nmatrices in his case and the required trace-inequalities were already known\nfrom older work on reflection positivity. Away from half-filling (repulsive\ncase) or for Sz 6= 0 (attractive case) the coefficient matrices are rectangular\nand appropriate trace inequalities that would prove the conjecture are not\nknown. It is possible, however, to find inequalities that relate rectangular to\nsquare matrices. These also give interesting information about the ground\nstate of the Hubbard model and are in fact the same inequalities that let to\nthe breakthrough in the mathematically closely related work on frustrated\nquantum spin systems (see chapter 1).\nIn the following we will discuss so-called superconducting quantum symmetries in extended one-band one-dimensional Hubbard models. We will\nsee that they originate from classical (pseudo-)spin symmetries of a class of\nmodels of which the standard Hubbard model is a special case. Motivated by\nthis we give the Hamiltonian of the most general extended Hubbard model\nwith spin and pseudo-spin symmetry. (As far as we know this result has\nnot appeared in the literature before.) The quantum symmetric models provide extra parameters, which makes them interesting for phenomenology, but\nthey are restricted to one dimension. The equivalent new models with classical symmetries do not have that drawback. Especially notworthy is that\nthe filling factor is one of the free parameters.

The mutually orthogonal algebras generated by (3.2) and (3.3) are isomorphic to the algebra generated\n2\nby the Pauli matrices and have unit elements 1s = Hs2 , 1m = Hm\nwith\n1s + 1m = 1. The superconducting generators commute with each term of\nthe local part H (loc) (first two terms) of the Hubbard Hamiltonian (3.1) provided that \u03bc = u/2. This can either be seen by direct computation or by\nstudying the action of the generators on the four possible electron states at\neach site. It is also easily seen that the magnetic generators commute with\neach term of H (loc) ; in the following we will however focus predominantly on\nthe superconducting symmetry.\nTo check the symmetry of the non-local hopping term we have to consider\nP\nglobal generators O: These generators are here simply given by the sum Oi\n1\n\nWe will use the convention that operators at different sites commute.

Another distinguishing property of this classical\ncoproduct is its symmetry (cocommutativity). This property and coassociativity ensure that we can arrange that the two factors of the last coproduct\ncoincide with any given pair hi, ji of next-neighbor sites; see Fig. 3.1. It\nis hence enough to study symmetry of a single next-neighbor term of the\nHamiltonian to prove global symmetry.\n\n3.1.2\n\nQuantum symmetries\n\nThe (pseudo-)spin symmetries of the standard Hubbard model are restricted\nto the case of an average of one electron per site (half-filling), so recent speculations [57] about extended Hubbard models with generalized (quantum\ngroup) symmetries away from half-filling attracted some attention. A careful\nanalysis of the new models reveals that this quantum symmetry exists only\non one-dimensional lattices and in an appropriate approximation seems still\nto be restricted to half-filling. Despite these shortcomings the existence of\nnovel symmetries in Hubbard models is very interesting and worth investigating. Quantum symmetries of the Hubbard model were first investigated\nin the form of Yangians [58]; quantum supersymmetries of Hubbard models have also been considered [59]. In the following we shall investigate the\norigin of quantum symmetries in extended Hubbard models. We will find a\none-to-one correspondence between Hamiltonians with quantum and classical\nsymmetries. Guided by our results we will then be able to identify models\nwhose symmetries are neither restricted to one-dimensional lattices nor to\nhalf filling.\n\n\f41\n\n3.1.

It immediately follows that H (loc) has a local\nquantum symmetry. As is, this is a trivial statement because we did not yet\nconsider global quantum symmetries.

The idea of [57] was to\nachieve this by including phonons. Before we proceed to study the resulting\nextended Hubbard Hamiltonian Hext , we would like to make two remarks:\n(i) We call a Hamiltonian quantum symmetric if it commutes with all global\ngenerators. This implies invariance under the quantum adjoint action and\nvice versa. (ii) Coproducts of quantum groups are coassociative but not cocommutative. This means that the reduction of global symmetry to that\nof next-neighbor terms holds only for one-dimensional lattices. The practical implication is an absence of quantum symmetries for higher-dimensional\nlattices. (For a triangular lattice this is illustrated in Fig. 3.2.)\n\n3.1.3\n\nExtended Hubbard model with phonons\n\nThe extended Hubbard model of [57] (with some modifications [8]) introduces\nEinstein oscillators (parameters: M, \u03c9) and electron-phonon couplings (local:\n~\u03bb-term, non-local: via Tij\u03c3 ):\nX\nX\nX\nHext = u\nni\u2191 ni\u2193 \u2212 \u03bc\nni\u03c3 \u2212 ~\u03bb *\nni\u03c3 ~xi +\ni\n\ni,\u03c3\n\ni\u03c3\n\n\f42\n\nCHAPTER 3.

For ~\u03ba = 0 the model reduces to the Hubbard model with phonons and atomic orbitals \u03c8(r) \u223c exp(\u2212\u03b6r) in s-wave\napproximation [8].\nThe local part of Hext commutes with the generators of SUq (2)s iff\n\u03bc=\n\n~\u03bb2\nu\n\u2212\n.\n2 M\u03c9 2\n\n(3.8)\n\n(For technical reasons one needs to use modified generators X\u0303s\u00b1 \u2261 e\u22132i~\u03ba*~p Xs\u00b1\nhere that however still satisfy the SUq (2) algebra.)\nThe nonlocal part of Hext and thereby the whole extended Hubbard Hamiltonian commutes with the global generators iff\n~\u03bb = ~M\u03c9 2~\u03ba,\nq = exp(2\u03ba\u03b6~),\n(3.9)\nwhere \u03ba \u2261 \u2212\u00eaij * ~\u03ba for i, j ordered next neighbour sites. For q 6= 1 the symmetry is restricted to models given on a 1-dimensional lattice with naturally\nordered sites.\nFrom what we have seen so far we could be let to the premature conclusion that the quantum symmetry is due to phonons and that we have found\nsymmetry away from half filling because \u03bc 6= u/2. However: the pure Hubbard model with phonons has ~\u03ba = 0 and hence a classical symmetry (q = 1).\nFurthermore ~\u03bb 6= 0 implies non-vanishing local electron-phonon coupling so\nthat a mean field approximation cannot be performed and we simply do not\nknow how to compute the actual filling.

There are however still open questions: (i)\nDoes a new model exist that is equivalent to Hq-sym in 1-D but can also be\nformulated on higher dimensional lattices without breaking the symmetry?\n\n\f44\n\nCHAPTER 3. SYMMETRIES OF THE HUBBARD MODEL\n\nThis would be important for realistic models, see Fig. 3.3. (ii) Are there models with symmetry away from half-filling? (iii) What is the precise relation\nbetween models with classical and quantum symmetry in this setting?\nAs we shall see the answer to the last question also leads to the resolution\nof the first two. Without loss of generality (see argument given above) we\nwill focus on one pair of next-neighbor sites in the following. We shall present\ntwo approaches that supplement each other:\n\n3.2.1\n\nGeneralized Lang-Firsov transformation\n\nWe recall that the Hubbard model with phonons (with classical symmetry)\ncan be transformed into the standard Hubbard Hamiltonian in two steps: A\nLang-Firsov transformation changes the model to one with vanishing local\nphonon coupling and a mean field approximation removes the phonon operators from the model by averaging over Einstein oscillator eigenstates [62].\nThere exists a similar transformation that relates the extended Hubbard\nmodel (with quantum symmetry) to the standard Hubbard model:\nHext \u2190\u2192 Hq-sym \u2190\u2192 HHub .\n(We have already seen the first step of this transformation above in (3.10).)\nIt is easy to see that the hopping terms of Hq-sym and HHub have different spectrum so the transformation that we are looking for cannot be an\nequivalence transformation. There exists however an invertible operator M,\nwith MM \u2217 = 1 + (\u03b12 \u2212 1)\u03be, \u03be 2 = \u03be (i.e.similar to a partial isometry), that\ntransforms the coproducts of the classical Chevalley generators into their\nJimbo-Drinfel'd quantum counterparts\nM\u2206c (X \u00b1 )s M \u2217 = \u2206q (X \u00b1 )s\nM\u2206c (H)s M \u2217 = \u2206q (H)s ,\n\n(3.16)\n\nand the standard Hubbard Hamiltonian into Hq-sym\nMHHub M \u2217 = Hq-sym .\n\n(3.17)\n\nM = 1 \u2297 1 + (\u03b1 \u2212 1)\u03be + \u03b2f,\n\n(3.18)\n\nThis operator M is\nwith f = Xs\u2212 \u2297 Xs+ \u2212 Xs+ \u2297 Xs\u2212 , \u03be = \u2212f 2 = 21 (Hs2 \u2297 Hs2 \u2212 Hs \u2297 Hs ) and\n1\n\u03b1 \u00b1 \u03b2 = q \u00b1 2 . With this knowledge the proof of the quantum symmetry of\nHext is greatly simplified.\n\n\f45\n\n3.2. QUANTUM SYMMETRY UNRAVELED\n\n3.2.2\n\nQuantum vs. Classical Groups-Twists\n\nA systematic way to study the relation of quantum and classical symmetries\nwas given by Drinfel'd [63]. He argues that the classical U(g) and q-deformed\nUq (g) universal enveloping algebras are isomorphic as algebras. The relation\nof the Hopf algebra structures is slightly more involved: the undeformed\nuniversal enveloping algebra U(g) of a Lie algebra, interpreted as a quasiassociative Hopf algebra whose coassociator is an invariant 3-tensor, is twistequivalent to the Hopf algebra Uq (g) (over [[ln q]]).\nAll we need to know here is that classical (\u2206c ) and quantum (\u2206q ) coproducts are related via conjugation (\"twist\") by the so-called universal\n\u02c6\n:\nF \u2208 Uq (su2 )\u22972\n\u2206q (x) = F \u2206c (x)F \u22121 .\n(3.19)\n(For notational simplicity we did not explicitly write the map that describes\nthe algebra isomorphism of U(su2 ) and Uq (su2 ) but we should not be fooled by\nthe apparent similarity between (3.16) and (3.19): The algebra isomorphism\ndoes not map Chevalley generators to Jimbo-Drinfel'd generators and M is\nnot a representation of F .)\nThe fundamental matrix representation of the universal F for SU(N) is\nan orthogonal matrix\nX\nX\n\u03c1\u22972 (F ) =\neii \u2297 eii + cos \u03c6\neii \u2297 ejj\ni\n\n+ sin \u03c6\n\nX\ni<j\n\ni6=j\n\n(eij \u2297 eji \u2212 eji \u2297 eij ) ,\n\n(3.20)\n\np\nwhere cos \u03c6 \u00b1 sin \u03c6 = 2q \u00b11 /(q + q \u22121 ) , i, j = 1 . . . N and eij are N\u00d7N\nmatrices with lone \"1\" at position (i, j). The universal F in the superconducting spin- 12 representation, i.e. essentially the N = 2 case with the Pauli\nmatrices replaced by (3.3), is\nFs = exp(\u03c6f )s = \u03be \u0303 + cos \u03c6 \u03be + sin \u03c6 f\n\n(3.21)\n\nand \u03be \u0303 + \u03be = 1s \u2297 1s . We are interested in a representation of the universal F\non the 16-dimensional Hilbert space of states of two sites:\nF = (\u01ebm \u2295 \u03c1s )\u22972 (F ) = exp(\u03c6f )\n= 1 \u2297 1 \u2212 1s \u2297 1s + Fs .\n\n(3.22)\n\nNote that the trivial magnetic representation \u01ebm enters here even though we\ndecided to study only deformations of the superconducting symmetry-Fs\n\n\f46\n\nCHAPTER 3. SYMMETRIES OF THE HUBBARD MODEL\n\nalone would have been identically zero on the hopping term and would hence\nhave lead to a trivial model.\nWe now face a puzzle: By construction F \u22121 Hq-sym F should commute\nwith the (global) generators of SUq (2)s just like HHub . But F \u22121 Hq-sym F\nobviously has the same spectrum as Hq-sym so it cannot be equal to HHub .\nThere must be other models with the same symmetries. In fact we find a\nsix-parameter family of classically symmetric models in any dimension. In\nthe one-dimensional case twist-equivalent quantum symmetric models can\nbe constructed as deformations of each of these classical models. HHub and\nHq-sym are not a twist-equivalent pair but all models mentioned are related\nby generalized Lang-Firsov transformations.\nTo close we would like to present the most general Hamiltonian with\nSU(2) \u00d7 SU(2)/Z2 symmetry and symmetric next-neighbor terms. (The\ngroup-theoretical derivation and detailed description of this model is quite\ninvolved and will be given elsewhere.)

One parameter can be absorbed\ninto an overall multiplicative constant, so we have six free parameters. The\nfirst three terms comprise the standard Hubbard model but now without\nthe restriction to half-filling. The filling factor is fixed by the coefficient of\nthe pair hopping term (6th term). The number e in the denominator of this\ncoefficient is the number of edges per site. For a single pair of sites e = 1, for\na one-dimensional chain e = 2, for a honeycomb lattice e = 3, for a square\nlattice e = 4, for a triangular lattice e = 6 and for a D-dimensional hypercube\n\n\f3.2. QUANTUM SYMMETRY UNRAVELED\n\n47\n\ne = 2D. For a model on a general graph e will vary with the site. The 4th\nand 5th term describe density-density interaction for anti-parallel and parallel\nspins respectively. The balance of these two interactions is governed by the\ncoefficient of the spin-wave term (7th term). The last term is a modified\nhopping term that is reminiscent of the hopping term in the t-J model with\nhopping strength depending on the occupation of the sites; after deformation\nthis term is the origin of the non-trivial quantum symmetries of Hsym .\nThe known and many new quantum symmetric Hubbard models can be\nderived from Hsym by twisting as described above. While the deformation\nprovides up to two extra parameters for the quantum symmetric models the\nadvantage of the corresponding classical models is that they are not restricted\nto one dimension. There are both classically and quantum symmetric models\nwith symmetries away from half filling.\nThe way the filling and the spin-spin interactions appear as coefficients\nof the pair-hopping and spin-wave terms respectively looks quite promising\nfor a physical interpretation. Due to its symmetries Hsym should share some\nof the nice analytical properties of the standard Hubbard Hamiltonian and\ncould hence be of interest in its own right.\n\n\f48\n\nCHAPTER 3. SYMMETRIES OF THE HUBBARD MODEL\n\n\fChapter 4\nSolution by factorization of\nquantum integrable systems\nAdler, Kostant and Symes have introduced a beautiful unifying approach to\nthe construction and solution by factorization of classical integrable systems\nin the framework of Lie and Lie-Poisson groups. In collaboration with B.\nJur\u010do an analogous quantum mechanical construction was found with the\nHeisenberg equations of motion in quantum Lax form. Like in the classical\ntheory, the equations of motion are linearized and solved in an enlarged space\n(the Heisenberg double); the solution to the original problem is then found\nby factorization. For this project a formalism based on quantum groups was\nintroduced that can handle the dual non-commutativities (quantum commutators and group structure). The method can be further generalized to\nthe case of face Hopf algebras (elliptic quantum groups with dynamical Rmatrices.) We give the construction of twisted and untwisted quantum Lax\nequations associated with quantum groups and solve these equations using\nfactorization properties of the corresponding quantum groups. We then give\nthe construction of quantum Lax equations for IRF models and difference\nversions of Calogero-Moser-Sutherland models introduced by Ruijsenaars.\nWe again solve the equations using factorization properties of the underlying\nelliptic quantum groups. So far the construction is quite abstract: we give\na formal solution to the equations of motion and the theory should be further developed by studying explicit quantum factorization in specific models.\n(One can picture Hamilton-Jacobi theory as a useful analog from classical\nmechanics.) We are solving the quantum mechanical time evolution of quantum integrable systems, not the spectrum that is usually studied in quantum\nmechanics. In quantum optics, however, it is exactly the time-evolution that\nis at the center of interest and it would be interesting to see if our work can\ngive some new insights in that field.\n49\n\n\f50\n\nCHAPTER 4. QUANTUM INTEGRABLE SYSTEMS\n\nThe research was done in collaboration with Branislav Jur\u010do and is published in [5, 6]; the remainder of this chapter is based on these publications.\nIn the next section we review the classical theory, giving a more detailed\nintroduction to the problem that we want to solve.\n\n4.1\n\nTwisted quantum Lax equations\n\nWe would like to understand quantum integrable systems related to quasitriangular Hopf algebras in a way that generalizes the classical theory based\non the construction of Adler [64], Kostant [82], Symes [94] for Lie groups\nand its subsequent generalization to the Lie-Poisson case due to SemenovTian-Shansky [90]. The classical theory which we briefly summarize in this\nsection gives the construction and solution of integrable systems possessing a (twisted) Lax pair and r-matrix formulation. The rich structure of\nthese integrable systems appears naturally as a consequence of the factorization properties of the groups under consideration. Within this approach\nthe fundamental methods (inverse scattering method [75], algebro-geometric\nmethods of solution) and the fundamental notions of the soliton theory, such\nas \u03c4 -function [78] and Baker-Akhieser function [70], [89], found their unifying and natural group-theoretical explanation. Here we are interested in the\nquantum case. The theory of integrable models in quantum mechanics and\nquantum field theory made remarkable progress with the quantum version of\nthe inverse scattering method, which goes back to the seminal Bethe ansatz\nfor the solution of the Heisenberg spin chain. We refer the reader for a review of related topics to the books [74], [81] and to the papers [71], [83], [96].\nThis development suggested the introduction of quantum groups [69], [77]\nas algebraic objects that play in the quantum case a role analogous to that\nof Lie groups in the classical theory. However, we were still missing (with\nthe exception of the quantum integrable systems with discrete time evolution\n[85]) a quantum analogue of the factorization theorem for the solution of the\nHeisenberg equations of motion for quantum integrable systems. We have\nalso to mention the remarkable paper [84] in this context.\nThe quantum systems we consider are quantum counterparts of those\ndescribed by the classical factorization theorem. In [80] a quantum version of\nthe theory in the case without twisting was formulated. Our main result, the\nquantum factorization theorem, as well as the remaining discussion extends\nall constructions in the presence of twisting.\n\n\f4.1. TWISTED QUANTUM LAX EQUATIONS\n\n4.1.1\n\n51\n\nClassical integrable systems\n\nHere we briefly review the construction of integrable systems and their solution by factorization which is due to M. Semenov-Tian-Shansky [90] and\nwhich generalizes to the case of the Poisson Lie groups the construction of\nAdler, Kostant and Symes [64], [82], [94]. Let G be a quasitriangular Poisson\nLie group, which is for simplicity assumed to be a matrix group. Let g be the\ncorresponding Lie algebra and r \u2208 g \u2297 g the classical r-matrix, a solution to\nthe classical Yang-Baxter equation. In the following we will use a notation\nthat does not distinguish between the universal element and its matrix representative. We will denote by Gr and g r the dual Poisson Lie group and its\nLie algebra respectively. The pairing between g and g r is denoted by h., .i.\nThe Poisson structure on G is given by the Sklyanin bracket\n{g1 , g2 } = [r, g \u2297 g] .\n\n(4.1)\n\nHere we used the standard tensor notation: g1 = g \u22971, g2 = 1\u2297g, with g \u2208 G\nbeing a group element (matrix) and 1 the unit matrix. The commutator on\nthe right-hand side is the usual matrix commutator in g \u2297 g. With the\nuniversal r-matrix r we can associate two mappings r\u00b1 : g r \u2192 g\nr+ (X) = hX \u2297 id, ri \u2261 X+ ,\n\nr\u2212 (X) = \u2212hid \u2297 X, ri \u2261 X\u2212 .\n\n(4.2)\n\nThese mappings are algebra homomorphism. Let g \u00b1 = Im(r\u00b1 ) be the corresponding subalgebras in g. Consider the combined mapping ir = r\u2212 \u2295 r+ :\ng r \u2192 g \u2295 g. Let us assume that the mapping r+ \u2212 r\u2212 : g r \u2192 g is an isomorphism of linear spaces. In that case g is called factorizable and any X \u2208 g\nhas a unique decomposition\nX = X+ \u2212 X\u2212 ,\n\n(4.3)\n\nwith (X\u2212 , X+ ) \u2208 Im(ir ). The map ir gives rise to a Lie group embedding\nIr : Gr = G\u2212 \u00d7 G+ \u2192 G \u00d7 G. Followed by the group inversion in the\nfirst factor and a subsequent group multiplication of factors it defines a local\nhomeomorphism on the Poisson Lie groups Gr and G. This means that in\nthe neighborhood of the group identity any group element g \u2208 G admits a\nunique decomposition\n\u22121\ng+ ,\n(4.4)\ng = g\u2212\nwith (g\u2212 , g+ ) \u2208 Im(Ir ).\nThe group manifold equipped with Sklyanin bracket (4.1) plays the role of\nthe phase space for a classical dynamical system governed by a Hamiltonian\n\n\f52\n\nCHAPTER 4. QUANTUM INTEGRABLE SYSTEMS\n\nconstructed in the following way. Let \u03c6 by an automorphism of g which\npreserves the classical r-matrix\n(\u03c6 \u2297 \u03c6)r = r\n\n(4.5)\n\nand which defines an automorphism of G denoted by the same symbol. The\nHamiltonian h is taken as any smooth function on G invariant with respect\nto the twisted conjugation. This means that\nh(g) = h(g1\u03c6 g(g1)\u22121 ), g \u03c6 \u2261 \u03c6(g)\n\n(4.6)\n\nholds for any two group elements g, g1 \u2208 G. The functions satisfying (4.6)\nare in involution with respect to the Sklyanin bracket, so they play the role\nof integrals of motion for the dynamical system on G just described above.\nWe shall denote this involutive subset of C \u221e (G) as I \u03c6 (G).\nFor any smooth function f on G let us introduce Df (g) \u2208 g r by the\nfollowing equality\nhDf (g), Xi = (d/dt)t=0 f (getX ).\n(4.7)\nWe shall also use the symbol \u2207f (g) for the corresponding element of g\n\u2207f (g) = (Df (g))+ \u2212 (Df (g))\u2212\n\n(4.8)\n\nand we shall refer to it as to the gradient of f . If h1 , h2 \u2208 I \u03c6 (G) then the\ncorresponding gradients commute.\nNow we can formulate the main classical theorem:\nTheorem 4.1.1 (main classical theorem) (i) Functions h \u2208 I \u03c6 (G)\nare in involution with respect to the Sklyanin bracket on G. (ii) The equations\nof motion defined by Hamiltonians h \u2208 I \u03c6 (G) are of the Lax form\ndL/dt = \u03c6(M \u00b1 )L \u2212 LM \u00b1 ,\n\n(4.9)\n\nwith M \u00b1 = (Dh )(L)\u00b1 and L \u2208 G. (iii) Let g \u00b1 (t) be the solutions to the\nfactorization problem (4.4) with the left hand side given by\ng(t) = exp(t\u2207h (L(0))).\n\n(4.10)\n\nThe integral curves of equation (4.9) are given by\nL(t) = \u03c6(g\u00b1 (t))L(0)g\u00b1 (t)\u22121 .\n\n(4.11)\n\n\f4.1. TWISTED QUANTUM LAX EQUATIONS\n\n53\n\nAn elegant proof of this theorem as presented by N.Y. Reshetikhin in\nlectures at the University of Munich is given in appendix B. Interested\nreaders can also consult [90], [87] for other proofs. We would like to mention\nthat there is an easy direct proof and a more conceptual one, which reflects\nthe rich structure of the theory of Poisson Lie groups and the geometry\nrelated to the theory of integrable systems. The strategy of the second proof\nis to show that the Lax equations are obtained by a change of variables from\nthe simplest G\u2212 \u00d7G+ -invariant Hamiltonian systems on the so-called classical\nHeisenberg double (the Poisson Lie generalization of the of the cotangent\nbundle T \u2217 (G)). This construction allows also, using the Poisson Lie variant\nof the symplectic reduction, to give one more description of the symplectic\nleaves of G which are known to be the orbits of the dressing action of Gr on\nG [90].\nIt is often useful to consider the Lax equations (4.9) corresponding to\ndifferent Hamiltonians from I \u03c6 (G) simultaneously, using different time parameters corresponding to the different Hamiltonians. Usually there is given\na hierarchy (a complete set) of functionally independent Hamiltonians h\u03b1 ,\nwith \u03b1 running over some label set I. The corresponding time parameters\nare {t\u03b1 }\u03b1\u2208I \u2261 t and we index by \u03b1 also the corresponding gradients and\nmatrices M \u00b1 entering the Lax equations. Then we obtain the following\nequations for L(t) \u2208 G, M\u03b1\u00b1 (t) \u2208 g and M\u03b1 \u2261 \u2207h\u03b1 \u2208 g\n\u2202L/\u2202t\u03b1 = \u03c6(M\u03b1\u00b1 )L \u2212 LM\u03b1\u00b1 ,\n\n(4.12)\n\n\u2202M\u03b1 /\u2202t\u03b2 = [M\u03b2\u00b1 , M\u03b1 ]\n\n(4.13)\n\n\u2202M\u03b1\u00b1 /\u2202t\u03b2 \u2212 \u2202M\u03b2\u00b1 /\u2202t\u03b1 = [M\u03b2\u00b1 , M\u03b1\u00b1 ].\n\n(4.14)\n\nand\nHere the integral curves L(t) corresponding to the commuting dynamical\nflows on G are given as above by the twisted conjugation like in (4.11) with\nthe factors of\nX\ng(t) = exp(\nt\u03b1 M\u03b1 (0)).\n(4.15)\n\u03b1\n\nIn the case of a concrete dynamical system, we pick up a proper symplectic\nleaf on G. Usually it is taken in a way that I \u03c6 (G) contains enough first integrals to ensure that the system is completely integrable (in a proper sense).\nThe group element g(t) can then be brought by a similarity transformation\nto the form\nX\ng(t) = \u03c6(0)exp(\nt\u03b1 X\u03b1 )\u03c6(0)\u22121 ,\n(4.16)\nwhere X\u03b1 are generators of some abelian subalgebra of G, so that the group\nelement g(t) describes an embedding of one of the commutative subgroups\nof G into G itself.\n\n\f54\n\nCHAPTER 4. QUANTUM INTEGRABLE SYSTEMS\n\nLet us now consider the quantization of the Lie-Poisson structure. The\nreader is referred to the existing monographs on quantum groups (e.g. [67])\nfor the necessary information on quantum groups.\n\n4.1.2\n\nHeisenberg equations of motion\n\nAs quantized phase space we take the non-commutative Hopf algebra F of\nfunctions on a quantum group, dual via the pairing h., .i : U \u2297 F \u2192 k to a\nquasitriangular Hopf algebra U. The quantum analog of Sklyanin's bracket\nis then [72]\nRT1 T2 = T2 T1 R.\n(4.17)\nThe R-matrix can be expanded as R = 1 + hr + O(h2 ), where h is a deformation parameter that gives the correspondence to classical mechanics:\n[f, g]\n= {f, g} (mod h),\nh\nsuch that for instance 0 = RT1 T2 \u2212 T2 T1 R = [T1 , T2 ] (mod h) and\n0=\n\nRT1 T2 \u2212 T2 T1 R\n= {T1 , T2 } \u2212 [T1 T2 , r] (mod h),\nh\n\ni.e. {T1 , T2 } = [T1 T2 , r] is the classical limit of (4.17) as desired. (Note that\n(locally) all integrable systems have such a classical r-matrix [66]).\nIn these and the following expressions T may either be interpreted simply\nas a Matrix T \u2208 Mn (F ) or, much more general, as the canonical element of\nU \u2297 F : Let {ei } and {f i } be dual linear bases of U and F respectively. It\nis very convenient to work with the canonical element in U \u2297 F (also called\nthe universal T -matrix [72], for an elementary overview see [68]),\nX\nT =\nei \u2297 f i \u2208 U \u2297 F,\n(4.18)\ni\n\nbecause equations expressed in terms of it will be reminiscent of the familiar\nexpressions for matrix representation-but we still keep full Hopf algebraic\ngenerality. For the same reason we will often write \"T1 \" in place of \"T12 \" when\nwe use a notation that suppresses direct reference to the second tensor space\nof T ; multiplication in F is understood in that case. Example: R12 T1 T2 =\nT2 T1 R12 is short for R12 T13 T23 = T23 T13 R12 .\nThe set of cocommutative elements of F form a commutative subalgebra\nI \u2282 F [69]. If we choose a Hamiltonian from this set, it will commute\nwith all other cocommutative elements, which will consequently be constants\nof motion. This observation can be generalized to twisted cocommutative\n\n\f4.1. TWISTED QUANTUM LAX EQUATIONS\n\n55\n\nelements: Let \u03c6 be an automorphism of U that preserves the universal Rmatrix,\n(\u03c6 \u2297 \u03c6)(R) = R.\n(4.19)\n(\u03c6 is the quantum analog of an automorphism of a Poisson-Lie Group.) Let\n\u03c6\u2217 be the pullback of \u03c6 to F , i.e. hx, \u03c6\u2217 (f )i = h\u03c6(x), f i. The Hamiltonian\nh \u2208 F shall be a twisted cocommutative function,1 i.e.\n\u2206\u2032 h = (\u03c6\u2217 \u2297 id)(\u2206h),\n\n(4.20)\n\nwhere \u2206\u2032 = \u03c4 \u25e6 \u2206 is the opposite comultiplication. The set of twisted cocommutative functions also form a commutative subalgebra I \u03c6 \u2282 F .\nIn the following we shall present the more general twisted case. The\nuntwisted formulation can be obtained by omitting \"\u03c6\" in all expressions.\nThe dynamics of our system is governed by the Heisenberg equations of\nmotion\nif \u0307 = [h, f ], \u2200f \u2208 F.\n(4.21)\nThese can equivalently be written in terms of the universal T as\nX\ni\u1e6a \u2261 i\nei \u2297 f \u0307i = [id \u2297 h, T ] = hT13 T23 \u2212 T23 T13 , h \u2297 id2 i,\nor short\n\ni\u1e6a2 = h[T1 , T2 ], h \u2297 idi.\n\n(4.22)\n\nStrategy for solution\nOur strategy to solve equation (4.22) will be to embed the quantized phasespace F into a bigger algebra (the Heisenberg double, DH \u2248 F \u2297U as a vector\nspace), where the equations take on a particularly simple form: The image\nunder this embedding of a Hamiltonian h \u2208 I \u03c6 is a casimir in U which leads\nto trivial time evolution in U \u2282 DH and simple (linear) evolution in DH , see\nfigure 4.1. Projecting the solution back to F we will find that Heisenberg's\nequations can be written in (twisted) Lax form and our original problem is\nsolved by factorization just like in the classical case.\n\n4.1.3\n\nHeisenberg double with twist\n\nThe Heisenberg Double of F shall refer to the the semi-direct product algebra DH = F \u00d7U [95, 65, 91]. It is also known as the quantum algebra of\ndifferential operators [98, 88] or the quantum cotangent bundle on F ; see e.g.\n1\n\nQuantum traces are twisted cocommutative functions with a non-trivial \u03c6 given by\nthe square of the antipode, while ordinary traces are simply cocommutative.\n\n\f56\n\nCHAPTER 4. QUANTUM INTEGRABLE SYSTEMS\n\nDH\n\nU\n\nF\n\nFigure 4.1: Nonlinear evolution with Hamiltonian h \u2208 F becomes linear after\na nontrivial embeding of F into the Heisenberg double DH with h 7\u2192 h\u0303. This\nis due to the constant evolution that h\u0303 generates in the dual to F , U \u2282 DH .\n[73] for the corresponding classical Heisenberg double. DH is isomorphic to\nF \u2297 U as a vector space; it inherits the product structures of F and U; mixed\nproducts are obtained from the left action of U on F . All relations can be\nconveniently summarized in terms of the canonical element T of F \u2297 U [68]:\nT23 T12 = T12 T13 T23 .\n\n(Heisenberg Double)\n\n(4.23)\n\nThis equation gives commutation relations for elements x \u2208 U with elements\nf \u2208 F that equip F \u2297U with an algebra structure: x*f = hid \u2297\u2206x, \u2206f \u2297 idi \u2208\nF \u2297 U. In the setting of interest to us, F is a co-quasitriangular Hopf algebra\nwho's structure (4.17) is determined by a universal R-matrix. Following\nDrinfel'd's construction [69] we shall assume that U is itself the quantum\ndouble of a Hopf algebra U+ ; the universal R arises then as the canonical\nelement in U\u2212 \u2297 U+ , where U\u2212 = U+\u2217op\u2206 . The Yang-Baxter equation\nR23 R13 R12 = R12 R13 R23\n\n(Quantum Double)\n\n(4.24)\n\nplays the same role for the quantum double U = U+ \u2736 U\u2212 as (4.23) plays\nfor the Heisenberg Double. The spaces U+ and U\u2212 are images of the two\nmappings R\u00b1 : F \u2192 U\u00b1 associated with the universal R \u2208 U\u2212 \u2297 U+ :\nR+ (f ) = hR21 , id \u2297 f i,\n\n\u22121\nR\u2212 (f ) = hR12\n, id \u2297 f i.\n\n(4.25)\n\nThe twisted Heisenberg double was introduced in [91]. The most convenient description for our purposes of the dual Hopf algebra U with twist is\nin terms of the universal invertible twisted-invariant 2-tensor Y \u2208 U \u2297 U:\n\u03c6\n\u03c6\nY1 R12\nY2 R21 = R12 Y2 R21\nY1 .\n\n(4.26)\n\n\f57\n\n4.1.

(In the case of a trivial\ntwist \u03c6 = id we may chose Y = R21 R12 ; equation (4.26) is then a consequence\nof the Yang-Baxter equation (4.24).)\nCrucial for the construction that we are going to present is that T factorizes in U \u2297 F as [72]\nT = \u039bZ,\n\nwith \u039b \u2208 U\u2212 \u2297 F\u2212 ,\n\nZ \u2208 U+ \u2297 F+ ,\n\nF\u00b1 = (U\u00b1 )\u2217 .\n\n(4.29)\n\nWe have U = U\u2212 \u2297 U+ as a linear space and coalgebra and F = F\u2212 \u2297 F+ as\na linear space and algebra:\n(\u2206 \u2297 id)(\u039b) = \u039b1 \u039b2 ,\n\n(\u2206 \u2297 id)(Z) = Z1 Z2 ,\n\n\u039b 1 Z2 = Z2 \u039b 1 .\n\n(4.30)\n\nThe universal elements Z and \u039b of U\u00b1 \u2297 F\u00b1 define projections F \u2192 F\u00b1\nand U \u2192 U\u00b1 that can be used to extract the F\u00b1 parts of any element of\nF and the U\u00b1 parts of (\u2212+)-ordered expressions in U. Let us denote by\n(L+ )\u22121 \u2208 U \u2297 U+ and L\u2212 \u2208 U \u2297 U\u2212 the corresponding images of Y \u22121 , such\nthat Y = L+ (L\u2212 )\u22121 .

QUANTUM INTEGRABLE SYSTEMS\n\nRemark: Similar relations involving R, L\u00b1 and T in the presence of twisting were proposed in [91]. Further relations involving Y and T can be easily\nobtained from the ones given above. The apparent asymmetry between relations involving Z versus those involving \u039b is due to our choice of factorizing T\nas \u039bZ. We could have also based our analysis on T = SV with S \u2208 U+ \u2297 F+\nand V \u2208 U\u2212 \u2297 F\u2212 ; this would restore the +/\u2212-symmetry.\nProof: We shall only proof relation (4.31) that we are going to use extensively in the next sections. (The other relations follow similarly; see also [80]\nand the discussion in [79].)\nThe second tensor space of relation (4.28) is not (U\u2212 U+ )-ordered so we have\nto resort to a trick: with the help of (4.17) we can derive a new relation\nT1 Y1 T\n\n2\n\n\u2212+\n\n= R 2 1T\n\u2212\n\n2\n\n\u2212+\n\nT1 Y1 R\u03c6 1 2\n\n+\n\nwhose second tensor space is (U\u2212 U+ )-ordered as is easily verified. Projecting\n\u03c6\nto U+ we obtain T1 Y1 Z2 = Z2 T1 Y1 R12\nwhich can be simplified using T1 =\n\u039b1 Z1 and \u039b1 Z2 = Z2 \u039b1 to yield (4.31).\n\u2737\nA remark on quantum traces and twisting\nWe have argued that the cocommutative elements of F are natural candidates\nfor Hamiltonians. Classically cocommutativity is equivalent to ad-invariance,\nso it would also be natural to look for Hamiltonian functions in the quantum\ncase that are invariant under the quantum adjoint coaction2\n\u2206Ad (h) \u2261 h(2) \u2297 S(h(1) )h(3) = h \u2297 1,\n\n(4.42)\n\nIt turns out that both these and the cocommutative Hamiltonians are treated\non equal footing in the twisted formulation: Requirement (4.42) is equivalent\nto\n\u2206h = (id \u2297 S 2 )(\u2206\u2032 h),\n(4.43)\ni.e. corresponds to a twisted cocommutative function with the pullback of\nthe twist \u03c6\u2217 given by the square of the antipode. The twist \u03c6 = S 2 is here\ngenerated via conjugation by an element u \u2208 U:\nS 2 (x) = uxu\u22121 ,\n\n\u2200x \u2208 U.\n\n(4.44)\n\nIt seems interesting to study the general case of a twist \u03c6 that is given via\nconjugation by some element \u03c6, i.e.\n\u03c6(x) = \u03c6x\u03c6\u22121 ,\n2\n\n(\u03c6 \u2297 \u03c6)R = R(\u03c6 \u2297 \u03c6).\n\nThis holds for instance for quantum traces.\n\n(4.45)\n\n\f59\n\n4.1. TWISTED QUANTUM LAX EQUATIONS\n\nIf \u03c6 \u2208 U then \u03c6\u2217 (f ) = h\u03c6, f(1) if(2) h\u03c6\u22121 , f(3) i for all f \u2208 F . (Here we see by\nthe way that \u03c6\u2217 (h) = h holds both for cocommutative and twisted cocommutative h.) Due to (4.45), f 7\u2192 hid \u2297 \u03c6\u22121 , \u2206f i defines an algebra isomorphism\nof F , that maps I \u2282 F to I \u03c6 \u2282 F , i.e. cocommutative elements to twisted\ncocommutative elements.\nIt is easily verified that all expressions containing \u03c6, e.g. (4.26), (4.31),\netc. continue to hold if we omit \u03c6 and replace Y by Y * (\u03c6 \u2297 1). Examples:\nR21 Y1 \u03c61 R12 Y2 \u03c62 = Y2 \u03c62 R21 Y1 \u03c61 R12 ,\nZ1 Y1 \u03c61 Z2 = Z2 Z1 Y1 \u03c61 R12 ,\n\netc.\n\n(4.46)\n(4.47)\n\nThis gives a nice mnemonic for where to put the \u03c6's-even when an element\n\u03c6 does not exist in U: First we write expressions without \u03c6, then we formally\nreplace all (L\u2212 )\u22121 's by (L\u2212 )\u22121 * (\u03c6 \u2297 1) (and consequently Y by Y * (\u03c6 \u2297 1)),\nfinally we remove all \u03c6's from the expression with the help of relation (4.45).\nRemark: Y = L+ (L\u2212 )\u22121 but Y 6= R21 R12 in the twisted case. In case we\nknow an element \u03c6 that satisfies (4.45), we can realize L\u00b1 in terms of the\n\u22121\nuniversal R for instance as L+ = R21 and L\u2212 = \u03c61 R12\n. There is however\nsome remaining ambiguity in this choice.\n\n4.1.4\n\nEmbedding the operator algebra into the double\n\nHere we will show how to embed F into DH in such a way that any (twisted)\ncocommutative element of F is mapped to a casimir operator of U \u2282 DH .\nProposition 4.1.3 The following element of U \u2297 DH\nTe = \u03c6(Z)Y \u22121 Z \u22121 ,\n\n(4.48)\n\nR12 Te1 Te2 = Te1 Te2 R12\n\n(4.49)\n\nwhere \u03c6(Z) \u2261 (\u03c6 \u2297 id)(Z), satisfies\n\nand thus defines an embedding of F \u0592\u2192 DH : f 7\u2192 hTe, f \u2297 idi, that is an\nalgebra homomorphism.

Another closely related\ngeneralization of quantum groups, the so-called elliptic quantum groups, were\nintroduced by Felder [100] in the context of IRF (face) models [101]. Face\n\n\f68\n\nCHAPTER 4. QUANTUM INTEGRABLE SYSTEMS\n\nHopf algebras and elliptic quantum groups play the same role for face models\nas quantum groups do for vertex models. The R-matrices are now replaced by\ndynamical R-matrices, which first appeared in the context of Liouville string\nfield theory [102]; they can be understood as a reformulation of the Boltzmann weights in Baxters solutions of the face-type Yang-Baxter equation. A\npartial classification of the dynamical R-matrices is given in [103]. Recently\nanother type of integrable quantum systems, known as Ruijsenaars models [104], and their various limiting cases have been shown to be connected\nto quantum groups and elliptic quantum groups [105, 106, 107, 108, 109]\nthrough different approaches.\nThe Calogero-Moser-Sutherland class of integrable models describe the\nmotion of particles on a one-dimensional line or circle interacting via pairwise\npotentials that are given by Weierstrass elliptic functions and their various\ndegenerations. The simplest case is an inverse r 2 potential. The RuijsenaarsSchneider model is a relativistic generalization, whose quantum mechanical\nversion, the Ruijsenaars model, is the model that we are interested in here.\nThe Hamiltonian of the Ruijsenaars model for two particles with coordinates x1 and x2 has the form\n\u001a c\u03b7\n\u001b\n+ \u03bb) (\u03bb)\n\u03b8( 2 \u2212 \u03bb) (\u03bb) \u03b8( c\u03b7\n2\nH=\nt +\nt\n,\n\u03b8(\u2212\u03bb) 1\n\u03b8(\u03bb) 2\nwhere \u03bb = x1 \u2212 x2 . Here c \u2208 C is the coupling constant, \u03b7 is the relativistic\ndeformation parameter, the \u03b8-function is given in (4.107); we have set ~ = 1.\nThe Hamiltonian acts on a wave function as\nH \u03c8(\u03bb) =\n\n\u03b8( c\u03b7 + \u03bb)\n\u03b8( c\u03b7\n\u2212 \u03bb)\n2\n\u03c8(\u03bb \u2212 \u03b7) + 2\n\u03c8(\u03bb + \u03b7),\n\u03b8(\u2212\u03bb)\n\u03b8(\u03bb)\n\n(\u03bb)\n\nthe ti that appear in the Hamiltonian are hence shift-operators in the variable \u03bb; in the present case of two particles they generate a one-dimensional\ngraph:\nr\n\nr \u271b t2\n\n\u00d7r\n\u03bb\n\nt1 \u2732 r\n\nr\n\nRelative to a fixed vertex \u03bb the vertices of this graph are at points \u03b7 * Z \u2208 R,\nthe (ordered) paths connect neighboring vertices and are hence intervals in R.\nThere are two paths per interval, one in positive, one in negative direction.\nNow consider a N-particle Ruijsenaars model: The graph relative to a\nfixed \u03bb is then a N \u2212 1 dimensional hyper-cubic lattice. Relative to \u03bb \u2208\nRN \u22121 the vertices are at points (\u03b7 * Z)\u00d7(N \u22121) . This picture can obviously be\ngeneralized and in the following we shall consider an arbitrary ordered graph.\n\n\f4.2. FACE ALGEBRAS AND RUIJSENAARS MODELS\n\n69\n\nRemark: For the Ruijsenaars system \u03bb can take any value in RN \u22121 , so we\nare a priori let to a huge graph that consists of a continuous family of disconnected graphs. Since the graphs are disconnected it is sufficient to consider\none. Later we will in fact write all expressions with respect to one fixed\nvertex \u03bb. This will lead to equations containing explicit shifts on the graph\nand thus to dynamical R-matrices. Apart from the physical interpretation\nthere is a priori no reason to restrict the values of particle-coordinates at the\nlevel of the shift operator to R. We can and shall everywhere in the following\ntake C instead of R.\n\n4.2.1\n\nFace Hopf algebras\n\nThe Hilbert space of the model will be build from vector spaces on paths of\nfixed length. As we shall argue in the following, the operators on this Hilbert\nspace can be chosen to be elements of a Face Algebra F [99] (or weak C \u2217 -Hopf\nalgebras [110, 111], which is essentially the same with a \u2217-structure).\nThere are two commuting projection operators ei , ei \u2208 F for each vertex\nof the graph (projectors onto bra's and ket's corresponding to vertex i):\nP\nP\nei ej = \u03b4ij ei , ei ej = \u03b4ij ei ,\nei = ei = 1.\n(4.81)\nF shall be equipped with a coalgebra structure such that the combination\neij \u2261 ei ej = ej ei is a corepresentation:\n\u2206(eij ) =\n\nP\n\ni\nk ek\n\n\u2297 ekj ,\n\n\u01eb(eij ) = \u03b4ij .\n\n(4.82)\n\nP\nIt follows that \u2206(1) = k ek \u2297 ek 6= 1 \u2297 1 (unless the graph has only a single\nvertex) \u2013 this is a key feature of face algebras (and weak C \u2217 -Hopf algebras).\nSo far we have considered matrices with indices that are vertices, i.e.\npaths of length zero. In the given setting it is natural to also allow paths of\nfixed length on a finite oriented graph G as matrix indices. This is illustrated\nin figure 4.2. We shall use capital letters to label paths. A path P has an\norigin (source) *P , an end (range) P * and a length #P . Two paths Q, P\ncan be concatenated to form a new path Q * P , if the end of the first path\ncoincides with the start of the second path, i.e. if Q* = *P (this explains our\nchoice of notation).\nThe important point is, that the symbols TBA , where #A = #B \u2265 0, with\nrelations\n\u0001 X A\n\u2032\nTA\u2032 \u2297 TBA (#A = #A\u2032 = #B)\n(4.83)\n\u2206 TBA =\nA\u2032\n\n\u01eb(TBA ) = \u03b4AB\n\n(4.84)\n\n\f70\n\nCHAPTER 4.

Inner paths are summed over.\nOften it is convenient not to consider a particular representation, i.e. T matrices corresponding to paths of a given fixed length but rather an abstract,\nuniversal T . Heuristically one can think of the universal T as an abstract\nmatrix or group element, but it does in fact simply provide an alternative\nto the usual Hopf algebra notation: T , T1 \u2297 T1 , T1 T2 , e.g. correspond to\nthe identity map, coproduct map and multiplication map of F respectively.\n(More details are given in the appendix.) Keeping this in mind we shall-\nwithout loss of generality-nethertheless use a formal notation that treats T\nas if it was the canonical element T12 of U \u2297 F , where U is the dual of F via\nthe pairing h , i.4\n4\n\nhT, f i = f,\n\nhT1 \u2297 T1 , f i = \u2206 f,\n\nhT1 T2 , f \u2297 gi = f g;\n\nf, g \u2208 F\n\nHere and in the following we shall frequently suppress the the second index of T ; it\ncorresponds to the F -space. The displayed expressions are short for hT12 , f \u2297 idi = f \u2208 F ,\nhT12 T13 , f \u2297 id \u2297 idi = \u2206 f \u2208 F \u2297 F and hT13 T23 , f \u2297 g \u2297 idi = f g \u2208 F .\n\n\f4.2. FACE ALGEBRAS AND RUIJSENAARS MODELS\n\n71\n\nA face Hopf algebra has an anti-algebra and anti-coalgebra endomorphism, called the antipode and denoted by S or-in the universal tensor\nformalism-by T\u0303 : hT\u0303 , f i = S(f ). The antipode satisfies some compatibility\nconditions with the coproduct that are given in the appendix.\nRemark: In the limit of a graph with a single vertex a face Hopf algebra is\nthe same as a Hopf algebra. Ordinary matrix indices correspond to closed\nloops in that case.\nUniversal-T formalism\nFor many reasons it is very convenient to use a formalism based on the\nso-called universal T . The expressions formally resemble those in a matrix\nrepresentation but give nevertheless general face Hopf algebra statements.\nThis greatly simplifies notation but also the interpretation and application\nof the resulting expressions. When we are dealing with quantizations of the\nfunctions on a group we need to keep track both of the non-commutativity\nof the quantized functions and the residue of the underlying group structure.\nBoth these structures can be encoded in algebraic relations for the universal\nT which easily allows to control two non-commutative structures. In fact T\ncan be regarded as a universal group element. Universal tensor expressions\ncan formally be read in two ways: Either as \"group\" operations (or rather\noperations in U) or as the corresponding pull-back maps in the dual space.\nThis simplifies the heuristics of \"dualizing and reversing arrows\" and allows\nus to keep track of the classical limit. Example: Multiplication in U, x\u2297y 7\u2192\nxy: The corresponding pull-back map in the dual space F is the coproduct\n\u2206. Both operations are summarized in the same universal expression T12 T13 .\nSometimes T can be realized as the canonical element U \u2297 F , but we\ndo not need to limit ourselves to these cases an will instead define T as the\nidentity map from F to itself and will use the same symbol for the identity\nmap U \u2192 U.\nFor the application of this identity map to an element of F we shall\nnevertheless use the same bracket notation as we would for a true canonical\nelement in the finite case, i.e. f \u2261 hid, f i = hT12 , f \u2297 idi. This notation is\nvery convenient-like inserting the unity in quantum mechanics. The identity\nmap on a product is given by ab 7\u2192 a * b or\nhT12 , ab \u2297 idi = hT13 T23 , a \u2297 b \u2297 idi = a * b\nWe shall write \u22061 T12 = T13 T23 to express this fact-this is hence the universal-T notation for the multiplication map in F (and the coproduct map in\n\n\f72\n\nCHAPTER 4. QUANTUM INTEGRABLE SYSTEMS\n\nU). The coproduct map in F (multiplication map in U) is T12 T13 :\nf 7\u2192 hT12 T13 , f \u2297 id \u2297 idi = \u2206(f )\nThe antipode map is T\u0303 : f 7\u2192 S(f ), the contraction map x \u2297 1 with x \u2208 U =\nF \u2217 maps f \u2208 F to 1hx, f i, the counit map is 1 \u2297 1, etc.. For face\nP algebras\nthe counit is P\nnot an algebra homomorphism but rather \u22061F = k ek \u2297 ek\nk\nk\nk\nand \u22061U =\nk \u2297 E , where hEk , f i = \u01eb(f ek ) and hE , f i = \u01eb(e f ).\nk EP\nTherefore \u01eb(ab) = k \u01eb(aek )\u01eb(ek b). This is one of the face algebra axioms. It\ndiffers from the corresponding ordinary Hopf algebra axiom (there: \u01eb(ab) =\n\u01eb(a)\u01eb(b)). Some important relations involving the coproduct and antipode\nmaps are\nX\nX\nE i \u2297 ei , T\u0303 T T\u0303 = T\u0303 , T T\u0303 T = T.\nT\u0303 T =\nEi \u2297 ei , T T\u0303 =\ni\n\ni\n\nIn the pictorial representation this relations imply that the vertices of the\npaths in U and F that form T match to give a closed \"square\".

The axioms [99] for a quasitriangular\nface algebra are similar to those of a quasitriangular Hopf algebra; there is a\nuniversal R \u2208 U \u2297U that controls the non-cocommutativity of the coproduct\nin U and the non-commutativity of the product in F ,\nRT1 T2 = T2 T1 R,\n\nR\u0303T2 T1 = T1 T2 R\u0303,\n\nR\u0303 \u2261 (S \u2297 id)(R),\n\n(4.86)\n\nhowever the antipode of R is no longer inverse of R but rather\nR\u0303R = \u2206(1),\n\nRR\u0303 = \u2206\u2032 (1).\n\n(4.87)\n\nThe numerical \"R-matrix\" obtained by contracting R with two face corepresentations is given by the face Boltzmann weight W :\nAC\nhR, TBA \u2297 TDC i = RBD\n\n\u0010 B \u0011\n\u2261 W C D\nA\n\nB\n\u2732\n\n\u223c\n\nC\u2744\n\n\u2732\n\nA\n\n\u2744\nD\n\n\f73\n\n4.2.

Moving along the outer\nedges of the hexagon we will later read of the shifts in the Yang-Baxter\nequation for dynamical R-matrices.\nSo far we have argued heuristically that the Ruijsenaars system naturally\nleads to graphs and face algebras. The formal relation between face Hopf\nalgebras and oriented graphs it is established by a lemma of Hayashi (Lemma\n3.1 of [112]) which says that any right or left comodule M of a face Hopf\nalgebra F decomposes as a linear space to a direct sum M = \u2295i,j Mij with\nindices i, j running over all vertices. So we can naturally associate paths\nfrom j to i to any pair of indices such that Mij 6= \u2205. So we may and in fact\n\n\f74\n\nCHAPTER 4. QUANTUM INTEGRABLE SYSTEMS\n\nwill speak of the vectors of a comodule or a module as of paths. As the dual\nobject U to a face Hopf algebra is again a face Hopf algebra characterized\nby the same set of vertices [112], the same applies to its comodules. It is\nconvenient to choose the orientation of paths appearing in the decomposition\nof a comodule of U (and hence in the module of F ) opposite to the convention\nthat one uses in the case of F .\nParticularly we have for any matrix corepresentation TBA of F with symbols A, B used to label some linear basis in M, the linear span hTBA i of all\nTBA decomposes as linear space (bicomodule of the face Hopf algebra) as a\ndirect sum\nM\nhei ej TBA ek el i = hTBA i\ni,j,k,l\n\ni.e. a sum over paths with fixed starting and ending vertices. The upper\nindices i and k fix the beginning and the end of the path A and the lower\nindices j and l fix the beginning and the end of the path B.\nLet us assume that the matrix elements TBA of a corepresentation of F\nact in a module of paths that we shall label by greek characters \u03b1, \u03b2, etc.\nThe definition of the dual face Hopf algebra implies that the matrix element\n(TBA )\u03b1\u03b2 is nonzero only if *\u03b1 = *B, *A = \u03b1*, B* = *\u03b2 and A* = \u03b2*, i.e. if\npaths \u03b1 * A and B * \u03b2 have common starting and endpoints. This justifies\nthe pictorial representation used in this chapter. It also follows immediately\nthat in the\u0010 case\u0011of a coquasitriangular Face Hopf algebra hR, TBA \u2297 TDC i =\nAC\nRBD\n\u2261 W CB\nD is zero unless *C = *B, B* = *D, C* = *A and A* = D*.\nA\nTo make a contact with the Ruijsenaars type of models, we have to assume\nthat the (coquasitriangular) face Hopf algebra F is generated by the matrix\nelements of some fundamental corepresentation of it. We shall postulate the\npaths of the corresponding corepresentation to be of length 1. The paths\nbelonging to the n-fold tensor product of the fundamental corepresentation\nare then by definition of length n. Taking an infinite tensor product of the\nfundamental corepresentation we get a graph that corresponds to the one\ngenerated by the shift operators of the related integrable model.\nIn the next section we are going to formulate a quantum version of the\nso-called Main Theorem which gives the solution by factorization of the\nHeisenberg equations of motion. For this construction F needs to have a\ncoquasitriangular structure \u2013 this will also fix its algebra structure.\n\n4.2.3\n\nQuantum factorization\n\nThe cocommutative functions in F are of particular interest to us since they\nform a set of mutually commutative operators. We shall pick a Hamiltonian\n\n\f75\n\n4.2. FACE ALGEBRAS AND RUIJSENAARS MODELS\n\nfrom this set. Cocommutative means that the result of an application of\ncomultiplication \u2206 is invariant under exchange of the two resulting factors.\nThe typical example is a trace of the T-matrix. The following theorem gives\nfor the case of face Hopf algebras what has become known as the \"Main\ntheorem\" for the solution by factorization of the equations of motion [113,\n114, 115, 116, 117]. The following theorem is a direct generalization of our\nprevious results for Hopf algebras/Quantum Groups [80, 5]:\nTheorem 4.2.1 (Main theorem for face algebras)\n(i) The set of cocommutative functions, denoted I, is a commutative subalgebra of F .\n(ii) The Heisenberg equations of motion defined by a Hamiltonian H \u2208 I\nare of Lax form\n\u0002\n\u0003\ndT\ni\n= M \u00b1, T ,\n(4.90)\ndt\nwith M \u00b1 = 1 \u2297 H \u2212 m\u00b1 \u2208 U\u00b1 \u2297 F , m\u00b1 = R\u00b1 (H(2) ) \u2297 H(1) ; see (4.88).\n(iii) Let g\u00b1 (t) \u2208 U\u00b1 \u2297 F be the solutions to the factorization problem\n\u22121\ng\u2212\n(t)g+ (t) = exp(it(m+ \u2212 m\u2212 )) \u2208 U \u2297 F,\n\n(4.91)\n\nT (t) = g\u00b1 (t)T (0)g\u00b1 (t)\u22121\n\n(4.92)\n\nthen\nsolves the Lax equation (4.90); g\u00b1 (t) are given by\ng\u00b1 (t) = exp(\u2212it(1 \u2297 h)) exp(it(1 \u2297 h \u2212 M \u00b1 (0))\n\n(4.93)\n\nand are the solutions to the differential equation\ni\n\nd\ng\u00b1 (t) = M \u00b1 (t)g\u00b1 (t),\ndt\n\ng\u00b1 (0) = 1.\n\n(4.94)\n\nProof: The proof is similar to the one given in [5] for factorizable quasitriangular Hopf algebras.

In this section we want to\nwrite expressions with respect to one fixed vertex. Like we mentioned in the\nintroduction we are particularly interested in the action of the Hamiltonian\nwith respect to a fixed vertex. Since the Hamiltonian is an element of F , we\nshall initially fix the vertex in this space; due to the definition of the dual\nface Hopf algebra U this will also fix a corresponding vertex in that space.\nWe shall proceed as follows: We will fix a vertex in the T -matrix with the\nhelp of e\u03bb , e\u03bb \u2208 F and will also introduce the corresponding universal T (\u03bb).\nNext we will contstruct dynamical R-matrices R\u00b1 (\u03bb) as R\u00b1 (T (\u03bb)) \u2013 this is an\nalgebra homomorphism \u2013 and will give the Yang-Baxter and RT T equations\nwith shifts as an illustration.

In the case of\nthe Ruijsenaars model it can be chosen to be the trace of a T -matrix, i.e.\n(\u03c1)\nthe U-trace of T in an appropriate representation \u03c1: H = tr1 T1 . This can\nbe written as a sum over vertices \u03bb of operators that act in the respective\nsubspaces corresponding to paths ending in the vertex \u03bb:\nX\nX\nH=\nTQQ =\nH(\u03bb)\n(4.105)\nQ,#Q fixed\n\n\u03bb\n\nP\nwith H(\u03bb) = He\u03bb =\nT (\u03bb)Q\nQ . The pictorial representation of the Hamiltonian is two closed dashed paths (F -space) connected by paths Q of fixed\nlength that are summed over. In H(\u03bb) the end of path Q is fixed. When we\nlook at a representation on Hilbert space the paths Q with endpoint \u03bb that\nappear in the component H(\u03bb) of the Hamiltonian H will shift the argument\nof a state \u03c8(\u03bb) corresponding to the vertex \u03bb to a new vertex corresponding\nto the starting point of the path Q. In the next section we will see in detail\nhow this construction is applied to the Ruijsenaars system. For this we will\nhave to take a representation of the face Hopf algebra F . We shall then\ndenote the resulting Lax operator by L. The Hamiltonian will contain a sum\n(coming from the trace) over shift operators.\n\n\f4.2. FACE ALGEBRAS AND RUIJSENAARS MODELS\n\n79\n\nFor the Lax operators it is convenient to fix two vertices \u03bb and \u03bc corresponding to paths from \u03bc to \u03bb . (We did not need to do this for the\nHamiltonian since it acts only on closed paths.) The T that appears in the\nLax equation (4.90) becomes\nT12 (\u03bb, \u03bc) = T12 (e\u03bc e\u03bb )2 = (E\u03bb )1 T12 (E\u03bc )1 ;\nit should be taken in some representation of F on the appropriate Hilbert\nspace. On space U we are interested in a finite-dimensional representation\nthat is going to give us matrices. Both is done in the next section and we\nshall call the resulting operator L(\u03bb, \u03bc). Similarly we proceed with the other\ntwo Lax operators M \u00b1 :\nM \u00b1 (\u03bb, \u03bc) \u2261 (E\u03bb \u2297 1)M \u00b1 (E\u03bc \u2297 1) = E\u03bb \u03b4\u03bb,\u03bc \u2297 H \u2212 m\u00b1 (\u03bb, \u03bc).\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n(Recall that E\u03bb E\u03bc = E\u03bb \u03b4\u03bb,\u03bc .)

If the Hamiltonian is a trace we shall find a sum over shifts.\n\nRemark: There is another possible choice of conventions for the fixed vertex.\nWe could worked with T12 {\u03bd} = (e\u03bd )2 T12 instead of T12 (\u03bb) = T12 (e\u03bb )2 . This\nwould have fixed the lower left vertex in the pictorial representation of TBA\nand the vertex that is starting-point for all paths in R{\u03bd}. The dynamical\nequations would of course look a little different from the ones that we have\ngiven.\n\n4.2.5\n\nThe Lax Pair\n\nHere we give as an example the Lax pair for the case of the N-particle\nquantum Ruijsenaars model. We may think of the face Hopf algebra F as of\nthe elliptic quantum group associated to sl(N) introduced by Felder [100].\nWe will continue to use the the symbol F for it. In that case there is an\nadditional spectral parameter entering all relations in the same way as it is\nin the case ordinary quantum groups.\n\n\f80\n\nCHAPTER 4. QUANTUM INTEGRABLE SYSTEMS\n\nLet h be the Cartan subalgebra of sl(N) and h\u2217 its dual. The actual\ngraph related to the elliptic quantum group F is h\u2217 \u223c CN \u22121 . This is the\nhuge graph of the remark made in the introduction. However it decomposes\ninto a continuous family of disconnected graphs, each one isomorphic to\n\u2212\u03b7.\u039b, the \u2212\u03b7 \u2208 C multiple of the weight lattice \u039b of sl(N), and we can\nrestrict ourselves to this one component for simplicity. Correspondingly the\nshifts in all formulas are rescaled by a factor \u2212\u03b7. The space h\u2217 \u223c CN \u22121\nN\nitself will be considered as the\nPorthogonal complement of C = \u2295i=1,...,N C\u03b5i ,\nh\u03b5i , \u03b5j i = \u03b4ij with respect to i=1,...,N \u03b5i . We write the orthogonal projection\nP\n\u01ebi = \u03b5i \u2212 N1 k \u03b5k for the generator of h\u2217 ; h\u01ebi , \u01ebj i = \u03b4ij \u2212 1/N. The points of\nthe lattice \u03b7.\u039b will be denoted by greek characters \u03bb, \u03bc, etc.\nThe elliptic quantum group is defined by the matrix elements of the \"fundamental corepresentation\". This is described with the help of the paths of\nlength 1 in the following way: Let us associate a one-dimensional linear space\nV\u03c1,\u03bb \u223c C\u03b7.\u01ebk and a corresponding path of length 1 to any pair \u03bb, \u03c1 \u2208 \u03b7.\u039b,\nsuch that \u03c1 \u2212 \u03bb = \u03b7\u01ebk , for some k = 1, ..., N. We let V\u03c1,\u03bb = \u2205 for all other\npairs of vertices.

This will be assumed implicitly in the rest\nof this section. Now we need to specify the appropriate representation of\nF which can be read of from [105].

This is equivalent [119] to the Ruijsenaars Hamiltonian [104]. It follows\nfrom [105] that in the same way we can obtain the higher order Hamiltonians\nconcerning traces in properly fused \"fundamental representations\".\n\n\fChapter 5\nNoncommutative gauge theory\nA natural approach to gauge theory on noncommutative spaces can be based\non the simple observation that multiplication of a field by a (coordinate) function is not a covariant concept if that function does not commute with gauge\ntransformations [120]. This problem can be cured by adding appropriate\nnoncommutative gauge potentials and thus introducing covariant functions\nin complete analogy to the covariant derivatives of ordinary gauge theory.1\nThis construction is of particular interest because of its apparent relevance for\nthe description of open strings in a background B-field [121, 122, 123], where\nthe D-brane world volume can be interpreted as a noncommutative space\nwhose fluctuations are governed by a noncommutative version of Yang-Mills\ntheory [124, 125, 126, 127, 128]. It has been noticed (at least in the case of\na constant B-field) that there can be equivalent description of the effective\ntheory both in terms of noncommutative gauge theory and ordinary gauge\ntheory. From the physics perspective the two pictures are related by a choice\nof regularization [128, 129] which suggests a somewhat miraculous field redefinition that is usually called Seiberg-Witten map [128]. The inverse B-field,\nor more generally the antisymmetric part of the inverse sum of B-field and\nmetric, defines a Poisson structure \u03b8 whose quantization gives rise to the noncommutativity on the D-brane world volume. Classically, the field strength f\ndescribes fluctuations of the B-field. The Seiberg-Witten map expresses the\nnoncommutative potential \u00c2, noncommutative gauge parameter \u03bb\u0302 and noncommutative field strength in terms of their classical counter parts a, \u03bb, f as\nformal power series in \u03b8, such that noncommutative gauge transformations\n\u03b4\u0302\u03bb\u0302 are induced by ordinary gauge transformations \u03b4\u03bb :\n\u00c2(a) + \u03b4\u0302\u03bb\u0302 \u00c2(a) = \u00c2(a + \u03b4\u03bb a),\n1\n\n(5.1)\n\nFrom the phase space point of view ordinary gauge theory is in fact a special case of\nthis construction with gauge potentials for only half of the 'coordinates' (momenta).\n\n83\n\n\f84\n\nCHAPTER 5. NONCOMMUTATIVE GAUGE THEORY\n\nwhere \u03bb\u0302 is a function both of a and \u03bb. In section 5.2.1 we shall focus on\nthe rank one case and will explicitly construct the maps \u00c2(a) and \u03bb\u0302(a, \u03bb)\nto all orders in theta for the general case of an arbitrary Poisson manifold\n(which is relevant for non-constant background fields) [130, 131].2 The corresponding star products can be computed with Kontsevich's formula [132];\nthis formula continues to make sense even for non-closed B-field although\nthe corresponding star product will no longer be associative (see also [133])\nbut the non-associativity is still under control by the formality (5.93). For a\nnoncommutative gauge theory the rank one case does already include some\ninformation about the nonabelian case, since it is always possible to include\na matrix factor in the definition of the underlying noncommutative space.\nWe shall make this more precise and will extend our results to non-abelian\ngauge theories for any Lie group. The noncommutative gauge potential and\nfield strength in general take values in the universal enveloping algebra, nevertheless thanks to the existence of the Seiberg-Witten map the theory can\nbe consistently formulated in terms of only a finite number of fields; this important observation has been discussed in [9]. A prerequisite for all this is an\nappropriate formulation of gauge theory on a more or less arbitrary noncommutative space. (Here we are interested in the general case of an arbitrary\nassociative algebra of non-commuting variables, important special examples\nwith constant, linear and quadratic commutation relations have been discussed in [120].) Particularly well-suited is the approach based on the notion\nof covariant coordinates that we mentioned above3 because it finds a natural\ninterpretation in the framework of deformation quantization [135, 132, 136].\nThis is the natural setting since we are dealing with associative algebras\nand formal power series \u2013 it also allows rigorous statements by postponeing,\nor rather circumventing difficult questions related to convergence and representation theory. Deformation quantization for non-constant and possibly\ndegenerate Poisson structures goes far beyond the basic Weyl-Moyal product and the problem has only recently found a general solution [132]. To\nconstruct a Seiberg-Witten map we do in fact need the even more general\nformality theorem of Kontsevich [132]. A link between Kontsevich quantization/formality and quantum field theory is given by the path integral\napproach [137] which relates the graphs that determine the terms in the formality map to Feynman diagrams. The relevant action \u2013 a Poisson sigma\n2\n\nThis is of course neither restricted to magnetic fields \u2013 B 0i need not be zero \u2013 nor to\neven dimensional manifolds.\n3\nThis is a somewhat nonstandard formulation of noncommutative gauge theory that\nis not as intimately connected with a differential calculus as it is in Connes approach. In\nparticular examples, e.g. for the noncommutative torus, both formulations may be used\nand give the same results.\n\n\f85\nmodel \u2013 was originally studied in [138, 139]; see also [140, 141]. Our discussion\nis entirely tree-level. Aspects of the quantization of nonabelian noncommutative gauge theories have been discussed by several authors [142, 143, 144]\n(and references therein.) Closest to the present discussion is the perturbative\nstudy of \u03b8-expanded noncommutative gauge theories [145, 146].\nWe will see that the concept of covariant coordinates on noncommutative spaces leads directly to gauge theories with generalized noncommutative\ngauge fields of the type that arises in string theory with background B-fields.\nI will argue that the theory is naturally expressed in terms of cochains in an\nappropriate cohomology and will discuss how it fits into the framework of\nprojective modules. We will use the equivalence of star products that arise\nfrom the background field with and without fluctuations and Kontsevich's\nformality theorem to explicitly construct a map that relates ordinary gauge\ntheory and noncommutative gauge theory (Seiberg-Witten map.) As application we shall proof the exact equality of the Dirac-Born-Infeld action\nwith B-field in the commutative setting and its semi-noncommutative cousin\nin the intermediate picture. We will see that a consistent noncommutative\ngauge theory requires that the gauge fields couple to gravity (except on flat\nmanifolds, of course.) Introducing noncommutative extra dimensions we will\nextend the construction to noncommutative nonabelian gauge theory for arbitrary gauge groups and will in particular compute an explicit map between\nabelian and nonabelian gauge fields. All constructions are also valid for nonconstant B-field, Poisson structure, metric and coupling constant.\nThis work was done in collaboration with B. Jur\u010do and J. Wess and will be\npublished in ... In the following we will briefly review how noncommutative\ngauge theory appears in string theory.\n\nNoncommutative gauge theory in string theory\nLet us briefly recall how star products and noncommutative gauge theory\narise in string theory [122, 123, 128]: Consider an open string \u03c3-model with\nbackground B-field\n\u0013\nZ \u0012\n1\n1\ni a j\nab\ni\nj\nSB =\n(5.2)\ngij \u2202a x \u2202 x + Bij \u01eb \u2202a x \u2202b x\n4\u03c0\u03b1\u2032\n2i\n\u03a3\nwhere the integral is over the string world-sheet and B is constant, nondegenerate and dB = 0.

NONCOMMUTATIVE GAUGE THEORY\n\nFigure 5.1: Open and closed strings conformally mapped to a disc and a\nsphere respectively. The background B-field affects only the open strings\nending at the boundary of the disc and is not felt by the closed strings.\nNoncommutativity arises essentially since the open string vertex operators\nat the boundary of the disk cannot freely move past each other, while the\nclosed string vertex operators in the bulk are not affected.\nThe propagator at boundary points compatible with the boundary conditions\n(5.3) is\ni\n(5.4)\nhxi (\u03c4 )xj (\u03c4 \u2032 )i = \u2212\u03b1\u2032 Gij ln(\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4 \u2032 )2 + \u03b8ij \u03b5(\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4 \u2032 ),\n2\nwhere \u03b5(\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4 \u2032 ) is the step function and\n1\n\u03b8\n1\n=\n+\n.\n\u2032\n\u2032\ng + 2\u03c0\u03b1 B\n2\u03c0\u03b1\nG(+2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032\u03a6)\n\n(5.5)\n\n(The term 2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032 \u03a6 is relevant in the so-called intermediate picture.)

For\nPauli-Villars (5.11) remains a symmetry but if one expands exp Sa and employes a point-splitting regularization then the functional integral is invariant\nunder noncommutative gauge transformations4\n\u03b4\u0302 \u00c2i = \u2202i \u03bb\u0302 + i\u03bb\u0302 \u22c6 \u00c2i \u2212 i\u00c2i \u22c6 \u03bb\u0302.\n\n(5.12)\n\nSince a sensible quantum theory should be independent of the choice of regularization there should be field redefinitions \u00c2(a), \u03bb\u0302(a, \u03bb) (Seiberg-Witten\nmap) that relate (5.11) and (5.12):\n\u00c2(a) + \u03b4\u0302\u03bb\u0302 \u00c2(a) = \u00c2(a + \u03b4\u03bb a).\n\n(5.13)\n\nIt is instructive to study the effect of the extra factor exp Sa in the correlation\nfunction (5.6) in more detail: It effectively shifts the coordinates5\nxi \u2192 xi + \u03b8ij \u00c2j =: Dxi .\n\n(5.14)\n\nMore generally, for a function f ,\nf \u2192 f + fA =: Df.\n\n(5.15)\n\nThe mapping A : f 7\u2192 fA plays the role of a generalized gauge potential;\nit maps a function to a new function that depends on the gauge potential.\nThe shifted coordinates and functions are covariant under noncommutative\ngauge transformations:\n\u03b4\u0302(Dxi ) = i[\u03bb\u0302 \u22c6, Dxi ],\n\n\u03b4\u0302(Df ) = i[\u03bb\u0302 \u22c6, Df ].\n\n(5.16)\n\nThe first expression implies (5.12) (for \u03b8 constant and nondegenerate).\nThe covariant coordinates (5.14) are the background independent operators of [128, 150]; they and the covariant functions (5.15) can also be introduced abstractly in the general case of an arbitrary noncommutative space\nas we shall discuss in the next section.\n4\n5\n\nIn this form this formula is only valid for the Moyal-Weyl star product.\nNotation: D should not be confused with a covariant derivative (but it is related).\n\n\f88\n\nCHAPTER 5. NONCOMMUTATIVE GAUGE THEORY\n\n5.1\n5.1.1\n\nGauge theory on noncommutative spaces\nCovariant functions, covariant coordinates\n\nTake a more or less arbitrary noncommutative space, i.e. an associative unital\nalgebra Ax of noncommuting variables with multiplication \u22c6 and consider\n(matter) fields \u03c8 on this space. The fields can be taken to be elements of Ax ,\nor, more generally, a left module of it. The notion of a gauge transformation\nis introduced as usual6\n\u03c8 7\u2192 \u039b \u22c6 \u03c8,\n(5.17)\nwhere \u039b is an invertible element of Ax . In analogy to commutative geometry\nwhere a manifold can be described by the commutative space of functions\nover it, we shall refer to the elements of Ax also as functions. Later we shall\nfocus on the case where the noncommutative multiplication is a star product;\nthe elements of Ax are then in fact ordinary functions in the usual sense of\nthe word. The left-multiplication of a field with a function f \u2208 Ax does in\ngeneral not result in a covariant object because of the noncommutativity of\nAx :\nf \u22c6 \u03c8 7\u2192 f \u22c6 \u039b \u22c6 \u03c8 6= \u039b \u22c6 (f \u22c6 \u03c8).\n(5.18)\n(As in ordinary gauge theory the gauge transformation only acts on the fields,\ni.e. on the elements of the left-module of Ax and not on the elements of Ax\nitself.) To cure (5.18) we introduce covariant functions\nDf = f + fA ,\n\n(5.19)\n\nthat transform under gauge transformations by conjugation\nDf 7\u2192 \u039b \u22c6 Df \u22c6 \u039b\u22121 ,\n\n(5.20)\n\nby adding 'gauge potentials' fA with appropriate transformation property7\nfA 7\u2192 \u039b \u22c6 [f \u22c6, \u039b\u22121 ] + \u039b \u22c6 fA \u22c6 \u039b\u22121 .\n\n(5.21)\n\nFurther covariant objects can be constructed from covariant functions; the\n'2-tensor'\nF (f, g) = [Df \u22c6, Dg] \u2212 D([f \u22c6, g]),\n(5.22)\nfor instance plays the role of covariant noncommutative field strength.\n6\n\nWe shall often use the infinitesimal version \u03b4\u03c8 = i\u03bb \u22c6 \u03c8 of (5.17) \u2013 this is purely for\nnotational clarity. Other transformations, like, e.g., \u03c8 7\u2192 \u03c8 \u22c6 \u039b or \u03c8 7\u2192 \u039b \u22c6 \u03c8 \u22c6 \u039b\u22121 can\nalso be considered.\n7\nNotation: [a \u22c6, b] \u2261 a \u22c6 b \u2212 b \u22c6 a \u2261 [a, b]\u22c6 .\n\n\f5.1. GAUGE THEORY ON NONCOMMUTATIVE SPACES\n\n89\n\nCanonical structure (constant \u03b8) and noncommutative Yang-Mills\nBefore we continue let us illustrate all this in the particular simple case of\nan algebra Ax generated by 'coordinates' xi with canonical commutation\nrelations\n[xi \u22c6, xj ] = i\u03b8ij , \u03b8ij \u2208 C.\n(5.23)\nThis algebra arises in the decoupling limit of open strings in the presence of a\nconstant B-field. It can be viewed as the quantization of a Poisson structure\nwith Poisson tensor \u03b8ij and the multiplication \u22c6 is then the Weyl-Moyal star\nproduct\n\u2190 \u2192\ni ij\n\u2202i \u2297\u2202j\n\nf \u22c6 g = fe2\u03b8\n\ng.\n\n(5.24)\n\n(This formula holds only in the present example, where \u03b8ij is constant and\nwe shall also assume that it is non-degenerate. In the rest of this chapter\nwe drop both restrictions.) Let us focus on the coordinate functions xi . The\ncorresponding covariant coordinates are\nDxi = xi + xiA = xi + \u03b8ij \u00c2j ,\n\n(5.25)\n\nwhere we have used \u03b8 to lower the index on \u00c2j . Using (5.23), we see that\nthe transformation (5.21) of the noncommutative gauge potential \u00c2j is\n\u00c2j 7\u2192 i\u039b \u22c6 \u2202j (\u039b\u22121 ) + \u039b \u22c6 \u00c2j \u22c6 \u039b\u22121 ,\n\n(5.26)\n\n\u03b4 \u00c2j = \u2202j \u03bb + i[\u03bb, \u00c2j ]\u22c6 .\n\n(5.27)\n\nor, infinitesimally\nThe noncommutative field strength\nF\u0302kl = \u2202k \u00c2l \u2212 \u2202l \u00c2k \u2212 i[\u00c2k , \u00c2l ]\u22c6\n\n(5.28)\n\nF\u0302kl 7\u2192 \u039b \u22c6 F\u0302kl \u22c6 \u039b\u22121 .\n\n(5.29)\n\ntransforms covariantly\nWe have again used \u03b8 to lower indices to get (5.28) from the definition (5.22)\niF\u0302kl \u03b8ik \u03b8jl \u2261 F (xi , xj ) = [xiA , xj ]\u22c6 + [xi , xjA ]\u22c6 + [xiA , xjA ]\u22c6 .\n\n(5.30)\n\nNote, that we should in general be more careful when using \u03b8 to lower indices as in (5.25) or (5.30) because this may spoil the covariance when \u03b8 is\nnot constant as it was in this particular example. Relations (5.26), (5.28)\nand (5.29) define what is usually called Noncommutative Yang-Mills theory\n(NCYM) in the narrow sense: ordinary Yang-Mills with all matrix products replaced by star products. This simple rule, however, only really works\n\n\f90\n\nCHAPTER 5. NONCOMMUTATIVE GAUGE THEORY\n\nwell for the Moyal-Weyl product, i.e. constant \u03b8. In the general case it is\nwise to stick with the manifestly covariant and coordinate-independent8 objects defined in (5.19) and (5.22). The fundamental objects are really the\nmappings (differential operators) D and F in these equations. The transformation of A = D \u2212 id : f 7\u2192 fA under gauge transformations is exactly so\nthat (5.19) transforms by conjugation. The mappings A \u2208 Hom(Ax , Ax ) and\nF \u2208 Hom(Ax \u2227 Ax , Ax ) play the role of generalized noncommutative gauge\npotential and noncommutative field strength. There are several reasons, why\none needs A and D and not just Ai \u2261 A(xi ) (or \u00c2i , for \u03b8 constant): If we\n\u2032\nperform a general coordinate transformation xi 7\u2192 xi (xj ) and transform Ai\n(or \u00c2i ) naively as its index structure suggests, then we would obtain objects\nthat are no longer covariant under noncommutative gauge transformations.\n\u2032\nThe correct transformation, A(xi ) 7\u2192 A\u2032 (xi ), is more complicated and will\nbe discussed in section 5.2.2. Furthermore we may be interested in covariant\nversions of scalar fields \u03c6(x). These are given by the corresponding covariant\nfunction D(\u03c6(x)).\nIn the next section we will propose an abstract definition of the type of\nnoncommutative gauge theory that is of present interest. Then we shall proceed to give an interpretation in the framework of deformation quantization\nand will construct a particular important class of these operators.\n\n5.1.2\n\nCochains and projective modules\n\nFinite projective modules take the place of fiber bundles in the noncommutative realm [147]. This is also the case here, as we shall explain below, but\nmay not have been apparent since we have been working with component\nfields as is customary in the physics literature. We have argued in the pre0\nvious section that A \u2208 C 1 , F \u2208 C 2 with C p = Hom(A\u2227p\nx , Ax ), C \u2261 Ax .\nThese p-cochains take the place of forms on a noncommutative space Ax ,\nwhich for now is still an arbitrary associative algebra over a field k with\nmultiplication \u22c6. It is actually more convenient to start with the Hochschild\ncomplex of Ax , H p (Ax , Ax ) = Homk (A\u2297p\nx , Ax ), with values in Ax considered\nas a left module of Ax . (The formulas for C p can then be obtained by antisymmetrization.) We have a coboundary operator d\u22c6 : H p \u2192 H p+1 , d2\u22c6 = 0,\nd\u22c6 1 = 0,\nd\u22c6 C = \u2212[C , \u22c6 ]G ,\n(5.31)\nwhere [ , ]G is the Gerstenhaber bracket (A.4),\n(d\u22c6 C)(f1 , . . . , fp+1 ) = f1 \u22c6 C(f2 , . . . , fp+1 ) \u2212 C(f1 \u22c6 f2 , f3 , . . . , fp+1 ) +\n8\n\nWe would like to thank Anton Alekseev for stressing the importance of this point.\n\n\f5.1.

Let us\napply the Hochschild formalism to the gauge transformation dependent map\nD \u2208 H 1 that we introduced in the definition of covariant functions (5.19) in\nthe previous section. In view of the way that Ai \u2261 \u03b8ij \u00c2j appeared in the definition of covariant coordinates (5.25) we define an abstract noncommutative\ngauge potential A \u2208 H 1\nA \u2261 D \u2212 id.\n(5.35)\nApplying A to coordinate functions in the setting of (5.25) we indeed recover\nAi :\nA(xi ) = D(xi ) \u2212 xi = Ai .\nLet us compute the behavior of A under a gauge transformation. Using\n(5.20) and the definitions of d\u22c6 and the cup product we find\nA 7\u2192 \u039b \u22c6 d\u22c6 \u039b\u22121 + \u039b \u22c6 A \u22c6 \u039b\u22121 ,\n\n(5.36)\n\nwhich gives (5.21) when evaluated on a function. The corresponding infinitesimal version is\n\u03b4A = i(\u2212d\u22c6 \u03bb + \u03bb \u22c6 A \u2212 A \u22c6 \u03bb).\n(5.37)\nNext we introduce the \"Hochschild\" field strength FH \u2208 H 2\nFH \u2261 d\u22c6 A + A \u22c6 A\n\n(5.38)\n\nFH (f, g) = Df \u22c6 Dg \u2212 D(f \u22c6 g)\n\n(5.39)\n\nand compute\nand find the Bianchi identity\nd\u22c6 FH + A \u22c6 FH \u2212 FH \u22c6 A = 0.\n\n(5.40)\n\n\f92\n\nCHAPTER 5. NONCOMMUTATIVE GAUGE THEORY\n\nEvaluated on three functions f , g, h the latter reads\nD((f \u22c6 g) \u22c6 h) \u2212 D(f \u22c6 (g \u22c6 h)) + (Df \u22c6 Dg) \u22c6 Dh \u2212 Df \u22c6 (Dg \u22c6 Dh), (5.41)\nwhich is zero by associativity of Ax . FH transforms covariantly under gauge\ntransformations\nFH 7\u2192 \u039b \u22c6 FH \u22c6 \u039b\u22121 ;\n(5.42)\ninfinitesimally\n\u03b4FH = i(\u03bb \u22c6 FH \u2212 FH \u22c6 \u03bb).\n\n(5.43)\n\nWhen we compare (5.22) and (5.39), we see (as expected) that our noncommutative field strength F of the previous section is an antisymmetric\nversion of FH . We can obtain F directly by taking the antisymmetrized\nversion of Hochschild, where one considers Ax as a Lie algebra with bracket\n[a \u22c6, b] = a \u22c6 b \u2212 b \u22c6 a; this is the Chevalley cohomology of Ax with values\nin Ax : C p = Homk (A\u2227p\nx , Ax ). We find the relevant formulas in this setting\nby replacing H p with C p (whose elements are antisymmetric), and by using\ncorresponding antisymmetrized formulas for the coboundary operator d\u22c6 and\nthe cup product which we then denote by \u2227. The action of LieAx on the\nmodule Ax is given by \u22c6-multiplication as before. We now see that equation\n(5.22),\nF (f, g) = [Df \u22c6, Dg] \u2212 D([f \u22c6, g]),\n(5.44)\ncan be written\nF \u2261 d\u22c6 A + A \u2227 A.\n\n(5.45)\n\nThe remaining equations also do not change in form (as compared to the\nHochschild case): (5.45) implies\nd\u22c6 F + A \u2227 F \u2212 F \u2227 A = 0\n\n(5.46)\n\nand the behavior under (infinitesimal )gauge transformations is\n\u03b4A = i(\u2212d\u22c6 \u03bb + \u03bb \u2227 A \u2212 A \u2227 \u03bb),\n\u03b4F = i (\u03bb \u2227 F \u2212 F \u2227 \u03bb) .\n\n(5.47)\n(5.48)\n\nEquations (5.45), (5.46), (5.47) and (5.48) are reminiscent of the corresponding equations of ordinary (nonabelian) gauge theory. The correspondence is\ngiven by the following dictionary: One-forms become linear operators on Ax\nwhich take one function as argument and yield a new function, two-forms\nbecome bilinear operators on Ax which take two functions as arguments\n\n\f5.1. GAUGE THEORY ON NONCOMMUTATIVE SPACES\n\n93\n\nand return one new function, and the Lie bracket is replaced by the antisymmetrized cup product \u2227.9 As in ordinary gauge theory, it may not be\npossible to use one globally defined gauge potential A; we may need to introduce several D and corresponding gauge potentials A for functions defined\non different \"patches\". We shall come back to this later.\nRemark: One reason for going through the slightly more general Hochschild\nconstruction first is that the symmetric part of FH may also contain interesting information as we will see in section 5.2.4.

Consider a\n(finite) projective right Ax -module E. We introduce a connection on E as a\nlinear map \u2207 : E \u2297Ax C p \u2192 E \u2297Ax C p+1 for p \u2208 N0 which satisfies the Leibniz\nrule\n \u0303\n\u2207(\u03b7\u03c8) = (\u2207\u03b7)\u03c8\n+ (\u2212)p \u03b7 d\u0303\u22c6 \u03c8\n(5.52)\n \u0303 = \u2207\u03b7 \u2212 (\u2212)p \u03b7 d\u0303\u22c6 1,\nfor all \u03b7 \u2208 E \u2297Ax C p , \u03c8 \u2208 C r , and where \u2207\u03b7\nd\u0303\u22c6 (a \u2227 \u03c8) = (d\u22c6 a) \u2227 \u03c8 + (\u2212)q a \u2227 (d\u0303\u22c6 \u03c8)\n\n(5.53)\n\nfor all a \u2208 C q , and d\u0303\u22c6 1 is the identity operator on Ax . (The transformation\nof matter fields \u03b4\u0302\u03c8 = i\u03bb\u0302 \u22c6 \u03c8 leads to a slight complication here; for fields\n \u0303\nthat transform in the adjoint (by star-commutator) we would only need \u2207,\nd\u22c6 and not \u2207 and d\u0303\u22c6 .) Let (\u03b7a ) be a generating family for E; any \u03be \u2208 E\n9\n\nMore educated: n-forms become n-cochains.

It has been discussed by several authors\nhow the Moyal-Weyl star product enters the picture as a quantization of this\nPoisson structure in the constant case [122, 123, 128]. A direct approach that\nis most suitable for our purposes and that also works for non-constant \u03b8 is\ngiven by Cattaneo and Felder [137] in their QFT realization of Kontsevich's\nstar product.\nIn the introduction we have discussed what happens if we add fluctuations\nf (with df = 0, i.e. locally f = da) to the background B field: The action is\nthen naively invariant under ordinary gauge transformations \u03b4a = d\u03bb, but the\n\n\f96\n\nCHAPTER 5. NONCOMMUTATIVE GAUGE THEORY\n\ninvariance of the quantum theory depends on the choice of regularization. A\npoint splitting prescription [128, 129] leads in fact to a noncommutative gauge\ninvariance. Since in a consistent quantum theory the choice of regularization\nshould not matter, Seiberg and Witten argued that there should exist maps\nthat relate ordinary and noncommutative gauge theory such that (5.1) holds.\nA more abstract argument that leads to the same conclusion, but gives the\nSeiberg-Witten maps more directly and also works for non-constant \u03b8 can be\nbased on a quantum version of Moser's lemma [130, 131]. Here is briefly the\nidea, in the next section we will review the details: The addition of f = da\nto B defines a new Poisson structure\n1\n1\n\u03b8=\n\u2192 \u03b8\u2032 =\n(5.65)\nB\nB+f\nwhich, according to Moser's lemma, is related to the original one by a change\nof coordinates given by a flow \u03c1\u2217a that depends on the gauge potential a. After quantization \u03b8 and \u03b8\u2032 give rise to equivalent star products \u22c6 and \u22c6\u2032 . The\nequivalence map Da , the full quantum flow Da = Da \u25e6 \u03c1\u2217a and the noncommutative gauge potential\nAa = Da \u2212 id\n(5.66)\nare also functions of a.

After quantization that transformation becomes an inner derivation of the star product \u22c6 and thus a noncommutative gauge transformation \u03b4\u03bb\u0302 with \u03bb\u0302 = \u03bb\u0302(\u03bb, a), such that\nAa+d\u03bb = Aa + \u03b4\u03bb\u0302 Aa .\n\n5.2.1\n\n(5.68)\n\nSeiberg-Witten map and Kontsevich formality\n\nConsider an abelian gauge theory on a manifold that also carries a Poisson structure \u03b8.

In the previous\nsections we saw that the full information about the noncommutative gauge\nfields is encoded in the equivalence map Da . Here we can similarly reconstruct\nthe metric field from \u039e by evaluating its Hochschild field strength\nFH\u039e (xi , xj ) = \u039e(xi ) \u22c6 \u039e(xj ) \u2212 \u039e(xi \u22c6 xj ) =\n\ni~ ij\nG + o(~2 ),\n2\n\n(5.141)\n\nor more directly: Gij = 2i~ (\u039e(xi xj ) \u2212 xi xj ). Two more questions come up\nnaturally: When is \u03b8 = (B + g)\u22121\nA Poisson? Why is the relevant star product\n\u22121\nnot a quantization of \u03c4 \u2261 B as in the zero-slope limit? The answer to\nthe second question is of course that this is determined by the open string\npropagator in the presence of a background B and that happens to have an\nantisymmetric part given by \u03b8ij and only in the zero-slope limit this is equal\n\n\f110\n\nCHAPTER 5. NONCOMMUTATIVE GAUGE THEORY\n\nto B \u22121 . Nevertheless the two questions turn out to be related \u2013 the star\nproducts based on \u03c4 and \u03b8 are equivalent provided that the 2-forms\n1\nB = (\u03c4 \u22121 )ij dxi \u2227 dxj ,\n2\n\n1\n\u03c6 = \u2212 (g\u03c4 g)ij dxi \u2227 dxj\n2\n\n(5.142)\n\nare closed, \u03c6 = d\u03b1 for some 1-form \u03b1, and B(t) = B + t\u03c6 is nondegenerate\nfor t \u2208 [0, 1]; the closedness conditions on B and \u03c6 ensure in particular that\n\u03b1 and \u03b8 are Poisson. According to Moser's lemma the symplectic structures\nB(1) and B(0) are related by a change of coordinates generated by the vector\nfield \u03c7\u03b1 = \u03c4 ij \u03b1j \u2202i and, moreover, according to Kontsevich the star products\nresulting from quantization of B(0) and B(1) are equivalent. Since B(0) =\n\u03c4 \u22121 and B(1) = \u03b8\u22121 we have demonstrated our claim. Let us remark that B\nand \u03c6 are closed if g and B are derived from a K\u00e4hler metric, since then B\nis closed and B, gB \u22121 g are proportional. Instead of using Moser's lemma we\ncould also drop some assumptions and work directly with Poisson structures\nas in previous sections. We would then require that \u03c4 is Poisson and g\u03c4 g is\nclosed and introduce a 1-parameter deformation \u03c4 (t), t \u2208 [0, 1], with\n\u03c4 (0) = \u03c4,\n\n\u2202t \u03c4 (t) = \u03c4 (t) * (g\u03c4 g) * \u03c4 (t)\n\n(5.143)\n\nand solution\n\u03c4 (t) = \u03c4 + t\u03c4 g\u03c4 g\u03c4 + t2 \u03c4 g\u03c4 g\u03c4 g\u03c4 g\u03c4 + . . . = \u03c4\n\n1\n.\n1 \u2212 t(g\u03c4 )2\n\n(5.144)\n\nThis is the antisymmetric part of\n\u03b8\u0303(t) =\n1\n\n1\n1\n\nB + t2 g\n\n.\n\n(5.145)\n\n1\n\nThe symmetric part is t 2 Gij (t) = \u2212t 2 [\u03c4 (t)g\u03c4 ]ij with G(0) = \u2212B \u22121 gB \u22121 and\nG(1) = G, while \u03c4 (0) = B \u22121 and \u03c4 (1) = \u03b8 with G and \u03b8 as given in (5.136).\nThis suggest that \u03c6 = \u2212g\u03c4 g represents \"metric fluctuations\" around the\nbackground B that can be gauged away by an equivalence transformation\nthat curiously leads to the zero-slope values G(0), \u03c4 (0) of the metric and\nPoisson structure.\n\n5.3\n\nNonabelian noncommutative gauge fields\n\nWe will now extend the discussion to nonabelian gauge theories, i.e., Lie\nalgebra-valued gauge potentials and gauge fields. We will argue that a\nSeiberg-Witten map can be explicitly constructed for any gauge group by\n\n\f5.3. NONABELIAN NONCOMMUTATIVE GAUGE FIELDS\n\n111\n\ntreating both the space-time noncommutativity and the noncommutativity\nof the nonabelian gauge group on equal footing. Both structures are obtained\nfrom appropriate Poisson structures by deformation quantization. This construction generalizes to fairly arbitrary noncommutative internal spaces.\nLet us mention that it is possible to absorb a matrix factor (e.g. GL(n)\nor U(n) in the defining representation) directly into the definition of the\nnoncommutative space Ax and then work with the abelian results of the\nprevious sections, however, for other gauge groups it is not a priory clear how\nto do this consistently. In any case even for GL(n) and U(n) that approach\nwould not give a very detailed description of the nonabelian Seiberg-Witten\nmap.\n\n5.3.1\n\nNonabelian setting\n\nIn this section we shall establish notation and will give a precise definition\nof the problem that we would like to solve. Consider a manifold \"(noncommutative) space-time\" with a noncommutative structure provided by a star\nproduct that is derived from a Poisson structure \u0398\u03bc\u03bd . On this space consider\na nonabelian gauge theory with gauge group G, field strength F\u03bc\u03bd , that can\nbe locally expressed as\nF\u03bc\u03bd = \u2202\u03bc A\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd A\u03bc \u2212 i[A\u03bc , A\u03bd ]\n\n(5.146)\n\nwith nonabelian gauge potential A\u03bc = A\u03bcb T b where T b \u2208 Lie(G) are generators with commutation relations \u2212i[T a , T b ] = Ccab T c , and nonabelian gauge\ntransformations\n\u03b4\u039b A\u03bc = \u2202\u03bc \u039b + i[\u039b, A\u03bc ].\n(5.147)\nOur main goal is to find a noncommutative gauge potential \u00c2 = \u00c2(A\u03bc ) and\na noncommutative gauge parameter \u039b\u0302(A\u03bc , \u039b) such that a nonabelian gauge\ntransformation \u03b4\u039b of A\u03bc induces a noncommutative gauge transformation \u03b4\u0302\u039b\u0302\nof \u00c2:\n(5.148)\n\u00c2(A\u03bc + \u03b4\u039b A\u03bc ) = \u00c2(A\u03bc ) + \u03b4\u0302\u039b\u0302 \u00c2(A\u03bc ).\n\u00c2(A\u03bc ) should be a universal enveloping algebra-valued formal power series in\n\u0398\u03bc\u03bd , starting with \u0398\u03bc\u03bd A\u03bd \u2202\u03bc , that contains polynomials of A\u03bc and it's derivatives. Similarly \u039b\u0302(A\u03bc , \u039b) should be a universal enveloping algebra-valued\nformal power series in \u0398\u03bc\u03bd , starting with \u039b, that contains polynomials of A\u03bc ,\n\u039b and their derivatives. The product in the definition of the noncommutative gauge transformation is a combination of the star product on space-time\nand the matrix product of the T a . We expect that it should be possible to\n\n\f112\n\nCHAPTER 5. NONCOMMUTATIVE GAUGE THEORY\n\nfind expressions, where the structure constants Ccab do not appear explicitly,\nexcept via commutators of the Lie algebra-valued A\u03bc , \u039b.\nA secondary goal is to find a construction that stays as close as possible\nto the method that we used in the abelian case. There, we used a generalization of Moser's lemma to relate Poisson structures \u03b8 and \u03b8 \u2032 (and, after\nquantization, star products \u22c6 and \u22c6\u2032 ). The motivation for this and some of\nthe complications of the nonabelian case can be most easily understood in the\nspecial case of invertible, i.e. symplectic, Poisson structures. The inverses\nof \u03b8 and \u03b8\u2032 define closed 2-forms B and B \u2032 that differ by the addition of a\n(closed) gauge field f (5.65). Physically B \u2032 is the background B-field plus\nfluctuations f . In the nonabelian case we would like to keep this picture but\nwith f replaced by the nonabelian field strength F :\nB\u2032 = B + F ,\nwhere B = \u0398\u22121 . The trouble with this is that dF = \u2212A \u2227 A 6= 0 in\nthe nonabelian case so B and B \u2032 cannot both be closed 2-forms, which they\nshould be if we want to interpret their inverses as Poisson structures. Ignoring\nthis, we could then look for a \"vector field\" \u03c7 that generates a coordinate\ntransformation that relates B and B \u2032 . A natural generalization from the\nabelian case (5.72) is \u03c7 = \u0398\u03bc\u03bd A\u03bd D\u03bc , where we have replaced the abelian\ngauge potential by the nonabelian one and have also switched to a covariant\nderivative D\u03bc = \u2202\u03bc + i[A\u03bc , * ]. The trouble here is that it is not clear how\nto act with the matrix-valued \u03c7 on \"coordinates\". \u03c7 is certainly no vector\nfield; it is not even a derivation. (It's action turns out to involve complete\nsymmetrization over the constituent matrices T a .)\nThe solution to both problems is to consider a larger space that is spanned\nby the space-time coordinates x\u03bc and by symbols ta for the generators T a of\nthe Lie Group. \u03c7 is then the projection onto space-time of a true vector field\nand \u0398 and \u0398\u2032 are the space-time components of true Poisson structures on\nthe enlarged space. We obtain the desired nonabelian noncommutative gauge\ntheory by quantizing both the external and internal part of the enlarged space\nat the same time. To use the method of the previous sections we need to\nencode the nonabelian data in an abelian gauge theory on the enlarged space.\nThis program is successful, if the \"commutative\" nonabelian gauge theory\ncan be recovered at an intermediate step.\n\n5.3.2\n\nNoncommutative extra dimensions\n\nNotation: Greek indices \u03bc, \u03bd, \u03be, . . . belong to the external space, indices\nfrom the beginning of the alphabet a, b, c, . . . belong to the internal space\n\n\f5.3. NONABELIAN NONCOMMUTATIVE GAUGE FIELDS\n\n113\n\nand indices i, j, k, . . . run over the whole space (internal and external). We\nshall use capital letters (A\u03bc , F\u03bc\u03bd , \u0398\u03bc\u03bd ) for things related to the nonabelian\ntheory on the external space and small letters (ai , fij , \u03b8ij ) for objects related\nto the abelian theory on the enlarged space or the internal space (ab , \u03b8bc ).\nThe ta are commutating coordinate functions on the internal space (\"Lie\nalgebra\") just like the x\u03bc are commuting coordinate functions on the external space (\"space-time\"). We later recover the Lie algebra in the form\nof star-commutators on the internal space and the matrices T a by taking a\nrepresentation of that algebra.

The other components of \u03b8(t) are computed\nsimilarly (again using fab = 0):\n\u03b8\u03bcb (t) = \u2212\u03b8b\u03bc (t) = \u2212t\u0398\u03bc\u03bd (t)f\u03bda \u03b8ab ,\n\n\u03b8ab (t) = \u03b8ab + t2 [\u03b8f \u0398(t)f \u03b8]ab .\n(5.157)\n\u0398(t) is not the only object that acquires a non-abelian look at t = 1; this is\nalso the case for Moser's vector field\na\u03b8\u2032 = (\u03b8\u2032 )ij aj \u2202i = (\u0398\u2032 )\u03bc\u03bd \u0100\u03bd D\u0304\u03bc + \u03b8ab ab \u2202a ,\n\n(5.158)\n\nwhere \u0100\u03bd = a\u03bd \u2212 f\u03bda \u03b8ab ab and D\u0304\u03bc = \u2202\u03bc \u2212 f\u03bca \u03b8ab \u2202b are the first terms in the\nexpansions for the nonabelian gauge potential and covariant derivative, valid\naround the special gauge ab = 0 (see next section.)\nNow we need to identify appropriate abelian gauge fields and gauge transformations on the enlarged space that upon quantization give the desired\nnonabelian noncommutative gauge fields and noncommutative gauge transformations. For this we consider the terms of lowest order in \u0398 of the SeibergWitten condition, where we expect to see a purely nonabelian gauge transformation.

Since we would like to\nidentify A\u03bc and \u039b with the gauge potential and parameter of the ordinary\nnonabelian gauge theory that we started with, they should both be linear in\nthe coordinates ta of the internal space. Studying gauge transformations and\nthe explicit expression (5.78), (5.79) for Aa (x\u03bc ) (see next section) we find\nthat this implies that the internal components of the abelian gauge potential\nare independent of the ta , while the external components are linear in the ta .\nThis is preserved by abelian gauge transformations with gauge parameters\nthat are linear in the ta :\na\u03bc = a\u03bcb (x)tb ,\n\n\u03bb = \u03bbb (x)tb ;\n\n\u03b4a\u03bc = i(\u2202\u03bc \u03bbb )tb ,\n\n\u03b4ab = i\u03bbb .\n(5.161)\nThe gauge invariant characterization of the desired abelian gauge fields is\nfab = 0, f\u03bcb = \u2212fb\u03bc independent of the ta , f\u03bc\u03bd linear in the ta .
