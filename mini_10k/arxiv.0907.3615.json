The\ndamped-driven \u03c64 theory arises in a variety of physical\ncontexts, in particular in the description of topologicaldefect dynamics in media with temporally [5] and spatially [6] modulated parameters or in the presence of\nfluctuations [7]. Examples include the drift of domain\nwalls in ferromagnets in oscillatory magnetic fields [8];\nthe Brownian motion of string-like objects on a periodically modulated bistable substrate [10]; ratchet dynamics\nof kinks in a lattice of point-like inhomogeneities [11] and\nrectification in Josephson junctions and optical lattices\n[12]. The damped \u03c64 equation driven by noise was used\nto study the production of topological defects during the\nsymmetry-breaking phase transition [13] and spatiotemporal stochastic resonance in a chain of bistable elements\n[14].\n\nficiently large driving strengths. Next, in an influential\npaper [8], Sukstanskii and Primak considered the continuous \u03c64 equation with a combination of direct and parametric driving. (See also a related discussion in [9].) Using a variant of the Lindstedt-Poincar\u00e9 technique where\nthe velocity of the kink is adjusted so as to eliminate secular terms at the lowest orders of the perturbation expansion in powers of the wobbling amplitude, they detected a\nslow unidirectional motion of the kink. In their analysis,\nSukstanskii and Primak were not concerned with terms\nhigher than quadratic in the amplitude of the wobbling;\nin fact, their approach is not suitable to deal with secular\nterms at the \u01eb3 -order of the expansion. Neither can it be\nutilised in the case of the resonant driving frequency.\n\nThe resonant situation was studied by Quintero,\nS\u00e1nchez and Mertens [2, 3, 4] who employed the method\nof projections. The method assumes a specific functional\ndependence of the kink on the \"collective co-ordinates\",\nwhich in this case are the width and position of the\nkink. Inserting the chosen ansatz in the partial differential equation and projecting the result onto the neutral modes associated with the two degrees of freedom,\none obtains a two-dimensional dynamical system, a simplification from the infinite degrees of freedom present\nin the original partial differential equation. (In the unThe mathematical analysis of the damped-driven kinks\ndamped undriven situation, the collective coordinate apstarted with the work of Kivshar, S\u00e1nchez and V\u00e1zquez\n4\nproach was pioneered by Rice and Mele [15, 16].) The\n[5] who studied the discrete parametrically pumped \u03c6\nmajor advantage of the method is that if the collective\nsystem.

The drawback of\n\u2217 Electronic address: Oliver.Oxtoby@gmail.com\nthe collective coordinate approach, however, is that one\n\u2020 Electronic address: igor@odette.mth.uct.ac.za; Igor.Barashenkov@uct.ac.za\ncannot know beforehand which degrees of freedom are\n\n\f2\nessential and which can be omitted without a qualitative\nimpact on the kink's dynamics. Specifically, the role of\nradiation (which is neglected in the approach in question) is not obvious and therefore one has no a priori\nguarantee that a radiationless ansatz is adequate. Another disadvantage is that the resulting two-dimensional\ndynamical system is amenable to analytical study only\nin a very special case (when the damping is set to zero\n[2, 3, 4]).\nIn this paper, we approach the resonantly driven wobbling kink from a complementary perspective. Instead\nof trying to guess the most pertinent set of collective\nvariables, we construct the wobbler as a singular perturbation expansion using a sequence of space and time\nscales. The nonsecularity conditions yield equations for\nthe slow-time evolution of the wobbling amplitude and\nkink velocity. This asymptotic procedure has already\nbeen implemented for the unperturbed \u03c64 equation [21];\nhere we extend it to include damping and driving terms.\nWe consider both external (direct) and parametric driving, at several resonant frequencies. This includes the\ncases considered by Quintero, S\u00e1nchez and Mertens in\n[2, 3, 4]. Although the multiscale expansion cannot crystallise the \"minimum set\" of degrees of freedom accountable for the observed behaviour, it does not suffer from\nthe arbitrariness associated with the choice of collectivecoordinate ansatz. The multiscale expansion is asymptotic, i.e. only valid for small amplitudes of the wobbling\nmode; however, in the small-amplitude limit the expansion provides a faithful description of the wobbler, independent of any assumptions and mode pre-selections.\nImportantly, it does not neglect the radiation.\nIn all four cases of the direct and parametric driving considered in this paper, we derive an autonomous\nsystem of equations for the amplitude of the wobbling\nmode and velocity of the kink. In each of the four cases\nthis dynamical system turns out to exhibit stable fixed\npoints corresponding to the nondecaying wobbling of the\nkink. In some parameter regimes, the amplitude of stable wobbling is nonunique and may undergo hysteretic\ntransitions between two nonzero values. In another case,\nthe wobbling is necessarily accompanied by translational\nmotion of the kink. The conclusions of our asymptotic\nanalysis have been verified in direct numerical simulations of the corresponding partial differential equation.\nThe numerical procedure we shall be using throughout\nthis paper was specified in [21].\nAn outline of this paper is as follows. In sections II and\nIII we study the parametrically driven wobbling kink. In\nsection II the frequency of the driver is chosen near the\nnatural wobbling frequency of the kink while in III, we\ntake the forcing frequency close to double that value. In\nthe next section (IV), we compare the mechanisms that\nare at work in each of the two cases. Subsequently, we\nconsider the kink driven directly - first near half of its\nnatural wobbling frequency (section V) and then close to\nthe wobbling frequency itself (section VI). Our conclusions are summarised in section VII. Here, in particular,\n\nwe rank the four resonances according to the amplitude\nof the resulting stationary wobbling and according to the\nwidth of the resonant frequency range.\nII.\nA.\n\n1 : 1 PARAMETRIC RESONANCE\nAsymptotic Multiscale Expansion\n\nWe start with the parametric driving of the form\n1\n2 \u03c6tt\n\n\u2212 12 \u03c6xx + \u03b3\u03c6t \u2212 [1 + h cos(\u03a9t)] \u03c6 + \u03c63 = 0.\n\n(1)\n\nThis type of a driver was previously considered by Quintero, S\u00e1nchez and Mertens [4]. The driving frequency\n\u03a9 is assumed to be slightly detuned from \u03c90 , the linear\nwobbling frequency of the undriven kink:\n\u03a9 = \u03c90 (1 + \u03c1).\n\u221a\nWe remind the reader that \u03c90 = 3 [21]. Introducing a\nsmall parameter \u01eb (which will be used to measure the amplitude of the wobbling mode in what follows) we choose\nthe detuning in the form\n\u03c1 = \u01eb2 R,\nwhere R is of order one. Since the frequency of the free\nnonlinear wobbling is smaller than \u03c90 {see Eq.(44) in\n[21]}, we expect that the strongest resonance will occur\nnot when \u03a9 = \u03c90 but for some small negative \u03c1. [This\nwill indeed be the case; see Eq.(29) below.]\nNext, the parameters \u03b3 > 0 and h > 0 are the small\ndamping coefficient and driving strength, respectively.\nWe choose the following scaling laws for these parameters:\n\u03b3 = \u01eb2 \u0393,\n\nh = \u01eb3 H,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u0393 and H are quantities of order 1. This choice\nof scalings will give rise to amplitude equations featuring the driving term of the same order of magnitude as\nthe linear and nonlinear damping terms (so that the stationary wobbling regimes become possible). We assume\nthat the kink moves with a slowly varying, small velocity:\nv = \u01ebV where V = V (T1 , T2 , . . .) is of order 1.\nBefore embarking on the perturbation expansions, we\ntransform Eq.(1) to the co-moving reference frame:\n1\nv\u03c4\n1 \u2212 v2\n(1 + \u03c1)2 \u03c6\u03c4 \u03c4 \u2212 v(1 + \u03c1)\u03c6\u03be\u03c4 \u2212 (1 + \u03c1)\u03c6\u03be \u2212\n\u03c6\u03be\u03be\n2\n2\n2\n\u2212\u03c6 + \u03c63 = h cos(\u03c90 \u03c4 )\u03c6 + \u03b3v\u03c6\u03be \u2212 \u03b3(1 + \u03c1)\u03c6\u03c4 .\n(3)\nHere\n\u03be = x\u2212\n\nZ\n\nt\n\nv(t\u2032 )dt\u2032 .\n0\n\nWe have also changed t \u2192 \u03c4 , where\n\u03a9t = \u03c90 \u03c4.\n\n(4)\n\n\f3\nWe now expand the field \u03c6(\u03be, \u03c4 ) about the kink \u03c60 \u2261\ntanh \u03be:\n\u03c6 = \u03c60 + \u01eb\u03c61 + \u01eb2 \u03c62 + . . . .\n\nthe first of these equations is D1 V = 0 and the solution\nis\n(0)\n\n\u03c62 = 2|A|2 sech2 X0 tanh X0\n\u0013\n\u0012 2\nV\n2\n\u2212 3|A| X0 sech2 X0\n+\n2\n\n(5)\n\nWe also define \"slow\" space and time variables\nXn \u2261 \u01ebn \u03be,\n\nTn \u2261 \u01ebn \u03c4,\n\nn = 0, 1, 2, ...,\n\n(see [21]).

For all a with |a| > r0 , the righthand side of (21) is negative and so no trajectories can\nescape to infinity. On the other hand, applying Dulac's\ncriterion (with Dulac's function equal to a constant), one\ncan easily ascertain that Eq.(19a) with v = 0 does not\nhave closed orbits. Hence, all trajectories must flow towards fixed points with finite |a|.\nThe fixed points of the system (19a) are given by the\nequation\n(\u03b3 + i\u03c90 \u03c1)a \u2212\n\ni\u03c90 \u03b6 2\n\u03c0i\u03c90\n|a| a = \u2212\nh.\n2\n8\n\n(22)\n\nFrom Eq.(22), the absolute value of a satisfies\nH(|a|2 ) = h,\n\n(23)\n\nwhere the function H(|a|2 ) is defined by\n\"\u0012\n\u00132 \u0012\n\u00132 #\n64\n\u03b6\n\u03b6\n\u03b3\nI\nR\nH2 = 2 |a|2\n.\n+ |a|2 + \u03c1 \u2212\n|a|2\n\u03c0\n\u03c90\n2\n2\n(24)\n\n(25)\n\nIn this case H(|a|2 ) is a monotonically growing function,\nwith the range (0, \u221e). Eq.(23) has a single positive root\n|a|2 for any h and the dynamical system (19) has a single\nstationary point. This fixed point is always stable.\nNow let \u03c1 < \u03c10 . Here, the range of the function H(|a|2 )\nis still (0, \u221e); however the function grows for small and\nlarge values of |a|2 but decreases in the intermediate interval |a\u2212 |2 < |a|2 < |a+ |2 , where\np\n2 2\u03b1 \u00b1 \u03b12 \u2212 3\u03b2 2\n2\n|a\u00b1 | =\n,\n(26a)\n3\n|\u03b6|2\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\n; \u03b2 = \u03b6I \u03c1 + \u03b6R\n.\n(26b)\n\u03b1 = \u03b6R \u03c1 \u2212 \u03b6I\n\u03c90\n\u03c90\nConsequently, Eq.(23) has a single root for small and\nlarge values of h and three roots in the intermediate region defined by h+ < h < h\u2212 , where\nh\u00b1 = H(|a\u00b1 |2 ).\n\nSince a is complex, Eq.(19) defines a dynamical system\nin three dimensions. However, equation (19b) will damp\nthe variable v until it is of order |a|3 and this will make\nthe term v 2 a negligible in Eq.(19a). Thus, after an initial\ntransient, the dynamics will be determined by the twodimensional system (19a) with v = 0. Next, the natural\nwobbling amplitude a may depend, parametrically, on \u03be.\nHowever, equation (15) and the fact that v \u2192 0 as t\ngrows, imply that a may only depend on \u03be via X2 , X3 ,\netc. That is, the dependence is weak.\nLetting a = re\u2212i\u03b8 , Eq.(19a) yields\n\u1e59 = \u2212\n\nAssume, first, that \u03c1 > \u03c10 , where\n\u221a\n1 \u03b6I \u2212 3\u03b6R\n\u221a\n\u03c10 (\u03b3) =\n\u03b3 = \u22121.139\u03b3.\n\u03c90 \u03b6R + 3\u03b6I\n\n(27)\n\nFor the dynamical system (19) this implies that there is\nonly one fixed point (which is stable) for small and large\nh, but as h approaches the value h+ from below or the\nvalue h\u2212 from above, two new fixed points are born in\na saddle-node bifurcation. The region h+ < h < h\u2212 is\ncharacterised by bistability; an adiabatic variation of h\nwill result in hysteretic transitions between two stable\nfixed points.\nThe existence of hysteresis has been verified in the\ndirect numerical simulations of Eq.(1), with \u03b3 = 0.01.\nStarting with h = 0 we increased h past h\u2212 , and then\nreduced it back to zero. At each h-step, we used the final\nvalues of \u03c6(x) and \u03c6t (x) from the previous-step simulation as initial conditions for the new run. For each\nh we measured the value of a to which the numerical\nsolution settled after transients died out. The resulting amplitude |a| is shown in Fig.1; clearly visible is the\nhysteresis loop. Fig.1 corresponds to simulations with\n\u03c1 = \u22120.03; for \u03c1 = \u22120.02 the hysteresis loop is smaller\nand for \u03c1 = \u22120.01 it disappears completely. This is consistent with the value of \u03c10 given by Eq.(25). The value\nh\u2212 = 0.008 at which the amplitude was recorded to jump\nfrom the bottom to the top branch in Fig.1, and the value\nh+ = 0.005 at which it dropped back as h was decreased,\nare also in agreement with the corresponding predictions\nof the amplitude equation. Namely, Eqs.(26),(24) and\n(27) give h\u2212 = 8.2 \u00d7 10\u22123 and h+ = 4.9 \u00d7 10\u22123 .\nFor any given h, equation (23) can be regarded as\na quadratic equation for the detuning \u03c1 where the coefficients are explicit functions of |a|2 . There are two\nroots \u03c11,2 for |a|2 smaller than |ares |2 , and none for\n|a|2 > |ares |2 , where |ares |2 is a unique positive root of\nthe equation\n\u0012\n\u00132\n64\n\u03b3\n\u03b6I\n2\n2\n|ares |\n+ |ares |\n= h2 .\n(28)\n\u03c02\n\u03c90\n2\n\n\f5\n0.35\n0.3\n0.25\n|a|\n\n0.2\n0.15\n0.1\n0.05\n0\n0\n\n0.002\n\n0.004\n\n0.006\nh\n\n0.008\n\n0.01\n\n0.012\n\nFIG. 1: The hysteresis loop observed in the 1 : 1 parametrically driven \u03c64 equation, Eq.(1), with \u03b3 = 0.01 and\n\u03c1 = \u22120.03. The driving strength h is increased from 0 to\n0.0125 in increments of 5 \u00d7 10\u22124 , and then reduced back to\n0 as indicated by arrows. Crosses mark simulations of the\nequation (1); continuous and dashed lines depict stable and\nunstable fixed points of the amplitude equation (19a) with\nv = 0.\n\nThe value |ares | defined by (28) gives the largest amplitude of the wobbling achievable for the given driving\nstrength h.

The interpretation of different terms in (30) is the same as in the case\nof the freely wobbling kink [21].\nLike the corresponding formula for the free wobbler,\nthe expansion (30) is only valid at distances |\u03be| = O (1).\nFor larger distances one has to use the outer expansions\n\u03c6 = \u00b11 + \u01eb2 \u03c62 + \u01eb3 \u03c63 + ...,\n\n2 : 1 PARAMETRIC RESONANCE\n\nIII.\n\nA.\n\n(29)\n\nensures the strongest resonance. As was expected, the\nstrongest resonance is achieved with negative detuning.\n\nC.\n\nwith coefficients \u03c6n determined as in section V of [21].\nThe analysis of the outer equations produces results\nequivalent to those in [21]: The second-harmonic radiation propagates away from the core of the kink at the\ngroup velocity, leaving in its wake a sinusoidal\nwave with\n\u221a\nthe frequency 2\u03a9, wavenumber k0 = 8 and constant\namplitude of the order |a|2 .\nUnlike the case of the free wobbling of the kink, the\nfrequency of the oscillation is not determined by its amplitude but is locked to the frequency of the driver, \u03a9.\nAnother difference from the undamped undriven case is\nthat the driven oscillations of the wobbler do not die out\nas t \u2192 \u221e. Instead, the amplitude of the oscillations approaches a nonzero constant value which is determined\nby the parameters of the damping and driving and -\nin the bistable region - by the initial conditions. On\nthe other hand, the asymptotic velocity of the dampeddriven wobbler is zero.\nIt is interesting to note that unlike in the case of the\nparametrically driven damped linear oscillator [18] or\ndamped-driven breather of the sine-Gordon or \u03c64 equation [19], there is no threshold driving strength in the case\nof the damped-driven wobbler. No matter how small is\nh, the amplitude a(t) will not decay to zero as t \u2192 \u221e.\n\n(31)\n\nAsymptotic Expansion\n\nIt is a textbook fact that the strongest parametric resonance is achieved when the parameter of the oscillator\nis varied at double its natural frequency. With an eye\nto the detection of the most efficient driving regime for\nthe wobbling kink, we now consider the driving frequency\nclose to twice its natural wobbling frequency:\n1\n2 \u03c6tt\n\n\u2212 21 \u03c6xx + \u03b3\u03c6t \u2212 [1 + h cos(2\u03a9t)] \u03c6 + \u03c63 = 0.

With the\n\u0001 addition of\nthe \u01eb2 -strong driving, the equation at O \u01eb2 acquires additional terms on the right hand side as compared to\n\n\f6\nEq.(7):\n\nThe solvability condition for the 0th harmonic gives\n\nH\n1 2\nD \u03c62 + L\u03c62 = F2 (X0 , ...; T0 , ...) + \u03c60 e2i\u03c90 T0 + c.c.\n2 0\n2\nHere F2 is as in Eq.(8). The zeroth- and first-harmonic\ncomponents of \u03c62 are not affected by this extra term.\nNamely, assuming that the solution is in the form (9)\n(0)\nand setting D1 V = 0, we get Eq.(10) for \u03c62 while im(1)\nposing D1 A = 0, Eq.(15) produces \u03c62 = 0. As for the\n(2)\ncoefficient function \u03c62 , we obtain\n(2)\n\n\u03c62 = A2 f1 (X0 ) + Hf2 (X0 ),\n\nD2 V = \u22122\u0393V.\nWe finally write the amplitude and velocity equations\nin terms of the natural variables a = \u01ebA and v = \u01ebV and\nthe unscaled time t (as in the previous section):\n1\n\u0227 = \u2212\u03b3a \u2212 i\u03c90 \u03c1a + i\u03c90 \u03b6|a|2 a\n2\n\u0001\n1\n1\n2\n\u2212 i\u03c90 v a \u2212 i\u03c90 \u03c3ha\u2217 + O |a|5 ,\n2\n2\u0001\nv\u0307 = \u22122\u03b3v + O |a|5 .\n\n(33)\n\nwhere the function f2 (X0 ) satisfies\n\nB.\n\n1\n(L \u2212 6)f2 (X0 ) = tanh X0 .\n2\n\n(34)\n\nWe note that the value 6 lies in the continuous spectrum\nof the operator L, and so in order to determine f2 (X0 )\nuniquely, one has to impose two additional conditions\nfixing the coefficients of two bounded homogeneous solutions that can be added to f2 . We do this by requiring the\nabsence of incoming radiation. The particular solution of\n(34) which obeys these radiation boundary conditions is\n1\n1\nf2 (X0 ) = \u2212 f1 (X0 )+ tanh X0 (2 sech2 X0 \u22123), (35)\n12\n24\nwhere the function f1 (X0 ) is given by Eq.(12). In what\nfollows, we will use the fact that f2 (X0 ) is an odd function.\nThe first term in the right-hand side of (33) describes\nthe familiar second-harmonic radiation from the freely\nwobbling kink. The second term consists of the induced\nsecond-harmonic radiation and a standing wave - also\nexcited by the forcing.\nAt the order \u01eb3 , we get the equation (16) where F3\nis given by Eq.(17) with the term 12 Hei\u03c90 T0 \u03c60 replaced\nwith 12 He2i\u03c90 T0 \u03c61 .

This two-dimensional dynamical\nsystem does not have periodic orbits, as one can readily check using Dulac's criterion. Letting a = re\u2212i\u03b8 and\n\u03c3 = |\u03c3|eiArg\u03c3 , Eq.(37a) yields\n\u1e59 = \u2212\u03b3r +\n\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u03c90\n\u03b6I r r02 sin(2\u03b8 + Arg \u03c3) \u2212 r2 ,\n2\n\n(38)\n\nwhere r02 = (|\u03c3|/\u03b6I )h.

For the nontrivial points, we get\nH(|a|2 ) = h,\n\n(41)\n\nwhere\n4\nH =\n|\u03c3|2\n2\n\n\"\u0012\n\n\u03b3\n\u03b6I\n+ |a|2\n\u03c90\n2\n\n\u00132\n\n\u00132 #\n\u0012\n\u03b6R 2\n.\n+ \u03c1\u2212\n|a|\n2\n\nAssume, first, that \u03c1 > \u03c10 , where\n\u03c10 (\u03b3) =\n\n1 \u03b6I\n\u03b3 = \u22120.03146\u03b3.\n\u03c90 \u03b6R\n\n(42)\n\nThe function H(|a|2 ) with \u03c1 in this parameter range is\nmonotonically growing, from h+ to infinity. The equation (41) has one root provided h > h+ , and no roots\n\n\f7\notherwise. Consequently, in the region h > h+ the dynamical system (37) has 2 stable fixed points a1 and \u2212a1 ,\nwhere\np\n2\u03b1 + |\u03b6\u03c3|2 h2 \u2212 4\u03b2 2\n2\n|a1 | =\n,\n(43)\n|\u03b6|2\nwith \u03b1 and \u03b2 as in (26b). In the region h < h+ , the\n(stable) fixed point at the origin is the only fixed point\navailable in the system. (Thus we have a supercritical\npitchfork bifurcation as h is increased through h = h+ .)\nAssume now \u03c1 < \u03c10 . As |a|2 grows from zero to infinity,\nthe function H decreases from h+ to its lowest value of\nh\u2212 , where\n\u0012\n\u00132\n|\u03c3|2 2\n\u03b3\n1\n+ \u03b6I \u03c1 ,\nh\u2212 = 2 \u03b6R\n(44)\n4\n|\u03b6|\n\u03c90\n\nand then increases to infinity. Therefore, for \u03c1 < \u03c10 , the\ndynamical system (37) has one fixed point at the origin\nfor small driving strengths 0 < h < h\u2212 ; 5 fixed points\na1 , a2 , 0, \u2212a1 , and \u2212a2 for the intermediate strengths\nh\u2212 < h < h+ ; and 3 fixed points a1 , 0, and \u2212a1 for\nh > h+ . Here h+ is given by Eq.(40) and h\u2212 by (44).\nThe nontrivial fixed points a1 and a2 are born in a saddlenode bifurcation at h = h\u2212 . At h = h+ , a subcritical\npitchfork bifurcation occurs; here, the point a2 merges\nwith the trivial fixed point. Therefore, out of the two\nnontrivial fixed points a1 and a2 , the stable one is a1 , i.e.\nthe fixed point with the larger absolute value - given by\nEq.(43). In summary, for h < h\u2212 all trajectories flow to\nthe origin; for h > h+ they are attracted to the nontrivial\nfixed points \u00b1a1 , and, finally, in the region h\u2212 < h < h+\nwe have a tristability between a = 0 and a = \u00b1a1 .\nThese predictions of the amplitude equation were\ncompared to results of direct numerical simulations of\nEq.(32), with \u03b3 = 0.005. As in the previous section,\nwe increased h past h+ and then reduced it to values\nunder h\u2212 . Fig.2 shows the hysteresis loop arising for\n\u03c1 = \u22120.005. For \u03c1 = \u22120.003 the hysteresis was less\npronounced and for \u03c1 = 0 it was seen to disappear completely. These observations are consistent with the value\nof the critical detuning (42) which, for \u03b3 = 0.005, equals\n\u03c10 = \u22121.573 \u00d7 10\u22124 . The bifurcation values h\u00b1 observed in simulations with \u03c1 = \u22120.005 (h+ = 0.019 and\nh\u2212 = 0.011), are also in agreement with the predictions\nof the amplitude equation (which gives h+ = 0.01938 and\nh\u2212 = 0.01059).\nC.\n\n2:1 Parametrically Driven Wobbler\n\nRestricting ourselves to the t \u2192 \u221e asymptotic behavior of \u03c6(x, t), the leading orders of the perturbation\nexpansion in the case of the subharmonic response are\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03c6(x, t) = tanh (1 \u2212 3|a|2 )\u03be + a sech \u03be tanh \u03beei\u03a9t + c.c.\n\n+ 2|a|2 sech2 \u03be tanh \u03be\n\u0001\n\u0002 2\n\u0003\n+ a f1 (\u03be) + hf2 (\u03be) e2i\u03a9t + c.c. + O |a|3 .

The\ndriving strength is increased from 0.005 to 0.025 in increments\nof 8 \u00d7 10\u22124 , and then reduced back to 0.005. Crosses mark\nresults of simulations of Eq.(32). The continuous and dashed\nlines show the stable and unstable fixed points of the amplitude equation (37a) with v = 0.\n\nHere \u03be = x\u2212x0 ; a is a stable fixed point (zero or nonzero)\ngiven by one of the roots of (39), and the functions f1 and\nf2 are defined by Eqs.(12) and (35), respectively. The\nmain difference from the case of the 1 : 1 parametric resonance is that the amplitude of the wobbling approaches\na nonzero value only if the driver's strength exceeds a\ncertain threshold; this threshold value is given by h+ in\nthe region \u03c1 > \u03c10 and by h\u2212 in the region \u03c1 < \u03c10 . If h\nlies below the threshold, the wobbling dies out and we\nneed to set a = 0 in Eq.(45). We also note that the 2 : 1\nresonant driving excites a standing wave and radiation\nwith the frequency 2\u03a9 and amplitude proportional to h\n[the f2 -term in (45)].\nAs Eq.(30) of the previous section, the expansion (45)\nis only valid on the lengthscale \u03be = O (1). To describe the\nwaveform at longer distances, we need to invoke the outer\nexpansions (31). Evaluating the coefficient of the term\n\u01eb2 in these expansions and matching it to the \"inner\"\nexpression (33) in the overlap region, we obtain\n\u03c62 = \u00b1J B\u00b1 ei(2\u03c90 T0 \u2213k0 X0 ) + c.c. \u2212\n\nH\ncos(2\u03c90 T0 ), (46)\n4\n\nwhere the top and bottom sign pertain to the regions\nX0 > 0 and X0 < 0, respectively. In Eq.(46), J = (2 \u2212\nik0 )J2\u221e and the functions B\u00b1 = B\u00b1 (X1 , X2 , ...; T1 , T2 , ...)\nsatisfy\nB\u00b1 (0, 0, ...; T1 , T2 , ...) = A2 (0, 0, ...; T2 , T3 , ...)\u2212\n\nH\n. (47)\n96\n\nEq.(47) represents the boundary condition for the amplitudes B\u00b1 ; the equations of motion for these variables\narise at the order \u01eb3 and coincide with Eqs.(33) of [21].\nThe solution of these equations with the boundary condition (47) is qualitatively similar to the solution with the\n\n\f8\n\"undriven\" boundary condition B\u00b1 (0, 0, ...; T1 , T2 , ...) =\nA2 (0, 0, ...; T2, T3 , ...). Namely, we have two outwardpropagating waves leaving the amplitudes B\u00b1 equal to\nthe constant A2 \u2212 H/96 in their wake.\n\nIV. HARMONIC VS SUBHARMONIC\nPARAMETRIC RESONANCE: QUALITATIVE\nCOMPARISON\n\nWith the amount of detail that we had to provide\nto justify our conclusions and derivations, the resonance\nmechanisms of the driven wobbling kink may not be easy\nto crystallise. The purpose of this short section is to discuss the two parametric resonances qualitatively - in\nparticular, to comment on their atypical hierarchy.\nWe observed that the amplitude |a| is of the order h1/3\nin the case of the harmonic resonance (i.e. the resonance\narising when\u0001 the driving frequency \u03c9d is near \u03c90 ) but\nonly O h1/2 in the case of the subharmonic resonance\n(the resonance arising for \u03c9d \u2248 2\u03c90 ). Thus the harmonic resonance is stronger than the subharmonic one,\nand this is precisely the opposite behaviour to what we\nmight na\u0131\u0308vely expect based on our intuition about the\nparametric driving.\nTo explain this surprising behaviour qualitatively, we\nwrite the term h cos(n\u03a9t)\u03c6 in Eqs.(1) and (32) as\nh cos(n\u03a9t)\u03c60 plus terms of order ha and smaller. This\nrepresentation reveals that what was introduced as a\nparametric driver is, to the leading order, an external\n(direct) driving force. This driving force is nonhomogeneous, i.e. its magnitude and direction vary with the\ndistance, and it has odd spatial parity. When n = 1, the\nfrequency of this driving force coincides with the natural\nfrequency of the wobbler and its spatial parity coincides\nwith the parity of the wobbling mode (which is also odd).\nAs a result, we have a strong direct resonance.\nWhen n = 2, the external force h cos(2\u03a9t)\u03c60 is not\nin resonance with the wobbling frequency. However the\nfunction h cos(2\u03a9t) acts as a parametric driver on the\nnext term in the expansion of \u03c6 - that is, the product\nh cos(2\u03a9t)\u01eb\u03c61 has the resonant frequency. Importantly,\nthis term has the \"correct\", odd, parity as a function of\n\u03be.\nIn addition, the odd-parity force h cos(2\u03a9t)\u03c60 generates odd-parity radiation and the odd-parity standing\nwave, both with the frequency 2\u03a9. This radiation and\nstanding wave also couple to the wobbling mode, via the\nterm \u01eb3 \u03c60 \u03c61 \u03c62 in Eq.(32). This constitues a concurrent\ndriving mechanism. Since each of the two mechanisms is\nindirect (i.e. requires the wobbling mode as a mediator\nfor the frequency halving) and since the resulting effective driving strength is proportional to the amplitude of\nthe wobbling mode (assumed small), the response to the\nfrequency 2\u03a9 is weaker than to \u03a9.\n\n1 : 2 DIRECT RESONANCE\n\nV.\n\nA.\n\nPerturbation Expansion\n\nWe start with the direct driving at half the natural wobbling frequency. This and the following case of\nthe 1 : 1 direct resonance were previously considered by\nQuintero, S\u00e1nchez and Mertens [2, 3] and so we will be\nable to compare our results to theirs. The equation is\n\u0012 \u0013\n1\n1\n\u03a9\n3\n\u03c6tt \u2212 \u03c6xx + \u03b3\u03c6t \u2212 \u03c6 + \u03c6 = h cos\nt ,\n(48)\n2\n2\n2\nwhere, as in the previous sections, \u03a9 = \u03c90 (1 + \u03c1). As\nbefore, we change the time variable so that \u03a9t = \u03c90 \u03c4\nand transform the equation to the moving frame:\n1 \u2212 v2\nv\u03c4\n\u03c6\u03be\u03be\n\u2212 v(1 + \u03c1)\u03c6\u03be\u03c4 \u2212 (1 + \u03c1)\u03c6\u03be \u2212\n2\n2\n\u0010\u03c9 \u0011\n0\n\u2212 \u03c6 + \u03c63 = h cos\n\u03c4 + v\u03b3\u03c6\u03be \u2212 \u03b3(1 + \u03c1)\u03c6\u03c4 . (49)\n2\n\n2\n1\n2 (1 + \u03c1) \u03c6\u03c4 \u03c4\n\nKeeping our standard scalings for the small parameters\n\u03b3 and \u03c1,\n\u03b3 = \u01eb2 \u0393,\n\n\u03c1 = \u01eb2 R,\n\nwe choose a fractional-power scaling law for h:\nh = \u01eb3/2 H.\nThis scaling will be shown to produce a balance of damping and driving terms at the leading order in the amplitude equation. Expanding \u03c6 in powers of \u01eb1/2 ,\n\u03c6 = \u03c60 + \u01eb\u03c61 + \u01eb3/2 \u03c63/2 + \u01eb2 \u03c62 + \u01eb5/2 \u03c65/2 + . . . ,\nwhere \u03c60 = tanh X0 , and substituting in (49), we obtain\nEq.(6) for\n\u0001 \u03c61 . The partial differential equation arising at\nO \u01eb3/2 is\n1 2\nH\nD \u03c63/2 + L\u03c63/2 = ei(\u03c90 /2)T0 + c.c.\n2 0\n2\n\nThe solution \u03c63/2 to this equation has the form \u03c63/2 =\n(1/2)\n\n(1/2)\n\n\u03c63/2 ei(\u03c90 /2)T0 +c.c., where the coefficient function \u03c63/2\nsatisfies the linear nonhomogeneous equation\n\u0012\n\u0013\n3\nH\n(1/2)\nL\u2212\n\u03c63/2 = .\n8\n2\n\nSince 83 is not an eigenvalue of the operator L, this equation has a unique bounded solution. To determine it, we\nnote that two homogeneous solutions of this equation, i.e.\nsolutions of (L \u2212 3/8)y = 0, are given by Segur's formula\nyp (X0 ) =\n\n1\neipX0\n(1 + ip)(2 + ip)\n\u00d7 (2 \u2212 p2 \u2212 3ip tanh X0 \u2212 3 sech2 X0 )\n\n(50)\n\n\f9\np\nwith p = \u00b1i 13/4 [20]. Using these in the variation of\nparameters, we obtain\n(1/2)\n\n\u03c63/2 =\n\n4\n13 H(1\n\n\u2212 8 sech2 X0 ).\n\n(1/2)\n\nThe term \u03c63/2 ei(\u03c90 /2)T0 in the expansion of the wobbling kink represents the background stationary wave induced by the driver.\n\u0001\nThe equations arising at O \u01eb2 are the same as for the\nfree wobbler and the 1 : 1 parametric resonance, Eqs.(7)(8). Hence the coefficients of the harmonic components\nof \u03c62 are the same as in the undamped, undriven case.\nNamely, imposing the solvability conditions D1 V = 0\n(0)\n(2)\nand D1 A = 0, we obtain (10) for \u03c62 and (11) for \u03c62 .\n(1)\nWe also impose Eq.(15) to obtain \u03c62 = 0.\nAt the order \u01eb5/2 we have the equation\n1 2\n2 D0 \u03c65/2\n\n1\n2 th\n\nand\n\n3\n2 th\n\n(2)\n\n(2)\n\n2\n2\n16\n169 H (45X0 sech\n\nX0 \u2212 3 tanh X0\n\n\u2212 128 sech2 X0 tanh X0 ),\n\nand the one for the first harmonic component is\n(1)\n\n\u03c63 = \u2212\u22022 AX0 sech X0 tanh X0 + |A|2 Aud (X0 )\n\n(3/2)\n\n\u2212 23 i\u03c90 (\u0393 + i\u03c90 R)(3 \u2212 4 sech2 X0 ) + H 2 ue (X0 ),\n\n\u03c65/2 = HAuc (X0 ),\nrespectively. Here the functions ua , ub and uc satisfy\n\u0001\n2\n2\nL \u2212 83 ua (X0 ) = \u2212 24\n13 (1 \u2212 8 sech X0 ) sech X0 tanh X0 ,\n\u0001\n2\nL \u2212 83 ub (X0 ) = 32\n13 sech X0 tanh X0 ,\nand\n\n2\n2\nuc (X0 ) = \u2212 24\n13 (1 \u2212 8 sech X0 ) sech X0 tanh X0 .\n\nIn order to determine uc (X0 ) uniquely, we impose the\nradiation boundary conditions. (These are necessary because the value 27\n8 lies in the continuous spectrum of the\noperator L.) The functions ua and uc are even, while ub\nis odd. These three functions can be easily found by solving the above nonhomogeneous boundary-value problems\nnumerically.\nProceeding to the order \u01eb3 , we find the equation (16),\nwhere F3 is given by Eq.(17) with the term 12 Hei\u03c90 T0 \u03c60 +\nc.c. replaced with \u22123\u03c60 \u03c623/2 . The solvability conditions\nfor this equation are\nD2 V = \u22122\u0393V\n\n(3)\n\nThe function \u03c63 is calculated to be zero; the coefficient\nof the 0th harmonic is given by\n\nharmonics with\n\n(1/2)\n\n\u0001\n\n(1)\n\n+ \u03c63 e2i\u03c90 T0 + c.c. + \u03c63 e3i\u03c90 T0 + c.c.\n\n(0)\n\n\u03c65/2 = HAua (X0 ) + i\u03c90 HV ub (X0 ),\n\n27\n8\n\n(0)\n\n\u03c63 = \u03c63 + \u03c63 ei\u03c90 T0 + c.c.\n\n\u03c63 =\n\n+ L\u03c65/2 = \u22126\u03c60 \u03c61 \u03c63/2 + V D0 \u22020 \u03c63/2 .\n\nIts solution consists of the\nthe coefficient functions\n\nL\u2212\n\nequations which arises due the balance of the damping\nand driving terms). However the description provided by\nthese amplitude equations - while being qualitatively\ncorrect - turns out to be insufficiently accurate when\ncompared to numerical simulations of the full partialdifferential equation (48). (The source of this inaccuracy\nwill be clarified below.) In search of greater accuracy, we\nshall proceed to higher orders.\nThe solution of Eq.(16) has the form\n\n(51)\n\nfor the 0th harmonic, and\n60\nD2 A = \u2212\u0393A\u2212i\u03c90 RA+ 2i \u03b6\u03c90 |A|2 A\u2212 2i \u03c90 V 2 A+ 169\ni\u03c90 \u03c0H 2\n(52)\nfor the first harmonic. The latter equation includes both\nthe damping and driving terms and so the resulting master equations could be expected to capture the essentials\nof the nearly-stationary wobbling of the kink (i.e. wobbling in the vicinity of the fixed point of the amplitude\n\n(53)\n\nwhere the functions ud (X0 ) and ue (X0 ) are the bounded\nsolutions of the following nonhomogeneous equations:\n(L \u2212 23 )ud = 32 \u03b6 sech X0 tanh X0 + 6 sech X0 tanh2 X0\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u00d7 3X0 sech2 X0 \u2212 25 sech2 X0 tanh X0 \u2212 f1 (X0 ) , (54)\n(L \u2212 32 )ue = \u2212\n+\n\n2\n2\n48\n169 H tanh X0 (1 \u2212 8 sech\n180\n169 \u03c0 sech X0 tanh X0 .\n\nX0 )2\n\nSince (L \u2212 3/2) is a parity-preserving operator while\nthe right-hand sides of the above equations are given\nby odd functions, and since the homogeneous solution\nyw = sech X0 tanh X0 is also an odd function, it follows\nthat the nonhomogeneous solutions ud and ue are both\nodd. This is the only fact about ud and ue that we will\nneed in this section - we do not need to know any detail\nof these functions here. Nevertheless, we do evaluate the\nsolution ud as it will be required later on, in the study\nof the 1 : 1 directly driven kink (section VI); we evaluate\nit using the variation of parameters and numerical integration. The nonhomogeneous solution is defined up to\nthe addition of an arbitrary multiple of yw ; however this\nextra degree of freedom is fictitious as it can always be\neliminated by a suitable rescaling of \u01eb.

Solving for h we obtain an explicit expression for\nh = h1,2 (|a|2 ); the roots |a|2 are found by inverting these\nexplicit functions for each \u03c1, \u03b3 and h. The lower branch\nof the bi-quadratic is plotted in figure 3 along with results from the numerical simulations of the full PDE (48).\nWe note that, as in the 1 : 1 parametrically driven \u03c64\nequation, there is no threshold driving strength for the\nexistence of the nonzero wobbling amplitude here.\nHere it is appropriate to recall that \u03c1 and \u03b3 were\n\u0001 assumed to be of the same order while h is O \u03b3 3/4 . As\nin the case of the system (19a), the absence or presence\nof hysteresis in the dynamics depends on whether \u03c1 is\nabove or below the critical value \u03c10 (\u03b3) given by Eq.(25).\nIf the difference \u03c1 \u2212 \u03c10 is positive and of order \u03b3, there is\nonly one root |a| for each value of h. The corresponding\nfixed point is obviously stable. If, on the other hand, the\ndifference \u03c1 \u2212 \u03c10 is negative (but still of the\n\u0001 order \u03b3), we\nhave three roots |a|2 for each h = O \u03b3 3/4 in the interval\n(h+ , h\u2212 ). These roots correspond to three fixed points,\ntwo of which are stable (see Fig.3). The values h+ and\n\nand \u03b1 and \u03b2 are defined by Eq.(26b). For \u03b3 = 10\u22123\nand \u03c1 = \u22122 \u00d7 10\u22123 , the bifurcation values obtained from\nEq.(61) are h+ = 6.74 \u00d7 10\u22123 and h\u2212 = 7.78 \u00d7 10\u22123\nwhile the numerical simulations of the full PDE give 6.6\u00d7\n10\u22123 < h+ < 6.8 \u00d7 10\u22123 and 7.8 \u00d7 10\u22123 < h\u2212 < 8.0 \u00d7\n10\u22123 . For \u03c1 = \u22123 \u00d7 10\u22123 , the simulations show a more\npronounced hysteresis loop whereas for \u03c1 = \u22121 \u00d7 10\u22123 ,\nthe hysteresis was seen to disappear. (In both cases \u03b3\nwas kept at 10\u22123 .) These observations are consistent\nwith the value of \u03c10 given by the amplitude equations.\n[For \u03b3 = 10\u22123 , Eq.(25) gives \u03c10 = \u22121.1 \u00d7 10\u22123 .]\nC.\n\n1:2 Directly Driven Wobbler\n\nFinally, we produce the first several orders of the perturbation expansion for the 1 : 2 directly driven wobbling\nkink:\n\u03c6(x, t) = tanh[(1 \u2212 3|a|2 )\u03be] + a sech \u03be tanh \u03beei\u03a9t + c.c.\n\n\u2212 8 sech2 \u03be)ei(\u03a9/2)t + c.c.\n\u0011\n\u0010\n+ 2|a|2 sech2 \u03be tanh \u03be + a2 f1 (\u03be)e2i\u03a9t + c.c. + O |a|5/2 .\n+\n\n4\n13 h(1\n\n(62)\n\nWhen t is sufficiently large, the variable \u03be in this expression equals x \u2212 x0 (where x0 is a constant determined\nby the initial conditions) and a is a stable fixed point of\nthe system (58a) with v = 0 [a unique fixed point or one\nof the two stable fixed points depending on whether h is\noutside or inside the bistability interval (h+ , h\u2212 ).]\nThe interpretation of terms in (62) is the same as in the\nprevious sections. The frequency of the wobbling [where\nthe wobbling mode is given by the sum of the third and\nsecond term in the first line in (62)] is locked to double\nthe driving frequency. The term proportional to h in the\nsecond line describes a stationary wave induced by the\ndriver. As in the previous sections, the expansion (62) is\n\n\f12\nonly valid at the length scale |\u03be| = O (1). The standard\nanalysis involving outer expansions demonstrates that for\nlarger distances, we have groups of second-harmonic radiation waves moving away from the kink and leaving in\ntheir wake a sinusoidal waveform of constant amplitude.\n\nD.\n\nQualitative Analysis\n\nThe driving term h cos( \u03a92 t) is not in resonance with the\nnatural frequency of the wobbler, nor does its parity coincide with the parity of the wobbling mode. Therefore the\nability of the 1 : 2 direct driving to sustain the wobbling\nis surprising and requires a qualitative explanation.\nThe authors of [2] propose that the mechanism which\nbrings about the unexpected superharmonic resonance is\nthe coupling of the translation mode and the wobbling\nmode. Our explanation for this phenomenon is rather\ndifferent and unrelated to the translation mode. The\nway the driver affects the wobbler is by exciting an evenparity standing wave (\u03c63/2 ) at the frequency \u03a9/2 which\nthen undergoes nonlinear frequency doubling and parity transmutation through the term \u01eb3 \u03c60 \u03c623/2 in Eq.(48).\nThis latter term serves as an effective driver to the wobbling mode; it has the resonant frequency and \"correct\"\nparity.\nSince this mechanism involves a two-stage process and\nthe resulting effective driving strength is proportional to\nh2 , this type of driving produces a relatively weak response.\n\nE.\n\nChaotic Wobblers?\n\nThe authors of Ref.[2, 3] observed chaotic kink dynamics in numerical simulations of the 1 : 2 directly\ndriven wobbling kink. An indirect confirmation of\nthe existence of chaotic motions comes also from the\ncollective-coordinate approach which predicts an unbounded growth of the kink's width, energy and velocity\nat resonance [2, 3]. On the other hand, our amplitude\nequations (58) with \u03b3 6= 0 reduce to a two-dimensional\ndynamical system which can obviously not exhibit any\nchaotic attractors.\nTo find an explanation for this disagreement, we have\ncarried out a series of numerical simulations of the partial\ndifferential equation (48) at a range of driving strengths\nand damping coefficients. In all our experiments, we confined ourselves to zero detuning, \u03c1 = 0. We could not\ndetect any sign of chaotic dynamics for h smaller than\na certain minimum value, not even in the undamped\ncase. However for h greater or equal than 0.05 and sufficiently small \u03b3, our numerical simulations did reveal\nkinks performing erratic motion, where initially close profiles were seen to diverge exponentially fast. For h = 0.05,\n0.06 and 0.08, chaos was observed in simulations with \u03b3\nsmaller or equal to 10\u22123 , 2 \u00d7 10\u22123 , and 6 \u00d7 10\u22123 , respectively, whereas the same sequence of h values paired with\n\n\u03b3 = 2 \u00d7 10\u22123 , 3 \u00d7 10\u22123 and 7 \u00d7 10\u22123 , respectively, did\nnot feature any chaotic trajectories. Therefore chaotic attractors may only arise when the \u0001damping is extremely\nweak, much weaker than O h4/3 . This is the reason\nwhy the chaotic dynamics is not captured by our amplitude equations (58) which\u0001 have been derived\non the\n\u0001\nassumption that h = O \u01eb3/2 and \u03b3 = O \u01eb2 .\nThe description of chaotic motions by means of amplitude equations is a topic of future research. We expect\nour asymptotic method to remain applicable in this situation, with the appropriate adjustment of the scaling laws\nof the a and v variables and parameters of the damping\nand driving.\n1 : 1 DIRECT RESONANCE\n\nVI.\n\nA.\n\nMultiscale Expansion\n\nFinally, we explore the effect of the direct driving near\nthe natural wobbling frequency of the kink.

We shall find a nontrivial evolution equation for v, and with the above scalings, the leading-order dynamics of a and v will occur\non the same timescale. While other scalings could be investigated, the variables v and a would then change on\ndifferent timescales and so would effectively be decoupled\nfor small \u01eb. Therefore, the chosen scalings correspond to\nthe richest, three-dimensional, dynamics.

Fig.4 shows an example of\nthe kink accelerated by the 1:1 direct driving force which\nsimultaneously excites the wobbling. Note that results\nfrom the three-dimensional system (75) are in excellent\nagreement with predictions of the full partial differential\nequation - not only after the dynamics have settled to\na stationary regime but also during the transient phase.\nThe detailed analysis of the three-dimensional system\n(75) will be reported elsewhere; here, we limit ourselves\n\nto several basic observations. Firstly, it is straightforward\nto see that when h = 0, the trivial fixed point a = v = 0 is\nthe only attractor available in the system. Secondly, numerical simulations show that as h is increased for fixed\n\u03b3 and \u03c1, a nontrivial fixed point bifurcates from the point\na = v = 0 [see Fig.5 (a,b)]. For lower values of \u03c1, the bifurcation is subcritical (as in the case shown in Fig.5); for\nhigher \u03c1, it is supercritical. As h approaches some critical driving strength hc , both the |a|- and v-component\nof the nontrivial fixed point tend to infinity. Finally, in\nthe region h > hc , there are no stable fixed points. In\nthis region, simulations of the system (75) reveal a blowup regime, where the functions |a(t)|, v(t) grow without\n\n\f16\n0.25\n\n0.08\n(a)\n\n0.2\n\n0.06\n|a|\n\n0.15\n0.04\n|a|\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\n\n0.02\n\nv 0.1\n0.05\n\n0.05\n0\n\n0\n0\n0.008\n\n0.009\n\n0.01\n\n0.012\n0.01\n\n0.011\n\n0.012\n\n0.013\n\nh\n\n0\n\n0.01\n\n0.02\n\n0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05\n\n0.03\nh\n\n0.04\n\n0.05\n\n0.06\n\nFIG. 6: Results of numerical simulations of Eq.(63) with h\nraised beyond the critical value hc = 0.021.

The \"crosses\"\nare measured values from numerical simulations of the partial\ndifferential equation (63) whereas the continuous and dashed\nlines show the stable and unstable fixed points of the amplitude equations (75).\n\nbounds.\nTo determine the critical value hc , we assume that the\nblow-up regime is self-similar, that is, that the growth\nof v is pegged to that of a. This assumption can be\nformalised by expanding v and Arg(a) in powers of large\n|a|:\nv = V3 |a|3 + V1 |a| + V\u22121 |a|\u22121 + ..., (76a)\na = |a|e\u2212i\u03b8 , \u03b8 = \u03b80 + \u03b8\u22122 |a|\u22122 + \u03b8\u22124 |a|\u22124 + ....(76b)\nSubstituting these expansions in Eq.(75a) and (75b), and\nequating coefficients of like powers of |a| to zero, we can\nevaluate the coefficients Vn and \u03b8n to any order - this\njustifies the assumption.\nIn particular, setting to zero the coefficients of |a|3 in\nEq.(75a), gives\nei\u03b80 = \u2212i\n\n\u03b6\n,\n|\u03b6|\n\nV3 =\n\n2\u03c90 |\u03b6| 1\n.\n3\u03c0 h\n\n(77)\n\nOn the other hand, substituting Eqs.(76) in Eq.(75b), we\n\nget an equation describing the growth of |a(t)|:\nd\n|a| = r|a| + O(|a|\u22121 ),\ndt\nwhere the growth rate\n\u03b7e\u2212i\u03b80 + \u03b7 \u2217 ei\u03b80 h\n2\n.\nr=\u2212 \u03b3\u2212\n3\n2\nV3\nSubstituting for ei\u03b80 and V3 from (77), this becomes\n2\n3\u03c0 \u03b7e\u2212i\u03b80 + \u03b7 \u2217 ei\u03b80 2\nr=\u2212 \u03b3\u2212\nh .\n3\n2\u03c90 |\u03b6|\n2\n\n(78)\n\nThe growth of |a| is due to the h2 term in Eq.(78) which\nhas a positive coefficient; the growth is damped by the\n\u03b3 term. If we reduce h keeping \u03b3 fixed, then, at h = hc\nwhere\n\u00151/2\n\u0014\n|\u03b6|2\n8\u03c90\n\u03b3 1/2 = 0.6523\u03b3 1/2, (79)\nhc =\n9\u03c0 i(\u03b6\u03b7 \u2217 \u2212 \u03b6 \u2217 \u03b7)\nthe growth rate will become equal to zero. At this point\nthe blow-up regime is replaced by a stable fixed point\n- which, however, still has large values of |a| and v.\n[Reducing h further, the fixed point will persist but the\nsimilarity relations (76) will no longer be valid.] Note\nthat the critical value (79) does not depend on \u03c1. Numerical simulations of Eqs.(75) carried out for a variety\nof \u03b3 and \u03c1, reproduce the value of hc to high accuracy.\nAs h is increased towards hc and neither |a|- nor vcomponents of the stationary point are small any longer,\nthe system (75) ceases to provide any reliable description for the dynamics of the wobbler. A natural question\n\n\f17\nthat arises here, is what dynamical regime the kink settles to for h just below hc and for h above hc . In other\nwords, we want to know what happens when the the wobbler is driven with the small strength h of order \u03b3 1/2 [so\nthat the conditions (64) are still in place] for which our\nfinite-dimensional approximation is no longer valid. To\nanswer this, we have conducted a series of numerical simulations of Eq.(63) with h raised from h < hc to h > hc .\nThe simulations reveal that in the region inaccessible to\nour finite-dimensional approximation, the kink settles to\nwobbling with a constant amplitude which is accompanied by its translational motion with a constant velocity.\n[See Fig.6.] The numerically detected values of a and v\nare of order \u03b3 1/3 in this region; this accounts for the inadequacy of our approximation\nwhich was based on the\n\u0001\nassumptions a = O \u03b3 1/2 and v = O (\u03b3).\nThe behaviour of the 1 : 1 externally driven wobbling\nkink above (and just below) the critical value is an issue\nto which we are planning to return in the near future. To\nderive the correct set of amplitude equations, we will need\nto use our asymptotic approach with modified scalings for\na and v.\nC.\n\n1:1 Directly Driven Wobbler and Its Radiation\n\n\u0001\nUp to O \u01eb2 , the perturbation expansion gives\n\n\u0002\n\u0003 \u0002\n\u03c6(x, t) = tanh (1 \u2212 3|a|2 + 9h2 )\u03be + a sech \u03be tanh \u03be\n\u0003\n+ h(1 \u2212 2 sech2 \u03be) ei\u03a9t + c.c. + 2|a|2 sech2 \u03be tanh \u03be\n\u2212 4h(a + a\u2217 ) sech \u03be (1 + sech2 \u03be)\n\n\u2212 h2 (3 tanh \u03be + 8 sech2 \u03be tanh \u03be)\n\u0003\n\u0001\n+ a2 f1 (\u03be) + haf3 (\u03be) + h2 f4 (\u03be) e2i\u03a9t + c.c. + O |a|3 .\n(80)\n\u0002\n\nFor sufficiently large t, the variable \u03be is given by x \u2212\nvt \u2212 x0 , where x0 is determined by the initial conditions.\nThe complex constant a and the real v are components\nof a stable fixed point (trivial or nontrivial) of the system\n(75).

Substituting in the equation (65), the order \u01eb2 gives\n3\n\u03c62 = \u22133H 2 \u00b1 H 2 e2i\u03c90 T0 + c.c.\n4\n+J\u00b1 B\u00b1 ei(\u03c9\u00b1 T0 \u2212k\u00b1 X0 ) + c.c. .\n\nHere the top and bottom sign pertain to the X0 >\n0 and X0 < 0 region, respectively.\nThe amplitudes B\u00b1 are functions of the \"slow\" variables: B\u00b1 =\nB\u00b1 (X1 , ...; T1 , ...) and the normalisation coefficients J\u00b1\nhave been introduced for later convenience. Matching\nthe outer solution (81) to the inner solution (9) with coefficients as in (66), (67) and (68), and choosing J\u00b1 =\n\u00b1(2 \u2212 ik0 ), we obtain \u03c9\u00b1 = 2\u03c90 , k\u00b1 = \u00b1k0 and\n\n\u0015\n\u0014\n15\n7 2\n1 \u221e 2\nB\u00b1 (0, 0, ...; T1 , T2 , ...) = J2 A (0, 0, ...; T2 , T3 , ...) \u2212 H \u00b1 i k0 J1\u221e HA(0, 0, ...; T2 , T3 , ...).\n8\n2\n32\n\nEquations (82) are the boundary conditions for the amplitude fields B+ and B\u2212 . The equations of motion for\nthese fields are obtained at the order \u01eb3 of the outer ex(2)\npansion. Namely, the solvability conditions for \u03c63 , the\n3\ncoefficient of the second harmonic at the order \u01eb , give\nD1 B+ + c0 \u22021 B+ = 0, X1 > 0\nD1 B\u2212 \u2212 c0 \u22021 B\u2212 = 0, X1 < 0,\n\n(83a)\n(83b)\n\nwhere c0 = k0 /(2\u03c90 ).\nAs before, the analysis of the linear transport equations\n(83) under the boundary conditions (82) is straightforward. The initial condition B+ (X1 , ...; 0, ...) defined in\n\n(81)\n\n(82)\n\nX1 > 0, propagates, unchanged, to the right and the initial condition B\u2212 (X1 , ...; 0, ...) defined in X1 < 0, propagates, unchanged, to the left, both with the velocity c0 .\nIn the expanding region \u2212c0 T1 < X1 < c0 T1 , the amplitudes B\u00b1 are constants defined by the conditions (82). In\nterms of the second-harmonic radiation, this corresponds\nto two groups of radiation waves, diverging to the left\nand to the right, and leaving a sinusoidal waveform of\nconstant amplitude in between.\n\n\f18\nD.\n\nQualitative Analysis\n\nThe reason why the external force does not couple directly to the wobbling mode in the case of the 1 : 1\nexternal driving (as it did in the case of the 1 : 1 parametric resonance), is the discrepancy in the parity of the\ndriving profile and the wobbling mode. Instead, there\nare three indirect amplification mechanisms at work in\nthis case. In each of these, the central role is played\nby the even-parity standing wave excited by the driver.\nFirstly, the square of this standing wave couples to the\nwobbling mode via the term \u01eb3 \u03c631 . Secondly, the second and zeroth harmonic of the standing wave as well\nas the second-harmonic radiation excited by the standing wave couple to the wobbling mode via the term\n\u01eb3 \u03c60 \u03c61 \u03c62 . Thirdly, when the kink moves relative to the\nstanding wave, the odd-parity wobbling mode acquires\nan even parity component which then couples to the\nstanding wave. [This process is accounted for by the\nterm \u01eb3 V D0 \u22020 \u03c61 in Eq.(65).] Since the first two mechanisms rely upon a quadratic superharmonic of the induced standing wave (with the amplitude of the superharmonic being proportional to h2 ), and since the velocity of the kink (which determines the amplitude of the\neven component of the wobbling mode in the third mechanism) is small, the 1 : 1 direct resonance is weak.\nVII.\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nIn this paper, we have used the asymptotic method\nto study the wobbling kink driven by four types of resonant driving force, viz., the 1 : 1 and 2 : 1 parametric,\nand 1 : 2 and 1 : 1 external driving. We have demonstrated the existence of resonance (i.e. the existence\nof sustained wobbling with nondecaying amplitude despite losing energy to radiation and dissipation) in all\nfour cases. This conclusion (verified in direct numerical simulations of the corresponding partial differential\nequation) agrees with results of Quintero, S\u00e1nchez and\nMertens who also demonstrated the existence of the resonance in the 1 : 1 parametrically and 1 : 2 directly\ndriven \u03c64 equation [2, 3, 4]. However, we are in disagreement with these authors on the 1 : 1 directly driven,\ndamped equation. Namely, our method does capture the\nresonance in this case whereas their collective coordinate\napproach does not. (In fairness to the pioneering work\nof Quintero, S\u00e1nchez and Mertens, their direct numerical\nsimulations did reveal a resonant peak at the frequency\nof the driver equal to the natural wobbling frequency of\nthe kink - an experimental result which, however, did\nnot reconcile with their collective coordinate predictions\n[2, 3].)\nIn each of the four driving regimes that we have considered in this paper, we have derived a system of equations\nfor the complex amplitude of the wobbling coupled to\nthe velocity of the kink. The predictions based on this\ndynamical system are in agreement with results of the\n\ndirect numerical simulation of the full partial differential\nequation. In three out of four cases considered, the velocity of the kink is shown to decay to zero as time advances,\nas a result of which the dimension of this dynamical system reduces from 3 to 2. Only in one case (the case of\nthe 1 : 1 directly driven wobbler) does the velocity of the\nkink not necessarily decay to zero. In this latter case the\nwobbling of the kink is accompanied by its motion with\nnonzero velocity.\nEach of the four dynamical systems derived here give\nrise to a bifurcation diagram featuring bistability and\nhysteretical transitions in the wobbling amplitude. In the\n1 : 1 parametric and 1 : 2 direct resonances, the bistability is between two nonzero values of the wobbling amplitude, whereas in the 2 : 1 parametrically and 1 : 1 directly driven \u03c64 equations, one of the two stable regimes\ninvolves a nonzero and the other one a zero amplitude.\nIt is fitting to note here that the collective coordinate\napproach [2, 3, 4] does not capture the bistability and\nhysteresis.\nIn section IV, we ranked the two parametric resonances\naccording to the amplitude of the stationary wobbling resulting from the driving with a certain reference strength,\nh. Adding to this hierarchy the two direct resonances\nproduces the following ranking. The 1 : 1 parametric\nresonance is the strongest of the four cases; in this case\nthe amplitude of the stationary wobbling, a, is of the\norder h1/3 . The 2 : 1 parametric resonance is second\nstrongest; in this case the kink responds with the wobbling amplitude a \u223c h1/2 . The 1 : 2 direct resonance has\na \u223c h2/3 and the 1 : 1 direct resonance is the weakest:\na \u223c h. (The fact that the harmonic direct resonance is\nweaker than the superharmonic one, is in agreement with\nresults of [2, 3] where it was established in the undamped\nsituation.)\nOur asymptotic approach also allows to rank the resonances according to the widths of the corresponding\nArnold tongues on the \"driving strength vs driving frequency\" plane. The 1 : 1 parametric resonance is the\nwidest one; in this case the resonant region is bounded\nby the curve h \u223c \u03c13/2 . The 2 : 1 parametric resonance is\nsecond widest; in this case the Arnold tongue has h \u223c \u03c1.\nThe 1 : 2 direct resonance has h \u223c \u03c13/4 and the 1 : 1\ndirect resonance is the narrowest: h \u223c \u03c11/2 . We should\nalso mention that the 1 : 1 parametric and the 1 : 2 direct resonance have no threshold in the strength of the\ndriver whereas the 2 : 1 parametric and 1 : 1 direct resonances occur only if the driving strength exceeds a certain\nthreshold value.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank Alan Champneys for useful remarks.
