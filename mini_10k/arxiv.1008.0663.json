Let G be one of the Ricci-flat holonomy groups SU (n), Sp(n), Spin(7) or G2 , and\nM a compact manifold of dimension 2n, 4n, 8 or 7, respectively. We prove that the natural\nmap from the moduli space of torsion-free G-structures on M to the moduli space of Ricci-flat\nmetrics is open, and that the image is a smooth manifold. For the exceptional cases G = Spin(7)\nand G2 we extend the result to asymptotically cylindrical manifolds.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe possible holonomy groups of simply-connected non-symmetric irreducible Riemannian manifolds were classified by Berger [1]. 'Berger's list' contains several infinite families, and the two\nexceptional cases Spin(7) and G2 , appearing as the holonomy of manifolds of dimension 8 and\n7 respectively. In many cases, an effective approach to studying G-metrics (by which we mean\nmetrics with holonomy contained in G) is to define them in terms of certain closed differential\nforms, equivalent to torsion-free G-structures. A G-structure defines a Riemannian metric, and\nif its torsion vanishes (which is a first-order differential equation) then the induced metric has\nholonomy contained in G. For G = SU (n), Sp(n), Spin(7) or G2 we define a G-manifold to be a\nconnected oriented manifold of dimension 2n, 4n, 8 or 7 respectively, equipped with a torsion-free\nG-structure and the associated Riemannian metric.\nG-metrics are Ricci-flat for G = SU (n), Sp(n), Spin(7) or G2 . For compact manifolds M.Y.\nWang [22, Theorem 3.1] proved a local converse: any small Ricci-flat deformation of a G-metric\nstill has holonomy contained in G. In other words, the moduli space WG of G-metrics is an open\nsubset of the moduli space W0 of Ricci-flat metrics. This is an analogue of a result of Koiso [10]\non deformations of K\u00e4hler-Einstein metrics. Wang proves the result case by case, but asks if there\nis a general proof.\nIn this paper we observe that the problem can be reduced in a uniform way to showing unobstructedness for deformations of torsion-free G-structures. This has in turn been given a uniform\ntreatment by Goto [7]. As part of the proof we provide a clear summary of the deformation theory\nof Ricci-flat metrics on a compact manifold (a special case of deformation theory for Einstein\nmetrics used by Koiso [10]). This treatment makes it easier to extend the results to other types of\ncomplete manifolds, and we will discuss the asymptotically cylindrical case in some detail.\nIf M is a compact G-manifold then the group D of diffeomorphisms of M isotopic to the identity\nacts on the space of torsion-free G-structures by pull-backs. The resulting quotient is the moduli\nspace MG of torsion-free G-structures on M , and is known to be a manifold. This is due to Tian\n[19] and Todorov [20] in the Calabi-Yau (G = SU (n)) case, and Joyce in the exceptional cases (see\n[9, \u00a710.4, 10.7]). D also acts on the space of Riemannian metrics, and we let WG and W0 denote\nthe moduli spaces of G-metrics and Ricci-flat metrics respectively. In \u00a73 we prove\nTheorem I. Let G = SU (n), Sp(n), Spin(7) or G2 , and let M be a compact G-manifold. Then\nWG is open in W0 . Moreover, WG is a smooth manifold and the natural map\nm : M G \u2192 WG\nthat sends a torsion-free G-structure to the metric it defines is a submersion.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 53C25.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nJOHANNES NORDSTR\u00d6M\n\nRemark 1.1. It is easy to see that WG is also closed in W0 , so it is a union of connected components.\nIt seems to be an open problem whether there exist any compact Ricci-flat manifolds without a\nholonomy reduction.\nRemark 1.2. The quotient of the space of G-metrics by the group of all diffeomorphisms of M\n(not just the ones isotopic to the identity) is a quotient of WG with discrete fibres and in general\nan orbifold (cf. remark 3.11).\nThe case G = G2 of theorem I was proved by M.Y. Wang [22, Theorem 3.1B]. For G = Sp(n)\nor Spin(7), Wang showed that WG \u2286 W0 is open (so the statement of theorem I is stronger).\nManifolds with holonomy in SU (n) are Calabi-Yau manifolds, i.e. Ricci-flat K\u00e4hler manifolds.\nThe case G = SU (n) of theorem I is therefore a special case of a more general result by Koiso on\nEinstein deformations of K\u00e4hler-Einstein metrics.\nLet X 2n be a compact K\u00e4hler-Einstein manifold. Koiso [10, Theorem 0.7] shows that if the\nEinstein constant e (equivalently the first Chern class c1 (X)) is non-positive and the complex\ndeformations of X are unobstructed, then any small Einstein deformation of the metric is K\u00e4hler\nwith respect to some perturbed complex structure. In other words, the map from the moduli space\nof K\u00e4hler-Einstein structures to the moduli space of Einstein metrics is open (see e.g. [2, \u00a712J] for\na discussion). The proof shows that near any K\u00e4hler-Einstein metric there is a smooth pre-moduli\nspace of Einstein metrics, so that the moduli space of K\u00e4hler-Einstein metrics is an orbifold. Tian\n[19] and Todorov [20] show that on a compact Calabi-Yau manifold the obstructions to the complex\ndeformations vanish. Hence theorem I for G = SU (n) follows from Koiso's theorem, except for the\nclaim that WSU(n) is smooth (and not just an orbifold).\nRemark 1.3. Dai, X. Wang and Wei [5] use the fact that WG is open in W to deduce that any\nscalar-flat deformation of a Ricci-flat G-metric on a compact manifold remains a G-metric.\nThe proof of theorem I given in \u00a73 is a simplification of Wang's argument for the case G = G2 .\nFirst, we observe that the point-wise surjectivity of the derivative of m follows from a well-known\nproperty of Laplacians on manifolds with reduced holonomy noted by Chern [4]. This makes it\neasy to see that the proof applies also for the other Ricci-flat holonomy groups, provided that\nthe deformations of torsion-free G-structures are unobstructed. Second, we streamline some parts\nof the deformation theory for Ricci-flat metrics. This makes it easier to generalise the result to\ncertain non-compact settings.\nOne relevant type of complete non-compact Riemannian manifolds are exponentially asymptotically cylindrical (EAC) ones (defined in \u00a72.7). In \u00a73.5 we explain that the necessary deformation\ntheory for Ricci-flat metrics and (at least when G = Spin(7) or G2 ) torsion-free G-structures\ncarries over to the EAC case, so that there are smooth moduli spaces MG and W0 of torsion-free\nEAC G-structures and Ricci-flat EAC metrics on an EAC G-manifold M .\nTheorem I\u2032 . Let G = Spin(7) or G2 , and M an EAC G-manifold. Then WG is open in W0 .\nMoreover, WG is a smooth manifold and the natural map\nm : M G \u2192 WG\nis a submersion.\nIn [11] Kovalev proves the analogous result for EAC Calabi-Yau manifolds, by an extension\nof Koiso's arguments for the compact K\u00e4hler-Einstein case. The discussion in subsection 3.5 of\ndeformations of EAC Ricci-flat metrics is similar to that in [11], while the necessary results on\ndeformations of EAC G-structures are taken from [17].\nRemark 1.4. One may consider the structure of the map m in greater detail. For the exceptional\ncases G = G2 and Spin(7), one can use the characterisation of torsion-free G-structures in terms\nof parallel spinors (cf. M.Y. Wang [21]) to show that m is a diffeomorphism if the holonomy of\nM is exactly G for any G-metric (this depends only on the topology of M ), and that MG is in\ngeneral a disjoint union of fibre bundles over WG with real projective plane fibres (the components\ncorrspond to different spin structures on M ). See [16, \u00a75.3] for details. For Calabi-Yau manifolds,\n[2, Theorem 12.103] states that the moduli space of Calabi-Yau structures on a compact manifold\n\n\fRICCI-FLAT DEFORMATIONS OF METRICS WITH EXCEPTIONAL HOLONOMY\n\n3\n\nis a locally trivial fibration with compact fibres over the moduli space of Calabi-Yau metrics (but\ndoes not describe the fibres further).\nAcknowledgements. I am grateful to Alexei Kovalev for many helpful discussions.\n2. Preliminaries\nWe describe how a metric with holonomy G = Spin(7), G2 , SU (n) or Sp(n) can be defined in\nterms of a torsion-free G-structure. This is a set of differential forms, that are both parallel and\nharmonic. For more background on manifolds with special holonomy see e.g. Joyce [9] or Salamon\n[18].\n2.1. Holonomy. We define the holonomy group of a Riemannian manifold. For a fuller discussion\nof holonomy see e.g. [9, Chapter 2].\nDefinition 2.1. Let M n be a manifold with a Riemannian metric g. If x \u2208 M and \u03b3 is a closed\npiecewise C 1 loop in M based at x then the parallel transport around \u03b3 (with respect to the\nLevi-Civita connection) defines an orthogonal linear map P\u03b3 : Tx M \u2192 Tx M . The holonomy group\nHol(g, x) \u2286 O(Tx M ) at x is the group generated by {P\u03b3 : \u03b3 is a closed loop based at x}.\nIf x, y \u2208 M and \u03c4 is a path from x to y we can define a group isomorphism Hol(g, x) \u2192 Hol(g, y)\nby P\u03b3 7\u2192 P\u03c4 \u25e6 P\u03b3 \u25e6 P\u03c4\u22121 . Provided that M is connected we can therefore identify Hol(g, x) with\na subgroup of O(n), independently of x up to conjugacy, and talk simply of the holonomy group\nof g.\nThere is a correspondence between tensors fixed by the holonomy group and parallel tensor\nfields on the manifold.\nProposition 2.2 ([9, Proposition 2.5.2]). Let M n be a Riemannian manifold, x \u2208 M and E a\nvector bundle on M associated to T M . If s is a parallel section of E then s(x) is preserved by\nHol(g, x). Conversely if s0 \u2208 Ex is preserved by Hol(g, x) then there is a parallel section s of E\nsuch that s(x) = s0 .\nDefinition 2.3. Let M n a manifold and G \u2286 O(n) a closed subgroup. A G-metric on M is a\nmetric with holonomy contained in G.\n2.2. Spin(7)-structures. The stabiliser in GL(R8 ) of\n\u03c80 = dx1234 + dx1256 + dx1278 + dx1357 \u2212 dx1368 \u2212 dx1458 \u2212 dx1467 \u2212\ndx2358 \u2212 dx2367 \u2212 dx2457 + dx2468 + dx3456 + dx3478 + dx5678 \u2208 \u039b4 (R8 )\u2217\n\n(1)\n\nis Spin(7) (identified with a subgroup of SO(8) by the spin representation). For an oriented vector\nspace V of dimension 8 let \u039bSpin(7) V \u2217 \u2282 \u039b4 V \u2217 be the subset of forms equivalent to \u03c80 under some\noriented linear isomorphism V \u223c\n= R8 . A Spin(7)-structure on an oriented manifold M 8 is a section\n\u2217\nof the subbundle \u039bSpin(7) T M \u2282 \u039b4 T \u2217 M . Since Spin(7) \u2282 SO(8) a Spin(7)-structure \u03c8 naturally\ndefines a Riemannian metric g\u03c8 on M . Note that \u03c8 is self-dual with respect to this metric.\nWe make a note of the decomposition of \u039b4 R8 into irreducible representations of Spin(7).\nFirstly it splits into the self-dual and anti-self-dual parts \u039b4\u00b1 R8 . We let \u039b4d R8 denote an irreducible\ncomponent of rank d. Then\n\u039b4+ R8 = \u039b41 R8 \u2295 \u039b47 R8 \u2295 \u039b427 R8 ,\n\u039b4\u2212 R8\n\n=\n\n\u039b435 R8 .\n\n(2a)\n(2b)\n\nThe tangent space at \u03c8 to the space of Spin(7)-structures \u0393(\u039bSpin(7) T \u2217 M ) is \u0393(E\u03c8 ), where\nE\u03c8 \u2282 \u039b4 T \u2217 M is a Spin(7)-invariant linear subbundle. More precisely, the Spin(7)-structure \u03c8\ndetermines a decomposition of \u039b4 T \u2217 M modelled on (2), and E\u03c8 = \u039b41\u22957\u229535 T \u2217 M .\nA Spin(7)-structure \u03c8 is torsion-free if it is parallel with respect to the metric it induces.\nIt follows immediately from proposition 2.2 that a metric g on M 8 has holonomy contained in\nSpin(7) if and only if it is induced by a torsion-free Spin(7)-structures.\n\n\f4\n\nJOHANNES NORDSTR\u00d6M\n\nThe condition that Hol(g) \u2286 Spin(7) imposes algebraic constraints on the curvature of g. In\nparticular any Spin(7)-metric is Ricci-flat (see [18, Corollary 12.6]). The torsion-free condition for\n\u03c8 can usefully be rewritten as d\u03c8 = 0 (see [18, Lemma 12.4]).\n2.3. G2 -structures. Recall that G2 can be defined as the automorphism group of the normed\nalgebra of octonions. Equivalently, G2 is the stabiliser in GL(R7 ) of\n\u03c60 = dx123 + dx145 + dx167 + dx246 \u2212 dx257 \u2212 dx347 \u2212 dx356 \u2208 \u039b3 (R7 )\u2217 .\n3\n\n\u2217\n\n(3)\n\n\u2217\n\nFor an oriented vector space V of dimension 7 let \u039bG2 V \u2282 \u039b V be the subset consisting of\nforms equivalent to \u03c60 under some oriented linear isomorphism V \u223c\n= R7 . A G2 -structure on an\n\u2217\n7\noriented manifold M is a section \u03c6 of the subbundle \u039bG2 T M \u2282 \u039b3 T \u2217 M , and naturally defines\na Riemannian metric g\u03c6 on M .\nThe typical fibre of \u039bG2 T \u2217 M is isomorphic to GL(R7 )/G2 , so by dimension-counting \u039bG2 T \u2217 M\nis an open subbundle of \u039b3 T \u2217 M . Thus the tangent space at \u03c6 to the space of G2 -structures\n\u0393(\u039bG2 T \u2217 M ) is \u03a93 (M ) = \u0393(E\u03c6 ), if we let E\u03c6 = \u039b3 T \u2217 M .\nA G2 -structure \u03c6 is torsion-free if it is parallel with respect to the metric it induces. A metric\ng on M 7 has holonomy contained in G2 if and only if it is induced by a torsion-free G2 -structure.\nG2 -metrics are Ricci-flat (see [18, Proposition 11.8]). As observed by Gray, a G2 -structure \u03c6 is\ntorsion-free if and only if d\u03c6 = 0 and d\u2217\u03c6 \u03c6 = 0 (where the codifferential d\u2217\u03c6 is defined using the\nmetric induced by \u03c6, see [18, Lemma 11.5]).\n2.4. SU (n)-structures. Let z k = x2k\u22121 +ix2k be complex coordinates on R2n .

An\n2n\nSU (n)-structure on an oriented manifold M is a section (\u03a9, \u03c9) of the subbundle \u039bSU(n) T \u2217 M \u2282\n\u039bn TC\u2217 M \u2295 \u039b2 T \u2217 M . It naturally defines an almost complex structure and a Riemannian metric\nn(n\u22121)\non M , such that \u03a9 has type (n, 0). The volume form on V is given by both (\u22121) 2 ( 2i )n \u03a9 \u2227 \u03a9\u0304\n1 n\nand n!\n\u03c9 (cf. Hitchin [8, \u00a72]).\nAn SU (n)-structure is torsion-free if it is parallel with respect to the metric it induces, and\na metric on M 2n has holonomy contained in SU (n) if and only if it is induced by a torsion-free\nSU (n)-structure.\n(\u03a9, \u03c9) is torsion-free if and only if d\u03a9 = d\u03c9 = 0. Then the induced almost complex structure is\nintegrable, the Riemannian metric is a Ricci-flat K\u00e4hler metric, and \u03a9 is a holomorphic (n, 0)-form.\nM 2n equipped with a torsion-free SU (n)-structure is called an SU (n)-manifold or Calabi-Yau\nn-fold.\n2.5. Sp(n)-structures. Let q k = x4k\u22123 + ix4k\u22122 + jx4k\u22121 + kx4k be quaternionic coordinates\non R4n . Then we may write\ndq 1 \u2227 dq\u0304 1 + * * * + dq n \u2227 dq\u0304 n = \u22122(i\u03c90I + j\u03c90J + k\u03c90K ),\nwith \u03c90I , \u03c90J , \u03c90K \u2208 \u039b2 (R4n )\u2217 . The stabiliser in GL(R4n ) of this triple of 2-forms is Sp(n). For an\noriented real vector space V of dimension 4n let \u039bSp(n) V \u2217 \u2282 (\u039b2 V \u2217 )\u22973 be the subset of triples\n(\u03c9 I , \u03c9 J , \u03c9 K ) equivalent to (\u03c90I , \u03c90J , \u03c90K ) under some oriented isomorphism V \u223c\n= R4n . An Sp(n)4n\n\u2217\nstructure on an oriented manifold M is a section of the subbundle \u039bSp(n) T M \u2282 (\u039b2 T \u2217 M )\u22973 .\nIt is torsion-free if it is parallel with respect to the induced metric, and a metric on M 4n has\nholonomy contained in Sp(n) if and only if it is induced by a torsion-free Sp(n)-structure.\nEquivalently, (\u03c9 I , \u03c9 J , \u03c9 K ) is torsion-free if and only if d\u03c9 I = d\u03c9 J = d\u03c9 K = 0. Then the metric\nof M is Ricci-flat, and M has a triple I, J, K of anti-commuting integrable complex structures,\nsuch that \u03c9 I is the K\u00e4hler form and \u03c9 J +i\u03c9 K a holomorphic (2, 0)-form with respect to I, etc. M 4n\nequipped with a torsion-free Sp(n)-structure is called an Sp(n)-manifold or hyperK\u00e4hler manifold.\n\n\fRICCI-FLAT DEFORMATIONS OF METRICS WITH EXCEPTIONAL HOLONOMY\n\n5\n\n2.6. Laplacians. For a Riemannian manifold with holonomy H one can define a Lichnerowicz\nLaplacian on vector bundles associated to the H-structure. On differential forms this agrees with\nthe usual Hodge Laplacian, as is explained in Besse [2, \u00a71I]. This can be used to define decompositions of the spaces of harmonic forms analogous to the K\u00e4hler decomposition on a K\u00e4hler\nmanifold, as observed by Chern [4].\nSuppose a Riemannian manifold M n has holonomy group Hol(M ) \u2286 H (where H is a closed\nsubgroup of O(n)), and a corresponding H-structure. Let \u03c1 : H \u2192 GL(E) be a representation\nof H, and E\u03c1 the corresponding associated vector bundle. Let had be the vector bundle induced\nby the adjoint representation. had can be identified with a subbundle of \u039b2 T \u2217 M , and because\nHol(M ) \u2286 H the Riemannian curvature tensor R is a (symmetric) section of had \u2297 had . We use\nthe Lie algebra representation D\u03c1 : h \u2192 End(E) to define\n(D\u03c1)2 : h \u2297 h \u2192 End(E), a \u2297 b 7\u2192 D\u03c1(a) \u25e6 D\u03c1(b).\nThis induces a bundle map had \u2297 had \u2192 End(E\u03c1 ). The symmetry of R implies that (D\u03c1)2 (R) is a\nself-adjoint section of End(E\u03c1 ).\nDefinition 2.4. Let M be a Riemannian manifold with Hol(M ) \u2286 H and \u03c1 a representation of H.\nThe Lichnerowicz Laplacian on the associated vector bundle E\u03c1 is the elliptic formally self-adjoint\noperator\n\u25b3\u03c1 = \u2207\u2217 \u2207 \u2212 2(D\u03c1)2 (R) : \u0393(E\u03c1 ) \u2192 \u0393(E\u03c1 ),\nwhere \u2207 is the connection on E\u03c1 induced by the Levi-Civita connection on M .\nLemma 2.5. Let M n be a Riemannian manifold. The Lichnerowicz Laplacian corresponding to\nthe standard representation of O(n) on \u039bm (Rn )\u2217 is the usual Hodge Laplacian \u25b3 on \u039bm T \u2217 M .\nProof. See [2, Equation (1.154)].\n\n\u0003\n\nLemma 2.6 (cf. [9, Theorem 3.5.3]). Let M be a Riemannian manifold with Hol(M ) \u2286 H\nand \u03c6 : E \u2192 F an equivariant map of H-representations (E, \u03c1), (F, \u03c3). \u03c6 induces a bundle map\nE\u03c1 \u2192 F\u03c3 , and the diagram below commutes.\n\u0393(E\u03c1 )\n\n\u03c6\u2732\n\n\u25b3\u03c1\n\u2744\n\u0393(E\u03c1 )\n\n\u0393(F\u03c3 )\n\u25b3\u03c3\n\n\u03c6\u2732\n\n\u2744\n\u0393(F\u03c3 )\n\nIn particular, if \u03c11 , \u03c12 are H-representations then \u25b3\u03c11 \u2295\u03c12 = \u25b3\u03c11 \u2295 \u25b3\u03c12 .\nProof. Clear from the fact that the Lichnerowicz Laplacian is defined naturally by the representations.\n\u0003\nSuppose that \u039bm (Rn )\u2217 splits as a direct sum of representations of H. On a manifold M with holonomy contained in H there is a corresponding splitting of \u039bm T \u2217 M into H-invariant subbundles.\nLemma 2.6 implies that the Hodge Laplacian commutes with the projections to the subbundles.\nHence there is also a decomposition for the harmonic forms (see [9, Theorem 3.5.3]).\n2.7. Asymptotically cylindrical manifolds. A non-compact manifold M is said to have cylindrical ends if M is written as union of two pieces M0 and M\u221e with common boundary X, where\nM0 is compact, and M\u221e is identified with X \u00d7 R+ by a diffeomorphism (identifying \u2202M\u221e with\nX \u00d7 {0}). X is called the cross-section of M . Let t be a smooth real function on M which is the\nR+ -coordinate on M\u221e , and negative on the interior of M0 . A tensor field s on M is said to be exponentially asymptotic with rate \u03b4 > 0 to a translation-invariant tensor s\u221e on M if e\u03b4t k\u2207k (s \u2212 s\u221e )k\nis bounded on M\u221e for all k \u2265 0, with respect to a norm defined by an arbitrary Riemannian\nmetric on X.\n\n\f6\n\nJOHANNES NORDSTR\u00d6M\n\nA metric on M is called EAC (exponentially asymptotically cylindrical) if it is exponentially\nasymptotic to a product metric on X \u00d7R. Similarly a G-structure is said to be EAC if it is exponentially asymptotic to a translation-invariant G-structure on X \u00d7 R which defines a product metric.\nA diffeomorphism \u03c6 of M is called EAC if it is exponentially close to a product diffeomorphism\n(x, t) 7\u2192 (\u039e(x), t + h) of X \u00d7 R in a similar exponential sense.\nRemark 2.7. If an EAC metric has reduced holonomy then so does the induced metric on the crosssection. In particular, the cross-section of an EAC Spin(7)-manifold is a compact G2 -manifold,\nand the cross-section of an EAC G2 -manifold is a Calabi-Yau 3-fold.\nOn an asymptotically cylindrical manifold M it is useful to introduce weighted H\u00f6lder norms.\nLet E be a vector bundle on M associated to the tangent bundle, k \u2265 0, \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1) and \u03b4 \u2208 R. We\ndefine the C\u03b4k,\u03b1 -norm of a section s of E in terms of the usual H\u00f6lder norm by\nkskC k,\u03b1 = ke\u03b4t skC k,\u03b1 .\n\u03b4\n\n(5)\n\nDenote the space of sections of E with finite C\u03b4k,\u03b1 -norm by C\u03b4k,\u03b1 (E). Up to Lipschitz equivalence\nthe weighted norms are independent of the choice of asymptotically cylindrical metric, and of the\nchoice of t on the compact piece M0 . In particular, the topological vector spaces C\u03b4k,\u03b1 (E) are\nindependent of these choices.\nThe main importance of the weighted norms is that elliptic asymptotically translation-invariant\noperators acts as Fredholm operators on the weighted spaces of sections. In particular, this applies\nto the Hodge Laplacian of an EAC metric.\nTheorem 2.8. Let M be an asymptotically cylindrical manifold. If \u03b4 > 0 with \u03b4 2 smaller than\nany positive eigenvalue of the Laplacian on X then\nk+2,\u03b1\nk,\u03b1\n\u25b3 : C\u00b1\u03b4\n(\u039bm T \u2217 M ) \u2192 C\u00b1\u03b4\n(\u039bm T \u2217 M )\n\nis Fredholm for all m. The index of (6) is \u2213(b\n\nm\u22121\n\n(6)\n\nm\n\n(X) + b (X)).\n\nProof. The Fredholm result is a special case of Lockhart and McOwen [13, Theorem 6.2], while\nthe index formula can be found in Lockhart [12, \u00a73] (or Melrose [14, \u00a76.4]).\n\u0003\nThis can be used to deduce results analogous to Hodge theory for compact manifolds. Let\nm\nH0m denote the space of bounded harmonic m-forms on M , and H\u221e\nthe translation-invariant\nm\u22121\nm\nm\nm\nharmonic forms on X \u00d7 R. H\u221e = HX \u2295 dt \u2227 HX , where HX are the harmonic forms on X. Any\nm\n\u03c6 \u2208 H0m is asymptotically translation-invariant; let B(\u03c6) \u2208 H\u221e\ndenote its limit. We can write\nm\u22121\nm\nB(\u03c6) = Ba (\u03c6) + dt \u2227 Be (\u03c6) \u2208 HX \u2295 dt \u2227 HX . Then\nm\nm\nH0m = Habs\n\u2295 HE\n,\nm\u22121\nm\nm\n, and HE\n\u2282 H0m is the subspace of exact forms.\nis the kernel of Be : H0m \u2192 HX\nwhere Habs\nm\nTheorem 2.9. Let M be an EAC manifold. The natural map Habs\n\u2192 H m (M ) is an isomorphism.\nm\nm\n(M ) \u2192 H m (M ) induced\nDually HE\nis isomorphic to the kernel of the homomorphism e : Hcpt\n\u2217\n\u2217\nby the natural chain inclusion \u03a9cpt (M ) \u2192 \u03a9 (M ). If M has a single end (i.e. the cross-section\nX is connected) then the long exact sequence for relative cohomology of (M, X) shows that\n1\ne : Hcpt\n(M ) \u2192 H 1 (M ) is injective. Hence\n\nCorollary 2.10. Let M n be an asymptotically cylindrical manifold which has a single end (i.e.\n1\nthe cross-section X is connected). Then HE\n= 0, and H01 \u2192 H 1 (M ) is an isomorphism.\n3. Ricci-flat deformations of G-metrics\n3.1. Deformations of G-metrics. Let G be one of the Ricci-flat holonomy groups SU (n), Sp(n),\nSpin(7) or G2 , and M a compact G-manifold. We explained in \u00a72 how a G-metric on a manifold M\nof the appropriate dimension can be defined in terms of a G-structure, i.e. a section of a subbundle\n\u039bG T \u2217 M \u2282 \u039b\u2217 T \u2217 M , which is torsion-free and in particular closed. In order to prove theorem I\nwe will use that deformations of G-structures are unobstructed, and the existence of pre-moduli\nspaces.\n\n\fRICCI-FLAT DEFORMATIONS OF METRICS WITH EXCEPTIONAL HOLONOMY\n\n7\n\nThe tangent space to \u0393(\u039bG T \u2217 M ) at a G-structure \u03c7 consists of the sections of the bundle of\npoint-wise tangents to \u039bG T \u2217 M at \u03c7, which is a vector bundle E\u03c7 \u2286 \u039b\u2217 T \u2217 M associated to the\nG-structure. E\u03c7 is a bundle of forms, so the Hodge Laplacian acts on \u0393(E\u03c7 ). When \u03c7 is torsion-free\nthis is the same as the Lichnerowicz Laplacian from \u00a72.6.\nThe group D of diffeomorphisms of M isotopic to the identity acts on the space of torsion-free\nG-structures by pull-backs and the quotient is the moduli space MG of torsion-free G-structures.\nGoto [7] proves that the deformations of torsion-free G-structures are unobstructed in the following\nsense:\nProposition 3.1. Let G = SU (n), Sp(n), Spin(7) or G2 , M a compact G-manifold, and \u03c7 a\ntorsion-free G-structure on M . Then there is a submanifold R of the space of C 1 G-structures\nsuch that\n(i) the elements of R are smooth torsion-free G-structures,\n(ii) the tangent space to R at \u03c7 is the space of harmonic sections of E\u03c7 ,\n(iii) the natural map R \u2192 MG is a homeomorphism onto a neighbourhood of \u03c7D in MG .\nThe spaces R are pre-moduli spaces of torsion-free G-structures and can be used as coordinate\ncharts for MG , which is thus a smooth manifold. The pre-moduli space R near \u03c7 can be chosen\nto be invariant under the stabiliser \u03c7. In fact\nProposition 3.2. Let \u03c7 \u2208 X , and let I\u03c7 \u2286 D be the stabiliser of \u03c7. If R is I\u03c7 -invariant and\nsmall enough then Ix acts trivially on R and I\u03c7\u2032 = Ix for all \u03c7\u2032 \u2208 R.\nProof. Because the tangent space to R consists of harmonic forms, a neighbourhood of \u03c7 can be\nimmersed in (a direct sum of copies of) the de Rham cohomology of M . Because elements of I\u03c7\nact trivially on cohomology they must fix such a neighbourhood. The reverse inclusion I\u03c7\u2032 \u2286 I\u03c7\nfollows from [6, Theorem 7.1(2)].\n\u0003\n3.2. Killing vector fields. Before we discuss the deformations of Ricci-flat metrics we make\nsome remarks about Killing vector fields. These are the infinitesimal isometries of a Riemannian\nmanifold (M, g), i.e. vector fields V such that the Lie derivative LV g vanishes.\nDefinition 3.3. Given a metric g on M let \u03b4 \u2217 : \u03a91 (M ) \u2192 \u0393(S 2 (T \u2217 M )) be the symmetric part of\nthe Levi-Civita connection \u2207 : \u03a91 (M ) \u2192 \u0393(T \u2217 M \u2297 T \u2217 M ).\nThe formal adjoint \u03b4 of \u03b4 \u2217 is the restriction of \u2207\u2217 : \u0393(T \u2217 M \u2297 T \u2217 M ) \u2192 \u03a91 (M ) to the symmetric\npart \u0393(S 2 (T \u2217 M )).\nProposition 3.4 ([2, Lemma 1.60]). Let g be a Riemannian metric on a manifold M and V a\nvector field. Then LV g = 2\u03b4 \u2217 V \u266d , where V \u266d denotes the 1-form g(V, *).\nThe second Bianchi identity implies that\n(2\u03b4 + d tr)Ric = 0\n\n(7)\n\nfor any Riemannian metric. The operator 2\u03b4 + d tr is sometimes called the Bianchi operator, and\nit also satisfies the following useful identity.\nLemma 3.5 ([11, Equation (14)]). If (M, g) is a Ricci-flat manifold then\n(2\u03b4 + d tr)\u03b4 \u2217 = \u25b3.\nProof. The anti-symmetric part of \u2207 on \u03a91 (M ) is 21 d, so \u03b4 \u2217 = \u2207 \u2212 21 d. Also tr \u03b4 \u2217 = d\u2217 on \u03a91 (M ).\nUsing the Weitzenb\u00f6ck formula \u25b3 = \u2207\u2217 \u2207 \u2212 Ric we obtain\n(2\u03b4 + d tr)\u03b4 \u2217 = 2\u2207\u2217 \u2207 \u2212 \u2207\u2217 d + d tr \u03b4 \u2217 = 2\u2207\u2217 \u2207 \u2212 d\u2217 d \u2212 dd\u2217 = \u25b3.\n\n\u0003\n\nProposition 3.6. Let (M, g) be a Ricci-flat manifold. If V is a Killing field then the 1-form V \u266d\nis harmonic. If M is compact then the converse also holds.\nProof. \u03b4 \u2217 V \u266d = 0 \u21d2 \u25b3V \u266d = 0 by lemma 3.5. Trivially \u2207V \u266d = 0 \u21d2 \u03b4 \u2217 V \u266d = 0, and if M is compact\nthen \u25b3V \u266d = \u2207\u2217 \u2207V \u266d = 0 \u21d2 \u2207V \u266d = 0 by integration by parts.\n\u0003\nThis implies that, for any of the Ricci-flat holonomy groups G, the space of infinitesimal automorphisms of a compact G-manifold is (H1 )\u266f .\n\n\f8\n\nJOHANNES NORDSTR\u00d6M\n\n3.3. Deformations of Ricci-flat metrics. We summarise some deformation theory for Ricciflat metrics. This is essentially taken from the explanation of the deformation theory for Einstein\nmetrics in [2, \u00a712C] (in turn based on Koiso [10]), specialised to the Ricci-flat case. The main\ndifference in this presentation is a slightly simplified technique in the 'slice argument'.\nLet M n be a compact manifold. The diffeomorphism group D acts on the space of Ricci-flat\nmetrics on M by pull-backs. We define the moduli space W0 of Ricci-flat metrics to be the quotient\nof the space of Ricci-flat metrics by D. (We do not divide by the rescaling action of R+ too, as is\ndone in [2].)\nTake k \u2265 2, and let g be a Ricci-flat Riemannian metric on M . In order to study a neighbourhood\nof gD in W0 we use the usual technique of considering a transverse slice for the diffeomorphism\naction. Such a slice argument is explained very carefully in Ebin [6]. In the current setting it\nis, however, possible to use elliptic regularity to avoid some of the technical subtleties of Ebin's\nargument. As in [17, \u00a76.7], where a similar simplification is used, one advantage compared with\nEbin's approach is that it is easier to extend to the asymptotically cylindrical case.\nWe include the space of smooth Riemannian metrics in the H\u00f6lder space C k,\u03b1 (S 2 T \u2217 M ), and\nlet Dk+1 be the C k+1,\u03b1 completion of D (Dk+1 is generated by exp of C k+1,\u03b1 vector fields). By\nproposition 3.4 the tangent space to the Dk+1 -orbit at g is \u03b4g\u2217 C k+1,\u03b1 (\u039b1 ). Let K be the kernel of\n2\u03b4g + d trg in C k,\u03b1 (S 2 T \u2217 M ). Because g is Ricci-flat, harmonic 1-forms are parallel and therefore\nL2 -orthogonal to the image of 2\u03b4g + d trg . It follows from lemma 3.5 and the Fredholm alternative\nfor \u25b3g on \u03a91 (M ) that there is a direct sum decomposition\nC k,\u03b1 (S 2 T \u2217 M ) = \u03b4g\u2217 C k+1,\u03b1 (\u039b1 ) \u2295 K.\nWe use a neighbourhood S of g in K as a slice for the D-action.\nRemark 3.7. This is not exactly the same choice of slice as in [2]. It has been used before by\nBiquard [3] and Kovalev [11].\nLet Q be the space of Ricci-flat (not a priori smooth) metrics in S \u2013 this is the pre-moduli\nspace of Ricci-flat metrics near g. The linearisation of the Ricci curvature functional at a Ricci-flat\nmetric is given by (cf. [2, Equation (12.28\u2032 )])\n(DRic)g h = \u25b3L h + \u03b4g\u2217 (2\u03b4g + d trg )h,\n2\n\n(8)\n\n\u2217\n\nwhere \u25b3L denotes the Lichnerowicz Laplacian on S T M in the sense of definition 2.4. In particular, on the tangent space K to the slice the linearisation reduces to \u25b3L . This is elliptic so\nits kernel has finite dimension. Moreover, the kernel of \u25b3L is contained in K: differentiating the\nBianchi identity (7) at the Ricci-flat metric g gives\n(2\u03b4g + d trg )(DRic)g = 0,\nand hence\n\u25b3L h = 0 \u21d2 \u25b3(2\u03b4g + d trg )h = 0 \u21d2 (2\u03b4g + d trg )h = 0.\nDefinition 3.8. The space of infinitesimal Ricci-flat deformations of g is the kernel \u03b5(g) of \u25b3L\nin \u0393(S 2 (T \u2217 M )).\nIf h \u2208 \u0393(S 2 T \u2217 M ) is tangent to a curve of Ricci-flat metrics in the slice S then of course h \u2208 \u03b5(g).\nThe converse is not true; in general there may be elements in \u03b5(g) which are not tangent to any\ncurve of Ricci-flat metrics. Thus Q need not be a manifold with tangent space \u03b5(g).\nThe image of DRicg is the L2 -orthogonal complement K \u2032 to \u03b5(g) in K. Let Pg be the L2 -orthogonal projection to K \u2032 . The Ricci curvature functional is real analytic. We can apply the implicit\nfunction theorem to the composition\nF : S \u2192 K \u2032 : h 7\u2192 Pg Ric(h)\n\n(9)\n\nto deduce that there is a real analytic submanifold Z \u2286 S whose tangent space at g is precisely\n\u03b5(g) and which contains Q as a real analytic subset. The analyticity implies that if every element\nof \u03b5(g) is tangent to a curve of Ricci-flat metrics then in fact Q contains a neighbourhood of g\nin Z. Thus the pre-moduli space Q is a manifold in this case (cf. [10, Corollary 3.5]).\n\n\fRICCI-FLAT DEFORMATIONS OF METRICS WITH EXCEPTIONAL HOLONOMY\n\n9\n\nNote that since K is invariant under the isometry group Ig of g we may take S, Z and Q to be\ninvariant too. An analogue of proposition 3.2 holds.\nProposition 3.9. For any g \u2032 \u2208 Q sufficiently close to g, Ig\u2032 \u2286 Ig . Moreover, the identity components of Ig\u2032 and Ig are equal.\nProof. The inclusion Ig\u2032 \u2286 Ig follows from [6, Theorem 7.1(2)]. Proposition 3.6 implies that the\ndimension of the isometry groups of Ricci-flat metrics is b1 (M ), so if Ig\u2032 \u2286 Ig then the identity\ncomponents must be equal.\n\u0003\nThe elements of Z are smooth by elliptic regularity (since the linear part of the equation\nF (h) = 0 defining Z is \u25b3L h = 0), and when Q = Z it is relatively straight-forward to deduce\nfrom the submersion theorem that Q \u2192 W0 is open. In general one needs to do a little bit of extra\nwork.\nTheorem 3.10. Let M be a compact manifold and g a Ricci-flat metric on M . Let Q be the\npre-moduli space of Ricci-flat metrics near g, and Ig the stabiliser of g in D. Then Q/Ig is\nhomeomorphic to a neighbourhood of gD in W0 . In particular, if every element of \u03b5(g) is integrable\nthen W0 is an orbifold near gD.\nProof. We wish to extend (9) to a function on a neighbourhood U of g in C k,\u03b1 (S 2 T \u2217 M ) such\nthat F \u22121 (0) is a manifold containing the Ricci-flat metrics in U and ensure that ZDk+1 \u2229 U \u2286\nF \u22121 (0). Then we apply the submersion theorem to deduce that Z contains representatives for all\ndiffeomorphism classes in F \u22121 (0) close to g.\nBy the inverse function theorem, any element of a small neighbourhood U of g can be written\nas k + \u03c6\u2217 g \u2032 , with k \u2208 K \u2032 , \u03c6 \u2208 Dk+1 and g \u2032 \u2208 Z. Using proposition 3.9,\nf : U \u2192 gDk+1 , k + \u03c6\u2217 g \u2032 7\u2192 \u03c6\u2217 g\nis a well-defined smooth function. If f (h) = \u03c6\u2217 g then Pf (h) is a projection to \u03c6\u2217 K \u2032 , and we can\ntake\nF : U \u2192 K \u2032 , h 7\u2192 Pg Pf (h) Ric(h).\n(10)\n\u2032\n\u22121\nThen DFg maps K onto itself, so F (0) is a submanifold of U by the implicit function theorem.\nBy construction it contains both the Ricci-flat metrics in U and ZDk+1 \u2229 U . Now\nZ \u00d7 Dk+1 \u2192 F \u22121 (0)\n\n(11)\n\nis an open map near (g, id) by the submersion theorem (it is smooth because elements of Z\nare). This implies that any smooth Ricci-flat metric g \u2032 near g is Dk+1 -equivalent to an element\nof Z, which must in fact lie in Q because Ricci-flatness is a diffeomorphism-invariant property.\nSince isometries between smooth Riemannian metrics are smooth (see Myers and Steenrod [15,\nTheorem 8]), g \u2032 is in fact D-equivalent to an element of Q. In other words, Q \u2192 W0 is open.\nProposition 3.9 implies that in fact Q \u2192 W0 is injective up to the action of the stabiliser Ig\nand, since Ig is compact, that the action on Q factors through a finite group (cf. [2, 12.25]). \u0003\nRemark 3.11. Clearly the argument would give the same result even if we were to consider the\nmoduli space of Ricci-flat metrics given by dividing by the action of the full diffeomorphism group\nof M .\nRemark 3.12. In [10, Lemma 2.6] Koiso uses instead of S a slice constructed by Ebin [6], and\nshows that any Einstein metric in this slice is smooth.\n3.4. Proof of theorem I. Let G be one of the Ricci-flat holonomy groups, M a compact G-manifold, \u0393(\u039bG T \u2217 M ) the space of G-structures on M and\nm : \u0393(\u039bG T \u2217 M ) \u2192 \u0393(S 2 T \u2217 M ), \u03c7 7\u2192 g\u03c7\n\n(12)\n\nthe natural map that sends a G-structure to the metric it defines. In order to prove theorem I we\nshow first that for any torsion-free G-structure \u03c7 the derivative of m maps the tangent space to\nthe pre-moduli space R at \u03c7 onto the space \u03b5(g\u03c7 ) of infinitesimal Ricci-flat deformations.\nThe tangent space to \u0393(\u039bG T \u2217 M ) at \u03c7 is the space of differential forms \u0393(E\u03c7 ), where E\u03c7 \u2286\n\u2217 \u2217\n\u039b T M is a vector subbundle associated to the G-structure defined by \u03c7. Fibre-wise \u039bG T \u2217 M is\n\n\f10\n\nJOHANNES NORDSTR\u00d6M\n\na GL(Rn )-orbit and E\u03c7 is the tangent space gln \u03c7 to the orbit. Because m is GL(Rn )-equivariant\nits derivative takes a\u03c7 7\u2192 ag\u03c7 for any a \u2208 gln , which maps onto the fibre of S 2 T \u2217 M . Hence the\nderivative\nDm\u03c7 : \u0393(E\u03c7 ) \u2192 \u0393(S 2 T \u2217 M )\n(13)\nis surjective. Furthermore, the derivative is G-equivariant with respect to the G-structure defined\nby \u03c7. Since \u25b3L is the Lichnerowicz Laplacian on S 2 T \u2217 M , lemma 2.6 implies that the diagram\nbelow commutes.\n\u0393(E\u03c7 )\n\nDm\u2732\n\u03c7\n\u0393(S 2 T \u2217 M )\n\u25b3L\n\n\u25b3\n\n\u2744\n\u2744 Dm\n\u03c7\n\u2732\n\u0393(S 2 T \u2217 M )\n\u0393(E\u03c7 )\nHence\nLemma 3.13. If \u03c7 is a torsion-free G-structure then Dm\u03c7 maps the harmonic sections of E\u03c7\nonto the space \u03b5(g\u03c7 ) of infinitesimal Ricci-flat deformations.\nSo let \u03c7 be any torsion-free G-structure on M and R the pre-moduli space of torsion-free\nG-structures near \u03c7. As described in subsection 3.3, there is a slice at g\u03c7 for the D-action on the\nmetrics, the Ricci-flat metrics in the slice are a real analytic subset of a submanifold Z, and the\ntangent space to Z at \u03c7 is \u03b5(g\u03c7 ). Let P : F \u22121 (0) \u2192 Z be the composition of a smooth local right\ninverse to the submersion (11) with the projection to the first factor. F \u22121 (0) contains the Ricci-flat\nmetrics near g\u03c7 , and P can be viewed as a local projection to the slice: P (g \u2032 ) is D-equivalent to\ng \u2032 for any Ricci-flat g \u2032 close to g\u03c7 . Then\nP \u25e6m:R\u2192Z\n\n(14)\n\nis a well-defined smooth map and lemma 3.13 means that its derivative at \u03c7 is surjective. Therefore\nevery element of \u03b5(g\u03c7 ) is tangent to a path of Ricci-flat metrics, so Q is a manifold. By the\nsubmersion theorem, WG (the image of MG in W0 ) contains a neighbourhood of gD.\nThe pre-images of g\u03c7 under m are defined by differential forms which are harmonic with respect\nto g\u03c7 . By Hodge theory they represent distinct cohomology classes. Let Ig\u03c7 \u2286 D be the isometries\nof g\u03c7 isotopic to the identity. Because Ig\u03c7 acts trivially on cohomology it must fix the fibre over of\nm over g\u03c7 , so Ig\u03c7 = I\u03c7 . Now, if g \u2032 \u2208 Q then g \u2032 = \u03c6\u2217 m(\u03c7\u2032 ) for some \u03c7\u2032 \u2208 R and \u03c6 \u2208 Dk+1 because\n(14) is a submersion. As I\u03c7 acts trivially on R by proposition 3.2 it follows that the conjugate Ig\u03c6\u03c7\nfixes g \u2032 . But then Ig\u03c6\u03c7 \u2286 Ig\u2032 \u2286 Ig\u03c7 by proposition 3.9, so in fact Ig\u03c6\u03c7 = Ig\u03c7 . Hence Ig\u03c7 fixes any\ng \u2032 \u2208 Q.\nNow theorem 3.10 implies that Q is homeomorphic to a neighbourhood of W0 . Thus WG is a\nmanifold near gD and the proof of theorem I is complete.\n3.5. The asymptotically cylindrical case. The proof of theorem I only used the compactness\nassumption to access certain deformation results for G-structures and Ricci-flat metrics. For the\ncases G = G2 and Spin(7) there are pre-moduli spaces of EAC G-structures, with properties\nanalogous to proposition 3.1.\nIf M is an EAC G-manifold, let MG denote the quotient of the space of torsion-free EAC\nG-structures on M by the group D of EAC diffeomorphisms of M isotopic to the identity.\nProposition 3.14. Let G = Spin(7) or G2 , M an EAC G-manifold and \u03c7 a torsion-free EAC\nG-structure on M . Then there is a submanifold R of the space of C 1 G-structures such that\n(i) the elements of R are smooth EAC torsion-free G-structures,\n(ii) the tangent space to R at \u03c7 is the space of bounded harmonic sections of E\u03c7 ,\n(iii) the natural map R \u2192 MG is a homeomorphism onto a neighbourhood of \u03c7D in MG .\nProof. See [17, \u00a76] for the G2 case, and [16, \u00a74.3] for the Spin(7) case.\n\n\u0003\n\n\fRICCI-FLAT DEFORMATIONS OF METRICS WITH EXCEPTIONAL HOLONOMY\n\n11\n\nIn order to prove the theorem I\u2032 , the EAC version of theorem I, it therefore suffices to explain\nhow to set up the deformation theory for EAC Ricci-flat metrics. Below we define the slices with\nsame equations as in the compact case in \u00a73.3 and use the same reasoning as for deformations\nof EAC G2 -manifolds in [17, \u00a76.7] to make the slice arguments work on EAC manifolds. The\nresulting approach is similar to that of Kovalev [11], who considers Ricci-flat deformations of EAC\nCalabi-Yau manifolds.\nLet M n be a manifold with cylindrical ends and cross-section X n\u22121 . Let W0 be the quotient\nof the space of EAC Ricci-flat metrics (with any exponential rate) by the group D of EAC diffeomorphisms of M isotopic to the identity. We pick an EAC Ricci-flat metric g on M and study\na neighbourhood of gD in W0 . By definition, the asymptotic limit of g is a cylindrical metric\ndt2 + gX on X \u00d7 R, where gX is a Ricci-flat metric on X.\nWe work with weighted H\u00f6lder spaces of sections. Let k \u2265 2, \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1), and \u03b4 > 0 be less than\nthe exponential rate of g. The metric g defines a Hodge Laplacian on 1-forms and a Lichnerowicz\nLaplacian on symmetric bilinear forms, which are both asymptotically translation-invariant operators. We require that \u03b4 is small enough that the Laplacians are Fredholm on C\u03b4k,\u03b1 spaces, as we\nmay according to theorem 2.8.\nWe proved in \u00a73.3 that there is a real analytic submanifold Z \u2282 C k,\u03b1 (S 2 T \u2217 X) which contains\nrepresentatives of all diffeomorphism classes of Ricci-flat metrics on X close to gX . Its tangent\nspace TgX Z = \u03b5(gX ) is the space of Lichnerowicz harmonic sections of S 2 T \u2217 X.\nLet MZk denote the space of C k,\u03b1 metrics on M which are C\u03b4k,\u03b1 -asymptotic to cylindrical metrics\n2\ndt + gX\nsuch that gX \u2208 Z. If \u03c1 is a cut-off function for the cylinder then \u03c1Z can be identified with\na space of bilinear forms on M , and MZk is an open subset\nMZk \u2282 C\u03b4k,\u03b1 (S \u2217 T \u2217 M ) + \u03c1Z.\nk+1\nSimilarly let DZ\nbe the set of EAC diffeomorphisms with rate \u03b4 which are asymptotic to elements\nof the isometry group IgX of gX . Then MZk contains representatives of all diffeomorphism classes of\nRicci-flat metrics near g and, because Z is IgX -invariant, proposition 3.9 implies that any isometry\nk+1\nbetween elements of MZk must lie in DZ\n(a similar argument for simplifying the problem by a\nslice at the boundary was used to study the moduli space of torsion-free EAC G2 -structures in\nk+1\nat g. The tangent\n[17, Lemma 6.24]). We therefore identify a slice in MZk for the action of DZ\nk\nspace to MZ at g is\nTg MZk = C\u03b4k,\u03b1 (S \u2217 T \u2217 M ) \u2295 \u03c1\u03b5(gX ).\nk+1\ncorresponds to vector fields which are C\u03b4k,\u03b1 -asymptotic\nThe tangent space at the identity of DZ\n1\n1 \u266f\n) , where H\u221e\nto translation-invariant Killing vector fields on the cylinder, i.e. to elements of (H\u221e\ndenotes the translation-invariant harmonic 1-forms on the cylinder X \u00d7 R. By proposition 3.4 the\nk+1\ntangent space to the DZ\n-orbit at g is\n1\n\u03b4g\u2217 (C\u03b4k,\u03b1 (\u039b1 ) \u2295 \u03c1H\u221e\n).\n\nLet K be the kernel of 2\u03b4g + d trg in Tg MZk .\nLemma 3.15. Let M be a Ricci-flat EAC manifold with a single end. Then\n1\nTg MZk = K \u2295 \u03b4g\u2217 (C\u03b4k,\u03b1 (\u039b1 ) \u2295 \u03c1H\u221e\n).\n\n(15)\n\n\u2217\n\nProof. (2\u03b4g + d trg )\u03b4 = \u25b3g according to lemma 3.5, so it suffices to show that the image of\n2\u03b4g + d trg : Tg MZk \u2192 C\u03b4k\u22121,\u03b1 (\u039b1 ) is contained in the image of\n1\n\u25b3 : C\u03b4k+1,\u03b1 (\u039b1 ) \u2295 \u03c1H\u221e\n\u2192 C\u03b4k\u22121,\u03b1 (\u039b1 ).\n\nIt follows from theorem 2.8 that this has index 0, so its image is the L2 -orthogonal complement\nto its kernel H01 , the space of bounded harmonic 1-forms.\nNow, if h \u2208 Tg MZk and \u03b2 \u2208 H01 then the difference between <\u03b4g h, \u03b2> and <h, \u03b4g\u2217 \u03b2> = 0 is\nthe divergence of the contraction of h with \u03b2. The boundary condition on h ensures that the\nasymptotic limit of the contraction has no dt-component, so the integral of the divergence is 0.\nHence\n<\u03b4g h, \u03b2>L2 = 0.\n\n\f12\n\nJOHANNES NORDSTR\u00d6M\n\nThe hypothesis that M has a single end ensures that the asymptotic limit of \u03b2 has no dt-component\n(corollary 2.10), so integration by parts also applies to show that <d trg h, \u03b2>L2 = 0. Thus the\nimage of 2\u03b4g + d trg is L2 -orthogonal to H01 .\n\u0003\nNow we can use a real analytic Ig -invariant submanifold S \u2282 MZk with Tg S = K as a slice for\nk+1\nthe DZ\n-action. Let Q \u2282 S be the subset of Ricci-flat metrics. As in the compact case Q is an\nanalytic subset of an analytic submanifold Z \u2032 \u2282 S, defined as the zero set of the composition of the\nRicci functional S \u2192 C\u03b4k\u22122,\u03b1 (S 2 T \u2217 M ) with the projection onto the image of its derivative at g.\nOn K the derivative of the Ricci functional is the Lichnerowicz Laplacian, so Tg Z \u2032 is the space of\nharmonic sections of S 2 T \u2217 M , exponentially asymptotic to sections of S 2 T \u2217 X (i.e. the asymptotic\nlimit has no dt-components). This is the space of infinitesimal Ricci-flat EAC deformations \u03b5(g).\nIn general we can use regularity and arguments like in [17, \u00a76.6] to show that Z consists of\nsmooth EAC metrics, and then extend the proof of theorem 3.10, thus proving that Q/Ig is\nhomeomorphic to a neighbourhood of g in W0 .\nWe have now set up the deformation theory for EAC Ricci-flat metrics that is required, together\nwith the unobstructedness of deformations of torsion-free EAC G-structures for G = G2 and\nSpin(7) stated in proposition 3.14, in order to prove theorem I\u2032 by the same argument as for the\ncompact case.\nReferences\n[1] M.
