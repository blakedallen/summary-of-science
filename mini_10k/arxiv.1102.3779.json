As the\nWD travels in its orbit it accretes matter from the RG wind, growing slowly in mass. The orbital period is around 460 days (Dobrzycka and Kenyon, 1994), but the system does not eclipse as the\ninclination angle is approximately 50\u25e6 to the line-of-sight, assuming a massive WD around 1.2 - 1.4 solar masses (Brandi, 2009). It\nhas experienced at least six dramatic optical brightening events or\noutbursts (in 1898, 1933, 1958, 1967, 1985 and 2006) generally attributed thermonuclear runaway (TNR) events within the accreted\nmatter on the WD surface. Two other events are suggested in the\nliterature (1907; 1945 from Schaefer 2004; Oppenheimer & Mattei\n1993, respectively). The optical development during an outburst is\nvery similar in each case (Rosino 1986). Following the 2006 outburst, a WD mass of around 1.35 solar masses has been suggested\n(Sokoloski et al. 2006) implying that it may be a Supernova Ia progenitor.\nSince the WD is gaining mass through accretion, but losing\nmass due to the outbursts, an interesting question is: what happens to the overall mass of the WD after an outburst? Will it increase, stay unchanged or decrease over many outbursts? If it ac-\n\ntually increases in mass then this means that at some point it will\nexceed the Chandrasekhar limit, which will lead to a Type Ia Supernova (Sokoloski et al. 2006). Supernovae outbursts play an important role in the history of the universe and as standard candles.\nBeing able to observe a complete recurrent nova cycle from preoutburst accretion to post-outburst quiescence in sufficient detail\nwill tell us a lot about the physical processes involved. If we were\nable to predict an outburst, we would be able to take spectroscopic\nand multi-band observations of the star before and at the beginning\nof the outburst, which has never been done before.\nHere we examine the optical lightcurve between 1933 and\n2008, which includes five confirmed and one suspected outburst.\nThe data have been taken from the American Association of Variable Star Observers (Henden 2009, AAVSO hereafter) and are\nmainly visual estimates. In Section 2 we present the lightcurve over\n75 years and discuss previous work to analyse the variations. In\nSection 3 we look at a Bayesian approach to parameterising the\nform of the lightcurve during the outbursts, describing the stages\nof post-outburst development and providing a model that supports\nthe subsequent analysis of the whole lightcurve. Section 4 presents\na wavelet analysis of the lightcurve, which leads to a pre-outburst\nsignal that is present in the data even if we remove the outbursts\n\n\f2\n\nS. Adamakis et al.\n\nthemselves. In Section 5 we discuss this feature and its potential\nutility in predicting outbursts sufficiently early to allow detailed\nobservations of the pre-outburst and peak periods of the next outburst.\n\n2 OPTICAL LIGHTCURVE\nFig. 1 shows the AAVSO visual lightcurve from 1933 August 16th\nup until the 2008 January 31st (44,655 points over 27196 days).\nThese are mainly naked eye visual estimates from amateur astronomers, while more recently these are supplemented by V band\ntelescope measurements, also from amateur observers. There is\nconsiderable scatter, but the data is of sufficient quality to determine some basic features:\n\u2022 There are clear peaks in 1933, 1958, 1967, 1985 and 2006\ndue to the optical brightening \u2013 this is the fundamental activity that\nidentifies the object as a recurrent novae.\n\u2022 The quiescent light curve fluctuates between 9.6 and 12.8\nmagnitudes, but with no periodicity or other pattern.\n\u2022 The time from outburst to decline to quiescent mean magnitude is about 100 days, but the light consistently declines below\nthis point and only recovers to approximately the mean after 400 to\n500 days.\n\u2022 The seasonal gap from mid-November until late-January, is\nlong enough to contain most of an outburst, so that we may have\nmissed one or more. However each decline-and-recovery phase is\nsufficiently similar and lasts long enough that the tail of such a\nhidden outburst might be identifiable.\nAs we examine the characteristics of the outbursts, we also\npresent the 1000 days around each outburst in Fig. 2. We also include the data around 1945 that led Oppenheimer & Mattei (1993)\nto suggest an outburst that was missed in the seasonal gap.\nA number of authors (Dobrzycka, Kenyon & Milone\n1996; Sokoloski, Bildsten & Ho 2001; Gromadzki et al. 2006;\nWorters et al. 2007; Zamanov et al. 2010) have found flickering\u2013\nlike fluctuations on timescales of minutes, and Worters et al. (2007)\nwere the first to detect the resumption of flickering post\u2013outburst.\nAs flickering of this sort is generally attributed to accretion in binary star systems, this enabled the first post\u2013outburst accretion rate\nestimate to be made. The AAVSO lightcurve presented here has\ninsufficient time resolution to allow flickering analysis. However it\nshould be noted that night-to-night variations of 0.5 mag are seen\nin high time resolution data, so that the AAVSO data have some\nsensitivity to the underlying amplitude of flickering.\nWe extract the outburst events from Fig. 1 and conduct a\nBayesian analysis to characterise the decline, described in Section 3. We also use the data in Fig. 1 as the basis of a wavelet\nanalysis with a Morlet mother function (Torrence & Compo 1998),\nas described in Section 4.\n\n3 DECLINE OF THE LIGHT CURVE FOLLOWING AN\nOUTBURST\nOppenheimer & Mattei (1993) discussed the decline rate of the outbursts. They divided each outburst into different phases according\nto the decline rate and concluded that each outburst consists of three\nbreakpoints before the star begins to brighten again. In this section,\nwe model the outburst data with simple curves. The aim is simply\n\nto parameterise the form of the decline, rather than determine any\nunderlying physical model.\nIn order to apply the statistical analysis, we take the first\n500 days of each outburst (including the proposed 1945 one). The\ntotal number of data values is n = 8505. The most well observed\noutburst is the one that happened in 2006 with 4109 observed\npoints. The more observed points there are in an outburst, the more\ninformation will be added from this outburst to the statistical analysis we undertake. Oppenheimer & Mattei (1993) commented that\nthe decline rate and then brightening rate of the proposed 1945 (obscured) outburst is akin to all the other outbursts, and that this combination has never been observed outside of an outburst. From this\nresemblance of the light curves, we have a reason to believe that\nthe same physical mechanisms cause all the outbursts. Thence, we\ncan assume that all the outbursts can be described with the same\nparametrised model.\n3.1 Models for Bayesian analysis\nWe apply Bayesian analysis to the declines from maximum for each\noutburst in the data. We consider four models. In each case the time\nt4 = 500 days defines the end of the outburst, and the parameters\n\u03b31 , \u03b32 , \u03b33 , \u03b34 are calculated to ensure each model is continuous.\nWe take time zero as a parameter to determine the start of each outburst, instead of assuming it is defined by the first observed point\nin outburst; this allow us to estimate the start date of the proposed\n1945 outburst and hence check that it would not have been visible\nbefore the seasonal gap. The break points in the decline are calculated as times t1 , t2 and t3 from this zero point.\nModel 1. This is the most complicated model of the four with\n11 free parameters. It consists of four stages. During the first three\nthere is a decline in magnitude, whereas in the last one it increases.\n\n\uf8f1\n\u03b3 + \u03b11 log(t + \u03b21 ),\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 1\n\n\u03b32 + \u03b12 exp(\u03b22 t),\nM1 : \u03bc =\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 \u03b33 + \u03b13 exp(\u03b23 t),\n\u03b34 + \u03b14 t,\n\n0 6 t < t1\nt1 6 t < t2\nt2 6 t < t3\nt3 6 t < t4\n\n(1)\n\nThe parameter space for this model will be P1\n=\n(\u03b31 , \u03b11 , \u03b21 , t1 , \u03b12 , \u03b22 , t2 , \u03b13 , \u03b23 , t3 , \u03b14 ).\nModel 2. This is the second most complex model with 10 free\nparameters. It consists of four stages. The only difference between\nthis and the M1 model is the third stage, where instead of an exponential function we assume a straight line.\n\n\uf8f1\n\u03b3 + \u03b11 log(t + \u03b21 ),\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 1\n\n\u03b32 + \u03b12 exp(\u03b22 t),\nM2 : \u03bc =\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 \u03b33 + \u03b13 t,\n\u03b34 + \u03b14 t,\n\n0 6 t < t1\nt1 6 t < t2\nt2 6 t < t3\nt3 6 t < t4\n\n(2)\n\nThe parameter space for this model will be P1\n=\n(\u03b31 , \u03b11 , \u03b21 , t1 , \u03b12 , \u03b22 , t2 , \u03b13 , t3 , \u03b14 ).\nModel 3. This model consists of nine free parameters and four\nstages. The only change from the M2 model is the second stage,\nwhere instead of an exponential function we assume a straight line.\n\n\uf8f1\n\u03b3 + \u03b11 log(t + \u03b21 ),\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 1\n\n\u03b32 + \u03b12 t,\nM3 : \u03bc =\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 \u03b33 + \u03b13 t,\n\u03b34 + \u03b14 t,\n\n0 6 t < t1\nt1 6 t < t2\nt2 6 t < t3\nt3 6 t < t4\n\n(3)\n\nThe parameter space for this model will be P1\n=\n(\u03b31 , \u03b11 , \u03b21 , t1 , \u03b12 , t2 , \u03b13 , t3 , \u03b14 ).\nModel 4.

We incorporate P2 = (\u03c41 , . . . , \u03c46 ) as parameters so that the data will decide their values. This will also give\nus the information about how many days after the 1945 peak the\nfirst observation occurred. Therefore, the parameter space will be\nP = (P1 , P2 ).\n\n3.2 Preferred model\nFirst, we will try to choose which of the four models fits best to the\ndata we have and after that we present the parameter estimations for\nthat particular model. The codes used for this analysis were written\nand implemented by Adamakis (2009).\nTable 1 depicts the logarithmic marginal densities estimation\nwith three different approximation methods. All of them choose\nmodel M2 as the best, although M2 is \"not more than a bare mention\" better than M3 , according to the criteria of Kass & Raftery\n(1995). The information criteria (Table 2) choose M2 and M3 as\n\n\f4\n\nS. Adamakis et al.\n\nFigure 2.

Although M2 maximises the likelihood compared to M3 , the\nfact that it contains one more parameter than M3 does not allow\nBayes factor estimations to clearly favour M2 . Therefore, M3 can-\n\nnot be excluded. Nevertheless, we select model M2 for further analysis.\nTable 3 provides all the information we need for the parameter\nestimation. We will not comment separately on each parameter because there are too many. Instead we will try to focus on the most\nimportant ones.

Between \u223c 53 days and \u223c 107 days (95%\ncredible interval between 102 and 109) from the beginning of the\noutburst, the decline rate changes from logarithmic to exponential.\nThe decline is completed \u223c 143 days after the beginning of the\nactual outburst (95% credible interval between \u223c 139 and \u223c 146\ndays). The decline rates can be taken from parameters \u03b11 , \u03b21 , \u03b12 ,\n\u03b22 , \u03b13 and \u03b14 , with the alpha values in units of mag day\u22121 .\nThe first observed data-point for the 1945 outburst was \u223c\n68 days after the modelled beginning of the outburst. Given the\nfact that the seasonal gap started 69.20 days before the first observed point, this means that there was an outburst only a few days\nafter we entered the seasonal gap. Especially for \u03c42 , a 95% credible\ninterval will give a value between 63.09 and 69.09 days. We were\nmore lucky with the 1985 outburst because before the first observed\ndata-point there was a seasonal gap of 65.40 days. Since the modal\nvalue for the start of the 1985 outburst b\n\u03c45 = 0.01 days, this means\nthat this outburst started just after the end of the seasonal gap. All\nthe other outbursts did not seem to have any observational gaps before the first observed data-points, giving us the chance to observe\nthem almost at the beginning. Fig. 3 shows all the outburst data\naligned by start date. The red solid line depicts the chosen model\n(M2 ) , whereas the blue dashed lines show the breakpoints as the\nmodal values b\nt1 , b\nt2 , and b\nt3 .\nFrom this we have demonstrated that the 1945 data are consistent with an outburst beginning and completing most of its decline\nduring the seasonal gap, but with the final decline and recovery visible. It does not prove that this is an outburst, as we included it in\nour analysis. But it is the simplest explanation of the data. As noted\nby Oppenheimer & Mattei (1993) the data that are available show\na form that is only seen after outbursts. If we accept that there was\nan outburst at this time, the mean recurrence interval goes down.\nBetween 1933 and 1967 the mean interval was just over 10 years,\ncompared with a mean over all seven outbursts of approximately\n15 years.\n\n6\n\nM4\n\n8\n\nM3\n\n10\n\nM2\n\n12\n\n1\n2\n3\n\nM1\n\nVisual Magnitude\n\n4\n\n2\n\nTable 1.

We\napplied the implementation of these techniques in the Fortran 77 software available from those authors available via\natoc.colorado.edu/research/wavelets. In order to apply a wavelet\nanalysis the data must be evenly sampled. Thus we have re-sampled\nto a one day interval. Where a day had more than one observation,\nwe have taken an average, while we take a linear interpolation from\nthe adjacent dates over days with no data. Seasonal gaps are replaced with the mean value for the entire lightcurve. As 90% of\nthe data are from the quiescent periods the effect of outbursts on\nthe mean is small. As the analysis relies on a range of input data\nto generate each point in the output data, we pad beyond the start\nand end of the data with the mean value, until the total number of\ndata points reaches the next power of two. While we used a Morlet mother function (Torrence & Compo 1998) that is designed to\nidentify periodic signals in the data, power appears in the resultant\npower plot due to discontinuities in the data such as those seen at\noutburst.\nWhile a complex wavelet function, such as used here, can\nallow the separation of both phase and amplitude of the data\nand is useful for identifying oscillations, a real wavelet function\nmerges these two in one component and can be helpful to isolate\npeaks or discontinuities (Meyers, Kelly & O'Brien 1993). In this\npaper the wavelet power spectrum is defined as the sum of the\nsquares of the real and imaginary parts of the wavelet transform\n(Torrence & Compo 1998). Formally there is a cone of influence\n(COI) outside which there is not enough information to determine\nif a signal is real. Primarily this excludes periods longer than the\ntime\u2013span of the data, but early and late in the time series it is also\naffected by the padding, hence the cone\u2013like shape.More specif-\n\n\f6\n\nS.

The vertical dotted\nlines represent the beginning of an outburst as determined from our\nparametrisation approach. All the peaks in the wavelet power spectrum are associated with an outburst. A similar feature can be located for the year 1945, where Oppenheimer & Mattei (1993) suggested an additional outburst. However, the wavelet power is not\nas strong as all the other outbursts due to the lack of data during\nthe brightest part of the outburst (as we found in Section 3 if an\noutburst had indeed occurred, it started during the seasonal gap).\nThe most prominent peak in the wavelet power spectrum of\nFig. 4a is linked with the 1967 outburst. This has to do with the\nfact that during the last stage of the magnitude decline of the outburst the magnitude becomes fainter than 12, which might be an\nindication that the 1967 outburst was more powerful than the others observed. Note that the features we observe are not symmetric\nabout the beginning of each outburst. This asymmetry is because\nthe wavelet power is influenced by the data before and after the outbursts. The signal for the 2006 outburst seems to be weaker than the\nrest of the outbursts because part of it is outside of the COI. This\nmeans that the wavelet power at larger scales will decrease as we\napproach the edges because we pad the end of the time series with\nthe mean value.\n\n4.1 Pre\u2013outburst Signal\nA natural response of the wavelet power to discontinuities in the\ndata (such as those seen at outburst in Fig. 4a) is a peak in the\npower at the time of the discontinuity. We decided to remove the\nfirst 143 days of each outburst and undertake the same analysis.\nThe removed data have been replaced with the mean of the time\nseries, as presented in Fig. 4b. We tested the robustness of the results for different choices for replacement data, including a sinusoid of 50 day period and the residuals of subtracting the model\ndetermined in Section 3. Introducing different artificial values for\n\nthe removed data did not affect the outcome of this analysis other\nthan to insignificantly change the detailed distribution of power in\nthe wavelet power spectrum.\nFig. 4b shows the resultant wavelet power spectrum. There are\npeaks in the wavelet power spectrum at a period range between 600\nand 800 days that are associated with each of the 1945, 1985 and\n2006 pre-outburst phases. This implies that these three outbursts are\nmost similar regarding the light curve. The fact that part of the 2006\npeak of the wavelet power is outside of the COI does not suggest\nthat the wavelet power is completely wrong. Since we pad with the\nmean value of the time series at the edges, we expect the wavelet\npower near the edges at large scales to be less than it otherwise\nwould be. This means that if we had more years of data, then the\n2006 wavelet power peak would be entirely inside the COI and appear with enhanced wavelet power. The 1967 outburst is associated\nwith a feature in the period range 500 and 1100 days, whereas the\n1958 outburst does not give any significant peak associated with the\npre\u2013outburst. Thus we believe that the peak for 1958 in the wavelet\npower spectrum in Fig. 1b, when the outburst data is retained,is\ndue only to the data discontinuity. It is clear that all of the other\noutbursts (apart from the 1958) are linked with a specific form of\nwavelet power variation roughly around a period of 700\u2013800 days\nwhich appears before the outburst begins, and so cannot be due to\nthe discontinuity. Last but not least, the pre-outburst phase and the\npost-outburst phase (i.e. after 143 days from the outburst) of the\nlight curve seem to follow the same pattern in all cases.\nThis is another indication why we should remove the outbursts\nfrom the analysis, as the peak for the wavelet power for the 1958\noutburst in Fig.4a is created only by the data discontinuity. Therefore, the 1958 and 1967 outbursts might have progressed differently\nand may provide a key to the outburst mechanisms. In addition the\n1958 outburst was only 9 years before the 1967 outburst, and also\nthe 1958 outburst was not associated with any fluctuation around\nthat range.\nTo conclude, each outburst is associated with a peak in the\nwavelet power spectrum around period 500 to 1000 days (apart\nfrom the 1958 outburst), which never appears outside of an outburst. A detailed analysis shows that these peaks are part of the\ntrue signal and not due to the observational uncertainty.\n\n\fThe outbursts of RS Ophiuchi\n1933\nb\n1933\n\n1945\n1945\n\n1958 1967\n\n1958 1967\n\n1985\n1985\n\n2006\n\n2006\n\n(a)\n\n1933\nb\n1933\n\n1945\n1945\n\n1958 1967\n\n1958 1967\n\n1985\n1985\n\n7\n\n2006\n\n2006\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 4.

Note that the pre-outburst signal remains even in the absence of the outburst discontinuity, and is visible for the 1945 obscured\noutburst. The scale of the power is different in (a) and (b), as indicated by the scale bars in each case.\n\n5 DISCUSSION\nFrom our Bayesian analysis, using a piecewise model curve fitting\nfor the declines from outburst, we find breakpoints in the decline at\n\u223c53, \u223c107 and \u223c143 days after the outburst. It is not clear that\nthese are associated with any other changes in the system's behaviour. The X-ray flux shows a change in the power-law of the\ndecline at around day 70 (Bode et al. 2008; Ness et al. 2008) but\nthere is no obvious physical reason to relate this to changes in the\noptical light curve. The super-soft phase also settled into a reasonably stable state around day 50 (Hachisu, Kato & Luna 2007) but\nagain this cannot be clearly associated with the optical break by any\nphysical mechanism.\nIt was found that the first observed point of the 1945 outburst\nwas \u223c68 days after the actual beginning of the outburst, which\nmeans that there was probably an outburst beginning at most a few\ndays after the seasonal gap began. Using wavelet analysis the preand post-outburst features in the light curve at this time can be distinguished, and are similar to all the other outbursts (apart from the\n1958 one). Identifying an outburst in 1945 reduces the mean interval outburst recurrence rate from \u223c20 years (Starrfield 2006) to\n\u223c12.5 years. This also makes the nine year interval between the\n1958 and 1967 outbursts less anomalous - moving it much closer to\nthe median interval than when the 1945 outburst is excluded (from\n1.25 standard deviations to 0.7 standard deviations).\nA more detailed look at the wavelet power for each outburst\nsuggests that the 1945, 1985 and 2006 outbursts had similar magnitude wavelet peaks. The 1967 outburst has an unusually strong\nwavelet peak while in 1958 there is no significant peak. While we\ncan say nothing about the outburst mechanisms from this, it does\nsuggest some observable pre\u2013outburst activity in most cases \u2013 with\nthe only analysed outburst without such a peak followed by a sec-\n\nond outburst within 9 years, still the shortest observed interval. The\nonly major parameter in outburst models (e.g. Yaron et al. 2005)\nthat can be varied on such short timescales is the mass accretion\nrate onto the WD. Variable mass transfer also seems to be the only\nplausible process that could generate the pre\u2013outburst activity indicated by our wavelet analysis. We note that the pre\u2013outburst signal\nin the power plots are similar regardless if we include or exclude\nthe outbursts themselves in the light curve (compare Figs. 4a and\n4b).\nSince we know what a typical characteristic of each outburst\nis, then we can use it for outburst prediction. Even 200 days before\nthe outburst the wavelet analysis shows this pre-outburst trend of\nthe star. For 455 days (an orbital period) this feature is less significant but in some cases (1967 and 1985 outbursts) is still recoverable. Hence, we have a means to predict outbursts in this object.\nFurther work will extend this to similar systems. If it turns out to\nbe robust then it may also have implications for the outburst mechanism as a TNR should have no pre-outburst signal.\n\n5.1 Outbursts prediction\nSince (almost) every analysed outburst is linked with a pre-outburst\nfeature in the wavelet power spectrum, this can be a useful tool for\noutburst prediction. To test this, wavelet analysis for the time interval between two outbursts has been applied. The starting point of\neach time series was 500 days after the beginning of the outburst.\nThe end point of each time series was 455 days before the beginning of the next outburst, which coincides with one orbital period.\nThe aim here was to investigate the appearance of the pre\u2013outburst\nsignal as we approach outburst.\nIn Fig. 5, data values between the 1933 and the 1967 outbursts\n\n\f8\n\nS. Adamakis et al.\n\nwere analyzed. We can clearly see the peak in the wavelet power\nspectrum at a period around 600\u2013800 days associated with the start\nof the 1945 outburst determined in Section 3. No such signal is\napparent for 1958, consistent with the result for the entire dataset. The pre\u2013outburst signal for the 1967 outburst is growing, albeit\noutside the COI. A similar analysis of the period from 1958 to 2006\nshowed similar signals for each outburst, with the 1967 one being\nby far the strongest.\nThe wavelet power of this peak drops as we approach the end\nof the time series because more wavelet function is convolved with\nthe artificial data we pad the end of the time series with. The interaction of the true data with the artificial data will reduce the value\nof the wavelet power, the structure of which can only be influenced\nby changes in the real data. Although this feature is initially outside of the COI, it can still be recognized. As no other feature like\nthis at that period range can be observed in the rest of the time series, this is consistent with the appearance of such a feature at the\nmost recent end of the wavelet power plot indicating an approaching outburst. When we assumed we did not know that at the end\nof these data there was an outburst, and did the same analysis up\nto: i) 1 day before the outburst, ii) 100 days before the outburst,\nand iii) 200 days before the outburst, we still see this feature for\nevery outburst where one was seen when the data from either side\nof the outburst were included (1945, 1967, 1985 and 2006). The\ncloser we get to the outburst the better defined this feature is. Similar analysis has been applied to all the time intervals between each\npair of outbursts. The outcome was that a peak in the wavelet power\nspectrum like the one in Fig. 5 was observed before every outburst,\napart from the 1958 outburst. Given that this also had the shortest\ninterval to the next outburst in 1967 (which was then the strongest\noutburst seen so far) it may be that something peculiar happened at\nthat date compared with the other outbursts. We do not have data\nbefore 1933 at sufficient density to subject to this analysis, so we\ncannot say anything about that outburst or the one in 1898.\n\n1933\n\n1945\n\n1958\n\n1967\n\nFigure 5.

This holds\nout the possibility of having an early warning of outbursts in the\nfuture. It also suggests some implication of the accretion process\nin the onset of outburst, as a TNR would not provide such a pre\u2013\noutburst signal. We are working to extend this work to similar objects.\n\n6 CONCLUSION\nWe have analysed 76 years of optical photometry of the recurrent\nnova RS Ophiuchi, allowing analysis of both the quiescent and outburst phases over that time. Bayesian analysis of the decline from\nmaximum of the combined data from the five accepted outbursts in\nthe data and the proposed 1945 outburst show that there is a preferred set of break points when the form of the decline changes,\nat \u223c53 days, \u223c107 days and \u223c143 days after the outburst peak,\nafter which the optical light recovers towards the quiescent level\nover another \u223c65 days. With this empirical model of the decline,\nwe are able to place the start point of the 1945 outburst proposed by\nOppenheimer & Mattei (1993) as only about a day after the start of\nthe preceding seasonal gap. The 1945 data contribute so little to the\nBayesian analysis we can be confident that the decline seen here,\nbut no where else in the lightcurve outside of a confirmed outburst,\nis due to a 7th outburst as proposed by Oppenheimer & Mattei\n(1993).\nTurning to the overall lightcurve, including the quiescent\nphases, a wavelet analysis shows that there is a signal in wavelet\npower due to the outbursts. While some of this signal is contributed\nby the discontinuity due to the outburst, replacing the outburst data\nwith continuous data essentially indistinguishable from quiescent\ndata only reduces the strength of the signal prior to the known start\ndates for the outbursts. Thus it appears that we have identified a\npre\u2013outburst signature up to 450 days before outburst in the wavelet\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank Dr Mike Marsh for creating an independent\nplot equivalent to Fig. 4 as part of checking the outcomes for this paper.
