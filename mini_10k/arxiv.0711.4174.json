Ad\nKey words: nano- MgB2, Flux pinning.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe improvement of the pinning behavior in MgB2 is being considered as a key issue in\nthe superconductivity field; many attempts have been made in this direction for enhancing the\npinning strength of MgB2. In the last five years, various carbon sources [1-3], silicates [4], single\nelements [5,6], carbohydrates [7], organic acids [8] and other compounds [9,10] have been doped\nin MgB2 and reported. It has become more clear that structural defects with dimensions at nano\nscale play an important role for flux pinning i.e. nanoparticle doping is the most effective\napproach to improve the superconducting performance of MgB2 and making MgB2 acceptable\nfor practical applications [11]. Nano particle doping can modify structure and electronic\nproperties such as Tc, upper critical field and its anisotropy, gaps width, inter and intra-band\nscattering, defect structure etc. [12-14]. In present paper, we are discussing the effect of nano\ndiamond addition on polycrystalline MgB2 i.e. how the superconducting performance of pristine\nsample is modified by addition of n-Diamond.\n\nII. EXPERIMENTAL\n\nThe MgB2-nano Diamond composites with composition MgB2 - nDx (x= 0%, 1%, 3%, 5%,\n7% & 10%) are synthesized by solid-state reaction route with ingredients of Mg, B and nDiamond. The Mg powder used is from Reidel-de-Haen of assay 99%, B powder is amorphous\nand Fluka make of assay 95-97%. The n-Diamond powder is from Aldrich with average particle\nsize (APS) of 7-10 nm. For synthesis of MgB2-nDx samples, the nominal weighed samples are\nground thoroughly, palletized, encapsulated in soft iron tube and put in a quartz tube inserted in a\nprogrammable furnace under flow of argon at ambient pressure. The temperature of furnace is\n2\n\n\fprogrammed to reach 850 0C over 2 hours, hold at same temperature for two and half hours, and\nsubsequently cooled to room temperature over a span of 6 hours in the same Argon atmosphere.\nThe x-ray diffraction pattern of the compound was recorded with a diffractometer using CuK\u03b1\nradiation. SEM studies were carried out on these samples using a Leo 440 (Oxford Microscopy:\nUK) instrument. The magnetoresistivity, \u03c1(T)H, was measured with H applied perpendicular to\ncurrent direction, using four-probe technique on Quantum Design PPMS. Magnetization\nmeasurements are carried out with a Quantum-Design SQUID magnetometer MPMS-7.\n\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS\nX-ray diffractions patterns show that all the samples of MgB2-nDx series are of nearly\nsingle phase with only a small quantity of un-reacted MgO in them. For highest nDx sample, i.e.,\nx = 10wt%, the main intensity peak is broadened slightly (patterns not shown). The lattice\nparameters remain nearly invariant for all the samples until x = 5wt% for MgB2-nDx. For 10 wt%\nsample, slight decrease in 'a' is seen. It means for this higher concentration some diamond\nparticles has got broken into carbon atoms, which substituted at Boron site resulting in slight\ndecrease in 'a' but at low concentration there is not such indication of breakage of n-Diamond.\nVariation of resistance with temperature under applied magnetic fields up to 8 Tesla\nR(T)H is shown in fig.1 (only transition zone). As we can see from this figure with increasing nDiamond concentration, the superconducting onset temperature remains unchanged and the\ntransition width changes slightly. This indicates that no substitution has taken place in this\nsystem. It is noted that R(T)H curves for the doped samples shifted with increasing field much\nmore slowly than the undoped one. For pure MgB2 the Tc(R = 0) value is observed at 38 and 18\nK in zero and 8 Tesla applied fields respectively. Interestingly, the Tc(R = 0) for MgB2-5wt% nD\nsample in comparison to pure MgB2 is lowered to 36 K in zero applied field, the same is\nincreased to 22 K under 8 Tesla field.\nNow, to see the effect of n-Diamond addition on the upper critical field Hc2, using\nresistivity variation under magnetic field plots we estimated the Hc2 values i.e. Hc2 obtained from\nthe 90% values of the resistive transitions. The variation of Hc2 with respect to temperature is not\nshown here (see Ref. 15), which demonstrates that on increasing the concentration of n-Diamond\na clear shift in upper direction can be achieved. The behavior of 3-wt% & 5-wt% n-Diamond\nadded samples is quite competitive; but since the Tc of 5%nD is lower than 3%nD so we can say\n\n3\n\n\fthat 5%nD sample shows better improvement in Hc2 value. The formation of nanodomains\nstructures is due to the presence of dispersed diamond in parent MgB2 grains (we have reported\nthe HRTEM and ED pattern in another paper [15]) causing the disorder in lattice. These\nnanodomains, which are comparable in size (~ 8 to 10 nm) with the coherence length of MgB2\ncould result in strong in-plane and out-of-plane scattering and contribute to the increase of Hc2\nvalue in a wide temperature regime.\nIn fig.2 the magnetic hysteresis loop for all the doped samples (x = 0%, 1%, 3%, 5%, 7%\n& 10%) at 10K is shown in applied field up to 13 Tesla. This tells that the closing of hysteresis\nloop for pure MgB2 is at ~ 6.5 Tesla whereas the same is opened up to ~11 Tesla for 3-wt%\ndoped sample. This indicates that there will be significant improvement in irreversibility field\nvalues for the doped samples. The irreversibility fields (Hirr) is the one at which the magnetic\nhysteresis loop is nearly closed with M \u2248 0. The Hirr versus x (concentration on nano diamond)\nplot is shown in inset of fig.2 at 4k, 10K & 20K. The best values of Hirr among these diamond\nadded samples (MgB2-nDx) is found for the sample with x=3%. The Hirr values for the undoped\nsamples are 7.5, 6.5 & 4.5 Tesla at 4K, 10K & 20K respectively; the same is increased up to\n13.5, 11.3 & 5.5 Tesla for the 3-wt% n-Diamond added sample, reveals that nano diamond\ndoping significantly improved the Hirr values. These results show that diamond doping enhances\nthe flux pinning strength in parent MgB2 significantly. These results are in well agreement with\npreviously reported data [16].\nUsing M(H) loop we estimated the critical current density by invoking Bean's critical\nstate formula. Fig. 3 shows the magnetic critical current density (Jc) vs applied field (H) at 20K\n& 10K. For all the samples (doped and undoped) the Jc attains the value greater than 105 A/cm2 at\nlow fields at both the temperatures. At 20K Jc falls to 100 A/cm2 at 4.5 Tesla for pure MgB2\nwhereas for rest of the samples this Jc value is reached only at nearly 6 Tesla. At 20 K the Jc is\nimproved by an order of magnitude for doped samples as compared to the pure MgB2 at high\nfields but for doped samples all the plots are merging nearly at the same field (6 Tesla) i.e. not\nmuch difference in Jc(H) behavior is seen for doped samples at higher fields. For 10K the\nsituation is quite different at higher fields i.e. the rate of Jc drop is smaller than for all samples\ncompared to undoped MgB2. The Jc is 40 times higher than pure MgB2 at 10K at 6 Tesla applied\nfield in case of 3-wt% n-Diamond added sample and Jc value is still of the order of 103 A/cm2 at\n10 Tesla for the same sample. These results are quite comparable as reported earlier [17]. The\n\n4\n\n\fbetter Jc(H) performance of n-Diamond added samples indicates towards that the additional\nimpurities at nanoscale introduced by n-Diamond serve as strong pinning centers to improve flux\npinning in higher applied fields.\nTo confirm the improved flux pinning behavior through diamond doping, the field\ndependence of normalized flux pinning force (Fp / Fp, max) is shown in fig. 4(a) & (b) at 20K &\n10K. The relationship between flux pinning force and critical current density could be described\nby [18]\nFp= \u03bc0 Jc(H) H\n\n(1)\n\nWhere \u03bc0 is the magnetic permeability in vacuum. These figures depict that the pinning forces\nare significantly improved than the pure MgB2 above 2 Tesla for n-Diamond doped samples at\nboth the temperatures because curves for the doped samples are shifted towards the higher fields,\nindicating enhanced flux pinning force in high fields. As revealed by the microstructure analysis\n[15] nano diamond particles of size around ~ 10 nm are dispersed in MgB2 matrix. Because these\nparticles have the size comparable to the coherence length of MgB2, It is highly possible that\nthey may work as point pinning centers, causing a shift of the curve in Fp / Fp,max vs H curve\ntowards the higher field. It can be seen from fig. 4(a) & (b) that the peak corresponding to 3-wt%\nn-Diamond doped sample is much broader than those of other samples, indicating highest\npinning strength in this sample at higher fields; which is consistent with the results of Jc (fig. 3).\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\n\nIn summary, the effect of nano diamond doping on critical temperature (Tc), critical\ncurrent density (Jc) and flux pinning was investigated under a wide range of magnetic field. It\nwas found that the n-Diamond addition enhances the flux pinning with modest reduction of the\nTc. Jc was enhanced by a factor of 40 in comparison to undoped sample for 3-wt% n-Diamond\nadded sample at 10K at 6 Tesla. The Hirr values for the undoped samples are 7.5, 6.5 & 4.5 Tesla\nat 4K, 10K & 20K respectively; the same is increased up to 13.5, 11.3 & 5.5 Tesla for the 3-wt%\nn-Diamond added sample. The highly dispersed nano diamond particles are acting as strong\npinning centers and are responsible for better performance of doped samples. The present work\nshows that nano diamond doping is a promising way to fabricate high performance MgB2 bulk\nmaterial with excellent values of Jc(H), Hc2 & Hirr(T).\n\n5\n\n\fACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n\nDr. Rajeev Rawat from CSR-Indore is acknowledged for the resistivity under magnetic\nfield measurements.
