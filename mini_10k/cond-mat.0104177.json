In that state, fullerene exhibits a higher resistivity than for\nnegative doping, and becomes superconducting with critical temperatures that can\nexceed 50 K, about a factor 5 higher than the corresponding negative field-doped\nstate. The general belief is that superconductivity in the fullerenes is related to\na strong intra-molecular electron-phonon coupling, connected with the Jahn-Teller\neffect of the isolated ion (Antropov et al. 1993). Unlike the negative doping case,\nwhere both calculations (Antropov et al. 1993, Varma et al. 1991, Lannoo et al.\n1991) and fits to data (Gunnarsson et al. 1995) exist, no quantitative evaluation of\nthe actual Jahn-Teller coupling strengths is so far available for the positive fullerene\nions.\nIn this work we undertake the task of determining the electron-vibration linear\ncouplings for the Hu HOMO level of the C60 molecule, along with that of spelling\nout some of the consequences for resistivity and for superconductivity. For that\npurpose we use density functional electronic structure calculations, yielding accurate\nmolecular vibration frequencies and eigenvectors for the two ag , six gg , and eight hg\nmodes that couple linearly to the electronic Hu state. Knowing the form of the JahnTeller coupling matrices, we distort the molecule and extract the coupling constants\nfrom the calculated level shifts and splittings. As a parallel check, we repeat a similar\ncalculation for the negative, electron doping case, where the ag and hg modes couple\nlinearly to the T1u LUMO level of the C60 molecule. The couplings obtained for\nnegatively doped C60 are rather similar to those that can be found in the literature,\nand just represent a fresher, state-of-the-art theoretical determination. The holevibration couplings of positively doped C60 are new, and can be put to use in a\nvariety of manners, including predicting or explaining properties of molecular ions,\nsuch as photoemission (Br\u00fchwiler et al. 1997) and IR/Raman spectra. That is a task\nthat we propose to consider in the near future.\nThe couplings obtained can also be used to determine the dimensionless electronphonon coupling constant \u03bb relevant for the superconductivity as well as for the\nvibron contribution to the high temperature T -linear resistivity in the crystalline\nphase. Comparing values for positive and negative doping we find that for positive\ndoping \u03bb is a factor 1.4 larger than for negative doping. These results provide a\nstarting point for a discussion and comparison with the experimental findings.\nThis paper is organized as follows: the notation is set up in Sect. 2; the ab-initio\ncalculation and results for the molecular ion are described is Sect. 3; in Sect. 4 we\nsketch the calculation of the resistivity in a band-degenerate case; Sect. 5 presents\na formulation for superconductivity in that case; Sect. 6 contains comparisons and\ndiscussion of experimental data.\n\n2\n\n\f2\n\nThe Jahn-Teller Hamiltonian\n\nSeveral theoretical papers (Ceulemans and Fowler 1990, De Los Rios et al. 1996,\nMoateet al. 1996, Moate et al. 1997, Manini and De Los Rios 2000) formulate the\nH \u2297 (a + g + h) Jahn-Teller (JT) and dynamical JT problem \u2013 describing a hole\nin molecular C60 \u2013 though with different notations and conventions. For ease of\ncomparison, it is therefore useful to set up explicitly the conventions we use in the\npresent calculation.\nThe analogies of the \u0011icosahedral H \u2297 (a + g + h) JT coupling to a spherical D (2) \u2297\nD (0+) + D (2+) + D (4+) model were exploited in earlier work, where among other\nthings it was shown that surprisingly, and depending on numbers, this dynamical JT\nproblem may or may not possess a Berry phase (De Los Rios et al. 1996, De Los\nRios and Manini 1997, Manini and De Los Rios 1998). The representations D (L\u00b1) of\nO(3) map into representations of the icosahedral group Ih as follows (Altmann and\nHerzig 1994): D (0\u00b1) \u2212\u2192 ag/u , D (1\u00b1) \u2212\u2192 t1 g/u , D (2\u00b1) \u2212\u2192 hg/u , D (3\u00b1) \u2212\u2192 t2 g/u \u2295 hg/u ,\nD (4\u00b1) \u2212\u2192 gg/u \u2295hg/u , and so on. This means that the decomposition of the symmetric\npart of the tensor product\n\n\u0010\n\n{D (2\u2212) \u2297 D (2\u2212) }s = D (0+) \u2295 D (2+) \u2295 D (4+)\n\n(1)\n\nbecomes in icosahedral language\n{hu \u2297 hu }s = ag \u2295 hg \u2295 (gg \u2295 hg ) .\n\n(2)\n\nag and gg appear only once, while the hg representation modes appears twice in this\ndecomposition: one represents a genuine quadrupolar D (2+) state, while the other\none derives from a D (4+) representation. Though this O(3) picture is suggestive\n(Ceulemans et al. 1994), clearly a quantitative description of Cn+\n60 ions had better\ninvolve icosahedral symmetry from the beginning.\nIn the icosahedral group indeed in the hu \u2297hu tensor product, the hg representation\nappears twice. This reflects the non-simple reducibility of the icosahedral symmetry\ngroup. Accordingly, Butler 1981 provides two independent sets of Clebsch-Gordan\n(CG) coefficients\nh m [r]\nC\u03bc,\u03bd \u2261 hH, \u03bc; H, \u03bd|h, mi[r]\n(3)\nwhich couple an H electronic state (quadratically) with an h vibrational mode (linearly) to give a scalar. Each set of coefficients is identified by a multiplicity index\nr = 1, 2. Since the two h states labeled r = 1, 2 are symmetry-wise indistinguishable,\nthe choice of these two sets of coefficients is perfectly arbitrary, as long as they are\nkept orthogonal to each other. This arbitrariness is the source of the different notations taken in the literature of this field. Here, we stick to Butler's choice (Butler\n1981), which is basically equivalent to Ceulemans' convention (Fowler and Ceulemans\n1985). Also, we label the states within a degenerate multiplet by the labels of the\nsubgroup chain Ih \u2283 D5 \u2283 C5 . For brevity, we indicate only the C5 index m (m = 0\n3\n\n\ffor ag , m = \u00b11, \u00b12 for gg and m = \u22122, . . . , 2 for hg states) in the labeling of states\nsince, for the representations relevant to our problem, the D5 label is just the absolute\nvalue of m.\nGiven the tabulated CG coefficients, it is necessary for generality to consider a\nlinear combination\nh\n\nm\nm [1]\nm [2]\nC\u03bc,\u03bd\n(\u03b1) \u2261 cos \u03b1 h C\u03bc,\u03bd\n+ sin \u03b1 h C\u03bc,\u03bd\n\n(4)\n\nm\nof the two sets. The coefficient h C\u03bc,\u03bd\n(\u03b1) coincides with Butler's r = 1 and r = 2\n\u03c0\nvalues for \u03b1 = 0 and \u03b1 = 2 respectively. Different values of \u03b1 can\nbe compared with\n\u0010 \u221a \u0011\nthe conventions of previous authors. For example, \u03b1 = \u2212 arctan 3/ 5 \u2248 \u221253.3\u25e6 is\nthe case studied by De Los Rios et al. 1996 (where the Ih CG coefficient becomes\nequivalent to the spherical h2, \u03bc; 2, \u03bd|2, mi); \u03b1 = \u03c0/2 by Moate et al. 1996; and\n\u03b1 = 0, \u03c0/2 by Ceulemans and Fowler 1990, where these cases are indicated as hb and\nha respectively. The \u03b1-dependence of these CG coefficients indicates that \u2013 unlike, for\nexample, cubic symmetry \u2013 belonging to the hg group representation in icosahedral\nsymmetry does not determine completely the form of the JT coupling. The mixing\nangle \u03b1 is also needed for that. In the present case of fullerene, each hg distortion\nmode is thus characterized not only by its frequency and scalar coupling, but also by\nits specific mixing angle \u2212\u03c0/2 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 \u03c0/2.\n\nThe basic linear Jahn-Teller Hamiltonian for the Hu \u2297 (ag + gg + hg ) model is\nconveniently divided into:\nH=\n\nX\n\n\u03c4 =ag ,gg ,hg\n\nnmodes (\u03c4 ) h\n\nX\n\ni\n\n\u03c4\n\u03c4\n~ \u03c4 i ) + He\u2212v\n~ \u03c4 i) .\nHharm\n(h\u0304\u03c9\u03c4 i , P~\u03c4 i , Q\n(g\u03c4 i h\u0304\u03c9\u03c4 i , \u03b1\u03c4 i , Q\n\ni\n\n(5)\n\nThe first term describes the linearly-coupled vibrations in the harmonic approximation,\nX 2\n\u03c4\n~ , Q)\n~ = h\u0304\u03c9\nHharm\n(h\u0304\u03c9, P\n(Pm + Q2m ) ,\n(6)\n2 m\n\nwhile the second term is the linear coupling to each mode:\n\u03c4\n~ =\nHe\u2212v\n(gh\u0304\u03c9, \u03b1, Q)\n\ngh\u0304\u03c9 X\nm\nQm c\u2020\u03bc c\u2212\u03bd \u03c4 C\u03bc,\u03bd\n(\u03b1) .\n2 m\u03bc\u03bd\n\n(7)\n\nHere, of course, the \u03b1 dependence is relevant only for the \u03c4 = hg case. The distortion coordinates Q\u03c4 im (with conjugate momentum P\u03c4 im ) are dimensionless, being\nmeasured in units of x0 (\u03c9\u03c4 i ) = (h\u0304/mC \u03c9\u03c4 i )1/2 . The operator c\u2020\u03bc creates an electron in\norbital \u03bc(= \u22122, . . . , 2) of the HOMO Hu shell.\nNaturally this form of the coupling Hamiltonian is such that each term represents\npertinent irreducible representation combinations that are totally symmetrical, i.e.,\nscalars, under the icosahedral group. For future applications, it will provide a convenient form both for perturbative calculations (small g values) and as a starting point\n4\n\n\ffor numerical diagonalization methods, such as the Lanczos technique. Here, however, we restrict ourselves to a study of the classical molecular distortions. For that,\nit is more convenient (Manini and De Los Rios 2000) to switch to a real representation\nof the vibrational degrees of freedom and orbitals.\nTo that end, we apply two standard unitary transformations (Manini and De Los\nRios 2000), one to the electronic and the other to the vibrational degrees of freedom.\nWe define a new set of electronic operators, dm (and consequently their Hermitian\nconjugates d\u2020m ), as\n\u0012\n\nc0 = d 0\n\u0013\n1\ncm\n= \u221a\nc\u2212m\n2\n\n!\u0012\n\n1 i\n1 \u2212i\n\n(8)\n\u0013\n\ndm\n, m = 1, 2 .\nd\u2212m\n\nThis transformation leaves unchanged the (diagonal) coupling to the ag modes, which\ntakes the final form:\ngh\u0304\u03c9 X \u2020\nag\nag\nq\nd\u03bc d\u03bd V\u03bc\u03bd\n,\n(9)\nHe\u2212v\n(gh\u0304\u03c9, q) =\n2\n\u03bc\u03bd\nag\n= \u03b4\u03bc\u03bd and q = Q0 .\nwith V\u03bc\u03bd\n\nThe second (similar) transformation is applied to the vibrational coordinates of the\ngg and hg modes:\n\u0012\n\nQ0 = q0\n\u0013\n(\u22121)m\nQm\n\u221a\n=\nQ\u2212m\n2\n\n(hg modes only)\n1 i\n1 \u2212i\n\n!\u0012\n\nqm\nq\u2212m\n\n\u0013\n\n(10)\n\n(m = 1, 2) .\n\nThe harmonic part is left unchanged by this transformation, while the interaction is\ntransformed into\ngh\u0304\u03c9 X X \u2020\n\u03c4\nHe\u2212v\n(gh\u0304\u03c9, \u03b1, ~q) =\nqm\nd\u03bc d\u03bd V\u03bc\u03c4\u03bd(m) (\u03b1) (\u03c4 = gg , hg ) .\n(11)\n2 m\n\u03bc\u03bd\nThe 5 \u00d7 5 coupling matrices V\u03c4 (m) are combinations\nof the CG coefficients.

The Hu \u2297\nag part has a purely diagonal coupling matrix. As it does not split the electronic\ndegeneracy, it is trivially separated from the coupling to the other modes and can be\ntreated as a displaced oscillator.\n6\n\n\fWhen a single electron (hole) is placed in the Hu orbital, the molecule distorts in\nsuch a way that the lowest (highest) BO sheet is lowered (raised) in energy as much as\npossible. The coupling to a gg mode leads to 10 equivalent absolute minima of D3 local\nsymmetry (Ceulemans and Fowler 1990, Manini and De Los Rios 2000) of the BO\npotential. The optimal distortion is realized for |qsgg | = ggg /3, with a corresponding\npotential energy lowering of gg2g h\u0304\u03c9gg /18. The r = 2 part of the coupling to the hg\nmodes (corresponding to the sin \u03b1 terms in Vhg (m) above) contributes to these same\nminima in an equivalent way, with ggg replaced by ghg sin \u03b1. However, the r = 1\ncomponent (cos \u03b1 terms in Vhg (m) ) of the coupling favours the six classical stable\nminima of local D5 symmetry (Ceulemans and Fowler 1990, Manini\u221aand De Los Rios\n2000). The optimal distortion at these minima is |qshg | = ghg cos \u03b1/ 5, for an energy\nlowering of gh2g cos2 \u03b1 h\u0304\u03c9/10.\nThe simultaneous linear coupling to several modes will generally lead to a cumulative distortion and to an energy gain which is the sum of the individual energy\ngains. However, the form of the coupling (11) prevents the molecule to gain energy\nthrough both kinds of couplings. The system shall choose between a D3 and a D5\ndistortion, depending which one is energetically more convenient for given specific\nvalues of the couplings, vibration frequencies, and Hu orbital electronic filling. The\ncalculation of the following section determines in particular which one of the two\ntypes of distortions prevails in C+\n60 .\n\n3\n\nCalculation of the couplings and results\n\nWe compute the molecular electronic structure within the density functional theory\n(DFT) in the local density approximation. The C60 molecule is repeated periodically\nin a large fcc supercell lattice. The conventional supercell side is a = 18.5 \u00c5, so\nthat the distance between the centers of two neighboring copies of the molecule is\n13.1 \u00c5, suitably much larger than the fully relaxed equilibrium (opposite C-C) ball\ndiameter, about 7.053 \u00c5. Since we aim at describing the single molecule \u2013 and indeed\nour molecules are well isolated \u2013 no sampling of the Brillouin zone is called for, and\ncalculations of the charge density are done using the k=0 wavefunctions. We use\nultrasoft pseudopotentials (Vanderbilt 1990) for C (Favot and Dal Corso 1999). The\nplane-waves basis set is cut off at Ecut = 27 Ry (charge density cutoff = 162 Ry).\nTest calculations with higher cutoff or larger cell size a gave equivalent results.\nBased on this electronic structure calculation, we used next density functional\nperturbation theory (Baroni et al. 1987) to compute three independent rows of the\ndynamical matrix. Icosahedral symmetry is then used to recover the full matrix,\nwhich determines the normal modes \u03be~i,s and frequencies \u03c9i (Giannozzi and Baroni\n1994) of the molecule. We obtained frequencies (see Table 1) in good agreement\nwith experiment (Prassides et al. 1991, Zhou et al. 1992), as well as with previous\ncalculations (Giannozzi and Baroni 1994, Negri et al. 1988, Kohanoff et al. 1992).\n7\n\n\fmode Experim.

In particular for each hg mode we selected the q0 displacement, corresponding to the totally symmetric combination \u03be~i,0 of the distortions\n\u03be~i,s with respect to an (arbitrarily chosen) D5 subgroup of the molecular symmetry\ngroup. The five initially degenerate (really, only nearly degenerate, owing to a weak\ncubic splitting due to the artificial supercell lattice) Hu Kohn-Sham eigenvalues split\nunder this distortion with a pattern given by the eigenvalues of Vhg (0) . We applied a\ndisplacement of the atomic positions along each of the eight normal-mode unit vectors, \u03be~i,0 with a prefactor ranging from -0.1 to 0.1 \u00c5. In Fig. 1 we plot as an example\nthe resulting energies for the sixth hg mode. The pattern generated by Vhg (0) should\nbe 1+2+2 (a state separated by two pairs of twofold-degenerate states). The small\nresidual splittings of these twofold degeneracies, due to the cubic crystal field and\nhigher-than-linear couplings, give an estimate of the accuracy of the method. By\nstandard linear fitting and comparison with Eq. (11), we obtained directly the linear\ndimensionless coupling coefficients ghg i \u03b1hg i collected in Table 2. We determined the\nsign of \u03b1hg i by applying a distortion along \u03be~i,1, and comparing the splitting of the\nHOMO with the eigenvalues of Vhg (1) (\u00b1\u03b1hg i ). Following the same procedure we derived the couplings for the gg modes, by applying here q\u22121 distortions.

Points: DFT data. Lines: linear fits,\ngiving the coupling parameters ghg 6 and \u03b1hg 6 of Table 2.\nlinear coupling coefficients ggg i are also collected in Table 2.\nFor convenience, we also report in Table 2 the amount of optimal JT distortion\npertinent to each mode when the HOMO level is occupied by one electron/hole,\nand the corresponding energy lowering Es for both D5 and D3 minima. Note in\nparticular the large coupling associated to the lowest hg mode, the corresponding\ndistortion leading to an energy lowering practically equal to its quantum h\u0304\u03c9.\nAdding up the JT energy gain of the individual modes, we estimate the total\nclassical potential energy lowering in C60 . The D5 minima gain Es =71 meV, while\nthe D3 minima gain only Es =22 meV (the contribution of the ag modes \u2013 2 meV \u2013\nbeing included in both cases). It is therefore apparent that the C+\n60 ion will choose,\nat least within linear coupling, the D5 distortion. As was shown in (Manini and\nDe Los Rios 2000), the possibility of a switch to a nondegenerate Au dynamical JT\nGS occurs, for large coupling strength g \u2265 6, only under the condition that the D3\nminima are energetically lower or equal to the D5 minima. This settles finally the\nissue of the dynamical JT GS symmetry of this molecular ion: it is a regular Berryphase vibronic state of symmetry Hu , like the parent electronic state (Manini and De\nLos Rios 2000).

(20) [N1 (0) = density of states per spin per band\nat the Fermi level].\nuration it is possible to distinguish individual levels within the HOMO, energy-wise.\nFigure 2 depicts the square modulus of the hole wavefunction for a D5 minimum.\nThe probability density appears to be localized on an equatorial conjugated band,\nwhere the poles are the opposite pentagons centered around the D5 axis we chose\namong the six possible ones.\nAs a check, with the same method used above to calculate the hole-vibration couplings of the HOMO (Fig. 1), we also computed the electron-vibration couplings of\nthe LUMO and obtained the values in Table 3. The total static JT potential energy\nlowering is 41 meV, of which 3 meV due to the ag modes, and 38 meV due to the\nhg modes. These values are generally in line with those calculated by previous authors (Antropov et al. 1993, Varma et al. 1991, Lannoo et al. 1991), although there\n10\n\n\fFigure 2: Electronic charge density distribution of the hole in C+\n60 at the D5 JT\nminimum along a q0 distortion of any hg mode. Out of the six equivalent ones, this\nparticular minimum is defined by the D5 axis drawn as a bold \"spit\" piercing the ball\nthrough two pentagons. The contours are drawn at 30% of the maximum density.\nare some differences in the details. Error bars in theoretical determinations of JT\ncouplings of fullerene have proven surprisingly large, possibly reflecting and amplifying errors in the vibrational eigenvectors. Of course as is well known, somewhat\nlarger energy gains are obtained when the true dynamical JT problem, including a\nfull quantum treatment of the vibrons is considered (Auerbach et al. 1994, Manini\net al. 1994). We shall leave this calculation in Cn+\n60 for future work.\nWhen more than one electron/hole occupies the HOMO of C60 , larger distortions\nand more important energy gains are expected. In particular, the ag contribution for\nCn+\n60 is simply:\nEsag (n) = n2 Esag (1),\n(12)\nwhich can become as large as 179 meV for n = 10 holes. Consider now the nontrivial\nJT part of the coupling, that to gg and hg modes. For n = 2 electrons/holes (spin\nsinglet configuration) in the HOMO orbital, the distortions simply become twice as\nlarge as in the n = 1 case, with JT energy gains which are four times larger. Even\nthough n = 1, 2 electrons/holes take advantage only of the D5 stabilization energy,\nadditional electrons/holes can benefit from the extra HOMO splitting induced by the\nhg (r = 2) plus gg coupling. To test this, we relaxed completely the molecular structure\nin the 64-dimensional space of the 8 hg and gg modes, and determined the minima of\nthe total potential energy, filling the five BO sheets as drawn in the insets of Fig. 3.\nFor simplicity we only considered at this stage low-spin configurations, generally the\nmost favored by JT. The resulting energy gains Esgg +hg (n) are reported in Fig. 3.\n11\n\n\fh\u0304\u03c9\u03c4 i coupl.\ncm\u22121 eV/a0\nag\n500 0.07\n1511 0.78\nhg\n261 0.07\n429 0.17\n718 0.26\n785 0.19\n1119 0.28\n1275 0.25\n1456 0.69\n1588 0.72\n\ng\u03c4 i\n\nqs\na0\n\nEs\nmeV\n\n\u03bb\u0303\nmeV\n\n0.157 0.01\n0.340 0.01\n\n0.2\n2.7\n\n0.4\n5.4\n\n0.412\n0.489\n0.350\n0.224\n0.193\n0.138\n0.315\n0.289\n\n2.7\n6.3\n5.5\n2.4\n2.6\n1.5\n9.0\n8.2\n\n13.7\n31.7\n27.3\n12.2\n12.9\n7.6\n44.8\n41.2\n\n0.08\n0.07\n0.04\n0.03\n0.02\n0.01\n0.03\n0.02\n\nTable 3: Computed mode eigenfrequencies and e-v linear coupling parameters for the\nT1u LUMO of C60 . For each mode, we report The JT distortion magnitudes qs , the\nclassical stabilization energies Es , and the contribution to \u03bb\u0303 = \u03bb/N1[0].\nThe energy lowering is maximum for n = 4 (and n = 6): it is as large as 401 meV,\ncompared to a modest Eshg (n = 2, 4) = 153 meV in C\u2212\n60 . Similarly to what happens in\nthe T1u LUMO case (see Fig. 3 and Manini et al. 1994), the half-filled configuration\nn = 5 is slightly unfavorable (by JT energetics) with respect to the neighboring\nn = 4 and n = 6 states. We find that the contributions of the gg modes, strictly\nzero for n = 1, 2, are small (\u223c 1 meV) but nonzero in the 3 \u2264 n \u2264 7 configurations.\nThis indicates that for such large fillings the many-modes JT system (Manini and\nTosatti 1998) can take some advantage also of the \"losing\" gg + hg (r = 2) part of\nthe coupling (favoring D3 minima for n = 1, 2). The insets of Fig. 3, indicate that\nthe largest displacement of a single level in the Hu HOMO, about 0.28 eV, is realized\nfor n = 2. Finally, we have particle-hole symmetry Esgg +hg (n) = Esgg +hg (10 \u2212 n), at\nan opposite minimum distortion ~qs (n) = \u2212~qs (10 \u2212 n). For the special case n = 5 this\nmeans that the configuration drawn in the inset and the one obtained reflecting the\n5 levels through zero give both the same optimal energy (at opposite distortions).\nApplication of the above results to real Cn+\n60 must await the inclusion of electronelectron Coulomb repulsion. Coulomb interactions will generally compete with JT\ncoupling and favor high-spin configurations, which, in turn, are generally less favorable for JT. (For example for n = 2 the triplet configurations has a JT gain of\n100 meV instead of 277 meV for the singlet.) We shall return to a more detailed\ndescription of Cn+\n60 ions in later work.\n\n12\n\n\fJT energy gain (eV)\n\n0\n\nC60\n\nn\u2212\n\n\u22120.2\n\nC60\n\nn+\n\n\u22120.4\n.2\n0\n.\n\u22122\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nn\nFigure 3: The static JT energy gain (excluding the ag modes contribution) of Cn+\n60 ,\nas a function of the filling n of the Hu molecular level.

We are interested in particular to the features of an\norbitally degenerate band as in the charged C60 case.

(20) and the calculated e-v coupling parameters of Table 2, we find\nfor holes in the Hu HOMO-derived band\n\u03bb\u0303+ \u2243 0.277 eV.\n\n(22)\n\nThis value can be compared with that calculated similarly, using our couplings of\nTable 3 for electrons in the T1u band\n\u03bb\u0303\u2212 \u2243 0.197 eV.\n\n(23)\n\nWe conclude therefore that holes have a stronger scattering with intra-molecular\noptical phonons than electrons, by about a factor 1.4.\nTo confirm the accuracy of the values computed for the HOMO case, it is useful to\ncompare those for the LUMO with previous similar calculations. It is then necessary\nto take into account the factor d = 3 which is usually incorporated in the total density\nof states (Lannoo et al. 1991). Our \u03bb\u0303/d = 66 meV compares well with previous similar\ncalculations for the C60 LUMO (Antropov et al. 1993, Varma et al. 1991, Lannoo et\nal. 1991), ranging from 49 to 68 meV. On the other hand, empirical estimates based\non a fit to photoemission data tend to give a value as large as 147 meV (Gunnarsson\net al. 1995). The origin of this discrepancy is presently unclear.\n\n5\n\nSuperconductivity\n\nThe dimensionless electron-vibron coupling which governs the transport properties, \u03bb\nof Eqs. (20,21), is not in point of principle coincident with the parameter \u03bb determining the superconducting properties. The latter must be determined by solving the\n15\n\n\fMigdal-Eliashberg equation with the retarded interaction mediated by the vibrons\nplus the electron-electron Coulomb repulsion. However, a simple estimate of the order of magnitude of \u03bb can be obtained by taking the unretarded limit, and imposing\na Debye cutoff to the electron energies. We assume the electronic band operators to\nbe related to the molecular creation and annihilation operators through the unitary\n(orthogonal) transformation\n\u22121\ncnk\u03c3 = Un\u03bc\n(k) d\u03bck\u03c3 ,\n\nn being the band index, \u03c3 the spin.

That, in turn, increases the critical temperature relative\nto a situation in which the pairs do not interfere. We may therefore foresee two\nopposite limits of strongly interfering and of non interfering pairs which, respectively,\nover and underestimate the effective coupling strength \u03bb.\nIf we assume that averages over the Fermi surface do not depend on the band\nindices (interfering pairs, corresponding, for example, to the choice of Lannoo et al.\n1991), then we can replace W with W, and we find that the critical temperature is\n16\n\n\fdetermined by the maximum eigenvalue of the matrix W in Eq.

We note that, even though\n\u221a the matrices W ,\nfor different \u03c4 's, do not commute, the eigenvector (1, 1, 1, 1, 1)/ 5 is an eigenstate of\neach of them.

This means that the totally-symmetric paired state, delocalized\nover all the five Hu orbitals or bands, is favored by the couplings to all modes. It also\nimplies that, contrary to molecular JT, the couplings to all modes cooperate evenly to\nthis superconducting state, and contribute additively to \u03bb. Totally equivalent (even\nif at first sight apparently different) results were derived for the d = 3 case (K3 C60 )\nin Refs. (Lannoo et al. 1991, Rice et al. 1991). We note, however, that the claim\nthat orbital degeneracy enhances the superconducting \u03bb through a factor d (Rice et\nal. 1991) is not really justified, as one must at the same time reduce the density of\nstates from total to single-band, a factor 1/d smaller.

(20).\nIf, in the opposite limit, the pairs did not interfere between different bands, the\neffective \u03bb would be reduced by a factor d. Although we cannot identify a physical\nsituation corresponding to this limit, we can assume that a general case will be\nintermediate between the limits (interfering/not-interfering pairs). For simplicity, we\nwill stick here to the interfering limit.\nIn summary, is there any enhancement of superconductivity due to orbital degeneracy? We can still identify one possible source for that, namely Coulomb pseudopotential. In fact, we note that, although a large \u03bb due to tunneling of the Cooper pairs\nbetween different orbitals/bands, can be seen as orbital degeneracy enhancing the\neffective \u03bb to the highest eigenvalue of W, there is no corresponding enhancement\nof the repulsive Coulomb pseudo-potential \u03bc\u2217 , at least within the Migdal-Eliashberg\ntheory. The reason is that the main contribution to the Coulomb pseudo-potential is\na charge-charge repulsion which does not include tunneling processes between different bands, and being band-diagonal it does not get enhanced. In conclusion, in the\nabove restricted sense, orbital degeneracy may in principle favor superconductivity.\n\n6\n\nDiscussion\n\nWe have presented a density functional calculation of the linear coupling of holes/electrons in the Hu and T1u orbitals of the fullerene molecule to the intra-molecular\nvibrations. The coupling to holes is strongest for the hg modes, and among those\nto the lowest-frequency mode hg (1) around 270 cm\u22121 . The linear static Jahn Teller\ndistortion predicted for C+\n60 by these couplings corresponds to a D5 distortion, with\nan energy gain of 71 meV.\nThe corresponding dynamical JT state expected with the calculated coupling parameters is a regular Berry-phase vibronic state of symmetry Hu , like the parent\nelectronic state (Manini and De Los Rios 2000). There is no level crossing to a nondegenerate Au state, as would have hypothetically been possible on pure symmetry\ngrounds, had the D3 minima been the stable ones (Manini and De Los Rios 2000).\nIn order to connect with important solid state properties including transport and\nsuperconductivity we have formulated a theory of the Boltzmann relaxation time,\nand of the BCS-type pairing, suitable for an orbitally degenerate multiband case\nwith Jahn Teller coupling. This confirms that the same parameter \u03bb determines both\ntransport and superconducting properties of the multiband degenerate solid. As we\npreviously observed, not all the computed gi (Table 2) are small parameters, and thus\nweak-coupling BCS theory is strictly not applicable for Cn+\n60 . However, the overall \u03bb is\nstill moderate. Our calculation neglects couplings to acoustic phonons and librations,\nwhich in principle should also contribute to e-ph scattering. In addition, similarly to\n18\n\n\fLannoo et al.'s calculation (Lannoo et al. 1991), we assume that the dispersion of\nthe HOMO band and of the optical phonons has a negligible effect on the integrated\nvalue of \u03bb. (This assumption was tested and proved correct in Ref. (Antropov et al.\n1993) for the couplings to the LUMO band.) With all these approximations, Eq. (27)\nshould provide a semi-quantitative estimate of the total e-ph scattering.\nAssuming conservatively a total average density of states of \u223c 10/0.6 eV \u2248 17 states eV\u22121 for the HOMO band (i.e. a single-band density of states N1 (0) = 1.7 states eV\u22121 per band per spin), our calculated effective dimensionless \u03bb+ for hole superconductivity in C60 is in conclusion about \u03bb+ \u2248 0.47. The Coulomb pseudopotential\n\u03bc\u2217 is not available yet, but possibly in the same range of values as for negative C60\n[\u03bc\u2217 \u223c 0.2\u00f70.3 (Gunnarsson et al. 1995, Gunnarsson and Zwicknagl 1992)]. With this\nvalue of \u03bb+ , weak coupling would predict Tc \u223c 1.14 h\u0304\u03c9D kB\u22121 exp[\u22121/(\u03bb+ \u2212\u03bc\u2217 )] \u223c 40 K\nfor \u03bc\u2217 = 0.2, and Tc \u223c 5 K for \u03bc\u2217 = 0.3 (assuming a typical phonon energy \u03c9D of\nabout 1500 K). This seems of the correct order of magnitude, although somewhat\non the low side, in comparison with Tc = 52 K found experimentally. However, it is\ndifficult to justify weak coupling in this case.\nThe corresponding value \u03bb\u2212 which we obtain for electrons in the T1u orbitals is,\nassuming the same bandwidth of 0.6 eV, thus again N1 (0) = 1.7 states eV\u22121 per\nband per spin for the T1u band, \u03bb\u2212 \u2248 0.33. The factor \u03bb+ /\u03bb\u2212 = 1.4 of holes relative\nto electrons is in qualitative agreement with a larger Tc of the former. Assuming\nthe same typical phonon frequency, BCS would predict here Tc \u223c 0.8 K for \u03bc\u2217 =\n0.2, and Tc \u223c 0 K for \u03bc\u2217 = 0.3. That is obviously way smaller than the observed\nsuperconducting Tc = 10 K found experimentally in the field emission transistor (FET)\nexperiment, let alone the higher values found in the fullerides.\nComing to transport, the measured resistivities for holes are larger than those of\nelectrons, and this also agrees with a larger \u03bb value. Calculation of the T -linear high\ntemperature resistivity\n\u03bbtr T\n\u03c1=\n4\u03c0\u03c9p2\nwould however predict a moderately larger value for hole- than for electron-doped\nC60 , at least assuming (somewhat arbitrarily) the same plasma frequencies for the\nsame carrier densities. Quantitatively, Batlogg's FET data (Sch\u00f6n et al. 2000) differ\nstrongly from this expectation. They, first of all, indicate a nonlinear temperature\ndependence, closer to T 2 ; secondly, they show values about 5 times larger for holes\nthan for electrons. While there are second order processes (see Appendix) that would\nindeed yield a T 2 resistivity at low temperatures, we do not believe that they may\nexplain the discrepancy here. Zettl and coworkers (Vareka and Zettl 1994) proposed\nthat the apparent T 2 in the electron resistivity is an effect of thermal expansion, and\nshowed that a linear T increase is recovered at constant volume, for negative doping.\nRecently Goldoni et al. measured by EELS the plasma frequency in K3 C60 . They\nfound it slowly decreasing with temperature, its width growing approximately quadrat19\n\n\fically with T . These data support the view that the T 2 resistivity is directly related\nwith a T \u22122 decrease of relaxation time, most likely linked with lattice expansion.\nIt seems plausible that a similar physics could apply to holes too, in which case\nthe predicted constant-pressure relaxation-time drop with temperature would also be\nnon-linear, and quantitatively larger than the electron case. If, on the other hand, it\nbecame possible to obtain the constant-volume inverse relaxation time and resistivity,\nthen, assuming the same plasma frequency \u03c9p , its increase should be linear with T\nwith a slope 1.4 times larger than that of negatively-charged C60 . This conjecture\nmust await experimental test.\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe are indebted to B. Batlogg, O. Gunnarsson and G. Santoro for useful discussions.

Indeed, at second order, the electron-vibron coupling generates an\neffective electron-electron interaction. Since the electrons involved lie on a shell of\nwidth T around the Fermi energy, the vibron-originated electron-electron interaction\nVel\u2212el (\u03c9) = \u2212\n\ng\u03c42i h\u0304\u03c9\u03c4 i \u03c9\u03c42i\n4 \u03c9\u03c42i \u2212 \u03c9 2\n\u03c4,i,m\nX\n\n1 X X X \u03c4 (m)\n\u03c4 (m)\nV\n(\u03b1)V\u03b3\u03b2 (\u03b1)d\u2020\u03bc,\u03c3,k+q d\u2020\u03b3,\u03c3\u2032 ,p d\u03b2,\u03c3\u2032 ,p+q d\u03bd,\u03c3,k , (32)\nV kpq \u03bc\u03bd\u03b3\u03b2 \u03c3,\u03c3\u2032 \u03bc\u03bd\nacts as if it were effectively unretarded, \u03c9 = 0.
