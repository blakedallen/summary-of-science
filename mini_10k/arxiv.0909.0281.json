Actually, a distinctive\nfeature of cosmology of a scalar field confined to a RS\nbrane is that the expansion rate of the universe differs\nat high energy from that predicted by standard general\nrelativity. This is due to a term quadratic in the energy\ndensity, that produces enhancing of the friction acting on\nthe scalar field. This means that, in RS braneworld cosmology, inflation is possible for a wider class of potentials\nthan in standard cosmology [1]. Even potentials that are\nnot sufficiently flat from the point of view of the conventional inflationary paradigm can produce successful\ninflation. At sufficiently low energies (much less than the\nbrane tension), the standard cosmic behavior is recovered\nprior to primordial nucleosynthesis scale (T \u223c 1 M eV )\nand a natural exit from inflation ensues as the field accelerates down its potential [2].1 Another interesting feature\nof this scenario is that the inflaton does not necessarily\nneed to decay; it may survive through the present epoch\nin the cosmic evolution. Therefore, it may also play the\nrole of the quintessence field, which is a necessary ingredient to explain the current acceleration of the expansion\n\nd Part\n\nof the Instituto Avanzado de Cosmolog\u0131\u0301a (IAC) collaboration\nhttp://www.iac.edu.mx/\na Electronic address: yoelsy@uclv.edu.cu\nb Electronic address: dgm@uclv.edu.cu\nc Electronic address: tame@uclv.edu.cu\ne Electronic address: tmatos@fis.cinvestav.mx\nf Electronic address: israel@uclv.edu.cu\n1 In this scenario, reheating arises naturally and radiation is\ncreated through gravitational particle production [3] and/or\nthrough curvaton reheating [4]. This last ingredient improves\nthe brane \"steep\" inflationary picture [5]. Other mechanisms\nsuch as preheating, for instance, have also been explored [6].\n\nof the universe. Such a unified theoretical framework for\nthe description of both inflaton and quintessence with\nthe help of just one single scalar field has been the target\nof some works (see for instance Refs. [2, 7, 8, 9, 10]).\nAnother braneworld model that has received much attention in the last years, is the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati\n(DGP) model. It describes a brane with 4D worldvolume, that is embedded into a flat 5D bulk, and allows for infrared (IR)/large scale modifications of gravitational laws. A distinctive ingredient of the model is\nthe induced Einstein-Hilbert action on the brane, that\nis responsible for the recovery of 4D Einstein gravity at\nmoderate scales, even if the mechanism of this recovery\nis rather non-trivial [11]. The acceleration of the expansion at late times is explained here as a consequence of\nthe leakage of gravity into the bulk at large (cosmological) scales, so it is just a 5D geometrical effect,unrelated\nto any kind of mysterious \"dark energy\". As with many\nIR modifications of gravity, there are ghosts modes in\nthe spectrum of the theory [12].2 Nevertheless, studying the dynamics of DGP models continues being a very\nattractive subject of research. It is due, in part, to the\nvery simple geometrical explanation to the \"dark energy\nproblem\", and, in part, to the fact that it is one of a very\nfew possible consistent IR modifications of gravity that\nmight be ever found.\nAim of this paper is to extend the study of references\n[14, 15] \u2013 the investigation of the dynamics of a selfinteracting scalar field trapped on a DGP brane, and on\na RS braneworld, respectivley \u2013 to include a wide variety of self-interaction potentials beyond the constant and\n\n2\n\nIn fact there are ghosts only in one of the branches of the\nDGP model; the so called \"self-accelerating\" branch, or selfaccelerating cosmological phase [13]. The Minkowski cosmological phase is free of ghosts.\n\n\f2\nexponential potentials. This goal will allow us to make\nconclusive arguments in favour of (or against) the claim\nmade in [10] about the genericity of unification of the\ninflaton and of the quintessence in the Randall-Sundrum\nscenario. We expect a similar result regarding genericity\nof gravitational screening of the potential energy of the\nscalar field within the DGP brane context.\nAs in references [14, 15] here we make use of the dynamical systems tools to retrieve useful information on\nthe asymptotic properties of the models under study [16].\nIn order to be able to analyze self-interaction potentials\nbeyond the exponential one we will rely on a method\nproposed recently in the reference [17].\nThe organization of the paper is as it follows. In section II we provide important details about the RandallSundrum model. These include the field equations, the\nphase space variables chosen, and the mathematical definition of the phase space itself. The same features, this\ntime for the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati braneworld model,\nare given in section III. The results of the study of the\ncorresponding critical points and their stability properties are shown in section IV. The section V is aimed at\nthe physical discussion of the above results, while the\nconclusions are given in section VI. Through the paper\nwe use natural units (8\u03c0G = 8\u03c0/m2P l = ~ = c = 1).\n\nII.\n\nTHE RANDALL-SUNDRUM MODEL\n\nWe will be concerned here with the dynamics of a selfinteracting scalar field with an arbitrary self-interaction\npotential, that is trapped in a Randall-Sundrum brane of\ntype 2 (RS2). The field equations \u2013 using the FriedmannRobertson-Walker (FRW) metric \u2013 are the following:\n\n3H 2 = \u03c1T (1 +\n\n\u03c1T\n),\n2\u03bb\n\n\u03c1T\n2\u1e22 = \u2212(1 +\n)(\u03c6\u03072 + \u03b3\u03c1m ),\n\u03bb\n\u03c1\u0307m = \u22123\u03b3H\u03c1m, \u03c6\u0308 + \u2202\u03c6 V = \u22123H \u03c6\u0307.\n\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03bb is the brane tension, \u03b3 is the barotropic index of\nthe background fluid, \u03c1T = \u03c1\u03c6 + \u03c1m and V is the scalar\nfield self-interaction potential.\nFollowing [15] we introduce the following dimensionless\nphase space variables in order to build an autonomous\nsystem out of the above system of cosmological equations:\n\u221a\n\u03c1T\nV\n\u03c6\u0307\n, y\u2261\u221a\n, z\u2261\n.\nx\u2261 \u221a\n3H 2\n6H\n3H\n\n(4)\n\nAfter this choice of phase space variables we can write\nthe following autonomous system of ordinary differential\nequations (ODE):\n\nr\n\n3 2\ny (\u2202\u03c6 ln V ) \u2212 3x +\n2\n3\nx[2x2 + \u03b3(1 \u2212 x2 \u2212 y 2 )],\n2\nr\n3\n\u2032\ny =\n(\u2202\u03c6 ln V )xy +\n2\n3\ny[2x2 + \u03b3(1 \u2212 x2 \u2212 y 2 )],\n2\nz \u2032 = 3(1 \u2212 z)(2x2 + \u03b3(z \u2212 x2 \u2212 y 2 )),\n\u2032\n\nx =\u2212\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n(7)\n\nwhere the comma denotes derivative with respect to the\nnew time variable (\u03c4 \u2261 ln a). Notice that, after the above\nchoice of variables one can realize that\n\u03c1T\n2(1 \u2212 z)\n=\n, \u21d2 0 < z \u2264 1.\n\u03bb\nz\n\n(8)\n\nThis means that the four-dimensional (4D)/low-energy\nlimit of the Randall-Sundrum cosmological equations \u2013\ncorresponding to the formal limit \u03bb \u2192 \u221e \u2013 can be associated with the value z = 1. The high-energy limit\n\u03bb \u2192 0, on the contrary, corresponds to z \u2192 0. The\ncritical points associated with z = 0, if any, have to be\nanalyzed carefully. Actually, in connection with the classical character of the underlying theory of gravity, the\nphysical meaning of these points in phase space has to\nbe taken with caution due to the high energies associated with them.\nAs long as one considers just constant and exponential self-interaction potentials (\u2202\u03c6 V = 0 and \u2202\u03c6 V =\nconst respectively), the equations (5-7) form a closed\nautonomous system of ordinary differential equations.\nHowever, if one wants to go further to consider a wider\nclass of self-interaction potentials beyond the exponential\none, the system of ordinary differential equations (5-7) is\nnot a closed system of equations any more, since, in general, \u2202\u03c6 V is a function of the scalar field \u03c6. A way out\nof this difficulty can be based on the method developed\nin [17].\nIn order to be able to consider arbitrary self-interaction\npotentials one needs to consider one more variable s, that\nis related with the derivative of the self-interaction potential through s \u2261 \u2212\u2202\u03c6 V /V = \u2212\u2202\u03c6 ln V . Hence, an\nextra equation\n\u221a\ns\u2032 = \u2212 6xs2 (\u0393 \u2212 1),\n\n(9)\n\nhas to be added to the above autonomous system of equations. The quantity \u0393 \u2261 V \u2202\u03c62 V /(\u2202\u03c6 V )2 in equation (9) is,\nin general, a function of \u03c6. The idea behind the method\nin [17] is that \u0393 can be written as a function of the variable s \u2208 R+ , and, perhaps, of several constant parameters. Indeed, for a wide class of potentials the above\nrequirement: \u0393 = \u0393(s), is fulfilled, see Table I.\n\n\f3\nAs in [17] we introduce a new function f (s) = \u0393(s) \u2212 1\nso that equation (9) can be written in the more compact\nform:\n\u221a\ns\u2032 = \u2212 6xs2 f (s).\n\n(10)\n\nEquations (5-7,10) form a four-dimensional closed autonomous system of ordinary differential equations, that\ncan be safely studied with the help of the standard dynamical systems tools [16].\nThe phase space for the autonomous dynamical system\ndriven by the evolution equations (5-7,10) can be defined\nas it follows:\n\nmodel with constant and exponential potentials, exclusively. The study of other potentials was not considered.\nAs in the former section, following a method developed in [17], here we extend the analysis of the threedimensional autonomous system of reference [14], to fourdimensions, through the addition of the extra-variable\ns \u2261 \u2212\u2202\u03c6 V /V defined in the former section. This will\npermit us to consider a wider class of self-interaction potentials beyond the exponential one. In consequence, to\nthe system of equations of [14], we add (10), so that we\nare left with the following autonomous closed system of\nordinary differential equations:\n\n2\n\nx =\n\n2\n\n\u03a8 = {(x, y, z) : 0 \u2264 x + y \u2264 z,\n\u22121 \u2264 x \u2264 1, 0 \u2264 y, 0 < z \u2264 1} \u00d7 {s \u2208 R+ }. (11)\n\nIII.\n\nTHE DVALI-GABADADZE-PORRATI\nMODEL\n\nIn this section we will focus our attention in a\nbraneworld model where a self-interacting scalar field is\ntrapped on a DGP brane. In the flat FRW metric, the\nfield equations are the following:\n\u03c6\u03072\n1\n(\u03c1m +\n+ V (\u03c6)),\n3\n2\n= \u22123\u03b3H\u03c1m, \u03c6\u0308 + \u2202\u03c6 V = \u22123H \u03c6\u0307.\n\nQ2 =\n\n(12)\n\n\u03c1\u0307m\n\n(13)\n\nwhere \u03c1m is the energy density of the background\nbarotropic fluid (\u03b3 is its barotropic index), V its selfinteraction potential, \u03c6 is the scalar field trapped in the\nDGP brane, and\n1\nQ2\u00b1 \u2261 H 2 \u00b1 H,\nrc\n\n(14)\n\nwhere, as customary, rc is the crossover scale inherent in\nthe DGP brane model. There are two possible branches\nof the DGP model corresponding to the two possible\nchoices of the signs in (14): \"+\" is for the Minkowski\ncosmological phase of DGP model \u2013 that is free of ghosts\n\u2013, while \"-\" is for the self-accelerating solution.\nFollowing the reference [14] we define the phase space\ndimensionless variables:\n\u221a\nQ\n\u03c6\u0307\nV\nx\u2261 \u221a , y\u2261 \u221a , z\u2261 .\nH\n6Q\n3Q\n\nr\n\n3 2\ny zs \u2212 3x +\n2\n3\nx[2x2 + \u03b3(1 \u2212 x2 \u2212 y 2 )],\n2\nr\n3\n\u2032\ny =\u2212\nxyzs +\n2\n3\ny[2x2 + \u03b3(z \u2212 x2 \u2212 y 2 )],\n2\n3 z2 \u2212 1 2\n[2x + \u03b3(z \u2212 x2 \u2212 y 2 )],\nz\u2032 = z 2\n2 z +1\n\u221a\ns\u2032 = \u2212 6xs2 f (s),\n\u2032\n\n(16)\n\n(17)\n(18)\n(19)\n\nwhere, as before, the comma denotes\nderivative with reR\nspect to the time variable \u03c4 \u2261 Hdt, and f (s) = \u0393(s)\u22121\n(\u0393 \u2261 V \u2202\u03c62 V /(\u2202\u03c6 V )2 ).\nAfter the above choice of phase space variables, the\nequation (14) can be put into the following form:\n\nz2 = 1 \u00b1\n\n1\n.\nrc H\n\n(20)\n\n.\nFor the Minkowski phase, since 0 \u2264 H \u2264 \u221e (we consider just non-contracting universes), then 1 \u2264 z \u2264 \u221e.\nThe case \u2212\u221e \u2264 z \u2264 \u22121 corresponds to the time reversal of the later situation. For the self-accelerating phase,\n\u2212\u221e \u2264 z 2 \u2264 1, but since we want real valued z only, then\n0 \u2264 z 2 \u2264 1.3 As before, the case \u22121 \u2264 z \u2264 0 represents time reversal of the case 0 \u2264 z \u2264 1 that will be\ninvestigated here. Both branches share the common subset (x, y, z = 1), which corresponds to the formal limit\nrc \u2192 \u221e (see equation (14)), i.e., this represents just the\nstandard four-dimensional behaviour typical of EinsteinHilbert theory coupled to a self-interacting scalar field.\nThe phase space for the autonomous system (16-19),\nfor the \"+\" branch can be defined as:\n\n(15)\n\nThe corresponding autonomous system of equations in\nthe variables x, y and z, defined above, was used in [14] to\nstudy the asymptotic properties of the DGP-quintessence\n\n3\n\nIn fact, fitting SN observations requires H \u2265 rc\u22121 in order to\nachieve late time acceleration (see, for instance, reference [12]\nand references therein). This means that z has to be real-valued.\n\n\f4\nTABLE I: Explicit form of the function \u0393 for several quintessential potentials.\n\u0393(s)\n1+\n2\n\n1\n\u03b1\n\n\u2212\n\n2\n\nPotential\n\u03b1\u03bb2\ns2\n\n\u221a\n\ns +2ms +8m\u03bb+s\n2ms2\n\n1\u2212\n\n1\n2\u03b1\n\n+\n\nReference\n\nV = V0 sinh\u2212\u03b1 (\u03bb\u03c6)\n\ns2 +8m\u03bb\n\nV = V0 exp[\u03bb\u03c6\n\u03c6m\n\n2\n\n\u03b1\u03bb\n2s2\n\n2\n\n[18]\n\n]\n\n[19]\n\nV = V0 [cosh(\u03bb\u03c6) \u2212 1]\n\np\n\n[20]\n\n\u2212 \u03ba[\u03ba\u03b1\u03b2+s(\u03b1+\u03b2)]\ns2\n\nV = V0 [exp(\u03b1\u03ba\u03c6) + exp(\u03b2\u03ba\u03c6)]\n\n[21]\n\n\u2212 \u03bbs\n\nV = V0 exp(\u2212\u03bb\u03c6) + \u039b\n\n[22]\n\nTABLE II: Properties of the critical points for the autonomous system (5-7,10).\nPi\n\nx\n\ny\n\nz\n\ns\n\nExistence\n\n\u03a9\u03c6\n\nw\u03c6\n\nP1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\ns\n\nAlways\n\n0\n\nundefined\n\nP2\n\n0\n\ny \u2208]0, 1]\n\ny2\n\n0\n\n\"\n\ny2\n\n\u22121\n\n\u22121\n\nP3\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n\"\n\n1\n\n\u22121\n\n\u22121\n\nP4\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\n\"\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\nP5 \u00b1\n\n\u22131\n\n0\n\n1\n\ns\u2217\n\n\"\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\nP6\nP7\n\ns\u2217\n\u221a\n6\n\u221a\n6\u03b3\n2s\u2217\n\nq\n\nq\n\n6\u2212(s\u2217 )2\n6\n\n1\n\ns\u2217\n\ns2\u2217 \u2264 6\n\n1\n\n(s\u2217 )2 \u22123\n3\n\nq\n\n3\u03b3(2\u2212\u03b3)\n2s2\n\u2217\n\n1\n\ns\u2217\n\ns2\u2217 \u2265 3\u03b3\n\n3\u03b3\n(s\u2217 )2\n\n\u03b3\u22121\n\n\u22121 +\n\n1\n(\u22122\n2\n\n3\u03b3\n2\n\n+ s2\u2217 )\n\n\u22121 +\n\n3\u03b3\n2\n\nIV.

The self-accelerating\nsolution H = 1/rc (Q\u2212 = 0 \u21d2 z = 0) has been studied\nin [14]. In that reference the analysis of the critical points\nof the quintessence model under study was based on a\nconcrete form of the self-interaction potential. Here, as\nin the former section, we use the approach proposed in\n[17] to investigate the critical points of the dynamical\nsystem for arbitrary functions f (s), so that, in principle,\nwe are able to study arbitrary self-interaction potentials.\n\nThe Randall-Sundrum braneworld\n\nThe critical points of system (5-7,10) are summarized\nin table II. The eigenvalues of the corresponding jacobian\nmatrices are shown in table III. In both cases s\u2217 is the\nvalue which makes the function f (s) vanish, i. e., f (s\u2217 ) =\n0.

From\nthe table of eigenvalues, notice, besides, that there are\nfour non-hyperbolic critical points/sets of critical points\n(at least one of the eigenvalues is vanishing): P1 , P2 , P3 ,\nand P4 .\nWe recall that four-dimensional effects are associated\nwith points belonging in the plane (x, y, z = 1). For\npoints with z 6= 1, five-dimensional effects affect the\ndynamics of the universe. There is only a set of critical points with z 6= 1 (represented by P2 in table II):\n(x, y, z, s) = (0, y, y 2 , 0). For points in this set, since\nx = 0, z = y 2 , while \u03c1T = V , then the Friedmann equation can be written in the form:\n\n3H 2 = V\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\nV\n1+\n.\n2\u03bb\n\n(23)\n\nFor values of the potential much\u221alarger than the brane\ntension V \u226b \u03bb \u21d2 HRS = V / 6\u03bb, so that the early\ntime/high energy expansion rate in the Randall-Sundrum\nmodel (HRS ) gets enhanced with respect to the general\nrelativity rate:\nHRS\n=\nHGR\n\nr\n\nV\n.\n2\u03bb\n\n(24)\n\nThis is the way brane effects fuel early inflation in the\nRS model. The fact that this is a critical point in the\nphase space of the RS model means that, helping inflation to happen is a generic feature of Randall-Sundrum\nbraneworld models. For a further discussion about this\nsee [15].\nThe rest of the critical points of the dynamical system (5-7,10) lie on the plane (x, y, 1), so that, only fourdimensional behavior can be associated with them.

Critical points P2 \u2212 P4 have been exhaustively\nstudied in [14].\nPoints P5\u00b1 are saddle critical points. These correspond\nto the solution dominated by the kinetic energy of the\nscalar field (\u03a9\u03c6 = 1). This result differs from the one\nin standard four-dimensional theory, where the kinetic\nenergy-dominated solution can be a past attractor (an\nunstable source point) for trajectories in the phase space.\nThe non-hyperbolic point P3 has a two-dimensional\nstable subspace, which corresponds to a late-time attractor solution (3H 2 = V ).\nThere are other two critical points that can be associated with late-time attractor solutions: P6 and P7 . For\nvalues s2\u2217 < 3\u03b3 (s\u2217 df > 0), the scalar field-dominated\nsolution (point P6 ) is the future attractor of the autonomous system (5-7,10). The scaling solution (point\nP7 ) is the late-time attractor whenever it exists.\nDue to the fact that there are several non-hyperbolic\ncritical points which can not be consistently studied\nwith the help of the present linear analisys, we choose\nseveral concrete examples \u2013 corresponding to different\nquintessence potentials of cosmological interest \u2013 in order\nto illustrate, in the phase space, the dynamical behavior\nof the corresponding RS model, including the neighbourhood of these non-hyperbolic critical points.\n\n1.\n\nV = V0 [sinh(\u03bb\u03c6)]\u2212\u03b1\n\nThis potential was studied for the first time in [24],\nwhere it was shown to be a new cosmological tracker\nsolution for quintessence. For this potential the function\nf (s) = 1/\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b1\u03bb2 /s2 , while\n\n\f6\n\ns\u2217 = \u00b1\u03b1\u03bb, df =\n\n2\u03b1\u03bb2\n.\ns3\u2217\n\n(25)\n\nThe scalar field-dominated solution (set of points P6\nin tables II and III) is a late-time attractor whenever\n\u03bb2 \u2264 3\u03b3/\u03b12 , and \u03b1 > 0. It is consistent with accelerated\nexpansion if \u03bb2 < 2/\u03b12 , and \u03b1 > 0. Since s\u2217 = \u00b1\u03b1\u03bb, P7\nis a stable node:\n\u03b1\u03bb\nx+ = + \u221a , y+ =\n6\n\nr\n\n\u03b1\u03bb\nx\u2212 = \u2212 \u221a , y\u2212 =\n6\n\n6 \u2212 \u03b12 \u03bb2\n, z+ = 1, s+ = +\u03b1\u03bb\n6\n\nr\n\n6 \u2212 \u03b12 \u03bb2\n, z\u2212 = 1, s = \u2212\u03b1\u03bb\n6\n\nTherefore, whenever the condition 3\u03b3/\u03b12 < \u03bb2 < 6/\u03b12\n(\u03b1 > 0) holds true, the matter-scaling solution dominates the late-time evolution of the universe. In fig.1\nthis behaviour is illustrated for an arbitrary set of initial\nconditions. For \u03b1 > 0, and \u03bb2 > \u03b162 , the matter-scaling\nsolution is a stable spiral. It is the late-time attractor in\nthis case.\nr\n\u221a\n6\u03b3\n3\u03b3(2 \u2212 \u03b3)\n, z+ = 1, s+ = +\u03b1\u03bb\n, y+ =\nx+ = +\n2\u03bb\u03b1\n2\u03b12 \u03bb2\nr\n\u221a\n6\u03b3\n3\u03b3(2 \u2212 \u03b3)\nx\u2212 = \u2212\n, z\u2212 = 1, s\u2212 = \u2212\u03b1\u03bb\n, y\u2212 =\n2\u03bb\u03b1\n2\u03b12 \u03bb2\nThis behavior is clearly shown in fig. 1. It is seen, in\nparticular, that the trajectories in phase space emerge\nfrom the point S = (x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0) \u2013 the empty\nMisner-RS universe \u2013 meaning that this is the past attractor of the Randall-Sundrum cosmological model. We\nwant to notice that the points with z = 0 have been removed from the phase space \u03a8 since, in general, at z = 0\nthe autonomous system of equations (5-7,10) blows up\ndue to our choice of phase space variables. For that reason the point S does not appear in table II. See [15] for\nfurther discussion.\nFIG. 1: Trajectories in phase space (x, y, z) for different sets\ninitial conditions for the potential V = V0 [sinh(\u03bb\u03c6)]\u2212\u03b1 . The\nfree parameters have been chosen to be (\u03b1, \u03b3, \u03bb): (3, 1, 0.5) upper panel, (3, 1, 0.65) - central panel, and (3, 1, 5) - lower\npanel. For the first parameter selection the late-time attractor\nis the scalar field-dominated solution (point P6 in table II).\nFor the remaining parameter selections the late-time attractor\nis the matter-scaling solution (point P7 in table II). In the\nlast case this point is a stable spiral.\n\n2.\n\nV = V0 [cosh(\u03bb\u03c6) \u2212 1]\u03b1\n\nThis potential was proposed in [25] in order to describe\nboth quintessence and a new form of dark matter called\nfrustrated cold dark matter, due to its ability to frustrate\ngravitational clustering at small scales.

Therefore P6 and P7 are both saddle points. The critical point\nP3 is the late-time attractor (see fig. 2).\n\nThe Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati braneworld\n\nWe study here the stability of the critical points of the\nautonomous system (16-19). As before, we will rely here\non the assumption that the function f (s) has zero(s) at\ngiven value(s) s\u2217 : f (s\u2217 ) = 0.\nThe critical points of the system (16-19) are shown\nin table IV, while the eigenvalues of the corresponding\nJacobian matrices are shown in the table V. We have not\nincluded the points with z = \u22121 in our analysis, since the\nequations (16-19) are invariant under the change of sign\nz \u2192 \u2212z.\nThe critical points P1 , P2\u00b1 , P3 are associated with the\nstationary points of the potential \u2013 extrema and saddle\nstationary points \u2013 and, in general, with potentials whose\n\u03c6-derivative vanishes (including the constant potential).\nThe existence of the remaining critical points depends, in\ngeneral, on the concrete functional form of the potentials,\nsince, as stated before, the value s\u2217 is determined by the\nform of f (s).\nThe points P1 , P2\u00b1 , P3 , P4 are non-hyperbolic critical\npoints (one of the eigenvalues of the corresponding Jacobian matrixes vanishes).

It can\nbe, at most, a saddle.\n\u2022 For s2\u2217 < 3\u03b3 (s\u2217 df > 0), the scalar field-dominated\nsolution (point P6 ) is the future atractor. Otherwise, P6 is a saddle point. As seen from table II\nthis critical point can be associated with accelerated expansion whenever s2\u2217 < 2\u03b3 (s\u2217 df > 0).\n\u2022 For values s2\u2217 > 3\u03b3 the matter-scaling solution\n(point P7 ) is a the late-time attractor. For 3\u03b3 <\ns2\u2217 < 6 it is a stable node, while, for s2\u2217 > 6 it is a\nstable spiral. This solution is always a decelerating\none.\n\u2022 The kinetic energy-dominated/stiff fluid solution\n(point P5\u00b1 ) is always a saddle critical point in the\nphase space.\nThe non-hyperbolic critical point P2 (in fact, a set of\ncritical points), represents the slow-roll Friedmann equation relating the Hubble expansion parameter with the\npotential of the inflaton field, modified by the presence\nof the RS brane (see equation (23)).\n\n(p < 1/2), the scalar field dominates the mass density in the\nuniverse at late times, leading to accelerated expansion. This\npotential might serve as a good candidate for quintessence. The\nmatter-scaling is approximately constant during the prolonged\nepoch.\n\nFIG. 5: Trajectories in phase space (x, y, z) for different\nsets of initial conditions for the Minkowski phase of the\nDGP model \u03a8+ . The upper panel is for the potential V =\nV0 [sinh(\u03bb\u03c6)]\u2212\u03b1 , the panel at the center is for the potential\nV = V0 exp(\u03bb\u03c62 )/\u03c6\u03b1 , while the panel at the bottom is for the\npotential V = V0 [cosh(\u03bb\u03c6) \u2212 1]p .\n\nIn general, the dynamical behavior of the RandallSundrum model differs from the standard behavior\nwithin four-dimensional Einstein-Hilbert gravity coupled\n\n\f11\nto a self-interacting scalar field, only at early times (high\nenergy regime). Actually, the empty (Misner-RS) universe is always the past attractor in the phase space of the\nRandall-Sundrum cosmological model [15]. This result is\nto be contrasted with the standard four-dimensional result where the kinetic energy-dominated solution is the\npast attractor [23, 26]. Within the present scenario the\nlatter solution (critical points P4 and P5\u00b1 in tables II and\nIII) is always a saddle point.\nThe late-time cosmological dynamics, on the contrary,\nis not affected by the RS brane effects in any essential\nway.\n\nstability of the corresponding (late-time) critical points.\nActually, in the present case the matter-scaling solution\n(critical point P7 ), as well as the scalar field-dominated\nphase, are always saddle critical points. This result has to\nbe confronted with the classical general relativity result\nwhere the above mentioned solutions can be a late-time\nattractors.\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nApart from the exponential potential, there are a large\nnumber of potentials that can produce the matter-scaling\nsolution (critical point P7 ). This result is expected since,\nin the 4-dimensional limit, when standard Friedmann behavior is recovered, we are left with the case studied in\nthe reference [23], where the matter-scaling solution was\nidentified as a critical point in phase space.\nNevertheless, the DGP brane effects indeed modify the\nlate-time cosmological dynamics through changing the\n\nIn the present paper a thorough study of the phase\nspace of both, the Randall-Sundrum and the DvaliGabadadze-Porrati braneworlds \u2013 with a self-interacting\nscalar field trapped on the brane \u2013, has been undertaken.\nA wide class of self-interaction potentials for which the\nquantity \u0393 \u2261 V \u2202\u03c62 V /(\u2202\u03c6 V )2 can be written as a function\nof the variable s \u2261 \u2212\u2202\u03c6 V /V , are included in this study.\nIt has been demonstrated, in particular, that the\nempty Misner-RS universe is always the past attractor\nin the phase space of the Randall-Sundrum cosmological model. The RS brane effects modify the earlytime dynamics, so that, additionally, the kinetic energydominated solution \u2013 the past attractor within general relativity plus a slef-interacting (minimally-coupled)\nscalar field \u2013 is always a saddle critical point. The critical\npoints that can be associated with late-time behaviour,\nas well as their stability properties, are not modified by\nthe RS brane effects.\nA detailed study of the dynamics of the DGP brane\n(with a self-interacting scalar field trapped on it), reveals that the critical points in phase space, coincide\nwith the ones found in standard (four-dimensional) general relativity. An additional critical point that can be\nassociated with five-dimensional behaviour, can be found\nonly for the constant self-interaction potential. Nevertheless, even if, in general, there are no critical points that\ncould be associated with genuine higher-dimensional effects, DGP brane effects indeed play a role: they modify\nthe stability properties of the critical points associated\nwith late-time cosmological dynamics.\nThe above results have been clearly illustrated with\nthe help of phase space pictures generated by several potentials of cosmological interest.\nThis work was partially supported by CONACyT\nM\u00e9xico, under grants 49865-F and by grant number\nI0101/131/07 C-234/07, Instituto Avanzado de Cosmologia (IAC) collaboration.
