In a flat universe\nthe detection of the ISW effect provides direct and independent evidence for dark energy.\nMoreover, we use our detection to constrain the dark energy density \u03a9\u039b . We obtain estimates\nfor \u03a9\u039b consistent with other analysis techniques and data sets and rule out a zero cosmological\nconstant at greater than 99% significance.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nStrong observational evidence now exists in support of the \u039b cold dark matter (\u039bCDM) fiducial\nmodel of the universe. Much of this evidence comes from recent measurements of the cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB) anisotropies, in particular the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy\nProbe (WMAP) data2 . At this point, the confirmation of the fiducial \u039bCDM model and the\nexistence of dark energy by independent physical methods is of particular interest. One such\napproach is through the detection of the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect9 .\nIt is not feasible to separate directly the contribution of the ISW effect from the CMB\nanisotropies. Instead, as first proposed by Crittenden & Turok5 , the ISW effect may be detected\nby cross-correlating the CMB anisotropies with tracers of the local matter distribution (for\nredshift in the range 0 \u2264 z \u2264 2). A cross-correlation indicative of the ISW effect was detected\nfirst by Boughn & Crittenden3 and since by many other authors. In these proceedings we give\na very brief overview of our recent work6 using directional spherical wavelets to detect the ISW\neffect and contrain dark energy parameters.\n\n\f(a) SMHW\n\n(a) SMHW\n\n(b) SBW\n(b) SBW\n\nFigure 1: Spherical wavelets at scale a = b = 0.2.\n\nFigure 2: Wavelet covariance N\u03c3 surfaces with\ntwo and three N\u03c3 contours shown.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nAnalysis procedure\nContinuous spherical wavelet transform\n\nWavelets are an ideal tool to search for the ISW effect11,6 due to the scale and spatial localisation\nprovided by a wavelet analysis. To perform an analysis of full-sky CMB maps, Euclidean wavelets\nmust be extended to spherical geometry. We apply our fast CSWT algorithm7,8 , which is\nbased on the spherical wavelet transform developed by Antoine, Vandergheynst and colleagues\n1,13 and the fast spherical convolution developed by Wandelt & G\u00f3rski12 . We consider two\nspherical wavelets in our subsequent analysis: the spherical Mexican hat wavelet (SMHW) and\nthe spherical butterfly wavelet (SBW). These spherical wavelets are illustrated in Fig. 1.\n2.2\n\nWavelet covariance estimator\n\nThe covariance of the wavelet coefficients is used as an estimator to detect any cross-correlation\nbetween the CMB and the local matter distribution. The wavelet coefficient covariance estimator\nis denoted X\u0302\u03c8NT (a, b), where (a, b) define the size of the anisotropic dilation (note that perfect\nreconstruction is not possible in the case of anisotropic dilations7 ). For a given cosmological\nmodel, the theoretical wavelet covariance is given by6\nX\u03c8NT (a, b, \u03b3)\n\n=\n\n\u221e\nX\nl=0\n\nT\np l 2 bN\nl bl\n\nClNT\n\nl\nX\nm=\u2212l\n\n|(\u03c8a,b )lm |2 ,\n\n(1)\n\n\fwhere \u03c8lm are the spherical harmonic coefficients of the wavelet, ClNT is the cross-power spectrum\nfor the model considered and bl and pl are beam and pixel window functions respectively.\n2.3\n\nData and simulations\n\nThe detection of the ISW effect is cosmic variance limited, hence we require (near) full sky maps\nin our analysis. We consider the WMAP co-added map and the NVSS radio source catalogue4 .\nThe near full-sky coverage and source distribution of the NVSS data make it a suitable probe\nof the local matter distribution to use. To quantify the significance of any correlations between\nthe data we simulate 1000 Gaussian co-added maps, constructed by mimicking the WMAP\nobserving strategy and co-added map construction technique.\n2.4\n\nProcedure\n\nThe analysis consists of computing the wavelet covariance estimator described in section 2.2\nfor a range of scales and orientations. We consider only those scales where the ISW signal is\nexpected to be significant, ranging over dilation scales from 100\u2032 \u2013500\u2032 , in steps of 50\u2032 , and consider\nfive evenly spaced orientations in the domain [0, \u03c0). Any deviation from zero in the wavelet\ncovariance estimator for any particular scale or orientation is an indication of a correlation\nbetween the WMAP and NVSS data and hence a possible detection of the ISW effect. An\nidentical analysis is performed using the simulated co-added CMB maps in order to construct\nsignificance measures for any detections made. Finally, we use any detections of the ISW effect\nto constrain dark energy parameters.\n3\n3.1\n\nResults and discussion\nDetection of the ISW effect\n\nA positive wavelet covariance outside of the 99% significance level is detected on a number\nof scales and orientations. On examining the distribution of the wavelet covariance statistics\nfrom the simulations, the covariance statistics appear to be approximately Gaussian distributed.\nThis implies that the approximate significance of any detections of a non-zero covariance can be\ninferred directly from the N\u03c3 level. In Fig. 2 we plot the N\u03c3 surfaces for each wavelet in (a, b)\nspace. The maximum detection made for each wavelet occurs at N\u03c3 = 3.9 on wavelet scales\nabout (a, b) = (100\u2032 , 300\u2032 ). The wavelet analysis allows us to localise on the sky those regions\nthat contribute most strongly to the covariance detected. These localised regions are evenly\ndistributed over the entire sky and do not appear to be the sole source of the correlation between\nthe data.6 In addition, we test whether foregrounds or WMAP systematics are responsible for\nthe correlation but find no evidence to support this.6 The correlation we detect therefore appears\nto be consistent with a signal due to the ISW effect.\n3.2\n\nConstraints on dark energy\n\nWe use our detection of the ISW effect to constrain dark energy parameters by comparing\nthe theoretically predicted wavelet covariance signal for different cosmological models with that\nmeasured from the data. In particular, we constrain \u03a9\u039b over the range 0 < \u03a9\u039b < 0.95, assuming\na pure cosmological constant (we allow the equation-of-state parameter w to vary in our previous work6 ). For other cosmological parameters we assume concordance model values10 . The\nlikelihood distributions computed using each wavelet are shown in Fig. 3. Within error bounds\nthe parameter estimates obtained from the mean of the distributions are consistent with each\nother and with estimates made using other techniques and data sets.

For both wavelets, we have very strong evidence for the\nexistence of dark energy.\n4\n\nConclusions\n\nUsing directional spherical wavelets we have made a detection of the ISW effect at the 3.9\u03c3 level.\nIn a flat universe the ISW effect exists only in the presence of dark energy, hence our detection\nmay be interpreted as independent evidence for dark energy. We rule out a model with no dark\nenergy (\u03a9\u039b = 0) at > 99% significance.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Jacques Delabrouille and Daniel Mortlock for insightful discussions and comments.\nSee McEwen et al. 20066 for additional acknowledgements.\nReferences\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n\nAntoine J. -P. and Vandergheynst P., 1998, J. of Math.
