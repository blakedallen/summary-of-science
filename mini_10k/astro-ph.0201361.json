Some cases\nshowing interaction between pairs of satellites are presented and briefly discussed.\nSubject headings: galaxies: general-galaxies \u2013 structure-galaxies \u2013 fundamental parameters\n\n1.\n\n& Herndquist (1996); Aguerri, Balcells, & Peletier\n2001). This accretion of satellites can also trigger\nstarbursts (Mihos & Hernquist 1994), and produce counterrotating disks (e.g., Thakar & Ryden 1996). However, there is some controversy\nover whether or not the observed structure in disk\ngalaxies is compatible with the number of such\nmergers expected in the standard model (Toth &\nOstriker (1992); Zaritsky (1995); Weinberg (1997);\nVelazquez & White 1999).\nThe Milky Way and M31 are examples of\nbright spiral galaxies surrounded by several satellites. Semi-analytic models (Kauffmann, White, &\nGuideroni 1993) and numerical simulation (Klypin\net al. (1999); Moore et al. 1999) of hierarchical\nclustering galaxy formation predict a number of\nsatellites an order of magnitude larger than observed in the Local Group. Several alternatives\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe standard model for the formation of large\nstructures in the Universe predicts a hierarchical scenario in which the first generation of objects created correspond to subgalactic masses\n(Frenk et al. 1988). The aggregation of such objects by accretion, merging, etc., over cosmological timescales would generate the wide variety of\nstructures observed in the Universe. Mergers between two objects of similar masses destroy disks\n(Barnes & Hernquist 1991) and seem to be one of\nthe mechanisms that create ellipticals from spiral galaxies. A merger between a giant galaxy\nand a small satellite tends to heat and thicken\nthe disk (Vel\u00e1zquez & White 1999) and could contribute to the growth of the bulge and an increase\nin the S\u00e9rsic n parameter (S\u00e9rsic 1968) moving\nthe galaxy toward earlier types (Walker, Mihos,\n1\n\n\fhave been proposed to solve this discrepancy. It\nhas been suggested (Klypin et al. (1999), Blitz\net al. 1999) that these missing satellites were in\nthe form of the compact high velocity clouds identified by Braun & Burton (1999). Bode et al.\n(2001) have analyzed a warm dark matter model\nin which the dark matter particles have non-zero\nvelocities; these tend to suppress the structures\non small scales. In this model small halos should\nbe formed by fragmentation instead of by aggregation. Using numerical simulations, Bode et al.\nshow a reasonable agreement between the predictions of their model and observations on the\nnumber of satellites, the spatial distribution, and\nthe epoch of formation. A possible reionization\nof the Universe at high redshift could also suppress the formation of small galaxies after that\nepoch (Bullock, Kravtsov, & Weinberg (2000);\nSomerville (2001); Benson et al. 2001).\nThe existence of satellite galaxies in external\nsystems has been known for a long time (e. g. Page\n(1952), Holmberg 1969). The most complete compilation and study of such objects was conducted\nby Zaritsky et al. (1997) who presented a catalogue containing 115 satellites orbiting 69 primary\nisolated spiral galaxies. Zaritsky et al. defined\nsatellites as objects at projected distances \u2264 500\nkpc from their primaries, with differences in recessional velocity \u2264 500 km s\u22121 and at least 2.2 mag\nfainter than their parent galaxy. The number of\ncatalogued satellites per system is very small (typically 1\u20132) and for construction of the catalogue\nthey should correspond to the brightest part of the\nluminosity function of these objects (see Pritchet\n& van den Bergh 1999). Although the completeness of this catalogue is hardly understood (see\nZaritsky et al. 1993), it can be estimated to absolute limiting magnitude MB \u223c \u221215.5. Zaritsky et\nal., have used the catalogue to demonstrate that\nthe halos of the primaries extend to at least 200\nkpc and have masses larger than 2 \u00d7 1012 M\u2299 .\nOther observational studies have been conducted\nby Carignan et al. (1997), who have discovered\nand analyzed eight dwarf galaxies orbiting the\nmassive lenticular galaxy NGC 5084. This group\nshows a nice example of one of the predictions\nof the standard models: i.e., there should be a\nnet excess of satellites in retrograde orbits because, as the numerical simulations show (Quinn\n& Goodman 1986), it is more effective for the par-\n\nent galaxy to accrete the satellites in direct orbits.\nCote et al. (1997) have discovered 16 and 20 dwarf\ngalaxies in the Sculptor and the Centaurus group\nrespectively. Some controversy exist about the reality of the so-called \"Holmberg effect\", i.e., the\nfact that satellites tend to avoid the plane of the\nprimary; while Zaritsky et al., claimed the existence of the effect in their sample, Carignan et al.,\nhave not found it in their study of the NGC 5084\ngroup.\nIn the study of these external satellites it is interesting to compare their properties with those\nobserved in the Local Group; this will help us to\nunderstand the theoretical models for the formation of structures in galactic halos. We are conducting an ongoing observational program which\ncomprises broad band photometry in the optical\n(B, V , R, and I) and infrared (J and K \u2032 ), and\nin the H\u03b1 narrow band for both the parent and\nthe satellite galaxies, taken from the compilation\nby Zaritsky et al. (1997). The aim of this study\nis to determine the structure, dynamics, star formation rates, and stellar populations to constrain\nthe age and metallicity of such systems. Here, we\nconcentrate on the morphology and structural parameters of the satellite galaxies.\n2.\n\nTHE SAMPLE, OBSERVATIONS, AND\nDATA REDUCTION\n\nThe observations presented here correspond to\na subsample of 60 satellites taken from the compilation by Zaritsky et al. (1997). This sample comprises most of the objects situated at dec\n\u2265 \u221222 degrees. During several runs between 1997\nand 2001 we used the 0.8 m IAC801 and the 1 m\nOGS1 telescopes, the 2.5 m Isaac Newton Telescope (INT) and the 4.2 William Herschel Telescope (WHT) at the Roque de Los Muchachos\nObservatory2, and the 2.2 m and 3.5 m telescopes\nat Calar Alto 3 . Typical exposures times were\n\u223c 30\u201390 minutes, and \u223c 5\u201310 minutes for the 1\n1 The\n\ntelescopes are at the Spanish Teide Observatory on\nthe island of Tenerife and are operated by the Instituto de\nAstrof\u0131\u0301sica de Canarias\n2 These telescopes are operated on the island of La Palma\nby the Isaac Newton Group\n3 The German-Spanish Astronomical Centre, Calar Alto is\noperated by the Max-Planck-Institute for Astronomy, Heidelberg, jointly with the Spanish National Commission for\nAstronomy.\n\n2\n\n\fm class and for larger telescopes respectively. In\nthe analysis presented here, we use the R filter\nin most of the cases, although in a few cases we\nused the I or the V filter (see below). The typical magnitude limit was R \u223c 24 mag/arcsec2.\nThe pixel size is different according to the telescope and instrument used but was typically in\nthe range 0.3\u20130.5 arcsec. The seeing was between\n1 and 3 arcsec with a typical value of 2 arcsec. We\nperformed standard data reduction: (bias subtraction, flat fielding correction, co-addition of images,\nsky subtraction, and cleaning of the remaining cosmic rays).\n3.\n\nin which bulges dominated, the gradients in luminosity usually being higher and more dramatic for\nS\u00e9rsic profiles with high n parameter. In order to\neliminate or greatly reduce the effect, we have excluded from the fits the central few arcsec of the\nprofile. The exact size of the region excluded depends on the size and profile of each galaxy. We\nhave tested our procedure by changing the region\nexcluded from the fit, in several cases making a\ncomparison between the parameters derived with\nour fits and those obtained with the full treatment\nof the seeing (Trujillo et al. 2001), and found that\nour approach is correct.\nFigure 1 shows grayscales image, contour plots,\nsurface brightness profiles, and the fits of the satellite galaxies analyzed in this paper. North is up\nand east is to the left. The field of view depends\non each case and is indicated in the contour plots.\nIn the fits with both a spheroid and a disk, each\ncomponent is also shown in the plots.\nTable 1 presents the structural and morphological types of the objects. The columns are 1: the\nname of the object; 2: MB the absolute magnitude\nin the B band taken from Zaritsky et al. (1997);\n3: D the projected distance in kpc between the\nsatellite and the parent galaxy; 4: the filter used:\n5-6: re the radius of the bulge in arcsec and kpc\nrespectively (we have adopted h0 = 0.75); 7: the n\nparameter of the bulge; 8-9: rd the length scale of\nthe disk in arcsec and kpc respectively; 10: B/T\nthe bulge to total luminosity ratio computed from\nthe structural parameters in columns 5-9, and 11:\nthe morphological Hubble type.\nFor the great majority of the objects it was possible to determine their morphological type. The\nsymbols * and ** quoted in some of the cases of Table 1 mean uncertain classification and signs of distortion/interaction respectively. We wish to make\nthe following remarks on some of the individual\nobjects:\n\nMORPHOLOGY AND STRUCTURAL\nPARAMETERS\n\nThe morphological type of the objects was determined by visual inspection, and this was our\nfirst criterion for classification. Using the ELLIPSE task in IRAF4 we fitted ellipses to their\nisophotes and determined from these the surface\nbrightness profile. For the bulge we used a S\u00e9rsic\nlaw:\nI(r) = Ie 10\u2212bn [(r/re )\n\n(1/n)\n\n\u22121]\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere r is the radial coordinate and bn = 0.868n\u2212\n0.142 is defined so that re is the radius enclosing half of the light of this component (Capaccioli\n1989). The de Vaucouleurs profile corresponds to\nthe particular case n = 4. For the disk component\nwe used an exponential law:\nI(r) = I0 e(\u2212r/rd ) .\n\n(2)\n\nIn total there are five free parameters to be determined, Ie , n, and re for the spheroid and I0 and\nrd for the disk respectively. However, we do not\nhave photometric calibration for our images and so\nwe could not determine the absolute brightness of\neach component (characterized by the parameters\nIe and I0 ).\nThe sizes of most of the galaxies analyzed in\nthis paper are considerably larger than the seeing (see below). Furthermore, the effect of seeing\nis relevant only in the central parts of the galaxy\n\n\u2022 NGC 488c and NGC 2424b are examples of a\nlow surface brightness galaxies without any\nstructure. Other galaxies in the sample such\nas NGC 4030c also have low surface brightness, but in this case there are knots.\n\u2022 There are a few cases of spiral edge-on galaxies in which we were not able to determine\nthe Hubble type and no satisfactory fit was\n\n4 IRAF\n\nis the Image Reduction and Analysis Facility, written and supported by the IRAF programming group at\nthe National Optical Astronomy Observatories (NOAO) in\nTucson, Arizona.\n\n3\n\n\ffound. In these cases we have classified them\nas S.\n\nrespect to the parent galaxy. Considering the possible bias, completeness, and sampling of our data\nset, we will also conduct a detailed comparison\nbetween the properties found in our systems and\nthose in the Local Group.\n\n\u2022 Many galaxies (\u223c 25 %) show signs of distortion, and at least in two cases interactions\n(see below).\n\nWe would like to thank to A. Mora, S. Palomares, J. C. Suarez, C. Hoyos, and M. S. Alonso\nthat collaborated with the observations under a\nsummer grant at the IAC.\n\n\u2022 NGC 488b and NGC 2775b are examples of\nspiral galaxies with very distorted disks. In\nthe case of NGC 488b only the bulge was\nfitted.\n4.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe results presented here show that satellite\ngalaxies present a wide variety of morphological\ntypes, sizes, and brightness. The Hubble types\ngo from pure ellipticals to irregulars. About 35\nobjects have been classified as spiral galaxies.\nThe largest group in the catalogue is NGC 1961\nand its five satellites. All these satellites are luminous (\u221219.6 \u2264 MB \u2264 \u221218.1) spiral galaxies. This\ngroup is notably different from the Local Group\nin which only M33 and LMC have magnitude in\nthis range. The other large groups in the sample\nare those formed by NGC 4030 and NGC 4541,\nwhich have four detected satellites each. This last\nis a notable group in which two of the galaxies\nshow clear interaction (see below), and another,\nNGC 4541d, shows strong asymmetries. There\nare two clear cases of interaction between pairs of\nsatellites: NGC 2718a and NGC 2718b, and NGC\n4541b and NGC 4541e, respectively. This is illustrated in Figure 2. In the first case the interaction\nshows up in the form of a bridge connecting both\ngalaxies. In the case of the second interacting pair,\ntwo tidal tails seem to emerge from NGC 4541b.\nOne of them points directly to NGC 4541e and it\nseems clear that its origin is the interaction with\nthis galaxy; the other is nearly in the opposite\ndirection and could reveal stripping from a previous orbit. The asymmetries shown by NGC 4541e\ncould be also related with this interaction. Another notable case is NGC 4030c classified as Irr,\nin which several extended objects are surrounded\nby a common diffuse structure resembling a case\nof strong interaction or merger.\nIn a forthcoming paper, we will analyze the relationship between the different structural parameters, and between these parameters and the relative position and orientation of the satellites with\n4\n\n\fPritchet, C.
