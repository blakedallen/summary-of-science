Introduction\nThe intracluster gas, i.e. hot gas in clusters of galaxies,\nwhich undergoes radiative cooling is thought to flow in\ntoward the cluster center to maintain pressure equilibrium (see Fabian 1994 for a review and references therein).\nAccording to the standard cooling flow picture, the mass\ndeposition rate \u1e40 can be estimated from the differential luminosity. X-ray observations showed that \u1e40 inferred\nfrom the surface brightness profile was over 100 M\u2299 yr\u22121\nfor so called cooling flow clusters. However, firm evidence\nhas not been found for such a large amount of cooled gas\nthat should be detected at longer wavelengths if it existed\nin the cluster core (e.g., Edge 2001).\nASCA and recent Chandra and XMM-Newton observations (e.g., David et al. 2001; Kaastra et al. 2001; Allen\net al. 2001; Peterson et al. 2003) with better spatial and\nspectral resolution reveal, however, that \u1e40 is smaller by\nan order of magnitude than what was estimated before\nfrom the surface brightness. Moreover, spectroscopic analysis shows that the gas temperature decreases toward the\ncluster center, as expected for cooling flows, but down to\nonly half or one-third the temperature of the non-cooling\nambient gas. This implies the lack of soft X-ray emission,\nor no appreciable contribution of lower temperature gas.\nSend offprint requests to: K. Masai\n\nTo explain the observations, various theoretical models have been proposed (see e.g., B\u00f6hringer et al. 2002;\nPeterson et al. 2003). Many of those consider the central active galaxy (with an active galactic nucleus (AGN))\nas a heating source to compensate radiation loss (e.g.,\nChurazov et al. 2001; Ruszkowski & Begelman 2002;\nKaiser & Binney 2003). This idea is interesting from the\naspect of history of activity (Reynolds, Heinz & Begelman\n2002), since many cooling flow clusters possess cD galaxies in their central regions. However, some fine tuning is\nrequired. While the radiative cooling rate is determined\nby the local values of temperature and density, the conductive or convective heating rate including hot bubbles\nfrom AGN depends on the scale length of the temperature\nor pressure as well. This could make the processes complicated, and the parameters such as diffusion coefficient or\nmixing length remain open (Narayan & Medvedev 2001;\nVoigt et al. 2002).\nIn a standard analysis of X-ray data, an isobaric cooling flow model is applied to estimate \u1e40 (Fabian 1994).\nHowever, analysis based on surface brightness and analysis\nbased on spectrum give inconsistent results, as mentioned\nabove, in spite of both being based on the same physical concept. This may suggest some problem underlying\nthe standard cooling flow model. In the standard isobaric\nmodel, work done by gravity on the inflow gas is not properly taken into account. This is not an additional heating\n\n\f2\n\nK. Masai and T. Kitayama: Quasi-hydrostatic intracluster gas under radiative cooling\n\nsource but is naturally expected for the gas under gravity.\nIf the inflow is induced and regulated smoothly by local radiative cooling under gravity, quasi-hydrostatic structure\nmay be attained. Such a simple picture is thought to be a\nstarting point for considering an alternative heat source.\nIn the present paper we examine quasi-hydrostatic intracluster gas undergoing radiative cooling, taking proper\naccount of the work done by gravity. In Sect. 2 we present\nour quasi-hydrostatic cooling model. We compare our\nmodel with the standard isobaric cooling flow model in\nSect. 3, and give concluding remarks in Sect. 4.\n\n2. Quasi-hydrostatic cooling model\nThe internal energy U of the gas changes as\ndU = CV dT = d\u2032 Q \u2212 P d\n\n1\n\u03c1\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\nEq. (1) is rewritten for the quasi-hydrostatic intracluster\ngas, as\n5 M\nGMr\u2217\nM dr.\nk\ndT = \u2212Ldt \u2212\n2 \u03bcm\nr2\n\n(3)\n\nHere M (r) is a gas mass undergoing radiation loss at\na rate L(r); one can consider, for instance, a shell as\nM (r) = 4\u03c0r2 \u03c1\u2206r. Mr\u2217 is the gravitational mass contained\nin the radius concerned, \u03bc the mean molecular weight, m\nthe proton mass, and other quantities have their usual\nmeanings. The term 'quasi-hydrostatic' does not mean\nstatic but is used for the steady state under gravity.\nFrom Eq. (3) and the continuity equation,\n\u1e40r = \u22124\u03c0r2 \u03c1\n\ndr\n,\ndt\n\nwe obtain\n\u0013\n\u0012\nL\nGMr\u2217\n5 k dT\n= 4\u03c0r2 \u03c1\n+\n= 4\u03c0r2 n2 \u039b,\n\u1e40r\n2 \u03bcm dr\nr2\nM\n\n3\n3 kT0\nGMr\u2217\n\u2243 \u03c3r2 = \u03b2\n,\nr\n2\n2 \u03bcm\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u03c3r is the line-of-sight velocity dispersion of the\ngalaxies in the cluster; \u03b2 is a parameter in the so-called\n\u03b2-model of intracluster gas. We consider that Mr\u2217 is large\nenough compared to the gas mass Mr within r and that\nthe gas inflow hardly alters the gravitational potential.\nEq. (5) with T0 is expressed in the form\n\u0014\n\u0015\n9 4\u03c0 3 n2 \u039b \u03bcm 1 T0\nd ln T\n\u2212 \u03b2\n=\nr\nd ln r\n5 3 (3/2)kT \u1e40r\n3 T\n\"\n#\n9 M\u0303r /t\u0303cool 1 T0\n=\n\u2212 \u03b2\n,\n(7)\n5\n3 T\n\u1e40r\nwhere, in the last expression,\n\nwhere CV is the specific heat at constant volume, and T ,\n\u03c1 and P are the gas temperature, density and pressure,\nrespectively. The first and second terms on the right-hand\nside represent heat flowing into and work done on the gas,\nrespectively. If the gas is flowing toward the cluster center,\nwork by gravitational force would be done on the gas.\nWe consider a spherically symmetric structure. By using the EOS (equation of state) of an ideal gas and the\nhydrostatic balance equation\nGM \u2217\n1\ndP = \u2212 2 r dr,\n\u03c1\nr\n\nas the gas, can be replaced with the equilibrium (virial)\ntemperature T0 , as\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\nwhere n = \u03c1/\u03bcm is the number density and n2 \u039b the cooling rate per unit volume. \u1e40r represents the gas mass flowing from the outer part into r per unit time.\nWe assume that the intracluster gas is isothermal before cooling when virialized, i.e., (3/2)(kT /\u03bcm) \u223c \u2212\u03c6\nfor the gravitational potential \u03c6 in the cluster (see e.g.,\nSarazin 1986). In such a case, the gravitational mass Mr\u2217 ,\nwhich includes the galaxies and the dark matter as well\n\nM\u0303r \u2261\n\n4\u03c0 3\nr \u03c1\n3\n\nand t\u0303cool \u2261\n\n(3/2)nkT\n.\nn2 \u039b\n\n(8)\n\nHereafter the quantities with tildes represent those evaluated with the local values of density and temperature; M\u0303r\nand t\u0303cool are the mass of a uniform gas sphere and the cooling time, which are given by \u03c1(r) and T (r). Accordingly,\nM\u0303r represents the gas mass within r that cools radiatively\nin the cooling time t\u0303cool given at r. Eq. (5) or (7) shows the\nrelation between variations dT and dr to satisfy Eq. (1) for\nthe relation between \u1e40r and L under quasi-hydrostatic\nbalance, i.e., hydrostatic balance (Eq. (2)) with a mass\nflow (Eq. (4)).\nWe consider that the gas inflow across r is caused by\nradiative cooling within r under quasi-hydrostatic balance\nat every r. While the gas of mass M\u0303r inside loses its pressure on a time scale (\u2202 ln P/\u2202t)\u22121 \u223c (\u2202 ln T /\u2202t)\u22121 = t\u0303cool ,\ngas of temperature T comes into the region at rate \u1e40r to\ncompensate the loss with the time scale t\u0303cool . The inflow\nmass at r during t\u0303cool is expressed approximately as\n\u1e40r t\u0303cool \u223c\n\ndM\u0303r\nt\u0303cool \u223c M\u0303r .\ndt\n\n(9)\n\nTherefore, we assume \u1e40r \u223c M\u0303r /t\u0303cool for a local quasistatic change at a given radius. This condition for observable quantities and its validity are discussed in detail later.\nIt should be noted that M\u0303r differs from the gas mass Mr\ncontained within r, as it depends on the density profile\n\u03c1(r). The cooling time of the gas Mr is also different from\nt\u0303cool . We mention later such global quantities in the discussion of the above condition.\nThe gas that undergoes radiative cooling has a temperature profile given by Eq. (7), while the ambient gas that\nis free from radiative cooling remains isothermal. We define a radius rcool at which t\u0303cool \u223c tH = H0\u22121 , the Hubble\ntime. t\u0303cool < tH at r < rcool , and t\u0303cool > tH at r > rcool ,\nbecause t\u0303cool becomes monotonically shorter toward the\ninner region. At r > rcool \u223c 100 kpc, radiative cooling has\nlittle effect on the hydrostatic structure, and the gas temperature is nearly equal to the gravitational temperature.\n\n\fK. Masai and T. Kitayama: Quasi-hydrostatic intracluster gas under radiative cooling\n\nOn the other hand, at r < rcool the effect of cooling becomes important. The temperature decreases and the gas\nis flowing inward, yet the gas is likely quasi-hydrostatic\nif the inflow is smooth and\n\u221a its speed is much slower than\nthe local sound speed \u221d T , or more correctly, the ram\npressure is small compared to the thermal pressure.\nThus, the temperature of the quasi-hydrostatic cooling\ngas begins to decrease from T0 at rcool , and approaches an\nasymptotic value given by\nT \u223c\n\n\u1e40r\n1\n\u03b2T0\n3\nM\u0303r /t\u0303cool\n\n(10)\n\ntoward the cluster center.

Inversely, if observations\nshow t\u0303cool \u221d r, this implies \u2212\u03b1+\u03b7(1\u2212\u03be) \u223c 1 and therefore\nthe validity of the assumption \u1e40 \u223c M\u0303r /t\u0303cool at every r or\n(M\u0303r /t\u0303cool )/\u1e40 \u223c constant. A recent report on 16 clusters\nobserved by Chandra (Voigt & Fabian 2004) seems to suggest t\u0303cool \u221d r. These properties as well as the temperature\nprofile predicted by the quasi-hydrostatic cooling model\nwith \u1e40r \u223c M\u0303r /t\u0303cool can be confirmed by observations.\nThe gas mass Mr contained within r is larger than M\u0303r for\nthe density profile with \u03b1 < 0.

(7) with \u1e40r \u223c M\u0303r /t\u0303cool at every r. For\n\u1e40r = \u03b2 \u22121 M\u0303r /t\u0303cool , the temperature decreases as T \u221d r6/5\nat T \u223c T0 , as T \u221d r3/5 at T \u223c (1/2)T0 , and eventually\nbecomes \u223c (1/3)T0 . In practice, at the cluster center, the\ngas accumulates and cools further to a lower temperature.\nIt is likely that at T <\n\u223c T0 (r <\n\u223c rcool ) the temperature is\nsomewhat less steep than T \u221d r6/5 and becomes flatter\noutward so that the temperature connects smoothly with\nT \u223c T0 at r \u223c rcool . If electron conduction works, the\ntemperature would vary more gradually at 0.5 <\n\u223c r/rcool <\n\u223c\n1.\nWe examine the density profile of the gas in quasihydrostatic cooling considered here. For simplicity, we express the density and temperature profiles as \u03c1 \u221d r\u03b1 and\nT \u221d r\u03b7 , where \u03b7 is given by Eq. (7). Since\n\nthe difference between Mr /tcool and M\u0303r /t\u0303cool is estimated\nto be within a factor of \u223c 2.\nWhile the gas is cooling, \u1e40r is coming in from the\nouter part so as to maintain the quasi-hydrostatic balance.\nSuch a flow is not very drastic, since the gas is cooling\nmonotonically and thereby the inflow is smooth.

Masai and T. Kitayama: Quasi-hydrostatic intracluster gas under radiative cooling\n\nwhere \u03bc = 0.61 is assumed.\nFor the values of typical cooling flow clusters, the mass\nflow rate may be \u223c 100M\u2299 yr\u22121 . The local inflow rate \u1e40r\ndoes not mean the mass deposition rate (see Sect. 3) but\nmerely gives an upper limit on the cooled mass in the cluster. Eq. (16) or (17) means that following the change in T\n(Eqs. (3) and (5)) \u1e40r increases with increasing L\u0303r . This is\nreasonable if the mass inflow is induced by radiation loss;\n\u1e40r is not simply proportional to L\u0303r but depends also on\nT . The dependence in Eq. (17) should be compared with\nthat in the standard isobaric cooling flow model, which is\ndiscussed in the following section.\n\n3. Comparison with isobaric cooling flow model\nIn the quasi-hydrostatic model, work done by gravity on\nthe intracluster gas is taken into account. The pressure is\ngiven by Eq. (2), and therefore dP 6= 0 in this model. In\ncomparison with quasi-hydrostatic cooling, we discuss isobaric cooling which is often applied to estimate the mass\nflow rate from X-ray observations.\nFor given mass M , with dP = 0 Eq. (1) gives\n5 M\nk\ndT = d\u2032 Q = \u2212Ldt.\n2 \u03bcm\n\n(19)\n\nThis is nothing but the definition of the specific heat CP =\n(d\u2032 Q/dT )P at constant pressure. Eq. (19) simply expresses\nthat for mass M the temperature decreases with time due\nto radiation loss under dP = 0. The density must increase\nto maintain the pressure equilibrium, and the cooling time\nbecomes shorter as \u221d T 2 /\u039b. Thus, the gas cools and flows\nin increasingly toward the cluster center.\nEq. (19) may be compared with the expression for the\nstandard cooling flow model (Fabian 1994),\n\n5 \u1e40\nk\nT \u223c \u2212L,\n2 \u03bcm\n\n(21)\n\nconsistently with Eq. (19) for given M . Eq. (21) means\n\u1e40 < 0 (cf. \u1e40CF > 0) or that the gas of temperature T\ndecreases at a rate \u221d L. The lost gas must be so cool,\nmuch cooler than T , that it no longer contributes to L at\nall.\nSuppose that the intracluster gas has temperature T\nto emit L. With Md being the cooled mass, it increases at\na rate roughly as \u1e40d \u223c \u2212\u1e40 > 0 in the cluster. So that,\nfor the mass deposition rate \u1e40d , we have a global relation\n5 \u1e40d\nk\nT \u223c L,\n2 \u03bcm\n\n(22)\n\nwhere the left-hand side does not mean the enthalpy of\nthe cooling gas; remember that the gas of Md should be\ntoo cool (\u226a T ) to be responsible for L. Even if \u1e40CF is\nconsidered to be \u1e40d , however, it is unlikely that Eq. (22)\nreduces to Eq. (20) for thermodynamical variation dT . As\nreadily seen, Eq. (22) gives \u1e40d \u221d L/T , while \u1e40CF \u221d\ndL/dT in Eq. (20). Accordingly, the standard cooling flow\nmodel would yield an \u1e40CF that traces d\u039b/dT , which is\ndetermined by atomic processes regardless of the thermal\nproperties of the intracluster gas, as discussed below.\nEq. (20) means that \u1e40CF is proportional directly to\n\u2212dL/dT , because dL is the variation with T in the standard cooling flow model. Considering L \u221d \u03c12 \u039b(M/\u03c1) \u221d\n\u03c1\u039bM with P = const. \u2261 P0 , we can express the luminosity in the form\nL=\n\nM \u039b\nP0 .\n\u03bcm kT\n\nThus, Eq. (20) can be rewritten as\n\n5 \u1e40CF\nk\ndT = dL,\n2 \u03bcm\nwhere dT is defined for a change from T to T \u2212 dT\n(Johnstone et al. 1992; Fabian 1994), i.e. dT > 0 for cooling, and corresponds to the variation \u2212dT in the present\npaper. So that, instead of the above equation, we consider\n5 \u1e40CF\nk\ndT = \u2212dL\n2 \u03bcm\n\nFor the enthalpy of the cooling gas of given T , with\ndP = 0 we may have\n\n(20)\n\nas the standard cooling flow model. With increasing radiation loss (dL > 0), the temperature decreases (dT < 0)\nfor given \u1e40CF (> 0); otherwise, if \u1e40CF < 0 were the\ncase, the temperature would increase for dL > 0.\nAccording to the standard cooling flow model (Fabian\n1994), dL in Eq. (20) is the differential luminosity defined\nas dL = (dL/dT )dT . Therefore, Eq. (20) is not a derivative of Eq. (19). This implies that Eq. (20) comes from\nsome other concept than dP = 0 in Eq. (1). \u1e40CF may be\ninterpreted as the gas mass that is cooling and dropping\nout of the flow per unit time (see Wise & Sarazin 1993)\nor the mass deposition rate (Johnstone et al. 1992).\n\n5 \u1e40CF\ndL\nk\n= \u2212\n2 \u03bcm\ndT\n\u0012\n\u0013\nd ln \u039b\nL\n1\u2212\n=\nT\nd ln T\n\u0012\n\u0013\nd ln \u039b\n5 \u1e40d\n1\u2212\n,\n\u223c k\n2 \u03bcm\nd ln T\n\n(23)\n(24)\n(25)\n\nwhere 1 \u2212 d ln \u039b/d ln T > 0 in the temperature range of interest. With decreasing T , the sign of d ln \u039b/d ln T changes\nto be negative at kT \u223c 2 keV, below which line cooling\ndominates over bremsstrahlung. While \u1e40CF \u223c 0.5\u1e40d at\nkT >\n\u223c 2 keV, \u1e40CF \u223c 1.5\u1e40d at kT <\n\u223c 2 keV, on account of\nthe factor (1 \u2212 d ln \u039b/d ln T ). Consequently, \u1e40CF would\nvary sensitively to local minima/maxima in \u039b(T ).\nEq. (23) has been applied to estimate the mass deposition rate from the soft X-ray luminosity (e.g. Peterson et\nal. 2003). In a limited photon-energy range, the T dependence of \u039b becomes complicated because of the presence of\nlines. Therefore, observations with different energy bands\ncould derive different values of \u1e40CF , or spectral analyses could derive values different from each other. In any\n\n\fK. Masai and T. Kitayama: Quasi-hydrostatic intracluster gas under radiative cooling\n\ncase, \u1e40CF of the standard cooling flow model seems not\nto give a reasonable representation of the mass deposition\nrate due to radiation loss d\u2032 Q = \u2212Ldt. If the luminosity L of a cluster is well accounted for by emission of the\nintracluster gas of nearly isothermal temperature T , Eq.\n(22) would give roughly the isobaric deposition rate of the\ncooled-down mass in the cluster.\n\n4. Discussion and remarks\nIn the quasi-hydrostatic model, we consider the ideal condition that a change is quasi-static. The pressure loss\ndue to radiative cooling is immediately compensated by\ncontinuous, smooth, spherical mass inflow from the outer\npart. Neither turbulence nor overshooting occurs during\nthe process. The inflow is so moderate as not to disturb the\nhydrostatic balance significantly. Thus, if the local inflow\nrate is perfectly controlled by the local cooling rate, the\ngas is quasi-hydrostatic and \u1e40r \u223c M\u0303r /t\u0303cool is attained;\nwe will investigate this point further by means of hydrodynamical calculations elsewhere.\nAs mentioned in Sect. 2, 'quasi-hydrostatic' means not\nstatic but steady-state. Accordingly, although the temperature of the cooling gas approaches a constant value toward the cluster center (Fig. 1), this does not mean that\ngravitational work can cancel out radiative cooling. This\ntemperature profile is no more than a result of the steady\ninflow to maintain the hydrostatic balance. It should be\nnoted that the gravitational potential or Mr\u2217 is assumed\nto be little affected by the gas inflow.\nAt the cluster center (or close to a cD galaxy) where\nthe inflow mass is accumulating, the cooling time can be\ntoo short for the actual flow rate to follow the cooling\nrate of the gas inside, i.e. M\u0303r /t\u0303cool > \u1e40r . Then the quasihydrostatic balance would break, and the gas temperature\ninside decreases below \u223c (1/3)\u03b2T0 , yet the temperature in\nthe steady flow region will continue to follow Eq. (7).\nIn the opposite case, if the cooling rate at a given radius is smaller than the inflow rate as M\u0303r /t\u0303cool < \u1e40r , the\nflow rate \u1e40r would decrease inward and the temperature\napproaches a constant value higher than \u223c (1/3)\u03b2T0 toward the cluster center. This may be the case when cooling\nin the core is not yet very significant or when some heating works against local radiative cooling so that t\u0303cool is\neffectively longer than given by Eq. (8).\nThe gas gains momentum during inflow. In the quasistatic model this is included into Eq. (2), which determines\nthe hydrostatic structure in cooperation with EOS. This is\nvalid as long as the momentum flux is small compared to\nthe thermal pressure. In practice, however, particularly in\nthe region where the temperature approaches a constant\nvalue (see Fig. 1), the inflow gas may partly overshoot\nbecause of a fluctuation about \u1e40r \u223c M\u0303r /t\u0303cool . This may\nlead to instability and result in a break in the spherically symmetric structure. The resultant dense part cools\nmore rapidly, but the gas remains quasi-hydrostatic on the\nwhole if the momentum flux is still small on average.\n\n5\n\nWithin the context of quasi-hydrostatic cooling, the\ngas inflow must be mild at every radius. However, if the\nflow evolved so that the momentum flux would become\nconsiderable, though still subsonic, the quasi-hydrostatic\nbalance would fail unless some force works against the inertia. In such a case, for the gas to be quasi-hydrostatic,\nsome momentum flux not in the form of the thermal pressure by heat may be needed against the inflow.\nObservations by coming missions can examine the radial profiles predicted by the quasi-hydrostatic cooling\nmodel for several quantities, such as local cooling time\nt\u0303cool , mass flow rate \u1e40r or local luminosity L\u0303r , and possibly inflow velocity as well as the density and temperature. The observed temperature profiles can be understood\ninvoking quasi-hydrostatic cooling, though some momentum/heat source may be working additionally. The simple\nquasi-hydrostatic model is expected to give a basis for understanding the thermal properties of the intracluster gas\nunder gravity and for advanced study using hydrodynamics codes.\nAcknowledgements.
