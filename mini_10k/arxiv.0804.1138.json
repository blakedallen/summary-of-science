By employing the exact\nsolution for this system, we found resonant charge and spin Hall conductances at a certain magnetic\nfield, where all the nearest-neighboring Landau levels cross. Near this value of magnetic field, there\nexists a resonant spin polarization, which can also induce resonant charge and spin Hall effects.\nPACS numbers: 72.20.My, 73.63.Hs, 75.47.-m\n\nThe spin Hall effect is the current focus of theoretical and experimental investigations [1-6]. The Rashba\nor Dresselhaus spin-orbit interaction plays a fundamental role in generating this effect [7,8,9]. Under a perpendicular magnetic field, a resonant spin Hall conductance is induced in two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG)\nwith pure Rashba coupling due to the crossing of two\nnearest-neighboring Landau levels while the charge Hall\nconductance is not influenced [10]. However, the resonant phenomenon could be observed only if this degeneracy happens at the Fermi level. Furthermore, it is difficult to fix experimentally the degenerate point on the\nFermi level, which depends on a particular filling factor\nor density of electrons. In semiconductors, the Rashba\nand Dresselhaus spin-orbit interactions usually coexist.\nBecause the Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit interactions have different symmetries, the competition between\nthe Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit couplings and the\nZeeman energy leads to a novel energy spectrum. When\nthe Rashba and Dresselhaus coupling strengths are equal,\nthe energy spectrum has an equal-distant-like structure\nand the energy level splitting for the nth Landau level is\nindependent of the Landau level number n [11]. Meanwhile, all the energy level crossings between the nearest\nneighboring Landau levels occur at a fixed magnetic field.\nThis is very different from the case of the pure Rashba\ncoupling in Ref. [10] or unequal Rashba and Dresselhaus\ncoupling strengths [11], where only a single crossing exists at a certain magnetic field. Therefore, 2DEG with\nequal Rashba and Dresselhaus couplings in a perpendicular magnetic field is more interesting. It is well-known\nthat different energy spectrum leads to different physical\nphenomenon. Here, we investigate spin and charge Hall\neffects in this special system. Not only resonant spin Hall\nconductance is obtained, this resonance behavior also appears in charge Hall conductance and spin polarization.\nBecause a degeneracy always exists at the Fermi level\nand the spin polarization is a detectable quantity, these\nresonant phenomena could be easily observed and may\nhave potential application for spintronics.\nThe Hamiltonian for a single electron with spin- 21 in a\n\nplane under a perpendicular magnetic field is given by\nH=\n\n1\n1\n\u03b1\n\u03a02 \u2212 gs \u03bcB B\u03c3z + (\u03c3y \u03a0x \u2212 \u03c3x \u03a0y )\n2m\u2217\n2\n~\n\u03b2\n+ (\u03c3x \u03a0x \u2212 \u03c3y \u03a0y ),\n~\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03a0 = p + ec A, \u03c3i (i = x, y, z) are the Pauli matrices for electron spin, gs is the Lande g-factor, \u03bcB is the\nBohr magneton, \u03b1 and \u03b2 represent the Rashba and the\nDresselhaus spin-orbit couplings, respectively. Here we\nchoose the Landau guage A = yB x\u0302. Note that px = k is\na good quantum number due to [px , H] = 0.\nThe Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit interactions\noriginate from the lack of structure and bulk inversion\nsymmetries, respectively [7,8]. The Rashba coupling \u03b1\ncan be adjusted by a gate voltage perpendicular to the\n2DEG plane [12,13]. Therefore, in experiments, an arbitrary ratio of two kinds of spin-orbit couplings can be\nobtained in different samples by changing the gate voltage. The relative strength of the Rashba and Dresselhaus\ncouplings can be extracted from the photocurrent measurements [14,15]. Usually the coefficients \u03b1 and \u03b2 have\nthe same order of magnitude in quantum wells such as\nGaAs while in narrow gap compounds such as InAs, \u03b1\ndominates [12,13].\nWhen B = 0, the Hamiltonian (1) has been studied by\na lot of authors [16-19]. In Refs. [16,17], the spin Hall\neffect was investigated by using the Heisenberg equation\nof motion and the Kubo formalism approaches, respectively. The out of plane spin current only depends on the\nsign of \u03b2 2 \u2212 \u03b12 for \u03b1 6= \u03b2 and vanishes at \u03b1 = \u03b2. We note\nthat when \u03b1 = \u03b2, the Hamiltonian (1) has some special\nsymmetries and its spin state of the wavefunction is independent of the wave vector. This property was proposed\nto design a non-ballistic spin-field-effect transistor [18].\nIn addition, due to an exact SU(2) spin rotation symmetry, a Persistent Spin Helix, whose lifetime is infinite,\nwas discovered at this point [19].\nWhen B 6= 0, the Hamiltonian (1) with a pure Rashba\ncoupling (i.e. \u03b2 = 0) was solved by Rashba over fourty\n\n\f2\n\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\n\u03b2m lc\nlc\naR = \u03b1m\n~ 2 , aD =\n~2 , u\u03c3 = \u03c3[1 \u2212 isgn(\u03b1\u03b2)], and the\norbital index\n\u03c3\n=\n\u00b11\n[11]. Here we point out that two\np\nconstants |aR aD |u\u03c3 in the operators bk\u03c3 play an important role in solving the Hamiltonian (1). Obviously,\ndifferent from the pure Rashba or Dresselhaus coupling\ncase, the orbital space of electron is divided into two\nindependent infinite-dimensional subspaces described by\nthe occupied number representations \u0393\u03c3 associated with\nbk\u03c3 and b\u2020k\u03c3 . Then the Hamiltonian (1) is rewritten as\nH = H\u22121 \u2295 H1 , where H\u03c3 is the sub-Hamiltonian in\n\u0393\u03c3 . The exact solution for the Hamiltonian (1) can be\nexpressed as an infinite series in terms of the free Landau levels in each \u0393\u03c3 and the physical parameters. The\nenergy level splitting is dependent on the Landau level\nnumber when |aR | 6= |aD | while the energy spectrum has\nan equal-distant-like structure if |aR | = |aD |. When the\nspin-orbit couplings \u03b1 and \u03b2 are small, the exact results\nare consistent with those obtained by the perturbation\ntheory and truncation approximation [21,22]. In this\nwork, we focus on the magnetic and transport properties of the Hamiltonian (1) at |aR | = |aD | (i.e. |\u03b1| = |\u03b2|),\nwhich can be realized by the photocurrent experiment\n[14,15].\nWhen |aD | = |aR | = a, the eigenvalue for the nth\nLandau level with the spin index s and the orbital index\n\u03c3 is given by [11]\n\nEns\u03c3 = ~\u03c9(n +\n\n1 p\n1\n+ 2a2 + s g 2 + 64a4 ).\n2\n2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere s = \u00b11, the cyclotron frequency \u03c9 = meB\u2217 c , and g =\ngs m\u2217\n2me with me the free electron mass. Note that Ens\u03c3 is\nindependent of the orbital index \u03c3. In other words, there\nis the same energy spectrum in each \u0393\u03c3 . Obviously, the\nenergy splitting induced by the Zeeman energy and spinorbit coupling is independent of the\npLandau level index n,\ni.e. \u2206E = Ens=1 \u2212 Ens=\u22121 = ~\u03c9 g 2 + 64a4 . In Fig. 1,\nwe present several low-lying Landau levels changing with\nthe parameter a when g = 0.1. Obviously, all the nearest\n1\n1\nneighboring Landau levels cross at a\u2217 = 2\u221a\n(1 \u2212 g 2 ) 4 .\n2\nThe eigenstate corresponding to the eigenvalue (2)\n\n8\n\nLandau energy Level EnsV\n\nyears ago [7]. The Landau levels of 2DEG with a pure\nDresselhaus coupling (i.e. \u03b1 = 0) can be obtained by\nthe unitary transformation \u03c3x \u2192 \u03c3y , \u03c3y \u2192 \u03c3x and\n\u03c3z \u2192 \u2212\u03c3z , which maps a 2DEG with Rashba coupling\n\u03b1, Dresselhaus coupling \u03b2, and Lande g-factor gs to a\n2DEG with Rashba coupling \u03b2, Dresselhaus coupling \u03b1,\nand Lande g-factor \u2212gs [20,21]. When the Rashba and\nDresselhaus couplings coexist, the Hamiltonian (1) becomes very complicated and its solution is not obtained\nfor many years. Very recently, the problem has been\nsolved by using unitary transformations and introducing\nc\n(k +\ntwo bosonic annihilation operators bk\u03c3 = \u221a12l [y + eB\nc\np\noperipy ) + |aR aD |u\u03c3 ] and the corresponding creationq\n\u2020\n~c\n\u2020\nators bk\u03c3 = (bk\u03c3 ) , with the cyclotron radius lc = eB\n,\n\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n\n*\n\na\n\n0\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\na\nFIG. 1: (Color online).

All the\ncrossings of the nearest neighboring Landau levels locate on\nthe dot line at a\u2217 , which give rise to resonant spin and charge\nHall conductances. Near the point (slightly larger than a\u2217 ),\nthere is a resonant spin polarization, which can also induce\nresonant spin and charge Hall effects.\n\nreads [11]\n|n, k, s, \u03c3 >=\n\n\u03bbnms\n\n1\nAns\u03c3\n\n+\u221e\nX\n\nm=0\n\n\u03b1n\u03c3\nms\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n\u03bbnms T\u03c3\n\n\u0013\n\n\u03c6mk\u03c3 ,\n\np\ng 2 + 64a4\np\n,\n=\n1\n1\nn \u2212 m + 4a2 \u2212 2 g + 2 s g 2 + 64a4\nn \u2212 m + 4a2 + 12 g + 12 s\n\nT\u03c3 =\n\n\u221a\n2\n\u03c3(sgn\u03b2 + isgn\u03b1),\n2\n\n|Ans\u03c3 |2 =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n2\n(1 + \u03bb2nms )|\u03b1n\u03c3\nms | ,\n\n(3)\n\nm=0\n\nwhere \u03c6mk\u03c3 is the eigenstate of the\n\u221a mth Landau level in\u221a \u0393\u03c3 , i.e. b\u2020k\u03c3 \u03c6mk\u03c3 =\nm + 1\u03c6m+1k\u03c3 ,\nbk\u03c3 \u03c6mk\u03c3 = m\u03c6m\u22121k\u03c3 , < \u03c6m\u2032 k\u03c3\u2032 |\u03c6mk\u03c3 >= \u03b4mm\u2032 \u03b4\u03c3\u03c3\u2032 ,\nn\u03c3\nlim m\u2192+\u221e \u03b1n\u03c3\nms = 0, and the coefficient \u03b1ms satisfies the\nrecursion relation\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u2217\nn\u03c3\nmau\u03c3 (1+\u03bbnm\u22121s )\u03b1n\u03c3\nm\u22121s + m + 1au\u03c3 (1+\u03bbnm+1s )\u03b1m+1s\n1 p\n1\n\u2212(n \u2212 m + g + s g 2 + 64a4 \u2212 4a2 \u03bbnms )\u03b1n\u03c3\nms = 0. (4)\n2\n2\nObviously, the expectation value of any physical quantity in the nth Landau level is completely determined by\n\u03bbnms and \u03b1n\u03c3\nms . When g = 0, from Eq. (6), we have\nthe exact solutions: (i) \u03bbnns=\u22121 = \u22121, \u03b1n\u03c3\nns=\u22121 = 1\nand \u03b1n\u03c3\n=\n0\nfor\nm\n=\n6\nn;\n(ii)\n\u03bb\n= 1 and\nnms=1\nms=\u22121\n\u03b1m\u03c3\nsatisfy\nthe\nrelation\n(4)\nwith\nthe\nreplacement\nof\nns=1\nparameters. It is easy to prove that when g = 0,\n\n\f3\nthere is no spin polarization in each Landau level, i.e.\n< n, k, s, \u03c3| ~2 \u03c3z |n, k, s, \u03c3 >= 0. So it is not expected\nthat there exists an out of plane spin current. In this\ncase, the orbital and spin wave\nfunctions of electrons are\n\u221a\nseparated, and the spin part 22 (1 sT\u03c3 )T is independent\nof the wave vector k, which is similar to that observed\nin the absence of a magnetic field [18]. In the following,\nwe calculate spin polarization, spin and charge Hall conductances in the Hamiltonian (1) with g 6= 0 at high and\nlow magnetic fields by using the exact energy spectrum\ndescribed by Eqs. (2)-(4).\nUsing the eigenstates (3) and the recursion relation (4),\nthe expectation value of spin polarization per electron is\nSz =\n\n=\n\n1 X\n~\n< n, k, s, \u03c3| \u03c3z |n, k, s, \u03c3 > f (Ens\u03c3 )\n2\u03bd ns\u03c3\n2\n\n~ X\n1\n2\n(1 \u2212 \u03bb2nms )|\u03b1n\u03c3\nms | f (Ens\u03c3 ),\n4\u03bd nms\u03c3 |Ans\u03c3 |2\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03bd is the filling factor and f (x) is the Fermi distribution function. Note that two in the denominator of\nthe first expression of Sz comes from two orbital subspaces. In Figs. 2(a) and 2(d), we show the zero temperature spin polarization curves at high and low magnetic fields, respectively. In our calculations, we have\nchosen the parameters \u03b1 = \u03b2 = 0.9 \u00d7 10\u221211 eVm,\nne = 1.9 \u00d7 1016 /m2 , gs = 4, and m\u2217 = 0.05me , taken\nfor In0.53 Ga0.47 As/In0.52 Al0.48 As quantum well [12,15].\nThe purposes of this parameter choice are to compare\nwith the results in 2DEG with pure Rashba coupling in\nRefs. [10,21] and to understand the role of the competition between the spin-orbit interactions and the Zeeman\nenergy. However, we verified that varying these parameters in a reasonable range does not qualitatively change\n\nGsz,c =\n\n1\nE\n\nX\n\nnn\u2032 kss\u2032 \u03c3\n\n[\n\nour results. Because of the particular symmetry in this\nsystem, the spin polarization has many special features,\ncompared to the case of the pure Rashba or Dresselhaus\ncoupling. At high magnetic fields, the spin polarization\nalmost vanishes between 5T \u223c 20T. This is the result\nof the competition between the Zeeman energy and the\nspin-orbit couplings. Below 5T, the spin polarization oscillates with the magnetic field due to the alternate filling\nof the Landau levels. At low magnetic fields, we can see\nin Fig. 2(d) that Sz has a finite jump at the energy level\n1\nT), similar to the case of the pure\ncrossing a\u2217 (B \u2248 5.44\nRashba coupling [10]. More interestingly, a resonant spin\npolarization is discovered near the degenerate point, i.e.\n1\nT, which is one of the main results in this paper.\nB \u2248 5.46\nThis resonant phenomenon is produced by the property\nof the quantity \u03bbnms . We shall see below that the resonant spin polarization induces resonant spin and charge\nHall effects, which is never reported before.\nIn order to investigate the spin and charge transport\nproperties in 2DEG, we apply a tiny electric field E along\nthe y axis. So the potential energy H \u2032 = eEy, treated as\na perturbation term, must be added into the Hamiltonian\n(1). The operator y can be expressed in terms of the\nbosonic\noperators b\u03c3 and b\u2020\u03c3 in each subspace \u0393\u03c3 , i.e. y =\n\u221a\n\u2020\n2\nck\n2 lc (bk\u03c3 + bk\u03c3 ) \u2212 eB \u2212 \u03c3a. The charge current operator\nof a single electron in \u0393\u03c3 reads jc\u03c3 = \u2212evx\u03c3 while the\ncorresponding out of plane spin current operator in \u0393\u03c3\nis jsz\u03c3 = ~4 (\u03c3z vx\u03c3 + vx\u03c3 \u03c3z ). Here, the electron velocity\n~\n1\n[b\u2020k\u03c3 +\n[x, H\u03c3 + H\u03c3\u2032 ] = \u221a2m\nin \u0393 along x axis vx\u03c3 = i~\n\u2217l\nc\n\u221a\nbk\u03c3 + 2a(\u03c3y sgn\u03b1 + \u03c3x sgn\u03b2 \u2212 l\u03c3c )]. Up to the first order\nin the electric field E in the expectation value of the\nspin or charge current operator, then spin or charge Hall\nconductance, i.e. the coefficient of the linear term, can\nbe expressed as [10,22]\n\n< n\u2032 , k, s\u2032 , \u03c3|H\u03c3\u2032 |n, k, s, \u03c3 >< n, k, s, \u03c3|jsz\u03c3,c\u03c3 |n\u2032 , k, s\u2032 , \u03c3 >\nf (Ens\u03c3 ) + h.c.],\nEns\u03c3 \u2212 En\u2032 s\u2032 \u03c3\n\nwhere the matrix elements < n\u2032 , k, s\u2032 , \u03c3|H\u03c3\u2032 |n, k, s, \u03c3 >,\n<\nn\u2032 , k, s\u2032 , \u03c3|jsz\u03c3 |n, k, s, \u03c3\n>,\nand\n<\n\u2032\n\u2032\nn , k, s , \u03c3|jc\u03c3 |n, k, s, \u03c3 > can be easily obtained by\nusing the eigenstate (3). Obviously, Gsz ang Gc are\nhighly nonlinear functions in terms of the parameters a\nand g, which reveal abundant transport characteristics\nin this special system. We note that when a \u2192 0,\nEq. (6) is consistent with that in 2DEG with pure\nRashba (Dresselhaus) spin-orbit interaction in the limit\nof vanishing coupling strength [10,21].\nAccording to the formula (6), we plot the curves of Gsz\n\n(6)\n\nand Gc at zero temperature as a function of B1 in Figs.\n2(b), 2(e), 2(c) and 2(f). Similar to the curve of Sz ,\nGsz and Gc almost vanish in the magnetic field interval\n[5T, 20T). This feature does not appear in the spin and\ncharge Hall conductances in 2DEG with pure Rashba or\nDresselhaus coupling [10,21]. Below 5T, Gsz possesses\nan amplitude varying saw tooth structure with a period\n\u223c 0.024T \u22121 while Gc has a step-like form with the same\nperiod. Contrary to the case of the pure Rashba coupling,\nthe charge Hall conductance Gc strongly depends on the\nspin-orbit coupling strength.

The sample parameters used here are\n\u03b1 = \u03b2 = 0.9 \u00d7 10\u221211 eVm, ne = 1.9 \u00d7 1016 /m2 , gs = 4, and\nm\u2217 = 0.05me .\n\nfield region shown in Figs. 2(e) and 2(f), both Gsz and\nGc have two resonant peaks at and near a\u2217 , which are\ninduced by the energy level crossings and the resonant\nspin polarization, respectively. The resonant peak of Gsz\nand Gc induced by the resonant spin polarization is much\nhigher than that produced by the energy level crossings.\nHere we point out that very different from the case of the\npure Rashba coupling, the resonant spin Hall effect at a\u2217\nis easily observed by experiments because an energy level\ncrossing always exists at the Fermi level. When B \u2192 0,\nthe spin Hall conductance vanishes, which recovers the\nresult in the absence of a magnetic field [16,17].\nIn summary, we have studied the spin polarization,\nspin and charge Hall conductances in 2DEG in the presence of equal Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit interactions under a perpendicular magnetic field by employing\nthe exact solution for the Hamiltonian (1). Besides the\nresonant phenomena at the energy level crossing, we have\ndiscovered a resonance spin polarization near the degenerate point. The resonant spin polarization can lead simultaneously to both resonant spin and charge Hall conductances. Furthermore, the resonant charge Hall effect\nis not found in the other semiconductor systems up to\nnow. We emphasize that the results obtained here de-\n\n[1] S. Murakami, N. Nagaosa, and S. C.
