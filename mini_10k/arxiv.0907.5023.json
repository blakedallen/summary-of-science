It would\nbe very interesting to understand similar correspondences involving non-supersymmetric\nblack holes. A natural starting point is to consider the near-horizon geometry of an\nextreme Kerr black hole [2, 3], which was shown in [3] to be described by a spacetime with isometry group SL(2, R) \u00d7 U(1). This spacetime is known either as the\nextremal (or extreme) Kerr throat [3] or as the Near-Horizon Extreme Kerr (NHEK)\ngeometry [4]. We shall use these terms interchangeably below.\nThe asymptotic symmetry group of this spacetime was recently investigated in\n[4], under a certain set of boundary conditions that we shall call GHSS fall-off. The\nintriguing result was that this group contains a Virasoro algebra whose central charge\nis related via Cardy's formula to the entropy of the Kerr black hole. As a result,\n[4] conjectured that the physics of the near-horizon geometry of an extreme Kerr\nblack hole is dual to a 1+1 chiral CFT. Similar results have now been shown to hold\nfor very general extreme rotating black holes (see e.g. [5] and references therein for\nd \u2265 4 as well as [6] for BTZ black holes). One also finds [7] that scattering off of\nextreme Kerr black holes is consistent with a CFT description.\nRoughly speaking, the CFT should be associated with the t, \u03c6 directions which\ndescribe the time-translation and rotation-symmetries of the extreme Kerr throat.\nOne therefore expects the objects which describe the CFT (for example, the stress\ntensor) to be covariant with respect to diffeomorphisms of the form t, \u03c6 \u2192 xi (t, \u03c6),\n1\n\n\fwhere xi are new boundary coordinates. Yet, the original constructions of [4] are not\nof this form and give special status to t = constant surfaces. Indeed, as we will see,\nthe symplectic norm defined in [4] is not conserved when evaluated on more general\nsurfaces. We also identify a related problem involving integrability of the charges\ndefined in [4].\nWe show below that both issues can be resolved by adding a suitable boundary counter-term to the symplectic structure. Similar boundary counter-terms were\npreviously studied in [8, 9], where they were shown to be closely related to counterterms in the action. As a result, one may consider our work below as a first step\ntoward holographic renormalization of the action for Kerr/CFT along the lines of\ne.g. [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15].\nOur counter-term is constructed so as to give no contribution to symplectic products evaluated on constant t surfaces. As a result, it does not affect the primary\nconclusions reported in [4]; the main effect is to render them covariant, so that any\nsurfaces may be used for the computations. In addition, our counter-term also fixes\nthe above-mentioned problem with integrability. The covariant description allows us\nto compute a covariant differential stress tensor describing the difference between two\nnearby solutions. This differential stress tensor is essentially a boundary analogue of\nthe so-called canonical stress tensor familiar from scalar field theories (see e.g. [16]).\nOur analysis is greatly simplified by making use of the conjecture of [17, 18] that all\nsolutions satisfying GHSS fall-off are diffeomorphic to the extreme Kerr throat.\nWe begin with a brief review of the NHEK geometry in section 2. We then\nanalyze the phase space in section 3, finding the required counter-term for the symplectic structure. With a truly covariant phase space in hand, we then construct the\nboundary stress tensor in section 4. We close with some interpretation and a brief\ndiscussion of other issues in Kerr/CFT.\n\n2\n\nThe extremal Kerr throat\n\nTo orient the reader and establish conventions, we begin by recalling how the extremal\nKerr throat can be obtained as a scaling limit of the Kerr geometry [3]. The general\nKerr metric is labeled by two parameters, a mass M and angular momentum J = Ma.\nThe resulting black hole has temperature\n\u221a\nM 2 \u2212 a2\n\u221a\nT\u0303 =\n(2.1)\n4\u03c0M(M + M 2 \u2212 a2 )\n\n2\n\n\fand entropy S = 2\u03c0M(M +\nthe metric takes the form\n\n\u221a\n\nM 2 \u2212 a2 ).

Note that we have set\nNewton's constant G = 1.\nDefining a one-parameter family of new coordinate systems\nr\u0303 = M + \u03bbr, t\u0303 = t/\u03bb, \u03c6\u0303 = \u03c6 + t/2M\u03bb\nand taking the scaling limit \u03bb \u2192 0 yields\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0003 2r02 sin2 \u03b8\n1 + cos2 \u03b8 \u0002\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\u2212f dt + dr /f + r0 d\u03b8 +\nds =\n(d\u03c6 + r/r02dt)2 ,\n2\n2\n1 + cos \u03b8\n\n(2.5)\n\n(2.6)\n\nwith r02 = 2M 2 and f = r 2 /r02 . This spacetime is known either as the extremal Kerr\nthroat or as the Near-Horizon Extreme Kerr (NHEK) geometry. For fixed \u03b8, the\nterm in square brackets becomes the metric on AdS2 in Poincar\u00e9 coordinates. As a\nresult, we refer to (t, r, \u03b8, \u03c6) as Poincar\u00e9 coordinates for the extremal Kerr throat.\nThe throat geometry inherits many properties from the above-mentioned AdS2 .\nFor example, a geodesically complete spacetime can be obtained by applying the\ncoordinate transformation\ncos t\u2032 + r \u2032 sin t\u2032\n(1 + r \u20322 )1/2 sin t\u2032\n,\n, \u03c6 = \u03c6\u2032 + log\nr\n1 + (1 + r \u20322 )1/2 sin t\u2032\n(2.7)\nwhich takes Poincar\u00e9 AdS2 to the standard global coordinates on AdS2 [3]. The\nresult is just\n\u0012\n\u0015\n\u0013\n\u0013\u0014 \u0012\n1 + cos2 \u03b8\n2r02 sin2 \u03b8\ndr 2\nr2\n2\n2\n2\n2\nds =\n+ r0 d\u03b8 +\n\u2212 1 + 2 dt +\n(d\u03c6+r/r02dt)2 ,\n2\n2\n2\n2\nr0\n1 + r /r0\n1 + cos \u03b8\n(2.8)\nwhere we have dropped the primes on coordinates in (2.8) for simplicity. The result\nis precisely of the form (2.6) with f replaced by 1 + r 2 /r02 . This form of the metric\nis known as the NHEK geometry in global coordinates. One notes that it has two\nr = (1 + r \u20322 )1/2 cos t\u2032 + r \u2032 , t =\n\n3\n\n\fboundaries, at r = \u00b1\u221e. Below, we will write all expressions in terms of the global\ncoordinates (t, r, \u03b8, \u03c6) used in (2.8) and we will set r0 = 1. It will sometimes be\nconvenient to make the additional coordinate change x \u2261 cos \u03b8. When making\nvarious expansions about the NHEK geometry, we will denote the metric (2.8) as\nthe background metric \u1e21. One can also find other coordinates in which this same\nspacetime becomes a black hole of any finite temperature T [17, 18].\nThe throat geometry also inherits the isometries of AdS2 . These are well-known\nto form an SL(2, R) algebra and are given by\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u221a\nr cos t\n1\n1\ncos t\n\u2212 \u221a\n\u03b7\u22121 =\n\u2202t \u2212 sin t 1 + r 2 \u2202r \u2212 \u221a\n\u2202\u03c6 ,\n(2.9)\n2\n2 2 1+r\n2\n2 1 + r2\n\u221a\nr sin t\nsin t\n\u03b70 = \u221a\n\u2202t \u2212 cos t 1 + r 2 \u2202r + \u221a\n\u2202\u03c6\n(2.10)\n2\n1+r\n1 + r2\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u221a\nr cos t\ncos t\n\u2202\u03c6 ,\n(2.11)\n\u2202t + sin t 1 + r 2 \u2202r + \u221a\n\u03b71 =\n1+ \u221a\n2\n1+r\n1 + r2\nin global coordinates. The Lie brackets of these vector fields satisfy\n[\u03b70 , \u03b7\u00b11 ] = \u2213\u03b7\u00b11 ,\n\n[\u03b71 , \u03b7\u22121 ] = \u03b70 .\n\n(2.12)\n\nThere is also one additional Killing field, \u03be0 = \u2202\u03c6 , which commutes with all \u03b7i . The\nglobal time translation is \u2202t = 12 \u03b71 + \u03b7\u22121 .\n\n3\n\nThe covariant phase space\n\nThe basic idea of [4] was to consider a certain space of solutions asymptotic to the\nextreme Kerr throat (2.6) and to analyze the symmetries of the resulting phase space.\nThe space of solutions was determined by first specifying certain fall-off conditions\nat large r of the form\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nhtt = O(r 2 ) htr = O(r \u22122 ) ht\u03b8 = O(r \u22121 ) ht\u03c6 = O(1)\n\uf8ec\nhrr = O(r \u22123 ) hr\u03b8 = O(r \u22122 ) hr\u03c6 = O(r \u22121 ) \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n(3.13)\nhab = \uf8ec\n\uf8ed\nh\u03b8\u03b8 = O(r \u22121 ) h\u03b8\u03c6 = O(r \u22121 ) \uf8f8\nh\u03c6\u03c6 = O(1)\nand then restricting to those solutions with vanishing energy, by which we mean\nthe charge asymptotically associated with the vector field \u2202t . The restriction on the\nenergy was motivated in part by the desire to study ground states of the Kerr black\nhole, but also in part by the fact that (3.13) did not immediately guarantee that\n4\n\n\fthe energy was finite. Restricting to zero-energy solutions was thus a way to avoid\ncertain potential divergences.\nThis zero-energy condition was then analyzed further in [17, 18], where it was\nargued to follow from the fall-off conditions (3.13). We refer to (3.13) supplemented\nby this condition as GHSS boundary conditions. Ref. [17] argued that the other\nSL(2, R) charges must vanish as well. A similar statement was argued to hold for\nthe U(1) charge, with the exception that this charge can be carried by boundary\ngravitons. Furthermore, [17, 18] showed that the only solutions to the linearized\nequations which satisfy at all times (3.13) and the constraint that these charges\nvanish are linearized diffeomorphisms1 . In [17], these conclusions were argued to\nhold under more general boundary conditions as well. As a result, [17, 18] tentatively\nreached the conclusion that all solutions satisfying GHSS fall-off are diffeomorphic\nto (2.6). We will use this conjecture to greatly simplify our analysis below.\nWe now turn to the construction of the covariant phase space. Recall that the\nbasic object in this procedure is the symplectic current \u03c9 a , which is closely connected\nwith both the action and the equations of motion (see e.g. [19, 20, 21, 22, 23] for\nvarious discussions in the gravitational context). The symplectic current is a vector\nfield on spacetime, but it is also a two-form on the space of solutions, meaning that\nit depends on a point in the solution space (which we think of as a metric g) and\ntwo tangent vectors to this solution space at g. Such tangent vectors \u03b41 g, \u03b42 g are\nsimply solutions to the linearized equations of motion about g which extend to oneparameter families of non-linear solutions; i.e., to curves in the specified phase space.\nFor each choice of linearized solutions \u03b41 g, \u03b42 g, the symplectic current is covariantly\nconserved: \u2207a \u03c9 a = 0, where \u2207a is the covariant derivative compatible with the\nmetric g.\nThe integral of this current over a complete hypersurface \u03a3 defines the symplectic\nstructure:\nZ\n\u221a\n\u03a9\u03a3 [g; \u03b41g, \u03b42 g] =\ng\u03a3 na \u03c9 a ,\n(3.14)\n\u03a3\n\na\n\nwhere g\u03a3 is the induced metric on \u03a3 and n is the unit normal. Covariant conservation of \u03c9 a means that \u03a9\u03a3 \u2212 \u03a9\u03a3\u2032 can be related to the flux F of \u03c9 a through any\nsurface R for which \u2202R = \u2202\u03a3 \u2212 \u2202\u03a3\u2032 ; i.e., to the flux of \u03c9 a through the boundary.\nIn order to define a good phase space, (3.14) must be finite and conserved. In\nparticular, the flux through the boundary must vanish. These properties were not\n1\n\nInterestingly, it is no problem to find initial data where the charges vanish. The problem is that\nthe charges are not conserved. As a result, the Cauchy problem with GHSS boundary conditions\ndoes not appear to be well-defined. Classifying solutions is therefore not equivalent to classifying\ninitial data.\n\n5\n\n\fdirectly checked in [4], though some related properties (finiteness and a form of integrability) were explored for certain charges constructed from (3.14) for the particular\ncase of hypersurfaces \u03a3 on which t = constant. We will discuss charges in section 4,\nand concentrate for the moment on the symplectic structure itself.\nAs emphasized in [8, 9], the correct choice of symplectic structure for a given\nproblem can depend on the boundary conditions. A useful way of organizing the\ndiscussion is to suppose that one has at hand the complete action for the system,\nincluding any boundary terms required to yield a well-defined variational principle.\nIn this case, [8, 9] show how to obtain a symplectic current \u03c9 a for which the flux of\nthis current through the boundary vanishes under the boundary conditions that make\nthe action stationary. Of course, changing the boundary conditions may require the\naddition of new boundary terms to the action. The new action then defines a new\nsymplectic current \u03c9\u0303 a which differs from the original current \u03c9 a by what is effectively\nalso a \"boundary term.\" By this we mean that \u03c9\u0303 = \u03c9 \u2212 dB for some (d \u2212 2)-form\nB, where (in d spacetime dimensions) \u03c9 is the (d \u2212 1)-form dual to the symplectic\ncurrent \u03c9 a . Furthermore, just as the action may require certain boundary terms in\norder to render it finite, the correct boundary term B in the symplectic structure\ncan also be critical to ensuring finiteness of \u03c9\u0303. Refs. [8, 9] explored situations of this\nsort in anti-de Sitter space, where the well-known \"counter-terms\" in the action (see\ne.g. [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]) lead to corresponding counter-terms in \u03c9 a .\nIn the NHEK context we do not yet have a complete useful variational principle\nfrom which to construct \u03c9 a ; i.e., the analogue of holographic renormalization in AdS\nhas not yet been performed. We therefore cannot directly calculate a unique symplectic structure. However, since we study vacuum general relativity, the bulk action\nis just the Einstein-Hilbert action. As is well known [19, 20, 21], this determines\n\u03c9 up to the addition of a boundary term (dB) of the sort discussed above. The\nmessage we take from [8] is that this boundary term may nevertheless be dictated by\nthe choice of boundary conditions, and cannot be chosen arbitrarily. In particular,\nthe boundary term should be chosen so that the flux of \u03c9 through the boundary\nvanishes2 .\nThe particular symplectic structure used in [4] was that of [23]:\n\u03c9 a [g; \u03b41 g, \u03b42g] = \u2212P abcdef (\u03b42 gcd \u2207b \u03b41 gef \u2212 (1 \u2194 2)) ,\n2\n\n(3.15)\n\nIn general, it would be better to say that one must choose the boundary conditions and the\nboundary term dB together so that this flux vanishes. Here, however, we take the point of view that\nwe wish to use precisely the GHSS fall-off conditions of [4] in order to have the same asymptotic\nsymmetry group.\n\n6\n\n\fwhere\nP abcdef =\n\n1\ng ab g e(c g d)f + g cdg a(e g f )b + g ef g a(c g d)b\n32\u03c0\n\u0001\n\u2212g ab g cdg ef \u2212 g a(e g f )(c g d)b \u2212 g a(c g d)(e g f )b .\n\n(3.16)\n\nA useful property is that, as reviewed in section 4, for generally covariant theories\n\u03c9 must be an exact form whenever \u03b42 g is the infinitesimal change of g under a\ndiffeomorphism (i.e., \u03b42 g = \u00a3\u03be g) [19, 20, 21, 22, 23]. In particular, for (3.15) we have\n[22, 23] \u03c9[g; \u03b41g, \u00a3\u03b6 g] = dk\u03b6 [\u03b41 g, g] where\n\u0014\n1\n1\n\u01ebabcd \u03b6 d \u2207c (g ef \u03b41 gef ) \u2212 \u03b6 d\u2207f \u03b41 g cf + \u03b6f \u2207d \u03b41 g cf + (g ef \u03b41 gef )\u2207d \u03b6 c\nk\u03b6 [\u03b41 g, g] = \u2212\n32\u03c0\n2\n\u0015\n1\n\u2212\u03b41 g cf \u2207f \u03b6 d + \u03b41 g f c (\u2207d \u03b6f + \u2207f \u03b6 d ) dxa \u2227 dxb .\n(3.17)\n2\nThe symplectic structure (3.15) corresponds to fixing the ambiguity \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c9 \u2212 dB\nmentioned above in such a way that (3.15) can be constructed directly from the\nequations of motion without the need for a Lagrangian. While this is an appealing\nproperty, there is no a priori guarantee that (3.15) is in fact appropriate for GHSS\nfall-off.\nIndeed, it turns out that the corresponding \u03a9\u03a3 is not conserved. Furthermore, \u03a9\u03a3\ndiverges unless \u03a3 asymptotically approaches a constant t hypersurface. To see this,\nwe must calculate (3.15) at large r. As in [4], we shall confine ourselves to studying\nsmall perturbations about the NHEK solution \u1e21. This analysis is greatly simplified by\nassuming that, as argued in [17], all solutions which obey the boundary conditions\n(3.13) are diffeomorphic to (2.6). It follows that the only tangent vectors to the\nspace of solutions are linearized diffeomorphisms. As shown in [4], the linearized\ndiffeomorphisms about \u1e21 which preserve GHSS fall-off are of the form\n\u03b6 = \u03be\u01eb(\u03c6) + c1 \u2202t + c2 \u03b7 + \u03c7sub ,\n\n(3.18)\n\nat each boundary. Here, we have defined\n\u03be\u01eb = \u2212r\u01eb\u2032 (\u03c6)\u2202r + \u01eb(\u03c6)\u2202\u03c6\n\nfor any function \u01eb(\u03c6) ,\n\n\u03b7 = t\u2202t \u2212 r\u2202r ,\n\n(3.19)\n(3.20)\n\nand the subleading terms take the form [4]\n\u03c7sub =\n\nC t (t, \u03b8, \u03c6)\nC \u03b8 (t, \u03b8, \u03c6)\nC \u03c6 (t, \u03b8, \u03c6)\nr\n\u2202\n+\nC\n(t,\n\u03b8,\n\u03c6)\n\u2202\n+\n\u2202\n+\n\u2202\u03c6 + . . .\nt\nr\n\u03b8\nr3\nr\nr2\n7\n\n(3.21)\n\n\ffor some arbitrary functions C t , C r , C \u03b8 , C \u03c6 . We will comment further on the precise\nmeaning of (3.21) in section 4. (The term involving \u03b7 seems to have been inadvertently omitted in [4], but \u03b7 also respects their boundary conditions.) As discussed\nin [4], the non-trivial parts of (3.18) are determined by the Virasoro terms (3.19).\nWe note in passing that other boundary conditions [24, 25] have been suggested\nfor Kerr/CFT which allow certain so-called \"right-moving\" Virasoro generators in\naddition to the \"left-movers\" above (3.19). However, the fact that these right-moving\ngenerators appear to contain arbitrary functions of time suggests that in a fully\nconsistent framework they can define only gauge transformations. In particular,\non general grounds (see footnote 4 in section 4), the corresponding charges should\nvanish identically in a theory with a conserved symplectic structure. Consistency\nthen requires any right-moving central charge to vanish. As a result, we do not\nconsider such boundary conditions further.\nA general vector field preserving GHSS fall-off can be decomposed into one piece\nthat vanishes as r \u2192 \u2212\u221e but approaches (3.18) as r \u2192 \u221e and a second piece which\nvanishes as r \u2192 \u221e but approaches (3.18) as r \u2192 \u2212\u221e. Now, as noted above, one\nmay write (3.15) in the form \u03c9 = dk where k is locally constructed (see eqn 3.17)\nfrom \u03b62 , \u03b41 g = \u00a3\u03b61 \u1e21, and \u1e21. Thus, the symplectic product \u03a9\u03a3 [\u1e21; \u00a3\u03b61 \u1e21, \u00a3\u03b62 \u1e21] can be\nwritten as a local integral over \u2202\u03a3. It follows that \u03a9\u03a3 vanishes when \u03b61 and \u03b62 are\nsupported at opposite boundaries. Below, we choose counter-terms which preserve\nthis very natural behavior. It is therefore sufficient to confine our analysis to the\nboundary at r \u2192 \u221e, taking all diffeomorphisms to be of the form (3.18) as r \u2192 \u221e\nand to be trivial as r \u2192 \u2212\u221e. These diffeomorphisms will define a non-trivial stress\ntensor at r = +\u221e, but will not contribute to the stress tensor at r = \u2212\u221e. Of course,\none obtains analogous results if the boundaries are interchanged.\nAs noted in [4], the vector fields (3.19) are not smooth at the poles of the sphere\n(\u03b8 = 0, \u03c0). Nonetheless, there are sufficiently smooth vector fields \u03b6 whose asymptotic\nbehavior is given by (3.19). For definiteness, we use the regulated Virasoro generators\n\u03be \u0303\u01eb = R(r)\n\nr 2 sin2 \u03b8\n(\u01eb(\u03c6)\u2202\u03c6 \u2212 r\u01eb\u2032 (\u03c6)\u2202r )\n1 + r 2 sin2 \u03b8\n\n(3.22)\n\nin the calculations below. Here R(r) is any smooth function that tends to 1 as r \u2192 \u221e\nand to 0 as r \u2192 \u2212\u221e with corrections of order O(r \u22121 ).\nAfter some calculation, one finds that the symplectic flux due to a Virasoro\ndiffeomorphism through some region R of the (t, \u03c6) cylinder at r = \u221e is\nZ\nF [\u1e21; \u00a3\u03be\u03031 \u1e21, \u00a3\u03be\u03032 \u1e21] =\ndtd\u03c6 \u2202\u03c6 [O(r log r) + . . .] ,\n(3.23)\n(t,\u03c6)\u2208R\nr\u2192\u221e\n\n8\n\n\fwhere we have already performed the \u03b8 integral before taking the r \u2192 \u221e limit.\nFor regions R bounded by constant time surfaces, one can use the fact that the\nintegrand is a total \u03c6 derivative to argue that it gives a vanishing contribution to the\nflux. However, for generic R the flux diverges as r \u2192 \u221e. Because F \u223c \u03a9\u03a3 \u2212 \u03a9\u03a3\u2032 ,\nit follows that perturbations \u03b4g = \u00a3\u03be\u0303 \u1e21 are not normalizeable with respect to the\nsymplectic structure on generic surfaces. Similar results hold for the unregulated\ngenerators (3.19) and for regulators not of the form (3.22).\nThus, we see that (3.15) does not lead to a well-defined covariant phase space under GHSS fall-off. One can of course choose to define the theory only on t = constant\nslices. However, were this the end of the story, it would suggest that any dual theory\nis non-local, as outgoing flux from one region of the boundary would in general be\nbalanced only by ingoing flux in a completely different region3 . In particular, one\nwould expect no covariantly conserved stress tensor, since the expected conserved\nquantities could not be defined on general surfaces.\nOn the other hand, as discussed above, it is natural to ask if we can define a renormalized symplectic structure \u03c9 ren by adding an exact form dB to \u03c9 which removes\nboth the outward flux and the divergence on generic hypersurfaces \u03a3. Because any\n\u03b4g in our phase space is generated by diffeomorphisms, it is clear on general principles that this is possible. Since \u03c9[g; \u03b4g, \u00a3\u03b6 g] = dk\u03b6 [\u03b4g], it would be legitimate in our\ncase to take \u03c9 ren = \u03c9 \u2212 dB = 0 identically. However, the resulting theory would\nbe trivial. In particular, one would lose all of the results from [4] concerning the\nasymptotic symmetry group and the central charge.\nWe would like to preserve such results. To do so, it is useful to note that the\nactual computations in [4]R were performed\non hypersurfaces \u03a3 of constant t. As a\nR\nresult, they involve only \u03a3 \u03c9 = \u2202\u03a3 k, and one sees that we will obtain the same\nresult for any \u03c9 ren = dkren so long as integrals of k and kren over \u2202\u03a3 agree. While\n\u2202\u03a3 consists of two pieces, recall that we consider only vectors fields \u03b6 which are\ntrivial at r \u2192 \u2212\u221e so that this boundary will not contribute to the k integral and\nthe same will be true for our kren .\nWith this in mind, we note that the spacetime is foliated by (topological) 22\n2\nspheres Sr,t\non which r, t are constant and define \u2202\u03a3 as limr\u2192\u221e Sr,t\n. We also note\nthat the above-mentioned results from [4] depend only on the pull back \u03bb = \u03bbdx\u2227d\u03c6\n2\n2\nof k to Sr,t\n. Here we have used x = cos \u03b8 and \u03c6 as coordinates on Sr,t\n. We therefore\nren\nchoose k\nto be essentially the lift of \u03bb back to the NHEK geometry defined by\nthe coordinate system (t, r, x, \u03c6). Furthermore, the subleading pieces \u03c7sub in (3.18)\nshould not contribute, as they have zero norm with respect to \u03c9 on constant t\n3\n\nSee [26] for a discussion of anti-de Sitter boundary conditions with similar properties. In that\ncase they correspond explicitly to non-local deformations of the dual field theory.\n\n9\n\n\fsurfaces.

Note that kren\n\u03b61 [\u00a3\u03b62 g] and thus \u03c9 ren [\u00a3\u03b61 g, \u00a3\u03b62 g] are manifestly antisymmetric\nin \u03b61 , \u03b62 . For simplicity, we follow [4] in restricting attention to the symplectic structure and charges about the background g = \u1e21. However, because our entire phase\nspace is generated from \u1e21 by acting with diffeormophisms, we expect an appropriate\nnotion of diffeomorphism covariance to define a unique extension of (3.24, 3.25) to\ngeneral g 6= \u1e21.\nFor a number of reasons, our construction of B is not covariant in the bulk.\nHowever, it may be thought of as becoming covariant \"at the boundary\" where\nr has a distinguished role as the coordinate orthogonal to the boundary, t has a\ndistinguished role through the fact that \u2202t commutes with the Virasoro generators,\nand where \u03c7sub is in some sense trivial. This is consistent with interpreting our B as\narising from covariant counter-terms in an action: such counter-terms would define\nB only at the boundary and leave the extension to the bulk arbitrary.\n2\nNow, by construction, the integrals of k and kren agree over each Sr,t\n. However,\nbecause every object that defines \u03bb is independent of t, the pull-back of \u03c9 ren = dkren\nto r = constant surfaces vanishes, so that the flux F ren of \u03c9 ren through the boundary\nvanishes identically.\n\n4\n\nCharges and a stress tensor\n\nHaving found a counter-term that leads to a truly covariant phase space in section\n3, we are now in a position to construct a (canonical) boundary stress tensor. We\nbegin by reviewing the connection between the symplectic structure and the various\nconserved charges that the boundary stress tensor should compute.\nThe fundamental property of the symplectic structure is that it is the \"inverse\"\nof the Poisson structure on the algebra of observables. By this one means that the\nvariation \u03b4A of any observable A under a general variation \u03b4g of the solution (within\nthe chosen phase space) must be of the form\n\u03b4A = \u03a9(\u03b4g, \u03b4A g),\n10\n\n(4.26)\n\n\fwhere \u03b4A g is some tangent vector field on the space of solutions; i.e., it is a solution to\nthe linearized equations of motion about g for each g that extends to one-parameter\nfamily of solutions. Here we assume that \u03a9 is conserved, so that no subscript \u03a3 is\nnecessary. The Poisson Bracket of two such observables is then\n[A, B] = \u03b4A B;\n\n(4.27)\n\ni.e., the derivative of B along the specified vector field \u03b4A g.\nThis fact has two important implications for our purposes below. First, equations\n(4.26) and (4.27) imply that generators of symmetries must satisfy certain differential\nequations on the space of solutions. In particular, any charge Q\u03be which generates\nmotion along some vector field \u03be by definition satisfies [Q\u03be , B] = \u00a3\u03be B, where \u00a3\u03be is\nthe Lie derivative along \u03be. As a result, the first variation \u03b4Q\u03be [g; \u03b4g] of Q\u03be along some\ntangent vector \u03b4g at g must satisfy\n\u03b4Q\u03be [g; \u03b4g] = \u03a9(\u03b4g, \u00a3\u03be g).\n\n(4.28)\n\nSecond, note that any degeneracy in \u03a9 leads to an ambiguity in \u03b4A g. Suppose for\nexample that \u03b40 g is a vector field for which \u03a9(\u03b40 g, \u03b4g) = 0 for all \u03b4g tangent to the\ngiven phase space. Then we have \u03b4A = \u03a9(\u03b4A g +\u03b40 g, \u03b4g) whenever \u03b4A g satisfies (4.26).\nAs a result, (4.27) is well-defined only if \u03b40 B = 0 for all observables B. In other\nwords, we must regard \u03b40 g as a gauge transformation under which all observables\nmust be invariant. This notion of gauge transformation coincides with the expected\nresults for familiar examples and is closely connected to ambiguities in solving the\nequations of motion. In particular, conservation of \u03a9 implies that any linearized\nsolution \u03b40 g which vanishes in an open neighborhood of some complete hypersurface\n\u03a3 is a degenerate direction of this sort4 .\nIn practice, precisely which transformations are gauge symmetries can depend\nstrongly on the choice of boundary conditions. For example, in generally covariant\ntheories \u03c9 becomes and exact form when \u03b42 g = \u00a3\u03be g for any smooth vector field \u03be. As\na result, \u03a9(\u03b4g, \u00a3\u03be g) can be reduced to a boundary integral. It follows immediately\nthat any compactly-supported diffeomorphism is a gauge symmetry, though more\nanalysis is required for diffeomorphisms which act non-trivially near the boundary.\nWhen the result does not vanish, \u03be is said to generate a non-trivial asymptotic\nsymmetry of the system. Using the results of [22, 23], the explicit form of such\nboundary integrals for vector fields \u03b6 of the form (3.18) was computed in [4]. The\nresults depend only on \u01eb(\u03c6), so that any \u03b6 with \u01eb = 0 is pure gauge, at least around\nthe background \u1e21.\n4\n\nIt is for this reason that, as mentioned in section 3, the right-moving charges of [24, 25] should\nvanish.\n\n11\n\n\fMoreover, any solution g continuously connected to \u1e21 can be obtained by exponentiating the action of the vector fields (3.18) on \u1e21; i.e., by a finite diffeomorphism\ngenerated by a vector field \u03b6 of the form (3.18). Since all \u03be\u01eb commute with \u03b7 and \u2202t ,\nthese finite diffeomorphisms map \u03b7, \u2202t to vector fields of the form \u03b7 + \u03c7sub , \u2202t + \u03c7sub ,\nwhich define degenerate directions of \u03c9 at \u1e21. But the symplectic structure is covariant, so that \u00a3\u03b7 g, \u00a3\u2202t g must be degenerate directions of \u03c9 at any such g. At\nleast under the assumption that the solution space is connected, it follows that any\nvector field asymptotic to \u03b7 or \u2202t generates a gauge transformation. In particular,\nwe see that time-translations are pure gauge. While we shall not make further use of\nthis observation here, one wonders whether it will have further implications for the\nKerr/CFT correspondence.\nCombining (4.28) and the fact that \u03c9 ren = dkren yields\nZ\n\u03b4Q\u03be [g] =\nkren\n(4.29)\n\u03be [\u03b4g, g] ,\n\u2202\u03a3\n\nwhere kren\n\u03be [\u03b4g, g] = k\u03be [\u03b4g, g]\u2212B[g, \u03b4g, \u00a3\u03be g]. Finite charge differences can be obtained\nby integrating \u03b4Q over a path in the space of metrics. The finite charge will be\nindependent of this path if a certain integrability condition is satisfied:\nZ\nK\u03be [g, h1 , h2 ] = 0 ,\n(4.30)\n\u2202\u03a3\n\nwhere\nren\nren\nK\u03be [g, h1 , h2 ] = kren\n\u03be [h1 , g + h2 ] \u2212 k\u03be [h2 , g + h1 ] \u2212 k\u03be [h1 \u2212 h2 , g] .\n\n(4.31)\n\nThis integrability condition can equivalently be expressed [21] in terms of the\nsymplectic current as\nZ\n\u03b6 * \u03c9 ren [g; \u03b41g, \u03b42 g] = 0 ,\n(4.32)\n\u2202\u03a3\n\na\n\nwhere (\u03b6 * \u03c9)bc = \u03b6 \u03c9abc . Now, by construction \u03c9 ren does not depend on the subleading parts of \u03b6. This means that kren is independent of t and \u03c9 ren \u223c \u2202r \u03bbdr \u2227 dx \u2227 d\u03c6,\nwhere the \u223c denotes equality up to the anti-symmetrization in (3.24). Furthermore,\nsince we consider normalizeable modes it is clear that \u2202r \u03bb \u2192 0. It turns out that\n\u03bb \u223c const + O(r \u22122 ) at each (\u03b8, \u03c6). However, the convergence is not uniform due to\nthe formation of a tall, thin spike near each pole. These spikes arise from the fact\nthat as r becomes large, the regulated vector fields (3.22) develop large derivatives\nnear the poles. However, a careful analysis shows that the integral over each spike\n12\n\n\fremains small in the large r limit. We find that (4.32) is satisfied (for g = \u1e21) so long\nas\n\u03b6 r = r\u03b1\n(4.33)\nwhere \u03b1 is a smooth bounded function for large r. This particular condition turns\nout to depend on the choice of \u03b8-dependence used in (3.22) to make the Virasoro\ngenerators well-behaved at the poles of the sphere. Other regulators give similar\nresults, but for slightly different classes of allowed \u03c7sub . In this sense our regularized symplectic structure depends somewhat on the choice of regulator, though all\nregulators appear to give the same central charge. A related feature of the original\nsymplectic structure \u03c9 is discussed below.\nWe note that the condition (4.33) is satisfied by the regulated Virasoro generators\n(3.22), and also by any repeated commutator of these fields. However, it is not\nnecessarily satisfied by all vector fields that are formally of the form (3.18) if the\nterms represented by (. . .) are understood to be subleading only pointwise on each\n2\nSr,t\n(and not in some more uniform sense). It appears that only vector fields satisfying\nboth (3.22) and (4.33) should be regarded as pure gauge.\nIt turns out, however, that (4.32) does not vanish for the original symplectic\nstructure (3.15), even when \u03a3 is a constant time surface. The issue is again a tall,\nthin spike near the pole similar to the one above, but which now turns out to be\nsomewhat larger. The difference is due to the dx \u2227 dr and dr \u2227 d\u03c6 terms in k which\nwere removed in defining \u03c9 ren . The details of the spike depend on the regulator,\nbut we find a non-zero result for a broad class of regulators that includes the one\nsuggested in footnote 6 of [4]. As a result, despite the results in their appendix B, we\nfind that the charges are not integrable without the addition of our counter-terms.\nWe also find a non-zero result for the difference of two regulated Virasoro generators\ncorresponding to the same Virasoro element, but having different regulators; e.g., for\n\u0013\n\u0012 2 2\n4\n2\nr\nsin\n\u03b8\nr\nsin\n\u03b8\n\u2212\n(\u01eb(\u03c6)\u2202\u03c6 \u2212 r\u01eb\u2032 (\u03c6)\u2202r ) .\n(4.34)\n\u03be \u0303\u01eb =\n2\n4\n2\n2\n1 + r sin \u03b8 1 + r sin \u03b8\nAs a result, one sees that different choices of regulator are not gauge equivalent with\nrespect to the original symplectic structure \u03c9.\nHaving shown that the charges defined by \u03c9 ren are integrable, we would now\nlike to construct a conserved stress tensor that yields these charges. The idea is to\nconstruct conserved currents in t, \u03c6 space\nZ 1\n(j\u03b62 )i =\n(k\u0303\u03b6ren\n)ix dx|r\u2192\u221e for i, j, . . . = t, \u03c6,\n(4.35)\n2\n\u22121\n\n13\n\n\fwhich are related to the associated two-dimensional stress-energy tensor by\n(j\u03b62 )i = Tij [\u03b61 ]\u03b62 j .\n\n(4.36)\n\nHere k\u0303ren = kren + dA for some smooth A, so that k\u0303ren and kren define identical\ncharges. The trick is to choose A so that (4.36) is satisfied; i.e., so that (4.35) can be\nexpressed linearly in terms of \u03b62 without taking derivatives. An appropriate choice\nturns out to be\nA\u03b62 [\u1e21; \u00a3\u03b61 \u1e21] = \u2212\n\n3R(r)\n(1 \u2212 x2 ) (\u01eb1 \u01eb\u2032\u20322 \u2212 4\u01eb1 \u01eb2 \u2212 2\u01eb\u20321 \u01eb\u20322 + 3\u01eb\u2032\u20321 \u01eb2 ) dx .\n64\u03c0\n\n(4.37)\n\nThe x-dependence is largely arbitrary, though it must have the correct integral over\n\u03b8 \u2208 [0, \u03c0] and should vanish rapidly enough at the poles to make dA continuous.\nFrom (4.35) one finds that only j\u03c6 is non-zero, and the only non-zero component\nof the stress tensor is\nJ\nT\u03c6\u03c6 [\u03b61 ] =\n(2\u01eb\u20321 \u2212 \u01eb\u2032\u2032\u2032\n(4.38)\n1 ) ,\n2\u03c0\nwhere we have restored factors previously set to one. Note that, strictly speaking,\nwe have computed the variation of the stress tensor for small fluctuations about the\nbackground \u1e21 since k\u0303ren computes the linearized charges about g. To be precise, our\nTij [\u03b6] should be related to the full boundary stress tensor Tij (g) for a solution g by\nT\u03c6\u03c6 [\u03b61 ] = \u2202\u03bb [T\u03c6\u03c6 (\u1e21 + \u03bb\u00a3\u03b61 \u1e21)]|\u03bb=0 .\n\n5\n\nDiscussion\n\nWe showed above that the symplectic structure \u03a9\u03a3 used in [4] is finite and conserved\nonly when evaluated on surfaces \u03a3 on which t becomes asymptotically constant. As\na result, the phase space resulting from this symplectic structure is not covariant.\nWere this the end of the story, it would suggest that any dual theory is defined only\non t = constant surfaces and, as a result, that it is highly non-local. A related issue\nwas a subtle failure of integrability for the charges defined in [4], even on constant t\nhypersurfaces. As a result, the Virasoro generators were ill-defined at the non-linear\nlevel.\nHowever, we found that both issues could be resolved by adding an appropriate\nlocal counter-term B to obtain a renormalized symplectic structure \u03c9 ren = \u03c9 \u2212 dB.\nSince counter-terms in the symplectic structure result from counter-terms in the\naction needed to obtain a good variational principle [8], our work may be considered\na first step toward constructing a so-called holographically renormalized action for\nNHEK asymptotics.\n14\n\n\fOur counter-term is not covariant in the bulk as it required a choice of spheres\nand a volume form dx \u2227 d\u03c6 on each sphere. However, it becomes covariant on the\nboundary if this boundary is defined as the limit of constant r surfaces. The point is\n2\nthat the spheres St,r\nand the associated volume form are uniquely-defined in the limit\nof large r under the GHSS fall-off conditions. This is consistent with interpreting\nour B as arising from counter-terms in a covariant action: such counter-terms would\ndefine B only at the boundary and leave the extension to the bulk arbitrary. If such\nboundary terms can be found, they would provide a more elegant definition of \u03c9 ren .\nOur renormalized symplectic structure \u03c9 ren was explicitly constructed to give the\nsame symplectic products as that of [4] when evaluated on constant t hypersurfaces.\nAs a result, it defines both the asymptotic symmetry algebra and central charge\nreported in [4], in terms of which the Kerr black hole entropy can be expressed via\nCardy's formula. However, the theory is now covariant, so that the same results are\nobtained on any hypersurface \u03a3. In addition, the charges are now integrable and\ntherefore exist at a non-linear level5 .\nWe then used \u03c9 ren to construct a differential boundary stress tensor Tij , where\ni, j run only over t, \u03c6. Only the component T\u03c6\u03c6 was non-zero, and the result was\ntime-independent. The vanishing of the time components Ttj was associated with\nthe fact that time-translations are pure gauge.\nNote that the trace of Tij should vanish in any conformal field theory. In particular, since we computed the difference between the stress tensors of nearby states, any\ntrace anomaly will cancel. It is interesting to ask what metrics \u03b3ij in the dual theory\ncould make Tij both traceless and conserved. Due to the symmetries of the NHEK\ngeometry, we assume \u03b3ij is to be independent of t, \u03c6. The necessary and sufficient\ncondition is then simply \u03b3 \u03c6\u03c6 = 0. Since any such metric has \u03b3tt = 0, we see that the\ngauge direction \u2202t should be a null direction in the dual theory.\nIt is useful to write the stress tensor in terms of null coordinates x\u00b1 with respect\nto \u03b3ij . One may set x\u2212 = \u03c6 (so that dx\u2212 is null) and take x+ to be an appropriate\nlinear combination of t and \u03c6 (so that dx+ is null). Note that since (\u2202t )i Tij = 0, one\nfinds T+j = 0; i.e., the only non-zero component is T\u2212\u2212 . Said another way, in the dual\ntheory one can think of the Virasoro algebra as generating diffeomorphisms along\nthe null direction \u2202x\u2202\u2212 , though the theory is chiral in the usual sense that generators\nalong \u2202t \u221d \u2202x\u2202+ vanish.\nSince x\u2212 = \u03c6 is periodic, the dual theory lives on a null cylinder and describes a\ndiscrete light cone quantum theory as suggested by the arguments of [6]. However,\n2\nSt,r\n\n5\n\nIt may also be possible to construct integrable charges using the original symplectic structure\nby modifying the definition of the generators for g 6= \u1e21. See [27] for an example of this sort.\nHowever, such an approach cannot resolve the hypersurface dependence issue.\n\n15\n\n\fthere are also important differences between the proposed Kerr/CFT correspondence\nof [4] and the picture described in [6] for extreme BTZ black holes. Chief among\nthese is that [4] found a central charge that depends on J while the temperature is a\nconstant T = 1/2\u03c0. In contrast, for the BTZ case the central charge is independent\nof J, so that all values of J can be described by the same discrete light cone quantum\ntheory.\nNow the reader may recall that, assuming as above that the arguments of [17, 18]\nare correct and that the only solutions compatible with GHSS fall-off are diffeomorphic to the NHEK spacetime, the original NHEK symplectic structure \u03c9 is an exact\nform dk on the phase space. As a result, one can imagine adding boundary terms that\nwould significantly change the results reported in [4]. Indeed, at the level that we\nhave studied the problem in this work, one may simply define kren\n\u03be1 [g, \u00a3\u03be2 g] = f dx\u2227d\u03c6\nfor any appropriately anti-symmetric smooth function f [g, \u03be1, \u03be2 ], where g is thought\nof as an element of the Virasoro group and \u03be1 , \u03be2 are tangent vectors at g. In particular, one could choose kren to be independent of J, in closer analogy with [6].\nHowever, we see no particularly natural constructions of this type and, in any case,\nwithout compensating changes in the Virasoro charge L0 , the predictions of Cardy's\nformula would no longer agree with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy SBH \u223c J of the\nKerr black hole.\nAs is clear from the paragraph above, the current level of discussion leaves great\nambiguity in the choice of symplectic structure, and thus in the physical results.\nOur choice (3.24) has desirable features in that it resolves the above-mentioned integrability and covariance issues while retaining the main results from [4]. However,\nwe gave no first-principles argument that would distinguish (3.24) from any other\nchoice. It would be much more satisfying if (3.24) could be derived from a local\ncovariant variational principle with boundary terms, which would then constitute\na holographically renormalized action for Kerr/CFT. One would hope that such a\nframework would both restrict the possible choices of symplectic structure and help\nto interpret the ambiguities that remain.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors are grateful to Geoffrey Comp\u00e8re for many useful discussions during\nthis work, as well as for sharing his Mathematica code.
