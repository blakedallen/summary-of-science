Just what, exactly, gives mass to the\nweak gauge bosons and the known fermions? Is it weakly-coupled and spontaneous, involving\nfundamental scalars, or strongly-coupled, involving composite scalars? Is the flavor problem\nlinked? Do we discover the physics behind dark matter (and its mass), gauge unification\nand flavor at the same time? Or are those disconnected problems?\nOur starting point is unitarity, the conservation of probability: the weak interaction of\nthe Standard Model (SM) of particle physics violates it at about 1 TeV [1]. The theory\ndemands at least one new propagating scalar state with gauge coupling to weak bosons to\nkeep this under control. The same problem holds for fermion\u2013boson interactions [2, 3, 4, 5],\nonly at much higher energy, so is generally less often discussed1 . While the variety of\nexplanations for electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) is vast, what we call the Standard\nModel (SM) assumes the existence of a single fundamental scalar field which spontaneously\nacquires a vacuum expectation value to generate all fermion and boson masses. It is a\nremarkably compact and elegant explanation, simple in the extreme. Yet while it tidies up\nthe immediate necessities of the SM, it suffers from glaring theoretical pathologies that drive\nmuch of the model-building behind more ambitious explanations.\nNumerous lectures and review articles already exist, covering the SM Higgs sector and the\nminimal supersymmetric (MSSM) extension [6, 7, 8, 9], which are useful both for learning\nnitty-gritty theoretical details and serving as formulae references. These lectures are instead\na crash-course tour of theory in practical application: previous, present and planned Higgs\nsearches, what happens after a candidate Higgs discovery, and an overview of MSSM Higgs\nphenomenology as a perturbation of that for SM Higgs. They are not comprehensive, but do\nprovide a solid grounding in the basics of Higgs hunting. They should be read only after one\nhas become intimate with the SM Higgs sector and its underlying theoretical issues. Within\nTASI 2006, this means you should already have studied Sally Dawson's lectures. After both\nof these you should also be able to explain to your friends how we look for a Higgs boson at\ncolliders (if they care), how to confirm it's a Higgs and figure out what variety it is (since we\ncare), and describe how some basic extensions to the SM Higgs sector behave as a function\nof their parameter space (nature might not care for the SM).\nHerein I'll assume that nature prefers fundamental scalars and spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking. This is a strong bias, but one that provides a solid framework for phenomenology.\nThe ambitious student who wants to really learn all the varieties of EWSB should also\nstudy strong dynamics [16], dimensional deconstruction [17], extra-dimensional Higgsless\nconstructions [18] and the Little Higgs [19] and Twin Higgs mechanisms [20]. In many of\nthese classes of theories the Higgs sector appears to be very SM-like, but in some no Higgs\nappears and one instead would pay great attention to weak boson scattering around a TeV.\n1\n\nThe original study [2] was clearly incorrect, but the correct line of reasoning is a work in progress [3, 4, 5].\n\n3\n\n\fII.\n\nCOLLIDER SEARCHES FOR THE STANDARD MODEL HIGGS\n\nEven though the SM Higgs sector doesn't explain flavor (why all the fermion masses\nare scattered about over 12 orders of magnitude in energy) and has a disconcerting radiative stability problem that surely must involve new physics beyond the SM, it's a suitable\njumping-off point for formulating Higgs phenomenology. That is, the study of physical phenomena associated with a theory, exploring the connection between theory and experiment.\nWithout this connection, experiments would not make sense and theory would flail about,\nuntested. To survey SM Higgs collider physics we need to recall a few fundamentals about\nthe SM Higgs boson.\n1. The Higgs boson unitarizes weak boson scattering, V V \u2192 V V , so its interaction with\nweak bosons is very strictly defined to be the electroweak gauge coupling times the\nvacuum expectation value (vev); i.e., proportional to the weak boson masses.\n2. The Higgs also unitarizes V V \u2192 f f \u0304 scattering, so its fermion couplings (except \u03bdi )\nare proportional to the fermion mass, with a strictly defined universal coefficient.\n3. Because of the coupling strengths, the Higgs is dominantly produced by or in association with massive particles (including loop-induced processes, as we'll see in\nSec. II A 1), and prefers to decay to the most massive particles kinematically allowed.\n4. The Higgs boson mass itself is a free parameter2 , but influences EW observables, so\nwe can fit EW precision data to make a prediction for its mass.\nWe may thus define the SM Higgs sector by its vacuum expectation value, v, measured via\nMW , GF , etc., and the known electroweak gauge couplings; 9 Yukawa couplings (fermion\nmass parameters, ignoring neutrinos and CKM mixing angles); and one free parameter, MH .\nPrior to the Large Electron Positron (LEP) collider era starting around 1990, Higgs\nsearches involved looking for resonances amongst the low energy hadronic spectra in e+ e\u2212\ncollisions. These were in fact non-trivial searches, mostly involving decays of hadrons to\nHiggs plus a photon, but are generally regarded as comprehensive and set a lower mass\nbound of MH & 3 GeV.\nHiggs hunting in the 1990s was owned by LEP, an e+ e\u2212 collider at CERN which steadily\nmarched up in energy over the decade. It found no Higgs bosons3 . Attention then turned to\nthe long-delayed Tevatron Run II program, proton\u2013antiproton collisions at 2 TeV, which got\noff to a shaky start but is now performing splendidly. It so far sees nothing Higgs-like, either,\nbut has not yet gathered enough data to be able to say much. The proton\u2013proton Large\nHadron Collider (LHC) at CERN is also many years behind schedule, but its construction\nis now nearing completion and we may expect physics data within a few years.\nOur survey begins with LEP from a historical perspective and some general statements\nabout Higgs boson behavior as a function of its mass. Next we turn our attention to the\nongoing Tev2 search, for which the prospects hinge critically on machine performance. Then\nwe delve into the intricacies of LHC Higgs pheno, which is far more complicated than either\nLEP or Tevatron, yet essentially guarantees an answer to our burning questions.\n2\n3\n\nWe know it is not massless, due to the absence of additional long-range forces.\nThis may be a somewhat controversial statement, depending on what lunch table you're sitting at. See\nSec. II A 3.\n\n4\n\n\fA.\n\nThe LEP Higgs search\n\nAn obvious question to ask is, can we produce the Higgs directly in e+ e\u2212 collisions?\nWe could then probe Higgs masses up to our machine energy, which for LEP-II eventually\nreached 209 GeV. Recalling that the Higgs\u2013electron coupling is proportional to the electron\nmass, which is quite a bit smaller than the electroweak vev of 246 GeV, the coupling strength\nis about 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22126 , or teeny-tiny in technical parlance. A quick calculation reveals that it\nwould take about 4 years running full-tilt to produce just one Higgs boson. This one event\nwould have to be distinguished from the general scattering cross section to fermion pairs in\nthe SM, which is beyond hopeless.\nInstead, we think of what process involves something massive, with vastly larger Higgs\ncoupling, so that the interaction rate is large enough to produce a statistically useful number\nof Higgs bosons. The two obvious possibilities are e+ e\u2212 \u2192 W + W \u2212 H (two W 's required for\ncharge conservation) and e+ e\u2212 \u2192 ZH. The first process will obviously have less reach in\nMH as the two W bosons require far more energy than a single Z boson to produce. LEP\nHiggs searches therefore focused on the latter process, shown as a Feynman diagram in\nFig. 1: the electron and positron annihilate to form a virtual Z, far above its mass shell,\nwhich returns on-shell by spitting off a Higgs boson. This process is generically known as\nHiggsstrahlung, analogous to bremsstrahlung radiation. Both the Higgs and Z immediately\ndecay to an asymptotic final state of SM particles. For the Higgs this is preferentially to\nthe most massive kinematically-allowed pair, while Z decays are governed by the fermion\ngauge couplings4 . In brief, the Z decays 70% of the time to jets, 20% of the time invisibly\n(to neutrinos, which the detectors can't see), and about 10% to charged leptons, which are\nthe most distinctive, \"clean\" objects in a detector.\n\ne\n\nf\n\n@@\nH0\nR@\n\u0003\nZ\n@\n@_\nu ^_^_^_u\b\n\n\b\nZ\n\ne+\n\n\b\n\n\u0012\n@\n@\nf@\n\n\b f0\n\b\u0012\n\n@@\nf 0@\n\nFIG. 1: Feynman diagram for the process e+ e\u2212 \u2192 ZH with subsequent Higgs and Z boson decays\nto fermion pairs. All LEP Higgs searches were based primarily on this process, with various fermion\ncombinations in the final state composing the different search channels.\n\n1.\n\nMomentary diversion: Higgs decays\n\nWhat, precisely, are the Higgs branching ratios (BRs)? To find these, we first need the\nHiggs partial widths; that is, the inverse decay rates to each final state kinematically allowed.\nEveryone should calculate these once as an exercise.\n4\n\nSee the PDG [21] for Z boson branching ratios, which you should memorize.\n\n5\n\n\fLet's start with the easiest case: Higgs decay to fermion pairs, which is a very simple\nmatrix element. The general result at tree-level is:\ns\n4m2f\nNc GF m2f MH 3\n\u221a\n\u0393f f \u0304 =\n(1)\n\u03b2\nwhere \u03b2 = 1 \u2212 2\nMH\n4 2\u03c0\nOne factor of the fermion velocity \u03b2 comes from the matrix element and two factors come\nfrom the phase space. I emphasize that this is at tree-level because there are significant\nQCD corrections to colored fermions. The bulk of these corrections are absorbed into a\nrunning mass (see Ref. [8]). For calculations we should always use mq (MH ), the quark\nmass renormalized to the Higgs mass scale, rather than the quark pole mass. Programs\nsuch as hdecay [22] will calculate these automatically given SM parameter inputs, greatly\nsimplifying practical phenomenology.\nNote that the partial width to fermions is linear in MH , modulo the cubic fermion velocity\ndependence, which steepens the ascent with MH near threshold. Partial widths for various\nHiggs decays are shown in Fig. 2. While the total Higgs width above fermion thresholds\ngrows with Higgs mass, Higgs total widths below W pair threshold are on the order of tens\nof MeV \u2013 quite narrow. The only complicated partial width to fermions is that for top\nquarks, for which we must treat the fermions as virtual (at least near threshold) and use\nthe matrix elements to the full six-fermion final state, integrated over phase space. This is\nslightly more complicated, but easily performed numerically.\nBefore the decay to top quarks is kinematically allowed, however, the decays to weak\nbosons turn on. A few W /Z widths above threshold the W and Z may be treated as\non-shell asymptotic final states, making the partial width calculation easier. We find:\n\uf8f1\n= 2, 1\n\uf8f4\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\uf8f2\u03b4W,Z \u221a\nGF MH3\n3 2\n\u221a\n\u0393V V =\n\u03b4V \u03b2 1 \u2212 xV + xV where \u03b2 = 1 \u2212 xV\n(2)\n\uf8f4\n4\n16 2\u03c0\n\uf8f3x = 4MV2\nV\nM2\nH\n\nThe factor of \u03b2 comes from phase space, while the matrix elements give the more complicated\nfunction of xV . The partial width is dominantly cubic in MH , although the factors of beta\nand xV enhance this somewhat near threshold, as in the fermion case. We can see this in\nFig. 2: the partial widths to V V gradually flatten out to cubic behavior above threshold. The\nreason for this stronger MH dependence compared to fermions is that a longitudinal massive\nboson wavefunction is proportional to its energy in the high-energy limit, which enhances\nthe coupling by a factor E/MV . (Recall that it is this property of massive gauge bosons that\nrequires the Higgs, lest their scattering amplitude rise as E 2 /MV2 , violating unitarity. The\nHiggs in fact generates the longitudinal modes.) This much stronger dependence on MH leads\nto a very rapid total width growth with MH , which reaches 1 GeV around MH = 190 GeV.\nWe'll return to this when discussing Higgs couplings measurements in Sec. III C. The bottom\nline is that bosons \"win\" compared to fermions. Thus, even though the top quark has a\nlarger mass than W or Z, it cannot compete for partial width and thus BR. Note that\nthe partial widths to V V are non-trivial below threshold: the W and Z are unstable and\ntherefore have finite widths; they may be produced off-shell. The Higgs can decay to these\nvirtual states because its coupling is proportional to the daughter pole masses (or, in the\ncase of quarks, the running masses), not the virtual q 2 , which can be much smaller. Below\nthreshold the analytical expressions are known [23] (see Ref. [7] for a summary), but are not\nparticularly insightful to derive as an exercise.\n6\n\n\fFIG. 2: Select Standard Model Higgs boson partial widths, as a function of mass, MH . Individual\npartial widths are labeled, while the total width (sum of all partial widths, some minor ones not\nshown) is the black curve. Widths calculated with hdecay [22].\n\nThe astute reader will have noticed by now that Fig. 2 contains curves for Higgs partial\nwidths to massless final states! (Have another look if you didn't notice.) We know the\nHiggs couples to particles proportional to their masses, so this requires some explanation.\nRecall that loop-induced transitions can occur at higher orders in perturbation theory. Such\ninteractions typically are important to calculate only when a tree-level interaction doesn't\nexist. They are responsible for rare decays of various mesons, for instance, and are in some\ncases sensitive to new physics which may appear in the loop. Here, we consider only SM\nparticles in the loop. Which ones are important? Recall also once again that the Higgs\nboson couples proportional to particle mass. Thus, the top quark and EW gauge bosons are\nmost important. For H \u2192 gg, then, that means only the top quark, while for H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 it is\nboth the top quark and W loops (there is no ZZ\u03b3 vertex).

All quarks enter the\nloop, but contribute according to their Yukawa coupling squared (mass squared). In the SM, only\nthe top quark is important.\n\nwhich is for a general quark in the loop with SM Yukawa coupling. It's easy to see that\nin the SM the b quark contribution, which is second in size to that of the top quark, is\ninconsequential. Remember to use the running mass mf (MH ) to take into account the\nlargest QCD effects. When you derive this expression yourself as an exercise, take care\nto solve the loop integral in d > 4 dimensions, otherwise you miss a finite piece. The\nH \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3, Z\u03b3 expressions have a similar form [25], but with two loop functions, since it can\nalso be mediated a W boson loop (which interferes destructively with the top quark loop!):\n\u0393\u03b3\u03b3 =\n\n\u03b12 GF MH3 X\n\u221a\nNc,i Q2i Fi\n3\n128 2 \u03c0\ni\n\n2\n\nF1 = 2 + 3\u03c4 [1 + (2 \u2212 \u03c4 )f (\u03c4 )] , F1/2 = \u22122\u03c4 [1 + (1 \u2212 \u03c4 )f (\u03c4 )] , F0 = \u03c4 [1 \u2212 \u03c4 f (\u03c4 )]\n\n(5)\n(6)\n\nwhere Nc,i is the number of colors, Qi the charge, and Fj the particle's spin.\nNow look again more closely at Fig. 2. The important feature to notice is that these\nloop-induced partial widths are ostensibly proportional to MH3 , like the decays to gauge\nbosons. However, the contents of the brackets, specifically the f (\u03c4i ) function, can alter this\nin non-obvious ways. For H \u2192 gg, Fig. 2 shows a slightly more than cubic dependence at\nlow masses, leveling of to approximately MH3 , and flattening out to approximately quadratic\na bit above the top quark pair threshold. We see from Eq. 3 that the functional form changes\nat that threshold, albeit fairly smoothly, by picking up a constant imaginary piece when the\ntop quarks in the loop can be on-shell.\nThe partial widths to \u03b3\u03b3 and Z\u03b3 behave very differently than gg. For MH below W pair\nthreshold, the interference between top quark and W loops produces an extremely sharp\nrise with MH , which transitions to something slightly more than linear in MH at W pair\nthreshold where the W bosons in the loop go on-shell. There is is a smoother transition at\nthe top quark pair threshold, where they can similarly go on-shell. The \u03b3\u03b3 and Z\u03b3 partial\nwidths behave differently because of the different tt\u0304\u03b3 and tt\u0304Z couplings: the partial width\nto Z\u03b3 at large MH is almost a constant, but falls off for \u03b3\u03b3 almost inverse cubic in MH .\nOnce we've calculated all the various possible partial widths, we sum them up to find\nthe Higgs total width. Each BR is then simply the ratio \u0393i /\u0393tot . These are shown in Fig. 4;\nnote the log scale. If it wasn't obvious from the partial width discussion, it should be now:\nnear thresholds, properly including finite width effects can be very important to get the\nBRs correct. Observe how the BR to W W \u2217 (at least one W is necessarily off-shell) is 50%\nat MH = 140 GeV, 20 GeV below W pair threshold. BR(H \u2192 bb\u0304)\u223cBR(H \u2192 W + W \u2212 ) at\nMH = 136 GeV.\n8\n\n\fFIG. 4: Select Standard Model Higgs boson branching ratios as a function of mass, MH [22]. The\nHiggs prefers to decay to the most massive possible final state. The ratio of fermionic branching\nratios are proportional to fermion masses squared, modulo color factors and radiative corrections.\n2.\n\nA brief word on statistics \u2013 the simple view\n\nNow that we understand the basics of Higgs decay, and production in electron-positron\ncollisions, we should take a moment to consider statistics. The reason we must resort to\nstatistics is that particle detectors are imperfect instruments. It is impossible to precisely\nmeasure the energy of all outgoing particles in every collision. The calorimeters are sampling\ndevices, which means they don't capture all the energy; rather they're calibrated to give\nan accurate central value at large statistics, with some Gaussian uncertainty about the\nmean for any single event. Excess energy can also appear, due to cosmic rays, beam\u2013\ngas or beam secondary interactions. Quark final states hadronize, resulting in the true\nfinal state in the detector (a jet) being far more complicated and difficult even to identify\nuniquely. The electronics can suffer hiccups, and software always has bugs, leading to\nimperfect analysis. Thus, we would never see two or three events at precisely the Higgs\nmass of, say, 122.6288... GeV, and pop the champagne. Rather, we'll get a distribution of\nmasses and have to identify the central value and its associated uncertainty.\nIn any experiment, event counts are quantum rolls of the dice. For a sufficient number\n\n9\n\n\fof events, they also follow a Gaussian distribution about the true mean:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n(x \u2212 \u03bc)2\nf (x; \u03bc, \u03c3) = \u221a exp \u2212\n(7)\n2\u03c3 2\n\u03c3 2\u03c0\n\u221a\nThe statistical uncertainty in the rate then goes as 1/ N , where N is the number of events.\nThis is \"one sigma\"\n\u221a of uncertainty: 68.2% of identically-conducted experiments would obtain\nN within \u03c3 \u2248 \u00b1 N about \u03bc = Ntrue , representing the true cross section. Fig. 5 shows the\nfractional probabilities for various \"sigma\", or number of standard deviations from the true\nmean. To claim observation of a signal deviating from our expected background, we generally\nuse a 5\u03c3 criteria for discovery. This means, if systematic errors have been properly accounted\nfor, that there is only a 0.00006% chance that the signal is due to a statistical fluctuation.\nHowever, this threshold is subjective, and you will often hear colleagues take 4\u03c3 or even 3\u03c3\ndeviations seriously. Since particle physics has seen dozens of three sigma deviations come\nand go over the decades, I would encourage you to regard 3\u03c3 as \"getting interesting\", and\n4\u03c3 as \"pay close attention and ask lots of questions about systematics\".\n\nFIG. 5: Gaussian distribution about a mean \u03bc, showing the fractional probability of events within\none, two and three standard deviations of the mean.\n\nBecause SM processes can produce the same final state as any ZH combined BR, we must\nknow accurately what the background rate is for each signal channel (final state) and how\nit is distributed in invariant mass, then look for a statistically significant fluctuation from\nthe expected background over a fixed window region. The size of the window is determined\nby detector resolution: the better the detector, the narrower the window, so the smaller the\nbackground, yielding a better signal-to-background rate. Generally, the window is adjusted\nto accept one or two standard deviations of the hypothesized signal (68\u201395%).\nAnalyses are then defined by two different Gaussians: that governing how many signal\n(and background) events were produced, and that parameterizing the detector's measurement abilities. The event count N in our above expression is the actual number of events\nobserved, in an experiment. But in performing calculations ahead of time for expected signal\nand background, it is variously taken as just B, the number of background events expected,\nor S + B, expected signal included, depending on the relative sizes of S and B. For doing\nphenomenology, trying to decide which signals to study and calculate more precisely, the\ndistinction is often ignored.\n10\n\n\fThe statistical picture I've outlined here is quite simplified. Not all experiments have\nsufficient numbers of events to describe their data by Gaussians \u2013 Poisson statistics may be\nmore appropriate. (An excellent text on statistics for HEP is Ref. [26].) Not all detector\neffects are Gaussian-distributed. Nevertheless, it gets across the main point: multiple sources\nof randomness introduce a level of uncertainty that must be parameterized by statistics.\nOnly when the probability of a random background fluctuation up or down to the observed\nnumber of events is small enough, perhaps in some distribution, can signal observation be\nclaimed. Exactly where this line lies is admittedly a little hazy, but there's certainly a point\nof several sigmas at which everybody would agree.\n3.\n\nLEP Higgs data and results\n\nNow to the actual LEP search. Electrons and positrons have only electroweak interactions, so backgrounds and a potential Higgs signal are qualitatively of the same size. (We'll\nsee shortly in Sec. II B how this is not so at a hadron collider, which has colored initial\nstates.) LEP thus had the ability to examine almost all Z and H decay combinations: bb\u0304jj,\nbb\u0304l+ l\u2212 , bb\u0304\u03bd \u03bd\u0304, \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 jj, jjjj, etc. The largest of these is bb\u0304jj, as it combines the largest\nBRs of both the Z and H. It's closely followed by bb\u0304\u03bd \u03bd\u0304, since a Z will go to neutrinos 20%\nof the time. Neutrinos are missing energy, however, so not precisely measured, making it\npossible that any observed missing energy didn't in fact come from a Z. Jets are much less\nwell-measured than leptons, so a narrower mass window can be used for the Z in bb\u0304l+ l\u2212\nevents than bb\u0304jj; the smaller backgrounds in the narrower window might beat the smaller\nstatistics of the leptonic final state.\nThe exact details of each LEP search channel are not so important, as lack of observation\nmeans we're more interested in channels' signal and background attributes at hadron colliders. For these lectures I just present the final LEP result combining all four experiments.\nThe interested student should read Eilam Gross' \"Higgs Statistics for Pedestrians\", which\ngoes into much more depth, and with wonderful clarity [27].\nThe money plot is shown in Fig. 6. It shows the expected confidence level (CL) for\nthe signal+background hypothesis as a function of Higgs mass. The thin solid horizontal\nline at CL=0.05 signifies a 5% probability that a true signal together with the background\nwould have fluctuated down in number of events to not be discriminated from the expected\nbackground. The green and yellow regions are the 1\u03c3 and 2\u03c3 expected uncertainty bands\nas a function of MH , taking into account all sources of uncertainty, calculational as well as\ndetector effects. Where the central value (dashed curve) crosses 0.05 defines the 95% CL\nexpected exclusion (lower mass limit). This is essentially the available collision energy minus\nthe Z mass minus a few extra GeV to account for the Z finite width \u2013 it may be produced\nslightly off-shell with some usable rate. The solid red curve is the actual experimental result,\nwhich is slightly above the experimental result everywhere, meaning that the experiments\ngathered a couple more events than expected in the 115-116 GeV mass bin.\nThe end of LEP running involved a certain amount of histrionics. At first, the number\nof excess event at the kinematic machine limit was a few, but more careful analyses removed most of these. For example, one particularly notorious event originally included in\none experiment's analysis had more energy than the beam delivered. Another experiment\nremoved a candidate event because some of the outgoing particles traveled down a poorlyinstrumented region of the detector which was not normally used in analysis. The final,\nmost credible enumeration was one candidate event in one experiment, show in Fig. 7.\n11\n\n\fCLs\n\n1\n\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n10\n\n-1\n\nLEP\n\n-2\n-3\n\nObserved\nExpected for\nbackground\n\n-4\n-5\n\n114.4\n\n115.3\n\n-6\n\n100 102 104 106 108 110 112 114 116 118 120\n2\n\nmH(GeV/c )\nFIG. 6: Four-experiment combined result of the LEP Standard Model Higgs search.

Higgs-hunting hopes were high [29], although it was clear that\nthe machine and both detectors have to perform exceptionally well to have a chance, as\nTevatron's Higgs mass reach will not be all that great, and will have significant observability\ngaps in the mass region expected from precision EW data.\nTo understand the details and issues, we first need to identify how a Higgs boson may be\nproduced in proton-antiproton collisions. Like the electron, the light quarks have too small a\nmass (Yukawa coupling) to produce a Higgs directly with any useful rate, discernible against\nthe large QCD backgrounds produced in hadron collisions5 . Quarks may annihilate, however,\nto EW gauge bosons, which have large coupling to the Higgs; and likewise to a top quark\npair. Incoming quarks may also emit a pair of gauge bosons which fuse to form a Higgs, a\nprocess known as weak boson fusion (WBF). But high energy protons also possess a large\ngluon content; recall that gluons have a loop-induced coupling to the Higgs. Fig. 8 displays\nFeynman diagrams for all four of these processes at hadron colliders. The questions are, what\nare their relative sizes, and what are their backgrounds? Because of the partonic nature of\nhadron collisions, the Higgs couplings are not enough to tell us the relative sizes; we also\nneed to take into account incoming parton fluxes and final state phase space \u2013 single Higgs\nproduction is much less greedy than tt\u0304H associated production, for instance. In addition,\nthe internal propagator structure of the processes is important: W H,ZH bremsstrahlung\nare s-channel suppressed, but no other process is.\n\nFIG. 8: Feynman diagrams for the four dominant Higgs production processes at a hadron collider.\n5\n\nFor example, H \u2192 bb\u0304 is the dominant BR of a light Higgs, but QCD b jet pair production in hadron\ncollisions is many orders of magnitude larger.

Figure from the Tev4LHC Higgs working group [30].\n\nThe various rates, updated in 2006 with the latest theoretical calculations [30, 31], are\nshown in Fig. 9 for a light SM Higgs boson. Students not already familiar with hadron\ncollider Higgs physics will probably be surprised to learn that gg \u2192 H, gluon fusion Higgs\nproduction, dominates at Tevatron energy. This is partly because the coupling is actually\nnot all that small, partly because high-energy protons contain a plethora of gluons, and\npartly because there is no propagator suppression, and much less phase space suppression,\ncompared to other processes. Higgsstrahlung (Fig. 8(c)) is still important at Tevatron,\nanalogous to LEP. Note that the smaller cross sections have more complicated final states,\ntherefore potentially less background, and possibly distinctive kinematic distributions that\ncould assist in separating a signal from the background. It's not obvious that the largest rate\nis the most useful channel! Considering that the Higgs decays predominantly to different\nfinal states as a function of its mass, it's also not obvious that the optimal channel at one\nmass is optimal for all masses. In fact, that's definitely not the case.\nNot knowing the answer, we naturally start by considering the largest cross section times\nbranching ratio, gg \u2192 H \u2192 bb\u0304. Just how large is the background, QCD pp \u2192 bb\u0304 production?\nFig. 10 shows a variety of SM cross section for hadron collisions of various energy, and marks\noff in particular Tevatron and LHC. (The discontinuity in some curves is because Tevatron\nis pp\u0304 and LHC is pp.) We immediately notice that the bb\u0304 inclusive rate is almost nine orders\nof magnitude larger than inclusive H \u2192 bb\u0304. Of course the background will be smaller in\na finite window about the Higgs mass. But jets are not so well-measured, necessitating a\nfairly large window, \u223c15\u201320 GeV either side of the central value. We lose only a few orders\nof magnitude of the background, taking us from \"laughable\" to just terminally hopeless.\nThe general rule of thumb at hadron collider experiments is to require a final state with\n14\n\n\fproton - (anti)proton cross sections\n9\n\n9\n\n10\n\n10\n\n8\n\n10\n\n8\n\n10\n\n\u03c3tot\n\n7\n\n7\n\n10\n\nTevatron\n\nLHC\n\n6\n\n6\n\n10\n\n10\n\n5\n\n5\n\n10\n\n\u03c3b\n\n4\n\n10\n\n3\n\n3\n\n2\n\n\u03c3 (nb)\n\n10\njet\n\n\u03c3jet(ET\n\n> \u221as/20)\n\n2\n\n10\n\n\u03c3W\n\n1\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n\u03c3Z\n\n0\n\n10\n\n33\n\n10\n\njet\n\n\u03c3jet(ET\n\n0\n\n10\n\n> 100 GeV)\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\njet\n\n\u03c3jet(ET\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-5\n\n10\n\n-6\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n\u03c3t\n\n10\n\n> \u221as/4)\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n\u03c3Higgs(MH = 150 GeV)\n\n-5\n\n10\n\n-6\n\n10\n\n\u03c3Higgs(MH = 500 GeV)\n\n-7\n\n10\n\n-2 -1\n\n4\n\n10\n\nevents/sec for L = 10 cm s\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-7\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n10\n\n10\n\n\u221a s (TeV)\nFIG. 10: Various SM \"standard candle\" cross sections at hadron colliders of varying energy, with\nTevatron and LHC marked in particular.

This means lower backgrounds because the event had at\nleast some EW component, such as a W or Z, or came from a massive object, such as the\ntop quark, which is not produced in such great abundance due to phase space suppression.\nTevatron's Higgs search is rate-limited. We can see this by multiplying the 150 GeV Higgs\ncross section from Fig. 9 by the expected integrated luminosity of 4\u20138 fb\u22121 during Run II.\nBecause of this, and the very low efficiency of identifying final-state taus in a hadron collider\nenvironment (unlike at LEP), Tevatron's experiments CDF and D\u00d8 focus on the H \u2192 bb\u0304\nfinal state where that decay dominates the BR, and Higgsstrahlung to obtain the lepton tag.\nFor larger Higgs masses, where H \u2192 W + W \u2212 dominates, gluon fusion Higgs production is\nthe largest rate, but Higgsstrahlung has some analyzing power.

This is the same final state\nas our Higgs signal, with either extra jets or transverse energy imbalance. Kinematic cuts\nhelp, but because the detectors are imperfect some top quark events will leak through. Jet\nmismeasurement gives fake missing energy, for example (and is one of the most difficult\nuncertainties to quantify in a hadron collider experiment). In addition, QCD initial-state\nradiation from the incoming partons can give extra jets. Thus top quark and Higgs signal\nevents qualitatively become very similar. To control this further the experiments have to\nlook at other observables, such as angular distributions of the b jets and leptons. Other\nbackgrounds to consider are QCD W bb\u0304 production, weak bosons pairs where one decays to\nbb\u0304 (and thus has invariant mass close to the Higgs signal window).\n\n200\nWH Channels (NN)\n-1\n10 fb\n\n180\n160\n140\n\nWH mH=115 GeV\nWZ\nWbb\ntop\nPseudoexperiment\n\n120\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n\n0\n\n20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200\nmbb (GeV)\n\nFIG. 11: CDF simulations of a 115 GeV signal at Tevatron Run II in ZH (left) and W H (right)\nHiggsstrahlung production with Higgs decays H \u2192 bb\u0304 and assuming 10 fb\u22121 is collected [33].\n\n16\n\n\fFig. 11 shows the results of a CDF simulation study of W H and ZH Higgsstrahlung\nevents at Run II for MH = 115 GeV (right at the LEP Higgs limit) [33]. First note how the\ntop quark pair and diboson backgrounds peak very close to the Higgs mass. Eyeballing the\nplots and simplistically applying our knowledge of Gaussian statistics, we could easily believe\nthat this could yield a four or five sigma signal, perhaps combined with D\u00d8 results. However,\ncarefully observe that the shape of the invariant mass distribution for background alone and\nwith signal are extremely similar: they are both steeply falling; the Higgs signal is not a\nstand-out peak above a fairly flat background. Therein lies a hidden systematic! This means\nthat we must understand the kinematic-differential shape of the QCD backgrounds to a very\nhigh degree of confidence. This is not just knowing the SM background at higher orders\nin QCD, differentially, but also the detector response. This criticality is not appreciated in\nmost discussions of a potential discovery at Tevatron. It should be obvious that an excess\nin one of these channels would cause a scramble of cross-checking and probably further\ntheoretical work to ensure confidence, in spite of the statistics alone. We'll run into this\nfeature again with one of the LHC channels in Sec. II C 1, but quantified.\nCDF has in fact already observed an interesting candidate Higgs event in Run II, in the\nfirst few hundred pb\u22121 . It is in the ZH \u2192 \u03bd \u03bd\u0304bb\u0304 channel (a b jet pair plus missing transverse\nenergy). The event display and key kinematic information are shown in Fig. 12. Given the\nvery low b jet pair invariant mass, it's much more likely that the event came from EW ZZ or\nQCD Zbb\u0304 production (cf. Fig. 11). It therefore doesn't generate the kind of excitement that\nthe handful of events at LEP did. Nevertheless, finding this event was a milestone, showing\nthat CDF could perform such an analysis and find Higgs-like events with good efficiency.\n\nAn Interesting Candidate Event in CDF\n\nTwo b-tagged jets\n\nmjj= 82 GeV\nMissing ET=145 GeV\n\nJet1 ET= 100.3 GeV\nJet2 ET= 54.7 GeV\n\nCould be ZZ\n\nFIG. 12: Interesting bb/pT event at CDF in Tevatron Run II [34].\n\n17\n\n\fHiggs Mass (GeV/c2 )\nChannel Rate\n\n90\n\n100 110 120 130\n\nl\u00b1 \u03bdbb\u0304\n\nS\n8.7\nB\u221a\n28\nS/ B 1.6\n\n9.0\n39\n1.4\n\n4.8\n19\n1.1\n\n4.4\n26\n0.9\n\n3.7\n46\n0.5\n\n\u03bd \u03bd\u0304bb\u0304\n\nS\n12\n8\nB \u221a 123 70\nS/ B 1.1 1.0\n\n6.3\n55\n0.8\n\n4.7\n45\n0.7\n\n3.9\n47\n0.6\n\n0.8\n2.3\n0.5\n\n0.8\n2.8\n0.5\n\n0.6\n1.9\n0.4\n\nS\n1.2\nl+ l\u2212 bb\u0304 B \u221a\n2.9\nS/ B 0.7\nq q\u0304bb\u0304\n\n0.9\n1.9\n0.7\n\nS\n8.1 5.6 3.5 2.5 1.3\nB \u221a 6800 3600 2800 2300 2000\nS/ B 0.10 0.09 0.07 0.05 0.03\n\nTABLE I: Predicted signal significances at Tevatron Run II, for one detector and 1 fb\u22121 , for various\nV H, H \u2192 bb\u0304 searches, taken from Ref. [29].\n\nTable I summarizes the 2000 Tevatron Higgs Working Group Report predictions for Higgsstrahlung reach in Run II [29]. The results are quoted for one detector and per fb\u22121 , hence\nthe rather small significances. CDF and D\u00d8 will eventually combine results, giving a factor\nof two in statistics. However, it's not known how much data they'll eventually collect by\n2009 or 2010, when LHC is expected to have first physics results and CDF & D\u00d8 detector\ndegradation becomes an issue. Fairly low Higgs masses are shown, because when the report\nwas written nobody expected LEP to perform as well as it did, greatly exceeding its anticipated search reach. It should be obvious that a clear discovery would require a large amount\nof data, combining multiple channels, and the Higgs boson happening to be fairly light; not\nto mention the QCD shape systematic concern I described earlier (but is not quantified). In\nspite of this apparent pessimism, however, CDF and D\u00d8 seem to be performing modestly\nbetter than expected \u2013 higher efficiencies for b tagging and phase space coverage, better jet\nresolution, etc. There is as yet no detailed updated report with tables such as this, but there\nare some newer graphically-presented expectations I'll show as a summary.\n2.\n\ngg \u2192 H \u2192 W + W \u2212 at Tevatron\n\nFor MH & 140 GeV, a SM Higgs will decay mostly to W pairs (cf. Fig. 4), which has\na decent rate to dileptons and has very little SM background \u2013 essentially just EW W\npair production, with some background from top quark pairs where both b jets are lost.\nThis channel has some special characteristics due to how the Higgs decay proceeds. There\nis a marked angular correlation between the outgoing leptons which differs from the SM\nbackgrounds: they prefer to be emitted together, that is close to the same flight direction\nin the center-of-mass frame [35].\nTo understand this correlation, consider what happens if the Higgs decays to a pair of\ntransversely-polarized W bosons. For W decays, the lepton angle with respect to the W \u00b1\nspin follows a (1 \u00b1 cos \u03b8l\u00b1 )2 distribution. That is, the positively-charged lepton prefers to be\nemitted with the W spin, while the negatively-charged lepton prefers to be emitted opposite\nthe W spin. Since the Higgs is a scalar (spin-0), the W spins are anti-correlated, thus\n18\n\n\fthe leptons are preferentially emitted in the same direction. For longitudinal W bosons, the\nlepton follows a sin2 \u03b8l distribution. The W spins are still correlated, however, and the matrix\nelement squared (an excellent exercise for the student) is proportional to (pl\u2212 * p\u03bd )(pl+ * p\u03bd\u0304 ).\nSince a charged lepton and neutrino are emitted back-to-back in the W rest frame, this is\nagain maximized for the charged leptons emitted together. This correlation is shown visually\nby the schematic of Fig. 13. Projected onto the azimuthal plane (transverse to the beam),\nits efficacy is shown in Fig. 14 by comparison to various backgrounds [29, 36].\n\nFIG. 13: Diagram showing the preferred flight direction of charged leptons in H \u2192 l+ \u03bdl\u2212 \u03bd\u0304.\n\n\u03a6(ll) degrees\n\n\u03a6(ll) degrees\n\n\u03a6(ll) degrees\n\n\u03a6(ll) degrees\n\n\u03a6(ll) degrees\n\n\u03a6(ll) degrees\n\nFIG. 14: Dilepton azimuthal angular correlation for a H \u2192 W + W \u2212 \u2192 l+ \u03bdl\u2212 \u03bd\u0304 signal and its\nbackgrounds. The efficacy of the cut (vertical line) can easily be estimated visually. From the\nTevatron Run II Higgs Working Group Report [29].\n\nIn addition to this angular correlation, we may also construct a transverse mass (MT )\nfor the system, despite the fact that two neutrinos go missing [37]. We first write down the\ntransverse energy (pT ) of the dilepton and missing transverse energy (/ET ) systems,\nq\nq\nE\n/T =\n(8)\np~2T + \u2212 + m2l+ l\u2212 ,\np/~2T + m2l+ l\u2212\nETl+ l\u2212 =\nl\n\nl\n\n19\n\n\fwhere I've substituted the dilepton invariant mass m2l+ l\u2212 for m2\u03bd \u03bd\u0304 . This is exact at H \u2192 W W\nthreshold, and is a very good approximation for Higgs masses below about 200 GeV and\nwhere this decay mode is open. The W pair transverse mass is now straightforward:\nq\nMTW W =\n(/ET + ETl+ l\u2212 )2 \u2212 (~pTl+ l\u2212 + p/~T )2\n(9)\nThis gives a nice Jacobian peak for the Higgs signal, modulo detector missing-transverseenergy resolution, whereas the SM backgrounds tend to be comparatively flat.\nUtilizing these techniques gives Tevatron some reach for a heavier Higgs boson, mostly\nin the mass range 150 . MH . 180 GeV, where the BR to W W is significant and the Higgs\nproduction rate is not too small.\n3.\n\nTevatron Higgs summary expectations\n\n-1\n\nInt. Luminosity per Exp. (fb )\n\nTevatron Higgs physics expectations have changed since the 2000 Report, as D\u00d8 and\nCDF have better understood their detectors and made analysis improvements. As yet, the\nonly progress summary is from 2003, shown in Fig. 15. It compares the original Report's\nfindings, shown by the thick curves, with improved findings for the low-mass region, shown\nby the thinner lines. However, the new results do not yet include systematic uncertainties,\nwhich may be considerable. We should expect some form of a new summary expectation\nsometime in 2007. A final note on the undiscussed WBF production mode: some study has\nbeen done (see Sec. II.C.4 of Ref. [29]), but D\u00d8 and CDF both lack sufficient coverage of\nthe forward region to use this mode. This is not the case at LHC.\nRun II now has about 1 fb\u22121 of analyzed data, and a Higgs search summary progress\nreport is available in Ref. [38], which updates each channel's expectations.\n\n10\n\n2\n\nSUSY/Higgs Workshop\n('98-'99)\nHiggs Sensitivity Study ('03)\nstatistical power only\n(no systematics)\n\n10\n\n5 \u03c3 Discovery\n3 \u03c3 Evidence\n95% CL Exclusion\n\n1\n\n100 110 120 130 140 150 160 170 180 190\n2\n\nHiggs Mass mH (GeV/c )\nFIG. 15: Expected required integrated luminosity per experiment required in Run II to observe a\nSM Higgs as a function of MH [33].\n\n20\n\n\fC.\n\nHiggs at LHC\n\nHiggs physics at LHC will be similar to that at Tevatron. There is the slight difference\nthat LHC will be pp collisions rather than pp\u0304. The biggest difference, however, is the\nincreased energy, from 2 to 14 TeV. Particle production in the 100 GeV mass range will be\nat far lower Feynman x, where the gluon density is much larger than the quark density. In\nfact, it's useful (for Higgs physics) to think of the LHC as a gluon collider to first order.\nThe ratio between gluon fusion Higgs production and Higgsstrahlung is thus larger than at\nTevatron. Fig. 16 displays the various SM Higgs cross sections, only over a much larger\nrange of MH \u2013 at LHC, large-MH cross sections are not trivially small, compared to at the\nTevatron. There are huge QCD corrections to the gg \u2192 H rate (also at Tevatron), but\nthese are now known at NNLO and under control [39] (and included in Fig. 16). They don't\naffect the basic phenomenology, however. Knowing that LHC is plans to collect several\nhundred fb\u22121 of data, a quick calculation reveals that the LHC will truly be a Higgs factory,\nproducing hundreds of thousands of light Higgs bosons, or tens of thousands if it's heavy.\nLooking back at Fig. 10, we see that while the Higgs cross section rises quite steeply\nwith collision energy (gg \u2192 H is basically a QCD process), so do important backgrounds\nlike top quark production. The inclusive b cross section is still too large to access to gg \u2192\nH \u2192 bb\u0304, but note that the EW gauge boson cross sections do not rise as swiftly with energy.\nImmediately we realize that channels like gg \u2192 H \u2192 W + W \u2212 should have a much better\nsignal-to-background (S/B) ratio. (In fact it suffers from non-trivial single-top quark [40]\nand gg \u2192 W + W \u2212 [41] backgrounds, but is still an excellent channel for MH & 150 GeV.)\nThe figure does not show cross sections like W bb\u0304 or Zbb\u0304, which grow QCD-like and thus\nbecome a terminal problem for W H and ZH channels.\n\nSM Higgs production\n\n10 5\n\nLHC\n\n\u03c3 [fb]\ngg \u2192 h\n\n10\n\n4\nqq \u2192 qqh\n\n10 3\nqq \u2192 Wh\nbb \u2192 h\n\n10\n\ngg,qq \u2192 tth\n\n2\nqb \u2192 qth\nTeV4LHC Higgs working group\n\n100\n\nqq \u2192 Zh\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\nmh [GeV]\n\u221a\nFIG. 16: Cross sections for Higgs production in various channels at LHC ( s = 14 TeV) [30].\n\n21\n\n\fObviously there are a few significant differences between Tevatron and LHC with implications for Higgs physics. We'll lose access to W H and ZH at low mass, at least for Higgs\ndecay to b jets. What about rare decays, since the production rate is large? The tt\u0304H cross\nsection is large and would yield a healthy event rate. It's complexity is distinctive, so one\nmight speculate that perhaps it could be useful. WBF production is also accessible due to\nbetter detectors, and likewise its more complex signature is worthy of a look. It will in fact\nturn out to be perhaps the best production mode at LHC.\nAs with Tevatron, we need to understand both the signal and background for each Higgs\nchannel we wish to examine. As a prelude to Chapter III, Higgs measurements, at LHC we\nwon't want to just find the Higgs in one mode. Rather, we'll want to observe it in as many\nproduction and decay modes as possible, to study all its properties, such as couplings.\n1.\n\ntt\u0304H, H \u2192 bb\u0304\n\n25\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\nttH, H \u2192 bb\n\nCMS\n20\n\n2\n\nmH: 115 GeV/c\n\n-1\n\nEvents for 30 fb / 10 GeV/c\n\n2\n\nLet's begin by discussing a very complex channel, top quark associated production at\nlow mass, tt\u0304H, H \u2192 bb\u0304. This was studied early on in the ATLAS TDR [42] and in various\nobscure CMS notes, and found to be a sure-fire way to find a light Higgs. Fig. 17 shows\na schematic of such an event, with multiple b jets from both top quarks and the Higgs, at\nleast one lepton from a W for triggering, and possibly extra soft jets from QCD radiation.\nThe schematic is a bit fanciful in the neatness of separation of the decay products, but is\nuseful to get an idea of what's going on.\nThese early studies [42, 43, 44, 45] were too ambitious, however. The backgrounds to\nthis signal are tt\u0304bb\u0304 and tt\u0304jj 6 production, pure QCD processes. The extra (b) jets must be\nfairly energetic, or hard, because the signal is a 100+ GeV-mass object which decays to\nessentially massless objects. Despite this being a known problem [46], these backgrounds\nwere calculated using the soft/collinear approximation for extra jet emission implemented\nin standard Monte Carlo tools such as pythia or herwig. This greatly underestimated the\nbackgrounds.\n\n15\n10\n5\n0\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n250\n300\n2\nminv(j,j) [GeV/c ]\n\nFIG. 17: Left: schematic of the outgoing particles in a typical tt\u0304H, H \u2192 bb\u0304 event at LHC [47].\nRight: early CMS study expectations for a bb\u0304 mass peak in such events, for MH = 115 GeV [44, 45].\n6\n\nNon-b jets can fake b jets with a probability of about 1% or a little less.\n\n22\n\n\fS/B\n\n2\n\n10\u03c3\n\nEvents / 10 GeV\n\n1.8\n\n100\n\nttH(120)\nttjj\nttbb (QCD)\nttbb (EW)\n\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\nSaturation of Signal Significance\nN\u03c3 Significance Contours\n\n9\u03c3\n\n1.6\n\n8\u03c3\nVBF H\u2192 \u03c4\u03c4\u2192 e\u03bc (120)\nttH (H\u2192bb) (110)\n\n1.4\n\n7\u03c3\n\n1.2\n\n6\u03c3\n\n1\n\n5\u03c3\n\n0.8\n\n4\u03c3\n\n0.6\n\n3\u03c3\n\n0.4\n\n2\u03c3\n\n0.2\n\n1\u03c3\n\n0\n\nmbb (GeV)\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12 14 16 18 20\nSystematic Error %\n\nFIG. 18: Left: results of a more up-to-date ATLAS studying of tt\u0304H, H \u2192 bb\u0304 production at LHC,\nfor 30 fb\u22121 of data and a Higgs mass of MH = 120 GeV [47]. The QCD backgrounds were\ncalculated with exact matrix elements rather than in the soft/collinear approximation. Right:\nmaximum achievable signal significance for two LHC Higgs channels as a function of S/B and\nshape systematic uncertainty \u25b3 [49], as discussed in the text.\n\nThe left panel of Fig. 18 shows the results of a repeated study by ATLAS using a proper\nbackground calculation [47]. (Recent CMS studies found similar results, and the new CMS\nTDR [48] does not even bother to discuss this channel.) There is no longer any clearly-visible\nmass peak, and S/B is now about 1/6, much poorer. While the figure reflects only 1/10 of\nthe expected total integrated luminosity at LHC, statistics is not the problem. Rather, it is\nsystematic: uncertainty on the exact shape of the QCD backgrounds.\nTherein lies the sleeping dragon. Now is a good time to explain how systematic errors\nmay enter our estimate of signal significance. Our simple formula is modified:\nS\nS\n\u221a\n\u2192 p\nB\nB(1 + B\u25b32 )\n\nL\u2192\u221e\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\nS/B\n\u25b3\n\n(10)\n\nwhere \u25b3 is the shape uncertainty in the background, a kind of normalization uncertainty.\nIn the limit of infinite data, if S/B is fixed (which it is), signal significance saturates. The\nonly way around this is to perform higher-order calculations of the background to reduce \u25b3\n(and hope you understand the residual theoretical uncertainties). The right panel of Fig. 18\nshows the spectrum of possibilities [49]. For the known 10% QCD shape systematic for tt\u0304H,\neven an infinite amount of data would never be able to grant us more than about a 3\u03c3\nsignificance. This could still potentially be useful for a coupling measurement, albeit poorly,\nbut will not be a discovery channel unless higher-order QCD calculations can improve the\nsituation. Calculating even just tt\u0304bb\u0304 at NLO is currently beyond the state of the art, but is\nlikely to become feasible within a few years.\nWhile I don't discuss it here, top quark associated Higgs production does show some\npromise for the rare Higgs decays to photons. Photons are very clean, well-measured, and\nthe detectors have good rejection against QCD jet fakes. The final word probably hasn't\nbeen written on this, but the CMS TDR [48] does have updated simulation results which\nthe interested student may read up on.\n23\n\n\f2.\n\ngg \u2192 H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3\n\nSignal-background, events / 2 GeV\n\nEvents / 2 GeV\n\nWe've just seen that QCD can be a really annoying problem for Higgs hunting at LHC.\nA logical alternative for a low-mass Higgs is to look for its rare decays to EW objects, e.g.\nphotons. The BR is at about the two per-mille level for a light Higgs, 110 . MH . 140 GeV.\nThe LHC will certainly produce enough Higgses, but what are the backgrounds like?\nIt turns out that the loop-induced QCD process gg \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 is a non-trivial contribution,\nbut we also have to worry about single and double jet fakes from QCD j\u03b3 and jj production.\nThis occurs when a leading \u03c0 0 from jet fragmentation goes to photons, depositing most of\nthe energy in the EM calorimeter, thereby looking like a real photon. Fortunately, because\nphotons and jets are massless, the invariant mass distribution obeys a very linear 1/m\u03b3\u03b3\nfalloff in our region of interest. The experiments can in that case normalize the background\nvery precisely from the sidebands, where we know there is no Higgs signal. Shape systematics\nare not much of a concern, thus avoiding the pitfalls of the tt\u0304H, H \u2192 bb\u0304 case.\nFig. 19 shows the results of an ATLAS study for this channel using 30 fb\u22121 of data [42],\n1/10 of the LHC run program or 3 years at low-luminosity running. The exact expectations\nare still uncertain, mostly due to an ongoing factor of two uncertainty in the fake jet rejection\nefficiency. A conservative estimate shows that this channel isn't likely to be the first discovery\nmode, but would be crucial for measuring the Higgs mass precisely at low MH , to about\n1% [42, 48]. Photon energy calibration nonlinearity in the detector may be an issue for the\nultimate precision, but is generally regarded as minor. We'll come back to this point in\nChapter III on Higgs property measurements.\nWhile I focus here on the SM, keep in mind that because H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 is a rare decay, it can\nbe very sensitive to new physics. Recall that the coupling is induced via both top quark\nand W loops which mostly cancel. Depending on how the new physics alters couplings,\nor what new particles appear in the loop, the partial width could be greatly suppressed\nor enhanced.

It was long ignored for LHC light Higgs phenomenology because its\nrate is about an order of magnitude smaller than gg \u2192 H there. However, it has quite\ndistinctive kinemattics and QCD properties that make it easy to suppress backgrounds, for\nall Higgs decay channels. The process itself is described by an incoming pair of quark partons\nwhich brem a pair of weak gauge bosons, which fuse to produce a Higgs; see Fig. 20.\nThe first distinctive characteristic of WBF7 is that the quarks scatter with significant\ntransverse momentum, and will show up as far forward and backward jets in the hadronic\ncalorimeters of CMS and ATLAS. The Higgs boson is produced centrally, however, so its\ndecay products, regardless of decay mode, typically show up in the central detector region.\nThis is shown in the lego plot schematic in the right panel of Fig. 208 .\n\nW,Z\nH\nW,Z\n\nFIG. 20: WBF Higgs production Feynman diagram and lego plot schematic of a typical event.\n\nThe reason for this scattering behavior comes from the W (or Z) propagator, 1/(Q2 \u2212\nM ). For t-channel processes, Q2 is necessarily always negative. Thus the propagator\nsuppresses the amplitude least when Q2 is small. For small Q2 , we have Q2 = (pf \u2212\npi )2 \u2248 Eq2 (1 \u2212 x)\u03b82 , where x is the fraction of incoming quark energy the weak boson takes\nwith it, and is small. Thus \u03b8 prefers to be small, translating into large pseudorapidity.\nOne quark will be scattered in the far forward detector, the other far backward, and the\npseudorapidity separation between them will tend to be large. We call these \"tagging\" jets.\nQCD processes with an extra EW object(s) which mimics a Higgs decay, on the other hand,\nhave a fundamentally different propagator structure and prefer larger scattering angles [52,\n53], including at NLO [54]. The differences between the two are shown in Fig. 21 [55].\nThe second distinctive characteristic is QCD radiation [56]. Additional jet activity\nin WBF prefers to be forward of the scattered quarks. This is because it occurs via\nbremsstrahlung off color charge, which is scattered at small angles, with no connection\nbetween them. In contrast, QCD production always involves color charge being exchanged\nbetween the incoming partons: acceleration through 180 degrees. QCD bremsstrahlung thus\ntakes place over large angles, covering the central region. Central jet activity can be vetoed,\ngiving large background suppression [57]. We won't discuss it further, due to theoretical\nuncertainties; the interested student may learn more from Ref. [58].\n2\n\n7\n\n8\n\nSome experimentalists refer to this as vector boson fusion (VBF), even though the vector QCD boson\n(gluon) process of Fig. 22 is not included. This will cause increasing confusion as time goes by.\nThe angle \u03c6 is the azimuthal angle perpendicular to the beam axis. Pseudorapidity \u03b7 is a boost-invariant\ndescription the polar scattering angle, \u03b7 = \u2212 log(tan 2\u03b8 ). The lego plot is a Cartesian map of the finiteresolution detector in these coordinates, as if the detector had been sliced lengthwise and unrolled.\n\n25\n\n\fArbitrary units\n\n0.08\n\nArbitrary units\n\n0.05\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\n0.03\n\n0.04\n0.02\n0.02\n0.01\n\n0\n\n0\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n\u03b7\n\n10\n\n\u2206\u03b7\n\nFIG. 21: Tagging jet rapidity (left) and separation (right) for WBF Higgs production v. QCD tt\u0304\nproduction [55].\n\nWe'll see in the next few subsections that WBF Higgs channels are extremely powerful\neven without a central jet (minijet) veto9 . Eventually a veto will be used, after calibration\nfrom observing EW v. QCD Zjj production in the early running of LHC [53]. There is\nhowever another lingering theoretical uncertainty, coming from Higgs production itself!\nQCD Higgs production via loop-induced couplings may itself give rise to two forward\ntagging jets, which would then fall into the WBF Higgs sample [60]. Some representative\nFeynman diagrams for this process are shown in Fig. 22. After imposing WBF-type kinematic cuts (far forward/backward, well-separated jets, central Higgs decay products), this\ncontribution to the WBF sample adds about another third for a light Higgs, or doubles it for\na very heavy Higgs, MH & 350 GeV, as shown in the left panel of Fig. 23. The residual QCD\ntheoretical cross section uncertainty is about a factor of two, however, and being QCD it\nwill produce far more central jets, which will be vetoed to reject QCD backgrounds. Na\u0131\u0308vely,\nthen, gluon fusion Hjj is an \u223c 10% contribution to WBF, but with a huge uncertainty.\nThis contribution is a mixed blessing. It's part of the signal, so would hasten discovery.\nYet it creates confusion, since at some point we want to measure couplings, and the WBF and\ngluon fusion components arise from different couplings. Fortunately, there is a difference!\nWBF produces an almost-flat distribution in \u03c6jj , the azimuthal tagging jet separation, but\ngluon fusion has a suppression at 90 degrees [60]; cf. right panel of Fig. 23.\n\nH\n\nH\nH\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nFIG. 22: Representative Feynman diagrams for gluon fusion Higgs plus two jets production [60].\n9\n\nA technical topic outside our present scope: see Refs.

[60].\n\n4.\n\nWeak boson fusion H \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212\n\nNow we know that the WBF signature can strongly suppress QCD backgrounds because of\nits unique kinematic characteristics. We expect that H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 is visible in WBF [48, 61, 62],\nbut being a rare decay in a smaller-rate channel, it's not expected to lead to discovery.\nRather, it would be a useful additional channel for couplings measurements. Let's now\ninstead discuss a decay mode we haven't yet considered, H \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 . This is sub-dominant\nto H \u2192 bb\u0304 in the light Higgs region, MH . 150 GeV, but the backgrounds are more EW than\nQCD. We thus have some hope to see it, whereas H \u2192 bb\u0304 remains frustratingly hopeless.\nWe first have to realize that taus decay to a variety of final states:\n* 35% \u03c4 \u2192 l\u03bdl \u03bd\u03c4 , ID efficiency \u01ebl \u223c 90%\n\n* 50% \u03c4 \u2192 h1 \u03bd\u03c4 \"1-prong\" hadronic (one charged track), ID efficiency \u01ebh \u223c 25%\n\n* 15% \u03c4 \u2192 h3 \u03bd\u03c4 \"3-prong\" hadronic (three charged tracks), which are thrown away\n\nThe obvious problem is that with at least two neutrinos escaping, the Higgs cannot be\nreconstructed from its decay products. Or can it?\nLet's assume the taus decay collinearly. This is an excellent approximation: since\n50+ GeV energy taus have far more energy than their mass, so their decay products are\nhighly collimated. We then have two unknowns, x+ and x\u2212 , the fractions of tau energy\nthat the charged particles take with them. What experiment measures is missing transverse\nenergy in the x and y directions. Two unknowns with two measurements is exactly solvable.\nFor our system this gives [63]:\nm2\u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 =\n\nm2l+ l\u2212\n+ 2m2\u03c4\nx+ x\u2212\n\n(11)\n\n(an excellent exercise for all students to get a grip on kinematics and useful tricks at hadron\ncolliders). An important note is that this doesn't work for back-to-back taus (the derivation\nwill reveal why), but WBF Higgses are typically kicked out with about 100 GeV of pT , so\n27\n\n\fthis almost never happens in WBF. This trick can't be used in the bulk of gg \u2192 H events\nbecause there it is produced mostly at rest with nearly all taus back-to-back.\nWe need a lepton trigger, so consider two channels: \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 l\u00b1 h and \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 l+ l\u2032\u2212\n(l = e, \u03bc). The main backgrounds are EW and QCD Zjj production (really Z/\u03b3 \u2217 ), top\nquark pairs, EW & QCD W W jj and QCD bb\u0304jj production. But after reconstruction, the\nnon-Z backgrounds look very different than the signal in x+ \u2013x\u2212 space, as shown in Fig. 24.\nATLAS and CMS have both studied these channels with full detector simulation and\nWBF kinematic cuts, but no minijet veto, and found extremely promising results [55].\nFig. 25 shows invariant mass distributions for a reconstructed Higgs in the two different\ndecay channels, assuming only 30 fb\u22121 of data. The Higgs peak is easily seen above the\nbackgrounds and away from the Z pole. Mass resolution is expected to be a few GeV.\n\n8\n7\n\nnev/5 GeV for L=30 fb-1\n\nevts / 5 GeV\n\nFIG. 24: Reconstructed x+ v. x\u2212 (x1 , x2 ) for a WBF H \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 signal v. non-Z backgrounds [64].\n\nmH=120 GeV\n\n6\n\nZ jj\n\n5\n\n\uf8e7\n\n4\n\nt t, WW EW\n\n8\n7\n6\n5\n4\n\n3\n\n3\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160 180\nm\u03c4\u03c4 (GeV)\n\n0\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\n180\n\n200\n\nM\u03c4\u03c4, GeV\n\nFIG. 25: ATLAS (left) and CMS (right) simulations of WBF H \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 events after 30 fb\u22121 of\ndata at LHC. The Higgs resonance clearly stands out from the background. Figures from Ref. [55].\n\n28\n\n\fBut this joint study by CMS and ATLAS [55] is not the best we can do. The joint\nstudy ignored the minijet veto, for instance. While that will assuredly improve the situation\nfurther, we're just not sure precisely how much. Putting this aside for the moment, there\nare yet further tricks to play to improve the situation.\nThe leading idea zeroes in on the fact that missing transverse momentum (/pT ) has some\nuncertainty due to jet energy mismeasurement (those imperfect detectors). Using a \u03c72 test,\none determines which is more likely: Z \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 or H \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 , using a fixed Higgs mass\nconstraint [65]. Examining the schematics in Fig. 26, we see this is tantamount to deciding\nwhich fit is closer to the center of the p/T uncertainty region. Early indications are that this\ntechnique would improve S/B by about a factor four, in addition to recovering some signal\nlost using more traditional strict kinematic cuts on x+ and x\u2212 (recall Fig. 24). This would\napproximately halve the data required to discover a light SM Higgs boson using this channel.\nKeep it in mind when we see the current official discovery expectations in Sec. II C 7. Further\nimprovements might also be expected from neural-net type analyses, which are coming to\nthe fore now that Tevatron has demonstrated their viability.\nA final word on systematic uncertainties. Unlike the tortuous case of tt\u0304H, H \u2192 bb\u0304,\nwe don't have to worry about shape systematics here. The dominant background is Zjj\nproduction. We can separately examine Z \u2192 ee, \u03bc\u03bc, which produces an extremely sharp,\nclean peak, precisely calibrating Zjj production in Monte Carlo. The only uncertainty then\nis tau decay modeling, which is very well understood from the LEP era.\n\nMissingET\nContour\n\nMeasured MissingET\n\nMi\nMa ssin\nss gE\nCo T w\nns ith\ntra\nint Higg\n\ns\n\nVisible Tau Decay Products\n\nj\n\nMissingET with Z Mass Constraint\n\nj\nH\n\nBest Fit of MissingET\nwith Z Mass Constraint\n\nBest Fit of MissingET with\nHiggs Mass Constraint\n\n\u03c4\n\nl\n\n\u03c4 h\nVisible Tau Decay Products\n\nFIG. 26: Left: schematic azimuthal projection of WBF H \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 events at LHC.

We should expect fairly well, since it's the production\nprocess characteristics that supply most of the background suppression, leaving us only to\nlook for separated reconstructed mass peaks.\nFor H \u2192 W + W \u2212 we'll consider only the dilepton channel, as it has relatively low backgrounds, while QCD gives a large rate for the other possible channel, one central lepton plus\ntwo central jets (and the minijet veto will likely not work). We'll therefore rely on exactly\nthe same angular correlations and transverse mass variable we encountered in the Tevatron\ncase [37] (cf. Eqs. 8,9). The only critical distinction is then e\u03bc v. ee, \u03bc\u03bc samples, as the\nlatter have a continuum background (Z \u2217 /\u03b3 \u2217 ). These are not too much of a concern, however.\nWithout going too much into detail, I'll simply say that top quarks are a major background, and they have the largest uncertainty. The largest component comes from tt\u0304j\nproduction, where the extra hard parton is far forward and ID'd as one tagging jet; a b\njet from top decay gives the other tagging jet, and the other b jet is unobserved. This\nbackground requires care to simulate, because the soft/collinear approximation in standard\ncodes is no good. There is also a significant contribution from single-top production, and\noff-shell effects are crucial to simulate, which is not normally an issue for backgrounds at\nLHC [66]. Work is still needed in this area to be fully prepared for this particular search\nchannel. Fortunately, we may expect an NLO calculation of tt\u0304j before LHC start [67].\nFig. 27 shows the results of the same ATLAS/CMS joint WBF Higgs study for this\nchannel [55]. The results are extremely positive, with S/B > 1/1 without a minijet veto\nover a large mass range; even for MH = 120 GeV, S/B \u223c 1/2, allowing for Higgs observation\neven down to the LEP limit in this channel. The transverse mass variable works extremely\nwell for Higgs masses near W W threshold, and reasonably well for lower masses, where the\nW bosons are off-shell.\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\nmT (GeV)\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\nmT (GeV)\n\nFIG. 27: ATLAS simulations of WBF H \u2192 W + W \u2212 events after 30 fb\u22121 of data at LHC for\nMH = 140 GeV (left) and 160 GeV (right). The Higgs signal clearly stands out from the background\nin both cases, although the Jacobian peak is easier to identify closer to threshold. Figures taken\nfrom Ref. [55].\n\n30\n\n\f6.\n\ntt\u0304H, H \u2192 W + W \u2212 at higher mass\n\nA late entry to the Higgs game at LHC is top quark associated production, but with Higgs\ndecaying to W bosons. Representative Feynman diagrams are shown in Fig. 28. Obviously\nthis is intended to apply to larger Higgs masses, but turns out to work fairly well even below\nW pair threshold [68, 69]. The key is to use same-sign dilepton and trilepton subsamples.\nThe backgrounds then don't come from pure QCD production, rather from mixed QCD-EW\ntop quark pairs plus W , Z/\u03b3 \u2217, W + W \u2212 , etc. We would be especially eager to observe this\nchannel because, if the HW W coupling is measured elsewhere, it provides the only viable\ndirect measurement of the top quark Yukawa coupling. More on this in Chapter III.\nA noteworthy features of this channel is that while the tt\u0304H cross section falls with increasing MH , BR(H \u2192 W + W \u2212 ) rises with increasing MH in our mass region of interest,\nand the two trends coincidentally approximately balance each other. From a final-state rate\nperspective, this channel is approximately constant over a wide mass range, up to about\n200 GeV. Fig. 29 shows this numerically. Fig. 30 shows ATLAS's expected statistical uncertainty on the top quark Yukawa coupling. It ranges from about 20% over a broad mass\nrange for 30 fb\u22121 of data, to about 10% from the full LHC run.

Rumors have been\ncirculating for months about excess events showing up in some light Higgs channels, but not\nall that would be expected. LHC has 40 fb\u22121 , after all. Your experimental friends tell you\nthat both collaborations have been scrambling madly, independent groups cross-checking\nthe original first analyses. Then the null result slides start passing by. No diphoton peaks\nanywhere. Nothing in the W W or ZZ channels. Even CMS's invisible Higgs search (WBF\n\u2013 tagging jets with no central objects at all) doesn't show anything. Numerous standard\nMSSM Higgs results fly by, invariant mass spectra fitting the SM predictions perfectly. The\naudience becomes restless, irritated. People around you mutter that there must not be a\nHiggs after all. But you realize that the speaker skipped mention of the WBF H \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212\nchannel. Then suddenly it appears, and there's a peak above the Z pole, centered around\n125 GeV, broader than you'd expect but the speaker says something about resolution will\nimprove with further refinement of the tau reconstruction algorithms. It's also a too-small\nrate, less than half what's expected.\nSo what is this beast? The bump showed up in a Higgs search channel, but at that mass it\nshould have shown up in several others as well. If it's Standard Model, that is. At 125 GeV\nthere should be H \u2192 W + W \u2212 in WBF, and H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3 both inclusively and in WBF, although\nmaybe they're still marginal. Photons turned out to be hard at first, and QCD predictions\nweren't quite on the mark. Quite a few people are on their cell phones already. You hear a\ndozen different exclamations, ranging from \"We found the Higgs!\" to \"The Standard Model\nis dead!\". Quite obviously this is a new physics discovery, but what exactly is going on?\nBy now you should get the point of this imaginary scenario: finding a new bump is\nmerely the start of real physics. For numerous reasons you've heard at this summer school,\nsome better than others, finding a SM Higgs really isn't very likely. But as we'll see in\nChapter IV, SM Higgs phenomenology is a superb base for beyond-the-SM (BSM) Higgs\nsectors. They're variations on a theme in some sense, with the occasional special channel\nthrown in, like the invisible Higgs search alluded to above. Our job will be to figure out\nwhat any new resonance is. But how do we go about doing that in a systematic way that's\nuseful to theorists for constructing the New Standard Model?\nFor starters, we want to know the complete set of quantum numbers for any Higgs\ncandidate we find. Standard Model expectations will probably prejudice us as to what they\nare (roughly, at least) based on which search channel a bump shows up in. But for the\nscenario above, I can envision at least three very reasonable yet completely different models\nthat would give that kind of a result in early LHC running. We should keep in mind that\nfurther data may reveal more resonances \u2013 not everything is easy to see against backgrounds,\nor is produced with enough rate to emerge with only 1/10 of the planned LHC data. In\nsome cases we would have to wait much longer, using data from the planned LHC luminosity\nupgrade (SLHC) [70]. New physics could also mean new quantum numbers that we don't\nyet know about, so we should be prepared to expand our list of measurements needed to\nsort out the theory, and spend time now thinking about what kinds of observables are even\npossible at the LHC. Some measurements will almost certainly require the clean environment\nof a future high-energy electron-positron machine like an ILC [71, 72]. The most complete\npicture would emerge only after combining results [73], which could take than a decade. In\nthe meantime we might get a good picture of the new physics, but not its details.\n33\n\n\fLet's prepare a preliminary list of quantum numbers we need to measure for a candidate\nHiggs resonance, which I'll generically call \u03c6. In brackets is the SM expectation. I'll order\nthem in increasing level of difficulty. (See also the review article of Ref. [74].)\n* electric charge [neutral]\n* color charge [neutral]\n\n* mass [free parameter]\n* spin [0]\n\n* CP [even]\n\n* gauge coupling (gW W H ) [SU(2)L with tensor structure g \u03bc\u03bd ]\n\n* Yukawa couplings [mf /v]\n\n* spontaneous symmetry breaking potential (self-couplings) [fixed by the mass]\n\nOf course, the first two of those, electric and color charge, are known immediately from\nthe decay products. (A non-color-singlet scalar is a radically different beast than the SM\nHiggs and would have dramatically different couplings and signatures.) Mass is also almost\nimmediate, with some level of uncertainty that depends almost purely on detector effects.\nSpin and CP are related to some degree, and not entirely straightforward if the Higgs sector\nis non-minimal and contains CP violation. Gauge and Yukawa couplings are generally\nregarded as the most crucial observables, and in some sense I would agree. However, I\nwould argue that the linchpin of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) is the existence of\na Higgs potential, which requires Higgs self-couplings. Measuring these and finding they\nmatch to some gauge theory with a SSB Higgs sector would to me be the most definitive\nproof of SSB, and strongly suggest that the Higgs is a fundamental scalar, not composite.\nIt is also the most difficult task \u2013 perhaps not even possible.\nA cautionary note: the results I show in this section are in general applicable only to\nthe Standard Model Higgs! This point is often lost in many presentations highlighting\nthe capabilities of various experiments, but it is very easy to understand. For example, if\nfor some reason the Higgs sector has suppressed couplings to colored fermions, then any\nmeasurement of, say, the b Yukawa coupling, will be less precise, simply because the signal\nrate is lower, yet the background remains fixed. It's statistics!\nA.\n\nMass measurement\n\nAs already noted, our Higgs hunt pretty much gets us this quantum number immediately,\nbut with some slop driven by detector performance. We want to measure it as accurately\nas possible, but in practice a GeV or so is good enough, because theoretical uncertainties in\nparameter fits tend to dominate for most BSM physics. (This is a long-standing problem in\nSUSY scenarios, for example. It may be that we need to know the Higgs mass theoretical\nprediction to four loops [75]; at present only a partial three-loop calculation is known [76],\nand only two-loop results exist in usable code [77].) Fig. 32 shows the CMS and ILC expected\nHiggs mass precision as a function of MH [78]. It varies, of course, because different decay\nmodes are accessible at different MH , and detector resolution depends on the final state.\nIn general, photon pairs (H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3) and four leptons coming from Z pairs (H \u2192 ZZ \u2192\nl+ l\u2212 l\u2032+ l\u2032\u2212 ) will give the most precise measurement. As a rule of thumb, we may expect\nper-mille precision over a broad mass range, translating typically to a few hundred MeV.\n34\n\n\f\u2206m/m [%]\n\n\u278a CMS: Lint = 300 fb-1 \u03bc\u03bc\u03bc\u03bc\n\n0.4\n\n\u278b\n\n-1\n\n\u278b LC350: Lint = 500 fb Hll\n\u278c LC500: Lint = 500 fb-1 Hll\n\n0.35\n\n\u278a\n\n\u278d LC500: Lint = 500 fb-1 bbqq\n\u278d\n\n0.3\n\n0.25\n0.2\n0.15\n\n\u278c\n\n0.1 \u03b3\u03b3\n\nATLAS+CMS\n\n0.05\n0\n\n125 150 175 200 225 250 275 300 325 350\n\nHiggs mass [GeV/c2]\nFIG. 32: Expected SM Higgs mass precision at LHC (for CMS; ATLAS will be slightly different\nbut comparable) and a future ILC, as a function of Higgs mass [78].\nB.\n\nSpin & CP measurement\n\nSpin and CP (J P C ) experimental measurements are linked, because both require angular\ndistributions to obtain. Numerous techniques have been proposed to address this, with\nsignificant overlap but also some unique features with each method. I'll highlight the leading\nproposals which garner the most attention from LHC experimentalists today.\nFrom the observed final state we can tell that the Higgs candidate is a boson. We'll\nstart by assuming that it may be spin 0, 1 or 2, but no higher10 . Then we recall that the\nYang-Landau Theorem [80] forbids a coupling between three S = 1 bosons if two of them\nare identical. Thus, if we observe \u03c6 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3, then our new object cannot be spin-1, and C = 1.\nFor the very curious student who wants to delve deeper, there is a recent report on CP Higgs\nstudies at colliders [81].\n1.\n\nNelson technique\n\nThe first method is the oldest, developed by Nelson [82]. It assumes the object is a scalar\nor pseudoscalar11 and relies on the decay angular distributions to a pair of EW gauge bosons,\nwhich decay further. The most practical aspect relevant for LHC Higgs physics is in essence\na measurement of the relative azimuthal angle between the decay planes of two Z bosons in\nturn coming from the scalar decay, in the scalar particle's rest frame. See Fig. 33 for clarity.\nOne bins the data in this distribution and fits to the equation:\nF (\u03c6) = 1 + \u03b1 cos(\u03c6) + \u03b2 cos(2\u03c6)\n10\n11\n\n(12)\n\nS \u2265 3 fundamental particles are believed to have deep problems in renormalizable field theory [79].\nA pseudoscalar doesn't couple at tree-level to W or Z, but can have a (large) loop-induced coupling.\n\n35\n\n\fFor a scalar, such as the SM Higgs, the coefficients \u03b1 and \u03b2 are functions of the scalar mass,\nand further we have the constraint that \u03b1(M\u03c6 ) > 14 . In contrast, for a pseudoscalar, \u03b1 = 0\nand \u03b2 = \u22120.25, independent of the mass.\nRef. [83] was the first to apply this to the LHC Higgs physics program using detector\nsimulation. Assuming 100 fb\u22121 of data, the study found that LHC could readily distinguish\na SM Higgs from a pseudoscalar for MH > 200 GeV, and from a spin-1 boson of either CP\nstate from a little above that, but not right at 200 GeV; see Fig. 34. Applying this technique\nto MH < 200 but above ZZ threshold was not examined.\nAs a practical matter, H \u2192 ZZ (\u2217) observation is assured only for both Z bosons decaying\nto leptons (e or \u03bc), where there is essentially zero background. Unfortunately, this is an\nextremely tiny branching ratio, only 0.05% of all H \u2192 ZZ events. Some studies consider\njjl+ l\u2212 channels, which is a ten-times larger sample, in an attempt to increase statistics, but\nthis suffers from non-trivial QCD backgrounds.\ne+\n\n11111\n00000\n\n\u03961\n\n\u03bc\u2212\n\n\u03c6\n\n\u03b82\n0000\n1111\n\n\u03962\n\n\u03b81\n\n\u03bc+\n\ne\u2212\n\nFIG. 33: Schematic of the azimuthal angle between the decay planes of Z bosons arising from\nmassive scalar decay.

[84] provides an extension to the Nelson technique below ZZ threshold. Its full\nanalysis is far more in-depth, discussing the angular behavior of the matrix elements for\narbitrary boson spin and parity. It first demonstrates how objects of odd normality (spin\ntimes parity) can be discriminated via angular distributions, but for even normality require\na further discriminant. That is, a J P = 2+ boson could mimic a SM Higgs in angular\ndistribution below ZZ threshold. (Exotic higher spin states can be trivially ruled out via\nthe lack of angular correlation between the beam and the object's flight direction.)\nThe key discriminant is the differential partial decay rate for the off-shell Z boson12 . It\ndepends on the invariant mass of the final-state lepton pair and is linear in Z \u2217 velocity:\np\nd\u0393H\n(MH \u2212 MZ )2 \u2212 M\u22172\n(13)\n\u223c\n\u03b2\n\u223c\ndM\u22172\nFig. 35 shows the predicted distributions for 150 GeV spin-0,1,2 even-normality objects as a\nfunction of M\u2217 , the off-shellness of the Z \u2217 l+ l\u2212 .

Unfortunately\nthere\n\u221a are no error bars, although one can estimate the statistical uncertainty for each bin\nas N and observe that the measurement is likely not spectacular. We can expect that\nCMS and ATLAS will eventually get around to quantifying the discriminating power, but it\nwould not be surprising to learn that this measurement requires far more data, e.g. at the\nupgraded SLHC [70].\n30\n\u2013\n\n\u2013\n\nH \u2192 Z Z \u2192 (f1f1)(f2f2)\nMH = 150 GeV\n*\n\n25\n\nNo. of Events\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n30\n\nSM\nSpin 1\nSpin 2\n35\n\n40\n\n45\nM* (GeV)\n\n50\n\n55\n\nFIG. 35: Differential decay rate as a function of dilepton invariant mass of the off-shell Z \u2217 in ZZ\nevents, for a 150 GeV SM Higgs v. spin-1 and spin-2 objects of even normality and the same mass.\nThe histogram is the SM Higgs case for 300 fb\u22121 of data at LHC.

Rather than examine Higgs decays, it notes that WBF Higgs production is\nobservable for any Higgs mass, regardless of decay mode. Furthermore, the same HV V\nvertex appears on the production side for all masses, also independent of decay. More\nprecisely, this vertex has the structure g \u03bc\u03bd HV\u03bc V\u03bd (V = W, Z). This tensor structure is not\ngauge invariant by itself. It must come from a gauge-invariant kinetic term (D\u03bc \u03a6)\u2020 (D \u03bc \u03a6).\nIdentifying it in experiment would go a long way to establishing that the scalar field is a\nremnant of spontaneous symmetry breaking.\nFor a scalar field which couples via higher-dimensional operators to two gauge bosons,\nhowever, we may write down the CP-even and CP-odd gauge-invariant D6 operators [86]:\ng2\ng2\n\u2020\n+\n\u2212\u03bc\u03bd\nf + W \u2212\u03bc\u03bd\nL6 =\n(\u03a6 \u03a6)W\u03bc\u03bd W\n+\n(\u03a6\u2020 \u03a6)W\n\u03bc\u03bd\n2\u039b6,e\n2\u039b6,o\n\n(14)\n\nwhere \u039b6 is the scale of new physics that is integrated out, W \u03bc\u03bd is the W boson field strength\nf = \u01eb\u03b1\u03b2\u03bc\u03bd W \u03b1\u03b2 is its dual. After expanding \u03a6 with a vev and radial excitation,\ntensor, and W\nwe obtain two D5 operators:\nL5 =\n\n1\n1\n+\nf + W \u2212\u03bc\u03bd\nHW\u03bc\u03bd\nW \u2212\u03bc\u03bd +\nHW\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u039b5,e\n\u039b5,o\n\n(15)\n\nwhere \u039b5 are dimensionful but now parameterize both the D6 coefficients and the \u03a6 vev.\nThese two D5 operators produce very distinctive matrix element behavior. Recalling\nthat the external gauge bosons in WBF are actually virtual and connect to external fermion\ncurrents, the initial-state scattered quarks, we derive the following approximate relations for\nthe CP-even operator, using J1,2 for the incoming fermion currents:\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1 \u03bc \u03bd\n1\nMe,5 \u221d\nJ1 J2 g\u03bc\u03bd (q1 * q2 ) \u2212 q1,\u03bd q2,\u03bc \u223c\n[J10 J20 \u2212 J13 J23 ] p~Tj1 * p~Tj2\n(16)\n\u039be,5\n\u039be,5\nThat is, the amplitude is proportional to the tagging jets' transverse momentum dot product.\nThis is easy to measure experimentally \u2013 we just plot the azimuthal angular distribution, i.e.\nangular separation in the plane perpendicular to the beam. It will be minimal, nearly zero,\nfor \u03c6jj = \u03c0/4. In contrast, the g \u03bc\u03bd tensor structure of the SM Higgs mechanism does not\ncorrelate the tagging jets. The CP-odd D5 operator is different and more complex, but may\nbe understood by noting that it contains a Levi-Civita tensor \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03b4 connecting the external\nfermion momenta. This is non-zero only when the four external momenta are independent,\ni.e. not coplanar. Thus this distribution will be zero for \u03c6jj = 0, \u03c0.\nFig. 36 shows the results of a parton-level simulation for scalars in both the mass range\nwhere decays to taus would be used, and where \u03c6 \u2192 W + W \u2212 dominates. The SM signal curve\nis not entirely flat due to kinematic cuts imposed on the final state to ID all objects. The\nD5 operators produce behavior qualitatively distinct from spontaneous symmetry breaking,\nwith minima for the distributions exactly where expected, and orthogonal from each other.\nIt would be essentially trivial to distinguish the cases from each other shortly after discovery,\nregardless of MH and the particular channel used to discover the Higgs candidate. A key\nrequirement for this, of course, is that the discovery searches don't use this distribution to\nseparate signal from background.\n38\n\n\f0.006\n\nd\u03c3/d\u2206\u03a6jj (h\u2192\u03c4\u03c4) [fb]\n\n1/\u03c3tot d\u03c3/d\u2206\u03a6jj (H\u2192WW)\n\nMh=120 GeV\n\nmH=160 GeV\n\nCP odd\n\n0.01\n\nCP odd\n\n0.004\nSM\n\nSM\n0.005\n\n0.002\n\nCP even\n\nCP even\nZ\u2192\u03c4\u03c4\n\n0\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n0\n\u2206\u03a6jj\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n\u2206\u03a6jj\n\nFIG. 36: Azimuthal angular distributions of the tagging jets in WBF production of a SM Higgs\nv. scalar field coupled to weak bosons via CP-even/odd D6 operators.

[85].\n\nNow, what happens if the Higgs indeed arises from SSB, but new physics generates sizable\nD6 operators? Since HSM is CP-even, a CP-even D5 operator would interfere with the SM\namplitude, while a CP-odd contribution would remain independent. This is illustrated in\nthe left panel of Fig. 37. The obvious thing to do is create an asymmetry observable sensitive\nto this interference:\n\u03c3(\u2206\u03c6jj < \u03c0/2) \u2212 \u03c3(\u2206\u03c6jj > \u03c0/2)\n(17)\nA\u03c6 =\n\u03c3(\u2206\u03c6jj < \u03c0/2) + \u03c3(\u2206\u03c6jj > \u03c0/2)\nWith only 100 fb\u22121 of data at LHC (one experiment), this asymmetry would have access\nto \u039b6 \u223c 1 TeV, which is itself within the reach of LHC, likely resulting in new physics\nobservation directly.

J P C can in fact be determined completely model-independently. Recalling the LEP search, the canonical production\nmechanism is e+ e\u2212 \u2192 ZH. We would identify the Z via its decay to leptons, and sum over\nall Higgs decays (this is possible using the recoil mass technique, coming up in Sec. III D).\nJ and P are completely determined by a combination of the cross section rise at threshold\nand the polar angle of the Z flight direction in the lab, shown in the left panel of Fig. 38.\nThe differential cross section is [71]:\n\u0002\n\u0003\nd\u03c3\n\u221d \u03b2 1 + a\u03b2 2 sin2 \u03b8Z + b\u03b7\u03b2 cos \u03b8Z + \u03b7 2 \u03b2 2 (1 + cos2 \u03b8Z )\nd cos \u03b8Z\n\n(18)\n\nwhere a and b depend on the EW couplings and Z boson mass, \u03b7 is a general pseudoscalar\n(loop-induced) coupling and \u03b2 is the velocity. Far more sophisticated analyses techniques\nexist, often called \"optimal observable\" analyses [87], but are only for the terminally curious.\nIf one would have the liberty to perform a threshold scan of Z\u03c6 production at an ILC,\ndistinguishing given-normality J = 0, 1, 2 states is straightforward due to their different\n\u03b2-dependence. For J = 0 it is linear, but for higher spin is higher-power in \u03b2 [88]. The\nqualitative behavior is shown in the right panel of Fig. 38, complete with error bars for the\nSM Higgs case. However, while the physics is solid, experiments in the past have generally\nproved to be a horse race for highest energy, so there is no guarantee that one would have\nthreshold scan data available. The angular distribution fortunately works at all energies.\n\nf\n\n(a)\n\ne+\nZ\u0003\n\n(b)\n\nH\n\nf\nZ\n#\n\ne\n\n15\ncross section (fb)\n\ne\n\nf\u0016\n\nZ\n\n#\u0003\n\nJ=0\n\n10\n\nJ=1\nJ=2\n\n5\n\nf\u0016\ne+\n\n0\n210\n\nH\n\n220\n\n230\n\n240\n\n250\n\ns (GeV)\n\nFIG. 38: Left: Feynman diagram for e+ e\u2212 \u2192 ZH and schematic [88] showing the analyzing angles.\nRight: curves showing the threshold rate dependence for J = 0, 1, 2 states in this channel [71].\n\n40\n\n\fC.\n\nHiggs couplings at LHC\n\nNow to something much harder. It's commonly believed that LHC cannot measure Higgs\ncouplings, only ratios of BRs [42]. This is incorrect, but requires a little explanation to\nunderstand why people previously believed in a limitation.\nFirst, let me state that the LHC doesn't measure couplings or any other quantum number\ndirectly. It measures rates. (This is true for any particle physics experiment.) From those\nwe extract various \u03c3i * BRj by removing detector, soft QCD and phase space effects, among\nother things, using Monte Carlo simulations based on known physics inputs.\nSecond, we note that for a light Higgs, which has a very small width (cf. Sec. II A 1), the\nHiggs production cross section is proportional to the partial width for Higgs decay to the\ninitial state (the Narrow Width Approximation, NWA). That is, \u03c3gg\u2192H \u221d \u0393H\u2192gg . Similarly,\n\u03c3WBF \u221d \u0393H\u2192W + W \u2212 . The student who has never seen this may easily derive it by recalling\nthe definition of cross section and partial decay width \u2013 they share the same matrix elements\nand differ only by phase space factors13 . Typically we abbreviate these partial widths with\na subscript identifying the final state particle, thus we have \u0393g , \u0393\u03b3 , \u0393b , etc. Since a BR is\njust the partial decay width over the total width, we then write:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0001\n\u0393p \u0393d\n\u03c3H * BR i \u221d\n(19)\n\u0393H i\nwhere \u0393p and \u0393d are the \"production\" and decay widths, respectively.\nThird, count up the number of observables we have and measurements we can make.\nAssuming we have a decay channel for each possible Higgs decay (which we don't), we're\nstill one short: \u0393H , the total width. Now, if the width is large enough, larger than detector\nresolution, we can measure it directly. Fig. 39 shows that this can happen only for MH &\n230 GeV or so [42], far above where EW precision data suggests we'll find the (SM) Higgs.\nBelow this mass range, we have to think of something else.\n\u2206\u0393H/\u0393H\n\nHiggs Width [GeV]\n\n100\n10\n\n1\n\n1\n10\n\n-1\n\n0.1\n\n0.01\n0.001\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\nHiggs Mass [GeV/c 2 ]\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\nmH (GeV)\n\nFIG. 39: Left: Standard Model Higgs total width as a function of MH .

For the\nmoment let's assume we have access to all possible decays or partial widths via production,\nignore the super-rare decay modes to first- and second-generation fermions. This is a mild\nassumption, because if for some reason the muon or electron Yukawa were anywhere close\nto that of taus, where it might contribute to the total width, it would immediately be\nobservable. The list of possible measurements we can form from accessible (\u03c3 * BR)i,exp is:\nX\u03b3 , X\u03c4 , XW , XZ , Y \u03b3 , Y W , Y Z , Z b , Z \u03b3 , Z W\n\n(20)\n\nwhere Xi correspond to WBF channels, Yi are inclusive Higgs production, and Zi are top\nquark associated production14 . We could easily add measurements like X\u03bc , Ye , etc. if we\nwanted, because measuring zero for any observable is still a measurement \u2013 it simply places\na constraint on that combination of partial widths or couplings.\nIn the original implementation of this idea [89], the authors noted that the tt\u0304H, H \u2192 bb\u0304\nchannel won't work, so there is no access at LHC to \u0393b . However, there is access to \u0393\u03c4 . In the\nSM, the b and \u03c4 Yukawa couplings are related by rb = \u0393b /\u0393\u03c4 = 3cQCD m2b /m2\u03c4 , where cQCD\ncontains QCD higher-order corrections and phase space effects. \u0393W and \u0393Z are furthermore\nrelated by SU(2)L , although we don't need to use it. Now write down the derived quantity\n\u0012X \u0013\n\u0393W\ne\ne\n\u0393W = X\u03c4 (1 + rb ) + XW + XZ + X\u03b3 + Xg =\n\u0393i\n= (1 \u2212 \u01eb)\u0393W\n(21)\n\u0393H\n\neg is constructed from XW , X\u03b3 , YW and Y\u03b3 . Although \u0393\u03b3 is an infinitesimal contriwhere X\nbution to \u0393H , it is important as above, and it contains both the top quark Yukawa and W\ngauge-Higgs couplings. Our error is contained in \u01eb and is typically small. This provides a\ngood lower bound on \u0393W from data. The total width is then\n\u0393H =\n\ne2\n\u0393\nW\nXW\n\n(22)\n\nand the error goes as (1 \u2212 \u01eb)\u22122 . Assuming systematic uncertainties of 5% on WBF and 20%\non inclusive production, this would achieve about a 10% measurement of \u0393W and 10 \u2212 20%\non the total width for MH < 200 GeV.\nVoil\u00e0! We have circumvented the na\u0131\u0308ve problem of not enough independent measurements. The astute observer should immediately protest, however, and rightly so. The result\nis achieved with a little too much confidence that the SM is correct. Not only does the trick\nrely on a very strong assumption about the b Yukawa coupling, but there could be funny\nbusiness in the up-quark sector, giving a large partial width to e.g. charm quarks, which\nwould not be observable either via production (too little initial-state charm, and anyhow\nunidentifiable) or decay (charm can't be efficiently tagged). Nevertheless, this was a useful\nexercise, because a much more rigorous, model-independent method is closely based on it.\nThe more sophisticated method is a powerful least-likelihood fit to data using a more\naccurate relation than Eq. 19 between data and theory [90]:\n\u03c3H * BR(H \u2192 xx) =\n14\n\nSM\n\u03c3H\n*\n\u0393SM\np\n\n\u0393p \u0393d\n\u0393H\n\n(23)\n\nFor this case, we actually use the Yukawa coupling squared (yt2 ) instead of \u0393t , because decays to top\nquarks is kinematically forbidden. But this is irrelevant for our argument.\n\n42\n\n\f1\n\n\u2206 g2(H,X)\ng2(H,X)\n\n\u2206 g2(H,X)\ng2(H,X)\n\nwhere the partial widths in the box are the true values to be extracted from data, and the\n(\u03c3/\u0393)SM ratio in front quantifies all effects shoved into Monte Carlo using SM values: phase\nspace, QCD corrections, detector, etc. As before, the \"sum\" of all channels provides a solid\nlower bound on \u0393H , simply because some rate in each of a number of channels requires\nsome minimum coupling. But these are found by a fit, rather than theory assumptions.\nIt also properly takes into account all theory and experimental systematic and statistical\nuncertainties assigned to each channel. We then need only a firm upper bound on \u0393H and\nthe fit then extracts absolute couplings (transformed from the partial widths). This bound\ncomes from unitarity: the gauge-Higgs coupling can be depressed via mixing in any multidoublet model, as well as any number of additional singlets, but it cannot exceed the SM\nvalue, which is strictly defined by unitarity. Thus \u0393V \u2264 \u0393SM\nV . (This bound is invalid in\ntriplet models, but these have other characteristics which should make themselves apparent\nin experiment.) The WBF H \u2192 W + W \u2212 channel then provides an upper limit on \u0393H via\nits measurement of \u03932V /\u0393H .\nThe method can be further armored against BSM alterations by including the invisible\nHiggs channel, allowing additional loop contributions, and so on. Of course, the more\npossible deviations one allows, the larger the fit uncertainties become. We see this in the\ndifferences between the left and right panels of Fig. 40 [90]. It is obvious that LHC's weakness\nis lack of access to H \u2192 bb\u0304. Nevertheless, LHC can measure absolute Higgs couplings with\nuseful constraints on BSM physics. This is especially true for MH & 150 GeV, where LHC\ncan achieve O(10%) precision on the gauge-Higgs couplings and the total width.\ng2(H,Z)\n2\n\n0.9\n\ng (H,W)\ng2(H,\u03c4)\n\n1\n0.9\n\n0.8\n\ng2(H,b)\n\n0.8\n\n0.7\n\ng2(H,t)\n\u0393H\n\n0.7\n\nwithout Syst. uncertainty\n\n0.6\n0.5\n\nWBF: 2*100 fb\n\ng2(H,b)\ng2(H,t)\n\u0393H\nwithout Syst. uncertainty\n\n0.6\n\n2 Experiments\n\n\u222b L dt=2*300 fb\n\ng2(H,\u03c4)\n\n-1\n\n0.5\n\n-1\n\n2 Experiments\n\n\u222b L dt=2*300 fb\nWBF: 2*100 fb\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\n-1\n-1\n\n0\n110 120 130 140 150 160 170 180 190\nmH [GeV]\n\n110 120 130 140 150 160 170 180 190\nmH [GeV]\n\nFIG. 40: Left: a least likelihood general fit on simulated LHC data, with no additional assumptions\nabout the Higgs sector. Right: the fit assuming no new particles appear in Higgs loop-induced\ndecays, and the gauge-Higgs coupling fixed exactly to the SM value. Figures from Ref. [90].\n\n43\n\n\fThe fit as implemented in Ref. [90] fixes MH . This is a slight cheat, since for some MH the\nBRs change quite rapidly, and a 1-2 GeV uncertainty can lead to a lot of slop in the coupling\nextraction. This is especially critical for the Higgs sector of the Minimal Supersymmetric\nStandard Model (MSSM). Eventually a fit to MH will also have to be included, which will\ndegrade measurement precision somewhat.\nAt the same time, there is cause for optimism. The results of Fig. 40 were based on\nvery conservative, almost pessimistic assumptions: overly-large systematic errors, WBF not\nbeing possible at all at high-luminosity running, no minijet veto for WBF (cf. Sec. II C 3),\nand lack of progress in higher-order QCD calculations for signals and backgrounds. The\nreality is that significant progress has been made regarding QCD corrections, and we'll see\none example shortly. Also, everyone knows that the minijet veto is a qualitatively correct\naspect of the physics, we just can't accurately predict its impact. Early LHC data from Zjj\nproduction should take care of this. Furthermore, ATLAS and CMS experimentalists fully\nexpect WBF to work at high-luminosity LHC running, they just don't have full simulation\nresults for the probable efficiencies. Also, we may expect far better performance in the WBF\nH \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 channels as discussed in Sec. II C 4. Finally, if new physics exists up to a few\nTeV, it will be observable and we can take it into accounts in Higgs loop-induced decays.\nNow to QCD corrections. Ref. [90] used large QCD uncertainties for \u03c3gg\u2192H and \u0393g , 20%\neach, which is the correct NNLO uncertainty for each by itself. However, these two quantities\nappear as a ratio in our observables formula, Eq. 23. As pointed out in Ref. [91], most of\nthese uncertainties drop out in the ratio. The reason for this is that the QCD corrections\nto the cross section and partial width are largely the same:\n\u0393 \u223c \u03b1s2 (\u03bcR )C12 (\u03bcR )[1 + \u03b1s (\u03bcR )X1 + ...]\n\u03c3 \u223c \u03b1s2 (\u03bcR )C12 (\u03bcR )[1 + \u03b1s (\u03bcR )Y1 + ...]\n\n(24)\n(25)\n\nThe correct uncertainty on the ratio is 5%, which will have an enormous impact on the fits\nof Fig. 40. We eagerly await new results from this and other improvements!\nD.\n\nHiggs couplings at an ILC\n\nMeasuring Higgs couplings at an e+ e\u2212 collider would be far more straightforward and\nrely on far fewer theoretical assumptions. Between that and being a colorless collision\nenvironment, it would also involve far fewer systematic uncertainties. I'll outline the basic\nidea.\nIn fixed-beam collisions it's possible to measure the total ZH production rate. To see\nthis, we just apply a little relativistic kinematics, rewriting the invariant MH2 :\n\u221a\nMH2 = p2H = (p+ + p\u2212 \u2212 pZ )2 = s + MZ2 \u2212 2EZ s\n(26)\nWe see that observing the Higgs and measuring its total rate boils down to observing Z\nbosons via their extremely sharp dimuon peak and plotting this recoil mass. Fig. 41 shows\nwhat the resulting event rate looks like in this distribution. The Higgs peak is clearly visible\nand sidebands allow one to subtract the SM background in the signal region. This captures\nall possible Higgs decays, even though that aren't taggable or even identifiable, simply by\nignoring everything in the event except for the Z dimuons.\nSimulations [71] suggest that the recoil mass technique would allow for about a 2.5%\nabsolute measurement of the ZH rate. Since the cross section depends on the Z\u2013Higgs\ncoupling squared, the coupling uncertainty is then about a percent.\n44\n\n\fNumber of Events / 1.5 GeV\n\nData\nZ h \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc X\n\n200\n\nM h = 120 GeV\n\n100\n\n0\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\nRecoil Mass [GeV]\nFIG. 41: Event rate of the recoil mass for e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 +X at a future high-energy linear collider.\nZH production will fall into this sample, but the Higgs decays are ignored, thus capturing the total\nHiggs production rate. (Figure modified from Ref. [92] for a public talk by one of the authors.)\n\nGetting from this one coupling and the total rate to any other coupling is formulaic:\n1. In the total rate, measure the best branching ratios, whatever they may be. Depending\non the mass and detector performance, that's likely one of bb\u0304, \u03b3\u03b3 or W + W \u2212 decays.\n2. Now look in WBF Higgs production15 with the Higgs decaying to the same best final\nstate. This yields the partial width \u0393W .\n3. Calculate the total Higgs width as \u0393W /BR(H \u2192 W + W \u2212 ).\n\n4. Any other measured BR now gives that individual partial width, therefore the relevant\ncoupling (or couplings for some loop-induced decays).\n\nTable II enumerates the results of ILC simulation for select MH [93]. (Clearly more thorough\nwork should be done here.) There are a few noteworthy features. First, H \u2192 bb\u0304 would be\naccessible even as a rare BR at larger MH , due to the nearly QCD-free collision environment.\nSecond, a weak measurement of H \u2192 cc\u0304 should be possible, for the same reason, and due to\nthe superior b v. c resolution of the next generation of collider detectors. Third, H \u2192 jj is\nalso accessible. This would be attributed to gg, which is a mild theoretical assumption. It is\nin principle sanity-checkable by the absence of an anomalous high-x Higgs production rate\nat LHC, which would come from sea or valence quarks and a non-SM coupling to lighter\nfermions (which would be difficult to accommodate theoretically, so not expected).\n15\n\nFor a linear collider this is both e+ e\u2212 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 H and e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bd \u03bd\u0304H, since e and \u03bd are distinguishable.\nExperimentally they become two different analyses.\n\n45\n\n\fMH (GeV)\nDecay\nbb\u0304\ncc\u0304\n+\n\u03c4 \u03c4\u2212\ngg\n+\nW W\u2212\nZZ\n\u03b3\u03b3\nZ\u03b3\n\n120 140 160 180 200 220\nRelative precision on \u0393i (%)\n1.9 2.6 6.5 12.0 17.0 28.0\n8.1 19.0\n5.0 8.0\n4.8 14.0\n3.6 2.5 2.1\n16.9\n23.0\n27.0\n\nTABLE II: Estimated precision on various SM Higgs partial widths for a few select values of MH ,\nfrom measurements at a future e+ e\u2212 collider [93].\n\nH \u2192 bb semilep; \u2206\u03c3 /\u03c3\neff\n\neff\n\nBG\n\nBG\n\nH \u2192 bb semilep; \u2206\u03c3 /\u03c3\neff\n\neff\n\nBG\n\nBG\n\nH \u2192 bb hadro; \u2206\u03c3 /\u03c3\neff\n\neff\n\nBG\n\nBG\n\nH \u2192 bb hadro; \u2206\u03c3 /\u03c3\neff\n\neff\n\nBG\n\nBG\n\n\u2206gtth/gtth (%)\n\nBut what about the top Yukawa coupling? Its anticipated value of approximately one is\ncurious enough to warrant special attention. A light Higgs can't decay to top quark pairs, so\nwe'd have to rely on top quark associated production, as at LHC but without all the nasty\nQCD backgrounds. However, the event rate is far lower than at LHC and would require\nan 800 GeV machine collecting 1000 fb\u22121 [94], the planned lifetime of a next-generation\nsecond-stage machine (justifying my previous statement about the drive to go to maximum\nenergy and sit there). One study combined expected LHC and ILC results [73, 95], and\nthere are more recent results for ILC, summarized in Fig. 42 [96].

They\nuse a more complicated \"optimal observables\" (detailed kinematic shape information, for\nexample) scheme. It's more powerful, but doesn't lend itself to the simplistic formulaic\napproach I just discussed.\nI should emphasize that the results I reviewed are relevant only for the Standard Model.\nIf the Higgs sector is non-minimal, or any new physics appears at the weak scale, it could\nresult in altered couplings (and usually does; see Chapter IV). If they're suppressed, the\nevent rate goes down, resulting in greater uncertainty. This is often glossed over or ignored\nin discussions of Higgs phenomenology, but is a potential reality and something we'd just\nhave to lump. Nevertheless, it should be clear by now that an ILC would be a spectacular\nexperiment for precision Higgs measurements.\nE.\n\nHiggs potential\n\nFinally we arrive at the most difficult Higgs property to test, the potential. This is the\nhallmark of spontaneous symmetry breaking, thus ranks at least as high in priority as finding\nYukawa couplings proportional to fermion masses. To see what's involved, let's review the\nSM Higgs potential. The potential is normally written as:\nV (\u03a6) = \u03bc2 \u03a6\u2020 \u03a6 + \u03bb(\u03a6\u2020 \u03a6)2\n\n(27)\n\nwhere \u03a6 is our SU(2)L complex doublet of scalar fields. The Higgs spontaneous symmetry2\nbreaking mechanism is what\np happens to the Lagrangian when \u03bc < 0 and the field's global\n2\nminimum shifts to v = \u2212\u03bc /\u03bb. We then expand \u03a6 \u2192 v + H(x) (ignoring the Goldstone\nmodes which you learned about in Sally Dawson's lectures) where H(x) is the radial excitation, the physical Higgs boson. The Higgs mass squared is then 2v 2\u03bb, and is the only free\nparameter, although constrained (weakly) by EW precision fits. The student performing this\nexpansion will also notice HHH and HHHH Lagrangian terms, which are self-interactions\nof the Higgs boson. The three- and four-point couplings are \u22126v\u03bb and \u22126\u03bb, respectively16 .\nTo measure the potential is to measure these self-couplings and check their relation to\nthe measured Higgs mass. Our phenomenological approach is to rewire the Higgs potential\nin terms of independent parameters and the Higgs candidate field \u03b7H :\nV (\u03b7H ) =\n\n1 2 2\n1e 4\n3\nMH \u03b7H + \u03bb v \u03b7H\n+ \u03bb\n\u03b7\n2\n4 H\n\n(28)\n\ne are now free parameters, which we measure from the direct production rate of HH\n\u03bb and \u03bb\nand HHH events. This will ultimately be a voyage of frustration.\n1.\n\nHH production at LHC\n\nWe begin with Higgs pairs at LHC. The dominant production mechanism is gluon fusion,\ngg \u2192 HH [97, 98, 99]. The Feynman diagrams are shown in Fig. 43. The first diagram\nis off-shell single Higgs production which split via the three-point self-coupling to a pair of\non-shell Higgses, which then decay promptly. The second diagram is a box (four-point)\n16\n\nDon't forget the identical-particle combinatorial factors.\n\n47\n\n\fg\n\nh\n\nt\nh\n\nt\n\nt\n\nt\n\ng\n\nt\n\ng\n\nh\n\nh\nt\n\ng\n\nh\nt\n\nFIG. 43: Feynman diagrams for the dominant Higgs pair production rate at LHC, gg \u2192 HH.\n100\nSM: pp \u2192 hh +X\nLHC: \u03c3 [fb]\n\ngg \u2192 hh\n10\nWW+ZZ \u2192 hh\nWhh+Zhh\n\n1\nWhh:Zhh \u2248 1.6\nWW:ZZ \u2248 2.3\n0.1\n90\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\n180 190\nMh[GeV]\n\nFIG. 44: Left: Higgs pair production cross sections at LHC as a function of MH [100].

Right: Higgs pair branching ratios as a function of MH , calculated using hdecay [22].\n\nloop contribution which involves only the top quark Yukawa coupling. Interestingly, the two\ndiagrams interfere destructively and have a rather large cancellation. This means the rate is\nsmall [100], as shown in Fig. 44, making our life difficult with a small statistical sample. On\nthe other hand, the destructive interference will turn out to be crucial to making constructive\nstatements about the self-coupling \u03bb.\nThe left panel of Fig. 44 tells us that we can expect O(10k) light Higgs pair events per\ndetector over the expected 300 fb\u22121 lifetime of the first LHC run, and ten times that at\nSLHC. That sounds like a lot, but keep in mind that both Higgses have to decay to a final\nstate we can observe, which will reduce the captured rate to something much smaller. Then\nwe have to consider what backgrounds affect each candidate channel.\nThe right panel of Fig. 44 shows selected Higgs pair branching ratios. At low mass,\ndecays to b pairs dominate, as expected, while for MH & 135 GeV mass it's W pairs. We\ncan immediately discount the 4b final state as hopeless, based on what we already learned\nabout QCD backgrounds \u2013 but 4W is promising for higher masses. The next-largest mode\nfrom those two is bb\u0304W + W \u2212 , which unfortunately is the same final state as the far larger top\nquark pair cross section. A few minutes' investigation causes this to be discarded, even after\ntrying various invariant mass constraints; b pair mass resolution is just not good enough.\nThe bb\u0304\u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 mode has very low backgrounds, comparable to the signal, but suffers hugely\nfrom lack of statistics, due to low efficiency for subsequent tau decays. However, the rare\ndecay mode bb\u0304\u03b3\u03b3 is extremely clean and worth further consideration at low masses.\n48\n\n\fHH \u2192 W + W \u2212 W + W \u2212 at LHC\n\nHH \u2192 W + W \u2212 W + W \u2212 has myriad decays, but for triggering purposes and to get away\nfrom QCD background sources of leptons (like top quarks) we need to select special multilepton final states [101]. The most likely accessible channels are same-sign lepton pairs,\nl\u00b1 l\u00b1 +4j, and three leptons, l+ l\u2212 l\u00b1 +2j, since the principal QCD SM backgrounds can't easily mimic them. Note that because of multiple neutrinos departing the detector unobserved,\ncomplete reconstruction is not possible. The principle backgrounds are W W W jj, tt\u0304W , tt\u0304j,\ntt\u0304Z/\u03b3 \u2217 and W Z + 4j, but we also need to consider tt\u0304tt\u0304, 4W , W + W \u2212 + 4j, W + W \u2212 Zjj as\nwell as double parton scattering and overlapping events. The calculation of all of these is\ntechnical so I won't go into it, rather simply mention a few noteworthy points.\nThe first is a warning about using the gg \u2192 HH effective\u221aLagrangian in practical calculations. It is still a mystery why the leading term in the \u015d/mt expansion [97] should\nget the overall rate so close that of an exact calculation [98], but it does. Because of that,\nnobody has ever bothered to calculate higher-order terms in the effective Lagrangian expansion; in any case, the exact results are available, as well as NLO in QCD [99]. However,\nthe leading terms in the expansion cancel too much close to threshold, yielding incorrect\nkinematics [101], as can be seen from Fig. 45. One should thus use only the exact matrix\nelement results for practical gg \u2192 HH phenomenology.\nThe second point is that our main systematic uncertainties will be our limited knowledge\nof the top quark Yukawa coupling, which drives the production rate, and the BR to W + W \u2212 ,\nwhich drive the decay fraction. These must be known very precisely for any measurement\nto be useful.\n\nFIG. 45: Differential cross section as a function of the minimum jet pair lego plot separation for\nl+ l\u2212 + 4j at events at LHC. The solid curve is the correct distribution using exact matrix elements\nfor HH, while the dash-dotted curve comes from effective-Lagrangian matrix elements where the\ntop quark mass is taken to infinity. Figure taken from Ref. [101].\n\n49\n\n\fWe will need a discriminating observable to separate signal from background. We can\nspeculate that nearly all the signal's kinematic information is encoded in the invariant mass\nof the visible final state particles, so let's construct a new variable, mvis :\n\"\n#2 \"\n#2\nX\nX\nm2vis =\nEi \u2212\npi\n(29)\ni\n\ni\n\nwhere i are all the leptons and jets in the event. We suspect a difference because the signal is\na two-body process, which is threshold-like, while the backgrounds are multi-body processes\nwhich peak at much larger mvis than the sum of their heavy resonances' masses.\nFig. 46 displays the fruits of parameterizing our ignorance (or rather, the detector's). The\nseparation between signal and background is exactly as expected: the signal peaks much\nlower, allowing a \u03c72 fit to distinguish it from the backgrounds. But the plot also reveals\na saving grace in the destructive interference between triangle and box loop diagrams. If\nspontaneous symmetry breaking isn't the right description and there is no Higgs potential,\nthen \u03bb = 0 and the lack of destructive interference gives a wildly larger signal cross section,\nwhich is far easier to observe.\nFig. 47 summarizes the results of Ref. [101]. It plots 95% CL limits on the shifted selfcoupling, \u25b3\u03bb = (\u03bb \u2212 \u03bbSM )/\u03bbSM . This is somewhat easier to understand: zero is the SM,\nand -1 corresponds to no self-coupling, or no potential. For MH > 150 GeV, the LHC can\nexclude \u03bb = 0 at (for some MH much greater than) 2\u03c3 with only the LHC. After SLHC\nrunning, this becomes a 20\u221230% measurement, if other systematics are under control. Here,\nthey're assumed to be smaller than the statistical uncertainty.\n\nFIG. 46: Visible invariant mass distribution for same-sign dilepton plus four jet event at LHC [101].\nAll SM backgrounds are summed into one curve, while the gg \u2192 HH signal is shown separately,\nfor the SM value of self-coupling \u03bb, twice that value, and zero.\n\n50\n\n\fFIG. 47: 95% CL limits achievable at LHC on the shifted Higgs triple self-coupling (see text), \u25b3\u03bb,\nfor LHC and SLHC expected luminosities [101].\n\nAnother potential systematics issue is minimum bias, the presence of extra jets in an\nevent which don't come from the primary hard scattering. Here, they could be confused\nwith jets from the W bosons, causing a distortion of mvis . ATLAS has investigated this and\nfound it to not be a concern \u2013 the shape of mvis for the signal remains largely unaltered [102].\nHH \u2192 bb\u0304\u03b3\u03b3 at LHC\n\nWe've already ruled out as viable the vast majority of Higgs pair BRs for MH . 150 GeV\ndue to QCD backgrounds or too-small efficiencies. However, the rare decay mode to bb\u0304\u03b3\u03b3 is\nworth a closer look [103]. There are many backgrounds to consider, coming from b or c jets\nplus photons, or other jets which fake photons, just as in the single Higgs to photon pairs\ncase. Table III highlights the major ID efficiencies and fake photon rejection factors at LHC\nand SLHC relevant for us. The backgrounds are all calculable at LO, but with significant\nuncertainties, probably a factor of two or more. However, that won't be a concern as we can\nidentify distributions useful for measuring the background in the non-signal region. Note\nthat with this channel we can completely reconstruct both Higgs bosons.\n\u01eb\u03b3\n\nhi\n\u01eb\u03bc Pc\u2192b Pj\u2192b Pj\u2192\u03b3\n\nlo\nPj\u2192\u03b3\n\nLHC 80% 90% 1/13 1/140 1/1600 1/2500\nSLHC 80% 90% 1/13 1/23 1/1600 1/2500\nTABLE III: The major ID efficiencies and fake photon rejection factors at LHC.

Figures from Ref. [103].\n\nThe background QCD uncertainties have a work-around. There are two angular distributions in the lego plot which look very different for the signal, principally because scalars\ndecay isotropically and thus are uncorrelated, while the QCD backgrounds have spin correlations. The two distributions are shown in Fig. 48. The differences are rather dramatic (and\neven more so in 2-D distributions). Tevatron's experiments CDF and D\u00d8 have used such\na pseudo-sideband analysis for some time to measure a background in a non-signal region\nto normalize their Monte Carlo tools, then extrapolating to the signal region to perform\na background subtraction. The technique is viable because QCD radiative corrections in\ngeneral do not significantly alter angular distributions.\nTable IV summarizes the results of Ref. [103]. It gives event rates expected with\n600(6000) fb\u22121 of data (two detectors) at LHC(SLHC). SLHC would not get ten times\nas many events because of lower efficiency of having to tag two b jets instead of only one,\nto overcome the low fake jet rejection rate in a high-luminosity environment. First, note\nthat fake b jets or fake photons are the largest background: the measurement would be\nsignificantly hampered by detector limitations. Second, while the S/B ratio is excellent, the\noverall event rate is extremely small, definitely in the non-Gaussian statistics regime.\nSLHC could make a useful statement about \u03bb, ultimately achieving limits on \u25b3\u03bb of about\n\u00b10.5, but this is not such a strong statement. It could at best generally confirm the SM\npicture of spontaneous symmetry breaking and perhaps rule out wildly different scenarios,\nbut would never be particularly satisfying. On the other hand, it's strong encouragement for\nATLAS and CMS to push the envelope on tagging efficiency and fake rejection, especially\nfor the detector upgrades necessary for SLHC. Doing studies like this well ahead of time is\nuseful for this reason, our present case being a perfect example.\nHH bb\u0304\u03b3\u03b3 cc\u0304\u03b3\u03b3 bb\u0304\u03b3j cc\u0304\u03b3j jj\u03b3\u03b3 bb\u0304jj cc\u0304jj \u03b3jjj jjjj\nLHC\n\n6\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n5\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1\n\nSLHC 21\n\n6\n\n0\n\n4\n\n0\n\n6\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1\n\nP\n\n(bkg) S/B\n11\n\n1/2\n\n20\n\n1/1\n\nTABLE IV: Expected event rates after ID efficiencies and all kinematic cuts for bb\u0304\u03b3\u03b3 events at\nLHC (SLHC), two detectors and 600(6000) fb\u22121 of data [103].

Note the increased fake rate at SLHC.\n\n52\n\n\f2.\n\nHH production at an ILC\n\nWhile (S)LHC clearly has access to Higgs pair production and thus \u03bb for MH > 150 GeV,\nit would disappoint at lower masses. We should see if a future linear collider could also give\na precision measurement for \u03bb as it could for (most) other Higgs couplings.\nFor e+ e\u2212 collisions below about 1 TeV, double Higgsstrahlung is the largest source of\nHiggs pairs. The Feynman diagrams appear in Fig. 49, while the cross sections as a function\nof MH for 500 and 800 GeV collisions [104] are found in Fig. 50, which also shows the cross\nsections times BRs for the dominant final states over the range of Higgs masses. Roughly,\nthis corresponds to 4b and 4W final state. The former is very steeply falling with MH , but\nthe latter is much flatter over the 100\u2013200 GeV mass region, suggesting broader access if at\nall visible.\nThe parton-level studies performed so far [105] are fairly encouraging. As shown in\nFig. 51, an ILC could achieve about a 20 \u2212 30% measurement of \u03bb over a broad mass range,\nwith somewhat worse performance around MH \u223c 140 GeV, where the bb\u0304 and W + W \u2212 BRs\nare roughly equal. Interestingly, for a lower Higgs mass, the analysis prefers lower machine\nenergy, while the opposite is true at least to a small degree at higher mass. This is largely\na phase space effect for the 3-body production mechanism. Also, SLHC is superior for\nMH & 150 GeV (largely due to better statistics), with an important caveat: controlling\nsystematics in gg \u2192 HH \u2192 4W at LHC would require precision input from ILC for the\nHiggs couplings and BRs. This is an excellent example of synergy between experiments.\n\ne+\n\nZ\n\ne\n\nH\n\nZ\nH\nH\n\nZ\n\nZ\nH\nH\n\nZ\n\nZ\nH\nH\n\nFIG. 49: Feynman diagrams for double Higgsstrahlung at a future linear collider, e+ e\u2212 \u2192 HH.\n0.3\nSM Double Higgs-strahlung: e+ e- \u2192 ZHH\n\u03c3 [fb]\n0.2\n\u25cf\n\n\u221as = 800 GeV\n\n\u25cf\n\n\u25cf\n\n0.1\n\n0\n100\n\n\u221as = 500 GeV\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\n180\nMH[GeV]\n\nFIG. 50: Left: the double Higgsstrahlung cross section as a function of MH for 500 and 800 GeV\ne+ e\u2212 collisions [104].

III E 1) at future\ne+ e\u2212 colliders of various energy, as a function of MH [105].\n\nDouble Higgsstrahlung is not the only source of Higgs pairs at an e+ e\u2212 collider, however. In fact, as the energy increases, WBF Higgs pair production becomes more and more\nimportant. Representative Feynman diagrams for e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bd \u03bd\u0304HH are shown in Fig. 52. A\npreliminary analysis [106] for CLIC [107], a second-generation 1 \u2212 5 TeV e+ e\u2212 collider collecting 5000 fb\u22121 , found rather interesting results, summarized graphically in Fig. 53. The\nprincipal finding is that no matter how high the collision energy goes, and regardless of Higgs\nmass, the precision on \u03bb bottoms out at 10 \u2212 15%. This is because the self-coupling has an\ns-channel suppression, and its contributions becomes washed out as by other diagrams as\n\u221a\ns increases. A corollary, though, is that CLIC could potentially achieve better precision\nthan SLHC for larger MH , although this may be marginal. Much more detailed work would\nbe required for both SLHC and CLIC, as well as experience at LHC and SLHC to determine\nits true potential, to make conclusive statements.\n\nFIG. 52: Representative Feynman diagrams for the WBF process e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bd \u03bd\u0304HH.\n\n54\n\n\f1/\u03c3 \u2206\u03c3/\u2206\u03bb\n\n\u03c3 (fb)\n\n1.4\n1.2\n1\n0.8\n\n1.5\n1.4\n1.3\n1.2\n1.1\n1\n\n0.6\n\n0.9\n0.8\n\n0.4\n\n0.7\n0.2\n0\n\n0.6\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n0.5\n\n5\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\u2206 \u03bb / \u03bb / 5 ab-1\n\n\u221a s (TeV)\n\n4\n\n5\n\n\u221a s (TeV)\n\n0.4\n0.35\n0.3\n0.25\n0.2\n0.15\n0.1\n0.05\n0\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\n4.5\n\n5\n\n5.5\n\n\u221a s (TeV)\nFIG. 53: The results of Ref.

[108] calculated the leading 1-loop\ntop quark EW corrections to \u03bbSM . Their principal SM result is:\n\u0014\n\u0015\nMH2\nNC m4t\nef f\n\u03bbHHH =\n1 \u2212 2 2 2 + ...\n(30)\n2v 2\n3\u03c0 v MH\nThe correction is \u221210%(\u22124%) for MH = 120(180) GeV, non-trivial for smaller Higgs masses,\nbut those are excluded in the SM. This correction should obviously be taken into account in\nany future analysis, should the Higgs be found. But it should be clear that neither (S)LHC\nnor ILC will be sensitive to it. Even CLIC would have only marginal sensitivity, and then\nonly for low MH .\nNon-minimal Higgs sectors and new physics effects can tell a very different story, however,\nas we'll see, coming up in Secs. IV A and IV E.\n\n55\n\n\f4.\n\nHHH production anywhere\n\nThe trilinear self-coupling \u03bb is only part of our phenomenological Higgs potential of\nEq. 28, though. We also need to measure e\n\u03bb, the quartic self-coupling. In some sense this is\nequally important to measuring \u03bb. Recall the structure of the Higgs potential: \u03bb allows the\nglobal minimum to be away from zero, but a non-zero (and positive) e\n\u03bb is required to keep\nthe potential bounded from below. We can't really convince ourselves that the potential\nstructure of Eq. 27 is the right picture without a measurement of both these ingredients.\nWe've just seen that probing \u03bb is extremely challenging. Just how difficult is this likely to\ne\nbe for \u03bb?\nFor e+ e\u2212 collisions we already know this is hopeless: the HHH rate is both too low\nand its dependence on e\n\u03bb too weak [104]. However, the situation at (S)LHC was only very\nrecently investigated [109, 110]. The authors calculated the gg \u2192 HHH cross section, which\ninvolves Feynman diagrams like those of Fig. 54. Note the appearance of numerous diagrams\ndependent on the trilinear self-coupling, in addition to diagrams dependent only on yt .\nThe results of the study are shown in Fig. 55, for a 200 TeV VLHC. They're rather\ndeflating because the cross section is miserably small. A challenge to the student: find a\nthree-Higgs BR to a final state that could be observed at a VLHC, where the rate is not\nlaughable. Good luck! In addition, the right panel shows that any variation of the trilinear\ne whose own variation is already\ncoupling \u03bb completely swamps variation of the quartic \u03bb,\ninfinitesimal.\nIn summary, it appears that we will likely never achieve a complete picture of the Higgs\npotential. This of course applies only to the Standard Model. Coming up in Chapter IV\nwe're going to see that for BSM physics the situation is even more discouraging.\ng\n\nt\nt\n\ng\n\nt\n\nt\nt\n\nH\n\ng\n\nH\nH\n\nt\nt\n\nt\ng\n\nH\n\nt\n\ng\n\nH\n\nt\n\nH\nH\n\ng\n\nt\nt\n\nH\n\nH\n\nH\nH\nH\n\ng\n\nt\n\nt\n\nH\nH\nH\n\nH\n\nt\n\ng\n\nFIG. 54: Representative Feynman diagrams for gg \u2192 HHH.\n0.0035\n\n12\n\u03c3(mH)\n\n\u03bb4/\u03bbSM = 0\n\u03bb4/\u03bbSM = 1\n\u03bb4/\u03bbSM = 2\n\n0.0025\n1/\u03c3tot d\u03c3/dMinv\n\n8\n\u03c3 [fb]\n\n\u03bb3/\u03bbSM = 0\n\n0.003\n\n10\n\n6\n4\n\n\u03bb3/\u03bbSM = 1\n\n0.002\n\n\u03bb3/\u03bbSM = 2\n\n0.0015\n0.001\n\n2\n\n0.0005\n\n0\n110 120 130 140 150 160 170 180 190 200\nmH [GeV]\n\n0\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n700\nMinv [GeV]\n\n800\n\n900\n\n1000\n\nFIG. 55: Left: 200 TeV VLHC gg \u2192 HHH cross section as a function of MH .

Because new physics that could explain dark matter is likely to also lie at the\nTeV scale, most model building makes an attempt to incorporate solutions to some of these\nother problems along with EWSB. The literature is vast, but let's try to roughly classify\nsome of the major ideas to get a handle on the variations.\nThe broadest two categories of classes are weakly-coupled new physics which can be handled with perturbation theory, and strongly-coupled or \"strong dynamics\" models which\nare penetrable in some cases, others not. These include QCD-inspired theories like Technicolor [10, 11] (or more properly Extended [12, 13] or Walking [14] Technicolor, which can\nhandle a top quark mass very different from the other quark masses) and Topcolor-assisted\nTechnicolor [15] (\"TC2\"), which incorporates additional weakly-coupled gauge structure.\nStrong dynamics assumes that some TeV-scale massive or heavier fermions' attraction became strong at low energy scales, eventually causing their condensation to mesonic states\n(Technipions, Technirho, Technieta, etc.), the neutral scalars of which can incite EWSB via\ntheir SU(2)L gauge interactions. Strong dynamics scenarios are beyond the scope of these\nlectures, however, so I leave it for the interested student to study the excellent review article\nof Ref. [111].\nWhile strong dynamics theories are Higgsless in some sense, meaning no fundamental\nscalar fields, the terms is usually reserved for a new class of models where the EW symmetry\nis broken using boundary conditions on gauge boson wavefunctions propagating in finite\nextra dimensions (see e.g. Refs. [18, 112]). We'll also skip these.\nThere is far more theoretical effort expended on weakly-coupled EWSB, which is mostly\nvariations on what we can add to the single Higgs doublet of the SM:\n\u2780 1HDM + invisible (high-scale) new physics, hidden from direct detection\n\u2781 CP-conserving 2HDM: 4 types (minimal supersymmetry, MSSM, is Type II)\n\u2782 CP-violating 2HDM\n\u2783 Higgs singlet(s) (e.g. next-to-minimal supersymmetry, NMSSM)\n\u2784 Higgs triplets (often appear in Grand Unified Theories)\n\u2785 Little Higgs models: SU(2)L \u00d7 U(1)Y is part of larger gauge and global group\nThe first item, new high-scale physics hidden from direct detection, sounds like a cheat. It\nactually involves an important aspect of phenomenology: effective Lagrangians from higherdimensional operators. We'll come back to these in a moment. Two Higgs doublets instead\nof one is an idea with multiple sources. For instance, one doublet could give mass to the\nleptons and the other to the quarks, or one to the up-type fermions and the other to the\ndown-type, etc. We'll return to these after effective operators. Additional Higgs singlets\nlikewise have a variety of reasons for being written down, but usually it's just \"we can do it,\nso we will\". We'll skip these. Higgs triplets originated from natural appearance in left-right\nsymmetric GUTs. They're a bit exotic and typically have issues with precision EW data,\n57\n\n\fbut are interesting in that they predict the existence of doubly-charged Higgs states H \u00b1\u00b1 ,\nand a tree-level H \u00b1 W \u2213 Z coupling, which must be zero in most Higgs-doublet models. It\nwould therefore stand out experimentally. For all these cases I don't have time to cover, the\nHiggs Hunter's Guide is the best place to start to learn more [6].\nLittle Higgs theories, on the other hand, are different in that they necessarily involve\nnew scalar and gauge structure arising from an enlarged global symmetry from which the\nSM emerges, as well as additional matter content. Interestingly, in these models the Higgs\nlooks very much like the SM Higgs, but with O(v 2 /F 2 ) corrections, where F is typically a\nfew TeV, parametrically 4\u03c0 larger than the EW scale. The smallness of v 2 /F 2 could make\nit very difficult to measure Little Higgs corrections to Higgs observables. These models are\nprobably ultimately strongly-coupled at a scale \u039b \u223c 4\u03c0F , but this is an open question. If\nnature chose this course, the most interesting physics is the new gauge boson and matter\nfields that appears at a scale F . Refs. [19] provide nice overviews and simple explanations\nof the two primary Little Higgs mechanisms.\nA.\n\nHigher-dimensional operators\n\nThe new physics responsible for dark matter, flavor, neutrino masses, etc., might very well\nbe too massive to produce directly at colliders. This the dreaded SM-Higgs-only scenario,\nwhere LHC sees nothing new. It would really be an invitation to take a more rigorous look at\nall data \u2013 new physics effects might still appear as small deviations in precision observables.\nThe standard way of parameterizing this is to write down all the possible Lagrangian\noperators with the heavy fields integrated out which preserve SU(3)c \u00d7 SU(2)L \u00d7 U(1)Y\ngauge invariance. This was done over two decades ago for operators up to dimension six [86].\nAlthough not often emphasized in today's phenomenology, I consider this paper a must-read\nfor all students.\nLet's begin by considering the possible operators involving only the SM Higgs doublet.\nThere are two, of dimension six:\nO1 =\n\n1\n\u2202\u03bc (\u03a6\u2020 \u03a6) \u2202 \u03bc (\u03a6\u2020 \u03a6)\n2\n\n&\n\n1\nO2 = \u2212 (\u03a6\u2020 \u03a6)3\n3\n\n(31)\n\nfor the effective Lagrangian contribution\nL6D,\u03a6\n\n2\nX\nfi\n=\nOi , fi > 0\n\u039b2\ni=1\n\n(32)\n\n\u039b must be at least a couple TeV, otherwise we'd likely observe it directly at LHC.

Put another way, an ILC could have\naccess to new high-scale physics via altered Higgs\u2013gauge boson couplings, but not via Higgs\nself-couplings. This is in line with what we'd come to expect, as HH production is much\nsmaller. The shapes of the uncertainty curves in the figures depend on what values of the\noperator coefficients add to or subtract from the signal, with the added feature that the\nmomentum dependence of the Higgs self-couplings that the O1 operator introduces changes\nto kinematic distributions.\nIn addition to the Higgs-only D6 operators, there are a handful of operators involving\nthe Higgs and gauge boson fields together [86]:\n\u0002 + \u2212\u03bc\u03bd 1 3 3\u03bc\u03bd \u0003\nOW W = (\u03c6\u2020 \u03c6) W\u03bc\u03bd\nW\n+ 2 W\u03bc\u03bd W\n\u2020\n\u03bc\u03bd\nOBB = (\u03c6 \u03c6)B\n\u221a \u0002\n\u0002 \u03bc\u03bd B\n\u0003\u0003\n3\n+\n\u2212\nOBW = B \u03bc\u03bd (\u03c6\u2020 \u03c3 3 \u03c6)W\u03bc\u03bd\n+ 2 (\u03c6\u2020 T + \u03c6)W\u03bc\u03bd\n+ (\u03c6\u2020 T \u2212 \u03c6)W\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bd\nOB\n= (D \u03bc \u03c6)\u2020 (D\n\u03c6)B\u03bc\u03bd\n\u221a \u0002\n\u0003\u0003\n\u0002\n+\n\u2212\n\u03bc \u2020\n3\n3\nOW\n= (D \u03c6) \u03c3 (D \u03bd \u03c6)W\u03bc\u03bd\n+ 2 T + (D \u03bd \u03c6)W\u03bc\u03bd\n+ T \u2212 (D \u03bd \u03c6)W\u03bc\u03bd\nO\u03a6,1 = (D\u03bc \u03c6)\u2020 \u03c6\u03c6\u2020 (D \u03bc \u03c6)\nThese induce momentum-dependent HHV V vertices, so could be studied at an ILC or CLIC\nin the same manner as the Higgs-only couplings, as well as with rare Higgs decays [114],\nbut in general they're highly constrained by EW precisions observables (S, \u03c1, gV V V ) [115].\nInterestingly, it appears there has not been an update of the EW constraints on these\noperators since 1997 [116], although there are predictions for limits at an ILC [117]. There\nis, however, a new analysis for WBF Higgs at LHC includes the effects of some of these\noperators and finds that they would be encoded in the tagging jet azimuthal separation [118].\nThere is also a set of D6 operators involving the Higgs, fermion and gauge boson fields [86]:\n \u0304 \u03bc d)\nOd\u03c6 = (\u03c6\u2020 \u03c6)(q\u0304d\u03c6)\nO\u03c6d = i(\u03c6\u2020 D\u03bc \u03c6)(d\u03b3\nOD\u0304d = (D\u03bc q\u0304d)D \u03bc \u03c6\n(1)\n\nO\u03c6q = i(\u03c6\u2020 D\u03bc \u03c6)(q\u0304\u03b3 \u03bc q)\nO\u03c6\u03c6 = i(\u03c6\u2020 \u01ebD\u03bc \u03c6)(\u016b\u03b3 \u03bc d)\n(3)\nO\u03c6q = i(\u03c6\u2020 D\u03bc \u03c3 i \u03c6)(q\u0304\u03b3 \u03bc \u03c3 i q) ODd = (q\u0304D\u03bc d)D \u03bc \u03c6\n\ni\nOdW = (q\u0304\u03c3 \u03bc\u03bd \u03c3 i d)\u03c6W\u03bc\u03bd\nOdB = (q\u0304\u03c3 \u03bc\u03bd d)\u03c6B\u03bc\u03bd\n\nSome of these are constrained by precise LEP measurements of Zbb\u0304, \u03b3bb\u0304 couplings, but\nnot severely. They would give interesting rare Higgs decays like H \u2192 bb\u0304Z, bb\u0304\u03b3. Their\nphenomenology for LHC and even ILC is not really studied. Thus, I can't say to what scale\nthey might be sensitive given a SM Higgs discovery with nothing else observed.\nB.\n\nTwo-Higgs doublet models (2HDMs)\n\nThe most-often studied extension to the SM Higgs sector is the two-Higgs doublet model\n(2HDM) [6, 119]. That is, we add one additional SU(2)L doublet. Both of the doublets\nacquire a vev. For now let's assume CP conservation and work with in the real-vev basis.\nCounting degrees of freedom, four per complex doublet, and knowing that three modes are\n\"eaten\" to give the W \u00b1 and Z their masses, after SSB there must be five physical states.\nTwo of them will necessarily be charged (H \u00b1 ) regardless of how we assigned hypercharge to\neach doublet, leaving the other three neutral. Of those, two (h, H) will be CP-even and one\nwill be CP-odd (A), the last of which won't couple to the weak bosons at tree level. The\ngeneral 2HDM potential is quite messy [6, 120] , so we'll not discuss it.\n60\n\n\fRecall the primary role of the Higgs sector: to restore unitarity to weak boson scattering.\n2\nThis requires the gauge coupling to W W to be exactly 12 gW\nv, where v is what we measure\n1 4 2\nwith GF . In the amplitude, then, the coupling squared is 4 gW v . With two vevs, there is\nthe automatic constraint v12 + v22 \u2261 v 2 [121]. The ratio is tan \u03b2 \u2261 vv12 . The CP-even mass\neigenstates, which couple to the weak bosons, thus boil down to simply mixing:\n\u221a \u0002\n\u0003\nh = 2 \u2212(Re\u03c601 \u2212 v1 ) sin \u03b1 + (Re\u03c602 \u2212 v2 ) cos \u03b1\n(39)\n\u221a \u0002\n\u0003\n(40)\nH = 2 (Re\u03c601 \u2212 v1 ) cos \u03b1 + (Re\u03c602 \u2212 v2 ) sin \u03b1\n\nwhere \u03b1 is the angle which diagonalizes the 2 \u00d7 2 mixing matrix. The Higgs sector is\ntypically defined by \u03b1, tan \u03b2 and the potential parameters which govern the self-couplings.\nSome models are defined instead by MA and MZ .\nLet's pause for a moment to reflect on what would happen if we introduced CP violation [119]. This is a well-motivated exercise since there isn't enough CP violation in the\nSM model to account for baryogenesis in the early universe. The most immediate impact is\nthat h, H and A now mix. MA is supposed to parameterize the pseudoscalar pole, but it's\nnow mixed into three physical states, so it becomes ill-defined. Instead, we typically use the\ncharged Higgs mass. It would be logical to use MH \u00b1 for CP-conserving scenarios as well,\nbut this is one of those historical accidents that has too much momentum to change.\nRegarding the fermions, we can apportion the two doublets in four general ways [6]:\nI only \u03a62 couples to fermions\nII \u03a61 couples to down-type, \u03a62 to up-type fermions\nIII \u03a61 couples to down quarks, \u03a62 to up quarks and down leptons\nIV \u03a61 couples to quarks, \u03a62 to leptons\n\nTypes III and IV induce flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNCs), which are highly constrained, thus these models are not much studied any more. Types I and II are qualitatively\ndifferent and worth a quick look at the differences in their couplings, shown in Table V17 .\nBecause of which doublet gives the down-type fermions their masses, those Yukawa couplings to h and H are swapped between models, with a phase factor from mixing. Similarly,\nthe Af f \u0304 coupling is inverted and changes sign: cot \u03b2 \u2192 \u2212 tan \u03b2. The gauge coupling for h\nand H, of course, are unaffected by the Yukawa couplings and are fixed to sin(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) and\ncos(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1). (The sum of their squares in the amplitude must equal 1!)\nThe charged Higgs Yukawa couplings are slightly different yet. The left-handed coupling\nis proportional to the up-type Yukawa coupling, and the right-handed coupling the downtype Yukawa, for an out-flowing H \u2212 . The reverse is true for an outflowing H + . We have:\n\u0002\n\u0003\ng\ngH \u2212 D\u016a = \u221a\nmU cot \u03b2(1 + \u03b35 ) \u2212 mD cot \u03b2(1 \u2212 \u03b35 )\n(41)\n2 2MW\n\u0002\n\u0003\ng\ngH \u2212 D\u016a = \u221a\nmU cot \u03b2(1 + \u03b35 ) + mD tan \u03b2(1 \u2212 \u03b35 )\n(42)\n2 2MW\n\nwhere H \u2212 flows out, D is incoming and \u016a is outgoing.\n17\n\nNote that various references use different phase conventions for the Lagrangian. The important distinction\nis the phase between Higgs couplings, and a reference SM coupling such as ee\u03b3. I use positive terms in\nthe covariant derivative and drop the overall superfluous factor of i typical of most Lagrangians.\n\n61\n\n\fg\u03a6dd\u0304\ng\u03a6u\u016b\n\u03a6\ngf\ngf\ncos \u03b1\ncos \u03b1\nh \u2212 sin \u03b2\n\u2212 sin \u03b2\nsin \u03b1\n\u03b1\nH \u2212 sin \u03b2\n\u2212 sin\nsin \u03b2\nA \u2212i\u03b35 cot \u03b2 i\u03b35 cot \u03b2\n\u03b1\nsin \u03b1\nh \u2212 cos\nsin \u03b2\ncos \u03b2\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\nH \u2212 sin\n\u2212 cos\nsin \u03b2\ncos \u03b2\nA \u2212i\u03b35 cot \u03b2 \u2212i\u03b35 tan \u03b2\n\ng\u03a6V V\ngV\n\ng\u03a6ZA\ngV\n\nsin(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) \u2212 12 i cos(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1)\ncos(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) 12 i sin(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1)\n0\n0\n1\nsin(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) \u2212 2 i cos(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1)\ncos(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) 12 i sin(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1)\n0\n0\n\nTABLE V: Fermion and gauge boson couplings in Type I (upper) and II (lower) 2HDMs.\nC.\n\nType II 2HDM in the MSSM\n\nAt this point we should focus on the Type II 2HDM, because that's the one required\nto appear in the MSSM18 (see Ref. [123] for a detailed description). Model I will have\nsimilar features, modulo the couplings swaps given in Table V, so is understandable by\nanalogy. We'll spend the remaining portion discussing only SUSY Higgs phenomenology,\nand specifically minimal SUSY, the MSSM. However, by the end it should be apparent that\nextended Higgs sectors may often be treated as variations on a theme, with much of the\nphenomenology based on the same collider signatures.\nThe MSSM imposes tree-level constraints on the Higgs potential which require the various\n\u03bb to be gauge parameters (MSSM extensions add non-gauge terms). We'll come back to\nwhat the potential looks like in Sec. IV E and study its phenomenology, and for now simply\nexamine the implication of this structure on the mass spectrum. Because we consider only\nthe CP-conserving case here, we can get away with using MA as an input. The others will\nbe tan \u03b2 as discussed before, the average top squark mass MS , and an encoded trilinear\nmixing parameter for the top sector, Xt . This last one is important because\n\u221a of the large top\nYukawa corrections the MSSM Higgs sector receives. The values 0 and 6 MS are referred\nto as \"no mixing\" and \"maximal mixing\", because they extremize the loop corrections.

Figures from Ref. [7].\n\nThese equations exhibit the interesting property of h decoupling with increasing pseudoscalar mass: for large MA the heavy states H, A and H \u00b1 tend to be closely degenerate,\nand the light h has an asymptotic maximum mass which depends mostly on tan \u03b2. We see\nthis behavior, along with a plateau effect for Mh and MH , in Fig. 57. There is always at least\none CP-even Higgs boson in the mass region 90 . M\u03c6 . 145 GeV, assuming perturbativity\nto high scales. For large MA , toward the decoupling region, it is the lighter state, h, but at\nlow MA it is the heavier state, H. The transition region is sharper for larger tan \u03b2.\nThe mass spectrum is not the only feature to exhibit the decoupling and transition\nbehavior, however. Both the gauge and Yukawa couplings do the same. The V V \u03c6 couplings\nare shown in Fig. 58. By comparison with Fig. 57, we easily see that when either h or\nH is in its plateau mass region, it holds most of the gauge coupling; sin(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) \u2192 1 or\ncos(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) \u2192 1. In the transition region, the two states share the gauge coupling, and both\nare of comparable importance in unitarity cancellation. As with the mass spectrum, and by\nnow as anticipated, the transition region is sharper for larger tan \u03b2. Hold these two figures in\nyour mind, as they are going to play an extremely important phenomenological role shortly.\nUsing just trigonometry, let's rewrite the Yukawa couplings of Table V to see better how\nthey depend on MA and tan \u03b2:\n\u03b1\nghu\u016b = \u2212 cos\nY = \u2212[sin(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) + cot \u03b2 cos(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1)] Yu\nsin \u03b2 u\n\nghdd \u0304 =\n\ngHu\u016b =\ngHdd \u0304 =\n\nsin \u03b1\ncos \u03b2\n\u03b1\n\u2212 sin\nsin \u03b2\n\u03b1\n\u2212 cos\ncos \u03b2\n\n(46)\n\nYd = \u2212[sin(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) \u2212 tan \u03b2 cos(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1)] Yd\n\nYu = \u2212[cos(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) \u2212 cot \u03b2 sin(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1)] Yu\n\nYd = \u2212[cos(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) + tan \u03b2 sin(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1)] Yd\n\nThis is a far more convenient form, since tan \u03b2 is an input and sin(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1)/ cos(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) is the\nreduced h/H gauge coupling. These are both natural, convenient parameters to describe\nproduction cross sections and decay partial widths (thus branching ratios), rather than the\nCP-even mixing angle and sin \u03b2 or cos \u03b2, or their inverses.

For a more in-depth discussion, especially of why\nSUSY imposes these constraints, and for more detailed formulae, see Refs. [7, 123].\nNow that we know the couplings, we can obtain cross sections for h and H production\nsimply as correction factors to the SM channels of equal mass. There is no WBF or W/Zassociated pseudoscalar production, but there is both gg \u2192 A inclusive and top quark\nassociated production, tt\u0304A, which are easily obtained if one inserts the \u03b35 factor into the\nloop derivation for gg \u2192 A [7]. The charged Higgs is a special case as there is no SM\nanalogue; we'll discuss this in Sec. IV D in the context of searches. For the moment, let's\nexamine the neutral states' branching ratios, just to get an idea of how they behave. It's\neasy to suffer plot overload about now, so don't try to absorb every last detail; focus on the\ngeneral behavior, which you already should be able to guess from the couplings plots.\nFig. 60 shows the BRs for the CP-even states h and H, cut off at the mass plateaus.\nThey're basically what we would expect: both h and H behave like a SM Higgs of equal\nmass, except that the various couplings are dialed up or down. Mh can never be above\n\u223c 145 GeV, so it almost never has a significant BR to gauge bosons.

The new feature here is at\nsmall tan \u03b2, where decays A \u2192 hZ are possible. But otherwise A prefers to decay \u223c 90%\nto bb\u0304 and \u223c 10% to \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 , unless it is heavy enough to produce top quark pairs. That\ndominates only at small tan \u03b2 (large cot \u03b2), where the up-type coupling dominates. At large\ntan \u03b2, bb\u0304 and \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 both still win by a considerable margin.\nThere are similar plots for H \u00b1 , but they're not particularly enlightening as its decay\npatterns are drastically simpler: as far as phenomenology is concerned, it's BR\u223c 1 to tb\nwhen kinematically accessible, \u03c4 \u03bd if lighter. For low tan \u03b2 there is a rare BR to hW \u00b1 , but\nthat is predicted to always be difficult to observe.\nAll Higgs bosons can decay to SUSY particle pairs if they're light enough, but this is not\na very common occurrence across parameter space (especially since so much of it is ruled\nout already by LEP SUSY searches), so we'll bypass that discussion here.\nD.\n\nMSSM Higgs searches\n\nFor MSSM Higgs searches past, we start again with LEP. It didn't find anything, but\nplaced various limits. Let's begin with the charged Higgs search, because it's the simplest.\nThis proceeded via H + H \u2212 pair production (the only mechanism accessible at LEP) and\ndecay to \u03c4 \u03bd or cs, as there was never kinematic room for tb. Thus, the search had three\nchannels: dual taus, mixed tau plus hadronic decays, and an all-hadronic mode [124]. Because the production mechanism depends on only gauge-fixed couplings, the MSSM charged\nHiggs search is usually presented as a more general 2HDM search, with limits presented in\nthe MH \u00b1 v. BR(H \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c4 \u00b1 \u03bd) plane. Fig. 62 summarizes the obtained limits. To translate\n2\nthe general search limits to the MSSM Higgs sector inputs, recall Eq. 45, MH2 \u00b1 = MA2 + MW\n.\nThe difficulty of this search was the low ID efficiency for taus and charm quarks. Unfortunately, there is no final combined limit, but each of the collaborations has published final\nindependent limits [126, 127, 128, 129].

[125]. Right: L3 published limits from 2003, illustrating where each of the three decay\nchannels discussed in the text contributes to the overall limit [128]. There is no final LEP combined\nlimit, but judging from each of the individual limits [126, 127, 128, 129], it does not change\nsignificantly from the preliminary results.\n\nThe basic neutral Higgs boson search channels are exactly the same as in the SM for\neach of h and H, to which we add e+ e\u2212 \u2192 Z \u2217 \u2192 hA/HA production via the additional\ncouplings of Table V. Each of the four LEP collaborations presented a multitude of MSSM\nh/H/A search limits, and there are combined LEP results with CP-conservation [131] and\nCP-violation (CPX) [131, 132]. However, one should be somewhat wary of what precisely\nis presented. The results are usually shown as shaded exclusion blobs in either MA -tan \u03b2\nspace (for a very specific set of additional assumptions) or Mhi -tan \u03b2 space, also given some\nassumptions. There are literally dozens of pages of exclusion plots, depending on what one\nchooses for the mixing parameter Xt , top quark mass (recall the strong Mh dependence on\nmt ), stop masses, \u03bc, and so on. This is far too much to show here, because the exclusion\ncontours change so much from assumption to assumption \u2013 it's impossible even to select a\nrepresentative sample without misleading the uninitiated. See e.g. Ref. [133].\nThe curious student should flip through the plots in Refs. [131, 133] simply to get a feel\nfor how wild this variation is. Observe how much the contours change depending on the top\nquark mass \u2013 it is obviously still fairly poorly measured, as far as fits to supersymmetry go.\nNote also that the plots are always logarithmic in tan \u03b2, which compresses the unexcluded\nlarge-tan \u03b2 region, making it appear that parameter space is vastly ruled out in many cases.\nThis simply isn't true. Finally, I should comment that the \"theoretically inaccessible\"\ndisallowed blobs are even more grossly misleading. All one has to do is move the stop\nmasses up slightly and these retreat dramatically. Perhaps a more logical approach is the\nmodel-independent h/H/A search of OPAL [134].\n67\n\n\fMSSM Higgs Searches at LHC are also mostly variants on the SM search channels, the\nexceptions being charged Higgses, rare (SUSY or Higgs pair) decay modes, and one new\nproduction channel, bb\u0304\u03c6, which is important at large tan \u03b2 where the coupling is enhanced\nto top-quark Yukawa strength. tt\u0304\u03c6 rates tend to be about the same as the SM for equal\nmass, or slightly suppressed. WBF h or H rates can only be suppressed relative to the SM,\ndue to the appearance of sin2 (\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1) or cos2 (\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1), respectively. Inclusive rates can change\nrather dramatically, however, because the b loop can be extremely important. Fig. 63 shows\nthe cross sections for gg \u2192 \u03c6 as a function of the physical masses, for small and large tan \u03b2.\nThese may be compared with the SM cross sections of Fig. 16.\nLet's concentrate on the WBF modes, however, as they turn out to be the most interesting. Recall the plateau behavior of h and H masses as a function of MA (cf. Fig. 57), and\nsimultaneously the h and H gauge coupling behavior (cf. Fig. 58). The astute student will\nrealize that this implies that WBF Higgs production in an accessible mass region probably\nalways occurs at a good rate, somewhat suppressed but never much so. Fig. 64 summarizes\nsome of this previous information and goes on to show the cross section times BR to tau pairs\n(in the two accessible tau decay modes), also as a function of MA [135]. Indeed, eyeballing\nthe upper and lower rows, it appears that between h and H, there's always a signal in WBF.\nIt may be slightly suppressed, but we know from SM WBF Higgs studies (cf. Sec. II C 4)\nthat since so little data is required to make an observation, the signal could be suppressed\nby a factor of several and be detectable. The reason is that in the MSSM the h and H\nplateau mass ranges are in the \"good\" region of WBF Higgs observability. Actually, quite\na large mass region is observable, but if the MSSM predicted Higgs masses closer to the Z\npole, there could be trouble (but LEP would already have discovered such a Higgs).\nThis bit of luck forms the basis of the MSSM Higgs No-Lose Theorem: at least one of the\nCP-even Higgs states, h or H, is guaranteed to be observable in WBF at LHC [64, 135]. The\noriginal parton-level studies have since been confirmed with full ATLAS detector simulation,\nand actually improved [136]. The parton-level coverage plots shown in Fig. 65, however, are\nsimpler to grasp. Very little data would be required for discovery, and for some MA it would\nbe possible to observe both h and H simultaneously.\n\n\u001b (pgg\n\n1000\n\n! \b) [pb\u2104\n\n\u001b (p\ngg\n\n1000\n\ns = 14 TeV\n\nh\n\ntan\n\n100\n\n!

There's been some work\non an NMSSM No-Lose Theorem [137, 138, 139, 140], which extends the Higgs sector by a\ncomplex singlet [6]. The outlook for LHC is promising, but not obviously rock-solid.\n19\n\nThere's always fine print...\n\n69\n\n\fThe No-Lose Theorem is great for the CP-even states, but what about the other Higgses?\nI'll gloss over the bulk of searches, since they're mostly variants on the SM ones, and move\non to the special case of heavy H/A (towards decoupling) and this new channel bb\u0304\u03c6. The\nFeynman diagrams appear in Fig. 66. Recall that H has a tan \u03b2 enhancement to down-type\nquarks in the decoupling region, and A always has this enhancement. We already know\nthat means that H and A prefer to decay 90% of the time to bb\u0304 and 10% to \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 , but it\nwould be impossible to observe either of those final states in inclusive production, and WBF\nproduction is zilch for H in the decoupling region. However, the LHC being essentially\na gluon collider, the initial state can create high-energy b pairs, which can then Brem a\nHiggs, either H or A, which are essentially degenerate (but do not interfere due to the \u03b35\ncoupling). Since the b jets are produced at high-pT , the H/A must recoil against them, so\nit also produced with a transverse boost. It's decay products are then not back-to-back,\nallowing for tau pair reconstruction; H/A \u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 may also be used, but is a rare mode.\nThe final state is then bb\u0304\u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 (or bb\u0304\u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ), which is taggable and distinguishable from mixed\nQCD-EW backgrounds because the tau pair invariant mass is in the several-hundred GeV\nregion.\nFig. 67 shows the cross section times BR to tau pairs for 300 GeV Higgs bosons as a\nfunction of tan \u03b2, and also the CMS expected discovery reach for various final states in\ntau or muon pairs, with only 30 fb\u22121 of luminosity, or about 1/10 of the total LHC data\nexpected. Coverage is not complete, because this mode doesn't produce enough rate at low\ntan \u03b2 where there is little coupling enhancement, but is still a significant search tool. The\nmass resolution achievable for H and A using taus in this mode is even pretty good, on the\norder of a couple tens of GeV, possibly better. Of course, if the decay to muons is accessible\n(at very large tan \u03b2, then mass resolution would be on the order of a GeV.\nThis would determine MA quite well, good enough for comparison with theory (at least\nat first), but what about the other major Higgs parameter, tan \u03b2? The bb\u0304\u03c6 production rate\nis directly proportional to tan2 \u03b2, so we can measure it using the overall rate, with the mild\n(but not rock solid) assumption that the ratio of bb\u0304 and \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 BRs is the ratio of the b and \u03c4\nsquared masses, i.e. that BR(H/A \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 ) \u223c 10% [141]. The major sources of uncertainty\nare this assumption, the machine luminosity uncertainty of 5 \u2212 10%, PDF uncertainties of\nprobably about 5%, and higher-order QCD corrections to the production process of probably\nabout 20% [142, 143].\nFig. 68 shows the CMS expected uncertainty on tan \u03b2 using this method, as a function\nof MA and for 30 or 60 fb\u22121 of data. In general, 10 \u2212 20% appears achieveable. This is not\nspectacular, but would be a significant first step toward sorting out the new Higgs sector and\npresumably comparing to other SUSY discovery measurements. Clearly the higher-order\nQCD uncertainties dominate, which could probably be improved with better theoretical\ncalculations over the next decade. This will be done if heavy Higgses are discovered.\n\nq\n\nb\n\nq\u0016\n\nH\n\u0016b\n\ng\n\nb\n\ng\n\nH\n\u0016b\n\nFIG. 66: Feynman diagrams for gg \u2192 bb\u0304\u03c6 production at LHC.\n\n70\n\n\f\u03c3(gg\u2192bbH)\u00d7BR(H\u2192\u03c4\u03c4)\n\n40\n\n3\n\nH,A\n\u2192\n\n3.5\n\n50\n\n60 -1\nfb\n\nmA = 300 GeV/c2\n\n\u03bc \u03bc,\n\ntan\u03b2\n\n\u03c3\u00d7BR(pb)\n\n4\n\n\u03c3(gg\u2192bbA)\u00d7BR(A\u2192\u03c4\u03c4)\n\nCMS, 30 fb\n\n-1\n\n2\n\n2\n\n\u03bc = 300 GeV/C , M2 = 200 GeV/c\n2\n\n2\n\nAt = 6 TeV/c , MSUSY = 1 TeV/c\n\n2.5\n\n2\n\nAt = 2450 GeV/c\nM2 = 200 GeV/c\n\n1.5\n\n\u03bc = 300 GeV/c\n\n30\n\n2\n\n2\n\n/c\n\n\u03bc\n\n2\n\n2\n\nGeV\n\n2\n\nc\n\neV/\n\nG\n500\n\n20\n\n\u03bc=\n\n10\n\nHSUSY \u2192\u03c4\u03c4 \u2192 2 jets + X, 60 fb\nHSUSY \u2192\u03c4\u03c4 \u2192 ll+X\n\nHSUSY \u2192\u03c4\u03c4\u2192e\u03bc/lj/jj\n\n1\n\n-1\n\nHSUSY \u2192\u03c4\u03c4 \u2192e\u03bc +X\nHSUSY \u2192\u03c4 \u03c4\u2192lepton + jet + X\n\n0.5\n\n0\n0\n\n00\n= -2\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\nExcluded by LEP\n\n45\n\n100\n\ntan\u03b2\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n2\n\nmA (GeV/c )\n\n30\n\nAt = 2450 GeV/c\n25\n\nHSUSY\u2192\u03c4\u03c4\u2192ll/lj/jj\n\n2\n\nHSUSY\u2192\u03c4\u03c4\u2192e\u03bc/lj/jj\n\n\u03bc = 300 GeV/c2\nM2 = 200 GeV/c\n\n2\n2\n\n20\n\ntan\u03b2\n\n\u2206tan\u03b2/tan\u03b2(%)\n\nFIG. 67: Left: bb\u0304\u03c6 production cross section at LHC times the BR to tau pairs, as a function of\ntan \u03b2 for MA = 300 GeV.

All we do know is the very important fact that, despite\neverything else we may see at Tevatron or LHC, the only way to prove the existence of\ntwo Higgs doublets is to directly observe the charged Higgs states. I cannot emphasize this\nenough. For all we know, an extra neutral state might simply be the residue of an extra Higgs\nsinglet; there could be more to the flavor sector that confuses us when we try to measure\nYukawa couplings or tan \u03b2. Thus, observing the H \u00b1 states would be a huge qualitative step\ntoward understanding what the Higgs sector is. How would this proceed experimentally?\n71\n\n\fg\n\nt\nt\n\nb\n\nH\u2212\n\nb\nFIG. 69: Feynman diagrams for charged Higgs production at hadron colliders. The short line\nbreaking the b quark propagator represents how the process may also be regarded as initiated by\na b parton in the proton, rather than from gluon splitting to a b quark pair.\n\nAt Tevatron there is very little energy available for direct charged Higgs production,\nsince it must be produced in association with a top quark (large coupling), as shown in\nthe Feynman diagrams of Fig. 69. However, if MH \u00b1 is small enough, the top quark can\ndecay to bH \u00b1 followed by H \u00b1 \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd if tan \u03b2 > 1, and equally to bc and cs if tan \u03b2 < 1; if\nMH \u00b1 & 120 GeV, then the BR to W \u00b1 bb\u0304 via a top quark loop becomes significant. Fig. 70\nshows the t \u2192 bH \u00b1 BR as a function of MH \u00b1 for a few select tan \u03b2, and as a function of\ntan \u03b2 for MH \u00b1 = 120 GeV. At low tan \u03b2, the partial width is driven mainly by the top quark\nYukawa, while at large tan \u03b2 it's primarily the bottom quark. Weakness of both Yukawas\nin the intermediate-tan \u03b2 regime results in a comparatively reduced top quark partial width\n(recall Eqs. (41,42)). For\npfixed MH \u00b1 , the partial width is symmetric in log(tan \u03b2) about\na minimum at tan \u03b2 = mt /mb . Charged Higgs decays to hW \u00b1 or AW \u00b1 are generally\ndisallowed in the MSSM from LEP mass limits on h and A.\nThe Tevatron search proceeds both as appearance (i.e. looking directly for H \u00b1 in the top\nquark sample) and disappearance, or missing rate for top quark to bW \u00b1 . Fig. 71 goes on to\nshow the expected 95% CL limits in the MH \u00b1 \u2212 tan \u03b2 plane that Tevatron Run I achieved,\nand Run II might reach depending on how much data it ultimately records. The very slight\nchange between 2 and 10 fb\u22121 reveals that the experiments there are statistics-limited, but\nnot by a great margin.\n\n0.1\n\nt ! H + b)\n\nt !

Fig.\nfrom Ref.

This is very difficult due to a subtlety of tau decays. Left-handed taus decay\nto soft leptons [146]. Since neutrinos are left-handed, helicity conservation in scalar decay\nmeans all taus are as well. We need a lepton to trigger the event, and it must come from\nH \u00b1 instead of t, so that there is only one source of missing transverse momentum and we\ncan fully reconstruct t, and H \u00b1 transversely. Only a small fraction of the small rate could\npass the necessary detector kinematic cuts to be recorded. This limits the search to large\ntan \u03b2 or small MH \u00b1 , where the production rate is largest.

Primarily\nwe're concerned with discovering all the states, but especially the charged Higgs as it's the\nkey to confirming the existence of two Higgs doublets. That turns out to be extraordinarily\ndifficult due to a combination of factors, from overwhelming QCD backgrounds to characteristics of left-handed tau decays. Fig. 73 summarizes the reach for h, H, A and H \u00b1 [70].\nIt's reassuring that the No-Lose Theorem holds and we're guaranteed to find at least one\nof the CP-even states, h or H. However, moderate tan \u03b2 and the decoupling limit (large\nMA ) both present significant gaps in coverage to observe any of the additional states. This\nis especially more apparent once one realizes that the region below the solid black curve\nis already excluded by LEP, so those LHC access regions don't matter. The figure is from\n2001 and needs updating \u2013 some significant positive changes exist \u2013 but the general picture\nremains.\n\nFIG. 73: Summary of MSSM Higgs boson discovery reaches at LHC (and extended to SLHC via\nthe solid red line), combining ATLAS and CMS, in the tan \u03b2 \u2212 MA plane in the maximal mixing\nscenario. The reach is defined as 5\u03c3 discovery in at least one production and decay channel. Below\nthe solid black curve is the region excluded by LEP. Figure from Ref. [70].\n\n74\n\n\fE.\n\nMSSM Higgs potential\n\nI've touched on the bits of Higgs gauge and Yukawa couplings in the MSSM that are\nqualitatively different that the SM: MA and tan \u03b2. But we should look at self-couplings\nmore closely, because in a general 2HDM (or the subset MSSM) they are radically different.\nFirst, because there are more Higgs bosons, there are more self-couplings \u2013 six for the neutral\nstates alone, to be precise: \u03bbhhh , \u03bbHhh , \u03bbHHh , \u03bbHHH , \u03bbhAA , \u03bbHAA . In the MSSM these are\nall equal to MZ2 /v times various mixing angles (which aren't particularly enlightening so I\ndon't show them) plus additional shifts from top quark Yukawa loop corrections. That is,\nthey are all (mostly) gauge parameters. However, in the large-MA decoupling limit which\nrecovers the SM, \u03bbhhh \u2192 \u03bbSM .\nIf we discover SUSY, we'd start by assuming it's the MSSM. To measure the MSSM\npotential in that case, we'd have to observe at least six different Higgs pair production modes\nto measure the six self-couplings. (Note that I'm leaving out the possible self-couplings\ninvolving charged Higgses.) Inclusive Higgs pair production looks generally like it does in\nthe SM, gg \u2192 \u03c61 \u03c62 via triangle and box loop diagrams as shown in Fig. 74, but the b quark\nloops become important and must be included.\nUnfortunately, the box diagram totally swamps the one containing the self-coupling we\ncare about by a factor tan2 \u03b2, and in any case backgrounds from H/Abb\u0304 production appear\nto be overwhelming [103]: very generally, LHC would not obtain any \u03bb measurements at all.\nThe one very limited exception is that LHC could clearly observe Higgs pair production if it\ncame from resonant heavy Higgs decay, H/A \u2192 hh. An example peak is shown in Fig. 75.\nHowever, this would measure only a BR, at best, not an absolute coupling. Sadly, exactly\nthe same situation exists for Higgs pairs at a future ILC [104].\n\ng\n\nq H\nq\nq\n\nH (A)\nH (A)\n\ni(j )\n\ng\n\ng\n\nj\n\ni\n\ng\n\nq\n\nq\nq\n\nq\n\nH (A)\nj\n\nH (A)\ni\n\nFIG. 74: Feynman diagrams for Higgs pair production in a 2HDM like the MSSM.

Rather, it's a solid introduction, focusing on the basics.\nThis includes SM production and decay, mostly at LHC, where we're confident we could\ndiscovery a SM-like Higgs, and many non-SM-like variants. I focused on the most important\nchannels which guarantee discovery, and especially in weak boson fusion (WBF) as those\nare the most powerful (best S/B, distinctive) search channels, covering the broadest range\nof Higgs mass. I emphasized that our understanding of LHC Higgs physics has changed\ndramatically from the days of the ATLAS TDR, for example, which is now quite obsolete.\nHowever, ATLAS has produced a plethora of Notes and summaries of Notes to cover the\nchanges, and CMS published a fresh TDR [48] in 2006 which covers the changes as well.\nWe now understand the LHC to be such a spectacular Higgs factory that not only can it\ndiscover any mass of SM-like Higgs boson, it can also do an impressive job of measuring all its\nquantum properties. Granted, Higgs couplings measurements won't be precision-level if the\nHiggs is light, as expected from EW precision data, but they would nonetheless be absolute\ncouplings measurements. The LHC can even make significant steps toward measuring the\nSM Higgs potential, at least the Higgs trilinear self-coupling, although depending on Mh it\nmay require precision gauge and Yukawa couplings input from a future e+ e\u2212 collider (an\nILC) to control the major systematic uncertainties. I also highlighted where an ILC could\nmake improvements to the LHC's measurements, and where it would be vital to filling in\ngaps in LHC results.\nThe final third of the lectures discussed BSM Higgs sectors, but only the 2HDM MSSM\nHiggs sector in any detail. Many SM Higgs sector extensions are rather simple variants on SM\nphenomenology, involving factorizable changes in production and decay rates (couplings),\nmostly arising from mixing angles. This is not general, however, and there are plenty of\n\"exotic\" models \u2013 Higgs triplets, for example \u2013 which would be qualitatively different, but\ntherefore simultaneously distinctive. The popular focus on the MSSM 2HDM is because of\nseveral other outstanding questions in particle physics, like dark matter or the theoretical\ndirty laundry of the SM Higgs sector, which strongly motivate the other new physics.\nStudents who wish to engage in Higgs phenomenology research should definitely take the\ntime to expand their scope beyond the SM and the MSSM. Other extensions are equally\nwell-motivated, such as Little Higgs, not to mention strong dynamics. But the two wellstudied basic models I covered here give one a strong foundation for other BSM Higgs\nphenomenology by analogy. Happy Higgs hunting!\nAcknowledgments\n\nI would like to thank Sally Dawson and the TASI 2006 organizers for the opportunity to\ngive these lectures, and for an extremely pleasant experience at the summer school.
