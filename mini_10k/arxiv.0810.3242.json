We prove a general result which implies that the global and FrobeniusPerron dimensions of a fusion category generate Galois invariant ideals in the\nring of algebraic integers.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe goal of this note is to give some new restrictions on the Grothendieck rings\nof (multi-)fusion categories. Let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic\nzero and let A \u2282 k be the subring of algebraic integers. Recall (see [ENO]) that a\nmulti-fusion category C over k is a k\u2212linear semisimple rigid tensor category with\nfinite dimensional Hom spaces and finitely many simple objects; such category is\nsaid to be fusion category if its unit object 1 is simple. The Grothendieck ring\nK(C) of a multi-fusion category C is an example of a based ring in a sense of [L1],\nsee \u00a72.2 below. In particular for any irreducible representation E of K(C) \u2297Z k its\nformal codegree fE \u2208 k is defined, see \u00a72.2. It is easy to see from the definition that\nfE \u2208 A \u2282 k. The numbers fE as E runs through the irreducible representations of\nK(C) \u2297Z k are called formal codegrees of multi-fusion category C.\nDefinition 1.1. An algebraic integer \u03b1 is called a d\u2212number if the ideal it generates\nin the ring of algebraic integers is invariant under the action of the absolute Galois\ngroup Gal(Q\u0304/Q).\nHere is the main result of this note.\nTheorem 1.2. The formal codegrees of a multi-fusion category are d\u2212numbers.\nWe remark that for a general based ring the formal codegrees are not necessarily\nd\u2212numbers, see Example 1.6.\nWe refer the reader to [ENO, \u00a78.2] for the definition of the Frobenius-Perron\ndimension FPdim(C) \u2208 R of a fusion category C. It is known (see loc. cit.) that\nFPdim(C) is an algebraic integer. Let \u03c6 : A \u2282 C be an arbitrary ring embedding. The definition implies immediately that \u03c6\u22121 (FPdim(C)) is one of the formal\ncodegrees of C. Thus we have:\nCorollary 1.3. For a fusion category C its Frobenius-Perron dimension FPdim(C)\nis a d\u2212number.\n\u0003\nWe refer the reader to [ENO, Definition 2.2] for the definition of the global\ndimension dim(C) of a fusion category C. Let C \u0303 be the sphericalization of C, see\n[ENO, Proposition 5.14]. It follows immediately from definitions that 2 dim(C) is\n \u0303 Thus applying Theorem 1.2 to the fusion category\none of the formal codegrees of C.\nC \u0303 we have:\nDate: October 25, 2018.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nVICTOR OSTRIK\n\nCorollary 1.4. For a fusion category C its global dimension dim(C) is a d\u2212number.\n\u0003\nRemark 1.5. Let C be a fusion category. Choose a ring embedding \u03c6 : A \u2282 C\nand let IF P (C) \u2282 A be a principal ideal generated by \u03c6\u22121 (FPdim(C)) (note that\nby Corollary 1.3 the ideal IF P (C) does not depend on a choice of \u03c6). Similarly, let\nI(C) \u2282 A be a principal ideal generated by dim(C). Then [ENO, Proposition 8.22]\nsays that I(C) \u2282 IF P (C). We don't know any example when IF P (C) 6= I(C).\nFor a based ring K a categorification is a (multi-)fusion category C and an isomorphism of based rings K \u2243 K(C). Theorem 1.2 implies that many based rings\nhave no categorifications.\nExample 1.6. Let k, l, m, n be nonnegative integers satisfying k 2 +l2 = lm+kn+1\nand let K(k, l, m, n) be the based ring with the basis 1, X, Y and the multiplication\ngiven by (see [O2, \u00a73.1])\nX 2 = 1 + mX + kY, Y 2 = 1 + lX + nY, XY = Y X = kX + lY.\n\nIt is easy to compute that any formal codegree of K(2, 1, 0, 2) is a root of (irreducible) polynomial t3 \u2212 26t2 + 148t \u2212 148; using Lemma 2.7 (v) and Theorem 1.2\nwe see that K(2, 1, 0, 2) has no categorifications.\nAnother condition for a based ring to admit a categorification is [ENO, Theorem 8.51]. It states that for a fusion category C, an object X \u2208 C and an irreducible representation E of K(C)\u2297Z k the number Tr([X], E) is a cyclotomic integer.\nIn particular this implies the same conclusion as in Example 1.6: the based ring\nK(2, 1, 0, 2) has no categorifications. On the other hand, Theorem 1.2 implies that\nrings K(3, 2, 3, 2) and K(8, 1, 8, 7) have no categorifications while [ENO, Theorem\n8.51] gives no conclusion for these rings. On the other hand [ENO, Theorem 8.51]\nimplies that ring K(911, 463, 1799, 232) has no categorification while our Theorem\n1.2 is inconclusive for this ring (this is a unique example with l \u2264 k < 1000; I am\nvery grateful to Josiah Thornton for finding this example). Finally, both [ENO,\nTheorem 8.51] and Theorem 1.2 are inconclusive for the based rings of rank 2 while\nit is known that many of them have no categorifications, see [O1].\nRecall (see e.g. [W]) that a cyclotomic unit is a product of a root of 1 and units\nn\n\u22121\nof the form \u03b6\u03b6\u22121\nwhere \u03b6 is a root of 1. Notice that [ENO, Theorem 8.51] implies\nthat a formal codegree fE of a multi-fusion category C is a cyclotomic integer1.\nThus Theorem 1.2 and Corollary 2.10 imply the following result:\nCorollary 1.7. Let fE be a formal codegree of a multi-fusion category C. There\nexists a positive integer m such that fEm is a rational integer times a cyclotomic\nunit.\nLet C be a fusion category and let X \u2208 C be a simple object. We refer the\nreader to [ENO, \u00a72.1] for the definition of squared norm |X|2 \u2208 k \u00d7 (which was\ninitially defined by M. M\u00fcger). Recall that if C has a pivotal structure, then\n|X|2 = dim(X) dim(X \u2217 ) = | dim(X)|2 , see [ENO, Proposition 2.9].\nTheorem 1.8. Let C be a braided fusion category. Then for any simple object\nX \u2208 C the squared norm |X|2 is a d\u2212number.\n1Actually in [ENO, Theorem 8.51] it is assumed that the category C is fusion category. But\nthe proof in loc. cit. extends easily to the case of multi-fusion categories.\n\n\fON FORMAL CODEGREES OF FUSION CATEGORIES\n\n3\n\nRemark 1.9. (i) We don't know whether FPdim(X) is always a d\u2212number for a\nsimple object X of a braided fusion category.\n(ii) There exists a fusion category (related\nwith Haagerup subfactor, see [AH])\n\u221a\nwith a simple object of dimension 12 (1 + 13) which is not a d\u2212number. Thus the\nassumption of theorem 1.8 that the category C is braided can not be omitted.\nAcknowledgment. I am deeply grateful to Vladimir Drinfeld for useful discussions and encouragement.

For a multi-fusion category C we denote by O(C) the set\nof isomorphism classes of simple objects of C. For an object X \u2208 C we denote by\n[X] its class in the Grothendieck ring K(C); for\nP X \u2208 C and Y \u2208 O(C) we denote by\n[X : Y ] the multiplicity of Y in X (so [X] = Y \u2208O(C) [X : Y ][Y ]).\nWe say that a multi-fusion category is indecomposable (see [ENO, \u00a72.4]) if it is\nnot a direct sum of two nonzero multi-fusion categories (clearly, any fusion category\nis automatically indecomposable).\nFor a multi-fusion category C let Z(C) denote its Drinfeld center, see e.g. [M].\nIt is known (see [ENO, Theorem 2.15]) that Z(C) is again a multi-fusion category;\nmoreover for an indecomposable multi-fusion category C the category Z(C) is a\nfusion category. It follows that the forgetful functor F : Z(C) \u2192 C admits a right\nadjoint functor I : C \u2192 Z(C). We will use the following fact, see [ENO, Proposition\n5.4], [EO, Proposition 3.32]: for any X \u2208 C\n(1)\n\n[F (I(X))] =\n\nX\n\n[Y ][X][Y \u2217 ]\n\nY \u2208O(C)\n\n2.2. Based rings. In this section we recall the basic notions of the theory of based\nrings following [L1, L2].\nDefinition 2.1. ([L1, \u00a71.1]) A based ring is a pair (R, B) where R is a ring, B is\na basis of R over Z such that\n(i) All structure constants of R with respect to basis\nP B are nonnegative integers;\n(ii) There exists a subset B0 \u2282 B such that 1 = b\u2208B0 b;\n(iii) Let \u03c4 : R \u2192 Z be the group homomorphism such that its restriction to\nB \u2282 R is the characteristic function of the subset B0 \u2282 B. There exists an antiinvolution r 7\u2192 r\u0303 of the ring R which preserves the subset B and such that \u03c4 (bb\u2032 ) = 0\nfor b\u2032 \u2208 B \\ {b\u0303} and \u03c4 (bb\u0303) = 1 for any b \u2208 B.\nExample 2.2. (i) Let C be a multi-fusion category. Then its Grothendieck ring\nK(C) with a basis given by the classes of simple objects is an example of based\nring.\n(ii) Here is a special case of (i). Let G be a finite group. Then its group ring\nZ[G] together with a basis G \u2282 Z[G] is an example of based ring.\n\n\f4\n\nVICTOR OSTRIK\n\nFor a based ring (R, B) its rank is by definition the cardinality of the set B. In\nthis note we will consider only based rings (R, B) of finite rank. This implies that\nthe k\u2212algebra R\u2297Z k is semisimple, see [L1, 1.2(a)]. In what follows a representation\nof R is finite dimensional representation over the field k. Let Irr(R) denote the set\nof isomorphism classes of irreducible representations of R.\nLet (R, B) be a based ring and let \u03c4 : R \u2192 Z be as in Definition 2.1 (iii). We\nextend \u03c4 by linearity to the map \u03c4k : R \u2297Z k \u2192 k. The pair (R \u2297Z k, \u03c4k ) is an\nexample of algebra with a trace form, see [L2, Chapter 19]. This means that the\nbilinear form (x, y) = \u03c4k (xy) on R \u2297Z k is non-degenerate; thus we can identify\nR \u2297Z k with the dual space (R \u2297Z k)\u2217 . For E \u2208 Irr(R) let \u03b1E \u2208 R \u2297Z k be the\nelement corresponding to a linear function Tr(?, E) \u2208 (R \u2297Z k)\u2217 .\nP\nLemma 2.3. (see [L2, Proposition 19.2]) We have explicitly \u03b1E = b\u2208B Tr(b, E)b\u0303.\nThe element \u03b1E \u2208 R \u2297Z k is central; it acts by a scalar fE \u2208 k on E and by zero\non any other E \u2032 \u2208 Irr(R).\n\u0003\nThe scalar fE is called a formal codegree of representation E. It is clear from\ndefinition that fE is an algebraic integer.\nExample 2.4. Let \u03c7 : R \u2192 k be a ring homomorphism. Let E\u03c7 be the corresponding one dimensional representation of R. Then clearly\nX\nX\nf E\u03c7 =\n\u03c7(b)\u03c7(b\u0303) =\n|\u03c7(b)|2 .\nb\u2208B\n\nb\u2208B\n\nIn the case of based ring K(C) from Example 2.2 (i) we say that the scalars fE\nare formal codegrees of the multi-fusion category C.\nExample 2.5. It is easy to compute that for the based ring from Example 2.2 (ii)\n|G|\nwe have fE = dim(E)\n. This is a motivation for our terminology.\nP\nLemma 2.6. For any based ring (R, B) an element b\u2208B bb\u0303 is central. It acts on\nE \u2208 Irr(R) as fE dim(E)idE .\nP\nProof. Consider the element \u03b1 = E\u2208Irr(R) dim(E)\u03b1E \u2208 R \u2297Z k. By Lemma 2.3 \u03b1\nis central and it acts on E \u2208 Irr(R) as fE dim(E)idE .\nSince the regular representation R \u2297Z k of R decomposes as \u2295E\u2208Irr(R) E dim(E)\nwe see that\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\ndim(E)\nTr(b, E)b\u0303 =\nTr(b, R \u2297Z k)b\u0303 =\n\u03c4 (bb\u2032 b\u0303\u2032 )b\u0303 =\nb\u2032 b\u0303\u2032\n\u03b1=\nE\u2208Irr(R)\n\nb\u2208B\n\nb\u2208B\n\nThe Lemma is proved.\n\nb,b\u2032 \u2208B\n\nb\u2032 \u2208B\n\n\u0003\n\n2.3. d\u2212numbers.

Proofs\n3.1. Key Lemma. Let C be a multi-fusion category and let Z(C) be its Drinfeld\ncenter. The forgetful functor F : Z(C) \u2192 C induces a ring homomorphism f :\nK(Z(C)) \u2192 K(C). It is clear that the image of this map is contained in the center\nZ(K(C)) of the ring K(C).\nLet E \u2208 Irr(K(C)). By Schur's Lemma for any x \u2208 K(Z(C)) the element\nf (x) \u2208 K(C) acts on E by a scalar \u03c7E (x) \u2208 k. Extending \u03c7E by linearity we\nget a homomorphism \u03c7E : K(Z(C)) \u2297Z k \u2192 k. Let \u00ca be the corresponding one\ndimensional (hence irreducible) representation of K(Z(C)).\nLemma 3.1. We have f\u00ca = fE2 .\nP\nProof. By Example 2.4 an element Y \u2208O(Z(C))[F (Y )] * [F (Y \u2217 )] \u2208 K(C) acts on the\nrepresentation E as f\u00ca idE . We compute\nX\n\n[F (Y )][F (Y \u2217 )] =\n\nY \u2208O(Z(C))\n\nX\n\nX\n\n[F (Y ) : X][X][F (Y \u2217 )] =\n\nX\n\nX\n\n[I(X) : Y ][X][F (Y \u2217 )] =\n\nY \u2208O(Z(C)) X\u2208O(C)\n\nY \u2208O(Z(C)) X\u2208O(C)\n\nX\n\n[I(X)\u2217 : Y \u2217 ][X][F (Y \u2217 )] =\n\nY \u2208O(Z(C)),X\u2208O(C)\n\nX\n\n[X][F (I(X)\u2217 )] =\n\nX\u2208O(C)\n\nX\n\n[F (I(X))][X \u2217 ].\n\nX\u2208O(C)\n\nSince [F (I(X))] \u2208 Z(K(C)) it acts by a scalar on the irreducible representation\nE.

Reduction of the proof of Theorem 1.2 to the case when C is modular.\nWe can assume that the category C is indecomposable since the formal codegrees\nof a direct sum of multi-fusion categories are clearly just formal codegrees of the\nsummands.\nThe Drinfeld center of an indecomposable multi-fusion category is a fusion category, so Lemma 3.1 and Corollary 2.9 imply that we can assume that the category\nC is a fusion category.\nFor a fusion category C let C\u0303 be its sphericalization, see [ENO, Proposition\n5.14]. This is a spherical fusion category together with forgetful functor C \u0303 \u2192 C\nwhich induces a surjective ring homomorphism K(C\u0303) \u2192 K(C). In particular any\n \u0303\nrepresentation E \u2208 Irr(K(C)) can be considered as a representation \u1ebc \u2208 Irr(K(C)).\nIt is easy to see that f\u1ebc = 2fE for any E \u2208 Irr(K(C)). So by Corollary 2.8 we can\nassume that the category C is spherical fusion category.\nFinally the Drinfeld center of a spherical fusion category is a modular tensor\ncategory, see [M]. So applying Lemma 3.1 and Corollary 2.9 once again we see that\nit is enough to prove Theorem 1.2 for a modular tensor category C.\n3.3. Proof of Theorem 1.2 in the case when C is modular. Let C be a\nmodular tensor category. Let O(C) = {Xi }i\u2208I , let 0 \u2208 I be such that X0 = 1\nand let i 7\u2192 i\u2217 be the involution such that Xi\u2217 = Xi\u2217 . Let S = (sij )i,j\u2208I be the\nS\u2212matrix of the modular tensor category C, see e.g. [BK]. For any i \u2208 I the\ns\nextends by linearity to a ring homomorphism K(C) \u2192 k,\nassignment \u03c7i ([Xj ]) = sij\n0i\nmoreover any such homomorphism is \u03c7i for a well defined i \u2208 I, see loc. cit. In\nparticular we have\nsji\nsij\n=\n\u2208 A for all i, j \u2208 I\n(2)\ns0i\ns0i\nSince K(C) is commutative, any irreducible representation P\nof K(C) is of the form\nE\u03c7i , see Example 2.4. Using Example 2.4 and the identity j\u2208I sij sj \u2217 k = \u03b4ik (see\n[BK, 3.1.17]), one computes easily fE\u03c7i = s12 . Thus for g \u2208 Gal(Q\u0304/Q) we have\nfE\u03c7i\ng(fE\u03c7i )\n\n=\n\ng(s0i )2\n.\ns20i\n\n0i\n\nOn the other hand it is well known (see [dBG, CG] or [ENO,\n\nAppendix]) that there exists a permutation g : I \u2192 I such that g(sij ) = \u00b1sg(i)j .\nIn particular,\n\nfE\u03c7i\ng(fE\u03c7i )\n\n=\n\ns2g(0)i\ns20i\n\n\u2208 A and we are done by (2) and Lemma 2.7 (ii).\n\n\u0003\n\n3.4. Proof of Theorem 1.8. First we reduce proof of Theorem 1.8 to the case\nwhen C is modular. Let C\u0303 be the sphericalization of the category C; then C \u0303 is a\nbraided fusion category with a spherical structure and for any X \u2208 O(C) there\n\n\fON FORMAL CODEGREES OF FUSION CATEGORIES\n\n7\n\n \u0303 such that |X|2 = dim(X\u0303)2 . Thus by Corollary 2.9 it is enough to\nexists X\u0303 \u2208 O(C)\nprove the following:\n(a) Let C be a spherical braided fusion category. Then dim(X) is a d\u2212number\nfor any X \u2208 O(C).\nNext for any braided fusion category C we have a fully faithful functor C \u2192 Z(C);\nthis functor preserves dimensions in a case when C is spherical. Since the Drinfeld\ncenter of a spherical fusion category is a modular tensor category ([M]) we see that\n(a) is a consequence of the following:\n(b) Let C be a modular tensor category. Then dim(X) is a d\u2212number for any\nX \u2208 O(C).\n0i\n, see [BK, \u00a73.1].\nLet us prove (b). In the notation of \u00a73.3 we have dim(Xi ) = ss00\n\nThus for g \u2208 Gal(Q\u0304/Q) we have\nby (2) we have\n\ndim(Xi )\ng(dim(Xi ))\n\ndim(Xi )\ng(dim(Xi ))\n\n=\n\ns0i g(s00 )\ng(s0i )s00\n\n=\u00b1\n\nsg(i)g\u22121 (0)\ns0g(i)\n\n\u2208 A and we are done by Lemma 2.7 (ii).\n\n*\n\ns0g(0)\ns00 .\n\nThus\n\u0003\n\nReferences\n\u221a\n[AH] M.
