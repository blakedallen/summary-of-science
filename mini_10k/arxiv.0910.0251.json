In fact, it appears that stars share many similar formation processes over a wide range of stellar masses. As in the case of low-mass star formation, outflows have been observed ubiquitously towards forming intermediate and high-mass stars\n(e.g., Fuente et al. 2001; Shepherd & Churchwell 1996a; Zhang et al. 2005), and there exist\nexamples of stars as massive as early B-type surrounded by disks (e.g., Cesaroni et al. 2007).\nHowever, a key difference between these regimes is that the reduced Kelvin-Helmholtz\ncontraction timescale of massive protostars results in massive stars reaching the mainsequence while they are still accreting (Keto & Wood 2006, and references therein). Thus,\nwe expect the circumstellar material of these accreting embedded stars to be progressively\nengulfed by an expanding HII region, and to also be affected by strong stellar winds and\nradiation pressure. This fact may provide an explanation for why outflows and disks are\nnot commonly detected towards forming O stars (e.g., Shepherd 2003; Cesaroni et al. 2007),\nas the above processes may be responsible for quickly photoevaporating or dispersing the\ncircumstellar material. However, current observational biases may instead be responsible for\nthe lack of disk detections for the most massive stars.\nIn this work we aim to provide preliminary studies of a selection of sites containing\nintermediate- and high-mass star formation, specifically to uncover the presence of ionized\ngas towards them. We also wish to study the relationship between the star forming gas,\ntraced by millimeter continuum emission from dust, and the ionized gas created by massive\nstars, traced by radio continuum emission. We will select the most promising objects from\nthis study for follow up with higher resolution observations, to map any outflows or disks\ntowards these sources, and to study how the formation of an HII region affects the material\nwithin several hundreds of AU of the star. Therefore, we have selected sources that are\nwithin a declination range suitable for future study with Atacama Large Millimeter Array\n(ALMA) and the Expanded Very Large Array (EVLA).\nTo fulfill these aims, we have conducted radio continuum observations at 3.6 cm, using\nthe Very Large Array (VLA) of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory 1 , of 31 clumps\ndetected in previous millimeter continuum observations. Ten sources were selected from\n1\n\nThe National Radio Astronomy Observatory is a facility of the National Science Foundation operated\nunder cooperative agreement by Associated Universities, Inc.\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\npreliminary images from the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS, Aguirre et al. 2009, in\npreparation), and 5 were selected from Beltr\u00e1n et al. (2006, hereafter B06). The remaining\n16 sources were observed serendipitously, as their positions lay within the observed VLA\n3.6 cm fields. Note that, in this work, we adopt the terminology that a molecular core\nproduces a single star (or close binary system) while molecular clumps form clusters of stars.\nIn our study of massive star forming regions, our selected sources are several kiloparsecs\naway and, thus, we most likely detect clumps forming one or more massive stars along with\nmany lower mass stars.\nSection 2 presents our selection criteria for the observed millimeter sources. Section\n3 provides details of our observations and data reduction. Section 4 presents the observed\n3.6 cm continuum images of each field; lists the measured positions, fluxes, and angular\nsizes of each detected VLA source; compares these results to existing millimeter and mid-IR\nobservations; and presents derived properties for each source. Our discussion is presented in\nSection 5. Finally, our conclusions are given in Section 6.\n\n2.\n\nSOURCE SELECTION\n\nClumps of molecular gas which are in the process of collapsing to form stars contain dust\nat temperatures of several tens of Kelvin. This dust is assumed to radiate as a gray body - a\nblack body modified by a frequency dependent opacity, producing emission peaking at submillimeter and millimeter wavelengths. Thus observations in the millimeter regime are able\nto detect possible sites of star formation. The selected molecular clumps have masses large\nenough to harbor a forming intermediate or high-mass star, ranging from approximately 50\nto 2500 M\u2299 . Sources were chosen from BGPS preliminary images and the source list of B06.\nThe BGPS (Aguirre et al. 2009, in preparation) is a 1.1 mm continuum survey of 150 square\ndegrees of the Galactic Plane visible from the northern hemisphere, including a contiguous\nstrip from l = -10.5 to 86.5, b = \u00b10.5, as well as selected regions beyond the solar circle.\nThe survey has a limiting non-uniform 1-\u03c3 noise level in the range 20 and 50 mJy beam\u22121\nRMS at a resolution of 33\". The observations of B06 were taken with the 37-channel SEST\nImaging Bolometer Array (SIMBA) on the Swedish-ESO Submillimetre Telescope (SEST)\nto identify 1.2 mm continuum emission within a 15' by 6.6' region centered on selected IRAS\nsources. These observations have a resolution of 40\". Sources were chosen to have:\n1. A near distance of \u223c1 kpc, for clumps selected from the BGPS. A description of how\nthe BGPS clump distances were calculated is given in Section 2.1. However, HI observations subsequently showed many of the selected BGPS clumps to be at the far\ndistance (see Section 2.1). Clumps from B06 were selected to have distances given in\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\ntheir Table 1 of less than 4 kpc. Two of these sources however were also subsequently\nfound to be at the far distance.\n2. A clump mass greater than 1 M\u2299 at the near distance, with a preference for more\nmassive clumps. A description of how the BGPS source masses were calculated is\ngiven in Section 2.1. Masses of B06-selected sources are taken from their Table 2.\n3. Little or no associated emission in the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS, Condon et al.\n1993) 1.4 GHz continuum images and MSX E band (21.34 \u03bcm) images (Price et al.\n2001), suggesting that any massive protostellar objects are young, and/or deeply embedded. The RMS noise in the NVSS and MSX E band images is 0.45 mJy beam\u22121\n(in a synthesized beam size of 45\"), and \u226513.3 MJy sr\u22121 respectively.\n4. A declination between -20 and +40\u25e6 (J2000). The lower declination limit of the VLA\nis -48\u25e6, however, to ensure our observations had a reasonable beam shape, we chose\na lower declination limit of -20\u25e6 . To avoid excessive shadowing in ALMA's compact\nconfigurations in follow up studies, we chose an upper declination limit of +40\u25e6 .\nPreference was given to sources with no previous VLA observations at 3.6 cm that have\nsensitivities .30 \u03bcJy beam\u22121 . Fifteen sources were selected based on the above criteria while\nanother sixteen were serendipitously present within the observed fields. Table 1 presents\nthese sources, giving their positions; the velocity of associated 13 CO Galactic Ring Survey\n(Jackson et al. 2006, GRS) emission, if available; their near and far distances; the assumed\ndistance (near or far); the luminosity of associated IRAS sources; the millimeter flux (at\n1.1 or 1.2 mm); and the estimated mass of the millimeter clumps. Millimeter clumps that\nwere observed serendipitously are identified by \"Serend.\" in column 14 while clumps initially\nselected are identified by \"Select.\" The determination of the BGPS-selected source properties\ngiven in Table 1 is described in Section 2.1. B06-selected source properties in Table 1 are\ntaken from their Tables 1 and 2, apart from the exceptions described below.\nIt was possible to determine the velocities and distances of the clumps towards IRAS 184240329 and IRAS 18571+0349, using the same methods as for the BGPS-selected sources (outlined in Section 2.1). Clumps associated with IRAS 18424-0329 were found to be at the far\ndistance (see Section 2.1), and IRAS 18571+0349 was assumed to be at the far distance following the results of Kuchar & Bania (1994). Therefore the values of B06 are appropriately\nscaled to the far distance for these sources, and the velocity and distances found by the\nmethods in Section 2.1 are instead quoted in columns 6, 7 and 8 of Table 1.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n2.1.\n\nProperties of the BGPS Millimeter Sources\n\nThe BGPS sources were identified by eye in preliminary BGPS images, prior to the\nfinal data release (Aguirre et al. 2009, in preparation). Several of the sources are not\nincluded in the final BGPS catalog (Rosolowsky et al. 2009), which is designed to minimize\nfalse detections, however sources were confirmed by detection of morphologically similar\nemission in the 13 CO(J=1-0) channel maps of the Boston University-Five College Radio\nAstronomy Observatory Galactic Ring Survey (Jackson et al. 2006, GRS). In order to extract\nflux densities for our objects, we reprocessed the images using the BGPS catalog pipeline,\nseeding the source identification portion of the catalog with the by-eye positions. This\nenabled the catalog routine to extract source properties that directly correspond to the\nfields observed. Source properties are determined as per the BGPS catalog; the integrated\nflux densities listed in Table 1 are determined using the same method as the flux density S in\nRosolowsky et al. (2009). The quoted uncertainties for the integrated flux densities shown in\nTable 1 are due to the photometry only; an additional 11% error should be added to account\nfor the uncertainty in the absolute flux calibration (10% random and 5% systematic, Aguirre\net al. 2009, in preparation).\nDistances to BGPS-selected molecular clumps were determined using velocities of the\ncorresponding 13 CO emission. The velocity vR of each source was measured from the GRS\n13\nCO channel maps, taking the mean velocity of the associated 13 CO cloud at the source\nposition. The distances of the clumps were calculated assuming a flat Galactic rotation\ncurve, and circular orbits around the center of the Galaxy. IAU values were assumed for the\nradius of the Sun's orbit around the galaxy R\u2299 , and the velocity of the Sun around the galaxy\nv\u2299 (R\u2299 = 8.5 \u00b1 1.1 kpc, v\u2299 = 222 \u00b1 20 kms\u22121 , Kerr & Lynden-Bell 1986). Uncertainties of\nthe calculated distances were estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation, assuming Gaussian\nerrors for R\u2299 , v\u2299 and the measured velocity vR .\nFollowing a similar method to that outlined in Roman-Duval et al. (2009), distance\nambiguities were resolved by examining HI channel maps from the VLA Galactic Plane\nSurvey (VGPS, Stil et al. 2006) towards each source. Two methods of distance determination\nwere used. Firstly, the HI channel maps were inspected for HI self-absorption at the velocity\nassigned to each millimeter clump. Cool HI in the outer layers of clouds can absorb emission\nfrom the warm diffuse galactic HI background; clouds at the near distance should show HI\nself-absorption of diffuse HI emission at the far distance, whereas clouds at the far distance\nwill not since there is no background to absorb. It should be noted, however, that the\npresence of 21 cm continuum emission from HII regions in the cloud in question can provide\na background to absorb even at the far distance. Therefore, a second method of distance\ndetermination was employed for sources that displayed HI absorption at the same velocity\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nas the cloud, but also significant 21 cm emission with the same morphology. This continuum\nemission can also be absorbed by clouds in the line of sight. If the cloud is at the near\ndistance, the HI channel maps and profile will exhibit absorption features at velocities only\nless than that of the cloud, and if the cloud is at the far distance, there will be absorption\nfeatures present up to the tangent point velocity (see Figure 2 of Roman-Duval et al. 2009).\nTable 1, column 9, indicates whether the near or far distance has been chosen based on the\nabove methods, indicating whether presence or lack of HI self-absorption (HISA) or 21 cm\ncontinuum absorption (CA) was the deciding factor.\nWe were able to determine the velocities and distances to the clumps associated with\nIRAS 18424-0329 and IRAS 18571+0349 using the above methods, as they have corresponding GRS and VGPS data. The clumps toward IRAS 18424-0329 were found to be at the far\ndistance. The distances for the clumps toward IRAS 18571+0349 could not unambiguously\nbe determined using the above methods, however HI observations by Kuchar & Bania (1994)\nfound the molecular cloud towards these sources to be at the far distance. Therefore the\nluminosities and masses quoted in B06 for these sources are accordingly scaled to the far\ndistance.\nSeveral of the selected clumps lie within the GRS clouds with distance determinations\nlisted in Roman-Duval et al. (2009). These clouds are: GRSMC G029.14-00.16, GRSMC G048.59+00.04,\nGRSMC G048.84+00.24, and GRSMC G050.29-00.46, which were all determined to be at the\nfar distance, in agreement with our results.\nThe luminosities of IRAS sources associated with BGPS-selected millimeter clumps (at\nthe distances given in Table 1) were calculated by first integrating the flux under the four\n12 to 100 \u03bcm IRAS fluxes, and then adding the integrated flux of a blackbody peaking\nat 100 \u03bcm for wavelengths longer than 100 \u03bcm. When an upper limit was given for any\nof the four IRAS fluxes, the upper limit to the integrated flux was found by integrating\nunder these values, and the corresponding lower limit was then found by setting the fluxes\nin question to zero before integration. When two values for the IRAS luminosity are given\nin Table 1, separated by a dash, they denote the lower and upper limits to the luminosity\nrespectively. Uncertainties in the IRAS luminosity due to the distance uncertainty are not\ngiven in Table 1, however these can be found by scaling the given luminosities to the upper\nand lower distance limits.\nThe masses of the observed BGPS clumps were found using the equation\n\nMgas =\n\ngS\u03bd d2\nB(\u03bd, T )\u03ba\u03bd\n\n(1)\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nwhere g is the gas-to-dust ratio, taken to be 100, S\u03bd is the integrated flux density, d is the\nclump distance, B(\u03bd, T ) is the black body function, which is a function of frequency \u03bd and\ntemperature T , and \u03ba\u03bd is the frequency-dependent opacity. We have assumed a temperature\nof 30 K for all sources, as a compromise between the dust and NH3 temperature results of\nSridharan et al. (2002), who found an average dust temperature from IRAS emission towards\ntheir selection of high-mass stellar objects of 40 K, and an average rotation temperature from\n(1, 1) and (2, 2) lines of NH3 of 20 K. Following Enoch et al. (2006), we assumed an opacity\nof 1.14 cm2 g\u22121 at 1.1 mm, derived from the results of Ossenkopf & Henning (1994).\nThe uncertainties in the 1.1 mm flux density vary from \u223c 10-60%. The temperatures of\nthe observed clumps also may lie between 15 and 60 K (from both NH3 and dust temperature\nmeasurements from Sridharan et al. 2002). Assuming the Rayleigh-Jeans approximation\nholds, mass is approximately inversely proportional to temperature. Therefore the maximum\nerror in the temperature, which is assumed to be 30 K, is 100% when T=60 K, and will give\nrise to the same error in the mass. Table 1 shows that the uncertainty in the clump distances\nlies in the range 10-20%, therefore contributes an error of 40%. The opacity is uncertain by a\nfactor of two or less (Ossenkopf & Henning 1994), and the gas-to-dust ratio has been derived,\nusing extinction and gas-phase abundance measurements respectively, to be approximately\n100 and 140 (Draine et al. 2007), giving an error of at least 40%. Therefore the calculated\nmasses are accurate to within a factor of approximately 2, as the uncertainty is dominated\nby the uncertainty in the opacity.\n\n3.\n\nOBSERVATIONS\n\nThe selected millimeter sources were observed on two occasions with the D configuration\nof the National Radio Astronomy Observatory VLA, in 3.6 cm (8.4 GHz) continuum mode\non 2007 April 6 and on 2007 May 1, under the program AS895. VLA continuum mode\nconsists of four bands, each having 50 MHz bandwidth; two of these bands are centered on\na frequency of 8.435 GHz, and the remaining two are centered on 8.485 GHz. The baseline\nlengths in D array range from 35 m to 1.03 km, resulting in the largest angular scale of\nobservable structure being approximately 3' at 3.6 cm. However, note this value was lower\nin some instances due to flagging of the shortest baselines during data reduction. The average\nangular resolution of our final images is 8.35\".\nThe on-source integration time for each observation was approximately 30 minutes,\nwhich corresponds to a theoretical RMS noise of \u223c 30 \u03bcJy beam\u22121 , and \u223c 20 \u03bcJy beam\u22121\nin overlap regions of mosaiced fields. Twenty-six antennas were available for the first set\nof observations, and twenty-five were available during the second. The data were taken\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nduring the transition to the new VLA correlator controller, which resulted in there being a\nlarger fraction of data than expected with poor phases or amplitudes that had to be flagged,\ndecreasing the final sensitivity in the images. As well as flagging to remove erroneous data,\nsome of the shorter baselines were flagged to improve the final images, when bright, largescale structure could not be adequately imaged. The percentage of data flagged for each\nfield ranged from 33 to 47%. These values include \u223c10% of the data that was previously\nflagged by the on-line system.\nThe pointing centers for most target fields were shifted between the April 6 and May 1\nobservations (presented in Table 2). This was done primarily to move several bright sources\non the edge of the VLA fields closer to the phase center of the map, to improve image\ndeconvolution. For most of the observations, 1922+155 was used as a phase calibrator,\nwith the exception of the source IRAS 18256-0742, which used 1822-096, and IRAS 184240329 and IRAS 18586+0106 which used 1832-105. The fluxes found during calibration for\n1822-096, 1832-105 and 1922+155 were 1.34, 1.43 and 0.68 Jy, respectively.\nData reduction was carried out using the Common Astronomy Software Applications\n(CASA)2 package. The phase calibrator 1922+155 was extended, and therefore self-calibration\nwas performed on 1922+155 before deriving and applying phase calibration to the target\nsource data. The primary flux calibrator was 1331+305 (3C286), which has a flux of 5.23 Jy\nat a wavelength of 3.6 cm. We used a model of 1331+305 for flux calibration, as this source\nwas slightly resolved, allowing data at all UV distances to be used for flux calibration. The\nerror in absolute flux calibration is approximately 2%. All of the data, with the exception\nof IRAS 18256-0742 and IRAS 18586+0106, were imaged with CASA's multi-scale mosaic\ndeconvolution routine, which is based on the CLEAN algorithm, using either three or four\nscales. Imaging of the remaining two sources was performed using multi-scale CLEAN, as\nthey share the same pointing center in both observations.\n\n4.\n\nRESULTS\n\nPanels a) and b) of Figures 1 to 10 present images of the VLA 3.6 cm continuum emission\ntracing ionized gas, and the millimeter continuum emission from the BGPS and B06 tracing\nwarm dust, in the 10 observed fields. Panel a) of Figures 1 to 10 presents the observed VLA\n3.6 cm fields in grayscale and contours. Panel b) of Figures 1 to 10 compares the 3.6 cm\nimages, in contours, to the corresponding BGPS 1.1 mm or SEST SIMBA 1.2 mm images\n(from B06), shown in grayscale. The BGPS 1.1 mm images have been Gaussian smoothed\n2\n\nhttp://casa.nrao.edu\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nusing \u03c3 =1.5 pixels.\nHereafter, sources selected from the BGPS will be quoted in the format G44.587, as\nthis is sufficient to discriminate between them. Several of the observed BGPS sources are\nclose enough to one another to be shown in the same figure; these are G44.587 & G44.661,\nG48.580 & G48.616, G48.598 & G48.656, and G50.271 & G50.283.\nThe noise in the 3.6 cm images was found not to be Gaussian, due to poor UV coverage of\nextended and very bright emission in the observed fields (causing stripes in the deconvolved\nimages). Therefore an estimate of the noise in the image \u2206S was taken to be above any\nresidual artifacts. The 3.6 cm contour levels presented in Figures 1 to 10 are given in\nmultiples of \u2206S.\n\n4.1.\n\nPositions, Fluxes and Angular Sizes of Detected 3.6 cm Sources\n\nIn the 10 observed fields, 35 HII regions are identified, of which 20 are newly discovered. Table 3 lists the integrated flux density, peak position, peak flux density, angular size,\nposition angle, and solid angle for each VLA source detected above 5\u00d7\u2206S in the observed\nfields. Also listed in the final column of Table 3 are any pre-existing identifiers for each VLA\nsource. For newly discovered radio continuum sources, this column contains the flag \"New\".\nSub-sources are denoted by \"A,B,C...\", and components of sources which are fully or nearly\nunresolved (e.g., point-like), are denoted by \"-P.\"\nWith the exception of point-like sources (-P), measurements of the integrated and peak\nflux density were carried out using a custom-made irregular aperture photometry program.\nThe integrated flux density was measured using a 1\u00d7\u2206S cut-off, within apertures placed so\nthat they included all of the 1\u00d7\u2206S contour for each source. Errors in the aperture fluxes\nwere calculated to be a combination of the error due to the image noise over the aperture,\nand the VLA absolute flux error, which is 2% for our observations. Similarly, the peak flux\nerror was found by combining the 1\u00d7\u2206S flux density with the VLA absolute flux error.\nThe apertures for source sub-components were unavoidably arbitrary, as they cut across\n1\u00d7\u2206S contours or higher. Therefore we have provided Figure 11 to show the chosen apertures\nfor sub-sources, denoted by \"A,B,C...\" in Table 3. In addition to the noise and absolute flux\nerrors mentioned above, which are accounted for and quoted for each sub-component in Table\n3, an additional 10-20% uncertainty in the integrated flux density should also be included\nfor sub-sources, to account for the arbitrary placing of apertures.\nValues for the solid angle quoted in Table 3 are given for irregular or extended sources\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nonly, and are derived from the number of pixels above the 1\u00d7\u2206S within each photometry\naperture.\nFor all extended sources, the angular size of the source at the 3\u00d7\u2206S level was measured\nby taking the major axis of the source to be along the direction which it is most extended,\nto within a position angle of 10 degrees.\nThe peak and integrated flux densities, the angular size, and the position angle of fully\nor nearly unresolved sources (-P) were determined using the AIPS task IMFIT.\nThe reported peak positions are measured from the peak pixel of the source, except for\nfully or nearly unresolved sources, whose peak positions are determined from the peak in the\nfitted Gaussian.\nDue to the removal of some of the shortest baselines (c.f. \u00a73), and the fact that VLA\nD array observations are initially sensitive to size scales less than 3', some of the measured\n3.6 cm source flux densities may suffer from missing extended flux. This would have an impact\non the derived properties of these sources by, for example, underestimating the luminosities\nand masses of their exciting stars (see Sections 4.3 and 5.4).\n\n4.2.\n\nAnalysis of Individual Fields\n\nPanel c) of Figures 1 to 10 presents a three-color (Red: 8\u03bcm, Green: 4.5\u03bcm, Blue:\n3.6\u03bcm) Spitzer IRAC (Fazio et al. 2004) GLIMPSE (Benjamin et al. 2003) image of the\nobserved fields, or an MSX (Price et al. 2001) A Band (8.28\u03bcm) image for the two observed\nVLA fields not covered by the GLIMPSE survey, overlaid with contours of VLA 3.6 cm\nemission.\nTable 4 provides a summary of the evolutionary indicators associated with each millimeter clump. Column 2 of Table 4 lists whether there is 3.6 cm emission detected within\n60\" of each clump peak position, and columns 3 to 7 list whether maser emission, dense gas\ntracers, GLIMPSE or MSX mid-IR emission, outflows, or IRAS sources have been detected\ntowards each clump. The final column of Table 4 provides the IRAS luminosities of the\nassociated IRAS sources, calculated using the method outlined in Section 2.1.\nIn the following subsections, Spitzer GLIMPSE point-source catalog names have been\nshortened to start with \"GL\" (e.g., SSTGLMC G044.6598+00.3503 is shortened to be\nGL044.6598+00.3503). A single source from the GLIMPSE Archive (indicating the photometry is less reliable) is indicated with the full name SSTGLMA G050.3179-00.4186.\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\n4.2.1. G44.587 & G44.661\nThe G44.587 & G44.661 field (Figure 1) contains two 3.6 cm sources. VLA 1 is in the\nfar S-W of the image, and is associated with the millimeter source G44.521. VLA 2 is found\nnear the centre of the field, close to the millimeter source G44.617. There is no significant\nionized emission found towards either G44.587 or G44.661.\nThe GLIMPSE image of the G44.587 & G44.661 field, presented in Figure 1c), shows\nthat there are clusters of mid-IR sources and diffuse 8.0 \u03bcm emission associated with each\nof the three millimeter clumps. The inset panels show the areas marked by white boxes in\nthe main panel, which surround the millimeter sources (corresponding from top to bottom)\nG44.661, G44.587, and G44.521.\nThe GLIMPSE source GL044.6598+00.3503, associated with the millimeter clump G44.661,\nand marked by a light blue circle in Figure 1c), has both IRAC colors [3.6] - [4.5] and [5.8]\n- [8.0] greater than 0.6 suggesting that the source is deeply embedded (Allen et al. 2004).\nThere are also two extended mid-IR sources to the North-West and South of GL044.6598+00.3503.\nThe millimeter clump G44.587 is associated with a cluster of GLIMPSE sources which\nhave positive IRAC colors or rising mid-IR SEDs: GL044.5823+00.3689, GL044.5901+00.3697,\nGL044.5914+00.3689, and GL044.5802+00.3660 (marked by a yellow, light green, red, and\nturquoise circle respectively). This is also the case for G44.521, which is associated with\nGL044.5215+00.3902, GL044.5223+00.3858, GL044.5206+0.3866, and GL044.5231+00.3828\n(marked by dark green, orange, dark blue, and magenta circles respectively). Both the reddened and clustered nature of these sources suggest that the millimeter clumps G44.521,\nG44.587, and G44.661 are associated with star forming clusters. However, the lack of ionized emission towards these clusters suggests that their members are either low-mass or very\nyoung.\n\n4.2.2. G48.580 & G48.616\nFigure 2 shows that there are six sources detected in the G48.580 & G48.616 field with\n3.6 cm emission greater than 5\u00d7\u2206S. The emission is dominated by the HII region VLA 5, the\nmost extended source in the field; the integrated flux of VLA 5 is 3.23 Jy, constituting \u223c 3/4\nof the total emission from sources in the field brighter than 5\u00d7\u2206S. Both VLA 4 and VLA 5\nconsist of several components. VLA 4 has a compact component to the South, (VLA 4A) and\nan extended component to the North (VLA 4B). VLA 5 consists of an extended Western\ncomponent, approximately extended along the NE-SW direction (VLA 5A), two compact\ncomponents which also include some fainter diffuse emission (VLA 5C and VLA 5D being\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nthe NE and SE components respectively), and a component which extends from VLA 5D\nto the South-East: VLA 5B. The edge of VLA 5A is associated with the millimeter source\nG48.580. The sources VLA 5B, VLA 5C, and VLA 5D are associated with the millimeter\nclump G48.605.\nVLA 5 has been observed previously by many authors; it is known most commonly as\nG48.6+0.0 or IRAS 19181+1349. HI, OH and H2 CO absorption have been detected towards\nVLA 5 (Caswell et al. 1975; Silverglate & Terzian 1978; Wilson et al. 1978; Downes et al.\n1980; Kuchar & Bania 1994), placing this source at the far kinematic distance, between 10.3\nand 12.0 kpc. This is consistent with our determination that the millimeter sources G48.580\nand G48.605, are at the far distance (d \u223c 10 kpc, see Section 2.1).\nVLA 5A, 5B, 5C, and 5D have been observed in radio continuum observations by\nMatthews et al. (1978), Zoonematkermani et al. (1990), and Kurtz et al. (1999, using the\nVLA D array at 3.6 cm, see their Figure 7). Although the integration time of our original\nD array observations of this field was four times longer than those of Kurtz et al. (1999), we\nobtained the same sensitivity in our final image (1.2 mJy beam\u22121 ). Nevertheless, we show\nour image as it presents a larger field of view which covers both millimeter sources G48.580\nand G48.616.\nIn addition, 5C and 5D were observed at higher resolution by Kurtz et al. (1994), at 2\nand 3.6 cm with the VLA in B array. We calculated the spectral index of VLA 5C and VLA\n5D between 2 and 3.6 cm, using only the B array flux densities given in Kurtz et al. (1994),\nas they result from the most similar UV coverages. We take S\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u03b1 , where \u03b1 is the spectral\nindex. The spectral index of VLA 5C, named G48.609+0.027 by Kurtz et al. (1994), was\nfound to be -0.4\u00b10.2, which is consistent with mixed thermal and non-thermal (synchrotron)\nemission from ionized gas. The spectral indices of the two components of VLA 5D resolved\nby the VLA B array observations, G48.606+0.023 and G48.606+0.024, were found to be\n0.2\u00b10.1 and 0.3\u00b10.5 respectively, which are consistent with an ionized wind or optically\nthick free-free emission. However, in the case of G48.606+0.024, the larger error also allows\nthe spectral index to be explained by optically thin free-free emission.\nDe Buizer et al. (2005) have performed a high resolution (\u223c1-2\") mid-infrared survey towards sites of water maser emission, in which mid-IR emission was detected towards VLA 5C\nand VLA 5D. Both water and hydroxyl masers have been detected toward VLA 5D (e.g.,\nForster & Caswell 1989), and a wealth of molecular tracers have also been observed (e.g.\nCS(J=7-6) and CO(J=3-2) Plume et al. 1992). Mueller et al. (2002) have also detected the\nsource in the far-IR, at 350\u03bcm. These detections, in combination with the coincidence of\nVLA 5D with the millimeter source G48.605, suggest this source is at a very early stage of\nevolution.\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nFigure 2c) presents a GLIMPSE image of the G48.580 & G48.616 field. The crosses mark\nthe positions of the millimeter clumps (in increasing R.A.: G48.616, G48.540, G48.580, and\nG48.605). The inner panel shows the sources VLA 5B, 5C and 5D, and covers the area shown\nby the black box in the main panel. Comparison between the GLIMPSE and VLA 3.6 cm\nimages reveals that VLA 5B is associated with the GLIMPSE source GL048.6021+00.0257,\nand VLA 5C is associated with the GLIMPSE source GL048.6093+00.0270 (whose positions\nare shown by a yellow and blue circle respectively in Figure 2c). There are no mid-IR IRAC\nsources directly associated with the peak of the compact HII region VLA 5D, in fact the\nsource appears to lie within a dark filament. However, VLA 5D appears to have associated\n4.5 \u03bcm emission (green) extending in the N-S direction. Emission in the 4.5 \u03bcm band is\nthought to be produced by shocked H2 or CO gas in outflows (see Cyganowski et al. 2008,\nand references within). If we are seeing shocked gas from the outflow of this source, this\nprovides further evidence towards its youth, and suggests it may still be in the process of\noutflow and accretion.\nIn summary, there are several newly discovered HII regions in the field, for example\nVLA 1 and VLA 3. However these HII regions are not coincident with any BGPS clumps.\nIn contrast, the extended bright HII region VLA 5 contains several compact components:\nVLA 5B, C and D, of which two have spectral indices that can not be explained by optically\nthin free-free emission expected from classical HII regions. There are also many indicators of\n(massive) star formation towards these components, in particular VLA 5D, including mid-IR,\nmazer, and 350\u03bcm emission. Therefore we conclude that VLA 5 is a current site of massive\nstar formation.\n\n4.2.3. G48.598 & G48.656\nFigure 3 shows there are six 3.6 cm sources in the G48.598 & G48.656 field. VLA 1\nis a diffuse extended source, lying along the NW-SE direction. VLA 2 is an unresolved\nsource, found to the South of VLA 1. VLA 3 is again an unresolved source, and VLA 4 is a\nroughly circular source to the West of VLA 5. VLA 5 is a complex extended source, with 6\ncomponents (A to F in increasing R.A., which are labeled in Figure 11). Component VLA 5C\nis composed of a brighter unresolved source surrounded by fainter extended emission. VLA 6\nis also unresolved, with the brightest peak flux in the field (25.5 mJy beam\u22121 ).\nVLA 4 is coincident with the millimeter source G48.634, and VLA 5D is coincident\nwith G48.656. The millimeter source G48.610 is also associated with slightly resolved 3.6 cm\nemission at the 4\u00d7\u2206S level.\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nSridharan et al. (2002) have carried out VLA B array observations of this field at\n3.6 cm, with a sensitivity of 0.1 mJy beam\u22121 . As the 3.6 cm images were not presented\nin Sridharan et al. (2002), we downloaded the data from the NRAO archive3 (observation\ndate: 1998 July 2, project code: AS643) and imaged the field around the observed source\n19175+1357, which is coincident with G48.634. Sources VLA 5C and VLA 6 were detected\nin their B array observations; Figure 12 presents both B and D array observations of these\nsources in its right hand panels, with the B array image shown in contours, and the D array\nimage in grayscale. The subcomponent VLA 5C, which is observed as an unresolved source\nin the D array observations at 3.6 cm, is resolved into a double-peaked source in the B array\nobservations, the North-West lobe being its brightest component. VLA 6 is also detected as\nfaint (\u223c5-\u03c3) emission in the B array observations, which contains two 5-\u03c3 peaks.\nThe distance toward G48.598 and G48.656 has been determined, using observations of\nradio recombination lines (H110\u03b1 and H138\u03b2), and H2 CO and HI absorption, to be between\n10.5 and 12.5 kpc (Watson et al. 2003; Kuchar & Bania 1994; Planesas et al. 1991). This is\nconsistent with our determination that these sources are at the far distance, with distances\nof 10.6 and 10.3 kpc respectively (see Section 2.1).\nBeuther et al. (2002) has observed the field at 1.2 mm using the MAMBO bolometer\narray at the IRAM 30 m telescope. Comparing their Figure 1, panel 19175+1357, to the\nBolocam observations of the field shown in Figure 3 of this work, one can see that very similar\ndust structures are traced by the two sets of observations. The MAMBO resolution of 11\" at\n1.2 mm resolves both millimeter sources G48.634 and G48.610 into two components; these\nare identified by Beuther et al. as sources 1 and 2, and 4 and 5 respectively. Source 1 is\ncoincident with the HII region VLA 4, and G48.598 and G48.656 correspond respectively to\nsources 6 and 7. Williams et al. (2004) have observed G48.634 at 450 and 850 \u03bcm, detecting\ntwo sources: WFS70 and WFS71, whose positions are proximate to the Beuther et al. sources\n19175+1357: 2 and 1 respectively (with offsets of 2.9\" and 6.2\").\nFigure 3c) shows a three-color Spitzer IRAC GLIMPSE image of the G48.598 & G48.656\nfield, overlaid with contours of the VLA 3.6 cm emission. The white crosses mark the positions of the millimeter clumps (in increasing R.A.: G48.598, G48.610, G48.634, and G48.656).\nThe two right panels show the areas of the Spitzer IRAC image marked by white boxes in\nthe left panel, and are also overlaid with contours of 3.6 cm emission. The bottom right\npanel shows the IRAC emission towards G48.634. There are two extended sources shown in\nthis panel, one to the North which is associated with VLA 4, and a smaller extended source\nto the south, which is coincident with 19175+1357: 2, and WFS70. By studying the separate\n3\n\nhttp://archive.cv.nrao.edu/\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nIRAC band images, the Northern source was found to contain three point sources superimposed upon the extended emission, at approximately 19h 19m 49s .2 +14\u25e6 02'49\", 19h 19m 49s .0\n+14\u25e6 02'46\" and 19h 19m 48s .6 +14\u25e6 02'52\" (J2000). The top right panel shows a close up of\nthe IRAC emission towards VLA 6. The mid-IR emission associated with this source is\nmostly extended, and is therefore not in the GLIMPSE catalog. However there is a central\npoint source seen in IRAC band 1, at 19h 19m 55s .5 +14\u25e6 04'58\" (J2000).\nThe GLIMPSE source GL048.6557+00.2285 appears to be associated with VLA 5D,\nand the source GL048.6024+00.2394 is close to VLA 2. The position of these two GLIMPSE\nsources are shown in Figure 3c) by a blue and yellow circle respectively. In addition, two\nextended GLIMPSE sources are associated with the millimeter source G48.598, near VLA 2,\nwith positions 19h 19m 41s .6 +14\u25e6 01'19\" and 19h 19m 42s .1 +14\u25e6 01'24\".\nBy comparing the 3.6 cm, 1.1 mm and GLIMPSE images, we have shown there are\nseveral sites of massive star formation in the G48.598 & G48.656 field. Two examples are\nVLA 4 and VLA 5D, which are coincident with several signposts of massive star formation\n(e.g. dust continuum, mid-IR and ionized gas emission).\n\n4.2.4. G48.751\nThere is one faint (Fpeak =0.431 mJy beam\u22121 ) VLA 3.6 cm source detected above 5\u00d7\u2206S\nin the G48.751 field shown in Figure 4. This source is not associated with any of the detected\nBolocam millimeter sources in the field. There is a nearby IRAS source, IRAS 19191+1352,\nhowever it is not related to any millimeter or 3.6 cm continuum emission. The extended\nGLIMPSE source GL048.7750-00.1507 (whose position is shown by a yellow circle in Figure\n4c) is \u223c 20\" from the peak of G48.771, but still appears to be associated with the extended\nmillimeter dust emission towards this source. There is also extended 8\u03bcm emission covering a\nlarge proportion of the bottom half of Figure 4c), which extends to the South of G48.751 and\nVLA 1. Therefore it appears that the G48.751 field contains two mostly quiescent clumps,\none of which may now contain a protostar shown in the mid-IR by GL048.7750-00.1507.\n\n4.2.5. G49.912\nThe 3.6 cm image of the G49.912 field shown in Figure 5 uncovers no significant emission\nfrom ionized gas towards G49.912. However there is a double-lobed 3.6 cm source, VLA 1,\nin the S-W of the field, which is associated with the millimeter source G49.830.\nFigure 5c) shows a three-colour GLIMPSE image of the region. The white crosses\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nmark the positions of the millimeter clumps (in increasing R.A.: G49.830 and G49.912).\nFigure 5c) shows that there is a cluster of mid-IR sources associated with G49.912 (see\ninset panel, which covers the area marked by the top white box in the main panel). The\nmost conspicuous source in the cluster at these wavelengths is an extended mid-IR source\nat 19h 21m 48s .1 +15\u25e6 14'32\" (J2000). There are several other mid-IR sources in the cluster\nhaving IRAC colors which suggest they are young objects. The sources GL049.9113+00.3719\nand GL049.9134+00.3723 (indicated by a yellow and green circle respectively in Figure 5c)\nboth have IRAC [3.6] - [4.5] and [5.8] - [8.0] colors greater than 0.6 showing that they are\ndeeply embedded. This, in combination with the clustering of these sources and the presence\nof an associated millimeter clump, provides evidence that these stars constitute a young star\nforming cluster. However, as we observe no significant ionized gas emission towards G49.912,\nit appears that there are either no stars in the cluster massive enough to produce significant\nfree-free emission, or that any forming massive stars have not yet reached the main sequence.\nEmission at 8 \u03bcm can originate from Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) which\nare thought to fluoresce at the boundaries of HII regions (Churchwell et al. 2004), and,\nindeed, the 8 \u03bcm emission associated with the HII region VLA 1A & 1B traces the edges\nof the two observed lobes of ionized gas (Figure 5c, right panel). The presence of PAH\nemission near the boundaries of this bipolar, ionized gas structure suggests that VLA 1A &\n1B represent the bipolar, ionized outflow lobes from a massive star or star cluster rather\nthan an extragalactic radio galaxy. The morphology of IRAC emission is also similar to the\nbipolar bubble (S97 and S98) observed by Churchwell et al. (2006, see their Figure 2f).\nThere is an extended mid-IR source lying between the two lobes of the VLA 1, slightly\noffset to the West of the axis of this bipolar source, which the shape of the 3.6 cm emission\ncan be seen to follow. It may be that this extended mid-IR source marks the current site of\nstar formation towards VLA 1.\nTherefore the presented observations reveal that there is star forming cluster embedded\nin the clump G49.912 which may only be forming low-mass stars, or has not yet formed\na massive star detectable in our 3.6 cm observations. In contrast, the clump G49.830 is\ncoincident with an evolved bipolar HII region, however there is a mid-IR source which may\nbe the site of current star formation in this clump.\n\n4.2.6. G50.271 & G50.283\nThere are four 3.6 cm continuum sources detected above 5\u00d7\u2206S in the G50.271 &\nG50.283 field (Figure 6). VLA 1 dominates the integrated flux in the region; the source\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\nhas an extended peak which is elongated in roughly the E-W direction, and two fainter\nlobes. The main lobe extends to the North, and the second to the S-E. The source VLA 2\nis to the S-E of VLA 1, detected at the 5\u00d7\u2206S level. VLA 3 is a double-lobed source, and\nVLA 4 is an unresolved source in the far S-E of the field.\nVLA 1 is coincident with the millimeter source G50.283, however the peak of the ionized\ngas emission is slightly offset (14\") from the millimeter peak. There is no significant 3.6 cm\nemission associated with the other millimeter source in the field, G50.271.\nUsing H110\u03b1 recombination line and H2 CO absorption observations, Watson et al. (2003)\nfound the distance to VLA 1 to be 10.0 kpc. This is consistent with our determination that\nthe source is at a far distance of \u223c 9.6 kpc (see Section 2.1).\nFigure 6c) shows a three-color GLIMPSE image of the G50.271 & G50.283 field, overlaid\nwith contours of the VLA 3.6 cm emission. The white crosses mark the positions of the\nmillimeter clumps (in increasing R.A.: G50.283, and G50.271). The inset panel shows a\nclose up of the IRAC emission associated with G50.283 (also VLA 1), the area of which is\nmarked by the white box in the main panel. From Figure 6c) we see that the 8 \u03bcm PAH\nemission associated with VLA 1 traces out the edges of the Northern lobe of ionized gas,\nwhich is similar to the IRAC emission associated with VLA 1 in Figure 5c).\nThe GLIMPSE source GL050.2830-00.3904 (indicated by a blue circle in Figure 6c),\nwhich is located within the HII region VLA 1, is coincident with the peak of G50.283. There\nis also a diffuse 4.5 \u03bcm extension of GL050.2830-00.3904 that points into the main Northern\nlobe, which may be either tracing a less luminous source, or instead is shocked emission from\nan outflow associated with GL050.2830-00.3904. Thus, the mid-IR emission from G50.283,\nin conjunction with the existence of warm dust and ionized gas shown by the \u223c1 mm and\n3.6 cm images, points to this being a site of current massive star formation. There is a fainter\npoint source, not listed in the GLIMPSE catalogs, at 19h 25m 18s .49 +15\u25e6 12'28.5\" (J2000),\nwhich is closer to the peak position of VLA 1 than GL050.2830-00.3904. It is possible that\nthis instead is the source creating the HII region VLA 1. A saturated GLIMPSE source,\nSSTGLMA G050.3179-00.4186 (indicated by a red circle in Figure 6c), is associated with\nVLA 3B. There is also diffuse IRAC emission near the millimeter source G50.271; however,\nas there are no associated IRAC point sources and no coincident ionized gas emission, this\nclump appears to be quiescent, or at an early stage of star formation.\nTherefore we conclude that VLA 1, which is coincident with the millimeter clump\nG50.283, is a site of current massive star formation, and that the clump G50.271 is quiescent or in a very early stage of star formation.\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\n4.2.7. IRAS 18256-0742\nThe VLA 3.6 cm image of the IRAS 18256-0742 region, shown in Figure 7, contains\nfive sources. VLA 1, 3 and 5 are compact sources, whilst VLA 2 and 4 are extended.\nVLA 2 is associated with the millimeter Clump 1 in the IRAS 18256-0742 field observed\nby B06. Molinari et al. (1998) have previously detected the source VLA 5 at 6 cm using B\nconfiguration VLA observations.\nAs there is no GLIMPSE coverage of this field, an MSX A band image of the field at\n8.28\u03bcm is shown in Figure 7c). There is 8\u03bcm emission associated with VLA 2 and millimeter\nClump 1. Therefore this clump is likely to be a current site of massive star formation. There\nis also a \"shell\" of 8\u03bcm emission surrounding VLA 4, tracing PAH emission at the boundary\nof the HII region. As the HII region VLA 4 is approximately circular, has a diameter of\nalmost a parsec, and is not associated with any dense gas traced by millimeter emission, we\nconclude that it is more evolved than VLA 2.\n\n4.2.8. IRAS 18424-0329\nFigure 8 shows that there are two 3.6 cm continuum sources detected in the IRAS 184240329 field. VLA 1 is a compact unresolved source in the South of the field, and VLA 2 is\ncometary in shape and lies close to the field center. VLA 2 is also associated with millimeter\nemission detected in the field (shown in the panel b of Figure 8). B06 find three millimeter\nclumps listed to be within \u223c 1' of VLA 2: Clumps 2, 4, and 6. The given positions of these\nthree clumps are shown by small circles in the panel b) of Figure 8. The peak of VLA 2 lies\nclosest to Clump 2. Becker et al. (1994) have previously observed both VLA 1 and 2 at 1.4\nand 5 GHz, and Molinari et al. (1998) have also detected VLA 1 at 6 cm.\nAs can be seen from the GLIMPSE image of the region (Figure 8c) there is diffuse 8.0\u03bcm\nPAH emission which follows the edges of VLA 2. VLA 2 has a calculated physical size, \u2206s,\nof 3.33 pc and is therefore a classical HII region. It may be that the massive star which\ncreated VLA 2 formed from part of the same cloud of molecular gas as the three existing\nclumps, which do not yet appear to have formed stars. It is also possible that VLA 2 is not\nphysically associated with Clumps 2, 4, and 6 from B06, and that these clumps constitute\na quiescent complex of molecular gas. There is no IRAC emission associated with the HII\nregion VLA 1.\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\n4.2.9. IRAS 18571+0349\nThe 3.6 cm image of the field surrounding IRAS 18571+0349 (Figure 9) shows that there\nare eight sources in the field detected at greater than 5\u00d7\u2206S. All of the sources bar one,\nVLA 3, are extended. VLA 3 and VLA 5 are associated with the most massive millimeter\nclump in this field, Clump 1. In addition, VLA 7 is associated with the millimeter Clump 4.\nMolinari et al. (1998) have previously detected VLA 5 at 6 cm using the VLA in B\narray. HI absorption observations taken by Kuchar & Bania (1994) indicate that the sources\nin this field are at the far distance (d=10.4 kpc). Therefore, we have assumed the far\ndistances calculated from our measured GRS 13 CO velocities in Section 2 for all clumps in\nthe field, and have scaled the clump properties given by B06 accordingly.\nThe IRAC Spitzer image of the region (Figure 9c) shows a ridge of diffuse mid-IR\nemission, with condensations containing bright objects or clusters situated along it. The\nVLA 3.6 cm sources VLA 3, 5 and 7 are associated with GLIMPSE sources in this ridge.\nThe compact source VLA 3 is associated with extended mid-IR emission at approximately\n18h 59m 41s .6 +3\u25e6 53'30\" (J2000), and the peak of VLA 5 is associated with another mid-IR\nsource with the position 18h 59m 43s .0 +3\u25e6 53'37\" (J2000). There is also a bright GLIMPSE\nsource associated with VLA 5, GL037.3418-00.0591 (identified by a blue circle in Figure 9c),\nwhich has IRAC colors [3.6] - [4.5]=2.31 and [5.8] - [8.0]=1.07, showing that this is a highly\nembedded object. The clustering of these sources, along with the associated ionized and\nmolecular gas, suggest that this is a current site of clustered massive star formation.\nFurther to the North, there is also a dust condensation (Clump 4 in B06, associated\nwith VLA 7) in a \"pillar\" which extends from the ridge to the S-E. The ridge contains a\nGLIMPSE source (GL037.3815-00.0820, indicated by a yellow circle in Figure 9c) that has a\nrising SED between 2.17\u03bcm (2MASS K band) and 8.0\u03bcm. Methanol masers have also been\ndetected towards Clump 4 (VLA 7) by Pandian et al. (2007) within a 40\" beam, suggesting\nstar formation is currently occurring within it. It is interesting to note however that the\npeak of VLA 7 is not coincident with the GLIMPSE source, but instead is displaced to the\nEast by 7.5\". It may be that the object associated with GL037.3815-00.0820 is not creating\nan HII region, but instead a nearby star, such as the one directly West of the tip of the pillar,\nis ionizing molecular material in its proximity. The peak of the source VLA 8 is coincident\nwith the GLIMPSE source GL037.3816-00.0922 (shown by a green circle in Figure 9c).\nAlthough unrelated to any diffuse mid-IR emission, VLA 2 and 4 appear to be related to\nthe GLIMPSE sources GL037.3199-00.0641 and GL037.3241-00.0690 respectively (indicated\nby a red and orange circle in Figure 9c).\nIn summary, the field surrounding IRAS 18571+0349 contains several sites of massive\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\nstar formation; in particular, those surrounding Clumps 1 and 4 observed by B06.\n\n4.2.10. IRAS 18586+0106\nThere were no detections above 3\u00d7\u2206S (=0.48 mJy beam\u22121 ) in the IRAS 18586+0106\nfield (Figure 10). Deconvolution of the image was hampered, and therefore the RMS noise\nin the final image was increased, by a bright source (G35.20-1.74) on the edge of the field,\nwhich caused significant stripes through the image. Molinari et al. (1998) detected a faint\nsource in this field at 6 cm, denoted Mol 87, lying between Clumps 1 and 5 (19h 01m 15s .271\n+01\u25e6 11'00.04\", J2000) with a peak flux density of 6.89 mJy beam\u22121 .\nThere are no Spitzer IRAC images which cover this field, however we provide an MSX A\nband image of the field shown in Figure 10. The 8\u03bcm emission is coincident with the IRAS\nsource, however these are both displaced from the peak of the nearest millimeter clump,\nClump 5.\n\n4.3.\n\nDerived Properties of HII Regions\n\nTable 5 lists the derived physical properties of the detected VLA 3.6 cm sources given in\nTable 3. Properties of unresolved and partially resolved sources were derived assuming they\nare spherically symmetric, optically thin, homogeneous, and ionization-bounded HII regions.\nIn the case of irregularly shaped sources, we assume they are optically thin, homogeneous,\nand ionization-bounded HII regions, and that the observed area in the plane of the sky is\nprojected along a depth \u2206s, estimated from the geometrical mean of the size of the source on\nthe sky. We do not take the effect of dust into our calculations, which means our calculated\nspectral types and luminosties are in fact lower limits. We also assume shocks in outflows\ndo not contribute a significant amount to the ionized gas emission.\nIn Table 5, the assumed distance d in kpc for each 3.6 cm source was taken to be the\ndistance of the millimeter source closest in projection on the sky within the observed fields.\nThe effective angular diameter of the source \u2206\u03b8, given in degrees, was found by calculating\nthe geometrical mean of the angular sizes given in Table 3. For unresolved and partially unresolved sources, it was necessary to correct the Gaussian angular diameter \u2206\u03b8 to the angular\nsize of a sphere, using the multiplicative correction factors given in Panagia & Walmsley\n(1978).\nThe physical size \u2206s in pc was calculated from \u2206\u03b8 and d. In the case of unresolved and\npartially unresolved sources, \u2206s was taken to be the physical diameter of the spherical HII\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\nregion. For irregular sources, by assuming that the size of the sources in the plane of the\nsky is similar to that along the line of sight, \u2206s was taken to be the depth of the emitting\nregion.\nThe brightness temperature Tb was found using the Rayleigh-Jeans approximation:\nTb =\n\nS\u03bd 10\u221229 c2\n[K],\n2\u03bd 2 k\u03a9s\n\n(2)\n\nwhere S\u03bd is the integrated flux density of the source in mJy, c is the speed of light in ms\u22121 ,\n\u03bd is the frequency of the radiation in Hz, k is the Boltzmann constant, and \u03a9s is the solid\nangle covered by the source. For unresolved and partially unresolved sources, \u03a9s = \u03c0\u2206\u03b82 /4.\nFor irregular sources, \u03a9s was found by summing the area of all pixels associated with the\nsources with a flux density per beam above \u2206S, the significance level in the image.\nThe optical depth, \u03c4 , was then calculated by solving the equation of radiative transfer\nTb = Te (1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c4 ) for \u03c4 , assuming the emitting region is uniformly filled with Te = 8200 K\nionized gas. The assumed value for the electron temperature was calculated from the results\nof Quireza et al. (2006); the mean electron temperature of their observed sources was Te =\n8200 \u00b1 2330 K. The calculated values for the optical depth given in Table 5 are all less than\n0.1. Therefore, with the exception of the sources G48.587 & G48.661 VLA 2-P, G48.580 &\nG48.616 VLA 4A-P, IRAS 18256-0742 VLA 1-P, and IRAS 18256-0742 VLA 3-P, for which\nthe angular size is an upper limit, and hence their properties should be viewed with caution,\nthe assumption holds that the observed sources are optically thin.\nThe emission measure, EM, is given by:\nEM =\n\n8.235 \u00d7\n\n10\u22122\n\n\u03c4\n[cm\u22126 pc],\n\u22122.1\n\u03b1(\u03bd, Te ) T\u22121.35\n\u03bd\ne\n\n(3)\n\nwhere Te = 8200 K and \u03bd is in GHz. The correction factor \u03b1(\u03bd, Te ), which is of order unity,\nrectifies the small discrepancy between the approximation shown in equation 3, given by\nAltenhoff et al. (1960), and the original derivation by Oster (1961). We take \u03b1(\u03bd, Te ) =\n0.9828 from Table 6 in Mezger & Henderson (1967), for Te = 8000 K and \u03bd = 8 GHz.\nFor sources modeled as a spherical HII region, the number density of electrons, ne , was\nestimated using\n\nne =\n\nr\n\n3 EM\n[cm\u22123 ]\n2\u2206s\n\n(4)\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\nwhere the factor of 2/3 is the ratio of the volume of a sphere to that of a cylinder. For\nirregular sources, the number density is given by:\n\nne =\n\nr\n\nEM\n[cm\u22123 ].\n\u2206s\n\n(5)\n\nFor a spherical HII region, the excitation parameter U can be calculated using the\nequation\n\nU=\n\nrn2/3\ne\n\n\u03bd 0.1 Te0.35 S\u03bd d2\n= 4.553\n\u03b1(\u03bd, Te )\n\u0014\n\n\u00151/3\n\n[pc cm\u22122 ],\n\n(6)\n\nwhich can be derived using equations 3 and 4, and by also assuming that the mean free path\nof photons within the HII region r is equal to \u2206s/2. The frequency \u03bd is in GHz, Te is in\nkelvin, S\u03bd is in Jy, and d is in kpc. An equivalent expression can be derived for the excitation\nparameter U of irregular sources:\n\nU = 3.669 \u00d7 10\n\n\u22122\n\n\u0014\n\n\u03bd 0.1 Te0.35 S\u03bd \u2206s2\n\u03b1(\u03bd, Te )\u03a9s\n\n\u00151/3\n\n[pc cm\u22122 ].\n\n(7)\n\nThe Lyman photon flux required to sustain the HII region, NLy , can be estimated\nvia the equation NLy = V n2e \u03b1B , where V is the volume of the nebula and \u03b1B is the case\nB hydrogen recombination coefficient, which does not include recombinations to the ground\nlevel, as these are balanced by the diffuse radiation field due to recombinations of the ionized\ngas. The recombination coefficient \u03b1B was taken to be 2.59\u00d710\u221213 s\u22121 cm3 (Table 2.1 of\nOsterbrock & Ferland 2006, for T = 104 K).\nTherefore, for both spherical and irregular cases, the ionization rate NLy can be expressed as:\nNLy = 3.020 \u00d7 1045\n\nTe0.35 \u03bd 0.1 d2 S\u03bd \u22121\n[s ].\n\u03b1(\u03bd, Te )\n\n(8)\n\nAssuming the observed HII regions are created by single OB stars, the corresponding\nspectral type and luminosity, Lcm , of the exciting star required to sustain each observed HII\nregion are listed in Table 5. These were found using the results of Panagia (1973).\nTable 5 shows that there is a large range in the properties of the observed HII regions.\nFor instance, their physical sizes extend from <0.05 pc to 7.88 pc, and their spectral types\ncover B2 to O5.\n\n\f\u2013 23 \u2013\n4.3.1. Uncertainties on Derived HII region Properties\nUncertainties on the properties quoted in Table 5 were calculated using a Monte Carlo\nerror propagation code, assuming Gaussian errors for the 3.6 cm integrated flux density, the\n3.6 cm source size, the assumed distance for each 3.6 cm source, and the electron temperature\nTe . The error in the source size was estimated to be 5\" in the case of extended sources, and in\nthe case of unresolved sources the errors given by IMFIT were assumed, which was usually\n. 5%. However the sources G50.271 & G50.283 VLA 4-P; IRAS 18256-0742 VLA 3-P;\nIRAS 18256-0742 VLA 5-P; and IRAS 18424-0329:VLA 1-P have uncertainties in their sizes\nranging from 10 to 40%, and the size of IRAS 18256-0742: VLA 1-P has a 110% uncertainty.\nThe additional uncertainty on the integrated fluxes due to aperture placement (see Section\n4.1) was not included in the error analysis.\nThe approximate uncertainties in the calculated HII region properties are as follows:\nuncertainty in \u2206\u03b8 \u223c 9%, uncertainty in \u2206s \u223c 20%, uncertainty in Tb \u223c 15%, uncertainty\nin \u03c4\u03bd \u223c 45%, uncertainty in EM \u223c 20%, uncertainty in ne and U \u223c 15%, and uncertainty\nin log10 NLy \u223c 15%. Therefore the quoted spectral types are at least correct to within a\nspectral type, which is also the case for the corresponding luminosities.\n\n5.\n5.1.\n\nDiscussion\n\nAssociation of Molecular and Ionized Gas\n\nTable 6 lists the nearest 3.6 cm source in projection to each millimeter clump, noting\nwhether the peak of the associated ionized gas is observed within a radius of 60 arcseconds.\nColumns 4 and 5 of Table 6 list the projected distances, in arcseconds and parsecs respectively, to the peak of the nearest 3.6 cm emission, and the final column provides the stellar\nluminosity required to create the nearest HII region within 60\", taken from the results in\nTable 5.\nFigure 13 shows the distribution of millimeter clumps as a function of their projected\ndistance from the nearest ionized gas in parsecs. Similarly, Figure 14 shows the relationship\nbetween the mass of the millimeter clumps and their projected distance in parsecs from the\nnearest ionized gas. It can be seen from Figure 13 that the observed millimeter clumps tend\nto be associated with the ionized gas. This is not a artifact of our selection criteria, which\nselected millimeter clumps with little or no 21 cm continuum emission toward them in the\nNVSS. In Figure 14, there appears to be no obvious correlation between the mass of a clump\nand the projected distance to the peak of the nearest ionized gas emission.\n\n\f\u2013 24 \u2013\nIt can be seen from Figures 1 to 10 that although the ionized gas tends to be associated\nwith the millimeter clumps, there exist examples of HII regions which, if at the same distance\nas the observed clumps, appear to have formed at the edges of the dense gas. For instance,\nin the field G48.580 & G48.616, the sources VLA 1, 2 and 3 do not appear to be associated\nwith the millimeter emission in the field. This may be evidence that massive stars can also\nform at the edges of their parent molecular clouds. Therefore it would be interesting to carry\nout follow up observations of these sources to determine whether they do lie at the same\nvelocities as the millimeter clumps in each field.\n\n5.2.\n\nInferred Ages of the Observed Sites of Star Formation\n\nSingle early B stars (M\u22c6 \u223c 10 M\u2299 ) reach the Zero Age Main Sequence (ZAMS) in about\n10 years whereas mid-O stars with M\u22c6 & 25M\u2299 reach the ZAMS in \u223c 5 \u00d7 104 years (e.g.,\nYorke 2004, and references therein). In comparison, the time scale for the formation of O\nstar clusters for which the most massive star in the cluster has a mass M\u22c6 > 25M\u2299 (roughly\na mid-O star) appears to be <3 Myrs (Massey et al. 1995). Early B stars in these clusters\ncontinue to form at least 1 Myrs after the formation of the O stars.\n5\n\nSeveral fields show examples in which HII regions are interspersed throughout the gas\nand dust traced by 1 mm emission: the HII region G48.598 & G48.656 VLA 5 (Figure 3) is\nproduced by a cluster of early B to late O stars, and G48.580 & G48.616 VLA 5 (Figure\n2) by a late O star cluster. The presence of such a well-defined cluster suggests that these\nregions are likely to be more evolved (since multiple ZAMS stars have formed already) and,\nindeed, the HII regions tend to be extended and/or complex. Yet there is the potential for\nsignificantly more star formation to occur, as there are still large amounts of gas (\u223c1000-5000\nM\u2299 ) traced by warm dust emission that are able to continue to form massive stars in the\ncluster. Given the presence of ongoing massive star formation in these two clusters, their\nage is likely to be greater than \u223c 106 years but less than 3 Myrs.\nSeveral regions also have massive millimeter clumps that show only a singly peaked HII\nregion forming at or near the center of a millimeter clump. Examples include G44.587 &\nG44.661 VLA1 (Figure 1), that has the required luminosity of a early B star, and G50.271\n& G50.283 VLA1 (Figure 6) with the luminosity of a late O star. The presence of a single\nHII region suggests that these sites have just started the massive star formation process and\nonly a single star or a compact star cluster producing the HII region has reached the ZAMS\nso far. These regions are likely to be roughly 5 \u00d7 104 to 105 years old.\nA number of regions have millimeter clumps that show no ionized gas emission near the\n\n\f\u2013 25 \u2013\nwarm dust peak. Examples include the clump G48.616 with a mass of 484 M\u2299 ; G48.540\nwith a mass of 333 M\u2299 (both Figure 2), and G50.271 with a mass of 157 M\u2299 (Figure 6).\nThus, these sources are candidate sites for the earliest stages of star formation in which any\nmassive forming star has not yet reached the ZAMS. If this is the case, they are likely to be\nless than \u223c 5 \u00d7 104 years old. Alternatively, these millimeter sources could represent sites of\nmore evolved low mass star formation. The sources G44.587 and G44.661 are good examples\nof this, where the GLIMPSE image of this field (Figure 1c) shows that there are clusters\nassociated with these two millimeter clumps.\n\n5.3.\n\nComparison of 1 mm and\n\n13\n\nCO Images\n\nFigure 15 presents a comparison of the millimeter continuum emission (from BGPS\nor B06) tracing warm dust, the 13 CO emission from the GRS survey (Jackson et al. 2006)\ntracing gas at comparatively lower densities and temperatures than the 1 mm images, and\nthe locations of the detected ionized gas peaks, for several of the observed fields. Only\nthose sources with GRS data (8 of the 10 observed fields) are presented. Integrated 13 CO\nemission is shown in greyscale, warm dust emission in contours, and cross symbols mark the\npeak positions of the HII regions listed in Table 3. The integrated 13 CO images were made\nby integrating the channels containing 13 CO emission from the clouds associated with each\nmillimeter clump. In many cases, the same cloud contained several of the clumps in the\nfield. From Figure 15, we can see that in all cases, the warm, 1 mm dust emission follows\nthe morphology of the 13 CO gas emission. This demonstrates how it was possible to match\nthe morphologies of the millimeter and 13 CO emission, and therefore assign velocities and\ndistances to our observed sources with confidence.\nMasses of the material associated with the observed millimeter clumps were also derived\nfrom the 13 CO and \u223c1 mm emission over the area of sky covering the 13 CO cloud, using\nthe same photometry aperture for both images. The 13 CO masses were derived using the\nequations of Scoville et al. (1986), assuming the emitting material is optically thin. We also\nassumed a temperature of 10K, in agreement with the results of Rathborne et al. (2009),\nand found the required [12 CO/13 CO] abundance ratios from the results of Wilson & Rood\n(1994). The millimeter dust masses were calculated using the same method as outlined in\nSection 2.1. For dust masses calculated from the B06 1.2 mm images, the dust opacity was\nassumed to be 1 cm2 g\u22121 , consistent with their assumed value.\nTable 7 presents the calculated masses of the associated cloud material in 13 CO and\n1 mm dust emission, Mcloud (13 CO) and Mcloud (1 mm) respectively, along with the ratios\nMcloud (1 mm)/Mcloud (13 CO) and \u03a3Mclump (1 mm)/Mcloud (13 CO). The value \u03a3Mclump (1 mm)/Mcloud (13 CO)\n\n\f\u2013 26 \u2013\nis the sum of the masses of the associated millimeter clumps selected from BGPS or B06\nover the total cloud mass traced by 13 CO. The cloud masses given are highly uncertain,\ndue to the arbitrary apertures used, and therefore the ratio \u03a3Mclump (1 mm)/Mcloud (13 CO)\nis correspondingly uncertain. However, as the cloud masses have been calculated from the\nfluxes measured in the same photometry apertures, their ratio, Mcloud (1 mm)/Mcloud (13 CO),\ndoes not suffer from this uncertainty.\nThe ratio Mcloud (1 mm)/Mcloud (13 CO) ranges from 0.08 to 1.0 with a mean and median\nvalue of 0.33\u00b10.25 and 0.26 respectively. This ratio gives an estimate of the fraction of\nmass warm, more compact, dust structures traced by 1 mm emission take up in the cloud\ncompared to the cooler, lower density material traced by 13 CO.\nThe ratio \u03a3Mclump (1 mm)/Mcloud (13 CO) gives an estimate of the amount of mass the\nmost compact structures, traced by the detected clumps in the 1 mm images, contribute to\nthe mass of the cloud. The values for this ratio range from 0.04 to 0.43 with a mean and\nmedian of 0.13\u00b10.12 and 0.07 respectively.\n\n5.4.\n\nComparison of the Mass of Embedded Stars to Clump Masses\n\nTable 8 compares the mass of each millimeter clump, Mclump , with the combined mass of\nits embedded ionizing stars, M\u22c6 , derived from the luminosities given in Table 5. Only sources\nwhere the millimeter and centimeter emission are coincident, suggesting that the massive star\nproducing the ionized gas is associated with the millimeter clump, are included in Table 8.\nThe stellar masses were calculated using the relation Lcm \u221d M\u22c63.6 . The final column of Table\n8 gives the ratio M\u22c6 /(Mclump +M\u22c6 ). This quantity represents the instantaneous massive star\nformation efficiency (MSFE) in the dense gas traced by warm dust emission. The MSFEs in\nthese millimeter clumps range from a few percent to 25%, while the mean MSFE is 7 \u00b1 8%.\nFigure 16 shows the relationship between Mclump and M\u22c6 . We fit a polynomial function to\nthe results of Panagia (1973), to find a function describing the relationship between log10 NLy\nand log10 Lcm . Assuming Lcm \u221d M\u22c63.6 , we then found the relationship between log10 NLy and\nlog10 M\u22c6 , from which we could calculate values of log10 M\u22c6 and derive uncertainties. Due to\nthe different calculation method, the values of M\u22c6 plotted in Figure 16 differ slightly from\nthose given in Table 8.\nError bars are also shown in Figure 16. The error in the clump mass Mclump is approximately a factor of two (see Section 2.1). The main source of error in the combined stellar\nmass M\u22c6 originates from the uncertainties in the distance to the HII region and the electron\ntemperature Te , which are the largest errors involved in the calculation of NLy . However, it\n\n\f\u2013 27 \u2013\nis possible that our assumptions, such as that each HII region is powered by a single star,\nare incorrect, which may explain the large scatter in the data around the trend line.\nFigure 16 shows a possible power law relationship between Mclump and M\u22c6 . Without\ntaking in to account the errors on Mclump and M\u22c6 , these data can be fit by the following\npower law: M\u22c6 = 1.0 \u00b1 0.9 \u00d7 Mclump 0.5\u00b10.1 , which is drawn upon the data in Figure 16. The\ncorrelation coefficient between log10 Mclump and log10 M\u22c6 was found to be 0.74. This result\nis consistent with the the idea that the mass of the clump should determine the mass of the\nmassive stars forming within it. It also bears resemblance to the prediction of competitive\naccretion simulations that the most massive star in a forming cluster is related to the mass of\nthe remaining stars in the cluster (Bonnell et al. 2004). These simulations predict a power\n2/3\nlaw relationship of the form Mmax \u221d Mstars , similar to the power law we observe. We\nwould expect these two relationships to resemble one another if the mass of a clump is\nlinearly related to the total mass of all the stars that form from it. As we are only able\nto show a small number of data points in Figure 16, it would be useful for future studies\nto confirm whether the same result is found for a larger number of clumps with embedded\nmassive stars.\n\n5.5.\n\nFollow-up of the Observed Fields with the EVLA and ALMA\n\nBy comparing 3.6 cm, \u223c1 mm, 13 CO, and mid-IR observations, we have been able to\ngain insight into several regions of massive star formation. However future studies with\nthe EVLA and ALMA will be able to further enhance our understanding. The EVLA will\nhave 5-20 times the continuum sensitivity of the current VLA, allowing the detection of\nfainter centimeter continuum emission from ionized gas. In addition, just over a third of\nour detected 3.6 cm sources are unresolved: 17 of the 47 detected sources (including subcomponents). Therefore follow-up EVLA continuum observations in A, B, or C array of these\nfields will allow us to further resolve the ionized gas towards these star formation regions.\nALMA is set to revolutionize our understanding of star formation. This is primarily\nbecause it will provide spatial resolutions on the order of 0.01\" at 1 mm, which is a vast\nimprovement in resolution over the \u223c1 mm observations presented in this paper (33\" and\n44\"). Even at distances of 10 kpc this will still provide a physical resolution of 100 AU, which\nwill be sufficient to map any outflows and disks around the youngest massive stars. Examples\nof some of the transitions which will be observable at these wavelengths are 13 CO(J=21), 13 CO(J=3-2), HCN(J=3-2), CS(J=7-6), and CH3 CN(J=12-11), all suitable for tracing\noutflows or disks around forming stars.\n\n\f\u2013 28 \u2013\nOne example of where EVLA and ALMA observations would improve our understanding of our observed 3.6 cm and 1.1 mm sources is the millimeter clump G48.605, which is\ncoincident with the 3.6 cm HII region VLA 5D. High sensitivity A array 3.6 cm observations\nof this region may further resolve the two centimeter continuum sources G48.606+0.023 and\nG48.606+0.024 towards VLA 5D detected by Kurtz et al. (1994), and also be able to pick\nup fainter compact emission towards them. In addition, ALMA observations would be able\nto determine whether there is an outflow toward VLA 5D which could produce shocked H2\nemission at 4.5\u03bcm, and also be able to study the molecular lines in this region to detect any\ndisk or torus-like structures.\n\n6.\n\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nUsing 3.6 cm continuum observations with the VLA, we have surveyed the ionized gas towards 31 intermediate and massive molecular clumps previously observed at millimeter wavelengths. These millimeter clumps were selected from preliminary 1.1 mm Bolocam Galactic\nPlane Survey images, and the 1.2 mm observations of Beltr\u00e1n et al. (2006).\nIn the 10 observed fields, 35 HII regions were identified, 20 of them being newly discovered. The observed HII regions display a wide range of morphologies, and many are multiply\npeaked, indicating the presence of a cluster of massive stars.\nImages comparing the warm dust and ionized gas emission in the 10 observed fields are\npresented, as well as GLIMPSE survey images of Spizter IRAC emission in these fields. The\nproperties of the millimeter continuum clumps and the HII regions were calculated, and are\nlisted in Tables 1 and 5. There is a large range in the properties of the observed HII regions;\ntheir physical sizes extend from <0.05 pc to 7.88 pc, and their spectral types cover B2 to O5.\nThe wealth of information we have provided about the observed millimeter clumps allows\nthem to be followed up in future with more powerful instruments such as the EVLA and\nALMA.\nBy comparing the positions of the millimeter clumps and ionized gas, we have shown that\nthe ionized gas tends to be associated with the millimeter clumps, however this association\ndoes not depend on the mass of the clump. Of the 31 millimeter clumps observed, 9 appear\nto be physically related to ionized gas, and a further 6 have ionized gas emission within 1'.\nWe also infer ages for several \"types\" of millimeter clump: those with multiply peaked\n3.6 cm continuum emission, indicating they are clusters, are most likely to pinpoint the most\nevolved sites of star formation. These are followed by millimeter clumps associated with\nsingly peaked HII regions, which are likely to be a single star or compact cluster, and finally\n\n\f\u2013 29 \u2013\nmillimeter clumps with no associated ionized gas emission may provide examples of the\nyoungest sources.\nComparing the 1 mm Bolocam or SEST images with 13 CO images from the Galactic\nRing Survey (GPS), we have shown that the emission from these two tracers is correlated,\nconfirming that distance determinations using 13 CO data can be made for the observed 1 mm\nclumps.\nWe have compared the masses of massive stars or star clusters to the actual amount of\ngas available traced by millimeter emission to provide an estimate of the instantaneous star\nformation efficiency for a clump, giving values ranging from a few percent to 25%, with an\naverage of 7 \u00b1 8%.\nWe find that the mass of a clump is correlated with the mass of the massive stars which\nform within it, and that this relationship is consistent with a power law. This is comparable\nto the results of Bonnell et al. (2004), who find that there is a power-law relationship between\nthe most massive star in a cluster and the combined mass of the remaining stars.\nWe would like to thank the anonymous referee for providing helpful comments which\nallowed us to improve this paper.

These\nsources were originally thought to be at a different velocity, placing them at dnear \u223c1 kpc.\n\n\f\u2013 59 \u2013\n\nTable 2.
