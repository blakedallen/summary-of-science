INTRODUCTION\n\nGamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are thought to be energetic\nevents heralding the formation of black holes (BHs): the explosion of a massive star at cosmological distances gives rise\nto a long GRB, or two neutron stars coalesce to make a short\nGRB. (For a recent review of GRBs, see Gehrels, RamirezRuiz, & Fox 2009.) To see a GRB at all, our line-of-sight\nmust lie close to the BH angular momentum vector. A jet\nis launched toward the observer as the BH forms. The initial Lorentz factor of material in the jet \u223c 102 \u2212 103 is large\nenough so that the observer only sees the central portion of the\njet, due to relativistic beaming. The transition from \"spherical\" to \"jet-like\" expansion of the GRB ejecta is the basis\nof the current framework within which the analysis of GRB\nlight curves is carried out (Rhoads 1997, 1999; Sari, Piran, &\nHalpern 1999). Parts of the jet further away from the symmetry axis are initially invisible to the observer, hence the expansion is indistinguishable from that of of a relativistically\nexpanding sphere. Eventually interaction with the circumstellar medium reduces the Lorentz factor until the edges of the\njet are visible, after which the decay of the GRB afterglow\nlight curves becomes more rapid. This fundamental property\nof the decay relies only on special relativity and is not specific to any one wavelength so these theoretical decays should\nhave a similar, strong \"break\" from shallow to steep across all\nwavebands, hence the designation \"achromatic break\".\nFrail et al. (2001) studied the decay properties of 17 preSwift GRBs with redshifts. By analyzing the multiwavelength\ndecay properties, they were able to determine putative break\ntimes, which, when combined with distances and isotropicequivalent GRB energies, allowed a correction to the true,\nbeaming-corrected energy. Frail et al. (2001, see their Fig. 2)\nshow how a spread in isotropic energies between \u223c 1052 and\n1 CRESST/Joint Center for Astrophysics, University of Maryland, Baltimore County, Baltimore, MD 21250, John.K.Cannizzo@nasa.gov\n2 NASA-Goddard Space Flight Center,\nGreenbelt, MD 20771,\ngehrels@milkyway.gsfc.nasa.gov\n1 submitted to the Astrophysical Journal: 22 Jan 2009; accepted: 23 May\n2009\n\n\u223c 1054 erg for their sample is considerably reduced down to\na standard, geometry-corrected energy centered at \u223c 3 \u00d7 1050\nerg. A detailed examination of the data entering into their\nstudy (see their Table 1) shows the sparse coverage of many\nof the light curves and underscores the difficulty in reliably assigning break times3 . An updated study along the same lines\nas Frail et al. (2001) by Bloom, Frail, & Kulkarni (2003) contains a somewhat larger sample \u2212 28 GRBs with redshifts.\nWe should emphasize that we do not argue against the need\nfor beaming; clearly energies as large as \u223c 1054 erg are problematic, given that M\u2299 c2 = 1.8 \u00d7 1054 erg. It is important\nto distinguish, however, between a time-variable relativistic\nbeaming, and geometric beaming. In this work we adopt a\ntime-constant geometric beaming factor fbeam = 3 \u00d7 10\u22123 to\nconvert from isotropic energy to true energy. The question of\ninterest to us is whether the very long term decay in the flux\nfrom GRBs, particular the X-ray flux, is due to the deceleration of a jet, or a decreasing mass supply rate onto the central\nengine.\nIt was anticipated that Swift (Gehrels et al. 2004) would\nprovide good examples of shallow-to-steep achromatic decays. After >\n\u223c 400 Swift GRBs, and now a total of > 170\nredshifts for all GRBs (41 for pre-Swift GRBs), this has\nnot turned out to be the case. In spite of many GRBs\nwith exquisite wavelength coverage, observed over many\ne\u2212foldings of decay in flux, there is only one GRB in the\nSwift era perhaps showing an achromatic break, seen in X-ray\nand optical (GRB060206 - Curran et al. 2007) and a small\nnumber with candidate jet-breaks (Blustin et al. 2006, Stanek\net al. 2007, Dai et al. 2007, Willingale et al. 2007, Kocevski\n& Butler 2008); the overwhelming majority do not show one\n(e.g., Oates et al. 2007; Racusin et al. 2008; Liang et al.\n2008). Liang et al. (2008) present a thorough investigation of\nSwift XRT and optical jet break candidates. They note that \"It\nis fair to conclude that we still have not found a textbook version of a jet break after many years of intense observational\ncampaigns.\"\n3 The data used by Frail et al., as well as that for all GRBs, is viewable at\nhttp://grblog.org/grblog.php\n\n\f2\n\nCANNIZZO & GEHRELS\n\nF IG . 1.- A schematic representation of the X-ray decay of a Swift GRB\nas seen with XRT, based on the Zhang et al. (2006) idealization and GRB\n060729 from Willingale et al. (2007, see their Fig. 10). To account for cosmological time dilation for a given GRB, the x\u2212axis needs to be shortened\nby a factor 1 + z.\n\nZhang et al. (2006, see their Fig. 1; also Nousek et al.\n2006, see their Fig. 3) present a simple schematic for the decaying GRB light curve as seen by the XRT on Swift. The\ndecay is traditionally shown in log F \u2212 log t. There are four\nbasic power-law decay (F \u221d t\u2212\u03b1 ) regimes: (I) \u03b1I \u2243 3 out\nto 102 \u2212 103 s, (II) \u03b1II \u2243 0.5 out to 103 \u2212 104 s, (III)\n\u03b1III \u2243 1.2 out to 104 \u2212 105 s, and (IV) \u03b1IV \u2243 2 at late\ntimes. The general picture given in Zhang et al. based on\na handful of case studies from early Swift XRT results has\nbeen borne out by studies relying on a much larger sample\n(e.g., O'Brien et al. 2006, Ghisellini et al. 2009). In addition\none also frequently sees flares within segment II (Burrows, et\nal. 2005; for possible explanations see Perna, Armitage, &\nZhang 2006, Lazzati, Perna, & Begelman 2008), which are\nbeyond the scope of this work. Figure 1 shows a schematic\nreproduction of the idealized Zhang et al. light curve, with\nrealistic numbers for the XRT flux. The conversion from the\nXRT flux values to a beaming-corrected luminosity is given\nby LXRT = 4\u03c0d2L fbeamFXRT , where dL is the luminosity\ndistance.\nIn this work we present a framework based on the long term\nevolution of a transient accretion disk formed out of some\nsmall fraction of the progenitor to account for segments II,\nIII, and IV. (Segment I is too steep to be accounted for in our\nformalism.) The flatness of segment II arises from the transient adjustment of a small amount of gas into an accretion\ndisk, the segment III decay is consistent with the self-similar\ndecay of a disk without a confining external torque, and the\nincrease in slope in segment IV would be caused by the onset\nof significant disk evaporation (or by the late-time accretion\nfrom a super-Eddington slim disk). The consistency of the\ntheoretical decay with segment III argues for a direct association, and the fact that it takes some time for an arbitrary initial\nmass profile to adjust into a disk leads to the transient interval\n(segment II).\nThis work applies mainly to the commonly observed \"long\"\nGRBs which are believed to be due to the core collapse of a\nmassive, high angular momentum progenitor, leading to the\n\nformation of black hole \u2212 the \"collapsar\" model (Woosley\n1993; MacFadyen & Woosley 1999; Woosley & Bloom 2006;\nNagataki et al. 2007). There follows a period of electromagnetic extraction of energy from the BH which powers a collimated jet. For \u223c 102 \u2212 103 s following the phase of prompt\nGRB emission, \u223c 0.1M\u2299 of bound matter from the disrupted\nprogenitor star returns to the BH vicinity due to conservation\nof angular momentum. Kumar, Narayan, & Johnson (2008ab)\nattempt to explain the long-term Swift X-ray light curves in\nterms of various phases of an accretion model. They argue\nthat the rapid accretion of the outer half of the core of the progenitor, possessing a density profile that drops steeply with radius, can lead to the initial, rapid decay. For the flat segment\n(II) they discuss briefly the idea of having a small accretion\ndisk viscosity, but ultimately discard this explanation in favor\nof prolonged fall-back of gas from the envelope of the progenitor at larger radii, which they argue can supply matter to the\ncentral engine at a near-constant rate, or a rate that decreases\nslightly with time. Kumar et al. (2008a) also present analytic\ntime dependent solutions for an accretion disk in an ADAFlike state (ADAF = advection dominated accretion flow) and\nshow that, for a radial mass profile \u1e40 (r) \u221d rs , the decay\nlaw would be \u03b1III = 4(s + 1)/3. For s = 0, i.e., no wind\nmass-loss from the disk, the decay is close to the Zhang et\nal. (2006) value. Under the assumptions of core fall-back for\nsegment I and envelope fall-back for segment II, Kumar et al.\n(2008b) place constraints on the progenitor core and envelope\nradii, their density profiles, and the pre-SN rotation rates of\nthe core and envelope, normalized to their Keplerian values.\nIn Section 2 we discuss the physics of accretion disks, both\nsteady state and time dependent. Section 3 presents a scenario\nfor the overall, long term evolution of the external accretion\ndisk, section 4 presents a discussion, section 5 discusses the\nimplications of the theory, and section 6 sums up.\n2. ACCRETION DISK PHYSICS\n\nMost of the previous discussion of GRB fall-back disks has\nfailed to recognize one unavoidable aspect of their existence:\nnamely, their outer edge moves outward with time, carrying\nwith it mass and angular momentum. (Notable exceptions are\nKumar et al. [2008ab].) One can make simple arguments\nabout the perturbation accretion time scale near the central\nengine based on physical conditions there, but the outer portions are causally linked to the inner regions through angular\nmomentum transport, and it is these outlying regions that set\nthe long-term accretion disk time scales.\nThe physical agent responsible for angular momentum\ntransport and turbulent dissipation of energy is now believed\nto be the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) or BalbusHawley instability (Balbus & Hawley 1998) which involves\nthe shearing amplification of a weak seed magnetic field. The\ngeneral process of angular momentum transport and energy\ndissipation in accretion disks is still commonly referred to as\n\"viscosity\". Balbus & Papaloizou (1999) show a foundation\nfor the dynamical \"\u03b1\" view of accretion disks (Shakura &\nSunyaev 1973) within the MRI.\nExtensive study of accretion disks in interacting binaries\nhas guided thought on accretion disks in other types of systems, such as around BHs in AGNs. For instance, the best\nconstraint we have of the magnitude of the \u03b1 parameter comes\nfrom a detailed study of the rate of decay of dwarf nova outbursts (Smak 1984), and the values obtained for ionized gas\n\u03b1 \u2243 0.1 \u2212 0.2 have been carried over to accretion disks in\nother systems.\n\n\f3\nOne aspect of accretion disks which is quite different for\nisolated BHs is the lack of a constraint on the outer radius.\nThe sudden introduction of an annulus of gas near a central\nmass leads to a process of smearing of the matter into a broadened ring. The ring spreads both to smaller and larger radii in\nresponse to outward transport of angular momentum. As mass\ndrains from the inner edge, an ever smaller amount of material moves to larger and larger radii. Pringle (1974) studied\n\"external accretion disks\" in which matter initially in a torus\nspreads both to smaller and larger radii. The class of solutions he considered of relevance to this work is that for disks\nwith constant total angular momentum and decreasing mass.\nPringle (1991) generalized his earlier results.\nBy writing the equations for mass continuity and angular\nmomentum transport in cylindrical coordinates, assuming Keplerian rotation \u03a92K = GMBH r\u22123 and a thin accretion disk,\nand integrating over the vertical thickness of the accretion\ndisk, one arrives at an equation for the evolution of the surface density \u03a3 = 2\u03c1h, where \u03c1 is the density and h the disk\nsemithickness (actually pressure scale height),\n\u0014\n\u0011\u0015\n\u2202 \u0010\n3 \u2202\n\u2202\u03a3\n(1)\nr1/2\n\u03bd\u03a3r1/2 .\n=\n\u2202t\nr \u2202r\n\u2202r\n\nThe kinematic viscosity coefficient\n\u03bd=\n\n2\u03b1P\n,\n3\u03a9K \u03c1\n\n(2)\n\nwhere P is the pressure and \u03b1 is the Shakura-Sunyaev\nparametrization of the angular momentum transport and heating (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973). Debate persisted over many\nyears as whether the viscosity should scale with the total pressure or gas pressure. A scaling with the total pressure leads\nto a strong dynamical instability in regions where Prad >\nPgas \u2212 the Lightman-Eardley instability (Lightman & Eardley 1974) \u2212 which manifests itself as a limit cycle operating in the inner, radiation pressure dominated portions of the\ndisk (e.g., Cannizzo 1997). However, the fact that X-ray binaries with very high rates of accretion, such as Sco X-1, often\nhave perfectly stable light curves leads one to conclude that\nthe Lightman-Eardley instability is probably the artifact of an\nincorrect assumption for thin disks, namely \u03bd \u221d Ptotal (Done,\nGierli\u0144ski, & Kubota 2007). With the advent of the MRI, detailed MHD calculations show that the saturation limit of the\ninstability depends on the magnetic energy density reaching\na limit that may depend on surface density rather than pressure (e.g., Hirose, Krolik, & Blaes 2009). Hirose et al. find\nnot only that radiation dominated disks are thermally stable,\nbut that fluctuations in magnetic field strength causally precede those in pressure (both radiation and gas). Hirose et al.\nsuggest adopting \u03a3 as the relevant independent variable.\nThe MRI couples linearly to the Keplerian shear in the disk\nand dissipates energy through turbulent transport. In formulating the steady state equations for the radial profile of accretion disk structure, one begins by equating a heating function\nQ+\nvis =\n\n9\n\u03bd\u03a3\u03a92K\n8\n\n(3)\n\n4 ac T 4\n,\n3 \u03ba\u03c1 h\n\n(4)\n\nwith a cooling function\nQ\u2212\nrad =\n\nassuming an optically thick vertical structure with energy\ntransported by radiative diffusion.

Blandford-Znajek Coupling to the Inner Disk\n\nAfter a period of equilibration and expansion, the external disk may span many decades in radius \u2212 from \u223c 107\nto \u223c 1011 cm. The physical state of the disk is expected to\nvary enormously as one progresses from small to large radii.\nIn terms of mediating the flow of mass down onto the central engine, the similarity solutions just discussed rely on the\nphysical state of the outer disk. The physical state of the inner disk determines the strength of the Blandford-Znajek (BZ)\nprocess (Blandford & Znajek 1977) that extracts rotational\nenergy from the central BH. Ghosh & Abramowicz (1997)\nexamined the dependence of the strength of the BZ mechanism on physical conditions in the inner disk. The energy\ndensity of the magnetic field entrained within the disk sets\nthe BZ luminosity, and insofar as the saturation limit is set by\nequipartition with the pressure, the maximum pressure pmax\nis of relevance.\nLivio, Ogilvie, & Pringle (1999) investigated the role of\nthe BZ mechanism in powering outflows and found that if the\nmagnetic field threading the inner disk does not differ significantly in strength from that threading the black hole, the electromagnetic output from the inner disk regions should dominate over that from the hole. In simple terms, the disk is\nmore efficient at holding and accelerating the magnetic field\nbecause its magnetic diffusivity is much less than that of the\nBH.\nHowever, more recent works using sophisticated GRMHD\ncodes to follow the detailed magnetohydrodynamic launching of flows from the very inner disk find them to be highly\nefficient in terms of tapping the available supply of rest massenergy in the disk. (McKinney & Narayan 2007ab; Krolik,\nHawley, & Hirose 2007). McKinney & Narayan (2007a) note\nthat previous simple estimates of the BH and disk failed to\ntake into account the conversion of EM power into thermal\nand material power in the corona and disk wind (Ghosh &\nAbramowicz 1997, Livio, Ogilvie, & Pringle 1999) and so\nmay have seriously overestimated the power from the disk,\nin which case the BH power may dominate. Krolik, Hawley, & Hirose (2007, see their Table 1) find high efficiencies\n\u01ebbeam for the jet power, measured either in terms of mass,\nradiative energy, or EM energy, normalized to the rest massenergy accretion in the disk \u1e40 c2 . Their radiative efficiency\nvalues (which they denote \u03b7NT ) increase with a/M , ranging\nfrom 0.057 for a/M = 0 up to 0.264 for a/M = 0.99. The\nefficiencies may increase with time due to BH spin-up. These\nworkers find the jet to be Poynting flux dominated near the\nBH spin axis, giving strength to the idea of a lightweight jet\nthat responds quickly to changes in \u1e40 in the inner disk. In\nthis work we adopt \u01ebbeam = 0.1 as a fiducial value relating\nthe jet energy production as seen in X-rays to the accretion\nrest mass-energy within the main body of the accretion disk.\nInitially the accretion rate can approach \u223c 1M\u2299 s\u22121 ,\ni.e., super-Eddington by a factor \u223c 1014 . One might question whether an accretion disk description is fully applicable.\n\n\f4\n\nCANNIZZO & GEHRELS\n\nStudies of the inner disk at these very early times find that the\ntemperatures and densities are so large that the cooling is by\nneutrino emission (Narayan, Piran, & Kumar 2001, Kohri &\nMineshige 2002, Kohri, Narayan, & Piran 2005, Chen & Beloborodov 2007). Chen & Beloborodov (2007) show that for\na BH with high spin a \u223c 1 a neutrino cooling dominated disk\ntransitions to an advective disk at \u223c 10\u22123 \u2212 10\u22122 M\u2299 s\u22121 .\nKohri & Mineshige (2002, see their Fig. 1) detail the different physical regimes of these disks. The cooling function\n\u2212\n\u2212\nQ\u2212 = Q\u2212\nrad + Qadv + Q\u03bd ,\n\nwhere\n\nQ\u2212\n\u03bd\n\n(7)\n\n\u22123/5\n\n\u03a3 = 2.84 \u00d7 107 g cm\u22122 r11\n\n3/10\n\n\u22129/10\n\n2.2. Eddington Luminosity and Accretion Rate\n\nFor the GRB depicted schematically in Fig. 1, z = 0.54\nand dL = 3.1 Gpc. The inferred, beaming-corrected Xray luminosity corresponding to the earliest time we seek to\naddress, namely the onset of segment II, would be LII =\n4\u03c0d2L fbeamFXRT, II \u2243 3 \u00d7 1043 erg s\u22121 , where we used\nFXRT, II = 10\u221211 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 (Grupe et al. 2007; see\ntheir Fig. 4) and fbeam = 3 \u00d7 10\u22123 . The isotropic-equivalent\nX-ray plateau luminosity for this GRB, \u223c 1046 erg s\u22121 , is\nin about the middle (logarithmically) of the range 1044 erg\n2\n\u22121\n< 48\ns\u22121 <\n\u223c 4\u03c0dL FXRT, II \u223c 10 erg s shown in Dainotti et al.\n(2008; see their Figs. 1 and 2). Adopting \u01ebbeam = 0.1, the\ngeometry-corrected luminosity translates into a rate of accretion in the inner disk LII /(\u01ebbeamc2 ) \u2243 5.3 \u00d7 10\u22123 M\u2299 yr\u22121 .\nIn the conventional view, for rates of accretion larger than the\nEddington rate\n4\u03c0GMBH c\n\u2243 1.25 \u00d7 1039 (MBH /10M\u2299 ) erg s\u22121\n\u03baes\n(8)\nradiation pressure impedes the accretion process (see below,\nhowever, for the possibility of a slim disk). The Eddington accretion rate depends on radius, through the local efficiency with which gravitational energy is radiated \u01ebacc (r) \u2261\nGMBH /(rc2 ). The locally defined Eddington accretion rate\n\u1e40E (r) is related to the Eddington luminosity via\nLE =\n\n(9)\n\nThus \u01ebacc (r) \u221d r\u22121 and \u1e40E (r) \u221d r, varying from\n1.3 \u00d7 10\u22127 M\u2299 yr\u22121 in the inner disk 6GMBH /c2 to 1.5 \u00d7\n10\u22123 M\u2299 yr\u22121 at 1011 cm. Therefore in the region of interest\nto us in this study, namely the outermost part of the disk, the\nrate would only be locally super-Eddington by a factor \u223c 3 at\nthis early time.\nThe preceding discussion was based on the standard assumption of solar composition material, which is almost certainly not the case here. The fall-back matter comprising the\ndisk would be expected to be dominated by r\u2212processed material - Ni, Si, and Fe group elements. Calculations of the\nEddington limit for such material indicate a potential suppression of the standard Eddington value by up to about three orders of magnitude due to increased opacity from lines (e.g.,\nFryer, Colgate, & Pinto 1999). However, this applies mainly\nto much lower temperatures than those discussed in the next\nsection.\n2.3. Steady State Physics\n2.3.1.

Note that because we adopt \u03bd \u221d Pgas , the fact that\nPrad > Pgas is not problematic in itself as long as h/r << 1.\nHowever, the fact that h/r \u2243 0.5 begins to be problematic.\nAs a last consistency check, the ratio of the flux of radially\nadvected energy (\u1e40 /2\u03c0r2 )c2s to vertically transported energy\nQ\u2212\n3 \u03baes R \u1e40 \u03a3\nadv\n\u2212 =\n16\u03c0 ac\u03bc r2 T 3\nQrad\n1/10\n\n= 1.02 \u00d7 10\u22123 r11\n\n\u22127/10\n\n\u22121/5\n\nmBH, 1 \u03b1\u22121\n\n(17)\n2/5\n\n\u1e41\u22122 .\n\n(18)\n\nIn summary, the standard model is marginally self-consistent\nfor representative values in the outer disk r11 \u2243 \u1e41\u22122 \u2243 1.\nNote that for mBH, 1 = r11 = 1, we have \u01ebacc (r) \u2243\n1.5 \u00d7 10\u22125 and \u1e40E (r) \u2243 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22123 M\u2299 yr\u22121 . A value\n\u1e41\u22122 \u2243 0.5 (determined from LII ) at r11 = 1 would be\nlocally super-Eddington only by a factor \u223c 3, but by larger\nfactors at smaller radii since \u1e40E (r) \u221d r. As noted earlier, the true super-Eddington factors could be greater for the\nr\u2212processed gas, although for T \u2243 107 K the opacity is basically electron scattering, which is actually suppressed due to\nthe fact that the hydrogen fraction X = 0, and \u03baes \u221d (1 + X).\nAt smaller radii the standard model would become quite problematic due to Prad /Pgas >> 1 leading to h/r >\n\u223c 1, and\n\u1e40 /\u1e40E (r) >> 1. Although a detailed description of the disk\nat smaller radii is not of primary relevance to this work, we\nbriefly look at two formalisms of potential interest.\n\n\f5\n2.3.2. Super-Eddington Slim Disk\n\nFor disks with accretion rates of order Eddington, the sizable radial gradients demand the introduction of a radial advective energy transport term (Abramowicz et al. 1988, Chen\net al. 1995; Kato, Fukue, & Mineshige 1998). The cooling\nfunction is now written\n\u2212\nQ\u2212 = Q\u2212\nrad + Qadv ,\n\n(19)\n\n(Shakura & Sunyaev 1973), the maintenance of a disk bordering on being Eddington at all radii would enforce h/r = 1.\nThe disk would be non-steady state,\n\u1e40 (r) =\n\n\u03a3=\n\nds\n,\n(20)\ndr\nand s is the entropy per particle.

The anticipated accretion rate \u223c\n3\u1e40E (r) at r11 = 1 places the accretion disk model on the\nupper stable branch of slim disk solutions (Abramowicz et al.\n1988, see their Fig. 4) where radiation pressure dominates\n(Kato, Fukue, & Mineshige 1998, see their section 10.1.1).\nSolving the disk parameters for P = Prad gives\n\nc\n16\n3\u03b1\u03a9K \u03baes r\n\n= 6.94 \u00d7 104 g cm\u22122 r11 mBH, 1 \u03b1\u22121\n\u22121 ,\n\nwhere \u03b6 is a logarithmic derivative involving s that is of order\nunity (Chen et al. 1995), or\n\u1e40 2\nc ,\n2\u03c0r2 s\n\n(32)\n\nand strong winds would be generated at all radii. Solving for\nthe disk variables with P = Prad and h/r = 1 yields\n\nwhere the advective transport\n\nQ\u2212\nadv =\n\n32\u03c0 c\nr,\n3 \u03baes\n\nSince there is no dependence on accretion rate, this state\nwould persist, in theory, until \u1e40 dropped below \u1e40E at the\nouter edge. An annular region with constant \u1e40 (r) would\nthen begin to propagate to smaller radii. This appears at\nfirst glance to raise the intriguing possibility of applying\nthis long period of constant accretion onto the central engine to explain the plateau phase of the light curve shown\nin Fig. 1 (segment II). If each annulus in the disk emits\nat roughly its local Eddington limit, an integration over the\ndisk shows that the total accretion luminosity can exceed LE\nby a factor \u223c ln(\u1e40 [router ]/\u1e40E [rinner ]) (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973; Begelman, King, & Pringle 2006) which would\nhave a value \u223c 10 in the current application. However, the\ninferred GRB segment II luminosity LII \u2243 3 \u00d7 1043 erg\ns\u22121 (fbeam /3 \u00d7 10\u22123) greatly exceeds even this enhanced Eddington value \u223c 10 \u00d7 LE (10M\u2299 ) \u223c 1040 erg s\u22121 , unless\nthe beaming factor were orders of magnitude smaller than the\nvalue 3\u00d710\u22123 we take in this study.

GENERAL SCENARIO\n\nWe argue that the entire X-ray sequence spanning > 106\ns can be understood in terms of the external accretion disk\npassing through a sequence of different physical states. We\npropose that the jet becomes active almost immediately after\ncreation of the BH and the beginning of formation of the fallback disk. The subsequent decrease in X-ray luminosity is\nthen due to the decreasing mass supply in the inner disk. The\ncurrent paradigm is that a jet of material launched from the\ncore of the progenitor decelerates as it encounters circumstellar material (Sari et al. 1999; Frail et al. 2001).\nIn the following discussion of the four Zhang et al. regimes,\nwe adopt GRB 060729 as a specific example due to its very\nlong coverage both in terms of flux decay and time (both span\n\u223c 7 decades \u2212 see Grupe et al. 2007 for a detailed study).\nThe light curve (Grupe et al. 2007, see their Fig. 4; Willingale et al. 2007, see their Fig. 10) shows a 0.3 \u2212 10 keV\nflux initially at \u223c 3 \u00d7 10\u22127 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 at \u223c 100s, decreasing to \u223c 2 \u00d7 10\u221211 at \u223c 103 s, then down slightly to\n\u223c 10\u221211 by \u223c 5 \u00d7 104 s, and finally to \u223c 3 \u00d7 10\u221214 at\n4 Menou, Perna, & Hernquist (2001, see their Appendix A2) neglect the \u1e40\n(and hence \u03a3) dependence of \u03bd, and therefore effectively derive a similarity\nsolution for a disk with constant irradiation.\n\n\f7\n\u223c 5 \u00d7 106 s. The redshift z = 0.54 gives, for the standard cosmology, a luminosity distance dL = 3.1 Gpc, so that\n4\u03c0d2L \u2243 1.15 \u00d7 1057 cm2 . To take into account cosmological time dilation the long term light curve depicted schematically in Fig. 1 should also be contracted along the x\u2212axis\nby a factor 1 + z = 1.54. Adopting a geometric beaming factor fbeam \u223c 3 \u00d7 10\u22123 , a beam efficiency \u01ebbeam =\nLbeam/(\u1e40 c2 ) \u223c 0.1, and neglecting the bolometric correction, the plateau flux FXRT, II \u2243 10\u221211 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 translates into an isotropic luminosity 4\u03c0d2L FXRT, II = 1.2 \u00d7 1046\nerg s\u22121 , a beaming corrected luminosity LII = 3.6 \u00d7 1043\nerg s\u22121 , and a rest mass-energy flux in the disk \u1e40 c2 =\nLII /\u01ebbeam = 3.6 \u00d7 1044 erg s\u22121 , which would not be directly observable presumably due to the advective nature of\nthe inner disk. This value is significantly in excess of the Eddington value LE \u2243 1.3 \u00d7 1039 (MBH /10M\u2299) erg s\u22121 . It is\nalso important to acknowledge that the very long duration of\nthe plateau for GRB 060729, \u223c 50, 000s, is not typical. Dainotti et al. (2008) find a range between about 102 s and 105 s in\nplateau duration, corrected to the source frame.\nTaking fbeam = 3 \u00d7 10\u22123 and \u01ebbeam = 0.1 for entire\nevolution shown in Fig. 1 (which is probably unrealistic),\nthe amount of matter accreted during each segment is 1.5 \u00d7\n10\u22124 M\u2299 for the prompt emission out to 100s, 5.5 \u00d7 10\u22125M\u2299\nfor segment I, 8.5 \u00d7 10\u22126 M\u2299 for segment II, 2.4 \u00d7 10\u22125 M\u2299\nfor segment III, and 1.7 \u00d7 10\u22126 M\u2299 for segment IV. It is important to note that these numbers represent the bookkeeping\nassociated with the powering of the jet, which we are assuming produces the X-rays. Given the likelihood of significant\nmass depletion within the disk, e.g., \u1e40 (r) \u221d rs , with s in\nthe range 0 to 1 (Kumar et al. 2008a), the actual total mass\navailable from fall-back could be orders of magnitude larger,\n\u223c 0.1 \u2212 1M\u2299. Given the long term persistence of the external\ndisk, the logarithmic rate of decay for each of the four segments identified by Zhang et al. (2006) must be relatable to\ndifferent physical regimes the disk passes through during its\nlong period of mass depletion:\n3.1. Segment I: Fall-back Debris\n3\n\u03b1I \u2243 3 for 102 <\n\u223c t <\n\u223c 10 s: During this early time the\ninner disk is being dynamically assembled out of fall-back\nmaterial, and so the assumptions entering into the similarity solution for the evolution of the external disk are not yet\nvalid. Kumar, Narayan, & Johnson (2008a) considered the\nevolution of debris from the SN event that disrupts the progenitor and creates the BH and subsequent GRB, and show\nanalytically that the arrival of material onto the BH from\nthe collapse of the outer half of the progenitor core leads to\n\u1e40 \u223c t\u22123 . In their model the rapid infall of matter arises because of the steep density profile of the outer core. During\n10\nthis early period of extremely high accretion rate >\n\u223c 10 LE\ninitially, the inner disk may contain regions where the cooling\nis neutrino-dominated and then advection-dominated. During\nthe early, chaotic phase of fall-back and accretion, the high\nrate of accretion significantly depletes the amount of material\nsurrounding the BH.\nIt has been suggested that early in the evolution of the disk\nself-gravity may play a role (e.g., Perna, Armitage, & Zhang\n2006). Therefore it may be possible to account for this early\nevolution purely within the confines of an accretion disk formalism, through considering self-gravitating disks (J. Pringle,\n2008, private communication), although it is not clear a priori\nwhether such a steep decay law can be obtained. If there is\n\nstill substantial material at small radii left over from the immediate post-GRB accretion (MacFadyen & Woosley 1999),\nit may be possible to model this decay time as a disk with selfgravity driving the viscosity. Detailed numerical calculations\nof self-gravitating disks support the contention that the selfgravity torque can be efficient enough to maintain the disk\nat the edge of instability to self-gravity, and that the relevant\nphysical length scales are small, of order the disk thickness h,\nin which case a local viscosity formalism can be utilized (e.g.,\nLodato & Rice 2004).\n3.2. Segment II: Transient Plateau\n4\n\u03b1II \u2243 0.5 for 103 <\n\u223c t <\n\u223c 10 s: The isotropic luminosity observed during the plateau 1046 erg s\u22121 translates into\na mass accretion rate of \u223c 5 \u00d7 10\u22123 M\u2299 yr\u22121 after applying the corrections given earlier. We argue that the plateau\nstage occurs when a small amount of material forms a torus\nat the radius of the progenitor, \u223c 1011 cm. The similarity\nsolutions discussed earlier apply to accretion disks that have\nhad time to adjust into a quasi-equilibrium profile which is\nclose to steady-state. Therefore in practice there will be a period of adjustment during which time the small amount of gas\n\u22125\n(>\n\u223c 3 \u00d7 10 M\u2299 ) that once was part of the envelope of the\nprogenitor becomes stretched out due Keplerian shear into an\naccretion disk. The time dependent calculations of Cannizzo\net al. (1990) indicate a flat transient period in the light curve\nin response to an annulus of material being suddenly introduced near a central mass. An apparent problem with the\nlight curves shown in Cannizzo et al. (1990, see their Fig.\n3) is that the transient plateaus shown there have slightly increasing fluxes, whereas the Swift XRT plateaus are flat or\ndecaying. The initial conditions for their time dependent calculations were tori with physically ad hoc Gaussian radial\nprofiles, \u03a3(r) \u221d exp[\u2212(r \u2212 rc )2 /(2w)2 ], with w/rc = 0.5.\nTherefore time was required after the calculations started for\nmatter to spread significantly to smaller radii, approach the\nstandard disk profile \u03a3(r) \u221d r\u22123/4 , and raise the central accretion rate onto the BH. For the present problem, however,\nit is more likely that one begins with significant amounts of\ngas at smaller radii. Therefore the accretion rate onto the BH\nwould reach a higher level more quickly, and the light curves\nwould be flat or decaying. Obviously, time-dependent accretion disk calculations for the present problem are desired,\nwere a physically motivated initial \u03a3(~r, ~v ) profile available\nfrom SN fall-back calculations.\nSince our scenario begins to come into play at the beginning\nof segment II, the accreted masses quoted earlier for segments\nII through IV must add up to a minimum for our initial disk\nmass, i.e., about 3.5 \u00d7 10\u22125 M\u2299 . The relation between \u03a30 , r0 ,\nand t0 given in eqn. (45), in combination with the numerical\nnormalization from Cannizzo et al. (1990, see their Fig. 3),\ncan be used to form a scaling for this interval\n7/3\n\n\u22124/3\n\nt0 \u2243 5 \u00d7 104 s r0, 11 \u03b1\u22121\n\n\u22122/3\n\n1/3\n\nMd, \u22124.5 mBH, 1 ,\n\n(59)\n\nwhere r0, 11 = r0 /1011 cm, and Md, \u22124.5 = Mdisk /10\u22124.5\nM\u2299 . We argue that this plateau period corresponds to Zhang\net al's phase II.\n3.3. Segment III\n3.3.1. Standard Disk\n\n< 5\n\u03b1III \u2243 1.2 for 104 <\n\u223c t \u223c 10 s: This segment corresponds\nto the standard model for the outer disk for which the solution given earlier applies. Gas left over from the progenitor\n\n\f8\n\nCANNIZZO & GEHRELS\n\nenvelope at \u223c 1011 cm has become smeared out and evolved\ninto the radial profile of an accretion disk, and now the classical similarity solution for the decay begins to apply. The\ndisk mass varies as t\u22123/16 so the luminosity, which scales\nwith dMd /dt, varies as t\u221219/16 \u2243 t\u22121.2 . For other opacity\nlaws \u03ba = \u03ba0 \u03c1a T b , Cannizzo, Lee, & Goodman (1990) found\nd log L/d log t = \u2212(38 + 18a \u2212 4b)/(32 + 17a \u2212 2b). This reduces to the electron scattering limit (\u221219/16) for a = b = 0.\nIn the optically thick limit, the decay rate is relatively insensitive to the opacity law. For instance, a Kramer's law a = 1,\nb = \u22123.5, gives a decay rate d log L/d log t = \u22125/4.\n3.3.2. Super-Eddington Slim Disk/ADAF-like state\n\nFor GRBs with high rates of accretion in the post fallback disk, conditions may be so extreme that the standard\nmodel is not relevant. Therefore the super-Eddington slim\ndisk must be considered. In section 2.4.2 we present the\ntime dependent solution for such disks, and show that for\nearly times d log L/d log t = \u22124/3, which would probably\nbe indistinguishable in the XRT data from the standard disk\nvalue d log L/d log t = \u221219/16. Kumar, Narayan, & Johnson (2008a; see their sections 3.1 and 3.2) take a different\napproach in calculating the time dependent evolution of the\ntransient disk. Rather than solving the \u03a3(r, t) evolution equation they prescribe a functional form \u1e40 (r) \u221d rs , and then\nsolve for the total disk angular momentum, mass, and outer\nradius. The motivation for this \u1e40 (r) form is that for \"ADAFlike\" conditions one expects strong mass outflow driven by a\npositive Bernoulli constant (Narayan & Yi 1994, 1995). Thus\ns = 0 would represent no mass loss, and s = 1 would correspond to a flow in which 90% of the mass is lost from the disk\nfor each inward decade in radius. This technique bypasses the\nneed for a detailed treatment of the \u03a3(r, t) evolution equation and the kinematic viscosity \u03bd. It also ignores any potential transient phase through which the disk might have to\nevolve, and therefore assumes that the disk goes immediately\ninto its equilibrium state. They derive a luminosity decay law\nLd (t) \u221d t\u22124(s+1)/3 , which reduces to t\u22124/3 for s = 0. This\nagrees with our law for super-Eddington slim disks at early\ntimes.\n3.4. Segment IV\n3.4.1. Irradiation Dominated Disk\n6\n\u03b1IV \u2243 2 for t >\n\u223c 10 s: Menou, Perna, & Hernquist (2001)\nconsider the evolution of supernova fall-back disks and find\n6\nthat irradiation becomes important at late times t >\n\u223c 10 s.\nSince the radial decrease in irradiation temperature is flatter\nthan that for disk temperature (r\u22121/2 versus r\u22123/4 ), as the\ndisk mass decreases and the surface densities and temperatures in the outer disk continue to drop, at some point the condition Tirr > Tviscous will be satisfied, and the standard model\nsimilarity solution will be supplanted by the irradiation model\nsolution. Moreover, a strong wind will begin to deplete significantly the disk mass, at a rate that exceeds the local mass\nflow (Begelman, McKee, & Shields 1983, Begelman & McKee 1983, Shields et al. 1986). Therefore the decay rate will\nsteepen from the standard model value \u03b1 \u2243 1.2. Begelman,\nMcKee, & Shields (1983, see their eqn. [4.2]), derive a characteristic mass loss rate due to a Compton heated wind\n\u00131/3\n\u0012\nLcr\n,\n(60)\n\u1e40ch = 4.5 \u00d7 10\u22127 M\u2299 yr\u22121 \u03b6L38\nL\n\nwhere \u03b6 is a collection of factors of order unity, and Lcr \u2243\n0.03LE. Taking a luminosity L = \u01eb\u1e40 c2 gives\n1/3\n\n\u1e40ch \u2243 2 \u00d7 10\u22123 M\u2299 yr\u22121 (\u01eb\u22121 \u1e41\u22122 )2/3 mBH, 1 ,\n\n(61)\n\nwhich will serve as a strong source of mass depletion in the\nouter disk.\nThe time-dependent decay solution for the wind-driven\nphase presented in section 2.4.3 is not complete because it\ndoes not include the effect of mass decrease on \u03a3(r, t). Also,\nthe decay law, \u03b1IV = 4/3, is the same as the early-time solution for the super-Eddington slim disk, therefore could not\naccount for the steepening decay for segment IV. The generalized Kumar et al. (2008a) decay solution in the presence of\na disk wind, Ld (t) \u221d t\u22124(1+s)/3 , provides more insight into\nthe potential effect of a wind. The fact that when a segment\nIV is observed it has a steeper slope than segment III suggests that if there are ADAF-like conditions in the disk early\non, mass loss is not significant since the observed decay rate\nagrees with theoretical one if s \u2243 0. Since the ADAF-like\nstate is supposed to be driven by a positive Bernoulli constant, as the disk mass drains and physical conditions within\nthe disk become less extreme, one would not expect for mass\nloss to become stronger if the positive Bernoulli constant were\nthe only force driving mass loss. However, in the picture of\nMenou, Perna, & Hernquist (2001), in which irradiation becomes important at later times as a strong agent in driving a\nwind, a power law \u1e41(r) \u221d rs to characterize the variation of\nmass flow within the disk in the presence of strong evaporation may become relevant. The steeper decay law in segment\nIV would then indicate a significant non-zero s value: for example a nominal value s \u2243 0.5 would be required to obtain\nLd (t) \u221d t\u22122 .\n3.4.2. Super-Eddington Slim Disk, late time solution\n\nIn section 2.4.2 we found that for the time dependent super\u22121\nEddington slim disk, the disk mass for t >\n\u223c 0.1(\u03b1\u03a90 ) varies\n\u22124/3\n\u22127/3\nas Md (t) \u221d t\n, and therefore Ld (t) \u221d t\n. This is close\nto the \u03b1IV \u2243 2 from Zhang et al. (2006) and suggests another possibility for the late time decay. In section 2.3.1 we\npresented the standard scalings for usual accretion disk with\n\u03bd \u221d Pgas and \u03ba = \u03baes . A look at the various self-consistency\ntests showed that most of them were at least marginally validated for conditions expected in the outer disk during segment\nII. However, the range of isotropic-equivalent luminosities for\nsegment II (Dainotti et al. 2008) can range up to \u223c 2 orders\nof magnitude greater than that adopted in section 2.3.1, which\nwould place an uncomfortable strain on the standard model.\nFor GRBs with outer disks at such extreme conditions that the\nstandard model does not apply, the super-Eddington slim disk\nmaybe a better description. The range in LII values shown\nin Dainotti et al. (2008) appear to show an intrinsic scatter,\ntherefore there may be GRBs for which the standard model\ndoes apply at late times (low LII ), and others for which the\nslim disk model is required (high LII ). One prediction of this\nidea would be that intrinsically brighter bursts would be more\nlikely to exhibit a segment IV, with its steeper decay. However, for the fainter bursts one would not be able to follow the\nlate-time decay to as low a flux level, and therefore it might\nbe difficult to make a definitive observational statement about\nthe presence of a segment IV.\n3.5. Mass supply: Viscous accretion vs. Fall-back\n\n\f9\nKumar et al. (2008b) present and discuss the criteria for determining whether viscous accretion or fall-back will be the\nprimary supply mechanism feeding mass into the central engine. Both processes will influence the light curve, but the\none with the longer time scale is likely to have the dominant\neffect. After the SN has occurred, the fall-back time for an element of gas in the progenitor envelope to fall from radius r to\nthe BH is roughly the free-fall time tfb \u223c 2(r3 /GMBH )1/2 .\n(This ignores any residual pressure support during the collapse, and other effects such as a wind from the accretion\ndisk and a shock originating near the BH during its formation.) Inverting this expression gives the radius in the star\nexpected to be accreting at a given time t after the SN oc2/3 1/3\ncurs, r10 \u2243 1.5t2 mBH, 1 , where t2 = t/100 s. The spe1/2\n\n1/2\n\ncific angular momentum j\u2217,18 = 3.6mBH, 1 r10 f\u03a9 (r), where\nj\u2217,18 is in units of 1018 cm2 s\u22121 , and f\u03a9 (r) is the local angular velocity of a gas at radius r in the progenitor, in terms of\nthe Keplerian value \u03a9K . After the SN explosion, gas which\nends up being trapped in the potential well of the BH will\nfall inward to the point where it hits its angular momentum\nbarrier, determined by f\u03a9 (r). This viscous accretion time\nscale tacc \u2243 (r/h)2 (\u03b1\u03a9K [rcirc ])\u22121 \u2248 2\u03b1\u22121 \u03a9K \u22121 (rcirc )\n(since h/r \u2243 1), where rcirc is the circularization radius\n\u223c j\u22172 /(GMBH ). This line of reasoning leads to eqn. [4] of\nKumar et al. (2008b),\n3\n(62)\ntacc /tfb \u2243 10\u03b1\u22121\n\u22121 f\u03a9 (r).\nKumar et al. (2008b) note that this relation implies the accretion time will be shorter than the fall-back time, and therefore\nsubordinate as a mass supply mechanism, for f\u03a9 (r) <\n\u223c 0.4.\nThey find that the steep decay segment (I) would be possible\nonly if the disk can adjust rapidly to a decrease in \u1e40fb , and\nuse this consideration to place an upper limit on the rotation\nspeed in the core (on the assumption that segment I is due to\nfall-back of the progenitor core). Their approach is strengthened by our finding that all plausible disk states give decay\nrates with power laws <\n\u223c 2, too shallow to explain segment I.\nAt early times before the disk has had a significant opportunity to spread, the fundamental physical considerations presented by Kumar et al. (2008b) seem well-motivated. At later\ntimes, however, the increasing viscous time scale associated\nwith the outer disk edge, and the maintenance of a causal\ncoupling to smaller radii, via angular momentum transport,\nbegin to introduce a significant correction factor that must\nbe taken into account in eqn. (62). It is important to note\nthat implicit in the derivation of eqn. (62) is that the radius\nappearing in the fall-back time and the viscous time are the\nsame. However, the spread of the outer disk edge introduces a\nstrong nonlocality: instead of taking tacc \u221d \u03b1\u22121 \u03a9K \u22121 (rcirc )\none should more properly consider \u03b1\u22121 \u03a9K \u22121 (rdisk, outer ).\nSince tacc varies as r3/2 , this introduces a correction factor (rdisk, outer /rcirc )3/2 into eqn. (62). Taking a fiducial\nspreading rate (r/r0 ) = (t/t0 )3/8 as in the standard solution, and adopting typical numbers for times separating the\ndifferent segments, tI/II \u2243 103 s, tII/III \u2243 5 \u00d7 104 s, and\ntIII/IV \u2243 3 \u00d7 106 s, this implies an increase over the locally\ndefined (i.e., at rcirc ) accretion time scale by a factor \u223c 8 at\ntII/III and \u223c 90 at tIII/IV , respectively (stemming from increases of rdisk, outer by a factor 4 from tI/II to tII/III , and\nby a factor 20 from tI/II to tIII/IV ). The faster rate of expansion calculated by Kumar et al. (2008a), (r/r0 ) = (t/t0 )2/3 ,\nwould give larger correction factors. Also, these factors are\n\nactually lower limits because they only take into account the\nexpansion of the disk relative to tI/II . The disk expansion enhances the effect of the accretion supply with respect to the\nmass supply by prolonging tacc , and also facilitates an understanding of why the steepest decay (segment I) must occur\nat the earliest time possible, before the significant outward\nmovement in rdisk, outer has enforced tacc >> tfb .\nKumar et al. (2008b) present examples of 4 Swift GRBs\nfor which \u03b1III \u2243 4 \u2212 6, much steeper than in the standard\nZhang et al. (2006) picture \u03b1III \u2243 1.2. For these rare bursts\nthe Kumar et al. fall-back scenario may well provide a better\ndescription than our viscous accretion disk scenario.\n4. DISCUSSION\n\nThe overarching question behind this study is the follow6\ning: Is the very long term (t >\n\u223c 10 s) decay seen in the X-ray\nflux from GRBs due to the deceleration of a relativistic jet,\nor to a decreasing mass supply onto the central engine? We\nargue in favor of the latter. We have presented a general scenario for understanding the long term evolution, in particular\nthe four power law decay segments found through Swift XRT\nobservations. The basic idea relies on the fact that the everexpanding outer edge maintains a causal connection through\nthe intervening radii all the way to the inner disk, given the\ncoupling of the viscosity mechanism to the local shear in the\ndisk. In more basic terms, the mass of the accretion disk decreases as a power law in time, resulting in a decrease in mass\naccretion rate at the inner edge.\nThe overall evolution is as follows:\n(I) The initial steep decay phase arises from the dynamical fall-back of \u223c 0.1M\u2299 of material into the vicinity of\nthe BH (Kumar, Narayan, & Johnson 2008ab). Kumar et al.\n2008b show by comparing the viscous and fall-back times in\nthe early stages of fall-back that tacc << tfb . The disk therefore responds quickly to the steeply decreasing, externally imposed mass supply from the progenitor core. This scenario is\nonly possible at early times before expansion of the outer accretion disk causes tacc > tfb . An alternative but perhaps\nless likely possibility for the steep decay involves completely\ndifferent physics (Pe'er et al.5 2006).\n(II) The initial establishment of the disk leads to a brief\ntransient phase during which calculations indicate a flat light\ncurve. This corresponds to the viscous smearing and spreading of gas left over from the progenitor envelope into an accretion disk (Cannizzo et al. 1990), which we take to lie at\nroughly the progenitor radius \u223c 1011 cm. The dynamical time\n3\nscale there \u03a9\u22121\nK \u223c 10 s is toward the lower range of observed\nplateau durations (Dainotti et al. 2008, se their Figs. 1 and 2),\nand our scaling for the transient period following the arrival\nof material to establish the accretion disk is in line with the\nduration of the plateau phase seen in some of the XRT light\ncurves.\nThe plateau phase has been ascribed by previous workers\nto continued activity of the central engine, or to the accretion\ndisk having low value of the Shakura-Sunyaev \u03b1 parameter\n(e.g., Kumar, Narayan, & Johnson 2008a; although in their\nfinal analysis they downgrade this possibility). Given the apparent robustness of the non-linear saturation limit of the viscosity parameter in the MRI process (Beckwith, Hawley, &\n5 Their explanation, which involves a hot cocoon with modest Lorentz\nfactor and a nearly thermal spectrum, may be refuted by Swift observations\nshowing that the GRB prompt emission joins smoothly to segment I \u2212 an unlikely coincidence given that the hot cocoon represents an independent physical component.\n\n\f10\n\nCANNIZZO & GEHRELS\n\nKrolik 2008), however, we also view the small \u03b1 explanation\nas unlikely. Kumar, Narayan, & Johnson (2008a) view as a\nmore plausible explanation continued fall-back onto the central BH. Kumar, Narayan, & Johnson (2008b; see their Fig. 2)\npresent conditions for the core/envelope density structure of\nthe progenitor that would be required to obtain the plateau (as\nwell as the steeper segments - I and III). In the previous section we showed how the spreading of the outer disk enhances\nthe effective viscous accretion time, relative to the fall-back\ntime, and ensures that viscous accretion will become increasingly dominant as the outer disk expands significantly beyond\nwhat had been the radius of the progenitor.\n(III) After the transient period, the outer disk becomes describable using the standard formalism (t\u22121.2 decay) or an\nadvective formalism (t\u22121.3 decay). The continued high rate\nof accretion substantially depletes the mass of the disk. The\ninner disk is still not only substantially super-Eddington (by\na factor \u223c 105 \u2212 107 ) but also potentially degenerate due to\nthe very high densities (e.g., Narayan, Piran, & Kumar 2001,\nKohri & Mineshige 2002, Kohri, Narayan, & Piran 2005,\nChen & Beloborodov 2007, Ohsuga & Mineshige 2007).\n(IV) At some point the outer disk may become not only radiation dominated, but also subject to a substantial Compton\ndriven wind, leading to an increase in the decay rate. If the\nrate of mass flow within the body of the disk can be characterized \u1e40 (r) \u221d rs as in Kumar et al. (2008a), then their\ndecay solution Ld (t) \u221d t\u22124(1+s)/3 would provide a good fit\nfor s \u2248 0.5 regardless of whether the disk was standard or\nadvective. Alternatively, our late time super-Eddington slimdisk solution Ld (t) \u221d t\u22127/3 may apply at this time.\nDepending on details such as the initial mass of the disk,\nstates (II) and (IV) may or may not become manifest in the\nlong term light curve.\nThe current paradigm for the long term GRB light curves\nattributes changes seen in the decay properties to variations\n(i.e., a decrease) in the bulk Lorentz flow of a jet of material\nexpelled from the central engine as it collides with and interacts with circumstellar material. We argue that a strong jet is\nestablished almost immediately after the GRB prompt emission, and the subsequent decay properties of the light curve\nare set by a dwindling mass supply due to the long term decrease in \u03a3 at all radii. The decay law obtained by Kumar et\nal. (2008a) in which LX \u221d t\u22124(s+1)/3 , where the mass loss\nrate from the disk varies as rs , allows for a range of decay between t\u22124/3 and t\u22128/3 . The steeper decay, as an explanation\nfor segment III, seems to be excluded by the data (e.g., Ghisellini et al. 2009, see their Fig. 16). If the slim disk/ADAF\npicture proves to be a valid description of the outer disk, the\nobserved segment III decay rate would appear to argue against\na strongly varying mass loss rate with radius. Also, the potential bimodality in decay rate with time found in section 2.4.2\nfor the slim disk state, t\u22124/3 for early times and t\u22127/3 for late\ntimes, might play a role in the III/IV transition. The dividing\n\u22121/2 \u22121\n3/2\n, so for this to work the\npoint lies at \u223c 103 s r0, 11 mBH, 1 \u03b1\u22121\n>\ndisk would have to have expanded to \u223c 1012 cm to account for\nthe long time scale \u223c 104 \u2212 105 s of the III/IV transition. Alternatively, the onset of a strong wind at late times, driven by\nirradiation, may force s to increase from 0 to \u223c 0.5, thereby\nsteepening the decay in segment IV.\nIn addition to our alternative explanation for the plateau\nseen in some of the XRT light curves, there is also an issue raised by the high-latitude emission model (Kumar &\n\nPanaitescu 2000). In this model, after the mechanism responsible for producing X-ray emission ceases, an observer along\nthe central jet axis sees continued emission as photons from\nincreasingly off-axis lines of sight continue to arrive. For uniform surface brightness, an intrinsic spectrum \u03bd \u2212\u03b2 produces\na power law decay in time t\u2212\u03b1 , where \u03b1 = \u03b2 + 2. This prediction was tested by O'Brien et al. (2006, see their Fig. 4)\nfor the initial decay segment (Zhang et al's I) using a large\nsample of Swift GRBs. Instead of \u03b1 \u2243 \u03b2 + 2, they found\na scatterplot in \u03b1 versus \u03b2. Thus the standard model also\nseems problematic for decay segment I as regards the temporal/spectral evolution, although more recent work on the\nhigh-latitude \"curvature effect\" has been promising (Zhang et\nal. 2007, 2009).\n5. IMPLICATIONS\n\nEqn. (1) of Sari, Piran, & Halpern (1999) has proven of\ngreat use to observers insofar as it relates observable quantities, namely jet break time, redshift, and GRB fluence, to\na beaming angle (assuming a density of the circumstellar\nmedium). The outline of the theory we present is not yet\nsufficiently developed to build a complex formalism. Simple\nstatements can still be made, however. Our eqn. (59) gives an\napproximate scaling for the time of the segment II/III transition. If the luminosity of the plateau scales roughly with the\nmass accumulated during fall-back that supplies the transient\ndisk associated with the plateau (segment II) in our model,\nthen eqn. (59) predicts an inverse scaling between LX,II and\n\u22123/2\ntII, III , namely LX,II \u221d tII, III . (This ignores the r0 scaling,\nhowever.) An inverse correlation is observed in the data, but\n\u22120.8\nappears less steep (LX,II \u221d tII,\nIII ) than our prediction (Dainotti, Cardone, & Capozziello 2008; see their Figs. 1 and 2).\nThe Kumar et al. (2008a) decay law with mass loss from\nthe disk, Ld (t) \u221d t\u22124(1+s)/3 , is consistent with our early\ntime decay law for the super-Eddington slim disk, and with\nthe observed value \u03b1III \u2243 1.2, for s = 0. It is also close\nto the decay law for standard disks, Ld (t) \u221d t\u221219/16 . This\nappears to indicate that for very high \u1e40 disks where the standard model is not applicable during segments II and III, if an\nADAF-like state is correct, then mass loss must be minimal\n(i.e., s \u2243 0, or \u1e40 (r) \u2243 constant). The steepening then associated with segment IV could either be due to the onset of\nsignificant evaporation, e.g., s \u2243 0.5 would be sufficient, or\nthe late time super-Eddington slim disk law Ld (t) \u221d t\u22127/3 .\nIf our model has some merit, then a revision in current\nthinking would be needed. First, there may not be a standard GRB energy reservoir as in Frail et al. (2001). Also,\nfor the jet to respond quickly to whatever conditions prevail\nat the central engine (i.e., accretion rate), it may need to be a\nlight-weight jet with a low degree of baryon loading. It may\nbe a Poynting-flux dominated jet as in the model of Lyutikov\n& Blandford (2003). The deceleration experienced by such a\njet would tend to be less, for a given energy flux. The previous estimates of the circumstellar density field n(r) would\nneed to be revised. Conversely, the jet may be baryon-loaded\nduring the steep decay segment (segment I) which appears to\nbe too steep to be covered within an accretion disk formalism.\nThe spectral evolution observed during this phase may be difficult to account for with a purely EM jet (O'Brien et al. 2006;\nPe'er et al. 2006). There may also be some baryon loading\nduring the rest of the decay, but the density of the circumstellar medium would need to be less than previously thought, so\nthat deceleration would be minimal.\n\n\f11\nIn this work we have implicitly assumed that the X-ray light\ncurve represents the bulk of the radiated jet energy. Therefore our model runs into the same difficulty as the standard\nmodel in accounting for why the breaks seen at other wavelengths do not follow the X-ray. The physical emission mechanisms must differ across different wavebands, which could\nalso potentially mitigate one of the criticisms of the standard\nmodel. One idea currently being discussed is that, within a\ngiven GRB there can co-exist jets with different opening angles and different physical conditions, each of which can contribute preferentially to emission in different wavebands. If\nthe opening angles are considerably different, this could lead\nto different break times (e.g., Racusin et al., 2008). Our simple model is not yet developed enough to make any predictions on the relative rates of decay at different wavelengths.\nThere are other important issues to consider, such as the\nformation and stability of an accretion disk in the middle of a\nsupernova. Enough material would have to be evacuated from\nthe vicinity of the disk near the BH at early times to permit the\ndisk to survive the expected shocks and radiation of the explosion. Also, if the BH acquires a kick velocity vkick during the\ninitial explosion, this velocity would have to be small enough\nso that the accretion disk was not left behind. (A simple consideration of the binding energy shows that matter in the disk\n\u22121/2\n1/2\n> vkick , where\nwith vorbit = 1155 km s\u22121 mBH, 1 r11\n\u22121\nvkick \u2243 100 \u2212 300 km s , should remain bound to the BH.)\nFinally, the jet issuing from the BH would have to be powerful enough to punch through the veil of material comprising\n6\nthe ejecta, and to maintain an open channel for >\n\u223c 10 s. If the\njet is primarily electromagnetic as opposed to baryon-loaded,\nthe open EM field lines may help in maintaining a clear path\nfor the jet beam.\nRecently various workers have proposed a simple way for\nobtaining the flat decay associated with segment II. Implicit\nin our work and that of others such as Kumar et al. (2008ab)\nis that the start of the prompt emission is the relevant start\ntime for all the other emission \u2212 X-ray, optical, and radio. It\nis possible that the physical mechanism responsible for producing the X-rays actually commences \u223c 104 \u2212 105 s before\nthe prompt emission, so that the flat appearance of segment\nII is merely due to having an incorrect start time (Yamazaki\n2009; Liang et al. 2009). Yamazaki (2009) plots four examples of GRBs for which a shifting of the start time for the\nX-ray decay produces a good fit for the plateau, after having\noptimized the decay for segment III. One can however find\n\nother examples of GRBs for which there is a gradual decay\nin segment II that is not well-fit by simply shifting the start\ntime, therefore this explanation may not work for all GRBs.\nAlso, it remains unclear as to how the X-ray emission could\nbegin significantly before the GRB, which presumably marks\nthe moment of explosion of the progenitor and formation of\nthe BH.\n6. CONCLUSION\n\nWe present a new paradigm for understanding the long-term\nbehavior of GRBs, as inferred primarily through Swift XRT\nobservations. We argue that the four power law segments into\nwhich the long term XRT light curves can be divided can be\nexplained by the time dependent evolution of the external accretion disk. The initial, steep period of decay happens before\nthe external accretion disk has been established and therefore\nis beyond our scope (although a self-gravitating disk remains\na possibility). Simple estimates of the accretion and fall-back\ntime scales tacc and tfb indicate that fall-back will be dominant at the earliest times. Therefore the fact that segment I\nhas the steepest slope, too steep to be accounted for by the\ndisk models we study, strengthens the picture advocated in\nKumar et al. (2008b) in which the direct fall-back of the progenitor core leads to segment I. After the initial evolution,\nexpansion of the outer disk edge enforces tacc > tfb so that\naccretion is dominant. We ascribe the subsequent flattening\nin the GRB light curves to a period of viscous re-adjustment\nin the accretion disk formed out of the gas elements from the\nprogenitor envelope that remain bound to the BH and end up\nat their specific angular momentum radii after the hypernova\nexplosion. The following steepening corresponds to the similarity solution for the decay of a standard disk or advective\ndisk at the largest radii, and the further slight steepening at\nlater times could be due to the additional mass depletion from\na strong wind, or in some cases to the late time evolution of a\nsuper-Eddington slim disk.\n\nWe thank Kris Beckwith, Juhan Frank, Chris Fryer, Pranab\nGhosh, Josh Grindlay, Andrew King, Shin Mineshige, Jim\nPringle, Judy Racusin, Brad Schaefer, and Jan Staff for useful\ndiscussions.
