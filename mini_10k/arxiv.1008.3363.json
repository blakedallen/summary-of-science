We discuss\nthe possibility of observing quantum jumps in the number of photons and related applications.\nPACS numbers: 85.25.Cp, 42.50.Dv, 03.65.Ta, 85.25.Dq\n\nThe quantum measurement of harmonic oscillators is\na generic problem in quantum mechanics. One context\nin which this problem was analyzed is the detection of\ngravitational waves [1]. Another domain of application\nis quantum optics, where the measurement of the number\nof photons in single or multiple modes of electromagnetic\nfields is an essential tool for quantum field state tomography [2, 3], linear quantum computation [4], and quantum\ncommunication [5]. Most measurement schemes are hampered by either limited efficiency or large backaction. An\nideal measurement of an oscillator in the basis of Fock\nstates can be achieved by employing a quantum nondemolition (QND) strategy [6]. In contrast to non-ideal\nmeasurements, QND schemes offers interesting prospects\nfor preparation of Fock states on demand and application\nto detection of weak forces [7].\nQND detection of Fock states requires an interaction\nbetween the observed oscillator and the employed detector which depends on the position and/or momentum of\nthe former in a non-linear way. Finding a suitable nonlinear interaction is a difficult task. Up to date, this\nhas only been achieved in a few experiments. Examples include the measurement of an electron in a Penning trap [8], the measurement of microwave photons\nin a Fabry-Perot superconducting resonator [9], and the\nmeasurement of microwave photons in an on-chip superconducting cavity [10]. Furthermore, other QND measurement schemes based on nonlinear interactions have\nbeen proposed for nanomechanical systems [11] and for\nsuperconducting resonators [12].\nIn this letter we propose a method for the QND measurement of Fock states of a simple lumped electrical oscillator formed by a direct-current superconducting quantum interference device (DC-SQUID) and a capacitor.\nThe Fock states are photon number states stored in this\nmicrowave resonator. We show that it is possible to design an interaction between the observed resonator and\na second resonator which is quadratic in position-like\ncoordinates. Combined with a proper choice of reso-\n\nnant frequencies of the two resonators (i.e. sufficiently\nlarge detuning) this interaction can be used to measure\nthe number of photons in the resonator of interest by\nmonitoring the frequency of the second resonator. This\nmethod for QND detection of microwave photons is different to the experiment in [10], which was based on using\nthe dispersive regime of the Jaynes Cummings Hamiltonian [13], and the proposal in [12], which uses Josephson\njunctions to couple different modes of a single resonator.\nOur method has the advantage of very strong achievable\ncoupling resulting in a large signal to noise ratio (SNR)\nfor detection of up to 10 photons in the resonator. We\nperform a detailed analysis of the optimization of the\nnon-linear coupling used for measurement and the tradeoff between the strength of coupling and anharmonicity\nof each circuit.\nThe electrical resonator that we consider has the simple structure shown in Fig. 1a. It can be seen as an\nelectrical LC circuit formed of the capacitance C and a\nSQUID acting as an effective inductor. The SQUID is a\ntwo-terminal superconducting device formed of a superconducting loop interrupted by two Josephson junctions.\nA SQUID can be used as a sensitive magnetometer, based\non the property that its critical current depends on the\nmagnetic flux \u03a6 enclosed in its ring with a period equal\nto the flux quantum \u03a60 = h/2e [14]. For a current in\nthe SQUID below this critical current, the SQUID behaves as an inductor, with an inductance that depends\non the magnetic flux. Therefore, the circuit in Fig. 1a\ncan be seen as an LC resonator, with a resonance frequency dependent on the magnetic flux enclosed in the\nring. As such, this system was used for the readout of a\nflux qubit [15].\nAt non-integer values of the applied magnetic flux, a\nfinite screening current Is (circulating in the ring of the\nSQUID) arises. This is illustrated in Fig. 1b for different values of the applied flux f = \u03a6/\u03a60 and ratio\n\u03b2 = L/LJ of the geometric inductance of the SQUID\nring, L, to the Josephson inductance of each junction\n\n\f2\n(b) 1.0\nIt\nIs\nC\n\nIc\n\nf\n\nIc\n\nScreening current Is/Ic\n\n(a)\n\n0.8\n\nVi\n\nCg\n\nf=0.4, \u03b2=0.25\nf=0.4, \u03b2=0\nf=0, \u03b2=0\n\nIb,N\n\n0.4\n\nIc,N\n\n0.2\n\nfN\n\nCa,N\n\nVo\n\nM\n\n0.6\n\nIc,N Ic,D\n\nCJ,N CJ,N\n\nfD\n\nIc,D\nCa,D\n\nCJ,D CJ,D\n\n0.0\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\nTransport current It/Ic\n\n2\n\nFIG. 1.

For a symmetric\nSQUID this screening current is an even function of the\ntransport current It , and in particular it has a strong\nquadratic component. Therefore, different energy eigenstates in the SQUID, characterized by different transport\ncurrent quantum fluctuations, will result in different average values of the screening current. A second SQUID\nbased LC-resonator, acting as a flux detector, can then\nbe used to measure the screening current and therefore\nimplement a measurement of the energy, or equivalently\nof the photon Fock states, of the first SQUID. This is the\nbasis of the principle of detection. In the following we\npresent a full quantum mechanical calculation necessary\nto validate and understand the limits of this qualitative\nargument.\nFig. 2 shows the full circuit details used to model the\nmeasured (N ) and detection (D ) resonators. The two\nSQUIDS are symmetric, with junctions critical currents\nIc,\u03b1 , intrinsic junction capacitances CJ,\u03b1 , inductance L\u03b1\nin each arm (not shown), and magnetic flux f\u03b1 applied\nto each loop using an external source (not shown), with\n\u03b1 = N, D. Each SQUID is shunted by a capacitor Ca,\u03b1\nwith a much larger capacitance than the junction capacitors. The two SQUIDS are coupled through their mutual\ninductance M . A bias current source source Ib,N (t) is\nused to control the state of the observed resonator. The\ndetection resonator is coupled using a coupling capacitor\nCg to a transmission line of characteristic impedance Z0 .\nA wave of amplitude Vi and frequency \u03c9\u0304D is sent to the\ndetector resonator; the reflected wave amplitude, Vo , is\nmeasured and the result is used to infer the state of the\nN resonator.\nWe applied the rules of circuit quantization [16] to derive the quantum model of the complete circuit shown\nin Fig. 2. The two resonators can be described by six\ndegrees of freedom: the gauge invariant phases \u03b3i,\u03b1 over\nthe Josephson junctions (i = 1, 2 labels the two Josephson junctions in each SQUID) and the phases \u03b3a,\u03b1 (de-\n\nN\n\nD\n\nFIG. 2.

The resonance frequencies are\ngiven by \u03c9\u03b1 = p\u03b1 /LJ,\u03b1 C\u0304a,\u03b1 , with p\u03b1 = 2 cos \u03c0f\u03b1 +\nP L\u03b1\u03b2\nL\u2032\u03b1\u03b1\n2\n\u03b2 LJ,\u03b2 sin \u03c0f\u03b1 sin \u03c0f\u03b2 \u2212 LJ,\u03b1 cos \u03c0f\u03b1 .

The maximum number of photons, nmax,\u03b1 , is the number of photons corresponding to\na energy equal to approximately the modulation height\nof the potential energy for each SQUID; this is the maximum photon storage capacity for each resonator. Equation (6) shows that the optimal value of g is at best\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u03c9D \u03c9N / nmax,N nmax,D , multiplied by a factor of the\norder of the unity. With given resonant frequencies (fixed\nvalues of \u03c9D and \u03c9N ) g can be increased at the expense of\nnmax,D , however this leaves the fidelity of measurement\nunchanged (see discussion below). An augmentation of g\nis possible by reducing nmax,N .\nTo implement the measurement of the N resonator,\nthe D resonator is continuously monitored through the\n\n(8)\n\nwhere R is the quantum state of the combined detector\nand system. We assume that that we can neglect the selfanharmonicity of the D resonator and that |\u03c9D \u2212 \u03c9N | \u226b\n|J| so that the linear interaction can be ignored (it only\nshifts the frequencies of the resonators). We then follow\nthe procedure\nP outlined in Ref. [17]: the reduced state\n\u03c1 = Tr[R] = mn \u03c1mn |mihn| of the N resonator is found\nRt\nRt\n\u2032\nto be \u03c1mn = \u03c1mn (0) exp[\u2212i 0 H mn dt\u2032 \u2212 0 \u0393mn\nd dt ] where\nH mn = Hbmn + g(m \u2212 n)Re[\u03b1n \u03b1\u2217m ]\n1\n\u03ba\n\u0393mn\n= |\u03b1m \u2212 \u03b1n |2 + dt |\u03b1m \u2212 \u03b1n |2\nd\n2\n2\n\n(9)\n\nwith Hbmn = (\u03c9N \u2212 AN )(m \u2212 n) + AN (m2 \u2212 n2 ) and\n\u03b1\u0307n = \u2212i\u03b5\u0304D \u2212 i(\u2206 + gn)\u03b1n \u2212 \u03ba\u03b1n /2. Here \u2206 = \u03c9D \u2212 \u03c9\u0304D\nis the detuning between the driving and resonance frequency. In (9) the first equation represents the Hamiltonian evolution of the N resonator which comprises of\nboth bare evolution (first term) and the ac-Stark shift induced by the detection resonator. The second equation\nrepresents dephasing: it comprises of a term proportional\nto the information extracted by the detector (see below)\nand a second term which can be both positive and negative as it represents information flowing between the\ndetector and system that has not been extracted by the\nmonitoring.\nIn order to quantify the detection efficiency we consider\nthe problem of distinguishing a n from a n + 1 photon\nstate in the N resonator. In this case the measurement\nrate is\n= \u03ba|\u03b1n+1 \u2212 \u03b1n |2 .\n\u0393n,n+1\nm\n\n(10)\n\nThis can be interpreted as the leakage rate of the D\nSQUID resonator multiplied by the distance in phase\nspace of the two coherent states corresponding to n and\nn + 1 photons in the N resonator. With a detuning\n\u2206 = \u2212g(n + 1), the value of \u0393m is optimized for a given\ndriving strength amplitude \u03b5\u0304D . The driving strength can\nbe raised to the point where the number of photons in\nthe D resonator reaches the maximum photon number\nnmax,D . In this optimal condition, the measurement rate\nis\n\u0393n,n+1\n=\nm\n\n4nmax,D g 2\n[1 \u2212 exp(\u2212t\u03ba/2)]2 .\n\u03ba\n\n(11)\n\nFor a homodyne measurement, the signal to noise ratio for distinguishing n from n + 1 photons is related to\n\n\f4\nthe measurement rate through the relation [17] SNR =\nRT p\n( 0 m \u03b7\u0393m (t)dt)2 /Tm , where Tm is the integration time\nand \u03b7 is the detection efficiency for the wave reflected off\nthe D resonator, in practice limited by the available amplifier. Using Eq. (11), we find\n2 [\u03baTm\n\nSNR = \u03b74nmax,D (gTm )\n\n\u2212 2(1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03baTm /2 )]2\n. (12)\n(\u03baTm )3\n\nFor a given measurement time Tm , the maximum value\nof the SNR, SNRmax = 0.32 \u03b7nmax,D (gTm )2 , is attained\nwhen \u03ba = 4.3/Tm. Tm should be chosen to be of the\norder of the relaxation time Tn+1,n of the N resonator,\nas further increasing Td will corrupt the signal to noise\nratio. The optimization of the measurement amounts to\nmaximizing g 2 nmax,D , based on Eq. (6). The result of\nthe optimization is only weakly dependent on the resonance frequencies, as long as linear coupling is effectively suppressed (|\u03c9D \u2212 \u03c9N | \u226b |J|). High-efficiency microwave transistor based amplifiers with \u03b7 \u2248 1/20 are\navailable over a wide frequency range in the GHz domain, which allows for flexibility in choosing \u03c9D given\nany \u03c9N . Note: with the advent of quantum limited amplifiers [18], it will be possible to have \u03b7 . 1. To illustrate\nthe optimization procedure, we choose \u03c9D /2\u03c0 = 7 GHz\n\u03c9N /2\u03c0 = 4 GHz. Even though Eq. (6) indicates that\nwhen fD and fN tend towards 1/2 the value of g can\nreach its upper limit, we choose fD = 0.45 and fN = 0.45\nin order to reduce the effects due to the asymmetry of\nthe junctions and also to avoid too small values for the\nmaximum numbers of photons. We also assume the magnetic coupling constant to be k = 0.7. We then proceed\nto optimizing \u03b2D \u03b2N /nmax,N pN pD , under the constraint\n2\u03b2\u03b1 cos \u03c0f\u03b1 \u226a 1 (we take 2\u03b2\u03b1 cos \u03c0f\u03b1 to be less than\n0.1 and fixed values of \u03c9D and \u03c9N ). Note: pN and pD\nare implicit functions of \u03b2D , \u03b2N , \u03c9D , and \u03c9N . In the\noptimization procedure we choose to consider values of\nthe ratio LD /LN between 0.5 and 2. The reason for\nthis is that very dissimilar values of the loop inductances\nmake it difficult to reach large values of the magnetic coupling constant k with simple circuits. The optimization\nof the SNR over \u03b2D , \u03b2N , and LD /LN , leaves still one\nfree scaling parameter, which we take to be LJ,N . We\nset LJ,N to be 1.1 nH, corresponding to a critical current\nIc,N = 300 nA.\nIn Fig. 3a we show the optimal SNR, for \u03b7 = 1/20,\nversus the LD /LN ratio. With a value of Tm = 1 \u03bcs,\nconsistent with relaxation times of superconducting resonator with Josephson junctions [19], the SNR is above\n2000, which results in a fidelity for distinguishing n = 0\nfrom n = 1 above 99% [20]. The SNR for distinguishing\nn from n + 1 scales as 1/n2 due to the 1/n dependence of\nthe relaxation time Tn+1,n . Therefore we estimate that\nthe observation of up to 10 photons in the resonator can\nbe done with an SNR larger than 20 (state dependent)\nwhich should result in fidelities larger than 87%.

(Color online) (a) The SNR as a function of LD /LN .\n(b) The maximum number of photons that can be store in\neach resonator nmax,N and nmax,D versus LD /LN .\n\nshows that nmax,N is large: up to 30 photons can be\nheld in the N resonator, and nmax,D is large enough for\nthe linear approximation to hold. We note that to reach\nthe values of the SNR plotted in Fig. 3a, the parameters g/2\u03c0, AD /2\u03c0, AN /2\u03c0, and J/2\u03c0 are of the order of\n10 MHz. At this value of J, linear coupling is negligible.\nIn conclusion, we presented a new method for quantum\nnon-demolition detection of photons in a microwave resonator, based on a optimized non-linear interaction. We\nfind that large signal to noise ratio can be obtained for\nup to 10 photons, assuming resonator relaxation times of\nthe order of microseconds. The quantum non-demolition\nnature of the detection enables the monitoring of quantum jumps and related applications to detection of weak\nelectromagnetic fields [7].\nThis work was supported by an NSERC Discovery\ngrant.
