As described, e.g., by Makishima et al. (1986), the soft\nspectral component is interpreted as thermal emission from an optically thick accretion disk\naround the black hole, as it can be well reproduced by a multi-color disk model (MCD model;\nMitsuda et al. 1984). This model approximates a spectrum from a standard accretion disk\n(Shakura & Sunyaev 1973). The MCD model has two spectral parameters; the maximum\ndisk color temperature, Tin , and the apparent disk inner radius, rin ; the latter can be related\nto the true inner radius, Rin , via a correction for spectral hardening (Shimura & Takahara\n1997) and a boundary condition (Kubota et al. 1998). As the disk luminosity changes significantly, the value of Rin is usually observed to remain constant at the innermost Keplerian\norbit for the black hole, 6Rg where Rg = GM/c2 is the gravitational radius (e.g., Ebisawa\net al. 1993).\nAlthough this \"standard picture\" is successful for many of the high/soft-state black hole\nbinaries (e.g., Tanaka & Lewin 1995; McClintock & Remillard 2003), it has been pointed out\ntheoretically that the standard disk can be stable only over a limited range of \u1e40 . Actually,\na series of new solutions to the accretion flow have been discovered, including a slim disk\nsolution, which takes advective cooling into account (Abramowicz et al. 1988; Watarai et\nal. 2000). In addition, a \"very high state\" has been observationally found as a derivative\nstate from the soft state (Miyamoto et al. 1991; van der Klis 1994). Characterized by an\nenhanced hard component and significant variations in both Tin and rin , the very high state\nis regarded as a possible violation of the simple-minded standard-disk picture.\nA clue to this problem has been recently given by Kubota, Makishima, & Ebisawa\n(2001; hereafter Paper I) from an analysis of the multiple RXTE/PCA data of the black\nhole transient with superluminal jet, GRO J1655 \u2212 40. While the source behavior was\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\ndescribed adequately by the standard-disk picture over some period (called standard regime)\nof the entire PCA data span, the other period was characterized by the previously suggested\ndeviation from such a standard behavior (called anomalous regime). The enhanced hard\nX-ray spectrum in the anomalous regime has been interpreted successfully as a result of\nsignificant inverse Compton scattering of the disk photons by some high energy electrons.\nThe inner radius of the underlying optically thick disk has been found to be kept constant,\nwhen the effect of the Comptonization is taken into account. This result has been reinforced\nby Kobayashi et al. (2003).\nIn order to reinforce the view obtained from GRO J1655 \u2212 40, and to deepen our\nunderstanding of the physics of accretion under high values of \u1e40 , the RXTE data of the Xray transient XTE J1550\u2212564 is analyzed in this paper. This transient source was discovered\non 1998 September 7 by RXTE/ASM and CGRO/BATSE (Wilson et al. 1998, Smith 1998),\nand now confirmed as a superluminal jet source (Hannikainen et al. 2001). Figure 1 shows\na lightcurve of this source, obtained with the RXTE/ASM. As indicated with down-arrows\nin this figure, this outburst was continuously monitored by the RXTE pointing observations\nthrough 1999 May 20. Optical observations have established that the system consists of a\nlate type sub giant (G8IV to K4III) and a black hole, the latter having a dynamical mass\nof MX = 8.4\u201311.2 M\u2299 (Orosz et al. 2002). The binary inclination angle and the distance to\nthe source are estimated to be i = 67\u25e6 \u201375\u25e6 and D = 2.8\u20137.6 kpc, respectively. In this paper,\ni = 70\u25e6 is used as a crude estimate, and its distance is denoted as D = D5 * 5 kpc.\nIn \u00a72, the observation and data reduction are briefly described. In \u00a73, the PCA spectra\nare analyzed using the canonical MCD plus power-law model, leading to the identification\nof three characteristic regimes; standard regime, anomalous regime, and apparently standard\nregime, in the increasing order of the luminosity. It is confirmed in \u00a74 that the spectra in\nthe anomalous regime can be well explained by the strong inverse Compton scattering, as\nfound in Paper I. In \u00a75, the apparently standard regime spectra are characterized in terms\nof the radial temperature gradient of the optically-thick disk, with a conclusion that a slim\ndisk is probably realized.\n\n2.\n\nObservation and data reduction\n\nAs indicated with down-arrows in Fig. 1, the entire outburst was covered by 184 pointing observations with RXTE; the obtained data was analyzed in a standard way by Sobczak\net al. (2000). By analyzing the outburst rise phase (\u223c40 days in Fig .1) covered by 14\npointing observations, Wilson & Done (2001) reported that this source experienced a significant spectral evolution. Figure 1 in their paper shows that the power-law photon index\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\ndescribing the PCA spectra below \u223c 20 keV switched from 1.4\u20131.7 to 2\u20133, which are typical\nof the low/hard state (e.g., Tanaka 1997), and the high/soft or very high state (e.g., Grove\net al. 1998), respectively. Meanwhile, the 20\u2013100 keV portion of the spectrum maintained a\nconvex shape. Therefore, the source is inferred to have made a spectral transition from the\nlow/hard state into the very high state (Wilson & Done 2001), or into the anomalous regime\ndefined in Paper I, rather than into the canonical high/soft state wherein the spectrum above\n20 keV would not exhibit any cutoff.\nThese published results indicate that the spectra acquired during the first \u223c 40 days\nof the outburst is possibly related to development of the optically thick accretion disk; in\nresponse to a sudden increase in \u1e40 , an optically thick accretion disk developed inward and\nreached the last stable orbit. Also the data after day 225 (1999 April 20) shows characteristics\nof the low/hard state. Therefore, the present paper focuses on the data taken from 128 PCA\npointing observations between day 43 (1998 October 20) and 224 (1999 April 19), which are\nthought to represent relatively steady states with high \u1e40 . For the systematic analyses of\nall the data set, the HEXTE data is not analyzed here because of poor statistics in some\npointings.\nFollowing the standard procedure for bright sources, good PCA data was selected and\nprocessed. The data was excluded when the target elevation angle was less than 10\u25e6 above the\nEarth's Limb, or when the actual pointing direction was more than 1\u2032.2 away from the pointed\ndirection. In particular, the data was discarded if it was acquired within 30 minutes after the\nspacecraft passage through South Atlantic Anomaly. The selected data from the individual\nproportional counter units was co-added and used for spectral analyses. The standard dead\ntime correction procedure was applied to the data. The PCA background was estimated\nfor each observation, using the software package pcabackest (version 2.1e), supplied by the\nRXTE Guest Observer's Facility at NASA/GSFC. Sometimes, the use of pcabackest resulted\nin an overestimate of the PCA background up to \u223c 10%. Such a systematic over-estimate\nwas corrected in the same way as in Paper I. That is, the on-source spectra were compared\nto the predicted model background spectra in the hardest energy band (>80 keV), where\nthe signal flux is usually negligible. If necessary, the normalization factor of the background\nspectrum was changed. The PCA response matrix was made for each observation by utilizing\nthe software package pcarsp (version 7.10). In order to take into account the calibration\nuncertainties, 1% systematic errors are added to the data. Over the 20\u201335 keV range, the\nsystematic errors are increased to 10%, to cope with the response uncertainties associated\nwith the Xe-K edge at \u223c 30 keV. Although this could be an overestimate, the 20\u201335 keV\ndata is utilized only in \u00a74, and the results remain essentially unchanged even if it is reduced\nto 2 %.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n3.\n3.1.\n\nStandard modeling of the PCA spectra\nCharacterization of the observed spectra\n\nThe 3\u201320 keV PCA spectra of XTE J1550\u2212564 were analyzed by employing the canonical MCD plus power-law model. The two constituent continuum components were subjected\nto common photoelectric absorption, with the column fixed at NH = 1 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 , which is\nreasonable for the source distance of 5 kpc and its Galactic position of (l, b) = (325\u25e6.9, \u22121\u25e6.83).\nThe following results are not affected by changing the value of NH to 5 \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122 . The\ndata requires additionally an absorption edge to the power-law component around 7\u20139 keV\nin terms of a smeared edge model (Ebisawa et al. 1994) and a narrow Gaussian line around\n6.5\u20136.7 keV for the Fe-K line.\nFigure 2 shows time histories of the best-fit model parameters, including the disk\nbolometric luminosity Ldisk (Mitsuda et al. 1984; Makishima et al. 1986), the 1\u2013100\nkeV power-law luminosity Lpow calculated assuming an isotropic emission and their sum,\nLtot \u2261 Ldisk + Lpow . Along the time history, the entire observational span can be divided into\nthe following eight periods (Periods 1\u20138 denoted in Fig. 2a) of relatively distinct properties,\nby mainly referring to the behavior of Lpow and Ldisk .\n\u2022 Periods 1 and 7 are characterized by dominance of Lpow and significant reductions in rin .\n\u2022 In Periods 2 and 8, Ltot decreases keeping Lpow rather low, while rin remains rather large\nand constant.\n\u2022 In Period 3, Ldisk gradually increases, but Lpow remains negligible. The power-law component is too weak to constrain its photon index \u0393. It is therefore fixed at \u0393 = 2.0.\n\u2022 In Periods 4 and 5, Lpow is negligible (hence \u0393 being still fixed at 2.0), while Ltot saturates\nat \u223c 6 \u00d7 1038 * D5 2 erg s\u22121 ; this is about \u223c 40 * D5 2 % of the Eddington limit, LE , for\na black hole of 10 M\u2299 .\n\u2022 Period 6 may be intermediate between Periods 5 and 7.\nTypical spectra representing these periods are shown in Fig. 3, and their best-fit parameters\nare given in Table 1. The fits are acceptable for the data in Periods 1, 2, and 6\u20138, but\nsometimes unacceptable in Periods 3\u20135 (Fig. 2e). This problem is considered again in \u00a75.\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n3.2.\n\nObserved three spectral regimes\n\nTo examine each Period for the validity of the standard picture, Fig. 4 shows several\nscatter plots between the spectral parameters. The data points of Periods 2, 3, and 8\nare thus confirmed to satisfy the standard picture, because rin is therein kept constant at\n\u223c 60 * D5 km while Tin changes significantly, \u223c 0.5\u20131 keV (Fig. 2, Fig. 4a). By taking into\naccount a correction factor for the boundary condition of \u03be = 0.412 (Kubota et al. 1998)\nand a color hardening factor of \u03ba = 1.7 (Shimura & Takahara 1997), the true inner radius\nis estimated as Rin = rin * \u03be * \u03ba2 \u223c 71 * D5 km. This value seems to be slightly smaller than\n6Rg for a 10 M\u2299 black hole, 90 km, though the source distance is not well constrained.\nThe data points in Period 1 and 7 clearly violate the standard picture. Even though\nthe fits are acceptable (Fig. 2e), rin is observed to change significantly over 30\u201350*D5 km\n(Fig. 2c), and Tin shows strong positive deviation from their long-term trend (Fig. 2b). In\nthese Periods, the hard component dominates the MCD component (Fig. 2a), and values of\n\u0393 are largest among these eight Periods (Fig. 2b). All these properties make Periods 1 and\n7 reminiscent of the anomalous regime of GRO J1655 \u2212 40 (Paper I).\nThe classification of Period 4\u20136 is somewhat ambiguous. The hard emission is negligible\n(Fig. 2a), and the spectral shape is similar to those in the standard regime (Fig. 3). However,\nas is clear from Fig. 2a, the data suffers from a strong saturation in Ldisk . In addition, a slight\nincrease of Tin under the saturation in Ldisk gives rise to a slight decrease in rin (Fig. 4a).\nIn this sense, Periods 4\u20136 are called the apparently standard regime in this paper. Thus,\nXTE J1550 \u2212 564 exhibits three characteristic spectral regimes, the standard (Periods 2, 3,\n8), apparently standard (4, 5, 6), and anomalous (1, 7) regimes.\nThe Ldisk -Lpow diagram, presented in Fig. 4c, can be used to understand the spectral\nevolution. The entire span of this source is found to show a clockwise loop; starting from a\nhighest-Lpow point (Period 1; anomalous regime), the source moves to the left along a lowLdisk branch (Period 2; standard regime), then increases in Ldisk with Lpow kept low (Period\n3; standard regime), and reaches a ceiling at Ldisk , \u223c 6 \u00d7 1038 * D5 2 erg s\u22121 . It then moves to\nthe right (Periods 4, 5 and 6; apparently standard regime). Finally, in Period 7 (anomalous\nregime), it returns to nearly the same position as Period 1, with Period 8 (standard regime)\nbeing a simple repetition of Period 2. Thus, the source fortunately exhibited a complete one\ncycle.\nFigure 5a shows a Ldisk -Tin diagram, which is useful to examine the validity of the\nstandard picture against luminosity. A simple relation of Ldisk \u221d Tin 4 means the constancy\nof rin (see also Fig 4a), and hence the goodness of the standard picture. In this diagram, the\ndata points in the standard regime indeed satisfy this relation, while those in the anomalous\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nregime deviate significantly. The data points in the apparently standard regime, clustered at\nthe uppermost end of the diagram, deviate weakly from the standard Ldisk \u221d Tin 4 relation,\nexhibiting a flatter dependence of Ldisk on Tin as Ldisk \u221d Tin 2 .\nIt is useful to note here that the overall spectral shape of the MCD model well describes\nemission from a standard disk, even though it ignores the inner boundary condition of the\ndisk. As long as the PCA spectra of Tin = 0.5\u20132 keV are concerned, the values of Tin and\nrin (with the corrections mentioned before) agree with 4\u20135 % with those obtained by a more\naccurate model, e.g., a diskpn model (Gierli\u0144ski et al. 1999; Gierli\u0144ski & Done 2003) in\nxspec. Therefore, the characteristics shown in Fig. 4\u20135, are not due to incompleteness of the\nMCD model but mean that the anomalous regime and the apparently standard regime are\nintrinsically different from the standard regime.\n\n4. Reanalyses of the anomalous regime data\n\u2013 confirmation of the strong inverse Compton scattering \u2013\nNow that Period 1 and 7 have been inferred to be the anomalous regime, these data can\nbe reanalyzed employing the concept of the strong disk Comptonization which successfully\nexplains the anomalous regime of GRO J1655 \u2212 40 (Paper I). In the case of GRO J1655 \u2212 40,\nthe hard component in the anomalous regime has been found to be different in behavior from\nthe power-law tail of the standard regime, in several points, including negative correlation\nbetween Lpow and Ldisk , and systematically higher values of \u0393. It is hence argued in Paper I\nthat in the anomalous regime the spectrum is contributed significantly by a third spectral\ncomponent, which is harder than the MCD emission but softer than the power-law tail in\nthe standard regime. The strong anti-correlation between Lpow and Ldisk has been taken\nfor evidence that this third component strongly and negatively correlates with the MCD\ncomponent. It is therefore natural to assume that a fraction of the photons from the optically\nthick accretion disk are converted into the third spectral component, most probably through\ninverse Compton scattering by high energy electrons which may reside somewhere around\nthe disk.\nFollowing Paper I, the PCA spectra in the anomalous regime of XTE J1550 \u2212 564\nare re-fitted with a three-component model, obtained by adding a Comptonized component\nto the original two component model. In this paper, a thermal Comptonization model\n(thcomp; Zycki, Done, & Smith 1999 ) is utilized to reproduce the Comptonized component,\ninstead of the Comptonized blackbody model (compbb; Nishimura, Mitsuda, & Itoh 1986)\nwhich was used in Paper I. The thcomp model is based on a solution of the Kompaneets\nequation (Lightman & Zdziarski 1987). It well describes thermal cutoff around the electron\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\ntemperature of the plasma, Te , and allows the MCD model to be used as a seed photon\nspectrum. In contrast, the compbb model is useable only energies below kTe , and it assumes\na single temperature black body emission as a seed photon spectrum. The thcomp model\nhas actually improved the fit goodness compared to the compbb model because of difference\nin the seed photon spectra. The main results of the present paper are however independent\nof such modelings, and same results were obtained by using the compbb model. In this\nsubsection, the 3\u201350 keV data is used to better constrain the wide-band spectral shape.\nFor the spectral fitting, many of the model parameters were fixed to default values\nafter Paper I. Namely, the maximum color temperature of the seed photons was tied to Tin ,\nto reproduce the situation whereby a part of the original MCD photons are up-scattered.\nFurthermore, Te was fixed at a representative value of 20 keV since it could not be constrained\nand is consistent with that obtained during the first 14 observations by Wilson & Done\n(2001). Neither a reflection component nor relativistic smearing was added to the model.\nHence the free parameters of the thcomp model are two; thcomp photon index \u0393thc which\nexpresses the spectral shape below kTe , and its normalization. Moreover, a value of \u0393 of the\noriginal power-law component was fixed at 2.0. As a result, the additional number of the\nfree parameters for spectral fittings is reduced to only one.\nFigure 6 shows the same anomalous-regime spectrum as presented in Fig. 3a, but fitted\nwith the three-component model over the expanded energy range. A solid line represents\nthe additional thcomp component. The fit is acceptable, and the result implies that the\ndominant hard spectral component is mostly produced by the strong disk Comptonization.\nThe re-estimated values of Tin for all the data in the anomalous regime are plotted again in\nFig. 2b with open triangles. By considering the disk Comptonization, the highly deviated\ndata points in terms of Tin have thus settled back to a smooth long-term trend as was\nalready found in GRO J1655 \u2212 40 (Paper I). The luminosity is also re-estimated in Fig. 5b\nas Ldisk + Lthc , where Lthc is the estimated 0.01\u2013100 keV thcomp luminosity, assuming an\nisotropic emission. Thus, Ldisk + Lthc plotted against the revised Tin approximately recovers\nthe standard Ldisk \u221d Tin 4 relation for optically-thick accretion disks.\nThe value of rin is difficult to be estimated precisely under the strong Comptonization,\nbecause of uncertainties of both geometry and optical depth, \u03c4es , of the cloud. In the present\npaper, it is approximately calculated by referring to observed photon flux and a re-estimated\nvalue of Tin , on an assumption that few photons are scattered back into the optically thick\ndisk and hence the number of the observed photons is conserved through inverse Compton\nscatterings. Details of this procedure are described in Appendix-A. The re-estimated values\nof rin , plotted in Fig. 2c with open triangles, now appear to remain almost stable at \u223c\n60 * D5 km. Consequently, the optically thick accretion disk can also be considered to remain\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nrelatively stable, even when a significant fraction of the MCD photons are Comptonized.\nTherefore, the picture of disk Comptonization is reconfirmed in the anomalous regime, as\nsuggested in GRO J1655 \u2212 40 (Paper I; Kobayashi et al. 2003).\nTable 2 summarizes the best-fit parameters associated with the exemplified spectra in\nthe anomalous regime. The value of \u0393thc \u223c 2.8 implies a y-parameter of \u223c 0.2, or \u03c4es \u223c 1.8\ncalculated via a following formula (e.g., Sunyaev & Titarchuk 1980) assuming Te = 20 keV;\ns\n3\n\u03c4es = 2.25 +\n\u2212 1.5 .\n(1)\n(Te /511keV) * {(\u0393thc + 0.5)2 \u2212 2.25}\nThe derived parameters are similar to those of GRO J1655 \u2212 40. The smallness of y and \u03c4es\nis consistent with the comparatively small fraction of Lthc relative to Ldisk + Lthc , typically\n< 0.5. It is also consistent with the assumption made in re-evaluating rin in Appendix-A\nand Fig. 5b, that the mean number of scattering is not too large and the fractional energy\nchange is small.\nFrom these results, the anomalous behavior of XTE J1550 \u2212 564 observed in Periods\n1 and 7 can be identified with that of GRO J1655 \u2212 40 in the anomalous regime: the\noptically-thick standard accretion disk is present, but the Comptonization converts a significant fraction of its emission into the hard component.\n\n5.\n\nReanalyses of the apparently standard regime data\n5.1.\n\nProperties of the apparently standard regime\n\nAs shown in \u00a73, the apparently standard regime corresponds to the most luminous phase\nof the outburst, and the data in this regime occupies the upper-right region of the Ldisk -Tin\ndiagram (Fig. 5b). In this regime, Tin gradually changed keeping Ldisk almost constant at\n6 \u00d7 1038 * D5 2 erg s\u22121 (\u223c 0.4 LE ). As a result, the data points deviate from the standard\nLdisk \u221d Tin 4 relation, as Ldisk \u221d Tin 2 . The obtained values of rin are not constant but\nbecome smaller than those in the standard regime, exhibiting a weak correlation with Tin as\nrin \u221d Tin \u22121 . Figure 4a clearly shows this behavior.\nAs seen in Fig. 3, the spectra in the apparently standard regime show a dominant soft\ncomponent accompanied by a very weak hard tail. Although these properties are similar to\nthat of the standard soft state, the apparently standard regime is something different from\nthe standard regime because of the inconstancy of rin (or moderate saturation of Ldisk ), and\nthe absence of the Fe-K line feature that is usually found in the standard regime. Moreover,\nthe canonical spectral model often failed to give acceptable fits to the data (Fig. 2e). As are\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nclearly seen in the residuals of Fig. 3d-e, the discrepancy between the data and the best-fit\ncanonical model appears as a low-energy excess and a spectral hump around 13 keV. This\ncould be a result of fixing \u0393 of the hard tail component at 2.0; accordingly, the fits were\nrepeated by leaving \u0393 free to vary. Then, the fits became acceptable, but they required\nso large values of \u0393 (see Fig. 2d, Table 1), that the spectrum below \u223c 5 keV is mostly\naccounted for by the power-law component rather than the MCD component; the observed\nlow-energy excess is filled up artificially by the steep power-law. Such a fit could be physically\ninappropriate.\nThe above results on the apparently standard regime suggest a subtle difference in the\naccretion disk configuration from the standard disk, in such a way that the softest end of the\nobserved spectrum is more enhanced than is described by the MCD model. Such a change, in\nturn, may arise if, e.g., the radiative efficiency of the inner disk region becomes reduced and\nthe radial temperature gradient flattens. In order to quantify this idea, in \u00a75.2 a p-free disk\nmodel is constructed as a mathematically generalized function of the MCD model. The data\nin the apparently standard regime is then examined in \u00a75.3 by utilizing this model function.\n\n5.2.\n\nFormalism of the p-free disk model\n\nThe concept of the standard accretion disk assumes that the energy released by accretion\nis half stored in the Keplerian kinetic energy, and half radiated away as local blackbody\nemission. As a result, the spectrum of the standard disk can be described as a geometricallyweighted sum of multi-temperature blackbody components of which the local temperature\ndepends as T (r) \u221d r \u22123/4 on the distance, r, from the central black hole. Therefore, any\ndeparture of the physical condition assumed by the standard disk picture will make the\nradial temperature gradient deviate from the canonical value of \u22123/4. Such a deviation will\nin turn cause a slight deformation of the radially-integrated X-ray spectra that are observed.\nIn order to quantify this idea, the MCD model is generalized as seen below, after initial\nattempts by Mineshige et al. (1994, for GS 1124 \u2212 68) and Hirano et al. (1995, for Cyg X-2).\nThe main assumptions of the model developed here are that a disk local temperature\nis described by T (r) = Tin * (r/rin)\u2212p , and that the disk locally emits a blackbody spectrum.\nHere, p is a dimension-less positive parameter introduced to generalize the MCD formalism,\nwith p = 3/4 implying the MCD model. The spectrum from this model function can be\nwritten as\n\u0012 \u0013\u2212 p2 \u22121\n2 Z Tin\n2\u03c0 cos i * rin\nT\ndT\nfp (E) =\n,\n(2)\nB(E, T )\n2\np*d\nTin\nTin\nTout\nwith B(E, T ) being a blackbody spectrum of temperature T . For convenience, hereafter\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nthis mathematical model function is called p-free disk model. As p decreases, the spectrum\nbecomes softer than the MCD spectrum of the same Tin , because the radiation from outer\nparts of the accretion disk is emphasized as seen in equation (2).\n\n5.3.\n\nSpectral fitting with the p-free disk model\n\nThe PCA spectra of Periods 3\u20135 (one segment of standard regime and two of apparently\nstandard regime) have been re-fitted by replacing the MCD model component with the pfree disk model. Although an accurate determination of p is difficult when the power-law\ncomponent is strong, the PCA spectra in Period 3\u20135 are fortunately free from this obstacle.\nThe condition of spectral fitting is otherwise the same as in \u00a73. That is, the absorption\ncolumn NH and \u0393 of the power-law component are fixed at 1\u00d71022 cm\u22122 and 2.0, respectively.\nThe Gaussian line was not included.\nThe time histories of the obtained p-free disk model parameters are given in Fig. 7. In\nPeriod 4 and 5 (apparently standard regime), the fit goodness has been significantly improved\nby allowing p free. Figure 8 shows the same apparently standard regime spectrum originally\npresented in Fig. 2e, fitted this time with the p-free disk model, and Table 3 shows the\nexamples of the p-free model parameters.\nIn Fig. 9, the best fit values of p are plotted against Tin ; here, instead of the values of Tin\nobtained by the p-free disk model, those by the MCD model are employed, in order to avoid\nany systematic coupling between p and Tin . The dependence of p on Tin thus changes at \u223c1\nkeV. As a function of Tin , p increases up to \u223c 1 keV (Period 3, the standard regime), beyond\nwhich it decreases abruptly and the correlation turns negative (Period 4\u20135, the apparently\nstandard regime). To examine these results for various systematic effects, the p-free disk fits\nhave been extensively repeated by changing the fitting conditions; fixing NH to 5 \u00d71021 cm\u22122\ninstead of 1 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 , fixing \u0393 to 2.2 instead of 2.0, including a Gaussian line of which\nthe central energy is constrained to 6.2\u20136.9 keV. These different conditions slightly affected\nthe absolute values of p, but did not affect the characteristic p vs. Tin behavior of Fig. 9a.\nThus, the value of p has been found to deviate from 3/4 as the source enters deep into\nthe apparently standard regime. However, a still larger excursion of p is observed during the\nstandard regime, where p = 3/4 should be obtained. Therefore, the changes of p in Fig. 9\ncould partially or entirely be due to some artifacts, and p could deviate from 3/4, even if the\nstandard accretion disk is realized. This could actually happens, because the MCD model is\na mere approximation of the exact standard-disk solution; the actual temperature gradient\nof a standard accretion disk must be flatter than \u22123/4 near the innermost disk edge, where\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nthe temperature will approach zero. As Tin decreases, the limited PCA band pass will sample\npreferentially the emission from inner disk regions, thus making p different from 3/4.\nIn order to address the above issue, a theoretical approach was first attempted. That\nis, a number of 3\u201320 keV PCA spectra were simulated, using two theoretical model spectra\nin the xspec which are known to be more accurate than the MCD model. One is the diskpn\nmodel, which is based on the Shakura-Sunyaev solution in a pseudo-Newtonian potential; it\nproperly takes the inner boundary condition into account. The other is so-called a GRAD\nmodel (Hanawa 1989; Ebisawa, Mitsuda, & Hanawa 1991), which considers full general\nrelativistic effects for a Schwarzshild metric. Then, the simulated spectra were fitted with\nthe p-free disk model. As a result, both diskpn and GRAD models gave p = 0.72\u20130.75\nas long as Tin is in the range 1.2\u20131.5 keV. Furthermore, p was found to change (over 0.5\u2013\n1.0) for lower input disk temperature of Tin = 0.8\u20131.5 keV. However, the p-Tin relation\nturned out to be quite different between the two input models, and to depend significantly\non the inclination angle when the GRAD model is used. In addition to these theoretical\ncomplications, neither the diskpn model nor the GRAD model can be considered accurate\nyet, since they (as well as the MCD model) neglect possible spectral deviation from a pure\nlocal blackbody. Accordingly, this approach has been concluded unrealistic.\nIn this paper, instead, the PCA-determined values of p for a standard disk has been\ncalibrated empirically, by using actual spectral data of a prototypical black hole binary,\nLMC X-3, in the standard regime. This black hole binary perfectly satisfies the standard\npicture up to \u223c LE for a black hole of 5\u20137.2 M\u2299 (Paper I, Wilms et al. 2001), and its system\ninclination angle, 65\u25e6 \u201369\u25e6 , is similar to that of XTE J1550 \u2212 564. The p-free disk model\nwas applied to the PCA spectra of LMC X-3 obtained by 128 pointed RXTE observations\nfrom 1996 February to 1999 January (Kubota 2001). The best fit values of p from LMC X3 are plotted against Tin in Fig. 9b. As expected, a positive correlation between p and\nTin artificially appears even for this prototypical \"standard-disk\" object. Therefore, the\nbehavior of XTE J1550 \u2212 564 (in Fig. 9a) for Tin \u2264 1keV (Period 3, the standard regime) can\nbe understood as an artifact. In contrast, the behavior of XTE J1550 \u2212 564 for Tin \u2265 1 keV\nis clearly distinct from that of LMC X-3. The conclusion is that the temperature gradient\nof XTE J1550 \u2212 564 in Period 4 and 5 becomes intrinsically smaller than in the standard\nregime, and hence the accretion disk in the apparently standard regime in reality deviates\nfrom the standard picture.\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\n6.\n6.1.\n\nDiscussion\n\nOverall picture from the observation\n\nThrough the detailed analysis of the PCA data of XTE J1550 \u2212 564, the three spectral\nregimes have been identified. Their relation on the Ldisk -Tin plane is illustrated schematically\nin Fig. 10, while their properties can be summarized as follows.\n1. When Ldisk is well below a certain critical upper-limit luminosity, Lc \u223c 6 \u00d7 1038 *\nD5 2 erg s\u22121 (\u223c 0.4 * D5 2 LE ), the spectral behavior can be explained by the standarddisk picture. This is the standard regime.\n2. When Ldisk hits Lc , it is moderately saturated as Ldisk \u221d Tin 2 , and hence rin shows\na weak correlation to Tin as rin \u221d Tin \u22121 . Although the spectrum, consisting of a\ndominant soft component and a weak hard tail, resembles that in the standard regime,\nthe radial temperature gradient in the disk (represented by p) becomes flatter than in\nthe standard disk. This is the apparently standard regime (\u00a75).\n3. At an intermediate case (Ldisk \u223c Lc ), the spectral hard component dominates, and\nthe apparent inner-disk radius is no longer constant. This is the anomalous regime\n(\u00a74). These effects can be explained by a sudden increase of the disk Comptonization,\nwhile the underlying disk itself remains in the standard state and rin is kept constant.\n4. The source evolves from the standard to apparently standard regimes, then to the\nanomalous regime, and returns again to the standard regime.\nThe anomalous regime is naturally identified with that found in GRO J1655 \u2212 40, and the\nscenario of Comptonization suggested in Paper I successfully applies to XTE J1550 \u2212 564\nas well. It has been confirmed that the violent variation in rin in the anomalous regime is\napparently caused by strong disk Comptonization, with the underlying optically thick disk\nextending down to the last stable orbit like in the standard regime. The apparently standard\nregime is possibly the same as Period 1 of GRO J1655 \u2212 40. Because intensity variation\nin Period 1 of the source was small, Paper I did not discuss the source behavior in that\nperiod. However, GRO J1655 \u2212 40 resides in this period in the upper right corner on the\nLdisk -Tin plane (see Paper I), and its spectra consist of a dominant disk component and a\nvery weak hard tail. These properties are basically the same as those of XTE J1550 \u2212 564\nin the apparently standard regime.\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\n6.2.\n\nComparison with theoretical predictions\n\nAs is well known, theoretical solutions to the steady-state accretion flow form an Sshaped locus on the plane of \u1e40 vs. the surface density of the disk (e.g., Abramowicz et\nal. 1988, Chen & Taam 1993, Kato, Fukue, & Mineshige 1998). The locus involves to\nthermally stable branches; the standard Shakura-Sunyaev accretion disk solution, and the\nslim-disk solution, realized when \u1e40 is relatively low and very high, respectively. Evidently,\nthe standard regime can be identified with the standard Shakura-Sunyaev solution.\nThe slim disk solution takes into account the effect of the advection, in addition to the\nviscous heating and the radiative cooling. This effect becomes important when \u1e40 is high\nand hence the luminosity is close to LE . Under this condition, any increase in \u1e40 would be\nbalanced by an increase in the advective transport, accompanied by little increase in Ldisk ;\nthis agrees with the observed mild saturation in Ldisk observed in the apparently standard\nregime. Watarai et al. (2000) simulated many slim disk spectra, fitted them with the MCD\nmodel, and derived an empirical relation between rin and the apparent Tin as rin \u221d Tin \u22121 (or\nLdisk \u221d Tin 2 ). This is exactly what has been observed in Fig. 5a. Furthermore, Watarai et\nal. (2000) showed that the temperature gradient becomes flatter as the advective cooling\nbecomes important because of a progressive suppression of disk emissivity. In the extreme\ncase, p can reduce to 0.5. Thus, the overall source behavior in the apparently standard regime\nagrees very well with the prediction by the slim disk model. Of course, this state assignment\nis still tentative, because the slim disk solution still neglects important effects such as general\nrelativity, magnetic field, and photon trapping (Ohsuga et al. 2002). Other solutions would\nhave to be considered as well.\nIn addition to the two stable branchs, a thermally and secularly unstable branch is\nknown to exist between them. This branch is recognized as a negative slope on the Sshape sequence. By comparing the obtained Ldisk -Tin diagram to the S-shape sequence, the\nanomalous regime may have some relation to the unstable branch of the sequence. In other\nwords, the instability of the standard disk may cause the anomalous regime. Interestingly,\nthe quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) are observed preferentially in the anomalous regime,\nin GRO J1655 \u2212 40 (Remillard et al. 1999) and XTE J1550 \u2212 564 (Remillard et al. 2002).\nTherefore, the QPO is likely to relate to the existence of the Compton cloud.\nThe observed three distinctive regimes are likely to reflect the change of the accretion\ndisk structure from the standard accretion disk to other solutions, as the radiative cooling\nbecomes progressively inefficient. These results hence provide, at least potentially, one of\nthe first observational accounts of the long predicted S-shaped sequence.\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nThe authors would like to thank Hajime Inoue, Shin Mineshige and Chris Done, for\ntheir valuable comments.

Here, Tin refers to the disk temperature obtained by\nconsidering the inverse Compton scattering as is done in \u00a7 4. The first parentheses is just the\nsame as the normalization factor of the MCD model in the xspec. This formula is based on\nan assumption that there are few photons which are injected again into the optically thick\ncool disk (i.e., optical depth of the cloud is not very large). It can be derived through the\nfollowing steps.\n\n1. Via flux command of the xspec, 0.0165 photons s\u22121 cm\u22122 in the range of 0.01\u2013100 keV\nis obtained for the MCD spectrum of which Tin and normalization are 1 keV and 1,\nrespectively.\n2. According to the Stefan-Boltzmann's law, photon flux from the original optically thick\n2\ndisk emission is in proportion to rin\n* Tin3 .\np\n3. Isotropic emission is assumed for Comptonized photons, and thus Fthc\nis multiplied by\n2 cos i.\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nREFERENCES\nAbramowicz, M.
