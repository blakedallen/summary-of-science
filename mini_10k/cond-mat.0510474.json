Brownian motion of a rotational ellipsoid in a viscous\nsolvent is described in terms of a partial differential equation coupling rotational and translational diffusion (see also Ref. 4). The central quantity is \u03c1(r, u, t; r\u2032 , u\u2032 , 0), the probability\nto find a molecule with center of mass (CMS) position r and orientation u at time t, given\nthat its CMS position is r\u2032 and its orientation is u\u2032 at time t = 0. Its dynamical evolution\nis governed by the following translational-rotational diffusion equation, first introduced by\nPerrin2,3 :\nh\n\u0001i\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\u2202t \u03c1(r, u, t; r , u , 0) = \u2212DR L\u0302 + Dk (\u2207r * u) + D\u22a5 \u2207r \u2212 (\u2207r * u) \u03c1(r, u, t; r\u2032 , u\u2032 , 0). (1)\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nHere u denotes the orientation of the symmetry axis of the molecule. The operator L\u03022 is\nthe familiar angular momentum operator. It describes rotational diffusion, DR being the\n\nrotational diffusion constant. The usual Laplacian has been decomposed into directions parallel and perpendicular to the particle orientation, with parallel and perpendicular diffusion\nconstants Dk and D\u22a5 respectively.\nTransport coefficients may be calculated using the Kirkwood-Riseman theory5 for rod-like\nmolecules in solution. Broersma6 computes the rotational and isotropic translational diffusion coefficients approximately for long cylinders with no stick boundary conditions. Rods\nwith capped hemispheres at the ends have also been considered7,8 . Alternatively the rods\nare composed of spherical hydrodynamic subunits9,10,11 with each sphere interacting with\nthe other spheres via hydrodynamic interactions. The resulting transport coefficients obey\nthe Stokes-Einstein relation, i.e. both the rotational and the translational diffusion constant\nare inversely proportional to the solvent viscosity. Transport properties of nonspherical\nmolecules have also been computed using kinetic theory12,13,14,15 .\nIn polymer physics, the transport behavior of rod-like macromolecules has been investigated where anisotropic translational diffusion and the coupling of rotational and translational diffusion is most pronounced. The coupling of rotational and translational diffusion\ncan be detected experimentally by depolarized light scattering. Dynamic light scattering\nfrom cylindrically symmetric rigid particles has been discussed by Aragon and Pecora16,17,18 .\nIf only autocorrelations are included, the intensity of scattered light is proportional to the\n2\n\n\fintermediate scattering function\nN\n1 X (i)\ni\ni\nS(k, t) =\nh\u03b1 (0)\u03b1(i) (t)eik(r (t)\u2212r (0)) i\nN i=1\n\nwith \u03b1(i) =\n\n3\nX\n\n(i) fin\nninc\n\u03bd \u03b1\u03bd\u03bc n\u03bc .\n\n\u03bd,\u03bc=1\n(i)\n\nHere k is the wave vector and \u03b1\u03bd\u03bc is the polarizability tensor of particle i and ninc (nfin )\ndenotes the polarization vector of the incident (scattered) light. Aragon and Pecora have\nsolved the Perrin equation, allowing for a comparison of the theoretical predictions of the\nPerrin equation and the measured intensities. If the polarization of the incident and scattered\nlight are orthogonal, then the scattering intensity is proportional to\nN\n1 X\ni\ni\nh(ui (0) * ui (t))2 eik(r (t)\u2212r (0)) i\nS(k, t) \u223c\nN i=1\n\n(2)\n\nIf the average over orientation and position is factorized, the intermediate scattering function\ndecay with a rate \u0393 = 6DR +Diso k 2 . The factorizing assumption, however, is valid only if the\nrespective decay rates for orientational und positional degrees of freedom differ sufficiently.\nThis is usually the case as long as DR \u226b Diso k 2 , which is guaranteed for small wave vectors.\nHence translational and rotational diffusion coefficients can and have been obtained from\npolarized light scattering experiments19,20,21 , however the experiments are difficult due to\nlow intensities of the scattered light22 . Since rotational and lateral motions of a rod-like\nmolecule are usually studied in light scattering experiments for kL \u2265 1, where L is the rod\n\nlength22 , the factorizing assumption is bound to break down and coupling of translational\nand rotational diffusion will become important.\n\nEven though the Perrin equation was originally formulated for the Brownian motion of\na rodlike macromolecule in solution, it is usually thought to be applicable to the motion of\na tagged rod in a fluid of otherwise identical rods. These systems have been simulated in\nthe limit that the diameter of the rods goes to zero. Frenkel and Maguire23 suggested an\nalgorithm for the dynamics of hard needles and furthermore computed the autocorrelation\nof the linear velocity and the angular velocity in the Enskog approximation. The latter\nbreaks down when the density \u03c10 is sufficiently high, such that the tagged rod cannot rotate\nunless other rods move out of the way. This so called semidilute transition density was\nestimated to be24 \u03c10 =\n\nN 3\nL\nV\n\n\u223c 70. Here N denotes the total number of rods of length L\n3\n\n\fconfined to a volume V . For larger densities the rotational diffusion constant DR \u223c \u03c1\u22122\n0 ,\n\nas first suggested by Doi and Edwards with help of a scaling argument25 . They argue that\nrotational diffusion of a rod can be described by a random walk, so that the rotational\ndiffusion constant is given by the product of the jump frequency, \u03bd, and the average step\nsize squared: DR = \u03bd(a/L)2 . In the semidilute regime the jump frequency is \u03bd \u223c Dk /L2\nand the step size is (a/L) \u223c 1/\u03c10 , leading to the above scaling of DR with density. A similar\nscaling argument has been formulated for the transverse diffusion coefficient. The inverse\nof the jump frequency \u03bd can also be interpreted as the disentanglement time, or within the\nreptation model as the time needed for the breakup of the tube, confining the test rod.\nOn time scales of order 1/\u03bd the rod can diffuse in the transverse direction by an amount a,\n26,27\ngiving rise to D\u22a5 \u223c a2 \u03bd \u223c \u03c1\u22122\n0 . Such a scaling has been derived by Szamel and Schweizer\n\nwithin a dynamic mean field theory for self and tracer diffusion. They neglect rotational\nmotion of the rods and close the hierarchy of dynamical distribution functions on the two\nparticle level.\nIn this work, we discuss the microscopic dynamics of a gas of infinitely thin needles as\na minimal model for rod-like macromolecules. An approximate kinetic theory is derived\nwhich allows us to determine the time delayed autocorrelation function of a tagged particle's density with a given orientation u. We derive a hydrodynamic equation for this\nautocorrelation function from the microscopic collisional dynamics and examine the validity\nof the phenomenological Perrin equation in the limit of small wave vectors kL \u226a 1. In fact,\ndifferences with the Perrin theory are found. In particular, meaningful anisotropic diffusion\nconstants Dk and D\u22a5 can only be obtained in the limit of high densities. In contrast to the\nPerrin theory we include the free motion of the particles in the microscopic theory, giving\nrise to ballistic behavior at short times. In addition to smooth needles, we consider rough\nneedles28 , which allow for a change of the relative tangential velocity in a collision. The\nresults, however, are qualitatively the same as for smooth needles.\nThe outline of the paper is as follows. In Sec. II we analyse the solutions of the Perrin\nequation following Aragon and Pecora. In particular we discuss anisotropic diffusion with\nhelp of the mean square displacement parallel and pependicular to the rod's orientation. In\nSec. III we analyse binary collisions of two hard needles and introduce a Pseudo Liouville\noperator for the time evolution of a gas of hard needles. Subsequently (Sec. IV) we apply the\nprojection operator formalism of Mori and Zwanzig to the correlation function of interest,\n4\n\n\fwhich is thereby represented as a continued fraction. The formalism is applied to the density\nof a tagged particle with given orientation, i.e. \u03c1(r, u), in Sec. V. In Sec. V C we describe\nnumerical simulations. The results of a truncation of the continued fraction are presented\nand compared with the simulation results in Sec. VI. We conclude with a discussion and\noutlook in Sec. VII.\n\nII.\n\nANALYSIS OF THE PERRIN EQUATION\n\nIn this section we review the predictions of the Perrin equation, Eq. (1), as discussed in\nRefs. 16,17,18, with particular emphasis on anisotropic diffusion. We do not present any\nnew results, instead we want to familiarize the reader with this classic phenomenological\ntheory. Later on, we will compare this theory with our kinetic theory, which is based on a\nmicroscopic dynamic model.\nThe first step in the solution of the Perrin equation is a Fourier transform with respect\nto the spatial coordinates\n\u2032\n\n\u03c1\u0303(k, u, u ; t) =\n\nZ\n\nd3 r eikr \u03c1(r, u, t; r\u2032, u\u2032 , 0)\n\n(3)\n\nwhere we have assumed spatial homogeneity. The Fourier transformed function is the solution of\n\u2202t \u03c1\u0303(k, u, u\u2032 , t) = [\u2212DR L\u03022 \u2212 k 2 D\u22a5 \u2212 (Dk \u2212 D\u22a5 )(k * u)2 ]\u03c1\u0303(k, u, u\u2032 , t).\n\n(4)\n\nIt is convenient to choose a coordinate frame k = k\u1e91 with k = |k|, so that the unit vector u\nis specified by a polar angle \u03c6 and \u03b7 = k * u/(k).

We define the displacement \u2206r(t) :=\nr0 (t) \u2212 r0 (0) and compute its projection on the initial orientation \u2206rk (t) := \u2206r(t) * u0 (0)\nas well as perpendicular to it \u2206r\u22a5 (t) := \u2206r(t) \u2212 u0 (0)\u2206r(t) * u0 (0).

The asymptotic long time behaviour is again\ndiffusive with, however, an isotropic diffusion constant Diso = (Dk + 2D\u22a5 )/3. The crossover\nis determined by the rotational diffusion constant DR , such that for 6DR t \u226b 1 the initial\norientation has been forgotten and diffusion is completely isotropic.\nThe above discussion already indicates that it might be difficult to detect anisotropic\ndiffusion, since it is not the true asymptotic long time behaviour and, on the other hand,\nwe expect ballistic motion for short times which is not accounted for in the Perrin equation. Hence the anisotropic diffusion on intermediate timescales will be superimposed by a\ncrossover to ballistic motion on short time scales and isotropic diffusion on long time scales.\nOnly if the density is sufficiently high, so that the time for rotation of the molecule is large,\ndo we expect to see a clear separation of the two diffusive regimes.\n6\n\n\fSeveral attempts have been made to detect anisotropic diffusion from velocity autocorrelations. For isotropic diffusion there is a simple relation, connecting the asymptotic behaviour of the mean square displacement with the velocity autocorrelation, integrated over\ntime. For anisotropic diffusion h(\u2206rk (t))2 i is not simply related to the autocorrelation of\nvk (t) = v(t) * u(0), as noted in Ref. 24.\nIII.\nA.\n\nDYNAMICS OF HARD NEEDLES\nCollision rules\n\nThe phase space of needles is specified by the needles' translational and angular velocities\nvi , \u03c9 i and their center of mass positions ri and orientations ui , with i = 0 . . .

The normal and tangential component of the relative velocity after\n7\n\n\fthe collision (primed quantities) are given in terms of the respective components before the\ncollision as follows:\n(u\u22a5 * V\u2032 ) = \u2212(u\u22a5 * V)\n(u\u22a5 \u00d7 V\u2032 ) = \u2212\u03b2(u\u22a5 \u00d7 V)\n\n(14)\n(15)\n\nHere \u03b2 = \u22121 for smooth needles, and \u03b2 = 1 for totally rough needles, being the only values\nallowed by energy conservation. In terms of the particle's translational and angular velocities\nthe collision rules are the following:\np\u20320 = p0 + \u2206p\np\u20321 = p1 \u2212 \u2206p\ns01\nu0 \u00d7 \u2206p\n\u03c9 \u20320 = \u03c9 0 +\nI\ns10\nu1 \u00d7 \u2206p.\n\u03c9 \u20321 = \u03c9 1 \u2212\nI\nB.\n\n(16)\n\nPerfectly smooth needles: \u03b2 = \u22121\n\nIn this case, the translational momentum transfer occurs only perpendicular to the plane\nE01 , and is given by \u2206p = \u03b1u\u22a5 with\n\u03b1 = \u2212m\n\n(u\u22a5 * V)\n\u0001\nm 2\n1 + 2I\n(s01 + s210 )\n\n(17)\n\nThe temporal change of orientation u\u03070 is changed by a collision due to translational momentum transfer, I \u2206u\u03070 = s01 \u2206p.\n\nC.\n\nPerfectly rough needles: \u03b2 = 1\n\nRough needles also allow for a momentum transfer in the directions u0 and u\u22a5\n0:\n\u2206p = \u03b1u\u22a5 + \u03b31 u0 + \u03b32 u\u22a5\n0.\n\n(18)\n\nThe coefficients \u03b31 and \u03b32 are given by:\n1 + \u03b2 By \u2212 Cz\n2 AC \u2212 B 2\n1 + \u03b2 Bz \u2212 Ay\n\u03b32 =\n2 AC \u2212 B 2\n\n\u03b31 =\n\n8\n\n(19)\n(20)\n\n\fwith\n1\ns2\n+ 10 (1 \u2212 (u0 * u1 )2 )\nm\n2I\np\ns210\nB = \u2212 (u0 * u1 ) 1 \u2212 (u0 * u1 )2\n2I\n1\ns2\ns2\nC =\n+ 01 + 10 (u0 * u1 )2\nm\n2I\n2I\nA =\n\n(21)\n(22)\n(23)\n\nand the variables y, z as defined above.

The first part results\nfrom the Poisson bracket with the Hamiltonian of free translational motion and rotation,\niL0 = {H, . . . }. For N needles the Hamiltonian expressed in terms of generalized canonical\nmomenta is given as follows:\n\u0013\nN \u0012\nX\n1 2\n1 2\n1\n2\nH=\np\u03c6i\npri + p\u03b8i +\n2\n2m\n2I\n2I\nsin\n(\u03b8\n)\ni\ni=1\n\n(26)\n\nThe second part of the pseudo-Liouville-operator, describing binary collisions, reads\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0001 +\n\u0001\n1X d \u22a5\nd \u22a5\nL\nL\n\u2032\n+\niL+ =\n|rij | \u03b8 \u2212 |rij | \u03b8\n\u2212 |sij | \u03b8\n\u2212 |sji | \u03b4 |r\u22a5\nbij \u2212 1 .\nij | \u2212 0\n2 i6=j dt\ndt\n2\n2\n\n(27)\n\nd \u22a5\n|r |\ndt ij\n\naccounts for the flux of approach\u0001\nd \u22a5\n|rij | ).

Finally bij , acting on a phase space\nfunction A(\u0393), replaces linear and angular momenta before a collision by those after collision\naccording to the rules given in Eq. (16). One can equally consider the evolution backwards\nin time. The corresponding Liouville operator is given in Ref. 32.\n9\n\n\fIV.\n\nPROJECTION OPERATOR FORMALISM\n\nIn the following, autocorrelation functions of phase space functions or observables A(\u0393, t)\nwill be calculated:\n\u03a6(t) = hA\u2217 (\u0393, 0)A(\u0393, t)i\n= hA\u2217 (\u0393, 0) exp(iL+ t)A(\u0393, 0)i\n\n(28)\n\nThe bracket h. . . i defines an average with respect to the canonical ensemble with weight\n\n\u221d exp(\u2212H/T ). A\u2217 denotes the complex conjugate of A. For later purposes, the Laplace\ntransform is defined as follows:\nZ \u221e\n\u03a6(z) = i\ndteizt \u03c6(t) = \u2212hA\u2217 (\u0393, 0)\n0\n\nThe function \u03a6(z) is analytic for Im(z) > 0.\n\n1\nA(\u0393, 0)i.\nz + L+\n\n(29)\n\nFollowing Mori and Zwanzig we can represent the autocorrelation function in terms of\na continued fraction, which is suited to an approximation by truncation. Let us denote\nthe resolvent in Eq. (29) by R = (L+ + z)\u22121 and define a scalar product of two dynamic\n\nvariables A and B via the equilibrium expectation value as (A|B) := hA\u2217 Bi. The Laplace\ntransform of the autocorrelation can then be written as a matrix element of the resolvent\n\u03a6(z) = \u2212(A|(z + L+ )\u22121 A).\nThe idea behind the Mori Zwanzig formalism is to consider explicitly the dynamic evolution in a subspace of dynamic variables and treat the dynamics of the remaining variables\nin a simple approximation. The crux of the matter is to choose the right subspace. Popular\ncandidates are the conserved quantities, which are special because of their long relaxation\ntimes in the hydrodynamic limit. The fast degrees of freedom are then approximated by\na single relaxation time, similar in spirit to the single collision time approximation of the\nBoltzmann equation. We shall in the following consider the subspace spanned by \u03c1(r, u),\nbut first review the general formalism.\nWe consider a set of dynamic variables {Ai } with normalisation matrix (\u03c70 )ij =\n\n(Ai |Aj ) = hA\u2217i Aj i. The projector onto the subspace spanned by the {Ai } is given by\nP\n\u22121\nP\u03020 =\ni,j |Ai )(\u03c70 )ij (Aj |. The orthogonal projector is denoted by Q\u03020 = 1 \u2212 P\u03020 . Following the Mori-Zwanzig formalism we obtain an equation for the correlation functions\n\u03a6ij (z) = \u2212(Ai |(z + L+ )\u22121 Aj ). In matrix notation it reads\n\u0001\n\u22121\nz + \u03a90 \u03c7\u22121\n\u03a6(z) = \u2212\u03c70\n0 + M0 (z)\u03c70\n10\n\n(30)\n\n\fwith (\u03a90 )ij = (Ai |L+ Aj ) and the memory kernel\n(M0 )ij (z) = \u2212(Ai |L+ Q\u03020 (z + Q\u03020 L+ Q\u03020 )\u22121 Q\u03020 L+ Aj ).\n\n(31)\n\nSince the memory kernel is again a matrix element of a modified resolvent taken with the\nstate Bi = Q\u03020 L+ Ai , we can iterate the procedure, thereby representing the autocorrelation\nP\nas a continued fraction. We define a second projector P\u03021 = ij |Bi )(\u03c7\u22121\n1 )ij (Bj | and Q\u03021 =\n1 \u2212 P\u03021 and apply the same procedure to M0 (z),\n\n\u0001\n\u22121\nz + \u03a91 \u03c7\u22121\nM0 (z) = \u2212\u03c71 ,\n1 + M1 (z)\u03c71\n\n(32)\n\nwith (\u03c71 )ij = (Bi |Bj ), (\u03a91 ) = (Bi |L+ Bj ) and a second memory kernel M1 (z).\nIn principle this procedure can be iterated an arbitrary number of times. However the\ncomputation of the static expectation values \u03c7i and \u03a9i becomes increasingly complicated, so\nthat one ususally truncates the continued fraction after one or two steps. In the case of hard\ncore interactions the \"restoring forces\" \u03a9i are in general imaginary, because the Liouville\noperator is non hermitean. Hence even a truncation of the continued fraction with M1 = 0\n\u2013 the approximation scheme that will be adopted in this paper \u2013 will give rise to damping\neffects. This is in contrast to differentiable potentials with a Hermitean Liouville operator.\n\nV.\n\nCORRELATIONS OF COUPLED DENSITY ORIENTATION FLUCTUA-\n\nTIONS\nA.\n\nObservable and matrix elements\n\nWe are interested here in the anisotropic motion of a tagged rod-like macromolecule. In\nparticular we want to compute the anisotropic diffusion constants D\u22a5 and Dk as well as the\nrotational diffusion constant DR (see Eq.(1)) from a kinetic theory approach. The dynamic\nvariables of interest are thus the density of a tagged particle \u03c1(r, u) = \u03b4(r \u2212 r0 )\u03b4(u \u2212 u0 ) for\n\nall orientations u. It is convenient to consider its Fourier transform \u03c1(k, u) = e\u2212ikr0 \u03b4(u\u2212u0 )\nand compute the matrix of correlation functions\n\u03a6u,u\u2032 (k, z) = \u2212 (\u03c1(k, u)|(z + L+ )\u22121 \u03c1(k, u\u2032 ))\n\n(33)\n\nwhere the orientation vector u is the \"matrix subscript\".

Since \u03a90 and \u03c70 are trivial quantities, we will concentrate\non \u03a91 and \u03c71 and drop the subscript 1 from now on for notational simplicity. Additionally,\nwe absorb a factor of 1/\u03c70 = 4\u03c0 by defining \u03c6 = 4\u03c0\u03a6. Multiplying Eq. (30) from the left\nby (z + \u03a9\u03c7\u22121 ) (and using Eq.

We used system sizes of N = 800 to N = 2048\nand densities between \u03c10 = 0.25 and \u03c10 = 100. For the most part we used homogeneous\nrods with W = 6. The results of the simulations will be discussed below along with the\ntheoretical ones.\n\nVI.\n\nRESULTS\n\nIn this section we are going to discuss the results of the approximate kinetic theory\nobtained by setting M1 = 0. One might expect that our theory reduces to the diffusion\nequation of Perrin in the limit of small wave numbers kL \u226a 1 and long times. However,\nsuch a straightforward limit does not exist as we will show below.\nThere are two special cases where the comparison between microscopic theory and the\nPerrin equation is straightforward. One case concerns purely rotational motion. We show\nthat the theory predicts a crossover as a function of density from weakly damped free rotations to rotational diffusion. We furthermore obtain explicit expressions for the rotational\n14\n\n\fdiffusion constant of the Perrin theory as well as for the damping of the free rotations. The\nother important case which allows for direct comparison with the Perrin theory is purely\ntranslational motion, where we recover the isotropic diffusion constant.\nThe third and most interesting case, however, concerns the coupling of translational and\nrotational degrees of freedom. The comparison with the Perrin diffusion equation is not\ndirectly evident. In fact, we derive \u2013 within kinetic theory \u2013 the full time dependence of\nthe mean square displacements of a tagged rod parallel and perpendicular to its initial\norientation. We then compare our expressions to the corresponding ones obtained from the\nPerrin theory. An important problem arising in the analysis is the appearance of short\ntime scales present in the kinetic theory which are not easily decoupled from the longtime behavior. One would like to map the latter to the Perrin diffusion equation which\ninvolves only long-time diffusive time scales. Even within the Perrin theory, the anisotropic\ntranslational motion characterized by the diffusion constants Dk and D\u22a5 is only perceptible\non small times (compared to the rotational diffusion time) before the anisotropy is hidden\nby the long-time isotropic translational diffusion of the center of mass of the tagged rod.\nOn the side of kinetic theory, the time interval for anisotropic diffusion to be observed is\nbounded from below by ballistic motion which is isotropic a priori. We comment on this\npoint in more detail below when comparing our analytical results with simulations.\n\nA.\n\nRotational diffusion\n\nWe first discuss purely rotational motion, as obtained from the results of Sec. V by\nsetting k = 0. In order to compare with simulation results later on we focus on the Fourier\ntransform \u03c6(\u03c9) instead of the Laplace transform \u03c6(z) of the correlation function. Since in\nthe time domain \u03c6(t) is a real symmetric function, the Fourier and Laplace transforms are\nrelated via \u03c6(\u03c9) = 2Im(\u03c6(z = \u03c9 + i0)) where \u03c9 is real.\nThe correlation function for k = 0 is diagonal in the angular momentum quantum numbers and is given by\n\u03c6ll (z) = \u2212\n\nz \u2217 |z + i\u03b6|2 \u2212 (z + i\u03b6)\u03c9l2\n|z 2 \u2212 \u03c9l2 |2 + |z|2 \u03b6 2 + 2Im(\u03b6z \u2217 (z 2 \u2212 \u03c9l2))\n\n(48)\n\n\u03b6\u03c9l2\n.\n(\u03c9 2 \u2212 \u03c9l2)2 + \u03c9 2 \u03b6 2\n\n(49)\n\nwith \u03c9l2 = TI l(l + 1) and \u03b6 = 4\u03c0\u03ba TI . The Fourier transform is\n\u03c6ll (\u03c9) = 2\n\n15\n\n\fThe correlation function Eq. (49) has two poles in the lower complex frequency plane\np\nat \u03c9 = \u2212i\u03b6/2 \u00b1 (\u03c9l2 \u2212 \u03b6 2/4) and the corresponding complex conjugates in the upper\nhalf plane. It shows qualitatively different behaviour depending on the reduced density\n\n\u03c10 = n0 L3 . For low density the poles have a nonzero real part, corresponding to weakly\ndamped oscillatory motion of the rods:\n\u03c6ll (t) =\n\n1\nexp (\u2212\u03b6t/2) (\u03c9l cos (\u03c9l t) + \u03b6 sin (\u03c9l t))\n\u03c9l\n\nThe real part of the poles vanishes above a critical density \u03c1crit (l) =\n\n(50)\n\u0010\n\u00111/2\n3\nl(l + 1) c8\u03c0\n2W\nR\n\nwhich depends on l. For large density the time dependent correlation function is a sum\nof two exponentials with the long relaxation time \u03c4long (l) = (DR l(l + 1))\u22121 and the short\nrelaxation time \u03c4short = \u03b6 \u22121. The decay on long times corresponds to rotational diffusion\nand is in agreement with the Perrin theory. The rotational diffusion constant is given by\nr\n2\u03c0 3/2\nT\nDR =\n(51)\n\u03c10 LcR m\nOur approximate theory does not describe the free particle limit \u03c10 \u2192 0 correctly. In\nparticular the weakly damped oscillations acquire additional damping due to free particle\nmotion (sometimes called motional narrowing). We discuss a simple way to account for\nthese additional terms approximately.\nIf there are no interactions, the angular correlations are simply given by\nZ \u221e\n\u03c92 I\nI\n0\n\u03c6ll (t) = hPl (cos \u03c9t)ith =\nd\u03c9 \u03c9 Pl (cos \u03c9t) e\u2212 2T .\nT\n0\n\n(52)\n\nFor example for l = 1 (the case we will need below) the correlation function \u03c6011 (z) can be\nexpressed in terms of the exponential integral function E1 (z)36 .\nA simple way to incorporate free particle motion is the following. One represents the\ncorrelation function \u03c60ll as a continued fraction with \u03a9 = 0 but M 6= 0 (see Eq. (30)),\n\u03c60ll (z) = \u2212\n\n1\nz\u2212\n\n4\u03c0\u03c7l\nz+Ml /\u03c7l\n\n.\n\n(53)\n\nThen the memory kernel is expressed in terms of \u03c60ll ,\nz + Ml /\u03c7l = 4\u03c0\u03c7l\n\n16\n\n\u03c60ll (z)\n,\nz\u03c60ll (z) + 1\n\n(54)\n\n\fand can now substituted in the continued fraction for the interacting system. This procedure\nyields\n\u03c6ll (z) =\n\n\u03a9l\n(z\u03c60ll + 1) + 4\u03c0\u03c60ll \u03c7l\n\u03c7\n\u2212 l \u03a9l\n.\nz \u03c7l (z\u03c60ll + 1) + 4\u03c0\u03c7l\n\n(55)\n\nWe now compare the Fourier transform \u03c6ll (\u03c9) = 2Im(\u03c6ll (z = \u03c9 + i0)) for the case\nl = 1, which corresponds to the correlation function \u03c611 (t) = hu0 (t) * u0 (0)i, with numerical\nsimulations in Fig 2. Agreement is very good for small densities because the free particle\nlimit has been incorporated. Our approximate theory also reproduces the crossover from\ndamped oscillations, corresponding to a peak at finite frequency in the spectrum, to purely\nrelaxational motion, characterized by a peak at zero frequency.\n\nB.\n\nTranslational dynamics\n\nNext we discuss purely translational motion, obtained from the general results by setting\nl = l\u2032 = 0, i.e. by examining the correlation function \u03c600 as given in Eq. (46). Its Fourier\ntransform is given by\n\u03c600 (\u03c9) = 2\nwith \u03be =\n\nc +2c\n\u03bd k(2\u03c0)2\u22a5 .\n\n(kvth )2\n(\u03c9 2 \u2212 (kvth )2 )2 + \u03be 2 \u03c9 2\n\nHere we have introduced the Enskog collision frequency \u03bd =\n\n2\nthe thermal velocity vth\n= T /m.\n\n(56)\n2\u03c10\n3L\n\nq\n\n\u03c0T\nm\n\nand\n\nThe corresponding time dependent correlation function is the sum of two exponentials.\nThe decay rate of the fast component, \u03c40 , is determined by the collision rate according to\n\u03c40\u22121 = \u03bd(ck + 2c\u22a5 )/(2\u03c0)2 . The decay rate of the slow component is diffusive as it should\nbe, due to particle number conservation. Since we consider translational motion only and\nconsequently have set l = 0 in the equation of motion, we should recover the isotropic\ndiffusion constant of the Perrin theory. The latter predicts Diso = (Dk +2D\u22a5 )/3. Comparison\nwith the Perrin theory allows us to identify\nDiso\n\nv 2 (2\u03c0)2\n= th\n=\n\u03bd ck + 2c\u22a5\n\nr\n\nT\u03c0\n6\u03c0L\n.\nm \u03c10 (ck + 2c\u22a5 )\n\n(57)\n\nThe ratio of the rotational to the isotropic translational diffusion constant is given in the\nKirkwood-Riseman theory5 by DR /Diso = 9/L2 . Even though this theory is designed for\na rodlike molecule in a solvent where hydrodynamic interactions are important, we do find\n17\n\n\falmost the same result for a melt of smooth needles with a homogeneous mass distribution:\nDR /Diso = (ck + 2c\u22a5 )/(3cR L2 ) = 8.89/L2 (see Tab. I). The ratio does depend on the mass\ndistribution though and is different for smooth and rough rods.\nIn summary, our approximate kinetic theory correctly describes particle diffusion which\ndominates the long time decay of the translational correlation function. It yields an approximate expression for the isotropic diffusion constant, which is inversely proportional to\nthe density \u03c10 . The decay of the nonconserved variables has been approximated by a single\nrelaxation time, which is inversely proportional to the Enskog collision frequency.\n\nC.\n1.\n\nCoupled translational and rotational dynamics: kinetic theory\nFrom correlation functions to mean square displacements\n\nOur next goal is to calculate the mean-square displacement of the tagged rod, decomposed\ninto the directions parallel and perpendicular to its initial orientation u0 (0). We define the\ntensor\nR\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 = h\u2206r\u03b1 (t)\u2206r\u03b2 (t)u0\u03b3 (0)u0\u03b4 (0)i,\n\n(58)\n\nwhere \u2206r(t) = r0 (t) \u2212 r0 (0) is the displacement of the tagged rod. This tensor R\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 is\nisotropic and symmetric under exchange of the indices \u03b1 and \u03b2 and also of \u03b3 and \u03b4. These\nsymmetries imply that there are only two independent tensor components R1 and R2 such\nthat\nR\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 = \u03b4\u03b1\u03b2 \u03b4\u03b3\u03b4 R1 + (\u03b4\u03b1\u03b3 \u03b4\u03b2\u03b4 + \u03b4\u03b1\u03b4 \u03b4\u03b2\u03b3 )R2 .\n\n(59)\n\nIn order to calculate R\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 , we express it in terms of the correlation function \u03a6,\n\u22022\neik*\u2206r(t) u0\u03b3 (0)u0\u03b4 (0)\n\u2202k\u03b1 \u2202k\u03b2\nk=0\nZ\n2\n\u2202\n=\u2212\n.\ndu du\u2032 u\u2032\u03b3 u\u2032\u03b4 \u03a6uu\u2032 (k, t)\nk=0\n\u2202k\u03b1 \u2202k\u03b2\n\nR\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 = \u2212\n\n(60)\n\nThe total mean-square displacement can easily be expressed in terms of this tensor as\nX\nX \u22022 Z\n\u22022\n\u2032\n2\n\u2032\n= \u22123 2 \u03c600\ndu du \u03a6uu (k, t)\nh\u2206r (t)i =\nR\u03b1\u03b1\u03b2\u03b2 = 9R1 + 6R2 = \u2212\n\u2202k\u03b12\n\u2202k\nk=0\nk=0\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\u03b2\n\n(61)\n\n18\n\n\f(recall that \u03a6 and \u03c6 are identical up to a factor of 4\u03c0). In the last step the derivatives\nbecome simpler since \u03c600 is only a function of k 2 (cf. Eq. (46)).\nIn terms of R1 and R2 the parallel mean-square displacement is given by (cf. Eq.

Thus it suffices to evaluate the term with e.g.\n\u03b1 = 3.\nEqs.

Therefore, we need\nto analyse the poles of \u03c600 (k, z) and \u03c620 (k, z). The denominators of \u03c600 (k, z) and \u03c620 (k, z)\nconsist of factors of the form z 2 +\n\n\u03a9n\nz\n\u03c7n\n\n\u2212 4\u03c0\u03c7n (n = 0, 2).

(46) and (47) into partial\nfractions and carry out the inverse Laplace transforms. From Eqs. (64) and (65) we then\nget the mean-square displacements. Before we show the results of this straighforward but\ntedious calculation, we note that the long-time behavior on long length scales (k \u2192 0)\nis determined by the pole or poles closest to the origin. Each pole zn,\u00b1 corresponds to a\ntimescale 1/(izn,\u00b1 ) (provided zn,\u00b1 is purely imaginary, see below). Inserting the values from\nEq.

For\nlarge densities, however, \u03c42 becomes proportional to the density and thus large, too. This\nindicates that, at least for high densities, there are two long time scales. The other two\ntimes scales, \u03c40 and \u03c41 , are short. The first one, \u03c40 , is related to the Enskog collision time.\nThe second one, \u03c41 , is of the same order as \u03c40 . For large densities it agrees with the short\nrotational timescale \u03c4short from Sec. VI A.

It also agrees with the crossover time from Perrin theory, see Eqs.

The diffusion constants D\u22a5 = Diso \u2212 12 \u2206D and\nDk = Diso + \u2206D in this regime can be calculated from Eq.

This is exemplified in Fig. 4. For densities above\n21\n\n\f\u2248 20 the isotropic diffusion constants (slopes of the mean square displacements) increase\n\nwith density in the simulation. This effect is well known23,24 and is due to enhanced parallel\n\ndiffusion along a tube formed by surrounding particles. This involves correlated particle\ncollisions and is thus not captured within our theory. Therefore the theory does not fit the\ndata quantitatively but Fig. 4 shows that the anisotropy is very well captured qualitatively.\nBut even though anisotropy is clearly present, it can (at these densities) not adequately be\ndescribed by anisotropic diffusion constants since the anisotropy window is still small and\nwithin it, no convincing \"straight line fit\" appears possible. This is true for both theory and\nsimulation.\nFig. 5 shows a direct comparison of theory and simulations of the mean-square displacements for densities \u03c10 = 40 and \u03c10 = 100. Here it becomes obvious that the isotropic\ndiffusion constant is underestimated by the theory. The simulations at \u03c10 = 100 now very\nclearly show anisotropic diffusion with a well-defined perpendicular diffusion constant D\u22a5 .\nThe parallel diffusion constant Dk , on the other hand, is still not well defined even at this\ndensity.\nThe anisotropy becomes even more pronounced for dumbbell molecules with W = 2 at\n\u03c1 = 100, which is shown in Fig. 6. The reason the effect is more pronounced for dumbbells\nlies in the W -dependence of the diffusion constants. While \u2206D is proportional to 1/W (see\nEq. (76)), Diso is only weakly dependent on W through ck and c\u22a5 . Therefore anisotropic\ndiffusion is more pronounced for smaller W .\n\nVII.\n\nDISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK\n\nBefore we go into a discussion of the details of our results we will give a brief overview of\nour main findings. The aim of this paper is to gain some microscopic understanding of the\ntransport properties of a gas of thin hard rods beyond the phenomenological Perrin equation.\nPurely rotational and translational dynamics of a tagged particle can be described by simple\nrotational or translational diffusion, in agreement with the Perrin equation, allowing us to\ncalculate the rotational and isotropic translational diffusion constants. The motion of a\ntagged particle along and perpendicular to its original orientation shows marked anisotropies.\nThe nature of the anisotropy is, however, very different from the one predicted by Perrin\ntheory, at least for low and medium densities. This is confirmed by simulations. The\n22\n\n\fPerrin equation predicts anisotropies which can be described as anisotropic diffusion for all\ndensities. In contrast, our results for low densities exhibit only a very drawn-out crossover\nfrom ballistic motion for short times to isotropic diffusion at long times with no intermediate\nregime which could be characterized as anisotropic diffusion. For medium densities \u03c10 \u2248 40\nsuch a regime begins to emerge; it is however still far from being well-defined. Even for\ndensities \u03c10 = 100 where the mean-square displacement is clearly anisotropic, anisotropic\ndiffusion is only seen in the perpendicular motion.\nWe have derived an approximate theory for the coupled translational and rotational\nmotion of thin hard rods, starting from a microscopic model. The dynamic evolution is determined by binary collisions, in which the normal component of the velocity of the contact\npoint is reversed and the tangential component is either left unchanged (smooth rods) or\nreversed as well (rough rods). The Mori-Zwanzig projection operator formalism has been\napplied to the correlation of a tagged rod's density \u03c1(r, u, t), specifying its position r and\norientation u at a given time t. Matrix elements of the collision operator have been computed, resulting in a generalized Enskog theory, in which only uncorrelated binary collisions\nare taken into account \u2013 similar in spirit to a \"Stosszahl Ansatz\" of the corresponding Boltzmann equation. Two steps in a continued fraction expansion give rise to an integral equation\nfor the correlation function. This equation has been solved in the limit of small wavenumber,\nwhere it is rendered diagonal by linear combinations of the spherical harmonics. We have\nalso performed numerical simulations, using an event driven algorithm for hard needles.\nPurely rotational motion (k = 0) is as expected and in agreement with previous discussions. For small density we observe damped oscillations with a frequency \u03c9 2 = T /I. In\nthe dilute limit it is essential to include free particle motion, which provides the dominant\ndamping mechanism.\nFor large densities the dynamics is purely relaxational. The crossover happens at a critical\ndensity \u03c12crit (l) = 8\u03c0 3 l(l +1)/(cR W ) which depends on the angular momentum l, the moment\nof inertia via W =\n\nmL2\n2I\n\nand on whether we are considering smooth or rough rods. For\n\n\u03c10 \u2265 \u03c1crit (l) our approximate kinetic theory predicts two relaxation times. The longer one is\n\ndetermined by the rotational diffusion constant according to \u03c4long (l) = (DR l(l + 1))\u22121 with\nthe rotational diffusion constant DR given by Eq. (51). It depends on the mass distribution\nalong the rod and is different for smooth and rough needles. The rotational diffusion constant\nDR is always larger for smooth rods than for rough rods, e.g. for a homogeneous mass\n23\n\n\frough\nsmooth\ndistribution along the rod we find DR\n/DR\n\u2248 1.60.\n\nThe long time relaxation \u03c4long (l) = (DR l(l+1))\u22121 is in agreement with the Perrin equation,\n\nwhere DR enters as a phenomenological parameter. In addition our theory also predicts a\nfast decay with a relaxation rate \u03c4short = DR I/T or alternatively\n\n\u03c4short\n\u03c4long\n\n=\n\n2I\nDR\nl(l+1)\nT\n\n= ( \u03c12\u03c1crit0 )2 .\n\nThis short relaxation time is mainly determined by the moment of inertia and hence roughly\nthree times larger for dumbbells than for a homogeneous mass distribution.\nNext we discussed purely translational motion (l = 0). We find relaxation with a short\nand a long relaxation time, the latter being diffusive \u03c4l = (Diso k 2 )\u22121 and in agreement with\nthe Perrin equation, which allowed us to identify the isotropic diffusion constant Diso as\nin Eq. (57). It depends on the mass distribution and is different for smooth and rough\nneedles. The isotropic diffusion constant is always larger for smooth needles than for rough\nrough\nsmooth\nones, e.g. for a homogeneous mass distribution along the rod we find Diso\n/Diso\n\u2248 2.36.\n\nComparing different mass distributions we always find a larger diffusion constant for the\nhomogeneous mass distribution than for the dumbbells. In addition to the diffusive long\ntime decay, the kinetic theory predicts partial decay on a microscopic timescale, which is\ngiven by \u03c40 = Diso m/T .\nThe most interesting case is of course the coupled translational and rotational motion, as\ndescribed by the time dependent correlation \u03a6u,u\u2032 (k, t). This function has been diagonalised\nin the long wavelength limit by linear combinations of spherical harmonics, which for general\nk, l, m differ from the solution to the Perrin equation. We attribute this difference to the\nfact that the Perrin equation is not simply a gradient expansion but involves the angular\nmomentum operator, which does not contain any small parameter allowing for a systematic\nexpansion.\nAnisotropic diffusion is best discussed with the help of the particle's displacement vector, projected onto or perpendicular to the particle's initial orientation, i.e. h\u2206rk2 (t)i and\n\n2\nh\u2206r\u22a5\n(t)i. In general, we find three dynamic regimes. For short times t \u226a \u03c40 the motion is\n\nballistic. For the longest timescales, i.e. times larger than the timescale for rotation of a\nneedle, t \u226b 1/(6DR ), isotropic diffusion prevails. In between a time regime appears which\nis characterized by anisotropic diffusion: a linear increase of the mean square displacements\n2\nh\u2206rk2 (t)i \u223c Dk t and h\u2206r\u22a5\n(t)i \u223c D\u22a5 t with anisotropic diffusion constants Dk and D\u22a5 . To\n\nclearly see this intermediate regime, the density has to be sufficiently large, such that the\ntimescale for rotational diffusion of the rods is long. In the simulations these three time\n24\n\n\fregimes are clearly visble for densities \u03c10 \u2265 40 (see Fig. 4). The analytical theory correctly\npredicts anisotropic diffusion qualitatively (see Fig. 4), however for such high densities no\nquantitative agreement between simulations and theory is achieved, see Fig. 5. Anisotropic\ndiffusion is more pronounced for a higher moment of inertia, the highest value being reached\nfor dumbbells with all the mass concentrated at the endpoints of the needle (see Fig. 6).\nLowering the density leads to shrinking of the intermediate time regime, such that for small\ndensities (\u03c10 \u2264 10) one only observes a crossover from ballistic motion to isotropic diffusion.\nFor these densities the agreement between theory and simulation is very good, as shown in\nFig. 3.\nSince the intermediate anisotropic regime is only present for high densities, we conclude\nthat the Perrin equation is an adequate description of the dynamics of thin hard rods only\nfor high density. In order to derive it from a microscopic theory, it is not sufficient to let\nthe wavenumber become small; in addition the rotational diffusion constant has to be small\nor in other words the rotational timescale has to be long.\nA perspective for future work based on the microscopic theory presented here would be to\nexploit the correlation function to calculate intermediate scattering functions. These could\nthen be measured in depolarized light scattering experiments. Moreover, the microscopic\ntheory is valid for all wave vectors. However, up to now, a diagonalization procedure used\nto derive explicit expressions for \u03c6ll\u2032 exists only for small wave vectors.\n\nAPPENDIX A: MATRIX ELEMENTS\n\nIn this appendix, the essential steps necessary to calculate the matrix elements \u03c70 ,\n\u03a90 (u\u2032 , u), \u03c71 (u\u2032 , u), and \u03a91 (u\u2032 , u) are presented.\n\n1.\n\nGenerating functional\n\nThe structure of the collision operator requires a specific coordinate system for the translational momenta (or velocities).\nIn fact, the operator iL\u2032+ appearing in matrix elements is reduced to the N-fold operator\n\n25\n\n\ffor collision of needle 0 with needle 1,\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0001 +\n\u0001\nL\nL\n\u2032\n+\niL+ = N |V * u\u22a5 | \u03b8(\u2212V * u\u22a5 \u03c3)\u03b8\n\u2212 |s01 | \u03b8\n\u2212 |s10 | \u03b4 |r\u22a5\nb01 \u2212 1 .

The relative velocity of contact points V\nand its representation in the orthonormal basis u\u22a5 , u\u22a5\n0 , u0 have been defined in section III.\nBefore performing the transformation, let us recall the definition of the integration measure\nin average h. . . i in terms of canonical coordinates:\nd\u0393 =\n\n1\nY\n\ndri d\u03c6i d\u03b8i dpri dp\u03c6i dp\u03b8i\n\n(A3)\n\ni=0\n\nThe normalization reads as\nZ \u22121 =\n\n1 1\n1\n1\n2\n2\n3\nV (4\u03c0) (2\u03c0mT ) (2\u03c0IT )2\n\n(A4)\n\nNext, the canonical coordinates are transformed to new ones which are standard normally\ndistributed (with respect to the Boltzmann factor exp(\u2212\u03b2H)). Changing moreover translation momenta pri to CMS momentum and relative momentum, the transformation reads as\nfollows:\n1\n(p0 \u2212 p1 )\n2T m\n1\n(p0 + p1 )\n\u03b3 = \u221a\n2T m\n1\nP\u03b8i = \u221a p\u03b8i\nIT\n1\np\u03c6i\nP \u03c6i = \u221a\nIT sin(\u03b8i )\n\u03c7 = \u221a\n\n(A5)\n(A6)\n(A7)\n(A8)\n\nwith i = 0, 1. Positions are transformed according to\nr01 = r0 \u2212 r1\nr = r0\n\n(A9)\n(A10)\n\nThe resulting integration with respect to r01 will be split into the following three components:\nc = r01 * u\u22a5\nr01 * u\u22a5\n0\nb = s10 = p\n1 \u2212 (u0 * u1 )2\n(u0 * u1 )(r01 * u\u22a5\n0)\na = \u2212s01 = r01 * u0 \u2212 p\n1 \u2212 (u0 * u1 )2\n26\n\n(A11)\n(A12)\n(A13)\n\n\fThis decomposition complements the one for the relative velocity of contact points.

Following a\nsuggestion by Huthmann, one may transform from standard normally distributed variables\n(P\u03c6i , P\u03b8i ) with respect to the base (\u00ea\u03c6i , \u00ea\u03b8i ) to new standard normally distributed variables\n(vi , wi ) with respect to the base (u\u22a5\ni , u\u22a5 ), giving the following expression for Vr :\nr\nr\n2T\nT\n\u03c7 \u2212 a\n(v0 u\u22a5\nVr =\n0 + w0 u\u22a5 )\nm\nrI\nT\n\u2212 b\n(v1 u\u22a5\n1 + w1 u\u22a5 )\nI\n\n(A16)\n\nLater, on u\u22a5\n1 will be eliminated using\n\u22a5\nu\u22a5\n1 = \u2212\u00c3u0 + B\u0303u0\n\n(A17)\n\nwhere\n\u00c3 =\n\np\n1 \u2212 (u0 * u1 )2\n\nB\u0303 = (u0 * u1 )\n\n(A18)\n(A19)\n\nSo a decomposition of Vr with respect to the base (u\u22a5 , u\u22a5\n0 , u0 ) results.\nIn terms of the variables (\u03b3, \u03c7, v0 , w0 , v1 , w1 ) the 2-needle Hamiltonian reads\n\u03b2H =\n\n\u0001\n1 2\n\u03b3 + \u03c72 + v02 + w02 + v12 + w12 .\n2\n\n(A20)\n\nAccordingly, the integration measure multiplied by the normalization changes to\nZ \u22121 d\u0393 =\n\n1 1\n1\ndrdadbdcd\u03a90 d\u03a91 d\u03b3d\u03c7dv0 dw0 dv1 dw1\nV 2 (4\u03c0)2 (2\u03c0)5\n27\n\n(A21)\n\n\fwhere d\u03a9i = d\u03c6i sin(\u03b8i )d\u03b8i defines the integration with respect to spatial angles. Now, the\ncollision operator involves a projection of Vr . Moreover, \u03b3 is related to Vr by Eq. (A16).\nTherefore, \u03b3 will have to be expressed in terms of Vr in the integration measure and the\n\u0001\nm 3/2\nHamiltonian.

The matrix\nelements are\nB =\nll\u2032\n\nZ\n\nd\u03b7 d\u03b7 \u2032 Sl0 (0, \u03b7)B\u03b7\u03b7\u2032 Sl\u2032 0 (0, \u03b7 \u2032).\n\n(D1)\n\nSince \u03c7 is already diagonal in this basis, nothing needs to be done for the term z\u03c7\u22121 and\nwe get z(\u03c7\u22121 )ll\u2032 = z\u03b4ll\u2032 /\u03c7l .\nThe term \u03c7\u22121 \u03a9\u03c7\u22121 is more complicated. Inserting 1 =\nplaces between \u03c7\u22121 and \u03a9 we get\n\nP\n\nl\n\n|Sl0 (ic))(Sl0 (ic)| in the two\n\nBll\u2032 = z\u03b4ll\u2032 /\u03c7l + (\u03c7\u22121 \u03a9\u03c7\u22121 )ll\u2032\n= z\u03b4ll\u2032 /\u03c7l + \u03b4ll\u2032\n\n\u03a9l\n+ \u2206Bll1 \u2032 + \u2206Bll2 \u2032 + \u2206Bll3 \u2032 ,\n\u03c72l\n\n(D2)\nwhere\n\n\u03a9l \u2212 \u03a9l\u2032\n,\n\u03c7l \u03c7l\u2032\nc4\n\u03a9l\u2032\n\u03a9l\n\u2206Bll2 \u2032 = (h0l\u2032 0 \u03b4l0 + h0l0 \u03b4l\u2032 0 ),\n\u03c70\n\u03c7l\u2032\n\u03c7l\n4 X\nc\n\u2206Bll3 \u2032 =\ng0jl g0jl\u2032 \u03a9j\n\u03c7l \u03c7l\u2032 j\n\n\u2206Bll1 \u2032 = c2 g0ll\u2032\n\n(D3)\n(D4)\n(D5)\n(D6)\n\nto order k 2 . The calculation is straightforward but care has to be taken with \u03c70 and \u03a90\nas they are of order k 2 while all other eigenvalues of \u03c7 and \u03a9 are of order 1. Therefore\n1\n1\nthe matrix elements \u2206B02\nand \u2206B20\nare of order 1. However, all other off-diagonal matrix\n\nelements of B are of order k 2 or smaller. The diagonal element B00 is of order 1/k 2 while\nall other diagonal elements are of order 1. In order to be able to use perturbation theory we\nemploy a Jacobi transformation\nRll\u2032 = \u03b4ll\u2032 + (cos\n\nB02\nB02\n\u2212 1)(\u03b4l0 \u03b4l\u2032 0 + \u03b4l2 \u03b4l\u2032 2 ) + sin\n(\u03b4l0 \u03b4l\u2032 2 \u2212 \u03b4l2 \u03b4l\u2032 0 ).\nB00\nB00\n\n(D7)\n\nwhich makes RBRT = D + k 2 \u2206 where D is a diagonal matrix and \u2206 is a perturbation. Note\nthat R is really only required up to order k 2 which is\nRll\u2032 = \u03b4ll\u2032 +\n\nB02\n(\u03b4l0 \u03b4l\u2032 2 \u2212 \u03b4l2 \u03b4l\u2032 0 ) + O(k 4 ).\nB00\n\n(D8)\n\nThe eigenvalues bl of B (up to order k 2 ) are given by the diagonal entries of RBRT since\nthe Jacobi transformation merely changes the basis vectors but not the eigenvalues. The\n34\n\n\fdiagonal entries of RBRT are equal to bl = Bll = z/\u03c7l + \u03a9l /\u03c72l for all l 6= 0, 2. For the two\n\n2\n2\nexceptions one gets b0 = B00 + 2B02\n/B00 (l = 0) and b2 = B22 \u2212 B02\n/B00 (l = 2). These\n\nare, however, higher order corrections which are irrelevant for our purposes and we may\ntherefore use bl = z/\u03c7l + \u03a9l /\u03c72l for all l.\nFinally, the eigenfunctions Sl\u2032 (\u03b7) can be obtained through perturbation theory. The\nmatrix Bll\u2032 is symmetric but not normal (i.e. [B, B \u2020 ] 6= 0, except if z happens to be purely\n\nimaginary). Therefore B and of course also RBRT do not have an orthogonal system of\neigenvectors and we have to calculate both left and right eigenvectors perturbatively. This\nprocedure yields for the matrix O r of right eigenvectors of RBRT (Ollr \u2032 is the l\u2032 th component\nof the lth eigenvector),\n(RBRT )l\u2032 l\n,\nbl \u2212 bl\u2032\n\n(D9)\n\n(RBRT )\u2217l\u2032 l\n= (Ollr \u2032 )\u2217\n\u2217\n(bl \u2212 bl\u2032 )\n\n(D10)\n\nOllr \u2032 = \u03b4ll\u2032 + (1 \u2212 \u03b4ll\u2032 )\nwhile the matrix O l of left eigenvectors is\nOlll \u2032 = \u03b4ll\u2032 + (1 \u2212 \u03b4ll\u2032 )\n\nand the asterisk denotes the complex conjugate.\nThe right and left eigenfunctions Slr (\u03b7) and Sll (\u03b7) of the original operator B are then\nSlr (\u03b7) =\n\nX\n\n(O r\u2217 R)ll\u2032 Sl\u2032 0 (0, \u03b7)\n\n(D11)\n\n(O l R)\u2217ll\u2032 Sl\u2032 0 (0, \u03b7).\n\n(D12)\n\nl\u2032\n\nSll (\u03b7) =\n\nX\nl\u2032\n\nThe product O l R is, up to order k 2 ,\n(O l R)ll\u2032 = \u03b4ll\u2032 +\n\nB02\n(\u03b4l0 \u03b4l\u2032 2 \u2212 \u03b4l2 \u03b4l\u2032 0 )+\nB00\n(RBRT )\u2217l\u2032 l\n(1 \u2212 \u03b4ll\u2032 )\n(bl \u2212 bl\u2032 )\u2217\n\n(D13)\n(D14)\n\nAs an application which is needed in the main text we calculate some matrix elements of\nthe correlation function \u03c6 in the basis of spherical functions Sl0 (0, \u03b7).
