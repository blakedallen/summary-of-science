We estimate S independently for all normal and Seyfert galaxies whose radial\nvelocity is \u226414000 km s\u22121 , and which had at least one supernova event recorded in\nthe Asiago catalogue from January 1986 to August 2000. We find that the ratio S is\n\u2248 0.23\u00b10.05 in normal galaxies. This value is consistent with constant star formation\nrate and with a Salpeter Initial Mass Function and average binary rate \u2248 50%. On the\ncontrary, Seyfert galaxies exceed the ratio S in normal galaxies by a factor \u2248 4 at a\nconfidence level >\n\u223c 2\u03c3. A caveat is that the numbers for Seyferts are still small (6 type\nIb-Ic and 6 type II supernovae discovered as yet). Assumed real, this excess of type\nIb and Ic with respect to type II supernovae, may indicate a burst of star formation\n< 20 Myr), a high incidence of binary systems in the inner regions (r\nof young age (\u03c4 \u223c\n< 0.4R ) of Seyfert galaxies, or a top-loaded mass function.\n25\n\u223c\nKey words: galaxies: nuclei - galaxies: Seyfert \u2013 galaxies: starburst \u2013 stars: formation\n\u2013 galaxies: stellar content \u2013 stars: supernovae: general\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe relationship between circum-nuclear star formation and\nnon-thermal nuclear activity is as yet poorly understood.\nWhile the possibility that non-thermal activity may be entirely ascribed to massive stars and to supernova events\n(Terlevich & Melnick 1988; ?) is challenged by several lines\nof evidence, it is unlikely that the onset of nuclear activity\nand strong nuclear or circum-nuclear star formation can be\nfully unrelated phenomena. Supernovae may not be responsible for the optical spectrum and emission line of Seyfert\n1 galaxies, but reprocessed gas of supernova ejections may\neventually be accreted by the central black hole, influencing the opacity and hence the radiating properties of the\naccretion disk which is reputed to be one of the ultimate\ncomponents of the AGN central engine.\nCore-collapse supernovae from massive progenitors, albeit rare events, are diagnostics of recent star formation.\nThe aim of this paper is to estimate the ratio between\nthe total number of Ib-Ic supernovae type II supernovae\n[S=N(Ib/c)/N(II)] discovered in a suitable sample of nonactive (hereafter normal) galaxies, as well as to compare it\nto that of Seyfert galaxies. As we will show through this paper, the ratio S reflects metallicity, age, fraction of binary\nsystems, and initial mass function (IMF) shape effects which\nc 0000 RAS\n\nare probably much different in normal and (at least in some)\nSeyfert galaxies.\n\n2\n\nSAMPLE SELECTION & CRITERION\n\nWe cross correlated the latest available Asiago Supernova\nCatalogue (last supernova recorded: 2000di on Aug. 23)\n(Barbon et al. 1993) with the 9th edition of A Catalogue\nof Quasars and Active Galactic Nuclei by M. - P. V\u00e9ronCetty and P. V\u00e9ron (V\u00e9ron-Cetty & V\u00e9ron2000). All AGN\n<\nhosting a supernova have vr \u223c\n14, 000km s\u22121 . A temporal\nrestriction is needed since type Ib and Ic supernovae, first\nobserved in the 1960s (Bertola 1964) were labeled as peculiar \"type I\" supernovae for more than two decades. The\nrealization that they are a different class of objects came\nafter two decades, around 1985 (Elias et al. 1985; Panagia,\nSramek, & Weiler 1986; Porter & Filippenko 1987). We limit\nour counts to supernovae discovered after Dec. 31, 1985. Only\nfew identification of type Ib/c supernovae discovered earlier\nthan Jan. 1, 1986 are available (as a product of subsequent\nre-identification of older type I spectra).\nWe define a sample of \"normal\" galaxies as including all galaxies listed in the Asiago Catalogue with\n<\nvr \u223c\n14, 000km s\u22121 , not classified as Seyfert (including un-\n\n\f2\n\nA Bressan et al.\n\nTable 1.

The\nSeyfert sample comprises all Seyfert galaxies as above but\ncoded as S1, S2 or S1x in the catalogue (see Table 1 for\nsample sizes).\nWe restrict our comparison to the rate of type Ib-Ic and\nII supernovae, since the control time \u03c4c is approximately the\nsame for both type Ib/c and type II supernovae. The difference in brightness and light curve shape between type Ib-Ic\nand type II supernovae would translate in a \u2206\u03c4c /\u03c4c \u2248 15\n% (Cappellaro et al. 1993), which is marginal with respect\nto the magnitude of the effects we are considering (a factor\n\u2248 4; see \u00a73). Even if Seyfert galaxies and normal galaxies\nhave been monitored over different times, and with different\ntechniques, the ratio N(Ib/c)/N(II) should almost reproduce\nthe true ratio of supernova rates for type Ib/c and type II\n(but clearly not each supernova rate in supernova units!). In\nother words, we have SNR(Ib/c)/SNR(II) = N(Ib/c)/(0.01\n\u03c4Ib/c ) \u00d7 0.01 \u03c4II /N(II) \u2248 N(Ib/c)/N(II), where \u03c4 is in centuries, SNR is expressed in number of supernovae per year,\nand \u03c4c (II)\u2248 \u03c4c (Ib/c). Selection effects, described in the next\nsection, will operate in the same way in both galaxy samples.\nThe Seyfert sample is dominated by Seyfert 2 galaxies,\nand at any rate by very low luminosity AGN. The average\nabsolute magnitude of the Seyfert 2 sample is MB \u2248 \u221219.1\n(taking the data of the V\u00e9ron-Cetty and V\u00e9ron Catalogue)\nThe S1x nuclei are, on average, of similar luminosity (MB \u2248\n\u221219.3). In complete samples, Seyfert 1 nuclei are on average\na factor 100 brighter than Seyfert 2 (see also \u00a75).\n\n3\n3.1\n\nRESULTS\nThe Distribution of Core Collapse Supernova\nTypes\n\nTable 1 reports the number of supernovae counted in each\nsample, with the restrictions on redshift and on discovery\ntime motivated above.\nThe ratio S = N(Ib\u2013Ic)/N(II) for normal galaxies is\n\u22480.23, very close to the values obtained from the ratio of absolute supernova rates in SNu: 0.18 for S0a-Sb galaxies, and\n0.27 for Sbc-Sd galaxies (Cappellaro et al. 1997). The ratio\n\nFigure 1.

S cc,Sy = N (Ib/Ic)/(Ncc , \u2248 0.5 \u226b\nS norm \u2248 0.19, where Ncc = N(Ib) + N(Ic) + N(II) is the\nnumber of core-collapse supernovae. Assumption of binomial\nstatistics, where the probability is p=S cc,norm, yields an excess of type Ib-Ic supernova in the Seyfert sample significant\nto a confidence level of >\n\u223c 2\u03c3 (N(Ib/c) expected in the Seyfert\nsample is 2.3\u00b11.3). However, this simple estimate may not\nbe fully satisfactory, since normal galaxies and Seyfert samples may be influenced by factors affecting the probability of\ndiscovery as well as the intrinsic rate of supernova explosion\n(see \u00a73.3).\n3.2\n\nThe Radial Distribution of Supernovae\n\nFig. 1 shows the distribution of the supernova de-projected\ndistance d\u2217 normalized to the standard isophotal diameter\nD25 , for normal and Seyfert galaxies, computed under the assumptions that all galaxies can be considered flat disks. Supernovae in Seyfert galaxies show a tendency to occur closer\nto the nucleus. A Kolmogorov \u2013 Smirnov test suggests that\nthe distributions are different to a statistical significance of\n0.999. This result has been known for some time (Petrosian\n& Turatto 1990; Kazarian 1997) from the analysis of supernova data in different samples.\n3.3\n\nSignificance of Results: Is there any Real\nExcess of type Ib-Ic Supernovae in Seyfert\ngalaxies?\n\nThe ratio S norm has been determined from 210 type II and\n48 type Ib-Ic supernovae; therefore it is possible to safely\nuse the binomial statistics to write S norm \u2248 0.23 \u00b1 0.05\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fOn Core Collapse Supernovae in Normal and in Seyfert Galaxies\n\n3\n\nFigure 2.

Thick solid lines: without redistribution of unknown and type I supernovae; thin solid line:\nafter redistribition of unknown and type I supernovae. We considered 25 galaxies with vr \u2264 14000km s\u22121 with supernovae discovered in or after 1985. The vertical dot-dashed line marks the\nvalue found for the Seyfert sample, as reported in Table 1.\n\n(at 1 \u03c3 confidence level). To properly estimate the statistical significance of the excess of type Ib-Ic supernovae in\nSeyfert galaxies, we used a \"bootstrap\" method. We generated a large number (\u223c 104 ) of synthetic data sets matching\nthe Seyfert galaxy sample. The synthetic data set were extracted randomly from our normal galaxies samples, with\nthe same number of galaxies as in the Seyfert samples, and\nwith the same distribution of any parameter influencing either the probability of discovery of supernovae, or the intrinsic rate of supernova production (Cappellaro et al. 1993):\n(1) galaxy inclination, (2) D25 , (3) morphological type, (4)\nradial velocity. \"Matching\" samples were considered all synthetic samples for which the four distributions were all not\nstatistically different from the distributions for the Seyfert\nsample at a 2\u03c3 confidence level. In other words, since we\ncould not eliminate selection effects from our Seyfert sample,\nwe reproduced them in a similar fashion in a large number\nof \"pseudo-control samples.\"\nIn all cases save the morphological type, the statistical\ndifference between the parameter distribution of the Seyfert\ngalaxy sample and of same-size samples of normal galaxies\nwas assessed by a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. In the case of\nmorphological type, a \u03c72 test was applied, after rebinning of\nT values into four bins for early type galaxies (E-S0), early\nspirals (S0a-Sb) late type galaxies (Sc and later), and unknown or peculiar. We computed the number of supernovae\nfor each synthetic data set, and then we counted which fraction of synthetic data sets had supernova numbers exceeding\nthe number from the real data. That fraction has been assumed to be our statistical significance (Efron & Tibshirani\n1993).\nFig. 2 the thick solid line shows the distribution of S\nfor the pseudo-control samples. The dot-dashed line marks\nthe value found for the Seyfert sample. Only in \u2248 1 % of\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nFigure 3.

The thin line marks the distribution of supernovae after supernovae whose classification was unknown\nand or of generic type \"I\" have been re-assigned (consistently with the approach of (Petrosian & Turatto 1990)).\nFrom Fig. 2, we infer that the redistribution for unclassified supernova types has a negligible effect on the statistical\nresults.\n\n4\n4.1\n\nINFERENCES ON STAR FORMATION\nNormal Galaxies\n\nThe interpretation of the ratio S for the \"average normal\"\ngalaxy is straightforward, if we consider most likely that Ib/c\nsupernovae progenitors are Wolf Rayet stars, whose hydrogen envelope has been fully lost (Filippenko 1998, and references therein). The latter stars may result from the evolution of the most massive stars (M\u226540M\u2299)(Bressan, Chiosi,\n& Bertelli 1981; Bressan 1994) or from less massive primary\ncomponent of binary systems after the mass transfer (eg.\nTable 2 of (Wellstein & Langer 1999)). Assuming a constant\nstar formation rate during the last 100 Myr, and adopting\n\n\f4\n\nA Bressan et al.\n\nthe same initial mass function (IMF) for single stars and\nbinary components, the ratio S is simply given by\nWi\n\nR mi2\n\n\u03c8(m)dm\n\nWj\nj\n\nR mj2\n\n\u03c8(m)dm\n\nP\n\nS= P\n\ni\n\nmi1\n\nj\n\nm1\n\n(1)\n\nwhere m is the initial mass of the star, the index i refers to\nall channels leading to type Ib/c supernovae, j to the formation of type II supernovae and W's are relative weights that\ndepend on the overall binary fraction and on the relative\nfrequency of case A, B and C in the binary evolution.\nThe expected variation of the ratio S is shown in the\nupper panel of Fig.3, as a function of the binary fraction.\nTo this purpose we have adopted a Salpeter IMF up to\n120 M\u2299, and the values of mi and mj were taken from Table 2 of (Wellstein & Langer 1999); the latter authors also\nassume that all stars more massive than 40 M\u2299 explode as\ntype Ib/c supernovae, while single stars and secondary stars\nless massive than 40 M\u2299 explode as type II supernovae. We\nhave considered several cases: (a) all binaries evolve as Case\nA (dotted line); (b) all binaries evolve as Case B (dashed\nline); (c) Case A and B share the same relative weight (solid\nline); (d) as in (c) but in the case that only binary members explode as type Ib/c supernovae (lower dot long-dashed\nline); (e) as in (c) but in this case the initial mass for Ib/c\nsupernovae has been lowered from 40 M\u2299 to 25 M\u2299 (upper dot short-dashed line). The horizontal line represents\nthe observed average value for the normal galaxy sample\n(CS). We did not account for Case C evolution because it is\nconsidered to be a very rare event and as such it will only\nslightly modify the picture depicted in Fig.3. The fraction\nS does not appear much affected by the precise details of\nthe binary evolution. For normal spirals, the observed ratio is consistent with a scenario where the progenitors of\ntype Ib/c supernovae are Wolf Rayet stars, either evolved\nfrom stars initially more massive than 40 M\u2299 or from less\nmassive primary components of binary systems. The data\nsupport a universal Salpeter IMF and indicate a binary fraction of about the 50%. A significantly higher binary fraction\n(about 75%) is required if one insists that only binary evolution give rise to type Ib/c supernovae. As discussed by\nWellstein & Langer (1999), uncertainties in the mass- loss\nrate, convection treatment and chemical composition may\naffect both the upper mass limit (40 M\u2299) leading to type\nII supernovae in single stars, and the mass transfer phase in\nbinary evolution. Fortunately, uncertainties leading to different type Ib and type Ic supernovae events are not relevant\nhere, because we are considering their combined frequency.\n\n4.2\n\nSeyfert Galaxies\n\nFrom Table 1 and Fig.3, we also infer that things could be\nmarkedly different in Seyfert galaxies, where the observed\nratio is S\u22481. Several Seyfert galaxies, of which a sizable\nfraction belongs to strongly interacting systems (?; DultzinHacyan et al. 1999, \u2248 2/3 of Seyfert 2), show significant, or\neven dominant (over the active nucleus luminosity) circumnuclear star formation. A recent H\u03b1 narrow band survey\n(Gonz\u00e1lez-Delgado, Heckman, & Leitherer 2001) found that\nabout 1/2 of Seyfert 1 and Seyfert 2 show maximum value of\nHii region emission in the circum-nuclear regions. This study\n\nof the radial distribution of Hii regions in normal, LINER\nand Seyfert galaxies agrees with a large number of detailed\nspectroscopic and imaging studies of Seyfert galaxies. Consistently, the radial distribution of supernovae appears to\nbe more strongly peaked in Seyfert galaxies than in normal\ngalaxies in several samples (Kazarian 1997; Petrosian & Turatto 1990) as well as in our own. However, enhancement\nof star formation rate in the inner galactic regions cannot\nexplain the relative excess of type Ib/c supernovae found in\nSeyfert galaxies.\nThe observed radial gradients of chemical composition\n(Vila-Costas & Edmunds 1992) and the central concentration of type Ib/c supernovae in Seyfert galaxies (Fig. 1) imply that Ib/c supernovae could be typically produced in 2\nZ\u2299 regions in Seyfert and in Z\u2299 regions in normal galaxies. Because mass loss increases with metallicity and, consequently, the minimum initial mass for single Wolf Rayet\nproduction decreases, S could be a function of metallicity.\nAs shown by model (d) in the upper panel of Fig.3, S could\nincrease by the 100% if the minimum mass for Ib/c production decreases from 40 M\u2299 to 25 M\u2299 . However, this is not\nvery likely because mass-loss is also sensitive to the luminosity and the latter is a strong function of the initial mass\n(Bressan 1994).\nAnother possible explanation is that star formation in\ncircum-nuclear and disk regions of Seyfert galaxies is a high\nbinary fraction. If we assume that all young stars are in binaries and undergo mass transfer during their life, we would\nobtain S\u22430.6. This value, though lower than the observed\none, would double the expected relative frequency of binary\nstars with respect to the normal galaxies. Inspection of Table\n1 shows that the observed ratio N(Ia)/Ncc is 0.63 for the normal galaxies and rises to 1 in the Seyfert sample. Would this\nratio be free from selection effects, it would strongly indicate\na larger probability of assembling binary systems. However,\nthe magnitude at maximum and light-curve of type Ia supernovae is very different from that of core-collapse supernovae.\nThis makes the comparison of the ratio N(Ia) over number\nof core-collapse supernovae meaningless if not accompanied\nby a careful examination of the relative control times which,\nunfortunately cannot be done here.\nAn appealing alternative is constituted by a \"toploaded\" IMF. The high efficiency at which gas is reprocessed into stars is often taken as an indication in favor\nof a top-heavy initial mass function in compact Starbursts\ne.g. (Franceschini 1999). The middle panel of Fig. 3 depicts the effect of changing the IMF exponent x, where\n\u03c8(m) \u221d m\u2212(1+x) and x=1.35 corresponds to the Salpeter\nIMF. The value of S increases as the IMF becomes flatter.\nThe observed value in Seyfert galaxies would indicate a very\nflat IMF, above 8 M\u2299 . We must however stress that conclusive evidence in favor of an IMF slope significantly flatter\nthan the Salpeter one has not been found in external galaxies, not even in Wolf-Rayet and Starburst galaxies (Schaerer,\nContini, & Kunth 1999; Leitherer(1999)).\nThe necessity of a top heavy IMF disappears if, in\nSeyferts, we are observing a very young burst of star formation. To illustrate this effect we show in the lower panel\nof Fig.3 the run of the ratio S with the binary fraction, for\ndifferent burst ages and a constant SFR. If the starburst is\n>\nsufficiently old, let us say of age \u03c4 \u22c6 \u223c\n50 Myr, then there\nmay exist evolved stars with any mass between the upper\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fOn Core Collapse Supernovae in Normal and in Seyfert Galaxies\nIMF limit and the critical mass M\u22438 M\u2299 for core collapse\nsupernovae. But if the burst is younger, then all stars with\ninitial mass below a given value \u2013 M(\u03c4 ) \u2013 are still on the\nMain Sequence and only stars more massive than M(\u03c4 \u22c6 )\ncan explode. Different curves in the lower panel of Fig. 3 are\nlabeled by the duration of the burst, in Myr. A Salpeter IMF\nis consistent with the observed S Seyf if the star formation\nepisode is younger than \u2248 13 Myr. This value depends only\nslightly on the assumed chemical composition.\n\n5\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe found that normal galaxies show S norm \u22480.27, a value\nconsistent with the ratio of absolute supernova rates in SNu.\nWith the caveat of our still-limited sample size, Seyfert\ngalaxies show a peculiar distribution of supernova types,\nwith higher frequency of type Ib/c supernovae (S Seyf \u2248 1)\nthan non-active galaxies. These finding are consistent with a\n\"normal\" supernova rate related to secular star formation as\nfar as non-active galaxies are concerned. A scenario where\nWolf Rayet stars are produced by the most massive stars\n(\u226540M\u2299 ) and by less massive (8M\u2299 \u2264M\u226440M\u2299 ) primary\nstars of binary systems that soon or later undergo masstransfer, reproduces fairly well the observed ratio, without\nparticular assumptions on the IMF.\nA large type Ib/c rate with respect to type II supernovae, as found for Seyferts, is a new result. We consider\nseveral explanations as possible, namely a lowering of the\nupper mass limit for type II precursors due to a higher metallicity, a very high binary fraction, a top heavy IMF and a\nyoung age of the burst of star formation. While metallicity\nis likely to act in the observed direction, because it enhances\nthe mass-loss rate, the amplitude of the observed effect may\nnot be explained.\nEven if the S value found for Seyfert galaxies needs\nconfirmation with better statistics, it is interesting to note\nthat an high S could be associated with the enhanced SFR\nin the circum-nuclear and regions of galaxies hosting Seyfert\nnuclei, especially of type 2 nuclei (Dultzin-Hacyan(1995)). A\nyoung age of the burst of star formation \u2013 probably triggered\nby interaction with a massive companion galaxy (DultzinHacyan et al. 1999) \u2013 is a likely cause of the high S observed\namong Seyfert galaxies, as it requires the minor number of\nassumptions. This interpretation is also consistent with an\nevolutionary sequence leading from IR-luminous Starbursts,\nto Seyfert 2 and eventually to Seyfert 1 galaxies, with the\nyoungest Seyfert 1 being the ones of lowest intrinsic power\nand/or the ones most heavily obscured (Gu, Maiolino, &\nDultzin-Hacyan 2001).\nAB thanks the Osservatorio di Collurania at Teramo\n(Italy) for their hospitality.
