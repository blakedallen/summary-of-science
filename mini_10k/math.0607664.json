A good illustration of this analogy\nis the construction of minimal Kac-Moody groups over arbitrary fields, due to J. Tits [Tit87], by\nmeans of presentations generalizing in infinite dimension the so-called Steinberg presentations of\nChevalley groups over fields [Ste68]. This presentation provides not only a Kac-Moody group G, but\nalso a family of root subgroups (U\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208\u03a6 indexed by an abstract root system \u03a6 and satisfying a list\nof properties shared by the system of root groups of any isotropic semisimple algebraic group. These\nproperties constitute the group theoretic counterpart of the geometric notion of a twin building:\nany group endowed with such a family of root groups, which is called a twin root datum, has a\nnatural diagonal action on a product of two buildings, and this action preserves a twinning. We\nrefer to [Tit92] and [R\u00e9m02b] for this combinatorial point of view.\nIn this paper, we are mainly interested in finitely generated Kac-Moody groups, i.e. minimal\nKac-Moody groups over finite ground fields. In this special situation, it has been noticed more\nrecently that another viewpoint, different from the aforementioned algebraic group theoretic one,\nis especially relevant: the arithmetic group viewpoint. The striking feature which justifies in the\nfirst place this more recent analogy is the fact that finitely generated Kac-Moody groups embed\nas irreducible lattices in the product of closed automorphism groups of the associated buildings,\nprovided the ground field is sufficiently large, see [R\u00e9m99]. A sufficient condition for this is that\nthe order of the finite ground field is at least the number of canonical generators of the Weyl group.\nIn fact, Kac-Moody theory is one of the few known sources of examples of irreducible lattices in\nproducts of locally compact groups outside the classical world of lattices in higher-rank Lie groups.\nOn the other hand, the intersection between Kac-Moody groups and arithmetic groups is nonempty\nDate: November 10, 2018.\n\u2217\nF.N.R.S. research fellow.\n1\n\n\fsince Kac-Moody groups of affine type, namely those obtained by evaluating Chevalley group\nschemes over rings of Laurent polynomials, are indeed arithmetic groups. A standard example,\n\u22121\nwhich is good to keep\n\u0001 in mind, is\u22121the\u0001 arithmetic group SLn (Fq [t, t ]), which is an irreducible\nlattice of SLn Fq ((t)) \u00d7 SLn Fq ((t )) . This arithmetic group analogy, suggesting the existence\nof strong similarities between Kac-Moody groups of arbitrary type and the previous examples of\naffine type, is supported by several other results, see e.g. [Abr96] for finiteness properties, [DJ02]\nfor continuous cohomology, [RR06, \u00a71] for some structural properties, etc.\nThe main result of the present paper shows that for infinite Kac-Moody groups over finite fields,\nthere is a sharp structural contrast between affine and non-affine groups. Indeed, affine Kac-Moody\ngroups over finite fields, as finitely generated linear groups, are residually finite. On the other hand,\nnon-affine Kac-Moody groups are submitted to the following:\nSimplicity theorem (Kac-Moody version). Let \u039b be a split or almost split Kac-Moody group\nover a finite field Fq . Assume that the Weyl group W of \u039b is an irreducible, infinite and non-affine\nCoxeter group. Then every finite index subgroup of \u039b contains the derived subgroup [\u039b, \u039b], which is\nof finite index. Assume moreover that q \u2265 |S|. Then the group [\u039b, \u039b], divided by its finite center,\nis simple.\nA more general result (Theorem 19 of Subsect. 4.4) holds in the abstract framework of twin root\ndata; it was announced in [CR06].\nIt follows from the above that for any neither spherical nor affine, indecomposable generalized\nCartan matrix A of size n, there exists a Kac-Moody group functor GA such that for any finite\nfield Fq with q \u2265 n > 2, the group \u039b = GA (Fq ), divided by its finite center, is an infinite finitely\ngenerated simple group. We also note that this simplicity result for Kac-Moody groups over finite\nfields implies strong non-linearity properties for Kac-Moody groups over arbitrary fields of positive\ncharacteristic (Theorem 24). To be more constructive, we add the following corollary (see Corollary\n21). As pointed out to us by Y. Shalom, we obtain the first infinite finitely presented discrete groups\nto be both simple and Kazhdan.\nSimple Kazhdzan group corollary. If the generalized Cartan matrix A is 2\u2013spherical (i.e. every\n2 \u00d7 2\u2013submatrix is of spherical type) and if q > 1764n , then the group \u039b/Z(\u039b) is finitely presented,\nsimple and Kazhdan. Moreover there exist infinitely many isomorphism classes of infinite groups\nwith these three properties.\nAnother consequence is the possibility to exhibit a large family of inclusions of lattices in topological\ngroups for which the density of the commensurator does not hold (see Corollary 17).\nNon-arithmeticity corollary. Let \u039b be a split or almost split Kac-Moody group over a finite field\nFq . Assume that the Weyl group of \u039b is irreducible, infinite and non-affine. Let B+ , B\u2212 be the\nbuildings associated with \u039b and let \u039b+ and \u039b\u2212 be the respective closures of the images of the natural\nactions \u039b \u2192 Aut(B+ ) and \u039b \u2192 Aut(B\u2212 ). We view \u039b/Z(\u039b)\n\u0001 as a diagonally embedded subgroup of\n\u039b\u2212 \u00d7 \u039b+ . Then the commensurator Comm\u039b\u2212 \u00d7\u039b+ \u039b/Z(\u039b) contains \u039b as a finite index subgroup;\nin particular it is discrete.\nThe proof of the above theorem follows a two\u2013step strategy which owes much to a general approach\ninitiated by M. Burger and Sh. Mozes [BM01b] to construct simple groups as cocompact lattices\nin products of two trees; however, the details of arguments are often substantially different. The\nidea of [BM01b] is to prove the normal subgroup property (i.e. normal subgroups either are finite\nand central or have finite index) following G. A. Margulis' proof for lattices in higher rank Lie\ngroups [Mar91, VIII.2] but to disprove residual finiteness by geometric arguments in suitable cases\n[BM01b, Proposition 2.1]. This relies on a preliminary study of sufficiently transitive groups of\n2\n\n\ftree automorphisms [BM01a]. Let us also recall that a finitely generated just infinite group (i.e.\nall of whose proper quotients are finite) is either residually finite or is, up to finite index, a direct\nproduct of finitely many isomorphic simple groups [Wil71].\nIn our situation, the first step of the proof, i.e. the normal subgroup property, had been established\nin previous papers, in collaboration with U. Bader and Y. Shalom: [BS06], [R\u00e9m05] and [Sha00].\nThis fact, which is recalled here as Theorem 18, is one of the main results supporting the analogy\nwith arithmetic groups mentioned above. One difference with [BM01b, Theorem 4.1] is that the\nproof does not rely on the Howe\u2013Moore property (i.e. decay of matrix coefficients). Instead,\nY. Shalom and U. Bader use cohomology with unitary coefficients and Poisson boundaries. In fact,\nit can be seen that closed strongly transitive automorphism groups of buildings do not enjoy Howe\u2013\nMoore property in general: whenever the ambient closed automorphism group of the buildings in\nconsideration contains a proper parabolic subgroup which is not of spherical type (i.e. whose\nWeyl subgroup is infinite), then any such parabolic subgroup is an open subgroup which is neither\ncompact nor of finite index.\nThe second half of the simplicity proof does not actually use the notion of residual finiteness.\nInstead, it establishes severe restrictions on the existence of finite quotients of a group endowed\nwith a twin root datum of non-affine type (Theorem 15). Here, one confronts the properties of the\nsystem of root subgroups to a geometric criterion which distinguishes between the Tits cones of\naffine (i.e. virtually abelian) and of non-affine Coxeter groups (see [MV00] and [NV02] for another\nillustration of this fact). This part of the arguments holds without any restriction on the ground\nfield, and holds in particular for those groups over tiny fields for which simplicity is still an open\nquestion.\nWe note that the simplicity theorem above is thus obtained as the combination of two results which\npertain respectively to each of the two analogies mentioned above. In this respect, it seems that\nthe structure of Kac-Moody groups is enriched by the ambiguous nature of these groups, which are\nsimultaneously arithmetic-group-like and algebraic-group-like.\nIn order to conclude the presentation of our simplicity results, let us compare quickly Burger-Mozes'\ngroups with simple Kac-Moody lattices. The groups constructed thanks to [BM01b, Theorem 5.5]\nare cocompact lattices in a product of two trees; they are always finitely presented, simple, torsion\nfree and amalgams of free groups (hence cannot have property (T)). Simple Kac-Moody lattices\nare non-uniform lattices of products of buildings, possibly (and usually) of dimension \u2265 2; they are\noften (not always, though) finitely presented and Kazhdan and contain infinite subgroups of finite\nexponent. It is still an open and challenging question to construct simple cocompact lattices in\nhigher-dimensional buildings.\nWe now turn to the second series of results of this paper. It deals with restrictions on actions of\nKac-Moody lattices on various non-positively curved spaces. This is a natural question with respect\nto the previous results in view of the following known fact: a non residually finite group cannot be\nembedded nontrivially into a compact group (see Proposition 25). In particular a simple Kazhdan\ngroup acting non-trivially on a Gromov-hyperbolic proper metric space Y of bounded geometry\ncannot fix any point in the visual compactification Y = Y \u2294\u2202\u221e Y . This is where superrigidity results\ncome into play since they provide even stronger restrictions on actions: a finitely generated group\nof Kac-Moody type is naturally a lattice for a product of two locally compact totally disconnected\ngroups. The latter groups are strongly transitive closed automorphism groups of buildings and as\nsuch have a BN -pair structure.\nTherefore, it makes sense to try to use the recent superrigidity results due to N. Monod [Mon06]\nand to T. Gelander, A. Karlsson and G. Margulis [GKM06]. As for Y. Shalom's result on property\n3\n\n\f(T) [Sha00], the non-cocompactness of Kac-Moody lattices is an obstruction to a plain application\nof these results (stated for uniform lattices). Still, all the previous references propose measuretheoretic or representation-theoretic substitutes for cocompactness. Although weak cocompactness\nof Kac-Moody groups is still open, we prove a substitute proposed in [GKM06] (see Theorem 30).\nUniform integrability theorem. Let \u039b be a split or almost split Kac-Moody group over Fq .\nAssume that \u039b is a lattice of the product of its twinned buildings B\u00b1 . Then the group \u039b admits a\nnatural fundamental domain with respect to which it is uniformly p\u2013integrable for any p \u2208 [1; +\u221e).\nFor an arbitrary inclusion of a finitely generated lattice \u0393 in a locally compact group G, uniform\nintegrability is a technical condition requiring the existence of a fundamental domain D with respect\nto which some associated cocycle is uniformly integrable (see Subsect. 7.2); it ensures the existence\nof harmonic maps [GKM06]. Here is an example of an available superrigidity statement [GKM06,\nTheorem 1.1].\nSuperrigidity corollary. Let \u039b be as above; in particular it is a lattice of the product of its two\ncompletions \u039b\u2212 \u00d7\u039b+ . Let X be a complete Busemann non-positively curved uniformly convex metric\nspace without nontrivial Clifford isometries. We assume that there exists a \u039b-action by isometries\non X with reduced unbounded image. Then the \u039b-action extends uniquely to a \u039b\u2212 \u00d7 \u039b+ -action\nwhich factors through \u039b\u2212 or \u039b+ .\nThe relevancy of reduced actions was pointed out in [Mon06]: a subgroup L < Isom(X) is called\nreduced if there is no unbounded closed convex proper subset Y of X such that gY is at finite\nHausdorff distance from Y for any g \u2208 L. We also recall that a Clifford isometry of X is a\nsurjective isometry T : X \u2192 X such that x 7\u2192 d(T (x), x) is constant on X.\nThese results about continuous extensions of group homomorphisms call for structure results for\nthe geometric completions \u039b\u00b1 of Kac-Moody groups over finite fields, i.e. the closures of the nondiscrete \u039b-actions on each building B\u00b1 . Indeed, once a continuous extension has been obtained by\nsuperrigidity, it is highly desirable to determine whether this map is proper, e.g. to know whether\ninfinite discrete subgroups can have a global fixed point in the target metric space. When the\nambient topological groups are semisimple Lie groups, the properness comes as a consequence of\nthe Cartan decomposition of such groups [BM96, Lemma 5.3]. The difficulty in our situation is\nthat, with respect to structure properties, topological groups of Kac-Moody type are not as nice\nas semisimple algebraic groups over local fields. Unless the Kac-Moody group is of affine type,\nthere is no Cartan decomposition in which double cosets modulo a maximal compact subgroup are\nindexed by an abelian semi-group: the Weyl group is not virtually abelian and roots cannot be put\ninto finitely many subsets according to parallelism classes of walls in the Coxeter complex. This is\nanother avatar of the strong Tits alternative for infinite Coxeter groups [MV00], [NV02]. Here is a\nslightly simplified version of our main properness result (Theorem 27).\nProperness theorem. Let \u039b be a split or almost split simply connected Kac-Moody group over Fq\nand let \u039b+ be its positive topological completion. Then any nontrivial continuous homomorphism\n\u03c6 : \u039b+ \u2192 G to a locally compact second countable group G is proper.\nAs an example of application of superrigidity results, we study actions on Kac-Moody lattices on\nCAT(\u22121)-spaces. In this specific case, the most appropriate results available are the superrigidity\ntheorems of N. Monod and Y. Shalom [MS04]. Putting these together with the abstract simplicity\nof non-affine Kac-Moody lattices and the properness theorem above enables us to exhibit strong\nincompatibilities between higher-rank Kac-Moody groups and some negatively curved metric spaces\n(see Theorem 33 for more details).\n4\n\n\fHigher-rank versus CAT(\u22121) ii theorem. Let \u039b be a simple Kac-Moody lattice and Y be a\nproper CAT(\u22121)-space with cocompact isometry group. If the buildings B\u00b1 of \u039b contain flat subspaces of dimension \u2265 2 and if \u039b is Kazhdan, then the group \u039b admits no nontrivial action by\nisometries on Y .\nhh\n\nWe show below, by means of a specific example, that the assumption that Isom(Y ) is cocompact\nis necessary (see the remark following Theorem 33). This theorem was motivated by [BM96,\nCorollary 0.5]. Note that we made two assumptions (one on flat subspaces, one on property (T))\nwhich, in the classical case, are implied by the same algebraic condition. Namely, if \u039b were an\nirreducible lattice in a product of semisimple algebraic groups, and if each algebraic group were of\nsplit rank \u2265 2, then both hh higher-rank ii assumptions would be fulfilled. In the Kac-Moody case,\nthere is no connection between existence of flats in the building and property (T). The relevant\nrank here is the geometric one (the one involving flats in the buildings). According to [BRW05] and\n[CH06], it has a more abstract interpretation relevant to the general theory of totally disconnected\nlocally compact groups.\nThe proofs of most results of the present paper use in a very soft way that the construction of\nthe lattices considered in this introduction pertains to Kac-Moody theory. The actual tool which\nis the most natural framework for our arguments is the notion of a twin root datum introduced\nin [Tit92]. It turns out that the class of groups endowed with a twin root datum includes split and\nalmost split Kac-Moody groups only as a (presumably small) subfamily (see \u00a71 below). Several\nexotic constructions of such groups outside the strict Kac-Moody framework are known, see e.g.\n[Tit90, \u00a79] for groups acting on twin trees, [RR06] for groups acting on right-angled twin buildings\nand [M\u00fch99] for groups obtained by integration of Moufang foundations. All these examples are\ndiscrete subgroups of the product of the automorphism groups of the two halves of a twin building,\nwhich are actually mostly of finite covolume. These lattices, called twin building lattices, constitute\nthe main object of study for the rest of this paper.\nStructure of the paper. In the preliminary Sect. 0, we fix the conventions and notation. Sect. 1\nis devoted to collect some basic results for later reference. Although these results are often stated\nin the strict Kac-Moody framework in the literature, we have been careful to state and prove them\nin the context of twin building lattices. Sect. 2 introduces a fixed-point property of root subgroups\nand it is shown that most examples of twin building lattices enjoy this property. It is then used\nto establish several useful structural properties of these completions. In Sect. 3, we prove the\nmain fact needed for the simplicity theorem; it is the existence of a weakly hyperbolic geometric\nconfiguration of walls for non-affine infinite Coxeter complexes. In Sect. 4, the simplicity theorem\nis proved together with very strong restrictions on quotients of the groups for which the simplicity\nis still unknown. In Sect. 5, we prove a non-linearity property for Kac-Moody groups over arbitrary\nfields of positive characteristic. In Sect. 6, we study homomorphisms from Kac-Moody groups to\narbitrary locally compact groups; the main part of this section deals with the geometric completions\nof Kac-Moody groups, more precisely it establishes that any nontrivial continuous homomorphism\non must be proper. In Sect. 7, we prove that Kac-Moody groups enjoy the uniform integrability\ncondition required by Gelander-Karlsson-Margulis to derive superrigidity statements; restrictions\non actions on hyperbolic metric spaces in terms of hh rank ii are derived from this.\nAcknowledgements.

Notation and general references\nLet us fix some notation, conventions and make explicit our standard references.\n0.1. About Coxeter groups. Throughout this paper, (W, S) denotes a Coxeter system [Bou81,\nIV.1] of finite rank (i.e. with S finite) and l or lS denotes the word length W \u2192 N with\nP respect\nto the generating set S. We denote by W (t) the canonical growth series, i.e. the series n\u22650 cn tn\nwhere cn is the number of elements w \u2208 W such that lS (w) = n. The combinatorial root system\n\u03a6 of W is abstractly defined in [Tit87, Sect. 5]. We adopt this point of view because, since it is\npurely set-theoretic, it is useful to connect several geometric realizations of the Coxeter complex of\n(W, S) [Bro98], [Ron89]. A pair of opposite roots here is a pair of complementary subsets W which\nare permuted by a suitable conjugate of some canonical generator s \u2208 S. The set of simple roots is\ndenoted by \u03a0.\nT\nT\nRecall that a set of roots \u03a8 is called prenilpotent if both intersections \u03b1\u2208\u03a8 \u03b1 and \u03b1\u2208\u03a8 \u2212\u03b1 are\nnonempty. Given a prenilpotent pair {\u03b1, \u03b2} \u2282 \u03a6, we set\n[\u03b1, \u03b2] := {\u03b3 \u2208 \u03a6 | \u03b1 \u2229 \u03b2 \u2282 \u03b3 and (\u2212\u03b1) \u2229 (\u2212\u03b2) \u2282 \u2212\u03b3}.\n0.2. About geometric realizations. We denote by A the Davis complex associated to (W, S)\nand by d the corresponding CAT(0) distance on A [Dav98]. The metric space A is obtained as\na gluing of compact subsets, all isometric to one another and called chambers. The group W acts\nproperly discontinuously on A and simply transitively on the chambers. The fixed point set of\neach reflection, i.e. of each element of the form wsw\u22121 for some s \u2208 S and w \u2208 W , separates A\ninto two disjoint halves, the closures of which are called root half-spaces. The fixed point set of\na reflection is called a wall. The set of root half-spaces of A is denoted by \u03a6(A ); it is naturally\nin W \u2013equivariant bijection with \u03a6. We distinguish a base chamber, say c+ , which we call the\nstandard chamber: it corresponds to 1W in the above free W -action. We denote by \u03a6+ the set of\nroot half-spaces containing c+ and by \u03a0 the set of simple roots, i.e. of positive roots bounded by\na wall associated to some s \u2208 S.\n0.3. About group combinatorics. The natural abstract framework in which the main results\nof this paper hold is provided by the notion of a twin root datum, which was introduced in [Tit92]\nand is further discussed for instance in [Abr96, \u00a71] or [R\u00e9m02b, 1.5]. A twin root datum consists\nof a couple (G, {U\u03b1 }\u03b1\u2208\u03a6 ) where G is a group and {U\u03b1 }\u03b1\u2208\u03a6 is a collection of subgroups indexed by\nthe combinatorial root system of some Coxeter system;\nT the subgroups {U\u03b1 }\u03b1\u2208\u03a6 , called root groups,\nare submitted to the following axioms, where T := \u03b1\u2208\u03a6 NG (U\u03b1 ) and U+ (resp. U\u2212 ) denotes the\nsubgroup generated by the root groups indexed by the positive roots (resp. their opposites):\n(TRD0): For each \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a6, we have U\u03b1 6= {1}.\n(TRD1): For each prenilpotent pair {\u03b1, \u03b2} \u2282 \u03a6, the commutator group [U\u03b1 , U\u03b2 ] is contained\nin the group U]\u03b1,\u03b2[ := hU\u03b3 | \u03b3 \u2208]\u03b1, \u03b2[i.\n(TRD2): For each \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a0 and each u \u2208 U\u03b1 \\{1}, there exists elements u\u2032 , u\u2032\u2032 \u2208 U\u2212\u03b1 such that\nthe product m(u) := u\u2032 uu\u2032\u2032 conjugates U\u03b2 onto Us\u03b1 (\u03b2) for each \u03b2 \u2208 \u03a6.\n(TRD3): For each \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a0, the group U\u2212\u03b1 is not contained in U+ and the group U\u03b1 is not\ncontained in U\u2212 .\n(TRD4): G = T hU\u03b1 | \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a6i.\nWe also set N := T.hm(u) | u \u2208 U\u03b1 \u2212 {1}, \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a0i. A basic fact is that the subquotient N/T is\nisomorphic to W ; we call it the Weyl group of G.\n6\n\n\f0.4. About twin buildings. The geometric counterpart to twin root data is the notion of twin\nbuildings. Some references are [Tit92], [Abr96, \u00a72] or [R\u00e9m02b, \u00a72.5]. Roughly speaking, a group\nwith a twin root datum {U\u03b1 }\u03b1\u2208\u03a6 of type (W, S) admits two structures of BN \u2013pairs which are\nnot conjugate to one another in general. Let (B+ , B\u2212 ) be the associated twinned buildings; their\napartments are modelled on the Coxeter complex of (W, S). We will not need the combinatorial\nnotion of a twinning between B\u2212 and B+ . The standard twin apartment (resp. standard positive\nchamber) is denoted by (A+ , A\u2212 ) (resp. c+ ). We identify the Davis complex A with the positive\napartment A+ . With this identification and when the root groups are all finite, the buildings B\u00b1\nare locally finite CAT(0) cell complexes.\n\n1. Twin building lattices and their topological completions\nAs mentioned in the introduction, the main results of this paper apply not only to split or almost\nsplit Kac-Moody groups over finite fields, but also to the larger class of groups endowed with a\ntwin root datum with finite root groups. Some existing results in the literature are stated for split\nor almost split Kac-Moody groups, but remain actually valid in this more general context of twin\nroot data. The purpose of this section is to collect some of these results and to restate them in this\ncontext for subsequent references.\n1.1. Kac-Moody groups versus groups with a twin root datum. Although the notion of\na twin root datum was initially designed as an appropriate tool to study Kac-Moody groups, it\nbecame rapidly clear that many examples of twin root data arise beyond the strict scope of KacMoody theory. This stands in sharp contrast to the finite-dimensional situation: as follows from\nthe classification achieved in [Tit74] (see also [TW02]), any group endowed with a twin root datum\nwith finite Weyl group of rank at least 3 and of irreducible type is associated (in a way which we\nwill not make precise) with some isotropic simple algebraic group over a field or with a classical\ngroup over a (possibly skew) field. Here is a list of known constructions which yields examples of\ntwin root data with infinite Weyl group but not associated with split or almost split Kac-Moody\ngroups:\n(I) [Tit90, \u00a79] constructs a twin root datum with infinite dihedral Weyl group and arbitrary\nprescribed rank one Levi factors. The possibility of mixing ground fields prevent these\ngroups from being of hh Kac-Moody origin ii . The associated buildings are one-dimensional,\ni.e. trees.\n(II) In [RR06], the previous construction is generalized to the case of Weyl groups which are arbitrary right-angled Coxeter groups. In particular, the associated buildings are of arbitrarily\nlarge dimension.\n(III) Opposite to right-angled Coxeter groups are 2\u2013spherical Coxeter groups, i.e. those Coxeter\ngroups in which every pair of canonical generators generates a finite group. Twin root data\nwith 2\u2013spherical Weyl group are submitted to strong structural restrictions (see [MR95])\nshowing in particular that wild constructions as in the right-angled case are impossible.\nFor instance, the following fact is a consequence of the main result of [M\u00fch99]: a group\n\u039b endowed with a twin root datum {U\u03b1 }\u03b1\u2208\u03a6 of irreducible type, such that the root groups\nare all finite of order > 3 and generate \u039b, and that every rank 2 parabolic subgroup is of\ntype A1 \u00d7 A1 , A2 , B2 , C2 or G2 must be a split or almost split Kac-Moody group in the\nsense of [R\u00e9m02b]. Furthermore, it was mentioned to us by B. M\u00fchlherr, as a non-obvious\nstrengthening of [M\u00fch99], that the preceding statement remains true if one allows the rank 2\nsubgroups to be twisted Chevalley groups of rank 2, with the exception of the Ree groups\n7\n\n\f2F .\n4\n\nOn the other hand, the theory developed in [M\u00fch99] allows to obtain twin root data\nby integrating arbitrary Moufang foundations of 2\u2013spherical type. The groups obtained in\nthis way are not Kac-Moody groups whenever the foundation contains a Moufang octagon\n(which corresponds to a rank 2 parabolic subgroup which is of type 2 F4 ).\n\nThe conventions adopted throughout the rest of this section are the following: we let (W, S) be a\nCoxeter system with root system \u03a6 and (\u039b, {U\u03b1 }\u03b1\u2208\u03a6 ) be a twin root datum of type (W, S). We\nassume that each root group is finite and that W is infinite. The associated twin buildings are\ndenoted (B+ , B\u2212 ). The groups Aut(B\u00b1 ) are endowed with the compact-open topology, which\nmakes them locally compact totally disconnected second countable topological groups. We also\nconsider the subgroups T, N, U+ , U\u2212 of \u039b defined in \u00a70.3. The normal subgroup generated by\nall root groups is denoted \u039b\u2020 . If g \u2208 \u039b fixes the building B+ it fixes in particular the standard\npositive apartment and its unique opposite in B\u2212 [Abr96, Lemma 2] since g preserves the twinning;\ntherefore we have: g \u2208 T by [R\u00e9m02b, Corollaire 3.5.4]. Moreover by the Moufang parametrization\n(by means of root group actions) of chambers having a panel in the standard apartment, such a g\nmust centralize each root group. This argument shows that the kernel of the action of \u039b on B+\n(resp. B\u2212 ) is the centralizer Z\u039b (\u039b\u2020 ) and is contained in T .\n1.2. Topological completions: the building topology. For \u01eb \u2208 {+, \u2212}, let \u039beff\n\u01eb be the image\neff\n\u2020\neff\nof the natural homomorphism \u03c0\u01eb : \u039b \u2192 Aut(B\u01eb ). Thus \u039b+ \u2243 \u039b/Z\u039b (\u039b ) \u2243 \u039b\u2212 . The closure\neff\n\n\u039b+ \u2264 Aut(B+ ) is the topological completion considered in [RR06]. In the Kac-Moody case,\nanother approach was proposed in [CG99], using the so-called weight topology; this allows to\nobtain completions of \u039b without taking the effective quotient. However, the weight topology is\ndefined using Kac-Moody algebras and, hence, does not have an obvious substitute in the abstract\nframework considered here. Therefore, we propose the following.\nFor each non-negative integer n, let K\u01ebn be the T\npointwise stabilizer in U\u01eb of the ball of\nT B\u01eb ncentered\n\u2020\nn\nat c\u01eb and of combinatorial radius n. Clearly n K\u01eb \u2282 Z\u039b (\u039b ) \u2282 T and, hence, n K\u01eb = {1}\nbecause T \u2229 U\u01eb = {1} by [R\u00e9m02b, Theorem 3.5.4]. Define a map f\u01eb : \u039b \u00d7 \u039b \u2192 R+ as follows:\n\u001a\n\u001b\n2\nif g\u22121 h 6\u2208 U\u01eb ,\nf\u01eb (g, h) =\n.\nexp(\u2212 max{n | g\u22121 h \u2208 K\u01ebn }) if g\u22121 h \u2208 U\u01eb .\nSince K\u01ebn is a group for each n, it follows that f\u01eb is a left-invariant ultrametric distance on \u039b. We\nlet \u039b\u01eb be the completion of \u039b with respect to this metric [Bou71, II.3.7 Th\u00e9or\u00e8me 3 and III.3.4\nTh\u00e9or\u00e8me 3.4]; this is the topological completion that we consider in this paper.\nDefinition. The so-obtained topology is called the building topology on \u039b\u01eb .\nBy left-invariance of the metric, replacing U\u01eb and c\u01eb by \u039b\u2013conjugates leads to the same topology.\nHere is a summary of some of its basic properties; similar results hold with the signs + and \u2212\ninterchanged.\nProposition 1. We have the following:\n(i) The group \u039b+ is locally compact and totally disconnected for the above topology. It is second\ncountable whenever \u039b is countable, i.e. whenever so is T .\n(ii) The canonical map \u03c0+ : \u039b \u2192 \u039beff\n+ has a unique extension to a continuous surjective open\neff\n\nhomomorphism \u03c0 + : \u039b+ \u2192 \u039b+ .\n(iii) The kernel of \u03c0 + is the discrete subgroup Z\u039b (\u039b\u2020 ) < \u039b+ .\n(iv) We have Stab\u039b+ (c+ ) \u2243 T \u22c9 U + , where U + denotes the closure of U+ in \u039b+ .\n(v) Every element g \u2208 \u039b+ may be written in a unique way as a product g = u+ nu\u2212 , with\nu+ \u2208 U + , n \u2208 N and u\u2212 \u2208 U\u2212 .\n8\n\n\f(vi) The sextuple (\u039b+ , N, U + , U\u2212 , T, S) is a refined Tits system, as defined in [KP85].\neff\n\nRemark. It follows from (ii) and (iii) that the canonical map \u039b+ /Z\u039b (\u039b\u2020 ) \u2192 \u039b+ is an isomorphism\nof topological groups.\nProof. We start by noting that the restriction \u03c0+ |U+ is injective since Z\u039b (\u039b\u2020 ) \u2229 U\u01eb = {1} by\n[R\u00e9m02b, Th\u00e9or\u00e8me 3.5.4]. Therefore, it follows from the definitions that \u03c0+ : U+ \u2192 \u03c0+ (U+ ) is an\nisomorphism of topological groups.\nWe now prove (ii). Let (\u03bbn ) be a Cauchy sequence of elements of \u039b. Let n0 \u2265 0 be such that\nf+ (\u03bbn0 , \u03bbn ) \u2264 1 for all n > n0 . It follows that \u03c0+ (\u03bb\u22121\nn0 \u03bbn ) lies in the stabilizer of c+ in Aut(B+ ),\nwhich is compact. This implies that \u03c0+ (\u03bbn ) is a converging sequence in Aut(B+ ). Hence \u03c0+ has\neff\na unique continuous extension \u03c0 + : \u039b+ \u2192 \u039b+ and it remains to prove that \u03c0 + is surjective. By\nthe preliminary remark above, it follows that \u03c0 + : U + \u2192 \u03c0+ (U+ ) is an isomorphism of topological\ngroups. The surjectivity of \u03c0 + follows easily since U + is an open neighborhood of the identity.\nn\nFinally, since U + contains a basis {K \u01eb } of open neighborhoods of the identity, it follows that \u03c0 +\nmaps an open subset to an open subset.\n(iv). The inclusion T.U + < Stab\u039b+ (c+ ) is clear. Let g \u2208 Stab\u039b+ (c+ ) and let (\u03bbn ) be a sequence\nin \u039b such that lim \u03bbn = g. Up to passing to a subsequence, we may \u2013 and shall \u2013 assume that\nn\u2192+\u221e\n\n\u03bbn \u2208 Stab\u039b (c+ ) for all n. We know by [R\u00e9m02b, \u00a7 3.5.4] that Stab\u039b (c+ ) \u2243 T \u22c9 U+ . Hence each \u03bbn\nhas a unique writing \u03bbn = tn un with tn \u2208 T and un \u2208 U+ . Again, up to extracting a subsequence,\nwe have f+ (\u03bb1 , \u03bbn ) < 1 for all n. In view of the semidirect decomposition Stab\u039b (c+ ) \u2243 T \u22c9 U+ , this\nimplies that tn = t1 for all n. In particular, the sequence (un ) of elements of U+ converges to t\u22121\n1 g.\nThis shows that g \u2208 T.U + as desired. For every nontrivial element t \u2208 T , we have f+ (1, t) = 2\nbecause T \u2229 U+ = {1}. On the other hand, for all u \u2208 U + , we have f+ (1, u) \u2264 1. Therefore, we\nhave T \u2229 U + = {1}.\n(iii). The fact that Z\u039b (\u039b\u2020 ) is discrete follows from Z\u039b (\u039b\u2020 ) \u2229 U+ = {1}. Clearly we have Z\u039b (\u039b\u2020 ) <\nKer(\u03c0 + ). We must prove the reverse inclusion. Let k \u2208 Ker(\u03c0 + ). By (iv), we have k = tu for\neff\nunique elements t \u2208 T and u \u2208 U + . Applying (iv) to the effective group \u039b+ , we obtain \u03c0+ (t) = 1\nand \u03c0 + (u) = 1. Since the restriction of \u03c0 + to U + is injective by the proof of (ii), we deduce u = 1\nand hence k \u2208 T < \u039b. Therefore k \u2208 Z\u039b (\u039b\u2020 ) as desired.\n(i). The building topology comes from a metric, so the Hausdorff group \u039b injects densely in its\ncompletion \u039b+ [Bou71, II.3.7 Corollaire] and the latter group is second countable whenever \u039b is\ncountable. It is locally compact because U + is a compact open subgroup by the proof of (ii).\neff\nFurthermore, \u03c0 + annihilates the connected component of \u039b+ because \u039b+ is totally disconnected.\nOn the other hand, the kernel of \u03c0 + is discrete by (iii). Hence \u039b+ itself is totally disconnected.\n(v). The group U\u2212 acts on B+ with the apartment A+ as a fundamental domain. The group N\nstabilizes A+ and acts transitively on its chambers. In view of (iv), it follows that \u039b+ = U + .N.U\u2212 .\nOn the other hand, it follows easily from the definition of f\u01eb that\nU \u01eb = {g \u2208 \u039b\u01eb | f\u01eb (1, g) \u2264 1}.\nTherefore, the uniqueness assertion follows immediately from [R\u00e9m02b, \u00a71.5.4] and the fact that\n\u039b \u2229 U + = U+ .\n(vi). The main axiom of a refined Tits system is the property of assertion (v), which has just\nbeen proven. For the other axioms to be checked, the arguments are the same as [RR06, Proof of\nTheorem 1.C.(i)].\n\u0003\n9\n\n\f1.3. Twin building lattices. Let qmin = min{|U\u03b1 | : \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a0}, where \u03a0 \u2282 \u03a6 is the set of simple\nroots. The following is an adaptation of the main result of [R\u00e9m99]:\nProposition 2. The image of the diagonal injection\n\u039b \u2192 \u039b+ \u00d7 \u039b\u2212 : \u03bb 7\u2192 (\u03bb, \u03bb)\nis a discrete subgroup of \u039b+ \u00d7 \u039b\u2212 . It is an irreducible lattice if and only if W (1/qmin ) < +\u221e and\nZ\u039b (\u039b\u2020 ) is finite.\nProof. Let \u2206(\u039b) = {(\u03bb, \u03bb) | \u03bb \u2208 \u039b} < \u039b+ \u00d7 \u039b\u2212 . The subgroup U + \u00d7 U \u2212 < \u039b+ \u00d7 \u039b\u2212 is an open\nneighborhood of the identity. We have \u2206(\u039b) \u2229 (U + \u00d7 U \u2212 ) = \u2206(U+ \u2229 U\u2212 ). By [R\u00e9m02b, \u00a73.5.4],\nU+ \u2229 U\u2212 = {1}. Thus \u2206(\u039b) is discrete. The second assertion follows from the proofs of [R\u00e9m05,\nProposition 5 and Corollary 6], which apply here without any modification: the only requirement\nis that (\u039b+ , N, U + , U\u2212 , T, S) and (\u039b\u2212 , N, U \u2212 , U+ , T, S) be refined Tits systems. This follows from\n\u0003\nProposition 1(vi).\nNote that the group Z\u039b (\u039b\u2020 ) may be arbitrarily large, since one may replace \u039b by the direct product\nof \u039b with an arbitrary group; the root groups of \u039b also provide a twin root datum for this direct\nproduct. However it is always possible to make the group Z\u039b (\u039b\u2020 ) finite by taking appropriate\nquotients; note that if \u039b = \u039b\u2020 , then Z\u039b (\u039b\u2020 ) = Z(\u039b) is abelian. Finally, since Z\u039b (\u039b\u2020 ) < T , it\nfollows that Z\u039b (\u039b\u2020 ) is always finite when \u039b is a split or almost split Kac-Moody group.\nDefinition. If the twin root datum (\u039b, {U\u03b1 }\u03b1\u2208\u03a6 ) is such that W (1/qmin ) < +\u221e and Z\u039b (\u039b\u2020 ) is\nfinite, then \u039b is called a twin building lattice.\n1.4. Structure of U + . The first assertion of the following proposition was proved in [RR06, Theorem 1.C(ii)].\nProposition 3. We have the following:\n(i) Assume that each root group U\u03b1 is a finite p-group. Then U + is pro-p.\n(ii) Assume that each root group U\u03b1 is solvable. Then U + is pro-solvable.\n(iii) Assume that each root group U\u03b1 is nilpotent. Then, for every prenilpotent set of roots\n\u03a8 \u2282 \u03a6, the group U\u03a8 = hU\u03b1 | \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a8i is nilpotent.\nRemark. One might expect that, under the assumption that all root groups are nilpotent, the\ngroup U + is pro-nilpotent. This is however not true in general. Counterexamples are provided by\ntwin root data over ground fields of mixed characteristics, constructed in [RR06]. More precisely,\nconsider a twin root datum (\u039b, {U\u03b1 }\u03b1\u2208\u03a6 ) of rank 2 with infinite Weyl group, such that the rank one\nsubgroups are SL2 (F3 ) and SL2 (F4 ). The associated twin building is a biregular twin tree. Then\nthe U+ -action induced on the ball of combinatorial radius 2 centered at c+ is not nilpotent: indeed,\nthe corresponding finite quotient of U+ contains a subgroup isomorphic to the wreath product\n(Z/2Z \u00d7 Z/2Z) \u2240 Z/3Z, which is not nilpotent.\nProof. For (i), see [RR06, 1.C Lemma 1 p.198]. The arguments given in [loc. cit.] can be immediately adapted to provide a proof of (ii): the essential fact is that an extension of a solvable group\n(resp. p-group) by a solvable group (resp. p-group) is again solvable.\n(iii). A set of roots \u03a8 is called nilpotent if it is prenilpotent and if, moreover, for each pair {\u03b1, \u03b2} \u2282 \u03a8\none has [\u03b1, \u03b2] \u2282 \u03a8. Since every prenilpotent set of roots is contained in a nilpotent set (see [R\u00e9m02b,\n\u00a71.4.1 and \u00a72.2.6]), it suffices to prove the assertion for nilpotent sets. The proof is by induction\non the cardinality of \u03a8, the result being obvious when \u03a8 is a singleton. The elements of \u03a8 can\nbe ordered in a nibbling sequence \u03b11 , \u03b12 , . . . , \u03b1n ; hence the sets \u03a81 = \u03a8\\{\u03b11 } and \u03a8n = \u03a8\\{\u03b1n }\nare nilpotent [loc. cit., \u00a71.4.1]. Furthermore, one has [U\u03b11 , U\u03a81 ] \u2264 U\u03a81 and [U\u03b1n , U\u03a8n ] \u2264 U\u03a8n\nas a consequence of (TRD1). Therefore, the subgroups U\u03a81 and U\u03a8n are normal in U\u03a8 , and are\n10\n\n\fnilpotent by the induction hypothesis. It follows that U\u03a8 is nilpotent [Hal76, Theorem 10.3.2].\nThis part of the proof does not require that the root groups be finite.\n\u0003\n2. Further properties of topological completions\nIn this section, we introduce a property of fixed points of root subgroups of a group \u039b endowed\nwith a twin root datum; this property is called (FPRS). We first provide sufficient conditions which\nensure that this property holds for any split or almost split Kac-Moody group, as well as for all\nexotic twin building lattices mentioned in Sect. 1.1. We then show that (FPRS) implies that the\ntopological completion \u039b+ is topologically simple (modulo the kernel of the action on the building,\nsee Proposition 11). Property (FPRS) will be used again below, as a sufficient condition implying\nthat any nontrivial continuous homomorphism whose domain is \u039b+ is proper (Theorem 27).\nThroughout this section, we let \u039b be a group endowed with a twin root datum {U\u03b1 }\u03b1\u2208\u03a6 of type\n(W, S) and let (B+ , B\u2212 ) be the associated twin buildings.\n2.1. Fixed points of root subgroups. For any subgroup \u0393 \u2264 G, we define r(\u0393) to be the supremum of the set of all non-negative real numbers r such that \u0393 fixes pointwise the (combinatorial)\nclosed ball B(c+ , r) of (combinatorial) radius r centered at c+ . In the present subsection, we\nconsider the following condition:\n(FPRS): Given any sequence of roots (\u03b1n )n\u22650 of \u03a6(A ) such that lim d(c+ , \u03b1n ) = +\u221e, we\nn\u2192+\u221e\n\nhave:\n\nlim r(U\u2212\u03b1n ) = +\u221e.\n\nn\u2192+\u221e\n\nRemark. This property can be seen as a non-quantitative generalization of [BT72, 7.4.33].\nIn other words, this means that if the sequence of roots (\u03b1n )n\u22650 is such that lim d(c+ , \u03b1n ) = +\u221e,\nn\u2192+\u221e\n\nthen the sequence of root subgroups (U\u2212\u03b1n )n\u22650 tends to the identity in the building topology. The\npurpose of this subsection is to establish sufficient conditions on the twin root datum (\u039b, (U\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208\u03a6 )\nwhich ensure that property (FPRS) holds. To this end, we will need the following conditions:\n(PP): For any prenilpotent pair of roots {\u03b1, \u03b2} such that hr\u03b1 , r\u03b2 i is infinite, either [U\u03b1 , U\u03b2 ] =\n{1} or there exists a root \u03c6 such that r\u03c6 (\u03b1) = \u2212\u03b2, [U\u03b1 , U\u03b2 ] \u2264 U\u03c6 and [U\u03b1 , U\u03c6 ] = {1} =\n[U\u03b2 , U\u03c6 ].\n(2-sph): The Coxeter system (W, S) is 2-spherical and G possesses no critical rank 2 subgroup.\nThis means that any pair of elements of S generates a finite group and moreover that for\nany pair {\u03b1, \u03b2} \u2282 \u03a0, the group X\u03b1,\u03b2 generated by the four root groups U\u00b1\u03b1 , U\u00b1\u03b2 , divided\nby its center, is not isomorphic to any of the groups B2 (2), G2 (2), G2 (3) or 2 F4 (2).\nThe main result of this section is the following:\nProposition 4. Assume that the twin root datum (\u039b, (U\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208\u03a6 ) satisfies (PP) or (2-sph) or that \u039b\nis a split or almost split Kac-Moody group. Then the property (FPRS) holds.\nRemark. The exotic examples of twin root data mentioned in Sect. 1.1 (I) and (II) satisfy condition\n(PP). In fact, they satisfy even the stronger condition that all commutation relations are trivial: for\nany prenilpotent pair of distinct roots {\u03b1, \u03b2}, one has [U\u03b1 , U\u03b2 ] = {1}. Moreover, the examples of\ntype (III) satisfy (2-sph). However, it was communicated to us by B. M\u00fchlherr that there exists an\nexample of a group endowed with a twin root datum, which does not satisfy condition (FPRS). In\nthis example, whose construction is nontrivial, the Weyl group is the free Coxeter group of rank 3\n(i.e. a free product of 3 copies of the group of order 2) and the ground field is F2 .\nThe proof of Proposition 4 splits into a sequence of lemmas which we prove separately.\n11\n\n\fLemma 5. Assume that (PP) holds. For each integer n \u2265 0, each root \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a6(A ) and each chamber\nn+1\nc \u2208 A+ , if d(c, \u03b1) \u2265 4 3 \u22121 , then U\u2212\u03b1 fixes B(c, n) pointwise. In particular (FPRS) holds.\nProof. We work by induction on n. If d(c, \u03b1) \u2265 1, then c 6\u2208 \u03b1 whence c \u2208 \u2212\u03b1. In particular c is\nfixed by U\u2212\u03b1 . Thus the desired property holds for n = 0.\nn+1\n\nAssume now that n > 0 and let \u03b1 be a root such that d(c, \u03b1) \u2265 4 3 \u22121 . By induction, the group\nU\u2212\u03b1 fixes the ball B(c, n \u2212 1) pointwise. Furthermore, if c\u2032 is a chamber contained in A+ and\nadjacent to c+ , then d(c\u2032 , \u03b1) \u2265 d(c, \u03b1) \u2212 1; therefore, the induction hypothesis also implies that U\u2212\u03b1\nfixes the ball B(c\u2032 , n \u2212 1) pointwise.\nLet now x be a chamber at distance n from c. Let c0 = c, c1 , . . . , cn = x be a minimal gallery\njoining c to x. We must prove that U\u2212\u03b1 fixes x. If c1 is contained in A+ then we are done by the\nabove. Thus we may assume that c1 is not in A+ . Let c\u2032 be the unique chamber of A+ such that\nc, c1 and c\u2032 share a panel. Let \u03b2 \u2208 \u03a6(A ) be one of the two roots such that the wall \u2202\u03b2 separates\nc from c\u2032 . Up to replacing \u03b2 by its opposite if necessary, we may \u2013 and shall \u2013 assume by [Tit90,\nProposition 9] that the pair {\u2212\u03b1, \u03b2} is prenilpotent. Let u \u2208 U\u03b2 be the (unique) element such that\nu(c1 ) belongs to A+ ; thus we have u(c1 ) = c or c\u2032 . Since u(c1 ), u(c2 ), . . . , u(cn ) is a minimal gallery,\nit follows that u(x) is contained in B(c, n \u2212 1) \u222a B(c\u2032 , n \u2212 1).\nThere are three cases.\nSuppose first that [U\u2212\u03b1 , U\u03b2 ] = {1}. For any g \u2208 U\u2212\u03b1 , we have g = u\u22121 gu whence g(x) =\nu\u22121 gu(x) = x because g \u2208 U\u2212\u03b1 fixes B(c, n \u2212 1) \u222a B(c\u2032 , n \u2212 1) pointwise.\nSuppose now that [U\u2212\u03b1 , U\u03b2 ] 6= {1} and that hr\u03b1 , r\u03b2 i is infinite. By property (PP) there exists a root\n\u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6(A ) such that [U\u2212\u03b1 , U\u03b2 ] \u2264 U\u03c6 and r\u03c6 (\u03b1) = \u03b2. Let y0 = c, y1 , . . . , yk be a gallery of minimal\npossible length joining c to a chamber of \u2212\u03c6. Thus we have yk \u2208 \u2212\u03c6, yk\u22121 \u2208 \u03c6 and k = d(c, \u2212\u03c6).\nSince r\u03c6 (\u03b2) = \u03b1 and since either c or c\u2032 belongs to \u03b2, it follows from considering the gallery\nc = y0 , . . . , yk\u22121 , yk = r\u03c6 (yk\u22121 ), r\u03c6 (yk\u22122 ), . . . , r\u03c6 (c), r\u03c6 (c\u2032 )\nn+1\n\nn\n\nof length 2k, that d(c, \u03b1) \u2264 2k, whence d(c, \u2212\u03c6) \u2265 12 d(c, \u03b1) \u2265 4 6 \u22121 > 4 3\u22121 . A similar argument\nn+1\nn\nshows that d(c\u2032 , \u2212\u03c6) \u2265 21 d(c\u2032 , \u03b1) \u2265 4 6 \u22124 > 4 3\u22121 . Therefore, the induction hypothesis shows that\nU\u03c6 fixes B(c, n\u22121)\u222aB(c\u2032 , n\u22121) pointwise. Now, for any g \u2208 U\u2212\u03b1 , we have g(x) = [g, u\u22121 ]u\u22121 gu(x) =\n[g, u\u22121 ](x) because g \u2208 U\u2212\u03b1 fixes B(c, n \u2212 1) \u222a B(c\u2032 , n \u2212 1) pointwise. By (PP), the commutator\n[g, u\u22121 ] commutes with u and, hence, we have [g, u\u22121 ](x) = u\u22121 [g, u\u22121 ]u(x) = x because [g, u\u22121 ] \u2208\nU\u03c6 fixes B(c, n \u2212 1) \u222a B(c\u2032 , n \u2212 1) pointwise.\nSuppose finally that [U\u2212\u03b1 , U\u03b2 ] 6= {1} and that hr\u03b1 , r\u03b2 i is finite. This implies that the pairs {\u2212\u03b1, \u03b2}\nand {\u2212\u03b1, \u2212\u03b2} are both prenilpotent. Therefore, up to replacing \u03b2 by its opposite if necessary, we\nmay \u2013 and shall \u2013 assume that c 6\u2208 \u03b2, whence u(c1 ) = c. Note that hr\u03b1 , r\u03b2 i is contained in a rank 2\nparabolic subgroup P of W . Since any such subgroup is the Weyl group of a Levi factor of rank 2 of\n\u039b, which is itself endowed with a twin root datum of rank 2, it follows from [TW02, Theorem 17.1]\nthat P is of order at most 16. Let [\u2212\u03b1, \u03b2] = {\u03b3 \u2208 \u03a6(A ) | (\u2212\u03b1) \u2229 \u03b2 \u2286 \u03b3, \u03b1 \u2229 (\u2212\u03b2) \u2286 \u2212\u03b3};\nthus [\u2212\u03b1, \u03b2] has at most 8 elements because for every \u03b3 \u2208 [\u2212\u03b1, \u03b2], the reflection r\u03b3 belongs to P .\nOrder the elements of [\u03b2, \u2212\u03b1] in a natural cyclic order: [\u03b2, \u2212\u03b1] = {\u03b2 = \u03b20 , \u03b21 , . . . , \u03b2m = \u2212\u03b1}; this\nmeans that r\u03b2i (\u03b2i\u22121 ) = \u03b2i+1 for i = 1, . . . , k \u2212 1. Such an ordering does exist because the group\nhr\u03b3 | \u03b3 \u2208 [\u03b2, \u2212\u03b1]i is (finite) dihedral. Let c = y0 , y1 , . . . , yk be a gallery of minimal possible length\njoining c to a chamber of \u2212\u03b21 . Thus we have yk \u2208 \u2212\u03b21 , yk\u22121 \u2208 \u03b21 and k = d(c, \u2212\u03b21 ). Since\nr\u03b21 (\u03b2) = \u2212\u03b22 and since c\u2032 belongs to \u03b2, it follows from considering the gallery\nc = y0 , . . . , yk\u22121 , yk = r\u03b21 (yk\u22121 ), r\u03b21 (yk\u22122 ), . . . , r\u03b21 (c), r\u03b21 (c\u2032 )\n12\n\n\fof length 2k, that d(c, \u2212\u03b22 ) \u2264 2k. A straightforward induction yields d(c, \u2212\u03b2i ) \u2264 ik for i = 1, . . . , m.\nIn particular, we have d(c, \u03b1) \u2264 mk = m.d(c, \u2212\u03b21 ). Recall that m + 1 is the cardinality of [\u2212\u03b1, \u03b2].\n\u2032\nWe may now choose a natural cyclic order [\u2212\u03b2, \u2212\u03b1] = {\u2212\u03b2 = \u03b20\u2032 , \u03b21\u2032 , . . . , \u03b2m\n\u2032 = \u2212\u03b1} and repeat\n\u2032\nthe same arguments with c replaced by c , \u03b2 replaced by \u2212\u03b2 and each \u03b2i replaced by r\u03b2 (\u03b2i ). This\nyields d(c\u2032 , \u2212\u03b2i\u2032 ) \u2264 id(c\u2032 , \u2212\u03b21\u2032 ) for each i. Note that d(c, \u2212\u03b21 ) = d(r\u03b2 (c), \u2212r\u03b2 (\u03b21 )) = d(c\u2032 , \u2212\u03b21\u2032 ).\nWe obtain that d(c, \u03b1) \u2212 1 \u2264 d(c\u2032 , \u03b1) \u2264 m\u2032 .d(c, \u2212\u03b21 ), where m\u2032 + 1 is the cardinality of [\u2212\u03b1, \u2212\u03b2].\nObserve now that m + m\u2032 = |P2 | \u2264 8. In particular, we have min{m, m\u2032 } \u2264 4. Therefore, we deduce\nfrom the inequalities above that for each i = 1, . . . , m, we have\n4n \u2212 1\nd(c, \u03b1) \u2212 1\n\u2265\n.\nd(c, \u2212\u03b2i ) \u2265 d(c, \u2212\u03b21 ) \u2265\n4\n3\nBy the induction hypothesis, it follows that for each \u03b3 \u2208]\u2212\u03b1, \u03b2[= [\u2212\u03b1, \u03b2]\\{\u2212\u03b1, \u03b2}, the root subgroup U\u03b3 fixes the ball B(c, n \u2212 1) pointwise.\n\nNow, for any g \u2208 U\u2212\u03b1 , we have g(x) = [g, u\u22121 ]u\u22121 gu(x) = [g, u\u22121 ](x) because g \u2208 U\u2212\u03b1 fixes\nB(c, n \u2212 1) pointwise. Moreover, we have [g, u\u22121 ] \u2208 U]\u2212\u03b1,\u03b2[ = hU\u03b3 | \u03b3 \u2208]\u2212\u03b1, \u03b2[i by (TRD1).\nTherefore, the commutator [g, u\u22121 ] fixes u(x) and we have\n\u0001\ng(x) = [g, u\u22121 ](x) = [[g, u\u22121 ], u\u22121 ] u\u22121 [g, u\u22121 ]u(x) = [[g, u\u22121 ], u\u22121 ](x).\n\nRepeating the argument m times successively, we obtain g(x) = [. . . [[g, u\u22121 ], u\u22121 ], . . . , u\u22121 ](x)\nwhere the commutator is iterated m times. By (TRD1), we have [. . . [[g, u\u22121 ], u\u22121 ], . . . , u\u22121 ] \u2208\nU]\u03b21 ,\u03b2[ , which is trivial since ]\u03b21 , \u03b2[ is empty. Therefore, we deduce finally that g fixes x, as\ndesired.\n\u0003\nLemma 6. Suppose that \u039b is a split Kac-Moody groups and that (U\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208\u03a6 is its natural system of\nroot subgroups. Then the twin root datum (\u039b, (U\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208\u03a6 ) satisfies (PP).\nProof. This follows by combining [Mor87, Theorem 2] with some results from [BP95] (see also\n[Tit87, Sect. 3.2]). In order to be more precise, we freely use the notation and terminology of these\nreferences in the present proof. In particular, we use the 'linear' root system of the Lie algebra\nassociated with the Kac-Moody group \u039b, instead of the 'abstract' root system introduced above\nand which is appropriate to the case of general twin root data. A comprehensive introduction to\nlinear root systems can be found in [MP95, Chapter 5].\n\nCommutation relations in split Kac-Moody groups are described precisely by [Mor87, Theorem 2].\nCombining the latter result together with [BP95, Proposition 1], one sees easily that if {\u03b1, \u03b2} is\na prenilpotent pair such that hr\u03b1 , r\u03b2 i is infinite and [U\u03b1 , U\u03b2 ] 6= {1}, then [U\u03b1 , U\u03b2 ] \u2264 U\u03b1+\u03b2 and\nthe \u03b1-string through \u03b2 is of length \u2265 5 and contains exactly 4 real roots, which are \u03b2 \u2212 h\u03b2, \u03b1\u2228 i\u03b1,\n\u03b2 \u2212 (h\u03b2, \u03b1\u2228 i \u2212 1)\u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b2 + \u03b1. In particular, \u03b2 + 2\u03b1 is not a root, whence {\u2212\u03b1, \u03b1 + \u03b2} is W conjugate to a Morita pair by [BP95, Proposition 3(i)]. In particular, we have h\u2212\u03b1, (\u03b1 + \u03b2)\u2228 i = \u22121\nby [BP95, Proposition 2]. We deduce that r\u03b1+\u03b2 (\u2212\u03b1) = \u2212\u03b1 + h\u2212\u03b1, (\u03b1 + \u03b2)\u2228 i(\u03b1 + \u03b2) = \u03b2. Finally,\nsince 2\u03b1 + \u03b2 is not a root, it follows from [Mor87, Theorem 2] that [U\u03b1 , U\u03b1+\u03b2 ] = {1}. Hence\nproperty (PP) holds, as desired.\n\u0003\nLemma 7. Suppose that \u039b is an almost split Kac-Moody groups and that (U\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208\u03a6 is its natural\nsystem of root subgroups. Then the twin root datum (\u039b, (U\u03b1 )\u03b1\u2208\u03a6 ) satisfies (FPRS).\nProof. Our reference on almost split Kac-Moody groups is [R\u00e9m02b, Chapitres 11\u201313]. Let K be\ne be a split\nthe ground field of \u039b, let Ks be a separable closure of K, let \u0393 = Gal(Ks /K) and let \u039b\ne\nKac-Moody group over Ks , such that \u039b is the fixed point set of a \u0393-action on \u039b. We henceforth\ne We denote by (U\ne\u03b1 ) e the natural system of root subgroups of \u039b\ne and\nview \u039b as a subgroup of \u039b.\n\u03b1\u2208\u03a6\ne+ , B\ne\u2212 ) the twin building associated with the twin root datum (\u039b,\ne (U\ne\u03b1 ) e ). By [R\u00e9m02b,\nby (B\n\u03b1\u2208\u03a6\n13\n\n\fe+ , B\ne\u2212 ), as\nTh\u00e9or\u00e8me 12.4.4], the twin building (B+ , B\u2212 ) is embedded in a \u039b-equivariant way in (B\ne+ , B\ne\u2212 ). This embedding maps chambers of (B+ , B\u2212 ) to Kthe fixed point set of \u0393-action on (B\ne+ , B\ne\u2212 ), which are minimal \u0393-invariant spherical residues. Let r be the rank of such\nchambers of (B\na spherical residue. Two K-chambers are adjacent (as chambers of (B+ , B\u2212 )) if they are contained\nin a common spherical residue of rank r + 1 and either coincide or are opposite in that residue.\ne+ , B\ne\u2212 ) and, moreover, that\nThis shows that bounded subsets of (B+ , B\u2212 ) are also bounded in (B\ne\ne\nevery ball of large radius in (B+ , B\u2212 ) which is centered at a point of a K-chamber contains a ball\nof large radius of (B+ , B\u2212 ).\nLet (\u03b1n )n\u22650 be a sequence of roots of \u03a6 = \u03a6(A ) such that d(c+ , \u03b1n ) tends to infinity with n.\nWe must prove that r(U\u2212\u03b1n ) also tends to infinity with n. We choose the base chamber e\nc+ of\ne\ne\n(B+ , B\u2212 ) such that it is contained in the K-chamber c+ , and denote by re(H) the supremum of the\nradius of a ball centered at e\nc+ which is pointwise fixed by H. In view of the preceding paragraph,\nit suffices to show that re(U\u2212\u03b1n ) tends to infinity with n. To this end, we will use the fact that\ne (U\ne\u03b1 ) e ) satisfies property (FPRS) by Lemmas 5 and 6. Let \u03b2 \u2208 \u03a6 be a K-root and consider\n(\u039b,\n\u03b1\u2208\u03a6\nthe root subgroup U\u03b2 . Let x, y be two adjacent K-chambers such that \u03b2 contains x but not y. Let\ne\n\u03a6(\u03b2)\nbe the set of (Ks -)roots containing x but not y; it is independent of the choice of x and y.\ne\ne\ne\ne and U\u03b2 \u2282 U\nee\nFurthermore \u03a6(\u03b2)\nis a prenilpotent subset of \u03a6\n\u03a6(\u03b2) = hU\u03b3 | \u03b3 \u2208 \u03a6(\u03b2)i by [R\u00e9m02b,\ne n )}\n\u00a712.4.3]. Therefore, in order to finish the proof, it suffices to show that min{d(e\nc+ , \u03b3) | \u03b3 \u2208 \u03a6(\u03b1\ntends to infinity with n.\nAssume for a contradiction that this is not the case. Then there exists a subsequence (\u03b1nj )j\u22650 and\ne n ) such that d(e\nan element \u03b3j \u2208 \u03a6(\u03b1\nc+ , \u03b3j ) is a bounded function of j. Since the apartments are\nj\nlocally finite, it follows that, up to extracting a subsequence, we may \u2013 and shall \u2013 assume that \u03b3j\nis constant. On the other hand, we claim (and prove below) that if \u03b1, \u03b1\u2032 are two distinct K-roots,\ne\ne \u2032 ) are disjoint; this implies that the sequence (\u03b1n )j\u22650 is constant,\nthen the sets \u03a6(\u03b1)\nand \u03a6(\u03b1\nj\ncontradicting the fact that d(c+ , \u03b1nj ) tends to infinity with j. It remains to prove the claim. This\nis most easily done using the notion of (combinatorial) projections in buildings. Let \u03c0 (resp. \u03c0 \u2032 )\nbe a K-panel stabilized by the K-reflection r\u03b1 (resp. r\u03b1\u2032 ). Thus \u03c0 and \u03c0 \u2032 are spherical residues\ne+ of rank r + 1. Note that proj (\u03c0 \u2032 ) (resp. proj \u2032 (\u03c0)) contains a K-chamber. Furthermore,\nof B\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\ne\ne \u2032 ), the (Ks -)reflection r\u03b3 stabilizes both \u03c0 and \u03c0 \u2032 , but it does not stabilize\ngiven any \u03b3 \u2208 \u03a6(\u03b1)\n\u2229 \u03a6(\u03b1\nany K-chamber. Therefore proj\u03c0 (\u03c0 \u2032 ) (resp. proj\u03c0\u2032 (\u03c0)) cannot be reduced to a single K-chamber;\nsince proj\u03c0 (\u03c0 \u2032 ) (resp. proj\u03c0\u2032 (\u03c0)) is a sub-residue of \u03c0 (resp. \u03c0 \u2032 ), it must be of rank r + 1, which\nyields proj\u03c0 (\u03c0 \u2032 ) = \u03c0 (resp. proj\u03c0\u2032 (\u03c0) = \u03c0 \u2032 ). In other words the K-panels \u03c0 and \u03c0 \u2032 are parallel.\nSince r\u03b1 stabilizes any K-panel which is parallel to \u03c0 by [CM05, Proposition 2.7], this implies that\nthe K-reflections r\u03b1 and r\u03b1\u2032 stabilize a common K-panel. Since \u03b1 6= \u03b1\u2032 , we deduce that \u03b1 = \u2212\u03b1\u2032 ,\ne\ne \u2032 ) = {\u2212\u03b3 | \u03b3 \u2208 \u03a6(\u03b1\ne \u2032 )}. In particular, the sets \u03a6(\u03b1)\ne\ne \u2032 ) are\nwhich implies that \u03a6(\u03b1)\n= \u2212\u03a6(\u03b1\nand \u03a6(\u03b1\ndisjoint, a contradiction.\n\u0003\nLemma 8. Suppose that \u039b satisfies condition (2-sph) and that each root group is finite. Then\nproperty (FPRS) holds.\nProof. As before, we denote by (W, S) be the Coxeter system consisting of the Weyl group W\ntogether with its canonical generating set S. If (W, S) is not of irreducible type, then the buildings\nB+ and B\u2212 split into direct products of irreducible components, and it is easy to see that checking\n(FPRS) for the \u039b-action on B+ is equivalent to checking (FPRS) for the induced action on each\nirreducible component. We henceforth assume that (W, S) is of irreducible type. If W is finite,\nthen there is no sequence of roots (\u03b1n )n\u22650 such that d(c+ , \u03b1n ) tends to infinity with n. Assume\n14\n\n\fnow that W is infinite; in particular (W, S) is of rank \u2265 3. Consider a sequence of roots (\u03b1n )n\u22650\nsuch that d(c+ , \u03b1n ) tends to infinity with n. We must prove that r(U\u2212\u03b1n ) tends to infinity with n.\nGiven any two basis roots \u03b1, \u03b1\u2032 , there exists a sequence of basis roots \u03b1 = \u03b10 , \u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1k = \u03b1\u2032\nsuch that r\u03b1i\u22121 does not commute with r\u03b1i for i = 1, . . . , k because (W, S) is irreducible. This\nimplies that each rank two subgroup X\u03b1i\u22121 ,\u03b1i = hU\u00b1\u03b1i\u22121 , U\u00b1\u03b1i i is endowed with a twin root datum\nof irreducible spherical type and rank 2, since (W, S) is 2-spherical. By the classification of such\ngroups [TW02], it follows that U\u03b1i\u22121 and U\u03b1i are finite pi -groups for some prime pi . Since this is\ntrue for each i, we have pi = pi\u22121 , whence the sequence (pi ) is constant. This shows that there\nexists a prime p such that each root group is a finite p-group. By Proposition 3(i), it follows that\n(n)\nU + is pro-p, whence pro-nilpotent. In particular, the descending central series (U+ )n\u22650 tends to\nthe identity in the building topology when n \u2192 +\u221e. Therefore, in order to finish the proof, it\n(n)\nsuffices to show that lim q(\u2212\u03b1n ) = +\u221e, where q(\u03b1) = max{n \u2265 0 : U\u03b1 \u2264 U+ } for each positive\nn\u2192+\u221e\n\nroot \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a6+ .\nFor each integer n \u2265 0, we set \u03a6n+ = {\u03b1 \u2208 \u03a6+ : q(\u03b1) = n}. We claim that each \u03a6n+ is finite. By\nassumption, for every n there exists n\u2032 such that the set {\u03b1j : j \u2265 n\u2032 } does not contain any element\nof \u03a6n+ , the desired assertion follows from the claim. In order to prove the claim, we proceed by\ninduction on n. We first need to recall a consequence of condition (2-sph).\nA pair {\u03b1, \u03b2} \u2282 \u03a6+ is called fundamental if the following conditions hold:\n(FP1): The group hr\u03b1 , r\u03b2 i is finite.\n(FP2): For each \u03b3 \u2208 \u03a6+ such that the group hr\u03b1 , r\u03b2 , r\u03b3 i is dihedral, we have \u03b3 \u2208 [\u03b1, \u03b2]. In\nother words, this means that the pair {\u03b1, \u03b2} is a basis of the root subsystem it generates.\nWe have the following:\n(a) Let {\u03b1, \u03b2} \u2282 \u03a6+ be a fundamental pair. Then, for all \u03b3 \u2208]\u03b1, \u03b2[, we have U\u03b3 \u2264 [U\u03b1 , U\u03b2 ] by\n[Abr96, Proposition 7].\n(b) Let \u03b3 \u2208 \u03a6+ be a root such that d(c+ , \u2212\u03b3) > 1. Then there exists a fundamental pair\n{\u03b1, \u03b2} \u2282 \u03a6+ such that \u03b3 \u2208]\u03b1, \u03b2[. This follows from [BH93, Lemma 1.7] together with the\nfact that (W, S) is 2-spherical.\nWe now prove by induction on n that \u03a6n+ is finite. The set \u03a60+ coincides with \u03a0. Indeed, for each\nsimple root \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a0, the group U\u03b1 fixes c+ but acts non-trivially on the chambers adjacent to c+ .\n(1)\nSince on the other hand, the derived group U+ fixes the ball B(c+ , 1) pointwise, we deduce that\n(1)\nU\u03b1 is not contained in U+ , whence q(\u03b1) = 0. Thus \u03a0 \u2282 \u03a60+ . Conversely, if \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a6+ does not\n(1)\nbelong to \u03a0, then d(c+ , \u2212\u03b1) > 1 and property (a) implies that U\u03b1 \u2264 U+ . Thus q(\u03b1) \u2265 1 and\n\u03b1 6\u2208 \u03a60+ . This shows that \u03a60+ = \u03a0. In particular \u03a60+ is finite.\nLet now n \u2265 1 and assume that \u03a6k+ is finite for all k < n. We must prove that \u03a6n+ is finite.\nLet us enumerate its elements: \u03a6n+ = {\u03b31 , \u03b32 , . . . }. Since n \u2265 1 and since \u03a60+ = \u03a0, we have\nd(c+ , \u2212\u03b3i ) > 1 for all i \u2265 1. Hence, by property (b), for each i there is a fundamental pair\n{\u03b1i , \u03b2i } such that \u03b3i \u2208 ]\u03b1i , \u03b2i [. By property (b), this implies U\u03b3i < [U\u03b1i , U\u03b2i ]. Therefore, we have\nn = q(\u03b3) > max{q(\u03b1i ), q(\u03b2i )}. In particular:\n\nThe set\n\n[\n\n[\n\n{\u03b1i , \u03b2i } \u2282\n\ni>0\n\nn\u22121\n[\n\n\u03a6k+ .\n\nk=0\n\n{\u03b1i , \u03b2i } is thus finite. By the definition of the \u03b3i 's, we have\n\ni>0\n15\n\n\f\u03a6n+ \u2282\n\n[\n\n]\u03b1i , \u03b2i [.\n\ni>0\n\nSince each interval ]\u03b1i , \u03b2i [ is finite [R\u00e9m02b, 2.2.6], this shows that \u03a6n+ is finite.\n\n\u0003\n\n2.2. Density of the commutator subgroup. As before, (\u039b, {U\u03b1 }\u03b1\u2208\u03a6 ) is a twin root datum of\ntype (W, S) and (B+ , B\u2212 ) is the associated twin buildings. We assume moreover, for the rest of\nthis section, that all root groups are finite.\nLemma 9. Assume that property (FPRS) holds, that the Weyl group W is infinite and that the\nassociated Coxeter system (W, S) is irreducible. If \u039b is generated by its root subgroups, then the\ncommutator subgroup [\u039b+ , \u039b+ ] is dense in \u039b+ .\nRemark. If each rank one subgroup X\u03b1 = hU\u03b1 \u222a U\u2212\u03b1 i of \u039b is perfect and if \u039b is generated by\nits root subgroups, then [\u039b+ , \u039b+ ] \u2283 \u039b and, hence, [\u039b+ , \u039b+ ] is dense in \u039b+ . However, there are\nmany examples of groups endowed with a twin root datum satisfying (FPRS) but whose rank one\nsubgroups are not perfect, e.g. Kac-Moody groups over F2 or F3 , or twin building lattices as in\nSect. 1.1(II) where the rank one subgroups may be solvable.\nProof. Let \u03c6 : \u039b+ \u2192 G be a continuous homomorphism to an abelian topological group G. Let \u03a0\nbe the standard root basis of \u03a6, where \u03a6 is the root system of (W, S) indexing the twin root datum\nof \u039b. For each \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a0, let X\u03b1 = hU\u03b1 \u222a U\u2212\u03b1 i. Applying Lemma 10 below to \u03c6|X\u03b1 , it follows that\n\u03c6(U\u03b1 ) = \u03c6(U\u2212\u03b1 ) for all \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a0.\nAssume by contradiction that \u03c6 is nontrivial. Since \u039b = hU\u03b1 | \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a6i = hU\u03b1 | \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a0i, it follows\nthat there is some \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a0 such that \u03c6(U\u03b1 ) is nontrivial. Let u \u2208 U\u03b1 be such that \u03c6(u) 6= 1.\nSince W is infinite and (W, S) is irreducible, there exists \u03b2 \u2208 \u03a6 such that \u03b1 \u2229 \u03b2 = \u2205 [H\u00e9e93,\nProposition 8.1 p.309]. Let t = r\u03b2 r\u03b1 \u2208 W and \u03b1n = tn (\u03b1) for all n \u2265 0. By definition, we have\nlim d(c+ , \u2212\u03b1n ) = +\u221e. Let \u03c4 \u2208 N be such that \u03bd(\u03c4 ) = t \u2208 W , where \u03bd : N \u2192 N/T = W\nn\u2192+\u221e\n\nis the canonical projection. For each n \u2265 0, let un = \u03bd n .u.\u03bd \u2212n . Since G is abelian, we have\n\u03c6(un ) = \u03c6(u) 6= 1 for all n. On the other hand, by definition un \u2208 U\u03b1n and, hence lim un = 1\nn\u2192+\u221e\n\nby (FPRS). This contradicts the continuity of \u03c6.\n\n\u0003\n\nThe following lemma will be used again below, in order to establish restrictions on finite quotients\nof a group endowed with a twin root datum.\nLemma 10. Let (X, {U\u03b1 , U\u2212\u03b1 }) be a twin root datum of rank one. We have the following:\n(i) The group X is not nilpotent.\n(ii) Given a homomorphism \u03c6 : X \u2192 G whose kernel does not centralize X\u03b1 = hU\u03b1 \u222a U\u2212\u03b1 i, we\nhave \u03c6(U\u03b1 ) = \u03c6(U\u2212\u03b1 ).\nProof. (i). The building associated with a twin root datum of rank one is merely an abstract set,\nwhich may be identified with the conjugacy class of U\u03b1 in X. Clearly the kernel of the X-action\nis the centralizer ZX (X\u03b1 ). This implies that the group X\u03b1 is not nilpotent: up to dividing X\u03b1 by\nits center, we obtain a group endowed with a twin root datum of rank one which acts faithfully on\nthe associated building, and is therefore center-free.\n(ii). Since (X, {U\u03b1 , U\u2212\u03b1 }) is a twin root datum of rank one, it follows that X acts 2\u2013transitively,\nhence primitively, on the conjugacy class of U\u03b1 in X. Therefore, the normal subgroup Ker(\u03c6) is\ntransitive on the conjugacy class of U\u03b1 in X\u03b1 because it does not centralize U\u03b1 . In particular, this\nproves that \u03c6(U\u03b1 ) = \u03c6(U\u2212\u03b1 ).\n\u0003\n16\n\n\f2.3. Topological simplicity. The following proposition is an improvement of the topological simplicity theorem of [R\u00e9m04] (see also [CER06, Theorem 3.2]). We also note that, under some\nadditional assumptions, topological completions of Kac-Moody lattices have recently been shown\nto be abstractly simple by L. Carbone, M. Ershov and G. Ritter [CER06].\nProposition 11. Let (W, S) be an irreducible Coxeter system of non-spherical type with associated\nroot system \u03a6. Let (\u039b, {U\u03b1 }\u03b1\u2208\u03a6 ) be a twin root datum of type (W, S) with finite root groups and let\n\u039b+ be its positive topological completion. We assume that the root groups are all solvable and that\n[\u039b+ , \u039b+ ] is dense in \u039b+ . Then:\n(i) Every closed subgroup of \u039b+ normalized by \u039b\u2020 either contains \u039b\u2020 or centralizes \u039b\u2020 . In\n\u2020\nparticular, the group \u039b+ /Z(\u039b\u2020 ) is topologically simple.\n(ii) Let J be an irreducible non-spherical type in S and let GJ be the closure in \u039b+ of the group\ngenerated by the root groups indexed by the simple roots in J and their opposites. Assume\nthat [GJ , GJ ] is dense in GJ . Then any proper closed normal subgroup of GJ is contained\nin the center Z(GJ ).\nRemark. This is the opportunity to correct a mistake in [R\u00e9m04, Proposition 2.B.1 (iv)]. The\nfactor groups there are not topologically simple but simply have property (ii) above: their proper\nclosed normal subgroups fix inessential buildings, but this does not seem to imply easily that the\nwhole ambient building is fixed. This does not affect the rest of the paper. The second author\nthanks M. Ershov for pointing out this mistake to him.\nProof. For both (i) and (ii), the proof is an easy \"topological\" adaptation of the \"abstract\" arguments of [Bou81, IV.2.7]. The essential point is that the group U + , and hence also GJ \u2229 U + , is\n\u0003\npro-solvable by Proposition 3(ii).\n\n3. Non-affine Coxeter groups\nThis section is mainly Coxeter theoretic. We prove that in any non-affine infinite Coxeter complex,\ngiven any root there exist two other roots such that any two roots in the so-obtained triple have\nempty intersection. Such a triple is called a fundamental hyperbolic configuration and used in the\nnext section to prove strong restrictions on finite index normal subgroups for twin root data.\n3.1. Parabolic closure. Let (W, S) be a Coxeter system. Given a subset R of W , we denote by\nPc(R) the parabolic closure of R, namely the intersection of all parabolic subgroups of W containing\nR. This notion is defined in D. Krammer's PhD [Kra94]. It is itself a parabolic subgroup which\ncan be characterized geometrically as follows. Let C be the Coxeter complex associated with\n(W, S). Given R \u2282 W and any simplex \u03c1 of maximal dimension stabilized by hRi, we have:\nPc(R) = StabW (\u03c1).\nBy a Euclidean triangle group, we mean a reflection subgroup of Isom(E2 ) which is the automorphism group of a regular tessellation of the Euclidean plane E2 by triangles. Recall that there are\nthree isomorphism classes of such groups, corresponding respectively to tessellations by triangles\nwith angles ( \u03c03 , \u03c03 , \u03c03 ), ( \u03c02 , \u03c04 , \u03c04 ), ( \u03c02 , \u03c03 , \u03c06 ).\nLemma 12. Let (W, S) be a Coxeter system and let r, s be reflections in W . Assume that the\nproduct \u03c4 = rs is of infinite order. Then the following holds.\n(i) The Coxeter diagram of Pc(\u03c4 ) is irreducible.\n(ii) The reflections r and s belong to Pc(\u03c4 ).\n17\n\n\f(iii) Let t be a reflection which does not centralize \u03c4 and such that hr, s, ti is isomorphic to a\nEuclidean triangle group. Then t belongs to Pc(\u03c4 ).\nProof. We first prove that (ii) implies (i). Let us assume that (ii) holds. By a suitable conjugation\nin W , we may \u2013 and shall \u2013 assume that Pc(\u03c4 ) = WJ for some subset J \u2286 S. Let Jr be the\nconnected component of J such that the irreducible factor WJr contains r. If s did not belong to\nWJr then r and s would generate a subgroup isomorphic to Z/2Z \u00d7 Z/2Z, contradicting that \u03c4 is\nof infinite order. Therefore s \u2208 Jr and by definition of the parabolic closure we have J = Jr .\nSuppose (ii) fails. Without loss of generality, this means that r 6\u2208 Pc(\u03c4 ). Let C be the Coxeter\ncomplex associated with (W, S) and \u03c1 be a simplex of maximal dimension which is stabilized by\nh\u03c4 i. Since r 6\u2208 Pc(\u03c4 ), it follows that \u03c1 is contained in the interior of oneTof the two half-spaces\ndetermined by r. Let \u03b1 be this half-space.\nWe have \u03c1 \u2282 \u03b1, and hence \u03c1 \u2282 n\u2208Z \u03c4 n .\u03b1 because \u03c1 is\nT\n\u03c4 -invariant. This is absurd since n\u2208Z \u03c4 n .\u03b1 is empty.\n\nThe proof of (iii) is similar. Let t be a reflection which does not centralize \u03c4 and such that hr, s, ti\nis isomorphic to a Euclidean triangle group. Let \u03b2 be any of the two half-spaces associated with t.\nUsing the fact\nT that \u03c4 does not centralize t, it is immediate to check in the Euclidean plane that the\nintersection n\u2208Z \u03c4 n .\u03b2 is empty. Hence the same argument as in the proof of (ii) can be applied\nand yields t \u2208 Pc(\u03c4 ).\n\u0003\nWe also need the following result due to D. Krammer. It is a first evidence that non-affine Coxeter\ngroups have some weak hyperbolic properties.\nProposition 13. Let (W, S) be an irreducible, non-affine Coxeter system. Let w \u2208 W be such that\nPc(w) = W . Then the cyclic group generated by w is of finite index in its centralizer.\nReference. This is [Kra94, Corollary 6.3.10].\n\n\u0003\n\nRemark. This result is of course false for affine Coxeter groups of rank \u2265 3, since the centralizer\nof any translation in such a group contains the translation subgroup.\n3.2. Fundamental hyperbolic configuration. The non-linearity proof in [R\u00e9m04, \u00a74] makes\ncrucial use (for a very specific case of Weyl groups) of the fundamental hyperbolic configuration\ndefined in the introduction of this section. We prove here that the Coxeter complex of any infinite\nnon-affine irreducible Coxeter group contains many such configurations. Note that an affine Coxeter complex does not contain any fundamental hyperbolic configuration. We do not assume the\ngenerating set S to be finite.\nTheorem 14. Let (W, S) be an irreducible non-affine Coxeter system and let C be the associated\nCoxeter complex. Let \u03b1, \u03b2 be two disjoint non-opposite root half-spaces of C . Then there exists a\nroot half-space \u03b3 such that \u03b3 \u2229 \u03b1 = \u03b3 \u2229 \u03b2 = \u2205.\nProof. Let us first deal with the case when S is infinite. The pair {r\u03b1 ; r\u03b2 } is contained in a finitely\ngenerated standard parabolic subgroup of W : take explicit (minimal) writings of r\u03b1 and r\u03b2 in the\ngenerating system S; the union of all elements used in these writings defines a finite non-spherical\nsubdiagram. Up to adding a finite number of vertices to this subdiagram, we may assume that\nit is irreducible and non-affine. The corresponding standard parabolic subgroup of W is finitely\ngenerated and contains r\u03b1 and r\u03b2 .\nWe henceforth assume that the generating system S is finite and denote by | S | its cardinality. We\nprove the assertion by induction on | S |. The roots \u03b1 and \u03b2 being non-opposite, the corresponding\nreflections r\u03b1 and r\u03b2 generate an infinite dihedral subgroup in W . This excludes | S | = 1 and\n| S |= 2, except possibly when the two vertices are connected by an edge labelled by \u221e. But since\nthe latter diagram is affine, the induction starts at | S | = 3.\n18\n\n\fAssume first that | S | = 3, i.e. that the Coxeter diagram of (W, S) is a triangle. Denoting by a, b\nand c the labels of its edges, we have a, b, c \u2265 3, and also a1 + 1b + 1c < 1 because (W, S) is non-affine.\nLet H2 denote the hyperbolic plane and let T be a geodesic triangle in H2 of angles \u03c0a , \u03c0b and \u03c0c\n(an angle equal to 0 correspond to a vertex in the boundary of H2 ). It follows from Poincar\u00e9's\npolyhedron theorem that the reflection group generated by T is isomorphic to W and that the\nso-obtained hyperbolic tiling is a geometric realization of the Coxeter complex of (W, S) [Mas88,\nIV.H]. Thanks to this geometric realization, the result is then clear when | S | = 3.\nAssume now that | S | > 3 and that the result is proved for any Coxeter system as in the theorem\nand whose canonical set of generators has less than | S | elements. Denote by \u03c4 the infinite order\nelement r\u03b1 r\u03b2 . Using a suitable conjugation, we may \u2013 and shall \u2013 assume that Pc(\u03c4 ) is standard\nparabolic, i.e. Pc(\u03c4 ) = WJ for some J \u2286 S. According to Lemma 12, the Coxeter system (WJ , J)\nis irreducible by (i) and we have r\u03b1 , r\u03b2 \u2208 WJ by (ii). Then two cases occur.\nThe first case is when (WJ , J) is non-affine. By the induction hypothesis, we only have to deal with\nthe case J = S and WJ = W . If any canonical generator in S centralized \u03c4 , then we would have\nW = ZW (\u03c4 ); but \u03c4 cannot be central in W since \u03c4 = r\u03b1 r\u03b2 does not centralize r\u03b1 and r\u03b2 . Therefore\nthere exists a reflection t \u2208 S such that t does not centralize \u03c4 . Let T be the subgroup generated\nby t, r\u03b1 and r\u03b2 . If T were isomorphic to a Euclidean triangle group, then ZT (\u03c4 ) would contain a\nfree abelian group of rank 2. This is impossible by Proposition 13. Therefore, T is isomorphic to\na hyperbolic triangle group and we can conclude as in the case | S | = 3.\nThe remaining case is when (WJ , J) is affine. Then J is properly contained in S because W is\nnon-affine and there exists an element s \u2208 S \\ J which does not normalize WJ . In particular s\ndoes not centralize \u03c4 because Pc(\u03c4 ) = WJ . Let T \u2032 be the subgroup generated by s, r\u03b1 and r\u03b2 . If\nT \u2032 is isomorphic to a Euclidean triangle group, then Lemma 12 (iii) implies that s \u2208 WJ , which is\nexcluded. Thus T \u2032 is isomorphic to a hyperbolic triangle group and we are again reduced to the\ncase | S | = 3.\n\u0003\n4. Simplicity of twin building lattices\nAs mentioned in the introduction, the proof of the main simplicity theorem applies to the general\nsetting of twin building lattices: the only required assumption is that root groups are nilpotent (see\nTheorem 19). The proof splits into two parts, each of which is presented in a separate subsection\nbelow. These two parts have each their own specific hypotheses and are each of independent\ninterest.\n4.1. Finite quotients of groups with a twin root datum. Here, we prove strong restrictions\non finite index normal subgroups of a group endowed with a twin root datum, under the assumption\nthat root groups are nilpotent. These conditions are fulfilled by Kac-Moody groups over arbitrary\nfields since their Levi factors are abstractly isomorphic to reductive algebraic groups.\nTheorem 15. Let (W, S) be a Coxeter system with associated root system \u03a6 and let \u03a0 be the root\nbasis associated to S. Let G be a group endowed with a twin root datum {U\u03b1 }\u03b1\u2208\u03a6 indexed by \u03a6.\nSuppose that:\n(1) The Coxeter system (W, S) is irreducible, non-spherical and non-affine;\n(2) For any \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a0, the root group U\u03b1 is nilpotent.\nLet H be a normal subgroup of G such that N/T.(N \u2229 H) is finite. Let G\u2020 be the subgroup of G\ngenerated by the root groups, let H \u2020 = H \u2229 G\u2020 , let \u03c0 : G\u2020 \u2192 G\u2020 /H \u2020 be the canonical projection and\nfor each \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a0, denote by f\u03b1 the inclusion U\u03b1 \u2192 G\u2020 . Then the composed map:\nQ\n\u2020 \u2212\u2212\u2212\n\u2192 G\u2020 /H \u2020\nQ\u2212\u2212\u2192 G \u2212\n\u03b1\u2208\u03a0 U\u03b1 \u2212\u2212\n\u03c0\n\nf\u03b1\n\n19\n\n\fis a surjective homomorphism. In particular, the group G\u2020 /H \u2020 is nilpotent.\nRemark. The finiteness of N/T.(N \u2229 H) is automatically satisfied when H has finite index in G.\nProof. We identify the elements of \u03a6 with the half-spaces of the Davis complex A associated with\n(W, S). We set h = [N : T.(N \u2229 H)].\nLet \u03b1 be an arbitrary root. By [H\u00e9e93, Proposition 8.1 p.309] there is a root \u03b7 such that \u03b1 \u2229 \u03b7 = \u2205.\nThe product \u03c4 = r\u03b7 r\u03b1 has infinite order. We set \u03b2 = \u03c4 h .(\u2212\u03b1) \u2208 \u03a6. We have \u03b2 \u2282 \u03b7 and, hence, the\nroots \u03b1 and \u03b2 are disjoint (see Figure on p. 21). By Theorem 14, there exists a root \u03be \u2208 \u03a6 such\nthat \u03b1 \u2229 \u03be = \u03b7 \u2229 \u03be = \u2205. In particular \u03b2 \u2229 \u03be = \u2205. Again the product \u03c4 \u2032 = r\u03be r\u03b2 has infinite order.\nWe set \u03b3 = (\u03c4 \u2032 )h .(\u2212\u03b2).\nBy construction, we have \u03b3 \u2282 \u03be (see Figure 1). Hence the roots \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 are pairwise disjoint.\nTherefore it follows from Assumption (2) and Proposition 3(iii) that the group U \u2032 = hU\u03b1 \u222a U\u2212\u03b3 i is\nnilpotent, and so is its image \u03c0(U \u2032 ). But by (TRD2) we have\nU\u03b2 = \u03c4 h U\u2212\u03b1 \u03c4 \u2212h\n\nand\n\nU\u2212\u03b3 = (\u03c4 \u2032 )h U\u03b2 (\u03c4 \u2032 )\u2212h .\n\nNote that N/T.(N \u2229 H) is the quotient of the Weyl group W = N/T induced by H \u22b3 G. Since h\nis the order of the quotient N/T.(N \u2229 H), applying \u03c0 provides \u03c0(U\u2212\u03b1 ) = \u03c0(U\u03b2 ) = \u03c0(U\u2212\u03b3 ), which\nimplies\n\u03c0(U \u2032 ) = h\u03c0(U\u03b1 ) \u222a \u03c0(U\u2212\u03b1 )i = \u03c0(X\u03b1 ).\nThis shows that \u03c0(X\u03b1 ) is a nilpotent group.\nNote that (X\u03b1 , {U\u03b1 , U\u2212\u03b1 }) is a twin root datum of rank one. By Lemma 10(i), the group X\u03b1 is not\nnilpotent and, hence, X\u03b1 \u2229H = Ker(\u03c0 |X\u03b1 ) is not central in X\u03b1 . Therefore, we have \u03c0(U\u03b1 ) = \u03c0(U\u2212\u03b1 )\nby Lemma 10(ii).\nFinally, for any two distinct roots \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 \u03a0, we have [U\u03b1 , U\u2212\u03b2 ] = 1 by axiom (TRD1). In view\nof the preceding paragraph, this implies that [\u03c0(U\u03b1 ), \u03c0(U\u03b2 )] = 1 for all distinct \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 \u03a0. The\nS\ndesired result follows by noticing that G\u2020 is generated by \u00b1\u03b1\u2208\u03a0 U\u03b1 . This is easily seen using\naxiom (TRD2) of twin root data to produce elements in N and then to conjugate the simple root\ngroups by these elements to produce any desired root group.\n\u0003\nThe following corollary applies to all split and almost split Kac-Moody groups over finite fields.\nCorollary 16. Let G be a group as in Theorem 15, maintain the assumptions (1) and (2) and\nassume moreover that root groups are finite. Here we let H \u2020 denote the intersection of all finite\nindex normal subgroups of G\u2020 . Then\nQ\n[G\u2020 : H \u2020 ] \u2264 \u03b1\u2208\u03a0 |U\u03b1 |.\n\nFurthermore, we have H \u2020 = G\u2020 whenever one of the following holds:\n(3) Each group X\u03b1 , \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a0, is a finite group of Lie type and the minimal order qmin = min{|U\u03b1 | :\n\u03b1 \u2208 \u03a0} > 3;\n(4) The Coxeter system (W, S) is 2-spherical, i.e. every 2\u2013subset of S generates a finite group,\nand qmin > 2;\n(5) The Coxeter system (W, S) is simply laced, i.e. every 2\u2013subset of S generates a group of\norder 4 or 6.\nRemark. The above group H \u2020 is contained in any finite index normal subgroup of G.\n\nProof. Let H be a finite index normal subgroup in G\u2020 . Applying Theorem 15 to G\u2020 we see that\nthe index [G\u2020 : H] is uniformly bounded, so that finite index subgroups of G\u2020 are finite in number.\n20\n\n\f\u03c4 = r\u03b7 \u25e6 r\u03b1\n\u03b2 = (\u03c4 )h .(\u2212\u03b1)\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b7\n\n\u03c4 = r\u03be \u25e6 r\u03b2\n\u03be\n\n\u03b3 = (\u03c4 \u2032 )h .(\u2212\u03b2)\nFigure 1. Proof of Theorem 15\nThis implies that the intersection defining H \u2020 is finite, so that H \u2020 is itself a finite index subgroup.\nIt remains to apply again Theorem 15 to obtain the desired bound on [G\u2020 : H \u2020 ].\nIf condition (3) holds, then each X\u03b1 is perfect (in fact: simple modulo center), so admits no nontrivial nilpotent quotient. Equality H \u2020 = G\u2020 follows from Theorem 15 applied to G\u2020 . Similarly,\nif (4) or (5) holds then for each \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a0 there exists \u03b2 \u2208 \u03a0 \u2212 {\u03b1} such that X\u03b1,\u03b2 = hX\u03b1 , X\u03b2 i is a\nrank 2 finite group of Lie type. All such groups are perfect except B2 (2) and G2 (2) (which contain\nboth a simple subgroup of index 2). Since (4) implies qmin > 2 and (5) implies that X\u03b1,\u03b2 is of type\nA2 , the group X\u03b1,\u03b2 is isomorphic to neither of the latter groups and we have again H \u2020 = G\u2020 . \u0003\nTheorem 15 and its corollary imply that any Kac-Moody group over a finite field of irreducible\nnon-spherical and non-affine type, admits at most a finite number of finite quotients, which are\nnecessarily abelian. Furthermore, if the ground field is of cardinality at least 4 and if the group\nis generated by its root groups, e.g. because it is simply connected, then all finite quotients are\ntrivial.\nWe close this subsection with an example of a Kac-Moody group which admits nontrivial finite\nquotients when the ground field is F2 or F3 . We set I = {1, 2, 3} and consider the generalized\nCartan matrix\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n2 \u22122 \u22122\n2 \u22122 \uf8f8.\nA = (Aij )i,j\u2208I = \uf8ed \u22122\n\u22122 \u22122\n2\nLet GA be the simply connected Tits functor of type A [Tit87, 3.7.c]. We set \u039b = GA (F2 ). For\neach i \u2208 I, we let \u03c6i : SL2 (F2 ) \u2192 \u039b be the standard homomorphism\n\u0012 [Tit87,\n\u0012 3.9] and\n\u0013 \u00a72 and\n\u0013 let\n1 1\n1 0\nfi : SL2 (F2 ) \u2192 F2 be the surjective homomorphism defined by fi\n= fi\n= 1.\n0 1\n1 1\nUsing the defining relations of \u039b [R\u00e9m02b, \u00a78.3], we see that there is a unique homomorphism\n21\n\n\fQ\nQ\nQ\nf : \u039b \u2192 i\u2208I F2 such that f \u25e6 ( i\u2208I \u03c6i ) = i\u2208I fi . By the definition of fi , the homomorphism f\nis surjective.\n4.2. Non-arithmeticity. For the next statement we recall that for a group inclusion A < B, the\ncommensurator of A in B, denoted CommB (A), consists of the elements b \u2208 B such that A and\nbAb\u22121 share a finite index subgroup. According to a well-known theorem of G. Margulis, a lattice\nin a semisimple Lie group is arithmetic if and only if its commensurator is dense in the ambient\nLie group [Zim84, 6.2.5].\nCorollary 17. Let \u039b be a group as in Theorem 15. Suppose moreover that assumption (3) of\nCorollary 16 holds and let \u039b+ (resp. \u039b\u2212 ) be the\n\u0001 positive (resp. negative) topological completion of\n\u2020\n\u039b. Then the commensurator Comm\u039b+ \u00d7\u039b\u2212 \u039b is a discrete subgroup of \u039b+ \u00d7 \u039b\u2212 .\n\nProof. Recall that \u039b\u2020 is viewed \u0001here as a diagonal subgroup of \u039b+ \u00d7 \u039b\u0001\u2212 . By Corollary 16, the\ncommensurator Comm\u039b+ \u00d7\u039b\u2212 \u039b\u2020 is equal to the normalizer N\u039b+ \u00d7\u039b\u2212 \u039b\u2020 because any finite index\nsubgroup of a given group contains a finite index normal subgroup. Furthermore, the centralizer\nZ\u039b+ (\u039b\u2020 ) (resp. Z\u039b\u2212 (\u039b\u2020 )) is nothing but the kernel of the \u039b+ -action (resp. \u039b\u2212 -action) on the\npositive (resp. negative) building associated with \u039b. By Proposition 1(iii), we have Z\u039b+ (\u039b\u2020 ) =\nZ\u039b (\u039b\u2020 ) (resp. Z\u039b\u2212 (\u039b\u2020 ) = Z\u039b (\u039b\u2020 )). Therefore, we have an exact sequence:\n\u0001\n1 \u2212\u2192 Z\u039b (\u039b\u2020 ) \u00d7 Z\u039b (\u039b\u2020 ) \u2212\u2192 N\u039b+ \u00d7\u039b\u2212 \u039b\u2020 \u2212\u2192 Aut(\u039b\u2020 ).\nThis yields an exact sequence\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\n1 \u2212\u2192 Z\u039b (\u039b\u2020 ) \u00d7 Z\u039b (\u039b\u2020 ) .\u039b\u2020 \u2212\u2192 N\u039b+ \u00d7\u039b\u2212 \u039b\u2020 \u2212\u2192 Out(\u039b\u2020 ),\n\nwhere Out(\u039b\u2020 ) = Aut(\u039b\u2020 )/ Inn(\u039b\u2020 ) is the outer automorphism group. By [CM05, Corollary B],\nthe group Out(\u039b\u2020 ) is finite. Since (Z\u039b (\u039b\u2020 ) \u00d7 Z\u039b (\u039b\u2020 )).\u039b\u2020 is a discrete\nsubgroup \u0001of \u039b+ \u00d7 \u039b\u2212 by\n\u0001\nPropositions 1(iii) and 2, it finally follows that Comm\u039b+ \u00d7\u039b\u2212 \u039b\u2020 = N\u039b+ \u00d7\u039b\u2212 \u039b\u2020 is discrete as\nwell.\n\u0003\n4.3. Normal subgroup property. In view of Corollary 16, the complementary property necessary in order to obtain simplicity of the group H \u2020 (modulo center) is that any non-central normal\nsubgroup has finite index. This is called the normal subgroup property and is well-known for\nirreducible higher rank lattices in Lie groups [Mar91, IV.4.9]. The generalization to irreducible cocompact lattices in products of topological groups follows from work by U. Bader and Y. Shalom,\nfollowing Margulis' general strategy (see [Sha00] and mostly [BS06, Introduction] for an explanation of the substantial differences with the classical case). In the attempt of adapting these results\nto Kac-Moody groups over finite fields, one has to overcome the fact that Kac-Moody lattices are\nnever cocompact. This was done in [R\u00e9m05] by proving that one can find a fundamental domain\nD for \u039b in \u039b+ \u00d7 \u039b\u2212 with respect to which the associated cocycle is square integrable.\nThe following result is a restatement of the normal subgroup theorem proved in [BS06] and [R\u00e9m05],\nin the general framework of twin building lattices.\nTheorem 18. Let (\u039b, {U\u03b1 }\u03b1\u2208\u03a6 ) be a twin root datum of type (W, S). We assume that:\n(NSP1): Each root group U\u03b1 is finite and solvable.\n(NSP2): The group \u039b is a twin building lattice in the sense of 1.3.\n(NSP3): The derived group [\u039b+ , \u039b+ ] is dense in \u039b+ .\nThen any subgroup of \u039b which is normalized by \u039b\u2020 , either centralizes \u039b\u2020 or contains a finite index\nsubgroup of \u039b\u2020 .\n22\n\n\fRemarks. 1. There is no condition excluding affine diagrams. Indeed, Kac-Moody groups of\naffine type are {0, \u221e}-arithmetic groups and as such are irreducible lattices in higher-rank algebraic\ngroups: this case was already covered by Margulis' theorem.\n2. As pointed out to us by M. Burger, an infinite group with the normal subgroup property cannot\nbe hyperbolic since it is incompatible with SQ-universality, the property that any countable group\nembeds in a suitable quotient of the group under consideration. Any non-elementary hyperbolic\ngroup is SQ-universal [Del96], [Ols95]. The fact that no Kac-Moody group can be hyperbolic can\nalso be derived from the specific property that Kac-Moody groups over finite fields contain infinitely\nmany conjugacy classes of torsion elements.\nProof. Let H be a normal subgroup of \u039b which does not centralize \u039b\u2020 and set H \u2020 = H \u2229 \u039b\u2020 . Note\nthat a subgroup of \u039b (resp. \u039b+ ) centralizes \u039b\u2020 if and only if its acts trivially on the building B+ .\nHence, it suffices to show that the index of H \u2020 in \u039b\u2020 is finite. To this end, we apply the main\nresults of [BS06]. This requires to ensure that two conditions are fulfilled. The first condition is\n\u2020\nthat the closure of H \u2020 in \u039b\u00b1 is cocompact; this is an immediate consequence of Proposition 11(i).\nThe second condition is the existence of a fundamental domain D for \u039b with respect to which the\nassociated cocycle is square integrable; this is provided by the same arguments as in [R\u00e9m05]. We\ndo not go into details here because this question is more carefully examined Subsect. 7.2, where\nwe prove a refinement of the square integrability. We merely remark that the group combinatorics\nneeded to prove the existence of D, namely the structure of refined Tits system defined in [KP85],\nis available for arbitrary twin root data, and not only for those arising from Kac-Moody groups,\n\u0003\nsee Proposition 1(vi).\n4.4. Simplicity of lattices. We can now put together the two ingredients needed to prove the\nsimplicity theorem for twin building lattices.\nTheorem 19. Let (\u039b, {U\u03b1 }\u03b1\u2208\u03a6 ) be a twin root datum of type (W, S). Let \u039b\u2020 be the subgroup\ngenerated by all root groups and assume that:\n(S0):\n(S1):\n(S2):\n(S3):\n\nThe Coxeter system (W, S) is irreducible, non-spherical and non-affine.\nEach root group U\u03b1 is finite and nilpotent.\nThe group \u039b is a twin building lattice in the sense of 1.3.\nThe derived group [\u039b+ , \u039b+ ] is dense in \u039b+ .\n\nThen the quotient \u039b\u2020 /Z(\u039b\u2020 ) is virtually simple.\nAssume instead of (S3) that:\n(S3+): Each rank one group X\u03b1 = hU\u03b1 \u222a U\u2212\u03b1 i is perfect.\nThen any subgroup of \u039b, normalized by \u039b\u2020 , either centralizes \u039b\u2020 or contains \u039b\u2020 .\nRemark. This theorem applies to the groups of mixed characteristics defined in [RR06] provided\nthe minimal size of the finite ground fields is large enough with respect to the growth of the (rightangled) Weyl group. In this case the lattices are by definition generated by their root groups and\ncondition (S3+) is fulfilled. One can push a little further this construction by replacing the rank 1\nLevi factors, isomorphic to some suitable SL2 (q)'s, by affine groups. In this case, the root groups\nare isomorphic to multiplicative groups of finite fields, so the thicknesses are prime powers, and\nrank 1 subgroups are solvable. Condition (S3) is still fulfilled in view of Proposition 4 and Lemma 9.\nProof. Let H \u2020 be the intersection of all finite index normal subgroups of \u039b\u2020 . The center of H \u2020 is a\nnormal subgroup of \u039b\u2020 , which must be central in \u039b\u2020 in view of Theorem 18. In particular Z(H \u2020 ) is\nfinite and, moreover, the canonical projection of H \u2020 in \u039b\u2020 /Z(\u039b\u2020 ) is isomorphic to H \u2020 /Z(H \u2020 ) and\ncoincides with the intersection of all finite index subgroups of \u039b\u2020 /Z(\u039b\u2020 ).\n23\n\n\fBy Corollary 16, the index of H \u2020 in \u039b\u2020 is finite. On the other hand, it follows from Theorem 18 that\n\u039b\u2020 /Z(\u039b\u2020 ) is just infinite (i.e. every nontrivial quotient is finite). Therefore, it follows from [Wil71,\nProposition 1] that H \u2020 /Z(H \u2020 ) is a direct product of finitely many isomorphic simple groups. Write\nH \u2020 /Z(H \u2020 ) = H1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Hk . We must prove that k = 1.\n\u2020\n\n\u2020\n\nNotice that H \u2020 , viewed as a diagonally embedded subgroup, is a lattice in \u039b+ \u00d7 \u039b\u2212 , because it is a\nfinite index subgroup of the lattice \u039b\u2020 . Furthermore, H \u2020 is irreducible. Indeed, since H \u2020 is a finite\n\u2020\n\u2020\nindex normal subgroup of \u039b\u2020 , its closure H in \u039b+ is a non-central closed normal subgroup, which\n\u2020\n\nmust coincide with \u039b+ by Proposition 11(i).\nAssume now that k > 1. It follows that the simple group H1 is a quotient of H \u2020 which is not\nco-central, since we have a composed map\nH \u2020 \u2192 H \u2020 /Z(H \u2020 ) = H1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Hk \u2192 H1 .\n\u2020\n\nThe closure of the projection of the corresponding normal subgroup of H \u2020 in \u039b+ is thus a non\u2020\n\n\u2020\n\ncentral closed normal subgroup of \u039b+ . Hence it coincides with \u039b+ by Proposition 11(i). By [BS06,\nTheorem 1.3], this implies that H1 is amenable. Since the Hi 's are all isomorphic, it follows that\nH \u2020 /Z(H \u2020 ) is amenable, and so is \u039b\u2020 since Z(H \u2020 ) and [\u039b\u2020 : H \u2020 ] are finite. Recall that \u039b\u2020 acts on the\nassociated positive building B+ , which may be viewed as a proper CAT(0)-space. Amenability of\n\u039b\u2020 implies that its action on B+ stabilizes a Euclidean flat or fixes a point in the visual boundary\nat infinity [AB98]. Both eventualities are absurd. This shows that k = 1 as desired.\nAssume now that (S3+) also holds. Note that a subgroup of \u039b (resp. \u039b+ ) centralizes \u039b\u2020 if and\nonly if its acts trivially on the building B+ . Hence, in view of what has already been proven, it\nsuffices to show that H \u2020 = \u039b\u2020 . This follows from Corollary 16.\n\u0003\nHere is now the Kac-Moody specialization of this theorem:\nTheorem 20. Let \u039b be a split or almost split Kac-Moody group over a finite field Fq of order q.\nLet us denote by (W, S) the natural Coxeter system of the Weyl group W and by W (t) the growth\nseries of W with respect to S. Assume that (W, S) is irreducible, neither of spherical nor of affine\ntype and that W ( 1q ) < +\u221e. Then the derived group of \u039b, divided by its center, is simple.\nProof. All root groups of \u039b are nilpotent (of class at most 2). Thus conditions (S0), (S1) and (S2)\nare clearly satisfied. In order to deduce the desired statement from Theorem 19 and its proof, it\nremains to show that the derived group [\u039b, \u039b] coincides with the intersection H \u2020 of all finite index\nsubgroups of \u039b\u2020 .\nEach rank one subgroup X\u03b1 = hU\u03b1 \u222a U\u2212\u03b1 i is isomorphic to the Fq -points of a simple algebraic\ngroup of relative rank one. Therefore, the group X\u03b1 is perfect except if U\u03b1 is of order 2 or 3 in\nwhich case it is abelian. In view of Theorem 15, this implies in particular that the quotient \u039b/H \u2020\nis abelian. Thus [\u039b, \u039b] \u2282 H \u2020 . It follows from the proof of Theorem 19 that the latter inclusion\ncannot be proper, as desired.\n\u0003\nNote that if q > 3 then every rank one subgroup of the Kac-Moody group \u039b is perfect and, hence,\ncondition (S3+) holds. In that case, we have [\u039b, \u039b] = \u039b\u2020 .\nKac-Moody groups are the values over fields of group functors defined by J. Tits thanks to combinatorial data called Kac-Moody root data [Tit87]. The main information in a Kac-Moody root\ndatum is given by a generalized Cartan matrix, say A. Once A is fixed we can still make some\nchoices in order for \u039b to be generated by its root groups. In this case, e.g. when we choose the\nsimply connected Kac-Moody root datum [Tit87, 3.7.c], we have \u039b = \u039b\u2020 = [\u039b, \u039b] (if q > 3) and we\nrecover the situation described in the comment of the Simplicity theorem (Introduction).\n24\n\n\fLet us now state a corollary on property (T). Its proof is an opportunistic use of work by J. Dymara\nand T. Januszkiewicz and by P. Abramenko and B. M\u00fchlherr, but has nice rigidity consequences\n(Theorem 33).\nCorollary 21. Let \u039b be a group endowed with a twin root datum satisfying (S0), (S1), (S2) and\n(S3+) of Theorem 19. We assume furthermore that any two canonical reflections in S generate\na finite subgroup of W . If qmin > 1764|S| , then \u039b has Kazhdan's property (T). In particular there\nexist infinitely many isomorphism classes of finitely presented infinite simple groups with Kazhdan's\nproperty (T).\nProof. This is a straightforward application of [DJ02, Theorem E], which provides the 1-cohomology\nvanishing useful to a well-known criterion for property (T) [dlHV89, Chapitre 4]. Finite presentation\nfollows from [AM97] under the hypothesis that qmin > 2. Finally, it follows from [CM05] that KacMoody groups over non isomorphic finite fields (or of different types) are not isomorphic.\n\u0003\nConcretely, in order to produce infinite simple Kazhdan groups, it is enough to pick a generalized\nCartan matrix A = [As,t ]s,t\u2208S such that As,t At,s \u2264 3 for each s 6= t and a finite ground field,\nwhose order is at least the size of A. The above simple groups seem to be the first examples of\ninfinite finitely generated simple groups enjoying property (T). The simple lattices in products of\ntrees constructed by M. Burger and Sh. Mozes [BM01b] are finitely presented but they cannot have\nproperty (T) since they act fixed point freely on trees. However these lattices are torsion free, while\na Kac-Moody group over a finite field of characteristic p contains infinite subgroups of exponent p\n[R\u00e9m02a, proof of Theorem 4.6].\n5. Non-linearity of Kac-Moody groups\nA result of Mal'cev's asserts that any finitely generated linear group is residually finite. In particular, the groups covered by Corollary 16 are not linear over any field. Note that with the notation\nand assumptions of this corollary, the group G\u2020 is finitely generated. In this section, we show that\nthe latter corollary actually implies a strong non-linearity statement for Kac-Moody groups over\narbitrary fields of positive characteristic.\n5.1. Normal subgroups (arbitrary ground field). The proof of the non linearity theorem\nbelow (Theorem 24) requires the following statement, which is a complement to Theorem 15. The\nreader familiar with infinite-dimensional Lie algebras will recognize some similarity with [Kac90,\nProposition 1.7].\nProposition 22. Let A be a generalized Cartan matrix which is indecomposable and non-affine,\nlet GA be a Tits functor of type A and let K be an infinite field. We set G = GA (K) and G\u2020 = hU\u03b1 :\n\u03b1 \u2208 \u03a6i, where {U\u03b1 }\u03b1\u2208\u03a6 is the twin root datum given by the root groups. Then given any normal\nsubgroup H of G, either H contains G\u2020 or H \u2229 U\u03a8 = {1} for each nilpotent set of roots \u03a8.\nProof. Let H \u22b3 G be such that H \u2229 U\u03a8 6= {1} for some nilpotent set of roots \u03a8. We must prove\nthat H \u2283 G\u2020 . The set \u03a8 is finite [R\u00e9m02b, 2.2.6]; we assume that it is of minimal cardinality with\nrespect to the property that H \u2229 U\u03a8 6= {1} and we set n = |\u03a8|.\nSuppose that n > 1. The elements of \u03a8 can be ordered in a nibbling sequence \u03b11 , \u03b12 , . . . , \u03b1n [loc.\ncit., 1.4.1]. Now let g \u2208 H \u2229U\u03a8 \u2212{1}. The group U\u03a8 decomposes as a product U\u03a8 = U\u03b11 U\u03b12 . . . U\u03b1n\n[loc. cit., 1.5.2], so we have g = u1 u2 . . . un with ui \u2208 U\u03b1i for each i = 1, ..., n. By the minimality\nassumption on \u03a8, the elements u1 and un must be nontrivial. We set j = min{i > 1 : ui 6= 1}. By\nLemma 23 below, we can pick some h \u2208 ZT (U\u03b11 ) not centralizing U\u03b1j ). By the defining relations\nof GA , we see in a suitable parametrization of U\u03b1j by the additive group (K, +) that the action of\n25\n\n\fh on U\u03b1j by conjugation is merely a multiplication by an element of K\u00d7 . Therefore h centralizes\nno nontrivial element of U\u03b1j and we obtain successively:\ng\u22121 h\u22121 gh =\n=\n=\n=\n\n\u22121 \u22121 h h\nh\nu\u22121\nn . . . uj u1 u1 uj . . . un\n\u22121 \u22121\nh\nh\nu\u22121\nn . . . uj u1 u1 uj . . . un\n\u22121\nh\nh\nu\u22121\nn . . . uj uj . . . un\n\u22121 h \u2032\n\u2032\nuj uj uj+1 . . . un\n\nfor some u\u2032i \u2208 U\u03b1i (i = j + 1, . . . , n) and where the last equality follows from the commutation\nrelations satisfied by the U\u03b1 's in view of (TRD 1). Since T normalizes H, we have g\u22121 h\u22121 gh \u2208 H.\nh\n\u22121 \u22121\nMoreover the definition of j and the choice of h imply that u\u22121\nj uj 6= 1 so in particular g h gh 6= 1.\nThis shows that H \u2229 U\u03a8\u2212{\u03b11 } 6= {1}, which contradicts the minimality of |\u03a8|. Thus n = 1.\nThis shows that H \u2229 U\u03b1 is nontrivial for some \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a6+ . Since the group hU\u03b1 \u222a U\u2212\u03b1 i is quasi-simple\nand since its center intersects U\u03b1 trivially, we deduce that H contains U\u03b1 \u222a U\u2212\u03b1 . Let \u03a0 be a basis\nof \u03a6 containing \u03b1 and let \u03b2 \u2208 \u03a0 \u2212 {\u03b1} be such that the associated reflections r\u03b1 and r\u03b2 do not\ncommute. Since K is infinite, it follows that T \u2229 hU\u03b1 \u222a U\u2212\u03b1 i 6\u2282 ZT (U\u03b2 ). In particular, there exists\nh\u2032 \u2208 T \u2229 H and u \u2208 U\u03b2 such that h\u2032 u(h\u2032 )\u22121 u\u22121 6= 1. Thus H \u2229 U\u03b2 is nontrivial and, as above, this\nimplies that H contains U\u03b2 \u222a U\u2212\u03b2 . Finally, since A is indecomposable we obtain U\u03b3 < H for any\n\u03b3 \u2208 \u03a6, that is to say H \u2283 G\u2020 .\n\u0003\nLet us now immediately prove the lemma we used in the previous proof.\nT\nLemma 23. Maintain the notation and assumptions of Proposition 22 and set T = \u03b1\u2208\u03a6 NG (U\u03b1 ).\nThen, for any positive roots \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 \u03a6+ , the inclusion ZT (U\u03b1 ) \u2282 ZT (U\u03b2 ) implies \u03b1 = \u03b2.\nProof. Let \u039b (resp. \u039b\u2228 ) be the lattice of algebraic characters (resp. cocharacters) of the maximal\nsplit torus T [R\u00e9m02b, \u00a78.4.3]. We may \u2013 and shall \u2013 identify the abstract root system \u03a6 to a\nsubset of \u039b and use the identification T \u2243 Homgroups (\u039b, K\u00d7 ). For \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a6, x \u2208 K and t \u2208 T , we\nhave:\n(\u2217\u2217)\n\nt.u\u03b1 (x).t\u22121 = u\u03b1 (t(\u03b1).x),\n\nwhere u\u03b1 : (K, +) \u2192 U\u03b1 is a standard isomorphism (see [Tit87, \u00a7 3]).\nAssume now that \u03b1 6= \u03b2. We claim that there exists \u03b3 \u2208 \u039b\u2228 such that h\u03b1 | \u03b3i = 0 and h\u03b2 | \u03b3i =\n6 0.\nLet us set k(\u03b1, \u03b2) = h\u03b1 | \u03b2 \u2228 ih\u03b2 | \u03b1\u2228 i. If k 6= 4, then it is easy to see that there exists such a \u03b3 in\nthe group Z\u03b1\u2228 + Z\u03b2 \u2228 . If k = 4, then the order of s\u03b1 s\u03b2 is infinite and we are in position to apply\nTheorem 14. This yields a non-degenerate infinite rank 3 root subsystem of \u03a6 containing \u03b1 and \u03b2.\nThen it is again easy to check the existence of \u03b3 inside this subsystem. In both cases, the claim\nabove holds. Given t \u2208 K\u00d7 , let t\u03b3 denote the element of T defined by t\u03b3 : \u03bb 7\u2192 th\u03bb | \u03b3i . Since K is\ninfinite, there exists some z \u2208 K\u00d7 such that z h\u03b2 | \u03b3i 6= 1. In view of (\u2217\u2217), it is now straightforward\nto check that z \u03b3 is an element of T which centralizes U\u03b1 but not U\u03b2 .\n\u0003\n5.2. Non-linearity. We can now state the main non-linearity theorem of this section. Note that it\nis known that Kac-Moody groups of indefinite type over infinite fields of arbitrary characteristic do\nnot admit any faithful finite-dimensional linear representation over any field [Cap05, Theorem 7.1],\nbut the simplicity for Kac-Moody groups over infinite fields is still an open question.\nTheorem 24. Let A be a generalized Cartan matrix, let GA be a Tits functor of type A and let K\nbe a field of characteristic p > 0. Assume that A is indecomposable, of indefinite type, i.e. neither\nspherical nor affine, that each rank one subgroup of GA (K) is perfect and that GA (K) is generated\nby its root subgroups. Then any finite-dimensional linear representation of GA (K) is trivial.\n26\n\n\fProof. We set G = GA (K) and we let \u03c6 : G \u2192 GLn (F) be any representation. If K is finite,\nthen \u03c6(G) is residually finite by Mal'cev's theorem. On the other hand G does not have any finite\nquotient by Corollary 16. Hence \u03c6(G) is trivial in this case.\nWe henceforth assume that K is infinite. Let us denote by Gp the group GA (Fp ) (where Fp is the\nprime field of K). We view Gp as a subgroup of G. By Mal'cev's theorem, \u03c6(Gp ) is residually\nfinite, so by Corollary 16 it is finite. Since the root system \u03a6 contains nilpotent subsets of arbitrary\nlarge cardinality, the kernel H of \u03c6 meets non-trivially the Fp -points of U\u03a8 for some nilpotent set of\nroots \u03a8. In particular, we have H \u2229 U\u03a8 6= {1}, which implies by Proposition 22 that H contains G\u2020 .\nSince the field K is infinite, we have G\u2020 = [G, G] because the rank one subgroups X\u03b1 = hU\u03b1 \u222a U\u2212\u03b1 i\nare perfect. The conclusion follows since [G, G] = G by hypothesis.\n\u0003\n6. Homomorphisms to topological groups\nIn this section we study homomorphisms from Kac-Moody groups to locally compact groups. In the\nfirst result, we collect some basic facts which show that the only interesting group homomorphisms\nfrom finitely generated Kac-Moody groups are those with totally disconnected target. However,\nthe main part of this section is devoted to proving that any nontrivial continuous homomorphism\nwhose domain is the topological completion of a twin building lattice is a proper map. This is a\nuseful result to be combined with superrigidity.\n6.1. Homomorphisms from simple discrete groups. We collect here some basic (and probably\nwell-known) facts about abstract group homomorphisms from simple discrete to locally compact\ngroups.\nProposition 25. Let \u039b be an infinite finitely generated group endowed with the discrete topology.\n(i) The group \u039b is residually finite if, and only if, there exists an injective homomorphism from\n\u039b to a compact group.\n(ii) If \u039b is simple (resp. simple and Kazhdan), any group homomorphism from \u039b to a compact\n(resp. amenable) group is trivial.\nWe henceforth assume that \u039b is simple.\n(iii) There exists no nontrivial group homomorphism from \u039b to a Lie group with finitely many\nconnected components.\n(iv) Let \u03c6 : \u039b \u2192 G be a nontrivial group homomorphism to a locally compact group G and let\n\u03c0 : G \u2192 G/G\u25e6 be the projection onto the group of connected components. Then \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03c6 is a\ncontinuous, injective, unbounded homomorphism.\n(v) Let X be a CAT(0) or hyperbolic proper metric space. Then if \u039b fixes a point, say \u03be, in the\nvisual boundary \u2202\u221e X, it stabilizes each horosphere centered at \u03be.\nPoint (i) was pointed out to us as a folklore result by N. Monod.\nProof. (i). By definition, a residually finite group injects in its profinite completion, so one direction\nis clear. Now let \u039b admit an injective homomorphism \u03c6 : \u039b \u2192 K into a compact group K and\nlet \u03bb \u2208 \u039b \u2212 {1}. The regular representation \u03c1K of K in L2 (K) is injective; we will use its PeterWeyl decomposition [HR70, Theorem 27.40]. The image \u03bb\u0304 of \u03bb in some suitable finite-dimensional\nirreducible submodule, say V , is nontrivial. The projection \u039bV of (\u03c1K \u25e6 \u03c6)(\u039b) to GL(V ) is a finitely\ngenerated linear group containing \u03bb\u0304. By Mal'cev's theorem [LS03, Window 7 \u00a74 Proposition 8], the\ngroup \u039bV is residually finite, so it admits a finite quotient in which \u03bb\u0304 is nontrivial: this is a finite\nquotient of \u039b in which the image of the arbitrary nontrivial element \u03bb is nontrivial.\n(ii). The case when \u039b is simple follows immediately from (i). We assume that \u039b is both simple\nand Kazhdan. Let \u03c6 : \u039b \u2192 P be a homomorphism to an amenable group P . The closure \u03c6(\u039b) is a\n27\n\n\fKazhdan group because so is \u039b [Zim84, Proposition 7.1.6] and it is amenable as a closed subgroup\nof P [Gre69, 2.3.2]. Therefore it is compact [Mar91, III.3 p.115] and it remains to apply the first\ncase of this point.\n(iii). Let \u03c6 : \u039b \u2192 G be a homomorphism to a Lie group with finitely many connected components.\nBy simplicity, the group \u039b has no finite index subgroup, so we are reduced to the case when G\nis connected. We compose this map with the adjoint representation of G, whose kernel is the\ncenter Z(G) [Bou72, III.6.4 Corollaire 4], in order to obtain a continuous homomorphism Ad \u25e6 \u03c6\nto the general linear group of the Lie algebra of G. This map is not injective since the group \u039b is\nsimple and finitely generated, hence non-linear. Therefore (Ad \u25e6 \u03c6)(\u039b) is trivial. Finally, again by\nsimplicity, we successively obtain \u03c6(\u039b) < Z(G) and \u03c6(\u039b) = {1}.\n(iv). By simplicity of \u039b, the map \u03c6 is injective since it is not trivial. Moreover the kernel of \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03c6 is\nequal to {1} or \u039b. We have to exclude the case when Ker(\u03c0 \u25e6 \u03c6) = \u039b. Let us assume the contrary,\ni.e. \u03c6(\u039b) < G\u25e6 , in order to obtain a contradiction. It follows from [MZ74, 4.6] that there exists\na compact normal subgroup K \u22b3 G\u25e6 such that G\u25e6 /K is a connected Lie group. Let us consider\np\n\u03c6\nthe composed map \u039b \u2212\u2192 G\u25e6 \u2212\u2192 G\u25e6 /K where p : G\u25e6 \u2192 G\u25e6 /K denotes the canonical projection.\nBy (iii) we have (p \u25e6 \u03c6)(\u039b) = {1} so \u03c6(\u039b) < K. It remains to apply (ii) to obtain the desired\ncontradiction. The unboundedness of \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03c6 follows from (ii) as well.\n(v). For each y \u2208 X, we denote by \u03b2\u03be,y the Busemann function \u03b2\u03be,y : X \u2192 R centered at \u03be\nand such that \u03b2\u03be,y (y) = 0 [BH99, II.8.17 and III.H.3]. We pick x \u2208 X and define the function\n\u03c6\u03be,x : \u039b \u2192 R by setting \u03c6\u03be,x (g) = \u03b2\u03be,x (g.x). Then for g, h \u2208 \u039b, we compute \u03c6\u03be,x (gh) \u2212 \u03c6\u03be,x (h),\ni.e. \u03b2\u03be,x (gh.x) \u2212 \u03b2\u03be,x (h.x) by definition. By equivariance, this is \u03b2\u03be,x (gh.x) \u2212 \u03b2g.\u03be,g.x(gh.x), that is\nalso \u03b2\u03be,x (gh.x) \u2212 \u03b2\u03be,g.x (gh.x) because \u03be is fixed under the \u039b-action. But the latter quantity is also\n\u03b2\u03be,x (g.x), i.e. \u03c6\u03be,x (g), by the cocycle property of Busemann functions. In other words, the function\n\u03c6\u03be,x is a group homomorphism from \u039b to (R, +). By simplicity of \u039b, it is trivial, from which we\ndeduce that x and g.x are on the same horosphere centered at \u03be for any g \u2208 \u039b and any x \u2208 X. \u0003\nNote that if in (v) we replace \u039b by a topologically simple group acting continuously on X, the\nsame conclusion holds (the argument is the same: the above map \u03c6\u03be,x is a continuous group\nhomomorphism).\n6.2. Diverging sequences in Coxeter groups. In the present subsection, we consider a Coxeter\nsystem (W, S) and the associated Davis complex A .\nWe say that a sequence (wn )n\u22650 of elements of W diverges if lim l(wn ) = +\u221e.\nn\u2192+\u221e\n\nLemma 26. Let (wn )n\u22650 be a diverging sequence in W . Given any x \u2208 A , there exists a root\nhalf-space \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a6(A ) and a subsequence (wnk )k\u22650 such that lim d(x, wnk .\u03b1) = +\u221e.\nk\u2192+\u221e\n\nProof. The sequence (wn )n\u22650 diverges if and only if so does (wn\u22121 )n\u22650 . Therefore, it suffices to find\na root \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a6 and a subsequence (wnk )k\u22650 such that lim d(wnk .x, \u03b1) = +\u221e. We set xn = wn .x.\nk\u2192+\u221e\n\nSince (wn )n\u22650 diverges, we have lim d(x, xn ) = +\u221e. Therefore (xn )n\u22650 possesses a subsequence\nn\u2192+\u221e\n\n(xnk )k\u22650 which converges to a point \u03be of the visual boundary \u2202\u221e A .\nLet \u03c1 : [0, +\u221e) \u2192 A be the geodesic ray such that \u03c1(0) = x and \u03c1(+\u221e) = \u03be. Since \u03c1 is unbounded\nand since chambers are compact, it follows that \u03c1 meets infinitely many walls of the Davis complex\nA . On the other hand, the ray \u03c1 is contained in finitely many walls, otherwise its pointwise\nstabilizer would be infinite, contradicting the fact that W acts properly discontinuously on A .\nTherefore, there exists a wall \u2202\u03b1 which meets \u03c1 and such that \u03c1 is not contained in it. This wall\n28\n\n\fdetermines two roots, one of which containing no subray of \u03c1. We let \u03b1 be that root: \u03b1 \u2229 \u03c1 is a\nbounded (nonempty) segment.\nSince \u03b1 is a closed convex subset of A , the map d(*, \u03b1) : A \u2192 R+ is convex [BH99, II.2.5] and so\nis f : R+ \u2192 R+ : t 7\u2192 d(\u03c1(t), \u03b1). Therefore, if f is bounded, it is constant and since \u03c1 meets \u03b1\nwe have f (t) = 0 for all t. This is excluded because by construction the ray \u03c1 is not contained in\n\u03b1. Thus f is an unbounded convex function and we deduce that lim d(\u03c1(t), \u03b1) = +\u221e. Finally,\nt\u2192+\u221e\n\nsince lim \u03c1(t) = lim xnk = \u03be, it follows that {xnk : k \u2265 0} is at finite Hausdorff distance from\nt\u2192\u221e\u0001\nk\u2192\u221e\n\u03c1 [0, +\u221e) . Therefore, we obtain lim d(xnk , \u03b1) = +\u221e as desired.\n\u0003\nk\u2192+\u221e\n\n6.3. Properness of continuous homomorphisms. We now settle our main properness result\nfor continuous group homomorphisms from topological completions of twin building lattices.\nTheorem 27. Let \u039b be a group endowed with a twin root datum {U\u03b1 }\u03b1\u2208\u03a6 of type (W, S) with finite\nroot groups, and such that \u039b = hU\u03b1 | \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a6i. Assume that W is infinite, that (W, S) is irreducible,\nthat all root groups are solvable and that property (FPRS) of Sect. 2.1 holds. Let \u039b+ be the positive\ntopological completion of \u039b and let \u03c6 : \u039b+ \u2192 G be a continuous nontrivial homomorphism to a\nlocally compact second countable group G. Then \u03c6 is proper.\nRemark. In view of the proof below, we can consider Proposition 4 and Lemma 26 as substitutes\nfor results such as the contracting or expanding properties of torus actions on root groups in the\nclassical algebraic group case [BM96, Lemma 5.3].\nProof. Let us assume that \u03c6 is not proper in order to obtain a contradiction. There exists a sequence\n(\u03b3j )j\u22650 eventually leaving every compact subset of \u039b+ and such that lim \u03c6(\u03b3j ) exists in G. Let us\nj\u2192+\u221e\n\nd\nd\nrecall that we can view the Weyl group W as the quotient N\nA /\u03a9A where NA = Stab\u039b+ (A+ ) and\nF\n\u03a9A = Fix\u039b+ (A+ ). We also have a Bruhat decomposition: \u039b = w\u2208W B+ wB+ , where B+ is the\nd\nIwahori subgroup B+ = Fix (c+ ). We use it to write \u03b3j = kj .nj .k\u2032 with kj , k\u2032 \u2208 B+ and nj \u2208 N\nA.\nj\n\n\u039b+\n\nj\n\nUp to passing to a subsequence, we may assume that (kj )j\u22650 and (kj\u2032 )j\u22650 are both converging in\nthe compact open subgroup B+ . We set wj = nj \u03a9A . The hypothesis on (\u03b3j )j\u22650 implies that\n(wj )j\u22650 is a diverging sequence in W and that lim \u03c6(nj ) exists in G. We denote this limit by\nj\u2192+\u221e\n\ng. In view of Lemma 26, up to passing to a subsequence, there exists a root \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a6(A+ ) such that\nlim d(c+ , wj .\u03b1) = +\u221e. Let u \u2208 U\u2212\u03b1 \u2212{1}. Recall that nj .u.n\u22121\nj \u2208 Uwj .(\u2212\u03b1) for all j. Therefore by\nj\u2192+\u221e\n\n(FPRS) we have:\n\n\u22121\n\u22121\nlim nj .u.n\u22121\n.\nj = 1. Applying \u03c6 we obtain: 1 = lim \u03c6(nj .u.nj ) = g.\u03c6(u).g\nj\u2192+\u221e\n\u2020\nthat \u039b+ <\n\nj\u2192+\u221e\n\nKer(\u03c6). Since \u039b = \u039b\u2020 by\nThus we have u \u2208 Ker(\u03c6). By Proposition 11(i), this implies\nassumption, it follows that \u03c6 is trivial, providing the desired contradiction: \u03c6 is proper.\n\u0003\n7. Superrigidity\nIn this section, we show that recent superrigidity theorems can be applied to twin building lattices.\nThey concern actions on CAT(0)-spaces. We also derive some consequences: non-linearity of irreducible cocompact lattices in some Kac-Moody groups, homomorphisms of twin building lattices\nwith Kac-Moody targets, restrictions for actions on negatively curved complete metric spaces.\n7.1. Actions on CAT(0)-spaces. The possibility to apply [Mon06] to irreducible cocompact lattices enables us to prove the following. Note that the existence of irreducible cocompact lattices in\nthis context is an open problem.\n29\n\n\fProposition 28. Let \u039b be a twin building lattice generated by its root groups {U\u03b1 }\u03b1\u2208\u03a6 , with\nassociated twinned buildings B\u00b1 . We assume that the Weyl group W is infinite, irreducible and\nnon-affine, that root groups are nilpotent and that Z(\u039b) = 1. Let \u0393 be an irreducible cocompact\nlattice in \u039b+ \u00d7 \u039b\u2212 . Then any linear image of \u0393 is finite.\nRemark. The important assumption here is irreducibility. Indeed, the twin buildings associated\nto some Kac-Moody groups are right-angled Fuchsian. For each of the two buildings B\u00b1 , the\ncompletion \u039b\u00b1 contains a cocompact lattice isomorphic to a convex cocompact subgroup of the\nisometry group of a well-chosen real hyperbolic space [RR06, 4.B]. Taking the product of two such\nlattices, we obtain a cocompact lattice in \u039b\u2212 \u00d7 \u039b+ which is linear over the real numbers.\nThe arguments are classical, so we only sketch the proof.\nProof. By Proposition 11(i), the groups \u039b\u00b1 are topologically simple. By [BS06, Corollary 1.4], it\nfollows that \u0393 is just infinite, i.e. all its proper quotients are finite. Hence any group homomorphism\nfrom \u0393 with infinite image is injective; the same holds for any finite index subgroup of \u0393. Let F be\na field with algebraic closure F and let n \u2265 2 be an integer such that there is an injective group\nhomomorphism \u03b7 : \u0393 \u2192 GLn (F). We must obtain a contradiction. Let H be the Zariski closure\nof \u03b7(\u0393) in GLn (F). We denote by \u0393\u25e6 the preimage by \u03b7 of the identity component H \u25e6 . It is a\nfinite index normal subgroup of \u0393, so as a lattice in \u039b\u2212 \u00d7 \u039b+ it is still irreducible because \u039b\u00b1 is\ntopologically simple. We denote by R(H \u25e6 ) the radical of H \u25e6 and by \u03c0 : H \u25e6 \u2192 H \u25e6 /R(H \u25e6 ) the\nnatural projection. Then \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03b7 is still injective since otherwise, by the normal subgroup property\nfor \u0393\u25e6 , the group \u0393 would be virtually solvable, hence amenable, while \u039b\u2212 \u00d7 \u039b+ is not. We\nthus obtain a semisimple group G over F and an injective group homomorphism \u03c6 : \u0393\u25e6 \u2192 G\nwith Zariski dense image. We choose an algebraic group embedding in some general linear group:\nG < GLr . Being cocompact, the lattice \u0393\u25e6 is finitely generated. Taking the matrix coefficients\nof the elements of some finite symmetric generating system implies that \u03c6(\u0393\u25e6 ) lies in GLr (E) for\nsome finitely generated field E. The group \u0393\u25e6 is finitely generated, linear and non-amenable so\nby Tits' alternative it contains a non-abelian free group [Tit72]. We can find an element with one\neigenvalue, say \u03bb, of infinite multiplicative order, so there is a local field K\u0302 with absolute value\n| * | and a field extension \u03c3 : E \u2192 K\u0302 such that | \u03c3(\u03bb) | =\n6 1. In particular, the subgroup \u03c6(\u0393\u25e6 )\nis unbounded in G(K\u0302). The map \u03c6 : \u0393\u25e6 \u2192 G(K\u0302) satisfies the two conditions required to apply\nMonod's superrigidity [Mon06, Corollary 4 and Lemma 59]: the homomorphism \u03c6 extends to a\ncontinuous homomorphism \u03c6\u0303 : \u039b\u2212 \u00d7 \u039b+ \u2192 G(K\u0302). By topological simplicity of \u039b\u00b1 , we obtain an\ninjective homomorphism \u039b \u2192 G(K\u0302), which is impossible since \u039b is infinite, virtually simple and\nfinitely generated, hence non-linear.\n\u0003\n7.2. Uniform p\u2013integrability. We now check an integrability condition (a substitute for cocompactness) required by [GKM06] for a lattice to enjoy superrigidity properties. Let us recall the\ncontext and the notation of this reference: G is a locally compact group, \u0393 is a lattice in G. We\nassume that \u0393 contains a finite generating subset \u03a3 and denote by | * |\u03a3 the length function on \u0393\nwith respect to it. Following [GKM06, Sect. 5], each time we have a right fundamental domain\n\u03a9 for \u0393, we define the function \u03c7\u03a9 : G \u2192 \u0393 by g \u2208 \u03c7\u03a9 (g)\u03a9. For each real number p > 1, we say\nthat \u0393 is p\u2013integrable if there is a right fundamental domain \u03a9 such that for any c \u2208 G, we have:\nZ\n(| \u03c7\u03a9 (gc) |\u03a3 )p dg < +\u221e. The main result of [R\u00e9m05] is that Kac-Moody lattices are p\u2013integrable\n\n\u03a9\n\nfor any p > 1. This amounts to saying that the function g 7\u2192 | \u03c7\u03a9 (gc) |\u03a3 belongs to Lp (\u03a9) for any\nc \u2208 G. We are interested in a stronger property. We denote by k * k\u03a9,p the Lp \u2013norm of measurable\nfunctions on \u03a9.\n30\n\n\fDefinition 29. Given p \u2208 [1; \u221e), the lattice \u0393 in G is called uniformly p\u2013integrable if there is a\nright fundamental domain \u03a9 as above such that for any compact subset C in G we have:\nZ\nsup\n(| \u03c7\u03a9 (gc) |\u03a3 )p dg < +\u221e,\nc\u2208C\n\n\u03a9\n\ni.e. the real valued function \u03c6\u03a9,p : c 7\u2192 k \u03c7\u03a9 (* c) k\u03a9,p is bounded on compact subsets of G.\nThe relation with Y. Shalom's condition [Sha00] is the following. Given a left fundamental domain\nD for the inclusion \u0393 < G, we can define a map \u03b1D : G \u00d7 D \u2192 \u0393 by setting \u03b1D (g, d) = \u03b3 if, and\nonly if, we have gd\u03b3 \u2208 D. Up to translating it, we may \u2013 and shall \u2013 assume that 1G belongs to D.\nThe set \u03a9 = D \u22121 is a right fundamental domain and the following equivalences hold:\n\u03b1D (g, 1G ) = \u03b3 \u21d0\u21d2 g\u03b3 \u2208 D \u21d0\u21d2 \u03b3 \u22121 g\u22121 \u2208 \u03a9 \u21d0\u21d2 g \u22121 \u2208 \u03b3\u03a9 \u21d0\u21d2 \u03b3 = \u03c7\u03a9 (g\u22121 ).\nIn other words, we have: \u03c7\u03a9 (g) = \u03b1D (g\u22121 , 1G ) and 2\u2013integrability amounts to Y. Shalom's condition\n(1.5) in [Sha00, 1.II p.14].\nLet us now turn to the specific case of twin building lattices. For the rest of the section, we let\n\u0393 = \u039b be a twin building lattice with twin root datum {U\u03b1 }\u03b1\u2208\u03a6 . We also let G = \u039b\u2212 \u00d7 \u039b+ . In\n[R\u00e9m05, 1.2] a left F\nfundamental domain D is defined by means of refined Tits systems arguments.\nIt is a union D = w\u2208W Dw , indexed by the Weyl group W , of compact open subsets Dw in G\nand we have 1G \u2208 D1W . For the rest of the subsection, \u03a3 denotes the finite symmetric generating\nsubset used in [RR06, Definition 1], i.e. the union of the rank one subgroups X\u03b1 * T = hU\u03b1 , U\u2212\u03b1 i * T\nindexed by the simple roots \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a0.\nTheorem 30. There exists a right fundamental domain \u03a9 such that for any p \u2208 [1; +\u221e) the\nfunction \u03c6\u03a9,p : c 7\u2192 k \u03c7\u03a9 (* c) k\u03a9,p is bounded from above by a function which is constant on each\nproduct of double cosets modulo the standard Iwahori subgroups in \u039b\u2212 and \u039b+ . In particular, twin\nbuilding lattices are uniformly p\u2013integrable for any p \u2208 [1; +\u221e).\nRemark. The second assertion implies the first one because the standard Iwahori subgroups B\u00b1\nare open and compact, so products of double cosets modulo Iwahori subgroups B+ w+ B+ \u00d7B\u2212 w\u2212 B\u2212\nare open and compact (and disjoint when distinct).\nProof. We first note that as for the normal subgroup property (Theorem 18), though the results\nin [R\u00e9m05] are stated for Kac-Moody groups, we can use them in the more general context of\nthe above statement thanks to Proposition 1(vi). Moreover since the groups \u039b\u00b1 have BN \u2013pairs,\nthey are unimodular [Bou81, IV.2.7]. Hence so is G. We denote by dg a Haar measure on G and\ncompute \u03c6\u03a9,p (c)p for c \u2208 G. It is:\nZ\nZ\nZ\n\u0001p\n\u0001p\n\u0001p\n| \u03b1D (c\u22121 g, 1G ) |\u03a3 dg.\n| \u03b1D (c\u22121 g \u22121 , 1G ) |\u03a3 dg =\n| \u03c7\u03a9 (gc) |\u03a3 dg =\n\u03a9\n\nD \u22121\n\nD\n\nThe first equality follows from the remarks before the statement and the Zlast equality from the\n\u0001p\nl\u03a3 \u03b1D (hg, 1G ) dg\nunimodularity of G. Therefore it is enough to check that the map h 7\u2192\nD\n\nis bounded from above by a function which is constant on products of double cosets modulo the\nstandard Iwahori subgroups B\u2212 and B+ , in \u039b\u2212 and \u039b+ respectively. We are now back to objects\nstudied in [R\u00e9m05]. An element h \u2208 G is a couple (h\u2212 , h+ ) with h\u00b1 \u2208 \u039b\u00b1 and we denote by L\u00b1 (h)\nthe combinatorial distance (i.e. the length of a minimal gallery) in the building B\u00b1 from the\nstandard chamber c\u00b1 to the chamber h\u22121\n\u00b1 .c\u00b1 . The function h 7\u2192 L\u00b1 (h) is constant on each double\ncoset of \u039b\u00b1 modulo the standard Iwahori subgroup of sign \u00b1 since L\u00b1 (h) is nothing but the length\nin W of the Weyl group element indexing the double class B\u00b1 h\u00b1 B\u00b1 . We set L(h) = L\u2212 (h) + L+ (h)\nand introduce the polynomial Qh defined in [R\u00e9m05, Lemma 17] by Qh (X) = 3X 2 + (6L(h) +\n31\n\n\f3)X + (3L(h)2 + 3L(h) + 1). Then by the proof of the main theorem of [loc. cit., p. 39] there exists\nX Qh (n)p\na constant | T | such that we have: \u03c6\u03a9,p (h)p \u2264 | T | *\n. We are done since h 7\u2192 Qh is\nqn\nn\u2208N\nconstant on the products of double cosets B+ w+ B+ \u00d7 B\u2212 w\u2212 B\u2212 .\n\u0003\nThe consequences of the above integrability property are the possibility to apply the various rigidity\nstatements of [GKM06]. One of them is explicitly stated in the introduction of the present paper.\nCorollary 31. Let \u039b be a twin building lattice. Then theorems 1.1, 1.3 and 1.4 of [GKM06,\nIntroduction] can be applied to \u039b.\nRemark. In this subsection, no assumption was made on the type of the Coxeter diagram of the\nWeyl group.\n7.3. Homomorphisms of twin building lattices with Kac-Moody targets. The purpose of\nthis subsection is to present a concrete application of superrigidity of twin building lattices, and\nmore specifically of Corollary 31. Recall that the main application of superrigidity of lattices in Lie\ngroups is arithmeticity, see e.g. [Mar91] and [Mon06]. In the context of twin building lattices, and\nin view of the simplicity theorem 19 and its corollaries, it is rather natural to apply superrigidity\nto homomorphisms with non-linear targets. The main result of this section is an example of such\nan application.\nLet (G, {U\u03b1 }\u03b1\u2208\u03a6 ) be a twin root datum of type (W, S), with finite root groups, such that the\ncentralizer ZG (G\u2020 ) is trivial, and let G+ be its positive topological completion. Since ZG (G\u2020 ) is the\nkernel of G+ -action on the associated building B+ , we may \u2013 and shall \u2013 view G+ as a subgroup\nof Aut(B+ ) (see Proposition 1(iii)).\nTheorem 32. Let \u039b be a twin building lattice of irreducible type, whose root groups are solvable,\nand such that \u039b is generated by the root groups and that property (FPRS) of Sect. 2.1 holds. Let\n\u03c6 : \u039b \u2192 G+ be a homomorphism with dense image. Assume that (W, S) is irreducible, nonspherical and 2\u2013spherical (i.e. any 2\u2013subset of S generates a finite group). Assume also that\nqmin = min{|U\u03b1 | : \u03b1 \u2208 \u03a6} > 3. Then \u03c6(\u039b) is conjugate to G\u2020 in Aut(B+ ). In particular G\u2020 is\nisomorphic to \u039b/Z(\u039b).\nProof. Details of the arguments involve some rather delicate considerations pertaining to the theory\nof twin buildings. Since a detailed proof would therefore require somewhat lengthy preparations\nwhich are too far away from the main topics of this paper, we only give a sketch.\nSince the G+ -action on the associated building B+ is strongly transitive and since \u03c6(\u039b) is dense in\nG+ , it follows that the \u039b-action on B+ induced by \u03c6 is reduced (in the sense of [Mon06]). By Corollary 31, we may therefore apply [GKM06, Theorem 1.1], which ensures that the homomorphism \u03c6\nextends uniquely to a continuous homomorphism \u039b+ \u00d7 \u039b\u2212 \u2192 G+ , factoring through \u039b+ or \u039b\u2212 .\nUp to exchanging + and \u2212, we assume that \u03c6 extends to a continuous homomorphism \u039b+ \u2192 G+ ,\nalso denoted \u03c6. Since \u03c6 is proper by Theorem 27, it follows that \u03c6 is surjective. Furthermore, by\nProposition 11(i) the kernel of \u03c6 is contained in the discrete center Z(\u039b+ ) = Z(\u039b).\nFor both \u039b+ and G+ , the maximal compact subgroups are precisely the maximal (spherical) parahoric subgroups. Moreover, since (W, S) is irreducible and 2\u2013spherical, a maximal parahoric subgroup of G+ has a Levi decomposition as semi-direct product L \u22c9 U , where L is a finite group of Lie\ntype and U is a pro\u2013p group for some prime p depending only on G (see [R\u00e9m04, Theorem 1.B.1(ii)]\nand Proposition 3(i)). Furthermore, in the decomposition L \u22c9 U, the hh congruence subgroup ii U\nis characterized as the maximal normal pro\u2013p subgroup. Using the fact that maximal parahoric\nsubgroups of \u039b+ also admit Levi decompositions, it is not difficult to deduce that the Levi factors\n32\n\n\fin \u039b+ are also finite groups of Lie type and, then, that \u03c6 induces isomorphisms between the Levi\nfactors in \u039b+ and in G+ . In view of the description of the respective buildings of the latter groups\nas coset geometries modulo parahoric subgroups, this in turn implies that \u03c6 induces an isomorphism between the building X+ of \u039b+ and the building B+ of G+ ; moreover this isomorphism is\n\u03c6\u2013equivariant. In particular X+ is of 2\u2013spherical irreducible type with infinite Weyl group. By\nassumption, the building X+ (resp. B+ ) admits a twin X\u2212 (resp. B\u2212 ) such that the diagonal\naction of \u039b (resp. G) on the product X+ \u00d7 X\u2212 (resp. B+ \u00d7 B\u2212 ) preserves the twinning. By the\nmain result of [MR95], these twinnings must be isomorphic since X+ and B+ are. More precisely,\nthese twinnings are conjugate under some element of Aut(B+ ). Up to conjugating \u03c6(\u039b) by this\nelement of Aut(B+ ), we may \u2013 and shall \u2013 assume that \u03c6(\u039b) preserves the twinning between B+\nand B\u2212 .\nSince the isomorphism between X+ and B+ is \u03c6\u2013equivariant, it follows from standard description\nof root group actions in Moufang twin buildings (see e.g. [Tit92]) that \u03c6 maps each root group\nof \u039b to a root group of G, and that every root group of G is reached in this manner. Since \u039b is\ngenerated by its root groups, we deduce that \u03c6(\u039b) = G\u2020 . Finally, since G\u2020 is center-free, so is \u03c6(\u039b),\nfrom which it follows that Ker(\u03c6) \u2229 \u039b = Z(\u039b).\n\u0003\n7.4. Actions on CAT(\u22121)-spaces. Another consequence is the existence of strong restrictions on\nactions of hh higher-rank ii Kac-Moody lattices on CAT(\u22121)-spaces. Of course, in this case we must\ndiscuss the notion of rank which is relevant to the situation; this is done just after the statement.\nSince we are dealing with hyperbolic target spaces, it is most convenient to use a superrigidity\ntheorem due to N. Monod and Y. Shalom [MS04].\nTheorem 33. Let \u039b be a split or almost split adjoint Kac-Moody group over Fq which is a lattice in\nthe product of the associated buildings B\u00b1 . We assume that the Weyl group W is infinite, irreducible\nand non-affine and that q \u2265 4. Let Y be a proper CAT(\u22121)-space with cocompact isometry group.\nWe assume that \u039b acts on Y by isometries and we denote by \u03c6 : \u039b \u2192 Isom(Y ) the corresponding\nhomomorphism.\n(i) If the \u039b-action is nontrivial but has a global fixed point in the compactification Y = Y \u2294\u2202\u221e Y ,\nthen the fixed point is unique and lies in the visual boundary \u2202\u221e Y .\n(ii) We assume that the \u039b-action has no global fixed point at all. Then there exists a nonempty,\nclosed, convex, \u039b-stable subset Z \u2286 Y on which it extends to a continuous homomorphism\n\u03c6\u0303 : \u039b\u2212 \u00d7 \u039b+ \u2192 Isom(Z) which factors through \u039b\u2212 or \u039b+ .\n(iii) We assume that the buildings B\u00b1 contain flat subspaces of dimension \u2265 2. Then the \u039baction, if not trivial, has a unique global fixed point in Y , which lies in the visual boundary\n\u2202\u221e Y .\n(iv) If the buildings B\u00b1 contain flat subspaces of dimension \u2265 2 and if \u039b is Kazhdan, then the\n\u039b-action is trivial.\nRemarks. 1. The assumption that Y has cocompact isometry group in the theorem is necessary.\nConsider indeed the minimal adjoint Kac-Moody group \u039b = GA (Fq ) over Fq , where A is the\ngeneralized Cartan matrix of size 4 defined by Aii = 2 for i = 1, . . . , 4 and Aij = \u22121 for 1 \u2264\ni 6= j \u2264 4. Thus the group \u039b satisfies all hypotheses of the theorem if q \u2265 4; furthermore \u039b has\nproperty (T) provided q > 17644 [DJ02]. The specificity is here that the Weyl group W is a Coxeter\ngroup which is a non-uniform lattice of SO(3, 1). In fact W acts on the real hyperbolic 3-space H3\nwith a non-compact simplex as a fundamental domain. It turns out that the whole building B+\nhas a geometric realization X in which apartments are isomorphic to the tiling of H3 by the above\nsimplex as fundamental tile. This geometric realization is a locally finite simplicial complex which\nadmits a global CAT(\u22121)\u2013metric induced by the metric of the apartments [AB, Proposition 11.31].\nHence, although the building B+ has 2\u2013dimensional flats in its usual geometric realization, the\n33\n\n\fCAT(\u22121)-space X is endowed with a natural \u039b-action which has no global fixed point in the visual\ncompactification X. The point is of course that chambers are not compact in X (while they are of\ncourse compact in B+ ), which implies that Isom(X) is not cocompact.\nNote that in the above example, the rank 2 Levi factors of \u039b are (virtually) nothing but arithmetic\ngroups SL3 (Fq [t, t\u22121 ]). The action of these subgroups on X induced by the \u039b-action has no global\nfixed points in X, which shows in particular that the assumption that Isom(Y ) has finite critical\nexponent is necessary in [BM96, Corollary 0.5] as well.\n2. The prototype of hh higher-rank versus CAT(-1) ii result we have in mind is [BM96, Corollary\n0.5]. In the latter case the target space is also a CAT(-1)-space without any required connection\nwith Lie groups, but the irreducible lattice lies in a product of algebraic groups. Then the fact\nthat each factor in the associated product of symmetric spaces and Bruhat-Tits buildings contains\nhigher-dimensional flats implies property (T) for the lattice. In the Kac-Moody case, the existence\nof higher-dimensional flats no longer implies property (T); this explains the distinction between\n(iii) and (iv).\n3. The notion of flat rank considered in [BRW05] for groups of building automorphisms is relevant\nhere. According to [CH06] and [BRW05, Theorem A], knowing whether the buildings B\u00b1 contain\nhigher-dimensional flat subspaces is equivalent to the fact that the groups \u039b\u00b1 are of flat rank\n\u2265 2 or, still equivalently, that the Weyl group contains a free abelian subgroup of rank \u2265 2. In\nparticular, the flat rank can be explicitly computed from the Dynkin diagram of the twin building\nlattice group \u039b.\n\nProof of Theorem 33. (i). We first note that the hypotheses (S0)\u2013(S3+) of Theorem 19 are fulfilled.\nMoreover \u039b = \u039b\u2020 and Z(\u039b) = 1 since \u039b is adjoint. Hence the group \u039b is simple. In particular, the\nnon-triviality of \u03c6 implies that it is injective. Moreover for any y \u2208 Y the stabilizer StabIso(Y ) (y) is\na compact group, so by Proposition 25 a nontrivial \u039b-action on Y cannot have any fixed point in\nY . Now let \u03be and \u03b7 be two distinct \u039b-fixed points in the visual boundary \u2202\u221e Y . Then the unique\ngeodesic (\u03b7\u03be) is stable and by simplicity of \u039b the restriction of the \u039b-action on (\u03b7\u03be) has to be trivial:\nthis implies the existence of a global fixed point in Y , which again is excluded when \u03c6 is nontrivial.\n(ii). Let us first show that the closure group \u03c6(\u039b) is non-amenable. Assume the contrary. Then\nthere is a probability measure \u03bc which is fixed by this group. Since the \u039b-action has no global\nfixed point in Y , the group \u03c6(\u039b) is not compact so by the CAT(\u22121) Furstenberg's lemma [BM96,\nLemma 2.3] the support of \u03bc contains at most two points. This support is \u039b-stable, so by simplicity\nit is pointwise fixed by \u039b; this is excluded because the \u039b-action has no global fixed point in \u2202\u221e Y .\nWe henceforth know that \u03c6(\u039b) is non-amenable. We apply [MS04, Theorem 1.3]: there exists a\ncompact normal subgroup M \u22b3 \u03c6(\u039b) such that the induced homomorphism \u039b \u2192 \u03c6(\u039b)/M extends\nto a continuous homomorphism \u039b\u2212 \u00d7 \u039b+ \u2192 \u03c6(\u039b)/M factoring through \u039b\u2212 or \u039b+ . Therefore,\nchoosing a suitable sign we obtain an injective continuous group homomorphism\n\u03c6\u0304 : \u039b\u00b1 \u2192 \u03c6(\u039b)/M .\nLet us denote by Z the fixed-point set of M in Y . The subset Z is nonempty because M is\ncompact, it is closed and convex by uniqueness of geodesic segments. Since M is normal in \u03c6(\u039b),\nthe subset Z is stable under the \u03c6(\u039b)-action. The restriction map rZ : \u03c6(\u039b) \u2192 Isom(Z) factors\nthrough the canonical projection \u03c0M : \u03c6(\u039b) \u2192 \u03c6(\u039b)/M and provides a natural homomorphism\nr\u0304Z : \u03c6(\u039b)/M \u2192 Isom(Z) which we can compose with \u03c6\u0304 to obtain the desired homomorphism\n\u03c6\u0303 = r\u0304Z \u25e6 \u03c6\u0304.\n34\n\n\f(iii). Let us assume that the \u039b-action has no fixed point in Y in order to obtain a contradiction.\nBy applying (ii), we have an injective continuous homomorphism \u03c6\u0303 : \u039b\u00b1 \u2192 Isom(Z) as above.\nMoreover Proposition 4 and Theorem 27 imply that \u03c6\u0303 is proper.\nRoot system preliminaries.- By the remarks before the proof, the existence of flats of dimension\n\u2265 2 implies the existence of an abelian subgroup isomorphic to Z \u00d7 Z in the Weyl group W .\nMoreover it follows from [Kra94, Theorem 6.8.3] that if W has a subgroup isomorphic to Z \u00d7 Z,\nthen it has a reflection subgroup isomorphic to D\u221e \u00d7 D\u221e , where D\u221e is the infinite dihedral group.\nLet \u03b1, \u03b1\u2032 , \u03b2, \u03b2 \u2032 \u2208 \u03a6 be roots such that \u03c4 = r\u03b1 r\u03b2 and \u03c4 \u2032 = r\u03b1\u2032 r\u03b2 \u2032 are mutually commuting and both\nof infinite order. Let V+ (resp. V\u2212 ) the group generated by the root groups indexed by roots in\nS\nn\nn\u2208Z \u03c4 .{\u03b1; \u2212\u03b2} (resp. by the opposite roots). Note that each of these two groups is normalized\nby any element lifting \u03c4 in N .\nReduction to hyperbolic isometries.- Recall that the torus T is finite, hence the fixed-point-set Y T\nof T in Y is nonempty. Thus Y T is a closed convex subset of Y on which the group N acts since N\nnormalizes T . Recall that the quotient N/T is nothing but the Weyl group W . Obviously T acts\ntrivially on Y T and, hence, the action of N on Y T factors through W . Therefore, we may \u2013 and\nshall \u2013 consider that W acts on Y T .\nLet us now pick n\u03c4 such an element, i.e. such that n\u03c4 T = \u03c4 in W = N/T . By properness of\n\u03c6\u0303, the group generated by \u03c6\u0303(n\u03c4 ) is unbounded, therefore the isometries \u03c6\u0303(n\u03c4 )\u00b11 are either both\nhyperbolic or both parabolic because n\u03c4 and n\u22121\n\u03c4 are mutually conjugate by r\u03b1 . We claim that we\nobtain the desired contradiction if we manage to prove that these isometries (as well as n\u03c4 \u2032 ) are\nhyperbolic. Indeed, \u03c4 together with \u03c4 \u2032 generate a free abelian group of rank 2 which acts on Y T .\nSince the group N is a discrete subgroup of \u039b+ (because it acts properly discontinuously on B+ )\nand since \u03c6\u0303 is proper, it follows that h\u03c4, \u03c4 \u2032 i acts freely on Y T . By the flat torus theorem [BH99,\nCorollary II.7.2], we deduce that Y T contains a 2-flat. This is absurd because Y is CAT(\u22121).\nFixed points of hh unipotent ii subgroups.- On the one hand, we claim that \u03c6\u0303(V\u00b1 ) cannot stabilize\nany geodesic line in Z. Indeed, any element g \u2208 V\u00b1 is torsion so it fixes a point in Z. If L were\na \u03c6\u0303(V\u00b1 )-stable geodesic line then, using orthogonal projection, \u03c6\u0303(g) would fix a point of L. This\nwould imply that the subgroup of index at most 2 in \u03c6\u0303(V\u00b1 ) fixing the extremities of L would in\nfact fix the whole line L: this is excluded because, by properness of \u03c6\u0303, the groups \u03c6\u0303(V\u00b1 ) are not\ncompact. On the other hand, the groups V\u00b1 are metabelian [R\u00e9m02a, 3.2 Example 2] so the closures\n\u03c6\u0303(V\u00b1 ) are amenable groups [Zim84, 4.1.13], hence fix a probability measure on \u2202\u221e Z. By [BM96,\nLemma 2.3] the support of such a measure contains at most two points. By the previous point, the\nsupport must consist of one single point at infinity and the same argument shows that this point\nis the unique \u03c6\u0303(V\u00b1 )\u2013fixed point in \u2202\u221e Z: we call it \u03b7\u00b1 .\nImages of translations are not parabolic.- Since n\u03c4 normalizes V\u00b1 and since (\u2202\u221e Z)\u03c6\u0303(V\u00b1 ) = {\u03b7\u00b1 },\nthe isometry \u03c6\u0303(n\u03c4 ) fixes \u03b7\u2212 and \u03b7+ . In order to see that \u03c6\u0303(n\u03c4 ) is hyperbolic, it suffices to show\nthat \u03b7\u2212 6= \u03b7+ . Let us assume that \u03b7\u2212 and \u03b7+ are the same boundary point, which we call \u03b7. We\nneed to obtain a very last contradiction. Let us consider the group H = hV\u2212 , V+ i, by definition\ntopologically generated by V\u2212 and V+ . It is non-amenable because, as a completion of a group with\ntwin root datum of type \u00c31 , it admits a proper strongly transitive action on a semi-homogeneous\nlocally finite tree. Theorem 27 implies that the maps \u03c6\u0303 and \u03c6\u0304 are proper. On the \u0001one hand,\nproperness of \u03c6\u0304 implies that the group \u03c6\u0304(H) is non-amenable and neither is \u03c0M \u22121 \u03c6\u0304(H) since \u03c0M\nis proper and surjective. On the other hand,\n\u0001 properness of \u03c6\u0303 implies that \u03c6\u0303(H) is a closed subgroup\nof Isom(Z), which implies that rZ\u22121 \u03c6\u0303(H) is a closed subgroup of Stab\u03c6(\u039b) (\u03b7). Moreover we have:\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03c0M \u22121 \u03c6\u0304(H) < rZ\u22121 \u03c6\u0303(H) , so the non-amenable group \u03c0M \u22121 \u03c6\u0304(H) is a closed subgroup of\n35\n\n\fStab\u03c6(\u039b) (\u03b7). The contradiction comes from the fact that StabIsom(Y ) (\u03b7) is amenable, since Isom(Y )\nacts co-compactly on Y [BM96, Propositions 1.6 and 1.7].\n(iv). The conclusion follows from (iii), the fact that StabIsom(Y ) (\u03be) is amenable for each \u03be \u2208 \u2202\u221e Y\n[BM96, Propositions 1.6 and 1.7] and the fact that \u039b, being infinite, simple and Kazhdan, admits\n\u0003\nno nontrivial homomorphism to an amenable group (Proposition 25).\nNote that the assumption that \u039b is Kazhdan might be superfluous in (iv). Indeed, we used it\nonly to exclude that possibility that \u03c6(\u039b) has a fixed point in \u2202\u221e Y and, hence, is amenable.\nBut this might also follow using only the fact that \u039b is infinite, finitely generated, simple and nonamenable as a discrete group: the question is to determine whether such a group admits a nontrivial\nhomomorphism into an amenable group. Recall from Proposition 25(ii) that every homomorphism\nof an infinite, finitely generated, simple and non-compact group to a compact group is trivial. This\nseems to suggest that the answer to the above question might be negative, which would imply in\nparticular that the conclusion of (iv) holds even without assuming that \u039b is Kazhdan.\n\nReferences\n[AB]\n[AB98]\n[Abr96]\n[AM97]\n[BH93]\n[BH99]\n[BM96]\n[BM01a]\n[BM01b]\n[Bou71]\n[Bou72]\n[Bou81]\n[BP95]\n[Bro98]\n[BRW05]\n[BS06]\n[BT72]\n[Cap05]\n[CER06]\n[CG99]\n\nP.
