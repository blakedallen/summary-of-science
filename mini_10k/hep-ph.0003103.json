I motivate and discuss non-minimal and non-universal models of supersymmetry and supergravity consistent with string unification at 1016 GeV.\nKeywords. Supersymmetry\n\n1. Introduction\nThe motivations for TeV scale supersymmetry (SUSY) [1] remain as good as ever:\n1. TeV scale SUSY cancels the quadratic divergences in the Higgs mass (hierarchy problem),\n2. TeV scale SUSY ensures that the gauge couplings meet at MGUT \u223c 1016 GeV.\n\nThe discovery of D-branes allows gravity live in extra dimensions not felt by the\ngauge forces, and permits the effective gravitational coupling GN E 2 to be unified\nwith the other gauge couplings at MGUT \u223c 1016 GeV [2]. It also opens a Pandora's box of many other higher-dimensional scenarios for the unification of gravity\nand gauge interactions, possibly at scales as low as 1 TeV [3]. However in many\nsuch scenarios there is no convincing explanation for the apparent merging of the\ngauge couplings at 1016 GeV. In this talk we shall therefore discuss scenarios consistent with conventional high energy gauge unification, and ignore all large compact\ndimension scenarios.\nSince the vacuum is not manifestly supersymmetric, it must be broken. Mechanisms for SUSY breaking may be classified according to the magnitude of the\ngravitino mass m3/2 :\n\u2022 m3/2 \u223c 1 TeV (gravity mediated [4])\n\u2022 m3/2 \u226a 1 TeV (gauge mediated [5])\n\u2022 m3/2 \u226b 1 TeV (anomaly mediated [6])\n\nThe three mechanism are illustrated schematically in Figs 1-3. In this talk we\nshall concentrate mainly on the gravity mediated scenario, with the soft masses\ngenerated from an effective supergravity (SUGRA) theory and, according to our\nprevious discussion, we assume these soft masses to be generated at a scale of about\n1016 GeV.\n1\n\n\fS.F.

Elements of a SUGRA theory\nAs indicated in Figs. 1-3 the superpotential and Kahler potential [4] have the form\nW = Whid + Wobs\nK = Khid + Kobs\n\n(1)\n\nand the Kahler function\nG = K/MP2 + ln |W/MP3 |2\n\n(2)\n\nwhen inserted into the F-terms of the SUGRA potential\nVF = MP4 eG [Gi (G\u22121 )ji Gj \u2212 3]\nwhere Gi =\n\n\u03b4G\n\u03b4\u03c6i ,\n\nGi =\n\norder parameter Fi =\nm23/2 =\n\n\u03b4G\n\u22121 k j\n)i Gk = \u03b4ij , leads to a hidden sector\n\u03b4\u03c6\u2217i , (G\n\u2212MP2 eG/2 (G\u22121 )ji Gj and a gravitino mass\n\n1\n< Kji Fi F \u2217j >= MP2 e<G>\n3MP2\n\n(3)\nSUSY breaking\n\n(4)\n\nwhere the last equality assumes < VF >= 0. Terms in the expansion of VF then\nlead to soft SUSY breaking masses in the observable sector depending on the details\nof the Kahler potential. The common feature of the models we consider is that the\ngravitino mass is m3/2 \u223c T eV which corresponds to a SUSY breaking scale in the\nhidden sector of < Fi >\u223c (3 \u00d7 1010 GeV )2 .\nIn minimal SUGRA the Kahler potential is postulated to have the form\nK = Khid + Q\u0303\u2217i Q\u0303i + . . .\n\n(5)\n\nwhere Q\u0303i represents one of the squarks or sleptons, which are thereby assumed\nto have diagonal metric and minimal kinetic terms. This results in universal soft\nscalar masses\nVsof t = m20 (Q\u0303\u2217i Q\u0303i + . . .)\n\n(6)\n\nwhere m20 = m23/2 , and universal soft trilinear parameters of order m3/2 proportional\nto the Yukawa couplings in the superpotential. If the gauge kinetic functions fa are\nindependent of a then this results in universal gaugino masses M1/2 of order m3/2\nat high energies.\nIn string theory the hidden sector consists of the dilaton S and moduli Ti , which\nget vacuum expectation values (VEVs) of order MP . Although the string mechanism of SUSY breaking is unclear it may be parametrised in terms of the F-terms\nof S, Ti [7],\n\u221a\nF S = 3m3/2 (S + S \u2217 ) sin \u03b8e\u2212i\u03b3S\n\u221a\nF i = 3m3/2 (Ti + Ti\u2217 ) cos \u03b8\u0398i e\u2212i\u03b3i\n(7)\n\nPramana \u2013 J. Phys., Vol. 54, No. 4, April 2000\n\n3\n\n\fS.F. King\nP 2\nwhere\n\u0398i = 1. The dilaton and moduli couple directly to the MSSM multiplets\nin a very complicated non-universal way in the Kahler potential\nT\n\nnQ1\n\nK = Khid + Q\u0303\u2217i Q\u0303i (T1 + T1\u2217 )\n\ni\n\nT\n\nnQ2\n\n(T2 + T2\u2217 )\n\ni\n\nT\n\nnQ3\n\n(T3 + T3\u2217 )\n\ni\n\nS\n\n(S + S \u2217 )nQi + . . .\n(8)\n\nwhere nTQ1i , etc. are the half-integer valued modular weights, whose i dependence\nleads to non-universality in the soft scalar masses,\nm2Qi = m23/2 (1 + 3 sin2 \u03b8nSQi + 3 cos2 \u03b8nTQai .\u03982a )\n\n(9)\n\nThe trilinears are similarly non-universal. The gauge kinetic functions in a Dbrane theory [7] involving gauge groups on intersecting 9-branes and 5-branes with\nf9 = S, f5a = Ta leads to gaugino masses\n\u221a\nM9 = 3m3/2 sin \u03b8e\u2212i\u03b3S\n\u221a\nM5i = 3m3/2 cos \u03b8\u0398i e\u2212i\u03b3i\n(10)\nThus if different standard model gauge factors are on different branes the generic\nexpectation is non-universal gaugino masses. In general the message is clear: from\na modern string perspective non-universality is the natural expectation.\n3. Fine-tuning in SUGRA models\nAn issue amongst SUSY phenomenologists at the moment is the absence of Higgs\nand superpartners at currently accessible experimental energies. Is this really a\nconcern? The question revolves around the issue of how much fine-tuning one is\nprepared to tolerate. Although fine-tuning is not a well defined concept, the general\nnotion of fine-tuning is unavoidable since it is the existence of fine-tuning in the\nstandard model which provides the strongest motivation for low energy supersymmetry, and the widespread belief that superpartners should be found before or at\nthe LHC. Although a precise measure of absolute fine-tuning is impossible, the\nidea of relative fine-tuning can be helpful in selecting certain models and regions\nof parameter space over others. It is useful to compare different models using a\ncommon definition of fine-tuning [8]\n\u0013\n\u0012\na \u2202MZ2\n(11)\n\u2206a = abs\nMZ2 \u2202a\nwhere a is an input parameter, and fine-tuning \u2206max is defined to be the maximum\nof all the \u2206a .\nIn a recent paper [9] we compared the fine-tuning of several different SUGRA\nmodels as listed below:\n1. Minimal supergravity\namsugra \u2208 {m20 , M1/2 , A(0), B(0), \u03bc(0)} ,\n4\n\nPramana \u2013 J. Phys., Vol. 54, No. 4, April 2000\n\n(12)\n\n\fNon-Minimal and Non-Universal Supersymmetry\nwhere as usual m0 , M1/2 and A(0) are the universal scalar mass, gaugino\nmass and trilinear coupling respectively, B(0) is the soft breaking bilinear\ncoupling in the Higgs potential and \u03bc(0) is the Higgsino mass parameter.\n2.

In all models, fine-tuning is reduced as tan \u03b2 is increased, with tan \u03b2 = 10\npreferred over tan \u03b2 = 2, 3. Nevertheless, the present LEP2 limit on the Higgs\nand chargino mass of about 100 GeV and the gluino mass limit of about 250 GeV\nimplies that \u2206max is of order 10 or higher.\nThe fine-tuning increases most\nsharply with the Higgs mass. The reasons for this are spelled out in the analytic\ntreatment in ref. [10].

King\nFrom these conditions the Z mass may be expanded in terms of high energy input\nparameters. For example for tan \u03b2 = 2.5 we find [10],\nMZ2\n= \u2212 .87 \u03bc2 (0) + 3.6 M32 (0) \u2212 .12 M22(0) + .007 M12(0)\n2\n\u2212 .71 m2HU (0) + .19 m2HD (0) + .48 (m2Q (0) + m2U (0))\n\n\u2212 .34 At (0) M3 (0) \u2212 .07 At (0) M2 (0) \u2212 .01 At (0) M1 (0) + .09 A2t (0)\n+ .25 M2(0) M3 (0) + .03 M1(0) M3 (0) + .007 M1(0) M2 (0)\n(21)\n\nIt is clear that M3 (0) dominates the right-hand side, so to reduce fine-tuning we\nshould make M3 (0) as small as possible. However M3 (0) cannot be made too small\notherwise the gluino mass becomes too light. More importantly M3 (0) contributes\nto the radiative corrections to the Higgs mass. For a given tree-level Higgs mass the\nexperimental bound implies a lower bound on M3 (0) which may be stronger than\nthat coming from the gluino mass bound. Moreover this bound grows exponentially\nwith the Higgs mass since the radiatively corrected Higgs mass includes the terms\n!\n2\n2\nm\nm\nt\u0303\nt\u0303\n2\n1\nm2h \u2248 MZ2 cos2 2\u03b2 + (34 GeV )2 ln\n+ ...\n(22)\nm4t\nand the product of stop masses may be expanded as\nm2t\u03031 m2t\u03032 \u2248 (170 GeV )4 + 26 M34(0) + 1.5 At (0) M33 (0)\n\u0001\n+ 2.5 m2Q (0) + 3.5 m2U (0) \u2212 2.1 m2HU (0) M32 (0)\n\n+ (134 GeV )2 m2Q (0) + (130 GeV )2 m2U (0) \u2212 (108 GeV )2 m2HU (0)\n\n+ (430 GeV )2 M32 (0) \u2212 (180 GeV )2 M2 (0)M3 (0)\n+ (180 GeV )2 At (0) M3 (0) \u2212 (59 GeV )2 A2t (0) \u2212 (65 GeV )2 \u03bc2 (0)\n+ (67 GeV )2 At (0) \u03bc(0) \u2212 (210 GeV )2 M3 (0) \u03bc(0)\n(23)\nTaken together Eqs.22 and 23 show that any shortfall in the tree-level contribution\nto the Higgs mass must be compensated by exponential increases in stop masses,\nwhich in turn involves exponential increases in M3 (0), and hence exponential increases in fine-tuning.\nThe Higgs fine-tuning curves are fairly model independent, and as the Higgs mass\nlimit rises above 100 GeV come to quickly dominate the fine-tuning. We conclude\nthat the prospects for the discovery of the Higgs boson at LEP2 are good. For\neach model there is a correlation between the Higgs, chargino and gluino mass, for\na given value of fine-tuning. For example if the Higgs is discovered at a particular\nmass value, then the corresponding chargino and gluino mass for each tan \u03b2 can be\nread off from Figs.4-7.\nThe new general features of the results may then be summarised as follows:\n\u2022 The gluino mass curves are less model dependent than the chargino curves,\nand this implies that in all models if the fine-tuning is not too large then the\nprospects for the discovery of the gluino at the Tevatron are good.\n\n8\n\nPramana \u2013 J. Phys., Vol. 54, No. 4, April 2000\n\n\fNon-Minimal and Non-Universal Supersymmetry\n\u2022 The fine-tuning due to the chargino mass is model dependent. For example\nin the no-scale model with non-universal gaugino masses and the D-brane\nscenario the charginos may be relatively heavy compared to mSUGRA.\n\u2022 Some models have less fine-tuning than others. We may order the models on\nthe basis of fine-tuning from the lowest fine-tuning to the highest fine-tuning:\nD-brane scenario < generalised no-scale SUGRA < mSUGRA < AMSB.\n\u2022 The D-brane model is less fine-tuned partly because the gaugino masses are\nnon-universal, and partly because there are large regions where \u2206m3/2 , \u2206\u03bc(0) ,\nand \u2206\u03b8 are all close to zero However in these regions the fine tuning is dominated by \u2206\u0398 , and this leads to an inescapable fine-tuning constraint on the\nHiggs and gluino mass.\n4. Can Supersymmetric Soft Phases Be the Source of all CP Violation?\nA further motivation for non-universal SUSY comes from the possibility that all of\nCP violation arises from the phases present on soft SUSY masses. With universal\nsoft masses this is impossible, but with non-universal soft masses it has recently\nbeen shown that even if the CKM phase is zero, it is possible to account for \u01eb\nand \u01eb\u2032 via gluino exchange diagrams involving left-handed down squarks mixing\nwith right-handed strange squarks via a complex soft mass term [11]. We have\nshown [12] that CP violation in the B sector may also arise from chargino-stop\nbox diagrams with a complex stop mixing mass. A particular structure is required\nto avoid excessive contributions from similar diagrams to \u01eb. An important feature\nis that only flavour independent phases (for example phases on the non-universal\ngaugino masses) are required. The model predicts sin 2\u03b2 = \u2212 sin 2\u03b1 which implies\nthat B \u2192 \u03c8KS and B \u2192 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 are related.

Conclusion\nWe have concentrated on conventional theories in which gauge unification occurs\nat a high energy scale 1016 GeV, and the possibility that full string unification,\nincluding gravity, occurs at this scale. We have further concentrated on the conventional scenario for SUSY breaking, namely gravity mediated SUSY breaking.\nIn this framework, non-universal soft SUSY masses are the natural expectation,\nand the absence of FCNC's remains an important challenge for SUSY. However\nthere are phenomenological advantages to having non-universal soft masses which\nwe have highlighted, namely the reductions in fine-tuning which arise from having\nM3 (0) < M2 (0), and also the resultant lowering of the prediction for \u03b1s (MZ ) in\nthis case. Also the possibility that all of CP violation could arise from flavourindependent phases of soft SUSY masses is interesting.\nThe particle mass most sensitive to fine-tuning is the lightest Higgs boson mass,\nwith fine-tuning growing exponentially with the Higgs mass. In this respect it is\nworth remembering that we have been assuming the MSSM based on two Higgs\ndoublets with a mass term \u03bcH1 H2 . In the next-to-minimal supersymmetric standard model (NMSSM) [13] the mass term \u03bc is replaced by the vacuum expectation\nvalue (VEV) of a Higgs singlet N , \u03bcH1 H2 \u2192 \u03bbN H1 H2 . In the NMSSM the lightest\nphysical CP even Higgs boson may be heavier than in the MSSM. The NMSSM\nalso solves the \u03bc-problem and opens the electroweak baryogenesis window which is\ntightly constrained in the MSSM by LEP bounds.\nAcknowledgements\nI wish to thank all the organisers, and participants for making this workshop stimulating and enjoyable.\n\nReferences\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n\n10\n\nP.
