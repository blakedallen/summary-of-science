These constructions give the most general method to deform the pointwise product on\nC \u221e (M ) into a noncommutative product \u2217, such that certain physical requirements are satisfied.\nThe product \u2217 corresponds to composition of operators in the ordinary framework of quantum\ntheory on a flat phase space, and is called (Groenewold-)Moyal product there [8, 13].\nWhat is missing in this formalism is the construction of a Hilbert space on which the resulting\nalgebra acts, i.e. the space of states. This is not really a problem from a conceptual point of\nview, because one can define states in a purely algebraic framework as positive linear functionals\non the algebra. In the present situation this is not completely straightforward, as deformation\nquantization usually does not produce well-behaved algebras, like C \u2217 algebras, but it might be\npossible to circumvent this problem. Once one has the states defined as functionals, one can also\ndefine representations of the algebra on Hilbert spaces, using the GNS construction [20].\nHowever, classical quantum mechanics on flat space features one more physical property, which\ncannot easily be incorporated into the deformation framework. The wave functions there have a\nprobability interpretation, e.g. in the position space representation |\u03c8(q)|2 is a density in space,\nwhose integral over some region \u03a9 \u2282 Rn gives the probability to find the particle in \u03a9. Another\nexample is the Fock space representation, where |\u03c8n |2 gives the probability that n quanta or particles\nwill be found in the state \u03c8. In principle\nthis information can be extracted from the expectation\nR\nvalues of suitable observables, e.g. \u03a9 |\u03c8(q)|2 dq = h\u03c7\u0302\u03a9 i\u03c8 , where \u03c7\u03a9 is the characteristic function of\n\u03a9 \u00d7 Rn (Rn = momentum space), and \u03c7\u0302\u03a9 its associated operator. The advantage of the classical\nformalism is really that the calculation of these expectation values becomes simple for a large class\nof observables.\nFor a long time the Hilbert space had therefore been considered as an essential ingredient of\nthe theory, and the attempts to define quantization rigorously on curved phase spaces focused on\nits construction. These ideas culminated in the theory of geometric quantization, which provides a\nmethod for the construction of a Hilbert space consisting of wave functions with the same probability\ninterpretation as in the flat case [21, 1]. This works for symplectic phase spaces, to which we restrict\nour attention in this article. It is however not possible to give a general construction of all the\nobservables in this framework, despite some promising ideas.\n1\n\n\fIt would therefore be desirable to unify these two constructions such that one obtains a representation of the deformed algebra A on the Hilbert space HP of geometric quantization. We will\nshow in the paper that the geometrical structures appearing in the two theories are indeed closely\nrelated, that A has a canonical representation on a Hilbert space different from but closely related\nto HP , and that this representation can be carried over to HP in an obvious way. However, one\nassumption has to be made, which is related to the parameters occurring in the separate theories.\nThis is not surprising; neither geometric nor deformation quantization are uniquely determined\nby the symplectic manifold (M, \u03c9), but depend on further structures. In geometric quantization\nthese are essentially a polarization of the tangent bundle, a metaplectic structure, and a so called\nprequantum line bundle. Deformation quantization enforces the choice of a symplectic connection\non M , although it can be shown that different connections lead to isomorphic algebras. We will see\nthat deformation quantization is also closely related to metaplectic structures, which gives the first\nhint at some relation between the two theories. Our assumption essentially gives a compatibility\ncondition between the polarization and symplectic connection.\nWe will study in detail the case of cotangent bundles T \u2217 Q, equipped with their canonical\nsymplectic form, and show that the compatibility condition has many solutions in this case, even\nafter fixing the polarization. Note that (at least at first sight) it would be much more desirable to\nfind a unique solution, in order to decrease the number of apparently arbitrary parameters occurring\nin the quantization process. For manifolds with a totally complex polarization the compatibility\ncondition does not even impose any restrictions on the connection.\nThere are two more advantages of geometric over deformation quantization. The latter often\nproduces an infinite series for the observables, whose convergence properties are poorly understood,\nwhereas the geometric operators are quite simple. What we will find in the case of cotangent\nbundles is that although our final quantum operators are constructed from the formal deformation\noperators, they are actually perfectly well defined for a large class of functions.\nFurther, there may exist inequivalent irreducible representations of the quantum algebra, and\nthe different physical content of these representations often becomes at least partly obvious in the\ngeometric quantization scheme, whereas it may be hard to extract this information from a state\ndefined as a functional on the algebra.\nOur notation will be a bit sloppy at times. Instead of dealing with triples S(Rn ) \u2282 L2 (Rn ) \u2282\nwhere S denotes Schwartz functions, and S \u2032 the dual space consisting of tempered distributions, we only work with the Hilbert space L2 (Rn ), and pretend e.g. that it contains a deltafunction. This is in order to keep the notation simple, but it should not be difficult to translate\nthe results into rigorous statements.\nIn the first chapter we present a construction of the metaplectic group as a subgroup of the Weyl\nalgebra. The conventional approach is to work in a fixed representation of the latter, such that\nthe metaplectic group action becomes unitary. This is not really a restriction, as all irreducible\nrepresentations are equivalent, by the Stone-von Neumann theorem. In order to demonstrate\nthe importance of polarizations in the representation theory of the Weyl algebra and metaplectic\ngroup (thus giving a purely mathematical argument why geometric and deformation quantization\nbelong together) we choose to work in a somewhat more formal setting here, and construct the\nrepresentations only at the end of the section.\n\nS \u2032 (Rn ),\n\n2\n\n\f2\n\nThe Metaplectic Group\n\n2.1\n\nFormal construction\n\nLet (V, \u03c9) be a real, 2n dimensional, symplectic vector space, and\nSp(V, \u03c9) = {S \u2208 Aut(V ) | \u03c9(Sv, Sw) = \u03c9(v, w) \u2200v, w \u2208 V }\nthe symplectic group of V , with Lie algebra\nsp(V, \u03c9) = {A \u2208 End(V ) | \u03c9(Av, w) + \u03c9(v, Aw) = 0 \u2200v, w \u2208 V }.\n(2.1)\nL\nConsider the symmetric tensor algebra Sym(VC\u2217 ) = k\u22650 Symk (VC\u2217 ) on the dual V \u2217 . In the following\nwe will simply write vw = wv for the symmetrized tensor product v \u2297S w, if v, w \u2208 Sym(VC\u2217 ).\nSymmetrization is understood with factors, e.g. vw = 12 (v \u2297 w + w \u2297 v) for v, w \u2208 V \u2217 . Now we\nintroduce a new product \u25e6 on Sym(VC\u2217 ) by dividing out from the full tensor algebra T (VC\u2217 ) the\nideal generated by elements v \u2297 w \u2212 w \u2297 v \u2212 i~\u03c9 \u22121 (v, w), where v, w \u2208 VC\u2217 . For the time being ~\ncan be considered as a positive real number. The resulting space is indeed isomorphic as a vector\nspace to Sym(VC\u2217 ), as any of its elements can be brought to a symmetric form by reordering. In\nparticular we get\ni~\n(2.2)\nv \u25e6 w = vw + \u03c9 \u22121 (v, w), \u2200v, w \u2208 VC\u2217 ,\n2\nas well as the 'canonical commutation relation'\n[v, w]\u25e6 = i~\u03c9 \u22121 (v, w),\n\n\u2200v, w \u2208 VC\u2217 .\n\n(2.3)\n\nDefinition 2.1. The Weyl algebra associated to (V, \u03c9) is W (V \u2217 ) := Sym(VC\u2217 , \u25e6).\nChoose a basis {e1 , . . . , e2n } of V , and let {y 1 , . . . , y 2n } be the dual basis of V \u2217 \u2282 W (V \u2217 ). The\nWeyl operators W (a) \u2208 W (V \u2217 ) are defined as\no\nni\na = ai ei \u2208 V,\n(2.4)\n\u03c9ij ai y j ,\nW (a) = exp\u25e6\n~\nand a formal application of the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula shows that\nh i\ni\nW (a) \u25e6 W (b) = W (a + b) exp\n\u03c9(a, b) .\n2~\n\n(2.5)\n\nTherefore the Weyl operators W (a) form a group H(V, \u03c9), called Heisenberg group, which can be\ndefined abstractly as V \u00d7 R with composition\n\u0001\n(2.6)\n(v, s)(w, t) = v + w, s + t + 12 \u03c9(v, w) .\nIt is a central extension of the translation group V . We define a map\ndU : sp(V, \u03c9) \u2192 Sym2 (VC\u2217 ), A 7\u2192 \u2212\n\ni\n\u03c9ij Aj k y i y k ,\n2~\n\n(2.7)\n\nand observe that for A \u2208 sp(V, \u03c9) the expression \u03c9ij Aj k is symmetric in i and k, so that (2.7) can\ni\nalso be written as dU (A) = \u2212 2~\n\u03c9ij Aj k y i \u25e6 y k , which simplifies the proof (that we skip) of\nLemma 2.2. dU : sp(V, \u03c9) \u2192 W (V \u2217 ) is a Lie algebra homomorphism, i.e. for any A, B \u2208 sp(V, \u03c9)\nthe relation\n[dU (A), dU (B)]\u25e6 = dU ([A, B])\n(2.8)\nholds.\n3\n\n\f\u0001\nDefinition 2.3. The metaplectic\u0001 Lie algebra is mp(V, \u03c9) := dU sp(V, \u03c9) , and the metaplectic\ngroup Mp(V, \u03c9) = exp\u25e6 mp(V, \u03c9) .\n\nAs dU is injective, mp(V, \u03c9) is isomorphic to sp(V, \u03c9), but the associated Lie groups are not. It is\nknown that the metaplectic group forms a two-fold covering group of Sp(V, \u03c9), but it is not the\nuniversal cover, as \u03c01 (Sp(V, \u03c9)) = Z [6]. Any faithful representation of Mp(V, \u03c9) must be infinitedimensional, although it is a finite-dimensional Lie group. To S = eA \u2208 Sp(V, \u03c9) we associate\nU (S) \u2208 Mp(V, \u03c9) through U (S) = edU (A) , and note that U (S) is only defined up to a sign by S.\nLemma 2.4. For A \u2208 sp(V, \u03c9) and S \u2208 Sp(V, \u03c9) the following relations hold\n1. [dU (A), y i ]\u25e6 = \u2212Ai j y j\n2. U (S) \u25e6 y i \u25e6 U (S)\u22121 = (S \u22121 )i j y j\n3. W (Sa) = U (S) \u25e6 W (a) \u25e6 U (S)\u22121 ,\n\n\u2200a \u2208 V\n\nProof.\n1. is a direct consequence of the definition of dU and the commutation relation (2.3).\n2. follows from 1, and\n3. from 2:\no\no\nni\n\u03c9ij (Sa)i y j = exp\u25e6\n\u03c9ij ai (S \u22121 )j k y k\n~\n~\no\nni\n\u03c9ij ai y j \u25e6 U (S)\u22121 .\n= U (S) \u25e6 exp\u25e6\n~\n\nW (Sa) = exp\u25e6\n\n2.2\n\nni\n\nRepresentations\ni\n\nIn an irreducible unitary representation of H(V, \u03c9) the central elements (0, t) act as scalars e ~ t .\nThe Stone-von Neumann theorem (see e.g. [6]) states that up to unitary equivalence there is only\none unitary representation of H(V, \u03c9) for fixed ~. Such a representation \u03c1 gives rise to one of the\nWeyl algebra, where the action of the generators y i \u2208 V \u2217 is determined by\n\u03c1(y i )\u03c8 = \u2212i~\u03c9 ij\n\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n\nt=0\n\n\u03c1(tej , 0)\u03c8,\n\ncf. (2.4). The induced representation of Mp(V, \u03c9) can be obtained more directly as follows. For\nS \u2208 Sp(V, \u03c9) define another representation of H(V, \u03c9) on the same Hilbert space through\n\u03c1S (v, t) = \u03c1(Sv, t).\nAccording to Stone-von Neumann \u03c1 and \u03c1S are unitarily equivalent, thus we can find V (S) \u2208 U (H)\ns.t.\n\u03c1(Sv, t) = V (S)\u03c1(v, t)V (S)\u22121 .\n(2.9)\nObviously V (S) is not uniquely determined by S. We are going to show that it is unique up to a\nphase. Suppose that \u1e7c (S) satisfies equation 2.9 as well, then\n[\u1e7c (S)\u22121 V (S), W (a)] = 0\n4\n\n\u2200a \u2208 V,\n\n\fand Schur's lemma implies \u1e7c (S)\u22121 V (S) \u2208 C1. We have\n\nV (S)V (T )W (a)V (T )\u22121 V (S)\u22121 = V (ST )W (a)V (ST )\u22121 ,\n\nand uniqueness of V (ST ) up to a phase implies\nV (S)V (T ) = c(S, T )V (ST ),\n\nc(S, T ) \u2208 S 1 .\n\n(2.10)\n\nIt is not possible to eliminate the phase c(S, T ) completely, but it can always be chosen to be \u00b11\n[6], and comparison with equation 3 of Lemma 2.4 leads us to conclude that V (S) = \u03c1(U (S)).\nThe map Sym(V \u2217 ) \u2192 W (V \u2217 ) assigning to a polynomial on V its element in the Weyl algebra is the\nquantization map on the flat phase space (V, \u03c9). The essence of our discussion on the metaplectic\nand Heisenberg group is that the symmetry group V \u22ca Sp(V, \u03c9) of classical mechanics is replaced by\nits central extension H(V, \u03c9)\u22caMp(V, \u03c9) in quantum mechanics. \u22ca denotes the semidirect product,\nand Mp(V, \u03c9) acts on H(V, \u03c9) by the adjoint action: U (S)\u22c6W (a) = U (S)\u25e6W (a)\u25e6U (S)\u22121 = W (Sa).\nExample 2.5 (Schr\u00f6dinger representation). We construct a representation of the Weyl algebra,\nfollowing the well-known construction of spin representations of the Clifford algebra. Let P be\na Lagrangian subspace of V , meaning that its symplectic complement P \u22a5 = {v \u2208 V | \u03c9(v, p) =\n0 \u2200p \u2208 P } equals P . Define P \u266d = {\u03c9(p, *) | p \u2208 P } \u2282 V \u2217 . One can now introduce Darboux\ncoordinates q i , pj on V \u2217 , such that P \u266d is spanned by the q i . The representation space is Sym(PC\u266d ),\ni.e. the space of complex polynomials in the q i , and the action is determined by\n\u03c3(q)\u03c8 = q\u03c8\n\n(2.11)\n\n\u03c3(p)\u03c8 = [p, \u03c8]\u25e6 ,\nfor q \u2208 PC\u266d , p \u2208 Q\u266dC := span{p1 , . . . , pn }, and \u03c8 \u2208 Sym(PC\u266d ). Note that choosing different coordinates\np\u2032j = pj + Ajk q k does not change the representation because [q k , \u03c8]\u25e6 = 0, so it really depends only\non P \u266d , and not on the complementary subspace Q\u266d .\n(2.11) is then extended to the whole Weyl algebra by requiring \u03c3 to be a homomorphism w.r.t. the\nWeyl product (2.2). Observe that for a basis element pi one obtains the well-known Schr\u00f6dinger\noperator ~i \u2202qi .\nIn our Darboux coordinates adapted to the decomposition V = Q \u2295 P the\n\u0012 symplectic\u0013 form is\nA\nB\n\u03c9 = dpj \u2227 dq j . An element X \u2208 sp(V, \u03c9) can then be represented as X =\n, where\nC \u2212AT\nA, B, C \u2208 gl(n, R), B T = B, C T = C.

Let P \u2282 VC be a Lagrangian subspace again,\nw.r.t. the complexified symplectic form, such that P \u2229 P = {0}. Then we can introduce complex\ncoordinates z j , z j on VC\u2217 such that P \u266d is spanned by the z j , and \u03c9 assumes the complex standard\n\u266d\n\nform idz j \u2227 dz j . The representation space is Sym(P ), i.e. the space of holomorphic polynomials.\nThe action of W (V \u2217 ) is determined by\n\u03b2(z)\u03c8 = z\u03c8,\n\u03b2(z)\u03c8 = [z, \u03c8]\u25e6 ,\n5\n\n(2.14)\n\n\fleading to \u03b2(z j ) = ~ \u2202z\u2202 j . Elements of the symplectic Lie algebra again take the form X =\n\u0012\n\u0013\nA\nB\nw.r.t. the splitting VC = P \u2295 P , where A, B, C \u2208 gl(n, R), B = B T , C = C T .\nC \u2212AT ,\nThe ones respecting also the complex structure are\n\u0012\n\u0013\nA\n0\nX=\n,\nA \u2208 gl(n, R),\n(2.15)\n0 \u2212AT ,\nand form a u(n)-algebra. The Fock space representation of the metaplectic algebra becomes\n~\n\u2202\n\u22022\n1\n1\n\u03b2(dU (X)) = \u2212 Bab a b \u2212 Aab z b a \u2212 tr A + Cab z a z b .\n2\n\u2202z \u2202z\n\u2202z\n2\n2~\n\n(2.16)\n\n\u266d\n\nThe representation spaces Sym(P ) in these examples consist of polynomial functions on a subset\nof V . It is now possible to let W (V \u2217 ) act on more general functions, e.g. Schwartz functions\nS(Q) \u2282 L2 (Q) in the real case, Q \u223c\n= Rn . We would like to find a suitable function space endowed\nwith an inner product, such that the representations of H(V, \u03c9) and Mp(V, \u03c9) \u2282 W (V \u2217 ) become\nunitary. This will certainly be the case if the elements of V \u2217 act as self-adjoint operators on a\ncommon invariant, dense domain, which can be accomplished by the choice L2 (Q, dn q) in the real\n2\ncase, and L2hol (V, e\u2212|z| /~dn zdn z) in the complex one, where the index hol denotes restriction to\nholomorphic functions. Is there a systematic way to find the inner product? The answer is yes,\nand the method is geometric quantization, where the inner product plays the role of a Hermitian\nstructure on the prequantum bundle B, determined by the condition that a given connection on\nB has to be metric. See section 4. It is interesting to note that in the holomorphic case the\nHilbert space is indeed spanned by polynomials in z, whereas in the real one it is not spanned by\npolynomials in q.\n\n2.3\n\nWeyl bundle and metaplectic structures\n\nOn a symplectic manifold (M, \u03c9) one has a symplectic vector space (Tm M, \u03c9m ) over every point\nm \u2208 M . One can then form the infinite-rank Weyl bundle W, consisting of the collection of\n\u2217 M ). Associated to W (or T M ) is a principal R2n \u22ca Sp(2n) bundle (Sp(2n) denotes\nWm := W (Tm\n2n\nSp(R , dpi \u2227 dq i )), which can be lifted to a principal H(2n)\u22ca Mp(2n) bundle if the second StiefelWhitney class w2 (M ) vanishes. Then a unitary representation \u03c1 of H(2n) induces one of H(2n)\u22ca\nMp(2n) and gives rise to an associated Hilbert bundle H on M , such that W \u2282 End(H).\n\n2.4\n\nAnalogy to the spin group\n\nThe metaplectic group is the symplectic analogue of the spin group. Let (V, g) be a metric vector\nspace, then its associated Clifford algebra Cl(V \u2217 ) is, as a vector space, the antisymmetric tensor\nalgebra \u039bVC\u2217 . The Clifford product is defined by\nv\u25e6w =\n\n1\n1\nv \u2227 w + g\u22121 (v, w),\n2\n2\n\n\u2200v, w \u2208 V \u2217 ,\n\nwhich should be compared to the Weyl product (2.2). The isomorphism from\nso(V, g) = {A \u2208 End(V ) | g(Av, w) + g(v, Aw) = 0 \u2200v, w \u2208 V }\nto the spin algebra is given by\ndS : so(V, g) \u2192 spin(V, g), A 7\u2192\n6\n\n1\ngab Ab c \u03b3 a \u25e6 \u03b3 c ,\n2\n\n\fwhere the \u03b3 i are basis elements of V \u2217 , and thus satisfy {\u03b3 i , \u03b3 j } := \u03b3 i \u25e6 \u03b3 j + \u03b3 j \u25e6 \u03b3 i = gij . The\nanalogue of Lemma (2.4) is given by\n[dS(A), \u03b3 i ]\u25e6 = \u2212Ai j \u03b3 j\nand its exponentiated form. The representations of Cl(V \u2217 ) can be obtained in a manner similar to\nthe Fock representation of W (V \u2217 )\n\n3\n\nDeformation Quantization\n\nWe describe deformation quantization of symplectic manifolds according to Fedosov [4, 5]. Let\n(M, \u03c9) be a 2n-dimensional symplectic manifold. Our goal is the construction of a star product \u2217\non C \u221e (M ), i.e. a deformation of the ordinary point-wise product of functions on M . It turns out\nthat we will have to consider ~ as a formal deformation parameter here. E.g. instead of C \u221e (M )\nwe have to deal with\nX\nC \u221e (M )[[~]] = {\n~k ak | ak \u2208 C \u221e (M )},\nk\u22650\n\nP\nwhere no sort of convergence property is imposed on the series k ~k ak . The results of section\n2 will have to be interpreted in this sense as well then. In the following we will simply denote\nC \u221e (M )[[~]] by C \u221e (M ), and analogously for other structures.\nThe following conditions are to be satisfied by \u2217:\nP\nP\n1. the coefficients ck of the product of f = k ~k fk and g = k ~k gk :\nf \u2217g =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n~k ck (f, g)\n\nk=0\n\nare bi-differential operators (of finite order).\n2. c0 (x) = f0 (x)g0 (x)\n3. the correspondence principle\n[f, g]\u2217 = f \u2217 g \u2212 g \u2217 f = i~{f0 , g0 } + O(~2 ),\nholds, where {f, g} = \u03c9 \u22121 (df, dg) = \u03c9 ab \u2202a f \u2202b g denotes the poisson bracket defined by \u03c9.\n\n3.1\n\nThe Fedosov connection\n\n\u2217 M ), whose elements have the\nIn every point m \u2208 M we can form the Weyl algebra Wm = W (Tm\nform\nX\n~k fk;l1,...,lr y l1 . . . y lr\nk,r\u22650,\n\n(including a sum over the li ), with multiplication determined by (2.2). The collection of local Weyl\nalgebras Wm forms the Weyl bundle W, whereas in the flat case M = V there was only one Weyl\nalgebra and representation. We want to get rid of these extra algebras by identifying 'neighboring'\nWeyl algebras, which can be done by introducing a flat connection on W. Choose a symplectic\nconnection \u2207 on T M , i.e. one satisfying \u2207\u03c9 = 0 for the induced connection on T \u2217 M \u2297 T \u2217 M , with\nvanishing torsion. Symplectic connections always exist, but contrary to the Riemannian case they\n7\n\n\fare not unique. It induces a connection on the whole tensor algebra of M , in particular one on W =\nSym(T \u2217 M ), through the Leibniz formula.\nIn local Darboux coordinates \u2207 can be decomposed as\n\u0001\n\u2207 = d + \u0393, where \u0393 \u2208 \u03a91 U ; sp(2n) is a Lie algebra valued 1-from. Its components are defined by\n\u0393kij ek = \u0393(ei ) * ej , in the local Darboux basis {ei } of T M . Further we define \u0393ijk = \u03c9il \u0393ljk , which is\nsymmetric in all indices due to \u2207 being torsion-free and symplectic. The curvature of \u2207 is defined\nas R = \u22072 \u2208 \u03a92 (M ; T \u2217 M \u2297 T M ), with components\ni\nm\nRi jkl = \u2202k \u0393ilj \u2212 \u2202l \u0393ikj + \u0393ikm\u0393m\nlj \u2212 \u0393lm \u0393kj ,\n\n(3.1)\n\nand Rijkl = \u03c9im Rm jkl is symmetric in the first two (Lie algebra) indices, and antisymmetric\n\u2217 M by y i\nin the last two (differential form) indices. We denote the local basis elements of Tm\ni\nwhen considered as elements of the Weyl algebra Wm , and by dx when considered as elements\n\u2217 M . Differential forms with values in the Weyl bundle are sections of\nof the exterior algebra \u039bTm\n\u2217\n\u03a9(W) = \u0393(W \u2297 \u039bT M ). Note that, as a vector bundle, W \u2297 \u039bT \u2217 M is just the full tensor bundle\nof M . On \u03a9(W) we write \u25e6 for \u25e6 \u2297 \u2227, and use the graded commutator\n[\u03be, \u03b7] = \u03be \u25e6 \u03b7 \u2212 (\u22121)pq \u03b7 \u25e6 \u03be,\nfor \u03be, \u03b7 differential forms of degree p, q respectively, with values in W. The connection is extended\nto \u03a9(W) through\n\u2207(\u03be \u25e6 \u03b7) = \u2207\u03be \u25e6 \u03b7 + (\u22121)q \u03be \u25e6 \u2207\u03b7,\n\n\u2207(\u03c6 \u2227 \u03b7) = d\u03c6 \u2227 \u03b7 + (\u22121)q \u03c6 \u2227 \u2207\u03b7,\nExplicitly we have\n\u2207y i1 . . . y ik = \u2212\n\nX\n\n\u03be \u2208 \u0393(W \u2297 \u039bq )\n\u03c6 \u2208 \u03a9q (M ).\n\ni\n\n\u0393abj y i1 . . . y\u0306 ij . . . y ik y a dxb ,\n\nj\n\nwhere y\u0306 ij means omitting the element, and which can be written in the form\n\u2207 = d + [dU (\u0393), *] = d \u2212\n\ni\n\u0393ijk [y i y j , *]dxk .\n2~\n\n(3.2)\n\nHere dU is the isomorphism between the symplectic and metaplectic Lie algebras (2.7). Now we\nintroduce two further operators on \u03a9(W):\n\u03b4 = dxk \u2227\n\n\u0010 \u2202 \u0011\n\u03b4\u2217 = y k \u03b9\n,\n\u2202xk\n\n\u2202\n,\n\u2202y k\n\n(3.3)\n\nk\nk\nwhere\n\u0011y denotes multiplication with y (w.r.t. the symmetric tensor product), and the contraction\n\u0010\n\u03b9 \u2202x\u2202 k acts only on the form part. In brief, \u03b4 replaces one of the y i by dxi , whereas \u03b4\u2217 replaces\n\ndxi by y i . One easily checks\nLemma 3.1.\n1. \u03b42 = (\u03b4\u2217 )2 = 0\n\n2. Applied to y i1 . . . y il dxj1 \u2227 * * * \u2227 dxjp the following identity holds:\n\u03b4\u03b4\u2217 + \u03b4\u2217 \u03b4 = (l + p)id.\n\n8\n\n(3.4)\n\n\fWe also define \u03b4\u22121 by\n\u03b4\u22121 =\n\n1 \u2217\n\u03b4\nl+p\n\n(3.5)\n\nfor l + p > 0, and \u03b4\u22121 = 0 otherwise. If the projection of an element \u03be \u2208 \u03a9(W) to its part in\nC \u221e (M ) \u2282 \u03a9(W) is denoted by \u03be00 , then the following decomposition holds, analogously to the\nHodge-de Rahm decomposition of forms:\n\u03be = \u03b4\u03b4\u22121 \u03be + \u03b4\u22121 \u03b4\u03be + \u03be00 .\nDefinition 3.2. The ~-degree of a homogeneous element\nX\n~k \u03bek;i1,...,il ,j1,...,jm y i1 . . . y il dxj1 \u2227 * * * \u2227 dxjm\nm\n\n(3.6)\n\n\u2208 \u03a9(W)\n\n(3.7)\n\n(no sum over k, l) is defined as k + l/2.\nFrom its definition (2.2) it follows that \u25e6 respects the gradation on W defined by the ~-degree.\nThe subspaces of homogeneous elements of ~-degree j are denoted by Wj . Now W carries two\ngradations, the other one being defined by the degree in Sym(TC\u2217 M ), which is respected by the\nsymmetric tensor product, but not by \u25e6. The corresponding projections are\n\u03c0~j : W \u2192 Wj ,\n\nk\n: W \u2192 Symk (TC\u2217 M ),\n\u03c0\u2297\n\nand\n\n(3.8)\n\n0 (\u03be) by \u03be . It is important to note that \u03b4 decreases\nand we also adopt the convention to denote \u03c0\u2297\n0\n\u2217\nthe ~-degree by 1/2, whereas \u03b4 increases it.\nNow we come to the construction of a flat connection on W, with curvature \u03a9 = ~i [\u03c9, *] = 0. The\nansatz\ni\ni\nD = \u2207 + [\u03b3, *] = d + [dU (\u0393) + \u03b3, *],\n(3.9)\n~\n~\n\nwith an as yet undetermined 1-form \u03b3 \u2208 \u03a91 (W), leads to the curvature \u03a9 = D 2 = ~i [\u03a9\u0303, *], where\ni\n\u03a9\u0303 = R\u0302 + \u2207\u03b3 + \u03b3 2 .\n~\n\n(3.10)\n\nHere R denotes the curvature 2-form of \u2207, R\u0302 = ~i dU (R) = \u2212 41 Rijkl y i y j dxk \u2227dxl , and \u03b3 2 = \u03b3 \u25e6\u03b3. Of\ncourse, \u03b3 is only determined up to addition of a scalar form. We require the normalization \u03b30 = 0.\nIn the flat case M = R2n with standard symplectic form \u03c9 = dpi \u2227 dq i we can choose \u0393 = 0, and\n\u03b3 = \u03c9ab y b dxa leads to \u03a9\u0303 = \u03c9. Therefore, in the general case we split \u03b3 as\n\u03b3 = \u03c9ab y b dxa + r.\n\n(3.11)\n\nObserving that \u03b4 can be written in the form \u03b4\u03be = \u2212 ~i \u03c9ab dxa [y b , \u03be], we obtain for the curvature\ni\n\u03a9\u0303 = \u03c9 + R\u0302 \u2212 \u03b4r + \u2207r + r 2 ,\n~\nso that \u03a9\u0303 = \u03c9 becomes equivalent to\ni\n\u03b4r = R\u0302 + \u2207r + r 2 .\n~\n\n(3.12)\n\nTheorem 3.3 (Fedosov). Under the condition \u03b4\u22121 r = 0, eq. (3.12) has exactly one solution r.\n9\n\n\fSketch of proof. For a 1-form we have r00 = 0, which together with the condition \u03b4\u22121 r = 0 implies\nthat the decomposition (3.6) takes the form r = \u03b4\u22121 \u03b4r. Applying \u03b4\u22121 to (3.12) leads to\n\u0010\ni \u0011\n(3.13)\nr = \u03b4\u22121 R\u0302 + \u03b4\u22121 \u2207r + r 2 .\n~\nAs \u2207 preserves the ~-filtration, whereas \u03b4\u22121 increases the degree by 1/2, it follows by iteration that\n(3.13) has exactly one solution. The iteration steps are\nr (3) = \u03b4\u22121 R\u0302,\n\n\u0001\ni\nr (n+1) = \u03b4\u22121 R\u0302 + \u03b4\u22121 \u2207r (n) + (r (n) )2\n~\n\nmod ~n/2+1 ,\n\n(3.14)\n\nand r = limn\u2192\u221e r (n) . Here mod ~n/2+1 means discarding all terms of ~-degree at least n/2 + 1.\nThese terms are not stable under iteration yet, and it is convenient, although not necessary, to\nignore them. The condition \u03b4\u22121 r = 0 is fulfilled due to (\u03b4\u22121 )2 = 0. For the proof that r indeed\nsolves (3.12) we refer to Fedosovs texts [4, 5].\nThe first iteration gives\n1  \u0303\n1\ni j k m\nl\nr (4) = \u2212 Rijkl y i y j y k dxl \u2212 \u2207\nm Rijkl y y y y dx\n8\n40\n\n(3.15)\n\n \u0303 is the product connection on W \u2297 \u039b, thus acts the same way on y i and dxi .\nwhere \u2207\n\n3.2\n\nObservables and star product\n\nHaving constructed a flat connection on W we want to identify the quantum operators with the\nset of flat sections of W with respect to D, i.e. those satisfying D f\u02c6 = 0.

For a 0-form f\u02c6 we have \u03b4\u22121 f\u02c6 = 0 and f\u02c600 = f\u02c60 , so that the decomposition (3.6)\nbecomes f\u02c6 = f\u02c60 + \u03b4\u22121 \u03b4f\u02c6. Then equation (3.16) implies\n\u0001\ni\nf\u02c6 = f\u02c60 + \u03b4\u22121 \u2207f\u02c6 + [r, f\u02c6] .\n~\n\n(3.17)\n\nAgain this equation has a unique solution, which can be determined by iteration:\nf\u02c6(0) = f\u02c60 = f,\n\n\u0001\ni\nf\u02c6(n+1) = f\u02c60 + \u03b4\u22121 \u2207f\u02c6(n) + [r, f\u02c6(n) ] mod ~n/2+1 .\n~\n\n(3.18)\n\nFor the proof that f\u02c6 indeed solves (3.16) we again refer to [4, 5].\nThe first iterations give:\n1\n1\nf\u02c6(3) = f + y k \u2207k f + y j \u2207j y k \u2207k f + y i \u2207i y j \u2207j y k \u2207k f\n2\n6\n1\n+ Rabcd \u03c9 ck \u2202k f y a y b y d\n24\n10\n\n(3.19)\n\n\fAn explicit calculation of the covariant derivatives shows that in third order one has\n1\nf\u02c6(3) = f + \u2202k f y k + \u03c9jl (\u2207k Xf )l y j y k +\n2\n\u0003\n1\n1\u0002\n+ \u03c9jl (\u2207i \u2207k Xf )l + \u0393ijl (\u2207k Xf )l \u2212 Rijkl Xfl y i y j y k ,\n6\n4\n\n(3.20)\n\nwhere Xf is the Hamiltonian vector field of f , defined by Xf (g) = \u03c9 \u22121 (dg, df ). Note that a solution\nof the equation D f\u02c6 = 0 is not uniquely determined by its value at a point m \u2208 M . This value is\ndetermined by the Taylor series of f at m, which does not fix f .\nThe quantization map\n0 \u22121\n(\u03c0\u2297\n) : C \u221e (M ) \u2192 \u0393D (W), f 7\u2192 f\u02c6\nallows for the definition of a star product on C \u221e (M ), namely\n0 \u02c6\nf \u2217 g := \u03c0\u2297\n(f \u25e6 \u011d).\n\n(3.21)\n\nUsing the explicit expression (3.20), as well as the relation\n0\n(y a1 y a2 . . . y ak \u25e6 y i1 y i2 . . . y ik ) =\n\u03c0\u2297\n\n\u0010 i~ \u0011k X\n2\n\n\u03c9 a1 i\u03c0(1) . . . \u03c9 ak i\u03c0(k) ,\n\n(3.22)\n\n\u03c0\u2208Sk\n\nwe arrive at\n\ni~\n~2\n\u03c9(Xf , Xg ) + (\u2207j Xf )b (\u2207b Xg )j + O(~3 ).\n(3.23)\n2\n4\nThe conditions for a star product mentioned at the beginning of the section are easily checked,\nusing the fact that the Poisson bracket can be expressed as {f, g} = \u03c9(Xg , Xf ).

Now \u0393D (W) is our\nalgebra of quantum observables, and it is natural to conjecture that the physical states are sections\nof H. But again \u0393(H) is too large, and we need a way to identify different fibres of H. The most\nobvious way to do this would be by means of a flat connection, as in the case of the observables\n[16]. The connection form of D on W is given by a commutator, i.e. D = d + [A, *], where\ni\ni\ni\ni\nA = dU (\u0393) + \u03b3 = \u03c9ij y j dxi \u2212 \u03c9ij \u0393jkl y i y l dxk \u2212 Rijkl y i y j y k dxl + . . . ,\n~\n~\n2~\n8~\n\n(3.26)\n\nfrom (3.9), implying that D is the induced connection of DH = d + A on H.

We will find out how to get a flat connection in section 5.\n\n11\n\n\f4\n\nGeometric Quantization\n\nGeometric quantization is a prescription for constructing a Hilbert space HP (the space of states)\non a symplectic manifold, as well as a few quantum operators acting on it. Our main reference for\nthe material presented here is Woodhouse's book [21].\n\n4.1\n\nThe Hilbert space\n\nHP is not uniquely determined by (M, \u03c9) but depends on further structure:\n\u2022 a 'prequantum bundle' B \u2192 M , i.e. a Hermitian line bundle over M , with metric connection\n\u2207B of curvature \u2212 ~i \u03c9.\n\u2022 a metaplectic structure H \u2192 M .\n\u2022 a polarization, i.e. a strongly integrable ([21], p.92) Lagrangian subbundle P \u2282 TC M , Lagrangian meaning that\n\u22a5\nPm\n:= {v \u2208 TmC M | \u03c9(v, p) = 0 \u2200p \u2208 Pm }\n\nequals Pm . In particular this implies rkC P = 21 dimR M .\nExistence of B implies the condition [\u03c9/2\u03c0~] \u2208 H 2 (M, Z), whereas the metaplectic structure exists\niff the second Stiefel-Whitney class w2 (M ) of M vanishes. We will assume these conditions to be\nsatisfied, although they can be slightly weakened for pure geometric quantization, see [18], or [21],\np. 233. The existence problem for polarizations is quite subtle, and not completely solved as it\nseems. In particular there are symplectic manifolds that do not admit any polarization at all [7].\nDifferent prequantum bundles correspond to distinct physical situations, e.g. different magnetic\nmonopole charges, or different vacuum \u03b8-angles [14]. The same might be true for the metaplectic\nstructure, but it is not obvious how to interpret the polarization; it is usually claimed that 'most'\npolarizations can be considered as equivalent, but this seems not to be possible for all of them, and\nis definitely not in the infinite-dimensional case, as demonstrated by Shale's theorem [19, 17].\nSuppose a choice of the above mentioned structures (B \u2192 M, H \u2192 M, P ) has been made. The\npolarization can be transferred to the cotangent bundle through\n\u266d : TC M \u2192 TC\u2217 M, X \u266d (Y ) = \u03c9(Y, X) = \u03c9ab Y a X b .\nExample 4.1 (Real Polarizations). Suppose P is the complexification of a subbundle of T M . In\nthis case we have P \u2229 P = P , the polarization is called real, and one can locally find Darboux\ncoordinates (q 1 , . . . , q n , p1 , . . . , pn ) on M (i.e. \u03c9 = dpi \u2227 dq i ) such that\nP = span{\u2202pi | i = 1, . . . , n},\n\nP \u266d = span{dq j | j = 1, . . . , n}.\n\nThese coordinates are said to be adapted to P . Define Qm = span{\u2202qi | i = 1, . . . , n}, then the local\nHilbert space Hm from the metaplectic structure is the Schr\u00f6dinger representation space L2 (Qm )\non which dq j |m , dpi |m \u2208 Wm act as the standard Schr\u00f6dinger operators q\u0302 j , p\u0302i .\nExample 4.2 (Complex Polarizations). Suppose P \u2229 P = {0}, or equivalently P \u2295 P = TC M . In\nthis case the polarization is called totally complex, and defines a complex structure J on M in the\nfollowing way. Split X \u2208 T M as X = Z + Z, where Z \u2208 P , and define JX = iZ \u2212 iZ.\n\n12\n\n\fWe assume that the associated symmetric bilinear form g(X, Y ) := \u03c9(X, JY ) is positive definite,\nand therefore gives (M, \u03c9) the structure of a K\u00e4hler manifold. One can then choose complex\ncoordinates z a on M , s.t.\nP = span{\u2202z a | a = 1, . . . , n},\n\nP \u266d = span{dz a | a = 1, . . . , n},\n\nand \u03c9 assumes the standard form \u03c9 = i\u2202\u2202K for some real valued function K \u2208 C \u221e (M ), the so\ncalled K\u00e4hler potential. If \u03c9m = iKab dz a \u2227 dz b |m , then the local Hilbert space Hm is the Fock\na b\nspace L2hol (Tm M, e\u2212Kab w w /~dwdw), where wa are the induced coordinates on Tm M . dz a |m and\nb\n\n\u2202\ndz b |m act on Hm as multiplication with wa and differentiation \u0175 = ~K ab \u2202w\na respectively, where\na\nab\nas usual K are the matrix elements of the inverse matrix. In particular we have (\u0175a )\u2020 = \u0175 .\n\nThe so called canonical line bundle K P on M associated to P has fibre\n\u2217\nP\nM | \u03b9X \u03b1 = 0 \u2200X \u2208 P m },\n= {\u03b1 \u2208 \u039bn TmC\nKm\n\n(4.1)\n\nwhere \u03b9X denotes contraction with X. In the real case K P is spanned (locally) by dn q, in the\ncomplex one by dn z. Its definition requires a reduction of the structure group Sp(2n) of M to the\nsubgroup preserving the polarization. For real polarizations the corresponding Lie algebra elements\nhave the form (2.12), where A can be restricted to so(n), as it is always possible to reduce to a\nmaximal compact subgroup. Then K P has structure group Z2 , which we assume to be further\nreducible to the trivial group. In the complex case the Lie algebra of the structure group is u(n),\nspanned by elements (2.15), and K P has structure group U (1).\nFurther we need a square root of K P , i.e. a line bundle \u2206P such that \u2206P \u2297 \u2206P = K P . Such a\nsquare root exists iff M admits a metaplectic structure; we will describe how this comes about at\nP\nthe end of this section. Elements\nroots of n-forms. In the real\n\u221a nof \u2206 will be denoted by\u221asquare\nP\ncase \u2206 is spanned locally by d q, in the complex one by dn z.\nNow we introduce the partial connection on \u2206P , which only allows differentiation in P -direction.\nIt is just the exterior derivative restricted to P -vectors:\n\u2207X \u03bd = X(\u03bd)\n\nX \u2208 \u0393(P ), \u03bd \u2208 \u0393(\u2206P ).\n\n(4.2)\n\nThat the r.h.s. is well-defined can be seen from the fact that \u2207 is induced by a partial connection\non KP , which coincides with the exterior derivative acting on \u03a9n (M ) there. Consult [21] for details.\nDefinition 4.3. Let E \u2192 M be a vector bundle with (partial) connection. A section \u03c8 of E is\ncalled polarized if \u2207X \u03c8 = 0 for any X \u2208 \u0393(P ), and the set of polarized sections is denoted \u0393P (E).\nIf we want to emphasize the dependence on \u2207 we also write \u0393P ;\u2207 (E). Further we define polarized\nfunctions to be elements of\nCP\u221e (M ) = {f \u2208 C \u221e (M ) | X(f ) = 0 \u2200X \u2208 \u0393(P )}.\n\u0393P (E) is a CP\u221e (M )-module. Let P, P \u2032 be two polarizations, and E, F vector bundles with connections. Then one can take the tensor product \u0393P (E)\u2297\u0393P \u2032 (F ) in the category of CP\u221e\u2295P \u2032 (M )-modules.\nHowever, the resulting space can be made into a CP\u221e\u2229P \u2032 (M ) module, which we also denote by the\ntensor product. One easily checks that\n\u0393P (E) \u2297 \u0393P \u2032 (F ) \u2282 \u0393P \u2229P \u2032 (E \u2297 F ).\n\n(4.3)\n\nP\nWe only cite here the result that there is an isomorphism \u2206P \u2297 \u2206 \u223c\n= \u03c0 \u2217 \u2206(M/D), where D =\n(P \u2229 P ) \u2229 T M , the space of maximal connected integral manifolds of D is denoted by M/D, and\n\n13\n\n\f\u2206(M/D) is the density bundle on M/D. One should think of its sections (called densities) as\nabsolute values of differential forms of top degree, which can be integrated over M/D. \u03c0 : M \u2192\nM/D is the projection. We assume here and in the following that D has constant rank, and M/D\nis an orientable manifold. In the real case D has rank n, for totally complex polarizations D is\ntrivial and M/D = M . The isomorphism of line bundles induces one on the level of sections:\n\u0001\nP\n\u0393P \u2229P (\u2206P \u2297 \u2206 ) \u2192 \u0393 \u2206(M/D) ,\n\n(4.4)\n\nwhich, due to (4.3), gives rise to a sesquilinear pairing\n\n\u0001\n(*, *) : \u0393P (\u2206P ) \u00d7 \u0393P (\u2206P ) \u2192 \u0393 \u2206(M/D) .\n\nThe restriction to polarized sections is needed to ensure that the resulting section of \u03c0 \u2217 \u2206(M/D) is\nconstant\nthe\nIn the real case we\n\u221a of \u2206(M/D).\n\u221a\n\u221a nintegral nmanifolds of D, and so defines a section\n\u221a on\nn\nn\nn\nhave ( d q, d q) = |d q|, in the complex situation we get ( d z, d z) = (det g)1/4 dn z \u2227 dn z,\nP\nwhere the factor (det g)1/4 comes from\u221athe canonical\ntrivialization of \u2206P \u2297 \u2206 , determined by the\n\u221a\nglobal, nonvanishing section (det g)1/4 dn z \u2297 dn z. For the general case see [21], p.230-234.\nOn \u2206P \u2297 B we have the product partial connection, and consider the set of polarized sections\n\u0393P (\u2206P \u2297 B).

Suffice it to say that only a\nvery limited class of functions on M can be quantized in the traditional formalism of geometric\nquantization, in the real case these are the functions which are affine-linear in the momentum:\nf (q, p) = \u03b1(q) + \u03b2 i (q)pi . The corresponding quantum observable is an operator on HP (unbounded\nin general). We can choose a local trivialization in which the connection on\u221aB takes the form\n\u2207B = d \u2212 ~i \u03b8, where \u03b8 = pi dq i . Wave functions can then be represented as \u03c8 \u2297 dn q, where \u03c8 is a\nfunction of q alone, the operators are the canonical ones\nq\u0302 j (a \u2297\n\np\n\ndn q)(q) = q j a(q) \u2297\n\np\n\ndn q,\n\np\u0302j (a \u2297\n\np\n\ndn q)(q) = \u2212i~\n\np\n\u2202\na(q)\n\u2297\ndn q,\n\u2202q j\n\n(4.7)\n\nand the function \u03b2 i (q)pi is mapped to the symmetrized product of the operators \u03b2 i (q\u0302) and p\u0302i .\nOn a K\u00e4hler manifold we have \u03c9 = i\u2202\u2202K, a symplectic\n\u221a potential is \u03b8 = \u2212i\u2202K, B is a holomorphic\nline bundle, and wave functions take the form \u03c8(z)\u2297 dn z.

The situation\nturns out however to be essentially different for real and totally complex polarizations.\nReal polarizations\n\nIn this case (\u2206P )\u22121 can be identified with the subbundle\n{\u03c8 \u2208 H | y\u03c8 = 0 \u2200y \u2208 P \u266d } \u2282 H,\n\n(4.10)\n\nwhere we consider y \u2208 T \u2217 M as an element of the Weyl algebra W \u2282 End(H). The space P \u266d is\nspanned by the q\u0302 j , Hm is the Schr\u00f6dinger representation space L2 (Qm ), where Qm \u2282 Tm M is\nspanned by the \u2202q\u2202 j , and (\u2206P )\u22121 is generated by the \u03b4-function. The latter transforms as\n1\n\u03b4 7\u2192 tr(A)\u03b4\n2\nunder a symplectic gauge transformation of T M of the form (2.12), which can be seen from (2.13).\nNote that this is the right transformation behavior for (\u2206P )\u22121 .\nK\u00e4hler polarizations In the complex case Hm is the Fock representation space consisting of\nj\nholomorphic functions on Tm M , and P \u266d is spanned by the \u1e91 , which act as differentiation operators.\nTherefore the (vacuum) line bundle\n{\u03c8 \u2208 H | y\u03c8 = 0 \u2200y \u2208 P \u266d },\n\n(4.11)\n\nis spanned by the constant functions on Tm M , which transform under an (infinitesimal) symplectic\ntransformation of the form (2.15) as\n1\nc 7\u2192 \u2212 tr(A)c,\n2\naccording to (2.16). But this is the transformation behavior of \u2206P itself, which we therefore identify\nwith (4.11).\nNote that the constant holomorphic functions act like multiples of a delta function in Fock space:\nif \u03c9m has standard form idz j \u2227 dz j , then the inner product on the local Fock space Hm also has\nstandard form, and the inner product of a constant function c with \u03c8 \u2208 Hm gives\nZ\n2\nhc, \u03c8i Hm = c\n\u03c8(z)e\u2212|z| /~dn zdn z = \u03c0~c\u03c8(0).\n(4.12)\nTm M\n\n5\n5.1\n\nThe Full Quantization\nPairing\n\nHaving constructed the quantum algebra A = (C \u221e (M ), \u2217) through deformation quantization, as\nwell as the quantum Hilbert space HP through geometric quantization, it is natural to ask whether\none can define a representation of A on HP . If this is possible, the question arises whether one\nobtains the same operators for functions that are also quantizable in geometric quantization. As A\nand HP depend on several parameters, the answer to the questions above might depend on them\nas well.\nRecall that in the two quantization schemes the following structures occur:\n\n15\n\n\fgeometric quantization\nmetaplectic structure H \u2192 M\npolarization P\nprequantum bundle B \u2192 M ; curvature \u2212 ~i \u03c9\nline bundle \u2206P\n\ndeformation quantization\nmetaplectic structure H \u2192 M\nsymplectic connection \u2207\nconnection DH (\u2207) on H; curvature ~i \u03c9\n\nIn the pure deformation case we did not know how to define states, because the connection on\nH was not flat. Now there is one obvious solution, to consider the product with the prequantum\nbundle: H \u2297 B. This is a Hermitian bundle with flat, metric connection, implying that\n\u0393D (H \u2297 B) := {\u03c8 \u2208 \u0393(H \u2297 B) | (DH \u2297 1 + 1 \u2297 \u2207B )\u03c8 = 0}\n\n(5.1)\n\ndefines a Hilbert space, as the scalar product of two flat sections does not depend on the base point:\ndh\u03c8, \u03c6i = 0\n\n\u2200\u03c8, \u03c6 \u2208 \u0393D (H \u2297 B).\n\nThe observables remain unchanged, and act as f\u02c6 \u2297 1 on H \u2297 B, where 1 is the identity on B. Here\nit is important that the induced connection on End(H \u2297 B) is D \u2297 1 + 1 \u2297 d (because B is a rank\none bundle, and therefore its connection form is central in End(B)), so that f\u02c6 \u2297 1 is parallel, and\nleaves the space (5.1) invariant.\nHowever, the Hilbert space (5.1) is not the one from geometric quantization, given as a subset of\n\u0393P (\u2206P \u2297 B). Suppose there was a sesquilinear pairing\nh*, *i : \u0393P (\u2206P \u2297 B) \u00d7 \u0393D (H \u2297 B) \u2192 C.\nThen we could define the quantum operator \u03c3(f ) corresponding to f \u2208 C \u221e (M ) through h\u03c3(f )\u03c8, \u03c6i =\nh\u03c8, (f\u02c6\u2020 \u2297 1)\u03c6i. Indeed there is a canonical pairing, its construction is most conveniently described\nseparately for real and totally complex polarizations.\nReal polarizations\nsituation:\n\nWe need the following definition, which has no counterpart in the complex\n\nDefinition 5.1.

We can identify dn z with\nthe locally defined constant section c of \u2206P \u2282 H, whose value at any point is the constant wave\nfunction 1. Let \u03c0 be the orthogonal projection from H to \u2206P , then we define\nh*, *i : \u0393P (\u2206P \u2297 B) \u00d7 \u0393D (H \u2297 B) \u2192 \u0393P (\u2206P \u2297 B) \u00d7 \u0393(\u2206P \u2297 B) \u2192 C,\nZ\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u0001\n\u0001\nh\u03bc, \u03bdiB hc, \u03c8iH (det g)1/4 dn z \u2227 dn z,\ndn z \u2297 \u03bc, \u03c8 \u2297 \u03bd 7\u2192 dn z \u2297 \u03bc, \u03c0\u03c8 \u2297 \u03bd 7\u2192\n\n(5.5)\n\nM\n\n\u221a\n\u221a\nusing the pairing ( dn z, dn z) 7\u2192 (det g)1/4 dn z \u2227 dn z from geometric quantization.

This might impose a\nsevere restriction on the admissible pairs of connections and polarizations, but it is difficult to find\na more explicit formulation of this condition.\nDefinition 5.2. A representation \u03c3 of (C \u221e (M ), \u2217) on HP is defined through\nh\u03c3(f )\u03c8, \u03c6i = h\u03c8, (f\u02c6\u2020 \u2297 1)\u03c6i\n\n\u2200\u03c8 \u2208 HP , \u03c6 \u2208 \u0393D (H \u2297 B).\n\n(5.7)\n\nTo be precise, some regularity conditions on f will have to be imposed for the formula to make\nsense. In the flat case it would be enough to claim f \u2208 S \u2032 (R2n ) if one restricts the \u03c6s in (5.7) to\nsections of the Schwartz bundle S \u2282 H, with fibre S(Rn ) \u2282 L2 (Rn ).\nWe will see that on cotangent bundles our definition reproduces the geometric quantization operators. In this particular example one has a distinguished polarization, and it is possible to find a\nsymplectic connection satisfying the compatibility condition.\nFormally the non-degeneracy condition on the pairing implies equivalence of the two algebra representations, so that nothing seems to be gained by the transition to HP . One has to remember\nhowever that the representation on \u0393D (H \u2297 B) is in terms of infinite series in ~ and the local Weyl\noperators y \u03bc , whereas on HP one might hope to get an extension of geometric quantization by\nwell-defined operators.\n\n5.2\n\nCompatibility\n\nWe want to discuss the implications of compatibility of a real polarization with\na symplectic con\u0001\nnection, in the sense of definition 5.1. Choose sections \u03c8 \u2208 \u0393P (\u2206P )\u22121 \u2297 B and \u03c6 \u2208 \u0393D (H \u2297 B).\nFrom now on we denote DH simply by D as well, and write D \u2297 \u2207B := D \u2297 1 + 1 \u2297 \u2207B . Condition\n(5.2) takes the form (\u2200X \u2208 \u0393(P ))\n\u0001\n0 = X \u03c8, \u03c6 H\u2297B = (D \u2297 \u2207B ) X \u03c8, \u03c6 H\u2297B + \u03c8, (D \u2297 \u2207B ) X \u03c6 H\u2297B .\n\nThe last term vanishes, implying (D \u2297 \u2207B ) X \u03c8 = 0. In other words\n!\n\n\u0393P ;\u2207 (\u2206P )\u22121 \u2297 B) \u2282 \u0393P ;D\u2297\u2207B (H \u2297 B),\n\n17\n\n(5.8)\n\n\f\u0001\nwhere \u2207 is the partial connection. If \u03c8 = \u03b4 \u2297 \u03bc with \u03b4 \u2208 \u0393P ;\u2207 (\u2206P )\u22121 and \u03bc \u2208 \u0393P (B) this implies\nDX \u03b4 = 0 for X \u2208 \u0393(P ), and therefore\n\u0001\n\u0393P ;\u2207 (\u2206P )\u22121 \u2282 \u0393P ;D (H).\n(5.9)\nNote that the 'integrability condition'\n\n\u0001\nDX DY \u2212 DY DX \u2212 D[X,Y ] \u03c8 = \u03a9(X, Y )\u03c8 = 0\n\n\u2200X, Y \u2208 \u0393(P )\n\nfor \u03c8 \u2208 \u0393P ;D (H) is satisfied due to the Lagrangian property of P , otherwise \u0393P ;D (H)\n\u0001 would contain\nP\n\u22121\nonly the zero section. Of course, the same applies to \u0393P (B). If \u03b4 is in \u0393P ;\u2207 (\u2206 ) , then X(\u03b4) = 0\nfor X \u2208 \u0393(P ), and (5.9) demands A(X)\u03b4 = 0, where A is the connection form (3.26) of D = d + A.\nIn Darboux coordinates adapted to P our condition becomes:\n\u0011\n\u0010\n1\n1\nb a c\ny y \u2212 Rabck y a y b y c + . . . \u03b4 = 0,\n(5.10)\n\u03c9ka y a \u2212 \u03c9ab \u0393kc\n2\n8\nwhere k denotes an index in P , and the other ones are arbitrary. Due to the ~-grading all terms\nmust vanish separately, in particular we have \u03c9ka y a \u03b4 = 0, which is always satisfied due to y\u03b4 = 0\nfor y \u2208 P \u266d , cf. (4.10). In the next higher order we get a condition on the symplectic connection:\n\u0393kab y a y b \u03b4 = 0\n(recall that \u0393abc is fully symmetric in its indices). This amounts to saying that \u0393kla = 0, and\nimplies\n\u2207\u0393(P ) \u2282 \u0393(P \u2297 T \u2217 M ).\n(5.11)\nThe third order gives\nRabck y a y b y c \u03b4 = 0,\nimplying that R(abc)k vanishes if two or more of a, b, c are in P . Here (abc) denotes symmetrization\nin the indices. This condition however is automatically satisfied if the second order condition holds;\nthe latter implies the vanishing of Rabcd whenever three or more indices are in P , which can be\nseen from (3.1). We must leave it as an open question whether the higher order conditions really\nimpose further constraints on \u2207.\nA result of Bressler and Donin should be mentioned here [3]. They use a somewhat different\nformalism for deformation quantization, based on normal instead of Weyl ordering. Under the\nconditions\n\u2207\u0393(P ) \u2282 \u0393(P \u2297 T \u2217 M )\nand\nR(X, Y )Z = 0\n\n\u2200X, Y, Z \u2208 \u0393(P )\n\nthey show that the star product constructed from \u2207 satisfies the equation f \u2217g = f g for f \u2208 CP\u221e (M )\nand arbitrary g (which certainly does not hold for our star product; compare in the flat case). This\nstrong result suggests that the two conditions should suffice to guarantee compatibility of P and\n\u2207. They are both satisfied if the second order condition \u0393kla = 0 holds, and also for the K\u00e4hler\nconnection and holomorphic polarization, see below.\n\n18\n\n\f6\n6.1\n\nExamples\nThe flat case with real polarization: M = R2n .\n\nWe introduce linear coordinates (q i , pj ), i, j = 1, . . . , n, choose the constant symplectic form \u03c9 =\ndpj \u2227 dq j , the symplectic connection \u2207 = d, and a real polarization given by P = span{\u2202pj | j =\n1, . . . , n}.

Choose a constant section \u03bc 6= 0 of B.

Suppose one has chosen local coordinates q j on Q, then there is a set of canonical coordinates on M , given by (q j , pj ), where\npi (dq j ) = \u03b4i j . M carries a canonical symplectic form \u03c9 = dpj \u2227 dq j , as well as a canonical polarization, given by the vertical subbundle of T M , i.e. P(q,p) = span{\u2202p1 , . . . , \u2202pn } \u2282 T(q,p) T \u2217 Q. The\nprequantum bundle B can be chosen to be trivial, as its curvature \u03c9 = d(pj dq j ) is exact. It is\nnot so obvious how to choose the symplectic connection. As we assumed Q to be equipped with a\nmetric, we have the Levi-Civita connection \u2207LC on Q. Bordemann et.al. have shown that there is\na canonical lift of \u2207LC to M , which is symplectic and leads to a star product with nice properties\n[2]. In particular the product of two functions polynomial in p will be a finite polynomial in ~ and\np, so that ~ need not be considered as a formal element in the end, but can be given its physical\nvalue.\nWe will use the following notational convention. A latin index i runs from 1 to n and stands\nfor q i , whereas a barred latin index i denotes pi . Greek indices run from 1 to 2n, and include\nall coordinates. Generators of the local Weyl algebra Wm are denoted by y \u03bc (as in section 3),\nor by q\u0302 i and p\u0302i (not to be confused with the elements of \u0393D (W) corresponding to the functions\nq i , pi . We never use the symbols q\u0302 i , p\u0302i in this latter sense, although it would be consistent with\nf 7\u2192 f\u02c6 \u2208 \u0393D (W)). One forms are dx\u03bc , or dq i and dpi . The product y \u03bc y \u03bd still denotes the symmetric\ntensor product, whereas q\u0302 i p\u0302i is composition of operators, or the Weyl product.\nThe connection and curvature coefficients of the lifted connection on M are\n\ni\nRjkl\n\n\u0393kij = \u2212\u0393jik = \u2212\u0393ikj = \u0393\u0303kij ,\n\u0011\npa \u0010 a l\n\u0393kij =\n2\u0393\u0303jl \u0393\u0303ki \u2212 \u2202j \u0393\u0303aki + cycl.(ijk) ,\n3\n1 j\nj \u0001\nl\nl\nk\nl\n,\nRkij\nRkij = \u2212Rlij = R\u0303kij\n= R\u0303lki\n,\n+ R\u0303kli\n3\n\u0011\npa \u0010\na\nm\nm\nm\n\u2207i R\u0303jlk\n\u22123\u0393\u0303aim R\u0303jlk\n\u2212 \u0393\u0303alm R\u0303ijk\n=\n+ \u0393\u0303akm R\u0303ijl\n+ (i \u2194 j) ,\n3\n\n(6.5)\n\ni\ni\nwhere \u0393\u0303kij and R\u0303jkl\nare the Christoffel symbols and curvature tensor on Q, and \u0393kij , Rjkl\nthe lifted\n\u2217\nobjects on T Q. Components not listed vanish. Notice in particular that our first order condition\n\u0393klm = \u0393klm = 0 from (5.10) is satisfied. Now we want to show that the lifted connection \u2207 is\ncompatible with the vertical polarization in every order in ~. We need the following\n\nDefinition 6.1.

The Q-degree defines a (vector space)\nfiltration on \u0393(W \u2297 \u039bT \u2217 M ); we write q(\u03b7) > m if this holds for every homogeneous component of\n\u03b7 \u2208 \u0393(W \u2297 \u039bT \u2217 M ).\n20\n\n\fNote that the Q-degree is not additive in general: q(\u03b7 \u25e6 \u03c7) 6= q(\u03b7) + q(\u03c7), because of the relation\ndq i \u2227 dq i = 0. It is additive only when restricted to suitable sections:\nq(\u03b7 \u25e6 \u03c7) = q(\u03c7 \u25e6 \u03b7) = q(\u03b7) + q(\u03c7),\n\n\u2200\u03b7 \u2208 \u0393(W), \u03c7 \u2208 \u0393(W \u2297 \u039bT \u2217 M ).\n\n(6.7)\n\nLet us investigate the Q-degree of the connection form A of D, and the operator in \u0393D (W) corresponding to a function.

Now we make use of the iteration formula (3.14):\n\u0001\ni\nmod ~(n+2)/2\nr (n+1) = \u03b4\u22121 R\u0302 + \u03b4\u22121 \u2207r (n) + (r (n) )2\n~\n\nfor the higher order terms in r. Note that \u03b4\u22121 leaves the Q-degree invariant. We have \u2207 =\nd + [dU (\u0393), *], where d can only lower the Q-degree of the term proportional to Rijkl q\u0302 i q\u0302 j q\u0302 k dq l in\nr (3) , which remains > 2. The commutator \u2212 ~i \u0393\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 dx\u03b3 [y \u03b1 y \u03b2 , *] increases the Q-degree by 1 (unless\nthe result of its application vanishes), due again to q(dU (\u0393)) \u2265 1. In the higher order iteration\nsteps \u2207 can only decrease the Q-degree of terms containing either Rijkl or \u0393ijk (only unbarred\nindices!), as these are linear in p (cf. (6.5)). These however must arise from terms \u0393ijk q\u0302 i q\u0302 j dq k or\nagain the starting term Rijkl q\u0302 i q\u0302 j q\u0302 k dq l , which both have a two units higher Q-degree as we would\nexpect. Therefore we can infer that effectively every application of \u2207 increases the Q-degree by 1,\nwhere we have still ignored the (r (n) )2 -term in the iteration formula. It is obvious from the (almost)\nadditivity of the Q-degree that its inclusion does not change the picture. The same reasoning then\nworks for f\u02c6, using the iteration formula (3.18), and the fact that \u2207 can decrease the q-degree N\ntimes.\n\u0001\nProposition 6.3. In the situation of this paragraph we have \u0393P ;\u2207 (\u2206P )\u22121 \u2282 \u0393P ;D (H) (cf. 5.9),\nthus the pairing (5.3) is well defined.\nProof. As discussed above equation (5.10) we must show that A(q,p) (X)\u03b4 = 0 for every X \u2208 P(q,p) ,\nwhere \u03b4 is the delta distribution on Q(q,p) \u223c\n= Tq Q. This is the case iff every homogeneous term\nin Ak = A(\u2202pk ) contains more operators q\u0302 j than p\u0302j s, i.e. if q(Ak ) > 0. But we have q(Ak ) \u2265\nq(A) + 1 > 0 from the lemma above.\n21\n\n\fWe conclude that the symplectic connection (6.5) is compatible with the vertical polarization of\nT \u2217 Q, and (5.7) defines an operator \u03c3(f ) on the physical Hilbert space. Now we can compare our\nformalism to geometric quantization.\nProposition 6.4. If f is quantizable in geometric quantization, then \u03c3(f ) coincides with the geometric quantization operator.\nProof. Let f (q, p) = f (q) be a polarized function, and gj (q, p) = pj . From Lemma 6.2 we have\nq(f\u02c6 \u2212 f ) > 0,\n\n(2)\n\nq(\u011dj \u2212 \u011dj ) > 0.\n\n(6.8)\n\nIt immediately follows that (f\u02c6\u03c8)(0) = f \u03c8(0) for \u03c8 \u2208 \u0393(H). Recalling the explicit solution (3.19)\n\u0001\n1\n\u011d j = g j + \u2202\u03bc g j y \u03bc + \u2202\u03bc \u2202\u03bd \u2212 \u0393\u03ba\u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03ba g j y \u03bc y \u03bd + O(~3/2 )\n2\nto the iteration equation (3.18) for \u011dj , we obtain\n\u0001\n1\n(6.9)\n(\u011dj \u03c8)(0) = pj + p\u0302j \u2212 \u0393jab p\u0302b q\u0302 a \u03c8(0)\n2\nThis looks rather complicated yet, but will simplify in a moment. We want to apply the operators\nf\u02c6 \u2297 1, \u011dj \u2297 1 to elements of \u0393D (H \u2297 B). Suppose that \u03bc is a constant section of B. Then the\ncondition for \u03c8 \u2297 \u03bc to be in \u0393D (H \u2297 B) is (d + A \u2212 ~i \u03b8)\u03c8 = 0, where\n\u03b8 = pj dq j is the connection\n\u0001\nform on B. But we know from Lemma 6.2 that q A \u2212 ~i \u03c9ab y b dxa > 0, and q(r) > 1 (unless r\nvanishes). Therefore the condition evaluated in q\u0303 = 0 takes the simple form\ni\n(6.10)\n(d + A \u2212 \u03b8)(\u2202pj )\u03c8(0) = \u2202pj \u03c8(0) = 0\n~\n\u0010\n\u0011\ni\ni\ni\n(d + A \u2212 \u03b8)(\u2202qj )\u03c8(0) = \u2202qj \u2212 (pj + p\u0302j ) \u2212 \u0393jab p\u0302b q\u0302 a \u03c8(0) = 0.\n~\n~\n2~\nThe first equation tells us that \u03c8(0) does not depend on p, ensuring that the integral in our pairing\n(5.4) is well defined. Using \u0393jab = \u2212\u0393jab in Darboux coordinates, the second equation together with\n(6.9) gives\n~\n(\u011dj \u03c8)(0) = \u2202qj \u03c8(0).\n(6.11)\ni\nFrom the pairing h*, *i between \u0393P (\u2206P \u2297 B) and \u0393D (H \u2297 B)\nZ\np\nn\na(q)\u03c8q (0)dn q\n(6.12)\nha d q \u2297 \u03bc, \u03c8 \u2297 \u03bci =\nQ\n\n(if h\u03bc, \u03bciB \u2261 1) we then obtain the usual geometric quantization operators, i.e.\np\np\n\u0001\n\u03c3(f ) a dn q \u2297 \u03bc (q) = f (q)a(q) dn q \u2297 \u03bc,\n(6.13)\np\np\n\u0001\n~\n\u03c3(pj ) a dn q \u2297 \u03bc (q) = \u2202j a(q) dn q \u2297 \u03bc.\ni\n\u0001\nj\nWe still have to check that \u03c3 \u03b1 (q)pj gives the symmetrized product of \u03b1j (\u03c3(q)) and \u03c3(pj ).

Let f and g be polynomials of degree N and M in p respectively (with arbitrary\ndependence on q), and no ~-dependence. Then f \u2217 g is a polynomial of degree \u2264 N + M in ~.\n\u0001\nProof. Lemma 6.2 and the additivity of the Q-degree imply that q (f\u02c6 \u2212 f\u02c6(r) ) \u25e6 (\u011d \u2212 \u011d (s) ) >\n0 (\u03c7) = 0 if q(\u03c7) > 0 for \u03c7 \u2208 \u0393(W) (\u03c0 0 projects onto the part\nr + s \u2212 2(N + M ). But we have \u03c0\u2297\n\u2297\ncontaining no operators q\u0302, p\u0302, definition (3.8)). Therefore only terms f\u02c6(r) \u25e6 \u011d(s) with r+s \u2264 2(N +M )\ncontribute to f \u2217 g (defined in (3.21)), but these have ~-degree \u2264 2(N 2+M ) = N + M .\n\u2202\nIn fact a stronger result holds true [2]; define H = pj \u2202p\u2202 j + ~ \u2202~\n, then\n\nH(f \u2217 g) = (Hf ) \u2217 g + f \u2217 (Hg),\na property called homogeneity in [2]. Recall the expansion in ~ of the star product\nf \u2217 g = fg +\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n~k ck (f, g).\n\nk=1\n\nWe have shown that the series is indeed finite if f and g are polynomials in p. A monomial h of\ndegree N in p can be split as h = hj pj , where hj is a monomial of degree N \u22121. As our quantization\nmap \u03c3 is a homomorphism w.r.t. the star product, we obtain\nj\n\n\u03c3(h) = \u03c3(h )\u03c3(pj ) \u2212\n\nN\nX\nk=1\n\n\u0001\n~k \u03c3 ck (hj , pj ) ,\n\n(6.14)\n\nenabling us to determine \u03c3(h) recursively, because all the functions on the r.h.s. are polynomials\nof degree at most N \u2212 1, and we know the operators corresponding to affine-linear functions. The\ncalculations involved become very complex however, already for polynomials of degree 2! In this\ncase the formula (for two affine-linear functions) reads\n\u03c3(f g) = \u03c3(f )\u03c3(g) \u2212\n\n\u0001 ~2\n\u0001\ni~\n\u03c3 {f, g} \u2212 \u03c3 (\u2207\u03bc Xf )\u03bd (\u2207\u03bd Xg )\u03bc .\n2\n4\n\n(6.15)\n\nIn [15] the operator corresponding to the kinetic energy term g ab (q)pa pb has been determined this\nway, the result being\n\u0002\n\u0001\n\u0001 \u0003 \u221a\n\u221a \u0001\n(6.16)\n\u03c3 g ab pa pb \u03c8 \u2297 \u03bc = \u2212~2 \u2206 \u2212 R\u03034 \u03c8 \u2297 \u03bc,\np\nn\n\u2206 is the Laplace-Beltrami operator, and R\u0303 the\nfor \u03c8 \u2208 \u0393P (B) = C \u221e (Q), \u03bc = |det\np g|d q, where\nscalar curvature of Q. The section |det g|dn q instead of dn q has been chosen to make the result\nindependent of coordinates, so that Riemannian normal coordinates can be used, which simplify\nthe calculation.\nComparison \u221aA different quantization scheme for cotangent bundles exists, where the space of\nstates is L2 (Q, det gdn q) [12]. It starts from the observation, that in the flat case the Schr\u00f6dinger\nquantization map can be written as\nZ\n\u0001\ni\n1\n\u02c6\ne ~ p(x\u2212q) f x+q\n, p \u03c8(q)dn qdn p\nf \u03c8(x) =\n2\nn\n(2\u03c0~) R2n\n\n23\n\n\ffor f \u2208 S \u2032 (R2n ), \u03c8 \u2208 S(Rn ). In order to generalize this formula to the curved case, we rewrite it in\nterms of the exponential function in the sense of differential geometry. Recall that in the flat case\nwe have Tx\u2217 Rn \u223c\n= Rn and\n= Tx Rn \u223c\nexpx : Tx Rn \u2192 Rn , v 7\u2192 x + v,\nimplying\nmidpoint\n\nx\u2212q\n2\nx+q\n2\n\nn\n= exp\u22121\nx+q (x).

The kinetic energy operator however is different from the one\nwe obtained (6.16).\nIt appears to us as a drawback of the above quantization scheme that the metaplectic group, which\nis the symmetry group of quantum mechanics on a symplectic vector space, does not seem to play\nany role there. But there is no criterion to decide which quantization is the physical one.\n\n6.4\n\nA remark on K\u00e4hler manifolds\n\nOn a K\u00e4hler manifold one has the holomorphic polarization, and also a canonical symplectic connection, the Levi-Civita connection of the K\u00e4hler metric g. Its nonvanishing components are [9]\n\u0393abc = \u2212i\u2202a \u2202b \u2202c K,\n\n\u0393abc = i\u2202a \u2202b \u2202c K.\n\nWe are interested in the operators corresponding to holomorphic functions, as well as the function\n\u2202\n\u2202z a K, in order to compare to the geometric quantization operators (4.9). In the case of cotangent\nbundles we made use of the fact that the covariant derivative D on H contained only finitely many\nterms contributing to D\u03c8(0), which made it possible to determine the operator corresponding to\npa in the proof of proposition 6.4.\nThere seems to be no analogous property of D when constructed from a K\u00e4hler connection, and\nthe method from above cannot be applied here. We take a look at the first terms appearing in the\n24\n\n\fcorresponding expressions nevertheless. Let \u03bc \u2208 \u0393(B) be constant (locally, in a trivialization with\n\u03b8 = \u2212i\u2202K), then \u03c8 \u2297 \u03bc is in \u0393D (H \u2297 B) iff (D \u2212 ~i \u03b8)\u03c8 = 0. We calculate\ni\nh \u2202\n1\n1\n1\ni \u0001\nb\nc b\n1/2\nK\nK\n\u1e91\n\u2212\n\u1e91\n\u1e91\n+\nO(~\n)\n\u03c8(0),\n\u2212\n\u2202\nK\n\u2212\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\nD \u2212 \u03b8 \u2202 \u03c8(0) =\na\na b\na b c\n~ \u2202za\n\u2202z a ~\n~\n4~\ni\nh \u2202\ni \u0001\n1\nc b\n1/2\n\u2202\n\u2202\nK\nD \u2212 \u03b8 \u2202 \u03c8(0) =\n\u1e91\n\u1e91\n+\nO(~\n)\n\u03c8(0).\n(6.19)\n+\n\u2202\na\nc\nb\n~ \u2202za\n\u2202z a 4~\n\nIn the real case the second equation was (D \u2212 ~i \u03b8) \u2202 \u03c8(0) =\n\u2202p\n\n\u2202\n\u2202p \u03c8(0)\n\n= 0, and told us that \u03c8(0) was\n\nindependent of p. One would expect to find \u03c8(0) being holomorphic here, instead we have\n\u2202\ni\n\u03c8(0) = \u2212 \u0393cca \u03c8(0) + O(~1/2 ).\na\n\u2202z\n4\n\nFurther, the two equations (6.19) do not seem to imply any simplifications on the operators f\u02c6\u2020 = f\u02c6\n\u2020\nd\nand \u2202d\na K = \u2202a K, for holomorphic f , which are needed to determine \u03c3(f ) and \u03c3(\u2202a K).\n\nThere is still an obvious necessary condition for the results \u03c3(f ) = f and \u03c3(\u2202a K) = ~ \u2202z\u2202 a , as well\nas symmetrized operators for products f \u2202a K. For the star product these would imply the relations\nf \u2217 g = f g for holomorphic f, g, and\nf \u2217 \u2202a K = f \u2202a K +\n\ni~\n{f, \u2202a K},\n2\n\n(6.20)\n\nwhich can be checked in pure deformation quantization. There is no obvious way however to\ncalculate the star products exactly. A term by term calculation up to O(~4 ) suggests that they\nmight indeed hold [15].\nOne should also keep in mind that it is not strictly necessary to work with the K\u00e4hler connection\nhere, in principle any symplectic connection is possible. But the condition (6.20) will certainly\nnot be satisfied for arbitrary connections, it is indeed very restrictive and might even single out\nthe K\u00e4hler connection. It is also questionable whether the pairing we constructed is always nondegenerate.\nAfter all there is not much we can say about K\u00e4hler manifolds, except in the trivial case M = Cn .\nThis might be an indication that the presented formalism needs some modification in general.\n\n7\n\nConclusion\n\nWe have shown that it is possible to define a representation of the deformation quantization algebra on the Hilbert space of geometric quantization, if some conditions are satisfied. For real\npolarizations one has to find a compatible connection (definition 5.1), and in general the pairing of\nthe different Hilbert spaces should induce an isomorphism between them.\nThe difficulties in geometric quantization to define operators of higher order in p or z can be\nexplained in this formalism by the fact that they depend on the chosen connection, and are therefore\nnot uniquely determined by the geometric quantization data (\u03c9, P, B, H).\nAn open problem is the determination of the quantum operators on a K\u00e4hler manifold. If\nthis can be solved, the resulting theory should be compared to existing quantization schemes on\nK\u00e4hler manifolds, like Berezin, Berezin-Toeplitz (these are generalizations of normal and antinormal\nordered quantization, and we do not expect our quantization to coincide with either of them)\nand of course geometric quantization. See [1] and references therein for an overview of different\nquantization schemes.\n25\n\n\fWhen should we consider two quantizations (A1 , H1 ) and (A2 , H2 ) of (M, \u03c9) as equivalent? Of\ncourse, they must give the same expectation values for the observables. Suppose there is an algebra\nisomorphism \u03b1 : A1 \u2192 A2 and a unitary map U : H1 \u2192 H2 such that \u03b1(f ) = U f U \u22121 . Then the\ntwo quantizations are equivalent if we are willing to identify \u03c8 \u2208 H1 with U \u03c8 \u2208 H2 and f \u2208 A1\nwith \u03b1(f ) \u2208 A2 , because\nh\u03c8, f \u03c8i1 = hU \u03c8, \u03b1(f )U \u03c8i2 .\n(7.1)\nThis is an appropriate mathematical notion of equivalence, physically however the elements of the\nalgebra are fixed observables (recall that as sets our algebras are contained in C \u221e (M )), and we\ncannot identify f with the different observable \u03b1(f ).\nIf an algebra is compatible with two different polarizations, we still want to identify the two\nsystems, so if the corresponding representations are \u03c3i : A \u2192End(Hi ), i = 1, 2, and U : H1 \u2192 H2\nis a unitary map satisfying\n\u03c32 (f ) = U \u22121 \u03c31 (f )U\n(7.2)\nthen we consider (A, H1 ) and (A, H2 ) as equivalent, and identify \u03c8 \u2208 H1 with U \u03c8 \u2208 H2 . Note that\n\u03c3i are really the particular representations constructed above, and determine U uniquely up to a\nphase.\nAnother way to see that not all quantizations satisfying (7.1) are equivalent, is to consider a\nfixed polarization with two different algebras. We know that |\u03c8|2 is supposed to have a physical\nmeaning as a probability density on Q = M/D, and unless U \u2208 U (1) we cannot identify \u03c8 with\nU \u03c8, because they define different densities. Therefore we must consider any two quantum systems\nconstructed from different symplectic connections as physically inequivalent.\nWhat is then the moduli space of inequivalent quantizations of (M, \u03c9)? Assuming that we can\nalways find a unitary intertwiner U satisfying (7.2), the polarization is determined by the connection\nup to equivalence (however, there are symplectic manifolds not admitting any polarization at all,\nwhich are therefore not quantizable [7]). There is then still a dependence on the prequantum bundle\nB, the metaplectic structure H, and the symplectic connection \u2207. In the example of cotangent\nbundles we have seen that different symplectic connections correspond to physically inequivalent\nclassical systems. The same is true for the prequantum bundle B, but the interpretation of the\nmetaplectic structure is not obvious. Neither do we understand the meaning of the symplectic\nconnection in general. It is also very questionable whether one can always find a unitary intertwiner\nU as in (7.2) for different polarizations compatible with a given connection, because the set of\ncompatible polarizations contains at least all totally complex polarizations. A possible way out\nmight be to impose a compatibility condition on these as well, like the one obtained by Bressler\nand Donin [3], see our discussion at the end of section 5.2, or to require holomorphic functions\nto be quantized to multiplication operators. Further one needs the pairing between the different\nHilbert spaces to be non-degenerate, which might also restrict the admissible polarizations. The\nconstruction of U is discussed in [21].\n\nAcknowledgement\nI would like to thank my former advisor G. Grensing for many discussions on the subject.\n\nReferences\n[1] Ali, S.
