However, there exist no known\nresults on quantifying the performance gains from deploying\nmany BSs. To address this issue, we adopt a stochastic-geometry\nmodel of the downlink cellular network and analyze the mobile\noutage probability. Specifically, given Poisson distributed BSs,\nthe outage probability is shown to diminish inversely with the increasing ratio between the BS and mobile densities. Furthermore,\nwe analyze the optimal tradeoff between the performance gain\nfrom increasing the BS density and the resultant network cost\naccounting for energy consumption, BS hardware and backhaul\ncables. The optimal BS density is proved to be proportional to the\nsquare root of the mobile density and the inverse of the square\nroot of the cost factors considered.\n\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nCompared with the advancement in physical-layer techniques, reducing the cell size by using more base stations\n(BSs) have resulted in much more significant throughput gains.\nThis observation has led to active research on the deployment\nadditional BSs to shorten the transmission distances [1]. In\nview of prior work, it remains unclear what is the network\nperformance in the limit of many BSs, which is addressed in\nthis letter.\nThe difficulty of quantifying the asymptotic network performance lies in the lack of a practical and yet tractable cellularnetwork model. Traditionally, cellular networks are modeled\nusing the grid model and the evaluation of their performance\nhas to rely on simulation (see e.g., [2]). Recently, a tractable\nstochastic-geometry model for a downlink cellular network has\nbeen proposed in [3], where BSs are modeled as a homogeneous Poisson point process (PPP) which allows the derivation\nof the mobile outage probability in a relatively simple form.\nA key observation in [3] is that the outage probability is\ninsensitive to the change on the BS density assuming all BSs\ntransmit. This assumption does not hold for the scenario where\nBSs significantly outnumber mobiles and consequently many\ncells are empty. This scenario exists in heterogeneous networks\nwhere dense microcell and femtocell BSs are installed [1] or\ncellular networks where a large number of distributed antennas\nare deployed in each cell and each antenna functions as a\nvirtual BS [4]. In this letter, the network model in [3] is\nmodified by preventing BSs in empty cells from transmitting.\nIn the limit of many BSs, the active-BS density converges to\nthe mobile density while the transmission distances diminish.\nAs a result, increasing the BS density can increase the received\nS.

Updated on November 1, 2018\n\nsignal power without causing additional inter-cell interference.\nThe resultant network performance gain is quantified in this\nletter. Specifically, given fixed mobile density, it is shown that\nthe outage probability diminishes inversely with increasing BS\ndensity. It is verified by simulation that this result derived\nfor asymptotically many BSs is accurate even in the practical\nrange of BS density.\nDespite improvements on the network coverage, the deployment of many BSs increases the network cost including the\nlength of backhaul cables connecting BSs to switching centers\n[5], the BS hardware and the network energy consumption.\nIn this letter, the BS density is optimized for achieving an\noptimal tradeoff between network performance and cost. To\nthis end, the network model is augmented with an additional\nhomogeneous PPP modeling switching centers. The optimal\nBS density is derived by minimizing a multi-objective cost\nfunction that accounts for the BS hardware, total cable length,\ntotal energy consumption and the outage probability. It is\nshown that the optimal BS density is proportional to the square\nroot of the mobile density and inversely proportional to the\nsquare root of a linear combination of the network cost factors.\nII. N ETWORK M ODEL\nBSs, mobiles and switching centers are modeled as independent PPPs \u03a3b , \u03a3u and \u03a3s of density \u03bbb , \u03bbu and \u03bbs ,\nrespectively. Mobiles are assigned to the nearest BSs and\nBSs are connected to the nearest switching centers by cable,\nresulting in the network architecture in Fig. 1. In each time\nslot, a BS in an empty cell is silent and a BS in a nonempty cell\ntransmits to a single mobile selected from mobiles in the same\ncell with equal probability, which is called a typical active\nmobile. We assume that all BSs use the same transmission\npower \u03bc. Then the signal transmitted by a BS Y is received at\nthe intended mobile with the power SY = \u03bchY DY\u2212\u03b1 where\n{hY } are i.i.d. exp(1) random variable modeling Rayleigh\nfading, DY is the transmission distance, and \u03b1 is the pathloss exponent. By adopting a typical model (see e.g., [6]), the\npower Pb consumed by a BS is given as Pb = A\u03bc + B where\nA is a constant and B is the offset power consumed regardless\nof if the BS is transmitting.\nIn this letter, we consider outage probability for a typical\nactive mobile as a network performance metric. Let U \u22c6 and Y \u22c6\ndenote a typical active mobile and the corresponding serving\nBS, respectively. Assuming an interference-limited network,\ncorrect decoding at each mobile requires that the received\nsignal-to-interference ratio (SIR) is above a given threshold \u03b8.\nThen outage probability Pout for U \u22c6 is Pout = Pr(SIR < \u03b8).\n\n\f2\n\nLee and Huang: Coverage and Economy of Cellular Networks with Many Base Stations\n\nB. Mobile Outage Probability\nIn terms of p, Pout for a typical active mobile U \u22c6 can be\nobtained as shown in the following proposition.\nProposition 1. Given that the transmitting BSs are approximated by \u03a6\u0303b , the outage probability Pout for a typical active\nmobile U \u22c6 is\n\u03bbu\n\u03bbb /\u03bbu \u2192 \u221e\n(5)\nPout \u2248 \u03b2 ,\n\u03bbb\n2 R\u221e\nwhere \u03b2 = \u03b8 \u03b1 \u03b8\u2212 \u03b12 1 \u03b12 dx.\n1+x\n\nProof: The interference power I for U \u22c6 is\nX\n\u03bchY |U \u22c6 \u2212 Y |\u2212\u03b1\nI=\nY \u2208\u03a6\u0303b \\{Y\n\n(6)\n\n\u22c6}\n\nFig. 1.

Moreover, define\nthe transmission distance D\u22c6 = |U \u22c6 \u2212 Y \u22c6 | and D\u22c6 has the\nfollowing distribution function [3], [8]\n\nNote that since the BSs and mobiles are distributed as PPPs,\nthe outage probability for a typical active mobile is independent with the number of other mobiles in the same cell.\n\nfD\u22c6 (r) = 2\u03c0\u03bbb re\u2212\u03c0\u03bbb r .\n\n2\n\nIII. M OBILE P ERFORMANCE\nA. Approximation of the Transmitting BS Process\nEven though the BSs are distributed as a PPP, the process\nof transmitting BSs is not because the empty-cell probability\nfor each BS depends on the cell area that is determined\nby BSs' relative locations. For tractability, the transmitting\nBSs are modeled as a homogeneous PPP derived by thinning\nthe BS process \u03a3b as follows. Let p represent the emptycell probability, namely the probability that the typical BS\nis assigned no mobile. Mathematically,\np = Pr (|Y \u22c6 \u2212 U | > |Y \u2212 U | \u2200 Y \u2208 \u03a3b \\{Y \u22c6 }, U \u2208 \u03a3u ) .\nWe can obtain p using the following result from [7] that\napproximates the distribution function of S, the area of a\ntypical Voronoi cell in a Poisson random tessellation\nfS (x) \u2248\n\n3.53.5 3.5 2.5 \u22123.5\u03bbb x\n\u03bb x e\n.\n\u0393(3.5) b\n\n(1)\n\nSpecifically, using (1) and the fact that p is the average void\nprobability of the mobile process for a typical Voronoi cell,\nZ \u221e\ne\u2212\u03bbu x fS (x)dx\n(2)\np=\n0\n\u0012\n\u0013\u22123.5\n\u03bbu\n\u2248 1+\n(3)\n3.5\u03bbb\n\u03bbu\n,\n\u03bbb /\u03bbu \u2192 \u221e.\n(4)\n\u22481\u2212\n\u03bbb\nIt can be observed from (4) that p increases with the growing\nratio \u03bbb /\u03bbu . Intuitively, by increasing the BS density with\nthe mobile density fixed, cells shrink and as a result the\nempty-cell probability grows. Given p, the transmitting BSs\ncan be approximated as a PPP \u03a6\u0303b with the density (1 \u2212 p)\u03bbb .\nThe results derived based on this approximation is shown by\nsimulation to be accurate as \u03bbb /\u03bbu \u2192 \u221e.\n\n(7)\n\nUsing (6), (7) and the same procedure as [3, (15)] with some\nminor modifications,\n1\nPout = 1 \u2212\n.\n(8)\n1 + (1 \u2212 p)\u03b2\nFor \u03bbb /\u03bbu \u2192 \u221e, Pout can be approximated using (4) as\n1\n,\n\u03bbb /\u03bbu \u2192 \u221e\n1 + \u03b2 \u03bb\u03bbub\n\u0012 \u00132 !\n\u03bbu\n\u03bbu\n=\u03b2\n.\n+O\n\u03bbb\n\u03bbb\n\nPout \u2248 1 \u2212\n\n(9)\n(10)\n\nThe desired result follows from (10).\nDespite the similarity in proof, the result in Proposition 1\nfocuses on the regime of many BSs while that in [3, (15)]\nassumes that mobiles significantly outnumber BSs. Consequently, the outage probability derived in [3] is insensitive to\nthe variation on the BS density \u03bbb but Pout in (5) decreases approximately linearly with increasing \u03bbb . This relation between\nPout and \u03bbb rises from two factors. First, with \u03bbu fixed, the\ndensity of transmitting BSs and hence the interference power\nmeasured at mobiles remain constant even as \u03bbb increasing.\nSecond, the received signal power at an active mobile increases\nas \u03bbb /\u03bbu \u2192 \u221e due to the reduced transmitting distance.\nIV. O PTIMIZATION\n\nOF\n\nT HE BASE -S TATION D ENSITY\n\nIn this section, we analyze the optimal tradeoff between the\nperformance gain by employing many BSs and the resultant\nincreased network cost in terms of BS energy consumption\nand installation, and backhaul cable length.\nThe BS density \u03bbb can be optimized by minimizing the\nfollowing multi-objective function C(\u03bbb ):\nC(\u03bbb ) = c1 L + c2 \u03bbb + c3 P\u03a3 + \u03c6Pout\n\n(11)\n\nwhere c1 , c2 , c3 denote the cost of laying a cable of a unit\nlength, the hardware cost of an individual BS, and the price of\nconsuming one-unit power, and \u03c6 represents the penalty for\n\n\f3\n\nLee and Huang: Coverage and Economy of Cellular Networks with Many Base Stations\n\n1.8\n\n1.4\n\nSimulation: BS thinning\nSimulation: All BSs are transmitting\nApproximation\n\n1.6\n\nExact\nApproximation\n1.2\n\n1.4\n1\n\nOptimized BS density\n\nOutage probability\n\n1.2\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.4\n0.2\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\nBS density\n\nan event that a mobile is in outage.

By substituting (5) and (13) into\n(11) and minimizing the resultant cost function, the optimal\nBS density \u03bb\u2217b is obtained as\ns\n\u03c6\n\u2217\n\u03bbb =\n\u03b2\u03bbu .\n(14)\nc1\n+\nc2 + c3 B\n3/2\n2\u03bbs\n\nIt can be observed that \u03bb\u2217b is an increasing function of \u03c6 and\n\u03bbu . This suggests that it is desirable to install more BSs given\nmore serve penalty for outage events or a larger number of\nmobiles. Combining the definition of \u03b2 in Proposition 1 and\n(14), it can be inferred that the optimal BS density should\ngrow with the increasing target SIR \u03b8. Moreover, \u03bb\u2217b grows as\n\u03bbs increases since the cable cost for installing an additional\nBS is reduced. In addition, \u03bb\u2217b is\u0010also larger for lower\n\u0011 averc1\nage aggregate prices for one BS\n3/2 + c2 + c3 B , which\n2\u03bbs\nagrees with intuition.\nV. S IMULATION\nIn this section, the derived Pout and optimal BS density\n\u03bb\u2217b are validated using simulation. In the simulation, the BSs\nare modeled as a homogeneous PPP in R2 . The simulation\nparameters are set as \u03b8 = 3 dB, \u03b1 = 3, and \u03bbu = 0.02.\nFig. 2 compares the outage probability computed using (5)\nand its simulated values. They can be observed to converge as\n\u03bbb increases. Also plotted in Fig. 2 is the outage probability\ngiven that all BSs transmit, which is insensitive to the changes\non \u03bbb as also observed in [3].\n\nFig. 3.\nComparison between the optimal BS density (\u03bb\u2217b ) based on\napproximated Pout and exact value obtained numerically for increasing K\nwith fixed \u03bbu = 0.02.\n\nThe accuracy of \u03bb\u2217b is verified in Fig. 3. Using the factors\nin (14), let us define a parameter\n\u03c6\nK = c1\n(15)\n+\nc2 + c3 B\n3/2\n2\u03bbs\n\nwhich represents the ratio of the penalty for outage to average\naggregate cost for an one BS. Fig. 3 compares \u03bb\u2217b and the\noptimal density obtained numerically by varying K. It can\nbe observed that by increasing K, \u03bb\u2217b traces the exact value\nwithin a constant and small gap (\u2248 0.07). With the gap\nunchanged, this result reveals that the percentage of error for\nthe derived density reduces with increasing K. The error is\nshown to be lower than 10% with K > 10. It means that \u03bb\u2217b\nis accurate when the penalty for outage is larger than the price\nfor operating each BS.\nVI. C ONCLUSION\nIn this letter, we have quantified the performance gains by\nemploying many BSs in cellular networks. Specifically, it has\nbeen shown that the outage probability decreases inversely\nwith the increasing BS density. Moreover, the BS density has\nbeen optimized by considering both performance gains and\nnetwork cost including BS hardware, energy consumption and\nbackhaul cables. The optimal BS density has been shown to\nincrease sub-linearly with the growing mobile density given\nthe performance metric of outage probability. Moreover, larger\nBS density is desirable for lower prices for power, cables and\nBS hardware.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nThe authors thank Seung Min Yu for helpful discussions.\nR EFERENCES\n[1] A.
