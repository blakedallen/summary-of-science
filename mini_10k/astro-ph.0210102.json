Introduction\nPolarization has proven to be an important tool in AGN research. In\nprinciple, linear and particularly circular polarization observations of\nsynchrotron radiation may permit measurements of various properties of relativistic jets such as: magnetic field strength and topology,\nthe net magnetic flux carried by jets (and hence generated in the\ncentral engine), the energy spectrum of radiating particles, and the\njet composition (i.e., whether jets are mainly composed of e+ \u2212 e\u2212\npairs or electron-proton plasma). The renewed interest in polarization of compact radio sources stems from two recent developments.\nFirst, Bower et al. (1999) detected circular polarization using the Very\nLarge Array (VLA) in the best supermassive black hole candidate,\nthe Galactic Center (Sgr A\u2217 ). This discovery was quickly confirmed\nby Sault and Macquart (1999) using the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). Circular polarization was also detected in the\ncelebrated X-ray binary system SS 433 (Fender et al., 2000) and the\nmicroquasar GRS 1915 +105 (Fender et al., 2002). Moreover, the Very\n\u2217\n\nInvited talk\nc 2018 Kluwer Academic Publishers. Printed in the Netherlands.\n\ncpmr.tex; 24/12/2018; 23:27; p.1\n\n\f2\n\nMateusz Ruszkowski\n\nLong Baseline Array (VLBA) has now detected circular polarization in\nas many as 20 AGN (Wardle et al., 1998; Homan and Wardle, 1999).\nSecond, it is now possible to measure circular polarization with an\nunprecedented accuracy of 0.01% using the ATCA (Rayner et al., 2000).\nThis dramatic improvement in the observational status of polarization\nmeasurements has also brought new questions. For example, there is\nobservational evidence that the sign of circular polarization is persistent\nover decades in some sources (Komesaroff et al., 1984; Homan and\nWardle, 1999; Hughes, 2002), which indicates that it is a fundamental\nproperty of jets and strongly suggests that a small magnetic flux is\nfrozen into jets. Another problem, is how to reconcile the high level of\ncircular polarization with the lower value of linear polarization in Sgr\nA\u2217 (Bower et al., 1999) and M81\u2217 (Brunthaler et al., 2001; Bower, Falcke and Mellon, 2002). Moreover, there is not even a general consensus\non the mechanism responsible for the circular polarization properties\nof jets (Wardle et al., 1998).\n\n2. Observational trends\nCompact radio sources typically show a linear polarization (LP) of a\nfew percent of the total intensity (Jones et al., 1985). This is much\nless than the theoretical maximum for synchrotron sources, which can\napproach 70% in homogeneous sources with unidirectional magnetic\nfield. Therefore, magnetic fields in radio sources are believed to be\nhighly inhomogeneous, although the nonvanishing linear polarization\nis in itself an indirect indication of a certain degree of ordering of the\nfield. From the theoretical point of view, ordered jet magnetic field\nis expected when shocks compress an initially random field (Laing,\n1980; Laing, 1981; Hughes et al., 1989) or when such initial fields are\nsheared along the jet (Laing, 1980; Laing, 1981; Begelman, Blandford\nand Rees, 1984).\nCircular polarization (CP) is a common feature of quasars and blazars\n(Rayner et al., 2000; Homan et al., 2001). It is usually characterized by\nan approximately flat spectrum, and is generated near synchrotron selfabsorbed jet cores (Homan and Wardle, 1999). CP is detected in about\n30%-50% of these objects. Measured degrees of CP are generally lower\nthan the levels of LP and usually range between 0.1% and 0.5% (Homan\nand Wardle, 1999; Homan et al., 2001). Observations of proper motion\nof CP-producing regions in the quasar 3C 273 (Homan and Wardle,\n1999) suggest that circular polarization is intrinsic to the source, as\nopposed to being due to foreground effects.\n\ncpmr.tex; 24/12/2018; 23:27; p.2\n\n\fLinear and Circular Polarization Properties of Jets\n\n3\n\n3. Mechanisms for producing circular polarization\nThe most obvious candidate for generating circular polarization in\ncompact radio sources is intrinsic emission (Legg and Westfold, 1968).\nHowever, intrinsic CP will be strongly suppressed by the tangled magnetic field and possibly by e+ \u2212 e\u2212 pairs, which do not contribute CP.\nOther mechanisms have also been proposed, among which the most\npopular ones are scintillation (Macquart and Melrose, 2000), general\nrelativistic effects in dispersive plasma (Broderick and Blandford, 2002)\nand Faraday conversion (Jones and O'Dell, 1977a; Jones, 1988; Wardle\net al., 1998; Ruszkowski and Begelman, 2002; Beckert and Falcke, 2002).\nThe scintillation mechanism, in which circular polarization is stochastically produced by a birefringent screen located between the jet and\nthe observer, fails to explain the persistent sign of circular polarization\n(if required by observations in a given source) as the time-averaged CP\nsignal is predicted to vanish. The second mechanism can be important\nclose to the central black hole. The last mechanism - Faraday conversion - is a very promising one and in the next subsection I discuss it\nin more detail.\n3.1. Faraday rotation and conversion\nThe polarization of radiation changes as it propagates through any\nmedium in which modes are characterized by different plasma speeds.\nIn the case of plasma dominated by cold electrons the modes are nearly\ncircularly polarized. The left and right circular modes have different\nphase velocities and therefore the linear polarization vector of the\npropagating radiation rotates. This effect \u2013 Faraday rotation \u2013 is a\nspecific example of a more general phenomenon called birefringence.\nIn a medium whose natural modes are linearly or elliptically polarized, such as a plasma of relativistic particles, birefringence leads to\nthe partial cyclic conversion between linearly and circularly polarized\nradiation as the phase relationships between the modes along the ray\nchange with position.\n3.1.1. Strong rotativity\nStrong departures from mode circularity occur only when radiation\npropagates within a small angle \u223c \u03bdL /\u03bd of the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field, where \u03bdL = eB/2\u03c0me c (quasi-transverse\nlimit, QT). Therefore radiative transfer is often performed in the quasilongitudinal (QL) approximation. In a typical observational situation\nit is usually assumed that Faraday rotation within the source cannot\nbe too large, as this will lead to the suppression of linear polarization.\n\ncpmr.tex; 24/12/2018; 23:27; p.3\n\n\f4\n\nMateusz Ruszkowski\n\nB\n\nB\n\nBu\n\nBH\nr\n\u03c4\n\nFigure 1. Jet and its magnetic field (left panel) and geometry of the assumed\nmagnetic field assumed in the calculations (right panel).\n\nHowever, this constraint does not prevent rotativity from achieving\nlarge values locally as long as the mean rotativity, i.e., averaged over\nall directions of magnetic field along the line of sight, is indeed relatively\nsmall. Such a situation may happen in a turbulent plasma. Technically,\nthe strong rotativity regime (\u03b6v\u22172 \u226b \u03b6q\u22172 , see below) is equivalent to the\nQL limit (Jones and O'Dell, 1977b) and in this proceedings I mostly\nfocus on this approximation.\n\n4. Model for polarization\nI consider a highly tangled magnetic field with a very small mean\ncomponent which is required to determine the sign of circular polarization. From a theoretical view-point, we would expect some net\npoloidal magnetic field, either originating from the central black hole\nor from the accretion disk, to be aligned preferentially along the jet axis.\nSpecifically, from equipartition and flux freezing arguments applied to\n2 i1/2 \u223c\na conical jet (Blandford and K\u00f6nigl, 1979) we get hBk2 i1/2 \u223c hB\u22a5\nBrms \u221d r \u22121 where r is the distance along the synchrotron emitting\nsource and the symbols k and \u22a5 refer to magnetic fields parallel and\nperpendicular to the jet axis, respectively. From the flux-freezing argument applied to the small parallel bias in the magnetic field we obtain\nhB\u22a5 i \u223c 0 and hBk i \u221d r \u22122 \u221d \u03b4Brms , where \u03b4 \u2261 Bu /Brms \u226a 1 is the\nratio of the uniform and fluctuating components of the magnetic field\n(see Figure 1).\n4.1.

In a\nrealistic situation, magnetic field will not be uniform. From the analytic\nview-point, polarization can be calculated by averaging equation of radiative transfer over many orientations of magnetic field.

In the later case, projected orientation of the polarization is\nmore chaotic and the source is depolarized.\n4.2. Fiducial model\nI assume that the typical mean Lorentz factor of radiating electrons\n\u03b3 \u223c 102 and that the electron energy distribution function has a powerlaw form n \u221d \u03b3 \u2212(2\u03b1+1) , where \u03b1 is the spectral index of optically thin\nsynchrotron emission. I use \u03b1 = 0.5 and assume that the electron\ndistribution is cut-off below \u03b3i \u223c a few. For example, for the maximum\nbrightness temperature Tb \u223c 1011 K (Readhead, 1994) we have \u03b3 \u223c\n3kTb /me c2 \u223c 50, which corresponds to mean rotation and conversion\nper unit synchrotron optical depth of order \u223c \u03b4\u03b6v\u2217 \u223c 3 \u00d7 103 \u03b4 ln \u03b3i /\u03b3i3\nand \u03b6q\u2217 \u223c \u2212 ln(\u03b3/\u03b3i ), respectively, for \u03bd \u223c \u03b3 2 eB/2\u03c0me c. Results from\nthe simulations are shown in Figure 4.\nNote that, even though the rotation per unit depth is very large\nand the magnetic field points (almost) randomly away and towards\nthe observer, the source is not totally depolarized. Note also that,\ncircular polarization peaks around \u03c4 \u223c 1. CP may change sign if \u03c4\nvaries strongly from optically thin to optically thick regime. Linear\npolarization does tend to zero when the mean rotativity (\u221d \u03b4 \u221d Bu ) is\nhigh. Thus CP, which is produced by conversion of LP, also decreases\nfor high \u03b4. (see Figure 3 and its caption for additional explanation).\n4.3. Quasar 3C279\nWardle et al. (1998) reported the discovery of circular and linear polarization in 3C 279 and attributed CP to internal Faraday conversion.\nTypical fractional linear and circular polarizations in 3C 279 are of\norder \u223c 10% and > 1%, respectively. They concluded that if the jet is\n\n11\n00\n00\n11\n00\n11\n00\n11\n\nFigure 3. This plot demonstrates how a uniform magnetic field can depolarize most\nof the intrinsically polarized radiation when emission is present along the line of\nsight. Arrows indicate uniform magnetic field. Circular diagrams show the orientation of the polarization vector. Locally generated linear polarization is always\ndenoted by a vertical line (i.e., 12 o'clock). Linearly polarized flux from the neighboring regions cancels out. The observed polarized radiation is generated in the\nregions closest to the observer.\n\ncpmr.tex; 24/12/2018; 23:27; p.6\n\n\fLinear and Circular Polarization Properties of Jets\n\n7\n\nFigure 4. Linear and circular polarization as a function of the ratio of the uniform\nto fluctuating components of magnetic field \u03b4 = Bu /Brms for different synchrotron\ndepths (upper labels). Curves within each panel correspond to different numbers of\nfield reversals N (for smaller N polarization levels are lower).\n\ncomposed of normal plasma, then the low-energy cut-off of the energy\ndistribution of relativistic electrons must be as high as \u03b3i \u223c 100 in\norder to avoid Faraday depolarization and overproduction of the jet\nkinetic power. They were unable to fit their polarization models to\nthe observational data for \u03b3i > 20 and thus claimed that the jet must\nbe pair-dominated. However, the above observational constraints on\nCP and LP and the jet energetics can be satisfied for a variety of\nmicroscopic plasma parameters. This is due to the fact that different\n\"microscopic\" parameters, such as \u03b3i , the ratio of the cold to relativistic\nelectron number densities, or the positron fraction, can lead to similar\n\"macroscopic\" parameters such as convertibility and rotativity. In order\nto illustrate this, I consider two radically different examples and show\nthat both cases can lead to the same CP and LP.\n4.3.1. Electron-proton jet\nIn this example, plasma is composed exclusively of a mixture of protons\nand electrons with both relativistic (r) and cold (c) populations being\npresent. For a low-energy cut-off \u03b3i \u223c 30 and an electron number\ndensity-weighted mean Lorentz factor \u03b3 \u223c 50 and \u03b1 = 0.5, we get\nh\u03b6v\u2217 i \u223c 80(nc /nr )\u03b4 and h\u03b6q\u2217 i \u223c \u22120.5. For the above choice of parameters,\nthe main contribution to rotativity comes from cold electrons as long\nas nc /nr > 5\u00d710\u22123 . The required levels of LP and CP can be obtained,\nfor example, when \u03c4 = 1, \u03b1 = 0.5, N = 15, 2\u2206\u03c6 = 35o , \u03b4 \u223c 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22121\n\ncpmr.tex; 24/12/2018; 23:27; p.7\n\n\f8\n\nMateusz Ruszkowski\n\nand (nc /nr ) = 7 \u00d7 10\u22122 . Bear in mind that the admixture of cold\nelectrons does not have to be large to explain the data. Interestingly,\na jet with such a plasma composition could carry roughly as small a\nkinetic power as the pure electron-positron jet with the same emissivity,\nsince the ratio of kinetic powers of an e-p jet to a pure relativistic e+ -e\u2212\njet is \u223c 18.4(h\u03b3ie+ e\u2212 /50)\u22121 (\u03b3i,e+ e\u2212 /\u03b3i,pe ).\n4.3.2. Electron-positron jet\nThe alternative possibility is that the jet is dominated by relativistic\npair plasma. For example, for \u03b3i = 2 and \u03b3 = 50 we get h\u03b6q\u2217 i \u223c \u22123.1 and\nh\u03b6v\u2217 i \u223c 1.4 \u00d7 102 \u03b4(np /ne\u2212 ). Agreement with the observed fractional LP\nand CP can be obtained for example when the jet is pair-dominated\nin the sense that ne\u2212 \u226b np , while being dominated dynamically by\nprotons. I was able to obtain the required polarization levels in this\ncase for \u03c4 = 1, N = 40, 2\u2206\u03c6 = 30o , \u03b4 \u223c 0.3 and np /ne\u2212 = 0.1. Recent theoretical work of (Sikora and Madejski, 2000) suggests that jets\nmay be pair-dominated numberwise but still dynamically dominated\nby protons.\n4.4. Galactic Center \u2013 Sgr A\u2217\nRecently (Bower et al., 1999) reported the detection of circular polarization from our Galactic Center (Sgr A\u2217 ) with the VLA, which was\nconfirmed by (Sault and Macquart, 1999) using ATCA. The typical\nlevel of CP in their observations was \u223c 0.3%, greater than the level\nof linear polarization. This result may seem surprising in light of the\nstrong limits on the ratio of CP to LP in AGN where CP/LP is usually much less than unity. However, as explained above, an excess of\nCP over LP can be explained easily in the framework of our model.\nArchival VLA data indicate that the mean CP was stable over ten\nyears (Bower, Falcke and Mellon, 2002). This is also not surprising\nas our model naturally predicts a persistent CP sign. The average\nCP spectrum was characterized by a flat to slightly positive spectral\nindex (\u03c0c \u221d \u03bd \u03b2 , \u03b2 > 0). This result can also be accounted for in our\nmodel. For example, in the framework of a self-absorbed, self-similar\njet model (Blandford and K\u00f6nigl, 1979) but with a small bias \u03b4 we\nhave h\u03b6v\u2217 i \u221d \u03b4 \u221d B \u221d \u03bd \u221d r \u22121 (see Figure 1). The minimum and\nmaximum size of Sgr A\u2217 constrain the brightness temperature to be\n1010 < Tb < 5 \u00d7 1011 K (Melia and Falcke, 2001), which is within the\nrange of typical AGN radio cores. Taking Tb \u223c 1011 as the representative rest frame value (Readhead, 1994), we get \u03b3 \u223c 50. The required\nlevels of CP and LP can be approximatelly obtained, for example, for\n\u03c4 = 1, N = 45, p = 1, \u03b1 = 0.5, \u03b3i = 3, \u03b3 \u223c 50 and \u03b4 = 0.35 (see Figure\n\ncpmr.tex; 24/12/2018; 23:27; p.8\n\n\fLinear and Circular Polarization Properties of Jets\n\n9\n\n5).\nIt has recently been suggested that observations of linear polarization can be used to constrain the accretion rate in Sgr A\u2217 and other\nlow-luminosity AGN (Agol, 2000; Quataert and Gruzinov, 2000). These\nauthors base their argument on the assumption that the Faraday rotation measure has to be sufficiently small in order not to suppress strong\nlinear polarization at higher frequencies (Aitken et al., 2000; Bower et\nal., 2002). This assumption places limits on density and magnetic field\nstrength and leads to very low accretion rates \u223c 10\u22128 to 10\u22129 M\u2299 yr\u22121 .\nHigh values of linear polarization at higher frequencies may originate\ncloser to the central black hole, where the bulk of the LP emitting\nmaterial may no longer be in the form of a self-absorbed jet but rather\nin the form of an accretion disk. As noted by Agol (2000) and Quataert\nand Gruzinov (2000), the above accretion rate is inconsistent with an\nadvection-dominated model for Sgr A\u2217 , which assumes that the accretion rate is of order the canonical Bondi rate \u223c 10\u22124 to 10\u22125 M\u2299 yr\u22121 .\nHowever, strong rotation measure does not in principle limit densities and magnetic fields provided that the field has a small magnetic\nflux associated with it, which is required to define the sign of circular\npolarization (note that the rotation angle is then reduced \u03b4\u22121 times).\n4.5. Low-luminosity AGN \u2013 M81\u2217\nCircular polarization was also detected in the compact radio jet of the\nnearby spiral galaxy M81 (Brunthaler et al., 2001). Their estimated\nvalues of CP were 0.27\u00b10.06\u00b10.07% at 4.8 GHz and 0.54\u00b10.06\u00b10.07%\nat 8.4 GHz, where errors are separated into statistical and systematic\nterms (see also Bower et al. 2002 for more results on LLAGN). This\nsuggests that the CP spectrum is flat or possibly inverted. They also\ndetected no linear polarization at a level of 0.1%, indicating that the\nsource has a high circular-to-linear polarization ratio. The spectral\nindex indicates that this source is synchrotron self-absorbed and we\ncan apply the same approach as for Sgr A\u2217 .\n\n5. Conclusions\nI have considered the transfer of polarized synchrotron radiation in jets\nand have argued that Faraday conversion is the primary mechanism\nresponsible for the circular polarization properties of compact radio\nsources. The modelis potentially applicable to a wide range of sources.\nA crucial ingredient of the model is a small bias in the highly turbulent\nmagnetic field which accounts for the persistence of the sign of circular\n\ncpmr.tex; 24/12/2018; 23:27; p.9\n\n\f10\n\nMateusz Ruszkowski\n\nFigure 5. Linear (decreasing curve) and circular polarization as a function of \u03b4 for\nSgr A\u2217 (intrinsic CP included)\n\npolarization. This bias is a direct evidence for the net magnetic flux\ncarried by magnetically accelerated jets (Blandford and Payne, 1982; Li\net al., 1992).\nExtremely large Faraday rotation per unit synchrotron absorption\ndepth, does not necessarily lead to depolarization provided that the\nmean rate of Faraday rotation across the source is relatively small, or\nin other words, that the turbulent magnetic field is characterized by a\nsmall magnetic flux. Indeed, a large Faraday rotativity is required in\norder to explain the high ratio of circular to linear polarization observed\nin some sources (Galactic Center, M81\u2217 ). Constraints on jet composition or accretion rate, based on the requirement that the source does\nnot become Faraday depolarized, may be circumvented under these\nconditions.\nGradients in Faraday rotation across turbulent cells can lead to\ncorrelations between rotativity and Stokes Q and U parameters, which\ncan result in \"correlation depolarization\". Variations in the mean parameters are unlikely to change the helicity of circular polarization\nunless a source undergoes a sharp transition from very low to very\nhigh synchrotron depth.\n\nAcknowledgements\nI thank Mitch Begelman for collaboration on this project.
