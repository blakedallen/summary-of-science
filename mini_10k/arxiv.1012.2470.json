Introduction\nFor any semigroup S with zero, we denote by Z(S) the set of zero\u2013divisors, Z(S) =\n{x \u2208 S; there exists 0 6= y \u2208 S such that xy = 0 or yx = 0}. We denote by \u0393(S)\nthe zero\u2013divisor graph of S. The vertex set V (\u0393(S)) of \u0393(S) is the set of elements in\nZ(S)\u2217 = Z(S) \\ {0} and an unordered pair of vertices x, y \u2208 V (\u0393(S)), x 6= y, is an edge\nx \u2212 y in \u0393(S) if xy = 0 or yx = 0.\nSimilarly, we can define the zero\u2013divisor graphs of other algebraic structures, e.g. rings,\nsemirings, near-rings, algebras.\nThe zero\u2013divisor graphs of rings have been first introduced by Beck in [11] in the study\nof commutative rings, and later studied by various authors, see for example [1, 2, 3, 7,\n5, 8, 12, 14, 21, 24]. The zero\u2013divisor graphs are also intensely studied in the semigroup\nsetting, e.g. [16, 17, 18, 19]. Recently, they were used to study near-rings (see e.g. [13])\nand semirings (see e.g. [9, 10]).\nIn this paper we investigate the interplay between the algebraic properties of a (semi)ring\nand the graph theoretic properties of its zero\u2013divisor graph. In the next section, we give\nall necessary definitions. In Section 3, we survey some of the known results of the theory of\nthe zero\u2013divisor graphs over semigroups, rings, and semirings, and extend these results to\na more general setting of a noncommutative semiring and we characterize all acyclic zero\u2013\ndivisor graphs of semirings (Theorem 3.9). Next, we study the cyclic zero\u2013divisor graphs.\nFirstly, we characterize the complete k-partite and regular zero\u2013divisor graphs that can\nappear as the zero\u2013divisor graphs of commutative semirings (Theorem 4.2 and Corollary\n4.3). In the case the zero\u2013divisor graph of a commutative semiring contains at most one\ntriangle, we find all possible zero\u2013divisor graphs (Theorems 6.4 and 7.5, Proposition 7.1).\nIf the zero\u2013divisor graph of a commutative semiring is cyclic and contains no triangles,\nDate: October 27, 2018.\n2010 Mathematics Subject Classification. 05C25, 16Y60, 13M99.\nKey words and phrases. ring, semiring, zero-divisor, graph.\n1\n\n\fwe describe the order of the nilpotent elements in the semiring (Proposition 6.5). In\nthe case the zero\u2013divisor graph of an additively cancellative semiring contains exactly\none triangle, we prove that the semiring has to be a ring (Proposition 7.7) and we then\nproceed to characterize all rings and their zero\u2013divisor graphs containing exactly one\ntriangle (Theorem 8.4).\n\n2. Definitions\nA semiring is a set S equipped with binary operations + and * such that (S, +) is a\ncommutative monoid with identity element 0, and (S, *) is a monoid with identity element\n1. In addition, operations + and * are connected by distributivity and 0 annihilates S. A\nsemiring is commutative if ab = ba for all a, b \u2208 S. A semiring is entire (or zero\u2013divisorfree) if ab = 0 implies that a = 0 or b = 0. The semiring S is additively cancellative if\na + c = b + c implies that a = b for all a, b, c \u2208 S.\nThe simplest example of a commutative semiring is the binary Boolean semiring, the\nset {0, 1} in which 1 + 1 = 1 * 1 = 1. We denote the binary Boolean semiring by B.\nMoreover, the set of nonnegative integers (or reals) with the usual operations of addition\nand multiplication, is a commutative semiring. Other examples of commutative semirings\nare distributive lattices, tropical semirings etc.\nThe sequence of edges x0 \u2212 x1 , x1 \u2212 x2 , ..., xk\u22121 \u2212 xk in a graph is called a path of length\nk and is denoted by x0 \u2212 x1 \u2212 . . . \u2212 xk or Pk+1 . The distance between two vertices is the\nlength of the shortest path between them. The diameter diam(\u0393) of the graph \u0393 is the\nlongest distance between any two vertices of the graph. A path x0 \u2212 x1 \u2212 . . . \u2212 xk\u22121 \u2212 x0\nis called a cycle. The girth of the graph \u0393 is the length of the shortest cycle contained in\nthe graph and will be denoted by girth(\u0393).\nThe complete graph will be denoted by Kn and complete bipartite graph by Km,n . We\nsay that the star graph is a complete bipartite graph K1,n . Note that K1,0 = K1 . The\ntwo-star graph Sm,n , where n, m \u2208 N \u222a {0}, is a graph with the set of vertices equal to the\nset {v1 , v2 , u1 , u2 , . . . , um , w1 , w2 , . . . , wn }, and with the following edges: v1 \u2212 v2 , ui \u2212 v1\nfor i = 1, 2, . . . , m, and wj \u2212 v2 for j = 1, 2, . . . , n. Note that S0,n = K1,n+1 is a star graph.\n\nS3,5 :\n\nr\n\nLet K m,n be the complete bipartite graph Km,n together with r vertices v1 , v2 , . . . , vr\nand edges vi \u2212 a for all i and some vertex a, such that deg(a) = n in the induced subgraph\nr\nKm,n .

The zero\u2013divisor graph of a semiring\nLet us investigate the zero\u2013divisor graph of an arbitrary (possibly noncommutative)\nsemiring.\nFirstly, we shall prove that the zero\u2013divisor graphs of (noncommutative) semirings are\nalways connected and have diameters at most 3. This is a similar result to [24, Thm. 3.2]\n(for rings) and [9, Lemma 2.1] (for commutative semirings).\nTheorem 3.1. If S is a semiring, then diam(\u0393(S)) \u2264 3.\nProof. Take x, y \u2208 Z(S)\u2217 , such that xy 6= 0 and yx 6= 0. We want to show that there is a\npath from x to y and d(x, y) \u2264 3.\nThere exist a, b \u2208 Z(S)\u2217 , such that ax = 0 or xa = 0 and by = 0 or yb = 0. Note\nthat here, a can be equal to x, as well as b equal to y. If a = b, ab = 0, ba = 0, ay = 0,\nya = 0, bx = 0 or xb = 0, then d(x, y) \u2264 3. So, suppose, none of the above is true. In the\ncase ax = 0, we have that either x \u2212 ba \u2212 y or x \u2212 ya \u2212 b \u2212 y is a path joining x and y.\nOtherwise, if xa = 0, either x \u2212 ab \u2212 y or x \u2212 ay \u2212 b \u2212 y is a path from x to y. All of these\nfour paths are of length at most 3, even if some of the vertices coincide, and therefore\nd(x, y) \u2264 3.\n\u0004\nAnderson and Mulay [8, Thm. 2.8] proved that for direct products of integral domains\nand their subrings, the diameter is at most 2. We generalize this result to noncommutative\nentire semirings.\nProposition 3.2. If S1 and S2 are entire semirings and S \u2286 S1 \u00d7 S2 is a semiring. If\n\u0393(S) 6= \u2205, then diam(\u0393(S)) \u2264 2.\nProof. If S \u2286 S1 \u00d7 S2 , where S1 and S2 are entire semirings, then (s1 , s2 ) \u2208 Z(S)\u2217 implies\nthat either s1 = 0 or s2 = 0.\nAssume diam(\u0393(S)) \u2265 2. Then, there exist x, y \u2208 Z(S)\u2217 , such that xy 6= 0, yx 6= 0.\nWithout loss of generality, let us assume that x = (x1 , 0). This implies that y = (y1 , 0).\nSince \u0393(S) is a connected graph, there exists an edge x \u2212 z in \u0393(S) and z = (0, z1 ). Thus\nx \u2212 y \u2212 z is a path in \u0393(S) and diam(\u0393(S)) \u2264 2.\n\u0004\nIn the following examples we show that some families of the graphs with diam(\u0393) \u2264 2\ncan be realized as the zero\u2013divisor graphs of semirings. We will later need the realization\nof these families of graphs in the characterization of complete k-partite and regular zero\u2013\ndivisor graphs.\n3\n\n\fWe will denote by Mn (S) the set of all n \u00d7 n matrices over a semiring S. The matrix\nwith the only nonzero entry 1 in the ith row and jth column will be denoted by Ei,j . The\nmatrix In will denote the n \u00d7 n identity matrix, 0n will denote the n \u00d7 n zero matrix and\nJn will denote the matrix E\u00141,2 + E\u00152,3 + . . . + En\u22121,n . Also, let us denote by A \u2295 B the\nA 0\ndirect sum of matrix blocks\n.\n0 B\nExample 3.3. We can realize all complete bipartite graphs as zero\u2013divisor graphs of a\ndirect product of two semirings. Namely, if S and T are arbitrary entire semirings with\n|S| = m + 1 and |T | = n + 1, then \u0393(S \u00d7 T ) = Kn,m . Such S and T exist, for example we\ncan choose totally ordered sets of appropriate cardinality.\n\u0003\nExample 3.4. Anderson and Livingston [7, Thm. 2.8] proved that if the zero\u2013divisor graph\nof a commutative ring R with 1 is equal to \u0393(R) = Kn , n \u2265 3, then all zero\u2013divisors are\nnilpotents of order 2. This statement does not hold for semirings. However, we can show\nthat if S is a commutative semiring and \u0393(S) = Kn , n \u2265 3, then x2 = 0 for all but possibly\none x \u2208 Z(S)\u2217 .\nSuppose Z(S)\u2217 = {a1 , a2 . . . , an } and a21 6= 0. Since \u0393(S) = Kn , it follows that ai aj = 0\nfor all i 6= j, and therefore a1 (a1 + ai ) = a21 6= 0 for i 6= 1. Since aj (a1 + ai ) = 0 for\nall j 6= i, j, i 6= 1, it follows that a1 + ai \u2208 Z(S)\u2217 , thus a1 + ai = a1 for all i 6= 1. By\nmultiplying this equation by ai , we have a2i = 0 for all i 6= 1.\nMoreover, such semirings S indeed exist. Consider a semiring S in M2n\u22121 (B), generated by ai = J n\u22122+i + J n\u22121+i + . . . + J 2n\u22122 , where i = 1, 2, . . . , n. Since J 2n\u22121 = 0, we\nhave ai aj = 0 for all i, j = 1, 2, . . . , n but for i = j = 1. Therefore \u0393(S) = Kn , a2i = 0 for\n\u0003\nall i 6= 1 and a21 6= 0.\nThe\ngraphs\n[7, Ex.\ncannot\n\nnext two examples show that we can also realize all possible star and two-star\nas the zero\u2013divisor graphs of (even commutative) semirings. Compare this with\n2.1] where it has been shown that for a commutative ring, the zero\u2013divisor graph\nbe equal to P4 = S1,1 .\n\nExample 3.5. Let Mn+1 (B) be the semiring of n + 1 by n + 1 matrices over the Boolean\nsemiring, where n \u2265 1, and denote by S the subsemiring generated by the set {I1 \u2295 0n , 01 \u2295\nIn , 01 \u2295 In + Jn }. The zero\u2013divisors in the semiring S are of two types, I1 \u2295 0n and\n01 \u2295 (In + Jn + Jn2 + . . . + Jnk ) for k = 0, 1, . . . n \u2212 1. It can be easily verified that then only\nthe products of the element I1 \u2295 0n with 01 \u2295 (In + Jn + Jn2 + . . . + Jnk ) are equal to zero\nfor all k, so \u0393(S) = K1,n = S0,n\u22121 .\nObviously, we can realize the graph K1 = K1,0 as the zero\u2013divisor graph of a semiring,\nfor example the (semi)ring Z4 .\n\u0003\nExample 3.6. Choose n, m \u2208 N. Let L = {0, x1 , x2 , x3 , . . . , 1} be any totally ordered\n(distributive) lattice containing at least max{n, m} nonzero elements. Then L is also an\nentire semiring for the operations xi + xj = xmax{i,j} and xi * xj = xi xj = xmin{i,j} .\nNow, let M4 (L) denote the semiring of all 4\u00d7 4 matrices over L. Denote v1 = 02 \u2295 x1 J2\nand v2 = (x1 (I2 + J2 )) \u2295 02 . For i = 1, 2, . . . , n define ui = (x1 I2 + xi J2 ) \u2295 x1 J2 , and for\n4\n\n\fj = 1, 2, . . . , m define wj = 02 \u2295 (xj (I2 + J2 )). Let S denote the subsemiring of M4 (L),\ngenerated by the elements v1 , v2 , u1 , u2 , . . . , un , w1 , w2 , . . . , wm .\nIt can be easily seen, that since L is entire and antinegative, we do not get any zero\u2013\ndivisors in S that are not already amongst the generating elements. So, the zero\u2013divisor\ngraph of S consists of edges v1 \u2212v2 , ui \u2212v1 for i = 1, 2, . . . , n, and wj \u2212v2 for j = 1, 2, . . . , m,\nwhich implies that \u0393(S) = Sn,m is a two-star graph.\n\u0003\nWe shall now see, that we can consider the case of cyclic zero\u2013divisor graphs separately\nfrom the case of acyclic ones. We will find all possible acyclic graphs that can be realized\nas zero\u2013divisor graphs of semirings, and for the cyclic graphs, we shall prove that they\nalways contain at least one cycle of length at most 4.\nLemma 3.7. If P5 is a subgraph of \u0393(S), where S is an arbitrary semiring, then \u0393(S) is\na cyclic graph and girth(\u0393(S)) \u2264 4.\nProof. Denote by a \u2212 b \u2212 c \u2212 d \u2212 e the path P5 in \u0393(S). Suppose that girth(\u0393(S)) > 4,\ni.e., there are no edges among other vertices from this path.\nConsider first the case ba = bc = 0. Since eb 6= 0 and (eb)a = (eb)c = 0, we have that\neb = b. (Otherwise, there is a cycle of length 3 or 4 in \u0393(S).) Similarly, we conclude\nthat db = b. Since d \u2212 e is an edge in \u0393(S), we have either that de = 0, and thus\ndb = dbe = 0, or ed = 0, and therefore eb = edb = 0, which both contradict the asumption\nthat girth(\u0393(S)) > 4.\nSimilarly, we can treat the case ab = cb = 0.\nSuppose now ab = bc = 0 and ba 6= 0, cb 6= 0. By Theorem 3.1, we have that d(a, e) \u2264 3.\nSince girth(\u0393(S)) > 4, the path from a to e of the length at most 3 cannot contain any of\nvertices b, c, d. If d(a, e) = 3 and a \u2212 x \u2212 y \u2212 e is a path from a to e, we obtain a cycle\na \u2212 b \u2212 c \u2212 d \u2212 e \u2212 y \u2212 x \u2212 a of length 7. Note that if d(a, e) = 2, then we can assume\nthat y = x and if d(a, e) = 1, then e = y = x. In all three cases, let us assume, that\na \u2212 x is an edge in \u0393(S). If we assumed ax = 0, we would get a contradiction as in the\ncase ba = bc = 0. Thus, from now, let xa = 0. Since girth(\u0393(S)) > 4 and b(cx) = 0, the\nproduct cx is either equal to a, b, c or is an element, different from a, b, c, d, e, f, x, y. In the\nfirst case, a2 = (cx)a = 0 and therefore a \u2212 ac \u2212 x \u2212 a is a 3-cycle in \u0393(S), a contradiction.\nIn the second case, ba = (cx)a = 0, which is again a contradiction. Otherwise, b\u2212cx\u2212a\u2212b\nis a cycle of length 3.\n\u0004\nCorollary 3.8. The cycle on n vertices, n \u2265 5, cannot be realized as \u0393(S), where S is a\nsemiring.\nWe can now prove the theorem that generalizes [8, Thm. 2.4, Thm. 2.5] and provides a\ncharacterization of all acyclic zero\u2013divisor graphs over semirings.\nTheorem 3.9. Let S be a non\u2013entire semiring.\n(a.) If \u0393(S) is a cyclic graph, then diam(\u0393(S)) \u2264 3 and girth(\u0393(S)) \u2264 4.\n(b.) \u0393 is an acyclic zero\u2013divisor graph of a non\u2013entire semiring if and only if \u0393 = Sn,m\nor \u0393 = K1 .\n5\n\n\fProof. If \u0393(S) is a cyclic graph which contains a cycle of length 5 or more, then it also\ncontains P5 . By Lemma 3.7, it follows girth(\u0393(S)) \u2264 4. Note that diam(\u0393(S)) \u2264 3 by\nTheorem 3.1. Assume now that \u0393(S) is acyclic and contains at least 2 vertices. Again by\nLemma 3.7, we know that it does not contain P5 , so the only possibility is that \u0393(S) = Sn,m\nfor some n, m. The converse of (b.) follows from Examples 3.5 and 3.6.\n\u0004\nThis result characterizes the acyclic zero\u2013divisor graphs of (non)-commutative semirings. In the following sections we will examine the cyclic zero\u2013divisor graphs of commutative semirings.\n\n4. The complete k-partite and regular zero\u2013divisor graphs of commutative\nsemirings\nIn this section we investigate two special families of cyclic graphs, complete k-partite\nand regular graphs. DeMeyer et al. [18] showed that all complete k-partite graphs are\nzero\u2013divisor graphs of commutative semigroups, and (see Theorem 4.1) characterized all\nregular graphs that can appear as the zero\u2013divisor graphs of commutative semigroups.\nIn the semiring setting, these two assertions no longer hold, and in Theorem 4.2 and\nCorollary 4.3 we shall characterize complete k-partite and regular graphs that can appear\nas the zero\u2013divisor graphs of commutative semirings.\nTheorem 4.1 (DeMeyer, Greve, Sabbaghi, Wang [18]). Let \u0393 be a connected k-regular\ngraph with n vertices. Then \u0393 is a zero\u2013divisor graph of a commutative semigroup if and\nW\nonly if n \u2212 k|n and \u0393 = n/(n\u2212k) (n \u2212 k) K1 .\nTheorem 4.2. Let \u0393 be a complete k-partite graph with n vertices and k \u2265 2. Then\nW \u0393 is\na zero\u2013divisor graph of a commutative semiring if and only if k = 2 or \u0393 = Kk\u22121 (n \u2212\nk + 1) K1 .\nW W\nW\nProof. Since \u0393 is connected, we have k \u2265 2. Suppose \u0393 W\n= C1 C2 . . . Ck is a complete\nk-partite zero\u2013divisor graph with k \u2265 3. If \u0393 6= Kk\u22121 (n \u2212 k + 1) K1 , then there exist,\nsay C1 and C2 with |C1 | \u2265 2 and |C2 | \u2265 2. Let a1 , b1 \u2208 C1 , a2 , b2 \u2208 C2 and c \u2208 C3 . Since\na1 c = a2 c = 0, it follows that (a1 + a2 )c = 0, so a1 + a2 \u2208 Z(S). If a1 + a2 \u2208\n/ C1 , then\n(a1 + a2 )b1 = 0 and thus a1 b1 = 0, a contradiction. Therefore, a1 + a2 \u2208 C1 and similarly\nwe obtain a1 + a2 \u2208 C2 which is also a contradiction.\nExample 3.3 shows that Km,n can be realized as the zero\u2013divisor graph of a commutative\nsemiring. Choose an integer k, 3 \u2264 k \u2264 n\u22121 and consider the subsemiring S \u2286 M2n+1 (B),\ngenerated by matrices {Ai , B, Cj ; 2 \u2264 i \u2264 n\u2212k+1, 2n\u2212k+2 \u2264 j \u2264 2n}, where J = J2n+1 ,\nB = J n + J n+1 + . . . + J 2n , Cj = J j + J j+1 + . . . + J 2n and Ai = [aist ] are the matrices\nwith entries\n(\n0, t \u2212 s < n or s = i, t = i + n,\naist =\n1, otherwise.\nW\nObserve\nW that S is a semiring with \u0393(S) = {C1 , C2 , . . . , Ck } {A1 , A2 , . . . , An\u2212k+1 , B} =\nKk\u22121 (n \u2212 k + 1) K1 .\n\u0004\n6\n\n\fCorollary 4.3. Let \u0393 be a r-regular graph with n vertices. Then \u0393 is a zero\u2013divisor graph\nof a commutative semiring if and only if r = n \u2212 1 and \u0393 = Kn , or n even, r = n2 and\n\u0393 = K n2 , n2 .\nProof. Assume that \u0393 is a zero\u2013divisor graph of a semiring. Then, \u0393 is connected by\nn\nTheorem 3.1 and thus by 4.1, \u0393 is a join of n\u2212r\ncopies of (n \u2212 r) K1 , which is a complete\nn\n-partite\ngraph.\nNow,\nTheorem\n4.2\nimplies\nthat\nthere are two possibilities. In the first\nn\u2212r\nn\ncase, n\u2212r = 2 and thus \u0393 is a r-regular bipartite graph with r = n2 , so \u0393 = K n2 , n2 . In the\nW\nr\nr\nr\n) K1 . Since \u0393 is r-regular, it follows that n \u2212 1 = n\u2212r\nsecond case, \u0393 = K n\u2212r\n(n \u2212 n\u2212r\nand therefore r = n \u2212 1, so \u0393 = Kn .\nExamples 3.3 and 3.4 show that Kn and K n2 , n2 can both be realized as the zero\u2013divisor\ngraphs of commutative semirings.\n\u0004\n\n5. The cyclic zero\u2013divisor graphs\nIn this section we will study the cyclic zero\u2013divisor graphs of commutative semirings. By\nTheorem 3.9 every cyclic zero\u2013divisor graph has a 3-cycle or a 4-cycle. We will define the\nfollowing graphs, which we shall prove are the graphs that cannot appear as the induced\nsubgraphs of a cyclic zero\u2013divisor graph of a commutative semiring.\n\u2022 C4,4 , which is a graph consisting of two cycles a \u2212 b \u2212 c \u2212 d \u2212 a and a \u2212 b \u2212 f \u2212 e \u2212 a\nwith the common edge a \u2212 b, and\n\u2022 C4\u2032 , which is a 4-cycle a\u2212 b\u2212 c\u2212 d\u2212 a together with two vertices e and f , connected\nwith edges a \u2212 e and b \u2212 f ,\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2022 C4 , which is a 4-cycle a\u2212b\u2212c\u2212d\u2212a together with two vertices e and f , connected\nwith edges a \u2212 e and c \u2212 f ,\ne\na\n\nb\n\nc\n\nd\n\nC4,3 :\n\nMoreover, let us define the graph C4,3 , which is a graph consisting of a 4-cycle a \u2212 b \u2212\nc \u2212 d \u2212 a and a 3-cycle a \u2212 b \u2212 e \u2212 a with the common edge a \u2212 b.\nWe can now state the following lemma.\nLemma 5.1. Let S be a commutative semiring and let the graph \u0393(S) contain exactly one\n3-cycle and at least one n-cycle, n \u2265 4. Then, \u0393(S) contains C4,3 as an induced subgraph.\n7\n\n\fProof. Let n \u2265 4 be the smallest integer, such that \u0393(S) contains an n-cycle x1 \u2212 x2 \u2212 x3 \u2212\n. . . \u2212 xn \u2212 x1 . If x1 x3 = 0, we obtain a n \u2212 1 cycle in the graph \u0393(S) and thus n = 4 and \u0393\nhas two 3-cycles, a contradiction. Since (x1 x3 )x2 = (x1 x3 )x4 = (x1 x3 )xn = 0, either x1 x3\nis a vertex on the cycle or x1 x3 6= xi for all i. In both cases \u0393(S) contains a 4-cycle.\nSuppose \u0393(S) contains a 4-cycle a \u2212 b \u2212 c \u2212 d \u2212 a and a 3-cycle e \u2212 f \u2212 g \u2212 e. We shall\nfirstly prove that they have a common vertex.\nChoose an arbitrary vertex in the 3-cycle, say e. If e is a neighbour of at least 2 vertices\nfrom the 4-cycle (say, one of them is a), then note that either \u0393(S) contains more than one\n3-cycle (which contradicts the assumption), or the only other neighbour of e in the 4-cycle\nis c. In the latter case \u0393(S) contains a 4-cycle (either a \u2212 e \u2212 c \u2212 b \u2212 a or a \u2212 e \u2212 c \u2212 d \u2212 a)\nand the 3-cycle e \u2212 f \u2212 g \u2212 e with the common vertex e. So, suppose every vertex in\nthe 3-cycle e \u2212 f \u2212 g \u2212 e has at most one neighbour in the 4-cycle. In this case, there\nexists a vertex in the 4-cycle, say a, such that ae 6= 0. Since (ae)f = (ae)g = 0 and\n\u0393(S) has only one 3-cycle, it follows that ae is an element of {e, f, g}. On the other hand,\n(ae)b = (ae)d = 0, so ae has at least 2 neighbours in the 4-cycle. It follows that ae = c\nand 4-cycle and 3-cycle have a common vertex.\nWe proved that 3-cycle and 4-cycle have a common vertex, for instance d = g. If a = e,\nthen the Lemma is proven. Otherwise, since the graph contains only one 3-cycle, ae 6= 0\nand (ae)d = (ae)f = 0 imples that ae is an element of {d, e, f }. Moreover, (ae)b = 0 and\nthus \u0393(S) contains C4,3 , since \u0393(S) may contain only one 3-cycle.\n\u0004\nLemma 5.2. Let S be a commutative semiring with girth(\u0393(S)) = 4. Then C4\u2032 cannot\nappear as an induced subgraph of \u0393(S).\nProof. Suppose that \u0393(S) contains C4\u2032 , which is a 4-cycle a \u2212 b \u2212 c \u2212 d \u2212 a together\nwith two vertices e and f , connected with edges a \u2212 e and b \u2212 f . Firstly, ef 6= 0 and\n(ef )a = (ef )b = 0. Again, since girth(\u0393(S)) > 3, it follows that either ef = a or ef = b.\nBy the symmetry, we can assume that ef = a. Now, e(f d) = (ef )d = 0 and moreover\na(f d) = b(f d) = c(f d) = 0. Since f d 6= 0 and girth(\u0393(S)) > 3, the product f d cannot\nexist as a vertex in \u0393(S).\n\u0004\nLemma 5.3. Let S be a commutative semiring with \u0393(S) containing at most one 3-cycle.\nThen neither C4\u2032\u2032 , C4,4 , nor C4,5 can appear as induced subgraphs of \u0393(S).\nProof. Suppose \u0393(S) contains C4,4 as an induced subgraph, i.e. \u0393(S) contains vertices\na, b, c, d, e, f , where the only edges are a \u2212 b \u2212 c \u2212 d \u2212 a and a \u2212 b \u2212 f \u2212 e \u2212 a. Consider\nthe product ce. Clearly, (ce)a = (ce)b = (ce)d = (ce)f = 0 and ce 6= 0, and since \u0393(S)\ncontains at most one 3-cycle, such vertex ce cannot exist in \u0393(S).\nIf \u0393(S) contains C4,5 as an induced subgraph, i.e. \u0393(S) contains vertices a, b, c, d, e, f ,\nwhere the only edges are a \u2212 b \u2212 c \u2212 d \u2212 a and a \u2212 b \u2212 c \u2212 f \u2212 e \u2212 a, then similarly as in\n(1), ce 6= 0 is a zero divisor in S, but cannot exist as a vertex in \u0393(S).\n\u2032\u2032\nIf \u0393(S) contains C4 , which is a 4-cycle a \u2212 b \u2212 c \u2212 d \u2212 a together with two vertices e and\nf , connected with edges a \u2212 e and c \u2212 f , note that ce 6= 0 and (ce)a = (ce)b = (ce)d =\n(ce)f = 0. Since \u0393(S) contains at most one 3-cycle, it follows that ce cannot exist as a\nvertex in \u0393(S).\n\u0004\n8\n\n\f6. Commutative semirings with zero\u2013divisor graphs of girth 4\nIn this section we shall describe the zero\u2013divisor graphs of commutative semirings with\ntheir girth equal to 4.\nIf the semiring is a ring, the structure of the ring itself can be deduced from the properties of its zero\u2013divisor graph. Anderson and Mulay, [8, Theorems 2.3 and 2.4] have\ncharacterized commutative rings R with girth(\u0393(R)) = 4. Their findings about this can\nbe summarized in the following theorem.\nTheorem 6.1 (Anderson, Mulay, [8]). If R is a commutative ring with identity such that\ngirth(\u0393(R)) = 4, then\n(1) either \u0393(R) = Km,n , m, n \u2265 2 and the total quotient ring of R is a direct product\nof two fields F1 \u00d7 F2 , |Fi | \u2265 3,\nm\n(2) or \u0393(R) = K 3,m and R = D \u00d7 B, where D is an integral domain with at least 3\nelements and B \u2208 {Z4 , Z2 [X]/(X 2 )}.\nThe following examples show that there exist large families of commutative semirings\nr\nwith their zero\u2013divisor graphs equal to K n,m .\nExample 6.2. Let S = {0, a1 , a2 , . . . , am\u22121 , 1} be a totally ordered lattice and T \u2286\nn\u22122\nMn\u22121 (B) the commutative semiring, generated by A = Jn\u22121\nand B = In\u22121 + Jn\u22121 . Note\nthat Z(S) = {0} and Z(T ) = {0, A}. Then, Z(S \u00d7 T ) consists of two types of elements\n(s, t) \u2208 S \u00d7 T : the first type are those having s = 0 or t = 0, which form the induced\nsubgraph Kn,m of \u0393(S \u00d7 T ); the second type are the elements having t = A, which are all\nm\n\u0003\nneighbours of the vertex (0, A). Thus, \u0393(S \u00d7 T ) = K n,m .\n\nExample 6.3. Let S = M2 (B) and consider the semiring S 2n\u22123 for some k \u2208 N. Denote\nby ei the element in S 2n\u22123 , which has its only nonzero entry equal to I2 in the i-th position\nand moreover let I = I2 and J = J2 . Let us define the following elements:\na = Je1\nb = e2\nj\nP\ncj = (I + J)e1 +\nJe2i+1 for j = 1, 2, . . . , n \u2212 2\nd = e2 + e4\ne=\n\nn\u22122\nP\ni=0\n\nJe2i+1 +\n\ni=1\nn\u22122\nP\n\ne2i\n\ni=1\n\nConsider the semiring T generated by {1, a, b, c1 , c2 , . . . , cn\u22122 , d, e} and observe that \u0393(T ) =\n3\nK n,2 .\n\u0003\nThe following theorem shows that all zero\u2013divisor graphs with their girth equal to 4 are\nactually of this form.\nr\n\nTheorem 6.4. If S is a commutative semiring and girth(\u0393(S)) = 4 then \u0393(S) = K m,n .\n9\n\n\fProof. Since girth(\u0393(S)) = 4, \u0393(S) contains K2,2 as induced subgraph. We proceed\n\u03c1\ninductively by adding vertices while always maintaining \u0393(S) = K \u03bc,\u03bd for some \u03c1, \u03bc, \u03bd.\n\u03c1\nAssume that we have in \u0393(S) an induced subgraph K \u03bc,\u03bd , \u03bc, \u03bd \u2265 2. Let us decompose\n\u03c1\nthe vertex set of K \u03bc,\u03bd into 3 sets: V1 = {v; deg v = 1} (possibly empty), V2 and V3 are\nthe bipartite parts of K\u03bc,\u03bd , where each vertex in V3 has degree \u03bc. Moreover, let a \u2208 V2 be\nthe vertex with deg(a) = \u03bd + \u03c1. If \u03c1 = 0, then choose a to be any vertex in V2 .\n\u03c1\nChoose any vertex x \u2208 \u0393(S), that is not in K \u03bc,\u03bd .\n\u2022 If x \u2212 v is an edge for some v \u2208 V1 , then by Theorem 3.1, x \u2212 w is an edge for\nsome w \u2208 V2 \u222a V3 . If w \u2208 V2 , then \u0393(S) contains C4,5 as an induced subgraph,\nand if w \u2208 V3 , then \u0393(S) contains C4,4 as an induced subgraph. Both conclusions\ncontradict Lemma 5.3.\n\u03c1+1\n\u2022 If deg(x) = 1 and x \u2212 a is an edge, or V1 = \u2205, then we get K \u03bc,\u03bd .\n\u2022 If V1 6= \u2205 and deg(x) = 1, then if x \u2212 v is an edge for some v \u2208 V2 \\{a}, then \u0393(S)\ncontains C4\u2032\u2032 as an induced subgraph and otherwise, if x \u2212 v is an edge for some\nv \u2208 V3 , then \u0393(S) contains C4\u2032 as an induced subgraph, which contradicts Lemma\n5.2.\n\u2022 If deg(x) \u2265 2 and w \u2212 x \u2212 v is a path, then v, w \u2208 V2 or v, w \u2208 V3 . (Otherwise,\ngirth(\u0393(S)) = 3.) Say, v, w \u2208 V2 . Suppose there exists u \u2208 V2 such that xu 6=\n0. Now, (xu)y = (xu)w = (xu)v = 0 for all y \u2208 V3 , and this contradicts the\nassumption that girth(\u0393(S)) = 4. Thus, x \u2212 u is an edge in \u0393(S) for all u \u2208 V2 , so\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\n\u0004\nwe get K \u03bc,\u03bd+1 . Similarly, if v, w \u2208 V3 , we get K \u03bc+1,\u03bd .\n\nThe next observation is a semiring generalization of a result that appears in [6] for the\nring theoretic case.\n\nProposition 6.5. If S is a commutative semiring with girth(\u0393(S)) = 4, then all nilpotents\nare of the order equal to 2.\n\nProof. Note that since girth(\u0393(S)) = 4, graph \u0393(S) does not contain any triangles.\nSuppose x \u2208 N (S) and xn = 0, xn\u22121 6= 0, n \u2265 3. Thus, x \u2212 xn\u22121 is an edge in \u0393(S).\nNote that deg(x) = 1 since otherwise xy = 0 implies that x \u2212 y \u2212 xn\u22121 \u2212 x is a triangle in\n\u0393(S).\nIn \u0393(S) there exists a 4-cycle a \u2212 b \u2212 c \u2212 d \u2212 a and since diam(\u0393(S)) \u2264 3, it follows\nthat xn\u22121 \u2208 {a, b, c, d}. Say, xn\u22121 = d. Then (bx)xn\u22121 = (bx)a = (bx)c = 0 and bx 6= 0.\nSince \u0393(S) does not contain any triangles, bx = xn\u22121 . Similarly, bxn\u22121 = xn\u22121 . Now,\nxn\u22121 = bxn\u22121 = bxxn\u22122 = x2n\u22123 = 0, which is a contradiction. It follows that n = 2. \u0004\n\n10\n\n\f7. Commutative semirings having zero\u2013divisor graphs with one 3-cycle\nWe now proceed to a description of all graphs with their girths equal to 3, with an\nadditional assumption that they contain exactly one 3-cycle.\nThe main purpose of the last two sections is to obtain the characterization of all rings\n(or equivalently all additively cancellative semirings) having the zero\u2013divisor graph with\none 3-cycle, which is a step towards the characterization of rings with the girth of their\nzero\u2013divisor graph equal to 3.\nProposition 7.1. If S is a commutative semiring and \u0393(S) contains exactly one 3-cycle,\n\u25b3(r ,r ,r )\nthen \u0393(S) = Km,n 1 2 3 .\nProof. If \u0393(S) contains an n-cycle for some n \u2265 4 then it also contains C4,3 , a \u2212 b \u2212 c \u2212\nd \u2212 a \u2212 e \u2212 d \u2212 a as an induced subgraph by Lemma 5.1.\nWe proceed by adding arbitrary vertices from \u0393(S) to this subgraph, while showing that\n\u25b3(\u03c1 ,\u03c1 ,\u03c1 )\nin the process we always maintain the structure of \u0393(S) = K \u03bc,\u03bd 1 2 3 for some \u03c1, \u03bc, \u03bd.\n\u25b3(\u03c11 ,\u03c12 ,\u03c13 )\n\nAssume that in \u0393(S), we have an induced subgraph K \u03bc,\u03bd\n\n, \u03bc, \u03bd \u2265 2. Let us\n\n\u25b3(\u03c1 ,\u03c1 ,\u03c1 )\nK \u03bc,\u03bd 1 2 3\n\ndecompose the vertex set of\ninto 4 sets: V1 = {v; deg v = 1} (possibly\nempty), V2 and V3 are the bipartite parts of K\u03bc,\u03bd , where each vertex in V3 has degree \u03bc,\nand V4 = {e}, the top of the 3-cycle.\n\u25b3(\u03c1 ,\u03c1 ,\u03c1 )\nChoose any vertex x \u2208 \u0393(S), that is not in K \u03bc,\u03bd 1 2 3 and add it to the graph.\n\u2022 If x \u2212 v is an edge for some v \u2208 V1 , then by Theorem 3.1, x \u2212 w is an edge for\nsome w \u2208 V2 \u222a V3 . If w \u2208 V2 , then \u0393(S) contains C4,5 as an induced subgraph,\nand if w \u2208 V3 , then \u0393(S) contains C4,4 as an induced subgraph. Both conclusions\ncontradict Lemma 5.3.\n\u25b3(\u03c1 +1,\u03c12 ,\u03c13 )\n,\n\u2022 If deg(x) = 1 and x is a neighbour of a, d or e, then we get K \u03bc,\u03bd 1\n\u25b3(\u03c1 ,\u03c1 +1,\u03c1 )\n\n\u25b3(\u03c1 ,\u03c1 ,\u03c1 +1)\n\n3\nor K \u03bc,\u03bd 1 2 3 , respectively.\nK \u03bc,\u03bd 1 2\n\u2022 If deg(x) = 1 and x is not a neighbour of a, d and e, let us assume without loss\nof generality that x \u2212 v is an edge for some v \u2208 V2 \\{a, d}. Since deg(x) = 1, then\nxa 6= 0 and (xa)y = (xa)v = (xa)e = 0 for all y \u2208 V3 , and this contradicts the\nassumption that \u0393(S) has exactly one 3-cycle.\n\u2022 If deg(x) \u2265 2 and w \u2212 x \u2212 v is a path, then v, w \u2208 V2 or v, w \u2208 V3 . (Otherwise,\nwe obtain a new 3-cycle in \u0393(S) if w \u2208 V2 and v \u2208 V3 or if w and v are two\nvertices of the 3-cycle a \u2212 e \u2212 d \u2212 a, and we obtain C4,4 if one of v, w is equal\nto e.) Say, v, w \u2208 V2 . Suppose there exists u \u2208 V2 such that xu 6= 0. Now,\n(xu)y = (xu)w = (xu)v = 0 for all y \u2208 V3 , and this contradicts the assumption\nthat \u0393(S) has exactly one 3-cycle. Thus, x \u2212 u is an edge in \u0393(S) for all u \u2208 V2 ,\n\u25b3(\u03c11 ,\u03c12 ,\u03c13 )\n\u25b3(\u03c11 ,\u03c12 ,\u03c13 )\n. Similarly, if v, w \u2208 V3 , we get K \u03bc+1,\u03bd\n.\nso we get K \u03bc,\u03bd+1\nIf the only cycle in \u0393(S) is the 3-cycle, then all other vertices in \u0393(S) are at distance 1\nfrom the triangle. Otherwise, if a \u2212 b \u2212 e \u2212 a \u2212 x \u2212 y is a subgraph of \u0393(S), but then xb 6= 0\nand (xb)a = (xb)e = (xb)y = 0 which is a contradiction, since we obtain a new 3-cycle in\n\u0393(S).\n\u0004\n\n11\n\n\fCorollary 7.2. If S is a commutative semiring with the only cycle of \u0393(S) being a 3-cycle,\n\u25b3(r ,r ,r )\nthen \u0393(S) = K1,1 1 2 3 .\nThe following example shows that there exist commutative semirings with their zero\u2013\n\u25b3(r ,r ,r )\ndivisor graphs equal to K1,1 1 2 3 for all r1 , r2 , r3 \u2265 1.\nExample 7.3. Let us denote by ei the element in B r1 +r2 +r3 , which has its only nonzero\nentry in the i-th position and fj the element in B r1 +r2 +r3 , which has its only zero entry\nin the j-th position. Let us define elements\nrP\n1 \u22121\nai = f i\net + er1 +r2 + er1 +r2 +r3\nfor all i = 1, 2, . . . , r1 \u2212 1,\nt=1\nrP\n2 \u22121\n\nbj = fr1 +j\n\ner1 +t\nt=1\nrP\n3 \u22121\n\ncl = fr1 +r2 +l\n\n+ er1 + er1 +r2 +r3\n\nfor all j = 1, 2, . . . , r2 \u2212 1,\n\ner1 +r2 +t + er1 + er1 +r2 for all l = 1, 2, . . . , r3 \u2212 1.\n\nt=1\n\nDenote by S the semiring, generated by\nZ = {er1 , er1 +r2 , er1 +r2 +r3 , ai , bj , cl ;\n= 1, 2, . . . , r1 \u2212 1, j = 1, 2, . . . , r2 \u2212 1, l = 1, 2, . . . , r3 \u2212 1}\nand note that Z(S)\u2217 = Z. Clearly,\ner1 \u2212 ai\ner1 \u2212 (er1 +r2 + er1 +r2 +r3 )\ner1 +r2 \u2212 bj\ner1 +r2 \u2212 (er1 + er1 +r2 +r3 )\ner1 +r2 +r3 \u2212 cl\ner1 +r2 +r3 \u2212 (er1 + er1 +r2 )\nare edges in \u0393(S) for all i = 1, 2, . . . , r1 \u2212 1, j = 1, 2, . . . , r2 \u2212 1 and l = 1, 2, . . . , r3 \u2212 1,\n\u25b3(r ,r ,r )\nand er1 \u2212 er1 +r2 \u2212 er1 +r2 +r3 \u2212 er1 form a 3-cycle. Thus, \u0393(S) = K1,1 1 2 3 .\n\u0003\nRecall that we proved in Lemma 5.1 that all zero\u2013divisor graphs containing exactly\none 3-cycle and at least one k-cycle, k \u2265 4, also contain C4,3 as an induced subgraph.\nThe following technical lemma will give us some algebraic properties on the elements,\ncorresponding to the vertices of C4,3 . It will enable us to prove that in this case \u0393(S) =\n\u25b3(r ,r ,0)\nKm,n 1 2 where r1 , r2 \u2265 1, m, n \u2265 2.\nLemma 7.4. Suppose S is a commutative semiring, \u0393(S) contains exactly one 3-cycle\nand at least one k-cycle, k \u2265 4. Let us denote by a \u2212 b \u2212 c \u2212 d \u2212 a \u2212 e \u2212 b \u2212 a its induced\nsubgraph and let a \u2212 f be an edge in \u0393(S) and deg f = 1. Then,\n(1) a2 = b2 = e2 = 0,\n(2) ac = ec = f c = a,\n(3) bd = ed = b,\n(4) a + b = e.\nMoreover, if S is additively cancellative, then\n(5) 2a = 2b = 2e = 0,\n(6) b + e = a and a + e = b.\n12\n\n\fProof. Firstly, let us note that ec 6= 0 and (ec)a = (ec)b = (ec)d = 0, and since \u0393(S)\ncontains only one 3-cycle, we have ec = a. Similarly we prove that ac = f c = a and\nbd = ed = b.\nConsider now the element a2 . Since a2 e = a2 b = 0, and a2 6= b (otherwise bd = a2 d = 0),\n2\na 6= e (otherwise be = a2 e = 0), a2 6= a (otherwise a2 = aa = aec = 0), it follows that\na2 = 0. Similarly we prove that b2 = 0.\nNow, let us observe that (a + b)a = (a + b)b = (a + b)e = 0. Note that a + b 6= 0\n(otherwise, bd = (a + b)d = 0), a + b 6= a (otherwise, bd = (a + b)d = ad = 0), a + b 6= b\n(otherwise, ac = (a + b)c = bc = 0), and since \u0393(S) contains only one 3-cycle, we have\na + b = e and therefore also e2 = a2 + b2 + 2ab = 0.\nSuppose now, S is additively cancellative. Then, 2a 6= a and (2a)b = (2a)e = (2a)d = 0,\nthus 2a = 0. Similarly, 2b = 0 and therefore also 2e = 2(a + b) = 0. Now, it follows that\na = a + b + b = e + b and b = b + a + a = e + a.\n\u0004\n\nTheorem 7.5. If S is a commutative semiring and \u0393(S) contains exactly one 3-cycle and\n\u25b3(r ,r ,0)\nat least one k-cycle, k \u2265 4, then \u0393(S) = Km,n 1 2 and r1 , r2 \u2265 1, m, n \u2265 2.\nProof. If \u0393(S) contains a k-cycle for some k \u2265 4 then it also contains C4,3 , a\u2212b\u2212c\u2212d\u2212a\u2212\n\u25b3(r ,r ,r )\ne \u2212 b \u2212 a as an induced subgraph by Lemma 5.1. By Proposition 7.1, \u0393(S) = Km,n 1 2 3\nand let ai , bj , el \u2208 S such that deg(ai ) = deg(bj ) = deg(el ) = 1 and a \u2212 ai , b \u2212 bj , e \u2212 el\nare edges in \u0393(S) for i = 1, 2, . . . , r1 , j = 1, 2, . . . , r2 and l = 1, 2, . . . , r3 .\nNow, let us prove that r1 \u2265 1. Consider the sum d + e and observe that d + e 6= 0.\nNamely, if d + e = 0, we would have ec = (e + d)c = 0. Since (e + d)a = 0, we have\nfew possibilities for e + d. Because e + d 6= a (otherwise db = (d + e)b = ab = 0),\ne + d 6= b (otherwise db = (d + e)b = b2 = 0 by Lemma 7.4 (1)), e + d 6= e (otherwise\ndb = (d + e)b = eb = 0) and c(d + e) 6= 0 (otherwise a = ce = c(d + e) = 0), it follows\nthat d + e = ai for some i. Similarly, we prove that e + c = bj for some j and therefore\nr1 , r2 \u2265 1.\nAssume r3 \u2265 1 and consider an element ael 6= 0. We have (ael )b = (ael )e = (ael )d =\n(ael )ai = 0 and since \u0393(S) contains only one 3-cycle, we have ael = a. Similarly we prove\nthat bel = b. Now, by Lemma 7.4 (4) we have that e = a + b = ael + bel = (a + b)el =\n\u25b3(r ,r ,0)\neel = 0, which is a contradiction. Thus, r3 = 0 and \u0393(S) = Km,n 1 2 .\n\u0004\n\nCorollary 7.6. If S is an additively cancellative commutative semiring and \u0393(S) contains\n\u25b3(n\u22121,m\u22121,0)\nexactly one 3-cycle and at least one k-cycle, k \u2265 4, then \u0393(S) = Km,n\nwith\nm, n \u2265 2.\nProof. By Theorem 7.5 we know that m, n \u2265 2, and denote (as in the proof of the same\ntheorem) by a\u2212b\u2212cj \u2212di \u2212a\u2212e\u2212b\u2212a the induced subgraph of \u0393(S), let d1 , d2 , . . . , dn\u22121 , b\nand c1 , c2 , . . . , cm\u22121 , a be the partition of vertices of an induced complete bipartite subgraph of \u0393(S). By Lemma 7.4 (1) we have that e2 = 0 and therefore (di + e)a = 0,\n(di + e)e 6= 0, (di + e)b 6= 0 and (di + e)cj 6= 0 for all i = 1, 2, . . . , n \u2212 1. Therefore,\ndeg(di + e) = 1 and (di + e) \u2212 a is an edge in \u0393(S). Since di + e 6= dj + e for i 6= j, it\nfollows that r1 \u2265 n \u2212 1. Similarly, we can see r2 \u2265 m \u2212 1.\n13\n\n\fLet a\u2212f be an edge in \u0393(S) and deg f = 1. Using Lemma 7.4, observe that (f +a)a = 0,\n(f + a)ci = f c + aci = a + a = 0 and (f + a)e 6= 0 and thus f + a = dj for some j. Now,\ndj + b = f + a + b = f + e and since (dj + b)a = (dj + b)ci = 0 for all i and S is additively\ncancellative, it follows that dk = dj + b = f + e. By adding e it follows that dk + e = f ,\nwhich proves that r1 = n \u2212 1. Similarly, r2 = m \u2212 1.\n\u0004\nEvery additively cancellative semiring can be embedded into a ring of differences (see for\nexample [20, Thm. 5. 11]), but in case the zero\u2013divisor graph of the additively cancellative\nsemiring contains exactly one 3-cycle, we can prove that the semiring actually has to be a\nring. We will then study the zero\u2013divisor graphs of rings in the next section.\nProposition 7.7. If S is a commutative additively cancellative semiring and \u0393(S) contains exactly one 3-cycle, then S is a ring.\nProof. Denote the only 3-cycle in \u0393(S) by a \u2212 b \u2212 e \u2212 a. Now (2a)b = (2a)e = 0, so\n2a \u2208 Z(S) and 2a \u2208 {0, b, e}, since 2a = a implies that a = 0. Similarly, we can show\nthat 3a \u2208 {0, b, e} and 4a \u2208 {0, b, e}. So, either at least one of 2a, 3a, 4a is equal to zero\nor at least two of 2a, 3a, 4a coincide. Since S is additively cancellative, it follows that\nin all cases there exists an integer n > 0 such that na = 0. Similarly, we can also show\nthat mb = re = 0 for some integers m, r > 0. This implies that (nm)a = (mn)b = 0, so\nnm \u2208 Z(S) and nm \u2208 {0, a, b, e}. In each case we get that N = 0 for some integer N > 0,\nso for every x \u2208 S we have \u2212x = (N \u2212 1)x \u2208 S, therefore S is a ring.\n\u0004\nThe following example shows that in case S is not additively cancellative, the zero\u2013\n\u25b3(r ,r ,0)\ndivisor graph \u0393(S) = Km,n 1 2 need not have r1 = n \u2212 1 and r2 = m \u2212 1.\nExample 7.8. Let S \u2286 M2 (B) \u00d7 M2 (B) \u00d7 M2 (B) be a commutative semiring, generated\nby\na = (J2 , 0, 0)\nb = (0, 0, J2 )\nc = (I2 + J2 , 0, 0)\nd = (0, 0, I2 + J2 )\nf = (J2 , J2 , I2 + J2 )\n1 = (I2 , I2 , I2 )\n\u25b3(2,1,0)\n\nObserve that Z(S)\u2217 = {a, b, c, d, a + b, f, a + d, b + c} and that \u0393(S) = K2,2\n\n.\n\n\u0003\n\n8. Commutative rings having zero\u2013divisor graphs with one 3-cycle\nWe now know the types of graphs that can appear as the zero\u2013divisor graphs of semirings. However, the setting appears to be too general to allow for a classification of the\nstructure of semirings that have these types of zero divisor graphs. We will characterize\nall commutative rings (with identity), such that their zero divisor graphs contain exactly\none 3-cycle.\nFor an arbitrary ring R, let T2 (R) denote the ring of all matrices of the form aI2 + bJ2 ,\nwhere a, b \u2208 R.\n14\n\n\fLemma 8.1. If S = S1 \u00d7 S2 is an additively cancellative commutative semiring such\nthat \u0393(S) contains exactly one 3-cycle, then S1 , S2 \u2208 {Z4 , T2 (Z2 )} are rings and \u0393(S) =\n\u25b3(2,2,0)\nK3,3\n.\nProof. Suppose firstly that all 3 vertices (x1 , y1 ), (x2 , y2 ), (x3 , y3 ) on the 3-cycle have one\ncomponent equal to 0. Since \u0393(S) contains exactly one 3-cycle, it follows that at least\none of x1 , x2 , x3 is nonzero and at least one of y1 , y2 , y3 is nonzero. So, let us assume that\n(a, 0) \u2212 (b, 0) \u2212 (0, c) \u2212 (a, 0) is a 3-cycle. If a2 = 0, then (a, 0) \u2212 (a, c) \u2212 (b, 0) \u2212 (a, 0) is\nanother 3-cycle in the graph and if a2 6= 0, then (b, 0) \u2212 (a2 , 0) \u2212 (0, c) \u2212 (b, 0) is another\n3-cycle in the graph, contradiction.\nLet (a, b), (a2 , b2 ) and (a3 , b3 ) be the vertices on the 3-cycle and suppose that a, b 6= 0.\nSince (a, 0) and (0, b) are also zero divisors, we have {(a2 , b2 ), (a3 , b3 )} = {(a, 0), (0, b)}\nand a2 = b2 = 0. If there exists x \u2208 Z(S1 ), x \u2208\n/ {0, a}, then xy = 0 for some y \u2208 Z(S1 )\u2217 , so\neither (x, 0)\u2212(y, 0)\u2212(0, b)\u2212(x, 0) is another 3-cycle (if x 6= y) or (x, 0)\u2212(x, b)\u2212(0, b)\u2212(x, 0)\nis another 3-cycle (if x = y). Thus, Z(S1 ) = {0, a} and Z(S2 ) = {0, b}. Since 2a \u2208 Z(S1 )\nand S1 is additively cancellative, it follows that 2a = 0. Now, choose an x \u2208 S1 \\Z(S1 ).\nNote that xa \u2208 Z(S1 ) implies xa = a. Since (2x)a = 0, it follows that 2x = 0 or 2x = a.\nAlso, (x + 1)a = 0, so either x + 1 = 0 or x + 1 = a. By adding either x or x + a\nto these equations, we can conclude that x = 1 or x = 1 + a. Thus we proved that\nS1 = {0, 1, a, 1 + a}. Since a2 = 2a = 0 and we either have 1 + 1 = 0 or 1 + 1 = a, it\nfollows that either S1 \u2243 T2 (Z2 ) (via mapping 1 7\u2192 I2 , a 7\u2192 E1,2 ) or S1 \u2243 Z4 . Similarly, we\nshow that S2 \u2208 {Z4 , T2 (Z2 )}.\n\u0004\nIn the case S is a ring, the following Proposition shows that the assumption that S is\na direct product is actually superfluous.\nProposition 8.2. Let R be a commutative ring with identity such that \u0393(R) contains\nexactly one 3-cycle and at least one k-cycle, k \u2265 4, then R is isomorphic to a direct\n\u25b3(2,2,0)\nproduct R1 \u00d7 R2 , where R1 , R2 \u2208 {Z4 , T2 (Z2 )} and \u0393(R) = K3,3\n.\n\u25b3(n\u22121,m\u22121,0)\n\nProof. By Corollary 7.6 it follows that \u0393(R) = Km,n\nwith m, n \u2265 2. Denote by\na \u2212 b \u2212 ci \u2212 dj \u2212 a \u2212 e \u2212 b \u2212 a the induced subgraph of \u0393(R) where d1 , d2 , . . . , dn\u22121 , b and\nc1 , c2 , . . . , cm\u22121 , a is the partition of vertices of an induced complete bipartite subgraph of\n\u0393(R).\nBy Lemma 7.4 we know that eci = a and therefore (ci \u2212cj )e = (ci \u2212cj )b = (ci \u2212cj )dk = 0\nfor all i, j, k. Thus ci \u2212 cj = a for all i 6= j and m, n \u2264 3.\nObserve that (b + ci )b = 0 and c2i 6= 0, because c2i = 0 yields (b + ci )ci = 0 and since\nb+ci 6= 0, b+ci 6= b, b+ci 6= ci and b+ci 6= dj (otherwise, aci = a(b+ci ) = adj = 0), we get\na contradiction. Since ci cj = a together with Lemma 7.4 implies that ci a = ci cj e = ae = 0,\nit follows that ci cj = ck for some k. If m = 2, then c21 = c1 . Suppose that m = 3 and\nassume without loss of generality that c1 c2 = c1 . If c2 is not idempotent, i.e., c22 = c1 , it\nfollows that c21 = c1 c22 = c1 c2 = c1 and therefore c1 is idempotent. We proved that R in\nall cases contains an idempotent c. Then, 1 = c + (1 \u2212 c) is an orthogonal decomposition\nof identity, thus R \u2243 Rc \u00d7 R(1 \u2212 c). Now, the proposition follows by Lemma 8.1.\n\u0004\n15\n\n\fIt remains for us to investigate the zero\u2013divisor graphs with girth equal to 3, containing\nexactly one cycle.\nLemma 8.3. If R is a commutative ring with identity and \u0393(R) = K3 , then R is isomorphic to one of the following rings: T2 (GF (4)), Z4 [x]/(x2 + x + 1), Z2 [x, y]/(x2 , xy, y 2 ), or\nZ4 [x]/(2x, x2 ).\nProof. If \u0393(R) = K3 , then let Z(R) = {0, a, b, e}. Suppose there exists f \u2208 R such\nthat f a = b or f a = e. Without loss of generality, we can assume that f a = b. Then\n(f + 1)a = b + a and a + b \u2208 Z(R). If a + b = e, then aR = Z(R). Otherwise, since R\nis a ring, a + b \u2208\n/ {a, b}, so a + b = 0. Then b = \u2212a, and (1 \u2212 f )a = a \u2212 b = 2a \u2208 Z(R).\nNote that 2a = 0 implies that b = \u2212a = a and 2a = a implies that a = 0. So, consider\nthe case 2a = b = \u2212a. Since a + e \u2208 Z(R) and is obviously not equal to 0, a, e, we have\na + e = b = \u2212a and thus e = \u22122a = a, s contradiction. Therefore, 2a = e and again\naR = Z(R).\nSince R-module Ra is isomorphic to R R/Ann(a), and Ann(a) = Z(R), we have that\n|R| = 16. By [23, Thm. 12] it follows that R \u2243 T2 (GF (4)), R \u2243 Z4 [x]/(x2 + x + 1).\nIn the remaining case we have that f a = a therefore (1 \u2212 f )a = 0 for all f \u2208 R\\Z(R).\nWe thus have 1 \u2212 f \u2208 Z(R) and therefore R = {0, 1, a, b, e, 1 + a, 1 + b, 1 + e}. Since the\nset of zero divisors is closed under addition, R is a local ring of order 8. By [15, p. 687],\nR is one of the following:\n\u2022 GF (8), which has no nontrivial zero\u2013divisors,\n\u2022 Z2 [x]/(x3 ), but \u0393(R) = P3 ,\n\u2022 Z2 [x, y]/(x2 , xy, y 2 ), which gives us \u0393(R) = K3 ,\n\u2022 Z4 [x]/(2x, x2 \u2212 2), but \u0393(R) = P3 ,\n\u2022 Z4 [x]/(2x, x2 ), which gives us \u0393(R) = K3 ,\n\u2022 Z8 , but \u0393(R) = P3 .\nThus the Lemma follows.\n\u0004\nWe are now in a position to characterize all rings such that their zero\u2013divisor graphs\ncontain exactly one 3-cycle.\nTheorem 8.4. If R is a commutative ring with identity and \u0393(R) contains exactly one\n3-cycle, then exactly one of the following statements holds:\n(1) R is isomorphic to a direct product R1 \u00d7 R2 , where R1 , R2 \u2208 {Z4 , T2 (Z2 )} and\n\u25b3(2,2,0)\n\u0393(R) = K3,3\n,\n(2) R \u2243 T2 (GF (4))), R \u2243 Z4 [x]/(x2 + x + 1), R \u2243 Z2 [x, y]/(x2 , xy, y 2 ), or R \u2243\n\u25b3(0,0,0)\nZ4 [x]/(2x, x2 ), and \u0393(R) = K3 = K1,1\n,\n\u25b3(4,0,0)\n\n(3) R \u2243 Z16 or R \u2243 Z2 [x]/(x4 ) and \u0393(R) = K1,1\n\n.\n\nProof. If \u0393(R) apart from the 3-cycle also contains an n-cycle for some n \u2265 4, then\nProposition 8.2 implies (1) and if \u0393(R) = K3 , then Lemma 8.3 implies (2).\n\u25b3(r ,r ,r )\nBy Proposition 7.1 the only remaining case is \u0393(R) = K1,1 1 2 3 , and let a \u2212 b \u2212 e \u2212 a\ndenote the 3-cycle and let ai , bj , el \u2208 S such that deg(ai ) = deg(bj ) = deg(el ) = 1 and\n16\n\n\fa\u2212ai , b\u2212bj , e\u2212el are edges in \u0393(S) for i = 1, 2, . . . , r1 , j = 1, 2, . . . , r2 and l = 1, 2, . . . , r3 .\nNote that ((1 + bj )a)b = ((1 + bj )a)e = ((1 + bj )a)ai = 0. This yields (1 + bj )a = 0, since\n(1 + bj )a = a implies that bj a = 0.\nIf r1 , r2 , r3 > 0 then note that bj e = e and then (1 + bj )e = e + e = 2e = 0, since\n(2e)a = (2e)b = (2e)el = 0 and 2e 6= e. Since (1 + bj )b 6= 0, we have 1 + bj = b. By\nmultiplying this equation with b, we obtain b2 = b and this gives us a contradiction by\nLemma 8.1. Therefore r3 = 0.\nNow, we shall prove that also r2 = 0. Since the left R-module Re is isomorphic to the\nquotient module R/Ann(e), and both Re and Ann(e) have at most 4 elements (0, e, a, b),\nwe know that R is a ring of at most 16 elements. We also know that R is a directly\nindecomposable ring by Lemma 8.1, therefore it contains no non-trivial idempotents. Thus,\nby [22, Theorem VII.7] R is a local ring and the set of zero divisors Z(R) is the Jacobson\nradical of R. Assume that r2 > 0. Similarly as above, we can see that (1 + bj )a 6= a, so\n(1 + bj )a = 0 and thus 1 + bj is a zero divisor. Since bj is a zero divisor as well, we have\nthat 1 = 1 + bj + (\u2212bj ) is a zero divisor, which gives us a contradiction.\n\u25b3(r ,0,0)\nTherefore, \u0393(R) = K1,1 1\nand we can assume that r1 > 0. Note that (a2 )ai =\n2\n2\n2\n(a )b = (a )e = 0, so a = 0 since there are no non-trivial idempotents in R. Then for\neach ai such that ai a = 0 we also obtain (ai + a)a = (ai + b)a = (ai + e)a = 0. Observe\nthat ai + a, ai + b, ai + e \u2208\n/ {0, a, e, b}: for example, if ai + b = a then ai e = 0; if ai + b = e\nthen since (a + b)a = (a + b)e = 0, it follows that a + b = e, and therefore ai = a. Similarly,\nwe treat other cases.\nTherefore r1 \u2265 4 and thus |Z(R)| \u2265 8. Since Z(R) 6= R this implies that |R| = 16.\nNow, all rings of order 16 are listed in [15, pages 687\u2013690], and we can check which ones\nare commutative rings such that their zero\u2013divisor graph only has one 3-cycle. Among\nthe rings of characteristic 2, the only suitable ring is Z2 [x]/(x4 ), since all 3 commutative\nrings in [15, page 687, case 1.2] have J 2 = {0, a} and the generators x1 , x2 , a of J give us\nan additional 3-cycle, either a \u2212 x1 \u2212 x2 \u2212 a in case x1 x2 = 0, or a \u2212 ai \u2212 a + ai \u2212 a in case\nx21 = x22 = 0. Similarly, we can deal with the [15, page 689, case 2.2.a], which proves that\nthere are no such rings of characteristic 4. It is easy to check all the remaining cases to\nsee that the only other ring that can occur is the ring Z16 .\n\u0004\n\nReferences\n[1] S. Akbari, A.
