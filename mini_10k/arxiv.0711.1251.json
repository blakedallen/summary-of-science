Elementary excitations are supposed to be quasi-electrons\nor quasi-holes with fractional charge1 . The situation becomes more complicated for the systems of finite size.\nCollective gapless excitation modes are predicted to exist at the FQHE edge2 . The structure of the edge modes\nfollows the structure of the ground state: there should\nbe several excitation branches for the bulk filling factors\n\u03bd that are not of the principal Laughlin sequence2,3 .\nThe experimental situation is even more complicated:\nit was shown for integer4 and fractional5,6,7 quantum Hall\neffect regimes, that there is a structure of strips of compressible and incompressible electron liquid at the sample edge. For the FQHE regime, the strips structure\nemerges8,9 if the edge potential variation is wider than\n5-6 magnetic lengths, i.e., for most of real edge potentials. Every incompressible strip can be characterized\nby a local filling factor \u03bdc < \u03bd, which corresponds to\nthe integer or fractional quantum Hall state. The number of strips with integer \u03bdc equals to the number of the\nfilled energy levels in the bulk. The number of the strips\nwith fractional \u03bdc is determined by the FQHE hierarchical structure10 , magnetic field and the sample quality.\nGapless collective modes are predicted8 at the edges of\nthe every incompressible strip with fractional local filling\nfactor. Physically, they can be understood as oscillations\nof the strip's shape across the sample edge. Like in the\nsimplest case of a sharp edge profile, there should be several excitation branches for strips with \u03bdc that are not of\nthe principal Laughlin sequence.\nIt is well known that electron transport across the edge\nis the most appropriate tool for the investigation of the\nedge excitations structure11,12,13 . However, for narrow\nfractional incompressible strips, it gives rise the simultaneous excitation of edge modes from different strips13 .\n\nThe influence of several excitation branches at some fractional \u03bdc can hardly be separated in this case. To avoid\nthis difficuty, samples can be used that have only integer incompressible strips at the edge and FQHE state in\nthe bulk. The easiest way to realize the proposed situation is to use samples of moderate mobility at bulk\nfilling factors \u03bd = 5/3, 4/3. Only \u03bdc = 1 < \u03bd integer\nincompressible strip can exist at the edge in this case.\nThe potential jump in the integer incompressible strip\ncan be completely eliminated by applying high potential\nimbalance across it in suitably designed experimental geometry14 . Thus, transport at higher imbalances could be\nexpected to be sensitive only to the collective edge excitation structure of the bulk fractional state. The edge\nexcitation structure for \u03bd = 5/3, 4/3 should consist of\nseveral excitation branches3 .\nHere, we experimentally study equilibration across the\ninteger incompressible strip with local filling factor \u03bdc = 1\nat the sample edge at high imbalances. The bulk is in the\nquantum Hall state with integer (\u03bd = 2, 3) or high fractional (\u03bd = 5/3, 4/3) filling factors. For the fractional\nones we find a lack of the full equilibration across the\nedge even in the flat-band situation, where no potential\nbarrier survives at the sample edge. We interpret this\nresult as the manifestation of complicated edge excitation structure at high fractional filling factors. Also, a\nmobility gap in \u03bdc = 1 quantum Hall state is determined\nin normal and tilted magnetic fields.\n\nII.\n\nSAMPLES AND TECHNIQUE\n\nThe samples are fabricated from two GaAs/AlGaAs\nheterostructures with different carrier concentrations and\nmobilities, grown by molecular beam epitaxy. One of\nthem (A) contains a 2DEG located 210 nm below the surface. The mobility at 4K is 1.93 *106 cm2 /Vs and the carrier density 1.61 *1011 cm\u22122 , as was obtained from standart magnetoresistance measurements. For heterostruc-\n\n\f2\n\nFIG. 1: Schematic diagram of the active sample area. The\netched mesa edges are shown by solid lines, the dashed lines\nrepresent the split-gate edges. The gate-gap region at the\nouter mesa edge is denoted as AB. Light gray areas are the\nincompressible regions at filling factors \u03bd (in the bulk) and\n\u03bdc = g < \u03bd (under the gate and the incompressible strip at\nthe mesa edge). Compressible regions (white) are at the electrochemical potentials of the corresponding ohmic contacts,\ndenoted by bars with numbers.\n\nture B the corresponding parameters are 70 nm, 800 000\ncm2 /Vs and 3.7 *1011 cm\u22122 . Because of its high carrier\nconcentration, wafer B is used to compare results for integer filling factors at much higher magnetic fields. FQHE\nstates are not achievable for this wafer.\nThe samples are patterned in the quasi-Corbino sample geometry14 . Each sample has an etched region inside, providing a topologically independent inner mesa\nedge (Corbino toipology). A split-gate is used to connect these two edges in a controllable way (see Fig. 1).\nAt bulk filling factor \u03bd a structure of compressible and\nincompressible strips is present at every edge, see Fig. 1.\nAn incompressible quantum Hall state under the gate\n(filling factor g < \u03bd) is chosen to contact one of the incompressible strips at the outer mesa edge (with local\nfilling factor \u03bdc = g). In these conditions, some of the\ncompressible strips (white in Fig. 1) are redirected from\ninner to outer mesa edge along the split-gate. Compressible strips are originally at the electrochemical potentials\nof the corresponding ohmic contacts. The gap in the\nsplit-gate at the outer edge (the gate-gap region, denoted\nas AB in the figure) has no ohmic contacts inside and is\nmuch narrower (LAB = 5\u03bcm in the present experiment)\nthan at the inner one. Both the macroscopic size of the\nungated region at the inner mesa edge (\u223c 1mm) and the\nohmic contacts and the ohmic contacts inside it provide\na full equilibration among the compressible strips here.\nAs a result, applying a voltage between ohmic contacts\nat outer and inner edges leads to the electrochemical potential imbalance across the incompressible strip at local\nfilling factor \u03bdc = g at the outer edge, see Figs. 1,2.\n\nFIG. 2: Schematic diagram of the energy levels in the active\nsample area. Solid lines represent the filled states, dashed\nlines are for empty ones. \u2206 is the potential jump in the \u03bdc = 1\nincompressible strip, \u22064/3 is the energy gap in the bulk. Pinning of the Landau sublevels to the Fermi level (shot-dash)\nis shown in the compressible regions at electrochemical potentials \u03bc1 and \u03bc3 . (a) Equilibrium situation \u03bc3 = \u03bc1 if no\nvoltage V applied to ohmic contacts 1 and 3. (b) Flat-band\nconditions for \u2212eV = \u2212eVth = \u03bc1 \u2212 \u03bc3 = \u2212\u2206 (V > 0, e is\nthe absolute value of the electron charge)\n\nMagnetocapacitance measurements were performed to\ncharacterize the electron system under the gate. By lowering the gate voltage, different quantum Hall states are\narising under the gate. The decrease of the electron concentration when approaching the sample edge is a similar\nprocess for a soft edge potential. Thus, in magnetocapacitance we obtain not only gate voltage values, corresponding to integer or fractional filling factors g under\nthe gate, but also verify the structure of incompressible\nstrips at the sample edge. We can confirm in this way,\nthat there is only \u03bdc = 1 incompressible strip for bulk\nfilling factors \u03bd = 2, 5/3, 4/3 and there are two integer\n\u03bdc = 1, 2 strips for \u03bd = 3.\nIn the present paper, the potential imbalance is applied to the outer contacts with respect to the inner ones,\ni.e. across the incompressible strip at local filling factor\n\u03bdc = g = 1 in the gate-gap, see Fig. 2. The transport\ntakes place across the edge between two spin-split sublevels of the lowest Landau level. They are forming the\nbulk incompressible state, which is integer (for \u03bd = 3, 2)\nor fractional (for \u03bd = 5/3, 4/3). The latter situation is\ndemonstrated in Fig. 2 (a). The potential jump at \u03bdc = 1\nis decreasing14 for positive bias, allowing the flat-band\nsituation at eV = eVth = \u2206 (see Fig. 2 (b)) with easy\nelectron transport across the incompressible strip. For\nV > Vth , full equilibration is expected14 , leading to a\nlinear I \u2212 V -characteristic. The corresponding resistance\nslope Req can easily be calculated5,16 . At negative voltages the potential profile at \u03bdc = 1 is distorted, giving\nrise to the complicated tunnel branch of the I \u2212 V curve.\n\n\f3\n\u03bd=4/3 g=1\n\n5\nV (mV)\n\n15\n15\n\n0\n\n4\n-100\n\n0\nI (nA)\n\nR (h/e2)\n\nV (mV)\n\n-15\n100\n\nVth\n0\n\n0\n\n3\n\n\u03bd=2 g=1\n\u03bd=3 g=1\n\n2\n\n\u03bd=3 g=2\n\n100\n\nI (nA)\n\n1\n\nFIG. 3: The positive branch of the I \u2212 V curve for the filling\nfactor combination \u03bd = 4/3, g = 1 (solid curve).

The threshold voltage Vth is determined from the extrapolation to zero\ncurrent.

The linearity of the positive branch of\nthe experimental I \u2212 V curves themselves exclude the\npossibility of Corbino-type or non-linear contacts. Furthermore, the contact behavior is tested separately by\n2-point magnetoresistance measurements. All measurements are performed in a dilution refrigerator with base\ntemperature 30 mK, equipped with a superconducting\nsolenoid. The results, presented here, are independent of\nthe cooling cycle.\nIII.\n\n\u03bd=5/3 g=1\n\nEXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\n\nA typical I \u2212 V curve for transport across the integer\nincompressible strip is presented in the inset to Fig. 3.\nIt is strongly non-linear and asymmetric: the positive\nbranch starts from the finite threshold voltage Vth and\nis linear after the threshold; the negative branch continuously goes from zero and is strongly non-linear. This\npicture is always valid in the framework of the present\npaper, i.e. for transport across the integer \u03bdc = g incompressible strip for both integer and fractional filling\nfactors in the bulk.

Filling factor combinations are: \u03bd = 3, g = 2 (down triangles,\nB\u22a5 = 2.38 T), \u03bd = 3, g = 1 (up triangles, B\u22a5 = 2.38 T),\n\u03bd = 2, g = 1 (circles, B\u22a5 = 3.58 T), \u03bd = 5/3, g = 1 (squares,\nB\u22a5 = 4.29 T), \u03bd = 4/3, g = 1 (diamonds, B\u22a5 = 5.36 T).\nFilled symbols are for the wafer B. Normal magnetic field\ncomponents are B\u22a5 = 5.18 T for \u03bd = 3, 7.69 T for \u03bd = 2.\nLines indicate the calculated slopes for the case of full equilibration: solid line is for \u03bd = 3, g = 2 and \u03bd = 3, g = 1, dash\nis for \u03bd = 2, g = 1, dotted one is for \u03bd = 5/3, g = 1, dash-dot\nis for \u03bd = 4/3, g = 1.\n\nbranch above the threshold is demonstrated in a wide\nvoltage range in the main field of Fig. 3. A linear fit allows to determine the slope R of the positive branch for\nV > Vth with high accuracy. Also, the threshold voltage Vth can be obtained from the extrapolation to zero\ncurrent.\nExperimental slopes R are presented in Fig. 4 for different integer and fractional filling factor combinations.\nThe data are taken at different tilt angles between the\nmagnetic field and the normal to the sample plane. Each\ndataset is presented as function of the total magnetic\nfield at fixed perpendicular one. Equilibrium slopes, calculated from Eq. (1), are denoted by lines.\nThe experimental R values are independent of the inplane magnetic fields for integer filling factor combinations, see Fig. 4. They coincide with the calculated lines\nvery well, except for the \u03bd = 3, g = 1 fillings. The slope\nof the positive branch for the last one is systematically\nhigher, and is close to one for \u03bd = 2, g = 1. This behavior is also supported by the results for the sample B\n(filled symbols in Fig 4), obtained at much higher normal\nmagnetic fields. We can conclude, that the presented behavior is independent of the magnetic field value and is\nspecific to the filling factors only. The data are temperature independent below 1K.\nThe experimental situation is more intriguing for the\nfractional filling factor combinations \u03bd = 5/3, g = 1 and\n\u03bd = 4/3, g = 1. Slopes of the positive branch are much\nhigher than the calculated values, see Fig 4. This fact\n\n\f4\nis also demonstrated directly in the main part of Fig. 3,\nthere the line with equilibrium slope is depicted. It can\nalso be seen from Fig. 4, that there is a weak dependence\nof R on the in-plane magnetic field. It is different in\nsign for two bulk fractional filling factors \u03bd = 4/3 and\n\u03bd = 5/3 and is more pronounced for the latter one. The\ndata are temperature independent below 0.4 K. At higher\ntemperatures R values are diminishing with increasing\nthe temperature.\nExperimental slopes, exceeding the equilibrium ones,\nindicate partial equilibration for V > Vth . This partial equilibration can not be because of higher magnetic\nfields for fractional fillings, as indicated by good coincidence between the calculation and the experiment for the\nwafer B at twice higher magnetic fields. Also, different\nbehavior for the filling factor combinations \u03bd = 3, g = 1\nand \u03bd = 3, g = 2 shows, that the partial equilibration is\nonly possible in the presence of the some structure at the\nsample edge.\n\nIV.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nLet us start the discussion from the simplest situation\nof \u03bd = 2, g = 1. The only incompressible strip with\n\u03bdc = 1 is present at the edge in this case and the voltage imbalance is applied across it. Equilibration takes\nplace between two spin-split sublevels of the first Landau level15 (see Fig. 2 (a), where the edge structure is\nsimilar to one under discussion). It is well known15,17\nthat the equilibration length leq is determined by both\nthe potential barrier at local filling factor \u03bdc = 1 and\nthe spin-flip rate. This length is about 1 mm at low\nimbalances17 , that provides high differential resistance\n(R \u223c leq /LAB >> Req ) at V < Vth . At high imbalances, for V > 0, the flat-band situation is achieved at\neV = eVth = \u2206c , see Fig. 2 (b). Thus, there is no potential barrier between compressible strips, allowing electron diffusion along the level. Spin-flip can easily be obtained in this case by photon emission15 . The equilibration length drops below LAB = 5 \u03bcm for these reasons13,\nallowing the full equilibration (R = Req ) in our sample.\nThis picture is verified by observation the equilibrium\nslope of the positive I \u2212 V branch for \u03bd = 2, g = 1, see\nFig. 4. We can not expect any influence of the in-plane\nmagnetic field on transport in the flat-band situation, at\nV > Vth , as also confirmed in the present experiment.\nThe situation is more complicated at \u03bd = 3. There are\ntwo incompressible strips at local filling factors \u03bdc = 1, 2.\nVoltage imbalance is applied across one of them, depending on the filling factor g. Potential jump is still survive\nin the other, that prohibits the flat-band situation across\nthe whole sample edge. There should be only flat band\nacross \u03bdc = g incompressible strip at V > Vth . For the\nfilling factor combination \u03bd = 3, g = 1 it is the case: equilibration takes place between two spin-split sublevels of\nthe first Landau level, like for the \u03bd = 2, g = 1 fillings,\nleading to the same experimental slopes (see Fig 4) . For\n\nthe \u03bd = 3, g = 2 fillings the equilibration takes place in\nbetween two spin-split sublevels of different Landau levels, across \u03bdc = 2 incompressible strip. This point is crucial for the equilibration: because of the opposite spin\ncomponent, flowing electrons do not feel the potential\njump in the \u03bdc = 1 incompressible strip, producing the\nfull equilibration across the sample edge, see Fig. 4. The\npartial equilibration, therefore, is a result of some structure of incompressible strips at the edge with \u03bdc 6= g and\nis a sign of such a structure.\nWe can not, however, expect any complicated structure\nof incompressible strips for high fractional filling factors\n\u03bd = 5/3 and \u03bd = 4/3. As it is tested from the magnetocapacitance measurements, there is only one incompressible\nregion with \u03bdc = 1 at the edge. This also is in accordance\nwith our estimations from the sample mobility and the\nmagnetic field. Like in the \u03bd = 2, g = 1 case, equilibration takes place between two spin-split sublevels of the\nfirst Landau level. The bulk state is the incompressible\n\u03bd = 5/3 or 4/3 FQHE state with gapless collective excitation modes at the edge, see Fig. 2. Charge transfer\ninto the edge of the FQHE state is accomplished by their\nexcitation2,8 . Thus, partial equilibration in the flat-band\nconditions (above the threshold) can be achieved only for\ntheir selective (partial) excitation. This partial equilibration is independent of the voltage value, leading to the\nstraight line above the threshold. It can be easily understood: in the flat-band conditions electrons are leaving\nthe fractional incompressible state at the same energy,\nleading to the same excitation schema at any applied\nvoltage. For this reason, our experimental results can be\nregarded as the manifestation of several gapless excitation branches2,8 for these high fractional quantum Hall\nstates.\nThis conclusion is also supported by the small, but\ndifferent dependence of the equilibration on the in-plane\nmagnetic field component: the edge excitation structure\nis different for \u03bd = 5/3 and 4/3. In the first case it consists2,8 of the integer excitation branch and the quasielectron fractional one. For \u03bd = 5/3 it is represented by\nthe two integer branches and the quasi-hole one. Different spin structure of the integer branches in the latter\ncase can be responsible for the more pronounced in-plane\nfield dependence. The more pronounced temperature dependence of R in comparison with integer fillings also indicates that the effect is strongly connected to the bulk\nFQHE state.\nAs it can be easily seen, our experiment allows14 to\ndetermine the energy gap at local filling factor \u03bdc = 1\nby measuring the threshold voltage Vth for g = 1 and\ndifferent (integer or fractional) \u03bd. Even for the bulk system, energy gap behavior at \u03bd = 1 is complicated enough\n(e.g., compare Refs. 18,19). Our results, obtained for the\nincompressible strip at the sample edge, are shown in\nFig. 5 as function of the normal magnetic field at different tilt angles. The experimental values are close to the\nbulk exchange-enhanced gap dependence18 at \u03bd = 1. The\nnormal field dependence is, however, stronger at the edge,\n\n\f5\nWe can try to attribute the in-plane field dependence\nit to Zeeman splitting (like it was done in Refs. 19 for\nthe bulk):\n\n3\n\n2\n\n\u2206 (meV)\n\n\u2206 (meV)\n\n\u03bd=2 g=1\n2\n\u03bd=3 g=1\n1\n0\n1\n\n\u03bd=4/3 g=1\n0\n\n4\nB\u22a5 (T)\n\n8\n\u03bd=5/3 g=1\n\u03bd=2 g=1\n\n\u03bd=3 g=1\n0\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nB\u22a5 (T)\nFIG. 5: Energy gap in the \u03bdc = 1 incompressible strip as\ndetermined from the threshold voltage Vth of I \u2212 V 's for different filling factor combinations. Main figure: \u2206 is presented\nas function of normal magnetic field for the wafer A, for different tilt angles. They are (from down to up): \u03b8 = 0, \u03b8 = 46\u25e6 ,\n\u03b8 = 65.6\u25e6 . Solid line indicates the spin gap dependence for\nthe bulk \u03bd = 1, measured in Ref. 18 from the jump of the\nchemical potential. Inset: Energy gap in the \u03bdc = 1 incompressible strip, determined for the wafer B. Tilt angles are\n\u03b8 = 0, \u03b8 = 31\u25e6 , \u03b8 = 61\u25e6 .\n\nsee Fig. 5. The gap is rising faster than the linear law,\nwhich is very unusual in the bulk. The measured values\nare even higher than the bulk values at the highest magnetic field. Also, a pronounced in-plane field dependence\nis present, see Fig. 5.\nBefore analyzing these results, it is important to understand the nature of the measured gap. We detect the\nsituation eVth = \u2206 as the starting point for the current\nflow. Thus, in the presence of some short-range disorder,\nit is the mobility gap that is measured in our experiment.\nIt is confirmed by the inset to Fig. 5, where the results\nare presented for the low-mobility wafer B. The measured\ngap values are smaller than for the wafer A, despite the\ntwice higher normal magnetic field values. It indicates\nthe influence of the disorder on the gap measurements in\nthis technique.\nCorresponding measurements for the cyclotron gap at\nthe edge (Ref. 14 as well as the present experiment at\n\u03bd = 3, g = 2) always show the cyclotron gap values, approximately 20% smaller than the bulk ones, but with\nthe correct normal and tilted field dependence. Also, the\nmobility edge deformation can hardly produce mobility\ngap values, which are higher than the spectrum ones, as\nwe can see for the high-quality wafer A. Thus, the strong\nfield dependence at \u03bdc = 1 and high gap values can not\nbe ascribed to the change of the mobility edge only. The\ngap itself shoild rise faster at the edge.\n\n\u2206 = \u22060 (B\u22a5 ) + g \u2217 \u03bcB Btot\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u22060 (B\u22a5 ) is the contribution from many-body effects, depends only upon the normal magnetic field B\u22a5\nand the last term is the Zeeman splitting. From our experimental results for the high-quality wafer A, effective\ng-factor g \u2217 varies from 1.4 (in the lowest normal field)\nto 0.7 (in the highest one). Assuming a bare g-factor\n|g| = 0.44 in GaAs, we can conclude that the number of\nspin flips varies from 3 to 1. Thus, the number of spinflips can be higher than one (which is usually attributed\nto skirmion formation) and depends on the normal magnetic field at the sample edge. The field dependence of\nthe spin-flip number was not demonstrated for bulk twodimensional electron systems19 .\nThe above differencies from the bulk systems could be\nbecause of the different symmetry of the \u03bdc = 1 incompressible strip at the sample edge and the bulk at \u03bd = 1.\nHowever, there is still an open question about the possibility to obtain the number of the spin-flips from the\nmobility gap. The high in-plane field dependence for the\nwafer B indicates, that the mobility edge change can be\ncrucial in this case.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn summary, we experimentally study equilibration\nacross the integer incompressible strip with local filling\nfactor \u03bdc = 1 at the sample edge at high imbalances. The\nbulk is in the quantum Hall state with integer (\u03bd = 2, 3)\nor high fractional (\u03bd = 5/3, 4/3) filling factors. For the\nfractional ones we find a lack of the full equilibration\nacross the edge even in the flat-band situation, where no\npotential barrier survives at the sample edge. We interpret this result as the manifestation of complicated\nedge excitation structure at high fractional filling factors. Also, a mobility gap in \u03bdc = 1 quantum Hall state\nis determined in it's dependence on normal and tilted\nmagnetic fields.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe wish to thank V.T.
