What we observe is not the explosion itself but light emitted\nfrom the material of the disrupted white dwarf (WD) for weeks to months afterward. After the first few seconds, this rapidly moving gas expands freely. As a\nconsequence, the matter density decreases with time and the expanding material\nbecomes increasingly transparent, allowing us to see progressively deeper layers.\nThus, a detailed analysis of the observed light curves (the time series of emitted\nflux) and spectra reveals the density and chemical structure of the entire star.\nThe structure of a WD is determined by degenerate electrons and thus largely\nindependent of details such as the temperature or chemical composition. The\nexplosion energy is determined by the binding energy released during the nuclear burning, and the burning products can be observed. The tight relation\nbetween the explosion and the observables and their insensitivity to details are\nthe building blocks on which our understanding of the homogeneity in the observable relations for SNe Ia is based. Indeed, both the peak fluxes and light\ncurve shapes of SNe Ia show an impressive level of homogeneity, making them\nthe astronomical objects closest to a standard candle distance estimator. This\nallows their use for precision estimation of cosmological parameters.\nThe thumbnail sketch of our understanding is as follows:\n\u2022 Type Ia supernovae are nearly homogeneous because nuclear physics determines the structure of white dwarfs, and the explosion.\n\n\f2\n\nPeter H\u00f6flich et al.\n\n\u2022 The total production of nuclear energy is almost constant since very little\nof the WD remains unburned. The final explosion energy depends on the\nbinding energy of the WD, which is given by its structure.\n\u2022 The light curves are powered by the radioactive decay of 56 N i produced\nduring the explosion, independently from details of the explosion physics\nand progenitors. The amount of 56 N i determines the absolute brightness.\n\u2022 The energy released from the nickel decay ties together the luminosity and\nthe temperature dependent opacity, i.e. how much flux is emitted and how\nquickly. Explicitly, less Ni means a lower luminosity, but at the same time\nlower temperature in the gas and so lower opacity. Thus, energy escape is\nmore rapid. So dimmer SN are quicker, i.e. have narrower light curves. This\nis variously called the brightness decline, peak magnitude - light curve width,\nor stretch relation.\n\u2022 To be in agreement with the narrowness of the brightness decline relation\n[66], the mass of the progenitors and the explosion energies must be similar. This is automatically satisfied in the currently most successful model: a\nChandrasekhar mass C/O-WD in which the burning starts off as a deflagration front (propagating at well below the speed of sound) and subsequently\nturns into a detonation (with \u2248 the speed of sound).\n\u2022 To agree with observations of intermediate mass elements at the outer layers,\nthe WD must be pre-expanded. Most likely, an initial deflagration phase\ncauses the pre-expansion. This depends mainly on the amount of energy\nrelease but not on the details of the deflagration front. Within this paradigm,\n1) the entire WD is burned, and 2) the production of 56 N i is dominated by\na single parameter characterizing the transition between deflagration and\ndetonation, determining the amount of burning during the deflagration.\nThe deflagration-detonation model thus gives a natural and well motivated\norigin for a narrow brightness decline relation. In addition, the resulting\nchemical layering is shell like as observed.\n\u2022 Homogeneity can be established down to a level of 0.2 magnitudes. Beyond\nthis, secondary parameters are expected to become important, namely the\nprogenitor mass on the main sequence, its metallicity, and stellar rotation.\nIn particular, the pre-conditioning of the WD prior to the thermonuclear\nrunaway may hold the key to understanding the variety of SNe Ia.\nWith more detailed observations, these characteristics will help to improve\nthe current accuracy of SNe Ia as distance indicators.\nIn the following sections, we address the current status of our understanding\nof SNe in more detail and elaborate on how future observations by ground based\ntelescopes and dedicated space missions, in combination with detailed modeling,\nwill help to bring us to a new level of understanding. These include new insights\ninto the nature of SNe including the progenitors, the thermonuclear runaway\nthat leads to the explosion, the propagation of nuclear burning fronts and their\n3-dimensional nature. These studies will help to discover and understand new\nrelations between observables to get a handle on the relation of SNe Ia with\ntheir environment, including evolutionary effects with redshift, and to improve\nthe accuracy of SNe Ia as cosmological distance indicators.\n\n\fType Ia Supernovae and Cosmology\n\n2\n\n3\n\nA Simplified Explosion Model\n\nThe following scenario summarizes one possibility for the creation and characteristics of a SNe Ia. This is designed solely to give the reader a simple example\nto relate a variety of concepts.\nConsider a white dwarf (WD) in a binary system, accreting mass from its\ncompanion (1). This initial phase ends when the total mass approaches the\nChandrasekhar mass (beyond which the star would collapse to a neutron star or\nblack hole) and causes compressional heating of the core and the thermonuclear\nrunaway. Likely, the burning front starts as a deflagration (velocity well below\nthe sound speed). The energy release lifts the WD in its potential and causes preexpansion of the star needed to reduce the density under which burning occurs.\nAfter a few seconds, the burning fronts makes a transition to a detonation (or\nvery fast deflagration). All material in the high density regions is burned to\n\nFig. 1. Possible scenario for a progenitor system of a SN Ia. A white dwarf accretes\nmaterial from a close companion by Roche lobe overflow. Initially, the WD has a mass\nbetween 0.6 and 1.2 M\u2299 and, by accretion, approaches the Chandrasekhar mass limit.\nThe companion star may be a main sequence star or red giant, or a helium star or\nanother WD. Depending on this, the accreted material may be either H, He or C/O\nrich. If H or He is accreted, nuclear burning on the surface converts it to a C/O\nmixture at an equal ratio in all cases. Despite the different evolutionary pathways, the\nfinal result will be the same: the explosion of a C/O-WD with a mass close to MCh\nand with very similar SN properties. Some small fraction of SNe Ia may also be the\nresult of merging of two WDs on a dynamical time scale.\n\n\f4\n\nPeter H\u00f6flich et al.\n\n56\n\nN i while outer shells of Si, S, etc. and a small fraction of the original C and O\nremain. The specific energy released by these reactions unbinds the material and\ncauses a rapid acceleration of the matter. As the radioactive 56 N i decays, the\nresulting gamma ray energy is thermalized and produces the optical luminosity,\nor light curve (LC), over tens of days to months. The rise time and decay time\nare given by the decay rate and the opacity and expansion. Spectral time series\nmap out the SN structure as the photosphere recedes through the material.\nThe simplified physics picture is as follows: The rate of the free expansion\nis determined by the specific nuclear energy production which, for a C/O-WD,\nis rather insensitive to the burning process and the final burning products. The\ncomplete burning of the white dwarf in the explosion fixes the total nuclear energy release and hence kinetics; the transition density determines the nickel mass\nproduced; the nickel decay fixes the energy input to the supernova material, determining its luminosity and opacity. The opacity and explosion energy together\ngive the shape of the light curve, namely the brightness decline relation.\nAlternate model pathways, in fact, converge to the same major points after\neach stage, driven by the physics and constrained by the observations. Several\nexamples of such \"stellar amnesia\" indemnify the observables against details of\nhow the final state is reached. For example what is predominantly important\nfor the energy production is that the overwhelming majority of the star burns,\nnot how it does because the release of energy by the fusion of C/O up to Si/S\ndominates over the relatively little binding energy in the last stage to iron.\nOn the other hand, the tight relation between the observables evinced by\nthe homogeneity of the brightness-width relation only occurs in certain classes\nof models. This constrains the possibilities, as do such data as infrared spectra showing little unburned original C-O material. Together, amnesia from the\nphysics and empirical data from observations weave a tight net around the possible ingredients that can be important in determining the absolute brightness.\n\n3\n\nPhysics of the Explosion, Light Curves, and Spectra\n\nAs stated in the overview, nuclear physics determines the structure of the progenitor and is responsible for the homogeneity of SNe Ia. As the SN Ia expands,\nwe see deeper layers with time due to the geometrical dilution. The unveiling of\nthe layers reveals the structure of the WD. The observable data provide a rich\nresource for testing and refining models. E.g., the light curves provide critical\ninformation about integrated quantities such as the total energy generation and\nmass and energetics of the expanding material. The spectra are mostly sensitive\nto the composition and velocity at the photosphere (the deepest unveiled layer).\nThe spectra of SNe Ia are dominated by elements (C,O,Si,S,Ca,Fe/Co/Ni)\nthat are the characteristic products of explosive nuclear burning at densities\nbetween 106\u22129 g/cm3 . These densities are typical only for a C/O-WD, i.e. a\nstar stabilized by a degenerate electron gas. For such a degenerate equation of\nstate, the initial structure of the exploding WD depends only weakly on the\ntemperature and the C/O ratio as a function of depth. WD radii are between\n\n\fType Ia Supernovae and Cosmology\n\n5\n\n1500 to 2000 km/sec, mainly depending on density at the time of the accretion\nwhich is mainly given by the accretion rate (see [25] and above). Typical binding\nenergies are \u2248 5 to 6 \u00d7 1050 erg. If the entire WD is burned, about 2 \u00d7 1051 ergs\nare released over time scales of seconds. The energy released is given by the\ndifference between the binding energy per nuclear of unburned compared to\nburned matter. Because the nuclear binding energy of both the of the fuel, i.e.\ncarbon and oxygen, and the final burning product, i.e. Si and Ni, are rather\nsimilar, variations in the specific energy release per mass of burned matter is\nlimited to \u2248 10%. Neutrino losses are less than 1 to 2 % and, thus, little energy\nis lost in contrast to core collapse SNe where more \u2248 99% of the release energy is\nlost by neutrinos. In the explosion, a WD with a radius of about 1500 km expands\nwith observed velocities of the order of 10,000 km/sec, consistent with the specific\nnuclear energy release in such an environment. Because this rapid increase in\nvolume and the adiabatic cooling, the nuclear energy is used to overcome the\nbinding energy and to accelerate the WD matter. Based on this evidence, there\nis general agreement that SNe Ia result from some process of combustion of a\ndegenerate WD. The amount and products of the nuclear reactions \u2013 \"burning\"\n\u2013 depend mainly on the time scale of reactions compared to the hydrodynamical\ntime scale of expansion, which is \u2248 1sec. The reaction rate depends sensitively\non the temperature and the energy release per volume element. The specific\nenergy release is a function of the density and, to a smaller extent, the initial\nchemical composition, namely the C/O ratio of the progenitor (which depends\non the initial stellar mass). At densities \u2265 107 , \u2265 4 \u00d7 106 , and \u2265 106 g/cm3 ,\nthe main burning products are Fe/Co/Ni, S/Si and Mg/O, respectively. We will\nsee, however, that the details of the burning process have little impact. These\nquantities we discussed \u2013 the explosion energy, mass, and the burning product\n\u2013 are directly linked in SNe Ia, and accessible to observations.\nAs just mentioned, virtually none of the initial stored energy from the WD\nwill contribute to the luminosity of the supernova but it goes to expansion.\nInstead, the energy input is entirely caused by the radioactive decay of freshly\nsynthesized 56 N i that decays via 56 N i \u219256 Co \u219256 F e with life times of 8.8\nand \u2248 111 days, respectively. This slow nuclear energy release is due to a gain\nof nuclear binding energy between isotopes rather than change of elements. The\ntotal energy released by radioactive decays is about 3 % of the initial energy\nrelease, namely, \u2248 7 \u00d7 1049 erg for a 56 N i production of 0.5 M\u2299 vs. 2 \u00d7 1051 erg\nreleased during the early explosive burning and any changes in the expansion\nvelocities are less than 2%. The energy release in the form of luminosity is\ndominated by the location of the photosphere within the expanding material, a\nfunction of the expansion and the opacity. As we will see below, small differences\nin the expansion rate caused by the central density of the WD, chemistry and\nexpansion rate will produce small deviations from the homogeneity in the light\ncurves on a 10 to 20 % level.\nIn the case of a Type Ia SN, acceleration of the material takes place during\nthe first few seconds to minutes, followed by the phase of free expansion. In\nlack of further acceleration, the radius of a gas element from the center is sim-\n\n\f6\n\nPeter H\u00f6flich et al.\n\nply proportional to the velocity r \u223c v. This means that gas further out moves\nfaster and hence stays further out; each shell expands without crossing another,\nmaintaining the original structure. As in cosmology it is useful to think in comoving coordinates, moving with the expansion. In these coordinates each shell,\nand hence slice of the original stellar structure, is preserved. So while material\nexpands out through a fixed radial distance from the center, the mass within a\ncomoving radius is constant with time. Therefore we often discuss the structure\nin terms of mass or velocity coordinates. Due to the expansion, the material cools\nalmost adiabatically as the volume increases rapidly: V \u223c r3 \u223c t3 . The increase\nin volume causes a corresponding decrease in density and hence optical depth.\nSo the photosphere slips deeper within the material, simultaneously allowing us\nto see further in. Note though that it still expands in physical radius, at least\nup to the time of peak magnitude.\nThe well determined energy source for the luminosity and the tight relation\nbetween the explosion and the observables, with their simultaneous insensitivity\nto details, are the building blocks on which our understanding of the homogeneity\nin the observable relations for SNe Ia is based.\nTo go beyond the homogeneity and take full advantage of the intrinsic properties of SNe Ia and to test for the influence of the metallicities, progenitors etc.,\nwe can perform detailed calculations which are consistent with respect to the\nprogenitors, explosion, light curves and spectra. These calculations include detailed nuclear networks, gamma-ray transport, non-LTE level populations, and\nmultidimensionality for parts of the problem. The numerical methods are briefly\ndescribed in the Appendix. For more details, see [19,20,27,29], and references\ntherein. The only remaining free parameters to address are the initial structure\nof the WD and the description of the nuclear burning front, which we discuss in\nthe next section.\n\n4\n\nDetailed Models, Observations and Cosmology\n\nIn examining possible scenarios, from the progenitor state to the explosion, we\nwill see that the most important properties are those that change the overall\nenergetics, such as the total energy content of the fuel and the amount of matter of the WD that undergoes burning. As we have alluded to in the previous\ndiscussions of \"stellar amnesia\", many of the results are quite stable, i.e. model\nindependent. In fact, we find 1) insensitivity of the WD structure to the progenitor star and system. This is caused by the electron degeneracy enforcing the\nmentioned weak dependence on the temperature and composition. 2) The time\nof the explosion (and therefore the WD density) is governed by the accretion rate\nshortly before the thermonuclear runaway causing the explosion. 3) Moreover,\nthe final outcome of the explosion is rather insensitive to details of the nuclear\nburning. While this is beneficial for the tightness of the observed luminosity\nrelation, it makes it difficult to investigate the pre-supernova physics, e.g. the\nexplosion scenario.\n\n\fType Ia Supernovae and Cosmology\n\n7\n\nFig. 2. Stellar structure at the final stage of the evolution of a 7 M\u2299 main sequence\nstar. At this stage, the star loses its H and He rich material with the central C/O-core\nremaining. This forms the C/O white dwarf which, eventually, becomes the accreting\nprogenitor in typical SNe Ia scenarios. On the right, we show the composition of the\ncore as a function of mass (in M\u2299 ). The region of reduced C abundance is produced\nduring the central helium burning which is convective (see also dark green center, left\nplot). Because the size of the helium burning core depends on the main sequence mass\nand the convection depends on the metallicity, the final structure depends on both\n(from [26]).\n\nHowever, new, high quality data and advances in supernovae simulations\nhave opened up new opportunities to constrain the physics of supernovae and to\nimprove the accuracy of their use as standardized candles below the 0.2m level.\nFor the first time, a direct relation with the progenitors seems to be within reach.\nIn particular, there is mounting evidence that the properties of the progenitor\nare directly responsible for the variety in SNe Ia. These properties include the\nchemical structure, rotation, and central density ([25], [81], [27]).\nThere is general agreement that SNe Ia result from some process of combustion of a degenerate WD [31]. WDs are the final stages of stellar evolution\nfor all stars with less than 7-8 M\u2299 (see Fig. 2). During the stellar evolution\non the main sequence, stars gain their energy from central burning of hydrogen to helium until H is exhausted in the central region. Subsequently, the star\nburns He to C and O in the center, surrounded by a hydrogen burning shell.\nWhen He becomes more depleted, the triple-\u03b1 process becomes less efficient and\n12\nC(\u03b1, \u03b3)16 O takes over, resulting in an inner region of low C abundance (see\nFig. 2, right panel). The size of the He burning core depends on the mass of the\nstar and on the metallicity/opacity because it is convective, i.e. material from\ndifferent radii mixes (e.g. [9]). At these final stages, the star loses most of its\nmass but with the C/O core remaining: a WD is born. If the star is a member of a close binary system it may gain mass at a sufficient rate to become a\nSNe Ia [58]. Because about 0.2 to 0.7 M\u2299 are accreted from an accretion disk,\nthe resulting WD may be strongly differential rotating [42].\nThe exact method of gaining mass sufficient to cause a supernova defines\nthree classes of models: (1) An explosion of a CO-WD, with mass close to the\n\n\f8\n\nPeter H\u00f6flich et al.\n\nFig. 3. Schematics of the explosion of a white dwarf near the Chandrasekhar mass.\nA thermonuclear runaway occurs near the center and a burning front propagates outwards ([28]). Initially, the burning front must start as a deflagration to allow a preexpansion because, otherwise, the entire WD would be burned to Ni. Alternatively,\nthe pre-expansion may be achieved during the non-explosive burning phase just prior\nto the thermonuclear runaway [27]. Subsequent burning is either a fast deflagration\nor a detonation. In pure deflagration models, a significant amount of matter remains\nunburned at the outer layers, and the inner layers show a mixture of burned and unburned material. In contrast, the models making a transition to a detonation produce\nthe observed layered chemical structure with little unburned matter, wiping out the\nhistory of deflagration (see text and Fig. 4). Note that all scenarios have a similar,\npre-expanded WD as an intermediate state.\n\nChandrasekhar mass MCh , having accreted mass through gravitational stripping\nof the outer layers (called Roche-lobe overflow) from an evolved companion star\n[85]. The explosion is mainly triggered by compressional heating near the WD\ncenter. (2) An explosion of a rotating configuration formed from the merging of\ntwo low-mass WDs, caused by the loss of angular momentum due to gravitational\nradiation from the binary system [83,32,62]. (3) An explosion of a low mass\nCO-WD triggered by the detonation of a helium layer accreted from a close\ncompanion [57,86,87]. This third class, the so-called edge-lit sub-Chandrasekhar\nWD model, has been ruled out on the basis of predicted light curves and spectra\n[24,60]. The first model, accretion to MCh , is the most successful when compared\nto observations.\nWithin the MCh scenario (see Fig. 1), the free model parameters are: 1)\nThe chemical structure of the exploding WD \u2013 given by the evolution of the\nprogenitor star and the central He-burning; 2) Its central density \u03c1c at the time\nof the explosion \u2013 dependent mainly on the accretion rate onto the WD; 3)\nThe description of the initial, subsonic burning front (deflagration); and 4) The\namount of burning prior to the transition from deflagration to detonation (see\nFig. 3). From these, the light curves and evolution of spectra follow directly.\n\n\fType Ia Supernovae and Cosmology\n\n9\n\nFig. 4. Structure of the deflagration front in an exploding C/O-WD (left) and the\nvelocity field (right) at about 2 seconds after runaway based on 3-D calculations by\nKhokhlov [38]. Light green and dark red/blue mark unburned and burned material,\nrespectively. During this phase, the expansion of the material is already almost spherical\n(right), and deviations of the density from sphericity are less than 2%. In normal bright\nSNe Ia, the transition to the detonation should occur in delayed detonation models at\nabout the time of these snapshots. In this case, the density in the inner region is\nsufficient to burn the unburned material up to Ni, eliminating the chemical contrast\nand leaving a layered structure. In contrast, in pure deflagration models, the density will\ndrop further before burning can take place, thus leaving intact the chemical contrast\nof the inner layers. In addition, the expansion of the outer layers is already close to\nthe speed of sound, faster than the burning front. As a consequence, all deflagration\nmodels show a massive outer layer of unburned matter.\n\nComparison with observations allow to constrain the parameters for a particular\nSNe Ia, its distance and the interstellar reddening (see below and Fig. 8).\nThe first two parameters set the stage. For the merging scenario, the front\nwill start as a detonation making parameters 3 and 4 dependent but adding the\nmass of the orbiting envelope as a free parameter. The MCh scenario requires\nparameters 3 and 4 because if the WD exploded purely from a thermonuclear\nrunaway reaction then almost all of the material would burn to 56 N i, in contradiction to observations that show only about 0.6 M\u2299 is produced. Instead,\na pre-expansion is needed to lower the density (see Fig. 3). This likely occurs\nduring an initial phase of a slow deflagration that preserves the structure but\ndecreases the binding energy. The lift in potential energy depends mainly on\nthe amount of burning, i.e. total energy produced, and almost not at all on the\nactual rate [8]. Thus, fortunately, details of nuclear burning in the non-linear\nregime of deflagration, about which our understanding is currently limited, will\nhardly affect the final LCs and spectra.\nSuccessful models need either a rapidly increasing deflagration speed and no\nradial mixing (e.g. W7 [59] \u2013 see footnote 1 ), or a deflagration-detonation transi1\n\nThe pure deflagration model W7 is a spherical model and, consequently, shows a\nlayered structure which is typical for detonations. Realistic 3-D deflagration models\ndo not show a radial layering of the abundances.\n\n\f10\n\nPeter H\u00f6flich et al.\n\nFig. 5. General properties of various explosion scenarios. Delayed detonation models\nand, possibly, merger models are the scenarios most likely realized in SNe Ia. Merger\nmodels may contribute to the populations but their large amount of unburned C/O at\nthe outer layers is inconsistent with the (few) IR-spectra obtained up to now and can\nlikely constitute only a small fraction of the SNe Ia population. Currently, pure deflagration models show no layered chemical structure, in disagreement with observations.\nHowever, as of now, 3-D deflagration models consider only the regime of large scale\ninstabilities, i.e. Rayleigh-Taylor, and start from static WDs (see text).\n\ntion (DDT) (see Fig. 3). The detonation or a very rapid deflagration is required\nto match observations that almost the entire WD is burned (see Fig. 6). Current infrared observations place tight upper limits on the amount of unburned\nmaterial. Depending on the specific SN Ia and the quality of the data, the constraints imposed lie between 0.01 to 0.2M\u2299 [84,27,50,72]. For general comparison\nof models, see Fig. 5. Delayed detonation (DD) models [34,88,89], those possessing a DDT, have been found to reproduce the optical and infrared light curves\nand spectra of \"typical\" SNe Ia reasonably well [20,21,22,12,60,84,45]. Here the\nburning starts as a well subsonic deflagration and then turns to a nearly sonic,\ndetonative mode of burning. Due to the one-dimensional nature of the model,\nthe speed of the subsonic deflagration and the moment of the transition to a\ndetonation are free parameters hence numbers 3 and 4 mentioned above. The\nmoment of deflagration-to-detonation transition is conveniently parameterized\nby introducing the transition density, \u03c1tr , at which it occurs. The amount of\n56\nNi, M56N i , depends primarily on \u03c1tr [20,21,79], and to a much lesser extent on\nthe assumed value of the deflagration speed, initial central density of the WD,\nand initial chemical composition (ratio of C to O). In essence this fixes the power\n\n\fType Ia Supernovae and Cosmology\n\n11\n\nFig. 6. Density (blue, dotted) and velocity (red, solid) as a function of the mass\ncoordinate [in MCh ] (left panels), and abundances of stable isotopes as a function\nof the expansion velocity (right panels), for delayed detonation models with \u03c1tr =\n8, 16 and 25 \u00d7106 g/cm3 (bottom to top). All models are based on the same MCh\nprogenitor with a main sequence mass of 3 M\u2299 , solar metallicity and a central density\nof 2 \u00d7 109 g/cm3 at the time of the explosion. These models produce 0.09, 0.26 and 0.6\nM\u2299 of 56 N i, respectively. In all cases, the entire WD is burned and, thus, all models\nhave similar explosion energies (from [29]).\n\nsource for the supernova light: models with a smaller transition density give less\nnickel and hence both lower peak luminosity and lower temperatures [20,21,79]\n(Figs. 6, 7). This is the first element in explaining the homogeneity of SNe Ia.\nThe second element is that, in DDs, almost the entire WD is burned, i.e.\nthe total production of nuclear energy is almost constant, and the density and\nvelocity structures hardly vary with the 56 N i production (Fig. 6). Together these\nform the basis of why, to first approximation, the SNe Ia relation between peak\nmagnitude and light curve width forms a one-parameter family. This can be\nwell understood as an opacity effect [23], i.e. as a consequence of the rapidly\ndropping opacity at low temperatures [19,35]. Less Ni means lower temperature\nso the emitted flux is shifted from the UV towards longer wavelengths where\nthere is less line blocking; as a consequence, the mean opacities are reduced. Less\nopacity means the photosphere retreats more rapidly to deeper layers, causing\na faster release of the stored energy and, as a consequence, steeper declining\nLCs together with the decreasing brightness. DD models thus give a natural and\nphysically well-motivated origin for the magnitude-light curve width relation of\nSNe Ia within the paradigm of thermonuclear combustion of Chandrasekharmass C/O-WDs. These models are able to reproduce light curves and spectra,\n\n\f12\n\nPeter H\u00f6flich et al.\n\nFig. 7. Maximum brightness MV as a function of \u03c1tr (upper left) and MV (\u2206M\u2206t=15d )\n(upper right) for delayed detonation models with \u03c1tr of 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 23,\n25 and 27 \u00d7106 g/cm3 from left to right. The red, vertical bar (upper right) gives the\nbrightness decline ratio as observed for SN1999by. In the lower panels, the comparison\nbetween theoretical and observed B and V LCs is given, implying a distance of 11 \u00b1 2.5\nMpc, consistent with independent estimates ([4]). By varying a single parameter, the\ntransition density at which detonation occurs, a set of models has been constructed\nwhich spans the observed brightness variation of SNe Ia. The absolute maximum brightness depends primarily on the 56 N i production, which for DD-models depends mainly\non the transition density \u03c1tr [27]. The brightness-decline relation MV (\u2206M\u2206t=15d ) observed in normal bright SNe Ia is also reproduced in these models (from [29]).\n\nand to determine the Hubble constant independently from primary distance\nindicators (see Fig. 8). Furthermore, they can explain both normal bright and\nvery subluminous SNe Ia within the same model (Figs. 7 and 9).\nOne of the uncertainties within SN modeling is the description of the nuclear\nburning fronts. While the propagation of a detonation front is well understood\nthe description of the deflagration front and the deflagration to detonation transition pose problems. On a microscopic scale, a deflagration propagates due to\nheat conduction by electrons. Though the laminar flame speed in SNe Ia is well\nknown, the front has been found to be Rayleigh-Taylor (R-T) unstable (see Fig.\n4) increasing the effective speed of the burning front [56]. More recently, significant progress has been made toward a better understanding of the physics\nof flames. Starting from static WDs, hydrodynamic calculations of the deflagration fronts have been performed in 2-D [68,46] and 3-D [47,36,38]. It has\nbeen demonstrated that R-T instabilities govern the morphology of the burning\nfront in the regime of linear instabilities, i.e. as long as perturbations remain\nsmall. During the first second after the thermonuclear runaway, the increase of\nthe flame surface due to R-T instability remains small and the effective burning\nspeed is close to the laminar speed (\u2248 50 km/s) if the ignition occurs close to\nthe center. Khokhlov [38] also shows that the effective burning speed is very\n\n\fType Ia Supernovae and Cosmology\n\n13\n\nFig. 8. Hubble values H are shown based on model fitting of the light curves and\nspectra of 27 individual SNe Ia including SN1988U at a redshift of 0.38 (not shown)\n[22]. We obtain Ho = 67 \u00b1 8km/sec/M pc within a 95 % level. This determination does\nnot depend on \u03b4-Ceph. calibration or other primary distance indicators. It is based on\nbasic nuclear physics and spectral constraints, and hardly depends on details of the\nexplosion models. One of the main uncertainties is related to the bolometric correction\nBC which connects the bolometric luminosity, i.e. the of 56 N i with the monochromatic\nbrightness. However, the accuracy of the bolometric correction can be tested modelindependent (see Fig. 16). The range for Ho owes its stability from spectral constraints.\nNamely, the observed maximum and minimum velocities of the 56 N i and Si/S layers\nwhich are \u2264 10, 500 and \u2265 8000km/sec for normal bright SNe Ia, respectively. The\nformer hardens the lower value for Ho because it provides an upper limit for the 56 N i\nmass which can be speezed within a certain expansion velocity (see 6). In the same\nway, the Si/S velocity sets the stage for the minimum 56 N i mass.\n\nsensitive to the energy release by the fuel, i.e. the local C/O ratio. Therefore,\nthe actual flame propagation may depend on the detailed chemical structure\nof the progenitor. Moreover, all current experiments are based on static WDs\nand assumed off-center points of ignition. Recent simulations of the final phases\nbefore the explosion put the validity of these assumptions into question [28].\nDespite advances, the mechanism is not well understood which leads to a DDT\nor, alternatively, to a fast deflagration in the non-linear regime of instabilities.\nPossible candidates for the mechanism are, among others, the Zel'dovich mechanism, i.e. mixing of burned and unburned material [37], crossing shock waves\nproduced in the highly turbulent medium, or shear flows of rising bubbles at\nlow densities [48,49]. An additional way is related shear instabilities present in\nrapidly, differentially rotating WDs. Then, as soon as rising plumes enter this\nregion of instability, they will be disrupted and strong mixed will occur. As a\nconsequence, the burning rate will strongly increase which may cause a DDT. As\ndiscussed above, we must expect differential rotation in progenitors because a\n\n\f14\n\nPeter H\u00f6flich et al.\n\nsignificant fraction of the progenitor mass has been accreted from a Kepler-disk.\nCurrently, none of the proposed mechanisms have been worked out in detail and\nshown to work in the environment of SNe Ia. However, as a common factor, all\nthese mechanisms will depend on the physical conditions prior to the DDT. In\nthe current state of the art we cannot predict a priori the distribution of brightness in a SNe sample because, within the most favored model, \u03c1tr determines\n\nFig. 9. Comparison of the observed near infrared spectra of the very subluminous\nSN99by on May 6 (upper left), May 16 (upper right), and May 24, 1999 (lower left).\nAt those times, the Thomson scattering photosphere is located at v = 13,000, 7000 and\n4000 km/s, respectively. For SN99by, the spectra are formed in layers of explosive C\nand incomplete Si burning up to about 2 weeks after maximum light. This is in strict\ncontrast to normal bright SNe Ia where the photosphere enters the layers of complete\nSi burning already at about maximum light. In very subluminous SNe Ia, the transition\ndensity is low and the pre-expansion sufficiently large (see Fig. 6) that the layers up to\n8000 km/s are not burned to 56 N i but to Si only. Hence, the 56 N i plumes produced\nduring the deflagration phase should survive (see Fig. 4). In the lower right, we show a\ncomparison of the observed and theoretical spectrum if we impose mixing of the inner\n0.7 M\u2299 . Obviously, strong mixing of the inner layers can be ruled out (see text and\n[29]). Current 3-D models for the deflagration phase starting from a static WD are\ninsufficient. Pre-conditioning of the progenitor is a key element, e.g. turbulent motions\nin the progenitor or rapid rotation. This is supported by spectropolarimetry of SN99by\nwhich shows an overall asymmetry of about 10 % with a well defined axis [30].\n\n\fType Ia Supernovae and Cosmology\n\n15\n\nFig. 10. Influence of the metallicity Z on the B and V light curves for a progenitor\nstar of 7 M\u2299 on the main sequence (see 2). For the composition structure, see Fig.\n2. The explosion model is based on a delayed detonation model typical for 'normal'\nSNe Ia (from [26]). The absolute brightness at maximum light is hardly affected (\u2206M =\n0.02m ). The rise time changes by about 1d and the decline rate over 15 days, \u2206M\u2206t=15d ,\nalso changes. When using the standard brightness decline relation, this would produce\nan offset by 0.1m . The dependencies can be well understood as a consequence of the\nmean C/O ratio and the temperature dependence of the opacities like the brightness\ndecline relation (see text and [25]). In our example, the total 56 N i production is similar.\nAs usual, the luminosity at maximum light is provided by both energy due to instant\nradioactive decay and thermal energy stored in the optically thick regions produced by\nradioactive decays at earlier times. The total explosion energies declines with the mean\nC/O ratio. The lower expansion rate causes less energy loss of thermal energy due to\nadiabatic expansion At maximum light, the distance of a given mass element doubles on\ntime scales of \u2248 10 to 11 days, respectively. At the same time after the explosion, more\nenergy is available for low C/O ratios, and the corresponding model shows a slower\nrise similar to a model with a larger 56 N i production. However, this delay also causes\na larger excess of luminosity compared to the instant energy production by radioactive\ndecays, and the photosphere is slightly cooler. The larger excess means a larger total\ndecline past maximum and the cooler photosphere results a faster receeding of the\nphotosphere. Consequently, the the decline rate is faster very similar to a slightly less\nluminous SNe Ia. Models with a lower mean C/O ratio show a slower increase and and\na faster decline [25]. Because the limited dependence of the nuclear energy production\non the C/O ratio, off-sets in the brightness decline relation are limited to \u2248 0.3m for\nthe entire range of potential progenitor masses and metallicities [9], and may cause a\nspread of a similar order around the mean brightness decline relation.\n\nthe brightness. Rather we take this as an input parameter and can investigate\nthe small deviations from the brightness decline relation.\nAlthough pure deflagration models are possible, current 3-D models show\nproperties inconsistent with the observations (Fig. 5). Namely, pure deflagration\nmodels predict a significant fraction of the C/O WD remains unburned and a\nmixture of burned and unburned material at all radii/velocities (e.g. [3,11] and\nsee Fig. 9). Constraints from infrared observations provide good evidence that\nthe WD is almost fully incinerated in normal bright SNe Ia [84,72,50]. And in\ncontrast to pure deflagration models, in DD-models the detonation front erases\nthe chemical structure left behind by the deflagration (Fig. 4). Note that the\n\n\f16\n\nPeter H\u00f6flich et al.\n\nFig. 11. Influence of main sequence mass (left) and initial metallicity (right) on B (-),\nV (.... ) and B-V (- - -) magnitudes at maximum light. All quantities are given relative\nto the reference model with a main sequence mass of 5M\u2299 and solar metallicity. In the\nright panel, the numbers 1,2,3,4 on the axis refer to Z of 0.02, 0.001, 0.0001 and 10\u221210 ,\nrespectively (from [9]).\n\n\"classical\" deflagration model W7 [59] shows a layered structure similar to DDmodels because it has been calculated in spherical geometry rather than the\nunlayered structure to be expected from 3-D deflagration models.\nIn conclusion, the transition to a detonation or (less likely) to a very fast\ndeflagration determines the 56 N i production and causes the one-parameter relation between peak magnitude and LC width. To a much lesser extent variations\nof the other parameters lead to some deviation from perfect homogeneity on the\n0.2m level. For example, an increase in the central density increases the electron capture close to the center, shifting the nuclear statistical equilibrium away\nfrom 56 N i [23]. Empirically, the magnitude-light curve width relation has been\nwell established with a rather small statistical error \u03c3 (0.18m [14],0.12m [69],\n0.16m [75], 0.14m [67], 0.17m [63]). These correspond to 5-8% in distance. Note\nthe predicted dispersion for DD models is somewhat larger than observed but\nsignificantly smaller than generic models which show a dispersion of 0.7m [23].\nThis may imply a correlation between free model parameters, namely the\nproperties of the burning front, and the main sequence mass of the progenitor MMS , metallicity Z, and the central density of the WD at the time of the\nexplosion. As we have discussed above, there is growing evidence that the final outcome of the explosion is determined by the pre-conditioning of the WD,\nnamely the properties of the WD, its rotation and the final evolution which leads\nto the thermonuclear runaway [25,26,9,28]. Thus, we must expect that correlations between observables exist and can be used to further tighten the dispersion\ncaused by second order parameters (Figs. 10 & 11; see the summary table in Fig.\n12). From this very argument, we must also expect a shift with redshift in the\nmean properties of the order of 0.2m due to the population drift in the progenitor characteristics and environments. Nevertheless, the spread around the\nbrightness decline relation may show little change. As one possible example, the\nmean metallicity and typical progenitor mass at the main sequence will decrease\nwith redshift and cause systematic changes in the brightness decline relation\n\n\fType Ia Supernovae and Cosmology\n\n17\n\nFig. 12. Summary of observational effects due to changes in the initial metallicity,\nmain sequence mass, and central density for Chandrasekhar mass WD progenitors,\nand in the progenitor scenario [20,22,25,26,9].\n\n(Figs. 10 & 11). These effects can be recognized and compensated for if well\nobserved light curves and spectra are obtained. Fig. 12 summarizes many of\nthe relevant features, their expected size, and their effect on the observables\nbased on advanced models. Note that detailed analyzes of observed spectra and\nlight curves indicate that mergers and deflagration models such as W7 may contribute to the SN population [22,15]. To determine the nature of the dark energy\nthrough the use of SNe Ia as precision distance indicators, we need to reduce the\nresidual systematic uncertainties well below the statistical dispersions [63,64,1].\nThis is the reason why we need comprehensive observational programs producing well characterized samples, from ground based supernovae surveys such as\nthe Nearby SN Factory [55], the ESSENCE project [10], and the CFH Legacy\nSurvey [6] for low redshifts, and the w-project and space-based missions such as\nthe Supernova/Acceleration Probe [76] for high redshifts.\n\n5\n\nConclusions\n\nSupernovae studies have greatly progressed over the last several years due to\nadvances in both observations and modeling. We are now able to analyze the\nexplosion and resulting SNe properties in some detail, and can obtain answers\nto a number of long standing, interesting questions. While we cannot predict a\npriori the peak magnitude, we have seen that we can understand the origin of\nboth the near homogeneity and those tight observable relations describing the\nfirst order deviations. Stability of the SNe Ia observables \u2013 stellar amnesia \u2013 arise\nbecause the nuclear physics determines the structure of the white dwarfs, and the\n\n\f18\n\nPeter H\u00f6flich et al.\n\nexplosion. Although pathways to SNe Ia span a variety, the information about\nthe specific history is largely lost along the way to the progenitor and during\nthe explosion. Thus, convergence due to physics leads to a generic accuracy of\nSNe Ia as distance indicators on the 0.2m level. However, these details are needed\nfor the next level of precision. In particular, pre-conditioning of the explosion\nseems to be a key element. These secondary parameters can be revealed through\ndetailed models in combination with comprehensive observations which include\nboth spectra extending to the near infrared and light curves from early times to\nwell after maximum light (see table in Fig. 12). This approach is supported by\ncurrent observations (e.g. [67]). Future surveys will provide the rich resource of\ndata to constrain and refine our understanding of SN progenitors and explosion\nphysics. Using all the empirical data the supernovae provide, together with the\ntight relation between the observables and models enables us to significantly\ndeduce their absolute magnitude with confidence. Thus, SNe Ia are simple, and\nwill be well understood, standardizable candles for cosmological distance tests.\nAcknowledgements: It is pleasure to thank A.

Yamaoka H., Nomoto K., Shigeyama T., Thielemann F.K. 1992, ApJ, 393, 55\n\nAppendix A: Numerical Radiation Hydrodynamics\nThe computational tools summarized below were used to carry out many of\nthe analyzes of SNIa and Core Collapse Supernovae ([16], H\u00f6flich, M\u00fcller &\nKhokhlov 1993, [20], [30], ...). A consistent treatment of the explosion, light\ncurves and spectra are needed (see Fig. 13). Details of the numerical methods\nand codes, namely HYDRA, can be found in [29] and references therein. Here\nwe give a brief outline of the basic concepts.\nA.1 Hydrodynamics\nThe explosions are calculated using a spherical radiation-hydro code, including\nnuclear networks ([25] and references therein). This code solves the hydrodynamical equations explicitly by the piecewise parabolic method [7] and includes\n\n\fType Ia Supernovae and Cosmology\n\n21\n\nFig. 13. Temperature T, energy deposition due to radioactive decay E\u03b3 , Rosseland\noptical depth T au (left scale) and density log(\u03c1) (right scale) are given as a function\nof distance (in 1015 cm) for a typical SNe Ia at 15 days after the explosion. For comparison, we give the temperature Tgrey for the grey extended atmosphere. The light\ncurves and spectra of SNe Ia are powered by energy release due to radioactive decay\nof 56 N i \u219256 Co \u219256 F e. The two dotted, vertical lines indicate the region of spectra\nformation. Most of the energy is deposited within the photosphere and, due to the\nsmall optical depth and densities, strong NLTE effects occur up to the very central\nregion. At maximum light, the diffusion time scales are comparable to the expansion\ntime scales mandating a consistent treatment of LCs and spectra (from H\u00f6flich 1995).\n\nthe solution of the frequency averaged radiation transport implicitly via moment\nequations, expansion opacities (see below), and a detailed equation of state. Nuclear burning is taken into account using a network which has been tested in\nmany explosive environments (see [78], and references therein). The propagation\nof the nuclear burning front is given by the velocity of sound behind the burning front in the case of a detonation wave, and in a parameterized form during\nthe deflagration phase, calibrated by detailed 3-D calculations (e.g. [38]). The\ndensity for the transition from deflagration to detonation is treated as a free\nparameter.\n5.1\n\nA.2 Light Curves\n\nFrom these explosion models the subsequent expansion and bolometric and broad\nband light curves (LC) are calculated following the method described by [25],\n\n\f22\n\nPeter H\u00f6flich et al.\n\nFig. 14. Block diagram of our numerical scheme to solve radiation hydrodynamical\nproblems including detailed equation of state, nuclear and atomic networks. For specific\nproblems, a subset of the modules is employed (see text, and e.g. Figs. 7 & 9).\n\nand references therein. The LC-code is the same as used for the explosion except\nthat \u03b3-ray transport is included via a Monte Carlo scheme and nuclear burning\nis neglected. In order to allow a more consistent treatment of the expansion,\nwe solve the time-dependent, frequency-averaged radiation moment equations.\nThe frequency-averaged variable Eddington factors and mean opacities are calculated from the frequency-dependent transport equations in a co-moving frame\nat each time step. The averaged opacities have been calculated assuming local\nthermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). Both the monochromatic and mean opacities are calculated in the narrow line limit. Scattering, photon redistribution, and\nthermalization terms, calibrated by the full non-LTE-atomic models, have been\nincluded. About one thousand frequencies (in one hundred frequency groups)\nand about nine hundred depth points are used.\n5.2\n\nA.3 Spectral Calculations\n\nOur non-LTE code ([20], and references therein) solves the relativistic radiation\ntransport equations in a co-moving frame. The spectra are computed for various\nepochs using the chemical, density, and luminosity structure and \u03b3-ray deposition\nresulting from the light curve coder. This provides a tight coupling between\n\n\fType Ia Supernovae and Cosmology\n\n23\n\nthe explosion model and the radiative transfer. The effects of instantaneous\nenergy deposition by \u03b3-rays, the stored energy (in the thermal bath and in\nionization) and the energy loss due to the adiabatic expansion are taken into\naccount. Bound-bound, bound-free and free-free opacities are included in the\nradiation transport, which has been discretized with about 2 \u00d7 104 frequencies\nand 97 radial points.\nThe radiation transport equations are solved consistently with the statistical\nequations and ionization due to \u03b3-radiation for the most important elements and\nions. Typically, between 27 and 137 bound levels are used for C, O, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti,\nFe, Co, Ni with a total of about 40,000 individual NLTE-lines. The neighboring\nionization stages have been approximated by simplified atomic models restricted\nto a few NLTE levels + LTE levels. The energy levels and cross sections of\nbound-bound transitions are taken from [40,41] starting at the ground state. The\nbound-free cross sections are taken from TOPBASE [52]. Collisional transitions\nare treated in the 'classical' hydrogen-like approximation [53] that relates the\nradiative to the collisional gf-values. All form factors are set to 1. About 106\nadditional lines are included (out of a line list of 4 \u00d7 107 ) assuming LTE-level\npopulations. The scattering, photon redistribution, and thermalization terms are\ncomputed with an equivalent-two-level formalism.\n\n6\n\nAppendix B: Uncertainties\n\nIn the detailed numerical models described in the last section we can identify\nthree kinds of uncertainties: 1) uncertainties in the nuclear and atomic data such\nas cross-sections and opacities, 2) errors due to inconsistencies, discretization,\nand approximations for the numerical solution, and 3) conceptual simplifications\nin the supernova scenario. In Fig. 15 and [17,19,35], the effects of the opacities,\nscattering ratio, approximations for (gray) radiation transport and different frequency averaging procedures have been tested with respect to typical properties\nof the LCs such as the absolute brightness MV , rise time tV and color index\nB-V (Figs. 15, 16). Before these papers, theoretical models were based on the\ndiffusion approximation and opacities that were constant with density, chemistry\nand time. Clearly, those assumptions were not adequate. However, within reasonable simplifications, the uncertainties in bolometric luminosity Lbol , absolute\nmagnitude in V band MV , time of peak V magnitude tV , and color (flux ratio)\nB-V have been found to be less than 10%, even if the opacities have been scaled\nby a factor of 3 either way.\nWithin this narrow range the numerical solution of the radiation transport\nproblem helps to improve the differences between Lbol and the energy production\ndue to 56 N i. As discussed in sections III and IV there exists a strong physical\nbasis for this as well as tight model restrictions on the variation. Extensive tests\nshowed variations in Lbol /E\u03b3 are less than \u00b120% even if we allow for model assumptions which have since been ruled out or for use of clearly simplified approximations (e.g. one-zone model). The exact time of maximum light is governed by\nwhen the temperature drops below \u2248 10, 000K, i.e. when the mean opacity drops\n\n\f24\n\nPeter H\u00f6flich et al.\n\nFig. 15. Systematic study of the influence of physical approximations for an early\n(\u2248 1990) DD-model based on frequency averaged LC calculations [19]. N21: scattering + absorption + full RT, N21S: N21 but pure scattering lines, N21A: N21 - but\npure absorption lines, N21D: diffusion approximation. Nowadays, we use multi-group,\nNLTE-LCs, and more realistic WDs are used (e.g. [22,25]).\n\nFig. 16. Observational test for the bolometric correction BC. BC is defined by the\ndifference of a spectral distribution in V compared to the solar irradiance. We give the\ncomparison of the solar flux (thin line) and SN1992A at about 5 days past maximum\nlight [39]. In addition, the filter functions for B and V are shown. The horizontal line at\nabout 5500 \u00c5 (labeled BC=0.1m ) gives the level predicted by the model for SN1999A\n(from [22]). BC=0.7m and \u22120.6m would be required for values of Ho being 50 and 80\nkm/sec/M pc and, clearly, can be ruled out.\n\n\fType Ia Supernovae and Cosmology\n\n25\n\nby several orders of magnitude [17,19,35]. Prior to maximum light, the drop in\nthe temperature is governed by the expansion work and only to a small degree\nby radiation transport effects [19]. Note that V is well determined because it is in\nthe linear tail of the emissivity. Uncertainties in B, in particular past maximum\nlight, have been found to be up to 0.2m because the size of line blocking and\nphoton redistribution effects change drastically over the period considered.\nWe can also test the global energy conservation based purely on observations and predictions. Fig. 16 shows the relation between luminosity and the\nmonochromatic colors, known as the bolometric correction BC. The empirical\nand model based factors for BC agree to better than 0.1m [22]. Another class of\ntest is based on predictions of distances for individual SNe Ia [18,54] made prior\nto their determination based on \u03b4Ceph stars by HST: all but one agreed well\nwithin the 1\u03c3-error bars (see table 1 from [22]). A notable exception was the\npeculiar SN1991T for which [17] predicted a distance of 14.5 \u00b1 2 Mpc while distance measurements of a neighboring galaxy (host of 60f) suggested a distance\nof 19Mpc [73]. However, recently a direct measurement of the host galaxy by\n\u03b4Ceph reduced the distance to 13.5 Mpc [74].\nDiscretization errors have been tested by doubling the number of depth points\n(e.g. [35], [20]). Typically, we use 456 to 912 depth points. The errors are found\nto be less than a few percent in the total energy and the production of elements\nduring the explosion. For the LCs and spectra, the resulting fluxes change by\nless than 1% [20]. In the LC flux calculations, the main sources of errors are due\nto the limitations of the frequency grid, the neglect of aberration terms in the\nradiation transport equation, and the use of simplified atomic models for the\nfrequency redistribution of photons. If we compare the LCs with the spectral\ncalculations, the resulting error is < 10% in the flux and about 0.05m and 0.2m\nin B-V around maximum light and about 2 weeks after maximum, respectively\n[20,5,25,27].\nErrors can arise because the models are simplifications of reality, e.g. adopting\nspherical symmetry. Deviations from this could be due to either global asymmetries in the density or the distribution of elements [80,82,30]. In general, only\nupper limits for normal bright SNe Ia are given; recent observations with VLT\nindicate a level of about 0.1%, which translates into a direction dependent luminosity of \u2248 0.1m [17]. However, the subluminous SN1999by shows polarization\nas high as 0.7% [30], and rotational symmetry. This implies that the luminosity\nwill vary by about 0.3m , depending on the position of the observer.\nAnother possible breakdown in geometry is the description of the burning\nfront but, currently, the size of this effect is hard to estimate. As noted above, 3-D\nmodels are currently limited to the regime of linear instabilities and a significant\namount of C/O remains unburned (\u2248 0.5 \u2212 0.8M\u2299 ). Clearly, these early 3-D\nattempts are in contradiction with observations.\n\n\f"}
