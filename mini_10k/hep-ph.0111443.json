During that time, the CDF\nand D\u00d8 experiments conducted an extensive program of diffractive studies\non soft single and double diffraction, several diffractively produced hard processes, and double-Pomeron exchange. After reviewing the results obtained\nby each experiment, we describe the forward detector upgrades for Run II.\n2\n\nRun I diffractive physics results from CDF\n\n\u221a\nCDF measured the single diffraction differential cross section at s = 546 and\n1800 GeV.1 A fit of the data at both energies to the standard triple-Pomeron\nRegge formula for single diffraction dissociation shows that Regge theory correctly predicts the dependence on the rapidity-gap width \u2206\u03b7 (\u03b7 \u2261 \u2212 ln tan 2\u03b8 )\nfor \u2206\u03b7 > 3, which corresponds\n\u221a to a leading proton fractional momentum\nloss \u03be < 0.05. However, the s dependence of the overall normalization is\nnot correctly \u221a\nmodeled, the data being an order of magnitude lower than the\nprediction at s = 1800 GeV.\nThe double-diffraction differential cross section was recently studied with\na sample of minimum-bias events, i.e. events collected by triggering on a\nbeam-beam counter coincidence between the proton and antiproton sides of\n0\nthe detector.2 The diffractive event rate is approximately flat in \u2206\u03b7exp\n\u2261\n\u03b7max \u2212 \u03b7min, where \u03b7max (\u03b7min ) is the pseudorapidity of the particle closest to\n\u03b7 = 0 in the (anti)proton direction. In contrast, the non-diffractive event\nrate\n\u221a\n0\ndecreases exponentially with increasing \u2206\u03b7exp\n. The data at both s = 630\n0\nand 1800 GeV clearly exhibit a double-diffractive component for \u2206\u03b7exp\n> 3,\n0\nand the \u2206\u03b7exp dependence of this component is correctly described by Regge\n\n\fTable 1.

The measured double diffraction cross sections are:\n\u221a\n\u03c3DD ( s = 630 GeV, \u2206\u03b7 > 3) = 4.58 \u00b1 0.02 (stat) \u00b1 1.5 (syst) mb,\n\u221a\n\u03c3DD ( s = 1800 GeV, \u2206\u03b7 > 3) = 6.32 \u00b1 0.03 (stat) \u00b1 1.7 (syst) mb.\nThese measurements are about an order of magnitude lower than expectations\nbased on the triple-Pomeron amplitude.\nSingle diffractive events can be identified by the presence of a \"rapidity\ngap\", i.e. a rapidity interval devoid of particles, in the forward region on one\nside of the detector. Using this signature, CDF has measured the ratio R of\nsingle-diffractive to non-diffractive rates\u221aof events containing a W -boson3 , a\ndijet4 , a b-quark5, and a J/\u03c8 meson6 at s = 1800 GeV. As shown in Table 1,\nall these ratios are of order 1%. Since the processes listed have different\nsensitivities to the quark and gluon content of the Pomeron, the ratios can\nbe used to extract the gluon fraction fgIP in the Pomeron. An analysis of the\nW , dijet, and b results yields fgIP = 0.54+0.16\n\u22120.14 . The same analysis also shows\nthat all the diffractive to non-diffractive ratios are consistently suppressed\nby a factor D = 0.19 \u00b1 0.04 with respect to expectations based on HERA\nmeasurements and QCD factorization, indicating a breakdown of the latter.\nEven though J/\u03c8 and b production both occur mainly via initial-state gluon\nfusion, their R values disagree. This discrepancy can be entirely ascribed to\nthe difference in kinematic region probed by the two processes.6\nThe bottom two lines of Table 1 give the ratios of dijet event rates with\nand without a gap between the jets.7,8,9 The measured fraction of color-singlet\nexchange is constant as function of \u2206\u03b7 jet , ETjet and xbj .\nA Roman pot spectrometer allows CDF to detect leading antiprotons\nand to determine \u03be and the four-momentum transfer squared t. CDF measured\nthe ratio of single-diffractive to non-diffractive dijet production rates at\n\u221a\ns = 180010 and 630 GeV11 as a function of the xbj of the struck parton in\n\n\fthe p\u0304. In leading order QCD, this ratio equals the ratio of the corresponding\nstructure functions and can therefore be used to extract the diffractive structure function of the proton. The CDF diffractive structure function is steeper\nthan, and severely suppressed relative to predictions based on extrapolations\nof the diffractive parton densities extracted by the H1 collaboration from DIS\nmeasurements at HERA.\nA search for exclusive dijet production by double-Pomeron exchange (p +\np\u0304 \u2192 p\u2032 + jet1 + jet2 + p\u0304\u2032 ) yielded a 95% C.L. upper limit of 3.7 nb for 0.035 <\n\u03bep\u0304 < 0.095 and jets with ET > 7 GeV and \u22124.2 < \u03b7 < 2.4.12\n3\n\nCDF forward detector upgrades\n\nThe CDF forward detector for Run II is shown schematically in Figure 1. This\nsystem comprises a Roman Pot spectrometer to detect leading antiprotons and\nmeasure \u03be and t, beam shower counters on both sides of the central detector\n(5.5 < |\u03b7| < 7.5) for triggering on events with forward rapidity gaps, and two\n\"miniplug\" calorimeters in the region 3.5 < |\u03b7| < 5.5.\n\nROMAN\nPOTS\n\nA-48\nDIPOLES\n\nz\n\nELECTROSTATIC\nSEPARATOR\n\nCDF\n\nESS\n\nTOROID\n\nMINIPLUG\n\nQUADS\n\n56.40 m\n\n31.63 m\n\n23.23 m\n\nBSC-4\n\nBSC-3\n\nBSC-2\n\n6.35 m\n\n0\n\nBSC-1\n\nFigure 1.

This observation is consistent with a soft-color rearrangement\nmodel preferring initial quark states. Photon-like, U(1), and current twogluon models do not adequately describe the data.\n\n\f\u221a\nMore recently, D\u00d8 studied hard single diffraction at s = 630 and 1800\nGeV. 16 At each energy, a sample of forward dijets (with the two leading\njet pseudorapidities \u03b71 , \u03b72 > 1.6 or < \u22121.6) and a sample of central dijets\n(with |\u03b71 |, |\u03b72 | < 1) are defined. Diffractive events are then identified by\nthe rapidity-gap method. Table 2 shows the fractions of gap events for the\nfour data samples and compares them with various models for the Pomeron\nstructure function. The predictions for a hard-gluon structure are far higher\nTable 2. Measured and predicted gap fractions and their ratios for the 630 and 1800 GeV\nforward (F) and central (C) dijet samples. Predictions are given for four different Pomeron\nstructure functions s(\u03b2): hard gluon (s(\u03b2) \u221d \u03b2(1 \u2212 \u03b2)), flat gluon (s(\u03b2) const.), soft gluon\n(s(\u03b2) \u221d (1 \u2212 \u03b2)5 ) and quark (s(\u03b2) \u221d \u03b2(1 \u2212 \u03b2)).\n\nSample\n1800 F\n1800 C\n630 F\n630 C\n630\n1800\n630\n1800\n\n1800\n630\n\nF\nC\nF\nC\nF\nC\n\nData\n0.65 \u00b1 0.04\n0.22 \u00b1 0.05\n1.19 \u00b1 0.08\n0.90 \u00b1 0.06\n1.8 \u00b1 0.2\n4.1 \u00b1 0.9\n\n3.0 \u00b1 0.7\n1.3 \u00b1 0.1\n\nGap Fractions (%)\nHard G.\nFlat G.\nSoft G.\nQuark\n2.2 \u00b1 0.3\n2.2 \u00b1 0.3\n1.4 \u00b1 0.2 0.79 \u00b1 0.12\n2.5 \u00b1 0.4\n3.5 \u00b1 0.5 0.05 \u00b1 0.01 0.49 \u00b1 0.06\n3.9 \u00b1 0.9\n3.1 \u00b1 0.8\n1.9 \u00b1 0.4\n2.2 \u00b1 0.5\n5.2 \u00b1 0.7\n6.3 \u00b1 0.9 0.14 \u00b1 0.04 1.6 \u00b1 0.2\nRatios of Gap Fractions\n1.7 \u00b1 0.4\n1.4 \u00b1 0.3\n1.4 \u00b1 0.3\n2.7 \u00b1 0.6\n2.1 \u00b1 0.4\n\n1.8 \u00b1 0.3\n\n0.88 \u00b1 0.18 0.64 \u00b1 0.12\n0.75 \u00b1 0.16 0.48 \u00b1 0.12\n\n3.1 \u00b1 1.1\n30. \u00b1 8.\n13. \u00b1 4.\n\n3.2 \u00b1 0.5\n\n1.6 \u00b1 0.3\n1.4 \u00b1 0.3\n\nthan supported by the data. A quark structure yields better agreement, but\nhas been shown by CDF to predict an excessive rate of diffractive W bosons.\nRatios of gap fractions provide additional information,\nas the Pomeron flux\n\u221a\nfactor cancels in ratios evaluated at the same s. The bottom two lines of\nthe table show that, in spite of this cancellation, a hard-gluon structure still\ndoes not model the data. D\u00d8 concludes that a gluon-dominated Pomeron,\ncontaining both soft and hard \u221a\ncomponents, and combined with a flux factor\nthat decreases with increasing s, could describe all the data samples.\n5\n\nD\u00d8 forward detector upgrades\n\nThe Run II upgrade of the D\u00d8 detector includes a Forward Proton Detector (FPD)17 , whose layout is shown in Figure 2. The FPD consists of nine\nindependent spectrometers, each of which uses magnets in the accelerator\n\n\flattice together with position measurements along the (anti)proton track to\ndetermine the (anti)proton momentum and scattering angle. There are eight\nquadrupole spectrometers, four on each side of the central detector, measuring\ntracks in both the horizontal and vertical planes, and one dipole spectrometer\non the antiproton side. This configuration has several advantages:\n\u2022 Having quadrupoles on both sides allows detection of elastic scattering\nevents for alignment purposes and to monitor luminosity.\n\u2022 Halo backgrounds can be rejected by diagonally opposite spectrometers,\nas in-time halo tracks on one side appear as early hits on the other.\n\u2022 The possibility to tag both protons and antiprotons will allow unambiguous measurements of double-Pomeron exchange.\n\u2022 A quadrupole spectrometer requires a minimum scattering angle, or |t|,\nto accept a proton, whereas a dipole spectrometer requires a minimum\nmomentum loss \u03be. Therefore, the dipole spectrometer on the p\u0304 side is\ncrucial to calculate the acceptance of the quadrupole spectrometers, to\navoid uncertainties in the extrapolation to |t| = 0, and to provide large\nacceptance for high-mass events and double-Pomeron exchange.\nThe spectrometers are incorporated into the standard D\u00d8 triggering and data\nacquisition system, thereby enabling the collection of large samples of diffractive events. For 1 fb\u22121 of integrated luminosity, D\u00d8 expects to collect about\n1K diffractive W bosons, 3K hard double-Pomeron events, and 500K diffractive dijets.\n6\n\nDiffractive physics program for Tevatron Run II\n\nSignificant forward detector upgrades implemented by both D\u00d8 and CDF will\nallow for a detailed study of the diffractive structure function of the proton,\nincluding its process dependence, if any. It should be possible to observe\nexclusive production of dijets by double Pomeron exchange, as well as lowmass exclusive states (glueballs?) Jet-gap-jet events at high \u2206\u03b7 jet will provide\na testing ground for BFKL. Finally, there is always the hope of making some\nunexpected discovery.\nAcknowledgments\nI would like to thank Dino Goulianos and Andrew Brandt for their help with\nthe preparation of this summary, and the symposium organizers and secretaries for a very interesting and successful meeting.\n\n\fRoman\nPot\nDetector\n\nA1Q\n\nA1S\nS\n\nD\n\nAD2 AD1\n59 57\n\nA2S\n33\n\np\n\np\n\nA2Q\n23\n\nP1Q\nQ2 Q3 Q4\n\nQ4 Q3 Q2\n\nS\n\nP2Q\n0\n\nP1S\n\n23\n\nP2S\n33\n\nZ(m)\nFigure 2.
