Introduction\n\nThe Argonne Wakefield Accelerator (AWA) facility [1] is used to investigate\nelectron beam-driven, high-gradient wakefield acceleration techniques. The generation of\nhigh accelerating gradients (>100 MeV/m) in wakefield structures or plasmas requires a\nhigh charge (10-100 nC), short pulse (3-5 psec) electron drive bunch. While most rf\nphotocathode gun designs are optimized for high-brightness, low-charge (~1 nC)\napplications, such as free electron lasers, the 1.5 cell, L-band AWA rf photocathode gun,\nor \"Drive Gun,\" is optimized for high-charge operation mode. The high-brightness\napplication we are pursuing is the development of a compact, high-precision wakefield\nmeasurement system for the purpose of characterizing slow-wave structures as described\nin the reference [2].\n\nRecently, we have begun an investigation to determine if the high-charge AWA Drive\nGun can also be operated in a high-brightness operation mode. High-brightness rf\nphotocathode guns routinely generate 1 nC beams with normalized transverse emittances\nin the neighborhood of 2 \u2013 5 \u03bcm. Since the Drive Gun had already been optimized for\nhigh-charge operation, we realized that it might not be possible to generate such highbrightness beam with this gun. However, recent simulations [2] performed with\nPARMELA [3] indicate that high-brightness operation is possible provided that a\nsufficiently high accelerating gradient (peak field on-axis = E z 0 = 80 MV / m ) in the gun\ncan be reached.\n\n3\n\n\fIn this paper, we present the results of experiments to characterize the AWA Drive\nGun operating in the high-brightness, low-charge mode are presented. Spot size\nmeasurements were made of the 8 MeV, 1 nC beam at 3 locations in the drift region\ndownstream of the Drive Gun as the rf launch phase of the gun was varied from\napproximately 300 to 700. These measurements were then analyzed in two different\nways: (1) the spot sizes were compared to predictions from the beam dynamics code\nPARMELA; and (2) the spot sizes were used to investigate the capabilities of a modified\n3-screen emittance measurement method. This modified method differs from the\nstandard method in that its beam envelope model includes space-charge effects in\naddition to emittance effects, since it is well known that standard method fails for spacecharge dominated beams. The outline for the remainder of this paper is as follows. We\npresent: (i) the experimental setup and technique used to measure the beam envelope and\nemittance, (ii) the results of the experimental measurements; and (iii) a discussion of\nresults.\n\n2. The Experimental Setup and Technique\n\nIn this section, we first describe the experimental setup including the main\ncomponents of the beamline where the spot size measurements were made, the Drive\nGun, and the photocathode laser system; and second the experimental technique of the\nmodified 3-screen emittance measurement method.\n\n2.1 The AWA Gun Test Stand\n\n4\n\n\fIn Figure 1, a highly simplified version of the AWA Gun Test Stand (GTS) beamline\nshows only the elements that were used during these measurements. The block labeled\n\"Gun & Solenoids\" consist of the Drive Gun and three solenoids as described in detail\nbelow. The two diagnostics elements used are: (1) a single Bergoz integrating current\ntransformer (ICT) for nondestructive measurement of the beam charge; and (2) three\nYAG:Ce (YAG) phosphor screens for beam profile measurements (YAG-1, YAG-2, and\nYAG-3). The YAG screens were mounted on pneumatic actuators, were purchased from\nCrytur Ltd., and have dimensions of 250 \u03bcm thick by 50 mm in diameter.\n\nTHE RF PHOTOCATHODE GUN\n\nThe AWA Drive Gun [1] is similar in design to the standard BNL/SLAC/UCLA rf\nphotocathode gun with an emittance compensating solenoid. The Drive Gun is an Lband, 1.5 cell, rf photocathode gun operating in the \u03c0-mode at 1300 MHz and currently\nuses a Mg photocathode. Power from a 30 MW L-band Klystron is side-coupled into the\ndownstream full cell and then on-axis coupled into the upstream half cell. Two\nsolenoids, the bucking and the focusing solenoids, are placed symmetrically about the\nplane of the photocathode while a third solenoid, the matching solenoid, is located at the\nexit of the gun. The focusing and matching solenoids work together as the effective\nemittance compensating solenoid, while the bucking solenoid is used to buck out the\nmagnetic field of the focusing solenoid at the cathode. We have recently implemented a\nlaser cleaning system and initial estimates show that the quantum efficiency was\nimproved by about an order of magnitude.\n5\n\n\fThe Drive Gun has been successfully conditioned and routinely generates electron\nbunches with charge up to 100 nC. Using 13 MW of incident power, the gun is normally\noperated at E z 0 = 80 MV / m which generates a beam energy at the gun exit of about 8\nMeV. The bucking and focusing solenoids are operated with on-axis peak magnetic flux\ndensity of B z = 0.92 kG while the matching solenoid runs at Bz = 4.5 kG . Under these\nconditions, the emittance compensated minimum is located approximately 2.5 m\ndownstream of the photocathode.\n\nTHE AWA PHOTOCATHODE GUN LASER SYSTEM\n\nThe AWA laser system consists of a Tsunami oscillator purchased from Spectra\nPhysics and a TSA-50 chirped-pulse amplifier (CPA) from Positive Light. The oscillator\nis a regenerative mode-locking Ti:Sapphire oscillator tuned to \u03bb = 744 nm (\u2206\u03bb = 9 nm, E\n= 7 nJ) output that is pumped by an all solid-state 5 W, cw, green laser (Millennia V).\nThe oscillator runs at the 16th sub-harmonic (81.25 MHz) of the rf (1300 MHz) and is\nphase locked to within 1 psec (r.m.s. jitter) of the rf using the vendor's Lok-to-Clock box.\nThe CPA consists of a stretcher followed by a Ti:Sapphire regenerative amplifier (regen),\ntwo stages of linear Ti:sapphire amplifiers and a compressor. After reducing the\nbandwidth with a mask in the stretcher, the seed pulse exits the stretcher with a pulse\nlength of approximately 200 psec where it is optically switched into the regen with the\ninjection Pockels Cell, at a repetition rate of 10 Hz. The extraction Pockels Cell timing is\nadjusted to extract the most stable pulse from the regen and this pulse (E = 2.5 mJ) is then\n\n6\n\n\ffurther amplified by the two linear amplifiers to 35 mJ and directed into the compressor.\nUpon exiting the compressor the pulse energy is 20 mJ and the pulse length is 8 psec\nFWHM. After exiting the CPA, this pulse is frequency tripled to \u03bb = 248 nm and E = 1 2 mJ, in the Tripler.\n\nUpon exiting the Tripler, the laser pulse passes through a variable telescope and is\nthen transported by a series of mirrors into the accelerator tunnel to an adjustable iris,\nabout 10 m after the Tripler. The adjustable iris is located just outside the vacuum, about\n1 m away from the photocathode surface, and is used to control the spot size on the\nphotocathode. After the nearly parallel beam passes through the iris, it is sent through a\nUV-quality quartz window and strikes a mirror in the vacuum chamber and is directed at\nnear normal incidence to the photocathode.\n\nTHE MODIFIED 3-SCREEN EMITTANCE MEASUREMENT METHOD\n\nThe standard 3-screen emittance measurement method is not adequate for measuring\nthe emittance of the beam directly out of the Drive Gun due to the strong space-charge\nforces involved in the transport of the beam. In the standard method, space-charge is\nimplicitly ignored and one determines the three transverse phase space unknowns (the\nbeam emittance (\u03b5), the beam beta function (\u03b2), and the beam envelope slope (\u03b1)) from\nthe 3 measured spot sizes (\u03c31, \u03c32, and \u03c33). However, when the space-charge cannot be\nignored, a modification to the standard method will be required.\n\n7\n\n\fA criteria to determine when it is appropriate to neglect space-charge can be obtain\nfrom the 1D beam (infinitely long, round beam) RMS envelope equation [4],\n\n\u03c3 \u2032\u2032(s ) + \u03ba 0 (s )\u03c3 (s ) \u2212\n\n\u03b52\n\n\u03c3 (s )\n\n3\n\n\u2212\n\nK\n\n4\u03c3 (s )\n\n=0\n\n(1)\n\nwhere s is the direction of propagation, the prime means the derivative is taken with\nrespect to s, \u03c3 is the RMS envelope or radius of the beam, \u03ba0(s) is the external focusing\nterm, \u03b5 is the unnormalized transverse emittance, and K is the space-charge parameter (or\ngeneralized perveance) which is given by K = 2 I (I 0 \u03b2 3\u03b3 3 ) where I is the peak current, I0\n= 17000 Amps is the electron characteristic current, and \u03b2 and \u03b3 are the usual relativistic\nfactors. The third term in Eq. 1 is called the emittance defocusing term while the fourth\nterm is called the space-charge defocusing term. If all three measurements of the beam\nsize are made in a drift (as is the case for the measurements described in this paper) we\ncan set \u03ba0(s)=0 and the evolution of the beam envelope is determined solely by the\nemittance and space-charge terms. If we define R as the ratio of the space-charge to the\nemittance terms we then have,\n\nK\u03c3 2\nR=\n4\u03b5 2\n\nThe standard 3-screen emittance measurement technique is used when the beam is\nemittance dominated; i.e. when this ratio is much less than one: R << 1.\n\n8\n\n(2)\n\n\fAccording to PARMELA simulations of the AWA Drive Gun, a Q = 1 nC, Energy =\n8 MeV beam, will have: \u03c3x,y ~ 1-3 mm, \u03b5norm ~ 1 \u03bcm, and I ~ 0.5 kAmp, which results in\nR ~ 20-150, clearly a space-charge dominated beam. Therefore, to extract the emittance\nfrom the spot size measurements we need to use a model of the beam envelope that\nincludes both space-charge and emittance; there are several ways to do this. In this\npaper, we will fit the beam envelope to the 3 spot size measurements with the 3D\nenvelope code TRACE 3-D [5]. Since there are 4 unknowns in Eq. 1 (the initial spot\nsize, \u03c3 ( s = 0) , and slope, \u03c3 \u2032( s = 0) , the emittance \u03b5 and generalized perveance K ) one\ncould imagine using a 4-screen emittance measurement technique to determine the 4\nunknowns. However, as we discuss below, we chose to assume that K is given correctly\nfrom PARMELA simulations.\n\n3. Experimental Measurements and Emittance Estimates\n\n3.1 Data Acquisition and Data Reduction\n\nBeam images were acquired at 3 locations in the drift region following the gun, (Fig.\n1: YAG-1, YAG-2, and YAG-3) with Sony analog CCD cameras fitted with manually\ncontrolled 60-300 mm zoom lenses and captured by an 8-bit PC-based Imaging\nTechnology frame grabber. The zoom lenses were instrumented with a remotely\ncontrollable aperture to insure that the images were not saturated and yet made full use of\nthe dynamic range of the imaging system. A user developed Matlab routine was used to\nextract spot sizes (\u03c3x and \u03c3y) from each of the captured beam images using the following\n\n9\n\n\fprocedure: (1) subtract off the dark current background from the image, and (2) fitting a\nGaussian curve to the projected beam profile. All spot sizes quoted in this paper are the\n'1-sigma' values of the fitted Gaussian.\n\nThe spatial resolution of the acquired images was estimated as follows. The\nhorizontal resolution of the image was 11.6 pixels/mm while the vertical resolution was\nabout 8.1 pixels/mm. (The difference in resolution for the two directions is due to the\nfact that the YAG screens are tilted at 450 which caused the horizontal axis to become\nelongated by\n\n2 .) In units of distance, and assuming we need a least 2 pixels to detect a\n\nchange in spot size, then the horizontal resolution is = (2 pixels)/(11.6 pixels/mm) = 0.09\nmm and the vertical resolution is 1/8.1 = 0.12 mm. (For simplicity of data analysis we\nuse 0.1 mm in both directions.) Since we need at least 10 pixels per 1-sigma of a\nGaussian beam to resolve the spot [6], this means that the minimum 1-sigma spot size\nthat can be resolved in the horizontal is 10/11.6 = 0.86 mm and in the vertical direction is\n10/8.6 = 1.2 mm.\n\nDuring the experiment, we attempted to hold all experimental parameters fixed except\nfor the rf gun phase, \u03c6gun, as shown in Table 1. However, due to the inherent shot-to-shot\njitter of the laser energy amplitude, the nominal charge, Q = 1 nC , was expected to\nfluctuate during the data taking process. And since charge jitter causes the spot size to\njitter, data analysis becomes difficult. On the other hand, we expect that beam charge and\nspot size to be closely correlated, assuming the other parameters remain fixed. Therefore,\nrather than acquiring a large number of images and averaging the results, we\n\n10\n\n\fimplemented a method for synchronized capturing of the beam image (as measured at the\nphosphor screens in Fig. 1: YAG-1, YAG-2, and YAG-3), and the value of charge (Fig.\n1.: ICT). Since the other parameters can be held constant rather easily, the synchronized\ndata taking procedure was expected to greatly reduce the measured spot size fluctuation\ndue to laser amplitude jitter.\n\nAfter setting the parameters to the values shown in Table 1, data was acquired by the\nfollowing procedure. (i) Make a quick sweep of the rf gun phase to determine the well\nunderstood charge vs. rf gun phase (Q vs. \u03c6gun) curve. From this curve, the approximate\nlocation of the zero phase point, 00, is found since it is the approximately the lowest\nphase point at which the extracted charge from the gun drops to zero. Once the zero\nphase point is found, increase \u03c6gun to approximately 300; (ii) Insert YAG-1 into the\nbeamline; (iii) Over approximately the next 20 shots of the machine, acquire the video\nimage at YAG-1, the charge at ICT, and the relative intensity of the laser pulse (measured\nat the exit of the laser Tripler); (iv) Repeat steps (ii) and (iii) for the other phosphor\nscreens (YAG-2 and YAG-3) with the same rf gun phase; (v) increase \u03c6gun by 100 and\nrepeat steps (i) \u2013 (iv). In summary, we measured the spot sizes at YAG-1, YAG-2, and\nYAG-3 for the rf gun phases \u03c6EXPT \u2245 300, 400, 500, 600, and 700. It should also be\nemphasized that the solenoids used for emittance compensation were not adjusted during\nthis entire run which means that the optimal (i.e. very low) emittances were not obtained\nsince the beam is not, in general, emittance compensated.\n\n11\n\n\fA typical data set (20 machine pulses acquired) of the spot size vs. charge is shown in\nFigure 2. Although our goal was to measure the spot size at Q = 1 nC, in general, there\nwere no events at precisely Q = 1 nC and some fitting is required. Due to laser amplitude\njitter as discussed above, we observed a large variation in the beam charge over the entire\nrange of data, from Qmin = 0.8 nC to Qmax = 1.6 nC, as well a large variation in the 1sigma Gaussian fitted spot size measured at YAG-1, from \u03c3min = 1.7 mm to \u03c3max = 2.7\nmm. Taken as they are, these large variations make data interpretation difficult.\nHowever, this variation can be reduced by using only spot sizes in a narrow charge\nwindow surrounding Q = 1 nC (Fig. 2a. 0.95 nC < Q < 1.05 nC). For this window, we\nobtained a significant reduction in the peak-to-peak spot size fluctuations, \u2206\u03c3p-p = 0.4\nmm. However, note that it is also possible to choose a narrow charge window that still\ncontains large spot size fluctuations (Fig. 2b). So, although the windowed data usually\ngave a marked improvement over the non-windowed data, the remaining variation in the\nspot size is not fully understood at present but investigations are underway.\n\nIn addition to the complication of spot size fluctuations, there were usually not\nenough data points in the window (e.g. there are only 3 data points in the charge window\nshown in Fig. 2a) to reliably obtain a mean. Therefore, a linear fit to the data was made\n(solid line in Fig. 2) and the value for the spot size was interpolated at Q = 1 nC. In the\ncase of Fig. 2, the spot size obtained at Q = 1 nC was \u03c3x = 1.97 mm. The measured\nhorizontal and vertical spot sizes (using the above procedure for the data reduction) for\nthe 3 different YAG screens and the 5 different phases are shown in Figure 3.\n\n12\n\n\f3.2 Comparison of the Measured Spot Sizes to the PARMELA Beam Envelope.\n\nIn this section, we compare the measured spot sizes to PARMELA predictions of the\nbeam size at the 3 YAG screens shown in Figure 1 using the machine and beam\nparameters listed in Table 1. Since the precise value of the rf gun phase is not known\nduring the experiment, the approximate values of the rf gun phases listed section 3.1 are\nreplaced with fitted values in this section. The fit was done by adjusting the rf gun phase\nin the PARMELA simulation until the envelope most closely matched the \u03c6EXPT \u2245 300\ndata points. The fit resulted in a small adjustment of 20 of rf phase so that the set of\nphases quoted above (300 to 700 ) are now replaced with the set (280 to 680).\n\nMeasured spot sizes and the PARMELA beam envelope are in reasonably good\nagreement in the drift region after the gun. For instance, by inspection of Figure 6a, one\ncan see that the PARMELA beam envelope for \u03c6PARM = 280 passes very closely to the\nthree \u03c3X data points for \u03c6EXPT = 280 (square symbols). However, a careful inspection of\ndata in Figure 6 reveals two systematic anomalies with the spots measured at YAG-1 (z =\n102 cm). First, the ratio of \u03c3Y to \u03c3X at the three screen locations have the average values\nof \u03c3Y/\u03c3X = 1.16, 1.02, and 1.00, respectively. This means that while the spots measured\nat YAG-2 and YAG-3 are essentially round, the spot measured at YAG-1 is elliptical.\nThe second anomaly is that the spot size measured at YAG-1 is systematically larger than\nthe predicted PARMELA envelope in both the horizontal and vertical plane, while it is\nwithin a few percent at YAG-2 and YAG-3. On average, the measured value of \u03c3X at\nYAG-1 is 16% higher than the predicted PARMELA beam envelope while the measured\n\n13\n\n\fvalue for \u03c3Y is 34% higher. Both of the systematic errors just described are believed to\nbe caused by the large dark-current background present at YAG-1 due to its close\nproximity to the Drive Gun. On the contrary, images captured at YAG-2 and YAG-3\nhave almost zero dark-current background, since they are located farther downstream,\nand thus it is easier to obtain an accurate spot size measurement. In the future, the\nproblem due to dark-current encountered at YAG-1 could be abated by using an OTR\n(optical transition radiation) screen and a gated camera to effectively gate out the dark\ncurrent.\n\n3.3 TRACE 3-D fit to the Data\n\nIn this section, we use the 3D beam envelope code, TRACE 3-D, to fit a beam\nenvelope to the spot sizes for the 5 different rf gun phases (Fig. 3) in order estimate the\nemittance. In the fit, the transverse phase space parameters in the horizontal (\u03b1x, \u03b2 x, and\n\u03b5 x) and vertical (\u03b1y, \u03b2 y, and \u03b5 y) directions are varied to obtain a best fit of the envelope\nto the data for each plane. The longitudinal parameters (bunch length, energy, and\nenergy spread) are taken from the PARMELA simulations and used as inputs to TRACE\n3-D. This is acceptable for two reasons: (i) previous measurements of the longitudinal\nparameters have been found to be in reasonable agreement with PARMELA predictions;\nand (ii) the transverse parameters are only weakly dependent on the longitudinal\nparameters in our range of interest. An additional simplification used in the fit is that\nTRACE 3-D only tracks the overall beam envelope, and not individual longitudinal\nslices, and therefore doesn't correctly model the evolution of the projected emittance.\n\n14\n\n\fLastly, the longitudinal parameters are approximated to be constant and equal to the\naveraged values of the PARMELA output in the drift region between YAG-1 at z = 102\ncm and YAG-3 at z = 375 cm. Since the simulations show that the longitudinal\nparameters only varied by a few percent in this interval a good fit is expected.\n\nThe beam envelope is fitted to the data in the following manner. If \u03c3i are the\nmeasured spot sizes and Ti are the TRACE 3-D fitted spot sizes at the three YAG screens,\nthen \u03c72 is defined as the sum of the square of the residuals, \u03c7 2 = \u2211i =1 (\u03c3 i \u2212 Ti ) .\n3\n\n2\n\nNormally, a best fit to the data is obtained by varying the three phase space unknowns {\u03b5,\n\u03b2, \u03b1} in TRACE 3-D until \u03c72 is minimized, and this is essentially our approach.\nHowever, it is more meaningful to find two sets of parameters (\u03b5, \u03b2, \u03b1) that both pass\nwithin the error bars of the data in order to obtain a lower and an upper estimate of\nemittance.\n\nAs a representative example of the quality of the TRACE 3-D fit to the data, we\nexamine the fit to the horizontal (x) data for \u03c6gun = 280 in some detail (Fig. 5). The error\nbars on the spot size measurements come from two factors, the resolution of the video\nsystem (which was shown to be +/- 0.1 mm in Section 3.1) and the spot size uncertainty\ndue to shot-to-shot fluctuations of the spot size (i.e. spot size jitter) as shown in Figure\n2b. This later fluctuation is difficult to estimate given the limited number of data points,\nbut the typical standard deviation of the spot sizes over the full charge range was\napproximately 0.3 mm. Therefore, adding these errors in quadruture gives the total error\nbars as approximately +/-0.3 mm (Fig 5: note that the origin has been shifted so that\n\n15\n\n\fYAG-1 is located a z = 0 cm.) As can be seen from the figure, there is a large emittance\nrange that fits the data for the case at \u03c6gun = 280. These fit results mean that the\nnormalized emittance is bounded between 1 \u03bcm and 13 \u03bcm for this case.\n\nThe range of the normalized r.m.s. emittance for all 5 values of the rf phase and for\nboth the horizontal and vertical planes is shown in Figure 6. Although the fit is\ntechnically consistent with the PARMELA prediction, its emittance resolution was poor;\ni.e. the quality of the emittance fit is poor since it only estimates the emittance to about an\norder of magnitude. A full explanation of why the emittance was not more tightly\nbounded is given in the next section, but is basically due to the fact that the beam is\nemittance dominated, i.e. a large value of R (Eq. 2) in the drift region.\n\n4. Discussion of Results\n\nOverall, agreement between the model predictions and the measured values were of\nmixed quality. On the positive, the measured beam spot sizes were in good agreement\nwith the predicted values from PARMELA, except at YAG-1 where the dark-current\nbackground limited the resolution of the measurement. However, the modified 3-screen\nemittance measurement method used in this paper proved unsatisfactory since its\nemittance resolution was poor. This result seems surprising at first since the envelope\nequation upon which TRACE 3-D is based includes both space-charge and emittance\neffects and was therefore expected to be useful in constraining the beam emittance.\nHowever, the reason that the 3-screen technique failed was due to a combination of the\n\n16\n\n\flarge space-charge dominated ratio of the beam, R, and the accuracy with which we can\nmeasure the spot sizes at YAG-1, YAG-2, and YAG-3. A sensitive measurement of the\nemittance should do two things: (i) produce a large change in the measured variable (spot\nsize in the 3-screen case) for a small change in emittance; and (ii) be able to measure the\nvariable (spot size) with high precision. But for the 3-screen measurement, in the case of\na heavily space-charge dominated beam, even large changes in emittance (e.g. a factor of\n2) did little to change the beam envelope (or spot size), as can be seen from Figure 5. For\nexample, when R = 300, as is typical for the beams measured in these experiments, then\nthe space-charge force is 300 times stronger than the emittance force. In other words, the\nevolution of the beam envelope is almost totally uninfluenced by the low value of the\nemittance. According to Eq. 2, the emittance would need to increase by a factor of\n\n300\n\n(or ~17) to reduce R to near 1 and emittance effects could be easily measured.\n\nWith the above explanation of the importance of R in mind, we can now understand\nthe variation of the emittance fit vs. phase shown in Figure 6. Inspection of Figure 6\nreveals that the normalized emittance is more tightly bound at the lowest (280) and\nhighest (680) values of the rf gun phase compared to the rf phase near the center (480).\nThis is due to the variation of the space-charge ratio, R, for each of the different rf phases,\nas is shown for two representative examples in Figure 7. At \u03c6gun = 280, the space-charge\nratio R has an average value of about 250 in the interval between YAG-1 and YAG-3,\nwhile at \u03c6gun = 480 this average value of R is about 1000. From the above discussion, we\nknow that the more heavily space-charge dominated a beam is, the less precision with\nwhich we can constrain the emittance. Therefore, since the space-charge ratio R is larger\n\n17\n\n\fat \u03c6gun = 480 than at \u03c6gun = 280 we expect that the 3-screen measurement to be less precise\nat \u03c6gun = 480 and this is exactly what was observed (Fig. 6).\n\n5. Conclusion\nTwo related measurements are reported on in this paper: (1) are compared to predictions\nfrom the beam dynamics code PARMELA; and (2) that uses a beam envelope model that\nincludes both space-charge and emittance effects. Both measurements were made for the\n1 nC, 8 MeV beam in the drift region directly following the rf photocathode gun.\n\nBeam dynamics studies were made for the space-charge dominated beam produced\nby the 1.5 cell, rf photocathode gun at the Argonne Wakefield Accelerator facility.\nMeasurements of the transverse beam envelope were made in the drift region located\nbetween 102 cm and 375 cm after the photocathode plane, for a beam with charge of 1\nnC, energy of 8 MeV, and a bunch length of 0.8 mm. The measurements of the beam\nenvelope in the drift were in reasonably good agreement with the PARMELA\npredictions. Investigations into the use of a modified 3-screen emittance measurement\nmethod using a model that includes both space-charge and emittance effects were made.\nHowever, because the beam was so heavily space-charge dominated (R>200) this\ntechnique did not have sufficient emittance resolution to constrain the emittance to within\na useful range. However, the modified 3-screen technique is still useful for measuring\nthe emittance of a beam that is not so space-charge dominated, say when R < 10. In the\nfuture, we plan to measure the emittance of this beam using both a standard pepper pot\ntechnique and an ODR-OTR based technique [7].\n\n18\n\n\f6.
