Supersymmetry must\nobviously be a broken symmetry. In order for broken supersymmetry to be effective in protecting the weak\nscale against large radiative corrections, the supersymmetric partners of the SM particles should have masses\nof the order of a few hundred GeV. Their discovery is one of the main goals of present and future accelerators.\nIn particular, a e+ e\u2212 linear collider with a high luminosity L = 500 fb\u22121 , and a center-of-mass energy of\n\u221a\ns = 500 GeV in the first stage, will be an important tool in determining the parameters of the low energy\nsupersymmetric model with a high precision [5\u20139]. Furthermore, polarization of the electron (and positron)\nbeam can enhance the capability of such a linear collider [10] in unravelling the structure of the underlying\nsupersymmetric model.\nIn the minimal supersymmetric standard model the fermionic partners of the two Higgs doublets (H1 , H2 )\nmix with the fermionic partners of the gauge bosons to produce four neutralino states \u03c7\u03030i , i = 1, 2, 3, 4, and two\nchargino states \u03c7\u0303\u00b1\nj , j = 1, 2. In the MSSM the lightest neutralino is favored to be the lightest supersymmetric\nparticle, and assuming, R-parity (Rp ) conservation, is absolutely stable. The neutralino states of the minimal\nsupersymmetric standard model with Rp conservation have been studied in great detail, because the lightest\nneutralino, being the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP), is the end product of any process involving\nsupersymmetric particle in the final state.\nThere are alternatives to the MSSM, an elegant one being the model with an additional chiral electroweak\ngauge singlet Higgs superfield S which couples to the two Higgs doublet superfields H1 and H2 via a dimensionless trilinear term \u03bbH1 H2 S in the superpotential. This model can solve the the \u03bc problem of the MSSM in\na natural manner. When the scalar component of the singlet superfield S obtains a vacuum expectation value,\na bilinear term \u03bbH1 H2 < S > involving the two Higgs doublets is naturally generated. Furthermore, when\nthis scalar component of the chiral singlet superfield S acquires a vacuum expectation value of the order of the\nSU (2)L \u00d7 U (1)Y breaking scale, it gives rise to an effective value of \u03bc (\u03bcef f \u2261 \u03bb < S >= \u03bbx) of the order of the\nelectroweak scale. However, the inclusion of the singlet superfield leads to additional trilinear superpotential\ncoupling (\u03ba/3)S 3 in the model, the so called nonminimal, or next-to-minimal [11\u201317], supersymmetric standard\nmodel (NMSSM). The absence of H1 H2 term, and the absence of tadpole and mass couplings, S and S 2 in\n\n\f2\nthe NMSSM is made natural by postulating a suitable discrete symmetry [18, 19]. The NMSSM is attractive on account of the simple resolution it offers to the \u03bc problem, and of the scale invariance of its classical\naction in the supersymmetric limit [20]. Since no dimensional supersymmetric parameters are present in the\nsuperpotential of NMSSM, it is the simplest supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model in which the\nelectroweak scale originates from the supersymmetry breaking scale only. Its enlarged Higgs sector may help in\nrelaxing the fine-tuning and little hierarchy problems of the MSSM, thereby opening new perspectives for the\nHiggs boson searches at high energy colliders [21, 22], and for dark matter searches [23]. In the nonminimal\nsupersymmetric standard model the mixing of fermionic partners of Higgs and gauge bosons [24\u201326] produces\nfive neutralino states \u03c7\u03030i , i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and two chargino states \u03c7\u0303\u00b1\nj , j = 1, 2. Furthermore, because of the\npresence of the fermionic partner of the singlet Higgs boson, the neutralino states can have an admixture of this\nSU (2)L \u00d7 U (1)Y singlet fermion, thereby affecting the phenomenology of the neutralinos in the nonminimal\nsupersymmetric standard model.\nThe lightest neutralino state (\u03c7\u030301 ) of MSSM or NMSSM, being typically the LSP, is stable and therefore, a\npossible dark matter candidate [27, 28]. Since the neutralinos are among the lightest particles in low energy\nsupersymmetric models, they are expected to be the first states to be produced at the colliding beam experiments. At an electron-positron collider, such as the International Linear Collider (ILC), the lightest neutralino\ncan be produced in pairs\ne+ + e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c7\u030301 + \u03c7\u030301 .\n\n(I.1)\n\nThis process proceeds via Z boson and selectron exchange [29, 30]. In collider experiments the lightest neutralino\nescapes detection. In such a situation the production of the lightest neutralino pair (I.1) is invisible. Therefore,\nwe must look for the signature of neutralinos in the radiative process\ne\u2212 + e+ \u2192 \u03c7\u030301 + \u03c7\u030301 + \u03b3.\n\n(I.2)\n\nDespite this process being suppressed by the square of the electromagnetic coupling, it might be the first process\nwhere the lightest supersymmetric states could be observed at the e+ e\u2212 colliders. The signal of the radiative\nprocess (I.2) is a single high energy photon with the missing energy carried away by the neutralinos. The\nprocess (I.2) has been studied in detail in the minimal supersymmetric standard model [31\u201341]. Some of these\nstudies underline the importance of longitudinal [39], and even transverse beam polarizations. On the other\nhand, the signature \"photon plus missing energy,\" that arises in the process (I.2) has been studied in detail by\ndifferent LEP collaborations [42\u201346]. Furthermore, the radiative neutrino process e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bd \u03bd\u0304\u03b3 in the SM is\nthe leading process with this signature, for which the cross section depends on the number N\u03bd of light neutrino\nspecies [47]. The LEP collaborations have found no deviations from the SM prediction, and, therefore, only\nbounds on the masses of supersymmetric particles have been set [42\u201344, 46]. For a review of the experimental\nsituation, see Ref. [48].\nMost of the theoretical studies on radiative neutralino production in the literature have been carried out in\nthe framework of the minimal supersymmetric standard model. This includes calculations relevant to ILC with\na high center-of-mass energy, high luminosity and longitudinally polarized beams, as well as study of the SM\nbackground from the radiative neutrino production\ne+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bd + \u03bd\u0304 + \u03b3,\n\n(I.3)\n\nand the supersymmetric background from radiative sneutrino production\ne+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bd\u0303 + \u03bd\u0303 \u2217 + \u03b3.\n\n(I.4)\n\nThe discovery potential of ILC may be significantly enhanced [49] if both beams are polarized, particularly if\nother SUSY states like heavier\nneutralino, chargino or even slepton pairs are too heavy to be produced at the\n\u221a\nfirst stage of the ILC at s = 500 GeV.\nIn a previous paper (referred to as paper I) we have carried out a detailed study of the radiative process (I.2) in\nthe nonminimal supersymmetric model and compared the predictions with those of the minimal supersymmetric\nstandard model [50]. This study was carried out for unpolarized electron and positron beams. In this paper\nwe continue this study and consider the radiative process (I.2) in the nonminimal supersymmetric standard\nmodel with polarized electron and positron beams to understand in detail if the signal can be enhanced by\nthe use of polarized beams. Furthermore, the SM background photons from radiative neutrino production\nprocess (I.3) with beam polarizations will have to be taken into account for a proper analysis of the radiative\nneutralino production process (I.2). Beam polarizations could enhance the signal photons for the process (I.2)\nfor NMSSM and reduce those from the SM background at the same time, which could lead to the enhancement\nof the statistics. We will also consider supersymmetric background photons from radiative sneutrino production\n\n\f3\nprocess (I.4) with polarized beams. This is important if sneutrino production is kinematically accessible and\nif the sneutrino decay is invisible. We will compare and contrast the results obtained for NMSSM with those\nfor the minimal supersymmetric standard model with polarized beams. This will include the signal for the\nradiative neutralino process, and the dependence of the cross sections on the parameters of the neutralino\nsector. This comparison will allow us to assess the feasibility of observing the radiative neutralino process for\nthe most popular low energy supersymmetric models at a e+ e\u2212 collider.\nThe plan of the paper is as follows. In Sec. II, we calculate the cross section for the signal process (I.2)\nin the nonminimal supersymmetric standard model, and compare it with the corresponding cross section in\nthe minimal supersymmtric standard model, for unpolarized and polarized electron and positron beams. In\norder to calculate the cross section in the NMSSM, we fix the parameter space that we use in our calculations.\nThis is done by using various theoretical and experimental constraints on the parameter space of NMSSM. In\nparticular, we constrain the values of the trilinear superpotential parameters \u03bb and \u03ba which enter the neutralino\nmass matrix of the NMSSM. We also describe the phase space for the signal process as well as the cuts on\noutgoing photon angle and energy that we use to regularize the infrared and collinear divergences in the tree\nlevel cross section. We then analyze numerically the dependence of the cross section on the parameters of the\nneutralino sector, and on the selectron masses, for unpolarized and polarized beams. Here we also calculate\nthe photon energy distribution for the radiative production of the second lightest neutralino in the NMSSM\nand compare it with the corresponding distribution for the lightest neutralino for unpolarized and polarized\nbeams, respectively.\nIn Sec. III we analyze the backgrounds to the radiative neutralino process (I.2) with polarized beams. This\nincludes the background from SM process (I.3), as well as from the supersymmetric process (I.4) for the case\nof polarized beams. In Sec. IV we study in detail the beam polarization dependence of the cross section for\nthe radiative neutralino production process as well as for the backgrounds processes. Here we also consider\nthe statistical significance for measuring the excess of photons from radiative neutralino production over the\nbackgrounds, and calculate this quantity for NMSSM, and compare it with the corresponding results in MSSM.\nWe summarize our results and conclusions in Sec. V. Our notations and results on the neutralino mass matrices\nand couplings are summarized in Appendix A.\nII.\n\nRADIATIVE NEUTRALINO PRODUCTION\n\nThe Feynman diagrams for the radiative process\ne\u2212 (p1 ) + e+ (p2 ) \u2192 \u03c7\u030301 (k1 ) + \u03c7\u030301 (k2 ) + \u03b3(q),\n\n(II.1)\n\nare shown in Fig. 1, where the symbols in the brackets denote the four momenta of the respective particles.\nIn NMSSM, and in MSSM, this process proceeds at the tree level via t- and u-channel exchange of right and\nleft selectrons \u1ebdR,L , and via Z boson exchange in the s channel. In order to calculate the cross section for\nthe radiative production of neutralinos we need to compute the couplings of the neutralinos to electrons, to\nthe scalar partners of electrons, the selectrons, and to Z 0 bosons. We summarize these couplings for MSSM\nand NMSSM [51, 52] in Appendix A. As can be seen in Appendix A, the couplings of the lightest neutralino\nare determined by the corresponding elements of the neutralino mixing matrix (Nij or Nij\u2032 ). For numerical\ncalculation of the radiative neutralino cross section in the MSSM, we have chosen to work with the parameters in\nthe Snowmass Points and Slopes (SPS 1a) scenario [53]. The parameters of the SPS 1a scenario are summarized\nin Table I. However, since in the SPS 1a scenario the value of the parameters \u03bc and M2 are fixed, we shall\nuse a different set of parameters to study the dependence of the neutralino mass and the radiative neutralino\nproduction cross section on \u03bc and M2 , and on the selectron masses. This set of parameters is shown in Table II.\nWe shall call this set of parameters as the MSSM electroweak symmetry breaking scenario (EWSB) [54]. As in\npaper I, for the NMSSM we use a set of parameters that is obtained by imposing theoretical and experimental\nconstraints on the parameter space of the NMSSM. The parameters that enter the neutralino mass matrix of\nthe NMSSM are, apart from M1 and M2 , tan \u03b2, \u03bc (\u2261 \u03bb < S >= \u03bbx), \u03bb and \u03ba. For M1 , M2 and M3 we use the\nvalues which are consistent with the usual GUT relation M1 /\u03b11 = M2 /\u03b12 = M3 /\u03b13 . We note that for the MSSM\nin SPS 1a scenario, the value of the parameter tan \u03b2 = 10. In order to remain close to the SPS 1a scenario of\nMSSM, we have chosen for our numerical calculations in NMSSM values of tan \u03b2 = 10, whereas the rest of the\nparameters are chosen in such a way that the lightest Higgs boson mass, the lightest neutralino mass and the\nlightest chargino mass satisfy the present experimental lower limits. We have also imposed on the parameter\nspace of NMSSM, the theoretical constraint that there is no charge and color breaking global minimum of the\nscalar potential, and that a Landau pole does not develop below the grand unified scale (MGUT \u2248 1016 GeV).\nThe consequence of imposing these constraints on the parameter space of NMSSM, and the resulting masses for\nvarious particles for a particular choice of input parameters is summarized in Table III.

The tree\nlevel cross sections have infrared and collinear divergences, which need to be regularized\u221a[33]. To do this we\ndefine the fraction of the beam energy carried by the photon as x = E\u03b3 /Ebeam, where s = 2Ebeam is the\ncenter of mass energy, and E\u03b3 is the energy carried away by the photon. We then impose the following cuts\non x, and on the scattering angle \u03b8\u03b3 of the photon [49]:\n0.02 \u2264 x \u2264 1 \u2212\n\nm2\u03c70\n\n,\n\n(II.6)\n\n\u22120.99 \u2264 cos \u03b8\u03b3 \u2264 0.99.\n\n(II.7)\n\n1\n\n2\nEbeam\n\nThe\n\u221a lower limit on x in (II.6) corresponds2 to a2 photon energy E\u03b3 = 5 GeV for the center of mass energy\ns = 500 GeV. The upper limit of (1 \u2212 m\u03c70 /Ebeam ) on x corresponds to the maximum energy that a photon\n1\ncan carry in radiative neutralino production.\nIn order to implement the cuts on the photon energy in the calculation of the cross sections, we have taken\nthe mass of the lightest neutralino in NMSSM to be m\u03c701 = 94 GeV for the parameter set shown in Table III.\nFor MSSM SPS1a, we take m\u03c701 = 97 GeV and for MSSM EWSB m\u03c701 = 108 GeV.\n\u221a\nWe note that for values of s = 500 GeV, and for m\u03c701 \u2265 94 GeV, this cut reduces a substantial amount of\nthe on-shell Z boson contribution to radiative neutrino production process.\n2.\n\n\u221a\nPhoton Energy (E\u03b3 ) Distribution and Total Beam Energy ( s) Dependence\n\nUsing the procedure described above, we have calculated the energy distribution of the photons from radiative\nneutralino production in NMSSM, in MSSM SPS 1a, and in MSSM EWSB for both unpolarized and polarized\nelectron and positron beams, respectively. These are shown in Fig. 4, where\n\u221a we compare the energy distribution\nof the photons in these models. In Fig. 5 we show the total beam energy s dependence of the cross sections for\nNMSSM, and for MSSM EWSB and MSSM SPS 1a, respectively. We note that the photon energy distribution\nand the total cross section for radiative neutralino production in NMSSM and in MSSM EWSB are very close\nto each other, and are smaller as compared to what one obtains in MSSM SPS 1a scenario.\n3.\n\nDependence on \u03bc and M2\n\nSince the neutralino mass matrix, and hence the lightest neutralino mass, depends on \u03bc and M2 , it is\nimportant to study the dependence of the radiative neutralino cross section on these parameters.

We\nhave, therefore, studied the cross section \u03c3(e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u030301 \u03b3) as a function of \u03bc and M2 independently. In Fig. 6\nwe show the \u03bc dependence of the total cross section for the radiative production of neutralinos for NMSSM\nas well as MSSM EWSB. We recall that in the MSSM SPS 1a scenario these parameters are fixed. As is\nseen from Fig. 6, the total cross section increases with \u03bc. The plot of total cross-section versus \u03bc in Fig. 6 is\nplotted in the range \u03bc \u2208 [120, 170] GeV in NMSSM and in MSSM EWSB. Note that the parameter values are\nchosen so as to avoid color and charge breaking minima, absence of Landau pole, and the phenomenological\nconstraints on different particle masses. Furthermore, in Fig. 7 we show the M2 dependence of the total cross\nsection for radiative neutralino production for NMSSM and MSSM EWSB. The total cross-section decreases\nwith increasing value of M2 . The graph of total cross-section versus M2 in Fig. 7 is plotted for the interval\nM2 \u2208 [150, 450] GeV in NMSSM and in MSSM EWSB so as to satisfy the theoretical and phenomenological\nconstraints described above.

In the NMSSM and MSSM EWSB, the selectron masses\nare independent parameters. In Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 we show the dependence of total cross section of radiative\nneutralino production on the left and right selectron masses. The cross section is not very sensitive to the\nselectron masses for both models. Furthermore, the total neutralino production cross section is smaller in\nNMSSM as compared to MSSM EWSB as a function of left as well as right selectron masses.

We shall also study the\nbeam polarization dependence of the background processes. The cross section with polarized e\u00b1 beams, with\npolarization Pe\u00b1 (|Pe\u00b1 | \u2264 1), can be written as\nX \u0010 1 + Pe\u2212 \u03bb \u0011\u0010 1 \u2212 Pe+ \u03bb \u0011\n\u03c3\u03bb ,\n(IV.1)\n\u03c3(Pe\u2212 , Pe+ ) = 2\n2\n2\n\u03bb\n\nwhere \u03c3\u03bb is the helicity dependent cross section, and where \u03bb is the helicity (\u03bb = \u00b11) of the initial particles (e\u00b1 ).\nThe signal radiative neutralino production cross section can be enhanced, and the background can be reduced\nby using a positively-polarized e\u2212 beam (Pe\u2212 > 0) and a negatively-polarized e+ beam (Pe+ < 0).\nIn the NMSSM, and MSSM, the radiative neutralino production process proceeds proceeds mainly via the\nexchange of right selectrons \u1ebdR . This is because, for the parameter choices that we use, the neutralino has a\nsignificant bino component in these models, and the coupling to the right selectron is significantly larger as\ncompared to the left selectrons \u1ebdL . This leads to the contribution from the right selectron exchange to the\ncross section which is an order of magnitude larger as compared to the left selectron exchange. Furthermore,\ncompared to the right selectron exchange, the the contribution from left selectron exchange is suppressed due\n\n\f14\nTABLE IV: Cross sections\n\u03c3, significance S, and signal to background ratio r for different beam polarizations (Pe\u2212 |Pe+ )\n\u221a\nfor MSSM SPS 1a at s = 350 GeV, with tan \u03b2 = 10 and L = 500 fb\u22121 .\n(Pe\u2212 |Pe+ )\n+ \u2212\n\u03c3(e e \u2192 \u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u030301 \u03b3)\n+ \u2212\n\u03c3(e e \u2192 \u03bd \u03bd\u0304\u03b3)\nS\nr\n\n(0|0)\n20 fb\n\n(0.8|0) (0.8| \u2212 0.3) (0.8| \u2212 0.6) (0.9|0) (0.9| \u2212 0.3) (0.9| \u2212 0.6)\n35 fb\n\n46 fb\n\n56.4 fb\n\n37 fb\n\n48.4 fb\n\n60 fb\n\n2991 fb 793 fb\n8\n27\n0.7% 4.4%\n\n685 fb\n38\n6.7%\n\n579 fb\n50\n9.7%\n\n518 fb\n35\n7.1%\n\n501 fb\n46\n9.6%\n\n484 fb\n57.5\n12.4%\n\nTABLE V: Cross sections\n\u221a \u03c3, significance S, and signal to background ratio r for different beam polarizations (Pe\u2212 |Pe+ )\nfor MSSM SPS 1a at s = 500 GeV, with tan \u03b2 = 10 and L = 500 fb\u22121 .\n(Pe\u2212 |Pe+ )\n\n\u03c3(e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u030301 \u03b3)\n+ \u2212\n\n\u03c3(e e \u2192 \u03bd \u03bd\u0304\u03b3)\nS\nr\n\n(0|0)\n23 fb\n\n(0.8|0) (0.8| \u2212 0.3) (0.8| \u2212 0.6) (0.9|0) (0.9| \u2212 0.3) (0.9| \u2212 0.6)\n40 fb\n\n52 fb\n\n64 fb\n\n42 fb\n\n55 fb\n\n67 fb\n\n2942 fb 597 fb\n9.4\n35.4\n0.8% 6.7%\n\n423 fb\n53.3\n12.3%\n\n250 fb\n80.8\n25.6%\n\n304 fb\n50.5\n13.8%\n\n218 fb\n74.4\n25.2%\n\n133 fb\n106\n50.4%\n\nTABLE VI: Cross sections\n\u03c3, significance S, and signal to background ratio r for different beam polarizations (Pe\u2212 |Pe+ )\n\u221a\nfor MSSM SPS 1a at s = 650 GeV, with tan \u03b2 = 10 and L = 500 fb\u22121 .\n(Pe\u2212 |Pe+ )\n+ \u2212\n\u03c3(e e \u2192 \u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u030301 \u03b3)\n+ \u2212\n\u03c3(e e \u2192 \u03bd \u03bd\u0304\u03b3)\nS\nr\n\n(0|0)\n18 fb\n\n(0.8|0) (0.8| \u2212 0.3) (0.8| \u2212 0.6) (0.9|0) (0.9| \u2212 0.3) (0.9| \u2212 0.6)\n32 fb\n\n42 fb\n\n52 fb\n\n34 fb\n\n44 fb\n\n55 fb\n\n2869 fb 578 fb\n7.5\n29\n0.63% 5.5%\n\n408 fb\n44\n10.3%\n\n237 fb\n68\n22%\n\n292 fb\n42\n11.6%\n\n207 fb\n62\n21.3%\n\n123 fb\n92\n44.7%\n\nto the fact that m\u1ebdR < m\u1ebdL . We also note that the Z boson exchange contribution to the neutralino production\nprocess is negligible in these models. The SM background radiative neutrino process proceeds mainly via the\nexchange of W bosons. This means that positive electron beam polarization Pe\u2212 and negative positron beam\npolarization Pe+ will enhance the signal cross section, and at the same time reduce the background [39]. We\nnote that |Pe\u2212 | > 0.8 and |Pe+ | > 0.5 are designed at the International Linear Collider [65].\nA quantitative measure of the excess of photons from the radiative neutralino production over the SM\nbackground photons is the theoretical significance defined as\n\u221a\nNS\n\u03c3S\nS = p\nL,\n= \u221a\n\u03c3S + \u03c3B\n(NS + NB )\n\n(IV.2)\n\nwhere NS and NB define the number of signal and background events, respectively, \u03c3S and \u03c3B are the respective\ncross sections, and L is the integrated luminosity. If the theoretical significance has a value S = 1 for a signal,\nthen that signal can be measured at a 68% confidence level. In addition, we must also consider the signal to\nbackground ratio\nr =\n\n\u03c3S\n.\n\u03c3B\n\n(IV.3)\n\nFor a signal to be detectable at the International Linear Collider we must have S > 1 and r > 1% . These\nestimates are expected to be rough estimates which will enable us to decide whether an excess of signal photons\ncan be measured over the background photons. A detailed Monte Carlo analysis is beyond the scope of the\npresent paper.\nWe have studied the radiative\nproduction of lightest neutralino for three different electron-positron center\n\u221a\nof mass energies, namely s = 350 GeV, 500 GeV, and 650 GeV, respectively with longitudinally polarized\nbeams for the three models-MSSM SPS1a, MSSM EWSB and NMSSM using CALCHEP. For MSSM SPS\n1a, we have calculated the beam polarization dependence of the signal cross section \u03c3(e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u030301 \u03b3) and\n\n\f15\n\u221a\nthe background cross section \u03c3(e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bd \u03bd\u0304\u03b3), the significance S and signal to background ratio r at s = 350\nGeV, 500 GeV and 650 GeV for the input parameters as in Table I. We report the values of cross-sections\n\u03c3(e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u030301 \u03b3) and \u03c3(e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bd \u03bd\u0304\u03b3), S and r for a specific set of beam of polarizations (Pe\u2212 |Pe+ ) = (0|0),\n(0.8|0), (0.8| \u2212 0.3), (0.8| \u2212 0.6), (0.9|0), (0.9| \u2212 0.3), and (0.9| \u2212 0.6) in Tables IV, V, and VI, respectively. We\nobserve that there is a large enhancement in the value of S \u221a\n= 106 and r = 50.4% for (Pe\u2212 |Pe+ ) = (0.9| \u2212 0.6)\ncompared to all other chosen set of polarization values for s = 500 GeV. For a previous study of the beam\npolarization effects for the radiative neutralino production in MSSM, see Ref. [66].\nSimilarly, in the Tables VII, VIII, and IX, we discuss the values of cross-sections \u03c3(e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u030301 \u03b3) and\n\u03c3(e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bd \u03bd\u0304\u03b3), S and r for a specific set of beam polarization values (Pe\u2212 |Pe+ ) = (0|0), (0.8|0), (0.8| \u2212 0.3),\n(0.8| \u2212 0.6), (0.9|0), (0.9| \u2212 0.3), and (0.9| \u2212 0.6) for the case of MSSM EWSB. There is again a significant\nincrease for\u221athe value of S = 12.5 and r = 5% for (Pe\u2212 |Pe+ ) = (0.9|\u22120.6) compared to other chosen polarization\nvalues for s = 500 GeV. However, the enhancement is relatively samll as compared to the MSSM SPS 1a\nscenario.\nFinally, in Tables X, XI, XII, we show the results for the case of NMSSM. We get the similar pattern but\nthe value of S = 7 and r = 2.8% for (Pe\u2212 |Pe+\u221a) = (0.9| \u2212 0.6) is considerably smaller as compared to that of\nS = 106 and r = 50.4% in MSSM SPS 1a at s = 500 GeV. Thus, if the radiative production of neutralinos\nis observed at a linear collider with polarized beams, then on the basis of the observed event rate it may be\npossible to distinguish between MSSM and NMSSM as the underlying low energy supersymmetric model.\nV.\n\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nThe nonminimal supersymmetric standard model (NMSSM) solves \u03bc problem of MSSM in an elegant manner\nand is, thus, an attractive alternative to the MSSM. We have carried out a detailed study of the radiative\nneutralino production process e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u030301 \u03b3 in NMSSM for ILC energies, and compared the results with the\ncorresponding results in the MSSM for both unpolarized and polarized e\u2212 and e+ beams. This process has\na signature of a high energy photon and missing energy. We have obtained a typical set of parameter values\nfor the NMSSM by imposing theoretical and experimental constraints on the parameter space of NMSSM. For\nthe set of parameter values that we obtain in this manner, the lightest neutralino in NMSSM has a significant\nadmixture of the fermionic component of the singlet chiral superfield S. Using this parameter set, we have\nstudied in detail the radiative neutralino production cross section in NMSSM for the ILC energies for both\nunpolarized and polarized e\u2212 and e+ beams. For comparison with MSSM, we have used the MSSM SPS 1a\nand MSSM EWSB models. The background to this process comes from the SM process e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bd \u03bd\u0304\u03b3, as well\nas the background from the supersymmetric process e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bd\u0303 \u03bd\u0303 \u2217 \u03b3. All these processes have a signature of\na highly energetic photon with missing energy. The photon energy distribution d\u03c3/dE\u03b3 , and the total cross\nsection\n\u221a as a function of the total energy have been calculated for the NMSSM and for MSSM SPS 1a scenario\nat s = 500 GeV using CALCHEP package. Because of the admixture of a singlet in the lightest neutralino,\nthe cross section as a function of energy for the radiative neutralino production is lower in NMSSM than in\nMSSM. We have also studied the dependence of the cross section for radiative neutralino production on the\nSU (2)L gaugino mass parameter M2 and the Higgs(ino) mass parameter \u03bc, as well as its dependence on the\nselectron (\u1ebdR , \u1ebdL ) masses in NMSSM, and compared it with the corresponding results in MSSM. In order to\nquantify whether an excess of signal photons, NS , can be measured over the background photons,\nNB , from\n\u221a\nradiative neutrino production, we have analyzed the theoretical statistical significance S = NS / NS + NB . At\nthe ILC, electron and positron beam polarizations can be used to significantly enhance the signal and suppress\nthe background simultaneously. We have shown that the significance can then be increased almost by an order\nof magnitude, e.g. with (Pe\u2212 , Pe+ ) = (0.8, \u22120.6) compared to (Pe\u2212 , Pe+ ) = (0, 0). A possible\n\u221a feed-back of\nILC500 results could motivate the immediate use of the low-luminosity option of the ILC at s = 650 GeV in\n\nTABLE VII: Cross sections\n\u03c3, significance S, and signal to background ratio r for different beam polarizations (Pe\u2212 |Pe+ )\n\u221a\nfor MSSM EWSB at s = 350 GeV, with tan \u03b2 = 10 and L = 500 fb\u22121 .\n(Pe\u2212 |Pe+ )\n+ \u2212\n\u03c3(e e \u2192 \u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u030301 \u03b3)\n+ \u2212\n\u03c3(e e \u2192 \u03bd \u03bd\u0304\u03b3)\nS\nr\n\n(0|0)\n1.7 fb\n\n(0.8|0) (0.8| \u2212 0.3) (0.8| \u2212 0.6) (0.9|0) (0.9| \u2212 0.3) (0.9| \u2212 0.6)\n2.9 fb\n\n3.8 fb\n\n4.7 fb\n\n3.1 fb\n\n4 fb\n\n4.9 fb\n\n2991 fb 793 fb\n0.7\n2.3\n0.06% 0.4%\n\n685 fb\n3.2\n0.56%\n\n579 fb\n4.3\n0.81%\n\n518 fb\n3\n0.6%\n\n501 fb\n4\n0.8%\n\n484 fb\n5\n1.02%\n\n\f16\nTABLE VIII: Cross sections \u03c3,\n\u221a significance S, and signal to background ratio r for different beam polarizations\n(Pe\u2212 |Pe+ ) for MSSM EWSB at s = 500 GeV, with tan \u03b2 = 10 and L = 500 fb\u22121 .\n(Pe\u2212 |Pe+ )\n+ \u2212\n\u03c3(e e \u2192 \u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u030301 \u03b3)\n+ \u2212\n\u03c3(e e \u2192 \u03bd \u03bd\u0304\u03b3)\nS\nr\n\n(0|0)\n2.2 fb\n\n(0.8|0) (0.8| \u2212 0.3) (0.8| \u2212 0.6) (0.9|0) (0.9| \u2212 0.3) (0.9| \u2212 0.6)\n3.9 fb\n\n5.1 fb\n\n6.3 fb\n\n4.1 fb\n\n5.4 fb\n\n6.6 fb\n\n2942 fb 597 fb\n0.9\n3.6\n0.075% 0.65%\n\n423 fb\n5.5\n1.2%\n\n250 fb\n8.8\n2.5%\n\n804 fb\n5.2\n1.3%\n\n218 fb\n8\n2.5%\n\n133 fb\n12.5\n5%\n\nTABLE IX: Cross sections\n\u03c3, significance S, and signal to background ratio r for different beam polarizations (Pe\u2212 |Pe+ )\n\u221a\nfor MSSM EWSB at s = 650 GeV, with tan \u03b2 = 10 and L = 500 fb\u22121 .\n(Pe\u2212 |Pe+ )\n\n(0|0)\n\n\u03c3(e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u030301 \u03b3) 1.9 fb\n+ \u2212\n\n\u03c3(e e \u2192 \u03bd \u03bd\u0304\u03b3)\nS\nr\n\n(0.8|0) (0.8| \u2212 0.3) (0.8| \u2212 0.6) (0.9|0) (0.9| \u2212 0.3) (0.9| \u2212 0.6)\n3.4 fb\n\n4.4 fb\n\n5.4 fb\n\n3.5 fb\n\n4.6 fb\n\n5.7 fb\n\n2869 fb 578 fb\n0.8\n3\n0.06% 0.6%\n\n408 fb\n4.8\n1%\n\n237 fb\n7.7\n2.3%\n\n292 fb\n4.5\n1.2%\n\n207 fb\n7\n2.2%\n\n123 fb\n11\n4.6%\n\nTABLE X: Cross\n\u221a sections \u03c3, significance S, and signal to background ratio r for different beam polarizations (Pe\u2212 |Pe+ )\nfor NMSSM at s = 350 GeV, with tan \u03b2 = 10 and L = 500 fb\u22121 .\n(Pe\u2212 |Pe+ )\n+ \u2212\n\u03c3(e e \u2192 \u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u030301 \u03b3)\n+ \u2212\n\u03c3(e e \u2192 \u03bd \u03bd\u0304\u03b3)\nS\nr\n\n(0|0)\n1.1 fb\n\n(0.8|0) (0.8| \u2212 0.3) (0.8| \u2212 0.6) (0.9|0) (0.9| \u2212 0.3) (0.9| \u2212 0.6)\n2 fb\n\n2991 fb 793 fb\n0.45\n1.6\n0.04% 0.25%\n\n2.6 fb\n\n3.2 fb\n\n2.1 fb\n\n2.7 fb\n\n3.3 fb\n\n685 fb\n2.2\n0.4%\n\n579 fb\n3\n0.55%\n\n518 fb\n2\n0.4%\n\n501 fb\n2.7\n0.54%\n\n484 fb\n3.3\n0.68%\n\nTABLE XI: Cross\n\u221a sections \u03c3, significance S, and signal to background ratio r for different beam polarizations (Pe\u2212 |Pe+ )\nfor NMSSM at s = 500 GeV, with tan \u03b2 = 10 and L = 500 fb\u22121 .\n(Pe\u2212 |Pe+ )\n\n(0|0)\n\n\u03c3(e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u030301 \u03b3) 1.2 fb\n\u03c3(e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03bd \u03bd\u0304\u03b3)\nS\nr\n\n(0.8|0) (0.8| \u2212 0.3) (0.8| \u2212 0.6) (0.9|0) (0.9| \u2212 0.3) (0.9| \u2212 0.6)\n2.2 fb\n\n2.8 fb\n\n3.5 fb\n\n2.3 fb\n\n3 fb\n\n3.7 fb\n\n2942 fb 597 fb\n0.5\n2\n0.04% 0.4%\n\n423 fb\n3\n0.66%\n\n250 fb\n5\n1.4%\n\n804 fb\n3\n0.76%\n\n218 fb\n4.5\n1.4%\n\n133 fb\n7\n2.8%\n\nTABLE XII: Cross\n\u221a sections \u03c3, significance S, and signal to background ratio r for different beam polarizations (Pe\u2212 |Pe+ )\nfor NMSSM at s = 650 GeV, with tan \u03b2 = 10 and L = 500 fb\u22121 .\n(Pe\u2212 |Pe+ )\n\n\u03c3(e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03c7\u030301 \u03c7\u030301 \u03b3)\n+ \u2212\n\n\u03c3(e e \u2192 \u03bd \u03bd\u0304\u03b3)\nS\nr\n\n(0|0)\n1 fb\n\n(0.8|0) (0.8| \u2212 0.3) (0.8| \u2212 0.6) (0.9|0) (0.9| \u2212 0.3) (0.9| \u2212 0.6)\n1.8 fb\n\n2.3 fb\n\n2.8 fb\n\n1.9 fb\n\n2.4 fb\n\n3 fb\n\n2869 fb 578 fb\n0.42\n1.7\n0.03% 0.3%\n\n408 fb\n2.5\n0.56%\n\n237 fb\n4\n1.2%\n\n292 fb\n2.5\n0.65%\n\n207 fb\n3.7\n1.16%\n\n123 fb\n6\n2.44%\n\norder to resolve model ambiguities between NMSSM and MSSM even at an early stage of the experiment and\noutline future search strategies at the upgraded ILC at 1 TeV.

These couplings can be obtained from the neutralino\nmixing matrix. To obtain the neutralino mixing matrix for the MSSM, we recall that the neutralino mass\nmatrix obtains contributions from part of the MSSM superpotential\nWMSSM = \u03bcH1 H2 ,\n\n(A.1)\n\nwhere H1 and H2 are the two Higgs doublet chiral superfields, and \u03bc is the supersymmetric Higgs(ino) parameter. In addition to the contribution from the superpotential, the neutralino mass matrix receives contributions\nfrom the interactions between gauge and matter multiplets, as well as contributions from the soft supersymmetry breaking masses for the gauginos. Including all these contributions, the neutralino mass matrix, in the\n1\n2\nbino, wino, higgsino basis (\u2212i\u03bb\u2032 , \u2212i\u03bb3 , \u03c8H\n, \u03c8H\n) can be written as [51, 52]\n1\n2\nMMSSM\n\n\uf8f6\nM1\n0\n\u2212mZ sin \u03b8w cos \u03b2\nmZ sin \u03b8w sin \u03b2\n0\nM2\nmZ cos \u03b8w cos \u03b2 \u2212mZ cos \u03b8w sin \u03b2 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n=\uf8ed\n\uf8f8,\n\u2212mZ sin \u03b8w cos \u03b2 mZ cos \u03b8w cos \u03b2\n0\n\u2212\u03bc\nmZ sin \u03b8w sin \u03b2 \u2212mZ cos \u03b8w sin \u03b2\n\u2212\u03bc\n0\n\uf8eb\n\n(A.2)\n\nwhere M1 and M2 are the U (1)Y and the SU (2)L soft supersymmetry breaking gaugino mass parameters,\nrespectively, and tan \u03b2 = v2 /v1 is the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the neutral components of\nthe two Higgs doublet fields H1 and H2 , respectively. Furthermore, mZ is the Z boson mass, and \u03b8w is the\nweak mixing angle. We shall assume that all the parameters in the matrix M are real, in which case M is\na real symmetric matrix and can be diagonalised by an orthogonal matrix. If one of the eigenvalues of M is\nnegative, one can diagonalize this matrix using a unitary matrix N , the neutralino mixing matrix, to get a\npositive diagonal matrix [51]:\n\u0001\n(A.3)\nN \u2217 MMSSM N \u22121 = diag m\u03c701 , m\u03c702 , m\u03c703 , m\u03c704 .\n\nwhere m\u03c70i (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) are neutralino masses arranged in order of increasing value.\nFor the NMSSM, the relevant part of the superpotential is\nWNMSSM = \u03bbSH1 H2 \u2212\n\n\u03ba 3\nS ,\n3\n\n(A.4)\n\n1\n2\nwhere S is the Higgs singlet chiral superfield. In the basis (\u2212i\u03bb\u2032 , \u2212i\u03bb3 , \u03c8H\n, \u03c8H\n, \u03c8S ), the neutralino mass\n1\n2\nmatrix for the NMSSM can then be written as [24, 25]\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nM1\n0\n\u2212mZ sin \u03b8w cos \u03b2\nmZ sin \u03b8w sin \u03b2\n0\n0\nM2\nmZ cos \u03b8w cos \u03b2 \u2212mZ cos \u03b8w sin \u03b2\n0 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n0\n\u2212\u03bbx\n\u2212\u03bbv2 \uf8f7 ,\nMNMSSM = \uf8ec\u2212mZ sin \u03b8w cos \u03b2 mZ cos \u03b8w cos \u03b2\n(A.5)\n\uf8ed m sin \u03b8 sin \u03b2 \u2212m cos \u03b8 sin \u03b2\n\u2212\u03bbx\n0\n\u2212\u03bbv1 \uf8f8\nZ\nw\nZ\nw\n0\n0\n\u2212\u03bbv2\n\u2212\u03bbv1\n2\u03bax\n\nwhere < S >= x is the vacuum expectation value of the singlet Higgs field.
