Introduction\nMagnesium sulphide is a wide-spread dust component in dust\nforming stars with carbon rich element mixture. Since Mg and\nS are abundant elements, this dust species forms a major component in the dust mixture injected by dying AGB stars to the\ninterstellar medium. Any attempt to model the dust production\nby AGB stars and their contribution to the interstellar dust population requires a knowledge of the production mechanisms at\nleast of the abundant dust species. Since for MgS a condensation\nmodel for this species is presently lacking, we try to develop in\nthis paper such a model. We will explain, why we believe that\nMgS condenses in stellar outflows as a mantle on SiC grains.\nMagnesium sulphide was detected as dust component in circumstellar dust shells enshrouding some carbon stars and in the\nenvironment of two planetary nebulae by Forrest et al. (1981)\nby observing a broad and prominent emission band in the farinfrared spectrum which apparently is centred around 30 \u03bcm. At\nthe instant of its detection the nature of the carrier of this emission band was not immediately clear, except that the feature can\nonly be a solid state absorption band. Goebel & Moseley (1985)\nproposed MgS as carrier of this feature. MgS has an infrared\nabsorption feature just in the wavelength region of the newly detected feature and chemical equilibrium condensation calculations of Lattimer et al. (1978) for carbon rich element mixtures,\noriginally performed for identifying possible supernova condensates, had shown that MgS should be an abundant solid phase\nat temperatures of the order of 600 K or lower. A companion\npaper to the paper of Goebel & Moseley (1985) by Nuth et al.\n(1985) showed newly determined optical properties of a number\nof solid phases, MgS, CaS, FeS, SiS2 , FeS2 , and Fe3 C, that could\nbe responsible for the 30 \u03bcm band and which were compared\nto observations in the paper of Goebel & Moseley. Though the\nmatch between the observed feature and the absorption band of\nSend offprint requests to: H.-P. Gail\n\nMgS was not perfect, the identification of MgS as carrier of the\n30 \u03bcm band has been widely accepted since that time, though\nother interpretations are occasionally discussed (e.g. Papoular\n2000; Grishko et al. 2001; Volk et al. 2002).\nIn order to allow to include a calculation of the MgS emission feature in model calculations of radiative transfer in circumstellar dust shells, and thus to enable a quantitative comparison\nbetween observations and theory, Begemann et al. (1994) determined optical constants of Mg x Fe1\u2212x S (0.9 \u2265 x \u2265 0). They obtained good agreement between the observed emission band profile and the calculated spectrum in the 30 \u03bcm region for a radiative transfer model of the circumstellar dust shell of IRC+10216,\nwhich left little doubt with respect to the interpretation of the\n30\u03bcm emission band as being due to MgS.\nA number of observational and theoretical studies of the\n30 \u03bcm emission from dust enshrouded AGB and post-AGB stars,\nand from the environment of planetary nebulae appeared since\nthat time (e.g. Omont 1993; Omont et al. 1995; Yamamura et al.\n1998; Jiang et al. 1999; Szczerba et al. 1999; Hrivnak et al. 2000;\nHony et al. 2002; Volk et al. 2002; Hony & Bouwmann 2004;\nLagadek et al. 2006; Zijlstra et al. 2006; Leisenring et al. 2008).\nGood examples for the emission band can be found in Hony et\nal. (2002), Volk et al. (2002) for galactic objects and Lagadek\net al. (2006) and Zijlstra et al. (2006) for the Magellanic clouds.\nThey all show unequivocally that MgS formation is a common\nphenomenon for carbon stars on the tip of the AGB.\nThe formation mechanism of this MgS is not clear. It is already speculated in the first papers by Nuth et al. (1985) and\nGoebel et al. (1985) that MgS forms via a surface reaction on\ncarbon grains and this scenario was favoured over MgS condensation as a separate dust species. A labory investigation on\nMgS condensation was conducted by Kimura et al. (2005), but\nthis gives no direct insight in the formation process. No further\ndiscussion of this problem seems to have appeared in the astrophysical literature so far. In this paper we will show that MgS can\n\n\fSvitlana Zhukovska and Hans-Peter Gail: Condensation of MgS in outflows from carbon stars\n-2\n\n2000\n\n10\n\n1800\n\n10\n\nTiC\n\n-8\n\nAlN\n\nFe\nCaS\n\n1000\n\nMgS\n\n800\n600\n\nSiC2\n\n-10\n\n10\n\n-12\n\n10\n\n-14\n\n10\n\nSiO\n\nSi2C\n\nS2\n\nCS\n\nSi H2S\n\nmagnesium sulphide\n\nT [K]\n\n1200\n\nSiC\n\nCa\n\n-6\n\n10\n\n1400\n\nMg\n\nSiS\n\n10\ncarbon\n\nCmolecules\n\n1600\n\nC2H2\n\n-4\n\nsilicon carbide\n\n2\n\n-16\n\n10\n\nCaS\n-18\n\nstellar wind\n\n10\n\n400\n-12\n-11\n-10\n-9\n-8\n-7\n-6\n-5\n-4\n-3\n-2\n10 10 10\n10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10\n\nP [bar]\n\nFig. 1.

The kinetics of dust particle growth\nin a stellar outflow is discussed in Sect. 3. The results of some\nmodel calculations for MgS condensation in stellar winds are\npresented in Sect. 4 and the optical properties of grains formed\nby MgS grown on a silicon carbide or carbon core are briefly\ndiscussed in Sect. 5. Our final conclusions are presented in Sect.\n6.\n\n2. Stability of sulphur compounds\nWe start with a brief discussion of the equilibrium chemistry of\nsulphur compounds in a carbon rich element mixture. Figure 1\nshows the results of a calculation of the chemical equilibrium\ncomposition of an element mixture with cosmic element abundances (e.g. Grevesse & Sauval1 1998) with carbon abundance\nset to 1.2 times the oxygen abundance. The lines in this P-T diagram correspond to the upper stability limits of the indicated\nsolid phases. For comparison we also show the wind trajectory\nof a stationary dust-driven wind model for the outflow from a\ncarbon star. In unconditional chemical equilibrium also some\noxygen bearing condensed phases would exist at temperatures\nbelow 800 K (cf. Lattimer et al. 1978). The oxygen for their formation has to come from a reduction of CO. It is unlikely that\nsuch reactions are kinetically possible and we assumed here that\nthe oxygen is completely blocked in CO which does not react\nwith other species in the system, i.e., we consider a conditional\nchemical equilibrium where O is arrested in CO2 .\n1\nWe prefer these over the more recent data of Asplund et al. (2005)\nsince the reduction of the C and O abundances in the new table are in\nclear contradiction to the results of helioseismology (e.g. Chaplin et al.\n2007)\n2\nSome condensation temperatures then are somewhat different from\nthe results of more conventional condensation calculations\n\n-20\n\n10\n\n1600\n\n1400\n\n1200\n\n1000\n\n800\n\n600\n\nT [K]\n\nFig. 2. Concentrations in the gas phase of S, Si, and Mg atoms\nand their abundant molecular compounds with H, C, O, and S\nfor a cooling sequence with P = 10\u221210 bar if formation of solid\nSiC in chemical equilibrium is allowed for (full lines) and if the\nformation of SiC is suppressed (dashed lines)\n\nFrom the abundant elements with abundances relative to H\nexceeding 10\u22126 , only CaS and MgS are formed as solid sulphur\nbearing phases in chemical equilibrium. Troilite (FeS), that is\nabundant in oxygen rich environments, is not formed in the carbon rich environment because MgS is more stable than FeS, and\nin a carbon rich environment the Mg is not consumed by the\neven more stable magnesium silicates as in the oxygen rich case.\nThe first sulphur bearing solid compound that appears in a cooling sequence at pressure 10\u221210 bar is CaS at about 950 K, followed by MgS at about 750 K. The temperatures where CaS and\nMgS become stable in a stellar outflow depend somewhat on the\nmass-loss rate and are of the just mentioned order of magnitude\nfor a mass-loss rate of \u1e40 = 10\u22125 M\u2299 yr\u22121 or somewhat less for\nsmaller values of \u1e40.\nCalcium sulphide may be formed in a carbon rich environment prior to MgS condensation, but because of the low calcium\nabundance (which is only 1/17 of the Mg abundance) it would\nbe difficult to detect this dust component in infrared spectra from\ncircumstellar dust shells in the presence of MgS dust. The formation of CaS cannot consume all the S since the sulphur abundance is about eight times the Ca abundance, i.e., MgS is formed\nadditionally to CaS at lower temperatures. Since the Mg abundance is about twice that of the S abundance, at most half of the\navailable Mg can be consumed by the formation of MgS. The\nremaining fraction of Mg stays in the gas phase and may or may\nnot precipitate later on other condensed phases.\nThe abundance of S bearing molecules in the gas phase is\nshown in Fig. 2 for a cooling sequence with total pressure 10\u221210\nbar that is representative for the pressure in the dust formation\nzone of a stellar wind (cf. Fig. 1). The figure shows the composition of the gas phase in a restricted chemical equilibrium where\ncarbon is not completely condensed into solid carbon, a situation encountered in an outflow, where carbon formation cannot\nkeep pace with cooling and only part of the carbon is converted\nfrom gaseous species into the condensed phase. Results for the\nsulphur chemistry are shown for the two cases that (i) the Si condenses into silicon carbide (SiC) at temperatures below about\n1250 K and (ii) for the case that formation of SiC is suppressed.\nA comparison of the results for both cases shows:\n\n\fSvitlana Zhukovska and Hans-Peter Gail: Condensation of MgS in outflows from carbon stars\n\n\u2013 If no SiC is formed, the sulphur is almost completely bound\nin SiS below 1500 K and no other S bearing species are abundant in the gas phase.\n\u2013 Only if the Si is consumed by the formation of solid SiC, the\nsulphur is liberated and forms increasing amounts of other\nS-bearing molecules \u2013 in particular H2 S \u2013 in pace with conversion of Si from SiS into silicon carbide.\nThis means that the sulphur chemistry of the gas phase and the\nformation of S-baring solid phases are strongly coupled to the\nprocess of silicon carbide condensation.\nAs long as not much solid silicon carbide has formed the\nsulphur is blocked in the rather stable SiS molecules and the\nformation of MgS from abundant gas phase species requires the\nfollowing reaction\nk1\n\nSiS + Mg \u2212\u2192 MgS(s) + Si .\n\n(1)\n\nThe change of free enthalpy by this reaction is \u2206G1 =\n\u221230 kJ/mol at 800 K (thermochemical data are from Chase\n1998). After the consumption of SiS by silicon carbide formation and formation of abundant H2 S the following reaction becomes possible\nk2\n\nH2 S + Mg \u2212\u2192 MgS(s) + H2 .\n\n(2)\n\nThe change of free enthalpy in this case is \u2206G2 = \u2212350 kJ/mol.\nThe corresponding laws of mass action for these two chemical\nreactions are\naMgS(s) pSi = pSiS pMg e\u2212\u2206G1 /RT\naMgS(s) pH2 = pH2 S pMg e\n\n\u2212\u2206G2 /RT\n\n(3)\n(4)\n\nwhere aMgS(s) is the activity of solid MgS. In chemical equilibrium the activity of the solid compound equals unity. These\nequations determine the equlibrium pressure in Sect. 3.2.\n\n3. Formation of MgS in a stellar wind\nIn stellar outflows temperature and density variations occur on\nshorter timescales than particle growth. In this case condensation proceeds far from chemical equilibrium and particle growth\nhas to be treated by reaction kinetics. We consider here the conditions under which MgS condensation may occur in a rapidly\nexpanding stellar outflow.\n3.1. The wind model\n3.1.1. Stationary wind model\n\nThe formation of MgS in stellar outflows from AGB stars seems\nto be associated with late phases of AGB evolution of low and intermediate mass stars, where the mass-loss rate is very high and\nthe stars have lost already most of their hydrogen rich envelope.\nAt the tip of the AGB, radiation pressure on dust becomes the dominating driving source of the wind. The underlying stars seem all to be variables, either Miras or LPVs.\nThe structure of the outflow is complicated in this case, since\nthere are always several shocks running outwards, which are\nsuperposed on the average outflow of stellar material. This is\ndemonstrated by several model calculations of dust forming stellar outflows of pulsating stars (e.g. Bowen 1988; Fleischer et\nal. 1991, 1992; Feuchtinger et al. 1993; H\u00f6fner & Dorfi 1997;\nH\u00f6fner et al. 1998; Winters et al. 1997, 2000; Jeong et al. 2003).\n\n3\n\nCalculating dust formation rates for multi-component dust\nmixtures of stars with quite different elemental compositions\nand widely varying stellar parameters presently seems not to\nbe possible for reasons of computational time requirements if\nthe shock structure of the wind is to be taken into account. For\nthe purpose of calculating the composition of the dust mixture\nand the amount of dust formed in the outflows of AGB-stars we\nuse a more simple model, which assumes a stationary outflow. If\none compares the velocity and density profiles of such stationary winds with published models of dust forming pulsators (e.g.\nWinters et al. 2000; Jeong et al. 2003), one observes in most\ncases a strong resemblance of the average velocity and density\nprofiles with that of the stationary models, except that in the pulsation models outwards propagating shocks are superposed on\nthe average flow structure. So we can hope to obtain at least an\nestimate of the average quantities of dust formed in the outflow\nif dust formation is calculated for such an average outflow structure. One important consequence of this neglect of the detailed\nstructure of the flow is that we cannot determine self-consistently\nthe mass-loss rate \u1e40. We have to treat this as a free parameter,\nwhich has to be fixed in some other way.\n3.1.2. Stellar parameters\n\nThe central star is assumed to be on the tip of the AGB. Its luminosity then is typically L\u2217 = 1.5 \u00d7 104 L\u2299 .\nFor stars forming MgS in their outflow a rather high metallicity is required since at low metallicities the abundances of Mg\nand S would be too low for this to be possible. Only a small\nfraction of the carbon stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud, for\ninstance, seem to form MgS dust (Sloan et al. 2006), while for\ncarbon stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud the formation of\nMgS seems to be more common (Zijlstra et al. 2006), and in the\nMilky Way it is quite common for highly evolved carbon stars\n(e.g. Hony 2002). We note already at this place that according\nto observations MgS formation seems to be associated with SiC\nformation: Stars showing the MgS feature also show the SiC feature, but not all stars showing a SiC feature also show the MgS\nfeature in their spectra (e.g. Zijlstra 2006). In order that low and\nintermediate mass stars of Pop I (or not much lower) metallicity\nbecome carbon stars, their initial masses must be from the mass\nrange between about 1.5 M\u2299 and about 4 M\u2299 .\nAfter massive mass-loss on the AGB the stellar mass is likely\nto be already substantially reduced and we assume in the model\ncalculation a fixed stellar mass of 1 M\u2299 . The stellar radiation is\napproximated by a black body spectrum. The effective temperature (in the inter-pulse phase) is determined from the relation\nlog T eff = .234 log M \u2212 .2 log L \u2212 .116 log\n\nZ\n+ 4.146\n0.02\n\n(5)\n\ngiven by Vassiliadis & Wood (1993) for stars on the AGB. The\nmass M and luminosity L are in solar units. With the assumed\nstellar parameters and solar metallicity one finds T eff = 2 250 K.\nThe mass-loss rate is estimated from the relation\n\u1e40 = 2.1 \u00d7 10\u22128\n\nL\nv\u221e\n\n(6)\n\ngiven by Vassiliadis & Wood (1993) for stars in the superwind\nphase. The luminosity is in units of L\u2299 , the outflow velocity v\u221e\nin km s\u22121 , and the mass-loss rate in units of M\u2299 yr\u22121 . With the\nestimated stellar parameters and a typical outflow velocity in the\nsuperwind phase of 10 . . . 15 km s\u22121 one obtains a mass-loss rate\nof about \u1e40 = 2 . . . 3 \u00d7 10\u22125 M\u2299 yr\u22121 for stars at the end of their\n\n\f4\n\nSvitlana Zhukovska and Hans-Peter Gail: Condensation of MgS in outflows from carbon stars\n\nAGB evolution. A value of \u1e40 = 3 \u00d7 10\u22125 M\u2299 yr\u22121 is used in the\nmodel calculations.\nA typical run of density and temperature in a stationary stellar wind model of a carbon star calculated for a dust driven stationary wind model (cf. Gail & Sedlmayr 1986, 1987 for the\ndetails of how such models are constructed) is shown in Fig. 1.\nThe C/O abundance ratio of the outflowing material in any\ncase exceeds unity since MgS is not formed in an oxygen rich\nenvironment.\n\nTable 1.

Dust particle growth\n\nThe model calculation of condensation in the outflow from a carbon star considers the following dust components: Carbon dust,\nsilicon carbide dust, and iron dust. The formation of these dust\nspecies is calculated as outlined in Ferrarotti & Gail (2006). Here\nwe add the growth of magnesium sulphide to our model. The\ndust formation is calculated by solving the equations for dust\ngrowth (e.g. Gail 2003)\ns\ns\n\uf8f1\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nkT g \uf8f4\npeq (T d ) T d \uf8f4\nda\n\uf8f2\n\uf8fd\n= V0 \u03b1 ngr\n\u03a6(w) \u2212\n(7)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\uf8fe\ndt\n2\u03c0mgr\nngr kT d\nTg \uf8f4\n\nfor all species of interest.

Conditions for grain growth\n\nSome insight into the origin of the difficulty to explain how MgS\nforms in the outflow can be gained from considering a simplified\ngrowth model. We neglect in the growth equation (i) the vaporisation and (ii) the consumption of the growth species by grain\ngrowth. Additionally we use in the expression for the thermal\nvelocity a representative value for the temperature in the growth\nzone of the dust. The first neglect is generally not too bad for dust\ngrowth problems since the vapour pressure peq usually rapidly\ndecreases with decreasing temperature below the stability limit\nof a solid. The second neglect restricts the applicability of our\nconsiderations to the early growth phase before the gas phase\nbecomes exhausted of condensable material. This initial growth\nphase is that which we now consider.\nThe particle density ngr is the least abundant gas phase\nspecies involved in the rate determining reaction for the growth.\nIts abundance is usually some fraction g of the least abundant element from which this gas phase species is composed of. In our\ncase, where reaction (2) is assumed to be the key reaction for\nMgS growth, the least abundant growth species is H2 S and sulphur is the least abundant of the elements forming this molecule.\nWe write ngr = g\u01ebel NH , where NH is the number density of H nuclei which can be calculated from the mass density \u03c1 of the wind\n\n(9)\n\nwhere Ad is the atomic weight of the chemical formula unit and\n\u033ad the bulk density of the condensate.\nThe growth equation has to be complemented by an equation\nfor the consumption of the growth species from the gas phase.\nThe details are described in the paper by Ferrarotti & Gail (2006)\nand are not repeated here.\nAs rate determining step for the formation of MgS via reaction (2) we assume the addition of a H2 S molecule from the gas\nphase since this is the least abundant of the molecules involved\nin the reaction. peq in Eq. (7) is calculated from from Eq. (4)\nwith activity aMgS = 1. The thermodynamic data for calculating\n\u2206G are taken from JANAF-tables (Chase 1998).\nThe growth coefficient \u03b1, the probability that a collision is\nfollowed by a growth step, seems not to be known. For the similar solid MgO with the same structure and similar bonding properties Hashimoto (1990) measured a growth coefficient of about\n0.2 and we will use the same value for MgS.\n\nvalue\n\nNH =\n\n\u03c1\n.\n(1 + 4\u01ebHe )mH\n\n(10)\n\nThe mass density is given in a stationary outflow with mass-loss\nrate \u1e40 and outflow velocity v by\n\u03c1=\n\n\u1e40\n.\n4\u03c0r2 v\n\n(11)\n\nSince condensation of MgS becomes possible only at a temperature much lower than the condensation temperature of carbon dust, the radiation pressure on carbon dust has driven the\noutflow velocity already nearly to the terminal outflow velocity of the stellar wind if MgS condensation commences. For the\nproblem of MgS condensation we can consider the wind velocity\nv therefore to be constant. By changing the independent variable\nt to r by means of vdt = dr we can write the equation for the\ninitial growth of dust as\nda\n\u1e40\n.\n= V0 \u03b1 vgr\ndr\n1.4mH 4\u03c0r2 v2\n\n(12)\n\n\fSvitlana Zhukovska and Hans-Peter Gail: Condensation of MgS in outflows from carbon stars\n\nHere vgr is the thermal velocity of the growth species (assumed\nto be constant). Integrating from the inner radius Rd of the onset\nof growth of the considered dust species to infinity we obtain\na\u221e = a0 + V0 \u03b1 vgr g\u01ebel\n\n\u1e40\n,\n1.4mH 4\u03c0Rd v2\n\n(13)\n\nwhere a0 is the radius of the seed nuclei for dust growth and a\u221e\nthe radius at infinity. This equation requires that the grain radius\na\u221e remains smaller than the maximum radius amax attained if\nall condensable material is condensed. This maximum possible\nradius is given by\nV0 \u01ebkey\n4\u03c0 3\n.\na \u01ebd =\n3 max\n\u03bdkey\n\n(14)\n\nHere \u01ebd is the number of dust grains per hydrogen nucleus, \u01ebkey\nthe key element for the formation of the dust species considered,\nand \u03bdkey the number of atoms of the key element in the chemical\nformula of the solid.\nWe can now write\na\u221e = a0 + amax\n\n\u1e40\n\u1e40cr\n\n(15)\n\nwith\namax 1.4mH 4\u03c0Rd v2\n\u1e40cr =\n.\nV0 \u03b1 vgr g\u01ebel\n\n(16)\n\nThe quantity \u1e40cr defines a critical mass-loss rate for particle\ngrowth. If the mass-loss rate \u1e40 of the stellar outflow is lower\nthan \u1e40cr , the final particle radius of dust grains of the considered\nkind in the outflow is smaller than the maximum radius attained\nin case of complete condensation. Condensation by growth starting with some kind of small seed particles is always incomplete\nin this case and most of the condensable material remains in the\ngas phase. If, however, the mass-loss rate \u1e40 of the stellar outflow is of the order of \u1e40cr or exceeds \u1e40cr , the final particle radius\nin the outflow approaches amax ; complete condensation is possible in this case by growth starting with some kind of small seed\nparticles (at least this is not kinetically forbidden).\nApplying this to MgS condensation we obtain\n\u1e40cr,MgS = 5.4 \u00d7 10\u22124 M\u2299 yr\u22121 .\n\n(17)\n\nHere we assumed a typical outflow velocity of v = 10 km s\u22121\nand a radius of Rd = 2 \u00d7 1014 cm corresponding to about 5 stellar\nradii. As key element for MgS condensation we assume sulphur\nsince it has lower abundance than Mg. The growth species is\nH2 S. As typical temperature for calculating vgr we choose 600 K.\nAll other quantities are given in Table 1. The critical mass-loss\nrate is about a factor of ten higher than the highest mass-loss\nrates observed for highly evolved AGB stars (e.g. van Loon et al.\n1999). As a result the radius can approach at most 1/10 of that\nfor complete condensation and only about 1/1000 of the condensable material can be condensed into MgS grains if the dust\ngrains start their growth for instance from seed particles with\nsizes of the order of 1 nm that are typical sizes for seed particles\nresulting from nucleation from the gas phase.\nFor such a low fraction of condensation of S and Mg into\nMgS this dust component would not be detectable in the infrared\nemission from circumstellar dust shells of AGB stars. Since MgS\nis frequently observed in highly evolved AGB stars, it cannot be\nformed by condensation from the gas phase via nucleation and\nsubsequent growth. We need therefore to look for some other\nkind of formation mechanism.\n\n5\n\n3.4. Heterogeneous growth\n\nThe most promising alternative is heterogeneous growth on\nsome other kind of dust particles that have already not-too-small\nradii at the onset of MgS growth in order that the frequency of\ncollisions of such a particle with growth species from the gas\nphase is high already from the beginning on. We derive the condition for this type of growth to occur by considering the initial\ngrowth phase, where the growth of a coating of MgS on some\ntype of carrier grain has not yet significantly increased the total\ngrain radius.\nWe use essentially the same type of simplifications as before\nand consider the following equation for the increase of the volume V of the coating on the surface of carrier grains of radius ac\ndV\n= V0 \u03b1vgr ngr 4\u03c0a2c .\ndt\n\n(18)\n\nIntroducing again r as independent variable we obtain upon integrating this equation from the radius Rd of the onset of formation\nof the coating to infinity\nV\u221e = V0 \u03b1vgr 4\u03c0a2c g\u01ebel\n\n\u1e40\n.\n1.4mH 4\u03c0Rd v2\n\n(19)\n\nThis is the final volume of the coating at large distances. The\nmaximum possible volume Vmax of the coating on a carrier dust\ngrain is, again, given by Eq. (14). We can now write\nV\u221e = Vmax\n\n\u1e40\n,\n\u1e40het\n\n(20)\n\nwhere\n\u1e40het =\n\n\u01ebkey 1.4 mH Rd v2\n\u03bdkey \u01ebd \u03b1vgr a2c g\u01ebel\n\n(21)\n\nis a characteristic mass-loss rate of the stellar outflow for formation of coatings on the surface of already existing grains. If the\nmass-loss rate \u1e40 of the stellar outflow is less than the characteristic mass-loss rate \u1e40het only part of the condensable material\nwill condense in form of a coating on the surface on some carrier grains. If the mass-loss rate \u1e40 of the stellar outflow exceeds\nthe characteristic mass-loss rate \u1e40het the volume of the coating\napproaches the maximum possible volume and complete condensation is possible, at least in principle.\nInserting numerical values for MgS condensation and assuming that the carrier grains for the formation of the coating\nhave a radius of ac = 0.1 \u03bcm one obtains\n!2\n\u22124 0.1 \u03bcm\nM\u2299 yr\u22121 .\n(22)\n\u1e40het = 2.8 \u00d7 10\nac\nThis characteristic mass-loss rate, again, is about a factor of ten\nhigher than the highest mass-loss rates observed for AGB stars,\nbut since it now refers to the volume we have the result, that\nat the end of the AGB evolution up to about 10% of the condensable material for MgS formation can really be condensed as\ncoating on suited carrier grains, if such exist. If the core grains\nhave a bigger radius than the assumed 0.1 \u03bcm, or if the massloss rate should be exceptionally high the fraction of condensed\nmaterial may be even bigger. Such amounts of condensed MgS\nshould be clearly visible in the infrared spectrum.\nHence, we come to the conclusion that the observed MgS in\nthe outflows from carbon stars on the AGB does not form as a\nseparate dust species but condenses as coating on the surface on\n\n\f6\n\nSvitlana Zhukovska and Hans-Peter Gail: Condensation of MgS in outflows from carbon stars\n0.030\nMgS mantle\n\nMgS on seeds\n\n0.025\n\nMgS mantle delayed\n\na [\u03bcm]\n\n0.020\n0.015\n0.010\n0.005\n\nCaS core delayed\nCaS core\n1\n\n10\n\n100\nR/RO\u2022\n\n1000\n\n10000\n\nFig. 3.

This restricts the possibilities, which dust species may serve\nas substrates of MgS growth, to the most abundant dust species.\nThe outflowing gas enters the temperature regime below\nabout 650 K favourable for MgS condensation with two major\ndust species that have grown farther inside in the shell to the required size: SiC grains and carbon grains. From investigations of\npresolar dust grains it is known that from the many poly-types of\nSiC only two are formed in circumstellar environments (Daulton\net al. 2003): The cubic 3C poly-type (usually denoted as \u03b2-SiC)\nis found in 79.4 % of all observed grains, and the hexagonal 2H\npoly-type (usually denoted as \u03b1-SiC) is found in 2.7 % of all\nobserved grains. In 17.1 % of all grains the material is an intergrowth of these two poly-types.\nThe lattice structure of the SiC grains in stellar outflows,\nthus, in most cases is cubic. Magnesium sulphide also has cubic lattice structure. The electronegativity difference (cf. Pauling\n1960) of MgS is 1.3 and that of SiC is 0.7. Both compounds\ntherefore show a significant ionic contribution to their bonding.\nThere are obvious similarities of structure and bonding properties of SiC and MgS. On the other hand, no such similarity exists\nbetween MgS and solid carbon. This suggests that SiC is much\nbetter suited as substrate for MgS precipitation than carbon. We\npropose therefore that MgS grows on SiC grains.\nA possible core grain is any compound that has a lattice structure similar to the MgS crystalline structure and a\nhigher condensation temperature. Among the compounds possibly formed in the stellar outflows also CaS satisfies both conditions. It has a crystal structure, that is the closest to that of\nMgS and becomes stable at a more than 200 K higher temperature than MgS (Fig. 1). The abundance of Ca in a stellar wind,\nhowever, is 16 times lower than the Mg abundance, which is\nnot very favourable for its role as core grain for MgS growth.\nNevertheless, we will also check this possibility.\n\n0.00\n1\n\n10\n\n100\nR/RO\u2022\n\n1000\n\n10000\n\nFig. 4.

The formation of significant amounts of MgS dust requires mass-loss rates of at least a\nfew times 10\u22125 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , i.e., this is possible only during the superwind phase short before termination of AGB evolution if the\nmass-loss rates have grown to very high values. This is just what\none seems to observe.\nAs a side-remark we note the following: Since the available\namount of S does not suffice for the formation of thick coatings\nof MgS such that the final volume is much bigger than the volume of the carrier grains, the volume of condensed material on\nthe surface of the carrier grains increases quadratically with the\nradius of the carrier grains (cf. Eq. 19). Therefore it may well\nbe that most of the MgS is concentrated on a sub-population of\nlager-than-the-average grains, if one has a broad distribution of\ngrain sizes for the possible carrier grains.\n3.5. Possible carrier grains\n\nThe dust species that may serve as carrier grains for MgS formation need to form dust grains with a size not much smaller than\n\n4. Models with core-mantle grains\nWe performed model calculations of dust formation in stellar\noutflows according to the wind model described in Sect. 3 to\ncheck the assumption of the core-mantle growth scenario of MgS\nformation. Grain growth is calculated as described in Sect. 3.2.\nFirst we check the model of MgS condensation on tiny seed\nnuclei. The existence of such seeds of 1 nm is taken for granted\nand the growth of MgS is calculated. This results in grain sizes\nof only about 0.02 \u03bcm and a very low fraction of Mg bound in\ndust, the condensation degree, of about 0.01. This is in line with\nour analytical findings in Sect. 3.3. The evolution of grain radius\nand condensation degree for this kind of model are shown in\nFig. 3 and Fig. 5, respectively. The small amount of condensed\nMgS found in this case is obviously not enough to explain the\nobserved 30 \u03bcm emission in the spectra of carbon stars, underlining, again, the need for a core-mantle growth mechanism of\nMgS formation.\nNext we check an alternative growth scenario for MgS formation, in which first CaS condenses on seed nuclei by the analogue of reaction (2), and then MgS grows as a mantle on this\ncore. The model calculations show that the size of CaS grains is\nmuch smaller than the required radius of 0.1 \u03bcm. We also tested\nthe case, that MgS condensation is delayed by imposing the additional condition for the growth rate Jgr,MgS \u2265 3Jgr,CaS to gain\nadditional time for CaS core growth in order to get bigger grains.\nThis artificial delay results, indeed, in bigger CaS cores, but also\n\n\fSvitlana Zhukovska and Hans-Peter Gail: Condensation of MgS in outflows from carbon stars\n0.25\n\n0.14\non SiC core\n\n0.12\n\n0.20\n0.10\nabs\n\n0.15\nC\u03bb\n\nCondensation degree fMg\n\n7\n\n0.10\n\n0.08\n0.06\n0.04\n\n0.05\n0.02\non seeds\n0\n\n0\n1\n\n10\n\n100\nR/RO\u2022\n\n1000\n\n10000\n\nFig. 5. Evolution of condensation degree of Mg with distance\nfrom the centre of the star for condensation of MgS (i) as mantle\non top of a SiC core and (ii) on seed particles (solid and dashed\nline, respectively).\nthis does not help to increase the final size of the MgS mantle. The results of these calculations of the evolution of the MgS\ngrain radius with distance from the centre of a star for normal\nand delayed condensation on CaS are also shown in Fig. 3. The\nfigure shows that the condensation of MgS on a CaS core results in almost the same grain radius as the growth of MgS on\nseeds grains. Both these formation mechanisms can not provide\nthe amount of MgS dust that is observed to condense in stellar\noutflows.\nSiC grain growth, however, commences at higher temperature and proceeds faster than CaS growth, so that at the onset of\nMgS formation the SiC core radius reaches \u221d 0.07 \u03bcm as shown\nin Fig. 4. The results of MgS condensation on tiny seed nuclei\nare shown in Fig. 4 for comparison. The SiC core is big enough\nto allow the formation of a considerable thickness of the MgS\ncoating, of order 0.02 \u03bcm, which results in a final grain size of\n0.9 \u03bcm. This value is very close to the required grain sizes to explain the shape of the extinction feature in the spectra of carbon\nstars. We assume in the calculation that SiC grains do not grow\nanymore as soon as the formation of the MgS mantle begins.\nFigure 4 show that growth of SiC grain with and without termination due to MgS mantle formation does not change the grain\nsize very much. Thus, a model with MgS mantle formation on\nSiC does not change noticeably the fraction of Si condensed in\nSiC dust, but results in a much higher value of the degree of condensation of Mg in MgS as compared to the case of growth on\nseeds. This is illustrated in Fig. 5.\nA similar test calculations for MgS coating formation on\ncarbon grains also gave sufficient thicknesses of MgS layers.\nBasically, condensation of MgS on carbon cores cannot be excluded, but from a physical point of view, MgS mantle formation\nis more likely on a SiC core, since the bond lengths and bonding\nproperties of SiC are similar to that of MgS. Laboratory experiments would be necessary to arrive at a final conclusion about\nthe carriers of MgS mantles.\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n35\n\u03bb [\u03bcm]\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\nFig. 6.

Optical properties of grains with SiC core and\nMgS mantle\n\nHere rc is the core radius, rm the thickness of the mantle and \u01eb1\nand \u01eb2 are the complex dielectric functions of the core and mantle material, respectively. x is the size parameter 2\u03c0(rc + rm )/\u03bb.\nThe small particle approximation x \u226a 1 is valid in our case\nsince we are interested in wavelengths from the region from 10\nto 40 \u03bcm that are much bigger than the size of circumstellar dust\nparticles.\nOptical constants for MgS are taken from Begemann et al.\n(1994) for Mg x Fe1\u2212x S with x = 0.9. For carbon we use data for\nthe BE carbon dust of the evaluation of the data of Colangeli\net al. (1993) by Zubko et al. (1996). For SiC we used the data\nfor SiC from Laor & Draine (1993). Extinction efficiencies have\nbeen calculated for SiC grains coated with MgS mantles and, for\ncomparison, also for carbon grains with MgS mantles.\nFigure 6 shows results for grains of total radius rc + rm\nof 0.1 \u03bcm and mantle thicknesses between 0 and 0.1 \u03bcm, i.e.,\nfor grains ranging in composition from pure SiC to pure MgS\ngrains. The results show the rather broad MgS absorption band\ncentred around about 26 \u03bcm, which in itself shows some structure. Additionally there appears a secondary peak centred around\n\u2248 33 . . . 38 \u03bcm for not too big mantle thicknesses. Its position\ndepends on the size ratio of core and mantle. This feature is not\npresent in the extinction efficiencies of MgS or SiC and results\nfrom the particular run of the complex dielectric functions of the\ncore and the coating in this wavelength region4 .\n\nIn order to study the difference of optical properties of grains\nwith coatings of MgS either on a SiC core or on a carbon core\n\n4\nIt has been checked if this results from a Fr\u00f6hlich mode in coated\nparticles at a frequency where the denominator in Eq. (24) vanishes, cf.\n\n\f8\n\nSvitlana Zhukovska and Hans-Peter Gail: Condensation of MgS in outflows from carbon stars\nC\u03bbabs\n\ncore of MgS grains, if the presence of MgS is indicated by its\nabsorption band around 26 \u03bcm. Observationally it was found by\nVolk et al. (2002) that the so called '30 \u03bcm feature' of carbon\nstars shows in some cases some structure and seems to consist\nof two overlapping features at 26 \u03bcm and 33\u03bcm. Our results for\nthe extinction of SiC-core-MgS-mantle grains indicate, that one\njust sees that the MgS in outflows from carbon stars grows as\nmantle on silicon carbide cores. If it is not seen this probably\ndoes not mean that in this case MgS precipitates on carbon, but\nmerely that the feature is not sufficiently well defined to be unambiguously be detectable.\n\n0.25\n0.20\n0.15\n0.10\n0.05\n0 10\n\n15 20\n25 30\n35 40\n\u03bb [\u03bcm]\n45 50\n\n0.8\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n1\n\n0.6\nrm / (rc+rm)\n\nC\u03bbabs\n0.14\n0.12\n0.10\n0.08\n0.06\n0.04\n0.02\n0 10\n\n15 20\n25 30\n35 40\n\u03bb [\u03bcm]\n45 50\n\n0.8\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n1\n\n0.6\nrm / (rc+rm)\n\nFig. 7. Wavelength variation of the absorption efficiency C\u03bbabs of\nspherical grains with SiC (top) or carbon (bottom) core and MgS\nmantle with total radius of 0.1 \u03bcm. The MgS mantles range in\nthickness from zero to unity in steps of 0.05 for the ratio of mantle thickness rm to total radius rc +rm , where rm is the core radius.\nThe extinction properties vary from that of pure SiC or carbon\ngrains to that of pure MgS grains. An extra extinction feature\ncentred on 33 \u03bcm for MgS grains with SiC core shows up at\nmoderate mantle thickness. This is missing in case of carbon\ncores.\nFigure 7 shows the variation of the extinction coefficient with\nvarying core to mantle size ratios \u2013 both for MgS grains with\nSiC and with carbon core \u2013 in a different representation and an\nextended wavelength region that also covers the 11 \u03bcm feature\nof SiC. The total grain radius rc + rm , again, is 0.1 \u03bcm and the\nfraction rm /(rc + rm ) is varied between 0 and 1. In the upper part\nof the picture one recognises how the SiC feature disappears and\nthe MgS feature appears as the composition of the grain varies\nfrom pure SiC to pure MgS. The extra feature peaking at about\n33 . . . 38 \u03bcm, depending on the mantle thickness, is clearly seen\nin case of coatings of moderate, but not too small fraction of the\ntotal size. For thick coatings the extra feature disappears together\nwith the 11 \u03bcm feature from the SiC core. The feature is not very\ndistinct and will probably hardly be detectable in many cases.\nThe particular feature peaking at about 33 . . . 38 \u03bcm is missing in the extinction of carbon grains coated with MgS, as can\nbe seen from the lower part of Fig. 7, because of the completely\ndifferent properties of the dielectric function. Therefore this extra feature can be considered as an indicator of a silicon carbide\nthe discussion of this effect in Bohren & Huffman (1983), but this seems\nnot to be the case\n\n6. Concluding remarks\nIn this paper the mechanism of MgS formation in stellar outflows\nof AGB stars is studied. From some elementary considerations\non the kinetics of MgS condensation we estimate a critical massloss rate of about 5 \u00d7 10\u22124 M\u2299 yr\u22121 for efficient MgS formation\nif this would condense as a separate dust species via nucleation\nand subsequent growth. This value of the mass-loss rate is much\nhigher than any observed mass-loss rate of AGB stars. Within\nthe observed range of mass-loss rates of AGB stars, however,\nthe amount of MgS that can condense on seed particles in stellar\nwinds is much too low to explain the observed strong emission\nband from MgS in the infrared spectra of many carbon stars.\nA model of heterogeneous growth of MgS on SiC precursor grains is proposed here as the most promising mechanism\nof MgS formation. Analysis of the equilibrium chemistry of sulphur compounds in a carbon rich mixture shows that the formation of MgS is strongly coupled to the process of silicon carbide\ncondensation. If no SiC is formed in a stellar outflow, the sulphur\nis almost completely bound in SiS molecules. Only after significant consumption of the abundant gas phase SiS by SiC formation, H2 S is formed in abundance and reactions of this with Mg\nmakes possible MgS condensation.\nOur model calculations of MgS formation in stellar outflows\nshow that only MgS growth as mantle atop SiC cores, that condensed before the on-set of MgS formation, results in sufficiently\nhigh degrees of condensation of Mg into MgS of the order of\n\u223c 0.2 which are required that MgS may be clearly visible in the\ninfrared spectrum. Condensation of MgS on tiny seed particles\nwould result in a fraction of the Mg condensed in MgS dust of\nthe order of only 0.01. This is much too small to be detectable.\nAdditionally, we performed calculations of the extinction\nproperties of grains with SiC core and MgS coating of various\nthicknesses. The presence of a SiC core inside of MgS grains\nresults within some range of core/mantle volume ratios in a secondary peak near 33 . . . 35 \u03bcm in the broad emission band associated with MgS, that seems to be observed in some spectra\nof AGB stars. This feature is absent if MgS forms a mantle on\ncarbon grains. We propose this feature as an indicator for the\npresence of a silicon carbide core of MgS grains, if the presence\nof MgS is indicated by its absorption band around 26 \u03bcm.\nAcknowledgements.
