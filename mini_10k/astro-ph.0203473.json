The evolutionary sequence:\nFSRQ\u2192LBL\u2192HBL, has recently been suggested by D'Elia &\nCavaliere (2000) and Cavaliere & D'Elia (2001). In this evolutionary sequence, less gas is left to fuel the central engine for\nBL Lac objects, and the advection dominated accretion flows\n(ADAFs) may be in most BL Lac objects. The blazar spectral\ncalculations support this scenario (B\u00f6ttcher & Dermer 2002).\nThere are several tens of BL Lac objects in which one (or\nmore) broad emission line has been detected. It is therefore\npossible to infer the central ionizing luminosity through their\nbroad line emission for these BL Lac objects. The limits on the\ncentral black hole mass can be obtained, if the accretion type\nin the central engine is known. The cosmological parameters\nH0 = 75 kms\u22121 Mpc\u22121 and q0 =0.5 have been adopted in this\nwork.\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nThe masses of the central black holes in quasars are crucial\nin understanding the evolution of quasars. Some different approaches are proposed to estimate the masses of the black holes\nin active galactic nuclei (AGNs), such as the gas kinematics\nnear a hole (see Ho & Kormendy (2000) for a review and references therein). The black hole mass derived from the direct\nmeasurements on the gases moving near the hole is reliable,\nbut it is only available for very few AGNs. For most AGNs,\nthe central black hole masses can be inferred from the velocities of the clouds in broad line regions (BLRs) and the sizes of\nBLRs (Dibai 1981; Wandel, Peterson, & Malkan 1999; Kaspi\net al. 2000). Most BL Lac objects have featureless optical and\nultraviolet continuum spectra, and only a small fraction of BL\nLac objects show very weak broad emission lines (Veron-Cetty\n& Veron 2000). It is therefore difficult to estimate their central black hole mass from the kinematics of their BLRs. The\ndiscovery of a tight correlation between stellar velocity dispersion and black hole mass in nearby galaxy bulges offers a new\ntool for estimate of the black hole mass (Ferrarese & Merritt\n2000; Gebhardt et al. 2000). The black hole mass can be estimated from the measurement of bulge velocity dispersion using the M \u2212 \u03c3 relation. The masses of the black holes in some\nnearby BL Lac objects have been estimated from the measurement of their bulge velocity dispersion (Falomo, Kotilainen, &\nTreves 2001, 2002; Barth, Ho, & Sargent 2002). Wu, Liu, &\nZhang (2002) adopted the fundamental plane for ellipticals to\nestimate the velocity dispersion and then the hole masses for\nsome AGNs. Fan, Xie, & Bacon (1999) derived the masses of\nthe black holes in Mkn 501 and some other blazars from the\ngamma-ray variability time scale. They found that the masses\nare around 107 M\u2299 .\nGhisellini et al. (1998) used a large sample of blazar broadband spectra to study the blazar sequence. They suggested a sequence: HBL\u2192LBL\u2192FSRQ. This sequence represents an increasing energy density of the external radiation field that leads\nto an increasing amount of Compton cooling. The decrease\nof the maximum energy in the electron distribution causes\nthe synchrotron and Compton peaks to shift to lower frequen-\n\n2. ESTIMATE ON THE IONIZING LUMINOSITY\n\nIt is not possible to measure the ionizing luminosity directly\nfrom observations on BL Lac objects, since the observed continuum emission from the jets is strongly beamed to us. In this\ncase, the optical emission line luminosity can be used to estimate the central ionizing luminosity (Rawlings & Saunders\n1991; Celotti, Padovani, & Ghisellini 1997; Cao & Jiang 1999).\nWe can estimate the ionizing continuum luminosity L\u03bb,ion at\nthe given wavelength \u03bb0 as\nLline\n,\n(1)\nEWion\nwhere \u03bb0 is the wavelength of the line, EWion is the equivalent\nwidth of the broad emission line corresponding to the ionizing continuum emission (different from the observed continuum emission).\nThe uncertainty in Eq. (1) is the value of EWion , which may\nbe different for individual sources. We estimate the value of\nEWion from the Boroson & Green (1992) sample. This sample\nL\u03bb,ion (\u03bb0 ) =\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nCao X\n\ncontains all 87 PG quasars (z < 0.5) with high quality optical\nspectra. The average value of EWH\u03b2 is 100 \u00c5 for 70 radio-quiet\nquasars. Unlike blazars, the optical continuum of radio-quiet\nquasar has not been contaminated by the beamed synchrotron\nemission from the jet. We will take EWion = 100 \u00c5 and use the\nbroad emission line H\u03b2 to estimate the ionizing continuum luminosity of BL Lac objects. The BL Lac objects seem to follow\nthe statistical behavior of quasars in the correlations between\nradio and broad line emission (Celotti, Padovani, & Ghisellini\n1997; Cao & Jiang 1999). It may imply that the properties of\nBLRs in BL Lac objects are not significantly different from that\nin quasars. If the EWion of BL Lac objects deviates from that\nof quasars systematically, then the estimated black hole mass\ncould be modified with EWion (see further discussion in Sect.\n5).\n\nhole mass Mbh in Fig. 2. We can obtain a lower limit on the\nmass of the black hole from LH\u03b2 using the relation \u03bbLmax\n\u03bb \u2212 Mbh\nplotted in Fig. 2.\nFor BL Lac objects, most accretion power may be carried by\nstrong jets and the accretion flows may probably be described\nby the adiabatic inflow-outflow solutions (ADIOSs) (Blandford, & Begelman 1999). In this case, the flow is fainter than the\npure ADAF considered here. The maximal \u03bbLmax\n\u03bb (\u03bb0 ) is therefore still valid for an ADIOS. It will not affect our estimate of\nthe black hole mass limits.\n\n3. ESTIMATE OF THE BLACK HOLE MASS\n\nFor a standard thin disk, the ionizing continuum luminosity\nis mainly determined by the central black hole mass and accretion rate. For a low accretion rate, the accretion flow will transit\nfrom standard thin disk type to the ADAF type (Narayan & Yi\n1995; Yi 1996).\n3.1. Standard thin accretion disks\nThe standard thin accretion disks are thought to be in most\nquasars (Koratkar & Blaes 1999). In this case, the luminosity at\noptical wavelength can be related with the disk luminosity by\nLd \u2243 9\u03bbL\u03bb,ion (5100 \u00c5) (Kaspi et al. 2000). The central black\nhole mass Mbh is then estimated by Mbh \u2243 10\u221238 (Ld /\u1e41)M\u2299 ,\nwhere \u1e41 = \u1e40/\u1e40Edd . The ionizing luminosity L\u03bb,ion can be inferred from LH\u03b2 , and we can finally estimate the black hole\nmass from the broad line luminosity LH\u03b2 , if \u1e41 is known. For\n\u1e41 = 1, the lower limit of the black hole mass is available.\n3.2. ADAFs\nThe transition of the accretion flow from the thin disk type\nto the ADAF type occurs while \u1e41 decreases to a value below\n\u1e41crit (Narayan & Yi 1995; Yi 1996). One possible mechanism\nfor the transition might be the evaporation of the disk (Meyer\n& Meyer-Hofmeister 1994; Liu et al. 1999; R\u00f3za\u0144ska & Czerny 2000; Meyer-Hofmeister & Meyer 2001). Gu & Lu (2000)\nsuggested that the transition can be triggered by the thermal instability of a radiation pressure-dominated standard accretion\ndisk.\nThe spectrum of an ADAF: L\u03bb (Mbh , \u1e41, \u03b1, \u03b2) can be calculated if the parameters Mbh , \u1e41, \u03b1, and the fraction of the magnetic pressure \u03b2 are specified. The parameter \u03b2 is defined as\npm = (1 \u2212 \u03b2)ptot . We can calculate the spectra of ADAFs using the approach proposed by Mahadevan (1997). For the fixed\nblack hole mass Mbh , the optical luminosity L\u03bb increases with\n\u03b1. For AGNs, the viscosity \u03b1 could be as high as 1, as suggested by Narayan (1996). In this work, We set \u03b1 = 0.3 to\ncalculate optical luminosity L\u03bb (Yi 1996; Choi, Yang, & Yi\n2001). The fraction of magnetic pressure \u03b2 = 0.5 for equipartition cases. In fact, our numerical results show that the maximal optical luminosity Lmax\n\u03bb always requires \u03b2 = 0.5, if all other\nparameters are fixed. The accretion rate \u1e41 < \u1e41crit \u2243 0.28\u03b12\nshould be satisfied for an ADAF (Mahadevan 1997). So, varying the accretion rate \u1e41, we can find the maximal optical luminosity at \u03bb0 numerically for \u03b1 = 0.3 and \u03b2 = 0.5 (see Fig.\n1). We plot the maximal value of \u03bbLmax\n\u03bb (\u03bb0 ) varying with black\n\n4. MASSES OF BLACK HOLES IN BL LAC OBJECTS\n\nDonato et al. (2001) complied a sample of blazars observed\nin the X-ray band, which includes almost all HBLs, IBLs, and\nmany LBLs. We collect all BL Lac objects in their sample and\n1 Jy+S4+S5 catalogues (Stickel, Meisenheimer, & K\u00fchr 1994;\nStickel, & K\u00fchr 1994, 1996) as our start sample. This sample\nincludes most identified LBLs and HBLs. We search the literature for all sources with broad emission line fluxes, and this\nleads to a sample of 23 sources (listed in Table 1). Most of them\nare LBLs, except three HBLs: 0651+428, Mkn 421, and Mkn\n501. The sources with relatively strong broad emission lines\n(EW > 10 \u00c5) are considered as genuine HPQs by Veron-Cetty\n& Veron (2000) and are therefore not included in our sample.\nThe source 3C 279 (1253\u2212055) is classified as a BL Lac object in Veron-Cetty & Veron (2000) due to its small broad line\nequivalent width, though this source is usually regarded as a\nquasar in other literature.\nMany sources in this sample have detected Mg II or H\u03b1 line\nemission instead of H\u03b2. We use line ratios reported by Francis\net al. (1991) to estimate H\u03b2 line luminosity LH\u03b2 from the line\nluminosity of H\u03b1 or Mg II. The broad emission line luminosity\nLH\u03b2 are listed in Table 1. The distribution of the line luminosity\nLH\u03b2 is plotted in Fig. 3.\nWe use Eq. (1) and the line luminosity LH\u03b2 to estimate the\nionizing continuum luminosity at 4861 \u00c5. The central black\nhole masses Mbh,1 and Mbh,2 can be estimated in the cases of\na thin disk and an ADAF, respectively. The mass derived for\nthe standard thin disk case also depends on accretion rate \u1e41.\nThe lower limit of Mbh,1 can be available by setting \u1e41 = 1. If\nthe transition of the accretion flow from the thin disk type to the\nADAF type occurs at \u1e41 \u223c \u1e41crit , we can have an upper limit on\nMbh,1 setting \u1e41 = 0.025 for \u03b1 = 0.3. For ADAFs, Mbh,2 is the\nlower limit, since the maximal optical continuum luminosity is\ncalculated for the given black hole mass. We list the derived\nblack hole masses in Columns (6) and (7) of Table 1.\n\n\fEvidence for the evolutionary sequence of blazars\n\nF IG . 1.- The optical luminosity of ADAFs at 4861 \u00c5 varies with accretion\nrate \u1e41 for different black hole masses (\u03b1 = 0.3 and \u03b2 = 0.5 are adopted).\n\n3\n\nF IG . 3.- The distribution of the broad emission line luminosity LH\u03b2 .\n\n5. DISCUSSION\n\nF IG . 2.- The maximal optical luminosity of ADAFs at 4861 \u00c5 as functions\nof black hole mass for different values \u03b1: \u03b1 =0.1 (dashed line), 0.3 (solid), and\n1 (dotted).\n\nThe distribution of line luminosity LH\u03b2 of all these BL Lac\nobjects suggests a bimodal nature, although this cannot be statistically proven on the basis of the present, rather small sample\n(see Fig. 3). We define the sources with LH\u03b2 < 1041 ergs s\u22121 as\npopulation A, and all others are in population B. It is still not\nclear whether this bimodal nature of line luminosities would\nhold for a larger sample. It would be interesting to perform\nhigh-sensitivity optical observations on a large sample of BL\nLac objects.\nFor thin disk cases, the lower limits on the hole mass would\nbe in 104\u22128 M\u2299 , while the upper limits on the hole mass would\nbe in 106\u221210 M\u2299 if \u1e41 \u223c 0.025. For accretion rate \u1e41 < 0.025,\nthe accretion flow would be in ADAF state. In this case, the\nlower limits on the black hole mass are in: 108\u221212 M\u2299 , which\nis similar to the results of Wang, Xue, & Wang (2001). Noting\nthat this is the lower limit, the black hole mass could be much\nhigher if the accretion rate is low or/and the viscosity \u03b1 is small.\nThe masses of black holes in all sources of population B are\nin 106\u22128 M\u2299 if \u1e41 \u223c 1. It would be interesting to pay much attention on the seven sources in population A. If the accretion\nflows in these sources are in thin disk state, their central black\nholes would have masses 104\u22126 M\u2299 for any value of \u1e41. If the\naccretion rate \u1e41 is lower than the critical value \u1e41crit , the accretion flows in these sources are in the ADAF state. The lower\nlimits on the mass of the black hole in these sources are in the\nrange of 1.66 \u2212 24.5 \u00d7 108 M\u2299 . Falomo, Kotilainen, & Treves\n(2001) found that the mass of the black hole in Mkn 501 is\n3.2 \u00d7 108 M\u2299 from the measurement of bulge velocity dispersion, while Barth, Ho, & Sargent (2002) derived the mass of\n(0.9 \u2212 3.4) \u00d7 109 M\u2299 . Considering that our estimate (1.66 \u00d7 108\nM\u2299 ) is the lower limit, the central black hole mass can be higher\nthan the limit if the accretion rate is sufficiently low or/and the\nviscosity \u03b1 is small. Our result is consistent with their results of\nMkn 501 derived from bulge velocity dispersion. It may probably that the sources in population A have already been in ADAF\nstate.\n\n\f4\n\nCao X\n\nThe sources in population B may have standard thin accretion disks surrounding the black holes, otherwise some black\nholes should be at least as huge as 1012 M\u2299 . If the accretion\nrate \u1e41 of these sources is as small as \u223c 0.025, slightly higher\nthan the critical value below which the accretion flow would be\nin ADAF state, the black hole mass would be in 108\u221210 M\u2299 .\nAs the fact that most FSRQs have black hole mass higher than\n108 M\u2299 (Laor 2000; McLure & Dunlop 2001; Gu, Cao, & Jiang\n2001), this is compatible with the unified models of radio-loud\nquasars (Urry & Padovani 1995).\nThere are three HBLs in our sample in population A, and all\nsources in population B are LBLs. It may imply that the accretion flows in all HBLs are in ADAF state. The fact that no broad\nemission line has been detected for most BL Lac objects may\nimply that only a small fraction of LBLs have optically thick\nstandard thin accretion disks surrounding the black holes with\nvery low accretion rate close to \u1e41crit . We speculate that these\nLBLs will finally exhaust the gas near the hole and the disks\nwill transit to ADAFs. Most other LBLs and HBLs without any\nbroad emission line detected may be in population A, and the\naccretion flows have already been in ADAF state. Otherwise\nthe black holes in these sources should be very small, if the\naccretion flows are in standard thin disk state. It is most probably that the BL Lac objects studied here with one (or more)\nbroad emission line detected are in the intermediate state of the\nevolutionary sequence from FSRQ to BL Lac object. The fact\nthat no HBL is in population B may imply that the evolutionary sequence of BL Lac objects should be LBL\u2192HBL. The\n\nresults present in this Letter support the evolutionary sequence\nFSRQ\u2192LBL\u2192HBL suggested by D'Elia & Cavaliere (2000).\nIf this is the case, then the ratio of the BL Lac objects in population B to the remainder offers a clue to study the detailed\nevolutionary history of blazars, and it can also be a useful test\non ADAF models.\nIf the evolution of blazars is really regulated by the gas near\nthe black hole, the reprocessing optical depth of the BLR would\ndecrease with the depletion of the gas near the hole, and the line\nEWion of the blazar would also decrease along the evolutionary\nsequence. The lower limits on the mass of the hole in evolving\nblazars should be modified with varying EWion . In this work,\nwe used a single EWion to derive the masses of holes in blazars\nand found that the holes have similar masses for these two populations of BL Lac objects. In this case, the lower limits on the\nmass of the hole in the blazars evolving at a later stage would\nbecome systematically higher than that derived in this work.\nThe derived hole masses seem to be consistent with the evolutionary sequence FSRQ\u2192LBL\u2192HBL.\nI thank the anonymous referee's helpful comments.
