One of the most fascinating (but speculative)\npossibilities is that there is a significant abundance of mirror matter within our solar\nsystem. If the mirror matter condensed to form a large body of planatary or stellar mass\nthen there could be interesting observable effects. Indeed studies of long period comets\nsuggest the existence of a solar companion which has escaped direct detection and is\ntherefore a candidate for a mirror body. Nemesis, hypothetical \"death star\" companion\nof the Sun, proposed to explain biological mass extinctions, may potentially be a mirror\nstar. We examine the prospects for detecting these objects if they do indeed exist and\nare made of mirror matter.\nSubject headings: dark matter \u2013 stars: individual (Nemesis)\nOne of the most interesting candidates for dark matter coming from particle physics is \"mirror\nmatter\". Mirror matter is predicted to exist if parity is a symmetry of Nature (Lee and Yang 1956,\nKobzarev et al. 1966, Pav\u0161i\u010d 1974, Foot et al. 1991). The idea is that for each ordinary particle, such\nas the photon, electron, proton and neutron, there is a corresponding mirror particle, of exactly the\nsame mass as the ordinary particle. The fundamental interactions of the mirror particles precisely\nmirrors those of the ordinary particles. For example, the mirror proton interacts with the mirror\nphoton in precisely the same way in which an ordinary proton interacts with an ordinary photon.\nThe mirror particles are not produced in laboratory experiments just because they couple very\nweakly to the ordinary particles. In the modern language of gauge theories, the mirror particles\nare all singlets under the standard G \u2261 SU (3) \u2297 SU (2)L \u2297 U (1)Y gauge interactions. Instead the\nmirror particles interact with a set of mirror gauge particles, so that the gauge symmetry of the\ntheory is doubled, i.e. G \u2297 G (the ordinary particles are, of course, singlets under the mirror gauge\nsymmetry) (Foot et al. 1991). Parity is conserved because the mirror particles experience V + A\nmirror weak interactions and the ordinary particles experience the usual V \u2212 A weak interactions.\nOrdinary and mirror particles interact with each other predominately by gravity only.\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nWhile mirror matter has always been extremely well motivated theoretically, it is only in\nrelatively recent times that the experimental and observational evidence for it has accumulated\nto the point where an impressive case for its existence can be made (for a review of the current\nstatus of mirror matter, see Foot 2001b). First, it provides a natural candidate for dark matter.\nMirror matter is naturally dark and stable and appears to have the necessary properties to explain\nthe dark matter inferred to exist in the Universe (Blinnikov and Khlopov 1982, 1983, Kolb et al.\n1985, Khlopov et al. 1991, Hodges 1993, Matsas et al. 1998, Bell and Volkas 1999, Berezinsky and\nVilenkin 2000, Berezhiani et al. 2000). On galactic scales, there is evidence from a recent weak\nmicrolensing study (Erben et al. 2000, Gray et al. 2001) for large clumps of invisible matter which\nmight be a mirror galaxy (or galaxy cluster) (Foot 2001b). Within galaxies such as our own Milky\nway, mirror matter may be the dominant component of the halo, thereby explaining the MACHO\nobservations (Silagadze 1997, Blinnikov 1998, Foot 1999, Mohapatra and Teplitz 1999) 1 . On small\nscales (such as solar system scale) systems containing ordinary and mirror matter could exist but\nit is likely that they should be quite unequally mixed (e.g. 99% ordinary matter and 1% mirror\nmatter). This is because ordinary and mirror matter are naturally segregated on small scales as\nthey don't have common dissipative interactions (Blinnikov and Khlopov 1982, 1983, Kolb et al.\n1985, Khlopov et al. 1991). In fact, the strange properties of some of the extrasolar planets may\nbe explained more naturally if they are mirror planets (Foot 1999b, 2001a). Furthermore, recent\nHubble Space Telescope star count results show the deficit of local luminous matter (Blinnikov\n1999, 2000; However there is some controversy with Hipparcos satellite data, see Holmberg and\nFlynn 1998), expected if the population of the mirror stars in the galactic disk is numerous enough\n(Blinnikov and Khlopov 1982, 1983).\nOn quite a different tack, there is evidence for mirror matter coming from the solar and\natmospheric neutrino anomalies (Foot et al. 1992, Foot 1994, Foot and Volkas 1995. For a review\nof the neutrino physics anomalies, see e.g. Langacker 1999). Ordinary and mirror neutrinos are\nmaximally mixed with each other if neutrinos have mass (Foot et al. 1992, Foot 1994, Foot\nand Volkas 1995). The maximal \u03bde \u2192 \u03bde\u2032 (the \u2032 denote the mirror particle) oscillations predict\nan approximate 50% \u03bde flux reduction thereby explaining the solar neutrino experiments while\nthe maximal \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u03bc\u2032 oscillations predict the up-down neutrino asymmetry observed in SuperKamiokande (Fukuda et al. 1998a, 1998b) (see e.g. Foot et al. 1998, Foot 2000, Fornengo et al.\n2000 for a fit of maximal \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u03bc\u2032 oscillations to the data). The idea is also compatible with the\nLSND experiment (Foot et al. 1992, Foot 1994, Foot and Volkas 1995). Interestingly, maximal\nordinary - mirror neutrino oscillations do not pose any problems for big bang nucleosynthesis\n(BBN) and can even fit the inferred primordial abundances better than the standard model (Foot\nand Volkas 1997, 2000).\n1\n\nThe conventional red, brown or white dwarf interpretation of these MACHO events have real problems (see e.g.\nFreese et al. 1999). It is also possible that the MACHO events are due to lens in the LMC (and not actually in the\nhalo of our galaxy), however this interpretation also is problematic (see for example, Gyuk et al. 1999).\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nFinally there are several other interesting effects of mirror matter which have been discussed\nsuch as photon - mirror photon kinetic mixing (Holdom 1986, Glashow 1986, Carlson and Glashow\n1987, Collie and Foot 1998), Higgs - mirror Higgs mixing (Foot et al. 1991, H. Lew, unpublished)\nand possible ordinary - mirror particle interactions (Silagadze 1999) expected in currently popular\nmodels of large extra dimensions (Akama 1982, Rubakov and Shaposhnikov 1983, Arkani-Hamed\net al. 1998). It should also be noted that there are variants of the mirror matter idea where the\nmirror symmetry is assumed to be spontaneously broken (Barr et al. 1991, Akhmedov et al. 1992,\nFoot and Lew 1994, Berezhiani and Mohapatra 1995, Berezhiani et al. 1996, Berezhiani 1996,\nMohapatra and Sciama 1998, Lindebaum et al. 2000).\nGiven the possibility that many nearby stars have \"hot jupiters\", which may really be \"cool\nmirror planets\", it is possible that there are also mirror stars/planets/comets etc gravitationally\nbound to our sun. Of course, any very nearby large planet would have been detected via its\ngravitational influence. A more distant companion is a priori a fascinating possibility. In fact\nthere is some evidence for the existence of such objects from biological mass extinctions and recent\nstudies of long period comets as we now discuss.\nOver the past 15 years or so there has been speculation that there is a companion star to the sun,\ncalled \"Nemesis\" (Whitmire and Jackson 1984, Davis et al. 1984). The motivation for Nemesis was\nbased on studies suggesting that biological mass extinctions displayed some periodicity (on a time\nscale of about 26 million years) which required an extraterrestrial cause (Raup and Sepkoski 1984).\nIt was also argued that the ages of craters displayed a similar periodicity (Rampino and Stothers\n1984, Alvarez and Muller 1984). The idea is that Nemesis would have a moderately eccentric orbit\nwith an orbital period of 26 million years, which would periodically disturb the Oort cloud and\ncause comets to enter into the inner solar system and trigger the mass extinctions. Subsequent\nsearches for Nemesis failed to find it (Perlmutter 1986) and also some studies suggested that its\norbit was likely to be unstable (see e. g. Clube and Napier 1984). However if the orbit is near the\ngalactic plane, the current Nemesis's lifetime can be as big as 109 years (Hut 1984, Torbett and\nSmoluchowski 1984, Vandervoort and Sather 1993). This lifetime is not long enough for Nemesis\nto have been in such a large orbit at the formation of the solar system, about 5 \u00d7 109 years ago.\nHowever at the formation of the solar system, at which time Nemesis was also presumably formed,\nthe orbit may have been much tighter, expanding to the present orbit as a consequence of tidal\nperturbations from passing stars and molecular clouds (Hut 1984). It has been argued that the\nperturbations by gigantic molecular clouds may be the most serious threat for stability of Nemesis\n(Clube and Napier 1984), but it has also been argued that the very diffuse nature of these massive\nclouds greatly reduces the possible effect (Morris and Muller 1986).\nRecently, new much more direct evidence for planetary or stellar companions to the sun has\nalso emerged. Two groups (Murray 1999, Matese et al. 1999) have studied the orbits of long period\ncomets. They find that there is a statistically significant excess of aphelion distances of long-period\ncomets aligned on a great circle (for comets in the 30k-50k A.U. range). The approach of the\ntwo groups was quite different, with the Murray 1999 taking a subsample of the most accurately\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nobserved long period comets while Matese et al. 1999 used a larger sample, but included less well\nobserved comets. Apparently, the two groups find somewhat different great circles, which can mean\nseveral things. It might mean that there are two companions, or only one companion (if one of the\ngroups is mistaken) or no such companion (if they both screwed up). For example, the study of\nMurray 1999 finds that the data suggests the existence of a large planet or star with orbital period\nof around 6 million years (which implies a distance from the sun of about 32000 A.U. for a circular\norbit). The analysis suggests that the orbital plane of the companion planet/star was inclined at\nroughly 35o to the galactic plane with a retrograde orbit. Interestingly, both of these characteristics,\nthe relatively low inclination to the galactic plane and the retrograde orbit were already identified\nas necessary conditions for the stability of such orbit (Hut 1984, Torbett and Smoluchowski 1984,\nVandervoort and Sather 1993). Thus, it seems to be possible that the hypothetical planet/star\nidentified in Murray 1999 was an original member of the solar system. Clearly, further data should\nclarify whether such companions really exist.\nIf companion stars/planets do exist, then it is possible that they are light enough to be below\nthe hydrogen burning threshold and may have escaped detection. However, another possibility is\nthat the companion objects may be made of mirror matter (the possibility that Nemesis exists\nand is made of mirror matter was earlier discussed in Silagadze 2001 2 ). This will give a simple\nexplanation for why their orbital plane is inclined with respect to the ecliptic (naturally, tidal\nperturbations may have modified their orbits somewhat over time too). Indeed, because ordinary\nand mirror matter couple together mainly by gravity, it is natural for the ordinary and mirror parts\nof nebula (from which the solar system was made) to have different initial conditions, like angular\nmomentum. If the galaxy contains a significant amounts of mirror matter, such mixed protosolar\nnebula can be formed, for example, during inter-penetration of ordinary and mirror giant molecular\nclouds (Khlopov et al. 1991).\nOf course it is certainly true that if there is a mirror matter companion within our solar system\nthen its existence will be challenging to establish. Nevertheless it is important to keep in mind that\nthis possibility, which might be true, is in principle a testable hypothesis!\nFirst of all let us mention some indirect checks. If the Sun-Nemesis constitute a mixed binary\nsystem there will be other similar star systems around. We have already mentioned strange properties of some recently observed extrasolar planets and their interpretation as mirror planets orbiting\nordinary stars (Foot 1999, 2001a). One can imagine a reversed situation: an ordinary planet orbiting mirror star. Remarkably eighteen \"isolated planetary mass objects\" were actually discovered\n(Zapatero Osorio et al. 2000, Lucas and Roche 2000; See also Tamura et al. 1998) in \u03c3 Orionis\nstar cluster. Instead of being really isolated, which will challenge conventional theories of planet\n2\n\nThe possibility that the protosolar nebula could contain \"shadow\" matter and its evolution could lead to the\nformation of some mirror solar objects, like Nemesis, was also mentioned in Kolb et al. 1985. But this idea was not\nfurther developed in Kolb et al. 1985 and even taken seriously, because it was thought that big bang nucleosynthesis\ndata excludes the \"shadow world\" with completely symmetric microphysics.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nformation, these objects could be ordinary Jovian type planets orbiting invisible mirror stars (Foot\net al. 2000a). This idea can be tested by searching for a periodic Doppler shift of absorption lines\nin the planet emanation spectra (Foot et al. 2000a), or/and by Planetary Microlensing technique\n(Mao and Paczy\u0144ski 1991; For recent review see Sackett 1999).\nPhoton-mirror photon mixing can effect the orthopositronium lifetime (Glashow 1986) and\nlead to an interesting resolution of the orthopositronium lifetime puzzle (Foot and Gninenko 2000).\nIf the mixing parameter has indeed the magnitude required for the mirror world interpretation\nof the orthopositronium anomaly (and this will be experimentally tested in future vacuum cavity\nexperiments), a new window will be opened in mirror matter searches in the solar system. As\nmirror meteoroids would effectively interact with Earth's atmosphere in this case, releasing most of\ntheir kinetic energy in the atmosphere and possibly ending in atmospheric explosion (Foot 2001b,\nFoot and Gninenko 2000). In such \"Tunguska-like\" events neither meteoroid fragments nor any\nsignificant crater would be found. Also, any ordinary matter accreted onto the mirror companion\ncan potentially become hot due to the coupling of mirror matter to ordinary matter via the photon\n-mirror photon mixing. This may make the mirror companion potentially observable (and may be\nappear to have the characteristics of a strange type of white dwarf, especially if the companion\nobject is of stellar weight) (Foot et al. 2000b).\nAnother means of investigating the Nemesis hypothesis is provided by exploration of cratering\nrates of the nearby celestial bodies such as the Moon and the Mars. It was argued (Muller 1993)\nthat the age distribution of craters on the Moon can be studied by using lunar spherulus. A pilot\nstudy had been already performed (Culler et al. 2000) using 155 spherulus from the lunar soil\ndelivered by Appolo-14 mission. The results are promising. From 3 Gyr ago until about 0.4 Gyr\nago the inferred cratering rate gradually decreases. This is consistent with expectation that the\ndensity of potential impactors (asteroids and comets) should decrease as time goes by, because\nJupiter slowly eliminates them by deflecting them into the Sun or ejecting them out of the solar\nsystem. At 0.4 Gyr, however, the rate suddenly increases by a factor of 3.7 \u00b1 1.2 and returns to\nthe level it had 3 Gyr earlier. This fact has \"a ready explanation\" (Culler et al. 2000) in the\nframework of the Nemesis hypothesis. One can imagine that just about 0.4 Gyr ago the Nemesis\nwas perturbed into a more eccentric orbit by a passing star, thus becoming able to approach the\nOort cloud closely at every subsequent perihelions and trigger comet showers.\nThe median age uncertainty, achieved thus far in the lunar spherule project, is about 150 Myr\nnot sufficient to resolve a 26 Myr periodicity \u2013 the main prediction of the Nemesis hypothesis. But\nfuture similar studies will hopefully reach the necessary precision. If the 26 Myr periodicity in\ncratering rates is unambiguously established but the Nemesis nevertheless is not found in future\nparallax surveys of the stars as dim as 10th magnitude (the Hipparcos satellite surveyed only about\n1/4 of the known candidates (Culler et al. 2000)), the mirror option will get strong support.\nEven if mirror solar companions exist and are invisible, then their existence could still be\nconfirmed! Even completely dark compact gravitating objects reveal themselves through the grav-\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nitational lensing effect they produce on background stars (Paczy\u0144ski 1997, Roulet and Mollerach\n1997). It is expected that Space Interferometry Mission (SIM), planned to be launched in 2005, will\nallow a determination of the mass, the distance, and the proper motion of virtually any MACHO\ncapable of inducing a microlensing event (Miralda-Escud\u00e9 1996, Paczy\u0144ski 1998). For putative\nmicrolensing event due to Nemesis the angular Einstein ring radius would be (Paczy\u0144ski 1998)\ns\nr\nMN\n1 pc\n\u03c6E \u2248 90 mas\n,\nM\u2299\nDN\nwhere MN is the Nemesis mass and DN the distance to it. Thus it will be resolved by SIM which\nis expected to have angular resolution of about 10 mas. Therefore if such a microlensing event is\nreally detected, it will give a very detailed information about Nemesis. The only problem is that\nbecause the present position of the Nemesis is unknown we are forced to relay merely on a chance\nto discover the event or perform a full sky dedicated search for it.\nWhether or not mirror matter exists will become clearer as time goes by. In the mean time,\nit is fun to think about the implications of fascinating possibilities such as mirror planets in our\nsolar system. In addition to the (admittedly very speculative) evidence for faint solar companions\nprovided by observations discussed above, it is also possible that some other much closer and smaller\nmirror planet can also exist. Over time, if its orbit is eccentric enough, such planet can approach to\nvarious \"normal\" solar planets and cause observed oddities in the solar system, like Pluto's orbit.\nWe can also speculate that the formation of the Moon was a result of tidal fission of the Earth\ncaused by a close encounter with a mirror planet.\nBut speculations apart, the hypothesis that there are some mirror objects in the solar system\nis in principle testable hypothesis, because these mirror objects can lead to observable effects due\nto their gravitational interactions and they may also observably radiate if they contain enough\nordinary matter.\nAcknowledgement\nR.F. is an Australian Research Fellow.
