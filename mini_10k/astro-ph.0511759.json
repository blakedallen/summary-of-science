Using N-body simulations, we show that\ntidal stripping always leads to flat or rising projected velocity dispersions beyond a\ncritical radius; it is \u223c 5 times more likely, when averaging over all possible projection\nangles, that the cylindrically averaged projected dispersion will rise, rather than be\nflat. In contrast, the Local Group dSphs, as a class, show flat or falling projected\nvelocity dispersions interior to \u223c 1 kpc. This argues for tidal stripping being unimportant interior to \u223c 1 kpc for most of the Local Group dSphs observed so far. We\nshow that tidal shocking may still be important, however, even when tidal stripping is\nnot. This could explain the observed correlation for the Local Group dSphs between\ncentral surface brightness and distance from the nearest large galaxy.\nThese results have important implications for the formation of the dSphs and for\ncosmology. As a result of the existence of cold stars at large radii in several dSphs,\na tidal origin for the formation of these Local Group dSphs (in which they contain\nno dark matter) is strongly disfavoured. In the cosmological context, a naive solution\nto the missing satellites problem is to allow only the most massive substructure dark\nmatter halos around the Milky Way to form stars. It is possible for dSphs to reside\nwithin these halos (\u223c 1010 M\u2299 ) and have their velocity dispersions lowered through\nthe action of tidal shocks, but only if they have a central density core in their dark\nmatter, rather than a cusp. A central density cusp persists even after unrealistically\nextreme tidal shocking and leads to central velocity dispersions which are too high to\nbe consistent with data from the Local Group dSphs. dSphs can reside within cuspy\ndark matter halos if their halos are less massive (\u223c 109 M\u2299 ) and therefore have smaller\ncentral velocity dispersions initially.\nKey words: galaxies: dwarf, galaxies: kinematics and dynamics, Local Group\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe Local Group of galaxies provides a unique test-bed\nfor galaxy formation models and cosmology. The abundance, spatial distribution and internal mass distribution,\nof satellites within the Local Group can provide sensitive\ntests of cosmological predictions (see e.g. Moore et al. 1999,\nKlypin et al. 1999, Kravtsov et al. 2004, Mayer et al. 2001a\nand Mayer et al. 2001b). However, central to such studies is\nan understanding of what the Local Group satellite galaxies are. Observationally, they are usually split into three\ntypes: dSph galaxies, which typically have old stellar populations, are spheroidal in morphology, lie close to their host\ngalaxy1 and are devoid of HI gas; dIrr galaxies, which have\n\u22c6\n\nEmail: jir22@ast.cam.ac.uk\n\nyounger stellar populations, irregular morphology, lie further away from their host galaxy and contain significant HI\ngas; and the transition galaxies, which are in between the\ndSph and dIrr types (Mateo 1998).\nSince the dSph galaxies lie, in general, closer to\ntheir host galaxy (there are notable exceptions - see e.g.\nGrebel et al. 2003) it has often been argued that the tidal\nfield of the host galaxy has an important role to play in\nthe formation and evolution of these galaxies. Mayer et al.\n(2001a) and Mayer et al. (2001b) have suggested that all of\nthe Local Group satellite galaxies started out looking more\n\n1 We use the terminology 'host galaxy' throughout this paper to\nrefer to either the Milky Way or M31 depending on which of these\nis closer to the satellite being discussed.\n\n\f2\n\nRead et. al.\n\nlike the dIrrs, the dSphs then forming through tidal transformations. Kuhn & Miller (1989) and Kroupa (1997) have\nargued that the dSphs might have formed in the tidal tail of\na previous major merger; in their model, dSphs contain no\ndark matter and are nearly unbound. Stoehr et al. (2002)\nhave argued that the dSphs inhabit the most massive substructure dark matter halos, of mass \u223c 1010 M\u2299 , predicted\nby cosmological N-body simulations (see e.g. Klypin et al.\n1999 and Moore et al. 1999); in such a scenario, tides are\nunlikely to have significantly altered the visible distribution\nof stars in these galaxies.\nIn this paper we compare a suite of N-body simulations\nof dSph galaxies orbiting in a tidal field, with the latest\ndata from the Local Group dSphs (see Figure 1). In this\nway, we can constrain the importance of tidal effects for\nthese galaxies and break the degeneracies between the above\nformation scenarios.\nThe effects of tides on the Local Group dSphs has been\ninvestigated extensively in the literature, both dynamically\n(Aguilar & White 1986, Oh et al. 1995, Piatek & Pryor\n1995, Hayashi et al. 2003, Kazantzidis et al. 2004 and\nMashchenko et al. 2005), and within a cosmological framework (Kravtsov et al. 2004). This present work complements\nthat of previous authors. Like Hayashi et al. (2003) and\nKazantzidis et al. (2004), we perform simulations which are\nnot fully cosmologically consistent, but which have the advantage that the simulated satellites have very high resolution. Unlike these previous authors, however, our dSph\ngalaxies contain both stars and dark matter. This allows us\nto compare our results more easily with the observational\ndata from the Local Group dSphs.\nWe consider three possible scenarios for the tidal evolution of the Local Group dSphs. In the first (model A),\nwe revisit the hypothesis that the Local Group dSphs contain no dark matter and that their high velocity dispersions\narise instead from the action of tides2 . In the second scenario (models B and C), we investigate the hypothesis that\nthe dSphs are dark matter dominated, but that their outer\nregions have been shaped by tidal effects. In this case we ask\nwhether tides could directly cause the drop in projected velocity dispersion in the outer regions of the dSphs, recently\nobserved by Wilkinson et al. (2004); and see also Figure 1.\nIn the third scenario (model D), we investigate a scenario\nwhere dSphs were much more massive in the past. In this\ncase, tidal shocks cause their central density and velocity\ndispersions to fall significantly over a Hubble time, becoming consistent with current data at the present epoch. It\nis important to state explicitly here that we do not wish\nto model any one specific Local Group dSph, which would\n\n2\n\nA dark-matter free model for the formation of the Local Group\ndSphs is often referred to in the literature as the 'tidal model'.\nPrevious tidal models, such as Kroupa (1997), tried to use tides\nto explain even the central velocity dispersion of the Local Group\ndSphs. As a result, in their models, after a Hubble time, the\ndSphs became fully unbound. In the models we present here, we\nuse unrealistically large central mass to light ratios in order to fit\nthe high central velocity dispersions of the Local Group dSphs.\nThis means that tides need not work quite so hard to reproduce\nthe large outer velocity dispersions. If our tidal model is ruled out,\nmore extreme tidal models such as that investigated by Kroupa\n(1997) are also ruled out.\n\nrequire an extensive search through parameter space and\nprobably not be relevant when taken out of a cosmological\ncontext. Rather, we wish to investigate the generic effects of\ntides and how they reshape a dSph.\nThis paper is organised as follows: in section 2, we\nbriefly outline some key analytic results for tidal stripping\nand tidal shocking - the two dominant tidal effects which\nact on a satellite orbiting in a host galaxy potential. The\nanalytic results and definitions therein will be referred to\nthroughout this paper and are useful in both understanding\nand testing the simulation results. In section 3, we describe\nour numerical method for setting up the initial conditions\nand integrating the orbit of the satellite in the fixed potential\nof the Milky Way. In section 4, we present the results from\na set of representative N-body simulations simulations. We\ndemonstrate that tidal stripping will always lead to a flat or\nrising projected velocity dispersion. In section 5 we discuss\nour results in the context of cosmology; we place mass limits\non the Local Group dSphs. Finally, in section 6 we present\nour conclusions.\n\n2\n\nTHEORETICAL BACKGROUND\n\nA satellite in orbit around a host galaxy will experience\ntwo main tidal effects which will reshape the stellar and\ndark matter distributions: tidal stripping and tidal shocking. Since both of the mechanisms will be referred to many\ntimes throughout this paper, it is instructive to briefly outline the salient properties of each in this section.\n\n2.1\n\nTidal stripping\n\nWe discuss the theory of tidal stripping in much more detail\nin a companion paper, Read et al. (2005). Here we briefly\nsummarise the main results of that work. Tidal stripping\nrefers to the capture of stars by a host galaxy from a satellite galaxy beyond a critical radius: the tidal radius, rt . In\ngeneral, the tidal radius depends upon four factors: the potential of the host galaxy, the potential of the satellite, the\norbit of the satellite and, which is new to the calculation presented in Read et al. (2005), the orbit of the star within the\nsatellite. In Read et al. (2005), we demonstrate that this last\npoint is critical and suggest using three tidal radii to cover\nthe range of orbits of stars within the satellite. In this way\nwe show explicitly that prograde star orbits will be more easily stripped than radial orbits; while radial orbits are more\neasily stripped than retrograde ones.\nIn general, these three tidal radii must be calculated numerically as outlined in Read et al. (2005). We will use these\nmore accurate numerical calculations in the presentation of\ntidal radii later on in this paper. However, for the special\ncase of point mass potentials, rt reduces to the following\nsimple form:\n\nrt \u2243 xp\n\n\u0012\n\nMs\nMg\n\n\u00131/3 \u0010\n\n\uf8ebq\n\uf8f62/3\n2\n\u0011\n\u03b12 + 1 + 1+e\n\u2212\u03b1\n1/3\n1\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8 (1)\n2\n\n1+e\n\n1+\n\n1+e\n\nwhere xp and e are the pericentre and eccentricity of the\nsatellite's orbit, Ms is the total mass of the satellite, Mg is\nthe mass of the host galaxy and \u03b1 = \u22121, 0, 1 parameterises\n\n\fThe importance of tides for dSphs\n\n3\n\nFigure 1. Surface brightness profiles (left) and projected velocity dispersions (right) for three Local Group dSphs observed with good\nstellar kinematics. Data taken from Wilkinson et al. (2004), Kleyna et al. (2004), Irwin & Hatzidimitriou (1995) and Palma et al. (2003);\nbut see also Mart\u0131\u0301nez-Delgado et al. (2001) for deeper surface brightness data for UMi. Notice the similarities between each of the dSphs:\nthe surface brightness profiles are roughly exponential, while the projected velocity dispersions are approximately flat with a sharp fall-off\nat large radii (\u223c 1 kpc).\n\nthe orbit of the star within the satellite. From equation 1,\nwe can see that stars on prograde orbits (\u03b1 = 1) are more\neasily stripped than those on radial orbits (\u03b1 = 0), which are\nmore easily stripped than those on retrograde orbits (\u03b1 =\n\u22121). Notice that \u03b1 = 0 recovers the standard King (1962)\ntidal radius. Other analytic solutions also exist for powerlaw and a restricted class of split power-law density profiles\n(Read et al. 2005).\n\nstandard intuition that the tidal radius depends only (within\na factor) on the densities of the host galaxy and satellite\ngalaxy is only valid for stars within the satellite which are on\nradial orbits. For general star orbits, their stripping radius\nwill depend upon the mass distribution within the satellite\nand not just the enclosed mass.\n\nOver long times, orbital transformations cause a convergence of these three tidal radii on the prograde stripping\nradius and leads to the onset of tangential anisotropy beyond this point.\n\n2.2\n\nA final key result from Read et al. (2005) is that the\n\nTidal shocking\n\nA second important effect of tides is tidal shocking. Tidal\nshocks can be caused either as a satellite plunges through\nthe disc of the host galaxy (see e.g. Ostriker et al. 1972)\nor moves on a highly eccentric orbit through the galactic\n\n\f4\n\nRead et. al.\nModel\nA\nB\nC\nD\n\n\u03c1\u2217\nP: 5, 0.23\nP: 0.072, 0.23\nSP: 0.072, 0.1, 0\nSP: 0.072, 0.1, 0\n\n\u03c1DM\n\nN\u2217\n\nNone\nP: 14, 0.5\nSP: 90, 1.956, 1\nSP: 103 , 1.956, 1\n\n105\n105\n105\n105\n\n\u03be\u2217 (kpc)\n0.01\n0.01\n0.01\n0.01\n\nNDM\n106\n106\n106\n\n\u03beDM (kpc)\n\nOrbit\n\nTime(Gyrs)\n\n\u03b3\n\n0.01\n0.01\n0.01\n\n9 kpc,84 kpc,-34.7o\n\n10.43\n4.5\n4.5\n8.85\n\n0.0011\n0.00014\n0.15\n0.83\n\n23 kpc,85 kpc,-34.7o\n23 kpc,85 kpc,-34.7o\n6.5 kpc,80 kpc,7.25o\n\nTable 1.

Both scenarios are discussed\nin detail by Gnedin & Ostriker (1997), Gnedin et al. (1999)\nand Gnedin et al. (1999).\nIn the impulsive limit, the mean energy injected into\nthe satellite at the r.m.s. radius, r, for disc shocks is given\nby (Gnedin et al. 1999):\n\u2206Edisc =\n\n2 2\n2gm\nr\n(1 + x2 )\u2212\u03b1\n3Vz2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere: gm is the maximal disc force along the z direction (in\nall of the calculations presented in this paper it is a assumed\nthat the plane of the Milky Way disc lies perpendicular to\nthe z-axis); Vz is the z component of the satellite velocity at\nthe point it passes through the disc; x = \u03c9\u03c4 (\u03c9 is the angular\nvelocity of a star within the satellite at r; \u03c4 \u223c 2H/Vz is the\ntypical shock time for a disc of scale height, H); and \u03b1 is the\n\n\fThe importance of tides for dSphs\nadiabatic correction exponent which is \u223c 5/2 for fast shocks\n(Gnedin et al. 1999).\nSimilarly, the mean energy injected for an eccentric orbit in a spherical system (here an isothermal potential for\nthe host galaxy is assumed) is given by (Gnedin et al. 1999):\n\u2206Esph =\n\n1\n6\n\n\u0012\n\nv02 \u03c0r\nRp Vp\n\n\u00132\n\n(1 + x2 )\u2212\u03b1\n\n(3)\n\nwhere v0 is the asymptotic circular speed of test particles at\nlarge radii in the host galaxy potential, Rp is the pericentric\nradius, Vp is the satellite velocity at Rp and x is as above,\nbut the shock time is now given by, \u03c4 \u223c \u03c0Rp /Vp .\nWe make the somewhat crude assumption that the total\nenergy injected into the satellite due to a single shock at r\nis then given by the sum of the above two terms.\nAssuming that the satellite is in virial equilibrium before the tidal shock and that it has an isotropic velocity\ndistribution, the total specific energy of the satellite, E, is\ngiven by:\nE = \u2212T \u223c\n\n1 2\n1\nv (r) =\n2\n2\u03c1s (r)\n\nZ\n\nr\n\n\u221e\n\n\u03c1s (r)\n\nGMs (r)\ndr\nr2\n\n(4)\n\nwhere T is the satellite's total specific kinetic energy,\n1/2\nv 2 (r)\nis the velocity dispersion, \u03c1s (r) and Ms (r) are the\nmass and density profile of the satellite and the right hand\nside follows from the Jeans equations (Binney & Tremaine\n1987).\nWe assume that tidal shocks are important for the satellite if the energy injected is comparable to the total energy\nof the satellite initially. This gives:\n\u03b3=2\n\n\u0014\n\n\u2206Esph + \u2206Edisc\nv 2 (r)\n\n\u0015\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03b3 parameterises the importance of tidal shocks: tidal\nshocks are important for \u03b3 \u223c 1 and unimportant for \u03b3 \u226a 1.\nNotice from equations 2, 3 and 5 that the effectiveness of\ntidal shocks depends on the mass density of the satellite, the\npotential of the host galaxy and on the orbit of the satellite.\nThe strength of such shocks is very sensitive to the value\nof Rp . For the Milky Way potential employed in this paper,\nboth disc shocks and spherical tidal shocks are negligible for\norbits which never come closer than \u223c 20 kpc.\nThe value of \u03b3 for each of the four models presented in\nthis paper (labelled A-D) are given in Table 1. Model D is a\ncase of particular interest. For this model, \u03b3 \u223c 1 and so tidal\nshocks are very important. Yet the tidal radius (as obtained\nusing equation 1) lies at the edge of the light distribution.\nThus it is possible that some of the Local Group dSphs could\nbe in a regime where their visible light is strongly affected\nby tidal shocks but only very weakly perturbed by tidal\nstripping.\n\n3\n\nTHE NUMERICAL TECHNIQUE\n\n3.1\n3.1.1\n\nSetting up the initial conditions\nThe dSph galaxy\n\nThe initial conditions for the dSph galaxy were set up\nin a similar fashion to Kazantzidis et al. (2004), but for\ntwo-component spherical galaxies comprising a dark matter\n\n5\n\nhalo and some stars. Since this procedure is non-trivial we\nbriefly outline the major steps involved here:\n(i) The particle positions for each component are realised using standard accept/reject techniques with\nnumerically calculated comparison functions and analytic\ndensity profiles (Press et al. 1992).\n(ii) We use isotropic, spherically symmetric, distribution\nfunctions (Binney & Tremaine 1987). For each separate\ncomponent, i, with density, \u03c1i , in the total relative3 gravitational potential of all components, \u03c8, the distribution\nfunction is given by the Eddington formula:\n1\nf (\u01eb) = \u221a\n8\u03c0 2\n\n\"Z\n\n\u01eb\n\n0\n\n1\nd2 \u03c1i d\u03c8\n\u221a\n+\u221a\nd\u03c8 2 \u01eb \u2212 \u03c8\n\u01eb\n\n\u0012\n\nd\u03c1i\nd\u03c8\n\n\u0013\n\n\u03c8=0\n\n#\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u01eb is the specific energy. Note that, for any choice of \u03c1i\nand \u03c8 which are well behaved as r \u2192 \u221e, the second term\nin the brackets in equation 6 vanishes (Binney & Tremaine\n1987).\nFor a general two component system f (\u01eb) must be calculated numerically. In Kazantzidis et al. (2004), where only\nsingle component systems (dark matter only) were consid2\nered, the term dd\u03c8\u03c12i could be calculated analytically4 . Here,\nwhere in general \u03c8 = \u03c81 + \u03c82 + ... + \u03c8n for an n component\nsystem, this must be calculated numerically. We consider\nthe special case where \u03c8i and \u03c1i are known analytically for\neach component. In this case we can write:\nd2 \u03c1 i\n=\nd\u03c8 2\n\n\u0012\n\ndr\nd\u03c8\n\n\u00132\n\nd2 \u03c1 i\ndr d\u03c1i d\n+\ndr 2\nd\u03c8 dr dr\n\n\u0012\n\ndr\nd\u03c8\n\n\u0013\n\n(7)\n2\n\nThis means that we can calculate dd\u03c8\u03c12i in general\nanalytically for a given value of r. This avoids the need\nfor a noisy double numerical differential. However, we do\nstill need to generate a look-up table to solve the inversion\nfor r(\u03c8). Once this is done, however, we may perform\nthe integral in equation 6 and create a log look-up table\nfor f (\u01eb) over a wide range of \u01eb as in Kazantzidis et al. (2004).\n(iii) Once the distribution function, f (\u01eb), is known for\neach component, we can set up particle velocities using\nstandard accept/reject techniques (Press et al. 1992). We\ntake advantage of the fact that the maximum value of the\ndistribution function at a given point will be given by the\nmaximum value of \u01eb; that is for v = 0 (Kuijken & Dubinski\n1995).\nThis may seem like an unnecessarily large amount of\neffort to go to, when simple numerical techniques already\nexist for setting up multi-component galaxies (Hernquist\n1993). However, as pointed out by Kazantzidis et al.\n(2004), using approximate methods such as the Maxwellian\napproximation will lead to a small evolution away from\nthe initial conditions. This can lead to significant radial\nvelocity anisotropies being introduced at large radii. In a\n3\n\nThe relative gravitation potential, \u03c8 = \u2212\u03a6 + \u03a60 , used here is\nas defined in Binney & Tremaine (1987).\n4\n\nIn fact, even for single component models,\nfor a few special cases.\n\nd2 \u03c1 i\nd\u03c8 2\n\nis only analytic\n\n\f6\n\nRead et. al.\n\nFigure 3. Initial conditions for models A-D. The blue data points are for the Draco dSph galaxy taken from Wilkinson et al. (2004).\nThe black,red,green,purple lines are for models A,B,C,D respectively. Recall that in model A we have no dark matter, hence there is no\nblack line in the right panel plot of the dark matter distribution.\n\ncompanion paper (Read et al. 2005) we show that such\nanisotropies lead to significantly increased tidal stripping.\nThis is undesirable when we wish to perform controlled\nnumerical simulations of tidal stripping.\nIn Figure 2 we show an equilibrium test for our twocomponent model B (the other models showed similar results). The upper panels are for the stars, while the lower\npanels are for the dark matter. The left panels show the cumulative mass profile, the middle panels show the velocity\nanisotropy and the right panels show the fractional change\nin energy as a function of time. We use a modified anisotropy\nparameter, \u03b2\u2217 , given by:\n\u03b2\u2217 =\n\nvr2 \u2212 vt2\nvr2 + vt2\n\n(8)\n\nwhere vr2 and vt2 are the radial and tangential velocity dispersions respectively. This definition gives \u03b2\u2217 = \u22121 for pure\ncircular orbits, \u03b2\u2217 = 0 for isotropic orbits, and \u03b2\u2217 = 1 for\npure radial orbits5 .\nThe blue lines in Figure 2 are for the analytic initial\nconditions, the black lines are for the simulated initial conditions with 106 dark matter and 105 star particles, the red\nlines are for the simulated initial conditions evolved in isolation (i.e. with no external tidal field) for 5 Gyrs, while the\ngreen lines are for a simulation set up using the Maxwellian\napproximation (Hernquist 1993) and evolved for 5 Gyrs.\nThe most important point to take away from Figure 2 is\nthat we can confirm the findings of Kazantzidis et al. (2004)\nfor our two-component model. In the Maxwellian approximation the dark matter evolves away rapidly and significantly from the initial conditions. In particular, significant\nradial anisotropy is introduced to the dark matter at large\n5\n\nThe standard anisotropy parameter, \u03b2, is usually defined as\n\u03b2 = 1\u2212v\u03b82 /vr2 (Binney & Tremaine 1987). This definition is useful\nfor obtaining analytic solutions to the Jeans equations. However,\nit can be readily seen that for circular orbits \u03b2 \u2192 \u2212\u221e. In this\npaper it is useful to have a definition of anisotropy which is wellbehaved for all orbits and which is symmetrical around isotropic\norbits.\n\nradii (see green line, bottom right panel). In contrast, the\ndistribution function generated initial conditions are very\nstable over the whole simulation time.\nNotice that the energy both in the stars and dark matter\nis conserved to better than 2% over the whole simulation\ntime.\n3.1.2\n\nThe host galaxy potential\n\nWe used a host galaxy potential chosen to provide a\ngood fit to the Milky Way (Law et al. 2005), with a\nMiyamoto-Nagai potential for the Milky Way disc and bulge\n(Nagai & Miyamoto 1976), and a logarithmic potential for\nthe Milky Way dark matter halo. These are given by respectively (Binney & Tremaine 1987):\n\u2212GMd\n\u03a6mn (R, z) = p\n\u221a\n2\nR + (a + z 2 + b2 )2\n\n(9)\n\nwhere M = 5 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 is the disc mass, a = 4 kpc is the\ndisc scale length and b = 0.5 kpc is the disc scale height,\nand:\n\u0001\n1\n\u03a6log (r) = v02 ln Rc2 + r 2 + constant\n(10)\n2\n\nwhere Rc = 4.1 kpc is the halo scale length and v0 =\n220km/s is the asymptotic value of the circular speed of\ntest particles at large radii in the halo.\nNote that with the choice b = 0.5 kpc, we do not consider the case of maximal disk shocking which would occur\nfor b \u2192 0 (see equation 2). However, given that the amount\nof disc shocking is also degenerate with the orbit of the dSph\nwhich is poorly constrained, our simulations span a range\nfrom typical to extreme levels of shocking. In addition, none\nof our conclusions would be altered by stronger disk shocks.\n\n3.2\n\nForce integration and analysis\n\nThe initial conditions were evolved using a version of the\nGADGET N-body code (Springel et al. 2001) modified to\ninclude a fixed potential to model the host galaxy.\n\n\fThe importance of tides for dSphs\nA wide range of code tests were performed using different softening criteria, force resolution and timestep criteria and the results were found to be in excellent agreement with each other. We also explicitly checked the code\nagainst output from two other N-body codes: Dehnen (2000)\nand NBODY6 (Aarseth 1999), and found excellent agreement. Our force softening was chosen using the criteria of\nPower et al. (2003) and is shown in Table 1. For the equilibrium tests, our simulations were found to conserve total\nenergy to better than one part in 103 over the whole simulation time of 5 Gyrs.\nFinally, it is not trivial to mass and momentum centre\nthe satellite when performing analysis of the numerical data.\nAn incorrect mass centre can lead to spurious density and\nvelocity features (Pontzen et al. 2005). We use the method\nof shrinking spheres to find the mass and momentum centre\nof the satellite (Power et al. 2003).\n\npanel), projected velocity (middle panel) and projected velocity dispersion6 (right panel) for the stars. For the projected velocity dispersion, the errors are determined from\nPoisson statistics. Models A-D are presented down the page.\nIn Figure 5 we show the projected surface brightness profile\nfor the stars (left panel), the true velocity dispersion of the\nstars (middle panel) and the density profile of the dark matter (right panel). For clarity on the plots, we compare the\nresults of our simulations to data from the Draco dSph only,\non the assumption that Draco is representative of the most\ndark matter dominated Local Group dSphs (see section 1\nand Figure 1). In Figure 6 we show the effect of different\nviewing angles in projection on the sky, using model A as\nan example. In Figure 8 we show the mass loss, due to tides,\nas a function of time for all four models A-D.\n\n4.1\n3.3\n\nThe choice of initial conditions: models A-D\n\nWe chose four models for our initial conditions labelled A-D\nas shown in Table 1 and Figure 3. In all models the density\ndistribution for the stars and dark matter were given either\nby Plummer spheres (Binney & Tremaine 1987) or by Split\nPower law profiles (SP) (Hernquist 1990, Saha 1992, Dehnen\n1993 and Zhao 1996). The density-potential pairs for these\ndistributions are given by respectively:\n\u03c1plum =\n\n3M\n1\n4\u03c0a3 (1 + r22 )5/2\na\n\n\u2212GM\n\u03a6plum = \u221a\nr 2 + a2\n\u03c1SP =\n\u03a6SP =\n\nM (3 \u2212 \u03b1)\n1\n4\u03c0a3 (r/a)\u03b1 (1 + r/a)4\u2212\u03b1\n\n\u0003\nGM \u0002\n(1 + a/r)\u03b1\u22122 \u2212 1\na(2 \u2212 \u03b1)\n\n(11)\n\n(12)\n(13)\n(14)\n\nwhere M and a are the mass and scale length in both cases,\nand \u03b1 is the central log-slope for the SP profile (note that\nthe SP profile always goes as \u03c1SP \u221d r \u22124 for r \u226b a).\nAs detailed in section 1, each of these models was chosen\nto test a different scenario for the evolution of dSphs in the\npresence of tides. In all of the models, the dSph was placed\non a plunging orbit which took it through the Milky Way\ndisc. This ensured that both tidal stripping and shocking\nwere important (see section 2). The initial conditions, orbit\nand output time for each of the models are given in Table\n1. Models B and C placed the dSph on an orbit which is\nconsistent with current constraints from the proper motion\nof Draco (Kleyna et al. 2001). However, these proper motion\nmeasurements are notoriously difficult and the errors large\n(see e.g. Piatek et al. 2002). Thus in models A and D, we\nalso consider more extreme (i.e. more radial) orbits.\n\n4\n\nRESULTS\n\nThe results for models A-D are presented in Figures 4 and\n5. In Figure 4, we show the projected surface brightness (left\n\n7\n\nThe no-dark matter hypothesis: model A\n\nIn model A, we test the hypothesis that we can eliminate the\nneed for dark matter in dSph galaxies by instead employing\ntidal heating to raise the velocity dispersions. One of the\nappealing aspects of such a model is that it produces tidally\ndistorted isophotes, such as those which may have been seen\nin some dSphs (see e.g. Mart\u0131\u0301nez-Delgado et al. 2001 and\nPalma et al. 2003).\nIn Figure 4, top left panel, we can see that distortions\noccur naturally in such a tidal model and the S-shaped\nisophotes caused by tides can be clearly seen in this projection. However, once the kinematic data are taken into\naccount, it is clear that such a model runs into serious\ndifficulties. The projected velocity shows a strong gradient\n(10 km/s/kpc) due to the near-dominant tidal arms, whereas\nno such velocity gradients have been observed in the Local\nGroup dSphs so far (Wilkinson et al. 2004). Furthermore,\nthe projected velocity dispersion rises out towards the edge\nof the light, whereas the Local Group dSphs like Draco\nhave flat or falling projected velocity dispersions (see e.g.\nWilkinson et al. 2004, Mu\u00f1oz et al. 2005, Kleyna et al. 2004\nand Figure 1). It is possible, however, that such tidal features could be hidden in projection. Figure 6 shows the effect\nof different viewing projections on the sky for model A. The\ntop and bottom panels show two different projections: the\ntop is a more typical projection, while the bottom, which\nkinematically hides one of the tidal tails, is more rare. By\nrare, we mean that such obscurations only occur for \u223c 1/5\nof all projection angles. While the orbit of any given dSph\nwould rule out some projection angles, when studying the\ngeneric effect of tides on all of the Local Group dSphs, it\nseems reasonable to consider such random projections.\nNotice from the middle left panels, that the primary\ncause of the rising velocity dispersion in projection is the\ncylindrical averaging which picks up both tidal tails. This\nis why, when a suitable projection is found which hides one\n\n6 Note that throughout this paper, all velocity dispersions are\ncalculated using the local mean velocity; this is in contrast to observational techniques which often use the global mean for all the\nstars. The use of the global mean is only justified where there are\nno velocity gradients measured; this is the case for the observations. It is not the case, however, for some of the models presented\nhere where velocity gradients are induced through tides.\n\n\f8\n\nRead et. al.\n\nFigure 4. Projected surface density (left), velocity (middle) and velocity dispersion (right) for models A (top) through D (bottom). The\ngrey contours show particle numbers per unit area (left) and velocities in km/s (middle). Over-plotted on the projected velocity dispersion\nplot (right) are the data for the Draco dSph galaxy taken from Wilkinson et al. (2004). The blue boxes overlaid on the contours mark\napproximate current observational limits. The projections shown are typical; different projections for model A are shown in Figure 6.\n\nof the tails, the velocity dispersion becomes flat rather than\nrising (bottom panels). In this case the velocity gradients are\nvisible (middle right panel) only at large radii. Interior to\n\u223c 1 kpc, the velocity gradient is less than \u223c 5 km/s. Such a\nsmall velocity gradient would be difficult to detect observationally (Wilkinson et al. 2004). However, even this special\nprojection is inconsistent with the data from Draco, UMi\n\nand Sextans which all show falling velocity dispersions in\nprojection (see Figure 1).\nIt is worth recalling at this point that we are not trying to explicitly model the Draco, UMi or Sextans dSphs.\nInstead we show that the generic effect of tides is to produce velocity gradients and flat or rising projected velocity\ndispersions. That this is not seen in Draco, Sextans or UMi\nsuggests that while tidal stripping may be important be-\n\n\fThe importance of tides for dSphs\n\n9\n\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\nD\n\nFigure 5. Projected surface brightness profile of the stars (left panel), velocity dispersion of the stars (middle panel) and the density\nprofile of the dark matter (right panel). Over-plotted are three theoretical tidal radii calculated as described in Read et al. (2005); the\nblue/green/red vertical lines are for the prograde/radial/retrograde tidal radii respectively. The black lines show the initial conditions,\nwhile the red lines show the evolved profiles at the output times given in Table 1. In the velocity dispersion plot, the solid, dotted and\ndashed lines show the r, \u03b8 and \u03c6 components of the velocity dispersion respectively. Models A-D are shown from top to bottom. Model\nA did not contain any dark matter which is why no plot is shown for the dark matter in this case. The tidal radius for prograde star\norbits (vertical blue line) cannot be seen for model A since it lies at very small radii (9 pc).\n\n\f10\n\nRead et. al.\n\nFigure 6. The effect of viewing projection for model A. Top panels show a typical projection; bottom panels show a rare projection\nwhich kinematically hides one of the tidal tails. From left to right panels show: projected surface density, individual projected star\nvelocities, mean projected velocity and projected velocity dispersion. The grey contours show particle numbers per unit area as in Figure\n4. Over-plotted on the projected velocity dispersion plot (right) are the data for the Draco dSph galaxy taken from Wilkinson et al.\n(2004). The blue boxes overlaid on the contours mark approximate current observational limits. Note that the velocity gradients shown\nhere are averaged over the y and z coordinates and are necessarily different to the two dimensional gradients shown in Figure 4.\n\nyond the edge of the currently observed light (\u223c1 kpc), it is\nunlikely to have been important within this radius.\nAn interesting feature of model A is that the small\npericentre of the satellite (9 kpc) causes strong tidal shocks\nwhich over 10 Gyr lower the central density of the stars by\na factor of \u223c 2. This can be seen in Figure 5, top panels.\nThese tidal shocks, as discussed in Read et al. (2005) wash\nout the tidal features which would otherwise be expected at\nthe analytic tidal radii (blue, red and green vertical lines in\nFigure 5). However, the effects of tides can still be seen in\nthe velocity dispersions. Notice that tangential anisotropy,\nwhich should be present beyond the prograde stripping radius is present at all radii over the satellite (see section 2.1).\nFor model A, the prograde stripping radius lies at just 9 pc\nand hence does not show up in Figure 5.\n\n4.2\n\nWeak tides: models B and C\n\nIn models B and C we consider the effect of weak tides on\nthe Local Group dSph galaxies. In this case we imagine that\ntides gently shape the outer regions of dSphs over a Hubble\ntime.\nIn Figure 4, second and third panels from top, we can\nsee that tides have little affected models B and C. The surface brightness distributions are nearly spherical, as in the\ninitial conditions, and there are no visible velocity gradients\nacross the galaxy. Tidal heating of the outermost stars is\npresent in both models from about \u223c 2 kpc outwards. Notice that in neither model is there a drop in the projected\n\nvelocity dispersion. The decline in model A was present in\nthe initial conditions and is not as sharp as that seen in the\ndata from Draco.\nThis can also be seen in Figure 5, second and third panels from top. Notice that, as in model A, tangential velocity\nanisotropy appears at the prograde stripping radius (vertical\nblue line) in both models B and C. Notice also the action of\ntidal shocks, particularly on the dark matter in model C. As\nthe satellite is puffed up by shocks, its velocity dispersion\nat all radii is lowered. This may seem counter-intuitive at\nfirst: the satellite is heated by tidal shocks and yet its velocity dispersion falls. However, it is the subsequent expansion\nof the satellite after the injection of energy from the tidal\nshock which causes a drop in its velocity dispersion at a\ngiven radius7 .\nNotice further that it is only in projection that the velocity dispersions appear hot beyond the tidal radius. The\ntrue velocity dispersions are still gently falling, as in the initial conditions, at this point. This occurs for two reasons.\nFirst, and this is usually the dominant effect for a given\nprojection, the cylindrically averaged tidal tails cause the\nprojected velocity dispersion to rise (see Figure 6). Second,\nthe onset of tangential anisotropy makes the outermost stars\n\n7 In projection this becomes a little more complicated since hot\nstars which have moved out to large radii can inflate the projected\nvelocity dispersion. This does not happen in practice, however, because these stars move beyond the tidal stripping radius, become\nunbound and move away from the satellite.\n\n\fThe importance of tides for dSphs\n\n11\n\nFigure 7. Histogram of the stellar velocities in a 0.2 kpc bin at 1 kpc for model B (left) and model C (right). Over-plotted are Gaussian\nfits in both cases (red lines).\n\n(ii) The dSph galaxy is on a significantly plunging orbit. The outermost stars are heated up by a disc shock as\nthe dSph plunges through the Milky Way disc. The dSph\ngalaxy then moves out towards apocentre and the hot outer\nstars escape leaving a cold population behind.\n\nspecifically selected to test this hypothesis. We choose a\ntime when the dwarf galaxy has spent a large amount of\ntime away from the Milky Way disc and the outermost stars\nheated by the last passage have had time to escape. The\nhypothesis is falsified for three reasons. First, for the case\nof models B and C, tidal shocking replenishes stars beyond\nthe tidal radius and so there is always a source of hot\ntidal stars which mask any cold populations. Secondly, the\nimage of a sharp edge to the satellite beyond which a cold\npopulation of stars might exist is not correct. As shown in a\ncompanion paper (Read et al. 2005; and see also section 2),\nthe tidal radius of the satellite depends on the orbit of the\nstars within the satellite. This leads to a continuum of tidal\nradii and, therefore, no sharp edge to the satellite. Finally,\neven if there were such a sharp edge, and tidal shocking did\nnot refill stars beyond the tidal radius, there would be on\naverage more stars on circular orbits than radial orbits at\nthe tidal radius and the distribution would still appear hot\nin projection. We explicitly checked that this is indeed the\ncase by considering some more extreme orbits with very\nlarge apocentres (260 kpc), and pericentres large enough to\nmake the effect of tidal shocking negligible (35 kpc). Even\nin these cases the projected velocity dispersions are flat or\nrising, for the reasons presented above. As a final check, we\nconsidered also only the bound stars. Plotting only these\nremoves the hot tidal tail, but still does not lead to cold\nouter stars in projection.\nWe conclude that if such cold outer populations in\ndSph galaxies are real then they cannot have formed as\na result of tidal effects which always produce stars which\nappear hot in projection.\n\nThis hypothesis was presented in Wilkinson et al. (2004)\nand formed one of the motivations for this current work.\nThe output time chosen for models B and C has been\n\n(iii) The velocity distribution of the outer-most stars\nis highly non-Gaussian, with a significant tail of high\nvelocity stars. This could lead to a large fraction of stars\n\nappear hot in projection. This second effect is only important when the tidal tails are viewed along the line of sight,\nthereby minimising the extent to which they can be observed\nin projection.\nThis is interesting: in all models tidal stripping leads\nto a rising or flat projected velocity dispersion. There is\nnever a sharp decline such as that observed in the Draco,\nUMi and Sextans dSphs (see section 1). We now discuss\nwhy tidal stripping always leads to hot stars in projection\nby considering three mechanisms by which tidal stripping\nmight have led instead to the opposite - namely a cold\nouter point in the projected velocity dispersion.\n(i) The outer-most point is the result of a chance projection effect between the galaxy and its tidal tail along the\nline of sight.\nWe explicitly checked for this by searching over 5 degree projections every half orbital period for both models B\nand C and found no sharp features at any output time. If a\nprojection effect could cause such a sharp drop it would be\nvery rare and, while one could envisage this for one Local\nGroup dSph galaxy, the fact that such a sharp feature\nhas been observed in at least three renders this possibility\nunlikely.\n\n\f12\n\nRead et. al.\n\nbeing deemed non-members of the dSph galaxy and excluded\nfrom the data analysis, leading to a spurious detection of a\ncold outer point.\nTo test this hypothesis, we plot the distribution of\nline of sight velocities in a 0.2 kpc-wide bin at a projected\nradius of 1 kpc for models B and C (Figure 7). Over-plotted\nare Gaussian fits to the binned data in both cases (red\nlines). The distributions are close to Gaussian: neither\nshows a strong asymmetric tail. Similar results were found\nat other radii. We conclude that it is unlikely that a\nsignificant fraction of high velocity stars would be excluded\nas members of Draco from an observational data analysis.\n4.3\n\nStrong tidal shocking: model D\n\nIn model D, we consider the hypothesis that the progenitors\nof dSph galaxies were much more massive than they appear\nat the present time. As can be seen in models A, B and C,\nthe action of tidal shocks puffs up the satellite and lowers\nthe velocity dispersion at all radii. In model D, we start with\na satellite which has a very large central velocity dispersion\nwhich is not consistent with current data from the Local\nGroup dSphs. We consider the case where this velocity dispersion is lowered over time by the action of tidal shocks\nsuch that it becomes consistent with current data now.\nAs we showed in section 2.2, it is possible to find a\nregime where tidal shocks dominate over stripping interior\nto the stars. The existence of such a regime is demonstrated\nnumerically by model D.\nIn Figure 4, bottom panels, we can see that the satellite\nhas been little affected by tidal stripping inside \u223c 1 kpc. It\nretains smooth spherical contours and shows no strong velocity gradients. Beyond \u223c 1 kpc, tidal stripping becomes\nsignificant and the outer stars appear hot in projection.\nHowever, in Figure 5, we can see that tidal shocking has\nbeen much more important than the stripping over a Hubble time. The central density of the dark matter has lowered\nby a factor of \u223c 10, and similarly for the stars. The velocity\ndispersion of the stars is lower at all radii, but notice that\nthe central value is still high - similar to the initial conditions. This reflects the presence initially of a central dark\nmatter cusp. This allows the density at the centre of the\nsatellite to become high enough that tidal shocking is less\neffective, even over very long timescales and for this extreme\norbit (recall that the satellite pericentre for model D is just\n6 kpc). Finally, notice that despite such strong tidal shocks,\nthe central dark matter cusp persists, albeit at a lower normalisation. This agrees with findings from previous authors\n(Kazantzidis et al. 2004). It is this central dark matter cusp\nwhich leaves the satellite with a central velocity dispersion\nwhich is too large to be consistent with data from any of\nthe Local Group dSphs observed so far. In a similar model\nwhich we ran with a central dark matter core instead of a\ncusp, much better agreement was obtained. We will return\nto this issue in section 5.\nIn model D, as in models A and C, the satellite loses significant mass over a Hubble time as a result of tidal stripping\nand shocking. This is shown in Figure 8, where we compare\nthe bound mass as a function of time for each of the models A-D. At the output time shown, the bound mass of the\nsatellite in model D has been reduced by a factor of \u223c 10.\n\nFigure 8. Total bound mass (stars and dark matter) as a function\nof time for models A-D.\n\nThis explains why the final velocity dispersion matches the\ndata from Draco, while the initial dispersions were much\ntoo high. Such mass loss continues steadily over the whole\nsimulation time due to the action of shocks.\n\n5\n5.1\n\nDISCUSSION\nSagittarius: a tidally stripped dSph galaxy\n\nWe know of one Local Group dSph which is definitely undergoing tidal stripping: the Sagittarius dwarf (Ibata et al. 2001\nand Law et al. 2005). Its tidal streams are quite cold, giving a flat velocity dispersion of \u223c 10 km/s (Law et al. 2005),\nconsistent with its central value (Ibata et al. 1997). Furthermore the velocity gradients across its minor axis (\u00b11 kpc)\nseem to be only \u223c 3 km/s (Ibata et al. 1997)8 .\nOlszewski (1998) and Ibata et al. (1997) have argued\nthat these data for the Sagittarius dwarf must imply large\namounts of dark matter, similar to the other dSphs, such\nthat the effects of tides become hard to detect within the\nbody of the Sagittarius dSph. An alternative view is that\neven strong tides do not produce measurable effects in the\nkinematics, even out to radii which begin to sample the tidal\ntails. As we have shown in this paper, this second view is possible if Sagittarius is favourably aligned (see Figure 6). One\nmight speculate that the other dSphs could be undergoing\ntidal disruption but the signs of it are masked in projection.\nSuch favourable alignments seem unlikely to be the case for\nall of the Local Group dSphs. Furthermore, in at least three\ndSphs (UMi, Draco and Sextans), the velocity dispersion is\n8 The major axis results are not available in the published literature. It is possible that large velocity gradients may be discovered\nin future along the major axis, consistent with strong tides.\n\n\fThe importance of tides for dSphs\n\n13\n\nactually falling. This is inconsistent with strong tidal effects\ninterior to \u223c 1kpc.\n5.2\n\nThe tidal model\n\nKroupa (1997) found that tidal models for the formation of\ndSphs without dark matter can reproduce the spatial and\nkinematic observations. Central to such models is the idea\nthat the dSph galaxy starts out as a high density star cluster. Through tidal shocking and stripping the star cluster is\nheated up and becomes almost completely unbound. In such\na scenario, high projected velocity dispersions are to be expected (c.f. model A). However, these do not correspond to a\nlarge mass for the satellite since the tidally heated stars are\nnot bound and the Jeans equations or distribution function\nmodelling do not apply.\nIn our simulations, we find similar results to those presented in Kroupa (1997). Kroupa (1997) also finds rising\n(cylindrically averaged) projected velocity dispersions for\ntidally stripped and shocked dSphs (see their Figure 10). It\nis the new data from the Local Group dSphs, which were not\navailable to Kroupa (1997), that rule out these dark matter\nfree tidal models, not an improvement in the simulations.\nEven using favourable projections (as in Figure 6), it is not\npossible to have a falling projected velocity dispersion in the\ntidal model - a result which concords with other studies of\nthe tidal model too (see e.g. Fleck & Kuhn 2003).\nPiatek & Pryor (1995) also argued against a dark matter free tidal origin for the dSphs. They found significant\nvelocity gradients in their simulations which were inconsistent with observations. As in Kroupa (1997), we find that\nit is possible to hide such velocity gradients using suitable\nprojections. Thus it is the existence of cold outer populations in projection which provide the hardest challenge for\nsuch tidal models, rather than the velocity gradients alone.\nFinally, for Draco, Klessen et al. (2003) showed that\nthe tidal model will not work since Draco cannot be very\nextended along the line of sight (something which is required in any projection which disguises the velocity gradients and significant tidal tails, but in which the velocity dispersion is inflated due the inclusion (in projection) of stars\nfrom the tidal tails). Through detailed modelling of Draco,\nMashchenko et al. (2005) also find that the tidal model is\nnot favourable. Here, we confirm these results, and extend\nthe list of tidal stripping-free dwarfs to include UMi and\nSextans.\n5.3\n\nMass bounds from tides\n\nIt is interesting to now turn the problem of the cold outer\nstars in Draco, Sextans and UMi on its head. The presence\nof such stars tells us that either the tidal radius must lie beyond this point, or that the cold point was formed recently\nand has not had time to be disrupted by tides. The latter\nseems unlikely: Draco and UMi have very old stellar popula>\ntions ( \u223c\n10 Gyrs), which suggests that any baryonic process\nwhich might cause such a cold point must have occurred long\nago. As such, in this section, we discuss the implications of\n>\nthese Local Group dSphs having tidal radii \u223c\n0.8 kpc, which\nis the current observational edge for kinematic observations\nin these galaxies. For brevity from here on, we use the term\n'Local Group dSphs' to mean Draco, UMi and Sextans.\n\nFigure 9. A lower mass bound on the Local Group dSphs as\na function of their orbital pericentres. The red line is for highly\neccentric dSph orbits (e = 1) while the black is for circular orbits\n(e = 0). The mass limits were obtained from the prograde tidal\nradius (see equation 1 with \u03b1 = 1). Also marked is the approximate lower bound on the mass obtained from stellar kinematics\nand distribution function models for Draco (black dashed line;\nand see Kleyna et al. 2001). UMi and Sextans have similar lower\nbounds.\n\nFrom Figures 4 and 5, we can see that the tidal heating\nof stars starts at the prograde stripping radius (this is where\nthe tangential velocity anisotropy begins - see section 2.1\nand Read et al. 2005). Thus from here on, by 'tidal radius'\nwe refer to the prograde stripping radius.\nThe tidal radius is a function of the satellite and Milky\nWay potentials, and the orbit of the satellite. However, assuming point masses leads to, at most, errors of the order of\n2-3 in the prograde tidal radius (Read et al. 2005). Thus, rearranging equation 1 should give us a reasonable lower bound\non the mass of Local Group dSphs within the tidal radius,\nas a function of their orbital pericentre. This is plotted in\nFigure 9. It is a lower bound because the tidal radius must\nbe greater than the outermost measured kinematic point\n(in order to preserve a cold outer point) in the Local Group\ndSphs, which we take to be \u223c 0.8 kpc.\nSince we have shown that tidal stripping is not likely to\nact interior to \u223c 0.8 kpc in at least Draco, UMi and Sextans,\nthis suggests that these galaxies are close to equilibrium and\na mass bound from the Jeans equations or distribution function modelling is sound. What, then, can we learn from a\nmass bound from tides which is degenerate with the orbit\nof the dSph and the potential of the Milky Way, both of\nwhich are poorly constrained? From Figure 9, we can see\nthat, if the orbital pericentre of the Local Group dSphs is\n>\n\u223c 30 kpc, then we learn nothing new from the tidal mass\nbound: tidal stripping and shocking are both negligible for\n>\nall satellite masses \u223c\n108 M\u2299 - the mass bound obtained\nfrom distribution function modelling. However, if the peri<\ncentre of the orbit is \u223c\n30kpc, then the satellite must have\n\n\f14\n\nRead et. al.\n\nbeen more massive in the past than it is at present in order to have survived intact on its current orbit. Thus for\nsmall pericentre orbits, the tidal mass bound is a bound on\nthe dSph's initial mass, before tidal stripping and shocking.\nThat it is now less massive than this then means that tidal\nshocking must have acted to lower the central mass and velocity dispersion over a Hubble time (as in models C and\nD).\n5.4\n\nCan dSphs reside in the most massive\nsubstructure halos?\n\nThe dark matter halo in model D had a total mass of\n1010 M\u2299 , consistent with the most massive dark matter halos\npredicted by cosmological simulations to surround the Milky\nWay (Klypin et al. 1999). The initial mass within 0.8 kpc for\nmodel D was 109 M\u2299 , while after significant tidal shocking on\nits extreme orbit (with pericentre of 6.5 kpc), the final mass\nwithin 0.8 kpc was \u223c 108 M\u2299 . This final mass is consistent\nwith current mass estimates for Draco, UMi and Sextans,\nbut its concentration is not. The survival of the central dark\nmatter density cusp in model D ensured that the central velocity dispersion of the surviving dSph galaxy was too large,\neven after extreme tidal shocking.\nInterestingly, there may be tentative evidence that the\nUMi dSph has a centrally cored dark matter density profile,\nrather than a cusp (Kleyna et al. 2003). If this is the case\nthen it is possible that UMi started out with total mass\n1010 M\u2299 and had its velocity dispersion lowered through the\naction of tidal shocks. With a central dark matter density\ncore, rather than a cusp, such shocks can lower even the central velocity dispersion to 10 km/s in accord with the measured values for the Local Group dSphs. Thus it is only possible for the dSphs to inhabit the most massive substructure\nhalos if they have density profiles which are not consistent\nwith simple cosmological predictions.\nA natural consequence of such strong tidal shocking is\nthat we can expect a correlation between the central surface brightness of the Local Group dSphs and their pericentre: dSphs which pass closer to their host galaxies will\nshow lower central surface brightnesses. While the orbits\nof the Local Group dSphs remain poorly constrained and\nso their pericentres are not well known, a correlation between central surface brightness and distance to the nearest\nhost galaxy has been observed (Bellazzini et al. 1996 and\nMcconnachie & Irwin 2005). While there are many possible\nexplanations for such a correlation (for example selection\neffects), a plausible explanation would be tidal shocking.\nFinally, tidal shocks could provide the necessary physics\nto remove angular momentum from the dSphs and transform\nthem from an initially disc-like population to a spheroidal\npopulation as in Mayer et al. (2001a) and Mayer et al.\n(2001b). We argue in this paper that the Local Group dSphs\nhave not been significantly stripped interior to 1 kpc, but this\nneed not invalidate the tidal transformation model proposed\nby Mayer et al. (2001a).\n\n6\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have compared the results from a suite of N-body simulations of the tidal stripping and shocking of two-component,\n\nspherical, dwarf galaxies in orbit around a Milky Way like\ngalaxy, with recently obtained kinematic data for the Local\nGroup dwarf spheroidals (dSphs).\nOur main findings are summarised below:\n(i) Tidal stripping always leads to flat or rising projected velocity dispersions beyond a critical radius; it is\n\u223c 5 times more likely, over random projections, that the\ncylindrically averaged projected dispersion will rise than be\nflat.\n(ii) In several of the dSphs observed so far, there appears to be a sharp fall-off in the projected velocity\ndispersion at large radii. If such a feature is real and not a\nstatistical artifact, it would be rapidly destroyed by tidal\nstripping - tidal stripping cannot have acted interior to the\ncurrently visible light in these galaxies (interior to \u223c 1 kpc).\n(iii) By contrast, there exists a regime in which tidal\nshocking can be important interior to the visible light, even\nwhen tidal stripping is not. This could explain the observed\ncorrelation for the Local Group dSphs between central\nsurface brightness and distance from the nearest large\ngalaxy (Bellazzini et al. 1996 and Mcconnachie & Irwin\n2005).\n(iv) It is possible for dSphs to reside within the most\nmassive substructure dark matter halos (\u223c 1010 M\u2299 ) and\nhave their velocity dispersions lowered through the action\nof tidal shocks, but only if they have a central density\ncore in their dark matter, rather than a cusp. A central\ndensity cusp persists even after unrealistically extreme tidal\nshocking and leads to central velocity dispersions which are\ntoo high to be consistent with data from the Local Group\ndSphs. dSphs can reside within cuspy dark matter halos if\ntheir halos are less massive (\u223c 109 M\u2299 ) and therefore have\nsmaller central velocity dispersions initially.\n(v) A tidal origin for the formation of the Local Group\ndSphs in which they contain no dark matter is strongly\ndisfavoured. This is because such a formation scenario\nrequires very strong tidal stripping, the effects of which are\nat odds with the latest data from the Local Group dSphs.\n\n7\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nJIR and MIW would like to thank PPARC for grants which\nhave supported this research.
