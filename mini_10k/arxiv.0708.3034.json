The characterization of electric arc furnace (EAF) dust shows that bubble burst at the liquid steel\nsurface is the principal source of dust emission. We have therefore developed an experimental device for\nstudying this phenomenon. As in the case of the air-water system, the bubble-burst gives birth to two types of\ndroplets: film drops and jet drops. The jet drop formation is observed with high-speed video. The film drop\naerosol is collected on filters and, then, characterized by means of SEM, granulometric and gravimetric analyses.\nResults are presented and discussed. The quantification of both types of projections leads to the conclusion that\nthe film drop projections represent the major source of dust. The amount of film drops greatly decreases with the\nparent bubble size. Under 4.5 mm in bubble diameter, no film drops are formed. Decreasing enough the bubble\nsize would therefore represent an effective solution for reducing drastically the EAF dust emission.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe Electric Arc Furnace (EAF), designed for steelmaking from recycled scrap iron (see\nfigure 1), also co-produces between 15 to 25 kg of dust per ton of steel. Dust formation is\nstrongly linked to the process which can be divided into five steps:\n- furnace charging: the scrap and the additives (lime, coal...) are loaded into special\ncharging buckets which are then emptied into the furnace;\n- melting: an electric arc is created between the graphite electrodes and the scrap which\nentails the charge melting and the formation of a steel bath covered by a slag layer,\nvolatile solute species (e.g. zinc) begin to be removed;\n- refining: in this step of the process, phosphorus is removed from the steel bath by\ninterfacial reactions between the slag and the liquid metal, injection of oxygen\npromotes the decarburization reaction with dissolved carbon and bubbles of carbon\nmonoxide (CO) are formed, which helps to remove other dissolved gases;\n- slag foaming: the CO-bubbles crossing the slag layer make it foam, the foaming\nprocess being enhanced by the addition of coal powder;\n- casting: after the composition and the temperature of the bath have been controlled,\nthe liquid steel is cast.\nDuring the process, the fumes are extracted through an aperture in the furnace roof. These are\npost-combusted, cooled, and cleaned from the transported dust, which is collected in large bag\nfilters. This dust contains hazardous, leachable elements such as zinc, lead or cadmium which\nrequire EAF dust to be stored in specific landfills.\nIn order to propose economically feasible solutions for both recycling and/or reducing EAF\ndust, the understanding of the dust formation is necessary. The present paper describes the\ndifferent mechanisms of formation identified thanks to a morphological and mineralogical\ncharacterization of various dust samples, and then focuses on the study of the main source of\nemission, i.e. bubble burst at the surface of the liquid bath. An original experimental device\nwas designed in order to understand and quantify precisely this phenomenon. The results of\nthe experimental study are presented and discussed.\n\n1\n\n\fPublished in Powder Technology, 2005, 157, 1-3, 2-11.\n\nFigure 1. Schematic representation of an Electric Arc Furnace\n\nCHARACTERIZATION OF ELECTRIC ARC FURNACE DUST\nThe investigations regarding the morphology and mineralogy of the particles contained in\nEAF dust give useful information for the identification of the dust formation mechanisms.\nSeveral dust samples coming from different industrial furnaces were observed by SEM\n(Scanning Electron Microscopy) and analyzed by EDS (Energy Dispersive Spectrometry). As\nshown in figure 2, EAF dust particles cover a wide range of sizes. To simplify the survey of\nthe morphologies, we distinguished two categories of particles: large particles from a few\ndozen to a few thousand micrometres, and finer particles lower than 20 \u03bcm.\n\nFigure 2. EAF dust\n1. Large particles\nThree morphological types belong to this category. The first one is composed of particles of\ncoal and lime (figures 3 and 4). Their sizes vary between 20 and 500 \u03bcm and their shapes are\nirregular. This morphology indicates they come from the direct fly-off of solid particles\nduring the introduction of powder materials into the EAF (scrap, coal for slag foaming,\nadditions, recycled dust, etc.).\n\n2\n\n\fPublished in Powder Technology, 2005, 157, 1-3, 2-11.\n\nFigure 3. Coal particle\n\nFigure 4. Lime particle\n\nThe second one is made up of sphere-like particles whose sizes range from 20 to 200 \u03bcm\n(figure 5). Their chemical composition corresponds to that of the slag (Ca, Al, Fe, Si...). They\nprobably result from a phenomenon of liquid droplets projection at the impact points of the\narc or of the oxygen jet on the liquid bath.\n\nFigure 5. Sphere-like particle whose composition corresponds to that of the slag\nThe third morphological type corresponds to agglomerates of fine particles (figure 6)\nsimilar to those presented in the following part. Their sizes vary between 20 and 1000 \u03bcm.\nThey are fragile and break up easily. Thus, these particles are likely formed by lowtemperature agglomeration (e.g. in filters).\n\nFigure 6. Large agglomerates of fine particles\n\n3\n\n\fPublished in Powder Technology, 2005, 157, 1-3, 2-11.\nContrary to the agglomerates of fine particles, the first two types of particles are hardly\npresent or even completely absent from the dust samples. Their presence suggests an\nexcessive fume extraction flow rate or a bad control of the melting and addition processes.\n2. Fine particles\nFine particles, whose sizes are below 20 \u03bcm, account for the major part of EAF dust. A small\nproportion of those particles corresponds to monocristals of zinc oxide (figure 7). They are\neasily identifiable thanks to their facetted aspect. Their size rarely exceeds a few hundred\nnanometres.\n\nFigure 7. Zincite monocristals\nThe other particles are spherical. Their size varies from 0.2 to 20 \u03bcm. We found three types\nof spheres which differ from each other because of their mineralogy:\n\uf0b7 homogeneous spheres whose composition corresponds either to the slag or to the steel\nbath with an enrichment in zinc; they are often hollow when they are larger than 2 or\n3 \u03bcm (figure 8);\n\uf0b7 heterogeneous spheres made up of a slag phase and a steel phase enriched in zinc\n(figure 9); some of them display an iron-rich dendritic structure buried inside a\nvitreous phase;\n\uf0b7 submicronic spheres of pure zincite.\n0.2 \u03bcm\n\nFigure 8. Several full spheres and one\nhollow sphere\n\nFigure 9. Heterogeneous sphere\n\n4\n\n\fPublished in Powder Technology, 2005, 157, 1-3, 2-11.\nThe zincite spheres, like the monocristals, form during the condensation of the vapors of\nzinc contained in the EAF fumes [1, 2]. The other spheres represent the major part of the dust\nobserved. They come from the projection of liquid droplets. On account of their sizes, they\nare thought to be emitted by the burst of CO-bubbles coming from the decarburization of the\nsteel bath [1, 3, 4, 5].\nThe finest particles, whose sizes are lower than 2 or 3 \u03bcm, are frequently agglomerated to\neach other or around a bigger particle (figure 10). The sizes of these agglomerates vary from 5\nto 20 \u03bcm; a few of them reach 50 \u03bcm and some show signs of partial sintering also noted by\nCruells et al. [6]. In this case, the agglomeration took place inside the furnace or the fume\nextraction ducts at high temperature.\n\nFigure 10. Agglomerates of fine particles\nI.3. Interpretation\nThe dust collected in bag filters at the end of the EAF fume extraction system is the final\nproduct of a series of phenomena, such as the emission of particles from the steel bath, the\ntransport of these particles by the gas flow in the fume extraction system, the in-flight\nphysico-chemical transformations they undergo, etc. The results of the morphological analysis\nof the EAF dust show that the dust formation process takes place in two steps: first, the\nemission of dust \"precursors\", i.e. vapors, metal droplets, and solid particles, inside the\nfurnace; second, the conversion of those precursors into dust by agglomeration and physicochemical transformations.\nFrom the different types of particles displayed previously, five emission mechanisms of\ndust precursors have been identified (see figure 11):\n\uf0b7 volatilization, especially localized at the hot spots in the arc zone (1) and the oxygen\njet zone (1'), but taking place as well in the CO bubbles;\n\uf0b7 projection of droplets at the impact points of the arc (2) and of the oxygen jet (2') on\nthe steel bath;\n\uf0b7 projection of fine droplets by bursting of CO bubbles (3) coming from the\ndecarburization of the steel bath;\n\uf0b7 bursting of droplets (4) in contact with an oxidizing atmosphere within the surface; the\noccurrence of this phenomenon, which can be classed as a bubble-burst mechanism, is\nuncertain in EAF;\n\uf0b7 direct fly-off of solid particles (5) during the introduction of powder materials into the\nEAF (scrap, coal for slag foaming, additions, recycled dust, etc.).\n\n5\n\n\fPublished in Powder Technology, 2005, 157, 1-3, 2-11.\n\nFigure 11. Schematic representation of the mechanisms of dust emission in EAF\nAccording to the preceding analysis and experimental quantifications of each mechanism\nmade by Birat et al. [7], the prevailing mechanisms of dust precursor emission appear to be\nthe volatilization (27 % of the dust) and the bursting of CO bubbles (60 % of the dust). The\ndirect fly-off of solid particles remains very limited if sufficient operating cautions are taken.\nAs for the projections at the impact points of the arc or of the oxygen jet, most of them fail to\nbe carried up by the fume extraction system, due to their size, and fall back into the liquid\nbath.\nThe precursors are further transformed during their transport within the furnace and then in\nthe fume extraction system. They can undergo physical transformations: condensation of the\nvapors, rapid solidification of the fine projections in contact with a colder atmosphere, inflight agglomeration and coalescence of dust particles. The precursors can also be modified\nby chemical reactions (e.g. oxidation) with the carrier gas, whose temperature and\ncomposition vary, and, they can possibly react with other precursor particles. For a reaction\nbetween condensed phases (liquid or solid) to occur, particles must first be brought into\ncontact. Therefore, there is a strong link between the mechanisms of agglomeration and the\nchemical evolution [8].\n\nDUST FORMATION BY BUBBLE BURSTING\n1. Theory\nThe projection of liquid steel and slag droplets by bursting of CO bubbles has been\nrecognized as the principal mechanism of dust emission in EAF. Very few studies about\nbubble-burst at the surface of liquid metal have been reported [9]. However, in order to\nunderstand the phenomenon, useful results and observations can be found in the abundant\nliterature about the air-water system. From these studies, the bubble-burst process can be split\nup into three steps which give rise to two types of droplets (figure 12).\n\n6\n\n\fPublished in Powder Technology, 2005, 157, 1-3, 2-11.\n\nFigure 12. Schematic representation of the burst of a bubble on a liquid surface\nWhen emerging at the surface (figure 12a), a bubble lifts up a liquid film that progressively\ngets thinner under the influence of drainage, when the bubble comes to rest. The shape of a\nbubble floating at the surface of a liquid can be determined by following the approach\nproposed by Unger et al. [10].\nAs the film reaches a critical thickness, it breaks up and the bubble cap is disintegrated into\nfine droplets called film drops (figure 12b). Many authors [11, 12, 13, 14] studied the number\nand size of film drops as a function of the bubble size. The number is proportional to the\nsurface of the film. The size distribution is wide: from 0.3 to 500 \u03bcm.\nAfter the disruption of the bubble cap, the cavity remaining at the liquid surface closes up,\ncreating an upward Rayleigh jet that is unstable and can break up into droplets usually called\njet drops (figure 12c). The number of jet drops never exceeds ten and decreases when the\nbubble size increases [11, 14]. Their sizes have been found to range between 0.1 and 0.18\ntimes the diameter of their parent bubble for air-water system [15, 16].\n2. Experimental apparatus\nIn order to study dust emission from bubble burst in liquid steel, we set up an original\nexperimental device (figure 13) using a vacuum induction melting furnace (Leybold)\nmodified in order to operate at atmospheric pressure under an argon atmosphere. The aims of\nthe experiments are to clarify the way the bubbles burst at a liquid steel bath surface and to\nquantify the resulting emissions, i.e. film drops and jet drops.\nThe steel charge (750 g of a commercial steel grade XC38) is melted in an alumina\ncrucible (45 mm inside diameter, 70 mm height), fitted in a graphite susceptor. This\nconfiguration reduces electromagnetic convection in the metal bath. The temperature of the\nliquid steel is controlled by a bichromatic pyrometer; during an experiment, the temperature\nof the bath is maintained constant, usually at a value between 1600 and 1650 \u00b0C.\nThe gas injection device consists of an alumina tube (7 mm outside diameter, 4 mm inside\ndiameter, 300 mm length), fed with gas through a stainless steel tube, which is connected,\noutside the furnace, to a mass flow controller and the argon cylinder. The bubbles form at the\nmouth of an alumina capillary inserted into the injection tube. In order to change the bubble\nsize, we use three different sizes of alumina capillaries (outer diameter: 0.5, 1.2 or 3 mm).\nMoreover, for a given capillary, the gas flowrate can be modified (between 1 cm3 min-1 and\n15 cm3 min-1) as well as the pressure drop, which enables us to vary the bubble size in a wide\nrange, between 4 and 13 mm (all bubble sizes indicated in the present paper are equivalent\nvolume diameters).\n\n7\n\n\fPublished in Powder Technology, 2005, 157, 1-3, 2-11.\n\nFigure 13. Schematic representation of the experimental device\nThe bursting of bubbles at the surface and the formation of the jet drops are observed by\nmeans of a high-speed video camera (Kodak Motion Corder) which makes it possible to film\nthe bath surface at a rate up to 10 000 frames per second. Actually, good-quality images could\nnot be obtained at such a rate because increasing the shooting frequency entails a reduction in\nimage resolution. We therefore selected rates of 5000 frames s-1 to record the film break and\n1000 frames s-1 to observe the formation of the jet drops and to determine the frequency of\nemergence of the gas bubbles at the surface. The latter frequency is equal to the frequency of\nthe bubble formation at the capillary mouth and thus permits to calculate the bubble size\nknowing the gas flowrate.\nIn order to study the film drops, the aerosol formed is exhausted through a rack-mounted\ntube. The airborne particles are collected on filters inserted in an in-line stainless steel filter\nholder connected to a flowmeter and a vacuum pump. Two types of filters were used: glass\nfiber filter (Millipore) for the gravimetric analysis of the particles and PVC membranes\n(Millipore) for the granulometric analysis and the SEM observation. In order to prevent the\nsaturation of the filters, the exhaust period is limited to 15 seconds for one filter. The flowrate\nis 4.39\uf0b410-4 Nm3 s-1, which corresponds to a gas velocity of 0.4 m s-1 at 500 K (typical gas\ntemperature above the bath). According to the Stokes law, it enables to carry particles up to\n60 \u03bcm in diameter, a size which is larger than that of most of particles contained in the EAF\ndust. Almost all the particles collected on the filters can be regarded as coming from the steel\nbath. Indeed, it is possible to remove most of the parasitic particles present in the atmosphere\nof the furnace by sweeping it with filtered gas. At the beginning of each experiment, the\nfurnace is pumped out and then fed with filtered argon. After one hour of sweeping, there\nremains in the furnace less than 100 particles with diameters larger than 0.3 \u03bcm for 28.3 L of\ngas and none of these particles have a diameter above 1 \u03bcm. Thanks to these experimental\nprecautions, it is possible to obtain a sufficient cleanness of the furnace in order to ensure an\naccurate determination of the emissions coming from the steel bath.\n3. Results\n3.1. Bubble bursting mechanisms\nThe analysis of the video sequences reveals that the mechanisms involved in bubble bursting\non the free surface of liquid steel are similar to those occurring with air-water systems. Note\nthat no film drops could be observed on the video sequences, due to their smallness and the\nlimited image resolution (one pixel corresponds to 180-200 \u03bcm). Nevertheless, their existence\nis confirmed by the SEM observation of the particles collected on the filters. Two types of\n\n8\n\n\fPublished in Powder Technology, 2005, 157, 1-3, 2-11.\nsampling were made: with bubbling and without bubbling (i.e. bubbling is turned off for a\nwhile). The samples with bubbling show the presence of sphere-like particles (figure 14), with\ndiameters from 0.5 to 40 \u03bcm, which do not appear in the samples collected without bubbling.\nSpherical particles in this size range are of the type, predominant in EAF dust, attributed , in\nthe literature (see part I), to liquid droplet projections. In the present case, these particles are\nsolidified film drops.\n\nFigure 14. Several film drops collected in the experimental device\nUnlike the film drops, the projection of jet drops can be observed on the video frames.\nFigure 15 shows the formation of an upward liquid jet and the projection of one jet drop after\na bubble burst at the surface of the liquid steel.\n\nFigure 15. Frames taken from a video sequence at 1000 frames per second (a: bubble\nemerging at the bath surface; b: disruption of the bubble cap; c, d: formation of an upward\nliquid jet; e: emission of a jet drop)\n3.2. Characterization of jet drops\nThe analysis of video frames is a reliable means to determine precisely the number of ejected\njet drops. The results, reported in figure 16, are consistent with those presented in the\nliterature: the probability of jet drop formation, and thus the number of jet drops per bubble,\nincreases as the size of the parent bubble decreases.\nBy analogy with the correlations proposed by Blanchard [17] and Wu [16] in the case of\nair-water systems, we derived an exponential law giving the number of ejected drops per\nbubble (Njet) as a function of the bubble diameter (dB, expressed in mm):\nN jet \uf03d 43.4 exp(-0.58 d B )\n\nThe coefficients were calculated by regression from the experimental results (figure 16).\n\n9\n\n\fPublished in Powder Technology, 2005, 157, 1-3, 2-11.\n\nFigure 16. Number of jet drops versus bubble size\nIf the number of jet drops can be determined on the basis of the video sequences, it is much\nmore difficult to measure their sizes because of the poor resolution of the images.\nNevertheless, these images show that the jet drops observed are not exhausted by the fume\nextraction device and fall back into the bath or around the crucible. In order to determine their\nsizes, the particles gathered around the crucible at the end of each experiment are collected\nand weighed. These particles are dense metal spheres. From this method, we obtain the size\ndistribution of the jet drops projected during the experiment. The median diameter of each\ndistribution is used in order to characterize the jet drop populations. The results obtained for\nbubble sizes ranging from 5.5 to 10 mm are reported in figure 17; the jet drop size is\nproportionnal to the size of the parent bubbles (between 12 and 18 % of the bubble diameter).\n\nFigure 17. Size of jet drops versus bubble size\n3.3. Characterization of film drops\nTo quantify the film drop emission, we analysed aerosols collected during experiments with\nand without bubbling, using granulometric and gravimetric techniques. Without bubbling, the\nparticles detected come from the vaporization of the steel charge which is clearly visible in\nthe form of fumes inside the furnace.\n\n10\n\n\fPublished in Powder Technology, 2005, 157, 1-3, 2-11.\nGranulometric analyses of the experimental dust samples were performed by wet laser\ndiffraction. The Coulter LS 130 granulometer used gives the volume distribution of a\nsuspension of particles ranging from 0.04 \u03bcm to 2.103 \u03bcm. Dust collected on membranes is\ndispersed in pure ethyl alcohol and desagglomerated by ultrasonic and mechanic agitation\nfollowing the procedure described in figure 18. Such a procedure leads to an optimal\ndesagglomeration of the particles and a good reproducibility of the measurements.\n\nFigure 18. Procedure for the preparation of the particle suspension and for the granulometric\nanalysis\nFigure 19 shows the typical results of a granulometric analysis of two kinds of dust\nsamples (with and without bubbling). They confirm the existence of two particle populations:\nsubmicronic particles coming from the vaporization of the liquid steel, and film drops.\nConcerning the first population, we do not have yet a satisfactory explanation for the presence\nof three modes. The important feature in the figure is the apparition of the biggest particles in\nthe sample collected with bubbling.\n\nFigure 19. Size distribution of two dust samples collected with and without bubble bursting\n(bubble diameter: 7 mm)\nFrom such granulometric results and knowing the amount of dust collected with and\nwithout bubbling (see below), it is possible to obtain the size distribution of film drops by\n11\n\n\fPublished in Powder Technology, 2005, 157, 1-3, 2-11.\n\"substracting\" both types of results. Figure 20 presents the distributions obtained for three\nbubble sizes. It can be seen that the size spectrum broadens up when the bubble size increases,\neven if most of the film drops remain under 20 \u03bcm, as in EAF dust samples. This\nphenomenon is confirmed by the SEM observation of the samples.\n\nFigure 20. Size distribution of film drops produced by bubble bursting.\nBubble diameter: a) 8.3 mm, b) 10.2 mm, c) 12.5 mm\nThe mass of particles collected was determined by weighing of the glass fiber filters before\nand after each experiment. The difference between the results of the experiments with- and\n\n12\n\n\fPublished in Powder Technology, 2005, 157, 1-3, 2-11.\nwithout bubbling gives the mass of film drops collected. The results are gathered in table 1;\nfor an easier and more meaningful comparison, the amounts have been referred to one bubble\nburst (MB in table 1) and to the volume of injected gas (MG in table 1).\nTable 1. Mass of film drops as a function of the parent bubble size\ndB (bubble size) MB (mass of projections for one\nMG (mass of projections for 1 m3 of\nbubble burst)\ninjected gas)\n4 mm\nnot detected\n< 1 g/m3\n4.6 mm\nnot detected\n< 1 g/m3\n7.2 mm\n3.75 \u03bcg/bubble\n19.2 g/m3\n9.1 mm\n10.1 \u03bcg/bubble\n25.6 g/m3\n10.7 mm\n18.9 \u03bcg/bubble\n29.5 g/m3\n12.6 mm\n30.3 \u03bcg/bubble\n29 g/m3\nThe results clearly show that the amount of film drops produced by one bubble burst\ngreatly increases with the bubble size. For the smallest bubbles, under 4.6 mm in diameter, no\nfilm drop was detected. More precisely, the amount of film drops was so low that it could not\nbe detected, the difference in weight between the samples with- and without bubbling being\nbelow the balance sensitivity (10-5 g). The mass of film drops for 1 m3 of injected gas also\nincreases with the bubble size as long as this bubble size is lower than 11 mm. Above this\nsize, we can notice a plateau or a slight decrease in the amount of film drops. It would be\ninteresting to investigate further this phenomenon, as well as to relate the amount of film\ndrops to the mass of the bubble cap prior to bursting.\n4. Interpretation\nIn EAF, 60 % of dust come from projections of liquid metal and slag (see part I). These\nprojections from the bath can be attributed to the CO-bubble burst. The mechanisms involved\nin the formation of those projections in EAF can be slightly different from those met in our\nexperiment, particularly owing to the presence of a slag, either foaming or not. Nevertheless,\nthe results we have obtained give useful information for the understanding and the\nquantification of dust formation in EAF.\nJet drops come from the disintegration of the upward jet created after the removal of the\nbubble cap. Their number increases when the bubble size decreases, and their size represents\n12 to 18 % of the parent bubble size. The size of CO-bubbles formed in EAF remains little\nknown. However, analyses of foaming slag samples and numerical calculations indicate that\ntheir sizes are probably between 2 and 20 mm [8]. According to our results, such bubbles are\nexpected to produce jet drops whose sizes vary from 0.2 mm to almost 4 mm, which is much\nlarger than most of the particles found in EAF dust samples. As observed in our laboratory\nfurnace, jet drops are not exhausted by the fume extraction system and are likely to fall back\ninto the steel bath. Jet drops can thus hardly contribute to dust formation from bubble burst in\nEAF.\nFilm drops are emitted during the disintegration of the liquid cap which covers the bubble\nat the surface of the bath. Their morphology and their size range are very close to those of the\nparticles contained in EAF dust. The amount of projections produced by bubble burst in EAF\nvaries between 0.016 and 0.028 kg m-3 [8]. These figures are close to those derived from our\nlaboratory experiments (see table 1). Further associated with the conclusion of the jet drop\nsize study, they show that, when a bubble bursts, it is mostly the film drops that contribute to\ndust formation. Our results also reveal a significant decrease of the amount of film drops\nresulting from bubble burst when the bubble size decreases. Moreover we brought out the\n\n13\n\n\fPublished in Powder Technology, 2005, 157, 1-3, 2-11.\nexistence of a critical bubble size (around 4.5 mm) under which no film drop is detected.\nWhile this phenomenon was already evidenced by Spiel [14] for air-water systems, it had\nnever been observed in the case of liquid steel.\nFrom these results, it appears that it should be possible to reduce dramatically the amount\nof dust produced in EAF by decreasing the CO-bubble sizes, ideally between 1 and 4 mm.\nThe latter bound prevents the film drop formation and the former one avoids the emission of\njet drops small enough to be carried up. Such an objective may be difficult to reach since the\nCO-bubble formation is a rather spontaneous process. Nevertheless, a solution could be to\nbetter control the decarburization reaction, for example by favoring nucleation at the expense\nof growth.\nCONCLUSION\nFrom the study of the morphological and mineralogical characteristics of EAF dust samples\ncombined to the knowledge of the EAF steelmaking process, we could determine the\nmechanisms of EAF dust formation. Among the different sources of emission, the major one\nis the projection of liquid droplets by bubble burst at the liquid bath surface. We therefore\ndesigned an experimental device to observe the gas bubble burst at the surface of liquid steel\nby means of high-speed video, and to quantify the resulting projections by granulometric and\ngravimetric analyses. The phenomena involved are similar to those taking place in the case of\nan air bubble bursting at water surface and result in the emission of two types of droplets: film\ndrops and jet drops. Only film drops take part to the formation of EAF dust, jet drops are too\nbig to be exhausted and fall back into the liquid bath. We have also shown that the amount of\nfilm drops decreases with the size of the parent bubble. When the bubble size reaches 4.5 mm,\nno film drop is emitted. The bubble size is therefore a key parameter for the reduction of dust\nproduced in EAF.\nThe continuation of the present piece of work will consist in studying the influence of a\nslag at the surface of the bath, as well as that of surfactants, on the bubble-burst process.\n\nREFERENCES\n[1] A.M.
