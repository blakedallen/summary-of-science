Introduction\nStarting around 1989 there followed a period of intense activity in the field of (2+1)\u2013\ndimensional gravity, and a number of different approaches were developed. Some of these\nare the reduced phase space quantization with ADM variables [1, 2, 3], quantization of\nthe space of classical solutions of the first-order Chern-Simons theory [4, 5, 6], and\nquantization of the holonomy algebra [7].\nIn a pioneering article [1] Vincent Moncrief reduced (\u00e0 la ADM) the Einstein\nequations for pure 2+1 gravity (with or without a cosmological constant \u039b, and for\nspacetimes with compact Cauchy surface), to a time dependent, finite dimensional,\nHamiltonian system on the cotangent bundle of the Teichm\u00fcller space of the Cauchy\nsurface. At the same time Regge and I [7] were studying the first order, holonomy\nformalism of (2+1)\u2013dimensional gravity, following Witten [4] and Ach\u00facarro and\nTownsend [5]. In 1990 both Moncrief [8] and Carlip [6] started studying Cauchy surfaces\ndiffeomorphic to the torus, since although it is, in principle, possible to determine the\nevolution of the Teichm\u00fcller parameters and their conjugate momenta (i.e., the reduced\nADM variables), and therefore solve Hamilton's equations implicitly, this procedure can\nbe carried out in practice only for Cauchy surfaces diffeomorphic to the torus, since the\nspherical case is essentially trivial and the higher genus case particularly unyielding.\nAt about the same time Regge, Zertuche and I [9] were studying the case of non\u2013zero\ncosmological constant, and Carlip had determined [6] the relationship, for the case of\nthe torus T 2 , and with \u039b = 0, between the reduced ADM variables and the holonomy\nparameters, as a time\u2013dependent canonical transformation. Meanwhile Moncrief had\nfound [8] a set of six global constants of the motion, for the case of zero cosmological\nconstant, using a construction due to Martin [10]. Linear combinations of these global\nconstants satisfy the Lie algebra of the Poincar\u00e8 group ISO(1, 2). These constants were\nexactly the traces of the SO(1, 2) holonomies of the connections that Regge and I were\nstudying.\nA few years later Carlip and I [11] had extended the analysis of the relationship\n(both classical and quantum) between ADM variables and holonomy parameters, for the\ntorus T 2 , to \u039b 6= 0, and it was natural to apply this to Moncrief's global constants, since,\nalthough quantization in terms of the ADM variables was studied in [12], it involves\nnon\u2013trivial operator ordering ambiguities and the square root of the Laplace\u2013Beltrami\noperator [13].\nFirstly, Moncrief and I extended the construction of global constants to non\u2013zero\n(negative) cosmological constant. This was straightforward [14], and the six new global\nconstants were found to indeed reduce to those of [8] in the limit \u039b \u2192 0, and to satisfy\nthe Lie algebra of the anti\u2013de Sitter group SO(2, 2). Using the classical relationship\nfound in [11] the constants are particularly simple in terms of the holonomy parameters,\nand easily quantized [14].\nIn a related classical construction [15] for zero cosmological constant in the\nunreduced, ADM, Hamiltonian formalism it was shown that on inclusion of the globally\n\n\fGlobal constants in (2+1)\u2013dimensional gravity\n\n3\n\nconstant part of the Hamiltonian (the full ADM Hamiltonian is a function of time times\na global constant) three new global constants are derived and the algebra extends to that\nof the conformal algebra so(2, 3), whose corresponding group is the conformal group of\n3-dimensional Minkowski space. The same was true for \u039b 6= 0 and three new quantum\nconstants were obtained, which, together with the Hamiltonian, form a null SO(2, 2)\nvector [14].\nHere I show that there exactly no more global constants by expressing them in\nterms of two two\u2013component commuting constant spinors (whose components are the\nglobally constant holonomy parameters).\nThe plan of the paper is as follows. In section 2 the alternative classical and\nquantum descriptions, and the relationship between them, are discussed. In section\n3 six global constants are constructed, and expressed either in ADM variables, or\nthe holonomy parameters. Quantization is straightforward in terms of the holonomy\nparameters. In section 4 the extended algebra is calculated. In section 5 it is shown\nthat the set of constants is complete by explicit use of a spinor representation, and in\nsection 6 the role of the modular group is briefly discussed.\n2. Hamiltonian Dynamics\n2.1. Reduced ADM Dynamics\nIt is known [14, 11] that (2+1)-dimensional gravity, with topology R \u00d7 T 2 , the York\ntime coordinate condition, and with or without a cosmological constant \u039b, has (at least)\ntwo equivalent descriptions. In ADM quantization the reduced Einstein action can be\nwritten [1, 2]\nI1 =\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c4 p\n\n\u03b1 dq\u03b1\n\nd\u03c4\n\n!\n\n\u2212 H(q, p, \u03c4 ) ,\n\n\u03b1 = 1, 2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the constant mean curvature \u03c4 labels the slices T 2 , and q1 , q2 , p1 , p2 are the reduced\nADM canonical coordinates and momenta. In equation (1) the reduced, or effective,\nADM Hamiltonian H is just the spatial volume\nZ\nq\nq\n1\n(2)\nH\u0304,\nH\u0304 = p21 + e\u22122q1 p22 .\nH=\nd2 x (2) g = \u221a 2\nT2\n\u03c4 \u2212 4\u039b\nand is not constant, since volume is not conserved, but is, instead, a function of time\ntimes a global constant H\u0304. From (1) the basic Poisson brackets are\nn\n\no\n\n(3)\n\ni\n\n(4)\n\nqi , pj = \u03b4i j\n\nAs discussed in [12, 13] quantization is achieved by replacing equation (3) with the\ncommutators\nh\n\nq\u0302i , p\u0302j = ih\u0304\u03b4i j ,\n\nrepresenting the momenta as derivatives,\nh\u0304 \u2202\npj =\n,\ni \u2202qj\n\n(5)\n\n\fGlobal constants in (2+1)\u2013dimensional gravity\n\n4\n\nand imposing the Schr\u00f6dinger equation\n\u2202\u03c8(q, \u03c4 )\n= \u0124\u03c8(q, \u03c4 ),\n(6)\nih\u0304\n\u2202\u03c4\nwhere the Hamiltonian \u0124 is obtained from (2) by some suitable operator ordering. The\nobvious choice is that of equation (2), for which the Hamiltonian becomes\nh\u0304\n1/2\n\u0124 = \u221a 2\n\u22060 ,\n(7)\n\u03c4 \u2212 4\u039b\nwhere \u22060 is the ordinary scalar Laplacian for the constant negative curvature moduli\nspace. Other orderings would correspond to operators \u2206n , the weight n Maass\nLaplacians [16], which differ from \u22060 by terms of order h\u0304.\n2.2. The holonomy representation\nIn the fully reduced holonomy representation [7, 9] the constraints are solved exactly, the\nHamiltonian is zero, and (2+1)\u2013dimensional gravity is described, for the torus, by the\n\u00b1\nreal, global, time-independent traces R1\u00b1 , R2\u00b1 , R12\nof SL(2, R) holonomies which satisfy\nthe Poisson bracket algebra (cyclical in the three \u00b1 traces)\n1\n\u00b1\n\u2212 R1\u00b1 R2\u00b1 ).\n(8)\n{R1\u00b1 , R2\u00b1 } = \u2213 (R12\n4\u03b1\nIn equation (8) the two \u00b1 copies refer to the decomposition of the spinor group of\nSO(2, 2) (the anti-de Sitter group) as SL(2, R) \u2297 SL(2, R) [7], and the subscripts 1, 2\nrefer to two intersecting paths \u03b31 , \u03b32 on T 2 with intersection number +1. The third\n\u00b1\nholonomy, R12\ncorresponds to the path \u03b31 * \u03b32 , which has intersection number \u22121 with\n\u03b31 and +1 with \u03b32 , and the constant \u03b1 is related to the cosmological constant through\n\u039b = \u22121/\u03b12 . The holonomies of (8) can be parametrized as\u2217\nr1\u00b1\n2\n\u00b1\nr\nR2\u00b1 = cosh 2\n2\n\u00b1\nR12 = cosh (r1\u00b1 + r2\u00b1 )/2\nR1\u00b1 = cosh\n\n(9)\n\n\u00b1\nwhere r1,2\nare also real, global, time-independent (but undetermined) parameters which,\nfrom equation (8) satisfy\n1\n+\n\u2212\n{r1\u00b1 , r2\u00b1 } = \u2213 ,\n{r1,2\n, r1,2\n} = 0.\n(10)\n\u03b1\nWith this parametrisation, the Chern-Simons action [4, 5] is [11]\n\nI2 =\n\nZ\n\n\u03b1(r1\u2212 dr2\u2212 \u2212 r1+ dr2+ )\n\n(11)\n\nand quantization is achieved by replacing equations (10) with the commutators\n[r\u03021\u00b1 , r\u03022\u00b1 ] = \u2213ih\u0304/\u03b1,\n\n+\n\u2212\n[r\u03021,2\n, r\u03021,2\n] = 0.\n\n(12)\n\n\u2217 Direct quantization of the algebra (8) gives an algebra related to the Lie algebra of the quantum\ngroup SU(2)q [9, 17], where q = exp (4i\u03b8), tan \u03b8 = \u2212h\u0304/8\u03b1.

It should be noted, however, that no representation is known for the\nfundamental quantized holonomy parameters r1\u00b1 , r2\u00b1 which guarantees positivity of the\nreduced Hamiltonian (23), though some progress has been made using the representation\nof [18].\nComparing the two quantum theories is much more subtle, and I will say very little.\nThe ADM representation looks like a standard Schr\u00f6dinger picture quantum theory,\nwith time-dependent states \u03c8(q, \u03c4 ) whose evolution is determined by a Hamiltonian\noperator, equation (7). The holonomy representation resembles a Heisenberg picture\nquantum theory, characterized by time-independent states \u03c8(r1\u00b1 , r2\u00b1 ) (though clearly\nsome choice of polarization would be necessary) and time-dependent operators (20)\u2013\n(21). A polarization and unitary transformation between the two representations was\nconstructed in [18].\n3. Constants of the motion\nIt is known [10] that the traces of SO(1, 2) holonomies, for \u039b = 0, of connections\nintegrated along arbitrary closed loops, are absolutely conserved quantities (i.e., they\nare gauge invariant and invariant under non-singular deformations of the loops within\nthe vacuum spacetimes).\nHere for \u039b < 0 it is instead appropriate to use the integrated shifted connections\n(17) for SL(2, R) \u2297 SL(2, R), the spinor decomposition of SO(2, 2), the anti\u2013de Sitter\ngroup. As in [8] these traces were computed for 3-different classes of loops corresponding\nto the paths \u03b31 , \u03b32 and \"twisting loops\" \u03b31 * \u03b32 . In spatial coordinates x1 , x2 these loops\nwould correspond to having x2 = constant, x1 = constant, whereas the \"twisting loops\"\nx2 , for integer m, n, respectively. The twisting loops do not give new\nhave x1 = m\nn\nindependent conserved quantities but, instead, are functions of those coming from the\nloops \u03b31 and \u03b32 .\n3.1.

The Quantum Modular Group\nSo far I have not mentioned the role of the \"large diffeomorphisms\" - diffeomorphisms\nthat cannot be continuously deformed to the identity. For the torus T 2 this group-also\nknown as the modular group-acts on the torus modulus and momentum and holonomy\nparameters as\nS : m \u2192 \u2212m\u22121 ,\n\nT : m \u2192 m + 1,\n\n\u03c0 \u2192 m\u03042 \u03c0,\n\n\u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0,\n\nr1\u00b1 \u2192 r2\u00b1 ,\n\nr1\u00b1 \u2192 r1\u00b1 + r2\u00b1 ,\n\nr2\u00b1 \u2192 \u2212r1\u00b1 ,\n\nr2\u00b1 \u2192 r2\u00b1 ,\n\n(76)\n\nand generates the entire group of large diffeomorphisms of R \u00d7 T 2 . It can be seen from\nequation (76) that this group acts properly discontinuously on the ADM variables, (the\nconfiguration or Teichm\u00fcller space variables, see equation (21)) and in fact splits this\nspace into fundamental regions that are interchanged by the action of the group.\nBut on the holonomy parameters the group is not so well behaved. Even so, with\nthe ordering of equation (20) (the only ambiguity), the quantum action of the modular\ngroup is the same as the classical one, with no O(h\u0304) corrections, and is generated by the\nSO(2, 2) discrete anti\u2013de Sitter subgroup of the conformal group SO(2, 3) by conjugation\nwith the operators UT = UT+ UT\u2212 , and US = US+ US\u2212 [18, 19] where\ni\u03b1\ni\u03b1\ni\nUT\u00b1 = exp (j0\u00b1 + j1\u00b1 ) = exp \u2213 C2\u2213 = exp \u2213 (r2\u00b1 )2 ,\n2h\u0304\n2h\u0304\n2h\u0304\ni\u03c0\u03b1\ni\u03c0\u03b1 \u00b1 2\ni\u03c0\n(C1\u2213 + C2\u2213 ) = exp \u2213\n((r1 ) ) + (r2\u00b1 )2 ).(77)\nUS\u00b1 = exp j0\u00b1 = exp \u2213\n2h\u0304\n4h\u0304\n4h\u0304\n\n\fGlobal constants in (2+1)\u2013dimensional gravity\n\n13\n\nMoreover, it is easy to check that the commutators (12) and the ADM Hamiltonian\n(23) are invariant under the transformations (76). The initial constants \u0135a\u00b1 transform\ninto linear combinations of themselves, as do the group extensions v\u0302a , in such a way\nthat the quantum algebra (equation (36)) and the identities (equation (37)) are invariant\nunder the transformations (76).\n7. Conclusion\nIt is shown that there are exactly ten, and no more, global constants satisfying the Lie\nalgebra of so(2, 3), whose corresponding group is the conformal group of 3-dimensional\nMinkowski space. This is achieved by using two commuting two\u2013component constant\nspinors whose norms are their respective commutators. With the six central elements\n(equations (37), (42) and (43)) this leaves precisely four arbitrary global variables\ncorresponding to the required two degrees of freedom. These ten constants are easily\nexpressed and quantized in terms of the holonomy parameters.\nIt would be desirable to try to implement the operator analogues of C1 \u2212 C6 , or\nalternatively \u0135a\u00b1 on a partially reduced quantization, working on Teichm\u00fcller space for\nthe torus (i.e. the 2-dimensional hyperbolic space with global coordinates q 1 , q 2 and\n1\nRiemannian metric (dq 1 )2 + e2q (dq 2 )2 ) instead of moduli space, but unfortunately there\nis no known ordering of the operator analogues of expressions (25) which reproduces the\nso(2, 2) algebra as would be expected from classical considerations.\nIt would also be desirable to be able to express the three-vector v\u0302a (equation (40))\nin terms of the ADM variables. This is possible in principle, from its definition (39) but\n\u02c6 (equation (23)) require both the \u00b1 global parameters. But,\nunfortunately the v\u0302a and H\u0304\nas can be seen from equation (31) that would imply that the v\u0302a should be expressed as\n\u02c6\na square roots of quadratic combinations of the C1 \u2212 C6 . This is no surprise, since H\u0304\nis, from (2), or from (30) itself a square root of ADM variables, and is related to the v\u0302a\nthrough equation (43).\nFor completeness it should be noted that although only the case of negative\ncosmological constant was discussed there would seem to be no obstruction to the\ndiscussion for \u039b positive or zero (see the discussion in [11]). For example, for \u039b > 0,\nthe parameters r1\u00b1 , r2\u00b1 would be unchanged but the \"shifted connections\" (18), and in\nconsequence, the holonomies (9) and the corresponding de Sitter or sl(2,C) generators\nja \u00b1 , a = 0, 1, 2, equation (32) would be complex conjugates of each other rather than\nreal and independent as here, for \u039b < 0.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported in part by INFN Iniziativa Specifica FI41, and by the MIUR\nunder contract PRIN 2001-025492.\n\n\fGlobal constants in (2+1)\u2013dimensional gravity\n\n14\n\nReferences\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n\nMoncrief V 1989 J.
