[3, 4] Recent research has been directed towards\nbetter understanding of the current-driven excitation\nmechanism, adequate description of the magnetic dynamics, and optimization of magnetic devices e.g. to decrease\nthe switching current Is for possible applications in magnetic memory. [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,\n18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32]\nWe used the giant magnetoresistance effect (MR) to\nstudy current-driven switching in nanofabricated magnetic F1 /N/F2 trilayers (nanopillars). We studied how\nthe current-driven switching is affected by variations of\nthe magnetic field H, ambient temperature Tph , [25] coupling between magnetic layers, [24, 30] electron spinflipping in the spacer N or outside the trilayer, and mutual rotation of the two layers' magnetizations [31]. We\ninterpret our experimental results for currents that are\nnot too large in terms of the recently proposed effective\ntemperature model. [32]\nOur samples were made with a multistep process\ndescribed elsewhere. [24] Below, all thicknesses are in\nnm. The basic samples had structure Cu(80)/F1 (2030)/N(10-15)/F2(2-6)/Cu(2-5)/Au(150). F was either\nCo or Py=Ni84 Fe16 . Although Co is commonly used\nin studies of current-driven switching, Py has the advantage of small crystalline anisotropy and magnetostriction, allowing reproducible measurements at both 295 K\nand 4.2 K. The bottom Cu(80) layer was the extended\nlead, N, F2 and Cu(2-5) were patterned into an elongated\nshape with dimensions \u2248 (130 \u2212 140) \u00d7 (60 \u2212 70) nm2 ,\nand Au(150) was the top lead. In all the samples, except\nfor the AF-coupled ones (see Section. III), F1 was left extended to minimize the effect of dipolar coupling on the\ncurrent-driven switching. [11] Details of specific samples\nwill be given with their data. We measured dV /dI with\nfour-probes and lock-in detection, adding an ac current\nof amplitude 20\u201340 \u03bcA at 8 kHz to the dc current I. Positive current flows from F1 to F2 . H is in the film plane\nand (except for the angular dependence studies) along\nthe nanopillar easy axis.\n\nFIG. 1: (a) Switching with current at 295 K in an uncoupled\nPy/Cu/Py trilayer.

Downward triangles: AP\nto P switching, upward: P to AP switching, circles: switching\nof the extended Py(20) layer. The reversible switching peaks\nare marked by coinciding upward and downward triangles.\nFrom Urazhdin et al. [25]\n\nII.\n\nSWITCHING WITH VARIED H AND Tph\n\nFigs. 1(a,b) and insets show the variations of dV /dI\nwith I and H for a Py(20)/Cu(10)/Py(6) sample with\nuncoupled Py layers at 295 K (1a) and 4.2 K (1b), for\nH = 50 Oe (solid curves) and H = 500 Oe (dashed\ncurves). The dependencies are similar to those seen in\nCo/Cu/Co samples. [11, 24] At small H, the magnetization switches hysteretically to a higher resistance AP\nstate at a large enough positive current IsP \u2192AP \u2261 Is > 0,\nand to a low resistance P state at IsAP \u2192P < 0. At larger\nH, the switching step turns into a, often much higher,\nnonhysteretic peak. The asymmetric I-dependence is a\nsignature of the effect of the current on the magnetization, different from the Oersted field. Figs. 1(c,d) show\nthe switching diagrams at 295 K and 4.2 K, extracted\nfrom data such as those in Figs. 1(a),(b), obtained both\n\n\f2\n\nFIG. 2: Differential resistance of a Py(20)/Cu(10)/Py(3.5)\nuncoupled trilayer at the marked values of H, at 295 K (left)\nand 4.2 K (right). Curves are offset for clarity. Dashed lines\nfollow the reversible switching peak.\n\nby varying I at fixed H and H at fixed I. As expected,\nboth the reduced magnetization and thermal activation\nresult in smaller switching currents and fields Hs (I = 0)\nat 295 K. The only other major difference between the\n295 K and 4.2 K data in Figs. 1(a,c) is the rounding of\nthe 295 K hysteretic region at I < 0. In contrast, the\nhysteretic region at 4.2 K (Fig. 1(d)) is almost square.\nIn the reversible switching regime, both the 295 K and\n4.2 K current-dependencies in Fig. 1 show a nearly linear rise of dV /dI above a threshold current It (labeled in\nFigs. 1(a,b)). In some samples, this rise displays structures, clearly distinguishable from the switching peak due\nto their very weak dependence on H. Fig. 2 shows data\nfor a small Py(20)/Cu(10)/Py(3.5) sample, with dimensions estimated at 50 \u00d7 100 nm2 . At 4.2 K, the linear\nrise is resolved into several peaks. They appear only to\nthe left of the reversible switching peak, as the latter\nmoves to higher I with increasing H (shown by a dashed\nline). At 295 K, the peaks are replaced by a smeared nonmonotonic structure in dV /dI. Based on the data shown\nin Figs. 1 and 2, and 9 other similar Py/Cu/Py samples\nstudied, [25] we summarize the aspects of the threshold\nbehavior: i) It is close to the small-H value of IsP \u2192AP at\n4.2 K. The correspondence Is \u2248 It is not universal, e.g.\nin magnetically coupled samples the switching may occur\nat I < 0 (see Section III). ii) Both It and the sometimes\nobserved structures in dV /dI at I > It are only weakly\ndependent on H, as compared to the reversible switching peak. The 4.2 K data in Fig. 2 for H = 4 kOe\ngive It \u2248 1.0 mA, only 25% larger than It \u2248 0.8 mA\nat 250 Oe. iii) The height and inverse width of the reversible switching peak in dV /dI are correlated with the\nstructure in dV /dI at I > It : for example, in Fig. 2 (the\n295 K data), the reversible peak is tall and narrow when\nit is on the rising slope of the 'hump', but becomes wide\nand nearly disappears when on the trailing slope.\nWe discuss first the nature of the threshold behavior\nstarting at It , and then the reversible switching peak at\nhigher I. It has been identified as the onset of large\namplitude excitation of the patterned Py layer, as the\n\nmagnetic energy provided by the current exceeds the linear magnetic damping rate. [25] Starting at It , there\nis a strong increase of excitation amplitude, and the\nhighly excited magnetic state is manifested by increases\nin dV /dI, as illustrated in Figs. 1, 2. In all of our\nCo/Cu/Co samples, and most of our Py/Cu/Py samples,\nthe excitations result in a nearly linear increase in dV/dI\nabove It (see Fig. 1, and high H curves in Fig. 4(b)).\nIn contrast, in Py/Cu/Py samples with small lateral dimensions, at 4.2 K the excitations appear as a series of\npeaks in dV /dI above It (Fig. 2), corresponding to step\nincreases in resistance V /I, with details that vary from\nsample to sample. We attribute these peaks to irregularities in sample shapes, resulting in a complicated dependence on I of both the magnetic damping rates and\nthe distribution of excitations among different magnetic\nmodes. In larger samples, the shape irregularities are less\nsignificant, giving a smoother dV /dI.\nA different, quantum-mechanical origin has been proposed for the peaks, interpreted as the excitation threshold in point-contacts on magnetic multilayers. [3] This\nthreshold would be due to the requirement for matching\nof the current-driven spin-accumulation with the lowest energies of the magnetic excitations, \u2206\u03bc = h\u0304\u03c9. In\nnanopillars, the quantum threshold value would double\nwhen H is increased from 0 to \u2248 1 kOe. Such a rapid increase is inconsistent with our data. In addition, even at\n4.2 K, thermal smearing with kTph >> h\u0304\u03c9 \u2248 10 \u03bceV\nwould completely smear out the quantum threshold.\nThus, experiments rule out the quantum nature of the excitation threshold in nanopillars. We note that at large\nH > 2\u03c0M \u2248 5 kOe, both the classical and quantummechanical thresholds depend linearly on H, and h\u0304\u03c9 may\nbecome comparable to kT . In this limit, the quantum\nthreshold may become important.\nThe reversible switching peak in dV /dI is different from the threshold It and the peaks we associate\nwith magnetic excitations. Time resolved measurements\nshowed that it is a consequence of telegraph noise with\nrandom distribution of dwell times in the P and AP\nstates. [24, 25] Fig. 3(a) shows the variations of average dwell times \u03c4P (\u03c4AP ) in the P(AP) state with I for\na Py(20)/Cu(10)/Py(6) sample at 295 K and 4.2 K. \u03c4P\ndecreases as I increases, but \u03c4AP increases. These variations have a similar form at 295 K and 4.2 K, and are\nalso similar to the variations in Co/Cu/Co. [13] Fig. 3(b)\nshows that at a fixed I, \u03c4P increases and \u03c4AP decreases as\n|H| is increased (shown for 295 K). Fig. 3(c) shows that,\nwhen both I and H are increased so as to hold \u03c4P = \u03c4AP ,\nthe average period of the telegraph noise decreases exponentially with similar slopes at 295 K and 4.2 K, down\nto the 1 MHz bandwidth limit of our setup.\nWe now show how a peak in dV /dI at \u03c4P \u2248 \u03c4AP can\nbe derived from the variations of \u03c4P , \u03c4AP with I. For a\nfixed H, the average voltage across the sample is\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\nRAP \u03c4AP + RP \u03c4P\nV (I) = I\n,\n\u03c4P + \u03c4AP\n\n(1)\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 3:\n(a) The dependence of the P (downward triangles) and AP (upward triangles) dwell times on I, for\na Py(20)/Cu(10)/Py(6) uncoupled sample.

(1)\nRAP \u2212 RP\n+\n1 + exp[\u2212(\u03b1 + \u03b2)(I \u2212 I0 )]\nexp[(\u03b1 + \u03b2)(I \u2212 I0 )](\u03b1 + \u03b2)\n.\n\u2212 RP )\n(exp[(\u03b1 + \u03b2)(I \u2212 I0 )] + 1)2\n\nIII.\n\ndV /dI \u2248 RP +\nI(RAP\n\nand inverse width of the reversible switching peak are\ngiven by \u03b1 + \u03b2, which is usually dominated by \u03b1, i.e. the\ndependence of the magnetic excitation rate in the P state\non I. This is consistent with the correlation in Fig. 2(a)\nbetween the reversible switching peak and the 'bump'\nassociated with magnetic excitations: On the positive\nslope of the 'bump' (H = 150, 170 Oe), the excitation\nlevel grows faster with I than on its the trailing slope.\nConsequently, \u03b1 is larger on the rising slope of the bump,\ngiving a tall and narrow reversible switching peak. The\nreversible peak nearly disappears on the trailing slope at\nH = 190, 210 Oe, where \u03b1 is small.\nIn contrast to It , the switching peak does not represent an onset of a physical process, it merely reflects the\ncurrent-dependent telegraph noise statistics. The presence of telegraph noise near the reversible switching line\nindicates that both AP and P states are unstable there.\nStrictly, the stability diagrams, Figs. 1(c,d) should be\nmodified to include this unstable region. In most uncoupled samples, the P-state becomes unstable at I \u2248 It .\nThe instability of the P-state at I > It is thus indirectly\nmanifested in the rise of RP . The AP-state is unstable\nat I both below and above the reversible switching peak.\nSince \u03c4P is exponentially smaller than \u03c4AP , the measurements of dV /dI at I above the reversible switching peak\ngive values very near RAP .\nAs I and H are increased, \u03c4P , \u03c4AP quickly approach the\nintrinsic nanosecond switching timescale (see Fig. 3(c)),\nwhere telegraph noise is replaced by some sort of fast\nmagnetic dynamics. Such a transition does not give any\nsignificant changes in the switching peaks in dV /dI (see\ne.g. Fig. 2). Although the bandwidth limitation of our\nsetup does not allow us to directly probe this regime,\nspectroscopic measurements show continuous spectrum\nfrom 0 Hz up to \u2248 1 MHz, characteristic of incoherent\nmagnetic dynamics. [33] Microwave measurements show\npeaks at GHz frequencies on top of a broad background,\nevidence for some level of coherence. [28]\n\n(2)\n\nThe first two terms on the right are the resistance V /I,\ngiving a step for the reversible transition from P to AP.\nFor large I0 (\u03b1 + \u03b2), the last term has a maximum value\nI0 (RAP \u2212 RR )(\u03b1 + \u03b2)/4 at I \u2248 I0 . This term gives rise to\na peak in dV /dI at I = I0 that can be much higher than\nRAP . Fig. 3(d) shows a calculation (solid line) based on\nthe data of Fig. 3(a), and Eq. (2), for I0 = 6.45 mA, and\n\u03b1 + \u03b2 = 27 mA\u22121 extracted from fig. 3(a). The calculation is consistent with the dV /dI measurement (circles).\nWe conclude that the reversible switching peak positions\ncharacterize the points (H, I) where \u03c4P = \u03c4AP . The slope\nof the reversible switching line is a measure of the telegraph noise variation with I, H. From Eq. 2, the height\n\nEFFECTS OF MAGNETIC COUPLING\n\nFig. 4 summarizes the differences between uncoupled (left), AF-coupled (middle), and F-coupled (right)\nCo(20)/Cu(d)/Co(2.5) samples at 295 K. For uncoupled samples, we used d=10, and only patterned the\ntop Co(2.5) and most of the Cu(10) layer to nanopillar size, leaving the bottom Co(20)-layer extended. F\ncoupling was achieved by reducing the Cu thickness to\nCu(2.6), near the third RKKY magnetoresistance (MR)\nminimum. [36] Dipolar AF coupling was achieved by also\npatterning about 10 nm of the Co(20) layer, with d = 6.\nSample shape variations and interfacial roughness lead\nto variations in both AF and F coupling strengths.\nFig. 4(a)) shows field-driven switching in uncoupled\nsamples, similar to that in Fig. 1 for uncoupled Py-based\nsamples. In AF-coupled samples (Fig. 4(d)), the Co(2.5)\nlayer is oriented AP to the extended Co(20) layer by the\n\n\f4\n\nFIG. 5: Dependence of 1/IsP \u2192AP (upward triangles) and\n1/IsAP \u2192P (downward triangles) on \u2206R for uncoupled samples.

In contrast to Fig. 4(a), both the P\u2192AP\nand AP\u2192P transitions are now due to switching of the\nCo(2.5) layer. As H is scanned from a large negative to a\nlarge positive value, this layer switches three times: once\nto the AP state at negative H, then together with the\nCo(20) layer at small positive H to stay in the AP state,\nand finally to a P state at large positive H. The second\ntransition sometimes produces a weak feature in dV /dI.\nIn contrast, F-coupling causes the magnetizations to reverse simultaneously at small H, giving only a small feature in MR at I=0 (Fig. 4(h)). In H-scans at large enough\nfixed I > 0, F-coupled samples gave 5% MR, similar to\nthe I = 0 values for uncoupled or AF-coupled samples.\nFig. 4(b,e,i) compares the variations of dV /dI with I.\nAt small H = 20\u221250 Oe, applied to fix the magnetization\nof the bottom Co layer, the uncoupled sample (Fig. 4(b),\nsolid curve) shows hysteretic switching, while the AFcoupled (Fig. 4(e), top curve) and F-coupled (Fig. 4(i))\nones show reversible switching at I < 0 and I > 0, respectively. At larger H, the switching in uncoupled samples (Fig. 4(b), dashed curve) becomes reversible, and\nin AF-coupled samples (Fig. 4(e), lower two curves) it\nfirst becomes hysteretic and then reversible again. Time\nresolved measurements of resistance at I, H near the reversible switching peaks show telegraph noise switching\nbetween AP and P states (Fig. 4(c,f,g,j)). At identical I\nof opposite signs, the average telegraph noise periods in\nthe AF-coupled sample are similar.\n\nIV.\n\nRELATION BETWEEN MR AND Is\n\nWe\nstudied\nthe\ncorrelation\nbetween\nMR\nand Is in uncoupled samples with a structure\nCu(80)/Py(30)/N(15)/Py(6)/Cu(2)/Au(150).\nN=Cu\nin sample types 1 and 2.\nIn sample types 3\nand 4, N was Cu(9.5)/Cu94 Pt6 (4)/Cu(1.5) and\nCu(5.5)/Cu94 Pt6 (8)/Cu(1.5), respectively. The short\n295 K spin-diffusion length tsf \u2248 6 nm (\u2248 9 nm at\n4.2 K [35]) in Cu96 Pt6 decreases \u2206R \u2261 RAP \u2212 RP .\nWe enhanced \u2206R in sample type 2 by replacing Cu(2)\nwith a Cu(2)/Fe50 Mn50 (1)/Cu(2) sandwich. Fe50 Mn50\nis a strong spin-scatterer. [35] Its placement between\nthe trilayer and the top lead reduces the negative effect\nof the spin accumulation outside the trilayer on the\nMR. We also examined the variation of \u2206R and the\nswitching currents Is in samples of type 1 while rotating\nthe magnetization of the Py(30) with a small H in the\nfilm plane (similar results were shown in [26]).\nThe results, averaged over at least 7 samples of each\ntype, are summarized in Fig. 5, where data for angular\ndependence are also shown. Both IsAP and IsAP follow\nan approximately inversely linear dependence on \u2206R, regardless of the method by which \u2206R was varied.\n\nV.\n\nEFFECTIVE TEMPERATURE MODEL\n\nIn their pioneering work, Slonczweski [1] and\nBerger, [2] predicted that exchange interaction leads\nto current-driven magnetic excitation by spin-polarized\ncurrent. Berger considered generation of magnons by\nspin-flipping of electrons, driven by the spin accumulation. Slonczewski considered the electron spin component transverse to the magnetization, which is absorbed by the ferromagnet due to a combination of spindependent reflection at the interfaces and averaging of\nthe spin precession phases in the ferromagnet. The re-\n\n\f5\nsulting torque drives the magnetic dynamics. This model\npostulates conservation of the total magnetic moment,\nand thus captures only the coherent (uniform) magnetic\ndynamics. It can not consistently treat the excitation\nof finite-wavelength spin-waves, whose generation is generally not associated with transfer of angular momentum transverse to the magnetization (a similar argument\nis used to prove that only uniform precession is excited\nin the transverse FMR experiments). Similarly, Berger\nmade the approximation that only the uniform precession is generated by electron spin-flipping, leading again\nto coherent magnetic dynamics.\nSince the characteristic magnon energies are significantly lower than the typical conduction electron energies (see the above discussion of the lack of quantum\nthreshold behavior), we assume that a large number of\nmagnetic modes are excited by the current. The populations ni of the modes with energies Ei can be then approximately described by a single parameter, an effective\ntemperature Tm , so that ni \u2248 kB Tm /Ei for the degenerate modes. [24, 25, 32] This approximation fails when\nTm approaches the Curie temperature of the ferromagnet. We emphasize that this is just a single-parameter\napproximation for a generally much more complex, nonthermalized excitation distribution. Because of the large\nmagnon populations, the spontaneous (independent of\nni ) magnon emission can be neglected. In a ballistic\ntransport approximation [32]\nkTm \u2248\n\nkTph\n,\n1 + 2peV B/\u03b3\n\n(3)\n\nwhere B is a constant characterizing the strength of the\nexchange interaction, \u03b3 is related to the Gilbert damping\nparameter in the classical Landau-Lifshitz equation, V\nis the voltage across the trilayer, and p is the current\npolarization, created at the location of F2 by F1 , if F2 is\nremoved. p > 0(< 0) in the P(AP) state for Py/Cu/Py or\nCo/Cu/Co trilayers, and p = 0 if F1 is removed. Eq. 3 is\nsimilar to the expression obtained by Berger in a diffusive\ntransport approximation (Eq. (9) in Ref. [6]).\nEq. (3) diverges at V \u2192 \u2212\u03b3/(2peB). We identify this\ndivergence with the threshold It for the large amplitude\nof excitations. Eq. (3) is not applicable above the threshold, because the conduction electrons are scattered with\na large spin-flip probability (\u2248 0.5), nearly independent\nof Tm . For this regime, we have proposed an empirical\nrelation [25]\nTm = Tph + K(I \u2212 It ) for I > It ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere K is a constant determined by the magnetic relaxation rate. In the thermal activation model, the dwell\ntimes \u03c4P,AP are determined by\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\nUP,AP\n\u03c4P,AP = exp\n,\n(5)\nP,AP\n\u03a9\nkTm\nwhere \u03a9 \u2248 107 s\u22121 [34] is the effective attempt rate,\nUP,AP is the potential barrier for switching from the P or\n\nFIG. 6: Schematics of current-driven switching, as explained\nin the text. Dashed lines indicate Tm .\n\nAP state. Tm is approximated by Eq. (3) for the low-H\nhysteretic switching, or Eq. (4) for the telegraph noise.\nThe areas of the P(AP) state stability are determined\nby \u03c4P (AP ) > 1 s. UP,AP depend on I only through the\nvariation of the magnetization with Tm .\nFig. 6(a) schematically describes hysteretic currentdriven switching in uncoupled samples at small H. From\nP\nEq. (3), Tm\ndrastically increases when I approaches It ,\ngiving rise to a thermally activated transition into the\nUP\nP\nP\nAP state at kTm\n\u2248 ln(tUexp\n\u03a9) \u2248 16 , for the data acquisition time texp = 1 sec/point. In the AP state,\nEq. (3) predicts that the magnetic system weakly cools\nAP\nto Tm\n< Tph , so that at H < Hs it becomes trapped\nin this state. Fig. 6(b) is a schematic for H > Hs , givAP\ning kTph > U16\n. The AP to P switching is now thermally activated, resulting in telegraph noise at I > Is ,\nH > Hs . Fig. 6(c) is the schematic for AF-coupled samples at small H. AF coupling increases UAP and reduces\nUP , so that P to AP switching is now thermally activated. At large enough I < 0, reverse switching also\nbecomes thermally activated, giving telegraph noise. As\nH grows, the schematic for AF-coupling becomes 6(a),\ngiving hysteretic switching, and then 6(b), giving telegraph noise for large enough positive I. Finally, 6(b) is\nthe schematic for F-coupling at all H, so that AP to P\nswitching is always thermally activated and large enough\nI > 0 gives telegraph noise.\nThe difference between the 295 K and 4.2 K switching\ndiagrams (Fig. 1) is qualitatively well described by the\neffective temperature model. [32] The rounding of the\n295 K diagram at I < 0 is due to enhancement of thermal fluctuations of magnetization even at small I (see\nEq. 3). Increasing H decreases UAP , so that even these\nweak excitations can activate the AP\u2192P transition. In\ncontrast, the almost square 4.2 K diagram reflects the\nsmall excitation amplitude at I < It , beyond which the\nexcitation rapidly grows, giving the switching.\nWe use Eqs. (4) and (5) to describe the dependencies of \u03c4P on I, H, and Tph in Fig. 3. Eq. (3) should\nbe used for \u03c4AP (I, H, Tph ). These equations capture the\ntendencies qualitatively well. From the slope of \u03c4P (I),\nP\nthe increase rate of TM\nin Py(20)/Cu(10)/Py(6) samples\nis estimated at \u2248 400 K/mA. [25] The thermal activation\nmodel breaks down when kB Tm becomes similar to UP .\nThis limitation of the model should be understood in the\ncontext of the actual magnetic dynamics. Tm \u2248 U in\nEq. 5 gives a switching rate similar to the intrinsic magnetic dynamic rates. Telegraph noise switching is then\nreplaced with fast fluctuations of the magnetic moment.\n\n\f6\nThe effective temperature concept (defined for a given\nmagnetic orientation) becomes irrelevant in this regime.\nWe note that, although the 295 K and 4.2 K currentdependencies in Fig. 3(a) are given for different values\nof H, the effect of this difference on \u03c4P should be small,\nas can be seen from Fig. 3(b). Since UP is large, its\nrelative variation with H is small, compared to much\nlarger relative variation of UAP . Thus, Fig. 3(a) can be\nused to determine \u03c4P (I), while \u03c4AP is adjusted with H.\nFinally, to describe the inverse relationship in Fig. 5,\nwe use the simplest plausible model, in which \u2206R is proportional to the current polarization p at the location of\nF2 due to F1 . This crude approach is self-consistent: the\nMR is correctly predicted to disappear if F1 is absent.\nThe current-driven switching occurs at 16kB Tm \u2248 U .\nFrom Eq. 3 follows 1/Is \u221d p, giving the dependence in\nFig. 5. In this context, the angular dependence can be\nunderstood similarly in terms of the projection of p onto\nthe direction of the magnetization of F2 .\nVI.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nWe summarize the following important experimental observations for current effects in magnetic trilayer\n\n[1] J.
