Based on a careful analysis of the radio jets of 38 radio sources,\nLaing et al. (1999) inferred that the bulk flow of\na typical FR 1 jet decelerates from a relativistic\nspeed to less than \u223c 0.1c within a distance of two\nto tens of kpc from the nucleus. The inferred deceleration agrees with the expectations of a model\nin which the jet entrains material from its surroundings (Bicknell 1994; Laing 1996).

Chiaberge et al. (2000)\ncame to the same conclusion based on a comparison of BL Lac and FR I core spectral energy\ndistributions. Some jet launching models include\nan ultra-fast spine produced by the ergosphere of\na rotating black hole, with the slower sheath emanating from the accretion disk (e.g., Punsly 1996;\nMcKinney 2006). Alternatively, Meier (2003) proposed that the spine is generated by the central\nengine, while the sheath arises from velocity shear\ndownstream.\nThe proposed deceleration of jets could rec-\n\n\foncile gross discrepancies between inferred bulk\nas is the case for some quasars (Dermer & Atoyan\nLorentz factors \u0393 of the BL Lac and FR I popula2004).

The resulting\nimage (Fig. 1) shows a prominent jet that extends\nout to \u223c 20\u2032\u2032 from the nucleus. The direction of\nthe jet changes by 55\u25e6 from the straight inner section within 8\u2032\u2032 of the core to the end of the X-ray\nemission. The jet has a knotty structure, which\nwe separate into five regions, J1 \u2212 J5. All knots\nare detected at a level of 10\u03c3 or higher relative to\nthe background.\nWe fit the spectral data for the jet in the photon energy range 0.2-6 keV by a power-law model\nwith fixed Galactic absorption NH = 3.02 \u00d7 1020\ncm\u22122 (Dickey & Lockman 1990). (Allowing the\ncolumn density to vary yields a value that is not\nsignificantly different from this.) The calculated\nparameters of the X-ray jet are given in Table 2.\n2.2.\n\nJ4. However, the fluxes are at 1-2\u03c3 detection\nlevel owing to possible confusion with unrelated\nIR sources, hence we cannot ascertain that the\nemission is physically associated with the jet. We\ntherefore use the measured fluxes (plus the 2-\u03c3 uncertainties) to estimate the IR upper limits for the\njet regions.\n2.4.\n\nWe processed the VLA data with the Astronomical Image Processing System (AIPS) software\nprovided by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO), following the standard procedures outlined in the AIPS Cookbook available at\nwww.nrao.edu. (The observations at 15 GHz included only 15 of the usual 27 antennas, since\nthey occurred during the changeover to the new\nEVLA.) Each observation employed two 50 MHz\nbands, centered on 1.3851, 1.4649 GHz (21 cm\nwavelength), 4.5351, 4.8851 GHz (6 cm), and\n14.915, 14.965 GHz (2 cm), with mean frequencies listed in Table 1. We performed the imaging\nwith the Difmap software (Shepherd 1997), again\nfollowing standard procedures. Figure 4 presents\nall three radio images, while Table 2 gives the parameters of the radio emission. The image at 1.425\nGHz is very similar to the full-resolution version\npresented by Perlman & Stocke (1994), which was\nbased on the same data.\n\nOptical Observations\n\nOver two orbits of HST, we obtained 12 exposures of 230 sec each of OJ287 with the WFPC2\nPC-chip using the broad filter F606W in a 4-point\ndithering mode. The images were combined with\ntask crrej within the STSDAS software package.\nWe generated the point-spread function (PSF)\nwith the TinyTim software and subtracted it from\nthe combined image. The deconvolved image is\ndisplayed in Figure 2. We did not detect significant flux over the sky level along the position of\nthe X-ray and radio jet. Yanny, Jannuzi, & Impey\n(1997) also did not detect the jet at 814 nm with\nthe WFPC2, and found that emission from nebulosity associated with the host galaxy is insignificant beyond 4\u2032\u2032 from the nucleus.\n2.3.\n\nRadio Observations\n\n3.\n\nObservational Results\n\nFigure 5 displays the entire jet at both radio\nand X-ray frequencies. The radio and X-ray emission is generally coincident within 12\u2032\u2032 of the nucleus, beyond which the radio emission falls below\nthe detection limit. An exception is knot J3, situated along the southern rim of the jet with centroid 7\u2032\u2032.5 from the nucleus, where we detect no\nradio emission above the noise level. Because of\nthe low radio flux, we cannot reliably determine\nthe flux density separately at 4.7 or 14.9 GHz for\neach knot denoted in Figure 1. We therefore measure these quantities only for the entire extended\njet from knot J1 to J5, with the values given in\nTable 2.\n\nInfrared Observations\n\nWe observed OJ287 with IRAC on SST at 3.6\nand 5.8 \u03bcm with a single frame exposure of\n12 s in a dithering mode (36 Positions Reuleaux).\nWe used the Level 2 Post-BCD Pipeline images,\nwhich we checked for artifacts. We created the\nPSF at each infrared (IR) wavelength using image stars, then subtracted it from the image with\nthe task apex qa 1frame.pl of version 18.3.1 of the\nMOPEX/APEX software package.

In Figure 7 we\nplot both the X-ray and radio intensity profiles\nalong the jet axis, and only the transverse X-ray\nprofile along the crosscuts. The path along the\naxis misses knot J3, which lies along the southern boundary of the jet, but crosscut b includes\nthe knot. Knots J1, J2, and J4 are clearly seen in\nthe axial profile, while crosscut a passes through\nknot J2 and c includes J4. The maximum X-ray\nintensity lies farther from the nucleus than does\nthe radio peak in both J1 and J2 by 0\u2032\u2032.9 and 0\u2032\u2032.5,\nrespectively, while the peaks at the two wavebands\ncoincide in knot J4. In each case, however, the upstream boundaries of the radio and X-ray emission\ncoincide.\nThe displacement of the intensity peaks of\nknots J2-J4 from the axis (defined as the centroid\nof the detectable X-ray emission across the jet)\nseen in Figures 1 and 7 is striking. On the other\nhand, the intensity along the axis is too strong to\nconsider the jet to be edge-brightened.\nThe spectral index of the radio emission from\nthe jet, integrated over the region containing detectable X-ray flux, is \u03b1(radio)= 0.8 \u00b1 0.1. This\ndiffers somewhat from the X-ray value, \u03b1(X-ray)=\n0.61\u00b10.06. The discrepancy could be due to a gradient in X-ray spectral index, which increases with\ndistance from the nucleus from knots J2 to J4.\nWe note that the overall radio spectral index falls\nwithin the 1-\u03c3 range of the X-ray spectral index\nfor all knots except J2. Given this, and because\nwe can only determine the overall radio spectral\nindex, we will ignore the small apparent radio/Xray discrepancy in spectral slope and adopt a value\n\u03b1 = 0.7 in our analysis.\nThe radio emission on milliarcsecond scales consists of a bright \"core\" with multiple knots -\nsome with apparent superluminal motion and others that are subluminal or even stationary -\nlined up along position angles that vary with\ntime. These cover a range over more than 90\u25e6\n(Tateyama & Kingham 2004; Agudo et al. 2010),\nwhich is amplified by projection effects owing to\nthe small angle of the compact jet to the line\n\n3.2.\n\nUpper Limit to Unbeamed Radio Luminosity\n\nThe parsec-scale superluminal motion, with apparent velocities as high as 18c (Jorstad et al.\n2005), indicates that bulk motions in the jet are\nhighly relativistic inside the nucleus. Jorstad et al.\n(2005) combined the apparent speeds with the\nrate of decline of flux of moving knots to derive\na Doppler factor \u03b4 = 18.9 \u00b1 6.4, a bulk Lorentz\nfactor \u0393 = 16.5 \u00b1 4.0, and an angle between the\naxis and line of sight of 3\u25e6.2 \u00b1 0\u25e6.9 for the compact\njet. The one-sidedness of the extended X-ray and\nradio emission implies that relativistic bulk motion continues at least out to an angular distance\nof 20\u2032\u2032 from the nucleus.\nWe cannot determine whether any of the radio\nemission that we detect is unbeamed. However,\ngiven the limit to the sensitivity of our radio images, it is possible that the two outermost features\nseen in Figure 5 are located in a very faint lobe\nor other region where there is only non-relativistic\nbulk flow. We measure a flux density at 1.425 GHz\nfrom this region to be 4.6 \u00b1 0.9 mJy, which gives\na 2-\u03c3 upper limit to the unbeamed extended radio\npower at 1.4 GHz of < 2\u00d71024 W Hz\u22121 . We therefore confirm that this BL Lac object is within the\nluminosity range expected for FR 1 radio sources\n(Fanaroff & Riley 1974).\n3.3.\n\nSpectral Energy Distribution\n\nFigure 8 presents the multifrequency continuum\nspectrum of the extended jet. The measurements\ninclude the entire length of the detected extended\nX-ray jet, i.e., from 3\u2032\u2032 to 20\u2032\u2032 from the nucleus\nin order to provide a signal-to-noise ratio at 4.7\nand 14.9 GHz sufficiently high for analysis and to\nallow comparison with the low-resolution IR images. The figure reveals that the X-ray emission\n\n4\n\n\flies slightly above an extrapolation of the radio\nspectrum, while the 3.6 \u03bcm IR and 600 nm optical upper limits fall well below the extrapolation.\nIn fact, the 600 nm upper limit is comparable to\nthe X-ray flux measurement. This is contrary to\nmodels in which the X-rays arise from synchrotron\nradiation from electrons with energies in the TeV\nrange. In such models (Dermer & Atoyan 2002,\n2004; Jester et al. 2006; Uchiyama et al. 2006),\nthe value of \u03bdF\u03bd (X-ray) can exceed \u03bdF\u03bd (opt), but\nthe flux densities cannot unless the electron energy\nspectrum is extraordinarily shallow, N (\u03b3) \u221d \u03b3 \u2212s\nwith s \u2248 1, where \u03b3 is the electron energy in units\nof me c2 . In this case, essentially all of the electron\nenergy would be confined to TeV energies. Furthermore, the spectral index in the X-ray region\nshould then be \u03b1(X \u2212 ray) \u223c 0, while our measured value is significantly higher.\nHaving eliminated the synchrotron model, we\nconstruct the SED for the alternative model,\nIC/CMB, by integrating over both the electron\nenergy distribution [assumed to be of the form\nN (\u03b3) = N0 \u03b3 \u2212(2\u03b1+1) ] and the spectrum of the\nCMB to calculate the X-ray flux density as a\nfunction of photon energy. In order to avoid violating the upper limit at 600 nm, we cut off the\nelectron energy distribution below an energy \u03b3min .\nWe present two SEDs for this model in Figure 8,\nrepresenting the lowest and highest allowed values\nof the product \u03b4\u03b3min that provide good fits to the\nobserved SED.\n4.\n4.1.\n\nfor the value that is most consistent with the data\nat both wavebands, \u03b1 = 0.7.\nThe above values of a and \u03b1, plus the flux densities listed in Table 2 yield a Doppler factor \u03b4 = 8.7\nand magnetic field B = 5.4 \u03bcG for the case \u03b3min =\n7 that represents the leftmost curve in Figure 8,\nwhile for the rightmost curve \u03b4 = 7.9, B = 4.9 \u03bcG,\nand \u03b3min = 40. In order to derive the minimum\ntotal jet power, we assume equipartition between\nthe magnetic and electron energy densities. We\nthen multiply the magnetic energy density B 2 /8\u03c0\nby 4\u03c0 times the square of the luminosity distance,\nthe cross-sectional area \u03c0(a/2)2 and speed (\u2248 c) of\nthe jet, and the square of the bulk Lorentz factor\n(with the approximation that \u0393 \u2248 \u03b4) to transform\nto the host galaxy rest frame. We double the result, since the magnetic field supplies only half of\nthe total energy under the equipartition assumption, to arrive at a total power of 1-2\u00d71045 ergs\ns\u22121 . This is similar to that derived from a detailed analysis of very long baseline interferometric\nimages for the parsec-scale jet of the FR 1 radio\ngalaxy 3C 120 by Marscher et al. (2007). Both\nanalyses, however, ignore the rest mass of the protons, which multiplies the derived kinetic power by\n\u22121\n\u223c 1800f \u03b3min\n, where f is the fraction of the positively charged species that are protons rather than\npositrons. The total kinetic power is therefore\n\u223c 1\u00d71045(1+50f ) ergs s\u22121 for the value \u03b3min = 40\nthat minimizes the power requirement. This cor\u22121\nresponds to \u223c 3MBH,8\ntimes the Eddington luminosity of a black hole with mass 1\u00d7108MBH,8 M\u2299 .\nIf the mass of the black hole that powers OJ287 is\nas high as 1.8 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 , as in the binary model\nof Valtonen et al. (2008), then the total kinetic\npower is much less than the Eddington value. The\njet power can be sub-Eddington even if the blackhole mass is \u223c 109 M\u2299 . We therefore find that the\nEC/CMB model for the X-ray emission produces\nreasonable physical parameters, especially if the\nvalue of \u03b3min near the maximum of \u223c 40 allowed\nby the SED.\n\nDiscussion\nPhysical Parameters of the Extended\nJet\n\nWe use the formulas derived in the Appendix of\nJorstad & Marscher (2004) to determine the physical parameters of the extended jet of OJ287 under\nthe assumptions that the X-ray emission is from\nthe IC/CMB process and that the magnetic and\nparticle energy densities are equal, with random\nkinetic energies of the protons and electrons each\ncontributing 25% of the total energy density. We\ndo this for knot J4, 8\u2032\u2032 from the nucleus, which is\nwell resolved from the other features in both the\nX-ray and radio images. The knot is nearly circular (see Fig. 1), with a mean extent of a = 1\u2032\u2032.4.\nWe assume that the radio and X-ray spectral indices are the same, and carry out the calculations\n\n4.2.\n\nBending, Length, and Deceleration of\nthe Jet\n\nWe note that the derived value of the Doppler\nfactor in knot it J4 8\u2032\u2032 from the nucleus is a factor\nof 2-3 lower than that found in the parsec-scale\njet (Jorstad et al. 2005). This implies that the\njet flow either decelerates on scales of hundreds\n5\n\n\fof kiloparsecs or varies over time-scales of thousands of years. The main bending of the jet appears to occur beyond 8\u2032\u2032 from the nucleus. If the\njet remains as straight in three dimensions as it\nappears projected on the sky, as is the most likely\ncase, then we can adopt the same value for the angle of the axis to the line of sight as that found on\nparsec scales, \u03b8 = 3.\u25e6 2 \u00b1 0.\u25e6 9 (Jorstad et al. 2005).\nThe deprojected length of the straight portion of\nthe jet is then 640+940\n\u2212140 kpc. In order for a jet at\nan initially small viewing angle to appear to bend\nby more than that angle, it must curve in three\ndimensions by at least the same angle as \u03b8. Such\nbending should require a shock at the boundary\nof the jet opposite the side toward which it curves\n(Courant & Friedrichs 1948). Knot J3 could represent such a shock. If the total curvature of the\njet in three dimensions is near the minimum required to produce the apparent bending by 55\u25e6 ,\n\u2206\u03b8 & 3\u25e6.2, then the final viewing angle increases\nto \u223c 7\u25e6 . With these values, we estimate the total\ndeprojected length of the X-ray jet to be & 1 Mpc,\nwith the radio jet extending even farther.\nThe Doppler factor that we have obtained from\nour analysis is still quite high, indicating that the\njet flow remains highly relativistic out to hundreds\nof kiloparsecs from the nucleus. This is contrary\nto the deceleration to sub-relativistic speeds and\ndisruption on scales of tens of kiloparsecs that has\nbeen inferred to be typical of FR 1 radio galaxies\n(Laing 1996; Laing et al. 1999). However, OJ287\ncannot be typical, given the highly relativistic nature of the jet on parsec scales, with \u0393 = 16.5\u00b14.0,\ncompared with a more common value closer to\n\u0393 \u223c 1 (see Lister & Marscher 1997). The extension of the jet beyond 1 Mpc therefore agrees\nwith the theoretical expectation (see \u00a71) that more\nhighly relativistic (and presumably more highly\nsupersonic) flows can penetrate the interstellar\nand intergalactic medium out to greater distances\nbefore being slowed down and disrupted.\n4.3.\n\nstructure has been used as an argument against\nthe IC/CMB model on the grounds that the energies of the electrons that scatter the CMB photons\nto the X-ray range are low, \u03b3 \u223c 40-130 in the case\nof OJ287. Because of this, the electrons have lifetimes to radiative energy losses that are too long\nto confine the emission to knots of length 5-10 kpc\n(Stawarz et al. 2004). This is true even for electrons radiating at centimeter wavelengths, whose\nLorentz factors are quite high, \u03b3 \u223c 104 for magnetic fields in the several micro-Gauss range. The\nradiative-loss lifetimes (mainly from IC/CMB radiation) of these electrons are & 106 yr. While gradients in magnetic field can cause synchrotron intensity contrasts, the knot to inter-knot flux ratio\nis too high for this to be the sole cause. The knotty\nstructure must therefore involve another process.\nWe now consider hydrodynamical effects that can\npotentially produce emission features with sizes\n. 10 kpc.\n4.3.1.\n\nStanding Shock Model\n\nHydrodynamical effects that occur in the flows\nof jets (Courant & Friedrichs 1948) can cause spatial variations in both density and bulk velocity. Interactions with the external medium form\nshocks oblique to the jet axis that decelerate, compress, and bend the jet flow (G\u00f3mez et al. 1997),\nas well as energize relativistic particles. In between the shocks are rarefactions, which increase\nthe Lorentz factor \u0393 at the expense of lower energy density ue \u221d ne \u03b3min of the electrons, where\nne is the number density of electrons. On the\nother hand the energy density of relativistic electrons is inversely related to \u0393; e.g., in the case\nof adiabatic compression and rarefactions and an\n\u22121/4\nultra-relativistic equation of state, \u0393 \u221d ue\n\u221d\n(1\u22122\u03b1) \u22121/4\n. Because the IC/CMB intensity\n[N0 \u03b3min ]\ndepends on these factors as IIC/CMB \u221d N0 \u03b4 2 \u03932 \u223c\n\u22121/4\nN0 \u03934 for a small viewing angle, the \u0393 \u221d N0\nrelationship would limit the knot to inter-knot intensity ratio to a value near unity if compression\nwere the only physical effect. We therefore need\nto include non-adiabatic effects of shocks to explain the presence of distinct knots of IC/CMB\nemission.\nWe use the formulas given in Lind & Blandford\n(1985) and Cawthorne & Cobb (1990) to calculate \u0393 and the angle of deflection \u03be of the flow\n\nKnotty Structure of the Jet and\nShock Models\n\nThe bulk of the extended X-ray emission seen in\nFigure 1 emanates from several bright knots. Figure 7 shows that the knot to inter-knot flux ratio is\nas high as \u223c 10:1 in X-rays and even greater at 4.7\nGHz. A successful emission model must be consistent with this morphology. In fact, such knotty\n6\n\n\fvelocity behind the shock, as well as the ratio of\npost-shock to pre-shock densities. These depend\non the upstream value of \u0393 and the angle of inclination \u03b7 of the shock front relative to the upstream flow direction. We consider the most extreme case, in which \u0393up = 16.5, as derived on\nparsec scales, is adopted for the upstream flow\nand \u0393down \u2248 8 downstream of the shock front,\nas in knot J4. This occurs for \u03b7 = 7\u25e6 and causes\na deflection \u03be = 4\u25e6 that is adequate for a large\nbend to appear in projection, as observed. We\nnote that, since it is the velocity component that\nis transverse to the shock front that decreases,\nthe shock must be oriented in the direction of\nthe bend, which can be seen to be the case for\nknot J3 in Figure 1. We calculate the upstream\nto downstream density contrast to be a factor of 5\nin this model. If we include compressional heating\n1/3\nby the shock, so that \u03b3min \u221d ne , we find that\n(3+2\u03b1)/3\n2\u03b1\nN0 \u221d ne \u03b3min \u221d ne\nincreases by a factor\nof 11 from the compression for our adopted value\n\u03b1 = 0.7. However, the decrease in \u0393 across the\nshock offsets this when calculating the expected\nIC/CMB intensity, since IIC/CMB \u221d N0 \u03934 . In order to explain the intensity contrast, the shock\nwould need to heat the electrons more strongly\nby another process, probably diffusive particle\nacceleration (e.g., Ellison, Baring, & Jones 1996;\nMeli & Quenby 2003). In order to bring the knot\nto inter-knot intensity ratio to the observed value\nof \u223c 10 by increasing N0 , the minimum (and therefore the mean) relativistic electron energy would\nneed to increase by a factor of \u223c 16, i.e., 8 times\nmore than by compression alone. The required increase in \u03b3min could be reduced by a factor of 1.6 if\n\u0393up were 10 (roughly the minimum Lorentz factor\nthat is compatible with a shock having \u0393down = 8)\ninstead of the parsec-scale value of 16.5.\nSince bending and deceleration of the jet near\nthe X-ray knots can be caused by interactions with\nthe external medium that set up standing oblique\nshocks that deflect the flow, a shock model can potentially explain both features of the jet in OJ287.\nThis conclusion is supported by the crude 1.425\nGHz polarization map displayed in Figure 9. (Unfortunately, the noise level of the polarized intensity is too high even to estimate the position angle of the polarization after statistical bias is taken\ninto account.) The highest polarization is between\nknot J3 and the southeastern side of J4, where the\n\njet first bends noticeably, as well as in J5. The\npolarization is \u223c 10% in Knot J2. This conforms\nwith the expectation for a shock, which partially\naligns a chaotic ambient magnetic field along the\ndirection of the shock front.\n4.3.2.\n\nMoving Shock Model\n\nMoving shocks, caused by major disturbances\nin the injection at the central engine, are a viable alternative to stationary ones, since the electron energies and densities, as well as the bulk\nLorentz factor, all increase behind the shock front\nrelative to those of the undisturbed flow. Such\nshocks are bounded by rarefactions on the side toward the nucleus, since the shocked flow is faster\nthan the undisturbed flow that was later injected\ninto the jet. We note that this scenario is in\nfact similar to the intermittent jet proposal by\nStawarz et al. (2004), since it involves a major enhancement in the jet flow velocity and/or injected\nenergy density that persists for thousands of years.\nAlthough the direction of elongation of the knots\nseen in Figure 1 is not always transverse to the\nflow, we will simplify by approximating that the\nshock front is perpendicular to the velocity vector. In the rest frame of the shock front, marked\nby a prime, the ratio of density ahead of (subscript \"2\") to that behind (\"1\") the front equals\nn2 /n1 = (\u0393\u20321 \u03b21\u2032 )/(\u0393\u20322 \u03b22\u2032 ), where \u03b2 is the velocity in\nlight units (e.g., Sokolov, Marscher, & McHardy\n2004). We can obtain a consistent solution if,\nin the (unprimed) rest frame of the host galaxy\nof OJ287, \u03931 = 5 for the pre-shocked ambient\njet and \u0393s = 11 for the shock front. Relativistic addition of the velocities gives \u03932 = 7.9 for\nthe shocked plasma if \u03b22\u2032 = 1/3, as appropriate\nfor an ultra-relativistic equation of state (K\u00f6nigl\n1980). Then n2 /n1 = 2.5 and \u03931 /\u03932 = 1.6, which\nis also approximately \u03b41 /\u03b42 . If the electrons are\nheated only by compression, the IC/CMB inten2\u03b1 4\nsity, IIC/CMB \u221d N0 \u03934 \u221d ne \u03b3min\n\u0393 , behind the\nshock is still \u223c 20 times the ambient value.\nEither a standing or moving shock model can\ntherefore account for the knotty structure, although an oblique standing shock is favored, since\nit also explains the deceleration and curvature of\nthe jet. Within the model, the slight displacement\nof the radio and X-ray intensity peaks (Fig. 7) implies that either the magnetic field or the density\nof electrons with \u03b3 \u223c 104 is higher near the shock\n7\n\n\ffront than 30-50 kpc downstream. In the moving shock model, the region of enhancement in B\nand/or N0 would need to be 30-50 kpc closer to\nthe nucleus than the location of the shock front.\nThis could be caused by turbulence that develops\nand amplifies the magnetic field behind the shock\n(Mizuno et al. 2010) and possibly also accelerates\nparticles. The displacement of the various knots\nfrom the jet axis implies that the shocks cover only\na fraction of the jet cross-section.\n4.4.\n\nessentially all of the energy within the TeV range.\nThe highly relativistic flow speed observed in the\nparsec-scale jet and the relativistic beaming implied by the one-sidedness of the kiloparsec-scale\njet support an IC/CMB model for the extended\nX-ray emission. Since the relatively low-energy\nelectrons involved have extremely long radiative\nlifetimes, the knotty structure of the jet requires\nshocks that compress the plasma and rarefactions\nthat lower the density again. The model that explains the widest range of observed properties involves a standing shock at an angle of 7\u25e6 to the\nupstream flow, which can explain the bending beyond 8\u2032\u2032 as well as the knot to inter-knot intensity\nratio and decrease in bulk Lorentz factor. The\nknotty structure can also arise from variations in\nthe jet flow on time-scales of thousands of years.\nThis results in moving shock waves followed by\nrarefactions. The knots lie at various positions\nrelative to the jet axis, which implies that, rather\nthan confinement to an extremely narrow spine,\nthe structure subtends a more normal (for relativistic jets) full opening angle of \u223c 2\u25e6 , similar\nthat that found on parsec scales.\nWe selected OJ287 because of its extended, although very weak, radio jet and its high apparent superluminal motion on parsec scales. Exploration with Chandra of the extended X-ray\nemission around other BL Lac objects with very\nweak kiloparsec-scale radio jets detectable with\nthe EVLA could discover more structures with\nhigh X-ray to radio flux ratios. Observations of\nsuch sources would further our knowledge of the\nphysical development of relativistic jets as they\npropagate through and beyond their host galaxies.\n\nComment on Spine-Sheath Models\n\nThe strong, one-sided extended X-ray jet in\nOJ287 is best explained if the flow velocity remains highly relativistic at least out to hundreds\nof kiloparsecs from the nucleus. We detect bright\nknots and ambient X-ray emission across \u223c 2\u2032\u2032\n(9 kpc) on both sides of the centroid of the jet\nalong much of its length. The length-to width ratio within 8\u2032\u2032 of the nucleus is only \u223c 2, which\nbecomes \u223c 30 when de-projected, corresponding\nto a full opening angle of \u223c 2\u25e6 when deprojected.\n(We note that this is similar to the opening angle of the parsec-scale jet derived\nby Jorstad et al. 2005, .)Therefore, either the\nspine is not an ultra-narrow pencil beam or its direction varies, as suggested by the placements of\nthe knots. Furthermore, the similar opening angle\non parsec and kiloparsec scales supports our conclusion that the extended jet remains relativistic,\nsince FR 1 jets that decelerate tend to broaden\nconsiderably on such scales (Laing et al. 1999).\n5.\n\nConclusions\n\nOur Chandra observations have revealed quite\nstrong X-ray emission from the extended jet of the\nBL Lac object OJ287, which has the unbeamed\nradio luminosity of an FR 1 source. The X-ray\nemission persists out to hundreds of kiloparsecs\nfrom the nucleus, while weak radio emission can\nbe seen beyond 1 Mpc. This demonstrates that\nthe main requirement for strong extended X-ray\nemission and an extremely long jet is a highly relativistic outflow, independent of the class of radio\nsource.\nThe observed SED of the extended jet of OJ287\neliminates synchrotron emission as the source of\nthe X-rays unless the electron energy distribution\ndiffers from those in other blazars by concentrating\n\nWe thank C.
