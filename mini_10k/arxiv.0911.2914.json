Although some of the topics outlined in this paper have already appeared in\nthe literature (see [11, 16, 24]), to date very little is known on the general Abelian theory of\nwords. In fact, prior to this paper, some of the key notions had not even been formally defined.\n\u2217\n\nUniversit\u00e9 de Picardie Jules Verne, Laboratoire MIS, 33 Rue Saint Leu, F-80039 Amiens cedex 1, France\nand Universit\u00e9 Paul-Val\u00e9ry Montpellier 3, Route de Mende, F-34199 Montpellier cedex 5, France, E-mail:\ngwenael.richomme@univ-montp3.fr\n\u2020\nDepartment of Mathematics, University of Turku, FI-20014, Finland, email: kasaar@utu.fi\n\u2021\nUniversit\u00e9 de Lyon, Universit\u00e9 Lyon 1, CNRS UMR 5208 Institut Camille Jordan, B\u00e2timent du\nDoyen Jean Braconnier, 43, blvd du 11 novembre 1918, F-69622 Villeurbanne Cedex, France, email:\nzamboni@math.univ-lyon1.fr Reykjavik University, School of Computer Science, Kringlan 1, 103 Reykjavik, Iceland, email: lqz@ru.is\n\n1\n\n\fGiven a finite non-empty set A (called the alphabet), we denote by A\u2217 , AN and AZ respectively the set of finite words, the set of (right) infinite words, and the set of bi-infinite words\nover the alphabet A. We endow AN with the topology generated by the metric\nd(x, y) =\n\n1\nwhere n = inf{k : xk 6= yk }\n2n\n\nwhenever x = (xn )n\u2208N and y = (yn )n\u2208N are two elements of AN . Let T : AN \u2192 AN denote\nthe shift transformation defined by T : (xn )n\u2208N 7\u2192 (xn+1 )n\u2208N . By a subshift on A we mean a\npair (X, T ) where X is a closed and T -invariant subset of AN . A subshift (X, T ) is said to be\nminimal whenever X and the empty set are the only T -invariant closed subsets of X.\nGiven a finite word u = a1 a2 . . . an with n \u2265 1 and ai \u2208 A, we denote the length n of u\nby |u|. The empty word will be denoted by \u03b5 and we set |\u03b5| = 0. For each a \u2208 A, we let |u|a\ndenote the number of occurrences of the letter a in u. Two words u and v in A\u2217 are said to be\nAbelian equivalent, denoted u \u223cab v, if and only if |u|a = |v|a for all a \u2208 A. It is readily\nverified that \u223cab defines an equivalence relation on A\u2217 .\nGiven an infinite word \u03c9 = \u03c90 \u03c91 \u03c92 . . . \u2208 AN with \u03c9i \u2208 A, we denote by F\u03c9 (n) the set\nof all factors of \u03c9 of length n, that is, the set of all finite words of the form \u03c9i \u03c9i+1 * * * \u03c9i+n\u22121\nwith i \u2265 0. We set\n\u03c1\u03c9 (n) = Card(F\u03c9 (n)).\nThe function \u03c1\u03c9 : N \u2192 N is called the subword complexity function of \u03c9. Given a minimal\nsubshift (X, T ) on A, we have that F\u03c9 (n) = F\u03c9\u2032 (n) for all \u03c9, \u03c9 \u2032 \u2208 X and n \u2208 N. Thus we\ncan define the subword complexity \u03c1(X,T ) (n) of a minimal subshift (X, T ) by\n\u03c1(X,T ) (n) = \u03c1\u03c9 (n)\nfor any \u03c9 \u2208 X.\nAnalogously we define F\u03c9ab (n) = F\u03c9 (n)/ \u223cab and set\nab\n\u03c1ab\n\u03c9 (n) = Card(F\u03c9 (n)).\nThe function \u03c1ab\n\u03c9 : N \u2192 N which counts the number of pairwise non Abelian equivalent\nfactors of \u03c9 of length n is called the Abelian complexity of \u03c9, or ab-complexity for short1 . As\nin the case of subword complexity, the definition of Abelian complexity naturally extends to\nthe context of a minimal subshift.\nIn most instances, the alphabet A will consist of the numbers {0, 1, 2, . . . , k \u2212 1}. In this\ncase, for each u \u2208 A\u2217 , we denote by \u03a8(u) the Parikh vector 2 associated to u, that is\n\u03a8(u) = (|u|0 , |u|1 , |u|2 , . . . , |u|k\u22121 ).\nGiven an infinite word \u03c9 \u2208 AN we set\n\u03a8\u03c9 (n) = {\u03a8(u) | u \u2208 F\u03c9 (n)}\n1\n\nA different, yet related notion of Abelian complexity, called Parikh complexity, was considered in [15].\nParikh matrices, an extension of Parikh vectors, were recently introduced to characterize words in terms of the\noccurrences of some scattered subwords (see, e.g., [21, 13, 29]).\n2\n\n2\n\n\fand thus we have \u03c1ab\n\u03c9 (n) = Card(\u03a8\u03c9 (n)).\nThere are a number of similarities between the usual subword complexity of an infinite\nword and its Abelian complexity. For instance both may be used to characterize periodic biinfinite words. Here a word \u03c9 is periodic if there exists a positive integer p such that \u03c9i+p = \u03c9i\nfor all indices i, and it is ultimately periodic if \u03c9i+p = \u03c9i for all sufficiently large i. An infinite\nword is aperiodic if it is not ultimately periodic.\nTheorem 1. Let \u03c9 be a bi-infinite word over the alphabet A. The following properties hold.\n\u2022 (M. Morse, G.A. Hedlund, [23]) The word \u03c9 is periodic if and only if \u03c1\u03c9 (n0 ) \u2264 n0 for\nsome n0 \u2265 1.\n\u2022 (E.M. Coven and G.A. Hedlund, [11] ) The word \u03c9 is periodic if and only if \u03c1ab (n ) = 1\n\u03c9\n\n0\n\nfor some n0 \u2265 1. (See also Lemma 2.3)\nThe condition in the first item of the previous theorem also gives rise to a characterization\nof ultimately periodic words by means of subword complexity. Abelian complexity does not,\nhowever, yield such a characterization. Indeed, both Sturmian words (see below) and the\nultimately periodic word 01\u221e = 0111 * * * have the same, constant 2, Abelian complexity.\nAs another example, both complexity functions may be used to characterize Sturmian\nwords:\nTheorem 2. Let \u03c9 be an aperiodic infinite word over the alphabet {0, 1}. The following\nconditions are equivalent:\n\u2022 The word \u03c9 is balanced, that is, Sturmian.\n\u2022 (M. Morse, G.A. Hedlund, [23]). The word \u03c9 satisfies \u03c1\u03c9 (n0 ) = n + 1 for all n \u2265 0.\n\u2022 (E.M. Coven, G.A. Hedlund, [11]). The word \u03c9 satisfies \u03c1ab (n) = 2 for all n \u2265 1. (See\n\u03c9\n\nalso the discussion in the beginning of Section 4).\nWe recall an infinite word \u03c9 \u2208 AN is said to be C-balanced (C a positive integer) if\n||U |a \u2212 |V |a | \u2264 C for all a \u2208 A and all factors U and V of \u03c9 of equal length. A word \u03c9 is\ncalled balanced it it is 1-balanced.\nHowever, in some cases the two complexities exhibit radically different behaviors. For\ninstance, as was originally pointed out to us by P. Arnoux [6], consider the binary Champernowne word\nC = 01101110010111011110001001 . . .\nobtained by concatenating the binary representation of the consecutive natural numbers. Let\n\u03c9 denote the morphic image of C under the Thue-Morse morphism \u03bc defined by 0 7\u2192 01\nand 1 7\u2192 10. Then while \u03c1\u03c9 (n) has exponential growth, we will see in Theorem 3.3 that\n\u03c1ab\n\u03c9 (n) \u2264 3 for all n.\nIn contrast, there exist infinite words having linear subword complexity and unbounded\nab-complexity. In fact, in [10], the third author together with J. Cassaigne and S. Ferenczi\nestablished the existence of a word with subword complexity \u03c1(n) = 2n + 1 which is not\n\n3\n\n\fC-balanced for any positive integer C. An infinite word \u03c9 \u2208 AN is said to be C-balanced (C\na positive integer) if ||U |a \u2212 |V |a | \u2264 C for all a \u2208 A and all factors U and V of \u03c9 of equal\nlength. We prove that\nLemma 3. \u03c1ab\n\u03c9 (n) is bounded if and only if \u03c9 is C-balanced for some positive integer C.\nHence the word constructed in [10] of subword complexity \u03c1(n) = 2n + 1 has unbounded\nab-complexity.\nFinally, in some cases, the two complexity functions work in tandem to give explicit characterizations of certain minimal subshifts. For instance we prove that\nTheorem 4. Let TM0 \u2208 {0, 1}N denote the fixed point beginning in 0 of the Thue-Morse\nmorphism 0 7\u2192 01, 1 7\u2192 10, and let \u03c9 be a recurrent infinite word. Then\n\u03c1\u03c9 (n) = \u03c1TM0 (n) n \u2208 N\nand\nab\n\u03c1ab\n\u03c9 (n) = \u03c1TM0 (n) n \u2208 N\nif and only if \u03c9 is in the subshift generated by TM0 .\nRecall that an infinite word is recurrent if each of its factors occurs infinitely often in w.\nInspired by the last characterization of Sturmian words given in Theorem 2, G. Rauzy\nasked the following question:\nQuestion 5 (G. Rauzy, [24]). Does there exist an infinite word \u03c9 whose ab-complexity \u03c1ab\n\u03c9 (n) =\n3 for all n \u2265 1.\nHe suggests that the likely answer to this question is NO. However, we give two positive\nsolutions to Rauzy's question:\nTheorem 6. Let \u03c9 be an aperiodic balanced word on the alphabet {0, 1, 2}. Then \u03c1ab\n\u03c9 (n) = 3\nfor all n \u2265 1.\nTheorem 7. Let \u03c9 \u2032 \u2208 {0, 1}N be any aperiodic infinite word, and let \u03c9 be the image of \u03c9 \u2032\nunder the morphism 0 7\u2192 012, and 1 7\u2192 021. Then \u03c1ab\n\u03c9 (n) = 3 for all n \u2265 1.\nIn Section 5, we investigate a surprising connection between Abelian complexity and\navoidance of Abelian powers. By an Abelian k-power we mean a non-empty word of the\nform w = u1 u2 * * * uk where the words ui are pairwise Abelian equivalent. In this case we say\nw has an Abelian period equal to u1 . Powers, or repetitions, occurring in an infinite word is a\ntopic of great interest having applications to a broad range of areas (see, e.g., [2, 3, 5, 20]). One\nstream of research dating back to the works of Thue [30, 31] is the study of patterns avoidable\nby infinite words (see, e.g., [18, 19, 25, 26, 7]). In the Abelian context, F.M. Dekking [12]\nshowed that Abelian 4-powers are avoidable on a binary alphabet and that Abelian cubes are\navoidable on a 3-letter alphabet. V. Ker\u00e4nen [17] proved that Abelian squares are avoidable on\nfour letters. We prove the following general result relating Abelian complexity and Abelian\nrepetitions.\n\n4\n\n\fTheorem 8. Let \u03c9 be an infinite word on a finite alphabet having bounded ab-complexity.\nThen \u03c9 contains an Abelian k-power for every positive integer k.\nIn view of Theorem 2, the previous theorem implies that Sturmian words admit occurrences\nof Abelian k-powers for all k. In Section 6 we show that actually these words possess a much\nstronger property:\nTheorem 9. For every Sturmian word \u03c9 and every positive integer k, there exist two integers\nl1 and l2 such that each position in \u03c9 has an occurrence of an Abelian k-power with Abelian\nperiod l1 or l2 . In particular, every Sturmian word begins in an Abelian k-power for all\npositive integers k.\n\nAcknowledgements The second author is partially supported by grant no. 8121419 from\nthe Finnish Academy.

In other\nwords, for all n \u2265 0, \u03c1ab\n\u03c9 (n) is the cardinality of the set of Parikh vectors of factors of length\nn of \u03c9.\nLet a, b be two letters in A = {0, . . . , p \u2212 1} and let u be a word over A. If a = b,\n\u03a8(au) = \u03a8(ub). When a 6= b, \u03a8(au) \u2212 \u03a8(ub) is the vector whose all entries are 0 except its\n(a + 1)-th entry with value +1 and its (b + 1)-th entry with value \u22121. This shows how Parikh\nvectors evolve when considering two successive factors of same length of a word \u03c9. As an\nimmediate consequence, we deduce the following fact that will be used very often implicitly.\nLemma 2.1. If an infinite word \u03c9 has two factors u and v of same length n for which the ith\nentry of the Parikh vector are p and p+c respectively for some p and c then for all l = 0, . . . , c,\nthere exist factors ul of \u03c9 whose ith entry is p + l.\nWith the notation of this fact, we can see that \u03c1ab\n\u03c9 (n) \u2265 c + 1. This implies:\nLemma 2.2. For a word \u03c9 \u2208 AN \u222a AZ , the function \u03c1ab\n\u03c9 is bounded if and only if \u03c9 is Cbalanced for some positive integer C.\nProof. If \u03c1ab\n\u03c9 is bounded by K, then \u03c9 is (K \u2212 1)-balanced. If \u03c9 is C-balanced, then entries\nof Parikh vectors of factors of \u03c9 can take at most C + 1 values, so that \u03c1ab\n\u03c9 (n) \u2264 (C +\ncard(A)\n1)\n.\nA natural question concerns the possible extremal values of the Abelian complexity. As\nshown by next result, minimal values are reached by periodic words.\n\n5\n\n\fLemma 2.3 (E.M. Coven and G.A. Hedlund, [11, Remark 4.07]). Let \u03c9 \u2208 AN \u222a AZ be a right\ninfinite or a bi-infinite word. Then \u03c9 is periodic of period p if and only if \u03c1ab\n\u03c9 (p) = 1.\nLet us recall that a word u is a right special factor of an infinite word \u03c9 if there exist\ndistinct letters \u03b1 and \u03b2 such that u\u03b1 and u\u03b2 are both factors of \u03c9.\nProof of Lemma 2.3. The \"only if\" part is immediate. The other direction can be deduced\nfrom the observation that a non-periodic word \u03c9 must contain arbitrarily long right special\nfactors implying \u03c1ab\n\u03c9 (n) \u2265 2 for all n \u2265 1.\nConcerning the maximal Abelian complexity, it is clear that it is reached by any infinite\nword containing all finite words as factors, as for instance the Champernowne word. Let us\ndenote \u03c1ab\nmax the Abelian complexity of such a word. Since, for any word u of length n over a\nk-letter alphabet, \u03a8(u) is a k-tuple (i1 , . . . , ik ) with n = i1 +i2 +. . .+ik , \u03c1ab\nmax is the maximum\nnumber of ways of writing n as the sum of k nonnegative integers. This well-known number\n(see, e.g., [32]) is called the number of compositions of n into k parts and and its value is given\n\u0001\nby the binomial coefficient n+k\u22121\nk\u22121 . This can be summarized:\nTheorem 2.4. For all infinite words \u03c9 over a k-letter alphabet, and for all n \u2265 0,\n\u0012\n\u0013\nn+k\u22121\nab\nab\n\u03c1\u03c9 (n) \u2264 \u03c1max (n) =\n.\nk\u22121\n\nIn particular, the ab-complexity is in O(nk\u22121 ).\nIn Section 1 we provided an example of an infinite word having an exponential subword\ncomplexity but a linear Abelian complexity. Here follows an example of a binary infinite word\nhaving maximal Abelian complexity but a linear subword complexity. Let f and g be the\nmorphisms defined by f (a) = abc, f (b) = bbb, f (c) = ccc, g(a) = 0 = g(c) and g(b) = 1.\nQ\ni\ni\nab\nThe image \u03c9 by g of the fixed point of f on a is the word 0 i\u22650 13 03 . That \u03c1ab\n\u03c9 = \u03c1max is\nimmediate. Since w is an automatic sequence, it has linear subword complexity (see Theorems\n6.3.2 and 10.3.1 in [4]).\n\n3 Abelian Complexity of the Thue-Morse Word\nLet us recall that the celebrated Thue-Morse word is the fixed point TM0 beginning in 0 of\nthe Thue-Morse morphism \u03bc defined by \u03bc(0) = 01 and \u03bc(1) = 10. Next theorem gives its\nAbelian complexity:\nab\nTheorem 3.1. \u03c1ab\nTM0 (n) = 2 for n odd and \u03c1TM0 (n) = 3 for n 6= 0 even.\nThis result is a direct corollary of Theorem 3.3 below which shows that this complexity\nis only due to the fact that TM0 is the image of a word by \u03bc. Moreover Theorem 3.3 characterizes the class of all words having same Abelian complexity as the Thue-Morse word.\n\n6\n\n\fCorollary 3.5 shows that the subshift generated by the Thue-Morse word can be distinguished\nin this class by its subword complexity.\nWe need a preliminary result:\nLemma 3.2. Let \u03c9 = \u03c90 \u03c91 \u03c92 . . . \u2208 {0, 1}N be an aperiodic infinite word. Then for every\nk \u2265 2, there exist factors U and V of \u03c9 of length k, with U = 0u1 and V = 1v0 for some\nwords u and v (possibly empty).\nProof. Suppose for some k \u2265 2, the aperiodic word \u03c9 does not contain a factor of length k\nbeginning in 0 and ending in 1. This implies that for each i \u2265 0, if \u03c9i = 0, then \u03c9i+k\u22121 = 0.\nThus for i sufficiently large we have that \u03c9i+k\u22121 = \u03c9i , and hence \u03c9 is eventually periodic, a\ncontradiction. Similarly, if \u03c9 does not contain a factor V of length k beginning in 1 and ending\nin 0, it would follow that \u03c9 is eventually periodic.\nTheorem 3.3. The Abelian complexity of an aperiodic word \u03c9 \u2208 {0, 1}N is\n(\n\u03c1ab\n\u03c9 (n) = 2 for n odd,\nab\n\u03c1\u03c9 (n) = 3 for n 6= 0 even,\nif and only if there exists a word \u03c9 \u2032 such that \u03c9 = \u03bc(\u03c9 \u2032 ), \u03c9 = 0\u03bc(\u03c9 \u2032 ) or \u03c9 = 1\u03bc(\u03c9 \u2032 ).\nProof. Assume first that the Abelian complexity of a word \u03c9 is 2 for n odd and 3 for n 6= 0\neven. We first prove by induction that for all k \u2265 0\n(\n\u03a8\u03c9 (2k + 1) = {(k + 1, k), (k, k + 1)} and\n\u03a8\u03c9 (2k + 2) = {(k + 1, k + 1), (k, k + 2), (k + 2, k)}.\nThe result is true for k = 0. Assume that \u03a8\u03c9 (2k + 2) is as above. Since \u03c1ab\n\u03c9 (2k + 3) = 2, by\nLemma 2.1 there exist integers p and q such that\n\u03a8\u03c9 (2k + 3) = {(p + 1, q), (p, q + 1)}.\nMoreover\n\u03a8\u03c9 (2k + 3) \u2286 \u03a8\u03c9 (2k + 2) + {(1, 0), (0, 1)}\n= {(k + 2, k + 1), (k + 1, k + 2), (k, k + 3), (k + 3, k)}.\nThus exactly one of the following three identities hold:\n\u03a8\u03c9 (2k + 3) = {(k + 2, k + 1), (k + 1, k + 2)},\n\u03a8\u03c9 (2k + 3) = {(k + 2, k + 1), (k + 3, k)},\n\u03a8\u03c9 (2k + 3) = {(k + 1, k + 2), (k, k + 3)}.\n\n7\n\n\fThe second identity is not possible, though, because (k, k + 2) \u2208 \u03a8\u03c9 (2k + 2). Similarly we\nsee that the third identity cannot hold, and therefore the first one does. Now\n\u03a8\u03c9 (2k + 4) \u2286 \u03a8\u03c9 (2k + 3) + {(1, 0), (0, 1)}\n= {(k + 3, k + 1), (k + 2, k + 2), (k + 1, k + 3)}.\nSince \u03c1ab\n\u03c9 (2k + 4) = 3, the previous inclusion is an equality, and the inductive part is proved.\nIt follows from \u03a8\u03c9 (3) = {(1, 2), (2, 1)} that 000 and 111 do not occur in w. Assume that\n\u03c9 has one factor of the form 11(01)k 011. This word has Parikh vector (k + 4, k + 1) which is\nnot possible from what precedes. Hence \u03c9 has no factor of the form 11(01)k 011 and similarly\nno factor of the form 00(10)k 100 (that is between two consecutive occurrences of 11 there is\nan occurrence of 00 and between two occurrences of 00 there is an occurrence of 11). Thus,\nsince \u03c9 is aperiodic, both 00 and 11 must occur infinitely often, so that \u03c9 can be decomposed\npu1 u2 . . . uk . . . with each ui in 1(01)\u2217 00(10)\u2217 1 and p a suffix of a word in 1(01)\u2217 00(10)\u2217 1.\nThis shows that \u03c9 = \u03bc(\u03c9 \u2032 ), \u03c9 = 0\u03bc(\u03c9 \u2032 ) or \u03c9 = 1\u03bc(\u03c9 \u2032 ) for a word \u03c9 \u2032 .\nAssume from now on that \u03c9 = \u03bc(\u03c9 \u2032 ), \u03c9 = 0\u03bc(\u03c9 \u2032 ) or \u03c9 = 1\u03bc(\u03c9 \u2032 ) for a word \u03c9 \u2032 .\nLet n = 2k + 1. Then every factor U of \u03c9 of length n is either of the form \u03bc(u)a or a\u03bc(u)\nfor some factor u of \u03c9 \u2032 of length k and some a \u2208 {0, 1}. It follows that\n\u03a8\u03c9 (n) \u2286 {(k + 1, k), (k, k + 1)}.\nab\nSince \u03c9 is aperiodic, by Lemma 2.3 we have that \u03c1ab\n\u03c9 (n) \u2265 2 and hence \u03c1\u03c9 (n) = 2.\nNext suppose n = 2k. Then every factor U of length n is either of the form \u03bc(u) or a\u03bc(v)b\nfor some factors u and v of \u03c9 \u2032 of length k and k \u2212 1 respectively, and for some a, b \u2208 {0, 1}.\nIt follows that\n\u03a8\u03c9 (n) \u2286 {(k, k), (k \u2212 1, k + 1), (k + 1, k \u2212 1)}.\nIt follows from Lemma 3.2 that \u03c9 \u2032 contains factors u\u2032 and v \u2032 of length k \u2212 1 with u\u2032 preceded\nby 0 and followed by 1 and v \u2032 preceded by 1 and followed by 0. Thus \u03c9 contains the factors of\nlength n of the form 1\u03bc(u\u2032 )1 and 0\u03bc(v \u2032 )0, whose corresponding Parikh vectors are (k \u2212 1, k +\n1), and (k + 1, k \u2212 1) respectively. Hence\n\u03a8\u03c9 (n) = {(k, k), (k \u2212 1, k + 1), (k + 1, k \u2212 1)}\nwhence \u03c1ab\n\u03c9 (n) = 3.\nRemark 3.4. The proof of the \"only if\" part of Theorem 3.3 easily extends to ultimately\nperiodic words as follows. If an ultimately periodic word \u03c9 has the same Abelian complexity\nas the Thue\u2013Morse word, then \u03c9 can be decomposed into pu1 . . . uk (01)\u221e or pu1 . . . uk (10)\u221e\nwith words p and ui as in the proof of Theorem 3.3. (By the notation u\u221e we mean the infinite\nword uuu * * * ) That is, \u03c9 is of the form \u03bc(vb\u221e ) or a\u03bc(vb\u221e ) with a, b \u2208 {0, 1} and for some\nfinite word v.\n\n8\n\n\fThe converse part of Theorem 3.3, however, does not extend to ultimately periodic words.\nIndeed, the word (01)\u221e = \u03bc(0\u221e ) is of the correct form, but it does not have the same Abelian\ncomplexity as the Thue-Morse word.\nWe end this section with:\nCorollary 3.5. Let TM0 \u2208 {0, 1}N denote the Thue-Morse word beginning in 0, and let \u03c9 be\na recurrent infinite word. Then\n\u03c1\u03c9 (n) = \u03c1TM0 (n) n \u2208 N\nand\nab\n\u03c1ab\n\u03c9 (n) = \u03c1TM0 (n) n \u2208 N\nif and only if \u03c9 is in the subshift generated by TM0 .\nProof. The \"only if\" part is clear. For the converse, we recall that in [1] it is shown that every\nrecurrent infinite word \u03c9 \u2208 {0, 1}N whose subword complexity is equal to that of TM0 is\neither in the shift orbit closure of TM0 or is in the shift orbit closure of \u2206(TM0 ) where \u2206\nis the letter doubling morphism defined by 0 7\u2192 00 and 1 7\u2192 11. However, if \u03c9 \u2208 {0, 1}N is\nin the shift orbit closure of \u2206(TM0 ), then it would contain the 4 factors 111, 110, 100, 000 of\nlength 3, and hence \u03c1ab\n\u03c9 (3) = 4. Thus \u03c9 is in the shift orbit closure of TM0 .\n\n4 Two Answers to a Question of G. Rauzy\nRecall that a Sturmian word is an aperiodic binary balanced word. Among the few existing\nfamilies of words characterized using Abelian complexity, the following one concerning Sturmian words is the earliest one we know.3 It is essentially due to E.M. Coven and G.A. Hedlund\n(an easy consequence of Lemma 4.02 and remark 4.07 in [11]).\nTheorem 4.1 (E.M. Coven, G.A. Hedlund). Let \u03c9 be a binary right infinite word. Then \u03c9 is\naperiodic and balanced (i.e., a Sturmian word) if and only if \u03c1ab\n\u03c9 (n) = 2 for all n \u2265 1.\nInspired by this characterization of Sturmian words, Rauzy asked whether there exist aperiodic words on a 3-letter alphabet such that \u03c1ab (n) = 3 for all n \u2265 1 (see section 6.2 in [24]).\nOur next two results provide two different solutions to Rauzy's question.\nLet p \u2265 3 be any integer, let \u03c9 \u2032 be any Sturmian word over {0, 1} and let \u03c9 = (p \u2212\n1)(p \u2212 2) . . . 2\u03c9 \u2032 (\u03c9 is written over the alphabet {0, 1, . . . , (p \u2212 1)}. As a consequence of\nTheorem 4.1, we can see that \u03c1ab\n\u03c9 (n) = p for all n \u2265 1 (in particular when p = 3). This\nprovides one answer to Rauzy's question. Nevertheless it is not completely satisfactory since\n3\n\nI. Kabor\u00e9 and T. Tapsoba also characterized using Abelian complexity the family of so-called quasi-Sturmian by\ninsertion words (a subclass of the class of infinite words over a three-letter alphabet having subword complexity n + 2)\n[16]. These words defined over a ternary alphabet verify \u03c1ab (n) = 2 for n 6= 0 even and \u03c1ab (n) = 4 for n 6= 1 odd.\n\n9\n\n\fw is not recurrent. The next two results give two distinct classes of uniformly recurrent words\n(each factor occurs infinitely often with bounded gaps) having constant ab-complexity equal\nto 3.\nTheorem 4.2. Let \u03c9 be an aperiodic uniformly recurrent balanced word on the alphabet\n{0, 1, 2}. Then \u03c1ab\n\u03c9 (n) = 3 for all n \u2265 1.\nProof. Let \u03c9 be an aperiodic uniformly recurrent balanced word on the alphabet {0, 1, 2}.\nP. Hubert showed that up to word isomorphism, \u03c9 is obtained from a Sturmian word x \u2208\n{x, y}N by replacing the subsequence of x's in x by the periodic word (01)\u221e and the subsequence of y's in x by the periodic word 2\u221e (see Theorem 1 in [14]). In particular we have\nthat\n1. Deleting all occurrences of 2 in \u03c9 gives the periodic sequence (01)\u221e .\n2. h(\u03c9) = x where h : {0, 1, 2} \u2192 {x, y} is the morphism defined by h(0) = h(1) = x,\nand h(2) = y.\n3. If a \u2208 {0, 1} and ua and va are distinct factors of \u03c9, then h(u) 6= h(v).\nItem 3 follows from item 1 together with the fact that if h(u) = h(v), then either u = v, or\n|u| = |v| and every occurrence of 0 (respectively 1) in u is an occurrence of 1 (respectively 0)\nin v (that is u = (01)k 0, v = (10)k 1 for some k \u2265 0).\nSince \u03c9 is a balanced word, we observe that if it has Parikh vectors (i, j, k) and\n(i + 1, j \u2212 1, k) for some integers i, j, k then the only other possible vectors in \u03a8\u03c9 (n) are\n(i + 1, j, k \u2212 1) and (i, j \u2212 1, k + 1), and these two vectors cannot occur simultaneously\nin \u03a8\u03c9 (n). Consequently \u03c1ab\n\u03c9 (n) \u2264 3 for all n \u2265 1. In what follows, we will show that\nab\n\u03c1\u03c9 (n) \u2265 3 for all n \u2265 1.\nApplying Theorem 2 in [14], we deduce that \u03c1\u03c9 (n) = 2(n + 1) for all n sufficiently\nlarge. This in turn implies that for every n \u2265 1, either Case 1: \u03c9 contains a (right special)\nfactor u of length n such that each of u0, u1, u2 are each factors of \u03c9, or Case 2: \u03c9 contains\ntwo (right special) factors u and v of length n such that ua, ub, vc, vd are each factors of \u03c9\nfor some a, b, c, d \u2208 {0, 1, 2} with a 6= b and c 6= d. In Case 1, by considering the Parikh\nvector associated to the suffix of length n of each of u0, u1, u2, we obtain three distinct Parikh\nvectors, and hence \u03c1ab\n\u03c9 (n) \u2265 3.\nWe next consider Case 2. In this case we will show that each of 0, 1, 2 is in {a, b, c, d}.\nAssume to the contrary that 2 \u2208\n/ {a, b, c, d}. Then {a, b, c, d} = {0, 1}. But then by item 1\nabove, neither 0 nor 1 occur in u and in v, and thus u = 2n and v = 2n contradicting that\nu 6= v. Thus 2 \u2208 {a, b, c, d}. Next suppose that 0 \u2208\n/ {a, b, c, d}. Then u1, u2, v1, v2 are all\nfactors of y. It follows by item 3 above that h(u) 6= h(v). But as h(1) 6= h(2), it follows that\nh(u) and h(v) are distinct right special factors of x of length n, contradicting that a Sturmian\nword has exactly one right special factor of every length. Hence, we have 0 \u2208 {a, b, c, d}.\nSimilarly we deduce that 1 \u2208 {a, b, c, d}.\nHaving established that {a, b, c, d} = {0, 1, 2}, by considering the Parikh vector of u, v,\nand of the suffix of length n of each of ua, ub, vc, vd, we obtain at least three distinct Parikh\nvectors, and hence \u03c1ab\n\u03c9 (n) \u2265 3.\n\n10\n\n\fTheorem 4.3. Let \u03c9 \u2032 \u2208 {0, 1}N be any aperiodic infinite word, and let \u03c9 be the image of \u03c9 \u2032\nunder the morphism f defined by 0 7\u2192 012, and 1 7\u2192 021. Then \u03c1ab\n\u03c9 (n) = 3 for all n \u2265 1.\nProof. We first note that:\n1. For every factor U of \u03c9, there exist a suffix x (possibly empty) of 012 or of 021, a prefix\ny (possibly empty) of either 012 or of 021, and a factor u (possibly empty) of \u03c9 \u2032 , such\nthat U = xf (u)y.\n2. By Lemma 3.2, for every suffix x of 012 (respectively 021) and for every prefix y of 021\n(respectively 012), and for every k \u2265 0, there exists a factor u of \u03c9 \u2032 of length k such that\nxf (u)y is a factor of \u03c9 of length 3k + |x| + |y|.\nIn order to prove that \u03c1ab (n) = 3 we consider separately the case where n \u2261 0 (mod 3),\n\u03c9\n\nn \u2261 1 (mod 3), and n \u2261 2 (mod 3). In each case, we simply count the number of distinct\nParikh vectors associated to words of the form xf (u)y with x and y as in item 1 above and\nwith |x| + |y| \u2261 n (mod 3). In each case this gives that \u03c1ab\n\u03c9 (n) \u2264 3. Similarly, by counting\nthe number of distinct Parikh vectors associated to words of the form xf (u)y with x and y as\nin item 2 above and with |x| + |y| \u2261 n (mod 3), we find that \u03c1ab\n\u03c9 (n) \u2265 3.\nHaving answered Rauzy's original question, we may now ask:\nOpen problem 1. Does there exist a recurrent infinite word \u03c9 with \u03c1ab\n\u03c9 (n) = 4 for every\nn \u2265 1?\nWe suspect that the answer is NO! Using Hubert's main characterization of uniformly\nrecurrent aperiodic balanced words given in [14], it can be shown that if \u03c1ab\n\u03c9 (n) = 4 for every\nn \u2265 1, then \u03c9 is not balanced. While we suspect that the answer to the above question is no,\nAleksi Saarela [27] recently showed that for every positive integer k, there exists an infinite\nword whose Abelian complexity at n equals k for all sufficiently large n.\n\n5 Bounded Abelian Complexity\nBy a well-known result of V. Ker\u00e4nen [17], Abelian squares are avoidable over quaternary\nalphabets. This is to be contrasted with the following result, which says that avoiding Abelian\npowers while keeping the Abelian complexity bounded is impossible.\nTheorem 5.1. Let \u03c9 be an infinite word on a finite alphabet having bounded ab-complexity.\nThen \u03c9 contains an Abelian k-power for every positive integer k.\nRemark 5.2. Unlike with Abelian complexity, low subword complexity does not guarantee\nexistence of repetitions. For example, the Fibonacci word does not contain any 4th powers [22],\nyet its subword complexity is minimal amongst all aperiodic infinite words.\n\n11\n\n\fWe begin proving Theorem 5.1 with the following lemma:\nLemma 5.3. Let M and r be positive integers. Then there exist positive integers \u03b11 , \u03b12 , . . . , \u03b1r\nand N such that whenever\nr\nX\nci \u03b1i \u2261 0 (mod N )\ni=1\n\nfor integers ci with |ci | \u2264 M for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 r, then c1 = c2 = * * * = cr = 0.\n\nProof. We define \u03b1i inductively as follows: Set \u03b11 = 1, and for i \u2265 1, choose\n\u03b1i+1 > M\n\ni\nX\n\n\u03b1j .\n\nj=1\n\nLet N be any integer with N > M\n\nPr\n\nr\nX\n\nj=1 \u03b1j .\n\nNow suppose that\n\nci \u03b1i \u2261 0\n\n(mod N )\n\ni=1\n\nwith each |ci | \u2264 M. Then\n|\n\nr\nX\n\nci \u03b1i | \u2264\n\ni=1\n\nr\nX\n\n|ci |\u03b1i \u2264 M\n\n\u03b1i < N.\n\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\nHence\n\nr\nX\n\nr\nX\n\nci \u03b1i = 0.\n\nt\u22121\nX\n\n|ci |\u03b1i \u2264 M\n\ni=1\n\nTo see that each ci = 0, suppose to the contrary that some ci 6= 0, and let t denote the largest\npositive integer 1 \u2264 t \u2264 r for which ct 6= 0. If t = 1, then we have c1 = c1 \u03b11 = 0, a\ncontradiction. Otherwise, if t > 1,\n|ct \u03b1t | = | \u2212\n\nt\u22121\nX\ni=1\n\nci \u03b1i | \u2264\n\nt\u22121\nX\n\n\u03b1i < \u03b1t \u2264 |ct \u03b1t |,\n\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\na contradiction.\n\nWe now recall the following well-known result due to van de Waerden:\nTheorem 5.4 (van der Waerden's theorem - see, e.g., chapter 3 in [18]). If N is partitioned into\nk classes, then one of the classes contains arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions.\nProof of Theorem 5.1. Let r = Card(A). By hypothesis there exists a positive integer M such\nthat \u03c1ab\n\u03c9 (n) \u2264 M for every n \u2265 1. Thus for every (a1 , a2 , . . . , ar ), (b1 , b2 , . . . , br ) \u2208 \u03a8\u03c9 (n),\nwe have |ai \u2212 bi | \u2264 M for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 r. Let \u03b11 , \u03b12 , . . . , \u03b1r and N be as in Lemma 5.3. Up\n\n12\n\n\fto word isomorphism, we may regard \u03c9 = \u03c91 \u03c92 \u03c93 . . . as an infinite word on the alphabet\n{\u03b11 , \u03b12 , . . . , \u03b1r }. For each 1 \u2264 i \u2264 j we set \u03c9[i,j] = \u03c9i . . . \u03c9j , and\nX\n\n\u03c9[i,j] = \u03c9i + * * * + \u03c9j .\n\nNow consider the following function:\n\u03bd : {1, 2, 3, . . .} \u2192 {0, 1, . . . , N \u2212 1}\ndefined by\n\u03bd(t) =\n\nX\n\n\u03c9[1,t]\n\n(mod N ).\n\nBy van der Waerden's Theorem, for every positive integer k, there exist positive integers t0\nand s such that\n\u03bd(t0 ) = \u03bd(t0 + s) = \u03bd(t0 + 2s) = * * * = \u03bd(t0 + ks).\n(1)\nFor each 1 \u2264 j \u2264 k, set\n\u03c9 [j] = \u03c9[t0 +(j\u22121)s+1,t0 +js] .\nThen by (1)\nX\n\n\u03c9 [j] \u2261 0 (mod N )\n\n(2)\n\nfor each 1 \u2264 j \u2264 k.\n[j] [j]\n[j]\nWe will show that \u03a8(\u03c9 [j]) = \u03a8(\u03c9 [1] ) for every 1 \u2264 j \u2264 k. Set \u03a8(\u03c9 [j]) = (a1 , a2 , . . . , ar ).\nBy (2)\nr\nr\nX\nX\n[1]\n[j]\nai \u03b1i (mod N ),\nai \u03b1i \u2261\ni=1\n\nand hence\n\ni=1\n\nr\nX\n[j]\n[1]\n(ai \u2212 ai )\u03b1i \u2261 0 (mod N ).\ni=1\n\n[j]\n\n[1]\n\nMoreover as |\u03c9 [j] | = |\u03c9 [1] | for each 1 \u2264 j \u2264 k, we have that |ai \u2212 ai | \u2264 M. By Lemma 5.3\n[1]\n[j]\nwe deduce that ai \u2212 ai = 0 and hence that \u03a8(\u03c9 [j] ) = \u03a8(\u03c9 [1] ) for every 1 \u2264 j \u2264 k. Thus\nthe factor \u03c9 [1] \u03c9 [2] * * * \u03c9 [k] is an Abelian k- power of \u03c9.\n\nCorollary 5.5. Let k be a positive integer and \u03c9 an infinite word which avoids Abelian kpowers. Then \u03c9 is arbitrarily imbalanced, that is, \u03c9 is not C balanced for any positive integer\nC.\nProof. This follows immediately from Theorem 5.1 together with Lemma 2.2.\nTheorem 5.1 naturally gives rise to the following question.\nOpen problem 2. Does every uniformly recurrent infinite word with bounded Abelian complexity begin with an Abelian k-power for each positive integer k?\n\n13\n\n\fThis problem seems difficult to solve even for some very well-known words. For example,\nit can be shown that every shift of the Tribonacci word begins in an Abelian k-power for all\nk, but we do not know if this is true for every word in its orbit closure. It can also be shown\nthat every shift of the Thue-Morse word begins in an Abelian 6-power, but again, we do not\nknow whether this holds for larger Abelian powers or for every word in the orbit closure of the\nThue\u2013Morse word. In the next section, however, we show that the question does hold true in\nthe case of Sturmian words, even in a very strong form.\n\n6 Abelian repetitions in Sturmian words\nIn this section, we prove the following theorem, thereby answering Open Problem 2 in the\naffirmative in the case of Sturmian words.\nTheorem 6.1. For every Sturmian word \u03c9 and every positive integer k, there exist two integers\nl1 and l2 such that each position in \u03c9 begins in an Abelian k-power U1 U2 . . . Uk with Abelian\nperiod l1 or l2 , that is |Ui | \u2208 {l1 , l2 }. In particular, every Sturmian word begins in an Abelian\nk-power for all positive integers k.\nRemark 6.2. Theorem 6.1 should be contrasted with the fact that there exist Sturmian words\nwhose initial critical exponent is equal to 2 (see [9]). We also note that the existence of two\nAbelian periods in Theorem 6.1 is optimal in the sense that any word with the property that\nevery position starts with an Abelian k-power with a fixed Abelian period m is necessarily\nultimately periodic.\nLet us recall [8] that an infinite word is Sturmian if and only if its set of factors coincides\nwith that of a characteristic word. A characteristic word is an infinite word c\u03b1 , depending on\nan irrational number \u03b1 with 0 < \u03b1 < 1, such that\nc\u03b1 (n) = \u230a\u03b1(n + 1)\u230b \u2212 \u230a\u03b1n\u230b\nfor all n \u2265 1. Equivalently the characteristic word c\u03b1 can also be defined by\nc\u03b1 (n) = Rn (\u03b1)\nwhere\nRn (\u03b1) =\n\n(\n\n(n \u2265 1),\n\n0 if {n\u03b1} < 1 \u2212 \u03b1;\n1 otherwise.\n\nFor positive integers i \u2264 j we put\nc\u03b1 [i, j] = c\u03b1 (i)c\u03b1 (i + 1) * * * c\u03b1 (j).\nIn the proof of the next lemma, we use the well-known fact that, for all real numbers x, y, \u03b1,\nwe have\n(\n{x} \u2212 {y}\nor\n{x + \u03b1} \u2212 {y + \u03b1} =\n(3)\n1 \u2212 {x} \u2212 {y} .\n\n14\n\n\fLemma 6.3. Suppose that \u03b1 is irrational with 0 < \u03b1 < 1/2. Suppose also that i, j \u2265 1 are\nintegers such that {i\u03b1} \u2212 {j\u03b1} < \u03b1. If k \u2265 1 is an integer such that\nRi+k (\u03b1) = Rj+k (\u03b1),\nthen the words\nc\u03b1 [i, i + k] and\n\nc\u03b1 [j, j + k]\n\n(4)\n\nare Abelian equivalent.\nProof. In Eq. (4), denote the word on the left by Wi and the one on the right by Wj . Since\nRi+k (\u03b1) = Rj+k (\u03b1), we have\n{(i + k)\u03b1} \u2212 {(j + k)\u03b1} < max{\u03b1, 1 \u2212 \u03b1} = 1 \u2212 \u03b1.\nHence from {i\u03b1} \u2212 {j\u03b1} < \u03b1 and Eq. (3), we deduce that\n{i\u03b1} \u2212 {j\u03b1} = {(i + k)\u03b1} \u2212 {(j + k)\u03b1} .\nHypothesis Ri+k (\u03b1) = Rj+k (\u03b1) also implies that\n{(i + k)\u03b1} \u2212 {(j + k)\u03b1} = {(i + k + 1)\u03b1} \u2212 {(j + k + 1)\u03b1}\nand so\n{(i + k + 1)\u03b1} \u2212 {(j + k + 1)\u03b1} < \u03b1.\nThe number of letters 1 in Wi is given by\nWi\n\n1\n\n=\n\nk\nX\n\nc\u03b1 (i + h) =\n\nh=0\n\nk\nX\nh=0\n\nand similarly for Wj . These give\nWj\n\n1\n\n\u2212 Wi\n\n1\n\n=\n\n\u0001\n\u230a(i + h + 1)\u03b1\u230b \u2212 \u230a(i + h)\u03b1\u230b = \u230a(i + k + 1)\u03b1\u230b \u2212 \u230ai\u03b1\u230b,\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u230a(j + k + 1)\u03b1\u230b \u2212 \u230aj\u03b1\u230b \u2212 \u230a(i + k + 1)\u03b1\u230b \u2212 \u230ai\u03b1\u230b\n\n= \u230ai\u03b1\u230b \u2212 \u230aj\u03b1\u230b + \u230a(j + k + 1)\u03b1\u230b \u2212 \u230a(i + k + 1)\u03b1\u230b\n= i\u03b1 \u2212 {i\u03b1} \u2212 j\u03b1 + {j\u03b1} + (j + k + 1)\u03b1\u2212\n\n{(j + k + 1)\u03b1} \u2212 (i + k + 1)\u03b1 + {(i + k + 1)\u03b1}\n\u2264 {j\u03b1} \u2212 {i\u03b1} + {(i + k + 1)\u03b1} \u2212 {(j + k + 1)\u03b1}\n< 2\u03b1 < 1.\nConsequently, Wi and Wj are Abelian equivalent.\nIn the proof of the next theorem, we will use the following fact: for all real numbers x, y\nand integers p \u2265 1, we have\n{x + py} = {x} + p{y} \u2212 (p \u2212 q),\nwhere q is the integer for which\np \u2212 q \u2264 {x} + p{y} < p \u2212 q + 1.\n\n15\n\n(5)\n\n\fTheorem 6.4. Let \u03b1 be irrational with 0 < \u03b1 < 1. For all positive integers k and i, there is\nan Abelian k-power occurring at position i in c\u03b1 .\nProof. It is a well-known fact that c1\u2212\u03b1 is obtained from c\u03b1 by exchanging letters 0 and 1 (see\n[8, Cor. 2.2.20]). Therefore, without loss of generality, we may suppose that \u03b1 < 1/2. To\nshow that there exists an Abelian k-power at the ith position in c\u03b1 , let us choose a real number\n\u03b4 with\n0 < \u03b4 < \u03b1.\n(6)\nWe have two cases to consider:\nCase 1. We have\n0 \u2264 {i\u03b1} < \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b4,\n\nor \u03b1 \u2264 {i\u03b1} < 1 \u2212 \u03b4.\n\n(7)\n\nNone of these intervals is empty by Eq. (6) and since \u03b1 < 1/2.\nLet l be a positive integer such that\n{l\u03b1} < \u03b4/k.\n\n(8)\n\nThis choice of l and the inequality {i\u03b1} < 1 \u2212 \u03b4 imply that, for all 0 \u2264 j \u2264 k, we have\n{i\u03b1} + j{l\u03b1} < 1 \u2212\n\n(k \u2212 j)\u03b4\n\u2264 1,\nk\n\nso from Eq. (5) we get\nThis and Eq. (8) give\n\n\b\n\n\u0001\ni + jl \u03b1 = {i\u03b1} + j{l\u03b1}.\n\n{i\u03b1} \u2264 {(i + jl)\u03b1} < {i\u03b1} + \u03b4\n\n(9)\n\nfor all 0 \u2264 j \u2264 k. These imply that if {i\u03b1} < \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b4, then we have\nRi+l\u22121 (\u03b1) = Ri+2l\u22121 (\u03b1) = * * * = Ri+kl\u22121 (\u03b1) = 1.\nSimilarily, if {i\u03b1} \u2265 \u03b1, inequalities (9) imply\nRi+l\u22121 (\u03b1) = Ri+2l\u22121 (\u03b1) = * * * = Ri+kl\u22121 (\u03b1) = 0.\nBy these observations, Lemma 6.3 says that the k words\nc\u03b1 [i + jl, i + (j + 1)l \u2212 1]\n\n(0 \u2264 j \u2264 k \u2212 1)\n\nof length l are Abelian equivalent. Therefore c\u03b1 [ i, i + kl \u2212 1 ] is an Abelian k-power.\nCase 2. We have\n\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b4 \u2264 {i\u03b1} < \u03b1,\n\nor\n\n1 \u2212 \u03b4 \u2264 {i\u03b1} < 1.\n\n(10)\n\nNow we choose a positive integer l such that\n1\u2212\n\n\u03b1\u2212\u03b4\n< {l\u03b1} < 1.\nk\n\n16\n\n(11)\n\n\fSince {i\u03b1} \u2265 \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b4, we have, for all 0 \u2264 j \u2264 k,\n1 + j > {i\u03b1} + j{l\u03b1} > j +\n\n(k \u2212 j)(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b4)\n\u2265 j.\nk\n\nHence by Eq. (5),\n\b\n\n\u0001\ni + jl \u03b1 = {i\u03b1} \u2212 j(1 \u2212 {l\u03b1}),\n\nand so the lower bound for {l\u03b1} in Eq. (11) gives\n\n{i\u03b1} \u2212 (\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b4) < {(i + jl)\u03b1} \u2264 {i\u03b1}\n\n(12)\n\nfor all 0 \u2264 j \u2264 k.\nNow if {i\u03b1} \u2265 1 \u2212 \u03b4, we have\n{(i + jl)\u03b1} > 1 \u2212 \u03b1 > \u03b1\nfor all 0 \u2264 j \u2264 k, and this gives\nRi+l\u22121 (\u03b1) = Ri+2l\u22121 (\u03b1) = * * * = Ri+kl\u22121 (\u03b1) = 0.\nOtherwise {i\u03b1} < \u03b1, and we have\nRi+l\u22121 (\u03b1) = Ri+2l\u22121 (\u03b1) = * * * = Ri+kl\u22121 (\u03b1) = 1.\nBy these equations and Eq. (12), Lemma 6.3 implies that the k words\nc\u03b1 [i + jl, i + (j + 1)l \u2212 1]\n\n(0 \u2264 j \u2264 k \u2212 1)\n\nof length l are Abelian equivalent, and so the word c\u03b1 [ i, i + kl \u2212 1 ] is an Abelian k-power.\n\nLet us denote by \u03b1 = [ 0; a1 , a2 , a3 , . . . ] the continued fraction expansion of \u03b1. For n \u2265 0,\ndenote\npn\n= [ 0; a1 , . . . , an ],\nqn\nwhere gcd(qn , pn ) = 1. We will need the next two basic properties of continued fractions.\n(1) We have qn+1 > qn for all n \u2265 1.\n(2) If n \u2265 0 is even, we have\n\npn\n1\n<\n;\nqn\nqn qn+1\n\n(13)\n\n1\npn\n\u2212\u03b1 <\n.\nqn\nqn qn+1\n\n(14)\n\n0<\u03b1\u2212\nand if n is odd, we have\n0<\n\n17\n\n\fProof of Theorem 6.1. Let \u03b1 denote the slope of the Sturmian word \u03c9. The set of factors of \u03c9\ncoincides with that of the characteristic word c\u03b1 , so it suffices to prove the claim for c\u03b1 .\nAs in the proof of Theorem 6.4, we assume that \u03b1 < 1/2 and let \u03b4 be a real number with\n0 < \u03b4 < \u03b1. As limn\u2192\u221e qn = +\u221e there exists an even integer n \u2265 0 such that\nqn+1 >\n\nk\n.\nmin{\u03b4, \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b4}\n\nEq. (13) then implies that\n{qn \u03b1} = qn \u03b1 \u2212 pn <\n\n1\nqn+1\n\n<\n\nmin{\u03b4, \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b4}\n\u03b4\n\u2264 .\nk\nk\n\nConsequently, if {i\u03b1} is contained in one of the intervals of Case 1 in the proof of Theorem 6.4,\nwe may choose l = qn , and then the word c\u03b1 [ i, i+kl\u22121 ] is an Abelian k-power with Abelian\nperiod qn .\nIf {i\u03b1} is in one of the intervals of Case 2, we may choose l = qn+1 . Indeed, then by\nEq. (14), we have\n1 \u2212 {qn+1 \u03b1} = pn+1 \u2212 \u03b1qn+1 <\n\n1\nmin{\u03b4, \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b4}\n1\n.\n<\n<\nqn+2\nqn+1\nk\n\nThat is\n\n\u03b1\u2212\u03b4\n< {qn+1 \u03b1} < 1.\nk\nNow by the proof of Case 2, the word c\u03b1 [ i, i + kl \u2212 1 ] is an Abelian k-power with Abelian\nperiod qn+1 ; the claim follows.\n1\u2212\n\nRemark 6.5. The property of Sturmian words given in Theorem 6.1 does not provide a characterization of Sturmian words. For instance, this same property is also satisfied by any word\nof the form f (\u03c9) with \u03c9 a Sturmian word and where f is the morphism defined by f (0) = 00\nand f (1) = 01.\nRemark 6.6. According to the terminology introduced in [28], Sturmian words are everywhere\nAbelian repetitive.\n\nReferences\n[1] A. Aberkane and S. Brlek. Sequences having the Thue-Morse complexity.
