The catalogue of sources so far detected by this ground-based technique includes mainly supernova remnants\n(SNR) (see e.g. (1), (2), (3)) and active galaxies (AGN) (see e.g. (4) and references therein), although recently, new classes of objects such as OB star\nassociations (5) and binary systems (6), have been confirmed to be sources\nof high energy gamma-rays. Also, a recent survey of the galactic plane has\nyielded a significant signal from the region of the galactic center (7) and the\ndiscovery of a series of objects lying along the galactic plane (8). The nature\nof the physics addressed via high energy gamma-ray measurements includes\nclues to the understanding of the origin of cosmic rays, the nature of AGN\njets and the density if the extragalactic infrared background. In addition, several fundamental topics of particle physics can be probed, including searches\nfor TeV-scale WIMP annihilations (see (9) and references therein), limits on\nradiative neutrino decay (10) and a fundamental test of Lorentz invariance\nbased on studies of the propagation of very high energy radiation over extragalactic distances (11). The sensitivities of such searches are among the very\nbest achieved by any technique.\nAlmost all current ground-based gamma-ray efforts have concentrated primarily on improving the sensitivities to lower energies so as to overlap more with\nsatellite-based observations and potentially map out a larger range of sources.\nThe approaches to this have generally involved increasing the density of camera pixels, increasing the mirror area and using multiple telescopes. However,\nit is of interest to note that many of the physics topics mentioned above actually stand to benefit most from improved measurements at higher energies. It\nis in this regime where AGN spectra and short timescale flux variability most\ncritically test acceleration mechanisms as well as uniquely probe the extragalactic infrared background radiation. These higher energy emissions permit\nthe direct study of some of the most extreme and poorly understood environments in the universe. There are now several sources known to produce\ngamma-ray emission in the regime above 10 TeV, with evidence of some producing gamma-ray emission up to 40 TeV (see e.g. (3)), and potentially as\nhigh as 100 TeV (12). Establishing the actual range of this emission would,\nin itself, be of substantial interest. Furthermore, it is generally acknowledged\nthat much greater sky coverage is desired to study extended sources (3), to\nbetter explore the gamma-ray sky and to more continuously monitor multiple\nsources to study transient behaviour. The approaches so far taken have led\nto only a modest improvement in this regard, causing many to suggest the\nneed for either a 'brute force' use of many tens of telescopes or some \"new\ntechnology\" to allow larger sky coverage at high sensitivity (e.g. (13), (14)).\n2\n\n\fOur purpose here is to explore a possible method for greatly increasing the\nsensitivity of ACT instruments using an approach which is practical, economical and does not rely on the development of any new technology (15). This\napproach involves the use of cameras with a relatively large field of view, which\nhas the additional advantage of acting as a test-bed for the development of\n\"all-sky\" instruments. While initially motivated to improve the sensitivity at\nhigher energies (as in, e.g., (16)), the approach is seen to lead to improvements\nfor energies at least as low as 300 GeV. In this present paper, we will develop\nthe basic concept and characteristics of this technique using simulations applied to the case of both a single \"Wide Field Of View\" telescope (WFOV-1)\nand a tandem telescope design (WFOV-2). In a later paper, we will extend\nthis approach to a small array and even larger fields of view to explore more\ndetails of the range and sensitivity of this approach.\n\n2\n\nThe \u010cerenkov Lateral Distribution of Air Showers and \"Widefield\" Imaging\n\nExtensive air showers induced by primary gamma-rays in the regime near\n1 TeV are known to produce a lateral distribution of \u010cerenkov light at sea\nlevel with a relatively constant photon density for distances within \u223c130 m\nfrom the shower core (17). By a distance of \u223c200 m from the core, the density\nfalls by a factor of 2-3 from this value. Consequently, ACTs have generally concentrated on measuring showers landing within the \"inner light pool,\" where\nthe \u223cconstant photon intensity is at its maximum and its relation to the primary gamma-ray energy is not particularly dependent on a precise knowledge\nof the core location. This naturally confines the effective areas of individual\ntelescopes to the order of a few times 104 m2 . However, this form of the lateral\ndistribution is also known to change as a function of both detection altitude\nand primary energy. As an example, figure 1a shows that, for an altitude of\n2400 m above sea level and for primary energies of \u223c2 TeV or more, there\nis no longer any distinctive plateau at smaller core distances and the density\nfalls in a nearly continuous \u223cexponential fashion. Therefore, the choice of a\nfiducial radius for analysis becomes somewhat arbitrary.\nIf one were to instead base this fiducial radius purely on the observable light\nlevel, figure 1a also indicates that the ability of current ACTs to easily trigger\nfor energies of less than 1 TeV would imply that a 10 TeV gamma-ray could\nbe seen beyond a distance of \u223c500 m. This would correspond to an effective\narea more than an order of magnitude larger than existing ACTs, and it is\nthis attractive possibility which motivates this present work. Owing to simple\ngeometry, images from showers at larger core distances tend to have an average angle in the camera which is more displaced from the source position. As\nshown in figure 1b, an image corresponding to a core distance of 500 m would\n3\n\n\fbe displaced by approximately 4 degrees. For point-sources tracked in the center of the field of view, this would require a camera with an angular radius of\n\u223c5 degrees to contain such images. This raises practical concerns regarding\nthe need to balance this with a large enough density of photomultiplier tubes\n(PMTs) to adequately define shower image parameters as well as the potential\nimpact of mirror aberrations on such images. On the other hand, as indicated\nby figure 1c, shower images become elongated by approximately a factor of\ntwo at these larger core distances, which should loosen the constraints related\nto these issues to some extent. Another concern is the need to not only maintain the background rejection capability for large image displacements, but to\nactually improve it, since lower intensity images will now have to \"compete\"\nwith a much larger flux of low energy cosmic-ray background showers (mostly\ndue to protons) which bombard the earth from all angles. Finally, there is the\nquestion of how well the primary gamma-ray energies corresponding to images\nwith large displacements can be reconstructed.\n\n3\n\nSimulated Configuration\n\nIn order to address the issues previously raised, computer simulations were\nused to investigate the \"wide-angle\" concept in the context of a practical instrument. The simulation package used (18) was developed based on the EGS4\n(19) and SHOWERSIM (20) codes. The simulated shower development was\nchecked against various analytic treatments and image characteristics were\ncompared both with results from other simulation packages and with actual\ndata from the Whipple imaging ACT (21). For the purposes of this paper, a\nbaseline telescope configuration was chosen which was similar to that of the\nWhipple ACT (e.g. (22)), which has a well-documented history of performance\ncharacteristics for a variety of different camera designs and, thus, allows for\neasy comparison with this device. Accordingly, the model involved a 10 m\ndiameter Davies-Cotton mirror design at an altitude of 2400 m above sea level\nand wavelength-dependent mirror reflectivity and PMT quantum efficiencies\nsimilar to those measured for the Whipple 10 m ACT. However, a slightly\nlonger f = 1 focal length was used (compared with f = 0.7), which is more\nin line with current telescope designs and reduces some of the optical aberrations at large image displacements. Each PMT was modelled with a light\nconcentrator on the front face, possessing a wavelength-independent reflectivity of 80%. The signal recorded in each channel of electronics per event was\nsimply assumed to consist of the earliest detected photon arrival time and the\nsummed number of photoelectrons (pe) for the corresponding PMT.\n\n4\n\n\fBased on the previous discussion, the nominal camera design simulated was\ntaken to have an angular radius of 5 degrees, or a full field of view angle of\n10 degrees. This is roughly twice the angular diameter of the cameras used for\nthe HESS ACTs (23) and nearly three times those of the VERITAS project\n(24). The cameras for each of these other instruments are composed of an array\nof PMTs which, individually, have a full field of view angle of \u223c0.15 degrees.\nHowever, as indicated earlier, gamma-ray images corresponding to shower\ncores which land a few hundred meters away from the ACT are elongated\nby roughly a factor of two relative to those landing within 100 m (see figure\n1c). Hence, it is reasonable to suspect that PMTs with twice the angular acceptance (i.e. 0.3 degrees) might be appropriate for the approach explored here.\nThis would also keep the number of PMTs to less than 1000 per ACT, which\nis certainly in line with current ACT camera design and couches this study in\nvery practical terms. Consequently, for the purposes of this paper, the nominal\nsimulated camera design consisted of 935 PMTs, each with an angular acceptance of 0.3 degrees, as illustrated in figure 2. Subsequent studies confirmed\nthis PMT density to be sufficient and even suggested it could be somewhat\nreduced without substantial impact (section 6). We have chosen to model a\ncamera with uniform PMT density (as opposed to one with graded spacing) as\nit both simplifies image analysis and provides a more uniform sensitivity for\nsources across the field of view of the instrument. The minimum event trigger\nconditions required at least any two PMTs in the camera to record a signal\nin excess of 20 pe above fluctuations in the night sky background, the latter\nof which was scaled from the recorded data of the Whipple 10 m camera and\ncorresponded to a Gaussian with an RMS of 3 pe for a PMT with a full field\nof view of 0.25\u25e6 (15\u03bcsr).\n\n4\n\nSampling\n\nIn this work, we have concentrated mainly on assessing the performance of the\nhypothetical instrument to point-sources of gamma-rays and have assumed\nsuch a source to be tracked in the center of the field of view of the camera. Table 1 summarises the primary simulation data set used in this work.\nFor simplicity, gamma-ray events have been generated from the zenith, with\nshower cores randomly sampled over an area on ground within 800 m from\nthe detector. Further increase to the effective area for gamma-rays on the order of a factor of \u223c3 (though this is energy-dependent) can be achieved when\nviewing sources at larger zenith angles (25), but the studies here have been\nlimited to what might be achieved relative to the minimum shower 'footprint'\nfrom overhead sources. The largest core distance used was chosen to ensure\nthat the probability of triggering the ACT at the highest gamma-ray energies\nfalls to \u223czero, so that effective areas can be accurately assessed (figure 3a).\n5\n\n\fGamma-rays with energies between 300 GeV and 20 TeV were generated based\non a power-law with a differential spectral index of 2.5, which is indicative of\nmany known TeV sources (e.g. (2), (26), (27)). A smaller sample of 10 fix\nenergies was also generated for the study of image characteristics at those\nparticular energies. Background images were assumed to be predominantly\ndue to primary proton interactions in the atmosphere, which constitute the\nmajority (\u223c75%) of cosmic-ray showers that trigger ACTs in the TeV regime.\nHeavier nuclei are expected to produce shower images which can be rejected\nat least as easily as those from proton primaries. Images from isolated muons\nare not explicitly considered in this study as these tend to be readily identifiable for the energy regime considered here. The simulated proton events were\ngenerated from a power-law with a differential spectral index of 2.7 (28) and\nsampled over the same area on ground as for gamma-ray showers. To insure\na reasonable statistical sample in different energy ranges so as to more accurately characterise the nature of these backgrounds in these regimes, proton\nshowers were generated over several, distinct energy intervals with their contributions appropriately weighted to represent the full spectrum. Cosmic-rays\nare essentially isotropic with respect to the earth, however, in practise, these\nevents can only trigger an ACT within a restricted angular range relative to\nthe telescope orientation. Accordingly, simulated proton-induced background\nshowers were sampled within an angular range of 15 degrees from the telescope\naxis, which was found to be sufficient (see figure 3c).\n\nTo increase the effective statistics, both, gamma-ray and background showers\nwere used 100 times each by sampling the \u010cerenkov photons over different regions on ground. On average, local variations in the shower properties should\nbe relatively uncorrelated. However, within a given shower, all such sampled\ndensities are correlated with the first few interactions of the primary particle,\nwhich determines the height of shower development. Thus, in order to verify\nthat the sampling used did not noticeably bias the results of this study, table\n2 compares the average proton and gamma-ray acceptances for different event\nselection criteria (described below) with the case in which repeated sampling\nof each shower was not used. As can be seen, there is no evidence of any\nbias to within the level of the statistical uncertainties of the test. Therefore,\nrepeated sampling was used for increased statistics in order to better study\nthe differential behaviour of the ACT performance. In cases of low statistics\nin particular parameter regimes, the effect of weighted sampling on the extracted differential behaviour was also directly studied to insure there was no\nsignificant bias due to a handful of heavily-weighted showers.\n6\n\n\f5\n\nImage Analysis\n\nFor those images which triggered the detector, we arbitrarily chose to use the\nsame 2-level image cleaning and image parameterisation approach employed\nby the Whipple group for a camera with a similar individual PMT acceptance (0.25 degrees as opposed to 0.3 degrees) (29). This required a 4.25\u03c3\nsignal above sky noise background for \"picture\" pixels and 2.25\u03c3 for neighbouring \"boundary\" pixels. In addition, to ensure that enough information\nwas available to reconstruct the image parameters reliably, accepted images\nwere required to have at least 5 picture pixels.\nImages were then analysed in terms of moments according to the Hillas prescription (30). The relevant image parameters used in this study were: 1) the\nsummed number of detected photoelectrons in the image, S; 2) the average\nangular displacement in the camera relative to the source position, D; 3) the\nmean length of the image, as measured along its major axis, L; 4) the mean\nwidth of the image, as measured along its minor axis, W; and 5) the angle\nof the major axis with respect to the line linking the image centroid with the\nassumed source position, \u03b1. All of these parameters were couched in units\nof degrees. Figure 4 shows the distributions of these image parameters for\ngamma-ray and background events. In addition, a further image parameter,\nTS , was defined as the slope extracted from a linear fit to the earliest photon arrival time in each PMT as a function of the angular distance of that\nPMT from the assumed source position. This characterises the projection of\ndistances to \u010cerenkov-emitting regions along the axis of shower development,\ngiven the expected primary gamma-ray direction. Figure 5 illustrates the definition of TS for a particular event.\n\n6\n\nDependence on Pixel Size\n\nThe impact of pixel size (PMT density) on ACT sensitivity enters primarily\nthough the ability to characterise image shape and orientation so as to aid\nin background rejection. Consequently, we have explored the ability to reconstruct the parameters L, W and \u03b1 as a function of D for simulated cameras\ncorresponding to pixel sizes of 0.22, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.82 degrees in diameter.\nThese were also compared with values from actual Whipple and VERITAS\ndata for cameras with various pixel sizes over their limited range in D. The\nresults are shown in figure 6. Several characteristics are worth noting: 1) The\nability to determine image orientation (\u03b1) is substantially improved at larger\nimage displacements. 2) The ability to characterise image parameters is noticeably improved for pixel sizes of 0.4\u25e6 compared to 0.8\u25e6 , but any further\nimprovement from using even smaller pixels is relatively modest. This is con7\n\n\fsistent with the findings of Aharonian et al. (31). 3) The fact that very small\npixel sizes even appear to do worse in determining \u03b1 at larger image displacements is an artifact of trigger selection owing to the decreasing photon levels\nin smaller PMTs and the specific trigger requirements assumed. 4) Data from\nactual ACTs seem to have generally larger values of \u03b1 in the angular displacement range of \u223c1\u25e6 than is predicted by the simulation. Once more, this\nappears to be largely due to the field of view and the fact that smaller cameras tend to truncate more of the outer parts of these images. This effect is\nillustrated in figure 7, in which comparisons are made with simulations using\ndifferent fields of view.\nIn addition, the Point Spread Function (PSF) of the detector due to mirror\naberrations, has been calculated as a function of the source offset angle (figure\n8). Figure 9 shows the PSF together with the median length (L) and width\n(W) as a function of the angular displacement (D). The figure indicates that\nthe PSF should not affect the ability to reconstuction the image angular size.\nBased on the above studies, the choice of the 0.3\u25e6 pixel size used to explore\nthe wide-field concept in this current paper would appear to be more than\nadequate. Indeed, it is likely that a camera with even larger pixels could be\nused without significantly affecting the performance of the instrument.\n\n7\n\nSingle Telescope Performance\n\nWe will first consider a single, isolated, wide-angle telescope and assess its\nperformance in terms of background rejection, energy resolution, and effective\narea. Based on this, the sensitivity of the instrument to a hypothetical pointsource will be estimated for both long term (50 hours) and short term (1\nhour) observation periods, which will be compared with that of other ACT\ninstruments.\n\n7.1 Image Selection Criteria\nIn the approach followed here, the goal is to attain good background rejection\nwithout sacrificing collection area for events over a large range of energies\nand core distances from the ACT. These latter properties are most directly\nrelated to the parameters S and D. Figures 10 and 11 show the image parameter distribution as a function of angular displacement (D) for gamma-ray\nand background events respectively. Hence, simulated gamma-ray images were\nfirst categorised into 10 intervals of D (each spanning 0.5\u25e6 ) and 20 logarithmic\nintervals in S (each spanning 0.5 in log10(S)). For each division defined by\n8\n\n\fthe resulting 2-D matrix, symmetric acceptance intervals about the median\nof each of the remaining image parameters were defined so as to arbitrarily\ncontain 95% of the gamma-ray images. Figure 12 illustrates the definition of\nimage selection for events within a given log10(S) interval. The intervals for\nthe parameters L and W define images which have shapes typical of gammaray images, whereas the intervals corresponding to \u03b1 and TS define images\nwhose orientation is characteristic of a primary which came from the assumed\nsource position. In particular, \u03b1 is related to the angular resolution and TS\ncharacterises the extent to which the value of D is due to the displacement\nof the shower core as opposed to a nearby shower with a larger relative inclination angle which, therefore, is not associated with the source. In addition,\nTS was required to be positive in order to remove low energy events landing\nvery near the detector for which the value of TS is poorly defined. Table 2\nshows the efficiency of each one of the acceptance cuts individually applied to\nindependent simulated gamma-ray and proton spectra. From this, it can be\nseen that the introduction of TS yields an extra factor of between 2 and 3 in\nbackground rejection.\n\n7.2 Shower Core and Energy Resolutions\n\nA \u03c72 minimisation method was employed to simultaneously reconstruct the\ncore position and gamma-ray energy of each event so as to explore resolution\nproperties of the hypothetical ACT. This approach also has the advantage of\nbeing trivially extended for use with multiple telescopes, which will be explored\nin section 8. Three image characteristics were used in this fit (see figures 13\nand 14): D, log10 (S) and log10 (TS /D). The factor of D in the latter expression\nremoves the first-order dependence on this parameter and allows the \u03c72 to be\nbetter approximated by a linear sum of independent contributions from each\nof these characteristics. To define the \u03c72 model, simulated gamma-ray events\nwere first categorised into 10 m intervals of core distance and logarithmic\nintervals of primary gamma-ray energy using 4 bins per decade. The model\nwas extended in energy, with respect to our standard data set (table 1), down\nto 30 GeV and up to 55 TeV to reduce reconstruction biases for events near\nthe boundaries of this set. For each division of this 2-D matrix, the median\nvalue of each image characteristic was determined, along with \"equivalent\"\nupper and lower one standard deviation values, defined as those values which\nbound \u00b134% of images about this median. The \u03c72 function was then defined\nas:\n2\n\n\u03c7 \u2261\n\n3\nX\ni=1\n\n\"\n\nmi \u2212 m0i (E, R)\n\u03c3i0 (E, R)\n\n#2\n\n9\n\n\fwhere mi is the measured median value of the ith image characteristic for the\nevent; and m0i (E, R) and \u03c3i0 (E, R) are the model predictions for the median\nand effective standard deviation for this characteristic, respectively, as a function of primary energy, E, and distance from the shower core, R. Appropriate\n\u03c3i0 (E, R) values were used depending on whether the mi was above or below\nm0i (E, R)\nUsing an independent simulated data set (300 GeV-20 TeV) from that used to\ngenerate the model (30 GeV-55 TeV), this \u03c72 was then minimised with respect\nto E and R for each event, using values from the 2-D matrix described above.\nDespite the approximations of independent image characteristics and normal\nerrors, the resulting distribution of \u03c72 , shown in figure 15, is in reasonable\nagreement with the expected 1 degree of freedom. To remove poorly defined\nimages, those events with values of the \u03c72 probabilities less than 10% were\neliminated from the data set as well as those with reconstructed energies\noutside the considered energy range 300 GeV-20 TeV. Together, these cuts\nremove \u223c27% of the gamma-ray events that passed image cuts and \u223c66% of\nproton events. Based on this procedure, figure 16 shows the derived core and\nenergy resolutions as a function of actual primary gamma-ray energy and true\ncore distance from the ACT. For a single telescope, an energy resolution of\n\u223c25% is achieved above 1 TeV, essentially independent of the core distance.\n\n7.3 Effective Areas\n\nThe \"effective area\" for a given class of events was computed as the projected\narea on the ground over which simulated core locations are uniformly sampled\nwith respect to the ACT, times the fraction of such events which are retained\nin the data sample. Figure 17 shows the derived effective areas for gamma-ray\nand proton showers as a function of the true primary energy for triggered\nshowers both before and after image selection. As expected, approximately\n(0.95)4 \u223c80% of gamma-ray images are retained after selection based on the\n4 image parameters. The effective collection area for gamma-rays after this\nselection is \u223c 2\u00d7105 m2 at primary energies of 1 TeV and exceeds \u223c 5\u00d7105 m2\nabove 5 TeV. This is roughly an order of magnitude larger than a conventional,\nsingle telescope and about twice that of the HESS or VERITAS arrays. At\nhigher energies, the relative gain in effective area is even greater.\nFor proton-induced showers, the effective collection areas are suppressed by\nroughly a factor of 103 following image selection. However, it should be noted\nthat background rejection factors cannot be directly implied from these figures\nsince the true primary energy is not an observable. Thus, the resolution of\n\"equivalent\" gamma-ray energies and their effect on assumed background and\nsource spectra must be taken into consideration.\n10\n\n\fThe raw trigger rate from background showers based on an assumed proton\n\u22122 \u22121\nflux of \u03a6p (E) = 8.73 \u00d7 10\u22122 ET\u22122.7\ns sr\u22121 TeV\u22121 (28), is found to be \u223c\neV m\n1 kHz, using the basic trigger scheme assumed here. A simple pattern trigger\ncan further reduce this by a factor of \u223c2 (32), making it easily manageable\nby relatively standard data acquisition electronics (see e.g. (33)).\n\n7.4 Single Telescope Flux Sensitivity\n\nThe image selection and energy reconstruction procedures previously described\nwere applied to simulated proton and gamma-ray spectra sampled from differential power laws of the form E \u22122.7 and E \u22122.5 , respectively. In order to\ncouch the derived quantities in terms of typical detection rates, the simulated spectra were initially normalised according to \u03a6p (E) = 8.73 \u00d7 10\u22122 ET\u22122.7\neV\nm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121 TeV\u22121 , based on cosmic ray primary measurements (28); and\n\u22122 \u22121\nJ\u03b3 (E) = 3.2 \u00d7 10\u22127 ET\u22122.5\ns TeV\u22121 , based on the measured high energy\neV m\nflux from the Crab Nebula near 1 TeV (26). These were then convolved with\nthe relevant effective collection areas and used to yield differential detection\n\u03b3\nrates in terms of the reconstructed, effective gamma-ray energy, ERec\n. These\nare shown in figure 18, for different ranges of D.\nThese figures may be used to derive the detector \"sensitivity\" for such a source\nspectrum by first integrating the rates over a chosen time scale, then scaling the\nassumed gamma-ray flux until a given minimum significance level for detection\nover some defined effective energy range is reached. For the purposes of this\npaper, the sensitivity will be defined based on the integrated signal above\na given effective energy threshold which yields a detection at a significance\nlevel of 5\u03c3 and a minimum of 10 detected high-energy gamma-rays. It will\nalso be assumed that the nominal background rate is well known. In practise,\nuncertainties in this background rate will reduce the significance level to some\nextent, so that the curves derived here may be more indicative of detection\nlevels corresponding to \u223c3-4\u03c3.\nParticularly for this type of camera, background levels will be highly dependent on both the reconstructed gamma-ray energy and the apparent core distance. To account for this, the average signal and background levels were first\ncomputed separately for the 3 regions of D shown in figure 18 (0-2.6\u25e6 , 2.6\u25e6 -3.7\u25e6\nand 3.7\u25e6 -4.5\u25e6) and in each of 8 logarithmic energy intervals between 300 GeV\nand 20 TeV. A maximum likelihood ratio, Lr , was then constructed relative to\nthe zero-signal case. \u22122logLr is approximately distributed as a \u03c72 distribution\n(34), from which the average detection significance was calculated assuming\nthat three variable parameters of signal strength, power-law index and spectral cut-off may be fit to the data. This approach appropriately weights the\ncontributions from the different signal/background regimes.\n11\n\n\f\u03b3\nThe resulting sensitivity curves as a function of ERec\nare shown in figures\n19 and 20 for exposure times of 50 hours and 1 hour, respectively. These\nare compared with similar curves for the Whipple, MAGIC, VERITAS and\nHESS instruments, taken from (24) and (35). To verify the consistency of the\nmethods used to obtain the following results, the sensitivity of the Whipple\ntelescope was also independently estimated for 50 hours exposure time using\nthe same simulation software and similar analysis procedure as employed for\nthe wide-angle camera study. As can be seen in figure 19, the results are in\nexcellent agreement with published values.\n\nFor continuous sources based on 50 hours of exposure, the wide-angle camera\nis found to be approximately a factor of two more sensitive than the Whipple\ninstrument, even at energies as low as 300 GeV. This stems from the fact\nthat, even at these low energies, the collection area for the larger field of\nview is roughly a factor of two larger than the Whipple instrument and the\nTS selection (made more effective by the larger field of view) suppresses the\nbackground by an addition factor of \u223c2. As the sensitivity is proportional to\nthe square root of both these factors, the overall improvement in sensitivity\nby a factor of two is as expected.\nFor this same exposure, the device becomes comparable to VERITAS and\nHESS at energies above 10 TeV, despite backgrounds, owing to the greatly\nincreased collection area. For studies based on 1 hour of exposure (as might\nbe characteristic of transient emission from AGN), the wide-angle camera\nsurpasses the sensitivity of the arrays above 2-3 TeV, despite being only a\nsingle telescope with a \u223c30% smaller mirror area than each element of the\narrays. This is due to the fact that, with it's much larger collection area, the\nwide-angle camera tends to be background dominated rather than statistics\nlimited. Thus, any decrease in the relative background level (whether through\nimproved background rejection or higher source fluxes over shorter exposure\ntimes) results in greater improvement relative to conventional cameras, which\nbecome starved for signal above \u223c1 TeV (as indicated by the upwards turn in\ntheir sensitivity curves in figure 20).\n\n8\n\nTandem Telescope Configuration\n\nBackground rejection is clearly a key factor to instrumental sensitivity. This is\nparticularly true for the wide-field concept, which seeks to extend the dynamic\nrange by essentially swapping a statistically limited regime for one which is\nmore background limited, as previously mentioned. One obvious way to gain\nfurther background rejection and also improved energy resolution is with the\nuse of multiple telescopes. In order to explore the potential gain in sensitivity\nby this approach, we have limited our consideration here to a tandem config12\n\n\furation in which identical wide-field ACTs are separated by 125 m, which is\nclose to the optimum distance suggested by Aharonian et al. based on trigger\nrates (36). However, note that we have not specifically optimised this configuration in terms of background rejection versus effective collection area for the\ninstrument considered here, but have only chosen this as a \"representative\"\nconfiguration to explore the basic characteristics. We have also not optimised\nthe trigger for a 2-telescope system, but have simply imposed the same single\ntelescope trigger and image analysis/rejection previously described to both\ncameras (figure 21). The simulated data set used for this study is summarised\nin table 3. As with the case of protons in the previous study, showers were\ngenerated over several different energy intervals and joined via an appropriate\nweighting to represent full spectra so as to improve the statistical characterisation in very different energy regimes.\n\n8.1 Tandem Shower Core and Energy Resolution\nThe \u03c72 approach for determining primary energy and core location was modified for the 2-telescope case to simultaneously fit both camera images. This\nwas done by fitting for the 2-dimensional core location (as opposed to simply\nradius) and introducing a 4th image characteristic, \u2206\u03a6, which is sensitive to\nthe angular orientation of the core with respect to the coordinates of each telescope. This parameter was defined as the angular deviation between the core\ndirection and the direction of the image centroid, both relative to the centre\nof the particular camera (which is assumed to track the source). This definition is illustrated in figure 22. Thus, the \u03c72 function for the \"jth\" telescope\nbecomes:\n\u03c72j\n\n\u2261\n\n4\nX\ni=1\n\n\"\n\nmi \u2212 m0i (E, R)\n\u03c3i0 (E, R)\n\n#2\n\nwhere the sum is over each of the 4 image parameters. The overall \u03c72 function\nfor an array of n telescopes is therefore:\n\u03c72array\n\n=\n\nn\nX\n\n\u03c72j\n\nj=1\n\nGiven the three free fit parameters (the 2-D core location plus primary gammaray energy), for the case of 2 telescopes (each involving 4 measured characteristics), this should nominally correspond to 5 degrees of freedom. However,\nthis once more assumes that the image characteristics are completely uncorrelated and that the uncertainties are normally distributed, neither of which\n13\n\n\fis strictly true. The actual \u03c72 distribution is compared with the idealised case\nin figure 23.\nIn applying this fitting procedure to simulated data, as in the case of a single\ntelescope, events with values of D greater than 4.5\u25e6 or fit \u03c72 values less than\n10% likely were eliminated from the data set in order to remove poorly defined\nimages. Figure 24 shows the derived core and energy resolutions as a function\nof actual primary gamma-ray energy and true core distance from the ACT.\nAn energy resolution of \u223c20% is achieved, as compared to the single telescope\nvalue of \u223c25%.\n\n8.2 Inter-Telescope Timing and Shower Maximum\n\nThe relative arrival times of the \u010cerenkov signal in different telescopes can\nalso provide valuable information. The thickness of the \u010cerenkov wavefront\nfrom an extensive air shower is expected to be \u223c5-10 ns and the DaviesCotton design considered here results in light paths to the camera which differ\nby as much as 5 ns. However, a typical gamma-ray image involves several\nhundred photoelectrons, such that the statistical sampling should allow a subnanosecond measurement of the relative wavefront arrival time. For an array\nof telescopes spread over a baseline of \u223c100-200 m, this alone could provide\na determination of the shower arrival direction with an accuracy comparable\nto or better than that based on image orientation. However, even for the case\nof two telescopes explored here, the relative arrival times of the \u010cerenkov\nsignal can be combined with the reconstructed shower core position to yield\ninformation on the height of shower maximum and also provide another useful\ndiscriminant against background showers.\nIn particular, if it is assumed that the \u010cerenkov light is emitted from a height of\nmaximum shower development, hmax , above the detector level, for the simple\ncase here in which the source is at zenith, the time at which the telescope\nreceives the light is then just given by:\nt=\n\nnq 2\nhmax + R2\nc\n\nwhere n is the refractive index of air and R is the distance from that telescope\nto the shower core at the detection level. Thus, in the limit where hmax \u226b R\nand n = 1.0, the difference in time between two different telescope measurements is given by:\n\u2206t \u2243\n\n1\n(R2 \u2212 R12 )\n2chmax 2\n14\n\n\fThus, a plot of \u2206t versus (R22 \u2212 R12 ) should yield a well-defined linear relation\nfor gamma-rays, whose slope is proportional to the height of shower maximum\n(figure 25). In practise, the lateral extent of the gamma-ray shower at the point\nof maximum development means that much of the light arrives from distances\nsomewhat closer to the detector than is implied by the shower core. This\ncauses the apparent hmax derived from the simplistic expression above to be\noverestimated. In order to apply this to a simulated data set, the reconstructed\ncore locations were used (as previously described) and the relative \"image\ntime\" in each telescope was defined as that of the image centroid, using the\nlinear fit parameters derived in the determination of TS . Results are shown in\nfigure 25 for a simulated gamma-ray source.\nA selection criteria based on this to discriminate against background was\nformed by defining a range of \u2206t as a function of (R22 \u2212 R12 ) which contains\n95% of the gamma-rays. This was found to reject \u223c85% of proton events which\nwould otherwise pass data selection.\n\n8.3 Factorised Background Rejection\n\nThe very large background rejection associated with a multi-telescope system\ncan impose statistical limitations on the ability to extract detailed information about the behaviour of the expected background from a finite set of\nsimulations. However, many of the image selection criteria are independent\nof each other to a very large extent, thus allowing their individual effects to\nbe well determined and then combined as a product. To explicitly verify this\napproach for the current case, we first consider the background rejection of a\nsingle camera for proton events which have triggered both telescopes and pass\nthe selections D < 4.5\u25e6 , TS > 0 and npicture \u2265 5. Table 5 shows the fraction\nof such events which pass different data selection criteria, both individually\nand in various combinations. These numbers indicate that selections based on\n1) image shape (L and W), 2) image orientation \u03b1, and 3) hmax , based on\nrelative image times (in this case making use of information from the second\ntelescope), are all largely independent of each other.\nWe now consider these data selection criteria applied to the case of two telescopes. While the effect of any given selection is generally correlated between\nboth cameras, the joint application of each selection will still be independent\nfrom the joint application of another selection. Table 6 lists the two-telescope\nproton rejection factors for each the three selections listed above.\nFurthermore, the effect of a selection based on the \u03c72 goodness of fit to the\ngamma-ray energy and core location can also be separately applied as a factor\nsince the parameters involved (S, D and TS ) are independent of the three\n15\n\n\fselections above: Image shape and orientation selections are parameterised as\na function of S and D to explicitly remove any dependence, while the relative\nimage times are, by construction, independent of individual telescope time\nmeasurements. For the case of two telescopes, a \u03c72 selection chosen to keep\n90% of gamma-ray images was found to reject \u223c85% of proton shower images.\nThe combination of these factors for the case of two-telescope analysis is shown\nin table 6 for 2 different ranges of reconstructed gamma-ray energy. As no clear\ndependence on this reconstructed energy is seen, a single, average rejection\nfactor will be applied to scale the detection rates from the one telescope to\nthe two telescope case.\n\n8.4 Tandem Telescope Sensitivity\nFollowing a similar procedure to that employed for a single telescope, figures\n19 and 20 show the sensitivity of a tandem, wide-angle instrument to a hypothetical point-source with an E \u22122.5 differential spectrum, both for 50 hours\nand 1 hour exposure times, respectively. This is compared with similar curves\nfor the VERITAS/HESS instruments. The scaling relative to the single telescope case is consistent with the factor expected from comparing the Whipple\nwith the VERITAS/HESS sensitivities (24) (figure 19), with an additional\nfactor of \u223c2 gained from the hmax selection. For the 50 hour exposure, the\nsensitivity of the tandem wide-angle design is a factor of \u223c4 times more sensitive over the range above 300 GeV, with extended sensitivity above 10 TeV.\nFor the case of 1 hour exposure, the sensitivities are comparable at 300 GeV\nand exceed an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity above 5 TeV.\n\n9\n\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nThe study presented here suggests that the sensitivity of ACT instruments\ncould be substantially improved in the regime above 300 GeV through the use\nof cameras with much larger fields of view for the same PMT density than are\ncurrently employed. Particularly for the tandem telescope design considered in\nthis paper, the ability to image showers further \"off-axis\" leads to a significant\ngain in effective area with no significant loss in energy resolution compared\nwith current instruments, even for showers with cores landing much further\nfrom the telescopes. The ability to suppress background events also appears\nto be substantial for such a design and yields a very good sensitivity over a\nremarkably large dynamic range. This background rejection has been enhanced\nby the introduction of additional imaging parameters based on both intraand inter- telescope timing characteristics. These parameters may be of some\n16\n\n\fuse even for current instruments, though they are particularly well suited for\ncameras with larger fields of view.\nTo be explicit, the conclusions of this study rely on four basic premises: 1)\nThat the simulations are accurate and that the analysis techniques applied\nare valid. In this regard we have verified the simulation by comparing with\nanalytical calculations, alternative simulations and actual experimental data.\nWe have been able to reproduce trends seen in other, independent studies and\nreplicate parameter distributions and published sensitivity curves from existing experiments. 2) That the repeated sampling of showers employed does\nnot lead to significant biases. To this end, we have explicitly tested this with\nregard to image selection (Table 2) and have found no evidence of any bias to\nwithin the limits our statistical uncertainties. Furthermore, throughout this\nanalysis, we have specifically checked to insure that resulting distributions\nwere not unduly influenced by a handful of independent showers with unusually high \"weights.\" 3) That the background rejection factor for the tandem\nWFOV design can be factorised into groups of largely independent contributions which can be separately assessed and combined as a product. However,\nin addition for there being logical arguments for why this ought to be the case\nfor the parameters used, we have also explicitly verified the independence of\nthese parameters to within the limits of our statistical uncertainties (Table 5).\n4) That the predicted rejection factors due to newly introduced timing parameters are accurate, even though this is yet to be experimentally tested. We\nfind no reason to doubt these factors given that the photon timing is largely\ngoverned by basic air-shower development and geometry, though we certainly\nencourage future experimental efforts to explicitly explore this. Consequently,\nwe believe the basic results of this study to be robust.\nThese results predict the 2-telescope design considered here to be more than\n\u223c3 times more sensitive than existing/planned arrays in the regime above\n300 GeV for continuously emitting sources; up to \u223c10 times more sensitive for\nhour-scale emission (relevant for episodic sources, such as AGN); significantly\nmore sensitive in the regime above 10 TeV; and possessing a sky coverage which\nis roughly an order of magnitude larger than existing instruments. This is\ndespite the fact that the overall mirror area for the instrument modelled here is\nnearly three times smaller than that of either the current HESS or VERITAS4 designs. This study also suggests that the approach could be extended even\nfurther by using larger fields of view, mirror areas more comparable to the\ncurrent devices and a more optimised array configuration to both increase the\neffective area further and potentially take better advantage of inter-telescope\ntiming so as to improve the angular resolution, even at lower energies. These\nlatter issues will be explored in a future paper.\nThis research has been supported by the Particle Physics and Astronomy\nResearch Council (PPARC).\n\n17\n\n\fReferences\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n[22]\n[23]\n[24]\n[25]\n[26]\n[27]\n[28]\n[29]\n[30]\n[31]\n[32]\n[33]\n[34]\n[35]\n[36]\n\nWeekes, T.
