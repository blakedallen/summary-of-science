We realize this objective by considering an absolutely continuous\npath A(t), a \u2264 t \u2264 b, with given endpoints (say A(a) = A and A(b) = B)\nwhich minimizes its condition length defined by\nZ b\ndA(t)\n\u03c3n (A(t))\u22121 dt.\nL\u03ba =\ndt\na\nF\n2\n\n\fWe call minimizing condition path an absolutely continuous path which\nminimizes this integral in the set of absolutely continuous paths with the same\nend-points.

This concept of geodesic is related to the\nRiemannian structure defined on GLn,m by:\nhM, N i\u03ba,A = \u03c3n (A)\u22122 Re hM, N iF .\nWe call it the condition Riemann structure on GLn,m .\nOur objective is to investigate the properties of the smallest singular value\n\u03c3n (A(t)) along a condition geodesic. Our main result says:\nTheorem 1. For any condition geodesic t \u2192 A(t) in GLn,m , the map t \u2192\nlog (\u03c3n\u22122 (A(t))) is convex.\nThis theorem extends our main result in [2]. In that paper, the same\ntheorem is proven for those condition geodesic arcs contained in the open\nsubset\nGL>\nn,m = {A \u2208 GLn,m : \u03c3n\u22121 (A) > \u03c3n (A)}\nthat is when the smallest singular value \u03c3n (A) is simple. The reason for this\nrestriction is easy to explain. The smallest singular value \u03c3n (A) is smooth in\nGL>\nn,m , and, in that case, we can use the toolbox of Riemannian geometry.\nBut it is only locally Lipschitz in GLn,m ; for this reason we call the condition\nstructure in GLn,m a Lipschitz-Riemannian structure.\nMotivation: Let us now say a word about our motivations. The today\nclassical papers [28], [29], and [30] by Shub and Smale relate complexity\nbounds for homotopy methods to solve polynomial systems to the condition\nnumber of the encountered problems along the considered homotopy path.\nIll-conditioned problems slow the algorithm and increase its complexity. For\nthis reason it is natural to consider paths which avoid ill-posed problems, and,\nat the same time, are as short as possible. The condition metric has been\ndesigned to construct such paths. It has been introduced by Shub in [27],\n3\n\n\fthen studied by Beltr\u00e1n and Shub in [4] in spaces of polynomial equations\n(see also [12, 3, 22].) When we started to work in this project, we expected\nto reduce the more general problem of finding good homotopy paths for nonlinear systems to the 'linear' case. Unfortunately this seems to be a harder\nproblem, to be pursued later.\nThe case of linear maps (and related spaces) appears in Beltr\u00e1n-DedieuMalajovich-Shub [2] and Boito-Dedieu [7].\nIn the linear case, it is rather a remarkable fact that the inverse of the\nsquared distance to singular matrices \u03c3n\u22122 (A(t)) is log-convex along the condition geodesics. So, in particular, the maximum of log (\u03c3n (A(t))\u22122 ) and\nthe maximum of \u03c3n (A(t))\u22121 along such paths is necessarily obtained at its\nendpoints and the condition geodesics stay away from singular matrices.\nThis is clearly not true in the usual metric, since straight lines can get\narbitrarily close to the variety of degenerate matrices. This suggests the\nfollowing application:\nIf we consider a \u221a\ncondition path connecting a given A \u2208 GLn,m to (for\nexample) In,m kAkF / n (In,m (i, j) = 1 if i = j and 0 otherwise), for any\nmatrix A(t) in this path, according to Theorem 1, one has\n\u221a\nn\n\u2264 \u03c3n (A(t))\u22121 \u2264 \u03c3n (A)\u22121 .\nkAkF\nWe think this property may help to find good preconditioners to solve linear\nsystems.\nThere are other motivations. Convexity of the distance or similar function to the ill-posed problems may play a role in optimization. Witness for\nexample the role played by the barrier function in linear programming theory.\nTwo of us will be expanding on this theme in a forthcoming paper.\nOutline of the paper\nThe condition number is not of class C 1 , hence we cannot apply the usual\nRiemannian geometry to the condition metric. In Section 2, we introduce\nLipschitz- Riemann structures and develop the basic results, that allow us to\ndo differential geometry in the non-smooth case. Using nonsmooth analysis\ntechniques, we prove that any condition geodesic is C 1 with a locally Lipschitz\nderivative (Theorem 3). Such techniques are already present in Boito-Dedieu\n[7].\nIn Section 3 we develop an important tool for proving self-convexity, allowing a more systematic use of the symmetries. (A symmetry is an isometry\n4\n\n\fof a manifold that leaves a function invariant). Theorem 12 gives a simplified\ncomputation of the Hessian when there is a Lie group of symmetries. This\ntheorem may be of independent interest. It is so natural we would not be\nsurprised if it is already known, but we have not found it anywhere. We\nwere led to this theorem sometime after a conversation with John Lott on\nHessians and Riemannian submersions while he was visiting the University\nof Toronto.\nThe strategy for proving the main theorem is to decompose the space of\nmatrices in a finite union of smooth manifolds, so that in each of them the\nmetric is smooth. In Section 4 we produce this decomposition, we study the\ngroup of symmetries of the condition number and then, using Theorem 12,\nwe establish self-convexity on each piece.\nIn Section 5, we prove a result that may be of independent interest, Theorem 29: piecing together convexity results on restrictions of the LipschitzRiemann structure to a union of submanifolds of varying dimensions, where\nthe structure is smooth, to obtain a global result.\nIn Section 6, we use all these tools to finish the proof of Theorem 1.\nWe use the same tools in Section 7 to state and prove Theorem 31 about\nself-convexity in the solution variety\nW = {(A, x) \u2208 GLn,n+1 \u00d7 P(Kn ) : Ax = 0} .\nAbove, the notation P(E) denotes the projectivization of a linear space E.\nNamely, it is the space (manifold) of real or complex lines in E passing\nthrough the origin. For instance, P(R3 ) is the classical projective plane, that\ncan also be obtained by identifying antipodal points of the sphere S2 .\nAcknowledgements. We have benefited greatly from conversations with\nour colleagues Charles Pugh and Vitaly Kapovitch about Lipschitz-Riemann\nstructures, especially those conformally equivalent to smooth structures by\nlocally Lipschitz scaling maps.\nSome of this work was accomplished when we met not only in our intitutions, but also at the Institut de Matem\u00e0tica de la Universitat de Barcelona\nand at the Thematic Program in the Foundations of Computational Mathematics (FoCM) at the Fields Institute. We thank these institutions. Also,\nwe would like to thank an anonymous referee for many helpful comments.\n\n5\n\n\f2\n2.1\n\nGeodesics in Lipschitz-Riemann structures,\nand self-convexity\nLipschitz-Riemann structures\n\nMost textbooks of Riemannian geometry define a Riemannian structure on\na smooth manifold M as a scalar product h*, *ix on each tangent space Tx M,\ndepending smoothly on x. Here we drop the smoothness hypothesis.\nDefinition 2. A Lipschitz-Riemann structure on a C 2 manifold M is\na scalar product h*, *ix at each Tx M, suchpthat its coefficients are locally\nLipschitz functions of x. Also, let kukx = hu, uix be the associated norm\nin Tx M.\nThe length of an absolutely continuous path x(t) \u2208 M, a \u2264 t \u2264 b, is\ndefined as the integral\nZ b\nL(x, a, b) =\nk\u1e8b(\u03c4 )kx(\u03c4 ) d\u03c4,\na\n\nwhere \u1e8b(t) denotes the derivative with respect to t. Its arc length is given\nby the map\nt \u2208 [a, b] \u2192 L(x, a, t) \u2208 [0, L(x, a, b)].\nThe distance d(a, b) between two points a, b \u2208 M is the infimum of all the\nlengths of the paths containing a and b in their image. We call minimizing\npath an absolutely continuous path such that L(x, a, b) = d(a, b).\nIt is usual in differential geometry textbooks to construct geodesics as\nsolutions of a certain second order differential equation, the geodesic differential equation. Unfortunately, the coefficients of this equation are given by\na formula in terms of the partial derivatives of the metric coefficients. In a\nLipschitz-Riemann structure, those coefficients are assumed to be Lipschitz,\nnot necessarily differentiable functions. Also, it turns out that minimizing\npaths are not necessarily smooth.\nWe define a minimizing geodesic as a minimizing path parametrized\nby arc length, that is when\nk\u1e8b(t)kx(t) = 1 a. e.\nA path in M parametrized by arc length is a geodesic when it is locally a\nminimizing geodesic.\nThe main result of this section is the following:\n6\n\n\fTheorem 3. Any geodesic for a Lipschitz-Riemann structure belongs to the\nclass C 1+Lip that is C 1 with a locally Lipschitz derivative.\nThis theorem is proved in section 2.4, it extends a similar result by Charles\nPugh [24] who proves the existence of locally minimizing C 1+Lip geodesics.\nHis argument is based on a smooth approximation of the Lipschitz structure\nwhere the classical toolbox of Riemannian geometry applies, followed by a\npassage \u00e0 la limite.\nUsing different techniques we prove here this regularity assumption for\nall geodesics.\nAn immediate consequence of [8, Cor .VIII-4 p.126] is that C 1+Lip = W 2,\u221e\nthe Sobolev space of maps f with f 00 \u2208 L\u221e .\n\n2.2\n\nExistence of geodesics in a Lipschitz-Riemann structure\n\nExistence of minimizing geodesics with given endpoints may be deduced from\nthe Hopf-Rinow Theorem. Because we cannot assume the smoothness of\ngeodesics, we refer to Gromov's version of this theorem [18, Th.1.10]. A\nmetric space (X, d) is a path metric space if the distance between each\npair of points equals the infimum of the lengths of curves joining the points.\nTheorem 4. If (X, d) is a complete, locally compact path metric space, then\n\u2022 Each bounded, closed subset is compact,\n\u2022 Each pair of points can be joined by a minimizing geodesic.\nTwo examples of such spaces are given by Boito-Dedieu [7] for linear maps\n(X is one of the connected components of GLn,m equipped with the condition structure), and by Shub [27] when X is the solution variety associated\nwith the homogeneous polynomial system solving problem equipped with the\ncorresponding condition structure.\n\n2.3\n\nLipschitz-Riemann structures in Rk , generalized gradients and the problem of Bolza\n\nAn important example of Lipschitz-Riemann structure is given by an open\nset \u03a9 \u2282 Rk equipped with the scalar product\nhu, vix = v T H(x)u\n7\n\n\fwhere H is a locally Lipschitz map from \u03a9 into the set of positive definite\nn \u00d7 n matrices.\nA minimizing geodesic x(t) \u2208 \u03a9, a \u2264 t \u2264 b, minimizes the integral\nZ bp\n\u1e8f(t)T H(y(t))\u1e8f(t)dt\na\n\nin the set of absolutely continuous paths y(t) with endpoints y(a) = x(a),\nand y(b) = x(b).

For this reason we\nreplace the classical geodesic differential equation by a generalized version of\nthe Euler-Lagrange equation (2.2) based on generalized gradients.\nLet f : \u03a9 \u2282 Rk \u2192 R be a locally Lipschitz function defined on an open\nset.

Let x solve the Bolza problem (2.1) in the case in which L(x, \u1e8b)\nis a locally Lipschitz map and suppose that \u1e8b is essentially bounded. Then\nthere is an absolutely continuous map p such that\n\u1e57(t) \u2208 \u2202x L(x(t), \u1e8b(t)) and p(t) \u2208 \u2202\u1e8b L(x(t), \u1e8b(t)) a.e.\n\n2.4\n\nProof of Theorem 3\n\nSince Theorem 3 is of local nature, it suffices to prove it locally in Rk . Once\nthis is done, take a local chart and transfer the Lipschitz-Riemann structure\nof M to an open set \u03a9 \u2282 Rk where the theorem is already proved. Therefore,\nlet us show the theorem in Rk .\nBy definition, a geodesic is a locally minimizing geodesic. Thus, it suffices\nto establish the theorem in this case.\nA minimizing geodesic x(t) \u2208 \u03a9, a \u2264 t \u2264 b, is parametrized by arc length\nso that\n\u1e8b(t)T H(x(t))\u1e8b(t) = 1 a.e.,\n9\n\n\fThus, \u1e8b(t) is 6= 0 and essentially bounded:\n\u0001\n\u1e8b \u2208 L\u221e [a, b], Rk .\nMoreover, x minimizes the integral\nZ bp\n\u1e8f(t)T H(y(t))\u1e8f(t)dt\na\n\nin the set of absolutely continuous paths with endpoints y(a) = x(a), and\ny(b) = x(b). Thus, according to Theorem 5, there is an absolutely continuous\narc p such that\np\n\u1e57(t) \u2208 \u2202x \u1e8b(t)T H(x(t))\u1e8b(t),\n(2.3)\np\np(t) \u2208 \u2202\u1e8b \u1e8b(t)T H(x(t))\u1e8b(t)\n(2.4)\nfor almost all t \u2208 [a, b]. Since our integrand is smooth in the \u1e8b variable we\nmay write (2.4)\nH(x(t))\u1e8b(t)\np(t) = p\n= H(x(t))\u1e8b(t).\n\u1e8b(t)T H(x(t))\u1e8b(t)\nThus, \u1e8b(t) = H(x(t))\u22121 p(t) is absolutely continuous and x(t) possesses a.e.\na second derivative \u1e8d(t) \u2208 L1 ([a, b], Rk ).\nWe now have to show that\n\u221a this second derivative is essentially bounded.\nThis comes from (2.3). Since * is a smooth function we get from Proposition\n2.3.3 and Theorem 2.3.9 of Clarke's book [11] that\n\u2202x\n\np\n\u1e8bT \u2202H(x)\u1e8b\n1\n\u1e8bT H(x)\u1e8b \u2282 p\n= \u1e8bT \u2202H(x)\u1e8b,\n2\n2 \u1e8bT H(x)\u1e8b\n\nwith\n\u1e8bT \u2202H(x)\u1e8b =\n\nX\n\n\u1e8bi \u1e8bj \u2202hij (x).\n\ni,j\n\nEquation (2.3) implies\n1\n\u1e57(t) \u2208 \u1e8b(t)T \u2202H(x(t))\u1e8b(t) a.e.\n2\nFrom the hypothesis, the functions hij (x) are locally Lipschitz. Their generalized gradients are compact convex sets in Rk . The union of all these sets\n10\n\n\falong the path x(t) gives us a bounded set. Since the curve \u1e8b(t) is continuous,\nwe deduce from these considerations, that \u1e57(t) is bounded a.e. Thus p(t) is\nLipschitz, and \u1e8b(t) = H(x(t))\u22121 p(t) is also Lipschitz. The second derivative\n\u1e8d(t) is thus bounded by the Lipschitz constant of \u1e8b(t), and we are done.\nRemark 6. The previous lines give the following properties for a geodesic x\nin \u03a9: x \u2208 C 1+Lip , \u1e8bT H(x)\u1e8b = 1, and\nd\n1\n1X\n(H(x)\u1e8b) \u2208 \u1e8bT \u2202H(x)\u1e8b =\n\u1e8bi \u1e8bj \u2202hij (x) a.e.\ndt\n2\n2 i,j\nThe initial value problem, and even the boundary value problem associated\nwith this second order differential inclusion, may have many solutions. Examples are given in [7]. Moreover, solutions are not necessarily locally minimizing geodesics and geodesics are not necessarily unique.\n\n2.5\n\nConformal Lipschitz-Riemann structure\n\nThe example of a Lipschitz-Riemann structure which motivates this paper is\ngiven by the condition structure on GLn,m . It is obtained in multiplying the\nFrobenius scalar product by the locally Lipschitz function \u03c3n\u22122 . Let us put it\nin a more general setting.\nDefinition 7. Let (M, h*, *i) be a C 2 Riemannian manifold, and let \u03b1 :\nM \u2192 R be a locally Lipschitz function with positive values. Let M\u03ba be the\nmanifold M with the new metric\nh*, *i\u03ba,x = \u03b1(x)h*, *ix\ncalled \u03b1-Riemann structure. When \u03b1 is the square of the (unscaled) condition number, i.e. \u03b1(A) = kA\u2020 k22 = \u03c3n\u22122 , this is also called the condition\nRiemann structure or simply the condition structure. We say that \u03b1 is\nself-convex when log \u03b1(\u03b3(t)) is convex for any geodesic \u03b3 in M\u03ba .\nWe denote by L (respectively L\u03ba ) the length of a curve \u03b3 in the Mstructure (respectively in the M\u03ba -structure). We will speak of length or\ncondition length, and also of distance or condition distance, geodesics\nor condition geodesics and so on.\nExamples of self-convex maps are given in [2] where this concept is introduced for the first time.\nUsing this definition Theorem 1 above reads\n\u03b1(A) = \u03c3n (A)\u22122 is self-convex in GLn,m .\n11\n\n\f3\n3.1\n\nSelf-convexity in the smooth case and the\ncomputation of Hessians.\nSelf-convexity in the smooth case\n\nSelf convexity in the smooth case was studied in our previous paper [2] in\nthis journal. We refer the reader to Section 2 of [2] for basic definitions\nregarding convexity and geodesic convexity. A snapshot of the main features\nof self-convexity in the smooth case follows.\nWe denote by D the Levi-Civita connection and by DX T the covariant\nderivative of a tensor T in the direction given by a vector field X. Recall\nthat if we assume geodesic coordinates in the neighborhood of a point p,\nthen (DX T )p is the same as the ordinary directional (or Lie) derivative. The\ncovariant derivative is coordinate independent, in the sense that DX T is a\ntensor.\nIf f is a smooth enough function, then its derivative with respect to a vector field is denoted by X(f ), so that X(f )(p) = Df (p)X(p) = h\u2207f (p), X(p)ip .\nThe second covariant derivative of a function f (sometimes also known as\nthe Hessian) is defined by\nD2 f (X, Y ) = D(Df )(X, Y ) = DX (Y (f )) \u2212 (DX Y )(f )\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere X and Y are smooth vector fields. The operator above is symmetric,\nin the sense that D2 f (X, Y ) = D2 f (Y, X) (see e.g. [5, p.305])\nWhen \u03b1 : M \u2192 R is C 2 , self-convexity of \u03b1 is equivalent to the second\ncovariant derivative of log(\u03b1) being positive semi-definite in the \u03b1-condition\nRiemann structure (see [32] Chap. 3, Theorem 6.2). Note that the second\ncovariant derivative of a map M \u2192 R is different in M and in M\u03ba . We\ndenote them respectively by D2 or D\u03ba2 . Self-convexity of \u03b1 is equivalent to\nD\u03ba2 log(\u03b1) being positive semi-definite.\nProposition 2 of [2] is\nProposition 8. For a function \u03b1 : M \u2192 R of class C 2 with positive values\nself-convexity is equivalent to\n2\u03b1(x)D2 \u03b1(x)(\u1e8b, \u1e8b) + kD\u03b1(x)k2x k\u1e8bk2x \u2212 4(D\u03b1(x)\u1e8b)2 \u2265 0\nfor all x \u2208 M and for all vector \u1e8b \u2208 Tx M, the tangent space at x.\n12\n\n(3.2)\n\n\f3.2\n\nSelf-convexity in a product space\n\nProposition 2 of [2] has an immediate corollary which can be useful. Suppose\nN is another C 2 Riemannian manifold. Give M \u00d7 N the product metric. Let\n\u03c0 : M \u00d7 N \u2192 M be the projection on the first factor and \u03b1\u0302 : M \u00d7 N \u2192 R\nbe the composition \u03b1\u0302 = \u03b1 \u25e6 \u03c0.\nProposition 9. Let \u03b1 be of class C 2 in M. Then, \u03b1 is self-convex in M if\nand only if \u03b1\u0302 is self-convex in M \u00d7 N .\nWe thank an anonymous referee for pointing out the if part of this Proposition and simplifying the proof.\nProof. We prove first the only if part. Let (x, y) \u2208 M \u00d7 N and assume\nnormal (geodesic) coordinates in a neighborhood of x \u2208 M. Also, assume\nnormal coordinates around y \u2208 N with respect to the inner product h*, *iN .\nWe claim that this defines a system of normal coordinates in M\u00d7N . This\ncan be seen from the fact that the exponential map in a product manifold\nM \u00d7 N is the partitionning of the exponential mappings of M and N .\nHowever, we give a direct proof below.\nLet gij and \u0393kij denote respectively the coefficients of the first fundamental\nform h*, *ix,y and the Christoffel symbols. By construction, gij (x, y) = \u03b4ij .\nAlso, it is easy to see that for all indexes i, j, k,\n\u0393kij (x, y) = 0 .\nIndeed, if indices (i, j, k) correspond to the same component M or N this\nfollows from the choice of normal coordinates in each component. Otherwise,\nsay that i, j correspond to coordinates in M and k to coordinates in N . Then\ngik \u2261 gjk \u2261 0 and furthermore,\n\u2202\ngij (x, y) = 0.\n\u2202uk\nThus \u0393ikj (x, y) = 0 for all indexes i, j, k. This implies that \u0393kij (x, y) = 0 as\nwell. Thus we have a normal system of coordinates around (x, y) \u2208 M \u00d7 N .\nIn that system of coordinates,\n2\nDM\u00d7N\n\u03b1\u0302(x, y)\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n2\nDN\n\u03b1(x) 0\n=\n0\n0\n13\n\n\fFrom the block structure of the second covariant derivative above, it is clear\n2\n2\nthat DM\u00d7N\n\u03b1\u0302(x, y) is positive semi-definite if and only if DN\n\u03b1(x) is positive\ndefinite.\nWe have raised the question in the introduction of whether self-convexity\nof the condition number holds for the condition Riemann structure on the\nsolution variety considered in [27]. The theorems proven in this paper apply\nto the case of linear systems, but with the use of Proposition 9 they give us\nsome information on polynomial systems almost for free.\nLet d = (d1 , . . . , dn ). Consider the vector space\nPd,0 = {(f1 , . . . , fn ) : fi \u2208 C[x1 , . . . , xn ] with deg fi = di and fi (0) = 0}.\nAn important point is that self-convexity is well-defined for Riemannian\nmanifolds. Therefore, if we want to speak of self-convexity in Pd,0 , we need\nto make it into an inner product vector space. We will follow [6] and assume\nthe unitarily invariant metric in the space of degree di polynomials. This is\nthe same as the metric for symmetric di -tensors.

Immediate from Proposition 9 and Theorem 1.\n\n3.3\n\nComputation of the Hessian\n\nWhen analyzing the convexity properties of \u03c3n (A), we first note that this\nfunction is invariant through unitary changes of coordinates, namely\n\u03c3n (A) = \u03c3n (U AV \u2217 )\nfor unitary matrices U \u2208 Un , and V \u2208 Um (resp. orthogonal matrices U \u2208\nOn , and V \u2208 Om ). Let us consider this situation in a general framework.\nA Lie group is a group that is also a smooth manifold, and such that\nthe group operations (multiplication and inversion) are smooth. We say that\na Lie group G acts (smoothly) on a manifold M if there is a smooth map\n` : G \u00d7 M \u2192 M with\n`((g1 g2 ), p) = `(g1 , `(g2 , p)) and `(1, p) = p .\nIn the example above, G = Un \u00d7 Um acts on GLn,m by `((U, V ), p) = U pV \u2217 .\nFor simplicity, we may write g(p) for `(g, p) and assimilate g to the mapping\np \u2192 g(p) = `(g, p).\nAn isometry of M is a diffeomorphism of M that preserves Riemannian\ndistance. We say that the Lie group G acts by isometries when for all g, the\ncorresponding map g : p \u2192 g(p) is an isometry of M.\n15\n\n\fDefinition 11. Let \u03b1 : M \u2192 R. A group of symmetries of \u03b1 is a Lie\ngroup, acting smoothly by isometries on M, and leaving \u03b1 invariant (that\nis, \u03b1(g(p)) = \u03b1(p) for all g \u2208 G and p \u2208 M.\nLet 1 be the unit of the group G. We will denote by g the Lie algebra\nof G and by exp : g ' T1 G \u2192 G the exponential function (See, for instance,\n[20]). For instance, if G = Un , then 1 is the n \u00d7 n identity matrix, and g is\nthe algebra of skew-Hermitian matrices.

The\norbit G(p) is a manifold [20, Cor 2.19]. If the group G is compact, the orbit\nis then an embedded submanifold of M. In any case, Tp G(p) will denote the\ntangent space of the orbit G(p) at p, as a subspace of Tp M.

As \u03b1 is G-invariant,\nK(\u03b1) = hK, grad \u03b1i = 0.\n17\n\n(3.6)\n\n\fMoreover, the one-parameter group generated by K consists of global isometries, thus K is a Killing vector field, which implies that for any pair of vector\nfields X, Y ,\nhDY K, Xi + hDX K, Y i = 0, or equivalently using (3.5)\nK(hY, Xi) + h[Y, K], Xi + h[X, K], Y i = 0.\nWe can now compute\n2D2 \u03b1(X, K) = 2X(K(\u03b1)) \u2212 2(DX K)(\u03b1) = \u22122hDX K, grad \u03b1i =\n\u2212X(hK, grad \u03b1i) \u2212 K(hX, grad \u03b1i) + grad \u03b1(hX, Ki)\n\u2212h[X, K], grad \u03b1i \u2212 h[grad \u03b1, X], Ki + h[K, grad \u03b1], Xi.\nFrom (3.7) we know that\n\u2212K(hX, grad \u03b1i) \u2212 h[X, K], grad \u03b1i + h[K, grad \u03b1], Xi = 0.\nUsing hgrad \u03b1, Ki = 0, we conclude\n2D2 \u03b1(X, K) = grad \u03b1(hX, Ki) \u2212 h[grad \u03b1, X], Ki,\nwhich proves the first assertion.\nWhen X = K, the second term above vanishes: using (3.3),\nh[K, grad \u03b1], Ki =\n=\n=\n=\n\nhDK grad \u03b1, Ki \u2212 hDgrad \u03b1 K, Ki\nhDK grad \u03b1, Ki + hgrad \u03b1, DK Ki\nK(hK, grad \u03b1i)\n0.\n\nEquation (3.4) follows.\nLemma 14.\n2D2 \u03b1(p)(k, b) = grad \u03b1(hB, Ki)(p).\n\n18\n\n(3.7)\n\n\fProof. By continuity of the formulas in the lemma, we can assume that k 6= 0\nand that b, grad \u03b1(p) are lineary independent. Let N0 be a codimension\n2 submanifold of M with p in its interior. Assume that b \u2208 Tp N0 , k is\northogonal to Tp N0 , and grad \u03b1(p) 6\u2208 Tp N0 .\nLet N = \u222a\u03c6t (N0 ) with \u03c6t the flow associated with grad \u03b1 and where the\nunion is taken in a small interval around t = 0. N is a codimension 1 submanifold. For small \u03b5, the integral curve of grad \u03b1 is thus contained in N, and for\nq = \u03c6t (p), we have B(q) = D\u03c6t (p)b \u2208 Tq N. Both grad \u03b1 and B are tangent\nto N by construction. By Frobenius Theorem, [B, grad \u03b1] is again tangent\nto N. In particular, [grad \u03b1, B](p) \u2208 Tp N, and hence h[grad \u03b1, B], Ki(p) = 0.\nFrom Lemma 13,\n2D2 \u03b1(B, K) = grad \u03b1(hB, Ki) \u2212 h[grad \u03b1, B], Ki = grad \u03b1(hB, Ki)\nat p as wanted.\nProof of Theorem 12. The second covariant derivative is a symmetric bilinear form. Thus,\nD2 \u03b1(p)(v, v) = D2 \u03b1(p)(b, b) + D2 \u03b1(p)(k, k) + 2D2 \u03b1(p)(b, k).\nTheorem 12 follows from lemmas 13 and 14.\nCorollary 15. Assume that for every p \u2208 M:\n\u2022 D\u03ba2 log(\u03b1)(p) is positive semi-definite in (Tp G(p))\u22a5 ,\n\u2022 For b \u2208 Tp M, b \u22a5 Tp G(p), we have that D\u03c6t (p)b \u22a5 T\u03c6t (p) G(\u03c6t (p)).\nHere, \u03c6t (q) = \u03c6(t, q) is the flow of grad \u03b1, defined for t \u2208 (\u2212\u03b5, \u03b5) and\nq close enough to p.\n\u2022 For every a \u2208 g, the associated vector field K(q) =\nq \u2208 M , satisfies\n\nd\n(exp(ta)q) |t=0 ,\ndt\n\n\u03b1D(kKk2 )(grad \u03b1) + kKk2 kgrad \u03b1k2 \u2265 0.\nThen, \u03b1 is self-convex in M.\n\n19\n\n\fProof. \u03b1 is self-convex if and only if D\u03ba2 log(\u03b1) is positive semi-definite. Now,\nlet v = b + k \u2208 M. According to Theorem 12,\nD\u03ba2 log(\u03b1)(p)(v, v) = D\u03ba2 log(\u03b1)(p)(b, b)+\n1\nhgrad\u03ba ((kKk\u03ba )2 )(p), grad\u03ba log(\u03b1)(p)i\u03ba,p + grad\u03ba,p \u03b1(hB, Ki\u03ba )(p),\n2\nwhere K is as defined in Theorem 12 and B is a vector field such that\nB(\u03c6t (p)) = D\u03c6t (p)b. Note that grad\u03ba \u03b1(hB, Ki\u03ba ) depends only on the value\nof B, and K along the integral curve \u03c6t (p). Moreover,\nhB, Ki\u03ba (\u03c6t (p)) = \u03b1(\u03c6t (p))hB(\u03c6t (p)), K(\u03c6t (p))i =\n\u03b1(\u03c6t (p))hD\u03c6t (p)(b), K(\u03c6t (p))i = 0,\nfrom the second item in the hypotheses of our corollary. Thus, we have\nD\u03ba2 log(\u03b1)(p)(v, v) =\n1\nD\u03ba2 log(\u03b1)(p)(b, b) + hgrad\u03ba ((kKk\u03ba )2 )(p), grad\u03ba log(\u03b1)(p)i\u03ba,p .\n2\nThis quantity has to be non-negative for every v or, equivalently,\n\u2022 D\u03ba2 log \u03b1(p) has to be positive semi-definite in (Tp G(p))\u22a5 , and\n\u2022 hgrad\u03ba ((kKk\u03ba )2 )(p), grad\u03ba log(\u03b1)(p)i\u03ba,p \u2265 0 for every vector field K,\nK(q) = dtd (exp(ta)q)kt=0 where a \u2208 g.\nThe second of these two items can be re-written using the original Riemannian structure h*, *i. Note that\n(kKk\u03ba )2 = \u03b1kKk2 ,\n1\ngrad \u03b1\ngrad (\u03b1kKk2 ) = grad kKk2 + kKk2\n,\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n1\ngrad \u03b1\ngrad\u03ba log(\u03b1) = grad (log \u03b1) =\n.\n\u03b1\n\u03b12\n\ngrad\u03ba ((kKk\u03ba )2 ) =\n\nThus,\nhgrad \u03ba ((kKk\u03ba )2 ), grad\u03ba log(\u03b1)i\u03ba = hgrad kKk2 + kKk2\n=\n\ngrad \u03b1 grad \u03b1\n,\ni\n\u03b1\n\u03b12\n\n\u0001\n1\n\u03b1D(kKk2 )(grad \u03b1) + kKk2 kgrad \u03b1k2 .\n3\n\u03b1\n\nThe corollary follows.\n20\n\n\f4\n\nSelf-convexity in spaces of matrices\n\nLet u \u2264 n and (k) = (k1 , . . . , ku ) \u2208 Nu such that k1 + * * * + ku = n. We define\nP(k) as the set of matrices A \u2208 GLn,m with u distinct singular values\n\u03c31 (A) > * * * > \u03c3u (A) > 0,\n\u03c3i (A) having the multiplicity ki . Such a matrix has a singular value decomposition A = U DV \u2217 with U \u2208 Un , V \u2208 Um and D \u2208 GLn,m with\n!\nk\nk\nz }|u {\nz }|1 {\nD = diag \u03c31 , . . . , \u03c31 , . . . , \u03c3u , . . . , \u03c3u = diag (\u03c31 Ik1 , . . . , \u03c3u Iku ) .\nAbove, Un is the group of unitary n \u00d7 n matrices. If K = R, it should be\nreplaced by the group of orthogonal n \u00d7 n matrices.\nWe also let\n\b\nD(k) = D \u2208 P(k) : D = diag (\u03c31 Ik1 , . . . , \u03c3u Iku ) , \u03c31 > * * * > \u03c3u .\nNotice that the singular values \u03c31 > * * * > \u03c3u can vary within each P(k)\nor each D(k).\nProposition 16. P(k) is a real smooth embedded submanifold of GLn,m .

To prove that P(k) is a real smooth embedded submanifold of GLn,m\nwe use Lemma 33 (see the appendix). We take G = Un \u00d7 Um , M = GLn,m ,\nand D = D(k) . The group action of G on M is given by\n(U, V, X) \u2208 G \u00d7 GLn,m \u2192 U XV \u2217 \u2208 GLn,m .\nUnder this action, the image of D(k) is P(k) . Define the equivalence relation\nR in Un \u00d7 Um \u00d7 D(k) by\n(U, V, D)R(U 0 , V 0 , D0 ) if and only if U DV \u2217 = U 0 D0 V 0\u2217 .\nSince D is diagonal this is equivalent to\nD0 = D, U 0 = U M, V 0 = V MW ,\nwhere M and MW are unitary block-diagonal matrices\nM = diag (U1 , . . . , Uu ), MW = diag (U1 , . . . , Uu , W ),\nwith Ui \u2208 Uki , and W \u2208 Um\u2212n . Note that the set I(k) of such pairs (M, MW )\nis the isotropy group of any D \u2208 D(k) . Also, the relation R is invariant under\nleft Un \u00d7 Um action, namely:\n(U, V, D)R(U 0 , V 0 , D0 ) \u21d4 (QU, RV, D)R(QU 0 , RV 0 , D0 )\nfor any (Q, R) \u2208 Un \u00d7 Um .\nIt is easy to see that the graph of this equivalence relation, that is the set\nof pairs ((U, V, D), (U M, V MW , D)), with U , V , D, M , and W as before, is\na closed submanifold in (G \u00d7 D(k) ) \u00d7 (G \u00d7 D(k) ). Indeed, this graph is the\nimage of the diffeomorphic embedding\nG \u00d7 D(k) \u00d7 U(k) \u00d7 (U(k) \u00d7 Um\u2212n ) \u2192\n(G \u00d7 D(k) ) \u00d7 (G \u00d7 D(k) )\n((U, V ), D, M, MW )\n7\u2192 ((U, V, D), (U M, V MW , D))\n(U(k) = Uk1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 Uku are the unitary block-diagonal matrices).\nThus the quotient space (G\u00d7D(k) )/R is equipped with a unique manifold\nstructure making \u03c0 (the canonical surjection) a submersion.\nLet us define\ni : (G \u00d7 D(k) )/R \u2192 GLn,m , i(\u03c0(U, V, D)) = U DV \u2217 .\n22\n\n\fThe injectivity of i follows by construction of R: elements of (G\u00d7D(k) )/R are\nrepresented non-uniquely by elements (U, V, D) \u2208 (G \u00d7 D(k) ). Two of those\nelements (say (U, V, D) and (U 0 , V 0 , D0 )) represent the same equivalence class\nif and only if U DV \u2217 = U 0 D0 V 0\u2217 .\nWe still have to check that this map is an immersion. For any (U\u0307 , V\u0307 , \u1e0a)\nin the tangent space T(U,V,D) G \u00d7 D(k) we have\nD(i\u25e6\u03c0)(U, V, D)(U\u0307 , V\u0307 , \u1e0a) = U\u0307 DV \u2217 +U \u1e0aV \u2217 +U DV\u0307 \u2217 = U (AD + \u1e0a \u2212DB)V \u2217\nwith U\u0307 = U A, V\u0307 = V B, A and B skew-symmetric matrices of respective size\nn and m. When AD + \u1e0a \u2212 DB = 0, we obtain, via an easy computation,\n\u1e0a = 0, A = diag (A1 , . . . , Au ), B = diag (A1 , . . . , Au , C),\nwhere Ai and C are skew-symmetric matrices of respective sizes ki and m\u2212n.\nThus (U\u0307 , V\u0307 , \u1e0a) = (U A, V B, 0) is tangent to the fiber of \u03c0 in G \u00d7 D(k) above\n\u03c0(U, V, D) so that D\u03c0(U, V, D)(U\u0307 , V\u0307 , \u1e0a) = 0. In other words\nDi(\u03c0(U, V, D))(D\u03c0(U, V, D)(U\u0307 , V\u0307 , \u1e0a)) = 0 =\u21d2 D\u03c0(U, V, D)(U\u0307 , V\u0307 , \u1e0a) = 0\nthat is Di(\u03c0(U, V, D)) is injective.\nThe last point to check to apply Lemma 33 is the continuity of the inverse\nof i. Suppose that Xp \u2192 X with Xp , X \u2208 Im i = P(k) . We can write\nthem Xp = Up Dp Vp\u2217 and X = U DV \u2217 . Let (Upq , Vpq ) be a subsequence which\nconverges to (\u0168 , \u1e7c ) (G is compact). Since Xpq \u2192 X we have Dpq \u2192 \u0168 \u2217 X \u1e7c =\nD\u0303, and \u0168 D\u0303\u1e7c \u2217 = U DV \u2217 . Now we consider the sequence \u0168 \u2217 Xp \u1e7c . It is a\nconvergent sequence, hence it has a unique limit D\u0303 and (\u0168 , \u1e7c , D\u0303)R(U, V, D).\nThus, \u03c0(\u0168 \u2217 Up , \u1e7c \u2217 Vp , Dp ) converges to \u03c0(I, I, D). By left Un \u00d7 Um action, we\nconclude that \u03c0(Up , Vp , Dp ) converges to \u03c0(U, V, D) as required.\nThus, the hypothesis of Lemma 33 is satisfied and P(k) is a real smooth\nembedded submanifold of GLn,m .\nThe computation of its dimension is easy: it is given by the difference of\nthe dimension of G \u00d7 D(k) and the dimension of the fiber above any point in\nthe quotient space, that is\ndim Un + dim Um + u \u2212 dim Uk1 \u2212 . . . \u2212 dim Uku \u2212 dim Um\u2212n .\nThe tangent space TD P(k) , D = diag (\u03c31 Ik1 , . . . , \u03c3u Iku ), is the image of\nthe tangent space T(In ,Im ,D) G \u00d7 D(k) by the derivative D(i \u25e6 \u03c0)(In , Im , D). It\n23\n\n\fis the set of matrices AD + \u1e0a \u2212 DB with \u1e0a = diag (\u03bb1 Ik1 , . . . , \u03bbu Iku ), A\nand B skew symmetric of sizes n and m. They all have the type described\nin Proposition 16 and this space of matrices has the right dimension.\nLet us prove the smoothness of the map X \u2208 P(k) \u2192 \u03c3i (X) \u2208 R. Since the\nmap (U, V, D) \u2208 G\u00d7D(k) \u2192 \u03c3i (D) is smooth, and constant in the equivalence\nclasses, the map \u03c0(U, V, D) \u2208 (G \u00d7 D(k) )/R \u2192 \u03c3i (D) = \u03c3i (U DV \u2217 ) is also\nsmooth. Thus the map X = U DV \u2217 \u2208 P(k) \u2192 \u03c3i (X) is smooth as the\ncomposition of the previous map by i\u22121 .\nLemma 17. Let I be an open interval. Let (\u03b3(t))t\u2208I be a smooth path in\nP(k) . Then, there are smooth paths U (t) \u2208 Un , V (t) \u2208 Um and \u03a3(t) \u2208 D(k)\nso that\n\u03b3(t) = U (t)\u03a3(t)V (t)\u2217\n(4.1)\nfor all t \u2208 I.\nWe give two quite different proofs of this result.\nProof. Consider the mapping \u03c0 : Un \u00d7 D(k) \u00d7 Um \u2192 P(k) sending (U, D, V )\nto U DV \u2217 . Note that \u03c0 is surjective. We claim that it is also a submersion:\nby unitary invariance, we may assume that U = In , V = Im . Then, for\nskew-symmetric matrices A, B of respective sizes n, m, we have:\nD\u03c0(I, D, V )(A, \u1e0a, B) = AD + \u1e0a + DB.\nIt is a simple exercise to check that one can get any matrix in the tangent\nspace TD P(k) , computed in Proposition 16, by choosing appropriate A, B.\nThus, D\u03c0(I, D, I) is surjective, and \u03c0 is a submersion.\nFinally, we claim that \u03c0 is also a proper map (i.e. the preimage of a\ncompact set is a compact set): let K \u2286 P(k) be a compact subset. The\nmapping sending a matrix to its (ordered) singular values is continuous, and\nhence the set of singular values of matrices in K is the continuous image of a\ncompact set, thus a compact set, call it K 0 \u2286 D(k) . Thus, \u03c0 \u22121 (K) is a closed\n(because \u03c0 is continuous) subset of the compact set Un \u00d7 K 0 \u00d7 Um , thus a\ncompact set. This proves that \u03c0 is proper.\nA theorem by Ehresmann [15] (see [25, Th. 5.1] for a general version on\na more modern framework) says that, under these hypotheses, \u03c0 is actually\na locally trivial fibration which implies that it defines a fiberbundle. Hence,\n\u03c0 has the homotopy lifting property and in particular any path in P(k) can\nbe smoothly lifted to a path in Un \u00d7 D(k) \u00d7 Um as wanted.\n\n24\n\n\fAs an alternative, we have:\nProof. We will show that U (t), V (t) and \u03a3(t) are solutions of a certain\ndifferential equation on the manifold Un \u00d7 Um \u00d7 D(k) . An important fact to\nbe used below is that TI Un is the space of skew-hermitian matrices. In the\nreal case, TI On is the space of skew-symmetric matrices. Let us assume for\na while that (4.1) admits a solution. Differentiating (4.1) with respect to t,\nwe obtain after a few trivial manipulations that\nU (t)\u2217 \u03b3\u0307(t)V (t) = U (t)\u2217 U\u0307 (t)\u03a3(t) \u2212 \u03a3(t)V (t)\u2217 V\u0307 (t) + \u03a3\u0307(t).\nFor shortness, let M (t) = U (t)\u2217 \u03b3\u0307(t)V (t), A(t) = U (t)\u2217 U\u0307 (t) \u2208 TI Un and\nB(t) = V (t)\u2217 V\u0307 (t) \u2208 TI Um . We have now:\nM (t) = A(t)\u03a3(t) \u2212 \u03a3(t)B(t) + \u03a3\u0307(t).\nUsing block notation, we obtain for i < j that\nMij (t) = \u03c3j (t)Aij (t) \u2212 \u03c3i (t)Bij (t).\nThe equation for block Mji (t) reads:\nMji (t) = \u03c3i (t)Aji (t) \u2212 \u03c3j (t)Bji (t).\nTransposing,\nMji (t)\u2217 = \u2212\u03c3i (t)Aij (t) + \u03c3j (t)Bij (t).\nWe obtain therefore\n(\n\nAij =\nBij =\n\n1\n\u03c3j2 \u2212\u03c3i2\n1\n\u03c3j2 \u2212\u03c3i2\n\n(\u03c3j Mij (t) + \u03c3i Mji (t)\u2217 )\n(\u03c3i Mij (t) + \u03c3j Mji (t)\u2217 )\n\n(4.2)\n\nThe blocks in the diagonal (that is, i = j) are of the form\nMii (t) = \u03c3i (Aii \u2212 Bii ) + \u03c3\u0307i Iki ,\nhence we can solve by setting\nAii = \u2212Bii =\n\n1\n(Mii (t) \u2212 \u03c3\u0307i Iki ).\n2\u03c3i\n\n(4.3)\n\nEquations (4.2)-(4.3) are a system of smooth non-autonomous ordinary differential equations in variables U \u2208 Un , V \u2208 Um and \u03a3 \u2208 D(k) . The Lipschitz\n25\n\n\fcondition holds. Hence, for every t0 \u2208 I, there are \u000f > 0 and local solutions\nU (t), V (t) and \u03a3(t) for t \u2208 (t0 \u2212 \u000f, t0 + \u000f), solving (4.1).\nIn order to show the existence of a global solution on all the interval,\nwe need to check that as t \u2192 t0 + \u000f, the solution converges to a limit in\nUn \u00d7 Um \u00d7 D(k) . The convergence of U (t) and V (t) follows from compactness\nof the unitary group. Because \u03b3(t0 + \u000f) \u2208 P(k) ,\nlim \u03a3(t) \u2208 D(k) .\n\nt\u2192t0 +\u000f\n\nHence, the solution (U (t), V (t), \u03a3(t)) can be extended to an interval that is\nopen and closed in I, hence to all I.\nLet \u03b1 : GLn,m be defined by \u03b1(A) = \u03c3n (A)\u22122 . We also denote by \u03b1 = \u03c3u\u22122\nits restriction to P(k) or to D(k) . We first consider the case of diagonal\nmatrices, then we prove self-convexity of \u03b1 in P(k) .\nLemma 18. Let P(k) be equipped with the condition metric structure\nh*, *i\u03ba = \u03c3u\u22122 Re h*, *iF .\n1. If \u03a31 , \u03a32 \u2208 D(k) , then any minimizing condition geodesic in P(k) joining\n\u03a31 and \u03a32 lies in D(k) ,\n2. The set D(k) is a totally geodesic submanifold of P(k) for the condition\nmetric, namely, every geodesic in D(k) for the induced structure is also\na geodesic in P(k) , or equivalently:\n3. If \u03a3 \u2208 D(k) and \u03a3\u0307 \u2208 T\u03a3 D(k) , then the unique geodesic in P(k) through\n\u03a3 with tangent vector \u03a3\u0307 at \u03a3, remains in D(k) .\nMoreover, \u03b1 = \u03c3u\u22122 is log-convex in D(k) .\nProof. According to Proposition 16, P(k) is a smooth Riemannian manifold\nfor the condition structure.\nLet \u03b3(t), 0 \u2264 t \u2264 T, be a minimizing condition geodesic with endpoints\n\u03a31 and \u03a32 \u2208 D(k) . Let \u03b3(t) = Ut \u03a3t Vt\u2217 be a singular value decomposition of\n\u03b3(t), choosen as in Lemma 17. Let \u03c3u (t) be the smallest singular value of\n\u03b3(t). It suffices to see that L\u03ba (\u03a3) \u2264 L\u03ba (\u03b3) that is\nZ T\nZ T\n\u22121\nk\u03a3\u0307t kF \u03c3u (t) dt \u2264\nk\u03b3\u0307t kF \u03c3u (t)\u22121 dt.\n0\n\n0\n\n26\n\n\fSince\n\u03b3\u0307t = U\u0307t \u03a3t Vt\u2217 + Ut \u03a3\u0307t Vt\u2217 + Ut \u03a3t V\u0307t\u2217 ,\nwith U\u0307t = Ut At , V\u0307t = Vt Bt , At and Bt skew-symmetric, we see that\nk\u03b3\u0307t k2F = kAt \u03a3t + \u03a3\u0307t \u2212 \u03a3t Bt k2F = k\u03a3\u0307t k2F + kAt \u03a3t \u2212 \u03a3t Bt k2F \u2265 k\u03a3\u0307t k2F\nbecause the diagonal terms in \u03a3\u0307t are real numbers and those of At \u03a3t \u2212 \u03a3t Bt\nare purely imaginary when K = C and vanish when K = R. When \u03b3t does\nnot belong to D(k) , then the inequality above is strict.\nThe second assertion is an easy consequence of the first one. The third assertion is another classical characterization of totally geodesic submanifolds,\nsee [23] Chapter 4, Proposition 13 or Theorem 5.\nFinally, for log-convexity of \u03b1(X) = \u03c3u (X)\u22122 , using [2] Proposition 3, it\nsuffices to see that for \u03a3 \u2208 D(k) and \u03a3\u0307 \u2208 T\u03a3 D(k) ,\n2k\u03a3\u0307k2 kD\u03c3u (\u03a3)k2 \u2265 D2 \u03c3u2 (\u03a3)(\u03a3\u0307, \u03a3\u0307),\n\n(4.4)\n\nwhere the second derivative is computed in the Frobenius metric structure.\nNow,\nD(\u03c3u )(\u03a3)(\u03a3\u0307) = \u03c3u (\u03a3\u0307).\nThus\n\n2\n\nD(\u03c3u )(\u03a3)(\u03a3\u0307)\nis maximized for the 'unit vector' (in block representation)\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n0k1\n\uf8fa\n1 \uf8ef\n***\n\uf8fa.\n\u03a3\u0307 = \u221a \uf8ef\n\uf8fb\n0ku\u22121\nku \uf8f0\nIku\nWe deduce that\nkD\u03c3u (\u03a3)k2 =\nhence\n2k\u03a3\u0307k2 kD\u03c3u (\u03a3)k2 =\n\n1\n,\nku\n\n2k\u03a3\u0307k2\n\u2265 2\u03c3u (\u03a3).\nku\n\nThe right-hand-side of (4.4) is precisely\nD2 \u03c3u2 (\u03a3)(\u03a3\u0307, \u03a3\u0307) = D(2\u03c3u (\u03a3)\u03c3u (\u03a3\u0307))(\u03a3\u0307) = 2\u03c3u (\u03a3\u0307)2 ,\nand equation (4.4) follows.\n27\n\n\fProposition 19. The map \u03b1 = \u03c3u\u22122 is self-convex in P(k) .\nProof. By unitary invariance, we may choose as initial point a matrix \u03a3 \u2208\nD(k) with ordered distinct diagonal entries \u03c31 > . . . > \u03c3u > 0. We use\nCorollary 15, with the group G being Un \u00d7 Um and the action\nUn \u00d7 Um \u00d7 P(k) \u2212\u2192 P(k)\n((U, V ), A)\n7\u2192 U AV \u2217 .\nThe Lie algebra of G is the set An \u00d7 Am where Ak is the set of k \u00d7 k skewsymmetric matrices.\nWe write G(L) for the G-orbit of a point L \u2208 P(k) . In our case, this is\nthe manifold of all U LV \u2217 with U \u2208 Un , V \u2208 Um . The tangent space to the\nLie group action at L is the tangent manifold TL G(L) \u2286 TL P(k) .\nFirst, we note that for any L \u2208 D(k) , we have\n(TL G(L))\u22a5 = TL {U LV \u2217 : U \u2208 Un , V \u2208 Um }\u22a5 =\n{B1 L + LB2\u2217 : (B1 , B2 ) \u2208 An \u00d7 Am }\u22a5 .\nLet us denote by S this last set. We claim that S = D(k) . Indeed, D(k) \u2286 S,\nbecause the diagonal of any matrix of the form B1 L+LB2\u2217 is purely imaginary\nand hence orthogonal to D(k) . The other inclusion is easily checked by a\ndimensional argument: The dimension of D(k) is u and the dimension of S is\ndim(P(k) ) \u2212 dim {B1 L + LB2\u2217 : (B1 , B2 ) \u2208 An \u00d7 Am } ,\nthat is dim(P(k) ) minus the dimension of the orbit of L under the action of\nUn \u00d7 Um . We have computed these two quantities in Proposition 16, and we\nimmediately conclude that dim(S) = u, for both K = C and K = R. Thus,\nfor all L \u2208 D(k) ,\n(TL G(L))\u22a5 = D(k) .\nWe now check the three conditions of Corollary 15.\n\u2022 D\u03ba2 log(\u03b1)(\u03a3) is positive semi-definite in (T\u03a3 G(\u03a3))\u22a5 : let\n\u03a3\u0307 \u2208 (T\u03a3 G(\u03a3))\u22a5 = T\u03a3 D(k) ,\nand let \u03b3 be a condition geodesic in D(k) such that \u03b3(0) = \u03a3, \u03b3\u0307(0) = \u03a3\u0307.\nWe have to check that\nd2\nlog \u03b1(\u03b3(t)) |t=0 \u2265 0.\ndt2\nThis is true as \u03b1 is log-convex in D(k) from Lemma 18.\n28\n\n\f\u2022 We have to check that for small enough t, and for\n\u03a3\u0307 \u2208 (T\u03a3 G(\u03a3))\u22a5 = T\u03a3 D(k) ,\nD\u03c6t (D)\u03a3\u0307 belongs to\nT\u03c6t (\u03a3) G(\u03a3)\u22a5 = T\u03a3 D(k) ,\nwhere \u03c6t is the flow of grad\u03ba \u03b1. In our case, \u03c6t can be computed exactly.\nIndeed,\n2\n1\nE,\ngrad\u03ba \u03b1 = grad \u03b1 = \u2212\n\u03b1\nku \u03c3u\nwhere\nk\nz }|u {\nE = diag (0, . . . , 0, 1, . . . , 1).\nThus, grad \u03b1 preserves the diagonal form, and \u03c6t (\u03a3) \u2208 D(k) is a diagonal matrix, for every t while defined. Thus, D\u03c6t (\u03a3)(\u03a3\u0307) is again a\ndiagonal matrix, for every diagonal matrix \u03a3\u0307. This proves that the\nsecond condition of Corollary 15 applies to our case.\n\u2022 For (B1 , B2 ) \u2208 An \u00d7 Am , the vector field K on GLn,m generated by\n(B1 , B2 ) is\nK(A) =\n\nd tB1 tB2\u2217 \u0001\ne Ae\n|t=0 = B1 A + AB2\u2217 .\ndt\n\nNote that\n1.

This finishes the proof of Lemma 20 and hence of Proposition\n19.\n\n5\n\nPuting pieces together\n\nBefore stating the main result of this section we have to introduce the following machinery:\n\n5.1\n\nSecond symmetric derivatives\n\nIn the case of Lipschitz-Riemann structures, the mappings we want to consider are not necessarily C 2 and, to study their convexity properties, an approach based on the usual covariant second derivative is insufficient. We will\nuse instead the second symmetric upper derivative.\nLet U \u2286 Rk be an open set and \u03c6 : U \u2192 R be any function. The second\nsymmetric upper derivative of \u03c6 at x \u2208 U in the direction v \u2208 Rk is\nSD 2 \u03c6(x; v) = lim sup\nh7\u21920\n\n\u03c6(x + hv) + \u03c6(x \u2212 hv) \u2212 2\u03c6(x)\nh2\n\n31\n\n\fwhich is allowed to be \u00b1\u221e. If U \u2286 R is an interval, we simply write SD 2 \u03c6(x)\nfor SD 2 \u03c6(x; 1).\nIt is well-known that a continuous function \u03c6 on an interval is convex if\nand only if SD 2 \u03c6(x) \u2265 0 for all x (see for example [31] Theorem 5.29). There\nis a stronger result due to Burkill [9] Theorem 1.1 (see also [31] Corollary\n5.31) which uses a weaker hypothesis:\nTheorem 21 (Burkill). Let \u03c6 :]a, b[\u2192 R be a continuous function such that\nSD 2 \u03c6(x) \u2265 0 for almost all x \u2208]a, b[, and assume that SD 2 \u03c6(x) > \u2212\u221e for\nx \u2208]a, b[. Then, \u03c6 is a convex function.\nTheorem 21 will allow us to assemble the pieces where convexity is proven\nin Proposition 19 to prove our main results (Theorems 1 and 31). We proceed\na little more generally as the result may be of interest in other circumstances.\nLet M be a k-dimensional C 2 manifold (not necessarily having a Riemannian\nstructure).\nDefinition 22. Let \u03b1 : M \u2192 R. We say that SD 2 \u03b1 is bounded from \u2212\u221e\n(denoted SD 2 \u03b1 > \u2212\u221e) if for every x \u2208 M there is an open neighborhood\nUx \u2286 M and a coordinate chart \u03c6x : Ux \u2192 Rk , \u03c6x (x) = 0 such that\nSD 2 (\u03b1 \u25e6 \u03c6\u22121\nx )(0; v) > \u2212\u221e\nfor every v \u2208 Rk .\nThe following lemma is a consequence of Definition 22.\nLemma 23.

In particular, SD 2 \u03b1 > \u2212\u221e if and only if\nSD 2 (log \u25e6\u03b1) > \u2212\u221e.\nProof. The if part is trivial (just make \u03c6(t) = t). In order to prove the only\nif part, we assume that SD 2 \u03b1 > \u2212\u221e. Let x \u2208 M and let \u03c6x : Ux \u2192 Rk be\na coordinate chart such that \u03c6x (x) = 0 and SD 2 (\u03b1 \u25e6 \u03c6\u22121\nx )(0; v) > \u2212\u221e for\neach v \u2208 Rk .

Let M be a C 3 Riemannian manifold with distance d, of\ndimension k, and let N be a submanifold of dimension p.\nLet us first define the projection onto N (Fig.1). To each q \u2208 N and\nto a vector u 6= 0 normal to N at q we associate the geodesic \u03b3q,u in M such\nthat \u03b3q,u (0) = q and \u03b3\u0307q,u (0) = u. Let n \u2208 N be given, and let U be an open\nneighborhood of n such that, for each m \u2208 U there exists a unique geodesic\narc \u03b3q,u (t), t in an open interval containing 0, contained in U and containing\nm. Thus U is the union of such geodesic arcs and two of them have always\na void intersection. This picture defines a map K : U \u2192 N by K(m) = q\n37\n\n\fu\n\nM\n\n\u03b3q,u\nN\n\nm\nK\nq\n\nn\n\nU\n\nFigure 1: The projection K : M \u2192 N .\nif m = \u03b3q,u (t). The map K is the projection map onto N . It has the\nfollowing classical properties:\n1. It is defined in the neighborhood U of n \u2208 N ,\n2. For each m \u2208 U , K(m) is the unique point in M such that\ninf d(m, q) = d(m, K(m))\n\nq\u2208N\n\n3. K is C 2 .\nSee Li-Nirenberg [21] or Beltran-Dedieu-Malajovich-Shub [2].\nLet \u03b1 : M \u2192]0, \u221e[ be a locally Lipschitz, regular map (see section 2.3).\nIt defines a conformal Lipschitz-Riemann structure on M associated with\nthe inner product\nh*, *i\u03b1,m = \u03b1(m) h*, *im .\nWe call it the \u03b1\u2212structure. We suppose that \u03b1 is C 2 when it is restricted to\nN so that N is C 2 and not only Lipschitz for the induced \u03b1\u2212structure.\nProposition 27. Under the hypotheses above, let \u03b3 : [a, b] \u2192 M be a\ngeodesic curve in M for the \u03b1\u2212structure. Then, there exists a zero-measure\nset Z \u2286 [a, b] such that for t0 \u2208 [a, b] \\ Z the following holds:\n38\n\n\f\"If \u03b3(t0 ) \u2208 N and \u03b3\u0307(t0 ) \u2208 T\u03b3(t0 ) N , then the projection \u03b3N (t) = (K \u25e6 \u03b3)(t)\nof \u03b3 onto N has a contact of order 2 with \u03b4(t), the unique geodesic in N\nsuch that \u03b4(t0 ) = \u03b3(t0 ) and \u03b4\u0307(t0 ) = \u03b3\u0307(t0 )\".\nRemark 28. If M, N and \u03b1 are assumed to be smooth then Z = \u2205 in\nProposition 27. See for example the proof of Proposition 5.9 in [33].\nProof. The proof consists in a transfer from M to Rk where we apply Proposition 27. Let\n\u001b\n\u001a\n\u03b3N (t) \u2212 \u03b4(t)\n6= 0 .\nZ = t0 \u2208 [a, b] : \u03b3(t0 ) \u2208 N , \u03b3\u0307(t0 ) \u2208 T\u03b3(t0 ) N but lim\nt\u2192t0\n(t \u2212 t0 )2\nWe have to check that Z is a zero measure set. It suffices to see that for\nevery t \u2208 (a, b) there is an open interval I containing t and such that I \u2229 Z\nhas zero measure. Without loss of generality, we may assume that t = 0.\nThus, let t = 0 \u2208 (a, b) and let n = \u03b3(0).\nSince M is C 3 , the normal bundle to N is C 2 and there exists a C 2\ndiffeomorphism \u03c6 : U \u2192 V \u2282 Rk , where V is an open set containing 0,\nsatisfying\n1. \u03c6(n) = 0,\n2. \u03c6(U \u2229 N ) = V \u2229 (Rp \u00d7 {0}),\n3. For any q \u2208 N and any vector u 6= 0 normal to N at q, \u03c6 (\u03b3q,u ) is a\nstraight line in Rk orthogonal to Rp \u00d7 {0}.\nWe make \u03c6 an isometry in defining on V \u2282 Rk a Lipschitz-Riemannian\nstructure by\nhD\u03c6(m)u, D\u03c6(m)vi\u03c6(m) = \u03b1(m) hu, vim\nfor any m \u2208 U , and u, v \u2208 Tm M. Let us denote x = \u03c6(m), a = D\u03c6(m)u,\nb = D\u03c6(m)v, we also write this scalar product\nha, bix = bT H(x)a\nwhere H is a locally Lipschitz map from V into the k \u00d7 k positive definite\nmatrices.\nNotice that H is regular because \u03b1 is regular in N .\nSince for every n\u0302 \u2208 N \u2229 U ,\n\u0010\n\u0011\nD\u03c6(n\u0302) (Tn\u0302 N ) = Rp \u00d7 {0} and D\u03c6(n\u0302) (Tn\u0302 N )\u22a5 = {0} \u00d7 Rk\u2212p ,\n39\n\n\fH(x) has the block structure\n\u0012\nH(x) =\n\nHp (x)\n0\n0\nHk\u2212p (x)\n\n\u0013\n.\n\nSince \u03b1 is C 2 when restricted to N we have the same regularity for the\nrestriction of H to Rp \u00d7 {0}.\nSince \u03c6 is an isometry the curves \u03c6 \u25e6 \u03b3 and \u03c6 \u25e6 \u03b4 are geodesics in Rk and\nRp \u00d7{0} respectively, and, from the definition of \u03c6, the orthogonal projection\n(in the Euclidean meaning) of \u03c6 \u25e6 \u03b3 onto Rp \u00d7 {0} is equal to \u03c6 \u25e6 \u03b3N .\nThus, the hypotheses of Proposition 26 are satisfied so that \u03c6 \u25e6 \u03b3N and\n\u03c6 \u25e6 \u03b4 have an order 2 contact at every t out of a zero measure set Z0 . This\ngives easily an order 2 contact for \u03b3N and \u03b4 at t 6\u2208 Z0 in M in terms of the\n\u03b1\u2212distance but also, since 1/\u03b1 is locally Lipschitz, in terms of the initial\nRiemannian distance. The proposition follows.\n\n5.4\n\nArriving to the main theorem\n\nWe are now ready to state the main theorem in this section:\n3\nTheorem 29 (Piecing together). M = \u222a\u221e\ni=1 Mi is a C Riemannian manifold, enumerable union of the submanifolds Mi . Let \u03b1 : M \u2192]0, \u221e[ be a\nlocally Lipschitz mapping. Assume that:\n\n1. \u03b1 is regular,\n2. For each i, the restriction of \u03b1 to Mi is C 2 and self-convex in Mi ,\n3. SD 2 \u03b1 > \u2212\u221e.\nThen, \u03b1 is self-convex in M.\nProof. Once again we add to M the \u03b1\u2212structure. If this theorem is false,\nthere exists a geodesic \u03b3 in M for the \u03b1\u2212structure such that\nSD 2 log(\u03b1(\u03b3(t))) < 0\non a positive measure set P \u2282 R (Theorem 21 and Lemma 23). Since an\nenumerable union of zero-measure sets is also a zero-measure set, we can\nsuppose that P \u2282 Mi for some i, so that \u03b3(t) \u2208 Mi for every t \u2208 P .\n40\n\n\fAccording to the Lebesgue Density Theorem, almost all points t \u2208 P are\ndensity points, that is\nmeas (P \u2229 [t \u2212 \u03b5, t + \u03b5])\n= 1.\n\u03b5\u21920\n2\u03b5\nlim\n\nWe remove the \"non-density points\" from P to obtain a new set, also called\nP , with positive measure and only density points. Since \u03b3 \u2208 C 1+Lip (Theorem\n3), the second derivative \u03b3\u0308(t) exists for almost all t. We also remove from P\nthe zero measure set of Proposition 27.\nLet t \u2208 P be given. Since it is a density point of P , we have s \u2208 P for \"a\nlot of points\" close to t. Since \u03b3(s) \u2208 Mi for such points, and since \u03b3 is C 1 ,\nwe get\n\u03b3\u0307(t) \u2208 T\u03b3(t) Mi .\nTake now the geodesic \u03b4 in Mi for the induced \u03b1\u2212structure such that \u03b4(t) =\n\u03b3(t) and \u03b4\u0307(t) = \u03b3\u0307(t). As we have removed the zero-measure set of Proposition\n27, \u03b3i and \u03b4 have a contact of order 2 at t.\nBy self-convexity of \u03b1 in Mi , and since \u03b4 is C 2 we get\nSD 2 log \u25e6\u03b1 \u25e6 \u03b4(t) =\n\nd2\nlog \u25e6\u03b1 \u25e6 \u03b4(t) \u2265 0.\ndt2\n\nLet us now consider\n\u22062 (h) =\n\nlog \u25e6\u03b1 \u25e6 \u03b3(t + h) + log \u25e6\u03b1 \u25e6 \u03b3(t \u2212 h) \u2212 2 log \u25e6\u03b1 \u25e6 \u03b3(t)\n.\nh2\n\nIt is not difficult to prove that t is a density point of\nQ = {s = t + h \u2208 P : t \u2212 h \u2208 P } .\nLet us denote by \u03b3i the projection of \u03b3 on Mi (see section 5.3). For the\npoints s = t + h \u2208 Q, one has \u03b3(t + h) = \u03b3i (t + h), \u03b3(t \u2212 h) = \u03b3i (t \u2212 h), and\n\u03b3(t) = \u03b3i (t), thus\n\u22062 (h) =\n\nlog \u25e6\u03b1 \u25e6 \u03b3i (t + h) + log \u25e6\u03b1 \u25e6 \u03b3i (t \u2212 h) \u2212 2 log \u25e6\u03b1 \u25e6 \u03b3i (t)\n.\nh2\n\nFrom the contact of order 2 between \u03b3i and \u03b4 we then conclude,\n\u22062 (h) =\n\nlog \u25e6\u03b1 \u25e6 \u03b4(t + h) + log \u25e6\u03b1 \u25e6 \u03b4(t \u2212 h) \u2212 2 log \u25e6\u03b1 \u25e6 \u03b4(t) + o(h2 )\n.\nh2\n41\n\n\fSince \u03b4 is C 2 , taking the limit as h \u2192 0 gives\nlim \u22062 (h) =\n\nd2\nlog \u25e6\u03b1 \u25e6 \u03b4(t).\ndt2\n\nSince this last expression is nonegative we obtain\nSD 2 log(\u03b1(\u03b3(t))) \u2265 lim \u22062 (h) \u2265 0\nwhich contradicts our hypothesis SD 2 log(\u03b1(\u03b3(t))) < 0 on P .\n\n6\n\nProof of Theorem 1\n\nTheorem 1 is a consequence of Theorem 29 applied to M = GLn,m considered\nas the union of the submanifolds P(k) (see section 4) and to the mapping\n\u03b1(A) = \u03c3n (A)\u22122 , the inverse of the square of the smallest singular value of\nA \u2208 GLn,m .

This finishes the proof of our Main Theorem 1.\n\n7\n\nThe solution variety\n\nAs in [2], we are also interested in the log\u2013convexity of \u03c3n (A)\u22121 in the solution\nvariety:\nW = {(A, x) \u2208 GLn,n+1 \u00d7 P(Kn+1 ) : Ax = 0}.\nRemark 30. In [2] we have sometimes taken A to lie in the unit sphere of\nKn\u00d7m or even the projective space P(Kn\u00d7m ). The interested reader can check\n[2] for the relations between self-convexity in the various settings.\nTheorem 31. For any condition geodesic t \u2192 (A(t), x(t)) in W, the map\nt \u2192 log (\u03c3n\u22122 (A(t))) is convex.\nAs we have done in the case of GLn,m , we divide the proof in several\nsections.\n\n7.1\n\nThe smooth part of W\n\nLet u \u2264 n and (k) = (k1 , . . . , ku ) \u2208 Nu such that k1 + * * * + ku = n. We define\nW(k) = {(A, x) \u2208 W : A \u2208 P(k) }.\nProposition 32. For any choice of (k), the set W(k) is a smooth submanifold\nof W, \u03c3u is a smooth function and \u03b1 = \u03c3u\u22122 is self\u2013convex in W(k) .\nProof. Let us consider the map\n\u03c8 : P(k) \u00d7 Kn+1 \\ {0} \u2192 Kn\n(A, x)\n7\u2192 Ax\nwhich is a smooth mapping between two smooth manifolds. Since 0 is a\nregular value of \u03c8, its preimage \u03c8 \u22121 (0) is a smooth submanifold of P(k) \u00d7\nKn+1 \\ {0}. Moreover, \u03c3u is the composition of the projection onto the first\ncoordinate W(k) \u2192 P(k) and the function \u03c3u which is smooth by Proposition\n43\n\n\f16. To check that \u03c3u is self\u2013convex in W(k) we use Corollary 15 and proceed\nas in the proof of Proposition 19. Let G = Un \u00d7 Un+1 , and consider the\naction\nG \u00d7 W(k)\n\u2192\nW(k)\n((U, V ), (A, x)) 7\u2192 (U AV \u2217 , V x)\nLet p = (\u03a3, en+1 ) where eTn+1 = (0, . . . , 0, 1) and \u03a3 \u2208 D(k) has ordered distinct\nsingular values \u03c31 > * * * > \u03c3u > 0. Recall that Tp G(p) is the tangent space\nin p of the orbit G(p) of p by the Lie group G. As in Propositions 16 and 19,\nwe have\nTp G(p) = {(B1 \u03a3 + \u03a3B2\u2217 , B2 en+1 ) : (B1 , B2 ) \u2208 An \u00d7 An+1 },\nTp G(p)\u22a5 = {(\u03a3\u0307, 0) : \u03a3\u0307 \u2208 P(k) , \u03a3\u0307 is diagonal, \u03a3\u0307en+1 = 0}.\nNote that Tp G(p)\u22a5 is isometric to the set of diagonal n \u00d7 n matrices with\neigenvalues \u03c31 > . . . > \u03c3u > 0 of respective multiplicities k1 , . . . , ku .\nLet us check the conditions of Corollary 15. By unitary invariance, we\ncan choose a pair p = (\u03a3, en+1 ) as above.\n1. D\u03ba2 log(\u03b1)(p) is positive semi-definite in (Tp G(p))\u22a5 : let (\u03a3\u0307, 0) \u2208 Tp G(p)\u22a5 .\nLet \u03b3 be a condition geodesic in Tp G(p)\u22a5 such that \u03b3(0) = (\u03a3, 0), \u03b3\u0307(0) =\n(\u03a3\u0307, 0). We have to check that\nd2\nlog \u03b1(\u03b3(t)) |t=0 \u2265 0.\ndt2\nThis is true as \u03b1 is log-convex in the set of diagonal n \u00d7 n matrices with\neigenvalues \u03c31 > . . . > \u03c3u > 0 from Proposition 16.\n2. We have to check that for small enough t, and for\nb = (\u03a3\u0307, 0) \u2208 Tp G(p)\u22a5 ,\nD\u03c6t (p)b is perpendicular to\nT\u03c6t (p) G(\u03c6t (p)),\nwhere \u03c6t is the flow of grad\u03ba \u03b1 in W(k) . Now, as in the proof of Proposition 19,\nthe operator grad preserves the diagonal form of (\u03a3, en ) and hence D\u03c6t (p)b\nis of the form (\u03a30 , 0) where \u03a30 is diagonal with \u03a30 en = 0. In particular, it\nis orthogonal to T\u03c6t (p) G(\u03c6t (p)). Thus, the second condition of Corollary 15\napplies to our case.\n44\n\n\f3.

Note\nthat we have W = \u222a(k) W(k) and \u03b1 is smooth and self\u2013convex in each W(k)\nby Proposition 32. From Theorem 29 we just need to check that \u03b1 is regular\nin W and that SD 2 \u03b1 > \u2212\u221e. Since\n\u03b1 = \u03c3n\u22122 \u25e6 \u03c01 ,\nwhere \u03c01 is the projection on the first coordinate, \u03b1 is a smooth function.\nNow, consider the chart locally given by \u03c01\u22121 , and note that \u03b1 \u25e6 \u03c01\u22121 = \u03c3n\u22122 is\nregular in GLn,m from the proof of Theorem 1. By definition, this means that\n\u03b1 is regular in W(k) . Using the same argument, SD 2 \u03c3n\u22122 > \u2212\u221e in GLn,m\nalso implies that SD 2 \u03b1 > \u2212\u221e in W and we are done.\n45\n\n\f8\n\nAppendix\n\nIn this appendix we prove the following which gives a sufficient condition for\nthe image of a submanifold under a group action to be a submanifold.\nLemma 33. Let G be a Lie group acting on a smooth manifold M, and\nD a smooth submanifold in M Define on G \u00d7 D the equivalence relation\n(g, d)R(g 0 , d0 ) when gd = g 0 d0 . Let us denote by\n\u03c0 : G \u00d7 D \u2192 (G \u00d7 D)/R\nthe canonical surjection onto the quotient space, by i the map\ni : (G \u00d7 D)/R \u2192 M, i(\u03c0(g, d)) = gd,\nand by P = i((G\u00d7D)/R) the image of i. When the three following conditions\nare satisfied\n1. The graph of R is a closed embedded submanifold in (G \u00d7 D) \u00d7 (G \u00d7 D),\n2. i is an immersion,\n3. For every sequence (xk ) \u2208 (G \u00d7 D)/R such that (i(xk )) converges to\ny \u2208 P the sequence (xk ) converges,\nthen, P is an embedded submanifold in M.\nProof. Let X be a manifold and let R denote an equivalence relation defined\non X . A classical necessary and sufficient condition to define on the quotient space X /R a unique quotient manifold structure making the canonical\nsurjection \u03c0 : X \u2192 X /R a submersion is the following: the graph G of\nthe relation is an embedded submanifold in X \u00d7 X and the first projection\npr1 : G \u2192 X is a submersion (See [1, Th.3.5.25]).\nIn the context of our lemma this condition comes from the first hypothesis\nand from the definition of the equivalence relation via the group action: let\n \u0307 \u2208 T(g,d) (G \u00d7 D). Let a(t) be a curve in G and\n((g, d), (h, e)) \u2208 G. Let (\u0121, d)\nb(t) a curve in D(k) such that:\na(0) = g,\n\n\u0227(0) = \u0121,\n\nb(0) = d,\n\n\u1e03(0) = d. \u0307\n\nThen, consider the following curve contained in (G \u00d7 D) \u00d7 (G \u00d7 D) defined\nby:\n\u03b8(t) = ((a(t), b(t)), (a(t)g \u22121 h, h\u22121 gb(t))).\n46\n\n\fIt is clear that \u03b8(0) = ((g, d), (h, e)) because\nh\u22121 gb(0) = h\u22121 gd = e.\n \u0307 Moreover, it is immediate that\nIt is also clear that Dpr1 (\u03b8(0)) \u03b80 (0) = (\u0121, d).\n\u03b8(t) is contained in G. Thus, pr1 is a submersion.\nLet f : Y \u2192 Z be a smooth map between two manifolds. Its image f (Y)\nis a submanifold in Z when f is an immersion and a homeomorphism onto\nits image.\nBy construction, i is smooth. It is a homeomorphism by the third hypothesis and an immersion by the second one. To check that it is injective,\nwe have to show that if gd = g 0 d0 , then (g, d)R(g 0 , d0 ). This follows from the\nconstruction of the relation R.\n\nReferences\n[1] Abraham, R., J.E. Marsden, T. Ratiu, Manifolds, tensor analysis, and applications. Second edition.
