The use of two-dimensional catalogues in unraveling the largescale distribution of extra-galactic objects can reveal more information than\nhas been supposed if the objects have approximate scaling properties such as\nobservations suggest. After a brief general discussion of this issue, we turn to\nspecific examples of projected fractals for the case where the objects studied\nhave a Schechter luminosity function. We analyze the effects of projection on\nthe characteristics of such a fractal distribution. Our results indicate that twodimensional catalogues of sources could be of value in detecting the effects of\nluminosity functions as well as of large-scale structure.\nKey words: Large-scale structure, fractals\n1. Introduction\nWhat we now call large scale structure - the patterns revealed in the spatial distribution\nof galaxies - was first detected in attempts to quantify the distribution of galaxies on\nthe sky as revealed in position catalogues. Those first studies were mainly statistical\nand were carried out in terms of correlation functions of the galaxy positions (Neyman,\net al., 1953; Neyman and Scott, 1959; Peebles 1980), though one should also note the\nless objective but revealing studies by de Vaucouleurs (1970). In the early statistical\nwork, the galaxies were considered to be points, as they were in the related studies of\ncatalogues of radio sources under the rubric of log N \u2212 log S studies (Ryle and Clarke,\n1961; Peebles, 1983); that picture is also adopted here. From those positional studies,\nMandelbrot (1975) recognized that the galaxy distribution is well modeled by what he\nhas called a fractal distribution * (Mandelbrot, 1982).\nIn more recent times, three-dimensional galaxy catalogues have been made available\nin which the three coordinates assigned to each galaxy are two coordinates on the sky\n* We use the term fractal in its most general sense to include the special cases called\nmultifractals and monofractals, which terms have come into common use in recent years.\n\n\fR. Thieberger & E.A. Spiegel\n\nand a redshift. Though these data are not as abundant as those in the two-dimensional\ncatalogues, they nevertheless support the findings of approximate self-similarity in the\nlarge-scale distribution of galaxies within prescribed scale intervals (Provenzale, 1991).\nHowever such conclusions depend on the transformation from redshift space to geometrical space, which is not completely accurate because of the peculiar velocities of the\nobjects in question. Above all, since the data in two-dimensional catalogues are more\nplentiful than those in three dimensions and are likely to remain so for a time (Cress, et\nal., 1996), it seems worthwhile to discuss further the ways in which the two-dimensional\ndata may be used to unravel the nature of the three-dimensional distribution of extragalactic objects.\nThe basic issue in analyzing a two-dimensional catalogue goes back to work on stellar statistics (Trumpler and Weaver, 1953), with some added complications. In stellar\nstatistics, the effect of fractality was not considered much, though in the galaxy case it\nis important. What was significant in the stellar studies was the effect of the luminosity\ndistribution of the observed objects on the projected distributions, an issue is our main\nconcern here. However, rather than deal with the inverse problem implied by the integral\nequation known as the fundamental equation of stellar statistics (Trumpler and Weaver,\n1953), we shall study the effects of projection by directly simulating the projection of\nsome simple point sets. In this way, we can explicitly study the role of luminosity functions in the projection of fractals. However, for the present, we shall leave out of account\nsome other features of the galaxy case that remain to be considered in detail, namely\nsource evolution and cosmological effects (Spedalere and Schucking, 1980; Ribeiro, 1995).\nOur main concern then is not so far from that of the study of stellar statistics: disentangling the luminosity function of the observed objects from their complex distribution\non the sky. Naturally, the stellar case has difficulties of its own, such as interstellar\nabsorption. Although an analogous issue has been examined for the galaxy distribution\nby Durrer, et al. (1997), that is also something for another exploration.\nOne of our motivations for raising these issues comes from our interest in trying to\ndistinguish the different scaling regimes that may exist in the galaxy distribution, though\non different length scales. It has been suggested (Murante et al., 1998) that three scaling\nregimes may be discerned in the distribution of galaxies: on the smallest scales the results\nare consistent with a distribution of density singularities; in the intermediate range, there\nis scaling behaviour suggestive of flat structures such as Zeldovitch (1970) favored; on the\nlargest scales, the data indicate a homogeneous distribution of galaxies with nonfractal\nbehavior. This categorization is based on the results of an analysis of three-dimensional\ncatalogues. However, it has to be admitted that those data may as yet not be adequate\nfor clearly deciding such issues and that is why we wish to consider whether we may\nreliably use two-dimensional catalogues for immediate needs.\nBefore describing how projection effects are to be treated, we devote the next section\nto a brief outline of how structure in the galaxy distribution may be quantified. Then\nwe turn to the distinction between theoretical predictions and numerical calculations of\nthe effects of projection on the basis of simple examples. To understand this, we must\ntry to minimize the influence of details such as the number of points in the sets and the\nparameters of the luminosity functions.\n\n\fProjection of Fractals and the Distribution of Galaxies\n\nThen we go on to investigate the influence of luminosity effects by imposing a Schechter\nluminosity function on the objects of study and attempt to see how this influences the distribution of the projected objects, or rather of their apparent magnitudes. We conclude\nthat luminosity effects can indeed make themselves felt in the macroscopic parameters\nof the projected fractals and suggest how these issues may be included in quantitative\nanalyses of two-dimensional catalogues.\n2. Quantifying Cosmic Scaling\nIn a rarefied gas, the usual definition of density breaks down as we go to the limit of small\nvolumes. The situation is even worse for fractals where the density as usually understood\nis singular, as we shall see presently. Since the correlation functions used in the early\nanalyses of the galaxy distribution (Neyman Scott, 1959; Peebles 1980) are defined in\nterms of the density, this has led to questioning of the use of correlations for the study\nof fractal sets (Bhavsar, 1980; Coleman and Pietronero 1992). Fortunately, only a slight\nchange in approach is needed to obtain a more robust characterization of the structures\nof point sets by way of the correlation integral (Grassberger and Procaccia, 1983; Paladin\nand Vulpiani, 1984; Borgani, 1995). Indeed, the change seems so slight that one may\nbe surprised at the difference it makes. Nevertheless, explicit calculations performed on\nanalytically understood point sets have shown that the correlation integral is the more\nreliable tool of analysis of the properties of point distributions (Thieberger et al. 1990).\nFor these reasons, the correlation integral has been used increasingly in the study of\nlarge-scale structure (Provenzale, 1991) and, in this section, we briefly summarize its\nproperties and generalizations. A deeper discussion of this question is provided by Bessis\nand Fournier (1989).\nConsider then a set of N galaxies - or points - for which the correlation integral\nmay be defined as\nC2 (r) =\n\nXX\n1\n\u0398(r \u2212 |Xi \u2212 Xj |)\nN (N \u2212 1) i\n\n(2.1)\n\nj6=i\n\nwhere \u0398 is the Heaviside function and the summations are over N \u2212 1 galaxies with\ncoordinates Xj , j 6= i (Grassberger and Procaccia 1983). Modifications of this formula\nto allow for the effects of the finiteness of the sample may be introduced when dealing\nwith real data (Murante et al., 1997; Kerscher, 1999), but we pass over such technical\ndetails here.\nWe may interpret C2 (r) as N (r)/N where N (r) is the average number of galaxies\nwithin a distance r of a typical galaxy in the set. As r goes to zero, C2 should go to zero\nand, for general distributions, we express this conclusion as C2 \u221d rD2 . The exponent D2\nis called the correlation dimension and it is necessarily \u2264 3 for an embedding space of\ndimension three. When D2 is not an integer, the distribution is called fractal (Mandelbrot, 1982) and, in that case, the density, n(r) \u221d N /R3 \u221d rD2 \u22123 , has a singularity, as\nmentioned above.\n\n\fR. Thieberger & E.A. Spiegel\n\nAs with correlation functions, it is possible to study higher order statistics. To generalize the correlation integral formalism, one introduces (Paladin and Vulpiani 1987)\n1\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9q\u22121 \uf8f6 q\u22121\nX\nX\n\uf8ec1\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f0 1\nCq (r) = \uf8ed\n,\n\u0398(r \u2212 |Xi \u2212 Xj |)\uf8fb \uf8f8\nN i\nN \u22121\n\n\uf8eb\n\n(2.2)\n\nj6=i\n\nwhere q is a parameter that defines the order of the moment. For q = 2, a two-point\nprobability (second-order moment) is evaluated and the standard correlation integral is\nrecovered. For any integer value of q, Cq (r) is the fraction of q-tuples in the set whose\nmembers lie within a distance r of one another. For sufficiently small r, Cq will go to\nzero for q > 1 and, for a typically well-behaved set, it will vanish like rDq , where the\nindex Dq is called a generalized or Renyi dimension (Renyi 1970, Halsey et al. 1986).\nA fractal whose dimensions are all the same (Dq independent of q) is called a homogeneous fractal, or monofractal. The more general cases with Dq depending on q are called\nmultifractals. Some authors reserve the term fractal for the special case of a monofractal\nbut, as mentioned at the outset, we here retain the general sense of the term, with the\nmultifractal as a particular case. For small r, in leading order, a plot of log Cq versus\nlog r is approximately linear and the slope is Dq . The dimensions are therefore easily\nfound if the data are adequate, which may not be the case for the three-dimensional\ndistribution of galaxies. Some hints of the next term in the expansion for small r -\nthe lacunarity function (Thieberger et al., 1990) - have been found for the galaxy distribution (Provenzale et al., 1997), though it has yet to be confirmed that the observed\nfluctuations about the linear plot are intrinsic to the geometrical distribution of galaxies.\n3. Projecting Fractals\nHaving dealt with the polemical and pedagogical aspects of this problem, we may\nnow turn to our basic question: how are the fractal properties of a distribution of points\nin three-dimensional space transformed by projection of the set onto a subspace like the\ncelestial sphere? The main features of this question can already be seen in projecting\nfrom two dimensions into one dimension and, as this version of the problem is more\neconomical of computing resources, we adopt it here for our illustrative examples. The\nwork for the full case of projection from three dimensions is very much the same, as\nwe have verified by performing a few explicit tests. By way of introduction to these\nproblems the reader may wish to look at the analytic study of a specific case, performed\nby Mandelbrot (1975; see also Dogterom and Pietronero, 1991).\nBefore describing results obtained with actual examples, we recall some of the relevant\nmathematical theorems. As in most sciences, we must then face the uncomfortable gap\nthat arises between theory and practice because the quantities most easily measured,\nhere the Dq , for q > 1, are not those that conform best to mathematical usage. For the\nsimplest systems, that is for the monofractals for which Dq is independent of q, these\ndistinctions do not arise, while for most practical cases they are slight. So we shall not\nenter here into the details; these are discussed in Beck and Schloegl (1993), for example.\nAn empirically useful characterization of a set of points is by way of its fractal dimension D evaluated in a space of dimension D. To define this, we first find the smallest\n\n\fProjection of Fractals and the Distribution of Galaxies\n\nnumber of balls - the mathematician's word for the interiors of spheres of dimension\nD - of diameter l that are needed to cover all the points. As l \u2192 0, this number will\nvary like l\u2212D . The quantity D is the fractal dimension of the set of points; it is also\ncalled the box-counting dimension and it is almost always the same as D0 . Computing\nit from data is less reliable than determining D2 but, if we know the recipe by which a\nmathematically conceived set is constructed, it is not difficult to find the exact values of\nD0 and to compare them with those determined from the exponents found by the use of\ncorrelation functions (Thieberger, et al.. 1990).\nFor subtle reasons, for some sets that we will rarely encounter in real life, the boxcounting procedure just described may not work and so the definition may be relaxed to\nallow balls of all sizes in a covering of the set by balls. For each such generalized covering,\nan effective dimension may be obtained and the least upper bound of these is called the\nHausdorff dimension, DH . It may be shown that DH \u2264 D0 . The Hausdorff dimension\nis the one that many mathematicians work with and, of course, they also prefer to be\nmore precise in defining it. However, we almost never need to distinguish DH from D0\n(Mainieri, 1993), which has an intuitive appeal and brings us closer to the way that de\nVaucouleurs (1970) thought about these things than to the more conventional statistical\ntreatments of galaxy distributions. (When asked how he happened to employ such a\nseemingly mathematical approach, de Vaucouleurs (private communication) explained\nthat this was simply what he had observed in the sky.) Although many of the theorems\nabout fractal sets are stated in terms of the Hausdorff dimension, Sauer and Yorke\n(1995) showed that the theorems which apply to Hausdorff dimension apply also to\nthe correlation dimension, which may be shown to be a lower bound on the Hausdorff\ndimension.\nSince the actual examples we study here concern solely projections from a twodimensional point set onto a one-dimensional space such as a line or a circle, we denote\nthe original set by S2 and the projected set by S1. Then we inquire into what can be\nsaid about the relation between these two sets.\nGenerally speaking, one finds that Dh (S1) = 1, if Dh (S2) > 1, and that Dh (S1) =\nDh (S2), if Dh (S2) < 1, as might have been expected intuitively. The theorems on which\nthis rough summary is based were already proven by Besicovitch (1939). Moreover,\nRadons (1993) has shown that, if D\u221e (S2) < 1, not all Dq (S1) are the same for different\nq. Hunt et al. (1997) proved a theorem whose relevant part for us is that, under almost all\nlinear transformations, from two dimensions to one dimension, D2 (S1) = min[1, D2 (S2)].\nIn their paper, they give a nonpathological example showing that for q > 2 an analogous\nequality does not hold.\nThough the results just outlined as representing the theory of the projection of fractals\nsuggest how well-developed that theory is, we must stress that it typically applies only\nwhen very large numbers of points are involved. Since it is sometimes true that the results\nof asymptotic treatments do not accurately reflect the outcome of a real situation with\na finite number of points in the set, we have carried out some explicit examples of the\neffects of projection on point sets. We now describe these. In choosing such examples, we\nmust be aware that projection onto a circle and onto a plane are fundamentally different.\nWhen we project onto a plane here, we do it unidirectionally, while our projections onto\nthe unit circle will be along radii extending from the center. These differences demand\n\n\fR. Thieberger & E.A. Spiegel\n\nspecial care in the numerical work. The sectors used in the projections onto the circle\nmust be such that a high enough density of points is encountered in each if we are to\nobtain reproducible results. And, in comparing different cases, one should take care to\nuse the same angles of projection.\nTo check on our procedures, we have verified that in projecting homogeneous twodimensional sets onto lines we obtain the theoretical results to good accuracy, even for a\nsample of moderate size. For fractals, however, the situation is more complicated and to\nstandardize the procedures we have worked with Cantor fractals constructed as follows.\nWe first make a Cantor set by decimation. That is, from the unit interval [0, 1] we\nremove the open set ( a1 , 1 \u2212 a1 ), where a > 1. This leaves the two outer segments [0, a1 ]\nand [1 \u2212 a1 , 1]. The choice of the parameter a, which is 3 for the standard Cantor set, is\nleft open for the moment. A fractal set is then constructed by repeating the procedure\non the two remaining segments and continuing in this way with each of the remaining\nsegments in successive generations. The result is a monofractal whose Dq is log 2/ log a\nfor all q.\nTo construct a two-dimensional fractal we formed the Cartesian product of two onedimensional fractals, each with its own value of a. We designate the set constructed in\nthis way as S2 = (a1 , a2 ). Such composite sets are also monofractals whose dimension is\nthe sum of those of the two Cantorial sets (Falconer,1990):\nD(S2) =\n\nln 2\nln 2\n+\n.\nln a1\nln a2\n\n(3.1)\n\nThis fractal typically produces a different fractal dimension according to the line on which\nit is projected.\nOur calculations on these sets were performed using a procedure called iterated function schemes (Barnsley, 1988). Results for the projection of three such multiplicative\nfractal sets are presented in the following two tables. In Table 1, we give the projected\ndimensions for the three sets, designated (a1 , a2 ), chosen to illustrate the projection effects for cases with small, medium and large values of D(S2). In this table we also show\nthat projections onto a circle or onto a (generic) line give, to good approximation, the\nsame results, though care was taken to chose the appropriate angles.\nFor the smallest number of points used in our analysis, we performed the calculations\nwith many different angles to limit our sample. Because of the nature of projecting\nonto a circle, we obtained different projected dimensions for different sets of angles. We\nthen selected that set which gave us the largest dimension. By using this procedure we\neliminate problematic regions (i.e. sparse regions) in our projection. We then adopted\nthis set of angles for the remainder of our calculations.\nIn Table 2, we show the convergence of the dimensions with increasing numbers of\npoints in the set, for the case of D2 . In seeking convergence, we doubled the number of\npoints when going from one line to the next. Our results indicate that for the fractal S2 =\n(6.54, 3.) we do not get the value of two for D(S1) as suggested in the aforementioned\nwork of Hunt et al. (1997). Of course, we are dealing with finite sets and, from these, it\nis not clear that we can achieve convergence to the value predicted by theory. We also\ngive in Table 2 the cases of projecting a line and projecting a homogeneous (randomly\n\n\fProjection of Fractals and the Distribution of Galaxies\n\ndistributed) two-dimensional set on a circle. It is interesting that we cannot distinguish\nbetween the results of these two projections.\nTable 1: The Projected Dimensions.\nSet\nDth\nD2\nD4\nD6\n(6.54,3.)\n(6.54,3.)*\n(15.,14.)\n(3.,2.68)\n*This case\nN\n15\n30\n60\n120\n*The\n\n1.000\n0.89\n1.000\n0.88\n0.519\n0.52\n1.334\n0.98\nis projection on a\n\n0.86\n0.83\n0.50\n0.98\nline.\n\n0.84\n0.79\n0.50\n0.97\n\nN\n\n62000\n62000\n58000\n58000\n\nTable 2: Variation of the calculated D2 with N.*\n(6.54,3.)\n(15.,14.)\n(3.,2.68\nline\n2D random\n.876\u00b1.007\n.520\u00b1.007\n.883\u00b1.003\n.519\u00b1.002\n.885\u00b1.003\n.519\u00b1.002\n.888\u00b1.001\n.518\u00b1.002\nnumber of points,N, is given\n\n.969\u00b1.003\n.978\u00b1.002\n.984\u00b1.001\n.987\u00b1.001\nin thousands\n\n.972\u00b1.001\n.985\u00b1.001\n.993\u00b1.001\n.996\u00b1.001\n\n.975\u00b1.002\n.987\u00b1.001\n.993\u00b1.001\n.996\u00b1.001\n\n4. Luminosity effects.\nIn considering the distribution on the celestial sphere of galaxies or of radio sources\nthe role of the intrinsic luminosities of the observed objects must be allowed for (Maurogordato and Lachi\u00e8ze-Rey, 1991). Such effects appear in N (> f ), the number of galaxies\ndetected whose flux density exceeds a given value, f (Peebles, 1993). This function is\na more reliable indicator of the dimension of the set under study than the dimension\nobtained directly from projection without regard to luminosity effects.\nAs is often done in first approximation in the stellar case, we assume that the luminosity function of the objects in our study is independent of position and of time. Though\nsuch dependences (especially the latter) may be important and ought to be included in\nmore advanced studies, they involve uncertainties and, in any case, we prefer to take\nthings one at a time as we learn how the various influences make themselves felt.\nThen, for a homogeneous distribution of galaxies with no evolution, we have (Peebles,\n1993)\nN (> f ) = Kf \u22121.5 .\n\n(4.1)\n\nThe constant, K, in this relation incorporates the luminosity function, which for galaxies,\nis often chosen to be the function (Schechter, 1976),\n\u03c3 \u221d w\u03b1 exp (\u2212w)\n\n(4.2)\n\nwhere w = L/L\u2217 , L is the luminosity, L\u2217 is some characteristic luminosity and obervations give \u03b1 = \u22121.07 \u00b1 0.05.\nEquation (4.1) is the consequence of integrating all the points over the range from\nzero to infinity. In that case, the value of \u03b1 influences only the constant and not the\n\n\fR. Thieberger & E.A. Spiegel\n\npower of f in (4.1). In the case where one can write down the fractal distribution in the\nsame way as the homogeneous one, the equation becomes (Peebles, 1993)\nN (> f ) = kf \u2212\u03b2 .\n\n(4.3)\n\nwhere \u03b2 can be approximated by D2 /2. The derivation is approximate and does not allow\nfor lacunarity oscillations (Provenzale et al., 1997) that are washed out in projection\naccording to Durrer et al. (1997).\nIn the calculations described here, we project a two dimensional space onto a onedimensional one. We nevertheless keep the same luminosity versus distance law as for\nthe three dimensional case, namely\nf=\n\nL\n.\n4\u03c0r2\n\n(4.4)\n\nTherefore, instead of eq. (4.1), we obtain the form\nN (> f ) = Kf \u22121 .\n\n(4.5)\n\nWe also consider the case of projecting a line onto a circle. To explain the results\nin this case, we have to go into more detail concerning how one obtains the equations.\nAccording to Peebles (1993) we can write\nN (> f ) =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nr2 dr\u03c8(Ar2 f )\n\n(4.6)\n\n0\n\nwhere\n\u03c8(x) = n\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nw\u03b1 exp\u2212w dw\n\n(4.7)\n\nx\n\nand \u03b1 is the exponent from Eq. (4.2).\nIn the case of the projection of a line, where the variation in r is not very large (for\nexample, for the case of Table 2: 84 > r > 71), the limits will depend on f. Therefore we\ncannot assume that we can incorporate the luminosity function into K as in the other\ncases. Now K will depend on the luminosity function, that is, on the value of \u03b1.\nTo illustrate our point let us assume that we could approximate the different r values\nby their means. Then we could introduce a \u03b4-function into the integral with argument\n(r \u2212 rm ) so that\nN (> f ) =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n2\nrdr\u03b4(r \u2212 rm )\u03c8(Af r2 ) = rm \u03c8(Af rm\n).\n\n(4.8)\n\n0\n\nThus we can expect the power of f to be influenced by \u03b1, as confirmed by our numerical\ncalculations. It is therefore convenient to write\nN (> f ) = const. f \u03b2\n\n(4.9)\n\n\fProjection of Fractals and the Distribution of Galaxies\n\nand to evaluate the parameters in this expression from the calculations.\nSet type\nrandom\nrandom\nrandom\nrandom\ncantor\ncantor\ncantor\ncantor\n\nTable 3: Dependence of N (> f ) on f .\nSpecification\nDth\n\u03b2th\n\u03b2cal\n2D\n2D\n1D\n1D\n(6.54,3.)\n(6.54,3.)\n(4.7,2.7)\n(7.,4.)\n\n2.00000\n2.00000\n1.00000\n1.00000\n1.00003\n1.00003\n1.14575\n0.85621\n\n-1.000\n-1.000\n-\n-\n-0.500\n-0.500\n-0.573\n-0.428\n\n-0.99\u00b10.01\n-1.00\u00b10.01\n-2.0\u00b10.1\n-2.7\u00b10.1\n-0.51\u00b10.03\n-0.51\u00b10.02\n-0.57\u00b10.02\n-0.41\u00b10.05\n\n\u03b1\n-1.25\n-3.25\n-1.25\n-3.25\n-1.25\n-3.25\n-1.25\n-1.25\n\nIn Table 3, we compare the \u03b2 obtained for the different sets on which we performed\nour calculations. The values are obtained by least square fit of N (> f ) for different f\nvalues. As f increases, the number of rejected points increases. The higher the rmax\nthe fewer retained points remain out of a given sample. The larger f , the steeper this\ndecrease is. In the calculations used for Table 3, we kept the number of projected points\nat the constant value of 40000 throughout by appropriately increasing the number of\npoints processed as the number of rejected points rose. Even a smaller sample gives\nquite reasonable results.\nAs our Rmax is perforce finite, we have to take care not to include too small values\nof f . If this point is ignored we obtain a more complicated dependence of N (> f ) on f .\nTo get the appropriate range where Rmax does not influence the results, we look for the\nR for which almost no projected points reach the unit circle, for a given f . Only those f\nthat are not eliminated because of Rmax are then included in the calculations. We also\nexamined the influence of the results on \u03b1 (Eq. (4.2)). As might be expected, \u03b1 does\nnot influence the results except in the case of projecting a line onto a circle. Our results\nare in good agreement with the analysis described by Peebles (1993).\n5. Conclusion\nWe conclude that extensive two-dimensional catalogues of extraterrestrial objects can\nreveal more about the statistics of these objects than may have been supposed. We\nhave illustrated the possibilities with a simple exercise in fractal projection that shows\nhow the existing mathematical results on this subject may be brought to bear on the\nstudy of large-scale structure. Though we have included only one feature not explicitly\nmentioned in most mathematical studies, namely the luminosity distribution, we see\nalready the emergence of an interesting aspect of the projection process. To appreciate\nthe usefulness of this result, we should recall that, in the projection of a homogeneous\n(or randomly distributed) set, there is no real difference in the dimension between the\noriginal and the projected dimension once the change in embedding dimension is allowed\nfor. However, if a suitable luminosity function is folded into the projection process,\npronounced differences emerge. This makes it possible to distinguish among sets with\ndifferent dimensions after projection through the influence of the luminosity function.\n\n\fR. Thieberger & E.A. Spiegel\n\nThus even when plentiful three-dimensional data become available, projection effects\nwill be worth studying since they avoid some of the problems in the measurement and\ninterpretation of redshifts, while still revealing the influence of the luminosity function.\nFor example, the three regimes mentioned in Murante et al. (1998), give appreciably\ndifferent results on projection if the luminosity effects are included. It is also possible to\ninclude the effects of source evolution or of galaxy merger by making the parameters in\nthe Schechter distribution time-dependent.\nIn conclusion, we thank Antonello Provenzale for his critical reading of the manuscript.\nWe are also grateful to S. Bhavsar, I. Grenier J. Yorke for for providing some references.\nE.A.S. would like to express his gratitude to the Tata Institute for Fundamental Research for hospitality in March, 1999 with special thanks to Kumar Chitre for his many\nkindnesses during that visit.\nReferences\nBarnsley M.F., 1988, Fractals Everywhere, Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA.\nBesicovitch A.S., 1939, Math.
