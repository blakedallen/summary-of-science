We investigate various topological spaces and varieties which can\nbe associated to a block of a finite group scheme G. These spaces come from\nthe theory of cohomological support varieties for modules, as well as from the\nrepresentation-theoretic constructions of E. Friedlander and J. Pevtsova.\n\nLet G be a finite group scheme over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic p > 0, and let k[G] denote the coordinate algebra (or representing algebra) of\nG. The algebra k[G] is a finite dimensional commutative Hopf algebra, and representations of G are equivalent to right co-modules for k[G], which in turn are\nequivalent to left modules of the \"group algebra\" kG := Homk (k[G], k). As kG\nis finite dimensional, it can be decomposed uniquely as an algebra into the direct\nproduct of its indecomposable two-sided ideals called the blocks of kG. Any kGmodule breaks up as the direct sum of modules which lie in a block, reducing the\nstudy of kG-mod to the study of the module categories of its blocks.\nIn the case that G is a finite group, the representation theory of a block is\ngoverned to a certain extent by its defect group, which is a particular p-subgroup\nof G unique up to conjugacy. Thus it would seem desirable to study the blocks of\na finite group scheme by adapting the theory of defect groups to this more general\nsetting, with unipotent subgroup schemes filling the role of p-subgroups. However,\nkey features of p-subgroups not shared by arbitrary unipotent subgroup schemes\nseem to stand in the way of making such a generalization. Another obstacle is\npresented by the work of R. Farnsteiner and A. Skowro\u0144ski in [8], where they prove\nthat for an arbitrary finite group scheme, the principal block is not always the\nblock with the most complicated representation type. This is a divergence from the\nwell-known situation for group algebras of finite groups, and gives some indication\nthat extending the theory of defect groups to all finite group schemes either might\nnot be possible, or at the very least will behave rather differently.\nEven without a generalized defect theory, developments over the last several\nyears in the theory of support varieties for modules of finite group schemes has led\nto new means by which blocks can be studied. Fundamental to the considerations\nin this paper is the work of E. Friedlander and J. Pevtsova in [10], in which they\ndefined for a finite group scheme G the \"representation-theoretic\" topological space\nof p-points P (G), and proved that this space is homeomorphic to the projective\nvariety of the cohomology ring H\u2022 (G, k). Their work not only extended to modules\nof finite group schemes many of the properties of support varieties known to be\ntrue for modules of finite groups, but the creation of p-points has also led to new\nand interesting module invariants (see, for example, [4], [12], [13], and [14]). As it\nrelates to blocks, one important application of [10] was given by Farnsteiner, who\n2010 Mathematics Subject Classification. 16E40, 16T99.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nPAUL SOBAJE\n\nproved in [7] that support varieties can be used to determine if a block has wild\nrepresentation type. Specifically, let VG (B) denote the union of the support varieties\nof all simple modules lying in a block B. Farnsteiner proved that if dimVG (B) \u2265 3,\nthen B has wild representation type.\nIn this paper we make some investigations into various support spaces of blocks.\nAfter quickly recalling relevant background material and setting our notation in the\nfirst section, in Section 2 we consider for a block B the variety VG (B) as defined\nabove. We show in Theorem 2.5 that by taking B to be a kG-module under\nthe \"left-adjoint\" action, there is an equality of varieties VG (B) = VG (B). We\nalso demonstrate that there is an indecomposable summand M of B such that\nVG (B) = VG (M ), and deduce using a theorem of J. Carlson [3] that the projective\nvariety Proj VG (B) is connected.\nIn Section 3, we look at how VG (B) compares with the variety XB defined using\nthe Hochschild cohomology ring of B. This question is motivated by work done for\nfinite groups by M. Linckelmann in [18] and [19]. We prove in Proposition 3.1 that\nthere is a finite surjective morphism of varieties XB \u2192 VG (B). This result follows\nas an easy consequence of the results in the previous section. We prove that for\nthe principal block B0 of kG, there is an isomorphism of varieties XB0 \u223c\n= VG (B0 ),\nprovided that either B0 is local, or that the complexity of the trivial module is \u2264 1.\nThe motivation behind the comparison of XB and VG (B) is that XB is defined\nonly in terms of B and hence is a true invariant of B, as opposed to VG (B) whose\ndefinition involves the group algebra in which B is a summand. In Section\n4, we look\nS\nat this question from the perspective of p-points. We set P (G)B = P (G)Si , for all\nsimple modules lying in B, and compare this to the space of flat-points of B, denoted\nF (B), which is defined by taking flat maps from k[t]/(tp ) to B (our notation and\ndefinition are slightly modified from the definition of a flat-point given in [6]). The\nprojection map from kG onto the block B defines a map from P (G)B to F (B), which\nwe show in Proposition 4.4 to be injective. We also show, as a sort of analogue to a\nresult in Section 3, that if B0 is the principal block of kG, and if the trivial module is\nthe only simple B0 -module, then there is a homeomorphism P (G)B0 \u223c\n= F (B0 ). The\nmain step in proving this comes in Theorem 4.7, which shows that if G is a unipotent\nfinite group scheme, then every flat map k[t]/(tp ) \u2192 kG is equivalent to one which\nfactors through an abelian subgroup scheme (under the equivalence defined on such\nmaps in [10]). This implies that, in terms of providing a representation-theoretic\ntopological space which is homeomorphic to Proj H\u2022 (G, k), the definition of a ppoint could effectively drop the word \"abelian\" from its factorization requirement.\nWe note however that we are unaware at this point how such an alteration in\ndefinition would affect other theories coming from p-points, such as modules of\n\"constant Jordan type\" (see [4]).\n0.1.

We would also like to thank Sarah Witherspoon for\n\n\fMODULE INVARIANTS AND BLOCKS OF FINITE GROUP SCHEMES\n\n3\n\nclarifying conversations about Hochschild cohomology for Hopf algebras. Finally,\nwe thank the referee for many helpful comments and observations.\n1. Notation and Recollections\nWe will assume throughout that k is an algebraically closed field of characteristic\np > 0. Unless specified, tensor products are assumed to be over k. If G is a\nfinite group scheme over k, we write its coordinate ring as k[G], and define kG :=\nHomk (k[G], k). Following the terminology of [10], we call kG the group algebra of\nG. It is a finite dimensional cocommutative Hopf algebra with comultiplication\n\u2206, counit \u01eb, and antipode s. The category kG-mod of finitely generated left kGmodules is equivalent to the category of finitely generated representations of G,\nand thus we will speak of the two interchangeably. As an algebra, kG is a direct\nproduct of its indecomposable two-sided ideals, which we call the blocks of kG, and\nwrite as kG = B0 + * * * + Br . By ei we denote the central idempotent of Bi , so that\nBi = kGei . A kG-module M is said to lie in the block Bi if ei acts as the identity\nmap on M . In the above decomposition of kG, the block B0 will always denote the\nprincipal block of kG; it is the block in which the trivial module k lies.\nFor a kG-module M , the cohomology groups Hi (G, M ) are defined to be the\ngroups ExtikG (k, M ). We set\n\u2022\n\nH (G, k) =\n\n(L\n\nHi (G, k)\n2i\ni\u22650 H (G, k)\n\nLi\u22650\n\nif char k = 2\nif char k 6= 2\n\nIt is a finitely generated commutative algebra over k ([15, 1.1]), and and we denote\nby VG the maximal ideal spectrum of H\u2022 (G, k).\nFollowing the notation and terminology in [2], for M, N \u2208 kG-mod, IG (M, N )\ndenotes the annihilator in H\u2022 (G, k) of Ext\u2217 (M, N ) as a module given by the cup\nproduct. Equivalently, this is the annihilator of the module H\u2217 (G, Homk (M, N )).\nThe relative support variety VG (M, N ) is then the set of maximal ideals in VG\nwhich contain IG (M, N ).\nIf N = M , we simply write IG (M ) and VG (M ), and call VG (M ) the support\nvariety of M . Note that in this case, IG (M ) can be given as the kernel of the map\nof graded algebras from H\u2022 (G, k) to H\u2022 (G, Homk (M, M )), this map induced by the\ninclusion k \u0592\u2192 Homk (M, M ). See [10, 1.5, 5.6] for a list of properties satisfied by\nsupport varieties for modules of finite group schemes.\nFor an algebra A we denote by HHi (A) the i-th Hochschild cohomology group of\nA with coefficients in A, and define the group by HHi (A) := ExtiA\u2297Aop (A, A), where\nA is a left A \u2297 Aop -module in the usual way. If \u03b61 \u2208 HHn (A), and \u03b62 \u2208 HHm (A),\nthen by regarding these as n-fold and m-fold extensions of A by A respectively,\nwe can tensor over A to obtain an (n + m)-fold extension \u03b61 \u2323 \u03b62 \u2208 HHn+m (A),\nand this gives the space HH\u2217 (A) the structure of an associative algebra, which\nwas shown to be graded-commutative by M. Gerstenhaber in [16]. Just as with\nH\u2022 (G, k), we denote by HH\u2022 (A) the even Hochschild cohomology ring.\nWe will later make use of the well-known fact that the decomposition of kG into\nblocks yields an algebra decomposition HH\u2022 (kG) \u223c\n= HH\u2022 (B0 ) \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 HH\u2022 (Br ).\n\n\f4\n\nPAUL SOBAJE\n\nA p-point [11] of a finite group scheme G is a map of algebras \u03b1 : k[t]/(tp ) \u2192 kG,\nsuch that:\n(1) \u03b1\u2217 (kG) is a projective k[t]/(tp )-module.\n(2) \u03b1 factors through a unipotent, abelian subgroup scheme of G.\nTwo p-points \u03b1 and \u03b2 are equivalent, written \u03b1 \u223c \u03b2, if \u03b1\u2217 (M ) projective \u21d0\u21d2\n\u03b2 \u2217 (M ) projective, for all M in kG-mod.\nBy P (G) we denote the set of all equivalence classes of p-points of G. For a kGmodule M , P (G)M is the set {[\u03b1] \u2208 P (G)| \u03b1\u2217 (M ) is not projective}. Declaring the\nclosed sets of P (G) to be all of the sets P (G)M , M \u2208 kG-mod, defines a Noetherian\ntopology on P (G) ([10, 3.10]), and the space P (G) with this topology is called\nthe space of p-points of G. This space provides a non-cohomological description of\nsupport varieties, as shown in the following theorem.\nTheorem 1.1. [10, 4.11] There is a homeomorphism\n\u223c\n\n\u03a8 : P (G) \u2192 Proj H\u2022 (G, k)\nsatisfying the property that\n\u03a8\u22121 (Proj VG (M )) = P (G)M .\nfor every finitely generated G-module M .\n2. The Variety VG (B)\nLet G be a finite group scheme with group algebra kG, and let B be a block of\nkG. There is a smallest closed subset of VG which contains VG (M ) for all M lying\nin B, which we will denote by VG (B). Basic properties of support varieties can be\nused to show that if {Si } is a complete set of non-isomorphic simple B-modules,\nthen\n[\nVG (Si )\nVG (B) =\ni\n\nS\n\nSimilarly, we can define P (G)B := P (G)M , the union being over all modules\nM lying in B. By Theorem 1.1, P (G)B \u223c\n= Proj VG (B).\nThe usefulness of these spaces can be seen in this next theorem due to Farnsteiner.\nTheorem 2.1. [7, 3.1] Let B be a block of a finite group scheme G.\n(1) dim VG (B) = 0 if and only if B is a simple algebra.\n(2) If dim VG (B) \u2265 2, then B has infinite representation type.\n(3) If dim VG (B) \u2265 3, then B has wild representation type.\nRemark 2.2. The theorem referenced from [7] proves (3), but we have included\nthe other two cases for completeness. Part (1) is immediate given the properties\nof support varieties, and (2) follows from a result of Heller [17] for self-injective\nalgebras having finite representation type.\nThe use of B in our notation above is to indicate that we are not considering the\nsupport variety of the module B as a summand of the left regular representation, as\nthis variety is always just a single point. We can however consider B as a module\n\n\fMODULE INVARIANTS AND BLOCKS OF FINITE GROUP SCHEMES\n\n5\n\nunder the\nP left-adjoint action of kG. Recall that for x \u2208 kG, b \u2208 B, and writing\n\u2206(x) = x(1) \u2297 x(2) , the left-adjoint action is given by\nX\nx.b =\nx(1) bs(x(2) )\n\nWith this action, B is a G-algebra. That is, the multiplication map m : B \u2297 B \u2192\nB is a map of kG-modules. From this point on, any reference to B as a kG-module\nwill assume it is given by the left-adjoint action. The module B does not in general\nlie in the block B (for instance the trivial module is a composition factor), however\nas our next result shows, VG (B) is equal to VG (B).\nWe first establish a few lemmas in order to simplify the proof. Recall that for\na module M , the fixed points of M , denoted M G , are those m \u2208 M such that\nx.m = \u01eb(x)m.\nLemma 2.3. The fixed points of B are precisely the elements in the center of B.\nP\nP\nProof. If b \u2208 Z(B), then x.b =\nx(1) bs(x(2) ) =\nx(1) s(x(2) )bP= \u01eb(x)b. Conversely,\nif\ny.b\n=\n\u01eb(y)b\nfor\nall\ny\n\u2208\nkG,\nthen\nwe\nhave\nxb =\nx(1) \u01eb(x(2) )b =\nP\nx(1) b\u01eb(x(2) ), which by coassociativity and the definition of the antipode we can\nP\nexpress as\nx(1)P\nbs(x(2) )x(3) . In view of the fact that b \u2208 B G , this is then equal to\nP\n\u01eb(x(1) )bx(2) = b\u01eb(x(1) )x(2) = bx.\n\u0003\nLemma 2.4. Let A be a finite dimensional G-algebra. Then IG (A) = IG (k, A);\ntherefore VG (A) = VG (k, A)\n\nProof. The action of H\u2022 (G, k) on Ext\u2217kG (A, A) via the cup product factors as the algebra map H\u2022 (G, k) \u2192 H\u2217 (G, A) followed by the action H\u2217 (G, A) \u2297 Ext\u2217kG (A, A) \u2192\nExt\u2217kG (A, A\u2297A) \u2192 Ext\u2217kG (A, A), the last map induced by the multiplication map of\nA. Thus IG (k, A) \u2286 IG (A). On the other hand, as shown in [2, 5.7] (and the same\narguments holding for finite group schemes), the inclusion IG (A) \u2286 IG (k, A) follows from the cup product of H\u2022 (G, k) on H\u2217 (G, A) factoring through Ext\u2217kG (A, A)\nacting via the Yoneda product on H\u2217 (G, A).\n\u0003\nTheorem 2.5. Let B be a block of kG. With the left-adjoint action of kG on B,\nwe have\n(1) VG (B) = VG (B).\n(2) VG (B) = VG (M ), for M some indecomposable summand of B. In particular, the projective variety Proj VG (B) is connected.\nProof. If M is any module lying in B, then the map of G-algebras k \u2192 Homk (M, M )\nfactors as k \u2192 B \u2192 Homk (M, M ). Thus the map H\u2022 (G, k) \u2192 H\u2022 (G, Homk (M, M ))\nfactors through the map H\u2022 (G, k) \u2192 H\u2022 (G, B). We then have IG (k, B) \u2286 IG (M )\nfor all M \u2208 B-mod, so that VG (M ) \u2286 VG (k, B) for all M in B-mod. Hence\nVG (B) \u2286 VG (k, B).\nConversely, suppose that \u03b6 \u2208 IG (M ) for all M in B. In particular \u03b6 \u2208 IG (S) for\nall simple B-modules. The Jacobson radical of B, J(B),\nis a submodule of B, and\nL\nHom\nthere is an isomorphism of G-algebras B/J(B) \u223c\n=\nk (Si , Si ), for {Si } a set\nof non-isomorphic simple B-modules. In the composite of maps\nH\u2022 (G, k) \u2192 H\u2022 (G, B) \u2192 H\u2022 (G, B/J(B))\nit follows then that \u03b6 is sent to 0 \u2208 H\u2022 (G, B/J(B)). However, from the short exact\nsequence of modules\n\n\f6\n\nPAUL SOBAJE\n\n0 \u2192 J(B) \u2192 B \u2192 B/J(B) \u2192 0\nwe get a long exact sequence in cohomology, which in particular tells us that the\nkernel of the map H\u2022 (G, B) \u2192 H\u2022 (G, B/J(B)) is given by the image of the map\nH\u2022 (G, J(B)) \u2192 H\u2022 (G, B). As J(B) is a nilpotent ideal, this image is a nilpotent\nideal: if \u03b3 \u2208 H2i (G, B) can be represented by a map \u03a92i (k) \u2192 B whose image is\ncontained in J(B), then by the definition of the cup product, \u03b3 n can be represented\nby map \u03a92in (k) \u2192 B whose image is contained in the image of the map J(B)\u2297n \u2192\nJ(B), b1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 bn 7\u2192 b1 * * * bn . For large enough n this image is 0, and hence \u03b3 is\nnilpotent.\nThus, the image of the element \u03b6 in the map H\u2022 (G, k)S\u2192 H\u2022 (G, B) is nilpotent, so\nthat \u03b6 is in the radical of IG (k, B). Thus VG (k, B) \u2286 VG (S) = VG (B). Applying\nlemma 2.4, we get VG (B) = VG (B).\nFor the proof of (2), let B \u223c\n= M1 + * * * + Mn be a direct sum decomposition\ninto indecomposable submodules. The space of fixed points of B is equal to the\nsum of fixed spaces M1G + * * * + MnG . By lemma 2.3, B G = Z(B), which is a local\nalgebra, and so at least one Mi must contain the element e + z, where e is the\ncentral idempotent of B and z is central and nilpotent. For N any B-module, the\nmap f : Mi \u2297 N \u2192 N given by f (m \u2297 n) = mn is a well-defined map coming from\nthe action of B on N . It is a G-module map, since if x \u2208 kG, then\nX\nX\nf (x(m\u2297n)) = f (\nx(1) ms(x(2) )\u2297x(3) n) =\nx(1) ms(x(2) )x(3) n = xmn = xf (m\u2297n)\n\nP\nThere is also a map h : N \u2192 Mi \u2297 N given by h(n) = (e + z) \u2297 i\u22650 (\u2212z)i n,\nwhich is well-defined because z is nilpotent. Since e, z are central in B, then for\nx \u2208 kG we have\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nX\nX\nX\n\uf8ed\u01eb(x(1) )(e + z) \u2297 x(2) ( (\u2212z)i n)\uf8f8\n(e + z) \u2297 ( (\u2212z)i xn) =\ni\u22650\n\ni\u22650\n\nP\nThe right-hand sum is equal to x.((e + z) \u2297 ( i\u22650 (\u2212z)i n)), so that h is a Gmodule map. Since f \u25e6 h = idN , N is a summand of Mi \u2297 N . It follows that\nVG (N ) \u2286 VG (Mi ) for all modules lying in B, and hence VG (B) \u2286 VG (Mi ). By part\n(1), and the fact that Mi is a direct summand of B, this subset inclusion is actually\nan equality.\nThe connectedness of the variety Proj VG (Mi ) is given by Carlson's theorem\n[3] on indecomposable modules for finite groups, the proof of which applies to the\nsetting of finite group schemes.\n\u0003\nRemark 2.6. As pointed out to us by J. Pevtsova, part (1) in the above theorem\nis analogous to a result of A. Premet in the context of reduced enveloping algebras\n([21, 2.2]), although the two methods of proof are quite different.\nWe conclude this section by recording the relationship between the support variety of a block of a finite group, and the support coming from a defect group of\nthe block. We state the result for p-points, which simplifies one aspect of the proof.\nWe note that if G is any finite group scheme with closed subgroup scheme H, then\nthe inclusion H \u2286 G induces a natural map i : P (H) \u2192 P (G).\n\n\fMODULE INVARIANTS AND BLOCKS OF FINITE GROUP SCHEMES\n\n7\n\nProposition 2.7. Let G be a finite group, B a block of kG with defect group D,\nand let i : P (D) \u2192 P (G) be the natural map on p-support spaces. Then\nP (G)B = i(P (D)).\nProof. Since every module lying in B is the summand of a module induced from\nkD to kG, we have by [14, 4.12] that P (G)M \u2286 i(P (D)) for all modules M lying\nin B, and hence P (G)B \u2286 i(P (D)). On the other hand, there is some module\nM \u2032 lying in B which is a trivial source module and has vertex D [1, 6.3.3]. It\nfollows that the trivial module is a summand of M \u2032 when restricted to kD. If \u03b1 is\na p-point factoring through kD, then in view of the previous statement, we have\n\u0003\n[\u03b1] \u2208 P (G)M \u2032 \u2286 P (G)B . Thus, i(P (D)) \u2286 P (G)B .\n3. Comparison with Hochschild Cohomology\nLet XB be the maximal ideal spectrum of HH\u2022 (B). We will show that as an\neasy consequence of the results in the previous section, there is a finite surjective\nmorphism of varieties from XB to VG (B), and then proceed to show a few instances\nin which the two are isomorphic. But first we will recall how the cohomology ring\nof a finite group scheme and its Hochschild cohomology ring relate to each other,\nciting as we go the appendix of [20], which works these details out nicely for general\nfinite dimensional Hopf algebras.\nFollowing [20], denote by \u03b4 the composite of the maps (Id \u2297 s) \u25e6 \u2206. Then by [20,\n7.1, 7.2], \u03b4 defines an embedding of kG into kG \u2297 kGop such that\n(1) kG \u2297 kGop is a projective kG-module, kG acting via \u03b4\n(2) As kG \u2297 kGop -modules, kG \u223c\n= (kG \u2297 kGop ) \u2297\u03b4(kG) k\nAt the same time, the left-adjoint action of kG on itself is clearly just the restriction (via the embedding \u03b4) of the natural action of kG \u2297 kGop on kG. Thus,\nwe can apply the Eckmann-Shaprio isomorphism to get\ni\nHi (G, kG) = Exti (k, kG) \u223c\n= Exti\nop (kG, kG) = HH (kG)\nkG\n\nkG\u2297kG\n\nThis proves that there is an isomorphism of vector spaces H\u2217 (G, kG) \u223c\n= HH\u2217 (kG),\nand as proven in [20, 7.2], this is also an isomorphism of algebras. It is then straightforward to see that if B is a block of kG, it is a summand of kG as a kG \u2297 kGop module, and we have ExtikG (k, B) \u223c\n= ExtikG\u2297kGop (kG, B) \u223c\n= ExtiB\u2297B op (B, B), and\n\u2022\n\u2022\nconsequently, H (G, B) \u223c\n= HH (B).\nWith this isomorphism of algebras established, we have the following proposition.\nProposition 3.1. Let B be a block of a finite group scheme G. Then there is\na finite surjective morphism of varieties XB \u2192 VG (B). In particular, the Krull\ndimension of HH\u2022 (B) is equal to the dimension of the variety VG (B).\nProof. As just recalled, HH\u2022 (B) \u223c\n= H\u2022 (G, B), and the latter is a finite module over\n\u2022\nH (G, k) by a theorem of Friedlander and Suslin ([15, 1.1]). Thus, there is a finite\nsurjective morphism of varieties XB \u2192 VG (k, B). By Lemma 2.4 and Theorem 2.5,\nVG (k, B) = VG (B).\n\u0003\nWe next show that for certain principal blocks, there is an isomorphism, modulo\nnilpotent elements, between HH\u2022 (B0 ) and H\u2022 (G, k). For principal blocks of finite\ngroups, M. Linckelmann was able to prove in [19] a much stronger result, proving\nthat such an isomorphism holds in general. We also note that S. Siegel and S.\nWitherspoon had previously proved in [22] this result for finite p-groups (in which\n\n\f8\n\nPAUL SOBAJE\n\ncase the group algebra is the principal block), and their proof is essentially the same\nas will be given to prove the first part of the following theorem.\nTheorem 3.2. Let B0 be the principal block of a finite group scheme G. The rings\nHH\u2022 (B0 ) and H\u2022 (G, k) are isomorphic modulo nilpotent elements in the following\ncases:\n(1) If the trivial module is the only simple B0 -module.\n(2) If dim VG \u2264 1.\n\u223c\nProof. For the principal block B0 of any finite group scheme G, we have H\u2022 (G, B0 ) =\nH\u2022 (G, k) \u2295 H\u2022 (G, I), where k is the 1-dimensional vector space of B0 spanned by\nthe central idempotent, and I is the augmentation ideal of B0 . In the above decomposition, H\u2022 (G, k) is a subalgebra of H\u2022 (G, B0 ) and H\u2022 (G, I) is an ideal. Thus\nwe are ultimately interested in proving that H\u2022 (G, I) is nilpotent.\nUnder the assumption that the trivial module is the only simple B0 -module,\nwe have that I = Rad(B0 ), and is therefore a nilpotent ideal. Suppose now that\n\u03b6 \u2208 H\u2022 (G, I). Then \u03b6 n is in the image of the map H \u2022 (G, I \u2297n ) \u2192 H\u2022 (G, I), induced\nby multiplication in I, and by the nilpotence of I this map is 0 for large enough n.\nFor the proof of (2), if dim VG = 0, then this case is trivial since B0 \u223c\n= k, hence\nboth H\u2022 (G, B0 ) and HH\u2022 (B0 ) are isomorphic to k. If VG = 1, then it follows from\n[2, 5.10.4] (again the proof applying also to finite group schemes) that \u03a9n (k) \u223c\n=k\nfor some n. Let \u03b6 \u2208 H2i (G, I). The element \u03b6 n is represented by a map from\n\u03a92in (k) \u223c\n= k to I. Thus, \u03b6 n is represented by a map whose image lands both in the\naugmentation ideal I, and in the center of B0 by lemma 2.3. But the center of B0\nis local, and hence its intersection with the augmentation ideal is precisely the set\nof nilpotent central elements of B0 . It follows that \u03b6 nm = 0 for large enough m,\nand hence the ideal is nilpotent.\n\u0003\nCorollary 3.3. If B0 is the principal block of kG, and satisfies either of the hypotheses in the previous theorem, then XB0 \u223c\n= VG .\nWe now clarify the ramifications of a principal block having only one simple\nmodule, or equivalently, being a local k-algebra, as this hypothesis will again be\nused in the following section. First we recall that a finite group scheme H is called\nlinearly reductive if the group algebra kH is semisimple. We observe that if U is a\nunipotent finite group scheme, then the principal block of k(U \u00d7 H) is isomorphic\nas an algebra to kU , and thus is local. It has been pointed out to us by the referee\nthat the general case does not stray far from this example, as any G which has a\nlocal principal block must be an extension of a unipotent finite group scheme by a\nlinearly reductive group scheme. The following proposition provides a proof of this\nclaim, though it can also be deduced by applying results found in [5] and [9] (as\nfirst observed by the referee).\nProposition 3.4. Let B0 be the principal block of the finite group scheme G, and\nsuppose that B0 is local. Then there is a linearly reductive normal subgroup scheme\nN of G such that G/N is unipotent, and the canonical map kG \u2192 k(G/N ) induces\nan algebra isomorphism B0 \u223c\n= k(G/N ).\nProof. If the trivial module is the only simple module lying in the principal block,\nthen e0 \u2297 e0 is the unique non-zero idempotent of B0 \u2297 B0 . Suppose now that\nkG \u223c\n= B0 + * * * + Br , and let Bk , k 6= 0, be a block with central idempotent ek . We\n\n\fMODULE INVARIANTS AND BLOCKS OF FINITE GROUP SCHEMES\n\n9\n\nknow that \u2206(ek ) is an idempotent in kG \u2297 kG, an algebra whose blocks are of the\nform Bi \u2297 Bj , and so we must have\n\u2206(ek ) =\n\nX\n\nxij ,\n\nx2ij = xij \u2208 Bi \u2297 Bj\n\n0\u2264i,j\u2264r\n\nIf x00 = e0 \u2297 e0 , then (m \u25e6 (Id \u2297 \u01eb) \u25e6 \u2206)(ek ) 6= ek , thus x00 = 0. This then implies\nthat \u2206(Bk ) \u2286 kG \u2297 (B1 + * * * + Br ) + (B1 + * * * + Br ) \u2297 kG, so that B1 + * * * + Br is\na Hopf ideal of kG. Thus there is a normal subgroup scheme N of G for which the\nkernel of the canonical map kG \u2192 k(G/N ) is B1 + * * * + Br . This clearly implies\nthat k(G/N ) \u223c\n= B0 as an algebra, from which we deduce that G/N is unipotent.\nOn the other hand, the kernel of the projection kG \u2192 k(G/N ) is kGkN \u2020 , where\nkN \u2020 denotes the augmentation ideal of kN . It follows that kN \u2020 \u2286 B1 + * * * + Br .\nThus the image of kN in B0 under the composite of maps kN \u0592\u2192 kG \u0589 B0 is\none-dimensional. We then have that B0 , as a left-module over kN in the usual way\n(that is, as the restriction to kN of a summand of the left-regular representation\nof kG) is both projective and isomorphic to dimk (B0 ) copies of the trivial module.\nThus the trivial module is projective as a kN -module, which implies that kN is\nsemisimple.\n\u0003\nRemark 3.5. It follows from the results of [5, 1.1] that N must in fact be equal\nto the subgroup Glr , which is defined to be the unique largest linearly reductive\nnormal subgroup scheme of G.\n4. p-points and Block Invariants\nIn the last section we made some observations about the relationship between\nVG (B) and XB , the latter space defined intrinsically for B. Similarly, in this section\nwe will look at a space defined intrinsically for B and compare it with P (G)B . The\nfollowing definition is a slight modification above that given in [6].\nDefinition 4.1. Let B be a block of a finite group scheme G. A flat-point of B is\nan algebra map\n\u03b1 : k[t]/(tp ) \u2192 B\nsuch that \u03b1 is left-flat (i.e. \u03b1\u2217 (B) is a projective module). Two flat-points \u03b1, \u03b2 are\nsaid to be equivalent if for all B-modules M:\n\u03b1\u2217 (M ) proj. \u21d0\u21d2 \u03b2 \u2217 (M ) proj.\nWe then set F (B) to be the set of all equivalence classes [\u03b1] of flat-points of B\nsuch that there is a finitely generated B-module M with \u03b1\u2217 (M ) not projective. We\nalso define a topology on F (B) by taking the smallest topology such that the sets\n{[\u03b1] \u2208 F (B)|\u03b1\u2217 (M ) is not projective} are closed, for all M \u2208 B-mod.\nRemark 4.2. It is clear that F (B) is defined intrinsically for B. By contrast,\nP (G)B is not an invariant belonging to B since the definition of a p-point involves\nthe Hopf algebra structure of kG (due to the factorization through unipotent abelian\nsubgroup schemes).\nRemark 4.3. The definition in [6] is stated for an arbitrary algebra A, and the\nspace (denoted there as F l(A)) is given as the set of all equivalence classes of flat\nmaps from k[t]/(tp ) to A. We have chosen our definition in such a way that a block\n\n\f10\n\nPAUL SOBAJE\n\nwhich is simple as an algebra will always have F (B) = \u2205 (for example, if B is the\nblock of the Steinberg module for u(sl2 ), then F l(B) = {pt.}). Also, the definition\nin [6] does not specify a topology on the set of flat-points.\nIf B is a block of kG, then the projection map \u03c1 : kG \u2192 B is flat, and thus\nwe get a map from p-points of G to flat-points of B by composing with \u03c1. Also,\nif M is a kG-module which lies in B, then M is a B-module whose structure as a\nkG-module is given by the pull-back functor \u03c1\u2217 . Thus if \u03b1 is a p-point of G, then\n\u03c1 \u25e6 \u03b1 is a flat-point of B, and the k[t]/(tp )-modules \u03b1\u2217 (M ) and (\u03c1 \u25e6 \u03b1)\u2217 (M ) are the\nsame, since the definition of M as a kG-module effectively involved pull-back by \u03c1\nin the first place. We see then that the map \u03c1\u2217 : P (G) \u2192 F (B) is well-defined on\nequivalence classes of p-points, as the equivalence relation for flat-points is defined\nin the exact same manner as for p-points, but only considers modules lying in B\nrather than all kG-modules. To distinguish between equivalence classes in P (G)\nand F (B), we will write [\u03b1]G and [\u03b2]B respectively.\nRestricting the above map to the support space of the block, we get a map\nP (G)B \u2192 F (B). We now show that this map is both injective and continuous.\nProposition 4.4. Let B be a block of a finite group scheme kG, and let \u03c1 denote\nthe projection kG \u2192 B. The map \u03c1\u2217 : P (G)B \u2192 F (B), which sends [\u03b1]G to [\u03c1\u25e6\u03b1]B ,\nis injective and continuous.\nProof. Suppose that [\u03b1]G , [\u03b2]G \u2208 P (G)B , with [\u03b1]G 6= [\u03b2]G . By [10, 5.1], the\ninequivalence of \u03b1 and \u03b2 as p-points implies that there exists a cohomology class\n\u03b6 in degree 2n, for some n, such that the Carlson module L\u03b6 restricts via \u03b1 to a\nnon-projective k[t]/(tp )-module, while the restriction via \u03b2 is projective. In other\nwords, [\u03b1]G \u2208LP (G)L\u03b6 and [\u03b2]G 6\u2208 P (G)L\u03b6 .\nLet M =\nSi , for all simple modules Si lying in B, so that P (G)B = P (G)M .\nBy [10, 5.6], we have\n(1)\n\n[\u03b1]G \u2208 P (G)L\u03b6 \u2297M , [\u03b2]G 6\u2208 P (G)L\u03b6 \u2297M\n\nLet e be the central idempotent of B. The module L\u03b6 \u2297 M can be decomposed\ninto the sum of e.(L\u03b6 \u2297 M ) and (1 \u2212 e).(L\u03b6 \u2297 M ). As shown in the proof of [7, 2.2],\nsince M is a B-module, (1 \u2212 e).(L\u03b6 \u2297 M ) is projective, hence all of the support of\nL\u03b6 \u2297 M comes from e.(L\u03b6 \u2297 M ). With this observation, (1) then can be restated\nas:\n[\u03b1]G \u2208 P (G)e.(L\u03b6 \u2297M) , [\u03b2]G 6\u2208 P (G)e.(L\u03b6 \u2297M)\nSince e.(L\u03b6 \u2297 M ) lies in B, then as observed above the action of kG factors\nthrough B so that \u03b1\u2217 (e.(L\u03b6 \u2297 M )) = (\u03c1\u25e6 \u03b1)\u2217 (e.(L\u03b6 \u2297 M )), and so we have [\u03c1\u25e6 \u03b1]B 6=\n[\u03c1 \u25e6 \u03b2]B .\nAs for the continuity of \u03c1\u2217 , for a B-module M we see that (\u03c1\u2217 )\u22121 (F (B)M ) =\nP (G)M , which is a closed set in P (G)B . Since the topology on F (B) is specified\nas being the smallest such that the F (B)M are closed sets, the continuity of \u03c1\u2217\nfollows.\n\u0003\nWe will show that, in analogy with Theorem 3.2(1), for principal blocks having\na single simple module, the map \u03c1\u2217 : P (G)B0 \u2192 F (B0 ) is a homeomorphism. We\nfirst recall the following lemma which will be useful in the next theorem.\n\n\fMODULE INVARIANTS AND BLOCKS OF FINITE GROUP SCHEMES\n\n11\n\nLemma 4.5. ([10], [6]) Let \u03b1 be any flat map from k[t]/(tp ) \u2192 kG. Then the\nimage of the induced map \u03b1\u2022 : H\u2022 (G, k) \u2192 H\u2022 (k[t]/(tp ), k) is not contained in\nH0 (k[t]/(tp ), k).\nWe will now prove that any flat map to a unipotent finite group scheme is\nequivalent to one which factors through an abelian subgroup scheme. Let us first\nthough observe that such a statement is not completely trivial, by showing that\nthere do exist flat maps to unipotent finite group schemes which do not factor\nthrough abelian subgroup schemes.\nExample 4.6. Let G be a non-abelian p-group, and choose g1 \u2208 Z(G) such that\n|g1 | = p. Set\nX\nx = 1 \u2212 g1 , N =\ng\ng\u2208G\n\nThe element x + N is p-nilpotent, and is not contained in any subgroup algebra.\nWe know that the map sending t to x makes kG into a free k[t]/(tp )-module. Since\nxN = 0, there is some element y \u2208 kG such that N = xp\u22121 y. It then follows by\n[10, 2.2] that the map sending t to x + N = x + x(xp\u22122 y) also determines a left-flat\nmap from k[t]/(tp ) to kG, and thus is a flat map which is not a p-point.\nTheorem 4.7. If G is a unipotent finite group scheme, then every flat map k[t]/(tp ) \u2192\nkG is equivalent to a p-point of G.\nProof. Let \u03b1, \u03b2 be any two flat maps such that the maps they induce in cohomology have the same kernel. That is, ker \u03b1\u2022 = ker \u03b2 \u2022 . Since k is the only simple\nkG-module, then for any module M , we can calculate VG (M ) according to the annihilator of Ext\u2217kG (k, M ). Now consider the module k \u21d1G\n\u03b1 := Hom\u03b1(k[t]/(tp )) (kG, k)\n(i.e. the coinduced or induced module, depending on terminology, from the subalgebra of kG that is the image of k[t]/(tp ) under \u03b1). The identification of n-fold\nextensions under the Eckmann-Shapiro isomorphism (see [1, 2.8]), shows that the\naction of H \u2022 (G, k) on Ext\u2217kG (k, k\u21d1G\n\u03b1 ) via the Yoneda product is the same as is given\nby H \u2022 (G, k) acting on Ext\u2217k[t]/(tp ) (k, k) via \u03b1\u2022 followed by Yoneda product. Thus,\nG\nker \u03b1\u2022 = ker \u03b2 \u2022 implies that VG (k \u21d1G\n\u03b1 ) = VG (k \u21d1\u03b2 ). If M is any kG-module, we\nG\n\u2217\nG\n\u2217\nthen have that VG (k \u21d1\u03b1 \u2297M ) = VG (k \u21d1\u03b2 \u2297M ), so that in particular:\n\u2217\nG\n\u2217\n(k \u21d1G\n\u03b1 \u2297M ) proj. \u21d0\u21d2 (k \u21d1\u03b2 \u2297M ) proj.\n\nWe have the chain of isomorphisms:\nn\nn\n\u2217 \u223c\nG \u223c\n\u2217\nExtnkG (k, k \u21d1G\n\u03b1 \u2297M ) = ExtkG (M, k \u21d1\u03b1 ) = Extk[t]/(tp ) (\u03b1 (M ), k)\nSince both kG and k[t]/(tp ) have k as their only simple module, then in both\nmodule categories any non-projective module must have a non-trivial n-fold extension by k for all n. Thus\n\u2217\nG\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u03b1\u2217 (M ) proj. \u21d0\u21d2 (k \u21d1G\n\u03b1 \u2297M ) proj. \u21d0\u21d2 (k \u21d1\u03b2 \u2297M ) proj. \u21d0\u21d2 \u03b2 (M ) proj.\n\nThis proves that flat maps from k[t]/(tp ) to kG inducing the same kernel in\ncohomology are equivalent. Finally, we observe that if \u03b1 is flat, then by Lemma\n4.5 we have that ker \u03b1\u2022 is a non-trivial maximal homogeneous ideal of H\u2022 (G, k). It\nfollows from Theorem 1.1 (and the definition of the map \u03a8, see [10, 2.8]) that there\nis a p-point \u03b2 such that ker \u03b2 \u2022 = ker \u03b1\u2022 , which completes the proof.\n\u0003\n\n\f12\n\nPAUL SOBAJE\n\nRemark 4.8. This shows that in terms of giving a representation-theoretic description of support varieties, the definition of a p-point could simply be that it\nis a left-flat map factoring through a unipotent subgroup scheme. However, the\ncreation of p-points has led to new invariants for modules, and it is unclear if these\ninvariants would work with an altered definition as suggested above.\nHaving established the previous result, we can now prove that for principal blocks\nwhich are local, there is a homeomorphism P (G)B0 \u223c\n= F (B0 ), which, as mentioned\nearlier, provides a nice symmetry with Theorem 3.2.\nProposition 4.9. Let G be a finite group scheme, and suppose that the trivial\nmodule is the only simple module lying in the principal block B0 . Then the map\n\u03c10 \u2217 : P (G)B0 \u2192 F (B0 ) is a homeomorphism.\nProof. Let \u03b1 be a flat-point of B0 . We have a map \u03b1\u2022 : H\u2022 (B0 , k) \u2192 H\u2022 (k[t]/(tp ), k).\nBy Proposition 3.4, B0 is isomorphic as an algebra to the group algebra of a unipotent group scheme. We can thus apply Lemma 4.5 to see that ker \u03b1\u2022 is not the\naugmentation ideal of H\u2022 (B0 , k). We also have that \u03c10 induces an isomorphism\n\u223c\n\u03c1\u20220 : H\u2022 (B0 , k) \u2192 H\u2022 (G, k), thus \u03c1\u20220 (ker \u03b1\u20220 ) is not the augmentation ideal H\u2022 (G, k).\nBy the same reasoning used towards the end of the proof of Theorem 4.7, there is\na p-point \u03b2 of kG such that \u03b2 \u2022 : H\u2022 (G, k) \u2192 H\u2022 (k[t]/(tp ), k) satisfies\nker \u03b1\u2022 = ker (\u03b2 \u2022 \u25e6 \u03c1\u20220 )\nThus, \u03b1 and (\u03c10 \u25e6 \u03b2) are two flat-points of B0 inducing the same kernel in\ncohomology, and since B0 is isomorphic to the group algebra of a unipotent group\nscheme, the equivalence of \u03b1 and \u03c10 \u25e6\u03b2 follows from Theorem 4.7. Hence \u03c10 \u2217 ([\u03b2]G ) =\n\u0003\n[\u03b1]B0 , and as \u03b1 was arbitrary, \u03c10 \u2217 is surjective.\nReferences\n[1] D.J.
