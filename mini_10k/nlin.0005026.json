This Letter reports that a combination of the sensitivity of on-off intermittency and the symmetry-breaking\nof the bursting can result in remarkable features in the\nsystems subjected to a weak modulation signal in the\nnoisy environment.\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nNonlinear dynamical systems possessing an invariant\nsubspace are of great interest, particularly when the\nsystem motion within the subspace can be chaotic or\nstochastic. Examples include chaotic systems with symmetry [1,2] or coupled chaotic systems [3]. Bubbling [4,5]\nand on-off intermittency [6] are typical behaviors in system close to a threshold of transverse stability of the subspace due to the fluctuative nature of the local transverse\nLyapunov exponent in different part of the subspace. In\nbubbling, the subspace is stable on average, but local instability can result in large bursts away from the subspace\nwhen it is perturbed. The sensitivity of this weak stability to parameter mismatch and noise has been studied by\nPikovsky and Grassberger [7]. Intermittent loss of synchronization [5] in experiments with inevitable noise and\nparameter mismatch is undesirable in application of highquality synchronization, such as to communication [8].\nIn on-off intermittency, the subspace is slightly unstable\non average, but local transverse attraction may keep the\ndynamics very close to the subspace for a long period of\ntime. Great attention has been paid to the duration of\nthis laminar period which exhibits universal power law\ndistribution in a broad class of systems [6]. Noise in the\nsystem prevents its state from approaching the subspace\nclose beyond the noise level, thus has important effects on\nthe laminar period distribution [9] or the escape time [10].\nIn noisy environment, bubbling and on-off intermittency\nare essentially the same phenomenon.\nSensitivity in nonlinear systems can be very useful for\napplications such as controlling global dynamics of the\nsystem by local tiny perturbations [11]. It is interesting\nto ask whether the sensitivity of on-off intermittency may\nlead to any potential application of the phenomenon. An\nobservation is that in a class of symmetric systems, on-off\nintermittency can be symmetry-breaking [1], namely, the\nbursting behavior does not possess the system symmetry\n\nII. THE MODEL\n\nLet x(t) represent the distance of the dynamics from\nthe invariant subspace, and x(t) > 0 and x(t) < 0 denote\nthe dynamics in the two symmetric components respectively. In the symmetry-breaking systems, transitions between x > 0 and x < 0 can only occur when x(t) comes to\nthe level of the weak noisy signal. For system displaying\nappreciable laminar state, main features of the dynamics\ncan be described by the general linear equation close to\nthe subspace:\n\u1e8b(t) = [\u03bb + \u03c31 \u03be(t)]x(t) + \u03c32 e(t) + ps(t).\n\n(1)\n\nHere \u03bb is the transverse Lyapunov exponent of the subspace, and \u03c31 \u03be(t) with h\u03be(t)i = 0 is the fluctuation of the\nlocal Lyapunov exponent due to the chaotic or stochastic\nmotion within the subspace. In general, chaotic system\nhas quickly decaying correlation, and in a large enough\ntime scale t, \u03be(t) has an asymptotic Gaussian distribution. e(t) is the additive white noise with level \u03c32 \u226a \u03c31\nand s(t) is a weak modulation signal. The exact form\nof the signal is unimportant for the phenomena reported\nbelow, provided it varies on a time scale slower than the\ncharacteristic times of the systems. Here we consider s(t)\na random binary stream (\u00b11 with probability 0.5) with\na bit duration T . p \u226a \u03c31 is the amplitude of the signal, and R = p/\u03c32 provides a natural measure of the\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR).\nIn Ref. [10], Cenys and Lustfeld studied the statistical properties of escape time of on-off intermittency sub1\n\n\fIn both cases, the weak noisy input has no significant effects on the system behavior, i.e. the system is insensitive\nto the modulation. On the other hand, the diffusion is\ndominant for tb \u226b td , and the system can have access to\nboth the level of the weak input and the boundary of the\nnonlinearity, exhibiting typical on-off intermittency and\nsensitivity to the weak modulation. Variation of the parameter \u03bb or \u03c31 affects the competition between the drift\nand the diffusion, and the system is expected to display\noptimal response to the weak modulation with resonant\ncharacterization.\n\njected to noise by means of Fokker-Planck equation. It\nhas been shown that on-off intermittency is very sensitive to noise [9,10]. We employ the same approach of\nFokker-Planck equation, and focus on the property of\namplification of the weak external signal s(t) in the system. Our results will demonstrate that the system is also\nvery sensitive to the weak signal, and the amplification\nof the weak signal is robust to the additive noise. This\nsensitivity exhibits resonant behavior as the system parameters change.\nThe Fokker-Planck equation for Eq. (1) is\n\u001a\u0014\n\u0015 \u001b\n\u03c312\n\u2202\n\u2202W\n(\u03bb +\n=\u2212\n)x + ps(t) W\n\u2202t\n\u2202x\n2\n1 \u22022\n[(\u03c3 2 x2 + \u03c322 )W ].\n(2)\n+\n2 \u2202x2 1\n\nIII. ROBUSTNESS OF SUPERSENSITIVITY TO\nTHE WEAK SIGNAL\n\nLet us consider the diffusion dominant region close to\nthe critical point of the stability of the subspace, e.g.\n|\u03bb| \u226a 1, |\u03b1 ln(xb /A)| \u226a 1, \u03c31 \u223c 1, p \u223c 10\u2212m (m \u226b 1).\nEmploying the approximation in Eq. (4), and the effective reflecting boundaries at \u00b1xb , the ensemble average\nhx(t)i is estimated as\n\nIn general, it is quite difficult to solve Eq. (2) exactly.\nLet T0 be the relaxation time of the system after s(t)\nswitching from +1 (\u22121) to \u22121 (+1). If T \u226b T0 , the\nprobability distribution W (t) can establish an approximate static state during each bit of the input signal.\nUnder the adiabatic approximation T \u226b T0 , \u2202W/\u2202t \u2248 0,\nand the static solution can be obtained analytically as\n\nhx(t)i \u2248 s(t)\n\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0012\n\u0013(\u03b1\u22121)/2\n\u03c31 x\n2ps(t)\n\u03c322\n2\narctan\nexp\n,\nW (x) = C x + 2\n\u03c31\n\u03c31 \u03c32\n\u03c32\n\nxb\n\u03c0R\n,\ntanh\nln(xb /A)\n\u03c31\n\n(5)\n\nwhich in the noise-free limit \u03c32 \u2192 0, assumes the form\nhx(t)i \u2248 s(t)\n\n(3)\nwhere \u03b1 = 2\u03bb/\u03c312 . For |\u03c31 x/A| \u226b 1 (A = max(p, \u03c32 )),\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u03c0ps(t)\nsgnx .\n(4)\nW (x) \u2248 C|x|\u03b1\u22121 exp\n\u03c31 \u03c32\n\nxb\n.\nln(xb ) \u2212 ln p\n\n(6)\n\nA logarithmical dependence of hx(t)i on the input level p\nmeans an amplification of the weak signal ps(t) with an\nfactor hxi/p \u223c 10m /m (m \u226b 1), i.e. the system exhibits\nsupersensitivity to extremely weak modulation close to\nthe critical point. This sensitivity was also reported in an\noverdamped Kramers oscillator with multiplicative noise\nfree from additive noise (\u03c32 = 0), which is a specific\nexample in this class of systems [12]. In the absence\nof s(t), the system produces symmetric bursting pattern\nwith hx(t)i = 0; while the bursting pattern is reorganized\nto manifest the weak signal after it is fed into the system\n(see Fig. 1). The most interesting and practically important property is that the weak signal is manifested even\nburied in a relatively high level of noise, namely, the robustness of the supersensitivity. This behavior originates\nfrom the symmetry-breaking of the on-off intermittency\nin the system.\nTo demonstrate the above analysis, we employ the following system in simulations [1]\n\nNow we see that the behavior of the system can be\ndivided into two regimes. One is |x| \u226b |\u03c32 e(t) + ps(t)|,\nwhere the dynamics is governed approximately by \u1e8b(t) =\n[\u03bb + \u03c31 \u03be(t)]x(t). Let z = ln |x|, then \u017c(t) = \u03bb + \u03c31 \u03be(t)\nwhich describes a Brownian motion with a constant drift\n\u03bb and diffusion constant \u03c312 /2. The nonlinearity of the\nsystem can be modeled by an effective reflecting boundaries of the Brownian motion at \u00b1xb , which is of the\norder of \u03c31 . The probability density has a power form\nW (x) = |x|\u03b1\u22121 , but is asymmetric for x > 0 and x < 0\nin the presence of s(t). The system can rarely perform\ntransition between x > 0 and x < 0 in this regime due\nto the symmetry-breaking property, until it comes to the\nother regime, where the noisy input \u03c32 e(t) + ps(t) dominates the dynamics and the system performs transition\nbetween x > 0 and x < 0 frequently. The behavior of the\nsystem is determined by the competition between the diffusion and the drift of the Brownian motion. If the drift\ntime tb = ln(\u03c31 /A)/|\u03bb| is much smaller than the diffusion\ntime td = 2 ln2 (\u03c31 /A)/\u03c312 , the drift is dominant over the\ndiffusion, and the system will either come to a metastable\nstate induced by the noisy input for \u03bb < 0, or approach\nsome state away from the invariant subspace for \u03bb > 0.\n\n\u00ff = \u2212\u03b3 \u1e8f + 4y(1 \u2212 y 2 ) + f0 sin \u03c9t,\n\u1e8b = (a + by) sin(x) \u2212 x + \u03c32 e(t) + ps(t),\n\n(7)\n\nwhere y constitutes the forced Duffing chaotic oscillator.\nWith \u03b3 = 0.05, f0 = 2.3 and \u03c9 = 3.5, the Duffing system is chaotic and \u03c31 \u2248 0.964b. The nonlinearity of the\nvariable x is related to an experimental model of superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) [13].\n2\n\n\fC will be small. On the opposite, if \u03bb is rather above\nthe critical point, the drift is also dominant so that the\nsystem can seldom access to the level of the weak modulation, and becomes insensitive to the switching of s(t)\nbetween \u00b11, resulting in a small C again. Close to the\ncritical point, the system can access to the level of the\nweak signal and produce large bursts frequently due to\nstrong enough diffusion. The switching of the weak signal is \"sensed\" and manifested by asymmetrical bursting\nto x > 0 and x < 0, giving an optimal value of C. This\nprecess is illustrated by C as a function of \u03bb in Fig. 2 for\nvarious R values.\n(2)With the change of \u03c31 . For a small \u03c31 where the\ndrift is dominant over diffusion, the system is not sensitive to the weak noisy input and C assumes a small value.\nWith the increase of \u03c31 , the diffusion becomes stronger,\nresulting in a smaller relaxation time T0 and more frequent large bursts, and the system becomes more sensitive to the weak input. In the noise-free case \u03c32 = 0,\nthe increased sensitivity enables X(t) to keep closer in\nphase to the weak signal s(t) and C approaches closer\nto 1.0 if the system maintains to work in the symmetrybreaking regime, and in general a resonant behavior is not\nexpected. The picture becomes quite different if \u03c32 6= 0.\nWith smaller T0 and increased sensitivity, the system can\nkeep up with and manifest more and more noise-induced\ntransitions in shorter time-scales, and the transition rate\nof X(t) between \u00b11 may become much higher than that\nof s(t), leading to a decreasing C. An optimal response is\nachieved when the diffusion is strong enough to become\nsensitive to the weak input but not too strong to manifest a lot of noise-induced transitions in short time-scales.\nTypical example of the system response as a function of\n\u03c31 is shown in Fig. 3.\nThe above resonant behavior is similar to the conventional stochastic resonance where a dynamical system displays increased sensitivity to a subthreshold signal with an optimal level of additive noise, see Ref. [14]\nfor an extensive review. Resonance occurs when a noisecontrolled time-scale in the system matches that of the\nsignal. In our system, the underlying mechanism of the\nresonant behavior is quite different. The sensitivity to\nan extremely weak signal is induced by the multiplicative\nchaotic or stochastic motion in the subspace. To achieve\nthis sensitivity, it is required that the system is in the\non-off intermittency regime so that it can become susceptible to the weak signal by coming close enough to the\nsubspace, and manifest and amplify it by quick enough\nlarge bursts away from the subspace with symmetrybreaking. As system parameters \u03bb and \u03c31 change, a\ncompetition between these two factors leads to the resonant behavior. More interestingly, resonant behavior\nwith respect to the change of \u03c31 , the level of the multiplicative chaos (noise), necessarily occurs only in the\npresence of the additive noise due to the nature of this\ncompetition. These features are generic and universal in\na general class of systems displaying on-off intermittency\nwith symmetry breaking. Multiplicative stochastic res-\n\nHowever, we should stress that the specific form of the\nnonlinearity is of no importance for the phenomena. The\ntransverse Lyapunov exponent of the invariant subspace\nx = 0 is \u03bb = a \u2212 1 due to the symmetry of the Duffing chaotic attractor. Fig. 1 shows typical behavior of\nthe system and good agreement between the analytical\nand the simulation results for hx(t)i as a function of R.\nThe agreement demonstrates that the general stochastic model in Eq. (1) gives good account for this type of\nsystem even though the motion in the subspace is deterministic chaos.\n\nIV. RESONANT BEHAVIOR\n\nIt is difficult to perform generally a quantitative analysis of the system response to the weak signal based on\nthe linear dynamics in Eq. (1) as parameters \u03bb or \u03c31\nchanges, because the effective boundary xb changes with\nthe nonlinearity and the linear dynamical model with\nan effective reflecting boundary is often not sufficient to\ncapture the dynamical property if \u03b1 is appreciately positive. Moreover, as the parameters change, the relaxation\ntime T0 may become comparable to the bit duration T ,\nand the transient behavior plays an important role in the\nsystem response and an adiabatic approximation is not\nvalid any more. To demonstrate the resonant properties,\nwe rely on simulations with the system in Eq. (7), while\nthe Brownian motion model can provide a qualitative\nunderstanding of the properties, thus showing that the\nproperties are generic and universal for a general class of\nthe systems.\nFor a system with on-off intermittent output x(t), the\nensemble average hx(t)i and the correlation between s(t)\nand x(t) is relatively small even for the noise-free case\n\u03c32 = 0, due to the power law fluctuation of x(t). To better characterize the response of the system to the modulation, we transfer the output series x(t) into a binary\nstream X(t) by a threshold crossing process: suppose x(t)\nbecomes larger than a prescribed threshold xth at some\nmoment, after that X(t) will keep at X(t) = 1 until x(t)\ncrosses \u2212xth at another moment; X(t) will not switch\nback from X(t) = \u22121 to +1 until x(t) crosses xth again,\nand so on. This binary presentation captures the most\nimportant feature of the transition of the bursting pattern between the two symmetric attractors. X(t) has a\nstrong correlation with s(t) for weak noise case \u03c32 < p if\nthe system is close to the critical point. The exact value\nof xth is not crucial for the properties described below.\nIn the following, we fix p = 10\u22127 , T = 2000 and xth = 1,\nand take the cross-correlation function C between s(t)\nand X(t) estimated using 104 bits of a random stream of\ns(t) to demonstrate the resonant behavior in the system.\n(1) With the change of \u03bb. For \u03bb rather below the critical point \u03bb = 0, the system has a metastable state close\nto the level of the noisy input, and the diffusion is not\nstrong enough to produce large bursts frequently enough,\n3\n\n\fonance has been studied by Gammaitoni et al [15] in a\nmultiplicatively driven bistable system with \u03bb = 1. In\nthat case, the system is out of the regime of on-off intermittency, and consequently cannot display the property\nof (super)sensitivity, and the resonance with respect to\nthe change of \u03bb was not resported.\n\n[1] Ying-Cheng Lai, Phys.

INFORMATION GAIN\n\nNow consider the system from the viewpoint of transmission and amplification of a weak signal ps(t) contaminated with channel noise \u03c32 e(t) through a system displaying on-off intermittency with symmetry-breaking. It\nis very interesting and practically important that more\ninformation about the signal may be obtained from the\noutput X(t) than from the noisy input ps(t) + \u03c32 e(t) itself, besides the fact that the weak signal has been amplifyed to a level discernible with a low resolution detector.\nTo examine the information gain, we compare C with the\ncorrelation between the signal ps(t) and\n\u221a the total noisy\ninput ps(t) + \u03c32 e(t), i.e. Cin = R/ 1 + R2 . C, Cin\nand their difference are shown in Fig. 4. C comes to a\nsaturated value for R \u2265 1, where the noise-induced transitions between x > 0 and x < 0 in short time-scales\nare rarely manifested by large bursts. This value does\nnot approach 1.0 as Cin due to an average time-delay\nbetween X(t) and s(t) induced by the relaxation time\nwhich is longer for weaker signal. Clearly, appreciable\ninformation gain is obtained by the system in a broad\nrange of R, and an optimal gain is found at a certain R\nvalue. If taking into account the effect of the time-delay\nbetween X(t) and s(t), e.g. by defining C\u03c4 as the maximum of the correlation between X(t) and s(t \u2212 \u03c4 ), the\ninformation gain region can be wider (Fig. 4).\nTo conclude, we demonstrate interesting universal features of robustness of supersensitivity, resonance and information gain in a class of nonlinear system subjected to\na weak modulation. These systems present a new mechanism of resonant behavior compared to conventional\nstochastic resonance. While intermittent loss of synchronization may be harmful for any applications employing high-quality synchronization [5], the features found\nin this letter are meaningful for potential applications\nof on-off intermittency. On-off intermittency has been\ndemonstrated in many experimental systems and we believe that the behaviors reported in this work can be\ntested in physical experiments.\nThis work is supported in part by grants from the Hong\nKong Research Grants Council (RGC) and the Hong\nKong Baptist University Faculty Research Grant (FRG).\n\nFIG. 1.
