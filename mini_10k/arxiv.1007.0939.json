Introduction\nDistances to Galactic planetary nebulae (PNe) present a severe\nand longstanding problem. Obtaining an accurate distance scale\nfor PNe will allow us to compute the total number of PNe in\nthe Galaxy, which has important implications for the Galactic\nultraviolet radiation field, the total processed mass returned to\nthe interstellar medium, and more generally to our understanding\nof the chemical evolution of the Galaxy.\nA method that is a priori independent of assumptions about\nthe physical or geometrical properties of the nebulae is the extinction method. Assuming that the interstellar extinction to a\ncertain nebula can be determined, if one is able to build up the\nextinction-distance relation using field stars around the line of\nsight to the nebula, the relation can be used to infer the distance\nto the PN.\nThe application of this method is not new. Lutz (1973) measured the distance to 6 PNe using some 10 field stars per object.\nLater, the method was applied by Acker (1978) who provided\nreliable distance values for 11 PNe and a rough estimation for\n\n34 other ones, and more recently by Gathier et al. (1986) who\nmeasured the distance to 12 PNe using some 50 stars per PN.\nIn the last paper, a comprehensive discussion about different aspects of this method can be found. The number of stars for determining distances was increased by Pollacco & Ramsay (1992)\nwho, using a colour analysis of the field stars, were able to reach\nan accurate spectral classification for stars later than F5 type.\nAs late-type stars constitute the most numerous objects in all\ngalactic-plane directions, they allow an extensive application of\nthis method to determine distances to PNe in the Galaxy.\nThe availability of the IPHAS H\u03b1 survey of the Northern\nGalactic Plane (Drew et al. 2005) and its coming extension to\nthe South (VPHAS+) opens new doors for the application of\nthe method. IPHAS allows us to determine extinction-distance\ncurves using a large number of field stars, typically several hundred in areas as small as 10\u2032 \u00d7 10\u2032 around each line of sight. The\ntechnique is presented and discussed by Sale et al. (2009). In this\npaper, we will present its application to Galactic PNe. We determine the distance to 70 PNe included in the ESO/Strasbourg catalogue (Acker et al. 1992), and compare the distances obtained\n\n\f2\n\nDistances of Planetary Nebulae: IPHAS extinction distances to Planetary Nebulae\n\nwith those obtained by other authors using different methods.\nThis shows how IPHAS and its successor surveys potentially\nprovide a new and powerful tool to obtain distances to a large\nnumber of Galactic PNe.\n\n2. The data\nIPHAS is a wide-field, CCD, H\u03b1 survey of the Northern Galactic\nPlane (Drew et al., 2005), carried out at the 2.5m Isaac Newton\nTelescope on La Palma, Spain. Imaging is performed also in the\nr\u2032 and i\u2032 bands down to r\u2032 \u223c 20 (10\u03c3). The high quality photometry and characteristics of the survey permit the spectral classification of main-sequence stars to be determined, based on the\nH\u03b1 line strength. The availability of reliably calibrated (r\u2032 - H\u03b1 )\ncolours permit the spectral classification of most stars, while the\n(r\u2032 - i\u2032 ) colour provides their extinctions, allowing distances to be\nestimated from the r\u2032 measurements. The limiting magnitude in\nr\u2032 permits extinctions to be measured to distances of up \u223c 10\nkpc.\nIPHAS covers the Galactic latitude range between -5 and\n5 deg, and longitude range between 29.52 and 215.49. In this\nregion of the sky there are 190 known PNe according to the\nESO/Strasbourg catalogue (Acker et al., 1992). We were able\nto extract a reddening for 137 of them from different sources;\nfor 27 PNe we present the first determinations.\n2.1. PN extinctions extracted from the literature\n\nThe ESO/Strasbourg catalog provides the H\u03b1 /H\u03b2 line ratio for\nmost of the PNe considered here. These data were measured\nfrom spectra obtained using two different telescopes: the 1.52m\nESO telescope for the Southern nebulae, and the 1.93m OHP\ntelescope for the Northern ones. Further details about the instruments (photographic plate or CCD) and spectra can be found\nin Acker et al. (1992, SECGPN), Acker & Stenholm (1987),\nand Stenholm & Acker (1987). Later, Tylenda et al. (1992) used\nthese SECGPN line intensities to obtain the value of the extinction constant roughly determined for about 900 PNe. In this paper the visual extinction was obtained from the line ratios by\napplying the formulae:\n!\n(H\u03b1 /H\u03b2 )\n(1)\nc\u03b2 = 2.84 * log\n2.86\nAv = 2.15 * c\u03b2\n\n(2)\n\nwhich come from Fitzpatrick (2004). Here we assumed R=3.1,\nin order to be consistent with the method by which the IPHAS\nextinction curves are built (see section 3).\nOther compilations from which c\u03b2 was retrieved are Cahn\net al. (1992) and in few cases Stasi\u0144ska et al. (1992). The latter\npaper compared the optical and radio extinction determinations,\nusing the same \"SECGPN\" line fluxes as Tylenda et al. (1992),\nand adding some other measurements, for a total of 130 PNe.\nFor individual nebulae, these listings where supplemented with\ndata from other papers, where available. In all cases, when in a\npaper the assumed reddening law is reported, we normalize the\npublished extinction using Eqs. (1) and (2). Specifically, this is\nthe case for data in Cahn et al. (1992) and Stasi\u0144ska et al. (1992).\nFor most of the nebulae the only available extinction coefficient\ncomes from the Strasbourg catalog, while for a subset there are\nmultiple determinations. For a small number of nebulae there is a\nvery extensive literature; and in those cases we selected what we\nbelieve is the most accurate determination of c\u03b2 after a careful\n\nFig. 1. c\u03b2 measurements by by Cahn et al. (1992) plotted against\ndata in Acker et al. (1992). The dispersion is around 0.4 in c\u03b2 .\n\nanalysis of bibliographic sources. In addition, for some nebulae\nwe also present new optical c\u03b2 determinations.\nA general rule in case of multiple determinations and in\nthe absence of other information (the quality of one measurement with respect to another) is to choose the smallest c\u03b2 . The\nmain reason is that slit spectra taken at non-negligible zenith distances are often affected by differential atmospheric dispersion\nwhich removes blue light leading to an overestimate of the c\u03b2 's.\nExtinction measurements obtained via radio data are free from\nthis effect, but these give extinctions systematically lower than\nthose determined from the Balmer decrement (Stasi\u0144ska et al.,\n1992, Ruffle et al. 2004). In order to deal with a homogeneous\nset of measurements, we will only consider in this paper c\u03b2 obtained via optical measurements.\nFinally, in order to illustrate the differences between extinction determinations by different authors, we show in Fig. 1 the\nc\u03b2 values obtained by Cahn et al. (1992) versus those computed from fluxes in the ESO/Strasbourg catalog. The associated scatter is \u03c3 = 0.41, which shows how critical the choice\nof the extinction values can be. We note that data from the\nESO/Strasbourg catalog are not all of the same quality, those\nfor the Northern nebulae (56 < l < 184) observed at the OHP\nbeing generally of lower quality than those of (mainly Southern)\nnebulae observed at ESO.\n2.2. New extinction determinations\n\n26 PNe considered in this paper (see Tabs. 1 and 3) were observed at the 2.5m Isaac Newton Telescope at the Observatorio\ndel Roque de los Muchachos, from August 23 to 30, 1997.\nThe IDS spectrograph was used, together with its R300V grating, which gives a reciprocal dispersion of 3.31 \u00c5 per pixel of\nthe 1kx1k Tek3 detector, and a spectral coverage from 3700 to\n6900 \u00c5. The slit width was 1.5 arcsec projected on the sky, providing a spectral resolution of 6.7 \u00c5. Total exposure times on\neach nebula varied from a few seconds for the brightest target\n(NGC 7027) up to one hour for the faintest ones; exposures\nwere split in order to have both the bright and faint nebular\nlines well exposed without saturation. Several spectrophotometric standards were observed during each night for relative flux\ncalibration. Data reduction was performed using the package\nonedspec in IRAF.\n\n\fDistances of Planetary Nebulae: IPHAS extinction distances to Planetary Nebulae\n\n3\n\nAn additional two PNe (PC 20 and Sa 3-151) were observed\nwith the Dual Beam Spectrograph (DBS, Rodgers et a.1988) on\nMay 10 and 14 2008 by B. Miszalski at the Australian National\nUniversity 2.3-m telescope. The exposure times were 300 s and\n150 s, respectively to achieve a SNR of about 20 in the peak intensity of H\u03b2 . The 1200B and 1200R gratings were used with\na slit width of 2\u2032\u2032 (positioned at PA = 270 deg) to give wavelength coverage windows of 4030-5050 \u00c5 and 6245-7250 \u00c5 at\na resolution of \u223c1.6 \u00c5 (FWHM). Data reduction was performed\nusing IRAF and a number of flux standards were observed each\nnight to derive the spectrophotometric response across the separate blue and red spectrograph arms.\n\n3. IPHAS extinction-reddening curves for the PNe\nExtinction-distance relationships for the lines of sight toward\nthe sample of 136 Galactic PNe in the IPHAS area have been\ncomputed with the algorithm MEAD, as described by Sale et al.\n(2009). MEAD exploits a feature of the IPHAS colour-colour\nplane, whereby it is possible to simultaneously accurately determine the spectral type of a star and its reddening, avoiding the\nserious degeneracies that exist in other filter systems and with\nonly a slight dependence on a Galactic model.\nTypically, several thousand A to K4 stars in a box of sides\n10\u2032 , centred on the PNe, have been employed in the computation\nof each relationship. Distances to each star are obtained from\ntheir apparent magnitude, the MEAD extinction , and the absolute magnitude of the star derived from the MEAD spectral type.\nThe photometric errors are propagated to give an error on the\nestimated distance to each star. The stars were then binned by\ndistance, with each bin being at least 100 pc deep, containing at\nleast 8 stars and having a total signal to noise ratio in the bin of\nat least 130. In a small departure from the method described in\nSale et al. (2009), the prior probabilities of each luminosity class\nare determined on a sightline by sightline basis. MEAD returns\nmonochromatic extinctions, these have then been converted to\nAv using the R=3.1 reddening law of Fitzpatrick (1999).\n\n4. The inversion of Distance-Extinction curves\nThe extinction-distance curves obtained are in general linear for\na significant range of distances, until they generally flatten out\nand reach an asymptotic value once the line of sight leaves the\ndust layer within the Galactic Plane (Fig. 2). Even in the cases\nwhere they show a more complex shape, it is generally possible to select a linear region around the point in which we are\ninterested, e.g. the Av measured for the nebula.\nWe assume that the measured Av,i are distributed around a\ntrue value Atv,i = a + bdi following a Gaussian law whose dispersion is \u03c3A . If so, a least square fit to the selected part of the curve\nallows us to determine all the needed parameters. Specifically,\naround a point, for each d, the probability-distribution to measure a given Av is P(Av |d). The next step is to invert the probability distribution, i.e. to obtain the probability to find a distance\nd for a given Av,i : P(d|Av,i ).\nWe note that:\nP(d|Av,i ) = R\n\nP(Av,i |d)\nP(Av |d)dAv\n\n(3)\n\nand using the previous assumptions of linearity and Gaussian\ndistribution for P(Av |d), the new distribution for P(d|Av ) is itself\n\nFig. 2. Extinction law within 10\u2032 \u00d7 10\u2032 around the line of sight\ntoward the NGC 6894. The measured extinction of the nebula is\nalso indicated by the horizontal line, and the two vertical lines\nlimit the interval in which the law is linear and which we have\nused to find the corresponding distance to the PN.\nGaussian. We call the central value of this distribution dA and \u03c3d\nthe dispersion. It follows that\ndA = (Av,i \u2212 a)/b,\n\n(4)\n\nand\n\u03c3d = \u03c3A /b.\n\n(5)\n\nIn Fig. 2, we show as an example the well defined extinction\ncurve along the line of sight towards NGC 6894. For this nebula,\nthe measured extinction value is c\u03b2 = 0.67, or Av = 1.44 (data\nfrom Ciardullo et al., 1999). The limits for the selected linear\nrange are 800 and 2300 pc (sensitivity range of the method).\nThe estimated distance is d = 1000 pc and the formal standard\ndeviation is \u03c3d = 150 pc. We stress that the formal \u03c3 is only part\nof the total uncertainty, whose major contribution is due to the\nerror in c\u03b2 measurement; other uncertainties we will consider in\nthe following section.\nIn order to simplify the discussion in the next section about\nthe uncertainty introduced by the inaccuracies in Av , we will fix\nrepresentative values the parameters b and \u03c3d . This is done by\nanalysing almost two hundred lines of sight. We found a representative mean value for the parameter b of 6.53*10\u22124 mag/pc\n(Fig.3), and a typical error in the fitting process of around 10%.\nA test distance of 2500 pc is also assumed. This is in the middle\nof the range over which the extinction-distance method is sensitive for the low Galactic latitude coverage that characterizes the\nIPHAS survey. This range was calculated by taking the mean of\nthe lower and upper limits of the linear interval corresponding\nto each curve. For the adopted distance, the typical error for the\nfitting process is around 250 pc. If so, we can express the relative\nuncertainty for the distance as:\nE=\n\np\n\nEAv =\n\n2502 + (\u03c3Av /6.53 10\u22124 )2\n2500\n\n(6)\n\n\u03c3Av /6.53 10\u22124\n2500\n\n(7)\n\n\f4\n\nDistances of Planetary Nebulae: IPHAS extinction distances to Planetary Nebulae\n\nx\n\nFig. 3. Distribution of the values of the slope b mag/pc obtained\nfrom a linear fit of the interstellar extinction curves. We analyzed\nmore than 100 lines of sight corresponding to the know PNe\nin the IPHAS survey. Almost 80% of the values are distributed\nbetween 1.3*10\u22124 and 8*10\u22124\nwhere E is the total uncertainty and EAv is the contribution of\nAv . From the previous formulae for \u03c3Av =0.16 (\u03c3c\u03b2 =0.077) we\nobtain EAv \u223c10% and E \u223c14%. Finally we note that the previous formulae are exact in the case of purely statistical errors,\notherwise they represent a lower limit to the true uncertainty.\n\n5. On the errors\nIn section 2 we saw how large the difference can be between the\nc\u03b2 values determined for the same nebula by different authors.\nThe origin of these differences could be systematic errors due\nto the instruments or in the reduction processes. Unfortunately\nit is impossible to quantify a priori this effect. However, in\nthe determination of the interstellar reddening and hence of the\nextinction-distance there are other sources of uncertainty that we\ndiscuss below.\n\nlaw is used. We conservatively adopt this difference when the\nextinction law is not quoted in a paper from which the c\u03b2 for a\nspecific PN is adopted. This results in a difference of 15% in c\u03b2 ,\nor \u03c3Av = 0.3 (for Av =2), and a contribution to the error on the\ndistance of about 20%.\nAnother common hypothesis is that the characteristics of the\ninterstellar dust are constant for all lines of sight, and correspond to R = 3.1, the mean value of the Milk Way. Fitzpatrick\n(1999) and Fitzpatrick & Massa (2007) state that for optical\nwavelengths a single value of R is a good approximation, but\nR can vary for different lines of sight. Several authors report\nR \u223c 2 through the galactic bulge (Byun 1996, Udalski 2003,\nRuffle et al. 2005) and towards the halo (Larson and Whittet,\n2005). Stasinska et al. (1992), based on the study of a sample of\nPNe, suggest that for the Galactic Plane a more appropriate value\nis R = 2.5. The parameter R could be instead significantly larger\nif the line of sight crosses a dense dust cloud (due to the generally larger size of the grains). However, it would be unlikely\nto be able to detect the blue part of the spectrum of PNe (and\nthus their H\u03b2 flux) along such highly extinguished directions. In\ngeneral, the R value for a particular nebula can in principle be determined if the number of Balmer lines measured with precision\nis large enough.\nTherefore, we cannot exclude variations of R for our IPHAS\nsample. Having adopted R = 3.1 as a common value, we estimate the error that we make if the true extinction ratio were\n2.1 or 5.5 (maximum and minimum values from Fitzpatrick,\n1999 and Fitzpatrick & Massa 2007). For the case R = 2.1, the\nFitzpatrick law gives Av = 4.8 * log(H\u03b1 /H\u03b2 /2.86) while we use\nAv = 6.1*log(H\u03b1 /H\u03b2 /2.86). This results in an overestimate of Av\nby some 21% , or \u03b4Av = 0.4 (for Av =2). However, in this case the\ncorresponding distance extinction curve is also overestimated by\nabout 15% (section 3). This means that when determining distances these errors partially compensate and the corresponding\noverestimate of Av is of about 6% , or about 12% for a distance\nof 2500 pc. For R = 5.5, we underestimate Av by some 33% ,\nbut the corresponding extinction curve is also underestimated by\n25% , so that a final compensated error is 8% in Av , or \u223c14% for\nthe distance.\n5.2. Error coming from the object's properties\n\n5.1. Sources of error relevant for all objects\n\nIn order to determine the visual extinction to a PN, it is common\nto use the H\u03b1 /H\u03b2 ratio. However, often the literature data quote\nonly the extinction coefficient c\u03b2 . In some cases, the adopted\nextinction law is also quoted, in such a way that we can convert the c\u03b2 's to a common scale, that we adopt to be the law\ngiven in Fitzpatrick (2004), for R=3.1, for a theoretical ratio\nH\u03b1 /H\u03b2 =2.86.\nThe first uncertainty that we consider is that associated with\nthe theoretical H\u03b1 /H\u03b2 ratio as a function of the electron temperature, for case B. Using Osterbrock (2005) for this ratio we find\nthat if the electron temperature varies between 8000 and 20000\nK, the largest error that we would make by adopting a ratio of\n2.86 is 0.04 dex in c\u03b2 , or 0.09 mag in visual extinction. This implies an uncertainty of up to 11% in the distance determination.\nThe second error source that we consider is the adopted extinction law. Several authors use extinction laws different from\nthat adopted in this paper. For example, Stasi\u0144ska et al. (1992)\nused the Seaton (1979) law assuming R=3.2, Cahn et al. (1992)\nused the Whitford (1958) law (R=3.2), while the Howarth (1983,\nR=3.1) law was used by other authors. The maximum difference\nbetween our adopted law occurs when the Cardelli et al. (1989)\n\nAn additional uncertainty resides in the hypothesis that the interstellar medium is responsible for all the reddening measured for\na PN from the Balmer decrement, in other words, that the PNe\nare free of internal or circumnebular absorbing dust (for a review\nsee Barlow, 1983). This hypothesis is in general supported by the\nstudy of K\u00f6ppen (1977) which, assuming that in a planetary nebula the dust and gas components are well mixed, finds that the\nnebular dust optical depth is very small (\u03c4 < 0.05), for a dust/gas\nratio around 10\u22123 . However this could be too simple a picture,\nand in this original work there were also some PNe (6 out of a\ntotal of 21) with evidence for associated extinction. The effect is\nprobably negligible for standard, elliptical PNe (Barlow, 1983),\nbut could be more significant for particular nebular morphologies, such as that of bipolar PNe from massive progenitors (e.g.\nCorradi & Schwarz 1995) which can have massive neutral equatorial envelopes. There is some evidence in the literature that this\nmight be the case.\nThe most studied example of the latter type is NGC 7027.\nOsterbrock (1974) estimated a maximum internal absoption of\n0.6 mag. Woodward et al. (1992) suggested that the obscuring\ndust lies in a shell or disc external to the ionized gas, and recently Bieging et al. (2008) found variations of c\u03b2 from 0.8 to\n\n\fDistances of Planetary Nebulae: IPHAS extinction distances to Planetary Nebulae\n\n2.4. A variation of Av has been measured also for NGC 650-1\nbetween the SW and NE limits of the central emission bar by\nRamos\u2013Larios et al. (2008). Other type-I bipolar nebulae, such\nas Sh 2-71, K 3-94, K 4-55 and M 1-75, show some evidence for\n(generaly modest) extinction variations through their structures\n(Bohigas 1994, 2001). Extreme variations are reached for NGC\n6302 and NGC 6537 (Matsuura et al. 2005a, 2005b).\nThere are also a few indications of associated extinction for\nnon-bipolar morphologies1. In this context an interesting object\nis NGC 6741, for which Sabbadin et al. (2005) find a circumnebular neutral halo generated during a recombination phase following the fading of the central star. This halo was estimated to be\nresponsible for 10-20% of the measured total c\u03b2 . The Helix nebula (NGC 7293) seems to be a very complex object where dust,\nionized and molecular gas cohabit (Speck et al. 2002). Dense\nknots in a PN could also evolve in absorbing filaments, as reported by O'Dell et al. (2003) for the bipolar PN IC 4406.\nFor NGC 6781, Mavromatakis et al. (2001) provide a 2D\nBalmer decrement map, finding variations of H\u03b1 /H\u03b2 ranging\nfrom 5.6 to 7. Though smaller, similar structures are also visible in a similar map obtained for Menzel 1 by Monteiro et al.\n(2005).\nSummarizing, in some cases care has to be taken when\ndetermining the interstellar extinction, especially for particular\ngeometries (bipolar). However, due to the small number of\nstudies it is difficult to estimate the percentage of objects\nbelonging to these categories whose interstellar extinction could\nbe wrongly estimated. In any case the number of bipolar PNe\nis 15% of the total number of planetary nebulae (Corradi &\nSchwarz, 1995), and from this sub-sample significant unrecognized errors are probable only for distant, spatially unresolved\nobjects. We can conclude that only a small fraction of our\ntotal sample will be affected by this kind of uncertainty in the\nestimate.\nConcluding, at present the major contribution to the uncertainty on the distances is due to the Av 's error measurements. For\ntwo nebulae, NGC 6842 and NGC 7048, our own measurements\nallows us to estimate these errors. Combining it to the statistical\nfitting error leads to a final uncertainty on the distance of about\n35%.\n\n6. Distance determinations for the NGC sample\nIn order to minimize the uncertainties we will infer the distances\nfor a sample of very well known PNe in the IPHAS area, shown\nin Table 1.\nThe first PN is NGC 6741 (PNG 033.8-02.6, Fig. 4) which,\nas discussed in the previous section, was found to have nonnegligible internal extinction by Sabbadin et al. (2005). We use\nthe interstellar value given in the same paper to determine its\ndistance. The reported error on the distance comes from the statistical \u03c3d . This also applies to the other PNe in this section,\nexcept for NGC 6842 and NGC 7048 as discussed later.\nFor NGC 6781 (PNG 041.8-02.9, Fig. 4), adopting all the\nreported values of Av , from the minimum value inferred by\nMavromatakis et al. (2001) to the maximum value obtained in\nthis paper, we get a distance smaller than 1000 pc. We can not\nbe more precise since the curve is not determined within this\nrange. However, the result is in line with that of Schwarz and\n1\nNote the possible morphological misclassification of a fraction of\nPNe due to orientation effects: see Manchado (2004)\n\n5\n\nMonteiro (2006), who found a distance of 750 pc using 3D photoionization modeling.\nFor NGC 6804 (PNG 045.7-04.5, Fig. 4), we use the determination of Av obtained by Ciardullo et al. (1999), using Hubble\nimages. The graph has been transfered to the Fitzpatrick law\n(R = 3.1), which is our adopted law for the interstellar extinction. In this case, the inferred distance is < 800 pc, while from\nour measurement of c\u03b2 and the corresponding error we estimate\n850 \u00b1 70 pc. This is a factor of 2 smaller than the statistical\ndistances reported by Cahn et al. (1992) and van de Steene &\nZijlstra (1994). The error on the statistical scales is typically\n30% (1\u03c3), so that these values do not exlude the much shorter\n(and with a smaller uncertainty) distance found here. In favour\nof the smaller distance, we also note that the risk of the extinction method is a tendency to over-estimate distances. Moreover,\nthis is a bipolar nebula for which it may will be possible that the\nmeasured extinction is significantly bigger than the interstellar\ncomponent due to absorbing structure associated with the PN.\nIn our method, the only circumstance in which we can underestimate the distance is if the parameter R > 3.1. This can occur\nwhen the line of sight intersects a dense molecular cloud (a rare\nevent). The map of dense molecular clouds in the Galaxy given\nby Hartmann & Thaddeus (2001) does not show any clouds at\nthese coordinates. So we recommend the use of our estimated\nrange < 800 pc, which is also near the estimate of 870 pc by\nFrew (private communication, Frew et al. 2010 in preparation),\nbased on a relationship between size and surface brightness for\nPNe.\nFor NGC 6803 (PNG 046.4-04.1, Fig. 4), using the extinction value determined by Peimbert & Torres-Peimbert (1987)\n(c\u03b2 =0.53, Av = 1.14), we infer a distance of 950 pc, again less\nthan half the previously reported estimates. Even using the much\nhigher values of c\u03b2 presented by Cahn et al. (1992) we obtain a\nsmaller distances (2100\u00b1300 pc) than those previously reported.\nFor the nearby nebula NGC 6853 (PNG 060.8-03.6, Fig. 4),\nthere exists a parallax measurement (Benedict et al., 2003) yielding a distance of 417+49\n\u221265 pc and a visual extinction coefficient\ntabulated in column labelled \"Others\" of Tab. 1. In this case the\nnebula is outside of the sensitivity range of our method and we\ncan give only an upper limit to the distance.\nFor NGC 6842 (PNG 065.9+00.5, Fig. 4), there is little\ninformation in the literature. From our own measurement obtained at the 2.5m Isaac Newton Telescope on La Palma, we\ndetermine an extinction measurement that is clearly higher than\nthat inferred by adopting line fluxes from the Strasbourg catalog.\nObservations imply a distance of 2700\u00b1950 pc. The error on the\ndistance has been calculated taking into account the fitting \u03c3d =\n749 pc, the error on the extinction measurement 0.15, and the\nslope of the curve, b = 2.6 * 10\u22124 pc/mag.\nNGC 6881 (PNG 074.5+02.1, Fig. 5) is a quadrupolar\nyoung nebula (Guerrero & Manchado, 1998) suggested by\nSabbadin et al. (2005) to have been produced by a massive progenitor and presently in a similar recombination phase to NGC\n6741. If so, it is possible that c\u03b2 overestimates the interstellar extinction and thus the distance using the extinction method, which\nwould then be greater than 4000 pc using the very high absorption reported in column \"Others\" (Kaler & Kwitter, 1987), as\nwell as the value obtained from the Strasbourg catalog. For this\nreason we do not quote a distance in Tab. 1.\nNGC 6894 (PNG 069.4-02.6, Fig. 5) and NGC 7048 (PNG\n088.7-01.6, Fig. 5) are morphologically simpler. The Av of NGC\n6894 is taken from Ciardullo et al. (1999). The extinction coefficient determinations for NGC 7048 are more contradictory. By\nadopting the lowest one, we found that this is a nearby nebula\n\n\f6\n\nDistances of Planetary Nebulae: IPHAS extinction distances to Planetary Nebulae\n\nTable 1.

However, any distance closer than 1000 pc makes\nthe central star absolute magnitude so faint that using a standard\nevolutionary track gives an age of >> 105 yrs for the PN, so\nit is likely more distant. Assuming instead the c\u03b2 obtained by\nour measurement, which agrees with the value in Sabbadin et al.\n(1987) (Av = 1.27), we found a distance between 1000 and 2000\npc.\nNGC 7027 (PNG 084.9-03.4, Fig. 5) is the clearest case presenting evidence of strong internal absorption, as discussed in\nsection 5. Given the difficulty in estimating its exact amount as\na function of the position at which c\u03b2 is measured, no extinction\ndistance is given in Tab. 1 for this nebula.\nNGC 7026 (PNG 089.0+00.3, Fig. 5) is a bipolar nebula\nwith a low extinction coefficient. Using any of the extinction values in Tab. 1, we found a distance < 1500 pc.\nFinally, Benetti et al. (2003) propose NGC 7354 (PNG\n107.8+02.3, Fig. 5) as a probable recombining nebula in its\nfirst phase, as derived from a detailed study of NGC 6818.\nUsing the Feibelman (2000) extinction data and extrapolating\nthe extinction-distance curve to low distances, we found a possible distance of about 1000 pc.\n\n7. Determination of distances for whole sample\nIn this section distances are presented for 64 other planetary nebulae in the area of sky covered by IPHAS. For a further 29 objects only a lower limit to the distance can be obtained. For 17\nPNe we found an upper limit, as given in Table 3. We adopt a\ndistance upper limit when the measured extinction to the nebula is smaller than the first point on the corresponding distanceextinction curve. A distance lower limit is defined when the visual extinction to the nebula lies on the plateau of the interstellar\nextinction curve. For multiple determinations of c\u03b2 the source of\nthe adopted value is reported in bold-face. For upper and lower\nlimits, if no indication is given it means that the same conclusion\nholds for all tabulated c\u03b2 's. The errors on the distances given in\nTable 3 are the fitting errors \u03c3d .\nFor the 14 PNe listed in Tab. 2, we could not estimate the distances because the measured extinction was too far above the interstellar extinction plateau.

(1992).\nSo we consider all PNe with a visual extinction more than\n0.88 magnitude higher than the plateau value to live \"above\" the\nplateau. Considering these nebulae above the plateau is a zero\norder hypothesis, because the measured extinctions are not a homogeneous set of measurements and using a common sigma is\nnot rigorous. However, the PNe listed in Table 2 form a sample\nfor future detailed studies, to understand whether the discrepancy with the reddening-distance curve is due to measurement\nerrors, or if the nebulae have peculiar physical conditions that\naffect the determination of c\u03b2 (e.g. very high densities which\nintroduce optical thickness effects), whether they are misclassified objects (symbiotic stars, nebulae around young stars,etc.),\nor whether there is indeed a non negligible amount of reddening\nassociated with the PNe themselves and not of interstellar origin.\nThe inferred distances are compared in Fig. 6 with those\nof Cahn et al. (1992), based on a modified Shklovsky-Daub\nmethod, of van de Steene & Zijlstra (1994), based on a correlation between radio continuum brightness temperature and radius,\nand of Maciel (1984), based on a mass\u2013radius relationship established from selected electron densities and distances. It is interesting to note that the first two methods seem to provide larger\ndistances than our extinction method, while the latter seems to\nprovide shorter distances. The spread in these graphs is 4.0 kpc\n(Cahn et al. 1992, 39 objects), 6.6 kpc (van de Steene & Zijlstra\n1994, 23 objects), and 2.5 kpc (Maciel, 1984). It therefore seems\nthat the distances found by Maciel better agree with ours than\nthose from the other authors. However, the small number of objects considered (16 PNe, nine of which are at an estimated distance lower than 2 kpc), prevents any conclusion to be drawn\nwith the present sample.\nComparison with other distance scales would be very valuable to better understand the problem. A detailed comparison\nwith distance determined via the relation between size and H\u03b1\nsurface brightness (Frew et al., 2006; Frew, 2008) will be presented in a future paper, when the global photometric calibration\nof the IPHAS survey becomes available.\n\n\fDistances of Planetary Nebulae: IPHAS extinction distances to Planetary Nebulae\n\n7\n\nFig. 4. In the figure we present the extinction distance curves for the first 6 nebulae reported in Table 1. The abscissae are in pc, the\nordinates, in visual magnitudes and the horizontal lines represent the visual extinction corresponding to each nebula, as discussed\nin the text. The short dash-long dash lines represent the 1-\u03c3 error associated to our Av measurement presented in Table 1.\n\n8. Conclusions\nIn this paper we have discussed the extinction-distance method\nfor determining distances to PNe, motivated by the opportunity\nprovided by the IPHAS survey with its wide application in the\nGalaxy.\nThe technique is presented and the derivation of the distance\nand its error is put on a formal mathematical basis. We find a\nmean value of the slope b = 6.53 * 10\u22124 mag/pc for the galactic\nextinction distance curve, valid for the analyzed region of the\nsky.\nThe numerical and physical reasons that can affect the measurement of the interstellar extinction toward a PN are then discussed. All these, which add to the unavoidable measurement\n\nerrors the effects of an incomplete knowledge of the physics of\ninterstellar dust through the Galaxy and inside PNe, have to be\ntaken into account every time the method is applied.\nIn spite of these uncertainties which will need to be addressed in future, we have computed extinction distances for a\nsample of 70 PNe, which is the largest sample of Galactic PNe\nto which the technique has been applied. In the best conditions,\nwhen the extinction measurements of the PNe are of good quality and the lines of sight are well behaved in terms of their associated distance-extinction maps, the errors in the PN distances\ncan be as good as 20%, which is a very promising result for a\nwider application of the method. Unfortunately this is not the\ncommon situation for the current data set. As previously mentioned, the uncertainty on the visual extinction for the whole set\n\n\f8\n\nDistances of Planetary Nebulae: IPHAS extinction distances to Planetary Nebulae\n\nFig. 5. Extinction-Distance curves for the second group of six nebulae presented in Table 1. For all graphics the abscissae are in pc,\nthe ordinates, in visual magnitudes. The horizontal lines represent the visual extinctions corresponding to the nebulae considered in\nthe text. The short dash-long dash lines represent the 1-\u03c3 error associated to our Av measurement presented in Table 1.\nof nebulae is \u03c3 = 0.88, which implies much larger errors in the\ndistances. For a subsample of the PNe considered, extinction is\nmore precisely measured, and for the two cases for which we\ncould determine the associated error, an uncertainty of 35% on\nthe distance is estimated. This can be taken as a figure to be associated with PNe for which good spectroscopic data exist. A\nmain message of this study is that a careful determination of the\nnebular extinction is mandatory to limit the errors in a way that\nreliable distances can be obtained for individual objects. In this\nrespect, our plan is to improve the extinction measurements for\na significant sample of Galactic PNe.\nWe have then compared these new extinction distances with\nother statistical methods. Some of the methods considered (Cahn\net al. 1992, and van de Steene & Zijlstra 1994) provide distances\n\nthat are generally larger than our determinations, and in general\nthe dispersion is quite high. This emphasizes the large 1-\u03c3 dispersion in the statistical distances, and the dangers in relying on\nthe determination of a statistical distance to a PN without considering the particular characteristic of a nebula.\nConcluding, the analysis in this paper demonstrates the increased potential of the extinction method gained with the availability of surveys like IPHAS, which provide precise photometric data in large areas of sky. This opens the possibility of making a significant step forward in the calibration of the PN distance scale in the Galaxy, and in our understanding of important\nissues such as the properties of the dust distribution within the\nGalactic disc, and the possible importance of dust associated to\nPNe.\n\n\fDistances of Planetary Nebulae: IPHAS extinction distances to Planetary Nebulae\n\n9\n\nTable 2.
