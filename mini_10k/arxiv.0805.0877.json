The microelectronic industry is moving toward\nvery compact, autonomous and pervasive systems which use\nmulti-physics signal processing, e.g, embedded sensors and\nsensor networks. However, the energy supply autonomy of\nsuch systems remains the key problem, and on of the\nsolutions can be provided by harvesting energy from the\nenvironment. Recently a keen interest has been demonstrated\ntoward harvesting of energy of environment vibrations,\nbeing motivated by applications of sensor network in\nmoving objects (transportation...).\nA mechanical energy harvester is composed from a\nmechanical resonator, an electromechanical transducer and a\nconditioning circuit achieving the energy transfer from the\ntransducer toward the electrical load. In this paper, we deal\nwith a capacitive (electrostatic) transducer. Such systems are\nattractive for two reasons : firstly, they can be fabricated in\nsilicon micromachined process compatible with CMOS\nclean rooms, secondly, in difference with piezoelectric-based\n\n\u00a9EDA Publishing/DTIP 2008\n\nsystems, they are more likely to provide a large frequency\npassband.\nHowever, study and design of a capacitive harvester are\nchallenging tasks, since they require a design of a complex\nconditioning circuit managing the electrical charge flow on\nthe transducer capacitor, and an analysis of coupled\nelectromechanical behavior. For this reason a reliable model\nof the system is needed for the design.\nThe object of our study it the circuit presented in fig. 1,\nfirstly introduced in [1]. This circuit is composed from a\ncharge pump and a flyback circuit. The idea of energy\nharvesting is resumed in three steps : putting an electrical\ncharge on a variable capacitor when the capacitance is high,\nreducing the capacitance thanks to the mechanical\nvibrations, discharging the capacitor. Following the formula\nW=Q2/(2C), the discharge energy is higher than the energy\nspent to charge the capacitor.\nHowever, a practical implementation requires a more\ncomplex harvesting cycle, related to the need of automatic\ncharging and discharging of the variable capacitor which is\nachieved by a charge pump.\nII.\n\nCHARGE PUMP OPERATION\n\nThe charge pump is composed of three capacitors : a\nlarge-capacitance Cres (~1 \u03bcF), a smaller Cstore (~1 nF) and\nCvar which is the variable transducer capacitance and which\nvaries typically between several tens and several hundreds of\npicofarads. Cres capacitor is supposed to be big, so to keep a\nconstant voltage during all phases of the system operation.\nThe role of the charge pump is to transfer the charges from\nCres toward Cstore. Since Cstore < Cres, this transfer\nrequires an external energy: the latter is provided from the\nmechanical domain through the variations of the capacitance\nCvar (details can be found in [1]). The energy harvested\nduring each pump is accumulated in the difference between\nthe voltages of Cres and Cstore capacitors, or in other words,\nin the energy of an equivalent capacitor composed from\nseries connection of Cres and Cstore and charged to a\nvoltage equal to the difference between Cres and Cstore\nvoltage :\n\nISBN: 978-2-35500-006-5\n\n\fFigure 1.

This tendency is also demonstrated\nin the plots on the fig. 3. Hence, there is a cycle number at\nwhich the pump harvests the maximal amount of energy.\nSupposing that the vibrations are periodical, and each pump\ncycle takes exactly the same time, one can see that there is\nan operating mode at which the pump produce a maximum\npower. This is a theoretical physical limit of the charge\npump performance, for the given capacitance values, ideal\ndiodes and given V0 voltage, and it is very important to\nknow it.\nIII\n\n\u2248\n\n(1)\n\n2\n\n(Vstore \u2212 Vres )\nn\n2\nwhere \u2206W1->n is the energy accumulated by the pump charge\nduring n pump cycles, Vstoren is Cstore voltage at the end of\nthe nth cycle.\nObserving the QV diagram of the charge pump operation\n(fig. 2), one can see that the curve describing the cycle is\nchanging each cycle. Indeed, if at the beginning (point 1)\nVres=Vvar=Vstore=V0, and Cvar=Cmax, the first cycle will\nbe triangular (black). However, the second cycle will contain\nan addidional point (1bis), thus will be larger and less high\nthat the first one, and will be a trapeze (red). It is possible to\nsee that at cycle n the point 1bis is situated at V=Vstore1, and\nthat at each cycle Vstore increases, thus, the cycle becomes\nlarger. At the same time, the minimal charge of the variable\ncapacitor increases, so the cycle becomes thinner (the line\n1\u21922 is always situated at fixed Q-coordinate equal to\nCmaxV0). From the left and from the right sides, the QV\ndiagram is bounded by the lines corresponding to Cmin and\nCmax values of the variable capacitance : Q=CminV and\nQ=CmaxV. Hence the lines Q=CminV and Q= CmaxV0 (line\n1\u21921bis ) fixe the maximal value of Vstore, which is equal to\nV0Cmax/Cmin and called \"saturation voltage\". When Vstore\nis close to Vstoresat, the cycle is very thin, and at n\u2192\u221e it\ndegenerates to a line.\n\nHere we will give the guidelines of the estimation of the\ntheoretical maximal power.\nThe problem is resumed in the following way. It is\nrequired to find the maximum of the function :\n\u2212 \u2206W\n\u2206W (n) = \u2206W\n1\u2192 n\n1 \u2192 n \u2212 1 , (2)\nWhere \u2206W1AEn is determined by the formula (1).\nThe formula for the value of the voltage Vstoren was\nderived in [1] :\nVstoren\n\nn\n\uf8ee\uf8eb C max \uf8f6\uf8eb\nC max\n\uf8f6\n= V0 \uf8ef\uf8ec 1 \u2212\n\uf8f7\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ef\uf8f0\uf8ed C min \uf8f8\uf8ed Cstore + C max \uf8f8\n\n+\n\nC max \uf8f9\n\n\uf8fa (3)\n\uf8fb\n\nC min \uf8fa\n\nLooking for the maximum of (2) by n (using (1) and (3)),\nit is possible to find the number n of the most \"efficient\"\ncycle. It is impossible to find n in closed form, so, a numeric\nanalysis is necessary.\nHowever, it is possible to have an intuitive idea from the\nfollowing considerations.\nIf Cmin << Cmax, for low n, the evolution of Vstore is\nlinear :\n\n\uf8ee C max \uf8f9\nVstoren \u2248 V0 \uf8ef1 +\n\u22c5n\n\uf8f0 Cstore \uf8fa\uf8fb (4)\n(this formula is obtained by limited development in power\nseries).\nUsing (4), it is possible to express \u2206W(n) :\n\n\u2206W (n) =\n\nFigure 2. QV diagram of the charge pump operation\n\nESTIMATION OF THE MAXIMAL POWER.\n\nC max V02 C max\n(2n \u2212 1)\n2\nCstore\n(5)\n\nThis function has no maximum under the hypothesis\nwhich have been made. However, in practice (when Cmin is\nnon-zero), there will be a saturation of Vstore, and from\nsome n and the corresponding Vstore \u2206W(n) will start to\ndecrease and will become zero when n is infinite (fig. 3).\nThis reasoning proves that there is a one and only one\ncycle of charge pump for which the latter generate the\nmaximum power. The very important conclusion is that the\nindex of this cycle, and more generally, the optimal\noperation zone of the pump charge, can be defined using\nonly information about Vstore.\n\nIt is known that the area of the a clockwise QV cycle is\nnumerically equal to the harvested energy. Visually, it is\npossible to see that the first cycle (black) has a smaller area\n\n\u00a9EDA Publishing/DTIP 2008\n\nISBN: 978-2-35500-006-5\n\n\f9-11 April 2008\nend Cres voltages which we call V1 and V2 corresponding to\nsome n1 and n2. Only numeric optimization can provide the\nexact values given the exponential nature of the\ncorresponding equations. The average harvested power to be\noptimized is given by :\n\nP (n , n ) =\n1 2\n\nFigure 3. Harvested energy of the pump charge and the voltages on Cstore\nand Cres capacitors versus the number of the pump cycle.\n\nIV\n\nENSURING AN OPTIMAL CHARGE PUMP OPERATION\n\nAs showed the preceding demonstration, the charge pump\noperation is not symmetric in time, and only during some\nlimited time interval the pump generates a maximal power.\nTo guarantee a continuous power generation, a flyback\ncircuit is needed. Its role is twofold : firstly, to return the\ncharge pump to some earlier state (not obviously initial\nwhere Vstore=V0) so to keep its operation in the optimal\nzone, secondly, to extract the harvested energy from the\ncharge pump and to provide it to the load.\nThis is achieved with the flyback circuit whose\narchitecture has been inspired from the BUCK DC-DC\nconverter architecture (fig. 1). It composed from the diode\nD3 and the inductor L. The principle of operating is the\nfollowing.\nWhen the switch becomes on, the LC circuit CresCstoreL\n(in which the two capacitors are connected in series) starts to\noscillate with the following initial conditions: IL=0,\nVC=Vstore-Vres. The (composed) capacitor discharges, and\nthe inductor accumulated the energy in its magnetic field.\nWhen the difference between Vstore and Vres decreases\nsufficiently to return the charge pump at the beginning of the\noptimal operation zone, the switch opens and the inductor\ndischarges on Cres capacitance providing to it electrical\ncharges extracted from the ground. This last phase allows to\ncompensate the loss of the charges of the circuit due to the\nload and to the parasitic leakage.\nFrom the above analysis of the charge pump, an ideal\ncircuit operation would be such that the charge pump\nachieves only the cycle corresponding to the optimal n and\nVstore, and, at the end of this cycle the flyback circuit return\nthe pump at the state corresponding to the beginning of this\ncycle.\nHowever, such operation would be ideal only in theory. In\npractice some losses are always associated with the flyback\noperation (losses in inductor, switching power etc.). For this\nreason, the frequency of the flyback circuit activation should\nbe as low as possible. From the other side, enlarging the\noperating zone of the charge pump to several cycles leads to\ndegradation of the harvested power. These two opposite\nfactors provide and optimal (compromise) definition of the\noptimal operation zone of the charge pump : the start and\n\n\u00a9EDA Publishing/DTIP 2008\n\n\u2206W\n1\u2192 n\n\n2\n\n\u2212 \u2206W\n\u2212 Pswitch\n1\u2192 n\n1\n, (6)\nT (n \u2212 n )\n2\n1\n\nwhere Pswitch is the energy loss associated with each\nswitching.\nThe maximum of this two-variable function is to be found\nnumerically. An example of the corresponding surface is\ngiven in fig. 4. The resulting system operation is presented in\nthe diagram of fig. 5.\n\nP\n\nn2\nn1\nFigure 4 Example of the surface shape P(n1, n2) for the harvester of fig. 1\nwith component parameters given in below.\n\nFigure 5 Diagrams demonstrating an optimal circuit operation on a limited\nzone Vstore(n)\n\nV\n\nOPTIMAL SWITCH OPERATION AND SWITCH\nFONCTIONAL MODEL\n\nThe above considerations suggest the following switching\nalgorithm : the switch should become on (activate the\nflyback) when Vstore reaches the V2 value corresponding to\nthe right limit of the optimal operation zone, and become off\nwhen Vstore decreases to V1 corresponding to the left limit\nof this zone. In addition, the switch should remember its\ncurrent state, hence it should be a finite automaton with onebit memory (fig. 6).\n\nISBN: 978-2-35500-006-5\n\n\f9-11 April 2008\n\nFigure 6 Functional diagram of the switch. V1, V2 are the\nlimits values of the Vstore voltage (fig. 5)\nThe parameters V1 and V2 are found from the\nmaximization of (6). In this way, switching is entirely driven\nby the internal state of the circuit. Under the hypothesis of\nthe constant amplitude of the capacitance variation (i.e.,\nfixed Cmax and Cmin), the optimal power generation level\nis guaranteed with any variation in the external vibration\ntiming.\nIn this context, the switch is a complex \"intelligent\"\ndevice driven by Vstore voltage and internal algorithm.\nVI\n\nFigure 8. Capacitance versus proof mass displacement for\nthe resonator used in the model.\n\nMODEL OF THE HARVESTER\n\nThe system of fig. 1 was modeled using a physical VHDLAMS model for the electromechanical transducer and the\nresonator, using an ELDO model for the electrical part, and\nusing a functional VHDL-AMS model for he switch [2].\nThe model of the resonator and the transducer was\nobtained using the measurement results of a real device we\npresented in [3] (fig. 7). For this device, fig. 8 presents the\nvariation of the transducer capacitance versus proof mass\ndisplacement. This plot provides the information about maxto-min ratio of the transducer capacitance, i.e., about 3.5.\nThe whole system was modeled in CADENCE\nenvironement using AdvanceMS mixed simulatoir. Fig. 9\nprovides the schematic view of the system.\n\nFigure 9. Schematic view of the harvester modeled in CADENCE\nenvironment. Cres=1 \u03bcF, Cstore=3.3 nF, L=2.5 \u03bcH, magnitude of external\nacceleration (V0 voltage source) 10 ms-2, external vibration frequency\n298Hz. The mass, elastic and damping constant of the resonator model were\nrespectively of 46.0*10-6 kg, 152.6 Nm-1 and 2.19*10-3 Nsm-1. The starting\nvoltage of the charge pump (Vres voltage) was set to 5 V.\n\nVII\n\nSIMULATION RESULTS\n\nThe plots of the fig. 10 demonstrates an autonomous\noperation of the harvester. The voltages V1 and V2 in the\nswitch functional mode were set to 6.5 and 13 V, the starting\nvoltage (V0) being set to 5 V. The simulated plots are in very\ngood adequacy with the theoretical analysis. From these\nplots a very interesting phenomenon can be observed. One\ncan notice that when the Vstore voltage is at its minimum\n(just after the flyback phases), the amplitude of vibrations\nincreases slightly. This is a consequence of a complex nonlinear coupling between mechanical and electrical domains,\nand a demonstration of the fundamental law of the\nconservation of the total energy of the global system.\n\nFigure 7.

However, when one is interested by harvesting a\nmaximal energy from the mechanical domain, mechanical\nand electrical energy levels are comparable, and the\nmentioned coupling phenomenon cannot be neglected : a\nmore complex analysis is needed to estimate the system\nperformance. To demonstrate it in a very simple way,\nsuppose Cmin is zero or very small (which is physically not\nimpossible), thus, from the formula (5) there is no upper\nlimit for the harvested energy ! Obviously, if a realistic\nmechanical system is present, starting from some Vstore the\nvibration amplitude will decrease, Cmin-Cmax range will\nreduce, invalidating the formula.\nVIII CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES.\nHarvesting of vibration energy using capacitive transducer\nis a very interesting engineer and scientific problem. In this\npaper we proposed an approach of synchronous feedback\ncommand of the harvesting phases. We proposed a\nmethodology of maximization of the harvested energy flow\n(power). The described very simple control algorithm can be\nimproved so to take into consideration the possible\nvariations of the vibration magnitude, for an appropriate\nadaptation of the voltages V1 and V2.\nThe proposed mixed model of the harvester is very useful\nfor the study and the design of the system, mainly, because it\nrelies on the physical relations between the components, in\ndifference with SDF (signal data flow) Simulink-liked\nmodels. The observed electromechanical coupling has yet to\nbe studied and understood in a more fundamental way.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\n\nThis work is partially funded by the French Research\nAgency (ANR, Agence Nationale pour la Recherche), and is\nsupported by the French competitiveness cluster \"Ville et\nMobilit\u00e9 Durable\"\nFigure 10.

Qvar : charge on the transducer,\nx : displacement of the proof mass, Force and F : electrical force generated\nby the transducer, VD3: voltage on the diode D3\n\nIndeed, when the voltage of Cstore is high, during the\nmotion from Cmax to Cmin, the transducer must cross the\npotential barrier from Vres (nearly constant and equal to V0)\nto Vstore : this appeals a relatively big amount of energy\nfrom the mechanical domain. This phenomenon appears as\nan electrostatic force generated by the transducer which\ntends to slow down the mass motion. Thus, the higher is\nVstore, the lower is the amplitude of motions.\nThis observation highlights inherent limits of reasoning in\npurely electrical or mechanical domain. Indeed, nearly all\nanalysis of the pump charge operation are based on the\nhypothesis of a constant-amplitude transducer capacitance\nvariation. However, this is only valid if the energy stored in\n\n\u00a9EDA Publishing/DTIP 2008\n\nREFERENCES\n[1]\n[2]\n\n[3]\n\nB. C. Yen, J. H.
