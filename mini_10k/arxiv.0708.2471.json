Work supported by ANR grant NT05-3-43374 \"GenoPhy\".\n\n1\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction.\n\nAn intense activity has been devoted to the study of various field theories defined on Moyal\nspaces (see e.g. [1, 2]). These noncommutative field theories involve most of the features\nstemming from noncommutative geometry [3, 4] and are thus interesting in themselves.\nThis interest was further increased by the observation that somewhat similar noncommutative field theories might emerge from some limiting regime of string theory and matrix\ntheory in magnetic backgrounds [5] (See also [6]). In this talk, I will report recent progress\n[7] toward the construction of renormalisable actions for gauge theories defined on noncommutative Moyal spaces which so far remains an unsolved and challenging problem.\nThe corresponding results have been obtained in collaboration with A. de Goursac and\nR. Wulkenhaar [7]. Our results and conclusions agree with those obtained recently by H.\nGrosse and M. Wohlgennant, as reported in [8]. In noncommutative geometry, the commutative algebras of functions defined on differentiable manifolds (which may be viewed\nas modelling the coordinates spaces) are replaced by associative algebras interpreted as\nalgebras of functions on \"noncommutative spaces\". Within this algebraic framework,\nnatural noncommutative analogues of the main geometrical objects usually involved in\nfield theories can be defined thus opening the way for the construction of noncommutative analogues of field theories (see e.g. [9]). The relevant configuration spaces for the\nnoncommutative field theories are modules over the associative algebras, naturally interpreted as noncommutative analogues for the set of sections of vector bundles, while the\nlinear spaces of the derivations of these algebras can be viewed as the noncommutative\ncounterparts of the spaces of vector fields of commutative spaces . This finally permits\none to define natural noncommutative extensions of connections and curvatures [3, 4].\nOne example of associative algebra, among many others, is provided by the associative\nMoyal algebras [10, 11] which will then play the role of \"noncommutative Moyal spaces\".\nNote that Moyal algebras have been considered in the mathematical literature a long time\nago from various viewpoints (see e.g. [12] and references therein).\nIt is known that the simplest generalisations of scalar theories to Moyal space suffer\nfrom the UV/IR-mixing [13, 14], which makes the renormalisability very unlikely. Recall\nthat the UV/IR-mixing results from the existence of potentially dangerous non-planar\ndiagrams which, albeit UV finite, become singular at exceptional low external momenta.\nThis generates UV divergences in higher order diagrams in which they are involved as\nsubdiagrams, signalling that that UV and IR scales are non-trivially related which should\ninvalidate a Wilson-type renormalisation scheme [15, 16]. An appealing solution to the\nUV/IR-mixing has been recently proposed by Grosse and Wulkenhaar [17, 18] within\nthe noncommutative \u03c64 model (\u03c6 real-valued) on the 4-dimensional Moyal space. They\nshowed that the UV/IR-mixing can be suppressed by supplementing the initial action with\na harmonic oscillator term leading to a renormalisable quantum field theory. The initial\nbeautiful proof [17] performed within the so-called matrix-base formalism was further\nsimplified through a reformulation into the (position) x-space formalism in [19]. Other\nrenormalisable noncommutative matter field theories on Moyal spaces have then been\nidentified. One is the complex-valued scalar theory studied in [19] which is nothing but a\nmodified version of the LSZ model [20, 21] 1 . As far as fermionic theories are concerned, a\n1\n\nNote that the scalar theory in [22] is super-renormalisable. Besides, interesting solvable noncommutative scalar field theories have also been considered in [23, 24, 25]\n\n2\n\n\fMoyal space version of the Gross-Neveu model [26]), called the orientable noncommutative\nGross-Neveu model, has been recently shown to be renormalisable to all orders [27] (see\nalso [28]). This latter noncommutative theories still exhibit some residual UV/IR-mixing,\neven in the presence of the suitable extension of the harmonic term of [17], which however\ndoes not prevent the theory from being perturbatively renormalisable. This indicates\nthat further investigations are needed to clarify the actual role of various generalisations\nof the above-mentioned harmonic oscillator term, of the related covariance under the\nLangmann-Szabo duality [29] and of their impact in the control of the UV/IR-mixing and\nrenormalisability.\nSo far, the construction of a renormalisable gauge theory on Moyal spaces remains\nstill unsolved and appears to be a quite challenging problem. The naive noncommutative\nextension of the pure Yang-Mills action on Moyal spaces has UV/IR mixing [30, 31] which\nmakes its renormalisability quite unlikely unless it is suitably modified. Unfortunately,\nthe \"harmonic solution\" proposed in [17] cannot be merely extended to gauge theories on\nMoyal spaces. Finding such a suitable extension would first amount to determine whether\nor not the naive noncommutative Yang-Mills action can be supplemented by additional\ngauge invariant terms providing a natural \"gauge theory counterpart\" of those harmonic\nterms. As shown in [7] and as it will be explained during this talk, this can be conveniently\nachieved by computing at the one-loop order the noncommutative effective gauge theory\naction obtained by integrating out the matter degree of freedom of a matter field theory\nwith harmonic term minimally coupled to an external gauge potential. The calculation\nperformed within the x-space formalism singles out [7] a class of gauge invariant actions\ngiven by\nZ\n\u0010 \u03b1\n\u0011\n\u03a9\u2032\n\u03ba\n2\nS = d4 x\nF\n\u22c6\nF\n+\n{A\n,\nA\n}\n+\nA\n\u22c6\nA\n(1.1)\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bc\n\u03bd\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u22c6\n4g 2\n4g 2\n2\nthat may well involve (or may be used as a starting point to construct) suitable candidates for renormalisable actions for gauge theory defined on Moyal spaces. A similar\ninvestigation has been carried out independently by H. Grosse and M. Wohlgenannt [8].\nThe corresponding basic ingredients (gauge transformations and starting matter action)\nand the computational tools (related to the matrix basis) are different from ours. But\nthe resulting effective action and the related conclusions agree completely with ours. In\n(1.1), A\u03bc denotes a specific gauge covariant tensorial form, linked with the existence of a\ncanonical gauge invariant connection [32, 33] appearing naturally within the present noncommutative framework. It is related to the so called covariant coordinates in the string\ntheory literature (see e.g [1]). The 2nd term term built from the anticommutator and the\n3rd term may be viewed as \"gauge counterparts\" of the harmonic term introduced in [17]\n(\u03b1, \u03a9\u2032 , \u03ba and g are real parameters). Furthermore, the 3rd term involves a mass term\nfor the gauge potential while such a bare mass term for a gauge potential is forbidden\nby gauge invariance in commutative Yang-Mills theories. It turns out that the presence\nof these quadratic and quartic terms in A\u03bc is reflected in a non-vanishing vacuum expectation value for the gauge potential A\u03bc , a rather unusual feature for a Yang-Mills type\ntheory. Note that non trivial vacuum configurations have been studied recently in [34]\nwithin scalar models with harmonic term. The consequences of this non-trivial vacuum\nfor the above class of gauge theories remain to be understood and properly controlled in\nview of a further gauge-fixing of a (classical) gauge action stemming from (1.1) combined\nwith a suitable regularisation scheme.\n3\n\n\f2\n\nThe Moyal algebra.\n\nIn this section, I collect some basic mathematical tools involved in the definition of the\nMoyal algebra. The Moyal product and the Moyal spaces are deeply rooted in Quantum Mechanics through the operator calculus introduced by H. Weyl [35]. The subsequent formulation of Quantum Mechanics on a classical phase space was carried out in\n[36, 37] thanks to the introduction of a twisted product, hereafter called the Moyal product product, together with the introduction of some analog of the quantum mechanical\ncommutation relations, called the Moyal brackets. For more mathematical details, see\ne.g [12], [10, 11] and the references therein. Note that the Moyal spaces can be related\nto spectral triples, as shown in [38]. In the following, I will deal with four-dimensional\nMoyal spaces. The extension to arbitrary (even) dimensional spaces is trivial. Let S and\nS \u2032 denote respectively the space of complex-valued Schwartz functions on R4 with fast\ndecay at infinity and the space of tempered distributions on R4 . Let \u0398\u03bc\u03bd be the invertible\nconstant skew-symmetric matrix\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\n0 \u22121\nJ 0\n(2.1)\n, J=\n\u0398=\u03b8\n1 0\n0 J\nwhere \u03b8 has mass dimension \u22122. The associative Moyal product, denoted hereafter by a\n\u22c6 symbol, can be first defined on S \u00d7 S by2\nZ\n1\n1\n(f \u22c6 h)(x) =\nd4 y d4 k f (x + \u0398.k) h(x + y)eik.y\n4\n(2\u03c0)\n2\nZ\n1\n\u22121\n= 4 4 d4 yd4zf (x + y)h(x + z)e\u2212i2y\u0398 z\n\u03c0 \u03b8\nZ\ni\n1\nd4 k1 d4 k2 f\u02c6(k1 )\u0125(k2 \u2212 k1 )eik2 x e\u2212 2 k1 \u0398k2 ,\n=\n(2.2)\n8\n(2\u03c0)\nfor any f, h \u2208 S such that (f \u22c6h)\u2208S. From (2.2), one easily verifies that (f \u22c6g)\u22c6h=f \u22c6(g\u22c6h),\nf \u22c6 g6=g \u22c6 f and (f \u22c6 h)\u2020 =h\u2020 \u22c6 f \u2020 where \u2020 denotes the complex conjugation, \u2200f, g, h\u2208S.\nOne has the tracial property\nZ\nZ\n4\nd x(f \u22c6 g)(x) = d4 xf (x).g(x)\n(2.3)\nwhere the symbol \".\" is the (commutative) usual product among functions. This, combined with the associativity of the \u22c6-product implies the cyclicity property\nZ\nZ\nZ\n4\n4\nd x(f1 \u22c6 f2 \u22c6 f3 )(x) = d x(f2 \u22c6 f3 \u22c6 f1 )(x) = d4 x(f3 \u22c6 f1 \u22c6 f2 )(x) \u2200f1 , f2 , f3 \u2208 S\n\n(2.4)\n\nS is not large enough to be physically interesting. In particular, it has no unit. However,\nit can be enlarged to an algebra of tempered distributions using duality of linear spaces\nsuch that the associativity of the \u22c6-product and the involution inherited from the complex\nconjugation are preserved (see e.g [10, 11]). The \u22c6-product is first extended to S \u2032 \u00d7 S\n2\n\n\u0398.k \u2261 \u0398\u03bc\u03bd k \u03bd and X\u0302 is the Fourier transform of X\n\n4\n\n\fand to S \u00d7 S \u2032 using the duality of linear spaces: one defines T \u22c6 f and f \u22c6 T through\n\u2032\nhT \u22c6 f, hi=hT,\nR 4 f \u22c6 hi, hf \u22c6 T, hi= hT, h \u22c6 f i, \u2200f, h\u2208S, \u2200T \u2208S where the duality bracket is\nhf, gi\u2261 d xf (x).g(x). Thanks to the smoothening properties of the \u22c6-product together\nwith (2.3), (T \u22c6 f )\u2208S \u2032 and (f \u22c6 T )\u2208S \u2032 while the unit I\u2208S \u2032 plays the role of the neutral\nelement for the \u22c6-product [10, 11]. Now, let L, R and M denote the following subspaces\nof S \u2032\n\b\n\b\nL = T \u2208 S \u2032 : T \u22c6 f \u2208 S, \u2200f \u2208 S , R = T \u2208 S \u2032 : f \u22c6 T \u2208 S, \u2200f \u2208 S . (2.5)\nM = L \u2229 R.\n\n(2.6)\n\nThe algebra M defines the Moyal algebra, an associative, unital, involutive \u22c6-algebra. It\nis a very large algebra involving the plane waves eipx , the \u03b4 Dirac distribution and the\n\"coordinate\" functions x\u03bc satisfying\n[x\u03bc , x\u03bd ]\u22c6 = i\u0398\u03bc\u03bd\n\n(2.7)\n\nwhere [a, b]\u22c6 \u2261 a \u22c6 b \u2212 b \u22c6 a. Notice that this relation, well defined on M but not on S,\nmay be used, and is actually often used in the literature, as a convenient substitute for a\ndefinition of the Moyal algebra. Useful properties of the \u22c6-product valid on M are\n\u2202\u03bc (f \u22c6 h) = \u2202\u03bc f \u22c6 h + f \u22c6 \u2202\u03bc h,\n(f \u22c6 h)\u2020 = h\u2020 \u22c6 f \u2020 ,\n[x\u03bc , f ]\u22c6 = i\u0398\u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bd f,\ni\ni\nx\u03bc \u22c6 f = (x\u03bc .f ) + \u0398\u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bd f,\nx\u03bc (f \u22c6 h) = (x\u03bc .f ) \u22c6 h \u2212 \u0398\u03bc\u03bd f \u22c6 \u2202\u03bd h,\n2\n2\n\n(2.8a)\n(2.8b)\n\nfor any f, h \u2208 M. One of the most salient properties of the \u22c6-product is its non-locality\nwhich is obvious from (2.2). To arrive at (2.6), one has to extend the \u22c6-product on S \u2032 \u00d7 L\nand R \u00d7 S \u2032 through hT \u22c6 TL , f i=hT, TL \u22c6 f i, hTR \u22c6 T, f i=hT, f \u22c6 TR i, \u2200T \u2208S \u2032 , \u2200T \u2208S \u2032 ,\n\u2200TL \u2208 L, \u2200TR \u2208R, \u2200f \u2208S so that (T \u22c6 TL )\u2208S \u2032 and (TR \u22c6 T )\u2208S \u2032 . Then, one can show that\nfor any (T1 , T2 )\u2208M, (T1 \u22c6T2 )\u2208M. The associativity of the \u22c6-product extends easily on M\nas a mere consequence of the definition of the Moyal algebra together with the definition\nof the duality bracket. It is easy to realize that M has a natural involution inherited\nfrom the complex conjugation operation acting on S combined with the usual relation\nhT \u2020 , f i=hT, f \u2020i\u22c6 , \u2200T \u2208S \u2032 , \u2200f \u2208S. In particular, the relation (T1 \u22c6 T2 )\u2020 =T2\u2020 \u22c6 T1\u2020 can be\nextended on M.\n\n3\n\nMatter fields, connections, gauge potentials\n\nBefore presenting the main steps of the computation, it is useful to clarify the mathematical status of the various ingredients that will be involved, that is, matter fields,\nconnections, gauge potentials, curvatures. For a larger amount of mathematical details,\nsee e.g [3, 4], [32, 33]. The framework presented below corresponds to the simplest option where the relevant module is chosen to be the algebra itself. It is also the most\nwidely studied situation in the literature, giving rise to the so called \"noncommutative\nfield theories on flat Moyal spaces\". This has been partly motivated because a similar\nnoncommutative structure was suggested to emerge possibly from some limiting regimes\nof string theory and matrix theory in magnetic backgrounds [5, 6].\n5\n\n\f3.1\n\nThe free module case\n\nIn the following, the Moyal algebra M is assumed to be endowed with a differential\ncalculus based on the derivations \u2202\u03bc . The usual concept of connections defined on vector\nbundles in ordinary geometry can be consistently generalised in noncommutative geometry\nto connections on (projective) modules over an associative algebra. This is the route that\nwill be followed here. Let H be a right M-module, equipped with a Hermitian structure\nh, i.e a sesquilinear map h : H \u00d7 H \u2192 M verifying\nh(m1 \u22c6 f1 , m2 \u22c6 f2 ) = f1\u2020 \u22c6 h(m1 , m2 ) \u22c6 f2 ,\n\n\u2200f1 , f2 \u2208 M,\n\n\u2200m1 , m2 \u2208 H\n\n(3.1)\n\nA connection is defined algebraically by a linear map \u2207\u03bc : H \u2192 H from H to H verifying:\n\u2207\u03bc (m \u22c6 f ) = \u2207\u03bc (m) \u22c6 f + m \u22c6 \u2202\u03bc f, \u2200m \u2208 H,\n\n\u2200f \u2208 M\n\n(3.2)\n\nThe connection is further assumed to preserve the hermitian structure, that is\n\u2202\u03bc h(m1 , m2 ) = h(\u2207\u03bc m1 , m2 ) + h(m1 , \u2207\u03bc m2 ),\n\n\u2200m1 , m2 \u2208 H.\n\n(3.3)\n\nUp to now, the module has not been specified except it has been assumed for definiteness\nto be a right M-module. The choice giving rise to the above mentioned noncommutative\nfield theories corresponds to H = M, that is, the algebra plays the role of the module.\nThis is the most simple choice for H which thus becomes a free module. The corresponding\nextension of the present material to the case H = M\u00d7N is straightforward.\nThe choice H = M has an immediate consequence. Since the relevant module involves\nnow the unit, it follows from (3.2) that the connection is entirely determined by its action\n\u2207\u03bc (I) on the unit I \u2208 M, denoted by\n\u2207A\n\u03bc (I) \u2261 \u2212iA\u03bc ,\n\n(3.4)\n\nIndeed, by setting m=I in (3.2), one readily obtains\nA\n\u2207A\n\u03bc (I \u22c6 f ) = \u2207\u03bc (I) \u22c6 f + \u2202\u03bc f \u2261 \u2202\u03bc f \u2212 iA\u03bc \u22c6 f\n\n(3.5)\n\nThis therefore can serve as defining a noncommutative analog of the gauge potential A\u03bc\nin M. Furthermore, it can be realized that for H = M, a hermitian structure is provided\nby\nh(f1 , f2 ) = f1\u2020 \u22c6 f2\n\n(3.6)\n\nwhich ensures that the above connections are hermitian connections provided A\u2020\u03bc =A\u03bc .\n\n3.2\n\nGauge transformations\n\nFirst recall that when H 6= M, a morphism of module, says \u03b3, satisfies by definition\n\u03b3(m \u22c6 f ) = \u03b3(m) \u22c6 f,\n\n\u2200m \u2208 H,\n\n6\n\n\u2200f \u2208 M\n\n(3.7)\n\n\fIn the present situation, where H = M is assumed, the gauge transformations hereafter\ndenoted by \u03b3 are determined by the automorphisms of the module M preserving the\nhermitian structure h: \u03b3 \u2208 Auth (M)3 . Namely, the gauge transformations must satisfy\n\u03b3(f ) = \u03b3(I \u22c6 f ) = \u03b3(I) \u22c6 f , \u2200f \u2208 M\n\u0001\nh \u03b3(f1 ), \u03b3(f2 ) = h(f1 , f2 ) \u2200f1 , f2 \u2208 M\n,\n\n(3.8a)\n(3.8b)\n\n\u03b3(I)\u2020 \u22c6 \u03b3(I) = I\n\n(3.9)\n\nIt can be verified that the combination of (3.8b) with (3.6) applied to \u03b3(I) implies automatically\n\nFrom this, it follows that the gauge transformations are entirely determined by \u03b3(I) \u2208\nU(M), where U(M) is the group of unitary elements of M. From now on, we set\n\u03b3(I) \u2261 g\n\n(3.10)\n\nAccording to (3.8a), the action of the gauge group as given above on any matter field\n\u03c6 \u2208 M can be defined by\n\u03c6g = g \u22c6 \u03c6\n(3.11)\nfor any g \u2208 U(M). This simply expresses the fact that the gauge transformation is a\nmorphism of module. In more physical words, this may be viewed as the noncommutative\nanalogue of the transformation of the matter fields under the \"fundamental representation\nof the gauge group\". Note that one has obviously g \u2020 \u22c6 g = g \u22c6 g \u2020 = I in view of (3.9).\nThe action of U(M) on the connection \u2207A\n\u03bc is defined by\n\u03b3\nA \u22121\n(\u2207A\n\u03bc ) (\u03c6) = \u03b3(\u2207\u03bc (\u03b3 \u03c6)),\n\n\u2200\u03c6 \u2208 M.\n\n(3.12)\n\nBy further using \u03b3(\u03c6) = \u03b3(I \u22c6 \u03c6) = g \u22c6 \u03c6 together with the expression of the covariant\nderivative\n\u2207A\n\u03bc (\u03c6) = \u2202\u03bc \u03c6 \u2212 iA\u03bc \u22c6 \u03c6\n\n(3.13)\n\ng\ng\n(\u2207A\n\u03bc ) \u2261 \u2202\u03bc \u2212 iA\u03bc\n\n(3.14)\n\nand the fact that one can define\n\none obtains easily the following gauge transformation for the gauge potential A\u03bc\nAg\u03bc = g \u22c6 A\u03bc \u22c6 g \u2020 + ig \u22c6 \u2202\u03bc g \u2020 .\n\n(3.15)\n\nIt appears that another type of transformations given by\n\u03c6U = U \u22c6 \u03c6 \u22c6 U \u2020 \u2261 \u03b1(\u03c6)\n\n(3.16)\n\nfor any U \u2208 U(M) has been also considered in the literature. In physical words, this\ntransformation could be viewed as a noncommutative analog of the so called \"gauge\ntransformation in the adjoint representation\". It is instructive to confront the actual\n3\n\nkeeping in mind that M = H is considered as a hermitian module over itself\n\n7\n\n\fmathematical status of these transformations to the algebraic framework developed above.\nIn fact, (3.16) defines an automorphism \u03b1 of algebra, since one has obviously\n\u03b1(\u03c61 \u22c6 \u03c62 ) = \u03b1(\u03c61) \u22c6 \u03b1(\u03c62 )\n\n(3.17)\n\nHowever, this transformation does not correspond to an automorphism of module (which\nshould satisfy \u03b1(\u03c61 \u22c6 \u03c62 )=\u03b1(\u03c61) \u22c6 \u03c62 ) except when U is in the center of M which in the\npresent case is equal to C. Within the present framework, the transformations (3.16)\ncannot be viewed, strictly speaking, as gauge transformations which, by their very definition, must be related to morphisms of module. It would be temptating to introduce a\n\"covariant derivative\" whose form suggested by (3.16) is given by\nD\u03bc (\u03c6) = \u2202\u03bc \u03c6 \u2212 i[A\u03bc , \u03c6]\u22c6\n\n(3.18)\n\nCovariance under (3.16) (D\u03bc (\u03c6))U =U \u22c6 (D\u03bc (\u03c6)) \u22c6 U \u2020 is insured provided\nAU\u03bc = U \u22c6 A\u03bc \u22c6 U \u2020 + iU \u22c6 \u2202\u03bc U \u2020\n\n(3.19)\n\nIt is easy to realize that D\u03bc is a derivation of the Moyal algebra M since it satisfies a\nLeibnitz rule\nD\u03bc (\u03c61 \u22c6 \u03c62 ) = D\u03bc (\u03c61 ) \u22c6 \u03c62 + \u03c61 \u22c6 D\u03bc (\u03c62 )\n\n(3.20)\n\nwhich however does not coincides with (3.2) defining a noncommutative connection. However, the above noncommutative analog of \"gauge transformation in the adjoint representation\" can be understood in terms of actual noncommutative gauge transformations\nprovided the initial algebra M is enlarged to M by M \u2297 Mo , where Mo is the opposite\nalgebra as shown for instance in [4] which amounts to deal with real structure instead of\nhermitian structure. This will not be further considered in this talk.\n\n3.3\n\nCanonical gauge-invariant connection\n\nIn the present Moyal framework, it turns out that the following relation holds\n\u03be\u03bc \u2261 \u2212\u0398\u22121\n\u03bc\u03bd x\u03bd\n\n\u2202\u03bc \u03c6 = [i\u03be\u03bc , \u03c6]\u22c6 ,\n\n(3.21)\n\nsimply expressing the fact that the derivative \u2202\u03bc in M is an inner derivative. In fact, all\nderivatives in the Moyal algebra are inner derivatives.\nAs already pointed out during this conference [39], the existence of inner derivations\n(3.21) implies necessarily the existence of a \"canonical connection\" that remains invariant\nunder the gauge transformations. Canonical gauge-invariant connections are not new in\nnoncommutative geometry as already mentioned in earlier studies [32]. Here, the gaugeinvariant connection is defined by \u03be\u03bc . Indeed, the connection \u2207\u03be\u03bc verifies\n\u2207\u03be\u03bc \u03c6 = \u2202\u03bc \u03c6 \u2212 i\u03be\u03bc \u22c6 \u03c6 = \u2212i\u03c6 \u22c6 \u03be\u03bc\n\n(3.22)\n\nwhere the second equality stems simply from (3.21). Then, it is easy to realise that\n(\u2207\u03be\u03bc )g (\u03c6) = g \u22c6 (\u2207\u03be\u03bc (g \u2020 \u22c6 \u03c6)) = \u2212i\u03c6 \u22c6 \u03be\u03bc = \u2207\u03be\u03bc \u03c6\n8\n\n(3.23)\n\n\fwhich shows that \u2207\u03be\u03bc is invariant under the gauge transformations, leading to\n\u03be\u03bcg = \u03be\u03bc\n\n(3.24)\n\nThis could have been checked directly by combining the actual expression for \u03be\u03bc with\n(3.15) and (3.21).\nIn the present case, the existence of the gauge-invariant connection defined above\nsingles out a natural tensorial form defined as\n\u03be\n\u2207A\n\u03bc \u2212 \u2207\u03bc = \u2212i(A\u03bc \u2212 \u03be\u03bc ) \u2261 \u2212iA\u03bc\n\n(3.25)\n\nThis tensorial form coincides with the so called covariant coordinates (see e.g. [1]) that\nare sometimes introduced in the context of string theories.\nGiven a connection \u2207A\n\u03bc , the corresponding curvature is\nA\nA\nF\u03bc\u03bd\n\u2261 i[\u2207A\n\u03bc , \u2207\u03bd ]\u22c6 =\u2202\u03bc A\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd A\u03bc \u2212 i[A\u03bc , A\u03bd ]\u22c6\n\u03be\n=\u0398\u22121\n\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 i[A\u03bc , A\u03bd ]\u22c6 = F\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 i[A\u03bc , A\u03bd ]\u22c6\n\n(3.26)\n\nwhere the two rightmost equalities stem from (3.21) and (3.25). The gauge transformaA\ntions for A\u03bc and F\u03bc\u03bd\nare readily obtained and are given by\nAg\u03bc = g \u22c6 A\u03bc \u22c6 g \u2020 ,\n\nA g\nA\n(F\u03bc\u03bd\n) = g \u22c6 F\u03bc\u03bd\n\u22c6 g\u2020\n\n(3.27)\n\nNote that the invariant connection defined by \u03be\u03bc is a constant curvature connection since\none has\n\u03be\nF\u03bc\u03bd\n= \u0398\u22121\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\n3.4\n\n(3.28)\n\nThe minimal coupling prescription.\n\nIn the rest of this talk, I will assume that the action of the gauge group on the matter\nfields \u03c6 is given by (3.11). Owing to the special role played by the coordinate functions\nx\u03bc through the invariant gauge potential \u03be\u03bc involved in \u2207\u03be\u03bc and (3.21), a natural choice\nfor the minimal coupling prescription [7] is obtained by performing the usual substitution\n\u2202\u03bc \u2192 \u2207A\n\u03bc\n\n(3.29)\n\nin the considered action provided this latter is reexpressed in terms of \u2202\u03bc and \u2207\u03be\u03bc , using\nin particular the following identity:\nx\ne\u03bc \u03c6 = x\ne\u03bc \u22c6 \u03c6 \u2212 i\u2202\u03bc \u03c6 = \u2212i(\u2202\u03bc \u03c6 \u2212 2i\u03be\u03bc \u22c6 \u03c6) = \u22122i\u2207\u03be\u03bc \u03c6 + i\u2202\u03bc \u03c6.\n\n(3.30)\n\nUsing (3.30), the minimal coupling prescription can be conveniently written as\n\u2202\u03bc \u03c6 7\u2192 \u2207A\n\u03bc \u03c6 = \u2202\u03bc \u03c6 \u2212 iA\u03bc \u22c6 \u03c6,\n\n(3.31)\n\nx\ne\u03bc \u03c6 7\u2192 \u22122i\u2207\u03be\u03bc \u03c6 + i\u2207A\ne\u03bc \u03c6 + A\u03bc \u22c6 \u03c6.\n\u03bc\u03c6 = x\n\n(3.32)\n\ng\nA,\u03be\n(\u2207A,\u03be\n\u03bc (\u03c6)) = g \u22c6 (\u2207\u03bc (\u03c6))\n\n(3.33)\n\nNote that gauge invariance of the resulting action functional is obviously obtained thanks\nto the relation\n\nThis prescription will be used in a while to couple the relevant matter action with harmonic\nterm to an external gauge potential.\n9\n\n\f4\n\nRenormalisable actions for matter\n\n4.1\n\nThe harmonic solution\n\nUp to now, I have recalled the main features of the Moyal algebra M within the relevant\nalgebraic framework of noncommutative geometry. I have also assumed M plays the role\nof the module so that we work with a simple free module from which are defined the fields\nand connections to be further used in some actions. Let us briefly review some salient\nfeatures of the present situation about renormalisable actions for matter.\nAs far as I know, no firm guiding principle ruling the construction of actions on M\nhas been identified so far. In D=4, a rather natural noncommutative analog of the\ncommutative Yang-Mills action stemming from the Connes-Lott action functional [40],\nthe spectral action principle [41] is given by\nZ\nSY M = d4 xF\u03bc\u03bd \u22c6 F\u03bc\u03bd\n(4.1)\nwhere F\u03bc\u03bd is defined by (3.26). This however cannot be directly extended to the matter actions. Nevertheless, the expression (4.1) suggested in the old days the following\nsimple recipe: Naive noncommutative candidates for matter actions on M may be obtained by replacing all the ordinary local of their commutative counterparts by nonlocal\nprocedure preserves the locality of the kinetic term since one has\nR 4 \u22c6-products.\nRThis\n\u2020\n4\nd x\u2202\u03bc \u03c6 \u22c6 \u2202\u03bc \u03c6= d x\u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u2020 \u2202\u03bc \u03c6 thanks to (2.3). But it turns any commutative local polynomial interaction into a non local interaction, as a consequence of the definition of the\n\u22c6-product. For instance, one has\nZ\n\n1\nd x(\u03c6 \u22c6 \u03c6 \u22c6 \u03c6 \u22c6 \u03c6)(x) = 4 4\n\u03c0 \u03b8\n4\n\n\u2020\n\n\u2020\n\nZ Y\n4\n\nd4 xi \u03c6\u2020 (x1 )\u03c6(x2 )\u03c6\u2020 (x3 )\u03c6(x4 )\n\ni=1\n\n\u00d7\u03b4(x1 \u2212 x2 + x3 \u2212 x4 )e\u2212i\n\nP\n\ni+j+1 x \u2227x\ni\nj\ni<j (\u22121)\n\n.\n\nwhere x \u2227 y\u22612x\u03bc \u0398\u22121\n\u03bc\u03bd y\u03bd . The non locality of the interaction is responsible for the possible occurrencee of the UV/IR-mixing [13, 14], that makes the renormalisability very\nunlikely. It results from the existence of dangerous non-planar 4 diagrams which, albeit\nUV finite, become singular at exceptional (low) external momenta. This triggers the\nappearancee of UV divergences in higher order diagrams in which they are involved as\nsubdiagrams,signallingg that UV and IR scales are related in a non-trivial way which\nshould in principle invalidate a Wilson-type renormalisation scheme [15, 16]. Consider for\ninstance the action for the real-valued scalar \u03c64 theory in D=4:\nZ\n\u0001\n1\nm2\ng\nS0\u03c6 = d4 x \u2202\u03bc \u03c6 \u22c6 \u2202\u03bc \u03c6 +\n\u03c6\u22c6\u03c6+ \u03c6\u22c6\u03c6\u22c6\u03c6\u22c6\u03c6\n(4.2)\n2\n2\n4\n4\n\nThe terminology \"planar\" and \"non planar\" diagrams can be most easily understood within the\nmatrix base formalism where diagrams become ribbon diagrams. Planar (resp. non planar) diagrams can\n(resp. cannot) be drawn on a plan are called planar (resp. non planar).\n\n10\n\n\fThe one-loop tadpole part of the two-point\nR d4 k 1function involves two contributions. The\nplanar diagram contribution is Cp \u223cg (2\u03c0)\n4 k 2 +m2 and exhibits the expected UV divergence in four dimensions. However, the non planar contribution is\nZ\np\ng\nd4 k eik\u2227p\ngm p 2\nCnp =\n=\n(p\u0303)\nK\n(m\n(p\u0303)2 )\n(4.3)\n1\n12\n(2\u03c0)4 k 2 + m2\n48\u03c0 2\n\nwhere p\u0303\u2261\u0398\u03bc\u03bd p\u03bd , the exponential oscillating factor in the integrand comes simply from the\nnon locality of the vertex and K1 denotes the modified Bessel function of rank 1 (p is\nthe external momentum). Although this latter contribution is UV finite, it exhibits an\ninfrared singularity, since one has Cnp \u223c (p\u0303)1 2 for p \u2192 0 which holds thanks to K1 (x)\u223cx\u22121 for\nx\u21920. This implies that, if \u039b denotes some UV cut-off used to regularise the ultraviolet\nbehaviour of the integrals, the two limits \u039b\u2192\u221e and p\u21920 do not commute. This is,\nin essence, the UV/IR mixing phenomenon first exhibited in [13]. Moreover, such a\ntadpole triggers theappearancee of UV divergence in higher order diagrams in which it is\ninvolved as a subdiagram. This divergence is non local and therefore cannot be absorbed\ninto a mass redefinition so that the scalar model (4.2) is not a priori renormalisable. A\nsomehow similar conclusion applies to the naive noncommutative extension of the YangMills action (4.1) indicating clearly that some principle(s) should supplement or replace\nthe initial naive recipe. As far as I know, two possible solutions have been identified so\nfar, each having its own merits and drawbacks. In the rest of this talk, I will focus only on\nthe \"harmonic solution\" proposed by Grosse and Wulkenhaar [17]. The second possible\nsolution is related to the so called twisted noncommutative field theories (for more details\nsee e.g [42] and references therein).\nIn [17], Grosse and Wulkenhaar showed that the UV/IR-mixing of (4.2) can be suppressed by supplementing the initial action with a harmonic oscillator term leading to a\nrenormalisable noncommutative quantum field theory. This is the \"harmonic solution\".\nThe modified action is (e\nx\u03bc =2\u0398\u22121\n\u03bc\u03bd x\u03bd )\nZ\n\u0001\n\u03a92\nm2\ng\n1\n(e\nx\u03bc \u03c6) \u22c6 (e\nx\u03bc \u03c6) +\n\u03c6\u22c6\u03c6+ \u03c6\u22c6\u03c6\u22c6\u03c6\u22c6\u03c6\n(4.4)\nS\u03c6 = d4 x \u2202\u03bc \u03c6 \u22c6 \u2202\u03bc \u03c6 +\n2\n2\n2\n4\nwhere \u03a9\u2208[0, 1] for reasons given below. The actual interpretation of the harmonic term is\nso far not quite clear. The initial beautiful proof for the renormalisability of (4.4) has been\ncarried out within the matrix-base formalism. Basically, using the fields expansion in the\nmatrix-base, one maps (4.4) onto an infinite-dimensional complex-valued matrix model.\nThe technical key point is the computation of the propagator as the formal inverse of an\ninfinite dimensional matrix in terms of the Meixner polynomials. By further combining\nthe propagators to the renormalisation group machinery with sharp bounds put on the\nmatrix indices and using the Wilson-Polchinski equations, one can then prove [17] that\nthe modified action (4.4) is renormalisable to all orders. The introduction of the harmonic\nterm produces in some sense a kind of infrared cut-off in the theory and allows the UV and\nIR scales to decouple. It turns out that (4.4) is covariant under a duality transformation\n[29], sometimes called the \"Langman-Szabo\" duality (LS duality). Roughly speaking, this\nexpresses the fact that the form of (4.4) is, up to rescaling factors, not altered through\nx\ne\u03bc \u21c6\u2202\u03bc . The LS duality is defined5 by\np\n\u03c6(p)\nb \u21c6 \u03c0 2 |det\u0398|\u03c6(x), p\u03bc \u21c6 x\ne\u03bc\n(4.5)\n5\n\nR\ni\nX\u0302 is the cyclic Fourier transform of X given by fb(pi )= d4 xei(\u22121) pi *xi f (xi ); the coordinates appear-\n\n11\n\n\fwhich applied on the action yields\nm g 1\n, , )\n(4.6)\n\u03a9 \u03a92 \u03a9\nso that \u03a9 can be consistently restricted to \u03a9\u2208[0, 1]. Note that (4.4) is invariant for \u03a9=1.\nSo far, the requirement of LS duality has been helpfull to construct other renormalisable\nactions for complex-valued scalar fields. However, more investigations are needed to\nclarify the actual role of the L-S duality [29] in the control of the UV/IR-mixing and\nrenormalisability. While it is obvious that the implementation of LS-duality can be easily\nachieved within matter actions with polynomial interaction terms, the situation changes\ndrastically for Yang-Mills type theories as it will be shown in the next section. Let us\nnow recall the main features of most of the presently known renormalisable field theories\ndefined on Moyal spaces. Note that interesting solvable noncommutative scalar field\ntheories have been considered in [23, 24, 25] to which I refer for more details.\nS\u03c6 (\u03c6; m, g, \u03a9) \u21c6 \u03a92 S\u03c6 (\u03c6;\n\n4.2\n\nThe 4-dimensional \"harmonic\" complex scalar model\n\nThe corresponding classical action , covariant under the LS-duality, is\nZ\n\u0001\nS(\u03c6) = d4 x \u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u2020 \u22c6 \u2202\u03bc \u03c6 + \u03a92 (e\nx\u03bc \u03c6)\u2020 \u22c6 (e\nx\u03bc \u03c6) + m2 \u03c6\u2020 \u22c6 \u03c6 (x) + Sint ,\n\n(4.7)\n\n\u03c6 is a complex scalar field with mass m, the parameters \u03a9 and \u03bb are dimensionless and\nthe term involving \u03a9 is the (complex-valued) scalar counterpart of the harmonic oscillator\nterm. The interaction term Sint is\nZ\n0\nNO\nSint = Sint + Sint = \u03bb(\u03c6\u2020 \u22c6 \u03c6 \u22c6 \u03c6\u2020 \u22c6 \u03c6)(x) + \u03ba(\u03c6\u2020 \u22c6 \u03c6\u2020 \u22c6 \u03c6 \u22c6 \u03c6)(x).\n(4.8)\nO\nIt turns out that (4.7) restricted to Sint\n(\u03ba=0) is renormalisable for any value of \u03a9 [19]\nNO\n(see also [27]). The effect of the inclusion of Sint\non the renormalisability is not known.\nHowever in that latter case, it can be shown [43] that a term \u223c \u03ba\u03c6\u2020 x\ne\u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u03c6 is induced at\nthe one-loop order whose coefficient is such that it \"completes the square in the quadratic\npart\": the quadratic part of the action can then be cast into the form:\u223c|\u2202\u03bc \u03c6+ i\u03b1e\nx\u03bc \u03c6|2\nwhere \u03b1 is some constant. This can be explicitely verified by a direct computation in the\nx-space, using the Mehler expression for the propagator C(x, y) \u2261 h\u03c6(x)\u03c6\u2020 (y)i obtained\ne 2 x2 + m2 )C(x, y) = \u03b4(x \u2212 y) which gives (\u03a9\ne \u2261 2\u03a9)\nby solving (\u2206x + \u03a9\n\u03b8\nZ\n\u0010 \u03a9\n\u0011\n\u221e\ne\ne\n\u03a92\n\u03a9\ndt\n2\n2\n2\ne\ne\nexp\n\u2212\nC(x, y) = 2 2\ncoth(\n\u03a9t)(x\u2212y)\n\u2212\ntanh(\n\u03a9t)(x+y)\n\u2212\nm\nt\n,\ne\n\u03c0 \u03b8 0 sinh2 (2\u03a9t)\n4\n4\n(4.9)\n\n4.3\n\nThe LSZ-type models\n\nThe corresponding action is given by\nZ\n\u0001\nSLSZ (\u03c6) = d4 x (\u2202\u03bc \u03c6 + i\u03a9e\nx\u03bc \u03c6)\u2020 \u22c6 (\u2202\u03bc \u03c6 + i\u03a9e\nx\u03bc \u03c6) + m2 \u03c6\u2020 \u22c6 \u03c6 (x) + Sint\n\n(4.10)\n\ning in cyclic order in the quartic interaction are labelled as xi , i=1, 2, 3, 4 and similarly for the momenta\npi\n\n12\n\n\fwhere Sint has been given above. For the initial formulation of the LSZ model, see [21].\nThe LSZ model has been shown to be renormalisable to all orders whenever \u03ba=0. The\nproof, as sketched in [19], is somehow similar to the one given in [27] for the noncommutative Gross-Neveu model. At the present time, the actual impact of interaction terms as\nNO\ngiven by Sint\non the renormalisability of the above models is not known. However, it is\nO\nNO\nlikely that the LSZ model involving both Sint\nand Sint\nis renormalisable to all order.\nAt this level, it is instructive to interpret the action (4.10) in the light of the algebraic\nframework that has been developed. In fact, the operator \u2202\u03bc + i\u03a9e\nx\u03bc is actually related to\n\u03b6\na connection \u2207\u03bc with\n\u03b6\u03bc =\n\n2\u03a9\n\u03be\u03bc ,\n1+\u03a9\n\n(4.11)\n\nsince the following relation\n\u0011\n\u0010\n2\u03a9\n\u03be\u03bc \u22c6 \u03c6 = (1 + \u03a9)\u2207\u03b6\u03bc (\u03c6)\n(\u2202\u03bc + i\u03a9e\nx\u03bc )\u03c6 = (1 + \u03a9) \u2202\u03bc \u03c6 \u2212 i\n1+\u03a9\n\nholds in view of (3.13). The action (4.10) can then be rewritten as\nZ\n\u0001\nSLSZ (\u03c6) = d4 x (1 + \u03a9)2 (\u2207\u03b6\u03bc (\u03c6))\u2020 \u22c6 \u2207\u03b6\u03bc (\u03c6) + m2 \u03c6\u2020 \u22c6 \u03c6 (x) + Sint ,\n\n(4.12)\n\n(4.13)\n\nwhere \u03b6 is given by (4.11) which, for \u03a9 6= 0, makes explicit the invariance of the action\nunder the gauge transformations \u03c6g = g \u22c6 \u03c6 for any g \u2208 U(M). Notice that a similar\ncomment applies to the noncommutative version of the (two-dimensional) Gross-Neveu\nmodel considered recently in [27], [28] to which we turn now on.\n\n4.4\n\nThe 2-D orientable Gross-Neveu model\n\nThe Moyal algebra can be trivially adapted to the two-dimensional case. The action for\nthe non-commutative Gross-Neveu model first considered in [27] can be written as\nSGN =\nwith\n\nZ\n\n3\nX\n\u0002\n\u0003\ngA A\n/\n/\nd x \u03c8\u0304(\u2212i\u2202 + \u03a9x\ne + m + \u03ba\u03b35 )\u03c8 \u2212\n(J \u22c6 J A )(x)\n4\nA=1\n2\n\nJ A =\u03c8\u0304 \u22c6 \u0393A \u03c8, \u03931 = I, \u03932 = \u03b3 \u03bc , \u03933 = \u03b35\n\n(4.14)\n\n(4.15)\n\nwhere a\nover the Lorentz indices \u03bc is understood in the inter/ = a\u03bc \u03b3 \u03bc and a summation P\naction term involving J2 , J2 \u22c6 J2 = \u03bc (\u03c8\u0304 \u22c6 \u03b3\u03bc \u03c8) \u22c6 (\u03c8\u0304 \u22c6 \u03b3 \u03bc \u03c8). The Clifford algebra for the\n2D anti-Hermitian gamma matrices satisfy {\u03b3 \u03bc , \u03b3 \u03bd } = \u22122\u03b4 \u03bc\u03bd and \u03b35 = \u0131\u03b3 0 \u03b3 1 . Here, the\nfield \u03c8 denotes a 2N-component spinor field where N is the number of colors. In (4.14),\n/ \u03c8is the Fermionic counterpart of the harmonic oscillator term. The minus\nthe term \u03a9\u03c8\u0304 x\ne\nsign affecting the four-Fermion interaction term in (4.14) is a meregeneralisationn of the\ninteraction term in the commutative Gross Neveu model for which asymptotic freedom\nis obtained. Six independent four-fermion interactions can in principle\nbe constructed.\nP\nThe three interaction terms in which \u03c8 and \u03c8\u0304 alternate, namely a,b \u03c8\u0304a \u22c6 \u03c8b \u22c6 \u03c8\u0304a \u22c6 \u03c8b ,\n13\n\n\fP\n\nP\n\u03c8\u0304a \u22c6 \u03c8b \u22c6 \u03c8\u0304b \u22c6 \u03c8a , a,b \u03c8\u0304a \u22c6 \u03c8a \u22c6 \u03c8\u0304b \u22c6 \u03c8b (the sum runs over color indices a, b), gives rise\nafter suitable Fierz transformations to the interaction term in (4.14). This action has been\nshown to be renormalisable to all orders in [27]. Three\nP other interaction\nP terms with adjacent \u03c8 and \u03c8\u0304 could in principle be written, namely a,b \u03c8\u0304a \u22c6 \u03c8\u0304b \u22c6\u03c8a \u22c6\u03c8b , a,b \u03c8\u0304a \u22c6 \u03c8\u0304b \u22c6\u03c8b \u22c6\u03c8a ,\nP\na,b \u03c8\u0304a \u22c6 \u03c8\u0304a \u22c6 \u03c8b \u22c6 \u03c8b . Although not explicitely proven at the present time, it seems likely\nthat the Gross-Neveu model involving both type of interactions is renormalisable.\nIt can be easily realised that SGN can be cast into the form\nZ\n\u0001\nSGN = d2 x \u2212 i(1 + \u03a9)\u03c8\u0304\u03b3 \u03bc \u2207\u03b6\u03bc \u03c8 + m\u03c8\u0304\u03c8 (x) + ...,\n(4.16)\na,b\n\nwhere the ellipses denote interaction terms. Recall that the same covariant derivative\nalready appeared in the LSZ-type models. In physical words, these two latter actions\ncan be interpreted as matter actions already coupled to an external (background) gauge\npotential \u03b6\u03bc (while the action (4.7) does not obviously support this interpretation).\n\n5\n\nThe one-loop effective gauge action.\n\nLet us start from the action S(\u03c6, A) obtained byminimallyy coupling (4.7) to an external\ngauge potential through the minimal coupling prescription introduced above. Indeed,\ncombining (3.31), (3.32) with (4.7), one easily obtains the gauge-invariant action [7]\nZ\nS(\u03c6, A) =S(\u03c6) + d4 x (1 + \u03a92 )\u03c6\u2020 \u22c6 (e\nx\u03bc A\u03bc ) \u22c6 \u03c6\n\u0001\n\u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03a92 )\u03c6\u2020 \u22c6 A\u03bc \u22c6 \u03c6 \u22c6 x\ne\u03bc + (1 + \u03a92 )\u03c6\u2020 \u22c6 A\u03bc \u22c6 A\u03bc \u22c6 \u03c6 (x),\n(5.1)\n\nO\nwhere S(\u03c6) is given by (4.7) with Sint restricted to its gauge-invariant part Sint\n, see (4.8).\nWe are now in position to compute the effective action \u0393(A) obtained by integrating\nover the scalar field \u03c6 in S(\u03c6, A), for any value of \u03a9 \u2208 [0, 1]. The computation can be\nconveniently carried out within the x-space formalism [19]. For a similar computation\nperformed in the matrix-base, see [8]. There are several motivations to perform such a\ncalculation. In particular, it can be expected that the expression of \u0393(A) should be a\nhepfull tool to guess possible form(s) for a candidate as a renormalisable gauge action.\nThis would permits one to determine whether or not some additional terms beyond the\nexpected F\u03bc\u03bd \u22c6 F\u03bc\u03bd appear in the effective action, in what extend the initial harmonic\nterm in (5.1) survive in \u0393(A) action and whether or not some relic of the LangmannSzabo shows up in the effective action.\nRecall that the effective action is formally obtained from\nZ\nZ\n\u2212\u0393(A)\n\u2020 \u2212S(\u03c6,A)\ne\n\u2261 D\u03c6D\u03c6 e\n= D\u03c6D\u03c6\u2020e\u2212S(\u03c6) e\u2212Sint (\u03c6,A) ,\n(5.2)\n\nwhere S(\u03c6) is given by (4.7) and Sint (\u03c6, A) can be read off from (5.1) and (4.7).

The corresponding diagrams are\ndepicted on the figures 3-6. These diagrams can be computed from the propagator and\ninteraction vertices derived from (4.7). The scalar propagator C(x, y) \u2261 h\u03c6(x)\u03c6\u2020 (y)i has\nbeen already given in (4.9).

The nonlocality of the interaction is conveniently represented by the rhombus appearing on fig. 1\nwhose vertices correspond to the xi 's occurring in (5.4). It is useful to represent the\nalternate signs in the delta function of (5.4) by plus- and minus-signs, as depicted on the\nfigure. By convention, a plus-sign (resp. minus-sign) corresponds to an incoming field\n\u03c6\u2020 (resp. outgoing field \u03c6). This permits one to define an orientation on the diagrams\nobtained from the loop expansion.\n\nFigure 1: Graphical representation for the vertex in the x-space, obtained from (5.4).

Within this latter algebraic framework, the commutative algebras of\nfunctions on differentiable manifolds are replaced by associative algebras that plays the\nrole of \"noncommutative spaces\". One example, among many others, is provided by the\nassociative Moyal algebras that have been considered in the mathematical literature a\nlong time ago from various viewpoints (see e.g. [12], [10, 11] and references therein). In\nnoncommutative geometry, the relevant configuration spaces for field theories are modules\nover these associative algebras, interpreted as noncommutative analogues for the set of\nsections of vector bundles, while the linear spaces of the derivations of these algebras can\nbe viewed as the noncommutative counterparts of the spaces of vector fields of commutative spaces. This permits one to define natural noncommutative extensions of connections\nand curvatures [3, 4]. The particular situation considered in this talk corresponds to the\nfree module case, the most widely studied case in the literature, where the algebra M is\nviewed as a hermitian module over itself. Then, the noncommutative analogue of gauge\ntransformations are associated with the automorphisms of hermitian modules. The fact\nthat M has only inner derivations implies the existence of a canonical gauge-invariant\nconnection [32, 33] from which a natural tensorial form can be defined. It is by the way\nrelated to the so-called covariant coordinates [1].\nWhile several renormalisable noncommutative matter field theories have now been\nclearly identified, thanks to the \"harmonic solution\" proposed initially in [17], the construction of renormalisable actions for gauge theories defined on noncommutative Moyal\nspaces remains so far a challenging problem. One important step toward its solution is to\nguess possible form(s) for a candidate as a renormalisable gauge action and in particular\na possible expression for the gauge counterpart (if it exists at all) of the harmonic term\nof [17]. This is what we actually obtained in [7].\nIt is known from general arguments of quantum field theory that a valuable information\nabout the possible form for gauge actions can be extracted from those effective gauge\n20\n\n\factions obtained by integrating over the matter degrees of freedom of a matter action\ncoupled in a gauge invariant way to an external gauge potential. So, we started from, says\nS(\u03c6, A), a renormalisable complex-valued scalar field theory with harmonic term [17, 19],\nminimally coupled to an external gauge potential. We computed at the one-loop order\nthe effective gauge theory action \u0393(A) [7] given in (5.15), obtained by integrating over the\nscalar field \u03c6, for any value of the harmonic parameter \u03a9 \u2208 [0, 1] in S(\u03c6, A). Independently\nof our analysis, H. Grosse and M. Wohlgennant have recently carried out a nice calculation\nwithin the matrix-base [8] of the one-loop effective gauge action obtained from a scalar\ntheory with harmonic term different from ours, extending a previous work [46] dealing\nwith the limiting case \u03a9 = 1. The scalar theory considered in [8] is somehow similar to\nthe one that one would obtain by considering \"covariant derivative\" as given in (3.18)\nwith symmetry transformations as those given by (3.16). It can be easily verified that\nour effective action agrees globally with the one given in [8], up to unessential numerical\nfactors. For more details, see M. Wohlgennant's talk at this conference.\nWe find that the effective\nR 4gauge theory action involves, beyond the usual expected\nYang-Mills contribution\nterms of quadratic and quartic orR 4\u223c d x F\u03bc\u03bd \u22c6 F\u03bc\u03bd , Radditional\n4\nder in A\u03bc (3.25), \u223c d x A\u03bc \u22c6 A\u03bc and \u223c d x {A\u03bc , A\u03bd }2\u22c6 . These additional terms are\ngauge invariant thanks to the fact that, as a tensorial form, A\u03bc transforms covariantly\nunder gauge transformations. The quadratic term involves a mass term for the gauge\npotential A\u03bc . Recall that such a bare mass term for a gauge potential would be forbidden\nby gauge invariance in commutative Yang-Mills theories. At this point, one important\ncomment relative to (5.15) is in order. The fact that the tadpole is non-vanishing (see\n(5.11)) is a rather unusual feature for a Yang-Mills type theory.\nR 4 This non-vanishing implies automatically\nthe occurrence of the mass-type term d x A\u03bc \u22c6 A\u03bc as well as the\nR\nquartic term d4 x {A\u03bc , A\u03bd }2\u22c6 .\nIt is tempting to conjecture that the following class of actions (\u03b1, \u03a9\u2032 , \u03ba and g are\nparameters)\nZ\n\u0011\n\u0010 \u03b1\n\u03a9\u2032\n\u03ba\n2\nF\n\u22c6\nF\n+\n{A\n,\nA\n}\n+\nA\n\u22c6\nA\n(6.1)\nS = d4 x\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bc\n\u03bd\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u22c6\n4g 2\n4g 2\n2\ninvolves suitable candidates for renormalisable actions for gauge theory defined\nR on Moyal\nspaces. The naive action for a Yang-Mills theory on the Moyal space, \u223c d4 x F\u03bc\u03bd \u22c6\nF\u03bc\u03bd , taken alone, has UV/IR mixing [30, 31]. In (6.1), the second term built from the\nanticommutator may be viewed as a \"gauge counterpart\" of the harmonic term. According\nto the above discussion, the presence of the quadratic and quartic terms in A\u03bc in (6.1)\nwill be reflected in a non-vanishing vacuum expectation value for A\u03bc . The consequences\nof a possible occurrence of this non-trivial vacuum remain to be understood in view of a\nsubsequent BRST gauge-fixing of a gauge action derived from (6.1). .\n\nAcknowledgements: I would like to thank the organiserss of the \"International Conference on Noncommutative Geometry and Physics\" for their kind invitation.
