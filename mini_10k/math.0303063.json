It has been recently observed that analogous methods in quantum\nstatistical mechanics require the study of random walks on oriented lattices, due to the intrinsic\nnon commutative character of the (quantum) world (see e.g. [5, 13]). Although random\nwalks in random and non-random environments have been intensively studied for many years,\nonly a few results on random walks on oriented lattices are known. The recurrence versus\ntransience properties of simple random walks on oriented versions of Z2 are studied in [4]\nwhen the horizontal lines are unidirectional towards a random or deterministic direction. The\ninteresting behavior of this model is that, depending on the orientation, the walk could be\neither recurrent or transient. In the deterministic \"alternate\" case, for which the orientations\nof horizontal lines are alternated, i.e. oriented rightwards at one level and leftwards at the\nfollowing level, the recurrence of the simple random walk is proved, whereas the transience\nnaturally arises when the orientations are all identical in infinite regions. More surprisingly,\nit is also proved that the recurrent character of the simple random walk on Z2 is lost when\nthe orientations are i.i.d. with zero mean.\nIn this paper, we prove that the transience of the simple random walk still holds when\nthe orientations are symmetric and positively correlated with a summable power law decay of\ncorrelations. We also prove a functional limit theorem for this walk with an unconventional\nnormalization due to the random character of the environment of the walk, solving an open\nquestion of [4]. Our paper is organized as follows: the description of our model and the\nresults are stated in Section 2. Section 3 is devoted to the proofs while illustrative examples\nof orientations, coming from statistical mechanics, are given in Section 4.\n\n2\n\nModel and results\n\n2.1\n\nFKG-horizontally oriented lattices\n\nWe consider a canonical probability space (\u03a9, B, P) on which all the random variables are\ndefined, and denote E (resp. Cov) the expectation (resp. covariance) under P. By orientations,\nwe mean a stationary symmetric family of {\u22121, +1}-valued random variables (\u01eby )y\u2208Z , with\nthe following properties:\n1. Associated random variables:\nFor any m \u2265 0, for any finite collection (\u01eb0 , . . . , \u01ebm ), for any coordinatewise nondecreasing functions f, g on {\u22121, +1}m ,\n\u0002\n\u0003\nCov f (\u01eb0 , . . . , \u01ebm ); g(\u01eb0 , . . . , \u01ebm ) \u2265 0.\n2. Summable power-law decay of correlations:\nThere exists \u03b1 > 1 such that\n\u0002\n\u0001\nE \u01eb0 \u01eby ] = O | y |\u2212\u03b1 when | y |\u2212\u2192 +\u221e.\n\nIn our set-up, these orientations are natural extensions of Rademacher random variables of\n[4]. They have the same one-dimensional law (P[\u01eb0 = +1] = P[\u01eb0 = \u22121] = 12 ) but are not\n2\n\n\fnecessarily independent. The notion of associated random variables (see [15]) is very natural\nin the context of Gibbs measures in statistical mechanics where it is equivalent to the FKG\nproperty of the joint distribution \u03bd of the random field \u01eb = (\u01eby )y\u2208Z ([10]). In such cases, we\nalso say that the orientations are positively correlated. Examples of such distributions are\nferromagnetic, possibly long range, Ising models, described in Section 4 at the end of this\npaper.\nWe use these associated random variables to build our FKG-horizontally oriented lattices.\nThese lattices are oriented versions of Z2 : the vertical lines are not oriented and the horizontal\nones are unidirectional, the orientation at a level y \u2208 Z being given by the random variable\n\u01eby (say right if the value is +1 and left if it is \u22121). More formally we give the\nDefinition 2.1 (FKG-horizontally oriented lattices) Let \u01eb = (\u01eby )y\u2208Z be a sequence of\n{\u22121, +1}-valued, associated and symmetric random variables. The FKG-horizontally oriented\nlattice L\u01eb = (V, A\u01eb ) is the directed graph with vertex set V = Z2 and edge set A\u01eb defined by\nthe condition that for u = (u1 , u2 ), v = (v1 , v2 ) \u2208 Z2 , (u, v) \u2208 A\u01eb if and only if\n1. either v1 = u1 and v2 = u2 \u00b1 1\n2. or v2 = u2 and v1 = u1 + \u01ebu2 .\n\n2.2\n\nSimple random walk on L\u01eb\n\nWe consider the usual simple random walk M = (Mn )n\u2208N on L\u01eb . It is a Markov chain with\ntransition probabilities defined for all (u, v) \u2208 A\u01eb by\n\uf8f1 1\n\uf8f2 3 if (u, v) \u2208 A\u01eb\nP[Mn+1 = v|Mn = u] =\n\uf8f3\n0 otherwise.\n\nIts transience is proved in [4] for almost every orientation when the directions are given by\na sequence of i.i.d. random variables (\u01eby )y\u2208Z , i.e. when the law \u03bd of the random field \u01eb is\na product probability measure. We generalize this result in this positively correlated and\npossibly non-independent context.\nTheorem 2.2 For \u03bd-a.e. realization of the orientation \u01eb, the simple random walk on the\nFKG-horizontally oriented lattice L\u01eb is transient.\nWe also answer in this general set-up to an open question of [4] and obtain a functional\nlimit theorem with a suitable and unconventional normalization. We consider a Brownian\nmotion (Wt )t\u22650 and denote (Lt (x))t\u22650 its corresponding local time at x \u2208 R. Moreover, we\nintroduce a pair of independent Brownian motions Z+ (x), Z\u2212 (x), x \u2265 0. We assume these\nprocesses to be defined on one probability space and to be independent of each other so that\nthe following process is well-defined for all t \u2265 0:\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\nLt (\u2212x)dZ\u2212 (x).\n(2.3)\nLt (x)dZ+ (x) +\n\u2206t =\n0\n\n0\n\nThis process is a particular example from a family of processes obtained in [12] as functional\nlimits of Z-valued random walks in random sceneries. Moreover, it has a continuous version\nwhich is self-similar with index 43 and has stationary increments. We also introduce a real\nconstant m = 21 , defined later as the mean of some geometric random variables related to the\nbehavior of the walk in the horizontal direction.\n3\n\n\fTheorem 2.4 The following convergence holds:\n\u0010 1\n\u0011\nm\nD\nM\n=\u21d2\n(\u2206t , 0)t\u22650\n[nt]\n3/4\nt\u22650\nn\n(1 + m)3/4\n\n(2.5)\n\nD\n\nwhere =\u21d2 stands for convergence in the space of c\u00e0dl\u00e0g functions D([0, \u221e), R2 ) endowed with\nthe Skorohod topology.\n\n3\n\nProofs\n\n3.1\n\nVertical and horizontal embeddings of the simple random walk\n\nThe simple random walk M defined on (\u03a9, B, P) can be decomposed into a vertical and an\nhorizontal part by restriction to the corresponding axis. The vertical part is a simple random\nwalk Y = (Yn )n\u2208N on the line. The (independent) \u03c3-algebras generated by this vertical walk\nY and the orientation \u01eb are denoted respectively by\nF = \u03c3(Yn , n \u2208 N) and G = \u03c3(\u01eby , y \u2208 Z).\nWe also define for all n \u2208 N and y \u2208 Z the local time at level y of the walk Y to be\n\u03b7n (y) =\n\nn\nX\n\n1Yk =y .\n\nk=0\n\nThe horizontal embedding is a random walk with N-valued geometric jumps. More formally, a\n(y)\ndoubly infinite family (\u03bei )i\u2208N\u2217 ,y\u2208Z of independent geometric random variables of parameter\np = 13 (and mean m = 21 ) is given and one defines the embedded horizontal random walk\nX = (Xn )n\u2208N by X0 = 0 and for n \u2265 1,\n\u03b7n\u22121 (y)\n\nXn =\n\nX\n\n\u01eby\n\nX\n\n(y)\n\n\u03bei\n\ni=1\n\ny\u2208Z\n\nwith the convention that the last sum is zero when \u03b7n\u22121 (y) = 0. Of course, the walk Mn does\nnot coincide with (Xn , Yn ) but these objects are closely related: define for all n \u2208 N\nTn = n +\n\nX(y)\nX \u03b7n\u22121\ny\u2208Z\n\n(y)\n\n\u03bei\n\ni=1\n\nto be the instant just after the random walk M has performed its nth vertical move. The\nfollowing Lemma is proved in [4].\nLemma 3.6\n\n1. MTn = (Xn , Yn ).\n\n2. For a given orientation \u01eb, the transience of (MTn )n\u2208N implies the transience of (Mn )n\u2208N .\n\n4\n\n\f3.2\n\nAssociated random variables\n\nThe extension from the i.i.d. case to our case is made possible by a comparison of the joint\ncharacteristic function of associated random variables with the product of the marginal ones,\ndue to Newman et al. ([15]).\nLemma 3.7 Let \u01eb = (\u01eby )y\u2208Z be a sequence of associated random variables. Then, for all\nt \u2208 R, n \u2208 N,\nh P\ni Y h\ni\n\u0003\n\u0002\n1 X\nE eit y\u2208Z \u01eby \u03b7n (y) F \u2212\nE eit\u01eby \u03b7n (y) F \u2264 t2\n\u03b7n (x)\u03b7n (y)E \u01ebx \u01eby .\n2\ny\u2208Z\n\n(3.8)\n\nx6=y\n\nProof. It is based on Theorem 1 in [15], which states that for a finite family of p associated\nr.v.'s (Z1 , . . . , Zp ) and real numbers (r1 , . . . , rp ),\n\u0002\n\ni\n\nE e\n\nPp\n\nk=1 rk Zk\n\n\u0003\n\np\nY\n\u0002\n\u0003\n1\nE eirk Zk \u2264\n\u2212\n2\nk=1\n\nX\n\n1\u2264j6=k\u2264p\n\n|rj ||rk |Cov(Zj , Zk ).\n\n(3.9)\n\nThe sum and product of the l.h.s of (3.8) have a finite number of terms because \u03b7n (y) = 0 for\n|y| > n. It is thus straightforward to derive (3.8) from (3.9) using the F-measurability of the\nlocal times \u03b7n (y), the associativity of \u01eb and its independence with the vertical walk Y .\n\n3.3\n\nProof of the transience of the simple random walk\n\nThe vertical walk Y is known to be recurrent and its asymptotic behavior is rather well\ncontrolled.

Natural examples of\nnon-product measures are given by Gibbs measures in statistical mechanics ([11]). To destroy\nthe independence of the random variables \u01eby , a family of measurable functions \u03a6 = (\u03a6A )A\u2208S\nindexed by the set S of finite subsets of Z, called potential, is introduced. For all \u01eb, \u03a6A (\u01eb)\nrepresents the interaction between the random variables (\u01eby )y\u2208A . A translation-invariant\nmeasure \u03bd \u03b2 on {\u22121, +1} is a Gibbs measure at inverse temperature \u03b2 > 0 for the interaction\n\u03a6 when it is an equilibrium state regard to some variational properties in terms of thermodynamic functions. An equivalent definition characterizes Gibbs measures in terms of continuity\nof their conditional probabilities w.r.t. the outside of finite sets, or via the well-known DLR\nequation. In some domains of temperature, there could be more than one Gibbs measure for\nan interaction \u03a6, and we then say that a phase transition holds. In this Gibbsian context,\nFKG property requires ferromagnetic pair interactions ([10]), i.e. a potential \u03a6 such that\n\u03a6A = 0 if card(A) > 2 and \u03a6{i,j} (\u01eb) = J(i, j)\u01ebi \u01ebj with J(i, j) \u2265 0 for all i, j \u2208 Z. This\nprovides us a wide family of examples suitable to our set-up.\n1. Ferromagnetic nearest neighbors Ising model:\nThe coupling is translation-invariant, positive for nearest neighbors pairs {i, j} \u2282 Z and\nnull otherwise:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 J \u2265 0 if |i \u2212 j| = 1\nJ(i, j) =\n\uf8f3\n0\notherwise.\nIt is well known ([11]) that this one-dimensional model does not exhibit a phase transition. By translation invariance of the potential, the unique Gibbs measure is then\ntranslation invariant, and equivalently the family \u01eb is stationary. Moreover, the decay of\ncorrelations of the random field \u01eb of law \u03bd is known to be exponential ([6, 7]). The absence of phase transition and the translation invariance property of the potential prove\nalso that the orientations are symmetric and thus fit in our framework.\n\n2. Long range ferromagnetic Ising model:\nIt is similarly defined but the coupling J(i, j) is non null for any pair {i, j} and has a\npower law decay: there exists \u03b1 > 1 and J \u2265 0 such that\nJ(i, j) = J.|i \u2212 j|\u2212\u03b1 .\nDepending on the value of \u03b1, there could be a phase transition in some domains of\ntemperature, and in particular two different regimes with summable power law decay of\ncorrelations are relevant in our set-up (see [1, 8, 14, 17]).\n(a) \u03b1 > 2.\nThere is no phase transition and the Gibbs measure for this potential is translation invariant. The variables are thus symmetric and one could also learn in the\nliterature that \u03b1 also governs a power law decay of correlations:\n\u0002\n\u0001\nE \u01eb0 \u01eby ] = O | y |\u2212\u03b1 when | y |\u2212\u2192 +\u221e.\n14\n\n\f(b) \u03b1 \u2208 ]1, 2[.\nThere exists a critical inverse temperature \u03b2c > 0 which separates the domain of\ntemperature in two different regimes. In the high temperature regime, there is no\nphase transition and the picture is as above: the power law decay is the same as\nthis of the interaction, i.e. governed by \u03b1. By translation-invariance of the unique\nphase, this provides us examples with very slow but summable power law decay of\ncorrelations for which our theorems hold.\nThe later is not necessarily true at low (or critical) temperature. Firstly, when\na phase transition holds, the random variables are not necessarily centered and\nsecondly, the power law decay of correlations is governed by \u03b1 \u2212 1 < 1, and thus\nthe correlations are not summable.\n\n5\n\nComments\n\nWe have extended the results of [4] to positively correlated orientations and solved one of their\nopen problems. In particular, we have proved that the simple random walk is still transient\nfor ferromagnetic models in absence of phase transition. As the walk can be recurrent for\ndeterministic orientations, it would be interesting to perturb deterministic cases in order to\nget a full picture of the transience versus recurrence properties and identify a sort of phase\ntransition. As a perturbation of the alternate lattice on which the walk is recurrent, we\nare studying anti-ferromagnetic systems (i.e. the case of a coupling J \u2264 0) for which the\nrecurrence might be conserved at low temperature. Similarly, one could consider negatively\ncorrelated orientations but this requires finer results on such distributions and a complete\ntheory of negative dependence has not been established yet (see e.g. [16, 3]).\nThe ingredients used to prove the functional limit theorems still hold for any m > 0 and\nTheorem 2.4 should therefore also be satisfied for more general random walks than the simple\nrandom walk on the lattice L\u01eb . This question is currently under considerations.\nAcknowledgments: We thank D. P\u00e9tritis for having introduced us to this subject and\nindicated to us the proof of Lemma 3.22.
