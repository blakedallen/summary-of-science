Bertulania\u2217\na\n\nDepartment of Physics and Astronomy, Texas A&M University, Commerce, TX 75429,\nUSA\n\nNuclear reactions in stars are difficult to measure directly in the laboratory at the\nsmall astrophysical energies. In recent years indirect methods with rare isotopes have\nbeen developed and applied to extract low-energy astrophysical cross sections [ 1].\nA. Elastic scattering and (p, p\u2032 ) reactions\nElastic proton scattering has been one of the major sources of information on the\nmatter distribution of unstable nuclei in radioactive beam facilities. The extended matter\ndistribution of light-halo nuclei (8 He, 11 Li, 11 Be, etc.) was clearly identified in elastic\nscattering experiments [ 2, 3]. Information on the matter distribution of many nuclei\nimportant for the nucleosynthesis in inhomogeneous Big Bang and in r-process scenarios\ncould also be obtained. In (p, p') scattering one obtains information on the excited states\nof the nuclei [ 4].\nB. Transfer reactions\nTransfer reactions A(a, b)B are effective when a momentum matching exists between\nthe transferred particle and the internal particles in the nucleus. Thus, beam energies\nshould be in the range of a few 10-100 MeV per nucleon [ 5]. Low energy reactions of\nastrophysical interest can be extracted directly from breakup reactions A+a \u2212\u2192 b+c+B\nby means of the Trojan Horse technique [ 6]. If the Fermi momentum of the particle x\ninside a = (b+x) compensates for the initial projectile velocity va , the low energy reaction\nA + x = B + c is induced at very low (even vanishing) relative energy between A and x.\nVery successful results using this technique have been reported [ 7].\nThe Asymptotic Normalization Coefficient (ANC) technique relies on fact that the\namplitude for the radiative\nD\nE capture cross section b + x \u2212\u2192 a + \u03b3 is given by M =\n(+)\na\na\nIbx (rbx )|O(rbx )|\u03c8i (rbx ) , where Ibx\n= h\u03c6a (\u03beb, \u03bex , rbx )|\u03c6x (\u03bex )\u03c6b (\u03beb )i is the integration over the internal coordinates \u03beb , and \u03bex , of b and x, respectively. For low ena\nergies, the overlap integral Ibx\nis dominated by contributions from large rbx . Thus,\nwhat matters for the calculation of the matrix element M is the asymptotic value of\na\na\na\nIbx\n\u223c Cbx\nW\u2212\u03b7a ,1/2 (2\u03babx rbx )/rbx , where Cbx\nis the ANC and W is the Whittaker function.\nThis method has been used with great success for many reactions of astrophysical interest\n[ 8, 9], with the advantage of avoiding the treatment of the screening problem [ 7].\nC. Coulomb Excitation and Dissociation\nCoulomb excitation in radioactive beam facilities has been very successful to extract\nThis work was partially supported by the U.S. DOE grants DE-FG02-08ER41533 and DE-FC0207ER41457 (UNEDF, SciDAC-2), the Research Corporation under Award No. 2009-7123.\n\n\u2217\n\n\f2\n\nC.A. Bertulani\n\ninformation on electromagnetic properties of nuclear transitions of astrophysical interest\n[ 10]. A reliable extraction of useful nuclear properties from Coulomb excitation experiments at intermediate and high energies requires a proper treatment of special relativity\n[ 11].\nThe (differential, or angle integrated) Coulomb breakup cross section for a + A \u2212\u2192\n\u03c0\u03bb\nb + c + A is directly proportional to the photo-nuclear cross section \u03c3\u03b3+a\n\u2192 b+c (\u03c9) for the\nmultipolarity \u03c0\u03bb and photon energy \u03c9. Time reversal allows one to deduce the radiative\n\u03c0\u03bb\ncapture cross section b + c \u2212\u2192 a + \u03b3 from \u03c3\u03b3+a\n\u2192 b+c (\u03c9) [ 12]. The method has been used\nsuccessfully in a number of reactions of interest for astrophysics [ 13, 14].\nThe contribution of the nuclear breakup has been examined by several authors (see,\ne.g. [ 15]). 8 B has a small proton separation energy (\u2248 140 keV). For such loosely-bound\nsystems it had been shown that multiple-step, or higher-order effects, are important [ 16].\nD. Charge exchange reactions\nCharge exchange reactions induced in (p, n) reactions are often used to obtain values of\nGamow-Teller matrix elements, B(GT ), which cannot be extracted from beta-decay experiments. This approach relies on the similarity in spin-isospin space of charge-exchange\nreactions and \u03b2-decay operators. As a result of this similarity, the cross section \u03c3(p,\nn) at small momentum transfer q is closely proportional to B(GT ) for strong transitions: d\u03c3\n(q = 0) = KND |J\u03c3\u03c4 |2 B(\u03b1), where K is a kinematical factor, ND is a distortion\ndq\nfactor (accounting for initial and final state interactions), J\u03c3\u03c4 is the Fourier transform\nof the effective nucleon-nucleon interaction, and B(\u03b1 = F, GT ) is the reduced transiP (\u00b1)\ntion probability for non-spin-flip, B(F ) = (2Ji + 1)\u22121 |hf || k \u03c4k ||ii|2, and spin-flip,\nP\n(\u00b1)\nB(GT ) = (2Ji + 1)\u22121 |hf || k \u03c3k \u03c4k ||ii|2, transitions.\nThe above relation, valid for one-step processes, was proven to work rather well for\n(p,n) reactions (with a few exceptions). For heavy ion reactions the formula might not\nwork so well. This has been investigated in refs. [ 17, 18]. In ref. [ 17] it was shown\nthat multistep processes involving the physical exchange of a proton and a neutron can\nstill play an important role up to bombarding energies of 100 MeV/nucleon. Ref. [ 18]\nuses the isospin terms of the effective interaction to show that deviations from the above\nformula is common under many circumstances. As shown in ref. [ 19], for important\nGT transitions whose strength are a small fraction of the sum rule the direct relationship\nbetween \u03c3(p, n) and B(GT ) values also fails to exist. Similar discrepancies have been\nobserved [ 20] for reactions on some odd-A nuclei including 13 C, 15 N, 35 Cl, and 39 K and\nfor charge-exchange induced by heavy ions [ 21].\nBut charge-exchange reactions such as (p,n), (3 He,t) and heavy-ion reactions (A,A\u00b11)\nprovide information on the B(F ) and B(GT ) values needed for astrophysical purposes.\nThis is one of the major research areas in radioactive beam facilities and has been used\nsuccessfully [ 22].\nE. Knock-out reactions\nSingle-nucleon knockout reactions with heavy ions, at intermediate energies and in inverse kinematics, have become a specific and quantitative tool for studying single-particle\noccupancies and correlation effects in the nuclear shell model [ 23, 24]. The experiments\nobserve reactions in which fast, mass A, projectiles collide peripherally with a light nuclear target producing residues with mass (A \u2212 1) [ 24]. The final state of the target and\n\n\fNuclear Astrophysics in Rare Isotope Facilities\n\n3\n\nthat of the struck nucleon are not observed, but instead the energy of the final state of\nthe residue can be identified by measuring coincidences with decay gamma-rays emitted\nin flight.\nNew experimental approaches based on knockout reactions have been developed and\nshown to reduce the uncertainties in astrophysical rapid proton capture (rp) process calculations due to nuclear data. This approach utilizes neutron removal from a radioactive\nion beam to populate the nuclear states of interest. In the first case studied [ 25], 33 Ar,\nexcited states were measured with uncertainties of several keV. The 2 orders of magnitude\nimprovement in the uncertainty of the level energies resulted in a 3 orders of magnitude\nimprovement in the uncertainty of the calculated 32 Cl(p,\u03b3)33 Ar rate that is critical to the\nmodeling of the rp process.\nF. Theoretical efforts\nRecent works [ 26, 27] are paving the way toward a microscopic understanding of the\nmany-body continuum. A basic theoretical question is to what extent we know the form\nof the effective interactions for threshold states. It is hopeless that these methods can\nbe accurate in describing high-lying states in the continuum. In particular, it is not\nworthwhile to pursue this approach to describe direct nuclear reactions.\nA less ambitious goal can be achieved in the coming years by using the Resonating\nGroup Method (RGM) or the Generator Coordinate Method (GCM) [ 28]. These is a set\nof coupled\nintegro-differential equations\nof the form\ni\nP R 3 \u2032 h AB\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nAB\n\u03b1\u2032 d r H\u03b1\u03b1\u2032 (r, r ) \u2212 EN\u03b1\u03b1\u2032 (r, r ) g\u03b1\u2032 (r ) = 0,\n\u2032\n\u2032 \u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032 \u2032\nAB\nAB\nwhere H\u03b1\u03b1\n\u2032 (r, r ) = h\u03a8A (\u03b1, r)|H|\u03a8B (\u03b1 , r )i and N\u03b1\u03b1\u2032 (r, r ) = h\u03a8A (\u03b1, r)|\u03a8B (\u03b1 , r )i. In\nthese equations H is the Hamiltonian for the system of two nuclei (A and B) with the\nenergy E, \u03a8A,B is the wavefunction of nucleus A (and B), and g\u03b1 (r) is a function to be\nfound by numerical solution of the above equation, which describes the relative motion of\nA and B in channel \u03b1. Full antisymmetrization between nucleons of A and B is implicit.\nA simpler method was adopted in ref. [ 29, 30], where an excellent agreement was found\nwith the momentum distributions in knockout reactions of the type 8 B+A \u2212\u2192 7 Be+X\nobtained in experiments at MSU and GSI facilities. The astrophysical S-factor for the\nreaction 7 Be(p, \u03b3)8 B was also calculated and excellent agreement was found with the\nexperimental data in both direct and indirect measurements [ 29, 30].\nField theories adopt a completely independent approach for nuclear physics calculations in which the concept of nuclear potentials is not used. The basic method of field\ntheories is to start with a Lagrangian for the fields. From this Lagrangian one can \"read\"\nthe Feynman diagrams and make practical calculations, after taking care of well-known\ncomplications such as regularization and renormalization. In nuclear astrophysics, this\ntheory has been applied to np \u2192 d\u03b3 for big-bang nucleosynthesis [ 31, 32]; \u03bdd reactions\nfor supernovae physics [ 34] and the solar pp fusion process [ 35]. EFT has also been\nused to deduce observables in reactions with halo nuclei and loosely bound states, with\npromising applications to astrophysics [ 36, 37, 38].\nREFERENCES\n1. \"Nuclear Astrophysics with Radioactive Beams\", C.A.
