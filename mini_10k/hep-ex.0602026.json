The HERA ep collider allows the exploration of DIS at high values\nof the negative four-momentum-transfer squared, Q2 . Using data taken in the years 19942000 the H1 and ZEUS collaborations have reported measurements of the cross sections\nfor charged current (CC) and neutral current (NC) DIS [1\u201310]. These measurements\nextend the kinematic region covered by fixed-target experiments [11] to higher Q2 values\nand probe the electroweak sector of the Standard Model.\nPolarised electron-nucleon deep inelastic scattering was first performed in the 1970s at\nlow values of Q2 . The results established parity violation attributable to the weak neutral\ncurrent [12]. Since 2002, the upgraded HERA collider has delivered longitudinally polarised lepton beams to the collider experiments. The luminosity was also higher than in\nprevious years. In the kinematic range of HERA, the SM predicts that the cross sections\nfor charged and neutral current ep DIS should exhibit specific dependencies on the longitudinal polarisation of the incoming lepton beam. The absence of right-handed charged\ncurrents leads to the prediction that the charged current cross section will be a linear function of polarisation, vanishing for right-handed (left-handed) electron (positron) beams.\nThis paper presents measurements of the cross sections for e+ p CC and NC DIS at high\nQ2 with longitudinally polarised positron beams using the ZEUS detector. The measurements are based on 11.5 pb\u22121 of data collected between April and June 2004 at a mean\nluminosity-weighted polarisation of \u22120.41, and 12.3 pb\u22121 collected between June and August 2004 at a polarisation of +0.32. During this time HERA collided protons of energy\n920 GeV with positrons of energy 27.5 GeV, yielding collisions at a centre-of-mass energy\nof 318 GeV. The measured cross sections are compared to the predictions of the SM.\nSimilar results have recently been published by the H1 Collaboration [13].\n\n2\n\nStandard Model predictions\n\nInclusive deep inelastic lepton-proton scattering can be described in terms of the kinematic\nvariables x and Q2 . The variable Q2 is defined by Q2 = \u2212q 2 = \u2212(k \u2212 k \u2032 )2 where k and\nk \u2032 are the four-momenta of the incoming and scattered lepton, respectively. Bjorken x\nis defined by x = Q2 /(2P * q), where P is the four-momentum of the incoming proton.\nThe inelasticity variable y is determined from Q2 = sxy, where s is the square of the\nlepton-proton centre-of-mass energy (neglecting the masses of the incoming particles).\n\n1\n\n\fThe electroweak Born level cross section for the CC reaction\ne+ p \u2192 \u03bd\u0304e X,\nwith a longitudinally polarised positron beam, can be expressed at leading order in QCD\nas [14]\n\u0012\n\u00132 \u0014\n\u0015\n2\nd2 \u03c3 CC (e+ p)\nG2F\nMW\nCC\n2\nCC\n2\n= (1 + Pe )\n* Y+ F2 (x, Q ) \u2212 Y\u2212 xF3 (x, Q ) ,\n2\ndxdQ2\n4\u03c0x MW\n+ Q2\nwhere GF is the Fermi constant, MW is the mass of the W boson and Y\u00b1 = 1 \u00b1 (1 \u2212 y)2 .\nThe structure-functions F2CC and xF3CC may be written in terms of sums and differences\nof quark and antiquark parton density functions (PDFs) of the proton as follows:\nF2CC = x[d(x, Q2 ) + s(x, Q2 ) + \u016b(x, Q2 ) + c\u0304(x, Q2 )],\nxF3CC = x[d(x, Q2 ) + s(x, Q2 ) \u2212 \u016b(x, Q2 ) \u2212 c\u0304(x, Q2 )],\nwhere, for example, the PDF d(x, Q2 ) gives the number density of down quarks with\nmomentum-fraction x at a given Q2 . The longitudinal polarisation of the positron beam\nis defined as\n\nPe =\n\nNR \u2212 NL\n,\nNR + NL\n\nwhere NR and NL are the numbers of right1 - and left-handed positrons in the beam,\nrespectively. Similarly the cross section for the NC reaction\ne+ p \u2192 e+ X,\ncan be expressed as [14]\nd2 \u03c3 NC (e+ p)\n2\u03c0\u03b12 +\n=\n[H \u2212 Pe HP+e ],\ndxdQ2\nxQ4 0\n1\n\nAt HERA beam energies the mass of the incoming leptons may be neglected, and therefore the difference between handedness and helicity may also be neglected.\n\n2\n\n\fwhere \u03b1 is the QED coupling constant and H0+ and HP+e contain the unpolarised and\npolarised structure functions, respectively, such that at leading order in QCD\nH0+ = Y+ F20 \u2212 Y\u2212 xF30 ,\n\nF20 =\n\nX\n\nx(+q\u0304)A0q ,\n\nxF30 =\n\nq\n\nX\nq\n\nx(q \u2212 q\u0304)Bq0 ,\n\nand\n\nHP+e = Y+ F2Pe \u2212 Y\u2212 xF3Pe ,\n\nF2Pe =\n\nX\n\nx(q + q\u0304)APq e ,\n\nxF3Pe =\n\nq\n\nX\nq\n\nx(q \u2212 q\u0304)BqPe ,\n\nwhere q(x, Q2 ) and q\u0304(x, Q2 ) are the quark and antiquark PDFs, respectively, and the sums\nrun over the five active quark flavours. The A and B coefficients contain the quark and\npositron couplings to the photon and Z boson and are given by\nA0q = e2q \u2212 2eq vq ve \u03c7Z + (vq2 + a2q )(ve2 + a2e )\u03c72Z ,\nBq0 = \u22122eq aq ae \u03c7Z + 4vq aq ve ae \u03c72Z ,\nand\nAPq e = 2eq vq ae \u03c7Z \u2212 2(vq2 + a2q )ve ae \u03c72Z ,\nBqPe = 2eq aq ve \u03c7Z \u2212 2vq aq (ve2 + a2e )\u03c72Z ,\nwhere ef is the electric charge in units of the positron charge and af and vf are the\naxial and vector couplings of the fermion f . The couplings are defined by af = I3f and\nvf = I3f \u2212 2ef sin2 \u03b8W where I3f is the third component of weak isospin and \u03b8W is the\nWeinberg angle. The quantity \u03c7Z is proportional to the ratio of the Z 0 and photon\npropagators:\n1\n\u03c7Z =\n2\nsin 2\u03b8W\n\n\u0012\n\nwhere MZ is the mass of the Z 0 boson.\n\n3\n\n\u0013\nQ2\n,\nMZ2 + Q2\n\n\f3\n\nExperimental apparatus\n\nA detailed description of the ZEUS detector can be found elsewhere [15]. A brief outline\nof the components most relevant for this analysis is given below.\nCharged particles are tracked in the central tracking detector (CTD) [16], which operates\nin a magnetic field of 1.43 T provided by a thin superconducting solenoid. The CTD\nconsists of 72 cylindrical drift chamber layers, organised in nine superlayers covering the\npolar-angle2 region 15\u25e6 < \u03b8 < 164\u25e6 . In 2001 a silicon microvertex detector (MVD) [17]\nwas installed between the beampipe and the inner radius of the CTD. The MVD is\norganised into a barrel with 3 cylindrical layers and a forward section with four planar\nlayers perpendicular to the HERA beam direction. The barrel contains 600 single-sided\nsilicon strip sensors each having 512 strips of width 120 \u03bcm; the forward section contains\n112 sensors each of which has 480 strips of width 120 \u03bcm. Charged-particle tracks were\nreconstructed using information from the CTD and MVD.\nThe high-resolution uranium\u2013scintillator calorimeter (CAL) [18] consists of three parts:\nthe forward (FCAL), the barrel (BCAL) and the rear (RCAL) calorimeter, covering 99.7%\nof the solid angle around the nominal interaction point. Each part is subdivided transversely into towers and longitudinally into one electromagnetic section (EMC) and either\none (in RCAL) or two (in BCAL and FCAL) hadronic sections (HAC). The smallest\nsubdivision of the calorimeter is called a cell. The CAL relative energy resolutions,\n\u221a\nas measured under test-beam conditions, are \u03c3(E)/E = 0.18/ E for electrons and\n\u221a\n\u03c3(E)/E = 0.35/ E for hadrons, with E in GeV. The timing resolution of the CAL\nis better than 1 ns for energy deposits exceeding 4.5 GeV. The position of the interaction\nvertex along the beam direction can be reconstructed from the arrival time of energy\ndeposits in FCAL. The resolution is about 10 cm for events with FCAL energy above\n25 GeV, improving to about 8 cm for FCAL energy above 100 GeV.\nAn iron structure that surrounds the CAL is instrumented as a backing calorimeter\n(BAC) [19] to measure energy leakage from the CAL. Muon chambers in the forward,\nbarrel and rear [20] regions are used in this analysis to veto background events induced\nby cosmic-ray or beam-halo muons.\nThe luminosity was measured using the Bethe-Heitler reaction ep \u2192 e\u03b3p by the luminosity\ndetector which consists of two independent systems. In the first system the photons are\ndetected by a lead\u2013scintillator calorimeter placed in the HERA tunnel 107 m from the\n2\n\nThe ZEUS coordinate system is a right-handed Cartesian system, with the Z axis pointing in the\nproton beam direction, referred to as the \"forward direction\", and the X axis pointing left towards\nthe centre of HERA. The polar angle, \u03b8, is measured with respect to the proton beam direction. The\ncoordinate origin is at the nominal interaction point.\n\n4\n\n\finteraction point in the positron-beam direction. The system used in previous ZEUS\npublications [21] was modified by the addition of active filters in order to suppress the\nincreased synchrotron radiation background of the upgraded HERA collider. The second\nsystem is a magnetic spectrometer arrangement [22]. A small fraction (\u223c 9%) of the\nsmall-angle energetic photons from the Bethe-Heitler process convert in the exit window\nof the vacuum chamber. Electron-positron pairs from the converted photons were bent\nvertically by a dipole magnet and detected in tungsten-scintillator calorimeters located\nabove and below the photon beam at Z = \u2212104 m. The advantage of the spectrometer\nsystem is that it does not suffer from pile-up (multiple interactions at high luminosity)\nand is not sensitive to direct synchrotron radiation, whereas the calorimeter system has\nhigher acceptance. The fractional uncertainty on the measured luminosity was 3.5%.\nThe lepton beam in HERA becomes naturally transversely polarised through the SokolovTernov effect [23]. The characteristic build-up time expected for the HERA accelerator\nis approximately 40 minutes. Spin rotators on either side of the ZEUS detector change\nthe transverse polarisation of the beam into longitudinal polarisation. The positron beam\npolarisation was measured using two independent polarimeters, the transverse polarimeter\n(TPOL) [24] and the longitudinal polarimeter (LPOL) [25]. Both devices exploit the\nspin-dependent cross section for Compton scattering of circularly polarised photons off\npositrons to measure the beam polarisation. The transverse polarimeter was upgraded in\n2001 to provide a fast measurement for every positron bunch, and position-sensitive silicon\nstrip and scintillating-fibre detectors were added to investigate systematic effects [26]. The\nluminosity and polarisation measurements were made over times that were much shorter\nthan the polarisation build-up time.\n\n4\n\nMonte Carlo simulation\n\nMonte Carlo (MC) simulations were used to determine the efficiency for selecting events\nand the accuracy of kinematic reconstruction, to estimate the ep background rate and\nto extrapolate the measured cross sections to the full kinematic region. A sufficient\nnumber of events were generated to ensure that uncertainties from MC statistics were\nsmall compared to other uncertainties.\nNeutral and charged current DIS events including radiative effects were simulated using\nthe Djangoh [27] generator. The polarisation dependence of radiative effects in CC\nDIS, neglected in Djangoh, was checked using the Grace [28] program and found to\nbe negligible. The hadronic final state was simulated using the colour-dipole model of\nAriadne 4.10 [29] and, as a systematic check, the Meps model of Lepto 6.5 [30].\nBoth programs use the Lund string model of Jetset 7.4 [31] for the hadronisation. The\n\n5\n\n\fphotoproduction background was estimated using events simulated with Herwig 5.9 [32].\nDiffractive NC events were generated using the Rapgap 2.08/06 [33] program and mixed\nwith the non-diffractive MC events in order to simulate the hadronic final state accurately.\nBackground to the CC signal from W production was estimated using the Epvec 1.0 [34]\ngenerator and background from the production of charged-lepton pairs was generated\nusing the Grape 1.1 [35] program.\nThe vertex distribution in data is a crucial input to the MC simulation for the correct\nevaluation of the event-selection efficiency. Therefore, the Z-vertex distribution used in\nthe MC simulation was determined from a sample of NC DIS events in which the eventselection efficiency was independent of Z.\n\n5\n\nKinematic Reconstruction\n\nCharged current events are characterised by a large missing transverse momentum, PT,miss ,\nthe magnitude of which is calculated as\n\n2\nPT,miss\n= Px2 + Py2 =\n\nX\n\nEi sin \u03b8i cos \u03c6i\n\ni\n\n!2\n\n+\n\nX\ni\n\nEi sin \u03b8i sin \u03c6i\n\n!2\n\n,\n\nwhere the sum runs over all calorimeter energy deposits Ei , (corrected [4] for energy loss\nin inactive material and other effects in the offline analysis) and \u03b8i and \u03c6i are the polar\nand azimuthal angles of the calorimeter energy deposit as viewed from the interaction\n2\n2\nvertex. The hadronic polar angle, \u03b3h , is defined by cos \u03b3h = (PT,miss\n\u2212 \u03b4 2 )/(PT,miss\n+ \u03b4 2 ),\nP\nP\nwhere \u03b4 = (Ei \u2212Ei cos \u03b8i ) = (E \u2212Pz )i . In the naive Quark Parton Model, \u03b3h gives the\nscattering angle of the struck quark in the lab frame. The total transverse energy, ET , is\nP\ngiven by ET = Ei sin \u03b8i . The kinematic variables xJB , yJB and Q2JB for charged current\nevents were reconstructed from the measured PT,miss and \u03b4 using the Jacquet-Blondel\nmethod [36].\nNeutral current events are characterised by the presence of a high-energy isolated scattered\npositron in the detector. It follows from longitudinal momentum conservation that for\nwell measured NC events, \u03b4 peaks at twice the positron beam energy or 55 GeV. The\nhadronic transverse momentum, PT,h , and \u03b4h were calculated in the same way as the\ncorresponding quantities in CC events, but excluding energy deposits associated with the\nscattered positron. The hadronic polar angle, \u03b3h , was calculated from PT,h , and \u03b4h in\nthe same way as the CC case. The scattered positron energy, Ee\u2032 , and polar angle, \u03b8e ,\nwere determined from the energy deposit and matched track of the scattered positron\ncandidate, respectively.\n\n6\n\n\fThe double-angle method [37] was used to estimate the kinematic variables xDA , yDA and\nQ2DA for the neutral current events using the measured values of \u03b8e and \u03b3h .\n\n6\n\nEvent selection\n\nZEUS operates a three-level trigger system [15, 38]. Charged current events were selected\nusing criteria based on missing transverse momentum measured by the CAL [9]. Neutral\ncurrent DIS events were selected using criteria based on an energy deposit in the CAL\nconsistent with an isolated positron [10].\n\n6.1\n\nCharged current\n\nThe following criteria were imposed to select CC events and to reject background:\n\u2022 missing transverse momentum: PT,miss > 12 GeV was required and, in addition, the\nmissing transverse momentum, excluding the calorimeter cells adjacent to the forward\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nbeam hole, PT,miss\n, was required to satisfy PT,miss\n> 10 GeV. The PT,miss\ncut strongly\nsuppresses beam-gas events while maintaining high efficiency for CC events;\n\u2022 primary vertex: events were required to satisfy |ZVTX | < 50 cm. The Z coordinate of\nthe vertex, reconstructed using the tracking detectors, was required to be consistent\nwith that of an ep interaction. For events with an hadronic angle, \u03b3h , of less than\n23\u25e6 , the vertex Z position was reconstructed from the measured arrival time of energy\n\u2032\ndeposits in FCAL [39], and the PT,miss and PT,miss\nthresholds were increased to 14 and\n12 GeV, respectively;\n\u2022 rejection of photoproduction: PT,miss/ET > 0.4 was required for events with 20 <\nPT,miss < 30 GeV; PT,miss/ET > 0.55 was required for events with PT,miss < 20 GeV.\nThese requirements select events with an azimuthally collimated energy flow. In addition, it was required that the angle between the transverse momentum measured\nusing the tracks and that measured by the calorimeter was less than one radian for\nevents with PT,miss < 30 GeV;\n\u2022 rejection of NC DIS: NC DIS events in which the scattered positron or the hadronic\nsystem is poorly measured can have significant missing transverse momentum. Events\nwith \u03b4 > 30 GeV and an isolated electromagnetic cluster with energy of at least 4 GeV\nmeasured in the calorimeter were rejected;\n\u2022 rejection of non-ep background: interactions between one of the beams and the residual\ngas in the beam pipe or upstream accelerator components can lead to events with\nsignificant missing transverse momentum. However, for such interactions, the arrival\n\n7\n\n\ftimes of energy deposits in the calorimeter are inconsistent with the bunch-crossing\ntime and were used to reject such events. Muon-finding algorithms based on tracking,\ncalorimeter and muon-chamber information were used to reject events caused by cosmic\nrays or muons in the beam halo. In addition, the shape of hadronic showers in the\ncalorimeter was used to reject halo-muon events depositing energy in the forward\ncalorimeter. Further details can be found elsewhere [40, 41];\n\u2022 kinematic region: events were required to satisfy Q2JB > 200 GeV2 and yJB < 0.9.\nThese requirements restricted the event sample to a region where the resolution of the\nkinematic quantities was good and the background was small [9].\nAll events were visually inspected; 12 cosmic-ray and halo-muon events were removed\nfrom the negative-polarisation sample and 8 from the positive-polarisation sample. A\ntotal of 158 data events satisfied all criteria in the negative-polarisation sample and 311\nin the positive-polarisation sample.\nThe main background remaining after the selection was photoproduction events, the cross\nsection for which is independent of the longitudinal polarisation of the positron beam. The\ncontamination was estimated from MC to be typically less than 1% but was as high as\n5% in the lowest-Q2 bin of the negative-polarisation sample.\nFigure 1 shows a comparison of data and MC distributions for the CC sample. The MC\nsample, which was weighted to the measured polarisations and luminosities of the data\nsamples, gives a satisfactory description of the data.\n\n6.2\n\nNeutral current\n\nThe following criteria were imposed to select NC events:\n\u2022 positron identification: an algorithm which combined information from the energy\ndeposits in the calorimeter with tracks was used to identify scattered positrons. A\nfiducial-volume cut was applied to guarantee that the experimental acceptance was\nwell understood [10]. To ensure high purity and reject background, the identified\npositron was required to have an energy of at least 10 GeV and be isolated such that\nthe energy in an \u03b7 \u2212 \u03c6 cone of radius 0.8 centred on the positron, but not associated\nwith it, was less than 5 GeV. For events in which a positron was found within the\nacceptance of the tracking detectors, a track matched to the energy deposit in the\ncalorimeter was required. For events with a positron at a smaller polar angle than\nthe acceptance of the tracking detectors, the track requirement was replaced with the\nrequirement that the transverse momentum of the positron exceed 30 GeV;\n\u2022 primary vertex: events were required to satisfy |ZVTX | < 50 cm. The Z coordinate of\nthe ep interaction vertex was reconstructed using tracks;\n\n8\n\n\f\u2022 background rejection: the requirement 38 < \u03b4 < 65 GeV was imposed to remove photoproduction and beam-gas events, and to reduce the number of events with significant\nQED initial-state radiation. The lower threshold was increased to 44 GeV for events\nwhich did not have a track matched to the positron candidate. To further reduce background from photoproduction, y calculated using the electron method was required\nto satisfy ye < 0.95. The net transverse momentum is expected to be small, so, in\norder to remove cosmic-ray events and beam related background events, the quantity\n\u221a\n\u221a\nPT,miss / ET was required to be less than 4 GeV, and the quantity PT,miss /ET was\nrequired to be less than 0.7;\n\u2022 QED Compton rejection: to reduce the size of the QED radiative corrections, elastic Compton-scattering events were rejected. The contribution from deeply-virtual\nCompton scattering was negligible;\n\u2022 kinematic region: to avoid regions of phase space in which the MC generator was not\nvalid, the quantity yJB (1 \u2212 xDA ) was required to be greater than 0.004. The final event\nsample was defined by requiring Q2DA > 200 GeV2 .\nA total of 20642 events passed the selection criteria in the negative polarisation sample and\n22395 in the positive polarisation sample. The background contamination, dominated by\nmisidentified photoproduction, was typically less than 1%. Figure 2 shows a comparison\nof data and MC distributions for the NC sample. The MC sample gives a generally good\ndescription of the data. The effect of the positron fiducial-volume cuts can be seen in the\npositron angle (\u223c 2.4 rad) and Q2 (\u223c 600 GeV2 ) distributions.\n\n7\n\nCross section determination\n\nThe measured cross section in a particular kinematic bin, for example in d\u03c3/dQ2 , was\ndetermined from\nSM\nNdata \u2212 Nbg d\u03c3Born\nd\u03c3Born\n*\n=\n,\ndQ2\nNMC\ndQ2\n\nwhere Ndata is the number of data events, Nbg is the number of background events estimated from the MC simulation and NMC is the number of signal MC events. The SM\nSM\nprediction d\u03c3Born\n/dQ2 was evaluated in the on-shell scheme using the PDG [42] values for\nthe electroweak parameters and the CTEQ5D PDFs [43]. Consequently, the acceptance,\nas well as the bin-centring and radiative corrections were all taken from the MC simulation. The radiative corrections define the measured cross section to have only tree-level\nQED and electroweak contributions. A similar procedure was used for d\u03c3/dx and d\u03c3/dy.\n\n9\n\n\fThe major sources of systematic uncertainty in the CC cross sections come from the\nuncertainties in calorimeter energy scale and the parton-shower scheme. The former was\nestimated using a method detailed in previous publications [7, 9] for the NC data sample.\nThe resulting shifts in the cross sections were typically less than 10%, but increased to\n20% in the highest Q2 bin and 30% in the highest x bin.\nTo estimate the sensitivity of the results to the details of the simulation of the hadronic\nfinal state, the Lepto Meps model was used instead of the Ariadne model for calculating the acceptance corrections. The largest effects of \u223c 5% were observed in the highest\nQ2 and x bins.\nThe uncertainty in the small contribution from photoproduction was estimated by fitting\na linear combination of the PT,miss /ET distributions of the signal and the background MC\nsamples to the corresponding distribution in the data, allowing the normalisation of the\nphotoproduction MC events to vary. No cut on PT,miss /ET was applied for this check.\nVarying the normalisation of the photoproduction events by the uncertainty in the fit of\n\u00b130% resulted in changes of the measured cross sections within \u00b13%.\nThe systematic uncertainties of the selection cuts were estimated by varying the threshold\nvalue of each selection cut independently by around 10%, which is a reasonable match to\nthe resolution. The resulting shifts in the cross sections were typically within \u00b15%.\nA major source of systematic uncertainty in the NC cross section came from the uncertainty in the parton-shower scheme, which gave changes in the cross section of typically\nwithin \u00b12% but up to 4% at high Q2 . Uncertainty in the electromagnetic energy scale was\nestimated by varying the energy scale by \u00b11%. However, due to the use of the doubleangle reconstruction, the resulting shifts in the cross section were typically < 0.5%. The\nsystematic effects of the selection cuts were estimated by varying the threshold value\nof each selection cut independently by values commensurate with the resolutions. The\nresulting shifts in the cross sections were typically within \u00b11%.\nThe individual uncertainties were added in quadrature separately for the positive and\nnegative deviations from the nominal cross-section values to obtain the total systematic\nuncertainty. The uncertainty in the measured polarisation, \u03b4Pe /Pe , was 1.6% using the\nLPOL and 3.5% using the TPOL. The choice of polarimeter measurement was made to\nmaximise the available luminosity for the analysis, while minimising the uncertainty in\nthe measured polarisation, on a run-by-run basis.\nThe relative uncertainty in the measured luminosity of 3.5% was not included in the total\nuncertainty shown in the differential cross-section figures.\n\n10\n\n\f8\n\nResults\n\nIn the following, measurements of total cross sections and differential cross sections in\nx, y and Q2 for the charged current reaction are presented. In addition, cross sections\ndifferential in Q2 were measured for the neutral current reaction.\nThe total cross sections for e+ p CC DIS in the kinematic region Q2 > 200 GeV2 are\n\u03c3 CC (Pe = 0.32 \u00b1 0.01) = 42.8 \u00b1 2.4(stat.) \u00b1 1.9(syst.) pb,\nand\n\u03c3 CC (Pe = \u22120.41 \u00b1 0.01) = 23.3 \u00b1 1.9(stat.) \u00b1 1.0(syst.) pb.\nincluding the uncertainty from the measured luminosity. The total cross section is shown\nas a function of the longitudinal polarisation of the positron beam in Fig. 3, including the\nunpolarised ZEUS measurement from the 1999-2000 data [9]. The data are compared to\nthe Standard Model prediction evaluated using the ZEUS-JETS [44] and CTEQ6D [45]\nPDFs. The SM prediction describes the data well. A linear fit to the data yields an\nextrapolated value of\n\u03c3 CC (Pe = \u22121) = 7.4 \u00b1 3.9(stat.) \u00b1 1.2(syst.) pb,\nwith \u03c72 = 0.1, consistent within two standard deviations with the absence of right-handed\ncharged currents in the SM. In the fit, the systematic uncertainties of the two polarised\ndata points were considered fully correlated and the uncertainities in the measured polarisation fully anti-correlated. The systematic uncertainty in the unpolarised data point\nwas considered to be uncorrelated with the polarised points.\nThe single-differential cross-sections d\u03c3/dQ2, d\u03c3/dx and d\u03c3/dy for charged current DIS\nare shown in Fig. 4. A clear difference is observed between the measurements for positive\nand negative longitudinal polarisation, which is independent of the kinematic variables.\nThe effects are well described by the SM evaluated using the ZEUS-JETS PDFs.\nFigure 5 shows the differential cross-section d\u03c3/dQ2 for NC DIS for positive and negative longitudinal polarisations and the ratio of the two cross sections. Only statistical\nuncertainties were considered when taking the ratio of the positively and negatively polarised cross sections. The measurements are well described by the SM evaluated using\nthe ZEUS-JETS PDFs and are consistent with the expectations of the electroweak Standard Model for polarised NC DIS. A \u03c72 test for the Q2 > 1000 GeV2 data points yields\n\u03c72 = 0.3 per data point for the SM and 1.5 for no polarisation dependence.\n\n11\n\n\f9\n\nSummary\n\nThe cross sections for charged and neutral current deep inelastic scattering in e+ p collisions\nwith a longitudinally polarised positron beam have been measured. The measurements\nare the first from the ZEUS collaboration in the second phase of HERA operation and are\nbased on data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 23.8 pb\u22121 collected in 2004 at a\ncentre-of-mass energy of 318 GeV. The cross sections for e+ p charged current deep inelastic scattering are different for positive and negative values of the positron beam longitudinal polarisation. In addition, single differential cross sections are presented for charged\nand neutral current deep inelastic scattering in the kinematic region Q2 > 200 GeV2 . The\nmeasured cross sections are well described by the predictions of the Standard Model. A fit\nto the cross-section measurements yields \u03c3 CC (Pe = \u22121) = 7.4 \u00b1 3.9(stat.) \u00b1 1.2(syst.) pb,\nwhich is within two standard deviations of the prediction of the Standard Model of zero.\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe are grateful to the DESY directorate for their strong support and encouragement.\nWe thank the HERA machine group whose outstanding efforts resulted in the successful\nupgrade of the HERA accelerator which made this work possible.
