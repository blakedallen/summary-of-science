The past decade has shown that, in\naddition to transport experiments, optical spectroscopies, especially photoluminescence (PL)\nspectroscopy, can provide valuable further information about the ground state properties of\nthe systems. In fact, this method has in recent years been applied to study an interactiong\n2DES in the regime of the FQHE [2\u20135], where a variety of anomalies in both, the energetic\npositions and the intensities of the PL lines, were found. The striking difference in optical\nexperiments, compared to electron transport, is the presence of photo-excited holes. Though\nit was previously shown that in symmetric systems in the high magnetic field limit the\nelectron-electron and electron-hole interactions cancel exactly due to a hidden symmetry\n[6\u20138], for most of the real systems this symmetry is violated.\nIn order to systematically understand the interactions between electrons and photoexcited holes in modulation-doped systems, it seems natural to start with zero density of\nthe 2DES and gradually increase the number of free electrons. In fact, it was found that\nin dilute 2DES the Coulomb attraction between electrons and holes leads to the formation\nof negatively charged excitons, consisting of two electrons and one hole [9\u201311]. It is now\ncommonly accepted that at zero magnetic field the two electrons form a spin singlet state\n(total spin S = 0). At finite magnetic field, an additional bound state exists, where the\nelectrons form a spin triplet (S = 1) [12,13]. It was calculated that at high magnetic fields\nthe triplet exciton (Xt\u2212 ) forms the ground state of the system. Magnetic fields of 30-40 T\nwere predicted for the singlet triplet crossing for symmetric quantum-well systems [14\u201316].\nFor some time, experimental attempts to detect this singlet triplet crossing failed. Instead,\na saturation of the Xt\u2212 binding energy was found at high fields [12,13,17,18]. This puzzle\nwas recently solved by a theoretical work of A. Wojs et al. [19]. The authors calculated the\nspectrum of charged excitons by exact diagonalization of finite size systems. It was found\n[19] that at high magnetic field two different triplet excitons exist as bound states. One of\nthese excitons has a total angular momentum of L = 0, and is therefore called the bright\n\u2212\ntriplet (Xtb\u2212 ). The second triplet exciton is called the dark triplet (Xtd\n) because it can not\n\u2212\ndecay radiatively (L = \u22121). The calculations showed that the Xtd becomes the ground\nstate at high fields and the experimentally observed saturation of the binding energy can\nbe attributed to the bright triplet. In a subsequent work, I. Szlurfarska et al. found that in\nasymmetric quantum wells the singlet triplet crossing can be at considerably lower fields [20].\nVery recently, the observation of an excitation in PL experiments, which was interpreted\nas a dark triplet exciton, was reported by two different groups [21,22]. The singlet triplet\ncrossing occured at B = 40 T [21,23] and B = 15 T [22]. However, there seem to be some\ndiscrepancies betweeen these reports, e.g., in Ref. [21] the dark triplet is visible over the\nwhole magnetic field range.\nIn this paper we report results which are concerning the PL experiments consistent with\nthe observation of G. Yusa et al. [22], i.e., (i) we observe a charged exciton at very low\ntemperatures, which is not present in the spectrum at T = 2 K, (ii) this exciton occurs for\nfilling factor \u03bd < 1/3 only, i.e., related to the FQHE regime, and, (iii) the PL intensity of\nthis excitation is of similar strength as that of the X 0 .\nAt the first sight it is intriguing that a dark mode should appear in the PL spectrum with\nalmost equal strengths as the bright modes, since its oscillator strength should by definition\n2\n\n\fbe exactly zero. However, it is well known that the PL intensity and linewidth might not\nreflect directly the oscillator strength of a transition, which is proportional to 1/\u03c4X , where\n\u03c4X is the lifetime of the excitation. The PL intensity is proportional to NX /\u03c4X , i.e., it does\nalso depend on the number of excitons NX . Due to relaxation and scattering processes,\nwhich can take place prior to the recombination process, the excitons at lower energies may\nhave a larger population than the excitons at higher energies. Therefore, in PL, the factor\nNX may overcome a small oscillator strength 1/\u03c4X and lead to a significant PL signal. A\ndirect determination of the oscillator strength, however, can only come from an absorption\nmeasurement. Therefore, we have prepared optically thin samples. We were able to integrate\nexternal gates to the thinned samples, which allow us to tune the carrier density down to the\ndilute regime. This enabled us to measure, to the best of our knowledge, for the first time,\ndirect absorption of charged excitons at millikelvin temperatures in a dilution cryostat and\ncompare it to PL. We were thus able to determine the oscillator strengths of the observed\nexcitations. We believe that in our investigation we can clearly identify this charged exciton\nas a dark exciton of the GaAs quantum well for two main reasons. (i) In the optically thin\nsamples no GaAs bulk material is left so that we can definitely rule out any bulk-related\neffects. (ii) By comparing PL and transmission at very low temperatures, we find that the\n\u2212\noscillator strength of the excitation labeled Xtd\nis close to zero which unambiguously shows\nthat this is a dark mode.\nThe samples are one-sided modulation-doped GaAs-AlGaAs single quantum wells, consisting of a 25 nm wide GaAs quantum well with a 88 nm AlGaAs spacer between the\nquantum well and the doped barrier region on one side, and a 100 period AlGaAs/GaAs (10\nnm / 3 nm per period) superlattice on the other side. On top of the sample, a 10 nm thick\ntitanium gate was deposited. The sample was glued upside down on a glass substrate using\nan UV curing optical adhesive. Subsequently, the sample was thinned from the back side by\na selective etching process [24] down to the superlattice to a total thickness of about 1.3 \u03bcm.\nBy applying a negative gate voltage, we can tune the density in the range between about\n1 \u00d71010 cm\u22122 and 1 \u00d71011 cm\u22122 . PL and absorption measurements were performed via glass\nfibers in a 3 He/4 He dilution cryostat at a base temperature of T = 40 mK and magnetic\nfields up to 16 T. A sensor at the sample position indicated that during illumination the\ntemperature directly at the sample is about T = 100 mK, while the base temperature is\nstill T = 40 mK. Circularly polarized light was created directly inside the mixing chamber\nand left and right circularly polarized spectra were measured by ramping the magnet from\npositive to negative magnetic fields. For the PL, the sample was excited by a Ti:Sapphire\nlaser at 750 nm. For the absorption measurement, a white light source was used.\nFigure 1 shows a comparison of left-circularly polarized PL spectra, which were recorded\nat T = 2 K (upper spectrum) in an optical split-coil magnet, and at T = 100 mK (lower\nspectrum) in the dilution cryostat. In this polarization configuration, at T = 2 K, the wellknown lower Zeeman components of the singlet exciton Xs\u2212 and the neutral exciton X 0 ,\nand the bright triplet Xtb\u2212 with parallel spin orientation of the electrons are visible. In the\n\u2212\nspectrum at T = 100 mK a strong line (labeled Xtd\n) appears in between the Xs\u2212 and the\nXtb\u2212 . We will argue below that this exciton is indeed a dark triplet exciton. Due to small\nsample inhomogeneities, the peaks in different measurement series do not always occur at\nexactly the same absolute positions. Therefore, in Fig. 1, the spectrum at T = 0.1 K has\nbeen shifted by 0.16 meV so that the positions of the X 0 is the same in both spectra. For\n3\n\n\fboth spectra, the density is in the range (2 \u00b1 1) \u00d7 1010 cm\u22122 . We have recorded extensive\nseries of spectra for different gate voltages in dependence on magnetic field. Throughout\n\u2212\nthe whole magnetic field range, the Xtd\nis not detectable at all at T = 2 K. For T = 100\n\u2212\nmK, our finding is that the Xtd is present in the spectra for filling factors \u03bd < 1/3, which\nis consistent with the results reported in Ref. [22]. As examples, in Fig. 2, series of leftcircularly polarized spectra are displayed for two different gate voltages, i.e., two different\ndensities in the range of 1010 cm\u22122 . For the higher electron density (Fig. 2a) one can see\n\u2212\nthat the neutral exciton X 0 is not visible in the displayed magnetic field range and the Xtd\nsplits from the bright triplet Xtb\u2212 for \u03bd < 1/3. At significantly lower density (Fig. 2b), this\nsplitting occurs at lower magnetic field (\u2248 2 T in Fig. 2b), and, at high fields, the neutral\nexciton X 0 is visible. Consistent with the behavior predicted in Ref. [19], the binding energy\n\u2212\nof the Xtd\nincreases with magnetic field and the PL line approaches the Xs\u2212 at high field\n(see Fig. 2b). However, we note here that up to the highest field in our experiment (16 T)\nwe did not observe the predicted singlet triplet crossing. We assume that it will occur at\nsomewhat higher fields. According to the calculations in Ref. [20], the magnetic field value\nfor the crossing should depend critically on the electron hole separation d perpendicular to\n\u2212\nthe 2DES sheet. By comparing our experimentally observed binding energies of the Xtd\nwith calculations (e.g. [15,20]), we can estimate for our structures d < 0.5 nm.\n\u2212\nIn the following we demonstrate that the observed Xtd\nis indeed a dark mode. Figure 3\ndepicts absorption spectra in dependence on magnetic field at T = 100 mK for an electron\ndensity of n \u2248 2 \u00d7 1010 cm\u22122 . One can clearly see absorption due to the bright excitons\nXs\u2212 , Xtb\u2212 , and X 0 . Remarkably, in Fig. 3 the neutral exciton X 0 has the highest absorption,\ni.e., the largest oscillator strength, which is proportional to 1/\u03c4X0 . As explained in the\nintroduction, this is not directly reflected in the PL experiments (see Fig. 4), since the\nintensity of a PL line does via NX /\u03c4X also depend on the number of excitons NX . From Fig.\n\u2212\n4 one can see that the Xtd\ndoes not appear in the absorption spectrum, though it exhibits\na well developed line in the PL spectrum. From our signal-to-noise ratio we can estimate\n\u2212\nthat the Xtd\nhas an oscillator strength which is at least one order of magnitude smaller\n\u2212\nthan the oscillator strength of X 0 . This can be taken as a clear signature that the Xtd\nis\nindeed a dark mode. According to Ref. [19], the total angular momentum of this mode is\nL = \u22121. Therefore, in an idealized system, without scattering, it can not decay radiatively.\nThis means, its lifetime \u03c4 should go to infinity and hence the oscillator strength 1/\u03c4 to zero.\nThis is directly reflected in the absorption spectra in Fig. 3. On the other hand, due to\nscattering processes prior to recombination, in PL the selection rule L = 0 can be lifted. We\nbelieve that such scattering-assisted recombination can be the reason for the occurence of\n\u2212\nXtd\nin the PL spectrum, though it is still puzzling why its PL strength is almost equal to\nthose of the bright excitons. We think that our experimental observation, i.e., that the high\nPL intensity of the dark exciton is not of intrinsic origin, is also very important for further\ntheoretical treatments of this excitation. Furthermore, by our special sample preparation,\nwhich does not leave any GaAs bulk material in the sample, we can exclude impurity-related\n\u2212\nbulk excitons as a possible origin for the Xtd\nline. (We note that for the spectra compared\nin Fig. 4, the PL was excited by a Ti:Sapphire laser and the absorption was measured using\nwhite light, which required different aligning procedures. Therefore, we can not exclude\nslight shifts in the absolute positions of the observed lines due to sample inhomogeneities.\nThis means that stokes shifts between absorption and PL can not seriously be extracted\n4\n\n\ffrom these measurements.)\nIn conclusion, by comparing PL and absorption spectra at very low temperatures, we\n\u2212\ncould identify a dark triplet exciton Xtd\nby showing that, in spite of a relatively high PL\nintensity, its oscillator strength is very small and justifies the assignment as a dark mode.\n\u2212\nWe find that the Xtd\noccurs at filling factors \u03bd < 1/3 only and is not visible at T = 2 K.\nWe acknowledge stimulating discussions with Arkadiusz Wojs, Israel Bar-Joseph, and\nGo Yusa.
