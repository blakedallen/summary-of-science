The physical body always has the spatial dimensions, hence a mathematical point gives only an approximate description of the physical body. The mathematical notion of a trajectory does not have direct physical meaning, since it uses arbitrary\nreal numbers, i.e. infinite decimal expansions, while the observation is only possible, in the\nbest case, of rational numbers, and even them only with some error. Therefore, we suggest\na \"functional\" approach to classical mechanics, which is not starting from Newton's equation, but with the Liouville equation. This approach can help to explain the infamous time\nirreversibility problem, see, for example [2] - [8].\nThe conventional widely used concept of the microscopic state of the system at some\nmoment in time as the point in phase space, as well as the notion of trajectory and the microscopic equations of motion have no direct physical meaning, since arbitrary real numbers\nnot observable (observable physical quantities are only presented by rational numbers, cf.\nthe discussion of concepts of space and time in [9] - [14]).\nIn the functional approach [15] the physical meaning is attached not to a single trajectory\nbut only to a \"beam\" of trajectories, or the distribution function on phase space. Individual\ntrajectories are not observable, they could be considered as \"hidden variables\", if one uses\nthe quantum mechanical notions.\nThe fundamental equation of the microscopic dynamics of the functional probabilistic\napproach is not Newton's equation, but a Liouville equation for distribution function. It is\nwell known that the Liouville equation is used in statistical mechanics for description of the\nmotions of gas. Let us stress that we shall use the Liouville equation even for description of\na single particle in the empty space.\nThere are many discussions of the time irreversibility problem, i.e. the problem of how to\nexplain the irreversible behaviour of macroscopic systems from the time-symmetric microscopic laws. The problem has been discussed by Boltzmann, Poincar\u00e9, Bogolyubov, Feynman\nand many other authors, [2] - [8]. Landau and Lifshiz wrote about the principle of increasing entropy [4]: \"Currently it is not clear whether the law of increasing entropy can be in\nprinciple derived from classical mechanics.\" Landau speculated that to explain the second\nlaw of thermodynamics one has to use quantum mechanical measurement arguments.\nAlthough the Liouville equation is symmetric in relation to the reversion of time, but\nhis solutions have the property of delocalization, that, generally speaking, can be interpreted\nas a manifestation of irreversibility. It is understood that if at some moment in time the\ndistribution function describes a particle, localized to a certain extent, then over time the\ndegree of localization decreases, there is the spreading of distribution function. Delocalization\ntakes place even for a free particle in infinite space, where there is no ergodicity and mixing.\nIn a sense, the functional formulation of microscopic dynamics is irreversible in time. Thus\nthe contradiction between microscopic reversibility and macroscopic irreversibility of the\ndynamics disappears, since both microscopic and macroscopic dynamics in the proposed\n2\n\n\fapproach are irreversible.\nIn the functional approach to classical mechanics we do not derive the statistical or\nchaotic properties of deterministic dynamics, but we suggest that the Laplace's determinism\nat the fundamental level is absent not only in quantum, but also in classical mechanics.\nWe show that Newton's equation in the proposed approach appears as an approximate\nequation describing the dynamics of the average values of coordinates and momenta for not\ntoo long time. We calculate corrections to Newton's equation.\nAn interpretation of quantum mechanics is attempted in which both classical and quantum mechanics contain fundamental randomness. Instead of an ensemble of events one\nintroduces an ensemble of observers.\nIn the next section the fundamentals of the functional formulation of classical and quantum mechanics are presented. Section 3 deals with the free movement of particles and Newton's equation for the average coordinates. Comparison with quantum mechanics is discussed\nin Section 4. General comments on the Liouville and Newton equations are given in section\n5. Corrections to the Newton equation for a nonlinear system are calculated in Section 6.\nThe dynamics of the classical and quantum particle in a box and their interrelationships are\nsummarized in section 7.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nStates and Observables in Functional Mechanics\nClassical mechanics\n\nAn exact derivation of the coordinate and momentum can not be done, not only in quantum\nmechanics, where there is the Heisenberg uncertainty relation, but also in classical mechanics.\nAlways there are some errors in setting the coordinates and momenta. There are classical\nuncertainty relations: \u2206q > 0 and \u2206p > 0, i.e. the uncertainty (errors of observation) in the\ndetermination of coordinate and momentum is always positive (non zero). The concept of\narbitrary real numbers, given by the infinite decimal series, is a mathematical idealization,\nsuch numbers can not be measured in the experiment.\nConsider the motion of a classical particle along a straight line in the potential field. The\ngeneral case of many particles in the 3-dimensional space is discussed below. Let (q, p) be\ncoordinates on the plane R2 (phase space), t \u2208 R is time. The state of a classical particle\nat time t will be described by the function \u03c1 = \u03c1(q, p, t), it is the density of the probability\nthat the particle at time t has the coordinate q and momentum p.\nIn [16] it is given a construction of the probability density function starting from the\ndirectly observable quantities, i.e., the results of measurements, which are rational numbers.\n\n2.2\n\nClassical and quantum mechanics\n\nNote that the description of a mechanical system with the help of probability distribution\nfunction \u03c1 = \u03c1(q, p, t) does not necessarily mean that we are dealing with a set of identically\nprepared ensemble of particles. Usually in probability theory one considers an ensemble\nof events and a sample space [20]. But we can use the description with the function \u03c1 =\n\u03c1(q, p, t) also for individual bodies, such as planets in astronomy (the phase space in this case\n3\n\n\fthe 6-dimensional). In this case one can think on the \"ensemble\" of different astronomers\nwhich observe the planet. It might be that there is only one \"intelligent\" observer and an\n\"ensemble\" of different scenario of behaviour of a given object in such a way that one can\ndeal with an individual quantum phenomenon. From this point of view there is no difference\nbetween \"Einstein's moon\" and \"Heisenberg's electron\". Actually, it is implicitly always\ndealt with the function \u03c1 = \u03c1(q, p, t) which takes into account the inherent uncertainty in\nthe coordinates and momentum of the body.\nThe wave function in quantum mechanics \u03c8 = \u03c8(q, t) or the density operator actually\ndepends not only from time t and position q but also from other parameters such as the\nform of the potential field and the length of the box as well as from the mass, charge and\nthe Planck constant. Denote these parameters by \u03be. Some of these parameters can be called\nthe \"contextual\" variables. We have the wave function \u03c8 = \u03c8(q, t; \u03be). In the functional\nformulation of quantum mechanics we introduce a distribution \u03c3(\u03be) which describes the\nuncertainty in the derivation of these parameters. To get observed quantities we have to\nevaluate the average value of \u03c8 or |\u03c8|2 with \u03c3(\u03be). More discussions of functional quantum\nmechanics will be presented in a separate work. Note that similar distribution \u03c3(\u03be) we have\nto introduce already in classical functional mechanics.\nThe specific type of function \u03c1 depends on the method of preparation of the state of a\nclassical particle at the initial time and the type of potential field. When \u03c1 = \u03c1(q, p, t) has\nsharp peaks at q = q0 and p = p0 , we say that the particle has the approximate values of\ncoordinate and momentum q0 and p0 .\nIn the functional approach to classical mechanics the concept of precise trajectory of\na particle is absent, the fundamental concept is a distribution function \u03c1 = \u03c1(q, p, t) and\n\u03b4-function as a distribution function is not allowed.\nWe assume that the continuously differentiable and integrable function \u03c1 = \u03c1(q, p, t)\nsatisfies the conditions:\nZ\n\u03c1 \u2265 0,\n\u03c1(q, p, t)dqdp = 1, t \u2208 R .\n(1)\nR2\n\nThe motion of particles in the functional approach is not described directly by the Newton (Hamilton) equation. Newton's equation in the functional approach is an approximate\nequation for the average coordinates of the particles, and for non-linear dynamics there are\ncorrections to the Newton equations.\nIf f = f (q, p) is a function on phase space, the average value of f at time t is given by\nthe integral\nZ\nf (t) = f (q, p)\u03c1(q, p, t)dqdp .\n(2)\nIn a sense we are dealing with a random process \u03be(t) with values in the phase space.\n\n2.3\n\nBasic equation for a single particle\n\nMotion of a point body along a straight line in the potential field will be described by the\nequation\np \u2202\u03c1 \u2202V (q) \u2202\u03c1\n\u2202\u03c1\n=\u2212\n+\n.\n(3)\n\u2202t\nm \u2202q\n\u2202q \u2202p\n4\n\n\fHere V (q) is the potential field and mass m > 0.\nEquation (3) looks like the Liouville equation which is used in statistical physics to\ndescribe a gas of particles but here we use it to describe a single particle.\nIf the distribution \u03c10 (q, p) for t = 0 is known, we can consider the Cauchy problem for\nthe equation (3):\n\u03c1|t=0 = \u03c10 (q, p) .\n(4)\nLet us discuss the case when the initial distribution has the Gaussian form:\n\u03c10 (q, p) =\n\n1 \u2212 (q\u2212q20 )2 \u2212 (p\u2212p20 )2\ne a e b .\n\u03c0ab\n\n(5)\n\nAt sufficiently small values of the parameters a > 0 and b > 0 the particle has coordinate and\nmomentum close to the q0 and p0 . For this distribution the average value of the coordinates\nand momentum are:\nZ\nZ\nq = q\u03c10 (q, p)dqdp = q0 , p = p\u03c10 (q, p)dqdp = p0 ,\n(6)\nand dispersion\n\n3\n\n1\n1\n\u2206q 2 = (q \u2212 q)2 = a2 , \u2206p2 = (p \u2212 p)2 = b2 .\n2\n2\n\n(7)\n\nFree Motion\n\nConsider first the case of the free motion of the particle when V = 0. In this case the\nequation (3) has the form\n\u2202\u03c1\np \u2202\u03c1\n=\u2212\n(8)\n\u2202t\nm \u2202q\nand the solution of the Cauchy problem is\n\u03c1(q, p, t) = \u03c10 (q \u2212\n\np\nt, p) .\nm\n\n(9)\n\nUsing expressions (5), (9),\n(q \u2212 q0 \u2212\n1\nexp{\u2212\n\u03c1(q, p, t) =\n\u03c0ab\na2\n\np 2\nt)\nm\n\n\u2212\n\n(p \u2212 p0 )2\n},\nb2\n\nwe get the time dependent distribution of coordinates:\nZ\n(q \u2212 q0 \u2212 pm0 t)2\n1\n\u03c1c (q, t) = \u03c1(q, p, t)dp = \u221a q\n},\nexp{\u2212\n2 + b2 t2 )\nb2 t2\n(a\n2\n2\nm\n\u03c0 a + m2\nwhile the distribution of momenta is\nZ\n(p\u2212p0 )2\n1\n\u03c1m (p, t) = \u03c1(q, p, t)dq = \u221a e\u2212 b2 .\n\u03c0b\n5\n\n(10)\n\n(11)\n\n(12)\n\n\fThus, for the free particle the distribution of the particle momentum with the passage of\ntime does not change, and the distribution of the coordinates change. There is, as one says\nin quantum mechanics, the spreading of the wave packet. From (11) it follows that the\ndispersion \u2206q 2 increases with time:\n1\nb2 t2\n\u2206q 2 (t) = (a2 + 2 ) .\n2\nm\n\n(13)\n\nEven if the particle was arbitrarily well localized (a2 is arbitrarily small) at t = 0, then\nat sufficiently large times t the localization of the particle becomes meaningless, there is a\ndelocalization of the particle.\nWhat role can play the Newton equation in the functional approach? The average coordinate for the free particle in the functional approach satisfies the Newton equation. Indeed,\nthe average coordinate and momentum for the free particles have the form\nZ\nZ\np0\nq(t) = q\u03c1c (q, t)dq = q0 + t , p(t) = p\u03c1m (p, t)dp = p0 .\n(14)\nm\nNote that in the functional mechanics the Newton equation for the average coordinates is\nobtained only for the free particle or for quadratic Hamiltonians with a Gaussian initial\ndistribution function. For a more general case there are corrections to Newton's equations,\nas discussed below.\n\n4\n\nComparison with Quantum Mechanics\n\nCompare the evolutions of Gaussian distribution functions in functional classical mechanics\nand in quantum mechanics for the motion of particles along a straight line. The scene of work\nfor the functional classical mechanics is L2 (R2 ) (or L1 (R2 )), and for quantum mechanics L2 (R1 ).\nThe Schrodinger equation for a free quantum particle on a line reads:\ni~\n\n\u2202\u03c8\n~2 \u2202 2 \u03c8\n=\u2212\n.\n\u2202t\n2m \u2202x2\n\n(15)\n\nHere \u03c8 = \u03c8(x, t) is the wave function and ~ is the Planck constant. The density of the\ndistribution function for the Gaussian wave function has the form\n1\n\u03c1q (x, t) = |\u03c8(x, t)|2 = \u221a q\n\u03c0 a2 +\n\n~2 t2\na2 m2\n\nexp{\u2212\n\np0 2\nt)\nm\n}.\n2\n2\n~ t\n)\n2\n2\na m\n\n(x \u2212 x0 \u2212\n(a2 +\n\n(16)\n\nWe find that the distribution functions in functional classical and in quantum mechanics\n(11) and (16) coincide, if we set\na2 b2 = ~2 .\n(17)\nIf the condition (17) is satisfied then the Wigner function W (q, p, t) for \u03c8 corresponds to the\nclassical distribution function (10) , W (q, p, t) = \u03c1(q, p, t) .\nGaussian wave functions on the line are coherent or compressed states. The compressed\nstates on the interval are considered in [17].\n6\n\n\f5\n\nLiouville Equation and the Newton Equation\n\nIn the functional classical mechanics the motion of a particle along the stright line is described\nby the Liouville equation (3). A more general Liouville equation on the manifold \u0393 with\ncoordinates x = (x1 , ..., xk ) has the form\nk\n\n\u2202\u03c1 X \u2202\n+\n(\u03c1v i ) = 0 .\ni\n\u2202t\n\u2202x\ni=1\n\n(18)\n\nHere \u03c1 = \u03c1(x, t) is the density function and v = v(x) = (v 1 , ..., v k ) - vector field on \u0393.

The characteristics equations for (22) are Hamilton's\nequations\n\u2202H\n\u2202H\n, \u1e57i = \u2212\n,\n(23)\nq \u0307i =\n\u2202pi\n\u2202qi\nwhere the Hamiltonian is\nH=\n\nX p2\ni\n+ V (q) .\n2m\ni\ni\n\n(24)\n\nEmphasize here again that the Hamilton equations (23) in the current functional approach\nto the mechanics do not describe directly the motion of particles, and they are only the\ncharacteristic equations for the Liouville equation (22) which has a physical meaning. The\nLiouville equation (22) can be written as\n\u2202\u03c1\n= {H, \u03c1} ,\n\u2202t\n\n(25)\n\nX \u2202H \u2202\u03c1\n\u2202H \u2202\u03c1\n(\n\u2212\n).\n\u2202q\n\u2202p\n\u2202p\n\u2202q\ni\ni\ni\ni\ni\n\n(26)\n\nwhere the Poisson bracket\n{H, \u03c1} =\n\n7\n\n\f6\n\nCorrections to Newton's Equations\n\nIn section 3, it was noted that for the free particle in the functional approach to classical\nmechanics the averages coordinates and momenta satisfy the Newton equations. However,\nwhen there is a nonlinear interaction, then in functional approach corrections to the Newton's\nequations appear.\nConsider the motion of a particle along the line in the functional mechanics. Average\nvalue f of the function on the phase space f = f (q, p) at time t is given by the integral (2)\nZ\nf (t) =< f (t) >= f (q, p)\u03c1(q, p, t)dqdp .\n(27)\nHere \u03c1(q, p, t) has the form (20)\n\u03c1(q, p, t) = \u03c10 (\u03c6\u2212t (q, p)) .\n\n(28)\n\nBy making the replacement of variables, subject to the invariance of the Liouville measure,\nwe get\nZ\nZ\n< f (t) >= f (q, p)\u03c1(q, p, t)dqdp = f (\u03c6t (q, p))\u03c10 (q, p)dqdp .\n(29)\nLet us take\n\u03c10 (q, p) = \u03b4\u01eb (q \u2212 q0 )\u03b4\u01eb (p \u2212 p0 ) ,\n\n(30)\n\n1\n2 2\n\u03b4\u01eb (q) = \u221a e\u2212q /\u01eb ,\n\u03c0\u01eb\n\n(31)\n\nwhere\n\nq \u2208 R, \u01eb > 0.\nLet us show that in the limit \u01eb \u2192 0 we obtain the Newton (Hamilton) equations:\nlim < f (t) >= f (\u03c6t (q0 , p0 )) .\n\u01eb\u21920\n\n(32)\n\nProposition 1. Let the function f (q, p) in the expression (27) be continous and integrable, and \u03c10 has the form (30). Then\nZ\nlim f (q, p)\u03c1(q, p, t)dqdp = f (\u03c6t (q0 , p0 )) .\n(33)\n\u01eb\u21920\n\n\u2032\n\nProof. Functions \u03b4\u01eb (q) form a \u03b4-sequence in D (R) [18]. Hence we obtain\nZ\nZ\nlim f ((q, p))\u03c1(q, p, t)dqdp = lim f (\u03c6t (q, p))\u03b4\u01eb (q \u2212 q0 )\u03b4\u01eb (p \u2212 p0 ) = f (\u03c6t (q0 , p0 )) , (34)\n\u01eb\u21920\n\n\u01eb\u21920\n\nthat was required to prove.\nNow calculate the corrections to the solution of the equation of Newton. In functional\nmechanics consider the equation, see (3) ,\n\u2202\u03c1\n\u2202\u03c1\n\u2202\u03c1\n= \u2212p\n+ \u03bbq 2 .\n\u2202t\n\u2202q\n\u2202p\n8\n\n(35)\n\n\fHere \u03bb is a small parameter and we set the mass m = 1. The characteristic equations have\nthe form of the following Hamilton (Newton) equations:\n\u1e57(t) + \u03bbq(t)2 = 0 , q\u0307(t) = p(t) .\n\n(36)\n\nSolution of these equations with the initial data q(0) = q, q\u0307(0) = p for small t has the form\n\u03bb\n(q(t), p(t)) = \u03c6t (q, p) = (q + pt \u2212 q 2 t2 + ..., p \u2212 \u03bbq 2 t + ...)\n2\n\n(37)\n\n\u2032\n\nUse the asymptotic expansion \u03b4\u01eb (q) in D (R) for \u01eb \u2192 0, compare [7, 19]:\n\u03b4\u01eb (q) = \u03b4(q) +\n\n\u01eb2 \u2032\u2032\n\u03b4 (q) + ... ,\n4\n\nthen for \u01eb \u2192 0 we obtain corrections to the Newton dynamics:\nZ\n\u01eb2 \u2032\u2032\n\u03bb 22\n< q(t) >= (q + pt \u2212 q t + ...)[\u03b4(q \u2212 q0 ) + \u03b4 (q \u2212 q0 ) + ...]\n2\n4\n\n(38)\n\n(39)\n\n\u01eb2 \u2032\u2032\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\n\u03b4 (p \u2212 p0 ) + ...]dqdp = q0 + p0 t \u2212 q02 t2 \u2212 \u01eb2 t2 .\n4\n2\n4\nDenoting the Newton solution\n*[\u03b4(p \u2212 p0 ) +\n\n\u03bb\nqNewton (t) = q0 + p0 t \u2212 q02 t2 ,\n2\nwe obtain for small \u01eb, t and \u03bb:\n\u03bb\n< q(t) >= qNewton (t) \u2212 \u01eb2 t2 .\n4\n\n(40)\n\nHere \u2212 \u03bb4 \u01eb2 t2 is the correction to the Newton solution received within the functional\napproach to classical mechanics with the initial Gaussian distribution function. If we choose\na different initial distribution we get correction of another form.\nWe have proved\nProposition 2. In the functional approach to mechanics the first correction at \u01eb to the\nNewton dynamics for small t and \u03bb for equation (36) has the form (40).\nNote that in the functional approach to mechanics instead of the usual Newton equation\nd2\nq(t) = F (q) ,\ndt2\n\n(41)\n\nd2\n< q(t) >=< F (q)(t) > .\ndt2\n\n(42)\n\nm\nwhere F (q) is a force, we obtain\nm\n\nThe task of calculating the corrections at \u01eb for Newton's equation for mean values is similar\nto the problem of calculating semiclassical corrections in quantum mechanics.\n9\n\n\f7\n\nDynamics of a Particle in a Box\n\nDynamics of collisionless continuous medium in a box with reflecting walls is considered by\nPoincare and in [8]. This studied asymptotics of solutions of Liouville equation. In functional\napproach to mechanics, we interpret the solution of the Liouville equation as described the\ndynamics of a single particle. Here we consider this model in the classical and also in the\nquantum version for the special case of Gaussian initial data. In particular we obtain that\na single free particle in the box behaves like a gas with the Maxwell type distribution.\n\n7.1\n\nDynamics of a classical particle in a box\n\nConsider the motion of a free particle on the interval with the reflective ends. Using the\nmethod of reflections [18], the solution of the Liouville equation (8)\n\u2202\u03c1\np \u2202\u03c1\n=\u2212\n\u2202t\nm \u2202q\non the interval 0 \u2264 q \u2264 1 with the reflective ends we write as\n\u03c1(q, p, t) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n[\u03c10 (q \u2212\n\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\np\np\nt + 2n, p) + \u03c10 (\u2212q + t + 2n, \u2212p)] ,\nm\nm\n\n(43)\n\nwhere it is assumed that the function \u03c10 has the Gaussian form (5). R\nOne can show that for the distribution for coordinates \u03c1c (q, t) = \u03c1(q, p, t)dp one gets\nthe uniform limiting distribution (pointwise limit): limt\u2192\u221e \u03c1c (q, t) = 1 . For the distribution\nof the absolute values of momenta (p > 0) \u03c1a (p, t) = \u03c1m (p, t) + \u03c1m (\u2212p, t) , where\nZ 1\n\u03c1m (p, t) =\n\u03c1(q, p, t)dq ,\n0\n\nas t \u2192 \u221e we get the distribution of the Maxwell type (but not the Maxwell distribution):\n(p+p0 )2\n(p\u2212p0 )2\n1\nlim \u03c1a (p, t) = \u221a [e\u2212 b2 + e\u2212 b2 ] .\nt\u2192\u221e\n\u03c0b\n\n7.2\n\nDynamics of a quantum particle in a box\n\nThe Schrodinger equation for free quantum particle on the interval 0 \u2264 x \u2264 1 with reflecting\nends has the form\n\u2202\u03c6\n~2 \u2202 2 \u03c6\ni~\n=\u2212\n(44)\n\u2202t\n2m \u2202x2\nwith the boundary conditions \u03c6(0, t) = 0, \u03c6(1, t) = 0, t \u2208 R . Solution of this boundary\nproblem can be written as follows:\n\u03c6(x, t) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n[\u03c8(x + 2n, t) \u2212 \u03c8(\u2212x + 2n, t)] ,\n\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\n10\n\n\fwhere \u03c8(x, t) is some solution of the Schrodinger equation. To get an observable quantity\nwe have to compute the average value with the distribution \u03c3(\u03be) (see Sect.2). Such average\nvalues will demonstrate an irreversible behaviour for large time. If we choose the function \u03c8(x, t) in the form, corresponding to the distribution (16), then one can show that in\nthe semiclassical limit for the probability density |\u03c6(x, t)|2 the leading term is the classical\ndistribution \u03c1c (x, t).\n\n8\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this paper the functional formulation of classical mechanics is considered which is based\nnot on the notion of an individual trajectory of the particle but on the distribution function\non the phase space.\nThe fundamental equation of the microscopic dynamics in the functional approach is\nnot the Newton equation but the Liouville equation for the distribution function of a single\nparticle. Solutions of the Liouville equation have the property of delocalization which accounts for irreversibility. It is shown that the Newton equation in this approach appears as\nan approximate equation describing the dynamics of the average values of the positions and\nmomenta for not too long time intervals. Corrections to the Newton equation are computed.\nIf we accept the functional approach to classical mechanics then both classical and quantum mechanics contain fundamental randomness. It requires a reconsideration of the usual\ninterpretation(s) of quantum mechanics. Some remarks on these questions we made in Sect.2.\nInteresting problems related with applications of the functional mechanics to statistical mechanics, field theory, singularities in cosmology and black holes we hope to consider in further\nworks.\n\n9\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nI am grateful to many colleagues for valuable discussions.
