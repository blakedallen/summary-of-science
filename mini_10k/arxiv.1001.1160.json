INTRODUCTION\n\nIn recent years, a large number of dwarf spheroidal\nsatellite galaxies of the Milky Way have been discovered\nusing the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (Willman et al. 2005,\nZucker et al. 2006). These galaxies are much fainter than\npreviously known Milky Way satellites, having larger\nmass-to-light ratios and velocity dispersions that range\nfrom 7.6 km/s down to 3.3 km/s (Simon & Geha 2007).\nEstimating the amount of dark matter contained in these\ngalaxies becomes more susceptible to error than in the\nlarger dwarf spheroidals. This is not only because of the\nstatistical error associated with small stellar samples, but\nalso because sources of velocity contamination constitute\na larger fractional error due to the galaxy's small intrinsic velocity dispersion. Potential sources of contamination come from foreground Milky Way stars, atmospheric\njitter in red giant stars (Pryor et al. 1988), and an inflated velocity dispersion due to the orbital motion of\nbinary stars (Olszewski et al. 1996). Among these, binaries have been the most difficult to correct for because the\nbinary distribution of velocities in environments beyond\nthe solar neighborhood is not well known and difficult to\nconstrain without a large number of high-precision radial\nvelocity measurements.\nThe most prominent signature of binary stars in these\ngalaxies is a high-velocity \"tail\" in the velocity distribution due to short-period binaries, which gives the distribution a higher kurtosis than that expected from a Gaussian. Because of this departure from Gaussianity, the\nintrinsic velocity dispersion is usually estimated by using a robust estimator such as the biweight (Beers et al.\n1990), by discarding velocity outlier stars from the data\nsample, or by a combination of both approaches (cf.\nMateo et al. 1991). While these techniques eliminate the\nlargest component of the binary dispersion, binaries in-\n\nflate the first-order (Gaussian) component of the dispersion as well. In previous studies, Olszewski et al. (1996)\nand Hargreaves et al. (1996) used Monte Carlo simulations to show that the dispersion estimated by these techniques is inflated due to binaries by an amount which is\nsmall compared to the statistical error in their data sets.\nSince that time, the number of stars in then-known dwarf\nspheroidals with spectroscopic data has increased considerably, from less than 100 at the time of Olszewski et al.\n(1996) to more than 1000 for Draco, Fornax, and Carina (Walker et al. 2009). For such large samples, we\nwill show that the bias in the first-order dispersion due\nto binaries is larger than the statistical error. More importantly, for galaxies whose intrinsic dispersion is small,\nthe first-order dispersion may be inflated by somewhat\nmore than the statisical error even in data sets as small\nas 100 stars.\nTo improve previous estimates of the intrinsic dispersion for these cases, it is necessary to model the velocity\ndistribution of the binary population and investigate the\nbehavior of the binary dispersion as model parameters\nsuch as binary fraction are varied. With this approach\nit is desirable to find the best possible constraints on\nthe binary velocity distribution, and observations taken\nat multiple epochs are very useful for this purpose. In\naddition, estimating the binary fraction and other binary properties in galaxies and clusters beyond the solar neighborhood is useful in its own right, since this\nhas been difficult to predict accurately in simulations\n(Tohline 2002, Goodwin et al. 2007). Binaries also affect higher-order moments of the velocity distribution,\ne.g. kurtosis, which has been shown in principle to provide useful information about the mass profile of galaxies\n(Lokas et al. 2005).\nIn section 2 we derive an analytic formula for the\n\n\f2\ncenter-of-mass velocity distribution of binary stars. In\nsection 3 we use this distribution to derive likelihoods\nfor both single- and two-epoch velocity data. We demonstrate in section 4 how properties of a binary population\ncan be constrained from multi-epoch data. Fig. 4 shows\nthat repeat measurements with a baseline of 1-2 years\nis sufficient to constrain the binary population. We will\nprove that over a range of velocities of a few km/s, the\nbinary fraction is nearly degenerate with the parameters characterizing the distribution of periods, and in section 5 we use this fact to develop a model-independent\nmethod for correcting the dispersion due to binaries by\nusing multi-epoch data. Fig. 10 encapsulates our main\nresult, from which we conclude that the velocity dispersions of dwarf spheroidals are unlikely to be inflated by\nmore than 20% by binaries. The procedure to correct\nthe dispersion for binaries is summarized at the end of\nsection 5. In section 6 we outline a method to combine\nsingle- and multi-epoch data in a Bayesian analysis, and\ndiscuss the issue of foreground contamination and how\nthis affects the apparent binary population. In section\n7 we find a fitting function for the velocity distribution\nof binary stars and use it to derive an analytic formula\nfor the binary dispersion. Finally, in section 8 we further\nexplore the degeneracy of model parameters and discuss\nprospects for constraining the period distribution of binary systems from multi-epoch velocity data.\n\nvz =\n\n1\n2\u03c0a\n(1 \u2212 e2 )\u2212 2 ge (\u03b8, \u03c8, \u03c6),\nP\n\nge (\u03b8, \u03c8, \u03c6) \u2261 sin \u03b8 [cos(\u03c8 \u2212 \u03c6) + e cos(\u03c6)]\n\n(2)\n\nwhere a is the semi-major axis of the primary star's orbit, and \u03b8 and \u03c8 are the second and third Euler angles,\nrespectively. The azimuthal Euler angle does not appear\nexplicitly because vz is invariant under rotations about\nthe z-axis.\nNow taking the log of eq. 1 and subsituting Kepler's\nthird law, we find\nlog P = k \u2212 3 log |vz |,\nk \u2261 log\n\n(\u0012\n\n|ge (\u03b8, \u03c8, \u03c6)|\n\u221a\n1 \u2212 e2\n\n\u00133\n\n(2\u03c0q)3 m\n(1 + q)2\n\n(3)\n)\n\n(4)\n\nwhere P is in years, m is the mass of the primary star in\nsolar masses, q is the ratio of secondary-to-primary mass,\nand vz is in units of AU/year.\nAs an aside, we note that eqs. 3 and 4 can be used\nto make a back-of-the-envelope estimate of the velocity\nscale associated with a given orbital period. By averaging over orientations, mass ratio and eccentricity (whose\nPDF's are given below), we find\n\n2. DISTRIBUTION OF VELOCITIES IN THE\nCENTER-OF-MASS FRAME OF BINARY SYSTEMS\n\nSpectroscopic velocity measurements of binary stars\nare typically dominated by the primary star due to\nthe difference in luminosities and spectra between the\ntwo stars. This is especially true for stars that lie\non the red giant branch, for which the luminositymass relation steepens drastically. By way of comparison, Duquennoy & Mayor (1991) found the ratio of\nsecondary-to-primary masses of binary stars within the\nsolar neighborhood to peak at m/M \u2248 0.23 with only\n\u2248 20% of the stars having mass ratios larger than 0.6.\nFor systems with a mass ratio of 0.6 and the primary lying near the base of the red giant branch, the luminosity\nratio would be at most l \u2248 (m/M )2.3 \u2248 0.3; this ratio becomes much smaller if the primary star is further along on\nthe red giant branch. Thus, although the cross correlation function of the stellar spectra may be double-peaked\n(Tonry & Davis 1979), the spectrum of the primary star\nwill likely dominate the signal unless the mass ratio is\nclose to 1, in which case the velocities of the two stars\nwill be nearly equal. In view of the preceding arguments,\nfor the remainder of this paper we will use the velocity of\nthe primary star in modeling the spectroscopic velocities\nof binary systems.\nTo model the velocity distribution of the primary star\nin a population of binary systems, first we must find its\nvelocity distribution in the center-of-mass frame of the\nbinary. The motion of two stars orbiting each other can\nbe simply expressed in terms of four parameters: the\nsemi-major axis a, eccentricity e, period P , and orbital\nangle \u03c6 with respect to the center of mass. If we also\nspecify the orientation of the orbital plane in terms of\nEuler angles, with the z-axis pointing along the line of\nsight, the line-of-sight velocity of the primary star in the\ncenter-of-mass frame is given by\n\n(1)\n\n|vz | \u2248 (5.7 km/s)\n\n\u0012\n\nM/M\u2299\nP/year\n\n\u0013 31\n\n(5)\n\nwhere M is the mass of the primary star. In dwarf\nspheroidal galaxies and globular clusters where red giants\nhave masses M \u2248 0.8M\u2299, the above estimate shows that\nperiods longer than a few decades will yield velocities less\nthan 2 km/s. Meanwhile, velocities larger than 10 km/s\nwill be dominated by binaries with periods shorter than\n1 month. The above estimate is somewhat sensitive to\nthe mass ratio; whereas we used the approximate mean\nvalue q \u2248 0.4 in deriving eq. 5, if a system has a mass\nratio q \u2248 0.8, the coefficient in front becomes \u2248 10 km/s.\nTo find a distribution in the center-of-mass velocity\nvz , the distribution of orbital periods must be averaged\nover all the parameters in eq. 4. We must also average\nover the time taken to traverse one orbital cycle, with\nall times being weighted equally. We express the orbital\nangle \u03c6 in terms of the eccentric anomaly parameter \u03b7,\nso that a uniform distribution in time corresponds to a\ndistribution f (\u03b7) = (1 \u2212 e cos \u03b7)/2\u03c0.\nThe orbital periods of G-dwarf stars in the solar neighborhood were found by Duquennoy & Mayor (1991) to\nfollow a log-normal distribution with a mean period of\n180 years. Fischer & Marcy (1992) also found a lognormal period distribution for M-dwarfs in the solar\nneighborhood with a mean period similar to that of the\nG-dwarfs. In terms of logarithm of the period P , the\ndistribution found by Duquennoy & Mayor (1991) has\nmean \u03bclog P = 2.23 and dispersion \u03c3log P = 2.3 (where P\nis in years, and the logarithm is base 10). We shall use\nthis as the fiducial binary model in this paper, but will\nalso allow \u03bclog P and \u03c3log P to take on other values.\nAs with the period distribution, we use distributions of\nthe mass ratio q and eccentricity e observed in G-dwarf\n\n\f3\nstars in the solar neighborhood (Duquennoy & Mayor\n1991). When comparing different empirically derived\nmass functions, Duquennoy & Mayor (1991) showed the\ndistribution of mass ratios q was best fit by the Gaussian mass function considered in Kroupa et al. (1990)\nwith mean q\u0304 = 0.23 and dispersion \u03c3q = 0.32. This\nis somewhat misleading, since for q > 0.5 the distribution is in fact consistent with the power-law initial mass\nfunctions of Salpeter and Kroupa (Salpeter 1955, Kroupa\n2001). At smaller mass ratios the distribution decreases\nsharply compared to the well-established Kroupa initial\nmass function of single stars, which implies that small\nmass ratios are strongly affected by interaction between\nprimary and secondary during the formation of the binary system.\nTo further complicate matters, Mazeh et al. (1992)\nfound that short-period binaries tend to have higher mass\nratios than those found by Duquennoy & Mayor (1991).\nBy analyzing spectroscopic binaries, they found that binaries with periods shorter than 3000 days have mass ratios consistent with a uniform distribution, although the\nPoisson errors in their analysis were quite large. Subsequent studies (Goldberg et al. 2003, Halbwachs et al.\n2004) have shown that the mass ratio distribution in\nshort-period binaries is bimodal (also seen in previous\nsamples; cf. Trimble 1990), with a peak at low mass\nratios similar to that of the long-period binaries but\nwith another peak near q \u2248 1. In the sample analyzed by Goldberg et al. (2003), the peak at high mass\nratios is smaller for primaries with masses larger than\n0.6 M\u2299 , but larger for halo stars. In view of lingering\nuncertainties in the nature of the mass ratio distribution, for simplicity we will adopt the Gaussian distribution from Duquennoy & Mayor (1991) for long-period\nbinaries (P > 3000 days) and a uniform distribution for\nshort-period binaries (P < 3000 days). For the distribution of the primary mass f (m) we will use the Kroupa initial mass function corrected for binaries (Kroupa 2002).\nThe distribution of eccentricities f (e| log P ) was found\nby Duquennoy & Mayor (1991) to have three different\nregimes depending on the period. For periods of 11 days\nor shorter, the orbits are circularized due to tidal forces\nand are therefore approximated to have e = 0. For periods between 11 days and 1000 days, f (e) can be approximated by a Gaussian with mean \u0113 = 0.25 and dispersion \u03c3e = 0.12. For periods longer than 1000 days,\nhigher eccentricities are more prevalent and the distribution approximately follows f (e) = 23 e1/2 . Among these,\nthe Gaussian regime (11 days < P < 1000 days) has\nthe greatest impact on the velocity distribution at velocities of order km/s. While the adopted distributions\nof mass ratios and eccentricities are undoubtedly only a\nrough approximation to the true distributions, our central results (presented in section 5) will prove to be quite\ninsensitive to the nature of the adopted distributions.\nAn important effect that must be taken into account\nis the effect of mass transfer between the stars if the primary star is a red giant whose size is larger than the\nradius of its Roche lobe (Paczy\u0144ski 1971). In such a\ncase, matter from the surface of the giant will accrete\nonto the smaller star and the separation between the\nstars will decrease. The end result is that either the\nother star will explode in a supernova Ia, or the stars will\n\neventually merge. This effect is not included in the distributions of Duquennoy & Mayor (1991) because their\nsample consisted entirely of dwarf stars. Therefore, we\nmake the approximation of excluding systems whose primary star is larger than its Roche lobe, assuming the\nbinary to be destroyed over a timescale much less than\n1 Gyr. We use an approximation to the radius rL (a, q)\nof the Roche lobe given by Eggleton (1983). While this\nradius is not exactly correct for eccentric orbits, a recent smoothed-particle hydrodynamics simulation of an\neccentric binary of mass ratio q = 0.6 by Church et al.\n(2009) found the Roche lobe radius to decrease only\nslightly with eccentricity. They also derive a fitting function for the Roche lobe radius with an eccentricity e,\ngiven by rL (e) = rL (e = 0)(1 \u2212 0.16e). We find using\nthis formula that the velocity distribution changes only\nby a small amount (less than 2% at 5 km/s) compared\nto when using the Roche lobe radius evaluated at pericenter, given by rL (e = 0) above. For the following calculations, we therefore adopt the Roche lobe evaluated\nat pericenter for an eccentric orbit.\nThe radius of each star is found by estimating its effective temperature from an isochrone of given age tg in\nthe stellar population synthesis model of Girardi et al.\n(2004). This, together with its magnitude, provides an\nestimate of the stellar radius. We denote MV (m; tg )\nand R(m; tg ) as the absolute V-band magnitude and\nradius (respectively) of a star of mass m assigned by\nan isochrone of age tg . If the star lies on the horizontal branch or asymptotic giant branch, instead of using\nits present radius (which may be small) we compare its\nRoche lobe to the largest radius previously attained by\nthe star at the end of its red giant phase.\nWe shall express our formula in terms of an absolute Vband upper magnitude limit Mlim and age tg . Assuming\nthe lower magnitude limit to be near the tip of the red\ngiant branch, we find the velocity distribution is quite\ninsensitive to the exact value of the lower magnitude limit\nbecause the suppression of binaries due to Roche lobe\noverflow dominates the high-luminosity end of the red\ngiant branch.\nAveraging over distributions for all the model parameters and dropping the z subscript for readability, we\nobtain\nfb (log |v|; Mlim , tg ) =\n(6)\nZ 1\nZ 2\u03c0\nZ 1\nZ 2\u03c0\n3\nd(cos \u03b8)\nd\u03c8\nf (e| log P )de\nf (\u03b7)d\u03b7\n8\u03c0 2 \u22121\n0\n0\n0\nZ 1\nZ \u221e\n\u00d7\nf (q| log P )dq\nf (m)dm * \u0398 [Mlim \u2212 MV (m; tg )]\n0\n0\nn\no\n\u2212[3 log |v|\u2212k+\u03bclog P ]2\nexp\n2\n2\u03c3log P\nq\n\u00d7 \u0398 [rL (a, q) \u2212 R(m; tg )]\n,\n2\n2\u03c0\u03c3log\nP\nwhere \u0398[x] is the Heaviside step function.

We use a Monte Carlo simulation to\nperform the integration over a grid of log |v| values and\ninterpolate to find fb (log |v|). In fig. 1 we plot fb (log |v|)\nfor different ages and absolute magnitude limits. This\nfigure shows that for velocities & 10 km/s, suppression of\n\n\f4\nwhere v \u2032 is the line-of-sight component of the velocity in\nthe center-of-mass frame of the binary system.

The suppression of binaries due to Roche-lobe overflow becomes important for\nvelocities & 10 km/s. Except at the turnover point v \u2248 10 km/s,\nthe distribution behaves locally as a log-normal to good approximation.\n\nbinaries due to Roche-lobe overflow becomes important.\nAsymptotically for large velocities, the velocity distribution in eq. 6 behaves as a log-normal with dispersion\nsimilar to that of the period distribution, \u03c3log P . This can\nbe seen as follows: first, at large velocities, the log-normal\nin the integrand is far from its maximum and therefore\nvaries slowly in the model parameters (eq. 4) compared\nto their respective probability distributions, provided k\nis not large and negative. Therefore as a first approximation we can apply the method of steepest descents and\nfind the resulting distribution to be\u0001 log-normal with a\nmean given by log |v\u0304| = 31 k\u0304 \u2212 \u03bclog P . However, the approximation of slowly varying log-normal is not strictly\ntrue, since k becomes large and negative if the mass ratio q and direction function ge (\u03b8, \u03c8, \u03c6) are close to zero.\nThis means that the mean k\u0304 is in fact a function of v. We\nfind, however, that locally k\u0304 is linear in log |v| to good\napproximation, with the result that the velocity distribution still behaves locally as a log-normal but with a\nsomewhat different dispersion from \u03c3log P . We will use\nthis to construct a fitting function for the binary velocity\ndistribution in section 7.\n3. VELOCITY DISTRIBUTION OF A POPULATION OF\nBINARY STARS\n\n3.1. Single- and two-epoch likelihood functions\n\nSuppose that among a population of stars, a fraction\nB of them are in binary systems. Further suppose that\nthe velocity distribution for stars not in binary systems\nis Gaussian with dispersion \u03c30 and systemic velocity v\u0304.\nThe velocity likelihood function will have the following\nform:\n2\n\n2\n\ne\u2212(v\u2212v\u0304) /2\u03c30\n+ BLb (v|\u03c30 , v\u0304)\nL(v|B, \u03c30 , v\u0304) = (1 \u2212 B) p\n2\u03c0\u03c302\n(7)\nwhere Lb (v|\u03c30 , v\u0304) is the likelihood for binary stars. To\nderive the binary likelihood, we note that the component\nof the velocity not due to the binary orbit is vnb = v \u2212 v \u2032 ,\n\n\u03c3 2 = \u03c302 + B\u03c3b2\n\n(9)\n\nwhere \u03c3 is the measured dispersion and \u03c3b is the binary\ndispersion found by taking the second moment of the binary velocity distribution fb (v) = fb (log |v|)/2|v| ln 10.\nAs in the usual case, it can be shown that given a normally distributed measurement error with dispersion \u03c3m ,\n2\none need only make the replacement \u03c302 \u2212\u2192 \u03c302 + \u03c3m\nin\nthe above formulas.\nNext, it is desirable to have a likelihood function for velocities measured at two different epochs. Since velocity\nchanges of order km/s over a timescale of years is entirely\nnegligible for nonbinary stars, the most fruitful approach\nis to use a likelihood in the difference \u2206v between the two\nvelocities. Keeping in mind the log-normal behavior of\nthe velocity distribution, we write the binary part of the\nlikelihood as gb (log |\u2206v|; \u2206t). As with the single-epoch\nvelocity distribution fb (log |v|), we use a Monte Carlo\nsimulation to calculate gb (log |\u2206v|; \u2206t). For each binary\nin the simulation we find \u2206v by evolving the orbital phase\nto its value after a time \u2206t and calculating the resulting\nchange in velocity. In the absence of measurement error,\nthe nonbinaries will have zero change in velocity, so the\ntotal likelihood can be written as\nL(\u2206v|\u2206t, B) = (1 \u2212 B)\u03b4(\u2206v) + B\n\ngb (log |\u2206v|; \u2206t)\n(10)\n2|\u2206v| ln 10\n\nIf there is a normally distributed measurement error,\nthe likelihood must be averaged over two Gaussians of\nwidths \u03c3m,1 and \u03c3m,2 for the first and second velocity\nerrors, respectively. A little calculation shows this to\nbe equivalent to averaging over a single Gaussian with\ndispersion \u03c32e , which is the equivalent 2-epoch measurement error:\n2\n2\n2\n\u03c32e\n= \u03c3m,1\n+ \u03c3m,2\n,\n\n2\n\n(11)\n2\n\ne\u2212\u2206v /2\u03c32e\nL(\u2206v|\u2206t, B, \u03c32e ) = (1 \u2212 B) p\n(12)\n2\n2\u03c0\u03c32e\nZ \u221e \u2212(\u2206v\u2212\u2206v\u2032 )2 /2\u03c32\n2e g (log |\u2206v \u2032 |; \u2206t)\ne\nb\np\nd(\u2206v \u2032 )\n+B\n\u2032 | ln 10\n2\n2|\u2206v\n2\u03c0\u03c3\n\u2212\u221e\n2e\n\nNote that the likelihood is identical in form to that\nof eqs. 7 and 8, since in both cases we are averaging the\n\n\f5\ndistribution over a Gaussian. Both the single- and multiepoch likelihoods will be put to use in later sections.\n3.2. Threshold fraction of a binary population\n\nA convenient observable quantity for characterizing a\nbinary population is the threshold fraction, defined as the\nfraction F of stars in a sample which exhibit a change\nin radial velocity greater than a threshold \u2206v after a\ntime \u2206t between measurements. For \u2206v > 1 km/s, this\nfraction is typically smaller than 0.2, so the threshold\nnumber (given by n = N F where N is the number of\nstars) follows a Poisson distribution with mean n\u0304 = N F\u0304 .\nTherefore the distribution of F is characterized by a single number, the mean threshold fraction F\u0304 , and the expected error can be p\nestimated. In particular, the error in\nF is approximately F\u0304 /N (appendix 2). For notational\nsimplicity, for the remainder of this paper we will refer\nto the mean threshold fraction F\u0304 as simply the threshold fraction F (without the bar), with the understanding\nthat the observed threshold fraction will have a Poisson\nscatter about this value.\nDespite its straightforward definition, there are two difficulties in measuring the threshold fraction from actual\ndata sets. First, often there does not exist a common\ntime interval \u2206t between measurements in the sample,\nbut rather several time intervals for various subsets of\nstars. Furthermore, different velocity measurements have\ntheir own associated measurement errors and this in turn\naffects the measured value of F . The latter issue can\nbe dealt with in an approximate way by using the median (or other robust location estimator) of the measure\u221a\nment error of the sample, in terms of which \u03c3\u03042e = \u03c3\u0304m 2\n(eq. 11). However, both problems can be surmounted\nmore rigorously by estimating the error-free threshold\nfraction F0 via a Bayesian or maximum-likelihood approach. By using the likelihood in \u2206v defined in eq. 12,\nthe threshold fraction at a particular threshold and time\ninterval can be estimated even if measurements were\ntaken at various epochs-moreover, the inferred threshold fraction F0 is free of measurement error. This method\nwill be demonstrated in section 4.\nThe threshold fraction without measurement error,\nwhich we denote by F0 , can be expressed in terms of the\nbinary two-epoch velocity distribution gb (log |\u2206v|; \u2206t)\nby taking the integral of eq. 10 with respect to |\u2206v \u2032 |\nfrom a threshold \u2206v to \u221e:\nF0 (\u2206v|\u2206t, B) = B\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2206v\n\ngb (log |\u2206v \u2032 |; \u2206t)\nd|\u2206v \u2032 |\n|\u2206v \u2032 | ln 10\n\n(13)\n\nNote that in the absence of measurement error, the\nthreshold fraction F0 scales linearly with the binary fraction B. The threshold fraction with measurement error\nis likewise obtained by taking the integral of eq. 12 from\n\u2206v to \u221e, with the result\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u2206v\nF (\u2206v|\u2206t, B, \u03c32e ) = (1 \u2212 B)erfc \u221a\n(14)\n2\u03c32e\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ \u221e\n\u2206v \u2212 \u2206v \u2032 gb (log |\u2206v \u2032 |; \u2206t)\n\u221a\nd(\u2206v \u2032 )\nerfc\n+B\n\u2032 | ln 10\n2|\u2206v\n2\u03c3\n\u2212\u221e\n2e\nwhere \u03c32e is the 2-epoch measurement error given by\n\neq. 11. Note that in the limit as \u03c32e \u2192 0, the first term\ngoes to zero while the complementary error function in\nthe integrand reduces to a step function 2\u0398(\u2206v \u2032 \u2212 \u2206v),\nso that eq. 14 reduces to eq. 13 as expected.\n4. CONSTRAINING PROPERTIES OF A BINARY\nPOPULATION BY MULTI-EPOCH OBSERVATIONS\n\nIn this section we investigate how properties of a population of binary stars affect the observed velocity distribution measured at two or more epochs. Specifically,\nwe explore how our proposed observable, the threshold\nfaction F (section 3.2), will be affected by changes in the\nunderlying binary fraction B, absolute magnitude limit,\nstellar age, size of the measurement error, and time interval between measurements. We will also demonstrate\nhow the binary fraction B can be inferred by a likelihood analysis, and show how this leads to a better determination of the threshold fraction F . We first consider binary models with our fiducial period distribution\n(inferred from the solar neighborhood) and then explore\nhow the inferred binary fraction is affected if the assumed\nperiod distribution parameters are incorrect. Unfortunately, and as we discuss more fully in the next section,\nthe effect of changing the binary fraction B on the observed binary velocities can be mimicked closely by altering the assumed distribution of orbital periods (i.e.\nchanging the parameters \u03bclog P , \u03c3log P ). While this is\nbad news for any attempt at constraining the underlying\nproperties of a galaxy's binary population in full generality, it turns out to be good news for correcting the\nobserved velocity dispersion for the effects of binary orbital motion, as we will show in section 5.\nFirst, let us make the rather optimistic assumption\nthat the distribution of binary orbital periods is approximately universal, so that it follows our fiducial choice\n\u03bclog P = 2.23, \u03c3log P = 2.3 (section 2). Before launching into the full-fledged calculation, one would like to\nestimate how well the fiducial binary fraction B can be\nconstrained for a given sample, or conversely, how many\nstars are required to constrain B by a certain amount. To\nsimplify matters, let us assume we have a data set where\nthe two epochs have the same time interval \u2206t between\nthem and the same measurement error \u03c3m . The equiv\u221a\nalent two-epoch measurement error is then \u03c32e = \u03c3m 2\n(eq. 11).\nFirst, consider the mean threshold fraction of\nthe binaries without measurement error, denoted by\nF0 (\u2206v|\u2206t, B = 1) (eq. 13). In that case the threshold\nfraction scales with the binary fraction B, i.e. is given\nby F0 (\u2206v|\u2206t, B) = BF0 (\u2206v|\u2206t, B = 1). Now consider\nthe threshold fraction without binaries, but with a measurement error\u221a \u03c3m . The two-epoch measurement error\nis then \u03c32e \u2248 2\u03c3m (eq. 11), and the threshold fraction\nF (\u2206v|\u2206t, B = 0, \u03c32e ) is given by the complementary error function (first term in eq. 14 with B = 0). In fig. 2\nwe plot the threshold fraction F0 (\u2206v|\u2206t, B) produced by\na Monte Carlo simulation with an absolute magnitude\nlimit Mlim = 1 and stellar age tg = 10 Gyr. The threshold fraction is plotted for different binary fractions, and\nwe also plot the threshold fraction from measurement\nerror with \u03c3m = 2 km/s. Near the point of intersection \u2206vtail where F0 (\u2206vtail |\u2206t, B) = F (\u2206vtail |\u2206t, B =\n0, \u03c32e ), the effect of binary stars becomes noticeable over\nthe measurement error. Since the Poisson errors are\n\n\f6\n\nFig. 2.- Threshold fraction F (\u2206v|\u2206t, B, \u03c3m ), defined as the\nfraction of stars with observed change in velocity greater than\na threshold \u2206v after a time interval \u2206t between measurements.\nThe solid curve has no binaries (B = 0) and a measurement error\n\u03c3m = 2 km/s. The other curves are plotted from a Monte Carlo\nsimulation for binary fractions B = 1 and 0.5, with \u2206t = 1 year\nand no measurement error. The stellar population has an age tg\n= 10 Gyr and the absolute magnitude limit Mlim = 1. Given a\nmeasurement error \u03c3m , the binary fraction can be constrained for\nthresholds \u2206v & \u2206vtail , where \u2206vtail is the point of intersection\nwhere F (\u2206v|\u2206t, B = 0, \u03c3m ) = F (\u2206v|\u2206t, B, \u03c3m = 0). For a given\nbinary fraction B, the total threshold fraction without measurement error is given by B \u00d7 F (\u2206v|\u2206t, B = 1, \u03c3m = 0).\n\nlarger at higher velocity thresholds, to first approximation we can say that the error-free threshold fraction F0\nis best constrained at thresholds near \u2206vtail . It follows\nthat the fiducial binary fraction will be constrained by\nthe stars with \u2206v & \u2206vtail . (For a rough\napproximation,\n\u221a\none can also use \u2206vtail \u2248 2\u03c32e \u2248 2 2\u03c3m .) A little algebra (see appendix 2) shows that to constrain the binary\nfraction to within a fractional accuracy of \u01ebb , the number\nof stars required is approximately\n\u00132\n\u0012\n1\n2B\nN (\u01ebb ) \u2248\n(15)\nF\u0304 (\u2206vtail ) \u01ebb\nIn fig. 3 we graph the approximation formula for different values of B and compare to the 95% confidence interval in the binary fraction inferred by a Bayesian analysis\nof the simulated data (described later in this section).\nAs is evident for the B = 0.7 curve, the approximation\nformula differs for high binary fractions because B > 1 is\nnot allowed in the Bayesian analysis. The approximation\nformula is discussed further in appendix 2.\nIn fig. 4 we plot the threshold fraction F\u0304 (\u2206v|\u2206t, B =\n1, \u03c32e = 0) produced by a Monte Carlo simulation with\nan absolute magnitude limit Mlim = 1 and stellar age\ntg = 10 Gyr for different time intervals \u2206t. We find that\nfor a measurement error \u03c3m = 2 km/s, the observable\nthreshold fraction steadily increases as \u2206t is increased,\nuntil roughly \u2206t = 1 year. This result depends somewhat\non the mass ratio distribution, since higher mass ratios\nresult in higher velocities for a given orbital period. If the\nmass ratio distribution in Duquennoy & Mayor (1991)\nis assumed for all periods (as opposed to the uniform\ndistribution we adopt for P < 3000 days), the observable\nthreshold fraction increases until roughly \u2206t = 2 years.\nIn any case, unless the measurement error is smaller than\n\nFig. 3.- Fractional constraint \u01ebb on the binary fraction B, defined by eq. 15. In this plot we a measurement error \u03c3m = 2.0\nkm/s. For comparison we also plot the 95% confidence interval\nobtained by a Bayesian analysis of simulated two-epoch data from\na random sample of N stars, averaged over a hundred realizations.\nA uniform prior is assumed for B.\n\nFig. 4.- Threshold fraction F (\u2206v|\u2206t, B, \u03c3m ), defined as the\nfraction of stars with observed change in velocity greater than\na threshold \u2206v after a time interval \u2206t between measurements.\nThe solid curve has no binaries (B = 0) and a measurement error\n\u03c3m = 2 km/s. The other curves are plotted from a Monte Carlo\nsimulation for different time intervals \u2206t, with no measurement\nerror and a binary fraction B = 1. The stellar population has\nan age tg = 10 Gyr and the absolute magnitude limit Mlim = 1.\nGiven a measurement error \u03c3m , the binary fraction can be constrained for thresholds \u2206v & \u2206vtail , where \u2206vtail is the point of\nintersection where F (\u2206v|\u2206t, B = 0, \u03c3m ) = F (\u2206v|\u2206t, B, \u03c3m = 0).\nFor a given binary fraction B, the total threshold fraction without\nmeasurement error is given by B \u00d7 F (\u2206v|\u2206t, B = 1, \u03c3m = 0).\n\n2 km/s, little is gained by extending the interval from 1-2\nyears to 5 or more years.\nIn fig. 5 we plot the threshold fraction for different absolute magnitude limits Mlim = 0, 3 and stellar ages tg\n= 1 Gyr and 10 Gyr. Extending the magnitude limit to\nfainter magnitudes increases the threshold fraction because there is a greater contribution from smaller stars\nwith less binary suppression due to Roche-lobe overflow.\nThe threshold fraction is also higher for a younger stellar population because of their larger mass at a given\nstage of stellar evolution, which produces higher orbital\n\n\f7\n\nFig. 5.- Threshold fraction F (\u2206v|\u2206t, B, \u03c3m ), defined as the\nfraction of stars with observed change in velocity greater than a\nthreshold \u2206v after a time interval \u2206t year between measurements.\nHere we have picked \u2206t = 1 year, binary fraction B = 1, and no\nmeasurement error (\u03c3m = 0). We plot the threshold fraction for\ndifferent absolute magnitude limits Mlim = 0, 3 and stellar ages tg\n= 1 Gyr, 10 Gyr.

The threshold fraction F (\u2206v|\u2206t) is defined as the fraction of stars with observed change in velocity greater than a threshold \u2206v after a time interval \u2206t year between measurements. Here\nwe chose a threshold \u2206v = 5 km/s and time interval \u2206t = 1 year;\nthe correct threshold fraction for this galaxy is F \u2248 0.05.

Dashed curve uses the correct model, with the same period\ndistribution parameters \u03bclog P , \u03c3log P given above. Note that the\ncorrect threshold fraction can be recovered even if the wrong model\nis assumed (in this case, the fiducial model).\n\nmeasurements taken \u2206tdata = 2 years apart, and a measurement error of 2 km/s. First we assume the fiducial\nmodel (with \u03bclog P = 2.23, \u03c3log P = 2.3, which is incorrect for this galaxy) and, assuming a uniform prior in\nthe binary fraction B, generate a posterior in the binary\nfraction. We then repeat this procedure using the correct period distribution parameters \u03bclog P , \u03c3log P in our\nmodel, whose values are given above. The resulting posteriors are plotted in fig. 6. This figure shows that the\nbinary fraction B is a highly model-dependent quantity,\nand given the unknown nature of the period distribution\nof binaries outside the solar neighborhood, the inferred\nbinary fraction must be taken with a grain of salt. However, the fiducial binary fraction can still be used as a\nrelative indicator of the fraction of observable binaries,\nas long as it is interpreted in reference to the fraction observed in a binary population following the fiducial (solar\nneighborhood) distributions of orbital parameters.\nAlthough the inferred binary fraction B is very modeldependent, this analysis is still useful in that it leads to a\nbetter determination of the threshold fraction F , which\nis more directly observable than the binary fraction. To\nsee this, we use the Monte Carlo to generate the binary\nthreshold fraction Fb of each model, for a threshold \u2206v =\n5 km/s, time interval \u2206t = 1 year, and zero measurement\nerror, i.e. \u03c32e =0 (see eq. 14). We then transform each\nposterior in fig. 6 from B to the threshold fraction F =\nBFb . The renormalized posteriors P (F ) are plotted in\nfig. 7; the correct threshold fraction for this galaxy is\nF \u2248 0.05. Note that the correct threshold fraction can\nbe recovered even if the wrong model is assumed (in this\ncase, the fiducial model).\n\n\f8\n\nFig. 8.- Posterior probability distribution for binary fraction of a\nsimulated galaxy with 500 stars and binary fraction B = 0.5. Solid\ncurve is calculated from three velocity measurements, whereas dotted curve uses only the first two velocity measurements. v1 and\nv2 were taken 1 year apart, while v2 and v3 were taken 10 years\napart.\n\nSince even the stars with velocities smaller than the\nthreshold \u2206v are used in the likelihood analysis, the error in the threshold fraction F is smaller than if F is\nmeasured directly, especially for higher velocity thresholds. The approximate error in the threshold fraction\nF estimated by this technique is derived in appendix 2\nand given by eq. 43. Furthermore, the threshold fraction\nat \u2206t = 1 year is recovered even though the data was\ntaken with a time interval of \u2206tdata = 2 years. More\ngenerally, the threshold fraction for a specific time interval can be recovered by the likelihood analysis even\nif the data is taken at various different epochs and with\ndifferent measurement errors. As we will show in section 5, the threshold fraction can be used to correct the\nmeasured velocity dispersion of a sample for the effect of\nbinary motion.\nFinally, one may naturally wonder: how much are\nthe constraints improved by including more than two\nepochs in the analysis? To address this question, we\ndo a similar calculation on simulated 3-epoch data using the Monte Carlo to generate a 3-epoch likelihood,\nL(\u2206v21 , \u2206v32 |\u2206t21 , \u2206t32 , B, \u03c33e ), where the indices refer\nto three velocity measurements v1 , v2 , and v3 , and \u03c33e\nis the 3-epoch measurement error defined analogously to\neq. 11. We generate a data sample of 500 stars from a\nsimulated galaxy with binary fraction B = 0.5 and the\nperiod distribution parameters taking their fiducial values. For comparison, we generate a posterior P (B) from\nthe two-epoch calculation which ignores v3 . The results\nare plotted in fig. 8. The velocity measurements v1 and\nv2 were taken one year apart, while v2 and v3 were taken\nten years apart. While the most probable inferred binary\nfraction Bf it did improve in this case, the 95% confidence\nlimits are only improved by \u2248 25%. The fractional improvement in the confidence limits is even less for smaller\ndata sets; this is because in a sample of a few hundred\nstars, there is significant scatter in the binary fraction,\nand the inferred binary fraction Bf it has in fact a significant probability of becoming worse when more epochs\nare added to the sample. To constrain the binary and/or\n\nthreshold fraction, we therefore find it a more profitable\nstrategy to make two-epoch measurements over a larger\nsample of stars, as opposed to adding more repeat measurements over an existing sample (assuming a similar\nnumber of overall measurements in either case).\nA possible complicating factor in the above analysis is\nthat selection criteria for making repeat measurements\ncan bias the inferred threshold fraction and binary fraction. If stars whose spectra yield multiple peaks in the\ncross correlation function are singled out for repeat measurements, the multi-epoch sample may have an inordinately high binary fraction compared to the overall stellar population. This selection bias is probably not significant in red giant stars due to the typically large difference in luminosity between primary and secondary star.\nHowever, in samples that contain a significant fraction of\nmain sequence stars the bias may be more problematic,\nalthough an upper bound on the binary dispersion can\nstill be obtained.\n5. CORRECTING THE OBSERVED VELOCITY\nDISPERSION FROM MULTI-EPOCH DATA\n\nIn the previous section we demonstrated how uncertainties in the underlying period distribution can adversely affect our ability to constrain the underlying binary fraction from multi-epoch data. Here we demonstrate that if our goal is to correct the observed velocity\ndispersion for the effects of binary stars, the degeneracy\nbetween the period distribution parameters and binary\nfraction is quite useful: regardless of the precise nature of\nthe binary population, its effect on the observable threshold fraction F can be directly related to the associated\ncorrection in the observed velocity dispersion in a modelindependent way.\nThe important degeneracy arises from the log-normal\nbehavior of the binary velocity distribution fb (log |v|)\n(eq. 6). Binary orbital motion along the line of sight of\norder km/s is the most important for the intrinsic dispersions we are interested in. For these velocities, the value\nof log |v| is far from the mean of the log-normal, which is\napproximately \u22121 for a magnitude limit Mlim = 1 and\nage tg = 10 Gyr. The exponent of the log-normal is approximately linear over the scale of km/s, so we can write\nit as \u2212\u03b2 \u2212\u03b1 ln |v|. Therefore the binary part of the velocity distribution can be written as f (v) \u221d Be\u2212\u03b2 |v|\u22121\u2212\u03b1 ,\nwhere B is the binary fraction. If the mean binary period \u03bclog P is varied, the log-normal is offset in log-space\nso to good approximation only \u03b2 changes; therefore the\nvelocity distribution f (v) changes by a constant factor\nover the scale of km/s. If the dispersion of the period\ndistribution \u03c3log P is varied, both the offset \u03b2 and the\nslope \u03b1 change; however, the slope changes by a relatively small amount for \u03c3log P ranging from 1-3 (its viable\nrange of values; see section 8), so again the velocity distribution changes by an approximately constant factor.\nThe important point is if that the parameters \u03c3log P and\n\u03bclog P are varied, they change the velocity distribution\nby an amount which is nearly the same over the scale\nof several km/s-in other words, they behave similarly\nas if the binary fraction were changed. This is also true\nof the magnitude limit and stellar age, which effectively\nchange the mean of the log-normal and therefore behave\nsimilarly to \u03bclog P . We therefore conclude that the parameters \u03bclog P , \u03c3log P , magnitude limit Mlim and stellar\n\n\f9\nage tg are all nearly degenerate with binary fraction over\nthe scale of km/s.\nThe degeneracy of the period distribution parameters\nwith binary fraction also holds for the two-epoch velocity\ndistribution gb (log |\u2206v|; \u2206t), since this also has a lognormal form for km/s velocities. By eq. 14, therefore, the\nsame degeneracy holds for the threshold fraction F . The\neffect of this degeneracy on the threshold fraction and\nits implications for constraining the binary distribution\nof periods will be explored in further detail in section 8.\nIn this section we will consider the threshold fraction\nF0 with a fixed time interval of 1 year and without measurement error, i.e. F0 = F (\u2206v|\u2206t =1 year, \u03c32e = 0)\n(section 3.2). There is no loss of generality in this; as\nwe demonstrated in section 4, the threshold fraction for\nany given time interval \u2206t can be estimated by a likelihood analysis even if measurements are taken at various\ndifferent epochs and with various different measurement\nerrors. However, if the threshold fraction F is measured\ndirectly for a fixed time interval, it is necessary to account for the effect of measurement error on F ; we will\naddress this later in the section.\nIn the absence of measurement error, by definition\nF0 scales linearly with the binary fraction B (eq. 13).\nFurthermore, because of the near-degeneracy of the period distribution parameters with binary fraction, F0 also\nscales linearly with \u03bclog P and \u03c3log P to good approximation over their viable range of values (roughly 1-3 with\nP in years; see section 8). The essential point is that a\nsimilar relationship holds for the velocity dispersion if a\nhigh-velocity cutoff is used, e.g. at vc = 3\u03c3, since the\ndegeneracy approximately holds for velocities v < vc . It\nfollows that if velocity outlier stars are excluded in determining velocity dispersion, the extra dispersion due to\nbinaries can be determined from the threshold fraction\nF0 with reasonable confidence even if the parameters B,\n\u03bclog P , and \u03c3log P are entirely unknown.\nWe demonstrate this by simulating galaxies with various intrinsic dispersions and characterized by different\nbinary populations. The dispersion \u03c3 is calculated by iteratively discarding stars with velocities larger than 3\u03c3;\non the first iteration the biweight is used to estimate\nthe dispersion, and the dispersion is then calculated on\nevery subsequent iteration until all the remaining stars\nhave velocities that lie within 3\u03c3. In order to make the\nstatistical error negligible, we used a very large \"sample\"\nof 100,000 stars. We also calculate the threshold fraction\nF0 for the same data set, for which we picked a threshold\n\u2206v = 5 km/s and time interval \u2206t = 1 year.\nFirst, we assume the fiducial binary period distribution (\u03bclog P and \u03c3log P ) and vary the binary fraction from\nB = 0.1 to 1. In fig. 9 we plot the ratio \u03c3/\u03c30 of measured\ndispersion over the intrinsic dispersion as a function of\nthreshold fraction, for galaxies with intrinsic dispersions\nof 4, 7, and 10 km/s. We used an absolute magnitude\nlimit Mlim = 3, however the graph remains virtually unchanged for other magnitude limits because of the neardegeneracy of magnitude limit with binary fraction discussed at the beginning of this section. We see that for\na given intrinsic dispersion, the observed threshold fraction can be mapped in a one-to-one way to the intrinsic\ndispersion. The relation shown in the graph also holds\nregardless of the age of the stellar population, again because of the degeneracy of age with binary fraction.\n\nFig. 9.- Ratio of measured velocity dispersion \u03c3 over the intrinsic dispersion \u03c30 , plotted with respect to threshold fraction F0 for\ndifferent binary fractions in galaxies of intrinsic dispersions \u03c30 = 5,\n7, and 10 km/s. The measured dispersions were calculated by an interative 3\u03c3-clipping routine, and the threshold fraction F0 denotes\nthe fraction of stars with observed change in velocity greater than\na threshold \u2206v = 5 km/s after a time \u2206t = 1 year between measurements, assuming zero measurement error. The fiducial period\ndistribution (\u03bclog P = 2.23, \u03c3log P = 2.3, P in years) is assumed,\nand the binary fraction is varied between 0.1 and 1.\n\nNext we repeat the procedure over a grid of values for\nthe parameters B, \u03bclog P , and \u03c3log P , and for each point\nwe plot the ratio \u03c3/\u03c30 with respect to the threshold fraction F0 . The results are plotted in fig. 10, again for galaxies with intrinsic dispersions of 4, 7, and 10 km/s. We\nsee that for each group, the graph forms a tight relation\nfor all but the most extreme values of the period distribution parameters. In plotting these points we varied B\nfrom 0.2 to 1, \u03bclog P from -1 to 4, and \u03c3log P from 0.5 to\n4 (with P in years). The lowermost points of each group\nare the points for with \u03c3log P has its smallest value of\n0.5, producing only a very small number of short-period\nbinaries. The uppermost points are the points for which\n\u03bclog P has its smallest value, so the period distribution is\nshifted toward short periods. For these extreme values,\nthe velocity distribution becomes distorted into a distinctly non-Gaussian shape so these can be considered\nhighly improbable configurations. We have also varied\nthe ellipticity distribution parameters \u0113, \u03c3e (section 2)\nand find that the tight correlation in fig. 10 is unchanged,\nand although the amount of scatter increases slightly, the\ncorrection still holds to within a few percent accuracy.\nWe find that the points plotted in fig. 10 are well fit by\na line plus an exponential function, provided that outlier\npoints are discarded. To define \"outliers\", first we divide the domain F0 \u2208 [0, 0.2] into sections small enough\nso the graph is approximately linear within each section.\nWe then further divide each section into two subsections\nand calculate the median and median absolute deviation\n(MAD) of the y-values of the points in each subsection.\nNext we draw lines through the two points defined by\nthe median \u00b1 twice the MAD of each of the two subsections, taking the center of the subsection as their x-value.\nThe plotted points that lie outside the region defined by\nthese lines represent extreme and highly improbable period distributions, and are therefore discarded. We fit the\nremaining points and repeat the procedure for galaxies\n\n\f10\n\nFig. 10.- Ratio of measured velocity dispersion \u03c3 over the intrinsic dispersion \u03c30 , plotted with respect to threshold fraction F0\nfor different binary populations in galaxies of intrinsic dispersions\n\u03c30 = 5, 7, and 10 km/s. The measured dispersions were calculated\nby an interative 3\u03c3-clipping routine, and the threshold fraction\nF0 denotes the fraction of stars with observed change in velocity\ngreater than a threshold \u2206v = 5 km/s after a time \u2206t = 1 year\nbetween measurements, assuming zero measurement error. Each\npoint represents a different binary population with its own binary\nfraction and period distribution; we plotted the points over a grid\nof values, with binary fraction B ranging from 0.2 to 1, \u03bclog P\nfrom -1 to 4 (in log(P /year)) and \u03c3log P from 0.5 to 4. We show\nat the end of section 5 how F0 can be inferred from observations\naccounting for measurement errors.\n\nof dispersions ranging from 3-12 km/s.\nThe plots in fig. 10 are not directly applicable to real\ndata because each graph was plotted for a fixed intrinsic\ndispersion \u03c30 , which is unknown (and is in fact what we\nare attempting to calculate!). We therefore use our fits\ntogether with a root-finding procedure, interpolating the\nfitting parameters in \u03c30 , to draw similar graphs at fixed\nvalues of \u03c3. A few resulting curves are plotted in fig. 11.\nAgain, we find these curves are well fit by a line plus\nexponential,\nh\ni\n\u03c3\n= a(\u03c3) + b(\u03c3)F0 + c(\u03c3) eF0 /0.1 \u2212 1\n\u03c30\n\na(\u03c3) = 0.988e\u22120.0007\u2206\u03c3\nc(\u03c3) = 0.043e\u22120.247\u2206\u03c3\n\nthe value of F0 in eq. 16 must be scaled by the ratio\nF0 (\u2206v)/F0 (5 km/s). This ratio can be calculated by using Monte Carlo realizations to plot the threshold fraction as a function of threshold, which we will do in section\n4 (figs. 2, 4). Again, the degeneracy of magnitude limit\nand period distribution parameters with binary fraction\nensures that this ratio is virtually independent of the\nmodel parameters and magnitude limit, provided one\ndoes not transform to thresholds that are too high (>\n10 km/s). We find that for thresholds in the range 4\nkm/s < \u2206v < 10 km/s, the ratio F0 (\u2206v)/F0 (5 km/s)\ncan be fit by the function\nF0 (\u2206v)\n= a + be\u2212\u2206v/\u2206vs\nF0 (5 km/s)\n\n(16)\n\nwhere F0 is the threshold fraction at 5 km/s. We also\nfind fitting functions for the parameters a(\u03c3), b(\u03c3), and\nc(\u03c3) which fit well for dispersions \u03c3 ranging from 4 km/s\nto 10 km/s. Defining \u2206\u03c3 = \u03c3 \u2212 4 km/s, we find:\nb(\u03c3) = 0.576 \u2212 0.08\u2206\u03c3 + 0.772 1 \u2212 e\u22120.1\u2206\u03c3\n\nFig. 11.- Ratio of measured velocity dispersion \u03c3 over the intrinsic dispersion \u03c30 , plotted with respect to threshold fraction F0\nfor fixed measured dispersions \u03c3. These curves were found by fitting graphs like those shown in fig. 10, then transforming to fixed\nvalues of the measured dispersion \u03c3. The measured dispersions in\nfig. 10 were calculated by an interative 3\u03c3-clipping routine, and\nthe threshold fraction F0 denotes the fraction of stars with change\nin velocity greater than a threshold \u2206v = 5 km/s after a time\n\u2206t = 1 year between measurements, with zero measurement error. We show at the end of section 5 how F0 can be inferred from\nobservations accounting for measurement errors.\n\n(17)\n\u0001\n\n(18)\n(19)\n\nThese formulas hold for any magnitude limit and stellar age, and the threshold fraction F0 refers here to a\nvelocity threshold of 5 km/s, time interval of 1 year, and\nzero measurement error.\nHow are these formulas adjusted if a different velocity threshold is desired? Ideally, one should use the\nsmallest possible threshold that is not significantly affected by measurement error\u2013this will include the most\nstars and therefore have a smaller scatter compared to\nhigher thresholds. To use a different threshold \u2206v,\n\n(20)\n\nwhere the best-fit parameters are a = 0.0725, b = 1.897,\nand \u2206vs = 6.947 km/s. Thus to find the correction to\nthe dispersion in terms of a given velocity threshold \u2206v,\none substitutes eq. 20 into eq. 16 so that the fit is in\nterms of F0 (\u2206v).\nThe sampling error in the intrinsic dispersion \u03c30 determined by this procedure can be estimated by noting that\nfor a two-epoch sample of N2e p\nstars, the Poisson error in\nthe threshold fraction is \u03b4F \u2248 F0 (\u2206v)/N2e . Let us assume the dispersion is measured in a larger single-epoch\nsample of N stars; then we can make the approximation\nthat the sampling errors in \u03c3 and F are weakly correlated\nso they add in quadrature. Propagating the error using\neq. 16 gives the sampling error in the intrinsic dispersion,\n\u0012\n\n\u03b4\u03c30\n\u03c30\n\n\u00132\n\n2\n\n\u2248\n\n\u03c30 \u2202 (\u03c3/\u03c30 )\n(\u03c3/\u03c30 )\n+\n2N\n\u03c3 \u2202F0\n\n2\n\nF0 (\u2206v)\nN2e\n\n(21)\n\nwhere the second term in eq. 21 is the two-epoch sampling error. For example, if the single-epoch sample con-\n\n\f11\ntains N = 500 stars and the measured threshold fraction\nis F0 = 0.1 in a two-epoch subset of N2e = 100 stars,\nthe intrinsic dispersion \u03c30 can be determined to within\n\u2248 5% for dispersions \u03c3 > 4 km/s. Eq. 21 was tested\nwith Monte Carlo simulations and found to be accurate\nto within \u2248 0.8% for N = N2e ; in the above example,\nthe formula is accurate to within \u2248 0.5%. However, the\nfractional error in \u03c30 cannot be made smaller than \u2248\n0.5% because of the inherent uncertainty in the binary\npopulation model represented by the width of the plots\nin fig. 10. We find that for an observed threshold fraction F = 0.1, the two-epoch sampling error is smaller\nthan the single-epoch error unless N/N2e > 5. Given a\nmeasured threshold fraction F (\u2206v), the two-epoch sampling error is larger relative to the single-epoch error for\nsmaller measured dispersions.\nFinally, we address the issue of measurement error.\nAs mentioned above, the best approach is to estimate\nthe error-free threshold fraction F0 by a Bayesian or\nmaximum-likelihood approach (see section 4), in which\ncase measurement error need not be considered here.\nHowever, if F is calculated directly from the data, then\nmeasurement error must be considered in the above formulas. We find that given a 2-epoch measurement error \u03c32e (eq. 11), the threshold fraction F (\u2206v|\u03c32e ) is related to the threshold fraction without measurement error F0 (\u2206v) by a linear transformation-yet another consequence of the degeneracy between binary fraction and\nthe period distribution parameters (see appendix 1 for a\nderivation of this result). The transformation takes the\nform:\n\u0015\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2206v\n\u2206v\n+\u03b2\nF0 (\u2206v)\nF (\u2206v|\u03c32e ) \u2248 erfc \u221a\n\u03c32e\n2\u03c32e\n\u0014\n\n(22)\n\nThis result (together with eq. 20) has been tested by\nusing the Monte Carlo simulation to produce plots similar to fig. 10 for different velocity thresholds and measurement errors. The approximate analytic form of \u03b2\ncan also be derived (see appendix 1); using this together\nwith the Monte Carlo plots to map \u03b2, we find that \u03b2 is\nwell fit by the following function (appendix 1):\n\nby measurement\n\u221a error; this is approximately \u2206v \u2248 2\u03c3\u03042e\nwhere \u03c3\u03042e = 2\u03c3\u0304m is the median two-epoch measurement error. An alternative (and more rigorous) approach is to estimate the measurement error-free threshold fraction F0 by a likelihood analysis. This procedure\nis demonstrated in section 4.\n2. Measure the velocity dispersion \u03c3meas of the sample\nby an iterative 3\u03c3-clipping routine. Correct the dispersion for measurement error to find the error-free dispersion \u03c3.\n3. If the chosen velocity threshold is different from 5\nkm/s, scale the threshold fraction F0 (5 km/s) in eq. 16\naccording to eq. 20.\n4. If the threshold fraction is measured directly, one\nmust use eq. 22 to relate the error-free threshold fraction\nF0 (\u2206v) in eq. 16 to the threshold fraction with measurement error, F (\u2206v|\u03c32e ).\n5. After substituting F0 (5 km/s) in terms of F (\u2206v|\u03c32e )\n(given by steps 3 and 4 above) into eq. 16, use eq. 16\ntogether with eqs. 17-19 to find the intrinsic velocity dispersion \u03c30 . The sampling error in \u03c30 can be estimated\nfrom eq. 21.\nFinally, from fig. 10 we can estimate an approximate\nupper bound to the dispersion introduced by binaries in\ndwarf spheroidals. First we note that given an absolute magnitude limit Mlim < 1 and a stellar population\nolder than 1 Gyr, and if the distribution of binary orbital parameters mirrors that of the solar neighborhood,\nthe threshold fraction F0 cannot be larger than 0.12 even\nif the binary fraction is 1 (fig. 5). By analyzing multiepoch data in the Fornax, Carina, Sculptor, and Sextans\ndwarf spheroidals (Walker et al. 2009) we find they all\nhave threshold fractions smaller than 0.15, and only Fornax has F & 0.1. Assuming this is generally the case\neven for ultra-faint dwarf spheroidals with intrinsic dispersions greater than 4 km/s, we conclude from fig. 10\nthat the measured velocity dispersions of these galaxies\nare unlikely to be inflated by more than 20%. However,\neven if the dispersion of a particular galaxy is inflated\nby more than 20%, the correction due to binaries can be\nreadily discerned by making repeat measurements and\napplying the method outlined above.\n6.

Thus to find the correction\nto the dispersion with a given measurement error, one\nsubstitutes the error-free threshold fraction F0 in terms\nof F (\u2206v|\u03c32e ) (given by eq. 22) into eq. 16. The effect\nof the measurement error on the dispersion must also\nbe taken into account by making the substitution \u03c3 2 =\n2\n2\n\u03c3meas\n\u2212 \u03c3m\ninto eq. 16, where \u03c3meas is the measured\ndispersion and \u03c3m is the measurement error.\nIn summary, the velocity dispersion of a dwarf\nspheroidal sample can be corrected for binaries by the\nfollowing method:\n1. Measure the threshold fraction F for a particular threshold velocity and a time interval \u2206t = 1 year.\nThis can be done in two ways: the threshold fraction can\nbe measured directly, in which case one should use the\nsmallest possible threshold that is not unduly affected\n\nIn this section we discuss the problem of constraining properties of a binary population with radial velocity measurements taken at a single epoch. We approach\nthis by fitting the likelihood for binary stars (eq. 7) to\na simulated data sample generated from a Monte Carlo\nsimulation for galaxies with dispersions 4 km/s and 10\nkm/s. Both galaxies were given a binary fraction B = 0.5\nand period distribution parameters equal to their fiducial values \u03bclog P = 2.23, \u03c3log P = 2.3 (P in years). The\nsimulated velocities were generated with a measurement\nerror of 2 km/s. Using eq. 7 together with Bayes' Theorem, marginal posterior distributions in the dispersion\n\u03c3 and binary fraction B can be obtained. The maxima\nof these distributions are taken as the best-fit values \u03c3f it\nand Bf it .\nIn the absence of any constraint on the binary fraction\nfrom multi-epoch data, we assume a uniform prior in the\nbinary fraction. However, if repeat measurements do exist for some subset of the data sample, these can be used\n\n\f12\n\n(a) \u03c3real = 4 km/s, 100 stars\n\n(b) \u03c3real = 4 km/s, 500 stars\n\nFig. 12.- Best-fit values for the dispersion \u03c3f it in a simulated galaxy with dispersion \u03c3real = 4 km/s and different binary fractions B.\nThe solid vertical line gives the error bar, equal to one standard deviation in \u03c3f it values calculated in 300 random realizations, which is\nsimilar for all points on the graph.

The most rigorous approach would use a joint likelihood L(v1 , \u2206v|\u2206t),\nwhich can be generated from the Monte Carlo. This\nwould have the advantage that individual binary stars\nwhich are inflating the dispersion and exhibit a large\nvelocity change \u2206v would be recognized as such, and\nweighted accordingly. While this method may be necessary for obtaining constraints in small data sets of less\nthan 100 stars, for larger samples we can adopt a simpler approach: first derive a posterior P (B) in binary\nfraction by the multi-epoch analysis outlined in section\n4, and subsequently take P (B) as a prior in B for the\nsingle-epoch analysis. The usefulness of this method depends critically on the size of the multi-epoch sample,\nas this determines the constraint on binary fraction (see\nfig. 3).\nTo evaluate this method, it is important to know how\nthe best-fit dispersion \u03c3f it obtained by this procedure\nmay differ from the intrinsic dispersion \u03c3real due to small\n\nnumber statistics. To investigate this, we analyze samples consisting of 100 and 500 stars and repeat the procedure over 300 randomly generated realizations of each\nsample. The range of \u03c3f it values obtained for galaxies\nwith dispersions of 4 km/s and 10 km/s are plotted in\nfig. 12 and fig. 13, respectively. Also included are the\nresults if the prior in B is taken from multi-epoch observations of the same stars in the sample, in the manner\noutlined above. For comparison, we also plot the dispersion obtained from the biweight robust estimator, which\nis roughly comparable to the dispersion obtained by using a using a 3\u03c3-clipping routine. This plot shows the biweight is biased to large dispersions by an amount which\ndepends on the binary fraction; furthermore, the bias for\na 4 km/s dispersion is much larger compared to the error bars than for a 10 km/s dispersion. By comparison,\nthe best-fit dispersion \u03c3f it using a uniform prior in B is\nbiased by a smaller amount which depends on the true\nbinary fraction, up to 10%. However, if the prior P (B)\n\n\f13\nis calculated from multi-epoch samples of as few as 100\nstars, the bias is almost entirely removed. Thus, even a\nfairly weak constraint on the binary fraction is sufficient\nto remove most of the bias.\nUnfortunately, the likelihood analysis outlined above\nis of limited utility in actual data sets because of contamination by foreground Milky Way stars. The usual\ncriteria to determine membership of a star include its location on the color-magnitude diagram, metallicity, and\nradial velocity. Outliers in the distribution of these variables are either excluded, or else weighted by a low membership probability assigned according to a specific algorithm (cf. Walker et al. 2009). However, among the stars\nwith single-epoch measurements, only those stars which\nlie on the high-velocity tail of the velocity distribution\ncan help constrain the binary fraction. If even a small\nnumber of high-velocity binary stars are excluded from\nthe data or weighted by a low membership probability,\nthe inferred binary fraction will be biased to low values.\nIn principle this problem can be resolved by including\nthe velocity distribution of foreground Milky Way stars\nin the likelihood analysis, obtained by a kinematic model\nof the disk and bulge components (Robin et al. 2003).\nThe success of this method will depend critically on the\ndegree of overlap between the two distributions, which is\npartly determined by the systemic velocity of the background galaxy. It is also essential that binarity in the\nMilky Way is accounted for, since this adds a substantial high-velocity tail to the foreground velocity distribution. Accounting for binarity in the likelihoods of both\nthe foreground and background stars may also lead to\nimproved membership probabilities when combined with\nthe expectation maximation algorithm of Walker et al.\n(2009). Including both binarity and foreground Milky\nWay stars in a likelihood analysis is certainly of interest for obtaining the best possible constraints from\nsingle-epoch velocity data, but is beyond the scope of\nthe present work.\n7. FITTING FUNCTION FOR BINARY LIKELIHOOD\n\nFor the purpose of making analytic calculations as well\nas doing a likelihood analysis, it is useful to have a fitting function for the binary velocity distribution. This\ncan be found by investigating the exponent of the binary\nvelocity distribution. We find that the distribution indeed follows a log-normal but the dispersion changes at\na velocity scale v0 due to the suppression of binaries by\nRoche lobe overflow. This suggests the following fitting\nfunction for the binary distribution of velocities:\nfb (log |v|) = (1 \u2212 N )D(log |v|)\n)\n(\n\u22121\n2\n[\u03bclog P + 3G(log |v|)] ,\n+ N exp\n2\n2\u03c3log\nP\n\n(24)\n\nAs we discuss below, all the fitting parameters are contained in the function G(log |v|):\nG(log |v|) =\n\n(\n\n\u03b1 + s log |v|,\n\u03b1 + s\u2032 log vv0 + s log v0 ,\n\n|v| \u2264 v0\n|v| > v0 .\n\n(25)\nFor velocities |v| < v0 , the log-normal dispersion is\n\n\u03c3\n\nP\ngiven by \u03c3log |v| = log\n3s . The destruction of binaries due\nto Roche-lobe overflow becomes important for velocities\n|v| > v0 , for which the log-normal dispersion steepens to\n\u03c3 P\n\u03c3log |v| = log\n3s\u2032 .\nThe normalizing factor N (given by eq. 27 below) is\nnot a fitting parameter, but rather is determined by the\nother fitting parameters along with \u03bclog P and \u03c3log P . The\nfunction D, whose parameters are fixed, is given by\n2\n\nD(log |v|) =\n\n2\n\ne\u2212(log |v|\u2212\u01eb) /2\u03c3\u03b4\np\n,\n2\u03c0\u03c3\u03b42\n\n(26)\n\nand is effectively a smoothed \u03b4-function at very small v.\nWith v in units of AU/year, we find \u01eb = \u22123 and \u03c3\u03b4 = 1\nworks well with only slight deformation of the distribution at small v, however the exact values of these parameters are unimportant so long as the width and mean of\nD is sufficiently small. Although stars at such small velocities give a negligible contribution to the dispersion,\nincluding the smoothed \u03b4-function is crucial as it gives\nthe appropriate weight to the small-velocity stars.\nThe normalizing factor N in eq. 24 is given by\n3\n0.8\nN = q\n,\n\u00d7\n\u03b7(\u03bc\n2\nlog P , \u03c3log P )\n2\u03c0\u03c3log P\n\u03b7(\u03bclog P , \u03c3log P ) =\nx(s) =\n\nMV\n-1\n0\n1\n2\n3\n\n\u03b1\n0.260\n0.210\n0.240\n0.195\n0.152\n\ns\n0.998\n0.888\n0.938\n0.835\n0.737\n\n(27)\n\n1\n1\nerfc[\u2212x(s)] + \u2032 erfc[x(s\u2032 )], (28)\n2s\n2s\n3s log |v0 | + 3\u03b1 + \u03bclog P\n\u221a\n.\n2\u03c3log P\ns\u2032\n2.408\n1.920\n1.770\n1.467\n1.299\n\nv0\n2.500\n2.445\n2.389\n2.430\n2.470\n\nN\n0.785\n0.878\n0.836\n0.937\n1.056\n\n(29)\n\n\u03c3b\n2.741\n3.460\n3.448\n4.897\n6.986\n\nTABLE 1\nFitting parameters \u03b1, s, s\u2032 , v0 for binary velocity\ndistribution (eq. 24) for different absolute magnitude\nlimits MV . We also tabulate the normalization N and\nbinary dispersion \u03c3b assuming the fiducial period\ndistribution parameters \u03bclog P = 2.23, \u03c3log P = 2.3 (P in\nyears).\n\nThe fitting parameters are tabulated in table ?? for\ndifferent absolute magnitude limits Mlim ; for magnitude\nlimits in between the tabulated values, interpolation may\nbe used to find the fitting parameters. We also tabulate\nthe normalization N and binary dispersion \u03c3b assuming\nthe fiducial period distribution parameters \u03bclog P = 2.23,\n\u03c3log P = 2.3 (P in years). While these parameter values\nwere chosen with v in units of AU/year, converting to\nother units simply translates fb (log |v|) along the log |v|axis by an amount \u2206 log |v| = log \u03ba, where \u03ba is the conversion factor from AU/year. The conversion factor to\nkm/s is \u03ba = 4.741.\nThe function fb (log |v|) in eq. 24 can be conveniently\nused in place of eq. 6, which is computationally difficult.\nLikewise, it can be substituted in eq. 8 and integrated\n\n\f14\nnumerically to calculate the likelihood of binary stars in\na galaxy of given intrinsic dispersion \u03c3.\nIf the period distribution parameters \u03bclog P and \u03c3log P\nare varied from their fiducial values, the fitting parameters remain unchanged to first order (although the normalizing factor changes according to eqs. 27 - 29). Thus\nwe have the additional benefit that the binary dispersion\ncan be calculated and its dependence on the period distribution parameters is seen explicitly. Analytic formulas\nfor the binary dispersion are given in appendix 3. Here\nwe shall simplify matters by taking a log-normal distribution so that s = s\u2032 ; in this case, we find the approximation dispersion is proportional to\n\" \u0012\n\u00132 #\n\u0014\n\u0015\n(\u03bclog P + 3\u03b1) ln 10\n\u03c3log P ln 10\nexp \u22122\n\u221d exp 2\n3s\n3s\n(30)\nThus the variation of \u03c3b with the period parameters\nis quite distinct from its variation with B, which is linear (eq. 9). If one finds the dispersion up to a cutoff\nvelocity (of order AU/year), however, extra factors are\nintroduced (see eq. 50 in appendix 3) which mitigate the\nexponential dependence with \u03c3log P and \u03bclog P and nearly\nlinearize them over their viable range of values (roughly\nfrom 0-4 with P in years; see section 8). Thus if one\nchooses a cutoff vc = c\u03c3 where \u03c3 is the measured dispersion (e.g. c = 3), the dispersion is approximately linear\nin the period parameters, consistent with the expected\nnear-degeneracy with binary fraction. This reinforces the\nvery useful observation that the effect of binaries on the\nmeasured dispersion of a galaxy can be discerned from\nmulti-epoch data in a model-independent way.\n\u03c3b2\n\nFig. 14.- The behavior of the threshold fraction F (\u2206v) if the\nwidth of the period distribution \u03c3log P (P in years) is varied, plotted for different velocity thresholds \u2206v. The y-axis is given by\nf = F/F0 , where F0 is the fiducial threshold fraction assuming the value \u03c3log P = 2.3 observed in the solar neighborhood\n(Duquennoy & Mayor 1991).\n\n8. CONSTRAINING THE DISTRIBUTION OF PERIODS\n\nHere we address the question of what form the distribution of periods might take in regions beyond the\nsolar neighborhood, and whether this can be constrained\nby radial velocity data. Simulations of star formation\n(Machida et al. 2009, Tohline 2002, Bate 2000) indicate\nthat the statistical properties of binary systems are determined during star formation via turbulent fragmentation of a rotating gas cloud. The distributions in the\norbital parameters generally undergo little subsequent\nmodification by collisional processes, except in the highdensity regions found at the centers of globular clusters\n(Hut et al. 1992, Pryor et al. 1988). This suggests that\nthe distribution of periods in dwarf spheroidals and dwarf\nirregular galaxies may be of a similar form to that found\nin the solar neighborhood. We shall assume the lognormal is a fair approximation to the period distribution; it is reasonable to ask, however, to what extent its\nmean \u03bclog P and dispersion \u03c3log P may be expected to differ from that of the solar neighborhood. Because of the\ndifficulty of simulating binary star formation, at present\nwe have an incomplete picture of how these parameters\nmight vary depending on the star formation history of\neach galaxy. However, the following points can be made.\nA semi-empirical model of isolated binary star formation by Fisher (2004) yielded values of \u03c3log P within\nthe range 1.6-2.1, depending on the star formation efficiency of the initial gas cloud. Observations of premain sequence stars in Milky Way stellar associations\nalso show more peaked distributions than \u03c3log P = 2.3\n\nFig. 15.- The behavior of the threshold fraction F (\u2206v) if the\nmean of the period distribution \u03bclog P (P in years) is varied, plotted for different velocity thresholds \u2206v. The y-axis is given by\nf = F/F0 , where F0 is the fiducial threshold fraction assuming the value \u03bclog P = 2.23 observed in the solar neighborhood\n(Duquennoy & Mayor 1991).\n\n(Brandner & Koehler 1998). This suggests that the\nwider distribution observed in the solar neighborhood\nmay be formed by a superposition of more sharply peaked\nbinary distributions resulting from various star-forming\nenvironments. Accordingly, to be conservative in this paper we have considered values of \u03c3log P \u2208 (0.5, 4). Likewise we have considered values of \u03bclog P \u2208 (\u22121, 4) (P\nin years). The low-\u03bclog P , high-\u03c3log P boundaries of these\nintervals describe velocity distributions with a highly distorted, non-Gaussian shape and therefore can be considered unlikely.\nSupposing that \u03bclog P and \u03c3log P may vary by the\namount suggested by Fisher (2004), can these parameters be estimated independently of binary fraction? To\nanswer this question, we reconsider the threshold fraction F (\u2206v|\u2206t), defined as the fraction of stars with\n\n\f15\nan observed change in velocity greater than a threshold \u2206v after a time \u2206t between measurements. For\neach threshold, let us define the ratio f = F/F0 where\nF0 is the fiducial threshold fraction obtained by setting\n\u03c3log P = 2.3, \u03bclog P = 2.23. Given a time interval of 1\nyear and picking several thresholds \u2206v, we plot f as a\nfunction of \u03c3log P in fig. 14 and \u03bclog P in fig. 15. The similarity in slope among the different curves give a measure\nof degeneracy; if the curves were identical, the parameters would be completely degenerate with the binary\nfraction. However, if the difference between the curves\nis smaller than the statistical error bars, the parameters\nare effectively degenerate with B and we cannot hope\nto distinguish between them. The error bars on f at a\nparticular \u2206v are given by (compare eq. 43 in appendix\n2):\n2f\n\u01ebf \u2248 p\nN F\u0304 (\u2206vtail |\u2206t)\n\n(31)\n\nwhere \u01ebf is the 95% confidence limit in f , N is the number of stars and \u2206vtail is defined as before (for a rough\napproximation, given a measurement\n\u221a error \u03c3m one can\ntake \u2206vtail \u2248 2\u03c32e where \u03c32e \u2248 2\u03c3m . For \u2206t = 1\nyear and a measurement error of 2 km/s, fig. 4 gives\n\u221a\nF\u0304 (\u2206vtail ) \u2248 0.1 \u00d7 B. If B \u2248 0.5, this gives \u01ebf \u2248 9f / N .\nAssuming a sample of N = 100 stars, we have \u01ebf \u2248 0.9,\nfar too large to distinguish between the different curves\nin figs. 14 and 15. Thus to within the statistical error in\na sample of a few hundred stars, \u03c3log P and \u03bclog P are degenerate with the binary fraction over nearly the entire\nrange of figs. 14 and 15; only with N & 1000 are the error\nbars small enough to break this degeneracy. We conclude\nthat multi-epoch samples of \u2248 1000 stars or more are required in order to constrain the period distribution of a\npopulation of binary systems.\n9. CONCLUSION\n\nWe have demonstrated a procedure to estimate the intrinsic velocity dispersion of dwarf spheroidal galaxies\nmore precisely than in previous studies by accounting\nfor the effect of binary orbital motion. By measuring\nthe threshold fraction of a stellar sample (defined in section 3.2), the correction to the velocity dispersion due\nto binary motion can be estimated; fitting functions are\nprovided for this method (eqs. 16, 17-19). We have also\ndemonstrated a method to estimate the threshold fraction, together with other properties of the binary population, more rigorously from multi-epoch data via a\nBayesian or maximum likelihood approach. We conclude\nwith the following points:\n\n1. The dispersions of dwarf spheroidal galaxies between 4-10 km/s are unlikely to be inflated by more than\n20% by binaries (fig. 10). This conclusion can be made\nwith confidence because-as we showed in section 5-the\ncorrection to the dispersion holds independently of the\nmodel used to describe the binary population, provided\nthat the dispersion is calculated using a high-velocity\ncutoff (e.g., by a 3\u03c3-clipping routine). This is fortunate\nsince, as we showed in section 8, the binary fraction and\nother properties of the binary population (e.g., period\ndistribution) are very difficult to constrain independently\nof each other with samples of only a few hundred stars.\n2. With a measurement error on the order of 1 km/s,\nwe find that 1-2 years is an optimal interval between measurements for measuring the threshold fraction, since the\nfraction of stars with a measureable change in velocity\ndoes not rise significantly when the interval is extended\nbeyond 2 years (fig. 4). Furthermore, to constrain the\nbinary fraction and other properties of the binary population, it is a more profitable strategy to make two-epoch\nmeasurements over a larger sample of stars, as opposed\nto adding more repeat measurements to an already existing two-epoch sample. This is necessary to overcome the\nlarge scatter in the binary fraction of samples with less\nthan a few hundred stars. We also find that multi-epoch\nsamples of more than 1000 stars would be required in\norder to constrain the distribution of periods of a binary\npopulation independently of the binary fraction.\n3. While the binary population can in principle be\nconstrained by single-epoch data, in practice this is very\ndifficult because of contamination by non-member stars.\nSince an outlier in the velocity distribution cannot be\nverified as a binary star without multiple epoch measurements, it may be erroneously labeled a non-member\nstar and excluded from the data sample (or weighted\nby a low membership probability). This would bias the\nestimated binary fraction to low values, resulting in an\ninflated dispersion estimate. Even in single-epoch samples, however, this problem may be overcome by including a likelihood for the foreground Milky Way stars in a\nBayesian analysis. This analysis can also be combined\nwith multi-epoch data to provide better constraints, and\nin principle would extract the best constraints from both\nsingle- and multi-epoch velocity data.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nWe would like to thank Erik Tollerud for providing valuable feedback and many illuminating discussions\nthroughout the course of this project.

APPENDIX: CALCULATING THE THRESHOLD FRACTION FOR DIFFERENT MEASUREMENT ERRORS\n\nIn section 5 we showed how to correct the dispersion (eq. 16) by using the threshold fraction F , defined as the fraction\nof stars with an observed change in velocity greater than a threshold \u2206v after a time \u2206t between measurements. If the\nthreshold fraction is calculated directly from the data, then measurement error must be considered in eq. 16. While\n2\n2\nthe measured dispersion can be easily corrected for measurement error according to \u03c3meas\n= \u03c3 2 \u2212 \u03c3m\n(where \u03c3meas is\nthe measured dispersion and \u03c3m is the measurement error), correcting the threshold fraction is less trivial. To correct\nthe threshold fraction for measurement error, first we note that the degeneracy of the period parameters with binary\nfraction means that the velocity distribution can be approximately split into two parts: a small-v part which acts\neffectively like a \u03b4-function similar to that in eq. 10, and a large-v tail which scales linearly with B, \u03bclog P , and \u03c3log P .\nExactly where to do the \"splitting\" is dictated largely by the measurement error, as the tail becomes prominent only\nat velocities beyond \u2206v \u2248 \u03c32e . We therefore split the function at \u2206vtail = \u03b3\u03c32e where \u03b3 is a proportionality constant\nwith a very weak (if any) dependence on \u03c32e . The threshold fraction can then be written approximately as follows:\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u2206v\n+ BJ(\u2206v|\u03c32e )\n(32)\nF (\u2206v|\u2206t, B, \u03c32e ) \u2248 (1 \u2212 N )erfc \u221a\n2\u03c32e\nwhere\nJ(\u2206v|\u03c32e ) =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nerfc\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\u2206v \u2212 \u2206v \u2032 gb (log |\u2206v \u2032 |)\n\u221a\nd(\u2206v \u2032 ),\n|\u2206v \u2032 | ln 10\n2\u03c32e\n\nN = BJ(\u03b3\u03c32e |\u03c32e ).\n\n(33)\n(34)\n\nThe normalization factor N here has replaced B in eq. 14 and varies linearly with B, \u03bclog P and \u03c3log P . Now as long\nas \u2206v is approximately equal to or larger than \u03c32e , the error function in the integrand of eq. 33 is approximately a\nsmoothed step function. For \u2206v/\u03c32e & 1 we can therefore make the approximation\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2206v\nJ(\u2206v|\u03c32e ) \u2248 \u03b1\nF0 (\u2206v)\n(35)\n\u03c32e\nwhere F0 (\u2206v) \u2261 F (\u2206v|\u03c32e = 0) denotes the threshold fraction without measurement error. Note that in the limit\n\u03c32e \u2192 0 (\u2206v/\u03c32e \u2192 \u221e), the integrand of eq. 33 becomes a step function so that \u03b1 \u2192 1. On the other end, as \u2206v/\u03c32e\nis made smaller, the integral in eq. 33 includes more of the central peak so \u03b1 becomes larger. Using eq. 35, we can\nwrite N = \u03baF0 (\u2206v) where\n\u03ba=\n\n\u03b1(\u03b3)F0 (\u03b3\u03c32e )\n\u0010 \u0011\nF0 (\u2206v)\n\u03b1 \u03c3\u2206v\n2e\n\n(36)\n\nSince F0 is the tail of a log-normal distribution, over the scale of several km/s we have F0 (\u2206v) \u2248 (\u2206v)\u2212n where n\nis an exponent close to 1. Therefore \u03ba can be written as a function of \u2206v/\u03c32e :\n\u0013\n\u0013n\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u03b3 \u2212n \u03b1(\u03b3) \u2206v\n\u2206v\n\u0010 \u0011\n\u2248\n(37)\n\u03ba\n\u03c32e\n\u03c32e\n\u03b1 \u03c3\u2206v\n2e\nSubstituting this result into eq. 32, we have\n\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2206v\n\u2206v\nF (\u2206v|\u03c32e ) \u2248 erfc \u221a\n+\u03b2\nF0 (\u2206v)\n\u03c32e\n2\u03c32e\n\n(38)\n\n\f17\nwhere\n\u03b2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2206v\n\u03c32e\n\n\u0013\n\n\u2261\u03b1\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2206v\n\u03c32e\n\n\u0015\u001b\n\u0013\u001a\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0014\n\u2206v\n\u2206v\n.\n1\u2212\u03ba\nerfc \u221a\n\u03c32e\n2\u03c32e\n\n(39)\n\nEq. 38 is the key result: it means that the threshold fraction F with a given measurement error is related to the\nmeasurement error-free value F0\u0010 by \u0011a linear transformation, and the only extra information required to make this\ntransformation is the function \u03b2 \u03c3\u2206v\n. As a check, taking the limit \u03c32e \u2192 0 we have \u03b1 \u2192 1 and \u03ba \u2192 0, so that \u03b2 \u2192 1\n2e\n\nas it should. We use the Monte Carlo simulation to plot \u03b2 as a function of \u2206v/\u03c32e for different velocity thresholds,\nand find the function \u03b2 is nearly the same regardless of threshold, which justifies the approximations taken to reach\neq. 22. We find that for \u2206v/\u03c32e & 1, the parameter \u03ba shows only slight variation over the range for which the error\nfunction is non-negligible. We also find that \u03b1 is well approximated by an exponential, so that \u03b2 is well fit by the\nfollowing function:\n\u0010\n\n\u03b2(x) = 1 + ae\n\n\u2212 xxs\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\u001b\n\u0011\u001a\nx\n1 \u2212 \u03ba\u0304 * erfc \u221a\n2\n\n(40)\n\nwhere x = \u2206v/\u03c32e and the best-fit parameters are a = 0.05, xs = 5, and \u03ba\u0304 = 1.3.\n2. APPENDIX: FORMULA FOR NUMBER OF STARS REQUIRED TO CONSTRAIN THE BINARY FRACTION\n\nFor a set of N stellar velocities (with N > 100) measured at two different epochs separated by time \u2206t, consider\nthe number of stars n with change in velocity greater than some threshold value \u2206v. If n were to be measured over\nmany random realizations drawn from a particular galaxy, it would follow a Poisson distribution. For the time being,\nlet us take the measurement error \u03c32e to be zero. The mean number n\u0304 is related to the mean threshold fraction\nof binaries F\u0304b (\u2206v|\u2206t, \u03c32e = 0) by n\u0304 = N B F\u0304b where N is the total number of stars. If we pick \u2206v small enough\nsuch that p\nthis number is larger than 10, the Poisson distribution is approximately Gaussian with standard deviation\n\u03c3n \u2248 n\u0304 \u2248 N B F\u0304b . Since the fraction of stars is F = n/N , we obtain the error in the measured threshold fraction F :\n\u03c3F =\n\nr\n\nF\u0304 (\u2206v|\u2206t, B, \u03c32e = 0)\nN\n\n(41)\n\nwhere we also used the relation F\u0304 = B F\u0304b . Now if \u03c32e is nonzero, the smallest value of \u2206v which is largely unaffected\nby the measurement error will occur roughly at the point \u2206vtail where F\u0304 (\u2206vtail |\u2206t, B, \u03c32e = 0) = F\u0304 (\u2206vtail |\u2206t, B =\n0, \u03c32e ); this is where the \"tail\" in the distribution due to binaries begins to dominate. Therefore we pick this point\nas giving the best constraint on B. (For a rough approximation, one can also use \u2206vtail \u2248 2\u03c32e .) If we measure the\nfraction of stars with change in velocity greater than \u2206vtail , given by F = n/N , our \"best-fit\" binary fraction b is then\ndefined by F = bF\u0304b (\u2206vtail |\u2206t, B, \u03c32e = 0). Combining this with F\u0304 = B F\u0304b and eq. 41 gives the standard deviation of\nthe best-fit binary fraction:\n\u03c3b =\n\ns\n\nB\nN \u00d7 F\u0304b (\u2206vtail |\u2206t, \u03c32e = 0)\n\n(42)\n\nNow calling the 95% confidence limit \u01ebb = 2\u03c3b and solving for N yields eq. 15. The approximation becomes less\naccurate as B tends towards very small (close to zero) and large (close to one) values. If B is sufficiently close to zero\nsuch that n is less than 10, the Gaussian limit no longer holds; in that limit, the uncertainty will be larger than that\ngiven in eq. 42. If B is close to 1, the width of the Gaussian is larger than the true uncertainty since B-values greater\nthan 1 are not allowed. In fig. 3 the approximation formula is graphed as a function of N for several values of B and\ncompared to the 95% confidence interval of the posterior P (B) obtained from a Bayesian analysis of the simulated\ndata, averaged over a hundred realizations.\nUsing the best-fit binary fraction obtained by the threshold fraction at \u2206vtail , we can find the standard deviation of\nthe best-fit threshold fraction at a given threshold \u2206v by substituting the relations F = bF\u0304b (\u2206v|\u2206t, B, \u03c32e = 0) and\nF\u0304 = B F\u0304b into eq. 42, with the result\nF\u0304 (\u2206v|\u2206t, \u03c32e = 0)\n\u03c3F,f it = p\nN F\u0304 (\u2206vtail |\u2206t, \u03c32e = 0)\n\n(43)\n\nThis equation differs from eq. 41 in that it uses the best-fit binary fraction to infer the threshold fraction at thresholds\n\u2206v > \u2206vtail . Since the scatter in F is smaller at \u2206vtail , this leads to a better constraint than if the threshold fraction is\nmeasured directly. Comparing eqs. 43 and 41 and using the fact that the threshold fraction F decreases monotonically\nin \u2206v, we see that the error \u03c3F,f it < \u03c3F as expected. Eq. 43 approximates the error in the threshold fraction estimated\nby the Bayesian approach outlined in section 4.\n\n\f18\n3. APPENDIX: ANALYTIC FORMULAS FOR BINARY VELOCITY DISPERSION\n\nFor the purpose of making analytic calculations or doing a likelihood analysis, it is useful to have a fitting function\nfor the binary velocity distribution; this function was defined in section 7 (eqs. 24-25). If the period distribution\nparameters \u03bclog P and \u03c3log P and are varied from their fiducial values, the fitting parameters remain unchanged to first\norder (although the normalizing factor changes according to eqs. 27 - 29). Thus we have the additional benefit that\nthe binary dispersion can be calculated and its dependence on the period distribution parameters is seen explicitly. In\nterms of the fitting parameters given in eqs. 24-25 and tabulated in table 1, we find the following analytic formula for\nthe binary dispersion:\nN \u03ba2\n{f (s)erfc[\u2212x(v0 ; s)] + f (s\u2032 )erfc[x(v0 ; s\u2032 )]}\n2\nwhere \u03ba = 4.741 km/s is the conversion factor from AU/year, and\n\" \u0012\n\u00132 #\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\n\u22122(\u03bclog P + 3\u03b1) ln 10\n\u03c3log P ln 10\nf (s) = exp 2\nexp\n,\ns\n3s\n3s\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\n2 2\nx(v; s) = \u221a\n3s log |v| + \u03bclog P + 3\u03b1 \u2212 \u03c3log\nln\n10\n.\nP\n3s\n2\u03c3log P\n\u03c3b2 =\n\n(44)\n\n(45)\n\n(46)\n\nAlthough the normalization N also varies with the period distribution parameters \u03bclog P and \u03c3log P according to\neqs. 27-29, this variation is weak compared to the exponential dependence in f (s) (eq. 45). The binary dispersion \u03c3b\nis tabulated in table 1 assuming the fiducial period distribution parameters \u03bclog P = 2.23, \u03c3log P = 2.3 (P in years).\nOne can also find the dispersion with a velocity cutoff vc , according to which stars with v > vc are discarded from\nthe sample. We denote the dispersion with a cutoff as \u03c3(vc ). A little algebra shows that\n\u03c3 2 (vc ) = \u03c302 (vc ) + B\u03c3b2 (vc )\nwhere\n\nr\n\u0015\n2 \u2212vc2 /2\u03c302\nvc\n\u221a \u2212 \u03c30 vc\n,\ne\n=\n\u03c0\n\u03c30 2\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\u001b\n\u001a\n\u0014\nZ\nvc + |v \u2032 |\nvc \u2212 |v \u2032 |\n1 \u221e\n2\n\u221a\n\u221a\n+ erfc\n|v \u2032 |2 fb (log |v \u2032 |)d log |v \u2032 |.\nerfc\n\u03c3b (vc ) =\n2 \u2212\u221e\n\u03c30 2\n\u03c30 2\n\u03c302 (vc )\n\n\u03c302 erf\n\n\u0014\n\n(47)\n(48)\n(49)\n\nIf a cutoff is chosen such that vc & 2.7\u03c30 , then the first term dominates in eq. 48, and the first term in the integrand\nof eq. 49 dominates over the second term. The complementary error function can be approximated as a step function,\nin which case the integral can be done analytically with the result\nN \u03ba2\n{f (s) [1 + erf|x(v0 ; s)|] + f (s\u2032 ) [erf|x(vc ; s\u2032 )| \u2212 erf|x(v0 ; s\u2032 )|]}\n(50)\n2\nThe extra factor in eq. 50 introduced by the cutoff vc mitigates the exponential dependence of f (s) with the period\ndistribution parameters \u03c3log P and \u03bclog P ; indeed it nearly linearizes them over their viable range of values (roughly\nfrom 0-4 with P in years; see section 8). Thus if one chooses a cutoff vc = c\u03c3 where \u03c3 is the measured dispersion (e.g.\nc = 2.7), the dispersion is approximately linear in the period parameters, consistent with the expected near-degeneracy\nwith binary fraction. This reinforces the very useful observation that the effect of binaries on the measured dispersion\nof a galaxy can be discerned from multi-epoch data in a model-independent way.\n\u03c3b2 (vc ) \u2248\n\n\f"}
