It is shown that the presence of strong random potentials leads to a reduced dependence of\nelectronic properties on band fillings and to disappearance of the MH insulating behavior at integer\nfillings. A simple physical picture to explain this behavior is given using a notion of self-doping of\nthe MH insulator. Our results have important implications on some of the puzzling observations of\ncarrier-doped C60 in the FET. It is also discussed that the FET configuration with Al2 O3 dielectric\nprovides an \"ideal\" system with strong disorders.\nPACS numbers: 71.10.-w, 71.23.-k, 73.20.-r\n\nCarrier-doped C60 has been known to become a MottHubbard insulator (MHI) for most integer fillings of the\nthree (five) fold degenerate lowest unoccupied (highest\noccupied) molecular orbitals [1, 2], giving a special importance to certain fillings of the system. This is a general\nproperty of a Mott-Hubbard (MH) system, a good example of which is the cuprate high T c's in which an antiferromagnetic MHI with integer occupation is quickly converted to a metal and superconductor at modest changes\nof the band filling [3]. It is generally accepted that electron and hole doped C60 represents a MH system because the on-site Coulomb repulsion between electrons\n(U \u223c 1.5 eV) is considerably larger than the calculated\nband width (W \u223c 0.5 eV) [1, 2, 4]. Experimentally it\nis known that most integer filling C60 systems except for\nperhaps K3 C60 (see Refs [1, 2, 4, 5]) are in fact insulators\ncontrary to what one finds from a band structure calculation. The explanation for this is generally sought in terms\nof a MH scenario. The recently developed technique of\nelectron and hole doping using a field-effect transistor\n(FET) configuration [6] enables one to study a rather\nwide and continuous range of doping dependence of electronic states of C60 with clear advantages over the use\nof chemical doping. Some recent results [7] have already\nprovided us with spectacular surprises which at least in\nsome cases seem to contradict our general understanding\nof strongly correlated electrons; they do not show any\nindications of insulating behavior at or near integer fillings! Here we propose one of the possible and we believe\nplausible reasons for this behavior which has far reaching\nconsequences regarding the interpretation of the physical\nproperties of such field effect doped, correlated insulators.\nThe MHI is characterized by a system which, in spite\nof a partially filled band, has a finite single-particle\ncharge excitation gap defined by Egap = EI \u2212 EA =\nN +1\nN \u22121\nN \u22121\nN\nN\nEGS\n+ EGS\n\u2212 2EGS\nwhere EI = EGS\n\u2212 EGS\n(EA =\nN\n+1\nN\nEGS \u2212 EGS ) is the electron ionization (affinity) energy\nN\nand EGS\nthe ground state energy of the system with N\nelectrons as shown in Fig. 1(a) for a non degenerate band.\n\nAs demonstrated such a system also is characterized by\nlocal magnetic moments which may order below some\ntransition temperature. It is also clear from Fig. 1(a)\nthat this gapped situation for charge excitations only occurs for integer filling since both holes in the lower Hubbard band and electrons in the upper Hubbard band can\nmove freely. In Fig. 1(a) we see that the lower and upper\nHubbard bands are well-separated in energy by U which\nis the on-site coulomb repulsion of two electrons on the\nsame site.\nThe experimental observations in Ref [7] however suggest that nowhere in the electron or hole concentration\nregime in C60 in the field effect set up does such a gap\nin the minimum charge excitation spectrum occur, since\nthe resistivity versus gate voltage dependence is perfectly\nsmooth with no signs of strongly insulating regions. We\nbelieve that this could be a result of a non uniform potential at the C60 -dielectric interface which led us to study\nthe behavior of a MHI with strong spatial single particle\npotential variations.\nIn simple metals we expect a strong random potentials\nto increase the resistivity and perhaps even lead to localization of charge carriers [8] and insulating behavior.\nSo it may seem strange at first glance that in a strongly\ncorrelated MHI strong random potentials can lead to a\ndecrease in the resistivity and turn an insulator into a\nmetal. To understand how this happens we look at a\nsimple model consisting of a MHI with random on-site\npotentials added as external fields. As will be discussed\nlater, we believe that this is close to what actually occurs\nin the C60 -dielectric interfaces in the field effect devices.\nIn Fig. 1(b)(Fig. 1(c)) we demonstrate what happens if\none site for example has a large enough attractive (repulsive) on-site energy to overcome U . The physics is simple;\nthis site becomes doubly occupied but the electron (hole)\nmust come from a singly occupied site. Therefore aside\nfrom this site the remaining system behaves like a doped\nMHI which we know has a small or zero energy gap for\ncharge excitations.\n\n\f2\n(a) A=0\n\nabout U \u2212 Weff where Weff is the effective band width of\nthe lower and upper Hubbard bands, which is less than\nthe one particle band width due to interactions with antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations, and Weff \u223c 3\u20134t in this\ncase. In Fig. 2(b) we see the result for a random potential with A = 5t so that the total spread of the random\npotential is 10t. The gap for charged excitations is now\nall but closed and a metallic like situation will arise.\n\nEnergy\n\nEgap=U\n\nN\n\nUHB\n\nU\n\nN\n\nLUB\n\nEnergy\n\n(b) 0<U<\u2212A\n\nEgap=0\nN\u22122\n\nUHB\n\nU\n\n2\n\nN\u22122\n\nLUB\n\n|U+A|\n\n2\n\nEnergy\n\n(c) 0<U<A\n\nEgap=0\n\n2\nN\u22122\n\nUHB\n\nA\n\n2\n\nU\n\nN\u22122\n\nLUB\n\nFIG. 1: Schematic pictures of energy diagrams (left) and density of states (right) at the atomic limit for single band systems with on-site repulsions U between electrons; (a) uniform\nsystem, (b) system with one site having a large attractive onsite energy A (0 < U < \u2212A), and (c) system with one site\nhaving a large repulsive on-site energy (0 < U < A).

These pictures\nexplain self -doping of a Mott-Hubbard insulator induced by\na strong on-site potential energy.\n\nIn order to make this more realistic we look at some\nnumerical results using exact diagonalization of finite size\nsystems for the Hubbard model with a random on-site\npotential described by the Hamiltonian,\n\u0011\nXX\u0010 \u2020\nci\u03c3 cj\u03c3 + H.c.\nH = \u2212t\nhi,ji \u03c3\n\n+U\n\nX\ni\n\nni\u2191 ni\u2193 +\n\nX\n\n\u03b5i (ni\u2191 + ni\u2193 ) ,\n\n(1)\n\ni\n\nwhere hi, ji denotes a pair of nearest-neighbor sites, c\u2020i\u03c3\n(ci\u03c3 ) is a creation (annihilation) operator of an electron\nwith spin \u03c3(=\u2191, \u2193) at site i, and ni\u03c3 = c\u2020i\u03c3 ci\u03c3 [9]. We\ntake the random potential \u03b5i extending from \u2212A to +A\nand a constant probability in between these\nextremes.\n\u221a\n\u221a\nThe results are shown in Fig. 2 using a 10 \u00d7 10 site\ntwo-dimensional (2D) cluster with U = 8t where t is the\nhopping integral. In Fig. 2(a) we see the density of states\nfor 10 electrons (half filled) and A = 0 corresponding to\nthe uniform system. The gap for charged excitations is\n\nFIG. 2: (a) Density of states calculated\n\u221a\n\u221a exactly for a single\nband 2D Hubbard cluster with 10 \u00d7 10 sites and U = 8t\nat electron density n = 1.0.

(b) The same as in (a) but for the cluster with\nthe site-dependent on-site random potential extending from\n\u2212A to +A, where A = 5t is taken.\n\nThe variation of the gap for charged excitations with\nsystem size and with the size of the random potential is\nshown in Figs. 3(a) and (b). We see indeed that for a\nMHI with integer filling the gap rapidly decreases with\nincreasing disorder potential saturating at a value close\nto what is expected because of the finite size nature of\nthe calculation. The size dependence has been studied\nsystematically in 1D systems (see in Fig. 3(b)), which\nbehaves in a similar fashion in 2D. We also compare the\ngap as a function of disorder potential for non-integer\nfilling systems consisting of 8 and 6 electrons in 10 sites\nin Figs. 3(a) and (b), respectively. This system would\nideally be metallic for no disorder but for the finite size\nstill shows a gap because of this and then first the gap increases with increasing disorder potential and then turns\nover and decreases for large disorder potential and ends\nup close to that of the integer filled system. This result\n\n\f3\n\nEgap/t\n\nclearly demonstrates that a MHI with strong disorder has\na charge gap which is not or only weakly dependent on\nthe filling and that integer filling is no longer a special\ncase.\n\n(a) 2D\nU=8t\n\n: n=1.0\n: n=0.8\n\n4.0\n\n2.0\n\nEgap/t\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\n2.0\n\n4.0\n\n6.0\n\nA/t\n\n8.0\n\n(b) 1D\nU=8t\n\n: n=1.0\n: n=1.0\n: n=1.0\n: n=0.6\n\n4.0\n\n2.0\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\n2.0\n\n4.0\n\n6.0\n\n8.0\n\nA/t\nFIG. 3: (a) Averaged charge gap Egap sampling 100 random\npotential\nfor single band 2D Hubbard clusters\n\u221a realizations\n\u221a\nwith 10 \u00d7 10 sites and U = 8t at electron densities n = 1.0\n(solid circles) and 0.8 (open triangles).

One starts with a very pure crystal of C60\nand evaporates onto this the source and drain electrodes\nwhich often is gold. Then using plasma sputtering a thin\nlayer of 10\u201320 nm of Al2 O3 is sputtered onto the C60\nwhich serves as the dielectric and on top of this the gate\nmetal electrode. Upon application of a gate voltage calculations show that the charge carriers are concentrated\nin the first C60 layer at the C60 -dielectric interface. This\nmeans that even if the C60 surface layer was perfectly\nsmooth the C60 molecules at the interface will in fact\nexperience a spatially non uniform potential because the\ndielectric is not a single crystal. In fact for Al2 O3 the\ninterface C60 molecules will see in their close vicinity a\n\n[1] P. Rudolf, M. S. Golden, and P. A. Br\u00fchwiler, J. Electr.\nSpectros. Relat.

We\nnow recall that Al2 O3 is an ionic insulator stabilized to\na large extend by the Madelung potential set up by the\nionic charges. It is easy to see that the Madelung potential fields in the vicinity of the crystallite will leak\noutward to distances of at most several Al2 O3 lattice\nspacings and that the strength of these fields will depend\nstrongly on the crystallite orientation and termination.\nThe potential at distances of 0.3 nm from the interface\ncan easily be as large as \u00b12 eV and can also vary by\nthat amount depending on the crystal orientation and\ntermination. The Hubbard U has been measured on the\nC60 (111) surface and is found to be 1.6eV [4] and the\nband width is about 0.5 eV. Therefore indeed the spatial\nvariation of the potential can be expected to be of the\norder of the MH gap resulting in a strongly disordered\nsystem with a charge excitation gap which will be nearly\nindependent of the charge concentration.\nThis may be the answer to the question related to the\nabsence of insulating regions in the regions where integer\ndoping is expected but it also then raises a lot of other\nquestions. For example why is the mobility so high and\nwhy does the charge motion look like coherent band motion? We do not pretend to know the answer but it is\nimportant to note that we do not need a large density of\npotentials with variations of 1 eV or so. If 10% of the\ninterface C60 molecules experienced such potential fluctuations this is enough to wipe out the MHI regimes. This\ncould still leave enough space for percolating regions of\nweak scattering. Another very interesting thought could\nbe that strong disorder in the first layer could cause some\ncharge carriers to actually move to the second layer and\nthat the high mobility is caused by motion in the second\nlayer. We note that the Madelung potential like effects\ndecay exponentially as one moves away from the interface so the second layer would experience at most weak\nscattering effects. The question as to the influence on superconductivity remains an open question. Why would\ndoped carriers in such disordered systems favor a superconducting state rather than a glassy-like state which is\nlikely the case in \"dirty\" boson systems [10].\nTo summarize, we have studied the effects of on-site\npotential variations on a MHI and shown that strong disorder leads to a reduced dependence of electronic properties on band fillings and to disappearance of the MH insulating behavior at integer fillings. We also discussed that\ncarrier-doped C60 in the FET configuration with Al2 O3\ndielectric may provide an ideal situation for a strongly\ndisordered MH system. Our results explain some of\nthe most puzzling experimental observations for carrierdoped C60 in the FET.\n\n[4] R. W. Lof, M. A. van Veenendaal, B. Koopmans, H. T.\nJonkman, and G. A.
