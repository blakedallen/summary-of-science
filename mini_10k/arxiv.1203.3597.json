Using directional antenna on each\nnode can provide better spatial use of bandwidth and energy\nefficient preventive solutions for wormhole attacks.\nAdditionally, symmetric IDs can be dynamically changed to\nsolve Sybil attack of multiples false identities. All these\nissues are required to be addressed for strict friendliness\nverification between neighbor nodes in MANET, before\nnodes participate in the direct or multi-hop communications.\nThis is accomplished by packets encryption and decryption\nusing robust integration of different partial keys for each\npacket so that neighbors can be declared as strict friendly\nradios (also referred to as nodes). For encryption and\ndecryption, a set of partial keys are generated from the\nprivate information of nodes that includes location\ninformation (including distance and direction of node),\nsymmetric ID and round trip time (RTT) of preamble packet\nbetween two neighboring nodes to maintain the anonymity.\nThis prevents possible replay from the Wormhole attackers,\nSybil attackers and foe nodes.\n\nA directional information sharing can prevent\nwormhole endpoints from being camouflaged as false\nneighbors and reduce the intimidation of wormhole attacks,\nwithout any location information or clock synchronization\n[5], [7]. This scheme does not address the prevention from\nmultiple endpoint attacks, which requires substantial\namount of energy consumption. On the other hand, secure\nlocalization (SeRLoc) uses the geometric and radio range\ninformation to detect the wormhole attack and the Sybil\nattack on localization scheme in which only few nodes are\nequipped with directional antennas [8] which is an issue in\nthe overall design of a MANET. These can be alleviated by\nthe proposed scheme by using location information,\nsymmetric IDs and RTT assets to generate integrated key\nfor strict friendly verification and multiple endpoints attacks\ncannot succeed any more.\nRelated key cryptanalysis is a real-time attack in the\nkey integrity on the key-exchange protocols by an attacker\nflipping bits in the key without knowing the key and key\nfunction. This can be resolved by designing keys such that a\nkey in each round is randomly generated to prevent any\nrelated key cryptanalysis [12]. This can be made more\nadvanced by using different partial keys generated from\n\nThis paper is organized as follows: Section II provides\nthe related work; Section III describes anonymous\ngeographic parameters; Section IV describes security\n\n978-1-4244-8769-1 /11/$26.00 \u00a92011 IEEE\n\nRELATED WORK\n\n1\n\n\f2011 International Conference on Security Science and Technology(ICSST 2011)\n\nrandom number generator functions on each round keys\nusing different seeds so that related key cryptanalysis can be\ndeciphered. On the other hand, it is necessary to increase the\nkey sizes gradually for effective countermeasures against\nnew cryptanalytic insights to maintain a comfortable margin\nof security. This is based on explicitly formulated\nparameters and existing cryptosystems in symmetric\ncryptosystems, RSA, and discrete logarithm based\ncryptosystems [13]. This key size issue is addressed by\ndesigning optimal bits length integrated key scheme for\ncommercial security.\nIII.\n\nIV.\n\nWormhole attack is the direct network link to eaves\ndrop messages at one point of the network and replay at\nanother point, which sever multi hop spatial reuse in mobile\nwireless ad hoc networks. Wormhole attacks deploy the\nencrypted packets which they overhear from the legitimate\nnodes and replay them to create a major issue in filtering\nthose packets by any preventive cryptographic measures. In\nFig. 1, node A has off channel link known as tunnel to node\nB and replay cipher packets between node C and D. This\nissue can be addressed by using real time location\ninformation achieved from directional antenna, symmetric\nID and RTT assets to generate the integrated key for strict\nfriendly verification before multi hop routing of packets.\nReal time geographical information and RTT cannot be\nreplayed by the wormhole attackers as they are only virtual\nnodes with off-channel link. Even though they become\ncapable to replay the encrypted packet with the integrated\nkey, it will be no longer accepted by strict friendly verifier\nbecause two identical encrypted packets do not exist in the\nproposed SFV scheme. The reasoning is that the integrated\nkey is dynamically generated from the pseudo random\nnumber generation functions using two different seeds\n(Location, RTT) as well as data packet, and changeable\nsymmetric ID.\n\nANONYMOUS GEOGRAPHIC PARAMETERS\n\nEach radio or node has unique geographic location and\nRTT assets which can be deployed as anonymous\ngeographic parameters for strict friendliness. The location\ninformation includes radial or scalar Euclidean distance and\nangle between the sender and receiver which are computed\nfrom the average time difference of TOA (Time of Arrival)\nand TOD (Time of Departure) and the angular bearing by\nAOA (Angle of Arrival) for ith number of packets. The\nradial distance (DRadial) between sender and receiver is\ncomputed as the average time difference of arrival time of\npreamble packet at receiver and departure time of response\nfrom receiver to sender as follows:.\n1 n\nDRadial = c[ {\u2211 (ToDi \u2212 ToAi )}]\nn i =1\nRTT = T1 \u2212 T2\n\nwhere,\n\nSECURITY AGAINST WORM HOLE AND SYBIL ATTACKS\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\nSpeed of light (c) = 3\u00d7108 m/ sec\nNo. of packets for ranging (n) = 3 packets\nTransmission time from sender to receiver (T1)\nResponding time from receiver to sender (T2)\n\nFig. 1 Wormhole Attack\n\nFig. 2 Sybil Attack\n\nSybil attack is the adversary or illegitimate use of the\nmultiple identities to function as distinct nodes\nmasquerading. It is similar to wormhole attack as it also\nreplays the encrypted packets but using false identity. This\ncan attack the distributed storage, routing, data aggregation,\nvoting, fair resource allocation and misbehavior detection.\nIn Fig. 2, node S adversary uses the secret keys (identities)\nof three nodes N, O and P to replay node X as three\ndifferent nodes. Node X gets the false realization of three\nmore direct neighbors N, O and P except node R and S. This\ntype of bogus polymorphism identities are commended to be\nstrictly verified by a legitimate node. This issue is addressed\nby using a bunch of symmetric IDs along the location\ninformation and RTT for the integrated key generation. The\nsymmetric ID of a node is dynamically changed on each\nlink establishment to another node. Additionally, each\npacket is encrypted or decrypted by different integrated key\nand replay cannot fraud verifier, which possesses its\nrobustness.\n\nIn AOA, directional antenna-arrays are used to estimate\nthe direction of arrival (\u03b8) of the signal of interest and a\nsingle AOA measurement constrains the source along a line.\nThe precision of AOA depends upon the line of sight\nbetween sender and receiver. Additionally, RTT (Round\nTrip Time) is computed as the total time elapsed between\nthe transmission and the reception of the acknowledgement\nfor ith number of packet. This round trip time includes the\npropagation delay of the packet traveling in both directions\nand processing delay. The computed DRadial , AOA and RTT\nassets must be lower or equal to their corresponding\nmaximum range value, DMax _ Radial , AOAMax and RTTMax so that\nthe sender's request has not been \"replayed\" by wormhole\nor local nodes and proceed as seeds towards strict\nfriendliness. Otherwise, the sender's request is rejected and\nneeds to repeat with a second attempt with\nanother DRadial , AOA and RTT assets.\n\n2\n\n\f2011 International Conference on Security Science and Technology(ICSST 2011)\n\nV.\n\ncipher packets are computed using keys kj in decryption as\nshown in Fig. 4 using the following equations:\n\nPROPOSED STRICT FRIENDLINESS VERIFICATION\nSCHEME\n\nNeighbor nodes are essential to legitimately verify them\nas strictly friends so that they can co-operate in the secured\nlocation tracking through multi-hop communication. The\nnovel key in encryption and decryption for the strict\nfriendliness verification deploy 90 bits length integrated key\nand 12 bytes block size, which accomplish the minimal key\nlengths for symmetric ciphers to provide adequate\ncommercial security. The novel integrated key is generated\nas 90 bits key K= (K1 K2 K3) consisting 32 bits key (K1), 26\nbits key (K2) and 32 bits key (K3) to encrypt the packet at\nthe transmitter end. Each node generates K1 as pseudo\nrandom number using initial seed (i-1) in the RNG1 function,\nK2 is 26 bits unique IDTx of a node and K3 is generated by\nthe encryption of the first packet with the random number\ngenerated from RNG2 function using initial seed (n-1).\nFurthermore, the initial seed (i-1) for K1, is the location\ninformation (distance and direction) between transmitter and\nreceiver whereas the initial seed (n-1) for K2, is the RTT of\npreamble packet between them. Then, first ensemble packet\nis encrypted using the first key K generated from the\nintegration of the location information, RTT and symmetric\nID. Similarly, the second key K \u0301= (K \u03011 K \u03012 K \u03013) is the\nintegration of K \u03011, generated from RNG1 function using first\nhalve of key K as seed i, K \u03012 same as K2 (symmetric ID)\nand K \u03013, generated from RNG2 function using second halve\nof key K as seed n. Then, the second ensemble packet is\nencrypted using second key K \u0301 and this encryption\nprocedure is iterated for next packets. The cipher packets Cj\nfor jth number of plain\nensemble\npackets\nare\ncomputed using key kj in encryption as shown in Fig. 3\nusing the following equations:\nK i1 = RNG1 ( seed i )\n\n(3)\n\nK i 2 = IDTx\n\n(4)\n\nK i 3 = {RNG2 ( Seed n ) \u2295 Pi }\n\n(5)\n\nK i = {K1 K 2 K 3 }\n\n(6)\n\nCi = {EKi ( Pi )} = Pi \u2295 K i\n\n(7)\n\nK j1 = RNG1 ( seed i )\n\n(8)\n\nK j 2 = IDRx\n\n(9)\n\nK j 3 = {RNG2 ( Seed n ) \u2295 Cj}\n\n(10)\n\nKj = {K1 K 2 K 3 }\n\n(11)\n\nPj = {DK j (C j )} = C j \u2295 Kj\n\n(12)\n\nThe receiver is declared as a friendly neighbor node,\nwhen encrypted packets from the transmitter are\nsuccessfully decrypted by the receiver. It can be used for\ndirect or multi hop communication. If not, the node is\ndeemed as a suspicious node and is not authorized for\ncommunications. This process of strict friendliness\nverification between neighbors is required each time for\nsecure path connectivity for information exchange.\n\nFig. 3 Packet Encryption for Strict Friendly Verification\n\nFig. 4 Packet Decryption for Strict Friendly Verification\n\nRegarding the symmetric cipher, higher keys length\nprotect against brute force attacks. Increasing each bit in the\nkey increases twice the number of possible keys and yields\ntwo times more search for the brute force attack. With 90bits key, the complexity analysis of algorithm needs O (290)\n= 1.237940039 \u00d7 1027 runs for the brutal force search. On\naverage, a brute force attack must check half of the total\nruns, performing 289 encryptions, to find the key. This 90\nbits key length is enough for the symmetric ciphers to\nprovide plentiful commercial security.\n\nAt the receiver end, the first packet is decrypted by\nusing key K=(K1 K2 K3) where, K1 is the 32 bits key\ngenerated using initial seed (i-1) which is the location\ninformation between transmitter and receiver in RNG1, K2\nis the 26 bits unique IDRx of node and K3 is 32 bits key\ngenerated by the decryption of the first encrypted packets\nwith the random number generated from RNG2 function\nusing the initial seed (n-1) which is the RTT between\ntransmitter and receiver. Regarding second packet, the\ndecryption is done by changing K \u03011 and K \u03013 generated by\nRNG functions with new seeds achieved after halving the\nprevious key and this decryption procedure is iterated for\nnext packets. The plain ensemble packets Pj for jth number of\n\nThe detection rate is the probability of detecting an\nunfriendly or foe node in MANET cluster which evaluates\nthe detection performance of strict friendliness verification\nscheme. Let us consider a suspicious transmitting node\nsends request to the receiver node, such that it could\npersuade as a friendly node and avoid being detected during\nthe strict friendly verification process, with the probability\n\n3\n\n\f2011 International Conference on Security Science and Technology(ICSST 2011)\n\nof replayed by wormholes (pwh), probability of node's ID\nreplay (pi) and the probability of locally RTT replayed (pr)\nby neighbors. Then, the probability of detection of replayed\nby wormholes is (1-pwh), the probability of detection of\nnode's ID replay is (1-pi) and the probability of detection of\nlocally RTT replayed (1-pr) in the strict friendliness\nverification. The probability of suspicious node detection by\na friendly node is computed as:\nP = (1 \u2212 pwh )(1 \u2212 pi )(1 \u2212 pr )\n\nscanning is done by transmitter at the range of 230 m using\nsteerable directional antenna and if it could not find any\ndesired node then second scanning is done at the range of\n250m by increasing the transmission power and similarly,\nthird scanning is done at the range of 270 m. The major\nadvantage of the ranging method is that it utilizes the\nminimum transmission power to the optimum extent, where\nas the non-ranging method uses the full power to cover the\nfull transmission range of 270 m at the first instance.\n\n(13)\n\nTABLE -I\nSFV SIMULATION PARAMETERS\nSimulation parameters\nValues\n\nWhen each detecting node having n detection IDs, the\ndetection rate or probability (Pdr) of a suspicious node being\ndetected by a kind friendly detecting node can be computed\nas:\n\nArea (sq.m)\n\n3000 X 3000\n\nRadio range (m)\n\n230, 250, 270\n\nNodes in each cluster\n\n80\n\nTransmission rate (Kbps)\n\nPdr = 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 p n ) = 1 \u2212 {1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 pwh )(1 \u2212 pi )(1 \u2212 pr )}n (14)\n\n200-2000\n\nMobility model\n\nThis implies that unless the detection probability\nincreases, the detection rate cannot be increased.

The location information is computed from the average\ntime difference of TOA and TOD of the preamble packet\nand the AOA of preamble packet determined by the\ndirectional antenna arrays. Similarly, RTT is computed from\nthe TOA packets in the time domain. Both the location\ninformation and the RTT are taken using the ranging and\nnon-ranging methods. In the ranging method, the\ntransmission power is increased while scanning for the\nneighbor nodes.

From our\nsimulation, a maximum of 33 nodes are detected in third\nclusters as suspicious nodes as shown in Fig. 7.

This outstanding detection rate of almost 100% is\nachieved by using eight different symmetric keys for strictly\nfriend verification in all clusters because, the ID replay\nentirely solved as the best case. This can be better illustrated\nby the detection rate analysis which shows that if the\ndetection rate by a single ID is about 30-40% then detection\nrate will be approximately 100% using more than six\nsymmetric IDs. Therefore, it can be concluded that the\nsymmetric IDs of more than six yield outstanding detection\nrate, Pdr6 =1-(1-P)6, where as the detection rate using a single\nID, Pdr1 =1-(1-P) yields about 40% resulting from P=\n(1\u2212pwh)(1\u2212pi)(1\u2212pr).\n\nEnd to End Delay with/ without Strictly Friendliness Verification (SFV)\n\nAverage End to end Delay in sec\n\n2.5\n\nThroughput is the average rate of successful packets\ndelivery over a communication channel which becomes\nsaturated at a certain transmission rate when the channel\ncapacity is fully utilized.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION\nIn the proposed integrated key based SFV addressed both\nthe geographic information as well as anonymous symmetric\nidentity of node, to resolve Wormhole and Sybil attacks in\nMANET. The detection rate of foe nodes is found to be 95%\nusing six symmetric IDs in simulation. SFV with ranging\nhave similar performance in terms of aggregate throughput,\naverage end to end delay and packet delivered ratio as\ncompared to SFV and without SFV. In conclusion, the SFV\nwith dynamic ranging has significantly lower computational\noverhead, which makes it pragmatic and reliable in real-time\nco-operative MANET.\n\n[10] Gilles Guette and Bertrand Ducourthial, \"On the Sybil attack detection\nin VANET\", Laboratoire Heudiasyc UMR CNRS 6599, Universit \u0301ede\nTechnologie de Compi`egne, France, 1-4244-1455-5/07/, 2007 IEEE.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\n\n[11] Shukor Abd Razak, Normalia Samian, Mohd.
